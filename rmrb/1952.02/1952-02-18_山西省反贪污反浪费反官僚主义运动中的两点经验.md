Comprehensive report from our newspaper:

    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has rapidly unfolded throughout Shanxi Province. By early February, most areas had entered the intense stage of encircling and suppressing the "big tigers." The strongholds of major corrupt elements have been breached in many places. Special district and county-level authorities have formulated combat plans and begun fighting. Some special districts and county-level authorities have already captured many corrupt elements. Throughout the province, the situation of besieging major corrupt elements has initially taken shape. During this phase of the movement, Shanxi Province has gained preliminary experience on how to break through the strongholds of major corrupt elements and how to overcome right-leaning tendencies and break through backward areas.

    1.  How to Encircle and Suppress Major Corrupt Elements

    Encircling and suppressing major corrupt elements is a fierce and arduous struggle. Major corrupt elements are extremely cunning. Bravery without strategy cannot defeat them. Large corruption cases invariably involve collusion between corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants. Almost without exception, these people formed "alliances of offense and defense" before and after the start of the movement. In the early stages of the movement, the masses in some units were very courageous and vehemently fought against the major corrupt elements, but the results were not as expected. Many authorities learned from this lesson and, after fully mobilizing the masses, immediately guided and organized them to strengthen investigation and research. Although the "big tigers" are cunning, they have many internal contradictions and weaknesses. Based on this situation, many units adopted the method of attacking from above and below and encircling from within and without. They severed the connection between corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants and selected activists to organize "tiger hunting teams" to conduct investigations and research in various relevant areas. Some authorities not only conducted investigations in their own cities but also sent people to Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai to gather materials. While conducting investigation and research, it is also necessary to carry out mobilization work among the families of corrupt elements. Although the families of corrupt elements are mostly unable to completely stand on the side of the state and the people to denounce their relatives, they can still play a role in persuading the corrupt elements to confess in order to find a way out for their relatives. Wang Yaowu, the "big tiger" of the Shanxi Construction Company, was captured under this kind of double-pronged attack. Wang Yaowu was formerly a feudal foreman and later a contractor. After entering the Shanxi Construction Company, he and his cronies collectively embezzled over 170 million yuan. In this movement, Wang Yaowu refused to confess. Even after being denounced at the confession and denunciation meeting, he still insisted that he was "clean-handed," admitting to "bribery" but not to corruption. No matter how much persuasion and questioning, he always stubbornly denied it. Later, the Basic Construction Department of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Industry changed its approach and adopted the method of investigation, accounting, and attacking from within and without. The masses patiently and carefully calculated and checked all of his income and expenses since he joined the Shanxi Construction Company, as well as the amount of bribes he admitted to, and found loopholes in them to question him. At the same time, they also conducted in-depth investigations at a construction site in Yuncheng where Wang Yaowu worked. There, Wang Yaowu's corruption group had already been shaken and divided, and some people had begun to confess. The person in charge of the investigation seized Zhao Fuzhi, who was Wang Yaowu's accountant at the time, and repeatedly educated him, explained the policies, and clarified the advantages and disadvantages. Zhao Fuzhi exposed the situation of Wang Yaowu and others' collective corruption at the time. From here, the collective corruption accounts of Wang Yaowu and others were finally found. After grasping this evidence, the masses launched a fierce attack on Wang Yaowu. Wang Yaowu panicked and even expressed his intention to commit suicide. The leadership seized this opportunity and sent someone to mobilize his wife, telling her that Wang Yaowu had expressed his intention to commit suicide and asking her to persuade him to confess. After Wang Yaowu returned home that day, his wife tried her best to persuade him to find a way out through confession. Under this double-pronged situation, Wang Yaowu's fortress was finally breached. The next day, he took the赃物 (translator note: loot) and confessed his crimes to the leadership.

    Concentrating forces to break the "alliance of offense and defense" between corrupt elements and between corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants is a decisive step in catching "tigers." Regarding this issue, the Shanxi Provincial Committee for Thrift and Inspection announced the following policy at the confession and denunciation meeting of provincial-level authorities: "Those who instigate the establishment of alliances of offense and defense and refuse to confess will be severely punished; those who can first expose the conspiracy of establishing alliances of offense and defense and can thoroughly confess will be given leniency or exemption from punishment as appropriate. Those who refuse in advance but report afterwards will offset their crimes with their merits." This method shattered the "alliances of offense and defense" of many corrupt elements. After the meeting, many corrupt elements rushed to confess their conspiracy to establish "alliances of offense and defense" to the leadership. The masses in many authorities have created many ingenious and effective ways to break through the "alliances of offense and defense."

    2.  How to Reverse Right-Leaning Thought and Break Through Backward Areas

    The development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Shanxi Province is very uneven. Especially in January, many authorities took detours in the movement to varying degrees. The leading cadres of many authorities lacked sufficient understanding of the serious significance of this struggle, did not study the instructions of higher authorities well, did not implement them firmly, were inept in directing the battle, and were powerless in the struggle, at a loss when facing "fortresses." Some leaders of authorities showed serious bureaucracy in the movement, were numb and indifferent, and did not recognize the universality and seriousness of corruption and waste, and could not see the rampant attack of the bourgeoisie against us. Those living in the countryside said: "We don't have a bourgeoisie here, so there's no talk of bourgeois erosion and influence"; those living in the city said: "We are administrative departments, clean agencies, there is no corruption"; those doing economic work said: "Our accounting system is very strict here, we can't be corrupt, at most we'll round off to zero." Therefore, these authorities did not have any ideological preparation for battle at the beginning of the movement. Before January 10, this situation was common and serious in most special district and county authorities. There was also a type of authority that started the movement very well, with great fanfare and vigor. The leading cadres of these authorities thought that this was "good enough" and prepared to wind up. However, the movement did not go deep, the masses were not fully mobilized, the petty corrupt elements were not completely brought out, and the major corrupt elements were not discovered at all. In fact, the problem was not solved at all. The Linfen Special Commissioner's Office-level authorities were like this. There were also some units where the problems themselves were very serious, and most of the leading cadres had serious bureaucratic styles. These people were commanding the battle with burdens on their backs. The movement started for a long time, but they were still at a loss and gained little. The situation in the Yangquan Industrial and Mining Area was like this. In response to these situations, the Shanxi provincial leadership focused on criticizing numb and indifferent right-leaning sentiments, and at the same time took the following specific steps:

    1.  Led by members of the CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee, they promoted the responsible cadres of various levels of authorities to conduct serious self-criticisms to the cadres of their subordinate authorities. If they failed once, they would do it twice. The CPC Shanxi Provincial Committee also required the responsible党员 (translator note: party member) cadres of provincial-level authorities to conduct a self-criticism to the Provincial Committee before or after making a self-criticism to their own authorities. In this way, the effect of attacking from above and below can be achieved, so that these leading cadres can completely change their bureaucratic style and bravely command the battle. For those leading cadres who suppress democracy and refuse to confess, they will be resolutely replaced in order to remove obstacles to the movement. In January, Shanxi Province replaced two special district-level cadres and more than forty county-level cadres.

    2.  The Provincial Committee sent strong cadres to units with backward movements and serious problems to guide the movement there and to support the masses there. In January, the Provincial Committee had already sent eleven prefectural committee-level cadres to focus on. For example, the problems in the Yangquan Industrial and Mining Area were very serious, but the leading cadres there were not united and were very powerless in directing the movement. Later, the Provincial Committee sent Yue Zongtai, Secretary of the CPC Yuci Prefectural Committee, Xi Jingshan, Director of the Secretariat of the Provincial People's Inspection Committee, and Jia Huisheng, Deputy Director of the党员 (translator note: party member) Management Office of the Organization Department of the Provincial Committee, to guide the movement. Finally, Xie Xuegong, First Deputy Secretary of the Provincial Committee, personally went there. In this way, the dull and stalemate situation in the Yangquan Industrial and Mining Area movement was finally broken, and the hesitation and wavering of the commanders in combat were reversed. Many major corrupt elements were captured in a week. The momentum of the commanders and fighters in Yangquan was greatly boosted.

    3.  The Provincial Committee sent inspection teams to inspect and promote the movements in various regions. This method has had a great effect on the development of the movement in various special districts. For example, after accepting the opinions of the Provincial Committee's inspection team, Ma Guishu, Secretary of the Xinxian Prefectural Committee, and all members of the prefectural committee immediately took action to correct their mistakes of lacking a fighting stance. In this way, the situation changed greatly in less than three days, and the movement developed very rapidly and vigorously. Originally, their movement had been going on for more than half a month, and they thought there was nothing wrong, but they found a large number of corrupt elements, which greatly surprised them.

    4.  The responsible comrades of the Provincial Committee divided their responsibilities and personally directed and inspected the movement situation in various provincial-level authorities. And the experience of the provincial-level authorities was disseminated to command the movements in various places through newspapers, radio stations, telegram bulletins, or sending people down, etc. At the same time, Comrade Xie Xuegong broadcasted once or twice a week on the radio station, specifically to guide the movement in special districts and county-level authorities, commending the good, criticizing the bad, correcting mistakes, and introducing experience. Using this method to direct the struggle in special districts and county-level authorities is rapid and effective.

    Now the Shanxi Provincial Committee is giving specific instructions to backward areas on the one hand, and continuing to send strong cadres and a large number of inspection teams on the other hand, to guide and promote the movement in these areas.

    山西省反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中的两点经验
    本报综合稿
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动在山西省全省范围内已经迅速展开。二月初，大部地区已进入紧张的围剿“大老虎”阶段。大贪污分子的堡垒已被攻破很多。专区和县级机关已经制定作战计划，并开始了战斗。有些专区和县级机关已经捉到了不少的贪污分子。在全省范围内，围攻大贪污犯的形势已经初步形成。在这一时期的运动中，对于如何突破大贪污分子的堡垒，如何克服右倾情绪，突破落后地区，山西省已经获得初步经验。
    一、怎样围剿大贪污分子
    围剿大贪污分子是一场激烈艰苦的斗争。大贪污分子十分狡猾。有勇无谋，是不能斗倒他们的。大的贪污案件无例外的是贪污分子和奸商勾结共谋的。这些人在运动开始前后，几乎无一例外地订了“攻守同盟”。在运动的前一阶段，有些单位的群众勇气很足，声势浩大地向大贪污分子大斗了一阵，但结果没有得到应有的效果。许多机关接受了这个教训，在放手发动群众之后，立即引导、组织群众加强调查研究工作。“大老虎”们虽然狡猾，但他们内部的矛盾和弱点是很多的。根据这一情况，许多单位采取了上下夹攻、内外围剿的办法。割断贪污分子和奸商的联系，挑选积极分子组织“打虎队”，到各个有关方面进行调查研究。有些机关不仅在本市进行调查，还派人到北京，天津、上海调查，取得材料。在调查研究的同时，还须在贪污分子的家属中进行动员工作。贪污分子的家属们虽然多半不能够完全站在国家、人民的立场上去检举自己的亲人，但是为了给自己的亲人找寻出路，他们在动员贪污分子坦白这一方面还是有作用的。山西建筑公司的“大老虎”王耀武，就是在这种内外夹击的阵势下被捕获的。王耀武从前是一个封建把头，后来又做包商，钻入山西建筑公司后，曾和他的爪牙集体贪污一亿七千多万元。在这次运动中，王耀武拒不坦白。甚至在坦白检举大会上被人检举出来后，仍然一口咬定说自己是“两袖清风”，承认“行贿”，不承认贪污，任凭怎样动员追问，总是死不承认。以后，山西省工业厅基本建设处改变了方针，采取调查算账，内外夹击的办法。群众耐心地把他到山西建筑公司以后所有的收入、支出以及他所承认的行贿数目仔细计算核对，从中找出破绽，以此进行追问。同时，又到王耀武所工作的运城某工地进行深入的调查。在那里，王耀武的贪污集团已经动摇分化，有的人已经开始坦白。负责调查的人抓住了当时替王耀武当会计的赵福植，对他反复进行教育，交代政策，讲清利害。赵福植检举了王耀武等当时集体贪污的情况。从这里终于找出了王耀武等的集体贪污账。抓住了这些证据以后，群众向王耀武展开了猛烈的攻击。王耀武恐慌了，甚至表示要自杀。领导方面又抓住这一机会，派人动员他的妻子，告诉她王耀武曾表示要自杀，要她动员他坦白。当天王耀武回家后，他的妻子就极力动员他从坦白中找出路。在这种内外夹击的情势下，王耀武这个堡垒终于被攻破了。第二天，他就拿上赃物，找领导方面坦白了自己的罪恶。
    集中力量，攻破贪污分子之间以及贪污分子和奸商之间的“攻守同盟”，是捕捉“老虎”的具有决定性的步骤。对于这个问题，山西省节约检查委员会在省直机关坦白检举大会上宣布了这样的政策：“凡主谋订立攻守同盟而又拒不坦白者，加重惩处；凡能首先揭发订立攻守同盟的阴谋，并能彻底坦白者，酌情减轻或免予处分。事先拒绝、事后又告密者，将功折罪。”这个办法，粉碎了许多贪污分子的“攻守同盟”。会后，许多贪污分子争先恐后地向领导方面坦白他们订立“攻守同盟”的阴谋。许多机关的群众创造出了许多巧妙有效的突破“攻守同盟”的办法。
    二、怎样扭转右倾思想突破落后地区
    山西省全省的反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动的开展是很不平衡的。特别是在一月份内，许多机关在运动中都或多或少地走了弯路。许多机关的领导干部对这次斗争的严重意义认识不足，对上级指示没有很好钻研，执行不坚决，在战斗中指挥无方，斗争无力，对“堡垒”束手无策。有些机关的首长在运动中表现出严重的官僚主义，麻木不仁，不承认贪污浪费现象的普遍性和严重性，看不见资产阶级对我们的猖狂进攻。住在乡下的说：“我们这里没有资产阶级，谈不到资产阶级的侵蚀和影响”；住在城里的说：“我们是行政部门，清水衙门，没有贪污”；做经济工作的则说：“我们这里会计制度很严格，不能贪污，顶多抹个零头。”因此，这些机关在运动开始时根本就没有进行战斗的思想准备。一月十日以前，这种情况在多数专区、县机关中是普遍而且严重的。还有一类机关，在运动开始时搞得很好，大张旗鼓，轰轰烈烈。这些机关的领导干部以为这样就“差不多了”，准备收场。但是运动没有深入下去，群众没有充分发动，小贪污分子没有完全搞出来，大贪污犯根本没有发现，实际上根本没有解决问题。临汾专署级机关就是这样的。还有一些单位，本身问题十分严重，大部分领导干部都有着严重的官僚主义作风。这些人是背着包袱指挥战斗。运动开始了很久，仍然一筹莫展，收获不大。阳泉工矿区的情况就是这样。山西省领导方面针对这些情况，着重地批判了麻木不仁的右倾情绪，同时采取了以下几个具体步骤：
    一、由中共山西省委会委员带头，推动各级机关的负责干部向所属机关的干部进行认真的检讨，一次通不过，再来二次。中共山西省委还要求省级各机关的党员负责干部，在向自己机关作检讨的以前或以后，到省委进行一次自我检讨。这样就可以收到上下夹攻之效，使这些领导干部彻底转变官僚主义的作风，勇敢地指挥战斗。对于那些压制民主，拒不坦白的领导干部，则坚决撤换，以便扫除运动的障碍。在一月份内，山西省撤换了两个专区级的干部和四十多个县级干部。
    二、省委派出强有力的干部，到运动落后和问题严重的单位去，指导那里的运动，给那里的群众撑腰作主。在一月份中，省委已有重点地派出地委级干部十一人。比如，阳泉工矿区的问题十分严重，但是那里的领导干部互不团结，对运动的指挥十分无力。后来，省委派出中共榆次地委书记岳宗泰，省人民检查委员会秘书主任席荆山和省委组织部党员管理处副处长贾慧生去指导运动。最后，省委第一副书记解学恭又亲自前往。这样，终于打破了阳泉工矿区运动中的沉闷、僵持局面，扭转了指挥人员在作战中的犹疑动摇现象，一周中捉住了很多大贪污分子。阳泉的指挥员战斗员的气势大振。
    三、省委派出检查组巡回检查和推动各地区的运动。这种办法对各专区运动的发展有很大作用。例如，忻县地委在接受了省委检查组的意见后，地委书记麻贵书和全体地委委员立即动手，纠正他们缺乏战斗姿态的错误。这样，不到三天，情况就大有改变，运动就开展得非常迅速、猛烈，原来他们的运动已经进行了半个多月，以为没有什么问题了，结果发现了一大批贪污分子，使他们大吃一惊。
    四、省委负责同志分工负责，亲自指挥、检查省级各机关运动的情况。并把省级机关的经验，通过报纸、广播电台、电报通报或派人下去等各种方式，传播下去，指挥各地的运动。同时，由解学恭同志在广播电台每周广播一次至两次，专门指导专区和县级机关的运动，表扬好的，批评坏的，纠正错误，介绍经验。用这种办法指挥专区和县级机关的斗争是迅速而且有效的。
    现在山西省委正一面对落后地区进行具体的指示，一面继续派出强有力的干部和大批的检查组，指导并推动这些地区的运动。
