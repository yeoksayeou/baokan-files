(Continued from yesterday)

Ma Yunsheng, manager of Fuxing Yu Ji Construction Company, even dared to adopt an attitude of resistance when the inspection team went to inspect, and hid and destroyed accounting books, showing extremely dishonesty. According to the facts that have been found, Ma committed illegal acts of cutting corners, stealing state assets of about 600 million yuan, and evading taxes of more than 22 million yuan. According to his own confession, he bribed cadres with 7.5 million yuan, and stole the bidding prices of the Yongdingmen Grain Warehouse and Fengtai Workers' Dormitory construction projects.

Li Changzhen, manager of Taicheng Hardware Store, consistently bribed our agency staff by inviting them to dinner, "borrowing money," going to parks, and finding prostitutes. Li committed the crime of acquiring state assets at low prices and selling them to various agencies and enterprises at high prices, obtaining illegal profits of nearly 360 million yuan. In the past year, the amount of tax evasion, excluding income tax which is temporarily impossible to calculate, is 6.5 million yuan for business tax and stamp tax alone.

Shao Baogui, manager of Dapeng Xin Ji Automobile Factory, had only 400,000 yuan in capital when he opened in September 1949. For more than two years, Shao has consistently bribed cadres when dealing with various agencies, and stole and swindled state assets by reporting inferior goods as good ones and reporting less as more. For example, in the spring of 1951, Shao bribed several drivers and cadres of the Marxist-Leninist Academy and obtained 1.25 billion yuan in automobile purchase fees. As a result, Shao purchased nine cars and stole and swindled state property worth 379 million yuan by reporting less as more. According to the materials that have been found, Shao bribed cadres with 42 million yuan, evaded taxes of 41.4 million yuan, and stole and swindled state assets of more than 585 million yuan.

Hao Yicen, manager of Ruixingxiang Printing Factory, bribed seventeen cadres from five agencies with more than 62 million yuan by "giving gifts" and forging invoices. When these agencies wanted to print goods or purchase paper, the corrupt elements would inform them in advance and even help with the valuation. Therefore, Hao was able to raise prices, secure orders, and openly steal huge amounts of state wealth. Hao also evaded taxes of more than 110 million yuan in various despicable ways. During the movement, Hao continued to resist and sabotage, and formed an "offensive and defensive alliance" with corrupt elements to protect each other.

Du Huiwen, manager of Wensheng Wood Factory, is a rogue merchant. The factory's capital was provided by traitors and spies Zhang Wenjin, Wang Fengchao, and others, and was obtained by Du through theft and fraud. Du has consistently seduced cadres, evaded state taxes, and stolen and swindled state assets. According to statistics from August of last year alone, Du bribed more than 2.4 million yuan, evaded taxes of more than 13 million yuan, and colluded with lamas to dismantle temples privately and steal state property worth more than 22 million yuan. Du also issued fifteen bad checks totaling more than 31 million yuan, disrupting the state's finances.

Shao Qingshan, manager of Dechang Construction Company, colluded with cadres to steal state property. In the projects he contracted, there was almost no place where he did not engage in illegal activities such as cutting corners, misappropriating materials, and reporting less as more, stealing a total of more than 460 million yuan in state assets. As a result, many projects did not meet the standards. In addition, Shao bribed more than twenty cadres with more than 10 million yuan successively, and evaded taxes on a turnover of more than 260 million yuan. After the start of this movement, Shao even pretended to be sick and hospitalized in an attempt to escape; and threatened employees to suppress whistleblowing.

Huazhong Yiji Leather Clothing Factory often did work for our military agencies. However, Zhao Guoshu, the deputy manager of the factory (the main person in charge of business), lost all conscience and consistently colluded with cadres, cutting corners and affecting military supplies. According to preliminary statistics, the factory colluded with more than twenty cadres. Using inferior goods as good ones, cutting corners, and using public office for private gain caused losses to the state of more than 430 million yuan. In January 1951 alone, the factory stole more than 10,000 feet of leather in the name of a certain military agency, obtaining illegal profits of more than 120 million yuan. In 1950, the factory made 8,000 pairs of cold-proof leather shoes for a certain military agency. The contract stipulated that they should be made of full leather, but the factory secretly used mostly side leather and cowhide, obtaining illegal profits of 51 million yuan. In addition, the factory used fake documents, fake accounts, fake purchases, and off-book activities to evade a large amount of taxes, which, according to investigations, amounted to more than 360 million yuan.

Lü Aiting, the former general manager of Tianfaxiang Grain Store, consistently failed to comply with government decrees. When processing grain for the public, he used shameless means such as adding water, adulterating, stealing, exchanging grain, and colluding with cadres of the grain company to overweigh the quantity to steal state property, totaling more than 70 million yuan. In 1949, when processing corn for the grain company, he watered it in advance, resulting in an extra 34,000 jin of corn flour for the 577,000 jin of corn being processed, obtaining illegal profits equivalent to more than 36 million yuan at current value. The store's tax evasion was also quite serious. In the past three years, the total amount of tax evaded reached more than 140 million yuan.

Yang Qixin, manager of Huitongzhan Yuji, and Zhang Yaowen, deputy manager, often used extremely bad means such as "introducing lovers," "eating with female waitresses," "whoring," and "becoming sworn relatives" to collude with agency cadres, and used the cadres who were dragged into the water to "borrow" public funds for speculation or lending for profit, thereby obtaining a large amount of illegal profits. According to statistics, they borrowed public funds for illegal activities totaling more than 550 million yuan, and bribed cadres with more than 50 million yuan in the name of "paying interest." In the past three years, they evaded a total of more than 60 million yuan in taxes. After the start of this movement, Yang and Zhang refused to confess and attempted to muddle through by tampering with accounts and "signing agreements."

Cao Guozhen, manager of Yitai Electrical Materials Store, had very little business at the beginning of liberation. By 1951, the annual turnover had risen to 2.1 billion yuan. However, Cao did not do business honestly, but specialized in colluding with cadres to engage in the business of stealing state assets. Cao bribed more than twenty cadres with more than 40 million yuan successively, and obtained huge profits by stealing bidding prices through bribed cadres. He also stole state assets worth more than 130 million yuan and evaded taxes of more than 50 million yuan by cutting corners, substituting inferior goods for good ones, and stealing materials.

Xu Wenru, manager of Beijing Fire Equipment Manufacturing Factory, and Lü Bingquan, deputy manager, had a capital of only 65 million yuan when they opened in September 1950. In 1951 alone, they earned more than 484 million yuan, of which more than 200 million yuan was evaded in taxes. In order to achieve the goal of grabbing huge profits, Xu often used bribery to collude with cadres. According to investigations, he had bribed staff members of more than ten agencies, with a total amount of nearly 70 million yuan. When Xu installed fire extinguishers for agencies, he often used inferior goods to replace good ones and cut corners to steal state assets, totaling more than 34 million yuan.

Li Shiyuan, manager of Jucheng Electrical Materials Store, consistently bribed and cut corners in undertaking state projects. In one project alone, Li bribed cadres with 26 million yuan; therefore, he unscrupulously cut corners; according to incomplete materials, he obtained illegal profits of more than 50 million yuan. In this movement, Li took the initiative to find corrupt elements, signed an "offensive and defensive alliance," and said to the corrupt elements: "You can drill holes, but you can't expose." When the inspection team came to the store for inspection, Li always resisted and did not say anything.

Li Ruitang, manager of Yong'an Tea House, consistently sought exorbitant profits, disregarding the interests of the broad masses of the people. He often sold inferior tea as good tea, and mixed a large amount of mulberry leaves and jujube leaves into the tea. In 1950 alone, he mixed more than 5,000 jin. Li also bribed and evaded a large amount of taxes, with a total of more than 670 million yuan in evaded taxes.

Wang Zihe, manager of Yihe Paper Mill, bribed cadres with more than 16 million yuan, and underreported turnover, evading taxes of more than 66 million yuan. Eleven-twelfths of the factory's capital is enemy property, and this part is now managed by the state-owned Yanjing Paper Mill. Wang used his "manager" status to misappropriate more than 170 million yuan of public funds to lend to relatives and friends, purchase raw materials, and sell them to the factory at high prices, causing the state to lose more than 620 million yuan. In addition, during the liberation of Beijing, Wang also stole a large number of equipment stored in the factory by state-owned enterprises such as the Water Supply Company and Yanjing Paper Mill.

Li Zhizhong, manager of Zenglong Zhiji Grocery Sugar Store, bribed cadres with more than 38 million yuan, stole state economic intelligence five times, and hoarded a large amount of sugar before the sugar price increased, disrupting the market, and the losses suffered by state assets cannot be calculated.
