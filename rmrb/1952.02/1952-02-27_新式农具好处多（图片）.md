New Farm Tools Bring Many Benefits

    Workers at the agricultural machinery manufacturing plant, in order to meet the needs of the vast number of farmers, have carefully manufactured a large number of new farm tools for the farmers, creating favorable conditions for agricultural bumper harvests.

    Using a new-style plow for plowing is not only labor-saving, effort-saving, and stable, but also plows deeper with finer soil pulverization. The surface of the land plowed with the new-style plow is very flat. This new-style plow can plow five to seven acres of land per day.

    Old-fashioned plows, because of their unscientific construction, are not only time-consuming and laborious for farmers to use, but also do not plow deeply. Using this old-fashioned plow can only plow three to five acres of land per day, which is much less efficient than the new-style plow.

    Workers are transporting large quantities of plowshares to the assembly workshop to install plow handles and plow beams.

    Using a new-style plow for plowing can reach a depth of six to seven inches, the soil is evenly pulverized, the grass is tightly covered, and there are no hidden ridges at the bottom of the plow, which is very beneficial for the growth of crops.

    Land plowed with an old-fashioned plow not only has a plowing depth of only about four inches, but also the turning and pulverization of the soil are poor, with many clods, the grass is not tightly covered, and there are hidden ridges at the bottom of the plow. These shortcomings seriously affect the growth of crops.

    Because the new-style plow has many advantages, farmers like to use it. Using a new-style plow not only saves manpower and animal power, but also the crops planted grow better than in land plowed with old-fashioned plows. For example, peanuts (see upper left picture) grow very vigorously when planted in land plowed with a new-style plow. The yield is also 20% to 30% higher than in land plowed with an old-fashioned plow. Another example is the growth of corn (see upper right picture), which is also completely different. Corn planted in land plowed with a new-style plow is seven feet nine inches tall after two months, but corn planted in land plowed with an old-fashioned plow is only five feet seven inches tall. These facts fully demonstrate that the benefits of the new-style plow are indeed greater than those of the old-fashioned plow.

    Using a four-row seed drill pulled by a horse for sowing, in addition to saving labor and effort, can also ensure uniform sowing, consistent depth, and tight covering, so the growth of crops is very neat. Using this new-style machine for sowing, only one and a half laborers and one animal are needed per day to sow about 40 acres.

    If an old-fashioned seed drill is used for sowing, not only is the sowing uneven, the depth is inconsistent, but also more seeds are used, so the growth of crops is not neat. Using this old-fashioned farm tool for sowing, three full laborers and one animal can only sow about 20 acres per day.

    Plowing one more time means harvesting a few more liters of grain. Therefore, hoeing is one of the most important parts of a successful harvest. Using a new-style three-tooth light weeding hoe for cultivating and weeding is easy and labor-saving during work, and the work efficiency is also high. Two people can hoe 25 acres of land in one day.

    If a new-style three-tooth light weeding hoe is not used, and one relies solely on a hoe for weeding, a strong farmer can hoe at most two acres of land per day.

    A horse-drawn swing-arm harvester can replace the work of 20 strong farmers. It can harvest about 70 to 80 acres of wheat per day. Using this new-style farm tool to harvest wheat is not only labor-saving, but also timely.

    The wheat ripening season is the busiest time for farmers. Relying entirely on a sickle, bending over to harvest, one can only harvest two or three acres of wheat land per day from morning to night.

    A sprayer is a kind of equipment for preventing and controlling crop diseases and insect pests. A single-tube sprayer requires only two workers per day to spray insecticide to prevent and control two to three acres of cotton fields. This is a scene of Bai Shouyuan, a farmer from Baijia Village, Liuguo Township, Bin County, Shandong Province, using a sprayer to spray cotton oil mud to treat cotton aphids.

    新式农具好处多
    农业机械制造厂的工人们，为了适应广大农民的需要，细心地给农民们制造了大批新式农具，为农业丰产创造了有利的条件。
    使用新式犁犁地，不但可以省工省力平稳，而且犁的也深，碎土又细。经过新式犁犁过的地，表面都是很平坦的。用这种新式犁每天可以犁地五亩到七亩。
    旧式犁因为构造不合科学原理，农民使用起来不但费时费力，犁地也不深。使用这种旧式犁每天只能犁地三亩到五亩，比新式犁的效率要低得多。
    工人正将大批犁头运送到装配车间去装置犁柄和犁辕。
    用新式犁犁地，耕深可以达到六寸到七寸，碎土匀细，盖草严实，而且犁底没有暗埂，对于农作物的生长益处很大。
    用旧式犁犁过的地，不仅耕深只有四寸左右，同时翻土、碎土也不好，坷垃很多，盖草不严，在犁底并留有暗埂，这些缺点严重地影响了农作物的生长。
    由于新式犁的优点多，所以农民们都喜欢用新式犁。用新式犁犁地，不但节省人力畜力，而且种上庄稼也比旧式犁耕过的地生长得好。如花生（见上左图），种在新式犁耕过的地里就生长得很旺盛。产量也比用旧式犁耕过的地要提高百分之二十到百分之三十。又如玉米（见上右图）的生长情况也完全不同，使用新式犁耕地种植的玉米，两个月后株高就有七尺九寸，可是使用旧式犁耕地种植的玉米株高却只有五尺七寸。这些事实，充分证明了新式犁的好处确实比旧式犁多。
    用马拉四行播种机进行播种工作，除了省工省力以外，并可以使下种均匀，深浅一致，掩盖严实，因此农作物的生长就很整齐。使用这种新式机械来播种，每天只要一个半劳动力和一匹畜力，就可以播种四十亩左右。
    如果用旧式耧来播种，不但下种不均匀，深浅不一致，同时所费的种籽也较多，因此农作物的生长也不整齐。用这种旧式农具播种，每天三个整劳动力和一匹畜力只能播种二十亩左右。
    多锄一遍地，多打几升粮，因此，锄地是农业丰产过程中重要工作之一。用新式的三齿轻便耘锄来进行中耕除草，在工作时既轻便又省力，工作效能也高，两个人一天就可以锄地二十五亩。
    如果不用新式的三齿轻便耘锄，而单靠锄头锄地，一个壮年农民，每天最多也只能锄两亩多地。
    一架马拉摇臂收割机可以抵上二十个壮年农民的工作。一天可以收割麦子七十亩到八十亩左右，使用这种新式农具来收割麦子，不仅省工，而又能及时。
    麦熟季节是农民最忙的时候，全凭一把镰刀，弯腰弓背地去割，一天从早到晚却只能收割两、三亩麦地。
    喷雾器是防治农作物病虫害的一种器械。一架单管式喷雾器，每天只要两个人工就可以喷射杀虫药水防治两亩到三亩棉田。这是山东省滨县刘郭乡白家村农民白寿元用喷雾器喷射棉油泥治棉蚜虫时的情形。
