    Local Public Security Bureaus Should Seriously Inspect the Products of Fire Equipment Factories
    To the Editor: I am a staff member of a certain fire extinguisher factory. I want to expose the crimes of the capitalists in the fire equipment industry. In order to pursue exorbitant profits, unscrupulous merchants manufacturing fire extinguishers are cutting corners and producing shoddy goods, thereby endangering the interests of the country. These poorly made fire extinguishers have not been inspected by a water pressure machine before leaving the factory, and the amount of chemicals used also varies. Some unscrupulous merchants even use acetylene tetrachloride to impersonate carbon tetrachloride, or fill the fire extinguishers with salt water. When used, these fire extinguishers may injure people due to the bursting of the machine body or cause problems due to corrosion and failure. What is even more hateful is that these unscrupulous merchants are also vigorously boasting in order to achieve the purpose of deception. Therefore, I suggest that from now on, local public security bureaus should strictly manage and inspect the products of fire equipment factories, and the illegal activities of unscrupulous merchants should also be quickly dealt with by relevant departments.

    各地公安局应认真检查消防器材厂的出品
    编辑同志：我是某灭火机厂的工作人员，我要揭发消防器材业资方的罪行。制造灭火机的奸商，为了追逐暴利，竟偷工减料、粗制滥造，因而危害了国家的利益。这些粗制滥造的灭火机在出厂前都没有经过水压机的检查，所用药量也参差不一。有些奸商甚至用四氯化乙炔冒充四氯化碳，或把食盐水装到灭火机里。这种灭火机在使用时，可能因机身爆破而伤人或因腐锈失效而误事。更可恶的，这些奸商还大肆吹嘘，以达到欺骗的目的。因此，我建议：各地公安局今后应对消防器材厂的出品加以严格管理和检查试验，对奸商的非法行为，也应立刻会同有关部门迅速处理。    许白园
