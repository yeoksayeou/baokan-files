    Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau

    Serious Bureaucratic Work Style of Leading Cadres Causes Heavy Losses to the Jiulonggang Factory

    Comrade Editor: There is an intolerable bureaucracy in the leadership of the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau, which has caused serious losses to state property. Last August, the Jiulonggang Factory was ordered to move to the Southwest to participate in the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau sent Zhang Yun, the director of the Materials Department, to be responsible for the relocation of our factory. He said that the Southwest Railway had many urgent tasks, and we should move there as soon as possible. Our advance team arrived in Chongqing and discussed the housing problem with the Engineering Bureau. The various departments of the Engineering Bureau passed the buck and refused to solve the problem. The General Affairs Department knew that the guest house was empty, but they would not let us live there. Subsequently, employees and their families arrived one after another, and the deputy director of the Management Department said: "There are not enough houses to live in, find them yourselves!" Zhang Yun also did not care. Due to the lack of preparation and planning by the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau, the start of work was delayed for 47 days, and the loss of wages alone was more than 300 million yuan. More seriously, the Management Department was slow to build the machine room, and only after our urgent urging did they borrow some tarpaulins from the Materials Department to build a shed. After two or three weeks, after a few rains, the machines were rusted and the belts were moldy. I believe that the Southwest Railway Engineering Bureau should conduct an in-depth review in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

    西南铁路工程局
    领导干部官僚主义作风严重
    使九龙岗工厂受到很大损失
    编辑同志：西南铁路工程局领导方面有令人不能容忍的官僚主义，国家财产因此受到严重损失。去年八月，九龙岗工厂奉命迁到西南，参加成渝铁路的建设。西南铁路工程局派材料处处长张允负责我厂迁厂工作，他说，西南铁路有很多的急迫任务，要我们尽速迁去。我们先迁小组到了重庆，向工程局讨论住房问题。工程局各处推来推去，拒不解决问题。总务处明知招待处空着，也不给我们住。接着，职工和家属陆续到达，管理处副处长说：“房子不够住，你们自己找吧！”张允也不管。由于西南铁路工程局无准备、无计划，延迟四十七天开工，只工资一项就损失三亿多元。更严重的是管理处迟迟不搭机器房，后来被我们紧催，才从材料处借来一些帆布搭棚。经过了两、三个礼拜，下了几场雨，机器被淋得生锈，皮带也霉烂了。我认为，西南铁路工程局应在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中作深入检查。
