    Deputy Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, Tang Kai, 
    Accuses the Major Embezzler, Hang Xiaozu

    At today's meeting, I, on behalf of all employees of the Civil Aviation Administration, come to accuse Hang Xiaozu, Chief Telecommunications Engineer and Factory Director of our bureau, of embezzlement. After the liberation of Guangzhou in 1949, when the pseudo-Central Air Transport Corporation revolted in Hong Kong, Hang Xiaozu served as the Chief Telecommunications Engineer and Radio Station Director of the pseudo-"Central Aviation Corporation." During the uprising, the telecommunications staff of the pseudo-"Central Aviation Corporation" requested three months' salary, totaling HK$18,000. Of this amount, HK$500 was distributed to the staff, and the remaining HK$17,500 (equivalent to over 110 million RMB at the time) was all embezzled by Hang. In addition, a wire recorder was also embezzled by Hang Xiaozu. This behavior of Hang Xiaozu is illegal, hateful to every one of us, and should be sanctioned by national laws and disciplines.

    However, Hang Xiaozu had already made a preliminary confession of this embezzlement fact during the rectification movement in 1951 and handed over the wire recorder. After the current anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched, he went through intense ideological struggle, recognized his crimes, and took the initiative to make a thorough confession to the government and the meeting. He also guaranteed that he would never embezzle again and would hand over all the embezzled money to the state.

    Because he recognized the seriousness of his crimes, he was determined to atone for his sins. In the past year, Hang Xiaozu has been proactive and responsible in his work, completing the tasks of factory construction and equipment inventory on schedule. He has also invented communication tools that contribute to the country and continues to research new things.

    Based on the above circumstances and the people's government's policy towards embezzlers, I, on behalf of the Civil Aviation Administration, request the government to handle the case leniently, allowing him to atone for his sins and observe his future performance. (Attached picture)

    民航局副局长唐凯  
    对大贪污犯杭效祖的控诉
    在今天的大会上，我代表民航局全体员工来对我局电讯总工程师兼厂长杭效祖的贪污罪行提出控诉。一九四九年广州解放后，伪中央航空运输公司在香港起义时，杭效祖担任伪“中央航空公司”电讯总工程师兼电台主任，起义时伪“中央航空公司”的电讯工作人员要求发给三个月的薪金，共港币一万八千元。此款除已发给员工港币五百元外，其余一万七千五百元（当时折合人民币共为一亿一千余万元）全为杭所贪污。另有钢丝录音机一架也为杭效祖所贪污，杭效祖这一行为是违法的，是我们每一个人都应痛恨的，并应受到国家法纪的制裁。
    可是杭效祖这一贪污事实，在一九五一年整风时已作了初步坦白，并交出了钢丝录音机。这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动掀起以后，他经过了剧烈的思想斗争，认识到自己的罪恶，主动地向政府、向大会作了彻底的坦白，并保证今后永远不再贪污，将过去贪污的全部赃款交给国家。
    由于他认识了自己的罪恶严重，他曾抱着戴罪立功的决心。在一年以来，杭效祖工作是积极负责的，按期完成了建厂和清点器材工作任务，并发明了对国家有贡献的通讯工具，更在继续研究一些新的东西。
    根据以上情节及人民政府对于贪污分子的政策，我代表民航局要求政府从宽处理，准其戴罪立功，以观后效。（附图片）
