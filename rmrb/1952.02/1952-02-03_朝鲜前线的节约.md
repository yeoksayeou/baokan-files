    The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteers miss our great motherland every moment. Whenever they meet someone who has come to the Korean front from the motherland, everyone immediately surrounds them, asking all sorts of questions:
    “Did you go to Beijing? What new buildings have been added to the capital?”
    “Do our compatriots in the motherland know about our victories at Tiande Mountain and Maliang Mountain?”
    “How are the workers and farmers doing? What new records have been created there?”
    “Did the students receive the reply letters we wrote to them?”
    “What instructions does the people of the motherland have for us?”
    “…………………………………”
    Questions are raised one after another, everyone wants to understand everything about the motherland at once.

    This feeling of missing and loving the motherland is more concentratedly expressed in everyone's extraordinary cherishing of every bullet, every piece of clothing, and every grain of food sent from the motherland. Since Chairman Mao's great call to "increase production and practice strict economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers" reached the Korean battlefield, all the commanders and fighters of the Volunteers have become even more excited. Everyone encourages each other, saying: "Our leader cares about us so much, and our compatriots in the motherland are doing everything possible to support us, so we must cherish every item sent by the motherland doubly and give it greater power."

    There are many aspects of frugality among the Volunteer comrades. The commanders and fighters of a certain unit proposed: "If we want to do a good job in economizing, we must first practice our martial arts and improve our skills to ensure that every bullet hits the target and eliminate more enemies." Therefore, the soldiers seized every opportunity to practice their skills, whether in the cold fortifications or on the snowy frozen ground. A comrade from the ordnance section of a certain logistics department said: "Only with rich professional knowledge can we better master the business." So they actively studied ordnance knowledge and carefully studied the performance of ammunition. They carefully inspected, sorted, and assembled a large number of received and captured defective ammunition products. In half a month, they sorted out thousands of shells from the defective products. When these shells were transported to the front to strike the enemy, each shell bloomed after it was fired. In December 1951, Liu Hanzhao, the company commander of a certain unit, made such a plan: to save some ammunition as a New Year's gift to the people of the motherland. In late December, they organized three night raids by small detachments and captured thirty-six boxes of machine gun bullets, four rifles, one machine gun, and one pistol from the enemy, strengthening their firepower. The soldiers said: "Winning more battles is the biggest saving." They made plans to win more battles in 1952.

    In order to achieve victory, the soldiers were willing to endure hardships in life and overcome material difficulties. A machine gun company of a certain unit received the task of defending Kaesong and needed to build strong fortifications immediately. The fortifications were dug deep and long, requiring lights to operate in the tunnel. But there was no lamp oil. The soldiers said in unison: "It is a small matter not to eat oil, but it is a big matter to defend Kaesong, so let's use the oil we eat to light the lamps." The entire company used the oil they ate for lamps and quickly built steel-like positions.

    In fierce battles, the soldiers never easily discarded any materials. Liao Zhonghui, a soldier of a certain unit, while defending the West Peak of Gaowang Mountain, continuously defeated three enemy assaults. Enemy aircraft collapsed his fortifications, burying a machine gun and nine hundred bullets. Ignoring enemy shelling and bombing, he painstakingly dug out the weapons and ammunition. He was already injured, but still carrying the heavy machine gun and nine hundred bullets, he returned to the company headquarters along the way, clinging to branches and vines.

    When encountering enemy air raids, the Volunteer comrades always risked everything to protect and rescue materials. An engineering class of a certain unit went to a certain supply station to receive materials, just as the supply station was being bombed by enemy aircraft, and a house where the wounded were staying and filled with salt caught fire. As soon as the soldiers saw it, they shouted: "For the class brothers! For the materials sent by the motherland!" The nine people rushed into the thick smoke and flames without hesitation, first rescuing the wounded, and then rescuing thirty-eight packages of salt. Zhao Qinghua, a driver of a certain unit, had his car hit by enemy aircraft and caught fire. He thought: "This is the capital for winning battles, and it must not be burned by enemy aircraft." He jumped onto the car and put out the burning gasoline barrels. His legs were burned, but he still gritted his teeth and jumped back to the driver's seat, quickly driving the car to a safe area.

    Another important aspect of frugality for Volunteer comrades is to collect the ammunition and equipment left on the battlefield by the retreating American bandits and use waste materials to manufacture various tools and supplies. For example, Chen Zhi, a car driver of a certain unit, mobilized all the comrades in the class to collect discarded auto parts from the enemy and put together seven good cars and six complete engines in eighty days. In the process of collecting parts, sometimes they ate one less meal a day, sometimes they slept less, and some comrades' legs were swollen from running. Comrades from a certain baggage company made more than one hundred parts for large carts themselves due to the lack of tools. The soldiers of a certain logistics department picked up small pieces of scrap iron from the mountains and roadsides and forged 1,500 horseshoes. In three months, the ordnance section comrades of a certain unit pulled out 200 catties of usable iron nails from the bullet boxes. The comrades of a certain medical company's squad carried back dozens of boxes of mortar shells they picked up when passing through a forest. Wang Guisheng, a cook of a certain unit, also collected more than a dozen rows of rifle bullets and two hand grenades while delivering meals.

    The soldiers of a certain unit guarding the east bank of the Linjin River built caves in the rear of the position and established many "iron factories." They saved the charcoal for heating to supply their own "iron factories" and used collected shrapnel and scrap iron to make various tools. For example, they transformed broken gasoline barrels into rice pots, canned skins into basins, bowls, and spoons, and used shrapnel to make kitchen knives, etc. Their iron factories can also repair their own tools and weapons. For example, if the iron pickaxe becomes blunt, they will sharpen it. If there is a small problem with the guns, they can also fix it themselves. The soldiers happily said: "This is really good, so we don't have to waste transportation power by sending it back and forth." Now, as you walk through the snowy gullies on the east bank of the Linjin River, you can see the blazing furnace fire in the bunkers at any time, hear the clanging of iron, and the laughter of the soldiers.

    Our soldiers also often create many useful things with their own wisdom. For example, a telephone squad of a certain unit picked up the tail of a large enemy bomb that had not exploded, and they transformed it into a beautiful brazier. Li Shiyi, an artilleryman, transformed an American shell casing into a beautiful small stove and sent it to the front-line troops to heat food and cook dishes. Some units used the gasoline barrels dropped by the enemy to make bathtubs and established their own "position bathhouses." Inside the bunker, oil lamps were lit, and Gao Wenbin, a soldier of a certain company, used canned skins and machine gun shell casings dropped during enemy aircraft strafing to make a lamp holder and create a "bullet lamp." This new invention was quickly promoted throughout the company, saving the entire company more than two catties of soybean oil every day.

    The cooks of the Volunteers also tried their best to save the grain transported from the motherland to the front line. They studied cooking methods that produce less, or even no, pot crust. The motherland transported a large number of soybeans to the front line, and many units established "tofu workshops," "soy milk shops," "bean sprout beds," and "mills," adding many varieties to everyone's non-staple food. They also carefully studied how to make tofu better when grinding tofu. For example, the "tofu workshop" of a certain company could only make 400 pieces of tofu from 100 catties of soybeans at first. After they continuously improved their working methods, they were able to make 600 pieces of tofu from 100 catties of soybeans.

    The Volunteer comrades living in the harsh war environment are responding enthusiastically to the great motherland's call for economy with their actions.

    朝鲜前线的节约
    中国人民志愿军归国代表  夏光  庞焕洲
    志愿军的指战员们，时刻在怀念着我们伟大的祖国。每当遇到一个从祖国来到朝鲜前线的人，大家立刻围上来问长问短：
    “到了北京没有？首都添了那些新建筑？”
    “咱们在天德山、马良山打的胜仗，祖国同胞都知道了吗？”
    “工人、农民的日子过得怎样？那儿又创造了新纪录？”
    “咱们给学生们写的回信，他们收到了没有？”
    “祖国人民对咱们有什么嘱托？”
    “…………………………………”
    问题一个接一个被提出来，每个人都想一下子了解祖国的一切。
    这种怀念祖国、热爱祖国的心情，更集中地表现在大家对来自祖国的每颗子弹、每件衣服、每粒粮食的分外珍惜。自从毛主席提出的“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召传到朝鲜战场上以后，志愿军全体指战员更加兴奋。大家互相勉励说：“咱们的领袖这样关心我们，祖国同胞想尽一切办法支援我们，我们就要加倍地珍爱祖国送来的每一件东西，使它发挥更大的力量。”
    志愿军同志们节约的方面是很多的。某部的指战员们提出：“咱们要做好节约，首先就要练好武艺，提高技术，保证弹弹命中，多消灭敌人。”因此，战士们不论在冰冷的工事里或者在白雪皑皑的冻地上，一有时间就抓紧练技术。某后勤部军械科的同志说：“有了丰富的业务知识，才能更好地掌握业务。”于是他们积极学习军械知识，精心研究弹药性能。他们把大批接收的和缴获的弹药废品，细心地检查、整理和装配，半个月功夫，就从废品中整理出了数千发炮弹。这些炮弹运到阵地上打击敌人时，每个炮弹发出后都开了花。一九五一年十二月，某部连长刘汉钊订了这样一个计划：节省一些弹药作为对祖国人民的新年贺礼。十二月下旬，他们组织了三次小部队的夜袭，从敌人手里缴获过来三十六箱机枪子弹，四支步枪、一挺机枪和一支手枪，加强了自己的火力。战士们说：“多打胜仗是最大的节约。”他们纷纷订立了计划，要在一九五二年打更多的胜仗。
    为了取得胜利，战士们宁愿忍受生活上的艰苦，克服了物质上的困难。某部机枪连接受了保卫开城的任务，要立即构筑强固的工事。工事挖得又深又长，需要点灯才能在地道里操作。可是没有灯油。战士们异口同声说：“不吃油事小，保卫开城事大，就把吃的油拿来点灯吧。”全连把吃的油点了灯，迅速筑成了钢铁般的阵地。
    在激烈的战斗里，战士们绝不轻易丢弃一点物资。某部战士廖仲辉在坚守高旺山西峰时，连续打败敌人三次冲锋后，敌机炸塌了他的工事，把一挺机枪和九百发子弹埋住了。他不顾敌人的炮击和轰炸，费了很大气力把武器弹药挖了出来。他已经受伤了，仍旧背着沉重的机枪和九百发子弹，沿路攀着树枝葛藤回到了连部。
    在遭遇敌机袭击的时候，志愿军同志们总是不顾一切危险去保卫和抢救物资。某部工兵班到某兵站去接收物资，正碰上兵站被敌机轰炸，一座住有伤员和装有食盐的房子着了火。战士们一看就高喊着：“为了阶级弟兄！为了祖国送来的物资！”九个人毫不迟疑地冲进浓烟烈火中，首先把伤员抢救出来，然后又把三十八包食盐抢出。某部司机赵庆华同志的汽车被敌机打中起了火，他想：“这是打胜仗的本钱，万万不能被敌机烧掉。”他一跃身跳上汽车，扑灭了燃烧着的汽油桶。他的腿烧伤了，仍咬紧牙关跳回司机台，迅速地把汽车开到了安全地区。
    志愿军同志节约的另一个重要方面，是搜集美国强盗败退时遗留在战场上的弹药器材和利用废物来制造各种工具用品。例如某部汽车司机陈智，动员全班同志搜集敌人遗弃下的废汽车零件，在八十天中拼成了七部好汽车和六部完整的引擎。在搜集零件中，有时他们一天少吃一顿饭，有时少睡觉，有的同志腿都跑肿了。某部辎重连的同志，在工具缺乏的情况下，自己动手制造了一百多辆大车的零件。某部后勤处的战士们，从山上、公路旁拣起一小块一小块的废铁，打造了马掌一千五百副。某部军械科同志在三个月里，从子弹箱上拔下了可用的铁钉二百斤。某救护连的一班同志，路过一个森林时，扛回了拾到的几十箱迫击炮弹。某部炊事员王桂生，在送饭途中也收集了十几排步枪子弹和两颗手榴弹。
    守卫在临津江东岸的某部战士，在阵地后方打造地洞，成立了许多“铁工厂”。他们把烤火的炭省下来供给自己的“铁工厂”用，利用收集来的弹片、废铁打造各种工具。例如他们把破汽油桶改造成饭锅，把罐头皮改造成盆碗和杓子，用弹片打造菜刀等等。他们的铁工厂还能修理自己的工具和武器。比如，铁镐使秃了，就去打尖。枪械有了小毛病，也可以自己把它修好。战士们高兴地说：“这真好，免得送来送去浪费运输力。”现在，你走过临津江东岸铺满白雪的山沟里，随时可以看到掩蔽部里的熊熊的炉火，听到叮叮噹噹的打铁声，和战士们的欢笑声。
    我们的战士们还时常以自己的智慧创造许多有用的东西。例如某部电话班拣到了一个没有炸的敌人的大炸弹弹尾，他们就把他改造成一个漂亮的火盆。炮兵李世义把一枚美式炮弹壳改装成一个美丽的小火炉，送给前沿部队热饭、烧菜。有些单位，利用敌人丢下的汽油桶做澡盆，建立了自己的“阵地澡堂”。掩蔽部里面点油灯，某连战士高文斌就利用罐头皮和敌机扫射时落下的机枪弹壳，制成灯头，造出一种“子弹灯”。这个新发明很快就推广到全连，使全连每天可以节省两斤多豆油。
    志愿军的炊事员们还尽量节省祖国运到前线的粮食，他们研究了少出锅巴、甚至不出锅巴的煮饭方法。祖国运到前线大批黄豆，许多单位就成立了“豆腐房”“豆浆馆”“豆芽菜床”“磨坊”等，使大家的副食中增添了许多花样。他们在磨豆腐时也细心钻研怎样做得更好。例如某连的“豆腐房”起初一百斤黄豆只能做四百块豆腐，经过他们连续改进工作方法，结果使一百斤黄豆能做豆腐六百块。
    在战争环境中生活艰苦的志愿军同志们，就是这样以自己的行动，热烈响应伟大祖国节约的号召。
