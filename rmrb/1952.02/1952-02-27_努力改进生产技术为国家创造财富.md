Workers Wang Fengshan and others from Shanxi Kiln General Factory
　　Improved Operation Methods Create New Kiln Firing Record
　　Editor: The labor models Wang Fengshan, Li Wenke, Wu Puniu, etc., from the First and Third Branches of the Taiyuan Public Shanxi Kiln General Factory, improved kiln firing technology and set a new city record in July last year with an average kiln time of six and a half days and a coal consumption of twelve tons.
　　After the democratic reform and patriotic labor emulation movement, the workers' political awareness at the factory significantly improved. Wang Fengshan and the other two were determined to study technology and improve kiln firing methods. They changed the distance of the kiln bed from the ground, saving a lot of fuel. Before firing the kiln, they checked whether the fire channels were clear and whether the brick blanks were evenly dry. In the past, it took eleven days to fire a kiln, but now it has been shortened to six and a half days; in the past, it took fifteen tons of coal to fire a kiln, but now it has been reduced to twelve tons; the rejection rate has been reduced from ten percent to four percent. In the past, the color of the bricks was not correct, but now all the bricks are uniformly blue-green and sound clear. After improving their kiln firing technology, they have increased the value of wealth for the country by more than 100,000 jin of millet. Wang Shijun

Liaoxi Victory Factory Labor Model
　　Liu Changsheng Successfully Uses Wine Lees to Make Wine
　　Editor: Liu Changsheng, a labor model at the Liaoxi Siping Victory Factory, successfully used wine lees to make wine. In China's old method of winemaking, when the alcohol concentration of the wine flowing out of the pot is below 20%, it is considered waste and called wine lees. Last April, Liu Changsheng conducted an experiment and found that the wine lees contained 20% alcohol. He suggested: if we burn the wine lees again, we will definitely get wine with a higher concentration. When the workers heard this, they all said, "Any trade can invent and create, but there is nothing new in the winemaking business." He had to put the matter aside temporarily. As soon as the production increase and economy practice movement started in the factory, he suggested it again to the leadership. Encouraged by the leading cadres, he collected the wine lees with a concentration below 20% and put them in large buckets. After collecting more than 1,300 jin, he steamed it during his spare time from winemaking. As a result, he indeed produced 400 jin of wine with a concentration above 50%. Both experiments yielded the same results, and the taste of the wine was exactly the same as ordinary wine. The experiment was finally successful, and the workers' conservative thinking was also broken. Organized and led by the Liaoxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, all 27 single-pot distilleries and 104 teams in the province have fully promoted this advanced experience. Based on the daily wine production figures of the province, the monthly increase in production is 63,400 jin of wine, equivalent to 387 tons of grain. Xia Jiqiu

Dezhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Grain Bureau and Dezhou Grain Branch Company
　　Strengthening Work Contacts Saves a Large Amount of Wealth
　　Editor: The Dezhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office of the Grain Bureau and the Dezhou Branch of the China National Grain Corporation in Shandong Province, in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, thoroughly examined past work, corrected departmentalism, strengthened contacts between departments, improved work, and saved a large amount of wealth for the country.
　　In the past, the Dezhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office of the Grain Bureau and the Dezhou Branch of the China National Grain Corporation both had serious departmentalism, which caused many unnecessary wastes. For example, once the Prefectural Commissioner's Office of the Grain Bureau transferred one million jin of soybeans to Xuzhou, while the Dezhou Grain Branch Company transferred one million jin of soybeans from Xuzhou. They could have been allocated to each other, but because the two units did not communicate, a lot of freight was wasted. After this review, both parties established close contact in their work, and if an allocation was possible, they would strive to do so. Therefore, in the recent two allocations of wheat, they saved more than 700 million yuan in freight. I think this method of practicing economy by improving working relationships is worth emulating in various places. Liu Hao

China National Cotton Yarn and Fabric Corporation Northwest District Company
　　Improved Transportation and Management
　　Increased Production and Savings Reached 6.3 Billion Yuan
　　Editor: All employees of the units under the China National Cotton Yarn and Fabric Corporation Northwest District Company, through work competitions and the production increase and economy practice movement, improved transportation and management, and in the fourth quarter of 1951, increased production and saved more than 6.34 billion yuan for the country. In the past, when the company purchased cotton in Huayin, Tongguan, Sanyuan, and other places for external transfer, it was first transported to Xian and Wei to be made into iron-packed bales before being transported to East China. However, after everyone's research, it was decided that the cotton transferred from the above-mentioned places would be packed into wooden bales locally and directly transported to East China. This saved a total of more than 2.85 billion yuan in repacking, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses. At the same time, in order to strengthen the planning of transportation and strive for goods to be transported as soon as they arrived without being stored in warehouses, the method of local allocation of goods was adopted to reduce transportation costs. For example, when transporting cotton in October and November last year, this method was adopted, saving more than 350 million yuan in transportation and miscellaneous expenses. In addition, changing transportation tools (such as changing from trucks to horse-drawn carriages for transportation from Xi'an to Lanzhou), appropriately increasing the weight of cotton bales, paying attention to the use of waste materials, rationally using funds, implementing fixed quotas for cash inventory and commodity inventory, and accelerating capital turnover also saved a large amount of wealth for the country.

    努力改进生产技术为国家创造财富
    山西窑业总厂工人王凤山等
    改进操作方法创烧窑新纪录
    编辑同志：太原市公营山西窑业总厂第一、第三分厂的劳动模范王凤山、李文科、吴濮牛等，改进了烧窑技术，在去年七月以每窑平均需时六天半、用煤十二吨的成绩，创全市烧窑的新纪录。
    经过了民主改革和爱国主义劳动竞赛运动，该厂工人的政治觉悟显著提高。王凤山等三人决心钻研技术，改进烧窑方法。他们改变了窑床离地的距离，节省了许多燃料。在未烧窑之前，他们检查火道是否通顺，砖坯是否均匀干燥。过去烧成一窑需十一天，现在缩短到六天半；过去烧一窑需煤十五吨，现在减少到十二吨；废品率由百分之十减到百分之四。过去砖的颜色不正，现在所有的砖青蓝一致，声音响亮。他们改进烧窑技术后，已给国家增加财富价值十万多斤小米。王士俊
    辽西胜利工厂劳动模范
    刘长胜利用酒稍子制酒成功
    编辑同志：辽西四平市胜利工厂劳动模范刘长胜利用酒稍子制酒成功。我国旧法制酒，当锅内流出的酒的浓度在百分之二十以下，即认为是废物，称它为酒稍子。去年四月，刘长胜作过一次试验，发现酒稍子里含有百分之二十的酒。他提议：把酒稍子再烧一遍，一定可出浓度较高的酒。工人们听了，都说：“那个行道都能发明创造，烧酒这行可没有什么新花样。”他只好把这件事暂时放下。增产节约运动在该厂一展开，他就再向领导方面建议。在领导干部鼓励下，他把二十度以下的酒稍子接下来，另用大桶装起。接到一千三百多斤，他就利用烧酒的空隙时间蒸了一下。结果，果然出了四百斤五十度以上的酒。两次试验都收到同样效果，酒的味道和普通的酒完全相同。试验终于成功了，工人们的保守思想也被打破了。经过辽西省总工会的组织和领导，全省二十七个单烧锅，一百零四个班已经全部推广这一个先进经验。以全省每天出酒数字计算，每月可增产六万三千四百斤酒，折合粮食三百八十七吨。  夏继秋
    德州专署粮食局和德州粮食分公司
    加强工作联系节省大量财富
    编辑同志：山东省德州专署粮食局和中国粮食公司德州分公司，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，深入检查过去工作，纠正了本位主义思想，加强了各部门的联系，改进了工作，替国家节省了大笔财富。
    过去德州专署粮食局和中国粮食公司德州分公司，都有严重的本位主义作风，以致造成很多不应有的浪费。如有一次专署粮食局调往徐州一百万斤豆子，而德州粮食分公司又从徐州调进一百万斤豆子，本来可以对拨，但因为两个单位没有联系，以致浪费了很多运费。经过这次检查，双方在工作上取得密切联系，能够对拨的一定争取对拨，因此在最近两次对拨小麦时，就节省了运费七亿多元。我认为这种从改善工作关系来厉行节约的方法，是值得各地效法的。    刘    浩
    中国花纱布公司西北区公司
    改善了运输和经营管理
    增产节约达六十三亿元
    编辑同志：中国花纱布公司西北区公司所属各单位全体职工，通过工作竞赛和增产节约运动，改善了运输和经营管理，在一九五一年第四季度，共为国家增产节约六十三亿四千多万元。过去该公司在华阴、潼关、三原等地收购棉花外调时，是先运到咸、渭两地打成铁机包后再运华东，但经过大家研究，决定以上各地外调棉花，都就地改打木机棉包，直接运往华东。这样共节约了改包、运、杂等费二十八亿五千多万元。同时为了加强运输的计划性，争取货物随到随运，不落仓库，又采取商品就地调拨办法，减免调运费用。如去年十、十一两月份运输棉花时，采取了这一办法，共节省了运杂费三亿五千多万元。此外改换运输工具（如西安到兰州由汽车改用马车运输），适当加重棉包重量，注意利用废料，合理使用资金，实行现金库存定额和商品库存定额制度，加速了资金周转，也为国家节约了大笔财富。
