    Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch: In December of last year and January of this year, most areas of the country experienced little rainfall or snowfall, and a winter drought has formed in the North China region. In January, Beijing, Gui Sui, Baoding, Taiyuan and other places did not have any snow. The precipitation (rain and snow) in Taiyuan was 5.1 millimeters less than in the same period of previous years. In the Northwest, snowfall in January was also less than in previous years. Most areas of Northeast China had significant snowfall last winter and this spring. However, in Songjiang and Jilin provinces, snowfall was limited in December of last year, and in the Liaodong area, snowfall was limited in January. The East China region generally feels a lack of rain and snow. In December of last year, only a few areas in Southern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, and Northern Zhejiang had more rain and snow than in previous years. Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Fujian, and most areas of Zhejiang had less rain and snow than in previous years. The situation in the northern part of Central South China was normal, while the central part was abundant; in the southern parts of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, rainfall was halved in the two months compared to previous years. Guangzhou's rainfall in December was 19.3 millimeters less than in previous years, and its rainfall in January was 37.5 millimeters less than in previous years. In the Southwest, Yunnan and the southern part of Guizhou do not lack rain, but Sichuan and Xikang provinces are generally lacking rain. In December of last year and January of this year, only the Northeast and the central part of Central South China had relatively sufficient rainfall and snowfall. The rainfall and snowfall in the Northwest were about the same as in previous years, while other regions had less rainfall and snowfall than in previous years. The decision of the State Council of the Central People's Government on vigorously launching a mass drought prevention and drought resistance campaign has aroused nationwide attention to drought prevention and drought resistance. This movement, as spring plowing approaches, will be universally launched throughout the country.

    【新华社十七日讯】去年十二月和今年一月，全国大部地区降雨、降雪不多，华北区已形成冬旱。一月份，北京、归绥、保定、太原等地都没有下过雪；太原比往年同一时期的降水量（雨和雪）相差五点一公厘。西北各地一月份下雪都比往年少。东北大部地区去冬今春的雪都不少。但是，松江、吉林两省去年十二月份下雪不多，辽东地区一月份下雪也不多。华东区普遍感到雨雪不足，去年十二月份只有苏南、皖南和浙江北部少数地区雨雪量比往年多些，山东、苏北、皖北、福建和浙江大部地区雨雪量均比往年少。中南区北部平常，中部丰润；广东和广西两省的南部，两个月间降雨量比往年少了一半。广州十二月份的雨量比往年少十九点三公厘，一月份的雨量比往年少三十七点五公厘。西南区云南和贵州南部地区不缺雨，但是四川地区和西康省普遍缺雨。去年十二月和今年一月，只有东北区和中南区中部地区雨雪量较为充足，西北各地的雨雪量和往年差不多，其他地区雨雪量都比往年少。中央人民政府政务院关于大力开展群众性防旱抗旱运动的决定公布后，已引起全国对防旱和抗旱的注意，这个运动，随着春耕迫近，将要在全国普遍展开。
