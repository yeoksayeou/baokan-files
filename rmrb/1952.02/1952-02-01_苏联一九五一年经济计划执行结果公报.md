Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th (TASS): The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union has issued the following communiqué on the results of the implementation of the national economic development plan for 1951:

　　The development of industry, agriculture and transportation, capital construction projects, the expansion of trade, and the improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the people in 1951 can be seen from the following materials:

　　I. Implementation of the Industrial Production Plan

　　The total industrial output plan for the entire year of 1951 was completed by 103.5 percent overall. The implementation of the annual total industrial output plan by various departments is as follows (percentage of completion of the 1951 annual plan):

　　In 1951, the production of several items of ferrous metals, several non-ferrous metals, iron, iron pipes, coal, coking coal, oil, natural gas, gasoline, naphtha, diesel oil, peat, electricity, electric motors, electric vacuum devices, metal cutting machine tools, spinning machines, weaving machines, woolen spinning machines, tractors, grain harvesting combines, hemp harvesting combines, complex threshing machines, hemp pulling machines, tree planting machines, trucks and automobiles, buses, mainline locomotives, diesel locomotives, excavators, graders, road rollers, electric road rollers, truck-mounted cranes, automatic loaders, ball bearings, synthetic rubber, automobile tires, synthetic ammonia, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, mineral fertilizers, chemicals for eliminating agricultural pests and weeds, dyes and other chemicals, roofing felt, roofing slate, window glass, paper, alcohol and many other industrial products exceeded the plan.

　　The government's task of producing more industrial products and food than specified in the prescribed annual plan has been overfulfilled. In 1951, large quantities of cotton fabrics, woolen fabrics, silk fabrics, clothing, knitwear, rubber shoes, sewing machines, clocks, cameras, sausages, condensed milk, cheese, vegetable oil, sugar, confectionery, canned food, macaroni, tea, wine, champagne, beer, soap, cigarettes, matches and many other civilian goods were produced in excess of the plan.

　　The annual plan for total industrial output and the output of most important industrial products has been completed and exceeded in terms of variety, but some departments have not completed the plan in certain items. Individual enterprises have exceeded the total output plan by increasing the production of minor items, but have not completed the production plan for the items specified in the state plan.

　　In 1951, there was further improvement in the quality of industrial products and further increase in variety. However, not all industrial sectors have fully completed the tasks stipulated in the state plan in terms of producing and supplying certain manufactured goods according to the prescribed variety and quality. For example, the Ministry of the Iron and Steel Industry did not fully complete the production plan for certain rolled ferrous metals, the Ministry of Heavy Machine Building did not complete the production plan for steam boilers and steam turbines, the Ministry of Machine and Instrument Manufacturing did not complete the production plan for certain types of chemical equipment, presses and computers, the Ministry of Agricultural Machine Building did not complete the production plan for tractor-drawn seed drills, grain cleaning machines, sorting machines and certain other agricultural machines, the Ministry of Building Materials Industry of the Soviet Union did not complete the production plan for certain types of concrete, and the Ministry of Timber Industry of the Soviet Union did not complete the plan for transporting major types of timber.

　　II. Increase in Industrial Output

　　The increase in the production of important industrial products in 1951 compared to 1950 is as follows (percentage of 1951 compared to 1950):

　　Pig iron 114, steel 115, rolled metal 115, iron pipes 114, copper 114, lead 125, zinc 115, coal 108, oil 112, natural gas 108, gasoline 120, kerosene 103, diesel oil 145, electricity 114, steam turbines 110, large-scale hydro turbines 245, turbine generators 211, hydro generators 193, large-scale electrical machines 137, electric motors 124, electric light bulbs 120, large, heavy and super machine tools 111, chemical equipment 138, agricultural machines 115, tractor-drawn seed drills 115, tractor-drawn cultivators 117, grain harvesting combines 115, mainline electric locomotives 111, buses 134, motorcycles 102, excavators 105, computers 201, ball bearings 130, soda ash 109, caustic soda 108, dyes 115, mineral fertilizers 107, chemicals for eliminating agricultural pests and weeds 185, synthetic rubber 120, concrete 119, bricks 120, roofing felt 113, roofing slate 127, prefabricated houses 116, timber 117, paper 112, bicycles 178, sewing machines 133, clocks 127, cameras 137, radios 116, gramophones 124, pianos and grand pianos 121, cotton fiber 133, cotton fabrics 122, linen fabrics 111, woolen fabrics 113, silk fabrics 134, knitwear 126, leather shoes 117, rubber shoes 111, fish products 122, meat 112, sausages 117, butter 106, dairy products 144, condensed milk 144, cheese 120, vegetable oil 112, confectionery 116, sugar 118, alcohol 111, wine 124, champagne 121, beer 116, canned food 118, matches 106, cigarettes 113, tea 131.

　　The total output of Soviet industry in 1951 increased by 16 percent compared to 1950.

　　According to the state supply plan, the Soviet national economy received more raw materials, materials, fuel, electricity and equipment in the past year than in 1950.

　　In 1951, further improvements continued to be made in the utilization of industrial equipment. In the iron and steel industry, the effective volume of blast furnace use increased by more than 5 percent in the past year compared to 1950. The amount of steel produced per square meter of blast furnace increased by almost 5 percent. The speed of oil drilling in enterprises of the Ministry of Oil Industry has increased. The percentage of light oil obtained in refineries has increased. In enterprises of the Ministry of Coal Industry, the productivity of coal mining combines increased by 19 percent in the past year. Factories under the Ministry of Chemical Industry have made improvements in the utilization of the production capacity of synthetic rubber and synthetic ammonia; the cotton textile industry and the concrete industry have also made improvements in the utilization of equipment.

　　The consumption of raw materials, materials, fuel and electricity per unit of output in 1951 was lower than in 1950, and many industries were lower than the planned quota. The 1951 plan to reduce the cost of industrial products has been overfulfilled. The funds saved in 1951 due to the reduction in the cost of industrial production amounted to more than 26 billion rubles, not including the money saved due to the reduction in the wholesale prices of raw materials and materials. Based on the achievements made in 1951 in the development of industry and transportation, in increasing labor productivity, and in reducing production costs, the government has further reduced the wholesale prices of hardware, machinery and equipment, fuel, chemicals, building materials and paper, and reduced the cost of electricity, heat and railway freight from January 1, 1952.

　　III. Application of New Technologies in the National Economy

　　In 1951, further achievements were made in mastering the use of new machines, equipment and materials.

　　The Soviet machine-building industry invented approximately 500 very important new types of machines and equipment in 1951, ensuring greater technological progress in the national economy.

　　New powerful steam turbines and high-pressure boilers, hydro turbines and hydro generators, air switches, high-voltage circuit breakers and lightning arresters for long-distance power transmission have been invented.

　　In the construction of large-scale hydroelectric equipment, powerful suction dredgers and dredgers, efficient single-bucket and multi-bucket excavators, powerful concrete mixers and 25-ton trucks for automatic concrete plants have been manufactured to mechanize laborious operations.

　　The machine tool industry has refined nearly 150 new high-efficiency metal-cutting machine tools, forging and die-casting machines, and a large number of new hard alloy mechanical tools.

　　Many new types of equipment have been manufactured in the petroleum industry, chemical industry, light industry, food industry and other industries and transportation.

　　In order to further mechanize farmland work, various new machines and implements have been manufactured for plowing, planting, harvesting grain, industrial crops and vegetables, and processing them. In addition, many new machines have been manufactured to mechanize the work of equipping feed and to plant shelterbelts.

　　The level of mechanization in various sectors of the national economy has been greatly improved.

　　In the coal mining industry, the mechanization of coal cutting, coal drilling, coal transportation and underground transportation methods was completed as early as 1950. In 1951, the use of new combined machines in the excavation of thin coal seams and steep slope coal seams began, thereby enabling the improvement of the level of mechanization of coal loading work. More than 1,500 combined machines and coal cutting machines and 1,350 continuous production units have been remotely controlled.

　　In the enterprises of the Ministry of Timber Industry of the Soviet Union, the volume of mechanized logging and timber transportation work increased by 1.7 times compared to 1950, the volume of mechanized timber loading work increased by 2.2 times, and the volume of mechanized timber dragging work increased by 1.2 times.

　　In 1951, new high-efficiency technological methods continued to be implemented in various sectors of the national economy, and the work of further mechanizing production was carried out.

　　In the factories of the Ministry of the Iron and Steel Industry, 87 percent of all steel production was melted in open-hearth furnaces equipped with automatic temperature regulators. The production volume of specially shaped rolled metal has also increased, thereby greatly reducing consumption during further processing of metals.

　　In the non-ferrous metals industry, new methods and perfect technologies of condensation and comprehensive smelting of mineral concentrates and slurries have been adopted, which helps to fully refine non-ferrous metals and rare metals.

　　In the petroleum industry, the use of turbine-type drilling machines has been expanded. Oil production using the method of maintaining formation pressure has been further developed. New technological methods of oil refining using Soviet-made machines have been adopted, which can increase the production of oil and improve their quality.

　　In machine manufacturing, the advanced methods of metal refining—high-speed cutting, new electrical methods and thermal methods of processing metal—are further used.

　　Automatic and semi-automatic devices have been used to control the dimensions of mass-produced parts.

　　Work on the extensive automation of hydroelectric power stations and the automation of the heating process in power station boiler rooms is underway. More than 90 percent of local hydroelectric power stations have automated work units.

　　Nearly 700,000 innovations and rationalization proposals planned by workers and mechanical technicians to improve and fundamentally improve the production process were adopted in 1951.

　　IV. Agriculture

　　In 1951, socialist agriculture achieved new successes in the development of cultivation and livestock breeding, and in the organization and economic consolidation of collective farms. According to statistics from the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, despite the climatic imbalance in the Volga River Basin, Western Siberia, the Kazakh Republic and several other regions, the total grain harvest in 1951 reached 7.4 billion poods. The harvest of grain—wheat and rye—was higher than in 1950. The total harvest of unginned cotton was more than in 1950 and higher than in previous years. The sugar beet harvest exceeded that of 1950 by 27 million tons.

　　In 1951, the sown area of various crops was 6.7 million hectares more than in 1950. The area planted with cotton, sugar beet, sunflower and other industrial crops has been expanded. The sown area of perennial and annual grasses, fodder, root crops and underground crops has been greatly increased.

　　The collective farms and state farms have successfully completed the plan for sowing winter crops to obtain a bumper harvest in 1952. The area of land plowed last autumn in preparation for the spring sowing in 1952 exceeded the area cultivated in the autumn of 1950 by 5.4 million hectares.

　　The technological foundation of agriculture in 1951 will be even more solid.

　　Last year, agriculture obtained 137,000 tractors (in 15-horsepower units), 53,000 grain harvesting combines (including 29,000 self-propelled harvesters), 59,000 trucks, and 2 million plowing, sowing, harvesting and other agricultural machines.

　　The increase in technical equipment in agriculture has further mechanized agricultural work on collective farms and state farms. The work completed by collective farm machine tractor stations in 1951 increased by 19 percent compared to 1950. Last year, machine tractor stations completed more than two-thirds of all field work on collective farms. All cultivation work and three-quarters of sowing work on collective farms have been mechanized; more than 60 percent of all grain areas on collective farms have been harvested by harvesting combines. On state farms, almost all major agricultural work has been mechanized.

　　Along with the mechanization of agricultural work, a lot of work has also been completed in agricultural electrification. In 1951, the electricity used in collective farms for processing grain, preparing feed, supplying water, milking cows and shearing sheep has been greatly increased.

　　In 1951, the number of livestock owned by collective farms and state farms continued to increase. Livestock breeding on collective farms and livestock breeding on state farms occupy the main position in all livestock breeding.

　　The percentage increase in the number of livestock owned by collective farms in 1951 is as follows: cattle and dairy cows 12 percent (cows 15 percent), pigs 26 percent, goats and sheep 8 percent, horses 8 percent. The number of poultry on collective farms has increased by one and a half times.

　　Last year, the number of livestock increased in the state farms belonging to the Ministry of State Farms of the Soviet Union as follows: cattle and dairy cows 15 percent (cows 14 percent), pigs 21 percent, goats and sheep 11 percent, horses 14 percent, poultry 27 percent.

　　In 1951, the total number of livestock on collective farms, state farms, collective farmers and employees increased by nearly 14 million, including more than 1.6 million cattle and dairy cows, 2.6 million pigs, 8.5 million goats and sheep, and nearly 1 million horses. During this year, the number of poultry increased by more than 60 million.

　　In 1951, collective farms, forest farms, machine tractor stations and afforestation stations, and state farms in the grassland and forest-grassland areas of the European part of the Soviet Union planted a total of 745,000 hectares of shelterbelts.

　　V. Development of Railway, Waterway and Automobile Transportation

　　The railway transportation plan for 1951 has been overfulfilled, increasing by 12 percent compared to 1950. The overall plan for average daily loading volume exceeded by 3 percent.

　　The task of accelerating the freight car turnover rate stipulated in the national plan for 1951 has been overfulfilled. Fuel consumption per ton-kilometer of railway transportation decreased by 3 percent compared to 1950. However, the plan to improve railway utilization has not been fully completed.

　　The inland river freight transportation plan for 1951 was completed by 100.6 percent, and the freight volume increased by 13 percent compared to 1950.

　　The sea freight transportation plan for 1951 was completed by 102 percent, and the freight volume increased by 8 percent compared to 1950.

　　The volume of automobile freight increased by 20 percent compared to 1950.

　　VI. Increase in Investment in the National Economy

　　Extensive construction plans were completed in 1951. The national investment in the past year was 112 percent of that in 1950. The investment in power station construction projects was 140 percent of that in 1950, 120 percent for the iron and steel and non-ferrous metals industries, 112 percent for the coal and petroleum industries, 110 percent for the machine manufacturing industry, 135 percent for the building materials industry, 106 percent for machine tractor stations and state farms, 103 percent for the transportation industry, and 120 percent for housing construction.

　　The tasks stipulated for the construction of huge hydraulic projects on the Volga River, the Don River and the Dnieper River, and for the excavation of the Turkmen Main Canal in 1951 have been successfully completed.

　　In 1951, construction agencies obtained a large number of highly productive machines and equipment. The total number of existing excavators has increased by approximately 40 percent compared to 1950, bulldozers have increased by more than 30 percent, road rollers have increased by more than 80 percent, and other construction machines and equipment have also increased significantly. The comprehensive mechanization of construction engineering is becoming increasingly common on various construction sites. The supply of building materials has improved.

　　In 1951, construction agencies reduced construction costs compared to 1950, and the time required for construction projects was also shortened compared to 1950. However, many construction agencies have not been able to fully achieve the national goal of reducing construction costs.

　　State-owned enterprises, institutions and local Soviets, as well as residents of various cities and workers' residential areas, built new houses with a total floor area of 27 million square meters with state loans. In addition, approximately 400,000 houses were built in rural areas.

　　VII. Expansion of Trade

　　In 1951, Soviet trade continued to expand. Due to the new achievements made in 1950 in the development of industry and agriculture, in improving labor productivity, and in reducing production costs, the government once again implemented the fourth reduction in the prices of general consumer goods since the abolition of the rationing system from March 1, 1951. As a result of this price reduction, the Soviet ruble has become more stable, its purchasing power has increased, and the volume of goods sold to the people has been further increased.

　　In 1951, the volume of goods sold to the people by state-owned stores and cooperatives (calculated at comparable prices) increased by 15 percent compared to 1950. The sales volume of individual items increased as follows: meat 32 percent, sausages 29 percent, fish products 14 percent, butter 10 percent, vegetable oil 40 percent, milk and dairy products 35 percent, eggs 20 percent, sugar 29 percent, confectionery 13 percent, tea 29 percent, fruit 33 percent, cotton fabrics 18 percent, silk fabrics 26 percent, clothing 14 percent, leather shoes 11 percent, furniture 50 percent, civil building materials 45 percent, household soap and laundry soap 13 percent, radios 26 percent, clocks 15 percent, sewing machines 29 percent, cameras 38 percent, bicycles 86 percent. The sales volume of refrigerators, washing machines and vacuum cleaners has increased several times.

　　The state-owned trade and cooperative trade network has expanded. Approximately 8,000 new stores opened in 1951.

　　In 1951, the sales volume of agricultural products sold to the people in the collective farm market, especially the sales volume of flour, cereals, lard, poultry, eggs, fruits and honey, increased significantly compared to 1950.

　　VIII. Increase in the Number of Employees and Improvement in Labor Productivity

　　At the end of 1951, the number of employees in the Soviet national economy reached 40.8 million, an increase of 1.6 million compared to the end of 1950. The number of employees in industry and agriculture and forestry, construction and transportation increased by 1.25 million, the number of employees in educational institutions, scientific research institutions and medical institutions increased by approximately 25,000, and the number of employees in trade and housing and public utilities increased by more than 100,000.

　　In 1951, as in previous years, there were no unemployed people in the country.

　　Last year, 365,000 young people graduated from trade schools, railway schools, mining schools and factory apprentice schools and became skilled workers, and have been employed in industry, construction and transportation.

　　Seven million employees have learned skills or improved their skills by virtue of amateur individual or collective education, or by attending amateur training courses.

　　The labor productivity of industrial workers increased by 10 percent in 1951 compared to 1950, including an increase of 14 percent in the machine manufacturing industry, 9 percent in the iron and steel industry, 6 percent in the non-ferrous metal smelting industry, 8 percent in the coal mining industry, 9 percent in the petroleum industry, 9 percent in the chemical industry, and 9.5 percent in the construction industry.

　　IX. Cultural Development, Public Health and Improvement of Municipal Construction

　　In 1951, further achievements were made in all aspects of socialist culture.

　　Last year, the number of people studying in the Soviet Union (including various forms of study) reached 57 million.

　　The number of seven-year schools and secondary schools increased by approximately 5,000 in one year. The number of students in grades five to ten in these schools increased by 2.5 million.

　　In 1951, the total number of students in 887 higher education institutions (including correspondence classes) was 1,356,000, an increase of 100,800 compared to 1950. The total number of students in 3,543 technical schools and other specialized secondary schools (including correspondence classes) was 1,384,000, an increase of 86,000 compared to 1950.

　　In 1951, higher education institutions trained 201,000 young experts, and technical schools trained 262,000 young experts.

　　The number of graduates from higher education institutions and technical schools who served as experts in various sectors of the national economy increased by 8 percent in 1951 compared to 1950.

　　In 1951, more than 24,000 people continued their studies in higher education institutions and scientific research institutes.

　　In 1951, 2,694 scientists, engineers, agricultural experts, writers and artists, workers and advanced agricultural workers were awarded the Stalin Prize for their outstanding achievements in science, invention, literature and art.

　　In 1951, there were more than 350,000 libraries of various types maintained by state agencies and public organizations across the country, with more than 700 million books.

　　In 1951, the number of film projectors increased by 4,000 compared to the previous year. In 1951, the number of theater and cinema audiences increased by 12 percent compared to 1950.

　　In the summer of 1951, more than 5 million children and teenagers lived in Young Pioneer camps, children's sanatoriums, or participated in hiking teams and sightseeing groups, or were taken to the countryside in an organized manner by kindergartens, children's homes and nurseries to spend the entire summer.

　　The network of hospitals, maternity hospitals, pharmacies and other health agencies, as well as sanatoriums and rest homes, was further expanded in 1951. The number of beds in hospitals and maternity hospitals increased by almost 50,000 compared to 1950. The number of beds in sanatoriums and rest homes increased by 18,000. The number of physicians in 1951 increased by 6 percent compared to 1950.

　　The production of medicines, medical devices and equipment increased by 36 percent compared to 1950, which can fundamentally improve the work of supplying and equipping medical agencies with medicines, the latest equipment, laboratory equipment and medical devices.

　　In 1951, as in previous years, a lot of work was also completed to construct public utilities, improve cities and workers' residential areas, lay water pipes and sewers, extend tramways and trolleybus lines, supply more houses with gas and hot air, open up grasslands, pave stone roads and asphalt roads in urban areas and squares, and arrange parks, public gardens and boulevards.

　　X. Increase in National Income and Personal Income

　　In 1951, the national income of the Soviet Union (calculated at comparable prices) increased by 12 percent compared to 1950.

　　In the Soviet Union, all national income belongs to the working people. As in the previous year, the working people of the Soviet Union received approximately three-quarters of the national income to meet their personal material and cultural needs, while the remaining part of the national income was disposed of by the state, collective farms and cooperative organizations in order to expand socialist production and meet the other needs of the entire country and society.

　　Due to the increase in national income, the material living conditions of workers, peasants and intellectuals can be significantly improved, and socialist production in urban and rural areas can be ensured to be further expanded.

　　The improvement in the material living conditions of the Soviet people is manifested in the increase in the nominal and actual wages of employees, and in the increase in the income of peasants from collectively managed collective farming, as well as from their family gardens and personal sidelines.

　　In addition, in 1951, as in previous years, the people also received various benefits from state-provided subsidies, namely: receiving various allowances and subsidies from the employee social insurance fund, receiving pensions from the social support fund, free or low-cost entry into sanatoriums, rest homes and children's educational institutions, allowances for mothers with many children and single mothers, free medical care, free education and vocational and professional training, scholarships and many other rewards and benefits. Not only that, all employees, that is, approximately 41 million people, spent at least two weeks on vacation with pay, and workers in some industries have even longer vacations. In 1951, the total value of these rewards and benefits enjoyed by the people from state subsidies reached 125 billion rubles.

　　Due to the reduction in consumer goods prices, due to the increase in the nominal wages of employees, due to the increase in the cash and in-kind income of peasants, and due to the increase in the rewards and benefits obtained by the people from state subsidies—in 1951, the income of employees and the income of peasants (calculated at comparable prices) increased by 10 percent compared to 1950.

    一九五一年苏联全部工业的总产量较一九五○年增加百分之十六。
    按照国家供应计划，过去一年的苏联国民经济较一九五○年得到更多的原料、物资、燃料、电力和装备。
    一九五一年工业方面在利用工业设备上继续获得进一步的改进。在钢铁工业中，过去一年鼓风炉有效量的使用较一九五○年增加百分之五以上。每平方公尺鼓风炉的产钢量差不多增加了百分之五。石油工业部各企业采油钻井的速度已经增加。炼油所获得的轻油部分所占百分比已经提高。煤矿工业部各企业中，过去一年采煤联合机的生产率增加了百分之十九。化学工业部所属各工厂在利用人造橡胶和人造阿摩尼亚的生产能力方面，棉织工业和混凝土工业在利用设备方面都已有了改进。
    一九五一年每一产量单位所需的原料、材料、燃料与电力的耗费量较一九五○年低，有许多工业比计划规定的定量还低。一九五一年关于减低工业产品生产成本的计划已经超额完成。一九五一年由于减低工业生产成本而节省下来的资金在二百六十亿卢布以上，由于减低原料和材料批发价格而节省下来的钱还不计算在内。根据一九五一年在发展工业和运输业方面、在提高劳动生产率方面以及在减低生产成本方面所获得的成就，政府从一九五二年一月一日起又减低了五金、机器和设备、燃料、化学品、建筑材料和纸张的批发价格，并且减低了电力、热力和铁路货运的费用。
    三、新技术在国民经济方面的应用
    一九五一年在掌握新式机器、设备和材料的运用方面都获得了进一步的成就。
    苏联的机器制造工业在一九五一年内发明了约五百种非常重要的新式的机器与设备，确保了国民经济技术方面更大的进步。
    新式效力强大的蒸汽透平和高压锅炉，水力透平和水力发电机，空气开关，用于长距离输送电力方面的高压闭电器和避雷器，业已发明。
    在庞大水电设备的建设工程方面，为使费力的操作机械化，已制造效力强大的吸泥机和挖泥机，高效率单吊斗及复吊斗的挖掘机，用于自动混凝土制造厂方面的效力强大的混凝土调和器及二十五吨重的货车。
    母机工业精制将近一百五十种新式高效率的金属切削母机，锻冶与压铸机器，大量新型硬合金的机械工具。
    在石油工业、化学工业、轻工业、食品工业和其他工业及运输方面，业已制造许多新式设备。
    为了农田工作的进一步机械化，制造了各种新式犁土用的，种植、收割谷物、工业作物和蔬菜及其加工用的机器和器具。此外，为使配备饲料的工作机械化及为种植防护林带，已制造了许多新式机器。
    在国民经济各部门中，机械化的水平业已大大提高。
    在煤矿工业方面，截煤、凿煤、运煤和地下运输方法的机械化早在一九五○年完成。一九五一年开始采用在挖掘薄煤层和陡坡煤层方面使用的新式联合机，因而能够提高装煤工作机械化的水平。一千五百多台联合机和切煤机以及一千三百五十具连续生产装置，都已实行远离操纵的操作。
    在苏联木材工业部各企业中，机械化的伐木和运木的工作量增为一九五○年的一点七倍，机械化的装木工作量增为二点二倍，机械化的拖木工作量增为一点二倍。
    在一九五一年，国民经济各部门中继续实行高效率的新技术方法，并执行进一步使生产机械化的工作。
    在钢铁工业部各工厂全部钢的生产中，熔解在装有热度自动调节器的平炉中的钢有百分之八十七。特殊形状的压延金属的生产量也有增加，因而大量减少进一步处理金属时的消费。
    在有色金属工业方面，采用了凝聚和综合制炼矿物浓缩体与矿泥的新方法及完美的技术，因而有助于充分提炼有色金属和稀有金属。
    在石油工业方面，已扩大了透平式的钻孔机的使用。用保持地层压力的方法来进行的石油生产，已有进一步的发展。用苏联制造的机器来炼油的新技术方法已被采用，这样便能增加石油的产量并提高它们的品质。
    在机器制造方面，进一步使用制炼金属的先进方法——高速切削，处理金属的新的电力方法和热力方法。
    在控制大规模制造的零件的尺寸方面，已使用了自动的和半自动的装置。
    关于水力发电站广泛自动化和电力站锅炉间发热过程自动化的工作业已进行。地方水力发电站有百分之九十以上已有自动的工作单位。
    工人和机械技术人员为使生产过程完善和根本改善而计划的革新方法和合理化建议，在一九五一年已有将近七十万件得到采用。
    四、农业
    一九五一年，社会主义农业在发展耕种和牲畜饲养上，以及在集体农场的组织和经济的巩固上都已获得新的成就。根据苏联部长会议的统计数字，尽管伏尔加河流域、西伯利亚西部、哈萨克共和国和其他若干地区的气候失调，在一九五一年，谷物总收成仍达七十四亿普特。粮食——小麦和裸麦——的收成较一九五○年为高。未弹的棉花的总收成多于一九五○年并较前几年为高。甜菜收成则超过一九五○年二千七百万吨。
    在一九五一年，各种农作物的播种面积较一九五○年多六百七十万公顷。种植棉花、甜菜、向日葵和其他工业作物的面积业已扩大。播种的多年生和一年生的草类、刍秣、根菜作物和地下作物，业已大量增加。
    各集体农场和国家农场已经顺利完成为获得一九五二年丰收而播种冬季作物的计划。去年秋季耕犁以准备一九五二年春播的土地面积，超过一九五○年秋季耕作的面积五百四十万公顷。
    一九五一年农业技术的基础将更为牢固。
    去年农业方面获得十三万七千部拖拉机（十五匹马力的单位），五万三千部谷物收割联合机（包括二万九千部自动推进收割机），五万九千辆货车，以及二百万具耕土、播种、收割和其他的农业机器。
    农业方面技术设备的增加，使集体农场和国家农场的农业工作更进一步机械化。集体农场机器拖拉机站在一九五一年完成的工作较一九五○年增加百分之十九。去年机器拖拉机站完成集体农场一切田间工作的三分之二以上。集体农场的全部耕作和四分之三的播种工作都已机械化；集体农场全部种植谷物的区域百分之六十以上是由收割联合机所收割的。在国家农场，主要农业工作几已全部机械化。
    和农业机械化工作同时，在农业电气化方面也完成很多工作。一九五一年在集体农场处理谷物、准备饲料、供水、挤牛乳、剪羊毛方面所使用的电力业已大量增加。
    在一九五一年，集体农场和国家农场公有的家畜继续增加。集体农场的畜牧业和国家农场的畜牧业在全部畜牧业中占主要地位。
    一九五一年集体农场公有家畜头数增加的百分比如下：牛和乳牛百分之十二（牝牛百分之十五），猪百分之二十六，山羊和绵羊百分之八，马百分之八。集体农场家禽的数量增为一倍半。
    去年苏联国家农场部所属国家农场的牲畜增加情况如下：牛和乳牛百分之十五（牝牛百分之十四），猪百分之二十一，山羊和绵羊百分之十一，马百分之十四，家禽百分之二十七。
    在一九五一年，集体农场、国家农场、集体农民、职工的全部家畜的头数，将近增加一千四百万，其中包括一百六十多万头牛和乳牛，二百六十万头猪，八百五十万头山羊和绵羊，将近一百万匹马。在这一年中，家禽的数目增加六千多万只。
    在一九五一年内，苏联欧洲部分草原与森林草原地区的集体农场、林场、机器拖拉机站和造林站，以及国家农场共种植了七十四万五千公顷的防护林带。
    五、铁道、水路和汽车运输的发展
    一九五一年铁道运输计划已经超额完成，较一九五○年增加百分之十二。每日平均装载量的总计划超过百分之三。
    一九五一年国家计划所规定的加速货车运转率的任务已经超额完成。铁道运输每公里吨燃料消费较一九五○年减少百分之三。然而，关于改进铁道使用的计划没有全部完成。
    一九五一年内河货运计划完成了百分之一百点六，货运量比一九五○年增多百分之十三。
    一九五一年海道货运计划完成了百分之一百零二，货运量较一九五○年增多百分之八。
    汽车货运量较一九五○年增多百分之二十。
    六、国民经济中投资的增加
    一九五一年内完成了广大的建设计划。过去一年国家投资额为一九五○年的百分之一百一十二。在电力站建设工程方面的投资额为一九五○年的百分之一百四十，钢铁和有色金属工业方面为百分之一百二十，煤矿工业和石油工业方面为百分之一百一十二，机器制造业方面为百分之一百一十，建筑材料业方面为百分之一百三十五，机器拖拉机站和国家农场方面为百分之一百零六，运输业方面为百分之一百零三，房屋建筑方面为百分之一百二十。
    为在伏尔加河、顿河和第聂伯河上建筑巨大水力工程，以及为开凿土库曼大运河而规定的一九五一年的任务已顺利完成。
    一九五一年各营造机关获得大量的具有高度生产力的机器和设备。现有的挖掘机总数已比一九五○年增加了约百分之四十，铲土机增加百分之三十以上，压路机增加百分之八十以上，其他建筑机器和设备也很显著地增加了。建筑工程的全面机械化，在各处建筑工地上日益普遍地采用。建筑材料的供应已经改善。
    一九五一年营造机关使建筑费用比一九五○年减低了，建筑工程所需时间也比一九五○年缩短了。不过，有许多营造机关没有能够十足达成国家减低建筑费用的目标。
    国营企业、机关和地方苏维埃、以及各城市和工人住宅区的居民，凭借国家贷款建筑了地面面积共计二千七百万平方公尺的新房屋。另外在农村地区建筑了约四十万幢房屋。
    七、贸易的扩大
    一九五一年苏联的贸易继续扩大。由于一九五○年在工业和农业发展方面，在提高劳动生产率方面，以及在减低生产成本方面都已获得了新的成就，从一九五一年三月一日起，政府又实行了自从配给制取消以来的第四次减低一般消费品的价格。这次又减低物价的结果，苏联卢布益臻稳固，它的购买力提高了，销售给人民的货物量更进一步增加了。
    一九五一年国营商店和合作社零售给人民的货物销售量（按比较价格计算），比一九五○年增加百分之十五。个别项目货物的销售量增加情况如下：肉类百分之三十二、腊肠百分之二十九、鱼品百分之十四、牛油百分之十、植物油百分之四十、牛乳和乳制品百分之三十五、蛋类百分之二十、糖百分之二十九、糖果百分之十三、茶叶百分之二十九、水果百分之三十三、棉织品百分之十八、丝织品百分之二十六、服装百分之十四、皮鞋百分之十一、家具百分之五十。民用建筑材料百分之四十五、家用肥皂和香皂百分之十三、无线电收音机百分之二十六、钟表百分之十五、缝纫机百分之二十九、照相机百分之三十八、脚踏车百分之八十六。冰箱、洗衣机和真空清洁器的销售额已增加了好几倍。
    国营贸易和合作社贸易网扩大了。一九五一年约有八千家新商店开张。
    一九五一年在集体农场的市场上售给人民的农产品的销售量，特别是面粉、谷类、猪油、家禽、蛋、水果和蜂蜜的销售量，比一九五○年很显著地增加了。
    八、职工人数的增加和劳动生产率的提高
    一九五一年年底，苏联国民经济中职工人数达四千零八十万人，比一九五○年年底增加了一百六十万人。工业和农林业、营造业和运输业方面职工人数增加了一百二十五万人，教育机关、科学研究机关及医务机关方面增加了约二万五千人，贸易和房屋与公用事业方面增加了十万多人。
    一九五一年和往年一样，全国没有失业者。
    去年有三十六万五千个青年从贸易学校、铁道学校、采矿学校和工厂艺徒学校毕业成为熟练工人，并已在工业、营造业和运输业方面就业。
    有七百万职工凭借业余个别的或集体的教育，或进业余训练班而学会技能或提高了自己的技能。
    工业工人的劳动生产率，一九五一年比一九五○年提高百分之十，其中机器制造工业提高百分之十四，钢铁工业提高百分之九，有色金属冶金工业提高百分之六，煤矿工业提高百分之八，石油工业提高百分之九，化学工业提高百分之九，营造业提高百分之九点五。
    九、文化的发展、公共卫生和市政建设的改进
    一九五一年在社会主义文化的一切方面都得到了更进一步的成就。
    去年苏联学习的人数（包括各种方式的学习）达五千七百万人。
    七年制学校和中学在一年间增加了约五千所。这些学校中的五年级到十年级的学生人数增加了二百五十万人。
    一九五一年八百八十七所高等教育机关（包括函授班）的学生总数共一百三十五万六千人，比一九五○年增加十万零八千人。三千五百四十三个技术学校和其他专门中等学校（包括函授班）共有学生一百三十八万四千人，比一九五○年增加了八万六千人。
    一九五一年高等教育机关造就了二十万零一千名青年专家，技术学校造就了二十六万二千名青年专家。
    高等教育机关和技术学校的毕业生以专家资格在国民经济各部门服务的人数，一九五一年比一九五○年增加百分之八。
    一九五一年有两万四千多人在高等教育机关和科学研究所中继续深造。
    一九五一年有二千六百九十四名科学家、工程师、农业专家、作家和艺术家、工人和先进农业工作者，因为在科学、发明、文学和艺术方面有卓越成就，已荣膺斯大林奖金。
    一九五一年全国各地由国家机关和公共团体维持的各种图书馆共计三十五万多个，其中藏书超过七亿册。
    一九五一年影片放映机比前一年增加了四千部。一九五一年剧院和电影院观众比一九五○年增加了百分之十二。
    一九五一年夏天，有五百多万儿童和少年住在少年先锋营、儿童疗养院、或参加远足队和观光团，或者由幼稚园、儿童之家和托儿所以有组织的方式带到乡下去消磨整个的夏天。
    医院、产科医院、药房和其他卫生机关，以及疗养院和休养所网，在一九五一年更进一步扩大了。医院和产科医院中的床位比一九五○年差不多增加了五万个。疗养院和休养所中的床位增加了一万八千个。一九五一年医师人数比一九五○年增加百分之六。
    药品、医疗器械和装置的生产比一九五○年增加了百分之三十六，这就能够根本改进以药品、最新装置、实验室设备和医疗器械来供应和装置医疗机关的工作了。
    一九五一年和往年一样还完成了许多工作以建设公用事业，改进城市和工人住宅区，敷设自来水管和下水道，延长有轨电车道和无轨电车道，以煤气和热气供给更多的房屋，开辟草地、在市区和广场上铺筑石子路和柏油马路，布置公园、公共花园和林荫路。
    十、国民总收入和个人收入的增加
    一九五一年苏联的国民收入（按比较价格计算）比一九五○年增加了百分之十二。
    在苏联，全部国民收入属于劳动人民。和前一年一样，苏联的劳动人民得到国民收入之中的约四分之三来满足自己的个人物质生活和文化生活的要求，而国民收入之中的其余部分就归国家、集体农场和合作社组织去支配以便扩大社会主义生产，并满足整个国家和社会的其他需要。
    由于国民收入增加，工人、农民和知识分子的物质生活情况就能够很显著地改善，城乡社会主义生产也能够确保更进一步扩大了。
    苏联人民物质生活情况的改善，表现在职工的名义工资和实际工资的增加，表现在农民从共同经营的集体耕作方面，以及从他们的家庭园圃和个人副业方面所得收入的增加。
    此外，在一九五一年和在往年一样，人民更由国家供给补助费而获得各种利益，这就是：从职工社会保险基金项下领取各种的津贴和补助费，从社会赡养基金中领取养老金，免费或低费进疗养院、休养所和儿童教养机关，发给儿女众多的母亲和单身母亲的津贴，免费获得医疗，免费受教育以及职业的和专业的训练，奖学金以及其他许多报酬和利益。不但这样，所有一切职工，就是约四千一百万人，度过至少两个星期工资照付的假期，有若干行业的工人假期更长。一九五一年人民从国家补助费中享受到的这些报酬和利益总值达一千二百五十亿卢布。
    由于消费品价格的减低，由于职工们的名义工资的增加，由于农民现款和实物收入的增加，并且由于人民从国家补助费中获得的报酬和利益的增加——一九五一年职工的收入和农民的收入（按比较价格计算）比一九五○年增加百分之十。
