To the Editor:

    The Beijing Architectural Design Company was responsible for the design, bidding, and supervision of the entire school building project for the second branch of the High School Affiliated to Beijing Normal University, costing a total of 5.2 billion yuan. During construction, all materials were inspected by engineers from this company, such as Yang Weixin, and Zhang Bingzhou was appointed by the company as supervisor. Zhang Bingzhou did not understand the project and was not responsible. Our school repeatedly requested to replace him, but the company ignored us. One month after the school buildings were completed, the foundations at both ends of the classroom building sank, and four large cracks appeared from top to bottom, some even more than a finger wide. When the wind blew, some of the roof tiles were lifted. Some ceilings have already fallen off. Some cement floors have cracked. Some door locks broke after only a few days of use. The quality of copper fittings and window hooks was poor, and the painting was also substandard. There were problems with the electrical and sanitary installations. After our school discovered these issues, we wrote to the company three times, requesting them to address them. However, they were evasive and only said there was no danger, and did not seriously respond to the question of who should be held responsible. We wrote a fourth letter urging them, and they said that they were currently engaged in the Three-Anti Campaign (anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy) and did not have time to deal with this matter, and would wait until the campaign was over. We believe that if there are problems with the projects that they were responsible for designing and supervising, shouldn't this be a problem that should be investigated in this campaign? We request that the Beijing Architectural Design Company promptly correct its irresponsible attitude and thoroughly investigate this issue; at the same time, we also request that the relevant departments investigate the illegal activities of the Yusheng Construction Company and the Daye Construction Company, which were responsible for building this project.

### 北京市建筑设计公司  应对北京师范大学附中工程负责

    北京市建筑设计公司
    应对北京师范大学附中工程负责
    编辑同志：北京师范大学附中二部的全部校舍工程由北京市建筑设计公司负责设计、招标和监工，共花了五十二亿元。当施工时，一切材料都经这个公司的工程师杨维新等审查，并由公司委派张秉周监工。张秉周对工程不懂，也不负责任。我校曾几次提出要调换他，但公司置之不理。校舍盖好后
    一个月，教室大楼的两头地基就下沉，自上到下裂开四条大缝，有的竟有一指多宽。屋瓦经风一吹，有一部分就被风掀起。有的顶棚已脱落。有的洋灰地发生裂缝。有的门锁用几天就坏。铜活、窗钩等质量低劣，油漆粉刷的也不好。电器和卫生工程都出了问题。我校发现这些情况后，曾三次写信给这个公司，要求处理。他们却敷衍塞责，只说没有危险，对于应该由谁负责，则不认真答复。我们第四次写信催促，他们说，现在正搞反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，没时间管这事，等运动过后再说。我们想，他们负责设计、监工等的工程出了毛病，难道不是这次运动中应该追查的问题？我们要求北京市建筑设计公司迅速纠正不负责任的态度，彻查这一问题；同时也要求有关部门追查负责修建这一工程的裕升营造厂和大业营造厂的不法行为。
