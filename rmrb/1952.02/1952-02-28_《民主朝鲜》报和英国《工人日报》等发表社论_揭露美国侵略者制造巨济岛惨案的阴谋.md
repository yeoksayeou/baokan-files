Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 27th: 《Democratic Korea》 published an editorial on the 26th regarding the bloody incident of the US aggressors massacring a large number of our captured personnel on Koje Island, stating: The US aggressors extravagantly talk about "humanitarianism" and "peace" and "preferential treatment" of prisoners. At the Panmunjom armistice talks, they also said that "voluntary repatriation" is the "best way" to respect the human rights of prisoners. However, the facts in the US prisoner-of-war camps exposed their shameless true face.

The editorial pointed out: Due to the inhuman policy of the US-Syngman Rhee gangs of killing and abusing prisoners, prisoner-of-war camps in southern Korea have become hell on earth. In the past ten months alone, more than 17,000 of our captured personnel were killed, which aroused strong resistance from our prisoners of war. Now the US aggressors are brutally massacring large numbers of our captured personnel. The aggressors must bear full responsibility for this bloody massacre. The massacre of our captured personnel on Koje Island once again exposed the aggressive nature of US imperialism and its sinister conspiracy to insist on "voluntary repatriation" in the armistice negotiations.

The editorial emphasized: The enemy's beastly atrocities cannot deprive our captured personnel of their legitimate rights. If the enemy has the sincerity to abide by international law and peacefully resolve the Korean issue, it must accept our reasonable proposal to immediately release and repatriate all prisoners of war.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 27th: The London 《Daily Worker》 published an editorial on the 23rd, commenting on the US aggressors' crime of massacring our captured personnel in the Koje Island prisoner-of-war camp, saying: "When people all over the world hear this heinous news, they are shocked. This news is as appalling as any news from Hitler's concentration camps during the war."

The 《Daily Worker》 editorial expressed skepticism about the US's announcement of the massacre, and said: "One thing is clear: These unfortunate people must have been killed by American soldiers, and this massacre must be one of the most heinous bloody massacres in the Korean War."

The 《Daily Worker》 demanded that the Red Cross personnel of Korea and China participate in the investigation work that is said to be underway by American personnel and the International Committee of the Red Cross, and said: "In view of the inhumane attitude of the US military, there is no other way to do this."

Paris 《L'Humanité》 commented on the Koje Island massacre and the US's crime of using bacteriological weapons on the 23rd, saying: "Ridgway is attempting to use these crimes, which arouse the public anger of upright people around the world, to create an atmosphere unfavorable to the success of the Korean armistice negotiations."

　　《民主朝鲜》报和英国《工人日报》等发表社论
    揭露美国侵略者制造巨济岛惨案的阴谋
    【新华社平壤二十七日电】《民主朝鲜》报二十六日就美国侵略者在巨济岛大批屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥事件发表社论说：美国侵略者侈言什么“人道主义”与“和平”以及对俘虏的“优待”，在板门店停战谈判的会场上又说什么“自愿遣返”是尊重俘虏人权的“最好的方法”。但是，发生在美方战俘营里的事实却揭露了他们无耻的真面貌。
    社论指出：由于美李匪帮杀害和虐待俘虏的丧尽人性的政策，朝鲜南部各地的战俘营已成为人间地狱。仅在去年十个月中，即有一万七千余名我方被俘人员被杀害，这激起了我方战俘的强烈反抗。现在美国侵略者又凶暴地大批杀害我方被俘人员，这种血腥屠杀的责任完全要由侵略者担负。巨济岛我方俘虏被杀害的惨案，又一次揭穿了美帝国主义的侵略本质和它在停战谈判中坚持“自愿遣返”的险恶阴谋。
    社论强调说：敌人这种野兽般的暴行是绝不能剥夺我方被俘人员的正当权利的，敌人如有遵守国际公法与和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意，就必须接受我方立即释放并遣返全体战俘的合理提案。
    【新华社布拉格二十七日电】伦敦《工人日报》二十三日发表社论，评论美国侵略者在巨济岛俘虏营中屠杀我方被俘人员的罪行说：“全世界各地人民当听到这个令人发指的消息的时候，都十分震惊，这个消息，正象战争期间希特勒的集中营中传来的任何消息一样骇人。”
    《工人日报》社论对于美国所发表的关于这次屠杀的消息表示怀疑，并说：“有一件事是清楚的。这就是：这些不幸的人们必定是被美国兵杀害了，而这一次的屠杀，必定是朝鲜战争中最令人发指的血腥屠杀之一。”
    《工人日报》要求让朝鲜和中国的红十字会人员参加据说正由美国人员和红十字国际委员会进行中的调查工作，并说：“鉴于美军的不人道的态度，除了这样作以外，别无办法。”
    巴黎《人道报》二十三日评论巨济岛惨案和美国使用细菌武器的罪行说：“李奇微企图利用这些激起世界正直人民公愤的罪行，制造不利于朝鲜停战谈判成功的气氛。”
