    Editor's Note: The impure composition of the Production Increase and Economy Committee of the Communications Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as well as the unclean hands of certain leading cadres, serious right-leaning tendencies in leading the movement, and restrictions on reporters' freedom to interview, have aroused the attention of the Inner Mongolia Production Increase and Economy Committee, which has made preliminary corrections. Nine members of the Communications Department's Production Increase and Economy Committee have been removed from their posts, including Li Xiushan, Deputy Minister of Communications, and several embezzlers mentioned in the article. The Inner Mongolia Production Increase and Economy Committee has also sent a direct team to the Communications Department to help lead the movement. Reporters are now able to freely interview in the Communications Department. However, as of February 26, the movement in the Communications Department has not made much progress, and no major embezzlers have been caught. We believe that the leaders of the department should immediately conduct a deep self-criticism and thoroughly change their attitude towards the movement. The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region should supervise and inspect them to ensure a rapid change.

    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Communications Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, from its beginning until February 12 of this year, has failed to develop well and has been stalled in a state of confusion due to the unclean hands of leading cadres and their serious right-leaning thinking.

    The main key to mobilizing the masses in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle is to have responsible cadres go to the front line, taking the lead in self-criticism from top to bottom, and on the basis of mobilizing the masses, thoroughly eliminate all corrupt behavior and capture major embezzlers. The Communications Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region did not do this, but instead conducted self-criticism from the bottom up, with leaders making extremely shallow self-criticisms, causing the movement to remain stagnant. After Ulanhu, Chairman of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, issued a mobilization order on February 4 to encircle and suppress major embezzlers, the movement in the Communications Department still failed to achieve significant results. The most important reason for this is the unclean hands of certain leading cadres and their serious right-leaning thinking.

    First, the masses suspected that Li Xiushan, Deputy Minister of Communications, had unclean hands and raised many questions to him. Li dragged on for a long time until the evening of February 12, when he gave a vague explanation, only admitting that he had reported second-class train fare for third-class travel. The masses in the Communications Department believe that six members of the Production Increase and Economy Committee have unclean hands. Some of them are even major embezzlers. One member has confessed to using 40 million yuan of public funds. But he still remains in the command (Note: He has now been removed from his position as a member). The masses had opinions about the selection of personnel for the command from the beginning. These opinions have never been adopted by the leadership, but instead, people with corrupt behavior are asked to mobilize others to confess!

    Second, leading cadres in the Communications Department dare not seriously inspect within their own department, collect materials, and arrest embezzlers. The Communications Department has a large amount of operating expenses every year, but the accounts are chaotic, and most of the expenses do not have original receipts, but are white slips written by the person in charge. In these receipts, the same person in charge can have several different fingerprints; there are also the same fingerprints, but the names of several people in charge are written. According to the comrades who audited the accounts: Five or sixty out of every hundred receipts have problems (One member who has been removed from the Production Increase and Economy Committee has confessed to forging receipts twice, embezzling more than 1 million yuan). The iron bars bought by the Communications Department in Arxan have no accounts for receiving, purchasing, returning, or selling. At the time of purchase, except for the main person in charge, the lower-level cadres were frequently replaced. This left loopholes for embezzlers to embezzle. The Communications Department received timber from the Ministry of Finance, and there are detailed accounts for receiving and transporting, but it is not known whether the timber was used or stolen and sold. A female comrade said: "The leaders pretend to be deaf and dumb." Because of this, the Communications Department's arrest of embezzlers is "suppressing outsiders but not insiders": not suppressing within its own department first, but suppressing embezzlers working in Zhalantun first (of course, they must also be suppressed); "suppressing the distant but not the near," when struggling against the director of the Transportation Department, not starting with his embezzlement, but asking him to confess what collusion he had with the "Restoration Army" in 1946. After five or six days of continuous struggle, no major embezzlers were caught, but the masses' enthusiasm and energy for struggle were worn down.

    Even more serious is that leading cadres in the Communications Department condone embezzlers, shield embezzlers, and are insensitive. Here are a few examples: After the embezzler Bao Qiwen confessed at the meeting to embezzling more than 20 million yuan, he was immediately allowed to be the chairman of the meeting. The encirclement and suppression of major embezzlers is such a fierce class struggle, why should such a person be invited to be the commander? To what extent is this kind of error of distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves and losing our position serious! Bao Qiwen expressed that he would not be the chairman of the meeting, and Li Xiushan pushed a female comrade who had only been working for a few months to be the chairman. When Minister Uleji Aoqi'er (a Communist Party member) announced the lenient punishment of five embezzlers on the afternoon of February 12, Li Xiushan said to everyone at the meeting: "We believe that these five comrades have confessed more sincerely, and our entire leadership believes that they have no problems. Do you still feel that their tails have not been cut off?" The masses did not respond. Then he announced the list of these five embezzlers. As soon as he finished announcing, one of the embezzlers on the list immediately stood up and said: "My problem has not been explained clearly." Minister Uleji Aoqi'er quickly changed his words and said: "Then announce that four will be given lenient punishment." How can this kind of wrong action be tolerated! Here is another example. The masses believe that Bao Qiwen has not thoroughly confessed his embezzlement crimes, and the problem is still very big. Li Xiushan praised his confession as "sincere." In this way, there is another more absurd thing happening: The leadership believes that the original mess officer is suspected of embezzlement and wants to replace him. Who should be replaced? He was replaced by the embezzler Bao Qiwen, who they praised as "confessing sincerely." How can this kind of criminal action be tolerated! One comrade said: "I propose that the embezzlers continue to speak until they have clarified all the problems." But Minister Uleji Aoqi'er wanted to put it to a vote and conclude it, and said that I was disrupting the meeting!" Li Xiushan was sleeping on the table at the struggle meeting. When the masses gave him opinions, he evaded it vaguely, meaning that this could not be regarded as not attaching importance to the anti-corruption movement.

    I am a reporter for the Inner Mongolia Daily. When I discovered on the afternoon of February 12 that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Communications Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had so many and such serious problems as mentioned above, in order to deeply understand the situation and collect more comprehensive materials, I went to interview that evening. During the ten-minute break, I talked to a comrade who actively spoke at the meeting. We had not sat down and talked for three sentences when a person named Deng Yuwu came to me and said: "Go to the minister's room." I immediately went with him. As soon as I entered the room, Deng asked me: "Where are you a reporter from?" I replied that I was a reporter from the Inner Mongolia Daily. He asked again: "What are you talking to him about? Do you know him?" I replied: "I want to talk about the situation of your movement here. I knew him a little bit before." Comrade Bayin, who was sent by the Inner Mongolia Branch of the Communist Party to participate in the anti-corruption movement in the Communications Department, interrupted and asked me: "Did you get Minister Wu's approval to talk to him?" I said: "I don't think it is necessary." Minister Uleji Aoqi'er, who was sitting on the sofa, raised his head and said to me: "You have to temporarily stop the interview!" I asked why? He said: "Don't ask around, what he talks about may not be correct." I said I would judge. He still repeated three times: "Suspend the interview!" I asked why again. He replied: "I want to ask my superiors to see if they allow you to do this." I told him: "I have every right to do this. And I showed you the letter of introduction from the Inner Mongolia Production Increase and Economy Committee this morning." I immediately took out the letter of introduction from my pocket and showed it to him. Minister Uleji Aoqi'er read it and said: "I thought this letter of introduction was only for talking to me personally, not for talking to others."

    Minister Uleji Aoqi'er finally raised his voice and said to me: "You can't stop me from asking my superiors! Because I don't understand the way reporters operate. Now you must temporarily stop talking to him!"

    From the above series of facts, what is the intention of Uleji Aoqi'er, Minister of the Communications Department of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, to temporarily stop my interview? The facts are already very clear, there are only two explanations: one is that he is afraid that I will expose his crime of condoning embezzlers; the other is that his own hands are unclean, and he is afraid that I will find materials from the masses. There can be no other explanation.

    内蒙古自治区人民政府交通部的反贪污运动为什么停滞不前
    白植品
    编者按：内蒙古自治区人民政府交通部增产节约委员会成分不纯以及某些领导干部手脚不干净、领导运动严重右倾和限制记者自由采访等等的现象，已经引起内蒙增产节约委员会的重视，进行了初步纠正。交通部增产节约委员会的委员，已有九个被撤消职务，其中包括交通部副部长李秀山和文中所举的几个贪污分子。内蒙增产节约委员会并已派直属小组到交通部帮助领导运动。记者也已可以到交通部自由采访。但截至二月二十六日，交通部的运动仍无多大进展，没有捉到大贪污犯。我们认为：该部的领导人应该立即进行深刻的检讨，彻底转变对待运动的态度。内蒙古自治区人民政府并应加以督促和检查，使其迅速转变。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府交通部的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，从开始到今年二月十二日为止，由于领导干部手上不干净和有着严重的右倾思想，一直没能很好开展，停顿在混乱状态中。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中发动群众的主要关键，是要负责干部亲自上前线，由上而下，层层带头检讨，并在群众发动起来的基础上，彻底清除一切贪污行为，捕捉大贪污分子。内蒙古自治区人民政府交通部不是这样，而是由下而上检讨，领导者检讨得又极不深刻，致使运动始终裹足不前。二月四日，内蒙古自治区人民政府乌兰夫主席发出围剿大贪污犯的动员令后，交通部的运动仍未获得显著战果。这里面最主要的原因，是某些领导干部手上不干净和严重的右倾思想在作怪。
    首先，群众怀疑交通部副部长李秀山手上不干净，向他提出许多问题。李拖了很久，一直到二月十二日晚上，才支吾其词地作了一番解释，只承认自己有过坐三等车报二等车的票价的事。交通部的群众认为，增产节约委员会的委员中，有六个人手上是不干净的。其中有一部分人还是大贪污分子。有一个委员，已坦白了曾动用公款四千万元。但他还继续留在指挥部内（按：现已被撤消委员职务）。群众对指挥部的人选，一开始就有意见。这些意见，始终没有为领导方面所采纳，反而叫有贪污行为的人去动员别人坦白！
    其次，交通部领导干部不敢在本部内认真检查，搜集材料，捉拿贪污犯。交通部每年都有一笔很大的事业费，但是账目混乱，大部分的支出没有原始单据，都是经手人自己开的白条子。这些单据中，同一个经手人的名字，可以有好几个不同的指印；也有同一个指印，而写好几个经手人的名字的。据查账的同志说：一百张单据中，就有五、六十张有问题的（有一个已被撤消增产节约委员会委员职务的委员，已坦白承认自己假造单据两次，贪污一百多万元）。交通部在阿尔山买的铁筋，收、购、退、销，都没有账目。在采购当时，除了主要负责人以外，下面的干部则经常换人。这样就给贪污分子留下贪污的空隙。交通部向财政部领用木材，领、运都有详细账目，但木材究竟用了或被盗卖了，却不得而知。有一个女同志说：“领导上装聋又装傻。”正因为如此，交通部捉贪污犯是“剿外不剿内”：不先在本部内剿，而先剿在扎兰屯工作的贪污犯
    （当然也要剿）；“剿远不剿近”，斗争本部运输处长时，不先从他的贪污行为清算起，却要他先坦白一九四六年和“光复军”有什么勾搭。连续斗争五、六天，没有捉到大贪污犯，却把群众的斗争积极性和精力消磨下去了。
    更严重的错误是交通部领导干部纵容贪污犯、包庇贪污犯，麻木不仁。举几个例子：贪污分子包启文，在会上刚坦白了贪污二千多万元的罪行之后，立即让他当大会主席。围剿大贪污犯是多么激烈的阶级斗争，为什么要把这样的人请来当指挥官？这种敌我不分，丧失立场的错误，严重到何种程度！包启文表示不当大会主席，李秀山就把一个参加工作才几个月的女同志推上去当主席。乌勒吉敖喜尔部长（共产党员）在二月十二日下午宣布五个贪污分子从轻处罚时，李秀山在会上对大家这样说： “我们认为这五个同志坦白较诚恳，我们整个领导上认为他们没有什么问题了。你们是否还觉得他们的尾巴没有割掉呢？”群众不响。接着他宣布了这五个贪污分子的名单。刚宣布完了，列在名单上的一个贪污分子，立刻站起来说：“我的问题还没有交代清楚。”乌勒吉敖喜尔部长连忙改口道：“那就宣布四个从轻处罚好了。”这种错误的行动，怎么能够容忍！再举一个例子。群众认为包启文对自己的贪污罪行，没有彻底坦白，问题还很大。李秀山却表扬他的坦白是“诚恳”的。这样，就又有下一步更荒谬的事情发生：领导方面认为原来的伙食管理员有贪污嫌疑，要换一个人。换谁呢？就换为他们所表扬的“坦白诚恳”的贪污犯包启文。这种罪恶行动，怎么能够容忍！有一个同志说：“我提议让贪污分子继续说下去，直到把全部问题谈清为止。而乌勒吉敖喜尔部长却要加以表决了结，还说我捣乱会场！”李秀山在斗争会上伏在桌子上睡觉，群众给他提出意见，他又是支吾其词地挡了过去，意思是说，这并不能算是不重视反贪污运动。
    我是内蒙古日报的记者。当我在二月十二日下午发现了内蒙古自治区人民政府交通部的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动有着上述这么多、这样严重的问题时，为了深入了解情况，搜集更多更全面的材料，当天晚上，我前去采访。趁休会十分钟的时间，我找了一位在会场上积极发言的同志谈话。我们坐下还没谈上三句话，就有个名叫邓玉五的来找我，说：“你到部长那个屋子去一下。”我立即跟他去。一进屋，邓问我：“你是那里的记者？”我答是内蒙古日报记者。他又问：“你跟他谈些什么？你跟他认识么？”我答：“想谈些你们这里的运动的情况。跟他以前有一点点认识。”站在我旁边的中共内蒙古分局派去参加交通部反贪污运动的巴音同志插上来问我：“你跟他谈话，经过乌部长批准了没有？”我说：“我认为没有这个必要。”坐在沙发上的乌勒吉敖喜尔部长向我抬起头来说：“你现在要暂时停止采访！”我问为什么？他说：“你不要乱问，他谈的情况，不一定正确。”我说我会判断。他仍重复三遍：“暂停采访！”我再追问为什么。他答：“我要请示上级，看是否允许你这样活动。”我就告诉他：“我完全有这个权利。而且今天上午曾给你看过内蒙增产节约委员会的介绍信。”我立刻又从口袋里掏出介绍信给他看。乌勒吉敖喜尔部长看毕说：“我以为这个介绍信，只仅仅介绍跟我个人谈话，而不是跟别人谈话的。”
    乌勒吉敖喜尔部长最后提高声音对我说：“你总不能阻止我向上级请示吧！因为我不懂记者的活动方式。现在你一定得暂时停止跟他谈话！”
    从上述一连串的事实看来，内蒙古自治区人民政府交通部部长乌勒吉敖喜尔要暂时停止我的采访活动，用意在什么地方呢？事实已经很明显，只有两种解释：一是他怕我揭露他纵容贪污犯的罪行；一是他自己手上不干净，怕我从群众中找到材料。此外不能作其他任何解释。
