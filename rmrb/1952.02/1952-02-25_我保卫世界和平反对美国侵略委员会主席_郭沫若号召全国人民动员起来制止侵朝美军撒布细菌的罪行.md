Xinhua News Agency, February 24th:

    Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, issued a statement protesting and calling for an end to the heinous crimes of bacteriological warfare by the American aggressor troops. The statement is as follows:

    The American troops invading Korea have repeatedly and massively spread bacterial insects in the front-line positions and rear areas of the Chinese and Korean People's forces, carrying out inhumane bacteriological warfare. This heinous crime of extermination by the American aggressor troops has aroused unparalleled anger and excitement among the broad masses of the Chinese people. This extremely vicious and monstrous crime seriously violates the resolution of the World Peace Congress, representing the will of the people of the world, which prohibits the use of bacteriological, chemical, and all weapons of mass destruction, and also seriously violates all international laws and conventions prohibiting the use of bacteriological weapons. The serious destruction and threat to human civilization and justice carried out so wantonly by the American aggressor troops is absolutely intolerable to all peace-loving people in the world. On behalf of the China Peace Committee, I lodge a serious protest to the American aggressors who use such bacteriological weapons.

    As the whole world knows, since the end of World War II, the American aggressors have been keeping a large number of Japanese bacteriological war criminals, secretly researching and manufacturing various bacteriological weapons, and recently have been constantly using captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers and peaceful Korean residents as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons. At present, when the Korean armistice negotiations are being unreasonably obstructed and delayed by the American aggressors, the American aggressors have openly launched inhumane bacteriological warfare, which fully exposes the American aggressors' sinister conspiracy to prolong and expand the Korean War in preparation for launching another world war. Therefore, the monstrous crimes of the American aggressors in Korea are not only a frenzied massacre of peaceful Korean residents and the Chinese and Korean People's Armed Forces, but also a major threat to world peace and the safety of all mankind. All peace-loving people in the world should recognize that the American aggressors are the most dangerous enemies of world peace and human justice.

    This crazy crime of the American aggressors does not indicate its strength, but fully demonstrates the desperate struggle of the American aggressor troops sinking into the quagmire of the Korean battlefield. No aggressor in history, no matter how cruel and evil, has been able to save their dying fate. The tragic end of German and Japanese fascism is a clear example. I believe that this brutal crime of the American aggressors, which threatens world peace and tramples on human justice, will inevitably be met with the resolute opposition and resentment of peace-loving people all over the world, and will also inevitably suffer more heavy blows and punishment from the Chinese and Korean people. The American aggressors must bear full and final responsibility for the serious consequences of this atrocity.

    Now, on behalf of the China Peace Committee, I especially call on the people of the whole country:

    In order to safeguard world peace and human justice, in order to warmly support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean military and civilians who are fighting to the death with the American aggressors in Korea, the people of the whole country must mobilize, resolutely condemn and stop the heinous crimes of the American aggressors in carrying out bacteriological warfare in Korea; we must intensify our struggle, resolutely oppose and expose the American aggressors' conspiracy to obstruct and delay the Korean armistice negotiations. We must more resolutely carry out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and strive to increase production, practice strict economy, support the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and strive for a complete victory against the American aggressors.

    我保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席
    郭沫若号召全国人民动员起来制止侵朝美军撒布细菌的罪行
    【新华社二十四日讯】中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席郭沫若发表声明，抗议并呼吁制止美国侵略军进行细菌战的滔天罪行，声明如下：
    侵略朝鲜的美国军队，在中朝人民部队前线阵地和后方，连续多次地大量散播细菌毒虫，进行了违反人道的细菌战。美国侵略军这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行，已激起了全中国广大人民无比的愤怒和激动。这种穷凶极恶的滔天罪行严重地破坏了世界保卫和平大会代表全世界人民的意志所制定的禁止使用细菌、化学及一切大规模屠杀武器的决议，也严重地破坏了一切禁止使用细菌武器的国际公法和公约。美国侵略军这样肆无忌惮地对人类的文明和正义所进行的严重破坏和威胁，是全世界爱好和平人民所绝对不能坐视和容忍的。我代表中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会向使用这种细菌武器的美国侵略者提出严重的抗议。
    举世周知，第二次大战结束以来，美国侵略者就豢养着大批日本细菌战犯，秘密研究并制造各种细菌武器，最近曾不断地以朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员及朝鲜和平居民作细菌武器的实验品。目前在朝鲜停战谈判遭到美国侵略者无理地阻挠和拖延的时候，美国侵略者竟公然发动了违反人道的细菌战，这便完全暴露了美国侵略者企图延长并扩大朝鲜战争，以准备发动另一次世界大战的罪恶阴谋。因此，美国侵略者在朝鲜的滔天罪行已不单是对朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民武装力量的疯狂虐杀，它并且是对全世界和平与全人类安全的重大威胁。全世界爱好和平人民应当认清：美国侵略者就是世界和平与人类正义的最危险的敌人。
    美国侵略者的这种疯狂罪行，并不表明它的强大，却充分表明美国侵略军泥足陷入朝鲜战场的绝望挣扎。历史上任何侵略者任何残酷的罪恶手段都未能挽救其垂死的命运，德国和日本法西斯的悲惨下场，就是明证。我相信美国侵略者这种威胁世界和平、蹂躏人类正义的残暴罪行，必将遭受全世界爱好和平人民的坚决反对和愤恨，亦必将遭受中朝人民更沉重的打击和惩罚。美国侵略者必须对这种暴行的严重后果负其完全的和最后的责任。
    现在我代表中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会特向全国人民号召：
    为了维护世界和平与人类正义，为了热烈支援在朝鲜与美国侵略者作生死搏斗的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜军民，全国人民必须动员起来，坚决声讨并制止美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战的滔天罪行；我们必须加紧奋斗，坚决反对并揭露美国侵略者阻挠和拖延朝鲜停战谈判的阴谋。我们要更坚决地进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，并努力增加生产，厉行节约，支援朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军，争取反对美国侵略者的彻底胜利。
    中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会主席  郭沫若
    一九五二年二月二十四日
