	Employees of the Beijing Shanghai Bank Head Office,
	Qin Yuming, and others expose Zi Yaohua's true colors
	Editor: The February 3rd People's Daily published the news that "Tianjin financial industry launched an anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion struggle, Zi Yaohua's incomplete confession aroused public indignation." We – the employees of the Shanghai Bank Head Office – are extremely disgusted and indignant at the illegal acts and dishonest attitude of our bank's highest administrative leader, who refuses to bow his head to the people!

	Zi Yaohua has the nicknames "Veteran of Three Dynasties" and "Democratic Emperor" in our bank. From this, we can fully see what his essence is!

	Our bank joined the public-private partnership in the second half of 1950, and Zi Yaohua, as the manager of the Shanghai Bank Tianjin Branch, also served as the general manager. It is said that one of the conditions for him to become the general manager was to move the head office from Shanghai to Beijing. His ostensible reason was: "To be closer to the National Bank and accept direct leadership." In fact, in the year after our bank's head office was established in Beijing on September 1, 1950, the general manager never proactively contacted the People's Bank of China. Zi Yaohua was seen shuttling between Tianjin and Beijing, busy with unknown matters. This proves that moving our head office to Beijing was only for his personal convenience. The property he wasted in this regard is incalculable.

	After Zi Yaohua became the general manager, he consistently acted arbitrarily and rarely took care of matters. Every time he left the head office (he was away from the head office for about half a year each year), he often didn't give any explanation before leaving. Even if he did, he would deny it at any time. Therefore, he created a chaotic state in our bank's head office. He also consistently looked down on employees, played tricks, and undermined the prestige of the labor union. After our bank was officially transformed into a public-private joint venture on September 1, 1951, he even more blatantly used the name of the People's Bank of China to scare employees, attempting to create a conflict between employees and the National Bank. In these aspects, he hindered the development of our enterprise, and the extent of the damage is also inestimable.

	Zi Yaohua made a fortune during his tenure as the manager of the Tianjin Branch, and there are countless unclear matters. In order to cover up his own crimes, he used to obstruct the auditors sent by the head office in various ways, and refused to explain any problems. Now his dishonest attitude towards the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement can be said to be a manifestation of his consistent style. This kind of behavior is intolerable to the people of New China!

	In order to protect our own enterprise, we absolutely support the government's measures to thoroughly investigate Zi Yaohua's illegal acts. We also demand that he reflect on himself and quickly confess thoroughly. Not only should he clarify the past accounts of the Tianjin Branch, but he should also clarify how he and the "capitalists" colluded with each other, and whether he received extra allowances, etc.

    北京上海银行总管理处职工
    秦毓铭等揭露资耀华的面目
    编辑同志：二月三日人民日报登载了“天津市金融业展开反行贿反偷税斗争，资耀华坦白不彻底引起公愤”的消息。我们——上海银行总管理处的职工对我行行政最高负责人的违法行为和不老实、不肯向人民低头的态度，万分痛恶和愤慨！
    资耀华在我行有“三朝元老”和“民主皇帝”的称号。从这里可以充分表现出他的本质是什么！
    我行在一九五零年下半年加入公股，资耀华以上海银行天津分行经理兼任了总经理。据说他出任总经理的条件之一，是要把总管理处从上海迁到北京来。他在表面上的理由是：“靠拢国家银行，接受直接领导。”事实上我行总处自一九五零年九月一日在北京成立后的一年内，总经理根本就没有主动地和人民银行总行去联系过。只见资耀华一会儿天津、一会儿北京，不知忙些什么。这证明我行总处迁北京只是为了他个人的便利。在这方面，被他浪费了的财产是无法计算的。
    资耀华担任总经理之后，一贯地独断独行，而又很少管事。他每次离开总管理处的时候（一年中有半年左右不在总处），行前常常没有交代。就有，也会随时抵赖。因此，他造成了我行总处的混乱状态。他又一贯地瞧不起职工，玩弄手段，打击工会的威信。一九五一年九月一日我行正式改为公私合营后，他更变本加厉地假借人民银行名义来吓唬职工，企图造成职工和国家银行之间的对立。在这些方面，他对本企业的发展起了阻碍作用，其损害程度也是无法估计的。
    资耀华在天津分行经理任内发了家，不清不白的事情是难以计数的。为了遮掩他自己的罪恶，他过去对总处派去的查帐员曾多方阻挠，有问题也拒不交代。现在他对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的不老实的态度，可说是他的一贯作风的表现。他这种行为是新中国人民所不能容许的！
    我们为了爱护自己的企业，绝对拥护政府彻查资耀华不法行为的措施。我们更要求他好好地反省一下，赶快彻底坦白。不但天津分行的后帐他要交代清楚，而且要把他自己和“资方”如何互相勾结、有没有收受额外津贴等等都弄清楚。
