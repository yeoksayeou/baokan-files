Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 10th: At the tenth day's meeting of the delegations of both sides in the Korean armistice negotiations, our representative refuted in detail the counter-proposal put forward by the other side on the 9th regarding our principles and suggestions for the fifth agenda item. Our representative pointed out: In order to ensure the peaceful resolution of the issue, both sides should clearly suggest to the governments of the respective countries concerned that a high-level political conference of the governments of the countries concerned should be convened within a certain period to achieve this goal, rather than shrouding this suggestion in unnecessary words and ambiguous terms, as in the other party's proposal.

    First, the purpose of the military armistice negotiations is to end the hostile acts of both sides in Korea and withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, thereby creating the basic conditions for the Korean people to solve their own problems. In the military armistice negotiations, both sides have clearly reached an understanding that the political settlement of the Korean issue should be left to a higher-level political conference of both sides to achieve. Therefore, there is no need to include the sentence "The commanders of both sides have not reviewed the various issues related to the political settlement in Korea" in the other party's proposal within the part of the armistice agreement regarding suggestions to the governments of the respective countries concerned.

    Second, the other party's proposal suggests that both sides suggest to their respective governments and authorities to take steps within a period of three months to handle various issues in a political conference or by other appropriate political means. Our representative pointed out that, in order to ensure the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, it should be clearly suggested to the governments of the countries concerned to convene a political conference of the governments of the countries concerned, rather than merely suggesting to take "appropriate political methods," which in fact negates the definite convening of a political conference of the governments of the countries concerned; it should be clearly suggested to convene this political conference within three months after the signing and entry into force of the Korean Armistice Agreement, rather than using vague words such as "take steps," which fundamentally negates the significance of the three-month period.

    Third, regarding the content of the political conference of the governments of the countries concerned, the other party's proposal changed the third item in our proposal, "other issues related to Korean peace," to "other Korean issues related to peace." Our representative pointed out that the Korean issue is not isolated, and in order to ensure the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and consolidate peace in Korea, the political conference of the governments of the countries concerned should and must discuss and decide other issues related to peace in Korea. The other party's proposal essentially restricts the scope of the political conference of the governments of the countries concerned, excludes the issues that the political conference of the governments of the countries concerned should discuss and decide, and is therefore inappropriate. Our representative finally suggested that the other party seriously reconsider and accept our proposal of February 6th.

    At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, our staff members reiterated: Since the hostile acts have been terminated during the armistice, the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of weapons and ammunition entering Korea from outside Korea should be limited to the scope of the agreement and should obviously be greatly reduced. Therefore, there is no need to stipulate the huge rotation quotas and the number of specific rear ports as suggested by the other party. Especially after our side agreed to the other party's definition of rotation, with the quota for rotation limited to the personnel who initially entered Korea for military service and not including short-term vacations and personnel entering Korea for temporary assignments, it is even more impossible to require the huge numbers for rotation and rear ports as proposed by the other party.

    At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, both sides exchanged views on the continued provision of materials related to prisoners of war to each other and the repatriation of displaced civilians after the armistice.

    在十日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上
    我方详尽驳斥美方所提出的对案
    建议对方再次郑重考虑并接受我方提案
    【新华社开城十日电】十日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方代表详尽地驳斥了对方九日所提出的对我方第五项议程的原则建议的对案。我方代表指出：为了保证把问题和平解决，双方应该向双方有关各国政府明确建议，在一定期限内，召开双方有关各国政府的高一级政治会议，以达到这一目的，而不应该像对方的提案一样，将此项建议笼罩在不必要的语句和含糊的措辞之中。
    首先，军事停战谈判的目的，就是要终止双方在朝鲜的敌对行为，从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，这样来创造出基本条件，使朝鲜人民得以解决自己的问题。在军事停战谈判中，双方已经明确地达成谅解，朝鲜问题的政治解决应留待双方高一级的政治会议来予以实现。因此没有任何必要将对方提案中的第一句“双方司令官并未审议有关在朝鲜的政治解决的各种问题”的语句，包括在停战协定中关于向双方有关各国政府建议部分之内。
    其次，对方提案中提出双方向各自有关政府与当局建议在三个月的期限内，采取步骤，在政治会议中或以其他适当政治方法处理各项问题。我方代表指出，为了保证朝鲜问题的和平解决，就应该明确地向双方有关各国政府建议召开双方有关各国政府的政治会议，而不仅仅是建议采取“适当的政治方法”，在事实上却否定了双方有关各国政府政治会议的确定召开；就应该明确地建议在朝鲜停战协定签字并生效后三个月内，召开这一政治会议，而不应该以“采取步骤”等含糊的辞句，根本否定了三个月期限的意义。
    第三，关于双方有关各国政府政治会议的内容，对方提案中将我方提案中第三项“与朝鲜和平有关的其他问题”，改作“与和平有关的其他朝鲜问题”。我方代表指出，朝鲜问题不是孤立的，为了保证朝鲜问题的和平解决，巩固朝鲜的和平，双方有关各国政府的政治会议就应该也必须讨论和决定与朝鲜和平有关的其他问题。对方提案实质上限制了双方有关各国政府政治会议的范围，排除了双方有关各国政府政治会议所应该讨论和决定的问题，因而也是不适当的。我方代表最后建议对方再次郑重考虑，并接受我方二月六日的提案。
    第三项议程的参谋会议上，我方参谋人员再次指出：停战期间敌对行为业已终止，双方自朝鲜境外进入的军事人员的轮换与武器、弹药的替换，应该限于协议的范围之内，显然应有大量的削减。因此，也根本没有需要规定像对方所建议的庞大的轮换限额，和后方特定口岸的数目。特别在我方同意了对方关于轮换的定义后，以轮换的限额限于开始进入朝鲜服军役的人员，而不包括短期休假和担任临时任务人员的进入朝鲜，关于轮换与后方口岸，更不可能需要像对方所提出的庞大的数目。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，双方就停战后，互相继续提供有关战俘的材料，及关于流离失所平民的返乡问题交换了意见。
