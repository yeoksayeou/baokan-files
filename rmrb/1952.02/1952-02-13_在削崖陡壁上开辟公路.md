Opening a Highway on Sheer Cliffs

To the Editor: Since the construction of the Guanmao Highway in southwestern China began in July of last year, many exemplary deeds have emerged. When the laborers of the Second Detachment were working on the Fengbao Rock, they faced sheer cliffs where they could not stand, and the torrential Min River below, making the work extremely difficult. Under these circumstances, Zheng Wanfu, a model youth laborer, overcame the difficulties by tying two ropes from the top of the high mountain and suspending himself in the air to drill blasting holes. After a few days, a small path that people could stand on was blasted out. Ma Yuwen, a 53-year-old model laborer, has always been actively responsible for his work. Once, his son died of illness, and his family repeatedly wrote letters urging him to return, and his superiors also agreed to let him go back once. However, he insisted on not returning, saying, "Now that a shock campaign is underway, my departure will affect the work." Yang Tongdian, a well-known model laborer of the Second Detachment, heard that the laborers of a certain team could strike 700 blows in one breath. He thought: Why can't I do that? He mustered his courage, swung the twelve-pound hammer he usually used, and struck 1,200 blows in a row. This record immediately encouraged the work enthusiasm of all the laborers in the team. Shang Zexuan, a model laborer, continuously solved the supply problems of steel drills and iron bars, and also found ways to save a lot of materials such as charcoal. Thanks to their selfless work, the fourth section of the Guanmao Highway has completed 260,000 cubic meters of earthwork.

    在削崖陡壁上开辟公路
    编辑同志：西南灌茂公路修建工程自去年七月开工以来，涌现了很多模范事例，第二支队的民工们在风包岩工作时，眼看上边是削崖陡壁，没法站脚，下边是滔滔急流——岷江，作起工来十分困难。在这种情况下，青年民工特等模范郑万福打破困难，从很高的山顶上拴了两条绳子，把自己悬在空中打炮眼。几天后，一条能站人的小道被炸出来了。五十三岁的民工特等模范马玉文对工作一贯积极负责。有一次，他的儿子因病去世，家中再三写信要他回去，上级也同意他回去一次。但他坚持不回去，他说：“现在正展开突击运动，我一走就会影响工作。”第二支队有名的特等模范杨通典听说某队民工一口气能打七百锤，他想：我为什么不能这样？他鼓起勇气，抡起平常惯用的十二磅铁锤，一股劲连打了一千二百下。这一个纪录，立即鼓舞了全队民工的工作热情。民工特等模范尚泽萱曾连续解决钢钎、铁棍的供应问题，还想法节省了许多木炭等材料。由于他们的忘我工作，灌茂公路第四段的工程已完成了二十六万方。
