To our beloved Chairman Mao:

At the beginning of this year, our Inner Mongolia Balin Left Banner convened an expanded meeting of Mongolian and Han cadres from the banner, districts, and villages, summarized the work of production self-help, and formulated a plan for increasing production, increasing livestock, and protecting livestock in 1952.

Balin Left Banner is a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area. This place is drought-prone nine years out of ten. Last year, there was no thorough rain, and it was also hit by wind, frost, and hail disasters. In the autumn, only 20% of a normal harvest was achieved. Grain production was reduced, but the population increased. Last year, there were more than 12,000 immigrants from other places. The people's lives are very difficult. But we did not bow our heads to difficulties. The vast number of farmers and herdsmen in the banner united as one and implemented production self-help, and under the policy of "determining production by sales" and expanding domestic sales, they started various kinds of sideline production. According to incomplete statistics from October 1st of last year to January 1st of this year, the sideline income of the entire banner in three months reached 4.23 billion yuan in Renminbi.

We have decided to continue carrying out the patriotic production increase movement. We plan to operate sideline production for three months from January 1st to April 1st of this year, with an income of 4.5 billion yuan. At the same time, we must organize to prevent and fight drought, ensure that the land is planted, and improve production technology. On the basis of an average annual yield of 1,782 catties per hectare, we will increase production by 162 catties per hectare to achieve the goal of "increasing grain production by 450,000 tons" proposed by Chairman Ulanhu. In pastoral areas, we must do a good job in increasing production and protecting livestock, and increase net income by 15%. The people of our entire banner will definitely complete and strive to exceed production tasks with a high degree of patriotism.

The entire representatives of the Inner Mongolia Balin Left Banner, district, and village Mongolian and Han cadre expanded meeting

    内蒙巴林左翼旗蒙汉干部报告生产自救工作和抗旱备耕
    敬爱的毛主席：今年初，我们内蒙巴林左翼旗召开了旗、区、村的蒙汉干部扩大会议，总结了生产自救工作，并订出了一九五二年增产、增畜、保畜的计划。
    巴林左翼旗是半农半牧区。这地方十年九旱，去年一年，没降透雨，又遇到风、霜、雹灾，到秋天只有二成年景。粮食少收了，人却增多了。去年外来移民有一万二千多人。人民生活很困难。但我们并没有向困难低头。全旗广大农民、牧民一致团结起来，实行生产自救，在以销定产、扩大内销的方针下，搞起各种各样的副业生产。据去年十月一日到今年一月一日的不完全统计，全旗三个月中的副业收入就达人民币四十二亿三千多万元。
    我们决定继续开展爱国增产运动。我们计划自今年一月一日到四月一日的三个月内，经营副业生产，收入四十五亿元。同时，我们要组织起来，防旱抗旱，保证种上地，还要改进生产技术，在每垧平均常年产量一千七百八十二斤的基础上，每垧增产一百六十二斤，为实现乌兰夫主席提出的“增产四十五万吨粮食”的目标而奋斗。在牧业区，我们要作好增产保畜工作，增加纯收入百分之十五。我们全旗人民一定以高度的爱国精神，完成并争取超过生产任务。
