    Tianhe Coal Mine's Hu Yunsheng Team
    Learns from Advanced Experiences, Refines Division of Labor
    Sets New Record for Hand Pick Coal Mining
    Editor: The Hu Yunsheng team of Jiangxi Tianhe Coal Mine has created a new record for hand pick coal mining. After this mine launched the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the workers were all trying hard to find ways to improve. They were very anxious to see that the Pingxiang Coal Mine was constantly setting new records. In order to absorb advanced experiences, the leadership organized a coal mining worker visiting group, which went to the Pingxiang Coal Mine for a visit on December 19th of last year. After returning to the mine, the workers launched criticism and self-criticism, and studied and improved their operating techniques. In the past, a working face was done jointly by coal miners and support workers, without division of labor. This method wasted a lot of working time. Now, they divide the entire working face into three or four sections. The coal miners first finish mining the first working face, and then let the support workers erect the supports. The second and third working faces are also done in this way. This cyclical work method of dividing labor between coal miners and support workers has increased coal mining efficiency by seven times compared to the past. As a result, the mine saw new records set one after another. On January 24th, the Liu Zhilong team created a record of 50 tons of hand pick coal mining. On the 26th, the Xiao Zhuqing team set a new record of 72 tons of hand pick coal mining. On February 1st, the Hu Yunsheng team set another new record of 80 tons of hand pick coal mining, reaching the highest point in the country. The Hu Yunsheng team not only created a new record, but also saved 18 man-days and 3.5 kilograms of lamp oil.

    天河煤矿胡运生小组
    吸取先进经验精细分工
    创手镐采煤的新纪录
    编辑同志：江西天河煤矿胡运生小组，创造了手镐采煤新纪录。这个矿展开增产节约运动后，工人们都在努力想办法。他们眼看萍乡煤矿一再创新纪录，心里很着急。为了吸收先进经验，领导方面组织了采煤工人参观小组，在去年十二月十九日往萍乡煤矿参观。回矿后，工人们就展开批评和自我批评，研究改进操作技术。过去，一个工作面由采煤工人和支柱工人合做，没有实行分工。这种方法，浪费了很多的工作时间。现在，他们把整个工作面分为三个、四个，采煤工人先把第一工作面采完，再让支柱工人架棚子。第二、第三工作面也是如此。这种采煤工人和支柱工人的分工循环工作法，使采煤效率比前提高了七倍。因此，这个矿就出现了一次比一次高的新纪录。一月二十四日，柳志龙小组创造手镐采煤五十吨的纪录。二十六日，萧竹青小组又创手镐采煤七十二吨的纪录。二月一日，胡运生小组再创手镐采煤八十吨的新纪录，已达全国最高点。胡运生小组不但创造了新纪录，而且还节省了十八个人工，以及三点五公斤灯油。
