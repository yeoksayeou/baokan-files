    The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs Issues Statement
    Strongly Condemning U.S. Military's Germ Warfare in Korea and Massacre of Our Captured Personnel
    [This newspaper report] The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs issued a statement strongly condemning the U.S. invading forces' bloody crimes of using bacteriological weapons, massacring our captured personnel on Koje Island, and violating international law. The statement said: U.S. imperialism's launching of the war of aggression against Korea has long aroused the anger and condemnation of peace-loving people all over the world, and now it is becoming increasingly insane. Since January 28 of this year, the U.S. military has continuously and on a large scale used aircraft to spread bacterial insects on the Korean front and in the rear. This is an extremely barbaric and brutal act, and a great atrocity in the history of modern warfare. As is well known, the use of poisonous weapons has always been rejected by international customary law and has long been specifically included in the prohibitions of international conventions. Poison gas and bacteria all belong to poisonous weapons, and according to the principles of international customary law, they are not allowed to be used in war under any circumstances. The Hague Declaration of 1899 explicitly prohibited the release of poisonous gases, and the Geneva Protocol of 1925 reaffirmed the prohibition of poisonous gases and extended this prohibition to bacteriological warfare. The United States cannot fail to be bound by this kind of international convention, which represents the principles of international customary law and is accepted by most countries, for any reason. In short, the bacteriological warfare now being carried out by the U.S. military in Korea is a crime against humanity and a violation of international law, and therefore constitutes a serious international crime.
    On the 18th of this month, the U.S. military carried out a planned and frenzied massacre of our captured personnel in the prisoner-of-war camp on Koje Island. This inhuman act is a further violation of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War, which the United States itself participated in. The brutal fact that the U.S. military frantically massacred our prisoners of war exposes to the world that the atrocities of U.S. imperialism have reached an extremely barbaric point and pose an unprecedented threat to peaceful humanity.
    The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs calls on peace-loving people all over the world to unite and stop the insane atrocities of the U.S. imperialists, and to impose the most severe sanctions on those responsible for actually participating in these atrocities.

    中国人民外交学会发表声明
    严斥侵朝美军撒布细菌和屠杀我被俘人员
    【本报讯】中国人民外交学会发表声明，严斥美国侵略军使用细菌武器、屠杀巨济岛我方被俘人员、破坏国际法的血腥罪行。声明称：美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，早已引起全世界和平人民的愤怒和谴责，现在它愈来愈疯狂。本年一月二十八日起，美军连续在朝鲜前线和后方用飞机大规模地撒布细菌毒虫。这是极端野蛮残暴的行为，是近代战争史上的大暴行。如所周知，使用毒物武器，从来就为国际习惯法所摒斥，并且久已特别订入了国际公约的禁条。毒气细菌都属于毒物武器，按照国际习惯法的原则，在战争上是一律不得使用的。一八九九年海牙宣言已明禁施放毒气，一九二五年日内瓦议定书又重申毒气的禁例，并把这禁例推及于细菌战。对于这种代表国际习惯法原则，而为一般国家所接受的国际公约，美国是不能够以任何理由而不受其拘束的。总之，美军现在朝鲜进行的细菌战，是违反人道的破坏国际法的罪行，因之构成严重的国际犯罪行为。
    本月十八日，美军在巨济岛上俘虏营又对我方被俘人员进行有计划的疯狂的屠杀。这一惨无人道的行为，更是破坏了美国自己参加了的日内瓦俘虏公约。美军疯狂屠杀我方俘虏的这一残暴事实，向全世界暴露了美帝国主义的暴行已达到了极端野蛮的地步，对于和平人类形成了空前的威胁。
    中国人民外交学会号召全世界和平人民，一致起来制止美帝国主义者的疯狂暴行，并对美方实际参与这些暴行的负责人员加以最严厉的制裁。
