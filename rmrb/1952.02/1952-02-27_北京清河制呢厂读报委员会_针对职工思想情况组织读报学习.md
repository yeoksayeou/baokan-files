    Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill Reading Newspaper Committee
    Organizes Newspaper Reading Study Aimed at Workers' Ideological Situation
    Editor Comrade: During the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, our Newspaper Reading Committee promptly arranged for workers to study the newspaper and organized discussions, so that the workers received a good political education, promoting the development of the movement in our factory.
    The Newspaper Reading Committee first convened a joint meeting of newspaper readers, inviting the Propaganda and Education Committee member of the Party General Branch to report on the significance of the anti-corruption and anti-waste movement, calling on the newspaper reading groups to play a regular educational role in the movement. The Newspaper Reading Committee is responsible for designating the study materials every day, and holds a meeting of the newspaper reading group leaders every weekend to report on the newspaper reading activities of each group and the ideological situation of the members, and to arrange the newspaper reading work for the next week. At the beginning of the movement, many workers did not have a concrete understanding of the significance of "repelling the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack." They said: "How does the bourgeoisie attack?" In response to this idea, we selected materials about the bourgeoisie corrupting cadres and stealing state property, mobilized everyone to read them, and organized the factory's "tiger-fighting" team and reporters from various workshops to convey to the newspaper reading groups the facts of the bourgeoisie's attack on our factory, and led everyone to discuss them. Tianjin Chengtai, Yongsheng and other pigment shops colluded with Wang Fengzhang, a major corrupt element in our factory, and mixed about three-quarters of dyes directly used for dyeing cotton into a large batch of mordant colors sold to our factory, while the price of mordant colors is generally more than twice as expensive as direct colors. The profiteers obtained a lot of illegal profits from it. The profiteers mixed saltpeter, soot, white sand, yellow soil, table salt, whitening powder and even white flour into acid brown, acid navy blue, and mordant green, with the highest adulteration reaching 74.4% (that is, more than 74 jin of impurities can be mixed into every 100 jin of pigment). The inside traitor Wang Fengzhang and others purchased more than 1,000 kilograms of high-quality pigments from our factory at low prices, and exchanged them for more than 600 kilograms of inferior pigments mixed with impurities at high prices. According to preliminary estimates, since liberation, profiteers have obtained illegal profits of more than 4 billion yuan from the pigments purchased by our factory. The fine-woven navy blue woolen fabrics and blankets produced by our factory faded after being worn for a short time due to the use of these inferior pigments, and this loss is even more incalculable. These vivid facts helped everyone recognize the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack, and recognize that the bourgeoisie had already infiltrated our workshop. Therefore, everyone expressed that they would resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's attack.
    Next, the newspaper reading group solved the second ideological problem of the workers. At first, many young workers subjectively believed that Communist Party members would not be corrupt. Therefore, when they learned that some party members also had corrupt behavior, they felt very strange, and even unconsciously exaggerated this situation. After reading newspapers, studying and discussing, they changed their views and correctly realized that the vast majority of Communist Party members wholeheartedly serve the people. Only a very small number of party members have corrupt behavior. Some of these people lost their position because they could not resist the temptation of the bourgeoisie, and some were class dissidents who had infiltrated the party. The workers also saw from some corruption cases exposed and handled in the newspapers that the Party punishes senior cadres and party members equally according to the law. This further made them realize that the Communist Party is a truly bright and great party, and is determined to fight "tigers" and eliminate the filth left over from the old society. Therefore, they loved and respected their party even more, and fought more resolutely and bravely against the bourgeoisie.

### 北京清河制呢厂读报委员会  针对职工思想情况组织读报学习

    北京清河制呢厂读报委员会
    针对职工思想情况组织读报学习
    编辑同志：在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中，我们读报委员会及时布置职工学习报纸，并组织讨论，使职工们受到很好的政治教育，推动了本厂运动的开展。
    读报委员会首先召开了读报员联席会议，请党总支宣教委员报告反贪污浪费运动的意义，号召读报组在运动中发挥经常的教育作用。读报委员会每天负责圈定学习材料，每周周末召开读报组长碰头会，报告各组读报活动及组员的思想情况，布置下周的读报工作。运动开始时，许多职工对“打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻”的意义，了解得很不具体。他们说：“资产阶级怎样进攻呢？”我们针对这种思想，选择资产阶级腐蚀干部，盗窃国家资财的材料，发动大家阅读；并组织本厂“打虎”队及各车间采访员，向读报组传达资产阶级向本厂进攻的事实，并领导大家讨论。天津成泰、永盛等颜料庄勾结本厂大贪污犯王峰章，在卖给本厂的大批染毛媒介色中，掺入染棉直接色四分之三左右，而媒介色价格一般较直接色贵一倍多至两倍。奸商从中获取很多非法利润。奸商在酸性棕、酸性藏青、媒介绿中，掺入了芝硝、锅烟、白沙、黄土、食盐、拿开粉甚至白面，其中最高掺杂量竟达到百分之七十四点四
    （即每百斤颜料中可以掺入七十四斤多杂质）。内奸王峰章等以低价套购本厂上等颜料一千多公斤，以高价换回掺有杂质的劣等颜料六百多公斤。据初步估计，解放以来，奸商在本厂购入的颜料中，获得非法利润达四十多亿元。本厂精织的藏青呢料、毛毯，因采用这些劣等颜料，穿用不久就退色了，这种损失更是无法估计。这样一些活生生的事实，帮助大家认识了资产阶级进攻的猖狂，认识了资产阶级已经打入了我们的车间，因此，大家表示，一定坚决打退资产阶级的进攻。
    接着，读报组又解决了职工第二个思想问题。起初，有很多年青工人，主观地认为共产党员都是不会贪污的。因此，当他们知道有些党员也有贪污行为时，就感到很奇怪，甚至把这种情况不自觉地夸张起来。经过读报学习和讨论，他们改变了这种看法，正确地认识到绝大多数的共产党员都是忠心耿耿地为人民服务的。有贪污行为的党员只是极少数的。这些人，有的是经不起资产阶级的引诱而丧失了立场，有的是混进党内来的阶级异己分子。职工们又从报纸上揭发和处理的一些贪污案件中，看到了党对于高级干部和党员，都是一样的依法惩治，这就进一步认识到共产党是真正光明伟大的党，是有决心打“老虎”，清除旧社会遗留下来的污毒的。因而，他们越加热爱和尊敬自己的党，越加坚决、勇敢地向资产阶级作斗争。
