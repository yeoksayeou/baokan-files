    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 30th: News from Cairo: On January 26th, 500,000 people in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, held a large-scale demonstration to protest the British army's atrocities in occupying Ismailia.
    On January 25th, after a series of bloody atrocities, the British troops that invaded Ismailia demanded that the Egyptian auxiliary police in the city lay down their arms and leave the canal zone. The Egyptian police refused this unreasonable demand, and the British army attacked the police headquarters. The Egyptian police resisted until they ran out of ammunition. According to a communique from the Egyptian Ministry of Interior, 46 Egyptian policemen were killed, 42 were injured, and more than 800 were captured by the British army. The British aggressors subsequently claimed that they would occupy Ismailia indefinitely and blockade the entire canal zone.
    This provocative act by the British aggressors aroused great anger among the Egyptian people. On the afternoon of the 26th, 500,000 people in Cairo held a large-scale demonstration. Demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with Britain" and "Down with Egyptian traitors," and in anger, they smashed and set fire to many British-owned properties. All cinemas and entertainment venues in Alexandria closed on the evening of the 25th to mourn the Egyptians who died in the Battle of Ismailia.
    The new upsurge in the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist struggle greatly alarmed the Egyptian ruling class. The Egyptian government has declared martial law throughout the country and stipulated that gatherings of more than five people will be sentenced to two to five years or more in prison. The Egyptian government is also preparing to take severe measures and arrest patriots on a large scale.

    抗议英军侵占伊士美利亚  
    开罗五十万人民示威  
    埃及统治阶级大为恐慌
    【新华社三十日讯】开罗消息：埃及首都开罗五十万人在一月二十六日举行大示威，抗议英国军队侵占伊士美利亚的暴行。
    一月二十五日，侵入伊士美利亚的英国军队继一连串的血腥暴行之后，要求该城的埃及辅助警察放下武器并离开运河区。埃及警察拒绝了这一无理要求，英军就向警察总部进攻。埃及警察一直抵抗到弹药打完为止。据埃及内政部公报说，埃及警察死四十六名，伤四十二名，并有八百多人被英军俘去。英国侵略者事后声称将无限期地占领伊士美利亚，并封锁整个运河区。
    英国侵略者这一挑衅行为，激起了埃及人民的巨大愤怒。二十六日下午，开罗五十万人民举行了大规模的示威游行。示威者高呼“打倒英国”，“打倒埃及卖国贼”的口号，并在愤怒中捣毁和纵火焚烧了许多属于英国人的产业。亚历山大港的所有电影院和娱乐场所在二十五日晚全部停业，以向在伊士美利亚之战中牺牲的埃及人志哀。
    埃及人民反帝斗争的新高涨，使埃及的统治阶层大为恐慌。埃及政府已宣布全国戒严，并规定五人以上的集会就要被判两年到五年或五年以上的徒刑。埃及政府并已准备采取严峻的措施，大批逮捕爱国者。
