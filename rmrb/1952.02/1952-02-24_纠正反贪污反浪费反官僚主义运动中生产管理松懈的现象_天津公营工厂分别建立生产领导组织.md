    Correcting Slack Production Management During the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign
    Tianjin Public Factories Establish Production Leadership Organizations
    To correct the slackening of production management after the vigorous launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, the Tianjin Municipal Public Factories Bureau’s subordinate Zhonghua Match Factory and Knitting Factory have established production command offices and joint production teams, respectively, to lead production.

    The production command office of the Zhonghua Match Factory is directly led by the factory director. Its members include the union's production committee member, one administrative cadre, three workshop directors, and three foremen. These individuals report every morning on the previous day's plan completion and existing production problems and assign the tasks for the day. Except for major issues encountered during the reporting that are submitted to the factory director for handling, the production command office personnel collectively study solutions and resolve them promptly. For example, when it was discovered that there was insufficient blueprint paper, the command office immediately notified the business section to purchase it; when it was discovered that the stems were wet and could not be supplied, they promptly studied the use of baking materials from the roasting boxes. Because of this production command organization, production has been carried out in an orderly manner. Currently, the factory is exceeding its daily production plan.

    The knitting factory's joint production team is composed of cadres from the factory union and the planning, production, and operations departments. It is divided into three groups, assigned to solve various types of production problems. For example, due to administrative oversights, the dyeing department had repeatedly dyed several batches of Yongzi velvet with imperfections. After the establishment of the joint production team, the union mobilized workers to put forward rationalization proposals and began to improve the process. Other factories under the Public Factories Bureau are also establishing similar organizations to overcome the slack production management phenomenon. (Xinhua News Agency)

    纠正反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中生产管理松懈的现象
    天津公营工厂分别建立生产领导组织
    天津市公营工厂管理局所属中华火柴厂、针织厂，为了纠正在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动猛烈展开后生产管理松散的现象，分别建立了生产指挥室和生产联合组，负责领导生产。
    中华火柴厂的生产指挥室，直接由厂长领导，组成人员有工会生产委员、一个行政干部、三个车间主任和三个领班。这些人每天早晨汇报前一天完成计划的情况和生产上存在的问题。并布置当天的任务。除汇报时所遇重大问题呈报厂长处理外，一般的都由生产指挥室人员共同研究办法，及时解决。如发现蓝纸不够时，指挥室立即通知业务课采购；发现梗子湿供应不上时，就及时研究利用烤盒料的炕烘烤。因为有了这一生产指挥组织，生产的进行就有条不紊。现在这个厂每天的生产计划都超额完成。
    针织厂的生产联合组，是由厂工会与计划、生产、经营等科的干部组成的，下分三个小组，分派负责解决各种性质的生产问题。如因行政方面未及时照顾，漂染部曾连续把几批甬子绒染花，建立生产联合组后，工会就发动工人提合理化建议，着手改进。公营工厂管理局所属其他各厂，目前也在建立这类组织，以克服生产管理上的松散现象。  （新华社）
