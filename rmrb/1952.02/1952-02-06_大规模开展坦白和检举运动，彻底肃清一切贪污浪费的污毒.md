Former Secretary of the Cang County Party Committee of the CCP
Gan Chunlei's Corruption and Waste are Very Serious; He Should Return to the Cang County Party Committee to Explain Clearly

To the Editor: Gan Chunlei, the former secretary of the Cang County Party Committee of the CCP (now working in the North China Nationalities Affairs Commission), fraudulently obtained a bank loan of 30 million yuan and misappropriated 700 million yuan of construction funds from the Party School and Cadre Sanatorium for organ production while working in the Cang County Party Committee. Gan Chunlei spent 2 to 3 million yuan on banquets every month. Last summer, when he held a dance party, he specially trained a group of service personnel to deliver watermelons, collect watermelon peels, and hand towels to the dancers, and stipulated that the order must not be disrupted and hinder the dance. When he went to Jianguo County to inspect work, he notified the Jianguo County Party Committee three days in advance to repair the bus station to welcome him. Before transferring jobs, he took 10 million yuan of organ production funds and bought western medicine, cigarettes, leather suitcases, and other items to take away, and also took away some valuable things from the organ. Gan Chunlei and Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan used to give each other gifts, and there are also many unclear entanglements. Now the members of the Cang County Party Committee of the CCP have requested the Hebei Provincial Party Committee of the CCP to transfer Gan Chunlei back to allow him to clearly explain his problems of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. I think these opinions are correct.

Wei Guo and Gao Qingshan Had Serious Corruption in Fengnan

Wei Guo, the former secretary of the Fengnan County Party Committee of the CCP, Gao Qingshan, the county magistrate, and others used their power to turn the Minsheng Goods Station and two factories (mainly engaged in the pig bristle industry) run by the county party committee into the property of a few people. Wei Guo sent his younger brother Xiao Meng and relative An to be the managers of the two factories. They used "special expenses" to buy blankets, leather overcoats, fountain pens, and watches. Some county party committees also bought watches for their wives. Their daily wear and use cost more than 10 million yuan per person. Wang Yunbo, the secretary of the county youth committee, was attacked by them because he was unwilling to collude with them and opposed their illegal behavior. They behaved extremely unseriously in terms of relationships between men and women. Wei Guo and Shi Guang, the Minister of Propaganda, introduced a female announcer with political problems to Gao Qingshan as his lover and developed her into a party member, seriously losing the principles of the party. Because the leading comrades of the county party committee were dishonest, they encouraged the corruption of district cadres. For example, the district chief and the district party secretary colluded to embezzle pre-purchased grain, relief grain, loan wheat grain, and river work grain. Corruption is also extremely serious in other areas. The local party committee should deal with it quickly.

Relevant Leadership Aspects of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province
Severely Punish Li Wenjie, a Corrupt Element Who Refuses to Confess

To the Editor: Li Wenjie, the leader of the Taiyuan Public-Private Joint New Construction Company in Shanxi Province, is corrupt and wasteful and refuses to confess. In order to steal money and materials in national construction projects, Li Wenjie bribed Cao Jimin, a construction supervisor of the Shanxi Construction Bureau (who has now absconded), with several thousand catties of millet. In the second half of 1950, when the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee of the CCP sent people to investigate the company's funds, he underreported a portion of the funds. He used the concealed funds to buy a car. In terms of life, he has become corrupt to the point where every meal must have chicken, duck, fish, and meat, and he cannot swallow without wine. Fearing that someone would expose his evil deeds in the future, he replaced several correspondents. When the company closed down, Li Wenjie was afraid that the cadres would gossip, so he used the method of dividing the spoils and paid each person half a month to one and a half months' salary. He refused to confess these evil deeds in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. I hope the relevant authorities will severely punish Li Wenjie.

Yanjing University Has Serious Waste Phenomenon

To the Editor: Yanjing University recently held a conference at which President Lu Zhiwei made a review of his bureaucratic style, and teachers and students exposed the university's serious waste and bureaucracy. Everyone believed that Lu Zhiwei's review was not thorough enough and asked him to make a more profound review, which he has promised to do. The meeting revealed that the General Affairs Section had more than 500 million yuan worth of materials in six warehouses, including 443 boxes of white paper worth more than 300 million yuan, as well as a large number of medicines such as vitamin pills, calcium tablets, wire bandages, and absorbent cotton. Last year, when launching the donation campaign to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, students and staff members advocated donating these materials to the volunteer army, but Wang Hanzhang, the director of the General Affairs Section, said no. The students were very angry after hearing about this. Three parachutes were also found in the warehouse, two of which had been bitten by mice. These items are valuable property of the people, how can they be allowed to be wasted like this! When counting the old Mu Lou warehouse, it was found that the flags of the Kuomintang reactionaries were still preserved. May I ask who our warehouse is serving and why should we keep these things? The farm has more than 1,000 fruit trees, but Fan Yihua, the director of the farm, came up with an idea to start the tractor to turn the soil (he said "I want the workers to see the tractor"), as a result, 826 of the fruit trees were killed, causing the people to lose more than 390 million yuan. When the farm demolished the houses, the wood was piled on the ground at will without protection. Today, these woods have turned into powder. The engineering department bought 100 tons of lime, but only used 60 tons, and 40 tons were left, of which 30,000 catties could not be used because they were washed away by rain. Only 1% or 2% of the accounts of the material factory are correct, and the rest are either forged or incomplete. The accounts of the General Affairs Section are also a mess. Coal is often lost, and 46 tons of coal have been lost in the past two years. The masses could not contain themselves when they heard about it, and they demanded a thorough investigation of Wang Hanzhang and others who were related to the above matters.

My Daughter Helped Me Confess My Crimes of Corruption

I am the head of the Business Section of the Municipal Telephone Division of the Shanxi Provincial Posts and Telecommunications Administration. When I was in charge of the audit work, I once altered the receipts eight times and embezzled more than one million yuan of public funds.

When the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, I listened to the report and studied the documents, and I had a preliminary understanding of the policies of this movement. After listening to the self-criticism of the responsible comrades of our unit at the conference, I thought about talking about all my problems. But I was afraid of "implicating" others, being sent to court, and that family life would be impossible, etc. I also thought, I embezzled, only I know; if I don't talk about it, others will not expose it. The problem of me and my colleague Hou Zhu colluding to embezzle, as long as he doesn't talk about it, I don't talk about it, no one will know. Or, wait and see what happens before talking about it. I adopted a waiting, watching, and probing attitude, trying to "slip" through. However, a person with ulterior motives always behaves unnaturally in words and deeds. One day when I came home, my daughter Jia Yuqin (a member of the Communist Youth League) saw that my expression was not right, so she said that I must have a problem in my thinking. She picked up the Shanxi Daily and asked me to read it, and said to me: "The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is a great movement to fight sharply against the decadent and degenerate thinking of the bourgeoisie; it is also a good opportunity to save oneself and others." I was very sad after listening to my daughter's words and reading the newspaper. I also thought that the agreement between me and my colleague Hou Zhu not to talk about our problems was an act of resisting the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and it was also a crime on top of a crime. I couldn't help but shed tears. I couldn't eat or sleep. At two or three o'clock in the middle of the night that day, I woke up my daughter and lover and talked about my series of corruption problems. They asked me to tell the organization all the problems. I had the courage and determination. The next day, I told the organization about my problems. But I still didn't talk about the matter of colluding with Hou Zhu to embezzle. I thought it was best not to talk about things that "implicated" others. After returning home, my daughter knew about my confession. She solemnly said to me: "You are simply looking for death. You must know that telling your problems with Hou Zhu is helping Hou Zhu; you shouldn't harm others and yourself." This time my thinking was opened up. On the third day, after I confessed all my problems to the organization, the leading comrades announced at the conference that they would not punish me.

How can I not be moved by this? I have nothing else to say. In the future, I must start a new life and work hard to answer Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's leniency towards me.

Certain Organs and Units Under the Dezhou Commissioner's Office
Careless Management of Funds Causes Waste

To the Editor: When the Finance Section of the Dezhou Commissioner's Office in Shandong Province inspected the financial management of various organs and units, it was found that some organs and units did not earnestly implement the system and did not have careful work plans, which seriously wasted state property. When the Finance Section of the Commissioner's Office printed the agricultural tax collection forms last year, it only wanted to make the work easier, did not follow the system, and did not conduct a detailed investigation before printing, resulting in the overprinting of more than 76,800 copies, wasting more than 25 million yuan of state property. The Lihua Oil Rolling and Ginning Factory under the Commissioner's Office had poor planning in its basic construction project, changed the work midway, and did not follow the procedures, resulting in exceeding the original budget by 144 million yuan. When the ginning factory spent the excess funds, it did not make a supplementary budget, and it misappropriated working capital without the approval of the higher authorities, which affected production. In other aspects, such as the extravagance and waste of meetings, the figures are also very large. It is estimated that the waste of meetings and receptions in the entire special zone from January to October last year totaled more than 85 million yuan.

The main reasons for the waste are the chaotic financial system and the serious bureaucratic style of the leading cadres of the relevant departments. I hope that the Dezhou Commissioner's Office will effectively strengthen its leadership over the subordinate units in the future and improve and supervise the financial management of these units.

    大规模开展坦白和检举运动，彻底肃清一切贪污浪费的污毒
    前中共沧县地委书记
    甘春雷贪污浪费很严重应回沧县地委交代清楚
    编辑同志：前中共河北省沧县地委书记甘春雷（现在华北民族事务委员会工作）在沧县地委会工作时，曾骗取银行贷款三千万元，挪用党校和干部修养所修建费七亿元，从事机关生产。甘春雷每月请客就要开支二、三百万元。去年夏天开跳舞会，他专门训练了一批勤务人员，替跳舞的人递西瓜、接西瓜皮、递手巾，并规定不得乱了次序，妨碍跳舞。他到建国县去检查工作，前三天就通知建国县委修理汽车站，以便迎接他。在调动工作前，他拿了机关生产款一千万元，买了西药、纸烟、皮箱等物带走，并带走了机关里一些值钱的东西。甘春雷和刘青山、张子善过去互相送礼，也有许多纠缠不清的事。现在中共沧县地委的党员纷纷要求中共河北省委调回甘春雷，让他把他的贪污、浪费、官僚主义的问题交代清楚。我认为这些意见是正确的。

    魏国、高青山在丰南工作时有严重的贪污腐化行为
    前中共河北省丰南县委书记魏国、县长高青山等，利用职权，把县委开办的民生货栈和两个工厂（主要经营猪鬃业），变为他们少数人的财产。魏国派了他的弟弟小孟和亲戚安某做两个工厂的经理。他们用“特费开支”名义买毛毯、皮大衣、钢笔、手表。有的县委还替老婆买手表。他们每个人的日用穿戴，就花费了一千万元以上。县青委书记王云波因为不愿和他们同流合污，反对他们这种非法行为，就遭到他们的打击。他们在男女关系上，表现得极不严肃。魏国和宣传部长石光把一个有政治问题的女收音员介绍给高青山做爱人，并发展她为党员，严重地丧失了党的原则。由于县委领导同志手脚不干净，就助长了区干部的贪污现象。如五区区长和区委书记合伙贪污预购粮、救济粮、贷麦粮、河工粮等。其他地区贪污现象也极严重。当地党委应迅速处理。

    山西太原市有关领导方面
    应严惩拒不坦白的贪污分子李文杰
    编辑同志：山西太原市公营新生建筑公司的领导人李文杰贪污浪费，又拒不坦白。李文杰为要在国家建设工程中偷窃资财，曾向山西建设局监工员曹济民（现已潜逃）行贿过好几千斤小米。一九五○年下半年，中共太原市委派人调查这个公司的资金时，他又少报了一部分资金。他用隐瞒的资金买了一部小汽车。在生活方面，他已腐化到每餐必有鸡鸭鱼肉、无酒不能下咽的地步。他恐怕将来有人暴露他的罪恶行为，更换了好几名通讯员。在这个公司结业时，李文杰怕干部说闲话，又用分赃的办法，发给每人半月到一月半的工薪。对这些罪恶行为，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中他拒不坦白。我希望有关方面严厉惩处李文杰。

    燕京大学有严重的浪费现象
    编辑同志：燕京大学最近召开了一个大会，会上陆志韦校长对官僚主义作风作了检讨，师生们揭发了学校内严重浪费和官僚主义的现象。大家认为陆志韦的检讨不深刻，要求他重作检讨，他已答应再深刻检讨。会上揭发了庶务课在六个仓库里积压的物资价值五亿元以上，其中有价值三亿元以上的白报纸四百四十三箱，还有维生素丸、钙片、钢丝绷带及药棉等大批药品。去年，在发动抗美援朝捐献时，同学和职工都曾主张把这些物资捐给志愿军，但是庶务课王汉章主任竟说没有。同学们听到了这个事情以后都非常气愤。在仓库中又发现三个降落伞，两个已经被耗子咬坏。这些物品都是人民的宝贵财物，怎能容许这样糟蹋！在清点旧穆楼仓库时，发现还保存着国民党反动派的旗帜，试问我们的仓库是为谁服务的，为什么要留着这些东西？农场有一千多棵果树，但是农场场长范翊华灵机一动就开动拖拉机翻土（他说“想让工人见识见识拖拉机”），结果，把其中的八百二十六棵果树都搞死了，使人民损失了约三亿九千多万元。农场拆房屋，把木头随便堆在场地上，不加保护，今天这些木头都变成粉末了。工程课买石灰一百吨，只用六十吨，剩下四十吨，其中有三万斤因被雨水冲洗不能用了。材料厂的账目只有百分之一、二是对的，其余的不是伪造就是残缺不全。庶务课的账目也乱七八糟。丢煤的事情也常发生，两年来丢了四十六吨煤。群众听了，都按捺不住了，纷纷要求彻底查办和上述事情有关的人员王汉章等人。

    女儿帮助我坦白了贪污罪行
    我是山西省邮电管理局市话科营业股股长。以前担任审核工作时，我曾经涂改收据八次，贪污公款一百多万元。
    我在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，听了报告，学习了文件，初步认识了这一运动的政策。再听了本单位负责同志在大会上的自我检讨后，我想到要把自己所有的问题谈出来。但我怕“连累”别人，怕被送法院，怕家庭生活没办法等等。我又想，我贪污，只是我一人知道；不谈，别人也不会揭发出来。我和同事侯铸合伙贪污的问题，只要他不谈，我不谈，谁也不会知道。或者，看看情况再谈。我采取了一种等待、观望、试探的态度，企图“滑”过去。可是，一个心怀鬼胎的人，不论言语、行动，总是表现得不自然。一天回家，我女儿贾育琴（青年团员）见我神色不对，她就说我思想上必定有问题。她拿起山西日报让我看，并对我说：“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动是和资产阶级的腐朽堕落思想作尖锐斗争的伟大运动；也是救人救己的良好机会。”我听了女儿的话，看了报以后，心里非常难过。我又想到，我和同事侯铸约定不谈自己的问题，是对抗反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的行为，也是罪上加罪的行为。我情不自禁地流了泪。我吃不下饭，睡不着觉。那天半夜里两三点钟的时候，我叫起我的女儿和爱人，谈了我一连串的贪污问题。她们要我把问题向组织上全部谈出。我有了勇气和决心。第二天，我向组织上谈了我的问题。但是与侯铸合秋贪污的事，我还是没有谈。我认为“连累”别人的事，最好不要谈。回家后，我女儿知道了我坦白的情况。她郑重其事地对我说：“您这简直是自找死路。要知道，谈出您和侯铸的问题，才是对侯铸帮助；您不应该害人自害。”这一下才把我的思想打通。第三天，我向组织上交代了我的所有的问题后，领导同志在大会上宣布不处分我。
    这样，我怎能不受感动呢？我没有别的话说。今后，我一定要从新做人，努力做好工作来回答毛主席、共产党对我的宽大。

    德州专署所属某些机关单位
    经费管理不严造成浪费现象
    编辑同志：山东省德州专署财政科在检查各机关单位经费管理时，发现有些机关单位执行制度不认真，工作计划不周密，严重地浪费了国家资财。专署财政科在去年印制征收农业税表册时，只贪图工作方便，不按制度，也不进行详细调查就付印，结果多印了七万六千八百多份，浪费了国家资财二千五百多万元。专署所属利华制油轧花厂，在基本建设工程中，计划不周，中途变工，不按程序办事，以致超出了原来预算一亿四千四百万元。轧花厂在支用超出费用时，也不作出追补预算，不经上级批准，就擅自挪用流动资金，因而影响了生产。其他方面，如开会时铺张浪费的数字也很大。计全专区从去年一月到十月，在开会招待方面的浪费，共达八千五百多万元。
    浪费的主要原因，是财政制度混乱和有关部门领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风。我希望德州专署今后切实加强对所属各单位的领导，改善和监督这些单位的经费管理工作。
