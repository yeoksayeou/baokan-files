    Guarantee Smooth Frontline Communications with Bravery and Wisdom
    Returned Representative of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Yuan Jiguang
    In mountainous and watery Korea, once summer arrives, the rain never stops, often lasting for ten days to half a month. At night, it's as dark as ink, you can't even see your palm when you hold out your hand. The Second Platoon (telephone platoon) of the command company of a certain artillery unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers, on such dark and rainy nights, walked on muddy and slippery mountain roads, following their unit, crossing mountains and ridges, advancing to the front lines.

    During the long march, they waded through water and climbed mountains, their clothes and socks constantly wet. Upon reaching their destination, some had swollen feet, others had diarrhea, and nearly one-fifth of the platoon were sick. But illness only eroded their bodies, not their iron will. Squad leader Li Liming's leg was swollen very thickly, and Private Wang Shengxiang's arm had already become infected, while Wang Bokun had been suffering from diarrhea for several days, but they all stubbornly persisted in their work. The more difficult and arduous the environment, the more tenacious they appeared.

    In July 1951, one afternoon, they reached their camp. As soon as they put down their backpacks, without resting, without eating, and without even finding a place to live, they began to carry out the task of laying lines. They didn't speak the language, and they weren't familiar with the geography, but they had the determination to complete the mission. During the line laying, some fell into mountain gullies, and some rolled down hillsides, but they overcame the difficulties through climbing mountains and crossing rivers, and successfully completed the task of laying thirty li of lines before midnight. When they returned, it was pitch black and raining, they couldn't find their garrison, so they lay under a truck until dawn.

    The tasks became increasingly urgent and numerous. They ran out of insulated wire, but one line-laying task after another was passed down. "If we ask the higher authorities for materials at this critical time, it will inevitably affect the execution of combat missions, what should we do?" This was the problem that Platoon Leader Liu Qiming and Deputy Platoon Leader Shi Xiaohuai were eager to solve. They called a "Zhuge Liang meeting" of squad and team leaders, and everyone brainstormed and came up with ideas. As a result, it was decided to use the high-voltage copper and iron wires damaged by enemy shells on the front line in reverse, to erect overhead lines; and to use broken rubber shoes and tires to replace insulating magnetic heads. After the decision, they divided into groups and went to find them separately. Braving enemy fire, they carried the wire back from the front line (each piece was about one hundred and fifty meters long and weighed more than two hundred catties, which could be reversed into nineteen small pieces). Then, everyone divided the work, some burying poles, some laying lines, reversing the wire while laying it, and quickly completed the task.

    Once, Communist Party member Liu Shuangmao led Xu Binglong and five others to wade across the Han River, which was chest-deep, to lay lines to an advanced observation post. While crossing the river, Xu Binglong was knocked down by the rapids and swallowed two mouthfuls of water. But he held on tightly to the equipment and didn't let go. After crossing the river, they were met with the enemy's frenzied artillery fire blocking the road, shells exploding with loud noises, and smoke and fire intertwined on the road. Communist Party member Liu Shuangmao shouted: "Connecting the line will annihilate the enemy! Our opportunity to perform meritorious service for the motherland has arrived!" He ran forward releasing the wire, and everyone followed him. They laid the line alertly amidst the exploding shell flashes and rising columns of sand. Planes circled overhead, sometimes strafing with machine guns. But courage overcame the enemy's threat, and in seven days and seven nights, they climbed more than a dozen mountain peaks, laying a total of more than one hundred and twenty li of overhead copper wire.

    The lines were laid, but they were often broken by intense artillery fire. The places where the lines were frequently broken were also the places where the most shells landed, so checking and protecting the lines became the arduous task of the Second Platoon. Communist Party member Sang Fu was connecting the line when a shell landed right next to him, covering him with dirt. He was so focused on completing the task that he didn't even realize that he had been grazed by shrapnel on the head until he returned after completing the task. Li Haijing and Xu Xiaode went to check the line, and two shells landed three or four meters away from them. Xu Xiaode climbed up and said: "As long as someone is here, we are sure to complete the task."

    Planes and artillery shells could not stop the brave telephone operators of the Second Platoon from completing their tasks. They raced against time, fearlessly sacrificing and bleeding to check and protect the lines. In the tense work process, they were so busy that they couldn't eat well, drink water, or sleep. They once slept only eleven hours in six days and six nights. Twice, they only ate one meal in two days, but their spirits were high because they had successfully completed the glorious task entrusted to them by the people.

    In half a month, they collected more than 115,000 meters of copper and iron wire; picked up more than 2,000 pairs of broken rubber shoes and three and a half broken tires; used more than 1,800 poles, successfully connecting a communications network of more than 230 li, guaranteeing the completion of combat missions, and the entire platoon was awarded the Second Class Merit.

    用英勇和智慧保证前线电讯畅通
    中国人民志愿军归国代表  袁纪光
    在多山多水的朝鲜，一到了夏季，雨下起来没完，常常十天半月不止。晚上，天黑得像墨，伸出手来连手掌都看不见。志愿军某炮兵部队的指挥连二排（电话排），在这样漆黑的雨夜里，走着泥泞溜滑的山路，随着他们的部队，翻山越岭，向前线挺进。
    他们在长途行军中，涉水、爬山，衣服鞋袜整天不能干。到达目的地后，有的脚肿，有的拉痢，全排病号几乎占了五分之一。可是病只侵蚀了他们的肉体，却侵蚀不了他们钢铁的意志。班长李立明腿肿得很粗，战士王升祥的胳膊已肿得化脓，王伯昆拉痢好几天了，但他们都顽强地坚持工作。愈是在艰难困苦的环境中，他们就愈显得顽强。
    一九五一年七月间，有一天下午，他们达到宿营地，刚放下背包，没休息，没吃饭，连住的地方还没有找到，就开始执行架线任务。他们语言不通，地理不熟，但他们有着一颗完成任务的决心。在架线工作中，他们有的掉到山沟里，有的滚到山坡下，爬山过河，终于克服了困难，不到半夜就胜利地完成了三十华里的架线任务。回来时，天一片漆黑，又下着雨，他们找不到驻地，就躺在汽车下等到天明。
    任务越来越紧，也越来越多，携带的被覆线用完了，但架线的任务仍一个跟一个传下来。“如果在这个紧促的时间里，向上级去要材料，必定要影响战斗任务的执行，怎么办？”这是排长刘启明、副排长石小槐所急于解决的问题。他们召集班组长开了个“诸葛亮会”，大家动脑子，想办法。结果，决定用在第一线被敌人炮弹打坏的高压铜线和铁线倒开来，架高空的电线；用破胶鞋破轮胎代替绝缘磁头。决定后，他们就以组为单位分头去找。他们冒着敌人的炮火，从第一线将线抬回来（每根长约一百五十公尺，重二百多斤，可倒成十九小根）。接着，大家就分工动手，埋杆的埋杆，架线的架线，一面倒线一面架，很快地完成了任务。
    有一次，共产党员刘双茂带着徐炳龙等五个人，涉过水深齐胸的汉江，向前进观测所架线。过江时，徐炳龙被激流冲倒，喝了两口水。但他紧紧握着器材并没有松手。过江后，正值敌人的疯狂炮火封锁着这条路，炮弹在轰鸣爆炸，路上烟火交织。党员刘双茂喊着：“架通线就可以歼灭敌人！我们为祖国立功的机会到了！”他放着线向前跑去，大家也都跟随跑上去。他们在迸发的弹光和腾起的沙柱中，机警地架着线。飞机在头顶上盘旋，有时还打机枪。但勇敢战胜了敌人的威胁，他们在七天七夜中，爬了十几个山头，共架了一百二十多里的高空铜线。
    线架好了，但经常被激烈的炮火炸断。线常断的地方，也是落炮弹最多的地方，所以查线、护线也就成了二排的艰巨任务。共产党员桑甫在接线时，一发炮弹正落在他身旁，泥土盖满了全身，他专心于完成任务，头上被弹片擦破了还不知道，直到完成任务回来才发觉。李海静和徐孝德去查线，两发炮弹落在距他们三、四公尺处，徐孝德爬起来说：“只要有人在，保险完成任务。”
    飞机、炮弹，都阻止不住英勇的二排电话员完成任务的决心。他们争取一分一秒的时间，不怕牺牲流血地去查线、护线。在紧张的工作过程中，忙得饭吃不好，水喝不上，觉睡不了。他们曾有六天六夜仅睡十一个钟头的觉。有两次，两天只吃了一顿饭，但他们的精神是愉快的，因为他们胜利地完成了人民交给他们的光荣任务。
    他们在半月内，共收集了铜线和铁线十一万五千余公尺；拣破胶鞋两千余双，破轮胎三个半；用杆子一千八百余根，胜利地构通了二百三十余里的通讯网，保证了作战任务的完成，全排荣获二等功。
