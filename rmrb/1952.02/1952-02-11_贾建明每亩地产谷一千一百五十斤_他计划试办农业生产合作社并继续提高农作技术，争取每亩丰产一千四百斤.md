Hebei Province Daming County labor model Jia Jianming harvested 1,150 jin of millet per mu last year. Jia Jianming is a young labor model, and the mutual aid group he leads is also a model mutual aid group. Last spring, when Hebei Province launched the patriotic bumper harvest campaign, Jia Jianming decided to learn from the experience of the famous labor model Zhang Xishun in growing millet. He selected 1.7 mu of irrigable cultivated land for a millet bumper harvest experiment, and it was successful. Jia Jianming's experience in growing millet mainly includes the following points:

(1) Combining land preparation, base fertilizer application, and pest control: The 1.7 mu of millet bumper harvest experimental land he selected was previously planted with peanuts, resulting in many fallen leaves. After harvesting the peanuts the year before last, he used a seven-inch walking plow to deeply plow the land (about seven inches) once, turning the fallen leaves into the soil. Then, he harrowed it once to reduce the soil clumps and better facilitate weathering. When the ground froze, he plowed it again, five inches deep. This not only prevented the peanut leaves from being turned up again but also caused the hibernating pests and their eggs and pupae to be turned to the surface and frozen to death. After plowing, ridges and ditches were made to facilitate the accumulation of rain and snow. After the thaw last spring, he first harrowed the land to break up the soil clumps. Then, he mixed 150 jin of soybean cake, 140 jin of dried manure, 15 jin of millet bran, and two large cartloads of pen manure evenly and spread them on the land, followed by another harrowing. Why is it necessary to spread the base fertilizer evenly? He said: The roots of millet are different from those of cotton; millet roots have more fibers and spread far horizontally. Spreading the fertilizer evenly allows the millet roots to absorb it fully. Harrowing after spreading manure is to mix the manure and soil to prevent the manure from being blown away by the wind. After applying the base fertilizer, he used a plow with the moldboard removed to plow the land shallowly again, followed by two harrowings. After that, he harrowed it every ten days or so. He said: Harrowing the land is like changing clothes for people—comfortable, relaxed, and energetic. Harrowing it several times can rest the land and conserve moisture. When applying the base fertilizer, he also crushed eight jin of eggshells, burned them, and mixed them with cotton oil, spreading them on the land to prevent mole crickets.

(2) Combining sowing and disaster prevention: The millet seeds he used were Huanong No. 4 millet, which were selected from the field the year before last by ear selection. Before sowing last year, he also soaked the seeds in warm water at a ratio of "two parts boiling water to one part cold water." This can not only prevent black穗 disease but also float out the shriveled and thin grains, leaving only the plump seeds. He sowed his millet three days after the Grain Rain solar term, which was more than ten days earlier than the local general spring millet sowing time. The purpose of doing this is to advance the flowering period of the millet and avoid the rainy season because if the millet flowering period coincides with the rainy season, there will be many unripe grains, which will reduce production.

(3) Applying topdressing fertilizer and irrigating appropriately and timely: He applied topdressing fertilizer twice to his millet field. The first time was when the millet seedlings were one foot three or four inches tall. He applied three cartloads of kang soil, followed by a large watering, which made the seedlings grow quickly. The second time was before the millet eared, when he applied fifteen jin of fertilizer powder and watered it again to ensure the fertilizer supply during the millet flowering period. He also watered the millet field in moderation. To prevent spring drought from affecting millet emergence, he watered it once before sowing the millet. When the millet emerged, the weather was also dry, but he did not water it immediately. He waited until the millet seedlings grew to three inches tall before irrigating with a small amount of water. He believes that small seedlings are like small children and should undergo some hardship from an early age that does not harm their health to make the roots strong, so they will grow strong in the future. Therefore, the first watering should be small, just enough to moisten the soil and prevent the seedlings from dying of drought. After this watering, it was not until the millet grew to one foot three or four inches tall that he watered it heavily in conjunction with the application of topdressing fertilizer. When the millet stalks grew to three feet tall, he watered it again heavily in conjunction with the application of topdressing fertilizer. The reason why these two waterings need to be large is that the millet needs more water when it is larger, the weather is hot and evaporation is fast, and the large amount of water can also make the fertilizer decompose quickly and be absorbed by the crops. His method of appropriately supplying water and nutrients according to the needs of crop growth is in line with scientific principles.

(4) Sparse ridges and dense planting for seedlings, and appropriate depth for weeding: He used a plow to open the ditches and sowed the seeds by hand along the ditches. The advantage of this is that the row spacing can be adjusted appropriately. The row spacing of his millet is one foot five inches and one foot two inches, alternating with each other, which is both conducive to ventilation and light transmission and conducive to cultivation management. Because Huanong No. 4 millet has very few branches, his millet field is very densely planted, with two rows of seedlings left in one ridge, with a plant spacing of about two fingers; the number of seedlings per mu is about 40,000. When thinning seedlings, he pulled out weak seedlings and unhealthy seedlings with yellow leaves, leaving healthy seedlings, and at the same time pulled out weeds. He thinned the seedlings twice, and after each thinning, he hoeed shallowly to loosen the soil. When the seedlings were three inches tall, he hoeed the third time, a little deeper than the previous two times; when the seedlings were one foot three or four inches tall, he hoeed the deepest, about two inches. After that, he hoeed from deep to shallow to avoid damaging the millet roots. When the millet ears, the millet leaves overlap and fill the ridges, so there is no need to hoe again. He hoeed the land in the afternoon. His experience is that hoeing millet in the morning is not good because there is dew, and touching the millet leaves will turn the leaves yellow, which is not good for the seedlings. Hoeing in the afternoon is best. In addition, in addition to effectively mastering the pest control policy of prevention being more important than treatment and carrying out a series of disease and pest prevention work, he can also achieve immediate treatment of pests and diseases when they are discovered, so as not to spread them. For example, when his millet grew to three feet tall, he suddenly found stem borers, so he quickly pulled out a dozen millet stalks with stem borers to prevent the spread of the stem borers.

Jia Jianming's method of millet bumper harvest is worthy of universal promotion, but his bumper harvest has not yet reached its peak. First of all, Jia Jianming's bumper harvest land is a relatively barren white sandy soil. If more decomposed organic fertilizers such as grass manure and pen manure can be applied to increase the organic matter content in the soil, the land fertility will be improved and production will be increased better. Secondly, the fertilizer powder used for topdressing is a nitrogen fertilizer, which is not as effective as phosphorus fertilizer in promoting millet flowering and seed setting. Before millet flowering and seed setting, fast-acting phosphorus fertilizer (such as superphosphate) should be applied. If chronic phosphorus fertilizer is used, it should be applied early, or the phosphorus content in the base fertilizer should be increased so that the millet can get enough phosphorus fertilizer during the flowering period. Thirdly, during the inspection and treatment of stem borers, one less hoeing was done due to poor labor allocation, which is also a disadvantage for millet bumper harvest. In the future, if planning can be further strengthened in the mutual aid group to make labor allocation more scientific, cultivation techniques can continue to be improved, and output can continue to increase.

    贾建明每亩地产谷一千一百五十斤
    他计划试办农业生产合作社并继续提高农作技术，争取每亩丰产一千四百斤
    河北省大名县劳动模范贾建明，去年所种的谷子每亩产谷一千一百五十斤。贾建明是一位青年劳动模范，他领导的互助组也是个模范互助组。去年春季河北省开展爱国丰产运动时，贾建明决心学习著名劳动模范张希顺种谷子的经验，选择了一亩七分能浇的耕地作谷子丰产试验，结果成功了。贾建明种谷的经验主要有以下几点：
    （一）整地、施基肥和防虫相结合：他所选择的一亩七分谷子丰产试验地，前作是花生，落叶很多。前年收花生后，他曾用七吋步犁将地深耕（约七寸）了一次，把落叶翻下土去，然后耙一次，使土块变小，更好地起风化作用。地冻时又翻耕一次，五寸深，这样不但花生叶子不致再翻上来，而且使已经蛰居的害虫和害虫的卵蛹，被翻上地面冻死。翻土后作成垅沟，便于积存雨雪。去年开春后刚化冻，他就先把地耙了一遍，耙碎土块，然后将一百五十斤豆饼、一百四十斤大粪干、十五斤谷糠和两大车圈粪混合均匀撒在地里，再耙一次。为什么基肥要普撒呢？他说：谷根和棉根不同，谷根须多，横着爬的远，将肥料撒匀，可使谷根充分吸收；撒粪后耙一遍是为了使粪和土搀匀，以免粪被风刮走。上基肥后他用去掉犁镜子的犁再把地浅耕一遍，耙两次；以后每隔十来天耙一次。他说：耙地跟人换衣裳一样，舒服松快精神足，多耙几次，能歇地保墒。在上基肥的时候，他还将八斤鸡蛋皮捣碎烧胡，掺上棉油，一同撒到地里，用来防治蝼蛄。
    （二）播种和防灾相结合：他用的谷种华农四号谷，是前年在田间穗选的。去年播种前又用“两开对一凉”的温汤浸了种。这样既可防治黑穗病，又可漂出秕瘦的籽粒，留下饱满的种子。他的谷子是在谷雨后三天下种的，比当地一般春谷早种十几天。这样作的目的是使谷子的扬花期提前，躲开雨季。因为谷子扬花时赶上雨季，不熟的谷粒多，就会减产。
    （三）适时施追肥、适时适量灌水：他的谷地共施追肥两次，第一次是在谷苗高一尺三、四寸时，施了三车炕土，接着浇了一次大水，使苗很快长起来；第二次是在谷子抽穗前施了十五斤肥田粉，又浇了一次大水，保证了谷子开花时的肥分供应。他给谷地灌水也有分寸。为怕春旱影响谷子出苗，他在谷子下种前曾浇了一次水。当谷子出苗后天气也旱，但他没有立即浇水，等到谷苗长到三寸高时他才灌一次小水。他认为：小苗和小孩子一样，从小就应受些不妨害健康的艰苦锻炼，使根扎好，将来长起来就壮，所以，初次浇小水，接上湿土使苗旱不死就行。这次浇水后，一直要到谷子长到一尺三、四寸高时，配合施追肥，才浇一次大水，谷稞长到三尺高时，又配合施追肥浇一次大水。这两次水量要大的原因，是谷子大了需水量多，天气热蒸发快，同时水大了才能使肥料分解的快，很快地被庄稼吸收。他这种根据作物生长的需要，适当供应水分和养料的办法，是合乎科学道理的。
    （四）留苗是稀垅密株，锄地是深浅适宜：他是用犁开沟，用手顺沟撒种籽的办法下种的。这样作的好处是行距可以适当调节。他的谷子的行距，有一尺五寸和一尺二寸两种互相间隔，既便于通风透光，又便于中耕管理。因为华农四号谷分杈很少，所以他的谷地留苗很密，在一垅里留两行苗，株距二指左右；每亩苗数约四万棵。间苗时，他都把弱苗和叶色发黄的不健康的苗拔去，留下健康苗，同时拔去杂草。他共间两次苗，每次间苗后就浅锄一次松土。苗高三寸时，锄第三次，较前两次稍深；苗高一尺三、四寸时，锄的最深，约二寸，以后锄时就由深到浅，以免伤害谷根。谷子抽穗时，谷叶相搭已满垅，不必再锄。他锄地都在过午时分，他的经验是早晨锄谷子，因为有露水，碰谷叶后，叶子变黄，对苗不利。过午锄最好。此外，他除切实掌握了防重于治的除虫方针并进行了一系列的预防病虫害的工作外，还能作到发现虫害立即除治，不使蔓延。如当他的谷子长到三尺高时，忽然发现了钻心虫，他就连忙将十几棵有钻心虫的谷棵拔去，防止了钻心虫的蔓延。
    贾建明的谷子丰产办法，是值得普遍推广的，但是他的丰产还未达到顶点。首先，贾建明的丰产地是比较瘠薄的白沙土质，如能多施草粪、圈粪等腐熟有机质肥料，增多土壤中的有机质成分，就会提高地力，更好地增加生产。其次，他追肥所用的肥田粉，是氮素肥料，对于促使谷子开花结籽的效能不如磷质肥料。在谷子开花结籽以前应施以速效的磷质肥料（如过磷酸石灰），如用的是慢性磷质肥料就应早施，或增加基肥中的磷质成分，使谷子开花期间能得到充分的磷肥。第三，在检查和除治钻心虫时，因劳力调配的不好，少锄一遍，对于谷子丰产也是一个不利的因素。今后如能在互助组里再加强计划性，使劳力分配得更科学，耕作技术仍可继续提高，产量也可以继续增加。
    贾建明计划在一九五二年的爱国丰产运动中，试办农业生产合作社，继续提高农作技术，为争取每亩谷子丰产一千四百斤，并带动全村一百四十五个青年为达到每亩增产五十斤到六十斤粮食而努力。
