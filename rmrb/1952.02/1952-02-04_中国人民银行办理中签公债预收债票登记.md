The second lottery for the principal repayment of the first phase of the 1950 People's Victory Parity Unit Public Bonds was held in Beijing on the 1st. Public bond holders whose bond numbers have the same last two digits as the winning numbers announced by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government can, from March 31st, present their bonds to the People's Bank of China to receive the principal and accrued interest. Public bonds that did not win can also be presented to the People's Bank of China to receive the full year's interest.

To reduce crowding when paying out the principal and interest of public bonds starting on March 31st, local People's Banks will conduct preliminary acceptance of winning bonds in advance. Bondholders can submit their winning bonds to the local People's Bank in advance, and the bank will issue a pre-collection bond receipt, with the principal and interest paid upon maturity. Government agencies, factories, schools, and organizations can collect collectively.

According to reports from various locations, some people who purchased public bonds in 1950 have not yet exchanged their temporary receipts for bond tickets because their mailing addresses have changed, or they have lost their temporary receipts. These people can still present their temporary receipts to the People's Bank to exchange for bond tickets, or apply for loss reporting and receive the principal and interest due.

Further investigation reveals that when the public bonds were issued, a few lawbreakers collected money from bond purchasers but did not remit the funds to the state treasury, nor did they issue bond tickets to the purchasers. Currently, a vigorous campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is underway nationwide. Anyone who did pay the money but did not receive a public bond can report the lawbreakers who embezzled the bond funds to the government.

    中国人民银行  
    办理中签公债预收债票登记
    一九五零年第一期人民胜利折实公债第二次还本抽签已于一日在北京举行，凡公债债券号码末尾二字和中央人民政府财政部公布的中签号码相同的，公债持有人都可以从三月三十一日起，凭票向人民银行领还本金和应得的利息；没有中签的公债票，也可以凭票向人民银行领取应得的全年利息。
    各地人民银行为了减少持票人在三月三十一日开始兑付公债本息时的拥挤，在三月三十一日以前，将预先办理中签债票的验收工作，公债持票人，可将中签债票预先交到当地人民银行，由银行出给预收债票凭证，到期给付本息。机关、工厂、学校、团体可集体兑领。
    中国人民银行最近根据各地报告，各地还有少数在一九五零年购买公债的人，因为通讯地址变动，又未向人民银行领取债票，或者遗失了临时收据，至今还没有换领债票的，这些人仍可凭临时收据，向人民银行换领债票，或者向人民银行办理挂失手续和领取应得的本息。
    另据调查，在发行公债时，有少数不法分子，向购债人收了钱，但是没有向国库交款，也没有发给购债人债票。现在全国正在热烈地展开反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动，凡确是缴了钱，而没有领到公债票的人，都可向政府检举吞没债款的不法分子。
