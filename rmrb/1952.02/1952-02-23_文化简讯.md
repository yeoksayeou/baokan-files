Cultural Briefs

    ▲ The third issue of "China Youth" for 1952 was published on February 20th. This issue features the "Basic Knowledge Textbook for the Youth League" (draft) compiled by the China Youth Publishing House and the Propaganda Department of the North China Working Committee of the Youth League. This textbook is based on the "Outline for Lectures on 'Basic Knowledge of the Youth League'" issued by the Central Committee of the Youth League in November 1951, and is divided into eleven lessons (the original Outline's second and sixth lessons are each divided into two lessons). This issue publishes the first five lessons, and the remaining lessons will be published in the next issue.

    This textbook can be used as a reference for study counselors when lecturing on League lessons to young workers and farmers who are League members, and can also be used as a self-study reader for League members with junior high school education or above. The publication of this textbook should be given attention by youth league organizations in various regions.

    The central content of this issue is still to cooperate with the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, focusing on clarifying the boundaries between bourgeois and proletarian ideology.

    ▲ The Economy Inspection Committee of Beijing Higher Education Institutions is hosting an anti-waste exhibition of Beijing's higher education institutions at the North Building of Peking University. Participating institutions include: Peking University, Peking University Medical College, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Yenching University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Beijing Institute of Technology, Northern Jiaotong University, Peking Union Medical College, and Beijing Agricultural University.

Visiting hours are from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM daily. The exhibition will last for approximately one week.
