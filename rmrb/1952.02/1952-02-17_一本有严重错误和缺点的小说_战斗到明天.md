    A Novel with Serious Errors and Shortcomings – “Fighting Till Tomorrow”
    Yuan Shuibai
    By Bai Ren, Published by the Political Department of the Central South Military Region, 1951
    From the numerous readers' letters to the "People's Daily," it is evident that readers agree with the "People's Daily's" brief critique of the chapter "Bloody Battle of Tianmen Peak" in "Fighting Till Tomorrow," and they have raised many correct opinions about the novel itself. From these letters, a noteworthy situation also emerges: readers in the military with remnants of petty-bourgeois ideology highly welcome this work. There are reactions such as: "After reading it, they praise it unanimously, some even read it two or three times." "They read it eagerly, savoring every word... drilling into the depths of the petty-bourgeois soul." This situation itself is enough to demonstrate the necessity of conducting a serious critique of "Fighting Till Tomorrow."
    The errors and shortcomings of "Fighting Till Tomorrow" are serious. It distorts historical truth, distorts the people's army and the leadership of the Party, and replaces the leadership of the working class with that of the petty bourgeoisie. In many places, the author demonstrates serious errors by deviating from the standpoint of the working class, the standpoint of the people, and the standpoint of the nation, and instead standing on the standpoint of the petty bourgeoisie, the reactionary standpoint of the bourgeoisie, and the standpoint of the enemy.
    Why do certain petty-bourgeois intellectuals welcome this book? Because its content caters to the tastes of the petty bourgeoisie; it stubbornly expresses and eulogizes the petty bourgeoisie, promotes petty-bourgeois thoughts and feelings, and excuses and appreciates their shortcomings; it disseminates a large amount of vulgar, low-level, and even obscene tastes of the petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, this book lacks educational significance and is even harmful to both workers, peasants, and soldiers, as well as to petty-bourgeois intellectuals.
    The novel is set during the War of Resistance Against Japan, from 1942 until Japan's surrender, and depicts the anti-"mopping-up" war waged by a detachment of the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army in the Lunan enemy rear base area. The main characters in the book are three or five people from the Propaganda Section of the political department of this detachment, who were of petty-bourgeois intellectual origin and later became political and deputy political instructors of a company. Judging from the author's own declared theme of the book, he seems to want to create several intellectual role models who are integrated with workers, peasants, and soldiers; to describe how they transformed themselves through the severe test of war and became excellent cadres in the revolutionary ranks; and to educate readers with the struggle experience of these typical figures. Has this goal been achieved? No. Moreover, whether the author's purpose in writing this novel is indeed this way is also highly questionable.
    The corner of the Lunan enemy rear base area that the author writes about lacks typical significance. It is insufficient to represent the entire anti-Japanese base area in Shandong at that time and cannot give people a correct understanding of the historical environment at that time. The author emphasizes the portrayal of local dark sides and mistakenly transplants some shortcomings of the guerrillas in the early stages of the war of resistance, before 1942, to after 1942, causing a confusion of historical stages. The impression the author gives of the base area is bleak and backward. Our troops are not strong enough, we are frequently attacked and invaded by the enemy, frequently transfer and fail, and fail in a very embarrassing manner. These descriptions cannot reflect the face of the entire Shandong Liberated Area (including the Bohai, Binhai, Jiaodong, Luzhong, Luxi, and Lunan military regions), which had been greatly developed after 1942, and of course, cannot give readers the impression that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army led by the Chinese Communist Party were flourishing, growing stronger in battle, opening up more than a dozen liberated areas across the country, creating countless brilliant achievements, containing and resisting the vast majority of the Japanese invaders in China, and laying the foundation for future victory. Readers cannot see the overall victorious situation from this corner, cannot see that this is one of the brightest regions in China, and that a new China is being nurtured from this and other similar regions.
    The author distorts the enemy rear base area, distorts historical truth. But these are actually not what the author intended to express; what he wants to express is three or five intellectual cadres. They are the focus of the author's attention, they are the protagonists of the novel, and also the protagonists of history. Other characters, military cadres of worker, peasant, and soldier origin, become supporting roles instead. The battles of the troops also become the background of the picture. Several chapters in the book simply explain the current war situation in the base area at the beginning or end, and then devote most of the space to describing the activities and ideological feelings of these intellectual cadres in their small world. Of course, this does not mean that petty-bourgeois intellectuals cannot be portrayed as protagonists in any literary work, but rather that it depends on the author's attitude and position in portraying them, and what position they are placed in. Is it writing about how they transform from one class to another? Or is it writing about how they can remain worthy of affirmation without transforming? Although Comrade Bai Ren describes how these intellectuals have undergone a lot of training and differentiated: some have degenerated, some have advanced; but it is rarely explained which shortcomings those who have advanced have overcome, and how they have overcome them. Why they can be unyielding in the enemy's prison, and why they can fight bravely on the battlefield, are not correctly explained with sufficient persuasiveness. Even wrong explanations are made, as if their tenacity and determination are due to their inherent nature, or personal strength, rather than the Party's education and cultivation and the improvement of their own political consciousness. Not only is their transformation process extremely unclear, but whether they have transformed well or not is also questionable. Their thinking does not undergo any fundamental change in the end. On the contrary, their petty-bourgeois inferiority, their sense of superiority, individualism, liberalism, and their petty-bourgeois outlook on life, still do not change much in the end, and these seem not to affect their fighting and progress. Therefore, rather than saying that the author really wants to write about the transformation of the petty bourgeoisie, it is better to say that the author simply wants to praise the petty bourgeoisie, and to make unrestrained publicity for their own petty-bourgeois thoughts, as well as for the author's own.
    Let us look at the male protagonist Sha Fei, who the author praises. From the beginning, the author explains that he has a strong sense of personal heroism, but by the end of the book, this shortcoming has not changed much. Sha Fei still demonstrates personal heroism in the last few times he accepts combat missions. It is either said that he "wants to show off his skills," or that he accepts the mission because he "doesn't want to appear incompetent in front of the cadres of the entire company," or because he is "afraid of being called cowardly." When describing the tension of combat, the author still writes without criticism that Sha Fei feels that "the second platoon leader doesn't take him seriously," and therefore "feels greatly humiliated and can't help but secretly get angry." The author either does not criticize these erroneous thoughts, or criticizes them very weakly. Sometimes, he even adopts an appreciative attitude to praise their personal heroism: either writing about how they miraculously capture special agents single-handedly, or writing about how they bravely use bizarre tactics to deceive the enemy and risk attacking enemy bunkers.
    At the end of the novel, the same male protagonist Sha Fei, who should be said to have been transformed, is actually annoyed because he has a scar on his face due to an injury, and thinks that it has damaged his appearance, and feels that he can no longer be worthy of being in love with the female protagonist Lin Xia. His attitude even makes Lin Xia feel "like a terrible claw, wanting to take away her happiness." After Sha Fei's explanation, Lin Xia is relieved, and comforts Sha Fei, and explains that "true beauty is not necessarily in appearance." Only then is our male protagonist persuaded. Isn't this a completely petty-bourgeois trivial farce? And the author actually praises this.
    Such petty-bourgeois intellectuals cannot become good role models at all, and cannot represent the many excellent intellectuals in our Party at all. Although they are of non-proletarian origin, they have been educated by the Party, have undergone countless trainings, have closely integrated with workers, peasants, and soldiers, have transformed their thinking, and have become working-class intellectuals. The author's portrayal of Sha Fei and others as positive characters, as role models, to praise them, is undoubtedly a distortion of China's excellent revolutionary intellectuals.
    The author's non-proletarian standpoint and views also lead to his failure in portraying workers, peasants, and soldiers, and military cadres of worker, peasant, and soldier origin.
    Workers, peasants, and soldiers, and cadres of worker, peasant, and soldier origin, only occupy secondary or unimportant positions in this book. Compared with intellectuals, their faces and thoughts are portrayed in a simple and unvivid way. Moreover, due to the author's preference for the petty bourgeoisie and his unfamiliarity, indifference, observation, and contempt for workers, peasants, and soldiers, their image is greatly distorted and uglified. The author is completely unable to feel and write about their noble qualities and lofty thoughts and feelings. He single-mindedly seeks their shortcomings and backward side, and exaggerates and mocks them without any scruples.
    For example, Wang Chuan, the head of the propaganda section in the book, is a victim in the author's pen. On the one hand, the author introduces him as being of poor peasant origin, a veteran cadre of the Long March, and "progressing quickly under the Party's education." But the specific image is that "when acting in plays, he can't pronounce the lines clearly; when singing, he often changes key; he is too tall, with two crane legs, and is not suitable for dancing, so he has to pull the curtains and carry the wooden sticks for building the stage, doing some odd jobs. Even when he appears on stage, it is only to play minor roles." After Wang Chuan became the head of the propaganda section, he was looked down upon by a group of intellectuals in the section. The author uses their mouths to satirize and ridicule him in various ways: "low cultural level," "doesn't understand literature and art," "a complete bumpkin." The author even makes Wang Chuan feel inferior to them, and feel ashamed of himself, "deeply feeling that he doesn't understand many new things. If he doesn't catch up quickly, he will definitely fall behind." Who is the so-called "catch up quickly" meant to catch up with? Naturally, it is the intellectuals under Wang Chuan, whom the author considers much superior to the worker-peasant-soldier elements, and whose petty-bourgeois inferiority has not been eliminated. In terms of appearance, the author also writes him very ugly, mentioning his long legs several times, calling them "crane legs" and "mantis steps." In contrast, the intellectuals in the author's pen are: the men are "handsome" "good-looking," "ancient knights," and the women are "petrels" and "holy goddesses."
    The author mentions more than once that the dialect of the leading cadres of worker-peasant origin is ridiculous: "a Jiangxi accent," "a strong Hunan accent," "very difficult to understand." When writing about intellectuals, not only are there no such adjectives, but they are praised for having received higher education and for speaking "clear" and pleasant "pure Beijing dialect."
    If the military leading cadres are like this, the ordinary soldiers are naturally written even more unbearably, full of ridiculous situations. The wounded soldiers written by the author are some people without political consciousness, who curse as soon as they open their mouths. He spends a lot of space writing about the story of how two wounded soldiers violated discipline and stole apricots, and how the intellectuals solved the case in the end. This passage can be said to have reached the pinnacle of distorting the image of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and distorting the rear hospital of the Eighth Route Army in this book. That rear hospital is actually written by the author as a completely dark place. The leading cadre is written as a warlord, whose nickname is actually "King of Hell"! Lacking democracy, with no work ability at all. The wounded soldiers talk strangely, and describe the higher authorities of the Eighth Route Army to which the hospital belongs as having serious shortcomings of being divorced from the masses and being bureaucratic, "only looking at work reports," "unwilling to come down and take a look," "it's so comfortable to squat up there." In such a hospital, the author bizarrely fabricates a case of a blind wounded soldier stealing apricots by carrying a legless wounded soldier. They violate discipline without realizing it for a long time. Another soldier, after being suspected, even commits suicide. In the end, it still relies on the intellectual Sha Fei to solve the problem, and also relies on him to help the hospital branch rectify the hospital. The method of rectification is to establish a so-called "progressive association" organization led by Sha Fei, independent of the Party's organization. This is how serious the disregard for the Party's leadership is! In order to praise the protagonist, the intellectual cadre Sha Fei, and to exaggerate his love with another intellectual, Lin Xia, they do not hesitate to ruin the organization of the rear hospital of the Eighth Route Army in every possible way, and wantonly slander it; in order to set off the superiority and ability of the intellectuals, they do not hesitate to write the brave wounded soldiers of the Eighth Route Army as stupid, rude, and undisciplined.
    The author also distorts our army and the leadership of the army.
    Our army is a troop with a high degree of political consciousness, strict discipline, strong combat effectiveness, correct strategic tactics, and good political work. Their relationship with the masses is very close. Especially important is that they are troops led by the Party.
    The author rarely writes about the Party's leadership of the troops, and rarely mentions high-level command. Only once, in the narration of a trivial matter, the name of Comrade Luo Ronghuan, political commissar of the 115th Division, is mentioned incidentally. But mentioning him is not to involve important political events, but only that "Luo Ronghuan is sitting on the playground" "shaving his head" to call on everyone to shave their heads. The author also mentions Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, also about the "shaving heads" "call." The entire book only writes this sentence about "shaving heads" about the senior leadership. The description of this matter is completely inconsistent with the role played by the senior leadership and the Party's leadership in the anti-"mopping-up" war in the enemy rear.
    The author's portrayal of our army's combat seems to frequently not be conducted according to the principles of combat. Victory is not obtained by correctly applying strategic tactics, but by adopting some risky methods by a few people. Bizarre and thrilling battles praised by the author appear more than once in the book. This time it is "fighting with soft methods," and that time it is "difficult to attack strongly," so they still use "other methods." This kind of writing develops to the extreme, which is the battle of Tianmen Peak. Xin Weiqun, the deputy political instructor of the company, actually directs the troops to carry out a "fake surrender" to the enemy. Here, the author seriously distorts the noble revolutionary qualities of our army and absurdly distorts Chairman Mao's great strategic and tactical thinking.
    Political work in the troops is portrayed as very weak. The political work that Xin Weiqun, who is praised by the author, does in the company is "telling jokes" and "telling stories." When the troops are tired from marching in the snow, he only repeats the empty phrase "we'll rest soon," without any propaganda or mobilization full of political content, so that "when this soldier is called up, that soldier lies down again." Is the political work of our troops like this? Is the discipline of the troops and the level of consciousness of the soldiers like this? The protagonists of the novel themselves are political workers, but readers cannot see them doing any political work. Moreover, their own political and ideological level is not high. The book rarely sees them having Party life, being led by the Party, or having serious criticism and self-criticism within the Party.
    Although the book also describes victorious battles, the author also exaggerates the situation of the troops encountering setbacks. When agencies that were not originally responsible for combat tasks encounter enemy attacks, they certainly cannot fight like combat troops. But the author focuses on describing these failures. As for those victorious battles, they are almost all led by those few intellectuals. Workers, peasants, and soldiers are instead written very badly. For example, this passage: "More than two hundred logistical personnel were so tired that they could not lift their legs. As soon as the machine gun fired, they all instinctively (it seems that at this time, the troops had no political ideology, only "instinct"—the author) perked up their spirits. Several people, not calmly, ran backwards, and many people followed suit involuntarily. The rear guard platoon lay down in place, and the platoon leader shouted hoarsely, but failed to stop the panicked crowd. It was the heavy machine gun fire from the front that brought the panicked crowd back... The sound of gunfire from all directions was deafening. The crowd, unable to go anywhere, immediately scrambled down in a mess, their bodies pressed tightly against the ground." Perhaps this is writing about "logistical personnel," but aren't they part of the Eighth Route Army, aren't they worker-peasant elements?
    The author's preference and support for the petty bourgeoisie, and his depreciation and distortion of worker-peasant elements can also be seen in the description of how a company coordinated with the main force of the battalion in combat. When the main force of the battalion was engaged in fierce combat with the enemy, the author wrote the instructor Sha Fei as being eager to coordinate, while the company commander of worker-peasant origin was written as being indifferent, watching and waiting.
    The relationship between the upper and lower levels of the Eighth Route Army in the book is almost the same as the relationship between the upper and lower levels in the old bureaucratic organs. Lower-level cadres quarrel and make noise, without political life. The author compares this to "when there is no cat in the house, the mice run amok," the so-called "cat" being the upper level in the Eighth Route Army, and the "mice" being the lower level. When the "cat" sees the "mice" running amok, it either "casually walks out," or the "mice" "slip out one by one." What a terrible slander!
    The relationship between the army and the people is also distorted. The author writes that our army is indifferent to the suffering of the people. When the countryside is destroyed and exploited by the Japanese invaders and traitors, and the lives of the peasants are extremely difficult, the troops still requisition military grain, only caring about their own eating, and not caring about the life or death of the people. The author vividly portrays the hunger of the troops. It seems that hunger has overwhelmed everything. Due to hunger, all work has stopped, and they are just waiting all day for "the bugle to blow for mealtime." Isn't this a serious slander of the troops? This shows no flesh-and-blood relationship between the revolutionary army and the people at all. This is not at all the same as the consistent style of the Eighth Route Army helping peasants solve the problem of famine and improving the lives of peasants. The Party's policy is seriously distorted here.
    In many places, the author shows a lack of love for the Party, the army, and the people, and a lack of hatred for the enemy.
    When mentioning the Southern Anhui Incident, the author actually uses the words "annihilated" so many of our troops in both the main text and the annotations of the novel. In the annotations, he even uses the phrase "annihilating 10,000 people in one fell swoop," which is indistinguishable from the enemy's tone. What an absurd mistake of losing one's position!
    When the author describes the various crimes of the Japanese invaders carrying out the cruel Three Alls Policy, he actually describes the enemy as having "conscience," being able to blame themselves, cherishing the lives of their troops, and recognizing their sins, and even expressing repentance!
    When the Japanese squadron leader Watanabe sees the villages in the mountains below being burned by him, the author describes Watanabe's mood like this:
    "'Fire! Sinful fire! Big fire, small fire, all caused by my own hands!' Watanabe thought regretfully... thinking that every time they attacked, his homeland would add a new batch of orphans and widows."
    When Watanabe rapes Chinese women, the author writes the victim as having no resistance at all, and does not write a word about her anger, but instead makes such a detailed portrayal of the Japanese invaders: he "can't help but doubt himself, why he does this kind of behavior, and why he does it so skillfully. He is a highly educated person, and his conscience is reproaching him."
    Isn't this defending the enemy? Isn't this abandoning even the national position? Does the author think that "highly educated people" will not commit shameless atrocities? The author here fully reveals his supra-class viewpoint, which is also a reactionary viewpoint of the bourgeoisie.
    The chapter in which the author describes Xin Weiqun's unyielding sacrifice in the enemy's prison also lacks ideological content. The author does not write about the revolutionary's deep hatred for the enemy, but instead focuses on writing about the enemy's bizarre and cruel behavior, including honey traps and feeding children to dogs. It only makes readers feel terror and suffocation, rather than being moved and inspired by the revolutionary's heroic behavior and noble qualities.
    The author shows an intolerable contempt for the strength of the enemy rear base area and the people. He also mocks the weapons of his own troops as much as possible, calling them "precious guns," "fire sticks," and "scrap iron." Is this the attitude of soldiers towards their weapons? The author also satirizes the countryside a lot, using a series of phrases such as "as if born in the Middle Ages," "remote and backward areas," and "primitive humans." Even the fire burned in the homes of the common people causes disgust among our cadres: "It's so annoying, it's suffocating," and this person happens to be the female protagonist praised by the author.
    The characteristic of the author's creative method is to use artificial, fictional, tortuous, and bizarre plots and vulgar and low-level tastes (even not lacking in pornography and obscene elements) to try to cater to the psychology of some backward readers.
    The author uses about twenty pages, using an objectivist attitude, to describe how the enemy's female spy takes off all her clothes to seduce our captured cadres. This plot is obviously fictional, fabricated by the author's subjective imagination. On the other hand, the author also fabricates that our women also use their beauty to bewitch the traitorous translator, in order to obtain intelligence. Both the enemy and us use honey traps!
    Low-taste jokes are on exhibition in this book. Many vulgar jokes (including Han Fuju's speech) and many limericks (including descriptions of farting) are piled up by the author in the book triumphantly. In his pen, cadres often joke around and make pointless pranks, even during night marches when the enemy situation is tense. From these places, it can also be seen that the author's thoughts and feelings are quite far from the war.
    In addition, there is the description of unideological love relationships that takes up a lengthy space.
    The protagonist Sha Fei, after being wounded in combat and being risked to be covered by the masses and hidden in a cave, actually feels "lonely in the long night," "no one to accompany him," "how unbearable the days will be"! He hopes to have someone to accompany him, "even the most annoying person." As a result, arranged by the author, in the "extreme boring loneliness" his beloved Lin Xia actually appears. Then the love story unfolds like this: the woman goes down the mountain and encounters rain, returns to the cave, the man asks her to take off her clothes, and the woman refuses. After being criticized for her feudalistic thinking, she takes them off after all. The author uses many sentences to describe this passage, which is similar to "erotic novels." The author makes even more effort to portray the psychological state of both men and women: how the woman is "shy like a young girl," "her cheeks flushed"; how the man imagines that this female soldier of the Eighth Route Army suddenly puts on "fashionable clothes"... "changes into a cheongsam"... "sweet little mouth, healthy body, must be more beautiful than any woman," and so on. When describing female comrades, the author often adopts similar stale phrases: "her eyes are like two pools of autumn water, with light waves blown by the breeze." The author either praises this female cadre as a female general in old novels, or compares her to urban bourgeois women, or else praises her as a "woman with women's characteristics," "good at needlework," and "good at housework." In these places, the author nakedly expresses his decadent bourgeois thoughts and feudal thoughts. Readers will never believe that this is writing about the guerrilla war behind enemy lines, or that this is writing about the revolutionary ranks. Readers will never believe that someone with such non-proletarian thoughts is actually the instructor, the communist, and the heroic figure praised by the author with more than 200,000 words of the Eighth Route Army.
    Perhaps, as a reader said earlier, the author wants to use these things to "drill into the depths of the petty-bourgeois soul" and attract readers? Therefore, he deviates from politics, abandons ideological content, and completely disregards the educational role of literary works for readers, violating Chairman Mao's direction of literature and art for workers, peasants, and soldiers! If it is said that the author's creative motive and attitude are impure, I think it is not inappropriate.
    Judging from the work, Comrade Bai Ren has some combat experience in the troops. Some relatively real life fragments also appear in some parts of the novel. These parts are still good, but they cannot offset the serious shortcomings and principled errors of the entire work. It should be said that the fundamental reason for these errors and shortcomings is that the author lacks the ideological feelings of the working class, but retains strong ideological feelings of the petty bourgeoisie. His erroneous standpoint makes it impossible or not completely possible for him to deeply understand and reflect reality, reflect workers, peasants, soldiers, and their struggles; it also makes it impossible for him to adopt a critical attitude to correctly reflect petty-bourgeois intellectuals; it also makes it impossible for him to distinguish well between the essential and non-essential things, advanced and backward things in real life; it also makes it impossible for him to have a clear understanding of what should be praised and what should be opposed. As a result, the historical picture of the battle in the enemy's rear cannot but be distorted and reversed.
    Comrade Bai Ren should deeply examine his own literary and artistic thoughts and once again seriously study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," especially the following passage, which is worth Comrade Bai Ren reading carefully and deeply reflecting on:
    "Many comrades pay more attention to studying intellectuals, analyzing their psychology, focusing on expressing them, excusing and defending their shortcomings... because they themselves are from petty-bourgeois origin, they themselves are intellectuals, so they only look for friends in the ranks of intellectuals, and focus their attention on studying and describing intellectuals. If this kind of research and description is based on the proletarian standpoint, it is appropriate. But they are not, or not completely. They are standing on the petty-bourgeois standpoint, they are creating their own works as self-expression of the petty bourgeoisie... giving full sympathy to intellectuals of petty-bourgeois origin, and even sympathizing with or even advocating the shortcomings of the petty bourgeoisie. For workers, peasants, and soldiers, they lack closeness, lack understanding... are not good at describing them... they also love workers, peasants, and soldiers in some aspects, and also love cadres of worker-peasant-soldier origin, but sometimes they do not love, in some places they do not love, do not love their feelings, do not love their posture... sometimes they openly despise them, and prefer intellectuals..."

    一本有严重错误和缺点的小说—“战斗到明天”
    袁水拍
    白刃作，中南军区政治部出版，一九五一年
    从“人民日报”许多读者来信中看到，读者们是同意“人民日报”简评对“战斗到明天”中的一章“血战天门顶”的批评的，他们并对这部长篇小说本身提出了不少正确的意见。从那些来信里，还看到一个值得注意的情况：部队里有小资产阶级思想残余的读者是很欢迎这部作品的。有这样一类反映：“看过之后，交口称赞，甚至有人看两三遍。”“捧读不舍，津津有味……钻进了小资产阶级的灵魂深处。”这种情况本身已经足够说明，对“战斗到明天”展开严肃的批评是必要的了。
    “战斗到明天”的错误和缺点是严重的，它歪曲了历史真实，歪曲了人民部队和党的领导，把小资产阶级代替了工人阶级的领导。作者在许多地方表现了离开工人阶级立场、人民立场、民族立场，而站到小资产阶级立场、资产阶级反动立场、敌人立场上去的严重错误。
    为什么某些小资产阶级知识分子欢迎这本书呢？因为：它的内容是迎合小资产阶级口味的；它顽强地表现和歌颂小资产阶级，宣传小资产阶级思想感情，原谅和欣赏他们的缺点；它大量地散布小资产阶级的庸俗低级甚至下流的趣味。因此，这本书，无论对于工农兵，还是对于小资产阶级知识分子来说，都缺乏教育意义，而且是有害的。
    小说写的是抗日战争时期，从一九四二年起，直到日本投降为止，八路军一一五师的一个支队，在鲁南敌后根据地所进行的反“扫荡”战争。书中主要人物是这支队的政治部宣传科的三五个人，他们的出身是小资产阶级知识分子，后来当了连的正、副指导员。从作者自己所宣布的本书的主题思想看来，他似乎要想创造几个和工农兵结合的知识分子典型；要想描写他们怎样经过战争的严重考验，改造了自己，成为革命队伍中的优秀干部；并且要想用这些典型人物的斗争经验来教育读者。这个目的有没有达到呢？没有。而且作者写这本小说的目的究竟是不是这样，也是很值得怀疑的。
    作者所写的鲁南敌后根据地一角，是缺乏典型意义的，它不足以代表山东当时的整个抗日根据地，不能使人对当时的历史环境得到一个正确的概念。作者强调了局部的阴暗面的刻划，并错误地把抗战初期的、一九四二年以前的游击队的一些缺点，搬到了一九四二年以后去，造成了历史阶段的混淆。作者所给人的根据地的印象是暗淡的，落后的，我们的部队是不够强大的，我们时常遭受敌人的袭击、进攻，时常转移、失败，而且失败得很狼狈。这些描写决不能反映出在一九四二年以后，已经大大发展了的整个山东解放区（包括渤海、滨海、胶东、鲁中、鲁西、鲁南等军区）的面貌，当然更不能使读者获得这样一个印象，即：在这时期内，中国共产党所领导的八路军、新四军正蓬勃成长，愈战愈强，在全国范围内开辟了十余个解放区，创造了无数光辉战绩，牵制着、抗击着日寇在中国的绝大部分侵略兵力，奠定了未来的胜利局面。读者不能够从这一个角落，看出全局的胜利形势，看出这里就是中国的最光明的地区之一，从这个以及其他相同的地区，孕育着一个新的中国。
    作者歪曲了敌后根据地，歪曲了历史真实。但它们实际上并不是作者所企图表现的，他所要表现的是三五个知识分子干部。他们才是作者注意力集中的所在，他们才是小说的主人公，也是历史的主人公。其他的人物，工农兵出身的军事干部反而成了配角。部队的战斗也变成了图画的背景。书中有好几章都只是在开头或结尾时简单地交代一下根据地当前的战争形势，然后以大部的篇幅着力描写这几个知识分子的活动和他们的思想感情的小天地。当然，这并不等于说，小资产阶级知识分子，在任何一个文艺作品中，都不能当作主角来描写，而是说要看作者以怎样的立场态度来描写，把他们放在什么地位？是写他们怎样从一个阶级转变为另一个阶级呢？还是写他们可以不转变而仍旧是值得肯定的人物？白刃同志虽则描写了这些知识分子怎样经历了不少锻炼而分化：有的堕落，有的前进；但那些前进的人究竟克服了哪些缺点，怎样克服的，却很少交代。他们为什么能够在敌人的监狱里宁死不屈，他们为什么能够在战场上英勇战斗，都没有正确的具有充分说服力的解释。甚至还作了错误的解释，仿佛他们的顽强坚决是由于他们的天性如此，或者个人好强，而不是由于党的教育培养和自己的政治觉悟的提高。非但他们的改造过程极不明显，而且他们究竟改造好了没有，也很成问题。他们的思想到最后并没有发生什么根本性质的改变，相反地，他们的小资产阶级劣根性，他们的优越感、个人英雄主义、自由主义，他们的小资产阶级的人生观，到最后也还是没有多少改变，而这些似乎并不会影响他们的战斗和进步。因此，与其说作者是真的想写小资产阶级的改造，不如说作者只是想表扬小资产阶级，替他们也是替作者自己的小资产阶级思想作放肆的宣传。
    让我们来看作者所歌颂的男主人公沙非。一开头作者就交代他有浓厚的个人英雄主义，可是到书的末尾，这个缺点并没有什么改变。沙非在最后几次接受作战任务时，还是表现了个人英雄主义。不是说他“想施展一下本事”，便是说他为了“在整个连的干部面前不愿意表示无能”，或者为了“怕别人说自己懦弱”，所以才接受任务。在描写作战紧张的时候，作者还是毫无批判地写沙非觉得“二排长不放自己在眼里”，因此“感到很大的侮辱，不禁暗暗地生气”。作者对这些错误思想或者不加批判，或者批判得十分无力。甚至有时候还采取了欣赏的态度，来歌颂他们的个人英雄主义：不是写他们怎样神奇地单身抓获特务，便是写他们怎样英勇地使用离奇的欺骗敌人的计策，冒险攻入敌人碉堡。
    在小说的终了，同样是那个应该说是已经改造了的男主人公沙非，竟为了负伤，脸上有了个疤而认为损害了容貌，十分懊恼，觉得这样就再也不能配得上和书中的女主人公林侠恋爱了。他的态度竟使林侠感到“好像可怕的魔爪，想把她的幸福夺去”。经过沙非的说明，林侠才放了心，而对沙非加以安慰，并且解释了“真正的美并不一定在外貌”，这样，我们的男主人公才被说服。这不是十足的小资产阶级的一幕无聊活剧吗？而作者居然把这件事加以歌颂。
    这样的小资产阶级知识分子完全不能成为好的典型，完全不能代表我们党内许多优秀的知识分子，他们虽则是非无产阶级出身，但受到了党的教育，经过了无数锻炼，已经和工农兵密切结合，改造了思想，成为工人阶级知识分子了。作者把沙非等人当作正面人物，当作典型，来加以歌颂，无疑是对中国的优秀的革命知识分子的歪曲。
    作者的非无产阶级立场观点，同样也造成了他在描写工农兵和工农兵出身的军事干部方面的失败。
    工农兵和工农兵出身的干部，在本书中仅占次要的或极不重要的地位。和知识分子相比，他们的面貌思想的描绘都是简陋的，不鲜明的。更由于作者对小资产阶级的偏爱和对工农兵的不熟悉、冷淡、旁观和轻视，他们的形象是被大大地歪曲了，丑化了。作者完全不能够感受和写出他们的高贵品质和崇高的思想感情，他一味寻找他们的缺点和落后的一面，毫无顾忌地加以夸大和嘲弄。
    例如书中的宣传科科长王川，就是作者笔下的一个牺牲品。作者一面介绍他是贫农出身，长征老干部，“在党的教育下进步快”。可是具体的形象却是“演起剧来，台词咬不清，唱起歌来，常常变调；个子太高，两条仙鹤腿，又不适宜跳舞，只好拉拉幕布，扛扛搭台子的木棒，做一些打杂工作。即使出场，也不过是跑跑龙套”。王川当了宣传科长以后，被科里的一批知识分子看不起，作者通过他们的嘴，对他加以种种讽刺和奚落：“文化水平低”，“不大懂文艺”，“十足的土包子”。作者甚至使王川自己也觉得相形见拙，自惭形秽起来，“深深感到，自己对许多新事物的不懂。如果不急起直追，一定会落后”。所谓“急起直追”，是追谁呢？自然是作者认为比工农兵分子优越得多的王川下面的那些小资产阶级劣根性没有清除的知识分子了。在面貌外形上，作者也把他写得很丑，几次三番提到他的腿长，称之为“仙鹤腿”、“螳螂步”。与此相反的是作者笔下的知识分子：男的是“五官端正”的“美男子”、“古代骑士”，女的是“海燕”、“圣洁的女神”。
    作者不止一次提到工农出身的领导干部的方言的可笑：“一口江西话”，“满口湖南腔”，“很难懂”。写到知识分子时，则非但没有这些形容词，反而要表扬他们如何受过高等教育，如何“一口北京话”说得“清亮”好听等等。
    军事领导干部既是这样，一般的战士自然被写得更是不堪，洋相百出了。作者所写的伤员，就是一些没有政治觉悟、开口就骂粗话的人。他费了很多篇幅来写两个伤员犯纪律偷吃杏子，最后如何被知识分子破案的故事，这段描写，在这本书里，可以说是达到了歪曲工农兵形象、歪曲八路军后方医院的顶点。那个后方医院，竟被作者写得黑漆一团，领导干部被写成是一个军阀主义者，外号竟是“阎王爷”！缺乏民主，毫无工作能力。伤员们大讲怪话，把医院所属的八路军的上级机关也描写成有严重脱离群众和有官僚主义缺点的机关，“光看工作报告”，“不肯下来看看”，“在上头蹲着多舒服”。在这样一个医院里，作者离奇地捏造了偷采杏子的一个瞎眼伤员背了一个无脚伤员偷采杏子的案件。他们犯了纪律竟长久不觉悟，另一个战士被怀疑之后，竟至自杀。最后还是依靠知识分子沙非去解决问题，也依靠他才帮助了医院支部把医院整顿好，而整顿的方法是建立一个以沙非为领导的独立在党的组织以外的所谓“进步会”的组织。这是多么严重的对党的领导的漠视！为了要表扬主人公知识分子干部沙非，并渲染他和另一知识分子林侠的恋爱，不惜把八路军的后方医院的机构百般糟塌，恣意诬蔑；为了衬托知识分子的优越能干，不惜把八路军的英勇的负伤的战士，写得愚蠢粗鲁和毫无纪律。
    作者也歪曲了我们的军队和军队的领导。
    我们的军队是有高度政治觉悟、严格的纪律、坚强的战斗力、正确的战略战术、良好的政治工作的部队，他们和群众的关系是十分密切的。尤其重要的是：他们是党所领导的部队。
    作者很少写到部队的党的领导，很少提到高级指挥。只有一次，在一件琐事的叙述中忽然附带提到了一一五师师政治委员罗荣桓同志的名字。但提起他，并不是为了涉及重要的政治性的事件，却仅仅是“罗荣桓坐在游戏场上”“剃光头”，来号召大家剃光头。作者一并提到的是朱德总司令，也还是关于“剃光头”的“号召”。全书写高级领导的，仅有这一句“剃光头”的话。这件事的叙述和敌后反“扫荡”战争中的部队的高级领导、党的领导所起的作用是完全不相称的。
    作者所表现的我军的作战，仿佛经常不是按作战的原则来进行的，胜利并不是正确地运用战略战术来获得的，而是采取一些少数人冒险的办法来获得的。书中不止一次出现了一些为作者所歌颂的离奇惊险的战斗。这一次是“用软的办法打”，那一次又是“强攻困难”，还是用了“旁的办法”。这种写法发展到顶点，便是天门顶的战斗。连队的副指导员辛为群竟指挥部队向敌人实行“假投降”。作者在这里严重地歪曲了我军的高贵的革命品质，荒谬地歪曲了毛主席的伟大的战略战术思想。
    部队中的政治工作被描写得非常薄弱。作者所歌颂的辛为群在连队里所作政治工作是“说笑话”“讲故事”。队伍在风雪中行军疲劳的时候，他只是重复“快休息了”这句空话，没有任何充满政治内容的宣传鼓动，以致“喊起了这个战士，那个战士又躺下”。难道我们部队的政治工作是这样的吗？部队的纪律、战士的觉悟程度是这样的吗？小说的主人公们本身都是政治工作人员，但读者却看不到他们做什么政治工作。而且他们本身的政治思想水平，就是不高的，书中很少看到他们有党的生活，受到党的领导，有党内的严肃的批评和自我批评。
    书中虽然也描写了胜利的战斗，但部队遭遇挫败的情形也被作者夸大地描写着。原来并不负有战斗任务的机关，当遭遇敌人袭击时，当然不能像战斗队伍那样作战。但作者却拿这些失败来着重地加以描写。至于那些胜利的战斗，则差不多都是那几个知识分子领导的。工农兵反而被写得很糟糕。例如这样一段：“二百多个勤杂人员，个个累得抬不起腿。机关枪一响，都本能地（似乎这时候，部队没有了政治思想，只剩下“本能”——笔者）振起精神。有几个不沉着向后跑，好多人不自主地跟着跑。后卫排在原地卧倒，排长嘶声叫喊，没有阻止慌乱的人群。倒是在前方一阵急雨般的重机枪，将慌乱的人群打回来……四面八方的枪炮声响成一片。四面走不通的人群，登时乱七八糟地爬下，身体紧贴着地面。”也许这是写的“勤杂人员”吧，但他们不是八路军的一部分，不是工农分子吗？
    在描写一个连队怎样策应营主力作战的问题上，也看得出作者对小资产阶级的偏爱和捧场，以及对工农分子的贬抑和歪曲。当营主力和敌人展开激烈战斗时，作者把指导员沙非写成是急于要去策应的，而把工农出身的连长写成是漫不关心，旁观等待的。
    书中八路军的上下级关系和旧官僚机关中的上下级关系是差不多的。下级干部乱吵乱闹，没有政治生活，作者比之为“家中没有猫，老鼠瞎胡闹”，所谓“猫”就是八路军中的上级，“老鼠”就是下级。“猫”看见“老鼠”胡闹时，不是自己“搭讪着走出去”，就是“老鼠”们“一个个溜出去”。这是多么恶劣的污蔑！
    军民关系也是歪曲的，作者把我军写成对人民的痛苦是漠不关心的。在农村遭到日寇和汉奸的破坏，榨取，农民生活极端困难的时候，部队还是征军粮，只顾自己吃，不顾人民死活。作者淋漓尽致地刻划部队的挨饿情形。好像饥饿已经压倒了一切。由于饥饿，一切工作都停止了进行，成天只等
    “吹开饭哨子”。这不是对部队的严重污蔑吗？这里丝毫没有表现出革命军队和人民的血肉关系。这和八路军帮助农民解决灾荒问题，改善农民生活的一贯的作风，是丝毫也没有相同之处的。党的政策在这里被严重地歪曲了。
    在许多地方表现了作者缺乏对党、对军队、对人民的热爱，缺乏对敌人的仇恨。
    在提到皖南事变的时候，作者竟在小说的正文和注解中都用了“歼灭”我军多少人的字样。在注解中更用了“一举而歼灭一万人”的与敌人口吻毫无区别的用语，这是多么荒谬的丧失立场的错误！
    作者在描写日寇进行残酷的三光政策的种种罪行时，竟把敌人描写得很有“良心”，会自己责备自己，爱惜自己部队的生命，并且认识到自己的罪恶，还表示了忏悔！
    当日寇中队长渡边看见山下农村被他纵火焚烧时，作者这样描写渡边的心情：
    “‘火！罪恶的火！大火，小火，都是我亲手造成的！’渡边懊悔地想了一下……想到每次讨伐，故国要添一批新的孤儿寡妇。”
    渡边强奸中国妇女时，作者把被侮辱者写得毫无反抗，一句也没有写到她的愤怒，而对日寇反而做了这样的细致的刻划：他“不觉怀疑自己，为什么干这种行为，竟干得这样熟练，他是受过高等教育的人，良心在责备他”。
    这不是在替敌人辩护吗？这不是连民族立场也抛开了吗？作者难道认为“受过高等教育的人”，就不会做出无耻暴行来吗？作者在这里充分流露了他的超阶级的观点，也是资产阶级的反动观点。
    作者描写辛为群在敌人监狱里不屈就义的一章，也是缺乏思想性的。作者没有写出革命者对敌人的深刻仇恨，反而集中地写了敌人的离奇残忍的行为，包括美人计和把小孩喂狗等等。使读者只是感到恐怖，窒息，而不是被革命者的英勇行为和崇高品质所感动和鼓舞。
    作者对敌后根据地和人民的力量，表现了不能容忍的轻蔑。他对自己部队的武器也尽情加以嘲笑，称之为“宝贝枪”、“烧火棍”、“废铁”，这难道是战士对自己武器的态度吗？作者对农村也加以许多讽刺，用了“仿佛生在中世纪”、“穷乡僻壤”、“原始人类”等等一连串的字句。老百姓家里烧火，也引起了我们干部的反感：“真讨厌，熏死人”，而这人正好是作者所歌颂的女主人公。
    作者的创作方法的特点，是运用人为的虚构的曲折离奇的情节和庸俗低级的趣味（甚至并不缺少色情和下流的成分）来企图迎合一部分落后读者的心理。
    作者用二十来页的篇幅，用客观主义的态度来描写敌人的女特务怎样脱光了衣服来引诱我们的被捕的干部，这种情节显然是虚构的，凭作者主观想像来捏造的。而另一方面，作者也捏造了我们的妇女也同样用美色去迷惑汉奸翻译官，取得情报。敌我双方都用美人计！
    低级趣味的笑料在这本书里开着展览会，许多庸俗的笑话（包括韩复渠演讲）、许多打油诗（包括描写放屁的），被作者得意洋洋地堆砌在篇幅里。在他的笔下，干部经常开玩笑，闹无聊的恶作剧，即使在敌情紧张的夜间行军的时候也是如此。从这些地方也可以看出作者的思想感情和战争的距离是相当远的。
    此外就是占去冗长的篇幅的无思想的恋爱关系的描写。
    主人公沙非在作战受伤，被群众冒死掩护，藏在山洞里后，竟觉得“长夜寂寞”，“没人做伴”，“日子将多么难堪”！他希望有人做伴，“那怕是最讨厌的人”。结果，经过作者的安排，“在极端无聊的寂寞里”居然出现了他所爱慕的林侠。接着就展开了这样的恋爱故事：女的下山遇雨，回到洞里，男的要她脱衣服，女的不肯。在被批评了思想封建之后，毕竟脱去了。作者用许多字句描写这一段和“香艳小说”差不多的情节。作者更竭力刻划男女双方的心理状态：女的如何“少女似的羞怯”，“两腮起了红晕”；男的如何设想这个八路军女战士忽然穿上了“时髦的服装”……“换上了旗袍”……“甜甜的小嘴，健康的身材，一定比任何女人美丽”等等。作者在描写女同志时，经常采用类似这样的陈腐字句：“双眼像两潭秋水，被微风吹起轻波”。作者要不是赞美这女干部像旧小说中的女将，便是把她来媲美于城市中的资产阶级女性，再不然就歌颂她是一个“有着女人特点的女人”，“会做针线”，“会管家务”。在这些地方，作者露骨地表现了他的腐朽的资产阶级思想和封建主义思想。读者决不相信这里是在写敌后游击战争，是在写革命的队伍。读者决不相信具有这种非无产阶级思想的，竟是八路军的指导员、共产党员，是被作者用二十多万字来歌颂的英雄人物。
    也许正如前面一位读者所说的，作者是想用这些东西来“钻进小资产阶级的灵魂深处”，来吸引读者吧？因此就脱离政治、抛弃了思想内容，完全不顾文艺作品对读者的教育作用，违反了毛主席的工农兵文艺方向！如果说作者的创作动机和态度是不纯正的，我想也不是不恰当的。
    从作品来看，白刃同志是有一些部队战斗经验的。在小说的某些部分也出现了一些比较真实的生活片断，这些部分还是好的，但它们并不能抵销整个作品的严重缺点和原则性的错误。应该说，造成这些错误和缺点的根本原因是作者缺乏工人阶级的思想感情，而是保留着浓厚的小资产阶级思想感情。他的错误的立场观点使他不可能或不完全可能深入和理解现实，反映现实，反映工农兵和他们的斗争；也使他不能采取批判的态度来正确反映小资产阶级知识分子；也使他不能对现实生活中的本质和非本质的东西，先进和落后的东西，很好地加以区别；也使他不能对于应该歌颂什么和反对什么，有清楚的认识。其结果不能不使一幅敌后根据地的战斗的历史图画，弄得歪曲和颠倒了。
    白刃同志应该深刻检查自己的文艺思想，并再一次地认真学习毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”，特别是下面这一段话，是值得白刃同志认真细读，拿来深深反省的：
    “有许多同志比较地注重研究知识分子，分析他们的心理，着重地去表现他们，原谅并辩护他们的缺点……因为他们自己是从小资产阶级出身，自己是知识分子，于是就只在知识分子的队伍中找朋友，把自己的注意力放在研究与描写知识分子上面。这种研究与描写如果是站在无产阶级立场上的，那是应该的。但他们并不是，或者不完全是。他们是站在小资产阶级立场，他们是把自己的作品当作小资产阶级的自我表现来创作的……对于小资产阶级出身的知识分子寄与满腔的同情，连小资产阶级的缺点也加以同情甚至鼓吹。对于工农兵，则缺乏接近，缺乏了解……不善于描写他们。……他们在某些方面也爱工农兵，也爱工农兵出身的干部，但有些时候不爱，有些地方不爱，不爱他们的感情，不爱他们的姿态……有时就公开地鄙弃它们，而偏爱知识分子……”
