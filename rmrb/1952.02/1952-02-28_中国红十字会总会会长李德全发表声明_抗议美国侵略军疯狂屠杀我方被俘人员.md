    Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Issues Statement
    Protesting the American Aggressor Troops' Frenzied Massacre of Our Captured Personnel
    [Reported by this newspaper] Li Dequan, President of the Chinese Red Cross Society, issued a statement protesting the American aggressor troops' frenzied massacre of our captured personnel on Geoje Island. The statement said: Following the towering crime of large-scale bacteriological warfare on the Korean front and in the rear, the American aggressor troops immediately launched a bloody massacre of our captured personnel on Geoje Island. This inhuman and cruel persecution and collective slaughter of our unarmed and abused prisoners of war is further proof that the U.S. military, in its desperate struggle, dares to challenge the dignity of human civilization, humanity, and justice, and is willing to be the enemy of all mankind.
    It is known to all that treating and protecting prisoners of war who have lost their ability to fight is a basic requirement of international law during wartime, especially as clearly stipulated in the 1929 and 1949 Geneva Conventions on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, which the U.S. government signed. The conventions stipulate that prisoners of war should be treated humanely in all circumstances, and should not be subjected to abuse or insult to their dignity, let alone be held as hostages or executed. Once hostilities have ceased, they should be released unconditionally and repatriated.
    However, the American aggressor troops' mistreatment and killing of prisoners of war is far more vicious and cruel than that of the German fascists and Japanese imperialists in World War II. In the prisoner-of-war camps set up by the U.S. military on Geoje Island and in Suwon and other places, they used gasoline to burn bodies, electric light to blind eyes, poisonous mosquitoes to bite teeth, fire brands and water steaming, and other cruel tortures to kill captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. They were even more sinister and terrifying than the Buchenwald and Auschwitz death factories of the Hitler gang, making people's hair stand on end and their eyes split with rage. As early as March of last year, the U.S. military dispatched an infantry landing craft under the pretext of epidemic prevention, loaded with bacteria, to Wonsan Port, Korea, using captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers as experimental subjects for bacteriological weapons. The Society filed a complaint with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the League of Red Cross Societies, demanding sanctions; and at the Executive Committee of the League of Red Cross Societies held in Geneva in May last year, we proposed a motion to expose the atrocities of the U.S. military and called on the 68 Red Cross member states and the people of the world to rise up together and fight to stop such bestial crimes. At the Executive Committee of the League of Red Cross Societies held in Geneva in December last year, the delegation of the Chinese Red Cross Society once again lodged the most severe condemnation against the American aggressors, and called on more than 100 million Red Cross workers around the world to take practical and effective actions to impose strong sanctions.
    Today, the American aggressors are brazenly carrying out cruel bacteriological warfare and creating bloody massacres of prisoners of war, wantonly tearing up international law, undermining humanitarian conventions, and attacking the humanitarian justice and security of all mankind. We, the Red Cross Society, standing on humanitarian grounds, cannot tolerate such heinous crimes. The Society once again issues an urgent call, suggesting that the people of the world and the Red Cross Societies of all countries, holding high the banner of humanitarianism,
    act together, take effective measures immediately, and impose the most severe sanctions on the U.S. military's frenzied atrocities.

### 中国红十字会总会会长李德全发表声明  抗议美国侵略军疯狂屠杀我方被俘人员

    抗议美国侵略军疯狂屠杀我方被俘人员
    【本报讯】中国红十字会总会会长李德全发表声明，抗议美国侵略军在巨济岛疯狂屠杀我方被俘人员。声明说：美国侵略军紧接着在朝鲜前线和后方进行了大规模细菌战争的滔天罪行之后，立即又在巨济岛上发动了疯狂屠杀我方被俘人员的血腥惨案。这种惨绝人寰、灭绝人性的残酷迫害、集体屠杀我手无寸铁、受尽凌虐的被俘人员的卑劣的暴行，正是美军在疯狂挣扎中胆敢向人类文明的尊严、人道与正义挑衅、不惜与全人类为敌的又一明证。
    举世皆知，优待并保护失去战斗力的俘虏，是战时国际公法的基本要求，尤其是美国政府参加签字的一九二九年和一九四九年日内瓦战时俘虏待遇公约所明确规定的。公约规定：俘虏在任何情况下都应受到人道的待遇，不得虐待其本身，侮辱其人格，更不得拘留人质，执行死刑，在敌对行动一经停止后应一律无条件释放并遣送回国。
    但是美国侵略军虐待和残杀俘虏，却远较第二次世界大战中的德国法西斯和日本帝国主义者更为毒辣，更为残酷。美军在巨济岛和水原等地所设的俘虏营中，用汽油烧身，电光射眼，毒蚊咬齿，火烙水蒸等等酷刑来残杀朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员，比希特勒匪帮的布痕瓦尔德和奥斯威辛杀人厂，尤为阴森恐怖，令人发指眦裂。早在去年三月，美军就曾派遣一艘以防疫为名的步兵登陆艇，满载细菌，开到了朝鲜元山港，把中国人民志愿军被俘人员当作细菌武器的试验品。本会曾向红十字国际委员会和红十字会协会提出控诉，要求予以制裁；并在去年五月日内瓦举行的红十字会协会执行委员会上，提出议案，揭露美军暴行，号召六十八个红十字会员国和全世界人民，一致奋起，为制止此种野兽罪行而奋斗。在去年十二月日内瓦举行的红十字会协会执行委员会上，中国红十字会代表团再次向美国侵略者提出了最严厉的谴责，并号召全世界一亿以上的红十字工作者，采取实际而有效的行动，予以强有力的制裁。
    今天美国侵略者竟悍然施行残酷的细菌战争与制造屠杀战俘的血腥惨案，肆无忌惮地撕毁国际公法，破坏人道公约，向全人类的人道正义与安全进攻。我们站在人道主义立场上的红十字会，绝不能容忍这种滔天罪行。本会再度发出紧急号召，建议全世界人民和各国红十字会，高举人道主义的旗帜，
    一致行动起来，立即采取有效措施，对美军疯狂暴行予以最严厉的制裁。
