Guiyang City Arrests Master Thief Lai Yongchu
Lai Exploited the Chaos During Guiyang's Liberation to Steal National Property and Refused to Confess

    On February 6th, the Guiyang Municipal People's Government arrested the master thief and big profiteer Lai Yongchu and sealed all of Lai's property. Lai was formerly the General Manager of the puppet Guizhou Provincial Bank. Before and in the early days of Guiyang's liberation, Lai used his puppet position to steal more than 460,000 silver dollars of national assets, burn account books, and bribe cadres in an attempt to cover up his crimes. Lai still refused to confess during this anti-corruption, anti-theft campaign.

    Before and in the early days of Guiyang's liberation, Lai Yongchu had systematically and deliberately stolen a large amount of national property. According to preliminary investigations, from mid-September 1949 to November 15th, when Guiyang was liberated, Lai Yongchu used his solely owned Yixingchang Silver Shop, Hengxing Winery, and Yongxing Salt Shop, and borrowed from Lishengzhuang, Taixinghao, Xinghuahang, Dachang Agricultural Products Shop, Tongtaifeng, Yuanshengzhuang, Detaifuhao, Qiangxing Company, Baohefenghao, Renshifuhao, Zhenchang Trading Company, Fufenghang, and other names to borrow 185,200 silver dollars from the puppet Guizhou Provincial Bank. Except for a portion returned to the puppet Guizhou Provincial Bank a few days before Guiyang's liberation, 138,200 silver dollars were still owed after liberation. This large sum should have been fully converted into RMB at the silver dollar rate and returned to the state, but Lai Yongchu took advantage of the chaos and used a treacherous means, instructing Luo Deming, the deputy chief of the business section of the puppet Guizhou Provincial Bank (retained to work in the savings section of the Guizhou branch of the People's Bank), to withdraw all loan contracts, changing the borrowed silver dollars into "silver dollar notes." After we took over the work, Lai submitted false contracts for handover. By February 1950, Lai Yongchu gradually repaid the above loans at a ratio of one silver dollar to forty silver dollar notes. With this alone, Lai Yongchu directly stole 130,850 silver dollars of national property. At the same time, Lai Yongchu borrowed 56,400 silver dollars from the puppet Guizhou Provincial Bank under the names of Yaxingzhuang, Yumin, Rongxiang Industrial Company, Taixinghang, etc., and repaid them in the same way, stealing 53,860 silver dollars of national property.

    On November 10th, 1949, five days before the liberation of Guiyang, Lai Yongchu "borrowed" 200,000 silver dollars, equivalent to 2,000 taels of gold, from the puppet Central Bank and pocketed it.

    The day after Guiyang's liberation, Lai Yongchu colluded with Chen Peiyuan, the chief of the cashier section and the issuing section of the puppet Guizhou Provincial Bank, and instructed puppet employees Li Yongming and Zhu Yongkai to directly steal and exchange 12,000 silver dollars from the state treasury with 12,000 puppet "silver dollar notes." Before liberation, Lai also misappropriated more than 70,000 silver dollars of inventory reserve. The day before Guiyang's liberation, Lai dumped a large amount of salt and a portion of gold, exchanging them for silver dollar notes, intending to make up for the national inventory he had stolen after liberation.

    According to the above preliminary statistics, Lai has stolen 466,710 silver dollars from the state, causing extremely serious losses to national property.

    After liberation, the People's Government repeatedly ordered the masses and former military and government personnel to hand over hidden state assets. However, Lai Yongchu, a major criminal who systematically and deliberately stole state property, has consistently refused to mend his ways. In the early days of the People's Government takeover, Lai felt that relying solely on the set of false accounts created by him in collusion with Jiang Jue Zhang, the accounting director of the puppet Guizhou Provincial Bank, would not be able to cover up his thieving acts. Therefore, he colluded with You Zhisheng, the manager of the business department of the puppet Guizhou Provincial Bank, to burn all the three-part receipts in the bank's inventory, attempting to destroy evidence and disrupt the takeover work of the People's Government. In March 1950, the Creditors' and Debtors' Clearing Committee of the People's Government was preparing to question Lai about the handover of the puppet Guizhou Provincial Bank. This news was learned in advance by Dong Chengdian (working in the Guizhou Provincial Finance and Economics Commission), who secretly informed Lai. Lai then convened a meeting of relevant accomplices to discuss "countermeasures" to evade criminal responsibility. He threatened those present, saying, "Everyone has a responsibility," and enticed them by saying, "As long as we get through this, everyone will benefit." At the same time, Lai Yongchu extensively bribed and bought off a group of retained personnel. In early 1950, when the Creditors' and Debtors' Clearing Committee cleared the puppet Guizhou Provincial Bank, Luo Deming, Wang Yuheng, Chen Minghe, Chen Peiyuan, Li Zhenwei, and others, who had "contributed" to Lai by altering contracts, each received 4 million yuan in bribes. Luo Deming, because he was retained, had previously leaked the state's then-determined exchange rate between silver dollars and silver dollar notes to Lai Yongchu, and therefore received an additional 5 million yuan in bribes. To further win over his accomplices, Lai Yongchu bribed Luo Deming, Chen Peiyuan, Chen Minghe, Li Zhenwei, Zou Zubin, and others with a gold bar (weighing more than ten taels), instructing them to divide it equally among themselves.

    Lai Yongchu is not only a major criminal who stole from the state treasury but also a profiteer who speculated and sought exorbitant profits. In addition to frequently engaging in drug trafficking before liberation, Lai Yongchu, in January 1950, ordered Luo Wenbin, the person in charge of his Kunming branch, to buy 2,000 taels of opium, transport it through Guiyang, and sell it in Changsha. In March of the same year, Luo Wenbin again trafficked more than 2,000 taels of opium and soda ash from Kunming and sold them in Guiyang.

                                                                                                                                                                      (Yefeng)

    贵阳市逮捕大盗窃犯赖永初
    赖犯在贵阳解放时混水摸鱼，窃取国家财产拒不坦白
    贵阳市人民政府二月六日逮捕了大盗窃犯、大奸商赖永初，并查封了赖犯所有的财产。赖犯原为伪贵州省银行总经理，在贵阳解放前夕和解放初期，利用伪职，窃取国家银元四十六万多枚，并焚毁账册，贿买干部，妄图掩盖罪行。赖犯在这次反贪污、反盗窃运动中仍然拒不坦白。
    贵阳解放前夕和解放初期，赖犯永初曾有计划、有步骤地盗窃了大量的国家财产。据初步了解，从
    一九四九年九月中旬到十一月十五日贵阳解放时止，赖犯永初即用他独资经营的怡兴昌银号、恒兴酒厂、永兴盐号，并先后借利盛庄、泰兴号、兴华行、大昌农产行、同泰丰、源生庄、德泰孚号、强兴公司、宝和丰号、仁实孚号、震昌贸易行、福丰行等名义，向伪贵州省银行贷款十八万五千二百元（银元）。除贵阳解放前几天归还伪贵州省银行一部外，解放后，尚欠银元十三万八千二百元。这笔巨款，本应全部以银元折合人民币归还国家，但赖犯永初却乘火打劫，用偷天换日的卑鄙手段，主使伪贵州省银行业务课副课长罗得铭（留用在人民银行贵州分行业务科储蓄股工作），抽回全部贷款契约，把所借银元改为“银元券”。我接管工作开始后，赖犯便以假契约办理移交。到一九五零年二月，赖犯才把以上贷款按银元与银元券一比四十的比价折合人民币陆续还清。仅这一笔，赖犯永初就直接盗窃国家财产银元十三万零八百五十元。同时，赖犯又曾用亚兴庄、裕民字号、荣祥实业公司、泰兴行等名目，向伪贵州省银行借得银元五万六千四百元，用同样办法归还，从中盗窃了国家财产银元五万三千八百六十元。
    一九四九年十一月十日，也就是贵阳解放的前五天，赖犯永初向伪中央银行“借”得银元二十万元，折合黄金二千两，吞入私囊。
    在贵阳解放后的第二天，赖犯永初又和伪贵州省银行出纳课长兼发行课长陈培源勾结，叫伪职员李永明、朱永恺拿伪“银元券”一万二千元直接盗换国库银元一万二千元。解放前夕，赖犯又曾挪用库存准备金银元七万多元。在贵阳解放前一天，赖犯曾抛出大批盐巴和一部黄金，换取银元券，蓄意在解放后弥补他盗窃的国家库存。
    仅据以上初步材料统计，赖犯已盗窃国家银元四十六万六千七百一十元，使国家财产遭受到极其严重的损失。
    解放后，人民政府曾三令五申，号召群众和旧军政人员缴出隐匿的国家资财。但是，赖永初这个有计划、有步骤地盗窃国家财产的大罪犯，始终不愿改过。人民政府接管初期，赖犯觉得仅靠他勾结伪贵州省银行会计主任蒋珏璋所制造出来的那一套假账，是无法掩盖他的强盗行径的。于是，他又勾结伪贵州省银行业务部经理游芝升，把该行库存三联单全部焚毁，企图消灭罪证，并破坏人民政府的接管工作。一九五零年三月，人民政府债权债务清理委员会曾就关于伪贵州省银行接交事宜，准备向赖犯提出质问。这项消息事先被留用人员董承典（在贵州省财政经济委员会工作）知道了，偷告赖犯。赖犯便召集有关帮凶，开会商议逃避罪责的“对策”。他威胁到会人员，说“大家都有责任”，并利诱说：“只要把这件事情应付过去，大家都有好处。”同时，赖犯永初对一批被留用下来的人员大肆贿赂收买。一九五零年初，债权债务清理委员会清理伪贵州省银行时，伪银行职员罗得铭、王玉衡、陈明和、陈培源、李镇伟等因替赖犯改换契约“有功”，每人得贿赃款四百万元。其中罗得铭因被留用，事先把国家当时决定的银元和银元券还款的比价，泄露给赖犯永初，故又多得贿款五百万元。为进一步拉拢帮凶，赖犯又贿赂罗得铭、陈培源、陈明和、李镇伟、邹祖彬等黄金一条（重十多两），叫他们五人均分。
    赖犯永初不仅是盗窃国库的巨犯，同时也是投机取巧、牟取暴利的奸商。赖犯除在解放前经常干着贩运毒品的勾当外，解放后，一九五零年一月，又令他的昆明庄的负责人罗文彬，买两千两鸦片，经贵阳转运长沙出售。同年三月，罗文彬又从昆明贩运鸦片及曹达二千多两，在贵阳销出。
