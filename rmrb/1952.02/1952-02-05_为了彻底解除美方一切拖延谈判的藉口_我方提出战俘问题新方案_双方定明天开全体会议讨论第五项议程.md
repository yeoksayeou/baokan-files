Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 3rd - Since the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations began meeting on December 11th of last year, it has held 52 meetings to date. Our side proposed the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war held by both sides after the armistice at the first meeting, and then proposed reasonable principles and suggestions for resolving all items on the fourth agenda at the second meeting. The other side, from the very beginning, violated the agenda, refused to discuss our fair and reasonable principles and suggestions, and demanded the resolution of its so-called preconditions, using prisoner of war materials as an excuse to entangle and delay. In order to remove its excuse, we submitted complete materials of all prisoners of war held by our side to the other side on December 18th of last year. However, the other side delayed until January 28th, that is, 41 days after our side submitted the materials, before submitting the basic materials that should have been submitted, and even then they were still incomplete. After the excuse of the materials was removed by our side, in order to reject our reasonable proposal of December 12th of last year, the other side put forward a completely absurd counter-proposal, openly advocating the so-called "voluntary repatriation" which actually attempts to detain prisoners of war and deprive them of their basic rights, and the so-called "one-for-one exchange," which actually attempts to conduct barbaric human trafficking, and later called it "equal number exchange." They also confused the issue of prisoners of war with the issue of displaced civilians, insisting on using civilians to top up the number of prisoners of war, using prisoners of war as hostages, and advocating unilateral so-called "oaths." Although due to our thorough refutation, the other side had to revise this absurd proposal once and "expand" it once, it was still the same wine in a new bottle, and its content and essence were not improved at all. Due to the other side's insistence on these unreasonable demands, the meeting was delayed for 54 days, and even a principled agreement on the fourth agenda item has not yet been reached. The responsibility lies entirely with the other side. In order to satisfy the desire for peace of the people of the world and to remove all excuses for the other side's delay, our side once again made efforts and proposed a new plan today (attached below). Our representative solemnly stated that our plan is based on unshakable correct principles, absorbs all reasonable factors that can be absorbed from the other side's plan, and completely removes the so-called excuse of not increasing military strength, which is the root of all the other side's claims. Our representative requested the other side to seriously study and accept it as a principled agreement on the fourth agenda item so as to quickly enter into detailed discussions.
    At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, both sides reviewed for the third time all the clauses in the draft armistice agreement related to the second and third agenda items. The main points of disagreement between the two sides are the issue of military personnel rotation and the issue of rear ports. Our side insists that the number of rotating military personnel entering Korea from outside Korea during the armistice period should not exceed 25,000 per month, and that all rotating personnel entering Korea during the armistice period must be inspected by the neutral nations supervisory commission inspection team at specific rear ports to ensure that neither side increases military personnel reinforcements from outside Korea during the armistice period. Our side suggested that Sinuiju, Hamhung, and Chongjin on our side and Busan, Incheon, and Suwon under the control of the other side be designated as specific ports. However, the other side insisted on a rotation limit of 75,000 per month and insisted that both sides designate twelve specific ports each. Our staff pointed out that after the cessation of hostilities, the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of weapons and ammunition should be greatly reduced. The rotation limit of 25,000 per month and the suggestion of three specific ports on each side proposed by our side are fully capable of meeting the needs of both sides.
    On January 31st, the chief representative of the other side suggested that while discussing the third and fourth agenda items, the fifth agenda item should be started. On February 3rd, our chief representative, General Nam Il, agreed to the other side's suggestion and specifically suggested that a plenary meeting of the representatives of both sides be convened to first determine the principled agreement on the fifth agenda item, and then be handed over to the staff meeting designated by both sides to formulate detailed rules, and submit them to the conference for approval. The plenary meeting is held at different times from the fourth agenda item subcommittee and the third agenda item staff meeting, so that the discussion of the third and fourth agenda items is not affected, in order to accelerate the progress of the armistice negotiations.
    Our Proposal on the Fourth Agenda Item
    (1) Both sides agree that after the signing and entry into force of the military armistice agreement, all prisoners of war held by each side will be immediately released and repatriated.
    (2) Both sides agree to guarantee that all their captured personnel should resume peaceful life after being repatriated and no longer participate in war actions.
    (3) Both sides agree to give priority to the repatriation of seriously wounded and sick prisoners of war. When both sides repatriate such prisoners of war, they should, to the extent possible, repatriate captured medical personnel with them to take care of them.
    (4) Both sides agree that within a period of two months after the signing and entry into force of the military armistice agreement, all prisoners of war held by both sides, other than those given priority for repatriation under Article 3, shall be repatriated in batches.
    (5) Both sides agree to use Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone as the location for the transfer of prisoners of war by both sides.
    (6) Both sides agree that after the signing and entry into force of the military armistice agreement, each side shall immediately send three colonels to form a Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee, under the supervision of the Military Armistice Commission, responsible for specifically planning and supervising the implementation of all provisions related to prisoner of war repatriation in this military armistice agreement by both sides. If the committee cannot reach an agreement on any matter concerning its relevant tasks, it shall immediately submit it to the Military Armistice Commission for decision. The address of the Prisoner of War Repatriation Committee shall be located near the headquarters of the Military Armistice Commission.
    (7) Both sides agree that after the signing and entry into force of the military armistice agreement, they shall immediately invite representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and representatives of the Red Cross Societies of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People’s Republic of China to form a joint visiting group to conduct on-site visits to the prisoner of war camps of both sides and to assist in the repatriation work at the prisoner of war transfer locations of both sides.
    (8) Both sides agree that to the extent possible, and no later than ten days after the signing and entry into force of this military armistice agreement, they shall submit to the other side the names, nationalities, ranks and other relevant materials of all prisoners of war who died while in captivity.
    (9) Both sides agree that after the signing and entry into force of the military armistice agreement, they shall assist civilians displaced by the war to return to their homes and resume peaceful life.
    (A) The United Nations Command shall permit and assist civilians who originally resided north of the existing military demarcation line but who were displaced south of the existing military demarcation line before the signing and entry into force of the military armistice agreement to return to their homes. The Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army shall permit and assist civilians who originally resided south of the existing military demarcation line but who were displaced north of the existing military demarcation line before the signing and entry into force of the military armistice agreement to return to their homes.
    (B) The supreme commanders of both sides are responsible for widely publicizing the contents of the above agreement in the areas under their control and instructing their relevant civil affairs agencies to provide necessary guidance and assistance to all the above-mentioned civilians who are willing to return to their homes.
    (C) Both sides shall immediately send two colonels each to form a Committee to Assist Displaced Civilians in Returning Home after the signing and entry into force of the military armistice agreement, under the supervision of the Military Armistice Commission, responsible for handling matters related to assisting the above-mentioned returning civilians through the demilitarized zone and other related matters. If the committee cannot reach an agreement on any matter concerning its relevant tasks, it shall immediately submit it to the Military Armistice Commission for decision. The address of the Committee to Assist Displaced Civilians in Returning Home shall be located near the headquarters of the Military Armistice Commission.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 4th - At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on February 4th, both sides reviewed for the fourth time all the clauses in the draft armistice agreement related to the second and third agenda items. The differences between the two sides on the issue of rotation and the issue of rear ports have not yet been resolved due to the other side's continued insistence on large and unnecessary rotation figures and the number of rear ports.
    The liaison officers of both sides have agreed to hold a plenary meeting of the delegations of both sides at 10:00 am on February 6th to discuss the fifth agenda item "Recommendations to the relevant national governments of both sides."
    At the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item, our representative further explained our proposal of February 3rd, reiterated that our basic position of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war after the armistice cannot be changed, and firmly opposed the other side's unreasonable claim of so-called "voluntary repatriation."

    为了彻底解除美方一切拖延谈判的藉口  
    我方提出战俘问题新方案  
    双方定明天开全体会议讨论第五项议程
    【新华社开城三日电】朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程的小组委员会自去年十二月十一日开始开会以来，到今天已经开了五十二次会。我方在第一次会上就提出了停战后释放并遣返双方所收容的全体战俘的原则，在第二次会上更接着提出了合理解决第四项议程的一切原则建议。对方则一开始就违反议程，拒绝讨论我们的公平合理的原则建议，而要求解决其所谓先决条件，并以战俘材料为藉口，进行纠缠和拖延。我们为解除其藉口，在去年十二月十八日以我方所收容的全体战俘的完整材料提交对方，对方却拖延到一月二十八日，即我方提交材料后四十一天，才将应交的基本材料交来，并且仍然是不完全的。在材料的藉口被我方解除后，为了拒绝我方去年十二月十二日的合理方案，对方就提出一个完全荒谬的对案，公然主张实际上企图扣留战俘并剥夺战俘基本权利的所谓“自愿遣返”，主张实际上企图进行野蛮的人口买卖的所谓“一对一交换”，后来又称之为“同等数目交换”。他们又把战俘问题与流离失所平民问题混为一谈，坚持要以平民顶战俘，以战俘作人质，并主张片面的所谓“宣誓”。虽然由于我方的彻底驳斥，对方不得不对这个荒谬的提案改头换面作了一次“修改”和一次“扩充”，但仍然是换汤不换药，其内容和本质毫无改进。由于对方坚持这些无理要求，以致会议拖延了五十四天的时间，对第四项议程连原则的协议尚未达成，其责任完全在于对方。为了满足全世界人民渴望和平的愿望，为了解除对方一切拖延的藉口，我方再次努力在今天提出了一个新方案（附后）。我方代表郑重提出我方这一方案，是根据不可动摇的正确原则，吸收了对方方案中的所有能够加以吸收的合理因素，并彻底解除作为对方一切主张之根源的所谓不得增加军事力量的藉口的方案。我方代表要求对方郑重地研究并接受它作为第四项议程的原则协议，以便迅速进入细节讨论。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，双方第三次检阅了停战协定草案中有关第二项与第三项议程的全部条款。双方分歧之点主要在于军事人员轮换问题和后方口岸问题。我方主张停战期间自朝鲜境外进入的轮换军事人员每月不得超过二万五千人，所有在停战期间进入朝鲜的轮换人员，必须在特定后方口岸经由中立国监察委员会的视察小组进行视察，以保证双方在停战期间，不自朝鲜境外进入增援的军事人员。我方建议以我方新义州、咸兴、清津与对方控制下的釜山、仁川与水原为特定口岸。但对方主张以每月七万五千人为轮换的限额，并主张双方各指定十二个特定口岸。我方参谋人员指出敌对行为中止以后，军事人员的轮换和武器弹药的替换，都应该有大量的削减，我方所提出的每月二万五千人的轮换限额和双方各三个特定口岸的建议是完全可以满足双方的需要的。
    一月三十一日对方首席代表建议在讨论第三、第四两项议程的同时，开始讨论第五项议程。二月三日我方首席代表南日将军同意对方的建议，并具体建议召开双方代表全体会议，首先确定第五项议程的原则协议，然后交由双方指定的参谋会议拟定细则，提交大会批准。全体会议与第四项议程小组会和第三项议程参谋会议在时间上错开举行，使三、四两项议程的讨论不受影响，以加速停战谈判的进展。
    我方关于第四项议程的提案
    （一）双方同意在军事停战协定签字并生效后，立即释放并遣返各自所收容的全部战争俘虏。
    （二）双方同意保证其全部被俘人员，在被遣返后应恢复和平生活，不再参加战争行动。
    （三）双方同意优先遣返重伤重病战俘。双方在遣返此类战俘时，应在可能范围内同时遣返被俘的医务人员与之随行，以便照顾。
    （四）双方同意应在军事停战协定签字并生效后的两个月的期间内，分批遣返双方所收容的除第三条优先遣返者以外的一切战俘。
    （五）双方同意以非军事区内的板门店为双方交接战俘的地点。
    （六）双方同意在军事停战协定签字并生效后，即各派校级军官三人成立战俘遣返委员会，在军事停战委员会的督导之下，负责具体计划并监督双方实施本军事停战协议中有关战俘遣返的一切规定。该委员会如对其有关任务的任何事项不能达成协议，应即提交军事停战委员会决定之。战俘遣返委员会的会址设在军事停战委员会总部所在地附近。
    （七）双方同意在军事停战协定签字并生效后，立即分别邀请红十字国际委员会代表及朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国红十字会代表，组成联合访问团，到双方战俘营进行就地访问，并在双方交接战俘地点，协助遣俘工作。
    （八）双方同意在可能范围内，应尽速并至迟在本军事停战协定签字并生效后的十天以内，将所有在被俘期间死亡的战俘姓名、国籍、级别及其他有关材料提交对方。
    （九）双方同意在军事停战协定签字并生效后，应协助因战争而流离失所的平民返回家乡，恢复和平生活。
    （甲）联合国军应准许并协助原住于现有军事分界线以北而在军事停战协定签字并生效前、流落于现有军事分界线以南的平民返回其家乡。朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军应准许并协助原住于现有军事分界线以南而在军事停战协定签字并生效前、流落于现有军事分界线以北的平民返回其家乡。
    （乙）双方最高司令官负责将上述协议之内容，在其所控制的地区内广为发布，并责成其有关民政机关，对所有上述愿意返乡的平民予以必要的指导与协助。
    （丙）双方在军事停战协定签字并生效后，即各派校级军官二人，成立协助失所平民返乡委员会，在军事停战委员会的督导之下，负责办理协助上述返乡平民通过非军事地区及其他有关事宜。该委员会如对其有关任务的任何事项不能达成协议时，应即提交军事停战委员会决定之。协助失所平民返乡委员会的会址设在军事停战委员会总部所在地附近。
    【新华社开城四日电】二月四日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，双方第四次检阅了停战协议草案中有关第二项议程与第三项议程的全部条款。双方在轮换问题与后方口岸问题上的分歧，由于对方继续主张庞大而不必要的轮换数字和后方口岸的数目，仍然未获解决。
    双方联络官已商定于二月六日上午十时举行双方代表团全体会议，讨论第五项议程“向双方有关各国政府建议事项”。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方代表就我方二月三日的提案，进一步作了解释，重申我方主张在停战后释放并遣返全部战俘的基本立场不能改变，坚决反对对方的所谓“自愿遣返”的不合理的主张。
