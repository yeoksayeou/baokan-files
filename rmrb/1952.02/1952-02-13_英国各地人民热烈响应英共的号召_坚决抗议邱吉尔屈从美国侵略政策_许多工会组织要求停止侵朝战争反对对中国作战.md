Xinhua News Agency, London, 12th -- News: Since British Prime Minister Churchill delivered a servile speech in the United States Congress on January 17, supporting the American aggressive policy in the Far East, the protest movement of the British people against Churchill's speech has become a massive wave of anger in the past month. Their unanimous slogan is "Resolutely Do Not Fight China!"

Starting the day after Churchill delivered his speech, the British Communist Party repeatedly called on the British people to oppose Churchill's subservience to the American aggression policy. On January 25, Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the British Communist Party, exposed the dangers contained in Churchill's speech to the people of the whole country. He pointed out: "Now is the most urgent time for the British people to make their voices heard." He called on the British people to "let Churchill and the Americans know: 'The British working people are firmly opposed to prolonging the Far East War'," "Let the demand of 'No Interference in China' resound throughout Britain." At the beginning of this month, the Political Committee of the British Communist Party issued another statement, calling on the British people to step up their struggle. The Political Committee of the British Communist Party pointed out: All Labour Party members, workers, Communist Party members, trade union members, and members of the cooperative movement should unite and force the Labour Party members in Parliament to oppose the policies of the Conservative government. The statement concluded: British workers should launch struggles inside and outside Parliament, and never allow war against China, and strive for the withdrawal of British troops from Korea, Malaya, and Egypt, and strive for the conclusion of a five-power peace pact.

Under the call of the British Communist Party, people from all over Britain have been continuously sending letters and telegrams, holding meetings, passing resolutions and petitions, and sending delegations to visit members of parliament and the government, demanding guarantees of a peaceful policy in the Far East. Workers in Campbell and Isherwoods in Boutle County held a conference on January 29 and unanimously passed a resolution protesting Churchill's speech. The London Shop Employees Union submitted a resolution passed by the union to Churchill, saying: "We demand an immediate armistice agreement in Korea and the quick withdrawal of all British troops." The London Veterans for Peace Movement Association held an emergency meeting and decided to send a delegation to the Prime Minister's residence to express opposition to the threat of war. The Sheffield Trade Union Labor Committee, representing 40,000 workers, passed a resolution stating that if Churchill supports the United States in preparing to expand its aggression, all members will carry out a vigorous resistance. At a meeting convened by the Trafford branch of the British Peace Committee, 500 people unanimously demanded that the British government adopt a peaceful policy. The Walton Electrical Workers Union branch in Liverpool demanded that the British government strive for an immediate cessation of the Korean War. In Lanarkshire, Scotland, workers from factories and mines and local veterans sent many delegations to visit Labour Party members in various districts and submit petitions, demanding that they guarantee to force the government not to fight against China and to conclude a five-power peace pact; these delegations also demanded that the Korean issue be included on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council. The district committees of the National Union of Agricultural Workers in Dorset and Milton Mowbray also passed resolutions opposing the extension of the Far East War.

The "Britain-China Friendship Association" played a huge role in the protest movement against Churchill's speech. On February 1, the association held an emergency meeting on "No War with China" at Holborn Hall in London. Labour MP Silverman said at the meeting: "Britain must declare that we are unwilling to participate in any new Far East war aimed at restoring the oppression of the Chinese people by feudal landlords and usurers." Lieutenant Colonel Collins, who served as a senior British official at MacArthur Headquarters in Tokyo, said: Being friendly with China means understanding the problems of the Chinese people and trading with them, and our country desperately needs this trade. Now, the association has decided to hold a "Peace with China" conference at the Beaver Hall in London on February 23 (originally scheduled for the 9th, postponed due to circumstances). According to an announcement by the association on the 8th, the conference has received widespread support from various trade unions and cooperative organizations in the United Kingdom, and the association has also received many written opinions protesting the British government's support for American policy.

    英国各地人民热烈响应英共的号召
    坚决抗议邱吉尔屈从美国侵略政策
    许多工会组织要求停止侵朝战争反对对中国作战
    【新华社十二日讯】伦敦消息：自从英国首相邱吉尔一月十七日在美国国会奴颜婢膝地发表了支持美国对远东侵略政策的演说以后，近一个月来，英国人民反对邱吉尔演说的抗议运动已经蔚为声势浩大的怒潮。他们一致的口号是“坚决不与中国作战！”
    从邱吉尔发表其演说的第二天开始，英国共产党就一再号召英国人民反对邱吉尔屈从美国侵略政策的行为。一月二十五日，英共总书记波立特向全国人民揭露邱吉尔演说所包含的危险性。他指出：“现在是英国人民应该发出他们的呼声的最紧急的时候了。”他号召英国人民应该“让邱吉尔和美国人知道：“英国劳动人民是坚决反对延长远东战争的”，“让‘不许干涉中国’的要求响遍全英国”。本月初，英国共产党政治委员会又发表声明，号召英国人民加紧斗争。英国共产党政治委员会指出：一切工党党员工人、共产党党员、工会会员和合作社运动的成员，应该团结起来，迫使议会中的工党议员反对保守党政府的政策。声明最后说：英国工人应该在议会内外展开斗争，决不容许对中国作战，并争取英国军队撤出朝鲜、马来亚和埃及，争取缔结五大国和平公约。
    在英国共产党的号召下，英国各地人民连日不断地发出函电，举行集会，通过决议和请愿书，派遣代表团访问议员和政府，要求保证在远东实行和平政策。包特尔县的坎拜尔和伊舍伍兹两地的工人群众在一月二十九日举行大会，一致通过决议，抗议邱吉尔的演说。伦敦店员工会向邱吉尔提出该会通过的决议说：“我们要求立即在朝鲜签订停战协定，并赶快撤退一切英国军队。”伦敦退伍军人保卫和平运动协会曾召开紧急会议，决定推派代表团赴首相官邸，表示反对战争威胁。代表四万工人的设菲尔德工会劳工委员会通过决议说：如果邱吉尔支持美国准备扩大侵略的行动，全体会员将进行有力的反抗。在得拉福德英国和平委员会分会所召开的会议上，五百名到会的群众一致要求英国政府采取和平政策。利物浦的沃尔顿电气工会分会要求英国政府力求即时停止朝鲜战争。在苏格兰的拉纳克郡，各工厂、矿山的工人和当地的退伍军人派遣了许多代表团访问各区的工党议员并递交请愿书，要求他们保证迫使政府不得对中国作战，并缔结五大国和平公约；这些代表团还要求把朝鲜问题列入联合国安全理事会的议程。多塞特郡和密尔顿·莫勃莱郡的全国农业工人联合会的区委员会也分别通过决议，反对延长远东战争。
    在反对邱吉尔演说的抗议运动中起着巨大作用的，是“英中友好协会”。二月一日，该会在伦敦荷尔本大厦举行了“不与中国作战”的紧急会议。工党议员锡尔佛曼在会上说：“英国必须声明，我们不愿参加任何旨在恢复封建地主和高利贷者对中国人民的压迫的新的远东战争。”曾任东京麦克阿瑟总部英国方面高级官员的考林斯中校说：和中国友好意味着了解中国人民的问题并且与他们进行贸易，我们的国家非常需要这种贸易。现在，该会又已决定二月二十三日（原定九日举行，因故延期）在伦敦碧佛厅举行“对中国和平”大会。据该会八日宣布，这次大会已受到英国各工会和合作社组织的广泛拥护，该会同时还接到了许多抗议英国政府支持美国政策的意见书。
