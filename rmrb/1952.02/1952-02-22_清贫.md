Editor's Note: This article was written in prison by Comrade Fang Zhimin, a martyr of the Chinese Communist Party, after he was captured by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army in 1935. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary comrade can see from this that the great revolutionary martyr, Comrade Fang Zhimin, although holding extremely heavy responsibilities (at the time, he was the commander-in-chief of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's vanguard force for the Northern Expedition against Japan, overseeing two army corps), led a very simple and plain personal life. He used the "money raised for the revolution" "bit by bit for the revolutionary cause," asking nothing for himself personally. Today, in the struggle against corruption and waste, every comrade should learn and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Comrade Fang Zhimin, actively struggle to eliminate the shameful phenomena of corruption and waste in the revolutionary ranks, and rapidly advance the cause of building a new China, completing the glorious cause left to us by the martyrs.

I have been engaged in revolutionary struggle for more than ten years. In this long-term struggle, I have always lived a simple life and have never been extravagant. The funds I have handled have totaled several million yuan, but the money raised for the revolution has been used bit by bit for the revolutionary cause. In the eyes of the great men of the Kuomintang, this seems like a miracle or an exaggeration, but self-restraint, integrity, and selflessness are virtues possessed by every Communist Party member. So, if anyone asks me if I have any savings, I can tell you an interesting story.

On the very day I was captured—a most unfortunate day—two Kuomintang soldiers found me in the woods and, guessing who I was, eagerly hoped to find a thousand or eight hundred silver dollars on me, or some gold bracelets or gold rings, and make an unexpected fortune. Who knew that from my upper body to my lower body, from my collar to the bottom of my socks, they found nothing but a watch and a fountain pen, not even a copper coin. They became enraged and suspected that I had hidden the money somewhere and was unwilling to take it out. One of them, holding a wooden-handled grenade in his left hand, pulled out the fuse in the grenade with his right hand, took a step back with his feet apart, made a throwing gesture, and stared at me with fierce eyes, threateningly shouting: "Quickly take out the money, or I'll blow you to death with a bomb!"

"Humph! Don't make such an ugly face! I really don't have a single copper coin. You're wrong if you want to make a fortune from me," I said with a faint smile.

"Who are you trying to fool! Someone in your position as a high-ranking official wouldn't have any money!" The soldier with the grenade firmly disbelieved.

"There's no way you wouldn't have any money; it must be hidden somewhere. I'm experienced; you can't fool me."

Another soldier, while saying this, bent his back and carefully pinched my clothes and crotch a second time, always hoping for a new discovery.

"You have to believe what I say; don't bother searching! I'm not like you Kuomintang officials, who all have money. I really don't have a single copper coin today. Our revolution isn't for getting rich!" I explained to them again.

When they were sure that they could not find anything on me, they stopped searching. They also searched around the place where I was hiding, looking down attentively, but found nothing. How disappointed they were! The soldier who wanted to throw the grenade also put the pulled fuse back into the wooden handle of the grenade and turned to snatch my watch and pen. Later, they agreed that the money from selling the watch and pen would be split equally, and that was that. They looked at me up and down several times with suspicious and astonished eyes and then ordered in unison: "Let's go!"

Is it necessary to ask if I have any property at home? Please wait a moment, let me think. Ah, I remember, there is some, but not much. The few sets of old sweat shirts and pants I wore last summer, and the few pairs of socks with sewn soles, have been given to my wife to keep in a deep mountain valley—for fear that they would be snatched away by the Kuomintang army during an attack, and to prepare for wearing them again this summer. Those are my only possessions. But wouldn't my mentioning those few "heirlooms" make those wealthy people feel cold for three days?!

Poverty, a clean and simple life, is precisely where we revolutionaries can overcome many difficulties!

May 26, 1935 (Written in prison).

    清贫
    方志敏烈士遗作
    编者按：本文是中国共产党烈士方志敏同志一九三五年被蒋介石匪军俘掳以后在狱中写的。每个共产党员和革命同志都可以从这里看到，伟大的革命烈士方志敏同志虽然担任着极繁重的工作（当时为中国工农红军北上抗日先遣队总司令，督率着两个军团），进行了长期的严重战斗，但他个人的生活却是十分简单朴素的。他把“为革命而筹集的金钱”，“一点一滴地用之于革命事业”，个人则一无所求。今天我们在反对贪污、浪费的斗争中，每个同志都应该学习和发扬方志敏同志这种革命精神，为肃清革命阵营中可耻的贪污浪费现象而积极斗争，使新中国的建设事业迅速前进，完成烈士们遗留给我们的光荣事业。
    我从事革命斗争，已经十余年了。在这长期的奋斗中，我一向是过着朴素的生活，从没有奢侈过。经手的款项总在数百万元；但为革命而筹集的金钱，是一点一滴地用之于革命事业。这在国民党的伟人们看来，颇似奇迹，或认为夸张；而矜持不苟，舍己为公，却是每个共产党员具备的美德。所以，如果有人问我身边有没有一些积蓄，那我可以告诉你一桩趣事。
    就在我被俘的那一天——一个最不幸的日子，有两个国民党军的兵士，在树林中发现了我，而且猜到我是什么人的时候，他们满肚热望在我身上搜出一千或八百大洋，或者搜出一些金镯、金戒指一类的东西，发个意外之财。那知道从我上身摸到下身，从袄领捏到袜底，除了一只时表和一枝自来水笔之外，一个铜板都没有搜出。他们于是激怒起来了，猜疑我是把钱藏在那里，不肯拿出来。他们之中有一个，左手拿着一个木柄榴弹，右手拉出榴弹中的引线，双脚拉开一步，作出要抛掷的姿势，用凶恶的眼光钉住我，威吓地吼道：“赶快将钱拿出来，不然就是一炸弹，把你炸死去！”
    “哼！你不要作出那难看的样子来吧！我确实一个铜板都没有。想从我这里发洋财，是想错了。”我微笑着淡淡地说。
    “你骗谁！像你当大官的人会没有钱！”拿手榴弹的兵士坚不相信。
    “决不会没有钱的，一定是藏在那里，我是老出门的，骗不得我。”
    另一个兵士一面说，一面弓着背第二次将我的衣角裤裆过细的捏，总希望有新的发现。
    “你们要相信我的话，不要瞎忙吧！我不比你们国民党当官的，个个都有钱。我今天确实是一个铜板也没有。我们革命不是为着发财啦！”我再向他们解释。
    等他们确知在我身上搜不出什么的时候，也就停手不搜了。又在我藏躲地方的周围，低头注目搜寻了一番，也毫无所得，他们是多么地失望呵！那个持弹欲放的兵士，也将拉着的引线仍旧塞进榴弹的木柄里，转过来抢夺我的表和水笔。后彼此说定表和笔卖出钱来平分，才算无话。他们用怀疑而又惊异的目光，对我自上而下地望了几遍，就同声命令地说：“走吧！”
    是不是还要问问我家里有没有一些财产？请等一下，让我想一想。啊，记起来了，有的有的，但不算多。去年暑天我穿的几套旧的汗褂裤，与几双缝上底的线袜，已交给我的妻放在深山坞里保藏着——怕国民党军进攻时，被人抢了去，准备今年暑天拿出来再穿。那些就算是我唯一的财产了。但我说出那几件“传世宝”来，岂不要叫那些富翁们齿冷三天！？
    清贫，洁白朴素的生活，正是我们革命者能够战胜许多困难的地方！
    一九三五年五月二十六日（写于囚室）。
