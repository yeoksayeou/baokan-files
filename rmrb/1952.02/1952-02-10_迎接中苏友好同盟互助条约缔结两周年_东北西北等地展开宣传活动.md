    To welcome the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance
    Northeast, Northwest, and other regions launch propaganda activities
    [Our Newspaper] To mark February 14th, the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, local Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations are preparing to hold celebrations around this great festival. Combining this with the current movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, increase production and practice economy, and oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, they are preparing to carry out large-scale propaganda activities.
    The Northeast General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and various people's organizations in the Northeast have instructed their subordinate organizations at all levels to hold large-scale mass activities during "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" (February) to educate the broad masses of people with the spirit of internationalism and patriotism, and to enhance the people's understanding of the Soviet Union and Sino-Soviet friendship. The Northeast General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also held a forum for responsible cadres of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in the Northeast provinces and cities on January 17th and 18th to review the preparations for "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month" and discuss the work plan for 1952. At the meeting, cadres of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations from various places reported on the preparations for the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month": The Sino-Soviet Friendship Associations in Shenyang, Lüda, Benxi, Anshan, Fushun, Harbin and other places will carry out propaganda through methods such as posters, slides, movies, ball games, skating competitions and exhibitions.
    In addition to deciding to hold celebrations for people from all walks of life in the Northwest provinces and cities on February 14th, the Northwest General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association also requested that Sino-Soviet friendship propaganda be carried out around February 14th. The Xi'an Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has formulated a propaganda plan, which emphasizes that the content of the propaganda must be closely integrated with the current movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and introduce more of the Soviet people's experience in increasing production and practicing economy.
    Mines, farms, streets, and villages in Hebei Province will focus on celebrating the second anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between China and the Soviet Union, strengthening resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, increasing production and practicing economy, and opposing corruption and waste. In addition to holding a mass meeting on February 14th, it was also decided to conduct in-depth propaganda after the meeting through various meetings, such as membership meetings, group meetings, and chats, to strive for every person in every place in the province to receive education on Sino-Soviet friendship, resistance to U.S. aggression and aid to Korea, increased production and practicing economy, and the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.
