    The first "Resist America, Aid Korea" documentary has been screened in forty-four cities across the country, as well as in some industrial, mining, rural areas, and military units, and has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses. According to preliminary statistics, more than ten million viewers across the country have now seen this film. The audience has shown a high degree of political enthusiasm for the screening of this film. Before the film was screened in Wuhan, the number of viewers who booked tickets at eleven cinemas reached 512,000, accounting for more than 50% of the city's population. In Hangzhou, the audience reached 210,000 in nine days, accounting for 40% of the city's population. In Guangzhou, the audience was approximately 840,000 in eight days, accounting for 52% of the city's population. In Shanghai, the audience had reached 2.06 million by January 27th. Because the audience was extremely crowded, many cinemas in various places screened the film continuously eight to ten times a day. In Shenyang, the film began screening before dawn, and many industrial workers and rickshaw pullers braved the cold wind to watch the first chartered screenings in groups. In Wuhan, suburban farmers, vegetable vendors, manure carriers, nuns, monks, etc., all watched the film in an organized manner. Many people who had never watched a movie before entered the cinema for the first time. Some workers and citizens watched the film with their whole families and engaged in heated discussions. The high degree of patriotism and internationalism of the Chinese People's Volunteers has become an important force inspiring them to progress, produce, and enthusiastically donate.
    The reason why this film has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses is partly due to the general improvement of the political awareness level of the masses, who have shown infinite love for films that record the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, with the Chinese People's Volunteers as the main force. On the other hand, the correct organization of the screening of this film and the vigorous leadership of the propaganda for this film by local Party committees and cultural and educational propaganda departments are also important factors for the good screening effect of this film. This is an experience worth paying attention to. Under the guidance of the propaganda departments of local Party committees, many cities have organized screening committees. Many newspapers have promptly published review articles in prominent positions. Responsible comrades from local propaganda departments and people from all walks of life have successively delivered speeches or published articles in their localities, publicizing the political significance of the film's release, which has played a significant role in mobilizing local performances. Wuhan's "'Resist America, Aid Korea' Film and Photo Mobile Exhibition" was exhibited on the main streets of Hankou and Wuchang for ten days. The film propaganda street screening team continuously screened trailers for five nights, which powerfully called on and mobilized the audience. In the propaganda and organization work, many employees of film management companies and their offices in various places also played their due active role. Eighteen first-run cinema employees in Shanghai organized themselves to go deep into the masses to organize audiences. In addition to inviting representatives of the cinema's basic audience in batches to hold座谈会 (zhoutanhui - symposiums) continuously before the film screenings to discuss how to mobilize the audience, Beijing cinema employees also requested representatives to mobilize the audience through the second people's representative conference of all circles currently being held in the district. Employees of the Da Guangming Cinema organized fifteen propaganda groups to go to factories to carry out propaganda, which was warmly welcomed by the workers of various factories. Cinema employees in Wuhan organized mobile ticket sales teams to deliver tickets to farmers and women in the near suburbs who rarely go out. Through such extensive mobilization and organization, this film with significant political significance has achieved the screening effect it deserves.
    However, it must be pointed out that the attitude taken by some newspapers towards the screening of this film is incorrect. Some of them mistakenly believe that "all documentaries are not very good." Some newspapers did not have any publicity articles during the screening period, and did not publish a single film review. They did not regard the propaganda for this film as a political task. Film is a very powerful tool for the Party to educate the masses, and it is wrong to neglect or not fully do a good job in the propaganda work for good films.

    应重视电影的宣传工作
    “抗美援朝”文献纪录片第一部，在全国四十四个城市及若干工矿、农村、部队里放映以来，获得了广大群众的热烈欢迎。据初步统计，现在全国各地已有一千万以上的观众看了这部片子。观众对这部影片的放映，表现了高度的政治热情。这部片子在武汉市上映前夕，十一家影院订票的观众即达五十一万二千多人，占全市人口百分之五十以上；在杭州，九天内，观众即达二十一万人，占全市人口百分之四十；在广州，八天内，观众约为八十四万人，占全市人口百分之五十二；在上海，自放映到元月二十七日止，观众已达二百零六万人。因为观众异常拥挤，各地有许多影院都在一天内连续放映八场到十场。在沈阳，天亮之前影片就开始放映，许多产业工人和三轮工人冒着寒风，成群结队地去看第一次包场。在武汉，郊区农民、菜贩、送粪工人、尼姑、和尚等，都有组织地看了这部片子。过去有许多从不看电影的人，也第一次走进了电影院。有的工人、市民，全家都看了这部片子，并展开了热烈讨论。中国人民志愿军高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，成为鼓舞他们进步、生产、热烈捐献的重要力量。
    这部影片所以获得了广大群众的热烈欢迎，一方面是由于群众的政治觉悟水平的普遍提高，对于以中国人民志愿军为主的，记录抗美援朝运动为内容的影片表现了无限热爱；一方面各地党委和文教宣传部门正确地组织了这部片子的放映和大力领导了对于这部片子的宣传，也是这部片子放映效果良好的重要因素。这是一个值得重视的经验。在各地党委宣传部门指导下，许多城市都组织了放映委员会。许多报纸都及时地以显著地位登载了评介文字。各地宣传部门的负责同志及各界社会人士都纷纷在当地发表演说或发表文章，宣传此片上映的政治意义，对当地的演出起了重大的动员作用。武汉市的“‘抗美援朝’电影图片流动展览”，在汉口和武昌各大街展览了十天；影片宣传街头放映队，连续五夜放映预告片，都有力地号召和动员了观众。在宣传组织工作中，各地影片经理公司及其办事处的很多职工，也发挥了应有的积极性。上海有十八家首轮影院职工，曾组织起来深入群众，组织观众。北京电影院职工除分批邀集该院基本观众代表，在影片放映前连续举行座谈，商讨如何动员观众外，并通过该区正在举行的第二次各界人民代表会议请代表们动员观众。大光明影院职工组织了十五个宣传小组先后到工厂宣传，受到各厂工人热烈欢迎。武汉市的影院职工组织了流动售票组，把票送到近郊轻易不出门的农民、妇女手里去。经过这样广泛动员组织，使这一具有重大政治意义的影片，获得了应有的映出效果。
    但必须指出：有些报纸对这一影片的映出所采取的态度是不对的。他们当中有人错误地认为“凡是纪录片都不太好”。有的报纸在放映期间，则一点宣传文字也没有，没有发表过一篇影评。他们没有把对这部影片的宣传，当作是一件政治任务。电影是党教育群众的极有力的工具，忽视或不充分作好对好电影的宣传工作是错误的。
