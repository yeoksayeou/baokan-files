    Xi'an City Holds Mobilization Meeting for Confession and Accusation
    The Xi'an City Thrift and Inspection Committee held a 200,000-person mobilization meeting on the 5th, vigorously launching a struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence. Each district in the city simultaneously organized citizens to listen to the live broadcast of the meeting.
    Confessions and accusations were made at the meeting. Pang Zhengyi and Li Peiwen, cadres of the Xi'an Municipal People's Government Taxation Bureau, accused unscrupulous merchants who had induced them to commit crimes. Some illegal merchants also confessed at the meeting to their crimes of bribery and theft of state property. Unscrupulous merchants whose confessions were not thorough were questioned and accused by the masses present. The accusation station set up at the meeting received more than 4,200 letters from the masses accusing unscrupulous merchants.
    Zhao Boping, director of the Municipal Thrift and Inspection Committee, gave a summary at the end of the meeting. He said that unscrupulous merchants who were named at the meeting and failed to confess within the deadline would be punished by law. He called on the people of the city to make persistent efforts and not to stop until the bourgeoisie's rampant attack was defeated.
    The entire Northwest Sub-Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and the Northwest Sub-Delegation of the Korean People's Delegation to China were invited to participate in the meeting. The heads of the two sub-delegations, Qu Jingji and Cai Hengmo, respectively reported on the arduous fighting of the Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army, which aroused warm applause and cheers from the audience.
    Shanghai Railway Administration Encirclement and Suppression of Major Corrupt Officials
    The Shanghai Railway Administration has now entered the stage of encircling and suppressing major corrupt officials.
    The Shanghai Railway Administration has adopted a variety of methods, such as inspection, accusation, and internal and external integration, to promote thorough confessions by corrupt elements. In addition to various mobilization reports, the bureau also organized confession demonstrations by corrupt elements and convened symposiums for corrupt elements who had confessed and those who had not. At the same time, it combined confession with accusation and inspection to subdue certain corrupt elements who were unwilling to confess honestly. These have played a significant role in the struggle against corrupt elements.
    Currently, the bureau is further searching for "tigers" in the departments that use the most money, have the most contact with merchants, and have the most waste. They will not give up until all the tigers are eliminated.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    西安市举行坦白检举动员大会
    西安市节约检查委员会在五日召开了二十万人的动员大会，大张旗鼓地展开反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争。全市各区同时组织市民收听大会实况广播。
    大会上进行了坦白和检举。西安市人民政府税务局干部庞正义、李培文控诉引诱他们犯罪的奸商。有些不法商人也在会上坦白了他们行贿、盗窃国家资财的罪行。坦白不彻底的奸商，受到到会群众的质问和检举。大会设立的检举站收到群众检举奸商的信件达四千二百多件。
    大会最后由市节约检查委员会主任赵伯平作总结。他说：大会上许多被提名的奸商逾期不坦白者，便要受到法律制裁。他号召全市人民再接再厉，不打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻决不休止。
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团西北分团和朝鲜人民访华代表团西北分团全体人员应邀参加了大会。两分团的团长曲竟济、蔡亨默分别报告了志愿军和朝鲜人民军艰苦作战的情形。引起了全场热烈的掌声和欢呼。
    上海铁路管理局围剿大贪污犯
    上海铁路管理局现在已进入围剿大贪污犯的阶段。
    上海铁路管理局对于贪污分子采取了检查、检举，内外结合等多种多样方式来促使他们彻底坦白。该局除进行了各种动员报告外，还组织贪污分子坦白示范，召集已坦白的贪污分子和没有坦白的贪污分子举行座谈会。同时把坦白与检举、检查相结合，制服某些不肯老实坦白的贪污分子。这些都在对贪污分子的斗争中起了很大作用。
    目前该局正进一步到用钱最多的部门，和商人接触最多的部门和浪费最大的部门去找“老虎”。不把老虎打尽，决不罢休。
