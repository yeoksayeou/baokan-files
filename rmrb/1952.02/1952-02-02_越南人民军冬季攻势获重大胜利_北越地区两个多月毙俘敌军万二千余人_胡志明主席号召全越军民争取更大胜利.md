Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 31st: According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency in North Vietnam on January 29th: The General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army issued a communique on January 27th stating that since the French army launched a large-scale offensive against the Hoa Binh province region southwest of Hanoi on November 10th of last year, the Vietnamese People's Army has eliminated 89 enemy strongholds in the two months of fighting in North Vietnam. Among these, seven were eliminated through encirclement and persuasion. Additionally, over 400 puppet army strongholds were crushed or taken through persuasion; 2,200 puppet administrative organs were disbanded; and 12,350 enemy officers and soldiers were killed or captured, including three majors, nine captains, and twenty-six lieutenants. During the same period, the People's Army shot down 11 enemy aircraft, destroyed nine inland river vessels and small steamers, ten tanks, 169 armored vehicles and trucks, 21 artillery pieces of various calibers, and 16 machine guns, and destroyed 12 gasoline and ammunition depots. The People's Army seized 20 pieces of 57mm and 75mm artillery, 20 pieces of 81mm and 60mm mortars, 54 heavy machine guns, 138 light machine guns, 503 submachine guns, 59 radio stations, 30 tons of ammunition, and a large quantity of rifles and other military supplies.

General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, speaking at a press conference during the Lunar New Year, said about the importance of the autumn and winter victories: In the recent autumn and winter offensive battles, our army eliminated over 12,000 enemy troops, which is roughly equivalent to the total losses suffered by the enemy in various offensives against the coal mine area and the areas of Ha Nam province, Nam Dinh province, and Ninh Binh province last year. We have won great victories on the Black River and Hoa Binh fronts, annihilating many elite enemy units. At the same time, we have also won some equally important victories in the enemy's rear. Several million people have risen up to cooperate with our People's Army's main force and local troops to kill the enemy and defend their villages, liberating many areas in the enemy's rear and seriously undermining the enemy's plots of "using war to support war" and "using Vietnamese to fight Vietnamese."

General Vo Nguyen Giap said: The recent victories of the Vietnamese People's Army and the Vietnamese people on the North Vietnam front are the greatest victories in our resistance war since the autumn and winter border offensive of 1950. This victory, as well as the victories of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, has seriously undermined the aggressive conspiracies of international reactionaries and further consolidated the forces of peace and democracy in Asia. The annihilation of over 12,000 enemy troops by our army and the continuous attacks in the enemy's rear have seriously undermined de Tassigny's 1951 military plan.

General Vo Nguyen Giap continued: Highway 6 between Hanoi and Hoa Binh has been cut; Hoa Binh City has been besieged for 21 days; and the enemy is in dire straits on this front. If they want to withdraw from Hoa Binh, they will encounter a serious defeat; if they want to continue to defend it, they will encounter an even more serious defeat. Regardless of whether the enemy retreats or not, we will continue to carry out President Ho Chi Minh's orders, persist in fighting, and kill more enemies.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 30th: According to a Vietnam News Agency report from North Vietnam: Ho Chi Minh, Chairman of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, issued a letter to the Vietnamese people and military on the 27th.

In his letter to the people and military, Chairman Ho Chi Minh said: Last year, we made great progress. Economically, we established the State Bank of Vietnam, unified the management of economy and finance, and achieved good results in our production increase campaign. Militarily, after our army won victory in the border area in the autumn of 1950, it has launched five consecutive offensives, eliminating more than 38,000 enemy troops. We have also made some progress in other cultural and social undertakings.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh then pointed out: To win greater victories, we must closely unite with the fraternal peoples of Laos and Cambodia and the people of all countries who are fighting for independence, freedom, and peace; launch a production increase campaign; launch an enemy annihilation campaign and strengthen guerrilla warfare; and crush the enemy's conspiracies of "using Vietnamese to kill Vietnamese" and "using war to support war."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh finally called on the Vietnamese people and military to carefully study the instructions of the government and the Labor Party and strive for more brilliant victories in 1952.

    越南人民军冬季攻势获重大胜利  
    北越地区两个多月毙俘敌军万二千余人  
    胡志明主席号召全越军民争取更大胜利
    【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社北越二十九日讯：越南人民军总部在一月二十七日发表公报说：自从去年十一月十日法军向河内西南的和平省地区发动大规模的攻势以后，在北越的两个多月的战斗中，越南人民军共拔除了八十九处敌军据点，内有七处是用包围和劝告的办法拔除的，另外又粉碎或用劝告的办法取得了四百处以上的傀儡军据点；解散了二千二百处傀儡行政机关；击毙和俘掳了敌军官兵一万二千三百五十人，内有少校三人、上尉九人、中尉二十六人。在同一期间，人民军击落敌机十一架，击毁内河船只和小汽船九艘、战车十辆、装甲车和卡车一百六十九辆、各种口径的大炮二十一门和机枪十六挺，破坏汽油库和军火库十二处。人民军缴获的战利品计有五七公厘口径和七五公厘口径的大炮二十门、八一公厘口径和六○公厘口径的迫击炮二十门、重机枪五十四挺、轻机枪一百三十八挺、手提机枪五百○三挺、无线电台五十九部、弹药三十吨以及大量步枪与其他军用物资。
    越南人民军总司令武元甲将军在阴历新年举行记者招待会中，谈到这一次秋季和冬季胜利的重要意义时说：在最近的秋季和冬季的攻势战斗中，我军歼灭敌军一万二千人以上，约相当于敌军去年对煤矿区域内地以及河南省、南定省和宁平省区域发动各次攻势中所受的损失的总和。我们在黑水江与和平战线上已经赢得很大的胜利，歼灭了许多敌军的精锐部队。同时在敌人后方，也赢得了一些同样重要的胜利。好几百万人民都起来配合我们人民军的主力与地方部队共同杀敌和保卫他们的村庄，在敌人后方解放了许多地区，严重地破坏了敌人的“以战养战”和“利用越南人打越南人”的阴谋。
    武元甲将军说：越南人民军和越南人民最近在北越战线上的胜利，是自从一九五○年秋季和冬季的边境攻势以后，我们抗战中的最大的胜利。这个胜利以及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的胜利，已经严重地破坏了国际反动派的侵略阴谋，并进一步巩固了亚洲的和平民主力量。我军所歼灭的一万二千余名敌军以及在敌人后方的不断攻击，已经严重地破坏了塔西尼一九五一年的军事计划。
    武元甲将军接着说：河内与和平之间的第六号公路已被切断；和平城已被包围了二十一天；敌军在这条战线上已经处于困境。假若他们要想撤出和平，他们一定要遇到严重的失败，假若他们要想继续守下去，那么就要遇到更严重的失败。不管敌人是否撤退，我们还是要继续执行胡志明主席的命令，坚持战斗下去，杀死更多敌人。
    【新华社三十日讯】据越南通讯社北越消息：越南民主共和国政府主席胡志明在二十七日发表告越南全国军民书。
    胡志明主席在告全国军民书中说：在去年，我们获得很大的进步。在经济上，我们成立了越南国家银行，统一了经济和财政的管理，并在我们的增产竞赛运动中获得很好的成绩。在军事上，我们的军队于一九五零年秋季在边境地区获得胜利以后，已接连发动了五次攻势，歼灭敌军三万八千多人。在其他文化和社会事业等方面，我们也获得了一些进步。
    胡志明主席接着指出：要赢得更大的胜利，就必须紧密团结寮国、高棉兄弟民族以及为独立、自由与和平而斗争的各国人民；展开增产竞赛运动；展开歼敌竞赛和加强游击战争；粉碎敌人的“利用越南人杀越南人”和“以战养战”的阴谋。
    胡志明主席最后号召越南全国军民仔细研究政府和劳动党的指示，在一九五二年中争取更辉煌的胜利。
