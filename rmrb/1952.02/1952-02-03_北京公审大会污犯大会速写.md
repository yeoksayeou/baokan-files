    Quick Sketch of the Public Trial of Corrupt Officials in Beijing
    Shao Yu
    (1)
    The arch-corrupt official Xue Kunshan, this economic traitor who is different from capitalists and infiltrated our ranks; the arch-corrupt official Song Degui, this lackey of the bourgeoisie and traitor to the working class—their crimes are serious, and they refuse to confess, so they are sentenced to death.
    (2)
    The arch-corrupt officials Xia Maoru and Hang Xiaozu, because they were able to automatically and thoroughly confess and perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, are exempted from criminal punishment. When these two arch-corrupt officials walked off the stage after the verdict, a roar erupted from below the stage:
    Thorough confession and meritorious service to atone for crimes is the only way out for corrupt officials!
    Resolutely suppress corrupt officials who refuse to confess!
    Resolutely repel the bourgeoisie’s wild attacks! (Attached picture)

    邵宇
    （一）
    大贪污犯薛崑山，这个不同资本家，打入我们内部的经济内奸；大贪污犯宋德贵，这个资产阶级奴才和工人阶级的叛徒，他们罪恶严重，拒不坦白，被判处死刑。
    （二）
    大贪污犯夏茂如和杭效祖，因为他们能自动彻底地坦白，立功赎罪，免予刑事处分。当判决后，这两个大贪污犯走下台去的时候，台下响起一片吼声：
    彻底坦白立功赎罪是贪污犯唯一的出路！
    坚决镇压拒不坦白的贪污犯！
    坚决打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻！（附图片）
