    Fight to the End to Completely Destroy the Colonial System and Defend Lasting World Peace!
    Gao Ji
    In the current fierce struggle between the forces of war and peace, due to the growing strength of the world peace and democracy camp and the continuous failures of imperialist war policies, the struggles of the people of colonial and dependent countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to win independence and liberation and defend peace are flourishing. The crisis of the imperialist colonial system is becoming more acute and serious.
    Under this situation, in order to maintain their crumbling colonial system, imperialist countries are waging desperate colonial wars and bloody armed suppressions in many colonial countries and dependent countries in Asia and Africa. At the same time, in order to plunder new colonies, the United States is continuing its war of aggression against Korea, stepping up the armament of West Germany and Japan, and forcing other imperialist countries to frantically expand their armies and prepare for a new world war. This crazy war policy of the imperialist countries not only deepens the suffering of the people of colonial and dependent countries and seriously threatens world peace and security, but also makes Japan, a former imperialist country, completely reduced to a colony of the United States.
    However, the imperialist colonial and war policies are facing increasingly strong resistance and unprecedented failure.
    The brilliant victories won by the Chinese and Korean peoples fighting side by side on the Korean battlefield have completely shattered the United States' sinister plan to impose the shackles of the colonial system on the Korean people and disrupted the timetable of the US imperialist war. The victory of the Chinese and Korean peoples shows that the imperialist war plan to enslave the world can be completely defeated. This victory has continued to strengthen the forces of the world peace and democracy camp and seriously weakened the war forces of imperialism, while also facilitating the struggles of the people of colonial and dependent countries in Asia and Africa to win independence and liberation, and strengthening their confidence in victory.
    The Japanese people are waging a resolute struggle to defend peace and win independence and freedom for their motherland. The struggle of the Japanese people has received widespread sympathy and support from the people of China and the Soviet Union and the people of Asian countries. Under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party, an increasing number of Japanese patriotic people are joining the ranks of opposing the US-Japan separate "peace treaty" and opposing the US military occupation. This situation has hindered the plan of the US-Japanese reactionaries to rearm Japan on a large scale and expand the war of aggression in the Far East.
    At the same time, the armed struggles of the people of Southeast Asian countries are also developing victoriously. Their armed forces are growing stronger in the struggle, continuing to worsen the situation of imperialism in the colonial war and constantly suffering serious failures.
    In the war against the aggression of French and American imperialism, the Vietnamese people have firmly defended their republic. Since the border campaigns in the autumn and winter of 1950, the Vietnamese People's Army has continued to take the initiative to attack, launching five offensives in 1951 alone, annihilating 38,000 French troops and expanding the liberated areas. The heroic struggle waged by the Vietnamese people has forced the colonial army of French imperialism to shrink to less than one-tenth of the land of Vietnam, in a precarious situation.
    The war of liberation waged by the Malayan National Liberation Army and the Malayan people against British imperialism seriously threatens British colonial rule in Malaya. After suffering setbacks in the bloody colonial war, British imperialists even made McDonald, the British High Commissioner in Southeast Asia, admit that: "The situation in Malaya is more serious than at any time in the past three years."
    In the Philippines, the "model" colony of the United States, the active offensives of the People's Liberation Army have made it impossible for the Quirino puppet regime to parry.
    The democratic forces of the people of India, Indonesia, and Burma have also gradually grown stronger in the struggle against the imperialist war and colonial policies. The People's Democratic United Front, led by the Communist Party of India, has won important victories in the Indian general election.
    The situation in Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia is so unfavorable to the imperialist camp headed by the United States that their war and colonial policies have been severely hit and constantly defeated everywhere. Their colonial rule in this vast region has either been completely overthrown or is facing the fate of being overthrown. The era in which imperialism arbitrarily oppressed and exploited the people of colonial and dependent countries in the entire Asian region has fundamentally ended.
    In Southwest Asia and North Africa, the imperialist colonial rule is also in a precarious situation. The people of Iran, Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco have extensively launched struggles to recover sovereignty, strive for independence, and oppose imperialism. The struggles of the people of these countries are seriously striking at the imperialist plans to organize aggressive blocs, plunder war resources, and seize military bases in this region for war preparations. At present, the struggles of the Iranian and Egyptian people against imperialism are in a relatively difficult situation due to the shameless sabotage and crazy suppression of imperialism, as well as the betrayal and sale by the ruling groups of these countries. However, this will never frustrate the fighting courage of the patriotic people of Iran and Egypt, who are still carrying the banner of striving for independence and liberation and continuing to move forward.
    In the struggle against imperialism and for national independence and liberation, the people of various countries in Southwest Asia and North Africa have further united. The people of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Israel have all held large-scale demonstrations to support the struggles of the Iranian and Egyptian people. The heroic struggles of the people of Morocco and Tunisia have also received universal support from the people of other countries in Southwest Asia and North Africa, including Iran and Egypt. The flames of anger against the colonial system and the war of aggression are rapidly spreading in Southwest Asia and North Africa, thus seriously shaking the imperialist colonial rule in this region.
    The expansion of the national liberation movement of the colonial people in Southwest Asia and North Africa shows that the last bastion of the imperialist colonial system cannot be defended; the end of the entire colonial system is coming soon.
    In the far rear of US imperialism, the struggle of the people of Latin American countries to defend peace and strive for true national independence is also expanding and strengthening day by day. The barbarous plan of US imperialism to plunder war resources in Latin American countries is facing strong resistance from the people of various countries; the sinister conspiracy to collect cannon fodder for the war of aggression against Korea has been completely defeated. Despite the shameless sabotage of the reactionary governments of the United States and Brazil, peace fighters from the United States and Latin American countries are actively preparing for the American Peace Conference to strengthen the attack on the imperialist war plan.
    The imperialist plan to enslave the people of various countries and prepare for a new war is constantly suffering failures everywhere in the world; the struggle of the people of colonial and dependent countries to win independence and liberation and defend peace is on a new upsurge. In this struggle, the leadership of the Communist Parties and the working class of various countries is constantly being strengthened, the national united fronts of various countries are continuing to consolidate and expand, and the unity between the revolutionary people of various imperialist countries and the revolutionary people of colonial and dependent countries is becoming closer day by day. This unity of hundreds of millions of people is an invincible force that will lead imperialism and the colonial system to their death.
    The revolutionary forces of the people of various countries in the powerful world peace and democracy camp and the people of colonial and dependent countries have been increasingly closely combined. This is an invincible army against the colonial system and against the imperialist war of aggression; this army is advancing victoriously and will not stop until the imperialist colonial system is completely destroyed.
    The Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have completely smashed the shackles of imperialist enslavement and are victoriously carrying out the great construction of the motherland and the just struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea, stand closely with the people of all colonial and dependent countries in Asia and the world, and are willing to fight to the end to finally destroy the colonial system and defend lasting world peace.

    为彻底摧毁殖民制度、保卫世界持久和平而斗争到底！
    高集
    在当前战争与和平势力的激烈搏斗中，由于世界和平民主阵营力量日益强大，帝国主义战争政策不断遭受失败，从亚洲到非洲以及拉丁美洲的殖民地和附属国人民争取独立解放、保卫和平的斗争正在蓬勃发展，帝国主义殖民制度的危机是更加尖锐和严重了。
    在这种形势下，帝国主义国家为了维持其摇摇欲坠的殖民制度，正在亚洲和非洲的许多殖民地国家和附属国进行着绝望的殖民战争和血腥的武装镇压，同时为了掠夺新的殖民地，美国还在继续着侵略朝鲜的战争，加紧武装西德和日本，并迫使其他帝国主义国家疯狂地扩军备战，准备发动一次新的世界战争。帝国主义国家的这种疯狂的战争政策，不仅加深了殖民地和附属国人民的灾难，严重地威胁着世界的和平与安全，并且使以前的帝国主义国家日本，也已完全沦为美国的殖民地了。
    但是，帝国主义的殖民政策和战争政策正遭受着越来越为坚强的抵抗和空前的失败。
    中国人民和朝鲜人民在朝鲜战场上并肩作战所取得的辉煌胜利，彻底粉碎了美国将殖民制度的枷锁强加在朝鲜人民头上的罪恶计划，并打乱了美帝国主义的战争时间表。中朝人民的胜利，说明了帝国主义奴役世界的战争计划是完全可以被打败的。这一胜利继续加强了世界和平民主阵营的力量，并严重地削弱了帝国主义的战争势力，同时便利了亚洲和非洲殖民地与附属国人民争取独立解放的斗争，并坚定了他们胜利的信心。
    日本人民为保卫和平、争取自己祖国的独立和自由，正进行着坚决的斗争。日本人民的斗争，得到了中苏两国人民和亚洲各国人民普遍的同情和支持。在日本共产党的领导下，越来越多的日本爱国人民参加到反对美日单独“和约”和反对美国军事占领的队伍里来了。这种情形，已经使美日反动派大规模重新武装日本、扩大远东侵略战争的计划，受到了阻碍。
    与此同时，东南亚各国人民的武装斗争，也都在胜利地发展着。他们的武装力量在斗争中日益强大起来，使帝国主义在殖民战争中的境况继续恶化，并不断地遭受着严重的失败。
    越南人民在反对法美帝国主义的侵略战争中，巩固地保卫着自己的共和国，并自一九五○年秋季和冬季的边境战役以来，越南人民军即不断主动出击，仅在一九五一年即发动了五次攻势，歼灭法军三万八千人，扩大了解放区。越南人民所进行的英勇战斗，已使法国帝国主义的殖民军队不得不被迫龟缩在不足十分之一的越南土地上，处境岌岌可危。
    马来亚民族解放军和马来亚人民对英帝国主义所进行的解放战争，严重地威胁着英国在马来亚的殖民统治。英国帝国主义者在血腥的殖民战争中遭受到挫败后，甚至使英国驻东南亚高级专员麦克唐纳也不得不承认：“马来亚局势比过去三年中任何时候都要严重。”
    在美国的“模范”殖民地菲律宾，人民解放军的活跃攻势，也打得季里诺傀儡政权无法招架。
    印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸人民的民主力量，在反对帝国主义的战争政策和殖民政策的斗争中，也都逐渐强大起来了。印度共产党领导的人民民主统一阵线，在印度大选中已获得了重要的胜利。
    朝鲜、日本和东南亚的形势对于以美国为首的帝国主义阵营是如此的不利，它们的战争政策和殖民政策处处受到沉重的打击和不断的失败。它们在这个广大地区的殖民统治，或者已被完全推翻，或者正面临着被推翻的命运。帝国主义在整个亚洲地区任意压榨和剥削殖民地和附属国人民的时代已经根本结束了。
    在西南亚洲和北部非洲，帝国主义的殖民统治也正处在风雨飘摇之中。伊朗、埃及、突尼斯、摩洛哥的人民广泛地展开了收回主权、争取独立、反对帝国主义的斗争。这些国家人民的斗争，严重地打击着帝国主义在这个地区组织侵略集团、掠夺战争资源、攫取军事基地的备战计划。现在，伊朗和埃及人民反对帝国主义的斗争，虽然由于帝国主义的无耻破坏和疯狂镇压，以及这些国家的统治集团的叛变和出卖，而处于比较困难的情况下，但是这绝挫折不了伊朗、埃及爱国人民的斗争勇气，他们仍在高举着争取独立解放的旗帜继续前进。
    在反对帝国主义、争取民族独立解放的斗争中，西南亚洲和北部非洲的各国人民已进一步团结起来了。伊拉克、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、以色列人民都曾举行过声势浩大的示威游行，支援伊朗和埃及人民的斗争。摩洛哥、突尼斯人民前仆后继的英勇斗争，也得到了包括伊朗、埃及在内的西南亚洲和北部非洲其他各国人民的普遍声援和支持。反对殖民制度、反对侵略战争的怒火，正在西南亚洲和北部非洲迅速地扩展着，因而严重地动摇了帝国主义在这个地区的殖民统治。
    殖民地人民民族解放运动在西南亚洲和北部非洲的扩展，说明了帝国主义殖民制度的最后堡垒也无法据守了；整个殖民制度的末日快要到来了。
    在美国帝国主义的远后方，拉丁美洲各国人民保卫和平、争取国家真正独立的斗争，也正一天比一天扩大和加强起来。美帝国主义在拉丁美洲各国掠夺战争资源的野蛮计划，正遭受到各国人民的坚强抵抗；为侵略朝鲜战争搜罗炮灰的罪恶阴谋，并已遭受到完全的失败。美国和拉丁美洲各国的和平战士，不顾美国和巴西反动政府的无耻破坏，正积极筹备美洲和平大会，以加强对帝国主义战争计划的打击。
    帝国主义奴役各国人民、准备新战争的计划，在全世界各处都遭受着不断的失败；殖民地和附属国人民争取独立解放、保卫和平的斗争正在新的高涨中。在这一斗争中，各国共产党和工人阶级的领导正在不断加强，各国民族统一战线正在继续巩固和扩大，同时各帝国主义国家的革命人民和殖民地、附属国的革命人民之间的团结也一天比一天亲密。这种亿万人民的团结，是致帝国主义与殖民制度于死命的无敌力量。
    强大的世界和平民主阵营的各国人民和殖民地、附属国人民的革命力量，已日益紧密的结合起来了。这是一支反对殖民制度、反对帝国主义侵略战争的不可战胜的大军；这一支大军正在胜利进军，不到彻底摧毁帝国主义殖民体系决不休止。
    在中国共产党领导下已经彻底粉碎了帝国主义奴役枷锁，并胜利地进行着伟大祖国建设和抗美援朝正义斗争的中国人民，是紧密地与全亚洲和全世界殖民地、附属国人民站在一起的，并愿意为最后摧毁殖民制度、保卫世界持久和平而斗争到底。
