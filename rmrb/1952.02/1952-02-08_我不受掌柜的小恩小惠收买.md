I Will Not Be Bought Off by the Boss's Petty Favors
Li Genxiang (narrated), An Ruixia (recorded)

I am a member of the Youth League and a worker at the Yangfu Automobile Repair Factory in Beijing. Under the education of the Communist Party and the Youth League, I have firmly established my position and taken the lead in boldly exposing our boss.

The boss, Feng Yangfu, is a cunning profiteer. He has engaged in all sorts of illegal activities such as tax evasion, smuggling, and buying off gasoline. He has also seduced seventeen cadres from thirteen units. When repairing cars for outside parties, he often steals and replaces valuable parts. Stealing a set of bearings is worth more than one million yuan, and a radiator water tank is worth two and a half million yuan. The parts he stole are impossible to count. In addition, he lives a very corrupt life, indulging in eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling. He even smoked opium after liberation and lost bars of gold in gambling. He is extremely cruel to his apprentices, with no humanity whatsoever. Over the years, we have been terrified of him, and many fellow apprentices have been beaten and run away. Several people who remained at the counter had been beaten until their heads were bleeding. Everyone in the Nanheyan area knows that Boss Yangfu is particularly fierce and famous for beating his apprentices. To put it bluntly, he is simply a local tyrant!

I am considered the boldest in our factory. After liberation, I took the lead in joining the trade union and attending night school. The boss didn't dare to touch me too much, fearing that I would lead the workers to struggle against him. So he tried a softer approach. When he saw me, he would say, "Let me find you a partner!" When I introduced my brother to work in the factory, Feng Yangfu gave him particularly high wages. When my bicycle broke down, he quickly paid for the repairs. The young boss would try to win me over with small gestures, such as inviting me to meals, movies, and giving me ink. The boss intentionally courted those who were useful to him, so he also used soft tactics on the foremen and accountants. As for the rest, he dealt with them one by one, often stuffing some money into their hands after stealing parts and saying, "Work harder for me!"

We all knew about Feng Yangfu's misdeeds. But at that time, no one understood what state property was. We couldn't recognize ourselves as the working class. We all felt that workers in public factories were great, while workers in private factories were not. We looked down on ourselves, and many people wanted to go into business and become "bosses." I myself almost started a business with someone!

Every time the boss tried to win me over, I thought: I'll take the money, but I can't let you completely drag me down. What kind of stance is this? In this way, I was pulled over by the boss several times. If I weren't a member of the Youth League and hadn't received the League's education, I would have been dragged down completely.

Even though I wasn't completely dragged down by the boss, his petty favors became a heavy burden for me. So, when the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement began, I had many concerns. I thought: The boss has been "good" to me after all. Wouldn't exposing him make me an "ungrateful" person? Besides, if the boss goes to jail, we'll lose our jobs. Where will we go! The ideological struggle was very fierce, and I couldn't sleep at night.

After listening to Comrade Feng Wenbin's report, his words kept turning over in my mind: "Youth League members should participate in this movement with a fighting attitude. It is shameful to be afraid to expose!" This was the task given to me directly by the secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League. The more I thought about it, the more I felt sorry for the League. There were only two paths before me: one was not to expose him, not to be a member of the Youth League, and let the boss say that I had "conscience"; the other was to boldly expose him, to be a Youth League member without any falsehood, and to put all my strength into the struggle. I thought again of the suffering I had endured in the past. Looking at the present, thinking about the future, I also remembered what Comrade Feng Wenbin told us: "Nothing can hinder this movement!" Then, aren't these thoughts of mine hindering the movement? I am a member of the Youth League, a worker! The boss is "good" to me, but where does his money come from? It's all stolen! Stealing the state's money is stealing our money! It's not him who is supporting me; it's me who is supporting him! He's cutting a piece of meat from my body, turning around and giving me a sip of soup to drink, and wants me to thank him! I saw through the boss's conspiracy. No matter what he does, I have to expose him because he is fundamentally not on the same side as us!

At the beginning of the movement, the boss called us together for two "fact-finding meetings." He even wanted to give us double wages. I asked everyone: Do you know why the boss is giving us double wages? This question made everyone understand the boss's trick. At the meeting, Dai Jinkun raised the issue of the boss privately buying two large barrels (at least) of gasoline from the southward work team. Feng Yangfu denied it and threatened us with red eyes: "There wasn't that much! You have to take responsibility for what you say! Write down the names of those who said it!" Everyone was so frightened that they didn't dare to speak. I became angry and immediately took over, saying: "The boss is not honest, suppressing workers from exposing him. We won't hold meetings with him anymore. Let's hold group meetings in the trade union!" These few words really boosted everyone's morale. After the meeting, Zhang Changan wanted to expose him, but he had concerns because the boss had also given him money. I said, we can't ignore the interests of the country for this little bit of dirty money! I said: "We work hard all year round, groping for iron in the snow in winter, and peeling in the sun in summer. How much money do we earn in a year? The capitalists can make billions with one swoop! That's enough for us to work for several lifetimes!" The more we thought about it, the more we hated it, and we felt that we had to expose him. In addition, the trade union guaranteed that we wouldn't lose our jobs, so we became even bolder. In this way, we successively exposed twenty-three illegal acts of Feng Yangfu, totaling more than twenty million yuan.

We all know that the boss has many more illegal acts. Therefore, when the Beijing Municipal Commission for Thrift and Inspection came to the factory to check the accounts, we all put all our strength into supporting the government. Because now we know that the Communist Party is truly selfless and works for the people. Everyone also used their brains to think, comparing each item. Outsiders really couldn't find any loopholes in Feng Yangfu's account book. However, every car has been repaired by our hands, and everyone has an account in their hearts. As a result, many falsely reported accounts were exposed by us.

We finally won this battle! No one dared to expose him because of Feng Yangfu's threats, and no one was too embarrassed to fight him because of his favors. Because we are the working class! Even the accountant recognized this point and stood with us. Now the boss has been arrested. However, we are very stable, working as usual, and wages and bonuses are paid as usual. This is the guarantee given to us by the People's Government.

    我不受掌柜的小恩小惠收买
    李根祥述  安瑞霞记
    我是一个青年团员，是北京仰富汽车修理厂的工人。在共产党和青年团的教育下，我站稳立场，带头大胆检举了我们的掌柜的。
    掌柜的冯仰富是个狡猾的奸商。偷税、漏税、拉纤、收买汽油等什么违法事都干过。并曾先后勾引了十三个单位的十七个干部。给外边修理汽车时，他经常偷换贵重零件。随便偷下一套轴承，就值一百多万元，一个暖气水箱就值二百五十万元。他所盗窃的零件无法统计。另外，他生活很腐化，吃、喝、嫖、赌，样样都干。解放后还吸鸦片；赌钱一输就是几条金子。对徒弟非常狠，没一点人性。几年来，我们被他打怕了，好多师兄弟都被打跑。留在柜上的有好几个人，都曾被他打得头破血流。南河沿一带谁都知道仰富掌柜的特别凶，打徒弟出名。说得透一点，他简直是个恶霸！
    我们厂里还数我胆大。解放后我带头入工会，上夜校，掌柜的不太敢动我，怕我带动工人斗争他。于是就来软的。见到我就说：“给你找个对象吧！”我把兄弟介绍到厂子里干活，冯仰富特别多给工钱。我的自行车坏了，他赶紧拿钱修理。少掌柜的就从小处拉我，请吃饭啦，看电影啦，送墨水什么的。掌柜的是有意拉拢对他有用的人，所以对工头、管账先生也用软的。剩下的他就一个个地对付，时常在偷完零件以后塞给工人一点钱，还说：“多给我卖点力气！”
    冯仰富的这些坏事我们都知道。但是那时谁也不懂什么是国家财产。认不清自己是工人阶级。都觉得公营工厂的工人伟大，私营工厂的工人不伟大。看不起自己，很多人想去跑买卖，想当“掌柜的”。我自己就差点跟人合伙开了买卖！
    每次掌柜的拉我，我都这样想：给钱就要，反正我不能全被你拉走。这是什么立场呢？就这样，我被掌柜的拉过去好几次。假如我不是青年团员，没有团的教育，我早就全被他拖下水了。
    就是没有叫掌柜的拖下水去，可是他那点小恩小惠也成了我的大包袱。所以在反行贿、反偷税漏税运动一开始，我的顾虑可多啦。心想：掌柜的对我总算“不错”。检举他，不成了“忘恩负义”的人吗？再说，假如掌柜的坐了牢，我们失了业，到哪儿去呀！思想斗争得很厉害，晚上也睡不着。
    听了冯文彬同志的报告，他的话在我脑子里转开啦：“青年团员应当以战斗的姿态参加这个运动，不敢检举是可耻的！”这是青年团中央书记当面交给我的任务，我越想越觉得对不起团。眼前只有两条路：一是不检举，不当青年团员，让掌柜的说我有“良心”；一是大胆检举，一点不掺假地做青年团员，拿出全部力量来斗争。我又想起过去受的苦。看看现在，想想将来，又想起了冯文彬同志告诉我们的话：“什么东西都不能阻碍这个运动！”那么，我这些思想不就正在阻碍运动吗？我是青年团员，是工人！掌柜的对我“好”，他的钱哪儿来的？全是偷来的！偷国家的钱，就是偷我们的钱！不是他养活我，是我养活了他！是他从我身上割去一块肉，转过来送我一口汤喝，还要我谢谢他！我看穿了掌柜的阴谋，不管他怎么样，我也得检举，因为他根本就跟我们两条心！
    运动一开始，掌柜的就召集我们开了两次“摸底会”。还要给我们加双薪。我问大伙：你们知道掌柜的为什么给咱们加双薪？这一问，大家全明白了掌柜的诡计。在会上，戴金坤提出掌柜的私买南下工作团的两大桶（至少）汽油的事。冯仰富不承认，反红着眼威胁我们：“那里有那么多！讲出来得负责任！谁讲的把名字记下来！”吓得谁也不敢讲了。我气火了，马上接过来说：“掌柜的不坦白，压制工人检举，不跟他开会了，咱们工会开小组会去！”这几句话真给大家打气。散了会，张长安就要检举，可是他有顾虑，因为掌柜的也给过他钱。我说，不能为这点不干净的钱不管国家利益！我说：“咱们一年到头干活，冬天在雪里摸铁，夏天在太阳底下晒得脱皮，一年才挣多少钱？资本家们一搂就是多少亿！够咱们干几辈子的！”我们越想越恨，觉得非检举不可。再加上工会保证我们不失业，胆子更壮了。就这样我们先后检举了冯仰富二十三件违法的事，合两千多万元。
    我们都知道，掌柜的违法行为还很多。所以，当北京市节约检查委员会来厂查账时，我们都拿出全部力量来支持政府。因为现在我们知道共产党是真正大公无私，给人民办事的。大伙也都动脑筋想，念一笔，对一笔。冯仰富的那本账，外人实在查不出漏子来。可是，每辆车都是经过我们的手修的，个个心里都有本账，结果很多虚报的账都被我们兜出来了。
    这一仗我们到底打胜了！谁也没有因为冯仰富的威胁而不敢检举，没有因为他的拉拢而拉不下脸来和他斗争。因为我们是工人阶级！连管账先生也认清了这一点，和我们站在一起。现在掌柜的已经被捕。可是，我们非常安定，照样干活，工资、红利都是照样发的。这就是人民政府给我们的保证。
