The process by which the "Star Four Dinner Party" was uncovered by the People's Government powerfully demonstrates that no matter how tightly organized a bourgeois theft ring may be, it cannot escape the giant hand of the people. In August of last year, the Southwest Industrial Department discovered that a certain state-owned factory was consistently failing to meet its production targets, and the situation within the factory was extremely chaotic. Consequently, they dispatched an inspection team to the factory to investigate the work. After two months of investigation, they discovered serious issues such as unclear accounts, many substandard projects, and a failure to address delays in completing processing orders for private factories. When the inspection team inquired about the reasons for these issues with Zhou Shaowen, the production section chief of the factory's capital construction department, and Chen Songbai, an outside contractor engineer, they not only failed to reflect the true situation but also openly defended the private factories. Therefore, the inspection team concluded that the reason for the factory's failure to meet its production targets was not merely negligence on the part of general engineering personnel, but rather organized and planned sabotage.

The Southwest Industrial Department agreed with the inspection team's opinion and, building on the original inspection team, supplemented it with capable personnel to continue the "three checks" movement of checking accounts, checking finished products, and checking materials at the factory. After placing Chen Songbai, who was suspected of major corruption, under surveillance, Tang, the director of the machinery section of the Southwest Industrial Department, actually came forward to defend Chen Songbai, and Zhou Shaowen even lodged a protest. Certain personnel from the materials section, accounting section, and engineering section also came out to "guarantee" that Chen Songbai "had no problems." Through checking accounts and accusations from some employees within the factory, the inspection team finally discovered the "Star Four Dinner Party," secretly formed by certain engineering personnel and private merchants, which was engaged in organized and planned theft of state assets. Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, the Southwest Industrial Department promptly sent the case, along with Chen Songbai, Zhou Shaowen, and Zheng Zhiwu, to the Southwest Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate for handling. The Southwest Branch of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in conjunction with the Southwest Industrial Department and the Chongqing Municipal People's Procuratorate, respectively assigned specialized personnel to jointly handle this major case, conducting investigations while continuing the "three checks" movement within the factory.

After the launch of the anti-corruption and anti-bribery campaign, by January 23rd of this year, significant facts had been successively discovered regarding the "Star Four Dinner Party" and the collusion of personnel from the Southwest Railway Bureau and other units in stealing state property. The People's Government then arrested the ringleaders of the "Star Four Dinner Party," Gao Gongmao, Yin Renji, Zhou Yingbai, Li Hang, Liu Yusan, and Wen Renjie, and instructed Li Zhiqin, who had initially confessed to the crimes, and others to continue reflecting on their actions. Due to accusations from the broad masses, the peripheral organizations of the "Star Four Dinner Party," such as the "Star Five Dinner Party," the "Star Six Dinner Party," the "Eleventh Factory Liaison Office," the "Shipbuilding Group," and the "Accountant Forum," were also successively uncovered, and the entire case was thus thoroughly solved.

    重庆市破获“星四聚餐会”经过
    “星四聚餐会”被人民政府破获的经过，有力地说明了资产阶级任何严密的盗窃集团，都逃不出人民的巨掌的。去年八月，西南工业部发现国营某工厂经常不能完成生产任务，厂内情况非常混乱，于是派遣了检查组，到这个工厂去检查工作。经过两个月的检查，发现这个工厂中存在着账目不清、很多工程不合规格、对私营工厂拖延加工定货的完工日期不加处理等严重现象。检查组向该厂基本建设处生产科长周绍文、外包工程师陈松柏探询产生这种现象的原因，周等不仅不反映真实情况，反而公开替私营工厂辩护。因此，检查组断定这个工厂不能完成生产任务的原因，绝不是一般的工程人员玩忽职守，而是有人在进行有组织、有计划的破坏行动。
    西南工业部同意检查组的意见，并在原检查组的基础上，补充得力人员，继续到那个工厂开展查账目、查成品、查材料的“三查”运动。检查组把有重大舞弊嫌疑的陈松柏加以看管之后，西南工业部机械处处长唐某居然出面为陈松柏辩护，周绍文竟提出抗议，材料科、会计科和工程科的某些人员，也出来“保证”陈松柏“没有问题”。经过查账和厂内某些职工的检举，检查组终于发现了该厂某些工程人员和私商秘密组成的“星四聚餐会”，有组织、有计划地盗窃国家资财。西南工业部认识到这一情况的严重性，即将原案连同陈松柏、周绍文、郑志武三人，一并送交最高人民检察署西南分署处理。最高人民检察署西南分署会同西南工业部和重庆市人民检察署，分别调配专门人员，共同处理这一重大案件，一面侦察，一面在厂内继续开展“三查”运动。
    反贪污反行贿运动开始后，到今年一月二十三日止，陆续发现“星四聚餐会”和西南铁路局等单位工作人员互相勾结盗窃国家财产的重大事实，人民政府遂将“星四聚餐会”的首脑分子高功懋、印仁基、周英柏、李杭、刘雨三、闻人杰六人逮捕，并指令初步坦白了犯罪事实的李志亲等继续反省。由于广大群众的检举，又陆续破获“星四聚餐会”的外围组织“星五聚餐会”、“星六聚餐会”、“十一厂联络处”、“造船小组”、“会计师座谈会”等组织，全案至此遂彻底破获。
