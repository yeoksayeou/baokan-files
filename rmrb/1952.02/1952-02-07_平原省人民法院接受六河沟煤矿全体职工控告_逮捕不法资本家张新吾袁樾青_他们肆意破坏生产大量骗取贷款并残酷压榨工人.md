The People's Court of Pingyuan Province accepted the lawsuit from all employees of the Liuhegou Coal Mine, the Pingyuan Provincial Department of Industry, the Pingyuan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China, and other units against the unlawful capitalists of the Liuhegou Coal Mine, Zhang Xinwu (Chairman of the Board) and Yuan Yueqing (Advisor to the Board). On January 28th, Zhang Xinwu and Yuan Yueqing were arrested and brought to justice.

Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Liuhegou Coal Mine was operated by private capital and had more than 10,000 workers. During the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, some bureaucratic capital participated in it. In 1947, when the People's Liberation Army liberated Liuhegou, the capitalists fled, and the local democratic government took over the coal mine and restored production. In accordance with the policy of protecting national capital, the People's Government returned it to the original capitalists for operation at the end of 1949. Although Zhang Xinwu, Yuan Yueqing, and others had the support of the People's Government and the help of the workers, they did not actively engage in production, but repeatedly sabotaged production, destroyed national resources, and deducted workers' wages; and under the guise of restoring production, they fraudulently obtained state loans. Over the past two years, their crimes have been as follows:

1.  Stealing and selling machinery, destroying production. Zhang Xinwu, Yuan Yueqing, and others did not contribute a single cent when they took over the coal mine. At that time, the People's Government, in line with the policy of supporting private industry, still loaned 350 million yuan to the coal mine, even under extremely difficult financial conditions. The workers, without welfare facilities and with the capitalists in arrears with their wages, repeatedly exercised restraint for their own long-term interests and actively helped the capitalists overcome difficulties and restore production. As a result, coal production rapidly increased by 20% compared to before. In terms of saving raw materials, the daily savings on wooden pillars alone amounted to more than 900 catties of millet. However, Zhang Xinwu, Yuan Yueqing, and others had no intention of engaging in production at all. Under the pretext of capital exhaustion, they sold off equipment in large quantities, destroying production. In 1950, they sold more than 20,000 catties of light railway tracks, three small locomotives, more than 100,000 catties of scrap iron, 4,000 catties of iron cans, more than 10,000 catties of pig iron, as well as electric car hooks and other items. More seriously, they even smashed and sold the machines that the state had entrusted to them for safekeeping. They also felled more than 600 trees in the mine, and demolished more than a dozen train sheds and more than 20 workers' dormitories. In addition, they also attempted to dismantle the lead sheet roofing of the motor rooms and workers' dormitories for sale, and planned to smash two 25-kilowatt and 50-kilowatt generators and sell them as pig iron, but were stopped by the workers and the government.

2.  Violating the Mining Law and destroying coalfields. When the government handed over the mine, in view of the lack of fuel at that time and the lack of capacity of the capitalists to invest in expanding production, they were only allowed to mine in the South Inclined Pit transferred by the Fengfeng Mining Bureau in order to ensure that workers had work and their lives were guaranteed; at the same time, the coalfield was protected. However, Zhang Xinwu, Yuan Yueqing, and others only sought private gain, digging small wells indiscriminately, destroying the restoration of the large mine, and wasting the country's coalfields. After several prohibitions by the government, they did not stop their destructive activities until the end of last year.

3.  Violating government decrees and refusing to register the public shares and company bonds in the mine, attempting to deceive the government and conceal assets.

4.  Obtaining loans by fraud under the pretext of restoring the large well. In August 1951, Zhang Xinwu and others fraudulently obtained a loan of 500 million yuan from the People's Bank under the pretext of restoring the large well and solving the difficulties in the off-season operation. After obtaining the loan, they did not use it for production or pay workers' wages, but squandered it arbitrarily. The well restoration construction plan was nowhere in sight. The loan was more than two months overdue and had not been repaid.

5.  Destroying the "Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit" policy and cruelly exploiting workers. Zhang Xinwu, Yuan Yueqing, and others only cared about making money and enjoying themselves, regardless of the life and death of the workers. In terms of production, there was no necessary power equipment or safety equipment. Accidents and injuries occurred repeatedly, and they ignored them. There was no guarantee of workers' life and safety. In terms of labor welfare, they not only did not try to improve it, but also canceled the original welfare benefits. For example, there were previously regulations to subsidize workers' rent and lamp oil, but these were all canceled by Zhang, Yuan, and others. Hundreds of workers had only one bathhouse, which was made of a coal cart and could only hold 1,000 catties of water. The hospital's equipment was even worse. The wooden boards of the beds had two-finger-wide gaps, covered with a mat; the wind blowing through from under the bed made the patients' waists and legs ache. Workers were reluctant to stay in the hospital when they were injured or sick due to work. The workers said, "Staying in the hospital is like entering the palace of the King of Hell!" The capitalists did not pay workers' wages for a long time. For example, the wages for the three months from October to December last year were not paid at all. When the workers urged them, they deceived the workers and kept pushing it back. The workers could no longer bear it and sent representatives to the Anyang Prefectural Labor Section in late December to file a complaint. On December 23, the capitalists' representative, Li Guanjun, signed a guarantee to pay off all the wages owed by the end of December. However, these deceitful guys ran off to Hankou after signing the guarantee and never returned. Under these circumstances, workers were forced to hang themselves, and their families were broken up. For example, technical worker Han Shuangxi was sick due to work, and the capitalists did not pay his wages, so he owed too much money, and no one on the east and west streets would lend him money anymore, forcing him to hang himself. Fortunately, he was rescued and did not die. Technical worker Han Guiliang was sick due to work and stayed in the hospital. The capitalists did not pay his wages, and his family of five had no food to eat, so he had to sell his own son. Worker Li Yunbin was so poor that he had no food to eat, and his wife divorced him.

During the two years that Zhang Xinwu and others operated the Liuhegou Coal Mine, they made a total profit of more than 2.3 billion yuan, plus more than 210,000 catties of millet from the stolen sale of equipment (not including the profits of the coke plant). But the capitalists who harmed others to benefit themselves and only cared about profit did not invest anything in the construction of the factory. They disregarded the life and death of the workers and took all the fruits of the workers' labor and state loans to Beijing, Hankou, and other places to squander.

The unlawful behavior of Zhang Xinwu, Yuan Yueqing, and others aroused the anger of the workers of the Liuhegou Coal Mine. In order to protect production and the interests of the workers, the People's Court of Pingyuan Province accepted the lawsuit from all the workers of the Liuhegou Coal Mine and the Provincial Department of Industry and other units against Zhang Xinwu and Yuan Yueqing, and arrested and brought the two criminals to justice.

    平原省人民法院接受六河沟煤矿全体职工控告
    逮捕不法资本家张新吾袁樾青
    他们肆意破坏生产大量骗取贷款并残酷压榨工人
    平原省人民法院接受六河沟煤矿全体职工及平原省工业厅、中国人民银行平原省分行等单位对违法的六河沟煤矿资本家张新吾（董事长）袁樾青（董事会顾问）的控告，一月二十八日把张新吾、袁樾青逮捕法办。
    六河沟煤矿在抗战以前为私人资本经营，有一万多工人。在日寇及国民党统治时期，有一部分官僚资本参加进去。一九四七年人民解放军解放六河沟时，资本家逃跑了，当地民主政权便接管了这个煤矿，恢复生产。人民政府根据保护民族资本的政策，于一九四九年底把它交还了原资本家经营。张新吾、袁樾青等虽有人民政府的扶助和工人的帮助，但他们并不积极经营生产，反而屡次破坏生产，破坏国家富源，克扣工人工资；并在恢复生产的名义下，骗取国家贷款。两年多来，他们的罪行如下：
    一、盗卖机器，破坏生产。张新吾、袁樾青等接管煤矿时，未拿分文。当时，人民政府本着扶植私营工业的政策，虽在财政情况十分困难的条件下，仍先后贷款三亿五千万元给这个煤矿。工人们在没有福利设施、资方拖欠工资的条件下，为了自己的长远利益，一再忍让，积极帮助资方克服困难，恢复生产。因此，煤产量迅速地较前提高百分之二十。在节省原材料上，仅木柱一项，每天节省所值，折合小米九百多斤。但是，张新吾、袁樾青等，根本没心经营生产。他们藉口资本枯竭，大批出卖器材，破坏生产。在一九五○年内，他们卖掉轻便铁道二万多斤，小火车头三个，碎铁十万多斤，铁罐四千斤，灰生铁一万多斤，以及电车钩背、大小涨圈等。更严重的，他们竟把国家托他们代管的机器也砸坏卖掉了。他们又砍伐矿山林木六百多株，拆火车棚十几间、工人宿舍二十多间。此外，他们还企图拆电机房和工人宿舍屋顶的铅皮变卖，并准备把二十五瓩五十瓩的两个发电机砸碎当生铁卖掉，但被工人和政府制止了。
    二、违反矿山管理法，破坏煤田。政府移交的时候，鉴于当时燃料并不缺乏，而且资方又没有能力投资扩大生产，于是只准他们在峰峰矿务局移交的南斜坑开采，以保证工人有工做，生活得到保证；同时也保护了煤田。但是，张新吾、袁樾青等只图私利，乱开小井，破坏大矿的恢复，蹧蹋国家的煤田，经政府几次禁止，直到去年年底才停止破坏活动。
    三、违反政府法令，拒绝登记矿内公股财产和公司债，企图蒙蔽政府，隐匿财产。
    四、藉口恢复大井，骗取贷款。一九五一年八月间，张新吾等藉口恢复大井及解决淡月经营中的困难，骗取人民银行贷款五亿元。他们骗得贷款后，不用在生产上，不发给工人工资，却任意挥霍。复井施工计划毫无着落。贷款过期两月有余，还没归还。
    五、破坏“劳资两利”政策，残酷地压榨工人。张新吾、袁樾青等，只管自己赚钱享受，不管工人死活。在生产上，没有应有的动力设备和安全设备。伤亡事故屡次发生，他们置之不理，工人生命安全没有任何保证。在劳动福利方面，他们不仅不设法改进，反而把原有的福利取消了。如过去曾经有给工人补助房租及灯油的规定，但都被张、袁等取消了。数百工人只有一个澡塘，还是用推炭罐改成的，只能容一千斤水。医院的设备更差。病床的木板有二指宽的缝，上面铺着一领席；从床下透过的风，吹得病人腰疼腿酸。工人因工受伤或患病时，都不愿住医院。工人说：“住了医院，就像进了阎王殿！”资方长期不发给工人工资。如去年十月到十二月的三个月工资，一文未发。工人督促的时候，他们就欺骗工人，一推再推。工人忍无可忍，在十二月下旬派代表到安阳专署劳动科去控告。十二月二十三日，资方代表李冠军才签字保证在十二月底以前发清全部所欠工资。但是，这些骗人的家伙，签字后就跑到汉口去不回来了。在这种情况下，迫得工人上吊，妻离子散。如技术工人韩双喜，因工有病，资本家不发工资，因而欠钱太多，东街西街再没人借钱给他了，迫得他上了吊，幸被人救下才没有死。技术工人韩贵良因工有病，住在医院里，资本家不发工资，全家五口人没饭吃，不得不把亲生的儿子卖掉。工人李云彬穷得没有饭吃，妻子跟他离婚了。
    张新吾等经营六河沟煤矿的二年多中，共得利润二十三亿多元，还有盗卖器材得的二十一万多斤小米（焦炭厂的利润不在内）。但损人利己，唯利是图的资本家对建厂事业一点也没有进行。他们不顾工人的死活，把工人的劳动果实和国家贷款，通统拿到北京、汉口等地去挥霍了。
    张新吾、袁樾青等的不法行为，引起了六河沟煤矿工人的愤怒。平原省人民法院为了保护生产及工人利益，接受六河沟煤矿全体工人和省工业厅等单位对张新吾、袁樾青的控告，把张、袁两犯逮捕法办。
