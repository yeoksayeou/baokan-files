Anshan City's Private Iron Industry "Eight Great Families"
    Organized and Planned Attack on State Organs
    Stealing Hundreds of Millions of Yuan of State Assets, Principal Offenders Arrested

    After half a month of fierce attack by all the staff of the Anshan City People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau and the people of the city on major grafters and major thieves, the major case of the private iron industry's "Eight Great Families" stealing state property worth 10 billion yuan in the name of the "Anshan City Private Iron Industry Joint Production Office" has been completely solved. The principal offenders, Mao Jingbo, acting section chief of the former Industry and Commerce Bureau's Production Enterprise Section, technician Zhai Huafeng, Zhang Ziming, manager of the private Jianguo Iron Factory, Chang Shouyi, manager of Yicheng Iron Factory, Wang Shishan, manager of Yushan Iron Factory, and other criminals, have been arrested by the People's Government and will be severely punished according to law.

    The criminal activities carried out by unscrupulous capitalists in the name of the "Anshan City Private Iron Industry Joint Production Office" began in July 1950. At that time, in order to enable the 122 iron industries in the city to develop in a balanced manner, the government established a Production Enterprise Section in the Municipal Industry and Commerce Bureau to uniformly allocate government-entrusted processing and orders. This measure was extremely unfavorable to the "Eight Great Families" who were accustomed to speculation and opportunism. They secretly united together, first pulling over Mao Jingbo, the acting section chief of the former Production Enterprise Section, and then sending in Zhai Huafeng, a technician from the Jianguo Iron Factory, and others, and then forming a general headquarters for internal and external collusion, monopolizing processing and ordering, squeezing out small and medium-sized factories, and stealing state property. Their specific activities are:

    1. The "undercover agents" who were pulled over and sent in usurped the power to "review and approve" contracts, uniformly overestimating labor costs and over-receiving materials. According to preliminary statistics, they embezzled state property worth 4.4 billion yuan in nine projects. Among them, in the switch project alone, the project consumption rate was over-reported by 15 percent, and 190 tons of steel plates were over-received, causing the state property to lose 1.2 billion yuan.

    2. During the progress of the project, they organized and planned to cut corners. For example, in November 1950, when processing a certain project, they stole and deceived more than 500 million yuan by simply replacing good materials with waste materials and reporting more than they used.

    3. Large-scale wooing and bribing of staff, and forging various seals and issuing fake invoices, thereby stealing and evading a large amount of state tax. According to incomplete statistics, the "Eight Great Families" wooed more than 200 staff members in total. Among them, Zhang Ziming, manager of Jianguo Iron Factory alone, wooed more than 30 people and forged 24 kinds of seals, and once stole and evaded 300 million yuan of state tax.

    4. Through the "Joint Production Office", they monopolized processing and ordering by means of "deadline" and "non-disclosure of prices", so that many small and medium-sized factories were shut down under their squeeze, causing extreme chaos in the production order.

    5. In order to steal state property and obtain huge profits, they resisted the government by means of threats. Seeing that they could not get huge profits in a certain project of the Anshan City Oxygen Plant and the tight wire bolt project of a certain department, they not only refused to do it themselves, but also, in the name of the "Joint Production Office", forbade other small and medium-sized factories to do it, causing great losses to the state.

    After the launch of the anti-corruption and anti-theft campaign, they united together again, held secret meetings frequently, spread rumors, attacked employees' reports, and made a "defense alliance", with vows such as "heads can be broken, blood can flow, friendship cannot be lost", to resist. However, under the siege of all the staff of the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the broad masses of the people, their conspiracies and tricks were finally exposed, and their criminal activities were also exposed one by one. When the principal offenders who carried out this illegal organizational activity were arrested by the People's Government, the people of the city, including small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, all applauded.

    鞍山市私营铁工业“八大家”
    有组织有计划地进攻国家机关
    盗窃国家资财百亿元，主犯已被逮捕
    鞍山市人民政府工商局全体职工和全市人民，经过半个月对大贪污犯和大盗窃犯的猛烈围攻，已完全破获私营铁工业“八大家”以“鞍山市私营铁工业联合生产处”名义，有组织有计划地盗窃国家财产达人民币百亿元的重大案件。主犯前工商局生产企业科代理科长毛静波、技师翟华封、私营建国铁工厂经理张子明、义成铁工厂经理常守义，玉山铁工厂经理王世山等犯，已由人民政府逮捕，将依法严办。
    不法资本家借“鞍山市私营铁工业联合生产处”名义进行的罪恶活动，是在一九五○年七月开始的。那时政府为使全市一百二十二户铁工业平衡地发展，便在市工商局成立了生产企业科，以便统一分配政府的委托加工和定货。这一措施对于习惯投机取巧的“八大家”极为不利，他们便暗地联合在一起，先把前生产企业科的代理科长毛静波拉过去，再把建国铁工厂的技师翟华封等派进来，然后组成里应外合、垄断加工定货、排挤中小工厂、盗窃国家财产的总指挥部。他们的具体活动是：
    一、由拉过去和派进来的“坐探”，篡夺“审核批准”合同的大权，统一高估工价和多领材料。据初步统计，他们在九项工程中，就窃取国家财产达人民币四十四亿元。其中仅道岔子一项工程，就多报工程消耗率百分之十五，多领钢板一百九十吨，使国家财产损失人民币十二亿元。
    二、在工程进行过程中，有组织有计划地偷工减料。如一九五○年十一月在进行某项工程加工时，仅用废料换好料和以多报少的办法，就盗骗了人民币五亿多元。
    三、大规模地拉拢、收买工作人员，并伪造各种印章，假开发票，从中大量偷漏国税。据不完全的统计，“八大家”共计拉拢工作人员二百多名。其中建国铁工厂经理张子明一人，即拉拢三十余人，并伪造印章二十四种，从中一次就偷漏国税人民币三亿元。
    四、通过“联合生产处”，用“限期”、“不公布价格”等手段，垄断加工定货，以致许多中小工厂都在他们排挤下歇业，造成生产秩序的极度混乱。
    五、为了偷盗国家财产，获取暴利，他们以威胁的手段，来抗拒政府。他们看到在鞍山市氧气厂的某工程和某部的紧电线锣丝工程中，得不到暴利，他们不但自己不作，并且还以“联合生产处”名义，不准其他中小工厂作，使国家遭受极大的损失。
    在反贪污反盗窃运动展开以后，他们又联合在一起，经常举行秘密会议，散布谣言、打击职工检举，订立“攻守同盟”，以“头可断，血可流，朋友义气不可丢”等誓言，进行抗拒。但在工商局全体人员和广大人民的围攻下，他们的阴谋诡计终于被揭穿，他们的罪恶活动也被一一检举出来。当进行这一非法组织活动的主犯被人民政府逮捕以后，全市人民，包括中、小工商业者在内，都一致称快。    （东北日报）
