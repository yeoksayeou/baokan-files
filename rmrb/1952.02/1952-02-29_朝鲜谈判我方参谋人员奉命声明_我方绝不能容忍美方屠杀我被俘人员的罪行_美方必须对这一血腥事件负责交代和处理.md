    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 28th: At the staff meeting on the third item of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 28th, the other side continued to reject our side's reasonable solutions on the issues of rotation and ports, as well as the nomination of neutral nations, without any reason, and the meeting made no progress.
    At the staff meeting on the fourth item, our staff solemnly pointed out that the other side's attempt to evade the serious responsibility for the Koje Island incident of slaughtering our captured personnel with unreasonable excuses and shameless public lies would never succeed. We absolutely cannot tolerate this barbaric and brutal crime. The people of the world will never forgive this barbaric and brutal crime. Our staff are instructed to declare: Our side finds the other side's reply on the 27th completely unsatisfactory. The other side must provide a responsible explanation and handling of this bloody massacre incident.

    【新华社开城二十八日电】二十八日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，对方继续毫无理由地拒绝我方在轮换和口岸问题以及中立国提名上所提出的合理解决方案，会议毫无进展。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，我方参谋人员严正指出对方企图以毫无理由的藉口和恬不知耻的当众撒谎，来逃避其屠杀我方被俘人员的巨济岛事件的严重责任，是决不能达到目的的。我方绝对不能容忍这一野蛮残暴的罪行。全世界人民绝不能饶恕这一野蛮的残暴的罪行。我方参谋人员奉命声明：我方对对方二十七日的答复，认为完全不能满意。对方必须对这一血腥的屠杀事件，作负责的交代与处理。
