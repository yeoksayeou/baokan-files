    Oppose Actors' Arbitrary Distortion of the People's Government's Policies
    To the Editor: In Hengyang, many rural theater troupes and amateur theater troupes' actors often disregard the plot and only try to make the audience laugh when performing. They speak carelessly on stage, making a mess of things, which results in damaging the plot and even distorting the policies of the People's Government, causing some audience members to misunderstand the policies. For example, when I was studying at a land reform training class, I saw a double act promoting the Land Reform Law at the graduation party. The actors said, "I am a single man, and now with land reform, I can get a wife." They also said, "So-and-so landlord's daughter-in-law is beautiful, I must marry her." Such absurd lines are so bad that they slander the policies of the People's Government. Furthermore, a performing troupe staged "The Abandoned Child of the Mill" in Chashi, Xiangongbao, Maoping and other places, including a scene where students carry benches to beat the teacher's buttocks, which has a very bad impact on the audience. Many viewers said after watching, "Now teachers don't beat students, but in the future students will beat teachers. It's really impossible to be a teacher!" These phenomena are intolerable and must be resolutely opposed. It is hoped that theater troupes in Hengyang and other places will pay attention to correcting these phenomena.

    反对演员任意歪曲人民政府的政策
    编辑同志：衡阳有许多农村剧团和业余剧团的演员们，演戏的时候，常常不顾剧情，只顾逗引观众发笑。他们在台上信口开河，乱说一通，结果破坏了剧情，甚至歪曲了人民政府的政策，引起某些观众对政策的误解。如我在土地改革讲习班学习的时候，在结业晚会上，看到有一幕宣传土地改革法的双簧，演员说：“我是单身公，现在土地改革，我可以分到一个老婆了。”还说：“某地主的媳妇生得好，我一定讨她。”像这种荒谬的台词，已经恶劣到诬蔑人民政府的政策的程度了。再如有一个演剧队在茶市、相公堡、茅坪等地演出“磨房弃子”，其中有一段是学生背板凳打老师的屁股，对观众影响坏极了。许多观众看了后，说：“现在老师不打学生，将来学生就要打老师，做老师的真没有办法！”这些现象是不能容忍的，必须坚决反对。希望衡阳和其他各地剧团注意纠正这些现象。
