Han Peisen and Colluding Profiteers: A Major Case of Embezzlement and Theft
Ji Liang

In November 1950, the Southwest Branch of the Capital Construction Engineering Department of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government hired a new construction worker. This construction worker was somewhat different from ordinary staff, paying attention to extravagance, ostentation, and spending money like water. He often invited comrades to watch movies, eat snacks, and dance, to show his "generosity," and was extremely flattering to the leading comrades. The department, from top to bottom, always believed that this new construction worker had "skills," knew how to handle things, and was truly "not bad," so they quickly promoted him from construction worker to engineering team leader. This construction worker was the weevil—Han Peisen—who had planned to infiltrate the department to steal state property.

Han Peisen was originally a construction contractor and a habitual embezzler. After liberation, he applied the same tricks of embezzlement, bribery, and theft of state property from the Kuomintang era to the new society without any changes. When he came to the engineering department, he thought this was the best opportunity to get rich, and he tried every possible means to find his old partners from his days in the construction business: Li Jiewen (manager of Huafeng Construction Company), Zhao Shuda (manager of Hexingcheng Construction Company), Zhong Dezhang (manager of Ni Yuji Construction Company), Zhuang Maobin (deputy manager of Ni Yuji Construction Company), Lin Fo (deputy manager of Dacheng Timber Company), and other profiteers to form a major embezzlement group, preparing to attack the Capital Construction Engineering Department—to steal a large amount of state property. Han Peisen was responsible for the inside work. First, he used money and sex as "bait" to lure, entice, and corrupt staff. Under this conspiracy, some staff members became his "captives" or accomplices. After Han Peisen had a "basic mass," he further implemented insidious schemes and attacked leading cadres. The cunning and shrewd Han Peisen saw the weakness of the engineering department at a glance: Deputy Director Liu Taichen was a high-ranking bureaucrat, and the power was completely in the hands of the "eloquent" chief engineer Xiang Junzhi. Han Peisen began to launch a fierce attack on Xiang Junzhi. Xiang Junzhi was hit by the sugar-coated bullets without realizing it and thought that Han Peisen was "amiable" and spoke pleasantly. Therefore, he often praised Han Peisen in front of Deputy Director Liu Taichen. Comrade Liu Taichen also believed that Han Peisen was a rare "talent" in construction engineering and followed him in everything. Han Peisen saw that his initial plan was successful, and he proceeded to the second step, introducing Xiang Junzhi and the capable cadres of the engineering department, Xu Qinshan and Li Fangbo, to Li Jiewen, Zhuang Maobin, and others. When the profiteers first contacted Xiang Junzhi, they did not dare to act recklessly, first using dinners or Peking Opera as a way to test the waters. Li and Zhuang were both extremely cunning and wicked merchants, specializing in enticing cadres. They saw that Xiang Junzhi was lecherous, so they invited Xiang Junzhi to dance and found dancing girls and singers to accompany him. However, Xiang Junzhi, on the other hand, wanted to pretend to be "pure." He believed that playing with dancing girls could only be done in the ballroom. If he brought the dancing girls out to meet friends, he would lose his "status." After the profiteers knew this, in order to cater to Xiang Junzhi, they called Ke Zhongxiu, the younger sister of the concubine of Lin Fo, the deputy manager of Dacheng Timber Company, from Luzhou to Chongqing to introduce her to Xiang Junzhi as a "friend." When introducing Ke Zhongxiu to Xiang Junzhi, they had Ke Zhongxiu wear a school badge of a certain university and falsely claimed that Ke Zhongxiu was a "high achiever" from a certain university. In this way, Xiang Junzhi completely disarmed. But the profiteers were still not at ease. They were afraid that Ke Zhongxiu alone could not capture Xiang Junzhi, so Zhuang Maobin, the deputy manager of Ni Yuji Construction Company, had his wife, Zhou Huiying, personally take the field to assist Ke Zhongxiu in seducing Xiang Junzhi. Xiang Junzhi thought they were too considerate to him, so he had to serve the profiteers and shamelessly joined the major embezzlement group organized by the profiteers. Other staff members such as Xu Qinshan and Li Fangbo also suffered the same fate as Xiang Junzhi, were hit by the profiteers' arrows, became captives, or joined this embezzlement group.

The profiteers' plan was insidious, preparing to "catch all" the personnel of the engineering department. After paralyzing the leading cadres of the engineering department and buying off the general capable cadres, they used this relationship to vigorously deploy forces within the engineering department. They hired a large number of dancing girls, singers, and prostitutes at high prices to infiltrate the interior, specializing in enticing and corrupting cadres. For example, Ke Zhongxiu and two other dancing girls were introduced to the first engineering team as "instructors" to lead the workers' political studies; Li Shuhua, a singer from the "Empress Cabaret," became an "instructor" for the Sanjinyuan engineering team; Cai Tianyu, a singer from the "Empress Cabaret," became a "worker" for the ninth engineering team; and even Han Peisen's own wife was sent to the engineering department to "work." The profiteers' means of enticing and corrupting cadres were extremely vicious. For example, Yuan Zhong, a materialman at the Beibei construction site, began to stop the profiteers' illegal acts of stealing state property. The profiteers hired a woman to accompany Yuan Zhong all the time. In this way, Yuan Zhong became corrupted and degenerate and also became an embezzler. A large number of cadres were thus corrupted by the "beauty trap" deployed by the profiteers. Subsequently, the profiteers sent their relatives, brothers-in-law, wives, etc., into the engineering department, controlling the powers of financial revenue and expenditure, planning, engineering construction, and material procurement, and carried out large-scale theft activities. In 1951, most of the warehouse construction projects of the various professional companies in the Southwest, which were the responsibility of the engineering department, were contracted by this major embezzlement group. For example, the Chongqing Sugar Warehouse Project, the Bristle Warehouse Project, the Grain Warehouse Project, and a certain project in Beibei were all projects where Han Peisen, Xiang Junzhi, and Xu Qinshan stole the bid prices and engineering drawings and gave them to Huafeng, Hexingcheng, Ni Yuji, and other construction companies before the bidding. The capital used by the profiteers in the bidding was blank checks developed by Xu Mingzhang, the business director of the Siming Bank. After they used this fake trick to obtain the contract rights of the project, they distributed the project funds according to shares and used them for speculative business, only using a small amount of funds on the project to cope. For example, in the construction of the sugar factory project, Li Jiewen, the manager of Huafeng Construction Company, embezzled 145 million yuan before construction, Zhao Shuda, the manager of Hexingcheng Construction Company, embezzled 125 million yuan, Zhuang Maobin, the deputy manager of Ni Yuji Construction Company, embezzled 5 million yuan, and Lin Fo, the deputy manager of Dacheng Timber Company, embezzled 30 million yuan. The project has not yet been completed (more than three months beyond the contract period). During the construction of a certain project in Beibei, the first 100 million yuan of project funds allocated by the engineering department was not used for the project at all. The profiteers deposited the project funds in the China Industrial Bank to generate interest; of the second allocation of 195 million yuan, less than 100 million yuan was used on the project. Ni Yuji Construction Company contracted to build two grain warehouses and two bristle warehouses, and received more than 460 million yuan in advance payment. Zhong Dezhang, the manager of this factory (who has now been detained), embezzled all the funds after receiving the payment, resulting in a loss of more than 300 million yuan of public funds. The grain warehouse project started on March 30 last year, and after April 14, it stopped work waiting for materials. By the end of September, only the foundation was built; the bristle warehouse project only built the foundation. In addition, Zhong Dezhang also owed more than 8 million yuan to the porters at the Chaotianmen Wharf for carrying bricks and tiles.

The profiteers further wantonly cut corners in the project, fabricated fake drawings, and stole state property. One kind of engineering drawing was used for signing the contract, and another kind of drawing was used for construction. For example, the engineering drawing for the construction of a certain warehouse had roofing felt, but the construction drawing did not have roofing felt. This item alone defrauded the state of more than 16.5 million yuan. Liu Taichen, the deputy director of the engineering department, was high above and did not investigate and research when reviewing various projects. He simply stamped the documents according to regulations, which gave the embezzlers a convenient opportunity. The building materials purchased by the profiteers, such as wood, bricks, tiles, and cement, were all filled with inferior goods, which directly caused more serious losses to the project. The profiteers even directly stole state property or used the name of the engineering department to swindle and deceive outside. Once, Li Jiewen owed tax money, and Xu Qinshan stole 7 million yuan of public funds from the engineering department and gave it to Li Jiewen. Zhao Shuda borrowed 100 million yuan from the joint public-private Huagu Company in the name of the engineering department and has not yet repaid it.

After the profiteers stole state property, they enjoyed it to the fullest. Zhao Shuda, the manager of Hexingcheng, smoked more than 200,000 yuan of opium every day. Han Peisen, Xiang Junzhi, Li Jiewen, and Xu Qinshan often danced, and dancing once with a dancing girl cost 1 million yuan. Han Peisen lived in the "Red Palace Ballroom" in Chongqing, and when he went on business trips, he had women accompanying him on the boat. Wherever he went, there were women accompanying him, and people called him "Emperor Han."

After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, this group of profiteers and embezzlers tried to stubbornly resist, acted everywhere, established a "united front," and refused to confess. However, the masses have been mobilized and have exposed the crimes of the embezzlers. Some cadres painfully recounted the process of being deceived. Even Cai Tianyu, a singer who was introduced to the department by Han Peisen, boldly revealed Han's crimes. Under the pressure of the masses, Han Peisen confessed some embezzling facts, minimizing his crimes. Han Peisen and Xu Qinshan have now been arrested. Xiang Junzhi has been suspended from his duties for self-reflection and has been handed over to the masses for control, pending disposal. The People's Government has arrested Zhao Shuda, Zhuang Maobin, and Li Jiewen. The facts of embezzlement are being further investigated. (Originally published in Chongqing Xinhua Daily)

    韩培森和奸商里应外合的大贪污大盗窃案
    集良
    中央人民政府贸易部基本建设工程处西南分处在一九五零年十一月新雇用了一位施工员。这位施工员与一般工作人员有些不同，讲究阔绰、排场、挥金如土。他常常请同志们看电影、吃小食、跳舞，以示“大方”，对领导同志更是奉承备至。该处从上到下一直认为这位新施工员有“本领”，会办事，硬是“不错”，所以很快地把他从施工员提升为工程队长。这个施工员就是有计划地打入该处进行盗窃国家财产的蟊贼——韩培森。
    韩培森原是个营造厂商，一贯贪污。解放后把国民党那一套贪污、行贿、盗窃国家财产的伎俩原封未动地运用到新社会来。他来到工程处就认为这是个发财的最好的机会，千方百计地找到先前和他经营营造业的老搭挡李介文（华丰营造厂经理）、赵叔达（合兴成营造厂经理）、钟德璋（倪玉记营造厂经理）、庄茂彬（倪玉记营造厂副经理）、林佛
    （大成木材行副经理）等奸商组织了一个大贪污集团，准备对基本建设工程处进攻——大量盗窃国家财产。韩培森担任内线工作，他首先是以金钱、女色为“饵”，来拉拢、引诱与腐蚀工作人员。在这种阴谋鬼计下，一部分工作人员竟当了他的“俘虏”或帮凶。韩培森有了“基本群众”后，就进一步地施展毒劣阴谋，向领导干部进攻。老奸巨猾的韩培森一眼就看出了工程处的弱点：副处长刘泰琛是个高高在上的官僚主义者，大权完全掌握在“能说会道”的正工程师相钧之的手中。韩培森就开始对相钧之进行了猛烈的进攻。相钧之中了糖衣炮弹仍不自觉，还认为韩培森这个人“和颜悦色”，说话也很悦耳；因之，常在副处长刘泰琛面前夸奖韩培森。刘泰琛同志也认为韩培森真是建筑工程中罕有的“人才”，凡事是百依百从。韩培森看见他的初步计划成功了，就进行第二个步骤，把相钧之和工程处得力干部许钦山、李芳伯介绍给李介文、庄茂彬等。当奸商开始接触相钧之时，还不敢大胆妄为，先用请吃饭或看京剧的办法作为试探。李、庄都是商人中的巨奸坏蛋，专门引诱干部，他们看出了相钧之是个好色之徒，就拉相钧之跳舞，找舞女、歌女陪伴。但相钧之另一方面又要故作“清高”，他认为玩舞女只能在舞厅里玩，若把舞女带出来会朋友就会失掉“身份”。奸商知道了后，为着迎合相钧之，就把大成木材行副经理林佛的小老婆的妹妹柯忠秀从泸州叫到重庆来介绍给相钧之交“朋友”。在介绍柯忠秀和相钧之认识时，让柯忠秀佩带着某大学的校徽，诡称柯忠秀是某大学“高材生”。这样相钧之完全解除了武装。但是奸商们还不放心，他们怕柯忠秀一个人擒不住相钧之，于是倪玉记营造厂副经理庄茂彬让他妻子周慧英亲自出马，协助柯忠秀引诱相钧之。相钧之认为他们对自己太体贴了，也就不得不替奸商效劳，竟无耻地参加了奸商们组织的大贪污集团。其他工作人员如许钦山、李芳伯之流亦和相钧之同样遭到了奸商们的暗箭，当了俘虏或参加了这个贪污集团。
    奸商们的计划是阴险的，准备对工程处人员“一网打尽”。他们麻痹了工程处领导干部，收买了一般的得力干部后，就通过这种关系在工程处内部大力布置力量。用高价雇用了大批舞女、歌女、妓女打入内部，专门引诱腐化干部。例如把柯忠秀和另外两个舞女介绍到第一工程队当了领导工人政治学习的“辅导员”；“皇后歌厅”歌女李淑华当了三晋源工程队“辅导员”，“皇后歌厅”歌女蔡天玉当了九工程队“工作员”，甚至韩培森自己的老婆也派到工程处去“工作”。奸商引诱、腐蚀干部的手段极端毒辣。如北碚工地材料员袁仲开始对奸商盗窃国家财产的非法行为，加以阻止；奸商就雇用了一个女人专陪着袁仲玩，这样袁仲腐化堕落了，也变成了贪污分子。大批的干部就这样被奸商们布置的“美人计”腐化了。随后奸商们把自己的亲戚、内弟、老婆等都打入工程处内部，掌握着财政的收支、计划，工程的建筑、材料的购买等大权，进行大规模的窃盗活动。一九五一年工程处负责建设的西南各专业公司大部分仓库建筑工程，是由这个大贪污集团包修的。例如重庆糖仓工程、猪鬃仓库工程、粮食仓库工程、北碚某工程都是由韩培森、相钧之、许钦山在投标前把标底及工程图样偷盗给华丰、合兴成、倪玉记等营造厂。奸商们在投标时用的资本是由四明银行业务主任徐名章开发的空头支票。他们使用这种假圈套骗取了工程的承包权后，就把工程款按股分摊，用作投机倒把生意，只用少数款项在工程上应付。如建筑糖厂工程，施工前华丰营造厂经理李介文就贪污了一亿四千五百万元，合兴成营造厂经理赵叔达贪污了一亿二千五百万元，倪玉记营造厂副经理庄茂彬贪污了五百万元，大成木材行副经理林佛贪污了三千万元，工程到现在还没完成（超过合同规定时期三个多月）。建筑北碚某工程时，工程处第一次拨的一亿元工程款，根本没有用到工程上，奸商却把工程款存在中国实业银行生利；第二次拨的一亿九千五百万元，用在工程上的还不到一亿元。倪玉记营造厂承建粮食仓库两栋，猪鬃仓库两栋，共预领工程款四亿六千多万元，这个厂的经理钟德璋（现已扣押）领款后就把款项全部盗用，亏空公款三亿多元。粮仓工程去年三月三十日开工，到四月十四日以后就停工待料，到九月底仅砌好墙脚；猪鬃仓库工程只打好地基。此外钟德璋并拖欠朝天门码头搬运工人挑运砖瓦的力资八百多万元。
    奸商们在工程中更大肆偷工减料，制造假图样，盗窃国家财产。订合同使用一种工程图样，施工时用另一种图样。如建筑某仓库工程订合同的图样有油毛毡，但施工图样却没有油毛毡；仅这一项就骗取了国家财产一千六百五十多万元。工程处副处长刘泰琛高高在上，审查各项工程时不调查研究，只是照章盖印，这更给贪污分子一个便利机会。奸商们购买的建筑材料，如木材、砖、瓦、水泥，都以劣品充好货，直接造成工程上的损失更为严重。奸商们更直接盗取国家财产或借工程处名义在外面招摇撞骗。一次，李介文亏欠税款，许钦山就把工程处公款偷了七百万元给李介文，赵叔达并借着工程处名义向公私合营华固公司借了一亿元，至今仍拖延不还。
    奸商们盗窃了国家财产后，尽情享受挥霍。合兴成经理赵叔达每天吸食鸦片烟二十多万元，韩培森、相钧之、李介文、许钦山经常跳舞，和舞女跳
    一次舞就是一百万元。韩培森在重庆住“红宫舞厅”，出差时在船上有女人陪着；到那里，那里就有女人陪着，叫人称他是“韩皇帝”。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展后，这批奸商、贪污分子企图顽强对抗，到处活动，订立
    “攻守同盟”，拒不坦白。但是群众已发动起来，纷纷揭露贪污分子的罪恶。有的干部沉痛地述说受骗的经过，就是被韩培森介绍入该处的歌女蔡天玉也大胆地揭露了韩的罪恶。韩培森在群众压力下避重就轻地坦白了一些贪污事实。现已将韩培森、许钦山两人予以逮捕。令相钧之停职反省，并交群众管制，听候处理。人民政府已将赵叔达、庄茂彬、李介文予以逮捕，关于贪污事实现正进一步追查中。（原载重庆新华日报）
