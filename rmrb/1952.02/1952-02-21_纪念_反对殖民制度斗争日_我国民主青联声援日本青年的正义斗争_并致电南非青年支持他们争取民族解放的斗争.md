(Xinhua News Agency, 20th) To commemorate "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism," the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth sent a telegram to Japanese youth. The telegram reads:

Dear Japanese youth brothers and sisters:

On the occasion of February 21st, "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism," the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, on behalf of the Chinese youth advancing victoriously under the banner of Mao Zedong, extends fraternal greetings to the heroic Japanese youth!

Chinese youth deeply sympathize with the suffering of Japanese youth and the Japanese people under the rule of American imperialism and the Yoshida reactionary government. We warmly care for and support the various struggles of Japanese youth and the Japanese people against the American military occupation, against the traitorous policies of the Japanese reactionary clique, against the San Francisco Peace Treaty, against the U.S.-Japan Bilateral Security Treaty, against the Yoshida government's conclusion of a peace treaty with the reactionary remnants of the Chinese Kuomintang aimed at carrying out a war of aggression, striving for the independence of their motherland, and safeguarding world peace. Chinese youth eagerly hope that the Japanese people can obtain independence, democracy, peace, and progress.

We are closely watching your heroic struggles. We have seen that the Japanese youth movement, under the leadership of the heroic Japanese Communist Party, has made significant progress. We have seen that Japanese youth from all walks of life have united into an increasingly large force under the banner of the Youth Fatherland Front. We have seen that Japanese youth have become an important force in the Japanese people's struggle against the American military occupation, against the American rearmament of Japan, and against the American revival of Japanese militarism. We have also seen that Japanese youth, regardless of the cruel persecution by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, have actively participated in the six million signature movement to defend peace and have achieved a preliminary victory in the second trial of the "Matsukawa Incident." Your heroic struggles have become an important obstacle to the U.S. imperialist plot to turn Japan into an American colony and military base.

The friendship established between Chinese and Japanese youth in the common struggle against American imperialist aggression and for the maintenance of peace and security in the Far East and the world cannot be isolated or destroyed by any blockade or persecution. We are willing to support your struggle with practical actions to strengthen the resistance against America and aid Korea, and actively participate in the construction of New China.

We firmly believe that American imperialism and the Japanese reactionary clique are bound to suffer a shameful defeat, and the Japanese people are bound to win the final victory; because your struggle is just, and peace-loving people and all progressive people throughout the world are extremely sympathetic and supportive of you.

We wish you greater victories in the struggle against the American military occupation, for the independence, democracy, peace, and progress of Japan.

Long live the militant friendship between Chinese and Japanese youth!

All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, February 20th

(Xinhua News Agency, 20th) To commemorate "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism," the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth sent a telegram to South African youth. The telegram reads:

To the peace-loving, democratic, and free-loving youth friends of all nationalities in South Africa:

On the occasion of February 21st, "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism," we, on behalf of the Chinese youth, extend fraternal greetings to the youth of all nationalities in South Africa who are struggling against racial discrimination and national oppression! The youth of New China deeply sympathize with the suffering of all oppressed nationalities in South Africa under imperialist oppression. We fully support your just struggle. We wish the youth of all nationalities in South Africa to unite more closely and achieve new victories in the struggle for national liberation.

All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, February 18th

    我国民主青联声援日本青年的正义斗争
    并致电南非青年支持他们争取民族解放的斗争
    【新华社二十日讯】中华全国民主青年联合总会为纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”致电日本青年，电文如下：亲爱的日本青年兄弟姐妹们：
    值此二月二十一日“反对殖民制度斗争日”，中华全国民主青年联合总会谨代表在毛泽东旗帜下胜利前进着的中国青年，向英勇的日本青年致以兄弟般的敬礼！
    中国青年深切同情日本青年和日本人民在美帝国主义和吉田反动政府统治下所受的痛苦，热烈关怀与支持日本青年和日本人民反对美国军事占领、反对日本反动集团卖国政策、反对旧金山和约、反对美日双边安全条约、反对吉田政府与中国国民党反动残余集团缔结旨在进行侵略战争的和约、争取自己祖国独立、维护世界和平的各种斗争。中国青年热望日本人民能获得独立、民主、和平及进步。
    我们密切地注视着你们的这些英勇斗争。我们看到日本的青年运动在英勇的日本共产党领导下取得了长足的进展。我们看到各阶层的日本青年在青年祖国阵线的旗帜下已团结成为日益壮大的队伍。我们看到日本青年在日本人民反对美国军事占领、反对美国重新武装日本、反对美国复活日本军国主义的斗争中已成为一支重要的力量。我们也看到日本青年不顾美日反动派的残酷迫害而积极参加了保卫和平的六百万人签名运动，取得了“松川事件”第二审的初步胜利。你们的英勇斗争已成为美帝国主义把日本变为美国殖民地和军事基地的阴谋之重要障碍。
    中日两国青年在反对美帝国主义侵略、维护远东与世界的和平与安全的共同斗争中所建立的友谊，不是任何封锁迫害所能隔绝摧毁的。我们愿以加强抗美援朝、积极参加新中国建设的实际行动来支援你们的斗争。
    我们深信：美帝国主义和日本反动集团一定要遭到可耻的失败，日本人民一定要获得最后的胜利；因为你们的斗争是正义的，全世界爱好和平的人民和一切进步人士都是极热烈同情和支持你们的。
    敬祝你们在反对美国军事占领、争取日本独立、民主、和平及进步的斗争中获得更大的胜利。
    中日两国青年的战斗友谊万岁！
