Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 12th: At the Korean armistice negotiation meeting on the fifth agenda item on the 12th, our chief representative, General Nam Il, refuted the other side's proposals and their statement on the 11th point by point in detail. Our representative pointed out that the other side's proposal attempted to fundamentally eliminate the practical significance of making recommendations to the relevant governments of both sides with vague and empty wording. The other side claimed on the 11th that "the United Nations Command delegation is not deeply convinced that any recommendations from the commanders of both sides are necessary for a military armistice in Korea," and also stated that "it is possible that the United Nations Command delegation opposes making any recommendations," attempting to fundamentally cancel the fifth agenda item. Our representative sternly pointed out that the clear provisions of the agenda do not allow it to be overturned under any pretext. In order to achieve a reasonable resolution of the fifth agenda item quickly, our representative stated that they would submit an amendment at the next meeting of the delegations of both sides. The date and time for the reconvening of the meeting will be notified to the other side's liaison officer by our liaison officer.

At the staff meeting on the third agenda item, in order to quickly resolve the major differences between the two sides, our side proposed increasing the quota for rotation of military personnel to 30,000 per month, and increasing the number of rear ports to four for each side. Our side added Manpo as a specific rear port, and the other side added Yeosu as a specific port. Our staff pointed out that our side has made the efforts that our side should make. The resolution of the main points of disagreement between the two sides will depend on the efforts of the other side, and it is recommended that the other side give serious consideration to our proposal.

At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, our representative expressed his views on the working draft proposed by the other side one by one, and stated that the main task of the joint Red Cross groups formed by both sides after the armistice should be to assist the repatriation of prisoners of war at the prisoner of war handover points and during the handover process; before the prisoners of war on all sides are ready for repatriation, the groups may visit the prisoner of war camps to use the time, so they should respect and cooperate with the repatriation work of each side, the visiting time should be limited, and the repatriation of prisoners of war should not be delayed or the overall repatriation plan be affected due to the visit.

    南日将军揭露美方推翻议程企图
    第三项议程主要分歧的解决有待于美方的努力
    【新华社开城十二日电】十二日的朝鲜停战谈判第五项议程双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军逐点详尽地驳斥了对方的提案和对方十一日的发言。我方代表指出：对方的提案是企图以含糊空洞的措辞，来根本取消向双方有关各国政府建议的实际意义。对方在十一日声称：“联合国军代表团并不深信双方司令官的任何建议是朝鲜的军事停战所必需的”，又称：“可能联合国军代表团反对提出任何建议”，企图根本取消第五项议程。我方代表严词指出：议程的明确规定，不容许以任何藉口加以推翻。为使第五项议程迅速取得合理解决，我方代表声明将在下次双方代表团大会中提出修正案。大会重行召开的日期与时间将由我方联络官通知对方联络官。
    第三项议程参谋会议上我方为迅速解决双方主要分歧，提出将军事人员轮换限额提高为每月三万人，将后方口岸的数目增加为每方四个，我方增设满浦为后方特定口岸，对方增设丽水为特定口岸。我方参谋人员指出我方已作我方所应作的努力。双方主要分歧之点的解决将有待于对方的努力，建议对方对我方提案加以郑重的考虑。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，我方代表就对方所提的工作草案逐一表示了意见，并声明双方在停战后合组的联合红十字会小组的主要任务，应该是在战俘交接地点、在交接过程中、协助战俘的遣返；在各方战俘准备遣返就绪以前，利用时间，各小组得访问战俘营，因此当尊重并配合各方的遣俘工作，访问时间应有限制，不得因访问而延阻战俘的遣返或影响遣俘的总计划。
