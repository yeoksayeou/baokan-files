    Demand that the People's Government Severely Punish Traitorous Merchants Who Harmed the Volunteer Army
    Fu Huating, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce

    As the great struggle against corruption and bribery is surging throughout the country, unscrupulous merchants who harm the interests of the country and the people have been continuously discovered. In particular, some conscienceless and inhumanly vicious merchants have heartlessly poisoned their hands in national defense construction projects and in military supplies ordered for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, undermining military construction and seriously endangering the safety and health of the Volunteer Army, which is infuriating. Some of them cut corners and steal a large amount of state property in contracting national defense construction projects. Some of them even mixed large quantities of bad meat, rotten meat, and horse meat, pretending to be good beef and selling it to the Volunteer Army to make canned beef. Some of them defrauded the Volunteer Army of huge sums of money for purchasing medicines and deliberately delayed the delivery of medicines urgently needed at the front. For example, Li Yinting, a traitorous merchant of the Wuhan Fuhua Electrical and Medical Cotton Factory, replaced 10,000 jin of good cotton with waste cotton in the emergency kits and triangular bandages worth 6.6 billion yuan ordered by the people of the Central and Southern District to support the Volunteer Army. What is even more abhorrent is that he mixed in more than 1,000 jin of rotten cotton without sterilization, causing the wounds of the wounded to fester, and defrauded illegal profits of 1.8 billion yuan. These sinful acts are hateful and intolerable.
    Any Chinese person with a conscience regards participating in the vigorous movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea as their greatest glory. Everyone knows that only by defeating the aggression of U.S. imperialism can our country be built. All national defense construction projects and military supplies for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are militarily necessary and are necessary conditions for winning the war. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army, shouldering the will of the people of the motherland, has been fighting abroad since going abroad, living a hard life, and sacrificing heroically, guaranteeing the safety of the motherland and giving us a peaceful and happy life. When drinking water, think of its source. How should we love the most beloved and heroic children of our motherland to be worthy of our conscience? However, these heartless and vicious merchants are ungrateful. In national defense projects and in the medical supplies and food urgently needed by the Volunteer Army supplied by the people of the whole country, and in the materials needed by the veterans, they sought exorbitant profits, cut corners, and cruelly endangered the safety and health of the beloved Volunteer Army, causing many wounded soldiers to become disabled who should not have been, and sacrificing those who should not have been sacrificed. These traitorous merchants' heinous actions are simply accomplices of U.S. imperialism and criminals who directly undermine the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea. We should punish them without mercy, otherwise we will not be able to repay the glorious achievements of the People's Volunteer Army on the front line of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea.
    We, all industrialists and businessmen, unanimously demand that the government, according to the severity of the crime and the degree of malice, severely punish these traitorous merchants who endanger national defense construction and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army according to the law, and not deal with them as ordinary cases. Those with cruel natures should be punished with the death penalty without pardon, and these traitors should be purged to purify our internal affairs. Everyone should clearly realize that they are no longer industrialists and businessmen, but thoroughgoing national traitors who harm others and benefit themselves. In the world of the people, their existence cannot be allowed. All traitorous merchants with illegal acts should quickly confess their crimes to the government.

    要求人民政府严惩暗害志愿军的奸商
    北京市工商业联合会主任委员　傅华亭
    反贪污、反行贿的伟大斗争，正在全国汹涌开展之际，连续发现不法奸商，危害国家和人民的利益，特别是有些丧尽天良灭绝人性的恶毒奸商，竟在国防建设工程和在中国人民志愿军订购的军需品中，忍心下毒手，破坏军事建设和严重地危害志愿军安全和健康，令人痛恨发指。他们有的在承包国防建设工程中，偷工减料，盗窃国家大量资财。他们有的竟以大批坏肉、臭肉和马肉，混充好牛肉卖给志愿军制造罐头牛肉。他们有的骗取志愿军购药巨款，故意延迟不交付前线急需的药品。像汉口福华电机药棉厂奸商李寅廷之流，在中南区人民支援志愿军所定制价值六十六亿元的救急包和三角巾定货中，以废棉花盗换领来的好棉花一万斤，更可恶的掺入一千多斤的烂棉，不经消毒，以致使得伤员伤口化脓，盗骗非法利润十八亿元。这些罪恶的行为，都是令人痛恨而不能容忍的事件。
    任何一个有天良的我国人民，都以参加轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动作为自己莫大的光荣。大家知道，只有打垮美帝国主义的侵略，我们国家才能建设。一切国防建设工程和供应中国人民志愿军的军需品，都是军事上所必需，而且是争取战争胜利的必要条件。中国人民志愿军更肩负着祖国人民的意志，出国作战以来，过着艰苦的生活，英勇牺牲，保证了祖国的安全，使我们有和平和幸福的生活。饮水思源，我们应该如何热爱祖国最可爱最英勇的儿女，才对得起自己的良心。但是，这些毫无心肝的恶毒奸商们，忘恩负义，在国防工程和全国人民供应志愿军迫切需要的医疗品和食品中，荣誉军人所需物资中，他们竟贪图暴利，偷工减料，并残忍地危害可爱的志愿军的安全和健康，使很多伤员不该残废的残废了，不该牺牲的牺牲了。这些奸商伤天害理的行为，简直是美帝国主义的帮凶，是直接破坏抗美援朝力量的罪犯。我们应该毫不容情地惩罚他们，否则就无法报偿我们抗美援朝前线的人民志愿军光辉的战绩。
    我们全体工商业者，对于这些危害国防建设和中国人民志愿军的奸商，一致要求政府根据罪行的大小，恶毒程度的轻重，予以依法重惩，不能与普通案件一般处理。性质残忍的，更应罪不容赦的处以极刑，把这些叛徒们清洗出去，来纯洁我们的内部。大家应该清楚认识到，他们已经不是工商业者，是一个彻头彻尾损人利己的民族叛徒，在人民的天下，是不能允许他们存在的。一切有非法行为的奸商，应迅速向政府坦白认罪。
