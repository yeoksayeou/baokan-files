Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 12th: Our correspondent reports: The Chinese People's Volunteer Army is deeply engaged in an economy drive, implementing the spirit of cherishing national resources into combat and daily life. At the front lines, commanders and soldiers, in order to achieve the greatest victory with the least cost, are more carefully studying the situation and precisely arranging combat before each battle. Many soldiers not only try to save ammunition in combat, but also do not easily discard bullet casings and shell casings. Tao Wanli, a soldier in a machine gun company of a certain unit, collected more than 2,700 bullet casings on the position in a few days. The soldiers of a certain artillery unit also collected all the shell casings and handed them over to the public. They also made a plan to ensure that they hand in as many shell casings as they fire shells. In the midst of intense fighting, the soldiers' clothes are easily damaged, so they seize the gaps in the battle to mend their torn clothes. Since the launch of the economy drive, the Eighth Company of a certain unit has mended eighty-four pairs of worn-out shoes and one hundred and ten pieces of torn clothing in a short period of time. Many people try to mend and wear clothes that they no longer intend to wear. They also plan to save a set of shirts, a towel, and a pair of shoes per person this year.

The soldiers said: "Economy should start from small things. If one person saves a little, the entire Volunteer Army can save a lot." Under the slogan of "not wasting a single grain of rice," the cooking班 of the Second Company of a certain unit carefully scraped off the dough stuck to the flour bags due to rain and snow with a knife, scraping off more than sixty pounds of flour in more than a month. When an engineering battalion was building a bridge, they accidentally dropped a few two-pronged nails into the river. Regardless of the cold weather, the soldiers rolled up their trousers and went into the icy river to feel around for them. Soldier Wu Zhiming also fished out sixty rusty and broken two-pronged nails from the bottom of the river and handed them over to the battalion headquarters. This spirit of economy, which does not let go of every little thing, has been praised by the leadership of the battalion.

The soldiers of an ironwork team of a certain unit used various discarded materials to repair guns. In six days, they collected 4,000 kilograms of scrap steel and iron and 3,000 kilograms of coal slag, and used these raw materials and fuel to repair 168 guns, manufacture more than 180 tools, 20,000 horseshoes nails, 7,500 seven-inch slip nails, and 210 picks in thirty-five days, and created 10,000 sets of winter anti-skid equipment for vehicles. All finished products are worth about 120 million RMB. The staff of a certain field hospital used aluminum sheets from destroyed enemy planes to make utensils for patients, also saving the motherland about 3 million RMB.

The truck drivers on the transportation lines proposed to cherish every part and save every drop of gasoline. Many units have overfulfilled their tasks. Du Yezhong, a driver of a certain automobile unit, drove 1,180 kilometers more than required in ten days, transporting more than 33,200 kilograms of grain to the front line, and saving 81 gallons of gasoline. Sun Daxin and Yan Ren, two truck drivers from another unit, have consistently paid attention to economy, saving a total of more than 1,200 gallons of gasoline in half a year.

    人民志愿军深入展开节约运动
    将爱护祖国物资的精神贯彻到战斗中去
    【新华社朝鲜前线十二日电】本社记者报道：中国人民志愿军正深入展开节约运动，将爱护祖国物资的精神贯彻到战斗和日常生活中去。在最前线的指挥员和战斗员们，为了能用最少的代价取得最大的胜利，他们在每次战斗之前，更加仔细地研究情况和精密地布置战斗。许多战士不但在战斗中尽量节省弹药，而且连子弹壳和炮弹壳也不轻易丢弃。某部机枪连战士陶万里在几天内便在阵地上搜集了二千七百多个子弹壳。某炮兵部队的战士也将所有的炮弹壳都收拾起来缴公。他们并且订了一个计划，保证打多少发炮弹便缴多少个炮弹壳。在紧张的战斗中，战士们的衣服极易破损，他们便抓紧战斗空隙把破衣服缝补起来。某部八连自节约运动展开以后，在短时间内就缝补了八十四双破旧鞋子和一百一十件破衣服。许多人把已经不准备再穿的衣服设法缝补好再穿。他们并计划今年每人要节约一套衬衣、一条毛巾和一双鞋子。
    战士们说：“节约要从小处做起，一个人节约一点，整个志愿军就能节约许多。”某部二连炊事班在
    “不浪费一粒米”的口号下，将因雨雪打湿而黏在面袋上的面块用刀细心地刮下来，一个多月便刮下了六十多斤面粉。某工兵营在架桥时不慎将几只二爪钉掉到河里，战士们不顾天寒水冷，卷起裤子到冰冷的河水中去摸起来。战士吴志明并把河底里已经锈了的和坏了的六十多只二爪钉都摸出来缴到营指挥所。这种不放松每一件小事的节约精神，曾经受到该营领导方面的表扬。
    某部一个铁工队的战士们利用各种废弃材料修理枪械。他们在六天内搜集了四千斤废钢碎铁和三千斤煤渣，并用这些原料和燃料在三十五天内修好了一百六十八枝枪，制造了一百八十多件工具、两万个马掌钉、七千五百个七寸滑钉和二百一十把洋镐，并创造了车辆用的冬季防滑用具一万件，全部成品约值人民币一亿二千万元。某战地医院的工作人员利用被击毁的敌机上的铝片做病人的用具，也为祖国节约了约人民币三百多万元。
    运输线上的汽车驾驶员们提出了要做到爱护每一件零件和节约每一滴汽油。不少部队超额完成了任务。某汽车部队司机杜业忠在十天中超额行车一千一百八十公里，给前线部队多运了三万三千二百多斤粮食，并节约了八十一加仑汽油。另部汽车司机孙大鑫和阎仁二人一贯注意节约，在半年内节约的汽油总计在一千二百加仑以上。
