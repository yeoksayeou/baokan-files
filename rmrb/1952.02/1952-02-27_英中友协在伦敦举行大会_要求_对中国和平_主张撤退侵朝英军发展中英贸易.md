Xinhua News Agency, London, February 25th: According to TASS, the Sino-British Friendship Association held a "Peace with China" congress in Beaver Hall, London, on the 23rd. Participating in the congress were more than 130 representatives from British working-class organizations and progressive groups, representing 200,000 members, and 120 guests.

Labour Party Member of Parliament, Mr. Benn, delivered the opening speech, emphasizing the necessity of establishing friendly relations with the People's Republic of China.

Mr. Dickinson, General Secretary of the Burnley Weavers' Association in Lancashire, stated at the meeting that the members of the Burnley Weavers' Association earnestly hoped to develop trade between Britain and China in order to eliminate unemployment in the Lancashire cotton textile industry. Dickinson said that the act of rearming Japan under the one-sided treaty posed a serious threat to peace in the Far East. Only the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact could guarantee that the money currently spent on armaments would be diverted to peaceful construction projects. He added, "Friendship between Britain and China can strengthen the forces of peace throughout the world."

The congress then proceeded with discussions, and the representatives participating in the discussions all emphasized the need to live in peace with China and conduct trade. They repeatedly pointed out that trade with China could help Britain overcome its economic crisis and prevent unemployment in the coming years.

The congress unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the British government take all possible steps to ensure the swift and satisfactory conclusion of the Korean armistice negotiations; resolutely and promptly take unilateral action to withdraw British troops from Korea; declare its disagreement with the US-implemented plan to wage war against China, and demand the immediate return of Taiwan to the People's Republic of China; withdraw support for the so-called "Japanese Peace Treaty" and the rearming of Japan; fully and sincerely support China's legitimate demand to attend United Nations organizations; participate in broad negotiations to seek lasting world peace; and negotiate with China to conclude a broad trade agreement.

The congress also unanimously passed a declaration of friendship from the citizens of London to the citizens of Beijing.
