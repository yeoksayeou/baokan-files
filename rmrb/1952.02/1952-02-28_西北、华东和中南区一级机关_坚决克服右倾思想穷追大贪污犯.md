(Xinhua News Agency) The anti-corruption struggle in the first-level organs of the Northwest, East China, and Central South major administrative regions has victoriously concluded the first campaign, based on resolutely overcoming right-leaning ideology. Currently, a fierce siege of major embezzlers is continuing. Before the start of the first campaign in the Northwest region's first-level organs (February 1st to 10th), many leading cadres of the organs were satisfied with the number of minor and medium embezzlement cases exposed and did not adequately recognize the harm of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks over the past three years. Therefore, they believed that there were no major problems in their own organs and prepared to shift the focus of the movement to examining bureaucracy. The Northwest Region's Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee severely criticized this right-leaning ideology and immediately took emergency measures: requiring each organ to submit a preliminary plan, with the head of the organ responsible for implementing "contracting, attacking, and winning." When formulating the plan, many organs discovered the nests of embezzlers, thereby strengthening their sense of enemy situation and increasing their confidence in investigating embezzlers. Bureaucrats were also shocked by the facts and felt that they should thoroughly reform and atone for their sins. Later, among the embezzlers captured, all proved the serious facts of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks over the past three years. For example, among the ten major embezzlers captured by the Xi'an Branch of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, nine were bourgeois elements who had infiltrated or "undercover agents" sent by the bourgeoisie. The right-leaning ideology of many responsible cadres was gradually shattered in the face of the heinous attack facts of the bourgeoisie, and these facts also educated the cadres and the broad masses. As of the 10th, the number of embezzlers captured by the first-level organs in the Northwest region exceeded the original plan, and the first campaign was victoriously concluded. At the beginning of the second campaign, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, pointed out: This campaign is more arduous than the first. The embezzlers are more cunning and hidden. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to criticize right-leaning ideology, strengthen investigation and research, do a good job in ideological and political work, and continue to fight to completely smash all the large and small fortresses of illegal capitalists placed within us!

Since the first-level organs in East China began to concentrate their firepower to encircle and suppress major embezzlers on February 9th, most organs, under the personal leadership of the main responsible cadres, brought into play the strength of the masses and universally implemented special teams to investigate major embezzlers. By the 16th, the first campaign had been victoriously completed. The most important reason for the victory of the first campaign was that, in the course of the campaign, the right-leaning ideology in the leadership of some units was promptly criticized and corrected. The specific manifestations of this right-leaning ideology were: turning a blind eye to the serious embezzlement phenomena in their own units; failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves in dealing with major embezzlers; underestimating the cunning of embezzlers, especially major embezzlers; and failing to create conditions themselves, waiting for major embezzlers to surrender automatically. This right-leaning ideology is currently expressed in two other forms: one is complacency with slight achievements, arrogance, and underestimation of the enemy, and a beginning to relax one's fighting spirit. The other is commandism, that is, only talking about tasks and not about policies; only talking about numbers and not about methods; not using one's brain and blindly rushing forward; to the point of being divorced from the masses and violating policies. This right-leaning ideology objectively played a role in sheltering major embezzlers. Therefore, when determining the plan for the second campaign, the East China Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee called on all units to strengthen investigation and research; strengthen the organization of various firepowers; and strengthen political work in order to achieve greater victory in the second campaign.

Before launching the campaign to encircle and suppress embezzlers, the directly subordinate organs of the Central China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central South Military and Political Committee had a rather serious right-leaning ideology, which was prominently manifested in the insufficient estimation of the situation of embezzlers and a lack of clear understanding. Therefore, the plans were generally set very low. On February 7th, the Central China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of senior cadres, which conducted a serious criticism of right-leaning ideology through the method of detailed accounting, using indisputable facts, thereby launching a mass movement. All organs conducted meticulous investigation and research work in an organized and planned manner, making it impossible for embezzlers to hide in the face of ironclad evidence. Many organs used cadres with clean hands as the backbone, special cases were handled by special personnel, and contracting and attacking were carried out, with good results.

Currently, all organs are summing up the experience of the previous stage and adjusting their teams, preparing to attack major embezzlers. Since all major embezzlers are directly related to the bourgeoisie, they are either traitors or undercover agents. The Wuhan Municipal Anti-Corruption Joint Inspection Committee is specifically organizing the victorious meeting of the two armies of anti-corruption and anti-bribery.

### 西北、华东和中南区一级机关  坚决克服右倾思想穷追大贪污犯

    西北、华东和中南区一级机关
    坚决克服右倾思想穷追大贪污犯
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：西北、华东、中南三个大行政区一级机关的反贪污斗争，在坚决克服右倾思想的基础上，已分别胜利结束第一个战役。目前正继续猛烈围攻大贪污犯。西北区一级机关第一个战役（二月一日至十日）开始前，很多机关的领导干部满足于被揭发出来的中小贪污案件的数字，对资产阶级三年来猖狂进攻的危害性认识不足，因此认为本机关问题不大，准备把运动的锋芒转到检查官僚主义上去。西北区一级机关增产节约委员会严厉地批判了这种右倾思想，并立即采取了紧急措施：要求各机关提出初步的计划，首长负责实行“包干、包打、包胜”。在制订计划时，很多机关发现了贪污犯的巢穴，从而加强了敌情观念，提高了清查贪污犯的信心，官僚主义者也在事实面前猛吃一惊，感到应痛改前非，立功赎罪。后来，在所擒获的贪污犯中，无一不证明资产阶级三年来猖狂进攻的严重事实。例如郑州铁路管理局西安分局捕获的十个大贪污犯中，就有九个是混进来的资产阶级分子或是资产阶级派进来的“坐探”。很多负责干部的右倾思想，在资产阶级穷凶极恶的进攻事实面前逐渐地被粉碎了，这些事实也同时教育了干部和广大的群众。截至十日止，西北区一级机关捕获的贪污犯超出了原计划，胜利地结束了第一个战役。第二个战役开始时，西北军政委员会副主席习仲勋指出：这次战役比第一次更艰巨，贪污犯是更加狡猾和隐蔽了，因此，必须在继续批判右倾思想的基础上，加强调查研究，做好思想政治工作，再接再厉地为彻底粉碎不法资本家安在我们内部的一切大小堡垒而斗争！
    华东区一级机关从二月九日开始集中火力围剿大贪污分子以来，大部分机关在主要负责干部亲自领导下，发挥群众力量，普遍实行专案专组追查大贪污分子。到十六日为止，已胜利完成第一个战役。第一个战役所以获得胜利，最重要的原因是在战役过程中，及时地批判和纠正了某些单位领导方面的右倾思想。这种右倾思想的具体表现是：对本单位的严重贪污现象熟视无睹；在对待大贪污分子的态度上敌我不分；对贪污犯特别是大贪污犯的狡猾估计不足；自己不去创造条件，坐待大贪污犯来自动投案。这种右倾思想在目前还表现为另外两种形式：一种是稍有成绩便沾沾自喜，骄傲轻敌，开始松懈斗志。另一种是命令主义，即是只讲任务，不讲政策；只讲数字，不讲办法；不动脑筋，盲目蛮干；以至脱离群众，违反政策。这种右倾思想，客观上起了包庇大贪污犯的作用，因此华东增产节约委员会在确定第二个战役的计划时，号召各单位加强调查研究；加强各种火力的组织；加强政治工作，以取得第二个战役的更大胜利。
    中共中央中南局、中南军政委员会直属机关在发动围剿贪污分子的战役以前，右倾思想相当严重，突出地表现在对贪污分子的情况估计不足，心中无数，因此计划一般都订得很低。二月七日中共中央中南局召开高级干部会议，通过算细账的办法，以无可争辩的事实对右倾思想进行了严肃的批判，从而展开了群众性的运动。各机关都有组织有计划地进行了细致的调查研究工作，使贪污分子在铁的证据前面无可躲藏。许多机关以手面干净的干部为骨干，专案专人，包查包打，效果良好。
    目前各机关正在总结前一阶段经验，并调整队伍，准备向大贪污分子进攻。由于所有的大贪污分子都和资产阶级直接有关，他们不是叛徒就是坐探，武汉市反贪污联合检查委员会正在具体组织反贪污和反行贿两路大军的胜利会师。
