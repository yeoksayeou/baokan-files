Read-the-Newspaper Group Activities

    The Read-the-Newspaper Propaganda Work of the Beijing Train Section

    Most of the staff of the Beijing Train Section are engaged in long-distance passenger service on the Beijing-Shenyang, Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Changchun, and Beijing-Baotou lines. We need four or five days for one trip, and at most five or six days a month are spent in the office. Based on this practical situation, we have established 28 read-the-newspaper groups among the 26 contract-carriage groups and internal staff (and established read-the-newspaper handover stations on various lines, so that crew members in remote areas can see the People's Daily in a timely manner), as the core organization for our regular study and propaganda work to passengers.

    During the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, our read-the-newspaper groups became even more active. First, the read-the-newspaper groups educated all crew members to thoroughly confess their problems. Many train crew members were engaged in smuggling and drug trafficking in the old society. After liberation, some employees continued to engage in these illegal activities. At the beginning of this movement, after the leaders' mobilization reports and through reading the newspaper, many people realized their sins and confessed to the organization the facts of their dealing in gold and silver and smuggling opium. Jia Heming, the apartment manager, handed over a house he bought with the profits from smuggling drugs. Because of his thorough confession, the government announced that he was exempt from legal and administrative sanctions. Train attendant Liu Hanzhong not only confessed his past illegal activities of drug trafficking, but also reported a large drug trafficking merchant. Train attendant Yang Yongyin earned a gold ingot when he used to traffic drugs. After the movement started, he wanted to hand it over to the organization, but he was reluctant and afraid that if he handed over the gold ingot, the higher authorities would continue to investigate, so he did not hand it over for a while. These erroneous thoughts made him uneasy. One day, he was copying materials from the newspaper, preparing to carry out propaganda to passengers, one sentence of which was "Corrupt elements should return the ill-gotten gains to the state..." He couldn't copy any further. He finally made up his mind to hand over the gold ingot. He said: "I don't want this dirty thing anymore." After reading the report by Comrade Bo Yibo at the Beijing public trial of major corrupt elements, published in the People's Daily on February 2nd, the first read-the-newspaper group on the Beijing-Shenyang line held a heated discussion. Passenger car captain Zhao Guisheng and other crew members confessed to the smuggling problems that they had not confessed thoroughly.

    Conducting propaganda to all passengers is a part of our read-the-newspaper group's activities. We determine the content of the propaganda according to the situation of the passengers on each line (for example, the passengers on the Beijing-Changchun and Beijing-Baotou lines are mostly farmers and small merchants, so we focus on publicizing the principles of anti-corruption and anti-waste; the passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Shenyang lines are mostly military and government cadres and large merchants, so we focus on publicizing the government's handling of corrupt elements and tax-evading profiteers). We use forms such as broadcasting, carriage explanations, and storytelling with clapper boards to carry out propaganda. On January 16, on the 106th Beijing-Changchun passenger train, after the train attendants carried out propaganda for the anti-corruption movement, a passenger immediately found the car captain and reported an incident of another passenger carrying the prohibited item of sulfur. We immediately broadcast this news to all passengers, which was met with warm applause. According to our survey, after such propaganda, the reactions can be roughly divided into the following categories: Workers and peasants all hate corrupt elements and big profiteers with gnashing teeth. They said, "The fruits of our hard work and sweat are swallowed by these guys in one bite. How can we not be heartbroken?" Some people also said, "Chairman Mao is so wise, if these corrupt elements and big profiteers are not suppressed, increasing production and practicing economy will be just empty talk!" The masses were very indignant, and some even took the lead in shouting slogans. But those who had a guilty conscience sat there dejectedly, very depressed.

    北京列车段的读报宣传工作
    北京列车段大多数职工，担任京沈、京沪、京长、京包等线的长途乘务工作。我们跑一次车，需要四、五天时间，每月顶多有五、六天留在机关内。根据这种实际情况，我们在全段二十六个包乘组及内勤职工中，建立了二十八个读报小组（并在各条线路上建立读报交接站，使在远地的乘务员能及时地看到人民日报），作为我们经常进行学习和向旅客进行宣传工作的核心组织。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我们的读报小组更活跃了起来。首先，读报组教育全体乘务人员，彻底交代自己的问题。许多列车乘务人员在旧社会里走私和贩运毒品。解放后，某些职工还继续干着这种非法的勾当。这次运动开始时，经过首长的动员报告，通过读报学习，不少人都认识到自己的罪恶，向组织上坦白了自己捣卖金银和私运烟土的事实。公寓管理员贾鹤鸣交出了自己因偷运毒品获利而买下的一所房屋。由于他坦白彻底，政府宣布免予法律和行政处分。列车员刘汉忠不但坦白了自己过去贩运毒品的非法行为，还检举了一个贩制毒品的大奸商。列车员杨永印在过去贩运毒品时，赚了一个金锭。运动开始后，他想交给组织，但心里舍不得，又恐怕交出金锭，上级继续追查，因此一时没有交出。这些错误思想，使他坐立不安。有一天，他抄写报纸上的材料，准备向旅客进行宣传，其中有一句是“贪污分子所得赃款应该交还国家……”抄到这里，他再也抄不下去了。他终于下了决心，把这锭金子交出来。他说：“这脏东西我再也不要了。”京沈线第一读报组在读完二月二日人民日报刊登的薄一波同志在北京市公审大贪污犯大会上的报告后，进行了热烈的讨论。客运车长赵贵生和其他的乘务人员都坦白了自己没有交代彻底的走私问题。
    向全车旅客进行宣传工作，是我们读报组活动的一部分。我们根据各线乘客的情况，确定宣传内容
    （如京长、京包两线的乘客多是农民和小商人，我们就着重宣传反贪污反浪费的道理；京沪、京沈线的乘客多是军政干部和大商人，我们就着重宣传政府对贪污分子和偷税行贿的奸商的处理办法）。运用广播、车厢讲解、说快板等形式，进行宣传。一月十六日，在一○六次京长客车上，列车员进行了反贪污运动的宣传后，立即有一位旅客找车长检举了另一位乘客携带硫磺禁运品的事件。我们立刻向全车旅客广播了这个消息，获得了热烈的掌声。根据我们的调查像这样宣传后，得到的反应，大体可分下列几种：工人、农民们都咬牙切齿地痛恨贪污分子和大奸商。他们说：“我们辛辛苦苦流血、流汗得来的果实，被这些家伙一口吞了，我们能不痛心？”也有人说：“毛主席真英明，要不把这些贪污分子和大奸商压下去，增产节约就会是一句空话！”群众的情绪很愤慨，有的甚至带头喊口号。但是那些心里有鬼的人则垂头丧气地坐在那里，十分消沉。
