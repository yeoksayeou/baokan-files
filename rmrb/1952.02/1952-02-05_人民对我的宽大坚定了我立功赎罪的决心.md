    Editor's Note: Hang Xiaozu was one of the major embezzlers tried at the Beijing public trial of major embezzlers on February 1st. He was exempted from criminal punishment for his voluntary and thorough confession and meritorious service. The following are his thoughts after being released.

    At the Beijing public trial of major embezzlers on February 1st, I was one of the seven major embezzlers being tried. I was escorted into the venue by the people's police, standing timidly before the angry masses, awaiting the final verdict of the Supreme People's Court's provisional tribunal. When I heard the presiding judge announce the death sentences for major embezzlers Xue Kunshan and Song Degui, who refused to confess, a feeling of dread made my whole body tremble. I thought my crimes of embezzlement were too serious, and even though I had voluntarily made a thorough confession, it would be difficult for the people to forgive me. But to my surprise, the people gave me the most lenient treatment, and the provisional tribunal of the Supreme People's Court sentenced me to exemption from criminal punishment. When my colleagues from the organization brought me back into the crowd, gratitude, shame, regret, the desire to correct my mistakes, and other complex emotions intertwined in my heart, and I had many things I wanted to say.

    I am the chief engineer and factory director of the Civil Aviation Administration's Telecommunications Factory, and I previously served as the chief telecommunications engineer at the pseudo-China National Aviation Corporation. I considered myself a senior technician who had studied in Germany and always touted myself as "not being involved in politics," relying on the belief that "with my skills, everyone will have to beg me." In 1949, when the pseudo-China National Aviation Corporation revolted in Hong Kong, I secretly embezzled 17,500 Hong Kong dollars in employee salaries (equivalent to over 110 million RMB at the time) and a wire recorder. My thinking at the time was that if the revolt failed, I would have money on hand to live in Hong Kong for a while; even if the revolt succeeded, my treatment after returning to China would inevitably be low, and this money could be used as a supplement to my living expenses. Driven by this selfish, opportunistic thinking, I committed extremely serious acts of embezzlement.

    During the rectification movement in early 1951, with the help of superiors and the masses, I made a preliminary confession of my embezzlement and handed over the wire recorder. However, I was still unable to fundamentally explore the roots of my mistakes, my pure technical viewpoint had not been thoroughly resolved, and the extravagant and wasteful thoughts and behaviors that led me to embezzlement had not been overcome. I once spent four million RMB on a business trip to Shanghai. Over the past year, although I have achieved some small successes in my work, this is far from making up for my crimes of embezzlement.

    The great anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement saved me, making me deeply aware of the seriousness of my mistakes. The reason why I degenerated into a thief who stole the people's property is inseparable from my selfish, wasteful, pleasure-seeking, and decadent bourgeois ideology; but more seriously, it was my pure technical viewpoint. It was precisely under the control of this thinking that I wavered during the revolt, my position was unstable, and I developed extremely despicable opportunistic thoughts. After returning to China, I consistently despised political study and one-sidedly emphasized the importance of technology. It was not until this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement unfolded that I suddenly woke up and realized that a pure technical viewpoint would not work. Without political leadership, technology has no future, especially for a profit-seeking embezzler like me, who is not difficult for the enemy to buy off. After recognizing the danger of this thinking, I was for the first time aroused my determination to thoroughly reform my ideology. Therefore, I painfully criticized my embezzlement crimes ideologically, and after a period of intense ideological struggle, I voluntarily made a thorough and painful confession to the organization and the masses.

    After the confession, I quietly awaited the organization's handling. I thought that in such a fierce anti-corruption struggle, as a major embezzler with such serious crimes, even if I had made a thorough confession, I would certainly not be completely exempted from the people's punishment. In the middle of the Spring Festival, I received a telegram from the bureau chief, ordering me to leave Tianjin immediately and go to Beijing. I had a premonition that the punishment I deserved was coming.

    But at the public trial, I received the most lenient treatment from the people. When I returned to the crowd bathed in sunshine, my eyes were filled with tears, and I became a human being again. I deeply realized how lenient the People's Government is towards an embezzler who voluntarily makes a thorough confession. I recalled how the People's Government had repeatedly called for strict punishment of embezzlers who refused to confess and for reduced or even exempted criminal punishment for embezzlers who voluntarily made a thorough confession and could atone for their crimes with meritorious service. This policy of the government was clearly reflected in this conference. The People's Government has constantly called on embezzlers to confess, repeatedly giving them opportunities to reflect. Director Bo Yibo even extended the confession deadline for embezzlers to the 15th of this month at the meeting. It can be said that the People's Government has done its utmost to enlighten embezzlers to confess. All embezzlers, especially major embezzlers, should choose the path they should take from my example; if they do not repent, they will only end up like Xue Kunshan and Song Degui.

    This conference profoundly educated me, making me further realize the brilliance and greatness of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. I saw that whether they are Party members or non-Party members, whether they are senior cadres or lower-level cadres, whether they have made contributions in the past or not, as long as they are thieves who steal state property, their treatment is only one kind: those who voluntarily make a thorough confession will be given a reduced or exempted sentence, and those who refuse to confess will be given a heavier punishment, even execution, and there are no exceptions. From this, I deeply feel the Communist Party's selflessness and uprightness, which fully demonstrates that the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are sure to be able to defeat the bourgeoisie's attack and are sure to be able to quickly move towards a happy and fulfilling socialist society.

    The people's lenient treatment of me has further strengthened my determination to expiate my crimes through meritorious service. In addition to guaranteeing that I will never commit acts of embezzlement again in the future and that I will return all the embezzled money to the state, I also request that the Civil Aviation Administration give me the punishment I deserve. In the future, I am determined to respond to Chairman Mao's call and thoroughly reform my old ideology. With the arrival of the high tide of national economic construction, the ideological transformation of technical personnel is even more urgent. I am willing to do my utmost to overcome the pure technical viewpoint that does not distinguish between enemies and friends, and resolutely fight back against the ugly thoughts and behaviors of the bourgeoisie, and I am determined to contribute all my technology and ability to the great construction cause of the motherland.

    Finally, I hope that all embezzlers who are still hesitating and wandering will wake up quickly and choose the path they should take between exemption, imprisonment, and death. The direction has already been pointed out, and time is running out. Which path you take is entirely up to you!

    人民对我的宽大坚定了我立功赎罪的决心
    杭效祖
    编者按：杭效祖是二月一日北京公审大贪污犯大会上被审判的大贪污犯之一。他因为自动彻底坦白并立功赎罪而被免予刑事处分。下面是他被释放后所写的感想。
    二月一日北京公审大贪污犯大会上，我是被审的七个大贪污犯中间的一个。我被人民警察押进会场，腼腆地站在愤怒的群众面前，等待最高人民法院临时法庭对我作最后的判决。当我听到审判长宣布判处拒不坦白的大贪污犯薛昆山、宋德贵死刑的时候，恐惧的心情使我全身战栗。我想我的贪污罪恶太深重了，虽然我已经自动作了彻底的坦白，也是难以被人民原谅的。可是出乎我意料的是，人民却给予我最宽大的待遇，最高人民法院临时法庭判决我免予刑事处分。当我被机关内的同事带回到群众队伍中间的时候，感激，惭愧，悔恨，痛改前非等等复杂的情绪交织在我的心中，我有很多话想说。
    我是民航局电讯厂总工程师兼厂长，过去在伪中央航空公司担任电讯总工程师。我自以为是留学德国的高级技术人员，一向标榜“不问政治”，自恃
    “有技术，谁都要央求我”。一九四九年伪中央航空公司在香港起义时，我暗中吞食职工薪金一万七千五百元港币（当时折合人民币共为一亿一千多万元）及钢丝录音机一架。我当时的想法是，如果起义失败，那么我手头有一笔钱也可以在香港过些日子；即使起义成功，那么回国以后待遇必然很低，这笔钱可以作为我生活上的补贴。在这种自私自利，投机取巧的思想驱使下，我就犯了极严重的贪污行为。
    一九五一年初整风的时候，在上级和群众的启发下，我对我的贪污行为作了初步坦白，并交出了钢丝录音机。但是我还没有能够从思想本质上来挖掘我错误的根源，我的单纯技术观点仍未得到彻底的解决，导向我贪污的铺张浪费的思想和行为仍未得到克服。我曾经有一次出差往上海，就挥霍了四百万元。一年来，我在工作上虽然也获得了些小的成就，但这一点是远不能弥补我贪污的罪愆的。
    伟大的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动挽救了我，使我深刻地认识到自己错误的严重性。我所以堕落为盗窃人民财产的蟊贼是和我自私自利，铺张浪费，享乐腐化的资产阶级思想分不开的；但是更严重的是我的单纯技术观点。正是在这种思想支配下，使我在起义的中间动摇不定，立场不稳，产生了极可鄙的投机取巧思想。回国以后，我仍然一贯轻视政治学习，片面强调技术的重要性。直到这一次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开，才使我猛醒过来，才使我认识到单纯技术观点行不通了。没有政治的领导，技术是没有前途的，特别像我这样一个唯利是图的贪污分子，是并不难被敌人收买的。我认识了这种思想的危险性后，才第一次激起我要求彻底改造思想的决心。因此我痛切地在思想上批判了我的贪污罪行，在一阵剧烈的思想斗争以后，我主动地向组织和群众作了彻底而沉痛的坦白。
    坦白以后，我静待组织上的处理。我想在这样猛烈的反贪污斗争中，以我一个罪恶深重的大贪污分子，即使已经作了彻底的坦白，也断不会完全免于人民的惩罚。正在春节中间，我接到局长的电报，令我立刻离开天津到北京来。我预感到我应得的惩罚来了。
    但是在公审大会上，我却受到了人民最宽大的待遇。当我重新回到照满阳光的群众队伍中的时候，我眼睛中噙满了泪水，我重新变成一个人。我深切地体会到：人民政府对于一个自动彻底坦白的贪污分子是多么的宽大。我想起多少天来人民政府一再号召：凡拒不坦白的贪污分子一定从严惩处，凡自动彻底坦白并能立功赎罪的贪污分子一定减轻甚至免予刑事处分。在这个大会上就鲜明地体现了政府的这个政策。人民政府不断号召贪污分子坦白，一再给予反省的机会。薄一波主任在会上还宽逾贪污分子的坦白期限到本月十五日为止。人民政府对于启发贪污分子的坦白，可说已经做到仁至义尽的地步。一切贪污分子特别是大贪污分子应该从我的例子中选择应走的道路；如果再不悔悟，那么只有得到和薛昆山、宋德贵同样的下场。
    这个大会极深刻地教育了我，使我更进一步地认识到共产党和毛主席的英明伟大。我看到无论是党员或是非党员，无论是高级干部或是下级干部，无论是历史上有功或是没有功，只要是盗窃国家财产的蟊贼，他们的待遇只有一种：凡是自动彻底坦白者一定予以减罪或免罪，凡是拒不坦白者一定加重处分直到枪毙，除此以外再无例外。从这里我深切地感到共产党的大公无私和光明磊落，这充分说明全国人民在共产党和毛主席领导下是一定能够打退资产阶级的进攻的，是一定能够迅速地走到幸福美满的社会主义社会的。
    人民对我的宽大处理，更坚定了我立功赎罪的决心。我除了保证今后决不再犯贪污行为和把全部赃款交还国家以外，并要求民航局行政方面给我以应得的处分。今后我决心响应毛主席的号召，彻底改造我的旧思想。随着国家经济建设高潮的来到，技术人员的思想改造就更迫切了。我愿意尽我最大的努力来克服不分敌我的单纯技术观点，并坚决向资产阶级的丑恶思想和行为进行反击，决心把我全部的技术和能力贡献给祖国伟大的建设事业。
    最后我希望一切还在犹豫彷徨的贪污分子赶快醒悟过来，在免刑、徒刑、死刑之间选择你们应该走的道路。方向已经指明了，时间已经不多了，走那一条道路完全取决于你们自己！
