    "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, Issue 126 Introduction
    The Chinese Edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 126, has been published.
    This issue prominently features Stalin's New Year's telegram to Iwamoto, Editor-in-Chief of the Japanese Kyodo News Agency, and publishes an editorial titled "Stalin's Historic Greeting Telegram to the Japanese People," stating: All progressive people in the world welcome Stalin's New Year's greeting telegram to the Japanese people with the utmost satisfaction and joy. This document vividly demonstrates once again that the Soviet Union is peace-loving; it is a typical example of Stalin's peace policy. At a time when American and British imperialists are waging bloody wars against people striving for liberation, preparing for another world massacre, engaging in barbaric intimidation against all progressive forces, and spreading misrepresentations that incite hatred of humanity, this greeting telegram rings the bells of peace and friendship in the hearts of the Japanese people and among other people who have been brutally occupied by American imperialists and their vassal states. The editorial continues by pointing out that the distressful situation the Japanese people are in today is unprecedented in their history. The entire life of Japan, its industry, agriculture, trade, and culture, are dominated by the American occupation authorities. American imperialism wants to push the Japanese people into new wars of aggression, using the hands and blood of the Japanese people to achieve its goal of controlling Asia. However, the working people of Japan see a glimmer of hope in the darkness. The great Stalin has pointed out to them a path towards happiness and national independence. The editorial concludes by saying that Stalin's greeting telegram encourages peace advocates in all countries, enabling them to fight more resolutely against the conspiracies of American and British imperialists and to safeguard and consolidate world peace.
    This issue publishes an excerpt from the speech given by Valko Chervenkov, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, at the National Congress of Stakhanovite Workers and Shock Workers in Industry, Transportation, and Construction last December: "The Development of the Stakhanovite Movement in Bulgaria." Chervenkov pointed out that after Bulgaria was liberated with the help of the Soviet army and established a people's democratic regime, it began to embark on the path of industrialization with the help of the Soviet Union in science and technology. Large industrial enterprises with modern equipment have been established, and the material foundation of industry and its technical equipment is being increasingly consolidated. After becoming the masters of the country, the working class has demonstrated great labor enthusiasm. The socialist production emulation movement has made considerable progress and is becoming a mass movement. Many representatives of the Stakhanovite movement and shock workers have emerged. Therefore, the main conditions for steadily increasing labor productivity—the main method of guaranteeing socialist victory—are already in place. Under these circumstances, the task of the state, the Party, the administration, and the trade unions, as well as the task of industrial workers and all working people, is to develop socialist emulation in every way, to involve an increasingly large number of working people in the emulation; to accept and widely promote creative suggestions, excellent examples in production, and all achievements in work and organization of labor; to improve product quality; to save labor, time, materials, and fuel more effectively; to use machines in the best way; and to reduce the cost of production, construction, and assembly. These are the conditions for further increasing labor productivity and continuing to engage in socialist construction victoriously.
    This issue carries an article by Besenti, a member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, titled "The Italian Communist Party's Struggle for a Peaceful Economy." Besenti said: Just as Italy's entire economy is stagnating and continuously declining, unemployment is increasing, prices are soaring, and the living standards of the working people are deteriorating, the Italian government, adhering to the orders of American imperialists, has shifted Italy's economy to a war footing. Therefore, the struggle for peace under the leadership of the Communist Party is currently being carried out in Italy not only in the form of peace fighters absorbing the masses to participate in the movement against the expansion of armaments and the preparation of war, but also with full economic force. Besenti then described how the Italian Communist Party deputies, when the parliament was discussing the national budget, put forward a budget proposal that was opposed to the government's war preparation budget proposal, advocating for the reduction of military spending, the abolition of armament expansion plans, and the shortening of military service, while at the same time suggesting increasing investment in peaceful industries, increasing appropriations for public utilities, housing construction, and the elimination of unemployment, and implementing a rational tax system. In addition, the Communist Party also drafted some motions advocating for the nationalization of the largest monopoly enterprises. Besenti emphasized that the specific goals indicated by the Communist Party point out the correct path for the Italian people; the Italian people have proven that they are firm and capable in struggle, and have put forward new and effective methods of struggle, linking actions with local significance to national issues related to work and peace. The working class is constantly strengthening its ties with the working people and consolidating the broad front composed of all progressive forces.
    This issue also publishes articles such as "Austrian Youth Defend Peace and Their Rights" by Steiner, Secretary of the Free Austrian Youth League.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二六期介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二六期已经出版。
    本期以显著地位刊载了斯大林致日本共同通讯社总编辑岩本的新年电报，并以“斯大林致日本人民的历史性的贺电”为题发表社论说：世界所有的进步人民都用最满意最高兴的心情来欢迎斯大林致日本人民的新年贺电。这个文件又一次生动地证明了苏联是热爱和平的；它是斯大林和平政策的一个典型。美英帝国主义者正在对争取解放的人民进行血腥的战争，正在准备另一次世界大屠杀，正在对一切进步力量进行横蛮的恫吓并散布仇恨人类的谬论——在这个时候，这个贺电在日本人民的心中，在那些惨遭美帝国主义者及其仆从国家占领的其他人民的心中，响起了和平和友好的钟声。社论接着指出：日本人民今天处境的困苦在他们的历史上是从来没有过的。日本的全部生活，它的工业、农业、贸易和文化都受美国占领当局的支配。美帝国主义要想把日本人民推入新的侵略战争，借日本人民的手和血来达到其控制亚洲的目的。但是，日本劳动人民在黑夜之中看到了一线光明的希望。伟大的斯大林给他们指出了一条走向幸福和民族独立的道路。社论最后说：斯大林的贺电鼓舞了所有国家的和平拥护者，使他们能够更坚决地为反对美英帝国主义者的阴谋、维护和巩固世界和平而斗争。
    本期发表了保加利亚共产党中央委员会总书记契尔文科夫去年十二月在全国工业、运输业、建筑业斯塔哈诺夫式工作者和突击工作者大会上的讲演摘要：“保加利亚斯塔哈诺夫运动的发展情况”。契尔文科夫指出：保加利亚在苏联军队帮助下获得解放并建立人民民主政权以后，又在苏联在科学技术方面的帮助下，开始走上了工业化的道路。拥有现代化设备的大工业企业已经建立起来，工业及其技术装备的物质基础正在日益巩固。工人阶级在变成了国家的主人之后，表现了极大的劳动热情。社会主义生产竞赛运动已有相当大的进展，并正在变成群众性的运动。许多斯塔哈诺夫运动的代表人物和突击工人已经涌现出来。因此，劳动生产率的稳步提高——保证社会主义胜利的主要方法——的主要条件已经具备了。在这种情况下，国家、党、行政和工会的任务，产业工人以及所有劳动人民的任务，就是以各种方式发展社会主义竞赛，使日益广大的劳动人民参加到竞赛中来；接受并广泛宣传创造性的建议、生产中的优良的范例、工作中和组织劳动方面的一切成就；提高产品质量；更有效地节省劳动力、时间、材料和燃料；以最好的方法使用机器；减低生产、建筑和装配的成本。这就是进一步提高劳动生产率、继续胜利地从事社会主义建设的条件。
    本期刊载了意大利共产党中央委员贝森蒂的“意大利共产党争取和平经济的斗争”一文。贝森蒂说：正当意大利的全部经济陷于停滞和不断衰退，失业人口增加、物价猛涨、劳动人民生活水平随着恶化的时候，意大利政府遵守着美帝国主义者的命令，把意大利的经济转移到战争基础上去了。因此，在共产党领导下的争取和平的斗争，目前在意大利就不仅以和平战士吸收广大群众参加反对扩张军备和准备战争的运动这一形式进行，而且也在经济方面全力进行。贝森蒂接着叙述了意大利共产党议员在议会讨论国家预算案时，提出了和政府的备战预算案相对的预算案，主张裁减军费、废除扩张军备计划、缩短兵役期限，并同时建议增加和平工业的投资，增加公用事业、房屋建造和消灭失业的拨款，实行合理的税收制度。此外，共产党还草拟了一些议案，主张将最大的垄断企业收归国有。贝森蒂强调说：共产党所指示的这些具体目标，给意大利人民指出了正确的道路；意大利人民已经证明他们在斗争中是坚定不移的、有能力的，并且已经提出了新的、有效的斗争方法，把具有地方意义的行动和有关工作与和平的全国性问题联系起来。工人阶级正在不断加强和劳动人民的联系，并且把一切进步力量组成的广泛的阵线巩固起来。
    本期还刊载了自由奥地利青年联盟书记斯坦纳的“奥地利青年维护和平与他们的权利”等文章。
