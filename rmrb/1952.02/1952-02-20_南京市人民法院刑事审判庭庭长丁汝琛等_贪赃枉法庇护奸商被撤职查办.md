Ding Ruchen, Deputy Secretary-General and Chief of the Criminal Court of the Nanjing Municipal People's Court, Miao Jingyi, Secretary, Wang Yousheng, Judge of the Criminal Court, Bai Yingzhou, Clerk of the Litigation Section, and others surrendered after failing to withstand the attacks of the bourgeoisie. Some of them were seriously corrupt and perverted the law, becoming loyal servants of the bourgeoisie, while others completely lost their revolutionary stance, causing serious damage to the country. Corrupt elements Ding Ruchen and Wang Yousheng were arrested and investigated on February 10th by Li Leping, Deputy Mayor of Nanjing, at a city-wide conference of judicial workers. The corrupt element Bai Yingzhou was previously dismissed for reflection and is now ordered to explain all his problems clearly within two days. In addition, Yan Siping and Miao Jingyi, who had serious problems, were also announced to be dismissed or suspended for reflection.

Ding Ruchen was one of the main responsible persons of the Communist Party organization and the administrative side of the Nanjing Municipal People's Court. After entering the city, he could not withstand the corrosion of bourgeois ideology, lost his position as a people's judicial worker, and became a protector of illegal merchants, accepting bribes and giving light sentences or even releasing unscrupulous merchants who were sanctioned by national law. For example, Cheng Jialun, the boss of the former Maorong Steel Plant, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison in the summer of 1950 for purchasing a large number of railway tracks and sabotaging the railway. Cheng committed bribery of 4.5 million yuan to Ding Ruchen through corrupt officials such as Li Chengcai. Ding Ruchen tried every means to take advantage of his power, using Cheng's lung disease as an excuse, to declare a suspended sentence and release Cheng Jialun from prison. Another example is Tang Wenhua, the boss of Wenhua Printing Plate Workshop, who was sentenced to five years in prison for counterfeiting currency. After serving only half of his time in prison, Tang committed bribery of 6.8 million yuan through connections. Ding Ruchen then made excuses that Tang committed had "performed very well" in prison and fabricated lies that Tang's printing plate technology was excellent and that the Xinhua Daily Printing Factory needed Tang, deceiving the leadership and paroling Tang out of prison. Another example is Li Renshan, the boss of the unscrupulous merchant Dalai Timber Firm, who was detained in the police and judicial section of the Public Security Bureau for concealing enemy and puppet materials. Li's family bribed corrupt officials Yi Qian, Li Chengcai, etc., with more than 40 million yuan. Li Chengcai then asked Ding Ruchen to find a way. Ding sent a letter to the police and judicial section to release Li Renshan. In addition, he introduced someone who spoke for an unscrupulous merchant who owed more than 1,000 stones of public rice to Judge Yan Siping for private consultation. As a result, one of the main culprits in the case (an anti-revolutionary element) was released, and the whole case was delayed for two years. More than 700 stones of rice are still outstanding. According to the preliminary inspection of the Nanjing Municipal People's Court, there are already more than ten cases related to Ding's bribery and perversion of the law.

The bourgeoisie has made extensive use of retained personnel who have not been reformed in its offensive against the Nanjing Municipal People's Court. For example, unscrupulous merchants Liu Hanzhang, Chen Yuesan, and Liu Baoji operated underground banks in Xiaguan in the autumn of 1949, trafficking in gold and silver, speculating and disrupting finance. After being cracked down, Liu, Chen, and other criminals bribed Judge Wang Yousheng (retained personnel) a total of 21.1 million yuan (a figure from 1949), and often invited Wang and his wife to Liu Baoji's home for eating, drinking, and gambling. Wang then perverted the law and gave Liu and others light sentences. Meng Guanmei, the boss of the former Pufeng Flour Mill and a big traitor, and his brother Meng Huaishan used money, foreign houses, and "deputy manager" positions as bait to induce Miao Jingyi (retained personnel), the court secretary, to be loyal to them. Miao once colluded with Meng to discuss how to suppress the workers, and used his authority to instruct the unit responsible for enforcing the huge tax arrears owed by the Pufeng Factory not to detain Meng Huaishan. In particular, Li Renshan, the boss of the unscrupulous merchant Dalai Timber Firm, not only bribed Li Chengcai and others, but also colluded with Bai Yingzhou (retained personnel), a clerk in the court's litigation section, to destroy the files related to Li Renshan's crimes. Li Renshan also sent his henchman, old lawyer He Yuquan, to the preparatory committee of the Nanjing branch of the New Legal Studies Association stationed in the court to act as a "mole." Li Renshan had more than ten civil cases in the court, and he often used his "mole" to inquire about the situation from the judges and take the opportunity to speak for him. (Note: He Yuquan has been detained.)

Since surrendering to the bourgeoisie, the aforementioned corrupt and lawless elements Ding Ruchen, Wang Yousheng, Bai Yingzhou, Miao Jingyi, etc., have damaged the dignity of the people's judiciary to varying degrees, causing extremely bad influence among the masses and causing great losses to the people's judicial work. But they were stubbornly unrepentant. After the start of the anti-corruption movement, each of them went to make one or several "offensive and defensive alliances" with the relevant parties. In particular, Ding Ruchen went to gather with Li Chengcai and others as late as the evening of December 27 last year to discuss countermeasures. He also used the convenience of his position to secretly destroy the materials related to his denunciations. In group learning, he suppressed democracy in every possible way. For example, Yang Qinlong, a drug trafficker who colluded with Ding Ruchen, was investigated and arrested by the Yuanling Public Security Bureau in Hunan last year for trafficking 864 taels of opium. Some comrades in the Nanjing Municipal People's Court felt that this case was suspicious during the study and suggested that Yang be brought back for processing. Ding immediately became furious and suppressed them. It was not until Mayor Ke Qingshi personally announced his dismissal and demanded that he confess within a time limit that he only talked about some minor problems to prevaricate, and did not thoroughly confess his major crimes. Wang Yousheng refused to confess during his dismissal and reflection period, and secretly sneaked out of the court and made an "alliance" with others, transferring the stolen goods to the homes of unscrupulous merchants Chen Yuesan and others, planning to escape.

    南京市人民法院刑事审判庭庭长丁汝琛等
    贪赃枉法庇护奸商被撤职查办
    南京市人民法院副秘书长兼刑事审判庭庭长丁汝琛、秘书苗敬一、刑事审判庭审判员王有生、讼事科科员白瀛洲等，因为经不起资产阶级的袭击而缴械投降。他们有的严重贪赃枉法，成了资产阶级的忠实奴仆，有的则完全丧失革命立场，给国家造成严重损害。贪污分子丁汝琛、王有生已在二月十日由南京市人民政府李乐平副市长在全市司法工作人员大会上当场宣布逮捕查办。贪污分子白瀛洲前已撤职反省，现又限令他在两天之内把所有问题交代清楚。另外，问题严重的晏嗣平、苗敬一也被分别宣布撤职或停职反省。
    丁汝琛是南京市人民法院共产党组织和行政方面的主要负责人之一。他入城以后，经不住资产阶级思想的腐蚀，丧失人民司法工作人员立场，成了不法商人的保护者，先后接受贿赂和把受到国家法律制裁的奸商轻判甚至释放。例如前茂荣钢铁厂老板程家伦在一九五○年夏因为大量套购铁轨，破坏铁路，被判徒刑二年半。程犯通过贪污犯李成才等向丁汝琛行贿四百五十万元。丁汝琛即多方设法，以程犯身患肺病为藉口，利用职权，宣告缓刑，把程家伦释放出狱。又如文华制版所老板唐文华，因伪造货币案被判徒刑五年，在监狱执行仅及二分之一时间，唐犯通过关系，行贿六百八十万元，丁汝琛即藉口唐犯在监狱“表现很好”，并捏造唐犯制版技术高明，新华日报印刷厂需用唐犯等谎言，欺骗领导，把唐犯假释出狱。又如奸商大来木行老板李仁山，因隐匿敌伪物资案件被押在公安局警法科。李犯家属向贪污分子易潜、李成才等行贿四千余万元，李成才转请丁汝琛设法。丁去函警法科，把李仁山释放。此外他更把一个替亏欠公家大米一千余石的奸商说项的人介绍给审判员晏嗣平私自洽谈，结果案内主犯之一（系反革命分子）被放跑，全案拖延二年未决，欠米七百余石至今没有着落。据南京市人民法院初步检查，和丁的贪赃枉法行为有关的案件已有十多件。
    资产阶级在对南京市人民法院进攻中，曾多方利用了未经改造的留用人员。例如奸商刘汉章、陈月三、刘宝寄等一九四九年秋在下关经营地下钱庄，大量贩卖金银、投机倒把、破坏金融，被破获后，刘、陈等犯向审判员王有生（留用人员）共行贿二千一百万元（是一九四九年的数字），并经常邀王及其妻到刘宝寄家中吃喝赌博，王就枉法把刘等轻判。前普丰面粉厂老板、大汉奸孟冠美及其弟孟怀山则用金钱、洋房、“副经理”等为饵，诱使法院秘书苗敬一（留用人员）为其效忠。苗曾和孟策划如何压制工人，并曾利用职权指示负责强制执行普丰厂所欠巨额税款的单位不要扣押孟怀山。特别是奸商大来木行老板李仁山，不仅向李成才等行贿，并买通法院讼事科科员白瀛洲（留用人员）把保管的和李仁山犯罪有关的档案销毁。李仁山又把他的狗腿子旧律师何宇铨派到驻在法院内的新法学研究会南京分会筹委会来充当“坐探”。李仁山在法院有民事案子十多件，经常通过他的“坐探”向审判人员探听情况并乘机说项。（按：何宇铨已被扣押。）
    前述各贪赃枉法分子丁汝琛、王有生、白瀛洲、苗敬一等自从投降资产阶级以后，都在不同程度内损害了人民司法的尊严，在群众中造成了极其恶劣的影响，使人民司法工作遭受了很大的损失。但他们却执迷不悟，在反贪污运动开始后，每个人都去和有关方面订了一个或几个“攻守同盟”。特别是丁汝琛，直到去年十二月二十七日晚，还去和李成才等集会商讨对策。又利用职权的便利，把有关他的检举材料私自销毁。在小组学习中则多方压制民主。如和丁汝琛勾结的烟毒犯杨钦龙去年因贩运烟土八百六十四两被湖南沅陵公安局查获。南京市人民法院有的同志在学习中认为此案可疑，建议把杨犯提回处理，丁当即大发雷霆，横加压制。直到柯庆施市长亲自宣布把他撤职、限期坦白以后，还只是避重就轻地讲一些细小问题来搪塞，对于主要罪行却不彻底坦白。王有生在撤职反省期中拒不坦白，并私自潜出院外，和别人订立“同盟”，把所得赃物转移到奸商陈月三等家中藏匿，计划逃跑。
