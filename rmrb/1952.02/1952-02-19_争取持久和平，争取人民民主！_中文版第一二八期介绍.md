“Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!” Chinese Edition, Issue 128 Introduction

"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, Issue 128 has been published.

This issue is a special issue commemorating the 28th anniversary of the death of Lenin, the great leader and teacher of the world's working people. This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Victory of Invincible Leninist Thought," which states: Lenin was a great thinker in terms of revolutionary theory, a genius in launching revolution, and the greatest master in leading revolution. In the new historical context, in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, he enriched and further developed the theories of Marx and Engels, making this doctrine the property of the working people and the oppressed people of the world; he defended Marxism against the various revisionist attempts by the "theoreticians" of the Second International to distort Marxism and emasculate its revolutionary essence. Lenin discovered the law of uneven development of capitalism in the imperialist stage, affirmed that imperialism is dying capitalism and the eve of proletarian revolution, and scientifically proved the possibility of socialism first achieving victory in several countries or even in a single country. He armed the working class with a new theory of socialist revolution and further developed Marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The editorial continues: The great Stalin holds high the banner of Lenin and adds brilliance to Lenin's banner with his genius. Under his firm grasp, Lenin's banner flies high all over the world. Although Lenin is dead, his doctrine lives on in the heroic deeds of the great Lenin and Stalin's party—the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; it lives on in the growing and strengthening peace, democracy, and socialism camp; it lives on in the struggle of the people of colonial and dependent countries for national liberation. The editorial concludes: Leninism has achieved victory in the past and present, and it will continue to achieve victory in the future.

This issue publishes commemorative articles such as "Lenin—The Great Peace Fighter" by Wilhelm Pieck, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and "Lenin and Proletarian Internationalism" by Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party. In his article, Pieck described how Lenin, from 1907 to 1922, exposed the ugly faces of the Second International, Trotskyites, and bourgeois lackeys—social chauvinists—and carried out a victorious struggle against war and for peace. He said: Lenin's doctrine on just and unjust wars, his doctrine on the need for all people to rise up against reactionary wars, and his doctrine on the possibility of transforming imperialist war into civil war are the foundations of the struggle to maintain peace. He pointed out: Today, Lenin's scientific analysis of the era of imperialism and his brilliant insights into opposing imperialist war are still fully applicable. In his article, Gheorghiu-Dej pointed out: Lenin and his great student and comrade-in-arms, Stalin, held high the glorious banner of the revolutionary Marxist internationalist tradition and waged a resolute struggle against all opportunists' conspiracies to smuggle bourgeois nationalism into the working-class movement. From the first day of its founding, the Soviet Union has followed the Lenin-Stalin doctrine on proletarian internationalism, fulfilling its international responsibilities and striving to accelerate the liberation of the working people of all countries. Today, in the context of the struggle against the war plans of American and British imperialism and the growing development and consolidation of the world democratic anti-imperialist camp, Lenin's doctrine on proletarian internationalism is of extreme importance to communist and workers' parties, as well as to the working people of the world.

This issue publishes an article by Benoît Frachon, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, entitled "The People's Opposition to War and Poverty Policies is the Main Reason for the French Government's Crisis," analyzing the collapse of the French Pleven government in January of this year. Frachon pointed out: At the behest of the United States, the Pleven government pursued a treasonous policy of preparing for war. This policy of complete obedience to Washington offended the national dignity of the French people and deeply harmed broad social strata. The number of people in France who are determined to put an immediate end to this disastrous policy is growing day by day. Workers, office workers, artisans, merchants, farmers, and manufacturers have expressed dissatisfaction, held protests, or gone on strike. These protests and actions, primarily the unified action achieved by the workers and the unity of the forces for peace and progress, finally led to the disintegration of the reactionary parliamentary majority and the collapse of the Pleven government.

This issue also published a book review by Tserikova, "A Book About the Struggle of a Heroic People," introducing General Kim Il-sung's collection of works, "The Korean People's Great Liberation War for Freedom and Independence."

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二八期介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二八期已经出版。
    本期为纪念世界劳动人民的伟大领袖和导师列宁逝世二十八周年专号。本期发表题为“无敌的列宁思想的胜利”的社论说：列宁在革命理论方面，是大思想家；在发动革命方面，是天才，在领导革命方面，是最伟大的大师。他在新的历史背景下，在帝国主义和无产阶级革命的时代，丰富了并进一步发展了马克思和恩格斯的学说，使这种学说成为劳动人民和世界被压迫人民的财产；他捍卫了马克思主义，反对第二国际的“理论家们”歪曲马克思主义及阉割其革命真义的种种修正主义的企图。列宁发现了资本主义在帝国主义阶段发展的不平衡的规律，肯定了帝国主义是垂死的资本主义，是无产阶级革命的前夜，进而科学地证明了社会主义首先在几个国家甚或单独在一个国家内取得胜利的可能性。他以新的社会主义革命的理论武装了工人阶级，并进一步发展了马克思关于无产阶级专政的学说。社论接着说：伟大的斯大林高举着列宁的旗帜，并以他的天才为列宁的旗帜增加了光辉。在他的坚定的掌握下，列宁的旗帜高高地飘扬于全世界。虽然列宁已经死了，但是他的学说，却活在伟大的列宁和斯大林的党——苏联共产党的英勇业迹中；活在日益发展和壮大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营中；活在殖民地和附属国人民争取民族解放的斗争中。社论最后说：列宁主义过去和现在都取得了胜利，今后也必将继续取得胜利。
    本期发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会主席皮克的“列宁——伟大的和平战士”和罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记波克的“列宁与无产阶级国际主义”等纪念文章。皮克在文章中叙述了列宁在一九○七年到一九二二年间，揭露第二国际、托洛茨基分子和资产阶级走狗——社会沙文主义者的丑恶面目，进行反对战争、争取和平的胜利斗争的情形，他说：列宁关于正义战争和非正义战争的学说，关于全体人民需要起来反对反动战争的学说，关于变帝国主义战争为国内战争的可能性的学说，乃是维护和平的斗争的基础。他指出：今天，列宁关于帝国主义时代的科学分析，关于反对帝国主义战争的英明见解，仍然完全适用。波克在文章中指出：列宁和他的伟大学生与战友斯大林，高举起革命的马克思主义的国际主义传统的光荣旗帜，并对一切机会主义者想把资产阶级的民族主义偷偷地输送到工人阶级运动中来的阴谋，进行了坚决的斗争。苏联从立国的第一天开始，就遵循着列宁—斯大林关于无产阶级国际主义的学说，履行它的国际责任，为加速各国劳动人民的解放而奋斗。今天，在进行反对美英帝国主义战争计划的斗争情况下，在世界民主反帝国主义阵营的日益发展和巩固的情况下，列宁关于无产阶级国际主义的学说，对于共产党和工人党，正像对全世界劳动人民一样，具有极端重大的意义。
    本期刊载了法国共产党中央委员邦特的“人民对于战争与贫穷政策的反对是法国政府危机的主要原因”一文，分析法国普利文政府在今年一月垮台的情况。邦特指出：普利文政府在美国的命令下，奉行了准备战争的卖国政策，这种完全听命于华盛顿的政策，冒犯了法国人民的民族尊严，并使广大的社会阶层都深受其害。法国人民中表示决心要使这种招致灾难的政策立即结束的人，是一天比一天多了。工人、职员、手工业者、商人、农民和制造商纷纷表示不满，举行抗议或罢工。这些抗议和行动，首先是工人所获致的统一行动以及和平进步力量的团结一致，终于使议会反动的多数派分崩离析，使普利文政府垮台。
    本期还发表了柴利珂瓦的书评“关于英雄人民的斗争的一部书”，介绍金日成将军的文集“朝鲜人民的争取自由与独立的伟大解放战争”。
