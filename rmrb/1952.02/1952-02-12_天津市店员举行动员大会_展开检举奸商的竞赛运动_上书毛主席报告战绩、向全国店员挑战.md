Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, February 11th: The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees Union held a mobilization meeting on February 11th for the city's shop assistants' anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state property, anti-shoddy workmanship, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence campaign, a "tiger-catching" competition. More than 1,000 people attended the meeting, including representatives of shop assistants' combat groups and union cadres from across the city. The meeting adopted a letter to Chairman Mao and a challenge letter to shop assistants nationwide.

The meeting began with a report by Hu Yingui, Director of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees Union, on the progress of the movement and the heroic deeds of shop assistants in the struggle. He said: A mass "tiger-beating" movement has been launched among the city's 70,000 shop assistants. Two hundred and seventy-six combat groups have been established across the city, and 177 "big tigers" who have stolen more than 1 billion yuan of state property have been caught. The vast number of shop assistants are engaging in battle with the spirit of not withdrawing until complete victory, and many model combat groups and model shop assistants have emerged. One combat group in the seventh district caught five "big tigers" in ten days. After Han Jiasheng, a shop assistant in the first district, reported his uncle's crime of stealing state property, he joined a combat group, stayed up for two days and two nights, and lost his voice. When someone advised him to rest, he always said, "The soldiers of the Volunteer Army do not leave the front line with minor injuries. My little illness is nothing."

Hao Yiping, a representative of the North China sub-group of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, reported at the meeting on the Volunteer Army's bravery in fighting the enemy on the Korean front and their frugality in difficult circumstances. He said: The shop assistants of Tianjin have made great contributions in the fight against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence, repelling the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie; we also guarantee to eliminate more American aggressors on the Korean front. Hao Yiping's speech aroused lasting applause from all attendees.

Liu Ya, Chairman of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees Union, made a report at the meeting. He pointed out: In order to concentrate our strength and increase our firepower, we must unite the senior staff in the shops to participate in this movement. Shop employees must continue to act boldly and actively, and thoroughly expose those cunning, movement-sabotaging, unscrupulous merchants and "big tigers," leaving no one behind.

Huang Huoqing, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Savings Inspection Committee and Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, also spoke at the meeting. He called on shop assistants throughout the city not to be complacent, to continue the fight, to make the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state property, anti-shoddy workmanship, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement more thorough, and to achieve final victory.

Shop assistants attending the meeting proposed friendly challenges and responses. All members of the trade warehouse industry combat group of the 10th District Shop Employees Union took an oath at the meeting. In their oath, they said: "We vow with the greatest determination to strive to make contributions to the people in this movement, and we will never withdraw until victory."

All the shop assistant representatives attending the meeting, amidst warm applause, approved the letter to Chairman Mao and the challenge letter to shop assistants nationwide.

Letter to Chairman Mao
Respected Chairman Mao:

Under your leadership and call, our 70,000 shop assistants in Tianjin have formed a strong fighting army, including 276 combat groups. In the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence, we have adopted the tactics of surrounding at all levels and attacking from both inside and outside, launching a strong counterattack against the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive. From January 20th to date, we have captured 177 "big tigers" who have evaded taxes, offered bribes, and stolen state property worth more than 1 billion yuan. This is the first victory in the counterattack against illegal merchants. In the future, we will further mobilize shop assistants throughout the city, make persistent efforts, pursue the victory, and never withdraw until complete victory.

We are confident that under your wise leadership, we will achieve greater victories and catch more "big tigers."

Respectfully wishing you good health.

Challenge Letter to Shop Assistants Nationwide

Comrades shop assistants across the country:

For the past three years, the bourgeoisie has been carrying out rampant attacks on the state and the people with "sugar-coated bullets" and various despicable and shameless acts, causing serious damage to the country's political and economic construction. In the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state property, anti-shoddy workmanship, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement, we have clearly recognized the reactionary, backward, corrupt, and decadent nature of the bourgeoisie. The people of the whole country must be vigilant, mobilize, and launch a resolute and thorough counterattack against the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive.

In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call with practical actions, 70,000 shop assistants in Tianjin have formed a fighting army against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence; and have formed 276 strong combat groups to launch a fierce counterattack against the bourgeoisie's offensive. From January 6th to date, more than 24,000 cases of tax evasion, bribery, and theft of state property have been reported, and 177 "big tigers" who have stolen state property worth more than 1 billion yuan have been caught. This is the first major victory for the city's shop assistants in their counterattack against the bourgeoisie. This victory not only further encourages the fighting courage of Tianjin's shop assistants, but also teaches all illegal merchants who refuse to confess and attempt to stubbornly resist the lessons they deserve and righteous judgment.

Tianjin shop assistants are willing to unite closely with shop assistant brothers all over the country, form a fighting army on a national scale, surround the enemy at all levels, set up a "net," cut off the retreat of illegal merchants, and force them to bow their heads and admit their guilt. We hereby launch a friendly challenge to you, and ask the shop employees' unions in various places to inform all the shop employee brothers in your city to mobilize and actively respond to the challenge!

1. Our 70,000 shop assistants throughout the city, with high patriotic enthusiasm and a fighting attitude, consciously and actively participate in the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence, and further promote the movement more widely and deeply;

2. Under the unified leadership of the Communist Party of China, in close coordination with the Youth League, strengthen our fighting power, use our brains, create methods, and launch a "tiger-catching" competition to ensure that each combat group catches at least one "big tiger";

3. With the combat policy of "stability," "accuracy," and "ruthlessness," take advantage of the victory and pursue quickly, resolutely smash the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive, hold the determination of "eliminating evil completely," and never withdraw until complete victory;

4. Strengthen propaganda and education work, understand the essence of the bourgeoisie, constantly improve our class consciousness in the great class struggle, eliminate ideological concerns, and bravely and boldly report the evil deeds of illegal merchants;

5. Do not be arrogant or complacent, and always be vigilant against the rumors and sabotage of illegal merchants.

With revolutionary salutations,
Tianjin City Shop Employees Anti-Bribery, Anti-Tax Evasion, Anti-Theft of State Property, Anti-Shoddy Workmanship, Anti-Theft of State Economic Intelligence Movement Tiger-Catching Competition Mobilization Meeting
February 11th

    向全国店员挑战书全国各地店员同志们：
    三年来，资产阶级有计划地用“糖衣炮弹”及各种卑鄙无耻的行为，向国家人民进行着猖狂的进攻，使国家政治与经济建设上遭受到严重的损失，在反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动中，我们清楚地认识了资产阶级反动的、落后的、腐朽和堕落的本质，全国人民必须警惕起来，动员起来，向资产阶级的猖狂进攻进行坚决的、彻底的反击。
    天津市七万店员为了以实际行动响应毛主席的号召，组成了一支反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的战斗大军；并编成了二百七十六个坚强的战斗小组，向资产阶级的进攻展开了猛烈的反击。由一月六日开始截至目前为止，共检举了偷税、行贿、盗窃国家资财等案达二万四千余件，并捉住了盗窃国家资财十亿元以上的“大老虎”一百七十七个，这是全市店员向资产阶级反攻中第一个大胜仗。这一胜利不仅是进一步地鼓舞天津店员的斗争勇气，同时使一切拒不坦白企图顽强抵抗的不法奸商得到应有的教训和正义的裁判。
    天津店员愿和全国各地店员兄弟们，紧密地团结起来，形成全国范围的战斗大军，将敌人层层包围，布好“天罗地网”，截断不法奸商的退路，迫使他们低头认罪。我们特地向你们发起友谊挑战，要各地店员工会转告你市全体店员兄弟，动员起来，积极应战，是盼！
    一、我们全市七万店员，以高度的爱国热情，战斗的姿态，自觉地积极地参加反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的斗争，把运动更广泛更深入地向前推进一步；

    三、以“稳”“准”“狠”乘胜急追的战斗方针，坚决粉碎资产阶级的猖狂进攻，抱定“除恶务尽”的决心，不到全胜，决不收兵；
    四、加强宣传教育工作，从本质上认识资产阶级，在伟大的阶级斗争中，不断地提高我们的阶级觉悟，解除思想顾虑，勇敢大胆地检举不法商人的罪恶行为；
    五、不骄傲，不自满，随时警惕不法商人的造谣破坏。
