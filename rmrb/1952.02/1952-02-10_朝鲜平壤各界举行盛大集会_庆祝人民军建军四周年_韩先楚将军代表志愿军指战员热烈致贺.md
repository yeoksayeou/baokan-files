The leader of the Korean people and Supreme Commander of the People's Army, General Kim Il-sung, personally attended.

Among those attending the conference were Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea; Vice Premiers of the Cabinet Park Heon-yeong, Hong Myeong-hui, and Heo Ga-i; Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Park Jeong-ae, Lee Seung-yeop, and Park Chang-ok; Minister of National Defence of the Cabinet Choi Yong-kun; Minister of Internal Affairs Park Il-u and other party and government leaders; Director of the General Political Bureau of the People's Army Kim Jae-wook, Deputy Chief of Staff Zhang Pingshan and other senior generals of the People's Army, combat heroes; heads of various democratic parties and social organizations; workers, peasants, youth, women, and cultural, educational, and artistic workers from the Pyongyang area, and others.

Soviet Ambassador to Korea, Razzovayev, Chinese Ambassador to Korea, Ni Zhiliang, diplomatic envoys from various people's democratic countries to Korea, and Chinese People's Volunteer Army representatives General Han Xianchu and General Liang Xingchu were also invited to attend.

At exactly 7 o'clock, the presidium of the conference, headed by General Kim Il-sung, entered the venue, and the entire audience rose to salute, with warm applause and cheers that lasted for a long time.

After Kim Seong-hak, Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, announced the opening of the conference, everyone stood up in unison and, amidst thunderous applause, unanimously approved the election of Marshal Stalin and Chairman Mao Zedong as honorary chairmen of the conference.

Minister of National Defence of Korea, General Choi Yong-kun, delivered a commemorative report at the conference. He first praised the heroic Korean People's Army, standing on the front line of defending world peace, for the brilliant victories it had achieved in the just war of resisting American imperialist aggression alongside the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He said: The young Korean People's Army, with only four years of history, has demonstrated heroism in the great Fatherland Liberation War, not only fulfilling the glorious mission of defending its own country and world peace but also developing into a powerful armed force, accumulating rich combat experience, and further improving its political qualities. He emphasized that if the American aggressors believe that our peaceful policies indicate our weakness, and if the American aggressors resolutely refuse to abandon their armed aggression against Korea, then they will inevitably suffer even more disastrous and shameful defeats.

General Han Xianchu, representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, extended warm congratulations on behalf of all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the glorious founding anniversary of the Korean People's Army, congratulated the Korean People's Army on achieving more brilliant victories in the anti-aggression struggle, and read out the congratulatory telegram from Commander Peng Dehuai of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to Supreme Commander Kim Il-sung of the Korean People's Army on the spot. Then, the representative of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army presented the conference with a large red satin banner embroidered with: "Respectfully wishing the heroic Korean People's Army a long life." During the flag presentation ceremony, the entire audience stood up, and the sounds of military music, applause, and cheers intertwined, brimming with an atmosphere of friendship, unity, and victory between the Korean and Chinese peoples.

Kim Dal-hyun, representative of the Korean Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, delivered a congratulatory speech at the conference. He stated that all patriotic political parties and social organizations are determined to further strengthen unity with the Korean Workers' Party as the center, fully support the bravely fighting Korean and Chinese People's forces, consolidate the rear, and strive for greater victories in the anti-aggression war.

Finally, the conference unanimously adopted congratulatory telegrams to General Kim Il-sung, Marshal Stalin, and Chairman Mao Zedong. After the meeting, the Korean People's Army Ensemble performed celebratory programs.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 9th: Our frontline reporter reports: The glorious Korean People's Army is warmly celebrating the fourth anniversary of its founding with full confidence in victory in the anti-aggression war for the defense of the country.

On February 8, the mountain positions guarded by the People's Army were filled with jubilation, and slogans such as "Long live the Fatherland" and "Long live General Kim Il-sung" echoed throughout the valleys. The officers and soldiers of the People's Army sang the majestic People's Army anthem. At the entrances of the shelters of many units, couplets were posted saying, "The People's Army grows stronger in battle, making great contributions to the war of national defense." Pictures of General Kim Il-sung were hung in the shelters. The officers and soldiers solemnly swore: "To fight to the end for the independence and freedom of the motherland, and for the defense of peace in the Far East and the world!" On this day, celebration meetings were enthusiastically held in all frontline units.

The head of a certain unit of the People's Army guarding the eastern coastal front, at the unit's celebration meeting, called on all commanders and fighters to carry forward the glorious tradition of heroic and arduous combat, and to continue to learn from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, better coordinate with the Chinese People's Volunteer Army in combat, and strive for greater victories in the anti-aggression war. In the People's Army units behind the battle lines, various competitions such as military technology and artistic performances were generally held, reviewing the strong forces that had grown in strength during the battles. Many units also jointly held grand commemorative meetings with the local people's governments and the masses. The Korean people wholeheartedly love their own soldiers and presented a large number of comfort goods, letters of sympathy, and embroidered banners to the heroic soldiers who defend the motherland.

Filled with confidence in victory, the commanders and fighters of the People's Army, in the joyous days of commemorating the founding of the army, also wrote letters to their closest comrades-in-arms—the commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army—deeply thanking the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for their great assistance to them, and expressing their determination to fight unremittingly to defend the motherland and world peace.
