    [Report from this newspaper] Under the leadership of local shop employee unions, vast numbers of shop employees in cities such as Beijing, Wuhan, Xi'an, Chongqing, and Kunming are actively deploying combat forces to coordinate with the inspection work of the People's Government, attacking the stubborn strongholds of unscrupulous merchants from both inside and outside. In Beijing, shop employees continue their unyielding struggle against illegal capitalists, and the exposure movement has become more widespread and deepened. As of February 1st, according to incomplete statistics, the number of illegal acts by unscrupulous merchants exposed by shop employees throughout the city has increased to more than 11,000. Shop employees are further exposing the major criminal activities of illegal capitalists. For example, after striving for and uniting with the staff, the employees of Qixin Rubber Factory exposed the crime of the capitalist stealing more than 2 billion yuan of state assets. Many shop employees have handed over the capitalists' black accounts to the union. In the course of the struggle, illegal capitalists have used conspiracies such as division, bribery, and closure and layoffs to sabotage, but all have been crushed in the face of the solidarity and reasoned struggle of the shop employees. For example, during the Spring Festival, the capitalist of Yanjing Photo Studio in the First District wanted to invite shop employees to eat dumplings in batches for five days. The shop employees saw that the capitalist's conspiracy was to divide and buy off the shop employees, so they held a meeting and made a pact, saying, "If we go, we go together, we can't go alone." Seeing that his conspiracy had failed, the capitalist did not dare to invite the shop employees to dinner. In the First District, the capitalists of seven or eight iron factories threatened not to pay double wages, and the workers immediately organized a reasoning team to fight with the capitalists. The capitalist was wrong, and had to pay double wages as usual. Some illegal capitalists also threatened with closure and layoffs, which also failed. Against a part of the illegal capitalists who obstructed and attempted to retaliate against shop employees, the shop employees, under the leadership of the district's thrift inspection committee, launched a reasoned struggle against the capitalists. Liu Rongfu, the deputy manager of Zhongtian Western Clothing Store in the First District, did not confess himself and obstructed the shop employees from making accusations. The shop employees exposed the capitalists' crimes at the struggle meeting and demanded that the government arrest and prosecute him. After the unscrupulous merchants Guo Ze and Zhang Fuyun and others from Deshengtai Grain Store and Dexing Grain Store in the Seventh District were exposed by the shop employees, they attempted to retaliate by laying off workers. The shop employees also conducted a reasoned struggle against the capitalists and achieved victory.
    The shop employees' understanding of the union has also improved. Many shop employees who had not joined the union in the past are now asking to join the union. More than 1,000 shop employees in the Fourth District of Beijing have applied for membership.
    Since participating in this struggle in early January, the shop employees of Wuhan City have reported more than 9,300 cases of illegal merchants as of February 1. In order to completely smash the conspiracies of unscrupulous merchants to undermine the struggle of shop employees, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees' Union, with the cadres of the union and the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions as the backbone, widely absorbed activists among shop employees to form a working team of more than 1,000 people, and went deep into the five key industries of hardware, import and export, Lianye (including paper, stationery, etc.), pharmaceuticals, and local products to mobilize the masses of shop employees to launch a more fierce struggle. The working team successively held mobilization and inspection meetings in grassroots trade unions and key stores, repeatedly explained the nature and policies of this struggle to the shop employees, used various practical examples to conduct class education for them, so that they could ideologically draw a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and explained to the shop employees that even if some people had engaged in bribery and acceptance of bribes in the past, they were all instructed by the capitalists, as long as they told the truth, they would not be subject to legal punishment. After the shop employees were inspired and supported by the working team, their fighting spirit greatly increased. The employees of Ruichang Hardware Company exposed 29 cases in one night, and from exposing cases of general bribery of cadres, they went on to expose major cases of unscrupulous merchants stealing state property. In order to mobilize shop employees who hold important jobs such as accounting to participate in the accusation, the working teams of various key industries held forums or talked to them individually, inspiring them to recall the exploitation and abuse they suffered from the capitalists in the past, and from the comparison of work and life before and after liberation, recognize the selfish and self-interested nature of unscrupulous merchants, so that they can break the personal ties of relatives and old clients, and boldly expose them. Xiang Qingguan, the head accountant of Hankou Jincheng Stationery and Instrument Company, under this kind of education and enlightenment, broke the personal ties and exposed all 19 major crimes he knew about tax evasion, private exchange of foreign exchange, etc. In the process of mobilizing shop employees to fight against unscrupulous merchants, the working team discovered that some illegal capitalists or their agents had infiltrated into grassroots trade union organizations and obstructed the struggle of shop employees. The working team has paid attention to cleansing these class dissidents to strengthen the fighting power of shop employees.
    The Xi'an Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened the Second Representative Conference of Shop Employees, Apprentices, and Handicraft Workers of the city on February 2nd. The more than 1,000 representatives attending the meeting exposed many illegal acts of illegal industrialists and merchants. Preliminary statistics show that from January 6th to the present, the evil facts of illegal industrialists and merchants have been exposed, approaching 6,000 cases. At the meeting, many model shop employees who waged resolute struggles against illegal capitalists were commended. Ma Hansan, Vice Chairman of Xi'an Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, Zhao Boping, Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman of the Xi'an Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and others spoke at the meeting. They unanimously praised the achievements made by shop employees, apprentices, and handicraft workers in Xi'an in the struggle, called for continued efforts, bravely rushed to the front line, boldly exposed and revealed, and pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to deepen mobilization, investigate cases with emphasis, and each grassroots organization of shop employee unions should make plans, inspect each other, and summarize work in a timely manner. Comrade Zhao Boping, on behalf of the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee, called on all shop employees in the city not to be suppressed or obstructed by any threats or inducements from unscrupulous merchants, to believe that the People's Government would support them, and to strive to take the initiative to expose the illegal acts of capitalists. Workers and apprentices who suffered persecution from the unscrupulous merchant Ren Shengtang in the Seventh District, under the protection of the government, resumed their work and came to participate in the meeting. Representatives of veteran shop employees and handicraft workers from the Second District, Seventh District, and Sixth District took the stage to accuse the manager of illegally smuggling and secretly withdrawing large amounts of funds, saying: "As long as the government supports us, we will definitely stand firm and not leave the front line without making contributions!" The working committee of the shop employees union in the Seventh District of Xi'an and five other units submitted letters of determination, guaranteeing to do a good job in the accusation. The conference finally adopted a letter to the workers of the city.
    The Chongqing Municipal Shop Employees' Union convened a citywide shop employee representative conference on the 1st to deploy combat forces and step up the encirclement and suppression of "big tigers" among unscrupulous merchants. Wang Weigang, Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech the future direction of the struggle: First, clarify that the goal of the struggle is to oppose the five aspects of bribery, tax evasion, and other illegal activities by the bourgeoisie; concentrate all efforts to capture big embezzlers, big bribe-takers, and big thieves. Secondly, trade unions at all levels must redeploy combat forces, improve the command headquarters, further mobilize shop employees in a comprehensive and in-depth manner, and surround and capture "big tigers" within a time limit; if a trade union leadership organ does not play a role, or even obstructs the movement, it must be immediately re-elected; trade union cadres who have not thoroughly confessed to corruption and bribery and do not counterattack the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie must be removed from their posts. Cao Diqiu, Mayor of Chongqing Municipal People's Government, put forward specific measures to support shop employees: guarantee the occupation of the accusers; industrialists and merchants are not allowed to prevent shop employees from participating in the struggle against bribery and tax evasion, or deliberately fail to pay wages and annual bonuses; illegal industrialists and merchants who use vicious means to force shop employees to death must be severely punished according to law; shop employees who have been dragged down by the capitalists, as long as they thoroughly confess and actively accuse unscrupulous merchants, the government will leniently deal with or exempt them from punishment. Inspired by patriotic enthusiasm, all the representatives exposed 1,482 crimes of illegal industrialists and merchants on the spot.
    Shop employees in Kunming City are paying attention to uniting senior staff in private enterprises to effectively combat the conspiracies of unscrupulous merchants to win over some senior staff, undermine worker unity, and resist the movement. For example, at the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion and fraud, and anti-theft of state property conference held by more than 60,000 people in Kunming on January 22, senior staff from various industries participated in the accusation. Zhao Qingcai, the accounting director of Wantong Company, and Wu Kai, the accounting director of Southeast Xingye Company, under the help of the shop employees union, exposed the crimes of the capitalist forging false accounts and smuggling to evade taxes.

    北京、武汉、西安、重庆、昆明等城市
    广大店员工人积极检举奸商
    坚决粉碎资方威胁利诱的各种阴谋诡计
    【本报讯】北京、武汉、西安、重庆、昆明等城市广大店员工人，在各地店员工会领导下，正积极部署战斗力量，配合人民政府的检查工作，内外夹攻奸商的顽固堡垒。北京市店员工人继续和不法资本家进行不屈不挠的斗争，检举运动已进一步普遍和深入。到二月一日止，据不完全统计，经全市店员检举出来的不法商人的违法行为已增加到一万一千多件。店员们正进一步检举不法资方的大的犯罪行为。如企新橡胶厂店员经过争取和团结职员的工作，就检举出资方盗窃国家资财达二十亿元以上的罪恶。许多店员都把资方的黑账交给了工会。在斗争过程中，不法资方曾施用分化、收买、歇业解雇等阴谋诡计来进行破坏，但都在店员们的团结和说理斗争面前被粉碎了。如一区燕京照相馆资方在春节期间要分批请店员吃五天饺子。店员看出资本家的阴谋是要分化和收买店员，便开会订出公约，大家说：“要去一齐去，不能单独去。”资本家看见自己的阴谋失败了，就没敢请店员吃饭。一区有七、八家铁工厂的资方以不发双薪来威胁，工人们即组织说理队去和资本家进行斗争。资方理屈，只好照发双薪。还有些不法资本家以歇业解雇来威胁，也同样遭到了失败。对一部分阻挠及企图报复店员的不法资方，店员们在区节约检查委员会的领导下，对资方展开了说理斗争。一区中天西服行副经理刘荣甫自己不坦白，并阻挠店员进行检举，店员们即在斗争大会上揭发了资方的罪恶，并要求政府逮捕法办。七区德盛泰粮店、德兴粮店资方郭泽、张辅云等奸商被店员检举后，企图以解雇来进行报复，店员们也对资方进行了说理斗争，并取得了胜利。
    店员们对工会的认识也提高了，许多过去没有入会的店员现在都要求加入工会。北京市第四区就有一千多个店员提出入会要求。
    武汉市全市店员自一月上旬参加这一斗争后，至二月一日止，检举不法商人的案件已有九千三百多件。为了彻底粉碎奸商破坏店员工人斗争的阴谋诡计，中国店员工会武汉市委员会以该会和武汉市总工会的干部为骨干，广泛吸收店员工人中的积极分子，组成一支一千余人的工作队，深入五金、进出口、联业（包括纸张、文具等业）、药业、土产五大重点行业中发动店员群众更猛烈地展开斗争。工作队先后在基层工会和重点商店中召开动员、检查大会，反复向店员们讲明这次斗争的性质和政策，用各种实际事例向他们进行阶级教育，使他们从思想上划清工人阶级和资产阶级的界限，并向店员说明即使有些人过去有过行贿、受贿行为，都是资本家所指使的，只要说出来，不受法律处分。店员们受到工作队这种启发和支持后，斗争情绪大为高涨，瑞昌五金公司的店员在一个晚上就检举了二十九件，并由检举一般行贿干部的案件进而检举奸商盗窃国家财产的重大案件。为了发动担任会计等重要工作的店员参加检举，各重点行业的工作队分别召开座谈会或和他们个别谈话，启发他们回忆过去所受资本家的剥削和虐待，并从解放前后的工作和生活对比中认清奸商的自私自利的本质，使他们打破亲戚和老宾东的情面，大胆起来检举。汉口金城文具仪器公司主办会计向庆观就在这种教育启发下，打破私人情面，把自己知道的十九件有关偷税漏税、私套外汇等重大罪行全部检举出来。工作队在发动店员与奸商作斗争的过程中，发现某些不法资本家或其代理人混入基层工会组织，阻挠店员们的斗争，对于这些阶级异己分子，工作队已注意加以清洗，以加强店员工人的战斗力量。
    西安市总工会二月二日召开了全市店员、学徒、手工业工人第二次代表会议。参加会议的千余名代表，检举了很多不法工商业者的不法行为。初步统计自一月六日到现在，检举不法工商业者的罪恶事实，已接近六千件。会上，很多和不法资方进行坚决斗争的模范的店员，都受到了表扬。西安市总工会副主席马汉三，中共西安市委员会书记、西安市总工会主席赵伯平等都在会上讲了话。他们一致表扬了西安市店员学徒手工业工人在斗争中取得的成绩，号召再接再厉，勇猛地开上火线，大胆检举揭发，并指出今后必须深入动员，有重点地追查案件，各个店员工会基层组织，应做出计划，互相检查，及时总结工作。赵伯平同志代表市节约检查委员会，号召全市店员工人不为奸商任何威胁、利诱手段所压制和阻止，相信人民政府撑腰，争取主动揭发资方的不法行为。遭受七区不法商人任生堂迫害的工人学徒，在政府保护下，恢复了工作，也赶来参加大会。当场并有二区、七区、六区老店员和手工业工人代表上台，检举经理非法走私和暗抽大量资金的事实，他们说：“只要政府给咱们撑腰，咱们一定站稳立场，不立功，不下火线！”西安市第七区店员工会工作委员会等六个单位提出决心书，保证搞好检举。大会最后通过了告全市工人书。
    重庆市店员工会在一日召开全市店员代表大会，部署战斗力量，加紧围剿奸商中的“大老虎”。重庆市总工会主席王维纲在讲话中指出今后斗争方向：第一，明确斗争目标是反对资产阶级行贿、偷税漏税等五个方面；要集中全力来捕捉大贪污犯、大行贿犯、大偷窃犯等。其次，各级工会要重新部署战斗力量，健全作战指挥部，进一步全面深入地动员店员，限期包围捕获“大老虎”；如果那一个工会领导机关不起作用，甚至阻挠运动，必须立即改选；工会干部中有贪污受贿不彻底坦白、不向资产阶级的猖狂进攻进行反攻的，一律撤职。重庆市人民政府市长曹荻秋提出了给店员工人撑腰的具体办法：保证检举人的职业；不准工商业者阻止店员参加反行贿、反偷漏税款等斗争，以及故意不发工资年奖；不法工商业者施用毒辣手段逼死店员的，一定依法严办；曾被资方拉下水的店员，只要彻底坦白交代，并积极检举不法商人，政府决从轻处理或免予处分。全体代表在爱国热情鼓舞下，当场检举了不法工商业者的罪行一千四百八十二件。
    昆明市店员工人正注意团结私营企业中的高级职员，有力地打击不法商人拉拢部分高级职员，破坏职工团结，抗拒运动的阴谋。例如在一月二十二日昆明市六万多人举行的反行贿、反偷漏诈骗、反盗窃国家财产大会上，就有各行业的高级职员参加检举。万通公司会计主任赵清材、东南兴业公司会计主任吴凯等，经过店员工会帮助，检举了资方造假账，走私漏税等罪行。
