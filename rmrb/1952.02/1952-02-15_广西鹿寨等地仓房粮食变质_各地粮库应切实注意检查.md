    Grain Deterioration in Warehouses in Luzhai, Guangxi, and Other Places
    Grain Depots in Various Regions Should Pay Close Attention to Inspection
    Editor: Some stored grain in Luzhai, Zhongdu, and other places in Guangxi Province has experienced spoilage, such as mold and germination. The reasons are that the moisture content of the grain was too high when it was put into storage, it was piled too tightly after storage, and the residual heat did not dissipate. The heat continued to radiate upwards, encountering the cold air above, condensing into water droplets, causing the grain to heat up, ferment, mold, and sprout. On the other hand, it is because the cadres responsible for storing grain do not pay enough attention to storage work, do not conduct in-depth inspections, and do not pay attention to reducing the moisture content of the grain. It is hoped that the local government and grain storage departments will immediately inspect and think of more ways to reduce losses to the people's grain.

    广西鹿寨等地仓房粮食变质
    各地粮库应切实注意检查
    编辑同志：广西省鹿寨、中渡等地部分库存粮食，发生生霉、发芽等变质现象。其原因是粮食入库时水分过高，入库后堆得太紧，余热未散，热量继续向上发散，遇着上面冷气，凝成水点，引起粮食发热发酵、生霉、出芽；另一方面是由于我们保管粮食的干部不重视保管工作，不深入检查，不注意减低粮食的水分。希望当地政府和保管粮食的部门立即检查，并多想办法，使人民的粮食少受损失。
