    Central Heavy Industry Department Steel Industry Bureau Deputy Director Lu Da Dismissed for Violating Financial Discipline; He Falsified Final Accounts by Over 50 Billion Yuan Out of Localism
    Lu Da, Deputy Director of the Steel Industry Bureau of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry, violated financial discipline out of localism, falsified the 1950 basic construction final accounts of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and falsely reported a total workload of 50.03 billion yuan, causing significant losses to the basic construction of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has dismissed Lu Da and issued a notice to all departments under the Ministry of Heavy Industry to learn a lesson from this incident.
    Lu Da's unorganized and undisciplined behavior stemming from localism was not accidental. The basic construction tasks of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant for 1950 had already been stipulated by the 1949 National Steel Conference and approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. However, in April 1950, Lu Da and Zhong Lin, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, arbitrarily revised and expanded the basic construction tasks of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and modified the annual engineering plan without authorization. Before the changed and added engineering projects were approved by higher authorities and the engineering budget was made, Lu Da ordered Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant to start all projects in May and June. In October 1950, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council instructed to retain the largest repair and manufacturing department project of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. Lu Da withheld the instructions of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council in the Steel Industry Bureau and did not implement them. On September 21, Lu Da also wrote a letter to Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, asking them to purchase a large amount of materials and quickly spend the basic construction funds for 1950. On December 31, 1950, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council issued instructions clearly stipulating that all unfinished basic construction projects and remaining funds for 1950 should be returned to the Central Ministry of Finance, and the remaining materials and deposit prepayments for goods should be held by each ministry and transferred back to the Ministry of Finance as a transfer to offset the 1951 investment. On January 11, 1951, the Ministry of Heavy Industry forwarded this decision and issued supplementary instructions, ordering all departments under its jurisdiction to implement it. However, Lu Da refused to implement the decision of the higher authorities. After the real final accounts of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant were sent to the bureau on February 22, 1951, he instructed the planning department of the Steel Industry Bureau to work with Li Shuren, Deputy Director of the Basic Construction Department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, to revise the final accounts, fabricating projects and allocating a total of 50.03 billion yuan for advance deposits, materials in transit, and temporary payments into the engineering final accounts. Even Li Feiping, Director of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, did not know about this false final account until it was discovered by the Ministry of Heavy Industry in September 1951.

    Under the guidance of Lu Da's erroneous thinking, the basic construction of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant in 1950 and 1951 fell into a state of chaos, causing serious losses to state property. The basic construction projects of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, which began in 1950, were all hastily constructed without plans, designs, and insufficient preparation of manpower and materials. This has caused chaos in all aspects of basic construction over the past two years: engineering design errors, changing again and again, resulting in the opposite of the desired result; blindly purchasing materials and a large backlog of funds, and sometimes suspending work waiting for materials; chaotic financial system, funds often misappropriated; lax supervision of contractors during construction, some cadres led by Guo Qiying, Deputy Director of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and Director of the Basic Construction Department, and Li Shuren, Deputy Director of the Basic Construction Department, accepted bribes from private merchants, did not strictly inspect the progress of the project, resulting in serious theft of materials and shoddy engineering quality. The consequences of this chaos are: only 18.1 percent of the state's investment in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant over the past two years has been put into production, and the pressing problem of workers' welfare has not been solved; direct waste in the project, according to partial estimates, is more than 15 billion yuan; materials stored for two years without use are worth 15.1 billion yuan; regular inventory materials are worth more than 40 billion yuan; and foreign payments in 1951 have always been more than 65 billion yuan. These serious losses and waste were all produced under the leadership of Lu Da's erroneous thinking.

    The Central Ministry of Heavy Industry's notice analyzed the nature of Lu Da's mistakes and the reasons for the mistakes. The notice pointed out that Lu Da's guiding ideology for the basic construction of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was to be ambitious and eager for success, to achieve the task by any means, to adopt a liberal attitude towards the decisions of higher authorities, even to violate discipline, to be not vigilant against the erosion of bourgeois ideology, to adopt a bureaucratic attitude towards the corruption of some cadres, and to not pay enough attention to the real difficulties of the working class. Lu Da's mistakes are due to his liberalism, localism and personal heroism. The existence and development of these bad tendencies are inseparable from his purely technical point of view and his tendency not to ask about politics. The leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry has a serious bureaucratic style in dealing with this issue. In October and November 1950, the Ministry of Heavy Industry sent personnel to inspect the work of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant twice. During the inspection, it was found that there were serious errors in the basic construction work of this plant, and some cadres were corrupt. However, these facts did not attract the attention of the leadership of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, so that the errors could develop. Zhong Lin, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, was in charge of the steel industry, but his leadership of the Steel Industry Bureau was only in charge of technology and not policy, only seeking to expand production and construction, regardless of other conditions, thus fueling the development of Lu Da's errors. The notice pointed out that Deputy Minister Zhong Lin should also conduct a strict self-criticism. The notice pointed out that in order to learn from Lu Da's mistakes, it is necessary to strengthen ideological leadership and strictly enforce discipline in the future; and to mobilize the masses to thoroughly inspect the work in this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and expose and handle all illegal and undisciplined behaviors.

    中央重工业部钢铁工业局副局长  陆达违犯财经纪律已被撤职
    他从本位主义出发伪造决算五百多亿元
    中央人民政府重工业部钢铁工业局副局长陆达从本位主义出发违犯财经纪律，伪造太原钢铁厂一九五○年度基本建设决算，虚报工作总量五百零三亿元，使太原钢铁厂的基本建设遭受很大损失。中央重工业部已把陆达撤职，并通报重工业部所属各部门从这一事件中取得教训。
    陆达从本位主义出发的无组织无纪律行为并不是偶然的。一九五○年太原钢铁厂的基本建设任务本来已经一九四九年全国钢铁会议规定并经政务院财政经济委员会批准。但在一九五○年四月，陆达和重工业部副部长钟林竟把太原钢铁厂的基本建设任务擅自修改扩大，同时修改了年度工程计划。改变了和增加了的工程项目还没有经过上级批准，工程预算也还没有做出，陆达就命令太原钢铁厂在五、六月中把全部工程开工。一九五○年十月政务院财政经济委员会批示保留太原钢铁厂最大的修造部的工程项目。陆达竟把政务院财政经济委员会的批示扣压在钢铁工业局，不予执行。九月二十一日，陆达还曾写信给太原钢铁厂，要他们大量购买物料，赶快把一九五○年的基本建设资金用掉。一九五○年十二月三十一日政务院财政经济委员会曾作出指示，明确地规定一九五○年度基本建设未完工程和剩余资金一律交回中央财政部，剩余的材料和定货押金购料款等，由各部代为保管转回财政部，做为转抵一九五一年度投资。一九五一年一月十一日重工业部转发了这个决定，并发出补充指示，令所属各部门执行。但是，陆达竟不执行上级的决定，一九五一年二月二十二日太原钢铁厂的真实决算送局后，他指示钢铁工业局计划部门会同太原钢铁厂基本建设处副处长李树人修改决算，把预付定金、在运材料和暂付款等共五百零三亿元，伪造项目，分摊在工程决算中。这个假决算连太原钢铁厂厂长李非平也不知道，直到一九五一年九月，才被重工业部查出。
    在陆达这种错误思想指导下，太原钢铁厂一九五○年和一九五一年的基本建设陷于混乱状态，并使国家财产遭受严重的损失。从一九五○年开始的太原钢铁厂的基本建设工程都是在缺乏计划、设计，人力物力准备不周的情况下仓促施工的。这就造成了两年来基本建设的各方面的混乱：工程设计错误，一变再变，结果欲速不达；盲目购置材料大量积压资金，有时则又停工待料；财务制度混乱，资金常被挪用；在施工中对包商监督不严，以太原钢铁厂副厂长兼基本建设处处长郭奇应和基本建设处副处长李树人为首的一些干部，接受私商贿赂，对工程进行情况不严加检查，以致发生严重的偷工减料工程质量低劣现象。这种混乱现象的后果是：国家两年来对太原钢铁厂的投资只有百分之十八点一投入生产，迫切需要解决的职工福利问题也没有解决；工程中的直接浪费，据部分估计，就有一百五十多亿元；积存两年不用的材料值一百五十一亿元；经常的库存材料值四百亿元以上；一九五一年外付款始终在六百五十亿元以上。这些严重的损失和浪费都是在陆达的错误思想领导下产生的。
    中央重工业部的通报分析了陆达所犯错误的性质和产生错误的原因。通报指出，陆达对太原钢铁厂基本建设的指导思想是好大喜功，完成任务不择手段，对上级决定采取自由主义态度，甚至破坏纪律，对资产阶级的思想侵蚀不加警惕，对某些干部的贪污腐化行为采取官僚主义态度，对工人阶级的切身困难则不够重视。陆达的这些错误是由于他的自由主义，本位主义和个人英雄主义所造成的，这些不良倾向的存在和发展，和他的单纯技术观点、不问政治倾向是分不开的。重工业部的领导方面对待这个问题有严重的官僚主义作风。一九五零年十月、十一月重工业部曾两次派员检查太原钢铁厂的工作。在检查中已发现这个厂的基本建设工作有严重错误，某些干部有贪污腐化行为。但是，这些事实没有引起重工业部的领导方面的重视，以致使错误得以发展下去。重工业部副部长钟林主管钢铁工业，但他对钢铁工业局的领导是只管技术不管政策，只求生产建设扩大，不管其他条件，因而助长了陆达的错误的发展。通报指出，钟林副部长也应进行严格的检讨。通报指出，接受陆达所犯错误的教训，今后必须加强思想领导，严肃纪律；并在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中发动群众彻底检查工作，揭发检举和处理一切违法乱纪行为。
