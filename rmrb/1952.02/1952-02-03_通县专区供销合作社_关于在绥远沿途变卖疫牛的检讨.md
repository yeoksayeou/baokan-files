    Tongxian Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative
    A Self-Criticism Regarding Selling Diseased Cattle Along the Way in Suiyuan

    To the Editors: The "Reader's Letters" column in the People's Daily on November 20, 1951, published a criticism by Comrades Lou Shukui and Ma Zuiye regarding our cooperative's Zhao Shirong selling diseased cattle along the way in Suiyuan. We sincerely accept this criticism. First of all, we must admit that our leadership over business personnel working outside the district was very inadequate. When Zhao Shirong drove 252 head of cattle from Shanba Town in Suiyuan to Cainaobao, 30 head of cattle were found to be ill. He reported this situation to the cooperative, and at that time, the cooperative only sent a young and inexperienced veterinarian to treat them, but did not instruct them to contact the local people's government and listen to their leadership. Zhao Shirong blindly believed the veterinarian's diagnosis that they were not diseased cattle and sold the diseased cattle along the way. When they reached Shibaital, two cattle died. The village chief of this village advised him not to sell any more. However, Zhao Shirong, on the pretext of fearing losses to the cooperative, did not listen to the advice, but only skinned the dead cattle and buried the meat, which spread the virus and caused losses to the people's property. This not only shows that Zhao Shirong disregarded the interests of the people, but also proves that our cooperative's leadership has a bureaucratic style. Now, in addition to making a public self-criticism, we have also given Zhao Shirong a demerit.

    关于在绥远沿途变卖疫牛的检讨
    编辑同志：一九五一年十一月二十日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了娄树奎、马醉野二同志对我社赵士荣在绥远沿途变卖疫牛的批评，我们诚恳地接受这个批评。首先应该承认，我们对外出业务人员的领导是很不够的。当赵士荣把二百五十二头耕牛从绥远陕坝镇赶到财脑包地方时，就发现三十头牛有病。他回社报告了这种情况，当时社里只派了一个缺乏经验的年青兽医前往治疗，但没有叮嘱他们必须和当地人民政府取得联系，并听从其领导。赵士荣盲目听信兽医诊断，认为不是疫牛，竟把疫牛沿途变卖。到十八台地方时，有两头牛病死，这村村长曾劝告不要再卖。但赵士荣藉口怕使合作社受损失，不听从劝告，只把死牛剥了皮，埋了肉，以致病毒传播，使人民财产受到损失。这不只说明赵士荣不顾人民利益，同时也证明我社领导方面有官僚主义作风。现在我们除作公开检讨外，并给赵士荣以记过处分。
