    The Achievements of the Datong Coal Mine No. 6 Well in Implementing the Circular Production Schedule System
    Zhang Yi
    In the patriotic production increase and economy campaign, the state-owned Datong Coal Mine No. 6 Well implemented a circular production schedule system, which closely coordinated the various parts of the mine and greatly improved production efficiency.

    The circular production schedule system is an advanced Soviet industrial production management method. It can ensure the highly rational use of labor and machinery, concretely implement the production plan throughout the entire production process, and allow work to proceed at a uniform pace every hour and even every minute. In mechanized new coal mining method mines, because workers and machinery are in a highly mobile state, ensuring that production proceeds strictly according to plan is a prerequisite for maximizing labor and machinery efficiency. The circular production schedule system is a progressive system that guarantees production proceeds strictly according to plan.

    Before implementing the circular production schedule system, although the Datong Coal Mine No. 6 Well had implemented mechanized coal mining methods for more than a year, there were still many chaotic phenomena in production. For example, when encountering rock inclusions and floor stone during stoping, no one wanted to remove them, so the working face was not straight, the coal chute could not be moved close, and two or three shoveling procedures were wasted. In order to produce more coal in their own shift, workers did not prepare for continuous production for the next shift, so the next shift could work for only six hours at most after starting work. Furthermore, transportation did not coordinate with tunneling and stoping. Some places produced a lot of coal, but the mine cars were not supplied, while other places had dozens of empty cars; the mine car turnover was very slow.

    Since the organization of work according to the circular production schedule, this situation has fundamentally changed. The circular production schedule fixes the place and time of production for each miner and strictly specifies the work sequence. For example, the working face of the 801 stoping area is 102 meters long and is divided into six sections. The coal cutting machine operators, electric drill operators, and loading workers working in this stoping area all carry out coal cutting, drilling, and loading work according to the sections and times specified in the chart. Production is continuous, and no one interferes with anyone else. Before handing over shifts, the previous shift leaves two sections of coal pillars for the next shift according to the chart and drills one section of blast holes for them, so the next shift can continue production as soon as they take over, without wasting any time.

    After the implementation of the circular production schedule system, the entire production process has a definite record, so problems in production can be discovered and resolved in a timely manner. For example, on November 15th of last year, because the chart of transportation work indicated that the mine car turnaround time had been extended, the production management personnel conducted an inspection and discovered a mine car derailment accident on the East No. 1 main haulage way and resolved it immediately. Furthermore, on November 20th of last year, they found that the East No. 1 main haulage way had another mine car derailment accident from the transportation chart, found the problem of rotten sleepers and loose spikes, and immediately repaired them, so that the next train of mine cars could run as usual.

    Working according to the day and night circular production schedule system has raised the coal mining industry to a higher stage of scientific production. This progressive labor production organization guarantees the highly utilization of all the abundant technology in the mine, which creates tremendous possibilities for improving coal mining production efficiency. From July 2nd to December 15th of last year, the average coal production efficiency per employee in the No. 6 Well increased to 1.9423 tons, an increase of 63.21% compared to the first half of last year. A 63-horsepower coal cutting machine used to cut a maximum of 50 meters of coal pillars, but now it cuts 102 meters. The average mine car turnover rate per shift underground is now 5.1 times, an increase of 83.5% compared to the past. The time for the production process, from loading coal from the stoping face into the electric chute, through various transportation methods above and below ground for 3,100 meters, to transporting the coal to the coal bunker, has been greatly shortened, and it only took 29 minutes and 47 seconds in the first half of December last year. Because production efficiency has increased, the cost of coal has been greatly reduced. The cost of coal per ton in the No. 6 Well's working face in November last year decreased by 43.5% compared to June. Organizing work according to the charts has also promoted the increase of miners' wages. The average wage per worker in the No. 6 Well in November last year increased by 61.5% compared to January. After Chairman Mao put forward the call for increasing production and practicing economy, the employees of the Datong Coal Mine responded enthusiastically. The No. 6 Well successively created new coal production records. In the first half of December last year, the average coal production efficiency per employee increased to 2.0748 tons, creating a new national coal mine wellhead coal production efficiency record.

    The successful implementation of the production schedule system in the Datong Coal Mine No. 6 Well was achieved after overcoming the complacency of leading cadres, purely technical viewpoints, and the conservative ideas of some workers.

    As early as July 1950, after the successful implementation of the mechanized new coal mining method in the 802 stoping area of the No. 6 Well, the leading cadres of the Mining Bureau proposed to try the circular production schedule operation method. However, at that time, the leading cadres had serious non-political tendencies. Because the successful implementation of the mechanized new coal mining method greatly boosted the morale of the workers, and the production efficiency of the entire mine increased by 1.24 times compared to the old coal mining method, and the cost decreased by 32.86%, they felt that the Datong Coal Mine was already "complete." They believed that implementing the production schedule operation method was a matter for technicians and that it could be implemented without ideological education of the workers. For example, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party organization, trade union, and Communist Youth League in the Second Mine heard about the trial implementation of the "chart system" and no one understood what it was for, so they did not actively lead this work. The technicians hung a large "exquisite" chart on the gable wall of the underground office and recorded the production situation of each shift on the chart with various symbols. The underground grassroots cadres and workers did not know what this "new trick" was, and they were confused and thought it had nothing to do with them, and they were unwilling to even look at it. After the coal in the 802 stoping area was "eaten" up, someone rolled up this chart and locked it in a drawer as "waste."

    This failed lesson was repeated once again in December 1950.

    The complacency and purely technical viewpoints of the leading cadres were not severely criticized until the Second National Coal Mine Conference in April last year. They began to realize that adopting the new coal mining method was only the beginning of a comprehensive reform of coal mine production; only by doing a good job in roof management on the basis of adopting the new coal mining method, ensuring the safe operation of machinery, and then using the circular production schedule system to manage and guide production, can the comprehensive reform of coal mine production be completed.

    On the basis of this new understanding, the leading cadres first summarized the lessons of the previous two failures, discovered the ideological roots of the separation of technology from politics and the failure to educate and rely on the masses of workers, and then found ways to improve. After "Red May," a widespread and systematic ideological mobilization was carried out in the Second Mine. Through training classes, study meetings, and other forms, the Second Mine's Party organization, administration, trade union, Communist Youth League cadres, as well as engineering and technical personnel, and grassroots cadres above the No. 6 Well group leader level, were organized to study for more than a month. Before the key trial implementation in the 807 stoping area, a meeting of group leaders, representatives of various types of work, and model workers was convened to discuss and revise the planned chart, so that it was more practical. The trade union and the administration signed a collective contract, stipulating the conditions for mutual guarantee. The trade union and Communist Youth League organizations of the No. 6 Well, under the leadership of the Party committee, carried out solidarity and education work among the miners. At that time, there was relatively stubborn conservative thinking among the miners. They were accustomed to the old production methods: they mined where the coal was easy to mine, they did not care about the next shift, and there was no coordination and connection between them. When everyone was promoting the trial implementation of the "chart system," the miners did not say it openly, but they generally muttered behind their backs: "The 'old rules' cannot be changed, no matter how much you make trouble, it won't work!" When the trial implementation began on July 2nd last year, the coal miners of the early and middle shifts were all clamoring, especially Liu Fu, the deputy group leader of the middle shift, who clamored the most fiercely: "What is this 'chart system,' it's simply a 'control system'!" No one was willing to prepare for continuous production for the next shift 30 minutes in advance, and they all wanted their own shift to produce more coal. Under the patient education of Song Baoming, the senior group leader, the coal miners of the early shift could prepare for the next shift, but the middle shift followed the "old habits" and often took advantage of the early shift. The coal miners of the early shift were dissatisfied with the coal miners of the middle shift and complained to the leadership: "The 'chart system' has 'controlled' us, and the coal we produce is recorded in other people's accounts, it's not as good as before!"

    In order to overcome the conservative thinking of the employees, the trade union launched a revision of the patriotic covenant movement, and through this movement, combined with the trial implementation of chart work, carried out a political education on current events for the miners, which universally improved the awareness of the masses of workers. The relatively conservative Liu Fu said at the group meeting: "The Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting in Korea, and they can't even get enough to eat every few days, but they can still eliminate the American devils by the thousands and tens of thousands. We are the leading class of the country, and we should not lag behind in production at all. We guarantee the success of the trial implementation no matter how difficult it is." After the patriotic covenant was revised, the trade union put forward the slogan "Producing one more ton of coal is equivalent to increasing the strength of resistance against the United States and aid to Korea." Through this patriotic movement, the conservative thinking of the miners was quickly overcome. They accepted the advanced production experience - the circular production schedule system.

    Since the miners consciously mastered the charts, they highly developed their initiative and creativity. They put forward a large number of rationalization proposals, and revised the planned charts again and again, making them charts that closely integrate theory and practice, and scientifically organize and guide labor production.

    大同煤矿六号井实行循环生产时间图表制的成果
    张毅
    国营大同煤矿六号井在爱国增产节约运动中，实行循环生产时间图表制，使矿井中各部分严密地配合起来，大大地提高了生产效率。
    循环生产时间表工作制，是苏联先进的工业生产管理方法，它可以保证高度合理化地使用劳动力和机械设备，把生产计划具体地贯串在全部生产过程中，使每一小时以至每一分钟的工作，都能按着均匀的节奏进行。在实行了机械化新采煤法的矿井里面，由于工人和机械设备都在高度移动的状况中，保证生产严格地按计划进行，就成为发挥劳动力和机械效能的必备条件。循环生产时间表工作制就是保证生产严格地按计划进行的一种进步的制度。
    大同煤矿六号井在实行循环生产时间表工作制之先，虽已实行机械化采煤方法一年多，但在生产上仍然有不少紊乱现象。如在回采时遇到夹石和铺底石，谁也不愿清除，因此工作面拉不直，煤溜子移不近，浪费了两三道攉煤的手续。工人为了本班多出煤，上班不给下班做好连续生产的准备工作，以致下班上工后顶多能工作六个小时。又如运搬配合不上掘进和回采，有的地方出煤多，车皮供应不上，有的地方放着几十辆空车；车皮周转得很慢。
    自从按照循环生产时间表组织工作后，这种情况就根本改变了。循环生产时间表把每个矿工生产的地方和时间全都固定起来，并严格地规定了工作序列。如八○一回采区的工作面共长一百零二公尺，分作六段。在这个回采区工作的割煤机手、电钻工和装车工，都各自按照图表中所规定的工段和时间进行割煤、打眼和装煤工作。连续生产，谁也不妨碍谁。在交班前，上一班按照图表规定，为下一班留下两段煤根，并为他们打好一段炮眼，因此下班回采工一接班，就能连续生产，一点也不耽误时间。
    实行循环生产时间表工作制以后，全部生产过程都有了确实的纪录，因此可以及时发现生产中存在的问题，并及时解决。如在去年十一月十五日由于运搬工作的纪录图表上标示出煤车运转时间延长了，生产管理人员就进行检查，发现了在东一马机道的煤车落道事故，并立即解决。又如去年十一月二十日他们因从运搬图表中发现东一马机道再次发生煤车落道事故，找出了枕木腐朽、道钉活动的毛病，当即予以整修，使下一列煤车照常运行。
    按照昼夜的循环生产时间图表制进行工作，把煤矿工业提高到了更高的科学的生产阶段。这种进步的劳动生产组织，保证高度利用矿井中所有的丰富技术，它为提高采煤生产效率造成了巨大的可能。六号井从去年七月二日起到十二月十五日止，全员平均产煤效率提高到一点九四二三吨，比去年前半年的产量提高了百分之六十三点二一。一台六十三马力割煤机过去顶多割到五十公尺煤根，现在割到一百零二公尺。井下每班煤车周转率现在平均是五点一次，比过去提高了百分之八十三点五。从回采工作面往电溜子里装煤起，经过三千一百公尺长的井上井下的各种运搬，到把煤运到煤仓止，这个生产过程的时间大大缩短了，去年十二月上半月有二十九分四十七秒钟就够了。因为生产效率提高，煤的成本费用大大降低了。六号井去年十一月份的工作面吨煤成本，比六月份的降低了百分之四十三点五。按照图表组织工作，也促进了矿工工资的增加。六号井去年十一月份的每工平均工资，比一月份的增加了百分之六十一点五。毛主席提出增产节约的号召以后，大同煤矿职工热烈响应。六号井接二连三地创造了产煤新纪录。去年十二月上半月，全员平均产煤效率提高到二点零七四八吨，创造了全国煤矿井口全员产煤效率新纪录。
          ×　×　×
    大同煤矿六号井实行生产时间图表制，是克服了领导干部的自满情绪、单纯技术观点和部分工人的保守思想以后才成功的。
    远在一九五○年七月间，六号井八○二回采区实行机械化新法采煤方法成功以后，矿务局领导干部就提出试行循环生产时间图表作业方法。可是，那时候领导干部的思想有着严重的非政治化倾向。因为实行了机械化新采煤方法成功以后，工人情绪很高，全矿生产效率比用旧采煤方法时提高了一点二四倍，成本降低了百分之三二点八六，所以他们便觉得大同煤矿已经“完整无缺”了。他们认为实行生产时间图表作业方法是技术人员的事情，认为不要对工人进行思想教育就可以行得通。如二矿的中国共产党组织、工会、青年团领导干部听说试行“图表制”，谁都弄不清楚它管什么用，因此也就没有积极领导这项工作。技术员把一大张“精致”的图表挂在井下办公室的山墙上，把每班生产情况用各种符号记录在图上。井下基层干部和工人不知道这是闹什么“新花招”，稀里糊涂搞不清，认为跟自己没关系，连看都不愿意看。八○二回采区的煤“吃”完了以后，不知道是谁，把这张图表卷起来，当作“废物”锁在抽屉里了。
    这个失败的教训，在一九五○年十二月的时候又重复了一次。
    领导干部的自满情绪和单纯技术观点，直到去年四月在第二届全国煤矿会议上才受到严厉的批判。他们开始认识了采用新采煤方法，仅仅是煤矿生产全面改革的开端；只有在采用新采煤方法的基础上做好顶板管理，保证机械安全运转，从而用循环生产时间图表制管理和指导生产，才算完成煤矿生产的全面改革。
    在新的认识的基础上，领导干部首先总结了前两次失败的教训，发现了技术脱离政治、没有教育和依靠工人群众的错误思想根源，从而找出了改进的办法。“红五月”以后，在二矿进行了普遍的系统的打通思想工作。通过训练班、学习会等形式，组织二矿党组织、行政、工会、青年团干部以及工程技术人员、六号井小组长以上的基层干部进行了学习，前后一共一个多月。在八○七回采区重点试行之先，召开了大小组长、各工种代表、劳动模范会议，讨论和修正了计划图表，使它比较切合实际，工会与行政订了集体合同，规定了互相保证的条件。六号井工会和青年团的组织，在党委领导下，对矿工进行了团结和教育工作。当时在矿工中有比较顽强的保守思想。他们习惯于旧的生产方法：那里的煤好采就往那里采，上班不管下班，互相没有配合和联系。在到处都在宣传试行“图表制”的时候，矿工们明里不说，背地里却普遍地嘀咕：“‘老规矩’不能改，咋闹腾也不管用！”去年七月二日开始试行，早、中班的回采矿工都在吵嚷，特别是中班副组长刘富吵得最凶：“这是什么‘图表制’，简直是‘治人制’！”谁也不愿意提前三十分钟给下班做好连续生产的准备工作，都想自己的班多出煤。早班回采工在大组长宋宝明耐心的教育下，能给下班做好准备工作，可是中班按“老习惯”办事，常占早班的便宜。早班回采工对中班回采工不满意，向领导方面提出：“‘图表制’算是把我们‘治’了，我们出的煤记在人家的账上，还不如从前好！”
    为了克服职工的保守思想，工会发动了一个修订爱国公约运动，通过这个运动结合试行图表工作向矿工进行了一次时事政治教育，普遍提高了工人群众的觉悟。比较保守的刘富在小组会上说：“中国人民志愿军在朝鲜打仗，三天两头吃不上饭，还能成千上万地消灭美国鬼子，咱们是国家的领导阶级，生产上一点也不应当落后，有天大的困难也保证试行成功。”修订爱国公约以后，工会又提出“多出一吨煤，就等于多增加一分抗美援朝力量”的口号。经过这个爱国运动，迅速地克服了矿工们的保守思想。接受了先进的生产经验——循环生产时间图表制。
    自从矿工们自觉地掌握了图表以后，高度发挥了积极性和创造性。他们提出大量的合理化建议，把计划图表一再修正，使它成为理论和实践密切结合的、科学的组织和指导劳动生产的图表了。
