    Former Taiyuan Railway Bureau Leadership Should Investigate Phenomena of Misappropriation of Funds
    The former Taiyuan Railway Bureau leadership illegally used funds earmarked for building houses and bunkers for public security personnel along the railway lines. In December 1950, the Ministry of Railways allocated 7 million catties of millet to the former Taiyuan Railway Bureau's Public Security Department for constructing houses and bunkers for public security personnel along the railway lines. After this sum was allocated, the bureau's finance department misappropriated 1.3 million catties of millet to purchase tools for the engineering team. As the end of 1950 approached, to avoid the regulation of returning surplus funds, the finance department urged the Public Security Department to quickly purchase construction materials. After "research" by Wang Xiaobin, Deputy Director of the Bureau, Lang Taonan, Director of the Secretariat, Wen Zongxue, Director of the Public Security Department, and Fu Shaoqing, Director of the Finance Department, two large buildings, senior cadre dormitories, and five or six solitary confinement rooms were built for the Public Security Department. Secondly, more than 1 million catties of millet were withdrawn to build a large auditorium for the Bureau; and a false final account was made to report to the Ministry of Railways. In fact, it is still unclear how much was actually used and how much remains. It is understood that some houses were also built for the relevant public security personnel along the railway lines, costing more than 1.6 million catties of millet. However, the public security comrades along the lines still feel that the housing is insufficient. Comrades have many opinions on this phenomenon of misappropriation of funds. In addition, the phenomenon of waste within the former Taiyuan Railway Bureau was also very serious. When building dormitories at the racecourse east of Taiyuan North Station, construction was once suspended due to poor planning, resulting in waste. When building the railway hospital at Dadongmen in Taiyuan, the compacted earth was dug up again to install water pipes after it was built. A rockery was built in front of this hospital, costing 300,000 catties of millet. Workers said, "There are so many mountains in Taiyuan, we are tired of seeing them. It's useless to build a mountain in front of the hospital!"
    Recently, when I went to Taiyuan on business, many comrades from the Taiyuan Railway Sub-bureau raised many opinions about the above situations and requested the relevant leaders to conduct a thorough investigation.

    前太原铁路管理局领导方面  
    应该检查专款不专用的现象
    前太原铁路管理局领导方面非法动用有关铁路沿线公安人员盖房子和筑碉堡的款项。一九五零年十二月铁道部拨给前太原铁路管理局公安处建筑沿线公安人员用的房子和碉堡的款项七百万斤小米。这笔款拨到后，管理局财务处挪用一百三十万斤小米给工程队买了工具。快到一九五零年年底结账的时候了，为了逃避余款上缴的规定，财务处才督促公安处赶快购买建筑材料。经过管理局副局长王效斌、秘书主任郎涛南和公安处处长温宗学、财务处处长傅少情等的“研究”后，给公安处盖了两所大楼、高级干部宿舍和五、六间禁闭室。其次，又提了一百多万斤小米为管理局盖了大礼堂；并且造了假的决算向铁道部报了账。其实，到底用了多少，还剩多少，现在也还弄不清。据了解，给有关铁路沿线公安人员也盖了一部分房子，用费是一百六十万多斤小米。但是，沿线的公安同志们还是感到房子不够用。对这种专款不专用的现象，同志们意见很多。另外，前太原铁路管理局内的浪费现象也很严重。在太原北站东边的赛马场盖宿舍时，由于计划不周，曾经停工待料，造成浪费。在太原大东门盖铁路医院时，盖好后又把三合土地刨开再安装水管。在这个医院门前，还用三十万斤小米修了一座假山。职工们说：“太原有多少山，都看厌了。医院门前还修山，真没用！”
    最近，我因事到太原，太原铁路分局的许多同志们又对上面那些情况提了很多意见，并请求有关领导方面好好检查。
