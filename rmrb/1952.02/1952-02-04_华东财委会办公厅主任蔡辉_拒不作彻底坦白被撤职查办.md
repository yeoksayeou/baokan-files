    Cai Hui, Director of the General Office of the East China Financial and Economic Committee,
    Dismissed and Investigated for Refusing to Make a Thorough Confession
    [Our Newspaper] Cai Hui, Director of the General Office of the East China Financial and Economic Committee and concurrently Director of the Enterprise Management Office of the organization, engaged in illegal activities such as abusing cadres, engaging in private interests under the guise of public service, and speculating in Hong Kong currency exchange rates, and private lending; he refused to make a thorough confession in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.  East China Financial and Economic Committee Director Zeng Shan has reported this to East China Military and Political Committee Chairman Rao Shushi, and Cai Hui has been dismissed and investigated. He has been strictly ordered to continue to confess and self-criticize, and a final decision will be made based on the degree of his confession and repentance.
    Before the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the leaders of the Financial and Economic Committee had already noticed Cai Hui's situation and designated the organization's enterprises under Cai Hui's responsibility as key points for inspection. During the movement, the major corruption cases of Xu Zaocai and Chen Rongfu, staff members of the Enterprise Management Office, were discovered. Xu Zaocai was brought into the organization through Cai Hui's personal connections, and Chen Rongfu was taken over from the original staff when the Maoxin Yarn Factory was acquired. At the time, Cai Hui appointed these people without going through organizational procedures or inquiring about their past history, unconditionally trusting them, and allowing Xu Zaocai to exclusively manage major powers such as factory management and procurement. In the past, some comrades had reported to Cai Hui that Xu Zaocai had a bad reputation in his hometown, had served as a puppet tax collector, and made a fortune. Cai Hui neither reported this to higher authorities nor was he alerted, but instead entrusted Xu Zaocai with 52 million yuan of his father-in-law and grandfather's money for private lending, earning a high interest of more than 13.61 million yuan in about ten months. This was a conscious and planned illegal act of seeking exorbitant profits for the benefit of his family and personal enjoyment, at the expense of violating national laws and decrees. In the summer of 1950, Cai Hui also helped private merchants speculate in 10,000 Hong Kong dollars, which was also a violation of the law.
    For more than ten years in the past, Cai Hui had been engaged in trade work in the liberated areas. In his business dealings, he often used relatives and friends, progressing from blurring the lines between public and private to engaging in private interests under the guise of public service. After entering the city, Cai Hui did not draw a clear class line with the merchants he had dealt with in the past, and accepted many bribes and gifts. In his third self-criticism report, he had to admit: "Over the past ten years, the number of gifts I have received is difficult to recall, and private interests under the guise of public service have caused losses to state property."
    Since the large-scale launch of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in various organs in East China, the leaders of the East China Financial and Economic Committee designated Cai Hui to make self-criticisms both inside and outside the Party, but he had been unclear in his understanding of his mistakes. Although he had made three self-criticisms at the East China Financial and Economic Committee Party branch meeting, the East China Military and Political Committee directly affiliated organ Party representative meeting, and the East China Financial and Economic Committee cadre meeting, and had undergone sincere enlightenment and education from many comrades inside and outside the Party, he repeatedly delayed and failed to make a thorough confession and deep self-criticism.
    Because the mistakes committed by Cai Hui are extremely serious, East China Financial and Economic Committee Director Zeng Shan has reported to Chairman Rao Shushi and approved Cai Hui's dismissal and investigation, ordering him to continue to conduct a thorough self-criticism.
    On February 3rd, in this newspaper's first edition, in the article "Central Ministry of Trade Affiliated Units Arrest Fourteen Major Corrupt Elements in Ten Days," "Zhang Hao Lie" should read "Zhang Hong Lie."

    华东财委会办公厅主任蔡辉  
    拒不作彻底坦白被撤职查办
    【本报讯】华东财政经济委员会办公厅主任兼机关企业管理处处长蔡辉，有滥用干部、假公济私及套用港汇、私营拆放等违法行为；在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中拒不作彻底坦白，业经华东财政经济委员会曾山主任呈准华东军政委员会饶漱石主席，将蔡辉撤职查办，严令继续坦白检讨，并视其坦白与悔改的程度，再作最后处理。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动前，财委领导方面已对蔡辉的情况引起注意，并将蔡辉所负责的机关企业作为重点，进行检查。运动中，发现了机关企业管理处职员徐造才、陈荣福的大贪污案，徐造才是经蔡辉私人关系拉进机关的，陈荣福是从收购懋新纱厂时原班接收过来的。当时蔡辉任用这些人，既不经过组织手续，也不问清过去历史，即无条件加以信任，并让徐造才独掌盘厂、采购等大权。过去曾有同志向蔡辉反映过，徐造才在家乡有劣迹，当过伪税收员，发过横财等。蔡辉既未向上级报告，更未引起警惕，反把自己岳父和祖父的钱五千二百万元，委托徐造才私营拆放，十个月左右获高利达一千三百六十一万余元。这是他为了家庭利益和个人享受有意识有计划地贪图暴利、不惜破坏国家法令的违法行为。蔡辉于一九五○年夏又曾帮助私商套用港币一万元，这也是违反法令的。
    蔡辉在过去十多年间，一直在解放区做贸易工作，在业务上往往利用亲戚朋友，由公私不分发展到假公济私。入城以后，蔡辉没有与过去来往的商人划清阶级界线，受贿受礼甚多。他在第三次检讨报告中也不得不承认：“十余年来，受礼之多，已难尽忆，假公济私，因而使国家财产遭受损失。”
    自华东各机关大张旗鼓地展开了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动后，华东财政经济委员会领导上即指定蔡辉在党内外作检讨，但他对自己的错误一直认识不清。他虽然在华东财政经济委员会党支部大会、华东军政委员会直属机关党代表会议、华东财政经济委员会干部大会上作过三次检讨，又经过党内外许多同志诚恳的启发与教育，但他仍然一再拖延，不彻底坦白作深刻检讨。
    由于蔡辉所犯的错误是极端严重的，因此华东财政经济委员会曾山主任已呈准饶漱石主席，予蔡辉撤职查办，令其继续进行彻底检讨。
