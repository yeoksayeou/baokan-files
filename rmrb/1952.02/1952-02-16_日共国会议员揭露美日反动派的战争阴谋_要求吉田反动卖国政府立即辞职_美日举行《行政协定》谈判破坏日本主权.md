Xinhua News Agency, February 15th, Tokyo Dispatch: To safeguard the true interests of the Japanese people, Japanese Communist Party congressmen are exposing the policies pursued by the Yoshida government and the American authorities, which are turning Japan into a military colony of US imperialism, and demanding the immediate resignation of the Yoshida government.

　　Communist Congressman Sakujiro Nashiki, when questioning the plenary session of the House of Representatives on January 25, said: As a result of the Yoshida government accepting the separate Peace Treaty and the US-Japan Military Agreement (Security Treaty) regardless of the people's desire for peace and independence, Japan is now expanding its armaments, US troops are stationed in Japan, the US and Japan are cooperating for war, and trade with China is prohibited. Nashiki exposed the plans of the US occupying authorities and the Japanese government for expanding armaments and preparing for war, and emphasized the disastrous consequences caused by the war policy.

　　Nashiki detailed the aggressive nature of post-war American foreign policy, saying: The Yoshida government's policy of obstructing Japanese trade with China, under the direction of the United States, exposes its own nature of opposing national interests. Nashiki said: The Security Treaty and the Administrative Agreement "are closely linked to the Korean War policy implemented by the United States under the banner of the United Nations."

　　Nashiki exposed the government's propaganda that only an alliance with the United States can guarantee Japan's security, and emphasized: "If we truly hope for peace, then we have no other path than to resolutely break away from the war camp and join the powerful peace camp. Concluding the Five-Power Peace Pact proposed by the World Peace Council is the foundation for guaranteeing world peace and international security. Rejecting the separate Peace Treaty and the Security Treaty and concluding a comprehensive peace treaty with the participation of the Soviet Union and China is the only way to guarantee Japan's security and give it independence and freedom." After describing the situation of the US-Japan authorities trampling on the freedom of the people and persecuting Japanese patriots, Nashiki said: The Japanese nation is groaning under the rule of the occupying authorities and the Yoshida government. We demand that the reactionary government that advocates war and betrays the nation—the Yoshida government—resign immediately.

　　Xinhua News Agency, February 15th, Tokyo News: The negotiations between the US and Japanese governments on the Administrative Agreement are continuing in Tokyo. Under the manipulation of US representative Rusk in the negotiations, the US and Japan have reached agreements on many matters that violently undermine Japan's independence and sovereignty. According to the Tokyo Shimbun, one of the agreements is: "US military personnel will not be bound by Japanese law when entering and leaving Japanese territory. Ships, vehicles, and aircraft of (US) stationed troops and military personnel can freely use the equipment and facilities of Japanese ports and airports." In this way, Japan is in fact a colony under US military occupation.

　　Not only that, but the privileges of the US military stationed in Japan as stipulated in the Administrative Agreement after the separate peace treaty takes effect are meticulous, and these privileges thoroughly undermine Japanese sovereignty. According to Kyodo News, according to the agreement between the US and Japan, the US military stationed in Japan can not only use "military scrip" and issue driver's licenses, but even operate "retail stores, clubs, theaters and other entertainment facilities for the garrison."

　　In order to cover up the shameful truth that the United States is turning Japan into a US military base through the Administrative Agreement, the US and Japanese reactionaries are conspiring to keep the specific provisions regarding important matters such as military bases and stationed troops as secret clauses, and will not announce them under the pretext of "military secrets." According to Kyodo News, "government sources" revealed that the regulations regarding US military bases and exercise grounds "will be formulated as an appendix to the administrative agreement," and this appendix will be "separated" from the text of the Administrative Agreement. At the same time, the agreements reached in this negotiation regarding the "number of troops stationed and the nature of the army" of the US occupying forces will also be kept secret.

　　日共国会议员揭露美日反动派的战争阴谋
    要求吉田反动卖国政府立即辞职
    美日举行《行政协定》谈判破坏日本主权
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社东京讯：日本共产党议员为了保卫日本人民的真正利益，揭露正在把日本变成美帝国主义的军事殖民地的吉田政府和美国当局所奉行的政策，并要求吉田政府立即辞职。
    共产党众议员梨木作次郎一月二十五日在众院全体会议上提出质询时说：由于吉田政府不顾人民渴望和平与独立的意志接受单独《和约》和美日军事协定（《安全条约》）的结果，日本现正扩充军备，美国军队驻留日本，美日两国为了战争而合作，对中国的贸易遭到禁止。梨木揭露美国占领当局和日本政府为了扩充军备和准备战争的计划，并着重指出了战争政策所造成的恶果。
    梨木详细刻划战后美国外交政策的侵略性质，他说：吉田政府根据美国的指使阻碍日本对中国的贸易的政策，暴露出它自己的反对民族利益的性质。梨木说：《安全条约》和《行政协定》，“是和美国在联合国的旗帜下实行的朝鲜战争政策紧密地联系着的”。
    梨木揭露政府说什么只有和美国联盟才可以保证日本的安全这种宣传，并着重指出：“如果我们真正希望和平，那么我们就没有别的道路，只有坚决和战争阵营断绝关系，加入强大的和平阵营。缔结世界和平理事会所建议的五大国和平公约，是保证世界和平与国际安全的基础。拒绝单独《和约》和《安全条约》而缔结有苏联和中国参加的全面和约，便是保证日本安全，给它以独立自由的唯一途径。”梨木在叙述美日当局蹂躏人民的自由和日本爱国者遭受迫害的情形后说：日本民族正在占领当局和吉田政府的统治下呻吟。我们要求主张战争和出卖民族的反动政府——吉田政府立即辞职。
    【新华社十五日讯】东京消息：美日两国政府关于《行政协定》的谈判，正在东京继续举行。在美国代表鲁斯克操纵谈判的情况下，美日双方已在许多横暴破坏日本独立和主权的事项上，达成协议。据《东京新闻》透露，协议之一是：“美国军事人员在出入日本国境时，将不受日本法律的约束。（美国）驻军和军事人员的船只、车辆和飞机可以自由使用日本港口和飞机场的装备和设备。”这样，日本事实上成了美国军事占领下的殖民地。
    不仅如此，《行政协定》所规定的驻日美军在单独和约生效后的特权是无微不至的，这些特权彻底地破坏了日本的主权。据共同社透露，根据美日双方的协议，驻日美军不仅能够使用“军用钞票”、发给汽车驾驶证，甚至能够经营“零售店、俱乐部、剧场等驻军娱乐设施”。
    为了掩盖美国通过《行政协定》把日本变为美国军事基地的可耻的真相，美、日反动派正阴谋把有关军事基地、驻军等重要事项的具体规定作为秘密条款，借口“军事机密”，不予公布。据共同社讯，“政府人士”透露，有关美国军事基地和演习场地等规定，“将作为行政协定的附表而制订”，这个附表和《行政协定》的本文“脱离”。同时，在这次谈判中获得协议的有关美国占领军的“留驻兵力数目和军队的性质”，也将秘不公布。
