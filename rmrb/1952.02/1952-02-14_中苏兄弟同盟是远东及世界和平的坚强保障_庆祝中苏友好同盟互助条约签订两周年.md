    The Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance is a Firm Guarantee of Peace in the Far East and the World
    -- Celebrating the Second Anniversary of the Signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Aid
    Today marks the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Brotherly Alliance between the governments and peoples of China and the Soviet Union. This great alliance between China and the Soviet Union is permanent, unbreakable, and no one can separate it; it is a powerful and invincible alliance. This alliance has particularly significant importance for peace and security in the Far East and Asia. This is because the impact of the Russian Revolution and the Chinese Revolution on modern world politics is extremely enormous. The Russian Revolution was a victorious socialist revolution led by the Russian proletariat and its vanguard – the Bolshevik Party; the Chinese Revolution was a victorious people's democratic revolution led by the Chinese proletariat and its vanguard – the Chinese Communist Party. The Sino-Soviet alliance established by the people of China and the Soviet Union on the basis of revolutionary victory is the backbone of the international united front fighting against the common enemy – imperialism – by combining the socialist revolution led by the proletariat with the people's democratic revolution of the oppressed nations led by the proletariat. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet alliance is not only a beacon guiding the Chinese people to consolidate the victory of the revolution, but also a beacon guiding the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries all over the world, especially the people of Asia, to strive for revolutionary victory.
    Looking back, what kind of world was it before the October Revolution? It was a world completely ruled by capitalism, a most tragic and darkest world. In that world, since the vanguard of Portuguese commercial capitalism, led by a navigator named Gama, sailed around the so-called "Cape of Good Hope" and rushed into the Indian Ocean in 1497, the ancient Asian countries had successively become colonies and semi-colonies for hundreds of years. The people of Asian countries, after various stages of foreign economic, political, and armed aggression by European and American commercial capitalism, industrial capitalism, and financial capitalism, lost their independence and freedom, lost their homes and food, and finally became slaves of imperialism. In that world, although the people of Asian countries had long begun their heroic struggles against imperialism and the ruling classes of various countries colluding with imperialism, they were never able to break through the encirclement of imperialism, and even failed to find a revolutionary road to break through the encirclement. It was in this tragic and dark era that the guns of the October Revolution sounded. The Russian people were the first to break through the world completely ruled by capitalism, and the first to break through the tragic and dark era. People all over the world raised their hands to welcome the Soviet Union. The people of all Asia raised their hands to welcome the Soviet Union. We Chinese people also raised our hands to welcome the Soviet Union, and through the introduction of the Soviet Union, we accepted the revolutionary weapon of Marxism-Leninism with our own hands. Then, under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of our Chinese people, we combined the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution, and after more than 30 years of heroic struggle, we won the victory of the Chinese revolution, established the People's Republic of China, and established a social system of people's democratic dictatorship that is fundamentally different from the capitalist system and far superior to capitalism. Due to the victory of the Chinese revolution, we Chinese people have thoroughly proved the truth of Marxism-Leninism to the people of all colonial and semi-colonial oppressed nations in the world, that is, the people of all colonial and semi-colonial oppressed nations in the world, especially the people of Asia, in the great struggle against imperialist aggression and for independence, peace, and democracy, can only achieve victory by first uniting around the proletariat and its political parties in various countries, uniting around the proletariat of the world, and uniting around the anti-imperialist democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    In the past two years, based on the Sino-Soviet alliance, the government and people of our People's Republic of China have faithfully cooperated with the Soviet government and people, participated in all major international activities to safeguard world peace and security, especially to safeguard peace and security in Asia, and have fully contributed our strength to this end. Here, we must first mention the resolute struggle waged by the governments and peoples of China and the Soviet Union against the unilateral peace treaty with Japan signed by the US imperialists and their vassal states and puppets, and against the US-Japan bilateral security treaty. The purpose of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance is primarily to "jointly prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression of Japan or any other country that may unite with Japan, directly or indirectly, in acts of aggression." However, as a result of the unilateral peace treaty with Japan concluded at the San Francisco Conference manipulated by the United States, the remaining group of Japanese imperialists headed by Yoshida has completely colluded with US imperialism. This collusion is bringing boundless disasters to the Japanese people; for our country and other Asian countries, it will bring the threat of new wars of aggression. Everyone knows that before the end of World War II, Japan was the only country in the entire Asia that had not been reduced to a colony or semi-colony in the era of capitalist aggression. The Japanese people suffered from the oppression of their own bourgeoisie, but they had not yet suffered from the oppression of foreign bourgeoisie; however, today's Japan is actually under the armed occupation of US imperialism and is increasingly moving towards colonization. The Japanese people are now suffering from the double oppression of not only their own bourgeoisie but also foreign bourgeoisie. Under this new situation, the Sino-Soviet alliance must not only stop the conspiracy of the remaining group of Japanese imperialists and American imperialism to collude, revive Japanese militarism, and prepare for new wars of aggression, but it must also support the just struggle of the Japanese people against the military occupation of US imperialism and for independence, peace, and democracy. We Chinese people have a long-standing feud with Japanese imperialism since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. However, there has never been hatred between the Chinese people and the Japanese people. Today, the great Chinese people do not distinguish between enemies and friends according to any other standard, but according to the standard of imperialism and anti-imperialism. We adopt a friendly attitude towards the people of all colonial and semi-colonial oppressed nations in the world today, especially the people of other Asian countries. We treat as friends all those who are willing to break away from imperialism instead of serving imperialism, all those who are willing to avoid war instead of participating in the manufacture of war, and all those who are willing to maintain peace instead of deliberately undermining peace, regardless of nationality, class, religious belief, or political belief.
    In the past two years, the greatest contribution of the Chinese people to peace in the Far East and world peace has been the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea. This movement has not only given the Korean people the necessary moral and material assistance, but also produced the world-renowned Chinese People's Volunteers. Why did US imperialism so arrogantly launch the war of aggression against Korea in June 1950, at the risk of destroying peace in Asia, but had to accept the proposal of the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Malik, on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue in June 1951, and had to conduct peace negotiations? This is the result of the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fighting side by side, inflicting serious defeats on US imperialism and its vassal states in the winter of 1950 and the spring and summer of 1951; this is the result of the consistent insistence of the governments and peoples of China and the Soviet Union on the principle of "consolidating lasting peace and universal security in the Far East and the world" stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty since US imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, that the Korean issue must be resolved peacefully. Although US imperialism has used all despicable and wicked tricks to delay, obstruct, and sabotage the Korean armistice negotiations since the start of the Korean armistice negotiations on July 14, 1951, the conspiracy of US imperialism to prolong the war of aggression against Korea is bound to fail. The policy of peaceful settlement of the Korean issue jointly adhered to by the governments and peoples of China and the Soviet Union is bound to be supported by the peace-loving people of all Asia and the world.
    Undoubtedly, in the past two years, the national liberation movements of the colonial and semi-colonial oppressed nations all over the world, especially in Asia, have continued to develop vigorously, no matter how the imperialist countries suppress them. First of all, the people of the heroic Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with the assistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers, are victoriously waging a just war against US imperialist aggression and to defend the independence, democracy, and peace of their motherland. The Vietnamese people have established their own People's Republic and have been recognized by China and the Soviet Union. The Japanese people's liberation struggle against the armed occupation of US imperialism has entered a new stage since the San Francisco Conference. The Philippine people have long established their own People's Liberation Army and have persisted in guerrilla warfare for a long time. The Burmese people, whether in rural or urban areas, are resisting the intensified aggression of British and American imperialism. The Malayan people, regardless of difficulties and hardships, are still continuing their struggle against the colonial robbers of British imperialism. The Indonesian people, after many setbacks, are still continuing their efforts to drive away Dutch imperialism and resist the aggressive forces of US imperialism. The people of all ethnic groups in India, after many tortuous roads, are still making persistent efforts for complete independence and democracy, for the elimination of feudal forces, for the complete expulsion of imperialist forces, and for defending peace in Asia and the world. In the past two years, the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian people has also achieved new development in Southwest Asia and North Africa. The people of Iran, Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco have launched extensive movements to recover sovereignty, strive for independence, and oppose imperialism. In our view, all these liberation movements of the oppressed nations are a great force for defending peace and preventing war; all these struggles are bound to weaken the imperialist camp; all these struggles are not isolated, but are bound to unite to form a torrent that will not stop until it breaks down the imperialist colonial system. We Chinese people, because we have established the People's Republic of China and concluded the Sino-Soviet alliance, are not afraid of any war conspiracies of US imperialism and its vassal states and puppets. We are willing to stand with the people of all colonial and semi-colonial areas in Asia, establish friendly and united relations, and fight to the end to defend peace in Asia and world peace.

### 中苏兄弟同盟是远东及世界和平的坚强保障——庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年

    中苏兄弟同盟是远东及世界和平的坚强保障
    ——庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年
    今天是中苏两国政府和人民缔结中苏友好同盟互助条约、建立中苏兄弟同盟的两周年纪念日。中苏两国的这个伟大的同盟是永久的、不可破坏的、没有人能够分离的，是强大无敌的同盟。这个同盟对于远东及亚洲的和平与安全具有特殊重大的意义。这是因为，俄国革命和中国革命在现代世界政治中所发生的影响是极为巨大的。俄国革命是由俄国无产阶级及其先锋队——布尔塞维克党领导的胜利的社会主义革命；中国革命则是由中国无产阶级及其先锋队——中国共产党领导的胜利的人民民主革命。中苏两国人民在革命胜利的基础上建立起来的中苏同盟，就是以无产阶级为领导的社会主义革命和以无产阶级为领导的被压迫民族的人民民主革命，这两大革命力量相结合的为反对共同敌人——帝国主义而斗争的国际统一战线的骨干。因此，中苏同盟不仅仅是引导中国人民巩固革命胜利的灯塔，同时又是引导全世界殖民地半殖民地国家被压迫民族的人民，首先是亚洲人民，争取革命胜利的灯塔。
    回顾一下，十月革命以前的世界是个什么世界呢？那是一个完全由资本主义统治的世界，那是一个最悲惨的最黑暗的世界。在那个世界中，自从一四九七年葡萄牙商业资本主义的先遣队，由一个名叫伽马的航海家率领，绕过所谓“好望角”，冲入印度洋之后，数百年间，古老的亚洲各国曾经纷纷沦为殖民地和半殖民地。亚洲各国人民，经过欧洲和美洲商业资本主义、工业资本主义和金融资本主义各个不同阶段的外来经济侵略、政治侵略和武装侵略，丧失了独立和自由，丧失了家园和衣食，终于变成了帝国主义的牛马奴隶。在那个世界中，亚洲各国人民，虽然老早就开始了反对帝国主义以及和帝国主义勾结起来的各国统治阶级的英勇斗争，然而始终无法冲出帝国主义的重围，甚至摸索不出一条冲出重围的革命道路。就在这个悲惨和黑暗的时代，十月革命的炮声响了。俄国人民首先突破了那个完全由资本主义统治的世界，首先突破了那个悲惨和黑暗的时代。全世界人民举起双手，欢迎苏联。全亚洲人民举起双手，欢迎苏联。我们中国人民同样举起双手，欢迎苏联，并且经过苏联的介绍，用我们的双手接受了马克思列宁主义的革命武器。然后，就在我们中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东同志的领导之下，将马克思列宁主义的革命理论，和中国革命的实际结合起来，经过了三十多年的英勇斗争，这才获得了中国革命的胜利，建立了中华人民共和国，建立了和资本主义制度根本不同的比资本主义远为优越的人民民主专政的社会制度。由于中国革命的胜利，我们中国人民业已为全世界殖民地半殖民地被压迫民族人民彻底证明了马克思列宁主义的真理，那就是，全世界殖民地半殖民地被压迫民族的人民，首先是亚洲人民，在反对帝国主义侵略、争取独立、和平、民主的伟大斗争中，只有首先团结在各国无产阶级及其政党的周围，团结在全世界无产阶级的周围，团结在以苏联为首的反帝国主义的民主阵营的周围，才能获得胜利。
    两年来，我们中华人民共和国的政府和人民，以中苏同盟为基础，曾经与苏联政府和人民在一道，忠诚合作，参加了所有保障世界和平与安全，首先是保障亚洲和平与安全的一切重大国际活动，并为此充分贡献了我们的力量。在这里，我们要首先提到中苏两国政府和人民为反对美帝国主义及其仆从国家和傀儡们所签订的片面的对日和约，以及为反对美日双边安全条约而进行的坚决斗争。中苏友好同盟互助条约的目的，首先是在于“共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”。但由美国一手操纵的旧金山会议所订立的片面对日和约以及美日双边安全条约的结果，以吉田为首的日本帝国主义残余集团，业已和美帝国主义完全勾结起来了。这种勾结对于日本人民而言，它正带来了无边的灾难；对于我国和亚洲其他国家而言，它将带来新的侵略战争的威胁。谁都知道，日本在第二次世界战争结束以前，是整个亚洲在遭受资本主义侵略时代唯一没有沦为殖民地半殖民地的国家，日本人民遭受了本国资产阶级的压迫，还没有遭受外来资产阶级的压迫；但是，现在的日本实际上已处在美帝国主义武装占领之下，日益走上了殖民地化的道路，日本人民现在所遭受的不仅是本国资产阶级而且是外国资产阶级的双重压迫。在这个新的情况之下，中苏同盟就不仅必须制止日本帝国主义残余集团和美国帝国主义勾结起来、复活日本军国主义、准备新的侵略战争的阴谋，同时，它也必然要支持日本人民反对美帝国主义的军事占领、争取独立、和平、民主的正义斗争。我们中国人民和日本帝国主义，远自甲午战争以来，是有世仇的。然而，在中国人民和日本人民之间，却从来没有仇恨。伟大的中国人民今天不是按照任何其他的尺度，而是按照帝国主义与反帝国主义的尺度来分清敌友。我们对于今天全世界一切殖民地半殖民地被压迫民族的人民，首先对于亚洲其他各国人民，是采取友好态度的。凡愿意脱离帝国主义而不是为帝国主义服务的，凡愿意避免战争而不是参加制造战争的，凡愿意保持和平而不是蓄意破坏和平的，不分民族、不分阶级、不分宗教信仰和政治信仰，我们都拿他们当朋友看待。
    中国人民在近两年间，对于远东和平与世界和平最大的贡献，就是抗美援朝运动。这个运动不仅给予了朝鲜人民以必要的道义援助和物质援助，同时，由于这一运动还产生了全世界闻名的中国人民志愿军。为什么美帝国主义在一九五○年六月，那样狂妄地公然发动侵略朝鲜的战争，不惜破坏亚洲和平，而到了一九五一年六月，却不得不接受苏联驻联合国代表马立克关于和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，不得不进行和平谈判呢？这就是中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，在一九五○年冬季和一九五一年的春季和夏季，使美帝国主义及其仆从国家遭受严重失败的结果；这就是自从美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争以来，中苏两国政府和人民，根据中苏条约所规定的“巩固远东和世界的持久和平与普遍安全”的原则，历次坚持必须和平解决朝鲜问题的结果。尽管美帝国主义自从一九五一年七月十四日朝鲜停战谈判开始以来，用尽一切卑鄙恶劣的伎俩，拖延、阻挠和破坏朝鲜停战谈判，但是美帝国主义延长侵略朝鲜战争的阴谋是一定要失败的。中苏两国政府和人民共同坚持的和平解决朝鲜问题的政策，是一定会得到全亚洲和全世界爱好和平人民的拥护的。
    毫无疑义，最近两年来，全世界，首先是全亚洲，殖民地半殖民地被压迫民族的人民解放运动，不论帝国主义国家如何镇压，仍然是如火如荼地向前发展的。首先，英勇的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人民，在中国人民志愿军的援助之下，正在胜利地进行着反对美帝国主义侵略、保卫自己祖国独立、民主与和平的正义战争。越南人民建立了自己的人民共和国，并且获得了中苏两国的承认。日本人民反对美帝国主义武装占领的解放斗争，自从旧金山会议以后业已走上了一个新阶段。菲律宾人民早已建立了自己的人民解放军，并且长期地坚持了游击战争。缅甸人民无论在乡村和城市中，都在反对英美帝国主义的加紧侵略。马来亚人民不怕艰难困苦，仍然在继续反对英帝国主义殖民强盗的斗争。印度尼西亚人民屡经挫折，仍在继续努力要赶走荷兰帝国主义，并抵抗美帝国主义的侵略势力。印度各族人民，经过了许多曲折的道路，仍然再接再厉地为完全的独立和民主、为消灭封建势力、为彻底赶走帝国主义势力、为保卫亚洲和平与世界和平而斗争。两年来，亚洲人民反帝国主义的斗争又在西南亚洲和北部非洲获得了新的开展。伊朗、埃及、突尼斯、摩洛哥的人民开展了收回主权、争取独立，反对帝国主义的广泛运动。所有这些被压迫民族人民的解放运动，在我们看来，都是保卫和平制止战争的伟大力量；所有这些斗争都必然要削弱帝国主义阵营；所有这些斗争都不是孤立的，而是必然要联合起来形成一股洪流，不冲垮帝国主义殖民地体系决不休止的。我们中国人民由于建立了中华人民共和国，并缔结了中苏同盟，决不畏惧美帝国主义及其仆从国家和傀儡们的任何战争阴谋。我们愿意和全亚洲各殖民地半殖民地的人民站在一起，建立友好团结的关系，为保卫亚洲和平与世界和平而斗争到底。
