(Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, February 26th) TASS Delhi reported on the 26th: The All-India Peace Council held a meeting on the 23rd and 24th at the Delhi Municipal Hall.

Indian Member of Parliament Gamet said at the meeting: The All-India Peace Council must fight unyieldingly to strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty between India and Pakistan.

Davuntali, representing the people of Kashmir, and Rishikesh Shah, representing the All-Nepal Peace Committee, paid their respects to the Indian peace fighters.

Sharma, secretary of the Delhi Unified Progressive Alliance, delivered a speech, vehemently denouncing the war-mongering behavior of Dulles and his ilk, who openly clamor for war against the People's Republic of China. He also condemned the aggressive policies pursued by the American ruling clique, which is encircling the Soviet Union with military bases. Sharma suggested that the Indian government initiate the conclusion of a treaty of friendship among India, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union. This suggestion aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience.

The famous Indian writer Anand said in his speech: "The war in Korea and other regions of Asia, and the occupation of the Taiwan region by American warships, not only threaten the peace and security of China and other countries, but also pose a real threat to the peace and freedom of India. Therefore, American troops must immediately withdraw from these regions, and the wars in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and other countries must be stopped immediately. The five major powers must conclude a peace pact."

The disarmament resolution passed by the closing meeting of the All-India Peace Council stated that India should not subordinate its trade to the interests of countries engaged in expanding their military forces. India should conduct peaceful and free trade with all countries, without any unreasonable economic or political conditions. The resolution called on the Indian government to initiate the conclusion of a five-power peace pact.

The resolution on relations between India and Pakistan called on the governments of both countries to immediately establish normal relations in culture, trade, and other areas, and to allow the people of Kashmir to decide their own destiny.

The resolution on conflicts in Asia and North Africa pointed out that the Korean War threatens the peace of the entire Asia, and this war is caused by the policies of the United States. The resolution called on the Indian government to prohibit foreign countries from using India's natural resources and manpower, as well as India's ports and airports, for war purposes. The resolution also advocated convening a meeting within three months, with the participation of people of different political persuasions, to discuss how India should take steps to resolve all military conflicts in Asia and North Africa and prevent a third world war.

After the closing of the All-India Peace Council meeting, Delhi peace fighters held a grand gathering, at which the resolutions of the Council were unanimously approved.
