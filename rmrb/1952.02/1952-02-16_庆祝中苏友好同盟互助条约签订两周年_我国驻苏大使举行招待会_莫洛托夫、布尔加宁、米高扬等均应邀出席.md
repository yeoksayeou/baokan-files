Ambassador Zhang said in his speech: "Dear guests! Today is the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. On this festive occasion, please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, to express my deep gratitude and warm congratulations to the Soviet comrades present and to the great Soviet people you represent. The history of the past two short years has fully demonstrated the great significance of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance in defending peace and security in the Far East and opposing imperialist aggression in Asia. Over the past two years, the Soviet people, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and related agreements, have provided the Chinese people with sincere and generous assistance, which has greatly helped China's economic recovery and development, as well as the consolidation of the country. All of this has deeply moved and encouraged the Chinese people, making them even more convinced that Sino-Soviet friendship is the foundation for the Chinese people to move towards final victory, a powerful guarantee for the independence and prosperity of the People's Republic of China, and a great force for consolidating peace in the Far East and the world. Precisely for this reason, the Chinese people, who cherish Sino-Soviet friendship as they cherish their own eyes, express their deep gratitude to the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and Marshal Stalin, and sincerely wish that this friendship will be consolidated forever and ever. Now, American imperialists are rearming Japan in Asia, reviving Japanese militarism, and organizing dark forces in Asia to oppose the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, expanding their aggression against Asia. Therefore, further consolidating the Sino-Soviet alliance of friendship and mutual assistance is of even greater significance. We are deeply convinced that the great unity of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union, as well as the great national liberation movements of Asian countries, will surely smash all the evil plots of imperialism in Asia. We are equally convinced that the powerful forces of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp, headed by the great Soviet Union, will surely defeat the imperialist aggressors and war instigators and achieve victory in the great cause of world peace! Let me raise a glass to the everlasting and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union! Long live lasting world peace and the friendship of all peoples of the world! Long live Comrade Stalin, the teacher of progressive mankind, the standard-bearer of peace, and the best friend of the Chinese people!"

Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Molotov then raised his glass and said, "Comrades, please allow me, on behalf of all the Soviet people present, on behalf of the Soviet government and Comrade Stalin, to salute the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China and the victorious, power-seizing, strong, and powerful Chinese people he represents. Please allow me to drink to the prosperity and happiness of the Chinese people, to the achievements of our consolidated and powerful ally and friend, the People's Republic of China, to the consolidated, unbreakable, and eternal Sino-Soviet friendship, and to the health of Mao Zedong and his comrades-in-arms."

Ambassador Zhang then repeatedly raised his glass to the health of Marshal Stalin's closest comrades-in-arms, Soviet Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers Molotov, Bulganin, and Mikoyan, to the health of the loyal executors of Stalin's peaceful policies, Soviet Deputy Ministers of Foreign Affairs Gromyko, Zorin, and Bogomolov, and to the health of the heroic and invincible Soviet Army and the Soviet Marshals and Generals.

Next, Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Marshal Bulganin raised his glass and said, "Comrades, on behalf of the Soviet Armed Forces, on behalf of the soldiers, officers, generals, and marshals, I extend my warm greetings to the heroic and glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army led by Mao Zedong and Zhu De, and to its soldiers, officers, and generals, and to the Chinese armed forces that are being built."

Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikoyan raised his glass and said, "Please allow me to wish health to Mao Zedong's comrades-in-arms, Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai."

Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Gromyko raised his glass and said, "Please allow me to drink to the prosperity of the People's Republic of China, to the friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union – this friendship has proven to be a pillar of international peace and security – and also to the health of Zhang Wentian, the outstanding diplomat and Ambassador of the People's Republic of China."

At the reception, the Chinese Youth Art Troupe sang songs such as "Ode to Stalin," "The East is Red," "People of the World Are of One Heart," and "Moscow-Beijing," and performed the Yangge dance to add to the festive atmosphere.

The reception took place in a warm and friendly atmosphere and lasted until late into the night.

    张大使在会上致词说：亲爱的来宾们！今天是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的二周年，请允许我在此节日，代表我国政府和我国人民，向在座的苏联同志，并向你们所代表的伟大的苏联人民，致深切的感谢和热烈的祝贺。短短的两年来的历史，已经充分证明了中苏友好同盟互助条约对于保卫远东和平与安全、反对帝国主义在亚洲的侵略的巨大意义。两年来，苏联人民依照中苏条约及有关各协定的精神，给予中国人民的热诚的、慷慨的援助，大大地帮助了中国经济的恢复和发展及国家的巩固。这一切深深地感动了和鼓舞了中国人民，使他们更加深信中苏友谊是中国人民走向最后胜利的基础，是中华人民共和国独立和繁荣的有力保证，是巩固远东和世界和平的伟大力量。正因为这样，像珍视自己的眼睛一样珍视中苏友谊的中国人民，都向苏联人民、苏联政府和斯大林大元帅表示深切的感谢，并衷心愿望这一友谊永远地、永远地巩固下去。现在，美帝国主义者正在亚洲重新武装日本，复活日本军国主义，组织亚洲的黑暗势力，来反对中华人民共和国、反对苏联，扩大其对亚洲的侵略。因此，进一步巩固中苏友好同盟互助，就具有更为巨大的意义。我们深信，中苏两国七万万人民的伟大的联合，以及亚洲各国伟大的民族解放运动，定能把帝国主义在亚洲的一切罪恶的阴谋诡计，打得粉碎。我们同样深信，以伟大的苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营的强大力量，定能击败帝国主义侵略者和战争挑拨者，取得世界和平的伟大事业的胜利！让我举杯祝贺：中苏两国人民永久的、牢不可破的友好万岁！世界持久和平与世界各族人民的友好万岁！世界进步人类的导师、和平的旗手、中国人民最好的朋友斯大林同志万岁！
    苏联部长会议副主席莫洛托夫接着举杯说：“同志们，请允许我代表所有在座的苏联人，代表苏联政府和斯大林同志，向中华人民共和国大使和他所代表的、已经胜利的、掌握了政权的、坚强的和强大的中国人民致敬。请允许我为中国人民的繁荣和幸福，为我们的巩固的和强大的同盟者和朋友——中华人民共和国的成绩，为巩固的、牢不可破的、永远的中苏友谊，为毛泽东及其战友们的健康干杯。”
