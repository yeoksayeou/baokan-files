    Nationwide Snowfall
    Snowfall Amount Still Cannot Alleviate Spring Drought Threat, All Localities Should Actively Mobilize the Masses to Conserve Moisture with Accumulated Snow
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] From February 13th to 14th, spring snow fell generally throughout various regions. In the North China region, the snowfall amount was equivalent to approximately two to five millimeters of precipitation (one millimeter equals 0.03 inches); in the plains provinces, the snowfall amount was equivalent to more than five millimeters of precipitation; in the Northwest region, the snowfall amount was relatively small, equivalent to less than one millimeter of precipitation; in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the precipitation amount was around ten millimeters.
    This spring snow is beneficial for spring plowing in drought-stricken areas; however, the amount of snow is small and far from sufficient to supply the soil with enough moisture. Especially since January of this year was completely dry, the vast areas north of the Longhai Railway, south of Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, and Chahar, east to the coast, and west to Gansu and Qinghai, all had less than one millimeter of precipitation in January, or no snowfall at all. Coupled with the lack of snow last winter, the soil is dry and the water demand is very high, so the drought situation is still very serious. Comparing last year's spring snowfall with this year's spring snowfall: last year in January, the snowfall amount in the North China region was equivalent to more than four to five millimeters of precipitation; in February, the snowfall amount in the North China and Northwest regions was equivalent to between ten and twenty millimeters of precipitation; the snowfall amount this time is only one-fifth of last February's snowfall amount. Last year, there was more snowfall in January and February, but spring drought still occurred. Therefore, this snowfall has not yet eliminated the threat of spring drought. All localities should pay special attention to preventing blind optimism and the paralyzing thought of relaxing drought prevention and resistance work; at the same time, it is also necessary to cherish and preserve these water resources as much as possible. In areas that have not yet thawed, the masses should be mobilized to accumulate snow; in areas that have thawed, the masses should be mobilized to harrow the land to preserve moisture. Land that has not undergone autumn plowing should be plowed early in the spring and harrowed and covered frequently.

### 全国各地普遍降雪  降雪量仍然不能解除春旱威胁各地应积极发动群众积雪保墒

    全国各地普遍降雪
    降雪量仍然不能解除春旱威胁各地应积极发动群众积雪保墒
    【本报讯】二月十三日到十四日，各地普降春雪。华北区降雪量约合降水量二至五公厘（一公厘合零点零三寸），平原全省降雪量约合降水量五公厘以上；西北区降雪量较小，合降水量不到一公厘；长江下游降水量在十公厘上下。
    这场春雪对于干旱地区的春耕是有好处的；但雪量小，还远不能供给土壤以足够的水分。特别是今年一月份全月干旱，陇海路以北，内蒙古、绥远、察哈尔以南，东到沿海，西到甘肃、青海的广大地区，一月份降水量都在一公厘以下，或者还没有降雪，再加上去冬缺雪，土壤干燥，需水量很大，因此干旱现象仍然是很严重的。以去年春季降雪量和今年春季比较：去年一月份华北地区降雪量约合降水量四至五公厘以上，二月份，华北、西北地区降雪量约合降水量在十公厘至二十公厘之间；这次降雪量与去年二月份的降雪量比较，则仅为去年二月份的五分之一。去年一、二月份降雪较多，仍发生了春旱，因此这次降雪，还没有解除春旱的威胁。各地应当特别注意防止盲目乐观和放松防旱抗旱工作的麻痹思想；同时也必须尽可能地珍惜保存这些水分，在尚未解冻的地区，应发动群众积雪；在已解冻的地区，应发动群众耙地保墒，没有经过秋耕的土地，应提早春耕并勤加耙盖。
