    North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters Instructs Subordinates to Closely Coordinate Spring Planting, Drought Prevention, and Disaster Relief, and to Do a Good Job in the Supply of Production Materials and the Purchase of Native and Subsidiary Products
    In order to coordinate drought prevention, spring planting, and disaster relief work, the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters has issued instructions calling on all levels of subordinate cooperatives to supply peasants with production materials in a timely and sufficient manner, and to vigorously purchase native and subsidiary products from peasants (focusing on disaster areas) to ensure the successful completion of spring planting production. The instructions state: Each cooperative above the county level should immediately extract one director or deputy director who has been vetted and is clean-handed from the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, as well as a certain number (such as one-third) of cadres, to be specifically responsible for leading and supervising cooperatives at all levels in carrying out this work; grassroots cooperatives should devote all their efforts to leading and assisting members and the masses in carrying out spring planting, drought prevention, and disaster relief work.
    The instructions point out: Cooperatives must do a good job in supplying production materials such as fertilizers, seeds, agricultural implements, pesticides, and drought prevention equipment. Especially fertilizers, since cooperatives have been entrusted by the state to implement a complete supply, the quantity is very large, and most of the cake fertilizer and miscellaneous fertilizers must be processed or purchased by themselves, so the task is very arduous. As of January, the number processed and purchased accounted for only 15 percent of the original planned task. Including the soybean cake already shipped in from Northeast China, the entire region has only prepared 20 percent of the fertilizer needed during the spring planting period. The situation is very serious. If the task of supplying fertilizer cannot be completed in a timely manner, this year's agricultural production will be significantly affected. To this end, in addition to immediately dispatching personnel to Northeast China to urge the timely transfer of the required soybean cake, the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters also requires cooperatives at all levels to quickly establish production materials management departments (or sections, divisions), extract special personnel, and earnestly inspect the processing and purchase of fertilizers. In order to understand the supply of fertilizers in a timely manner, cooperatives at all levels should be held responsible for establishing a weekly reporting system at each level. For fertilizers that have already been shipped in from Northeast China, four methods must be adopted: immediate sale, immediate exchange, credit sales orders, and actual storage pre-sales, so that they can be released to the peasants in a timely manner, and no backlog or delay is allowed, delaying spring planting. It is also necessary to patiently persuade the masses to promote the use of fertilizer powder. And technical guidance on the use of fertilizer powder should be organized.
    The instructions point out: The purchase of native and subsidiary products is an important task to support disaster victims in production to overcome famine and solve the difficulties of spring planting and sowing. The North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters has allocated a portion of funds to the four provinces of Pingyuan, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Hebei specifically for the purchase of native and subsidiary products in disaster areas. It is necessary to strictly prevent the tendency to only promote hot-selling goods and not promote slow-selling goods from occurring. Cooperatives at all levels should formulate specific plans for purchasing and selling during the spring planting period. For products that are not easy to sell locally, a method of reporting level by level and being responsible level by level can be adopted to solve the problem, and it is absolutely not allowed to ignore them.
    In order to effectively promote spring business in various places, the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative Headquarters has dispatched three capable section chiefs and four staff members to work with the North China Administrative Committee and other departments to conduct inspections in Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The instructions also require cooperatives at all levels to dispatch inspection teams at the same time. In some cooperatives or their management departments, where corrupt elements have seized key positions, causing business to stagnate, appropriate personnel should be immediately sent to take over and restore work there.

    华北供销合作总社指示所属
    密切配合春耕防旱和生产救灾工作
    做好生产资料的供应和土产副产的收购工作
    为了配合防旱、春耕和生产救灾工作，华北供销合作总社已发出指示，号召所属各级社及时地、充分地供应农民以生产资料，大力收购农民的土产副产品（着重灾区），以保证春耕生产的胜利完成。指示中说：县以上各级合作社应即从反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中抽出经过审查、手面干净的主任或副主任一人及一定数量（比如三分之一）的干部，专门负责领导督促各级合作社进行这项工作；基层社则应全力领导和扶助社员、群众进行春耕、防旱和生产救灾工作。
    指示中指出：合作社必须做好肥料、籽种、农具、农药、防旱用具等生产资料的供应工作。尤其是肥料，由于合作社已接受国家委托，实行全部供应，数量很大，大部饼肥及杂肥又须自行加工或收购，因此，任务十分艰巨。到一月份为止，加工收购数仅占原计划任务的百分之十五。连已运进的东北豆饼在内，全区所备肥料也仅有春耕期间所需肥料的百分之二十。情况是十分严重的。如不能及时完成供应肥料的任务，今年农业生产将受重大影响。为此，华北供销合作总社除立即派员到东北，催促所需豆饼及时调运外，并要求各级合作社迅速建立生产资料经理部（或科、股），抽出专人，切实检查肥料的加工和收购工作。为了及时了解供应肥料的情况，并应责成各级合作社建立逐级的周报制度。对于从东北已运进的肥料，必须采用现售、现换、赊销订购、存实预售四种方式，及时下放到农民手里，不得积压和拖延，耽误春耕。并必须耐心说服群众，提倡使用肥田粉。并应组织对使用肥田粉的技术指导。
    指示指出：收购土产副产品是扶植灾民生产度荒，并解决春耕播种的困难的重要工作。华北供销合作总社已筹拨一部资金给平原、察哈尔、绥远、河北四省，专门收购灾区土产副产品。要严防只推销热货，不推销冷货的偏向发生。各级合作社要制订春耕期间收购、推销的具体计划。对在本地不易推销的产品，可采取逐级上报逐级负责的办法解决，决不许置之不管。
    为切实推动各地春季业务，华北供销合作总社已派出得力的科长三人，科员四人，配合华北行政委员会等部门，分赴河北、平原、山西、察哈尔、绥远进行检查。指示中并要求各级合作社也同时派出检查组。在某些合作社或它的经理部门，因贪污分子窃据要津，使业务陷于停顿的地方，要立即派适当的人员去接替，恢复那里的工作。
