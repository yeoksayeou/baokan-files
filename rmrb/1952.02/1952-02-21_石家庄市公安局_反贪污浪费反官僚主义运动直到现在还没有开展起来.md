    To the Editor: Our Shijiazhuang Public Security Bureau's anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has not truly been launched because the leading comrades are unwilling to get personally involved and are even obstructing it.

    The Shijiazhuang Public Security Bureau's Thrift Examination Committee is controlled by the secretary director, Li Jizhen, and the personnel section chief, Niu Maotang, both of whom have dirty hands. Since the beginning of the movement, the Thrift Examination Committee has only held one "establishment meeting" and one "report meeting," and has not played a leading role in the movement at all. Li Jizhen is the direct leader of Wanlongtai, the Shijiazhuang Public Security Bureau's production organization. In his "self-criticism report," he asserted, "Wanlongtai only has waste, not corruption." Li Jizhen and Wanlongtai's manager, Chen Chuntang, have an inexplicable relationship. In the past, when Zhang Xuchang, the bureau's administrative secretary (who was in charge of production at the time), criticized some of Chen Chuntang's wasteful practices, Li Jizhen became very angry and "criticized" Zhang Xuchang in return. On another occasion, Chen Chuntang spent a lot of money on a trip to the Northeast (the detailed amount is yet to be investigated) that could not be accounted for, but Li Jizhen eventually approved the expense. Wanlongtai's manager, Chen Chuntang, is a former rogue and puppet regime element with a major criminal history (there are already mass accusation materials); the sales director, a certain Lu, is a major Tianjin merchant who still has businesses in Tianjin; the accountant, Wang Feizi, is the manager's wife. Wanlongtai is no longer the Shijiazhuang Public Security Bureau's "production organization," but a stronghold for treacherous merchants and gangsters lurking in the revolutionary camp. The masses call Li Jizhen "Long Live Li," call Chen Chuntang "Long Live Chen," and call Wang Feizi "Long Live Wang." Now, the inspection team has discovered their crimes of embezzling gold, cloth, and money, but Li Jizhen has come forward to obstruct the inspection team. The personnel section chief, Niu Maotang, has consistently suppressed democracy. On the evening of February 8, at a Party member meeting, when a comrade mentioned Wanlongtai's corruption, Niu Maotang immediately stopped the speech and adjourned the meeting. The manager of our bureau's affiliated "Gexin Sales Department" (a prison production unit), Wang Weimin, has been accused of many acts of corruption (500 million yuan in border currency and other items), but Wang Weimin is still cunningly denying and stubbornly refusing to confess. The masses are demanding that Wang Weimin be sent to court for punishment, but the leadership is still not taking action. The above situation shows that Li Jizhen, Niu Maotang, and others are not only colluding with each other, obstructing the movement, and shielding corrupt elements, but they themselves also have major problems.

    Please have the relevant leaders quickly investigate and deal with this matter so that our anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement can be launched quickly.

### 石家庄市公安局  反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动直到现在还没有开展起来

    石家庄市公安局
    反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动直到现在还没有开展起来
    编辑同志：我们石家庄市公安局的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，由于领导同志不肯亲自下水，并且还起阻碍作用，所以到现在还是没有真正开展起来。
    石家庄市公安局节约检查委员会是由手脚不干净的秘书主任李继真和人事科长牛茂堂等包办组成的。从运动开始到现在，节约检查委员会只开过一次“成立会”和一次“汇报会”，根本没有在运动中起领导作用。李继真是石家庄市公安局生产机关万隆泰的直接领导人，他在作“检讨报告”时，肯定地说：“万隆泰只有浪费，没有贪污。”李继真和万隆泰经理陈春堂有着令人不解的关系，过去本局行政秘书张许昌（当时是领导生产的）对陈春堂的一些浪费现象提出批评时，李继真曾经大发脾气，并反过来“批评”了张许昌。又一次，陈春堂去东北一趟，化了很多钱（详细数目待查），上不了账，后来李继真给他上了账。万隆泰经理陈春堂是一个大流氓出身的敌伪人员（有重大罪行，已有群众检举材料）；营业主任卢某，是天津市的一个大奸商，现在仍在天津市有买卖；会计王妃子是经理的老婆。万隆泰已经不是石家庄市公安局的“生产机关”，而是奸商歹徒们潜伏在革命阵营中的堡垒了。群众称李继真为“万万岁”，称陈春堂为“万岁”，称王妃子为“千岁”，现在，检查组已经检查出他们贪污黄金、布匹、钱财的罪行，但李继真却出面刁难检查组。人事科长牛茂堂一贯压制民主。二月八日晚，在党员大会上，有一位同志提起万隆泰的贪污情形，牛茂堂马上制止发言，并宣布散会。本局所属“革新门市部”（监狱生产单位）经理王维民，曾经被检举出许多贪污事实（五亿元边币和其它东西），但王维民直到现在仍然狡猾抵赖，死不坦白，群众纷纷要求把王维民送法院惩办，但领导方面仍不处理。上述情况，可以说明李继真、牛茂堂等，不只互相勾结，阻碍运动，包庇贪污分子，而且他们本身也大有问题。
    请有关领导方面，迅速检查处理，使我们的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动迅速开展起来。
