    People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Oil Materials Department, Technical Section Chief Yu Zhongyou was dragged into the mire by the insidious and despicable merchant Dong Shijie.

    Yu Zhongyou is thirty-three years old this year. He joined the Communist Youth League in 1933 and became a member of the Communist Party in 1938. He never wavered during the past arduous struggles. However, after the national revolution's victory, he was defeated by the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets.

    In the spring of 1949, Yu Zhongyou arrived in Tianjin. At that time, he was the oil materials section chief of a certain department. Because of business relations, he met the cunning merchant Dong Shijie. From then on, Dong Shijie began to target Yu Zhongyou, often coming to the office to lure him. Dong said, "Now that you've come to Tianjin, just say what you need, and it's no problem." Yu Zhongyou ignored him. Then Dong Shijie repeatedly invited Yu Zhongyou to dinner and to the theater, but he was refused each time. Later, Dong Shijie re-examined his approach to attacking Yu Zhongyou. Finally, he discovered that Yu Zhongyou's family did not have a radio, so he wanted to give Yu Zhongyou a radio worth 20 million yuan. To paralyze Yu Zhongyou, the radio was sent by Guan Shucheng, a procurement员 from the Transportation Department. Guan Shucheng was in the speculative business with him. Guan Shucheng found Yu Zhongyou and said, "Section Chief Yu, everyone else has a radio, why don't you get one? A radio can be used to listen to music for entertainment; on the other hand, it can also be used to listen to various news reports and study." As he spoke, he took out the radio and placed it on the table. He said with a grin, "This radio I'm giving you is American-made and can receive broadcasts from all over the world." Yu Zhongyou flatly refused, "Why would I want your things! Where did a procurement员 like you get so much money to buy this? Take it back quickly, I don't like it." Guan Shucheng couldn't save face, so he told the truth: "This was sent by Dong Shijie. He saw that you didn't have a radio and asked me to give it to you." Yu Zhongyou still refused to accept it. But not long after, Dong Shijie took another very beautiful radio and asked Guan to deliver it. This attack was also unsuccessful.

    After two failed offensives, Dong Shijie—this shameless guy—did not give up. He learned that Yu Zhongyou was going to work in the South. So, on the day before Yu Zhongyou went south, he sent Guan Shucheng with fruit, a radio, and one tael of gold to Yu Zhongyou's dormitory. As soon as Guan Shucheng entered the door, he put the things in the closet, saying that it was some fruit for the children to eat. Later, Yu Zhongyou checked and found gold and a radio. At that time, he thought, "As a matter of friendship, people are giving gifts to me once or twice, I shouldn't refuse anymore." This was a completely losing his ground thinking. Cunning merchants are by no means friends, but fierce enemies. Since he had already lost his ground, although he later thought, "Accepting other people's gifts is probably not good, I should return them," he still did not draw a clear line between the enemy and us. Therefore, his will to reject bribes was also not firm. As a result, before getting on the train, Yu Zhongyou did not find Guan Shucheng, so he boarded the train with the bribes he had been given. At this time, he still had inner struggles. He thought that Guan Shucheng would definitely come to see him off, and he would return the things to him then. But on the platform, Guan Shucheng didn't arrive until the train was about to leave. He said, "Those things were given to you by Manager Dong. This isn't a bribe, it's a gift from a friend." Yu Zhongyou originally wanted to return the things to him, but the train had already started. At this time, he was completely in line with the despicable thoughts of the cunning merchant, so he thought: "People are giving gifts time and time again, this is affection. It's not good to keep refusing, it seems like I don't understand human relations."

    As a result, not long after Yu Zhongyou arrived in Hankou, Dong Shijie and other cunning merchants also arrived in Hankou. Dong Shijie found Yu Zhongyou that day, shamelessly asking for "照顾", asking him to give him some business to do. Because Yu Zhongyou had accepted the cunning merchant's things, he had no choice but to do things for the cunning merchant. At that time, the oil materials section had 30,000 oil drums that needed to be repainted. Many merchants bid but failed to win the bid. Yu Zhongyou let Dong Shijie do this business (there is no way to count the amount of state assets that Dong Shijie stole from this business).

    The cunning merchant's attack was one step closer than the next. At the end of 1950, Yu Zhongyou was transferred to work in the Oil Materials Department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission. Dong also came to Beijing with him. This insidious cunning merchant, in order to further corrupt Yu Zhongyou, inquired about Yu Zhongyou's social connections in many ways. When he learned that Yu Zhongyou had a mother-in-law in Beijing, he sent gifts to Yu's mother-in-law. In addition, he also sent Yu Zhongyou's brother a barrel of kerosene. Dong Shijie saw that Yu Zhongyou's child did not have a bed, so he bought two beds for him. Later, Yu Zhongyou insisted on returning the 200,000 yuan for the beds to Dong Shijie. Dong Shijie used the 200,000 yuan to buy prize-winning savings bonds for Yu's mother-in-law. Dong saw that the small car that Yu Zhongyou's child was riding in was old, and immediately said: "It's too dangerous for the child to ride in such a bad car! Send it to the factory to be repaired." As a result, what was sent back was a new car. Under the cunning merchant Dong Shijie's series of offensives, Yu Zhongyou had no choice but to do more things for the cunning merchant Dong Shijie. Once, Dong Shijie and another cunning merchant transported ten tons of automobile parts from Tianjin to Hankou, and asked Yu Zhongyou to write a letter of proof. As a result, Dong Shijie used this letter of proof to transport ten tons of automobile parts for free using the people's trains, and the taxes that should have been paid on these ten tons of automobile parts were also completely evaded.

    The cunning merchant Dong Shijie's offensive against Yu Zhongyou did not stop until after the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched. During the movement, he attempted to establish an "alliance of offense and defense" with Yu Zhongyou, so he repeatedly called Yu Zhongyou and his younger brother, telling Yu Zhongyou not to confess their two's criminal acts. At the same time, he also found Yu Zhongyou's mother-in-law and asked her to mobilize Yu Zhongyou not to confess. He said, "Section Chief Yu is too timid. The movement will be over in a few days. It's no big deal if you don't confess." Until January 21st of this year, Dong Shijie still called Yu Zhongyou's younger brother, and even asked him to hold Yu Zhongyou back. But Dong Shijie's despicable attempt was crushed, and Yu Zhongyou finally exposed the facts of Dong Shijie's bribery in front of the masses.

    于忠友怎样陷入了奸商的阴险圈套
    朱波
    人民革命军事委员会油料部技术处处长于忠友，是被阴险而卑鄙的奸商董士杰拖到泥坑里面去的。
    于忠友今年三十三岁，一九三三年参加共产主义青年团，一九三八年转为共产党员。在过去艰苦斗争中，从没有动摇过。但在全国革命胜利后，却被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹所击败。
    一九四九年春天，于忠友到了天津。当时他是某部的油料处处长。因为业务上的关系，认识了奸商董士杰。从此，董士杰就把于忠友作为进攻的对象，常到机关来勾引于忠友。董说：“来到天津了，缺什么东西只要说出来，都不成问题。”于忠友没理他。接着董士杰又数次请于忠友吃饭、看戏，也都被拒绝了。后来，董士杰就重新研究进攻于忠友的办法。最后，他发现于忠友家里没有收音机，就要送给于忠友一部价值两千万元的收音机。为了麻痹于忠友，收音机是让运输部的采购员关树成送去的。关树成是和他一起做投机生意的。关树成找到于忠友，说：“于处长，别人都有部收音机，你怎么不搞一部呢？收音机一方面可以听音乐，娱乐娱乐；一方面还可以收听各种新闻，进行学习。”说着就把收音机拿出来，放在桌子上。并且嬉皮笑脸地说：“我送给你的这部收音机，是美国造的，可以收听世界各国的广播。”于忠友很干脆地拒绝了：“我为什么要你的东西！你一个采购员那来这样多的钱、买这东西？趁早拿回去，我不喜欢这个。”关树成一时下不来台，这才照实地说：“这是董士杰送的。他看着你没有收音机，要我送给你的。”于忠友依然拒绝接受。但隔了不久，董士杰又拿了一部很漂亮的收音机叫关去送。这次进攻也没有成功。
    在两次进攻失败以后，董士杰——这个无耻的家伙，并没有死心。他得到了于忠友要到南方工作的消息。于是在于忠友南下的头一天，又派关树成拿着水果、一个收音机、一两金子到了于忠友的宿舍。关树成一进门，就把东西放进壁橱里，说是一点给孩子吃的水果。后来于忠友一检查，发现有金子、收音机。当时他想：“作为交朋友来说，人家一次两次地给自己送礼，不应该再拒绝了。”这是一种完全丧失立场的想法。奸商决不是什么朋友，而是凶恶的敌人。他既然已经丧失了立场，所以后来虽然想到“接受别人的礼物恐怕影响不好，还是退回去吧”，但他仍然没有划清敌我界限。所以他拒绝贿赂的意志也是不坚定的。结果，在上火车以前，于忠友没有找到关树成，就带着人家给的贿赂品上了火车。这时他还有内心斗争，他想关树成一定会来送他，那时再给他退回去。但是在站台上一直等到快开车的时候，关树成才跑来，说：“那东西是董经理送给你的。那不是贿赂你，这是做为一个朋友送给你的。”于忠友原想把东西还给他，可是火车已经开了。这时，他就和奸商的卑污思想完全一致起来，所以他想：“人家一次一次地送东西，这是情义。一直拒绝不收不好，好像不懂人情似的。”
    这一来，于忠友到汉口不久，董士杰等奸商也就跟着到了汉口。董士杰当天找到于忠友，厚着脸皮，要求“照顾”，要求给他一些生意做。于忠友因为收了奸商的东西，就不能不给奸商办事了。当时油料处有三万个油桶要重新喷漆，很多商人投标没有投上，于忠友就让董士杰做了这笔生意（董士杰从这笔生意中盗窃的国家资财没有办法统计）。
    奸商的进攻是一步紧似一步的。一九五○年底，于忠友被调到人民革命军事委员会油料部工作。董也随着来了北京。这个阴险的奸商为了进一步腐蚀于忠友，便多方打听于忠友的社会关系。当他知道于忠友在北京有一个岳母的时候，就送礼物给于的岳母。另外，又送给于忠友的兄弟一桶煤油。董士杰看到于忠友的小孩没有床，就给买了两张床。后来，于忠友硬把二十万元的床钱还给了董士杰，董士杰就把这二十万元买成有奖储蓄券给了于的岳母。董看到于忠友的小孩坐的小车是旧的，马上就说：“小孩坐这样的坏车子多危险！送到工厂修一修吧。”结果送来的却是一辆新车。在奸商董士杰一连串的攻势下，于忠友不能不给奸商董士杰做更多的事情。有一次，董士杰和另一奸商从天津向汉口运十吨汽车零件，让于忠友写一封证明信。结果，董士杰就凭这封证明信白白用人民的火车运了十吨汽车零件，而且这十吨汽车零件应缴的税款也全部漏掉了。
    奸商董士杰对于忠友的攻势，直到反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开以后，还没有停止。在运动中，他企图和于忠友订立“攻守同盟”，因此三番五次地打电话给于忠友和他的弟弟，让于忠友不要坦白他们两人的罪恶行为。同时又找到于忠友的岳母，托她动员于忠友不要坦白，他说：“于处长胆子太小了，运动几天就过去了，不坦白也没有什么了不起。”直到今年一月二十一日，董士杰还打电话给于忠友的弟弟，还让他拖于忠友的后腿。但是董士杰的可耻企图被粉碎了，于忠友终于把董士杰行贿的事实，在群众面前揭露出来。
