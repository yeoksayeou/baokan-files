    The Anti-Corruption Struggle is Developing in Depth within the First-Level Organs of the CCP Songjiang District Committee
    Editor: Regarding the letter from Comrade Geng Lang published in the "Readers' Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 26, exposing the lack of enthusiasm of certain leading cadres of the CCP Songjiang District Committee towards the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, we have studied it and respond as follows: Before January 7, the Songjiang District Committee's first-level organs studied documents on anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, and conducted preliminary internal reorganization of the organs. During this period, Acting Secretary Comrade Yang Chun and Second Deputy Secretary Comrade Yu Ke successively conveyed the resolutions of the Party Central Committee and higher-level Party organizations at district committee meetings, joint meetings of section and bureau chiefs, and general membership meetings of Party members. They also made a preliminary inspection of the extravagant and wasteful phenomena existing within the district committee itself. Because some responsible comrades of the district committee did not sufficiently understand the significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement at that time, the movement did not truly unfold. On the 7th, the district committee conducted an inspection of the previous stage of the movement. Comrade Yu Ke made a more thorough self-criticism and reflection at a meeting of all organ personnel. In the past, the district committee had been extravagant and wasteful in construction, pursued comfort in life, and overspent 134 million yuan; violated the car usage system (stipulating one car, but actually using two, and sometimes the children and wives of responsible comrades of the district committee also used the cars) overspending more than 19 million yuan; and in entertaining guests, there was a strong bourgeois vulgar socializing style, and personal living expenses were often overspent. The above demonstrated that the responsible cadres of the district committee had a self-proclaimed meritorious attitude, a privileged mentality, abused their authority to undermine the system, and caused serious extravagance and waste. We have made a relatively deep exposure of these major issues. After this battle, the masses were generally mobilized, and the problems existing in the leadership were basically resolved. Since the 17th, the movement has entered a climax. After more than ten days of vigorous struggle, 429 people who confessed to corruption have been identified. The current shortcoming of the movement is a lack of depth. According to various sources, there are also major corrupt elements who have embezzled more than 100 million yuan within the Songjiang District Committee and the commissioner's office. Therefore, since the 26th, we have redeployed, implementing a comprehensive search of the mountains, layer-by-layer encirclement, internal and external attack, and tracking and capture methods to capture both big and small tigers.

### 中共松江地委一级机关反贪污斗争正深入发展

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中共松江地委一级机关反贪污斗争正深入发展
    编辑同志：一月二十六日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了耿浪同志揭发中共松江地委某些领导干部对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动表现不积极的来信，我们经过研究后，答复如下：在一月七日以前，松江地委一级机关学习关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的文件，进行机关内部初步整编。这个期间，代理书记杨纯同志和第二副书记余克同志先后在地委会议、科局长联席会议以及党员大会上，传达党中央及上级党的决议，并对地委本身存在的铺张浪费现象，作了初步检查。由于当时地委某些负责同志对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的意义认识不足，因此，运动没有真正展开。七日，地委对前一段运动进行了检查，余克同志在全体机关人员会议上，进行了较彻底的检讨反省。地委过去在修建中铺张浪费，在生活上讲究舒适，超支一亿三千四百万元；破坏乘用汽车制度（规定一辆，实用二辆，有时地委负责同志的孩子老婆也坐汽车）超支一千九百多万元；在请客招待上，存在着浓厚的资产阶级的庸俗应酬作风，个人生活费用也常超支。以上表现了地委负责干部存在着功臣自居，特权思想，利用职权破坏制度，造成严重的铺张浪费的错误。我们对这些主要问题，都作了较深刻的揭发。经过这一战斗，群众是普遍地发动起来了，领导方面存在的问题也获得了基本解决。自十七日起，运动进入了高潮。经过十多天轰轰烈烈的斗争，坦白的贪污分子已达四百二十九人。现在运动的缺点是深度不够。根据各方材料来看，贪污一亿元以上的大贪污分子，在松江地委、专署一级机关内也是存在的。因此，自二十六日起，又重新布署，实行全面搜山，层层包围，内外夹攻，跟踪追捕的办法，捕捉大小老虎。
