[News from this newspaper] With active exposure from the broad masses and approval from higher authorities, the judicial organs of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government have ordered the arrest of two extremely wicked major embezzlers: Li Yuquan, Deputy Section Chief of the Management Section of the Provincial Department of Industry, and Jin Fade, Deputy Section Chief of the Trial Section.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the criminal Li Yuquan served as the manager of the Guizhou Match Factory. After liberation, he was retained in the Supply and Marketing Section of the Provincial Department of Industry and Mining as section chief. From his first day in office, he organized an embezzlement ring, systematically setting up an embezzlement network to convert public property into private gain, establish private businesses, collude with unscrupulous merchants from other regions, engage in corruption and malpractice, and steal large amounts of state property, causing incalculable losses to the people's production and construction endeavors. Especially when he served as Deputy Section Chief of the Management Section of the Provincial Department of Industry, he more systematically introduced Jin Fade, Qu Dongxiang, and Mao Huajin to work in the Management Section. Jin Fade was put in charge of accounting and finance, Qu Dongxiang was put in charge of procurement and warehousing, and Mao Huajin was put in charge of procurement and inspection. The Management Section, one of the most important departments of the Department of Industry and Commerce, was completely controlled by this group of embezzlers, who wantonly stole state assets from all aspects. The masses called them the "Four King Kongs" of embezzlers in Guizhou. At the same time, Li also colluded with unscrupulous merchants from other regions such as Guangzhou, Hankou, Liuzhou, Shanghai, and Kunming, forming a large embezzlement network. At Li's recommendation, the unscrupulous merchant Zhang Zizhen (Li's friend) was appointed as the director of the Shanghai Office of the Supply and Marketing Section. In fact, Zhang Zizhen was Li Yuquan's agent for engaging in corruption and malpractice. According to preliminary understanding, Li Yuquan's criminal behavior in stealing state property is extremely serious and shocking: (1) Converting public property into private gain and directly stealing state property. According to extremely incomplete statistics, this has amounted to more than one billion yuan in the past two years. For example, in March 1950, Li "entrusted" Wang Baomin (son of a private merchant, currently working at the Xingren Central Branch of the People's Bank) to clean up the Dongshan warehouse, instructing Wang to take the opportunity to modify the accounts. Li then issued a bill of lading in the name of the Supply and Marketing Section, using Zhang Zizhen and Wang Runsheng (illegal merchants) as the front, and Li Guiqing (Li's younger brother, illegal merchant) and Zhang Jingzhai to withdraw 13 tons of potassium chlorate from the Dongshan warehouse. Together with another incident, a total of 13.8 tons of potassium chlorate were stolen and sold, with a value of more than 400 million yuan. Another incident involved the continuous theft and sale of six truckloads of state-owned matches (180 boxes per truck), stealing state property worth 172.8 million yuan. (2) Establishing private businesses and stealing large amounts of state assets. The "Liancheng Firm" near Tongxiangtai in Guiyang City has been solely owned and operated by Li Yuquan since 1950, with his younger brother Li Guiqing serving as manager. It is an agency for Li's large-scale theft of state property. For example, in 1950, Li purchased more than 380,000 jin of tobacco leaves from the Provincial Department of Industry and Mining in the name of the firm, using methods such as receiving advance payments, delivering goods after a period, falsely reporting accounts, raising the original purchase price, falsely reporting losses, and raising the grade of tobacco leaves, stealing more than 100 million yuan of state property. The amount of state property he stole when colluding with Guiyang City's "Baiquan Firm" and "China Service Center" to purchase oil (including gasoline, engine oil, tung oil, vegetable oil, and alcohol), machinery materials, and raw materials is even larger. The fact that the masses call the "Liancheng Firm" the "Second Transportation and Marketing Section" shows how serious their theft behavior has become! (3) Under the guise of "proxy purchase," Li further used his position to frequently engage in his own speculative activities with public funds. For example, in 1950, Long Tianshi, manager of the Kunming Match Company, remitted more than 25 million yuan to purchase raw materials. Li used the excuse of "storing" it with the cashier of the accounting section, and lent it to private individuals, charging interest for six days. The Changsha Match Factory remitted 20 million yuan to repay the Guizhou Match Factory's debt for red phosphorus, but Li deposited it in the Bank of Communications, saying it was "unrelated to public funds," and embezzled it for private use. (4) Li's criminal activities of using his position to steal state commercial intelligence and engage in speculation and profiteering have caused huge losses to the state. During his tenure in the Management Section, there were frequent long-distance telephone calls from private individuals in Kunming, Shanghai, and Liuzhou; or private representatives contacted the Supply and Marketing Section, stealing and exposing state commercial information from all aspects. The embezzlement network he organized used this information to engage in speculative activities, and all expenses were reimbursed from public accounts. Li also told his younger brother Li Guiqing about this commercial information at any time to make huge profits.

At the end of last year, Li Yuquan went to the countryside to participate in land reform. The judicial organs of the Provincial People's Government have recently sent people to arrest him.

Jin Fade, one of the "Four King Kongs," although exposed by the masses in the anti-corruption movement, not only did not confess his criminal facts, but also undermined the development of the movement in various ways. Like Li Yuquan, Jin Fade is also a giant thief who steals state property. (1) Directly stealing state property. In August 1950, the Guizhou Provincial Department of Industry and Commerce entrusted the Huainan Transportation Company to transport tobacco to Liuzhou. Jin Fade, on the grounds that the transported tobacco was moldy, deducted 8 million yuan from the Huainan Company's transportation fees as compensation, and embezzled it all for himself. When handling the supply and marketing of raw materials and finished products for the Guizhou Tobacco Factory, he transferred the losses to the tobacco factory's account on the one hand, and recovered the cash on the other; when the market price of each dan of tobacco had been sold for 600,000 yuan, he still recorded it at 50,000 yuan per dan. (2) Stealing state funds, colluding with unscrupulous merchants, and engaging in corruption and malpractice. In August 1950, he acquired tobacco leaves for 4 billion yuan. When each dan was 300,000 yuan, the higher authorities urged him to seize the opportunity to purchase (not that the goods could not be bought), but Jin embezzled the funds for private gain, causing the state property to lose 1 billion yuan. In June of the same year, he colluded with Xie Mengping, an accountant from the Trial Section, and Huang Wenqi, a clerk from the Management Section, to use public funds to buy 10 pounds of saccharin from a merchant surnamed He at a low price, and resell it to the public at a high price, making a profit of 3 million yuan; in September of the same year, he used the same method to purchase 20 cans of vanilla, making a profit of 1.4 million yuan. (3) Using his position to steal state commercial information. Jin twice telegraphed Xiang Rongqing, the former director of the Chongqing Office of the Supply and Marketing Section, to purchase saccharin and transport it to Guiyang for sale to the Management Section using a fake "Xie Shiming" account. The examples cited above are only a very small part of Jin Fade's embezzlement and theft of state property. The amount of state property Jin embezzled and stole, and the losses he caused to state property, cannot be calculated at present. Jin's methods of concealing these criminal activities are: 1. Confusing accounts: Using a "column-style" cash book to deliberately separate bank deposits from cash on hand, making it impossible for the cashier to know the amount of cash on hand and bank deposits. 2. Threatening and enticing, building relationships, and dragging others into the water: When a unit sent someone to the department to check the accounts, they believed that the accounting of the section was mostly not in compliance with regulations and hoped to correct it. After the auditors left, Jin Fade said to the staff of the Trial Section: "Stand firm and don't be someone else's tail." When Yang Rui, an accountant from the Department of Industry and Commerce, went to the Guizhou Tobacco Factory to check the accounts, Jin told Yang in advance: "If there is a problem, come back and discuss it." The many embezzlement events that Xie Mengping, an accountant from the Trial Section, has confessed to this time were mostly caused by Jin's enticement. 3. Excluding people outside the embezzlement ring from participating in the work of the Trial Section. 4. Accumulating more than a thousand invoices before handing them over to the staff for review, making it impossible for them to get started. Other methods include deceiving superiors and falsely reporting losses.

Due to his repeated embezzlement, Jin Fade adopted a stubborn resistance and sabotage attitude from the beginning towards the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. In the early stages of studying documents, he initially talked about ancient and modern times at discussion meetings, shifting the focus and not seriously taking the lead in launching the movement in the section; later, at discussion meetings, he winked and stepped on the feet of Xie Mengping, who was colluding with him in embezzlement, using various suggestive methods to prevent Xie from confessing the facts of embezzlement. He also wrote three anonymous letters to Xie Mengping, instructing Xie to come to his home to discuss reporting the amount of embezzlement that had already been revealed by others. The criminal was arrested on January 14 and is being punished according to law. (Yefeng, Zhu Qin)

    贵州省人民政府司法机关下令  
    逮捕大贪污犯李玉?金法棣  
    李犯两年直接盗窃国家财产十几亿元
    【本报讯】经广大群众积极检举和上级批准，贵州省人民政府司法机关下令逮捕两个罪大恶极的大贪污分子——省工业厅经理科副科长李玉?，会审科副科长金法棣。
    李犯玉?在国民党反动统治时期，曾任贵州火柴厂经理。解放后，他被留用在省工矿处供销科任科长。到达工作岗位第一天起，他便组织贪污集团，有计划地布置贪污网，化公为私，私设商行，勾结外埠奸商，营私舞弊，盗窃了大量的国家财产，并且使人民的生产建设事业受到不可计算的损失。尤其是在省工业厅经理科任副科长时，他更有计划地介绍金法棣、瞿栋祥、毛华瑾在经理科供职。由金法棣掌握会计财务，瞿栋祥掌握采购、仓库，毛华瑾作采购收验。工商厅重要部门之一的经理科，便被这一批贪污分子完全操纵，从各方面肆意盗窃国家资财。群众称他们为贵州贪污分子中的“四大金刚”。同时，李犯又和广州、汉口、柳州、上海、昆明等外埠奸商勾结，构成了一个大的贪污网。在李犯介绍下，奸商张子祯（李的朋友）便被委为供销科驻上海办事处主任。事实上张子祯是李玉?营私舞弊的代理人。仅据初步了解，李玉?盗窃国家财产的罪恶行为是极端严重和惊人的：（一）化公为私，直接盗取国家财产，仅据极不完全的材料统计，两年来已达十余亿元。例如一九五零年三月，李犯“委托”王保民（私商之子，现在人民银行兴仁中心支行工作）清理东山仓库时，令王趁机将账目修改，李犯即以供销科名义发出提单，用张子祯、王润生（不法商人）出名，由李桂清（李犯之弟、不法商人）和张敬斋到东山仓库提走氯酸钾十三吨。连同另外一次，共盗卖氯酸钾十三吨八，价值在四亿元以上。另一次是连续盗卖国家火柴六车（每车一百八十大箱），盗窃国家财产一亿七千二百八十万元。（二）私设商行，大量盗窃国家资财。贵阳市铜像台附近之“联成行”，从一九五零年起，即由李玉?独资经营，他弟弟李桂清任经理，是李犯大量盗窃国家财产的机关。如李犯以该行名义，于一九五零年代省工矿处购烟叶三十八万多斤，利用先领款、隔期交货，虚报假账、抬高原购价格，虚报损耗，抬高烟叶等级等办法，就盗窃国家财产一亿元以上。他勾结贵阳市“百全行”、“中华服务所”代购油料（包括汽油、机油、桐油、菜油和酒精）、机料和原料时，从中盗窃的国家财产的数字则更大。从群众称“联成行”为“第二运销科”这句话来看，就可以想见他们的盗窃行为已达到何等严重的程度！（三）在“代购”的名目下，李犯更利用职权经常以公款进行自己的投机活动。如一九五零年，昆明火柴公司经理龙天视汇款二千五百余万元买原料，李犯藉口“存放”到会计科出纳那里，而放债给私人，六天本利对付。长沙火柴厂汇来付还贵州火柴厂赤磷的欠款二千万元，李犯却存到交通银行，说“与公款无关”，侵吞为私有。（四）李犯利用职权窃取国家商业情报，进行投机倒把的罪恶活动，更使国家受到了巨大损失。在经理科任职过程中，随时都有由昆明、上海、柳州等地的私人长途电话来往；或以私人代表供销科进行联系，从各方面盗取与暴露国家商情，他所组织的贪污网便据此进行投机活动，一切费用都由公账报销。李犯还把这些商情随时告诉其弟李桂清，牟取暴利。
    去年年底，李犯玉?下乡参加土地改革。日前省人民政府司法机关已派人前往逮捕。
    “四大金刚”之一金法棣，在反贪污运动中，虽经群众检举，但他不仅不坦白他的罪恶事实，并多方破坏运动的开展。和李犯玉?一样，金犯法棣也是盗取国家财产的巨贼。（一）直接盗窃国家财产。一九五零年八月，贵州省工商厅托淮南运输行运烟到柳州，金犯法棣以所运烟发霉，扣淮南行运费八百万元作赔偿费，全私吞为己有。在代办贵州烟厂原料、成品供销时，一面以损耗转入烟厂账内，一面又收回现金；市价每担烟已售六十万元时，仍以五万元一担入账。（二）盗窃国家资金，勾结奸商，营私舞弊。一九五零年八月以四十亿元收购烟叶，每担三十万元时，上级催他抓紧时机购买（并非买不到货），但金因挪用该款项营私，使国家财产损失十亿元。同年六月，他伙同会审科会计谢孟平、经理科科员黄文棋，利用公款，低价收购何姓商人十磅糖精，高价转售给公家，从中渔利三百万元；同年九月，用同样方法套购凡尼拉二十听，渔利一百四十万元。（三）利用职权，盗取国家商情。金犯曾两次电告前供销科重庆办事处主任项荣卿，以伪造的“谢世明”户头出款购买糖精运到贵阳售给经理科。以上举的例子，只是金法棣贪污、盗窃国家财产极小的一部分。金犯贪污、盗窃国家的财产及其招来国家财产的损失，目前尚无法统计。金犯掩饰这些罪恶活动的方法是1、混乱账目：用“专栏式”现金簿，将银行存款与库存现金故意不分，使出纳人员无从获知库存现金及银行存款数字。2、威胁利诱，拉拢关系，拖人下水：某单位派员来厅查账时，认为该科账务处理多不合规定，希望更正；金犯法棣俟查账人员走后，就对会审科承办人员说：“要站稳立场，不要做别人的尾巴。”工商厅会计杨锐赴贵州烟厂查账时，金犯事先对杨说：“如有问题，回来商量。”会审科会计谢孟平这次已坦白的贪污事件，多是被金犯拉拢所致。3、排斥贪污集团以外的人参加会审科工作。4、各项单据都积压至千余张后，才交给承办人员审核，使他无从下手。其他还有欺瞒上级，伪报亏累等办法。
    金犯法棣由于贪污累累，对待反贪污浪费、反官僚主义运动，一开始便采取顽强抵制、破坏的态度。在学习文件初期，他起初在讨论会上谈古论今，转移目标，不认真带头在科内开展这一运动；后来在讨论会上对伙同贪污人员谢孟平挤眉弄眼、嗫嘴踩脚，用各种暗示办法，制止谢坦白贪污事实。他并三次写不具名信给谢孟平，嘱谢到他家里，商量报出已经被别人揭发的贪污数字。该犯已于一月十四日就捕，正依法惩办中。  （野风、朱秦）
