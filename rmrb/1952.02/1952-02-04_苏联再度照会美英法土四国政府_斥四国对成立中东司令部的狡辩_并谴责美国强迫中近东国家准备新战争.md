(Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd dispatch from Moscow based on TASS report): Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko delivered a note on January 28th to the diplomatic envoys of the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey in the Soviet Union. The note refuted the justifications of the four countries regarding the establishment of the Middle East Command.

The Soviet government's note to the United States stated that the U.S. government's note to the Soviet Union on December 19, 1951, attempted to justify the purpose of organizing the Middle East Command by claiming it was necessary to establish a voluntary joint defense organization to ensure the security of the Middle East region. It also claimed it was to assist the countries in the region in maintaining and consolidating their independence and freedom.

The Soviet note refuted this hypocritical explanation. The note pointed out that the Middle East Command is not a voluntary joint defense organization, but one that the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey are forcing upon the Middle Eastern countries. The countries of the Near and Middle East are not threatened by any country, and the proposal to establish the Middle East Command was not initiated by them. Some countries in the Middle East are still under military occupation today, with aggressor countries infringing upon their national sovereignty and continuing to occupy them. The Anglo-American plan for the Middle East Command not only does not stipulate the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Middle East and Near East, allowing these countries to achieve genuine independence and freedom, but also allows the armies of other aggressor countries to be stationed on the territories of these countries. Therefore, the so-called "assistance" to these countries "to maintain and consolidate their independence and freedom" is simply a mockery.

The U.S. government's note insisted that the establishment of the Middle East Command was based on the right of self-defense stipulated in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. The Soviet note refuted this by stating that no country in the Middle East and Near East is currently under attack; what exists are the actions of British troops in Egypt, supported by the United States. Therefore, invoking the United Nations Charter is merely an attempt to expand plans for preparing a war of aggression under the guise of the United Nations flag. The note revealed that the Middle East Command plan is a further development of the aggressive plans of the United States, Britain, and France in the Middle East, attempting to force the countries of the Middle East and Near East to submit to their adventurous goal of preparing for another world war.

The Soviet note reiterated the Soviet government's attitude toward the aggressive plan to establish the Middle East Command in a region not far from the Soviet border and declared once again that the U.S. government and the governments of other initiators of this plan should be responsible for the situation that may arise from the implementation of this plan.

    苏联再度照会美英法土四国政府  
    斥四国对成立中东司令部的狡辩  
    并谴责美国强迫中近东国家准备新战争
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部副部长葛罗米柯在一月二十八日把苏联政府驳斥美、英、法、土四国对成立中东司令部问题的狡辩的照会，递交给美、英、法、土四国驻苏外交使节。
    苏联政府给美国的照会说：美国政府一九五一年十二月十九日给苏联的照会，企图为组织中东司令部的目的进行辩解，硬说这是由于有建立自愿参加的联合防务组织以保障中东地区安全的必要；也是为了援助这个地区的国家，以保持并巩固它们的独立和自由。
    苏联的照会驳斥了这种虚伪的解释。照会指出：中东司令部不是什么自愿组织的联合防务组织，而是美、英、法、土四国强迫中东国家接受的。近东和中东各国并没有受到任何国家的威胁，成立中东司令部的建议并不是它们主动提出的。中东的某些国家，直到今天都仍然处在军事占领的情况中，侵略国侵犯它们的国家主权，继续占领着它们。英美的中东司令部计划不但没有规定从中东和近东撤走一切外国军队，使这些国家能得到真正的独立和自由，反而要让其他侵略国家的军队也得以进驻这些国家的领土。因此，所谓“援助”这些国家“以保持和巩固它们的独立和自由”，简直是一种嘲笑。
    美国政府的照会硬说成立中东司令部是根据联合国宪章第五十一条所规定的自卫权利的。苏联的照会予以驳斥说：中东和近东没有一个国家目前受到攻击，有的只是美国支持下的英国军队在埃及的行动。因此援引联合国宪章，只是企图在联合国旗帜掩盖之下扩大准备侵略战争的计划而已。照会揭露了中东司令部计划是美、英、法三国侵略中东计划的进一步发展，企图强迫中东和近东各国屈从它们准备另一次世界大战的冒险目的。
    苏联的照会在重申苏联政府对于在距离苏联国境不远的地区成立中东司令部的侵略计划的态度，并再度声明：美国政府和这个计划的其他发起国政府应对因实施这种计划所可能引起的局势负责。
