Why We Love Hugo's Works
Mao Dun

Romain Rolland, Barbusse, Balzac, Maupassant, Flaubert, Hugo… these giants of the French literary scene are familiar to us Chinese, and we love them very much.

Hugo became known to the Chinese people about fifty years ago; his masterpiece "Les Misérables" (i.e., "The Miserable World") was introduced slightly later than Rousseau's "The Social Contract." This was translated in classical Chinese (at that time, most translations were still in classical Chinese), and it was an abridged translation. Later, the poet Su Manshu planned to translate this masterpiece completely into vernacular Chinese, but due to the poet's early death, he did not complete this work. This was also almost forty years ago. In these forty years, not only did "Les Misérables" have a new complete translation, but Hugo's other works have also been successively translated into better versions—that is to say, one work often has two or more translations. For example, "Notre-Dame de Paris" has two translations, and the novels "Ninety-Three" and the play "Angelo, Tyrant of Padua" are the same.

It should be pointed out that during the ten years after the Chinese May Fourth Movement, although Chinese young intellectuals who loved literature and art paid the most attention to the realistic literature of Western Europe—especially the works of critical realism—in order to study the historical development of European literary trends, they also paid great interest and attention to the works of the major figures of Romanticism. During this period, the translated works of Hugo, in addition to the new translations of "Les Misérables" and so on, also included the plays "Lucrèce Borgia", "Hernani" and "Lucrezia Borgia." It can be said that, except for poetry (because poetry is the most difficult to translate), most of Hugo's important works (novels and plays) have been translated into Chinese. Because of this, not only have Hugo's works been translated in China, but many papers studying Hugo have also been published. Hugo, like Balzac, Barbusse, Romain Rolland, and others, is enthusiastically loved by our writers and the vast number of young intellectuals who love literature and art.

But this does not mean that Hugo has a large number of fans in China only because he was the leader of the 19th-century French Romantic movement. No! In the eyes of general readers, it is not important to which school of literature a writer belongs; the standard for general readers to like or dislike a work lies in the ideological content of the work. What does the work support, and what does it oppose? What kind of characters does the work praise, and what kind of characters does it hate and curse? All of this is the standard by which general readers like or dislike a certain work. In Hugo's works, we Chinese general readers see that what the author supports and praises is exactly what they support and praise, and what the author opposes, hates, and curses is exactly what they want to oppose, hate, and curse. This is the fundamental reason why Hugo's works enjoy a high reputation in China.

Can we be indifferent to the life experience of Jean Valjean (the protagonist of "Les Misérables")? Can we not see from his tragic and turbulent life how the so-called laws in that unreasonable society are reversing right and wrong and confusing black and white? There is a perceptive old saying in China: "He who steals a hook is executed, he who steals a state becomes a prince." This is the most thorough understanding that the Chinese people have gained from their long-term struggle experience of the feudal ruling class's set of grand laws for oppressing the people. Jean Valjean, this "hook stealer," has been persecuted by the laws made by those "state stealers" throughout his life (even after he has repeatedly remade himself)! How kind, how righteous and courageous, how generous is this "hook stealer" in Hugo's pen; and how despicable, selfish, insidious, and cruel is Javert, the police officer who represents the law! It is inconceivable that the Chinese people who love truth, uphold justice, and are strong and brave would not show infinite love for Jean Valjean like the author!

Can we not express our sincere respect for Gilliatt's (the protagonist of "Toilers of the Sea") noble character of preferring to sacrifice his own happiness to fulfill the happiness of the one he loves? Can we not admire Hernani (the protagonist of the play "Hernani") who strongly pursues noble ideals—pursuing a more reasonable and better life? Can we bear to laugh at the naive—almost childish—generosity of Hernani, who has "noble ideals" and "passionate feelings"?

The Chinese people sympathize with these characters in Hugo's works, and the Chinese people also see the advantages and limitations of these characters in their own struggle experience. Absorbing its excellent progressive elements, and critically abandoning its elements that do not meet the needs of the times and do not meet the realities of China—this is the Chinese people's attitude towards world culture. This is the case with Hugo, and the same is true for the achievements of other world cultural celebrities. To say that the Chinese people reject all Western culture is nonsense. It is a despicable means of deliberately creating rumors and instigating discord. The Chinese people are willing to exchange experiences with the people of all countries in the world in culture, and to achieve further mutual understanding through cultural exchanges. We cherish our country's excellent cultural traditions, and at the same time, we cherish the excellent cultural traditions of other nations. We celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of a great writer like Hugo with the same enthusiasm as the French people!

### 为什么我们喜爱雨果的作品

    为什么我们喜爱雨果的作品
    茅盾
    罗曼罗兰、巴比塞、巴尔札克、莫泊桑、佛洛贝尔、雨果……这些法国文坛上的巨人，我们中国人对他们是熟悉的，而且是很爱好的。
    雨果为中国人所知，约在五十年前；他的杰作“哀史”（即“悲惨世界”）略后于卢梭的“民约论”被介绍过来。这是用文言译的（那时候，一般译作，还以文言为多），而且是节译。稍后，诗人苏曼殊打算用白话把这部巨著完全翻译出来，可是，由于这位诗人的早死，他这工作没有完成。这也是差不多四十年前的事了。在这四十年中，不但“哀史”有了新的全译本，雨果的其他著作也陆续有了比较好的译本，——这就是说，一部著作常有两种以上的译本。例如“巴黎圣母院”就有先后两个译本，小说“九十三年”和剧本“昂芝洛”亦然。
    应当指出：在中国“五四”运动以后的十余年间，中国爱好文艺的青年知识分子所最留心研究的虽然是西欧的现实主义的文学——特别是批判的现实主义的作品，然而为了钻研欧洲文艺思潮的历史的发展，对于浪漫主义诸大家的作品也是寄以颇大的兴趣和注意的。这一时期所翻译的雨果的作品，除了“哀史”等等的新译本而外，又有“绿依·伯拉”“欧那尼”、“吕克累斯·波吉亚”这些剧本。可以说，除了诗（因为诗是最难翻译的），雨果的重要作品（小说和剧本）大都有了中文的译本。正因其如此，所以在中国不但翻译了雨果的作品，也发表过不少研究雨果的论文。雨果是和巴尔札克、巴比塞、罗曼罗兰等等同样地为我们的作家以及爱好文艺的广大知识青年所热烈喜爱的。
    但这并不是说，雨果之所以在中国拥有广大的爱好者，只因为他是十九世纪法国浪漫主义运动的领袖人物。不是的！在一般读者的眼中，一个作家之属于文学上的那一派别，是不关重要的；一般读者喜爱或者不喜爱的标准是在于作品的思想内容。作品所拥护者是什么，所反对者又是什么？作品所歌颂者是何等样的人物，所憎恨诅咒者又是何等样的人物？这一切，才是一般读者对于某一作品喜爱或不喜爱的标准。在雨果的作品中，我们中国的一般读者看见了作者所拥护所歌颂者正是他们所拥护与歌颂的，看见了作者所反对所憎恨诅咒的，也正是他们所要反对、憎恨与诅咒的。这就是雨果的作品所以在中国享有盛誉的根本的原因。
    难道我们对于若望·法尔强（“哀史”中的主人公）的一生遭遇会漠然无动于衷么？难道我们从他的惨酷而颠沛的生活中不能看出那不合理的社会中的不合理的所谓法律是怎样颠倒是非、混淆黑白的？我们中国有一句警辟的古话：“窃钩者诛，窃国者侯。”这是中国人民在长期的奋斗经验中对于封建统治阶级的那一套压迫人民的堂皇的法律所获得的最透彻的认识。若望·法尔强这个“窃钩者”，就是终身（甚至在他屡次重新做人以后）受着那些“窃国者”所制定的法律的迫害！雨果笔下的这个“窃钩者”多么仁慈，多么好义勇为，多么慷慨；而那个代表法律的警长耶凡乐又是多么卑鄙、自私、阴险而残酷！不能设想酷爱真理、拥护正义、坚强而勇敢的中国人民是不会像作者一样对于若望·法尔强寄以无限的热爱的！
    难道我们对于吉利亚（“海上劳工”的主人公）的宁可牺牲了自己的幸福以成全他的所爱者的幸福——这样的高贵的品性，能够不表示由衷的敬爱么？难道我们对于那坚强地追求高贵的理想——追求更合理更美好生活的欧那尼（剧本“欧那尼”的主人公）能够不赞美么？难道我们忍心嘲笑这个具有“高贵的理想”和“热烈的感情”的欧那尼的那种天真的——几乎近于幼稚的慷慨大度的行为么？
    中国人民同情于雨果作品中的这些人物，中国人民也从自己的斗争经验中看出了这些人物的优点及其时代的限制性。吸收其优秀的进步的成分，而批判地舍弃其不合时代需要、不合中国现实的成分，——这就是中国人民对于世界文化的态度。对于雨果如此，对于其他世界文化名人的成就也是如此。说什么中国人民排拒一切西方文化，那是无稽的谰言。那是别有居心的造谣挑拨的卑劣的手段。中国人民愿意和世界各国人民在文化上交换经验，并通过文化交流而达到进一步的互相了解。我们珍视本国的优秀的文化传统，同时也珍视其他民族的优秀的文化传统。我们对于像雨果那样伟大的作家的一百五十年诞生纪念，是和法国人民同样地抱着热烈的心情的！
