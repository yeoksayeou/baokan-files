    Suzhou City Central District Revolutionary Families Report Happy Living Conditions

    Respected Chairman Mao: We are the revolutionary families of the Central District of Suzhou City. Under your wise leadership, our lives are guaranteed and are getting better every day. More importantly, we have glory.

    Among nearly 900 families in our district, 205 people have found employment through the introduction of the People's Government, and each person can support one to three people. We have 483 families who have received "Preferential Treatment Certificates for Medical Care," and 27 families with special difficulties can receive long-term living allowances. Among our children, 523 can have their tuition fees reduced or waived. Through land reform, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and the Resist America, Aid Korea movement, our awareness has been raised. Among us, 491 have become cadres in various grassroots organizations, and another 127 have become activists in various work areas. Last July and August, we organized and established a cotton weaving factory and a medical device factory, and they have been very successful. Around New Year's Day this year, people from all walks of life came to comfort us, give us gifts, hold joint celebrations, seminars, etc. We have received the respect and love of people from all walks of life.

    Respected Chairman Mao: We know that our happiness and glory are all brought to us by you. In order to express our gratitude to you, the People's Government, and people from all walks of life, we guarantee: (1) Respond to the call for increasing production and practicing economy, not simply relying on the People's Government for relief, but actively seeking production opportunities and overcoming life's difficulties through self-reliance. Cherish our factory even more and resolutely do a good job in it. (2) Write letters to our children and husbands at the front lines regularly, encouraging them to study hard and kill more enemies. (3) Exemplarily abide by the various policies and decrees of the People's Government. Take the lead actively in various tasks and strive for glory upon glory.

    Ethnic Minority Students of Wuding Middle School in Yunnan Province Thank the People's Government for Relief

    Dear Chairman Mao: We are several ethnic minority students from Wuding Middle School in Yunnan Province. Because you led the people of all ethnic groups in our country to stand up, and the People's Governments at all levels correctly implemented your great ethnic policy, we received unprecedented care in this cold season - the Southwest District Nationalities Affairs Commission issued 900,000 yuan in relief funds for ethnic minorities, and the school made a cotton quilt for each of us. We really cannot express or thank you enough for your great kindness! We will never forget you in our lifetime!

    We recall that in the past, our ancestors lived a life of hardship and misery on the mountaintops and in the snow. For thousands of years, starvation, freezing to death, suffering to death, or being forced to death were our outcomes. We lived lives worse than cattle and horses from generation to generation.

    Chairman Mao: You have rescued us to the shore. Only you care about us in your heart and treat us as human beings; only you have warmed our always-cold hearts. Now you have given us this quilt, which not only warms a few of us, but also makes all our ethnic minority compatriots feel warm.

    We guarantee to you: We must study hard at school, learn our skills well, and resolutely take on the glorious posts of national construction and national defense; when we return to the countryside, we must vigorously carry out propaganda, even to the deaf and dumb, we must explain your words to them clearly. Our cheers resound through the sky, hoping to send them to your ears with the wind.

    感谢毛主席对军属和少数民族的关怀
    苏州市中区革命家属报告愉快的生活情形
    敬爱的毛主席：我们是苏州市中区的革命家属，在您英明的领导下，我们的生活有了保障，而且一天比一天好起来。更重要的是，我们有了光荣。
    我们全区近九百户家属中，有二百零五人经人民政府介绍，有了职业，每人可以维持一人到三人的生活。我们有四百八十三户领到了“诊疗优待证”，二十七户特殊困难的可以长期领取生活补助费。我们的子弟中，有五百二十三人上学可以减免学杂费用等。经过土地改革、镇压反革命、抗美援朝运动，我们的觉悟提高了。我们中有四百九十一人成了各种基层组织中的干部，还有一百二十七人在各种工作中成了积极分子。去年七、八月间，我们组织起来设立了棉织品工厂和医疗器械工厂，并且办得很有成绩。今年元旦前后，各界人民向我们慰问、送礼，和我们开联欢会、座谈会等等，我们受到各界人民的尊敬和爱护。
    敬爱的毛主席：我们知道，我们的幸福和光荣，都是您带给我们的。为了表示感谢您、感谢人民政府、感谢各界人民，我们保证：（一）响应增产节约的号召，不单纯依赖人民政府救济，要积极找寻生产门路，自力克服生活困难。更加爱护我们的工厂，并坚决搞好它。（二）经常给在前方的子女、丈夫写信，鼓励他们好好学本领，多杀敌人。（三）模范地遵守人民政府的各种政策、法令。在各种工作中积极带头，争取光荣加光荣。

    云南省武定中学少数民族学生感谢人民政府的救济
    亲爱的毛主席：我们是云南省武定中学的几个少数民族学生。由于您领导我国各族人民翻了身，各级人民政府正确地执行了您的伟大的民族政策，我们在这严寒的季节里，得到从来没有过的照顾——西南区民族事务委员会发下少数民族救济费九十万元，由学校替我们每人做了一条棉被子。对于您的伟大恩情，我们真是说不完、谢不尽！我们一辈子也忘不了您！
    我们回想起：从前我们的祖先，在山头上，在积雪里，过着艰苦万状的生活。千百年来，饿死、冻死、苦死或者被逼死，乃是我们的结果。我们一代一代地过着牛马还不如的生活。
    毛主席：您把我们拯救到岸上来了。只有您才把我们放在心里，当作人看；只有您温暖了我们一向冰冷的心。现在你给了我们这条被子，它不只使我们几个人得到温暖，而是使我们所有少数民族同胞的身上都发出了热气。
    我们向您提出保证：在学校里一定要好好学习，学好本事，坚决走上祖国建设及保卫祖国的光荣岗位；回到农村里，要大力展开宣传，那怕是对聋子哑子，也一定要把您的话向他交代明白。我们的欢呼声响彻云霄，希望能随风送到您的耳里。
