    Further criticizing right-leaning thought inside and outside the Party remains a decisive issue in the current anti-corruption movement in Wuhan. Although the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuhan Municipal-level Organs Thrift Inspection Committee have initially criticized right-leaning thought inside and outside the Party, although the number of "tigers" caught in some units has slightly increased, and although the erroneous argument that "there are no tigers here" has gradually decreased, some cadres (including some leading cadres) still harbor right-leaning thought. Without thoroughly eradicating this right-leaning thought, the battle to encircle and suppress major corrupt elements will inevitably be bogged down and unable to achieve complete victory.

    As of the 14th, quite a few major corrupt elements have been found in Wuhan's municipal-level organs and factories distributed in various districts. However, compared with the actual situation, the number of major corrupt elements captured in many units, especially in the financial and economic systems, is unsatisfactory. Taking the trade system as an example, the Wuhan Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce and its nine affiliated specialized companies have so far only caught very few major "tigers." The Administration itself has not caught even one.

    The main reason why these organs and units cannot achieve significant results is that some leading cadres have not yet recognized the serious harm of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, nor have they recognized that the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is a serious class struggle.

    Yang Guoqing, an engineer from the Municipal Bureau of Industry and former manager of the Wuhan Chemical Plant, is a major corrupt element. The workers of the chemical plant requested that he be transferred back to the plant for investigation. Jiang Ping, director of the office of the Municipal Bureau of Industry, wanted to transfer Yang back to the Bureau for "introspection," advising the workers "not to go too far." Later, opposed by Sun Yunzhang, secretary of the Second District Party Committee, and the Chinese Communist Party branch of the chemical plant, Yang was transferred back to the chemical plant, and it was quickly discovered that Yang had accepted bribes of as much as 110 million yuan in material procurement alone.

    Some units have not promptly and decisively replaced leading cadres with corrupt and fraudulent behavior, but have instead allowed such people to lead the anti-corruption struggle, resulting in the anti-corruption struggle shifting its target or stagnating. For example, Xu Xiongbo, deputy section chief of the Industry and Commerce Guidance Section of the Wuhan Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, also works in the preparatory committee of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce. He is surrounded by a group of unscrupulous merchants in the Federation, shields the unscrupulous merchant Wang Yuanzhi from tax evasion, and engages in other illegal and undisciplined activities. But to this day, the Wuhan Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce is still delaying handling the matter, causing dissatisfaction among the masses in the Bureau. Zhu Naicheng, manager of the Municipal Native Produce Company, colludes with Fu Daoxing, manager of the Xingshengxiang Trust Import and Export Firm, who is an unscrupulous merchant. Fu Daoxing sent his confidants, such as Nie Fuxun, to the Native Produce Company, and Zhu Naicheng appointed Nie Fuxun as the head of the medicinal materials team, turning the entire medicinal materials team into a "branch" of Xingshengxiang. Xingshengxiang used the medicinal materials deposited in its warehouse by the Native Produce Company as collateral to the Bank of China, fraudulently obtaining large amounts of loans and foreign exchange; Nie Fuxun and others stole economic intelligence; Zhu Naicheng directly traded with Xingshengxiang without going through the business section. They colluded with each other, causing incalculable losses to state property. The Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce not only did not replace such a corrupt element as Zhu Naicheng, but instead asked him to lead the anti-corruption struggle, believing that his problem should be dealt with after the end of the anti-corruption struggle, resulting in the failure of the anti-corruption movement in the Municipal Native Produce Company to progress.

    Liu Jiqin, manager of the Municipal Petroleum Company and secretary of the company's Chinese Communist Party branch, and Ma Longchi, director of the oil plant, severely suppressed democracy and criticism. They did not mobilize the masses to purge corrupt elements in the Thrift Inspection Committee. The twenty-eight members of the Thrift Inspection Committee did not speak at the meeting, but only listened to Liu Jiqin's speech. Therefore, the progress of the anti-corruption movement in the Petroleum Company was also very slow.

    The slow progress of the anti-corruption struggle in some units of Wuhan's state-owned trade system is inseparable from the right-leaning thought of Wang Guangyuan, director of the Administration for Industry and Commerce. Wang Guangyuan showed an unstable stance in the Hengyang Railway Administration paint case. Although he later made a public self-criticism, he did not truly recognize the harm of right-leaning thought. Therefore, in the anti-corruption struggle, he showed that he was not fierce enough in fighting "tigers" and that the handling of Xu Xiongbo, Zhu Naicheng, and others was not timely or resolute.

    Some leading cadres believe that "if too many are replaced, there will be no one to take over the work." However, in the movement, many cadres who have stood the test, are loyal to the Party, and are loyal to the people have emerged, but they do not see them.

    Feng Rongsen, a corrupt element in the Land Reform Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee, colluded with the contractor He Yitai to engage in corruption and fraud. A inspection team from the Land Reform Committee's Thrift Inspection Committee branch went to He Yitai's home in Wuchang to conduct an inspection. At that time, He Yitai was attending a meeting of the Construction Industry Trade Association and openly resisted the inspection. The unscrupulous merchants of the Trade Association also clamored along with He Yitai. They insulted the inspection team members, saying, "You are revolutionary cadres, you understand the policy, why are you disrupting the meeting?" Some even shouted, "Get out!" The unscrupulous merchants were so rampant, but Diao Xuexun of the Wuchang Office of the Central South, Hubei, and Wuhan Anti-Corruption Joint Committee did not support the inspection team to suppress the arrogance of the unscrupulous merchants, but instead said, "We did not contact them in advance, otherwise it would be easier." "Now the mood of the construction industry is low, if you talk more gently, it will not be like this. Being gentle is not a matter of principle." How can he take on the task of commanding the battle when he is so humble in the face of the unscrupulous merchants' attack? But he is still in charge.

    The anti-corruption struggle in Wuhan is still in its initial stage. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Wuhan Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee have initially criticized right-leaning thought inside and outside the Party. In order to make the anti-corruption struggle take a big step forward and achieve a complete victory, we must continue to expose and criticize right-leaning thought ruthlessly. This is the urgent and important task at present. The leading organs of Wuhan should give it serious attention.

    彻底清除右倾思想是武汉市反贪污斗争前进的关键
    沈石
    进一步批判党内外右倾思想，仍然是武汉市目前反贪污运动中具有决定意义的问题。尽管中共武汉市委员会和武汉市一级机关节约检查委员会已经初步批判了党内外的右倾思想，尽管某些单位捕获的“老虎”的数字已经稍有增加，尽管“这里没有老虎”的错误论调已经日渐减少，但是一部分干部
    （包括某些领导干部）中，仍然存在着右倾思想。不彻底清除这种右倾思想，围剿大贪污犯的战斗必然会拖泥带水，不能获得全胜。
    截至十四日止，武汉市一级机关及分布各区的工厂，已经搜索出不少大贪污分子。但是，和实际情况比较起来，许多单位，特别是财政经济系统所获大贪污犯数字，是不能令人满意的。就贸易系统说，武汉市工商局和所属的九个专业公司，至今仅打住很少大“老虎”。工商局本身则连一只也没有打住。
    这些机关单位所以不能获得重大战果，主要原因是某些领导干部还没有认识到资产阶级猖狂进攻的严重危害性，没有认识到反对贪污浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争，乃是一场严重的阶级斗争。
    市工业局工程师杨国庆，前任武汉化工厂经理，是一个大贪污犯。化工厂的工人要求把他调回工厂来追查。市工业局办公室主任姜萍却要将杨犯调回工业局“反省”，劝工人“不要过份”。后来遭到二区区委书记孙云章及化工厂中共支部的反对，将杨犯调回化工厂，很快就追查出杨犯仅在采购器材中就受贿达一亿一千万元。
    某些单位对于有着贪污舞弊行为的领导干部，没有及时地、果断地予以撤换，反让这样的人来领导反贪污斗争，结果是使反贪污斗争转移目标，或停滞不前。如武汉市工商局工商辅导科副科长许雄白，兼任武汉市工商业联合会筹备委员会的工作，他在工商联为一群奸商所包围，包庇奸商王远志漏税，并有其他违法乱纪的行为。但直到今天，武汉市工商局仍然拖延没有处理，引起该局群众不满。市土产公司经理朱乃成和兴盛祥信托进出口商号的经理、奸商傅道兴勾结。傅道兴将他的亲信聂福训等多人派入土产公司，朱乃成竟把聂福训任为药材组组长，使整个药材组成了兴盛祥的“分号”。兴盛祥号用土产公司寄存于该号仓库的药材向中国银行抵押，骗取大量贷款和外汇；聂福训等盗取经济情报；朱乃成不通过业务科就直接和兴盛祥进行交易。他们狼狈为奸，使国家财产遭受不可计算的损失。像朱乃成这种贪污分子，市工商局不但不予以撤换，反叫他领导反贪污斗争，认为他的问题应该等待反贪污斗争结束以后再处理，结果使得市土产公司的反贪污运动无法进展。
    市石油公司经理兼该公司中共支部书记刘吉琴和油厂主任马龙池，严重地压制民主，压制批评。他们对于节约检查委员会中的贪污分子，不发动群众加以清洗。节约检查委员会的二十八名委员，开会时不发言，光听刘吉琴一个人讲一通完事。因此，石油公司反贪污运动进展也很迟缓。
    武汉市国营贸易系统某些单位反贪污斗争进展缓慢，是和工商局局长王光远的右倾思想分不开的。王光远在衡阳铁路管理局油漆案中，即表现立场不稳。后来虽然作了公开检讨，但并没有真正认识右倾思想的危害性。因此在反贪污斗争中，就表现出打“虎”不猛，对许雄白、朱乃成等处理不及时、不坚决。
    有的领导干部认为“撤换多了，没有人接替工作。”但是，在运动中已经涌现出许多经得起考验、忠实于党、忠实于人民的干部，他们却看不见。
    中南军政委员会土地改革委员会的贪污分子冯荣森和营造商何义泰勾结，贪污舞弊。土地改革委员会节约检查委员会分会派出检查组前往武昌何义泰家中去检查。当时，何义泰正在营造业同业公会开会，竟公开的抗拒检查。同业公会的奸商也跟着何义泰一道叫嚣。他们侮辱检查组人员说：“你们是革命干部，懂得政策，为什么捣乱会场？”有的竟喊：“滚出去！”奸商们猖狂到如此程度，但中南、湖北、武汉反贪污联合委员会武昌办事处的刁学询既不支持检查组，压倒奸商的气焰，反而说：“我们事先没有和他们联系，不然可以容易些。”“现在营造业家情绪低落，你们如果和缓些谈，就不会这样。和缓些并不是立场问题。”在奸商进攻面前，这样低声下气，怎么能担任战斗的指挥工作呢？但他还是担任着。
    武汉市反贪污斗争还在初战阶段，中共武汉市委员会及武汉市节约检查委员会已初步批判了党内外的右倾思想。为了使反贪污斗争大踏步向前迈进，取得彻底的胜利，必须无情地继续揭发和批判右倾思想。这是当前刻不容缓的重要任务。武汉市的领导机关应予以严正的重视。
