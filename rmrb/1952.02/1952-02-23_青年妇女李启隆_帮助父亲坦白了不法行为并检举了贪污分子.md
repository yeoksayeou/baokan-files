    Young Woman Li Qilong
    Helps Her Father Confess His Illegal Activities and Expose Corrupt Elements
    My name is Li Qilong, I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I am a family member of an employee of the Pingxiang Coal Mine Machinery Factory in Jiangxi. I helped my father confess his illegal activities and exposed corrupt elements.

    When the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, my understanding was very vague, and I took a completely indifferent attitude towards the movement. After I attended the League meeting and the "Three-Anti Movement Training Class" organized by the machinery factory, my thinking changed. In the women's association of the machinery factory, I organized a "Women Activists' Three-Anti Movement Study Group." On February 1st, just as we were studying enthusiastically, my father, Li Huazhu, came. He was the boss of a grain store in Pingxiang, and he was flustered and very unnatural at this time. In the evening, he gave me four million yuan and said, "Qilong, this money is for you to take care of the family life. I'm going to run away." I was very surprised, so I asked him why he wanted to run away. He said, "Du Zhongding, a corrupt element of the Pingxiang Salt Company, embezzled and sold more than a hundred dan of salt. Between February and March of 1951, I bought twelve dan from him (each dan weighing one hundred jin), and the price per dan was 30,000 yuan cheaper than the market price. Now that Du Zhongding's matter has come to light, I will go to jail..." I repeatedly explained the government's policy to him, and he was somewhat moved. I further explained to him the principle that he could atone for his crimes by performing meritorious service after confessing, and after hearing this, he said, "I'll wait a few days and then go confess." I knew he still had concerns. I talked to him about some relevant facts and wrote a confession for him, which I sent to the Pingxiang Federation of Industry and Commerce. I also wrote a material for him exposing the corrupt element Du Zhongding, which I sent to the Pingxiang Salt Company. The next day (February 2nd), I sent him back home. After the family knew the situation, they discussed it one after another, and even wanted to stop him from confessing. On the one hand, I explained to my family, and on the other hand, I urged him to go to the Federation of Industry and Commerce, where he confessed to buying the stolen salt from Du Zhongding. On February 3rd, the Federation of Industry and Commerce held a meeting, and the responsible comrade explained that his confession was welcome. At the meeting, in addition to reporting the ideological struggle process of this confession, he also confessed to the illegal act of not fully paying taxes on fifty dan of rice, and guaranteed that he would never do it again in the future. A comrade from the Pingxiang Salt Company came and welcomed him for confessing his crimes and exposing the corrupt element Du Zhongding.

    After my father and I returned home, the whole family looked at me with surprised and happy eyes, and were grateful to me. I said to them: We must study hard in the future, otherwise we will go the wrong way again.

    青年妇女李启隆
    帮助父亲坦白了不法行为并检举了贪污分子
    我叫李启隆，我是青年团员，我是江西萍乡煤矿机厂一个职工的家属。我帮助我父亲坦白了非法行为，并检举了贪污分子。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，我的认识很模糊，对运动抱着毫不关心的态度。我参加了团的会议，又参加了机厂办的“三反运动训练班”，我的思想转变了。我在机厂的妇女会中，组织了一个“妇女积极分子三反运动学习小组”。二月一日，我们正学习得起劲的时候，我父亲李华竹来了。他是萍乡一个粮食店的老板，他这时慌慌张张，很不自然。晚上，他拿了四百万元交给我，并说：“启隆，这点钱给你照顾家庭生活。我要逃走了。”我很奇怪，就追问他为什么要逃走。他说：“萍乡盐业公司贪污分子杜中定盗卖了一百多担盐，一九五一年二、三月间，我买了他十二担（每担一百斤），每担价钱比市价便宜三万元。现在杜中定的事情一发生，我就要坐牢。……”我反覆地向他说明政府的政策，他有三分动心了。我进一步和他讲坦白后可以戴罪立功的道理，他听了以后，便说：“我停几天去坦白好啦。”我知道他还有顾虑。我又和他谈一些有关的事实，并且代他写了一篇坦白书，送到萍乡工商联合会，另外代他写了一篇检举贪污分子杜中定的材料，送到萍乡盐业公司。第二天（二月二日），我送他回到家里，家里人知道情况以后，纷纷议论，甚至要阻止他坦白。我一方面向家里人讲解，一方面催着他到工商联合会，他坦白了收买杜中定的赃盐的事。二月三日，工商联召开大会，负责同志说明他的坦白是值得欢迎的。他在大会上，除了报告这次坦白的思想斗争过程之外，又坦白了曾经有五十担米没有完税的不法行为，并保证今后决不再犯。萍乡盐业公司来了一位同志，对他坦白自己的罪恶并检举贪污分子杜中定表示欢迎。
    我和我父亲回家后，全家人都以又惊奇又欢喜的目光看着我，感激我。我向他们说：今后可要努力学习了，不然又要走错了路。
