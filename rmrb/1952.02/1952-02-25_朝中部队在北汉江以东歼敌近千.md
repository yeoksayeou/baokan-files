Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 24th: Our front-line reporter reports: In a counterattack against Height 662.0 east of the Bukhan River, a certain unit of the Korean and Chinese People's Forces annihilated nearly a thousand enemy soldiers using ingenious tactics, marking a brilliant victory on the Korean battlefield recently. Late on the night of the 14th, a crack night raiding team of our army, treading on accumulated snow, charged onto the steep Height 662.0, using intense automatic gunfire and volleys of hand grenades to annihilate a company of the defending enemy, the Li puppet army's Third Division, within their fortifications. At dawn on the 15th, an enemy battalion rushed to the scene, attempting to retake the lost ridge. While approaching the height, the enemy suffered over a hundred casualties from our sudden artillery fire and retreated. In the following days, the enemy continued to launch multiple counterattacks against this ridge with forces ranging from a platoon to two battalions. Under the intense fire of our army, each enemy attack suffered dozens to hundreds of casualties. Our brave and resourceful army, taking advantage of the victory, continued to counterattack the enemy, annihilating over a hundred enemy soldiers on several unnamed heights west of Height 662.0. On the night of the 18th, the repeatedly battered enemy, with a company-sized force, counterattacked an unnamed height that had just been recovered by our army, and was repelled by us. On the morning of the 19th, the enemy increased their forces to two battalions and launched a fierce attack. After inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, our army defending the mountain temporarily withdrew from the position. Just as the enemy climbed to the top of the mountain, they were again subjected to a fierce artillery bombardment from our army, which killed and wounded more than three hundred enemy soldiers, and our soldiers victoriously retook the position. From the night of the 14th to the night of the 19th, our army, in the battles on Height 662.0 and its vicinity east of the Bukhan River, killed and wounded a total of over nine hundred enemy soldiers.

In other areas of the front, the Korean and Chinese People's Army severely struck invading enemies. On the 18th, more than three hundred enemy soldiers, under the cover of sixteen tanks, attacked two of our army's hilltop positions southeast of Kimhwa, launching seven consecutive assaults, all of which were repelled. Our army killed or wounded over a hundred enemy soldiers and destroyed four enemy tanks. On the 20th, two companies of the U.S. invading army's 45th Division attacked the Chengsan and Chisan-dong areas northwest of Cheorwon, but retreated after suffering more than thirty casualties at the hands of our army.

    【新华社朝鲜前线二十四日电】本社前线记者报道：朝中人民部队某部在反击北汉江以东六六二点零高地的战斗中，用巧妙的战术歼敌近千人，这是最近朝鲜战场上的一个光辉胜利。十四日深夜，我军一支精干的夜袭队踏着积雪，冲上峻峭的六六二点零高地，用炽烈的自动枪火和成批的手榴弹将守敌李伪军第三师的一个连歼灭在工事里。十五日拂晓，敌军一个营匆匆赶来，企图夺回失去的山岭。敌军在向这个高地接近的中途，被我突然发射的炮火杀伤一百多人后退去。在这以后的几天中，敌军曾继续用一个排到两个营的兵力，向这一山岭进行了多次的反扑。在我军严密火力的射击下，敌军的每次进攻都遭到数十人到成百人的伤亡。英勇机智的我军又乘胜继续反击敌人，在六六二点零高地以西的几个无名高地上歼灭敌军一百多人。十八日夜，屡次挨打的敌军以一个连的兵力，向刚被我军收复的一个无名高地反扑，被我击退。十九日晨，敌又增至两个营兵力前来猛攻。守卫在山上的我军在大量杀伤敌人之后，暂时撤离了阵地。敌人刚爬上山头，复遭我军猛烈炮火射击，又毙伤敌军三百余人，我军战士又胜利的夺回阵地。自十四日夜到十九日夜，我军在北汉江以东六六二点零高地及其附近的战斗中，总计打死打伤敌军九百多人。
    在前线其它地方，朝中人民军队严厉地打击了进犯的敌人。十八日，敌军三百多人在十六辆战车掩护下，向金城东南我军两个山头阵地进攻，连续冲锋七次都被击退，我军共毙伤敌军一百多人，击毁敌战车四辆。二十日，美国侵略军第四十五师以两个连兵力，向铁原西北城山、芝山洞地区进犯，被我军杀伤三十多人后溃退。
