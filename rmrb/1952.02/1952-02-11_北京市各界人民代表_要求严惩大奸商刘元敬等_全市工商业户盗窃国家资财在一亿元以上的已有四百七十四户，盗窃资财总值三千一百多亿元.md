(Beijing News Agency) The Third Session of the People's Representatives Conference Consultative Committee and the Municipal People's Government Committee of Beijing held a joint meeting on the 8th to preliminarily exchange opinions on the handling of corruption and theft of state property. A total of sixteen cases were discussed at the meeting. Among them, ten cases involved government staff members using their positions to embezzle and accept bribes, sell state economic intelligence, extort, and suppress whistleblowers, including the cases of Geng Cheng and Sun Quanzhong; six cases involved profiteers bribing officials, evading taxes, cutting corners, stealing and defrauding state property, and stealing state economic intelligence, including the collective theft case of Liu Yuanjing and Wan Xuanzhi.

The meeting began with a report by Liu Ren, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Consultative Committee and Director of the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee, on the progress of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Beijing. So far, 149 major embezzlers have been discovered in various organs, factories, mines, enterprises, and schools throughout the city. Some corrupt elements with serious circumstances who refused to confess or even resisted the movement have been arrested; some government staff members who were corrupt or passively treated the movement have been removed from their positions or suspended from duty for reflection. The movement has fully unfolded and is now "catching big tigers." In the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state property, anti-cutting corners, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement in the business community, 36,000 industrial and commercial households have voluntarily confessed their problems or been reported, accounting for 72 percent of the total number of households. The Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee has now received 160,000 pieces of confession and report materials from industrial and commercial households. According to preliminary statistics, more than 474 industrial and commercial households have been found to have stolen more than 100 million yuan in state assets; among these more than 400 households, the total value of stolen state assets has been verified to reach more than 310 billion yuan. At present, there are still more than 300 inspection teams continuing to conduct inspections among industrial and commercial households. Subsequently, Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Municipal People's Government and Deputy Director of the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee, cited sixteen cases of corruption and theft of state property, requesting everyone to discuss and study them and put forward opinions on how to handle them.

Next, representatives of the Municipal Thrift Inspection Committee and the Municipal People's Procuratorate reported in detail the specific contents of these cases to be dealt with immediately. The heads of the relevant departments present at the meeting accused these major corrupt elements and profiteers of stealing state property and causing serious damage to national construction. The technical personnel who investigated the cases of Liu Yuanjing and Wan Xuanzhi reported the results of the on-site investigation and presented the evidence and project photos of the crimes committed by profiteers such as Liu and Wan. The members of the Municipal Consultative Committee, members of the Municipal People's Government, and government staff members attending the meeting were very indignant when they heard the crimes of these corrupt elements and profiteers, and expressed their opinions on how to deal with these cases. They unanimously stated that these corrupt elements and profiteers who stole state property should be dealt with in a timely manner according to the seriousness of their cases, whether they confessed or not, and the degree of their confessions. The meeting focused on discussing the case of Liu Yuanjing, Wan Xuanzhi and others collectively stealing state property and endangering the national defense construction cause. Everyone believed that such heinous profiteers should be severely punished according to law.

Fu Huating, member of the Municipal Consultative Committee and Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: We must carry out internal and external attacks, and upper and lower attacks on illegal industrial and commercial households. Now that the government is going to deal with a batch of illegal industrial and commercial households, this is exactly what the industrial and commercial circles are asking for. Profiteers like Liu Yuanjing and Wan Xuanzhi who endanger national defense construction should naturally be severely punished. Le Songsheng, member of the Municipal People's Government, Vice Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, and Manager of Tongrentang Chinese Pharmacy, said: Liu Yuanjing should be sentenced to death because his crimes are related to national defense construction; he actually cut corners in military projects and should be severely punished. Sun Fuling, Secretary-General of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and Manager of Fuxing Flour Mill, said: The Liu Yuanjing case is related to national defense construction, and I agree to handle it severely. Lao She, member of the Municipal People's Government and writer, said: In the case of Liu Yuanjing, the principal offender must be sentenced to death. The people of the whole country know that Liu Yuanjing is the ringleader of this case. He is the Director of the Construction Industry Association and a representative of the Municipal People's Representatives Conference. He knowingly violated the law and cannot be forgiven. Zheng Yun, member of the Municipal People's Government and educator, said: People in general are extremely concerned about national defense construction projects. These profiteers collectively stole more than 100 million yuan in state assets, which ruined the entire project. These heinous criminals must be severely punished; otherwise, public anger cannot be appeased. Chen Yuan, member of the Municipal Consultative Committee and President of Fu Jen Catholic University, said: I think these cases should be dealt with quickly, those who confess should be treated leniently, and those who refuse to confess should be treated severely. Major profiteers like Liu Yuanjing and Cao Bulin should be sentenced to death. Chen Mingde, member of the Municipal Consultative Committee and General Manager of Xinmin Daily, said: This batch of cases vividly demonstrates the ugly face of the bourgeoisie. We must transform the decadent and corrupt thinking of the bourgeoisie. It is best to hold a public trial and deal with them in public. Fei Xiaotong, member of the Municipal Consultative Committee and Professor of Tsinghua University, said: Those who resist the movement, endanger the national defense cause, and knowingly violate the law and refuse to confess and embezzle more than 100 million yuan should be severely punished. Zeng Zhaolun, member of the Municipal Consultative Committee, said: In my opinion, the most lenient sentence for the major thieves in the Liu Yuanjing case should be life imprisonment. Zhu Changjiang, member of the Municipal Consultative Committee and Chairman of the Trade Union of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, said: Major profiteers who endanger national defense construction should be severely punished. When the major profiteer Liu Yuanjing was arrested, the employees of the Electric Power Bureau said that such heinous profiteers must be sentenced to death. Xu Chubo, Yang Yunyu, Liu Yifeng, Ling Qijun, Wang Chun, Dong Ruqin, Yang Zaoxin, and Guo Feiran also spoke at the meeting.

Finally, Vice Chairman Liu Ren and Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu summarized everyone's opinions and explained that after these cases have been fully discussed, they will be submitted to the competent authorities for research in order to make a final decision.
