    Celebrating the Second Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
    Xu Deheng
    Two years have passed since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. As we joyfully celebrate this great and glorious day, we should further recognize the solemn significance of this treaty. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance not only ushered in a new era of great friendship between China and the Soviet Union but also added another layer of guarantee to Asian peace and universal world security. It considers not only the long-term interests of the Chinese and Soviet peoples but also the long-term interests of the people of all Asia and the world. This is a treaty to prevent wars of aggression; a treaty to strive for peaceful construction; a treaty to defend people's democracy. The development of the international and domestic situation over the past two years has fully demonstrated the great significance of this treaty.
    First of all, it must be pointed out that this treaty has played an extremely significant role in preventing wars of aggression. Article 1 of the treaty clearly stipulates: "Both Contracting Parties undertake jointly to endeavor to take all necessary measures with the aim of preventing a repetition of aggression and violation of peace on the part of Japan or any other state that may collaborate with Japan directly or indirectly in acts of aggression. In the event of either of the Contracting Parties being attacked by Japan or states allied with it, and thereby being involved in a state of war, the other Contracting Party shall immediately render military and other assistance with the total strength at its disposal." Precisely because of such provisions, although US imperialism vainly attempted to expand its war of aggression in the Far East, starting with the invasion of Korea, it could not but be wary in the face of the powerful and invincible strength of China and the Soviet Union and did not dare to carry out aggression wantonly. Since the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea on June 25, 1950, the Chinese people organized the Volunteers in late October to fight alongside the Korean People's Army, while at the same time launching a vigorous and dynamic movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea at home, giving the American aggressors a heavy blow. In accordance with the provisions of the treaty, China and the Soviet Union closely cooperated in diplomatic struggles against US aggression and in defense of peace in Asia and the world, and have achieved a series of victories. These victories are significantly related to the strong alliance between China and the Soviet Union. In other words, this is an important achievement of the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union in preventing aggression and defending peace. This achievement has greatly inspired the people of Asia and the world who love peace, guiding them to unfold the movement against American aggression and to maintain peace with more confidence.
    In opposing the revival of Japanese militarism, China and the Soviet Union have also jointly waged a strong struggle over the past two years. The treaty stipulates: "Both Contracting Parties guarantee to participate, in a spirit of mutual agreement, together with the other Allied Powers in the Second World War, in the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan." This is in line with the interests of the Japanese people and the wishes of the Asian people. However, US imperialism has been pursuing a policy of rearming Japan, and on September 4, 1951, convened the illegal San Francisco Conference, and then signed a unilateral "Peace Treaty with Japan" and the so-called "US-Japan Security Bilateral Treaty," attempting to turn Japan into a US colony and military base, in preparation for launching a new war. Recently, under the direction of US imperialism, the reactionary Japanese Yoshida government has once again assured the US government that it will conclude a "peace treaty" with a small group of Kuomintang remnants who have fled to Taiwan and are spurned by the entire Chinese people. This is the most serious and blatant provocative act against the People's Republic of China by the US and Japan in collusion, following the unilateral "peace" with Japan in San Francisco. On January 26, US imperialism, in collusion with the so-called representatives of the Kuomintang remnants, put forward the absurd and shameless slander of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in the UN General Assembly in the so-called "Accusation against the Soviet Union," in order to cover up the US attempt to use the territory of Burma and other Asian countries, directing Kuomintang bandits and rearming Japan to carry out a new war of aggression against China. This series of evil acts by US imperialism has constituted a major threat to China's security and Asian peace, and at the same time, fully demonstrates its extreme hostility towards the increasingly close and consolidated unity and friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. But we have every reason to fully believe that the great unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, who account for one-third of the world's population, is the guarantee of peace in Asia and the world.
    In fact, the joint efforts of China and the Soviet Union in the peace movement over the past two years have made enormous contributions to mankind. In accordance with the provisions of the treaty, China and the Soviet Union "shall participate, in a spirit of faithful cooperation, in all international activities aimed at ensuring world peace and security, and shall fully contribute their strength to the rapid realization of this aim." At the Warsaw World Peace Congress in Poland and the two World Peace Council meetings, representatives of China and the Soviet Union and peace fighters from all over the world worked together in unity, put forward important proposals for the cause of maintaining world peace, and aroused a profound and influential impact worldwide. The signatures of more than 460 million people in China and the Soviet Union in support of the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers is a great encouragement to the peace-loving people of the world. In the struggle against wars of aggression and in defense of world peace, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has demonstrated extremely great significance. Although US imperialism wants to support Japanese militarist elements, and wants to use the small group of Kuomintang remnants who fled to Taiwan to wantonly harass, the victorious Chinese people have absolute confidence to defeat all their provocative acts.
    Secondly, the selfless assistance given to us by the Soviet people in economic and cultural construction has played an extremely significant role in promoting the rapid development of our country's construction undertakings over the past two years. Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the Soviet Union has provided us with various forms of assistance in loans, joint-stock companies, trade, and technology, providing the necessary conditions for China's economic construction and future industrialization. For example, over the past two years, the Soviet Union has provided our country with the most necessary equipment and materials in accordance with loan agreements, enabling our industry to recover and develop rapidly in a short period of time. The Soviet Union has also helped us develop aviation, non-ferrous metals, rare metals, and petroleum industries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for sovereignty in accordance with the agreements of the joint-stock companies. Such fraternal and cooperative joint-stock companies are essentially different from the so-called joint-stock companies between imperialists and colonies and semi-colonies. In terms of trade, the trade agreements signed between China and the Soviet Union are not only equal and mutually beneficial but also extremely beneficial to China and are a powerful tool for the Soviet Union to help China's economic construction. As for the fact that the Soviet Union has unreservedly dispatched many of the most experienced experts and technical talents to China over the past two years, it has not only saved China incalculable wealth by increasing production and practicing economy, but also laid the foundation for the latest technology for China. The Kovalev work method and the advanced metal cutting method have been widely promoted throughout the country, thus significantly improving both output and quality. The enormous value of the Soviet experts' many reasonable suggestions for our economic construction, the training of new technical personnel, and the adoption of various advanced scientific measures and systems in finance and economics is also difficult to estimate. Not only that, but Soviet friends have come to China with a spirit of selfless sacrifice to help us harness the Huai River, build roads, repair ditches, and eliminate plague. They work day and night, not avoiding difficulties and dangers, not sparing fatigue, and even sacrificing their lives. This noble quality of proletarian selflessness and their fraternal assistance to us will never be forgotten.
    In terms of cultural exchange, China and the Soviet Union have also shown a spirit of full cooperation over the past two years and have achieved great success. Over the past two years, the people of the two countries have conducted several visits by cultural groups and individuals to exchange experiences in struggle and various construction experiences. As for the mutual introduction of literature, drama, movies, and music between the two countries, especially the introduction of Marxist-Leninist works and the large-scale translation of Soviet books into Chinese, this has greatly helped cultural cooperation between China and the Soviet Union.
    Finally, we must recognize that the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is built on the basis of proletarian internationalism, so it is the most genuine, unwavering, and like-minded. Both China and the Soviet Union are countries led by the working class, and the goals of the Chinese and Soviet peoples' struggle are to eliminate the capitalist exploitation system worldwide and realize the liberation of all mankind. Therefore, our friendship is a revolutionary friendship, a class friendship of the working class. Imperialist elements and those with bourgeois ideas cannot understand this friendship, so they either fabricate rumors and slanders or doubt and distort it. We must resolutely strike back at these malicious conspiracies that slander the friendship between China and the Soviet Union with rumors, slanders, doubts, and distortions; and we must also severely refute those who look at Sino-Soviet friendship with the selfish and opportunistic eyes of the bourgeoisie. We must deeply appreciate the great truth of Chairman Mao's "leaning to one side," leaning to the side of socialist Soviet Union, leaning to the side of the peace and democracy camp, consolidating the victory of our people's revolution; and, together with the Soviet people and all people who love peace and pursue truth, jointly accomplish the great revolutionary cause of liberating all mankind.
    In short, our celebration of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance today has its extraordinary and great significance, whether from the international or domestic perspective.
    Chairman Mao said on February 15, 1950: "People can see that the unity of the peoples of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, which has already been fixed by treaty, will be permanent, indestructible, and no one can separate it. And this unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice throughout the world." The development of the international situation and our domestic situation over the past two years has fully confirmed that Chairman Mao's instructions are wise and correct. As we commemorate the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance on this great and glorious day, our people throughout the country should strive with a hundredfold confidence and persistent efforts to smash all the aggressive plans of US imperialism, realize peace in Asia and the world, and victoriously build the great motherland of new democracy.

    庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年
    许德珩
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订到现在两周年了。我们欣逢这一伟大光辉的日子，应该进一步的认识这个条约的庄严的意义。由于中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，不但中苏两国伟大的友谊从此进入了新的纪元，同时也使亚洲和平与世界普遍安全多了一层保障。它不但照顾着中苏两国人民的长远利益，也照顾到全亚洲和全世界人民的长远利益。这是一个防止侵略战争的条约；是争取和平建设的条约，是保卫人民民主的条约。两年来国际局势和国内形势的发展，已充分说明了这个条约之伟大的意义。
    首先，必须指出：这个条约在防止侵略战争方面起了极其重大的作用。条约的第一条就明白地规定：“缔约国双方保证共同尽力采取一切必要的措施，以期制止日本或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。一旦缔约国任何一方受到日本或与日本同盟的国家之侵袭，因而处于战争状态时，缔约国另一方即尽其全力给予军事及其他援助。”正因为有了这样的规定，美帝国主义虽然妄想以侵略朝鲜为起点，在远东扩大侵略战争，但在中苏两国强大无敌的力量面前，就不能不有所忌惮，不敢肆意的进行侵略。自从一九五○年六月二十五日美帝国主义发动了侵略朝鲜的战争以后，十月下旬，中国人民组织了志愿军到朝鲜去和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，同时在国内展开了轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，给美国侵略者以沉重的打击。中苏两国根据条约的规定，在反对美国的侵略行为，捍卫亚洲与世界和平上，曾密切合作的进行了外交上的斗争，获得了一连串的胜利。这些胜利，和中苏两国强固的同盟有重要的关系。换句话说，这是中苏两国伟大同盟在防止侵略保卫和平方面的重要成就，这个成就大大地鼓舞了亚洲以及全世界爱好和平的人民，引导他们更有信心地展开了反对美国侵略维护和平的运动。
    在反对日本重新军国主义化方面，两年来中苏两国也共同进行了坚强的斗争。条约规定：“缔约国双方保证经过彼此同意与第二次世界战争时期其他同盟国于尽可能的短期间内共同取得对日和约的缔结”。这是符合日本人民的利益和亚洲人民的愿望的。但美帝国主义一直执行着重新武装日本的政策，并于一九五一年九月四日召开了非法的旧金山会议，随即签订了片面的“对日和约”与所谓“美日安全双边条约”，企图变日本为美国的殖民地和军事基地，以准备发动新的战争。最近日本吉田反动政府又在美帝国主义指使之下向美国政府保证与全中国人民所唾弃的、逃到台湾去的一小撮国民党残余匪帮缔结“和约”。这是美日相互勾结起来，继旧金山对日片面“媾和”之后又一次的对中华人民共和国最严重最露骨的挑衅行为。一月二十六日，美帝国主义又勾结国民党残余匪帮的所谓代表在联合国大会上提出荒诞无耻的诽谤苏联和中华人民共和国的所谓“控苏案”，以掩饰美国企图利用缅甸和其他亚洲国家的领土，指使国民党残匪和重新武装日本来进行对中国新的侵略战争阴谋。美帝国主义这一连串的罪恶行为，已构成对中国的安全与亚洲和平的重大威胁，同时也充分地表现出它对中苏两国人民日益亲密和巩固的团结友谊的极端仇视。但我们有理由完全相信，占全世界三分之一人口的中苏两国人民的伟大团结，就是亚洲与世界和平的保障。
    事实上，中苏两国两年以来在维护和平运动上的共同努力，对人类的贡献是非常巨大的。中苏两国依照条约的规定：“以忠诚的合作精神，参加所有以确保世界和平与安全为目的之国际活动，并为此目的之迅速实现充分贡献其力量。”在波兰的华沙世界和平大会和两次世界和平理事会上，中苏两国代表和世界和平战士团结一致的在一起工作，对维护世界和平事业，提出了重要的方案，在全世界范围内，引起了深入人心的影响。中苏两国人民有四亿六千万以上的签名，拥护五大国缔结和平公约，对于争取和平的世界人民是一个极大的鼓舞。在反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平的斗争中，中苏友好同盟互助条约显出了极其伟大的意义。美帝国主义虽然想把日本军国主义分子扶植起来，虽然想利用流亡到台湾的国民党一小撮残余匪帮来肆行骚扰，但胜利了的中国人民是有绝对的信心来击败它们一切的挑衅行为。
    其次，苏联人民在经济建设和文化建设方面给我们的大公无私的援助，对于我国两年来在建设事业上突飞猛进的发展，起了极其重大的推进作用。自从中苏友好同盟互助条约签订以后，苏联在贷款、合股公司、贸易和技术方面，给予了我们各种各样的援助，对中国的经济建设和将来的工业化，提供了必要的条件。例如：两年来苏联已根据贷款协定，供给我们的国家以最必需的装备和器材，使我们的工业能在短期间内迅速恢复和发展。苏联又根据合股公司的协定，在平股平权及尊重主权的互利基础上，帮助我们发展航空、有色金属、稀有金属和石油工业。这样兄弟般合作的合股公司，是和帝国主义与殖民地及半殖民地之间的所谓合股公司，是有着本质上的差别的。在贸易方面，中苏两国所签订的贸易协定，不仅仅是平等互惠的而且是对中国极为有利的，是苏联帮助中国经济建设的一种有力的工具。至于苏联两年来毫不吝惜地派遣许多最有经验的专家和技术人才到中国来，不但为中国增产节约了无可估计的财富，而且还为中国奠定了最新技术的基础。全国各地已经普遍地推行了郭瓦廖夫工作方法和金属高度切削法，从而使产量和质量都有显著的提高。苏联专家对于我国经济建设方面的许多合理的建议，新技术人员的培养，以及在财经方面采取了苏联各种先进科学措施和制度，其价值之巨大也是难以估计的。不仅如此，苏联朋友们以忘我的牺牲精神到中国来帮助我们治淮、筑路、修沟、除鼠疫，他们日以继夜地工作着，不避艰险，不辞劳瘁，甚至牺牲他们的性命。这种无产阶级大公无私的高贵品质、这种对我们兄弟般的帮助，是令我们永矢不忘的。
    在文化交流方面，中苏两国两年来也表现了充分合作的精神，而且获得了极大的成就。两年来两国人民进行了若干次文化团体和个人的访问，以交换斗争的经验，交换各种建设的经验。至于两国文学、戏剧、电影、音乐等方面的相互介绍，尤其是马列主义著作的介绍和苏联书籍之大量地翻译到中国来，对于中苏两国间的文化合作，是有很大的帮助的。
    最后，我们必须认识，中苏两国人民的伟大友谊，是建筑在无产阶级国际主义的基础上面，因而他是最真实的，坚决不渝的，志同道合的。中苏两国都是在工人阶级领导下的国家，中苏两国人民奋斗的目标，都是要在全世界范围内消灭资本主义的剥削制度，实现全人类的解放。因此，我们的友谊，是革命的友谊，是工人阶级的阶级友谊。帝国主义分子和抱有资产阶级思想的人，对于这种友谊是不可能理解的，因之，他们不是造谣中伤，便是怀疑曲解。我们对于这些以造谣中伤、怀疑曲解来诬蔑中苏两国友谊的恶毒阴谋，必须予以迎头痛击；对于那班以自私自利投机取巧的资产阶级的眼光来看中苏友谊的人，也要予以严厉的驳斥。我们要深切的体会毛主席的“一边倒”的伟大真理，倒向社会主义的苏联一边，倒向和平民主阵营一边，巩固我们人民革命的胜利；并和苏联人民及一切爱好和平追求真理的人们一道、共同完成解放全人类的伟大的革命事业。
    总之，我们今天庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约的缔结，无论从国际方面或国内方面来说，都有其不寻常的伟大意义。
    毛主席于一九五○年二月十五日曾说：“人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”两年来国际局势和我们国内形势的发展，完全证实了毛主席的指示是英明的、正确的。我们今天纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年这个伟大光辉的日子，我们全国人民应以百倍的信心和持久不懈的努力，为粉碎美帝国主义的一切侵略计划，实现亚洲与世界和平，胜利地建设新民主主义的伟大祖国而奋斗。
