The disciplinary actions taken by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party against the degenerated and deteriorated former leadership organs and most members of the Suichuan County Party organization are entirely correct. Our Suichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and all Communist Party members fully support this correct measure and accept and remember this profound lesson to警惕警惕 ourselves.

We have examined our previous mistakes, which has led us to recognize that the reason why the Suichuan County Committee, headed by Jiao Ergong, and most of its members degenerated and deteriorated, committing a series of errors of principle, was mainly because they developed a sense of arrogance, complacency, and self-entitlement in the victorious situation nationwide. They failed to recognize and appreciate Chairman Mao's admonition that "the work done in the past is only the first step in a long march of ten thousand miles" and that "the Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the Chinese revolution is longer, and the work is greater and more arduous." They were muddle-headed and aloof, and under the erosion of bourgeois ideology, they nurtured and developed corrupt and hedonistic thoughts, leading to the prevalence of serious problems of corruption, waste, and depravity throughout the county for a period of time.

Secondly, the democratic life of the Suichuan County Committee's leadership was extremely unsound. There was no strong core of leadership, and there was serious factional strife and disunity. We have examined the fact that Jiao Ergong and others did not keep any records of the county committee meetings during the long period of seventeen months from October 1949 to February 1951. County committee members had opinions of each other but were unwilling to criticize each other face to face. Instead, they separately pulled and tugged at lower-level cadres, each drawing a batch of cadres, spreading an atmosphere of "you rectify me, I rectify you." Therefore, among the cadres, there was a distinction between the Jiao and Sun factions (namely Sun Yuanfa, the former county head). Because of the disunity among the county committee, it directly affected the lack of unity among local cadres and external cadres, among various organizations and groups, and among cadres of various departments; it also affected the lack of unity among cadres at the district level.

Furthermore, there was a serious state of lack of organization and discipline. Some major tasks were decided arbitrarily without seeking instructions. For example, the work of repairing rivers and roads in 1950 was decided solely by Jiao Ergong, without seeking instructions from higher levels or discussing it at the county committee meeting. Because the county committee leadership had such serious erroneous work styles, it influenced and fostered the same phenomenon of lack of organization and discipline in various districts and units. For example, the County Finance and Grain Bureau built office buildings in the name of repairing warehouses, the county government used tax revenues for organizational production, and the former Public Security Bureau Chief Lu Bin did not turn over the confiscated silver dollars to the higher authorities but instead circulated them in the market, seriously violating the policies of the Party and the People's Government.

In order to挽回挽回 the Party's political influence, the Suichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, under the correct leadership of the higher-level Party organization, has dealt with the problems left over from the past. At the People's Representative Conference of all circles convened by the government, we announced the decision of the Provincial Committee to punish Jiao Ergong, Lu Bin, Sun Yuanfa, and Comrade Han Feng. And sincerely accepted the well-meaning and reasonable criticisms of the conference representatives. Cadres who had beaten and scolded the masses in the past made self-criticisms at the conference and apologized to the masses; those who had infringed upon the fruits of the masses' struggle were required to return them to the masses within a limited time; those who had used public funds to buy watches and other items were decided to return the items; those who had embezzled public property and wasted money have also been dealt with according to the specific circumstances. Therefore, the masses generally responded: "The Communist Party is truly great, no matter who does bad things, it will not work."

In order to accept the lessons of the past, the County Committee has decided to do the following in its future practical leadership:

一、 To improve the leadership of the Party Committee, form a core force, and hold regular county committee meetings to study the instructions of the higher levels, discuss and decide on work, put problems on the table, and actively oppose all kinds of liberalism.

二、 To strengthen ideological leadership and summarize work in a timely manner. Before each new task arrives, hold expanded meetings of cadres and people's representative conferences of all circles to check and summarize the work of the previous stage. Fully promote democracy to check the leadership at the county, district, and township levels, correctly resolve the relationship between cadres and the masses, and promptly correct the bad work styles of cadres such as 包办代替 and commandism.

三、 To strengthen organizational life,展开批评和自我批评, and deal with problems in a timely manner. The previous lessons have told us that without a sound organizational life, corrupt and vulgar liberalistic work styles will occur.

四、 To strengthen theoretical study. In the past, the Suichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party did not attach importance to learning, which was also one of the reasons why the bad ideas of the bourgeoisie invaded our Party and caused these serious errors. Therefore, only by continuously strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought can we eliminate bourgeois ideas, criticize petty-bourgeois ideas, and establish proletarian ideas.

### 接受遂川事件的沉痛教训

    接受遂川事件的沉痛教训
    中共遂川县委会
    中共江西省委对蜕化变质的前遂川县党组织领导机关及大部成员的纪律处分是完全正确的。我们中共遂川县委及全体共产党员完全拥护这一正确的措施。并接受和牢记这一沉痛的教训来警惕自己。
    我们检查了以前的错误，使我们认识到以焦尔恭为首的遂川县委及大部成员所以蜕化变质，犯了一连串的原则性的错误，主要因为在全国胜利形势下，产生了骄傲自满、功臣自居的思想。他们没有认识和体会到毛主席告诫我们的：“过去的工作只不过像万里长征走完了第一步”和“中国革命是伟大的，但中国革命以后的路程是更长的，工作更伟大更坚苦”。他们昏昏然高高在上，在资产阶级思想侵蚀下，滋长和发展了腐化享乐思想，致使贪污浪费、腐化堕落的恶劣现象，在一段时间内成为全县的严重问题。
    其次，遂川县委领导方面的民主生活极不健全，一直没有坚强的领导核心，严重地存在着宗派斗争和不团结现象。我们检查焦尔恭等自一九四九年十月到一九五一年二月这十七个月的长时间中，没有一份县委会议的记录。县委委员之间互有意见，却不肯当面批评，而是分别在下级干部中拉拉扯扯，各拉一批干部，散布“你整我，我整你”的空气。因此，干部中则有焦、孙（即孙元法，前任县长）等派别的区分。由于县委之间闹不团结，直接影响到本地干部和外来干部、各机关团体、各部门干部也互不团结；同样也影响了区一级干部不团结。
    再次就是严重的无组织无纪律状态。有些重大工作不经请示即擅作主张。如一九五○年的修河和修公路工作，都是焦尔恭个人决定的，既没有请示上级，也没有在县委会议上讨论。由于县委领导方面有这样严重错误作风，从而也就影响和助长了各区及各单位产生了同样无组织无纪律的现象。如县财粮局借修仓库名义建筑办公厅，县府动用税款作机关生产，前公安局长鲁斌对没收的银洋不往上缴，还拿到市上流通，严重地违犯了党和人民政府的政策。
    为了挽回党的政治影响，中共遂川县委组织在上级党的正确领导下，处理了过去遗留下来的问题。我们在政府所召开的各界人民代表会议上，宣布了省委对焦尔恭、鲁斌两人及孙元法、韩峰两同志的处分决定。并诚恳地接受了大会代表善意的合理的批评。过去打骂过群众的干部，在大会上做了检讨，并向群众赔礼、道歉；凡侵犯群众斗争果实的限期向群众交还；凡动用公款买表及其他物品的，则决定将实物交还；凡贪污公家的东西及浪费的钱，亦已根据具体情况作了处理。因此，群众普遍反应：“共产党真伟大，不论什么人作坏事也不成。”
    县委为了接受过去的教训，决定在今后实际领导工作中做到如下几点：
    一、健全党委领导，形成核心力量，定期召开县委会议来研究上级指示，讨论和决定工作，有问题摆在桌上，积极地反对各式各样的自由主义。
    二、加强思想领导，及时总结工作。每项新的工作来到以前，都召开干部扩大会议和各界人民代表会议来检查和总结上一阶段的工作。充分发扬民主来检查县区乡各级领导，正确解决干部和群众的关系，及时纠正干部中的包办代替、强迫命令等恶劣作风。
    三、加强组织生活，展开批评和自我批评，遇到问题及时处理。以前的教训已告诉我们，没有健全的组织生活，腐朽庸俗的自由主义作风就会发生。
    四、要加强理论学习。过去中共遂川县委员会没有重视学习，也是使资产阶级恶劣思想侵袭到我们党里来，而产生了这些严重错误的原因之一。因此不断加强马列主义和毛泽东思想的学习，才能肃清资产阶级思想，批判小资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想。
