    Great Friendship
    Collaboration by Feng Zhen, Wun, Miao Di, Zeng Shanqing, Hao Hongzhang
    (1) On August 14th of last year, the section of the China Chang Railway from Tieling to Changtu suffered the worst flood in decades. At 1:30 p.m. that day, Soviet expert Durasov, director of the Shenyang Branch of the China Chang Railway, and his entourage went to Qinghe Bridge in the pouring rain to assess the flood situation and the condition of the roadbed at the bridgehead.
    (2) At this time, the water level of the Qinghe River was rising very rapidly, with the water surface only a little over a meter from the bottom of the bridge. Villages on both sides of the river were submerged. Durasov was watching the rapid currents of the Qinghe River when he suddenly saw rooftops, trees, pigs, cattle, and other items being washed downstream, and also saw women holding children crying for help.
    (3) Durasov was deeply saddened to see so many farmers and children about to be swept away by the flood. Disregarding the danger of the bridgehead being submerged, he and the soldiers and workers guarding the bridge threw ropes, blankets, wooden boards, and anything else that could save people into the water to rescue the victims. Many soldiers and workers who could swim bravely jumped into the water to save people.

    伟大的友谊
    冯真、乌恩、苗地  曾善庆、郝宏章合作
    （一）去年八月十四日，中长路铁岭到昌图间遭到数十年来没有过的大水灾。当天下午一点半钟，中长路沈阳分局局长苏联专家杜拉索夫和一行人在倾盆大雨中到清河桥头了解涨水情况和桥头路基状态。
    （二）这时，清河的水势上涨得非常猛烈，水面距桥的底部只差一公尺多，两岸的村庄都被淹没了。杜拉索夫正在注视着清河的急流，忽然发现房盖、树木、猪、牛等被洪水冲流下来，并看到有的妇女抱着小孩子呼救。
    （三）杜拉索夫眼看到许多农民和小孩要被洪水冲走，非常难过。他不顾桥头被水淹没的危险，和守桥的战士、工人把绳子、被单、木板等一切能救人的东西都抛到水里去抢救灾民，许多会游泳的战士和工人也都奋不顾身地跳下水去救人。
