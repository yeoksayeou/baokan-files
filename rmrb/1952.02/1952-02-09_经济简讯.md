Economic Briefs

    Dong Liudong, the leader of the roving maintenance group of the First Spinning Department of the No. 1 Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill, thought: "If we want to increase production, we must speed up the machine. If we change the pulley from 13 inches to 12.5 inches, the front roller speed of the spinning frame for 21-count weft yarn can reach 240 revolutions, but this has never been done before." Thinking of this, he was a little worried: would the tinplate drum make noise? What if the roller gets hot and the frame shakes? So he went to the veteran workers to discuss it, and the veteran workers supported him. The trade union also supported him. After the first machine was modified, the machine ran normally and the yarn breakage rate met the standard. The next day, the output increased to 1.2 pounds, creating the first new record in the factory. The news that the First Spinning Department had created a new record quickly spread to various workshops. The spinning workers of the Second Spinning Department immediately learned from their experience and increased the front roller of the spinning frame for 18-count warp yarn from 225 revolutions to 275 revolutions, resulting in an increase in output to 1.446 pounds. In this way, the national record for the daily output of 18-count yarn was created.
    The workers of the freight department of the Tieling Station of the Shenyang Branch of the China Changchun Railway Administration and the workers of the baling group of the State-owned Cotton Company of Tieling County, Liaoxi Province, worked closely together. They loaded 239 bales of hand-baled (first using a wooden baling machine to compress the cotton, then using hemp rope to tie it) cotton onto an open freight car with a carrying capacity of 30 tons, with a load of 23.9 tons, exceeding the standard cotton loading volume (13 tons) stipulated by the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government by nearly one time, creating the national record for the amount of hand-baled cotton loaded per freight car.
    The daily output of the rotary kiln in the calcination workshop of the Northeast State-owned No. 3 Cement Plant reached 571 tons on January 7, becoming the highest record in the country. After the calcination workshop completed the annual production increase and economy campaign ahead of schedule last year, it carried out major mechanical repairs and solved many technical problems. After the kiln was opened, the kiln operators learned from the advanced Soviet experience of burning more and rotating faster in operation methods, so that the combustion temperature remained normal.
    Over the past year, the staff and workers of the State-owned Yangquan Iron Plant have worked hard to improve the operating methods of a certain small blast furnace, and have continuously created 17 new production records from the start of the furnace in February last year to December 14. This series of new records enabled the Yangquan Iron Plant to complete its annual production task ahead of schedule. The output of each furnace of this small blast furnace has been increased to 53.623 tons, more than double the original design capacity (25 tons).
    Steelworkers in the steelmaking plant of a certain steel company in Central and South China created a new national record of 91 heats of steelmaking in a Bessemer converter in 24 hours. The 24-hour output increased by 192.8 percent compared with before the production increase and economy campaign. Therefore, the steelworkers in the Bessemer converter can increase the country's profits by 11.12 billion yuan a year.
    Liu Chunlin and Li Huazhang, cotton ginning workers at the Nanyuan Office of the Beijing Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company, with the attitude of masters and a high degree of patriotism, actively studied and patiently overcame all difficulties, and gradually improved the cotton ginning machine, so that the cotton ginning output increased from 8,000 jin (8 hours) per day to 12,500 jin, creating the latest record for the same machine in the country. As far as the machine itself is concerned, the key to increasing production lies in speeding up the rotation of the saw blade shaft. Therefore, they changed the original 6.5-inch motor wheel to 7.5 inches (the original speed was 600 revolutions per minute, and the speed after the change was 720 revolutions per minute). The slope of the cotton tray was also appropriately enlarged; the horizontal bar between the large ribs and the small ribs was changed from three minutes to four minutes; and the brush wheel was changed from 6.2 inches to 7 inches to accelerate the rotation rate, so that the cotton lint cut off by the saw blade shaft could be brushed down and discharged in time. After the machine was modified, the output was greatly increased. If we calculate one year as 365 days, excluding holidays, festivals, machine repairs or days when work cannot be done due to strong winds and storms, the net working days are counted as 250 days, and the annual production volume of each machine can reach 3,125,000 jin of seed cotton, an increase of 1,125,000 jin compared to last year.

    国营上海第一棉纺织厂第一纺部细纱保全小组长董留东想：“若要增加生产，就必须加快机器运转速度，如果把皮带盘由十三吋改到十二吋半，纺二十一支纬纱的细纱车的前罗拉速度就可以转到二百四十转了，但是这是过去从来没有过的事。”想到这里，他心里就有点顾虑：白铁滚筒会不会发响呢？罗拉发热，车架动摇怎么办呢？于是他就去找老工人们商量，老工人们支持他。工会也支持他。第一部车子改装后，车子运转正常，断头率也合乎标准，第二天产量就提高到一点二磅，创造了全厂第一个新纪录。第一纺部创造新纪录的消息，飞快地传到各车间。第二纺部的细纱工人马上学习他们的经验，把纺十八支经纱的细纱车的前罗拉由二百二十五转提高到二百七十五转，结果产量提高到一点四四六磅。这样，就创造了十八支纱日产量的全国最高纪录。
    中长铁路管理局沈阳分局铁岭车站货物处工人和辽西省铁岭县国营棉花公司打包组工人密切结合，以一辆载重量三十吨的敞车车皮，装人力捆（先用木制打包机用人力把皮棉压缩后，再用麻绳捆）的皮棉二百三十九包，载重二十三点九吨，超过中央人民政府铁道部规定的标准装棉量（十三吨）将近一倍，创造了每辆车皮装人力捆的皮棉的全国最高纪录。
    东北国营第三水泥厂烧成车间的回转窑日产量在一月七日达到五百七十一吨，成为全国的最高纪录。烧成车间在去年提前完成了全年增产节约任务以后，就进行机械大检修工作，解决了许多技术问题。开窑以后，看火工人在操作方法上学习了苏联的多烧快转的先进经验，使燃烧温度保持正常。
    一年来国营阳泉铁厂职工努力改进某号小型炼铁炉的操作方法，自去年二月份开炉至十二月十四日已连续创造了十七次产量新纪录。这一连串的新纪录使阳泉铁厂提前完成了全年生产任务。这一小型炼铁炉每炉的产量已提高到五三点六二三吨，超过了原设计能力（二十五吨）一倍以上。
    中南某钢铁公司炼钢厂炼钢工人创造了贝氏炉二十四小时炼钢九十一炉的全国新纪录。二十四小时的产量较增产节约运动前增加了百分之一百九十二点八强。因此，贝氏炉的炼钢工人一年可为国家增加利润一百一十一亿二千多万元。
    北京市花纱布公司南苑办事处轧花工人刘春林、李华章，以主人翁的态度、高度爱国主义的精神，积极钻研，耐心克服一切困难，逐渐改进轧花机，使轧花产量由每日（八小时）八千斤提高到一万二千五百斤，创全国同样机器的最新纪录。就机器本身来说，增产的关键在于使锯齿轴旋转的速度加快。因此，他们就把原来的六点五吋的马达轮改为七点五吋（原来每分钟转六百周，改后转七百二十周）。并将托花笓子坡度适当弯大；大肋骨和小肋骨间的横档由三分改为四分；再将刷子轮由六点二吋改为七吋，使旋转率加速，这样锯齿轴所削掉的棉绒就能及时刷下，吐出口外。机器经过改造后，大大提高了产量。如一年以三百六十五天算，除去例假、节日、修理机器或大风暴雨等不能工作的日数，净工作日以二百五十天计，每台机器全年生产量可达籽棉三百一十二万五千斤，较去年增产
    一百一十二万五千斤。
