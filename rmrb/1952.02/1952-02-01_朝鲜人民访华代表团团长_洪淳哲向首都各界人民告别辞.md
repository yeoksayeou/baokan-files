Dear citizens of Beijing, respected comrades and comrades-in-arms:

　　On behalf of the Korean People's Delegation to China, I extend warm, comradely greetings to you residing in Beijing, the capital of the fraternal nation—the People's Republic of China—and the place where the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, lives.

　　During our half-month stay in Beijing, we have received warm welcomes and excellent hospitality. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the various departments of the Central People's Government and the Chinese People's Committee for Resisting America and Aiding Korea, especially to the brothers and sisters, the comrades-in-arms, of Beijing. The comrades in our delegation will never forget this great fighting friendship.

　　Dear citizens of Beijing!

　　One of the fundamental factors behind the great and brilliant victories achieved by the people of Korea and China in the fight against our common enemy—the American imperialist aggressors—is unity and coordination. In order to achieve even greater victories in the great struggle ahead, this visit of the Korean People's Delegation to China will further strengthen the friendship and unity between our two peoples by visiting our fraternal nation—China.

　　At the report meetings and symposiums held in Beijing, we have introduced the heroic fighting spirit of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in their courageous struggle against the American aggressors, as well as the bestial atrocities committed by American imperialism and its lackeys against the Korean people. At these report meetings, people from the military, workers, cadres of government organizations, students, women, industrialists and businessmen, religious circles, and other sectors of Beijing warmly welcomed us. While we were reporting, you enthusiastically shouted slogans like "The peoples of Korea and China unite more closely! Resolutely defeat the American aggressors!" and expressed your intention to further expand the ongoing nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy and the campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. This concern was shown to us once again by the more than 120,000 people who participated in over eighty meetings.

　　Dear brothers and sisters, comrades-in-arms, of Beijing! In the course of the war against American aggressors, the friendship and unity between the people of Korea and China has become even stronger. This great strength will deter any imperialist aggressor forces from acting rashly.

　　We feel that our arrival in your country, coinciding with the nationwide campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, is of great significance to us. Although our time in Beijing has been short, we have clearly seen the people of Beijing responding enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's call, and the flames of the struggle to resist America and aid Korea, to increase production and practice economy, and to oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy have erupted like a volcano. We have learned a lot from this.

　　The delegation will report in detail to our compatriots back home the specific situation of the Chinese people's campaign to resist America and aid Korea and to increase production and practice economy, so that the unity between the people of Korea and China will be further consolidated, the fighting will of the soldiers at the front will be further enhanced, and our people will learn from your valuable experience in supporting the front and increasing production and practicing economy. Moreover, the delegation will actively participate in the work on the battlefront against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

　　Dear citizens of Beijing, comrades-in-arms, comrades!

　　The Korean People's Delegation to China is about to leave Beijing temporarily to continue our visit in other places. We have received a warm welcome in Beijing, and this friendly enthusiasm has inspired every comrade in the delegation. We will certainly bring the strength you have given us to our work.

　　I believe that when we return to Beijing, we will see even greater brilliant achievements in your movement to resist America and aid Korea, increase production and practice economy, and oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.

　　Finally, I wish all the brothers and sisters, comrades-in-arms, and comrades of Beijing good health and success in battle. Before temporarily leaving Beijing, I, on behalf of the Korean People's Delegation to China, bid you all farewell for now.

    朝鲜人民访华代表团团长
    洪淳哲向首都各界人民告别辞亲爱的北京市民们，敬爱的同志们、战友们：
    　我代表朝鲜人民访华代表团，向战友的国家——中华人民共和国的首都、中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席住的地方——北京居住着的你们致以热烈的战友的敬礼。
　　在北京的半个月，我们受到了热烈的欢迎和很好的招待，我代表代表团向中央人民政府各机关和中国人民抗美援朝总会，尤其是北京市的兄弟姊妹们、战友们致以衷心的感谢，我们代表团同志将永远不会忘记这种伟大的战斗的友情。
    亲爱的北京市民们！
    朝、中两国人民在反对共同敌人——美国帝国主义侵略者的战斗中所以能取得如此伟大的辉煌的胜利，团结协同是其中的基本因素之一。为了在今后伟大斗争中取得更大胜利，这次我们朝鲜人民访华代表团，将通过访问战友的国家——中国，更进一步地加强我们两国人民的友谊与团结。
    我们已把与美国侵略者英勇斗争的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军无敌的战斗雄姿，以及美帝国主义及其走狗对朝鲜人民的野兽暴行等，在北京的报告会、座谈会上做了介绍。在这些报告会上，北京市的部队、工人、机关干部、学生、妇女、工商业者、宗教界人士及其他各阶层人民热烈地欢迎了我们。当我们报告的时候，你们热烈地喊着“朝中两国人民更亲密地团结起来。坚决打败美国侵略者！”的口号；并向我们表示将把目前全国正在开展着的增产节约运动和反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动，更加广泛地开展起来，这是参加八十余次会议的十二万余人民又一次对我们关心的表现。
    亲爱的北京市兄弟姊妹们、战友们！在反对美国侵略者的战争过程中，朝中两国人民的友谊与团结更进一步地坚强起来了。这一伟大的力量，使任何帝国主义侵略势力也不敢轻举妄动。
    我们觉得这次来到贵国，正赶上全国热烈地开展着反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动，这对我们来说，意义是非常巨大的。我们在北京的日子虽然很短，但是我们清楚地看到了北京市人民热烈响应毛主席的号召，展开抗美援朝运动、增产节约运动、反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的斗争火焰，火山一样地爆发了。我们从这里学到了很多东西。
    代表团将把中国人民正在展开着的抗美援朝运动和增产节约运动的具体情况，详细地转告给我们祖国的同胞，使朝中两国人民的团结更加巩固，使前方的将士们的战斗意志更加高涨，使我国人民学习你们支援前线、增产节约的宝贵经验。不仅如此，代表团将在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争战线上，积极参加工作。
    亲爱的北京市民们、战友们、同志们！
    朝鲜人民访华代表团就要暂时离开北京了，到各地方去，继续我们的访问工作，我们在北京受到了你们热烈的欢迎，这种友谊的热情，鼓舞了代表团的每一个同志，我们一定把你们给予我们的力量带到工作中去。
    我相信，当我们重返北京时，我们将会看到你们抗美援朝、增产节约运动、反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的更大的光辉成就。
    最后，敬祝北京市兄弟姊妹们、战友们、同志们的身体健康与战斗胜利。在暂时离开北京之前，我代表朝鲜人民访华代表团暂时向各位告别。
