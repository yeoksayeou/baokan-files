To the Editor:

During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the China Salt Industry Company discovered a case of unscrupulous merchants colluding with corrupt elements to form a "defense alliance." When Shi Fengxi, a cadre of the company, handled the printing of "Salt Industry Teaching Materials" at Wuxue Printing Factory, he accepted a bribe of 3 million yuan from the factory. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, despite patient education, Shi Fengxi refused to confess. Instead, he sought out Xin Mianzhi, the briber from the printing factory, to form a "defense alliance." Both parties decided that neither would speak, attempting to resist the movement. Later, after the Salt Industry Company sent personnel to Wuxue Printing Factory for investigation several times, the printing factory realized that it could no longer conceal the truth and submitted a confession to the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce. However, the corrupt element Shi Fengxi remained unrepentant and refused to confess. Finally, the company held a struggle meeting, and under the pressure of the masses and with conclusive evidence, Shi Fengxi had no choice but to admit the fact of his embezzlement. Furthermore, Zhao Nianren, a trade union cadre and Youth League member of the China Salt Industry Company, received a kickback of 90,000 yuan when purchasing cultural and recreational items at Yongxing Store in Xidan. Although he had confessed this matter at the beginning of the movement, the person in charge of Yongxing Store refused to confess and stubbornly issued a written statement declaring "there was no kickback or bribery, otherwise, he would bear the responsibility of being reported," attempting to deceive and get away with it. After repeated questioning and education, Yongxing Store finally confessed the truth.

The above facts show that all "defense alliances" and concealment tactics will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat in the face of the masses.

    中国盐业公司贪污分子史凤玺  
    和奸商订“攻守同盟”被揭穿
    编辑同志：中国盐业公司在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，曾发现奸商勾结贪污分子，订立“攻守同盟”的事。这个公司的干部史凤玺经手在武学印刷厂印制“盐业教材”时，曾接受武学印刷厂贿赂三百万元。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，虽经耐心教育，但史凤玺却不坦白，反而去找印刷厂的行贿分子辛勉之订立“攻守同盟”。双方决定谁也不许讲，企图抵抗这一运动。后来经过盐业公司数次派员前往武学印刷厂调查，印刷厂方面知道已无法隐瞒，才写了一个坦白材料送给北京市工商业联合会。但贪污分子史凤玺仍执迷不悟，拒不坦白。最后，公司召开了斗争大会，在群众的压力下，又加以证据确凿，史凤玺才不得不承认这一贪污事实。又，中国盐业公司工会干部、青年团员赵念仁，在西单永兴商行购买文化娱乐用品时，吃了回扣九万元。运动开始时，他虽已交代了这件事，但永兴商行的负责人却拒不坦白，反顽固地立了“并无回扣行贿等情，否则愿负被检举之责”的字据，企图矇骗过关。经一再追问和教育，永兴商行才把真实情况坦白出来。
    上面的事实说明：一切“攻守同盟”、隐瞒等花样，在群众面前，必将遭受可耻的失败。
