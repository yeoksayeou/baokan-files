Wounded and Injured Volunteer Soldiers Zhang Fenglin and Wang Guotai
Write to This Newspaper to Accuse the Heinous Merchant Zhang Shuchun of His Crimes

To the Editor:

We are wounded soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers, recuperating in a rear hospital.

Just as our great motherland was beginning its construction, American imperialism launched a war of aggression in our neighbor, Korea, threatening the security of our motherland. Therefore, we abandoned everything and went to the forefront to defend our motherland and resist the American aggressors. In the Fifth Campaign, we were unfortunately wounded. We returned to our motherland to recuperate. From the first day of our return, especially during our convalescence here, we have received the love and meticulous care of the people of the whole country. Although we were wounded, some even crippled, we were not discouraged at all, because we have the care of our motherland and our people.

However, the illegal merchant Zhang Shuchun took a different position and framed us. The rear hospital where we are recuperating was contracted to Zhang Tongxing Construction Factory to repair the houses before we arrived, with the understanding that they should be "windproof and rainproof." But the奸商 Zhang Shuchun, in order to obtain exorbitant profits, bribed the cadre Kong Mingsheng and cut corners in the project. As a result, we were rained on as soon as we moved in. Because the rain soaked the walls, our ward collapsed at 3:00 a.m. on August 30th of last year. There were seven comrades living in our ward at the time. Our dear comrade-in-arms Li Rongkao was crushed to death on the spot, Zhang Fenglin's arm was broken, three other comrades were seriously injured, and two comrades were slightly injured. We demanded that responsibility be investigated at the time, but the奸商 bribed the cadres, and the responsibility was shirked.

In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, all of our wounded and sick comrades demanded that the government bring the奸商 Zhang Shuchun to clarify the matter. Zhang Shuchun not only refused to admit his guilt, but also shirked responsibility, saying, "I am not responsible, I didn't build this house." We have already grasped the evidence of his bribery and corruption of cadres and cutting corners, but he cunningly deceived us, saying, "I did not bribe the cadres. It is illegal to bribe cadres. I didn't do it, you can't wrong me. If it is found out, I am willing to be punished by the law." We feel that the奸商 Zhang Shuchun's cunning denial and refusal to confess is too hateful and intolerable.

Editor, our dear comrade-in-arms was killed by the奸商. He didn't sacrifice his life fighting the American aggressors on the Korean battlefield, but he was killed by illegal merchants! The essence of the bourgeoisie is to harm others for their own benefit and to seek only profit. In order to obtain exorbitant profits, they do not hesitate to harm the lives of our Volunteer Army comrades! We accuse the奸商 Zhang Shuchun of his crimes to the people of the whole country, and we demand that the People's Government immediately arrest and bring the奸商 Zhang Shuchun to justice and make him pay back the blood debt he owes us. Our Volunteer Army, with the support of the people of the whole country, has defeated American imperialism. We believe that the people of the whole country, united as one, will certainly be able to suppress the bourgeoisie's rampant attack!

    被砸伤的志愿军伤病员张凤林王国泰
    写信给本报控诉大奸商张树春的罪行
    编辑同志：
    我们是中国人民志愿军因负伤而在某后方医院休养的伤员。
    正当伟大祖国开始建设的时候，美帝国主义在我们邻邦朝鲜发动了侵略战争，威胁着我们祖国的安全。因此，我们放弃了一切，走上了保卫祖国的最前线，抗击美国侵略者。在第五次战役中，我们不幸负了伤。我们回到祖国休养。从回国第一天开始，特别是我们在这里疗养时期，受到全国人民的热爱和无微不至的关怀。我们虽然负了伤，有的甚至残废了，但我们丝毫没有气馁，因为我们有祖国、有人民照顾。
    可是，不法商人张树春却站在不同的立场上来陷害我们。我们休养的后方医院，在我们没来以前，由张同兴营造厂承包修理房屋，讲的是“不透风，不漏雨”。但奸商张树春为了取得暴利，却收买了干部孔明生，在工程中大量地偷工减料。因此，我们一搬进去就遭到雨淋。由于雨水浸湿了墙壁，我们的病房在去年八月三十日早晨三时就塌了下来。当时我们病房里住的有七个同志。我们亲爱的战友李荣考同志当时就被砸死了，张凤林的臂膀折断了，另三个同志重伤，两个同志轻伤。我们当时要求追究责任，可是奸商贿赂了干部，责任又被推卸掉了。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我们全体伤病员同志要求政府把奸商张树春找来，要他把问题交代清楚。张树春不但不低头认罪，反而推卸责任说：“我不能负责，这房子不是我修的。”我们已经掌握了他贿赂腐蚀干部、偷工减料的材料，但他却狡猾地欺骗我们说：“我没有贿赂干部。贿赂干部是犯法的。我没做，不能冤枉人。如果查出来我愿受国法制裁。”我们觉得奸商张树春这样狡猾抵赖、拒不坦白的行为，太可恶了，太不能容忍了。
    编辑同志，我们亲爱的战友被奸商杀害了。他在朝鲜战场上，和美国侵略者搏斗时也没牺牲，但竟被不法商人杀害了。资产阶级的本质就是损人利己、唯利是图的。为了取得暴利，他们不惜陷害我们志愿军同志的性命！我们向全国人民控诉奸商张树春的罪恶，我们要求人民政府立即把奸商张树春逮捕法办，让他偿还欠下我们的血债。我们志愿军在全国人民支持下把美帝国主义都打败了，我们相信全国人民团结一致，也一定能把资产阶级的猖狂进攻压下去！
