Xinhua News Agency Report: More than two thousand representatives of industrial workers in Shanghai held a representative meeting on February 20th for the "Anti-Bribery, Anti-Tax Evasion, Anti-Theft of State Assets, Anti-Shoddy Work and Cutting Corners, and Anti-Stealing of State Economic Intelligence" campaign. This was a mobilization meeting for Shanghai's million-strong working class army to launch a fierce counterattack against the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive, in order to consolidate the leadership of the working class. The conference unanimously passed a telegram to Chairman Mao and four resolutions. The four resolutions are: 1. We, the one million workers of Shanghai, are determined, with high enthusiasm and firm resolve, to resolutely counterattack the bourgeoisie's rampant offensive in order to protect the interests of the Chinese people and the working class. 2. We must strengthen publicity and education among the workers and the masses throughout the city, so that everyone understands the essence of the bourgeoisie and its various ugly faces, draws clear class lines, and raises class consciousness. 3. We, the one million workers of Shanghai, must resolutely, under the leadership of the Communist Party, strengthen the unity of workers, staff, and technicians, expose the bourgeoisie's various criminal and shameless acts, mobilize mass reporting, and use our brains to create various methods to strive for a complete victory in the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy work and cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence. 4. We, the one million workers of Shanghai, vow to bravely advance, and will never give up until we win a complete victory in the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy work and cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence!

At the meeting, Chen Yi, Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and Liu Changsheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, delivered speeches. They called on the city's workers to follow the shop assistants, organize their ranks, and continue to repel the bourgeoisie's offensive. Then, Han Xiya, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees' Union, spoke. He announced to the conference that as of the 19th of this month, the city's 200,000 shop assistants had submitted more than 246,000 letters reporting unscrupulous merchants, and that not only young shop assistants actively participated in the battle, but also senior staff and older shop assistants had joined the struggle. Huang Jiasi (who participated in the volunteer medical surgery team to Korea), Vice Chairman of the Medical Workers' Union, denounced at the meeting the towering crimes of unscrupulous merchants such as Wang Kangnian, who used fake medicines to impersonate genuine medicines and used rotten meat to make canned food to harm the volunteers.
