    The Korean Workers' Party and the Korean People's Army
    —Written in Commemoration of the Fourth Anniversary of the Founding of the Korean People's Army
    Li Chengye, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party
    The Korean people, in the environment of the just Fatherland Liberation War for the independence, freedom, and honor of their fatherland, are welcoming the fourth anniversary of the founding of their own true armed force – the Korean People's Army.
    Although the Korean People's Army is a young army with only four years of history, from the very first day of its creation, it embarked on a victorious and glorious road of serving the fatherland and the people. Thanks to the military might of the great Soviet Union, the Korean people were liberated from the long-term colonial rule of Japanese imperialism. The Korean people saw the path for their own fatherland to develop into a unified, democratic, and independent nation. However, the US imperialist aggressors, who had advanced into the southern half of our country, undermined the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference agreement on resolving the Korean issue, which was a crucial key to handling post-war world issues, and illegally submitted the Korean issue to the United Nations General Assembly. The Soviet army, in order to hand over the cause of Korean autonomy and independence to the Korean people themselves, completely withdrew from the northern half of the region in 1948. However, the United States not only kept its troops stationed in South Korea, but also openly implemented a colonial policy of dividing our country. The sinister intention of the US imperialists in pursuing this aggressive policy in the southern half of our country was not only to turn the southern half of Korea into its colony and military base, but also to obliterate all the achievements of democratic reforms and democratic construction that had been implemented in the northern half, turning the entire Korean peninsula into its military base and bridgehead for launching a new war of aggression against the Soviet Union and China.
    Under these circumstances, the Korean people realized that in order to defend the independence of their country and the achievements of the democratic reforms already achieved by the Korean people in the northern half, it was necessary to create their own truly people's armed forces. Thus, on February 8, 1948, our beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-sung and the Korean Workers' Party under his leadership created the Korean People's Army. At that time, Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out: "In order to make our country a completely independent and sovereign nation, it is necessary to have a people's army that defends our country and people and does not allow any enemies to invade our country and people." The Korean People's Army, created in this way, is a new type of army that is essentially different from the armies of any capitalist country.
    The characteristic of the Korean People's Army is that it directly inherits the patriotic tradition of the long-term anti-Japanese armed struggle of Comrade Kim Il-sung, the leader beloved by the Korean people. It is a true people's armed force composed of outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean workers, peasants, and other working people. Therefore, the Korean People's Army is by no means merely a tool for a small handful of capitalists and landlords to suppress and exploit the people, as is the case with the armies of capitalist countries, but is a true defender of the interests of the people. It does not despise the people of other countries, nor does it invade other nations. It is a peace fighter who seeks friendship between the peoples of all countries and opposes warmongers. It is willing to sacrifice its life to stop the enemy from encroaching upon its country and people, and to fight to defend the fatherland. It is a strong fortress to defend the fatherland. From the first day of its birth, the Korean People's Army began to grow and strengthen in the years of receiving the Marxist-Leninist ideological education of our Party and learning the advanced Soviet military science and outstanding combat technology.
    Today, in the long and fierce Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggressors of American and British imperialism and their accomplices, the Korean People's Army has been tempered into a powerful force that is bound to win, not only militarily but also politically. This is by no means accidental. As Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out: "If our Party had failed to create the Korean People's Army in time and properly nurture it, we would have been completely wiped out by the American imperialists and the Lee Seung-man gang." The correctness of our Party's timely creation of the Korean People's Army and its education and training has been clearly proven in the war of aggression launched by the American imperialists.
    The Lee Seung-man traitorous gang, according to the plan of the American imperialist aggressors and under the direct instigation of the American aggressors, launched a sudden armed invasion of the northern half of the Republic. In order to defend the fatherland, our Party's Political Committee decided to resist the enemy and launch a counter-offensive, organized a military committee, mobilized all manpower and material resources in the country, and reorganized all work into a wartime system, concentrating all sovereign power in the country in order to guide the war towards the final victory. In order to ensure the victory of the war, our Party mobilized its entire organizational structure and strength to make all work serve the just war.
    After the American imperialist plunder army openly launched an armed invasion against our country and people, the nature of the war changed, its scope expanded, and it entered a protracted phase. Our Party then quickly carried out the work of forming more divisions, arming the entire people, training a large number of military cadres, and preparing our reserve forces. In view of the expansion of the army, our Party sent tens of thousands of outstanding Party members to the army and the front line in order to strengthen the People's Army. At the same time, in order to strengthen army discipline, improve combat effectiveness, enhance the vanguard role of the Party and Party members, and further strengthen the political work of educating the entire army with a high degree of patriotism and revolutionary spirit, our Party established Party organizations within the Korean People's Army units. Precisely because of this, under the command of the Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Il-sung, the heroic People's Army demonstrated a high degree of patriotic dedication and heroic tenacity, and liberated the capital of the Republic, Seoul, three days after launching a counter-offensive against the invading enemy. Within a few months, it liberated vast areas of the southern half of the Republic. During this period, almost all of the main force of the Lee Seung-man puppet army was annihilated. The main force of the American imperialist invading army - the 24th Division, the 25th Division, and the 1st Cavalry Division - suffered fatal blows. Many of our combined forces, led by the 4th Guards Seoul Kim Chaek Division, were awarded the glorious title of "Guards Unit". The 12th Infantry Division, the 82nd Regiment, and the 1st Engineer Regiment all received the Order of Freedom and Independence.
    However, the American imperialist aggressors, who suffered such a fatal blow in the face of the offensive of our heroic People's Army, disregarding the huge casualties of their mercenaries, and in order to realize their wild attempt to invade our country, threw a huge force into the Korean battlefield and began a new invasion. Our People's Army, facing an enemy that was numerically superior, had to carry out a temporary strategic retreat. During this critical period of retreat, thanks to the correct leadership of our Party and the unyielding efforts of our Party members, our People's Army preserved its main force, made an effective and organized retreat, and prepared to counterattack the enemy in a short period of time. In addition, a part of the People's Army persisted in the most arduous containment war behind enemy lines, launched guerrilla warfare in many areas, dispersed the enemy's military forces, and disrupted and cut off the enemy's transportation lines. In particular, the great Chinese people, at this time, held high the just banner of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending Our Country," and sent the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their outstanding sons and daughters, to the Korean battlefield, which greatly strengthened our forces in resisting the common enemy of the Korean and Chinese people - the American imperialist armed aggressors, and strengthened the Korean People's Army's confidence in victory. Comrade Kim Il-sung pointed out: "The great act of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party in sending their volunteer forces to aid the Korean people will write an immortal page in the history of the Korean people's liberation struggle." The Korean People's Army and the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers fought closely side by side, and by the end of 1950, they had everywhere encircled and annihilated a large number of enemies who had invaded the northern half of the country, and driven the remaining enemies south of the 38th parallel. In 1951, the war formed a stalemate, and our army inflicted serious blows on the enemy's manpower in that year.
    In the course of the battle, our heroic People's Army, regardless of the smoke and bullets, in the fierce battle environment where every inch of land was contested, often established many combat achievements because our Party members played a vanguard role and demonstrated unparalleled tenacity, heroism, and patriotic dedication. They maintained the honor of Korean Workers' Party members with their selfless and heroic struggles. In the nineteen months of the war, most of the more than 300 People's Army officers and soldiers who were awarded the title of Hero of the Republic were Korean Workers' Party members. In this way, the Korean People's Army, which our Party created and properly nurtured in a timely manner, through the arduous Fatherland Liberation War, in various combat processes such as counter-offensive, retreat, and stalemate, further improved and tempered its military technology and combat capabilities, and grew into a modern armed force that is invincible in all battles. On the contrary, the so-called "technical superiority" and all the wishful thinking and bluster of "quick victory" that the American imperialist aggressors have vigorously promoted are now difficult for even themselves to believe. Their internal contradictions are deepening and their morale is declining.
    So, what are the reasons why the young People's Army, with only four years of military history, can achieve such brilliant results in the face of the fierce and unparalleled world imperialist arch-criminal - the American imperialist armed aggressors and their accomplices, and can lay the foundation for the final victory of the just Fatherland Liberation War?
    First, it lies in the fact that our leader Comrade Kim Il-sung and our Party under his leadership created the People's Army in a timely manner and gave it correct education and training with the immortal truth - Marxist-Leninist thought; it lies in the fact that our Party makes the entire people do their best to strengthen their armed forces, organize and promote the people to love, respect and support the People's Army. Today, the Korean people support our Party's fighting slogans: "Everything for the front line!" "Everything for victory!" Supporting the People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, everything serves the victory of the war. An army supported and loved by the entire people is invincible.
    Second, our People's Army, in the heroic struggle for the freedom and independence of its own country, is not only supported by the Korean people, but also supported and sympathized with by the great Soviet people, the Chinese people, and the peace-loving people of the world. In particular, the assistance of the fraternal Chinese People's Volunteers organized and sent by the great Chinese people has greatly strengthened the Korean People's Army's fighting power and confidence in victory. The internationalist unity between the Korean and Chinese peoples and the revolutionary friendship formed by long historical traditions are fully capable of crushing and defeating the mad invasion of any imperialist aggressor.
    The American imperialist armed aggressors' wild attempt to conquer our people and then invade the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is bound to suffer a thorough and shameful defeat in the face of the strong joint struggle of the Korean and Chinese peoples. The Korean people's just cause of striving for the independence, freedom, and honor of their fatherland will eventually be realized. (Xinhua News Agency)

    朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜人民军
    ——为纪念朝鲜人民军建军四周年而作
    朝鲜劳动党中央委员会书记  李承烨
    朝鲜人民在争取祖国独立、自由与荣誉的正义的祖国解放战争环境中，迎接真正属于自己的武装力量——朝鲜人民军建军四周年。
    朝鲜人民军虽然是只有四年历史的年青的军队，但是它从创建的头一天起，就走上了为祖国和人民服务的胜利而光荣的道路。由于伟大苏联的武力，朝鲜人民从日本帝国主义的长期的殖民地统治中获得了解放。朝鲜人民的面前，出现了自己的祖国能够发展成为统一的民主独立国家的道路。但是，进驻我国南半部的美帝国主义侵略者破坏了处理战后世界问题的重要关键之一——莫斯科三外长会议关于解决朝鲜问题的协定，非法地把朝鲜问题提交联合国大会。苏联军队为把朝鲜的自主、独立的事业交给朝鲜人民自己，在一九四八年完全撤出北半部地区。但是，美国不但把自己的军队留驻在南朝鲜，而且公开地实行了分裂我国的殖民地政策。美帝国主义者在我国南半部实行这种侵略政策的凶恶意图，不仅是要变朝鲜南半部为其殖民地与军事基地，而且是要抹煞在北半部业已实施的一切民主改革和民主建设的成果，使全朝鲜变成它发动侵略苏联和中国的新战争的军事基地和桥头堡。
    在这种情况下，朝鲜人民认识到：为了保卫自己祖国的独立，保卫朝鲜人民在北半部业已取得的民主改革的各项成果，就必须创建自己真正的人民武装力量。于是，在一九四八年二月八日，我们敬爱的领袖金日成同志和他领导的朝鲜劳动党创建了朝鲜人民军。当时，金日成同志曾指出：“为使我们祖国成为完全自主独立的国家，就必须拥有保卫我祖国和人民、不容许任何仇敌侵略我祖国和人民的人民军队。”这样创建起来的朝鲜人民军，是和任何资本主义国家的军队有着本质上的不同的新型军队。
    朝鲜人民军的特点在于它直接继承了朝鲜人民所敬爱的领袖金日成同志的长期抗日武装斗争的爱国主义传统。它是由朝鲜的工人、农民等劳动人民的优秀儿女所组成的真正的人民武装力量。因此，朝鲜人民军绝对不是像资本主义国家的军队那样只是为一小撮资本家、地主的利益来压制和榨取人民的工具，而是人民利益的真正拥护者。它不蔑视他国人民，也不侵略其他民族。它是谋求各国人民之间的友谊并反对战争贩子的和平战士。它不惜献出生命，为制止敌人侵犯自己的祖国和人民、为保卫祖国而斗争。它是保卫祖国的强大的堡垒。朝鲜人民军从诞生的头一天起，就开始在接受我党的马克思列宁主义思想教育、并学习苏联先进的军事科学和卓越的战斗技术的岁月中成长壮大起来了。
    今天，朝鲜人民军在反抗美英帝国主义武装侵略者及其帮凶的长期激烈的祖国解放战争中，不但在军事上，而且在政治上，已锻炼成必胜不败的强大力量了。这绝不是偶然的事情。正如金日成同志所指出的：“如果我党未能及时创建朝鲜人民军并予以正确培养的话，我们早已被美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮完全消灭了。”我党及时创建朝鲜人民军并予以教育和训练的正确性，在美帝国主义者所发动的侵朝战争中得到了清楚的证明。
    李承晚卖国匪帮按照美帝国主义侵略者的计划，并在美国侵略者的直接指使下，对共和国北半部进行了突然的武装侵犯。我党政治委员会为了保卫祖国，就决定反抗敌人，并举行反攻，组织军事委员会，动员国内一切人力、物力，使一切工作改编为战时体制，集中掌握国内的一切主权，以便引导战争走向最后胜利的道路。我党为了保障战争的胜利，动员了自己整个的组织机构和力量，使全部工作为正义战争服务。
    美帝国主义掠夺军队为反对我国和人民而公开地进行武装侵犯后，战争的性质发生了变化，范围也扩大了，并且转入了长期化。我党乃迅速地进行了编制更多的师团、武装全体人民、培养大批军事干部、准备我们的后备军等工作。我党鉴于军队的扩大，为了加强人民军，把数以万计的优秀党员派遣到军队和前线。同时，为了加强军队的纪律，提高战斗能力，提高党和党员的先锋作用，进一步加强以高度的爱国主义思想和革命精神来教育全体军队的政治工作。我党在朝鲜人民军部队内建立了党的组织。正因为如此，英勇的人民军在最高司令官金日成同志的指挥下，发挥了高度的爱国主义献身性和英雄主义顽强性，在向进犯的敌人举行反攻后的三天，就解放了共和国首都汉城。几个月内，就解放了共和国南半部的广大地区。在此期间，李承晚伪军的主力几乎全部溃灭。美帝国主义侵略军的主力——第二十四师、第二十五师、骑一师遭到了致命的打击。我们的以近卫汉城金策第四师为首的许多联合部队，获得了“近卫部队”的光荣称号。第十二步兵师、八十二联队、第一工兵联队都获得了自由独立勋章。
    但是，在我们英勇的人民军的进攻面前遭到这种致命打击的美帝国主义侵略者，不顾其雇佣兵的巨大伤亡，为了实现其侵略我国的狂妄企图，又把庞大的兵力投入朝鲜战场，开始了新的进犯。我们人民军面对着数量上占优势的敌人，不得不实行暂时的战略退却。在这严重的退却时期，由于我党的正确领导和我们党员不屈不挠的努力，我们人民军保存了自己的主力，作了有效的有组织的后退，并在短期内进行了反击敌人的准备。此外，人民军一部在敌后坚持了最艰苦的牵制战，在许多地区展开了游击斗争，分散了敌人的军事力量，破坏和切断了敌人的运输线。特别是伟大的中国人民，在这一时期高举“抗美援朝保家卫国”的正义旗帜，派遣自己的优秀儿女所组成的中国人民志愿军到朝鲜战场来，这就大大地加强了我们反抗朝中两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义武装侵略者的力量，坚定了朝鲜人民军的胜利信心。金日成同志曾指出：“中国人民和中国共产党派遣自己的志愿部队来援助朝鲜人民这一伟大的举动，将在朝鲜人民的解放斗争史上写下永垂不朽的一页。”朝鲜人民军和兄弟般的中国人民志愿军紧密地并肩作战，至一九五零年底到处大量地围歼侵入北半部的敌人，并将残敌驱逐到三八线以南去了。在一九五一年中，战争形成了相持状态，而我军在这一年中给了敌人的有生力量以严重的打击。
    在战斗过程中，我们英勇的人民军不顾硝烟弹雨，在寸土必争的激烈的战斗环境里，经常是由于我们党员起先锋作用而发挥了无比的顽强性和英雄主义、爱国主义的献身性，建立了许多战斗功勋。他们以自己献身的英勇的斗争，保持了朝鲜劳动党员的荣誉。在十九个月来的战争中，荣膺共和国英雄称号的三百多位人民军官兵大部分是朝鲜劳动党员。这样，我党及时创建并加以正确培养的朝鲜人民军，通过艰苦的祖国解放战争，在反攻、退却、相持等各种各样的战斗过程中，更加提高和锻炼了自己的军事技术和战斗能力，壮大成为百战百胜的现代化的武装力量了。相反的，美帝国主义侵略者大肆鼓吹的所谓“技术优势”和叫嚣“速战速决”的一切妄想和虚张声势，现在连他们自己也难以相信了。他们内部的矛盾日益加深，士气日益低落。
    那么，仅有四年建军历史的年青的人民军，面对着凶恶无比的世界帝国主义的元凶——美帝国主义武装侵犯者及其帮凶，能够取得这种光辉成果，并能奠定正义的祖国解放战争最后胜利的基础的原因在那里呢？
    第一，在于我们的领袖金日成同志和他所领导的我党及时创建了人民军，并以万古不朽的真理——马克思、列宁主义思想予以正确的教育和培养；在于我党使全体人民竭力加强自己的武装力量，组织和推动人民爱护、尊敬和支援人民军。今天，朝鲜人民拥护我党战斗的口号：“一切为了前线！”“一切为了胜利！”支援着人民军和中国人民志愿军，一切为战争的胜利服务。受着全体人民的支持和爱护的军队是无敌的。
    第二，我们人民军在争取自己祖国的自由独立的英勇斗争中，不仅受着朝鲜人民的支援，而且受着伟大的苏联人民、中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的支援与同情。特别是伟大的中国人民所组织和派来的兄弟般的中国人民志愿军的援助，大大地加强了朝鲜人民军的战斗力量和胜利信心。朝中两国人民之间的国际主义团结和以长期的历史传统所结成的革命友谊，完全能够粉碎和战胜任何帝国主义侵略者的疯狂进犯。
    美帝国主义武装侵略者想征服我国人民并进而侵略伟大的苏联和中华人民共和国的新战争狂妄企图，在朝中两国人民的强有力的共同斗争面前，一定要遭到彻底的可耻失败。朝鲜人民争取自己祖国独立、自由、荣誉的正义事业，终将实现。  （新华社）
