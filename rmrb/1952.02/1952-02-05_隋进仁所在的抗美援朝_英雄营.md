Sui Jinren is the deputy political instructor of a certain battalion of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and a representative of this delegation of returned volunteers. In the fifteen months since arriving in Korea, Sui Jinren's battalion participated in a total of four campaigns, eliminating 3,198 enemies, capturing 79 enemies, and seizing 12 howitzers, 35 recoilless guns, 16 mortars and other artillery pieces, 9 anti-aircraft machine guns, 35 heavy machine guns, 20 light machine guns, 124 rifles and short guns, 151 vehicles, and many other military supplies. Ten members of the entire battalion were awarded military medals by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, one person was awarded the Korean Second Class Order of Merit, four platoons were commended by higher authorities as hero platoons, two hero companies, and two hero companies. Higher authorities awarded the honorary title of "Hero Battalion." The following is one of their battles.

In the defensive battle on the south bank of the Han River, they completed twenty-three days and nights of continuous defensive tasks. All commanders and fighters demonstrated "valiant fighting and tenacious defense." During the defense of Hill 580, countless heroic deeds emerged. For example, Lin Tianfa, a model Youth League member of the machine gun company, was wounded twice but refused to leave the front line while defending Hill 409. Under the enemy's intense artillery fire, he used two heavy machine guns alone, moving back and forth between the two ends of the position to strike the enemy. When the machine gun legs were destroyed by artillery fire, he rested the machine gun on his left leg to fire, and only discovered at night that his left leg was scalded. The 9th Company killed and wounded more than 770 enemies in the battle to defend Tiande Peak and other heights; the 8th Company, while defending Hill 409.1, with only seven people, repelled twenty attacks by the enemy in company and platoon strength, eliminating more than 150 enemies. Wu Lengcang, a soldier of the 3rd Squad, had his eyes injured and bleeding profusely by enemy artillery fire, but he still insisted on staying at the front line. He said to the squad leader: "I am a fighter of the Chinese and Korean people and a soldier of the hero company, I must hold the position. I can't see, but I can hear, and I can still throw grenades." He finally shed the last drop of blood for the happiness of the Chinese and Korean people. (Picture attached)

    隋进仁所在的抗美援朝“英雄营”
    隋进仁是志愿军某营的副教导员，是这次志愿军归国代表团的代表。到朝鲜十五个月以来，隋进仁所在的营一共参加了四次战役，歼灭敌人三千一百九十八名，俘虏敌人七十九名，缴获榴弹炮十二门，无座力炮三十五门，迫击炮和其他炮十六门，高射机枪九挺，重机枪三十五挺，轻机枪二十挺，长短枪一百二十四支，汽车一百五十一辆，和其他许多军用物资。全营有十人荣获朝鲜民主主义人民共和国颁发的军功章，一人荣获朝鲜二级荣誉勋章，有四个班被上级嘉奖为英雄班，二个英雄排，二个英雄连。上级授予“英雄营”的光荣称号。下面是他们的一次战斗。
    在汉江南岸的守备战中，他们完成了二十三昼夜的连续守备任务。全体指战员表现了“打的英勇，守的顽强”。在守备五八○高地时，出现了无数的英雄事迹。如机枪连模范青年团员林天发在守备四○九高地时，二次负伤不下火线，在敌人的猛烈炮火下，他一个人使用两挺重机枪，往返于阵地两端，打击敌人。当机枪腿被炮火打坏后，他把机枪架在自己的左腿上打，直到晚上，他才发觉左腿被烫烂了。第九连在坚守天德峰等高地战斗中，共杀伤敌人七百七十余人；第八连在坚守四○九·一高地时，仅七个人就打垮了敌人成连成排的二十次进攻，歼灭敌人一百五十多名。三班战士吴冷仓两眼被敌人炮火打伤流血不止，但仍坚持不下火线，他对班长说：“我是中朝人民和英雄连队的战士，我一定要守住阵地。我看不见还可以听见，还能打手榴弹。”他终于为中朝人民的幸福流尽了最后一滴血。（附图片）
