    Suggestion to Theaters to Stage Plays Reflecting Current Struggles

    To the Editor: I am a worker's family member from Mentougou, and I have a suggestion for the Yiyuan Theater in Mentougou.

    In this great movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the workers are enthusiastically and intensely besieging the "big tigers." Even we housewives are actively participating in this movement. However, Yiyuan, the only theater in Mentougou, has not staged any programs that reflect this great movement. Instead, it only puts on some old plays like "Little New Year," which are meaningless or of little significance. This is clearly lagging behind reality and does not meet the needs of the masses. Therefore, I suggest that Yiyuan and all theaters should combine with current struggles and stage plays that the masses most urgently want to see.

    建议戏院演一些结合当前斗争的戏剧
    编辑同志：我是门头沟的一个工人家属，我对门头沟意园戏院，有一个建议。
    在这伟大的反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动中，工人都热烈地紧张地围剿“大老虎”，就是我们家庭妇女，也都积极地参加了这个运动。但是在门头沟仅有的一个戏院——意园，却没有演出结合这个伟大运动的节目，只演了一些“小过年”等毫无意义的或意义不大的旧戏，这显然是落后于现实的，不合乎群众要求的。因此，我建议意园以及一切戏院，都应结合现实斗争，演当前群众最迫切要求看的戏。
