To the Editors:

	Starting in 1952, the Yangquan Coal Mining Bureau in Shanxi Province, at a certain price, acquired the Yangquan private coal mine Jinxianghou (because if Jinxianghou continued to operate, it would affect the production of the Yangquan Coal Mine), converting it into a state-owned enterprise. As soon as Jinxianghou's manager, Jing Lanhou, heard this news, he secretly concealed a 15-horsepower electric motor, a diesel engine, and more than a dozen iron pipes from the pit. He also disassembled parts from the electric pump and motor, and replaced the new wooden wheel at the wellhead with an old one. This caused the state to lose more than 200 million yuan in property.

	Jing Lanhou is an old hand at speculation and opportunism. For the past four years, he has consistently courted tax bureau cadres, resulting in large amounts of tax evasion. He once bribed tax bureau cadre Shang Jiyuan more than 3 million yuan and also covered all the expenses of Shang Jiyuan's family; and thus he gained convenient conditions for evading taxes. He also set traps to lure accounting personnel Gao Jinxing and Yang Rumei. When Gao Jinxing's mother died, he sent a gift of 1 million yuan; when Gao had a child, he immediately sent bracelets, silver locks and other items. During festivals, he constantly sent wine and meat to Gao and Yang.

	Jing Lanhou's tricks are vicious, and he has corrupted many cadres. I suggest that the government immediately deal with this profiteer.

    阳泉私营晋祥厚煤矿奸商荆兰厚
    隐匿财产逃避纳税应受国法制裁
    编辑同志：山西阳泉煤矿矿务局自一九五二年起，以一定的代价，收买了阳泉私营煤矿晋祥厚（因晋祥厚再开下去，就要影响阳泉煤矿的生产），改为国营企业。晋祥厚经理荆兰厚一知道了这个消息，就把坑下的一部十五匹马力电动机、一部柴油机、十几根铁管偷偷地隐匿了。他还把电泵和电机上的零件拆走，把井口的新木轮换成旧的。这样使国家损失了二亿多元的财产。
    荆兰厚是个投机取巧的老手。他四年来一贯拉拢税务局干部，偷税漏税的数字很大。他曾向税局干部商继远行贿三百多万元，还负担商继远家中的一切开销；而他也就取得了逃避税收的方便条件。他还布置圈套引诱会计人员高金星、杨如美。高金星的母亲死了，他就送了一百万元的礼；高生了小孩，他马上送手镯、银锁等物。每逢过节，他不断送酒送肉给高、杨两人。
    荆兰厚的诡计是毒辣的，他腐蚀了好多干部，我建议政府立即处理这个奸商。    郁竹
