    Decision of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council on Agricultural Production in 1952
    (Adopted at the 124th Government Administration Council Meeting on February 15, 1952)
    (I)
    In 1951, agricultural production achieved remarkable results under the correct leadership of governments at all levels and the active efforts of all farmers. The total grain output has recovered to 92.8% of the highest pre-war annual output; the total cotton output has exceeded the highest pre-war annual output by 33%; other livestock, aquatic products, flue-cured tobacco, coarse hemp, tea, and oil crops have all completed and exceeded the planned targets. Due to the recovery and development of agricultural production, the lives of the vast number of farmers have been considerably improved, and the national financial and economic situation has been improved. The farmers' current urgent demand is for further expansion of reproduction. The general requirement for agricultural production in 1952 is to reach and exceed the pre-War of Resistance production level. The specific requirements for different regions are as follows: most of the old areas and new areas that have completed land reform with better production conditions are required to exceed the pre-war level; new areas that have generally completed land reform and some old areas are required to reach the pre-war level; disaster areas and new areas that have not yet completed land reform are required to approach the pre-war level. It is required that the national grain output increase by 8% on the basis of 1951; cotton output increase by 20%; and other livestock, aquatic products, and special products such as tea, silk, and fruits should strive to complete and exceed the planned output and strive to improve quality.
    (II)
    In order to improve the lives of farmers and to obtain abundant resources for the country, it is necessary to increase the production of grain, industrial raw material crops, and export crops. The basic principle of agricultural production in 1952 is: to concentrate efforts on increasing the yield per unit area. Grain production must be increased substantially, and its sown area must not be reduced. The sown area of industrial raw material crops and export crops should be stabilized at the 1951 level and not increased. Therefore, all production increase tasks must be resolved by increasing the yield per unit area.
    In order to ensure increased yield per unit area, it is necessary to widely develop water conservancy and overcome various natural disasters. The Government Administration Council issued the "Decision on Vigorously Launching a Mass Drought Prevention and Resistance Movement" on February 8 this year, and governments at all levels should conscientiously implement it. Areas prone to flooding should vigorously build and repair dikes and embankments, dredge ditches, and make preparations for flood prevention and drainage. In order to combat pests and diseases, it is necessary to organize the masses to prevent and control them in a timely manner under the principle of "prevention is more important than treatment," and in particular, to fully prepare medicines and machinery for eliminating pests and diseases.
    Increasing the application of fertilizer is the most effective and feasible way to increase yield per unit area at present. According to local conditions, the masses should be mobilized to fully utilize existing experience, accumulate and produce large quantities of fertilizer, and improve fertilizer application techniques. The most effective way to accumulate fertilizer at present is to raise pigs. Governments at all levels should formulate practical plans to increase the number of pigs, lead farmers to quickly achieve "every household raises pigs, repairs pens, and accumulates fertilizer."
    Systematically summarizing and promoting the experience of high-yield models has a great effect on increasing yield per unit area. Agricultural technology departments and state-owned farms should do a good job in combining scientific and technological knowledge with farmers' experience, provide timely guidance to farmers, break the farmers' complacency of "production has reached the top" and the conservative thinking in agricultural technology, universally establish rural technical research groups, promote improved varieties, and improve farming techniques in all aspects.
    Mobilize the masses to formulate livestock-raising plans and livestock-loving pacts, guide the masses to improve feeding methods, in order to greatly increase the number of various livestock and gradually improve their quality. Develop breeding stations, implement preventive injections, and organize Chinese veterinarians to improve medical technology. If animal epidemics occur, strict disinfection, isolation, blockade, and disposal of animal carcasses must be implemented. In pastoral areas, it is necessary to protect grasslands. Vigorously develop freshwater fish farming and steadily improve marine fishing. Organize fishermen's mutual aid teams and production cooperatives, improve fishing techniques, in order to increase the unit catch. State-owned aquatic enterprises should better play their leading role in fishery production and the market, and closely integrate with coastal defense to strengthen coastal fishery protection work.
    (III)
    Throughout the country, simple, seasonal labor mutual aid teams should be universally and massively developed; in areas with a foundation for mutual aid movements, year-round, fixed-type, agricultural and sideline integrated mutual aid teams should be promoted; in areas with rich mass mutual aid experience and strong backbone, agricultural production cooperatives with land shares should be developed with leadership and focus. Other specialized mutual aid teams and production cooperatives should also be appropriately encouraged. In the old liberated areas, 80% to 90% of the rural labor force should be organized in the next two years, and the new areas should strive to complete this task in about three years. To this end, in addition to conscientiously implementing the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, (1) it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of mutual aid teams, train and cultivate the backbone in the cooperative mutual aid movement, and strengthen the collective education of farmers; (2) mutual aid teams and production cooperatives should formulate production increase plans and sign pre-purchase contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives to combine the country's economic plan with the farmers' economic organizations; (3) guide mutual aid teams to invest surplus labor in intensive cultivation, land improvement, water conservancy construction, afforestation, and the development of sideline occupations and handicrafts to expand production; (4) major regions and provinces should establish farm tool manufacturing plants to manufacture improved new-style farm tools in large quantities and give priority to supplying mutual aid teams and production cooperatives in order to further promote the consolidation and development of mutual aid teams.
    Counties should, to the extent possible, establish and manage one or two state-owned farms. Large-scale mechanized state-owned farms are not yet possible to develop universally at present. Therefore, the state-owned farms run by various counties should use improved new-style farm tools as much as possible, adopt advanced farming techniques, introduce and propagate improved varieties, strengthen business management, implement economic accounting, and ensure that the production volume exceeds that of local farmers, so as to conduct collectivized demonstration education for farmers with the superiority of state-owned farms.
    (IV)
    The decisive key to completing the production increase task in 1952 lies in strengthening the leadership of agricultural production. People's governments at all levels below the provincial level must regard leading agricultural production as the primary task for the whole year.
    The spring plowing season has arrived, and governments at all levels must conduct in-depth inspections and guidance to ensure that the farming season is not missed and that sowing is done in a timely manner. This is the most important issue at present. In order to concentrate efforts on doing a good job in spring plowing, the deployment of current work and the allocation of cadres should be strictly implemented in accordance with the provisions of Section 4 of the Government Administration Council's "Decision on Vigorously Launching a Mass Drought Prevention and Resistance Movement". Areas that are currently undergoing land reform should strive to conclude victoriously before spring plowing, and even if they cannot be concluded as scheduled, efforts should be made to bring them to a conclusion, so as not to delay spring plowing due to land reform.
    The three major movements of land reform, resistance to US aggression and aid to Korea, and suppression of counter-revolutionaries have liberated the productive forces of farmers, stimulated the patriotic enthusiasm of farmers to increase production, and laid a stable production environment. The great struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, which is currently underway, is even more greatly promoting the development of the production increase and thrift movement. All of this has become an unprecedentedly favorable condition for completing the production increase task in 1952. Governments at all levels must strengthen the leadership of agricultural production, launch a universal and upsurging patriotic production increase movement, and strive to complete and exceed the agricultural production plan for 1952.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于一九五二年农业生产的决定
    （一九五二年二月十五日政务院第一百二十四次政务会议通过）
    （一）
    一九五一年的农业生产，在各级人民政府正确领导和全体农民的积极努力下，获得了显著的成绩。粮食总产量已恢复到战前最高年产量的百分之九十二点八；棉花总产量则超过战前最高年产量百分之三十三；其他家畜、水产、烤烟、粗麻、茶叶、油料等均完成并超过了预定的计划。由于农业生产的恢复与发展，已经相当地改善了广大农民的生活，并促进了国家财政经济状况的好转。农民目前迫切的要求是进一步的扩大再生产。一九五二年农业生产总的要求是达到并超过抗战以前的生产水平，对不同地区的具体要求如下：大部老区及完成土地改革生产条件较好的新区，要求超过战前水平；一般完成土地改革的新区及部分老区，要求达到战前水平；灾区及尚未完成土地改革的新区，要求接近战前水平。要求全国在一九五一年的基础上，增产粮食百分之八；增产棉花百分之二○；其他家畜、水产及茶、丝、果品等特产，均须争取完成而且超过计划产量，并努力提高质量。
    （二）
    为了改善农民的生活，为了使国家获得丰富的资源，必须增产粮食、工业原料作物和外销作物。一九五二年农业生产的基本方针是：集中力量提高单位面积产量。粮食必须大量增产，决不能减少其播种面积。工业原料作物和外销作物播种面积稳定在一九五一年的水平上，不予增加。因之，各项增产任务必须从提高单位面积产量上获得解决。
    为着保证提高单位面积产量，必须广泛发展水利，并战胜各种自然灾害。本院已于本年二月八日发布“关于大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动的决定”，各级人民政府均应确实遵照执行。易受水灾地区要大力培修堤防，疏浚沟洫，做好防洪排水的准备工作。为战胜病虫灾害，必须在“防重于治”的方针下，及时地组织群众防治，特别要充分地准备消灭病虫的药械。
    增施肥料是当前提高单位面积产量可能而且最有效的办法。应根据各地具体条件发动群众充分地运用已有经验，大量积肥、造肥，改进施肥技术。在目前积肥最有效的办法就是养猪，各级政府应制定增殖猪的切实计划，领导农民迅速地做到“家家养猪，修圈积肥”。
    有计划地总结和推广丰产模范的经验，对提高单位面积产量有极大的作用。农业技术部门和国营农场应做好科学技术和农民经验相结合的工作，及时地给农民以指导，打破农民“生产到顶”的自满情绪和农业技术上的保守思想，普遍地建立起农村的技术研究组，推广优良品种，并从各方面改进耕作技术。
    发动群众订立增畜计划和爱畜公约，指导群众改进饲养方法，以便大量增殖各种牲畜，并逐步提高其品质。发展配种站，实行预防注射，组织中兽医提高医疗技术。如发生兽疫，必须严格实行消毒、隔离、封锁，处理畜尸。在牧区必须保护草原。大力发展淡水养鱼，稳步提高海洋捕鱼。组织渔民的互助组和生产合作社，改进渔业技术，以提高单位捕鱼量。各国营水产企业应在渔业生产上及市场上更好地发挥其领导作用，并与海防密切结合，加强沿海护渔工作。
    （三）
    在全国范围内，应普遍大量发展简单的、季节性的劳动互助组；在互助运动有基础的地区，应推广常年定型的、农副业结合的互助组；在群众互助经验丰富而又有较强骨干的地区，应当有领导、有重点地发展土地入股的农业生产合作社。其他专业性质的互助组和生产合作社，亦应适当加以提倡。老解放区要在今、明两年把农村百分之八、九十的劳动力组织起来，新区要争取三年左右完成这一任务。为此，除确实贯彻自愿互利的政策外，（1）必须加强对互助组的领导，训练与培养合作互助运动中的骨干，加强农民的集体教育；（2）互助组和生产合作社要订立增产计划，并与供销合作社订立预购合同，使国家的经济计划与农民的经济组织结合起来；（3）引导互助组将剩余劳动力投入精耕细作、土地改良、兴修水利、植树造林、和发展副业、手工业上面以扩大生产；（4）各大区、省在可能条件下均应建立农具制造厂，大量制造改良的新式农具，并优先供给互助组和生产合作社，以便进一步推动互助组的巩固和发展。
    各县在可能范围内尽量地办起和办好一两个国营农场。大规模的机械化国营农场在目前还不可能普遍发展，因之各县所办的国营农场要尽量使用改良的新式农具，采用先进的耕作技术，引种并繁殖优良品种，加强经营管理，实行经济核算，保证超过当地农民的生产量，以国营农场的优越性，对农民进行集体化的示范教育。
    （四）
    完成一九五二年增产任务的决定关键在于加强农业生产的领导。省以下各级人民政府必须把领导农业生产作为贯彻全年的首要任务。
    现在春耕季节已到，各级人民政府必须进行深入的检查与指导，保证不违农时，及时播种。这是当前最重要的问题。为集中力量搞好春耕，对当前各项工作的部署和干部力量的配备，应遵照本院“关于大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动的决定”第四段之规定确实执行。现正进行土地改革的地区应尽可能争取在春耕以前胜利结束，即使不能如期结束者，亦应力求告一段落，不因土地改革而贻误春耕。
    土地改革、抗美援朝和镇压反革命三大运动，解放了农民的生产力，激发了农民爱国增产的热情，并奠定了安定的生产环境。目前正在开展着的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的伟大斗争，更大大地推动着增产节约运动的开展。这一切都成为完成一九五二年增产任务的空前有利条件，各级人民政府必须加强对农业生产的领导，开展普遍高涨的爱国增产运动，为完成和超过
    一九五二年的农业生产计划而奋斗。
