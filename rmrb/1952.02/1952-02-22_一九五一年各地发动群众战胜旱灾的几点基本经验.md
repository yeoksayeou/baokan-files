    Drought conditions in various regions in 1951

    In March and April of 1951, areas north of the Yangtze River, with the exception of the Shandong Peninsula, generally experienced little rainfall. Rainfall in these areas was only half of the average rainfall for previous years. South of the Yangtze River, rainfall in April was excessive, about two to three times the average for previous years. In May, except for the Huai River basin, the entire country generally lacked rain; North China received a few thorough rains in late May, but they were not widespread. In June, vast areas north of the Yangtze River, except for northern Hebei and Pingyuan Province, continued to lack rain. The provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the Northwest provinces had almost no rain for the entire month, and the drought was severe. The provinces of Jiangxi, Yunnan, Hunan, and Guangxi also had little rainfall, and parts of Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Liaoxi had no thorough rains. In July and August, the drought continued in northern Hebei and Chahar, Suiyuan, and Inner Mongolia. The drought was also quite severe in Jiangxi, Hunan, southern Anhui, and northern Anhui.

    Rainfall was uneven in the spring and summer seasons. The north experienced drought in the spring, and the south experienced flooding. In summer, both the north and south experienced drought. Drought-affected areas included most of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Jiangxi, and northern Sichuan provinces, the Xingxian and Xinxian special districts in Shanxi, the Chuxian and Suxian special districts in northern Anhui, the Chizhou special district in southern Anhui, the Suide and Yulin special districts in Shaanxi, counties in southwestern Hunan, the Xiaogan and Yichang special districts in Hubei, the Leshan, Neijiang, and Yibin special districts in southern Sichuan, the Wanxian special district in eastern Sichuan, and a few counties in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Liaoxi, Fujian, northern Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, and Guizhou provinces. The total area of drought-affected farmland was over 125 million mu. The drought was particularly severe in Inner Mongolia, Chahar, Suiyuan, Hebei, Jiangxi, and northern Sichuan.

    From late June to mid-July in Chahar Province, during the crucial crop-growing season, the drought was severe, affecting about two-fifths of the province's cultivated land. The province's total grain production was reduced by about 50% due to the drought. In Suiyuan Province, except for the Yellow River irrigated area in the west, the central and eastern parts of the province experienced severe drought. In Suizhong, Wuchuan, Guyang, and Qingshuihe counties, wheat production was reduced by 50%, and oat production was reduced by 60%. The production of beans and potatoes was even lower. In eastern Suiyuan, wheat and barley production was reduced by two-thirds. In Hebei Province, more than 39 million mu of land in seven special districts were affected by drought, with the mountainous areas being particularly severe. In Inner Mongolia, the land that was not sown or had less than 20% seedling emergence after sowing accounted for more than 40% of the total cultivated land area. In Jiangxi, there was little or no rain in May and June, and there was no rain for a long time from mid-July to early September. Nine special districts experienced drought, some rivers, ponds, and wells dried up, some dry land could not be sown, and the rice seedlings in the sown paddy fields withered. The extent of the disaster and the severity of the damage were unprecedented in decades.

    Several Experiences in Mobilizing the Masses to Fight Drought in Various Regions in 1951

    After the drought occurred in various regions, the Communist Party and the People's Government led the farmers to fight drought as the central task overriding everything else, and launched a widespread anti-drought movement. As a result of the active drought resistance efforts of cadres and the masses, the drought was eliminated in some areas and mitigated in most areas. However, the main shortcomings of the struggle against drought were insufficient vigilance and inadequate preparation before the drought, which wasted a lot of manpower and material resources. The national drought-affected cultivated land still amounted to 35 million mu, and the grain production reduction was more than 8 billion jin, which was a major loss in agricultural production and a serious lesson that we must accept this year. Now, several experiences in mobilizing the masses to fight drought in various regions last year are introduced as follows:

    1. Leading cadres should go deep into the masses to mobilize them and give full play to the power of the masses to fight drought: In drought-stricken areas, party and government leading organs regarded drought resistance as the most urgent task. Leading organs such as the People's Governments of various provinces in North China, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the Central South Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and the CPC Eastern Sichuan Regional Committee immediately issued drought resistance instructions when drought occurred, calling on cadres in drought-stricken areas to stand at the forefront of the drought resistance struggle, overcome all difficulties, and persevere in the drought resistance struggle. In addition to leaving a small number of personnel to work in the organs, special districts and counties all went deep into the districts and townships to arrange, inspect, and promote drought resistance work. The counties, districts, and townships successively convened cadre meetings, farmer representative meetings, labor model meetings, and old farmer symposiums to carry out ideological mobilization, analyze drought conditions, and study drought resistance methods. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, Luo Yuchuan, Vice Chairman of the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government, and Yang Yichen, Chairman of the Liaoxi Provincial People's Government, personally led a large number of cadres to the countryside to lead farmers in drought-resistant sowing, watering seedlings, and developing water conservancy. When the drought began to occur, many farmers in many areas had lucky and paralyzing thoughts such as "People are busy but the sky is not busy, there will be a big rain sooner or later," "A good harvest depends on the sky," and "There will be a big rain after a long drought," or lacked confidence in drought resistance. Even in individual areas, the phenomenon of seeking rain by praying to gods and worshipping Buddha was also found. However, through in-depth publicity and mobilization, by means of specific accounting, complaining about the suffering of drought, etc., the ideas of paralysis, carelessness, and listening to fate were severely criticized; at the same time, farmers were repeatedly educated with effective experiences and typical examples of drought resistance from local or foreign areas, so as to continuously improve farmers' confidence in overcoming drought. After ideological mobilization, the masses were universally mobilized, and a vigorous drought-resistant sowing and seedling protection movement was launched in various regions. In the North China region, the cotton fields that completed drought-resistant planting accounted for 70% of the cotton planting area. In Shaanxi Province, 60,000 wells were dug in three special districts in less than a month. Farmers, workers, troops, teachers, and students in drought-stricken areas in Jiangxi Province were mobilized to participate in the drought resistance struggle. In some areas, temporary canals were dug for forty miles to divert water to irrigate rice fields. In some villages, dozens of women collectively carried water from dozens of miles away to save one mu of rice fields. Some people used water wheels day and night to carry water over mountains and ridges. Under the inspiration of patriotism in increasing production and donating to resist US aggression and aid Korea, the farmers in the Tuanshan District of Shishou County, Hubei Province, automatically organized more than 1,200 people, opened 25 small ditches, and dredged 7 large ditches within five days, completely overcoming the drought. Farmers in Changsha County, Hunan Province, promoted drought resistance work by inspecting patriotic pledges, enabling 95% of the drought-stricken fields in the county to avoid drought. Wuxi Town in the first district of Luxi County was not affected by drought and organized a drought relief support unit to help farmers in neighboring districts with waterwheels.

    2. Meticulously organize manpower and material resources to give full play to the collective strength in fighting drought: Fighting drought is a very arduous task. Many regions educated farmers with the principle that "farmers all over the world are one family" and carried forward the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual aid. At the same time, various mutual assistance and work exchange methods were used to organize all manpower, animal power, full labor, and semi-labor separately, and give full play to collective strength to engage in drought resistance work. For example, Nanchang, Jiangxi, organized 27,600 waterwheels. People did not stop while the waterwheels did not stop, and they took turns working day and night to pump water. They also carried water collectively and relayed water pumping to save 490,000 mu of drought-stricken fields. Farmers in Xiaolan Village not only avoided drought by pumping water over mountains and ridges, but also increased production by 10%. Northern Anhui organized more than 88,000 dragon bone waterwheels to pump water to irrigate seedlings and save rice fields.

    3. Adopt various effective drought resistance measures in accordance with local conditions: (1) Drought-resistant sowing: In order to ensure timely sowing in Hebei, Pingyuan, Chahar and other provinces, the masses in various regions created various different methods of drought-resistant sowing. In order to prevent drought and conserve soil moisture, these areas implemented autumn plowing, deep plowing, fine plowing, fine harrowing, and ridging to store snow after the autumn harvest in the first year; before sowing, they implemented fine harrowing and multiple harrowing to maintain soil moisture; during the sowing period, they adopted methods such as seizing moisture and borrowing moisture to sow, so that the soil around the seeds could provide enough moisture to ensure germination. In areas where there was insufficient moisture in the topsoil and no moisture to borrow, the method of picking water and planting seeds was adopted. Before planting seeds, the seeds were first soaked in water, or sorghum stalks and corn cobs were soaked to be saturated with moisture and sown into the soil together with the seeds. This method used very little water and could ensure seed germination. (2) Develop and utilize all water sources: The fundamental way to overcome drought is to open canals, dig wells, tap springs, build dams to intercept water, dig "through-river wells", and supplement various water lifting tools. These methods played a significant role in the drought resistance struggle in 1951. For example, Zhaowuda League in Inner Mongolia used methods such as opening canals to irrigate land and using various water-holding tools to fetch water to irrigate land in only three banners including Alukeerqin, irrigating more than 6,000 hectares of land. Kailu County in Jerim League called on each laborer to dig a well, and the county dug more than 10,400 wells, irrigating more than 5,000 hectares of land, completely breaking the masses' idea of "natural disasters are irresistible" and establishing the confidence that man can conquer nature. Li Hewang, a labor model in Chaigoupu, Huaian County, Chahar Province, actively led the masses to build water conservancy projects, enabling 13,000 mu of crops to achieve a bumper harvest. Barley yielded 350 jin per mu, and wheat yielded more than 200 jin. In order to fight drought, northern Anhui dug 77,561 wells and 6,000 ponds. During the drought resistance period, Yongshun Special District in Hunan Province renovated and built more than 1,000 ponds, more than 3,800 dams, more than 6,495 ditches and canals, and more than 1,000 water turbine pumps, which could irrigate 140,000 mu of rice fields, accounting for 15% of the total rice field area. (3) Water control: In areas where water sources were available, most areas appointed fair farmers selected from the local water conservancy committee or drought resistance committee to uniformly manage water use, put forward the slogan of "One bowl of water, one bowl of rice" and "Watering one more bucket of water, saving one more life", and called on all farmers to cherish water resources, requiring that not a drop of water be let go and not a drop of water be wasted; at the same time, it called on farmers to overcome the idea of localism, adjust water use with each other, and formulate public agreements, discuss matters publicly, distinguish between priorities and emergencies, first irrigate nearby land, and first save severely drought-stricken fields; when the drought became severe, they concentrated water resources to save the fields that could be saved, so that every drop of water could play its maximum effect.

    一九五一年各地发动群众战胜旱灾的几点基本经验
    徐达
    一九五一年各地干旱情况
    一九五一年三、四两月，长江以北地区，除山东半岛外，普遍少雨，各地雨量仅有历年平均雨量的一半。长江以南，四月雨量过大，约当历年平均雨量的二、三倍。五月除淮河流域外，全国普遍缺雨；华北地区直到五月下旬才下了几场透雨，但不甚普遍。六月份，长江以北广大地区除河北北部和平原省外，依然普遍缺雨，察哈尔、绥远两省、内蒙自治区及西北各省几乎全月无雨，旱象严重。江西、云南、湖南、广西各省雨量也少，吉林、黑龙江、热河、辽西部分地区一直没下透雨。七、八月份河北北部和察哈尔、绥远、内蒙旱象持续。江西、湖南、皖南、皖北旱象也相当严重。
    春夏两季雨水失调，春季北方干旱，南方雨涝，入夏南北都有旱象。受旱地区包括内蒙自治区、察哈尔、绥远、河北、江西、川北等省区的大部地区，山西兴县、忻县两专区，皖北滁县、宿县两专区，皖南池州专区，陕西绥德、榆林专区，湖南西南各县，湖北孝感、宜昌专区，川南乐山、内江、宜宾专区，川东万县专区及吉林、黑龙江、热河、辽西、福建、苏北、山东、广东、贵州等省少数县份，受旱耕地面积共一亿二千五百多万亩。其中内蒙、察哈尔、绥远、河北、江西、川北等地旱灾特别严重。
    察哈尔省六月下旬到七月中旬，正当作物成长季节，旱情严重，受灾面积约占全省耕地五分之二，全省总计因旱减产约五成。绥远省除西部黄河灌溉区外，中部、东部旱灾严重，绥中武川、固阳、清水河等县小麦减产五成，莜麦减产六成，豆类、马铃薯产量更低，绥东大小麦减产三分之二。河北省共有七个专区三千九百多万亩土地受旱，山区尤为严重。内蒙没有播种的土地及播种之后出苗不及二成者，占总耕地面积百分之四十以上。江西五六两月，久晴少雨，七月中旬到九月上旬又历久不雨，九个专区干旱，有些河流池塘和水井干涸，部分旱地不能下种，已播种的水田稻苗干枯，受灾面积之广，灾情之重为数十年所未有。
    一九五一年各地发动群众抗旱的几点经验
    各地旱象发生以后，共产党和人民政府就以抗旱为压倒一切的中心工作领导农民，展开了广泛的抗旱运动。干部和群众积极抗旱的结果，消灭了部分地区的旱灾，减轻了大部地区的旱灾。但是，与旱灾斗争的主要缺点是事前对旱灾的警惕不足，准备不够，耗费了很多人力物力，全国因旱成灾的耕地仍有三千五百万亩，减产粮食在八十亿斤以上，是农业生产上的重大损失，也是我们今年必须接受的一个严重教训。现在把去年各地发动群众抗旱的几点经验介绍如下：
    一、领导干部深入发动群众，发挥群众抗旱力量：在发生旱象的地区，党政领导机关，都把抗旱工作当作最紧迫的工作。华北各省人民政府、内蒙自治区人民政府、西北军政委员会、中南农林部、中共川东区委员会等领导机关，在旱象发生时，立即发布抗旱指示，号召受旱地区的干部站在抗旱斗争的最前线，战胜一切困难，坚持抗旱斗争。专区、县除留少数人员在机关工作外，其余一律深入区乡布置，检查、推动抗旱工作。各县、区、乡接连召开了干部会、农民代表会、劳动模范会、老农座谈会，进行思想动员，分析受旱情况，研究抗旱办法。河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席、平原省人民政府罗玉川副主席、辽西省人民政府杨易辰主席等并亲自率领大批干部下乡，领导农民抗旱播种、浇苗、开发水利。在旱象开始发生时，不少地区的农民有“人忙天不忙，早晚一大场”“丰收靠天顺”“久旱之后必有大雨”等侥幸麻痹的思想，或对抗旱缺乏信心。甚至个别地区还发现求神拜佛迷信求雨的事情。但是通过深入宣传动员，以具体算账、诉旱灾苦等办法，严厉地批判了麻痹大意、听天由命的思想；同时又反覆地以当地或外地的有效经验和抗旱典型事例教育农民，这样就不断提高了农民战胜旱灾的信心。经过思想发动后，群众普遍动员起来，各地先后开展了轰轰烈烈的抗旱播种保苗运动。华北区完成抗旱抢种的棉田占植棉面积的百分之七十。陕西省三个专区不到一个月的时间凿井六万眼。江西省受旱地区的农民、工人、部队、教员、学生都动员起来，参加了抗旱斗争，有的地区临时挖渠四十里，引水浇灌秧田，有的村几十个妇女集体从几十里外，担水抢救一亩稻田，有的日夜接力车水，上山过岗。湖北省石首县团山区农民在抗美援朝增产捐献的爱国热情鼓动下，自动组织起一千二百多人，五天之内开小沟二十五条，疏大沟七条，完全战胜了旱灾。湖南省长沙县农民通过检查爱国公约，推动了抗旱工作，使全县百分之九十五的受旱田地免除旱灾。泸溪县一区武溪镇没有旱灾，组织起抗旱支援部队，到邻区帮助农民车水。
    二、周密组织人力物力，发挥集体抗旱力量：和旱灾作斗争是一件十分艰巨的工作，许多地区一方面用“天下农民是一家”的道理教育农民，发扬互助互济的精神，同时以各种互助变工办法，把一切人力、畜力、整劳力、半劳力分别组织起来，发挥集体力量，从事抗旱工作。如江西南昌组织起水车二万七千六百部，人停车不停，日夜轮班车水，并集体担水，接力车水，抢救受旱田禾四十九万亩。小蓝村农民翻山越岗车水，不仅未受旱灾，反而增产一成。皖北组织起龙骨水车八万八千多架，车水浇苗，抢救秧田。
    三、因地制宜，采用各种有效的抗旱措施：（1）抗旱播种：河北、平原、察哈尔等省，为保证及时播种，各地群众创造了各种不同的抗旱播种的办法。这些地区为了防旱保墒，在第一年秋收后，就实行秋耕深耕、细耕细耙、起垅储雪；播种前实行细耙多耙，保持土壤水分；在播种时期就采用抢墒、借墒等办法播种，使种子周围土壤能供给足够的水分，保证出芽。在墒土不足无墒可借的地区，就采取挑水点种的办法，在点种前先用水把种子泡湿，或把高粱秆、玉茭瓤泡湿，饱含水分，和种籽一齐播入土中，这样用水很少，并能保证种籽出芽。（2）开发利用一切水源：战胜旱灾的根本办法，是开渠、挖井、掏泉、挡坝截水、挖“透河井”、补充各种汲水工具。这些办法在一九五一年的抗旱斗争中，都起了很大作用。例如内蒙昭乌达盟仅在阿鲁科尔沁等三旗就用开渠浇地和利用各种盛水工具打水浇地等办法，浇地六千多垧。哲里木盟开鲁县号召每个劳动力打井一眼，全县打井一万零四百多眼，浇地五千多垧，完全打破了群众“天灾不可抗”的听天由命的想法，确立了人定胜天的信心。察哈尔省怀安县柴沟堡劳动模范李河旺积极领导群众兴修水利，使一万三千亩庄稼获得丰收，大麦每亩收三石五斗，小麦收获二石以上。皖北为抗旱挖井七万七千五百六十一眼，挖塘六千口。湖南永顺专区，在抗旱期间整修和新建塘一千多口，坝三千八百多座，沟渠六千四百九十五条，水筒车一千多架等，可灌溉稻田十四万亩，占稻田总面积百分之十五。（3）管制用水：在有水源可用的地区，各地大多由当地水利委员会或抗旱委员会中选派公正农民统一管理用水，提出“一碗水，一碗稻”、“多浇一挑水，多保一条命”的口号，号召全体农民，珍惜水量，要求不放走一滴水，不浪费一滴水；同时号召农民克服本位主义思想，相互调剂用水，订立公约，大家公议，分别轻重缓急，先浇近地，先救受旱严重的田；到旱灾严重时，则集中水量，抢救可救的田。使每一滴水都发挥最大的效用。
