Xinhua News Agency, February 8th Dispatch from Paris: The Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly closed on February 5th.

At the last plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the 5th, the United States, which had suffered repeated setbacks in this session, suffered a final and crushing defeat. Although the United States, Britain, and other colonial powers stubbornly opposed including the clause on the right to national self-determination in the Human Rights Convention, the plenary meeting overwhelmingly passed the proposal to include the clause on the right to national self-determination in the Human Rights Convention. When this proposal was voted on, the opposing colonial countries only received seven votes; forty-two delegations, including the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, voted in favor, and five delegations abstained. The Associated Press also admitted: "The United States and the colonial countries of the world have suffered an extraordinary defeat in the United Nations."

The Deputy Head of the Soviet delegation, Malik, spoke at the closing meeting, summarizing the work of this session. He first thanked the freedom-loving French people on behalf of the Soviet delegation for their warm hospitality, and especially thanked the French people for the warm and friendly letters they sent to the Soviet Union and other countries' delegations, as well as the many delegations they sent. These letters and delegations expressed their desire for peace and firmly advocated that the General Assembly must pass specific decisions on banning atomic weapons and reducing armaments, and take measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and develop international friendly relations. Malik said: All of this has given us greater encouragement in the struggle for peace and against the threat of war.

Malik said: Due to the opposition of the American bloc, headed by the U.S. delegation, the General Assembly failed to pass any resolutions that would genuinely strengthen world peace and security, halt the expansion of armaments, and ease international tensions. The specific proposals put forward by the Soviet delegation regarding measures to eliminate the threat of another world war and consolidate international peace and friendship were rejected by the U.S.-British bloc, primarily the U.S. and British delegations. Therefore, from the point of view of consolidating peace and security, the Sixth Session of the General Assembly was unsuccessful. Not only that, but the U.S.-British bloc also forced the General Assembly to pass some proposals whose purpose was not to stop but to encourage and expand U.S. aggression. Malik pointed out: The disgraceful failure of the United States and Britain to oppose the inclusion of the clause on the right to national self-determination in the Human Rights Convention shows that the United Nations and the General Assembly, as long as they are sincere, have a way to influence the imperialist colonial countries. At the same time, this also shows that the General Assembly is capable of forcing the U.S. aggressors to stop implementing their aggressive policies and embark on the road of rebuilding normal international relations. Unfortunately, this session of the General Assembly did not take advantage of its methods and opportunities.

    联合国第六届大会闭幕
    马立克严斥美国集团阻挠苏联和平建议
    联大末次会议通过将民族自决权列入人权公约，美英等国又遭到一次惨重的失败
    【新华社八日讯】巴黎消息：联合国第六届大会已在二月五日闭幕。
    在五日举行的大会最后一次全体会议上，在这届大会中屡受挫折的美国又遭到最后一次惨重的失败。虽然美、英等殖民国家顽固地反对在人权公约中列入民族自决权的条款，但是全体会议却以压倒多数通过了将民族自决权条款列入人权公约的提案。在表决这个提案时，反对的殖民国家只获得七票，包括苏联和人民民主国家在内的四十二个代表团投票赞成，五个代表团弃权。合众社也承认：“美国和世界上的殖民国家在联合国里遭到了一个非常的失败。”
    苏联代表团副团长马立克在闭幕会议上发言，总结这届大会的工作。他首先代表苏联代表团感谢爱好自由的法国人民的殷勤招待，并特别感谢法国人民给苏联和其他国家代表团的亲热和友好的信件以及他们所派来的许多代表团，这些信件和代表团都表示要求和平，并坚决主张大会必须通过关于禁止原子武器和裁减军备的具体决定，采取措施消除另一次世界大战的威胁和发展国际友好关系。马立克说：所有这些都使我们在争取和平及反对战争威胁的斗争中得到更大的鼓舞。
    马立克说：由于以美国代表团为首的美国集团的反对，大会未能通过任何真正加强世界和平与安全、停止扩张军备及缓和国际紧张局势的决定。苏联代表团所提出的关于消除另一次世界大战的威胁和巩固国际和平与友好的措施的具体建议，就被美英集团、首先是美国和英国代表团拒绝了。因此，从巩固和平与安全的观点看来，第六届大会是没有成绩的。不但如此，美英集团还强使大会通过了一些提案，其目的不是为了中止而是为了鼓励和扩大美国的侵略。马立克指出：美国和英国反对把民族自决权条款列入人权公约所遭到的可耻失败，说明了联合国和大会只要有诚意，是有办法影响帝国主义殖民国家的。同时，这也说明了大会是有能力迫使美国侵略者不再实行侵略政策，而走上重建正常国际关系的道路的。不幸的是，本届大会没有利用它的办法和机会。
