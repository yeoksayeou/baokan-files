Tianjin private import and export trade merchants, including Qian Haoru, General Manager of Taifeng Import-Export Trading Firm, Shen Erchang, Export Manager, Xu Weixun, Import Manager, Li Weiqing, Manager of Fengchang Firm, Mai Junlin, Deputy Manager and Accountant, Zhang Jiyun, Manager of Xinzhong Company, and Huang Peisheng, Deputy Manager, have consistently used despicable means to corrupt state personnel, steal state economic secrets, massively defraud the state of its assets, and illegally evade and manipulate foreign exchange, traffic in gold and U.S. dollars, and operate "underground banks" to obtain huge illegal profits. After the launch of the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, and anti-fraud of state property movement, the criminals Qian and others not only refused to confess and repent but also concealed evidence and resisted the movement. After investigation and verification by the Tianjin Municipal Committee for Economy Practice and Production Increase, the Tianjin Municipal People's Court has arrested Qian Haoru and the other six criminals and will punish them severely according to the law.

Taifeng Import-Export Trading Firm opened in March 1949, while Fengchang Firm and Xinzhong Company were established before liberation and had no capital. These unscrupulous merchants, under the guise of trading firms, engaged in speculative activities and, through old classmates, colleagues, and "sworn brothers," bribed retained personnel of the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China to obtain state loans and reap exorbitant profits. The criminals Shen Erchang and Mai Junlin used these despicable means to collude with Cai Bingheng, Deputy Section Chief of the Lending Division of the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China, and Zhao Xuegong, Head of the Collateral Group of the Lending Division, turning Cai and Zhao into their "moles" in the state economic organs, defrauding them of large loans. In total, over three years, Taifeng Trading Firm defrauded the Bank of China of 29 billion yuan in loans, and Fengchang Firm defrauded it of 3.2 billion yuan. Taifeng Trading Firm exported only 1,200 tons of peanuts but borrowed U.S. dollars equivalent to 6 billion yuan from the Bank of China, netting an illegal profit of 1.5 billion yuan after deducting all expenses and bank interest.

Taifeng Trading Firm also took advantage of its business operations to defraud the state of its assets and embezzle public funds. For example, in September 1951, when they imported a batch of rubber for the Logistics Department of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the import license specified 300 long tons, but the firm only delivered 300 metric tons, selling the surplus 3.728 metric tons to other rubber factories at high prices. In addition to making a profit of 1.41 billion yuan on this batch of goods, the goods were originally designated for delivery at Dagu Wharf in Tianjin, but later the delivery point was changed to Huangpu Wharf in Shanghai. The criminals Shen Erchang and others, in their utter depravity, still charged insurance fees as if the goods had been unloaded in Tianjin, collecting an excess of 225,900 Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to over 900 million yuan. For another example, the Beijing Grain Company entrusted them with purchasing gunny sacks, with a deposit of over 2.2 billion yuan paid as early as August 31, 1950, stipulating delivery within three months. However, they did not deliver the goods until January 1951, embezzling public funds for a long period. Another way these unscrupulous merchants made exorbitant profits was by luring and corrupting state personnel and stealing state economic secrets. For example, the unscrupulous merchants Zhang Jiyun and Huang Peisheng of Xinzhong Company used feudal "sworn brotherhood" relationships to entice Ni Bangkui (a retained personnel, already arrested), Head of the Foreign Exchange Management Section of the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China, and through Ni's relationship, to lure Lin Guanshan (a retained personnel, arrested for other corruption cases), Head of the Import Group of the Tianjin Foreign Trade Administration Bureau, to steal large amounts of economic secrets. The criminals Ni and Lin showed Zhang Jiyun the trends in foreign exchange rates, the price limits and profits for import and export goods, and internal publications on import and export market information. After learning this information, the criminals Zhang and others engaged in speculation and profiteering.

The criminal Shen Erchang and others also engaged in large-scale illegal activities such as evading foreign exchange and purchasing black market foreign exchange. Taifeng Trading Firm often sent people to Hankou, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and other places to buy black market foreign exchange and constantly smuggled large quantities of U.S. dollars to Hong Kong in export goods. According to incomplete statistics, Taifeng Trading Firm's evaded foreign exchange after 1950 amounted to 1,684,390 Hong Kong dollars. Xinzhong Company also privately solicited foreign exchange and engaged in black market foreign exchange dealings, amounting to as much as 150,000 Hong Kong dollars. In addition, the company openly operated an "underground bank," paying out as much as 800 million yuan in interest in 1951 alone.

The unscrupulous merchants Shen Erchang, Mai Junlin, Zhang Jiyun, and others used these illegal means to obtain large amounts of illegal profits over the past three years. According to preliminary estimates, the illegal profits obtained by Taifeng Trading Firm in the past three years are estimated to be between 15 billion and 20 billion yuan. Zhang Jiyun and others of Xinzhong Company have already confessed that their company's illegal profits amounted to more than 4 billion yuan, with profits in 1951 alone reaching 3.1 billion yuan. The illegal profits obtained by Fengchang Firm cannot be calculated for the time being; in the past two years alone, the firm has arbitrarily squandered 740 million yuan.

In addition, Qian Haoru and others of Taifeng Trading Firm have gradually transferred most of their funds abroad. The aforementioned evaded Hong Kong exchange alone, calculated at the current exchange rate, amounts to more than 6.6 billion yuan.

In these three years, in order to smoothly defraud the state of its assets, Shen and others, through their agents Zhao Xuegong, Cai Bingheng, Ni Bangkui, Lin Guanshan, and other cadres they corrupted and lured within state organs, at least forty or fifty people. In addition to frequent banquets, gifts, playing with dancing girls, and prostituting women, the amount of bribes paid by Fengchang Firm alone, according to incomplete statistics, exceeds 100 million yuan.

    天津泰丰等进出口贸易行诈骗国家巨额资财
    大奸商钱灏如沈尔昌徐为勋等七人被捕
    其中一家就非法获得暴利一百五十亿元以上
    天津市私营进出口贸易业奸商泰丰进出口贸易行总经理钱灏如、出口部经理沈尔昌、进口部经理徐为勋，丰昌行经理李蔚青、副理兼会计麦君麟，辛中公司经理张吉云、副理黄培生等七人，一贯用卑鄙手段腐蚀国家工作人员，偷窃国家经济机密，大量诈骗国家资财，并非法逃汇、套汇、捣卖黄金、美钞，开设“地下钱庄”，获取巨额暴利。在反行贿、反偷税、反诈骗国家财产运动开展后，钱犯等不仅拒不坦白悔过，反而隐匿罪证，抗拒运动。经天津市节约检查委员会调查属实后，已由市人民法院把钱灏如等七犯一并逮捕，将依法严惩。
    泰丰进出口贸易行是一九四九年三月开业的，丰昌行和辛中公司则是解放前成立的，都没有什么资金。这些奸商们打着贸易行的招牌，玩弄投机手段，通过旧的同学、同事、“把兄弟”关系，收买中国银行天津分行的留用人员，骗取国家贷款，牟取暴利。沈尔昌、麦君麟两犯，就是用这种卑鄙手段和中国银行天津分行放款股副股长蔡秉衡、放款股质押组组长赵学恭勾结上，使蔡、赵两人变成他们在国家经济机关的“坐探”，骗取大量贷款。总计三年来，泰丰贸易行就骗取中国银行贷款二百九十亿元，丰昌行骗得贷款三十二亿元。泰丰贸易行仅出口花生米一千二百吨，向中国银行贷借一笔美金折合人民币六十亿元，除出一切费用和银行利息等，即获暴利十五亿元。
    泰丰贸易行并利用业务上的方便，大量诈骗国家的资财，套用公款。如一九五一年九月他们代中国人民解放军某部后勤部进口一批橡胶时，许可证上是三百长吨，实际上该行只交了三百公吨，把多出的三·七二八公吨用高价卖给了其他橡胶厂。他们除在这批货上获取暴利十四亿一千万元外，货物本来规定在天津大沽坝交货，后来改在上海黄浦卸货，沈犯尔昌等竟丧心病狂地仍按原定在天津卸货的情况多收保险费港币二十二万五千九百多元，约折合人民币九亿多元。又如北京粮食公司托他们代购麻袋的定金二十二亿多元，虽早于一九五○年八月三十一日付清，言定三个月内交货，可是他们竟迟至一九五一年一月才交清货物，长期套用了公款。这批奸商另一个牟取暴利的办法，是拉拢、腐蚀国家工作人员，盗窃国家经济机密。如辛中公司奸商张吉云、黄培生，曾利用封建的“把兄弟”关系，勾引中国银行天津分行外汇管理科科长倪邦逵（留用人员，已被捕），并通过倪的关系，拉拢天津对外贸易管理局进口组组长林观善（留用人员，因其他贪污案被捕），大量盗窃经济机密。倪、林二犯曾把外汇牌价的变动趋势、出进口货物的限价与利润、内部刊物出进口商情等给张吉云看，张犯等得知这些情报后，就投机倒把，获取暴利。
    沈犯尔昌等更进行大量的逃汇、购买黑汇等非法行为，泰丰贸易行经常派人到汉口、广州、上海等地买入黑汇，并不断在出口物资中夹带大批美钞去香港。据不完全统计：泰丰贸易行一九五○年以后逃汇数字竟达港币一百六十八万四千三百九十元；辛中公司私自揽收外汇，经营黑汇等勾当也有港币十五万元之多。此外该公司竟公然开设“地下钱庄”，仅在一九五一年内即付出利息八亿之多。
    奸商沈尔昌、麦君麟、张吉云等运用这些非法手段，三年来获得大量暴利。据初步估计：泰丰贸易行近三年来所获的暴利，约在一百五十亿元到二百亿元之间。辛中公司张吉云等已经供认他们这个公司所获暴利达四十多亿元，仅一九五一年盈利就有人民币三十一亿元。丰昌行所获的非法利润，一时无法计算；仅近两年来，该行任意挥霍支出的款项就有七亿四千万元。
    此外，泰丰贸易行钱灏如等还把大部资金陆续逃到国外，仅上述所逃的港汇一项，按目前牌价计算，即达人民币六十六亿多元。
    在这三年中，沈犯等为了顺利地诈骗国家资财，通过他们在国家机关的代理人赵学恭、蔡秉衡、倪邦逵、林观善等所腐蚀、拉拢的干部，至少有四、五十人。除经常请客、送礼、玩舞女、嫖妓女外，仅丰昌行行贿的数字，据不完全统计，在一亿元以上。
