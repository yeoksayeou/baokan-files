Editorial: Strengthening the Work in Old Revolutionary Base Areas

    The broad masses of people in the old revolutionary base areas have made tremendous contributions to the cause of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution. From the Second Revolutionary Civil War until the Third Revolutionary Civil War, or from the War of Resistance Against Japan to the Third Revolutionary Civil War, they devoted enormous manpower, material resources, and financial resources. Under extremely difficult conditions, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they persisted in heroic struggles for more than twenty years or more than ten years. Many old revolutionary base areas even became forward bases for the liberation of the whole country. This indelible and glorious contribution of the people in the old revolutionary base areas is a major factor in promoting the development of Chinese society. Therefore, more than a year after the founding of the People's Republic of China, last summer the Central People's Government, headed by Chairman Mao, dispatched the Southern Old Revolutionary Base Area Visiting Group, composed of 8,413 people, and the Northern Old Revolutionary Base Area Visiting Group, composed of 3,809 people. In about a month, they visited eighteen old revolutionary base areas, including the Jiangxi Old Revolutionary Base Area, the Hunan-Jiangxi border region, the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi region, the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi region, the Hubei-Henan-Anhui region, the Sichuan-Shaanxi border region, eastern Guangdong, Hainan, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Northeast China, Shanxi-Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Shanxi-Suiyuan, Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei, Rehe, Shandong, Henan, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui. Using a combination of general propaganda and key visits, they convened mass meetings in 516 counties, cities, and banners, and convened representative meetings of revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and heroic model figures in counties, cities, and districts. They also held various forums in villages of historical significance and those most devastated by the enemy, commemorated revolutionary martyrs, and conducted individual interviews with model households and model figures. In various meetings and visits, they conveyed Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government's concern for the people in the old revolutionary base areas, publicized the victorious situation of the revolution, reported on the great achievements and bright future of national construction over the past two years, and listened to the opinions and demands of the people in the old revolutionary base areas; they also presented gifts, conducted cultural and recreational activities, and provided medical services. The masses attending the various meetings convened by the visiting groups were extremely jubilant. The 2,842 mass meetings convened by the Northern Old Revolutionary Base Area Visiting Group alone were attended by more than 5.23 million people. After the visits, the people in the old revolutionary base areas sent 699 representatives to Beijing to participate in the National Day celebrations, attended the 1951 National Day ceremony, attended Chairman Mao's reception, met with leaders of the Central Government, listened to reports by Premier Zhou and other leaders of the Central Government, and visited factories, farms, various exhibitions, and scenic spots in Beijing. This greatly strengthened the ties between the Central People's Government and all levels of people's governments and the people in the old revolutionary base areas, enhanced the enthusiasm of the people in the old revolutionary base areas for loving and building the motherland, and provided more favorable conditions for strengthening the work in the old revolutionary base areas in the future.
    Regarding the work in the old revolutionary base areas, such as economic construction, culture and education, medical and health care, and preferential treatment, the people in the old revolutionary base areas have put forward their own opinions and demands, and raised many urgent problems to be solved. The central link in solving these problems is to develop economic construction. In this regard, the State Council of the Central People's Government has already determined the guiding principles and methods in the "Instructions on Strengthening the Work in Old Revolutionary Base Areas," namely, "Combining the solution of the current livelihood difficulties of the masses with long-term construction, proceeding from local conditions, and restoring and developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production in a planned and focused manner." The people's governments of all relevant regions must earnestly implement these instructions. In the past, much work has generally been done to solve the current livelihood difficulties of the people in the old revolutionary base areas, and considerable achievements have been made; however, the perspective of long-term construction is not clear enough, and some even have no long-term plans at all, which is not right. Because during the long-term struggle against the enemy, the people in the old revolutionary base areas suffered severe devastation from the enemy. In Ningdu County, Jiangxi Province alone, 8,334 households were exterminated; in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, 14,000 cadres were killed and 120,000 people were killed; in the old areas of Hainan Island, entire villages were wiped out; and between Xin County, Henan Province, and Macheng and Luotian, Hubei Province, eighty miles were completely burned down, and the no-man's land created by the enemy's scorched-earth policy lasted for as long as six years. This has resulted in many old revolutionary base areas not yet having their populations restored, and livestock and agricultural tools being extremely lacking due to massive losses. Some places have even become wildernesses, with wild animals roaming in droves. On such an extremely dilapidated foundation, without the perspective of long-term construction, or attempting to completely restore everything at once, is impossible or unable to solve the fundamental problems. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome the purely relief-oriented viewpoint, overcome the style of temporary crash programs, and give constant attention to the work in the old revolutionary base areas according to the specific circumstances of each place, and restore and develop the local economic construction step by step. However, this does not mean that we can ignore the current livelihood difficulties of the masses. For example, phenomena such as the lack of housing and clothing in some places, and even people begging for food, must be eliminated in a timely manner.
    From the perspective of organizational work, the key to strengthening the work in the old revolutionary base areas is to strengthen leadership, rely on the masses, strengthen cadre work, and earnestly implement the policies, laws, and instructions of the Central People's Government. Regarding strengthening leadership and relying on the masses, the State Council of the Central People's Government has already made clear provisions in the "Instructions on Strengthening the Work in Old Revolutionary Base Areas," and the relevant levels of people's governments should implement them accordingly. As for strengthening cadre work, first of all, a large number of local cadres should be cultivated in all aspects, the political and cultural education of in-service cadres should be strengthened, the phenomenon of impure ideological style of some cadres should be overcome, and the cultural level of cadres should be emphatically improved. At the same time, the provincial people's governments should appropriately allocate a group of young intellectuals from other places according to local conditions to assist the various tasks in the old revolutionary base areas; and re-employ some promising retired personnel to participate in the work. For backward personnel, the local governments should take the initiative to contact them, unite them, and strive for their participation in the work or give them opportunities to study. Only in this way can we guarantee that there is sufficient strength to promote the development of various construction undertakings.
    Regarding the implementation of the relevant policies, laws, and instructions of the Central People's Government, the relevant levels of government should pay greater attention to it. The Central People's Government has made a number of decisions and instructions regarding the work in the old revolutionary base areas in the past, but they have not been truly implemented in many places. On December 11th of last year, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government, in its "Instructions on Inspecting and Conducting Preferential Treatment Work Before and After the Spring Festival," specifically proposed to earnestly inspect the preferential treatment work in the old revolutionary base areas. The relevant levels of people's governments should immediately conduct a thorough inspection of the preferential treatment work in the old revolutionary base areas and its progress based on the instructions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and improve this work. Other work related to the old revolutionary base areas should also be improved after inspection, distinguishing between priorities and urgencies.
    The relevant levels of people's governments must strengthen their leadership over the work in the old revolutionary base areas and provide practical assistance to the people in the old revolutionary base areas in terms of economy and culture and education, in order to overcome their difficulties in various aspects within three to five years and gradually put them on the road to prosperity in both people and wealth and developed culture.

### 加强老根据地的工作

    加强老根据地的工作
    在中国人民民主革命事业中，老根据地的广大人民，是有巨大贡献的。他们从第二次国内革命战争直到第三次国内革命战争，或从抗日战争到第三次国内革命战争，都付出了巨大的人力、物力和财力，在极端困难的条件下，在中国共产党的领导下，坚持了二十多年或十多年的英勇斗争，许多老根据地并成为解放全国的前进基地。老根据地人民的这种不可磨灭的光辉贡献，乃是推动中国社会发展的重大因素。因此，当中华人民共和国成立一年多之后，以毛主席为首的中央人民政府，就在去年夏天派出了由八千四百一十三人组成的南方老根据地访问团、由三千八百零九人组成的北方老根据地访问团，在一个月左右的时间里，遍访了江西老根据地、湘赣边、湘鄂赣、闽浙赣、鄂豫皖、川陕边、粤东、海南、陕甘宁、东北、晋冀鲁豫、晋绥、晋察冀、热河、山东、河南、苏北和皖北等十八个老根据地，用普遍宣传和重点访问相结合的方法，在五百一十六个县、市、旗召开了群众大会，召开了县、市、区的革命烈士和革命军人家属、革命残废军人、英雄模范人物的代表会议，并在有历史意义和遭受敌人摧残最重的乡村召开各种座谈会，祭悼革命烈士，对典型户和典型人物作了个别访问。在各种会议和访问中，传达了毛主席和中央人民政府对老根据地人民的关怀之情，宣传了革命的胜利形势，报告了两年来国家建设的伟大成就和远大前途，听取了老根据地人民的意见和要求；并赠送了礼品，进行了文化娱乐活动和医疗工作。在访问团召开的各种会议上，到会群众都极为欢跃。仅北方老根据地访问团召开的二千八百四十二次群众大会，就有五百二十三万多人参加。在访问结束以后，老根据地人民派出了六百九十九位来京参加国庆观礼的代表，参加了一九五一年的国庆典礼，出席了毛主席的招待会，会见了中央各首长，听到了周总理和中央其他首长的报告，参观了工厂、农场、各种展览会和北京名胜。这就大大加强了中央人民政府及各级人民政府和老根据地人民的联系，提高了老根据地人民爱护祖国和建设祖国的热情，为今后加强老根据地的工作，提供了更加有利的条件。
    关于老根据地的工作，诸如经济建设、文化教育、医药卫生、优抚工作等等，老根据地人民都提出了自己的意见和要求，并提出了许多迫待解决的问题。解决这些问题的中心环节是发展经济建设事业。在这一方面，中央人民政府政务院已在“关于加强老根据地工作的指示”中，确定了方针和方法，即“本解决群众当前生活困难与长期建设相结合的方针，因地制宜，有计划地有重点地逐步恢复与发展农林畜牧与副业生产”。各有关地区的人民政府，必须认真贯彻这一指示。过去，对于解决老根据地人民的当前生活困难，一般都作了许多工作，并已得到相当的成绩；但是长期建设的观点还不够明确，有的则根本没有长期打算，这是不对的。因为在长期的对敌斗争中，老根据地人民曾遭受了敌人的严重摧残。仅江西省宁都一县，被杀绝的就有八千三百三十四户；湖南省平江县的干部被杀一万四千人，群众被杀十二万人；海南岛老区有的一村全被杀光；而从河南省新县到湖北省麻城、罗田之间，八十里则全被烧光，敌人的这种烧光政策所造成的无人区，曾延续达六年之久。这就使得许多老根据地至今人口尚未恢复，畜力、农具因大量损失而极感缺乏，有些地方甚至变成了一片荒野，野兽成群。在这样的极端残破的基础上，如果没有长期建设的观点，或者企图一下子完全恢复起来，都是不可能的或不能解决根本问题的。因此，必须克服单纯救济观点，克服临时突击的作风，必须按照各地的具体情况，对老根据地的工作给以经常的注意，有步骤地恢复和发展当地的经济建设。但是，这决不是说可以不管群众当前的生活困难。就像有些地方，无房住、无衣穿的现象，甚至还有人讨饭的现象，是必须及时加以消灭的。
    从组织工作方面来说，加强老根据地工作的关键是加强领导，依靠群众，加强干部工作，切实贯彻中央人民政府的政策、法令和指示。关于加强领导和依靠群众，中央人民政府政务院在“关于加强老根据地工作的指示”中，已经作了明确规定，有关的各级人民政府应即按照执行。至于加强干部工作，首先应该从各方面培养大批的本地干部，加强在职干部的政治、文化教育，克服某些干部思想作风不纯的现象，并着重地提高干部的文化水平。同时，应该由省人民政府按照当地情况，适当配备一批外地的青年知识分子，协助老根据地的各项工作；并起用一些有为的退休人员参加工作。对于落伍的人员，地方政府应该主动地与之联系，团结他们，争取他们参加工作或给以学习的机会。这样才能保证有足够的力量，推动各项建设事业的发展。
    关于贯彻中央人民政府有关的政策、法令和指示，应该引起有关的各级政府更大的注意。对于老根据地的工作，中央人民政府过去已有若干决定和指示，但在许多地方还没有真正贯彻执行。去年十二月十一日，中央人民政府内务部在“关于春节前后检查与进行优抚工作的指示”中，又特别提出认真检查老根据地的优抚工作。有关的各级人民政府即应根据内务部的指示，对于老根据地的优抚工作及其进行情况，切实作一检查，并把这一工作提高一步。其他的有关老根据地的工作也应该分别轻重缓急，经过检查，求得改进。
    有关的各级人民政府必须加强对老根据地工作的领导，从经济和文化教育等方面，给老根据地人民以切实的扶助，以争取在三、五年内克服其各方面的困难，使他们逐步走上人财两旺、文化发达的道路。
