    Suburbs of Taiyuan City Merge Canals and Abolish Feudal Monopoly System; Water Saved Can Expand Irrigation Area by More Than 20,000 Mu
    The drought prevention and water conservancy efforts in the suburbs of Taiyuan City have made great progress in the past two months. Abolishing the feudal monopoly system and merging canals alone can expand the irrigation area by more than 20,000 mu.
    At the first Taiyuan City Suburban Water Conservancy Representative Conference held in mid-December last year, after research and discussion, it was found that the feudal monopoly and unreasonable feudal remnants in water conservancy work were quite serious, greatly hindering the development of agricultural production. For example, some management personnel of the Xiangyang Canal in the Third District monopolized water rights, and the masses had to pay them to buy water in order to irrigate their land. Due to this feudal monopoly, more than 1,700 mu of irrigated land in Beigu Nian Village became dry land. Waste was also quite serious. In the Ruicheng Village canal in the Fifth District, the canal head was changed every year with great fanfare, feasting and drinking. This year's replacement cost 2.59 million yuan in Renminbi. Such waste was common in all canals. Most of the canal heads were not democratically elected, but were appointed in rotation by a few powerful people. For example, the head of the Fengzhong Canal was held by Nantun and Nanyan each for one year; whichever village held the position of canal head, that village would irrigate first. This led to disunity between villages, with upstream villages controlling downstream villages, and large villages controlling small villages. In order to reform this unreasonable feudal system, the conference decided to abolish the feudal monopoly system in river and canal water use, establish and improve a rational democratic management system, achieve rational water use, and maximize the potential of water. The water conservancy representatives unanimously stated that after returning to their respective districts and villages, they would mobilize the masses to abolish the feudal monopoly system, run water conservancy projects well, increase production, and create greater wealth for the country.
    After the water conservancy representatives returned to their districts and villages, in addition to conveying the spirit of the water conservancy representative conference at various occasions, they also took the lead in consulting with the masses to abolish the remaining feudal monopoly system and merge unreasonable canals. The people who had long suffered from the feudal monopoly expressed their great approval. Many people said, "The canals in the past were too scattered, which not only made management difficult and affected irrigation and increased production, but also easily caused disputes and disunity among the villages. Merging is a good way." Therefore, they demanded that each river and canal implement unified management and unified allocation of water. The entire suburban area originally had thirty-six earthen canals, which are now merged into twelve large canals. Through this method, it is easier to control and manage, and it can move from decentralization to collectivism, so the upstream and downstream villages are united, and the large villages no longer control the small villages, and the expenses of the village canals are greatly reduced. In particular, after unified water use, due to rational water use, the potential irrigation efficiency of water has been maximized, and the water saved alone can expand the irrigation area by more than 20,000 mu. Calculated on the basis of an increase of one dan of grain per mu, it can increase grain production by more than 20,000 dan. This has laid a good foundation for this year's farmland water conservancy construction and drought prevention and moisture preservation campaign.

    太原市郊区合并渠道废除封建把持制度
    节约下的水量能扩大灌溉面积两万多亩
    太原市郊区防旱水利事业，两月来有了很大发展。只废除封建把持制度、合并渠道一项，就可扩大灌溉面积二万多亩。
    在去年十二月中旬召开的太原市郊区首届水利代表会议上，经过研究讨论，检查出水利工作上的封建把持和不合理的封建残余制度相当严重，大大地阻碍着农业生产的发展。例如三区向阳渠某些管理人员，把持水权，群众要浇地，还得拿钱向他们买水。由于这种封建把持，北固碾村的一千七百多亩水地变成了旱地。浪费现象也相当严重。五区芮城村水渠，每年更换一次渠长，锣鼓喧天，大吃大喝。今年更换时就花了人民币二百五十九万元。这种浪费现象，各水渠都普遍存在。大部分渠长不是民主选举出来的，而是几个有势力的人轮流担任。如凤中渠渠长是南屯、南堰各担任一年；那村担任渠长，那村就先浇地。因此就形成了村和村之间不团结，上村卡下村，大村卡小村的现象。为了改革这种不合理的封建制度，会议决定废除在河渠用水上的封建把持制度，建立和健全合理的民主管理制度，做到合理用水，发挥水的潜在力。水利代表们一致表示：回去以后，要发动群众废除封建把持制，办好水利事业，增加生产，为国家创造更大的财富。
    水利代表们回到了自己的区、村后，除了在各种场合传达了水利代表会决议的精神外，又积极带头和群众商量，废除残余的封建把持制度，合并不合理的渠道。久受封建把持痛苦的人民极表赞同。不少人说：“过去的渠道太分散啦，不但管理困难，影响浇地增产，而且容易发生纠纷，各村闹不团结。合并就是好办法。”因而纷纷要求各河渠实行统一管理、统一调动用水的办法。全郊区原有三十六道泥渠，现在并为十二道大渠。通过这种办法，既好掌握管理，又可由分散走向集体，因而上下村团结了，大村也不卡制小村了，村渠的开支也大大减少了。特别是统一用水以后，由于合理用水，发挥了水的潜在灌溉效能，只节约下的水就能扩大灌溉面积二万多亩。每亩以增产一石粮食计算，就可增产粮二万多石。这就给今年兴修农田水利和防旱保墒运动奠定了良好的基础。
