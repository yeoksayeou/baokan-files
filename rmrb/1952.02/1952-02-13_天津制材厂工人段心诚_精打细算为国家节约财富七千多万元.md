    Tianjin Lumber Mill Worker Duan Xincheng
    Carefully Calculates and Saves the Country Over 70 Million Yuan in Wealth

    To the Editor: Duan Xincheng, a wood saw foreman at the Tianjin Lumber Mill of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, loves state property. When the Tianjin Vehicle Factory of the Tianjin Railway Bureau came to the Tianjin Lumber Mill to saw six-meter-long large planks for repairing carriages, he carefully thought: Repairing carriages doesn't necessarily require six-meter-long wooden boards; shorter ones would also work. Therefore, he raised his suggestion to the leadership of the Tianjin Lumber Mill. The leadership adopted his suggestion. As a result, the planking sawn from two-meter to five-meter long wooden boards were all suitable. His suggestion saved the country more than sixty meters of six-meter-long logs, worth over 70 million yuan in Renminbi. Duan Xincheng's spirit of careful calculation and cherishing state property is a concrete manifestation of responding to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and thrift, and is worthy of everyone's learning.

    天津制材厂工人段心诚
    精打细算为国家节约财富七千多万元
    编辑同志：天津铁路管理局天津制材厂木锯工长段心诚热爱国家财产，当着天津铁路管理局天津车辆工厂到天津制材厂锯六米长的修车大板时，他就仔细地想：修车不一定用六米长的木板，短些也是可以的。于是他把他的意见提到天津制材厂的领导方面。领导方面采纳了他的意见。结果，用二米到五米长的木板合锯出来的板皮都很合用。他的建议给国家节约了六米长原木六十多米，价值人民币七千多万元。段心诚这种精打细算，爱护国家财产的精神是响应毛主席增产节约号召的具体表现，值得大家学习。  王振武
