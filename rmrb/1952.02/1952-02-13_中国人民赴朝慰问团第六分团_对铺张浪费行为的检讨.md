In response to criticism and suggestions from People's Daily readers:

To the Editor:

The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 31st published Zhao Guannong's criticism of the extravagant and wasteful phenomena of the Sixth Sub-Group of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea. We sincerely accept this criticism. When we were giving reports in the eastern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there were indeed instances of extravagance and wastefulness in various places in order to entertain us. And although we verbally said some "polite words" like "we're all family, no need to be like this" every time we arrived in a place, we agreed with their actions in our minds. We mistakenly believed that their hospitality did not exceed the standards of the hospitality received by the delegation in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shenyang, and therefore did not strictly dissuade the extravagance and wastefulness that occurred in the hospitality of various places, thereby fueling this phenomenon of extravagance and wastefulness. In the course of our work, the situation of individual members not cherishing public property was indeed very serious. For example, some comrades only ate the heart of the watermelon; they threw away half-smoked cigarettes, and so on. Although the bulk of the gifts given to us by the people of various places were donated to airplanes and cannons and to comfort the families of martyrs and soldiers, we also accepted things such as towels, soap, toothpaste, underwear, and fountain pens, which was very wrong. Even more serious was that a few members even took the mushrooms and fungus given to us by the people of various places to the streets to sell, leaving a very bad impression on the masses. Although the leadership had made some criticisms and education on the bad behavior of individual members, it was far from enough, and the leadership should be responsible for this.

In addition, there was also a great deal of waste within our sub-group. According to preliminary statistics, more than 10 million yuan was wasted (we have appointed a special person to further check the detailed waste situation and whether there are any problems in the accounts). At that time, we thought that we had saved a lot according to the original budget (according to the overall budget, our delegation saved more than 90 million yuan), and it would not matter if we spent a little more, which was the main reason for the waste. This shows that we are very lacking in the concept of cherishing state property. This is a very serious mistake.

Zhao Guannong's criticism has been of great help to us. However, there are individual places that do not match the facts. For example, the hospitality in Hailar City, Hulunbuir League, was not good, and individual members expressed dissatisfaction, which was wrong; but no one said "What kind of government is this!" Furthermore, the time we worked in various places was in accordance with the scheduled agenda, and the extension or shortening of working time was not determined by the quality of the hospitality.

### 中国人民赴朝慰问团第六分团  对铺张浪费行为的检讨

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中国人民赴朝慰问团第六分团
    对铺张浪费行为的检讨
    编辑同志：一月三十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏登载了赵冠农同志对赴朝慰问团第六分团铺张浪费现象的批评，我们诚恳接受这个批评。我们在内蒙古自治区东部进行传达报告时，各地为了招待我们，的确发生过铺张浪费现象。而我们每到一地，虽然在口头上也曾说了一些“都是家里人，不必如此”等“客气话”，但在思想上是同意他们的作法的。我们错误地认为他们的招待并没有超过慰问团在北京、天津、沈阳所受的招待的标准，因而对于各地在招待中发生的铺张浪费行为，没有予以严格劝止，从而助长了这种铺张浪费的现象。在工作过程中，个别团员不爱护公家财物的情况也确很严重。譬如有的同志吃西瓜只吃西瓜心；吸香烟剩下半截就扔掉了等等。各地人民送给我们的慰问物品，虽然大宗的都捐献了飞机大炮和慰问了烈属军属，但我们也接受了如毛巾、肥皂、牙膏、卫生衣、水笔等类的东西，这也是很不应该的。更严重的是，少数团员还拿着各地人民送给我们的蘑菇、木耳等到街上去卖，给群众留下了很恶劣的印象。对个别团员的这种不良作风，领导方面虽然也进行了一些批评和教育，但很不够，这应由领导方面负责。
    另外，在我们分团内部也存在着很大的浪费现象。据初步统计，共浪费了一千万元以上（关于详细浪费情况和账目中有无问题，我们已指定了专人进一步检查）。我们当时以为按照原来的预算，已经节省了不少（依照总的预算，我团共节省了九千多万元），就是多化一点也没有什么，这是发生浪费现象的主要原因。这就说明了我们十分缺乏爱护国家财产的观念。这是十分严重的错误。
    赵冠农同志的批评，对于我们有很大帮助。但其中有个别地方与事实不符。如呼纳盟海拉尔市招待的不好，个别团员曾经表示不满，这是错误的；但没有人说“这是什么政府！”再，我们在各地工作的时间，都是按照预定日程进行，延长或缩短工作时间，并不是看招待好坏来决定。
