Xinhua News Agency Report: Paris Dispatch: As the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly nears its end, the American delegation has exhausted all illegal and despicable means to obstruct the Assembly from discussing the Korean issue. However, this behavior of the American delegation only fully exposes how isolated, helpless, and embarrassed the American imperialism, which has been completely defeated on the Korean battlefield, is within the United Nations.

　　This session of the General Assembly, in its initial decision on the agenda, had already approved placing the "Korean Independence" issue on the agenda of the First (Political and Security) Committee, and the "Korean Reconstruction" issue on the agenda of the mixed committee of the Second (Economic and Financial) and Third (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural) Committees. Both of these agendas were originally proposed by the American delegation at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 1950. The United States initially raised these issues because it was confident that its dream of occupying all of Korea could soon be realized. Therefore, it hoped to then force the United Nations to accept its plan to rule Korea long-term and further expand its aggression in the Far East. However, a year later, this dream of the United States has been shattered by the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, and it has been forced to negotiate an armistice with the Chinese and Korean people. But, in the process of the armistice negotiations, it attempted to indefinitely delay the realization of a Korean armistice and arrange for the next stage of its aggressive actions in the Far East. Under these circumstances, if the United Nations General Assembly were to discuss the Korean issue again, it would expose this conspiracy of the United States to the whole world. And at this United Nations General Assembly, many delegations have expressed their desire for the United Nations to participate in the negotiations to accelerate the realization of an armistice in Korea. Therefore, the United States, which a year ago was smugly demanding that the United Nations General Assembly discuss the Korean issue, now feels extremely terrified and has to desperately obstruct this session of the General Assembly from discussing the Korean issue. This extremely significant shift powerfully illustrates how significant the changes have been in the situation over the past year, from the Korean battlefield to the United Nations arena.

　　However, the American delegation has no basis to stop the Assembly from discussing this agenda item. As early as January 9th, in the Political Committee, the American representative had suggested "postponing" the discussion of this agenda item, but the legal procedures to prevent this session of the Assembly from discussing this item were not yet completed. Therefore, on February 5th, at the final meeting of this session of the Assembly, the United States colluded with Britain and France to present an illegal proposal to the Assembly,妄想妄想繞過總務委員會而變更大會的議程,妄想 to circumvent the General Committee and change the agenda of the Assembly, demanding that the Assembly avoid "untimely consideration" of the Korean issue, and demanding that the Korean issue be shelved indefinitely, until the United States deems it necessary to convene a special session of the Assembly to consider it. Under the strong manipulation of the United States, disregarding the solemn opposition of the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, the Assembly actually passed this illegal proposal.

　　Although the United States has brutally raped the will of the United Nations, it has had to pay a high price for this politically and morally. In order to present its proposal to the plenary session of the Assembly, the United States, Britain, and France illegally convened a "Joint Meeting of the First Committee and the Mixed Committee of the Second and Third Committees" on the 2nd, to first pass this proposal. At this meeting, representatives of the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Lebanon spoke out to denounce the United States for convening this meeting illegally. Soviet representative Malik pointed out that this meeting was not established in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter, by a recommendation from the General Committee and a decision by the Assembly, but was convened at the behest of the United States, Britain, and France. This shows that at the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, in addition to the organs stipulated by the Charter and the rules of procedure, there are also organs that are not stipulated by the Charter and the rules of procedure, and which are performing duties. This organ can be called the "Black Cabinet," which is composed of representatives of the United States, Britain, and France. The Lebanese representative also requested the General Committee to investigate on what basis this joint meeting was convened.

　　At the plenary session of the Assembly on February 5th, Soviet representative Malik delivered a long speech, solemnly revealing that the United States is afraid of discussing the Korean issue at the Assembly because it is afraid of facing world opinion, afraid of taking responsibility for its aggression against the Korean people, afraid of taking responsibility for its actions in Korea, afraid of taking responsibility for its consistent delays in the armistice negotiations, and afraid of taking responsibility for its policy and plan of expanding aggression in the Far East.

### 中朝部队粉碎了美国侵占全朝鲜的梦想  美国惊恐万分拚命阻挠联大讨论朝鲜问题

    中朝部队粉碎了美国侵占全朝鲜的梦想
    美国惊恐万分拚命阻挠联大讨论朝鲜问题
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：巴黎消息：在联合国第六届大会临近结束的时候，美国代表团用尽了一切非法的、卑鄙的手段，阻挠了本届大会讨论朝鲜问题。但是，美国代表团这种行为只是充分暴露了在朝鲜战场上已经完全失败了的美帝国主义，在联合国内是如何孤立无助，如何狼狈。
    本届大会在最初决定大会议程时已通过把“朝鲜独立”问题列入第一（政治与安全）委员会的议程，把“朝鲜复兴”问题列入第二（经济与财政）和第三（社会、人道与文化）委员会混合委员会的议程。这两项议程原来都是美国代表团在一九五○年联合国第五届大会上提出来的。美国当初提出这个问题的目的，是因为它满以为占领全朝鲜的梦想很快可以实现，因此希望可以接着迫使联合国接受其长期统治朝鲜并在远东进一步扩大侵略的计划。但是，事隔一年，美国的这种梦想已被朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军打得粉碎，它已被迫和中朝人民谈判停战。但在停战谈判的过程中，它又企图无限期地拖延朝鲜停战之实现，并布置在远东进行下一步的侵略行动。在这种情形下，如果联合国大会再来讨论朝鲜问题，就将使美国的这种阴谋在全世界面前暴露无遗。而在这次联合国大会上，已经有许多代表团表示了要求联合国参与谈判以加速在朝鲜实现停战的意愿。因此，在一年前踌躇满志地要求联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题的美国，现在竟感到极度惊恐，而不得不拚命阻挠本届大会讨论朝鲜问题。这一个极有意义的转变，有力地说明了一年以来从朝鲜战场上到联合国会场上，形势已有了何等重大的变化。
    但是，美国代表团要停止大会讨论这项议程是没有根据的。早在一月九日的政治委员会上，美国代表就曾建议“延期”讨论这项议程，但是要使本届大会不讨论这项议程的法律程序仍未完成。因此，在二月五日本届大会的末次会议上，美国就纠集英法两国向大会提出一项非法提案，妄想绕过总务委员会而变更大会的议程，要求大会对朝鲜问题避免作“时机尚未成熟的审议”，要求把朝鲜问题无限期地搁置起来，一直到美国认为有需要的时候再召集大会特别会议审议。在美国强力操纵之下，不顾苏联与人民民主国家的严正反对，大会竟通过了这个非法提案。
    虽然美国粗暴地强奸了联合国的意志，美国却不得不为此在政治上和道义上付出昂贵的代价。为了要向大会全体会议提出自己的提案，美英法三国曾在二日非法召开了一次“第一委员会与第二和第三委员会混合委员会联席会议”，先行通过了这个提案。在这次会议上，苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰、白俄罗斯和黎巴嫩的代表曾发言斥责美国召开这个会议是非法的。苏联代表马立克指出：这个会议不是按联合国宪章的规定由总务委员会提出建议，经大会作出决定而成立的，而是在美、英、法三国的吩咐下召开的。这表明了，在联合国大会第六届会议上，除了宪章和议事规则所规定的机构以外，还有宪章和议事规则都不曾规定的机构存在着，并且执行着职务。这个机构可以叫做“黑内阁”，它是由美英法三国代表组成的。黎巴嫩代表也请求总务委员会调查清楚，召开这个联席会议到底有何根据。
    在二月五日大会全体会议上，苏联代表马立克发表长篇演说，严正地揭露了美国害怕在大会上讨论朝鲜问题，因为它害怕面对世界舆论，害怕承担它侵略朝鲜人民的责任、承担它在朝鲜的行动的责任、承担它一贯拖延停战谈判的责任和承担它在远东扩大侵略的政策和计划的责任。
