    【This Newspaper Dispatches】 Readers of this newspaper have written to express their angry protests against the British imperialists' unreasonable persecution of our compatriots and patriotic film workers in Hong Kong. From January 21st to February 11th, this newspaper received a total of thirty-seven letters from soldiers, workers, cadres, students, ordinary residents, and overseas Chinese youth from all over the country. In their letters, readers unanimously expressed their great anger at the atrocities of British imperialism, and firmly supported the protest statements of the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government and various national people's organizations. Readers believe that the British imperialists' atrocities in Hong Kong are a blatant manifestation of the British government's further submission to US imperialism and hostility towards our country.
    Many readers believe that the Chinese people, who have already stood up, certainly have the strength to smash any provocative acts of imperialism. They also expressed their intention to work hard to increase production and practice economy, strengthen the resistance against US aggression and aid Korea, and strengthen our motherland's national defense and economic strength, using actions to strike at the imperialists' aggressive conspiracies.

    许多读者认为：已经站立起来的中国人民，一定有力量能够粉碎帝国主义的任何挑衅行为。他们并表示要努力增产节约，加强抗美援朝，加强我们祖国的国防力量和经济力量，用行动来打击帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
