To the Editors:

The Suihua and Jiamusi sub-committees of the China Railway Trade Union have, for a long time, accumulated comfort goods and comfort money intended for railway workers慰问 (comforting/supporting) the Chinese People's Volunteers and aid-Korea workers. They have misused these items and funds, and the accounting is extremely chaotic. For example, the Suihua sub-committee had ten million yuan (Northeast currency) in comfort money in December 1950. According to the books, this money has been handed over, but there is no receipt. Another three million three hundred thousand yuan (RMB) in comfort money was simply handed over to the trade union for disposal. In September 1951, the sub-committee lent two million yuan (RMB) in comfort money to the Housing Property Committee, which has not been recovered to this day, and the person in charge of borrowing the money cannot be found. The Jiamusi sub-committee's handling of comfort money is also very chaotic, with no accounts to check and no one specifically responsible. They allocated comfort money to the theater troupe as operating expenses, entertainment expenses, and bonuses, to buy bicycles and office furniture, and even arbitrarily lent it to private individuals for use. The Suihua sub-committee even took the liberty of using comfort goods, taking 69 towels and 21 tubes of toothpaste as prizes for playing poker competitions, and using toothpaste, toothbrushes, and notebooks as canteen prizes. In addition, the sub-committee used 15 boxes of cigarettes for meetings, and Guo, the vice-chairman of the committee, took 30 boxes of cigarettes and gave them to his wife (he only recently paid for them in compensation). He Tieran, the labor protection cadre, also took 20 boxes of cigarettes. Some sub-committees have serious corruption and waste. For example, Li Guoren, an accountant with the Jiamusi sub-committee, embezzled 23 million yuan RMB in labor protection funds, and Yang Bocen, an inspector, embezzled 850,000 yuan RMB in cultural and educational funds. The Sankeshu Rolling Stock Depot Trade Union has been stealing and selling items from the station since 1949; some people use public coal and water to boil water and then sell it back to the public (selling it on the train). These situations have aroused widespread dissatisfaction among the workers. We suggest that the Northeast Regional Committee of the China Railway Trade Union seriously and conscientiously handle these issues, and that the leadership of the Suihua and Jiamusi sub-committees make a public and profound self-criticism.

    绥化、佳木斯
    铁路工会委员会乱用慰问品慰问金
    编辑同志：中国铁路工会绥化、佳木斯两分区委员会，长期积压铁路职工慰问中国人民志愿军和援朝职工的慰问品、慰问金，并随便使用，账目十分混乱。如绥化分区委员会，在一九五○年十二月存有慰问金一千万元（东北币），按账来查，已经交出，但没有收据。另有慰问金三百三十多万元（人民币），却随便交给工会处理了。该分会一九五一年九月借给房产委员会慰问金二百万元（人民币），至今没有收回，并且找不到借钱的负责人。佳木斯分区委员会对慰问金的处理也很混乱，既无账可查，又无专人负责。他们把慰问金拨给剧团作经费、招待费和奖金，买自行车和办公家具，甚至任意借给私人使用。绥化分区委员会并擅自动用慰问品，拿了毛巾六十九条，牙膏二十一支作为打扑克竞赛奖励用，用牙膏、牙刷、笔记本作为食堂奖品。此外，分区委员会开会用烟十五盒，该会郭副主席拿了三十盒烟，给了他爱人（最近才给了钱赔偿），劳保干事何铁然也拿了二十盒烟。某些分会有严重的贪污浪费现象。如佳木斯分区委员会会计员李国仁贪污劳保费人民币二千三百万元，巡视员杨伯臣贪污文教费人民币八十五万元。三棵树车辆段工会从一九四九年起就盗卖车站上的物品；有人用公家的煤和水烧开水，然后卖给公家（在列车上贩卖）。这些情况，都引起了广大职工的不满。我们建议中国铁路工会东北地区委员会，对这些问题作严肃的认真的处理，绥化、佳木斯两分区委员会领导方面要作公开的深刻的检讨。  韩镪  刘学正
