    Self-Criticism Regarding Xing Weiqin's Embezzlement
    Comrade Editor: The criticism of our work by Comrade Bai Shuitian, published in the People's Daily on January 21st, is entirely factual and of great help to our committee. The major embezzler Xing Weiqin is a bourgeois element who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. He lived a decadent life in the past, but we did not pay attention or remain vigilant. We blindly trusted him, assigned him to work in the production department, allowed him to be responsible for the custody of funds amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan, and gave him both the official seal and the department head's private seal to manage. We also asked him to handle the work of urging the repayment of loans. Starting from March of last year, Xing embezzled over 260 million yuan of loan repayments from six loan recipients, including the Fur and Leather Cooperative. After the launch of the anti-corruption campaign, we uncovered his embezzlement. Faced with irrefutable evidence, Xing admitted to the embezzlement, but stubbornly refused to disclose the whereabouts of the embezzled funds. We have already asked the Municipal People's Court to punish him according to the law.

    In order to achieve his embezzlement goals, Xing treated everyone to meals, cigarettes, and even lent money. We did not pay attention to correcting these illegal behaviors, mistakenly believing that his extravagance in spending, eating, and dressing was due to his class origin, and even wrongly thought, "It's impossible to demand too much of him." During the rectification and cadre review movement last year, Xing confessed to some personal lifestyle problems, and we mistakenly thought he had made progress. This fully demonstrates our error, which is not just bureaucratic but, more seriously, a complete loss of vigilance in the face of the bourgeoisie's attack on us.

    Our committee's "Self-Salvation Straw Bag Factory" has suffered a loss of over 100 million yuan. The reasons for this, in addition to waste, are mainly due to embezzlement by corrupt elements. We are now specifically organizing a group of cadres to conduct a thorough investigation.

### 天津市失业工人救济委员会  关于邢维钦贪污的检讨

    关于邢维钦贪污的检讨
    编辑同志：一月二十一日人民日报刊载了白水天同志对我会工作的批评，内容完全属实，对我会的帮助很大。大贪污犯邢维钦是混进革命队伍的资产阶级分子。他过去生活糜烂，但我们没有注意和警惕。我们盲目地信任他，分配他到生产处去工作，让他负责保管十数亿元的资金，把处理的公章和处长的私章都交给他管，又叫他办理催还贷款的工作。邢犯自去年三月起，就陆续窃取了皮毛合作社等六个贷款户所交还的贷款共二亿六千多万元。在反贪污运动开始后，我们查出了他的贪污事实。邢犯迫于证据确凿，承认了贪污行为，但对贪污款的下落则坚不吐实。我们已请市人民法院依法惩办他。
    邢犯为了达到贪污的目的，请大家吃饭、抽烟，还借钱给大家。我们没有注意纠正他这些非法行为，误认为他花钱多，吃穿浮华，是阶级出身的缘故，甚至错误地认为：“不可能对他要求过高。”邢犯在去年整风审干运动中，交代了一些生活方面的问题，我们便误认为他有进步。这充分说明了我们的错误，不只是官僚主义，更严重的是在资产阶级向我们进攻的面前，根本失掉了警惕性。
    我会经营的“自救草袋厂”亏损一亿多元。其原因，除了浪费外，主要的是被贪污分子贪污了。现在我们正专门组织一批干部进行彻查。
