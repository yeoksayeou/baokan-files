    Tianjin’s Guangdexing Cotton Mill Manager, Cotton Joint Purchase Committee Deputy Director Sun Bowen, and fifteen other cotton mill unscrupulous merchants, systematically and with planning, defrauded the people of their assets by substituting inferior cotton for good and skimping on materials when the China People's Relief Association purchased over 700,000 catties of cotton to make padded clothing for Korean refugees. Preliminary statistics show that Guangdexing, Yijucheng, Yongtaixing, Shenchangyuan, Ruihuaxing, Yongju, and other six cotton mill unscrupulous merchants alone defrauded over one billion yuan.

    Last October, unscrupulous merchant Sun Bowen learned that the China People's Relief Association had entrusted the Tianjin Branch to make padded clothing for Korean refugees and was purchasing large quantities of cotton. He then used the name of the "joint operation" of Guangdexing, Yijucheng, Yongtaixing, and other six companies to contact the Tianjin Flower, Yarn, and Cloth Company to sell cotton. They first used deception to sign a contract with the Tianjin Branch of the China People's Relief Association. Normally, a contract should specify the specifications of the goods and the composition of the raw materials. However, this contract completely lacked these specifications. At that time, samples were attached to the contract as the basis for production and delivery, but after the manufacturers obtained the samples, Sun Bowen actually notified them, saying: "Do not hand over the samples to the receiving department during delivery, so that there will be no standard during acceptance." In this way, the unscrupulous merchants were able to openly deliver inferior goods.

    The unscrupulous merchants not only used the worst waste cotton and cotton that had been blackened by fire, but even used the dregs (mostly soil) that were sifted out when ginning waste cotton. They sprinkled more than 10% water and a large amount of melon fluff and raw leather into the worst waste cotton. They also cut corners during ginning. According to Guangdexing workers, Sun Bowen only allowed the cotton to be ginned once, even though it should have been ginned twice. According to calculations by Guangdexing employees, unscrupulous merchant Sun Bowen cheated approximately 2,500 yuan per catty of cotton sold to the Tianjin Branch of the China People's Relief Association.

    In order to carry out these criminal activities, the unscrupulous merchants also deceived the employees of their factories. When Guangdexing workers heard that the cotton they were ginning was for making padded clothes for Korean refugees, they repeatedly suggested to the unscrupulous merchants to use better cotton. Unscrupulous merchant Sun Bowen said, "This is 'good' enough." He also hid the contract, fearing that the employees would know that he was substituting inferior cotton for good. The cotton delivered by the unscrupulous merchants was so bad that it could not be worse. Many cotton fibers were like ash, flying away at the slightest touch and unable to form wadding. The unscrupulous merchants also fumigated many poor-quality waste cotton fibers or cotton fibers that had been burned with a large amount of sulfur, which smelled very pungent. When these cotton fibers were sent to the citizens to make clothes, many people felt dizzy from the smell of sulfur and the stench of waste cotton. They wondered why such bad cotton was being used to make padded clothes, and some people even replaced it with their own good cotton. They did not know that this was the work of unscrupulous merchants who were harming both heaven and earth.

    The money to buy the cotton was donated by the people of the motherland, who were demonstrating a high degree of internationalism and patriotism in order to enthusiastically support the Korean people. When the people donated, they fervently hoped to help their Korean brothers. However, the unscrupulous merchants, driven by madness, stole from these funds and undermined the profound friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, acting as accomplices of the American aggressors! According to preliminary calculations by the Tianjin Municipal Thrift and Inspection Committee, the six unscrupulous merchants stole more than one billion yuan in assets from a transaction volume of forty billion yuan. The amount of theft by the remaining ten companies is still under thorough investigation. The unscrupulous merchants' criminal behavior was reported last winter by citizens making padded clothes and patriotic small cotton merchants. When the Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate conducted an investigation, these unscrupulous merchants not only showed no remorse, but Sun Bowen also convened a meeting of various manufacturers to make false allocation lists and false cost lists to deceive the government. After the anti-bribery movement was launched, the Tianjin Municipal Thrift and Inspection Committee had investigated the crimes of the unscrupulous merchants, but the criminals Sun Bowen, Hou Yutang, Han Pinqing, and others still tried to deny their crimes, refused to confess, and resisted with despicable means. Based on the above circumstances, the Tianjin Municipal People's Court has arrested the principal culprits Sun Bowen, Yongtaixing Manager Hou Yutang, and Yijucheng Manager Han Pinqing, and will severely punish them according to law.

    天津市广德兴等十六家棉厂奸商
    有计划地集体盗窃救济朝鲜难民的棉花
    主犯孙博文、侯玉棠、韩聘卿已被逮捕法办
    天津市广德兴棉厂经理、棉花联购委员会副主任委员孙博文等十六家棉厂奸商，在中国人民救济总会收购为朝鲜难民做棉衣的七十多万斤棉花时，有组织有计划地以坏顶好，偷工减料，大量诈骗人民资财。仅广德兴、义聚成、永太兴、慎昌源、瑞华兴、永聚等六家棉厂奸商从中诈骗的资财初步统计就超过十亿元。
    去年十月奸商孙博文打听到中国人民救济总会委托天津分会给朝鲜难民做棉衣，大量收购棉花时，即用广德兴、义聚成、永太兴等六家“联营”名义，通过天津市花纱布公司前往洽售。他们首先用蒙蔽手段和中国人民救济总会天津分会签订了合同。本来一般合同，都应规定货物的规格、原料的成分。但是这个合同完全没有这些规定。当时随合同附有货样，作为生产和交货的依据，但当各厂商取得货样后，孙博文竟通知他们说：“交货时候不要把货样交给收货处，使验收时没有标准。”奸商们就这样得以公然地送交坏货。
    奸商们不但使用最坏的废棉和被火烧得变黑的棉花，连弹废棉时弹下的渣滓（多半是土）都用上了。他们在最坏的废棉里洒上百分之十几的水和大量的瓜绒、生皮等。弹的时候还偷工，据广德兴工人检举：应弹两遍的，孙博文只让弹一遍。奸商孙博文卖给中国人民救济总会天津分会的棉花，据广德兴职工的计算，每斤约欺诈二千五百多元。
    奸商们为进行这些罪恶活动，还对本厂职工进行欺骗。广德兴工人在弹制中听说是为朝鲜难民做棉衣的棉花，曾多次向奸商提议换好一些的，奸商孙博文说：“这样已经够‘好’了。”并且把合同藏起来，怕职工知道他以坏顶好。奸商们送交的棉花，坏到了不能再坏的程度，许多棉花就像灰一样，一动就飞，不能成絮。许多成色很次的废棉，或被火烧过的棉花，奸商都用多量的硫磺薰过，气味非常难闻，当这些棉花送到市民手里去做衣服时，许多人被硫磺气味和废棉臭味薰得头昏，他们怀疑为什么拿这样坏的棉花做棉衣，有的人还把自己的好棉花换上去了，他们不知道这就是伤天害理的奸商们捣的鬼。
    买棉花的钱，是祖国人民发扬高度国际主义与爱国主义精神，为了热烈支援朝鲜人民而捐献的，这些钱是祖国人民的血汗。当人民捐献的时候，热切地希望能够对朝鲜弟兄有所帮助。但是丧心病狂的奸商竟从中盗窃、破坏中朝人民的深厚的友谊，做美国侵略者的帮凶！据天津市节约检查委员会的初步计算，六家奸商在四十亿元的交易额中，盗窃资财达十亿元以上，其余十家盗窃数字还在彻查中。奸商们的罪恶行为，去年冬天就被做棉衣的市民和有爱国心的小棉商们检举了。当天津市人民检察署进行调查时，这些奸商不但毫无悔过之意，孙犯博文并召集各厂商开会，制做假配料单和假成本单欺骗政府。反行贿运动展开以后，天津市节约检查委员会已将奸商罪行调查清楚，但奸商孙博文、侯玉棠、韩聘卿等犯仍图抵赖，拒不坦白，并用卑鄙手段抵抗。根据以上种种情况，天津市人民法院已将主犯孙博文、永太兴经理侯玉棠、义聚成经理韩聘卿逮捕，依法严惩。    （天津日报）
