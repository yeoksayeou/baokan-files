    Learning the Internationalist Spirit of Soviet Experts
    Liu Dezhen, Model Worker of Shijingshan Power Plant

    I am the leader of the repair team at the air field of the Shijingshan Power Plant. I first met Soviet experts at the end of 1949. Before I met Soviet experts, although I had some understanding of the Soviet Union, I didn't quite believe that foreigners would treat our workers well. Because I had seen some foreign engineers who disliked workers being dirty, holding their noses with handkerchiefs as they walked past workers. One day, just as I was wiping a machine, a Soviet expert came, and he shook hands and greeted all the workers. I was worried, looking at my oily hands, but unexpectedly the Soviet expert extended a friendly hand to me. Then he took off his coat and personally went to work on the machine. This incident quickly changed my view of Soviet experts.

    The more I came into contact with Soviet experts, the more I felt their sincere help and deep friendship towards our country's economic construction. They actively saved wealth for our country as if they loved their own motherland. At first, some of my colleagues in the factory thought that the factory's machines were old and prone to accidents, and that it would be difficult to guarantee the capital's electricity supply without adding equipment. After carefully inspecting the plant's equipment and machine performance, Soviet experts proposed that if the original equipment was fully utilized and the machines' potential was exploited, not only could the capital's electricity supply be guaranteed, but there would be no need to add equipment for two years. Soviet experts provided 209 extremely important suggestions for improving work in all production links, from large to small, within six months. For example, in order to improve boiler efficiency and extend boiler life, they proposed a method for treating water hardness; in order to reduce costs, they advocated the large-scale use of extraction steam (waste steam); in order to ensure safe power generation, they proposed adding wire mesh around the transformers. In implementing the Soviet experts' suggestions, the use of extraction steam alone has saved the country 2,700 tons of coal. Before liberation, it took half a month to install a turbine to find the center. After the Soviet experts' careful design and help in improving the workers' skills, it now only takes a day and a half. Soviet experts cherish our machines as if they were their own eyes. Once, when a crane was hoisting a turbine blade of a certain machine, the steel wire was tied incorrectly. When a Soviet expert saw it, he immediately stopped the crane. He said, "If there is a danger with the crane, how much loss will it cause to the people!" Once I put a "dial indicator" next to the machine, I was strictly criticized by the Soviet expert. He said, "How can you put such valuable parts carelessly and not put them in a safe place?" Some people often put iron crowbars and other tools on the machine surface after using them. Soviet experts criticized this practice and patiently explained to us: "The machine surface is extremely precise. Putting things on it casually will damage the machine surface, even if your eyes cannot see it. If you take care of the machine carefully and meticulously, you can extend the life of the machine and save national wealth."

    I once wondered: What are the Soviet experts working so hard for? I finally got the answer. Once, when I was jointly repairing a generator with a Soviet expert, in order to generate electricity as soon as possible, the Soviet expert worked overtime. He entered the air field at 8:00 in the morning and did not leave work until dawn the next day. He even ate in the machine room. I advised him to go back and rest. He said, "Comrade Stalin told us: We must help the Chinese people build well. This is the capital's power plant, where Chairman Mao is. I don't feel tired, I feel honored." He spoke so kindly and naturally, I shook his hand tightly and was so moved that I didn't know what to say—here I specifically saw what "internationalism" is!

    This spirit of internationalism gave the factory workers great strength. The workers said: "The Soviet elder brother is helping us so sincerely, shouldn't we work even harder to produce for the motherland?" For more than two years, thanks to the help of Soviet experts and the active production of all the workers, the power plant has shown a new look in production: coal consumption has been reduced, power generation load has been increased, and accidents have been greatly reduced. In the early days of liberation in 1949, there were 113 major accidents in the factory. In 1950, it was reduced to 38 times. In 1951, there were only five major accidents throughout the year.

    学习苏联专家的国际主义精神
    石景山发电厂劳动模范  刘德珍
    我是石景山发电厂气机场的修理组组长。我第一次见到苏联专家是在一九四九年年底。在我没见到苏联专家以前，虽然对苏联有些认识，但不大相信外国人会对我们工人很好。因为我曾见过一些外国工程师嫌工人脏，用手绢捏着鼻子从工人身边走过。有一天，正当我擦机器的时候，苏联专家来了，他和所有工人都握手问好。我看着自己的两手油泥着急，没想到苏联专家已向我伸出友谊的手，随后他脱掉大衣，亲自上机器去工作了。这件事很快使我改变了我对苏联专家的看法。
    和苏联专家接触越多，我便越加感到他们对我国经济建设的真诚帮助和深厚的友谊。他们像热爱自己的祖国一样地积极为我们的国家节约财富。开始我厂曾有一些工友认为厂里机器破旧，出事故多，不增添设备，很难保证首都的用电。苏联专家仔细考察了全厂的设备和机器性能后，提出如果充分利用原有设备，发挥机器潜在能力，不仅可保证首都的用电，而且两年内不必添置设备。苏联专家从各个生产环节，从大到小，在半年内提供了二百零九条极关重要的改进工作的意见。例如：为了提高锅炉的效率和延长锅炉寿命，提出水硬度的处理方法；为了降低成本，提倡大量利用抽汽（废汽）；为了安全发电，提出在变压器周围加设铁丝网。在实施苏联专家的建议中，仅利用抽汽一项，已给国家节省了二千七百吨煤。解放前安装汽轮机找中心的工作，需花费半月的时间，经过苏联专家的认真设计和帮助工友改进技术，现在只用一天半时间便可搞好。苏联专家像爱护自己眼睛一样地爱护我们的机器。有次起重机吊某号机汽叶时，钢丝拴得不对，被苏联专家看到了，他立刻让起重机停下来，他说，“如果起重机出了危险，会给人民造成多大损失啊！”我有次把“转表”放在机器旁边了，便受了苏联专家的严格批评，他说：“这样珍贵的机件，你怎么能随便乱放，而不放在安全的地方呢？”有人用完铁搬子之类的工具，常顺手往机器平面上一放。苏联专家批评这种做法，并耐心地给我们解释：“机器平面是万分精确的，随便便放东西，便损伤了机器平面，虽然你的眼睛还看不出来。如果经常地细心地爱护机器，便能够延长机器寿命，节约国家财富。”
    我曾这样想过：苏联专家这样认真工作，是为的什么呢？我终于得到了回答。在一次和苏联专家共同抢修某号发电机时，为争取早日发电，苏联专家加班工作，他从上午八点进气机场，一直到次日拂晓才下班。甚至连吃饭都是在机器房吃。我劝他回去休息，他说：“斯大林同志告诉我们：要好好帮助中国人民建设。这里是首都发电厂，是毛主席在的地方，我没有感到疲劳，我感到光荣。”他讲得那样亲切自然，我紧握着他的手，感动得不知说什么好——在这里我具体看到什么是“国际主义”啊！
    这种国际主义的精神给全厂工友很大的力量。工友们说：“苏联老大哥这样真诚帮助我们，我们不更应该加倍努力为祖国生产吗？”两年多来，发电厂由于苏联专家的帮助，由于全体工友积极生产，出现了崭新的生产面貌：煤耗降低，发电负荷增高，事故大大减少了。解放初期的一九四九年，厂里发生重大事故一百一十三次，一九五○年减少到三十八次，一九五一年全年发生重大事故只有五次了。
