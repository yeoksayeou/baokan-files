Demanding Strict Prohibition of Retaliatory Actions by Unlawful Merchants
Xi'an Handicraft Workers, Shop Assistants, and Apprentices Hold Meeting
Xi'an Municipal People's Government Accepts Demands and Announces Implementation

A number of unrepentant illegal industrialists and businessmen in Xi'an refused to confess, suppressed shop assistants' exposure and denunciation, and unscrupulously attacked workers, shop assistants, and apprentices by means of dismissal, increased working hours, reduced wages, and closing down businesses to cause unemployment, arousing the unparalleled anger of all workers, shop assistants, and apprentices in the city. On the morning of January 17, representatives of handicraft workers, shop assistants, and apprentices from all over the city held an emergency meeting, resolving to more actively expose the illegal activities of unlawful industrialists and businessmen, and further promote the movement against bribery, tax evasion, and fraud. All representatives also wrote to Xi'an Mayor Fang Zhongru and Deputy Mayors Zhang Fengbo and Chen Shiyu, requesting the People's Government to promptly stop the various oppression and retaliatory acts of unlawful industrialists and businessmen against workers, shop assistants, and apprentices; all representatives resolutely guaranteed to victoriously and thoroughly complete the glorious task of the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, and fraud.

After the meeting, all representatives immediately sent four representatives to the Municipal People's Government with the letter. After receiving the letter, Mayor Fang Zhongru and Deputy Mayors Zhang Fengbo and Chen Shiyu immediately represented the Municipal People's Government in fully adopting the demands of the workers, shop assistants, and apprentices' representatives meeting and announced their implementation. They also sent separate replies to all representatives of handicraft workers, shop assistants, and apprentices and the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce. All workers, shop assistants, and apprentices in the city were extremely excited upon hearing this news.

The Xi'an Handicraft Workers, Shop Assistants, and Apprentices Representatives Meeting put forward the following four suggestions in a letter to Mayor Fang Zhongru, Deputy Mayors Zhang Fengbo, and Chen Shiyu, requesting the government to examine them and promulgate them:

    I. During the movement against bribery and tax evasion, a few illegal industrialists and businessmen have dismissed workers, shop assistants, and apprentices under various pretexts. Please stop this.

   II. Some illegal industrialists and businessmen arbitrarily increase working hours, obstruct workers, shop assistants, and apprentices from attending meetings or making denunciations. Please stop this.

  III. Some illegal industrialists and businessmen beat, scold, and abuse workers, shop assistants, and apprentices, arbitrarily reduce wages, do not allow apprentices to eat their fill, or give them raw steamed buns and raw vegetables to eat, and oppress and retaliate against those who expose and denounce them. Please stop this.

   IV. Some illegal industrialists and businessmen not only refuse to confess and repent but also close their businesses without government approval to evade the movement, threatening workers, shop assistants, and apprentices with unemployment. Please stop this.

The letter firmly stated: Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the People's Government, and our superior trade unions, we will certainly be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties, persuade and supervise illegal industrialists and businessmen to confess their guilt to the government. If they refuse to confess, we will certainly be more courageous in exposing and denouncing them, and victoriously and thoroughly complete the glorious task of opposing bribery, profiteering, tax evasion, and false accounting.

Mayor Fang and others said in their reply: We fully adopt the four suggestions you have made on behalf of the Municipal People's Government and will announce their implementation. In this movement, you have responded to Chairman Mao's call, enthusiastically and actively persuading and exposing the illegal activities of unrepentant illegal industrialists and businessmen. This is a manifestation of loving the people's motherland and safeguarding the laws and disciplines of the new China, and it is carrying out a major political struggle. The people of the city and the Municipal People's Government will support you.

    西安市若干坚不悔改的不法工商业者拒不坦白，压制店员揭发检举，以解雇、增加工时、降低工资、关门歇业使工人店员失业等无耻办法来向工人、店员、学徒施行猖狂进攻，引起全市工人、店员、学徒的无比愤怒。一月十七日上午全市手工业工人、店员、学徒代表举行了紧急会议，决议更加积极揭发不法工商业者的非法行为，更进一步地推动反行贿、反偷漏、反欺诈运动。全体代表并向西安市方仲如市长、张锋伯、陈式玉副市长写信，请求人民政府迅速制止不法工商业者对工人、店员、学徒的种种压迫和报复行为；全体代表并坚决保证胜利地彻底地完成反行贿、反偷漏、反欺诈斗争的光荣任务。
    会议结束后，全体代表即推派四位代表，持信赴市人民政府。方仲如市长和张锋伯、陈式玉副市长收到信后，立即代表市人民政府完全采纳工人、店员、学徒代表会议的要求，并宣布实行。他们并分别给全市手工业工人、店员、学徒全体代表和市工商业联合会复信。全市工人、店员、学徒，听到这个消息后，异常振奋。
    全市手工业工人、店员、学徒代表会议给方仲如市长、张锋伯、陈式玉副市长的信中提出以下四点建议请政府加以审查，并明令公布：
    一、在反行贿、反偷漏税运动期间，有少数违法工商业者借故解雇工人、店员、学徒，请予制止。
    二、有的违法工商业者，任意增加工时，阻挠工人、店员、学徒开会或检举，请予制止。
    三、有的违法工商业者，对工人、店员、学徒实行打骂虐待，任意降低工资，不让学徒吃饱或给吃生馍、吃生菜，对揭发和检举者施以压迫和报复，请予制止。
    四、有的违法工商业者，不但不肯坦白悔过，反而不经政府批准擅自关门歇业，逃避运动，以失业来威胁工人、店员、学徒，请予制止。
    信中坚决表示：在共产党、人民政府和我们上级工会的领导下，我们一定能够战胜各种困难，规劝和监督违法工商业者向政府坦白悔过，如果他们坚不坦白，我们一定会更勇敢地进行揭发和检举，胜利地彻底地完成反行贿、反暴利、反偷税、反假账的光荣任务。
    方市长等的复信中说：你们所提的四项建议，我们代表市人民政府完全采纳，并要宣布实行。你们响应毛主席号召，在这次运动中，热情积极，向不知悔改的不法工商业主进行规劝和揭发他们的违法事件，这是热爱人民祖国、维护新中国法纪的表现，是在进行重大的政治斗争。全市人民和市人民政府都会支持你们的。
