    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is Following the Path Taken by the Soviet Army
    Jiang Xuelsan, Commander of the Tashan Hero Regiment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    Recalling the winter of 1942, the Japanese invaders launched a large-scale "mopping-up" operation, known as the "torch blockade, iron arm encirclement," against the Jiaodong area of Shandong, resulting in the Mashishan massacre, in which nearly a thousand soldiers and civilians were martyred. But the Chinese people will never yield. At that time, our regiment charged back and forth, leading more than 1,800 people out of the enemy's encirclement. Comrade Chen Ziying, the former chief of staff of our regiment and a member of the Communist Party, was unfortunately wounded and captured. His heroic and unyielding behavior in the face of the enemy is something we will never forget. When the enemy asked him, "Are you an officer of the Eighth Route Army?" he sternly said:
    "I am not only a commander of the Eighth Route Army, but also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. What can you do to me!" After saying that, he picked up a wooden stick on the spot and struck the enemy who was asking the question. His heroic sacrifice gave our troops new strength. After more than a month of hard fighting between the army and the people, we finally crushed the enemy's heinous "mopping-up" operation.
    We went through eight years of arduous War of Resistance Against Japan, and finally won victory. However, American imperialism, determined to be the enemy of the Chinese people, directly directed and aided the Kuomintang reactionaries to launch a large-scale offensive against the Chinese people after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, attempting to seize the fruits of the Chinese people's victory through its running dog Chiang Kai-shek and replace the Japanese fascists' past position in Asia. But this American imperialist dream was shattered. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the Chinese people fought bravely. In the four-year War of Liberation, they wiped out more than 8 million Kuomintang bandit troops personally equipped by American imperialism, and won a nationwide victory. In the autumn of 1948, during the campaign to liberate Jinzhou, our Tashan Hero Regiment responded to the Party's call. In order to cut off the enemy's retreat and ensure the complete annihilation of the enemy defending Jinzhou and other isolated strongholds, the troops turned to the enemy's rear, cut off the main artery connecting the Kuomintang bandit army inside and outside Shanhaiguan – the Beining Railway – and quickly seized Tashan (a small station between Jinxi and Gaoqiaozhen, five or six miles from the sea). After six days and nights of bloody battle, we repelled the joint offensive of the Kuomintang bandit army's naval, land, and air forces, and blocked like a copper wall the five, seven, and eventually twelve divisions that American imperialism had shipped by warship to reinforce Jinzhou for Chiang Kai-shek. This ensured that our troops completely annihilated the 120,000 enemy troops defending Jinzhou, captured the enemy's corps commander Fan Hanjie alive, and quickly completely liberated the Northeast, entered Shanhaiguan and went south, and cooperated with fraternal troops across the country to liberate all of China.
    On the occasion of celebrating the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, I recalled the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation in which I directly participated, and it made me deeply feel that our Chinese People's Liberation Army is precisely following the path taken by the Soviet Army. We know that when German fascism, with all its strength and the power of its European vassals, perfidiously invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, the Soviet army, under the leadership of the great and talented commander Stalin, after four years of bloody fighting, finally completely annihilated the most elite Nazi army and its vassal armies in the capitalist world, a total of 10 million men, recovered all the occupied territories, and liberated the people of Southeast European countries ravaged by the Hitler bandits. After crushing the military might of fascist Germany, the Soviet army turned its guns eastward and annihilated the elite of Japanese imperialism – the Kwantung Army – in one fell swoop, liberated Northeast China, forced the Japanese invaders to surrender, and ended World War II. The heroic actions of the Soviet army in the battles to defend Moscow and Stalingrad left a deep impression on us. I once participated in the grand celebrations of the October Revolution Day in the Soviet Union last year, visited the grand rally and military parade held in Moscow, and witnessed the powerful armed forces of the Soviet Union with my own eyes. At that time, countless guests on the reviewing stand enthusiastically cheered the Soviet soldiers who were vigilantly guarding the peace and security of the Soviet Socialist country. I also visited the Soviet Red Army Museum, which displayed many historical relics of the Soviet Red Army martyrs. For example, during the Soviet-German War, the command post and the front-line telecommunications were suddenly interrupted once. A signal soldier braved the artillery fire and crawled to check the wires. When he reached the place where the wires were broken by the artillery fire, his hands were already injured and unable to move. However, the task of connecting the wires was very urgent. He tried his best to hold the two wire ends in his mouth and bit them together, successfully completing the task of connecting the wires and sacrificing himself by electric shock. In order to commemorate this martyr, the wire he used at that time is still preserved in the museum. Also, during the Soviet-German War, a regiment defended a position near Moscow and fought very bravely. The secretary of the regiment's party committee called on everyone: "Moscow is behind us, we cannot retreat!" In order to protect the military flag, he finally hid the military flag inside his close-fitting shirt and died heroically. When his body was exhumed in 1949 for relocation, this blood-stained military flag was discovered and is now preserved in the museum as a permanent memorial. These historical relics moved and admired me very much.
    I deeply realize that our Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Soviet Army are linked in a common cause by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This cause is to prevent the re-aggression of Japanese aggressors and their collaborators and to defend world peace. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, which defeated Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit army supported by American imperialism, and the Soviet Army, which defeated German and Japanese fascists, stand firmly on the same front to defend peace. This is an absolutely invincible force. In celebrating the Soviet Army Day, we must earnestly study the rich experience of the Soviet Army to strengthen our country's military strength and jointly defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    中国人民解放军正是走着苏联军队所走的道路
    中国人民解放军塔山英雄团团长  江雪三
    回忆一九四二年的冬天，日寇以数万之众对山东的胶东地区，实行了所谓“火把封锁，铁臂合围”的大“扫荡”，造成马石山惨案，殉难军民近一千人。但中国人民是永远不会屈服的。当时我团往返冲杀，连续带领一千八百多名群众，从敌人的合击圈内冲了出来。我团前参谋长，共产党员陈子英同志，不幸负伤被俘。他在敌人面前那种英勇不屈的英雄行为，是我们所永远不会忘记的。当敌人问他：“你是八路军的军官吗？”他声色俱厉地说：
    “我不光是八路军的一个指挥员，还是中国共产党的党员，你们能把我怎样！”说完就地拾起一条木棍，朝着问话的敌人劈头打了下去。他慷慨就义的故事，给了我们的部队以新的力量。在军民奋战之下，经过一个多月的时间，终于粉碎了敌人这次罪恶的“扫荡”。
    我们经过八年艰苦的抗日战争，好容易取得了胜利，而决心与中国人民为敌的美帝国主义，在中国抗日战争胜利之后，直接指使与援助国民党反动派向中国人民大举进攻，妄图通过它的走狗蒋介石来夺取中国人民的胜利果实，并代替日本法西斯过去在亚洲的地位。但是美帝国主义的这个美梦破灭了。中国人民在毛主席和共产党领导之下英勇战斗，在四年解放战争中消灭了由美帝国主义亲手装备的国民党匪帮军队八百多万人，取得了全国性的胜利。我们塔山英雄团，在一九四八年秋天解放锦州战役中，响应了党的号召，为了切断敌人退路，保证全歼锦州和其他几个孤立据点的守敌，部队转到敌后，斩断了当时国民党匪军在关内外联系的大动脉——北宁路，迅速抢占了塔山（锦西、高桥镇之间，离海五、六里的一个小车站），血战六昼夜，击退了国民党匪军海陆空军的联合进攻，铜墙铁壁似地堵住了由美帝国主义替蒋介石用兵船运来增援锦州的五个师、七个师，以至最后运到的十二个师的兵力，保证部队全歼锦州十二万守敌，活捉了敌人的兵团司令范汉杰；由此迅速全部解放东北，进关南下，配合全国兄弟部队解放全中国。
    值此庆祝苏联建军三十四周年之际，我回忆了过去我所直接参加的抗日战争和解放战争，使我深深地感到：我们中国人民解放军，正是走着苏联军队所走的道路。我们知道，当一九四一年德国法西斯挟其全力及其欧洲附庸国的力量背信弃义向苏联侵犯时，苏军在伟大的天才统帅斯大林的领导下，经过了四年的血战，终于彻底消灭了资本主义世界中最精锐的纳粹军队及其附庸军一千万人，收复了全部被侵占的国土，并解放了在希特勒匪徒蹂躏下的东南欧各国人民。在粉碎了法西斯德国的军事力量后，苏联军队又挥戈东向，一举歼灭了日本帝国主义的精锐——关东军，解放了我国的东北，迫使日寇投降，结束了第二次世界大战。苏联军队在保卫莫斯科和斯大林格勒等战役的英雄行为，给我们的印象十分深刻。我曾经在苏联参加了去年十月革命节的庆祝盛典，参观了在莫斯科举行的盛大集会和阅兵典礼，亲眼见到了苏联强大的武装力量。当时检阅台上无数的来宾都热烈地向警觉地保卫着苏维埃社会主义国家的和平与安全的苏军战士欢呼。我又去参观了苏联红军博物馆，里面陈设了很多苏联红军烈士的史迹。如苏德战争中，某次指挥部和前线电讯突然中断，一个电讯兵冒着炮火爬行着去检查电线，到了电线被炮火轰断的地方，他的两手已经受伤不能动作了，可是，接线任务非常紧急，他努力用嘴把两根线头衔起，咬在一块，胜利地完成接线任务后而中电牺牲。为了纪念这位烈士，他当时所用的电线仍保存在博物馆里。还有在苏德战争中有一个团队坚守莫斯科附近的一个阵地，打的非常英勇，该团党的书记号召大家：“后面就是莫斯科，不能退却！”他为了保护军旗，最后把军旗藏在贴身的衬衫里面，壮烈牺牲。到一九四九年移灵，发掘出他的尸体，才发现了这面血染的军旗，现今保存在博物馆里，作为永久的纪念。这些史迹，都使我十分感动与钦佩。
    我深深地认识到我们中国人民解放军和苏联军队，是被中苏友好同盟互助条约联结在共同的事业中的。这个事业就是防止日本侵略者及其合作者的重新侵略与保卫世界和平。战胜了日本帝国主义以及美帝国主义所支持的国民党匪军的中国人民解放军，和打败了德、日法西斯的苏联军队坚固地站在一条战线上保卫着和平。这是一支绝对不可战胜的力量。在庆祝苏联建军节时，我们要认真地学习苏联军队的丰富经验来加强我国的军事力量，来共同保卫远东和世界的和平。
