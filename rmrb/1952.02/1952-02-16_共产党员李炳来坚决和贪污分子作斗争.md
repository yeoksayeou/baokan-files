Communist Party Member Li Binglai Resolutely Fights Against Corrupt Elements
    Wang Shou Rong
    Communist Party member Li Binglai is an accountant at the state-owned Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory, and is 29 years old this year. Since joining the Party in 1941, he has always maintained a spirit of hard work and simplicity in his financial work for more than ten years. He distinguishes between public and private matters, keeps clear procedures, and does not take advantage of the public in any small way. Especially after entering the city, he is always vigilant against the bourgeoisie's attacks, constantly fights against corrupt elements, resolutely implements the financial system, and safeguards national interests.

    In 1949, Li Binglai was transferred to work in the newly established staff and workers cooperative of the enterprise company. This cooperative only had two rooms, with neither a kitchen nor a dormitory. Some comrades who had worked with Li Binglai before saw his small office and said that the place was too small and too difficult. But Li Binglai happily carried out the preparatory work for the cooperative. At that time, the comrades of the enterprise company asked him to buy new desks and chairs. Li Binglai said, "There are many old desks and chairs in the company. Wouldn't it be good to repair them for use?" Li Binglai established the staff and workers cooperative in the spirit of thrift. Later, the cooperative's business gradually developed, and the cooperative director Chen Dezheng introduced a man named Wang Dengyou. This man brought with him the bad habits of the bourgeoisie's decadence and corruption, and as soon as he entered the revolutionary ranks, he wanted to grab something. To make it easier to grab, he first wanted to use methods such as inviting people to dinner and the theater to drag Li Binglai, who was of good character, into the water. But Li Binglai was very vigilant and had already seen through his tricks. He constantly investigated and understood Wang Dengyou's bad behavior, and finally discovered that Wang Dengyou was a guy who was doing his own business under the guise of revolution. In order to educate Wang Dengyou, Li Binglai, based on solid evidence, made a severe criticism of Wang Dengyou. However, Wang Dengyou did not show any repentance. Once, Wang Dengyou was sent to Datong to promote cigarettes. Li Binglai was very worried about him. Taking the opportunity to go home (Wutai, Shanxi), he got off the train in Datong to check Wang Dengyou's work. When Wang Dengyou saw Li Binglai, he said with a grin, "It's not convenient for us to eat, drink, and have fun in the office. Now that we're in Datong, we should have a good time for a few days!" Li Binglai solemnly said to him at the time, "Revolutionary cadres cannot eat, drink, and have fun anywhere. They can only serve the people wholeheartedly!" After Wang Dengyou's two attacks on Li Binglai failed, he did not give up. He prepared a sum of money and, when Li Binglai was getting on the train to go home, stuffed it into Li Binglai's pocket. Li Binglai immediately pushed it back and suggested that the cooperative leadership expel this shameless Wang Dengyou. The cooperative leadership accepted this suggestion and expelled this guy.

    In January 1950, Li Binglai was transferred to the Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory to work as a cashier. Not long after arriving at his post, the accounting section chief, Wang Jingxuan (a retained employee) a corrupt element, wanted to use public funds. Li Binglai said at the time, "It is illegal to use public funds. Without the factory director's approval, not a penny can be used!" Wang Jingxuan felt that this was a bit of a loss of the section chief's "face," so he said angrily, "You're too rigid! You're still objecting to the section chief borrowing some money!" But Li Binglai was not intimidated by this "section chief," criticized Wang Jingxuan's erroneous behavior of undermining the financial system, and insisted on implementing the financial system. Later, Wang Jingxuan tried to use public funds several times, but was resolutely rejected by Li Binglai. Wang Jingxuan smiled on the surface but was angry in his heart, playing various tricks to despicably attack Li Binglai, but Li Binglai always grasped the principles. At his checkpoint, Wang Jingxuan did not get the opportunity to embezzle a single penny.

    After Li Binglai was in charge of cost accounting, Zhang Shuchun took over as cashier. When he handed over the procedures, he earnestly told Zhang Shuchun, "When you are in charge of the cashier's office, you must adhere to the accounting system and not allow anyone to use public funds casually." However, Zhang Shuchun could not adhere to the principles. Not long after becoming a cashier, Wang Jingxuan used public funds. After Li Binglai discovered this, he immediately gave his opinion to the leaders of the cigarette factory. The leaders then convened a meeting of all accounting personnel and severely criticized Wang Jingxuan and Zhang Shuchun on the spot. From then on, Zhang and Wang held grudges against Li Binglai, but Li Binglai did not let their evil intentions intimidate him, and he continued to persevere in the just struggle. This forced Zhang Shuchun to admit his mistakes in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. After Zhang Shuchun's self-criticism, Li Binglai patiently educated Zhang Shuchun, saying, "As long as you recognize your mistakes, correct your past mistakes, and fight against corrupt elements together, the people will still welcome you." Moved by Li Binglai's noble character, Zhang Shuchun not only admitted his mistakes, but later became an activist in the anti-corruption movement.

    Due to Li Binglai's persistent struggle and patient education, most of the personnel in the accounting section confessed their problems and stood in the ranks of the movement to launch a powerful struggle against corrupt elements.

　　共产党员李炳来坚决和贪污分子作斗争
    王守荣
    共产党员李炳来，是公营张垣纸烟厂的会计，今年二十九岁。他从一九四一年入党后，十几年来，在财经工作中，始终保持着艰苦朴素的作风。公私分明，手续清楚，不占公家一点小便宜。特别是进城以后，他随时警惕资产阶级的进攻，经常向贪污分子进行斗争，坚决执行财政制度，维护国家利益。
    一九四九年，李炳来被调到企业公司新成立的职工合作社工作。这个合作社，仅有两间房子，既没有厨房，又没有宿舍。一些从前和李炳来在一块工作的同志，见了他这个小机关就说房子太小了，太困难了。可是李炳来却愉快地进行合作社的筹备工作。当时，企业公司的同志让他买新桌子、新椅子。李炳来说：“公司里放着不少旧桌椅，修理一下用，不是很好吗？”李炳来就在节约的精神下把职工合作社建立起来了。后来，合作社业务逐渐有了发展，合作社主任陈德正便介绍来一个王登有，这人带着一身资产阶级的堕落、腐化的恶劣习气，一进革命阵营就想抓一把。他为了抓着方便，首先就想用请吃饭、看戏的办法，把品质优良的李炳来拖下水去。但李炳来的警惕性很高，早就看出他的鬼把戏了，他随时调查了解王登有的恶劣行为，终于发现了：王登有是一个挂着革命幌子，做着自己的买卖的家伙。为了教育王登有，李炳来根据真凭实据，向王登有提出了严厉的批评。可是王登有并没有丝毫悔改。有一次王登有被派到大同去推销纸烟，李炳来对他很不放心，趁回家（山西五台）的机会，在大同下车检查王登有的工作。王登有一见李炳来就嬉皮笑脸地说：“在机关里咱们吃喝玩乐不方便，这回到了大同，该好好玩几天吧！”李炳来当时十分严肃地向他说：“革命干部到任何地方也不能吃喝玩乐，只有忠心耿耿为人民服务！”王登有对李炳来两次进攻失败后，并没死心，他又准备了一笔钱，乘着李炳来回家上车时，就塞到李炳来的衣袋里，李炳来立即把他碰了回去，并建议合作社领导方面把这个无耻的王登有开除出去。合作社领导方面接受了这个意见，开除了这个家伙。
    一九五○年一月，李炳来被调到张垣纸烟厂作出纳工作。刚到工作岗位不几天，会计科长、贪污分子王静轩（留用人员），就要动用公款。李炳来当时说：“动用公款是不合法的，没有经过厂长批准，一分钱也不能动用！”王静轩觉得这有点丢科长的“脸”，就怒气冲冲地说：“你太死心眼啦，科长借点钱你还这样顶！”可是李炳来并没有被这位“科长”吓住，批驳了王静轩破坏财政制度的错误行为，坚持执行了财政制度。后来，王静轩曾几次想动用公款，都被李炳来坚决拒绝了。王静轩笑在面上，怒在心里，耍着各种花样卑鄙地打击李炳来，但是李炳来始终掌握原则，在他这个关口上，王静轩没有得到贪污一分钱的机会。
    李炳来管成本会计以后，出纳由张树春担任。当他交代手续时，很恳切地告诉张树春说：“你管出纳，无论如何要坚持会计制度，不能让任何人随便动用公款。”可是张树春不能坚持原则，当出纳不久，王静轩就动用了公款。李炳来发觉后，马上向纸烟厂领导同志提出意见，领导同志随即召开全体会计人员会议，当场严厉地批评了王静轩和张树春。从此以后，张、王二人对李炳来有了意见，但李炳来并没有让他们的邪气吓住，一直坚持正义的斗争。逼使张树春不得不在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中承认自己的错误。在张树春检讨以后，李炳来又很耐心地教育张树春说：“只要认识错误，痛改前非，共同向贪污分子作战，人民还是欢迎你的。”在李炳来高尚的品质感动下，张树春不仅承认错误，而且后来变成了反贪污运动中的积极分子。
    由于李炳来的坚持斗争并耐心教育，会计科的大部人员，都交代了自己的问题，站在运动的队伍里来，向贪污分子展开强有力的斗争。
