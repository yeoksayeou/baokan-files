    [Our Newspaper's Report] Following the capture of major embezzlers such as Xue Kunshan and Zhuang Zhifang, units under the Central People's Government Ministry of Trade have, in the past ten days, captured fourteen more major embezzlers in departments such as the Basic Construction Engineering Office and the China General Merchandise Company. Some of these major embezzlers are moths who collude with private merchants, accept bribes, allow private merchants to cut corners, help private merchants seek exorbitant profits, and steal state assets; others are treacherous merchants who have infiltrated state-owned economic organs and "spies" sent by treacherous merchants. These facts show that the bourgeoisie's attack on the revolutionary camp is all-pervasive.
    When the Basic Construction Engineering Office of the Central Ministry of Trade was building the Import Company Building in Brick Pagoda Hutong, Gao Shibin, director of the Beijing Direct Second Work Zone of the Engineering Office of the Ministry of Trade, and assistant engineer Min Naiguang, material clerk Chang Zhexin, etc., colluded with Chen Chengde, manager of the private Qilian Construction Factory, etc., to carry out collective embezzlement. According to Gao Shibin's confession, Chen Chengde promised to bribe 300 million yuan, and Gao allowed them to cut corners. According to preliminary statistics, this has caused the state basic construction fund to lose more than 1 billion yuan. Gao Shibin confessed that he had successively received 92 million yuan in bribes. At the beginning of the movement, he and his accomplices made a "defense alliance"; after January 20, he confessed his embezzlement and reported some of the embezzlement facts of his accomplices. The engineering office has now suspended him from his duties and ordered him to continue to confess. Min Naiguang colluded with private merchants, allowing private merchants to use inferior wood instead of good wood, increase labor costs, and cut corners, causing the state to lose at least 170 million yuan in assets. In addition, Chen Chengde also promised to give him 60 million yuan in bribes. Chang Zhexin colluded with contractors, wasted steel bars, and sold scrap steel bar ends at low prices, causing the state to lose more than 160 million yuan in assets. Chen Chengde had promised to give her 50 million yuan in bribes. Since the beginning of the movement, Min Naiguang and Chang Zhexin have resolutely opposed the people and refused to confess, and have been sent to court for punishment.
    Liu Yunshan, a clerk in the Import Section of the Business Department of the China General Merchandise Company, was responsible for purchasing imported goods. According to his confession, he accepted twelve bribes totaling 169.95 million yuan from ten private merchants in Tianjin in 73 transactions involving the purchase of bicycles, paper, etc. During the purchase, he colluded with private merchants, spoke for private merchants, and sought exorbitant profits for private merchants.
    Yu Xiaoxian, a member of the Import Section of the Business Department of the China General Merchandise Company, colluded with private merchants to increase purchase prices and embezzle from them. According to preliminary statistics, he caused the state to lose more than 300 million yuan in assets in transactions involving the purchase of bicycle chains, stationery paper, and paper. He has preliminarily confessed to accepting more than 73 million yuan in bribes from private merchants.
    Zhang Chengdian, chief of the Allocation Section of the China General Merchandise Company, opened Tongfeng Oil Factory in Tianjin, frequently traded on the black market in gold, silver dollars, etc., and leaked state secrets. He secretly ordered his younger brother to purchase alkali noodles in Hankou, and directed his relative Yu Boyan to engage in speculation and profiteering activities in Guangzhou, stealing state assets to enrich himself. He now owns more than 1 billion yuan in funds. He is a treacherous merchant who has infiltrated state-owned economic organs.
    Guo Zhonghui, a member of the Price Section of the China General Merchandise Company, frequently sold economic intelligence, and sold intelligence on vulcanized blue and white sugar prices to Guo Fuyuan, a shareholder of Tianjin Gongzi Vulcanized Blue Factory (Guo's shares account for two-thirds of the factory's shares), causing Beijing and Tianjin merchants to speculate and rush to purchase.
    Xu Yutian, a clerk in the Chemical Industry Department of the China Industrial Equipment Company, used his position to steal state secrets and supply them to Deng Jihou, manager of Tianjin Xintai Dyeing Material Store. He also colluded with Deng Jihou to arrange for Deng Xiwei (Deng Jihou's younger brother), a Shanghai paint merchant, to work in the Industrial Equipment Company in order to jointly steal state secrets. Xu Yutian admitted that he had provided Deng Jihou with important intelligence many times.
    The above three criminals, Guo Zhonghui, Xu Yutian, and Deng Xiwei, are actually "spies" sent by capitalists into state-owned economic organs.
    The cases of the other five criminals are complex, and the amount of embezzlement is also huge, and they are currently being investigated and dealt with.
    In addition, Du Yu, deputy manager of the China Industrial Equipment Company, and Zhang Haolie, director of the Business Department, are not clean themselves and did not thoroughly confess during the movement. The administrative side of the Central Ministry of Trade has announced their removal from office for investigation.
    All units of the Central Ministry of Trade have decided to concentrate all their efforts in the future, pursue the victory, redouble their efforts, and launch a fierce encirclement and suppression of major embezzlers.

    中央贸易部所属各单位  
    十天捉到大贪污犯十四名  
    现正再接再厉乘胜穷追展开猛烈围攻
    【本报讯】中央人民政府贸易部所属各单位，继捕捉薛崑山、庄志芳等大贪污犯后，近十天来，又在基本建设工程处、中国百货公司等部门捉到十四名大贪污犯。这些大贪污犯，有的是勾结私商，接受贿赂，允许私商偷工减料，帮助私商牟取暴利，盗窃国家资财的蟊贼；有的是混入国营经济机关的奸商和奸商派来的“坐探”。这些事实说明资产阶级对革命阵营的进攻是无孔不入的。
    中央贸易部基本建设工程处在修建砖塔胡同进口公司大楼时，负责这个工程的贸易部工程处北京直属第二工区主任高士彬和助理工程师闵乃光、材料员常哲心等，勾结私营七联营造厂经理陈成德等，进行集体贪污。据高士彬供认，陈成德答应行贿三亿元，高等允许他们偷工减料。据初步统计，已使国家基本建设费损失十亿多元。高士彬供认已先后拿到受贿款九千二百万元。在运动开始时，他曾和同谋者订立“攻守同盟”；到一月二十日以后，他才坦白了自己的贪污行为，并检举了同谋者的部分贪污事实。现在工程处已停止他的职务，令他继续交代。闵乃光勾结私商，允许私商用次木材代替好木材、多开工价、偷工等办法，使国家资财损失至少在一亿七千万元以上。此外，陈成德并答应给他六千万元的贿赂。常哲心勾结包商，浪费钢筋，并以低价拍卖碎钢筋头等，使国家资财损失一亿六千万多元，陈成德曾答应给她五千万元的贿赂。运动开始以来，闵乃光、常哲心坚决与人民为敌，拒不坦白，已被送法院惩处。
    中国百货公司业务处进口科办事员刘蕴珊，负责收购进口物资，据他供认在收购自行车、盘纸等七十三笔交易中，曾接受天津十家私商十二次贿赂计一亿六千九百五十万元。在收购中，他和私商狼狈为奸，替私商说话，为私商牟取暴利。
    中国百货公司业务处进口科科员于孝先，勾结私商，提高收购价格，从中贪污。据初步统计，他在收购自行车链、道林纸、盘纸等交易中，就使国家资财损失三亿多元，他初步供认已接受私商贿赂七千三百多万元。
    中国百货公司调拨科科长张成殿，在天津开设同丰油厂，经常作黄金、银元等黑市买卖，并泄露国家机密。他曾密令他弟弟在汉口套购硷面，指挥他的亲戚于博言到广州进行投机倒把活动，窃取国家资财以自肥，他现在已拥有资金十亿元以上。他是混入国营经济机关的奸商。
    中国百货公司物价科科员郭中慧，经常出卖经济情报，曾把硫化青、白糖价格的情报出卖给天津工字硫化青工厂股东郭福源（郭股占该厂股金的三分之二），致引起北京、天津商人投机抢购。
    中国工业器材公司化工处办事员徐雨田，利用职位，盗窃国家机密，供给天津鑫泰染料行经理邓季厚，又勾结邓季厚安置上海颜料商邓锡伟（邓季厚的弟弟）在工业器材公司工作，以便共同盗窃国家机密。徐雨田承认曾供给邓季厚重要情报多次。
    以上郭中慧、徐雨田、邓锡伟等三犯，实际上是资本家派入国营经济机关的“坐探”。
    另外五犯案情复杂，贪污数目也很巨大，现正在继续检查处理。
    此外，中国工业器材公司副经理杜郁、业务处处长张浩烈，自己手上不干净，在运动中没有彻底坦白，中央贸易部行政方面已宣布把他们撤职查办。
    中央贸易部各单位，决定今后更要集中所有一切力量，乘胜穷追，再接再厉地向大贪污犯展开猛烈的围攻。
