Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 10th:
    Ma Yinchu, a renowned Chinese economist and President of Peking University, gave a talk to a Jiefang Daily reporter on February 8th, refuting the absurd arguments denying the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the working class and the Communist Party over the past three years, such as, "The bourgeoisie has no army, no guns, what are they going to attack with?" "It is clear that your cadres are falling and drowning on their own, but you are blaming others."
    Ma Yinchu said: Now that the people's democratic revolution has been victorious and the leadership of the working class has been established, it is impossible for the bourgeoisie to organize and launch an all-out nationwide struggle for leadership with the working class. However, this does not mean that they have given up their attacks. For the past three years, they have been consciously and deliberately attacking us. He gave several examples: Several cases have occurred at the Bank of China in Beijing, where the bourgeoisie used 10 million per month to buy economic intelligence. Is this not an attack? Almost all major embezzlers in various places are related to illegal merchants. Is this not an attack? Isn't the "alliance of offense and defense" of illegal merchants now an example of an attack on the state collectively?
    The government's assistance to industry and commerce over the past three years has been extremely benevolent and righteous. However, capitalists like the Zhengtai Rubber Factory in Shanghai repay kindness with hatred. By falsely reporting the cost of tires alone, they stole 34.7 billion of state assets. Other cases are imaginable. Can it still be said that they are not attacking?
    Hu Juewen, one of the leaders of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, heard at a meeting in Beijing that the government would be placing large orders for machinery, and immediately notified the enterprises he operated, causing a huge surge in the price of hardware and equipment in Shanghai. Similarly, in Beijing, there was a certain Miao Qiujie, who had served as the "Salt Commissioner" in the Kuomintang government and had close ties with salt merchants. He infiltrated the Central Finance and Economics Commission and, upon hearing that salt taxes were to be increased, sent a telegram. Immediately, the funds of salt merchants in the southeast coast were concentrated, purchasing 17,000 to 18,000 packages. There was no salt on the market, but the salt merchants made a huge profit. Is this not a planned theft of national economic intelligence, disregarding the national economy and the people's livelihood, in order to obtain exorbitant profits?
    Some people say that revolutionary cadres "fall and drown on their own," but revolutionary cadres did not turn bad during their long periods in the countryside. It was only after entering the cities that their thinking changed. For example, Liu Qingshan, who participated in the revolution for twenty years, only became a traitor to the revolution in the past year. Why? Isn't this due to the influence of the bourgeoisie? Isn't it the result of their seduction and corruption? How can it be said that they are "blaming others"?
    Ma Yinchu said: The rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie over the past three years have caused many tangible and intangible losses to the country in various aspects. These losses are difficult to calculate. The arrogance of the bourgeoisie is absolutely not allowed. Our national economy must be led by the state-owned economy and develop towards socialism in an organized and planned manner. We will never allow our country to become a paradise for unscrupulous merchants, speculators, and thieves, a stagnant country, paralyzed and ultimately falling into the abyss of colonialism.
    Ma Yinchu sternly criticized the malicious rumors spread by some people, such as: "The Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns mean that the Common Program is going to be revised!" "Didn't you say four friends and three enemies? Why are you going to overthrow your friends?" Ma Yinchu said: What we want to oppose today is not the bourgeoisie itself, but the bourgeoisie's decadent and degenerate thoughts and behavior. As for the national bourgeoisie, it is still one of the four friends, and the policy has not changed at all. What is the situation now? Four friends are together, three friends are very good, but you, this friend, are creating a mess and disagreeing with the other three friends. Then, those three friends will naturally unite to oppose the mess you are creating. Moreover, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is based on legal grounds. Doesn't Article 18 of the Common Program clearly stipulate that corruption should be severely punished, waste should be prohibited, and bureaucratic styles of work that are divorced from the masses should be opposed?
    Ma Yinchu said: The Common Program was agreed upon by everyone after signing. Article 26 of the Common Program also clearly stipulates: "The fundamental policy of economic construction in the People's Republic of China is to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy through a policy of taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, and exchange between domestic and foreign countries... so that various social economic components can cooperate under the leadership of the state-owned economy, each performing its own function, in order to promote the development of the entire social economy." Isn't this very clear? Only under the premise of "under the leadership of the state-owned economy" can we talk about "division of labor and cooperation, each performing its own function." From this point of view, the Common Program is the basis for guaranteeing the legitimate status and economic interests of industry and commerce, and should be strictly observed. However, the actions of the bourgeoisie today have long deviated from the scope of the Common Program agreed to by their representatives. Taking into account both public and private interests has become harming the public for private gain, which is completely contrary to the Common Program. As for tax evasion, it is even more prohibited by the Common Program. Nationals of the People's Republic of China have the obligation to pay taxes, as stipulated in Article 8 of the Common Program. Therefore, tax evasion is a serious violation of the Common Program. Who is "not being a friend" here? Shouldn't the bourgeoisie's unfriendly behavior be opposed?
    Ma Yinchu said: Shanghai has always been a speculative port, and the trading market is extremely dirty. For a long time, these bad habits have been deeply ingrained. Shanghai's industrialists and businessmen should honestly reform their thinking. Those who have made mistakes in the past should turn back in time, confess their guilt, and re-engage in undertakings that are beneficial to the people, thoroughly eliminating bad thoughts and bad habits. Today, whoever does more for the people, the people will see clearly. Even when entering socialism in the future, the people will not forget their contribution. People in industry and commerce say in words "I want to serve the people," but "serving the people" cannot be understood only from words, but must be done from the bottom of the heart. In the past era of reactionary rule, whoever could evade taxes and whose means were cleverer was respected by relatives and friends. Now the times are different. Bribery and tax evasion are considered shameful because they infringe upon the interests of the people, commit crimes against the people, and are abandoned by the people.
    Ma Yinchu placed great expectations on the 160,000 shop employees and workers in Shanghai. He said: The illegal merchants in Shanghai are extremely cunning. One merchant has four sets of books, all of which are fake. The real books are in his own belly. Shop employees and workers should take brave action to uncover that hidden book, stand firm, distinguish between good and evil, and resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks!

### 马寅初对上海解放日报记者发表谈话  驳斥资产阶级的荒谬论调

    马寅初对上海解放日报记者发表谈话
    驳斥资产阶级的荒谬论调
    【新华社上海十日电】中国著名经济学家、北京大学校长马寅初二月八日对解放日报记者发表谈话，驳斥所谓“资产阶级一无军队，二无枪炮，拿什么来进攻？”“明明是你们的干部自行失足落水，却嫁祸于人”等等否认资产阶级三年以来对工人阶级、共产党猖狂进攻的种种荒谬言论。
    马寅初说：在人民民主革命已经取得胜利、工人阶级的领导权已经确立的今天，资产阶级是不可能有组织地在全国范围内全体规模上向工人阶级争夺领导权的，但是，这决不是说它们就放弃了进攻，三年以来，它们在有意识有计划地向我们进攻。他举了几个例子说：北京中国银行发生好几件案子，资产阶级用一千万一个月来收买经济情报，这不是进攻是什么？各地所有的大贪污犯几乎都与不法商人有关，这不是进攻是什么？现在不法商人的“攻守同盟”岂不是向国家集体进攻的一例吗？
    政府三年来对工商界的扶助是仁至义尽的。但是像上海正泰橡胶厂的资方，以怨报德，仅仅谎报轮胎成本一项，就盗骗国家资财达三百四十七亿，其他可想而知，这还能说不是他们在进攻吗？
    上海市工商业联合会负责人之一胡厥文在北京开会时，听到政府将有大量的机器定货，立刻通知他所经营的企业，引起了上海五金器材的巨大涨风。又如在北京有一个曾在国民党政府里做过“盐务总办”的缪秋杰，和盐商关系密切，他混进中央财委机关里来，听说盐税要加了，一个电报，东南沿海盐商的资金立刻集中，收进一万七八千包，市场上没有盐了，盐商却大发其财，这还不是他们在有计划地盗窃国家经济情报，不顾国计民生，从中获得暴利么？
    有人说革命干部是“自行失足落水”的，但是，革命干部们长时期在农村中没有变坏，进城以后，思想上才起了变化。如刘青山，参加革命二十年，成为革命的叛徒却只是最近一年的事。为什么呢？这还不是受了资产阶级的影响吗？还不是他们引诱、腐蚀的结果吗？怎么能说“嫁祸于人”呢？
    马寅初说：资产阶级三年来的猖狂进攻，已经使国家在各方面都遭受到很多有形或无形的损失，这些损失，是很难计算的。资产阶级如此嚣张，是决不允许的。我们的国家经济必须是以国营经济为领导的，有组织有计划地向社会主义发展，我们决不允许我们的国家成为一个奸商、投机家、小偷们冒险的乐园，成为一个趑趄不前的，混身瘫痪而最后又落到殖民地深坑里去的国家。
    马寅初严正地批判了某些人散布的恶意的谣言，如：“搞三反、五反，要修改共同纲领了！”“你们不是说四个朋友三个敌人吗？怎么要打倒朋友了？”马寅初说：我们今天要反掉的，并不是资产阶级，而是资产阶级的腐朽堕落思想和行为。至于民族资产阶级，仍然是四个朋友的一个，政策一点也没有变。现在是什么情况呢？四个朋友在一起，三个朋友都很好，但是你这个朋友却拆了烂污，和那三个朋友过意不去，那么，那三个朋友自然要联合起来，反掉你拆的烂污了。何况反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，是有法律根据的。共同纲领第十八条，不是明白规定严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风吗？
    马寅初说：共同纲领是大家签字同意的。共同纲领第二十六条，又明明白白地规定：“中华人民共和国经济建设的根本方针，是以公私兼顾、劳资两利、城乡互助、内外交流的政策，达到发展生产、繁荣经济之目的。……使各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展。”这不是很明白吗？必须是“在国营经济领导”的前提之下，才能谈到“分工合作，各得其所”。由此看来，共同纲领是工商界所赖以保障正当企业合法地位和经济利益的，理应严格地遵守。但是今天资产阶级的所作所为，早已脱出了为他们的代表人物所签字同意的共同纲领的范围，公私兼顾变成以私害公，完全和共同纲领相反。至于偷税漏税，更为共同纲领所不许。中华人民共和国国民有缴纳赋税的义务，为共同纲领第八条所规定，因此逃税偷税是严重地违反共同纲领的。这是谁“不够朋友”呢？资产阶级的这种不够朋友的行为，难道还不应该反掉吗？
    马寅初说：上海过去一直是投机码头，交易市场上是极其龌龊的，长时期以来，这些恶习已经根深蒂固。上海的工商业家，应该老老实实地改造思想，过去有错误的，应该及时回过头来，低头认罪，重新从事有利于人民的事业，彻底清除坏思想和坏作风。今天谁替人民多做一分事，人民是看得清的，就是到将来进入社会主义的时候，人民也忘不了他的这一分功绩。工商界人士口头上都说“我要为人民服务”，但“为人民服务”不能仅从口头上去了解，还要从心底里做到为人民服务。在过去反动统治时代，谁能偷漏税款，谁的手段高，谁就受亲友尊敬。现在时代不同了，行贿偷税被视为可耻，因为它侵害人民的利益，就对人民犯了罪，就为人民所共弃。
    马寅初对上海的十六万店员工人寄予极大的期望。他说：上海的不法商人是极其狡猾的，有一个商人有四本账，四本都是假账，真的账在他自己肚子里，店员工人们应该勇敢地行动起来，揭开那本隐蔽的账簿，站稳立场，分别善恶，坚决地击退资产阶级的猖狂进攻！
