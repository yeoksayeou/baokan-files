    Communist Youth League Member Yang Junqing is How Organized Expose and Accusation
    Communist Youth League Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Work Committee Propaganda Department
    During the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, Yang Junqing, a Communist Youth League member from the Inspection Section of the Finance Department of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration, and the trade union group he led in the ticket clearing team, assisted the leadership and exposed a total of 189 corruption cases, both large and small, which powerfully promoted the movement. Yang Junqing's group had a total of eighteen members, including three League members, seven young workers, and eight adult and older workers. During the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, this group exposed twenty-one counter-revolutionary elements and was therefore selected as a model trade union group of the Administration. Yang Junqing also gloriously participated in the Third National Railway Labor Model Conference. After the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, Yang Junqing led the entire group to take active action and achieved outstanding results. Zhang Zhisheng, Deputy Director of the Zhengzhou Railway Administration and Chairman of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Committee, publicly praised them at an emergency mobilization meeting for the Administration's organs to expose corruption and called on all Communist Youth League members and all employees to learn from them and ensure the success of the movement with a spirit of responsibility to state property.

    At the very beginning of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, Yang Junqing first led his group to establish a "Three-Anti Pact" and a study system, stipulating that documents should be studied from 7:00 to 8:00 every morning, focusing on reading newspapers, linking with thoughts, and展开 discussion. Yang Junqing himself was a member of the Communist Youth League branch committee. He often told his comrades in the group what he had learned in the League, explaining that this movement was a "battle between the thoughts of the working class and the bourgeoisie," an "important step towards socialism in the future," and "personally led by Chairman Mao." For those comrades who had ideological concerns, he addressed their different situations and opened up their minds. For example, some comrades had been less than clean in the past and were afraid that confessing would "lose face" and "be punished." Yang Junqing repeatedly explained the Party's policies, read newspapers to them, and reminded them, "Do you want the true face of the working class, or the false face of the bourgeoisie?" When the young worker Li Yuhua concealed a period of his history during the "cadre review," he carried a burden on his mind for a long time. Yang Junqing helped him explain the problem to the organization and encouraged him, "Old Li, you didn't perform well during the 'cadre review,' but you must work harder in this movement and strive to earn merit." After such mobilization, all the comrades in Yang Junqing's group clearly recognized the great significance of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, clarified their thoughts, and were therefore very energetic and confident. They pledged: "The Yang Junqing group is a model group. It made contributions in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in the past, and it must make contributions in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy now." The older workers said:
    "Strive to join the Party in this movement." The young workers said: "Strive to join the League in this movement."

    The central slogan of Yang Junqing's group in this movement was: "Clean yourself, expose others." After they overcame various ideological concerns, some compared themselves with the People's Liberation Army, saying: "The comrades of the People's Liberation Army do not take even a needle or a thread from the common people. Compared with the comrades of the People's Liberation Army, we are guilty." In order to further enlighten the masses, Yang Junqing took the lead in conducting self-criticism and confessed that he had sold twenty jin of kerosene when he was transferred from Xi'an to Zhengzhou. He painfully检讨 and said: "I was originally a poor worker, but I was influenced by bourgeois ideology and became a 'happy' little thief." Under Yang Junqing's leadership, others confessed to their embezzlement, theft, and mixing public and private affairs. After such a stage of self-exposure, after clearing their own problems, they had the courage to help and expose others. Yang Junqing said: "We must first clean ourselves up and sort out the internal affairs. Without this, the movement cannot be carried out."

    On the basis of "cleaning yourself," Yang Junqing's group launched a large-scale expose and accusation campaign, creating the "sparrow warfare" method. They divided the entire group of eighteen people into six or seven small groups, scattered them to all departments and businesses related to the railway, and widely collected materials. According to their own explanation, this approach is called "drawing lines everywhere, drilling into every hole." They not only went to large places such as construction factories and printing factories to collect materials, but also went to small places such as tailor shops and soy sauce gardens to collect materials. They not only collected materials in Zhengzhou, but also used Sundays to collect materials in Kaifeng, Ji County, Xinxiang and other places. They said: "We must have the determination to be rebuffed everywhere." "It is best to be able to collect materials, and it also serves as publicity if we can't." Yang Junqing said:
    "This is a spirit of bullheadedness!" It is this spirit of bullheadedness, this spirit of being earnestly responsible for the wealth of the country, that supported them in creating an astonishing record of continuously exposing 189 corruption and bribery cases, large and small, in this movement, setting an example for Communist Youth League members.

    From many exposures, it can be seen that the work of Yang Junqing's group was arduous, meticulous, and in-depth. When the Finance Department organized forces to expose the corruption facts of corrupt elements such as Zhang Yaoru and Cai Haoran in the Inspection Section, Yang Junqing's group took the lead. They first exposed Zhang Yaoru's shameful act of issuing obituaries everywhere and fraudulently obtaining money on the pretext of his brother's death. Then, through the more than 20 calendars Cai Haoran had obtained from private businessmen last year, they found clues, tracked them down, and found "Hua Taixiang," a printing business that often had dealings with Cai and Zhang. After six or seven persuasions, they finally exposed more than ten cases of corruption and bribery. Among them, in 1949, Zhang, Cai, and others had printed a batch of package tickets at Hua Taixiang. They colluded with each other and stole a large amount of state wealth (value to be determined) by raising prices and reducing the quality of paper. The boss of Hua Taixiang once said to the shop assistants: "If this business is done well, we can eat and use it for thirty years." At the same time, from this case, they also discovered and exposed the corruption facts of more than ten cadres in the Personnel Department and the General Affairs Department. For example, Chen Yongzhi of the General Affairs Department accepted huge bribes from private businessmen when he handled the printing of employee symbols in 1949, and the amount was equivalent to more than 10 million yuan in RMB. The work of Yang Junqing's group was very meticulous. For example, at the beginning of the movement, group member Geng Zhanhua suddenly remembered that he often heard the sound of steel rails being knocked when he passed the Yihe Iron Factory on his way home from get off work every day, so based on this clue, they found this private factory. On the first day, the manager was not there. On the second day, the manager avoided seeing them. On the third day, they finally found the manager. After some persuasion, the manager confessed to several acts of bribery to railway staff. Among them, Zheng of the Procurement Section of the Materials Department accepted a bribe of hundreds of thousands of yuan when he handled the order for anti-climbing devices. According to shop assistants:
    "The people of Yihe Iron Factory could hardly even eat before liberation,
    Now they have made a fortune." The scope of Yang Junqing's group's exposure was very wide. They not only exposed corrupt elements in Zhengzhou, but also exposed those who were not in Zhengzhou. They not only exposed direct acts of embezzlement and theft, but also exposed various forms of embezzlement and theft. For example, Ma Hao exposed such a thing: A cadre named Hou Yimin in the printing factory pretended to be a supply-system cadre in the village, hung up a
    "Glory Plaque" at the door of his house, and fraudulently received pork and white flour from the district government every year during festivals. At the same time, in the process of exposure, the comrades of Yang Junqing's group further improved their awareness and exposed their relatives and friends. Young workers Zhai Yongchang and Liu Yunlong were such people. They not only exposed a large number of others, but also exposed their father's illegal acts of stealing and selling kerosene and illegally using free tickets. The above examples are countless in Yang Junqing's group's rich expose and accusation materials. According to preliminary statistics, from January 15 to 26, Yang Junqing's group exposed a total of 157 cases of embezzlement, bribery, theft of public property, and挪用 public funds, one case of concealed purchase of enemy and puppet materials, and also exposed three leads of spies, one local tyrant, and eight cases of drug trafficking, totaling 189 cases, large and small, with赃款 amounting to 150,093,300 yuan. If we also calculate the losses to state property caused by the various wasteful facts they have exposed, it will amount to more than 240 million yuan.

    The organizational role of the Communist Youth League cannot be ignored in the reason why Yang Junqing's group has made such great achievements. Yang Junqing himself is a member of the Communist Youth League branch committee. Many problems are studied and matured at the League branch committee meeting before being brought to the group for discussion and implementation. The League branch grasped the two young workers in his group, Sha Baolin and Wang Jundong, often had individual talks with them, educating them on how to play the role of young people, how to strive to earn merit and join the League, and successively held four meetings of young worker activists, publicly praising them at the meetings and promptly helping them summarize and disseminate their experiences. Facts have proved that the leadership of the League system is indispensable in the movement.

    Since the launch of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, Yang Junqing's group has been working hard and tirelessly under the leadership of Communist Youth League member Yang Junqing. They get up before dawn and sleep late at night, and no one is idle. Even the more than sixty-year-old Ye Genbao moved and organized and transcribed materials every day, and has even been sick these days. Yang Junqing simply moved the quilt from his home to the office and worked until the next time. He said: "I am a Communist Youth League member. In the struggle to打击 the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, Communist Youth League members should stand at the forefront!"

    青年团员杨俊清是怎样组织检举的
    青年团郑州铁路局工作委员会宣传部
    郑州铁路管理局财务处检查科青年团员杨俊清和他所领导的清票组工会小组，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，协助领导，前后共检举了大小贪污案一百八十九件，有力地推动了运动。杨俊清小组共有组员十八名，其中团员三名、青年工人七名、成年老年工人八名。在镇压反革命运动中，这个小组曾检举了二十一名反革命分子，因而被选为管理局的模范工会小组；杨俊清并光荣地参加了全路第三届劳动模范大会。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，杨俊清又领导全组积极行动起来，创造了卓越的成绩。郑州铁路管理局增产节约委员会主任委员张之生副局长，在管理局机关反贪污运动进入检举阶段的紧急动员大会上，曾当众表扬了他们，并号召所有的青年团员及全体职工向他们学习，以对国家财产负责的精神，保证把这个运动搞好。
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动刚开始的时候，杨俊清首先领导他的小组订立了“三反公约”，建立了学习制度，规定每天早晨七至八时学习文件，以读报为主，联系思想，展开讨论。杨俊清自己是青年团的支部委员，他经常把在团内学到的东西告诉给小组的同志们，说明这一运动是“工人阶级的思想和资产阶级的思想打仗”，是“将来走向社会主义的重要步骤”，而且是“毛主席亲自领导的”。对于那些有着思想顾虑的同志，则针对他们不同的情况，分别打通思想。例如：个别同志过去曾有些手脸不干净的地方，害怕坦白了“丢面子”、“受处分”，杨俊清便反复讲解党的政策，读报给他们听，并提醒他们说：“是要工人阶级的真面子呢？还是要资产阶级的假面子呢？”青年工人李玉华在“审干”时隐瞒了自己的一段历史，思想上长期背了个包袱，杨俊清便帮助他把问题向组织上作了交代，并鼓励他说：“老李，在‘审干’时你表现得不好，在这个运动里可得多卖些劲，争取立功。”经过这样的动员，杨俊清小组全体同志都明确认识了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的伟大意义，澄清了思想，因此便劲头很足，信心很高。他们提出保证说：“杨俊清小组是个模范小组，过去在镇压反革命运动中立了功，现在在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中还得立功。”老年工人说：
    “争取在这一运动中入党。”青年工人说：“争取在这一运动中入团。”
    杨俊清小组在这一运动中的中心口号是：“擦净自己，检举别人”。当他们克服了各种思想顾虑以后，有的就把自己和解放军对比，说：“解放军同志连老百姓的一针一线也不拿，咱和解放军同志比起来可就罪大了。”杨俊清为了进一步启发群众，便带头进行自我检查，交代了从西安调来郑州时贩卖煤油二十斤的事，并痛心地检讨说：“我本是一个贫苦的工人，可是受了资产阶级思想的影响，却成了一个‘快乐的’小贼。”在杨俊清的带头下，其他人纷纷坦白了自己贪污、盗窃、公私不分等行为。经过这样一个自我暴露的阶段，自己的问题交代清楚了，帮助和检举别人便有了勇气。杨俊清说：“必须首先洗刷自己，整理内部，不这样运动便没法搞起来。”
    在“擦净自己”的基础上，杨俊清小组展开了大规模的检举工作，创造了“麻雀战”的方法。他们把全组十八个人分成六、七个小组，分散到一切和铁路有关系的部门、商号去，广泛搜集材料。这种作法，根据他们自己的说法，叫做“到处牵线，无孔不钻”。他们不但到营造厂、印刷厂等大的地方去搜集材料，而且也到裁缝店、酱园等小的地方去搜集材料；他们不仅在郑州一个地方搜集材料，而且也利用星期日到开封、汲县、新乡等地去收集材料。他们说：“要有到处碰钉子的决心。”“能搜集到材料最好，搜集不到也作了宣传”。杨俊清说：
    “这是一股牛劲！”也就是这股牛劲，这种对国家财富认真负责的精神，支持着他们在这一运动中创造了连续检举一百八十九件大小贪污受贿案的惊人纪录，为青年团员创立了榜样。
    从许多次的检举中，能够看出杨俊清小组的工作是艰苦、细致、深入的。当财务处组织力量检举检查科贪污分子章耀如、蔡浩然等的贪污事实时，杨俊清小组打了头炮。他们首先检举了章耀如利用哥哥病死的机会，到处发讣文，骗诈钱财的可耻行为。然后通过蔡浩然去年从私商那里弄来的二十余份日历，找出线索，跟踪追击，寻到了经常和蔡、章往来的印刷业的“华泰祥”。经过六、七次的动员说服，终于揭发了十余起贪污受贿事实。其中一九四九年章、蔡等曾经手在华泰祥印制包裹票一批，他们互相勾结，用提高价格、降低纸张质量的办法，窃盗了大量国家财富（价值尚待统计）。华泰祥的老板曾对店员说：“这笔生意如果做得好，三十年也吃用不尽。”同时，从这一宗案件，他们又发现并检举了人事处、总务处十余名干部的贪污事实。如总务处的陈永志，一九四九年经手印制员工配带的符号时，便接受私商巨额贿赂，其款项折合人民币达一千万元以上。杨俊清小组的工作是非常细致的。例如：运动刚开始时，组员耿占华突然想起每天下班回家路过义合铁工厂时，常听见里面有敲钢轨的声音，就根据这样一点线索，他们找到这家私营工厂去。第一天，经理不在，第二天，经理避而不见，第三天，终于把经理找到了。也是经过一番动员之后，经理坦白了向铁路工作人员的若干行贿事实，其中材料处采购科郑某在经手订制防爬器时，便接受了一百数十万元的贿赂。据店员反映：
    “义合铁工厂的人在解放前夕连饭都几乎吃不上，
    现在可发了洋财了。”杨俊清小组检举的范围是非常广泛的，他们不仅检举了在郑州的贪污分子，而且检举了不在郑州的，他们不仅检举了直接的贪污盗窃行为，而且也检举了各种变相的贪污盗窃行为。例如：马豪便检举了这么一件事：印刷厂一位名叫侯一民的干部，在村里冒充供给制干部，家门口挂
    “光荣牌”，每逢年节便向区政府冒领猪肉、白面等。同时，在检举过程中，杨俊清小组的同志们自己也更进一步提高了觉悟，检举了自己的亲戚朋友。青工翟永昌、刘云龙便是这样的人。他们不仅大量检举了别人，而且还检举了自己的父亲盗卖煤油，非法使用免票等不法行为。以上的例子，在杨俊清小组丰富的检举材料中是不胜枚举的。据初步统计，从一月十五日到二十六日，杨俊清小组共检举了贪污、受贿、盗卖公物、挪用公款案一百五十七件，隐购敌伪物资案一件，此外并检举了特务线索三件、恶霸一名、贩毒案八件，共计大小一百八十九件，赃款达一亿五千零九十三万三千元。若把他们所揭发的各种浪费事实给国家财产所造成的损失也计算在内，则达二亿四千万元以上。
    杨俊清小组之所以做出这样大的成绩，青年团的组织作用是不容忽视的。杨俊清自己是青年团支部委员，许多问题都是在团支委会上研究成熟后，再带到小组中去讨论执行。团支部抓住了他组里的青工小组长沙宝林、王俊东两人，经常和他们作个别谈话，教育他们如何发挥青年人的作用，如何争取立功入团，并先后召开了四次青工积极分子会议，会上当众表扬了他们，并及时帮助他们总结和传播了经验。事实证明：运动中团的系统领导是不可少的。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展以来，杨俊清小组在青年团员杨俊清的带头和领导下紧张不倦地工作着。他们起三更，睡半夜，没有一人闲着。连六十多岁的叶根宝也动了起来，每天整理、誊写材料，这几天甚至忙病了。杨俊清更干脆把被子从家里搬到办公室来，一工作便到下一点。他说：“我是一个青年团员。在打击资产阶级猖狂进攻的斗争中，青年团员应该站在最前面！”
