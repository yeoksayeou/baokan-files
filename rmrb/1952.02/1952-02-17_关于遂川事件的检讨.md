Editor's Note: The news of the degeneration and deterioration of most members of the Suichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangxi Province, and the disciplinary actions taken against them, was published in the "Party Life" column on page three of this newspaper on January 23rd. The Suichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has been re-established. Now, the Ji'an Prefectural Committee and the Suichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have made self-criticisms and reviews of the Suichuan incident and have begun to learn from past lessons and improve their work, which is necessary. However, we believe that in these two documents, the eradication of bourgeois reactionary ideology has not been put forward as the main issue, and there is no profound understanding that the degeneration and deterioration of most members of the Suichuan County Committee is precisely the result of the rampant attack of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, most of the self-criticisms made in these two documents and the future solutions proposed focus on improving leadership methods and work methods, which, although very necessary, are far from enough. It is hoped that the Ji'an Prefectural Committee and the Suichuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will further draw a clear line on class distinctions ideologically and more profoundly accept the painful lessons of the Suichuan incident.

    Self-Criticism Regarding the Suichuan Incident
    Ji'an Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Jiangxi

    At the Third Party Congress of Jiangxi Province last July, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee exposed the serious errors of the Suichuan County Committee and made a decision on punishment. All comrades of the Ji'an Prefectural Committee and all party member cadres in the Ji'an Special District resolutely support the Jiangxi Provincial Committee's decision to expel Jiao Ergong, Lu Bin, and Wang Zhirong from the Party and to punish Sun Yuanfa and Han Feng, and sincerely accept the punishment given to the Prefectural Committee by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee. The degeneration and deterioration of the Suichuan County Committee has provided an extremely profound education for all party member cadres in the Ji'an Special District and has aroused the vigilance of party organizations at all levels. It has greatly promoted the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement currently being carried out throughout the special district.

    Under the situation of the nationwide revolutionary victory, the leading organs and some party member cadres of the Suichuan County Committee were corroded by the bourgeoisie and developed ideas of being meritorious officials, underestimating the enemy, being complacent and corrupt, which led to the formation of an extremely serious style of extravagance, waste, corruption, and embezzlement, seriously violating the financial system; serious factional struggles arose within the organization, and the leadership showed serious bureaucratic style, with patriarchal practices replacing the party's democracy and criticism and self-criticism. Coercive orders were imposed on the masses, the class stance was lost, and there was degeneration and deterioration. These serious errors have had a very bad influence on the Party and the People's Government among the masses and have caused huge losses to the property of the state and the people.

    The reason why such serious errors persisted for a long time is that in addition to the former Suichuan County Committee bearing the primary responsibility, the Ji'an Prefectural Committee also committed serious bureaucratic errors. We only saw the positive side of the Suichuan County Committee's work, believing that they cooperated with the troops to capture the bandit leader Xiao Jia Bi alive, and the masses had a good response; therefore, we did not pay enough attention to their errors. As early as March of the year before last, the Prefectural Committee had discovered some errors in the Suichuan County Committee and some district-level cadres and had sent people to inspect the Duiqian District, but due to insufficient attention, we lightly believed the opinions of the Suichuan County Committee and denied these materials. After May, the errors of the County Committee also began to be exposed, but we did not send people to deal with them in time, and it was not until the spring of 1951 that we dealt with them.

    Secondly, it was also because the Ji'an Prefectural Committee, in the situation of nationwide revolutionary victory, was also overwhelmed by the victory, and did not have enough understanding of the fact that some comrades might not be able to withstand the test of this great transition from war to peace and from rural areas to cities, and become arrogant, complacent, slack, and indulge in pleasure. We also had insufficient understanding of the danger of bourgeois erosion, lacked due vigilance, and showed numbness and insensitivity to the extravagant, wasteful, corrupt, and degenerate thoughts and behaviors of the Suichuan County Committee, and failed to persist in the struggle.

    The lesson of the Suichuan incident tells us that to do a good job in leadership, we must constantly go deep into the lower levels to check work, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner; we must constantly strengthen the party's political and ideological leadership and understand the cadres at all times. In the past, the Prefectural Committee lacked understanding of the cadres in Suichuan County and committed serious bureaucratic errors, lacking ideological leadership, so that there was no democracy, no criticism and self-criticism within the Suichuan County Party, and many errors were hidden in the party for a long time without being exposed in time, and the unhealthy trends within the party prevailed. Therefore, in the future, we must strengthen the committee system and the democratic system within the party, carry out serious criticism and self-criticism within the party, strictly enforce the party's organizational life, listen more to the opinions of the masses, and strengthen the education of party members and cadres.

    The Suichuan incident is a painful lesson for us. The Ji'an local party organization and even every party member must deeply remember this painful lesson, respond to the call of the higher party committee, resolutely launch a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the Ji'an Special District, and strive to further consolidate the party's fighting ranks politically, ideologically, and organizationally.

### 关于遂川事件的检讨
中共江西吉安地委会

第3版()
专栏：党的生活

    编者按：中共江西遂川县委大部成员蜕化变质受到党纪处分的消息，已在一月二十三日本报三版“党的生活”栏发表。中共遂川县委会已重新建立。现在，中共吉安地委会和遂川县委会对遂川事件作了检讨和检查，并开始接受过去的教训、改进工作，这是必要的。但是，我们认为在这两个文件中，都还没有把肃清资产阶级反动思想当作主要问题提出来，没有深刻地认识到遂川县委大部成员的堕落蜕化正是资产阶级猖狂进攻的结果。因而这两个文件中所作的检讨和所提出的今后的办法中，多半是着重在领导方法和工作方法上求得改进，这虽然是非常必要的，但却是十分不够的。希望中共吉安地委和遂川县委着重在思想上进一步划清阶级界限，更深刻地接受遂川事件的沉痛教训。
    关于遂川事件的检讨
    中共江西吉安地委会
    中共江西省委于去年七月在全省第三次党代表会上揭发了遂川县委的严重错误，并作出关于处分的决定。吉安地委的全体同志以及吉安专区的全体党员干部，坚决拥护江西省委开除焦尔恭、鲁斌、王志荣的党籍和给孙元发、韩峰的处分，并一致诚恳接受江西省委给地委的处分。遂川县委蜕化变质的事件，使吉安专区全体党员干部受了一次极其深刻的教育，并引起各级党组织的警惕。对全专区目前正在普遍开展的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动有极大推动作用。
    遂川县委的领导机关和部分党员干部，在全国革命胜利的形势下，受了资产阶级的腐蚀，产生了功臣自居、轻敌麻痹、享乐腐化的思想，以致形成了极端严重的铺张浪费贪污腐化作风，严重地违犯了财政制度；在组织内部产生了严重的宗派斗争，领导方面表现出严重的官僚主义作风，家长制代替了党的民主和批评与自我批评，对群众实行强迫命令，丧失阶级立场，堕落蜕化。这些严重的错误，给党和人民政府在群众中造成极坏的影响，使国家和人民的财产遭受了巨大的损失。
    这样严重的错误之所以长期存在，除了前遂川县委要负主要责任外，也由于吉安地委犯了严重的官僚主义错误，我们只看见遂川县委工作成绩的一面，认为他们配合部队活捉了匪首萧家壁，群众有了好的反映；因而对其错误的一面就没有引起高度的注意。早在前年三月间地委即已发现遂川县委会及一部分区级干部的一些错误，并曾派人去堆前区检查过，但由于重视不够，遂至轻信遂川县委的意见而否定了这些材料。到五月以后县委的错误也开始暴露，但又没有及时派人去处理，一直拖到一九五一年春才作处理。
    其次，是由于吉安地委同样在全国革命胜利形势下，被胜利冲昏了头脑，对于在由战争到和平、由农村到城市这一巨大转变中，某些同志可能经不起这一转变的考验而骄傲自满、松劲麻痹、贪图享乐这一点没有足够的认识，对资产阶级侵蚀的危险性也认识不足，缺乏应有的警惕性，对遂川县委的铺张浪费、贪污蜕化的思想行为，表现了麻木不仁，没有坚持斗争。
    遂川事件的教训告诉我们，要做好领导工作，必须要不断深入下层检查工作，发现问题，并及时解决问题；要不断加强党的政治思想领导并随时了解干部。地委过去对遂川县的干部缺乏了解，又犯了严重的官僚主义的错误，缺乏思想领导，以致在遂川县党内没有民主，没有批评和自我批评，使其许多错误长期隐藏在党内没有及时揭发出来，党内歪风占了优势。因此今后必须加强党委制和党内民主制度，在党内开展严肃的批评和自我批评，严格党的组织生活，多倾听群众的意见，加强党员干部的教育。
    遂川事件对我们是一个惨痛的教训，吉安地方党的组织以至每个党员必须深刻地记住这一沉痛的教训，响应上级党委的号召，在吉安专区坚决开展反贪污反浪费反官僚主义的斗争，为进一步从政治上思想上组织上巩固党的战斗队伍而奋斗。
