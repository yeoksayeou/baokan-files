Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 21st: Unscrupulous merchants are massively stealing national assets in the Huai River project, causing great damage to the great construction related to the lives and property of 55 million people in the Huai River basin. These merchants cut corners in contracted projects, sell inferior goods as good, old as new, and report less as more when selling various materials for the Huai River project. They even send "moles" into the Huai River organization's interior, planning to organize embezzlement groups and blatantly steal assets. Sun Yingcai, the manager of Jinan Lisheng Trading Company, is one of these illegal capitalists. Last year, the Huai River Commission purchased a large number of current meters, theodolites, stopwatches, levels, and telescopes and other hydrological and surveying instruments from Lisheng Trading Company. In order to carry out fraud, Sun Yingcai first dragged the assistant engineer Zhao Zuyi, who was in charge of purchasing instruments, and the deputy engineer Chen Jinlin, who was in charge of inspecting instruments, into the water. Then, he used a large number of shoddy and even unusable old goods to impersonate new goods and sell them to the Huai River Commission, resulting in illegal profits of 380 million yuan. Because these instruments were broken and old, the hydrological records of the Huai River and its tributaries from more than 150 hydrological and rainfall stations over the past eight months have lost their due accuracy. The hard work of hundreds of workers and technicians at hydrological and rainfall stations for eight months, braving wind and rain, was mostly in vain. But the most heartbreaking thing is not the significant loss of manpower and financial resources, but the inaccurate hydrological records, which make the design of future Huai River projects lose precise basis, seriously affecting the progress of the Huai River project. In addition to seeking illegal profits, Sun Yingcai often stole equipment from within the Huai River organization. Last year, he traveled from Jinan to Bengbu for this purpose, colluding with Zhao Zuyi, Chen Jinlin, Gao Shengqi, Zhu Xiaobai and other engineering personnel from the engineering department of the Huai River Commission to form an embezzlement group. Chen Jinlin and others stole drawing instruments, drawing rulers, tape measures, cameras and other equipment from within the Huai River Commission, and then sold them to the Huai River Commission in the name of Lisheng Trading Company, and shared the spoils. Sun Yingcai later simply won over Zhao Zuyi, Chen Jinlin and others to become shareholders, preparing to open a branch of Lisheng Trading Company in Bengbu, buying and selling without capital, specializing in the Huai River Commission's business, in order to steal the people's assets on a larger scale.

Shanghai merchant Li Hanmin (originally a broker) stole more than 600 million yuan of national assets in just one year through a purchasing agent. He slightly painted a 370,000 yuan jack (used on cars) and replaced it with a fake trademark, marking the price at 1.35 million yuan; he brushed a new coat of paint on an old generator worth 200 million yuan, impersonating it as a new product, marking the price at 280 million yuan; of the 1,000 handcarts he commissioned Cifeng Vehicle Parts Store to order, 700 were substandard and cut corners when delivered. Some of these materials could not be used at all when they were transported to the construction site, and some broke as soon as they were used, seriously affecting the progress of the project. Of the 3,300 tricycles that Li Hanmin handled, half have been damaged and cannot be used. Two generators that were disguised as new products were transported to the Banqiao Reservoir construction site and often had power outages, affecting 50,000 migrant workers from working the night shift. Most of the eighteen cylinder liners used on bulldozers were defective, which caused five bulldozers to stop working on the construction site, delaying 15,000 cubic meters of compaction work every day. Because the joints of the water pipes of the water pump were missing enamel discs, they could not be started when they were transported to the Baisha Reservoir construction site. The accumulated water on the construction site could not be drained, resulting in 120,000 migrant workers being unable to work smoothly for four or five days, wasting a lot of manpower.

The four sluice gates that the Henan Huai River Headquarters ordered from the Shanghai First Machine Shipbuilding United Company have now been found to be substandard: the weight of the sluice gates is insufficient, the winch on the sluice gate lacks two handwheels, the most important shaft is wrapped in a layer of bad copper (good copper should be used), and the screw caps are also broken and old. The four sluice gates worth 900 million yuan have thus become waste and cannot be used. Fortunately, these four sluice gates have not yet been installed. If they are installed, it is likely that the sluice gates will leak and cause flooding.

Nine lumber companies in Nanjing, including Yida, Jingcheng, and Taicheng, sold inferior wood as good goods to the Huai River Commission, which also seriously affected the Huai River project. Last spring, in order to rush to repair a sluice gate before the summer flood season, the Huai River Commission sent cadres Zhao Zhongxiu and others to Nanjing to purchase wood. Dai Yunxiao and other persons in charge of Yida Lumber Company viciously dragged Zhao Zhongxiu into the water and jointly stole the people's assets. Among the 6,000 pile timbers that were traded, it was originally agreed to use "Guang wood", but when the goods were delivered, the unscrupulous merchants mixed in a large number of Wuning wood from Jiangxi, which has the worst quality; in the 10,000 feet of foreign pine, a lot of blackened, cracked, and collapsed old boards were also mixed in. The unscrupulous merchants believed that the Huai River urgently needed wood, so they raised the price of wood, increasing it by about one time. Yida and Jingcheng Lumber Companies alone made illegal profits of more than 200 million yuan as a result.

In order to seek greater illegal profits, unscrupulous capitalists sent agents to the interior of the Huai River organization as "moles" and often stole engineering intelligence. Xie Shumo, an engineer from the Subei Water Conservancy Bureau, was an agent for more than ten construction factories in Yangzhou, including Wang Dianji and Weida. Xie Shumo used to work in the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction of the Kuomintang reactionary government and has always had close ties with these unscrupulous merchants. In November 1950, when the Huai River project began, construction factories such as Wang Dianji gave money and clothes to Xie Shumo, asking him to participate in the Huai River work. Therefore, Xie Shumo tried to sneak into the then Huai River Downstream Canal Engineering Bureau as a deputy engineer, as an inside line for the unscrupulous merchants. At that time, there were twelve culverts to be built in the Canal project. After the design, bids were invited. Xie Shumo told the unscrupulous merchants all the designs and bottom prices of these culverts, and also copied the budget for the twelve culverts submitted to the higher authorities to the unscrupulous merchants. Therefore, all the unscrupulous merchants who bid won the bid. When negotiating the price, Xie Shumo deliberately raised the price, so that the unscrupulous merchants made huge profits. Xie Shumo therefore received bribes of more than 100 million yuan from the unscrupulous merchants. The unscrupulous merchants cut corners without any scruples during construction. 80% of the materials for the twelve culverts were substandard, the steel bars were old, and the milling bars for opening the gates were also substandard. Many culverts had just been completed, and the cave body and wing walls had cracks. Now, these projects must be repaired again.

Unlawful capitalists only care about their own interests and unscrupulously sabotage the Huai River project. The people in the Huai River basin have long been in disaster. In 1950, the Huai River flooded, and 14 million people along the Huai River were affected. Therefore, Chairman Mao issued the call to "be sure to harness the Huai River well." The Central People's Government allocated huge amounts of grain and money under the considerable financial and economic difficulties of the country, determined to harness the Huai River. The people of all parts of the country warmly supported this project, and the people of the Huai River basin were even more jubilant than ever and threw themselves into this great construction. Three million migrant workers along the Huai River have been fighting hard on both sides of the Huai River for a year, overcoming all difficulties. The farmers went into the water to dig soil in the severe cold of minus 15 degrees Celsius, and the workers built sluice gates under the scorching sun. Full of confidence, they responded to Chairman Mao's call to build the disaster-stricken Huai River basin into a happy paradise. However, the unlawful capitalists were shooting dark arrows from behind, trying to pull the people of the Huai River basin back into deep disaster.

After the struggle against unscrupulous merchants was launched in various places, many thieves who stole the people's assets and sabotaged the Huai River project not only refused to bow their heads to the people and admit their guilt, but also tried to resist to the end in an organized manner. Sun Yingcai, the manager of Jinan Lisheng Trading Company, rushed to Bengbu when the movement started, convened a meeting of the cadres he had dragged into the water, threatened and enticed them, and organized an "alliance of offense and defense." Sun Yingcai asked Gao Shengqi, a corrupt official, to be responsible for dredging the upper and lower levels and explaining the situation; Zhao Zuyi was responsible for communications and liaison, inquiring about intelligence; Chen Jinlin was responsible for keeping the activity funds. Sun Yingcai said: "We must resolutely not confess. I am a merchant. If the case is broken, it will be solved with money. You are cadres. If the case is broken, you will go to jail." Sun Yingcai also arranged the last move: when it is really unbearable, all run away. However, the people have laid down a dragnet, and none of the thieves, including Sun Yingcai, Zhao Zuyi, and Chen Jinlin, had time to escape and were all captured. Now, the Huai River Commission has organized nine work teams to go to Shanghai, Jinan, Tianjin and other places to investigate and detect, and will definitely arrest all these thieves who stole the people's assets and seriously sabotaged the Huai River project and bring them to justice. These thieves will be severely punished by the people!

    济南上海南京等地不法资本家
    盗窃国家资财破坏治淮工程
    治淮委员会已组织工作队赴各地调查
    【新华社上海二十一日电】丧尽天良的奸商在治淮工程中大量盗骗国家资财，使关系淮河流域五千五百万人民生命财产的伟大建设遭受很大损害。奸商们在承包工程中偷工减料；出售治淮各种器材时以坏报好，以旧报新，以少报多。他们甚至派出“坐探”打入治淮组织的内部，有计划地组织贪污集团，明目张胆地盗窃资财。济南利生商行经理孙英才是这些不法资本家中的一个。去年治淮委员会向利生商行购进大批流速仪、经纬仪、马表、水平仪、水准仪、望远镜等水文和测量仪器。孙英才为了进行诈骗，首先把采购仪器的助理工程师赵祖翼、验收仪器的副工程师陈金林等拖下水，然后用大部分粗制滥造甚至不能用的旧货冒充新货卖给治淮委员会，结果获得非法利润三亿八千万元。由于这些仪器是破烂的旧货，淮河一百五十多个水文站、雨量站八个月来关于淮河及其支流的水文记录失去了应有的准确性。水文站和雨量站上数百名工人和技术人员不避风雨八个月的辛勤劳动大部分白费了。但最令人痛心的还不是人力、财力上的重大损失，而是因为水文记录不准确，使今后治淮工程的设计失去精确的依据，严重地影响了治淮工程的进行。孙英才除了谋取非法利润外，还经常盗窃治淮机关内部的器材。他去年曾为此从济南赶到蚌埠，勾引治淮委员会工程部的赵祖翼、陈金林、高声奇、朱晓白等工程人员结成一个贪污集团，由陈金林等把治淮委员会内部的绘图仪、绘图尺、皮尺、照相机等器材偷出来，再以利生商行的名义卖给治淮委员会，伙同分赃。孙英才后来索性把赵祖翼、陈金林等拉拢入股，准备在蚌埠开设利生商行的分行，买空卖空，专做治淮委员会的生意，以便更大规模地偷窃人民的资财。
    上海奸商李汉民（原是掮客）在去年一年仅仅通过一个采购器材人员，就盗窃了国家资财六亿元以上。他把三十七万元一只的千斤顶（汽车上用的）稍加油漆，另换假商标，标价一百三十五万元；他把价值二亿元的旧发电机油刷一新，冒充新货，标价二亿八千万元；他经手向慈丰车料行定购的一千辆架子车，交货时竟有七百辆是偷工减料的次货。这些器材运到工地上有的根本不能用，有的一用就坏，严重地影响了工程的进行。李汉民经手买的三轮车一共有三千三百辆，现已有一半毁坏不能使用。两部旧货冒充新货的发电机运到板桥水库工地上，时常停电，影响五万多民工不能上夜班。推土机上用的十八只缸套，大部分是坏货，因而使五部推土机停在工地上不能转动，每天耽误一万五千公方的压土工程。抽水机由于水管的接头处缺少琺瑯盘，运到白沙水库工地上无法开动，工地上的积水不能排除，以致十二万民工四、五天不能顺利进行工作，浪费了很多人力。
    河南治淮指挥部向上海第一机器造船联营所定购的四副闸门，现已查出不合规格：闸门的重量不够，闸门上的绞车少做了两个手摇轮，最重要的轴凹包着一层坏铜（应该用好铜），螺丝帽也是破旧的。价值九亿元的四副闸门就这样变成废货，不能使用。这四副闸门幸而尚未安装，假如安装上去，很可能因为闸门漏水而造成水灾。
    南京益大、竞成、泰成等九家木行把劣质的木材冒充好货卖给治淮委员会，也严重影响了治淮工程。去年春天，治淮委员会为了在夏汛之前赶修一处水闸，曾派干部赵钟秀等到南京采购木材。益大木行的负责人戴云啸等即恶毒地把赵钟秀拖下水，伙同盗窃人民的资财。在成交的六千根桩木中，本来讲定“广木”，交货时奸商们却搀杂了大批江西质料最差的武宁木；在一万英尺的洋松中也搀杂了很多发黑、开裂、坍边的旧板。奸商们认为治淮急需木材，哄抬木价，把木价提高了一倍左右，仅益大、竞成两家木行就因而获得非法利润两亿元以上。
    不法的资本家为了谋取更大的非法利润，他们派出代理人打到治淮机构的内部作为“坐探”，经常偷窃工程情报。苏北水利局的工程师谢树模就是扬州王殿记、伟达等十多家营造厂的代理人。谢树模过去曾在国民党反动政府江苏省建设厅任职，一贯和这些奸商有密切的联系。一九五零年十一月治淮工程开始，王殿记等营造厂就送钱送衣服给谢树模，要他参加治淮工作，于是谢树模便设法混进了当时淮河下游运河工程局当了副工程师，作为奸商们的内线。当时运河工程有十二个涵洞要修建，经设计后招标。谢树模先后把这些涵洞的设计和底价全部告诉了奸商，并把向上级呈报的十二个涵洞的预算也抄给了奸商，因而投标的奸商全部中了标。议价时，谢树模又故意提高价钱，使奸商获得暴利。谢树模因此得到奸商贿赂一亿元以上。奸商们在施工中毫无顾忌地偷工减料，十二个涵洞有百分之八十的材料是次料，钢筋是旧的，开闸的铣杠也不合规格，有不少涵洞刚刚完工，洞身和翼墙就都裂了缝。现在，这些工程都必须重加修理。
    不法的资本家就是这样只图私利，丧尽天良地破坏了治淮工程。淮河流域的人民过去长期处在灾难之中，一九五零年淮河泛滥，沿淮就有一千四百万人受灾，因此毛主席发出“一定要把淮河修好”的号召。中央人民政府在全国财政经济相当困难的情况下拨出了巨额的粮款，决心治好淮河。全国各地的人民热烈支援着这个工程，淮河流域的人民更是空前欢欣地投入这个伟大的建设。沿淮三百万民工在淮河两岸克服一切困难，已经艰苦地战斗了一年。农民们曾在零下十五度的酷寒中下水挖土，工人们曾在灼热的阳光下修建水闸。他们满怀信心，响应毛主席的号召，要把多灾的淮河流域建造成幸福的乐园。但是不法的资本家却在后面放暗箭，要把淮河流域的人民重新拉回深重的灾难中。
    反对奸商的斗争在各地展开后，许多偷窃人民资财、破坏治淮工程的蟊贼不仅不向人民低头认罪，反而有组织地企图顽抗到底。济南利生商行经理孙英才在运动开始时赶到蚌埠，召集被他拖下水的干部开会，威胁利诱，组织了“攻守同盟”。孙英才要贪污犯高声奇负责上下疏通，说情解释；赵祖翼负责通讯联络，打听情报；陈金林负责保管活动经费。孙英才说：“我们坚决不要坦白，我是个商人，破了案，大不了用钱，你们是干部，破了案可要坐牢。”孙英才还布置了最后一着：到实在支持不住的时候，全部逃跑。可是人民已布下了天罗地网，孙英才、赵祖翼、陈金林等蟊贼一个人也没有来得及逃跑，就全部落网了。现在，治淮委员会已组织了九个工作队分赴上海、济南、天津等地调查侦察，一定要把这些盗窃人民资财、严重破坏治淮工程的蟊贼一一逮捕归案。这些蟊贼将受到人民严厉的惩办！
