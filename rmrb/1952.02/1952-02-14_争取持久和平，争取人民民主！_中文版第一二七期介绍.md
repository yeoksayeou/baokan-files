"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition No. 127 has been published.

The editorial in this issue, entitled "The Growing Development of Agriculture in People's Democratic Countries," states: As the European People's Democratic countries enter 1952, they have already achieved significant successes in agriculture. The output of agricultural products in these countries has greatly increased, livestock breeding has also achieved significant results, and the task of paying public grain has been successfully completed. The editorial points out that the progress made by the People's Democratic countries in all aspects of agriculture is primarily due to the land reform implemented shortly after the establishment of the people's democratic system, which fundamentally changed the balance of class forces in these countries. Secondly, it is due to the valuable assistance of the Soviet Union in science and technology. At the same time, the development of the agricultural machinery industry also plays a very important role in the development of agriculture in these countries. The People's Democratic countries have established more than 1,100 state-owned machine tractor stations, and modern agricultural machinery has increasingly become a part of the daily life of farmers. The editorial also states that a characteristic of agriculture in the People's Democratic countries is the increasingly significant trend of cooperation among working farmers. From the example of Soviet collective farmers and their own experience, they have increasingly seen the enormous benefits of collective farming. In the past two or three years, the Communist and Workers' Parties have gradually put agriculture on the road to socialism by establishing production cooperatives, and have achieved great success in this regard. The average harvest of cooperative farms in all People's Democratic countries is 15 to 40 percent higher than the average harvest of individual farmers. At present, the most important task of the Communist and Workers' Parties in these countries is to further strengthen production cooperatives politically and organizationally in the countryside. It is necessary to strengthen rural party organizations in all aspects, to maximize their connection with the masses, to improve political work among the peasant masses, and to strengthen the party's leadership in the countryside.

This issue publishes an article by Apostol, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, entitled "The New Labor Attitude of the Romanian People." The author points out that in the Romanian People's Republic, due to the transfer of basic means of production into the hands of the working people, their attitude towards labor has undergone a revolutionary change. Comrade-like cooperation and socialist mutual assistance in labor have become the driving force for the development of the country along the socialist road. The new relations of production have given rise to socialist emulation. This competition has included two-thirds of the workers, technicians and staff, and has prompted many enterprises to complete their 1951 production quotas ahead of schedule. Workers and technicians have demonstrated creative initiative in the competition. They have applied the advanced production methods of Soviet Stakhanovite workers, greatly increased labor productivity, and put forward more than 3,000 innovation proposals in the first six months of last year, saving the country more than 500 million lei (Romanian currency). The author then says that in addition to the new labor attitude of the people, another new feature is developing, which is the concern of the people who are masters of their own affairs for socialist property. This feature is manifested in the struggle against waste in production, in which the broad masses of working people participate. 37,000 workers have learned from the example of advanced Soviet workers and promised to take care of their tools with a socialist attitude. The author emphasizes that at the same time, there are still serious shortcomings in the methods of organizing and leading socialist emulation. The Romanian Workers' Party is vigorously overcoming formalism and bureaucracy in the competition, supporting the initiatives of the masses, and criticizing all capitalist ideological remnants of backward workers.

This issue publishes an article by Lauter, Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, entitled "Struggle for the Progressive Culture of Germany." Lauter said that the democratization of East Germany has paved the way for the unprecedented development of German national culture. Due to the elimination of monopoly capitalist enterprises, the implementation of democratic land reform, and the establishment of a state with the working class in a decisive position, the economic dependence of cultural workers on monopoly capital has come to an end. The national undertakings stipulated in the government's decisions on cultural affairs enable cultural workers to give full play to their knowledge and abilities in developing science and art. This further consolidates the alliance between the working class and the intellectuals, and further increases the tasks of the intellectuals in the field of production and social life. Lauter then pointed out that in recent years, many important literary works, songs, and films have appeared in the cultural circles of the German Democratic Republic, but at the same time there are some extremely serious shortcomings. These shortcomings are manifested in failing to keep up with the needs of present life. One of the main reasons is that the representatives of modern German art, including the best representatives, are still influenced by bourgeois formalism, and there is a contradiction between the new content in their works and the clumsy methods of expressing this new content. Therefore, in order to overcome the stagnation in the culture of the German Democratic Republic, it is necessary to carry out a relentless struggle against formalism in all aspects of the ideological front, and to create a truly realistic art.

This issue also publishes articles such as "The Work of the Hungarian Local People's Congress" by Hazhi, member of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, and "The Bolivian People's Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism and for Peace" by Vargas.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二七期介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二七期已经出版。
    本期以“人民民主国家的农业日益发展”为题发表社论说：欧洲人民民主国家在进入一九五二年之际，已在农业方面取得了重大的成就。这些国家的农产品产量已有很大的增加，牲畜饲养业也得到了重大的成绩，在缴纳公粮方面也顺利地完成了任务。社论指出：人民民主国家所以在农业的各方面获得进展，首先是由于人民民主制度在建立后不久，就实行了土地改革，根本改变了这些国家的阶级力量的对比。其次是由于苏联在科学技术方面的宝贵援助。同时，农业机械工业的发展在这些国家的农业的发展方面也起着很重大的作用。人民民主国家已经设立了一千一百多个国营机器拖拉机站，近代的农业机器已日益成为农民每天生活中的一部分了。社论又说：人民民主国家农业的一个特点，就是劳动农民的合作趋向日益显著。他们从苏联集体农民的例子和自己的经验中，已日益看到集体耕种的巨大利益。共产党和工人党在过去两三年中，已渐渐地用建立生产合作社的方法使农业走上社会主义的道路，而且在这方面已获得了很大的成就。所有人民民主国家合作社农场的平均收获量都比个体农民的平均收获量高百分之十五到四十。目前这些国家的共产党和工人党在农村中的最重要的任务，就是在政治上和组织上进一步加强生产合作社。必须从各方面加强农村的党组织，使它们和群众取得最大限度的联系，改进对农民群众的政治工作，加强党在农村中的领导作用。
    本期刊载了罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会政治局委员阿波斯托尔的“罗马尼亚人民的新的劳动态度”一文。作者指出：在罗马尼亚人民共和国，由于基本生产资料转入劳动人民的手里，他们对劳动的态度已发生了革命性的改变。劳动中的同志般的合作和社会主义的互助，已经成为使国家沿着社会主义道路发展的动力。新的生产关系产生了社会主义竞赛。这种竞赛已经包括了三分之二的工人、技术人员和职员，并促使许多企业提前完成了一九五一年的生产定额。工人和技术人员在竞赛中发挥了创造的积极性。他们应用了苏联斯塔哈诺夫式工作者的先进生产方法，使劳动生产率大大提高，而且在去年头六个月内提出了三千多件革新建议，为国家节省了五亿多列伊（罗币）。作者接着说：除了人民的新的劳动态度之外，另一种新的特点正在发展，这就是当家作主的人民对社会主义财产的关心。这种特点表现在广大劳动人民群众所参加的反对生产中浪费现象的斗争上。有三万七千名工人学习苏联先进工人的榜样，保证要以社会主义的态度来照管他们的工具。作者强调说：但是，和这同时，在组织和领导社会主义竞赛的方法上还存在着严重的缺点。罗马尼亚工人党正在大力克服竞赛中的形式主义和官僚主义，支持群众的倡议，并对落后工人的一切资本主义思想的残余进行批评。
    本期发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会书记处书记劳特的“为德国的进步文化而斗争”一文。劳特说：东德的民主化为德意志民族文化的空前发展铺平了道路。由于肃清了垄断资本企业，实行了民主土地改革，建立了一个由工人阶级掌握决定性地位的国家，文化工作者在经济上依靠垄断资本的状况已宣告结束。政府关于文化方面的决定中所规定的国家事业，使文化工作者在发展科学和艺术方面，得以充分发挥他们的知识和能力。这就进一步巩固了工人阶级和知识分子的联盟，进一步增加了知识分子在生产领域里和社会生活中的任务。劳特接着指出：近年来德意志民主共和国文化界已出现了许多重要的文学作品、歌曲、影片，但同时也存在着一些极为严重的缺点。这些缺点表现为赶不上现在的生活的需要。其主要原因之一，就是现代德国艺术界的代表人物，包括最优秀的代表人物在内，仍然受着资产阶级形式主义的影响，他们的作品中存在着新内容和表现这个新内容的拙劣方法之间的矛盾。因此，为了克服德意志民主共和国文化上的停滞，必须对思想战线上的各方面的形式主义进行无情的斗争，创造出一种真正写实主义的艺术来。
    本期还刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员哈济的“匈牙利地方人民会议的工作”和瓦尔加斯的“玻利维亚人民为反对美帝国主义、争取和平而斗争”等文章。    （新华社）
