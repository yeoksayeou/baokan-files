Xinhua News Agency, February 4th:

    The Thai government recently conspired to escort patriotic Overseas Chinese in Thailand to Taiwan to be slaughtered by the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit group. The spokesperson of the Beijing Returned Overseas Chinese Federation issued a statement in this regard, stating:
    In December of last year, the Thai government unreasonably arrested Wu Tianrong, editor-in-chief of Quanmin Bao, staff member Shi Boxing, and Chen Huaitian, secretary of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. Recently, it even conspired to secretly escort patriotic elements among the Overseas Chinese to Taiwan to be slaughtered by the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit group. After this conspiracy was publicly exposed, Thai Interior Minister Nai Wanraok, although verbally cunning and unwilling to admit that he had issued such an order, revealed his ferocious face in his explanation. He said: "It is not yet possible to answer which city the deported Overseas Chinese will be sent to. It should depend on which city the ships will dock at." In other words, if an American ship goes directly from Thailand to Taiwan, it may be sent to Taiwan. This exposes that the Thai authorities have not abandoned their vicious conspiracy to slaughter patriotic Overseas Chinese by the hand of Chiang Kai-shek. Instead, they are shamelessly trying to deny it and shift the responsibility to the so-called destination of the ships. Thai Foreign Minister Nai Warakan even more blatantly issued a statement, verbally acknowledging that "according to international law, when deporting foreigners, they should be sent back to their place of origin." However, he used the excuse that Thailand and China have not established diplomatic relations and arrogantly claimed that they "have the right" to send patriotic Overseas Chinese to Taiwan. This reveals their vicious conspiracy even more clearly.
    We must sternly condemn the Thai government's conspiracy to slaughter patriotic Overseas Chinese and point out that the Thai government's arrogant and shameless actions are openly and directly hostile to the Chinese people, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate! The Thai government must immediately stop this sinister plan to escort patriotic Overseas Chinese to Taiwan to be slaughtered by the Chiang Kai-shek gang; otherwise, the Chinese people will have sufficient reason to settle any blood debts caused by this atrocity with the Thai government!
    The Thai government should immediately release all patriotic Overseas Chinese who have been arrested under various shameless pretexts and stop all acts of persecution against Overseas Chinese. Otherwise, it must bear full responsibility for all serious consequences.

    斥泰国阴谋解送华侨去台湾
    【新华社四日讯】最近泰国政府阴谋把泰国爱国华侨解送台湾去给蒋匪残余集团残杀。北京归国华侨联谊会发言人对此发表谈话称：
    泰国政府去年十二月间无理拘捕全民报总编辑吴天荣、职员施伯兴及中华总商会秘书陈怀天等。最近甚至阴谋将华侨中的爱国分子偷偷解送至台湾去给蒋匪残余集团残杀。这阴谋被公开揭露后，泰国内务部长乃挽若虽然口头上狡猾地不敢承认他曾下过这种命令，但在解释中却已将狰狞面目暴露无遗，他称：“要把被驱逐出境的华侨送至那一个城埠尚不能答复，应该看各该轮船要到什么城埠靠岸。”换言之，如美国轮船由泰国直放台湾，那就可能送到台湾了。这暴露泰国当局丝毫没有放弃假手于蒋介石肆行屠杀爱国华侨的凶恶阴谋，而是很无耻地图谋抵赖，想把责任推卸给所谓轮船的去向。泰国外交部长乃哇拉干就更露骨地发表谈话，在口头上承认“依据国际公法，解送外侨出境，应解回其原籍”之后，藉口泰国和我国没有建立邦交，蛮横地自称“有权”把爱国华侨解往台湾。这把他们凶恶的阴谋招供得更加显明了。
    我们必须严正谴责泰国政府这种屠杀爱国华侨的阴谋，并指出泰国政府这种蛮横无耻的行动就是公开直接与中国人民为敌，这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的！泰国政府必须立即停止这种阴险地解送爱国华侨到台湾给蒋匪帮残杀的凶恶计划；否则中国人民将有充分的理由向泰国政府清算这种暴行所造成的任何一笔血债！
    泰国政府应该立即释放在各种无耻藉口下加以拘捕的所有爱国华侨，并停止一切迫害华侨的暴行。否则它对于所有严重的后果也必须负完全的责任。
