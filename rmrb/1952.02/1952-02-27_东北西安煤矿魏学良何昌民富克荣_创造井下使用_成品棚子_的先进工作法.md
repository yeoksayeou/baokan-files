Wei Xueliang, the pit manager, He Changmin, the construction section chief, and Fu Kerong, the technician, of the Dacheng Mine No. 2 of the Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine Bureau, went deep into the field during the production increase and economy campaign. Addressing the shortcomings in the current support-setting work (not keeping up with the progress of the tunneling face, low quality, and using large materials for small purposes), they researched and created a method of using "finished supports" in tunneling roadways (making the support arches outside the pit according to the support specification drawings, and transporting them to the face [the coal mining area] for installation). Repeated modifications and trials by Dacheng Mine No. 2 have proven that using "finished supports" in tunneling roadways is superior to the original method of making supports on-site in the pit, and is a new reform in support work. It makes a significant contribution to improving efficiency, ensuring safety, and saving pit wood.

Supports are wooden frames and sheds made of wood in the excavated roadways during the coal mining production process to prevent roof falls (cave-ins, collapses, high falls) and rib spalling (the flaking off of the roadway walls). They can resist the pressure and collapse of the coal seam and ensure the safety of coal miners working underground. Therefore, the quality and progress of support setting are extremely related to coal mine production. Poor support quality will lose the function of preventing roof falls and rib spalling; if the progress of support setting cannot keep up with the speed of tunneling, it will constrain the progress of the tunneling face, thereby affecting the completion of production tasks.

The main advantages of using the advanced work method of "finished supports" are: It can increase the efficiency of support setting by more than two times. In the past, it generally took one support-setting worker six hours to complete one arch support in the pit. Now, workers make the arches outside the pit and install them in the pit. Under normal circumstances, one person can make one support in one hour and forty-five minutes. In the past, workers needed the help of support technicians to set up supports. Now that the supports are made according to specifications, ordinary workers or non-support workers can participate in support-setting work when they are underground. Due to the increased efficiency of support setting, it can keep up with the advance of the tunneling face in a timely manner, which also increases the efficiency of tunneling. Taking the No. 25 and No. 20 faces of this pit as examples, after the trial implementation of "finished supports" in October, the tunneling efficiency increased by 9 percent compared to the past.

Using "finished supports" can not only rationally use pit wood but also improve support quality. Workers make arches centrally outside the pit, according to the thickness and length of each piece of wood, and the "supports" made are suitable for the different requirements of the roadway cross-section; it avoids the waste of transporting wood into the pit and cutting it off if it is too long, which is using large materials for small purposes. After the tunneling face of No. 2 pit tried "finished supports," it can save 7 percent on pit wood consumption every month. If each mining area promotes this advanced experience, the entire Northeast coal mine can save more than 30,000 cubic meters of pit wood throughout the year. At the same time, if the appropriate pit wood materials are selected when making "finished supports," it can not only save pit wood but also increase the life of the supports. Moreover, since the lips and legs of the "finished supports" are made according to the specified specifications, the quality of the supports is greatly improved. For example, during the support inspection in August last year, among the 843 supports in the entire pit, 83 were substandard, accounting for 9.8 percent; after the trial implementation of "finished supports," among the 1,511 supports inspected in September, only 22 were substandard, accounting for 1.5 percent.

Using "finished supports" can standardize the roadway cross-section. The specifications of the supports are made according to the roadway cross-section specifications in the pit, so the on-site roadway cross-section must also be excavated according to the planned size. Otherwise, the "finished supports" will not be usable. Therefore, the use of "finished supports" promotes the standardized operation of the tunneling face and improves the specifications of the tunneling face.

However, the following points should be noted when promoting the "finished supports" work method: First, it is necessary to do a good job of preparation, carry out in-depth ideological education for employees, so that they pay attention to the specifications and quality of the project, and help overcome the difficulties in the implementation. Second, high-skilled support workers should be selected to work outside the pit to cut the arches to ensure the quality of the arch cutting. Third, a strict support quality inspection system should be established. The quality of arch cutting should be checked at the pit wood yard, and substandard arches must not be allowed to enter the pit. If substandard products are found during on-site construction, they should be reworked immediately; and prevent individual workers from re-cutting the pit wood because the excavation does not meet the specifications. Fourth, the faces that promote "finished supports" should pay special attention to complying with the excavation specifications when drilling and blasting. Conforming to the excavation specifications of the face is an important prerequisite for ensuring the promotion of "finished supports."

At present, the advanced work method of "finished supports" is only used in tunneling roadways. Whether the duckbill supports of large coal mining faces are applicable can also be tested. (Chen Gengfu)

    东北西安煤矿魏学良何昌民富克荣
    创造井下使用“成品棚子”的先进工作法
    东北西安煤矿矿务局大成矿二坑坑长魏学良、建设股长何昌民、技术员富克荣，在增产节约运动中，深入现场，针对目前架棚子工作中的缺点（跟不上掘进掌子的进度，质量低劣，大材小用），研究创造出在掘进巷道使用“成品棚子”的工作法（把棚子擎口在坑外按照棚子规格图样做好，运到掌子〔采煤的地方〕内安装）。由大成矿二坑反复修正和试行的结果，证明了在掘进巷道使用“成品棚子”优于原先在坑内现做棚子的工作方法，是支柱工作上的一项新的改革。它对提高效率、保障安全、节省坑木都有重大的贡献。
    棚子是在煤矿生产过程中，为防止冒顶（塌顶、陷落、高落）和片帮（巷道两壁片落）而用木头在掘进的巷道内做成的木架、木棚。它可以抵御煤层的压力和陷落，保障煤矿工人安全地在地下工作。因此，架棚子的质量和进度，都和煤矿生产有着极大的关系。棚子的质量不好，就会失掉防止冒顶和片帮的作用；架棚子的进度赶不上掘进的速度，就会牵制掘进掌子的进度，以致影响生产任务的完成。
    使用“成品棚子”的先进工作法的主要优点是：可使架棚子效率提高两倍多。过去，架棚子工人在坑内架一架擎口棚子，一般需要一个人用六小时才能完成。现在，工人在坑外把擎口做好，到坑内安装，一般情况，一个人用一点四十五分钟就可以做好一架棚子。过去，工人架棚子需要支柱技术工帮助，现在按规格把棚子做好了，到坑下普通工或非支柱工都可参加架棚子工作。由于架棚子效率的提高，能及时跟上掘进掌子的前进，使掘进的效率也提高了。以这个坑二十五号和二十号掌子为例，十月份试行“成品棚子”后，掘进效率较过去提高百分之九。
    使用“成品棚子”，不仅能合理使用坑木，而且提高了支柱质量。工人在坑外集中做擎口，按每根木头的粗细、长短来做，做出来的“棚子”适合巷道断面的不同要求；避免了过去把木头运到坑内，长了就截，大材小用的浪费。二坑掘进掌子试行“成品棚子”后，每月在坑木消耗上能节省百分之七。假如各矿区都推广这一先进经验，全东北煤矿全年可节省三万多立方公尺坑木。同时，制做“成品棚子”时，如果坑木材料选择的适当，不仅可以节省坑木，而且可以增加棚子的寿命。又由于“成品棚子”的唇口和腿脚角度都按规定规格做出，因而就大大提高了棚子的质量。例如去年八月份检收棚子时，全坑八百四十三架棚子，其中不合规格的就有八十三架，占百分之九点八；试行“成品棚子”后，九月检收的一千五百一十一架棚子中，只有二十二架不合规格，占百分之一点五。
    使用“成品棚子”可以使巷道断面做到正规化。棚子的规格是按坑内巷道断面规格来做的，所以现场巷道断面也必须按计划规定的尺码掘进。否则“成品棚子”就使用不上。因此，使用“成品棚子”就促进了掘进掌子的正规作业，提高了掘进掌子规格。
    但在推行“成品棚子”工作法时，应注意以下事项：首先，必须做好准备工作，向职工进行深刻的思想教育，使他们重视工程的规格质量，并帮助克服推行时的困难。其次，应选择技术高的支柱工到坑外来担任切截擎口的工作，以保证擎口切截的质量。其三，应建立严格的棚子质量检查制度。在坑木场检查擎口切截质量，不合规格的不得入坑。在现场施工时，发现不合规格的马上返工；并防止个别工人因掘进不合乎规格而将坑木再行切截的现象。其四，推行“成品棚子”的掌子，应特别注意打眼放炮时遵守掘凿规格。掌子的掘凿合乎规格是保证推行“成品棚子”的重要前提。
    目前“成品棚子”的先进工作法，还只在掘进巷道使用。采煤大掌子的鸭嘴棚子能否适用，也可以试行。    （陈耕夫）
