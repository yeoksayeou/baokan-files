　　Dihua Timber Merchants Like Liu Haitao Etc.
　　Stole National Assets Worth 5 Billion Yuan and Massively Destroyed Forests
　　Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, Burhan, Calls on All Ethnic Groups in Xinjiang to Resolutely Repel the Bourgeoisie's Savage Attack
　　Using despicable means such as bribery and threats, Dihua timber merchants like Liu Haitao colluded with Mao Xiongda, the chief of the forestry protection section of the Dihua Forestry Administration Station, and inspector Wang Fengxiang, etc., to steal national economic intelligence, evade taxes, steal and transport timber joint orders, and steal more than 5 billion yuan of national property, causing serious damage to some forests in Dihua that will be difficult to recover for a century.
　　The first step for this group of extremely sinful merchants in stealing national property was to try every possible means to bribe and buy off forestry protection staff at the Forestry Administration Station. Liu Haitao, the manager and corrupt merchant of Xishun Timber Factory, Jiang Youcai, the manager and corrupt merchant of Xiesheng Timber Factory, Hua Jiansheng, the manager and corrupt merchant of Xinghua Timber Factory, etc., used various methods to lure Mao Xiongda, the chief of the forestry protection section of the Forestry Administration Station, and inspector Wang Fengxiang, etc., pulling them over and making them agents for these corrupt merchants in the national economic organs. Then, this group of corrupt merchants conspired with embezzlers Mao Xiongda, Wang Fengxiang, etc., to steal the state's timber transport joint orders. They privately underreported the amount on the timber transport joint orders to evade huge amounts of goods tax and business tax, evading a total of about 3 billion yuan in taxes before and after. During the period of forest closure for cultivation in February 1951, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government ordered the sealing of timber that had already been felled in the forest area, and at the same time allocated 34 million yuan to relieve impoverished lumberjacks. After corrupt merchant Liu Haitao and others stole this information from the Forestry Administration Station, they accelerated the smuggling of the sealed timber on the one hand, and surrounded Mao Xiongda, the bribe-receiving official in charge of distributing relief funds, on the other hand, threatening him with "reporting" his acceptance of bribes, forcing Mao Xiongda to issue relief funds. As a result, the embezzler Mao Xiongda gave all the relief funds that should have been given to the impoverished masses to this group of corrupt merchants. The impoverished lumberjacks, under the attack of severe cold and snow, did not receive a single cent.
　　Timber merchants like Liu Haitao used these despicable and shameless means to steal a total of more than 5 billion yuan of national property.
　　The crimes of this group of corrupt merchants do not stop there. During the vigorous suppression of counter-revolutionaries in June 1951, the greedy and insatiable corrupt merchant Liu Haitao and others brazenly coerced forestry inspectors who had accepted bribes to protect them in felling large areas of mountain forests, openly plundering state property. Due to their massive felling, parts of Dihua's forests suffered serious damage that will be difficult to recover for a century. This loss is incalculable.
　　After Dihua City launched the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of national economic intelligence, this group of corrupt merchants still did not honestly confess their criminal facts and actively moved around, forming an "offensive and defensive alliance" with embezzlers like Mao Xiongda. But all the conspiracies and tricks of this group of corrupt merchants went bankrupt under the power of the masses, and their crimes were exposed one after another. People from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in Dihua City expressed unparalleled anger at the heinous crimes of these corrupt merchants, and unanimously demanded that the People's Government severely punish them.
　　Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, Burhan, said in a statement: The crimes of Dihua timber merchants who bribed, threatened, and colluded with corrupt officials of the Dihua Forestry Administration Station to steal huge amounts of national property in an organized and planned manner, seriously affecting the national economy and people's livelihood, fully demonstrate that the bourgeoisie's erosion, destruction, and plundering of the motherland, the people, and national property is not only omnipresent, but also ubiquitous. The fact that corrupt merchants like Liu Haitao stole national economic intelligence, evaded taxes, and even frantically destroyed forests and openly plundered state property is ironclad proof of the bourgeoisie's attack on the people of Xinjiang. This shows that wherever there is a bourgeoisie, there will inevitably be crimes of the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the people.
　　Burhan said: In Xinjiang, only where there is water and trees can people of all ethnic groups live and work. As everyone knows, forests are of particular importance to the survival and development of Xinjiang's 5.3 million people. In order to change Xinjiang's climate, greatly develop agriculture and animal husbandry, and embark on the road of collectivization, it is first necessary to vigorously develop forestry; at the same time, Xinjiang's modern industrial construction is advancing by leaps and bounds day by day, and more timber is needed. Therefore, the people of Xinjiang cherish every tree. The People's Government publicizes and organizes people to plant trees every spring and autumn, and has repeatedly stipulated the closure of mountains for afforestation and unified logging to benefit the people of Xinjiang's livelihood and development. The labor army under General Wang Zhen has planted about 2 million trees in the past two years to transform Xinjiang's natural conditions and improve the people's economic life. But corrupt merchants like Liu Haitao are so mad and barbarously destroying the country's precious forests, destroying the basic conditions for the survival and development of the people of Xinjiang. After the people reported these crimes of the corrupt merchants, they still refused to confess and should be punished more severely. This crime is the same in nature as the crime of merchants in Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places who harmed the Chinese People's Volunteers. This is the nature and root of the bourgeoisie.
　　Burhan said: The people of Xinjiang must immediately clearly recognize the bourgeoisie's class nature of being profit-driven and harming others to benefit themselves; clearly recognize that the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on the people does not distinguish between inland and border areas, nor between large and small cities. Corrupt merchants drill through every hole and go everywhere. The crimes of corrupt merchants like Liu Haitao in Dihua City and the various crimes of the bourgeoisie that the people in Yili, Tacheng, Kashgar, Turpan, and other places have initially exposed are ironclad examples. Anyone who ignores this fact and believes that Xinjiang is a remote place without large cities, so the bourgeoisie will not have a rampant attack, will cause irreparable losses to the great motherland.
　　Burhan concluded: The people of Xinjiang must urgently mobilize, organize forces, unite all legitimate industrialists and businessmen, and launch a deep-going movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and materials, and theft of national economic intelligence in all small and medium-sized cities in Xinjiang, and resolutely and thoroughly repel the bourgeoisie's rampant and savage attack. Only in this way can the people of Xinjiang, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and with the help of General Wang Zhen and his labor army, accept the advanced experience of the Han people, continuously accelerate and consolidate Xinjiang's economic construction, change the face of Xinjiang, and reach a happy and fulfilling tomorrow with the people of the whole country.

    迪化市木材业奸商刘海涛等
    盗窃国家资财五十亿元并大肆破坏森林
    新疆省人民政府主席鲍尔汉号召新疆各族人民坚决打退资产阶级的野蛮进攻
    迪化市木材业奸商刘海涛等使用贿赂、威胁等卑鄙手段，勾结迪化林业管理站护林股股长毛雄达和巡查王凤翔等，盗窃国家经济情报，偷漏税款，偷盗运木联单，盗窃国家财产达五十亿元以上，并使迪化的部分森林遭受到百年难以恢复的严重破坏。
    这批罪大恶极的奸商盗窃国家财产的第一步，是千方百计地贿赂和收买林业管理站护林工作人员。西顺木厂经理奸商刘海涛、协盛木厂经理奸商姜有才、兴华木厂经理奸商华建生等用了各种办法勾引林业管理站护林股长毛雄达和巡查王凤翔等，把他们拉了过去，成为这些奸商在国家经济机关中的代理人。接着，这批奸商就和贪污分子毛雄达、王凤翔等合谋偷盗国家的运木联单，他们私自在运木联单上以多填少，偷漏了巨额货物税和营业税，前后偷漏的税款共达三十亿元左右。在一九五一年二月封山育林期间，新疆省人民政府下令封存林区已经砍伐好的木料，同时拨款三千四百万元救济贫苦的伐木群众。奸商刘海涛等从林业管理站窃取了这一情报后，一面加速偷运已封存的木料，一面把负责发放救济款的受贿分子毛雄达包围起来，用“检举”他受贿的手段为要胁，迫使毛雄达发给救济款，结果，贪污分子毛雄达把应该发给贫苦群众的救济款全部送给了这批奸商。在严寒风雪侵袭下的贫苦伐木群众却一文也没有得到。
    木材业奸商刘海涛等就是用这些卑鄙无耻的手段，盗窃国家财产总数达五十亿元以上。
    这批奸商的罪行还不止此。在一九五一年六月大张旗鼓地镇压反革命分子期间，贪婪无厌的奸商刘海涛等竟胆大包天地要胁曾受贿的林区巡查人员包庇他们砍伐大片山林，公开地抢掠国家资财，由于他们大量砍伐，使迪化部分森林遭受到百年难以恢复的严重破坏。这种损失是无法计算的。
    在迪化市展开反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动后，这批奸商仍不老实坦白他们的犯罪事实，并四处活动，和贪污受贿分子毛雄达等订立“攻守同盟”。但是这批奸商的一切阴谋诡计都在群众的力量下破产了，他们的罪行纷纷被揭发出来。迪化市各族各界人民对这些奸商的滔天罪行表示无比愤怒，一致要求人民政府予以严厉惩办。
    新疆省人民政府主席鲍尔汉发表谈话说：迪化市木材业奸商贿赂、威胁、勾结迪化林业管理站的贪污分子，有组织有计划地盗窃国家巨大资财，严重地影响国计民生的罪行，充分地说明资产阶级对祖国、对人民、对国家资财的侵蚀、破坏和抢夺，不仅无孔不入，而且无地不有。奸商刘海涛等窃取国家经济情报，偷税、漏税，以至丧心病狂地大肆破坏森林，公开抢夺国家财产的事实，就是资产阶级向新疆人民进攻的铁证。这说明了凡是有资产阶级存在的地方，就一定有资产阶级向人民猖狂进攻的罪行。
    鲍尔汉说：在新疆，有水有树的地方，才是各族人民生息劳动的场所。众所周知，森林对于新疆五百三十万人民的生存和发展，有着特殊的重要意义。为了改变新疆气候，大量发展农业牧业，走上集体化道路，必须首先大力发展林业才有可能；同时，新疆现代化的工业建设，正在日新月异地突飞猛进，更需要大批木材。因此，新疆人民非常珍惜一树一木。人民政府每年春秋两季都宣传组织人民植树造林，并曾三令五申规定封山育林，统一采伐，以利新疆人民的生息和发展。王震将军所部劳动大军，为改造新疆自然条件，提高人民的经济生活，两年来千辛万苦植树两百万株左右。而奸商刘海涛等竟如此丧心病狂，野蛮地破坏国家宝贵的森林，破坏新疆人民生存发展的基本条件。奸商们这一罪行被人民检举后，还拒不坦白，应当罪上加罪，予以严惩。这一罪行，和上海、天津等地奸商暗害中国人民志愿军的罪行，从性质上说，完全一样。这就是资产阶级的本色和根性。
    鲍尔汉说：新疆人民必须立即清楚地认识资产阶级唯利是图、损人利己的阶级本质；清楚地认识资产阶级猖狂地向人民进攻，是不分内地和边疆，也不分大小城市的。奸商是见孔就钻，有地必到。迪化市奸商刘海涛等的罪行和最近伊犁、塔城、喀什、吐鲁番等地人民初步揭发出的资产阶级的种种罪行，就是铁的例证。谁如果忽视这一事实，认为新疆地方偏僻，没有大城市，因而资产阶级不会有猖狂进攻，谁就会给伟大的祖国造成不可弥补的损失。
    鲍尔汉最后说：新疆人民必须紧急动员起来，组织力量，团结一切正当的工商业者，在全新疆各中小城市，深入地展开反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的运动，坚决、彻底打退资产阶级的猖狂野蛮进攻。只有这样，新疆人民才能在毛主席、中国共产党的领导下，在王震将军和其所部劳动大军的帮助下，接受汉族人民先进经验，不断地加速与巩固新疆的经济建设，改变新疆的面貌，和全国人民一起达到幸福美满的明天。  （新华社）
