Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: The new Egyptian government, headed by Maher, under the active interference of US-British imperialism, has violated the will of the Egyptian people and openly expressed its willingness to compromise with the US-British aggression bloc.

Maher, the Egyptian Prime Minister who seized power due to direct US-British interference, immediately gave an interview to a reporter from the British *News Chronicle* on January 30th, stating that he was "willing to discuss the Middle East Command issue with the Four Powers (US, UK, France, and Turkey)." On the same day, a spokesperson for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry stated that if the West satisfies Egypt on the Sudan issue, the Egyptian government would be willing to consider joining the Middle East Defense Pact within the scope of the United Nations. A January 30th Agence France-Presse dispatch from London also stated: According to reliable sources, Egyptian King Farouk, Prime Minister Maher, and British Ambassador Stevenson have reached an agreement on resuming the Anglo-Egyptian negotiation plan. An Associated Press dispatch from London on the 3rd also revealed: British diplomatic circles believe that there is hope for Anglo-Egyptian negotiations to begin in the next few days. Observers believe that the negotiations may lead to a conference between the US, UK, France, Turkey, and Egypt to discuss the organization of a five-nation Middle East regional defense command.

    埃及新政府违反人民意志
    公然表示要和美英集团妥协
    【新华社五日讯】在美英帝国主义积极干涉之下，以马赫尔为首的埃及新政府违反埃及人民的意志，公然表示要和美英侵略集团妥协。
    由于美英直接干涉而夺得政权的埃及首相马赫尔，在登台之后，首先即在一月三十日对英国《新闻记者报》记者发表谈话，表示他“愿意和四国（美、英、法、土）讨论中东司令部问题”。同日，埃及外交部发言人表示，如果西方使埃及在苏丹问题上感到满意，埃及政府愿意考虑参加属于联合国范围内的中东防御公约问题。法新社一月三十日伦敦电讯中又说：据可靠人士消息，埃及国王法鲁克、首相马赫尔和英国大使施谛文已在恢复英埃谈判计划方面取得协议。美联社伦敦三日消息并透露：英国外交界认为英埃谈判有在最近几天内开始的希望。观察家相信谈判可能使美、英、法、土和埃及举行会议，以讨论组织一个五国中东区域防卫司令部。
