Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 4th: Our frontline reporter reports: Around the Spring Festival, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, full of confidence in victory, continued to repel multiple attacks by small groups of enemy troops on the ice- and snow-covered front lines, and annihilated many enemy troops.

On the eastern front, the American invading army, on the morning of January 22nd, with two companies of troops, under the cover of tanks and artillery fire, attacked our army's position more than ten kilometers east of Mundung-ni. Our defending troops immediately rose up to meet the enemy and bombarded them with fierce artillery fire. In this battle, our army suffered no casualties and killed or wounded more than 150 enemy soldiers. On the night of the 27th, our army, with two platoons of troops, attacked the enemy troops occupying a certain area west of Mundung-ni. After one hour of fighting, they completely annihilated a platoon of the 8th Regiment of the 7th Division of the Rhee Syngman puppet army.

On the central front, on the night of January 23rd, a certain unit of our army, with a small number of troops, counterattacked the American invading army occupying a certain high ground southeast of Kimhwa. The brave soldiers suddenly charged from all sides and annihilated a platoon of the 4th Company of the 21st Regiment of the 24th Division of the panic-stricken American invading army. On the morning of the 29th, an enemy company, under the cover of tanks, attacked our army's position southwest of Kimhwa. They were bombarded by our army's artillery fire en route, and the enemy suffered more than 50 casualties and fled in panic. At the same time, when five enemy tanks were sneaking into the Chestnut Valley area southwest of Kimhwa, four of them were destroyed by our pre-laid mines.

On the western front, on the morning of January 24th, two enemy companies attacked the Chisan-dong area west of Chorwon. A platoon of our defending troops continuously repelled two enemy charges, killing or wounding more than 50 enemy soldiers, while only one of our soldiers was wounded. Late on the night of the 27th, two companies of enemy troops stealthily attacked an unnamed high ground east of Saknyong, and were ambushed by our army en route, throwing the enemy into chaos. Our army immediately charged out and killed a large number of enemy troops on the snow-covered mountains.

While American aircraft were constantly violating the Kaesong neutral zone, the enemy army continued to attack and harass the vicinity of the Panmunjom conference area with small groups of troops, but they were all repelled by our army guarding the security of the neutral zone. On January 26th, an enemy company attacked a high ground only six kilometers northeast of Panmunjom. Our army immediately gave them a head-on blow, and the enemy army suffered more than 20 casualties before fleeing.

The American air bandits, who were constantly carrying out frantic bombing and strafing of peaceful Korean towns and villages and residents, also suffered heavy blows from our air defense forces and the People's Air Force. In the five days before the Spring Festival, our ground anti-aircraft artillery fire shot down or damaged as many as 37 enemy aircraft.

Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 4th: Our frontline reporter reports: On a mountain area on the right bank of the Imjin River, the anti-aircraft gunners of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers shot down four enemy aircraft and damaged seven enemy aircraft in three days of fighting.

At 3:00 PM on December 31st of last year, a squadron of enemy aircraft flew over the right bank of the Imjin River to carry out repeated bombing and strafing. The heroic Volunteer anti-aircraft gunners defending the position immediately used fierce artillery fire to meet the enemy aircraft. In the blink of an eye, the lead enemy aircraft was hit and caught fire, and two enemy aircraft were damaged. The other enemy aircraft scattered in a panic.

At 9:00 AM on January 2nd of this year, two enemy reconnaissance planes led ten F51 fighter planes to fly to this place again. The reconnaissance planes first swooped down on our anti-aircraft gun position. As the enemy planes flew lower, the anti-aircraft guns suddenly opened fire, shooting down and damaging one enemy plane each. The remaining enemy planes immediately scattered and fled. In a short while, the brave anti-aircraft gunners shot down another one and damaged two enemy planes attempting to attack by surprise. These two battles occurred less than 25 minutes apart.

At 11:00 AM on the 5th, two F51s, eight P47s, and one F80 enemy aircraft flew in at different speeds to engage the anti-aircraft gunners. As soon as the American air bandits swooped down, an F51 and a P47 were damaged by our anti-aircraft artillery shells. But the enemy was not willing to fail. After a while, another batch of enemy aircraft came to challenge the anti-aircraft gunners. Eight enemy planes circled halfway and then swooped down on the anti-aircraft gun position all at once. But the first anti-aircraft artillery shell accurately hit the first enemy plane. The enemy plane immediately burst into flames and fell towards the southeast, trailing a long stream of white smoke. The enemy planes following behind saw the first one catch fire, and hastily changed direction halfway through the dive, escaping to high altitude.

    朝中部队打退小股敌军多次进攻  
    春节前五天我高射炮火毁伤敌机三十七架
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】本社前线记者报道：春节前后，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军满怀着胜利的信心在冰雪封山的前线，继续打退小股敌军的多次进攻，并歼灭了许多敌军。
    在东线，美国侵略军于一月二十二日上午，以两个连的兵力，在战车和炮火掩护下向文登里以东十多公里处的我军阵地进攻。我该地守军，当即奋起迎击；并以猛烈炮火向敌轰击。在这次战斗中，我军无一伤亡，并杀伤敌军一百五十多名。二十七日夜间，我军以两个班的兵力，出击侵占文登里以西某处的敌军，战斗一个小时，全歼守敌李承晚伪军第七师第八团的一个排。
    在中线，一月二十三日夜，我军某部以少数兵力，反击侵占金城东南某高地的美国侵略军。勇士们突然从四面冲杀上去，将惊慌失措的美国侵略军第二十四师第二十一团第四连的一个排一举歼灭。二十九日晨，敌军一个连在战车掩护下向金城西南我军阵地进犯，中途遭到我军炮火轰击，敌伤亡五十多名狼狈逃去。同时，敌五辆战车在向金城西南栗洞地区窜进时，被我预设的地雷炸毁四辆。
    在西线，一月二十四日晨，敌两个连向铁原以西芝山洞地区进犯，我一个班守军，连续打退敌军两次冲锋，杀伤敌军五十多名，而自己只有一个战士负伤。二十七日深夜，两个连敌军偷袭朔宁以东一个无名高地，中途遭到我军伏击，敌顿时大乱。我军立即冲杀出来，将大批敌军击毙在积雪的山岭上。
    在美国飞机不断侵犯开城中立区的同时，敌军仍用小股兵力向板门店会场区附近进攻和窜扰，但都被保卫中立区安全的我军所击退。一月二十六日，敌军一个连向板门店东北仅六公里的一个高地进攻，我军即予迎头痛击，敌军伤亡二十多名后逃去。
    不断向朝鲜和平城乡和居民进行疯狂轰炸和扫射的美国空中强盗也遭到我防空部队和人民空军的沉重打击。在春节前五天，我地面高射炮火击落击伤敌机即达三十七架。
    【新华社朝鲜前线四日电】本社前线记者报道：在临津江右岸一个山地上，中国人民志愿军某部的高射炮手们，在三天战斗中打落了四架敌机，打伤了七架敌机。
    去年十二月三十一日下午三点钟，一队敌机飞到临津江右岸的上空，施行轮番轰炸和扫射。守卫在阵地上的英勇的志愿军高射炮手们，立即用猛烈的炮火迎击敌机。转眼间，领队的一架敌机中弹起火，并有两架敌机被击伤。其他的敌机就一哄逃散了。
    今年一月二日早晨九点钟，敌人的两架侦察机引了十架F51型战斗机又飞到这个地方。侦察机首先向我高射炮阵地俯冲。敌机飞低了，高射炮突然地开火了，一下就打落打伤了敌机各一架。其余的敌机，立刻逃散。不一会，勇敢的高射炮手们又打落了一架打伤了两架企图偷袭的敌机。这两次战斗先后相隔不满二十五分钟。
    五日中午十一点钟，两架F51型、八架P47型、一架F80型的敌机用不同的速度飞来和高射炮手们交战。美国空中强盗刚向下俯冲，一架F51型的和一架P47型的就被我高射炮弹打伤了。但敌人不甘心失败，一会儿，又来了一批敌机向高射炮手们挑战。八架敌机转了半个圈就一齐向高射炮阵地俯冲下来。但第一颗高射炮弹就准确地打中了第一架敌机。敌机顿时燃烧起来，拖着长长的一溜白烟向东南方向坠落。跟在后面的敌机看到第一架着了火，俯冲到半路就急忙变换方向，向高空逃走了。
