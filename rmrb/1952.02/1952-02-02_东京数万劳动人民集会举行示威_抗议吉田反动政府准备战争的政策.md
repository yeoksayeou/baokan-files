Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: The "Pravda" correspondent in Tokyo, Kokin, reported on the mass demonstration of the laboring people of Tokyo on January 26th: The Japanese Diet has been discussing the Japanese budget for several days now. The Japanese people call this budget a war budget. The majority of this budget is allocated for preparing for war, expanding the "police force," restoring the navy, maintaining the American occupation forces, and intensifying the terror against people with progressive ideas. The Diet is also preparing to formulate anti-labor laws to control democratic organizations and prohibit general strikes.

The Yoshida government hopes to use these laws to act even more unscrupulously, to intimidate the masses of people who are rising up to fight against the traitors and the American occupation forces. But the Japanese people are not afraid of these intimidations. Nothing can shake their determination to fight.

The basic spirit of the mass demonstration of the laboring people of Tokyo on January 26th was to express a militant protest against the Yoshida government's policy, against the war budget, and against launching new attacks on the basic rights of the laboring people.

At twelve o'clock noon, tens of thousands of laboring people—railway workers, dockworkers, urban transportation workers, construction workers, teachers, artists, employees of public and private institutions, and many others—gathered in Shiba Park. Many demonstrators held small flags and banners with slogans such as: "Down with the Yoshida Government!" "Support Peace, Oppose War!" "Down with the War Budget That Destroys Our Lives!"

Police rushed to the demonstration site in a continuous stream. American and Japanese military police glared angrily at the red flags. But the laboring people remained calm. After learning that the government had forbidden the demonstration to proceed to the Diet building, the demonstrators elected twenty representatives, charging them with submitting the resolution unanimously passed on the spot to the government.

After sending the delegation to the Diet, the demonstrators began to leave the park in an orderly formation. The long rows of red flags stretched for several streets.

One demonstrator said to his companion: "We are very powerful when we are united, aren't we?" He added: "We haven't had such a demonstration for a long time."

The Japanese people have become more closely united to fight for the freedom and independence of their country.

    东京数万劳动人民集会举行示威  
    抗议吉田反动政府准备战争的政策
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报驻东京记者科金报道一月二十六日东京劳动人民举行群众示威的情形说：日本国会讨论日本预算，到现在已经有好几天了。日本人民称这个预算为战争预算。这个预算的大部分都是拨作准备战争、扩充“警察部队”、恢复海军、维持美国占领军以及加紧对有进步思想的人民进行恐怖措施之用。国会并准备制订管制民主团体和禁止总罢工的反劳工法。
    吉田政府希望用这些法律使自己更能横行无忌，去恫吓那些正在起来向卖国贼和美国占领军斗争的人民群众。但是日本人民绝不害怕这些恫吓。任何东西都不能动摇他们斗争的决心。
    一月二十六日东京劳动人民群众示威的基本精神，就是以战斗性的抗议反对吉田政府的政策，反对战争预算，反对向劳动人民的基本权利发动新的进攻。
    在正午十二点钟的时候，有好几万劳动人民——铁道工人、码头工人、城市运输工人、建筑工人、教师、艺术工作者、公私机关的职员以及许多别的人们——集合在芝公园里。许多示威的人手里都拿着小旗和标语牌，上面写着：“打倒吉田政府！”“拥护和平，反对战争！”“打倒破坏我们生活的战争预算！”
    警察源源赶到示威的地方。美国和日本的军警对红旗瞪着愤怒的眼睛。但是劳动人民保持着镇静。在得知政府已经禁止示威队伍向国会大厦前进之后，示威群众就选出二十个代表，责成他们把当场一致通过的决议提交政府。
    派了代表团到国会以后，示威群众就开始有秩序地整队离开公园。长长的红旗的行列延长到好几条街道。
    有一个示威者对他的同伴说：“我们团结起来，力量就很强大，不是吗？”他又说：“许久以来，我们已经没有进行过这样的示威了。”
    日本人民已经更密切地团结起来，为争取他们国家的自由和独立而斗争。
