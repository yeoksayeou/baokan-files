　　Soviet Press Article Abstract

　　The Road to Economic Bankruptcy
　　The Soviet Labor Newspaper published an article by Cheprakov on February 7, pointing out that the US economic policy of military expansion will inevitably accelerate economic bankruptcy. The abstract is as follows:
　　The actual situation in the United States increasingly confirms the correctness of Marxist-Leninist economics that an increase in military production is carried out by relying on the reduction of civil industries. Although military production in the United States is expanding, its total industrial production is declining. One of the reasons for the decline in civil industrial production is the shortage of raw materials; because the main raw materials are used to supply the needs of the military industry. Another reason is the decline in the purchasing power of the broad masses of people caused by inflation and impoverishment.
　　The downward trend in the total industrial production of the United States has been showing since the middle of last year. Most of the national income is used to maintain the armed forces and engage in military production. Since the beginning of the Korean War, the number of US troops has more than doubled, and military production has tripled, which has forced its total tax revenue for the 1951 to 1952 budget year to exceed 70 billion US dollars.
　　Along with massive taxation is the unlimited rise in prices. According to official US statistics, the wholesale prices of goods in the United States at the end of last year rose by 14 percent compared with the beginning of the Korean War. But workers' wages have remained at their original levels.
　　The reduction in workers' real wages, massive unemployment, and the decline in farmers' incomes have reduced residents' purchasing power. At the same time, the foreign trade policy implemented by the US ruling class of severing economic ties with the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries has also brought serious damage to the United States itself, reducing the possibility of its commodity exports.
　　The decline in the purchasing power of the American people and the sharp decline in the export of civilian goods will inevitably lead to a crisis in American industry. The sluggish sales of civilian industrial products in the United States have confirmed this. At present, the total value of unsalable goods stored in various enterprises is more than 70 billion US dollars.
　　American newspapers are filled with news of factories reducing production and reducing weekly working days. According to the New York Times, in recent months, the production of American rayon has been reduced by half; many factories only operate three or four days a week; most of the smaller factories have been closed, and the spinning mills only utilize 50 percent of their production capacity.
　　Thus, the militarization of the economy—that is, the excessive expansion of military industries at the expense of reducing the production of daily necessities—cannot but lead to economic turmoil.
　　In order to avoid economic bankruptcy, what are the American ruling groups preparing to do?
　　On the eve of Truman's submission of his message to Congress, major differences of opinion arose within the US ruling group on issues such as further expansion of armaments and the speed of expanding armaments. Some representatives of the business community advocated allocating some metals and raw materials to industrial sectors that produce daily necessities in order to maintain their production levels. But this argument was immediately rejected by arrogant warmongers.
　　Truman's message to Congress on economic issues in fact indicated that the US ruling class still chose the path of expanding armaments.
　　In the US President's message, there is undisguised panic about the current budget deficit and the threat of inflation. This year's budget year deficit is 8 billion US dollars, and the 1952 to 1953 budget year deficit will be 14.4 billion US dollars. The continued expansion of currency—that is, the fall in the purchasing power of the US dollar—will inevitably worsen.
　　"Prosperity can be obtained through the expansion of armaments" - this was the official slogan of American propaganda in the past. Now, the heads of the United States have to publicly admit that this "theory" is bankrupt.
　　Strengthening the expansion of armaments, further reducing civilian industries, and lowering the living standards of the working people are the paths chosen by the US government. This road will not only fail to reduce the economic difficulties in the United States, but on the contrary, it will only accelerate the development of the crisis that has already appeared in the US economy.

### 走向经济破产的道路

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

　　走向经济破产的道路
    苏联劳动报二月七日登载了车普拉考夫的论文，指出美国扩张军备的经济政策，必将加速招致经济破产。摘要如下：
    美国的实际情况，越益明显地证实了马列主义经济学关于军事生产的增加是以依靠民用工业的缩减而进行的这一论据的正确。虽然美国的军事生产在扩大，但它的工业生产总量却在下降着。造成民用工业生产下落的原因之一，是原料不足；因为原料主要的用作供给军事工业的需要。另一个原因，则是通货膨胀和贫穷化所造成的广大人民的购买力的低落。
    美国工业总生产量的缩减趋势，自去年年中即已显示出来。全国国民收入的大部分都被用来作为维持武装部队和从事军事生产之用。自朝鲜战争开始以来，美国军队的人数增加了一倍多，军事生产增加了两倍，这就使它的一九五一到一九五二年的预算年度的税收总额不得不超过了七百亿美元。
    与大量课税俱来的是物价的无限制地上涨。根据美国官方的统计，去年年终美国的商品批发价格比起朝鲜战争开始时上涨了百分之十四。但是工人的工资却仍停留于原来的水平上。
    工人实际工资的降低、大量失业和农民收入的低落，已经使居民的购买力缩减了；同时，美国统治阶级所实行的对苏联以及人民民主国家断绝经济关系的对外贸易政策，也给美国本身带来了严重的损害，减少了它的商品输出的可能。
    美国人民购买力的下落与民用货物输出的锐减，不可避免地将导致美国工业的危机。美国民用工业生产品的滞销已证实了这一点。目前各企业储存的滞销货物的总值已在七百亿美元以上。
    美国的报纸上登满了各工厂缩减生产和减少每周工作日数的消息。根据《纽约时报》的报道，在近几个月以来，美国人造丝的产量减少了一半；很多工厂每周只开工三、四天；一般较小的厂多已停闭，各纺纱厂只利用了它们生产能力的百分之五十。
    这样，经济的军国主义化——即以减缩日用必需品的生产代价来过分膨胀军事工业，就不可能不招致经济的动荡不安。
    为了避免经济的破产，美国的统治集团预备怎样办呢？
    在杜鲁门向国会提出他的咨文的前夕，美国统治集团内部，对进一步扩张军备以及扩张军备的速度等问题的意见，曾发生了重大的分歧。一部分商业界代表主张分一些金属和原料给生产日用必需品的工业部门，以便维持它们的生产水平。但这种言论马上就遭到了狂妄的战争贩子们的断然拒绝。
    杜鲁门致国会的有关经济问题的咨文，事实上表明了美国统治阶级仍选择了扩张军备的道路。
    在美国总统的咨文中，显露着对于当前预算赤字和通货膨胀威胁的无可掩饰的惊惶。今年预算年度的赤字是八十亿美元，而一九五二到一九五三年的预算年度的赤字则将为一百四十四亿美元。通货的继续膨胀——即美元购买力的跌落，将无可避免地更加恶化起来。
    “通过扩张军备便可获得繁荣”——这是从前美国宣传的官方口号。现在，美国的头子们则不得不公开承认这一“理论”破产了。
    加强军备扩张，进一步缩减民用工业，降低劳动人民的生活水平，这就是美国政府所选择的道路。这条道路不仅不能减少美国的经济困难，相反，它只能加速美国经济中已经出现的危机的发展。
