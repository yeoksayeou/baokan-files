    Zheng Guangxing, deputy platoon leader of a logistics transportation platoon in a certain unit of the Northwest Military Region, has consistently maintained a hardworking and simple style since joining the revolution in 1942. After entering Xi'an, many people were unwilling to eat millet. Zheng Guangxing would say, "This is much better than living in the mountains in the past. Now we have rice and vegetables. Can it be more bitter than the past?"

    Zheng Guangxing is not susceptible to bourgeois enticements. In 1950, when he was supervising flour milling at the Yuanfeng Flour Mill, the factory wanted to deceive the troops by adding soil to the flour. However, Zheng Guangxing kept a close watch, and whenever he found the factory adulterating the flour, he would give them severe criticism. Therefore, the factory tried to drag Zheng Guangxing down. They frequently invited Zheng Guangxing to see plays and movies. However, Zheng Guangxing was very vigilant and resolutely refused. The unscrupulous merchants were not discouraged and still tried every means to pull Zheng Guangxing down. Once, Zheng Guangxing was sick, and the manager of the Yuanfeng Flour Mill took the opportunity to visit him, saying that he was suffering because he had no one to take care of him, and offered to take him to a restaurant for a meal. Zheng Guangxing refused again. Another time, the unscrupulous merchant openly said to him, "I see that you are wearing very tattered clothes. If you have any difficulties, we can help you." Saying this, he took out 50,000 yuan to give to Zheng Guangxing. Zheng Guangxing refused again. The manager then tried to stuff the money into his pocket, but Zheng Guangxing said, "I am a Communist Party member, and I don't need you to give me money!" The unscrupulous merchant still gave him the money, so he handed the money over to his superiors.

    Zheng Guangxing worked hard in his work and always thought of the public interest. In 1950, when the troops were engaged in production in the mountains, he was responsible for the storage and transportation of grain alone, cooking for the people coming and going up and down the mountain and the seven people in the transportation squad, distributing flour to the people on the mountain, and also growing vegetables for everyone to eat. But he never complained about hardship.

    Why is Zheng Guangxing able to do this? Because he always remembers that today's victory comes from hard work. Only by maintaining the glorious tradition of hard work and simplicity can we achieve greater victories.

    郑光兴打退了奸商的进攻
    张先
    郑光兴是西北军区某部后勤运输排副排长，从一九四二年参加革命以来，一贯保持着艰苦朴素的作风。进入西安以后，有很多人都不愿吃小米，郑光兴就说：“这比过去在山沟里生活好多啦，现在吃米还有菜，再苦还能有过去苦吗？”
    郑光兴是不受资产阶级引诱的。一九五○年，他在元丰面粉厂监视磨粉时，厂方想掺土面来欺哄部队，但是郑光兴看管很严，只要发觉厂方掺假时就给以严厉的批评。于是厂方设法拉郑光兴下水，经常请郑光兴看戏、看电影等。可是郑光兴警惕性很高，都坚决拒绝了。奸商还不死心，仍然千方百计地来拉郑光兴下水。有一次，郑光兴病了，元丰面粉厂经理乘机来看他，说他没人照管很苦，要请他到饭馆吃饭。郑光兴同样拒绝了。又有一次，奸商公开对他说：“我看你穿得很烂，你有什么困难，我们可以帮助你。”说着，又拿出五万元来给郑光兴。郑光兴又拒绝了。经理便硬往他口袋里塞，郑光兴说：“我是共产党员，我用不着你送钱！”奸商还是把钱给了他，他就把这钱交给了上级。
    郑光兴在工作中埋头苦干，处处为公家打算。一九五○年部队在山上生产，他一人负责保管、转运粮食，给上下山来往人员和运输班的七个人做饭，给山上的人发面，还种菜供给大家吃，但他从来没有讲过苦。
    郑光兴为什么能这样呢？因为他时时记着：今天的胜利是从艰苦中得来的，只有保持艰苦朴素的光荣传统，才能取得更大的胜利。
