Why Cotton Production Decreased in Zhujiazhuang and Gancaoying Villages Last Year

Cotton production in Zhujiazhuang and Gancaoying villages, Ci County, Hebei Province, experienced an unprecedented decrease last year. The reasons for the decrease are: failure to correctly grasp cotton planting techniques, untimely and incomplete pest control, excessive fertilization but ineffective methods, and failure to coordinate pruning and fertilization. In Zhujiazhuang, two-thirds of the cotton bolls had not opened by mid-November, resulting in a significant reduction in cotton production. In Gancaoying village, the average yield of seed cotton was only about 20 jin per mu for most cotton fields, with individual households averaging only 3 jin per mu, far from the original plan (the original plan required a yield of over 300 jin per mu).

Last year, in the patriotic production increase movement, farmers in Zhujiazhuang showed extremely high enthusiasm for production. Among the 73 cotton-growing households in the village, 58 formulated cotton production increase plans. In order to realize these plans, they actively increased fertilizer application, applying an average of 1,500 jin of manure and 50 to 130 jin of soybean cake and cottonseed cake per mu as base fertilizer. Later, they also applied 50 jin of soybean cake and 10 to 20 jin of ammonium sulfate as topdressing fertilizer in most cotton fields, which was double the amount compared to last year. At the same time, technical improvements such as seed selection, seed soaking, cotton aphid control, and pruning were carried out. Therefore, the cotton plants in the village grew very lushly during the growing season, and the bolls were large and numerous. Farmers at the time believed that the production increase plan could be realized. Unexpectedly, two-thirds of the cotton bolls had not opened by mid-November, and some households had not harvested any white cotton. The situation in Gancaoying village was similar. Based on the bumper harvest in 1950, farmers in this village increased their investment in the land even further last year. They applied an average of over 2,000 jin of manure and over 50 jin of cake fertilizer per mu, also double the amount compared to last year. At the same time, based on the traditional dense planting in this village (farmers in this village used to plant 3,000 to 5,000 plants per mu), they also carried out pruning, so cotton plants in the village generally formed bolls very early. Based on the number of cotton bolls, it was estimated that the village could harvest at least an average of 200 jin of seed cotton per mu. However, because they did not comprehensively improve technology like Qu Yaoli during the cotton growing season, excessive fertilizer application and a lack of coordination in pruning, especially the large-scale application of topdressing fertilizer in the later stage of cotton seedling growth, caused the cotton seedlings to grow vigorously in the later stage and mature very late. By November 10th (two days after the Beginning of Winter), only 30 percent of the cotton bolls had opened, while the remaining 70 percent were still green bolls and failed to open. The average yield of seed cotton was only about 20 jin per mu for most cotton fields, with individual households only harvesting 3 jin.

Why did cotton production decrease in Zhujiazhuang and Gancaoying villages?

(1) Untimely and incomplete control of cotton aphids. Cotton aphids were more severe in Zhujiazhuang this year than last year, and the period of infestation was also longer (about one and a half months). Aphids began to appear at the end of May when cotton seedlings were three to four inches tall. Although they were controlled three or four times, the control was too late and incomplete, resulting in fewer bolls in the middle and lower parts of the cotton plants and more bolls in the upper part, leading to late maturity. Although Gancaoying village carried out a large-scale pest control campaign for one and a half months, the aphids continued to occur due to incomplete eradication, and the cotton seedlings had not recovered to normal growth by mid-August. (2) Improper fertilization promoted excessive development of cotton seedlings in the later stage. After controlling cotton aphids, farmers in Zhujiazhuang, due to the large amount of base fertilizer applied, recovered quickly, but because farmers applied another topdressing fertilizer (10 to 30 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu) in most cotton fields in early August, and the cotton fields in this village were irrigated with river water, and there was also more rainfall in August, and coupled with sparse planting (1,500 to 2,500 plants per mu), it further promoted the later development of the cotton plants and delayed the maturity of the cotton. Gancaoying also generally applied ammonium sulfate as topdressing fertilizer in early August, which promoted the later growth of the cotton plants. For example, farmer Wang Zibin in this village applied a total of 40 jin of ammonium sulfate to his three mu of cotton fields, and Wang Haoxue applied 10 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu to his nine mu of cotton fields, resulting in only 27 percent of the cotton bolls opening by November 10th. At the same time, the three mu of cotton of farmer Li Chen in this village were topdressed when hoeing for the second time during the Summer Solstice (late June), and the opening rate reached 80 percent by November 10th.

(3) Failure to coordinate fertilization and pruning. The cotton in Zhujiazhuang suffered from aphids in the early stage and grew vigorously in the later stage, with many bolls. The farmers in this village always hoped to produce more fruiting branches and grow more cotton bolls, so they delayed topping until the Beginning of Autumn or even after, which made the branches and leaves in the upper part of the cotton plants luxuriant, and although many bolls were formed, they could not open in time. Farmers in Gancaoying village did not have the habit of pruning in the past. This year, some only topped the plants without thoroughly pruning the branches. For example, farmer Liu Xin's three and a half mu of cotton, in addition to applying coarse fertilizer, also applied 100 jin of soybean cake, and was also flooded by river water once in July (which was equivalent to applying fertilizer again). He lost confidence and stopped pruning, resulting in the cotton plants growing wildly. By early November, he had only picked a total of eight jin of seed cotton.

    朱家庄甘草营两村去年棉花为什么减产了
    河北省磁县朱家庄和甘草营两村去年的棉花空前减产了。减产的原因是没有正确掌握植棉技术，治虫不及时也不彻底，施肥多，但施得不得法，整枝打杈和施肥也没有配合好。朱家庄棉田到十一月中旬棉铃还有三分之二不开絮，棉花大大减产；甘草营村一般的棉田每亩平均只收籽棉二十多斤，个别户每亩平均才收三斤多，和原订计划相差很远（原计划每亩产量要求达到三百斤以上）。
    朱家庄农民去年在爱国丰产运动中，生产情绪异常高涨。全村共七十三户植棉户，就有五十八户订立了棉花丰产计划。他们为了实现这个丰产计划，都积极增施肥料，每亩棉田平均施圈粪一千五百斤和豆饼棉籽饼五十斤到一百三十斤作为基肥；以后又在大部棉田上施豆饼五十斤，硫酸錏十斤到二十斤作为追肥，基肥和追肥都比去年多一倍。同时还进行了种籽粒选、浸种、防治棉蚜及整枝打杈等技术改进工作。因此，全村的棉花在生育期间长的很茂盛，结的铃多而大，农民当时认为丰产计划一定可以实现。不料一直到十一月中旬还有三分之二的棉铃不开絮，有些户一点白花也没收。甘草营村也是这样。这村农民在一九五○年丰收的基础上，去年更增加了对土地的投资。平均每亩施圈肥约两千多斤，饼类细肥五十多斤，也比去年多一倍。同时这村农民在习惯密植的基础上（过去这村农民习惯密植每亩都在三千到五千棵左右），又加以整枝打杈，因此全村棉花很早便普遍结桃，当时根据棉桃数目推算，全村每亩棉田至少平均可收籽棉二百斤以上。但因棉花生育期间没有像曲耀离那样全面地改进技术，结果上粪多了，整枝打杈没有配合好，特别是棉苗生长后期大量施追肥，使棉苗到后期生长旺盛，很晚才成熟。到十一月十日（立冬后两天）才有百分之三十棉桃开絮，其余百分之七十棉桃依然是青桃，迟迟不开。一般的棉田每亩只收获二十多斤籽棉，个别户每亩才收到三斤。
    朱家庄和甘草营两村的棉花为什么会减产呢？
    （一）防治棉蚜不及时，也不彻底。朱家庄今年棉蚜为害较去年严重，而且为害时间也较长（约一个半月）。五月底棉苗长到三、四寸时就开始发生蚜虫，虽防治了三、四次，但因防治太晚，同时防治的也不彻底，结果棉株中下部结桃少，上部结桃多，形成晚熟。甘草营村虽然经过了一个半月大规模的治虫运动，但因除治的不彻底，蚜虫继续发生，结果到八月中旬棉苗还没有恢复到正常的生长状态。（二）施肥不得当，促使棉苗后期发育过甚。朱家庄农民除治蚜虫后，因为上基肥多，棉株恢复生长很快，但因到八月初农民又在大部棉田里上了一次追肥（每亩上十斤至三十斤硫酸錏），同时这村的棉田是河水浇地，八月间雨水又较多，水分充足，再加上是稀植（每亩一千五百株——二千五百株），因此就更促进了棉株的后期发育，延迟了棉花的成熟。甘草营也是在八月初普遍施了一次硫酸錏作追肥，促成了棉株的后期成长。如这村农民王子彬三亩棉田共施了四十斤硫酸錏，王好学九亩棉田每亩施了十斤硫酸錏，结果到十一月十日开絮的棉桃只有百分之二十七。同时这村农民李琛的三亩棉花，是在夏至节（六月下旬）锄二遍时施的追肥，到十一月十日开铃率就达到百分之八十。
    （三）施肥和整枝打杈工作没有配合好。朱家庄的棉花早期受到蚜害，后期生长旺盛，结铃很多。这村的农民总希望多出一个果枝，多长几个棉桃，以致延迟到立秋甚至立秋以后才开始摘心，这样就使棉株上部枝叶繁茂，结铃虽多不能及时开絮。甘草营村的农民过去没有整枝打杈的习惯，今年有的光是打顶，打杈就不彻底。如农民刘心的三亩半棉花，除施粗肥外，还施了一百斤豆饼，七月间又被河水溢过一次（也等于上一次肥），这样他就失去了信心，停止整枝打杈，结果棉株狂长，到十一月上旬，总共只摘了八斤籽棉。
