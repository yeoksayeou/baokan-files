    Leadership of the Casting Workshop of Hunan Machinery Factory
    Should Thoroughly Correct the Phenomenon of Rework and Scrap

    Editor Comrades: The phenomenon of rework and scrap is very serious in the casting workshop of the Hunan Machinery Factory. In just four months, from September to December 1951, there were 291 pieces of scrap, wasting 15 tons of iron, with a total loss of 120 million yuan. The reason why the casting workshop produced so much scrap is mainly because the factory's leading cadres have a bureaucratic style. For example, some workers still have conservative views. They say: "Sand casting is like gambling. Once it's covered, it's up to fate. No one is sure." The work of each production team is not interconnected. Before the furnace is started, the team leaders rarely plan the order of pouring iron together. When the furnace is started, each production team rushes to pour iron so they can go to rest earlier. In this way, slag and coal ash are brought into the product, affecting the product quality, and scrap is produced. However, some leading cadres of this factory have adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards this phenomenon. For example, the responsible cadre of the production section has never gone down to check the cause of the scrap, let alone study ways to improve it. The two workshop directors turned a blind eye to this matter and did not mobilize the masses to find ways to remedy it. In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the leadership has not yet come up with practical ways to improve the rework and scrap problem. Since January alone, more than 10 million yuan has been lost again.

### 湖南机械厂铸工场领导方面  应彻底纠正返工废活现象

    湖南机械厂铸工场领导方面
    应彻底纠正返工废活现象
    编辑同志：湖南机械厂铸工场的返工废活现象很严重，只一九五一年九月到十二月四个月中，就出现了二百九十一件废活，浪费的铁达十五吨，共损失一亿二千万元。铸工场所以产生了许多废活，主要是因为厂的领导干部有官僚主义作风。比如：有些工人还有保守观点，他们说：“翻砂如赌博，盖下去就听天由命，谁也没有把握。”各生产班的工作互不连结，开炉之先，各班长也很少一起计划浇铁水的次序；当开炉时，各生产班就抢着浇铁水，以便早去休息。这样，铁渣、煤渣被带进活里，影响了产品质量，就产生了废品。但是，这个厂的某些领导干部对这种现象采取了官僚主义的态度。如生产课负责干部从来没有下去检查过产生废活的原因，更谈不上研究改进的办法。两个工场主任对这件事也熟视无睹，不发动群众想法补救。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，领导方面还没有想出切实改进返工废活的办法，只一月份以来，就又损失了一千多万元。  刘城淮
