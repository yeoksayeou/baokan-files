Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 18th—Washington dispatch: Since U.S. President Truman submitted a huge budget of $85.4 billion to Congress in January, opposition to this budget within the U.S. ruling group has been increasing. More and more congressmen, fearing that the government's unrestrained spending will bring greater disaster to the U.S. economy, have been demanding cuts in U.S. domestic and foreign spending.

The U.S. budget issue has become one of the central points of contention within the U.S. ruling group. A United Press Washington dispatch on January 31 stated: "The heated debate over U.S. government domestic and foreign expenses will be a major event in American politics during this presidential election year." United Press had previously revealed that "most of the major Democratic and Republican members of Congress generally demanded budget cuts rather than increased taxes." In a radio discussion on January 27, several important Republican and Democratic congressmen raised objections. Republican Senate Leader Bridges attacked the current government's spending policy, saying it "is on the road to destroying the American economy." Republican Senator Dirksen advocated cutting $7 to $8 billion from the budget. Democratic Senator Douglas criticized the waste of American taxpayers' money on American military equipment, saying that if Congress passes Truman's budget, the United States will face a huge deficit of $15 billion, which will cause "extremely bad" inflation. He demanded a $7.5 billion reduction from the total budget. U.S. Senate Banking and Currency Committee Chairman Maybank recently also called for a $7 to $10 billion reduction from the budget in a radio address. Even Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a pillar of Truman's foreign policy, issued a statement on February 1, advocating "substantial reductions" in Truman's budget, worriedly saying: "Passing the president's budget will only make inflation uncontrollable and cause economic chaos."

Many congressmen, when criticizing Truman's budget, openly demanded cuts or even cancellation of U.S. "aid" appropriations to support the arms expansion and war preparations of Western European vassal states. They believe that when the U.S. economic situation is very tense and U.S. financial resources are stretched, the U.S. should not waste money propping up the extremely weak Western European vassal states. Republican Congressman Bennett said in a radio discussion on February 3 that "the United States should reduce its obligations to the West." He added: "The United States cannot endure the seemingly endless drain that the aid policy imposes on its economy," and he believes that the United States "is implementing a suicide plan." Republican Senator Saltonstall and Democratic Senator Allen also unanimously advocated cutting U.S. foreign "aid" appropriations in a radio discussion. They fiercely attacked Western European vassal states for their poor war preparations, believing that "European countries are not sharing the burden of defense." Senate Banking and Currency Committee Chairman Maybank issued a statement on the 4th, demanding a reduction of 30% to 50% in the foreign "aid" funds in the budget, believing that "the American economy cannot bear the burden of assisting countries around the world." On the same day, Republican Congressman John Wood introduced a bill in Congress calling for the cancellation of all U.S. foreign "aid" appropriations.

The fierce dispute within the U.S. ruling group in this regard has already affected the Truman government's consistent policy of arming Western Europe in preparation for war. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Richards stated on February 8 that if the U.S.'s vassal states in the North Atlantic Alliance cannot resolve their contradictions and their arms expansion and war preparation work continues to be delayed, "the U.S. Congress may greatly reduce foreign aid programs." However, if the U.S. does so, then the entire North Atlantic aggressive bloc can only further disintegrate. Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th dispatch, said that the Truman government is currently actually in a "dilemma": if the U.S. formally threatens Western European vassal states with the cessation of "aid," "the United States will become an unappreciated big power interfering in the internal affairs of its allies"; if the U.S. stops "aid" without notifying Western Europe, it will "lead to the total collapse of the (North Atlantic Group) common policy." Agence France-Presse believes that under such circumstances, "the entire American foreign policy will encounter serious danger."

    杜鲁门提出庞大预算后
    美统治集团争吵激烈
    许多国会议员害怕招致经济灾难纷纷要求削减预算和美“援”拨款
    【新华社十八日讯】华盛顿消息：自从美国总统杜鲁门在一月间向国会提出八百五十四亿美元的庞大预算以来，美国统治集团内部对这个预算的反对正在增强。越来越多的国会议员们因为害怕政府漫无节制的开支会给美国经济带来更大的灾难，纷纷要求削减美国的国内外开支。
    美国预算的问题，目前已成为美国统治集团内部争吵的中心之一。合众社华盛顿一月三十一日电说：“对美国政府国内外费用的热烈争辩，将是本届总统选举年美国政治上的主要大事。”合众社前此已透露，“国会中大部分主要的民主党议员和共和党议员都普遍要求削减预算而不要再增加赋税。”在一月二十七日的广播讨论中，共和党和民主党的若干重要议员都提出了反对意见。参议院共和党领袖勃里奇攻击现政府的花钱政策“已经走上毁坏美国经济的道路”。共和党参议员德克森主张从预算中削减七十到八十亿美元。民主党参议员道格拉斯批评美国军事设备浪费美国纳税人的钱，他说：如果国会通过杜鲁门预算，美国就要面临一百五十亿美元的巨大赤字，这将引起“极其恶劣”的通货膨胀。他要求从总预算中削减七十五亿美元。美国参议院银行与通货委员会主席梅班克最近也在广播演说中要求从预算中削减七十到一百亿美元。甚至杜鲁门政府外交政策的支柱、参议院外交委员会主席康纳利也在二月一日发表声明，主张“大量削减”杜鲁门预算，他耽心地说：“通过总统的预算案，只有使通货膨胀一发不可收拾，引起经济的混乱。”
    许多议员在对于杜鲁门预算提出责难的时候，公开要求削减甚至取消支持西欧附庸国家扩军备战的美“援”拨款。他们认为在美国经济局势十分紧张、美国财力自顾不暇的时候，美国不应该空耗金钱去扶植孱弱已极的西欧附庸国家。共和党众议员贝奈特二月三日在广播讨论中认为“美国应削减它对西方的义务”。他又说：“美国不能忍受援助政策所加于它的经济上的这种显然无穷无尽的消耗”，他认为美国“是在执行着自杀计划”。共和党参议员沙赖斯脱尔和民主党参议员艾伦大在广播讨论中也一致主张削减美国的“援”外拨款。他们猛烈攻击西欧附庸国家备战不力，认为“欧洲国家没有分担防务的负担”。参议院银行与通货委员会主席梅班克四日发表声明，要求把预算中的“援”外款项削减百分之三十到五十，他认为“美国的经济对于援助世界各国的工作不胜其负担”。同一天，共和党众议员约翰·伍德在国会提出法案，要求取消美国所有的“援”外拨款。
    美国统治集团内部在这一方面的激烈争吵，已经对杜鲁门政府一贯执行的武装西欧以准备战争的政策发生了影响。众议院外交委员会主席李查兹已于二月八日表示，如果北大西洋联盟中美国的各附庸国家无法解决它们之间的矛盾、它们的扩军备战工作继续拖延的话，“美国国会可能大大削减援外计划”。但是，如果美国这样做，那末，整个北大西洋侵略集团就只能进一步分崩离析。法新社华盛顿十二日电说，杜鲁门政府目前实际上已陷于“进退两难之境”：如果美国正式地以停止“援助”来威胁西欧附庸国家，“美国就会成为一个干涉盟国内政的不被领情的大国”，如果美国不通知西欧迳行停止“援助”，那就会“招致（北大西洋集团）共同政策的总崩溃”。法新社认为，在这种情况下，“整个美国外交政策就要遭遇严重的危险”。
