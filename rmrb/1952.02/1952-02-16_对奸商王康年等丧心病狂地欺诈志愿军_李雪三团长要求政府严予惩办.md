    Regarding the Heinous Fraud of Volunteer Army by Profiteer Wang Kangnian and Others
    Regiment Commander Li Xuesan Demands Severe Punishment from the Government
    [By Our Newspaper] The China People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation and the Korean People's Delegation to China, East China Branch, held a press conference in Shanghai on the 12th. Li Xuesan, the head of the China People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, explained the tasks of the delegation and introduced the current situation of the Korean War and the Volunteer Army's campaign to conserve resources. He then expressed great anger at the heinous acts of profiteer Wang Kangnian, who embezzled huge sums of money from the Volunteer Army's procurement of medicines for speculation, selling inferior and fake medicines as good ones to the Volunteer Army (for details of profiteer Wang Kangnian's embezzlement, see page 2 of today's newspaper), and profiteers Zhang Xingen and Xu Miaoxin, who mixed large quantities of bad meat, rotten meat, and horse meat into good beef when purchasing canned beef to support the front lines, selling it to the Yimin Company of the East China Industrial Department to be made into canned goods and sent to the Volunteer Army, thus seriously affecting the health recovery of the Volunteer Army's wounded and sick and the nutrition of the soldiers. He demanded that the People's Government severely punish these illegal merchants according to the law.
    Regiment Commander Li Xuesan said: Our Volunteer Army risks their lives and fights arduously on the front lines. Every time we see the support from the people of our motherland, we are sincerely grateful. During the most intense battles, the soldiers were filled with gratitude when they saw the canned goods shipped from the motherland to the front lines. Sometimes, after eating the meat in the cans, many people had diarrhea, which affected their combat effectiveness. At first, we suspected that perhaps our industrial technology was not advanced enough, but now we know that it was the profiteers who were playing tricks. He also said: When the Volunteer Army was injured or sick, sometimes many effective medicines suddenly had no effect at all. Some soldiers complained about the medical staff's misdiagnosis, and the medical staff were also confused. There were even cases of soldiers sacrificing when they shouldn't have, and becoming disabled when they shouldn't have. Now we have also found the criminals who caused these painful events. He said: If the news of exposing these profiteers' crimes reaches the Korean front lines, every soldier will be extremely angry and demand that these profiteers be severely punished.
    Regiment Commander Li Xuesan finally said: In order to strengthen the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, all commanders and fighters of our Volunteer Army have unanimously recognized the importance of the struggle against corruption and bribery. In order not to disappoint the support of the people of our motherland, we must learn from the experience of this great struggle of the people of our motherland; at the same time, we demand that the government severely punish the national scum – illegal merchants – according to the law.
    Hong Chun-chol, the head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, also specifically introduced the situation of the Korean people overcoming difficulties and increasing production and practicing economy during the war.

    对奸商王康年等丧心病狂地欺诈志愿军
    李雪三团长要求政府严予惩办
    【本报讯】中国人民志愿军归国代表团和朝鲜人民访华代表团华东分团于十二日在上海市举行记者招待会，中国人民志愿军归国代表团团长李雪三在会上说明志愿军归国代表团的任务和介绍朝鲜战争目前的形势以及志愿军开展节约运动的情况后，对奸商王康年盗骗志愿军采买药品的巨款用来进行投机活动，以劣药、假药充好药卖给志愿军（关于奸商王康年的盗骗罪行见今日本报第二版），以及奸商张新根、徐苗新在代购支援前线的罐头牛肉中，以大批坏肉、臭肉和马肉等混充好牛肉售给华东工业部益民公司做成罐头送给志愿军，因而严重地影响了志愿军伤病员的健康恢复和战士的营养等丧心病狂的行为，表示极大的愤怒。他要求人民政府对这些不法商人依法严惩。
    李雪三团长说：我们志愿军在前线出死入生，艰苦作战，每看到祖国人民给我们的支援，我们都是由衷地感谢。在战斗最激烈的时候，战士们看到从祖国运到前线的罐头，都是怀着感激的心情的。有时候，吃了罐头中的肉以后，不少人都拉肚子，影响了战斗力量。起初我们还怀疑也许是我们的工业技术不高明，现在才知道原来是奸商搞的鬼。他又说：志愿军受伤患病了，有时，许多有效药忽然一点效也没有了，战士们有的埋怨医务员诊疗错误，医务员也莫名其妙。甚至发生了战士不该牺牲而牺牲，不该残废而残废了的事。现在我们也找到了造成这种痛心事件的罪犯。他说：揭发这些奸商罪行的消息，如果传到朝鲜前线，每一个战士都会气愤透顶，要求严办这些奸商的。
    李雪三团长最后说：为了加强抗美援朝的力量，我们志愿军全体指战员已一致认识了反贪污、反行贿斗争的重要。为了不辜负祖国人民给我们的支援，我们一定要学习祖国人民的这一伟大斗争的经验；同时我们要求政府对国家的败类——不法商人依法予以严惩。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团团长洪淳哲也在会上特别介绍了朝鲜人民在战争中克服困难和增产节约的情形。
