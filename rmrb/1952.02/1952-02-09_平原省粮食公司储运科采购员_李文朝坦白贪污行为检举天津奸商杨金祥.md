To the Editor: I am a procurement officer in the Storage and Transportation Section of the Pingyuan Province Grain Company. In December 1951, I went to the privately-owned China Fire Equipment Factory on Siping Road in Tianjin to buy fire equipment. After I explained to the factory owner that I wanted to buy a large quantity of fire equipment, the manager, Yang Jinxiang, immediately offered me cigarettes and tea, and repeatedly said, "Our products are better than those of other factories, guaranteed to last for five years." Two days later, I went to the factory to inspect the goods, and Yang prepared two meat dishes and treated me to a meal. I asked him, "What is the status of the goods?" He replied, "Don't worry, Comrade Li! This is our first transaction, I guarantee to treat you and your superiors fairly." He also offered me a 2% kickback. My own will was not firm, and my position was not stable. In the face of the honeyed words and diligent hospitality of the capitalist Yang Jinxiang, I was hit by his sugar-coated bullets, and I accepted the 6 million yuan kickback he gave me. I bought seven Pacific brand fire engines, one hundred hand-cranked pumps, three hundred and fifty feet of water hose, and one hundred and five fire extinguishers from this factory. Because I accepted the kickbacks and bribes from the capitalist Yang Jinxiang, it caused the country to lose over 20 million yuan in assets. In this movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, after education from the Party and comrades, I recognized my crimes of embezzlement. Now, in addition to exposing the crimes of the capitalists Yang Jinxiang and Wang Jiading for bribing cadres and stealing state assets, I am also conducting a thorough self-examination to distinguish the boundaries between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in my thinking, to atone for my crimes to the people, and to hand over all embezzled funds to the government.

    平原省粮食公司储运科采购员
    李文朝坦白贪污行为检举天津奸商杨金祥
    编辑同志：我是平省省粮食公司储运科采购员。一九五一年十二月，我到天津四平道私营中国消防厂买消防器材。我向这个厂的资方说明要买大批消防器材后，经理杨金祥马上就拿烟提茶来招待我，并口口声声说：“我们的东西比别家厂的好，保险用五年。”隔了两天，我到这个厂去看货，杨就弄了两个肉盘，请我吃饭。我问他“货的情形怎样？”他回答：“放心吧，李同志！第一次买卖，保证对得起你和你的上级。”并说给我百分之二的回扣。我自己的意志不坚定，立场没有站稳，在奸商杨金祥的甜言蜜语、殷勤招待中，就被他的糖衣炮弹打中了，我接受了他给我的六百万元的回扣。我在这个厂先后买了七辆太平洋牌消防车，一百个手摇机，三百五十尺水龙带，一百零五个灭火机，因接受了奸商杨金祥的回扣、贿赂，致使国家资财损失了二千多万元。在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，经过党和同志们对我的教育，我认识了我的贪污罪行。现在我除了检举奸商杨金祥、王家顶贿赂干部、盗窃国家资财的罪行外，并作深入的检查，在思想上分清无产阶级与资产阶级的界限，向人民立功赎罪，并把全部贪污的款项交给政府。  李文朝
