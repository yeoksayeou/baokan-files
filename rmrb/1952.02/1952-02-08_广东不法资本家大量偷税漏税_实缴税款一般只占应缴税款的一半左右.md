In Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City, unscrupulous industrialists and businessmen are engaged in extremely serious tax evasion and underreporting. According to incomplete statistics from Guangdong's liberation until July 1951 alone, industrialists and businessmen in various parts of Guangdong concealed over 1,500 billion yuan in business revenue. According to typical surveys of industrial and commercial taxes in various regions, the actual tax payments of industrialists and businessmen generally only account for about 50% of the taxes they should be liable for, and in some cases, even only 20%. According to preliminary statistics from the Guangzhou Municipal Taxation Bureau, more than 35,800 cases of violations were discovered within two years.

Unscrupulous industrialists and businessmen employ a variety of methods to carry out the heinous activities of tax evasion and underreporting: (1) Creating false accounts; underreporting business income and overreporting expenses. In order to cope with the tax cadres' inspection of accounts, they set up two or more sets of books to conceal the true business volume, in order to achieve the aim of paying less business tax and income tax. For example, a shop in Anbu, Chao'an, engaged in the food and beverage business, initially reported a business volume of only 2 million yuan. After inspection, it was found that the business volume was concealed by as much as 100 times (200 million yuan). An import and export business in Shiqi Town, Zhongshan County, concealed 16 billion yuan in business volume. A business in Jiangmen retained three sets of accounts: one set of RMB false accounts, one set of base accounts, and one set of Hong Kong dollar accounts. The base accounts and Hong Kong dollar accounts combined were only part of the true accounts, and small books were used to record the purchase and sale of private goods. Only when combined, it could be considered a complete set of true accounts. Some unscrupulous merchants in Guangzhou City issue invoices and enter them into the books at 50% of the value of the goods, whether wholesale or retail. (2) Peddlers and shopkeepers collude to evade temporary business tax: Peddlers transport goods into the city, and shopkeepers treat them as their own purchases to evade the temporary business tax. For example, a cloth business in Shantou City sheltered peddlers with a business volume of more than 1.5 billion yuan in 1950 and 1951, evading more than 70 million yuan in temporary business tax; or they directly issue invoices to purchasing merchants to conceal the trading behavior of peddlers, in order to evade temporary business tax. This method is currently the most common. (3) Embezzling state tax revenue and transferring it as funds: Some firms try to conceal and embezzle the temporary business tax that has been withheld, fail to remit it to the treasury on time, and transfer it as funds to earn illegal profits. (4) Secretly manufacturing goods to evade taxes and seize illegal profits: A store in Shiqi Town, Zhongshan County, was found to be privately distilling rice wine, building secret rooms in the store in a planned and organized manner, setting up newer-style wine distilling tools, and regularly equipping sentry posts upstairs to understand the movements of tax bureau inspectors. They privately distilled a total of 35,942 catties of rice wine, evading a total of 83,385,600 yuan in goods tax, industrial and commercial tax, and stamp tax. (5) Forging tax bureau inspection certificates: A butcher in Jiangmen used radishes and sweet potatoes to forge slaughter tax inspection stamps, which were stamped on privately slaughtered pig skins to evade slaughter tax. (6) Some unscrupulous manufacturers evade taxes by underreporting the goods leaving the factory (when there are no tax personnel stationed in the factory) or smuggling goods out of the factory (when there are tax personnel stationed in the factory). There are also various ways to evade goods tax, such as reporting the value of taxable goods higher than they are, reporting wholesale prices as low, creating counterfeit goods, using fake inspection certificates to obscure the actual output of goods, and evading local taxes. The brewing industry in Guangzhou City once collectively evaded more than 30 billion yuan in taxes; the income tax evasion in the cultural and educational supplies industry in the first half of 1951 accounted for 197% of the amount due. (7) Using various methods to paralyze, seduce, and corrupt tax cadres to achieve the purpose of tax evasion. These unscrupulous industrialists and businessmen often evade huge amounts of state taxes with a small amount of bribes. A tax official in Guangzhou City once accepted a bribe of 1.1 million yuan, causing the state to lose more than 100 million yuan in tax revenue.

In addition, unscrupulous merchants also use illegal means such as smuggling, illegal exchange, violating customs supervision regulations, and undermining foreign trade laws, causing great losses to state property.

According to the materials possessed by Guangzhou Customs, some unscrupulous merchants not only steal state property through illegal smuggling activities, but even privately transport strategic materials to help the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism. Zeng Qitao, a traitorous merchant from Dechang Customs Brokerage (formerly Minjie Customs Brokerage) in Guangzhou City, instigated his assistant Jiang Hong to bribe Liang Dehui, director of the Huangsha Railway Station Customs Office, and inspector Zhong Lunsheng, etc., in August and September 1950, and smuggled more than 270,000 kilograms of tin (one of the strategic materials prohibited from export). Last year, customs personnel seized 317 smuggled watches and 108 watchbands in the safe and specially made concealed stool in the watch department of Jinlong Department Store in Guangzhou City. Wanguo Department Store in Guangzhou City purchased 868 smuggled watches and sold 698 watches within one year from August 1950 to July 1951. In terms of illegal exchange, some unscrupulous merchants steal state foreign exchange by smuggling exports, underreporting the value of goods, and falsely reporting the names of goods. Guangzhou Customs once seized a batch of grain on a ship operated by a certain firm that regularly engages in international trade, which was intended to be smuggled for export and avoid exchange settlement. Violations of customs supervision regulations and undermining foreign trade laws are even more common. According to incomplete statistics from May to November last year, there were 44 such cases. Most of these unscrupulous merchants overreport the quantity when applying for the transfer and export of taxed goods imported from abroad, and import goods prohibited from import without a license. If you want to transfer taxed goods imported from abroad in batches after they are released, they must be consistent with the original reported quantity, specifications, etc.; however, some commercial firms replace them with other goods after all the taxed goods imported from abroad have been transferred, in an attempt to evade customs duties. Guangzhou City's Zhongxin Firm, Xinhua Firm, Renkang Pharmacy, and Jinmei Pharmacy, etc., have engaged in similar behaviors more than five times.

In order to strictly implement government decrees and protect the property of the state and the people, Guangzhou Customs has taken or is taking measures to deal with the above-mentioned unscrupulous merchants according to the extent of their confession and the severity of their crimes, in accordance with the principle of combining education and punishment. Those unscrupulous merchants who refuse to admit their mistakes and stubbornly resist will be severely punished.

    广东不法资本家大量偷税漏税
    实缴税款一般只占应缴税款的一半左右
    广东省和广州市的不法工商业者，偷漏国家税款的情况十分严重。仅据自广东解放后到一九五一年七月的不完全统计，广东各地工商业主瞒报营业额共达一万五千亿元以上。据各地工商业税典型调查结果，工商业者实缴税款一般只占应负税款的百分之五十左右，有的甚至只有百分之二十。据广州市税务局初步统计，两年内查获的违章案件就有三万五千八百多件。
    不法工商业者采用各种各样的方法进行偷税漏税的罪恶活动：（一）造假账；少记营业收入，多记开支。为了应付税务工作干部查账，设置两套或两套以上的账簿，隐瞒真实营业额，以达到少纳营业税及所得税的企图。如潮安庵埠一家经营饮食品的商号，起初自报营业额仅为二百万元，经检查，发现瞒报营业额高达一百倍（二亿元）。中山县石岐镇某进出口业商号瞒报营业额达一百六十亿元。江门有一家商号，保留了三套账：一套人民币假账，一套基数账，一套港币账。基数账和港币账合一才是真账的一部分，另外再用小簿记载进销私货。合并起来才算一套完全的真账。广州市有些不法商人，不论批发或零售货物，都以五成货额开立发票和登入账簿。（二）行商与座商互相包庇，偷漏临时商业税：行商运货入市，座商作为自己进货以逃避临时商业税，如汕头市一家布业商号一九五零年及一九五一年共包庇行商营业额共十五亿多元，偷漏临时商业税在七千万元以上；或者直接开发票给进货商，掩蔽行商的交易行为，借以逃漏临时商业税。目前这种方式最为普遍。（三）侵吞国家税款，移作资金：有些行栈把代扣的临时商业税款，设法隐瞒侵吞，不按时解库，并移作资金，赚取非法利润。（四）秘密制造商品，逃漏税款，攫取非法利润：中山县石岐镇查获一家商店私蒸米酒，有计划有组织地在店内建造密室，设置较新式的蒸酒工具，并经常在楼上配备监视哨，了解税局检查人员动向。他们共计私蒸米酒三万五千九百四十二斤，逃漏货物税、工商业税、印花税等共八千三百三十八万五千六百元。（五）伪造税局查验印证：江门一家屠宰商用萝卜和蕃薯伪造屠宰税查验印，盖在私猪皮上，偷漏屠宰税款。（六）有些不法厂商以少报出厂货物（没有税务人员驻厂时），或私运货物出厂（有税务人员驻厂时）的办法偷漏税款。也还有把纳税货品以高报低、低报批发价、造冒牌货、用假查验证，蒙蔽关于货品实际产量等方法，及偷漏地方税等各种各样的办法来偷漏货物税。广州市的酿酒业曾集体逃税三百亿元以上；文教用品工业在一九五一年上半年逃漏所得税占应交额百分之一九七。（七）用各种方法麻痹、引诱、腐化税务工作干部，达到偷税的目的。这些不法工商业者，常以少数贿赂而偷漏国家巨额税款。广州市税务人员一次受贿一百一十万元，就使国家税款损失一亿多元。
    此外，不法商人还利用走私，逃汇，违犯海关监管章则和破坏对外贸易法令等非法手段，使国家财产遭受很大的损失。
    根据广州海关所掌握的材料，有些不法商人不但以走私的非法行为偷窃国家财产，甚至私运战略物资帮助国民党反动派和美帝国主义。广州市德昌报关行（原敏捷报关行）奸商曾其滔在一九五○年八、九月间，唆使助手江洪，向黄沙车站海关办事处主任梁德辉及验货员钟伦生等数人进行贿赂，前后偷运锡（禁止出口的战略物资之一）二十七万公斤以上出口。去年海关工作人员在广州市金龙百货公司钟表部的保险箱和特制的藏私坐凳内查获走私手表三百一十七只，表带一百零八条。广州市万国百货公司在一九五○年八月到一九五一年七月一年内就先后买进走私手表八百六十八只，卖出六百九十八只。在逃汇方面，一些不法商人用偷渡出口、低报货价及伪报货名等方式盗偷国家外汇。广州市海关曾在某行代理的经常经营国际贸易的一条船上查出一批图谋偷运出口、逃避结汇的粮食。违犯海关监管章则和破坏对外贸易法令的情形更为普遍。根据去年五月到十一月的不完全统计，这种案件便有四十四件。这些不法商人多半是在申请国外输入已税货物分运转口时超报数量和无许可证而运入禁止进口的货物。国外输入已税货物放行后，如果想分批转运，一定要和原报数量、规格等相符；但是有些商行却在国外输入已税货物全部转运完毕后，又用其他货物顶替，企图偷漏关税。广州市忠信行、新华行、仁康药房、金美药房等类此行为，都超过五次以上。
    广州海关为了严格执行政府法令，保护国家和人民的财产，对于上述的不法商人已经或正在根据他们坦白的程度和罪行的轻重，依照教育与惩办相结合的方针，分别进行处理。对于不肯承认错误、顽抗到底的不法奸商，坚决从严惩办。
