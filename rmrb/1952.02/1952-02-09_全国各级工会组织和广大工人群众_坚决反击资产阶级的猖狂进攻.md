(Xinhua News Agency, 7th) According to the Beijing Worker's Daily, in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the broad masses of workers have revealed serious facts about the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack on the working class over the past three years. To achieve their goals of cruelly exploiting workers and seeking exorbitant profits, the bourgeoisie, in addition to their frenzied attacks on the state organs led by the working class, openly and secretly attacked the working class's own organization—the trade union—directly. Especially in the serious struggle of the people across the country against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, because workers and shop assistants know best the ugly crimes of illegal capitalists, they are even more hostile to workers and hostile to trade unions, and more frantically attack trade union organizations and the broad masses of workers and shop assistants. Their main methods of attacking trade unions are:

	I. Dispatch and Control
	Some illegal capitalists organized their puppet trade unions in the early days of liberation in an attempt to pass off fish eyes as pearls; or they dispatched their cronies and henchmen to infiltrate trade union organizations in an attempt to control and utilize the trade unions. For example, in the early days of liberation, the capitalist of Shanghai Zhiwei Pharmaceutical Factory used his trusted senior staff to privately organize a puppet trade union and made false reports to the higher-level trade union, saying: "The trade union of our factory has been formally established, and labor-capital relations are very good." Later, this trick was exposed. The higher-level trade union led the workers of the factory to establish a real trade union. The capitalist superficially admitted his mistake, claiming that he "did not understand the trade union charter," but secretly threatened activists, saying: "If you organize a trade union, be careful of dying in the hands of the Thirty-Six Gang (gangsters)!" Sun Zhifei, a capitalist of Shanghai Huashang Electric Company, gave high salaries to the scabs of the Kuomintang yellow trade union after liberation and asked them to form the first "trade union" of the company. When this group of lackeys was driven away by the workers, Sun Zhifei appointed a certain employee, who was his confidant, to pretend to be progressive and infiltrate the trade union, and often stole the union's records for him.

	II. Bribery and Enticement
	When the workers' own trade union organizations were established under the leadership of the Communist Party, the capitalists changed their methods of attack and adopted bribery to pull over some wavering trade union cadres and turn them into the capitalists' lackeys. Bi Mingqi, a capitalist of Tianjin Xinmin Chemical Factory, spent more than 20 million yuan in August 1950 to help the factory's trade union chairman, Pu Yanming, get married, and provided Pu with a building, water, and electricity free of charge, while at the same time telling the workers: "Look how rich your trade union chairman is, how comfortable his life is!" Lu Shaoyou, a capitalist of Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory, repeatedly sent people to give Xie Dongsheng money when Xie, the chairman of the factory's trade union, went to the Tianjin Cadre School of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to study, using his opportunity to study in another place to bribe him. Ge Ziqi, a capitalist of Shanghai Zhonghua Weaving Factory, used the method of secretly subsidizing the base salary of 20 yuan per month to bribe the factory's trade union chairman and 15 other people. Li Xucheng, a capitalist of Shanghai Jiuyi Silk Reeling Factory, used a secret subsidy of 50 discounted units per month to bribe the factory's trade union chairman. When Shanghai Huasheng Electric Factory wanted to illegally dismiss workers, the capitalist invited 14 trade union cadres to dinner, using flowery words and pretending to be poor and miserable, and even let his wife and daughter come forward to complain. Finally, he took out 14 stacks of 5 million yuan banknotes and placed them on the table, saying: "This is a small token of my appreciation; as long as you can persuade the workers not to make a big fuss, there will be more benefits in the future." This phenomenon of bribing and enticing trade union cadres is very common.

	III.打击陷害 (Strikes and Frame-ups)
	When illegal capitalists' methods of bribery and enticement are ineffective against trade union cadres and activists, they fabricate rumors and look for any opportunity to sabotage trade union organizations by striking and framing trade union cadres and activists. Zhou Weiying, a capitalist of Tianjin Zhengzhong Rubber Factory, bribed Cui Fengxiang, a trade union cadre of the factory, six times, but was rejected, so he fabricated rumors that Cui Fengxiang had an affair with the wife of a certain counter-revolutionary element, in order to strike at Cui Fengxiang. A certain department store capitalist in Tianjin, fearing that the shop assistants would report his tax evasion, sent his first wife to lure an activist, saying: "The manager is not at home tonight, come and sit at my house!" When the first attempt at seduction failed, he sent his concubine the next day to seduce her, inviting the shop assistant to dance, and making all kinds of obscene gestures. Because the shop assistant stood firm and did not fall for it, the capitalist shamelessly slandered the shop assistant for raping his wife. Fan Hongchang, the capitalist of Shanghai Changxing Motor Vehicle Company, wanted to adopt his son to Zhou Guangjie, a trade union cadre, in an attempt to buy Zhou as a confidant. After being rejected by Zhou, he became angry and when Zhou was elected as a trade union district representative, the capitalist asked his family to tear up the trade union's congratulatory note and spread rumors, saying: "Zhou Guangjie is responsible for all the company's tax evasion, how can he be a representative!" After Liu Xin, an employee of Shanghai Parker Company, reported the company's tax evasion, the capitalist held a grudge and deliberately transferred Liu Xin to be a cashier, and then coerced two trainees to falsely accuse Liu Xin of "theft," and fabricated sixteen charges, demanding dismissal, but failed. Then he fabricated anonymous letters and sent them to the company, and then took them to report to the Labor Bureau, saying: "The workers are colluding with secret agents to disrupt public order." Min Zhaolin, the boss of Yufeng Cotton Cloth Store in Xiasha Town, Nanhui County, Southern Jiangsu, even strangled the apprentice who reported him to death. Illegal capitalists take a hostile attitude towards Communist Party members and Youth League members among the workers. When the Mao Textile Factory and Linen Textile Factory of Tianjin Dongya Enterprise Company were merged in 1950, Song Feiqing, a capitalist, deliberately concentrated Party and League members to work in one car. When the Mao Textile Factory resumed work, only the masses were transferred back, and Party and League members were not allowed to be transferred back, so that Party and League members could not contact the masses and were isolated. According to the company's old regulations, pregnant female workers should be transferred from the most arduous flax workshop, but Li Peizhen, a party member, was seven months pregnant, but the capitalist transferred her to the flax workshop to undertake arduous work.

	IV. Divisiveness and Unity
	When illegal capitalists are unable to use dispatch, bribery, and strikes to destroy trade union organizations, they use divisiveness to undermine the unity of the working class and sow discord between workers and trade unions as an important means of attacking the working class. The capitalists of Xi'an Dahua Yarn Factory deliberately issued a year-end bonus of more than 300 million yuan to senior and middle-level employees, asking them to keep it secret, but at the same time leaked the news to the workers, making the relationship between employees in the factory very bad. Liu Jicheng and Liu Jihan, capitalists of Shanghai Tianzhang Paper Mill, usually refused all reasonable demands made by the trade union on behalf of the workers, but readily agreed to the demands made by the foreman on behalf of the workers, and told the workers: "It is better to obey the foreman than to obey the trade union." Xiang Meiying, the capitalist of Huacheng Canvas Factory, deliberately divided the original workers and more than 200 workers introduced by the labor service agency into two factions, increasing the wages and benefits of the original workers, and lowering the wages of the newly arrived workers. The capitalist said: "New and old workers cannot be treated the same." Creating division among new and old workers. When the Zhiwei Pharmaceutical Factory trade union applied to the Shanghai Grain Company for two dou of rice per person, the capitalist added three dou to the workers who did not participate in the trade union, creating different treatment for workers who participated in the trade union and those who did not. Many illegal capitalists use the vicious method of "buying off a few and exploiting the majority" to divide the unity of the workers, so as to facilitate their oppression and exploitation.

	V. Restriction of Activities
	Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the policy of the People's Government to protect trade unions, capitalists cannot openly destroy trade union organizations, so they use various despicable methods to restrict workers from participating in trade union activities. In order to restrict workers from participating in trade union activities in their spare time, the capitalists of several large raincoat factories in Shanghai deliberately extended working hours to 14 hours a day, making workers too tired to participate in various trade union activities. The capitalists also told the workers: "You can earn money by working overtime, but you don't get money for trade union meetings and learning." This situation is even more common in many private shops. The capitalists in the textile industry in Harbin organized a struggle against "red skins" (trade union membership cards) to threaten workers to join the union. More than 40 factory shops capitalists in the weaving industry in Shaoyang City, Hunan Province, also used collective shutdowns to prevent workers from participating in trade union activities. There are countless examples of illegal capitalists in various places threatening workers with closures and shutdowns to withdraw from the trade union, or reducing the treatment of workers who join the trade union in order to undermine trade union activities.

	VI. Cruel Exploitation
	When illegal capitalists' aforementioned methods are ineffective in seeking exorbitant profits, they use the means that they have always used before liberation, cruelly exploiting workers, or using base means such as closing factories, closing shops, illegally dismissing workers, and withdrawing funds to threaten workers and resist the People's Government. For example, the capitalist of Shanghai Hualun Cigarette Factory has been deducting workers' wages for a long time, amounting to more than 100 million yuan. When workers asked for their wages to be paid, the capitalist threatened the workers with a work stoppage, saying: "Do it if you want to, or get out!" The shop assistants in Wuhan City demanded to adjust unreasonable wages, and the capitalists in the industry shamelessly spread rumors and threatened them, saying: "Korea is about to be defeated by the United States, why adjust wages? Today is yours, tomorrow is mine!" The workers of Wuhan's private Fuhua Clothing Factory work 17 hours a day and often work overtime all night. Pregnant female workers often miscarry in the workshop due to overwork. Yang Jichun, a mechanic, worked while vomiting blood, but the capitalist did not allow him to go home to take medicine, and said: "Take the medicine tomorrow, work is important, you are far from dying." The capitalist of the factory locked the factory door and did not allow female workers to breastfeed their children. As a result, Hu Zhiquan's child, a female worker waiting to be fed outside the door, was frozen and starved to death. The phenomenon of beating and scolding apprentices in private enterprises in various places is also extremely serious. According to the extremely incomplete statistics of the Labor Department of the East China Military and Political Committee in the third quarter of 1951, there were 168 serious cases of beating, scolding, and abusing apprentices. The case of the small boss of Hangzhou Tiandetang Pharmacy kicking an apprentice to death is one example. The contract signed by a barber shop in Jinan for recruiting apprentices even stipulates that "if a car or horse kills them, they will be left to their fate; if they make a mistake, they can be beaten to death without question."

	VII. Deception and Anesthesia
	The capitalist of Tianjin Dalai Timber Company, fearing that workers would report tax evasion, gave each worker a bonus of 12 months. Temporary workers were also given 5 million yuan per person. When Xinxing Steel Factory was processing for the state, it cut corners and produced inferior products. Fearing that the workers would expose the facts, the capitalist told the workers: "This cannot be regarded as cutting corners, this is the profit we deserve. If the profit we deserve is also considered cutting corners, our employees' year-end double salary will be impossible." The phenomenon of capitalists deceiving workers by absorbing shares is also very serious. Forty percent of the shop assistants in private shops in Wuhan City are forced to buy shares. The capitalist of Meichang Silk and Cloth Store in Nanchang City even forced shop assistants, apprentices, and cooks to buy 500,000 yuan of shares per person as a condition of employment, in order to blur the workers' class consciousness and facilitate their illegal activities.

	VIII. Misinterpretation of Policies
	Illegal capitalists in cities across the country universally misinterpret labor-capital consultation meetings, saying: "Labor-capital consultation meetings are for mediating disputes, and there is no need for consultation if there is no dispute." Therefore, when the enterprise is in difficulty, the capitalists actively establish consultation meetings in order to reduce workers' wages and benefits. However, when the difficulties are over, production improves, and the capitalist obtains high profits, the capitalist is afraid that the workers will propose to restore wages and improve benefits, so he universally avoids convening consultation meetings. For example, after the industry and commerce improved, whenever the trade union and workers asked him to convene a labor-capital consultation meeting to solve the problems raised by the workers, he pretended to call the government leader. He told the workers: "I am really busy these two days, Mayor Chen and Director Ma want me to attend a meeting, we will talk about it later." In this way, he refused to negotiate with the workers, so that the problem could not be solved for half a year.

	IX. Violation of Laws and Regulations
	Illegal capitalists universally intentionally violate the obligations stipulated for them in national laws and regulations. For example, after the promulgation of the Trade Union Law, capitalists in various places universally owe, delay, and resist paying trade union dues. According to statistics at the end of 1950, only 83 of the 579 textile factories in Shanghai paid trade union dues. Only one-quarter of the 2,400 hardware factories paid. A certain capitalist in Guangzhou slandered the payment of trade union dues as paying worker tax. Many capitalists also used various methods to resist the laws and regulations related to temporary workers promulgated in various places. The China Cement Factory in Nanjing has more than 100 temporary workers, some of whom have been working for more than ten years. The capitalist took advantage of the loophole and said: "The Trade Union Law does not stipulate the employment and dismissal of temporary workers, I can freely dismiss them." Shanghai Dafeng Chemical Factory suspends work for 20 days every two or three months to deprive temporary workers of the right to be promoted to long-term workers. Wuhan Zhengda Cloth Store hired temporary workers, and the capitalist unilaterally signed a contract stipulating: "Temporary workers have a one-month term, and whether to dismiss them after the term expires is determined by the capitalist; temporary workers are of a friendly help nature and must not participate in any groups; temporary workers do not have holidays on National Day. Those who obey will be hired, and those who do not obey will be dismissed." This is how unscrupulous and unreasonable the capitalists are.

	X. Sowing Discord
	The bourgeoisie is afraid that workers will believe in their government. In addition to misinterpreting the government's policies and violating the government's laws and regulations, they use the method of sowing discord to undermine the relationship between workers and the People's Government.

	The capitalist of Chongqing Private Zhicheng Cigarette Factory, on the one hand, instructed his lackeys to instigate and lead employees to petition the government to demand tax cuts; on the other hand, he asked the government to dismiss workers, claiming that the Labor Bureau had agreed that he "can dismiss workers," which aroused the workers' dissatisfaction with the government. Hua Wenqu, the capitalist of Guizhou Dacheng Coal Mine, deliberately withheld workers' wages for a long time, saying that the People's Bank forced him to repay debts, so he had no money to pay wages, and asked employees to complain to the People's Bank. The capitalists of many department stores in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and Wuhan told the shop assistants: The democratic government's taxes are heavy, and in the future, the government will collect taxes until it goes bankrupt, and you will not even get severance pay. This is how they create dissatisfaction with the government among the shop assistants. Many illegal capitalists have consistently stolen state property through tax evasion, cutting corners, etc. After being reported by employees, not only did they honestly confess their crimes and pay taxes, but they threatened the employees, saying: "If you report me, if I pay the taxes, the factory will close down." Or they say: "Your treatment will be reduced." After the employees reported the tax evasion of the capitalists of Shanghai Wanguo, Shanghai, Daxing and other three refrigerator material stores, they actually united and established an "anti-attack alliance," unanimously claiming that business was difficult and refusing to pay employees' wages and year-end bonuses.

Now, trade union organizations at all levels across the country, and the broad masses of workers and shop assistants across the country, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, are resolutely standing on the working class position and launching a merciless counterattack against the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack on the working class, thoroughly exposing, reporting, and accusing the various crimes of illegal capitalists. Trade union organizations at all levels across the country, under the unified leadership of the local Party committees, are further organizing all employees, especially calling on the masses of employees in private enterprises to quickly mobilize, unite as one, and resolutely struggle to defeat the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack!

    全国各级工会组织和广大工人群众
    坚决反击资产阶级的猖狂进攻
    【新华社七日讯】据北京工人日报载：在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，广大的工人群众纷纷揭发了资产阶级三年来向工人阶级猖狂进攻的严重事实。资产阶级为了达到他们残酷剥削工人、谋取暴利的目的，除掉向工人阶级领导的国家机关猖狂进攻外，并公开地和隐蔽地直接向工人阶级群众自己的组织——工会进攻。特别在全国人民反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的严重斗争中，因为工人、店员最知道不法资本家的丑恶罪行，他们就更加敌视工人，敌视工会，更加疯狂地向工会组织和广大的工人、店员群众进攻，他们向工会进攻的主要方式是：
    一、派遣控制
    有些不法的资本家在解放初期组织他们的御用工会，企图鱼目混珠；或派遣其亲信、爪牙，打入工会组织，企图控制和利用工会。如上海志卫药厂资方在解放初期，曾利用其亲信的高级职员，私行组织御用工会，并向上级工会造假报告说：“我厂工会已正式成立，劳资团结很好。”后来，这一诡计被揭穿，上级工会领导该厂工人成立真正的工会，资方表面上承认错误，推称“不懂得工会章程”，暗中却威胁积极分子说：“你如组织工会，当心死在三十六股党（流氓）手里！”上海华商电器公司资本家孙志飞，解放后给过去国民党黄色工会的工贼大加工资，叫他们组成了该公司第一届“工会”。当这群走狗被工人群众撵跑后，孙志飞又指派其亲信某职员伪装进步，打入工会，经常为其偷窃工会的记录。
    二、收买利诱
    当工人自己的工会组织在共产党的领导下建立起来以后，资本家们就改变了他们的进攻方式，采用收买的办法，把某些意志不坚定的工会干部拉过去，成为资本家的走狗。天津新民化学厂资本家毕鸣岐。在一九五○年八月，拿出二千余万元为该厂工会主席濮燕明娶老婆，并无代价地供给濮楼房、水电，一方面却又向工人说：“看你们工会主席多阔绰，生活多舒服！”石家庄大兴纱厂资本家鲁绍猷，当该厂工会主席谢动声到全国总工会天津干部学校学习时，屡次派人给谢送钱，利用他在外地学习的机会进行收买。上海中华织造厂资方戈子祺，用每月暗贴底薪二十元的方法，收买该厂工会主席等十六人。上海九一缫丝厂资本家李旭成，用每月五十个折实单位的暗贴收买该厂工会主席。上海华生电器厂要非法解雇工人，资本家就请十四个工会干部吃饭，花言巧语、装穷叫苦说了一顿，并让自己的老婆、女儿也出面诉苦。最后拿出十四叠五百万元的钞票放在桌子上说：“这是兄弟的一点小意思；只要你们说通工人，不要大闹，以后还有好处。”这种收买利诱工会干部的现象很普遍。
    三、打击陷害
    不法资本家对工会干部及积极分子用收买利诱的办法无效时，就胡造谣言和寻找一切机会，用打击陷害工会干部和积极分子的办法来破坏工会组织。天津震中橡胶厂资本家周维英向该厂工会干部崔凤祥行贿六次，都被拒绝，就造谣说崔凤祥和某反革命分子的老婆通奸，以此来打击崔凤祥。天津某百货店资方怕店员检举他的漏税行为，曾派他的大老婆引诱积极分子说：“掌柜的今晚不在家，到我家坐坐吧！”第一次引诱失败，第二天又派他的小老婆去勾引，约这位店员去跳舞，还作出各种下流举动。由于这位店员立场坚定，没有上当，这个资本家竟无耻地诬蔑店员奸淫他的老婆。上海昌兴车行资方范鸿昌要把自己的儿子过继给工会干部周光杰，企图收买周为亲信，被周拒绝后就恼羞成怒，当周当选工会区代表时，资方要他家属撕毁工会报喜单，并造谣说：“公司逃税漏税全是周光杰干的，哪配当代表！”上海派克公司资方的逃税行为被职员刘新检举后，资方就怀恨在心，故意调任刘新为出纳员，随即胁迫两个练习生诬告刘新有“偷窃”行为，并捏造罪状十六条，要求解雇，未成，又捏造匿名信寄到公司，然后拿去报告劳动局说：“工人勾结特务，扰乱治安。”苏南南汇县下沙镇裕丰棉布商店老板闵照林，竟将检举他的学徒活活勒死。不法资本家对工人中的共产党员和青年团员采取仇视态度。天津东亚企业公司资方宋斐卿在一九五○年毛纺厂、麻纺厂合并时，故意把党团员集中在一个车上工作，毛纺厂复工时，只将群众调回，党团员不准调回，使党团员不能联系群众，陷于孤立。按照该公司旧有规定，女工怀孕时期，应从工作最繁重的麻布车间调出，而党员李佩真怀孕七月，资本家却把她调进麻布车间担任繁重工作。
    四、分化团结
    不法资本家无法用派遣、收买和打击的手段来破坏工会组织时，就用分化工人阶级的团结、挑拨工人和工会的关系作为他们向工人阶级进攻的重要手段。西安大华纱厂资方故意发给高、中级职员年奖三亿多元，要他们保守秘密，但同时又把这一消息走漏出去，让工人知道，使厂内职工关系很不好。上海天章造纸厂资方刘季诚、刘季涵，平时对工会代表工人提出的合理要求一概拒绝，而对车间领班假意代表工人提出的要求就满口答应照办，对工人说：“服从领班比服从工会好。”华成帆布厂资方项美瀛，故意把原来的工人和劳动介绍所介绍来的二百多工人分成两派，提高原来工人的工资待遇，对新来的工人压低工资，资方说：“新老工人不能一样看待。”造成新老工人中的分裂。志卫药厂工会向上海粮食公司申请配米每人二斗时，资方对不参加工会的工人另加三斗，造成参加工会的与不参加工会的工人不同待遇。许多不法资本家就是用“收买少数、剥削多数”的毒辣手段来分化工人群众的团结，以便于他的压榨剥削。
    五、限制活动
    在共产党的领导和人民政府保护工会的政策之下，资本家无法公开破坏工会组织，就用种种卑劣的办法，限制工人参加工会的活动。上海几家大的雨衣厂资方为限制工人参加业余时间的工会活动，故意每天延长工时到十四小时，使工人过度疲劳，不能参加工会的各种活动，资方还对工人说：“加班可赚钱，工会开会、学习没有钱。”这种情形，在许多私营商店中更是普遍。哈尔滨市纺织业资方竟组织反“红皮子”（工会会员证）斗争，来威胁工人入会。湖南邵阳市织布业四十余家厂店资本家还用集体停业方式来阻止工人参加工会活动。各地不法资本家用关门、停业威胁工人退出工会，或对加入工会的工人降低待遇以破坏工会活动的事例，更举不胜举。
    六、残酷剥削
    不法资本家为了谋取暴利，当采用上述各种办法无效时，就用解放前一贯采用的手段，残酷地剥削工人，或者以关厂、关店、非法解雇、抽走资金等卑贱手段来威胁工人，对抗人民政府。如上海华伦烟厂资方长期克扣工人工资达一亿多元，当工人要求发给工资时，资方即用停工威胁工人，并说：“愿做就做，不做就滚！”武汉市店员要求调整不合理的工资，该业资本家竟无耻地造谣威胁说：“朝鲜快让美国打完了，还调整什么工资，今天是你的，明天是我的！”武汉市私营福华被服厂工人每日工作十七小时，经常通宵加班，怀孕女工常因劳动过度在车间流产。车工杨季春一面吐血一面做工，资方不让回家吃药，还说：“药等明天再吃吧，干活要紧，离死远着哪。”该厂资方把厂门加锁，不让女工给小孩喂奶。结果，在门外待哺的女工胡芝全的孩子竟活活被冻饿致死。各地私营企业中打骂学徒的现象也严重到极点，据华东军政委员会劳动部一九五一年三季的极不完全的统计，严重的打骂虐待学徒案就有一百六十八件。杭州天德堂药店小老板踢死学徒案就是一个例子。济南一家理发店招收学徒所订的契约中，更规定“车马碰死，听天由命，若犯错误，打死勿论。”
    七、欺骗麻醉
    天津大来木行的资本家怕工人检举漏税行为，每个工人发给十二个月的奖金。临时工每人也给五百万元。新兴钢厂替国家加工时曾偷工减料，粗制滥造，资本家怕工人暴露事实，就对工人说：“咱们这不能算偷工减料，这是应得的利润。如果应得的利润也算偷工减料，咱们职工的年终双薪就没办法了。”资本家用吸收入股的方法欺骗工人的现象，也十分严重。武汉市百分之四十的私营商店店员都被迫入股。南昌市美昌绸布店资本家更强迫店员、学徒、厨工每人入股五十万元作为雇用条件，借以模糊工人的阶级意识，以便进行他们的非法活动。
    八、曲解政策
    全国各城市的不法资本家普遍地曲解劳资协商会议，说：“劳资协商会议是为了调解纠纷的，无争议就不要协商了。”因此当企业困难时，资本家为了要工人减低工资，降低待遇，就积极成立协商会议。但当困难度过，生产好转，资方获得了高额利润以后，资本家害怕工人提出恢复工资，提高待遇，就普遍躲避召开协商会议。如上海扬子江拖驳公司资方蒉延芳，在工商业好转之后，每当工会和工人要他开劳资协商会议解决工人所提出的问题时，他就假装给政府首长打电话。并对工人说：“这两天真忙，陈市长、马局长要找我开会，有事以后再谈。”这样来拒绝和工人协商，以致半年开不成会，使问题拖着不能解决。
    九、违反法令
    不法资本家普遍地有意违反国家法令中对他们所规定的义务。如工会法颁布后，各地资本家普遍欠交、拖交、抗交工会经费。根据一九五零年年底统计，上海五百七十九家纺织厂的资方，交工会经费的只有八十三家。五金业二千四百家中，只有四分之一交费。广州某资本家诬蔑交工会经费为交工人税。对各地颁布的有关临时工人的法令，许多资本家也用各种办法进行抵抗。南京中国水泥厂有一百多个临时工，其中有十年以上的，资方钻空子说：“工会法对临时工的雇用与解雇没有规定，我可以自由解雇。”上海大丰化工厂，每隔两三个月停工二十天，以剥夺临时工升长工的权利。武汉正大布店雇用临时工，资本家单方面订立契约规定：“临时工一月一期，期满解雇与否由资方决定；临时工为友谊帮助性质，不得参加任何团体；临时工国庆日概不放假。服从者即用，不服从者解雇。”资本家就是这样的目无法纪，横蛮无理。
    十、挑拨离间
    资产阶级害怕工人相信自己的政府，除掉曲解政府的政策，违反政府的法令以外，就用挑拨离间的方法，破坏工人与人民政府的关系。
    重庆私营至诚烟厂资方，一面指使其爪牙鼓动和带领职工向政府请愿要求减税；一面又向政府要求解雇工人，扬言劳动局答应他“可以解雇工人”，引起了工人对政府的不满。贵州大城煤矿资方华问渠，故意长期扣压工人工资，说是人民银行迫他还债，所以没钱发薪，要职工到人民银行去诉苦。上海、天津、北京、武汉许多百货商店的资本家对店员说：民主政府税收重，将来叫政府收税收倒了，你们连遣散费都拿不到了。这样来制造店员对政府的不满。许多不法资本家一贯用偷税、偷工减料等方法盗窃国家财产，被职工检举后，不但不老实坦白认罪、补税，反而威胁职工说：“你们检举我，如果补了税，工厂就要关门。”或者说：“你们的待遇就会减低。”上海万国、上海、大兴等三个冰箱材料行的资本家有漏税行为，被职工检举后，居然联合起来，订立了“反攻同盟”，一致藉口营业困难，不给职工发工资和年奖。
    现在，全国各级工会组织，全国广大的工人和店员群众，正在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，坚决地站在工人阶级立场，对资产阶级向工人阶级的猖狂进攻进行无情的反击，彻底地揭露、检举和控诉不法资本家的种种罪行。全国各级工会组织，正在当地党委的统一领导下，进一步组织全体职工，特别是号召私营企业中的职工群众，迅速动员起来，团结一致，为打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻而坚决斗争！
