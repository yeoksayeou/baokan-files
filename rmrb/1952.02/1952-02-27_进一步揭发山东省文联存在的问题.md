To the Editor: We believe that the matters exposed in the letter "Should Thoroughly Inspect the Work of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles" published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on February 11th are completely consistent with the facts. We would like to add some supplementary information here.

First, for the past two years, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has never systematically organized literary and art workers to study Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art and engage in literary creation, nor has it organized literary and art workers to go deep into reality to participate in mass struggles. There is no criticism and self-criticism within the organization. A few responsible cadres are often busy with "treating guests" and "entertaining," almost "feasting every morning and singing every night." In the summer of 1951, they bought a large amount of fruits, pastries, cigarettes, and tea to "see off" Li Weidong, the director of the Provincial Department of Culture, chartered a boat to tour Daming Lake, and drank and made merry at Lixia Pavilion. This not only wasted state resources but also had a very bad impact on the masses. Since Yu Jiyu, the former deputy director of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, took office more than a year ago, he often stayed up late at night, inviting artists to his dormitory to perform operas and chat idly, getting up only at noon or in the afternoon every day. He personally liked raising fish and used public funds to build fish ponds, and a civil servant was specifically assigned to Daming Lake to collect worms for the fish. However, he rarely seriously studied and paid attention to the work and cadre situation of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

Second, the phenomenon of setting up positions based on individuals and overstaffing is also very serious within the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Some cadres' spouses have not worked for a long time but still hire nannies; some cadres even hire two nannies without doing any work. The Federation of Literary and Art Circles euphemistically calls this "taking care of cadres." Many cadres with formal jobs have unclear work assignments. As a result, a leading agency for literary and art work has become a reception center for nannies, idlers, and superfluous staff, where uprightness cannot be promoted, and unhealthy tendencies are rampant.

Third, since the publication of "Shandong Literature and Art," leading cadres have been completely unaware of the circulation figures and revenue figures of each issue. More seriously, due to a long-term lack of study of Mao Zedong's thought on literature and art, petty-bourgeois and bourgeois ideas have grown daily. Since the launch of "Shandong Literature and Art," errors have been rife. The Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, as the leading agency of "Shandong Literature and Art," has not valued and paid attention to the correct criticisms raised by the broad masses of readers, allowing it to spread the poison of erroneous ideas among the masses.

Fourth, Deng Shoulou, the former deputy manager of the Daguan Cinema, was originally a奸商 [profiteering merchant]. When Weixian was liberated in 1948, he infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. When the preparatory committee of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles was established, Deng Shoulou was transferred to the Daguan Cinema, which was managed by the Federation of Literary and Art Circles. The leadership of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles also appointed him as the director of the business department, and in October 1951, during the reorganization, he was promoted to deputy manager. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, it was discovered that he had serious corruption crimes. However, during his suspension for self-reflection, due to the bureaucracy of the leadership, he absconded out of fear of punishment and has not been arrested to date. This also illustrates the errors in the cadre policy of the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles.

Fifth, Liu Zhixia, the secretary-general of the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, has a bad style and is dishonest. In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, from the beginning to the present, his self-reflection has always been "toothpaste-like." For example, in his first self-reflection, he only made a very superficial review of the well-known issues of extravagance and waste. It was not until the Federation of Literary and Art Circles sent someone to investigate the "Imperial Palace" photo studio, which had close ties with Liu Zhixia, that it was discovered that Liu Zhixia had free photo development and entertainment at this photo studio and had accepted bribes. After everyone exposed it, he mentioned it in his second self-reflection. When the Federation of Literary and Art Circles sent someone to Qingdao to track down the absconding Deng Shoulou and the merchants he colluded with, Liu Zhixia, fearing that his own problems would be discovered in Qingdao, then mentioned that he had had dealings with a certain merchant in Qingdao. This dishonest attitude should certainly be the responsibility of Liu Zhixia himself, but Ding Zhigang (vice chairman) and Feng Yizhi (Director of the Literature and Art Department of the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Branch of the CPC Central Committee, Secretary of the Party Group of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles), who bear the leadership responsibility of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, should also bear certain responsibility. Because from the beginning of the movement, they have adopted a certain degree of protection and leniency towards Liu Zhixia.

It is hoped that the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles can completely eliminate the filth and poison of bourgeois corruption that has affected it since entering the city in this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

### 进一步揭发山东省文联存在的问题

专栏：

    进一步揭发山东省文联存在的问题
    编辑同志：我们认为人民日报二月十一日“读者来信”栏发表的“应该彻底检查山东省文联的工作”一信中，所揭发的事情，完全符合事实。我们在这里作一些补充。
    一、两年来山东省文联从未有计划地组织文艺工作者进行毛泽东文艺思想的学习和文艺创作，也没有组织过文艺工作者深入实际参加群众斗争，在机关内部根本没有批评与自我批评。少数负责干部经常忙于“请客”“招待”，几乎是“朝朝筵会，夜夜笙歌”。一九五一年夏天，他们为省文化处长李微冬“饯行”，买了大批水果、点心、烟、茶，包乘游船逛大明湖，并在历下亭饮酒作乐。这样，不只浪费了国家资财，而且在群众中影响极坏。原文联副主任于寄愚任职一年多以来，经常夜深不睡，请艺人到宿舍唱戏，闲扯胡拉，每天都是中午或下午才起床。他个人好玩鱼，动支公款修建鱼池子，有一个公务员专门去大明湖给鱼捞虫子。但他对于文联的工作及干部情况，却很少认真地研究和注意。
    二、文联机关因人设事、人浮于事的现象也很严重。有的干部的爱人长期不工作，仍要雇保姆；甚至有的干部不做工作，竟雇两个保姆，而文联把这样的事情，美其名曰“照顾干部”。许多有正式工作的干部，工作任务不明确。结果，一个文艺工作的领导机关变成了保姆、闲员、浮员的招待所，正气不得抬头，歪气很盛。
    三、“山东文艺”出版以来，领导干部对每期发行数字，收支数字，都盲然不知。更严重的是长期缺乏对毛泽东文艺思想的学习，小资产阶级和资产阶级的思想日见增长。“山东文艺”创刊以来错误百出，作为“山东文艺”的领导机关山东省文联，对广大读者所提出的正确批判，并未重视和注意，任其在群众中散布错误思想的毒素。
    四、前大观电影院副经理邓守禄，原是奸商，一九四八年潍县解放时混入革命阵营。山东省文联筹备会成立时，邓守禄又被调到由文联管理的大观电影院，文联领导方面并派他为营业部主任，一九五一年十月整编时，又提升他为副经理。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，发现他有严重的贪污罪行，但在他停职反省期间，由于领导方面的官僚主义，他又畏罪潜逃，到现在还没有逮捕归案，这
                也说明了山东省文联在干部政策上的错误。
    五、省文联秘书长刘知侠平时作风恶劣，手脚不干净。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，从开始到现在，他的反省始终是“挤牙膏”式的。譬如他在第一次反省时，只是在人所共知的铺张浪费问题上作了一番极其肤浅的检讨，等到文联派人到与刘知侠来往甚密的“皇宫”照像馆调查时，才发现刘知侠在这个照像馆白洗像片，请客吃喝，而且有受贿的事情。经大家揭发后，他又在第二次反省时谈了出来。当文联派人到青岛追查潜逃的邓守禄及其所勾结的商号时，刘知侠恐怕到青岛又发现自己的问题，于是又谈出了曾与青岛某商号有来往关系。这种不老实的态度固然应由刘知侠自己负责，但负有文联领导责任的丁志刚（副主席）、冯毅之
    （中共中央山东分局宣传部文艺处长，文联党组书记）也应该负一定责任。因为从运动开始，他们就对刘知侠采取了某种程度的袒护和姑息的态度。
    希望山东省文联能在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，把入城以来受资产阶级腐蚀的污毒彻底消除干净。
