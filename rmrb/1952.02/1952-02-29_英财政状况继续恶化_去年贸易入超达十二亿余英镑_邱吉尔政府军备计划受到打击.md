Xinhua News Agency, February 28th: London - Under the policy of stepping up arms expansion and war preparations, Britain's financial situation is deteriorating, which in turn is hitting the military build-up plan implemented by the British government.

The crisis in international payments has been one of the main ailments of the British post-war economy. This crisis has been exacerbated by the expanded war preparations plan. According to a recent report published by the British official Central Office of Information, in the entire year of 1951, the British trade deficit reached as high as 1,208 million pounds, about three and a half times the total deficit in 1950. In January of this year, the trade deficit was 93 million pounds.

The trade deficit has created a huge deficit in international payments, putting Britain in danger of bankruptcy. Since taking office last October, the Conservative government has announced two rounds of import cuts (including imports of food and daily necessities, which the British people are extremely short of,) on November 7th last year and January 29th this year, attempting to fill the loopholes in income and expenditure. However, facts have proved that these measures cannot save the crisis of the British war economy. In the last quarter of last year, Britain's gold and dollar reserves decreased by 934 million U.S. dollars, the largest loss in any quarter in the history of the sterling area. According to a United Press report from London authoritative sources on the 15th, in the seven weeks since the beginning of the new year, Britain's gold and dollar reserves continued to decrease by more than 400 million U.S. dollars, reaching the lowest level since the devaluation of the pound in 1949. Therefore, even the United Press expressed doubts as to "whether these measures can stop (Britain) from falling into the danger of bankruptcy in time."

The continued deterioration of the financial situation has directly hit the military build-up plan formulated in accordance with the will of the United States. When British Prime Minister Churchill reported to the House of Commons on the implementation of the military build-up plan on the 20th, he had to admit that Britain's military build-up work this year was about 10 percent behind the original target. Churchill also admitted that Britain's three-year military build-up plan now "definitely needs more than three years."

However, despite this, the Conservative government, which serves as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism in aggression and war preparations, is still determined to continue to implement the military build-up plan at all costs. In the white paper published on the 21st, it foreshadowed that in the 1952-1953 fiscal year, military budget appropriations will increase to 1,377.2 million pounds. This exceeds the actual expenditure of the previous year by 22 percent. More than 40 percent of this expenditure is stipulated to be used for the production of offensive weapons. The British government's policy of insisting on preparing for war will undoubtedly push Britain further into the abyss of bankruptcy.

The British Communist Party's "Daily Worker" lashed out at the Conservative government's policy of violating the interests of the people and leading Britain to economic collapse in its editorial on the 22nd, and emphasized that only when the British people rise up to protest the government's anti-people measures and demand the conclusion of a five-power peace pact and the reduction of the arms expansion plan, can Britain be spared from disaster.

### 英财政状况继续恶化  去年贸易入超达十二亿余英镑  邱吉尔政府军备计划受到打击

    英财政状况继续恶化
    去年贸易入超达十二亿余英镑
    邱吉尔政府军备计划受到打击
    【新华社二十八日讯】伦敦消息：在加紧扩军备战的政策下，英国财政状况日益恶化，这反过来又打击了英国政府所执行的军备计划。
    国际收支上的危机一直是英国战后经济的主要病症之一，这一危机已因扩大的备战计划而益发严重。据英国官方中央新闻处最近发表的报告书，一九五一年全年，英国贸易入超高达十二亿零八百万英镑，约为一九五○年入超总数的三倍半。今年一月份，贸易入超是九千三百万英镑。
    贸易的入超造成了国际收支上的巨大赤字，使英国面临破产的危险。保守党政府自去年十月上台以来，已先后在去年十一月七日和今年一月二十九日，两次宣布削减进口（包括英国人民极其缺乏的食物和日用品的进口，）企图借此弥补收支上的漏洞。但是事实证明，这些措施并不能挽救英国备战经济的危机。去年最后一季中，英国黄金美元储备减少了九亿三千四百万美元，为英镑区有史以来任何一季中为数最大的损耗量。据合众社十五日引伦敦权威人士消息，新年开始后的七个星期中，英国黄金美元储备继续减少了四亿多美元，达到一九四九年英镑贬值以来的最低水平。因此，连合众社也表示怀疑这些措施“是否能够及时制止（英国）陷入破产的危险”。
    财政状况的继续恶化直接打击了遵照美国意旨制订的扩军计划。英国首相邱吉尔二十日向下院报告扩军计划执行情况时不得不承认：本年度英国扩军工作落后于预定目标约百分之十。邱吉尔还承认，英国的三年扩军计划现在“确实需要三年以上的时间了”。
    但是，尽管如此，充当美国帝国主义在侵略、备战中的头号帮凶的保守党政府，仍然决定不顾一切地继续实行扩军计划，它在二十一日发表的白皮书中预告，一九五二—一九五三财政年度中，军事预算拨款将增加到十三亿七千七百二十万英镑。这超过上一年度的实际支出百分之二十二。这笔支出的百分之四十以上规定用于生产进攻用的武器。英国政府这种坚持准备战争的政策，无疑将把英国进一步推向破产的深渊。
    英国共产党的“工人日报”在二十二日的社论中痛斥保守党政府这种违反人民利益使英国走向经济崩溃的政策，并着重指出：只有英国人民起来抗议政府的反人民措施，并要求缔结五大国和平公约、削减扩张军备计划，才能使英国免于灾难。
