Introducing Beijing's Experience in Inspecting Illegal Industrial and Commercial Businesses

From January 13th to February 2nd, the Beijing Municipal Committee for Thrift and Inspection organized more than 7,000 people into over 500 inspection teams to inspect illegal industrial and commercial businesses, achieving great success. The following is a summary of Beijing's inspection work:

I. Where to Start

With so many industrial and commercial businesses, where should the inspection begin? This was the first problem encountered. Beijing determined the targets of inspection based on reports from the people and confessions from personnel of state organs. Since the widespread launch of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, people from all walks of life and personnel of state organs have reported and confessed a large amount of material. The Municipal Committee for Thrift and Inspection conducted in-depth research on these materials and discovered many serious problems that harmed the interests of the state and the people. The inspection work focused on those industries that had the most contact with state organs, caused the greatest harm to the state, and most frantically attacked the proletariat. After determining the key industries, it was also necessary to determine the key households. This was decided not only based on the extent of the harm to the state, but also on their degree of confession. Those industrial and commercial households that caused the greatest harm to the state and refused to confess were the first to be inspected. The inspection of non-key industries was also carried out with a focus.

II. Organizing the Teams

The inspection team was very large, the front line was extremely broad, and the problems were very complex. Therefore, to make such a large team respond flexibly, command uniformly, and exert its strength, it was first necessary to have a strong command headquarters. The Beijing Municipal Committee for Thrift and Inspection established an inspection team command headquarters to specifically lead and direct the work of the inspection teams. Under the municipal command headquarters, each district established a sub-command headquarters, and industry command headquarters were established according to the key inspection industries. After the inspection teams went to the industrial and commercial households, they were uniformly led by the sub-command headquarters. Those inspection teams that inspected key industries were simultaneously commanded and led by the industry command headquarters in order to focus on studying the specialized issues related to the relevant industries. In order to understand the situation and solve problems in a timely manner, the sub-command headquarters established a liaison group and maintained a certain amount of mobile force. The mobile force mainly dealt with newly occurring problems in each group. For example, if the accounts of some inspected households were very complicated, and the accounting personnel originally assigned to the inspection team were relatively thin, then the sub-command headquarters could dispatch mobile tax personnel to provide support. The task of the liaison group was to maintain close contact with each inspection team, collect the progress, problems, and experiences of the work from each group every day, and report to the municipal command headquarters. In this way, the municipal command headquarters could fully grasp the overall situation, determine the principles and steps, and exchange experiences, linking the teams scattered on various fronts into a fighting whole, achieving a unified response. For example, if individual teams had slight deviations in the implementation of policies or encountered difficulties in their work, the municipal command headquarters could promptly convene a meeting of team leaders to correct the shortcomings and propose solutions to overcome the difficulties; if a team created good working methods, the command headquarters could promptly disseminate these experiences to each inspection team to promote the work.

III. Allocating Resources

The personnel participating in the inspection team included cadres from military and government organs and people's organizations, democratic personages, university professors, literary and art workers, staff members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and students from major universities and cadre schools. Among the cadres, there were military and government cadres, public security personnel, and tax personnel. Among these, with the exception of a small number who came from certain organs to inspect issues related to their own organs, the others were all transferred from various organs and schools. Their political level and struggle experience were very inconsistent. Therefore, how to properly allocate such complex personnel became the second important problem in organizing the work. Beijing's experience is: except for those who came to inspect issues related to their own organs, who were not disrupted and were assigned public security and tax personnel, a mixed composition was generally adopted. Because the inspection work included questioning, collecting and sorting materials, auditing, security, and mobilizing the masses, questioning required cadres with more struggle experience, auditing was a task that tax personnel were more familiar with, collecting and sorting materials was a task that intellectuals were better at, and security work was best done by public security personnel, while mobilizing the masses was a task that everyone could do. Therefore, a mixed compilation was more appropriate. Experience has shown that any inappropriate allocation would affect the work. For example, among the 160 inspection teams organized before the Spring Festival, individual teams were composed entirely of literary and art workers or professors and students, except for public security personnel and tax personnel. As a result, due to their lack of struggle experience and insufficient understanding of the essence of the bourgeoisie's cunning, deceitful, and profit-seeking nature, they one-sidedly believed in the "confessions" of capitalists, focusing their efforts on persuading capitalists while neglecting to mobilize the workers and shop assistants, so that the work could not progress rapidly. For example, among the more than 300 teams organized after the Spring Festival, some individual teams were initially all students, who did not understand accounts and did not know how to question, and did not know where to start. After tax personnel were added and the leadership was strengthened, there was a significant change in the work. However, when allocating resources, it is also necessary to prevent the tendency of egalitarianism. For some key industries or key households, because the problems are large and complex, it is absolutely necessary to allocate stronger cadres. In addition, it is also important to take care of each person's original familiar business as much as possible. For example, if a professor studies architectural engineering and is assigned to inspect the construction industry, he will be familiar with it, but if a professor who studies electrical engineering is assigned to the construction industry, he will have to start from scratch.

IV. Pre-War Preparations

After the team is organized, it will be put into battle. This is also like the army's operations. In order to win the battle, a series of preparations must be made before the operation. The preparations for the inspection team are:

The first is ideological preparation. Every member of the inspection team must fully recognize the essence of the bourgeoisie's profit-seeking, harming others for their own benefit, speculation, and decadent nature, as well as its cunning, deceit, and insidious face. Thus, they must draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves ideologically, and be determined to fight to the end in order to achieve victory. Lu Junfeng, the manager of Yufeng Paper Mill, was very cunning. Before the inspection team arrived, he went to the Federation of Industry and Commerce to make a false confession, saying how progressive he was. After the inspection team arrived, he also used sweet words to express his welcome, saying: I have long hoped that you will come to understand the situation of Yufeng, pretending to be very open-minded, but not confessing to the problem. Because the inspection team had sufficient ideological preparation, it exposed the conspiracy of the奸商 (cunning merchant), and was determined: The problem will not be thoroughly solved, and the troops will never be withdrawn. Therefore, victory was finally achieved. Another team, because of insufficient ideological understanding of the capitalists, thought that the capitalists were "honest" and "there was no problem" when they pretended to be pitiful, and relaxed their fighting will, giving the capitalists a chance to take advantage of. This team did not check out the problem until it increased its strength again.

The second is policy preparation. Because this is a political struggle, every member must be familiar with the policy and understand that this struggle is to defeat the bourgeoisie's attack politically and ideologically, and to eliminate the bourgeoisie's speculative, stealing state property, and harming the people's interests in the economic field, but not to eliminate the bourgeoisie. In the more than 500 teams organized in two times, they generally mastered these policy principles. However, individual teams did not deeply understand the policy, and there were slight deviations in the implementation. After the command headquarters discovered these phenomena, it immediately corrected them.

In addition, there is the work of preparing materials. The inspection team must fully study the materials reported by the people and confessed by the personnel of the state organs, and grasp the key to the problem. If some materials are not sufficient, they must collect materials while working after arriving at the scene. Only by collecting enough materials and grasping the key to these materials can we break the firm fortress of the奸商 (cunning merchant).

V. Work Experience

How to start working after arriving at the scene? Countless experiences have proved that relying on workers and shop assistants, uniting employees, and fully mobilizing the masses are the keys to victory. Jiang Zhenzhi, the capitalist of the Guangda Wood Factory, was very cunning. Before the inspection team arrived, he had made full preparations to get through the customs. He paid workers and employees several months' salary to buy them off, especially trying to win over the employees who knew his details - accountants, runners, etc. - and prepared a set of false confessions, and sent his cronies into the trade union to manipulate it. In this way, it cannot be said that his defense line is not solid. However, the inspection team first mobilized the workers, learned some clues from the workers, and then won over the employees, and finally broke his defense line. The basic method of mobilizing workers is to carry out education, improve their class consciousness, draw a clear line between the class and the capitalists, mobilize workers to accuse, explain the ugly face of the奸商 (cunning merchant) exploiting workers and harming the country, expose the capitalists' conspiracies and tricks, and break through the concerns. Most of the employees have close relations with the capitalists, and even are people who carry out illegal activities for the capitalists. Therefore, in addition to carrying out class education like workers, they should also explain the stakes, call on them not to be burdened by the 奸商 (cunning merchant), explain that all illegal activities should be the responsibility of the capitalists, and ask them to resolutely return to the ranks of the workers. In this way, the capitalists felt extremely isolated, and they were often forced to confess to the problem. Individual inspection teams did not understand the importance of relying on workers and uniting employees, and failed to achieve victory. For example, the staff of Group 401 treated the workers, employees, and capitalists in the factory the same way, which isolated themselves and left them helpless.

Grasping the key points and seizing the key issues is the key to the inspection work to quickly solve the battle. For example, the inspection of the construction industry should focus on large projects in all projects. In the inspection of the project, it is necessary to first grasp the key issues such as overestimating price differences, obtaining state property, stealing and reducing the main building materials in the project - wood, ocean ash, iron bars, and replacing public good materials with inferior materials. If the key issues are resolved, the other issues can be easily solved. Group 492 was able to seize the key points and key issues, and solved three battles in seventeen days. Some groups failed to solve this problem, and got a lot of materials, but did not distinguish between the main and secondary, thus wasting time.

Taking care of the overall situation and unifying the pace is the link to win the overall victory. There are two situations. One situation is: a few cadres who came to inspect issues related to their own organs must obey the whole. Because the industrial and commercial households being inspected often have other problems besides the problems of that organ, the local problems must be solved in the process of solving all the problems. Individual groups had individual cadres who only engaged in the problems of their own organs, so that the 奸商 (cunning merchant) could take advantage of the gap, and the problem was not thoroughly solved. Another situation is that the entire group must have appropriate division of labor, and the work must be planned and step-by-step. Individual groups did not have a unified pace. This one went to ask the 奸商 (cunning merchant) a question, and that one went to ask a question, and the answers were inconsistent, which made the capitalists figure out our bottom line, and the work was not easy to carry out.

Boldly using cadres within the inspection team is also an important part of carrying out the work. Group 123 boldly handed over the policy to the cadres and staff and workers, and let the cadres and activists among the staff and workers to carry out the tasks, so that they strengthened their sense of ownership, and played their enthusiasm and creativity. Some of them, although they had little struggle experience in the past, also made good achievements, and were tempered and progressed rapidly. Individual groups were not trusting enough of the cadres, shrinking their hands and feet, and the work was not properly assigned, which reduced everyone's enthusiasm and the work was not done well.

The inspection team and the trade union and the Federation of Industry and Commerce must cooperate with each other to create an internal and external attack on the capitalists. Some sub-command headquarters closely contacted the Federation of Industry and Commerce and obtained the materials of the 奸商 (cunning merchant) violating the law, and they could rely on the trade union to mobilize the staff and workers, so that the 奸商 (cunning merchant) felt unable to resist the power of the masses and had to confess to the problem.

In addition, the staff of the inspection team must also study business and be good at summarizing and absorbing the work experience of other groups. Studying business is for the convenience of grasping the key to the problem. For example, to inspect the construction industry, you must be familiar with the key points of stealing state property in the construction industry. If you can't grasp the key points, you can only come up with some small things, but you can't find big problems; summarizing and absorbing experience is to learn the method and carry out the work. For example, the first district command headquarters promptly convened each group to exchange experience. Some groups that could not carry out the work learned the working methods of other groups and opened up the situation.

VI. Rest and Await Orders

After the team has completely completed a task, the Municipal Committee for Thrift and Inspection will deal with the industrial and commercial households separately according to the severity of the circumstances and the attitude of the 奸商 (cunning merchant), ordering the industrial and commercial households to obtain bail and await disposal or immediately arrest them and bring them to justice. At this time, the inspection team will withdraw to the command headquarters for a short period of rest, summarize and exchange experiences, and prepare to enter the next battle.

    介绍北京市检查不法工商业户的经验
    北京市节约检查委员会从上月十三日到本月二日，先后组织了七千余人、五百多个检查小组，对不法工商业户进行检查，获得了巨大的成绩。现在把北京市进行检查工作的情况作一概括的介绍：
    一、从何着手
    工商业户这样多，从那里着手检查？这是首先碰到的问题。北京市是根据人民群众的检举和机关工作人员的坦白材料来确定检查对象的。自反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动广泛开展以后，各阶层人民、机关工作人员都检举和坦白了大批材料，市节约检查委员会对这些材料作了深入的研究，发现了许多严重危害国家人民利益的问题。检查工作就抓住重点，首先从那些与国家机关关系最多、危害国家最大、向无产阶级进攻最疯狂的行业检查起。在重点行业确定之后，还要确定重点户，这除了根据对国家危害的大小来决定外，还要看他们的坦白程度。那些危害国家最大而又拒不坦白的工商户，就是首先检查的对象。对非重点行业的检查工作，更是有重点地进行。
    二、组织队伍
    检查组的队伍非常庞大，战线极其广阔，问题也很复杂。因此，要使这样一支庞大的队伍呼应灵活、指挥统一、发挥力量，首先须要有一个坚强的指挥部。北京市在市节约检查委员会下设立了检查组指挥部，专门负责领导和指挥检查组的工作。在市指挥部之下，各区设立分指挥部，此外并按重点检查行业设立行业指挥部。各检查组下到工商户后，统一受分指挥部领导。那些检查重点行业的检查组，同时受行业指挥部的指挥和领导，以便集中研究有关行业的专门问题。为了及时了解情况，解决问题，分指挥部设有联络组，并保持一定的机动力量。机动力量主要是应付各组新发生的问题，比如有的被查户账目很复杂，而检查组查账的人员原来配备得比较单薄，这时分指挥部就可调遣机动的税务人员前往支援。联络组的任务是负责与各检查组取得密切的联系，每天到各组收集工作进展情况、问题和经验，向市指挥部汇报。这样，市指挥部即可充分地掌握全盘情况，来确定方针、步骤和交流经验，把分散在各个战线上的队伍联结成一个战斗整体，做到一呼百应。比如个别的小组在执行政策上稍有偏差，或工作上遇到困难，市指挥部即可及时召开小组长会议，纠正缺点，提出克服困难的办法；有的组创造了好的工作方法，指挥部即可把这些经验及时传播到各个检查组，推动工作。
    三、配备力量
    参加检查组的工作人员，有军政机关和人民团体的干部、民主人士、大学教授、文艺工作者、工商业联合会的工作人员、各大专学校和干部学校的学生。在干部中，有军政干部、公安人员，还有税务人员。在这中间，除了很少一部分是某些机关为了检查与他本机关有关的问题而来的外，其他都是由各机关、学校抽调来的。他们的政治水平、斗争经验都极不一致。因此，如何把这样复杂的人员配备得当，就成了组织工作的第二个重要问题。北京市的经验是：除了对那些为了检查与本机关有关问题而来的人员不予打乱、另配以公安、税务人员外，一般都采取混合编制。因为在检查中有问话、搜集和整理材料、查账、保卫和发动群众等工作，问话需要比较有斗争经验的干部担任，查账是税务人员比较熟悉的工作，搜集和整理材料的工作是知识分子擅长些，保卫工作由公安人员担任最恰当，发动群众的工作是大家都可以作的。因此，打乱混编比较适宜。经验证明：凡是配备得不恰当的都会影响工作。比如在春节前组织的一百六十个检查组中，有个别小组除了公安人员、税务人员外，“青一色”地由文艺工作者或教授、学生组成。结果由于他们的斗争经验少，对资产阶级的奸诈狡猾、唯利是图的本质认识不足，片面地相信资本家的“坦白”，以主要力量去说服资本家，而忽略了发动工人、店员群众，以致工作不能迅速进展。又如春节后组织的三百多个小组中，起先有个别小组全是学生，不懂账目，也不会问话，不知道从何着手。以后增加了税务人员，加强了领导，工作就有了显著的转变。但在配备力量时，也要防止平均主义的倾向，对某些重点行业或重点户，因为问题大而复杂，干部须配备强一些，这是完全必要的。此外，尽可能地照顾每个人原来熟悉的业务也很重要。比如有的教授是学建筑工程的，把他配备去检查营造业，他就驾轻就熟，反之，把学电机的配备到营造业去，他就得从头学起。
    四、战前准备
    队伍组织好以后，就要投入战斗了。这也和军队作战一样，为了赢得战斗的胜利，在作战以前，还必须作一系列的准备工作。检查组要准备的是：
    首先是思想准备。每一个参加检查组的人员，都必须充分认识到资产阶级唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧、堕落腐朽的本质，以及它的奸诈、狡猾、阴险的面目，从而在思想上划清敌我界限，下定坚决斗争到底的决心，才能取得胜利。裕丰纸行的经理吕钧丰非常狡猾，在检查组还未去以前，他就到工商业联合会进行假坦白，表示他如何进步；检查组去了以后，他还花言巧语地表示欢迎说：我早就希望你们来了解裕丰的情况，装出很开明的样子，却不交代问题。由于检查组有足够的思想准备，揭破了奸商的阴谋，并下定决心：问题不搞彻底决不收兵，因而终于取得了胜利。另外一个组因为思想上对资本家的认识不足，看到资本家装出一付可怜的样子，就以为资本家“老实”，“没有什么问题”，松懈了战斗意志，就给了资本家以可乘之隙。这个组直到重新增加力量，才把问题检查出来。
    其次是政策准备。因为这是政治斗争，每一个成员都必须熟悉政策，明白这个斗争是在政治上、思想上打垮资产阶级的进攻，在经济上肃清资产阶级的投机取巧、盗窃国家资财、损害人民利益的唯利是图的丑恶行为，而不是消灭资产阶级。在两次组织的五百多个小组中，一般都能掌握这些政策原则。但也有个别小组对政策体会不深，在执行上略有偏差，指挥部发觉这些现象后，就立即加以纠正。
    此外还有准备材料的工作。检查组对于人民群众检举和机关工作人员坦白的材料，必须事先作充分的研究，掌握问题的关键所在；有个别材料不够充分的还必须在到达现场后，一面工作，一面搜集材料。只有收集到足够的材料，而且掌握这些材料的关键，才能击破奸商坚固的堡垒。
    五、工作经验
    到达现场以后如何开始工作？无数的经验都证明：依靠工人、店员，团结职员，充分发动群众，是取得胜利的关键。广大木厂的资方姜振之非常狡猾，在检查组到达以前，已作了朦混过关的充分准备。他给工人、职员多发了几个月的薪金进行收买，特别是加劲拉拢了知道他底细的职员——会计、跑外等，同时准备好了一套假坦白，又派遣了他的亲信打入工会进行操纵。这样，不能说他的防线不坚固了。但检查组首先发动了工人，在工人中间了解了一些线索，然后又争取了职员，终于攻破了他的防线。发动工人的基本办法是进行教育，提高他们的阶级觉悟，与资方划清阶级界限，发动工人控诉，说明奸商剥削工人，危害国家的丑恶面貌，揭露资本家的阴谋伎俩，打破顾虑。职员中间多半与资方有密切的关系，甚至是替资方进行违法活动的人。因此，对他们除了和工人一样进行阶级教育外，还要说明利害关系，号召他们不要为奸商所累，说明一切非法行为都应由资本家负责，要他们坚决回到工人的队伍里来。这样，发动了工人，争取了职员，资本家感到自己极端孤立了，往往也就被迫交代了问题。个别检查组不懂得依靠工人和团结职员的重要，就没能取得胜利。如四零一组的工作人员把厂内的工人、职员和资本家一样看待，结果孤立了自己，以致束手无策。
    掌握重点、抓住关键问题，是检查工作迅速解决战斗的关键。比如检查营造业就应以所有工程中的大工程为重点。在检查工程中，又必须首先抓住高估差价、套取国家资财、偷减工程中的主要建筑用料——木材、洋灰、铁筋和以次料换取公家好料等关键问题。关键问题解决了，其他也就可以迎刃而解。四九二组因为能抓住了重点和关键问题，在十七天之内就解决了三个战斗。有些组由于这问题没有解决，材料搞了一大堆，主要的和次要的不分，因而浪费了时间。
    照顾全局、统一步调，是获得全胜的环节。这有两种情况，一种情况是：少数为检查和本机关有关的问题而来的干部，必须服从整体。因为被检查的工商户除了那个机关的问题外，往往还有别的问题，必须在解决全部问题中来解决局部问题。有个别小组曾发生个别干部只搞本机关的问题，就使奸商有隙可乘，问题搞不彻底。另外一种情况是整个小组必须有适当的分工，工作有计划、有步骤。有个别小组步调不统一，这个去找奸商问一顿话，那个也去问，结果说话不一致，反叫资本家摸了我们的底子，工作不好开展。
    检查组内部大胆使用干部，也是开展工作的重要一环。一二三组大胆把政策交给干部和职工群众，放手把任务交给干部和职工中的积极分子，就使他们加强了主人翁的感觉，发挥了积极性和创造性。其中有些人虽然过去斗争经验少也作出了很好的成绩，而且得到了锻炼，进步很快。个别的组因为对干部信任不够，缩手缩脚，工作分配不适当，就减低了大家的积极性，工作也未作好。
    检查组和工会、工商业联合会要互相配合，造成对资本家的内外夹攻之势。有的分指挥部与工商业联合会密切联系，取得了奸商违法的材料，又能依靠工会发动职工，结果就使得奸商感到无法抗拒群众的力量，不得不交代问题。
    此外，检查组的工作人员还必须学习业务，善于总结和吸取别组的工作经验。学习业务是为的便于掌握问题的关键，比如检查营造业，就必须熟悉营造业盗窃国家资财的关节所在，如果抓不到关节，就只能搞出一些小事，而找不到大问题；总结和吸取经验是为了学得方法，开展工作。如一区分指挥部及时召集各组交流了经验，有些原来工作不能开展的小组，学习了别组的工作方法，就打开了局面。
    六、休整待命
    小组把一次任务完全完成以后，市节约检查委员会即根据小组检查结果，按照情节轻重和奸商的态度分别进行处理，令该工商业户取保具结听候处理或立即予以逮捕法办。这时，检查组即撤回指挥部进行短期的休整，总结和交流经验，准备投入下一次战斗。
