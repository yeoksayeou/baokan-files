The Central Ministry of Health held a general staff meeting on February 7th to struggle against major embezzlers Xu Jimin and Wang Zhicai.

Major embezzler Xu Jimin was the Director of the Administrative and Financial Department of the Central Ministry of Health. He joined the revolution in 1938 and the Communist Party in 1940. As the Director of the Supply Department of the Northeast Military Region Health Department in 1947, Xu Jimin colluded with unscrupulous merchants and began stealing people's property. The unscrupulous merchants Jiao Yubo and Wang Zhenggang followed him from Harbin to Shenyang, and from Shenyang to Beijing. Xu Jimin even personally directed them in armed smuggling, selling gold, lending at usurious rates, and engaging in speculation and profiteering. In this way, Xu Jimin fattened the unscrupulous merchants Jiao Yubo and Wang Zhenggang with state property and the people's blood and sweat; Jiao Yubo and Wang Zhenggang were able to open the Kunlun Pharmaceutical Factory in Tianjin. Since the Kunlun Pharmaceutical Factory opened ten months ago, its transaction volume has reached 820 million yuan, of which the transaction volume of the Tianjin Branch and Northeast Branch of the State-owned Pharmaceutical Corporation accounted for 70%. In early 1950, Xu Jimin privately lent 165 million yuan of public funds to unscrupulous merchants. After being discovered by leaders, he was forced to recover it; he feigned compliance and said he had recovered it, but to this day, more than 50 million yuan is still in the hands of the unscrupulous merchants. He embezzled 300 million yuan of public funds to Shanghai for speculative business in medicine, and forged false receipts for more than 1.3 billion yuan in accounting. He sold moldy cigarettes that unscrupulous merchants gave him, which he couldn't finish smoking, to the public for use as hospitality cigarettes. The bribes that unscrupulous merchants gave him, such as leather shoes, bed sheets, raincoats, cigarettes, alcohol, and fruit, were countless; currently, he still has three watches, one of which is worth 8 million yuan, five "Parker 51" and "Sheaffer" fountain pens, five small gold ingots, and radios, etc. Xu Jimin once complained to leading comrades that his family had no food to eat and requested subsidies. In reality, his family had newly built more than 20 houses, bought three and a half mu of new land, and opened a flour mill and Chinese and Western pharmacies. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he did not attend Party meetings and played mahjong at home. He deposited 10 million yuan of public funds in the private Dahua Securities Firm to earn interest, which he squandered at will, going to restaurants and visiting prostitutes. According to preliminary estimates, the state assets he stole in collusion with unscrupulous merchants have reached more than 210 million yuan. His personal embezzlement and bribery amounted to more than 100.37 million yuan. However, he has consistently refused to confess his theft and embezzlement. The CCP Central People's Government Ministry of Health Party Committee announced at the struggle meeting that Xu Jimin was expelled from the Party. The administrative side of the Central Ministry of Health announced that Xu Jimin was removed from his post and handed over to the People's Court for punishment.

Major embezzler Wang Zhicai was the Chief Accountant of the Central People's Hospital, a retained employee, with three wives. He had been consistently embezzling during the enemy and puppet regime period; after liberation, his bad habits remained unchanged. He used his position and authority to create false accounts, over-report employee meal expenses and salaries, and embezzle public funds to deposit in banks for interest, embezzling a total of more than 155 million yuan. After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, he tried to conceal his crimes and refused to confess. He even secretly hid a gold ring in his pocket, intending to swallow the gold and commit suicide if he was exposed. After the leading comrades and the masses patiently enlightened and educated him in many ways, he gradually confessed some of the facts of his embezzlement. His criminal behavior is serious, but after being exposed, he was able to confess some of the facts of his embezzlement and made supplementary confessions, and his attitude was relatively sincere. Therefore, the administrative side of the Central Ministry of Health announced at the struggle meeting that he was given a deadline of the 15th of this month to make a more thorough confession; and he was asked to actively expose others and make amends for his crimes, and his handling would be decided based on his confession and meritorious service.

    中央卫生部开会斗争大贪污犯徐济民等
    徐犯始终不肯坦白已被开除党籍并撤职送法院惩办
    中央卫生部全体工作人员二月七日举行全体工作人员大会，斗争大贪污分子徐济民、王之才。
    大贪污分子徐济民，是中央卫生部行政财务处处长，一九三八年参加革命，一九四○年加入共产党。徐济民在一九四七年任东北军区卫生部供给处处长时，就勾结奸商，开始偷盗人民财产。奸商矫玉波、王振纲由哈尔滨跟他到沈阳，由沈阳又跟到北京。徐济民并曾亲自指挥他们武装走私，贩卖黄金，放高利贷，投机倒把。这样，徐济民用国家的财产、人民的血汗养肥了奸商矫玉波、王振纲；矫玉波、王振纲得以在天津开设了昆仑药厂。昆仑药厂开办十个月以来，交易额达八亿二千多万元，其中国营医药总公司天津分公司、东北分公司的成交额就占百分之七十。徐济民曾于一九五○年初，私将公款一亿六千五百万元借给奸商，经领导人发现后，迫令他追回；他阳奉阴违地说是收回来了，但直到现在，仍有五千余万元存在奸商手里。他曾挪用公款三亿元到上海作医药投机生意，并造假单据报账十三亿多元。他把奸商送给他吸不完而霉坏了的纸烟，卖给公家作招待烟。奸商向他大量行贿的皮鞋、床单、雨衣、烟、酒、水果等难以计算；现还存有手表三只，其中一只价值八百万元，“五一派克”和“犀飞利”钢笔五枝，黄金小元宝五个及收音机等。徐济民曾向领导同志哭穷，说家里没饭吃，请求补助。实际上他家新修房子二十多间，新买地三亩半，开着粉房和中西药房。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，他不参加党的会议，在家中打麻将。他把公款一千万元存在私营大华证券行得利钱，供他任意挥霍，上馆子，嫖妓女。他勾结奸商所偷窃的国家资财，据初步估计已达两亿一千多万元。他个人的贪污、受贿约一亿零三百七十多万元。但他始终不肯坦白自己的盗窃、贪污行为。中共中央人民政府卫生部机关委员会在斗争大会上宣布开除徐济民的党籍。中央卫生部行政方面宣布把徐济民撤职，并送交人民法院惩办。
    大贪污分子王之才，是中央人民医院的会计主任，留用人员，有三个老婆，在敌伪统治时期就一贯贪污；解放后恶习仍然未改，利用职权，采取造假账，多报员工膳费及薪金，挪用公款放在银行生息等方式，贪污计达一亿五千五百多万元。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，他曾设法隐瞒，拒不坦白，并曾在衣袋中偷藏金戒指一枚，以备一旦被揭发时吞金自杀。经过领导同志和群众对他多方耐心启发教育以后，他才陆续坦白出部分贪污事实。他犯罪的行为是严重的，但经揭发之后，能坦白出一部分贪污事实，并作了补充坦白，态度尚较诚恳。因此，中央卫生部行政方面在斗争大会上宣布，限他在本月十五日以前，作更彻底的坦白；并要求他积极检举别人，戴罪立功，看他坦白及立功情况，再决定对他如何处理。
