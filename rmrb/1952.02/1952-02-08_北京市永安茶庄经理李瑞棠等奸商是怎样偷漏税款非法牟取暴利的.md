Yong'an Tea House, located in Xizhushikou outside Qianmen in Beijing, is one of the largest tea shops in Beijing. Taking the month before the Spring Festival this year as an example, the people who came here to buy tea every day crowded the counter from morning to night. The daily turnover was more than 35 million yuan. But people do not know that the manager of Yong'an Tea House has a consistent record of deceiving the people and the country, violating government decrees, evading national taxes, and adulterating tea.

The tea house is a branch of Yong'an Tea House in Tianjin; manager Li Ruitang and Wu Xingchen were both agents sent from the Tianjin head office. They have more than ten methods of evading taxes through accounting and goods. In the two years of 1950 and 1951, it has been found that Yong'an Tea House evaded more than 670 million yuan in taxes. Yong'an Tea House's accounts have always been chaotic. There were five large boxes of stubs for unified delivery notes opened in 1951, but none of the "sales accounts" were written based on the invoices. According to the accountant, the "sales accounts" were only for coping with government audits. In order to facilitate the arbitrary transfer of funds and evade income tax, the奸商 Li Ruitang and others implemented a so-called "small transfer ticket system." He said to the salespeople: "We use 'small tickets' so everyone can compete to see who sells the most, and the year-end bonus will be based on this in the future." He numbered the salespeople and asked them to write the total amount of money each person sold each day on the "small transfer ticket" and hand it over to the accountant. The accountant deducted a portion of the money from these amounts, left an integer, recorded it in the "sales ledger," and then pieced it together in the "sales account" and destroyed the "small transfer tickets." The figures on the books are very neat, with no odd amounts less than ten thousand yuan. In this way, the manager and accountant could take money at will, so the number of "leaks" was very large. In his preliminary self-criticism, chief accountant Jin Delin admitted that he used this method to take 18 million yuan.

Yong'an Tea House played even more tricks on the "goods." They used the method of "increasing costs and reducing net profit" on the books to evade income tax. Every time they went from "discounted goods" (discounted boxes) to "finished goods" (preparation), they overreported the price of the goods, averaging an increase of 48 percent, with the highest reaching 220 percent. For example, once 100 jin of tea costing 250,000 yuan was made into various teas, and the cost "changed" to 800,000 yuan per 100 jin. The accounts for fresh flowers were even more randomly reported. The annual average for 1951 was 70 percent more, and sometimes even more than 480 percent. For example, on January 26, 1951, 6,850 fresh flowers were actually used for allocation, but the "allocation account" stated 40,000 flowers. Fresh fruits and papayas used for smoking tea can be used five or six times in some cases, and fifteen or sixteen times in others, but they reported the account every time they were used.

Adulteration is also one of their despicable methods of seeking exorbitant profits. When preparing tea, they mixed in "grass tea" (mulberry leaves, jujube leaves, etc.). In 1949, they used 7,000 jin of "grass tea," and in 1950, they used more than 5,000 jin; but these were not recorded in the accounts. In addition, when goods were transferred from the Tianjin head office, a 10% "benefit" had to be given to the head office in addition to the purchase price. From the second half of 1949 to the end of 1951, the benefits amounted to more than 650 million yuan. At the same time, the head office gave the branch office rebates. At the end of 1950, it was more than 200 million yuan. All of these were completely untaxed. They also frequently used the method of "fake purchases"
    (the head office issued "empty goods orders") to transfer funds and evade income tax. For example, the 46 million yuan in "year-end bonuses" issued to employees in January 1950 was extracted from net profit in this way. In addition, they also used methods such as discounting the initial inventory, "increasing costs," discounting the final inventory by 30% (the tax bureau stipulates that it should be discounted by 20%), and "reducing net profit" to "benefit from both ends" and evade income tax. Li Ruitang and others also illegally resold 35 taels of gold and 3,000 silver dollars.

Why was Yong'an Tea House able to deceive the government and act recklessly for so long? The main reason is that they used despicable methods to buy off cadres from the tax bureau to help them achieve the purpose of evading national taxes. Zhang Jian'an, the deputy group leader of the special responsibility group of the Sixth Tax Bureau, was one of those who was bought off by them and willingly "served" them. Yong'an Tea House was one of the "typical households" of the tax bureau, and Zhang Jian'an often went there. When he went, Li Ruitang, Wu Xingchen, and others always entertained him with cigarettes, tea, and fresh fruits, and often invited him to dinner. As a result, Zhang Jian'an was lenient in auditing. In January 1951, the expense report submitted by Yong'an Tea House to the tax bureau was untrue, and Zhang Jian'an added three items that were not originally listed: freight, fresh flowers, and paper rope, which increased the amount of expenses. In this way, Yong'an Tea House paid 76 million yuan less in taxes. After Zhang Jian'an did this for Yong'an Tea House, in order to thank him, manager Li Ruitang and chief accountant Jin Delin personally sent him 4 million yuan in RMB and 128,000 yuan per jin of tea. In order to deceive the employees, the奸商 Li Ruitang and others first asked a trusted employee to take the "gift" by bicycle to the alley near Zhang Jian'an's home and wait, and then they took it in and recorded a purchase of "flour" on the books. These 4 million yuan and one jin of tea bought off Zhang Jian'an, and Zhang Jian'an betrayed the people in this way, obediently at the mercy of the奸商 Li Ruitang and others, shielding the奸商 from evading taxes hundreds of times greater than this amount.

The奸商 Li Ruitang tried every means to evade taxes. When the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy was in full swing, not only did he not recognize his mistakes and make a thorough confession, but he also tried every means to resist the movement. When the fourth extension of the confession period for the Beijing business community was about to expire, he found a "worker representative" who had been bought off by him to jointly conduct a sham audit, and the result was that there was "no" tax evasion problem. He also cunningly wrote a fake confession in the name of all the employees of Yong'an Tea House and submitted it to the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the trade union, but in reality the employees did not know about it at all. Li Ruitang also said to the "worker representative":
    "Apart from the 4 million yuan (referring to the bribe given to Zhang Jian'an), we have no other problems in our shop. If anything else is found out, I don't mind being shot." During the inspection by the inspection team at this tea house, Li Ruitang's attitude was extremely dishonest, and he stubbornly refused to confess. He also cunningly probed the comrades of the inspection team and said: "What should I confess? Give me a hint!" During meals, he secretly touched an accountant with his leg and whispered: "What do you think I should confess?" He also said to the chief accountant: "We only have the problem of 4 million yuan, nothing else!" He did not confess anything except talking about the fact that he arbitrarily "borrowed" money from the shop. When the inspection team specifically pointed it out to him, he pretended to hit his head and said: "Oh, that's right, I forgot." During the inspection by the inspection team, the employees' class consciousness was constantly improving. They were extremely angry at Li Ruitang's attitude of refusing to confess, and repeatedly demanded that the government arrest him. When the People's Government arrested this奸商 according to law on January 29, everyone shouted "Long live the Communist Party!" Employee Chen Yushan said: "The government is standing up for the people and supporting us. I feel really happy today." Xiao Yueqing said: "The capitalists not only deceive the government, but also deceive us workers; arresting him is exactly what we want."

    北京市永安茶庄经理李瑞棠等奸商是怎样偷漏税款非法牟取暴利的
    诸有琼
    北京前门外西珠市口的永安茶庄，在北京要算是最大的茶叶庄之一。就拿今年春节前一个月来说，每天上这儿来买茶叶的人，从早到晚在柜台前面挤得水泄不通。每天的流水额都在三千五百万元以上。但是人们却不知道永安茶庄的经理有着一贯欺骗人民国家、违背政府法令、偷漏国税，并在茶叶中掺假的丑恶罪行。
    这个茶庄是天津永安茶庄的分店；经理李瑞棠和武星臣，都是从天津总店派来的代理人。他们通过账上和货上来偷税的方法就有十几种之多。在一九五○年和一九五一年两年当中，据已经查明的，永安茶庄就偷漏了税款六亿七千多万元。永安茶庄的账目一向就很混乱，一九五一年开的统一发货票的存根就有五大箱，可是“卖钱账”却没有一笔是根据发票写的。据会计员说，“卖钱账”只是为了应付政府查账用的。奸商李瑞棠等为了便于随便抽调资金、逃避所得税，就实行所谓“小传票制”。他对售货员们说：“我们用‘小票’，大伙儿可以比赛，看谁卖得多，将来就根据这个来发年终奖金。”他把售货员编成号，让他们把每天每人售货的总钱数写在“小传票”上，交给会计。会计从这些钱中抽出一部分，留下一个整数，记入“卖钱底账”，然后再在“卖钱账”上分笔拼凑，并把“小传票”毁掉。账面上数字很整齐，连万元以下的零数都没有。这样，经理和会计就可以随便拿钱，因此“漏柜”的数字很大。总会计靳德林在初步检讨中，就承认自己用这种方法拿了一千八百万元。
    永安茶庄在“货”上捣的鬼把戏更多，他们用在账面上“加大成本，减低纯益”的办法来偷漏所得税。他们每次从“折货”（折箱）到“成货”（配制）都多报货价，平均提高百分之四十八，最高的竟达百分之二百二十。如有一次用二十五万元一百斤的茶叶，配成各种茶叶后，于是成本就“变”成八十万元一百斤的了。鲜花的账更是随便乱报，一九五一年全年平均总数多报百分之七十，有时甚至多报百分之四百八十以上。如一九五一年一月二十六日，配货实用鲜花六千八百五十朵，而“配货账”上却写的是四万朵。薰茶叶用的鲜果和木瓜，有的可用五、六次，有的可用十五、六次，但他们却每用一次就报一次账。
    掺假也是他们谋取暴利的卑劣方法之一，他们在配制茶叶时，掺入“草茶”（桑叶、枣叶等）。一九四九年就用了“草茶”七千斤，一九五○年用了五千多斤；而这些在账上却是没有的。还有，从天津总店拨货来时，除了进货价以外，还要给总店提一成“好处”。从一九四九年下半年到一九五一年底，提成就达六亿五千多万元之多。同时，总店又给分店打回扣，一九五○年底就是两亿多元，这些都完全漏税。他们还经常以“假进货”的方式
    （由总店开“空货单”）抽调资金，逃避所得税，如一九五○年一月发给职工“年终奖金”四千六百多万元，就是用这种方式把纯益抽出来的。另外，他们还利用期初盘存打折扣、“加大成本”、期末盘存打七折（税务局规定要打八折）、“减少纯益”等办法，“两头沾光”，来偷漏所得税。李瑞棠等并非法倒卖黄金三十五两，银元三千元。
    永安茶庄为什么竟能这样长期地欺骗政府胡作非为呢？最主要的原因就是他们用卑鄙的手段，收买了税务局的干部来帮助他们达到偷漏国税的目的。税务六分局专责组的副大组长张建安，就是被他们收买、心甘情愿地为他们“服务”的一个。永安茶庄是税务局的“典型户”之一，张建安经常上那儿去。去时，李瑞棠、武星臣等总是以烟、茶、鲜果等招待，还时常请他吃饭。于是张建安在查账上就松了。一九五一年一月里，永安茶庄缴给税务局的开支报表，帐目本就是不真实的，而张建安又给加上了原未列上的运费、鲜花、纸绳等三笔账，这就增加了开支款额，这样永安茶庄就又少缴了七千六百万元的税款。张建安为永安茶庄做了这件事以后，永安茶庄为了酬谢他，就由经理李瑞棠和总会计靳德林亲自给他送去四百万元人民币和十二万八千元一斤的茶叶。奸商李瑞棠等为了蒙蔽店员的耳目，先让一个心腹的店员骑自行车把“礼物”带到张建安家附近的胡同口等着，然后再由他们带进去，回来就下了买“面粉”的账。这四百万元和一斤茶叶就收买了张建安，张建安就这样背叛了人民，俯首贴耳地受奸商李瑞棠等的使唤，包庇奸商偷漏的税款数百倍于这个数字。
    奸商李瑞棠就是这样想尽各种办法来逃税的。当反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动轰轰烈烈地开展的时候，他不但不认识自己的错误，彻底坦白，反而千方百计地来抗拒运动。在北京市工商界第四次展延坦白期限快满时，他找了被他收买的“工人代表”来共同假意进行查账，结果是“没有”漏税问题。他还狡诈地用永安茶庄全体职工的名义写假坦白书交给工商联和工会各一份，实际上店员们根本不知道有这回事。李瑞棠还对“工人代表”说：
    “除了那四百万元的事（指给张建安的贿赂）以外，我们柜上没有别的问题，如果查出来，枪毙我也没有关系。”检查组在这个茶庄进行检查期间，李瑞棠的态度极端不老实，一味耍赖，不肯坦白。他还奸猾地向检查组的同志试探说：“我坦白什么呀？你给我提个头儿吧！”吃饭时，他偷偷地用腿碰一个会计，低声问：“你看我坦白什么好呀？”他又对总会计说：“我们就是那四百万元的问题，别的可没有啦！”他除了谈他在柜上随便“借”钱的事外，什么问题也不交代。等到检查组具体给他指出来时，他又装模做样地打着脑袋说：“哦，对了，是我忘记了。”店员工人们在检查组进行检查期间，阶级觉悟不断提高，他们对于李瑞棠那种死不坦白的态度异常气愤，屡次要求政府逮捕他。当一月二十九日人民政府依法把这个奸商逮捕时，大家都高呼“共产党万岁！”店员陈玉山说：“政府给人民作主，给我们撑腰，今天我真痛快。”萧月清说：“资本家不但欺骗政府，也欺骗我们工人；逮捕他正是我们的要求。”
