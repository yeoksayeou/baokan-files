Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 5th: Chen Guizhen, the wife of "February 7th" martyr Lin Xiangqian, who lives in Minhou County, Fujian Province, wrote a letter to the twenty innocent defendants of the "Matsukawa Incident" in Japan on the eve of the twenty-ninth anniversary of the "February 7th" Massacre, expressing her support for their just struggle against the persecution by the American and Japanese reactionaries, and remitted RMB 50,000 yuan to express her condolences to them. The letter stated:

　　My husband, Lin Xiangqian, was a railway worker and an excellent member of the Chinese Communist Party. Twenty-nine years ago, he fought against the heinous imperialists and Chinese warlords for the benefit of the working class and died a martyr. The spirit of the martyrs will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people, and people across the country hold meetings every year on "February 7th" to commemorate them. The "February 7th" anniversary is approaching, and whenever I look at Xiangqian's portrait, I think of you who are fighting for justice. I hate the American and Japanese reactionaries who have lost their conscience and shamelessly framed you. We must work hard to support your just struggle. We will never allow American imperialism to rearm the Japanese warlords and use the Japanese people as cannon fodder to invade China again. More than 339 million people across the country have already voted to firmly oppose the United States rearming Japan.

　　Chen Guizhen wrote at the end of the letter: Dear brothers: It is still severe winter. I am sending a part of what I have earned from farming - RMB 50,000 yuan - please buy some coal to warm the cold cells that imprison you! Dear brothers: Fight bravely, victory will surely belong to you! Wishing you good health!

  “二七”烈士林祥谦的夫人
    写信给“松川事件”无辜被告
    声援他们反对美日反动派的斗争
    【新华社福州五日电】住在福建省闽侯县的“二七”烈士林祥谦的夫人陈桂贞，在“二七”二十九周年前夕写信给日本“松川事件”二十位无辜被告者，声援他们反对美日反动派迫害的正义斗争，并汇款人民币五万元慰问他们。信中说：
    我的丈夫林祥谦是个铁路工人，也是个优秀的中国共产党党员。他在二十九年前为了工人阶级的利益，向万恶的帝国主义和中国军阀作斗争而从容就义。烈士的精神永远活在中国人民的心里，每年“二七”全国各地人民都开会纪念他们。今年的“二七”快到了，我每当望着祥谦的遗像时，心里就惦念起正在为正义而斗争的你们。我恨透了丧尽天良无耻诬害你们的美日反动派，我们要努力支援你们的正义斗争，我们绝不让美帝国主义重新武装日本军阀把日本人民当炮灰再来侵略中国。我们全国已有三亿三千九百多万人举行了投票，坚决反对美国重新武装日本。
    陈桂贞在信上最后写道：亲爱的弟兄们：现在还是严冬，谨汇上我耕种所得的一部分——人民币五万元，请买些煤炭来温暖监禁你们的阴冷的牢房吧！亲爱的弟兄们：英勇斗争吧，胜利一定属于你们！遥祝身体健康！
