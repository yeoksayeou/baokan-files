    Second Anniversary of the Great Alliance
    Guo Moruo
    Today marks the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This is a very memorable day, and we are joyfully re-expressing our congratulations on our great alliance for defending world peace and opposing imperialist aggression. Due to the conclusion of the Treaty of Alliance, the brotherly friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is even more consolidated and expanded. The unity of the 700 million people of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is an invincible force for peace in the world. This has greatly encouraged the world peace and democracy camp and further increased its enormous advantage in the balance of power with the imperialist aggressive bloc.
    The chief culprit of the aggressive bloc, American imperialism, its world aggression policy is a combination of the policies of the Axis countries that launched the Second World War. In the West, it inherited the traditions of Hitler and Mussolini, and in the East, it accepted the mantle of Japanese imperialism, spreading its two greedy claws to both the East and the West simultaneously, trying to embrace the entire globe into its arms.
    We, the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and with the friendly assistance of the great and selfless Soviet people, after a long and arduous struggle, defeated Japanese imperialism and then completely eliminated the forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which was fully supported by American imperialism, from the mainland, causing American imperialism's claws extended to the East to suffer a heavy blow.
    However, American imperialism is not willing to give up and is not willing to learn its lesson. It failed on the Chinese mainland, but it occupies our Taiwan, still supports the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, and is stubbornly hostile to the entire Chinese people. In June of the year before last, American imperialism even launched a war of aggression against Korea,妄想 to copy the old tricks of Japanese imperialism, annex Korea, and further invade China. This criminal act has once again suffered the punishment it deserved under the joint combat of the heroic Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army, and American imperialism was thus forced to accept the Korean armistice negotiations. However, today it is not only still delaying and obstructing the armistice negotiations and has no sincerity in the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, but on the other hand, it is even more blatantly colluding with the remnants of Japanese imperialism in aggressive acts. The illegal "San Francisco Peace Treaty" and the so-called "US-Japan Bilateral Security Treaty," which are completely hostile to the people of China and the Soviet Union, were concluded last September. Recently, American imperialism has again exerted pressure on the Japanese Yoshida puppet government, which it has single-handedly supported, to combine with the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, and the Yoshida puppet government has also been flattered and obedient to its orders. This shows that the possibility foreseen at the time of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance two years ago has become a reality.
    The treaty stipulates very clearly: The contracting parties shall, by all the means at their disposal, take all necessary steps to prevent a repetition of aggression on the part of Japan or any other State which may unite with Japan, directly or indirectly, in acts of aggression. The remnants of Japanese imperialism are now attempting to rise again, and American imperialism is now recklessly colluding with Japan in aggressive acts. This is exactly the object that our great alliance treaty wants to prevent. We should thank the wisdom of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin, who made far-reaching plans for the cause of defending Asian peace and world peace two years ago. The importance and solemnity of the treaty are even more clearly evident today.
    Since the end of World War II, American imperialism, which妄想es to enslave all mankind, has been constantly increasing its arrogance, but does this indicate that its strength is gradually increasing? No, quite the contrary! We have seen very clearly in the just war of assisting Korea that American imperialism is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and the imperialist aggressive bloc is full of contradictions. As long as our peace and democracy camp strengthens unity and raises vigilance, the imperialist aggression plan and war policy can be completely defeated. We can see very clearly that the aggressive camp headed by American imperialism is weakening day by day, while the world peace and democracy camp, in contrast to it, is growing stronger day by day. The Soviet Union's peaceful construction has entered the stage of communist construction, the friendship between China and the Soviet Union and all people's democratic countries is advancing with the times, and the flames of the oppressed nations all over the world opposing imperialist aggression and striving for national liberation have spread from the Far East to the Middle East, the Near East, and North Africa, and the people of Latin America are also strengthening their struggle against American imperialist enslavement. American imperialism and its satellite countries are becoming more and more flustered in the face of such a growing force for peace. The forces heading for decline feel their own decline more and more, and they become more and more疯狂 in reversing the course of history. The current collusion between the United States, Japan, and Chiang in the East can be said to be the most typical manifestation of this reversal of history. The Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang is not worth mentioning by the people of China and the world. Even the American war販子s say that they are the most corrupt, the most decadent, and the most incompetent group of clowns. And the past events of the Japanese imperialists' extremely brutal massacre of the Chinese people and the Asian people in the war of aggression a few years ago are still fresh in the memories of the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries. Today, American imperialism, embracing them left and right, regards them as the most precious partners and colludes with each other. What kind of power does it hope to generate from this? If a person manipulates a puppet with his left hand and another puppet with his right hand, and embraces the puppets to each other with all his might, will he have three times the power? The collusion between the United States, Japan, and Chiang is such a reality, which only shows the黔驴技穷 of American imperialism.
    However, we are constantly raising our vigilance. We, the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, never overestimate the enemy's strength, nor do we underestimate it. Regarding the collusion between American and Japanese imperialism and the attempt of Japanese imperialism to rise again, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, personally concluded by Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin, has taught us to prevent it two years ago. The preventive measures are written very meticulously in the treaty. What is the situation of our implementation of the treaty in the past two years? We have made achievements in enriching our strength to prevent aggression, in jointly consolidating peace and universal security, and in developing and consolidating the economic and cultural relations between the two countries. Our great alliance treaty has been faithfully practiced by the people of China and the Soviet Union for two years. We always thank the Soviet people for their selfless assistance to us, and our victories on the Korean War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea front, our victories on the land reform front, our victories on the front of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and all our victories on the economic and cultural fronts should be a good reward for our great allies. Today, we want to commemorate the second anniversary of our alliance treaty, and the best way is to further consolidate and expand our victory. We must abide by Chairman Mao's instructions, vigorously practice increasing production and practicing economy, continue to strengthen the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and strive for greater victories in the newly opened front, the movement against corruption, against waste, and against bureaucracy.
    In a country where the people are the masters, all expressions of patriotism are linked to the spirit of internationalism. The construction achievements of the Soviet people have made a great contribution to Asian peace and world peace. We, the Chinese people, must further learn from the Soviet people so that our construction achievements will also make the same contribution to Asian peace and world peace. We must help our neighbors selflessly and devote ourselves to building our motherland. We must build our motherland into a strong fortress of peace like the Soviet Union. We must accumulate funds continuously for a long time to promote the high tide of economic construction, and constantly practice Marxism-Leninism for a long time to promote the high tide of cultural construction. With solid self-help, there can be better mutual assistance, and with abundant inflow, there can be better exchange. The great unity of the 700 million people of the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union is undoubtedly the strongest guarantee for Asian peace and world peace.
    Long live the ever-developing brotherly friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
    Long live the great unity of peace and democracy forces in Asia and the world!
    Long live the victory of peace!

### 伟大同盟二周年

    伟大同盟二周年
    郭沫若
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的缔结，今天满两周年了。这是一个很值得纪念的日子，我们欢欣鼓舞地对于我们的保卫世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略的伟大同盟，重新表示庆贺。由于同盟条约的缔结，中苏两大民族的兄弟般友谊是更加巩固而扩大了。中苏两大民族七万万人民的团结一致是世界上不可战胜的和平力量。这使世界和平民主阵营受到了很大的鼓舞，更进一步地增加了和帝国主义侵略集团在力量对比上的巨大的优势。
    侵略集团的罪魁，美帝国主义，它的世界侵略政策是把卷起第二次世界大战的轴心国家的政策合而为一的。它在西方承继了希特勒和墨索里尼的传统，在东方接受了日本帝国主义的衣钵，展开它两只贪婪的魔掌向东西两方同时伸出，想把全地球抱进自己的怀里。
    我们中国人民，在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，在伟大无私的苏联人民的友好协助之下，在长期的艰苦斗争中，把日本帝国主义打败了之后，又把美帝国主义所全力支持的蒋介石匪帮的势力从大陆上全部肃清了，使美帝国主义伸向东方的魔掌遭受了沉重的打击。
    但美帝国主义是不肯死心的，是不肯接受教训的。它在中国大陆上失败了，却侵占着我们的台湾，依然支持着蒋介石残余匪帮，死心踏地的和全中国人民为敌。在前年六月美帝国主义竟发动了侵略朝鲜的战争，妄想抄袭日本帝国主义的故技，吞并朝鲜，更进而侵略中国。这一罪恶行动又在英勇的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军并肩作战之下遭受了应得的惩罚，美帝国主义因而被迫接受了朝鲜的停战谈判。但它今天不仅依然在拖延阻挠停战谈判，对于朝鲜问题的和平解决毫无诚意，而在另一方面却更明目张胆地和日本帝国主义的残余分子在侵略行为上勾结起来了。完全与中苏两国人民为敌的旧金山非法“对日和约”和所谓“美日双边安全条约”已经在去年九月缔结，最近美帝国主义又对于它所一手扶植着的日本吉田傀儡政府施以压力，要它和蒋介石残余匪帮结合，吉田傀儡政府也受宠若惊地唯命是听了。这就表明两年前中苏友好同盟互助条约缔结的当时所预见到的可能性已经成为了现实。
    条约是规定得很明白的：缔约国双方要尽力采取一切必要的步骤以防止日本帝国主义之再起或其他直接间接在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的任何国家之重新侵略与破坏和平。日本帝国主义的残余分子在今天正企图再起，而美帝国主义在今天也肆无忌惮地在侵略行为上与日本相勾结，这正是我们伟大的同盟条约所要防止的对象。我们应该感谢毛主席和斯大林大元帅的睿智，在两年前他们便为亚洲和平与世界和平的保卫事业，作了深远的未雨绸缪。条约的重要性和庄严性，在今天是更加明白显著了。
    自从二次大战结束以来，妄想奴役全人类的美帝国主义不断地在增涨着它的嚣张，但这是不是表明它的力量在逐渐加强呢？不是的，恰恰相反！我们在援助朝鲜的正义战争中已经看得很清楚了，美帝国主义是外强中干的，帝国主义侵略集团是矛盾百出的，只要我们和平民主阵营加紧团结，提高警觉，帝国主义的侵略计划和战争政策是可以完全击破的。我们看得很清楚，以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营是在日益削弱了，而和它成对比的，世界和平民主阵营却是日益壮大着。苏联的和平建设已经进到共产主义建设的阶段，中苏两国之间的和一切人民民主国家之间的友谊在与时俱进，全世界被压迫民族反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族解放的烽火已经由远东烧到中东、近东和非洲北部，拉丁美洲的人民也正在加强着反对美帝国主义奴役的斗争。美帝国主义和它的仆从国家们在这样壮大的和平力量之前是愈益张皇失措了。走向没落的势力，愈益感觉着自己的没落，便愈益疯狂地倒行逆施。目前在东方美、日、蒋的相互勾结可以说正是这种倒行逆施的最典型的表现。蒋介石残余匪帮是全中国、全世界的人民所不屑挂齿的，连美国的战争贩子们都说它们是最贪污、最腐化、最无能的一群小丑。而日本帝国主义者几年前在侵略战争中、极端残暴地屠杀中国人民和亚洲人民的往事，在中国人民和亚洲各国人民的记忆中也还新鲜得很。今天美帝国主义左提右抱的把它们当成最宝贵的伙伴相互勾结起来了，它到底希望从这里能产生出什么力量呢？一个人假如左手操纵着一个傀儡、右手操纵着另一个傀儡，死命地和傀儡们相互拥抱起来，难道就会有了三倍的力量吗？美、日、蒋的相互勾结就是这样的一个实际，这只表示着美帝国主义的黔驴技穷而已。
    但是，我们是经常提高着警惕性的。我们中国人民在毛主席的领导之下，对于敌人的力量决不作过高的估计，也决不作过低的估计。对于美日帝国主义的勾结和日本帝国主义之企图再起，毛主席和斯大林大元帅所亲手缔结的中苏友好同盟互助条约，已经在两年前就教我们预为之防了。预防的步骤在条约上是写得很周密的。两年来我们执行条约的状况是怎样呢？我们在充实防止侵略的实力上是有成就的，在共同巩固和平与普遍安全上是有成就的，在发展和巩固两国的经济与文化关系上是有成就的。我们的伟大的同盟条约，两年来得到了中苏两国人民的忠实的实践。我们始终感谢着苏联人民对于我们的大公无私的帮助，而我们在抗美援朝战线上的胜利，在土地改革战线上的胜利，在镇压反革命战线上的胜利，在经济战线、文化战线上的一切胜利应该也就是对于伟大盟友的很好的报答。今天我们要纪念我们的同盟条约两周年，最好的办法也就是更进一步地巩固并扩大我们的胜利。我们要遵守毛主席的指示，厉行增产节约，继续加强抗美援朝的运动，要在新开辟的战线，反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动中争取更伟大的胜利。
    在人民作了主人的国家，一切爱国主义的表现是和国际主义的精神一脉相通的。苏联人民的建设成就对于亚洲和平与世界和平有了很伟大的贡献，我们中国人民要更进一步地学习苏联人民，使我们的建设成就对于亚洲和平与世界和平也具有同样的贡献。我们要无我地帮助邻人，献身地建设祖国。我们要把我们的祖国建设成像苏联一样的坚强的和平堡垒。我们要长期不断地积累资金以促进经济建设的高潮，长期不断地实践马列主义以促进文化建设的高潮，有了坚实的自助便能有更好的互助，有了充沛的本流便能有更好的交流。中苏两大民族七万万人民的大团结，毫无疑问，是亚洲和平和世界和平的最坚强的保障。
    中苏两国人民兄弟般友谊永远发展万岁！
    全亚洲和全世界和平民主力量大团结万岁！
    和平胜利万岁！
