    Contractor Xu Foquan Seriously Exploits Workers in the Beijing People's Swimming Pool Construction Project

    Editor: I once traveled from Beijing to Nanjing on official business. While on the train, I chatted with a fellow worker and learned about a case of serious exploitation of workers by a contractor. I would like to provide this information to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Engineering Bureau for investigation and handling.

    The Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Engineering Bureau contracted out part of the People's Swimming Pool project to the feudal foreman Xu Foquan. Xu Foquan then subcontracted it to Zhou Jinjin, Zhu Jinxiang, Xu Fusheng, and others. The worker I met was working there. He said that Xu Foquan and others received wages from the Public Health Engineering Bureau, but after paying the workers, they made a profit of 40 million yuan, with Xu getting 20 million yuan and the other three dividing 20 million yuan. The workers only received 16,000 yuan per person per day. If we calculate based on 30 workers working for 40 days, the total income of the workers is only 19.2 million yuan.

    If the facts are accurate, I would like to put forward the following suggestions: 1. In a New Democratic society, such large-scale intermediary exploitation cannot be tolerated, and Xu Foquan should be investigated and dealt with according to the law. 2. The work of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Engineering Bureau is rough and lacks in-depth and specific estimates of the actual needs of the project, giving speculators an opportunity to exploit, resulting in a serious waste of state property, and should be reviewed.

    Editor's Note: According to a letter from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Engineering Bureau, they have conducted an inspection based on Liang Nongsun's letter and confirmed that the situation reflected by Liang Nongsun is completely correct. In addition to conducting a review, the Public Health Engineering Bureau has also disciplined the responsible cadres involved in the project. The Public Health Engineering Bureau has filed a lawsuit against Xu Foquan for deceiving the government and seriously exploiting the workers, and the court has arrested Xu Foquan and will bring him to justice.

### 北京人民游泳场修建工程中包工头徐佛泉严重剥削工人

    北京人民游泳场修建工程中包工头徐佛泉严重剥削工人
    编辑同志：我曾因公从北京到南京，在火车上和同座的一个工人闲谈，知道了一件关于包工头严重剥削工人的事情。我愿把这件事提供北京市人民政府卫生工程局调查处理。
    北京市人民政府卫生工程局曾把人民游泳场的一部分工程包给封建把头徐佛泉。徐佛泉又转包给周金金、朱金祥、徐福生等三人。我所遇到的工人就在这里作工。他说，徐佛泉等领到卫生工程局的工资，除发给工人外，竟赚了四千万元，徐得二千万元，其他三人分得二千万元。而工人每日每人才实得一万六千元。如拿三十个工人做四十天工计算，则工人所得总共才一千九百二十万元。
    假使事实确实，我愿提出以下几个意见：一、在新民主主义社会里，不能容许这样大的中饱和剥削，应把徐佛泉查明法办。二、北京市卫生工程局的工作粗枝大叶，对工程的实际需要没有作深入具体的估计，给投机者以可乘之机，造成国家财产的严重浪费，应作检讨。
    梁农荪
    编者按：据北京市人民政府卫生工程局来信说：他们已根据梁农荪的来信作了检查，证明梁农荪所反映的情况是完全正确的。卫生工程局除作了检讨外，并分别处分了有关此项工程的失职干部。卫生工程局对欺骗政府、严重剥削工人的徐佛泉已向法院起诉，法院已把徐佛泉逮捕法办。
