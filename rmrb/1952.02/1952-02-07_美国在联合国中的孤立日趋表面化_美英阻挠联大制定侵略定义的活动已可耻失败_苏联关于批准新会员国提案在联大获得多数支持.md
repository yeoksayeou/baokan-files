Title: The US's Isolation in the United Nations Becomes Increasingly Obvious.

Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: Paris dispatch: At the plenary sessions of the Sixth UN General Assembly on January 31st and February 1st, resolutions on the question of formulating a definition of aggression and approving new member states to join the United Nations were discussed and voted on. The voting results once again showed that the United States' isolation in the United Nations is becoming increasingly obvious, and the US voting machine is becoming less and less effective.

The issue of formulating a definition of aggression had been discussed in the Legal Committee for two weeks. During the discussion, the Soviet delegation firmly advocated unconditionally condemning all acts of aggression and argued that the definition of aggression should eliminate any excuses for justifying aggression. The US and British delegations tried to obstruct the formulation of a definition of aggression and insisted that it was impossible to give a general definition of aggression. As a result, the attempt of the US-British bloc completely failed. In the Legal Committee, despite the opposing votes of the US and British delegations, the delegations of twenty-eight countries (including the Soviet Union) passed a proposal stating that in order to ensure peace and security, it is possible and feasible to define aggression by listing the elements constituting aggression. It is undoubtedly very necessary to formulate instructions regarding the definition of aggression so that certain international organizations in the future have something to follow when identifying aggressors. During the plenary session on January 31st to discuss this proposal, members of the US delegation were still engaging in behind-the-scenes activities before the meeting and after the discussion had already begun, trying to persuade some delegations to support the US position and delete the most important part of the proposal that stated that formulating a definition of aggression is possible and feasible. However, the US's activities were again completely defeated by the voting results. Thirty votes (two more than when passed in the Legal Committee) were in favor of the entire proposal, eight abstained, and only twelve voted against.

Many delegations criticized the US's attitude of trying to obstruct the formulation of a definition of aggression in their speeches before the vote. The Burmese representative said that formulating a definition of aggression is possible, and this will enable the United Nations to take swift action against aggressor countries. He stated that some areas of his country have already been invaded by Kuomintang troops, and people interpret this action in different ways because a definition of aggression has not been formulated. He said: The member states of the United Nations should have demanded that the Kuomintang "government" withdraw its troops from Burma, but because a definition of aggression has not been formulated, they do not feel obliged to take such measures. He also said: They may not care much because it is not their own territory that is being invaded, but the territory of Burma, but the point is that this is an attack on a member of the United Nations. He expressed that he would vote in favor of the proposal that had already been passed by the Legal Committee. Representatives from Mexico, Bolivia, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and Yemen also expressed dissatisfaction with the US delegation's opposition to formulating a definition of aggression.

At the meeting on February 1st, the US's isolation was equally apparent when voting on the Soviet proposal to have the General Assembly recommend that the Security Council reconsider the applications of fourteen countries—Albania, the Mongolian People's Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Finland, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, Transjordan, Austria , Sri Lanka and Nepal as well as Libya—to join the United Nations. It was only by resorting to procedural tricks that the United States was able to get the General Assembly to reject the Soviet proposal. The Soviet proposal had previously been voted on in the Political Committee, where it was passed with a majority of votes. At that time, even the United States' Associated Press had to admit that this was "a major victory for the Soviet Union over the United States." Therefore, the US delegation tried every means to obstruct the passage of the Soviet proposal in the General Assembly plenary session, in order to obstruct the resolution of the issue of approving the simultaneous accession of the fourteen applicant countries to the United Nations. On the one hand, it put pressure on some delegations in an attempt to force them to abandon their support for the Soviet proposal. On the other hand, it also played tricks on procedural issues. Although the Soviet proposal contained procedural recommendations, according to the UN Charter and rules of procedure, it could be passed with a two-thirds majority of the delegations participating in the vote. However, the United States forced the General Assembly to make an illegal decision that the Soviet proposal must obtain a two-thirds majority vote to pass. Nevertheless, when the General Assembly finally voted on this proposal, there were twenty-two votes (one more than in the Political Committee vote) in favor of the Soviet proposal, twenty-one votes against, and sixteen delegations abstained. Therefore, the Soviet proposal also received a majority vote in the plenary session, but failed to pass due to the US's conspiracy. Even the Associated Press believed that this "victory" of the United States could not change the fact that a majority of delegations supported the Soviet Union's position on this issue and did not support the United States' opposition. A dispatch from Paris on the 1st of the agency said: "Despite the victory of the United States, an increasing number of people here believe that the United States will eventually be forced to abandon its firm opposition to the method of approving the simultaneous accession of all applicant countries to the United Nations."

In the consecutive days of meetings of the UN General Assembly, it can be seen that the US's attempt to turn the majority of member states into small gears in the voting machine for passing its aggressive policies has begun to fail. An increasing number of countries in the United Nations are no longer willing to support the United States' willful actions.

### 美国在联合国中的孤立日趋表面化  美英阻挠联大制定侵略定义的活动已可耻失败  苏联关于批准新会员国提案在联大获得多数支持

    美国在联合国中的孤立日趋表面化
    美英阻挠联大制定侵略定义的活动已可耻失败
    苏联关于批准新会员国提案在联大获得多数支持
    【新华社六日讯】巴黎消息：联合国第六届大会在一月三十一日和二月一日的全体会议上，讨论和表决了关于制定侵略定义问题和批准新会员国加入联合国问题的议案。表决结果再一次地表明了美国在联合国中的孤立已日趋表面化，美国的表决机器已经越来越不灵了。
    关于制定侵略定义的问题，已经在法律委员会上讨论过两个星期，在讨论中，苏联代表团坚决主张无条件地谴责一切侵略行为，主张侵略的定义应消除任何为侵略辩解的藉口；美、英代表团则力图阻挠制定侵略的定义，并且硬说不可能对侵略下一个一般的定义，结果美英集团的企图完全失败了。在法律委员会上，虽然有美英代表团的投票反对，二十八个国家（包括苏联）的代表团通过了一项提案，其中说，为了保障和平和安全，列举构成侵略的要素而确定侵略的定义，是可能而且可行的，而制定关于侵略定义方面的指示，以便未来某些国际机构在判明侵略者的身份时有所遵循，更无疑地是很需要的。在一月三十一日全体会议讨论这项提案时，美国代表团的团员们一直到开会前和讨论已经开始以后，还在进行幕后活动，企图说服一些代表团支持美国的立场，删去提案中的称制定侵略定义是可能的而且可行的这个最重要的部分，但是投票结果，美国的活动又遭到了完全的失败。有三十票（比在法律委员会通过时还多两票）赞成整个的提案，八票弃权，只有十二票反对。
    许多代表团在表决以前的发言中，都批评了美国企图阻挠制定侵略定义的态度。缅甸代表说，制定侵略定义是可能的，这将使联合国能够采取迅速行动以反对侵略国家。他声明说，目前他的国家的某些地区已被国民党的军队侵入，有人用种种不同的方式来解释这种行动，因为侵略的定义还没有制定出来。他说：联合国各会员国本来应该要求国民党“政府”把它的军队撤出缅甸，然而由于没有制定侵略的定义，它们就不觉得理应采取这样的措施。他又说：它们也许是不怎么关心吧，因为被侵略的不是它们自己的领土，而是缅甸的领土，但是问题的要点在于这是对联合国的一个会员国的进攻。他表示将投票赞成法律委员会所已经通过的提案。墨西哥、玻利维亚、埃及、叙利亚、黎巴嫩和也门的代表，也对美国代表团反对制定侵略定义的态度表示不满。
    在二月一日的会议上，在表决苏联所提出的关于由大会建议安全理事会重新考虑阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、芬兰、意大利、葡萄牙、爱尔兰、外约旦、奥地利、锡兰和尼泊尔以及利比亚等十四国加入联合国的问题的提案时，美国的孤立也同样地明显，它仅仅依靠了玩弄程序的花样，才使大会否决了苏联的提案。苏联提案前在政治委员会中进行表决时，已经获得多数票的支持而通过。当时，甚至美国的合众社也不得不承认，这是“苏联对美国的重大胜利”。因此，美国代表团就想尽一切办法企图阻挠在大会全体会议上通过苏联提案，以阻挠解决批准十四个申请国同时加入联合国的问题。它一方面对若干代表团施以压力，企图强使它们放弃支持苏联的提案，另一方面还在程序问题上玩弄花样，虽然苏联提案包含的是程序性的建议，按照联合国宪章和程序规则，获得参加投票的代表团的二分之一多数票就可以通过，但是，美国却强使大会作出了苏联提案必须得到三分之二多数票始能通过的非法决定。尽管如此，大会最后在对这项提案表决时，还有二十二票（比在政治委员会表决时还多一票）赞成苏联提案，二十一票反对，十六个代表团弃权。因此，苏联提案在全体会议上也获得了多数票的支持，只是由于美国的阴谋而未能通过。甚至合众社也认为，美国的这种“胜利”是不能转变多数的代表团支持苏联在这个问题上的主张而不支持美国的反对的事实的。该社巴黎一日电说：“尽管美国获得胜利，但是此间愈来愈多的人认为，美国最后终将被迫放弃对批准所有申请国同时加入联合国的办法的坚决反对态度。”
    在联合国大会连日的会议上，可以看出，美国企图把大多数会员国变为通过它的侵略政策的表决机器中的小齿轮的手段，已经开始破产了，联合国中愈来愈多的国家已经不愿意支持美国这种一意孤行的胡作非为了。
