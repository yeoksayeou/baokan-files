Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: The Japanese Communist Party's Provisional Central Guidance Department, in order to demand the dissolution of the traitorous Diet that has become a tool of the Yoshida government and to hold a general election, and to establish a national liberation democratic government, issued a "Message to the Compatriots of the Nation for the Upcoming General Election" in January. In this document, the Japanese Communist Party explained to the people of the country the serious situation Japan is currently in and put forward an anti-imperialist patriotic united election program.

The Japanese Communist Party pointed out to the people of the country: Japan, the motherland with thousands of years of history, has become a colony of the United States for the first time in its history. American imperialism and the Yoshida government are trying to make Japan a tool for their aggression against China and the Soviet Union. However, this conspiracy of theirs is encountering major difficulties. The two war treaties they signed in San Francisco have aroused great indignation among the Japanese people. The struggle of the Japanese working class and others demanding the abolition of traitorous treaties, opposing rearmament, and overthrowing the Yoshida cabinet is growing stronger day by day. As American imperialism becomes increasingly isolated due to its failure to invade Korea and the rise of the global peace movement, it is increasingly trying to collude with the Japanese reactionary forces represented by Yoshida to rearm Japan and prepare for expanding aggression in Asia. Therefore, it has revived fascist rule in Japan. However, the result is a further upsurge in the anti-American, anti-Yoshida struggle of the entire Japanese nation. The Japanese Communist Party has always stood at the forefront of this patriotic movement, carrying out a heroic struggle and striving to guide the Japanese nation to independence and peace victoriously.

Then, the Japanese Communist Party put forward the anti-imperialist patriotic united election program to all patriotic parties and patriotic people, which is as follows:

(1) Oppose the separate peace treaty, oppose the Japan-US Security Treaty, and fully implement the Potsdam Proclamation.

(2) Conclude a comprehensive peace treaty including China and the Soviet Union, and conclude a peace pact among the five major powers.

(3) Oppose rearmament, oppose turning Japanese people into mercenaries, remove military bases, and withdraw all occupying forces.

(4) Establish free, equal, and mutually beneficial trade relations with all countries.

(5) Grant freedom to all patriotic peace movements, oppose the "Regulations on Organizations, etc.," and other fascist legislation, oppose revising the inferior constitution, and oppose suppressing other nationalities in Japan.

(6) Eliminate corruption, improve people's lives, abolish heavy taxes levied due to the war, lower prices, and defend national culture and education.

(7) Give land to working peasants, oppose feudal exploitation and oppression of farmers and fishermen, oppose land seizure, oppose compulsory purchases, stipulate reasonable prices for agricultural products, and provide farmers and fishermen with necessary funds.

(8) Implement an eight-hour work system, oppose unemployment and increased labor intensity, provide wages sufficient to maintain life, and establish a complete social insurance system.

(9) Freely develop peaceful and national industries, oppose wartime economic control, and guarantee entrepreneurs and merchants access to funds, materials, electricity, and markets.

(10) Overthrow the traitorous Liberal Party government and establish a national liberation united government.

    日共提出反帝爱国统一选举纲领
    号召一切爱国党派爱国人民反对卖国条约
    打倒吉田反动政府建立民族解放联合政府
    【新华社二十日讯】日本共产党临时中央指导部，为要求解散已成为吉田政府的工具的卖国国会、举行全国大选，为建立民族解放民主政府，于一月发表了“为即将到来的总选举告全国同胞书”。在这一文件中，日本共产党向全国国民说明了日本当前所处的严重形势，并提出了反帝爱国统一选举纲领。
    日本共产党向全国国民指出：拥有数千年历史的祖国日本，今天已有史以来第一次沦为美国的殖民地。美帝国主义与吉田政府，力图使日本成为其侵略中国与苏联的工具。然而他们这一阴谋正遭受重大困难。他们在旧金山签订的两项战争条约，引起了日本民族的极大义愤。日本以工人阶级为首的要求废除卖国条约、反对重新武装与打倒吉田内阁的斗争，正日益壮大着。当美帝国主义因侵略朝鲜失败与全世界和平运动高涨而愈益趋于孤立的时候，它也就愈想勾结以吉田为代表的日本反动势力，重新武装日本，为在亚洲扩大侵略进行准备。因此，它在日本重新复活了法西斯统治。然而结果却是日本全民族反美、反吉田斗争的进一步高涨。日本共产党始终站在这一爱国运动的最前列，进行了英勇的斗争，并为胜利地引导日本民族走向独立与和平而奋斗。
    接着日本共产党向一切爱国党派、爱国人士提出了反帝爱国统一选举纲领，内容如下：
    （一）反对单独和约，反对日美安全条约，完全实施波茨坦公告。
    （二）缔结包括中国、苏联的全面和约，缔结五大国和平公约。
    （三）反对重新武装，反对把日本人变为雇佣兵，撤除军事基地，撤退全部占领军。
    （四）与一切国家建立自由、平等、互惠的贸易关系。
    （五）给与一切爱国和平运动以自由，反对“团体等规正法”及其他法西斯立法，反对改劣宪法，反对镇压在日其他民族。
    （六）肃清贪污腐化，改善国民生活，废止因战争而征收的重税，压低物价，保卫民族文化与教育。
    （七）给劳动的农民以土地，反对对农民、渔民的封建剥削与压迫，反对夺地，反对强制征购，规定合理的农产物价格，贷给农民、渔民以必要的资金。
    （八）实行八小时劳动制，反对失业与提高劳动强度，给予足以维持生活的工资，确立完全的社会保险制度。
    （九）自由发展和平工业与民族工业，反对战时经济统制，保障企业家与商人获得资金、资材、电力与市场。
    （十）打倒卖国的自由党政府，建立民族解放联合政府。
