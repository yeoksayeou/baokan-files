The People's Bank of China Tianjin Branch and its directly affiliated units, starting from January 20th, have concentrated their efforts to encircle and suppress major embezzlers. As of the 6th, they have successively uncovered twenty major embezzlers who exploited their positions to defraud public funds, steal national economic secrets, and embezzle more than 100 million yuan, as well as those with serious circumstances. Thirteen of these individuals have been arrested and brought to justice by the People's Court for refusing to confess; the remaining major embezzlers are being further encouraged to thoroughly confess their crimes.

The vast majority of the thirteen major embezzlers who have been arrested are retained personnel who have not been properly reformed and new personnel who have entered the bank after liberation. These major embezzlers are either spies sent by illegal merchants or traitors who have been bought off. They are all bloodsuckers of the bourgeoisie inserted into the national bank. Preliminary analysis indicates that these embezzlers use their positions to carry out illegal activities in the following three ways:

(1) Large-scale defrauding of public funds: For example, Wu Shuchen, a business field worker at the Jiefang Nanlu Office, entered the People's Bank in March of last year. In June of last year, Wu's father, Wu Yusheng, and his uncle, Li Shoupeng (both of whom have been arrested), rented a warehouse on Yantai Road in the Tenth District to open a Linmao horsehair and wool processing factory, and established a business relationship with the Jiefang Nanlu Office. This factory had a capital of only four million yuan, but through Wu Shuchen, a traitor they sent in, they deceived the leaders of this office by forging credit investigation forms, and defrauded the state of 850 million yuan in loans within half a year. In July of last year, they obtained a floating pledge loan of 420 million yuan, which was more than 100 times the factory's capital, causing significant losses to state funds. Another example is that illegal merchants like Shen Erchang of Taifeng Trading Company had neither working capital nor collateral for loans when they started their business. Later, they bribed Cai Bingheng and Zhao Xuegong, employees of the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China, and defrauded the state of 29 billion yuan in loans to engage in illegal business, allowing them to "start from scratch." Cai and Zhao exploited their positions to sell out national interests, accepting bribes of more than 200 million yuan from Shen Erchang and more than 20 other trading companies.

(2) Leaking national economic secrets: Guo Shijun and Ni Bangkui of the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China are themselves illegal merchants. One is the supervisor of Huilong Company; the other is a shareholder of Minxin Trading Company. They often leak foreign trade secrets to the trading companies they operate, causing significant losses to state property. For example, when Ni Bangkui heard that the exchange rate was about to be adjusted, he leaked it to the illegal merchants who colluded with him, urging them to quickly settle foreign exchange; another example is that when the scope of barter trade was reduced in 1949, Ni informed illegal merchants of Minxin, Xinzhong and other trading companies in advance, telling them to quickly apply for barter permits, which affected the implementation of the foreign trade policy at that time.

(3) Stealing public funds and operating underground money houses jointly with illegal merchants: For example, Wu Beizhang, a business field worker at the Jiefang Nanlu Office of the bank, withheld fixed deposit savings he had collected, failed to report them to the bank, and gave them to illegal merchants such as Li Xinming (manager of Tianjin Renji Western Goods Store) to operate underground money houses, totaling 230 million yuan.

The discovery of these major embezzlers not only exposes the serious bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres of the People's Bank of China Tianjin Branch, but also provides a good lesson for those leaders who hold purely technical viewpoints. The fact that Ni Bangkui and Guo Shijun of the Tianjin Branch of the Bank of China were retained personnel who were still appointed as section chiefs and held important positions for a long time after liberation, stealing economic intelligence, is a good proof of the bureaucratic style and the sole emphasis on their professional skills by the leading cadres of the bank.

    人民银行天津分行查获二十名大贪污犯
    各犯利用职权骗取公款泄漏机密罪行重大
    中国人民银行天津分行和各直属单位，自一月二十日起开始集中火力，围剿大贪污犯。截至六日，已先后查出利用职权骗取公款，盗窃国家经济机密，贪污一亿元以上的以及情节重大的大贪污犯达二十名，其中十三名因拒不坦白，已由人民法院逮捕法办；对其余的大贪污犯，正继续动员他们彻底坦白交代问题。
    已经被捕的十三名大贪污犯，绝大多数都是未经很好改造的留用人员和解放后打入银行工作的新人员。这些大贪污犯，或是不法商人派进来的坐探，或是被收买拉过去的奸细，他们都是资产阶级插到国家银行内的吸血管。这些贪污犯利用职权进行违法活动的方式，据初步分析有以下三点：
    （一）大量骗取公款：如解放南路办事处业务外勤吴树柽，去年三月间考入人民银行；去年六月间，吴的父亲吴禹生和他的舅父李寿彭（均已被捕）等，在十区烟台道借了一个货栈的地方开设麟贸马尾绒毛加工厂，并和解放南路办事处建立了往来关系。这个厂仅有资本四百万元，但是通过他们派进来的奸细吴树柽，用伪造征信调查表的手段，欺瞒这个办事处领导人，半年内就骗取了国家贷款八亿五千万元。去年七月份，得到一笔流动质押放款四亿二千万元，超过这个厂的资本一百多倍。使国家资金遭受很大损失。又如奸商泰丰贸易行沈尔昌等，开始营业时，既没有流动资金，也没有贷款的抵押品，后来收买了中国银行天津分行的职员蔡秉衡、赵学恭等，先后骗取国家贷款达二百九十亿元，从事非法经营，得以“白手起家”。蔡、赵两犯利用职权，出卖国家利益，从中接受沈尔昌和其他二十多家贸易商的贿赂达两亿元以上。
    （二）泄露国家经济机密：中国银行天津分行的郭士钧和倪邦逵，本身就是奸商。一个是惠隆行的监理；一个是敏信贸易行的股东。他们经常把对外贸易机密泄露给自己经营的贸易行，使国家财产遭受很大的损失。如倪邦逵在听到外汇牌价要调整时，就泄露给和他勾结的奸商，让他们赶快来结汇；又如一九四九年对外贸易缩小易货范围时，倪犯事先告诉给敏信、辛中等贸易行的奸商，叫他们赶快申请易货许可，以致影响当时对外贸易政策的贯彻执行。
    （三）盗窃公款与奸商共同经营地下钱庄：如该行解放南路办事处业务外勤吴北章，扣押收揽来的定期储蓄存款，不向行里报账，而给奸商李新铭（天津仁记西栈经理）等经营地下钱庄，先后达二亿三千万元。
    这些大贪污犯的发现，除暴露了人民银行天津分行领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风以外，也给那些抱有单纯技术观点的领导人一个很好的教训。中国银行天津分行倪邦逵、郭士钧为留用人员，在解放后仍被任为科长，长期窃居要职，偷窃经济情报，就是该行领导干部的官僚主义和单纯重视他们业务技术的一个很好的证明。
