How a Gang of Unlawful Capitalists Inserted a Straw into the China Pharmaceutical Company's Jilin Provincial Branch
　　Chang Chensheng

　　Four years ago, Sun Xun, the manager of the private Changchun Huanqiu Pharmacy, abandoned his "sure-profit" business and traveled two hundred and forty miles to "apply" to the Jilin Provincial People's Government Health Department. He solemnly expressed his "patriotic" enthusiasm and his determination to "serve the people," begging the government to keep him, saying "any kind of work will do," appearing truly "heartfelt and utterly sincere." Two years later, this "capable" Mr. Sun became the manager of the China Pharmaceutical Company's Jilin Provincial Branch. "To develop the business," he "united" with two friends "enthusiastic about public health": one was Wang Chenyuan, the manager of the private Jilin Chunming Pharmaceutical Factory; the other was Liu Yutian, the owner of Weiersi Pharmacy. These two enthusiastic friends sent an electric meter on the day the company was established to celebrate the "grand opening." Subsequently, they often brought fruits, pears, peaches, chickens, ducks, fish, meat, foreign wines, canned goods, and even cash and watches to help company personnel "adjust their appetites" and "solve their living difficulties." Later, they became even more "caring." They often abandoned their own businesses to prepare houses and arrange furniture for the families of company employees, and accompany them on "relaxing outings." And that's not all, they also helped the company find a "loyal and reliable" shop assistant, Jia Baogui; when the company was "short-handed," boss Wang Chenyuan could even put aside half a day of business to "take care of" the company's warehouse and market management, acting as a "part-time, part-salary" "cadre" in the company. The true faces of these "kind-hearted" fellows' actions have been revealed in the angry tide of the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle: all of this was actually a scam they set up to steal state property!

　　For more than two years, the unscrupulous merchants Sun Xun, Wang Chenyuan, and Liu Yutian, relied on this scam to become the managers of the China Pharmaceutical Company's Jilin Provincial Branch, turning the state institution used to develop people's health into a tool for them to steal state property and make a fortune; for more than two years, they controlled the pharmaceutical company, sucking the people's blood and sweat, becoming bloated, disgusting parasites. In this shameful conspiracy, the three unscrupulous merchants divided the work and cooperated, each with their own tricks.

　　Take the Chunming Pharmaceutical Factory, for example. It frequently occupied state funds through Sun Xun. On one occasion, he took away 300 million yuan worth of medicinal materials on credit to engage in speculation and profiteering, only repaying the company three months later. In addition to occupying state funds, Wang Chenyuan also openly defrauded state property and stole company assets. With the collusion of Sun Xun, Jia Baogui, and others, the unscrupulous merchant Wang Chenyuan used large quantities of deteriorated waste medicine to obtain state money. Especially in November 1950, when the Korean front needed a large quantity of cough syrup, the black-hearted thief Wang Chenyuan, Sun Xun, and others were so vicious and inhuman that they sent eight hundred pounds of already-sedimented cough syrup to the front line, defrauding 140 million yuan in cash from it. Wang Chenyuan also openly said: "It doesn't matter, this batch of medicine is like a meat bun thrown to a dog, gone and never coming back." This is how they treated the heroes who defended our motherland with their blood and flesh! This group of profit-seeking merchants has become the enemy of the people! Sometimes, Wang Chenyuan found fraud troublesome, so he simply stretched out his thieving hand and, through the former warehouse负责人 Li Shuming, stole medicines and materials, and also stole a book of the pharmaceutical company's delivery notes (about fifty sheets) stamped with all the seals, to evade state taxes and to promote the sale of waste medicine under the guise of the pharmaceutical company. In this way, the pharmaceutical company became Wang Chenyuan's "obligatory promotion station" and "treasury." More than 80% of the products of the notorious Chunming Pharmaceutical Factory were pushed into the pharmaceutical company; a large amount of state funds flowed into Wang Chenyuan's pocket. The product quality of Chunming Pharmaceutical Factory was very poor, greatly damaging the reputation of the pharmaceutical company. Because after using the "glucose" produced by Chunming Pharmaceutical Factory, patients trembled non-stop, and many units, such as Dunhua and Jiaohe Forestry Bureaus, and Jilin Maternal and Child Health Station, questioned the pharmaceutical company. In 1950 and 1951, Wang Chenyuan used a large amount of white sugar to manufacture "glucose" for sale in society, defrauding money; and he seriously illegally used opium to make morphine for secret sale. To prove Wang Chenyuan's criminal behavior, it is necessary to mention his background. In the spring of 1949, Wang Chenyuan was just a medicine peddler borrowing a two-square-meter space in the "Dusheng Tang" pharmacy on Henan Street, Jilin City, to set up a medicine stall. But since colluding with Sun Xun, he started a pharmaceutical factory in a grand and swaggering manner in just over a year.

　　To understand the conspiracy of these three unscrupulous merchants, we should also look at the activities of economic traitor Jia Baogui. This guy was known in the company for his "empty talk" and "sycophancy"; another strength was that he often made mistakes with medicines and medical instruments. He could write "rib scissors" as "oral scissors." But four months after he arrived at the company, he was "promoted" by Sun Xun to become the warehouse director and head of the business department, because he was a loyal lackey to the unscrupulous merchants' theft group. Since July of the year before last, for a year and a half, the unscrupulous merchants inserted straws into the vital parts of the company. They first instructed Jia Baogui to lower the price of medicines, which Liu Yutian, Wang Chenyuan, and others then came forward to "buy"; when the medicine was in short supply, the company would then "buy back" at a high price, defrauding a large amount of state wealth in the process. These audacious and law-defying thieves dared to even casually buy up streptomycin, which the state specially controlled to take care of the masses. The state stipulates that those who hold a doctor's referral letter can only buy one at a time, but Jia Baogui "sold" forty streptomycin to Liu Yutian in one go, and at more than half the price it should have been sold for. The amount of morphine and other drugs they illegally sold was too much to calculate. When the unscrupulous merchants were at their most rampant, they even instructed the traitor Jia Baogui to suppress the medicines allocated by the Northeast Branch of the China Pharmaceutical Company, first labeling them as "products of Chunming Pharmaceutical Factory." They even openly pointed at Jia Baogui's nose and scolded him: "Have you forgotten your roots, you son of a bitch?"

　　More seriously, this group of unscrupulous merchants continued to oppose the motherland and the people after the anti-corruption movement was launched, forming a "chain-style" "alliance of defense." While Sun Xun openly resisted the movement, Jia Baogui was ordered to instigate the comrades in the warehouse department to "open fire on the sales department and suppress them." In particular, the unscrupulous merchant Wang Chenyuan not only continued to enter and exit the company's warehouse after the movement was launched, collecting economic intelligence, but even threatened those who confessed and reformed in the company in an extremely rude manner. When salesman Zhou Shanming confessed to materials about embezzlement, bribery, and theft of state property, Wang Chenyuan dragged Zhou Shanming into an alley on the night of February 4th, probing for information and threatening him in every possible way, driving Zhou Shanming to his death.

　　The thieves' shameful road has come to an end; the people will never allow the thieves to harm the people and destroy the motherland again! The iron fists of the people have fallen on the thieves' heads!

    一伙不法资本家怎样把吸血管插进了中国医药公司吉林省公司
    常辰生
    四年前，私营长春环球药房的经理孙逊，丢下了“一本万利”的买卖，风尘仆仆地跑了二百四十里路，赶到吉林省人民政府卫生厅“投考”。他一本正经地表白他的“爱国”热情，表白他“为人民服务”的决心，央告政府留下他，“干点什么工作都成”，真有点“热血沸腾，耿耿此心”的样子。过了两年，这位“能干”的先生当上了中国医药公司吉林省公司的经理。“为了发展业务”，他“团结”了两位“热心卫生事业”的朋友：一位叫王忱元，是吉林市私营春明制药厂的经理；一位叫刘雨田，是维尔西药店的老板。这两位热心朋友，在公司成立当天就送来电表一块，庆贺“开幕之禧”。随后，就常常拿来瓜果梨桃、鸡鸭鱼肉、洋酒罐头甚至钞票、手表，帮助公司人员“调剂胃口”、“解决生活困难”。后来，就更加“照顾”得周到了。他们二位常常撂下自己的买卖，给公司职员的家属预备房子，安排家具，陪公司职员出去“散心”。这还不算，他们还帮助公司找了一位“忠实可靠”的店员贾宝贵；公司“人手不足”的时候，王忱元老板更可以放下半天生意，“兼顾”公司仓库和行情的管理，在公司里充当“半职半薪”的“干部”。这些“好心肠”的家伙们的所作所为，在反贪污反盗窃斗争的怒潮中被冲刷出了真实的面目：这一切，原来都是他们为了盗骗国家财产所设的一个骗局！
    奸商孙逊、王忱元、刘雨田，两年多以来，就是靠着这个骗局成了中国医药公司吉林省公司的管理者，把国家用来发展人民卫生事业的机关，变成了他们偷盗国家财产、大发横财的工具；两年多来，他们把持着医药公司，吸吮人民的血汗，成了臃肿的大臭虫。在这个可耻的阴谋里，三个奸商分工合作，各有各的骗术。
    拿春明制药厂来说，经常通过孙逊占用国家资金。有一次他就赊走了价值三亿元的药料，做投机倒把的勾当，直到三个月后才偿还公司。除了占用国家的资金外，王忱元还公开骗取国家财产，偷盗公司的资财。在孙逊、贾宝贵等人合谋之下，奸商王忱元用大批变质的废药套取国家钱财。特别是一九五○年十一月，朝鲜前线需要大批止咳精，黑心贼王忱元、孙逊等，竟毒辣到丧失人性的程度，把八百磅已经发生沉淀的止咳精送上了前线，从中骗得现款一亿四千万元。王忱元还公开地说：“没关系，这批药反正是肉包子打狗，有去无回。”他们就是这样对待那些用血肉守卫我们祖国的英雄们！这群唯利是图的奸商们已经成为人民的公敌！有时候，王忱元嫌诈骗麻烦，就干脆伸出贼手，通过前仓库负责人李书铭偷出药品、材料，并偷出了一本盖有全部印章的医药公司的发货票（约五十张），用来偷漏国税，用来打着医药公司的招牌推销废药。这样，医药公司就成了王忱元的“义务推销站”和“金库”。臭名远扬的春明制药厂的出品，百分之八十以上都推进了医药公司；国家的大批资金都流进了王忱元的皮包。春明制药厂的产品质量十分低劣，大大破坏了医药公司的信誉。因为用了春明制药厂出的“葡萄糖”后，病人发抖不止，向医药公司质问的就有敦化、蛟河林务局、吉林妇婴保健站等许多单位。王忱元在一九五○年和一九五一年曾用白糖大量制造“葡萄糖”，在社会上出售，骗取钱财；并且严重违法私用大烟造吗啡暗中出售。为了证明王忱元的犯罪行为，还要提一下他的根底。一九四九年春天，王忱元只不过是一个借用吉林市河南街“渡生堂”药房里一块两公尺见方的地方，摆一个药摊的药贩子。可是自从和孙逊合谋以后，一年多工夫就大摆大摇地开起制药厂来了。
    为了弄清这三个奸商的阴谋，还应该看一看经济内奸贾宝贵的活动。这个家伙在公司里以“虚头八脑”“溜须拍马”出名；另外的长处，就是常常把药品、医疗器具弄错，他可以把“肋骨剪子”写作“内服剪子”。可是他到公司以后四个月，就被孙逊“提拔”当上了仓库主任、营业部负责人，因为他对于奸商盗窃集团是忠实的走狗。奸商们自前年七月起一年半来，把吸血管插遍了公司的要害。他们首先指使贾宝贵把药价作低，由刘雨田、王忱元等出面“买去”；等到药缺时，再由公司用高价“买回”，转手之间就骗去国家大批财富。这些胆大妄为、藐视国法的盗贼们竟敢连国家为照顾群众特别控制的连霉素，也随便套买。国家规定持有医师介绍信的，每次只能买一支，但贾宝贵只一次就“卖”给刘雨田连霉素四十支，而且比应售价格便宜一半还多。他们非法卖出的吗啡等，更多到无法计算。奸商们最疯狂的时候，竟指使内奸贾宝贵压下中国医药公司东北区公司拨来的药品，先批上“春明药厂出品”。他们甚至公开地指着贾宝贵的鼻梁叫骂斥责：“你他妈的忘本了？”
    更严重的是，这群奸商在反贪污运动开展后，继续和祖国人民为仇作对，订立“连环式”的“攻守同盟”。在孙逊公开抗拒运动同时，贾宝贵就奉命挑拨仓库部的同志“向门市部开火，把他们压下去”。特别是奸商王忱元，不但在运动开展后继续进出公司仓库，收集经济情报，甚至竟极端蛮横地威胁公司里坦白自新的人。当营业员周善铭坦白了贪污、受贿盗窃国家财产的材料后，王忱元在二月四日黑夜把周善铭扯进小胡同里，探听情况，百般威吓，逼死了周善铭。
    盗贼们可耻的道路已经走绝了；人民决不允许盗贼们再危害人民，破坏祖国！人民的铁拳已经落在盗贼们的头上了！
