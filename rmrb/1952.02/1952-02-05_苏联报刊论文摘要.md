Soviet Newspaper Article Abstracts

    Editor's Note: In order to enable our readers to learn more about the various important articles published in major Soviet newspapers and periodicals in a timely manner, in addition to continuing to publish lengthy articles on this subject in this newspaper, we have decided to open a new column here entitled "Abstracts of Soviet Newspaper Articles." As for reports reflecting the specific circumstances of the Soviet people's lives in various aspects in the Soviet newspapers, they will be published in the "Life in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries" column.

    On the Struggle Between the New and the Old
    Soviet Pravda readers Baranov, Kamenev, Polischuk, and others, requested Pravda to answer the question of the manifestations of the struggle between the new and the old in Soviet socialist society. On January 8th, Pravda published a lengthy article by Vishnyakov, answering this question. The abstract is as follows:

    Marxism-Leninism teaches that the struggle between opposites, the struggle between the new and the old, the struggle between the dying and the nascent, constitutes the foundation of the development of nature and society. Social life is in a state of constant motion and development. In social life, there always exist the new and the old, the growing and the dying.

    The struggle between the new and the old is a law inherent in all socio-economic institutions, and it has its own specific manifestations under specific historical conditions.

    In bourgeois society, which is divided into hostile classes, the struggle between the new and the old is primarily manifested in the fierce conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. In this struggle, the working class is the destroyer of the old exploitative system and the creator of the new socialist system.

    Socialist society has new laws of development. In the Soviet Union, there are new driving forces for social development: the unity of social morality and politics, the friendship between all nationalities, and the vibrant Soviet patriotism. These driving forces are steadily growing stronger and consolidating.

    In socialist society, the struggle between the new and the old, which is also the development from the lower to the higher, is carried out through criticism and self-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism are the real driving force of our development and a powerful tool in the hands of the Party. With the help of Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, the Party exposes and eradicates shortcomings in work, ensuring the successful construction of a communist society.

    In the process of the development of socialist society, the growth of new things and the death of old things occur in all aspects of the economy and culture. In our society, the overcoming of the old and backward and the victory of the new and advanced are not achieved spontaneously or left to take their own course, but are the result of the Party and the Soviet government's extensive organizational work and their vigorous support for new things.

    In the struggle for the new and progressive, Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism play a major role. The Party resolutely supports and promotes criticism from below—criticism from workers, collective farm peasants, and Soviet intellectuals—because this criticism embodies the enormous construction experience of millions of working people.

    The characteristic of the Soviet people is to treat socialist public property with a master's attitude of care. The Party educates the Soviet people to treat those who steal the people's property and waste state resources with an uncompromising spirit. Our people place the interests of the Soviet state above everything else. They selflessly labor for the prosperity of the socialist motherland.

    The struggle between the new and the old is manifested in all aspects of social life. It is manifested not only in the economic aspect but also in the fields of thought, science, literature, and art.

    In the Soviet Union, socialist life determines the consciousness of the Soviet people. However, remnants of capitalism still remain in the consciousness of some Soviet people. In addition, capitalist encirclement still exists, and this encirclement is still trying to revive and support the remnants of the past in our people's consciousness.

    The Bolshevik Party is carrying out a tremendous task of communist education for the workers. It resolutely attacks the remnants of capitalism in people's consciousness. Communism cannot be built unless the remnants of capitalism in our people's consciousness are completely eliminated. The Party of Lenin and Stalin is solving one of the major tasks of communist construction through extensive ideological work and political education among the masses. Under the current conditions, the communist education of the working people is of decisive significance. Improving the communist consciousness of the masses can promote our successful overcoming of all old and outdated things and accelerate our progress towards communism.

    Look to the Future More Boldly
    The Soviet Teachers' Gazette published an article on January 19th by Romanchenko and Razdorizki on the creation of science stories. The abstract is as follows:

    In recent years, Soviet science stories have been enriched by the emergence of some new works. The excellent works written by the authors of our science stories have essentially acquired new characteristics. These books are interesting because they profoundly raise scientific and technological questions and strive to reveal the greatness of human wisdom. The characteristics of these works are that they have basic knowledge of modern science, the ability to foresee the path of scientific development, and at the same time, the spirit of true Soviet patriotism. In these books, young readers can discover vivid, fighting, and victorious characters.

    However, in general, this important department of children's literature still cannot meet the growing demands of young readers. The circle of writers engaged in creating science stories is very narrow, and the general ideological, scientific, and artistic level of most works is still insufficient. The themes of these books are limited, the plots and structures are monotonous, and they are often repetitive.

    Our writers have not paid enough attention to the leapfrog development of Soviet science, and have not studied the new problems that are constantly arising before them. Their "hypothetical" predictions and speculations sometimes leave them behind modern scientific thought. Science fiction should not only attract readers with the clarity of its structure but also with the facts of progressive inventions that it publicizes.

    Under our realistic conditions, what is needed are science story books that have a truly imposing, courageous, and brave spirit based on a deep understanding of scientific ideas; and character images that will be remembered forever.

    There is no doubt that science stories can and should have the characteristics of being easily accepted and fascinating. Authors engaged in this type of writing must not disregard the clarity of the plot and the strength of the narrative, nor should they disregard those characteristics possessed by the best images in adventure stories.

    It is very necessary to maintain close and regular contact between science story authors and Soviet scientists. In addition, expanding the scope of writers is of great significance for overcoming the backwardness in science stories. Therefore, young writers should be boldly selected, and scientists should be attracted to participate in the creation of science stories in person.

    Should science story authors describe the near future, specific problems, and scientific topics, or should they talk about the most distant future? Science stories should have both types of works.

专栏：苏联报刊论文摘要

    苏联报刊论文摘要
    编者按：为了使我国读者能及时地更多了解苏联各主要报纸、刊物上所发表的各种重要论文，除在本报继续经常刊登这一方面的长篇文章以外，我们决定在这里另辟“苏联报刊论文摘要”专栏。至于苏联报刊上反映苏联人民生活各方面具体情况的报道性的文章，则将摘要在“苏联和人民民主国家的生活”栏内发表。
    论新事物和旧事物之间的斗争
    苏联真理报读者巴拉诺夫、卡姆涅夫和包里殊克等，要求真理报解答新事物和旧事物之间的斗争在苏联社会主义社会中的表现形式问题。一月八日真理报特发表维什尼雅科夫所著的长篇论文，答复这个问题。摘要如下：
    马列主义教导说：对立物之间的斗争，新事物和旧事物之间的斗争，垂死的和新生的之间的斗争，组成了自然和社会发展的基础。社会生活处在不断的运动和发展的状态。社会生活里永远存在着新的和旧的，生长的和垂死的东西。
    新事物和旧事物之间的斗争，是各种社会经济机构都具有的法则，它在具体的历史条件下有其特殊的表现形式。
    在分为敌对阶级的资产阶级社会中，新事物和旧事物之间的斗争，首先表现在无产阶级和资产阶级的激烈冲突方面。在这个斗争中，工人阶级是旧的剥削制度的破坏者和新的社会主义制度的创造者。
    社会主义社会具有新的发展法则。在苏联有新的社会发展动力：社会道德和政治的统一、各民族间的友好和生气勃勃的苏维埃爱国主义。这些动力都稳固地壮大着和巩固着。
    在社会主义社会里，新事物和旧事物之间的斗争，也就是由低级到高级的发展，是以批评和自我批评的方式进行的。批评和自我批评是我们发展的真正动力，是党手中的有力工具。党在布尔什维克的批评和自我批评的协助下，揭发并铲除工作中的缺点，保证成功地建设共产主义社会。
    在社会主义社会的发展过程中，在经济和文化各方面都发生着新事物的生长和旧事物的死亡现象。在我们的社会里，旧的和落后的事物被克服，新的和先进的事物的胜利，都不是自发地、任其自流地达到的，而是党和苏维埃政府的广泛组织工作和它们对新事物的大力扶持的结果。
    在争取新的、进步的斗争中，布尔什维克的批评和自我批评起着重大作用。党坚决地支持和推进来自下面的批评——从工人、集体农场农民和苏联知识分子方面来的批评，因为在这种批评里体现着数百万劳动群众的巨大建设经验。
    苏联人民的特点，是以主人翁的爱护态度对待社会主义的公有财产。党教育苏联人民以毫不调和的精神对待盗窃人民财产和浪费国家资财的人。我们的人民把苏维埃国家的利益置于一切之上。他们忘我地为社会主义祖国的富强而劳动着。
    新事物和旧事物之间的斗争，表现在社会生活的各个方面。它不仅表现在经济方面，而且也表现在思想、科学、文学和艺术等方面。
    在苏联，社会主义的生活决定着苏联人民的意识。但是，一部分苏联人民的意识中还保留着资本主义的残余。此外，资本主义的包围仍然存在，这种包围还在尽力使我们人民意识中过去的残余复活起来并给以支持。
    布尔什维克党进行着对劳动者的共产主义教育的巨大工作。它坚决地向人们意识中的资本主义残余进攻。我们人民意识中的资本主义残余如果不完全肃清，就不能建成共产主义。列宁、斯大林的党以在群众中广泛展开的思想工作和政治教育，来解决着共产主义建设的重大课题之一。在目前的条件下，劳动人民的共产主义教育具有决定性的意义。群众的共产主义觉悟程度的提高，可以促进我们成功地克服一切旧的、过时的事物，加快我们向共产主义前进的速度。
    更勇敢地注视未来
    苏联教师报一月十九日刊载了罗曼琴柯和拉兹多里斯基合著的论科学故事创作的论文，摘要如下：
    近几年来苏联的科学故事，已因一些新作品的出现而更加丰富。我们的科学故事的作者所写的优秀作品，本质上已取得了新的特点。这些书之所以有趣味，是因为它们深刻地提出了科学技术问题和努力揭示出了人类智慧的伟大。这些作品的特色是具有现代科学的基本知识，具有预见科学发展道路的本领，同时具有真正的苏维埃爱国主义的精神。青年读者们在这些书里可以发现生动的战斗着的和战胜着的人物。
    但是，总的说来，这一重要的儿童文学部门，还不能满足青年读者的增长着的要求。从事创作科学故事的作家圈子非常狭隘，大多数作品的一般思想、科学和艺术水平仍然不够。这些书的主题有限，情节和结构单调，而且还时常重复。
    我们的作家没有很好地注意苏联科学的飞跃发展，没有研究那些不断在他们面前发生的新问题。他们的“假想式”的预见和推测，有时使他们落在现代科学思想的后边。科学小说不仅应以结构的鲜明吸引读者，而且也应以它所宣传的进步发明的事实来吸引读者。
    在我们的现实条件下，所需要的是那种基于对科学思想的深刻了解而具有真正气魄、胆量和勇敢的科学故事书籍；是需要使人永远怀念的人物形象。
    毫无疑问，科学故事能够而且也应该具有使人容易接受并引人入胜的特点。从事这类著作的作者们，既不能轻视情节的鲜明和叙述的有力，也不能轻视探险故事中的最好形象所具有的那些特点。
    使科学故事的作者和苏联科学家之间保持密切而经常的联系是非常必要的。此外，扩大作家的范围，对于克服科学故事方面的落后现象，也有重大意义。因此，应当勇敢地选拔青年作家，同时吸引科学家亲自来参加科学故事的创作工作。
    科学故事的作者应该描写最近的将来、具体问题和科学课题呢，还是应该谈到最遥远的将来呢？科学故事应该同样具备这两种作品。
