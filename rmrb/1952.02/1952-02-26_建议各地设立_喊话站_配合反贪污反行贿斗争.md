    Suggest Establishing "Shouting Stations" in Various Places to Cooperate with the Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery Struggle

    To the Editor: After the news of the "Shouting Station of Shop Assistants in Huangpu District, Shanghai" was published in the newspaper, the No. 1 Inspection Work Team of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, also established a "Shouting Station."

    This "Shouting Station" is led by the local trade union and mobilizes shop assistants to participate. The method is to use a microphone to attack the "strongholds" of unscrupulous merchants and introduce the specific crimes of the unscrupulous merchants to pedestrians. At the same time, the "Shouting Station" also explains the government's policies and points out the way out for unscrupulous merchants. Shop assistants are eager to participate in the work. Although the weather is cold, the shouters shout hoarsely, but the fighting spirit is still high. Passers-by often stop at the entrance of the store and stand quietly listening. After hearing about the evil deeds of the unscrupulous merchants, the pedestrians immediately shouted impassioned slogans. For example, when shouting at Leng Chenxing's store on Jianguo Road, more than a hundred citizens participated in shouting slogans. A certain manager said: "I'm most afraid of your shouting. You help me so patiently, I will definitely confess properly." The manager of Hongyetai said: "Fortunately, with the help of the work team, I have sincerely confessed the problem, otherwise this shouting would be too embarrassing!" According to our experience, the shouting should be short, loud, vivid, and powerful, and the language should be easy to understand.

    We believe that the "Shouting Station" is a powerful weapon. It can put pressure on some illegal merchants. In government agencies, factories, mines, and schools, the method of shouting can also be used at the residences of corrupt elements, and the effect will be great. We hope that all localities can use this simple and effective weapon as much as possible.

### 建议各地设立“喊话站”  配合反贪污反行贿斗争

    建议各地设立“喊话站”
    配合反贪污反行贿斗争
    编辑同志：报上刊载了“上海市黄浦区店员的喊话站”的新闻以后，河北省唐山市第一区检查工作队也成立了“喊话站”。
    这个“喊话站”由当地工会领导，发动店员参加。方式是用话筒向奸商的“据点”进攻，并向行人介绍奸商的具体罪行。同时，也通过“喊话站”交代政府的政策，指出奸商的出路。店员们都纷纷要求参加工作。虽然天气冷，喊话人喊得声嘶力竭，但战斗情绪仍是很高。过路行人常停在商店门口静静地站着听。行人们听到奸商的罪恶行为后，立刻喊出激昂的口号。如在建国路喊冷臣兴店时，有市民百余人参加喊口号。某经理说：“就怕你们这一喊。你们那么耐心地帮助我，我一定好好交代。”鸿业太号经理说：“幸而经工作组帮助，自己已诚恳交代了问题，否则这一喊话真太难看啦！”根据我们的经验，喊话时要简短、响亮、生动、有力，语言要通俗易懂。
    我们认为：“喊话站”是一种有力武器。它能使某些不法商人受到群众压力，在机关、厂矿、学校中，对贪污分子的住处也可运用喊话的方式，效果也会很大。希望各地能够尽量采用这一简便而又有效的武器。    烽火
