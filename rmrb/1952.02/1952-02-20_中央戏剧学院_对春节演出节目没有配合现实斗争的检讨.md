    Central Academy of Drama
    Self-Criticism for Spring Festival Performances Not Aligning with Real-World Struggle

    Editor: On February 7th, the People's Daily published reader Yang Bo's opinions on the programs performed by our academy at the Labour Theatre in the Cultural Palace during the Spring Festival music and dance evening, and forwarded reader Jin Zhilin's opinions on the same issue (the content being roughly the same). We believe these opinions are entirely correct. Due to insufficient ideological emphasis on this performance work, we did not perform programs that were integrated with the current political struggle. We sincerely accept these criticisms.

    The comrades responsible for organizing these programs have now made a self-criticism. In the future, we will organize and review all our performances with greater caution and strictness. We also hope that everyone will provide more help and guidance.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中央戏剧学院
    对春节演出节目没有配合现实斗争的检讨
    编辑同志：二月七日，人民日报登载了读者杨渤同志对我院春节时在文化宫劳动剧场音乐舞蹈晚会上演出的节目的意见，和转来读者靳之林同志对这个问题的意见（内容大致相同），我们认为完全正确。由于我们在思想上对这次演出工作重视不够，所以没有演出与当前政治斗争结合的节目。我们诚恳地接受这些批评。
    现在负责组织这些节目的同志已作了检讨。今后我们将更加慎重、更加严格地组织与审查我们所有的演出节目。并希望大家给以更多的帮助与指导。
