　　Xinhua News Agency, February 15th: The notorious warmonger and U.S. State Department advisor, Dulles, delivered a provocative speech on the U.S. National Broadcasting Company program on the 10th, once again exposing the ugly face of U.S. imperialism, determined to be an enemy of the Chinese people to the very end.

　　Dulles has not learned the lesson he should have from the serious failures suffered by U.S. imperialism, and he still overestimates his capabilities, dreaming of overthrowing the People's Republic of China and restoring the U.S. imperialist rule in China that was defeated by the Chinese people. He arrogantly asserted: "The United States should clearly state our determination never to allow mainland China to continue to be controlled by the Chinese Communist Party." He expressed the idiotic dream: "We should change the nature of the regime on the mainland."

　　Dulles pathetically placed his current "magic weapon" on the small group of Kuomintang remnants cowering in Taiwan. In his speech, he openly revealed the U.S. imperialists' sinister intention to occupy our territory of Taiwan for a long time and instigate the Kuomintang remnants to harass the People's Republic of China. In his speech, Dulles advocated lifting the so-called "restrictions" imposed by the U.S. Seventh Fleet, which occupies our territory of Taiwan, on the Kuomintang remnants, so that they could engage in "free actions" to attack the mainland in order to "make the Communists pay a price in this regard." He also openly stated: "If our friends (referring to the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan) are attacked, we will use armed forces to help them."

　　However, even Dulles himself felt helpless about how to achieve his goal of re-enslaving the Chinese people and saving the U.S. defeat in Asia. Like many figures in the quarreling U.S. ruling group, he believes that the current bankrupt U.S. aggression policy in the Far East is "very inappropriate." But he had to admit that he "hasn't thought of any clear steps" to achieve his goal. Given the disastrous military adventure of U.S. aggression in Korea, Dulles, even while openly provoking the Chinese people, could not help but express a pathetic doubt about whether "MacArthur's advocated full-scale attack on Manchuria" would succeed. Thus, Dulles, like all ignorant imperialists, could only helplessly pin his hope of continuing to enslave the Chinese people on the fantasy of an "split" between China and the Soviet Union, which will never be realized.

　　From the delirium of Dulles, a warmonger driven to desperation by failure, the Chinese people not only further recognized the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism, but also once again saw the ugly state of the U.S. aggressors struggling in despair.

### 杜勒斯公开向我国人民挑衅狂妄叫嚣要长期侵占我台湾

　　杜勒斯公开向我国人民挑衅狂妄叫嚣要长期侵占我台湾
    【新华社十五日讯】著名战争贩子、美国国务院顾问杜勒斯，十日在美国全国广播公司节目中发表挑衅性的演说，再次赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义决与中国人民为敌到底的丑恶面目。
    杜勒斯没有从美帝国主义已经遭受的严重失败中得到应有的教训，仍然不自量力地梦想推翻中华人民共和国和恢复被中国人民所打垮了的美帝国主义在中国的统治。他狂妄地主张：“美国应该明白地申明我们的决心，决不让中国大陆继续由中国共产党控制。”他痴人说梦地表示：“我们应该改变大陆上的政权的性质。”
    杜勒斯眼前的“法宝”可怜地押在龟缩在台湾的一小撮国民党残匪的身上。他在演说中公开透露了美帝国主义长期霸占我国领土台湾并唆使国民党残匪对中华人民共和国进行骚扰的罪恶意图。杜勒斯在演说中主张解除侵占我国领土台湾的美国第七舰队对国民党残匪的所谓“限制”，使其从事袭击大陆的“自由行动”，以便“让共产党在这方面付出代价”。他还公开声称：“如果我们的朋友（指台湾国民党残匪）受到进攻，我们以武装部队去帮助它们。”
    但是，甚至杜勒斯自己对如何达到他的重新奴役中国人民和挽救美国在亚洲的败局的目的，也感到束手无策。他和争吵不休的美国统治集团中的许多人物一样，认为美国在远东已经破产的现行侵略政策是“非常不适当的”。但是他却不得不承认“还没有想到什么明确的步骤”来实现他的目的。鉴于美国侵略朝鲜的军事冒险遭受惨败的事实，杜勒斯甚至在向中国人民公开挑衅的同时，也不得不对“麦克阿瑟所主张的全力攻击满洲”的办法能否成功表示可悲的怀疑。于是，杜勒斯只能和一切愚昧无知的帝国主义分子一样，把他企图继续奴役中国人民的希望，无可奈何地寄托在永远无法实现的中苏两国“分裂”的幻想上。
    从杜勒斯这个因失败而走头无路的战争贩子所发出的呓语中，中国人民不但更进一步认清了美帝国主义的侵略本质，而且也再一次地看到了美国侵略者在绝望中挣扎的丑态。
