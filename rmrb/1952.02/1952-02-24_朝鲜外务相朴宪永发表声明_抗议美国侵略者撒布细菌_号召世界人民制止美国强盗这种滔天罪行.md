Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 23rd: Korean Democratic People's Republic Foreign Minister Pak Hon-yong issued a statement on the 22nd, solemnly protesting the heinous crimes of the American imperialist aggressor bandits in spreading bacteria-carrying insects in large quantities in the front and rear of Korea recently, conducting a heinous bacteriological war. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The Government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic, on May 8, 1951, lodged a serious protest with the United Nations regarding the use of bacteriological weapons by American imperialist interventionists in the war of aggression against Korea. However, at the beginning of this year, the American imperialist aggressor army once again used a large number of bacteriological weapons to massacre the people, creating the most serious criminal act in human history, and brutally violated all international laws pertaining to war.

According to reliable materials from the headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the American imperialist aggressor army has been systematically spreading various poisonous insects carrying infectious germs in large quantities from aircraft over our army's positions and our rear areas since January 28 this year.

On January 28, enemy aircraft released large quantities of three kinds of poisonous insects that had never been seen in Korea before over areas such as Longnum-dong and Longsu-dong southeast of Ichon: the first type resembled black blackflies; the second type resembled fleas; and the third type resembled ticks.

On January 29, enemy aircraft again released large quantities of flies and fleas in the Ichon area.

On February 11, enemy aircraft dropped large numbers of paper tubes and paper packages filled with fleas, spiders, mosquitoes, ants, flies, and other poisonous insects on our army positions in the Chorwon area; released large quantities of flies in the Siban-ri area; and scattered large quantities of fleas, flies, mosquitoes, grasshoppers, etc. in the Pyonggang area.

On February 13, enemy aircraft scattered large quantities of flies, mosquitoes, spiders, fleas, etc. in the Kimhwa area.

On February 15, enemy aircraft scattered large quantities of various poisonous insects such as flies and spiders in the Pyonggang area.

On February 16, enemy aircraft scattered these types of poisonous insects in the Hongsu and Ochon-ri areas east of the Bukhan River.

On February 17, four enemy aircraft scattered flies and fleas in the Sangkap-ri and Hakap-ri areas north of Pyonggang.

According to the results of bacteriological tests, it has been proven that these poisonous insects scattered by the aggressors over our army positions and our rear areas carry plague, cholera, and other infectious germs.

The enemy is thus deliberately using bacteria to massacre the Korean People's Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and the peaceful Korean people on a large scale. This has been irrefutably proven.

I am entrusted by the Government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic to lodge a serious protest in the name of the Korean people against this criminal atrocity.

After launching the war of aggression against Korea, the American imperialists brutally violated international law, carrying out a bacteriological war of mass murder of the Korean people in the front and rear, and attempting to achieve their goal of turning Korea into a US military base.

This criminal act committed by the American imperialist aggressor army is the most serious crime among the various atrocities committed by the American imperialists in Korea.

At the same time, it clearly proves that American imperialism is not only the enemy of the Korean people, but also the enemy of all peace-loving people on earth. The people of the world must know that the criminal bacteriological war waged by the American imperialists in Korea has been prepared for a long time.

The bacterial warfare department of the US Chemical Corps has created sixteen kinds of bacterial weapons that can kill people in large numbers by using air and water to spread bacteria.

In March 1951, the so-called hygiene and welfare department director of the so-called United Nations Command, Sims, led the US military's No. 1091 bacterial landing craft to Wonsan Port. Afterwards, they went to Koje Island and used prisoners of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers as experimental subjects for bacterial weapons.

In the process of committing this heinous crime, the American imperialists openly cooperated with Japanese bacterial war criminals who were formerly running dogs of Japanese militarism and whose crimes were well-established, and dispatched Japanese war criminals—Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, Masazo Kitano, etc.—to Korea. The Soviet government suggested on February 1, 1950, that these masterminds of bacterial warfare be sent to an international special military tribunal.

The American imperialists are actually cooperating with Japanese war criminals who are recognized by the whole world (including the United States) and are now conducting a large-scale bacteriological war in our country.

The American imperialist aggressor army is clearly attempting to use the irreconcilable enemy of the Korean people—Japanese militarists, especially its running dogs, the universally recognized masterminds of bacteriological warfare—Japanese war criminals, to destroy the Korean people. This conspiracy between the American imperialists and the Japanese imperialists has aroused the anger and indignation of all Korean people.

Like other atrocities committed by the American imperialists during the armistice negotiations, the bacteriological war nakedly exposes the crimes of American imperialism. Despite its use of predatory means, it will not achieve its goals in Korea. Waiting for the American imperialists is only the condemnation of peace-loving people and the complete bankruptcy of its aggressive conspiracies.

In the future, the Korean people will continue to fight together with the people of the world against the heinous atrocities of American imperialism, which tramples on international law and human morality.

We resolutely protest the new criminal acts committed by the interventionists in Korea of spreading poisonous bacteria, and call on the people of the world to stop the atrocities of the interventionists and investigate the international responsibility of the organizers of the use of bacteriological weapons.

    朝鲜外务相朴宪永发表声明
    抗议美国侵略者撒布细菌
    号召世界人民制止美国强盗这种滔天罪行
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永在二十二日发表声明，严正抗议美帝国主义侵略强盗最近在朝鲜前后方大量撒布细菌毒虫、进行罪恶的细菌战争的滔天罪行。声明全文如下：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在一九五一年五月八日曾就美帝国主义干涉者在侵略朝鲜的战争中使用细菌武器一事，向联合国提出过严重抗议。但是，美帝国主义侵略军在今年年初再度使用了大量屠杀人民的细菌武器，制造了人类史上最严重的罪恶行为，凶暴地违反了有关战争的一切国际法规。
    根据朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军司令部的确实材料，美帝国主义侵略军从今年一月二十八日起，向我军阵地及我们的后方，从飞机上有组织地大量撒布了传播传染病菌的各种毒虫。
    一月二十八日，敌军用飞机在伊川东南的龙沼洞、龙水洞等地区大量地撒放了过去在朝鲜所没有看到过的三种毒虫：第一种的形状类似黑色的黑蝇；第二种的形状像跳蚤；第三种的形状像壁虱。
    一月二十九日，敌军用飞机又在伊川地区撒布了大量的苍蝇和跳蚤。
    二月十一日，敌军用飞机对铁原地区的我军阵地投掷了装满跳蚤、蜘蛛、蚊子、蚂蚁、苍蝇及其他毒虫的大量纸筒和纸包；在市边里地区投掷了大量苍蝇，并在平康地区撒布了大量跳蚤、苍蝇、蚊子、蚱蜢等。
    二月十三日，敌机在金化地区大量撒布了苍蝇、蚊子、蜘蛛、跳蚤等。
    二月十五日，敌军用飞机在平康地区大量地撒布了苍蝇、蜘蛛等类各种毒虫。
    二月十六日，敌军飞机在北汉江以东的红树和乌川里地区又撒布了这类毒虫。
    二月十七日，敌机四架在平康以北的上甲里、下甲里地区撒布了苍蝇和跳蚤。
    根据实行细菌学试验的结果，证明侵略者向我军阵地和我们后方撒布的这些毒虫，带有鼠疫、霍乱及其他传染病菌。
    敌人是这样地为了大量地虐杀朝鲜人民军、中国人民志愿军与和平的朝鲜人民，有计划地使用着细菌。这已无可辩驳地被证实了。
    我受到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，以朝鲜人民的名义对这种罪恶的暴行提出严重的抗议。
    美帝国主义者在朝鲜发动了侵略战争后，凶暴地违反着国际公法，在前线和后方进行着大量地虐杀朝鲜人民的细菌战争，并妄图借此来实现其变朝鲜为美国的军事基地的目的。
    美帝国主义侵略军所制造的这种罪恶行为，是美帝国主义者在朝鲜所制造的各种暴行中最严重的罪行。
    同时，这清楚地证明美帝国主义不仅是朝鲜人民的仇敌，而且是地球上的一切爱好和平人民的仇敌，必须让全世界人民知道，美帝国主义者在朝鲜进行着的罪恶的细菌战争，是经过了长期的准备的。
    美国化学兵团的细菌作战部，制造了利用空气和水来撒布细菌的、可以大量杀害人民的十六种细菌武器。
    一九五一年三月，所谓联合国军总司令部的所谓卫生福利处处长赛姆斯所率领的美军第一○九一号细菌登陆艇到过元山港，其后，他们又到巨济岛，把朝鲜人民军及中国人民志愿军的俘虏当做细菌武器的试验对象。
    美帝国主义者在制造这种穷凶极恶的罪恶的过程中，公开地和过去曾是日本军国主义的走狗而且罪状确凿的日本细菌战犯合作，把日本战犯——石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏等派遣到朝鲜来。苏联政府在一九五○年二月一日曾建议把这些细菌战争的主谋者送交国际特别军事法庭。
    美帝国主义者竟和为全世界（包括美国在内）所公认的日本战犯合作，现在在我国进行着大规模的细菌战争。
    美帝国主义侵略军显然是企图利用朝鲜人民的不共戴天的仇敌——日本军国主义者，特别是它的走狗、世所公认的细菌战争的主谋者——日本战犯来毁灭朝鲜人民。美帝国主义者和日本帝国主义者的这种阴谋，引起了全朝鲜人民的愤怒和激愤。
    和美帝国主义者在停战谈判期间所制造着的其他暴行一样，细菌战争赤裸裸地暴露了美帝国主义的罪状。尽管它使用掠夺性的手段，但它在朝鲜是不能达到其目的的。等待着美帝国主义者的只是爱好和平人民的声讨和它的侵略阴谋的完全破产。
    朝鲜人民在今后将继续和全世界人民一起，为反对蹂躏着国际公法和人类道德的美帝国主义者的凶恶暴行而斗争。
    我们坚决抗议干涉者在朝鲜制造的传布有毒细菌的新的罪恶行为，并号召全世界人民制止干涉者的暴行，追究使用细菌武器的组织者的国际责任。
