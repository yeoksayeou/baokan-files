    I represent all the staff of the Air Force Headquarters in accusing the embezzler Wang Piye of his crimes of embezzlement. Wang Piye, a native of Shenyang, is 52 years old this year. He served as an engineer in the Housing Management Department of the Air Force Logistics Department in August 1950. On October 31, 1951, Liu Fengtu of the Da Zhonghua Kiln Factory, who was arrested by the Supreme People's Procuratorate, confessed his embezzlement, leading to his arrest. After his arrest, he admitted to embezzling 111.6 million yuan. After the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, after mobilization and education, he continued to confess to embezzling 141.15 million yuan. The total amount embezzled and received in bribes by the offender is 252.75 million yuan.

    Wang Piye was a technical personnel in construction. Therefore, he used his authority to collude closely with construction companies and material suppliers to steal state assets. Five construction companies had corrupt and bribery relationships with Wang Piye, including: Xingye Construction Company bribed 4,895 yuan, Yongxing Construction Company bribed 6,500 yuan, Renzhong Construction Company bribed 1,500 yuan. When selling cement to Zhengyang Construction Company, he embezzled 6.42 million yuan, Tianjin Yuxing Construction Company bribed 1.5 million yuan. He received bribes and embezzled a total of 136.87 million yuan.

    The reason why construction companies offered bribes was to massively cut corners in construction projects in order to steal state assets in large quantities. Wang Piye lost the qualities that a government worker should have. In order to enrich himself through corruption, he caused significant losses to the country's construction. For example, in the construction of the West Building at No. 22 Dongjiaomin Lane, the building subsided and cracked less than a year after completion due to the cutting of corners. In this project alone, Wang Piye received a bribe of 4,895 million yuan. He colluded with the construction company, used the name of the organization to purchase cement for merchants, totaling 2,000 bags. Not all of this cement was used in the project. Last year, when cement was in short supply, Wang Piye colluded with private merchants and sold 560 bags of the cement he had acquired. At the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, they still had 40 bags of cement stored at Zhengyang Construction Company, ready for sale.

    Another method of embezzlement used by Wang Piye was to collude with material suppliers. The material suppliers that colluded with Wang included Yikang Hardware Store, which bribed Wang 10 million yuan for selling nails, oil felt, and iron pipes to the public. Tianjin Lianfacheng Iron Factory bribed Wang 10 million yuan. Da Zhonghua Kiln Factory bribed Wang 20 million yuan. Xinxing Material Store bribed Wang 3 million yuan. Yusheng Electrical Appliance Store bribed Wang 2 million yuan. Beijing Fire Equipment Factory bribed Wang 70 million yuan when selling 800 million yuan worth of fire equipment. These six material suppliers bribed Wang a total of 115 million yuan. As a result, they passed off substandard materials as good materials to the state, causing significant losses to construction.

    In addition, Wang Piye still owed 880,000 yuan in public funds at the time of his arrest. In total, Wang Piye's embezzlement and bribery amounted to 252.75 million yuan.

    After Wang Piye was arrested, through talks and education, and with the evidence provided by the Supreme People's Procuratorate based on the confession of Liu Fengtu of the Da Zhonghua Kiln Factory, he began to admit his embezzlement, but only confessed to 111.6 million yuan. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he continued to confess to 141.15 million yuan, and reported that a private merchant had stolen more than 8 billion yuan in state assets from a national defense construction project in a certain place, and also reported the embezzlement of two other engineering personnel. He himself requested the government to hand over all his remaining embezzled funds and expressed his willingness to perform meritorious service to atone for his crimes, using his experience of corruption in the old society to expose various corrupt acts in construction. We believe that the embezzlement of the major embezzler Wang Piye has caused significant losses to the country and should be subject to severe legal sanctions. However, he confessed relatively thoroughly during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and reported the huge amount of state assets stolen by private merchants. Therefore, his sentence can be reduced. We request the Supreme People's Court Temporary Tribunal to impose an appropriate punishment.

### 空军司令部代表白云  对大贪污犯王丕业的控诉

    空军司令部代表白云  
    对大贪污犯王丕业的控诉
    我代表空军司令部全体工作人员向大会控诉贪污犯王丕业的贪污罪行。王丕业，沈阳人，今年五十二岁，于一九五○年八月担任空军后勤部营房管理处工程师，一九五一年十月三十一日，被最高检察署逮捕的大中华窑厂的刘凤图，供出了他的贪污材料，因而予以逮捕。被捕后，他曾承认贪污一亿一千一百六十万元，到反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始之后，经过动员教育又继续坦白贪污一亿四千一百一十五万元。该犯共计贪污受贿二亿五千二百七十五万元。
    王丕业是修建方面的技术人员，因之他便利用自己的职权，与营造业、材料行密切勾结，盗窃国家资材。曾与王丕业有贪污行贿关系的营造厂就有五家，计：兴业营造厂行贿四千八百九十五万元，永兴营造厂行贿六千五百万元，人众营造厂行贿一千五百万元，在向正阳营造厂卖洋灰时，贪污了六百四十二万元，天津裕兴营造厂行贿一百五十万元。他先后共受贿贪污一亿三千六百八十七万元。
    营造厂之所以行贿，就是为了在修建工程中大量的偷工减料，以达到大量盗窃国家资财的目的。而王丕业则丧失了一个政府工作人员应有的品质，为了贪污自肥，使国家的建设受到重大的损失。如修建东交民巷二十二号西楼工程，由于偷工减料的结果，该房子修起不到一年便下沉裂缝了。在这一个工程中，王丕业即受贿四千八百九十五万元，他与营造厂勾结，利用机关名义，替商人套买洋灰，共二千袋，这些套买的洋灰并未全部用到工程上去。在去年洋灰供不应求的情况下，王丕业与私商勾结，曾将套买的洋灰出卖五百六十袋，到反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，他们还在正阳营造厂存放着四十袋洋灰，准备出卖。
    王丕业另外一种贪污的方法，即是与材料行勾结。与王勾结的材料行，有义康五金行，它卖给公家钉子、油毡、铁管子等，对王行贿一千万元。天津联发成铁工厂，对王行贿一千万元。大中华窑厂，对王行贿二千万元。新兴材料行，对王行贿三百万元。裕生电料行对王行贿二百万元。北京消火器材厂卖八亿元的消火器材时，对王行贿七千万元。这六家材料行即共对王行贿一亿一千五百万元。他们因此以劣等器材冒充好器材卖给国家，使修建受到了重大的损失。
    此外，在王丕业被逮捕时还欠公款八十八万元。总合起来王丕业的贪污受贿达二亿五千二百七十五万元。
    王丕业在被逮捕之后，经过谈话教育，并由于最高检察署从大中华窑厂刘凤图的口供得出的材料作证，才开始承认了自己的贪污事实，但还只坦白了
    一亿一千一百六十万元。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动之中，又继续坦白了一亿四千一百一十五万元，并向政府揭发某地国防建设工程曾被私商盗窃国家资财八十亿元以上，并检举了其他两个工程人员的贪污事实。他本人并向政府请求愿将所存的贪污款项全部交出，并愿为人民戴罪立功，以自己在旧社会贪污行为的经验来揭发各种修建中的贪污行为。我们认为大贪污分子王丕业的贪污行为，使国家造成了重大的损失，是应予以严厉的法律制裁，但在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动之中，坦白比较彻底，并曾揭发了私商盗窃国家资财的巨大数字，还是可以减罪，请最高人民法院临时法庭予以适当的制裁。
