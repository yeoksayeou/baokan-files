To the Editor:

On October 4th of last year, a flood occurred in the state-owned Donggou Coal Mine in Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province, drowning twenty-two workers. The cause of this accident was the bourgeois mentality of the coal mine's leadership cadres, who focused solely on profit and neglected worker safety. As early as 1947, a similar accident occurred in the coal mine when water accumulated in an abandoned mine, drowning three workers. However, the coal mine leadership ignored this lesson and did not adopt the workers' rational suggestions (such as the workers suggesting setting up a waterproof trench underground and using seven- or eight-foot-long steel drills to probe for water to prevent floods). More than ten days before this accident, small holes were already leaking water underground, and the water volume in the roadways had increased dramatically. After the workers reported the situation, the manager and others ignored it, instead accusing the workers of "deliberately sabotaging production" and scolding them, saying, "Tadpoles can't live without water." Some workers, seeing that the situation was bad, feigned illness and asked for leave to go home. Even this did not attract the leadership's attention. After the accident occurred, the leadership, fearing responsibility, told the workers that the accident was sudden and had no prior signs, and forbade workers from speaking carelessly. The relevant departments of Shanxi Province have attached great importance to this accident and have notified all parts of the province to launch discussions in light of specific circumstances. The Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government has sent an inspection team to inspect the situation and handle the aftermath.

    洞沟煤矿淹死工人二十二名
    对失职人员应严格处理
    编辑同志：去年十月四日，山西襄垣县公营洞沟煤矿发生水灾，淹死二十二个工人。发生这次事故的原因是煤矿的领导干部有单纯营利的资产阶级观点，忽视工人安全。早在一九四七年，煤矿就发生过老空窑蓄水暴涨，淹死三个工人的事故。但煤矿领导方面忽视这个教训，也不采纳工人的合理化建议（比如工人曾建议窑下设立防水壕，设置七、八尺长的钢钻探水，以防止水灾）。这次事故前十多天，井下已有小孔冒水和巷道水量激增的现象。工人们反映情况后，经理等都置之不理，反说工人“有意破坏生产”，骂工人说：“蛤蟆蝌蚪离了水不能活。”有些工人见势头不好，就装病请假回家。这样，仍没有引起领导方面的重视。事故发生后，领导方面怕负责任，就对工人们说，这次事故是突然的，事先没有象征，并禁止工人随便乱说。山西省有关部门对这一事故非常重视，已通报全省各地结合具体情况展开讨论。中央人民政府燃料工业部煤矿管理总局已派检查组前往检查，并处理善后。
