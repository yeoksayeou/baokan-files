    The Trade Department of the Central-South Military and Administrative Committee has taken measures to strengthen the main business operations of the state-owned trade departments throughout the region without affecting the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the agencies.

    After the anti-corruption struggle in the state-owned trade system of the Central-South region entered the stage of encircling and suppressing major embezzlers in February, daily business operations were once relaxed. In order to change this situation, the Central-South Trade Department and its affiliated specialized companies have selected approximately one-fifth of their cadres to form business offices, which began operating on the 20th to strengthen the leadership of business operations. Thus, each unit has two offices: one responsible for leading the movement; and one responsible for leading business operations. These personnel who have been selected to be responsible for business operations have been vetted by the leadership and the masses of each agency. For certain original responsible personnel who were suspended or dismissed due to corruption, resulting in vacant positions, the leadership of each agency has promoted active elements with business abilities who have emerged in the movement to temporarily act in their positions. Based on national needs, as well as the needs of farmers in the Central-South region during the spring plowing season and the needs of urban industrial production, the main business operations that the Central-South Trade Department has resumed and strengthened are in four aspects: (1) The Central-South Region Company of the China Grain Company has decided to strengthen the allocation of grain within and outside the region on the basis of its original work. (2) The Central-South Region Company of the China Native Produce Company, the Central-South Region Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the Central-South Region Company of the China Animal Products Company, and the Central-South Region Company of the China Tea Company, etc., have decided to resume and strengthen the purchase, or preparation for the purchase, of major agricultural products such as cotton, tobacco leaves, sugarcane, fur, eggs, and spring tea; in order to guarantee the supply of raw materials for industrial production, the Central-South Region Company of the China Industrial Equipment Company has decided to continue purchasing a portion of industrial equipment. (3) The Central-South Region Company of the China General Merchandise Company, the Central-South Region Company of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the Central-South Region Company of the China Grain Company, etc., have decided to continue the entrusted processing of knitwear, general merchandise, yarn, cloth, rice, and flour. (4) Each company will immediately handle and sun-dry items that are about to deteriorate to prevent damage. Currently, each specialized company is revising or formulating its business plan for March; the Central-South Trade Department has also sent a telegram instructing the industrial and commercial trade departments of each province and city in the Central-South region to immediately carry out this work.

    中南国营贸易部门加强主要业务工作
    在不影响反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动的情况下抽出一部分经过审查的干部组成业务办公室
    中南军政委员会贸易部已采取措施，在不影响机关进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的情况下，加强全区国营贸易部门的主要业务工作。
    二月份中南区国营贸易系统的反贪污斗争进入围剿大贪污犯阶段以后，曾一度放松了日常业务工作。为了改变这一情况，中南贸易部及所属各专业公司已抽出了约五分之一的干部组成了业务办公室，自二十日起开始办公，加强对业务工作的领导。这样，各单位都有了两个办公室：一个负责领导运动；一个负责领导业务工作。这些被抽调负责业务工作的人员，都是经过各机关领导方面和群众的审查的。某些原来的负责人员因贪污被停职、撤职以致工作岗位空缺的，已由各机关领导方面提拔那些有业务能力、在运动中涌现出来的积极分子，暂时代理职务。根据全国需要以及中南区春耕生产季节农民的需要和城市工业生产的需要，中南贸易部恢复和加强的主要业务工作有四方面：（1）中国粮食公司中南区公司已决定在原有工作基础上加强对区内外的粮食调拨工作。（2）中国土产公司中南区公司、中国花纱布公司中南区公司、中国畜产公司中南区公司、中国茶业公司中南区公司等已决定恢复、加强收购或准备收购棉花、烟叶、蔗糖、皮毛、蛋品、春茶等主要农产品；为了保证工业生产的原料供应，中国工业器材公司中南区公司决定继续收购一部分工业器材。（3）中国百货公司中南区公司、中国花纱布公司中南区公司、中国粮食公司中南区公司等决定继续进行针织品、百货、纱布、米面的委托加工工作。（4）各公司立即处理、翻晒即将变质的物品，以免损坏。现在，各专业公司正在修订或编制三月份的业务计划；中南贸易部并已发出电文，指示中南区各省、市的工商贸易部门立即进行这一工作。    （新华社）
