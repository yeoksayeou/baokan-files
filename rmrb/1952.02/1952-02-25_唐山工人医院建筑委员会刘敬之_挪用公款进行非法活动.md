    Liu Jingzhi of the Construction Committee of Tangshan Workers' Hospital
    Embezzles Public Funds for Illegal Activities

    Comrade Editor: Liu Jingzhi, the Chief of the Finance Section of the Construction Committee of Tangshan Workers' Hospital (and concurrently the Minister of the Finance Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions), has embezzled a huge amount of public funds for illegal activities. Under the pretext of engaging in production for the organization, Liu Jingzhi spent over 850 million yuan in funds from May to October 1951. He used over 170 million yuan to buy building materials for the hospital, and used the other 600 million yuan for the following activities: (1) He gave a portion of the funds to Li Ming (a businessman), the manager of the Workers' Clothing Factory, to open a shop in Zunhua; (2) He partnered with private merchants to buy a large batch of pig iron, handing over the proceeds from the sales to the private merchants; another batch of iron could not be sold, leaving these funds tied up with the public; (3) He used the funds to transport and sell large quantities of cloth, evading taxes of 20 million yuan.

    Liu Jingzhi once lent 50 million yuan of public funds at high interest to the Qiming Factory (a joint public-private enterprise). After a few months, Liu Jingzhi brought back 4.2 million yuan in interest, which the leadership did not accept, and the whereabouts of this money later became unknown. Liu borrowed 40 bolts of cloth from the Workers' Hospital on behalf of the Workers' Clothing Factory, but there is no record of this transaction in the accounts of the Workers' Clothing Factory.

    During the anti-corruption movement, Liu returned 300 million yuan of the more than 600 million yuan in funds he had used, with the remaining 300 million yuan still not returned. Liu made five self-criticisms in group meetings, but each time refused to make a thorough confession. I request that the relevant departments promptly address this issue.

    唐山工人医院建筑委员会刘敬之
    挪用公款进行非法活动
    编辑同志：唐山市工人医院建筑委员会财务处长刘敬之（兼市总工会财务部部长）挪用巨额公款，进行非法活动。刘敬之藉口搞机关生产，从一九五一年五月到十月，支用基金八亿五千多万元。他用一亿七千多万元为医院买了建筑材料，用其他六亿多元，进行以下活动：（一）把一部分基金交给工人被服厂经理李铭（商人），让他在遵化开了一个铺子；（二）和私商合伙买了一大批生铁，把卖掉的款子交给私商；还有一批铁卖不出去，这些资金就压在公家身上；（三）用基金贩运大布，漏税二千万元。
    刘敬之曾经把公款五千万元，高利贷给启明工厂
    （公私合营）。过了几个月，刘敬之拿来利息四百二十万元，领导方面没有收，这笔钱以后就不知下落了。刘替工人被服厂向工人医院借布四十匹，但工人被服厂的账上没有这笔账。
    在反贪污运动中，刘把动用的六亿多元基金，归还了三亿元，另外三亿元仍未交回。刘在小组会上检讨过五次，每次都不肯彻底交代。我要求有关部门抓紧处理这个问题。  刘福禄
