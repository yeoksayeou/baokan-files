	Young Pioneer Yao Dajun
	Exposes His Embezzling Father
	Song Ailing

	Yao Dajun is a 15-year-old student in the first year of junior high school at Beijing Xinying Middle School, and a Young Pioneer. In this anti-corruption movement, he bravely exposed his father, Yao Yumin's, embezzlement crimes, demonstrating the fine qualities of the new China's children in loving the motherland and protecting public property.

	Yao Yumin was a clerk in the general affairs office of Xinying Middle School, responsible for the warehouse. He used his position to steal, organizing nine staff members of the school to carry out collective embezzlement, and colluding with Wang Shijie, an accountant at Rong Sheng Wood Factory, to steal a large amount of people's property. According to preliminary investigations, this included 630 bags of flour, 540 pounds of white sugar, and a large amount of cloth, coal, kerosene, etc. He also embezzled more than 120 million yuan in school subsidies for one and a half months. After the anti-corruption movement began, the person in charge of Xinying Middle School mobilized Yao Yumin to confess several times. However, Yao Yumin was extremely cunning, refusing to confess the truth, always using lies such as "the warehouse ledger is lost" and "I can't remember" to cover up, trying to escape.

	The excellent Young Pioneer, Yao Dajun, learned about his father's embezzlement after the movement started. Hoping that his father would confess and repent, he went to mobilize his father, saying, "Dad, how much stuff did you take from the school? Hurry up and confess!" But Yao Yumin kept denying it, deceiving Yao Dajun by saying, "I've said everything I can think of." Seeing that mobilizing him was useless, Yao Dajun was determined to resolutely fight this embezzler who stole national property. He began to pay attention to his father's actions. One day, the profiteer Wang Shijie suddenly came to his house in a panic and said to Yao Yumin, "It's been a big stir these days! Yesterday, two students from Xinying Middle School came to ask me if I knew you. I said I knew you a little because I used to work at the school. They also asked how much flour you had stored with me. I said there was such a thing, maybe three or four bags! If they ask again, let's both say that." After coordinating their stories, the profiteer left. Yao Dajun heard everything they said. His father threatened him not to tell anyone, but the clever Yao Dajun immediately saw through his father's trick and immediately ran to the school to tell the principal about the situation.

	On the morning of January 23rd, students from Xinying Middle School went to his house to ask for the ledger. Yao Dajun's mother claimed she "didn't know." After the students left, his mother took out the secretly hidden ledger and asked Yao Dajun to hide it in the toilet. Yao Dajun took it and saw that it was the warehouse ledger. He was extremely happy. He thought, "Now Dad can't deny it anymore, this ledger is the evidence. I am a glorious Young Pioneer, I must hand this ledger over to the principal." But he also thought, "If I do this, what if Mom and Dad hit me, scold me, or don't want me anymore?" While he was intensely struggling, he saw the bright red scarf tied around his neck. This gave him the greatest courage, and he made up his mind: "If I don't do this, I will be letting down the motherland and the lovely red scarf. What am I afraid of! As long as I do the right thing, the people will support me!" So that afternoon, at the school's struggle meeting, Yao Dajun exposed his father on the spot and handed over the ledger. He also found other bills from his home. This collective embezzlement case was thus solved.

	On February 8th, the Beijing Municipal Middle and Primary School Thrift Inspection Committee held an anti-corruption conference and, based on Yao Dajun's report, arrested the embezzler Yao Yumin, who refused to confess, on the spot.

    少年儿童队员姚大钧
    检举了贪污的父亲
    宋皑凌
    姚大钧是北京新英中学初中一年级的学生，今年十五岁，是一个少年儿童队员。在这次反贪污运动中，他勇敢地检举了他的父亲姚育民的贪污罪行，表现了新中国少年儿童热爱祖国、爱护公共财物的优良品质。
    姚育民是新英中学总务处的庶务员，负责保管仓库。他利用职权，监守自盗。曾组织本校九个职员进行集体贪污，并串通荣盛木厂账房王世杰，大量盗窃人民财产。据初步调查，计有面粉六百三十袋、白糖五百四十斤以及大量布匹、煤、煤油等。并贪污了一个半月的学校补助金，共一亿二千多万元。反贪污运动展开后，新英中学的负责人几次动员姚育民坦白；但姚育民异常狡猾，坚不吐实，总是用“仓库的账丢了”、“我记不清了”等假话打掩护，企图逃过“关”去。
    优秀的少年儿童队员姚大钧在运动开始后，知道了父亲有贪污行为。他希望父亲能坦白悔过，便去动员他父亲说：“爸爸，你拿了学校多少东西？赶快去坦白吧！”但姚育民一味抵赖，欺骗姚大钧说：“凡是我想到的都说了。”姚大钧见动员他没有用，就下决心要坚决和这个偷盗国家资财的贪污分子进行斗争。他开始注意父亲的行动。有一天，奸商王世杰忽然慌慌张张地到他家里来，对姚育民说：“这几天闹得可够厉害！昨天有新英中学的两个学生来问我认识不认识你，我说因为过去在学校做过活儿，有点认识。他还问你在我那儿存了多少面，我说有这么回事，大概有三、四袋吧！他们要是再问，咱们俩就这么说吧。”串好口供后奸商就走了。他们说的话，姚大钧都听到了。他父亲威吓他不许向别人说，但聪明的姚大钧一下就看出了他父亲的鬼把戏，马上跑到学校，把这个情况告诉了校长。
    一月二十三日上午，新英中学的学生到他家里去要账本。姚大钧的母亲推说“不知道”。等学生走后，他母亲就把偷藏着的账本拿出来，让姚大钧给藏到厕所里去。姚大钧接过来一看，就是那本库账，真高兴极了。他想：“这下子爸爸再也不能抵赖了，这个账本就是证据。我是一个光荣的少年儿童队员，我一定要把这本账交给校长。”但他又想到：“我这样做，如果爸爸、妈妈打我、骂我或者不要我了怎么办呢？”正在激烈地进行思想斗争的时候，他看到了系在颈项上的鲜红的红领巾。这给了他最大的勇敢，他下了决心：“我不这样做，就对不起祖国和可爱的红领巾。我怕什么！只要我做得对，人民就会支持我！”于是当天下午在学校的斗争大会上，姚大钧当场检举了他父亲，把账本交了出来。他并且又从家里找出其他的账单。这个集体贪污案就这样被破获了。
    北京市中、小学节约检查委员会在二月八日举行反贪污大会，根据姚大钧的检举材料，当场逮捕了拒不坦白的贪污分子姚育民。
