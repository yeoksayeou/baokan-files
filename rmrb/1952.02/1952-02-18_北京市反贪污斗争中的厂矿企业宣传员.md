	Propaganda Workers in Factories and Mines in Beijing's Anti-Corruption Struggle
	Bao Lun, Peng Jing

	In the struggle to hunt down major embezzlers, Party propaganda workers in factories and mines in Beijing actively mobilized and organized the masses through various forms of propaganda, powerfully promoting the movement.

	During the movement, some corrupt elements pretended to be active and refused to confess. The propaganda workers launched a propaganda offensive aimed at these people. Guan Zhizheng of the Line Section of the Beijing Railway Station Engineering Department was the target of the section's encirclement. However, at first, he not only refused to confess, but also pretended to actively "promote" the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, attempting to deceive the masses and get through the "checkpoint." In order to thoroughly expose and isolate him, the propaganda workers systematically fought against him, drawing cartoons of his flustered, uneasy, and evasive actions in a timely manner, and using clapper talk to widely publicize them among the masses. For example, a clapper talk was created targeting his pretense of being active: "There are problems, he won't talk, carrying his burden 'doing propaganda,' the report still isn't finished after a month, suspiciously sitting uncomfortably." A clapper talk was created targeting him talking about small things but not big things: "The surrounding slogans are like artillery shells, hitting him so he can't sit or sleep in peace, the masses are pressing him so he has no choice, that's why he talks about some small incidents." Once, Guan Zhizheng went to the cafeteria to eat. Seeing that anti-corruption was being promoted there, he felt a lot of pressure. He grabbed a bun and turned to leave, but in a panic, he kicked over the iron bucket. The propaganda workers seized on this and wrote a clapper talk about it, reciting it everywhere. At the same time, the propaganda workers arranged an anti-corruption propaganda campaign around him: at noon, they beat gongs and drums, showed shadow plays, and exposed his embezzlement facts, and organized a mobile propaganda team in the office to carry out propaganda in their spare time. Under these circumstances, Guan Zhizheng was forced to confess some problems twice, but his attitude was very insincere. So the propaganda workers drew a cartoon of him: two hands squeezing a tube of toothpaste, with "group meeting" written on one hand and "step by step tightening" written on the other hand, and "face" written in response to Guan Zhizheng's ideological concerns. In this way, Guan Zhizheng's mask was completely torn off. He was completely isolated in the mass encirclement and was forced to admit to stealing some wires, etc.

	The propaganda workers promptly corrected the paralyzed thinking of some units. When the staff of the Telephone Room of the Second Telephone Bureau of the Telecommunications Bureau began to launch a surprise search for major embezzlers, they were very paralyzed. Some people even made strange remarks: "We don't have corruption or waste here, the biggest corruption is a handful of mud, walking back and forth wastes two legs." Some people were unwilling to even attend group meetings, thinking it was "meaningless." In order to break through this "backward point," propaganda worker Tang Shuqin collected some major corruption facts and made a special propaganda visit to the telephone room. She cited the fact that warehouse manager Guan Xizhen stole equipment and linked it to the situation in the telephone room, saying, "We are working diligently, and we are still afraid of affecting the citizens' use of the telephone; however, corrupt elements can mess around and make all our efforts come to naught. Like Guan Xizhen replacing the phonetic symbols in the telephone with old ones, users have to question the operators: 'Why are we paying money for bad telephones?'" Then she said, "Everyone is responsible for anti-corruption. The comrades in the telephone room should participate in the struggle like the staff in other units so that they can strengthen the strength of our anti-corruption camp." Because Tang Shuqin's propaganda was based on facts and linked to the thinking of the staff, the effect was very good. Some staff members changed their attitude at the time, saying, "With these facts of corruption, why didn't we fight against it earlier?" When discussing Guan Xizhen's problem, the staff in the telephone room enthusiastically participated in the large group meeting and made many suggestions to Guan Xizhen. Currently, Guan Xizhen has confessed his problems under the pressure of the masses: stealing important equipment from the warehouse worth more than 16 million yuan.

	The propaganda workers implemented and publicized the Party's policies. Ye Duo, a major embezzler in the Mechanical and Electrical Section of the Postal Bureau, leaked the bid price, causing the state to lose 80 million yuan; but he stubbornly refused to confess and resisted the anti-corruption movement. Propaganda worker Bai Jiasheng discovered this problem and discussed a method with Youth League members Zhang Hao and Li Guixin - "giving gifts." That is, compiling Ye Duo's various corruption facts into clapper talk and singing it to him in public as a gift. This "gift" included exposing his resistance to the movement to the masses, such as "Ye Duo, so stubborn, he pretends to be confused at the meeting, stubbornly refuses to confess, 'never borrowed money from ××, only borrowed a million.'" It also included explaining policies to him and mobilizing him to confess, such as "Ye Duo, wake up, stop playing tricks with us. Confess quickly, don't be afraid, confessing problems can be lenient. ... Covering up, refusing to talk, the future will definitely be ruined." After the propaganda workers finished singing, another propaganda worker from Ye Duo's group made a statement on behalf of the group: "Our group very much welcomes these comrades' valuable gift to Ye Duo, and we must help him confess thoroughly." At that time, there were more than 200 staff members present. This method of "taking off his pants" in public urged Ye Duo to strengthen his ideological struggle, forcing him to confess to embezzling more than 8 million yuan that night, and more than 15 million yuan the next day, a total of more than 23 million yuan.

    北京市反贪污斗争中的厂矿企业宣传员
    宝伦  彭静
    在追捕大贪污分子的斗争中，北京各厂矿企业的党的宣传员利用各种宣传方式，积极动员和组织群众，有力地推动了运动。
    运动中，有些贪污分子假装积极，不肯坦白，宣传员就针对这些人展开了宣传攻势。北京车站工务段线路股的关治政是该股的围攻对象，但是最初他不但不坦白，而且假装积极地“宣传”反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义。企图蒙骗群众，混过“关”去。为了彻底揭露他、孤立他，宣传员有计划地对他进行了斗争，把他慌张不安、躲躲闪闪的一举一动都及时地画出漫画，配以快板，在群众中广泛宣传。如针对他伪装积极编出快板：“有问题，不肯谈，背着包袱‘做宣传’，表报一月还做不完，疑神疑鬼坐不安。”针对他谈小不谈大编出快板：“周围的标语似炮弹，打得他坐卧不稳心不安，群众压得没法办，这才谈出点小事件。”有一次关治政到食堂吃饭，看见那里正在宣传反贪污，他感到压力很大，拿了馒头转身就走，却慌慌张张把铁桶踢倒了。宣传员又抓住这事给他编了快板，到处说唱。与此同时，宣传员又在他的周围布置了一个反贪污的宣传工作：在中午，敲着锣鼓，拉着洋片，揭发他的贪污事实，并且在办公室里组织流动宣传队，抽空子进行宣传。在这种情况下，关治政两次被迫交代了一些问题，但态度很不老实。于是宣传员又给他画了一张漫画：两只手挤一筒牙膏，一只手上写着“小组会”，一只手上写着“步步紧”，针对关治政的思想顾虑，又写上“面子”牌。这样关治政的假面具就完全被撕破，在群众围攻中完全孤立，又被迫承认偷了一些电线等等。
    对于某些单位的麻痹思想，宣传员及时进行了纠正。电信局电话二局话务室职工在开始突击搜查大贪污分子的时候，表现很麻痹。有的人甚至还说怪话：“我们这儿不会有贪污、浪费，顶大贪污一把泥，来回走路浪费两条腿。”有的人连小组会都不愿参加，认为“没意思”。为了突破这个“落后点”，宣传员唐淑琴搜集了一些较大的贪污事实，特地到话务室做了一次宣传。她列举了仓库管理员关锡珍偷盗器材的事实并联系话务室的情况说：“我们兢兢业业地工作着，还直怕影响市民用电话；可是，贪污分子捣捣鬼，就可以使咱们全功尽弃。像关锡珍把话机里的注音器来一个以旧换新，人家用户就得责问话务员：‘干吗我们花钱没好电话用？’”接着她说：“反贪污人人有责，话务室同志们应当和其他单位职工一样地参加斗争，这样就能加强我们反贪污阵营的力量。”由于唐淑琴的宣传是利用事实、联系职工思想进行的，所以效果很好。有些职工当时就改变了态度，说：“有这些贪污事实，为什么不早反呢？”在讨论关锡珍的问题时，话务室职工都踊跃地参加了大组会，并且对关锡珍提了很多意见。目前，关锡珍已在群众压力下坦白了自己的问题：偷窃仓库的重要器材共值一千六百多万元。
    宣传员贯彻宣传了党的政策。邮政局机工股有个大贪污分子叶多绩，泄露标底，使国家损失八千万元；但他死不坦白，抵抗反贪污运动。宣传员白家盛发现了这个问题，就和青年团员张浩、李桂馨商量了一条办法——“送礼”。就是把叶多绩的各种贪污事实，编成快板，当做礼物，当众唱给他听。这个“礼物”中，有向群众揭穿他抵抗运动的，如“叶多绩，真顽固，他在会上装糊涂，咬定牙关不坦白，‘没向××借过钱，仅仅借了一百万’”。有向他讲解政策，动员他坦白的，如“叶多绩，快清醒，别再跟我们耍花灯。快交代，别害怕，交代了问题可宽大。……打掩护，死不谈，前途一定要玩完”。宣传员唱完以后，叶多绩小组的另一个宣传员代表小组声明：“我们小组非常欢迎这几位同志送给叶多绩的宝贵礼物，我们一定要帮助他彻底坦白。”当时，有二百多个职工在场，这种当众替他“脱裤子”的办法，督促叶多绩加强了思想斗争，迫使他当晚坦白了贪污八百多万元，第二天又坦白了一千五百多万，共二千三百多万元。
