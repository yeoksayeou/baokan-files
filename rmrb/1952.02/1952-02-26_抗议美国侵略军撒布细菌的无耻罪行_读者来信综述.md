    Protesting the Outrageous Crime of the American Aggressors Spreading Bacteria
    —Summary of Readers' Letters
    Many medical experts, professors, medical workers, and students continue to write to this newspaper, protesting the crime of American imperialism spreading bacteria in Korea to kill Chinese and Korean soldiers and the Korean people.
    Jin Baoshan, Director of the Technical Office of the Central Ministry of Health, said in his letter: After suffering an irretrievable defeat on the Korean battlefield, American imperialism resorted to its long-prepared germ warfare as a desperate gamble. American imperialism even colluded with Japanese bacterial war criminals, who are deeply hated by the people of the world, using them to employ bacterial weapons and brutally kill peaceful people. The crimes of American imperialism have been condemned by the people of the world.
    Zhu Jiming, Director of the Biological Products Research Institute of the Central Ministry of Health, wrote in his letter: American imperialism is following the path of the Japanese aggressors, a fact that has been newly proven by the inhuman germ warfare conducted by the American invading forces in Korea.
    Yan Jingqing, President of the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, wrote in his letter: Historical facts prove that imperialist countries that have engaged in germ warfare in the past have not achieved victory as a result, but have instead suffered the fate of destruction. However, we must not be negligent about this. Our medical and health circles should actively prepare and respond to the call of the people of the motherland at any time, to protect the safety of the people's lives, to protect the safety of the motherland, and to protect world peace and security!
    Fang Liang, Li Xigan, and Tao Shanmin, professors of the Department of Bacteriology at Peking University Medical College, said in their letter: Japanese imperialism used bacterial weapons at the end of World War II, but ultimately failed. The American aggressors will not escape this fate of death. We know that atomic bombs cannot scare peaceful people, and bacterial weapons cannot scare peaceful people either. Because the outcome of war is determined by the nature of the war. Our struggle against the American aggressors is just, and victory will belong to us!
    Xie Shaowen, Professor of the Department of Bacteriology at the Chinese Union Medical College, said: We bacterial workers should strongly protest the crime of American aggressors spreading bacteria, so that peace-loving and righteous people all over the world can understand the ugly face of the enemy and punish it collectively.
    The staff of the Inspection Department of the Biological Products Research Institute of the Central Ministry of Health wrote in their letter: The American aggressors' heinous crime of spreading bacteria to exterminate humanity is intolerable. We will rush to make vaccines to defend against and eliminate the bacteria spread by American imperialism!
    All the students of Peking University wrote in a letter: We must not tolerate this bloody crime of American imperialism. We call on peace-loving people all over the world to take immediate action to stop the shameless behavior of the American aggressors.
    In the letters above, medical and health workers have expressed their intention to take active action to carry out effective defense work and combat the violent behavior of the American aggressors.

    抗议美国侵略军撒布细菌的无耻罪行
    ——读者来信综述
    许多医学专家、教授、医务工作者及广大学生继续投书本报，抗议美帝国主义在朝鲜撒布细菌杀害中朝战士和朝鲜人民的罪行。
    中央卫生部技术室主任金宝善的来信中说：美帝国主义在朝鲜战场上遭到了无法挽救的惨败后，又把他准备已久的细菌战搬出来，以孤注一掷。美帝国主义甚至和世界人民深痛恶绝的日本细菌战犯勾结起来，利用他们使用细菌武器，惨杀和平人民。美帝国主义的罪行，已经受到全世界人民的谴责。
    中央卫生部生物制品研究所主任朱既明来信说：美帝国主义正在走日本侵略者的道路，这一事实从侵朝美军所进行的惨无人道的细菌战，又得到了新的证明。
    中国红十字会北京市分会会长严镜清来信说：历史事实证明，过去曾进行过细菌战的帝国主义国家，并没有因此取得胜利，反而遭受了覆亡的命运。但我们对此切不能麻痹大意，我们医药卫生界，应该积极准备，随时响应祖国人民的号召，为保卫人民生命安全、为保卫祖国安全、为保卫世界和平安全而努力！
    北京大学医学院细菌学科教授方亮、黎希干、陶善敏的信中说：日本帝国主义在第二次世界大战末期，曾使用过细菌武器，但最后还是失败了，美国侵略者也将逃不出这个死亡命运。我们知道原子弹不能吓倒和平人民，细菌武器同样也不能吓倒和平人民。因为战争的胜负决定于战争的本质。我们反对美国侵略者的斗争是正义的，胜利必属于我们！
    中国协和医学院细菌学系教授谢少文说：我们细菌工作者应该对美国侵略军撒布细菌的罪行提出严重抗议，让全世界拥护和平和正义的人民了解敌人的丑恶嘴脸，群起制裁它。
    中央卫生部生物制品研究所检定所全体人员的来信中说：美国侵略军灭绝人性的撒布细菌的滔天罪行，是不可容忍的。我们将赶制疫苗来防御和扑灭美帝国主义所撒布的细菌！
    北京大学全体学生来信说：我们绝不能容忍美帝国主义这一血腥罪行。我们呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民立刻行动起来，制止美国侵略者的无耻行为。
    以上医药卫生工作者的来信中，都表示要积极行动起来，作有效的防御工作，打击美国侵略军的狂暴行为。
