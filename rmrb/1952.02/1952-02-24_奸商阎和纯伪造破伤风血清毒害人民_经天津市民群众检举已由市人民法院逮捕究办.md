    The Traitorous Merchant Yan Hechun Fabricated Tetanus Antitoxin, Poisoning the People
    After being reported by the citizens of Tianjin, the Tianjin Municipal People's Court has arrested him for investigation and prosecution.
    The traitorous merchant Yan Hechun, devoid of humanity, fabricated and sold large quantities of tetanus antitoxin, poisoning the people. After being reported by the citizens of Tianjin to the Economy and Austerity Inspection Committee of the Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau, and verified by the committee's investigation, the Municipal People's Court has arrested Yan and Bao Wenchou, an employee of the Drug Administration Section of the Public Health Bureau who shielded Yan's sale of fake tetanus antitoxin. They will be severely punished according to law.
    The criminal Yan once served as a military doctor in the Kuomintang bandit army. After liberation, he did not engage in honest work, but made a living by reselling Western medicine. In 1949, driven by greed, the criminal Yan became so depraved that he and his daughter, Yan Shuzhen, continuously fabricated large quantities of impure and toxic tetanus antitoxin in a small room on the upper floor of Huachang Store in Tianjin. They falsely claimed that it was produced by the "Xinhua Serum and Vaccine Factory" (which does not exist at all) and sold it in large quantities to other places. According to current incomplete statistics, the criminal has sold a total of 13,589 "tetanus antitoxin" injections, defrauding people of more than 126 million RMB. The harm to people's lives is currently incalculable.
    The criminal Yan used bribery to become acquainted with Bao Wenchou, an employee of the Drug Administration Section of the Public Health Bureau. The criminal Bao accepted Yan's bribes and disregarded the interests of the people, shielding Yan's manufacture of fake medicine. In December 1950, the Central Institute of Biological Products had already researched that the tetanus antitoxin sold by Yan contained insufficient units and contained bacteria and toxicity. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government ordered the Tianjin Municipal Public Health Bureau to ban this counterfeit tetanus antitoxin and investigate the manufacturer. However, after receiving this official letter, the criminal Bao suppressed it and did not handle it for more than a year.
    After the struggle against traitorous merchants began, the criminals Yan and Bao still refused to confess after being reported by citizens. The Municipal People's Court arrested the two criminals Yan and Bao a few days ago for investigation and prosecution. (Xinhua News Agency)

    奸商阎和纯伪造破伤风血清毒害人民
    经天津市民群众检举已由市人民法院逮捕究办
    奸商阎和纯灭绝人性，大量伪造破伤风血清出售，毒害人民，经市民群众向天津市人民政府公共卫生局节约检查委员会检举，并经该会调查属实，现已由市人民法院将阎犯和包庇阎犯出售伪破伤风血清的公共卫生局药政科职员包文滁逮捕，将依法严惩。
    阎犯曾任国民党匪军军医，解放后不务正业，以倒卖西药为业。一九四九年，阎犯利欲薰心，竟丧心病狂，和他的女儿阎淑贞在天津市华昌货栈楼上的一间小屋里，连续伪制大批质量不纯、含有毒性的破伤风血清，并假称是“新华血清菌苗厂”（根本没有这个厂）出品，大量向外地推销。据目前不完全统计，该犯先后售出的“破伤风血清”共达一万三千五百八十九支，骗得人民币一亿二千六百多万元，对于人民生命的危害现尚无法计算。
    阎犯以贿赂手段结识了公共卫生局药政科职员包文滁。包犯受了阎犯的贿赂，竟不顾人民利益，包庇阎犯制造假药。一九五○年十二月，中央生物制品研究所已研究出阎犯所卖的破伤风血清所含的单位不够，并含有杂菌及毒性；中央人民政府卫生部曾命令天津市公共卫生局取缔这种伪制的破伤风血清，并查究制造人。但包犯得此公函后，压了下来，一年多未加以办理。
    反对奸商斗争开展后，经市民检举，阎、包两犯仍拒不坦白，市人民法院即于日前将阎、包两犯逮捕究办。（新华社）
