    Section Chief Zhao's Flashlight
    Li Dageng
    Many comrades have flashlights. It's a very ordinary daily necessity; you shine it in the dark when you need it, and toss it aside during the day. It's not something precious.
    Section Chief Zhao in our organization also has a flashlight like many others. However, it's not very pretty: the recessed parts of the flashlight case are noticeably black, and the protruding parts are a deep yellow; the corners of the polygonal lamp head have been worn smooth. The "lamp bowl" on the lamp head is rusty, and even with new batteries, it's not very bright. The year before last, when passing through Chengdu, Section Chief Zhao spent a thousand yuan to ask a flashlight repairman to replace it with a new "lamp bowl"; this restored the flashlight to its original brightness.
    This flashlight is still an old thing that Section Chief Zhao bought from someone after the Jinzhong Campaign in 1948. Over the years, it has accompanied Section Chief Zhao in fighting, working, and studying. Fighting Yan Xishan, chasing Ma Bufang, and pursuing Hu Zongnan. From North China to Southwest China, from mountain gullies to cities, from the People's Liberation War to the Resist America, Aid Korea Movement. In appearance, the flashlight has already become a "copper stick." The "copper stick" aroused the suspicion of the young messenger: "Section Chief, why don't you buy a good-looking one? You're a section chief, still using such a 'copper stick,' it's really not presentable!" "What does it matter, comrade? Can't the 'copper stick' still be used? Everything we have is the blood and sweat of the people, we must cherish them." Section Chief Zhao then took off the fountain pen from his pocket and said: "This pen was bought in Zuoquan County, Taihang, in 1940 for fifteen border currency. After replacing it with this new nib, doesn't it still write materials and take notes?"
    Yes, Section Chief Zhao also carefully preserves a dry food bag that was issued five or six years ago. The mice have gnawed a few holes, and he has sewn them up with thread. He believes that it is a combat tool given to him by the people. The battle is not over, and there are still enemies in the world. When the motherland needs him, he will immediately carry this dry food bag again.
    That's how it is: although he has entered the city, the surrounding "glamorous world" has not eroded his ideology, and he has consistently maintained a revolutionary style. Section Chief Zhao is a loyal Communist Party member, and under the education of the Party, he deeply understands that the happy life of the people is much more important than his own material enjoyment, and the interests of the motherland are above all else.

    赵科长的手电
    李打更
    手电，好多同志都有。这是件很平常的日用品，黑夜需要的时候照一下，白天随便扔在一边，不是什么贵重的东西。
    我们机关里的赵科长也有和许多人所有的那样一只手电。可是，很不漂亮：电筒壳壳上凹进去的部分显着黑色，凸出来的地方发出深黄色；多角形灯头的棱角，已经磨得光滑了。灯头上的“灯碗”生了锈，新电池装进去也不明亮了。前年路过成都时，赵科长花了一千块钱，请修理手电的工人给换了一个新“灯碗”；这样，手电又恢复了原来的光明。
    这只手电，还是一九四八年在晋中战役结束后，赵科长从人家手里转买来的旧家伙。几年来，伴随着赵科长战斗、工作、学习。打阎锡山，撵马步芳、追胡宗南。从华北打到西南，从山沟进驻城市，从人民解放战争用到抗美援朝运动。手电在外观上，业已变成“铜棒”了。“铜棒”，引起了小鬼通讯员的怀疑：“科长，你怎么不买只好看的呢？科长嘛，还使这样一个‘铜棒’，真不体面！” “这有什么关系呢，同志？‘铜棒’还不是一样能够使用吗？我们身上的东西都是人民的血汗，我们要爱惜它们。”赵科长又摘下他口袋上的钢笔说：“这管钢笔还是一九四○年，在太行左权县，十五块边币买的呢。换上现在这个新笔尖，不是照样写材料、作笔记么？”
    是的，赵科长还小心地保存着一条五、六年前发的干粮袋。老鼠咬了几个窟窿，他又用线缝了缝。他认为那是人民交给他的战斗工具。战斗并没有结束，世界上还有着敌人。当祖国需要他的时候，他马上还要背起这干粮袋的。
    就是这样：尽管进了城，周围的“花花世界”却并没有侵蚀他的思想意识，他一贯地保持着革命的作风。赵科长是一个忠诚的共产党员，在党的教育下，他深深地了解：人民的幸福生活比自己的物质享受重要得多，祖国的利益是高于一切的。
