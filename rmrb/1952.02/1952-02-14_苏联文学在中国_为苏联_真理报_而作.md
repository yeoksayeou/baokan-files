    Soviet Literature in China
    —Written for the Soviet "Pravda"
    Cao Jinghua
    Soviet literature, just like the October Revolution, is seen as a monstrous flood in capitalist countries. The rulers spare no effort to blockade, prohibit, and isolate it. In China under reactionary rule, there was no exception. The Chinese reactionary rulers, from the Zhili-Fengtian warlords to Chiang Kai-shek, were all like this. After the October Revolution, the Zhili-Fengtian warlords explicitly forbade all books, newspapers, and periodicals containing terms like "Bolshevik," "Marx," or "Lenin." After Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the Great Revolution in 1927, he intensified his efforts, banning books and periodicals containing terms like "Russia," "Soviet Russia," "Soviet Union," "class," or "materialism." They even banned the hammer and sickle on book covers, as well as the colors black and red. These were colors that Mr. Lu Xun liked to use at the time, black representing steel and red symbolizing revolution, so they were also banned.
    Chiang Kai-shek not only closed progressive bookstores and confiscated progressive books and periodicals, but also arrested and killed progressive writers. Writers such as Hu Yepin, Rou Shi, and Feng Keng were all murdered in this way. After 1932, in addition to these methods, he also adopted a policy of "economic blockade." That is: prohibiting bookstores from publishing progressive books, and prohibiting newspapers and periodicals from publishing any works by progressive writers, so as to trap and starve the writers to death. However, this policy of starvation and acts of killing could not subdue or intimidate Chinese revolutionary literary workers. With the spirit of not being moved by poverty or subjugated by force, they shouldered the arduous task and marched forward under the banner of Chairman Mao, on the path indicated by the proletarian vanguard—the Communist Party of China. As Chairman Mao said: "A single spark can start a prairie fire, and communism is irresistible!"

    The October Revolution pointed out a path to the liberation of oppressed people all over the world. Stalin said in "The International Character of the October Revolution": "The victory of the October Revolution is a fundamental shift in human history, a fundamental shift in the historical destiny of world capitalism, a fundamental shift in the world proletariat's liberation movement, and a fundamental shift in the methods and organizational forms, customs and traditions, culture and ideology of the masses of the exploited throughout the world."
    The victory of the October Revolution also played a guiding and inspiring role in the liberation of the Chinese people. Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship":
    "The Chinese found Marxism through the introduction of the Russians. Before the October Revolution, the Chinese did not know Lenin or Stalin, nor did they know Marx or Engels. The October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism with a bang. The October Revolution helped the advanced elements of the world, and also helped the advanced elements of China, to use the proletarian worldview as a tool to observe the destiny of the country and to reconsider their own problems. Taking the road of the Russians—this is the conclusion."
    The October Revolution guided the Chinese revolution and achieved a great victory. Soviet literature, which emerged on the basis of the global nature of the October Revolution and the achievements of socialist construction, has had a profound and broad influence on the Chinese revolution and Chinese literature, surpassing that of any other country's literature in the world.
    Mr. Lu Xun, whom Chairman Mao called "the greatest and most heroic standard-bearer of China's modern 'new cultural army'" and "the chief general of China's cultural revolution," was also influenced by the October Revolution and Soviet literature, which led him step by step onto the path of Marxism-Leninism, becoming a communist, making him regard literature as a weapon of class struggle and social transformation, and making him use literary weapons to fight for the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people throughout his life. In his article "Congratulations on the Exchange of Chinese and Russian Writings" written in 1932, he called "Soviet literature victorious in world literature"; and regarded "Russian literature and Soviet literature as our teachers and friends." Under the persecution of the Kuomintang, Mr. Lu Xun enthusiastically promoted Soviet literature, translated "The Rout", proofread and printed "The Iron Flood", "Cement" and "Collection of Twenty Soviet Writers", etc. He wanted to use all means to introduce excellent Soviet literature to China to educate thousands upon thousands of Chinese people and fight for the sacred cause of liberation. He compared the work of introducing Soviet literature to Chinese readers to Prometheus stealing fire from heaven for mankind. Under the bloody rule of Chiang Kai-shek, he likened this work to smuggling munitions to rebellious slaves.
    Comrade Qu Qiubai, the pioneer of Chinese proletarian literature, believed in his letter to Mr. Lu Xun that "introducing Soviet literature is one of the important tasks of Chinese proletarian literature workers" and "is the responsibility of all Chinese revolutionary writers."
    Under the Kuomintang's white terror, the pioneers of Chinese revolutionary literature, Mr. Lu Xun and Comrade Qu Qiubai, and other revolutionary literary workers, under the illumination of the collective wisdom of the Communist Party and under the guidance of Chairman Mao, were not afraid of difficulties and persecution, recognized the future, affirmed their goals, blazed trails, cut through thorns, and regarded the introduction of Soviet literature as an important, revolutionary political task, and engaged in this solemn and sacred work with the spirit of martyrdom.

    Soviet writers, especially Gorky's name, are known to everyone in China. Almost all of his works have been translated into Chinese. According to incomplete statistics, there are about 150 kinds of his works in Chinese single editions. From ancient times to the present, there is no second writer in the world who is so popular in China. Mr. Lu Xun said: "Gorky's greatness is unmatched, in my opinion." His works have an unparalleled influence on the broad masses of the Chinese people, especially young writers. His works are recited by people from all walks of life in China; his play "The Lower Depths" is staged in major cities in China; films made based on his works, such as "My Childhood", "My Universities", "In the World", and "Mother", are universally welcomed by Chinese audiences. Each of his works often has four or five translations, and "The Lower Depths" has ten translations. This is a rare example in the history of Chinese literature.
    Recently, the People's Literature Publishing House, in order to provide readers with more reliable, systematic, and artistically perfect translations, is planning to compile a selection of Gorky's works.
    For more than 30 years, major Soviet literary works from various periods have been introduced to China like a torrent. Among them, "The Rout" and "The Iron Flood" were introduced earlier and had the greatest impact. Comrade Qu Qiubai said in a letter to Mr. Lu Xun that the introduction of these two books to China was a major event in the literary world at that time and was worthy of celebration. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yan'an reprinted "The Iron Flood" in several editions, and almost every veteran cadre who participated in the Long March had a copy, which almost became a textbook for the army. Zong Geng published an article on the "Tianjin Daily" on September 26, 1949, entitled "How Soviet Literature Educated Us," saying that young Chinese people's revolutionary literature grew up directly under the influence of Soviet literature, which was not only a creative education, but also related to the revolutionary actions of young people. The generation of young students before and after the Chinese Revolution often approached the revolution because they liked literature. They were moved by Soviet literary works, harbored the will to resist, and embarked on the journey. Some of these young people sacrificed in the revolutionary struggle, some are taking on major tasks today, and some have become people's writers. It is estimated that there are no Chinese writers who belong to the people who have not been influenced by Soviet literature.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Third Civil Revolutionary War, these Soviet literary works played an unparalleled inspiring role in China. Especially Simonov's "Days and Nights", Grossman's "The People Are Immortal", and Beck's "Fear and Courage" (also translated as "The Open Road"), etc. Yao Yuanfang said in an article published in the first volume and third issue of "Literary Gazette" that "Soviet wartime literature has become our invisible military force," and that these works were read by almost everyone in the People's Liberation Army, from senior generals to junior commanders. They not only regarded these literary works as extremely valuable literary works, but also regarded them as valuable military textbooks, and studied them as Marxist-Leninist military science. He cited an example, saying that General Teng Daiyuan, Deputy Commander of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, stipulated that "Days and Nights" and "Fear and Courage" were required reading for cadres above the regimental level. Generals Liu Bocheng and Xu Xiangqian, and others, all called on the troops to study these works. In their speeches, in military training, and in the conference studying campaigns, they all cited examples and viewpoints from these works to criticize the unhealthy tendencies of "only relying on courage and not paying attention to tactics" in the troops that did not pay attention to discipline and training.
    Yao Yuanfang cited another example in the same article, saying that in the battle to capture Shijiazhuang, General Nie Rongzhen's troops specifically studied the chapter in "Days and Nights" that describes Shaburov directing the house-to-house fighting in Stalingrad. In the Taiyuan campaign, General Xu Xiangqian's troops similarly printed this chapter into battlefield leaflets and distributed them to the troops engaged in street fighting.
    Gorbachev's "The Unvanquished" and Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered" also played a huge role in China. For example, Chinese writer Yang Shuo's novel "Looking at Nanshan" was deeply influenced by Gorbachev. Comrade Kang Zhuo mentioned in an article published in "Literary Gazette" that a young worker wrote in his diary after reading "How the Steel Was Tempered":
    "I swear to learn from Paul Korchagin." The China Youth Art Theater staged a play adapted from this book at the Beijing Youth Palace last spring, and it was performed for nearly three months, and many viewers still found it difficult to buy tickets.
    In terms of poetry, poems by Mayakovsky, Bedny, Bezymensky, Jambyl, Surkov, Twardovsky, Isakovsky, Jan Kubala, Isaac Yang, and other poets have all become things that Chinese readers love and recite.
    Famous Soviet plays, such as Simonov's "The Russian Question", Korneichuk's "The Front", Safronov's "Moscow Character", and Lavrenyov's "The Voice of the American People", have not only been translated into Chinese, but have also been brought to the Chinese stage and have been loved by the broad audience.
    Soviet films, such as "Chapayev", "Nightingale Song", "Michurin", "Stone Flower", "The Battle of Stalingrad", "The Fall of Berlin" and other films, not only gave Chinese audiences the deepest impression, but also became an inseparable part of the Chinese people's cultural and entertainment life.
    In terms of children's literature, Lu Xun's translation of Panteleev's "Watch" is not only popular throughout the country, but also adapted into a play and brought to the stage. Other works such as M. Ilyin's and A. Gaidar's works have almost all been translated into Chinese. Kataev's "The Magic Flower" not only has an illustrated single edition, but also has been adapted into comic strips based on this story for children who are just learning to read.
    In short, Soviet literature, the most advanced, richest, and most politically educational in the world, has influenced not only the thinking of the Chinese youth generation for more than 30 years, but also their revolutionary actions. Countless young Chinese people were inspired and encouraged by reading Soviet literary works, and then joined the revolutionary ranks and participated in the actual struggle of the revolution.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the guerrilla areas of the Taihang Mountains, in the extremely difficult enemy rear, short stories and novellas by Sholokhov, Lavrenyov, Ehrenburg, and others were mimeographed and reprinted. At that time, the revolutionary soldiers in the enemy rear combined these mimeographed works with guns and their own lives into a trinity. When encountering a critical moment of life and death, everything they carried with them could be discarded, only books and guns, in the critical moment of life and death, either rushed out of the encirclement of death to take them away, or perished with their own lives!
    The influence of Soviet literature on the broad masses of the Chinese people is simply unparalleled. For decades, it has armed the Chinese people, expelled the imperialism that had occupied China for more than a hundred years under the banner of Mao Zedong, and destroyed the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, liberating the Chinese people. It is still arming the Chinese people, and will achieve more brilliant victories in defending world peace, opposing the US imperialist war of aggression, and building a new China!
    Author's Note: Last winter, I accompanied a writers' delegation in Moscow and rushed to draft this article at the invitation of Pravda, which was published in Pravda on November 22, 1951. Now I will slightly delete and simplify the Chinese manuscript and publish it domestically, hoping that readers will correct it.

    苏联文学在中国
    ——为苏联“真理报”而作
    曹靖华
    苏联文学，在资本主义国家中，也如同十月革命一样，被看作洪水猛兽，统治者用尽方法，对它加以封锁、禁止和隔绝。在反动统治时代的中国，也没有例外。中国反动统治者，从直奉军阀起，一直到蒋介石，都是如此的。十月革命后，直奉军阀就明令禁止一切凡有“布尔什维克”、“马克思”、“列宁”等名词的书报刊物。一九二七年蒋介石叛变了大革命之后，更变本加厉，凡有“俄”、“苏俄”、“苏联”、“阶级”、“唯物论”等名词的书刊，也都被禁止了。而且还禁到书刊封面上的锤子镰刀，以及黑红的颜色。这是鲁迅先生当时喜用的颜色，黑色代表钢铁，红色象征革命，所以也遭到了禁止。
    蒋介石不但封闭当时的进步书店，没收进步书刊，甚至对进步作家，也加以捕杀。胡也频、柔石、冯铿等作家，都是这样被害的。一九三二年后，除用这些方法之外，还采用“经济封锁”政策。那就是：禁止书店出版进步的书籍，禁止报刊登载进步作家的任何作品，使作家困死，以至饿死。可是这种饿死政策和捕杀暴行，并不能使中国革命文艺工作者降服，或把他们吓退。他们本着贫贱不能移，威武不能屈的精神，肩起艰巨的任务，在毛主席的旗帜下，在无产阶级先锋队——中国共产党所指示的大道上挺进。这诚如毛主席所说：“星星之火，可以燎原，共产主义是不可抗拒的！”
    ★    ★    ★
    十月革命给全世界被压迫人民的解放，指示了一条道路。斯大林在“十月革命底国际性质”中说：“十月革命的胜利是人类史中的根本转变，是世界资本主义历史命运中的根本转变，是世界无产阶级解放运动中的根本转变，是全世界被剥削群众底斗争方法和组织形式、风俗和传统、文化和思想体系中的根本转变。”
    十月革命的胜利，对中国人民的解放，也同样起了指示和鼓舞的作用。毛主席在“论人民民主专政”中说：
    “中国人找到马克思主义，是经过俄国人介绍的。在十月革命以前，中国人不但不知道列宁，斯大林，也不知道马克思，恩格斯。十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。十月革命帮助了全世界的也帮助了中国的先进分子，用无产阶级的宇宙观作为观察国家命运的工具，重新考虑自己的问题。走俄国人的路——这就是结论。”
    十月革命引导中国革命，获得了伟大胜利。在十月革命世界性的基础上和社会主义建设的成就上产生出来的苏联文学，对中国革命和中国文学影响的深刻和宽广，为世界任何国家的文学所不及。
    毛主席称为中国现代“文化新军的最伟大与最英勇的旗手”、“中国文化革命的主将”鲁迅先生，也是受了十月革命和苏联文学的影响，使他一步步地走上马克思列宁主义的道路，成为一个共产主义者，使他把文学当作阶级斗争和社会改造的武器，使他用文学武器，为中国人民解放事业而奋斗一生。他在一九三二年写的“祝中俄文字之交”一文中，称“苏联文学在世界文学上是胜利的”；把“俄国文学和苏联文学看作我们的导师和朋友”。在国民党迫害下，鲁迅先生热情地宣传苏联文学，译了“毁灭”，校印了“铁流”、“士敏土”及“苏联作家二十人集”等，他要用一切方法，把优秀的苏联文学介绍到中国，去教养千千万万的中国人民，为神圣的解放事业而斗争。他把介绍苏联文学给中国读者的工作，比作普罗米修士偷天火给人类
    一样地看待。在蒋介石的血腥统治下，他又把这种工作比作给起义的奴隶偷运军火。
    中国无产阶级文学的开路人瞿秋白同志，在给鲁迅先生的信中，认为“介绍苏联文学是中国无产阶级文学者重要任务之一”，“是一切中国革命文学家的责任”。
    在国民党的白色恐怖下，中国革命文学的先驱者鲁迅先生和瞿秋白同志以及其他革命文学工作者，在共产党集体智慧的照耀下，在毛主席的指引下，不畏艰险和迫害，认清前途，肯定目标，辟道路，斩荆棘，把介绍苏联文学看作重大的、革命的政治任务，以殉教者的精神，来从事这一庄严神圣的工作。
    ★    ★    ★
    苏联的作家，特别是高尔基的名字，在中国是妇孺皆知的。他的作品，几乎全部译成了中文。据不完全的统计，他的作品，中文的单行本，约在一百五十种左右。自古及今，世界作家，在中国这样风行的，没有第二人。鲁迅先生说：“高尔基之伟大，我看无人可比”。他的作品，对中国广大群众，尤其是青年作家的影响，简直是无比的。他的作品，中国各阶层的人，都在传诵着；他的剧本“夜店”，在中国各大城市上演；根据他的作品制成的影片，如：“我的童年”、“我的大学”、“在人间”、“母亲”，中国观众是普遍欢迎的。他的作品，每种往往有四五个译本，而“夜店”就有十个译本。这是中国文学史上少有的例子。
    最近人民文学出版社为了使广大读者得到更可靠，更有系统，艺术上更完善的译本，正在筹划编译高尔基选集。
    三十多年以来，苏联各时期的主要文学作品，就像洪流似的，被介绍到中国。其中介绍得较早，而影响最大的是“毁灭”和“铁流”。瞿秋白同志在给鲁迅先生的信中说这两部书介绍到中国，是当时文坛上的大事，是值得庆贺的。在抗战期间，延安将“铁流”翻印了好几版，参加长征的老干部，几乎人手一册，几乎成了部队的教科书。纵耕同志在一九四九年九月二十六日“天津日报”上发表了一篇“苏联文学怎样教育了我们”，他说年青的中国人民革命文学，直接在苏联文学的影响下成长起来，这不只是创作上的教养，而且也联系着青年们的革命的行动。中国大革命前后的一代青年学生，常常是因为喜好文学，接近了革命。他们从苏联的文学作品里，受到了激动，怀着反抗的意志，走上征途。这些青年，有的在革命斗争中牺牲了，有的今天担任着重大的任务，有的成为人民的作家。中国属于人民的作家，没有受过苏联文学影响的，恐怕是没有的。
    在抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争中间，苏联这些文学作品，在中国都起了无比的鼓舞作用。尤其是西蒙诺夫的“日日夜夜”，格罗斯曼的“人民是不朽的”，别克的“恐惧与无畏”（另译为“康庄大道”）等。姚远方在一卷三期“文艺报”发表的“苏维埃战时文学成了我们无形的军事力量”一文中，曾说到这些作品在解放军中，从高级将领，直到下级指挥员，几乎无人不读。他们不仅把这些文学作品看成极有价值的文学作品，而且也把它们看作宝贵的军事教科书，当作马克思列宁主义的军事学来研究。他曾举例说，晋冀鲁豫军区副司令员滕代远将军曾把“日日夜夜”和“恐惧与无畏”，规定为团以上干部必读书籍。刘伯承将军及徐向前将军等都曾号召部队来研究这些作品。在他们的演讲中，在军事训练中，在研究战役的会议上，都曾引证这些作品中的例子和观点，来批判部队中不重视纪律，不重视训练的“只凭勇气，不讲战术”的不良倾向。
    姚远方在同一文中又举例说，在石家庄的攻坚战中，聂荣臻将军的部队，专门研究了“日日夜夜”中描写沙布洛夫指挥斯大林格勒的逐屋战的一章。徐向前将军的部队在太原战役中，同样的将这一章印成战场传单，发给担任巷战的部队。
    郭尔巴托夫的“宁死不屈”和奥斯特洛夫斯基的“钢铁是怎样炼成的”两部名著，在中国也起了巨大的作用。如中国作家杨朔的小说“望南山”就深受了郭尔巴托夫的影响。康濯同志在“文艺报”上发表的一篇文章中曾提到有一个青年工人，在看了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”以后，在自己的日记本上写道：
    “我发誓要向保尔·柯察金学习。”中国青年艺术剧院去年春天在北京青年宫上演根据这本书所编的剧本，一直演了近三个月，而且许多观众还是不容易购到票。
    在诗歌方面，如马雅可夫斯基，别德内伊，别兹明斯基，江布尔，苏尔科夫，特瓦尔多夫斯基，伊沙柯夫斯基，杨·库巴拉，伊沙克·杨以及其他诗人的诗，都成了中国广大读者所喜爱，所传诵的东西。
    苏联的著名剧本，如西蒙诺夫的“俄罗斯问题”，柯涅邱克的“前线”，沙甫朗诺夫的“莫斯科性格”，拉甫列涅夫的“美国人民的呼声”等，不但都已译成中文，而且都搬上了中国舞台，得到广大观众的爱好。
    苏联的电影，如“夏伯阳”，“夜莺曲”，“米丘林”，“宝石花”，“斯大林格勒大血战”，“攻克柏林”及其他影片，不但给了中国广大观众最深刻的印象，而且成了中国人民文化娱乐生活的血肉相连的不可分的部分。
    在儿童文学方面，鲁迅译的斑泰列夫的“表”，不但风行全国，而且改编成剧本，搬上了舞台。其他如姆·伊林及阿·葛达尔的作品，几乎都全译成了中文。卡达耶夫的“七色花”，不但出了插图单本，而且还根据这故事，改编成连环图画，供给初识字的儿童看。
    总之，世界上最前进、最丰富、最有政治教育内容的苏联文学，三十多年以来，不但影响了中国青年一代的思想，而且也影响了他们的革命行动。广大的中国青年，最初读了苏联的文学作品，受到了启发和鼓舞，投入革命行列，参加了革命的实际斗争，这是不可以数计的。
    在抗日战争中间，在太行山一带的游击区内，在极端艰险的敌人后方，曾经用油印翻版了萧洛霍夫，拉甫列涅夫，爱伦堡等的短篇小说和中篇小说。当时敌后的革命战士，把这些油印的作品和枪及自己的生命，结成了三位一体，遇到生死关头，随身携带的一切，都可以抛弃，书和枪，唯有书和枪，在生死关头里，或则冲出死的重围，把它带走，或则和自己的生命同归于尽！
    苏联文学，对中国广大群众的影响，简直是无比的。数十年来，它武装了中国人民，在毛泽东旗帜下，驱逐了盘据中国百余年的帝国主义，摧毁了国民党的反动统治，使中国人民获得了解放。它还在武装着中国人民，在保卫世界和平，反对美国帝国主义侵略战争及新中国的建设上，将获得更辉煌的胜利！
