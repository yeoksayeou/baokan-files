The Collapse of the "Conspiracy of Silence"
    ——An Account of Engineer Liu Shiming's Confession of Embezzlement
    Qi Huayao
    Liu Shiming was an engineer at a state-owned construction company in Beijing. Since 1950, he had been using his position to collude with private merchants, accepting bribes from many private construction firms, totaling over 40 million yuan. For example, in 1950, when the Chadian State-owned Qinghe Farm was building houses, Liu Shiming was the chief engineer, and he used his position to provide many conveniences to the private Zhongsheng Construction Company and Daxing Heji Construction Company. At that time, Zhongsheng Construction Company bought a batch of very poor-quality stones that could not be used to build houses. However, Liu Shiming allowed Zhongsheng Construction Company to use some of them to repair the walls. At that time, the farm wanted to build two more houses, located within the construction site of another construction company. In principle, this construction company should have been contracted to build them, but Liu Shiming gave the contract to Zhongsheng Construction Company, allowing Zhongsheng Construction Company to use all the remaining inferior stones from before. When the main roof support (made of three pieces of wood clamped together) broke, Liu Shiming did not ask Zhongsheng Construction Company to replace it. Because Zhongsheng Construction Company had obtained the opportunity to steal state wealth through him, they invited him to take a bath, eat fruit, and offer a bribe of 5 million yuan when the project was completed. In this project, Liu Shiming also colluded with the private Daxing Heji Construction Company and accepted a bribe of 10 million yuan.
    When the company launched the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, leading cadres called on embezzlers to confess voluntarily, and explained that if they confessed voluntarily, those with serious crimes would be treated leniently, and those with minor crimes would be exempted from punishment. At this time, should he confess, or not confess? Liu Shiming began a fierce ideological struggle. He thought, if I confess, I will really lose face; I have been an engineer for decades, built so many large buildings, if I confess, wouldn't my status and reputation be ruined? How would I face people? Besides, what if I go to jail? At this time, Bian Xianlin, the manager of Daxing Heji Construction Company, who had bribed him 10 million yuan, came to see him from Tianjin to establish a "conspiracy of silence" with him. Bian Xianlin said to him: "What we did in Zhuozhou is likely to be exposed (reported), but what we did at Qinghe Farm is no problem. If you don't tell, no one will know. If you tell, it will be bad for me, and bad for you too." Finally, Bian Xianlin stuck out his neck and said: "I would rather lose my head than say anything." Then, Jiao Guoying, the manager of Juxingyong Construction Company, also came to see him. Jiao Guoying had given him ten bags of flour, a bag of rice, several bottles of vitamin pills, and helped him repair his house. Jiao Guoying repeatedly said to him: "The flour and money are all from my personal account, and the vitamin pills are from the worker's hospital account, so it can't be found out. Even if I am arrested, I won't say anything." When Liu Shiming saw that the unscrupulous merchants had made a "guarantee," he felt that there was no need to confess.
    However, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was vigorously developing in all strata, and the masses of the company were also mobilized. Although Liu Shiming had made several "conspiracies of silence," there were some he hadn't! He thought: "If I am exposed, it will be terrible." After thinking it over, he felt that it was best to talk about the issues that were most likely to be exposed. He believed that this would both eliminate suspicion against him and avoid being exposed. So, he nervously talked to the leading cadres about the first problem—accepting bribes of twenty bags of flour and a bag of rice.
    After this, Liu Shiming's heart was not lighter, but heavier. He thought, what if I have made a mistake and deceived my superiors, and it is found out? When he went to work, he was drawing diagrams in the design department, but his mind was always thinking about the two words "embezzlement." Next door, the leading cadres were talking about anti-corruption. When Liu Shiming heard the words "incorrigible corruption," his heart ached like a knife. "Others were never corrupt from the moment they were born, but I am a corrupt rogue, how shameful!" He could not continue to work.
    One Sunday, Liu Shiming read newspapers all day at home, read Comrade Gao Gang's report, and read many reports about the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. His mind was full of thoughts, and he could not eat. In the evening, after the children were asleep, he was still pondering: should he stand on the revolutionary position, or on its opposite? To live or to die? Suddenly, a thought flashed through his mind, and he remembered that the only way out for corrupt elements, as stated in the newspapers, was to confess. So he decided to jump out of the trap of the "conspiracy of silence" newly set up by the unscrupulous merchants, and mustered up the courage to write a report. But when he wrote about accepting a bribe of 10 million yuan at one time, he put down his pen. "Will I go to jail?" He was afraid, and hesitated again.
    After a fierce ideological struggle, he decided to write down all the facts of his embezzlement. His body was already weak, and coupled with the mental anguish of several days, he couldn't hold on. He gave himself three injections of cardiac stimulant before he could write down the facts of his embezzlement. The next morning, he took the written report and ran to the leading cadres to confess. To his surprise, the leading cadres welcomed his confession, comforted him not to be sad, and told him to go back and rest well.
    When he returned home, he felt as if a thousand-pound stone had been lifted from his heart. With this, his courage also came. At first, he did not dare to say these things in front of everyone, but now he was able to report in detail the facts of his embezzlement and bribery and his ideological struggle in a meeting of hundreds of people, and he also exposed the bribery behavior of another engineer colluding with a certain merchant. He called on those who had engaged in corruption to honestly confess, put down their burdens, and atone for their crimes.

    “攻守同盟”的瓦解  
    ——记刘世铭工程师坦白贪污行为的经过
    齐华瑶
    刘世铭是北京市某公营建筑公司的工程师。他自一九五○年以来，即利用职权和私商勾结，接受许多家私营营造厂的贿赂，前后共达四千多万元。比如一九五○年茶淀国营清河农场盖房子时，刘世铭担任了总工程师，他便利用职权给私营中盛营造厂和大兴合记营造厂许多方便。当时中盛营造厂买了一批质量很坏的不能用来盖房子的石头。刘世铭却允许中盛营造厂用了一部分来修墙。那时，农场要增建两幢房子，位置在别的营造厂的工地内，照理应由这一家营造厂承建，但刘世铭却把它让给中盛营造厂承建，使中盛营造厂得以利用以前剩下的全部劣质的石头。屋顶大托（用三根木头夹成的）断了，刘世铭不叫中盛营造厂更换。中盛营造厂因为经过他得到了盗窃国家财富的机会，所以在工程完成时，就请他洗澡、吃水果，并行贿五百万元。刘世铭在这个工程中，还和私营大兴合记营造厂勾结，并受贿一千万元。
    当这个公司开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的时候，领导干部曾号召贪污分子自动坦白，并说明如果自动坦白，罪重者从轻处理，轻者免予处分。这时，坦白呢？还是不坦白呢？刘世铭便开始了剧烈的思想斗争。他想，坦白吧，面子上可真下不去；干了几十年工程师啦，盖过多少大建筑啦，这一坦白，身份名誉不就完了吗？还有啥脸见人？再说，如果坐了监狱，又怎么办？正在这个时候，曾经贿赂他一千万元的大兴合记营造厂经理边宪麟由天津来看他，要和他订立“攻守同盟”。边宪麟对他说：“我们涿州的事恐怕要发生（被检举），但在清河农场作的事，则没有问题。你不讲，谁都不知道。你讲了，对我不利，对你也不利。”最后边伸出脖子说：“我掉了脑袋也不说。”接着聚兴永营造厂经理焦国英也来看他。焦国英曾送给他十袋面粉，一包大米，几瓶维他命丸，并帮他修理过房子。焦国英再三地对他说：“面粉和钱都出在我个人账上，维他命丸出在工人医院的账上，查不出来。如果我被抓起来了，也不说。”刘世铭一见奸商作了“保证”，就觉得没有坦白的必要了。
    但是，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动在各阶层中蓬勃地开展起来了，公司的群众也发动起来了。刘世铭虽然订了几个“攻守同盟”，但是有的还没有订啊！他想：“要是被检举出来，可不得了。”他想来想去，觉得还是把最容易暴露的问题谈出来才好。他认为这样既可以免除对他的怀疑，又不怕被检举。于是他提心吊胆地找领导干部谈了第
    一个问题——受贿二十袋面粉，一包大米。
    这以后，刘世铭的心里不是轻松了，而是更沉重了。他想，犯了错误，又欺骗了上级，查出来怎么办？上班了，他在设计部画图，脑袋里却老在想着
    “贪污”两个字。在隔壁，领导干部在谈反贪污的事。刘世铭听到“贪污成性”几个字，心像刀刺一样难过。“人家从娘胎出来就没贪污过，我却是个贪污痞子，多么可耻！”他不能继续工作下去了。
    一个星期日，刘世铭在家里看了一天报纸，读了高岗同志的报告，看了许多有关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的报道，心里千头万绪，饭也吃不下去。晚上，孩子们都睡了，他还在捉摸：是站在革命立场上呢，还是站在它的反面？要死还是要活？突然，脑筋一转，想起了报纸上说的贪污分子的唯一出路是坦白。于是他决心跳出奸商新设的
    “攻守同盟”的圈套，鼓起勇气写材料。但是当写到一次受贿一千万元时，就把笔放下来了。“会不会坐牢？”他害怕，又踌躇起来了。
    经过了激烈的思想斗争，他决定把全部贪污事实写出来。他的身体本来就虚弱，加上一连几天精神上的苦闷，支持不了，自己打了三次强心针，才把贪污事实写出来。第二天早晨，他拿着已写好的材料跑到领导干部那里坦白。出乎他的意料之外，领导干部很欢迎他坦白，安慰他不要难过，回去好好休息。
    他回到家里，心里像放下了千斤的石头一样轻松了。这一来，他的勇气也来了。最初，他不敢在大家面前说这些话，现在他能够在几百人的大会上详细地报告自己贪污受贿的事实和思想斗争经过，并检举了另一工程师和某商人勾结受贿的行为。他号召有贪污行为的人老实坦白，放下包袱，立功赎罪。
