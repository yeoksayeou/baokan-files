    American Aggressors Fear the Truth About the Korean Invasion Will Be Revealed
    Prepare to Detain American POWs After the Armistice

At the Korean negotiation table, the American representatives put on a show of "caring for prisoners of war and their families," while the U.S. Department of Justice is preparing concentration camps for those American POWs who will be released and sent home after the armistice. It is reported that former WWII POW camps in Florence, Arizona; El Reno, Oklahoma; and Tule Lake, California, as well as the former air base in Wickenburg, Arizona, all heavily guarded, will become new prisons for American soldiers who are about to gain freedom and reunite with their families. According to a January 21st United Press dispatch, the aforementioned measures by the U.S. Department of Justice are being taken according to the instructions of the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. The instructions state that American POWs' "views on the purpose of the Korean War may differ from the official views;" and may spread news about North Korea and China. Therefore, all released soldiers must be confined in concentration camps, isolated from the outside world, and participate in "loyalty" tests under the supervision of representatives from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. The instructions state that this matter can be carried out under the McCarran Internal Security Act, which means that if released American soldiers express dissatisfaction with the American war of aggression against Korea and have a correct understanding of North Korea and China, they will be considered "guilty."

    美侵略者害怕侵朝真相被揭穿
    准备停战后把美俘拘禁起来
    【新华社五日讯】在朝鲜谈判会议桌上，美国代表摆出一付“关心战俘及其家庭”的面孔，而美国司法部却正着手为那些停战后将被释放回家的美国战俘准备集中营。据悉美国亚利桑那州的福罗伦斯、俄克拉荷马州的艾利·雷诺、加利福尼亚州的丘尔湖等地的第二次世界大战期中的战俘营，以及亚利桑那州威肯堡的前航空基地，这些禁卫森严的地方都将成为拘禁那些即将获得自由和与家庭团聚机会的美国士兵的新监狱。据一月二十一日电通社讯，上述美国司法部的措置，是根据美国参议院国内安全小组委员会的指令而采取的，该指令说，美军战俘“对于朝鲜战争的宗旨的看法可能和官方的看法不同”；而且可能传播有关北朝鲜和中国的消息，因此，将被释放的一切士兵，必须关进集中营与外界隔绝，并在美国司法部和参院国内安全小组委员会的代表监督下参加“忠诚”试验。指令说明此事可根据麦卡伦国内安全法来进行，这就意味着：如果被释放的美国士兵对美国侵略朝鲜的战争表示不满和对北朝鲜与中国有正确的认识，就会被认为“有罪”。
