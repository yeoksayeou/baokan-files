I represent the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government and the China Animal By-Products Company in accusing the major embezzler Xue Kunshan of using his position to steal a large amount of state property.

Xue Kunshan is from Xuexiang Village, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, with a landlord background, and is currently 41 years old. He formerly served as the Deputy Director of the Business Department of the China Animal By-Products Company.

Before 1945, Xue Kunshan was an ordinary fur merchant in Zhangjiakou with only 200 bolts of cloth as capital. During the first liberation of Zhangjiakou in 1945, he and the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Trade Company jointly operated the Fuyihe Fur Shop. At that time, public shares accounted for 85% and private shares accounted for 15%. After the liberation of Zhangjiakou in 1949, the Fuyihe Fur Shop was closed in June 1950, and Xue Kunshan took the opportunity to infiltrate the China Fur Company, and in April 1951, he became the Deputy Director of the Business Department of the China Animal By-Products Company. When Xue Kunshan co-operated with the state in the fur shop, he used state funds for speculation and profiteering, and stole a large amount of state funds and property, operating and investing in ten fur shops.

After he infiltrated the state-owned trading organization, he continued to use his authority to steal state secrets, direct his own business firms, monopolize fur prices, speculate and profiteer, and seek exorbitant profits. Over the past three years, Xue Kunshan's main crimes are as follows:

(1) From the second half of 1949 to the first half of 1950, Xue Kunshan purchased more than 3 million catties of wool on behalf of the China Fur Company. In every 100 catties of wool, 10 to 20 catties of soil were mixed in. When delivering the goods, he bribed the China Fur Company's receiving personnel, Ma Zifeng, Zhu Fengming, Lü Enrong, etc., to accept this batch of bad wool as good wool, defrauding the state of more than 2 billion RMB in assets.

(2) When the Fuyihe Fur Shop closed in 1950, Xue Kunshan organized some employees of Fuyihe to collectively embezzle 100 million RMB, 1,200 bolts of white cloth, 43 taels of gold, and more than 1,200 shares of public bonds.

(3) During the period of co-operation between Xue Kunshan and the state-owned fur industry, he used state funds to engage in private transactions and invested the profits in ten fur shops, totaling more than 180 million RMB.

(4) In January 1950, the state-owned Fur Company and Xue Kunshan went to Lanzhou to purchase wool in a joint venture. Xue Kunshan personally wrote letters directing his business firms in Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou to purchase large quantities of wool and push up prices, so that the cheap wool purchased in Lanzhou was transported to Tianjin and delivered to the state-owned Fur Company at Tianjin's high price. This joint venture made a total profit of 3.5 billion RMB, and Xue Kunshan received 45%, totaling 1.575 billion RMB.

(5) In August 1950, the China Fur Company decided to increase the price of goatskins by 2,000 RMB per piece. Before the instructions were issued, Xue Kunshan instructed his younger brother to first notify the Zhenxintai Fur Shop in Zhangjiakou, which he invested in, by telephone from Tianjin to purchase a large number of goatskins. By the time the Zhangjiakou Fur Branch received the price increase instructions, the market inventory had been bought up.

(6) In December 1950, the Central People's Government, in order to stabilize prices, ordered the freezing of funds of national government agencies nationwide. The Baotou branch stopped purchasing wool, and local wool prices fell. Xue Kunshan took this opportunity to instruct his third younger brother to remit 300 million RMB of deposits to Baotou to purchase 49,000 catties of wool, earning a huge profit of 120 million RMB. At the same time, he ordered Wu Zhongsan, the manager of his Tianjin Jinfeng Fur Shop, to purchase more than 18,000 catties of wool in Lanzhou, earning a profit of more than 80 million RMB. The above two cases made a total profit of 200 million RMB.

(7) In September 1951, the China Animal By-Products Company decided to increase the price of camel hair by 20%. Before the instructions were issued, Xue Kunshan ordered the Tianjin Jinfeng Fur Shop, which he invested in, to notify the Deyihneg Fur Shop in Zhangjiakou by telephone to buy up 32,000 catties of camel hair stored by the Inner Mongolia Trade Company, and buy up all the camel hair on the market.

(8) In October 1951, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government decided to implement cattle hide control. Before the order was issued, Xue Kunshan instructed his third younger brother to purchase 400 cattle hides in Zhangjiakou and Baotou and transport them to the Northeast for sale, seeking exorbitant profits.

The above eight points are the main criminal facts of Xue Kunshan.

In total, Xue Kunshan and other accomplices directly stole more than 4 billion RMB of state property during the period of cooperation with state-owned trading companies and after infiltrating the China Fur Company and the China Animal By-Products Company. Xue alone illegally obtained property totaling more than 2.3 billion RMB. As for the losses suffered by the state and the people due to his use of state secrets to direct his invested business firms, disrupt the market, speculate and manipulate, they are several times greater than this, and have not yet been fully calculated. Over the past six years, Xue Kunshan has sucked the blood of the state and the people, fattening himself and transforming himself from an ordinary merchant with only 200 bolts of cloth as capital into a large capitalist investing in 19 business firms. This is the blood debt that Xue Kunshan owes to the state and the people. Today, the people of the whole country have the right to demand the return of these blood debts.

Xue Kunshan is the most ferocious typical example of the bourgeoisie launching a frenzied attack on state-owned trading organizations and all state-owned enterprises. He took advantage of the political paralysis of the leading comrades of the Ministry of Trade of the Central Government, the China Animal By-Products Company, and the China Fur Company, and their lack of vigilance against the attacks of the bourgeoisie, infiltrated state-owned trading enterprises, carried out serious sabotage activities, and caused significant losses to the state and the people. After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, Xue convened his henchmen to a meeting to arrange for denial. When we asked him to confess based on the materials we had already grasped, he refused to confess, but instead carried 480 million RMB in bank checks with him, preparing to escape, which proves that he has no intention of repentance and is determined to be an enemy of the people to the end. Based on the above criminal facts of Xue Kunshan, we request the Supreme People's Court to impose the most severe sanctions.

    中央贸易部副部长姚依林  
    对大贪污犯薛崑山的控诉
    我代表中央人民政府贸易部和中国畜产公司控诉大贪污犯薛崑山利用职权大量盗窃国家财产的罪行。
    薛崑山是山西省平遥县薛香村人，地主成分，现年四十一岁，原任中国畜产公司业务处副处长。
    在一九四五年以前，薛崑山是张家口一个仅有价值二百匹布资本的普通皮毛商人。一九四五年张家口第一次解放时，他和晋察冀边区贸易公司合营福义和皮毛栈，当时公股占百分之八十五，私股占百分之十五。一九四九年张家口解放后，福义和皮毛栈于一九五○年六月结束，薛崑山就乘机钻进了中国皮毛公司，并于一九五一年四月担任中国畜产公司业务处副处长。在薛崑山和国家合营皮毛栈时，他就利用国家资金，投机倒把，大量盗骗国家资财，经营与投资了十处皮毛栈行。
    在他钻进国营贸易机构之后，继续利用职权，盗窃国家机密，指挥他自己的商号，垄断皮毛价格，投机倒把，牟取暴利。三年来，薛崑山主要罪行如下：
    （一）一九四九年下半年至一九五○年上半年，薛崑山代中国皮毛公司购买羊毛三百余万斤，在每百斤羊毛中，掺土十斤至二十斤。交货时，贿赂皮毛公司收货人马子风、朱凤鸣、吕恩荣等把这批坏毛当好毛收进，骗取国家资财人民币二十余亿元。
    （二）一九五○年福义和皮毛栈结束时，薛崑山组织福义和一些职员，集体贪污人民币一亿元，白布一千二百匹，黄金四十三两，公债票一千二百余分。
    （三）薛崑山在与国家合营皮毛业期间，利用国家资金，做私人买卖，将所得利润，投资于十家皮毛行栈，总计一亿八千余万元。
    （四）一九五○年一月国营皮毛公司与薛崑山以合营方式，到兰州收购羊毛。薛崑山亲自写信指挥他在北京、天津、张家口投资的商号，大量抢购羊毛，哄抬价格，使得在兰州买到的贱价的羊毛，运到天津，按天津的高价交给国营皮毛公司。这次合营一共获利三十五亿元，薛崑山分到了百分之四十五，计十五亿七千五百万元。
    （五）一九五○年八月，中国皮毛公司决定山羊板皮每张提价二千元。在指示尚未发出以前，薛崑山令其弟由天津先以电话通知张家口他所投资的振新泰皮毛栈，大量抢购山羊板皮，当张家口皮毛分公司接到提价指示后，市场存货已被买光。
    （六）一九五○年十二月，中央人民政府为了稳定物价，下令冻结全国国家机关的资金，包头分公司停止收购羊毛，当地羊毛价格下跌，薛崑山利用这个机会，指使其三弟，将存款三亿元汇到包头，抢购羊毛四万九千斤，获取暴利一亿二千万元。同时又命令他的天津晋丰皮毛栈经理吴仲三在兰州抢购羊毛一万八千余斤，获利八千余万元。以上两宗共获暴利两亿元。
    （七）一九五一年九月中国畜产公司决定提高驼毛价格百分之二十，在指示尚未发出之前，薛崑山命令他所投资的天津晋丰皮毛栈用电话通知张家口德义恒皮毛栈将内蒙古贸易公司所存驼毛三万二千斤买走，并将市场驼毛抢购一空。
    （八）一九五一年十月，中央人民政府贸易部决定实行牛皮管制，在命令下达以前，薛崑山即指示其三弟在张家口、包头抢购牛皮四百张，急运东北出售，谋取暴利。
    以上八点，是薛崑山主要的犯罪事实。
    总算起来，薛崑山及其他伙犯在与国营贸易公司合营期间和钻进中国皮毛公司、中国畜产公司之后，先后直接盗窃国家财产人民币四十余亿元，仅薛犯一人，非法获得财产即达二十三亿余元。至于他利用国家机密，指挥他所投资的商号，扰乱市场，投机操纵，使国家和人民遭受的损失，比这个还要大几倍，现在还没有完全计算清楚。六年来，薛崑山吸了国家和人民的血，养肥了他自己，使他从一个只有二百匹布资金的普通商人，变成了一个投资在十九家商号的大资本家。这就是薛崑山向国家和人民欠下的血债，今天，全国人民有权利向他要回这些血债。
    薛崑山是资产阶级向国营贸易机关和一切国营企业举行猖狂进攻的一个最凶恶的典型。他利用了中央贸易部、中国畜产公司、中国皮毛公司的领导同志在政治上麻痹和对资产阶级的进攻缺乏警惕性的错误，钻进了国营贸易企业，进行了严重的破坏活动，使国家和人民受到了重大的损失。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始以后，薛犯曾召集他的爪牙开会布置抵赖。当我们根据已经掌握了的材料，让他坦白，但他始终拒绝坦白，反而随身带着四亿八千万元银行支票，准备逃跑，这证明他丝毫没有悔过之意，决心与人民为敌到底。根据薛崑山以上的犯罪事实，我们要求最高人民法院给以最严厉的制裁。
