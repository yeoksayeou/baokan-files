    Xinjiang Successfully Drills Artesian Well
    One Well Can Irrigate Fifteen Mu of Land Per Day
    The Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau has successfully drilled an artesian well on a trial basis in Hami County. The first successfully drilled artesian well is 25.6 meters deep, with a well diameter of 15 centimeters, and produces 77 tons of water per day, which can irrigate 15 mu of land. This success has opened up a new path for water conservancy in Xinjiang Province. This is a historically significant beginning for the planned and large-scale development and utilization of groundwater for irrigation by the people of Xinjiang.
    Without artificial irrigation, there would be no agriculture in Xinjiang Province, but the amount of usable water sources in the province is not large. Farmers in Xinjiang Province mostly use snowmelt from high mountains to irrigate their fields, and the water seeps into the ground a short distance from the mountains. Only the Turpan Basin in the province uses groundwater for irrigation; the method of use is to dig underground canals (i.e., karez wells) to allow the groundwater to flow to lower-lying areas, where it flows out of the underground canals to irrigate the fields. The construction of karez wells is a huge project and needs to be repaired every year. Moreover, it is limited by the terrain, and karez wells cannot be universally dug throughout the province. Can Xinjiang drill artesian wells? For many years, no one has answered this question for the people of Xinjiang.
    In order to develop agriculture in Xinjiang Province, the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau established an artificial well-drilling team last year, and tried to drill an artesian well in Hami County. After more than a month of hard work by the team, they finally drilled the first artesian well in Xinjiang Province. The principle of an artesian well is the same as that of tap water: in areas with higher terrain, the groundwater level is higher than the ground level in areas with lower terrain, but this groundwater does not flow out of the ground in areas with lower terrain, but follows the terrain down, always remaining below the ground. Therefore, when drilling a well in a low-lying area, reaching the groundwater layer, the groundwater can flow out of the ground continuously due to the water level pressure from the higher groundwater. Drilling an artesian well is much more economical than drawing water with a waterwheel from an ordinary well. There are many places in Xinjiang Province where artesian wells can be drilled. The success of drilling an artesian well in Hami is of great significance for the development of agriculture in Xinjiang Province.

### 新疆试凿自流井成功  一个井每天可灌地十五亩

    新疆试凿自流井成功  
    一个井每天可灌地十五亩
    新疆省人民政府水利局在哈密县境试凿自流井已获成功。试凿成功的第一个自流井深二十五点六公尺，井径十五公分，每天出水七十七吨，可灌地十五亩。这个成功给新疆省的水利事业开辟了一条新的道路，这是新疆人民有计划地、大规模地开发、利用地下水进行灌溉的一个有历史意义的开端。
    新疆省没有人工溉灌就没有农业，但全省可利用的水源却不多。新疆省的农民多利用高山雪水来灌田，离山稍远的地方水就渗到地下去了。全省只有吐鲁番盆地是利用地下水灌田；利用的办法是开地下暗渠（即坎井），使地下水流到地势较低的地方，就流出暗渠来灌田。修坎井工程浩大，年年要修。而且受地形的限制，全省不能普遍开凿坎井。新疆能不能打自流井呢？多年以来没有人为新疆人民解答这个问题。
    为发展新疆省的农业，新疆省人民政府水利局在去年成立了人工凿井工作队，在哈密县境试凿自流井，经该队一个多月的艰苦努力，终于凿成了新疆省的第一个自流井。自流井的原理和自来水一样：地势较高的地方，地下水位比地势低的地面还高，但这种地下水到了地势低的地方也并未流出地面，而是随地势低下去，始终在地面以下。因此在地势低的地方打井，打到地下水层，这样地下水因受高处地下水的水位压力，便可川流不息地流出地面。打自流井比打普通的井用水车汲水经济得多，新疆省可以打自流井的地方不少，哈密开凿自流井成功这件事，对于发展新疆省的农业意义极大。
