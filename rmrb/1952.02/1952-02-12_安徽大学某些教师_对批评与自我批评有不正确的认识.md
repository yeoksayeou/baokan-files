    Some Teachers at Anhui University
    Have an Incorrect Understanding of Criticism and Self-Criticism

    To the Editor:

    The letter "Anhui University Teachers Should Undergo Ideological Remolding Study," published in the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on January 9th, caused great indignation among the criticized professors. They complained to the school leadership and threatened to pack their bags and quit. Wu Qingquan, the head of the Forestry Department, hurriedly summoned Zhao Xingliang, the student who wrote the letter, to interrogate him, demanding that he make a "self-criticism" and even threatened to investigate his family background and his ideological situation. Later, the whole class held a seminar to discuss Zhao Xingliang's letter sentence by sentence. In the end, everyone agreed that: "The spirit of Zhao Xingliang's letter is basically good, and the facts it reflects are not fundamentally wrong."

    This incident clearly shows that the ideological remolding of teachers is absolutely necessary. Is it the proper attitude of a people's teacher to immediately pack up and quit when criticized? Even if the student's suggestions are inappropriate, teachers should not adopt such a wrong attitude.

    安徽大学某些教师
    对批评与自我批评有不正确的认识
    编辑同志：一月九日人民日报“读者来信”栏刊登了“安徽大学教师应该进行思想改造学习”的信。受到批评的教授，看到这封信，都气得不得了。他们向学校领导方面申述，要卷铺盖不干了。森林系系主任吴清泉急忙去叫写信人赵兴梁同学来质问，要他“检讨”，并且声言要调查他的家庭成份和他的思想情况。后来，全班同学开了一个座谈会，把赵兴梁所写的信，逐句讨论。最后大家认为：“赵兴梁同学写的这封信，精神基本上是好的，反映的事实也没有原则的错误。”
    从这一事件，可以清楚地看出教师思想改造是十分必要的。被别人批评了一下，立刻就要卷起铺盖不干，这是人民教师所应有的态度吗？学生提出的意见纵然有不恰当的地方，教师也不应该采取这样错误的态度。    安徽大学学生    何以鸣
