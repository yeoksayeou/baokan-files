    Yellow Play Script Peddling American Bourgeois Thought

    The one-act play "American 'Hero'," written by Zhang Han of the Shanghai Little Theater Troupe, is an extremely absurd and yellow reactionary script. This script describes an American warrant officer stationed in Japan who, posing as an American "hero" who "killed three Koreans with one punch," returns to San Francisco and is actually met with enthusiastic "welcome" and "respect" from "the entire" San Francisco and even the whole of America. When it is discovered that he is a fake "hero," the crowd turns to ridicule and scold this "hero." The word hero is put in quotation marks in the script, meaning that he is not a real hero, but an imposter. How absurd this is! The play shamelessly exaggerates the welcome and respect given to this "hero" by San Francisco and even the whole of America. Although the author points out that the main characters in the play are "ordinary American citizens," not only is there no trace of the American working people's opposition to the war of aggression and demands for peace, but the psychology of these characters is depicted as being almost the same as that of war-mongers. None of them are uninterested in the war of aggression. Obviously, the author's position is very wrong. The author seems to be satirizing the American way of life on the surface, but in reality, he is flaunting his familiarity with the American way of life to the reader and trying his best to publicize it in its entirety, without any criticism. The play also uses many vulgar English dialogues, making it unworthy of reading. The author himself is fascinated by the shameless and ugly life of the American bourgeoisie, and it is not enough that he has become its prisoner, but he also wants to sell this shameless and ugly life and reactionary thoughts to the reader on a large scale, which is a serious mistake. This book is one of the "Mars Literary Series" published by Shanghai Mars Publishing House. In the preface, the editors of the series said that their purpose in publishing this series is "to help workers, peasants, and soldiers absorb new knowledge through literary forms," and they stated that because the previous set of reactionary and yellow literature was completely unsuited (only "unsuited"!) to today, they wanted to publish this series. However, what is the difference between this "American 'Hero'" and the reactionary and yellow books of the past? What is the difference between such "works" and the "works" published in the reactionary American propaganda newspapers and periodicals? Such an absurd book, daring to put up the signboard of "educating" workers, peasants, and soldiers to deceive readers, is this tolerable? The series also includes five short plays under the general title of "Such is the American Way of Life," which focus on depicting the various licentious and shameless lives of the American bourgeoisie: theft, fraud, assassination, prostitution, adultery, and so on. Although the author inserts a "prelude" and "epilogue" before and after each play to criticize these ugly and decadent phenomena, these conceptual criticisms cannot have any effect on the figurative description of the content of the play. These descriptions are objectivist, and there is no sign of the author's hatred for the enemy. The resistance and struggle of the American people are also completely invisible here. The result is that, in essence, it is the same as yellow publications, promoting the decadent life and reactionary thoughts of the American bourgeoisie to readers. We believe that the relevant departments should urge the person in charge of Shanghai Mars Publishing House to seriously examine the work of this publishing house and the "Mars Literary Series."

    贩卖美国资产阶级思想的黄色剧本
    上海小剧社张涵编的独幕剧“美国式的‘英雄’”，是一本内容极端荒谬的黄色反动剧本。这个剧本描写一个驻日的美军准尉冒充“一拳击毙三个朝鲜人”的美国“英雄”回到旧金山，居然受到“整个”旧金山以至全美国的热烈“欢迎”和“尊敬”。及至发见他是冒牌的“英雄”以后，众人即转而奚落、怨骂这个“英雄”。这本书把英雄二字加上了引号，意思是说他并不是真正的英雄，而是冒牌的。这是何等的荒谬！剧中对旧金山以至全美国对这位“英雄”的欢迎和尊崇，极尽无耻渲染的能事。作者虽然指出剧中主要人物是“美国普通市民”，但在剧本里，不仅美国劳动人民的反对侵略战争和要求和平的情绪连影子也找不到，而且这些人物的心理竟都被描写得和战争贩子的差不多，他们没有一个对侵略战争是没有兴趣的。显然，作者的立场是十分错误的。作者表面上好像是讽刺美国生活方式，实际上却是向读者炫耀自己对美国生活方式的熟悉，并用全部篇幅尽力加以宣扬，毫无批判。剧本中还采用了许多英语的庸俗的对话，令人不屑一读。作者自己醉心于美国资产阶级的无耻的丑恶的生活，做了它的俘虏不算数，还要把这种无耻的和丑恶的生活以及反动思想，大肆向读者贩卖，这个错误是严重的。这本书是上海火星出版社出版的“火星文艺丛书”之一。丛书的编者在序言中说，他们出版这套丛书的目的是“为了帮助工农兵大众通过文艺的形式吸收新的知识”，并表示由于过去一套反动的、黄色的文艺已完全不适应（仅仅是“不适应”！）于今天，所以要出版这个丛书。可是，这本“美国式的‘英雄’”和过去那些反动的、黄色的书籍有什么区别呢？这样的“作品”和美国反动宣传的报刊上所载的“作品”有什么区别呢？像这样荒谬的书，居然打起“教育”工农兵的招牌来欺骗读者，这是能够令人容忍的吗？丛书中尚有以“如此美国生活方式”为总题的五个短剧本，内容集中地描写了美国资产阶级的各式各样的荒淫无耻的生活：盗窃、欺诈、暗杀、卖淫、通奸等等。作者虽在每剧前后，插上“序曲”“尾声”各一段，对这些丑恶堕落现象加以批评，但这些概念化的批评对于剧本内容的形象化的描写是不能起什么作用的。那些描写是客观主义的，丝毫看不出作者对敌人的仇恨。美国人民的反抗和斗争在这里也是完全看不见的。其结果就是在实质上和黄色书刊一样，向读者推销美国资产阶级的堕落生活和反动思想。我们认为有关部门应督促上海火星出版社负责人对这个出版社的工作、对“火星文艺丛书”认真加以检查。
