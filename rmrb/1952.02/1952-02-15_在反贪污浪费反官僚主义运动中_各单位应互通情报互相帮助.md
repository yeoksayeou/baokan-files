In the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign,
All Units Should Exchange Information and Help Each Other
Editor:

In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, a unit must exchange information with other relevant units in order to understand and verify relevant materials, so as to satisfactorily clarify the problems. In the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, this experience has been proven to be very effective. However, some units often procrastinate when helping other units, adopting an irresponsible and uncaring attitude, which is wrong. Therefore, I suggest that in this movement, all organs and organizations should promptly help relevant units collect the materials they need so that the other party can deal with the problems in a timely manner. After receiving举报 materials, each unit should also quickly forward materials related to other units to provide the other party with a reference.

### 在反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动中  各单位应互通情报互相帮助

    在反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动中
    各单位应互通情报互相帮助
    编辑同志：在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，一个单位一定要和其他有关单位互通情报，以便了解和证实有关材料，这样才能圆满地搞清问题。在镇压反革命运动中，这种经验已被证明是极有效的。可是有的单位在帮助其他单位时，往往一拖再拖，采取不负责、不关心的态度，这是不对的。所以，我建议，在这次运动中，各机关、团体，应该及时帮助有关单位搜集他们所需要的材料，使对方能及时处理问题。各单位收到检举材料后，也应将有关其他单位的材料，迅速转去，供给对方参考。飞
