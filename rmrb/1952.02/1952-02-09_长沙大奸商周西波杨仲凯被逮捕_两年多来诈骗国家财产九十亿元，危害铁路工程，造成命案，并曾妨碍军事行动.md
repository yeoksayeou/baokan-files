Changsha Big Capitalists Zhou Xibo and Yang Zhongkai Arrested
Scammed 9 Billion Yuan in State Property Over Two Years, Endangering Railway Projects, Causing Fatalities, and Obstructing Military Operations

The big capitalists of Changsha City, Zhou Xibo (manager of Meihuali Hardware Store) and Yang Zhongkai (shareholder of Meihuali Hardware Store), have consistently engaged in speculation, tax evasion, and defrauding state property. They have endangered railway projects, caused major incidents involving loss of life, affected military operations, and used despicable methods to corrupt state cadres. Despite repeated mobilization during the movements against bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets, they have refused to confess. Based on reports from the workers and the Hengyang Railway Administration, and after preliminary investigation, the Changsha Municipal People's Government arrested these two capitalists on January 29 and will severely punish them according to the law.

Zhou, Yang, and their Meihuali Hardware Store have consistently engaged in illegal operations. Before the liberation of Changsha in 1949, various constructions were severely damaged by the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek and Bai Chongxi bandit gangs. After liberation, the People's Government vigorously engaged in restoration work. Zhou, Yang, and others took advantage of the urgent need for hardware materials by various government agencies and troops to engage in speculation and profiteering, selling goods at high prices. However, after selling the goods, they did not continue to stock up but instead withdrew large amounts of cash. In addition, they concealed the shares of the counter-revolutionary Wang Jingzhi (commander of the Kuomintang bandit army, who had fled) in Meihuali Hardware Store, changed the name, and seized it for themselves.

For more than two years, Zhou, Yang, and others have been blinded by greed, committing outrageous acts, and employing various despicable and shameless methods to steal large amounts of state property. According to existing materials, the amount is close to 9 billion yuan. The damage caused to the state in military operations as a result is incalculable. For example, shortly after the liberation of Changsha in 1949, the Hengyang Railway Administration worked day and night to repair the Liujiang Bridge in Pingxiang, Jiangxi, to support the army's advance south. The Hengyang Railway Administration also transported an iron bridge from the Northeast, preparing to erect it. After the bridge piers and other projects were completed, people were sent overnight to Changsha to purchase steel wire for lifting the iron bridge. When the purchasing personnel went to Meihuali Hardware Store to buy it, Zhou and others wickedly sold lead wire, which was three times cheaper than steel wire, as steel wire. The purchasing personnel did not know it was lead wire and transported it back that night to erect the bridge. The lead wire was soft and unable to bear the weight. When the iron bridge was lifted halfway, the lead wire broke, and the iron bridge was smashed, and the bridge pier project was completely destroyed. Even more tragic was that engineer Chen Dai and assistant engineer Liu Jinshan, who participated in the emergency repair project at the construction site, were killed on the spot, worker Ling Huikang was seriously injured, and both legs were broken. In addition, seven other workers were injured and hospitalized in Changsha Xiangya Hospital for more than two months before being discharged. The damage caused by the destruction of this bridge exceeded 3 billion yuan, and the bridge project was delayed for three months, causing a significant impact and loss to the army's advance south and support for the front lines, which is impossible to estimate.

The other crimes committed by the two offenders, such as corrupting working cadres, stealing state property, raising prices to seize exorbitant profits, and evading state taxes, are too numerous to mention. (Guang Jun)

    长沙大奸商周西波杨仲凯被逮捕
    两年多来诈骗国家财产九十亿元，危害铁路工程，造成命案，并曾妨碍军事行动
    长沙市大奸商周西波（美华丽五金号经理）杨仲凯（美华丽五金号股东），一贯投机取巧，偷漏国税，诈骗国家财产，危害铁路工程，造成人命巨案，影响军事行动；并用卑鄙手段，腐蚀国家干部。在反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财运动中，虽经一再动员，仍拒不坦白。长沙市人民政府根据工人群众及衡阳铁路管理局的检举，并经初步调查属实后，已在一月二十九日把这两个奸商逮捕，并将依法予以严惩。周、杨两犯和他们所经营的美华丽五金号，一贯从事不法经营。一九四九年长沙解放前夕，各项建筑受到蒋白匪帮逃窜时的严重破坏，解放后人民政府大力从事恢复工作。周、杨两犯等就趁各机关、部队迫切需要五金器材的时候，投机倒把，高价出售货物。但货物出售后并不继续进货，反把大批现金抽走。另外并隐瞒反革命分子王敬之（国民党匪军师长，已逃亡）在美华丽五金号的股金，并改名换姓，据为己有。两年多来，周、杨两犯等利欲薰心，伤天害理，采用种种卑鄙无耻的恶毒手段盗窃大量国家财产。仅据已有的材料统计，已近九十亿元之巨。至于因此使国家在军事行动上所受的损害，更是无法计算。如一九四九年长沙解放后不久，衡阳铁路管理局为支援大军南进，日夜赶修江西萍乡流江桥。衡阳铁路管理局并由东北运来了一座铁桥，预备架设。当桥墩等工程完成后，就派人连夜赶到长沙购买钢丝，以作起重铁桥之用。当采购人员到美华丽五金号购买时，周犯等竟万恶地以价格低于钢丝三倍的铅丝冒充钢丝出售。采售人员不知道是铅丝，当夜即运回去架桥。铅丝性软，不能胜重，当铁桥起重至半空时，铅丝折断，铁桥被摔断，桥墩工程全部被毁。更惨痛的是在工地参加抢修工程的工程师陈岱，帮工程师刘金山两人当场被砸死，工人凌汇康受重伤，两条腿被打断，另外还有七个工人受伤，在长沙湘雅医院治了两个多月才出院。这次桥梁被毁，所受损失约三十亿元以上；并使桥梁工程延迟了三个月，使大军南下和支援前线工作所受的重大影响和损失更是无法估计的。两犯的其他罪行，如腐蚀工作干部、盗窃国家财产、高抬价格攫取暴利、偷漏国税等，更不胜例举。  （光军）
