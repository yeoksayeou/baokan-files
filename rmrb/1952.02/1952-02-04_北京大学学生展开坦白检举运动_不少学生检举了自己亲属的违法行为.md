    Peking University Students Launch Confession and Denunciation Movement
    Many Students Denounce Illegal Acts of Their Relatives
    Editor: In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the students of Peking University have ideologically taken a step forward, recognizing the harm of bourgeois ideology to the people's cause and strengthening the concept of cherishing the people's property, bravely confessing their own and denouncing others' acts of corruption and waste.
    At the beginning of the movement, many students were concerned about denouncing corruption. However, as the movement unfolded, the students' understanding of this movement gradually improved, and their concerns gradually dispelled. Hu Xiangda, a second-year student in the Chinese Department, remembered at the beginning of the movement that his family had two sets of books, one of which was a fake account specifically for dealing with tax collectors. He wanted to persuade his father to confess, but he was afraid that his father would say he was "ungrateful," so he kept it to himself. Later, when he remembered the criticism in "China Youth" magazine of Zheng Huiren for sheltering a landlord family, he suddenly understood and immediately reported his father to the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce's Savings Inspection Committee on the one hand, and mobilized his father to confess on the other. As of January 20, Peking University had reported 193 cases, 40 percent of which were denunciations of their own family members.

### 北京大学学生展开坦白检举运动  不少学生检举了自己亲属的违法行为

    北京大学学生展开坦白检举运动  
    不少学生检举了自己亲属的违法行为
    编辑同志：在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，北京大学的学生们都在思想上提高了一步，认清了资产阶级思想对人民事业的危害性，加强了爱护人民财产的观念，勇敢地坦白自己和检举别人的贪污浪费行为。
    在运动开始时，很多同学对检举贪污是有顾虑的。但随着运动的展开，同学们对这一次运动的认识渐渐提高，顾虑也逐渐打消。中文系二年级同学胡祥达在运动开始时，想起他的家里有两本账簿，其中一本是专门对付收税人员的假账。他想动员他的父亲坦白，但是怕他的父亲说他“忘恩负义”，因此他把这事放在心里没有说。后来他记起“中国青年”杂志上批评郑辉人包庇地主家庭一事时，立刻恍然大悟，就一方面向天津工商业联合会节约检查委员会检举他的父亲，另一方面动员他的父亲坦白。到一月二十日止，北京大学检举的案件达一百九十三件，其中百分之四十是检举自己家属的。
