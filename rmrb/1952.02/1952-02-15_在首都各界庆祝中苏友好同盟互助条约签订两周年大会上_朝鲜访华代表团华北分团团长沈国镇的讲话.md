Dear Representatives, Leaders, and Comrades:

　　I am very honored and happy to be in Beijing, the capital of the great People's Republic of China, as a member of the Korean People's Goodwill Delegation to China, to celebrate the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship Alliance, and mutual Assistance, which is of epoch-making significance in the political life of peace-loving people all over the world.

　　The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, signed between the Soviet Union led by the great Marshal Stalin and China led by the great Chairman Mao Zedong, has given a new heavy blow to the imperialists and war-mongers, and given confidence in victory to the peace-loving people who constitute the vast majority of the world's population.

　　In the past two years, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has played a tremendous role in safeguarding world peace and security. This fully demonstrates that the friendship and unity between the two largest countries in the world, China and the Soviet Union, cannot be undermined by any imperialists and war-mongers. On the contrary, it will lead to a more ignominious failure of the imperialists.

　　The close unity of the two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, with 700 million people under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China, shows that the people of the world no longer want to live in the old way, but are willing to move towards a truly happy communist society without exploitation and oppression.

　　Today, the revolutionary friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is becoming more and more consolidated. This friendship is an invincible and powerful force that cannot be destroyed by any force.

　　Today, American imperialism is frantically rearming Japan, expanding its war of aggression against Korea, and attempting to continue its occupation of Taiwan. However, this conspiracy of American imperialism will be completely bankrupted under the heavy blows of the Chinese, Korean, and other Asian peoples, and peace-loving people all over the world.

　　The existence of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance gives warm support and solidarity to the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union. In particular, the Korean people, who have received great assistance from the great Chinese people in resisting American aggression and aiding Korea, have strengthened their confidence in the final victory of the Fatherland Liberation War, and strengthened their fighting unity and firm fighting will.

　　There is no doubt that today, with the growing consolidation of the iron-like friendship between the great China and the Soviet Union, the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union has become unprecedentedly powerful. If the war-mongers dare to risk provoking a new war, then the result will be the end of the war with the final death of imperialism.

　　If today the American imperialist aggressor troops do not truly abandon their plans of aggression against Korea and Taiwan, and do not stop provoking new wars, but continue to obstruct the ongoing Korean armistice negotiations, then the people of Korea and China, standing at the forefront of the struggle to defend peace in Asia and the world, will not relax for a moment in their heavy blows against the American imperialist aggressors and their accomplices.

　　The new war instigators headed by American imperialism threaten our peace and democracy camp with aggressive groups such as the "North Atlantic Treaty" and the forthcoming "Pacific Alliance," but the peace-loving people of the world will never be intimidated. We will never be intimidated by the fact that American imperialism manipulates its aggressive tool, the "United Nations" voting machine, to intimidate the good people of the world.

　　The vast majority of peace-loving people all over the world are standing in the peace and democracy camp with the unbreakable friendship and alliance between the great China and the Soviet Union at its core, and are fighting resolutely. Let us hold high the banner of victory and advance bravely to defend the independence, democracy, and freedom of our motherland, and to defend world peace and security!

    在首都各界庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年大会上
    朝鲜访华代表团华北分团团长沈国镇的讲话亲爱的各位代表、各位首长、各位同志们：
    我能在伟大的中华人民共和国首都——北京，庆祝全世界和平人民政治生活上具有划时代的巨大意义的中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年，做为朝鲜人民访华代表团的一员，我感到非常光荣，非常高兴。
    伟大的斯大林大元帅所领导的苏联，和伟大的毛泽东主席所领导的中国之间签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约，给予帝国主义者和战争贩子们以新的沉重打击，给予占全世界人口绝大多数的爱好和平人民以胜利的信心。
    过去两年间，中苏两大国签订的友好同盟互助条约，在保卫世界和平与安全方面起了莫大的作用。这充分说明了：世界上最大的中苏两国的友好团结，不但是任何帝国主义者和战争贩子们所不能破坏的，相反，却会使帝国主义者遭到更可耻的失败。
    在苏联共产党和中国共产党领导下的拥有七万万人民的中苏两大国的紧密团结，显示了全世界人民不愿再以旧的方式生存下去，而愿意走向无剥削无压迫的真正幸福的共产主义社会。
    今天，中苏两国人民的革命友谊愈益巩固起来了。这个友谊是任何力量所不能摧毁的天下无敌的强大力量。
    今天，美帝国主义正在疯狂地重新武装日本，扩大侵略朝鲜战争，企图继续占领台湾。但是，美帝国主义的这种阴谋计划，将在中国、朝鲜及其他亚洲各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的沉重打击下，完全破产。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的存在，给予以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营热烈的支持和声援，特别是受到伟大的中国人民抗美援朝莫大援助的朝鲜人民，更加加强了对祖国解放战争最后胜利的信心，加强了战斗的团结和坚决的斗争意志。
    毫无疑问，伟大的中苏两国钢铁般的友谊日益巩固的今天，以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营空前强大起来了。如果战争贩子们敢于冒险挑拨新的战争，那么，其结果一定会以帝国主义的最后死亡来结束战争。
    如果今天美帝国主义侵略军不真正放弃对朝鲜、台湾的侵略计划，不中止挑拨新战争的行为，而仍然继续阻挠正在进行着的朝鲜停战谈判，那么，站在保卫亚洲和平及世界和平斗争最前线的朝中两国人民，就会片刻也不放松对美帝国主义侵略者及其帮凶的沉重打击。
    以美帝国主义为首的新战争挑拨者们，以“北大西洋公约”等侵略集团，和将要订立“太平洋同盟”等谰调来威胁我们和平民主阵营，但是全世界爱好和平的人民绝不会被吓倒的。美帝国主义操纵其侵略工具——“联合国”表决机器，来威吓全世界善良的人民，这我们也绝不会被吓倒的。
    全世界绝大多数的爱好和平人民，都站在以伟大的中苏两国牢不可破的友好同盟为核心的和平民主阵营中坚决地斗争着。我们高举起胜利的旗帜，为保卫祖国的独立、民主、自由，为保卫世界和平与安全，勇敢地前进吧！
