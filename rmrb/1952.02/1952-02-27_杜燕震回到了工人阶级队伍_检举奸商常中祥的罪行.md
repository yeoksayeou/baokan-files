    Du Yanzhen Returns to the Ranks of the Working Class
    To Expose the Crimes of the Unscrupulous Merchant Chang Zhongxiang
    To the Editors: I am a carpenter at the Beijing Private Da Zhong Construction Factory. The manager of Da Zhong, Chang Zhongxiang, is an unscrupulous merchant who consistently cuts corners and uses inferior materials in contracted projects to reap exorbitant profits. This unscrupulous merchant considered me his confidant and frequently used petty favors to win me over. As a result, I lost my class standpoint and acted according to the unscrupulous merchant's will. After the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, the inspection team comrades mobilized me to expose the unscrupulous merchant. Instead, I shielded him. The inspection team comrades, with the spirit of treating illness to save the patient, gave me much enlightenment and education. I was in ideological conflict, frowning and pacing during the day, sighing and unable to sleep at night. I thought: should I expose or shield him? Stand in the ranks of the working class or be his lackey? I also considered the issue of my profession after the exposure and my own past mistakes. The inspection team comrades noticed that I was behaving abnormally and proactively explained the government's policies to me. They gave me support, and I broke through my ideological concerns and exposed the unscrupulous merchant's crimes in one breath. In the autumn of the year before last, our factory was constructing a building for the Central Ministry of Health. The unscrupulous merchant instructed me to pass off substandard cement as good cement, resulting in cracks in the walls and leaks in the roof of the newly built building, which had to be repaired four or five times. The unscrupulous merchant almost always overbought materials when purchasing for public projects and then ordered the laborers to steal the excess materials back to the factory. I must resolutely stand in the ranks of the working class and absolutely not let these thieves who steal state wealth escape this hurdle.

    杜燕震回到了工人阶级队伍
    检举奸商常中祥的罪行
    编辑同志：我是北京私营大中营造厂的木工。大中的经理常中祥是个奸商，他一贯在所包工程中偷工减料，牟取暴利。奸商认为我是他的心腹，经常用小恩小惠收买我。我因此失掉了阶级立场，竟依照奸商的意志去干事情。反贪污、反行贿运动开始后，检查组同志动员我检举奸商。我反而包庇他。检查组同志抱着治病救人的精神，给我许多启发和教育。我思想斗争起来了，白天愁眉不展，踱来踱去，晚上唉声叹气，睡不着觉。我想：我到底检举还是包庇？站到工人阶级队伍中来，还是做他的狗腿子？我又考虑到检举后的职业问题和以前自己的错误。检查组同志看见我起居失常，就主动地向我解释政府的政策。他们给我撑腰，我打破了思想顾虑，一口气检举了奸商的罪行。前年秋天，我厂给中央卫生部修筑楼房，奸商叫我把劣质洋灰冒充好洋灰，结果使新建的楼房，墙裂顶漏，修补了四五次。奸商代公家买材料，差不多每次都多买，然后叫小工把多余的材料偷回到厂里。我要坚决站到工人阶级队伍中来，绝对不能让这些盗窃国家财富的贼逃过这一关。
