Xinhua News Agency, February 14th: The people from all walks of life in the capital grandly held a celebration meeting at 7:30 PM on the 14th to commemorate the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. Present at the meeting were Liu Shaoqi, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Vice Presidents Wu Yuzhang, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Li Jishen, Huang Yanpei, as well as directors and staff of the association in Beijing; Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government, and heads of various ministries, commissions, departments, bureaus, and banks; leading figures from various democratic parties and people's organizations, and figures from the cultural circles. Also attending this grand event were Soviet Ambassador to China Roschin and embassy staff, Soviet experts in Beijing, the North China Sub-group of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, and the North China Sub-group of the Korean People's Delegation to China, totaling over a thousand people.

Foreign guests invited to attend the meeting included Czechoslovak Ambassador Weiskopf, Head of the Diplomatic Mission of the German Democratic Republic Koenig, Hungarian Ambassador Saffronko, Bulgarian Ambassador Petkov, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Polish Embassy Doding, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Zhou Liang, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Korean Embassy Choi Young, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Mongolian Embassy Darhazhab, and Counselor of the Romanian Embassy Chirad.

As the meeting began, the band played the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union, and Liu Shaoqi, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered the opening address. He said: "Over the past two years, people have seen the significant role this Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which has great historical significance, has played in promoting the construction of New China and safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world. It can be asserted that in the future, it will have a more profound and beneficial impact on the people of China and the Soviet Union and the people of the whole world." Then, after listing a series of shameless conspiracies of American imperialism recently, President Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "We can see that American imperialism never forgets its attempts to invade our People's Republic of China. However, in the face of the Chinese people who have already stood up, coupled with the consolidation and development of the great Sino-Soviet friendship alliance, any aggressive conspiracy of the enemy will surely be thoroughly crushed."

Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government spoke. He first expressed his deep gratitude on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government to the Soviet people and the Soviet government for the brotherly assistance they have given to our country's construction cause over the past two years. After summarizing the shameless crimes of American imperialism over the past two years, Premier Zhou said: The central link in this series of aggressive actions by American imperialism is to revive Japanese militarism, rearm Japan, with the aim of attempting to create a military threat to the People's Republic of China and antagonize the Soviet Union, thereby preparing for a new and larger-scale war of aggression in the Far East to threaten the security of the entire Asia. The Chinese people, who once defeated the Japanese aggressors, overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and are now defeating American imperialism in Korea, are absolutely not afraid of this threat and have full confidence in crushing the conspiracy of aggression by American imperialism and its vassal states. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is a "strong guarantee for peace and security in the Far East," and is now more clearly manifested.

Ambassador Roschin delivered a speech saying: Today, the two great countries in the world—the people of the Soviet Union and China—celebrate a significant event. On this day, they are eternally united by the bonds of friendship and alliance, transforming this friendship and alliance into an unparalleled force for consolidating the cause of world peace. Ambassador Roschin then used concrete facts to illustrate the great achievements made by China and the Soviet Union in economic and cultural construction over the past two years. He said: The past two years have proved that cooperation between the Soviet Union and China in all aspects has developed. The people of the Soviet Union and China have participated in the struggle for peace and against warmongers; the people of the two countries unanimously signed the Stockholm Appeal and unanimously supported the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. The economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China has bankrupted the attempts of the American and British warmongers to strangle the young People's Republic of China through aggression, blockade, and embargo. Ambassador Roschin finally pointed out: The two years since the signing of the treaty have shown the most important international significance of this treaty for the cause of peace. At present, under the complicated international situation, the full significance of the Sino-Soviet treaty is particularly powerfully demonstrated. This treaty is a solid guarantee for peace and security in the Far East and the world.

Shen Guozhen, head of the North China Sub-group of the Korean People's Delegation to China, delivered a speech. He pointed out: The friendly alliance between the people of China and the Soviet Union is an invincible and powerful force. He said: The existence of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance gives enthusiastic support and solidarity to the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and especially strengthens the confidence of the Korean people, who have received great assistance from the great Chinese people's resistance to America and aid to Korea, in the final victory of the fatherland's liberation war, and strengthens the fighting unity and firm fighting will.

Tian Bo, head of the North China Sub-group of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Returning Delegation, said in his speech: We, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, are active supporters and implementers of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. We are not only the defenders of the motherland but also the fighters for maintaining world peace and justice. Last year, on the anniversary of the October Revolution, we collectively joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and were accepted as honorary group members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, which further encouraged our fighting spirit and increased our confidence. We firmly believe that "the unity and cooperation between the two great countries of China and the Soviet Union is invincible."

The meeting proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Finally, the Central Academy of Drama Affiliated Song and Dance Theater and the Amateur Troupe of the Soviet Embassy jointly performed programs.

    【新华社十四日讯】首都各界在十四日下午七时半隆重举行庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年大会。到会的有中苏友好协会总会会长刘少奇，副会长吴玉章、沈钧儒、郭沫若、李济深、黄炎培及该会在京理事、干事，中央人民政府朱德副主席、周恩来总理及各院、委、部、会、署、行首长，各民主党派和各人民团体负责人及文化界人士。出席这一盛会的还有苏联驻我国特命全权大使罗申及大使馆人员、在京苏联专家，中国人民志愿军归国代表团华北分团和朝鲜人民访华代表团华北分团，共计一千余人。
    应邀参加大会的外宾有捷克斯洛伐克大使魏斯柯普夫、德意志民主共和国外交使团团长柯尼希、匈牙利大使夏法朗柯、保加利亚大使彼得科夫、波兰大使馆临时代办道定、越南民主共和国代表团临时代办周亮、朝鲜大使馆临时代办崔英、蒙古大使馆临时代办达尔哈热布、罗马尼亚大使馆参赞席拉德。
    大会开始，乐队高奏中苏两国国歌，中苏友好协会刘少奇会长致开会词。他说：“两年来，人们都会看到这个具有伟大历史意义的中苏友好同盟互助条约对于促进新中国的建设，对于保卫远东与世界的和平已经发生了何等重大的作用。可以断言，在今后，它对中苏两国人民和全世界人民将要发生更加深远和有利的影响。”接着，刘少奇会长在列举最近美帝国主义一系列的无耻的阴谋活动后指出：“我们可以看见美帝国主义是念念不忘侵略我们中华人民共和国的。但是，在已经站起来了的中国人民前面，加上伟大的中苏友好同盟的巩固与发展，敌人的任何侵略阴谋一定会彻底地被粉碎的。”
    中央人民政府政务院周恩来总理讲话。他首先代表中国人民和中国政府对苏联人民和苏联政府两年多以来在我国建设事业中所给予的兄弟般的援助，表示深切的感谢。周总理在综述美帝国主义两年来的无耻罪行后说：美帝国主义这一系列侵略行动的中心环节就是复活日本军国主义，重新武装日本，其目的就在于企图造成对中华人民共和国的军事威胁，并敌视苏联，从而准备新的更大规模的远东侵略战争，以威胁整个亚洲的安全。曾经战胜了日本侵略者，推翻了国民党反动统治，现在又在朝鲜击败了美帝国主义的中国人民是绝不怕这种威胁的，并且有充分信心来粉碎美帝国主义及其仆从国家这种侵略的阴谋。中苏友好同盟互助条约是“远东和平与安全的坚强保障”，现在是更加明显地表现出来了。
    罗申大使致词说：今天，世界上两大国家——苏联和中国人民庆祝具有重大意义的事件，在这一天，他们以友好与同盟的纽带永恒地结合起来，把这种友好与同盟化为巩固全世界和平事业的无可匹敌的力量。罗申大使接着用具体事实说明中苏两国两年来在经济和文化建设方面所获得的伟大成就。他说：过去两年证明：苏中两国之间在各方面的合作获得了发展。苏中两国人民参加了争取和平、反对战争贩子的斗争；两国人民一致地在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名；并一致拥护缔结五强和平公约。苏联和中华人民共和国在经济上的合作，使美、英战争贩子们用侵略、封锁及禁运等手段来绞杀年轻的中华人民共和国的企图破产了。罗申大使最后指出：订约以来的两年，显示了这个条约对于和平事业的最重要的国际意义。目前，在复杂的国际情势之下，苏中条约的全部意义特别有力地表现出来了，这个条约是远东和全世界的和平与安全的坚固的保障。朝鲜人民访华代表团华北分团团长沈国镇致词。他指出：中苏两国人民的友好同盟，是天下无敌的强大力量。他说：中苏友好同盟互助条约的存在，给予以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营以热烈支持和声援，特别是受到伟大的中国人民抗美援朝的莫大援助的朝鲜人民，更加加强对祖国解放战争最后胜利的信心，加强战斗的团结和坚决的斗争意志。
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团华北分团团长田波在讲话中说：我们中国人民志愿军是中苏友好同盟互助条约的积极拥护者和执行者，我们不仅是祖国人民的保卫者，也是维护世界和平与正义的斗士。去年十月革命节，我们集体加入中苏友好协会，被接受为光荣的中苏友协的团体会员，这就进一步鼓舞了我们的斗志，提高了我们的信心，我们坚信“中苏两大国家的团结合作是天下无敌的”。
    大会在热烈友好的气氛中进行。最后由中央戏剧学院附属歌舞剧院、苏联大使馆业余剧团联合演出节目。
