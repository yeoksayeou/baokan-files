(Xinhua News Agency, February 4th) According to TASS Paris: The United Nations General Assembly plenary session on the 1st discussed the "Accusation Against the Soviets" instigated by the US through the representative of the Kuomintang remnant bandit group - falsely accusing the Soviet Union of "not fulfilling" the Sino-Soviet Treaty signed in 1945. As in the Political Committee, the United States suffered a crushing political and moral defeat.

During the plenary session discussions, apart from the United States representative, the initiator of this provocative defamation case, and Kuomintang elements speaking in support of it, not a single representative from the US-UK bloc countries spoke in support.

Soviet representative Malik spoke at the meeting, summarizing the results of the Political Committee's discussion of the defamation case. He pointed out that in the Political Committee, the Soviet delegation and other national delegations had, based on documentary material, clearly exposed and proven the bankruptcy of the defamation case. The Kuomintang's provocative attempt to defame the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China had failed, and the majority of United Nations member states did not support the slanderers on this issue.

Malik vehemently condemned the provocative statement made by the US representative, saying that the United States directly linked the discussion of this defamation case to its military plans and preparations against the People's Republic of China and the people of Asia in Southeast Asia. The US representative, on behalf of the US government, stated that "any communist aggression" occurring in Southeast Asia would be taken seriously by the US government. The provocative nature of this statement by the US representative is obvious. The US government is attempting to shift responsibility onto those who are not responsible, attempting to conceal its preparations to launch an invasion of southern China using Kuomintang mercenary forces entrenched on the Burmese border. News reports have already indicated that these Kuomintang troops have launched hostile actions in Burmese territory bordering the People's Republic of China. On January 29th, the US "New York Times" reported that the Burmese government announced on the evening of January 29th that Burmese troops were fighting large Kuomintang forces in the mountainous areas of northern Burma. The Burmese government's statement condemned the Kuomintang troops for invading Burmese territory. It appears that hostile actions have already begun in Burmese territory, and Kuomintang and US military provocations have begun. These actions were launched by Kuomintang troops who received supplies from US military arsenals and were effectively commanded by US generals and officers. This military provocation in Burmese territory could be exploited at any time to expand US aggression against China. The full responsibility for this action should be borne entirely by the US government.

Malik emphasized that the US's instigation of its Kuomintang lackeys to make false accusations against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China was precisely to divert the attention of the United Nations and world opinion from the US's expansion of aggression in the Far East. Malik pointed out that the Kuomintang lackeys do not represent China; they are merely puppets of the United States and have no right to raise any issues in various United Nations bodies. The discussion of this defamation case fully exposed its provocative and aggressive nature. The Soviet delegation once again firmly advocated ceasing the review of this defamation case and firmly advocated rejecting this false accusation.

Representatives from Czechoslovakia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Poland spoke in support of the Soviet delegation's demands.

In the final vote at the plenary session, although the United States mustered 26 votes to barely pass the Kuomintang's defamation case, it could not conceal its serious political and moral defeat. The majority of representatives refused to support this absurd defamation case by the United States and the Kuomintang. Nine delegations (Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Burma, Indonesia, India, and Israel) voted against it. Twenty-four delegations (Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Great Britain, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, France, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, Yemen, and other countries) abstained. Another delegation did not participate in the vote. Thus, among the sixty delegations of the United Nations, a total of thirty-four delegations refused to support the Kuomintang's defamation.

    美国应对缅境国民党残匪的军事挑衅负责
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：联合国大会全体会议一日讨论美国指使国民党残匪集团代表提出的“控苏案”——诬告苏联“没有履行”一九四五年签订的中苏条约。和在政治委员会中一样，美国在政治上和道义上遭到惨重的失败。
    在全体会议讨论过程中，除了这个挑衅性的诽谤案的提出者美国代表和国民党分子发言支持这个诽谤案以外，美英集团国家中竟没有一个代表发言支持这个诽谤案。
    苏联代表马立克在会上发言，总结了政治委员会讨论这个诽谤案的结果。他指出：在政治委员会中，苏联代表团和其他一些国家代表团已经根据文件性的材料，明明白白地揭露并证明了这个诽谤案的破产。国民党对苏联和中华人民共和国的诽谤案的挑衅企图遭到失败，大多数联合国会员国在这个问题上没有支持诽谤者。
    马立克痛斥美国代表的挑衅性声明说：美国把这个诽谤案的讨论与它在东南亚对付中华人民共和国和亚洲人民的军事计划和准备直接联系起来。美国代表代表美国政府说，在东南亚发生的“任何共产党侵略”，都会受到美国政府的重视。美国代表这种声明的挑衅性质是显而易见的。美国政府妄想把责任转嫁到不应负责的人的身上，妄想把它利用盘据在缅甸边境的国民党雇佣军队准备在中国南方发动侵略的迹象掩饰起来。报上已有消息表明，这些国民党军队已经在与中华人民共和国边界毗连的缅甸境内展开了敌对行动。一月二十九日美国“纽约时报”报道，缅甸政府一月二十九日晚间宣布：缅甸军队正在缅甸北部边境山区和国民党大股部队作战。缅甸政府的声明斥责国民党军队侵犯缅甸领土。这样看来，敌对行动已经在缅甸境内开始了，国民党和美国的军事挑衅行动已经开始了。这种行动是从美国军队的军械供应库中领取供应品、并且实际上受美国将领和军官指挥的国民党军队所发动的。在缅甸境内的这种军事挑衅行动，随时都有可能被利用来扩大美国对中国的侵略。这种行动的全部责任完全应该由美国政府担负。
    马立克强调说：美国指使它的国民党走狗提出中伤苏联和中华人民共和国的诬告，正是为了要转移联合国和世界舆论对美国在远东扩大侵略的注意。马立克指出：国民党走狗并不代表中国，它只是美国的傀儡，它没有任何权利在联合国各种机构中提出任何问题。对这个诽谤案的讨论，充分暴露了这个诽谤案的挑衅性和侵略性。苏联代表团再一次坚决主张停止审议这个诽谤案，并且坚决主张拒绝这个诬告案。
    捷克斯洛伐克、乌克兰、白俄罗斯和波兰代表发言支持苏联代表团的要求。
    在全体会议最后进行表决时，美国虽然纠集到二十六票勉强通过国民党诽谤案，但却无法掩饰它在政治上和道义上的严重失败。大多数代表在表决中拒绝支持美国和国民党的这个荒谬的诽谤案。九个代表团（苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、缅甸、印尼、印度和以色列）投票反对。二十四个代表团（阿富汗、阿根廷、澳大利亚、英国、比利时、丹麦、瑞典、挪威、法国、埃及、伊朗、巴基斯坦、叙利亚、也门和其他国家）弃权。另有一个代表团不参加投票。这样，在联合国六十个代表团中就共有三十四个代表团拒绝支持国民党的诽谤。
