    The Tianjin Daily and Tianjin Progressive Daily's Publication of Photos of Unscrupulous Merchants Shows a Loss of Stance
    In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, it is entirely necessary to use photographs to report the great power and momentum of this struggle. However, this must show the scenes of the people bravely reporting and enthusiastically struggling, and it must show the trembling and ugly state of those corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants who refuse to confess in the face of the power of the masses. Some newspapers have violated this principle. For example, the Tianjin Daily on January 26th, page two, and the Tianjin Progressive Daily on page one, published individual half-length photos of 31 unscrupulous merchants, including Yang Jian'an, who were arrested by the People's Government for refusing to confess. These photos were objectively arranged together, and the images of many of the unscrupulous merchants were still calm and composed, without showing the ugly faces of these national vermin under the pressure of the masses. This is an erroneous reporting method that does not distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. This should be corrected.

    天津日报和天津进步日报刊登奸商照片有失立场
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，用照片来报道这个斗争的伟大力量和声势是完全必要的。但这必须是表现人民群众勇敢检举和热烈斗争的场面，必须是表现那些拒不坦白的贪污分子和奸商在群众力量面前的战粟丑态。有些报纸却违背了这一原则。例如一月二十六日的天津日报二版和天津进步日报一版，刊登了被人民政府逮捕的拒不坦白的奸商杨健庵等三十一人的单人半身照片，这些照片被客观地排列在一起，照片中的许多奸商的形象，依然是神情自若、态度从容的，丝毫没有把这些国家蟊贼在人民群众压力下的丑恶嘴脸表现出来。这是一种敌我不分的错误的报道方法。这是应该加以纠正的。
