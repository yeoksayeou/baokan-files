    China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, Shanxi District Committee
    Inspection of the Embezzlement Case of Jin Shouwu
    Comrade Editor: On November 28th of last year, the People's Daily published reader Ding Er's exposure of the embezzlement incident involving Jin Shouwu, the Labor Protection Section Chief of the Shanxi District Committee of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union. We now report the results of our inspection as follows:
    The occurrence of Jin Shouwu's embezzlement incident is inseparable from the serious bureaucratic style of leadership on the part of our District Committee. We lacked a strict financial system, which opened the door for embezzlers. In normal times, we lacked ideological leadership for Jin Shouwu and did not pay attention to correcting his bad work style and bad habits. After his embezzlement problem was discovered, we did not handle it promptly. These are all things we should examine. In the future, we should establish a strict working system, strengthen political education for cadres, regularly conduct in-depth inspections of work, and mobilize the masses to conduct extensive supervision in order to completely eliminate corruption.
    In order to safeguard national interests and educate cadres, we conducted research based on his self-criticism and the facts of his mistakes. After obtaining the consent of the higher-level trade union, we decided to give him the punishment of dismissal from his post.
    China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, Shanxi District Committee

    中国邮电工会山西区委员会
    对靳守武贪污案件的检查
    编辑同志：去年十一月二十八日，人民日报刊载了读者丁二揭发邮电工会山西区委员会劳保科长靳守武的贪污事件。我们现在把检查结果报告如下：
    靳守武贪污事件的发生，是和我们区委员会领导方面的严重的官僚主义分不开的。我们缺乏严密的财务制度，因而给贪污分子开了方便之门。我们在平时对靳守武缺乏思想领导，也没有注意纠正他的坏作风、坏习惯。当他的贪污问题被发现后，我们没有及时处理。这些都是我们应该检讨的。今后我们应建立严密的工作制度，加强对干部的政治教育，经常深入检查工作，并发动群众进行广泛的监督，以彻底消灭贪污现象。
    为了维护国家利益和教育干部，我们根据他的检讨和错误事实，进行了研究。我们在取得上级工会的同意后，决议给他以撤职的处分。
    中国邮电工会山西区委员会
