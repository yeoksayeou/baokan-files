    [This Newspaper's Report] The Chairman of the China People's Relief Association, Soong Ching Ling, received a letter from the Japan National Relief Association requesting support for their struggle to demand the release of Iida Shichizo and seven other Japanese patriots. After receiving the letter, the China People's Relief Association replied to the Japan National Relief Association on January 24th, expressing its support and firmly protesting this illegal measure by the Japanese reactionary authorities. The full text of the original letter is as follows: To the Japan National Relief Association and forwarded to the families of Iida Shichizo and other arrested patriots:
    We are extremely indignant to hear that Iida Shichizo and six others have been illegally arrested and transferred to military tribunals by the reactionary rulers. This is another shameful conspiracy, instigated by US imperialism, to frame Japanese patriots. It is a sharp satire on the US-made separate "peace treaty" with Japan.
    We express our firm protest against the Japanese reactionary government's barbarous persecution of innocent workers, and extend our deep condolences to you. We will do everything in our power to support your struggle. We firmly believe that with the support of the peace and democracy forces of the world, you will surely achieve final victory!
    We wish you success!
    China People's Relief Association
    January 24th
    Note: Iida Shichizo is a member of the Japanese Communist Party and the chairman of the Mitaka branch of the Japan National Railway Workers' Union. In July 1949, the Japanese reactionary authorities fabricated the "Mitaka Incident" and used it as a pretext to arrest him. The Japanese reactionary prosecutors shamelessly demanded the death penalty; however, due to the firm opposition and fierce struggle of the broad masses of the Japanese people, Iida Shichizo was acquitted and released in August 1950. On December 2, 1951, Iida Shichizo and six other Japanese communists were illegally arrested by the police while dining at the home of lumber merchant Kazunori Yasuda. When the police made the arrests, they only used an arrest warrant with someone else's name on it and only for one person. After their arrest, Iida Shichizo and others were detained in police stations for as long as eighteen days, and on the 19th, they were handed over to the US occupation authorities, after which their whereabouts became unknown. Now, Iida Shichizo's wife, Hideko Iida, and the families of other detainees have launched a signature campaign in conjunction with the Japan National Relief Association, launching a struggle to demand the release of Iida Shichizo and the other seven.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo Dispatch: The Provisional Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on December 8th of last year, protesting against the Yoshida government's unreasonable arrest of seven JCP activists, including Iida Shichizo, on December 2, 1951.
    The statement first denounced the police for illegally arresting Iida Shichizo and the other seven at the home of lumber merchant Yasuda. The statement pointed out that if the police were allowed to arbitrarily search homes and arrest and detain people who were not related to the arrest warrants they carried without any legitimate reason, then the police would eventually disregard the law and arrest people and search homes without cause. This not only concerns our party – a legal political party – and its members and those who sympathize with our party, but also the basic human rights of the people throughout Japan.
    The statement went on to say that in 1951, the Yoshida government searched tens of thousands of homes and arrested thousands of people under the pretext of "anti-American activities," "struggles for peace," and "anti-occupation behavior." Now, the Yoshida government is desperately trying to use the Iida Shichizo "case" to expand the scope of arrests. Because of this case, Mr. Yasuda and his two sons were also arrested, and many other homes were searched. The bourgeois newspapers are systematically conducting a propaganda campaign, clamoring that "the Communist Party is stepping up the creation of riots." When the National Public Prosecutors Conference was held in Tokyo, this "case" became the main topic of discussion. It is obvious that the authorities are trying to fabricate a major case to frame the communists.
    The Yoshida government intends to legally establish this reign of terror by enacting the Group Regulation Act (the main purpose of which is to outlaw the Communist Party), laws restricting large-scale demonstrations, bans on general strikes, and press and publication laws. The Yoshida government intends to make wholesale deletions and revisions to the Criminal Procedure Law. The Yoshida government also intends to enact many other laws to suppress the people's movement. The Japanese government is accustomed to actually enforcing these laws before they are formally enacted, thereby creating a fait accompli. This incident of unreasonably arresting our party's activists shows that the draft anti-people laws are already being implemented in practice, and the government is creating conditions for these laws.
    The statement concluded: We call on the people of Japan – including the Japanese laboring people who are struggling to prevent the Diet from passing these draft laws – to continue to struggle against this incident of unreasonably arresting seven activists of the Communist Party.

    我国人民救济总会复函日本国民救援会
    声援日本人民要求释放饭田七三等的斗争
    日共临时中央指导部斥责吉田政府的非法逮捕暴行
    【本报讯】中国人民救济总会宋庆龄主席，曾接到日本国民救援会的来信，请求支援他们要求释放饭田七三等七名日本爱国者的斗争。中国人民救济总会接信后，于一月二十四日复函日本国民救援会表示支援，并对日本反动当局的这一非法措施表示坚决抗议。原函全文如下：日本国民救援会并转饭田七三及其他被捕爱国人士家属：
    听到饭田七三及其他六人横遭反动统治者非法逮捕并被移送军事裁判的事，我们感到非常愤怒。这是在美帝国主义的嗾使下有计划地制造的、陷害日本爱国人士的又一可耻阴谋。这是对美制单独对日“和约”的一个尖锐讽刺。
    我们对日本反动政府蛮横残暴迫害无辜工人的行为表示坚决抗议，并对你们致以深切的慰问。我们将尽一切力量支援你们的斗争。我们深信在全世界和平民主力量的支持下，你们一定能够得到最后胜利！
    祝你们成功！
    中国人民救济总会

    按：饭田七三是日本共产党党员、日本国营铁路工人工会三鹰分会主席。一九四九年七月，日本反动当局制造了“三鹰事件”并以此为借口逮捕了他，日本反动检察官曾无耻地要求判处死刑；但由于日本广大人民坚决反对并进行了激烈斗争，饭田七三于一九五○年八月被判无罪释放。一九五一年十二月二日，饭田七三和其他六名日本共产党人，在木料商安田一德家中吃饭时，同被警察非法逮捕。警察逮捕时，仅用了一张写着别人姓名而且是逮捕一个人的拘票。饭田七三等被捕后，被拘禁在警察所中达十八天之久，十九日竟被移交给美军占领当局，以后他们就下落不明。现在，饭田七三的妻子饭田秀子和其他被捕者的家属与日本国民救援会联名发起签名，展开了要求释放饭田七三等七人的斗争。
    【新华社讯】东京迟到消息：日本共产党临时中央指导部在去年十二月八日发表声明，抗议吉田政府在一九五一年十二月二日无理逮捕饭田七三等七个日共的积极分子。
    声明首先斥责警察在木料商安田家里逮捕饭田七三等七人是非法的。声明指出：如果允许警察没有任何正当理由任意搜查住宅并逮捕和拘留与警察所带的逮捕证件没有关系的人，那末警察最后就会目无法律，无故捕人和搜查住宅。这不但关系我党——一个合法政党——及其党员与同情我党的人，而且关系日本全国人民的基本人权。
    声明接着说：吉田政府在一九五一年在“反美活动”、“为和平斗争”和“反占领行为”的罪名下，搜查成万家住宅，逮捕成千的人。现在，吉田政府又竭力利用饭田七三这个“案件”扩大逮捕的范围。由于这个案件，安田先生和他的两个儿子也被逮捕，其他许多人家被搜查。资产阶级报纸正在有计划地进行一种宣传运动，大肆叫嚣“共产党加紧制造暴乱”。当东京举行全国检事会议时，这个“案件”成为主要的讨论题目。显而易见，当局竭力想制造一件陷害共产党人的大案件。
    吉田政府打算合法地建立这种恐怖统治，办法是制订团体等规正法（主要目的是使共产党成为非法）、限制大规模示威的法令、禁止总罢工令和新闻出版法，吉田政府打算对刑事诉讼法横加删改。吉田政府还打算制订其他许多法律来压制民众运动。日本政府惯于在这些法令没有正式制订以前就在实际上加以执行，借以造成既成事实。这种无理逮捕我党积极分子的事件说明：拟订中的反人民的法令实际上已经执行，政府正在为这些法令创造条件。
    声明最后说：我们号召日本全国人民——包括正在为防止国会通过这些拟订中的法令而斗争的日本劳动人民在内——继续进行斗争，反对这次无理逮捕共产党的七个积极分子的事件。
