    We are Determined to Eradicate the Filth of the Bourgeoisie
    Editor: After listening to the live broadcast of the "Beijing Public Trial of Major Embezzlers" on the Central People's Broadcasting Station on February 1st, the students of our school wholeheartedly support the policies of the People's Government. Executing major embezzlers like Xue Kunshan and Song Degui, who refused to confess and resolutely opposed the people, is eliminating a major scourge for the people. Those like Sun Jianguo and Xia Maoru, who sincerely confessed and exposed other embezzlers and profiteers, can have their criminal penalties reduced or exempted by the people, giving them an opportunity to start anew. From this, we have further recognized the glory, correctness, and greatness of the Chinese Communist Party, and the spirit of the People's Government in wholeheartedly serving the people. We love the Party, the People's Government, and our superior system even more. We believe that under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy will surely achieve complete victory. We have the confidence and determination to thoroughly investigate the phenomena of corruption and waste in our school and completely eradicate the filth of the bourgeoisie.

    我们有决心洗清资产阶级的污毒
    编辑同志：二月一日我校同学收听中央人民广播电台转播的“北京公审大贪污犯大会”的实况后，衷心地拥护人民政府的政策。枪毙薛崑山、宋德贵那种拒不坦白、坚决和人民为敌的大贪污犯，就是给人民除了大害。像孙建国、夏茂如等真心坦白，并检举其他贪污分子和奸商，人民可以减轻或免除他们的刑事处分，给以从新作人的机会。从这里，我们更加认识了中国共产党的光荣、正确、伟大，人民政府忠心耿耿为人民办事的精神。我们更加热爱党、热爱人民政府、热爱我们的优越制度。我们相信在共产党和毛主席领导下，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动一定能得到彻底的胜利。我们有信心和决心把我们学校的贪污、浪费现象彻底搞清，把资产阶级的污毒洗刷干净。
