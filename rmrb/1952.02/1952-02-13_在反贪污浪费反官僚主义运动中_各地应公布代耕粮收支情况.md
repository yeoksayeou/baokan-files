    During the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign,
    All Regions Should Publicize the Income and Expenditure of Grain for Substitute Farming
    
    Comrade Editor: Not long ago, at the county people's representative conferences in Wu'an and Feixiang counties, Hebei Province, I heard many representatives request the government to publicize the accounts of income and expenditure of grain for substitute farming. Therefore, I suggest that all regions, during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, publicize the income and expenditure of grain for substitute farming, examine whether the use is reasonable, and whether there are any phenomena of corruption and waste. At the same time, this work must be regarded as an important part of the examination of preferential treatment work. The income and expenditure and use of grain for substitute farming, in addition to being checked by the relevant government departments, must also be publicized to the masses for inspection. I think that the method of publicizing can imitate the method of publicizing donations for resisting US aggression and aiding Korea, and list them by administrative unit. The county publishes the amount of grain and money paid by each district and used in each district; the district publishes the amount of grain and money paid by each township or administrative village and used in each township or administrative village; each township or administrative village publishes the amount of grain and money paid by each household and the number of households and the amount of grain and money enjoyed by households receiving substitute farming. In general, the method of posting notices can be used to publicize to the masses. Regarding the county's overall income and expenditure, it should also be explained to the people's representatives in written or oral form at the county people's representative conference.

    在反贪污浪费反官僚主义运动中
    各地应公布代耕粮收支情况
    编辑同志：不久以前，我在河北省武安、肥乡等县的县各界人民代表会议上，听到很多代表要求政府公布代耕粮的收支账目。因此，我建议各地在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，公布代耕粮的收支情形，检查使用是否合理，有无贪污、浪费现象。同时必须把这一工作作为检查优抚工作的重要内容之一。代耕粮的收支及使用情况，除由政府有关部门负责进行检查外，还必须向群众公布，交由群众检查。公布的办法，我以为可以仿照公布抗美援朝捐献款的方法，按行政单位分级开列。县公布所属各区缴纳及使用于各区的代耕粮款数目；区公布所属各乡或行政村缴纳及使用于各乡或行政村的代耕粮款数目；各乡或行政村则公布各户缴纳代耕粮款的数目及享受代耕粮的户数、粮款数目。一般的都可用张榜办法向群众公布。关于全县收支情况，还应该在县各界人民代表会议上，以书面或口头形式向人民代表交代。  毛朝鉴
