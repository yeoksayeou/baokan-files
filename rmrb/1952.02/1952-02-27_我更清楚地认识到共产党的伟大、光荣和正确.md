    I More Clearly Recognize the Greatness, Glory, and Correctness of the Communist Party
    Ji Kaifu, Youth League Member, Wuhan Second Municipal Hospital
    I am a staff member of the Medical Affairs Department and a clerk in the President's office at Wuhan Second Municipal Hospital, and a member of the Youth League. A theft occurred at our hospital, and I was falsely accused of being the thief, being arrested and detained by the Public Security Bureau twice, for a total of more than eight months. This unjust accusation was finally clarified under the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, which allowed me to more clearly recognize the greatness, glory, and correctness of the Communist Party, and to more clearly recognize the brilliance and greatness of Chairman Mao.
    The theft occurred on April 12, 1951. At that time, there were many scattered banknotes in the corridor. I arrived at the scene shortly after the incident and found several scattered banknotes on the floor of the office, facing the office of the President and the Supervisory Committee. I also saw a package on the iron pole at the corner of the balcony near the President and Supervisory Committee's office. Doctor Shi Linghui and I also saw Wang Qing, a member of the hospital's Supervisory Committee, standing alone on the balcony with his back to us, and his expression was very unnatural, somewhat panicked, with sweat on his forehead. At this time, Wang Qing also asked people to pick up the scattered banknotes on the ground. From these phenomena, I had great suspicion of Wang Qing, and immediately called the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. They sent people to investigate. At this time, my thoughts were struggling: Should I speak of my suspicions? If I speak, Wang Qing is a member of the Supervisory Committee; if I don't speak, this is an important clue that would greatly help solve the case. Later, thinking that I am a member of the Youth League, I should uphold the truth and have the obligation to help the Public Security Bureau clarify the problem, I resolutely reported my findings and suspicions. At the same time, I also reported my findings to Wu Yixun, the Deputy Secretary of the League branch and Security Committee member of the organization, hoping that he would pay attention to Wang Qing's actions. Later, I heard that he had secretly reported my opinion to Wang Qing. I also reported my opinion to Sun Mailing, a member of the Party branch, and Qiao Huanmin, the secretary of the League branch.
    On the night of April 14, the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau arrested me under the pretext of "talking," inquiring about my history and my views on Wang Qing. Later, because they did not get any useful information, they released me at 8 p.m. on the 15th. At 10 a.m. on the 17th, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested me again on the charge of "deliberately spreading banknotes to frame the leadership." During the eight months of imprisonment until I was released on December 23, although I felt wronged and suffered some torture, I did not resent the Party and the government. I always believed that the People's Government under the leadership of the Communist Party would surely clear my name and clarify the truth.
    As expected, in November of last year, the higher Party committee and the People's Government organized a joint inspection team of eleven units to investigate this issue. The inspection team fully promoted democracy, listened to everyone's opinions, and the truth of the theft was finally clarified. It turned out that the thief was Wang Qing. He conspired with Song Ying, the former Deputy Director of the Wuhan Municipal People's Government Health Bureau, and, with the support of Zhou Jifang, the former Deputy Mayor of Wuhan, ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest me. The reason they wanted to frame me was because in the autumn of 1950, I had waged a resolute struggle against Zhou Jifang and Song Ying's suppression of democracy and violation of human rights and the law, and filed a complaint with the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and they harbored resentment towards me. But there is only one truth. Zhou Jifang, Song Ying, Wang Qing, and others, who disregarded the law and used their positions to frame cadres, have been arrested and brought to justice by the government, and I have regained my freedom. I deeply hate the anti-Party behavior of Zhou Jifang, Song Ying, and others. These dregs have finally been punished by Party discipline and the law. This proves that the Party and the government are selfless and truly serve the people.
    After I was released from prison, my colleagues at the hospital warmly welcomed me and cared for me. Due to the torture I suffered in the eight months, my blood pressure was a little high, and the hospital leadership advised me to be hospitalized for recuperation. During this period, Comrade Deng Zihui, Second Secretary of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Central South Military and Political Committee, Comrade Lu Chao, Minister of the Organization Department of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, Comrade Tian Yiqin, Secretary of the Wuhan Fourth District Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Comrade Cao Guibin, Deputy Secretary, all came to visit me in person. Comrade Deng Zihui personally instructed Yang Guangdi, the President of our hospital, to waive my medical expenses during the recuperation period and to pay me my salary after my arrest, which made me feel that the Party cares for and loves its children even more than parents do. In mid-May 1950, the League organization had mistakenly suspended my League membership. Now that the truth of the theft has been clarified, the League organization has restored my League membership, assigned me to a group to participate in organizational life, and encouraged me to resolutely fight against unhealthy tendencies. These things have given me unspeakable comfort and gratitude.
    In order to repay the Party and the people for their support and care, I have decided to recuperate with peace of mind so that I can return to my post as soon as possible and make up for the work losses during my arrest. During the recuperation period, I have participated in the hospital's anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. At the same time, I have declared to the hospital that I will donate all my salary during the period of my arrest to support the Volunteer Army. My work is not good enough. In the future, under the education of the Party and the League, I will study hard, transform my thinking, strengthen my mass concept, and serve the people wholeheartedly.

    我更清楚地认识到共产党的伟大、光荣和正确
    武汉市立第二医院青年团员  纪凯夫
    我是武汉市立第二医院的医务科员兼院长室文书，是个青年团员。我们医院曾发生一次盗款案件，我被诬为盗款人，先后两次被公安局逮捕扣押一共八个多月。这不白之冤终于在共产党、人民政府的正确领导下完全弄清楚，从而使我更清楚地认识到共产党的伟大、光荣和正确，更清楚地认识到毛主席的英明和伟大。
    盗款案发生在一九五一年四月十二日，当时走廊上丢散的钞票很多。事件发生不久我到了现场，发现办公室地上有几张散落的钞票，方向是向着院长监委办公室的。我又看见靠院长监委办公室的阳台旁的墙角处有一个包袱放在铁电杆上。我和史灵慧大夫又看见本院监委王清一个人在阳台上背面站着，而且脸上的表情极不自然，有些惊慌的样子，额上有汗。这时王清又叫人把散在地上的钞票拾起来。从这些现象看，我对王清有极大的怀疑，就马上打电话给公安四分局。他们派了人前来侦查。这时我的思想在斗争：我的怀疑讲不讲？讲吧，王清是监委；不讲吧，这是重要线索，对破案有极大帮助。后来想到自己是青年团员，应当坚持真理，并且有义务帮助公安局弄清问题，我就坚决地把发现的情况和怀疑作了报告。同时我也同样向机关团支部副书记兼保卫委员吴义勋作了报告，希望他注意王清的行动。后来听说他把我的意见向王清作了密报。我又把我的意见向党支部委员孙麦龄和团支部书记乔焕民作了报告。
    四月十四日深夜，公安四分局以“谈谈”为名逮捕了我，查问我的历史以及对王清的看法，后来因为没有问出什么问题，在十五日晚八时放了我。到十七日上午十时，市公安总局又以“有计划地散布钞票，陷害领导”的罪名把我逮捕了。入狱后经过数次审讯，我始终没有承认。直到十二月二十三日被释放的八个多月监狱生活中，我虽然感到冤屈和受到一些折磨，但我没有怨恨党和政府，我始终相信在共产党领导下的人民政府，一定能为我洗去这不白之冤，弄清是非。
    果然不出我所料，在去年十一月间，上级党委和人民政府组织了十一个单位的联合检查组对这个问题作了调查。检查组充分发扬民主，听取大家的意见，盗案真相终于弄清楚了。原来盗款的人就是王清。他和前武汉市人民政府卫生局副局长宋瑛密谋，在前武汉市副市长周季方的支持下命令公安局逮捕了我。他们所以要陷害我，是因为我曾在一九五○年秋天对周季方、宋瑛压制民主、违犯人权和法纪的行为作了坚决的斗争，并向中共武汉市委提出控告，他们把我怀恨在心。但真理只有一个，不顾国法，借仗职权陷害干部的周季方、宋瑛、王清等已被政府逮捕法办，我又重新获得自由。我十分痛恨周季方、宋瑛等的反党行为。这些败类，终于受到党纪和国法的制裁了。由此证明党和政府是大公无私的，是真正为人民办事的。
    我出狱以后，医院的同志热情地迎接我，关心我。由于八个多月里所受到的折磨，我的血压有些高，医院领导方面又劝我住院休养。这期间，中共中央中南局第二书记、中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢同志、青年团武汉市工委组织部部长路超同志、青年团武汉市第四区工委书记田益勤同志、副书记曹贵彬同志等都先后亲自来看望我。邓子恢同志亲自面嘱本院杨光第院长免收我休养期间的医药费，照发我被捕后的薪金，使我感到党比父母还关心、爱护自己的子女。一九五○年五月中旬，团的组织曾错误地停止了我的团籍。现在因盗案真相已白，团的组织已恢复我的团籍，把我编入小组过组织生活，并勉励我和不良倾向作坚决斗争的精神。这些，都使我有说不出的安慰和感激。
    为了报答党和人民对我的支持和关怀，我决定安心休养，以便早日回到工作岗位，弥补被捕期间的工作损失。在休养期中，我已参加医院的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。同时我已向院方声明，把被捕期间的薪金全部捐献，支援志愿军。我的工作做得还不够。我今后要在党、团的教育下，努力学习，改造思想，加强群众观念，全心全意为人民服务。
