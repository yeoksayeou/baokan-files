Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 3rd. The Chongqing Municipal People's Government, acting on tips from the public, has cracked down on the secret organization "Star Four Dinner Party" formed by private iron and steel machinery profiteers. They bribed personnel from state-owned enterprises, monopolized government processing orders, and engaged in a planned and organized theft of over 12 billion yuan in state property, a serious case. The main culprits, Gao Gongmao, Wen Renjie, Zhou Yingbo, Liu Yusan, and Li Hang, have been arrested by the Municipal People's Government and will be severely punished according to the law.

The criminal activities of the "Star Four Dinner Party" began in July 1950. At that time, the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway began construction, and various construction projects gradually resumed, leading to an increase in processing orders from state-owned iron and steel machinery factories to private iron and steel machinery businesses. Profiteers such as Gao Gongmao, manager of Chongqing Minsheng Machinery Factory, Yin Renji, manager of Xinmin Machinery Factory (a counter-revolutionary who was arrested earlier by the Chongqing Municipal People's Government), Wen Renjie, manager of Dalai Agricultural Machinery Factory, Zhou Yingbo, manager of Hengshun Machinery Factory, Liu Yusan, manager of Dachuan Industrial Company, and Li Hang, manager of Huigong Iron Factory, believed there was an opportunity to exploit. They, with Gao Gongmao and Yin Renji as initiators, united twelve larger private iron and steel machinery merchants, including Yuxin Steel Factory, Ronghua Machinery Factory, Cooperative Hardware Factory, Shanghai Machinery Factory, Zhendan Machinery Factory, and Shunchang Machinery Factory. Under the guise of "business research," they organized the secret "Star Four Dinner Party" to serve as a command center for monopolizing government processing orders, squeezing out small and medium-sized manufacturers, and stealing state property. Every Thursday, these twelve profiteers secretly gathered to discuss methods of theft. They determined that they must install spies within state-owned enterprises to work in collusion, in order to achieve their thieving goals. They then used methods such as "treating to dinner," "giving gifts," and "borrowing money" to bribe Zhou Shaowen and Chen Songbai (both of whom were arrested earlier), personnel in charge of outsourced projects at the state-owned 101 Steel Factory.

The main crimes of the "Star Four Dinner Party" culprits are as follows: First, internal spies stole engineering plans and blueprints. After secret agreements at the "Star Four Dinner Party," the profiteers uniformly raised the price of materials and labor for government orders. According to preliminary calculations for nineteen items, they stole more than 3.14 billion yuan in state property. For example, for the twenty-five sets of railroad switches ordered by the Southwest Railway Bureau, the profiteers "consulted" and collectively inflated prices, falsely reporting the amount of iron used for the base plates from 400 kilograms to 660 kilograms, resulting in a loss of over 300 million yuan in state property. Second, they deliberately delayed construction and failed to fulfill order contracts, using advance payments for orders to seek exorbitant profits, causing the state to lose over 7.5 billion yuan. However, these profiteers colluded with Zhou Shaowen, Chen Songbai, and others to falsely accuse state-owned enterprises of "deliberately delaying acceptance." Third, they cut corners, underreported the weight, misrepresented the length, overreported wages, and added excessive amounts of waste material. The profiteers, according to the engineering drawings, negotiated a uniform standard for cutting corners, making it difficult to compare the finished products. Internal spies Zhou Shaowen, Chen Songbai, and others never weighed the items during acceptance and prevented others from doing so, causing significant losses to the state. Xinmin Machinery Factory, when undertaking ironwork projects, even mixed in over 50 percent of scrap iron. Dalai, Xinmin, Cooperative, and other factories, when contracting three projects from the 101 Factory, stole over 340 million yuan in state property by cutting corners. Fourth, they over-claimed materials. For example, when Xinmin Factory undertook Project No. 63 of the 101 Factory, it over-claimed angle iron by 170 percent through internal spies Zhou Shaowen, Chen Songbai, and others. Preliminary inspections of only Xinmin, Hengshun, and five other factories revealed that the value of the over-claimed materials amounted to more than 365 million yuan. Fifth, they delayed or failed to pay for materials. When these profiteers contracted state orders and received materials at a set price as an advance payment, they first obtained the materials through Zhou Shaowen and Chen Songbai, but did not include them in the advance payment for the order, thereby reaping huge profits. Later, they delayed paying for the materials. The delay in material payments by factories such as Dalai alone caused the state to lose over 479 million yuan. In addition to the above crimes, when state-owned enterprises supplied materials for orders, these profiteers falsely reported transportation costs; when calculating the amount of the order, they did not calculate according to the real-time price on the payment date, but according to the highest price during the contract signing process, which also caused huge losses to state property.

These profiteers not only tried every possible means to steal state property, but also used their monopolistic organization to squeeze and exploit small and medium-sized manufacturers. For example, Shanghai Machinery Factory contracted a batch of state orders for 40 million yuan, did not do any of the work themselves, and subcontracted it to other small factories for 17 million yuan, thereby stealing 23 million yuan. The serious crimes of these profiteers were finally exposed by fellow tradesmen in Chongqing's large-scale anti-bribery and anti-theft of state property movement. After the Municipal People's Government investigated and verified the facts and arrested the main culprits, people from all walks of life in Chongqing, including small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, were delighted.

    重庆破获奸商非法组织“星四聚餐会”  
    大奸商高功懋等有计划地盗窃国家财产百二十多亿元已被捕法办
    【新华社重庆三日电】重庆市人民政府接受人民检举，破获私营钢铁机器业奸商秘密组织“星四聚餐会”，收买国营企业人员，垄断政府加工定货，有组织有计划地盗窃国家财产一百二十多亿元以上的严重案件。主犯高功懋、闻人杰、周英伯、刘雨三、李杭等五人已由市人民政府逮捕，将依法严惩。
    “星四聚餐会”的罪恶活动，开始于一九五零年七月。当时成渝铁路开始修建，各项建设事业逐步恢复，国营钢铁机器工厂向私营钢铁机器业加工定货增多。重庆私营民生机器厂经理高功懋、新民机器厂经理印仁基（反革命分子，早为重庆市人民政府逮捕）、大来农业机械厂经理闻人杰、恒顺机器厂经理周英伯、大川实业公司经理刘雨三、惠工铁工厂经理李杭等奸商认为有机可乘，就以高功懋、印仁基两犯为发起人，联合渝鑫钢铁厂、荣华机器厂、合作五金工厂、上海机器厂、震旦机器厂、顺昌机器厂等共十二家较大私营钢铁机器商，以“研究业务”为名，组织秘密的“星四聚餐会”，作为垄断政府加工定货、排挤中小厂商和盗窃国家财产的指挥部。每逢星期四，这十二家奸商就秘密集会，商讨盗窃办法。他们认定必须在国营企业内安设奸细，里应外合，才能达到盗窃目的，便先后以“请客”、“送礼”、“借钱”等手段收买了国营一零一钢厂的外包工程人员周绍文和陈松柏（该二犯早被逮捕）等。
    “星四聚餐会”各犯主要罪行如下：第一，由内奸窃取工程计划和蓝图，在“星四聚餐会”秘密协议后，各奸商向国营企业统一抬高定货工料，据十九件物品的初步计算，即窃取国家财产三十一亿四千多万元。仅西南铁路局定购的二十五付岔道，经各奸商“协商”集体哄抬价格，将其中垫板用料由四百公斤元铁虚报为六百六十公斤，国家财产就损失三亿多元。第二，故意拖延施工，不执行定货合同，利用定货预付款，牟取暴利，使国家损失七十五亿元以上。但是这些奸商和周绍文、陈松柏等串通，反而诬蔑国营企业“故意拖延验收”。第三，偷工减料，虚报重量，虚报长度，多报工资，多搀废料。奸商按照工程图样，协商统一偷工减料标准，使人在成品中不易比较；内奸周绍文、陈松柏等从不过磅验收，并阻止他人验收，使国家蒙受重大损失。新民机器厂承做铁工工程，竟搀废铁百分之五十以上。大来、新民、合作等厂承包一零一厂某三项工程，即偷工减料盗窃国家财产三亿四千多万元。第四，超额领取材料。如新民厂承做一零一厂第六十三号工程时，通过内奸周绍文、陈松柏等，竟超领角铁百分之一百七十。仅据对新民、恒顺等七家厂商的初步检查，超领的材料价值便有三亿六千五百多万元。第五，迟补或不补材料款。这些奸商们承包国家定货时，如系计价拨料充付定金，就通过周绍文和陈松柏等先取得材料，但不计入预付定货款内，从中获得暴利；以后又迟迟不交料款。仅大来等厂因拖交料款，就使国家损失四亿七千九百多万元。除以上种种罪行外，这些奸商在国家企业机构供应定货材料时，便虚报运费；计算定货款项时，不按付款日折实牌价计算，而以签订合同过程中最高牌价计算，这些也使国家财产蒙受巨大损失。
    这些奸商不仅千方百计盗窃国家财产，并且通过其垄断组织极力排挤和剥削中、小厂商。如上海机器厂以四千万元承包一批国家定货，自己一点未做，而以一千七百万转包给其他小厂，从中盗骗两千三百万元。这些奸商的重大罪行，在重庆市各行业大张旗鼓地反对行贿反对盗窃国家财产的运动中，终于被同业检举出来。市人民政府调查属实将主犯逮捕后，重庆市各界人民包括中、小工商业者无不称快。
