Beijing Organizes Over Two Hundred "Mayor's Representative Work Groups"
Deeply Penetrate the Masses, Promote the Anti-Corruption Campaign Policies, and Accept Accusations
Mayor Peng Zhen Orders the Establishment of a Handling Committee Responsible for Addressing All Opinions Raised by Citizens

In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the work groups representing Beijing Municipal People's Government Mayor Peng Zhen and meeting with the citizen masses concluded their visits to the masses on January 23rd. Mayor Peng Zhen deeply appreciated the active support of the citizen masses and ordered the establishment of a handling committee, based on the spirit of answering every question, responsible for handling the issues of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy reported by citizens, as well as responding to other opinions of citizens. This committee is headed by Beijing Deputy Mayor Wu Han and Beijing Deputy Public Security Bureau Chief Feng Jiping.

The "Mayor's Representative Work Groups" totaled 923 people, including 500 cadres from the Beijing Public Security Bureau, 93 university professors, and 330 university students. The work groups were organized into 253 groups, dispatched to various districts and police station jurisdictions throughout the city to carry out work. During the four days of work, the work groups held more than 300 mass meetings, more than 2,000 various discussion sessions, and visited more than 7,000 citizen households. More than 300,000 citizens were directly educated in four days, and a total of 10,986 pieces of accusation and confession materials were received from citizens.

The working steps of the "Mayor's Representative Work Groups" varied slightly from group to group, but were generally as follows: After studying the policies on opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy, the personnel of the work groups went to designated areas, jointly studied the situation with personnel from local police stations and economy inspection committees, and convened meetings of activists to determine specific working methods. Activists then notified the masses of the arrival of the work groups. Then, the work groups convened mass meetings to formally meet with the masses, explain the tasks of the work groups, and explain in detail the policies of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement according to local conditions, demonstrate the government's determination, and call on the masses to boldly report. Then, the personnel of the work groups went deep into the masses, conducted individual visits, held small-scale discussion sessions, organized temporary reception stations, and set up accusation boxes. When holding mass meetings and conducting discussions, visits, and receiving accusations, the jurisdiction cadres and all other staff members were excused. Finally, the work groups summarized the work and bid farewell to the citizen masses.

The stage of the work groups going deep into the masses was the most important stage in the entire work process for obtaining materials, lasting approximately three days. The work groups were able to achieve such great results in a short period of three days for the following reasons: First, the masses understood the government's policies and determination, and the work groups were representatives of the mayor, which made the masses very excited. Secondly, all personnel of the police station were excused, and prior to this, the heads of the police stations had already conducted self-criticisms in front of the masses, and the government had taken appropriate actions against some erring staff members, so the masses had even more confidence. Third, the work groups closely relied on the basic masses, and the working methods were extremely convenient for the masses. Citizen masses could write accusation letters, talk face-to-face, talk at the meeting, or talk after the meeting. Most of the comrades in the work groups, fearing that the citizens were unwilling to go to the police station, set up reception stations in the homes of the citizens.

Because of this, the work groups were warmly welcomed and supported by the masses. Some activists did not eat all day, notifying households one by one, telling everyone they met. The number of people attending the mass meetings was unprecedented. Even old ladies who never attended meetings wanted to meet the mayor's representatives. Although the weather was cold and windy, the mood of the masses at the meeting remained high and the order was orderly. Some people used to be afraid of meetings, but this time they were reluctant to go back after the meeting was over. Citizens scrambled to invite the work groups to work in their homes, and regarded it as an honor. Some even automatically patrolled outside the rooms where the work group members lived all night. Citizen Wang Shixiang said: "I have never seen such an anti-corruption campaign in my forty years. With Chairman Mao and Mayor Peng supporting us, what are we afraid of?" Some people said: "The mayor is afraid that we have concerns, and the cadres of this jurisdiction are not allowed to participate in the meeting, so we can say anything."

Under such a high mood, the citizen masses exposed corruption and waste events and bureaucratic behaviors. A blind man in Guanzhuang in the eastern suburbs groped for more than a mile to report the village cadres. Some housewives, who originally did not intend to report the police who embezzled donations for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, fearing that they would lose their jobs, now said: "We cannot let the mistake go on. Jobs are small, resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea is a big deal." The masses in Liulangzhuang in the western suburbs did not dare to speak for two years about the village cadres' embezzlement of 30 to 40 million yuan, but now they have exposed it. The shop assistants and apprentices in factories and shops also automatically held meetings, gathered materials, and reported the bosses. Citizens in the ninth district alone reported more than a dozen industrial and commercial households who evaded taxes of 100 to 300 million yuan. In addition, there were also wives reporting their husbands, and children reporting their parents. In addition to reporting cadres' corruption, waste, bribery, blackmail, extortion, and capitalists' bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, and other illegal behaviors, the masses also reported cases of drug abuse, robbery, theft, and counter-revolutionary activities; even marriage problems were raised. Someone said: "I myself know that this has nothing to do with anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, but I trust the government, so I ask for it to be handled."

The harvest of the work groups far exceeded the expected target. This step of work made the city-wide anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, which had already been launched vigorously, more in-depth. Some citizens originally thought that opposing corruption and waste meant not allowing people to eat well and dress well, and giving gifts to relatives and friends was also bribery; now they said: "I was originally fooled by rumors. The mayor's representative explained it, and it all became clear." The meaning of opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy became a household name. The broad masses of the city participated in this struggle with high spirits. The harvest of the work groups was not limited to this. This work also allowed the citizen masses to speak their minds, and to a certain extent, played the role of democratic reform of the urban grassroots regime. This is a further promotion of the democratic spirit in the work of the regime, and thus further strengthened the ties between the masses and the government and the Communist Party, and further enhanced the prestige of the People's Government and the Communist Party.

The citizen masses reluctantly bid farewell to the mayor's representatives, and eagerly hoped that the mayor would often send representatives to listen to their opinions in the future. Mayor Peng attached great importance to this opinion and planned to establish this work as a system so that government staff would be placed under the constant supervision of the people, and to constantly listen directly to the opinions of the people to improve the work of the government.

    北京市组织二百多个“市长代表工作组”
    深入群众宣传反贪污运动政策接受检举
    彭真市长下令成立处理委员会负责处理市民提出的一切意见
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，代表北京市人民政府彭真市长和市民群众见面的工作组，在一月二十三日结束了访问群众的工作。彭真市长对市民群众的积极支持深为感谢，下令成立了处理委员会，根据有问必答的精神，负责处理市民群众所检举的贪污浪费和官僚主义问题，以及答复市民的其他意见。这个委员会由北京市副市长吴晗和北京市公安局副局长冯基平负责。
    “市长代表工作组”共九百二十三人，其中北京市公安局干部五百人、大学教授九十三人、大学生三百三十人。工作组共编成二百五十三个，分赴全市各区各派出所管界进行工作。工作组在进行工作的四天内，共召开群众大会三百多次，各种座谈会两千多次，并访问了市民的家庭七千多户。四天内受到直接宣传的市民在三十万人以上，市民检举和坦白的材料共计一万零九百八十六件。
    “市长代表工作组”的工作步骤各组略有不同，大体上是这样：工作组的人员在学习反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的政策以后，就分别前往指定地区，和当地派出所及节约检查委员会的人员共同研究情况，并召开积极分子会议，确定具体工作办法。积极分子随即把工作组到来的消息分别通知群众。然后，工作组召开群众大会，正式和群众见面，说明工作组的任务，并根据当地情况详尽说明反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的政策，表明政府的决心，号召群众大胆检举。然后，工作组的人员分别深入群众，进行个别访问，召开小型座谈会，组织临时接待站及设立检举箱。在召开群众大会和进行座谈、访问、接待检举等工作时，管界干部及其他一切工作人员一律回避。最后，工作组总结工作并向市民群众告别。
    工作组深入群众的阶段是全部工作过程中最重要的获取材料的阶段，为时约计三天。工作组之所以能在短短的三天之内获得如此巨大的成绩，有以下几个原因：第一，群众了解了政府的政策和决心，工作组又是市长的代表，这就使群众十分兴奋。其次，派出所人员全体回避，而在此以前，各派出所的负责人已在群众面前进行过检讨，政府对有些犯错误的工作人员也已分别作了适当的处理，因此群众更具有信心。第三，工作组紧紧依靠了基本群众，工作的方式对群众又极为便利。市民群众可以写检举书，可以当面谈，可以在会上谈，也可以在会后谈。大部工作组的同志恐怕市民不愿意到派出所去，就把接待站设在市民家里。
    正因为这样，工作组受到了群众的热烈欢迎和拥护。有的积极分子一整天不吃饭，挨户通知，逢人便讲。参加群众大会的人空前踊跃。甚至从不参加会议的老太太也要去见见市长的代表。虽然天冷风大，会上群众情绪始终高涨，秩序井然。有些人过去怕开会，但是他们这次在散会以后还迟迟不愿回去。市民争相邀请工作组到自己家里去办公，并以此为光荣。更有人自动在工作组人员住的屋子外面整夜巡逻。市民王世祥说：“我活了四十年没有见过这样反贪污的。有毛主席和彭市长替我们撑腰，我们还怕什么。”有人说：“市长怕我们有顾虑，开会不要本管界的干部参加，我们什么都可以说。”
    在这样高涨的情绪下，市民群众纷纷揭发贪污浪费事件和官僚主义的行为。东郊关厢一个瞎子摸了一里多路，去检举村干部。有的家庭妇女，原不打算检举贪污抗美援朝捐款的警察，怕打掉他的饭碗，现在说：“不能将错就错，饭碗事小，抗美援朝事大。”西郊六郎庄的群众对村干部贪污三、四千万元的问题，两年没有敢讲，现在揭发了。工厂商店的店员、学徒更自动开会，集中材料，检举老板。仅第九区的市民群众就检举了漏税一亿到三、四亿的工商户十几家。此外，也有妻子检举丈夫的，也有儿女检举父母的。群众除了检举干部的贪污浪费、受贿、敲诈、勒索和资本家的行贿、漏税、盗窃国家资财等非法行为外，还检举了吸毒、抢劫、偷窃以及反革命活动的案件；甚至连婚姻问题等也提出来了。有人说：“我自己也知道这和反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义无关，但是我相信政府，所以要求处理。”
    工作组的收获远远超过了预期的目标。这一步工作使已大张旗鼓展开的全市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动更深入了一步。市民中有些人原来以为反对贪污浪费就是不叫人吃好的穿好的，亲友送礼也是行贿；现在他们说：“原来上了谣言的当。市长的代表一说明，就全明白了。”反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的意义成了家喻户晓的事。全市广大群众都情绪高涨地参加这个斗争。工作组的收获还不止此，这个工作还使市民群众说出了心里的话，在一定程度上起了城市基层政权的民主改革作用。这是政权工作中民主精神的更进一步地发扬，因而也就进一步密切了群众和政府以及共产党的联系，进一步提高了人民政府和共产党的威信。
    市民群众恋恋不舍地送别了市长的代表，并且热切希望市长以后经常这样派遣代表去听取他们的意见。彭市长对这个意见极为重视，打算把这个工作确定为制度，以便把政府工作人员放在人民的经常监督之下，和经常直接听取人民的意见来改进政府的工作。（新华社）
