    Our Country's First Large Reservoir
    Construction Begins on Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River
    Construction on the large-scale Yongding River Guanting Reservoir project began last winter. Once completed, the Guanting Reservoir will have a capacity of 2.09 billion cubic meters. It is the first large reservoir built in our country, and its site is located in Guanting Village, Huailai County, Chahar Province.
    The Yongding River originates in high mountains and flows rapidly, making it prone to breaches during flood seasons in the lower reaches. In order to completely eliminate the threat of floods from the Yongding River, the People's Government, in addition to building dikes for prevention and control in the lower reaches, decided as early as the 1949 Joint Conference on Water Conservancy of Liberated Areas convened by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, to build three reservoirs upstream and midstream: Shixiali, Guanting, and Magezhuang. It was decided to build the Guanting Reservoir first. At the end of 1949, the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Office (now renamed the Guanting Reservoir Engineering Bureau) was established and began all the preparatory work for the reservoir construction. By October of last year, this preparatory work, including design, geological drilling of the dam site, material preparation, and construction of bridges and housing on the construction site, had been largely completed. The reservoir construction project then officially started. The planned construction includes an earth dam, a spillway tunnel, and a spillway, all of which are very large in scale. Currently, the spillway tunnel is under construction, with more than 1,000 stonemasons and more than 2,000 laborers initially working on it. This spring, the scale of construction will be further expanded, and the entire project is expected to be completed before the flood season in 1953.
    The Guanting Reservoir is the largest of the three reservoirs to be built in the plan to harness the Yongding River. Once completed, this reservoir will eliminate the threat of floods to the lower reaches of the Yongding River and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin. The reservoir's water storage can also be used for irrigation, power generation, and shipping. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 我国的第一个大水库  永定河官厅水库开工

    我国的第一个大水库  
    永定河官厅水库开工
    规模巨大的永定河官厅水库工程已在去冬开工。官厅水库修成后能容水二十点九亿立方公尺，是我国修建的第一个大水库，库址在察哈尔省怀来县的官厅村。
    永定河源高流急，下游在洪水时期容易溃决。人民政府为根绝永定河水患，除在下游修堤防治以外，早在一九四九年中央人民政府水利部召开的各解放区水利联席会议上，就决定要在上游和中游修建石匣里、官厅、马各庄等三个水库，并决定先修官厅水库。一九四九年年底官厅水库工程处（现改为官厅水库工程局）就已成立，着手进行建库的一切准备工作。到去年十月，这个准备工作包括设计、钻探坝址地质、备料、修建工地桥梁、房舍等已大体完成。建库工程随即正式开工。计划要修的工程，包括一个土坝、一个泄水隧洞和一个溢洪道，规模都是很大的。现在正在修的是泄水隧洞，一开始上工的就有一千多名石工和两千多名民工。今年春天，施工的规模还要扩大，全部工程预计在一九五三年汛期前可以完成。
    官厅水库是根治永定河计划中所要修建的三个水库中的最大的一个。这个水库修成后，就解除了永定河下游地区和北京、天津两市所受的洪水威胁，水库蓄水还可供灌溉、发电和航运之用。  （新华社）
