Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 11th—At the delegates' conference of the Korean armistice negotiations on the 11th, General Nam Il, our chief representative, once again refuted the other side's proposal regarding agenda item five, as well as the other side's speech at the meeting on the 10th (the text of General Nam Il's speech follows).

    At the staff meeting on agenda item three, our staff pointed out: The other side's proposed limit of 40,000 military personnel per month for rotation, excluding military personnel on short leave and temporary duty, since the beginning of the meeting, as well as the other side's suggestion on the 10th of eight specific rear ports for each side, are far beyond what is needed. Since our side has already agreed that the rotation limit proposed by the other side may exclude military personnel on short leave and temporary duty, we hope that the other side will seriously consider and accept our reasonable suggestion of rotating 25,000 people per month, and stipulate that they enter and exit through three rear ports on each side.

    At the staff meeting on agenda item four, in addition to the two sides continuing to exchange opinions on the specific arrangements for civilians returning to their hometowns, our representative also summarized the discussions at the staff meetings in the past few days, pointing out that the important differences between the two sides regarding agenda item four are four points: First, the most important basic difference is that our side advocates the unconditional release and repatriation of all prisoners of war on both sides after the armistice, while the other side insists on conditional release and repatriation, i.e., so-called "voluntary repatriation." Second, regarding the issue of displaced civilians returning to their hometowns after the armistice, the other side insists on certain guarantees. Third, regarding the deadline for both sides to complete the repatriation of prisoners of war, the other side demands two different deadlines based on inequality. Fourth, for some clauses, the other side insists on making redundant and unnecessary detailed provisions. Our representative further pointed out that the differences between the two sides have been largely resolved due to our proposal on February 3; however, the draft proposed by the other side on February 7 not only failed to move forward on that basis, but also added difficulties on certain issues. Therefore, only when the other side abandons its unreasonable insistence and obstacles to progress can agenda item four achieve progress and resolution.
General Nam Il's full speech at the delegates' conference on the 11th regarding agenda item five:

    We have studied your statement of yesterday again, and our side cannot agree with your statement of yesterday. As early as the first day of the armistice negotiations, our side raised the issue of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea, which is closely related to the Korean armistice. However, since your side has consistently avoided discussing and deciding on this issue, which is closely related to the Korean armistice, by claiming that the armistice negotiations cannot make decisions on political issues, the two sides have clearly reached an understanding to leave this issue, together with the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, to a political conference at a higher level of the governments of the countries concerned on both sides for discussion and resolution. In accordance with this spirit, the two sides agreed to stipulate agenda item five as "matters to be recommended to the governments of the countries concerned on both sides." Since this agenda item clearly stipulates "matters to be recommended to the governments of the countries concerned on both sides," the two sides do not need to and have not made any decisions on the substance of the recommendations themselves during the armistice negotiations. Therefore, the first sentence in your proposal is completely superfluous and unnecessary.

    On the other hand, it is also incorrect to say that the commanders of both sides have not considered the issue of a political solution to Korea at all. The purpose of the military armistice negotiations is to end the hostile acts between the two sides in Korea, withdraw all foreign troops from Korea, and create basic conditions for the Korean people to solve their own problems. During the armistice negotiations, both sides have repeatedly stated that the armistice in Korea should be a bridge leading to a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. In the discussion of agenda item three, both sides more clearly agreed on the purpose of "guaranteeing the stability of the military armistice to facilitate the conduct of a political conference at a higher level on both sides to achieve a peaceful settlement." Therefore, if the true purpose of your side's agreement to hold armistice negotiations is not to lead to a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, that is something in your mind, but our side has considered the issue of a political solution to Korea and has conducted the armistice negotiations based on this purpose. And according to the understanding between the two sides in the meeting and the agreed-upon text, your side not only approves of a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, but also agrees to convene a political conference at a higher level on both sides.

    Secondly, since the agenda stipulates that recommendations should be made to the governments of the countries concerned on both sides, and the two sides have agreed that this recommendation should aim at guaranteeing the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, this recommendation should not be buried in vague and empty wording, let alone allow vague and empty recommendations to delay the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The so-called "appropriate political methods" and the so-called "steps to be taken within three months" in your proposal essentially negate the convening of a political conference of the governments of the countries concerned on both sides, which is necessary for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and negate the practical significance of convening this political conference within three months to achieve the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. Recommendations are by no means instructions, which is very clear. And the reasonable recommendations to the governments of the countries concerned on both sides are a concrete manifestation of the sincerity of the commanders of both sides in the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, which is also very clear. Any attempt to use vague and empty recommendations as a perfunctory measure can only be interpreted as an intentional delay in the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

    Thirdly, as our side has repeatedly pointed out, the Korean issue is not isolated, and the consolidation of peace in Korea depends on the settlement of other issues related to peace in Korea. In order to guarantee the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and consolidate peace in Korea, the political conference of the governments of the countries concerned on both sides should discuss and decide on other issues directly related to peace in Korea. Your statement yesterday on this point was unfounded. Your purpose is only to limit the issues that the political conference of the governments of the countries concerned on both sides should discuss and decide. In order to quickly achieve the purpose of peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, I once again suggest that your side seriously consider and accept our proposal.

    南日将军在双方代表团大会上
    再斥美方关于第五项议程的提案
    第三、第四两项议程参谋会议上我方坚持合理建议
    【新华社开城十一日电】十一日朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团大会上，我方首席代表南日将军再次驳斥了对方关于第五项议程的提案，以及对方在十日会上的发言（南日将军的发言见后）。
    第三项议程的参谋会议上，我方参谋人员指出：对方自会议开始以后所提出的不包括短期休假和担任临时任务的军事人员在内，每月四万人的军事人员轮换限额，以及对方在十日所提出的各方八个特定后方口岸的建议，都是远超出需要的。我方既已同意对方所提轮换限额可不包括短期休假及担任临时任务的军事人员在内，希望对方郑重考虑并接受我方所提每月轮换二万五千人，并规定，他们经由双方各三个后方口岸进出的合理建议。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，除双方就平民返乡的具体安排方面继续交换意见外，我方代表并总结了这几天参谋会议上的讨论，指出双方关于第四项议程的重要的分歧有四点：第一，最主要的基本分歧是我方主张停战后无条件释放和遣返双方全部战俘，而对方则坚持有条件的释放和遣返，即所谓“自愿遣送”。第二，关于停战后流离失所的平民返乡问题，对方坚持要什么保证。第三，对于双方完成遣返战俘的期限，对方在不平等的基础上要求分别规定两个不同的期限。第四，对于有些条文，对方主张作多余的不必要的细节规定。我方代表并进一步指出双方之间的分歧，由于我方二月三日的提案，大部分已经获得解决；但对方二月七日提出的草案，却不但没有在那个基础上向前推进，反而在某些问题上增加了困难，因此只有对方放弃他这种无理的坚持和对进展的障碍，第四项议程才能获得进展和解决。南日将军在十一日双方代表团大
    会上关于第五项议程的发言全文
    我们再次研究了你方昨日的发言，对于你方昨日的发言我方不能同意。早在停战谈判开始的第一天，我方就提出了与朝鲜停战有着密切关联的一切外国军队撤出朝鲜的问题。但由于你方始终藉口停战谈判不能对政治问题作出决定，避免在停战谈判中讨论和决定这一与朝鲜停战有着密切关联的问题，因此双方明确达成谅解，将这一问题与朝鲜问题的和平解决，留待双方有关各国政府高一级的政治会议来讨论和解决。根据这一精神，双方同意在议程中规定第五项“向双方有关各国政府建议事项”。既然这一议程明确规定为“向双方有关各国政府建议事项”，那么双方在停战谈判中，对于建议事项本身的实质无需亦并未作出任何决定，因此，你方提案中的第一句是完全多余，而不必要的。
    在另一方面，如果说双方司令官根本没有考虑到有关朝鲜政治解决的问题，那也是不正确的。军事停战谈判的目的就是要终止双方在朝鲜的敌对行为，从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队，为朝鲜人民解决自己的问题创造基本的条件。在停战谈判中，双方都是一再表示在朝鲜的停战应该是导向和平解决朝鲜问题的桥梁。在第三项议程的讨论中，双方更明确协议“保证军事停战的稳定以利双方高一级的政治会议的进行，来达到和平解决”的目的。因此，如果说你方同意举行停战谈判的真正目的，并不是为了导向和平解决朝鲜问题，那是你方心中的事，但我方是考虑到有关朝鲜政治解决的问题，并根据了这一目的来进行停战谈判的。而根据会议中双方的谅解和已达成协议的文字来说，你方是不仅赞成和平解决朝鲜问题，而且是同意了召开双方高一级的政治会议的。
    其次，既然议程规定要向双方有关各国政府提出建议，而双方又已同意这一建议应以保证朝鲜问题的和平解决为目的，就不应该将这项建议埋没在含糊而空洞的措辞之中，更不能容许以含糊而空洞的建议来拖延朝鲜问题的和平解决。你方提案中所谓
    “适当的政治方法”，所谓“三月内采取步骤”，实质上就否定了为和平解决朝鲜问题所必需的、双方有关各国政府的政治会议的召开，否定了三个月内召开这一政治会议以实现朝鲜问题的和平解决的实际意义。建议绝不是指令，这是很清楚的。而向双方有关各国政府的合理建议，是双方司令官对于朝鲜问题的和平解决的诚意的具体表现，同样是很清楚的。任何以含糊而空洞的建议作为搪塞的企图，只能被解释为有意拖延朝鲜问题的和平解决。
    第三，正如我方所一再指出的，朝鲜问题不是孤立的，朝鲜和平的巩固有赖于与朝鲜和平有关的其他问题的解决。为了保证朝鲜问题的和平解决，巩固朝鲜的和平，双方有关各国政府的政治会议就应该讨论和决定与朝鲜和平直接有关的其他问题。你方昨日对于这一点的发言是无的放矢。你方的目的只是限制双方有关各国政府政治会议所应该讨论和决定的问题。为迅速达成朝鲜问题的和平解决的目的，我再次建议你方郑重考虑并接受我方的提案。
