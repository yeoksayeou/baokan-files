    The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has been two years ago. The great and solid friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union established by this treaty will surely achieve eternal development. This treaty unites 700 million people, united under the banner of the most noble common belief—Marxism-Leninism, forming an invincible and magnificent force, which will inevitably have a huge and immeasurable impact on the entire world.
    All the people of China, all the people of the Soviet Union, and all the people in the world who love peace and democracy, love science and culture, oppose imperialism, oppose fascism, and oppose wars of aggression, are celebrating this victorious anniversary with the most joyful and exciting mood.
    In commemorating the signing of such an international friendship treaty that is decisive for world history, the people of the world, especially the Chinese people, express their gratitude to Marshal Stalin and the Soviet government and people. At the same time, they are equally grateful to Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central People's Government, the leaders of the Chinese people.
    When we look back, the unity of the Chinese and Soviet people has achieved today's achievements, which is not accidental.
    The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has a history of more than 30 years. Since the October Revolution, the Soviet people have always deeply cared about the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people with brotherly friendship. The glorious and correct Marxism-Leninism guides the revolutionary movement of the Chinese people; the great teacher of the world's people's revolution, Marshal Stalin, constantly provided practical assistance to the Chinese people's revolution in theory and action.
    Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and the promotion of the great spirit of proletarian internationalism, the relationship between the Soviet government and the Soviet people and the Chinese people has always been friendly. We can prove this from the following major historical facts.
    After the victory of the October Revolution in 1917, the Soviet government automatically declared in December that it would renounce all the illegitimate rights enjoyed by Tsarist Russia in our country.
    In 1919, the Soviet government issued a letter to the Chinese people and the governments of the South and North, reiterating the issue of Sino-Soviet friendship and equality, and expressing its enthusiasm and concern for the Chinese people's movement to break away from imperialist oppression. This declaration was immediately warmly welcomed by Chinese workers, peasants, and young intellectuals. Until 1924, Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations were restored, and a completely equal "Sino-Soviet Beijing Agreement" was signed.
    In 1926, the Soviet Union provided specific assistance to the Chinese revolutionary movement in economic, political, and military aspects, vigorously helping the Northern Expedition. After Chiang Kai-shek seized the fruits of the Chinese people's revolution and betrayed the revolution, in July 1929, he instructed the Northeastern warlord army to launch a shameful adventurous war of armed aggression against the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union did not weaken its concern for the revolutionary cause of our people because of this. This is a stark contrast to the Japanese imperialist aggression in Northeast China at that time. Who is our friend? Who is our enemy? It is easy to recognize in the face of this fact.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the only friend who aided China earliest, most, and most sincerely was the Soviet Union. When the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, the Soviet Union first signed a non-aggression treaty with China on August 21, 1937, providing a lot of assistance in spirit and material. During the most difficult days of the Chinese War of Resistance Against Japan, the Soviet Union not only gave China several unsecured and uncompensated loans, but also defeated the enemy in the battles of Zhanggufeng and Nomonhan, which had a great impact on the Chinese War of Resistance. By 1945, after the Soviet people completely defeated the Hitler gang and the German bandits announced their surrender, the Soviet people, faithful to their obligations as allies, declared war on Japan on August 9, advanced to liberate the Northeast, and forced Japan to surrender unconditionally, enabling the Chinese people's national liberation war to be completed earlier.
    In the Chinese People's Liberation War, the Soviet Union has always sympathized with and supported the Chinese people. In 1949, the Soviet government and the Northeast People's Government signed a one-year trade agreement on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, specifically helping the economic development of the Northeast.
    When the People's Republic of China was founded, the Soviet government was the first to establish diplomatic relations with our country. In the past two years, the representatives of the Soviet government have spoken out righteously on China's issues at various international conferences, opposing the US imperialist aggression and sabotage against China. This shows that the friendship between the Soviet people and the Chinese people is growing stronger and incomparably profound. After the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the two countries then concluded various mutually beneficial and equal economic and trade agreements, which played a great role in our country's recovery and construction work. Just taking the examples of Soviet experts who helped China engage in various construction projects, we deeply feel that their efforts and enthusiasm for the Chinese people's construction cause are worthy of our gratitude and worthy of our learning. For example, the Soviet experts who work in our transportation department, their selfless service spirit, their spirit of absolutely accepting administrative leadership and abiding by work discipline, their simple and hard-working style of work, their spirit of saving money and increasing production for the Chinese people, their work attitude and guidelines of studying technology, using Soviet scientific experience, and combining with China's specific conditions in design and construction, all these performances are truly great. In daily work, they not only take the lead by doing it themselves, but also are good at uniting the masses, educating the masses, and learning from the masses. They impart technical knowledge and skills to ordinary cadres without reservation. Such sincere help from the Soviet government and the Soviet people to the Chinese people is a concrete manifestation of the Soviet people's internationalist spirit. This selfless internationalist spirit is unimaginable in capitalist countries, and it is also something they cannot understand.
    From the above vivid facts about the friendship of the Soviet people to the Chinese people, after more than 30 years of practical tests, we can come to a conclusion: the Soviet Union is the true friend of the Chinese people. However, what about other capitalist countries?
    Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, countries such as Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States have also sent some so-called scholars, teachers, experts, and engineers to China, pretending to be friends of the Chinese people. However, these hypocritical faces were quickly exposed by their acts of theft and espionage. They were all carrying out activities of plundering, exploitation, and fraud under the orders of their capitalist masters, in order to find commodity markets, military bases, and to turn China into their colony.
    Facts are the best orators. All those who have confused ideas about the Soviet Union and illusions about imperialism should awaken in the face of truth and facts.
    For more than 30 years, the history of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people has not only shown that the Soviet people are the true friends of the Chinese people, but also the true friends of all oppressed and enslaved people. At the same time, it also shows that the friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union must be established, consolidated, and developed under the banners of Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao, to become an eternal friendship for generations and become the most reliable factor in transforming the world and transforming mankind.
    On this significant anniversary, the Chinese people, because of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, were able to achieve a major victory, defeat the American beastly army that invaded Korea, stop the US imperialist's crazy plan to expand the war, and strengthen our combat power. This series of facts made us more deeply realize the enormous role and impact of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and at the same time, more deeply realized Chairman Mao's wise scientific foresight, and strengthened the people's faith in Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. Because US imperialism is making a dying struggle, acting as the last bodyguard of capitalism's enslavement of the world, it is now accelerating the collusion with the reactionary forces in Japan, rearming Japan, occupying Taiwan, and supporting the remnants of the Chiang bandits, attempting to invade China and enslave the Chinese people. This is a dead end that has long been doomed. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance two years ago was precisely because it foresaw that US imperialism was going to engage in this set of aggressive plans, and was an early deployment to capture the "paper tiger." Our people across the country are wholeheartedly engaging in the movement to increase production and practice economy under the leadership of Chairman Mao, continuing to strengthen the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, completing the land reform work, transforming various intellectuals, carrying out a vigorous movement against corruption and bribery, and preparing all necessary conditions to launch large-scale economic construction. All of this is the material strength of the Chinese people to commemorate and support the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.
    From 1926 to now, I have been to the great Soviet Union three times. Each time, I received warm hospitality from Soviet friends, and received great encouragement and help for my work and ideological understanding. Each time, I saw the progress of the Soviet Union's nation-building, and I found new things that I could learn from heart. Secondly, our Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party also received spiritual encouragement and a lot of help from Soviet friends during the period of hard struggle and oppression. Because of all this, I feel the greatness of the Soviet people, the deep and sincere friendship of the Soviet people. I thank the Soviet Union, I thank the respectable and lovable Soviet friends. I want to use all my strength to learn from the Soviet Union, to serve the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, to build our country, and to realize socialism and communism to repay the great and deep friendship of the Soviet people.

    苏联是我们中国人民的真正朋友
    章伯钧
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的缔结已两周年了。这个条约所奠定的中苏两国人民伟大的坚固的友谊，必将获得永恒的发展。这个条约把七亿人民团结在一起，团结在最崇高的共同的信念——马克思列宁主义的旗帜下面，形成了不可战胜的雄伟的力量，对于整个世界必然产生巨大的不可限量的影响。
    全中国人民、全苏联人民、全世界爱好和平民主、爱好科学文化、反对帝国主义、反对法西斯主义、反对侵略战争的人民，都是怀着最愉快最兴奋的心情来庆祝这个胜利的纪念日。
    在纪念签订这样对于世界历史有决定性的国际友好条约的时候，全世界人民，特别是中国人民，对于斯大林大元帅和苏联政府、苏联人民是表示感谢的，同时，对于中国人民领袖毛主席、中国共产党和中央人民政府是同样感谢的。
    我们回想起来，中苏人民的团结能获得今日的成就，不是偶然的事情。
    中苏两国人民的友谊是有了三十多年的历史，从十月革命的时候起，苏联人民始终是以兄弟般的友谊深切地关怀着中国人民的革命事业。光辉的正确的马克思列宁主义指导着中国人民的革命运动；伟大的全世界人民革命导师斯大林大元帅，经常地在理论和行动上对中国人民革命予以实际的帮助。
    在马克思列宁主义的指导下，发挥了伟大的工人阶级国际主义的精神，苏联政府和苏联人民对中国人民的关系，始终是友善的。我们可以从以下的几件重大的历史事实来证明的。
    一九一七年十月革命胜利以后，苏联政府即于十二月自动宣言放弃帝俄时代在我国所享有的一切不正当权益。
    一九一九年苏联政府发表了告中国人民及南方北方政府书，再次申明中苏友好平等问题，对于中国人民脱离帝国主义压迫运动表示援助的热忱和关怀。这个宣言，立即受到了中国工人、农民和青年知识分子的热烈欢迎。直到一九二四年恢复了中苏邦交，签订了完全平等的“中苏北京协定”。
    一九二六年，苏联对于中国革命运动，更给予经济的、政治的、军事的、各方面的具体援助，大力地帮助了北伐进军。在蒋介石劫夺了中国人民革命的果实，背叛了革命以后，于一九二九年七月指使东北军阀军队，发动了可耻的武装进攻苏联的冒险战争，但是，苏联并没有因此而减弱对我国人民革命事业的关怀，这和当时日本帝国主义在我国东北的侵略行动，恰好是一个鲜明的对照。谁是我们的朋友？谁是我们的敌人？在这个事实的面前是容易认识的。
    在抗日战争中，援助中国最早最多最真实的朋友，唯有苏联。抗日战争发生时，苏联首先于一九三七年八月二十一日和中国订立了互不侵犯条约，在精神上和物质上均给以很多的援助。在中国抗日战争最艰苦的日子里，苏联不仅给中国几次无抵押、无报偿的借款，并且在张鼓峰、诺门坎两役打败了敌人，对中国抗战起了很大的影响。待到一九四五年，苏联人民彻底打垮了希特勒匪帮，德寇宣布投降以后，苏联人民为忠实于自己盟国的义务，即于八月九日对日宣战，进军解放东北，迫使日本无条件投降，使中国人民的民族解放战争提早完成了。
    在中国人民的解放战争中，苏联同样是始终同情着和支援着中国人民的。一九四九年，苏联政府和东北人民政府在平等互利的基础上签订了一年贸易协定，具体地帮助了东北的经济发展。
    当中华人民共和国成立以后，苏联政府首先就和我国建立了外交关系，在近两年来，苏联政府的代表，在各种国际会议上，关于中国问题的仗义执言，反对美帝国主义对于中国的侵略和破坏的行动，这说明了苏联人民对于中国人民的友谊是与日俱增深厚无比的。在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订以后，中苏两国就接着订立了各种互利平等的经济贸易协定，对于我国恢复建设工作起了极大的作用。单就帮助中国从事各项建设事业的苏联专家们的事例来说，我们深深地感觉到他们对于中国人民建设事业的努力和热诚的表现，是令我们感谢的，值得
    我们学习的。例如：在我们交通部门工作的苏联专家，他们那种忘我的服务精神，他们那种绝对接受行政领导遵守工作纪律的精神，那种生活朴素艰苦耐劳的工作作风，那种为中国人民少用钱多办事的节约增产的精神，那种钻研技术、利用苏联科学经验、结合中国具体情况的设计施工的工作态度和方针，这一切的表现实在是伟大的。在日常工作中，他们不仅亲自动手，起了带头作用，而且善于团结群众，善于教育群众，也善于向群众学习。对于一般干部毫无保留地传授技术上的知识和技能。苏联政府和苏联人民对于中国人民的这样的真诚帮助，正是苏联人民国际主义精神的一些具体表现。这种大公无私的国际主义的精神，在资本主义国家是不可想像的，而且也是他们所不能理解的。
    从以上这些活生生的事实来看苏联人民对中国人民的友谊，经过了三十多年来的实际考验，我们可以得到一个结论：苏联是我们中国人民的真正朋友。然而，其他一些资本主义的国家呢？
    自满清末年以来，如日本、德国、荷兰、比利时、法国、英国、美国等国家，他们也曾经派出一些所谓学者、教师、专家、工程师来到中国，伪装着中国人民的朋友，但是，他们这些伪善的面孔，就很快地被它们那些盗窃、间谍的行动所揭露了。它们都是奉着资本家主子的命令来进行掠夺、剥削、欺诈的活动，为了找寻商品市场、军事基地，为了变中国为它们的殖民地的目的。
    事实是最好的雄辩者，一切对苏联存有糊涂思想的人们，对帝国主义存有幻想的人们，应该在真理和事实的面前觉醒起来了。
    三十多年来，中苏两国人民的友谊历史，不止说明了苏联人民是我们中国人民的真正朋友，而且是一切被压迫被奴役人民的真正朋友，同时，也说明了中苏两大国人民的友谊，必须在列宁斯大林和毛主席的旗帜下，才能建立起来，巩固起来和向前发展，成为世世代代的永恒的友谊，成为改造世界，改造人类的最可靠的因素。
    在这个有重大意义的纪念日，中国人民由于抗美援朝的战争，能够获得重大胜利，打败了侵朝的美国兽军，制止了美帝国主义扩大战争的疯狂计划的实现，增强了我们的战斗力量，这一系列的事实，更深切地认识了中苏友好同盟互助条约所产生的巨大的作用和影响，也同时更深切地认识了毛主席的英明的科学预见，加强了全国人民对毛主席和中国共产党的信仰。美帝国主义因为要作垂死的挣扎，充当资本主义奴役世界的最后的镖手，它现在正加速地进行勾结日本的反动势力，重新武装日本，占领台湾，扶植蒋匪残余，企图侵略中国，奴役中国人民，这是早经注定的一条死路。两年前中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订正是因为预见了美帝国主义要搞这一套侵略计划，而早为布置的捕捉“纸老虎”的行动。我们全国人民正在全心全意地在毛主席领导下，厉行增产节约运动，继续加强抗美援朝运动，完成土地改革工作，改造各种知识分子，进行轰轰烈烈地反贪污、反行贿运动，并准备一切必需的条件，来展开大规模的经济建设，这一切的一切就是中国人民为纪念并拥护中苏友好同盟互助条约的物质力量。
    我从一九二六年到现在，已经有三次到过伟大的苏联，每一次都得到了苏联友人的热情的招待，对于我的工作和思想认识给予很大的鼓励和帮助，每一次都看到苏联建国的进步，都发现有新的事物可以供我用心学习。其次，我们中国农工民主党，在艰苦奋斗被压迫的时期，也曾获得苏联友人的精神鼓舞和很多的帮助，由于这一切，我感到苏联人民的伟大，苏联人民深厚笃实的友情，我感谢苏联，感谢可敬爱的苏联友人，我要用一切力量来学习苏联，来在毛主席和中国共产党领导下，为中国人民服务，建设我们的国家，实现社会主义共产主义来答谢苏联人民伟大深切的友情。
