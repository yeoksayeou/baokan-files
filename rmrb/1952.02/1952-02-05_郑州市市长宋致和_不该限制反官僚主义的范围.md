    Zhengzhou Mayor Song Zhihe
    Should Not Limit the Scope of Anti-Bureaucracy
    Comrade Editor: At the Zhengzhou People's Representative Conference on January 14th, Zhengzhou Mayor Song Zhihe said: "The anti-bureaucracy struggle in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is not against general bureaucracy, but against bureaucracy that supports or protects corruption and waste, or that causes serious corruption and waste." He said that the representatives should grasp this central point. I feel that this does not conform to the spirit indicated by the Central People's Government. Comrade Bo Yibo, Director of the Central People's Government's Thrift Examination Committee, said at the meeting of cadres from the Central Government, North China, and Beijing and Tianjin: Leaders of various units should not subjectively limit the scope of the mass movement. He also pointed out that it is wrong for leading cadres to only allow the masses to oppose corruption and waste in some units where bureaucracy is clearly the most serious. Comrade Song Zhihe has drawn a scope for anti-bureaucracy, which limits the mass movement. Judging from the specific situation in Zhengzhou, this should not be done. For example, the people of Zhengzhou have the most complaints about the bureaucratic style of the household registration police at the police stations of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Liu Jizeng, a household registration police officer at the 19th Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, usually oppresses the masses, who call him "local emperor," and say he "doesn't negotiate," (meaning he has a serious style of forced orders). However, Liu Jizeng's facts of corruption and waste are not serious. If we do not first oppose Liu Jizeng's style, the masses in that area will not dare to make suggestions (Liu has been removed from his post and investigated, which was done at the request of the representatives).
    On January 15th, I presented the above opinions to Comrade Song Zhihe in writing and orally, but he did not accept them. Judging from the current development of the movement in Zhengzhou, some agencies have limited the scope of anti-bureaucracy because they followed his instructions, which has affected the development of the movement. I think this should be corrected quickly.
    Reporter for Zhengzhou Daily Xu Jin
    Editor's Note: Comrade Xu Jin's opinion is correct. Leaders of various units should not subjectively limit the scope of the mass movement. In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the masses can express opinions on bureaucracy in all aspects and at all levels. However, the central link of this movement at present is to concentrate efforts on pursuing corrupt elements, especially capturing major corrupt officials. Therefore, after the leading cadres at all levels have made profound self-criticisms on the main issues, they should shift the main forces of the leadership and the masses to the struggle to encircle and suppress the major corrupt officials. In places where leading cadres have not made profound self-criticisms, self-criticisms should be made at an appropriate time, but this should not delay the attack on the major corrupt officials.

### 郑州市市长宋致和  不该限制反官僚主义的范围

    郑州市市长宋致和  
    不该限制反官僚主义的范围
    编辑同志：郑州市市长宋致和在一月十四日郑州市各界人民代表会议上说：“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中的反官僚主义斗争，不是反对一般的官僚主义；而是反对支持、包庇贪污、浪费行为，或是因为官僚主义造成严重贪污、浪费行为的官僚主义。”他说，代表们应该抓住这个中心。我觉得这和中央人民政府所指示的精神是不符合的。中央人民政府节约检查委员会薄一波主任在中央、华北和北京、天津两市干部大会上说：各单位的领导同志不应该主观地限制群众运动的范围。并且指出，有些单位明明官僚主义最严重，但领导干部却只许群众反贪污、反浪费是错误的。宋致和同志把反官僚主义划了一个范围，这就限制了群众运动。从郑州市的具体情况来看，也不应该这样作。比如郑州市群众对市公安局派出所户籍警的官僚主义作风意见最多。市公安局十九派出所户籍警刘吉增，平时欺压群众，群众叫他“土皇帝”，“言不二价”，（有严重的强迫命令作风的意思）。但是刘吉增贪污、浪费的事实并不严重，假如不首先反对刘吉增的作风，那一区的群众就不敢提意见（刘已被撤职查办，是在代表们要求下办理的）。
    一月十五日，我把上列意见用书面和口头两种办法向宋致和同志提出，他不接受。从现在郑州市运动的发展情况看，有些机关就因为按照他的指示，限制了反官僚主义的范围，影响了运动的开展。我觉得这是应该迅速纠正的。
    郑州日报记者　徐进
    编者按：徐进同志的意见是对的。各单位的领导同志不应该主观地限制群众运动的范围。在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，群众对各个环节各个方面表现的官僚主义都可以提出意见。但是，现时这个运动的中心一环是集中力量穷追贪污分子，特别是捉捕大贪污犯。因此，各级领导干部在主要问题上做了深刻的检讨之后，就应该把领导和群众的主要力量转到围剿大贪污犯的斗争中去。在领导干部还没有做深刻检讨的地方，应在适当时机补行检讨，但不能因此拖延对于大贪污犯的进攻。
