    Beijing Ruifuxiang Silk and Fabric Store Skimps on Materials
    Municipal Thrift Examination Committee Should Conduct Inspection
    Editor: The Special Transportation Section of the Beijing Railway Bureau ordered sixty new cotton quilts from the "Ruifuxiang" silk and fabric store in Beijing last December. At that time, it was specified that the quilts should be filled with new cotton and have thickened silk net covers (twice as thick as ordinary ones), and the quilt's specifications and dimensions were also stipulated. We mistakenly thought that an old brand like "Ruifuxiang" would not have any problems, so we did not carefully inspect the goods during acceptance. Recently, we inspected goods purchased from private merchants and discovered that, of these sixty cotton quilts, only ten met the specifications. The remaining fifty quilts contained more than 50% old cotton that had been bleached with bleaching powder (we opened all the cotton quilts to check). The net covers were not thickened, and some of the dimensions were even shorter.
    We believe that "Ruifuxiang" Silk and Fabric Store's behavior of skimping on materials and seeking exorbitant profits is intolerable. I suggest that the Beijing Municipal Thrift Examination Committee conduct a thorough inspection of this merchant.

    北京瑞蚨祥绸布店偷工减料
    市节约检查委员会应进行检查
    编辑同志：北京铁路分局专运科去年十二月在北京“瑞蚨祥”绸布店订购了六十条新棉被，当时讲明被中充垫新棉花加厚的丝网套（比普通的厚一倍），并规定了被子的规格尺寸。我们错误地以为像“瑞蚨祥”这样的老字号，一定不会有问题，因而在验收货物时，就没有认真检查。最近我们检查从私商手中购买的货物，才发现这六十条棉被中，除了十条合乎规格外，其余五十条被子的棉花，有百分之五十以上都是用漂白粉漂过的旧棉花（我们把所有的棉被都拆开看了），网套也没有加厚，尺寸有的还短一些。
    我们认为“瑞蚨祥”绸布店这种偷工减料、贪图暴利的行为是令人不能容忍的。我建议北京市节约检查委员会对这个商号进行一次彻底的检查。
