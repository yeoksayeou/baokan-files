Labor Model Shao Bingnan
Offers Rationalization Proposals to Increase Tugboat Speed

Editor: Labor Model Shao Bingnan is a worker on the "Huadong Tugboat 101" belonging to the Huaiyin Shipping Branch of the East China Inland River Shipping Company. Last October, the tugboat was undergoing repairs at the Zhenjiang Inland River Ship Repair Factory. He discovered that the slow speed of the tugboat was due to the engine being one inch too short. He brought this suggestion to the factory's engineers, but they ignored him. He patiently explained the reasons to the engineers. He thought that as a labor model, he should have the spirit to overcome all difficulties. After several discussions, the engineers finally agreed with his suggestion and moved the engine back one inch. The speed of the tugboat increased significantly compared to before. He saw that there were more than 300 discarded screws on the ship and realized that these were all the wealth of the country and should be put to good use. He categorized these nails and used the large ones for larger purposes, the small ones for smaller purposes, and modified and tested the ones that were not suitable. As a result, all 300 discarded screws were utilized. At 10,000 yuan per screw, this saved the country 3 million yuan.

    劳动模范邵炳南
    提合理化建议增加拖轮速度
    编辑同志：劳动模范邵炳南是华东内河轮船公司所属淮阴轮船分公司“华东拖一○一轮”的工人。去年十月，拖轮停在镇江内河船舶修理厂修理。他发现拖轮速度很慢的原因是引擎短了一寸。他把这个意见提给修理厂的工程师，工程师不理他。他还是耐心地把理由解释给工程师听。他想到自己是个劳动模范，应该有排除万难的精神。经过几次商讨，工程师终于同意了他的意见，把引擎排后一寸。拖轮的速度较前大见提高。他看到船上有三百多只废螺丝钉，就想到这些都是国家的财富，应该好好地利用。他把这些钉子分门别类，能大用的就大用，小用的就小用，实在不合用的就修改后试用。结果，三百只废螺丝钉全部被利用了。每只钉以一万元计算，就为国家节省了三百万元。
