Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th – Soviet films are warmly welcomed by the broad masses of people in Northeast China. In the past three years, the total number of viewers has reached over 36 million. The number of viewers has been increasing year by year. In 1949, there were over 2.5 million viewers, which increased to over 11 million in 1950, and then surged to over 22.5 million in 1951. Almost every show is fully occupied whenever a dubbed Soviet film is screened in various places. For example, the film "The Fall of Berlin" had over 2.22 million viewers, including over 320,000 viewers in Shenyang alone.

The people of Northeast China especially love the Sino-Soviet co-productions and films that praise Lenin and Stalin, the teachers of the people of the world. When the film "Lenin in 1918" was shown in Shenyang, many work units, due to their busy schedules, sent representatives to watch it, and then the representatives would convey the content of the film to everyone for study. When the Sino-Soviet co-production "The Victory of the Chinese People" was screened, farmers in the Tiexi District of Shenyang traveled twenty *li* to see it, despite their fatigue from the autumn harvest.

"The Fall of Berlin," "How the Steel Was Tempered," "An Ordinary Soldier," "They Have a Motherland," and other Soviet films that have been screened have all deeply educated the broad masses of viewers in patriotism and internationalism. After watching "The Fall of Berlin," a soldier of the People's Liberation Army in Shenyang wrote in the comment book: "Ivanov in the film is a good example. We must learn from him well in the movement to resist America and aid Korea!" Some farmers in Jilin, after watching the film "Michurin," expressed their urgent desire to learn the scientific methods of cultivating crops in cold climates from the Soviet elder brother. Christians, after watching the film "The Conspiracy," said: "We must actively respond to the call of the People's Government, raise our vigilance, and not be exploited by imperialism."

    东北各地广大人民
    热爱苏联影片
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】苏联影片受到东北各地广大人民的热烈欢迎。三年来观众总数共达三千六百多万人。观众人数是逐年增加的，在一九四九年，观众为二百五十多万人，一九五零年增加到一千一百多万人，一九五一年即激增到二千二百五十多万人。各地每逢上映一部译制的苏联影片时，差不多场场满座。如“攻克柏林”一片的观众即达二百二十二万多人，其中沈阳一地的观众就有三十二万多人。
    东北人民特别喜爱中苏合制片和歌颂世界人民导师列宁、斯大林的影片。“列宁在一九一八”影片在沈阳上演时，很多单位因为工作繁忙，就派代表去看，由代表给大家传达影片的内容，以进行学习。中苏合制影片“中国人民的胜利”上演时，沈阳铁西区农民曾不顾秋收的疲劳，赶了二十里路来看。
    “攻克柏林”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“一个普通的战士”、“他们有祖国”以及其他上演过的苏联影片，都使广大观众受到了深刻的爱国主义和国际主义教育。沈阳市一位解放军战士看完“攻克柏林”影片后，在感想簿上写道：“影片中的伊万诺夫就是好榜样，我们在抗美援朝运动中要好好学习他！”吉林有些农民在看过“米邱林”影片后，表示迫切要求学习苏联老大哥在严寒的气候中培植作物的科学方法。基督教徒们在看了“阴谋”影片后说：“我们要好好响应人民政府的号召，提高警惕，不要被帝国主义所利用。”
