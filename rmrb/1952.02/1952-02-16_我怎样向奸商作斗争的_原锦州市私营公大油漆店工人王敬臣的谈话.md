    How I Fought Against Unscrupulous Merchants
    — A Conversation with Wang Jingchen, Former Worker at the Private Gongda Paint Store in Jinzhou
    My name is Wang Jingchen, and I used to be a worker at the private Gongda Paint Store in Jinzhou, Liaoxi Province. In the spring of 1950, I was introduced by a friend to work as a technician at this paint store. Soon after I arrived, Gongda Paint Store took on a project. The contract clearly stated that black lead oil should be used, but the manager, Jin Yuqing, told the workers to mix soybean juice with black soot and brush it on. Later, he even went so far as to mix in soot from the kang (traditional Chinese bed-stove) tunnels. I knew this was nonsense, and that it would all be ruined after a rain and exposure to the sun. That time, he defrauded the state of more than 200 million yuan. In 1949 and 1950 alone, Jin Yuqing profited at least 700 to 800 million yuan from just two units. At the end of 1950, a certain unit entrusted him to buy lead oil, and he made an illegal profit of more than 230 million yuan. The above are all obvious and undeniable facts; there were many, many others.
    I really couldn't stand Jin Yuqing's cutting corners. Once, I questioned him, and he glared at me, saying, "What! Do you want to make trouble for me?" Then, he threw the cigarette he was holding on the ground and said angrily, "Let me tell you the truth, you can go and sue me anywhere you like!" I knew he had dealings with several cadres, and they were always eating, drinking, gambling, and visiting prostitutes together. They didn't call each other "comrade," but just addressed each other as "brother." I wanted to sue him, but I was afraid of "failing to catch the fox and getting my hands dirty," and some of the workers were still deceived by him. His method of doing bad things was to first drag cadres "into the water," and then to win over a few ideologically backward workers. He often said to the workers, "Brothers, work hard, and I will never treat you unfairly. When the meat is fat, the soup is also rich." In reality, he wouldn't even lend a few dollars to workers whose families couldn't make ends meet.
    He dragged cadres into the water by first offering them cigarettes, movies, then dinners, pens, watches, gambling, and finally dragging them to prostitutes and wild women. As far as I know, there were quite a few cadres from just two organizations who were dragged down by him, including engineers, section chiefs, division chiefs, and clerks. Every Sunday, Jin Yuqing would bring the cadres to the counter to play cards. If the cadres lost, the counter paid; if the cadres won, they took the money. Some apprentices asked Jin Yuqing why he did this. He replied, "This money is spent wisely; otherwise, how could these money-carrying mules (referring to the cadres) listen!"
    Since that quarrel with Jin Yuqing, I had made up my mind: I would leave sooner or later. However, the workers were not united, and more importantly, Jin Yuqing's dark secrets had not been fully uncovered. I decided to be patient for the time being, and encourage the workers to join the trade union, so that everyone could be educated and make progress, before dealing with him. Jin Yuqing was against the workers joining the trade union. He told the workers, "When you join the trade union, you can't put Gongda Paint Store as your service address!" The implication was "whoever joins the trade union can pack up and leave." In addition, he secretly spread undermining rumors: "Joining the trade union is useless!" Thanks to the active support of the leading organization and everyone's enthusiasm, his tricks didn't work. Later, he didn't give up. When the trade union notified the workers to attend meetings or classes, he would withhold the notices and issue theater tickets for the workers to go to the movies.
    In the spring of 1951, both public and private enterprises raised wages, but Gongda Paint Store was the only one that didn't comply. Because of this, I took the lead in negotiating with Jin Yuqing. He said with a grin, "Brother, let's not beat around the bush. If you need anything, just take it from the counter. Starting next month, I'll give you 600,000 yuan (Northeast currency) extra, don't make a fuss with them." I said, "I can't accept such a thing! Everyone should get a raise." He saw that I was stern and not being polite to him, and he got angry: "I didn't expect you to be so unappreciative. Well, from this month onwards, I'll give all the workers at the counter a raise! You? I'll postpone it!" When I heard this, it was like someone defecating on my neck. He must have thought I was "dead set on this tree." In fact, he was wrong! I immediately asked him, "Do you mean what you say?" He put on a self-satisfied look and said, "Of course!" I turned and left Gongda Paint Store.
    Leaving Gongda Paint Store, I felt very happy: firstly, the workers' wage problem had been solved; secondly, I had gathered almost all the information I needed. The next day, I went to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and reported the matter in detail to Comrade Zhao Yulin, the chairman of the trade union. He introduced me to the Labor Bureau to work in the construction engineering team. A few days later, I joined forces with the workers of Gongda Paint Store to sue Jin Yuqing, and the government arrested him. Unexpectedly, the capitalists came up with a new trick.
    After Jin Yuqing was arrested, Fan Gongfu, the deputy manager of Gongda Paint Store, started to become active. He knew that I had led the charge in suing Jin Yuqing, so he first fired blank shots to intimidate the workers at the counter: "Money can make the devil turn the millstone. Manager Jin will definitely be back in less than half a month!" Who knew that after waiting for more than a month, there was no news. Fan Gongfu got anxious, thought of ideas, came up with bad plans, and tried to bribe the workers at the counter to overturn the case. I don't remember which day it was, but I went to Gongda Paint Store to find out the situation. Technician Ye Chunlin advised me: "Old Wang, let it go! Killing people only gets your hands bloody, why bother?" When I heard this, I knew something was wrong. After asking around, many workers also said: "Killing is just a matter of losing your head, just 'smooth things over'!" Without saying a word, I ran to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and discussed it with Comrade Zhao Yulin. He said: "Don't worry, find a way to unite the workers, and see what kind of medicine the capitalists are selling in their gourds!" When I heard this, I immediately understood.
    The next morning, I went to Gongda Paint Store to find technician Xie Yuhai. He was relatively close to the manager. I deliberately said: "I was just temporarily hot-headed, in fact, Manager Jin and I have 'no old grudges, no recent hatreds'." These words were very effective. A day later, Fan Gongfu (deputy manager) sent an apprentice to find me and invited me to a restaurant. At the restaurant, he said to me: "Brother, please do it for my sake, and find a way to withdraw this case. When Manager Jin comes out, I'll give you a small ingot (gold ingot), a single *kua* (gold bracelet); or, I'll give you a share. From now on, don't work in the engineering team anymore, if you have any difficulties, just tell your brother. If you don't believe me, I'll give you an IOU right away. I can swear to God: I have two wives and only one son. If I don't keep my word, my son will die on the first day of the New Year!" After saying that, he handed me a stack of bills (400,000 yuan) and said: "Take this little bit of money to spend." At that time, I was both angry and amused, and asked him: "What do you want me to do?" He grinned and said: "Turn big into small, and small into nothing! If it really can't be resolved, then put it on the workers. For example, the oil painting thing, just say that the manager didn't know, it was purely the workers messing around." I said: "Can the workers accept that?" He showed a smug expression and said: "Brother, I have a clever plan. I have already agreed with Xie Yuhai on this matter, and he is willing to admit it. I have already promised to give him half a share, and in the future – haha, a knowing look." When I heard this, how poisonous! I really wanted to slap him twice. But I thought, for the sake of work, I'll wait until the truth comes out. After eating (this meal cost more than 500,000), I returned to Gongda Paint Store with him. When I saw the workers at the counter, and told them about it, they all told the truth: This one said: "I plotted for 400,000 yuan!" That one said: "I got 500,000!" That afternoon, I went to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to report to Chairman Zhao. He said: "Investigate clearly, report to the court immediately, and use this to educate all the workers." A few days later, the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy was launched. At the mobilization and exposure meeting, I exposed these ugly things of the capitalists on the spot. When the worker Xie Yuhai heard this, he cried out loud. He said: "Jin Yuqing is really not raised by his parents, he wants me to be a scapegoat!"
    Now the court has also arrested Fan Gongfu. I don't want to say more, please think about it, and judge, who is harming the country and the people? Who is harming others and benefiting themselves? Who is only interested in profit? Who is attacking the revolutionary camp?

    我怎样向奸商作斗争的
    ——原锦州市私营公大油漆店工人王敬臣的谈话
    我原是辽西省锦州市私营公大油漆店的工人，名叫王敬臣。一九五○年春，经朋友介绍，我到这个漆店当技工。一来就赶上公大油漆店包活。合同上明明写着使用黑铅油，经理金玉青却叫工友用豆汁搅黑烟子往上刷；后来更索性往里掺炕洞子里的烟灰。我知道这是胡闹，将来一着雨，被太阳一晒，就会通统完蛋。那一回他就骗了国家两亿多元。在一九四九年和一九五○年，仅两个单位，至少让金玉青吃了七、八亿元。一九五○年末，某单位托他买铅油，他从中渔利两亿三千多万元。以上都是明摆着的无法掩盖的事，其他还有很多很多。
    金玉青偷工减料，我实在看不惯。有一回我质问他，他两眼一竖：“干嘛！你想跟我过不去？”接着把衔着的纸烟往地下一扔，气汹汹地说：“老实告诉你，随你到那里去告！”我知道他和几个干部有来往，到一块不是吃吃喝喝，就是赌博、逛窑子。他们见面都不叫同志，净是你兄我弟的称呼。我有心告他，恐怕“打不着狐狸白弄一手骚”，而且有些工友也还被他迷惑着。他干坏事的手段是一手拉干部“下水”；一手抓少数思想落后的工友。他常向工友讲：“老弟，好好干，我绝不会亏待你。咱们是肉肥汤也肥。”其实有的工友家里揭不开锅，预借几个钱，他都不答应。
    他拖干部下水，先是请吸烟，看电影，然后请吃饭，送钢笔，送手表，打牌，最后拖着干部逛窑子、找野妓。据我知道的，光两机关被他拖下水的干部就有不少，其中包括工程师、科长、股长和办事员。每逢星期日，金玉青就把干部拉到柜上打牌。干部输了，柜上掏钱，干部赢了，拿着走。有的学徒工问金玉青为啥这样做？他这样回答：“这钱是化在刀刃上的，不然，这些驮钱骡（指干部）怎能听说！”
    自从那次跟金玉青吵架以后，我就打了主意：迟早非拔腿不可。但是，眼前工友心不齐，更重要的是金玉青的黑幕还没有完全弄清。我决定暂时忍耐一下，动员工友加入工会，让大家受点教育，都进步了，再跟他干。金玉青可反对工友加入工会。他向工友们讲：“你们入工会，填服务地址可不能填公大油漆店！”言外之意是“谁入工会谁卷铺盖”。另外，他还背地里讲破坏话：“入工会顶个屁！”由于领导机关积极支持，大伙张罗得欢，他的手段没使成。后来，他还不死心，工会通知工友们开会或上课，他就把通知押起来，发戏票叫工友去看戏。
    一九五一年春，公私企业都提高工资，唯独公大油漆店没有照办。为这，我出头向金玉青办交涉。他嘻皮笑脸地讲：“老弟，咱俩近人不说远话，有啥用项，尽管由柜上支。由下月起，给你个人加六十万元（东北币），别跟他们瞎哄哄。”我说：“我不能缺这份德！要涨大家涨。”他看我绷着脸，跟他不客气，就火了：“没想到你这个人不识抬举，没别的，从这月份起，我给柜上的工友都加钱！你吗？往后推一推！”我一听，这简直是骑着人的脖子拉屎。他一定揣摩我“离开这村没这店，非这棵树吊不死”。其实，他算错了！我立即问他：“你说这话可算话？”他耍着自鸣得意的样子说：“那自然囉！”我甩手离开了公大油漆店。
    离开公大油漆店，我心里非常痛快：一是工友的工资问题得到解决了；二是我需要了解的材料也差不多了。第二天，我到了市总工会，把这事源源本本地报告给工会主席赵玉林同志。他介绍我到劳动局参加建设工程队工作。没过几天，我联合了公大油漆店的工友把金玉青告了，政府把他逮捕了起来。不料，资本家的新花招又出来了。
    金玉青被捕以后，公大油漆店副经理范公辅接着活动起来。他知道告金玉青是我领头干的，就先放空炮威吓柜上的工友：“有钱能使鬼推磨，金经理不消半月准能回来！”那知等了一个多月，杳无音信。范公辅毛了，想主意，出坏点，想拿钱收买柜上的工友，企图翻案。记不清是那一天，我为了解情况去公大油漆店。技工叶春林劝我说：“老王，算了吧！杀人白弄两手血，何苦来？”我一听这话，知道不妙。再一打听，不少工友也说：“杀人不过头点地，‘圆下脸’就得了呗！”我二话没说，就跑到市总工会和赵玉林同志商量。他说：“你别着急，设法团结工友，到底看看资方葫芦里装的什么药！”我一听，心里立刻亮堂了。
    第二天清早，我便到公大油漆店找技工谢玉海。他和经理是比较靠近的。我故意说：“我只不过一时肝火旺盛，其实，我和金经理是‘往日无冤，近日无仇’。”这话真灵验，隔了一天，范公辅（副经理）就打发徒工找我，邀我去下饭馆。在饭馆里，他对我说：“老弟，一切都看在我的脸上，想法把这一案撤消了。等金经理出来，我给你一个小宝（金锭），一个单銙（金镯子）；再不，送你一个股。往后你也别在工程队干了，有啥困难，尽管给哥哥说。你要不信，我马上打个借条给你。我可以对天起誓：我有两个老婆，还只有一个儿子。若是说了不算，我儿子死在大年初一！”说完话，顺手掏了一叠票子（四十万元）给了我，说：“先拿这点钱零花。”当时我又好气又好笑，就问他：“依你说怎么办好？”他眦牙一笑，说：“大化小，小化了呗！实在化不了的就给工人搁上。比方刷油那桩事，就说经理不知道，纯是工人们胡搞的。”我说：“那样工人能受吗？”他露出一幅得意神情说：“老弟，哥哥自有锦囊妙计。这事我已和谢玉海说妥，他愿意承认。我已经答应给他半个股，将来嘛——哈哈，心照不宣。”我一听，好毒！当时真想揍他两个耳光。又一想，为了工作，等水落石出再说。吃罢饭（这顿饭花了五十多万），我同他回到公大油漆店。见了柜上的工友，我和他们一讲，他们都说了实话：这个说：“我图了四十万块钱！”那个说：“我得了五十万！”当天下午，我去市总工会向赵主席汇报了。他说：“调查明白，即刻报告法院，并用这事教育全体工友。”没过几天，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开了，在动员检举会上，我当场揭发了资本家的这些丑事。工友谢玉海一听，哇地一声哭了。他说：“金玉青真不是父母养的，叫我当替死鬼！”
    现在法院已经把范公辅也逮捕起来了。我不愿再多说，请大家想一想，评一评，是谁祸国殃民？是谁损人利己？是谁唯利是图？是谁进攻革命阵营？
