    Immortal Internationalist Fighter
    By Xinhua News Agency Reporter Dai Huang
    On the southern slope of a certain village in northern Korea, there is a newly built tomb. For a month, every soldier and civilian passing by this tomb has approached the tomb with reverence, to pay tribute to this Chinese hero buried on Korean soil – Comrade Luo Shengjiao, a clerk of the reconnaissance team of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army.
    On January 2 this year, after morning exercises, Luo Shengjiao walked towards the river. At this time, four Korean children were happily skating on the river surface. A boy named Cui Ying suddenly slipped towards a thin part of the ice, and immediately broke through the ice and fell into a hole more than eight feet deep; the other three children were so frightened that they cried out. Luo Shengjiao looked up, saw someone had fallen into the water, and hurried to run there. He took off his cotton coat as he ran, stripping down to only his single layer of clothing, and immediately bravely jumped into the ice hole to rescue the Korean boy. In the severe cold of minus twenty degrees Celsius, he was completely immersed in the water and searched twice without finding Cui Ying. He put his head out of the water and quickly took a breath, then plunged into the water again, and found Cui Ying on the third try. He lifted Cui Ying to the surface several times, but because the ice around the ice hole was too thin, each time Cui Ying was about to climb up, the ice would collapse and Cui Ying would fall into the water again. At this time, Luo Shengjiao's blood was about to freeze, his whole body turned purple, his face was pale, and he was already exhausted; but determined to rescue this Korean boy, he once again took a deep breath, sank into the water, stepped on the gravel at the bottom of the river, and did his best to use his head to push Cui Ying out of the water. At this time, the barber from the company headquarters arrived with a telephone pole, and Cui Ying grabbed the pole and was rescued. However, Comrade Luo Shengjiao, who sacrificed himself to save others, never resurfaced and was swept by the rapid current to the ice layer further away. The barber, who couldn't swim, ran back quickly to call for help. By the time people arrived and cut open the ice layer with knives and axes to pull him up, Luo Shengjiao had already stopped breathing.
    This great 21-year-old internationalist fighter was the son of a poor peasant from Malongyou Village, Xiangzi District, Xinhua County, Hunan. He was an excellent member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and a brave soldier in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. In his diary, he had written the following short poem: "When I am hit by the bullets of the invaders, I hope you will not stop in front of my body, but should continue to advance bravely, to avenge the millions of Korean people and the sacrificed comrades!"
    After Luo Shengjiao's sacrifice, more than twenty Korean villagers from a certain village came and surrounded the martyr's body, weeping as if they had lost a loved one. The rescued Korean boy, Cui Ying, cried even more, saying, "Comrade Luo sacrificed himself to save me, he is even closer than my own brother, I want to personally bury him." His mother said, "Comrade Luo sacrificed himself to save Cui Ying, this kindness can never be repaid!" An old woman from the village, named Yuan Shannv, 55 years old, voluntarily offered a piece of burial land to bury our martyr. This piece of land was what she had prepared for her own burial after death. She said to the secretary of the labor party branch in the village, "I will give this good land of mine to Comrade Luo, what is the difference between giving it to him and giving it to my own son? Please tell the Volunteer Army comrades!" That afternoon, villagers flocked to the entrance of the troops' residence, repeatedly begging the captain and political instructor, saying, "Comrade Luo sacrificed himself to save our child, please hand over his remains to us so that we can bury him according to the most solemn funeral of the Korean people!" Their earnest request was finally accepted by the leading organs of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The village children carried Luo Shengjiao's body wrapped in white cloth, and all the men, women, and children of the village followed behind, all with their heads lowered and wiping away tears, walking towards the burial ground. When Luo Shengjiao's body was placed in the tomb pit, the villagers once again surrounded the tomb pit, for one last look at the face of their loved one, and then everyone cried loudly, burying the martyr with a shovelful of soil and a tear. The rescued boy, Cui Ying, led his two younger brothers and three younger sisters, and carried a stone table top three feet long, one foot wide, and five inches thick, placing it in front of the martyr's tomb. Two young women moved two small pine trees from the mountain and planted them on either side of the martyr's tomb. Cui Ying placed a bottle of wine, a bowl of rice, and a bowl of tofu, Korean sacrificial offerings of high respect, on the stone table, and he knelt in front of the martyr's tomb for more than thirty minutes. He swore to the deceased through sobs, "Comrade Luo: I will never forget your life-saving grace, we will commemorate you for generations to come. I am already eighteen years old, I am determined to join the People's Army, inherit your legacy, learn from your spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, and join the Volunteer Army comrades to defeat the American aggressors!" To mourn Luo Shengjiao, the villagers held several meetings in a row. At the meetings, they guaranteed to pay public grain early, and that they would cultivate deeply and meticulously in the future, produce more grain, support the front lines, and strive for greater victories in the anti-aggression war.
    A few days later, the villagers went to Luo Shengjiao's tomb in groups again. They erected a tombstone more than five feet high in front of Luo Shengjiao's tomb. On the back of the tombstone, it was written in Korean: "...The people who live on the land of Korea should always remember our friend Comrade Luo Shengjiao and learn from his great internationalist spirit."

    不朽的国际主义战士
    新华社记者　戴煌
    在朝鲜北部某村的南山坡上，有一座新建的坟墓。一个月以来，凡是在这座墓前经过的军人和人民，都怀着崇敬的心情走上墓基，来凭吊这位埋葬在朝鲜土地上的中国英雄——中国人民志愿军某部侦察队文书罗盛教同志。
    今年一月二日，部队早操过后，罗盛教向河边走去。这时，河面上有四个朝鲜少年正在快乐地滑冰。有一个名叫崔?的少年忽然失足向冰薄的地方滑去，一下子压碎冰面，跌入八尺多深的冰窟窿里去了；另外三个少年吓得哭叫起来。罗盛教抬头一看，见到有人落水了，他便赶忙向那里跑去。他边跑边脱棉衣，全身脱得只剩下一身单衣，立刻奋勇跳进冰窟窿去营救这个朝鲜少年。在零下二十度的严寒里，他全身浸在水中一连探摸了两次没找到崔?。他把头露出水面急忙换了一口气，又钻进水里，第三次才找到了崔?。他几次把崔?托到水面上来，可是因为冰窟窿四边的冰太薄了，每次崔?刚要爬上来，冰块便塌了，崔?又掉入水中。这时，罗盛教身上的血液快冻结了，全身发紫，面色苍白，已经精疲力尽；但他为了决心把这朝鲜少年救出来，就又一次深深地吸了一口气，沉入水中，双脚踏着河底的碎石，竭尽全力用自己的头将崔?顶出水面。这时候连部的理发员拿着一根电线杆子赶到了，崔?抱住杆子才被救上来。但是，舍己救人的罗盛教同志却再也没有浮出水面，就被急流冲到远处的冰层下面去了。不会泅水的理发员飞快跑回去叫人来营救，等人们赶来用刀斧砍开冰层，将他捞上来的时候，罗盛教已经停止了呼吸。
    这位伟大的二十一岁的国际主义战士，是湖南新化县十三区相子村马龙呦一个贫农的儿子。他是中国新民主主义青年团的一个优秀的团员，是中国人民志愿军中的一个勇敢的战士。在他遗留下来的日记本子上，他曾经写了下面的短诗：“当我被侵略者的子弹打中以后，希望你不要在我的尸体面前停留，应该继续勇敢前进，为千万朝鲜人民和牺牲的同志报仇！”
    罗盛教牺牲以后，某村的二十多户朝鲜老乡赶来围在烈士的身旁，像丧失了亲人一样地痛哭着。被营救再生的朝鲜少年崔?更痛哭不止，他说：“罗同志舍身救了我，比我的亲哥哥还要亲，我要亲自去安葬他。”他的母亲说：“罗同志为救崔?而牺牲了自己，这种恩情永远报不尽啊！”该村五十五岁的名叫元善女的老太太自动献出一块茔地来埋葬我们的烈士。这块茔地是她准备在自己死后埋葬用的。她对本村的劳动党支部书记说：“我把自己的这块好地让给罗同志，这比让给自己的儿子有什么分别呢？请你向志愿军同志说说吧！”当天下午，老乡们川流不息地跑到部队住房的门口，再三请求队长和政治指导员说：“罗同志为了救我们的孩子而牺牲了，请你们把他的遗体交给我们按照朝鲜人民的最隆重的葬礼安葬他吧！”他们的恳切要求终于被中国人民志愿军某部领导机关所接受了。村中的少年们抬着用白布缠着的罗盛教的遗体，全村的男女老少都跟在后面，所有的人都低着头擦着眼泪，向茔地走去。当罗盛教的遗体被放进墓坑的时候，村民们再一次围绕在墓坑旁边，最后一次瞻仰亲人的遗容，然后所有的人大哭着，一锹土一把泪地埋葬了烈士。被营救的少年崔?领着他的两个弟弟和三个小妹妹，抬来了一块三尺长、一尺宽、五寸厚的石桌桌面，将它安置在烈士墓前。又有两位姑娘从山上移来两棵小松树，栽在烈士墓的两旁。崔?将朝鲜尊贵的祭礼一瓶酒、一碗饭和一碗豆腐摆在石桌上，他在烈士墓前跪了三十多分钟。他痛哭失声地向死者宣誓：“罗同志：我永远忘不了你的救命恩情，我们要世世代代地纪念着你。我已经十八岁了，我决心参加人民军，继承你的遗志，学习你的全心全意为人民服务的精神，和志愿军同志一起去打败美国侵略者！”为了追悼罗盛教，村民们一连开了好几次会议。他们在会上保证提早缴纳公粮，今后要深耕细作，多打粮食，支援前线，争取在反侵略战争中获得更大的胜利。
    几天以后，村中的人们又成群结队地到罗烈士的墓地上去。他们在罗盛教的墓前竖起了一块出土五尺多高的墓碑，墓碑的背面用朝鲜文写着：“……生长在朝鲜土地上的人民，都应该永远地牢记着我们的友人罗盛教同志，学习他的伟大的国际主义精神。”
