Xinhua News Agency, January 1st: Beijing held a public trial of major embezzlers at 11:00 AM today in the Sun Yat-sen Park Concert Hall. The Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government specially organized a temporary court to publicly try major embezzlers Xue Kunshan, Song Degui, Lei Yaqing, Sun Jianguo, Wang Piye, Xia Maoru, and Hang Xiaozu, and pronounced judgments on the spot, carrying them out separately.
　　Among those who attended the public trial were leaders and activists from central and North China level government agencies, military agencies, Party agencies, and mass organizations. Major embezzlers and suspected major embezzlers from various agencies and organizations also attended the meeting. Citizens from factories, agencies, schools, organizations, shops, and all walks of life in Beijing and Tianjin also listened to the live broadcast of the meeting in an organized manner. Liu Jingfan, Secretary-General of the Central Committee for Economy and Inspection, served as the chairman of the meeting. When Liu Jingfan announced the opening of the meeting, he first explained the major political significance of this meeting in deeply developing the struggle against major embezzlers in central agencies. He pointed out: "The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in the central departments, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, is developing healthily and is now entering a stage of universal and in-depth development. Bureaucracy and extravagance in various departments have been strictly criticized, and efforts are now being concentrated on fighting major embezzlers, with considerable success." Liu Jingfan then used concrete facts to explain the large and small embezzlers who have been exposed and confessed in the central-level organs, as well as the funds they embezzled and the serious losses caused to state property due to embezzlement. He pointed out that the People's Government's punishment of embezzlers is serious and will be handled differently according to the severity of the embezzlement and the degree of confession. He said: "Today, we are publicly trying major embezzlers Xue Kunshan, Song Degui, Lei Yaqing, Sun Jianguo, Wang Piye, Xia Maoru, and Hang Xiaozu based on these policies." Liu Jingfan finally warned all embezzlers: "In order to give the embezzlers another chance to repent and confess, the Central People's Government's Committee for Economy and Inspection has decided to extend the deadline for confession to February 15th. All embezzlers should consider their future, seize the time, and honestly confess their guilt to the people. Those who thoroughly confess before February 15th will still be treated as voluntary confessors."
　　After the chairman's speech, the temporary court, presided over by Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court, announced the opening of the court. Seven major embezzlers were escorted into the venue by people's police and stood before the angry masses to listen to the accusations from representatives of relevant units and the judgment of the court.
　　Yao Yilin, Vice Minister of the Central Trade Department, Luo Ruiqing, Minister of the Central Public Security Department, Zhang Linchi, Vice Minister of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, Yang Tian, representative of the General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission, Bai Yun, representative of the Air Force Headquarters, Wu Bo, representative of the Central People's Government Ministry of Finance, and Tang Kai, Deputy Director of the Civil Aviation Administration, successively accused the major embezzlers Xue Kunshan, Song Degui, Lei Yaqing, Sun Jianguo, Wang Piye, Xia Maoru, and Hang Xiaozu of their crimes at the meeting. The major embezzler Xue Kunshan was originally a fur merchant from Zhangjiakou with only 200 bolts of cloth as capital. When Zhangjiakou was first liberated in 1945, Xue took the opportunity to infiltrate our national trade agencies. In April 1951, he even usurped the important position of Deputy Director of the Business Department of the China Animal Products Company, using his authority to steal national economic intelligence to serve his 19 business firms. It has now been verified that the illegal property obtained by Xue exceeded 2.3 billion yuan. The major embezzler Song Degui, formerly Director of the Administrative Office of the Central Public Security Department, abused his authority and violated laws and regulations, colluding with unscrupulous merchants to steal a large amount of state property, amounting to more than 900 million yuan. Song embezzled 640 million yuan for himself and stubbornly refused to confess, colluding with unscrupulous merchants to undermine the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. The major embezzler Lei Yaqing, formerly Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Supply Station of the State-owned Farm of the Central Ministry of Agriculture, used his authority to collude with unscrupulous merchants to steal state property amounting to more than 400 million yuan. Lei embezzled and accepted bribes of 147 million yuan and still refused to confess thoroughly after being discovered. The major embezzler Sun Jianguo, formerly Deputy Director of the Supply Department of the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission, was induced by unscrupulous merchants to engage in smuggling and embezzled and accepted bribes of 127 million yuan. He also introduced unscrupulous merchants into the state production agencies, causing significant losses to state property. During this movement, he completely and voluntarily confessed thoroughly and exposed the relevant unscrupulous merchants. The major embezzler Wang Piye, formerly an engineer in the Barracks Management Department of the Air Force Logistics Department, used his authority to collude with unscrupulous merchants to steal state property, personally embezzling and accepting bribes of 252.75 million yuan. He was forced to confess only after his crimes were exposed, but his confession was relatively thorough, and he exposed the major case of the unscrupulous merchant Liu Yuanjing and others sabotaging national defense construction by stealing more than 8 billion yuan of state property. The major embezzler Xia Maoru, an engineer and Chief of the Engineering Section of the Central South District Grain Administration Bureau, used his authority to collude with unscrupulous merchants to embezzle and accept bribes of more than 120 million yuan. After the start of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he voluntarily confessed his guilt and actively exposed several other embezzlement cases. The major embezzler Hang Xiaozu, Chief Engineer and Director of the Telecommunications Factory of the Civil Aviation Administration, embezzled 17,500 Hong Kong dollars and a steel wire recorder of employee salaries during the uprising of employees of the pseudo "Central Aviation Corporation." He initially reviewed his actions during the rectification movement in 1951. During this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he thoroughly confessed his guilt, guaranteed to return all the stolen money to the state, and made some contributions to the state in technical improvement and invention within the past year while serving with guilt.
　　After the accusations against the major embezzlers, Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court and Chief Judge of the Temporary Court, announced the judgment: The major embezzler Xue Kunshan was sentenced to death, and all his property was confiscated; other defendants in the same case will be tried separately. The major embezzler Song Degui was sentenced to death, and all his property was confiscated; other defendants in the same case will be tried separately. The major embezzler Lei Yaqing was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment, and all his embezzled money was recovered; other defendants in the same case will be tried separately. The major embezzler Sun Jianguo was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, with a reprieve for observation, and all his embezzled money was recovered; other defendants in the same case will be tried separately. The major embezzler Wang Piye was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, with a reprieve for observation, and all his embezzled money was recovered; other defendants in the same case will be tried separately. The major embezzler Xia Maoru was exempted from criminal punishment; the embezzled and bribery money, except for what has been returned, should be recovered, and the competent authority should give him administrative punishment; other defendants in the same case will be tried separately. The major embezzler Hang Xiaozu was exempted from criminal punishment and will be given administrative punishment by the competent authority. After the sentencing, Xue Kunshan and Song Degui were immediately escorted away from the venue for execution, and Lei Yaqing, Sun Jianguo, and Wang Piye were immediately escorted to the court to serve their sentences or reprieves. Xia Maoru and Hang Xiaozu returned to the ranks of their respective agencies on the spot. At this time, applause resounded throughout the venue, shouting slogans such as "Support the People's Government and severely punish embezzlers who refuse to confess!" "The people of the whole country unite and resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attack!" "The people of the whole country take active action to expose embezzlers!" "Embezzlers only have a way out if they thoroughly confess!"
　　Finally, Bo Yibo, Director of the Central Committee for Economy and Inspection, made a report to the conference.
　　During the conference, the broad masses of people in Beijing who listened to the live recording of the conference also called the conference one after another, resolutely supporting the fair judgment of the temporary court of the Supreme People's Court on the major embezzlers. More than 600 employees of the North China Agricultural Science Institute said to the presidium of the conference on the phone: "After our institute heard the conference announce the execution of major embezzlers Xue Kunshan and Song Degui, all comrades raised their hands to support the government's correct judgment. We will follow the fighting spirit of the conference and relentlessly pursue the major embezzlers until complete victory is achieved."
