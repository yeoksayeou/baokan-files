    [Report from our newspaper] The U.S. aggressor troops' towering crime of spreading bacteria in the Korean front lines and rear areas has aroused boundless indignation among people from all walks of life in the capital. Many factories, schools, organizations, and groups have held emergency meetings, unanimously expressing their determination to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army with practical actions, thoroughly smash the towering crimes of U.S. imperialism, and strive for the final victory in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. The entire membership of the Trade Union of Chinese Textile Workers National Committee, in their letter to this newspaper, pointed out: "U.S. imperialism's inhuman bacteriological warfare, attempting to massacre on a large scale peaceful Korean residents and the Chinese and Korean people's forces, must be subjected to the righteous condemnation and the most severe sanctions of peace-loving people all over the world. Japanese fascists once used bacteriological weapons to massacre the Chinese people; but it was precisely these Japanese fascist bandits who were destroyed. Today, U.S. imperialism has inherited the mantle of the German and Japanese fascists, brutally using bacteriological weapons. This will not only fail to save it from defeat in Korea, but will accelerate its demise. We must thoroughly carry out the anti-corruption movement, further increase production and practice economy, create greater material strength for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and strike a heavier blow against the U.S. aggressors." Reader Chen Buxiang said: "When our post office employees saw the enemy's crazy and brutal crimes, everyone gnashed their teeth and was extremely angry. Unable to withstand the severe blows of the heroic Chinese and Korean troops, the enemy resorted to such brutal and vicious means. We must not tolerate such towering crimes against human justice and international law committed by the U.S. aggressor troops. We must, together with the people of the world, impose the most severe sanctions on the heinous enemy." A letter from all the students of Yenching University said: "Ironclad facts have proven that the purpose of U.S. imperialism in obstructing and delaying negotiations in every possible way is to prepare to expand the war of aggression against Korea by means of inhumane methods, vainly attempting to save their irretrievable military defeat. In fact, this can never be salvaged. We are ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, go to the forefront of the battle, and contribute all our strength to repel all attacks of U.S. imperialism."
    The readers of this newspaper unanimously emphasized in their letters: This heinous crime of the U.S. aggressor troops has completely exposed the ugly and hideous face of U.S. imperialism. Zheng Yang, an overseas Chinese student at Peking University, said: "This fact fully proves that the U.S. aggressor troops are the most brutal, the most insane, and the most inhumane army in the world." Reader Jia Huizheng said: "Our medical experts are studying how to eliminate diseases so that humans can live healthily; but the medical experts of U.S. imperialism are studying how to create diseases to accelerate the death of humans."

    侵朝美军灭绝人性使用细菌作战的罪行
    激起首都各界人民无限愤怒
    【本报讯】侵朝美军在朝鲜前线和后方撒布细菌的滔天罪行，激起了首都各界人民的无限愤怒。许多工厂、学校、机关、团体都召开了紧急会议，一致表示要以实际行动支援中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军，彻底粉碎美帝国主义的滔天罪行，争取抗美援朝战争的最后胜利。中国纺织工会全国委员会机关工会全体会员在写给本报的信中指出：“美帝国主义灭绝人性进行细菌战争，妄图大规模屠杀朝鲜和平居民和中朝人民部队，一定要受到全世界爱好和平人民的正义斥责和最严厉的制裁。日本法西斯曾以细菌武器屠杀中国人民；但是毁灭的正是日本法西斯的匪徒们。今天美帝国主义又继承了德、日法西斯的衣钵，残暴地使用细菌武器。这不仅不能挽救它在朝鲜的失败，相反的必将加速它的灭亡。我们一定要彻底搞好反贪污运动，进一步增产节约，为抗美援朝创造更大的物质力量，更沉重地打击美国侵略者。”读者陈步湘说：“我们邮局职工看到敌人这种疯狂、残暴的罪行，个个咬牙切齿，愤怒已极。敌人挡不住英勇的中朝部队的严重打击，就使出了这种残暴恶毒的手段。对于美国侵略军这种违反人类正义和国际公法的滔天罪行，我们决不能容忍。我们要和全世界人民一起，给予万恶的敌人以最严厉的制裁。”燕京大学全体同学的来信中说：“铁一般的事实已经证明了：美帝国主义百般阻挠和拖延谈判的目的，就是为了准备以灭绝人性的手段来扩大侵朝战争，妄想挽救他们无法挽救的军事上的惨败。事实上，这是永远也挽救不了的。我们准备随时响应祖国的号召，到战斗的最前线去，贡献我们的一切力量，打退美帝国主义的一切进攻。”
    本报读者在来信中一致强调指出：侵朝美军的这一万恶罪行，彻底暴露了美帝国主义丑恶狰狞的面貌。北京大学华侨学生郑扬说：“这一事实完全证明了，美国侵略军是世界上最残暴、最疯狂和最无人性的军队。”读者贾惠铮说：“我们的医学专家们，在研究如何消灭疾病，使人类能够健康地生活着；但是美帝国主义的医学专家们，却在研究如何制造疾病，使人类加速死亡。”
