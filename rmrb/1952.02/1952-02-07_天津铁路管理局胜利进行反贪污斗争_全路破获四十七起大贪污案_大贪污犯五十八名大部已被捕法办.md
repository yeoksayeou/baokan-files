    [This Dispatch] Tianjin Railway Administration Victoriously Carries Out the Anti-Corruption Struggle; The Entire Railway System Uncovers Forty-Seven Major Corruption Cases; Fifty-Eight Major Corrupt Officials Have Been Mostly Arrested and Brought to Justice
    [From Our Newspaper] Since the Spring Festival, under the leadership of the CCP Railway Committee, all employees of the Tianjin Railway Administration have concentrated their efforts on encircling and suppressing major corrupt officials, pushing the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement to a new high, and have achieved great victories. As of February 4th, the entire railway system has uncovered forty-seven major corruption cases involving over 100 million yuan, involving a total of fifty-eight major corrupt officials. Most of them have been arrested and brought to justice for refusing to confess. In addition to urging the remaining major corrupt officials to confess and repent, their crimes are being thoroughly investigated. This victory of the Tianjin Railway Administration is a powerful counterattack against the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie on the people's railway enterprises over the past three years.
    The major corrupt officials arrested by the Tianjin Railway Administration have generally stolen state assets in the following ways:
    (1) Blatantly stealing huge amounts of state assets. For example, Wang Qiyu, an engineer at the Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory and a major corrupt official (a retained employee, later transferred to work at the Zhang Guizhuang Signal Factory, now arrested), colluded with Wu Tinghuai, the puppet factory director of the factory before the liberation of Tianjin, and conspired with Liang Ziyuan (now arrested), the manager of the former Huichang Iron Factory and a profiteer, to store approximately 3,000 tons of scrap steel at Liang's place. After the liberation of Tianjin, only over 1,300 tons of unusable scrap iron remained, causing the state to lose assets worth over 4 billion yuan. During our army's siege of Tianjin, Wang Qiyu took the opportunity to steal and sell 11 tons of raw materials from the Steel Fittings Factory, worth over 170 million yuan. Because the profiteer Liang Ziyuan colluded with Wang Qiyu and others to steal a large amount of state assets, he expanded from an ordinary iron factory to three iron factories after liberation.
    (2) Purchasing personnel accept bribes from profiteers, colluding with them and acting as inside agents for profiteers to defraud the state of its assets. For example, Xiang Yuming, a material procurement officer at the Tianjin Railway Hospital, colluded with Xia Hanying (now arrested), the manager of the Zhenhua Pharmacy, to purchase drugs, deliberately raising prices or buying defective products, initially calculated to cause the state to lose over 220 million yuan. In daily procurement, Xiang Yuming disregarded the interests of the state, single-mindedly facilitating the profiteer, deliberately purchasing stagnant drugs from the Zhenhua Pharmacy, causing the Tianjin Railway Hospital to accumulate 700 million yuan in capital. After the movement was launched, in order to destroy evidence, the criminal colluded with the profiteer Xia Hanying to burn the accounts. In the major corruption case uncovered in the Materials Department of the Tianjin Railway Administration, He Ming, a material clerk alone, accepted bribes from profiteers amounting to about 300 million yuan. Over 30 profiteers bribed the criminal; the losses to the state due to He Ming's acceptance of bribes are currently difficult to calculate.
    (3) Profiteers and corrupt elements collude with each other, using the convenience of railway traffic to smuggle drugs. For example, Han Baoqi, a major smuggler at the Tianjin Vehicle Depot of the Tianjin Sub-bureau, colluded with Ma Hongzao (now arrested), a major drug trafficker in Shanghai. Preliminary calculations show that the drugs trafficked on the Tianjin-Shanghai line alone amounted to over 5,450 taels of opium and 1,120 taels of heroin; the smuggled gold amounted to 305 taels. Han Baoqi was responsible for contacting drug traffickers in Tianjin and controlling the drug trafficking plan. At the same time, he tried his best to win over backward employees to join his criminal group of smuggling and drug trafficking, and even developed his party members for smuggling and drug trafficking in the larger transit stations along the railway line.
    (4) Using their positions to steal fuel coal. For example, Ren Zhenheng, the deputy section chief of the Fuel Section of the Taiyuan Sub-bureau, colluded with the coal management personnel of the Taiyuan North Station Locomotive Depot, and embezzled over 1,110 tons of fuel coal, worth over 200 million yuan, by issuing false coal tickets.
    (5) Embezzling employee welfare funds. For example, Chen Yaoming, the manager of the Tongxian Supply Station, and Zhai Zuozhou, the former manager, accepted bribes from private merchants and privately sold 30,000 jin of sorghum rice allocated to employees to private merchants for their own benefit. When welfare flour was distributed to employees in 1950, Chen also deducted flour from the workers. Preliminary calculations show that the total amount of embezzlement before and after amounted to over 100 million yuan.
    The reasons for the emergence of these huge corruption cases in the Tianjin Railway Administration are, first of all, that the corrupt practices left over from the old railways managed by the enemy puppets and the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past have not been thoroughly eliminated. Some old railway personnel who have consistently engaged in corruption do not know how to repent after liberation and are bought by profiteers, acting as inside agents of the bourgeoisie in the railway enterprises. Some are "sentries" sent by the bourgeoisie to the railway enterprises, stealing state assets by various despicable and shameless means. Secondly, a small number of cadres have been hit by sugar-coated bullets under the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie, and thus become corrupt. The serious bureaucracy of some leading cadres leaves gaps for these corrupt elements, allowing them to steal state assets unscrupulously.
    In order to further eliminate the major corrupt officials who seriously endanger the people's railway construction cause, all employees of the Tianjin Railway Administration are determined to make persistent efforts and launch a more violent offensive against the major corrupt officials, and will not withdraw until complete victory is achieved.

### 天津铁路管理局胜利进行反贪污斗争  全路破获四十七起大贪污案  大贪污犯五十八名大部已被捕法办

    天津铁路管理局胜利进行反贪污斗争
    全路破获四十七起大贪污案
    大贪污犯五十八名大部已被捕法办
    【本报讯】天津铁路管理局全路职工，春节以来，在中共铁路党委领导下，集中力量向大贪污犯进行围剿，把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动推向新的高潮，并已取得了很大胜利。到二月四日止，全路已破获四十七起贪污一亿元以上的大贪污案，有关的大贪污犯共计五十八名，其中大部分已因拒不坦白而被逮捕法办，其余的大贪污犯除促其坦白悔过外，正在彻底追查他们的罪行。天津铁路管理局这一胜利，是对资产阶级三年来向人民铁路企业猖狂进攻的一个有力反击。
    天津铁路管理局已经捕获的大贪污犯，大体上是从以下几方面来盗窃国家资财的：
    （一）明目张胆地盗窃国家巨额资财。如天津钢铁配件厂工程师、大贪污犯王启宇（留用人员，后调张贵庄号志厂工作，已被捕），在天津解放前夕，与该厂伪厂长吴廷槐串通作弊，勾结前汇昌铁工厂经理、奸商梁子元（已被捕），将约达三千吨废钢料存放梁犯子元处。天津解放后，这批钢料只剩下一千三百余吨不能用的废麻铁，使国家资财损失约达四十多亿元。王犯启宇在我军围攻天津时，并曾乘机盗卖钢铁配件厂十一吨原材料，约值一亿七千多万元。奸商梁子元由于与王犯启宇等勾结盗窃了国家大量的资财，解放后，由一家普通铁工厂，扩充到三家铁工厂。
    （二）采购人员接受奸商贿赂，与奸商狼狈为奸，充当奸商诈骗国家资财的内应。如天津铁路医院材料采购员项予鸣，勾结奸商振华药行经理夏汉英（已被捕），购买药品，故意抬高价格或买进废品，初步计算即使国家损失两亿二千余万元。在平日采购中，项犯予鸣不顾国家利益，一味便利奸商，故意从振华药行购买呆滞药材，使天津铁路医院积压资金达七亿元。运动展开后，该犯为了消灭罪证，竟勾结奸商夏犯汉英烧毁来往账目。又如在天津铁路管理局材料处破获的大贪污案中，仅材料员何铭一人，接受奸商的贿赂即达三亿元左右，向该犯行贿的奸商竟达三十余家；因何铭受贿使国家受到的损失一时尚难于计算。
    （三）奸商与贪污分子互相勾结，利用铁路行车便利走私运毒。如天津分局天津车辆段大走私犯韩宝琦，与上海大运毒犯马鸿藻（已被捕）相勾结，初步计算，仅在津沪线上贩运的毒品，即有大烟土五千四百五十多两、料面一千一百二十两；走私的黄金也有三百零五两。韩犯宝琦一方面负责与天津运毒犯联系，掌握运毒计划，同时更竭力拉拢落后职工加入其走私运毒的罪恶集团，甚至在铁路沿线的较大转运站内，都发展了他的走私运毒的党羽。
    （四）利用职权偷盗燃煤。如太原分局燃料科副科长任振恒，串通太原北站机务段管煤人员，用开空头煤票办法，贪污了燃煤一千一百一十多吨，价值二亿余元。
    （五）侵吞职工福利资财。如通县供应站经理陈耀明与前任经理翟佐周，接受私商贿赂，将配售给职工的高粱米三万斤私自售给私商，贪污自肥。一九五○年配售职工福利面粉时，陈犯也克扣工人面粉，初步计算前后贪污达一亿元以上。
    天津铁路管理局产生这些巨大贪污案件的原因，首先是过去敌伪和国民党反动派管理旧铁路时遗留下来的贪污恶习没有彻底肃清，有些一贯有贪污行为的旧铁路人员，解放后不知悔改，为奸商所收买，作了资产阶级在铁路企业中的内应；有些则为资产阶级派到铁路企业内的“坐探”，用各种卑鄙无耻的手段，偷窃国家资财。其次是少数干部在资产阶级猖狂的进攻下，被糖衣炮弹所打中，因而贪污腐化。而有些领导干部严重的官僚主义，更为这些贪污分子留下空隙，让他们肆无忌惮地盗窃国家资财。
    为了进一步肃清严重危害人民铁路建设事业的大贪污犯，天津铁路管理局全路职工，决再接再厉，向大贪污犯展开更加猛烈的攻势，不到全胜决不收兵。  （天津日报消息）
