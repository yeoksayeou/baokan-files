    We firmly support and implement the national policy of the Central People's Government and the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention of the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, the Tibetan local troops, and the monks and laypeople will unite even more closely, vigorously carry out the production and construction movement, and fully and thoroughly implement the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and fight to the end to complete the glorious and great tasks given to us by the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country.
