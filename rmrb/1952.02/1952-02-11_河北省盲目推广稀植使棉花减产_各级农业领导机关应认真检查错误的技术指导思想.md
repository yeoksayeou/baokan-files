Hebei Province's Blind Promotion of Sparse Planting Leads to Reduced Cotton Production
Agricultural Leadership Organs at All Levels Should Seriously Examine Erroneous Technical Guidance Ideologies

Last year, many agricultural leadership organs in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province failed to implement the resolution of the North China Agricultural Technology Conference on wide-ridge dense planting (i.e., widening row spacing and shortening plant spacing). Under the guidance of the erroneous idea that "fine-staple cotton is not suitable for dense planting," agricultural technical leading cadres in these areas not only called on cotton farmers to widen row spacing but also advocated sparse planting. For example, the "Cotton Planting and Pest Control Handbook" (technical training material) compiled and printed by the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office stated: "If the cotton plant bends over and produces a pound of cotton per plant, larger plant and row spacing are more suitable." At a forum of agricultural labor models held by the Hebei Provincial Farm in May last year, when summarizing cotton planting density, it was said: "It should go from dense to sparse. Liang Jiarui planted 1,200 to 1,500 plants per mu, Chen Luofen of Huaidi Village planted 900 plants per mu, and others mostly planted around 1,500 plants per mu. The trend from dense to sparse is very obvious." Farmers in Cheng'an, Feixiang, Cixian, Wu'an, and other counties in Handan Prefecture originally had the habit of dense planting; however, in order to promote sparse planting, the leadership organs of these counties mistakenly advocated sparse planting last year through various technical training classes and labor model meetings, and in some areas, a trend of considering sparse planting as glorious was formed.

Under the guidance of this technical ideology, many farmers in cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province adopted the method of wide-ridge sparse planting, resulting in a significant reduction in cotton yield per unit area. Li Yubao, a labor model from Boyan Village in Wu'an County, planted 1,700 plants per mu on his two mu of high-yield dryland cotton fields, applying 3,000 jin of sheep manure, 100 jin of bean cake, 50 jin of sesame cake, and 10 jin of fertilizer powder; however, because the number of plants was too small, there were only an average of 30,800 cotton bolls per mu; calculated at 100 bolls per jin of seed cotton, only 300 jin of seed cotton could be harvested. Jia Yuyun of the same village planted 2,260 cotton plants per mu, applying 100 jin less bean cake and 10 jin less fertilizer powder per mu than Li Yubao, but with the same other conditions, the number of bolls and yield were equal to Li Yubao's high-yield cotton field. Wen Deshi of this village planted three mu of cotton, initially planting half of it densely, averaging 2,300 plants per mu. The village cadres said, "It's too dense, thin it out!" Later, he planted the other half with 1,400 plants. As a result, the dense part averaged 33,000 cotton bolls per mu, yielding 330 jin of seed cotton, while the sparse part averaged 29,000 cotton bolls per mu, yielding only 290 jin of seed cotton. When Boyan Village conducted a production appraisal and summary this year, the farmers unanimously admitted that Li Yubao's cotton yield was reduced due to sparse planting. There are many such examples. In the appraisal movement last year in all cotton-producing areas of the province, many labor models and village cadres who adopted wide-ridge sparse planting said, "This year's planting was too sparse, next year we will plant it denser."

In order to correct this erroneous technical guidance ideology among cadres, the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Hebei Provincial People's Government organized more than ten directors of cotton planting guidance areas in the fall of last year to visit the deep plowing and dense planting cotton experiment at the Beijing State-owned Shuangqiao Farm. At the same time, a visiting group composed of more than ten people, including Xu Yinong, director of the Industrial Raw Materials Department of the Provincial Farm, and Huang Fangren, deputy director of the Technical Office of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, went to Shanxi to visit Qu Yaoli's high-yield cotton fields. These two visits played a significant role in reversing the erroneous technical guidance ideology of wide-ridge sparse planting. However, because this technical guidance ideology had been implemented relatively deeply in various cotton-producing areas of Hebei in the past, the cadres in these areas, especially some county, district, and village cadres, are currently showing some confusion in their thinking. For example, some cadres said: "The higher authorities call for sparse planting, so we advocate sparse planting; the higher authorities call for dense planting, so we advocate dense planting." Some cadres also complained that the technology promoted by the higher authorities had no standard, saying: "We used to advocate sparse planting, but now we advocate dense planting, how can we explain this to the masses of farmers?" In order to guarantee the increase of cotton yield per unit area this year and promote Qu Yaoli's advanced cotton planting experience, agricultural leadership organs at all levels in Hebei Province must seriously and thoroughly examine and quickly correct the erroneous technical guidance ideology of blindly promoting wide-ridge sparse planting in the past.

    河北省盲目推广稀植使棉花减产
    各级农业领导机关应认真检查错误的技术指导思想
    去年河北省产棉区很多农业领导机关，没有执行华北农业技术会议关于宽垅密植（即加宽行距缩短株距）的决议。这些地区的农业技术领导干部在“细绒棉不宜密植”的错误思想指导下，除号召棉农加宽行距外，又号召了稀植。如石家庄专署编印的
    “植棉除虫手册”（技术训练教材）上说：“棉花弯开身，一棵摘一斤，株行距大些是比较合适的。”河北省农场在去年五月召开的农业劳动模范座谈会上总结植棉密度时说：“要从密到稀。梁家瑞每亩一千二百株到一千五百株，槐底村陈洛芬每亩九百株，其他多在一千五百株左右。从密到稀的趋势是很明显的。”邯郸专区成安、肥乡、磁县、武安等县农民原来是有密植习惯的；但这些县的领导机关为了推广稀植，曾在去年通过各种技术训练班和劳动模范会议，错误地提倡了稀植，有的地区形成了一种以稀植为光荣的风气。
    在这种技术思想指导下，河北省产棉区的许多农民都接受了宽垅稀植的办法，结果使棉花的单位面积产量大大减少。武安县伯延村劳动模范李玉保的二亩旱地丰产棉田每亩植一千七百株，施羊粪三千斤，豆饼一百斤，香油饼五十斤，肥田粉十斤，但因株数太少，每亩平均只有三万零八百个棉铃；按
    一百个铃收一斤籽棉计算，仅可收籽棉三百斤。同村贾玉云的棉花每亩植二千二百六十株，施肥料量比李玉保每亩少施豆饼一百斤，少施肥田粉十斤，其他条件相同，结果铃数、产量和李玉保的丰产棉田相等，这个村的温得时种三亩棉花，最初有一半种的较密，每亩合二千三百株，村干部说：“太稠了，稀点吧！”以后他就把另一半种成一千四百株。结果密的每亩平均有三万三千个棉铃，可收籽棉三百三十斤，稀的每亩平均二万九千个棉铃，只能收籽棉二百九十斤。伯延村今年进行生产评比总结时，农民已一致承认李玉保的棉花减收是因为稀植。这类的例子还很多。全省各产棉区在去年的评比运动中，许多接受宽垅稀植的劳动模范和村干部都说：“今年种的稀了，明年要稠点。”
    河北省人民政府农林厅为纠正干部中的这种错误的技术指导思想，曾在去年秋天组织各植棉指导区主任十多人，到北京国营双桥农场参观棉花的深耕密植试验。同时又由省农场工业原料系主任许宜农和农林厅技术室副主任黄方仁等十多人组成参观团，到山西参观曲耀离的丰产棉田。这两次参观，对扭转宽垅稀植的错误技术指导思想作用极大。但因这种技术指导思想过去在河北各产棉区贯彻得比较深入，目前这些地区的干部，特别是部分县、区、村干部在思想上表现出有些混乱。如有的干部说：“上级叫稀植，咱就号召稀；上级叫密植，咱就号召密。”也有的干部埋怨上级推广的技术没有标准，如说：“以前号召稀植，现在又号召密植，叫我们怎么给农民群众去说？”为了保证今年提高棉花的单位面积产量，推广曲耀离的植棉先进经验，河北省各级农业领导机关，必须认真深入检查并迅速纠正过去盲目推广宽垅稀植的错误技术指导思想。
