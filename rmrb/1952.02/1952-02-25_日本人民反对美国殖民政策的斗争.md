The Japanese people's movement against America's colonial policies in Japan is rising daily. The brave struggles of workers, students, and youth in Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka, Nara, and other places in Japan, who, regardless of the brutal suppression by the police, held rallies and demonstrations on the 21st to commemorate "Anti-Colonialism Struggle Day," are clear evidence of this.

Under long-term occupation by the U.S. military, living in dire straits, the Japanese people have deeply recognized the fact that if they cannot liberate themselves from the state of colonial enslavement, they cannot escape the hardships of life and the disasters caused by rearmament and war preparations. Therefore, the patriotic Japanese people unanimously and warmly welcomed Stalin's New Year's greetings, considering it a "cry for rescue" for them; therefore, the Japanese people passionately shouted the slogans: "Oppose turning Japan into a colony" and "Demand national independence."

The recent negotiations between the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries in Tokyo regarding the so-called "Administrative Agreement" have further aroused widespread anger among patriotic Japanese people. This "Administrative Agreement" is entirely a yoke of the suzerain state enslaving the colony. According to various reports, the U.S. occupying forces will not only openly obtain Japanese military bases, enjoy "extraterritorial rights" and other privileges in Japan from the so-called "Administrative Agreement," but will also, under the guise of "emergency" provisions, be able to freely command Japanese armed forces, forcing Japan to pull chestnuts out of the fire for the U.S. aggressive plans. This situation has even aroused dissatisfaction within the Japanese ruling group and the concerns and opposition of the Japanese bourgeois newspapers. Several Japanese opposition parties convened an "Emergency Joint Council of Opposition Parties" on the 18th of this month, deciding to demand that the Yoshida government promptly explain the negotiation process of the "Administrative Agreement" to the Diet; at the same time, bourgeois newspapers such as "Asahi Shimbun," "Yomiuri Shimbun," and "Nihon Keizai" also published commentaries, warning the Yoshida government "not to cede extraterritorial rights," and expressing serious concerns about issues such as "whether Japan is still subject to U.S. military constraints abroad; whether Japan maintains full sovereign power to act independently in the event of domestic affairs."

It can be seen that the U.S. colonial policy towards Japan and the Yoshida government's traitorous behavior are facing increasingly strong resistance and opposition in Japan. The Japanese Communist Party has put forward an anti-imperialist and patriotic united election program to the people of Japan, calling on all patriotic parties and patriotic people to resolutely oppose the traitorous treaty, overthrow the reactionary Yoshida government, and establish a national liberation united government. This call from the Japanese Communist Party will undoubtedly be widely echoed among the patriotic masses in Japan and will promote the further unity of the patriotic Japanese people to fight to the end for national independence and liberation.

We firmly believe that the Japanese people's struggle against U.S. colonial policy and for independence and liberation will surely achieve final victory.

### 日本人民反对美国殖民政策的斗争

    日本人民反对美国殖民政策的斗争
    日本人民反对美国对于日本殖民政策的运动日益高涨起来了。日本东京、神奈川、大阪、奈良等地的工人、学生和青年，不顾警察的残暴镇压，在二十一日纷纷举行纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”大会和示威的英勇斗争，就是一个明证。
    处于美军长期占领之下，生活在水深火热中的日本人民，已经深刻地认识到这样一个事实，那就是：如果他们不能从殖民地的奴役状态中解放出来，他们就不可能摆脱生活的困苦和被重新武装与备战所造成的灾难。因而，日本爱国人民一致地热烈欢迎斯大林的新年贺电，并认为这个贺电是对他们的“救援的呼声”；因而，日本人民就激昂地喊出了：“反对变日本为殖民地”和“要求民族独立”的口号。
    最近美日反动派在东京举行的所谓“行政协定”的谈判，进一步激起了日本爱国人民的普遍的愤怒。这个“行政协定”，完全是宗主国奴役殖民地的枷锁。根据各方的报道，美国占领军不但将从所谓“行政协定”中公开取得日本的军事基地、在日本享有“治外法权”以及其他特权，而且将在“紧急状态”的规定的掩饰下，可以自由指挥日本武装力量，迫使日本为美国的侵略计划火中取栗。这种情形，甚至已经引起了日本统治集团内部的不满和日本资产阶级报纸的忧虑与反对。日本若干在野党派于本月十八日曾召开了“紧急在野党联合协议会”，决定要求吉田政府迅速向国会说明“行政协定”的谈判经过；同时，日本“朝日新闻”、“读卖新闻”和“日本经济”等资产阶级报刊，也纷纷发表评论，警告吉田政府“不得让出治外法权”，并对于“日本是否在国外还受美国军事约束；日本在国内有事时是否还保持充分的独立行动的主权”等问题，表示了严重的忧虑。
    可以看出：美国对日本的殖民政策和吉田政府的卖国行为，在日本正遭受着日益坚强的抵抗和反对。日本共产党已经向日本全国人民提出了反帝爱国统一选举纲领，号召一切爱国党派、爱国人民，坚决反对卖国条约，打倒吉田反动政府，建立民族解放联合政府。日本共产党的这一号召无疑将在日本爱国群众中得到广泛的响应，并促使日本爱国人民进一步团结起来，为民族的独立解放而斗争到底。
    我们深信：日本人民反对美国殖民政策、争取独立解放的斗争是一定能够取得最后的胜利的。
