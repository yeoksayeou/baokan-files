    Liao Jiaji Maintains a Hardworking and Plain Living Style
    Zhang Guangquan, Wu Yizhong
    Communist Party member Liao Jiaji, currently the Director of the Military Supplies Department of the Logistics Department of the Hubei Military Region, joined the revolutionary ranks in 1931 and the Chinese Communist Party in 1936. For twenty years, Liao Jiaji has consistently maintained the Party's fine tradition of hard work and plain living.
    From the first day he began working in the army's logistics, Liao Jiaji recognized that he must have a hardworking and plain living style to do his job well. After entering the city, Liao Jiaji has maintained this glorious tradition. The clothes he wears are patched upon patched (and these patches are all sewn by his own hands). The overcoat he wears now was issued to him by his superiors in 1946. Last year, when they issued overcoats to him, he refused, saying, "One is enough for me." Although Liao Jiaji suffers from chronic bronchitis, with some enlargement of the pulmonary hilum, and frequent pain in his waist and legs due to long-term hard work, he does not complain about it. He also frequently leads the cadres of the entire department to engage in production during their spare time. Last year, the entire department produced more than two thousand catties of vegetables for the public.
    Liao Jiaji is responsible for military supplies, and he has many dealings with merchants. He sees the ugly faces of capitalists very clearly. He often says, "Capitalists are only thinking about grabbing a few more dollars, how could they have good intentions!" In 1950, Liao Jiaji was the deputy director of a cooperative. Every time he purchased goods, he always personally understood the situation and investigated the costs. Therefore, he has never been taken advantage of by merchants. In October of last year, the Military Supplies Department ordered 20,000 umbrellas from a certain umbrella shop. The contract stipulated that each umbrella should have four nails and two coats of oil. However, the unscrupulous merchant cut corners and did not follow the contract. After Liao Jiaji discovered this, he resolutely returned the bad umbrellas and, through the Industry and Commerce Bureau, ordered the unscrupulous merchant to compensate for the loss of 28 million yuan according to the contract.
    Liao Jiaji cherishes state property very much. After arriving at the Military Supplies Department, he frequently goes to the warehouse to supervise and inspect, so that the amount of moldy and rotten materials is much less than before. Last year, only eight pairs of cotton shoes were damaged. Liao Jiaji often says to his comrades, "We must cherish public property. It is easy to damage something, but it is very difficult to replace it."
    In the Logistics Department, from the department leaders to the staff members, no one does not praise Liao Jiaji as a good Party member and a good cadre. But he is not complacent because of this. He often says, "My cultural level and political level are very low. I have not studied enough and have not done enough for the people. I must work harder in the future." When someone asked him to talk about his model deeds, he said, "There is nothing to talk about. Our People's Liberation Army is a force that is hardworking, plain living, and serves the people."

    廖家骥保持了艰苦朴素的作风
    张光泉  吴亦中
    共产党员廖家骥，现任湖北军区后勤部军需处长，一九三一年参加革命队伍，一九三六年加入中国共产党。二十年来，廖家骥始终保持着党的艰苦朴素的优良传统。
    廖家骥从作部队后勤工作的第一天起，就认清了必须有艰苦朴素的作风，才能作好自己的工作。进入城市以后，廖家骥还保持着这种光荣的传统。他穿的衣服已经是补钉加补钉了（这些补钉都是他自己亲手补的）现在他穿的一件大衣，也是一九四六年上级发给他的，去年发大衣给他，他不要，说：“我有一件就行了。”廖家骥虽然因为长期辛勤地工作得了慢性气管炎，肺门有些肿大，腰、腿也经常痛，可是他并不因此叫苦，还经常和全处干部利用工余时间进行生产。去年全处就生产了两千多斤蔬菜交公。
    廖家骥负责军需工作，跟商人打交道的时候是很多的，资本家的丑恶的面目他是看得很清楚的。他常说：“资本家是一心想多抓几个钱，那能安着好心！”一九五○年，廖家骥在合作社当副主任，每次购买货物，他总是亲自了解情况，调查成本。因此从没吃过商人的亏。去年十月，军需处在某雨伞店定做了两万把雨伞，订合同时规定每把雨伞要有四个钉子，上两道油。但奸商偷工减料，没按合同办事。廖家骥发现这件事后，坚决把坏雨伞退回去，并通过工商局根据合同令奸商赔偿了损失费二千八百万元。
    廖家骥十分爱护国家财富。他到军需处后，经常到仓库去督促检查，使霉烂的物资比以前少得多了。去年棉鞋只坏了八双。廖家骥经常对同志们说：“公家的东西要爱惜，损坏一件很容易，添一件就很难了。”
    在后勤部，上至部首长，下至工作员，没有一个不称赞廖家骥是一个好党员，是一个好干部的。但是他并不因此自满。他常说：“我的文化水平、政治水平都很低，学习不够，没有给人民作多少事情，今后还必须更加努力工作。”有人要求他讲一些关于他的模范事迹，他说：“没有什么好讲的，咱们人民解放军就是一个艰苦朴素为人民服务的部队。”
