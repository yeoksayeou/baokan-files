Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The struggle to besiege major grafters in central organs has entered a new stage of continued expansion and victory from today onwards.

    In the phase from the public trial on February 1st to the 15th, central organs have captured many major grafters and many small and medium-sized grafters, and have isolated many grafters who attempted to quibble. More importantly, the leadership and the masses in various organs have gained rich experience in capturing grafters during this half-month of struggle.

    The Central Committee for Economy and Austerity Examination has, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, resolved: We will not cease until all grafters, big and small, are thoroughly and completely eliminated. It has now been tentatively decided to continue this struggle in central organs intensively for another month. If one month is not enough, it will definitely be extended again.

    In the next few days, central organs will systematically summarize the experiences of the previous stage, redeploy forces, and strengthen investigation and research work, in order to launch a more fierce attack on those grafters who still refuse to confess their crimes. All grafters should face up to the firm will of the People's Government to eliminate evil completely. If they quickly wake up, perform meritorious service to redeem themselves, and frankly confess their crimes and expose the crimes of others, they may still be able to seek lenient treatment from the government. If they still refuse to confess and attempt to escape, they will inevitably not escape the giant palm of the people, and will inevitably receive severe sanctions.

    中央各机关重新部署力量
    围攻大贪污犯斗争进入新阶段
    非把一切贪污犯彻底全部清出决不收兵
    【新华社十六日讯】中央各机关围攻大贪污犯的斗争，从今日起又进入了一个继续扩展胜利的新阶段。
    在二月一日公审大会到十五日这一个阶段中，中央各机关捉住了许多重大的贪污犯和许多中小贪污犯，并且把许多妄图狡赖的贪污犯孤立起来。更重要的是，各机关的领导方面和群众在这半个月的斗争中获得了丰富的捕捉贪污犯的经验。
    中央节约检查委员会根据毛主席的指示，已下定决心：非到把一切大小贪污犯彻底全部清出，决不收兵；现已暂定把中央各机关的这个斗争继续紧张进行一个月，如一个月时间不足，决再予延长。
    中央各机关在今后几天内，将有系统地总结前一个阶段的经验，重新部署力量，加强调查研究工作，以便向那些至今仍不坦白认罪的贪污犯展开一个更为猛烈的进攻。一切贪污犯应该正视人民政府这种除恶务尽的坚决意志。如果他们迅速醒悟，立功自赎，坦白供认自己的罪行和揭发别人的罪行，他们还有可能求得政府宽大的处理。如果他们仍然拒不坦白，妄图幸免，他们必然逃不脱人民的巨掌，而必将得到严厉的制裁。
