    East China Military and Political Committee's Culture Department
    Serious Bureaucratic Work Style Exists Among Certain Leading Personnel
    In the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, the East China Culture Department has fully exposed the serious shortcomings in the department's work and the non-proletarian ideological style of its leading cadres. The facts revealed clearly demonstrate the department's weak political and ideological leadership and the confusion in literary and artistic thought. The ideological style of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie has occupied a leading position in all aspects of the department. Consequently, from top to bottom, there is a serious phenomenon of detachment from reality, detachment from politics, formalism, and extravagance.
    Huang Yuan, the Second Deputy Minister of the East China Culture Department who is in charge of actual leadership, has a patriarchal leadership style. He is busy with trivial matters all day long, but completely abandons leadership on important ideological and policy issues. Work is done without prior planning or inspection. Reports from below are not reviewed, and accumulated documents are not processed. Because he is afraid of taking responsibility, he adopts methods of pushing and procrastination to perfunctorily deal with many tasks. When problems arise, he panics and grabs at straws, and then everything disappears without a trace. This is a typical muddle-headed bureaucratic work style.
    The East China Culture Department's working principle is "Popularization first, facing the entire region, strengthening ideological leadership," but this has not been well implemented in concrete work. This can also be seen from the allocation of funds: in 1951, the East China Culture Department and its directly affiliated units accounted for half of the operating expenses, while the provinces and regions of East China only accounted for the other half. The allocation and use of funds are not based on actual needs, but on who can make the most noise and fight for more. He also neglects the financial system. For example, the Culture Department subsidizes "mass art" by 1,000 units each month. According to a recent inspection, this is not necessarily necessary, but Huang Yuan has never allowed the Audit Department to check the accounts and understand the expenditure situation, emphasizing "political guarantee" and only reimbursing expenses based on a receipt each month. Huang Yuan himself also has many instances of not distinguishing between public and private matters and violating regulations. For example, he spent 80 million yuan from the operating budget to buy a car from the film studio for his own use, but on the reimbursement slip, he approved it as a subsidy to the film studio. In addition, he had four servants at home, exceeding the regulations. The Party Branch Committee raised objections to him, but he not only did not accept them, but also questioned the objecting branch committee members in front of the masses in a dissatisfied tone, which had a very bad impact on the masses.
    According to many people in the East China Culture Department, Huang Yuan's study is very poor. Since liberation, no one has seen him write a guiding article on cultural work in the newspaper. After the "The Life of Wu Xun" incident, as the leader of cultural administration in East China, he did not take the lead in making self-criticism, but smugly said: "Fortunately, I didn't write any articles in the past, otherwise there would be problems." Since then, he has become even more cautious, afraid of taking responsibility, and tried his best to push away many tasks, even abandoning leadership. For example, the News and Publication Bureau prepared to establish a joint public-private comic strip publishing organization led by the Culture Department, but Huang Yuan disagreed, saying: "We have already been criticized for publishing 'The Life of Wu Xun' before. Who will be responsible if there are any problems in the future?" Another example is that the Music Record Production Factory requested leadership from the Culture Department, but the Culture Department repeatedly declined and eventually ignored it. After the film "Glorious and Brilliant" was screened in Shanghai, opinions on the film were divided. The Propaganda Department of the East China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee invited leading comrades from the cultural circles to watch it once, preparing to hold a forum for discussion and research after watching it. After receiving the notice, Huang Yuan hurriedly asked his subordinates to collect review materials from various newspapers and prepare a summary after research, but because of the short time, the materials were not collected in time. Fearing that he would not be able to express his opinions after watching the movie, he simply did not watch the movie or participate in the forum.
    Huang Yuan regards cultural and artistic undertakings as a "burden," believing that "it is better to carry one less," or only knows how to spend money to get things done. When the Cultural Center was transferred from the Ministry of Education to the leadership of the Ministry of Culture, Huang Yuan believed that "this is a burden, it is best not to manage it, as long as you subsidize it with funds." When the Songjiang Prefectural Committee's Cultural Work Troupe came to Shanghai to perform "The Great Emancipation of the Peasants," and the Drama School's Cultural Work Troupe performed "Blueprint of the New Yi River," the box office was not good. The Culture Department did not provide political or ideological assistance, but supported them by buying out the shows, spending more than 20 million yuan.
    The atmosphere of extravagance, waste, and socializing with guests is very popular in the East China Culture Department, from top to bottom. Zhong Lin, the Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the Department, said in his self-criticism: "The Culture Department must invite guests to the Jinjiang 13th Floor or Mei Longzhen. When guests come, they are sent to the Shanghai Mansion or Leyi Restaurant to stay." For more famous actors, they always socialize by inviting them to dinner. Last year, at the East China Cultural Administration Conference, the department spent 8 million yuan to specially make a set of conference tables, which were piled into the warehouse after the meeting. During the conference, guests were invited four times under various names. These expenses could not be covered by administrative expenses, so they were reimbursed from the operating expenses in violation of regulations. The department currently has four wire recorders and eight cameras. From the minister to the various departments, each has a small library. Various departments blindly purchase equipment and materials. After purchasing them, they are not used, and things worth hundreds of millions of yuan are piled up. When making budgets, they are expanded as much as possible. For example, the original budget of the East China Opera Research Institute in 1952 did not exceed 4 billion yuan. Instead of asking them to reduce it as much as possible, Huang Yuan asked them to increase it. As a result, various troupes increased the budget for purchasing cameras, tape recorders, etc., and barely made up 6 billion yuan. At the end of the year before last, the department had a surplus of more than 10 billion yuan. The leaders were afraid of being criticized for turning it over to the state, so they painstakingly studied how to spend the money. As a result, the various units under the department desperately purchased things. In one day, the department's Audit Department issued more than 120 checks. Zhong Lin, Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the Department, gave the Film Department 7 billion yuan, asking them to quickly order a large number of film equipment from abroad. Of the funds used by the Film Department, 10.4 billion yuan has not been reimbursed even after a year. At the end of last year, in order to avoid cash management and fear that funds would be frozen by the state, Zhong Lin withdrew 100 million yuan in cash and deposited it in the department, and also colluded with Yi Bing, Deputy Director of the Art Management Department of the department, to hide 700 million yuan in the Film Department. It was not until after the launch of this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign that they were submitted, causing a considerable amount of state funds to stagnate and seriously violate financial regulations.
    There are also serious problems in the reform of opera in East China. The East China Culture Department rarely provides political and ideological leadership to the East China Opera Research Institute. In fact, it is entirely managed by Yi Bing, Deputy Director of the Art Management Department. Yi Bing's ideological and work style problems are extremely serious. He incorrectly understands "national style" and believes that national style is formal extravagance. Under his influence, the scenery, costumes, and props of the troupe's performances are all designed to be luxurious, while the ideological content of the play is not emphasized. For example, the decoration cost of the Popular Theater was more than 260 million yuan. Each dressing room had a lamp, and everything was striving for "modernization." When the Yue Opera Troupe came to Beijing to perform, the people and props were loaded into five trucks, and a passenger car and a freight car were chartered by train, with a round-trip expenditure of more than 400 million yuan.
    Due to the leadership's failure to attach importance to organizing creation and the lack of a script review system, problems were often discovered in the repertoire performed by the Peking Opera Troupe and the Yue Opera Troupe only during the rehearsal before the performance. Temporary scrambling to revise them caused a lot of losses in manpower and material resources. For example, at the end of last year, the Yue Opera Troupe was afraid of being criticized for not performing for a long time, but it did not have a script. It temporarily decided to perform "Xiang Lin's Wife" and immediately advertised to accept ticket reservations. After the tickets were reserved, they began to rehearse the play, but found that the script had fundamental errors, so they had to decide to stop the performance. However, tickets had been sold for a week, and the total loss was 200 million yuan. The refund of the reserved tickets caused even more dissatisfaction among the audience.
    In the early stage of launching the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the East China Culture Department, Huang Yuan suppressed democracy. After the leadership corrected him and the masses criticized him, he showed a sincere attitude of acceptance. Now the movement is turning to a stage of universal and in-depth inspection.

    华东军政委员会文化部
    某些领导人员存在着严重的官僚主义作风
    华东文化部在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争中，已充分暴露了该部工作中存在的严重缺点和领导干部的非无产阶级的思想作风。从已揭露的事实中，明显地表现了该部政治思想领导的薄弱，和文艺思想的混乱，资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想作风已在该部的各方面占据了领导地位，因而从上到下，脱离实际，脱离政治，形式主义，铺张浪费的现象十分严重。
    华东文化部负实际领导责任的第二副部长黄源的领导作风是家长式的，成天忙于琐屑的事务，对于重要的思想政策问题，却完全放弃领导。工作事前无计划，又无检查。下面来的报告不审查，积压的公文不处理。因为怕负责任，对许多工作都采取推、拖的办法来敷衍。出了问题手忙脚乱，临时抓一把，过后又烟消云散。这是一种典型的糊里糊涂的官僚主义作风。
    华东文化部的工作方针是“普及第一，面向全区，加强思想领导”，但在具体工作中并没有很好这样做。这从经费的分配上也可以看出来：一九五一年的业务经费，华东文化部和直属单位就占去了一半，华东各省区仅占一半。经费的支配动用不是根据实际需要，而是谁能吵谁能闹就可多争一些。对财经制度他也是忽视的，如文化部每月补助“群众文艺”一千个单位，据最近检查出来，并不是必须补助的，但黄源一向不允许会审科去查账和了解开支情况，强调“政治担保”，每月仅凭一张收条就报销了。黄源个人也有许多地方公私不分，违反制度的情形。如从事业费内开支八千万元，从电影厂买来一辆汽车自用，但在报销的条子上却批着是作为给电影厂的补助费。另外他家里用了四个佣人，超过制度，党支部委员会曾向他提过意见，他不但不接受，还在群众面前用不满的口气责问提意见的支委，给群众影响很坏。
    据华东文化部许多人反映，黄源的学习是很差的。解放以来，大家没看见他在报上写过一篇有关文化工作方面的指导性文章。电影“武训传”问题发生后，作为华东文化行政工作的领导人，他不带头检讨，却沾沾自喜地说：“过去亏得没写文章，否则也出毛病。”而从此他就更缩手缩脚，怕负责任，对许多工作尽量推掉，甚至放弃领导。如新闻出版局准备要美术出版社成立一个公私合营的连环画统一出版机构，由文化部领导，但黄源不同意，说：“以前出版过‘武训传’已经受了批评，以后再出问题，谁负责任？”又如音乐唱片制片厂请求文化部领导，文化部也一再推托，终于不管。影片“光辉灿烂”在上海放映后，舆论对这个影片评价不一，中共中央华东局宣传部邀集文化界领导同志看一次，准备在看后座谈研究。黄源接到通知后匆忙之间叫下面收集各报评论资料，拟研究后作一总结，但由于时间匆促，材料收集不及，他怕看了电影拿不出主见，就干脆不去看电影，也不参加座谈。
    黄源把文化艺术事业看作“包袱”，“少背一个好一个”，或者是只知道出钱了事。当文化馆从教育部转给文化部领导时，黄源认为“这是包袱，最好不要管，只要在经费上补助补助好了。”松江地委文工团来上海演“农民大翻身”，及戏剧专业学校文工团演出“新沂河蓝图”时，卖座不好，文化部不从政治上思想上加以帮助，却用包场来支持，花了二千多万元。
    华东文化部铺张浪费交际请客的风气，从上到下都很风行。该部秘书处副处长钟林自己检讨时说：“文化部请客非锦江十三层或梅龙镇不可，有客人来就送上海大厦或乐义饭店住。”对于较有名的演员，也总以请客吃饭相交往。去年开华东文化行政会议，部里化了八百万元特地制了一套会议桌，开完会就堆进仓库。会议期间用各种名义请客四次，这些费用，行政费内开支不了，就违反制度在事业费中报销。部里现有钢丝录音机四架，照像机八架，从部长到各科，各有小图书室。各处盲目地买器械材料，买了没用，积压了价值好几亿的东西。造预算，尽量扩大。如华东戏曲研究院一九五二年预算原来不超过四十亿，黄源不是要他们尽量减缩，而是要他们增加，于是各剧团增加购买照像机、录音机等预算开支，硬凑满了六十亿。前年年底该部经费剩余一百多亿，领导方面怕上缴了要受批评，便苦心研究如何用掉这笔钱。于是该部所属各单位拼命购买东西，在一天内，部里会审科就开出了一百二十多张支票。该部秘书处副处长锺林给了电影处七十亿，要他们赶快向外订购大批电影器材。电影处用去的经费中有一百零四亿，事隔一年，到现在还没报销。去年年底，锺林为了逃避现金管理和怕资金被国家冻结，曾把一亿元现钞提出存在部里，又和该部艺术事业管理处副处长伊兵把七亿元打埋伏存在电影处，在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动展开后才提出，使一笔数目不小的国家资金停滞周转，严重违反财政制度。
    华东的戏曲改革工作，也存在着严重问题。对华东戏曲研究院，华东文化部很少给以政治上思想上的领导，实际上完全由艺术事业管理处副处长伊兵个人在管，而伊兵在思想作风上的毛病是极严重的。他不正确地理解“国家气派”，以为国家气派就是形式上的铺张。在他的影响下，造成剧团演出时布景、服装、道具都力求豪华，而对戏的思想内容却不注重。如大众剧院装修费就用了二亿六千多万，化妆间一人一个灯头，一切力求“现代化”。越剧团来北京演出时，人和道具行李装了五卡车，坐火车包一节客车，一节货车，来回开支共四亿多元。
    由于领导方面没有重视组织创作，又缺乏剧本审查制度，京剧团和越剧团演出的剧目，常常是在临演出前的彩排时才发现问题，临时手忙脚乱，匆匆修改，造成人力物力上的很多损失。如去年年底越剧团因长期未演出，怕受批评，而又没有剧本，临时想演“祥林嫂”，马上登报接受定票，定票后才开始排戏，却发现那剧本有原则性错误，只好决定停演，但已经卖出一星期的票了，全部损失共计二亿元。定出的票子退票，更造成观众不满。
    华东文化部在开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的初期，黄源有压制民主的情形，经领导方面纠正和群众批评后，他才表现了诚恳接受的态度。现在运动正转向普遍深入检查的阶段。
