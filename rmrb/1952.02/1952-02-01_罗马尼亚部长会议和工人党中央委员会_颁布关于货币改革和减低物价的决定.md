Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 31st - According to TASS, the Romanian Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party, on the 27th, issued a decision on the implementation of currency reform and price reduction, stating: Since the implementation of currency reform in 1947, fundamental changes have taken place in Romania: all political power has been taken over by the working class in alliance with the working peasants, and basic industrial enterprises, transportation, and banks have become state property. The national economic plans for 1949 and 1950 formulated by the state, as well as the plan for the first year (1951) of the Five-Year Plan, have all been overfulfilled. Last year, the level of industrial production increased by 23 percent, and the output of grains and other crops has greatly increased. Over the past three years, many old enterprises have been restored, and new enterprises have been established. Last year, the total investment in basic construction was double that of 1949. Labor productivity is steadily increasing, and production costs are decreasing year by year. The poverty, suffering, and unemployment suffered by the working people under the bourgeois-landlord regime have been eliminated forever. However, at the same time, there are also certain phenomena hindering the economic development of Romania. Speculators and other urban and rural bourgeois elements, agents of US and British imperialism, have been engaging in activities to undermine the Leu (Romanian currency) and disintegrate urban and rural trade. Therefore, it is necessary to implement currency reform to consolidate the Leu's exchange rate and increase its gold reserves; it is necessary to establish an exchange rate based on the Soviet Ruble—the most stable currency in the world—to replace the previous exchange rate based on the US dollar—an unstable currency with constantly declining purchasing power.

The decision pointed out: The new banknotes of the Romanian National Bank have been in circulation since January 28, 1952, with denominations of ten, twenty-five, and one hundred Lei; various treasury bonds and coins issued by the Romanian Ministry of Finance will also be in circulation at the same time. The cash of residents, private enterprises, and state, cooperative, and public enterprises, institutions, and organizations, as well as deposits in savings banks and trust institutions, and accounts between each other, will be exchanged for new currency in accordance with reasonable exchange methods stipulated by the government.

The decision went on to point out that favorable conditions have been created for reducing retail prices of consumer goods due to the increase in production of state-owned and cooperative enterprises, the planned increase in labor productivity, and the reduction in production costs. The decision then listed price reductions for various food and industrial products, including bread and baked goods, and cotton fabrics reduced by 5 to 10 percent; macaroni products and grains reduced by 17.5 to 20 percent; meat, meat products, and canned meat reduced by 5 to 20 percent; clothing and knitwear reduced by 5 to 15 percent; and medicines reduced by 15 percent.

    罗马尼亚部长会议和工人党中央委员会  
    颁布关于货币改革和减低物价的决定
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚部长会议和罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会，在二十七日发布关于实行货币改革和减低物价的决定说：自从一九四七年实行货币改革以来，罗马尼亚已发生了根本的变化：一切政治权力已由和劳动农民联盟的工人阶级接管，基本的工业企业、运输业和银行已成为国家的财产。国家制订的一九四九、一九五○年国民经济计划以及五年计划的第一年（一九五一年）计划，都已超额完成。去年工业生产水平已提高了百分之二十三，谷物和其他农作物的产量已大大地增加了。三年来许多旧的企业已经恢复，新的企业已经建立起来。去年基本建设的投资总额为一九四九年的二倍。劳动生产率正在稳步提高，生产成本一年比一年减低。在资产阶级—地主政权下，劳动人民遭到的贫困、苦难和失业已经永远地消灭了。但是，和这同时，也存在着某些阻碍罗马尼亚经济发展的现象。投机倒把分子和其他城乡资产阶级分子、美英帝国主义的代理人曾进行活动，想破坏列伊（罗币）并瓦解城乡贸易。因此，必须实施货币改革以巩固列伊的外汇率和增加它的黄金储备；必须建立以苏联的卢布——世界上最稳定的货币为基础的外汇率，而代替以前以美金——购买力不断下降的不稳定的货币——为基础的外汇率。
    决定指出：罗马尼亚国家银行的新钞票，自一九五二年一月二十八日起流通，票面价格分十、二十五和一百列伊三种；罗马尼亚财政部所发行的各种库券和硬币也将同时流通。各地的居民、私营企业和国家、合作社及公营的企业、机关、组织的现款，以及在储蓄银行和信托机关的存款和彼此之间往来的账款，一概依照政府规定的合理的兑换办法兑换新币。
    决定接着指出：由于国营企业和合作社企业的生产增加，由于劳动生产率有计划提高和生产成本减低的结果，减低消费品零售价格的有利条件已经形成。决定接着开列了各种食品和工业品减价的清单，其中面包和烘烤面制品、棉织品减价百分之五到十，通心面制品和谷类减价百分之十七点五到二十，肉类、肉制品和罐头肉减价百分之五到二十，衣著和针织品减价百分之五到十五，药品减价百分之十五等。
