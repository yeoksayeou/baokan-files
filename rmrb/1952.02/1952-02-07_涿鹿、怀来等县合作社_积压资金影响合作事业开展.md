    Cooperatives in Zhuolu, Huailai and Other Counties
    Accumulated Funds Affecting the Development of Cooperative Undertakings
    To the Editor: Cooperatives in Zhuolu, Huailai, Guyuan, Shangdu, Lingqiu, Chicheng and other counties in Chahar Province have serious problems of accumulated funds and extravagant waste in business management. The Zhuolu County Cooperative purchased more than 12 million yuan worth of agricultural implements, which have been stockpiled for more than a year and have not yet been sold. The Huailai County Cooperative purchased 1,036 rakes in August of the year before last, which were stockpiled until April of last year when they were sold at a loss. The Guyuan County Cooperative borrowed 50 million yuan from the bank last year, but when it came time to repay the loan, 30 million yuan of it had not been used at all. When the Shangdu County Cooperative purchased native cloth from Zhangjiakou in August of last year, it bought more than 11,000 bolts without investigation. Because they did not meet the needs of local cooperative members, more than 7,000 bolts are still stockpiled, totaling approximately 500 million yuan in accumulated funds. The sausage casings purchased last year and the agricultural implements purchased have not yet been sold, totaling 747 million yuan in accumulated funds.

    In addition, the phenomenon of primary cooperatives in various counties owing money to the county cooperatives is also very serious. For example, several primary cooperatives in Zhuolu County have owed the county cooperative more than 100 million yuan for a long time. More than 110 million yuan of accounts receivable from the Shangdu County Cooperative from the year before last has not yet been collected.

    The above situation has seriously affected the capital turnover of the cooperative undertakings and created a very bad impression among the cooperative members. It is hoped that the Chahar Provincial Cooperative Federation and relevant departments will quickly conduct a thorough work inspection and strengthen the leadership of county and primary cooperatives.

    涿鹿、怀来等县合作社
    积压资金影响合作事业开展
    编辑同志：察哈尔省涿鹿、怀来、沽源、商都、灵邱、赤城等县合作社，在业务经营管理上，有严重的积压资金和铺张浪费现象。涿鹿县社购进价值一千二百多万元的农具，已积压了一年多，到现在还没有卖出。怀来县社在前年八月买进一千零三十六件?朳，一直积压到去年四月，始赔本卖出。沽源县社去年向银行贷款五千万元，到还款时，其中有三千万元还根本没有动用过。商都县社去年八月从张家口购买土布时，没有经过调查，就买了一万一千多匹，因不合当地社员需要，到现在还积压着七千多匹，共积压了资金约五亿元；去年收购的肠衣和买进的农具等，直到现在还没有推销出去，共积压了资金七亿四千七百多万元。
    此外，各县基层社拖欠县社货款的现象也很严重。如涿鹿县的几个基层社，长时期拖欠县社货款达一亿元以上；商都县社前年的债权一亿一千多万元，到现在还没收齐。
    以上这些情况，严重地影响了合作事业的资金周转，并在社员群众中造成很不好的印象。希望察哈尔省合作总社和有关部门，迅速来一次彻底的工作检查，加强对县社、基层社的领导。  晓晨
