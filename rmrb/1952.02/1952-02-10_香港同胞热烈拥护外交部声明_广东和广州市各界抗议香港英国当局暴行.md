Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 6th: Hong Kong compatriots from all walks of life have been writing to the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po newspapers in recent days, expressing their warm support for the statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government regarding the Hong Kong British authorities' continuous arrests and deportations of Chinese residents. A letter jointly written by thirteen young people, including He Hua and Xiu Qiong, stated: "We support the Foreign Ministry's statement of January 25th. Our struggle for legitimate rights is not isolated because we have the support of our powerful motherland and the people of the whole country. The Hong Kong British government's attempt to suppress the patriotic movement of the Chinese people in Hong Kong through arrests will never succeed. We hope that the Hong Kong British government will immediately cease such measures that persecute Chinese residents and effectively guarantee personal freedom and freedom of residence." A letter signed by "A group of workers" stated: "The statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs fully demonstrates the motherland's love and care for us, and further strengthens our belief in and understanding of the motherland. We absolutely cannot tolerate the Hong Kong British government's atrocities against our compatriots, and we must persist in the struggle against persecution!" Another eighteen readers, including Huo Quan, Feng Jian, and Fang Zhijian, stated in a joint letter: "We firmly support the solemn statement of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This statement makes us further realize that the Hong Kong British government's persecution of our patriotic compatriots is not an accidental local incident, but the result of the British government's further submission to pressure from the US government. We must insist on safeguarding our legitimate rights and interests in Hong Kong, which can never be suppressed by violence!" All letters from the vast number of compatriots published in Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po unanimously expressed that, with the support of the powerful motherland, they have full confidence and strength to shatter the Hong Kong British government's conspiracy of persecution.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 8th: Representatives from sixteen people's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties in Guangdong Province and Guangzhou City held a meeting in Guangzhou on February 6th to protest the Hong Kong British government's heinous crimes of persecuting Chinese residents and to organize a delegation to visit Dongtou Village in Kowloon City to express sympathy to the Chinese disaster victims who have suffered from the catastrophe of fire and are constantly subjected to persecution by British imperialism. The meeting was attended by representatives from sixteen people's organizations, including the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, the Guangdong Branch of the China People's Relief Administration, the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, the Guangdong Provincial Farmers Association, the Preparatory Committee of the Guangdong Provincial Democratic Youth Federation, the Guangzhou Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Guangzhou Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and representatives from democratic parties in Guangdong and Guangzhou, totaling more than one hundred people. Sima Wensen and Shu Shi, film artists who were unreasonably deported by the Hong Kong British government, as well as Li Wenxing, the chief representative of the disaster victims in Dongtou Village, Kowloon City, and Xian Peiling, the director of the Kowloon City branch of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Textile Dyeing Industry Workers' Union, also attended the meeting and reported on their experiences of persecution.

At the meeting, Rao Zhangfeng, Secretary-General of the Guangdong Branch of the China People's Relief Administration, spoke. He said: "The Hong Kong British government's series of atrocities of illegally deporting our film artists and persecuting Chinese disaster victims in the Kowloon City fire area have aroused the anger of the people of the whole country. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government has issued a statement on January 25th to lodge a serious protest with the British government. The people of Guangdong have close relations with our compatriots in Hong Kong, so we firmly support the Foreign Ministry's statement, oppose the reactionary atrocities of British imperialism, and will take practical actions to support our compatriots in Hong Kong who are unreasonably persecuted by the Hong Kong British government."

Representatives from various people's organizations and democratic parties unanimously expressed their support for the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government in their speeches and firmly supported the just struggle of our compatriots in Hong Kong.

The meeting adopted a joint protest letter from people's organizations in Guangdong and Guangzhou against the Hong Kong British government's crimes of persecuting our compatriots. The protest letter listed a series of reactionary atrocities and provocative acts recently committed by the Hong Kong British government in persecuting Chinese residents, and solemnly pointed out: "After our Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government issued a statement, Liu Qin, another representative of the disaster victims in Dongtou Village, was arrested and deported by the Hong Kong British government. Obviously, the Hong Kong British government has no intention of stopping its shameless atrocities of persecuting our compatriots, which we absolutely cannot tolerate. In addition to firmly supporting our Foreign Ministry's statement of January 25th, we hereby solemnly warn the Hong Kong British government: The Chinese people will never allow others to bully and persecute us, let alone fear all the dying and crazy provocations of imperialism! We must consider taking effective measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of our compatriots to stop the continued occurrence of the Hong Kong British authorities' shameless atrocities. The British government should bear full responsibility for the consequences of all its reactionary atrocities."

The meeting also decided to organize a delegation from all walks of life in Guangdong and Guangzhou to express sympathy to the disaster victims in Dongtou Village, Kowloon City.
