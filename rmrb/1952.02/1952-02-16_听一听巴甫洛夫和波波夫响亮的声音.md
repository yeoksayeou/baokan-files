　　Listen to the Loud Voices of Pavlov and Popov
　　In our universities, some teachers send their "painstakingly researched" scientific papers to American magazines, and some hope to send them to American magazines. In the eyes of these people, it is "supreme glory" to have their scientific papers published and their names appear in American magazines, and it shows that they are up to "international standards." They also have a "theory" that "science knows no borders."
　　Some students protested, saying: "These teachers eat the people's millet, but they vomit American papers!"
　　Obviously, these people have forgotten where they grew up; these people have forgotten that they are people's teachers in the new China's universities; these people have forgotten who they should serve.
　　Is it "supreme glory" to publish one's scientific papers and have one's name appear in American magazines? Does "science know no borders?" Please listen to the voice of the great Russian materialist physiologist Pavlov. When George Hix, a representative of the American Medical Association, said to Pavlov: "I can arrange everything. In short, from a human point of view, it is the same to you where you work." But how did Pavlov "retort" to this representative of American capital? He said: "The same? No, dear sir, it is not the same to me. Science has no borders, but scientists must have a motherland. I am a Russian, sir! For better or worse, my country is here. I am not a mouse, you know."
　　Some teachers in our universities who are nostalgic for "American standards" should seriously examine their position. And they should know: this is not just a matter of class position, it is also a matter of national position. Because the so-called "international standards" are actually just "American standards." This is coveting capitalist "civilization" and flattering imperialist "culture"; this is an anti-patriotic act of ideologically relying on imperialism!
　　Please listen again to the voice of the talented Russian scholar and radio inventor A.S. Popov. When an agent of a French company proposed to A.S. Popov that he sell the rights to his radio invention, A.S. Popov declared so angrily: "I am a Russian, and I have the right to dedicate all my knowledge, all my labor, and all my achievements only to my motherland."

### 听一听巴甫洛夫和波波夫响亮的声音

　　听一听巴甫洛夫和波波夫响亮的声音
    在我们的高等学校里，有的教师把自己“苦心钻研”的科学论文送到美国的杂志上去，有的指望能送到美国的杂志上去。在这些人看来，只有在美国的杂志上发表自己的科学论文和出现自己的名字，那才“无上光荣”，那才显得自己够得上“国际水平”。他们还有一种“理论”，那便是“科学无国界”。
    有的同学抗议了，说：“这些先生吃的是人民的小米，但吐出来的是美国论文！”
    很明显，这些人是忘记了他们所生长的地方；这些人忘记了自己是新中国高等学校的人民教师；这些人忘记了他们应该为谁服务。
    是在美国的杂志上发表自己的科学论文和出现自己的名字就“无上光荣”么？是“科学无国界”么？请听一听伟大的俄罗斯的唯物论生理学家巴甫洛夫的声音罢。当美国医药协会代表乔治·希克斯向巴甫洛夫说：“我能安排一切，总之，从人类的观点看来，你在那里工作都是一样的。”但巴甫洛夫是怎样“回敬”这个美国资本家的代表的呢？他说：“一样？不，亲爱的先生，对我才不一样呢。科学没有国界，但是科学家一定要有祖国。我是俄国人，先生！好好坏坏，我的国家在这儿。我不是一只老鼠，你知道。”
    我们的高等学校教师中的一些留恋“美国标准”的先生们应该好好检查自己的立场。而且应该知道：这不只是一个阶级立场问题，这同时是一个民族立场问题。因为那种所谓合乎“国际水平”，实际上只不过是合乎“美国标准”而已。这是眼热资本主义的“文明”和谄媚帝国主义的“文化”；这是从思想意识上去依附帝国主义的反爱国主义的行为！
    请再听一听天才的俄罗斯学者、无线电发明家阿·司·波波夫的声音。当法国商号的代理人向阿·司·波波夫提议出卖他的无线电发明权时，阿·司·波波夫曾经是如此愤怒地宣称：“我是俄国人，所有自己的知识，所有自己的劳动，所有自己的成就，有权只献给自己的祖国。”
