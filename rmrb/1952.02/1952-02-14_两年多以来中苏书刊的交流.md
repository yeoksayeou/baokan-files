    Exchanges of Chinese and Soviet Books and Periodicals Over the Past Two Years
    Chen Yingnan

    In the two years since founding of the People's Republic of China and the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Allliance and Mutual Assistance, great progress has been made in Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges. This has played an extremely important role in the mutual understanding and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The situation of book and periodical exchanges in cultural exchanges over the past two years is described below:

    (I)

    In the past two years, many cultural organizations in China and the Soviet Union have established close ties and regularly exchange various books and periodicals with each other. As for the books and periodicals sent by the Soviet Union to Chinese cultural organizations, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association alone received 29,022 books, 30,323 magazines, 14 Russian newspapers, and 1,300 sets of complete pictures by October of last year.

    In March of last year, the Department of Oriental Studies of Leningrad University returned to China eleven volumes of the "Yongle Encyclopedia," a rare 14th-century Chinese book and an important lost classic of Chinese culture, from its library collection, fully demonstrating its care and respect for Chinese culture.

    China's scientific and cultural organizations have also gifted various books, periodicals, and cultural and artistic works to Soviet cultural organizations. The Sino-Soviet Friendship Association alone distributed more than 10,000 books and periodicals to the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Soviet Writers' Association, the Lenin Library, and the Moscow University Library. The Chinese Academy of Sciences also sent more than 2,000 books and periodicals to various Soviet scientific and cultural organizations.

    The International Bookstore has imported a large number of Soviet publications into China and exported New China's publications to the Soviet Union, greatly strengthening Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges. According to statistics from the head office of the International Bookstore: from January of the year before last to the end of June last year, the Soviet Union supplied China with 9,365,844 books, 2,606,847 periodicals, and 1,521,915 maps and records; from January to August last year, 380,280 books and periodicals were exported from China to the Soviet Union.

    Soviet publications are warmly welcomed by the broad masses in China and have had an unparalleled positive impact.

    Famous Soviet novels such as "How the Steel Was Tempered," "Days and Nights," "Fear and Courage," "A Real Man," and "The Young Guard" have become the favorite reading materials of commanders and fighters in the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and have played a tremendous inspiring role. Many people, when marching with light packs, would rather discard other clothing than abandon these books. In hospitals, staff members often read novels such as "How the Steel Was Tempered" and "A Real Man" to the wounded. Inspired by the moving stories of the Soviet Union, many wounded soldiers have become more determined in their fighting spirit. After reading "Days and Nights," a battalion commander of a unit in the East China Military Region said: "This book not only teaches us to fight bravely, but also gives me a deeper understanding of strategy and tactics." Many newly enlisted educated youths unanimously expressed after reading "The Young Guard": If the imperialists dare to invade our great motherland, we will definitely fight the invaders to the end like the Young Guard.

    Chinese students have also extensively discussed these works. The heroic images of Oleg and others in "The Young Guard" have become shining examples for them. Encouraged by these moving stories, they have organized combat teams named after "Paul Korchagin," "Oleg," and "Zoya," and enthusiastically responded to the call of the motherland to participate in national defense construction.

    Similarly, books and periodicals from New China are also warmly welcomed by the broad working people in the Soviet Union, and these books and periodicals are often in short supply. For example, the number of "Chinese Workers" pictorial magazines exported to the Soviet Union has been increasing continuously. On March 29 last year, the Soviet Labor Newspaper published a long article entitled "The Heroic Chinese Working Class in Struggle and Labor," which commented: "...The Chinese Workers pictorial magazine will enable Soviet readers to understand the life and labor achievements of the heroic Chinese working class, which will benefit the further consolidation of the unbreakable Sino-Soviet friendship and the consolidation of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism."

    On August 22 last year, "Pravda" published an article by Kovalev recommending the Russian version of "People's China." He said: "Every issue of 'People's China' is praised by the broad Soviet public. The introduction of the lives and struggles of the Chinese people in this magazine helps to consolidate the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the people of the two great powers, China and the Soviet Union."

    Other periodicals and books are also loved and highly praised by Soviet readers.

    Chairman Mao's "On Practice" is often quoted in Soviet schools, books, and periodicals when discussing issues of understanding, practice, and reasoning. A philosopher said: It is rare for someone like Mao Zedong to write about the complex issues of the materialist theory of knowledge with Marx's profound analysis and vivid imagery; "On Practice" has readily solved the question that Soviet philosophical researchers had previously considered, whether the process of understanding includes two stages of perceptual knowledge and rational knowledge.

    In the Soviet Union, Mr. Lu Xun's works are highly praised. In June of last year, "Pravda" published an article by Petrov, reviewing the Russian translation of Lu Xun's short stories and essays. Petrov said: "Lu Xun's writings express his true humanism and his deep sympathy for the oppressed people. His realistic short stories are permeated with love for the people and hatred for the oppressors. These works tell us that Lu Xun is a great and observant writer who brilliantly combines the depth of his works with a high artistic form. Lu Xun is known as the 'Gorky of China,' and it is entirely appropriate to compare him with the creator of socialist realist literature."

    Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River" was praised by Koshevnikov, editor-in-chief of the Soviet magazine "Banner," as a novel of world significance, and meetings were held among workers and students in the Soviet Union to discuss it. They all love this book and love the heroic characters in the book.

    In addition, Zhao Shuli's "Changes in Li Village," Yuan Jing and Kong Jue's "Heroes and Heroines," He Jingzhi's and others' "The White-Haired Girl," and other works have also been unanimously praised by the Soviet people.

    (II)

    The Soviet Union has published many Russian books introducing various aspects of China and Russian translations of Chinese works. The Soviet people regard this work as one of the important ways to consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship.

    In the past two years, the following books have been published or are about to be published in the Soviet Union:

    (1) Philosophy: Mao Zedong's "On Practice," and "The Ancient Chinese Philosopher Lao Tzu and His Theories" by the Soviet philosopher Yang Xingshun, who also re-translated Lao Tzu's "Tao Te Ching."

    (2) Politics: The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, documents and materials on the founding of the People's Republic of China, Liu Shaoqi's "On Internationalism and Nationalism," Chen Boda's "Public Enemy Chiang Kai-shek," and Wu Xiuquan's speech at the United Nations Security Council accusing the United States of armed aggression against Taiwan, etc.

    (3) History: Modern and contemporary Chinese history translated from Chinese. Written by Soviet writers: Karamusha's "The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," Yermashev's "Light Shines on China," Wang Yinting's "The Chinese Communist Party's Struggle for National Independence and Democracy," Nikiforov, George Elenberg, and Yuriev's "The Revolution of the Chinese People," Yefimov's "The Struggle of Chinese Democratic Forces Against Reactionary Forces," George Elenberg's "Anthology of the National Liberation Struggle of the Modern Chinese People," Yurev's "The Historically Significant Victory of the Chinese People Against American Imperialism and the Kuomintang Reactionaries," and Kuznetsov's "The People's Republic of China – The Great Victory of the Chinese People." The Institute of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has also completed a "History of the Economic and Political Development of China." These books respectively elaborate in detail on the Chinese people's various revolutionary struggles under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the factors of the Chinese people's revolutionary victory, the brilliant achievements in various aspects of construction after the founding of New China, and the international status of New China.

    (4) Biography: "Biography of Mao Zedong," "Biography of Mao Zedong and Zhu De," etc.

    (5) Travelogues: Already published are Simonov's "Fighting China" (in Russian and Ukrainian), a long impression piece introducing the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The author describes the heroic struggle of the Chinese people with unparalleled joy, especially the long, arduous, and selfless combat life of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    On October 1 the year before last, a book by the famous Soviet painter Fenognov, "In New China," was published in Moscow. This is a collection of paintings and texts depicting the revolutionary history of the Chinese people. The book contains sixty sketches, and the author uses his high artistic skills in the style of Chinese comic strips to depict the various stages of the great revolutionary cause carried out by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, until the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    Also published are Zichitkina's "Liberated China" and Nikitin's "Beijing."

    (6) Language: The Soviet National Foreign Language and National Language Dictionary Publishing House recently published a Russian-Chinese dictionary. The Institute of Oriental Languages of the Soviet Academy of Sciences has begun compiling Chinese language dictionaries and textbooks for higher academic institutions, and a grammar of modern Chinese will also be published.

    (7) Literature and Art: Translated from Chinese and already published are: Lu Xun's novel "Hometown" and other short stories and essays, Ding Ling's "The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River," Zhao Shuli's "Changes in Li Village" and "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," Cao Ming's "Motive Power," Liu Baiyu's "Three Invincible Warriors," Liu Qing's "Grain Planting Record," Zhou Libo's "The Hurricane," Ouyang Shan's "People's Servant," Ma Feng and Xi Rong's "Heroes of Lüliang," Yuan Jing and Kong Jue's "Heroes and Heroines," "Collection of Chinese Short Stories" compiled from the works of Zhao Shuli and ten others, the works of classical poets Bai Juyi and Meng Haoran of the Tang Dynasty, "Collection of Poems of Liberated China," and scripts such as "The White-Haired Girl" and "Red Flag Song."

    Many literary and artistic works introducing or praising New China have also been published.

    National poets from Kyrgyzstan are writing new poems for the Chinese people who are building a new life. In April of last year, the Kyrgyz Writers' Association held a discussion meeting on Toktomushev's "Letter from Kaksa." This poem tells the story of how a Kyrgyz girl fled to China with many of her compatriots in 1916 due to the persecution of the Tsar's autocracy, where they fell into slavery. When the Chinese people rose up to wage a sacred war against the oppressors, the heroine in the poem sent two sons to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    The young Soviet Sinologists Ovchinnikov and Kassis have completed a book entitled "Gorky's Legacy in China." They describe the influence of Gorky's works on the development of progressive Chinese art and literature, especially on Lu Xun.

    In addition, a group of Soviet Sinologists has begun compiling an "Outline of Modern Chinese Literature," which will analyze the current state of Chinese literature since the publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." There will be a special chapter on the role of Chinese literature in the construction of New China.

    In addition to the various publications mentioned above, the All-Union Society for the Dissemination of Political and Scientific Knowledge has also published a series of pamphlets covering everything from the birth of the Chinese Communist Party to the construction achievements after the founding of the People's Republic of China. Moscow Oriental University, the Oriental Department of Leningrad University, and the History Department of Moscow University have all published outlines and handbooks for studying Chinese language, history, and geography.

    Because the advanced experience of the Soviet people is a mirror for the people of New China to draw on in building socialism and creating a rich spiritual culture, China has translated and published more Soviet works on culture, art, science, and philosophy in the past two years. From these works, our people have learned from the Soviet people's advanced experience in various fields, which has enabled our great economic construction work to avoid many detours.

    According to incomplete statistics from the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the General Administration of Publications, by the end of last year, China had translated a total of 2,675 kinds of books related to the Soviet Union, including: 64 kinds of works by Lenin and Stalin, 912 kinds of social sciences (including philosophy), 31 kinds of history, geography, and biographies, 823 kinds of literature and art, 187 kinds of natural sciences, 368 kinds of applied technology, 263 kinds of children's books, and 27 kinds in other areas. According to incomplete statistics from the "National New Book Catalog" compiled and printed by the Book and Periodical Department of the General Administration of Publications, from January to June of last year, there were about 600 kinds of books written by Chinese writers introducing the Soviet Union.

    These books are one of the main tools for understanding the Soviet Union and learning from the Soviet Union, so they have become a valuable spiritual food and a compass for our work progress for the broad masses of the Chinese people.

    (III)

    The exchange of books and periodicals between China and the Soviet Union has made great progress in the short period of more than two years. This kind of development is only possible between nations led by the Communist Party with a common ideal, and this possibility will inevitably expand and consolidate further with the development of our two countries' economies and cultures in various aspects.

    两年多以来中苏书刊的交流
    陈应楠
    中华人民共和国成立和中苏友好同盟互助条约签订后的两年多以来，中苏文化的交流有了很大的成绩，这对于中苏两国人民间的相互了解和友谊，都起了极重要的作用。现将两年多以来文化交流中的书刊交流的情况，分述于后：
    （一）
    两年多来，中苏两国的许多文化机关都建立了密切的联系，经常地互相赠送各种书报刊物。苏联赠送我国文化机关的书刊，仅中苏友好协会总会，到去年十月为止就收到书籍二万九千零二十二册，杂志三万零三百二十三册，俄文报纸十四种，整套图片一千三百套。
    在去年三月间，列宁格勒大学东方学系将该系图书馆收藏的中国十四世纪珍本——一部散失的中国文化重要典籍“永乐大典”十一卷送还我国，充分表现了对我国文化的爱护和尊重。
    我国各科学文化机关，也把各种书刊和各种文化艺术作品赠给苏联文化机关。仅中苏友好协会总会就曾把书刊一万多册分赠给苏联对外文化协会、苏联科学院、苏联作家协会、列宁图书馆、莫斯科大学图书馆等。中国科学院也把二千多册书刊寄赠苏联各科学文化机关。
    国际书店更大量地把苏联的出版物运来我国，把新中国的出版物运销苏联，大大加强了中苏文化的交流。据国际书店总店统计：前年一月到去年六月底苏联供应了我国九百三十六万五千八百四十四册图书，二百六十万六千八百四十七册刊物，一百五十二万一千九百十五张地图画片和唱片；去年一月到八月从中国运销苏联的书刊计有三十八万零二百八十册。
    苏联的出版物在中国受到广大群众的热烈欢迎，并发生了无可比拟的良好影响。
    苏联著名的小说“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“日日夜夜”、“恐惧与无畏”、“真正的人”、“青年近卫军”等，在中国人民志愿军和中国人民解放军中成为指战员们最喜爱的读物，并发生了极大的鼓舞作用。许多人在轻装行军中，除战斗武器外，宁愿丢掉其他衣物，不愿丢弃这些书籍。在医院里，工作人员经常把“钢铁是怎样炼成的”、“真正的人”等小说读给伤员们听。许多伤员在苏联感人事迹的激励下，更加坚定了斗志。华东军区某部队一个营长看完了“日日夜夜”后说：“这本书不仅教育我们要英勇斗争，而且使我对战略战术有了更深的体会。”许多新参军的知识青年看了“青年近卫军”后一致表示：如果帝国主义胆敢侵犯我们伟大的祖国，我们一定像青年近卫军那样和侵略者斗争到底。
    中国的学生们也曾广泛地讨论了这些作品。“青年近卫军”中的奥列格等的英勇形象已成为他们光辉的榜样。他们在这些动人事迹的鼓舞下，曾组织了以“保尔·柯察金”、“奥列格”、“卓娅”等命名的战斗队，踊跃地响应了祖国的号召，参加了国防建设。
    同样地，新中国的书刊在苏联也受到广大劳动人民的热烈欢迎，这些书刊常常是供不应求的。譬如“中国工人”画刊运销苏联的数目就是不断增加的。苏联劳动报在去年三月二十九日以“在斗争中和劳动中的英雄的中国工人阶级”为题发表长文加以评介，这篇文章说：“……中国工人画刊将使苏联读者认识英雄的中国工人阶级的生活和劳动成就，对于牢不可破的中苏友谊的进一步巩固，对于和平民主和社会主义阵营的巩固，均有裨益。”
    去年八月二十二日“真理报”发表了科瓦列夫推荐“人民中国”俄文版的文章。他说：“人民中国”的每一期受到苏联广大的社会人士的赞扬，这本杂志所介绍的中国人民的生活和斗争，有助于中苏两大国人民的牢不可破的永恒友谊日趋巩固。”
    其余的刊物和书籍同样也受到苏联读者的喜爱，和更高的评价。
    毛主席的“实践论”，在苏联学校中、书刊上，在谈论认识、实践和论理的问题时常常引证其中的论断。有一位哲学家说：像毛泽东这样把唯物主义认识论的复杂问题，用马克思的深刻分析和鲜明形象写出来，是罕有的；“实践论”已使苏联哲学研究者以前所考虑的认识过程是否包含感性认识和理性认识两阶段的问题，迎刃而解。
    在苏联，鲁迅先生的作品得到极高的评价。去年六月间“真理报”曾发表了彼得罗夫的文章，评介鲁迅短篇小说和论文集的俄译本。彼得罗夫说：“鲁迅的著作表现了他的真正的人道主义，和他对被压迫人民的深切同情。他的现实主义的短篇小说贯串着对人民的热爱和对压迫者的憎恨。这些作品告诉我们：鲁迅是一位伟大的、善于观察的作家，他把作品的深刻性和高度的艺术形式光辉地结合起来。鲁迅被誉为‘中国的高尔基’，把他和社会主义的现实主义文学的创作者相提并论是完全应当的。”
    丁玲的“太阳照在桑乾河上”一书，曾被苏联“旗帜”杂志主编柯谢夫尼柯夫誉为具有世界意义的小说，在苏联广大的工人和学生中曾开过会来讨论它。他们都爱这本书，热爱书中的英雄人物。
    此外，赵树理的“李家庄的变迁”，袁静、孔厥的“新儿女英雄传”、贺敬之等作的“白毛女”等作品也都受到苏联人民的一致好评。
    （二）
    苏联出版了许多介绍中国各方面的俄文书籍和中国著作的俄译本。苏联人民把这件工作当作巩固中苏友谊的重要方法之一。
    两年多来，苏联国内已出版或即将出版的有下面一些书籍。
    （1）哲学方面：有毛主席的“实践论”，苏联哲学家杨兴顺著的“中国古代哲学家老子及其学说”，作者并把老子“道德经”重新译出。
    （2）政治方面：有中国人民政治协商会议的共同纲领、中华人民共和国成立的文献和资料，刘少奇的“论国际主义与民族主义”，陈伯达著的“人民公敌蒋介石”，伍修权在联合国安理会上控诉美国武装侵略台湾的发言等。
    （3）历史方面：从中文译出的有中国近代史和现代史。由苏联著作家写的，有卡拉慕沙的“太平天国”，叶尔马雪夫的“光明照耀着中国”，汪因庭的“为国家的独立和民主而斗争的中国共产党”，尼基佛罗夫、乔治·爱伦堡和尤里耶夫合著的“中国人民的革命”，叶菲莫夫编写的“中国民主力量反对反动力量的斗争”，乔治·爱伦堡的“近代中国人民民族解放斗争论文集”，尤列夫的“中国人民反对美帝国主义和国民党反动派的历史意义的胜利”，库兹尼佐夫的“中华人民共和国——中国人民的伟大胜利”。苏联科学院东方学研究所也完成了一部“中国经济政治发展史”。这些书籍分别详尽地论述了中国人民在毛主席和中国共产党领导下进行历次革命斗争的情况，中国人民革命胜利的因素，新中国成立后各方面建设的辉煌成就，以及新中国的国际地位。
    （4）传记方面：有“毛泽东传”、“毛泽东、朱德传”等。
    （5）游记方面：已出版了的有西蒙诺夫“战斗的中国”（俄文和乌克兰文），这是一部介绍中国人民解放军的长篇印象记，作者以无比的欢欣叙述了中国人民的英勇斗争，特别是中国人民解放军的长期艰苦、忘我牺牲的战斗生活。
    前年十月一日在莫斯科出版了一本苏联著名画家费诺格诺夫的“在新中国”，这是一本描写中国人民革命历史的画文集。书内有素描六十幅，作者以中国连环画的方式，运用他的高度艺术技巧，描绘了中国人民革命在中国共产党和毛主席、朱总司令领导下所进行的伟大革命事业的各阶段，直到中华人民共和国成立。
    另外还出版了齐契特金娜的“解放了的中国”，尼基丁的“北京”。
    （6）语文方面：苏联国立外国语文和民族语文辞典出版局最近出版了一本俄华辞典。苏联科学院东方语文研究所已着手编纂高等学术机关用的中国语文辞典和教科书，现代中国语文文法也将出版。
    （7）文艺方面：从中文翻译过去并已出版的有：鲁迅的小说“故乡”及其他短篇小说和杂文，丁玲的“太阳照在桑乾河上”，赵树理的“李家庄的变迁”和“小二黑结婚”，草明的“原动力”，刘白羽的“无敌三勇士”，柳青的“种谷记”，周立波的“暴风骤雨”，欧阳山的“人民勤务员”，马烽、西戎的“吕梁英雄传”，袁静、孔厥的“新儿女英雄传”，赵树理等十一人作品编成的“中国短篇小说集”，唐代古典诗人白居易和孟浩然的作品，“解放了的中国的诗集”，以及“白毛女”、“红旗歌”等剧本。
    介绍或歌颂新中国的文艺著作也出版了很多。
    吉尔吉斯的民族诗人都为正在建设新生活的中国人民写着新诗。在去年四月间吉尔吉斯作家协会举行了托克托姆雪夫的“来自喀克萨的信”的讨论会。这篇诗叙述了一九一六年一个吉尔吉斯的姑娘由于沙皇的专制的迫害，如何跟许多同胞逃亡到中国，在那里陷于奴隶的地位。当中国人民奋起进行反对压迫者的神圣战争的时候，诗中的女主角把两个儿子送进中国人民解放军。
    苏联年轻的汉学家奥夫契尼科夫和卡西斯完成了一部“高尔基的遗产在中国”的著作。他们叙述了高尔基的作品对中国进步艺术文学的发展，特别是对于鲁迅的影响。
    此外，苏联一批汉学家已着手编纂一部“现代中国文学概论”，该书将分析毛主席的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”发表以来，中国文学的现状。其中专有一章论述中国文学在新中国建设中的作用。
    除了以上所述的各种出版物外，全苏政治与科学知识普及协会也出版了一系列的小册子，内容包括中国共产党的诞生一直到中华人民共和国成立后的建设成就。莫斯科东方大学、列宁格勒大学东方系、莫斯科大学历史系都出版了研究中国语文和史地的纲要手册。
    由于苏联人民的先进经验，是新中国人民吸取社会主义建设经验、创造丰富的精神文化的借镜。两年多来，中国翻译和出版了更多的苏联文化、艺术、科学、哲学等著作，从这些作品中，我国人民学习到苏联人民在各方面的先进经验，使我们伟大的经济建设工作少走了许多弯路。
    据出版总署编译局不完全统计，到去年年底，我国翻译了有关苏联的书籍共有二千六百七十五种，计：列宁、斯大林著作六十四种，社会科学（包括哲学）九百十二种，史地人物三十一种，文艺八百二十三种，自然科学一百八十七种，应用技术三百六十八种，少年儿童读物二百六十三种，其他方面的二十七种。中国作家编写有关介绍苏联的书籍，根据出版总署图书期刊司编印的“全国新书目录”不完全统计，从去年一月到六月，约有六百余种。
    这些书籍是认识苏联、学习苏联的主要工具之一，所以它已成为广大中国人民宝贵的精神食粮，我们工作上前进的指南针。
    （三）
    中苏两国书刊的交流，在这两年多的短促时间里，有了巨大的发展。这种发展，只有在共产党领导下，有着共同理想的民族之间才有可能，而这种可能也必将随着我们两国经济、文化各方面的发展而更加扩大，更加巩固。
