Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 14th: This reporter reports: On the 13th, our liaison officer, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunshan, met with the U.S. liaison officer, Mr. Murray, to bring to the attention of the other party the violations of the agreement, specifically two U.S. aircraft flying over the Panmunjom conference area at 8:30 a.m. on the 13th, and a U.S. aircraft flying low over the Kaesong neutral zone at 9:40 p.m. on the 12th.

Since the U.S. aircraft bombing of the Kaesong neutral zone on January 17th, up to February 13th, in these 28 days, our side has already called the U.S. side's attention to as many as 23 incidents of U.S. aircraft violating the agreement. This includes one instance of U.S. aircraft bombing the Kaesong neutral zone, one instance of U.S. aircraft bombing and strafing the Korean-Chinese delegation convoy, three instances of U.S. aircraft flying over the Panmunjom conference area, and eighteen instances of U.S. aircraft flying over the Kaesong neutral zone. It is worth noting that despite our side's repeated reminders and protests, the U.S. side's behavior in violating the agreement has not decreased but has instead increased and continued endlessly. This demonstrates how the U.S. side is fulfilling the understanding that they personally signed and publicly declared they would strictly abide by.

    美机继续破坏中立区协议
    我方提起美方注意
    【新华社开城十四日电】本社记者报道：十三日我方联络官张春山上校与美方联络官穆莱会晤，就十三日晨八时三十分美机两架飞越板门店会场区，及十二日夜九时四十分美机一架在开城中立区上空低飞的破坏协议的事件提起对方注意。
    自一月十七日美机轰炸开城中立区事件以来，到二月十三日为止的二十八天中，仅已由我方提起美方注意的美机破坏协议行为就有二十三次之多，包括美机轰炸开城中立区一次、美机轰炸扫射朝中代表团车队一次、美机飞越板门店会场区上空三次、美机飞越开城中立区上空十八次。值得注意的是：美方此种破坏协议的行为，虽经我方一再提醒及抗议，却仍有增无减，层出不穷。这就说明了美方对他们亲手签字并公开声明要严格遵守的谅解是如何履行的。
