On the Front Lines of the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy

Following the Beijing Public Trial of Major Embezzlers, Corruptionists in Various Units of the Ministry of Trade Confess One After Another

The corrupt elements in various units under the Central People's Government's Ministry of Trade have been confessing one after another after attending the Beijing public trial of major embezzlers. As of the evening of the 2nd, within a day and a half, thirteen people newly confessed to acts of corruption, forty-three people supplemented their confessions of corrupt acts, and ten major embezzlers supplemented their explanations of important issues. Some corrupt elements felt that "as long as they confess, there is a way out." Others recognized that "not confessing is not an option." An individual unit discovered a major case of collective corruption before the conference, but these corrupt elements refused to confess. After attending the conference, they began to confess their own problems, and some even revealed that they had sold important economic intelligence.

The general cadres and masses of the Ministry of Trade who attended the Beijing public trial of major embezzlers believe that postponing the confession deadline to February 15th is leniency towards corrupt elements; the handling of the seven major embezzlers clearly pointed out the path that corrupt elements should take. If corrupt elements do not confess any further, they are heading down a dead end. Now, the vast majority of workers in the Ministry of Trade are even more determined to thoroughly eliminate corrupt elements.

Leading Cadres of the Ningxia Provincial Party Committee Did Not Go to the "Front Line"

The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Ningxia's provincial-level organs has not yet created a large-scale, vigorous momentum. Not many problems have been discovered, especially the exposure of major corruption cases is very incomplete. Some of the masses still have concerns and dare not boldly confess and report. Individual leading cadres of organs still adopt a resistant and passive attitude towards the movement. The main reasons for this phenomenon are: (1) Several main leading cadres of the CPC Ningxia Provincial Committee did not personally go to the "front line." Since the beginning of the movement, the Ningxia Provincial Committee has not convened a single conference of party member cadres from provincial-level organs, but only individual leading cadres have spoken several times at small-scale meetings. Therefore, some cadres below believe that the Provincial Committee is not determined to fight corruption and are afraid that problems cannot be resolved after they are exposed. (2) Leading cadres who suppressed democracy, resisted the anti-corruption movement, and adopted a passive and slack attitude towards the movement have not been dealt with in a timely manner. During the movement, many incidents of leading cadres suppressing democracy and being passive and slack occurred in Ningxia Province. Except for a few organs that have made preliminary handling, most organs have adopted a policy of appeasement. (3) Key organs were not grasped. Instead of focusing on financial and economic enterprise organs, it was planned to focus on the Department of Culture and Education, the Bureau of Water Conservancy, and Yinchuan City, but in fact, the Provincial Thrift Inspection Committee did not specifically inspect and assist these three "key points." The movement in these three "key points" has not been well developed either.

In the Struggle Against Corruption and Waste, Propagandists in Shenyang and Other Places Have Played a Significant Role

At the beginning of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, Harbin Municipal Committee, Anshan Municipal Committee, and Lushun-Dalian Municipal Committee all convened various meetings of propagandists to deploy propaganda work on the anti-corruption and waste movement. Now, the propaganda activities of reporters and propagandists in various places have achieved preliminary results. Liu Wentao, a propagandist from the material section of a factory in Shenyang City, actively carried out propaganda activities and led the masses to find that the purchasing section bought ball bearings that were fourteen hundred million off of the books in one month. A propagandist from Tao Guan Street in Anshan City went deep into the residents' groups to carry out propaganda, so that 75% of the households on this street were educated in the anti-corruption and waste movement, driving the masses to expose corrupt elements. Party reporters and propagandists in various places should actively take action to thoroughly publicize the great political significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle to cadres and the masses, and resolutely open fire on the corrupt ideas and behaviors of the bourgeoisie.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    参加北京公审大贪污犯大会后贸易部各单位贪污分子纷纷坦白
    中央人民政府贸易部所属各单位的贪污分子，在参加北京公审大贪污犯大会后，纷纷进行坦白。截至二日晚一天半内，新坦白有贪污行为者十三人，补充坦白贪污行为者四十三人，有十名大贪污犯补充交代了重要问题。有的贪污分子感到“只要坦白，就有出路。”有的认识到“不说是不行的”。个别单位在大会前发现了集体贪污巨案，但这些贪污分子拒不坦白，参加大会后即开始交代自己的问题，有的并说出曾出卖过重要经济情报。
    贸易部参加北京公审大贪污犯大会的一般干部群众，认为推迟坦白截止期至二月十五日，是对贪污分子的宽大；对七个大贪污犯的处理，是给贪污分子明确地指出了应走的道路。如果贪污分子再不坦白，那就是自走绝路。现在贸易部广大的工作人员对彻底肃清贪污分子更有决心。
    宁夏省委负责干部没有“上前线”
    宁夏省级机关反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动还没有造成大张旗鼓、雷厉风行的声势。已发现的问题不多，特别是大贪污案件暴露的很不彻底。部分群众仍有顾虑，不敢大胆地坦白和检举。个别机关的负责干部仍对运动采取抗拒和消极态度。造成这种现象的主要原因是：（一）中共宁夏省委几个主要负责干部没有亲自“上前线”。自运动开始以来，宁夏省委没有召开过一次省级机关的党员干部大会，只是个别负责干部在小型的会议上讲了几次。因此，下面有些干部认为省委对反贪污运动没有决心，唯恐暴露问题后不能得到解决。（二）对压制民主、抗拒反贪污运动和对运动采取消极怠工的负责干部，没有及时进行处理。在运动中，宁夏省曾发生许多领导干部压制民主和消极怠工的现象，除个别机关作过初步处理外，大部分机关采取了姑息态度。（三）没有抓住重点机关。不是以财经企业机关为重点，而计划以文教厅、水利局、银川市为重点，但实际上，省节约检查委员会对这三个重点也没有具体检查和帮助。这三个“重点”的运动也没有很好地展开。
    在反贪污、反浪费的斗争中沈阳等地宣传员起作用很大
    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始时，中共沈阳市委、哈尔滨市委、鞍山市委、旅大市委都分别召开了宣传员的各种会议，布置关于反贪污浪费运动的宣传工作。现在各地报告员和宣传员的宣传活动，已有初步成效。沈阳市某工厂材料股宣传员刘文涛，积极进行宣传活动，带领群众在账上查出购置科买滚球，一个月就差了十四亿元。鞍山市陶官街宣传员深入居民小组进行宣传，使这条街百分之七十五的住户受到反贪污浪费运动的教育，带动群众起来检举贪污分子。各地党的报告员和宣传员都应积极行动起来，向干部、群众深入地宣传反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的伟大政治意义，向资产阶级腐败的思想和行为坚决地开火。
