    Celebrating the Second Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with More Heroic Battles
    Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Volunteers, Guo Zhongtian
    In the winter of 1950, when the American aggressors were frantically advancing towards the Yalu River, threatening the independence of Korea, the security of our motherland, and peace in the Far East, we began to go to Korea to punish the aggressors. I still clearly remember the battle at Gehyeon Mountain near Longyuanli. At that time, the American invading army's Eighth Army was fleeing south in a panic. A certain unit of our army bypassed the enemy's rear with incredible speed, suddenly appearing on the line of Sansuoli and Longyuanli south of Gunuri, blocking the offensive of tens of thousands of fleeing enemies with a small force. In order to open a path for escape, the enemy concentrated its forces and firepower to pounce on our positions. On the narrow 300-meter position on Gehyeon Mountain, defended by our platoon, thousands of bombs and shells fell in one day. Hundreds of planes flew low over our heads, strafing. Gasoline bombs scorched the positions. The enemy's artillery fire and machine guns leveled the dense dwarf pine forest. After that, more than 300 American soldiers launched three consecutive assaults. But dozens of us stood firm on the position. In front of our position, there were more than 200 enemy corpses that they had no time to drag away. Finally, we and our friendly neighboring units victoriously launched a counterattack. Our soldiers are heroically invincible in the great cause of defending the motherland and defending world peace. This is because we deeply understand that American imperialism is the mortal enemy of peace-loving people. We know that the Korean people and the people of our motherland are fully supporting us; at the same time, we know that standing with us are hundreds of millions of people in the world peace and democracy camp, headed by the great Soviet Union. This great support is the source of boundless courage and strength for us in the most urgent and difficult times in battle.
    In August 1951, I accompanied the Chinese Youth Delegation to Berlin to attend the World Youth and Student Peace Festival and visited our great ally, the Soviet Union. This made me personally experience the will and strength of people all over the world to defend peace even further.
    In the Soviet Union, I saw the great Soviet people building the beautiful cause of a communist society with their outstanding labor and wisdom, and they were all so concerned about the happiness and peace of the people of the world. The love, care, and incomparably close friendship of the Soviet people for the Chinese people that I personally felt cannot be described in words. I met many Soviet Red Army commanders and fighters in the Soviet Union. The bravery they showed in defeating German fascism and Japanese imperialism aroused my infinite admiration. Similarly, they also expressed heartfelt praise and concern for the great movement of resisting America and aiding Korea by the Chinese people. A Red Army commander who had performed meritorious service in the Soviet Patriotic War warmly received me. He had been wounded seven times on the battlefield. He had fought in Northeast China to finally defeat the Japanese bandits, and he still wore a medal commemorating the liberation of Northeast China. He was already in his thirties, but he looked very young in front of me. We met like brothers who had been separated for a long time.
    Seeing such a great and loyal Soviet ally, our courage in battle is even higher!
    Now, as we commemorate the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, American imperialism is preparing new conspiracies to expand its war of aggression in the Far East. Those American war-mongers and Japanese reactionaries should be told: The power of the Chinese and Soviet people united is invincible. In the face of the great unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, any aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism is bound to fail. We, the Chinese People's Volunteers standing on the front lines of resisting America and aiding Korea, vow to celebrate the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance with even more heroic battles.

    以更英勇的战斗来庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年
    中国人民志愿军战斗英雄  郭忠田
    一九五○年冬天，当美国侵略者疯狂地向鸭绿江边进攻，威胁到朝鲜的独立、祖国的安全与远东的和平的时候，我们开始到朝鲜去惩罚侵略者。我还清楚地记得在龙源里附近的葛岘山作战的情景。当时美国侵略军第八军仓惶向南逃窜，我军某部以神奇的速度迂回到敌后，突然出现在军隅里以南三所里和龙源里一线，以少数兵力阻击数万逃敌的进攻。敌人为了打开逃路，曾集中兵力、火力向我阵地猛扑。我们一排人扼守的葛岘山上三百公尺的狭小阵地上，在一天之内，就落下了数千颗炸弹和炮弹。成百架飞机在头上低飞扫射。汽油弹把阵地烧焦了。敌人的炮火和机关枪，把密茂的矮松林削平了。在这之后，三百多名美国兵连续发动三次冲击。可是我们几十个人屹立在阵地上，在我们的阵地面前，敌人来不及拖走而丢下的死尸就有两百多具。最后我们和友邻部队胜利地发起了反击。我们的战士，在保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的伟大事业中，是英勇无敌的。这是因为我们深深地理解到美帝国主义是和平人民的死敌。我们知道朝鲜人民和祖国人民是在全力支援着我们；同时我们知道，站在我们一道的还有以伟大的苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的几万万人民。这种伟大的支援，就是我们在战斗中最紧急最困难的时候给我们无限的勇气和力量源泉。
    一九五一年八月，我曾随中国青年代表团，到柏林参加世界青年与学生和平联欢节，并且访问了我们的伟大盟邦苏联。这使我更进一步亲身体会到了全世界人民保卫和平的意志和力量。
    在苏联，我看到了伟大的苏联人民正以他们杰出的劳动与智慧在建设着共产主义社会的美好事业，他们都是那么关切着世界人民的幸福与和平。我所亲身感受到的苏联人民对中国人民的热爱、关怀和亲密无比的友谊，是不能用言语形容的。我在苏联会见了许多苏联红军的指挥员和战斗员。他们在击溃德国法西斯和日本帝国主义的战争中所表现的英勇，引起了我无限的敬仰。同样地，他们对中国人民的抗美援朝伟大运动也表示了衷心的称赞和关切。一位在苏联卫国战争中立过功勋的红军指挥官热烈地招待了我。他曾经在战场上负过七次伤。他曾为最后打垮日本强盗而到中国东北作过战，他的胸前还挂着解放中国东北的纪念章。他的年纪已经三十多岁了，可是在我的面前显得非常年轻，我们见面就像久别的兄弟一样。
    看到这样一个伟大的、忠实的苏联盟友，我们在战斗中的勇气是更加高昂了！
    现在，当我们纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年的时候，美国帝国主义在远东正在准备扩大侵略战争的新阴谋。应该告诉那些美国的战争贩子和日本反动派们：中苏两国人民团结起来的力量是无敌的。在中苏两国人民伟大团结的面前，美国帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋必然失败。我们站在抗美援朝最前线的中国人民志愿军，誓以更英勇的战斗来庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约缔结两周年。（附图片）
