    Shandong Office of the East China Industrial Department
    Should Investigate Corruption and Waste at Shandong Ceramics General Factory

    To the Editor: There is serious corruption and waste at the Boshan State-owned Shandong Ceramics General Factory. From December 1951 to the present, the average scrap rate of the factory's nine kilns is over 60%, resulting in a loss of more than 300 million yuan. The scrap rate of high-voltage electrical porcelain blanks they produce is about 30%, and the scrap rate after firing is over 40%, sometimes reaching as high as 80%. Last year, they contracted to produce large double insulators for the Central Postal and Telecommunications Department Supply Bureau, and more than 100,000 pieces were scrapped, resulting in a loss of more than 500 million yuan in state assets. The factory also engages in blind production, accumulating capital. For example, last year, they accumulated more than 8,000 metric tons of refractory bricks (including silica bricks), making nearly 4 billion yuan of capital unable to circulate. Conversely, they produce too little of "acid-resistant containers" and "fuse porcelain boxes," which are urgently needed for national construction and which they have a large production capacity for, which is also a form of waste. There are also many other wastes, such as rework waste during the construction of the powdered stone kiln, and waste in management. The cause of these wastes is the bureaucratic work style of the factory's administrative leaders. They sit in their offices all day issuing orders, without going down to investigate and research, and without adopting the opinions of the workers. Some technicians are irresponsible in their work, believing that producing defective products is a minor matter; administrative leaders do not correct this either. Shandong Dazhong Daily has criticized the factory's waste before, but the factory's leadership has paid no attention to it. Today, as the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is being carried out, the factory's waste has not only not decreased, but has become even more serious. I request that the Shandong Office of the East China Industrial Department quickly send someone to investigate.

    华东工业部山东办事处
    应检查山东窑业总厂的贪污浪费现象
    编辑同志：博山国营山东窑业总厂有严重的贪污浪费现象。从一九五一年十二月到现在，该厂九个瓷窑的平均废品率在百分之六十以上，损失三亿多元。他们所出产的高压电瓷的坯子，废品率约百分之三十，烧出后的废品率在百分之四十以上，最多时竟达百分之八十；他们去年承制中央邮电部供应局大型双重绝缘子，就有废品十万多个，损失国家资财五亿多元。该厂还盲目生产，积压资金。如去年一年中，共积压了耐火砖（包括矽砖）八千多公吨，使将近四十亿元的资金不能周转。与此相反，他们对国家建设急需而自己又具有大量生产能力的“耐酸容器”“保险瓷盒”等，却生产太少，这也是一种浪费。其他如建设粉石窑时的返工浪费，以及管理方面的浪费，也是很多的。产生这些浪费的原因是该厂行政领导干部的官僚主义作风。他们成天坐在办公室里发号施令，不到下面调查研究，不采纳工人的意见。有些技术人员对工作不负责任，认为出废品是小事；行政领导干部也不予以纠正。山东大众日报曾先后批评过该厂的浪费，但该厂的领导方面却对此毫不注意。在开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的今天，该厂的浪费现象不但没有减少，反而更厉害起来。我要求华东工业部山东办事处迅速派人前往检查。  鲁华  高玮
