    Shanghai Bank Head Office Union Eighth Group
    Suggests the People's Government Punish Zi Yaohua

    To the Editor: After seeing the news in the February 3rd People's Daily about the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion struggle in Tianjin's financial industry, and that Zi Yaohua's confession was incomplete and aroused public indignation, our entire group immediately launched a discussion. Everyone believes that Zi Yaohua was a "politician" in the financial industry in the past. After liberation, he pretended to be active and, under the guise of a national bourgeois, got the position of manager of the Tianjin branch of the Shanghai Bank. However, his behavior was very bad. He consistently used his position in politics and the financial industry to oppose the people through illegal means such as deception, coercion, and using public office for private gain. In this movement, despite repeated enlightenment and education from relevant parties hoping he would thoroughly confess, he still avoided the important and dwelled on the trivial, his attitude was extremely dishonest, and he even resisted the movement. We firmly support the People's Government in exposing all his illegal facts and suggest giving him the punishment he deserves, removing illegal elements from state capitalist enterprises (the Shanghai Bank was reorganized into a joint public-private enterprise last November), and clearing obstacles to improve our enterprise. We believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement will surely achieve complete victory.

    上海银行总管理处工会第八小组
    建议人民政府惩办资耀华
    编辑同志：我们看到二月三日人民日报所载天津市金融业展开反行贿反偷税斗争，资耀华坦白不彻底引起公愤的消息后，全小组立即展开讨论。大家认为：资耀华过去是一个金融业中的“政客”。解放后，他伪装积极，并以民族资产阶级的身份，混上了天津市上海银行经理的职位。但是，他的作风非常恶劣。他一贯利用在政治上和金融业中的地位，以欺骗、胁迫、假公济私等不法手段与人民为敌。在这次运动中，虽经有关方面对他反复启发教育，希望他彻底坦白，可是他还是避重就轻，态度极不老实，甚至抗拒运动。我们坚决拥护人民政府揭露他的各项违法事实，并建议给予应得的处分，清除国家资本主义性质企业（上海银行在去年十一月改组为公私合营）内的不法分子，为搞好我们的企业，扫除障碍。我们相信，在毛主席和中国共产党领导下，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动一定能够获得彻底胜利。
