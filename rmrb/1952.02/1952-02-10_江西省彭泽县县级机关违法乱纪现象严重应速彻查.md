    Serious Violations of Law and Discipline by County-Level Organs in Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, Should Be Thoroughly Investigated Immediately

    Editor: I used to be the secretary and head of the Culture and Education Section of the People's Government of Pengze County, Jiangxi Province. I am now studying at the Central School for Political and Legal Cadres. In the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, in addition to making a profound self-criticism of my mistakes—which were simply crimes—I want to expose the illegal and undisciplined behavior of the county-level organs in Pengze County.

    1.  Withholding and Embezzling Various Enterprise Grains. In 1950, the Civil Affairs Section received 130,000 jin of disaster relief grain (rice), but only 90,000 jin were actually distributed. The remaining 40,000 jin were used to offset the previous overspending of the Construction Section on dike construction, and 20,000 jin were used as loan grain for dike construction. When the higher authorities urged a report on the disaster relief grain, the county sent Fei Yiliang, a staff member of the Civil Affairs Section (a retained personnel), to various villages to deceive the masses into putting their fingerprints on the disaster relief grain receipt roster, which was counted as a "voucher" for reporting the disaster relief grain. Later, the Construction Section reported the dike construction grain and returned 20,000 jin to the Civil Affairs Section. The Construction Section falsely reported and embezzled more than 20,000 jin of rice for enterprise expenses and accumulated more than 10 million yuan in enterprise expenses that were not reported. In 1949, the Culture and Education Section withheld teachers' salaries and other enterprise expenses, accumulating 11,000 jin of rice. In 1950, it received more than 50,000 jin of grain from school land, but only reported more than 20,000 jin, hiding 30,000 jin. It withheld 29,000 jin of subsidized grain for people-run and government-assisted primary schools (received 30,000 jin, but only distributed 1,000 jin). When reporting, it mobilized the principals of various central schools and primary school teachers to write false receipts. In 1951, the county falsely reported a county people's representative meeting and embezzled about 2,000 jin of rice for expenses. The summary of the production meeting was modified and used as the summary of the people's representative meeting, and the false expense vouchers were fabricated by the Finance Section. In 1950, the county withheld more than 5,000 jin of grain for the spring plowing survey expenses (actually received 12,000 jin, spent more than 6,000 jin). When County Head Fang Shucai sent me to ask the district chiefs to write false receipts, the district chiefs refused. They only agreed after being treated to a meal. The county people's court never spent enterprise funds. It found merchants to create false vouchers or borrowed vouchers from the secretary's office to falsely report more than 5 million yuan of enterprise funds to the higher authorities. It spent about 1 million yuan on buying tables and chairs, and the remaining 4 million yuan was lent to the organs for production at a monthly interest rate of 1%.

    2.  Withholding Various Fiscal Revenues. In 1950, the county over-collected more than 700,000 jin of public grain. More than 300,000 jin were used to offset other grains, and the remaining more than 300,000 jin were reported to the commissioner's office. The Jiujiang Commissioner's Office instructed, "Don't report to the province, we will allocate a portion to you later." The Finance Section advocated reporting all the 8 to 9 million yuan of afforestation fees collected, but the county head insisted on withholding a portion. The exact amount withheld is unknown. The county confiscated 2,000 fir trees acquired by private merchants, worth more than 20 million yuan. When the commissioner's office heard about this, it asked the county to report it. The county government reported: "Only 7 to 8 hundred trees were confiscated, and their value is not enough to cover the cost of transporting them to the riverside." The commissioner's office did not pursue the matter further, and the county withheld all of them. In addition, there were withholdings in the collection of public grain, land tax substitutes, and firewood substitutes in 1949 and 1950. The figures are unknown.

    3.  Illegal Aspects of Engaging in Organ Production. From the winter of 1949 to the end of 1950, the fir wood station was operated, using about 100,000 jin of public grain as capital. The county did not allow the masses to cut down trees, but the fir wood station cut down trees for business. In the spring of 1951, after the fir wood station stopped cutting down trees, it purchased old fir wood stored by the masses and sold it to the Construction Section for flood control, with the profit considered as organ production income (the fir wood station earned a total of 100 to 200 million yuan). To open a dyeing and weaving factory, it was necessary to obtain a loan from the bank, but according to regulations, it could not be lent. The bank manager said, "You can find a private merchant to borrow in their name." Later, I found the director of the Chamber of Commerce and another private merchant. One provided the name, and the other provided a guarantee, fraudulently obtaining a bank loan of 10 million yuan. The county sold a steamboat at the bottom of the Yangtze River (expressly forbidden to salvage sunken ships privately) to a private merchant for 30 million yuan. The county government and the public security bureau each received 15 million yuan. The county sent five cadres to engage in trade, selling 90,000 jin of charcoal and stealing 40,000 jin of agricultural loan grain in Nanjing. The five cadres "played with girls" as soon as they left, embezzling more than 3 million yuan in public funds in just over three months. Private individuals were not allowed to invest in organ production, but the deputy director of the Civil Affairs Section (County Head's wife, He Shuhua) invested more than 1 million yuan in organ production and made a profit of 500,000 yuan in four months.

    4.  The County Government and County Committee Each Built a Large Building. The County Government originally prepared a budget of more than 100 million yuan, but Shi Ziming, the commissioner of the Jiujiang Commissioner's Office, thought it was too low and doubled the price of the materials, revising the budget to more than 200 million yuan. The provincial government only approved a total of 120 million yuan for the County Government and the County Committee. The County Government and the County Committee each received 60 million yuan. The County Government building cost 150 million yuan (the timber was cut from the mountains and not included in the calculation), illegally misappropriating 30,000 jin of civil affairs enterprise grain and 10,000 jin of construction enterprise grain in addition to using 30,000 jin of over-collected public grain as "reward grain." The new building of the County Committee is similar to the County Government building. The County Public Security Bureau also built a building for itself, and the expenditure situation also needs to be checked. When the County Committee was building the building, because the contractor could not purchase cement, it deceived the higher authorities by falsely claiming to be purchasing 8,000 jin of cement in the name of repairing a sluice.

    5.  Due to the large-scale construction by county-level organs and enterprises, six or seventy households were "mobilized" to move. The prices of private houses were discounted cheaply. For example, when the County Committee was building the building, more than 20 households were "mobilized" to move. The houses were only valued at about 20 or 30 shi of rice, but the income from demolishing bricks alone was worth 60 or 70 shi of rice.

    In short, the illegal and undisciplined behavior of our county-level organs in Pengze County, led by the County Committee, has reached an intolerable level. They have no concept of the state or the people at all, and they have turned all the state's financial systems into items for withholding, false reporting, and embezzlement. In order to satisfy their own desire for enjoyment, they disregard the lives and deaths of the people. For example, the County Committee "mobilized" residents to move when building the building, not because the foundation was insufficient, but because the private houses were in front of the building, preventing it from appearing in its entirety and displaying its grandeur. The situations I have exposed are only part of the problem. I hope that the Pengze County-level leading organs will conduct a thorough inspection and make a public self-criticism. And please ask the Jiangxi Provincial leading organs to directly send people to Pengze County for strict inspection.

    Editor's Note: The phenomenon of violations of law and discipline by county-level organs in Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, is serious. The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government should conduct an in-depth inspection and handling.

### 江西省彭泽县县级机关违法乱纪现象严重应速彻查

    江西省彭泽县县级机关违法乱纪现象严重应速彻查
    编辑同志：我原在江西省彭泽县人民政府担任秘书兼文教科科长，现在中央政法干部学校学习。在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动中，我除了对我的错误——简直是罪恶——作深刻的检讨外，我要检举彭泽县县级机关的违法乱纪行为。
    一、克扣冒领各种事业粮。一九五○年民政科领来十三万斤救灾粮（大米），实发九万斤，其余四万斤，二万斤抵补了以前建设科修堤超支，二万斤作为修堤贷粮。上级催报救灾粮时，县里就派民政科科员费义良（留用人员）到各村欺骗群众在领救灾粮名册上按指印，算作报销救灾粮的“单据”。以后建设科曾把修堤粮上报，已归还民政科二万斤。建设科虚报冒领事业费粮二万多斤米，并积余事业费一千多万元未上报。文教科在一九四九年克扣教员薪金及其他事业费积余一万一千斤米；一九五○年收入学田粮五万多斤，只上报二万多斤，打埋伏三万斤；克扣民办公助小学补助粮二万九千斤（领米三万斤，实发一千斤），报销时动员各中心学校校长和小学教员写假领条。一九五一年县里虚报县人民代表会议一次，冒领经费米约二千斤，把生产会议的总结修改了一下，当作人民代表会议的总结，经费开支的假单据由财政科编造。一九五○年县里克扣春耕调查经费粮五千多斤（实领一万二千斤，开支六千多斤），县长方述才派我找各区区长写假领条时，区长们不干，经过请客才答应写。县人民法院从来没有开支过事业费，找商人造假单据或从秘书室借单据向上级虚报冒领事业费五百多万元，买桌椅开支约一百万元，其余四百万元以月息一分的利息贷给机关生产。
    二、克扣各种财政收入。一九五○年县里超征公粮七十多万斤，除三十多万斤抵其他粮外，余三十多万斤报专署。九江专署指示“别往省报告，以后我们分给你们一部分。”财政科主张把征收的育林费八、九百万元全部上报，但县长却主张克扣一部分，究竟克扣多少，不详。县里没收私商收购的杉木二千根，价值二千多万元，专署听说这件事，要县上报，县政府报告说：“只没收了七、八百根，其价值尚不敷运到河边运费的开支。”专署后来不再追问，县里就全部扣下了。此外，在一九四九年与一九五○年征收之公粮田赋代金、柴草代金都有克扣现象，数字不详。
    三、搞机关生产的非法部分。一九四九年冬至一九五○年底经营杉木站，动用公粮约十多万斤作资金。县里不准群众砍伐林木，杉木站却砍伐林木作生意。一九五一年春，杉木站停止砍伐林木后，又收购群众旧存杉木，卖给建设科作防汛用，赚钱算是机关生产收入（杉木站共赚了一亿至二亿元）。开办染织厂，要从银行贷款，按规定不能贷给。银行经理说：“你们可以找私商顶名贷”，后由我找商联会主任，又找一户私商，一个出名，一个担保，骗取银行贷款一千万元。县里把长江水底轮船一艘
    （明令禁止不准私捞沉船）卖给私商，得款三千万元，县政府、公安局各分得一千五百万元。县里派五个干部跑行商，到南京出售木炭九万斤，盗卖农贷粮四万斤，五个干部一出门即“玩姑娘”，来往三个多月，盗用公款三百多万元。机关生产中不准私人入股，民政科副科长（县长的爱人何淑华）却在机关生产中投资一百多万元，四个月得利五十万元。
    四、县政府、县委员会各修大楼一所。县政府原编造预算一亿多元，九江专署专员史梓铭嫌编得少，把材料价格提高一倍，改编预算为两亿多元。省府只批准县府、县委共一亿二千万元。县府和县委各分得六千万元。县政府大楼开支一亿五千万元（木料是从山上砍伐，未计在内），除用超征公粮“奖励粮”三万斤外，并非法挪用民政事业粮三万斤，建设事业粮一万斤。县委员会新修大楼与县政府大楼相仿。县公安局亦自修建楼房一座，开支情况亦须检查。县委员会修建楼房时，因包工者无法购得洋灰，即欺骗上级以修水闸为名套购洋灰八千斤。
    五、由于县级各机关、各企业大兴土木，“动员”居民搬家者六、七十户。民房折价低廉，如县委员会修大楼时，“动员”了二十多户居民搬家，房子只折价约二、三十石米，但只拆砖一项的收入，即值六、七十石米。
    总之，我们彭泽县县级机关以县委员会为首的违法乱纪行为已达到不能容忍的程度，根本没有国家观念和人民观念，把国家一切财政制度都变成克扣虚报冒领的科目。为了自己贪图享受，不顾人民的死活。如县委员会修大楼“动员”居民搬家，并不是地基不足，而是因为民房在前面挡着大楼，不能全貌出现，显示排场。我所检举的这些情况，只是问题的一部分，希望彭泽县级领导机关深刻检查，公开检讨。并请江西省领导机关直接派人到彭泽县严格检查。  中央政法干部学校二班三组  王振华
    编者按：江西省彭泽县县级机关违法乱纪的现象是严重的。中共江西省省委和省人民政府应该深入检查处理。
