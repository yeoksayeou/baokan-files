[Our Newspaper] In the in-depth anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, state-owned enterprise departments are constantly exposing the rampant facts of the bourgeoisie's planned and organized theft of national economic intelligence. In order to seize huge profits, the bourgeoisie has tried every means to use despicable methods of "sending in" and "pulling over" agents to steal national economic intelligence in order to carry out large-scale speculative activities that endanger the national economy and the people's livelihood. Among the seven major embezzlers already arrested by the China Industrial Equipment Company, five were bourgeois agents sent in or traitors pulled over. This fact should attract the serious attention of state-owned enterprise departments in various regions.

Among the five bourgeois agents and traitors arrested by the China Industrial Equipment Company, for example, the criminal Xu Yutian applied for a job at the China Industrial Equipment Company (then located in Tianjin) in October 1950. Soon after he arrived at the company, he was pulled over by Wang Weimin, the manager of Tianjin Xin Tai Commercial Firm. The unscrupulous merchant Wang Weimin used a 5% commission as bait to ask Xu Yutian to provide information on price changes, company inventory figures, and samples and unit prices of imported goods. For example, when the unscrupulous merchant Wang Weimin was preparing to transport pigments to Shanghai for sale, Xu Yutian told him about the situation in the China Industrial Equipment Company's East China branch daily report that Shanghai had a lot of pigments and they were not easy to sell. Later, Xu also copied Shanghai's inventory reports and the prices of various goods for Wang Weimin, allowing this unscrupulous merchant to carry out speculative activities rampantly.

The unscrupulous merchant Deng Jihou, who partnered with Wang Weimin in business, introduced his younger brother Deng Xiwei to work at the China Industrial Equipment Company through Xu Yutian in order to collect more economic intelligence. After Deng Xiwei infiltrated the company, he spent all day inquiring about the company's internal situation. When the company held important meetings, he secretly roamed around the door and windows; usually, he would steal documents from other people's desks and openly demand to participate in various important meetings. Once, the company held an important business meeting, and he sneaked in without approval. In this way, important documents such as samples and price lists of goods from various countries, the national production and sales situation of caustic soda, and even the company's ordering plan for 1952 were stolen by Deng Xiwei.

Another example is the criminal Wu Shimin, who was originally the business director of the Shanghai private Yonghua Industrial Raw Materials Firm. In the past, he had consistently engaged in speculative business with Yu Shouci, the manager of this firm. In June 1951, he infiltrated the China Industrial Equipment Company, and in October, he took leave to return to Shanghai, telling the unscrupulous merchant Yu Shouci that there was a shortage of materials such as caustic soda at the time, and that the state-owned company's inventory was also low, and helped him to rush to purchase, causing fluctuations in the price of materials such as caustic soda at the time. Wu also signed a secret agreement with the unscrupulous merchant Yu Shouci to continue returning to the company to steal economic intelligence. In order to further expand the theft activities, Wu Shimin also introduced Yu Shouci's nephew Lin Hongyuan and Niu Jinzhang, an employee of Yonghua Industrial Raw Materials Firm, to work at the Guangzhou and Nanchang offices of the Central South branch of the China Industrial Equipment Company, respectively.

The arrested criminal Zhu Guangyao was originally the son of the manager of the Shanghai Hongyuan Chemical Raw Materials Firm. In June 1951, he infiltrated the China Industrial Equipment Company's Chemical Department's Chemical Section to manage the warehouse. He had successively informed his father of the situation of materials such as soda ash, borax, and Chilean nitrate.

Chen Zisheng, the confidential secretary of the China Industrial Equipment Company, was an insider pulled over by the Tianjin unscrupulous merchant Song Dehuan (Chen Zisheng's cousin-in-law, manager of Xinlong Dye Firm). In July 1951, Chen Zisheng learned from a report from East China that Shanghai was very short of cooked red dye, and the price was higher than in other regions, so he immediately wrote to Song Dehuan, asking him to transport cooked red dye to Shanghai for sale. In November, there was a shortage of black iron sheet on the market, and the price was high. At the same time, the company was about to adjust the price of washbasins, and Chen Zisheng immediately wrote to Song Dehuan asking him to do this business. Later, he promptly reported to Song Dehuan the situation that Qingdao was short of pig iron, the Northeast region adjusted the price of sack bags, and the Shanxi branch of the China Industrial Equipment Company had a lot of automobile parts in stock that could not be sold, and so on.

The bourgeoisie's despicable and shameless theft of national economic intelligence and speculative activities resulted in price fluctuations in industrial equipment last year, causing great losses to the country and the people. For example, after Deng Xiwei and Zhu Guangyao stole the national caustic soda production and sales situation in 1951 and the inventory situation of caustic soda and soda ash and provided it to capitalists, the capitalists rushed to purchase caustic soda and soda ash in large quantities, causing price fluctuations in caustic soda and soda ash in cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beijing. At that time, in Shanghai, in less than a month, the market price of caustic soda rose from 12 million yuan per ton to more than 15 million yuan, and the price of soda ash rose from more than 220,000 yuan per barrel to more than 400,000 yuan. Many soap factories and dyeing and weaving industries could not buy caustic soda and soda ash. In Tianjin, many citizens could not buy alkali for use. For example, after unscrupulous merchants such as Tianjin Xin Tai Commercial Firm learned from Chen Zisheng and others that the price of dyes in Shanghai was higher than in Tianjin, they rushed to buy large quantities of dyes in Tianjin and sold them in Shanghai, making a huge profit of more than 200,000 yuan for each small barrel. In other cases, such as tinplate and plain white iron, the bourgeoisie gained knowledge of the inventory situation of state-owned companies and the prices in various regions, and carried out illegal rushes to purchase, causing the price of tinplate to rise from more than 33 million yuan per ton to more than 66 million yuan, and the price of plain white iron to rise from more than 20 million yuan per ton to more than 48 million yuan. Similar situations have been constantly discovered in state-owned enterprise departments across the country. In order to protect the property of the state and defeat the bourgeoisie's rampant attack, state-owned enterprise departments in various regions should thoroughly eliminate all hidden economic counter-revolutionaries.

    中国工业器材公司在反贪污斗争中
    揭露盗窃经济情报的严重事实
    国营企业部门应当彻底清洗资产阶级坐探
    【本报讯】国营企业部门在深入开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，不断揭露出资产阶级有计划地有组织地盗窃国家经济情报的猖狂事实。资产阶级为了攫取暴利，千方百计地利用“派进来”和“拉过去”的卑鄙手段，盗窃国家经济情报，以进行大规模的危害国计民生的投机倒把勾当。中国工业器材公司在已经捕获的七名大贪污犯中，就有五个罪犯是资产阶级派进来的坐探或拉过去的奸细。这一事实，应当引起各地国营企业部门的严重注意。
    中国工业器材公司所捕获的五名资产阶级坐探和奸细中，例如徐犯雨田，一九五○年十月投考到中国工业器材公司（当时公司在天津）工作。他到公司不久，就被天津鑫泰商行经理王慰民给拉过去了。奸商王慰民以红利百分之五为钓饵，要徐雨田供给物价变动、公司库存数字和进口货品的样品、单价等情报。如当奸商王慰民准备运颜料到上海去卖时，徐犯雨田就把中国工业器材公司华东区公司日报表中有关上海颜料多、不好出售的情况告诉他。以后，徐犯又把上海库存报表和各种货物的牌价抄给王慰民，使这个奸商得以猖狂地进行投机活动。
    和王慰民合伙作生意的奸商邓季候，为了搜集更多的经济情报，通过徐犯雨田进一步把自己的弟弟邓锡伟介绍到中国工业器材公司工作。邓锡伟钻进公司以后，就成天打听公司内部情况。公司开重要会议时，他偷偷地在门口窗前溜来溜去；平时就到别人办公桌上偷翻文件，并公开提出要求参加各种重要会议。有一次公司召开重要业务会议，他没有经过批准就混进去了。就是这样，各国货物的样品、价目、全国烧碱的产销情况，甚至于一九五二年公司订货计划等重要文件，都被邓锡伟偷盗出去了。
    又如吴犯石民原来是上海私营永华工业原料行的业务主任，过去一贯和这个行的经理虞寿慈作投机生意。一九五一年六月，他钻进了中国工业器材公司，十月间请假回到上海，把当时烧碱等物资很缺乏，国营公司库存也不多的情况告诉奸商虞寿慈，并帮助他进行抢购，造成当时烧碱等物资价格的波动。吴犯并和奸商虞寿慈订了秘密协定，继续回到公司盗窃经济情报。为了进一步扩大盗窃活动，吴石民又把虞寿慈的外甥林洪远和永华工业原料行职员牛锦章二人分别介绍到中国工业器材公司中南区公司广州、南昌两个办事处工作。
    被捕获的朱犯广铫原来是上海洪源化工原料行经理的儿子。一九五一年六月打入中国工业器材公司化工处化工科管库工作。他曾先后把纯碱、硼砂、智利硝等物资的情况告诉他父亲。
    中国工业器材公司机要秘书陈子生，是被天津奸商宋德焕（陈子生的表妹夫，信隆染料行经理）拉过去的一个内奸。一九五一年七月，陈子生从华东来的报告中了解到上海市煮红很缺，价钱比其他地区都高的情况，就马上写信告诉宋德焕，要他运煮红到上海去卖。十一月；市面上黑铁皮很缺，价钱高，同时公司又要调整洗脸盆的价格，陈子生马上又写信要宋德焕做这种生意。以后，青岛市缺乏生铁，东北地区调整麻袋价格，中国工业器材公司山西分公司汽车零件库存很多而卖不出去等等情况，他都及时地报告给宋德焕。
    资产阶级卑鄙无耻地盗窃国家经济情报、进行投机活动的结果，造成去年工业器材价格的波动，给国家和人民造成很大的损失。如邓锡伟、朱广铫盗取一九五一年全国烧碱产销情况和烧碱、纯碱的库存情况供给资本家后，资本家就大肆抢购烧碱和纯碱，造成上海、天津、北京等城市烧碱和纯碱价格的波动。当时在上海，不到一个月的时间，烧碱由每吨市价一千二百万元涨到一千五百多万元，纯碱由每桶二十二万多元涨到四十多万元。很多制造肥皂的工厂、染织业都买不到烧碱和纯碱。在天津，很多市民也买不到碱用。又如天津鑫泰商行等奸商通过陈子生等知道上海染料比天津价高的情况后，就在天津抢购大批染料到上海去卖，每一小桶获得暴利二十多万元。其他如马口铁、平白铁，也因为资产阶级获得国营公司库存情况和各地价格的情况，进行非法的抢购，使马口铁由每吨三千三百多万涨到六千六百多万元，平白铁由每吨二千多万元涨到四千八百多万元。类似的情况已在全国各地国营企业部门不断被发现。为了保护国家的财产，击败资产阶级的猖狂进攻，各地国营企业部门应该彻底把暗藏的经济反革命分子全部清除干净。
