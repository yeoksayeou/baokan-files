The treacherous merchant Zhao Jinfeng, owner of Shanghai Xiehe New Hardware Store, and others, secretly harmed the People's Liberation Army during the Liberation of Zhoushan Campaign. Following mass accusations, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has arrested the criminal Zhao.

During the campaign by the Chinese People's Liberation Army to liberate the Zhoushan Islands in May 1950, the People's Liberation Army suffered unexpected losses due to the sabotage and treachery of some Shanghai merchants who were contracted to produce military supplies. One of these extremely wicked merchants—Zhao Jinfeng, the owner of Xiehe New Hardware Store—has been arrested by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government following accusations by the masses.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army's campaign to liberate the Zhoushan Islands destroyed the base used by the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs to blockade and bomb Shanghai and other parts of East China. The people, who had suffered from the American-Chiang blockade and bombing, wholeheartedly supported this campaign. However, treacherous merchants like Zhao Jinfeng engaged in sabotage activities, assisting the American and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gangs. Criminal Zhao, in collusion with Gu Benshan, owner of Xinhua Electric Factory, Ji Fudong of Senchang Hardware Store, and Gu Juqing, owner of Jinlong Brown Rope Factory, used "sugar-coated bullets" to attack procurement cadres of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, using inferior goods as superior goods to swindle large amounts of state assets, resulting in multiple serious and unexpected losses for the Liberation Army during the campaign. For example, a batch of anchor ropes (white coir ropes) they produced were white coir on the surface but rotten hemp inside, unable to withstand wind and waves. When the Liberation Army was ordered to pursue the remaining bandits in Zhoushan in May 1950, some ships were delayed in landing because their anchor ropes broke. In another incident, when a group of ships encountered a gale and all ships dropped their safety anchors, nine ships had their anchor ropes break, forcing them to rely on their engines to resist the gale. Two of these ships drifted far away and were rescued only after emergency measures. Additionally, 90 percent of a batch of machinery and hardware materials (produced by Xinhua Electric Factory) were substandard or unusable. For example, when some ships encountered enemy warships on one occasion and were in a critical situation, the machinery of two ships suddenly broke down, causing these two ships to suffer losses. This is the treasonous crime committed by treacherous merchants like Zhao Jinfeng.

Zhao Jinfeng made a fortune through his treasonous activities. His Xiehe New Hardware Store was established in November 1949 with a capital of ten million yuan, but in just the four to five months when the People's Liberation Army was preparing to liberate Zhoushan, it conducted nearly sixty billion yuan in transactions (the vast majority of which were with the Zhoushan Liberation forces). The amount of state assets he swindled is currently difficult to calculate; he has still not handed over two hundred million yuan that he embezzled from the procurement personnel. He kept three sets of books; the publicly declared accounts only recorded six billion yuan, indicating that the remaining fifty billion yuan or more were secret accounts, used to evade a large amount of national tax.

The treasonous activities of the treacherous merchant Zhao Jinfeng were planned and organized. From the first day he opened Xiehe New Hardware Store, he sent his concubine, Xu Xiaofeng, to reside permanently at the New Asia Hotel, where procurement personnel from various parties frequently stayed, to seduce the hotel's three tea servers and set up an intelligence network and traps to harm procurement personnel. In early 1950, Zhao learned that Sun Shude, a procurement officer from a certain army corps of the People's Liberation Army preparing to liberate Zhoushan, had arrived at the New Asia Hotel and needed to purchase large quantities of hardware, coir rope, and other military supplies. He immediately went to great lengths to win him over. He first took the loss on the first deal, worth only four million yuan. When the first deal was completed, he held a banquet to "send off" Sun Shude, but Sun refused. However, he did not lose heart. Soon after, he learned that Sun and Sun's father had come to Shanghai, and he used money and gifts to win over Sun's father. Later, when Sun's sister and brother came to Shanghai, Zhao Jinfeng entertained them warmly, "taking care" of them meticulously. Zhao Jinfeng's concubine, Xu Xiaofeng, also intensified her attack on Sun at the New Asia Hotel, completely dragging Sun Shude into a quagmire of depravity. From then on, all materials purchased by Sun passed through Zhao Jinfeng's hands. Criminal Zhao then used methods such as using inferior goods as superior goods to steal state assets and undermine the People's Liberation Army's combat missions.

After the anti-treacherous merchant struggle was launched in Shanghai, Zhao Jinfeng, despite mass accusations and inspection materials from relevant units, refused to confess and resisted investigation. The Shanghai Municipal People's Government has now arrested the criminal Zhao in accordance with the law. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海协和新五金号奸商赵金峰等
    在解放舟山战役中曾暗害人民解放军
    经群众检举上海市人民政府已把赵犯逮捕
    中国人民解放军在一九五零年五月解放舟山群岛的战役中，由于上海市一部分承制军需品的奸商在背后从事破坏和陷害，曾遭受到不少意外的损失。这些罪大恶极的奸商中的一个——协和新五金号老板赵金峰，经群众检举出来后，上海市人民政府已将其逮捕。
    中国人民解放军解放舟山群岛的战役摧毁了美、蒋匪帮封锁和轰炸上海和华东其他地方的基地。身受美蒋封锁、轰炸灾害的人民，无不全心全力地支援这一战役。但是奸商赵金峰等却从事破坏活动，帮助了美、蒋匪帮。赵犯串同了新华电器厂老板顾本善、森昌五金号吉福东、金龙棕绳厂老板顾聚庆等，用“糖衣炮弹”向人民解放军某部的采购干部进攻，用劣货充好货骗取大量国家资财，结果使解放军在战役中发生了多次严重的意外损失。例如他们承制的一批锚绳（白棕绳）表面上是白洋棕，里面却是烂麻皮，经不起风吹浪打。当一九五零年五月，解放军奉命追击舟山残匪时，有些船只便因锚绳折断而迟缓了登岸动作。还有一部分船只遇到狂风，各船齐下保险锚，结果有九只船的锚绳都断了，只好靠发动机抵御狂风，其中有两只船飘流很远，经过紧急抢救才脱了险。还有一批机器和五金材料（由新华电器厂承制的），百分之九十是次货和不能用的。例如有一部分船只某次遭遇敌舰，正在危急的时候，有两只船的机器突然发生故障，这两只船遭受了损失。这就是奸商赵金峰等所犯的叛国罪行。
    奸商赵金峰在其叛国活动中发了横财。他的协和新五金号是在一九四九年十一月以一千万元资金开设的，但仅仅在人民解放军准备解放舟山的四五个月中，就做了近六十亿元的交易（绝大部分是和解放舟山部队的交易）。他从中骗取的国家资财目前还难以统计，仅他所侵吞的采购员的公款就还有二亿元至今尚未缴出。他有三套账簿，公开的账面上只纪录了六亿元的数字，可见其余五十多亿元都是暗账，大量地逃漏了国税。
    奸商赵金峰的叛国活动是有计划有组织地进行的。他在开设协和新五金号的第一天起，就派遣他的小老婆徐小凤常住在经常有各方采购人员来往的新亚酒店，勾引了该店的三个茶房，安置好情报网和陷害采购人员的圈套。在一九五零年初，赵犯获知解放舟山的人民解放军某兵团的采购员孙树德来到新亚酒店，并要大批采购五金、棕绳等军需物资，立即千方百计地上前笼络。他先不惜蚀本地抢下第一笔仅值四百万元的生意。第一笔生意做成时，他摆筵席“欢送”孙树德，当时被孙拒绝了。但他一点不灰心。不久又打听到孙和孙的父亲来上海，他就用钱和礼物把孙的父亲拉了过去。以后孙的妹妹、哥哥到上海来，都由赵金峰殷勤款待，“照顾”得无微不至。赵金峰安置在新亚酒店的小老婆徐小凤也加紧向孙进攻，把孙树德完全拖下堕落的泥坑。从此，凡孙所采购的一切物资都经过赵金峰的手。赵犯便从中以劣货充好货等手段窃取国家资财，破坏人民解放军的作战任务。
    赵金峰在上海市展开反奸商斗争后，虽有群众的检举和有关部队的检查材料，仍拒绝坦白，抗拒查询，上海市人民政府现已依法将赵犯逮捕。  （新华社）
