The editorial department of Nanjing Xinhua Daily convened a forum with thirty-nine shop employees in Nanjing, including Xu Hao. From the speeches at the forum, it is clear that the class consciousness of shop employees in Nanjing has greatly improved during this movement. They are continuing to strengthen their unity and bravely launching a struggle against illegal capitalists.

At the meeting, shop employees exposed the crimes of illegal merchants in Nanjing, such as bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state property, as well as the shameless means used by these merchants to threaten, entice, deceive, and sow discord among shop employees during the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion campaign.

Ma Yongxuan, a shop employee at Xieji Electrical and Plumbing Store on Taiping Road, said: The capitalist of Xieji Electrical and Plumbing Store engaged in serious corner-cutting and theft of state property when contracting public electrical and plumbing projects in the past. During the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion campaign, instead of admitting his mistakes and confessing his crimes to the people, he used various despicable methods to threaten us, attempting to prevent us from exposing his illegal activities. The first trick the capitalist played on us was enticement. For example, recently a military institution wanted our store to do a batch of projects, and the capitalist said to us: "This time, the labor side will do the project; I won't do it." He also said: "If you expose me, it means we are not united internally." He used these words to blur our class consciousness. Of course, we ignored his tricks. Seeing that soft tactics didn't work, he threatened us. One day he said to us: "If you expose me without facts, you are 'saboteurs' and 'counter-revolutionaries.'" He even went to the home of shop employee Liu Qihua and intimidated his father, saying: "If Liu Qihua exposes me, I will not be polite to you. I will say you have guns in your house." In addition, he now constantly claims to be poor and has stopped paying our wages. Recently, because we frequently called the trade union, on January 20, he removed the phone in the store, attempting to prevent us from contacting the trade union.

Meng Xuejie, a worker at the Tianfa Bathhouse in Xiaguan, said: Since I returned from attending the shop employee representatives' meeting, the capitalist of Tianfa Bathhouse has been particularly polite to me. But when I conveyed the situation of the conference to all the shop employees, the boss was eavesdropping next door. After I reported, I asked everyone to express their opinions, but many people were apprehensive because the boss was next door. Obviously, the boss deliberately controlled and hindered our meeting in secret. Two days later, the capitalist released a rumor saying: "Since Meng Xuejie held a meeting, my store has been charged 30% more in taxes. This is terrible, the store is going to collapse." Another time, when we were in a meeting, the boss threatened everyone in the next room, saying: I will tell you all to get out!

Duan Guozhang, a shop employee at Yang Hanji Enamelware Store on Jiankang Road, said: After the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion campaign began, illegal capitalists used various despicable means to threaten and entice shop employees. For example, after shop employees exposed the illegal behavior of the capitalist of the Detei Clothing Store in Shuiximen, the capitalist worsened the shop employee's meals. Qinghua Zhai Hat Shop on Zhongshan South Road took the opposite approach. Before the anti-bribery campaign, they ate simple dishes in the store. After the campaign started, they ate four dishes, which was the capitalist trying to curry favor with the shop employees. The capitalist of Jinchang Hat Factory was afraid that shop employees would go out and expose him, so he tried to prevent shop employees from studying. One day, he even had his daughter play cards with a certain shop employee, which was eventually exposed by the shop employee. The capitalist in our store said to shop employee comrades: "I can't think of anything to confess. I hope you can provide materials to help me confess to the union." We knew this was an insincere attitude, so we ignored him.

Zhao Jinwen, a shop employee at Xinhua Bookstore on Zhonghua Road, said: The boss of Xinhua Bookstore evaded taxes of about 4 million yuan. When he heard that I was going to expose him, he first threatened me by saying he would "kill himself in front of me." I ignored him and still wanted to expose him, so he knelt in front of me and asked me to spare him. If I spared him, wouldn't I be letting down our working class?

The shop employees participating in the forum unanimously expressed their determination to fight to the end with illegal capitalists. If the merchants do not thoroughly confess, they will resolutely expose them.

Zhao Changyou, a worker at Shenfuxing Rice Mill on Zhongshan East Road, said: When the anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion campaign began, the capitalist of Shenfuxing Rice Mill colluded with individual backward workers to attack activists. After his trick failed, he joined with the bosses of several rice mills to hold meetings every day. After the meetings, he secretly withdrew capital. When we questioned him, he threatened us, saying: "I would rather go to jail, I won't open the store." He also said "I'm going to change professions." In reality, he was trying to evade the movement. But the worker brothers in our factory have confidence and will definitely fight his insincere style to the end.

Ye Zilong, a shop employee at Guomin Tea Shop on Suiyuan Road in Xiaguan, said: The business attitude of our tea shop owner is very dishonest, and his idea of exorbitant profits is very serious. He sells bad rough tea as good quality tea, selling 4,000 yuan per tael Longjing tea as 8,000 yuan tea to customers. It is also common to create fake accounts to evade taxes. He once created fake accounts and fake invoices for more than 700 jin of tea. During this campaign, he also threatened us and asked my father to take me home. Later, he said to me: "I will increase your salary, as long as you don't expose me, everything can be solved." I have seen through these conspiracies, and we will definitely fight him to the end and expose his true colors.

Li Yuanlin, a shop employee at a lumber and bamboo store, said: In our lumber and bamboo industry, the things that some store owners are now confessing are small, not big. Many bosses are still watching, wanting to see which way the wind blows and wanting to evade this movement. For example, the capitalists of Yongda Lumber Store on Hanzhong Road, etc., are afraid that people will drag out their tails. When they issued the year-end bonus, they gave each shop employee nine months' worth of bonuses, allowing them to return to their hometowns for the New Year and giving them a one-month vacation with salary. But after our trade union responded to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, we are actively collecting materials and are determined to expose the shameless crimes of the merchants. It is impossible for them to escape inspection in this movement.

Chen Jingren, a shop employee at Yao Yixing Lime Store, said: After shop employees exposed the tax evasion crimes of the boss of Yao Yixing Lime Store, he maliciously transported the goods from the store away. Our four shop employees resolutely fought him. We received many letters from worker comrades encouraging us, which gave us a hundredfold increase in courage. We vow to fight illegal merchants to the end.

Liu Xueyi, a shop employee at Feilong Department Store on Zhujiang Road, said: After workers at Qunyi Rice Mill exposed the boss's illegal behavior, the boss threatened them with dismissal. But after the workers' serious protest and struggle, the boss did not dare to dismiss them. It can be seen that as long as our workers are united, our strength is very great, and the boss will never dare to act recklessly.

Du Mingchu, a shop employee at Yaoshen Wool Company, said: The boss of Yaoshen Wool Company has consistently withdrawn capital and evaded taxes, often creating invoices and opening fake invoices. Since liberation, he has withdrawn a total of 3,000 pounds of wool. Recently, he withdrew 15 million yuan during the adjustment of capital. After this movement began, the boss pretended to want us to help him "confess." He wanted to extract information from us. We simply told him: "You know what's in your heart, you confess yours, we know what's in our hearts, we expose ours. You go to your union to confess, we go to our union to expose." In this way, we stood firm on the position of the working class, so he had no choice but to confess.

They talked at the forum that uniting and mobilizing employees is the key to doing a good job in the exposure movement. Chen Anyi, a shop employee at Guanglu Petroleum Store, talked about the necessity of uniting the accountant. He said: After the movement began, the boss of Guanglu Petroleum Store created fake accounts overnight. We knew that his behavior of creating fake accounts and evading taxes was harming the interests of the country and the people, so we wanted to expose him. But only the accountant knew the boss's accounts best. The accountant initially had a low level of awareness and was unwilling to expose him. Later, after our trade union group mobilized him several times, he finally exposed the boss's tax evasion and also exposed the boss's illegal behavior of mixing water into the oil. Therefore, I think that in this movement, winning over the accountant is a very important task, because the accountant is very clear about the boss's accounts. Accountants should also demonstrate the attitude of being masters of the country and actively expose the crimes of illegal merchants.

    南京新华日报召开店员工人座谈会
    揭发奸商行贿偷税等不法罪行
    店员工人表示：奸商不坦白，就坚决检举他！
    南京新华日报编辑部曾召集南京市许浩等三十九名店员工人举行座谈会。从座谈会的发言可以看出，南京市店员工人的阶级觉悟在这次运动中已大为提高，他们正继续加强团结，勇敢地对不法资本家展开斗争。
    会上，店员工人揭发了南京市不法商人行贿、偷税、盗窃国家财产等罪行，以及奸商们在反行贿、反偷税运动中对店员工人进行威胁、利诱、欺骗、离间等无耻手段。
    太平路协记水电行店员马永萱说：协记水电行资方在过去承包公家水电工程中，有严重的偷工减料和盗窃国家资财的行为。在反行贿、反偷税运动中，他不但不承认错误，向人民坦白认罪，反而用各种可耻的办法来威胁我们，妄图阻止我们对他不法行为的检举。资方对我们玩的第一个花样是利诱。如最近某军事机构有一批工程要我行去做，资方就对我们说：“这一次的工程，由你们劳方去做，我不做了。”又说：“你们要揭发我，这是我们内部闹不团结。”用这些话来模糊我们的阶级观念。对他这些鬼把戏，我们当然不理。他见软的不行，就威胁我们。一天他对我们说：“如果没有事实，你们要检举，就是‘破坏分子’，就是‘反革命’。”并跑到店员刘启华的家里，恫吓他父亲说：“如果刘启华检举了我，我就对你不客气，我说你家里有枪。”另外，他现在整天说穷，停发我们的工资。最近因为我们时常给工会打电话，一月二十日，他把店内的电话也撤了，妄图阻止我们同工会的联系。
    下关天发池浴堂工人孟学杰说：自从我参加店员工人代表会回去后，天发池浴堂资方就跟我特别客气。但当我向全体店员工人传达大会情况时，老板却在隔壁偷听。我报告后请大家发表意见，很多人就因为老板在隔壁而有顾虑。显然老板是有心在暗地里控制和阻挠我们开会。过了两天，资方放出一种空气说：“孟学杰开了一次会，我店就加了三成税款。不得了，店要垮了。”另一次，我们正在开会，老板就在隔壁房间里恐吓大家说：我要叫你们
    一个个给我滚蛋！
    建康路杨汉记搪磁店店员段国章说：反行贿、反偷税运动开始后，不法资方即用种种卑鄙手段来威胁利诱店员。如水西门德泰衣庄资方在店员把他的非法行为检举后，就把店员的饭食改坏。中山南路庆华斋帽店却采取了相反的办法。在反行贿运动以前，店中吃小菜，运动开始后吃四个菜，这是资方向店员工人讨好。金昌帽厂资方怕店员出去检举他，便设法阻止店员学习，有一天更叫女儿陪某店员打牌，后来终被店员揭穿。我们店内资方对店员同志说：“我想不起要坦白些什么，希望你们供给材料，好帮助我去公会坦白。”我们知道他这是一种不老实的态度，都没有理他。
    中华路新共和书局店员赵锦文说：新共和书局老板逃税约四百万元，听说我要揭发，他先用“撞死在你面前”来威胁我；我不理他，仍要检举，他便跪在我的面前，要我饶了他。如果我饶了他，我不就是对不起我们工人阶级了吗？
    参加座谈会的店员工人一致表示要和不法的资本家斗争到底；如果奸商不彻底坦白，就坚决地检举他们。
    中山东路申复兴米厂工人赵长友说：当反行贿、反偷漏税运动开始时，申复兴米厂资方就拉拢个别落后工人打击积极分子。他的诡计失败以后，就联合几家米厂的老板天天开会，开完会，就暗中抽资。我们质问他时，他威胁我们说：“我宁愿坐牢，店不开了。”又说“要转业了”。实际他是为了逃避运动。但我们厂里的工人兄弟有信心，一定和他这种不老实的作风斗争到底。
    下关绥远路国民茶庄店员叶梓龙说：我们茶庄的老板营业态度很不老实，暴利思想很严重。他把坏的毛茶当好货卖出，四千元一两的龙井他当八千元的货卖给顾客。造假账偷税也是常事。他一次假造七百多斤茶叶的假账、假发票。在这次运动中，他还威胁我们，叫我父亲带我回家去。以后又向我说：
    “给你增加薪金，只要你不检举我，什么问题都好办。”他这些阴谋毒计我已看透了，我们一定和他斗争到底，揭露他的原形。
    树木竹业店员李元麟说：我们树木竹业中，有些店家的老板，现在所坦白的事情都是小的，不是大的。很多老板都在观望，还想看风色，想逃避这个运动。如汉中路永大木行等资方，恐怕人家拖出他的尾巴，在发年终奖金时，发给每个店员九个月的红利，准他们还乡过年，给一个月假期，照发薪金。但我们工会在响应总工会号召后，正在多方搜集材料，决心要把奸商们的无耻罪行揭发干净。他们想在这次运动中逃过检查是不可能的。
    姚义兴石灰行店员陈静仁说：姚义兴石灰行老板在店员揭发了他的偷税罪行后，就恶毒地把店中货物运走。我们四个店员坚决跟他斗争。我们接到很多工人同志来信鼓励我们，使我们增加百倍勇气。我们誓与不法商人斗争到底。
    珠江路飞龙百货店店员刘学义说：群谊机米厂工人检举出老板的不法行为后，老板便用解雇威胁他们。但经过工人的严重抗议和斗争后，老板便不敢解雇了。可见我们工人只要团结一致，力量是很大的，老板决不敢胡作妄为。
    耀身绒线公司店员堵明初说：耀身绒线公司老板一贯抽资逃税，经常造发票、开伪发票。解放后抽资共达三千磅毛线之多。最近在调整资本中又抽掉资金一千五百万元。这次运动开始后，老板假意要我们帮助他“坦白”。他想套我们口里的材料。我们干脆告诉他：“你心里有数，你坦白你的，我们心里有数，我们检举我们的。你到你的公会去坦白，我们到我们的工会去检举。”就这样我们站稳了工人阶级立场，使他没有办法，只有坦白。
    他们在座谈会上谈到，团结和发动职员，是把检举运动搞好的关键。光陆石油行店员陈安逸谈了团结账房先生的必要。他说：运动开始后，光陆石油行老板连夜造假账。我们晓得他造假账、偷漏税的行为是危害国家和人民利益的，便想检举他。可是老板的账目只有账房先生最清楚。账房先生开始觉悟不高，不愿意检举。后来经过我们工会小组几次向他进行动员，他终于检举了老板的偷税行为，并检举了老板有一次在石油里掺水的不法行为。因此，我觉得在这一运动中，争取账房先生是个很重要的工作，因为账房先生对老板的账目十分清楚。账房先生们也应该表现出国家主人翁的态度，积极检举不法奸商的罪行。
