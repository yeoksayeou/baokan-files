    The Jiangxi Branch of the Central-South Nonferrous Metals Administration
    Should Inspect the Work of the Anhua Management Office
    Comrade Editor: Certain leading cadres of the Anhua Management Office of the Jiangxi Branch of the Central-South Nonferrous Metals Administration have a bureaucratic work style, causing great losses to state property. The leading cadres did not have a thorough plan beforehand, spending 170 to 180 million yuan to tear down and repair several old houses of the Management Office, and the houses are still not suitable for use. Five public security cadres of the Management Office rented a luxurious foreign-style house outside, spending 1,500 jin of rice on decorations alone; the public has to pay more than 9,000 jin of rice in rent every year, while some houses in the office are idle. Last year, when the Management Office purchased grain, it lost 300,000 jin of rice due to improper transportation and subsequent storage. There are still five or six thousand jin of vegetable oil purchased last September that cannot be sold. The leading cadres do not pay attention to these matters. They take a purely suppressive attitude towards all the staff of the office. They use expulsion to replace transformation and scolding to replace education. Some people can't bear it and quit. They restrict trade union activities. The Management Office has not held a single trade union group meeting in half a year. They arbitrarily dismissed worker Liao Bingchi. We suggest that the relevant leading departments send people to thoroughly investigate these problems.
                                                                                                Liao Shaorong

    中南有色金属管理局江西分局
    应检查安华管理处的工作
    编辑同志：中南有色金属管理局江西分局安华管理处某些领导干部有官僚主义作风，给国家财产造成很大损失。领导干部事先没有周密计划，把管理处的几间旧房子，拆拆修修，花了一亿七八千万元，房子依然不合用。管理处五个公安干部，在外面租了一幢华丽洋房，只一次装饰费就花了一千五百斤米；每年公家要付房租九千多斤米，而处里有些房子却闲着。去年管理处在采购粮食时，由于运输和以后保管不当，损失了三十万斤米。去年九月买进的菜油，到现在有五六千斤，销不出去。这些事情，领导干部都不过问。他们对全处工作人员一味采取压制态度。他们用开除来代替改造，用谩骂来代替教育。有些人忍不下去就不干了。他们限制工会活动，半年来，管理处没有开过一次工会小组会。他们随便开除工人廖炳池。我们建议有关领导部门派人来彻底检查这些问题。  廖绍荣
