    The Party's Good Son, the Cooperative's Good Cadre
    Li Ziyang Disregards His Own Home to Save the Cooperative's Property
    Li Ziyang, a salesman for the Pingfang Village Cooperative in Hulan County, Songjiang Province, comes from a farm laborer family. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1949. Under the Party's education and cultivation, he works very actively. While working at the Pingfang Village Cooperative last year, on the morning of May 3rd, a fire suddenly broke out at the Li family in the west of the village. The fire was fanned by the wind, and thick smoke obscured the sky. At that time, the director of the cooperative had gone to the city to purchase goods, and the laboratory technician took the opportunity to slip home to salvage his own belongings. Li Ziyang had no choice but to carry the cooperative's goods outside, one trip after another. At this time, the wind was blowing even harder, almost lifting the burning roof, and thousands of fireballs fell from the sky. In an instant, the whole village was on fire, and the flames engulfed Li Ziyang's house, which was less than thirty steps away from the cooperative. At this moment, the cooperative also caught fire, and Li Ziyang's wife shouted fiercely: "Fire! Save our things!" But Comrade Li Ziyang thought: I am a Communist Party member, a cadre of the cooperative, and I must not let the cooperative's property suffer any loss. He disregarded everything, braving the thick smoke and raging fire, and ran to the cooperative again and again to save the goods, until the roof collapsed. Except for some inexpensive chalk and furniture, everything else was saved.
    More than ninety households were burned in the village. Li Ziyang's wife only managed to salvage some rags from her own home, and more than two thousand catties of grain and other things were burned to ashes. Li Ziyang's wife complained to him: "Since joining the revolution, you've forgotten your family." But he patiently educated her, saying to her: "Even if the house is burned down, we still have more than four hectares of land, which is much better than before liberation!" Some cooperative members said to him: "Our cooperative has insurance with the People's Insurance Company, why didn't you go home to save your own things?" He replied: "The money of the People's Insurance Company is the money of our country, the money of the people. What does my own stuff count for!"
    On the third day after the cooperative's building was burned down, Li Ziyang, in order to meet the needs of the members, borrowed a member's place and started selling goods again. The cooperative members all reflected: "The cooperative is truly serving the members wholeheartedly!" They unanimously praised: "Old Li is truly a good son of the Party, a good cadre of the cooperative." Songjiang Province Cooperative Federation

    党的好儿子，合作社的好干部
    李子阳不顾自己的家  抢救了合作社的财产
    松江省呼兰县平坊村合作社营业员李子阳，家庭是个雇农，一九四九年加入中国共产党，在党的教育培养下，他工作很积极。去年他在平坊村合作社工作时，五月三日那天早上，忽然村西头李家失火。火乘风势，浓烟遮天。当时合作社主任已到城里去办货，化验员又乘机溜回家去抢救自己的东西，李子阳只好自己一趟又一趟地把合作社的货物往外搬。这时风刮得更大了，几乎要抬起炽燃的房盖，千万朵火团从空中落下，霎时全村都着了火，火舌卷入了离合作社不到三十步的李子阳家；这时合作社也起火了，李子阳的老婆猛烈地喊：“救火啦！抢东西啦！”而李子阳同志却想着：自己是共产党员，是合作社的干部，绝不能让合作社的财产受损失。他不顾一切地冒着浓烟烈火，一次又一次地跑到合作社去抢救货物，直到房顶塌下来时，除了些不很值钱的粉笔家具外，其余的都抢救出来了。
    全村烧了九十多户。李子阳的老婆只从自己的家里抢出一些破衣服，家中两千多斤的粮食和其他东西，都烧成灰烬了。李子阳的老婆埋怨他：“参加了革命，忘掉了家。”而他却耐心教育她，对她说：“烧光了家咱们还有四垧多地，也比解放前光景强得多呀！”有些社员们向他说：“咱们合作社已在人民保险公司保了险，你为啥不回家抢自己的东西呢？”他却回答：“人民保险公司的钱就是咱国家的钱，就是人民的钱，自己的东西算啥！”
    合作社房子烧了的第三天，李子阳为了满足社员的需要，借了一个社员的地方，又卖起货来。社员群众都反映：“合作社真是全心全意地为社员服务！”一致称赞：“老李真是党的好儿子，合作社的好干部。”  松江省合作总联社
