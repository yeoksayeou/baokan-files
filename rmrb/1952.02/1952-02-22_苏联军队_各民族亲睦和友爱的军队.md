    The Soviet Army—An Army of Friendship and Fraternity Among Nationalities
    Soviet Army Major General Moskovsky

    The Soviet people, amidst the remarkable achievements on the road to communism, are welcoming the thirty-fourth anniversary of their dear sons and daughters—the army of the socialist state.

    The Army, Air Force, and Navy of the Soviet Union, steadfastly and unyieldingly defending the national interests of the Soviet Union, vigilantly protecting the peaceful and creative labor of the Soviet people—the creators and victors—have been doing so for more than thirty years.

    The Soviet Army was born in the flames of the Great October Socialist Revolution. It has grown and been consolidated in the struggle against the numerous enemies of the Soviet Motherland.

    The establishment of a new type of army, an army that liberated workers and peasants and was inseparably integrated with the people, is the greatest achievement of the Bolshevik Party and its leaders—Lenin and Stalin. Lenin and Stalin, with their genius, foresaw that the Soviet state would inevitably undergo severe military tests and therefore created a reliable defender of the socialist state.

    The working people of the Soviet Union, like all progressive humanity, call the Soviet Army an army of peace. This title has profound foundations. From the first day of its establishment, the Soviet socialist state declared the policy of peace and cooperation among nations as the principle of its foreign policy.

    This army, born of the October Revolution, has been dedicated to peace and the defense of security among nations since its inception. The entire history of the Soviet Army is a history of selfless and ardent service to the cause of peace and security of the socialist state, and of heroic struggle against all kinds of aggressors. Such an army is unprecedented in human history.

    Lenin said in his speech on "Red Officer Day" in 1918: "... I remember something I encountered not long ago in a Finnish railway carriage.

    I saw a group of people smiling when they heard an old woman speaking, so I asked someone to translate her words for me. This Finnish old woman compared the soldiers of the old army with the revolutionary soldiers, saying that the soldiers of the old army protected landlords and capitalists, while the revolutionary soldiers protected the poor. ...She said: 'Now there is no need to be afraid of people carrying guns.'" Lenin concluded: "I think that it is hard to imagine a more noble award for the Red Army than this."

    More than thirty years have passed since then, and during the years of struggle against the Hitlerite bandits, Soviet soldiers appeared in the rural areas and cities of Eastern Europe. They drove the fascist beasts from there. Those originally sad faces reappeared with radiance and unanimously shouted a word that could be understood in all the languages of the world—Stalin!

    Stalin instructed: Our army "is an army that consolidates the fraternal friendship among the various nationalities of our country, an army that liberates the previously oppressed nationalities of our country, an army that defends the freedom and independence of our nationalities. ...The source of the Red Army's strength lies in the fact that from the day of its birth, it has been educated with internationalism as its main purpose, with respect for other nations as its main purpose, with love and respect for the workers of all countries as its main purpose, and with the maintenance and foundation of international peace as its main purpose."

    Every time the Soviet Army took up arms, it was because enemies who violated the honor, freedom, and independence of the Soviet people forced them to do so.

    This was the case from 1918 to 1920. At that time, the armies of the British, American, and French interventionists attempted to destroy the young Soviet state by force. The Soviet Army finally crushed the superiority of the interventionists and drove them out of the country. During the Second World War, fascist Germany treacherously attacked the Soviet Union. The "heroes of Munich" hoped that the Soviet state would not be able to withstand the attacks of the fascist armored forces. Foolish politicians did not realize that the outcome of the war was not determined by temporarily effective factors, but by constantly effective factors—the consolidation of the rear, the morale of the army, the quantity and quality of divisions, the equipment of the army, and the organizational ability of the army's command. They did not realize that a people fighting for a just cause is invincible, and that a country that has established the most advanced social and state system and has the most advanced socialist economy is invincible.

    As a result of four years of war, the Soviet people and the army led by Stalin, the leader and brilliant strategist of all working people, completely defeated the Hitlerite army. During the war, the American and British imperialists secretly and openly delayed fulfilling their obligation to open a second front, consistently implementing their secret conspiracy—to weaken the Soviet Union by concentrating Hitler's army against it. When it became clear that the Soviet Union could defeat Nazi Germany and its accomplice states alone, the United States and Britain had to open a second front after a two-year delay. No historical falsifier can hide this shameful fact from world opinion!

    In the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Army appeared before the whole world as a first-rate army with high moral and fighting qualities.

    The soldiers of the Soviet state have never invaded other countries. In the territory of any country, they are always the liberators of the people, the fighters for peace and democracy. On the huge green hills of Treptower Park in Berlin, there stands a bronze statue of a Soviet soldier, thirteen meters high, which is a symbol of the shining face of the Soviet state's soldiers: his right hand holds a bronze sword that has crushed the fascist swastika, and his left hand holds a child who has been saved, symbolizing the future of human happiness.

    In capitalist countries, imperialists incite the most despicable desires of their soldiers. The reactionary American journalist Wallace described the thinking of American soldiers this way: "Although other nations have their own systems, our system is killing. This is the American system, and therefore the best system." This is the beastly face of American imperialism.

    In the post-war period, the Soviet government insisted on pursuing a policy of peace and greatly reduced the size of the Soviet army. At the same time, the reactionary governments of capitalist countries continued to build new divisions, expand their armaments, and increase their military budgets. The United States is also establishing a network of military bases around the Soviet Union.

    The American and British imperialists' aggressive war in Korea has been going on for the second year. They are barbarically destroying and devastating the cities and villages of this peace-loving country, inflicting horrific suffering on its peaceful residents. Recently, they have intensified their aggressive steps in many other countries in the East and West, attempting to provoke a new world war and conspiring to maintain and consolidate their rule by plundering and enslaving the people.

    The policy of peace and friendship among nations successfully implemented by the democratic and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is completely contrary to the policy of war and aggression pursued by the reactionary ruling groups of capitalist countries. The strength of this camp, which defends the freedom and independence of all peoples, is growing day by day. The greatest movement of modern times—the movement to fight for peace and against war-mongers—has swept across all countries and strata of residents on the earth, regardless of their political, religious, or other beliefs. The words of the great standard-bearer of peace, Stalin, inspire the fighters for peace: "Peace can be maintained and consolidated if the people of all countries take up the cause of safeguarding peace and defend this cause to the end." The working people of all countries are full of determination to resist the war-mongers.

    The Soviet people and their armed forces will never forget the conspiracies of the American and British imperialists. The Soviet people, engaged in peaceful and creative labor, resolutely defend the cause of peace. However, anyone who thinks that the Soviet state's love of peace is a sign of weakness is greatly mistaken.

    The Soviet Army vigilantly guards the frontiers of the socialist state, protecting the peaceful labor of the Soviet people. The Soviet Army faithfully abides by the instructions of Stalin, the great standard-bearer of peace and friendship among nations, and steadfastly defends world peace. Its glory lies in this, and its strength lies here. (Translated by Jun Qiang)

    苏联军队——各民族亲睦和友爱的军队
    苏军少将  莫斯科夫斯基
    苏联人民在走向共产主义的卓越成就的情形下，来迎接自己亲爱的子弟——社会主义国家军队的三十四周年。
    苏联的陆军、空军和海军，坚强地和不屈不挠地保卫着苏联的国家利益，警觉地保护着苏联人民——创造者和胜利者——的和平的创造性劳动，已经三十多年了。
    苏联军队在伟大的十月社会主义革命的火焰里诞生。它是在与苏维埃祖国的许多敌人的斗争中生长和巩固起来的。
    新型的军队、解放工农并与人民不可分割地融合在一起的军队的建立，是布尔什维克党及其领袖——列宁和斯大林的最伟大的功绩。列宁和斯大林天才地预见到苏维埃国家不可避免的要经过严重的军事考验，因而创立了社会主义国家的可靠的捍卫者。
    苏联劳动人民，和全体进步人类一样地把苏联军队称做和平的军队。这个称号是有着深远的根据的。苏维埃社会主义国家从成立的第一天起，就宣布以和平与各民族合作的政策为自己的外交政策原则。
    十月革命所诞生的这一支军队，从她开始活动的时候起，就是为了和平与保卫各民族间的安全。苏联军队的全部历史，是忘我地和热忱地服务于社会主义国家的和平和安全事业的、和各种各色的侵略者进行英勇斗争的历史。这种军队，是人类历史上所从未有过的。
    列宁在一九一八年在“红色军官日”的演说中说道：“……我记起了不久前我在芬兰铁路火车厢里遇见的一件事情。
    我看见有群人听到一个老太婆说话时都在微笑什么，就请人把她的话译给我听。这个芬兰老太婆把旧军队兵士与革命兵士加以比较，说旧军队的兵士是保护地主资本家的，革命兵士却保护穷人。……她说：‘现在用不着害怕带枪的人了’。”列宁在结语时说：“我认为，对于红军说来，再也难想出比这更高贵的奖誉了”。
    从那时起已过去三十多年了，当反对希特勒匪帮进攻的斗争年代里，在东欧的农村和城市中出现了苏联军人。他们从那里赶走了法西斯野兽。那些原来悲哀的面孔又现出了光彩，并且同声喊出了世界各种语言都能了解的一个字——斯大林！
    斯大林曾指示说：我们的军队“是巩固我国各民族彼此间兄弟友爱关系的军队，是解放我国先前各被压迫民族的军队，是保卫我国各民族自由独立的军队。……我们红军力量雄厚的根源，就在于它从诞生的那天起就是受着以国际主义为主旨的教育，受着以尊重其他民族为主旨的教育，受着以爱重和尊敬世界各国工人为主旨的教育，受着以保持并奠定国际和平为主旨的教育。”
    每一次苏联军队拿起武器的时候，都是因为侵犯了苏联人民的光荣、自由和独立的敌人迫使他们这样做的。
    一九一八年至一九二○年的事实就是这样。当时英、美、法干涉者的军队企图以武力来毁灭年青的苏维埃国家。苏联军队终于粉碎了干涉者的优势，并把它们赶出了国土。在第二次世界大战时期，法西斯德国背信弃义地进攻苏联。“慕尼黑的好汉们”希望苏维埃国家抵挡不住法西斯装甲部队的袭击。愚蠢的政客们没有认识到战争的结果不是决定于暂时起作用的因素，而是决定于经常起作用的因素——后方的巩固、军队的士气、师团的量和质、军队的装备和军队指挥部的组织能力。他们没有认识到，为正义的事业而斗争的人民是不可战胜的，一个建立了最先进的社会和国家制度、具有最先进的社会主义经济的国家，是不可战胜的。
    四年战争的结果，苏联人民及全体劳动人民的领袖和天才的战略家斯大林所领导的军队，彻底击溃了希特勒军队。美英帝国主义者，在战争期间偷偷摸摸地同时又明显地拖延执行开辟第二战场的义务，一贯地实行其秘密阴谋——使希特勒军队集中全力对付苏联，从而削弱苏联。当苏联能够单独打败纳粹德国及其帮凶国家的事实已经十分明显的时候，美英才不得不在拖延二年以后开辟了第二战场。任何一个历史伪造家，都不能向世界舆论掩盖这件可耻的事实！
    在伟大的卫国战争中，苏联军队以具有高度道德和战斗品质的第一流军队的姿态，出现在全世界的面前。
    苏维埃国家的战士，从来没有侵略过其他国家。在任何国家的领土上，他们永远是人民的解放者，是争取和平与民主的战士。在柏林特列普特公园的巨大的绿色山岗上，耸立着一座高达十三公尺的苏军战士的青铜雕像，这就是苏维埃国家士兵光辉的面貌的标志：他右手握着一柄击溃了法西斯卐字的铜剑，左手抱着一个被拯救出来的象征人类幸福前途的孩子。
    在资本主义国家中，帝国主义者煽动他们兵士的最卑鄙的欲望。美国反动的记者华利士这样描述美国军人的思想：“虽然其他各民族各有各的制度，而我们的制度就是杀人。这是美国的制度，因而也是最好的制度”。美帝国主义的野兽面目就是这样。
    在战后时期，苏联政府坚持奉行和平政策，大量裁减了苏联军队的数目。同时资本主义国家的反动政府，却继续建立新的师团，扩张军备，增加军事预算。美国还在苏联周围建立着军事基地网。
    美英帝国主义者在朝鲜进行的侵略战争，已经是第二年了。它们野蛮地摧毁和破坏这个爱好和平的国家的城市和村庄，使它的和平居民遭受着骇人听闻的痛苦。近来，他们又在东西方许多其他国家加紧侵略步骤，企图挑起新的世界战争，阴谋以掠夺和奴役人民的方法来维持和巩固自己的统治权。
    以苏联为首的民主和社会主义阵营所成功地实行着的和平与各民族友好的政策，是与资本主义国家反动的统治集团所奉行的战争和侵略政策完全相反的。保卫各族人民的自由和独立的这个阵营的力量，正在一天天地增长着。现代最伟大的运动——争取和平反对战争贩子的运动，已经席卷了地球上各国和各阶层的居民，不论他们的政治、宗教和其他信仰如何。伟大的和平旗手斯大林的话，鼓舞着争取和平的战士：“如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。”各国劳动人民充满了反抗战争贩子的决心。
    苏联人民及其武装力量，永不会忘掉美英帝国主义者的阴谋。从事和平的创造性劳动的苏联人民，坚决地保卫和平事业。但是，谁如果认为苏维埃国家的爱好和平是软弱的表示，那么他就是大大地打算错了。
    苏联军队警惕地守卫着社会主义国家的边疆，保护着苏联人民的和平劳动。苏联军队忠诚地遵守着和平与各民族友好的伟大旗手——斯大林的指示，坚定不移地捍卫着世界和平。它的光荣就在于此，它的力量就在这里。（君强译）
