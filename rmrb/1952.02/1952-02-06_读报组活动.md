    Beijing Fourth District Trade Union Mobilizes Workers Through Reading Groups to Expose Corrupt and Bribery Criminals

    Editor Comrade: The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the grassroots organizations under the Beijing Fourth District Trade Union began at the start of this year. When we were arranging the publicity work for this movement, we particularly emphasized strengthening the leadership of the reading groups, and demanded that reading groups be developed and consolidated during the movement. The workers understood the policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government from reading and studying newspapers, and are determined and courageous in this struggle. The knitting industry is a relatively scattered industry. There are 270 knitting workers in the Fourth District, distributed in more than 60 small workshops, and it was difficult to educate them in the past. In this movement, they organized 18 reading groups according to region, and understood the significance of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement from reading newspapers, and actively participated in this movement. In the first three days of the movement alone, they reported more than 70 cases of tax evasion and theft of state property to the government. The capitalist of the private Shunli Iron Factory had engaged in bribery in the past. Just as the workers were preparing to report this, the capitalist of Shunli Iron Factory and the bribe-takers attempted to buy off the workers by distributing bribes, but the workers sternly refused. The bribe-takers even said that anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy were matters for cadres and capitalists, and had nothing to do with workers. He wanted to use these words to deceive everyone. However, the workers had already seen many facts and articles in the newspapers about workers reporting corruption and bribery, exposed his conspiracy, and finally reported the matter. The workers of Shangyi Distillery initially did not dare to report the corrupt elements in the Public Security Bureau. After reading the news of "Public Security Ministry corrupt element Song Degui arrested" on January 17, they increased their courage in the struggle and reported some local Public Security personnel with problems. Young worker Zhang Shihua said: "Reading the exposure in the newspaper of the criminal facts of the big corrupt officials Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, made me feel the greatness of the Communist Party from the bottom of my heart. In the past, I thought that the Party would always protect its members, but now I realize how open and aboveboard the Communist Party is."

    Many members of the reading groups can promote what they have learned from the newspapers to others anytime and anywhere; some factories and stores also write drafts for blackboards, arrange window displays or enlarge cartoons to post based on the content of the newspapers. This shows that the reading group has played a huge role in publicity work.

    The reading groups of the workers and masses in the Fourth District gradually developed during the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Over the past year, except for scattered industries such as construction and rickshaws, most factories and stores have ensured that every household has a newspaper to read; and more than 200 reading groups have been established, with approximately more than 2,000 workers and shop assistants participating in organized reading and learning.

    We include the work of leading reading groups in the district's publicity work plan, and clearly stipulate that organizing reading is one of the main tasks of the cultural and educational committee members and trade union propaganda team members of each grassroots trade union organization; in every central task or movement, we specifically guide reading group activities. In order to exchange experiences in reading work, we have organized four district-wide experience exchange conferences in the past year. However, we also have some shortcomings in our work. We have not done enough in inspecting and specifically assisting the reading groups, and some reading groups have become mere formalities.

    Experience of Developing Reading Group Work in Southern Jiangsu

    Since the National News Work Conference in April of the year before last, various places in Southern Jiangsu have started to establish reading groups. With the three major movements of Resisting America, Aiding Korea, Land Reform, and Suppressing Counterrevolutionaries, and the establishment of the propaganda network, reading groups in Southern Jiangsu have greatly developed. It has become a huge mass publicity force. According to statistics in October last year, there were 11,207 reading groups in Southern Jiangsu, with more than 203,700 members. The members include workers, peasants, revolutionary soldiers, cadres, citizens, students, and even monks and nuns. Among them, workers and peasants are the most numerous, accounting for about 65 percent. Among these more than 10,000 reading groups, about two-thirds can read newspapers regularly. The Lixin Yarn Factory reading group in Wuxi City and the Benniu Town reading group in Wujin County have absorbed more than 80 percent of the people in the entire factory and town to participate in reading, and can conduct publicity to the surrounding masses and their families. The Jiading County Committee of the Communist Party of China fully utilized the reading groups to mobilize workers and peasants to communicate with each other, help complete the task of selling and storing cotton, and at the same time carried out education on the worker-peasant alliance. The establishment of reading groups has expanded the activity base for propagandists. The connection between newspapers and the people has been strengthened, and the Southern Jiangsu Daily receives an average of more than 1,000 letters from reading groups every month.

    Over the past year and a half, we have gained the following experiences in developing reading group work:

    1. The Issue of Leadership of Reading Groups

    Reading groups are one of the effective tools for the Party to educate and connect with the masses, and are also the basic organizational form of the mass propaganda force. Therefore, reading group work should be jointly led by the local Party propaganda departments, government cultural and educational departments, and mass organizations; the newspaper should be responsible for political and ideological leadership. Initially, the purpose of various places in Southern Jiangsu to carry out reading group work was only to develop newspaper distribution and communication work; the publicity and education departments did not recognize that reading groups were an important propaganda and education tool, so reading work was difficult to carry out; even if it was established, it was difficult to consolidate. In order to change this situation, we have determined the following leadership relationships: Factory reading groups are the responsibility of the trade union's cultural and educational department; in rural areas, the township cultural and educational committee is responsible; in schools, the student union is responsible; in the city, the district cultural and educational committee is responsible. In areas with more reading groups, a reading committee organization can be set up under the above leadership system as the grassroots leadership organization for reading groups. The reading committee is generally composed of propaganda and education staff from Party organizations, governments, and people's organizations, and actively performing reading group leaders. Southern Jiangsu Daily, Worker Life Daily, and New Suzhou Daily all have publications specifically guiding reading group work, and have opened special columns on the newspaper to provide timely political and ideological leadership to reading groups. Wuxi, Suzhou, Yixing and other places have held reading group representative meetings to summarize work and exchange experiences; various places have held 28 training courses focusing on political education combined with reading group business, with approximately 3,000 trainees.

    2. Reading Group Work Must Be Closely Integrated with Central Work

    When various places in Southern Jiangsu began to establish reading work, they only proposed the abstract methods of "reading newspapers to learn to read," "reading and writing at the same time," and later proposed "reading, questioning, and discussing." It was not until after the Resist America, Aid Korea movement was launched that the leadership in various places clearly put forward the slogan of "what to do, what to read" and "what to read, what to do," emphasizing that reading must be combined with the central work. Facts have proved that as a result of doing so, reading groups not only promoted various tasks, but also developed and consolidated themselves. Among the six reading groups in Xushu Township, Baizhang District, Wujin County, only one reading group persisted because it was combined with the current land reform work; the third village reading group in Dapu Township, Yixing County, combined with the central work from the beginning, so the village's work was done very well, and the reading group also increased from one to six, with almost everyone in the village participating in reading and learning. When Chairman Mao put forward the call to "increase production, practice economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers," the employee reading group of Nanhui Minfeng Paper Mill began to check the waste phenomenon in their factory. For example, waste paper was not used in the past, but now more than 1,000 kilograms can be collected every ten days for recycling; the improvement of technical operations has also increased paper production by 7 percent. After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was launched, reading groups in various places were able to cooperate with this movement to conduct planned learning, and some groups actively promoted what they had learned from newspapers to the masses. For example, the residents' reading group in Xichun Street, Wuxi City, mobilized many people to listen to the newspaper when reading the newspaper; the blackboard newspaper was changed from irregular publication to daily publication; the readers went deep into the residents' groups to collect the masses' reflections on this movement and report and confess relevant corruption and tax evasion materials. The Caojia Village reading group in Xiaohe Township, Jiangyin reported a case of public grain fraud in the local area. The "Qunlian" reading group of the Southern Jiangsu Transportation Department reported that the second work group of the engineering department of the department wasted more than 100 million yuan due to bureaucracy. Jiang Yunong, the leader of the Beitang Street reading group in Wuxi City, reported the illegal behavior of some capitalists in the mineral oil industry evading taxes of 270 million yuan.

    3. The Organizational Form of Reading Groups Should Be Determined According to the Willingness of the Masses and the Convenience of Production

    Currently, reading groups are organized in factories by production teams; in rural areas by mutual aid teams or people's schools; in schools by classes or study groups; in cities, it is appropriate to establish reading groups jointly by several residents' groups. The reading method should be based on "reading, questioning, and discussing" according to the specific circumstances of the masses, and appropriately interspersed with question-and-answer sessions, singing, and quick talks. Reading groups with higher cultural levels can use the method of "reading separately and discussing collectively." At the same time, it is necessary to change the organizational form and reading method of the reading group in a timely manner following the new situation and changes in the production season. For example, in rural areas, the reading groups originally organized by village can be combined with winter school after the winter school starts; reading organizations can be centralized during slack farming seasons, while reading should be done during field rest during busy farming seasons.

    It is also necessary to gradually establish a reading system in reading groups. At present, most reading groups in Southern Jiangsu have formulated reading covenants in a democratic discussion manner, and these covenants have further consolidated the enthusiasm for reading. The content of the covenant includes "abiding by reading time," "not being absent without reason," "reporting the situation to the leading organs and newspapers in a timely manner," and "publicizing to the masses after reading," and so on.

    读报组活动
    北京四区工会通过读报组发动工人检举贪污行贿罪犯
    编辑同志：北京市第四区工会所属各基层组织的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动是在今年年初开始的。我们在布置对这一运动的宣传工作时，特别强调了加强读报组的领导，并要求在运动中发展和巩固读报组。工人们从读报学习中领会了共产党和人民政府的政策，对这一斗争是坚决而勇敢的。针织业是一个比较零散的行业。第四区全区针织工人有二百七十人，分布在六十多家小作坊里，过去很难受到教育。在这个运动中他们按地区组织起十八个读报组，从读报中懂得了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的意义，积极地参加了这个运动。只在运动开始的头三天，他们就向政府检举了七十多件偷税、盗窃国家财富的事件。私营舜力铁工厂资方过去曾有行贿行为，工人们正准备检举这件事时，舜力铁工厂资方和受贿者企图以分贿赂款的办法来收买工人，工人们严词拒绝了。受贿分子还说，反贪污浪费、反官僚主义是干部和资本家的事，与工人无关。他想用这一些话来欺骗大家。但工人早在报纸上看到许多工人检举贪污、行贿的事实和文章，揭穿了他的阴谋，并且终于检举了这件事。尚义酒厂的工人们，起初不敢检举公安局的贪污分子，一月十七日读了“公安部贪污分子宋德贵被逮捕”的消息后，他们增加了斗争的勇气，检举了当地一些有问题的公安人员。青年工人张世华说：“看了报纸上揭发刘青山、张子善大贪污犯的犯罪事实，使我从心眼里感到共产党的伟大。过去我认为党总是要包庇党员的，现在才体会到共产党是多么光明磊落。”
    很多读报组的组员都能把从报纸上学习到的东西随时随地向别人进行口头宣传；某些工厂、商店也都根据报纸的内容编写黑板报的稿子、布置窗橱或放大漫画张贴出去。这都说明了读报组在宣传工作中起了巨大的作用。
    第四区职工群众的读报组是在抗美援朝运动中逐渐发展起来的。一年多来，除建筑业、三轮车等零散行业外，在一般的工厂、商店中都做到了家家有报看；并建立了二百多个读报小组，约二千多工人、店员参加了有领导、有组织、有制度的读报学习。
    我们把领导读报组工作列入全区的宣传工作计划，并明确规定了组织读报是各工会基层组织文教委员和工会宣传队员的主要任务之一；在每一个中心工作或运动中，我们都具体地指导读报组活动。为了交流读报工作的经验，一年多来我们共组织过四次全区性的交流经验大会。但我们工作中也有一些缺点，我们对读报组的检查工作和具体帮助做得很不够，有些读报组流于形式主义。

    苏南开展读报组工作的经验
    前年四月全国新闻工作会议以后，苏南各地就着手进行建立读报组的工作。随着抗美援朝、土地改革、镇压反革命三大运动和宣传网的建立，苏南读报组有了很大的发展。它已成为一支庞大的群众性的宣传队伍。据去年十月份统计，苏南共有读报组一万一千二百零七个，组员二十万三千七百多人。成员包括工人、农民、革命军人、干部、市民、学生乃至和尚、尼姑等。其中以工人、农民最多，约占百分之六十五。这一万多个读报组中，约有三分之二能够经常读报。无锡市的丽新纱厂读报组，武进县的奔牛镇读报组，吸收了全厂和全镇百分之八十以上的人参加读报，并且能向周围群众和他们的家属进行宣传。中共嘉定县委曾充分运用了读报组，发动工人和农民互相通讯，帮助完成了售棉储棉的任务，同时进行了工农联盟的教育。读报组的建立，扩大了宣传员的活动阵地。报纸和人民群众的联系加强了，苏南日报平均每月收到各地读报组的来信一千多封。
    一年半来，在开展读报组工作上，我们取得了这几点经验：
    一、读报组的领导问题
    读报组是党教育群众和联系群众的有效工具之一，也是群众性宣传队伍的基本组织形式之一。因此读报组工作，应由当地党的宣传部门、政府的文教部门和群众团体共同领导；报社应该负责政治的和思想的领导。最初，苏南各地开展读报组工作，目的只是为了开展报纸的发行工作和通讯工作；宣教部门也没有认识到读报组是一种重要的宣传教育工具，所以读报工作很难开展；即使建立起来，也难于巩固。为改变这种情况，我们确定了如下的领导关系：工厂读报组由工会文教部负责；农村中由乡文教委员会负责；学校中由学生会负责；市民中由区的文教委员会负责。读报组比较多的地区，可在上述领导系统下专门设立读报委员会的组织，作为读报组的基层领导机构。读报委员会一般由党组织、政府、人民团体的宣教工作人员和表现积极的读报组长参加。苏南日报、工人生活报、新苏州报都办有专门指导读报工作的刊物，在报面上辟有专栏对读报组进行及时的政治领导和思想领导。无锡、苏州、宜兴等地曾召开读报组代表会议，总结工作，交流经验；各地举办过以政治教育为主结合读报组业务的训练班二十八期，受训人员约三千人。
    二、读报组工作必须密切和中心工作结合
    苏南各地开始建立读报工作时，只向读报组提出“读报识字”、“边读边写”，以后又提出“一读、二问、三讨论”的抽象办法。直到抗美援朝运动开展以后，各地领导方面才明确提出“做什么、读什么”、“读什么、做什么”的口号，强调读报必须和中心工作结合。事实证明，这样做的结果，读报组不但推动了各种工作，它的本身也发展和巩固了。武进县百丈区徐墅乡六个读报组，只有一个读报组因为结合了当前的土地改革工作，才坚持下来；宜兴大浦乡第三村读报组，一开始就结合中心工作，因而村里的工作搞得很好，读报组也从一个增加到六个，几乎全村的人都参加了读报学习。当毛主席提出“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的号召后，南汇民丰造纸厂的职工读报组就着手检查了他们厂里的浪费现象。像废纸片在过去是没有被利用的，现在每十天可以拾到一千多斤回炉生产；技术操作的改进，使纸的产量也提高了百分之七。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开展以后，各地读报组都能配合这个运动进行有计划的学习，某些组并积极地把自己从报上学得的东西，向群众进行宣传。如无锡市熙春街居民读报组，在读报时动员了很多群众来听报；黑板报由不定期出版改为每天出版；读报员并分头深入居民小组，搜集群众对这个运动的反映和检举、坦白有关贪污、漏税的材料。江阴小河乡曹家村读报组检举了当地一桩公粮舞弊的案件。苏南交通处“群联”读报组，检举了该处工程科第二工作组由于官僚主义浪费了一亿多元的事件。无锡市北塘街读报组长姜雨农，检举了矿油业某些资方逃税两亿七千万元的非法行为。
    三、读报组的组织形式，应按群众的自愿和便利生产来决定
    目前，读报组在工厂中是以生产小组为单位；农村里以互助组或民校为单位；学校以班级或学习小组为单位；市民中则以几个居民小组联合建立读报组为适宜。读报方法应按群众的具体情况，以“一读、二问、三讨论”为主，并适当地穿插问答、唱歌、说快板等方式。文化水平较高的读报组，则可用“分散读报、集体讨论”的办法。同时，要跟着新的情况和生产季节的变化，及时地改变读报组的组织形式及读报方法。如在农村里，原来以村为单位组成的读报组，在冬学开始后，就可把读报学习和冬学相结合；农闲时读报组织可以集中，农忙时则应田间休息时读报。
    在读报组中逐步地建立读报制度也是必要的。目前苏南大部分读报组都用民主讨论方式订了读报公约，这些公约进一步巩固了读报的热情。公约内容包括“遵守读报时间”、“不无故缺席”、“及时向领导机关和报社汇报情况”、“读报后要向群众宣传”等等。
