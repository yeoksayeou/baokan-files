    My Self-Criticism
    Ouyang Shan
    Editor's Note: The facts provided by the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaigns in literary and art institutions and organizations across the country prove that corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are equally serious in the literary and art sectors. Therefore, we must boldly mobilize the masses and earnestly launch this serious class struggle in the literary and art sectors. This is the primary task of the literary and art circles at present. Ouyang Shan, Chairman of the South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, has serious shortcomings and errors in his leadership of the South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Comrade Ouyang Shan has made a self-criticism. Although this self-criticism is not profound enough, the many erroneous thoughts and styles he has exposed are enough to arouse the vigilance of the literary and art circles.
    In the past two years, I have made very serious mistakes in my work. The specific manifestations of my mistakes are the failure to implement Chairman Mao's literary and art line, the failure to unite the literary and art circles well, the stagnation of creation, the failure to develop criticism and self-criticism, the failure to provide good learning and training for literary and art cadres and young people, the failure to improve the welfare of literary and art workers well, the serious corruption and waste in the organization, and the trend of personal life towards corruption. These mistakes have caused great losses to the Party and the people on the ideological front, and considerable losses to the country's financial economy.
    How were these mistakes caused? They were caused by my patriarchal rule in leadership style, aloofness, serious bureaucracy, subjectivism in thinking methods, and factionalism towards both internal and external affairs.
    I used to have an absurd idea. I thought that whether Chairman Mao's literary and art line could be implemented, whether the orientation of literature and art for workers, peasants, and soldiers could be realized, and whether the people's literary and art undertakings in South China could be developed, did not depend on anything else, but on whether I had cadres, money, and projects in my hands. It was this subjective, ego-centric idea that replaced the guiding principle of literary and art work in South China, and made me lead the literary and art work with patriarchal rule. During the time of the Military Control Commission's Literary and Art Department, there were only cadres, no money and projects. Later, when I became the President of the South China People's Literary and Art Institute and the Director of the Preparatory Committee of the South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, I had projects, so I transferred the cadres to those two projects, and put the People's, Leshan, and Southern theaters under the management and operation of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, thus having money. After that, many small projects were spread out in the two major projects of the Institute and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, such as the People's Theater Troupe, the Cantonese Opera Troupe, four kinds of magazines, cooperatives, art supply stores, and so on. Outside the two major projects, another large project was established, namely the Pearl River Film Studio. In addition, I also held many large projects concurrently, such as the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Literary and Art Workers' Union, and finally the work of the Department of Culture and Education. According to my own logic, since the literary and art work in South China had cadres, money, and projects, it should be able to develop smoothly. But the answer of the facts is the opposite: none of the work has been done well, and every work is getting worse and worse.
    This is because: with too many projects, there are not enough cadres, so we have to force a comrade to take on several jobs concurrently, and pull and drag them between several projects, so that they can not only not engage in creation and criticism, but also busy themselves with several administrative affairs all day long, resulting in ideological confusion, low morale, and great distress. As for myself, I am also busy to death, busy all day long consolidating old projects and establishing new projects. Although there is some money, it is not enough, and I am busy finding money to support the projects. In this way, my entire attention is focused on establishing new projects and managing theaters, completely abandoning ideological leadership, creative activities, and critical activities.
    At that time, I viewed the work steps in this way: the first step was to establish projects, do the work, and then gradually strengthen them; the second step was to train young people, so that after a short period of training, they could come out to support the work, and go to the countryside and factories to engage in creation; the third step was to extract the original literary and art cadres from the projects to engage in creation, or to go to the actual struggle to experience life, so that they could work with those young literary and art workers, and lead them to engage in creation, performance, publication, criticism and other activities. Now it seems that this step is obviously wrong, subjective, and puts the cart before the horse. Cadres are trapped in the projects and cannot be pulled out, and the problems are getting more and more, and cannot be solved at all. How can the work be strengthened? The People's Theater Troupe's unclear direction and work stagnation, and the Art Supply Store's wrong direction, corruption, and eventual dissolution are obvious examples. Secondly, cadres are trapped in the projects, busy day and night, and the experience they have gained from actual struggle has not been organized, so what can they use to train young people? And in the future, will these young comrades be able to bear the dual responsibility of doing administrative work and engaging in creation for everyone? Judging from the unclear nature of the Literary and Art Institute, the chaotic academic system, poor management, and the lack of serious reform of teaching content, it is probably difficult to achieve this goal. And furthermore, many comrades want to experience life, and many comrades have already experienced some life, and they require sufficient time to write, but they are limited by these steps, which actually obstructs creation.
    Naturally, the majority of comrades oppose my subjectivist, and violating Chairman Mao's literary and art line, principles and steps. My superiors also disagree with my principles and steps. According to the instructions of the superiors, I was required to adhere to ideological leadership, overcome pragmatism, and abandon some projects. According to the requirements of the comrades, it was necessary to immediately organize creation and launch critical activities. They are undoubtedly right, but I insisted on, and have been adhering to, my mistakes.
    In order to uphold my subjectivist error, to maintain my personal reputation, status, prestige, and dignity, I adopted the leadership method of patriarchal rule. First of all, since I use subjectivist fantasies and inspiration to establish work, I naturally think I am always right. For example: the foundation for the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to publish four kinds of magazines is very weak, but I insist on them being industrialized; I think of transferring that cadre and worker to that place, and I transfer them; I feel that that sum of money should be allocated to that place, and I allocate it there. This has led to financial chaos, unclear accounts, and violations of accounting systems and cash management systems in the units I am responsible for; I subjectively want to run an art cadre school, and a film studio, regardless of the conditions, I insist on setting them up. After they are set up, I fall into a state of being stretched to the limit, unable to extricate myself, let alone ideological leadership; I subjectively believe that it is necessary to solve the food and clothing expenses of all the students in the Literary and Art Institute, so I also take down the scholarships of the students who went to the countryside to participate in land reform and already had supplies, intending to distribute them to all the students on average. I also took all the literary and art education subsidies allocated to the Institute by the South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles to build dormitories, and so on. Secondly, if comrades have different opinions on what I have done, I not only do not listen to them, but also do not consider and adopt them. Instead, I use methods such as passing resolutions in the Party and outside the Party, individual conversations, clever defenses, strong arguments, superior decisions, and obedience to the organization to suppress criticism and suppress democracy. I often use superficial, perfunctory self-criticism to block the mouths of others, and even use the form of self-criticism to criticize others. In short, I want everyone to become cadres who only listen to my use and do not know how to think independently. I understand the principle that the petty bourgeoisie must undergo ideological transformation as a rigid dogma. When comrades criticize the Federation of Literary and Art Circles for not organizing creation, I reply that nothing can be discussed without ideological transformation. This bad leadership style of mine makes it impossible for me to recognize my mistakes for a long time, let alone correct them; it makes the comrades who work with me either obedient, or liberal, or both; finally, it makes me seriously detached from the masses and seriously detached from the cadres, becoming an aloof, thorough bureaucrat.
    Because I have such a leadership style and thinking method, it is inevitable to produce departmentalism, small-collective mentality, and factionalism. This is first manifested in my inability to correctly handle the relationship between this department and that department. I care about the work I am in charge of, and I don't care about the work others are in charge of. This is the case for the South China Cultural Workers Troupe, the Guangzhou Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the South China Film Management Company, and the Literary and Art Department of the Department of Culture and Education before July 1951. This is the real reason why I did not express my opinions on "Riding the Wind and Waves to Liberate Hainan," did not write articles for the "Guangzhou Workers' Literature and Art" magazine, and did not help the South China Film Management Company and the former Literary and Art Department of the Department of Culture and Education at all. This kind of factionalism also produces introversion and exclusion, so my unity with the broad literary and art circles is always not good. I did not unite well with external cadres such as Hong Cang, Ding Daming, and Wang Liuqiu, and with local cadres such as Fu Gongwang, Ding Bo, and Hua Jia. I also did not unite well with other literary and art figures such as Chen Zhuoyou, Xie Jia Yin, Huang Ruwen, and You Yunchang, causing them to either leave, or although they did not leave, they could not work with peace of mind. This kind of factionalism is also manifested in the issue of literary and art criticism. For example, I resisted and organized others to argue with the Southern Daily's criticism of the new Cantonese opera "Liu Yongfu." I did not dare to oppose the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy news published by the Southern Daily on January 11th, but I was very dissatisfied in my heart, thinking that the newspaper and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles had prejudices. For the "Blood Debt Must Be Paid" performed by the Guangzhou Ballad Troupe, because it was not the work I was in charge of, I exaggerated its shortcomings and criticized it very harshly.
    In addition, under this patriarchal, bureaucratic leadership, it is also inevitable to produce phenomena such as the failure to improve the welfare of literary and art workers well, the failure to care for the education and life of young students as it should, the serious corruption and waste in the organization, and the corruption of personal life, and so on. For example: I thought that I had taken care of the workers of the People's, Leshan, and Southern theaters, so I did not agree to their weekly supplementary work; for Lin Wenzhan, the gatekeeper of the Leshan Theater who insulted female workers and embezzled ticket money, I only gave him the punishment of dismissal, and did not educate him through the masses. The Party's decision on his punishment was also delayed; the issues of the graduation period and living treatment of the one-year students of the Literary and Art Institute could not be resolved for a long time. For some students who could not participate in land reform, I did not organize them to study, but only sent them out to work, or notified them to go home to rest; preliminary checks on organizational waste such as purchasing cars, purchasing houses, and entertaining guests amounted to about 400 million yuan. On the first day of the anti-corruption mobilization meeting, eight people voluntarily confessed, and the amount of embezzlement totaled more than 10 million yuan; according to preliminary checks, my personal life's over-standard expenditures amounted to about 12 million yuan in the past two years. Inside this, I also bought some foreign goods such as toothpaste. I drink alcohol at every banquet, and sometimes after getting drunk, I talk nonsense, shout and make noise, and lack restraint, and so on.
    Since my thoughts, standpoints, styles, and thinking methods are like this, it is of course impossible to lead everyone to draw a clear line between the ideologies of the working class and the petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie, it is impossible to study and practice Chairman Mao's literary and art principles and lines with everyone, it is impossible to create popular works for workers, peasants, and soldiers with everyone, and to use the working class's criticism and self-criticism to improve the political and ideological level of these works, it is impossible to unite the broad literary and art workers, it is impossible to fight for the education and welfare of workers and young people, and it is impossible to prevent organizational corruption and waste and personal extravagance and waste, enjoyment and corruption. In this way, it is bound to cause great ideological and material losses to the Party and the people. I am a Communist Party member, and also a cadre with leadership responsibility. To do such things that are completely incompatible with communism is truly unworthy of the Party, unworthy of the people, very painful, and very shameful.
    Where do the roots of these erroneous thoughts lie? They lie in my stubborn, petty-bourgeois, arrogant, selfish, and self-interested individualism. I grew up in a poor urban family, and I developed a selfish and self-interested ideology from an early age. I received feudal education and bourgeois education in my childhood, which deepened this ideology. Afterwards, I was influenced by imperialist films, Western European bourgeois literature, and Chinese petty-bourgeois individualist literature, which made me arrogant in addition to being selfish and self-interested. I have been engaged in writing for a long time, which has made me even more detached from the masses and conceited. After arriving in the Liberated Areas in 1940, I neither underwent any practical struggle training, nor systematically studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Although the organization gave me a lot of education, I accepted very little myself. That stubborn individualism that remained, when it encountered the fierce attack of bourgeois exploitation ideology after liberation, immediately relapsed, even intensified, gradually surrendered to the bourgeoisie, and became a captive of the bourgeoisie.
    Once this stubborn petty-bourgeois individualism rises and combines with the invading bourgeois exploitation ideology, it gradually distances me from the standpoint of the working class and moves towards the direction of opposing the Party, opposing the people, and opposing the working class. It is this exploitative class standpoint that has given rise to my meritorious service thinking, privilege thinking, bureaucratic airs, and self-importance, thereby forming my patriarchal rule, bureaucracy, subjectivism, factionalism, and extravagance and waste, enjoyment and corruption in life.
    However, at the beginning of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, I neither understood the central government's policies, nor recognized my own mistakes. I thought that I could get through by listing the figures of extravagance and waste, and then lightly reviewing my own bureaucracy. After three weeks of everyone's help, I realized the seriousness of my mistakes, and realized that if I did not immediately correct these mistakes, I could not stand in the ranks of the working class and march towards the broad road of socialism and communism.
    I sincerely accept the education and due punishment given to me by the Party and the masses. I guarantee to put down my airs, continue to constantly reflect, accept criticism, and conduct self-criticism regularly. I guarantee to do any work assigned to me by my superiors well, and I hope to go to the actual struggle to be tempered and transformed. I want to better study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and use the ideological weapons of the working class to fight against the bourgeoisie. I want to practice Chairman Mao's instructions: "Be modest and prudent, and guard against arrogance and impetuosity," and strive to abide by the law, obey discipline, and be honest and thrifty.
    Thank you to the Party and everyone for your help, which has given me the opportunity to transform. (Originally published in the Southern Daily on February 6th)

    我的检讨
    欧阳山
    编者按：各地文艺机关团体反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中所提供的事实证明：文艺部门中贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象同样是严重的。因此，在文艺部门中，必须放手发动群众，认真地展开这一严重的阶级斗争，这是当前文艺界的首要任务。华南文学艺术界联合会主席欧阳山在华南文联的领导工作上存在着严重的缺点和错误。欧阳山同志已作了自我检讨。这个检讨虽然还不够深刻，但就他所暴露的许多错误思想和作风来说，已足够引起文艺界的警惕。
    两年来，我在工作中犯了很严重的错误。我的错误的具体表现是没有贯彻毛主席的文艺路线，并使文艺界不能很好团结，创作不振，批评和自我批评不能展开，文艺干部和文艺青年得不到很好的学习和培养，文艺工人的福利得不到很好的改善，机关的贪污浪费很严重，个人的生活趋向腐化。这些错误造成了党和人民在思想战线上很大的损失，国家的财政经济上相当大的损失。
    这些错误是怎样造成的呢？是我领导作风上的家长式的统治，高高在上，严重的官僚主义，思想方法上的主观主义，和对内对外的宗派主义所造成的。
    我过去有一种荒谬的想法。我以为毛主席的文艺路线能否贯彻，工农兵文艺方向能否实现，华南的人民文艺事业能否开展，不用依靠什么别的，就看我手上有没有干部、金钱和摊子。就是这种主观主义的、个人中心的想法代替了华南文艺工作的方针，使我用家长式的统治来领导文艺工作。在军管会文艺处的时候只有干部，没有金钱和摊子。后来我当了华南人民文学艺术学院院长和华南文学艺术界联合会筹备会主任，有了摊子，我就把干部调到那两个摊子上，又把人民、乐善、南方三个戏院放在文学艺术界联合会的管理和经营之下，这样又有了金钱。此后在学院和文学艺术界联合会两大摊子中又铺开了许多小摊子，像人民剧团、粤剧团、四种杂志、合作社、美术供应社等等。在两大摊子之外，又搞了一个大摊子，即珠江制片厂，此外还兼了许多大摊子，如中苏友好协会、文艺工会，最后还兼了文教厅的工作。按照我自己的逻辑，华南的文艺工作既有了干部、金钱、摊子，应该可以顺利开展了。但事实的回答是相反的：任何一个工作都没有做好，并且任何一个工作都越弄越糟。
    这是因为：摊子多了，干部不够，只好逼着要一个同志兼几样工作，并且在几个摊子之间乱拉乱扯，使他们不只不能从事创作和批评，就是整天忙于几头行政事务，结果连行政事务也做不好，思想混乱，情绪低落，苦闷得很。我自己呢，也是忙得要死，整天忙于巩固旧摊子，建立新摊子。钱虽然有了一些，但是不够，又忙于找钱养摊子。这样，就使得我的全部注意力集中在建立新摊子和管理戏院上面，完全放弃了思想领导、创作活动、批评活动。
    当时在工作步骤上我是这样看的：第一步是建立摊子，把工作做出来，再慢慢加强；第二步是培养青年，使他们受很短的训练之后，便出来支持工作，并下乡下厂，从事创作；第三步才是把原来的文艺干部从摊子中抽出来，从事创作，或到实际斗争当中去体验生活，以便和那些文艺青年一起，并带领他们从事创作、演出、出版、批评等活动。现在看起来，这个步骤显然是错误的，主观的，本末倒置的。干部陷在摊子之中，拔不出来，问题越弄越多，一点也得不到解决，工作如何能加强？像人民剧团的方针不明，工作停顿；像美术供应社的方针错误，贪污腐化，最后不得不解散，都是明显的例子。其次，干部一方面陷在摊子之中，日夜忙碌，一方面本来已经从实际斗争中获得的经验，又未曾整理出来，拿什么东西去培养青年？而将来这些青年同志，是否能把代替大家做行政工作、从事创作的双重责任负担起来？按照文艺学院的性质不明，学制混乱，管理不善，教学内容没有认真改革等情形看来，恐怕很难达到这个目的。而又其次，许多同志要去体验生活，许多同志已经体验过一些生活，要求充分的时间来写作，都被这样的步骤所限制了，实际上是阻塞了创作。
    自然，大多数的同志是反对我这个主观主义、违反毛主席的文艺路线的方针和步骤的。我的上级也是不同意我的方针和步骤的。按上级的指示，是要我坚持思想领导，克服事务主义，放弃一些摊子。按同志们的要求，是要立刻组织创作，展开批评活动。他们无疑是对的，而我坚持了、并且一直坚持着我的错误。
    为了坚持我的主观主义的错误，维护我个人的名誉地位、威信尊严，我采用了家长统治的领导方法。首先，既然我用主观主义的幻想和灵感来建立工作，我当然一切都自以为是。例如：文联出版四种杂志的基础是很薄弱的，我硬要他们企业化；我想起把那个干部和工友调到那里就调到那里；我觉得应该把那笔钱拨到那里就拨那里，这就出现了我负责的单位的财经混乱，账目不清，并且违反会计制度、现金管理制度的局面；我主观要办一个艺术干部学校，要办一个电影制片厂，就不管条件如何，硬要办起来，办起来之后就陷于左支右撑，不能自拔，更谈不到思想领导；我主观认为必须解决文艺学院全院同学的膳费衣着，就把下乡参加土地改革，已有供给的同学的助学金也领下来，打算匀给全体同学平均使用，又把华南文学艺术界联合会拨给学院的文艺教育补助费全部拿去建筑宿舍等等。其次，同志们如果对我的所做所为有了不同的意见，我不但不去倾听，不但不加考虑和采纳，反而在党内党外都用会议通过，个别谈话，巧言辩护，强词夺理，上级决定，服从组织等等方法来压制批评，压制民主。我经常用轻描淡写，敷衍应付的自我批评去堵塞别人的嘴巴，甚至用自我批评的形式去批评别人。总之，我要大家变成只听我使用，不会独立思考问题的干部。我把小资产阶级必须经过思想改造的道理当做一种僵硬的教条来理解，遇着同志们批评文联没有组织创作的时候，我便回答没有经过思想改造，一切都谈不上。我这种恶劣的领导作风使我对自己的错误长期不能认识，更谈不到改正；使和我一起工作的同志们变成或者唯唯诺诺，或者自由主义，或者两者兼而有之；最后，使我既严重地脱离了群众，又严重地脱离了干部，变成一个高高在上，十足的官僚主义者。
    因为我有了这样的领导作风和思想方法，不可避免地要产生本位主义、小公家思想和宗派主义。这首先表现在我不能正确处理这一部门和那一部门的关系上。对自己管的工作就关心，对别人管的工作就不关心。对华南文工团、广州市文学艺术界联合会、华南影片经理公司，一九五一年七月以前的文教厅文艺处，都是如此。这就是为什么对“乘风破浪解放海南”我没有发表意见，对“广州工人文艺”杂志我没有写稿，对华南影片经理公司和以前的文教厅文艺处没有丝毫帮助的真正原因。这种宗派主义又产生排内性和排外性，所以我和广大文艺界的团结老是搞不好。和外来干部如洪藏、丁达明、王流秋，和本地干部如符公望、丁波、华嘉等都团结得不好。和其他文艺界人士如陈卓猷、谢加因、黄如文、游允常等，也都团结得不好，使他们或者离开，或者虽未离开而不能安心工作。这种宗派主义还表现在对待文艺批评的问题上，如南方日报批评新粤剧“刘永福”，我是抗拒并组织别人和他们争论的，对南方日报一月十一日发表的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义新闻，我口头上不敢反对，心里面很不满意，以为报馆和文联有成见，对广州曲艺大队排演的“血债血还”，我因为不是自己所管的工作，就夸大它的缺点，把它批评得很厉害。
    此外，在这种家长统治、官僚主义的领导下面，还不可避免地要产生文艺工人的福利得不到很好改善，青年同学的教育和生活得不到应有的关心，机关的贪污浪费严重，个人的生活腐化等等现象。例如：对人民、乐善、南方三个戏院的工友我自以为曾有过一些照顾，便没有同意他们的星期补工；对乐善戏院的守闸林文战侮辱女工，贪污票款，我只给以撤职处分，没有通过群众来教育他，党内对他的处分也迟迟未有决定；对文艺学院一年制的同学的毕业期间和生活待遇问题，长久不能解决，对一些不能参加土地改革的同学，没有组织他们学习，只是派他们出去工作，或通知他们回家休息；机关浪费初步检查如购买汽车，购买房屋，请客招待等即达四亿元左右。第一天反贪污动员大会上自动坦白的即有八个人，贪污数目合计一千万元以上；我个人生活的超制度支出据初步检查两年来共达一千二百万元左右，这里面还买了一些牙膏之类的外国货，每次宴会都喝酒，有时喝醉后胡言乱语，大叫大闹，不够检点等等。
    我的思想、立场、作风和思想方法既然如此，当然没有可能领导大家来划清工人阶级和小资产阶级、资产阶级的思想界限，没有可能和大家一起来学习和实践毛主席的文艺方针和路线，没有可能和大家一起来创作为工农兵的普及作品，并用工人阶级的批评和自我批评来提高这些作品的政治水平和思想水平，没有可能团结广大的文艺工作者，没有可能为工人和青年的教育和福利而奋斗，没有可能防止机关的贪污浪费和个人的铺张浪费，享乐腐化。这样，就必然使党和人民在思想上和物质上受到极大的损失。我是一个共产党员，又是一个负领导责任的干部，做出这种和共产主义绝不相容的事来，真是对不起党，对不起人民，十分痛心，十分可耻。
    这些错误的思想根源在于什么地方呢？在于我的顽固的、小资产阶级的、自高自大、自私自利的个人主义。我生长在城市贫民的家庭，从小就养成自私自利的思想意识。幼年受封建教育和资产阶级教育，加深了这种思想意识。往后又受帝国主义电影，西欧资产阶级文学和中国小资产阶级个人主义文学的影响，使我在自私自利之外，加上自高自大。又加上我曾长期从事写作生活，更使我脱离群众，妄自尊大。一九四○年到解放区以后，既没有经过什么实际斗争的锻炼，又没有系统地学过马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。虽然组织上给我的教育很多，但我自己接受的很少。那保留下来的、顽固的个人主义一碰到解放后资产阶级剥削思想的猛烈进攻，立刻就故态复萌，甚至变本加厉，逐渐向资产阶级投降，成为资产阶级的俘虏。
    这种顽固的小资产阶级个人主义一经抬头，并和侵袭来的资产阶级剥削思想结合之后，就使我逐渐离开工人阶级的立场，向着反对党、反对人民、反对工人阶级的方向走去。正是这种剥削阶级的立场，使我产生了功臣思想，特权思想，官僚架子，唯我独尊，从而形成了我的家长统治，官僚主义，主观主义，宗派主义，和生活上的铺张浪费，享乐腐化等丑恶现象。
    但在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开头的时候，我既不了解中央的政策，也不认识自己的错误，以为把铺张浪费的数字开列出来，再轻轻检讨一下自己的官僚主义，就可以过关。经过大家三个星期的帮助以后，才认识自己错误的严重性，才知道不立刻改正这些错误，就不能置身在工人阶级的行列中，向社会主义和共产主义的大路迈进。
    我诚心诚意接受党和群众给我的教育和应得的处分。我保证放下架子，继续不断地经常反省，接受批评并经常进行自我批评。我保证做好上级分配给我的任何工作，并希望能到实际斗争中去锻炼改造。我要更好地学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，拿工人阶级的思想武器去和资产阶级作战。我要实践毛主席的指示：“谦虚谨慎，不骄不躁”，并做到奉公守法，服从纪律，廉洁俭朴。
    感谢党和大家给我的帮助，使我获得改造的机会。（原载二月六日南方日报）
