    There's a small incident: Deputy Section Chief Chen Shijie, while riding his bicycle, realized he had lost his key. He casually picked up a rock from the ground and smashed the lock. Getting a new one would cost 70,000 yuan. Section Chief Cao Zelei was extremely upset when he heard about this and criticized Chen Shijie to his face. At the section meeting, Cao Zelei said, "Section Chief Chen's one rock smashed away two dan (approximately 200 lbs) of grain from the peasants!"

    Cao Zelei, this Communist Party member who has gone through twenty-four years of revolutionary struggle, was met with boundless respect and praise from all staff at the recent Wuhan Public Security Bureau's conference on opposing corruption, opposing waste, and opposing bureaucracy.

    Cao Zelei joined the Communist Party in 1927 and participated in the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's Long March. He is fifty-nine years old this year. Under the Party's guidance for over twenty years, he has become an outstanding Communist Party member who deeply cherishes state property.

    In May 1950, Cao Zelei was transferred to the Wuhan Public Security Bureau as the head of the Administration Section. Before he started working in the Administration Section, the section's financial system was very chaotic. Office expenses, water and electricity bills, and miscellaneous expenses exceeded the budget every month, and the waste of water and electricity was particularly shocking. In February 1950 alone, the electricity bill amounted to 34 million yuan, exceeding the prescribed electricity consumption by more than seven times. Cao Zelei felt very sad and thought, "In the past, during the Long March and when fighting guerrillas against the enemy, we protected any public property with our lives. Now that the revolution has just succeeded, some comrades are wasting the fruits of the people's labor like this. How can we be worthy of our country!" He decided to systematically oppose all kinds of wasteful behavior. First, he formulated a plan to save water and, through his own exemplary actions, quickly promoted this plan in various units. He bought over a thousand light bulbs with 25 to 40 candlepower and, together with the administrator, went to various units to replace the bulbs with 80 candlepower or higher, and also confiscated the most power-consuming private electric stoves. At the same time, he was diligent in inspection; even in the freezing cold of late night, he often got out of bed to check all parts of the agency. Through his hard work, by June of last year, the Wuhan Public Security Bureau's electricity expenditure had dropped to more than 6 million yuan; according to this standard, Cao Zelei saved 300 million yuan for the state every year.

    Cao Zelei often struggled with staff members who wasted state property. In July last year, when the Wuhan Public Security Bureau's Second Division was holding a meeting, it asked the Administration Section to buy 120 commemorative albums and specified that they should be worth 14,000 yuan each. However, Cao Zelei only bought albums worth 5,700 yuan each, thus saving the state 999,600 yuan. One section had only forty staff members, but used more than fifty bottles of paste every week. After investigation, Cao Zelei found that fourteen bottles were enough.

    These kinds of things once caused some comrades to be dissatisfied. They said, "Old Section Chief, we are living in Western-style buildings and using electric lights now! Broaden your horizons a bit; why be so stingy?" Cao Zelei immediately refuted this absurd theory of "generously" squandering state money. He said, "I am a Communist Party member, and I cannot stand by and watch others waste state wealth!"

    Inspired by Cao Zelei's spirit of cherishing state property, comrades finally gradually learned to be thrifty. Therefore, from the time Cao Zelei took over as section chief in May of the year before last until now, the Wuhan Public Security Bureau's office expenses, water and electricity bills, miscellaneous expenses, etc., have never exceeded the budget, and there has been a surplus every month.

    Cao Zelei never retreated in the face of hardship and difficulty, and always took the lead. One morning last winter, he braved the wind, snow, and severe cold to go on a business trip to Chadian, sixty miles away from Hankou, and he rushed back that night. Comrades asked, "Old Section Chief, why didn't you ask the leaders to send a car to take you?" He replied with a smile, "That would cost gasoline!" Last November, a large amount of charcoal was transported, and he took the lead in carrying it, and patiently swept up the crushed charcoal and charcoal dust for storage. He gave the whole pieces of charcoal to others, and used the charcoal dust to keep himself warm.

    Cao Zelei rarely considered personal matters. Once, in order to take care of his health, the comrades exchanged the thirty jin of coarse rice he was entitled to for white flour and sent it to him. He immediately carried it back himself, pointing out, "This is a violation of the system." Sometimes, comrades pointed to his old coat and said, "Old Section Chief, get a new coat!" He always smiled and said, "This was specially awarded to me by the Party. What kind of coat is warmer and more glorious than this!" Cao Zelei's every word and action had a great impact on his comrades. Now, in the Administration Section under his direct leadership, all staff members can be diligent and thrifty in their work, take the lead in everything, give the good things to others, and keep the bad things for themselves.

    热爱国家财产的共产党员曹泽雷
    新华社记者  万农
    有这么一件小事：副科长陈世杰骑脚踏车时，一摸发现钥匙掉了，就随手从地上拾起一块石头，把锁砸坏了。再配一把，得七万元。科长曹泽雷听说这件事非常恼火，当面批评了陈世杰。在科务会议上，曹泽雷说：“陈科长一石头，砸掉了农民两担谷子！”
    曹泽雷，这个身经二十四年革命斗争的共产党员，在最近武汉市公安总局召开的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义大会上，受到全体工作人员的无比尊敬、赞扬。
    曹泽雷是一九二七年加入共产党的，参加过中国工农红军的二万五千里长征，今年五十九岁。二十多年来，在党的教养下，他已成为一个高度热爱国家财产的优秀的共产党员。
    一九五零年五月间，曹泽雷被调到武汉市公安总局任管理科长。他到管理科工作前，管理科的财政制度非常混乱，办公费、水电费、杂费月月超支，水电的浪费更是惊人。仅一九五零年二月份，电费就花了三千四百万元，超过规定用电量七倍以上。曹泽雷非常难过地想：“过去在长征中，在和敌人打游击时期，我们对公家任何东西都用生命去保护它。现在革命刚刚胜利，有些同志就这样浪费人民的劳动果实，怎么对得起我们的国家！”他决定有计划地反对各种浪费行为。首先，他制订了节约水的计划，并以自己的模范行动，很快地在各个单位推行了这个计划。他买了一千多个二十五支光到四十支光的灯泡，和管理员一起到各单位把八十度以上的灯泡都换了下来，并且收回了耗电最大的私用电炉。同时，他又勤于检查；就是在酷寒的深夜里，他也经常从被窝里爬起来，到机关各处察看。经过他的艰苦努力，到去年六月份，武汉市公安总局电费支出已经下降到六百多万元；按这个标准计算，曹泽雷每年就为国家节省了三亿元。
    曹泽雷经常和浪费国家财物的工作人员进行斗争。去年七月，武汉市公安总局第二处在召开会议时，要管理科买一百二十本纪念册，并且指定要买一万四千元一本的。可是曹泽雷只买了五千七百元一本的，因此为国家节省了九十九万六千元。某科只有四十多个工作人员，每星期却要用五十多瓶浆糊。曹泽雷一调查，发现十四瓶就够了。
    这类事情曾经引起有些同志的不满，他们说：“老科长，现在我们是住洋楼、点电灯啦！眼睛放远些，何必那样小气呢？”曹泽雷马上批驳了这种挥霍国家钱财的“大方”谬论。他说：“我是个共产党员，我不能看着别人浪费国家财富不管！”
    在曹泽雷热爱国家财产的精神感召下，同志们终于渐渐地学会了精打细算，因此，从前年五月曹泽雷接任科长时起，直到目前为止，武汉市公安总局的办公费、水电费、杂费等从未超支，而且月月都有结余。
    曹泽雷遇到艰苦困难从不退缩，总是带头干。去年冬天的一个早晨，他冒着风雪的严寒，出差到离汉口六十里的察甸去，当晚他又赶了回来。同志们问：“老科长，为什么不请首长派车子送你呢？”他笑眯眯地回答：“那得花汽油呵！”去年十一月，大批木炭运到了，他带头搬运，并且耐心地把碎炭和炭屑扫起，储藏起来。他把整块的炭发给别人，自己用炭屑烤火。
    曹泽雷很少考虑到个人的问题。有一次，同志们为了照顾他的健康，把他应领的三十斤糙米换成了白面送到他那里，他立即亲自背了回去，指出：“这是违犯制度的。”有时，同志们指着他那件旧大衣说：“老科长，换一件大衣吧？”他总是笑笑说：“这是党特别奖给我的，还有什么样的大衣比它更温暖、更荣耀呢！”曹泽雷的一言一动，在同志间发生了很大的影响。现在，在他直接领导下的管理科，所有工作人员都能在工作中做到勤俭艰苦，事事带头，好的发给别人，坏的留给自己。
