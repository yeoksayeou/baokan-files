Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions in the People's Daily

    To the Editor:
    The People's Daily reader exposed on December 20, 1951, that the leading cadres of the Changshan Island Special District granary had serious bureaucratism, resulting in a large amount of grain rotting. After our investigation, a total of more than 3,140 catties of grain rotted in the granary of this district, more than 56,830 catties became inedible (can be sold at one-third lower than the market price), and more than 45,100 catties were of deteriorating quality but still edible. The direct reason for the grain rotting was certainly the negligence of duty by the custodians, who were not responsible for state property and the people's cause. But more importantly, it was the serious bureaucratism of Gao Xiquan, the director of the granary, who failed to conduct in-depth inspections of the work and abandoned ideological leadership over his subordinates. Before the incident, he did not make thorough inspections. After the incident, he did not learn from the experience and educate everyone to raise their vigilance, resulting in continuous rotting of grain and serious damage to state property. This is not permissible. The Discipline Inspection Committee of the CPC Laiyang Prefectural Committee and the People's Supervision Office of the Laiyang Special District have decided to punish the derelict personnel.

    检查处理长山岛特区粮库霉烂粮食的事件
    编辑同志：一九五一年十二月二十日人民日报的读者揭发了长山岛特区粮库领导干部有严重的官僚主义，造成大批粮食霉烂的事件。经我们调查，这个区的粮库共霉烂粮食三千一百四十多斤，变质不能食用的有五万六千八百三十多斤（可低于市价的三分之一卖出），虽已变质但尚能食用的有四万五千一百多斤。粮食霉烂的直接原因，固然是保管人员玩忽职守，对国家资财、对人民事业不负责任，但更重要的，是粮库主任高锡泉的严重的官僚主义，对工作不进行深入检查，放弃了对下级干部的思想领导。事件发生之前，他没有抓紧检查，事件发生之后，他也没有接受教训，教育大家，提高警惕，致使霉烂粮食的事情不断发生，使国家资财受到严重损失。这是不能容许的。中共莱阳地委纪律检查委员会和莱阳专署人民监察处已决定对失职人员给予处分。
