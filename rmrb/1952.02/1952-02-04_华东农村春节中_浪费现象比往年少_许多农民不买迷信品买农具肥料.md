    During the Spring Festival in rural East China, wasteful practices have decreased compared to previous years due to the increased production and frugality campaign. In Dongshan Village, Hang County, Zhejiang Province, farmers have abandoned superstitious customs and refrained from buying incense, candles, paper money, and other superstitious items. Before the Spring Festival, Dongshan Village established a "Spring Festival Increased Production and Frugality Pact" with four "mores" and four "lesses." The four "mores" are: buy more farm tools, buy more fertilizer, repair farm tools more, and accumulate more fertilizer. The four "lesses" are: eat less fish and meat, drink less alcohol, visit tea houses less, and smoke less. The women of Dongshan Village also created a Spring Festival increased production and frugality plan to buy less makeup and weave more cloth, aiming to save 30,000 yuan per person. By simply not buying superstitious items, Dongshan Village saved more than 6 million yuan this time. Mo Afu, a farmer who had been liberated, used the money he saved from this Spring Festival to buy 1,200 jin of oil cakes and 100 jin of fertilizer. He happily said, "I also raised seven sheep, which can accumulate a lot of manure every month, so I won't lack fertilizer for farming this year." Xie Chenggui's mutual aid team in He County, Northern Anhui, carefully reviewed their winter production plan before the Spring Festival. The results of the review showed that they had completed the production tasks as planned, such as winter plowing, fertilizer accumulation, pond and dam repair, flour milling, tofu making, and fishing, but they had not accumulated much capital for expanded reproduction. Their winter production income was wasted on gift-giving and other things, amounting to more than 2 million yuan. After hearing the news of the volunteer soldiers rescuing ammunition from the fire, they deeply felt that they should not waste money like this. This year, they established a team-wide increased production and frugality plan for the Spring Festival. Xie Chenggui used the money he saved from this Spring Festival to buy three sets of waterwheel levers, two manure baskets, and two piglets. Team member Lu Chuiwang also used the saved incense and paper money fees to buy a rice basket and manure basket, and a large shovel and iron hoe. He happily said, "In the past, I spent money to send off the God of Wealth every year, but this year I am spending money to improve the land."

    华东农村春节中  
    浪费现象比往年少  
    许多农民不买迷信品买农具肥料
    在增产节约运动中，这次春节华东农村中的浪费现象比往年减少了。浙江省杭县东山村的农民在这次过春节时都废除了迷信的风俗，没有买香烛钱纸等迷信品。东山村在春节前就订了一个四多四少的
    “春节增产节约公约”。四多是：多买农具，多买肥料，多修农具，多积肥料；四少是：少吃鱼肉，少喝酒，少上茶馆，少吸烟。东山村的妇女们也订了一个少买脂粉多织布，争取每人节省三万元的春节增产节约计划。单不买迷信品一项，东山村这次就节省了六百多万元。翻身农民莫阿富把这次过春节节省的钱，买了一千二百斤油饼和一百斤肥田粉。他高兴地说：“我还养了七只羊，每月可积不少羊粪，今年种田不缺肥料了。”皖北区和县的谢成贵互助组，春节前认真地检查了一遍他们的冬季生产计划。检查的结果：生产方面如冬耕、积肥、修塘打坝、磨粉、磨豆腐、捕鱼捞虾等都按计划完成了，但是，扩大再生产的资金却积累不多。冬季生产的收入，被他们送喜礼等等浪费了二百多万元。他们听到志愿军从火里抢救弹药的消息后，特别深刻地感到不应该这样浪费。今年过春节，他们就订了一个全组的增产节约计划。谢成贵这次就用过春节节省的钱，买了三副水车杆、两副粪筐和两只小猪。组员鲁垂旺也把节约的香纸费买了稻萝、粪筐各一副，大锹、铁锄各一把。他高兴地说：“过去每年花钱送财神，今年花钱兴土地了。”  （新华社）
