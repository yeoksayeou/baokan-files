    Serious Wasteful Practices

    To the Editor: Over the past two and a half years, Northern Jiaotong University's Tangshan Institute of Technology has wasted 1.5 billion yuan, causing serious losses to the people. According to preliminary statistics, waste in basic construction amounted to 1.1 billion yuan, mostly due to poor planning and inadequate supervision. Waste caused by stockpiled funds is also very serious. Last year, our school purchased 2.5 billion yuan worth of building materials, which are still stockpiled at the construction site and have not been used. Leaders of various departments have departmentalism tendencies. When preparing budgets, they do not start from actual needs, nor do they consider the current economic situation of the country, but only seek more is better. As soon as the funds are in hand, they immediately purchase indiscriminately; if necessities cannot be bought, they buy spare parts, and even buy unnecessary things. They hold the thought that they can just use it up and then be reimbursed. Take the experimental drugs in the chemical laboratory as an example, one of the drugs is enough for thirty years of use. At the same time, due to the irresponsibility of the purchasing personnel, the Department of Chemical Engineering actually bought a lot of unusable calcium chloride, wasting more than 20 million yuan. When using public property, there was no careful calculation, and a total of 400 million yuan was wasted in this area in the past two and a half years, of which water and electricity costs alone wasted 100 million yuan, and mimeographing costs wasted 30 million yuan. Only one student in the fourth grade of the Department of Metallurgy chose to study smelting, but the leadership wrote lectures for him alone, which was a great waste. There are also extravagant phenomena in our school, such as donation commemorative badges when donating planes and cannons; internship commemorative badges when going to factories for internships; and commemorative badges when holding cross-country races. Our school also blindly purchases land, and now there are 180 acres of land in the school that have been abandoned and unused for many years. The corruption in our school is also serious. We hope that these problems will be thoroughly resolved in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement.

### 北方交通大学唐山工学院  铺张浪费现象严重

    铺张浪费现象严重
    编辑同志：北方交通大学唐山工学院两年半来浪费了十五亿元，给人民造成了严重的损失。据初步统计，基本建设方面的浪费达十一亿元，大都是因为计划不周，监督不力造成的。由积压资金所造成的浪费现象也很严重。去年我校购买建筑材料值二十五亿元，至今尚积压在工地，没有动用。各系领导方面有本位主义思想，开预算时，不从实际需要出发，也不考虑国家目前的经济情况，只求越多越好，经费一到手，立即乱购乱买；必需品买不到，就买备用品，甚至把不必要的东西也买了回来。他们抱着用完了就报销的思想。拿化学实验室试验药品来说，其中有一种药品足够三十年使用。同时由于采购人员的不负责任，化工系竟买了很多不能用的氯化钙，浪费了两千多万元。在使用公物时，没有实行精打细算的办法，两年半来在这方面共浪费了四亿元，其中水电费一项就浪费了一亿元，油印费也浪费了三千万元。冶金系四年级只有一个同学选修冶炼学，但领导方面为他一个人刻写讲义，浪费很大。我校还有铺张的现象，如捐献飞机大炮时有捐献纪念章；下厂实习时有工作纪念章；举行越野赛时又发纪念章。我校同时又盲目地购买土地，现在校内有一百八十亩的土地长年弃置不用。我校的贪污现象也是严重的。我们希望，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中彻底解决这些问题。
