    It is necessary to provide correct technical guidance to farmers
    With the continuous improvement of agricultural production and the rising enthusiasm of farmers, their demand for technical guidance in production is becoming increasingly urgent. For example, in fertilization, due to the increase in farmers' production investment, they not only want to increase the application of coarse manure, but also want to increase the application of fine manure (such as bean cake fertilizer and chemical fertilizer). However, because farmers do not correctly grasp the fertilization techniques, the result is often reduced production due to excessive fertilization. Therefore, how to guide farmers to correctly and rationally apply fertilizer is a problem that local agricultural experiment and research institutions must quickly solve. After farmers increase the application of fertilizer, how other technologies should be appropriately coordinated, and other issues, should also be proposed for research when summarizing bumper harvest experiences, and gradually tested, researched, and resolved in the next two or three years. In this way, we can meet the bumper harvest requirements of the masses of farmers and lead them to strive to increase yields per unit area!
    In the work of investigating bumper harvest models and summarizing bumper harvest experiences, local agricultural administrative leading organs and agricultural technology research organs should not only summarize the typical bumper harvest experiences, but also summarize the causes and lessons of production reduction, and combine the scientific experiments of local farms to identify important technical factors for increasing yields per unit area in the area, so as to provide correct technical guidance to farmers. For technologies that are not currently fully grasped, they must first be studied by experimental research institutions before being blindly promoted, so as to avoid making mistakes in technical guidance work and causing unnecessary losses to the masses.

    要对农民进行正确的技术指导
    随着农业生产的不断提高，农民生产情绪的高涨，农民对生产技术指导的要求是越来越迫切了。例如施肥，由于农民对生产投资的增加，农民不但要增施粗肥，而且要增施细肥（如豆饼肥料、化学肥料）。但因为农民没有正确地掌握施肥技术，结果常因施肥过多反而减产。因此，如何指导农民正确合理施用肥料，是各地的农业试验研究机关必须迅速加以解决的问题。农民增施肥料后，其他各种技术应如何适当地配合等问题，也都应在总结丰产经验时提出研究，并在最近二、三年内逐步地加以试验研究和解决。这样，我们才能满足农民群众的丰产要求，才能领导农民为提高单位面积产量而奋斗！
    各地农业行政领导机关和农业技术研究机关，在调查丰产典型和总结丰产经验的工作中，不仅要总结典型的丰产经验，也要总结减产的原因和教训，并结合各地农场的科学试验，找出当地提高单位面积产量的重要的技术因素，以便对农民进行正确的技术指导。对目前没有十分把握的技术，必须先由试验研究机关加以研究，不要盲目推广，以免在技术指导工作中犯错误，造成群众不应有的损失。
