    The Unbreakable Friendship of the Mongolian and Soviet Peoples
    Daerharebu, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the Mongolian People's Republic in China
    February 27th this year marks the sixth anniversary of the signing of the historically significant Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Economic and Cultural Cooperation between the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union.
    Deeply inspired by the world-historical victories of the Soviet Union in its struggle for the triumph of communism and deeply inspired by its comprehensive fraternal assistance, the Mongolian people, with deep gratitude to the Soviet Union, greet this historically significant day – a true all-people's festival in our country amidst a great political and labor upsurge.
    A clear example of this is the preparation and holding of the Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Month, the most significant and joyous event in the lives of the Mongolian people after the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution. The revolutionary competition held in our country for the Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Month has reached a grand scale. Joy and delight are everywhere. For every worker in our country, there is nothing more sacred than commemorating this festival with new labor victories.
    The Mongolian people are well aware that only friendship with the advanced socialist country in the world can guarantee our country's freedom and independence, and can guarantee its continued development and prosperity on the road to socialism.
    Our wise and beloved leader, Marshal Choibalsan, has taught us throughout his life to do our utmost to consolidate the unbreakable friendship with the great Soviet people; this friendship is a reliable guarantee of our motherland's prosperity. Comrade Choibalsan was an ardent fighter for consolidating Soviet-Mongolian friendship with all his strength, and regarded this as the bright future of the Mongolian people. In a telegram to Marshal Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Socialist Republics, on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Revolution, Marshal Choibalsan expressed the will of the Mongolian people, writing: "In the thirty years of their independent existence, under the leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Mongolian people have achieved significant successes in building their country and developing its economy and culture; they realize more deeply year by year that they owe their independence, freedom and happiness first of all to the comprehensive fraternal assistance and support of the great Soviet Union, and to your, dear Comrade Stalin's, constant concern for our people."
    The traditional friendship with the Soviet Union established by the great leaders and teachers of the Mongolian people, Sukhe-Bator and Choibalsan, is being consolidated day by day, and this friendship demonstrates its beneficial influence everywhere in the development of economic, political and cultural life.
    The Mongolian people have achieved unprecedented national achievements in all sectors of the national economy and culture, which have been made possible only by the victory of the people's democratic system in our country, by the constant and selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union, and by the fatherly care of the great Stalin for our people. With the constant assistance of the fraternal Soviet people, the basic sector of our economy—animal husbandry—has taken a big step forward, and we have also established our own national industry and are laying a solid foundation for the development of heavy industry. The welfare of our workers is growing day by day, which is also causing a continuous increase in their cultural needs. The emergence and growth of a new working class and national intelligentsia are major achievements of our country.
    The Soviet Union's selfless and generous assistance is manifested not only in material and technical assistance, but also in the heroic deeds of Soviet experts who, implementing the instructions of Comrade Stalin, a close friend and teacher of the Mongolian people, teach us to build a new life and impart their rich knowledge and experience in building socialism to us. We express our warm gratitude for everything they have done and will do for our people and for consolidating the friendship between our two peoples. The Soviet Union's experience in building socialism has greatly facilitated and accelerated our movement towards socialism. The desire to learn from the great friend—the Soviet Union—and to consolidate the friendship with the Soviet Union more closely is growing unabated. In this regard, one fact can serve as an example: in the past year alone, many delegations from all walks of life in our country have visited the Soviet Union to study the experience of Soviet economic and cultural construction.
    Thus, the Soviet Union's comprehensive assistance to our people – which is a practical manifestation of the Mongolian-Soviet friendship established since 1921 – is the decisive factor in our own visible economic and cultural achievements.
    Friendship with the Soviet Union is of decisive significance for the security and independent existence of our motherland. The thirty years of existence of the independent Mongolian state in close friendship with the Soviet Union is one of the vivid examples of the actual embodiment of the genuine principles of the Lenin-Stalin foreign policy, which safeguards the full equality and autonomy of large and small nations. Never in the entire history of Mongolia has there been such a just friendship and fraternal mutual assistance as the Mongolian-Soviet friendship. The Mongolian-Soviet friendship was tested and demonstrated its strong and vigorous force in the struggle of Mongolia and the Soviet Union against the instigators of the Second World War - German and Japanese imperialists. This friendship has been a reliable guarantee for our country against Japanese imperialist aggression more than once.
    The friendship between the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Union is of great significance in maintaining peace and security in the Far East. In a telegram to Marshal Choibalsan on the first anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Economic and Cultural Cooperation between Mongolia and the Soviet Union, Comrade Stalin wrote: "These historical documents are a major contribution to the cause of defending peace and security in the Far East and a solid foundation for further developing the friendly relations between our two countries."
    Thanks to the great friendship with the Soviet Union, our people are expanding friendly relations with the people's democratic countries, our international position is being consolidated day by day, and our international prestige is increasing day by day. In this regard, the world-historical victory of the great Chinese people and the founding of the People's Republic of China are of decisive significance.
    The founding of the People's Republic of China and its great friendship with the Soviet Union are of great significance to our country, and the peace-loving people of the world also rely on the historically significant Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Union and China in their common struggle for peace; it is a fatal blow to imperialism.
    The imperialist war instigators are carrying out bloody intervention against the peace-loving Korean people, and they are encountering the insurmountable resistance of the Chinese People's Volunteers in their aggression policy. Our people deeply believe that the final victory will surely belong to the heroic Korean people.
    The holding of the Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Month vividly demonstrates the Mongolian people's love and infinite loyalty to the great Soviet Union and Marshal Stalin, as well as the Mongolian people's willingness to strengthen and develop friendship with the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. The splendid achievements of the Soviet Union's peaceful construction and the unprecedented peace movement led by the great Soviet Union are being publicized more and more widely. There is no doubt that the current Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Month is a great contribution to further strengthening the traditional friendship between the Soviet and Mongolian peoples.
    The Mongolian people, implementing the great behests of the unforgettable leaders Sukhe-Bator and Marshal Choibalsan, under the wise leadership of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, will fight even more stubbornly in the future to consolidate the unbreakable friendship with the fraternal Soviet people, to defend world peace, and to strive for new victories for the prosperity of our beloved motherland.
    May the unbreakable friendship between the Mongolian and Soviet peoples grow day by day!
    Long live the leader of the working people of the world, the closest friend and teacher of the Mongolian people, the great Stalin!

    蒙苏人民牢不可破的友谊
    蒙古人民共和国驻华大使馆临时代办  达尔哈热布
    今年二月二十七日，是蒙古人民共和国和苏联之间签订具有历史意义的友好互助条约和经济文化合作协定的六周年。
    蒙古人民深受苏联在为共产主义凯旋的斗争中的具有全世界历史意义的胜利所鼓舞，深受它的全面的兄弟般的帮助所鼓舞；现在他们怀着对苏联深深感谢的心情，迎接这个具有历史意义的日子——我们的在巨大的政治热潮和劳动热潮情况下的真正全体人民的节日。
    对于这一点的一个显明例证，就是蒙苏友好月的筹备和举行；这乃是在蒙古人民革命三十周年的庆祝之后蒙古人民生活中的最巨大最快乐的事件。在我国，为了蒙苏友好月而举行的革命竞赛，达到了宏大的规模。到处都是欢腾和愉快。对于我国每一个劳动者来说，再没比用新的劳动胜利来纪念这个节日更为神圣的了。
    蒙古人民很清楚地知道，只有对世界上先进的社会主义国家的友谊，才能保证我国的自由和独立，才能保证它在走向社会主义的道路上继续不断地发展和繁荣。
    我们的英明的和亲爱的领袖乔巴山元帅毕生教导我们尽力巩固对伟大的苏联人民的牢不可破的友谊；这种友谊乃是我们祖国繁荣的可靠保证。乔巴山同志是全力巩固对苏友谊的热诚战士，并将此看作蒙古人民的光明的未来。乔巴山元帅在蒙古人民革命三十周年纪念之际致苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟部长会议主席斯大林大元帅的电报里，表达了蒙古人民的意志，他写道：“蒙古人民在自己独立自主存在的三十年来，在蒙古人民革命党的领导下，在建设自己的国家和发展自己国家的经济和文化中获得了重大的成就；他们一年比一年更深刻地意识到，他们之能够获得独立、自由和幸福，首先应当感谢伟大的苏联的全面的兄弟般的帮助和支援以及您，亲爱的斯大林同志对于我国人民的经常的关注。”
    由蒙古人民的伟大领袖和导师苏赫—巴托尔和乔巴山所奠立的对苏联的传统的友谊在日趋巩固，这种友谊对于经济的、政治的、文化的生活之发展，处处都表现出它的有利的影响。
    蒙古人民在国民经济和文化的一切部门里取得了其历史上空前未有的全国规模的成就，这些成就之能够成为可能，只是由于人民民主制度在我国的胜利，由于伟大的苏联的经常和无私的帮助，以及伟大的斯大林对于我国人民的父亲般的关怀。在兄弟般的苏联人民的经常帮助下，我国经济的基本部门——牧畜业——前进了一大步，我们也建立了自己的民族的工业，并正为发展重工业奠立巩固的基础。我国劳动者的福利在逐日增长，这也引起他们的文化需求的不断提高。新的工人阶级和民族知识分子的出现和增多是我们国家的重大成就。
    苏联的无私的和宽宏的帮助，不仅表现在物质技术的帮助上，而且也表现在苏联专家的英雄事迹上；苏联专家们执行蒙古人民亲近的朋友和导师斯大林同志的指示，教我们建设新生活，将自己的丰富的知识和建设社会主义的经验传授给我们。由于他们为了我国人民、为了巩固我们两国人民的友谊所作的和所将作的一切，我们对他们表示热烈的友谊的谢意。苏联建设社会主义的经验大大地便利了和加速了我们向社会主义前进的运动。向伟大的朋友——苏联——学习的愿望以及更加紧密地巩固对苏友谊的愿望在增长不已。在这方面，有一件事实即可作为例证：仅仅在去年，我国各界就有许多个代表团为学习苏联经济建设和文化建设的经验而访问了苏联。
    这样，苏联对我国人民的全面帮助——这种帮助就是从一九二一年即建立起来的蒙苏友谊的实际表现——就是我们自己亲眼看到的经济和文化的成就的决定因素。
    对苏联的友谊，对于我们祖国的安全与独立存在有着决定性的意义。自主的蒙古国家在同苏联亲密友好下的三十年的存在，乃是列宁—斯大林对外政策的真正原则体现在生活中的鲜明例证之一，这一政策在保卫着大小民族的充分平等和自主。
    友好互助条约是蒙苏互助议定书的直接的继续，它以互相尊重真正的平等、国家主权和领土完整为自己的牢固的基础。在整个蒙古史上从未有过像蒙苏友谊这样的正义的友谊和兄弟般的互助。蒙苏友谊在蒙苏共同反对第二次世界大战底煽动者——德国与日本帝国主义者——的斗争中经过了考验并表现出了它的强大有力和生气勃勃。这一友谊，对于我国，不只一次地表现为防止日本帝国主义底侵犯的可靠保障。
    蒙古人民共和国和苏维埃联盟之间的友谊在维护远东的和平与安全的事业上具有巨大的意义。斯大林同志在蒙苏友好互助条约与经济文化合作协定签订一周年时致乔巴山元帅的电报中写道：“这些历史性的文件是对于保卫远东的和平与安全的事业的重大贡献，并是更进一步地发展我们两国之间的友好关系的坚固的基础。”
    由于同苏联的伟大的友谊，我国人民在扩展着与人民民主国家的友好关系，我国的国际地位在逐日地巩固，我国的国际威信在逐日提高。在这方面，伟大的中国人民的具有全世界历史意义的胜利和中华人民共和国的成立具有决定性的意义。
    中华人民共和国的成立及其与苏联的伟大友谊对于我国具有非常重大的意义，而且全世界爱好和平的人民在他们的争取和平的共同斗争中也倚靠着苏中友好同盟互助条约这个具有全世界历史意义的条约；它乃是对于帝国主义的致命打击。
    帝国主义的战争挑拨者，对爱好和平的朝鲜人民进行着血腥的干涉，他们在自己的侵略政策方面遭受到中国人民志愿军的不可克服的抵抗。我国人民深深相信最后胜利必属于英勇的朝鲜人民。
    蒙苏友好月的举行，鲜明地表示了蒙古人民对于伟大的苏联和斯大林大元帅的热爱和无限的忠诚，以及蒙古人民尽力加强和发展与苏联各民族友好的意愿。苏联的和平建设和以伟大的苏联为首的规模空前的拥护和平运动的辉煌成就，正被愈来愈广泛地宣传着。毫无疑问，在目前举行的蒙苏友好月乃是对于更进一步加强苏联与蒙古人民之间的传统友谊的巨大贡献。
    蒙古人民实现着永志不忘的领袖苏赫—巴托尔和乔巴山元帅的伟大遗训，在蒙古人民革命党的英明的领导之下，今后将为巩固对兄弟般的苏联人民的牢不可破的友谊、为保卫世界和平而更顽强地斗争，并为我们亲爱的祖国的繁荣争取新的胜利。
    祝蒙苏两国人民的牢不可破的友谊日益增长！
    全世界劳动人民的领袖，蒙古人民的最亲近的朋友和导师伟大的斯大林万岁！
