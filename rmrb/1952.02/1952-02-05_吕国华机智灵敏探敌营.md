　　On the evening of February 27, 1951, Lü Guohua, the platoon leader of the first platoon of a certain unit of the Volunteer Army, led a squad of soldiers to reconnoiter the enemy's defense in the mountains south of the Han River. After wading across the Han River and entering a village burning fiercely, they saw innocent Korean men and women dying in the flames. The brutality of the American aggressors further aroused their determination to complete their mission. Leaving the village, they could vaguely see the traces left by enemy tanks. Based on Lü Guohua's wisdom and experience, he immediately judged the enemy's activities during the day. He cleverly advanced in groups, rushing towards the 203 Highland next to the village. It was pitch black, and the soldiers moved quickly. Lü Guohua's group soon reached the top of the mountain. There was an enemy recoilless gun on the mountain, but the enemy soldiers guarding the gun had not yet discovered anyone coming up. Lü Guohua and the other two immediately pounced on the gun. At this moment, two tall dark figures suddenly stood up, making a gesture to fire the gun. Lü Guohua was quick-witted and swift, pushing the cannon down the mountain. Then came two shots, and the two enemies fell to the ground with the sound of the shots. Deputy platoon leader Tai Baocheng and soldier Zhang Yaocai lay on the ground, aiming their machine guns and rifles at the enemies rushing up from behind the mountain, and none of these British devils escaped their deserved punishment. This alarmed the surrounding enemy troops, who fiercely fired artillery, machine guns, flamethrowers, and flares at the 203 Highland. After Lü Guohua discerned the enemy's types of troops, weapons, and location from the enemy's firepower, he cleverly withdrew from the mountain and carried the recoilless gun back victoriously.

    吕国华机智灵敏探敌营
    一九五一年二月二十七日晚，志愿军某部第一排排长吕国华带着一班战士，到汉江南岸敌人布防的群山丛中去侦察。涉过汉江，进入一个正在燃烧着烈火的村庄，他们看见了死在火焰中的朝鲜无辜男女，美国侵略者的暴行，更加激起了他们完成任务的决心。出村，可隐约看出敌人坦克走过后留下的痕迹。凭着吕国华的智慧和经验，立刻判断出了敌人白天在这里活动的情况。他机智地分组前进，扑向村旁的二○三高地。天漆黑，战士们动作很迅速，吕国华带领的小组不一会便摸到了山顶。山上有敌人的一门无座力炮，但守炮的敌兵还未发现有人上来。吕国华等三人马上向炮身扑去。这时，两个高大的黑影猛然站起，作出发炮的姿势。吕国华眼快手捷，顺手将大炮推下山去，接着就是两枪，两个敌人便随着枪声倒在地下。副排长邰宝成、战士张耀才伏在地上，用机枪、步枪对准山后扑上来的敌人齐发，这群英国鬼子一个也没有逃脱他们应得的惩罚。这一下，惊醒了四周的敌军，他们以大炮、机枪、喷火器、照明弹对准二○三高地猛烈射击。吕国华从敌人的火力判清了敌人的兵种、武器和驻地后，便机智地撤下山来，抬着无座力炮胜利返回。（附图片）
