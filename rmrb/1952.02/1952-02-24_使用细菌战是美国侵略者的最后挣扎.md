    Using Germ Warfare is the Last Gasp of the American Aggressors
    Zhang Naichu, Professor of Bacteriology, China Union Medical College
    When I learned that the American aggressor troops were employing bacteriological warfare, I felt boundless indignation at this inhuman atrocity of American imperialism. Reflecting on how I had previously lacked confidence in victory due to a fear of American imperialism, the facts now tell us that weapons are by no means the determining factor in the outcome of a war. The determining factors are the broad masses of people who support a just war and the soldiers who wield the weapons.
    The American aggressor troops have already used all sorts of methods in an attempt to salvage their defeat: wantonly bombing peaceful residents, inhumanely abusing our captured personnel, using poison gas, and even threatening to use atomic bombs. These have not only failed to bring them victory, but have resulted in repeated defeats. However, the American aggressors are unwilling to admit defeat and are still making a last-ditch effort. Now, while holding armistice negotiations with us, they are expanding their military and resorting to bacteriological warfare. This shows that the American aggressors have no sincerity in peacefully resolving the Korean issue.
    We are not afraid of the American aggressors' germ warfare, because although bacteria can spread disease, they can be prevented and eliminated, just as we can eliminate the American aggressor troops. We have the confidence to eliminate the bacteria sown by the American aggressors. However, we can also see from this that the bestiality of American imperialism is no different from that of the Japanese and German fascists.
    We must further recognize that the reason the American aggressor troops are employing germ warfare is because they are attempting to make a final desperate struggle. When their military setbacks become impossible to reverse and atomic bombs lose their power of threat, they can only resort to germ warfare, hoping to psychologically threaten us. Therefore, in addition to heightening our vigilance, we must remain calm and recognize their trick. Recalling when the Soviet Union tried Japanese germ warfare criminals, American imperialism not only refrained from expressing any opinion but also shielded the Japanese germ warfare criminals, indicating that they had long planned for germ warfare.
    This fact clearly points out that science and politics cannot be separated. The purpose of bacteriological research is originally to promote human health, but when it is in the hands of imperialism, it is used as a weapon to kill people on a large scale.
    We, the people who fight for justice and peace, must organize ourselves and support our beloved Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army. We bacteriological workers should be ready to respond to the call of the motherland at any time, strive to go to the front lines in Korea, and wholeheartedly fight to eliminate our enemies.

    使用细菌战是美国侵略者的最后挣扎
    中国协和医学院细菌学系教授  张乃初
    当我知道美国侵略军采用细菌作战后，对美帝国主义这种灭绝人性的暴行，发生了无限的愤恨。回想自己已往曾经因为对美帝国主义有惧怕心理，以致没有胜利信心；然而，事实告诉我们：武器绝不是决定战争胜负的因素。决定战争胜败的因素却是支持正义战争的广大人民和使用武器的军士。
    美国侵略军已经使用过各种各样方法来企图挽救他们的失败：用飞机狂炸和平居民，毫无人性地虐待我方被俘人员，使用毒气，甚至还威吓着要使用原子弹。这些，不但没有使他获得胜利，反而遭到节节失败。但是，美国侵略者不甘心失败，还在作最后挣扎。现在，他们一面在和我们举行停战谈判，一面在扩军，并且又采用细菌战术，可见美国侵略者没有和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。
    我们并不害怕美国侵略者的细菌战争，因为细菌虽然能够散布疾病，但是它是能够预防和消灭的，就好像我们能够消灭美国侵略军一样。我们有消灭美国侵略者所撒下的细菌的信心。但是，我们也可以由此看出：美帝国主义的兽性，和日、德法西斯并无二致。
    我们更要认识：美国侵略军所以采用细菌战的原因，就是因为他们企图作最后挣扎。当他们军事方面的败势已经无法挽回，而原子弹又丧失威胁力量的时候，只好采用细菌战，想从心理上来威胁我们，所以我们除了提高警惕外，还要镇静，认清他这鬼计。回想当苏联审判日本细菌战犯时，美帝国主义不独不发表意见，而且庇护日本细菌战犯，可见他们对细菌战是早已作了计划的。
    这一事实，清楚地指出了科学和政治是不能分离的。细菌学研究的目的本是为了谋人类的健康，而它操在帝国主义手里时，却被利用作为大批地杀人的凶器。
    我们为正义及和平而战斗的人民，一定要组织起来，支援我们亲爱的志愿军和朝鲜人民军。我们细菌学工作者，应该随时准备响应祖国号召，争取到朝鲜前线去，全心全力为消灭我们的敌人而斗争。
