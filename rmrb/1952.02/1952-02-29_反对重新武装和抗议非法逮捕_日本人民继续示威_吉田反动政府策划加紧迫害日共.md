    Oppose Rearmament and Protest Illegal Arrests
    Japanese People Continue to Demonstrate
    Yoshida Reactionary Government Plots to Intensify Persecution of the Japanese Communist Party
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 28th] Demonstrations continue across Japan, opposing rearmament and protesting persecution measures. According to TASS, in Kyoto, over a thousand workers and students demonstrated against the rearmament of Japan. Police attacked the demonstrators, injuring several people. Protest demonstrations were also held in Tokyo and Aomori, opposing the arrest and police persecution of those participating in the democratic movement. On the 23rd, university students in Nagoya held a protest strike.
    Police arrest outrages continue incessantly. On the 25th, police in Tokyo arrested two more workers who had participated in the February 21st "Day of Struggle Against Colonial System" demonstration. Police also arrested many students who had collected signatures for a petition opposing rearmament.
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 28th] The Yoshida reactionary government is plotting to intensify the suppression of the Japanese Communist Party and patriots. According to a TASS Tokyo dispatch on the 27th: The "Tokyo Shimbun" revealed that the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office has decided to order the police to use weapons to suppress "Communist agitators." According to the "Mainichi Shimbun," Justice Minister Kimura said at a meeting of the Liberal Party's General Affairs Committee: "Matches or foreign cigarettes in the hands of communists are weapons." Even the conservative "Mainichi Shimbun" ironically commented on this: "For a government that insists torpedo boats and rocket launchers are not war potential, matches or foreign cigarettes have become even more terrifying weapons." According to Kyodo News, the Liberal Party's General Affairs Committee decided to request the government to take "more severe measures to maintain public order." Within the Liberal Party group, talk about the "necessity" of declaring the Communist Party illegal is becoming increasingly common. Even some bourgeois newspapers are criticizing the government's policy of police repression. The "Tokyo Times" called this policy a foolish one. It said that the events of February 21st (the day when people all over Japan held demonstrations to commemorate the "Day of Struggle Against Colonial System") can be seen as the people protesting against the government's stubborn and meaningless policy of rearmament.

    反对重新武装和抗议非法逮捕
    日本人民继续示威
    吉田反动政府策划加紧迫害日共
    【新华社二十八日讯】日本各地人民继续举行示威，反对重新武装和抗议迫害措施。据塔斯社讯，在京都，一千多名工人和学生举行示威，反对重新武装日本。警察袭击示威者，打伤了几个人。东京和青森等地也举行了抗议示威，反对对参加民主运动的人实行逮捕和警察的迫害。二十三日，名古屋的大学学生们举行了抗议罢课。
    警察的逮捕暴行，层出不穷。二十五日，警察又在东京逮捕了两名曾参加过二十一日“反对殖民制度斗争日”的示威游行的工人。警察还逮捕了许多曾为反对重新武装的抗议书征集签名的学生。
    【新华社二十八日讯】吉田反动政府正在策划加紧镇压日本共产党和爱国者。据塔斯社东京二十七日消息：“东京新闻”透露，最高检察厅已决定命令警察使用武器来镇压“共产党骚动者”。据“每日新闻”说，法务府总裁木村在自由党总务委员会会议上说：“在共产党人手中的火柴或外国纸烟都是武器。”甚至保守的“每日新闻”都就这一点讥讽地说道：“对于硬说鱼雷艇和火箭炮不是战争潜力的政府来说，火柴或外国纸烟倒成为更为可怕的武器了。”据共同社消息，自由党总务委员会曾决定要求政府采取“更为严厉的措施，维持治安”。在自由党集团中间，越来越常听到关于有“必要”宣布共产党为非法的言论了。甚至某些资产阶级报纸也批评政府所执行的警察压迫的政策。“东京时报”把这种政策称为愚蠢的政策。它说，二月二十一日的事件（那天日本各地人民纷纷举行示威游行以纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”），可以被看作是人民抗议政府所执行的固执而无意义的重新武装的政策。
