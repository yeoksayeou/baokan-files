    Sniper on an Outpost
    By Xinhua Correspondent Wang Yuzhang

    This is an outpost on the front lines of the Imjin River, nestled on a low ridge. Our snipers hold the northern half of the mountain, while the southern half is the enemy's position. Our sentries and the enemy's sentries are no more than a hundred meters apart. Fighting occurs here every day, with shell craters dotting the ridge, one after another. During the day, the enemy shoots and shells to the north, and at night they often blindly strafe with machine guns.

    On this small outpost, the volunteer snipers have built solid and concealed fortifications, guarding day and night, monitoring and attacking the enemy. At the mouth of the trenches, behind snowdrifts, and next to large trees, keen eyes like those of hawks are hidden everywhere, fixed on the enemy. Any enemy who comes out to erect barbed wire, lay mines, or strolls around the position peering through binoculars, might be suddenly struck by a flying bullet and meet their demise. In one month and four days, the snipers have killed ninety-six enemies without suffering a single casualty themselves.

    In the midst of the fierce fighting between our positions and the enemy’s, a small thatched hut remains. This small hut is closer to the enemy, and they often dart in and out of it. One day, three enemies even set fire to the house. Our soldiers have long hated the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea, their murder and arson. How could they allow these bandits to commit such acts before their very eyes! Cao Zhencai, the squad leader in charge of these sniper teams, shouted angrily, "Shoot!" With a "crack," one was shot down. Another enemy reached out to pull the fallen one, but was also shot down to the ground by a bullet. The remaining one was so scared that he fled back to the bunker without looking back.

    The enemy is constantly unnerved and terrified by the daily attacks. They brought in artillery to bombard our positions, and when that failed, they sent two planes to bomb our positions. The planes came fiercely, filling the mountains with smoke. The enemy, who usually dared not show their faces because of the snipers, took the opportunity to crawl out of their bunkers and stand on the hilltop, clapping and laughing. At that moment, a burst of dense gunfire suddenly rang out. Machine gun and rifle bullets flew like a storm, severely punishing the complacent enemy once again. This time, the enemy's bombing not only failed to injure any of our men, but they also needlessly sacrificed a dozen of their own lives.

    Seeing that planes and artillery were useless, the enemy resorted to night raids. The first two small night raids were repelled. Unwilling to give up, the enemy launched another surprise attack one night with a platoon of soldiers. The snipers were well prepared. They placed piles of open-lidded grenades in the trenches. As the enemy approached the position, the snipers threw the grenades out like a string of beads, and the machine guns opened fire, causing the enemy to lose their bearings and scatter in all directions, suffering many casualties. After the battle, the snipers laughed and said, "They tried to steal a chicken, but lost the bait instead!"

    On the earthen wall of the dugout was pasted a "Great Production" brand cigarette box wrapper, the only beautiful decoration on this small position. During lulls in the fighting, the brave snipers often stood before this small picture, gazing at the blue sky, the red sorghum ears, the factory with smoke rising from its chimney, and the healthy and happy workers and farmers standing there. Facing this miniature of their motherland's prosperity and strength, which they were personally defending, they felt immensely comforted. Sometimes, the cooks who brought them food brought news of the motherland's construction and letters of support from their comrades. They happily read them aloud, laughing and talking. Then they also wrote letters, entrusting the cooks to take them back to the company headquarters, reporting their achievements of the day to the company commander and their comrades. They often wrote in their letters: "Tomorrow, we will certainly kill and wound more enemies!"

### 前哨阵地上的狙击手

    前哨阵地上的狙击手
    新华社记者  王玉章
    这儿是临津江前线的一个前哨阵地，它盘在一座不高的山岭上。我们的狙击手们据守着山的北半段，南半段就是敌人的阵地；我们的哨兵和敌人的哨兵相距不过一百公尺。这儿每天都发生战斗，山脊上的炮弹坑一个挨着一个。白天敌人向北面打枪打炮，夜间也时常用机枪盲目扫射。
    在这个小小的前哨阵地上，志愿军的狙击手们修筑了坚固而隐蔽的工事，日日夜夜守卫在这里，监视着敌人，打击着敌人。在交通沟口上，在白雪堆的后面，在大树旁边，到处隐藏着几只鹰一般锐利的眼睛，盯住敌人。凡是出来架铁丝网的、埋地雷的、或是在阵地上逛来逛去拿着望远镜窥探的敌人，说不定在什么时候就会被突然飞去的一颗子弹击中而一命呜呼。在一个月零四天当中，狙击手们已经打死了九十六个敌人，而自己却无一伤亡。
    在战火纷飞的敌我阵地之间，残留着一座小草屋。这座小草屋靠敌人近些，敌人经常在小草屋里闯进闯出。有一天三个敌人竟放火烧这座房子，战士们早就恨透了美国侵略军在朝鲜杀人放火的暴行，他们那能容许这些强盗在眼前放火行凶呢！带领这几个狙击组的班长曹振才愤怒地喊了一声：“打！”“叭”的一声就打倒了一个，另一个敌人伸手去拉那个倒下的家伙，又被一颗子弹打倒在地上，剩下的一个家伙吓得头也不回地逃回地堡去了。
    敌人天天被打得心魂不定胆战心惊。他们调来大炮轰击我军阵地，失败了又调来两架飞机向我军阵地进行轰炸。那飞机来势凶凶，打得满山烟雾腾腾。在平日被狙击手们打得很久不敢抬头露面的敌人，也趁这机会从地堡里钻出来，站在山头上拍掌大笑。就在这个时候，突然响起了密集的枪声，机枪和步枪的子弹像狂风般地射去，把得意忘形的敌人又狠狠地教训了一顿。这次敌人的轰炸，不但没打伤我们一个人，他们自己却白白地断送了十几个人的性命。
    敌人看见飞机大炮都不中用，又用夜袭的诡计。头两次小的夜袭被打退了，敌人不肯罢休，又在一个晚上用一个排的兵力来偷袭。狙击手们早有了充分准备，他们在交通沟里放着一堆堆揭开了盖子的手榴弹。敌人快接近阵地了，狙击手们把手榴弹联珠似地摔了出去，机枪也响了起来，打得敌人蒙头转向，四处乱窜，死伤很多。战后，狙击手们大笑着说：“这是‘偷鸡不着蚀把米’！”
    在掩蔽部里的土墙上贴了一张大生产牌纸烟的盒纸，这是这小小阵地上唯一的美丽的点缀品。神勇的狙击手们常常在战斗间隙时站在这幅小小的画面前，凝视着盒片上蓝蓝的天空、红红的高粱穗子、烟囱里正在冒烟的工厂和站立在那里的健康而幸福的工人和农民。他们面对着这幅为自己亲身保卫着的祖国繁荣富强的缩影，感到极大的安慰。有时送饭来的炊事员给他们带来了祖国建设的消息，和战友们写给他们的慰问信，他们快活地朗诵着说笑着了，然后他们也写信托炊事员带回连部去，向连长和战友们报告他们当天的战绩。他们在信上常常这样写着：明天一定要杀伤更多的敌人！
