Xinhua News Agency, February 12th: A report from Kaesong on the 10th by Alan Winnington, a reporter for the London "Daily Worker," states: The U.S. side has so far shown no intention of achieving a peaceful and comprehensive resolution of the Korean issue. Their proposal, on the surface, looks very similar to the Korean-Chinese side's proposal, but in fact, the wording is very cunning. General Nam Il told them that their proposal would allow them to prolong the political conference on the governments concerned for a long time. The U.S. side avoided talking about holding a meeting within three months, only vaguely saying that "steps would be taken" within three months—in a meeting or through "other appropriate political methods"—to deal with the outstanding issues. They superficially agreed to the withdrawal of non-Korean troops and a peaceful settlement, but this superficial agreement was completely negated by their proposal to arbitrarily and indefinitely delay the meeting. They insisted on discussing only purely Korean issues, which made a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue impossible. It is obvious that the U.S. militarists are solely focused on maintaining and consolidating their bases on the Asian continent, maintaining world tension, keeping both sides' fully armed forces in an uneasy balance, confronting each other across a four-kilometer-wide no-man's land, which they can break when they deem breaking the balance suits their purposes. For the same reason, they insisted on rotating 40,000 people per month and supervising the wide ports in the eight surrounding areas of North Korea, but they refused to specify how long the supervision period would last.

    伦敦工人日报记者揭露
    美方仍然想保持紧张局势
    无意让朝鲜问题和平解决
    【新华社十二日讯】伦敦“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿十日自开城报道：美方迄今为止仍表现无意让朝鲜问题得到和平的全面的解决。他们的方案从表面上看起来和朝中方面的方案很相似，其实措词非常狡猾。南日将军对他们说：他们的方案使他们可以长期拖延有关政府的政治会议。美方避而不谈在三个月内举行会议的事，只是含糊其词地说：在三个月内“采取步骤”——在一个会议上或者用“其他适当的政治方法”——处理悬而未决的问题。他们表面上同意非朝鲜军队撤退与和平解决，但是这种表面上的同意却被他们所提的任意无限期地拖延会议的建议完全抵消了。他们主张只讨论纯粹朝鲜问题，这样就使朝鲜问题的和平解决没有可能实现。显而易见，美国军国主义者一心只想保有和巩固亚洲大陆上的基地，保持世界紧张局势，使双方全副武装的军队处于不安的平衡状态，隔着四公里阔的无人地带相对峙，而当他们认为破坏这种平衡状态适合于他们的目的时，他们就可以加以破坏。由于同样原因，他们坚持每月轮换四万人，并在朝鲜北部的八个周围地区的宽广的口岸进行监督，至于监督的期限有多长，他们却不肯规定。
