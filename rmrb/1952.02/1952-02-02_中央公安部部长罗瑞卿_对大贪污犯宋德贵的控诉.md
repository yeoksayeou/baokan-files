    Minister of Public Security Luo Ruiqing's
    Accusation Against Major Embezzler Song Degui

    Song Degui was the original Administrative Section Chief of the Ministry of Public Security and also the major embezzler exposed in the current movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. He colluded with unscrupulous merchants Zhao Xiqiao of Tianjin Donghua Freight Station, Yang Shengxiang of Beijing Xiangli Wood Factory, and others to steal large amounts of state property, totaling over 900 million yuan. Song Degui personally embezzled 640 million yuan from this.

    The methods employed by Song Degui and the unscrupulous merchants Zhao Xiqiao, Yang Shengxiang, etc., to collude and steal state property were meticulously planned and carefully arranged. They cleverly exploited the opportunity of the Ministry of Public Security's timber procurement in the Northeast last April, using the pretext of "paying handling fees." The first time, they paid Zhao Xiqiao 700 million yuan, and the second time, they paid another 500 million yuan. The handling fees should have been a maximum of 500 million yuan, but under the guise of these so-called "handling fees," he paid 1.2 billion yuan, meaning that he overpaid the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Xiqiao and others by 700 million yuan in total for the two transactions. The third time, under the pretext of entrusting someone to store timber, he overpaid the unscrupulous merchant of Beijing Xiangli Wood Factory by 200 million yuan.

    After Song Degui achieved his sinister goal of stealing a large amount of state property, he completely joined the gang of unscrupulous merchants Zhao Xiqiao and Yang Shengxiang, actually becoming one of the major bosses of Donghua Freight Station and Xiangli Wood Factory, turning Donghua and Xiangli into the joint property of him and the unscrupulous merchants Zhao Xiqiao and Yang Shengxiang. They thought that this cunning scheme would not be discovered, and they were momentarily carried away with joy. Song Degui regarded the unscrupulous merchants as his "good strategists," obeying their every word. The unscrupulous merchant Zhao Xiqiao also said to others, "As long as we rely on Section Chief Song, we will have a lifetime of enjoyment." However, the tricks of the embezzlers and unscrupulous merchants were finally exposed and torn apart, and we finally caught these despicable robbers.

    Song Degui's crimes do not stop there. In order to steal more state property, he and the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Xiqiao arrogantly used the name of the Ministry of Public Security to enter the market, swindling and deceiving. He also stole the official seal of the Ministry of Public Security, intending to introduce the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Xiqiao to Guangzhou to engage in foreign exchange business and to transport steel from Anshan in the Northeast. If not for the exposure and revelation of the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, we do not know how much more loss our country's wealth would have suffered!

    After Song Degui fell deeply into the quagmire of embezzlement and being seduced by unscrupulous merchants, his life became corrupt and degenerate to an unimaginable extent. In the half-year period from April to October 1951 alone, he squandered as much as 300 million yuan on banquets, watching plays, playing with female waitresses, buying clothes, eating ginseng, deer antler, seadragon, seahorse, etc., with unscrupulous merchants and other embezzlers. The publicly reimbursed expenses for hotels, meals, miscellaneous expenses, etc., exceeding 100 million yuan, are not even included. They stayed in the most luxurious hotels in the Northeast, and in Beijing, they ate at the best restaurants and the best banquets. It is reported that Song Degui drank one or two bottles of high-quality brandy every day, and many famous restaurants in Beijing knew "Section Chief Song" of the Ministry of Public Security. At the end of the procurement work, which was also when Song Degui and others achieved their sinister goal of stealing a large amount of state wealth, they held a so-called "victory celebration" banquet, inviting a group of unscrupulous merchants and embezzlers, setting up six tables of banquets, each costing as much as 800,000 yuan. Comrades, can we still tolerate such criminals like Song Degui who steal and destroy large amounts of state wealth? Can we not hate them extremely?

    Song Degui's crimes do not stop there. In order to cover up his own guilt, he completely followed the methods of the bourgeoisie to drag others down, using the state wealth he had stolen to buy large quantities of watches, pens, radios, bicycles, ginseng, deer antler, seadragon, sea dog kidney, cigarettes, wine, etc., and cash to give away everywhere, dragging some weak-willed individuals into the water to commit embezzlement with him. Therefore, you can see that Song Degui has completely become an outpost for the bourgeoisie to attack us, a loyal lackey for the bourgeoisie to corrupt the revolutionary ranks.

    Song Degui's crimes do not stop there. After his embezzlement was discovered, he not only did not confess his guilt but also tried every means to deny it. Last November, after we noticed his embezzlement, we repeatedly mobilized him to confess and hand over the accounts, but he used the excuse that there were accounts but no mistakes, and then began to fabricate false accounts. He fabricated for more than twenty days and still could not produce the accounts. After the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, we again educated him very seriously and repeatedly, mobilizing him to confess his guilt, but he not only did not repent but instead intensified his activities to sabotage the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. In late December, he secretly met with the unscrupulous merchant Zhao Xiqiao and other embezzlers in Beijing twice to discuss countermeasures. He instructed Donghua Freight Station to quickly book the 700 million yuan in tax evasion, report the tax to the tax bureau, and quickly prepare the receipts and send them to the Ministry of Public Security in order to deal with the inspection of accounts. He also instructed, "When the Ministry of Public Security goes to Tianjin to check the accounts, only talk about wasteful living, and don't talk about anything else." Even after he was arrested, during the interrogation process, he still argued in various ways, downplaying the seriousness of the situation, and refusing to confess. Only when the evidence was irrefutable did he finally bow his head and confess. But he still withholds part of his crimes, as well as the crimes of other embezzlers he knows, and refuses to fully confess.

    Comrades, I believe that the above facts are fully sufficient to prove that Song Degui is an extremely heinous embezzler. Although he was once a revolutionary cadre and joined the Communist Party of China, he has completely degenerated to an irreparable extent. His harm to the interests of the state and the people has reached an extremely serious degree. Therefore, we have every reason to demand that the Provisional Court of the Supreme People's Court give Song Degui the most severe punishment! I think we must do this, otherwise, it would be tantamount to encouraging embezzlers to continue to steal our country's property, to encouraging the bourgeoisie to continue its frantic attacks on the people and the People's Government, and to encouraging those major embezzlers who have not yet confessed to continue to conceal their crimes. Comrades, we must never do this, because doing so will not only result in our country's property continuing to be embezzled in large quantities, but the Chinese revolution may also face the danger of failure. Therefore, I earnestly request the Provisional Court of the Supreme People's Court to sentence Song Degui to death and execute him immediately. I earnestly request all comrades present to approve of my opinion.

    中央公安部部长罗瑞卿  
    对大贪污犯宋德贵的控诉
    宋德贵是中央公安部原来的行政处长，也是此次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中被检举出来的大贪污犯。他与奸商天津东华货栈赵溪桥、北京祥利木厂杨生祥等勾结起来，共同盗窃大量国家财产，先后共达九亿余元。宋德贵个人从中贪污六亿四千万元。
    宋德贵和奸商赵溪桥、杨生祥等相互勾结盗窃国家财产所采用的办法，是经过精心计划和周密布置的。他们很巧妙地利用了中央公安部去年四月在东北采购木材的机会，用“给手续费”的名义，第一次付给了赵溪桥七亿元，第二次又付给了五亿元。本来最多只能付给手续费五亿元，而他却在这种所谓“手续费”名义的掩盖之下，付给了十二亿元，就是说两次一共多付给奸商赵溪桥等七亿元。第三次又以托人保管木材的名义，多付给北京祥利木厂的奸商两亿元。
    宋德贵达到了盗窃国家大量财产的罪恶目的之后，就完完全全地加入了奸商赵溪桥、杨生祥一伙，实际上成了东华货栈和祥利木厂的大老板之一，把东华、祥利变成他和奸商赵溪桥、杨生祥的共同财产。他们以为这种奸诈的阴谋，是不会被发觉的，因而他们曾一时得意忘形；宋德贵把奸商们看作他的“好军师”，言听计从。奸商赵溪桥亦曾对人说：“我们只要依靠住宋处长，一辈子的享受都有了。”但是，贪污分子和奸商们的诡计终于被揭穿被撕破了，我们终于捉住了这些可恶的强盗。
    宋德贵的罪恶还不只此。为了更多地盗窃国家财产，他与奸商赵溪桥曾狂妄地假借中央公安部的名义，出入市场，招摇撞骗。并曾盗取中央公安部的公章，打算介绍奸商赵溪桥前往广州搞外汇生意，和到东北鞍山盗运钢铁。不是反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的检举和揭发，我们国家的财富还不知要遭受多大的损失！
    宋犯德贵深深地陷入贪污和奸商勾引的泥坑之后，他的生活就腐化堕落到难以想像的程度。一九五一年的四月至十月的半年时间内，他与奸商及其他贪污分子仅吃酒席、看戏、玩女招待、买衣服、吃人参、鹿茸、海龙、海马等，共挥霍了三亿元之多。公开报销的住旅馆、吃饭、杂支等一亿元以上的费用，还未计算在内。他们在东北住最阔气的旅馆，在北京吃遍了最好的饭馆和最好的酒席。据查宋德贵每天要喝一两瓶上等的白兰地，北京许多有名的饭馆都知道公安部的“宋处长”。在采购工作结束时，也是宋德贵等达到了大量盗窃国家财富的罪恶目的时，他们举行了一次所谓“庆祝胜利”的大宴会，邀集了一批奸商和贪污分子，摆了六桌酒席，每桌竟达八十万元之巨。同志们，像宋德贵这样大量盗窃、大量破坏国家财富的罪犯，难道我们还能容忍他们吗？还能不极端痛恨他们吗？
    宋德贵的罪恶还不只此。为了掩盖他自己的罪责，他完全按照资产阶级拖他下水的办法，用来拖别人下水。他曾以盗取得来的国家财富，大批地购买手表、钢笔、收音机、自行车、人参、鹿茸、海龙、海狗肾、香烟、酒等，以及现金到处送人，把
    一些意志薄弱的分子拖下水去，与他共同进行贪污。因此你们可以看到：宋德贵已经完完全全地变成了资产阶级向我们进攻的前哨部队，变成了资产阶级腐蚀革命队伍的忠实奴才了。
    宋德贵的罪恶还不只此。他的贪污罪行被发觉后，不仅不坦白认罪，而且百般抵赖。去年十一月我们察觉了他的贪污行为后，即再三动员他坦白，交清账目，但他一面以有账无错相搪塞，一面即开始造假账的活动。他捏造了二十余天始终交不出账来。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始以后，我们又十分严肃地、反复地向他进行教育，动员他坦白认罪，但他不仅不幡然悔悟，反而更加紧了破坏反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的活动。十二月下旬，他曾经同奸商赵溪桥及其他贪污分子在北京两次秘密开会，商讨对付办法。他指示东华货栈把漏税之七亿元迅速登账，向税局报税，并迅将单据造好送中央公安部，以便对付检查账目。并指示“当中央公安部至天津查账时，只说生活有浪费，其他一概不谈”。就在他被逮捕起来以后，在审讯过程中，仍多方狡辩，避重就轻，拒不坦白，只在罪证确凿无可抵赖的情况下，最后才低头认罪。但对于他还有的一部分罪行，以及他所知道的其他贪污分子的罪行，直到现在还保留起来，不肯完全地坦白供认。
    同志们，我以为上述事实，已经完全足以说明宋德贵是一个罪大恶极的贪污分子，他虽然曾经是一个革命干部，也曾加入过中国共产党，但他已经完全堕落到无可救药的地步，他对于国家和人民利益的危害，已经到了极其严重的程度。因此我们完全有理由要求我们的最高人民法院临时法庭，给宋德贵以最严厉的制裁！我想，我们必须如此，否则就是等于鼓励贪污分子继续盗窃我们国家的财产，等于鼓励资产阶级继续向人民和人民政府的疯狂进攻，等于鼓励那些至今尚不坦白认罪的大贪污犯继续隐瞒自己的罪行。同志们，我们绝对不能这样做，因为这样做，不仅我们国家的财产会继续被大量的贪污掉，而且中国革命都可能有遭受失败的危险。所以我恳切地要求最高人民法院临时法庭判处宋德贵以死刑并立即执行。我恳切要求所有到会的同志们赞成我的意见。
