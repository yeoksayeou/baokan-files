    CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Holds Agricultural Production Meeting
    Guarantee This Year's Grain Output Will Exceed the Highest Pre-War Level
    In order to promote the patriotic production increase movement of 1952, the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau convened an agricultural production meeting in Beijing in mid-January. The meeting required the entire North China region to complete the agricultural production tasks of increasing grain production by 7.8 billion jin and cotton by 1.73 million dan this year, so that the total grain output in the North China region would exceed the highest annual output before the War of Resistance Against Japan; and vigorously develop animal husbandry, forestry, aquaculture, and mountain dried and fresh goods production.
    The meeting considered that the winter production and preparations for large-scale production in North China were better than the previous year. The winter fallow land in various provinces had basically been cultivated once, with the least cultivated at 80 percent, and the most at over 95 percent. In general, rural winter sideline production and handicraft production had achievements, and farmers' sideline income increased significantly. This will play a considerable role in farmers purchasing draught animals and farm tools, and expanding this year's agricultural production. However, the agricultural leadership organs in some regions were busy with meetings and summarizing work after the start of winter last year, lacking in-depth and specific organizational leadership for the preparations for large-scale production, especially lacking inspection; in some regions, the upper-level leadership organs did the work, but the lower-level leadership organs did not, and in some regions, neither the upper nor lower levels did. This is not adapted to the upcoming 1952 bumper harvest movement and must be quickly corrected. At the meeting, Li Jingyu, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau of the North China Administrative Committee, pointed out: This year's bumper harvest movement is to lay a good foundation for the upcoming large-scale economic construction. Every comrade should excitedly strive to complete this year's production tasks and welcome large-scale economic construction. To develop production, we must first develop farmers' mutual aid and cooperation organizations. This is a fundamental issue that must be given great importance and done well first. Li Zheren, Deputy Director of the Financial and Economic Work Committee of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, also pointed out: This year, the North China region must expand last year's bumper harvest movement into a larger-scale mass bumper harvest movement, and must widely spread last year's bumper harvest experience, creating an intense atmosphere in the countryside where everyone is determined to achieve a bumper harvest and every household is prepared for a bumper harvest. The meeting required North China to further develop farmers' mutual aid and cooperation organizations. This year, the entire North China region will strive to organize 70 to 80 percent of the total number of farm households, with long-term fixed mutual aid teams accounting for 40 to 50 percent of all mutual aid organizations, and will steadily and actively develop agricultural production cooperatives. The meeting considered that all regions should set up dedicated personnel and certain institutions to regularly study and guide the mutual aid movement. Organizing is a matter of the direction of rural economic development. All levels of leadership organs must resolutely correct the tendency to relax leadership over the mutual aid movement and allow it to develop freely. In addition, the meeting also discussed the general establishment of state-owned farms.
    In his concluding remarks at the meeting, Li Zheren pointed out: This year's bumper harvest movement in the North China region should focus on increasing grain production; it should be guaranteed that the planting area of cotton and other cash crops is not expanded, and the increase in the production of cotton and other cash crops should only be achieved by increasing the yield per unit area. Li Zheren said: This is the need of the whole country, and all regions should firmly grasp this affirmed policy. Therefore, if we want to complete this year's production increase task, we must have the spirit of boldly developing production, and we must fully tap the potential of agricultural production in the North China region. Some cadres and farmers are satisfied with reaching the pre-War of Resistance production level, and believe that the increase in production has reached its peak. This complacent mood and conservative thinking are wrong. We should make them understand that the pre-War of Resistance production level was a very low level, the level when farmers were trapped in poverty and bankruptcy, and we could not bear it and rose up in revolution, and it must not be satisfied. The current production and life are not "good to the top," but "far from good." The leadership organs in all regions should seriously tap the potential of agricultural production. Building farmland water conservancy, improving farming methods, using new farm tools, increasing fertilizer application and improving fertilization methods, etc., can further tap the potential of agricultural production. But more important is to tap the wisdom of farmers and promote the bumper harvest experience of farmers. By gathering the experience of farmers, scientifically analyzing it, improving it, and then promoting it to the vast number of farmers, we will be able to achieve this year's production increase task.
    Li Zheren also said: Now is the eve of the large-scale production movement. Seizing time is the first hurdle for us to achieve victory on the agricultural front in 1952. All regions should immediately combine the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movements and conduct a self-examination from top to bottom of the preparatory work for the bumper harvest movement.

### 中共中央华北局召开农业生产会议  保证今年产粮超过抗战前最高年产量

    中共中央华北局召开农业生产会议  
    保证今年产粮超过抗战前最高年产量
    为了推进一九五二年的爱国丰产运动，一月中旬中共中央华北局财经工作委员会在北京召开了农业生产会议。会议要求华北全区今年完成增产粮食七十八亿斤和棉花一百七十三万担的农业生产任务，使华北区的粮食总产量超过抗日战争以前的最高年产量；并大力发展畜牧、林业、水产和山干鲜货等生产。
    会议认为：华北各地去年冬季生产和大生产的准备工作作得比前年好。各省的冬闲地基本上都耕过一遍，最少的耕了百分之八十，多的耕了百分之九十五以上。一般地区农村的冬季副业生产和手工业生产都有成绩，农民的副业收入增加很多。这对于农民购买耕畜、农具，扩大今年的农业生产能起不小的作用。但是，有些地区的农业领导机关在去年入冬后忙于开会和总结工作，对大生产准备工作缺乏深入具体的组织领导，特别缺乏检查；有些地区上层领导机关作了工作下层领导机关没有作，有些地区上下都没有作。这是和一九五二年即将开展的丰产运动不能适应的，必须迅速加以纠正。会上，华北行政委员会农林局副局长李菁玉指出：今年的丰产运动是为行将到来的大规模的经济建设打下良好的基础，每个同志应该兴奋地努力完成今年的生产任务，迎接大规模的经济建设。要发展生产首先必须发展农民的互助合作组织，这是一个根本问题，各地必须十分重视，必须首先作好。中共中央华北局财经工作委员会副主任李哲人也指出：华北区今年要把去年的丰产运动扩大为更大规模的群众性的丰产运动，就必须广泛传播去年的丰产经验，造成农村中人人有丰产决心，家家有丰产准备的紧张空气。会议要求华北各地进一步发展农民的互助合作组织。今年，华北全区将争取组织起来了的农户达到农户总数的百分之七十到百分之八十，长期固定的互助组占所有互助组织的百分之四十到五十，并将稳步而积极地发展农业生产合作社。会议认为：各地应设置专人和一定的机构，来经常研究和指导互助运动。组织起来是发展农村经济的方向问题，各级领导机关都必须坚决纠正对互助运动放松领导，任其自流的偏向。此外，会议并曾讨论普遍建立国营农场的问题。
    李哲人在会议的总结发言中指出：今年华北区的丰产运动以增产粮食为主；应保证不扩大棉花和其他经济作物的种植面积，只应以提高单位面积产量来完成棉花和其他经济作物的增产任务。李哲人说：这是全国的需要，各地应紧紧地掌握这个肯定了的方针。因此，我们要完成今年的增产任务，就要有放手发展生产的精神，就要充分发挥华北区的农业生产的潜在能力。某些干部和农民以达到了抗战前的生产水平为满足，认为增产已经到顶了，这种自满情绪和保守思想是错误的。我们应使他们了解：抗战前的生产水平是很低的水平，是农民陷于贫困和破产、我们无法忍受起而革命的时候的水平，绝不能满足。现在的生产和生活都不是“好到顶”，而是“差的远”。各地领导机关应认真地发挥农业的生产潜力。兴修农田水利，改进耕作方法，使用新式农具，增施肥料和改良施肥方法等等，都能进一步发挥农业的生产潜力。但是，更重要的是发挥农民的智慧，推广农民的丰产经验。把农民的经验集中起来，加以科学分析，使之提高后，再推广到广大农民中去，我们就能够实现今年的增产任务。
    李哲人又说：现在正是开展大生产运动的前夜，争取时间是一九五二年我们在农业战线上取得胜利的第一关。各地应即结合反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，自上而下地检查一次对丰产运动的准备工作。  （新华社）
