    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 26th: At the Korean Armistice Talks' Third Agenda Item staff meeting on the 26th, our side solemnly pointed out that unless the other side intends to delay the armistice negotiations, the other side has no reason to continue to oppose our side's reasonable compromise proposal on the rotation and port issues, and even less reason to oppose our side's neutral nation nominations that fully comply with the definition of neutral nations. The other side's suggestion at the meeting on the 25th that each side nominate two neutral nations to replace the number of three neutral nations nominated by each side, and the fact that the other side only nominated Switzerland and Sweden, while demanding that our side only nominate Poland and Czechoslovakia, is simply a means of unreasonably opposing our side's nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral nation. Any unreasonable opposition to our side's nominations that fully comply with the definition of neutral nations is absolutely unacceptable to our side, and we resolutely reject it.
    At the Fourth Agenda Item staff meeting, the other side still insisted on avoiding discussion of the principle issue of both sides releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war they hold after the armistice. The two sides only continued to exchange views on the wording of various clauses that had already been substantially agreed upon.

    朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上
    我断然拒绝美方对中立国问题的无理建议
    【新华社开城二十六日电】二十六日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议上，我方严正指出：除非对方有意拖延停战谈判，对方没有任何理由继续反对我方在轮换与口岸问题上所提出的合理的折衷方案，更没有任何理由反对我方所提出的完全合乎中立国定义的中立国提名。对方二十五日在会上所建议的双方各提两个中立国以代替双方各提三个中立国的数目，对方又只提瑞士、瑞典两国，而要求我方只提波兰、捷克斯洛伐克两国的方法，只是一种无理反对我方提出苏联为中立国的手段。任何对于我方完全合乎中立国定义的提名的无理反对，是我方所绝对不能考虑的，我方断然予以拒绝。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，对方仍执意避开停战后双方释放并遣返其所收容的全部战俘的原则问题不谈，双方仅就已经在实质上达成协议的各款的措辞方面，继续交换了意见。
