Xinhua News Agency, 27th: London Dispatch: British Prime Minister Churchill's threatening speech in the U.S. Congress on the 17th, intimidating the Chinese and Korean people, has aroused angry protests from the British people and caused serious confusion within the British ruling group. Immediately after Churchill delivered his speech, the United Press International reported from London that Churchill's threatening "hints" had "caused a great uproar in Britain."

    The pro-Labour "Reynolds News" admitted that Churchill's attempt to intimidate the Chinese people was futile. After pointing out that "American policy is to use threats... to force an armistice in Korea according to General Ridgway's conditions," it stated clearly that "all evidence shows that China will not be intimidated." Although Churchill could not intimidate the Chinese people, he did intimidate the British ruling group. The British ruling group feared that Churchill's further surrender to American adventurous policies would put them in the face of a serious crisis of popular resistance. The accusations against Churchill first came from the opposition party of the current government—the Labour Party. On the 23rd, the Labour Party's National Executive Committee decided to question Churchill in the House of Commons, asking him to explain what Far Eastern policy he and Truman had agreed upon in their Washington talks. On the 24th, Younger, former Minister of State in the Labour government, delivered a speech accusing Churchill of possibly having taken Britain onto "a slippery slope, the bottom of which is war against China." Younger rebuked Churchill's actions for potentially expanding a war that would be extremely detrimental to Britain, "Therefore, one cannot but view Mr. Churchill's role in Washington with serious anxiety." United Press International believed that Younger's accusation was an important sign "sufficient to reflect the growing concern here about how Churchill has agreed to support American Far Eastern policy in Washington."

    Accusations against Churchill's speech also came from groups close to the Conservative Party, and even from within the Conservative Party itself. According to the Labour Party's "People," "Rebellious Conservative members are uneasy about the series of concessions Churchill has made to Truman..." Thus, Churchill's wild words in Washington not only failed to achieve his intimidating purpose but also brought great trouble to his extremely fragile Conservative government. According to the United Press International, the day after Churchill's speech, the British Foreign Office, "under siege by a flood of questions," was forced to announce that although Churchill and the American government had reached a "broad agreement" on the Korean issue, there was no "specific agreement," in an attempt to perfunctorily dismiss the issue. However, the problem could not be resolved in this way. The United Press International has predicted that when the British Parliament reconvenes on January 29, "the most intense debate will take place." The Conservative government, with only a slim majority, is bound to be in a difficult situation under questioning from all sides.

### 邱吉尔在华盛顿虚张声势的演说  引起英统治阶级严重混乱

    邱吉尔在华盛顿虚张声势的演说  
    引起英统治阶级严重混乱
    【新华社二十七日讯】伦敦消息：英国首相邱吉尔十七日在美国国会发表的虚声恫吓中朝人民的演说，激起了英国人民愤怒的抗议，也引起了英国统治集团内部严重的混乱。紧接着邱吉尔发表演说以后，合众社从伦敦发出的消息就说：邱吉尔的威胁性“暗示”，“已在英国引起了轩然大波”。
    接近工党的“雷诺新闻”承认，邱吉尔想恫吓中国人民是白费心思。它在指出“美国的政策是想以威胁的手段……来强迫按照李奇微将军的条件在朝鲜停战”以后，明白地说“一切证据显示：中国是不会被吓倒的。”虽然邱吉尔不能吓倒中国人民，但是他却吓倒了英国统治集团。英国统治集团害怕邱吉尔向美国冒险政策的进一步投降，会使他们面临人民反抗的严重危机。对邱吉尔的指责首先来自现政府的反对党——工党。二十三日，工党全国执行委员会决定要在下院质问邱吉尔，要他解释他和杜鲁门在华盛顿会谈中所商定的远东政策究竟是什么。二十四日，前工党政府国务大臣杨格又发表演说，指责邱吉尔可能已把英国带到“一个滑溜的斜坡上，坡底就是对中国的战争”。杨格斥责邱吉尔的举动可能会扩大对英国极为不利的战争，“因此，人们不能不抱着严重的焦虑来看待邱吉尔先生在华盛顿所扮演的角色。”合众社认为杨格的指责是一个重要的迹象，“足以反映此间愈来愈关心邱吉尔在华盛顿究竟怎样答应支持美国的远东政策。”
    对邱吉尔演说的指责，也来自接近保守党的集团，甚至保守党内部。据工党的“人民报”透露：“反叛的保守党员对邱吉尔向杜鲁门所作的一系列让步……表示不安”。这样，邱吉尔在华盛顿的狂言乱语，不但不能达到其吓人的目的，反而还替自己基础极其脆弱的保守党政府招来了极大的麻烦。据合众社透露：在邱吉尔演说之后的第二天，英国外交部“在纷至沓来的问题围攻下”，竟不得不被迫宣布，邱吉尔和美国政府虽然已就朝鲜问题获致“广泛协议”，但并未有“具体约定”，企图以此搪塞。但是，问题并不能因此解决。合众社已预料，在英国议会在一月二十九日复会时，“将进行最激烈的辩论”。只有微弱多数的保守党政府，势必在各方质询下处于狼狈的境地。
