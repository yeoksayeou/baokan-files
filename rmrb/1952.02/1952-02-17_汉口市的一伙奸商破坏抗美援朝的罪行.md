A Gang of Unscrupulous Merchants in Hankou Sabotages the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea
Shen Shi

While the entire country is vigorously advancing the movement to resist US aggression and aid Korea, and while the Chinese People's Volunteers are bravely striking the enemy in Korea, a gang of unscrupulous merchants in Wuhan is frantically engaging in sabotage while undertaking the production and purchase of military supplies to support the front lines. The people of the whole country will recognize from the crimes of this gang of unscrupulous merchants that they are criminals against the people and accomplices of imperialism.

In addition to the case of Li Yinting, the manager and unscrupulous merchant of Fuhua Electric Cotton Wool Factory, who used rotten cotton to manufacture "emergency kits" and stole 1.8 billion yuan of the people's funds to support the volunteers, resulting in harm to many wounded soldiers (as reported on page 2 of this newspaper on February 15), there are many other abhorrent incidents:

Last summer, various government agencies and schools in Wuhan undertook an urgent task of stir-frying military rice for the volunteers. Tens of thousands of government workers, teachers, and students worked day and night, sweating profusely to stir-fry the raw rice. Many innocent and lovely Young Pioneers worried that bad elements would poison the rice, some slept with the rice bags, and some wouldn't even let their mothers near the place where the rice was being stir-fried; they even hugged the stir-fried rice that hadn't been sent away when they slept. They loved their most beloved people so much. How could they have imagined that unscrupulous merchants would steal good rice and replace it with bad rice? Peng Xicheng, the deputy manager and unscrupulous merchant of Daxing Rice Mill, stole a total of 2,000 jin of good rice, which was to be processed and used as stir-fried rice, and replaced it with bad rice that was already heating up, had worms on the edges, and had lost 40% of its nutritional content.

Last year, the Korean front line received a large batch of shovels and pickaxes. The volunteer soldiers happily picked up the military tools shipped from the motherland and began digging shelters or air-raid trenches, but unexpectedly, they bent with a single step and were all unusable. How could they have known that this was the crime committed by Zhou Zexin and Liu Fuxing, unscrupulous merchants in Wuhan?

In December 1950, the volunteer procurement agency and Zhou Hengshun Iron Factory boss and unscrupulous merchant Zhou Zexin and Liu Fuxing Iron Factory unscrupulous merchant Liu Wenqing signed a contract to produce a batch of dual-purpose and single-purpose military shovels and pickaxes. The contract originally stipulated that the shovels should be made of 7.3-li iron plates; at that time, such iron plates were in short supply in Wuhan, and both parties agreed to change to 6.3-li iron plates. Of the 40,000 shovels produced by Zhou, all were replaced with iron sheets made from sugar barrels and old gasoline barrels with a thickness of only a little more than 5 li, causing the people's funds to support the volunteers to lose 440 million yuan, and Zhou made a huge profit of more than 230 million yuan. In order to achieve the goal of obtaining huge profits, Zhou bribed Yang Ze, the cadre sent to the iron factory for supervision and acceptance, five times, but was rejected each time. Finally, Zhou used his niece Zhou Furong to attack Yang Ze, using marriage as bait, and Yang Ze finally became a captive of the unscrupulous merchant. Yang was so dizzy that he did not carefully inspect the finished products and refused the inspection of other comrades. This batch of bad shovels was shipped to the Korean front line.

Of the 30,000 pickaxes ordered from the Liu Fuxing factory, 16,000 have been found to be made from old gasoline barrels. Furthermore, the contract stipulated that the pickaxes should be made of square iron (good iron, 2,500 yuan per jin), but Liu Wenqing added one-third of pitted iron (miscellaneous iron, 1,600 yuan per jin: this kind of iron cannot be used to make pickaxes); according to the regulations, blue brand steel (first-class steel, 16,000 yuan per jin) should be used, but Liu used bamboo steel (second-class steel, 5,600 yuan per jin) instead. Even worse, some didn't use any steel at all, but smeared a little sodium acetate powder or yellow diarrhea powder on the iron, and after burning it in the fire, it looked exactly the same as if steel had been added. Liu also bribed Shi Bin, the cadre sent to manage the order and expedite the work, by introducing a wife to Shi Bin. Whenever Shi Bin saw signs of cutting corners, Liu smiled and said, "This is okay! It needs to be corrected! Forget it, forget it! Let's go, Lao Shi..." Shi Bin was hit by such "sugar-coated bullets."

Last June, the China Industrial Equipment Company Central South District Company and Hankou Donghua Company signed a contract to purchase 1,200 coils of military covered wire (electrical wire). This batch of covered wire was to be shipped to the Korean front line, with a total value of 2.34 billion yuan. Yan Guitang, the manager and unscrupulous merchant of Donghua Company, colluded with Guo Rong, the chief of the business section of the Industrial Equipment Company Central South District Company and a major corrupt official, to ship a batch of covered wire with rotten insulation and rusty wire cores to Hankou. Yan then worked on Guo Rong, instructing Ma Langao and other employees of the district company to process this batch of bad covered wire by brushing it with oil and selling it to the district company at 80% of the original price. These criminals were so mad that they invited the procurement personnel sent by the China Industrial Equipment Company Northeast District Company to Hankou to the "Zimei Restaurant," got them drunk with wine, and then finalized the transaction. They then shipped this batch of bad covered wire to the Northeast overnight. Because this batch of covered wire was originally waste, it was completely unusable, causing huge losses to the funds of the people of the motherland in support of the volunteers, and directly hindering the military needs of the front line.

Some food stores in Hankou cut corners when producing biscuits for the volunteers, and added a large amount of syrup and saccharin to the biscuits, causing the biscuits to deteriorate. Some canvas factories stole eight inches of canvas per frame when making stretchers for the volunteers. Lekang Pharmaceutical Factory manufactured a large number of fake medicines, and even important medicines such as vitamin K used to stop bleeding were all fake. How can these criminal facts not arouse the vehement hatred of patriotic people! These heinous unscrupulous merchants must be punished most severely!

    汉口市的一伙奸商破坏抗美援朝的罪行
    沈石
    当着全国如火如荼地推进抗美援朝运动的时候，当着中国人民志愿军在朝鲜英勇地打击敌人的时候，武汉市一伙奸商，在承制和承购支援朝鲜前线的军用物资中，却疯狂地进行破坏。全国人民将从这伙奸商的罪行中认识到他们是人民的罪人和帝国主义的帮凶。
    除了福华电机药棉厂经理奸商李寅廷用烂棉花制造“救急包”，盗窃祖国人民支援志愿军的款项十八亿元，结果坑害了许多伤员的事情（本报二月十五日第二版消息）以外，还有许多令人切齿的事：
    去年夏天，武汉市各机关和学校，担任了一项给志愿军赶炒军米的紧急任务。成千成万的机关工作人员和教师学生，昼夜不停地汗流浃背地把生米炒熟。许多天真可爱的儿童队员担心坏分子在米里放毒，有的抱着米袋一道睡觉，有的连自己的母亲也不让她走近炒米的地方；他们睡觉时还把炒好而还没有送走的米抱着。他们是这样热爱他们最可爱的人。他们那里会想到奸商把坏米盗换好米这一回事呢？大兴米厂副经理、奸商彭锡承，把已经发热、边缘生虫、营养料减去四成的坏米，盗换了准备加工后用作炒米的好米共二千斤。
    去年，朝鲜前线收到了一大批铁锹和铁镐。志愿军的战士们兴高采烈地拿起了远从祖国运来的军用工具，挖掘掩蔽工事或防空壕的时候，不料一踩就弯，全部不能使用。他们那里会知道这是武汉市奸商周泽信和刘福兴干出的罪恶勾当呢？
    一九五零年十二月，志愿军采购机关和汉口周恒顺铁工厂老板奸商周泽信及刘福兴铁工厂奸商刘文清订立合同，承制一批双用和单用的军事铁锹、铁镐。合同上原规定铁锹要用七点三厘的铁板制造；当时武汉市面这样的铁板缺货，双方同意改用六点三厘的铁板。周犯承制的四万把铁锹中，全部以糖精桶和旧汽油桶改锤成的仅五厘多厚的铁皮代替铁板，使人民支援志愿军的款项损失四亿四千万元，周犯获暴利二亿三千多万元。周犯为了达到获取暴利的目的，曾五次贿买派到铁工厂监工及验收的干部杨则，都被拒绝。最后，周犯又利用他的侄孙女周福荣向杨则进攻，用结婚来引诱，杨则终于当了奸商的俘虏。杨某被弄得神魂颠倒，不认真检查成品，并且拒绝其他同志的检查。这批坏铁锹就被运到了朝鲜前线。
    在奸商刘福兴厂定制的三万把铁锹，已被发现有一万六千把是用旧汽油桶改制的。又合同上规定制铁镐要用方铁（好铁、二千五百元一斤），刘犯文清加了三分之一的麻子铁（杂铁、一千六百元一斤：这种铁是不能用来打镐的）；照规定应该使用蓝牌钢（一等钢，一万六千元一斤），刘犯却用竹节钢（次等钢，五千六百元一斤）代替。更坏的甚至不用一点钢，抹一点酸纳药粉或黄泻银药粉在铁上，用火一烧就和加了钢的一模一样。刘犯还贿买派去管定货和催工的干部石彬，给石彬介绍老婆。每当石彬见到偷工减料的现象时，刘犯就笑嘻嘻地说：“这还行！要改正！算了算了！走吧老石…”石彬就在这样的“糖衣炮弹”进攻下被打中了。
    去年六月，中国工业器材公司中南区公司和汉口东华行制订收购军用被覆线（电线）一千二百圈的合同。这批被覆线是运往朝鲜前线的，总价值二十三亿四千万元。东华行经理奸商严贵堂勾结工业器材公司中南区公司业务科科长大贪污犯郭瑢等，把一批绝缘体腐烂、线心生锈的被覆线运到汉口、严犯又活动郭瑢，主使区公司职员马兰皋等，把这批坏的被覆线加工刷油，以原价八折，卖给区公司。这批罪犯竟丧心病狂地把中国工业器材公司东北区公司派来汉口的采购人员，邀到“滋美餐厅”，用酒把他们灌醉后，谈成交易，接着就连夜把这批坏的被覆线发往东北。因为这批被覆线本来就是废品，全部不能使用，使祖国人民支援志愿军的资财遭受巨大的损失，并直接妨碍了前线的军事需要。
    汉口某些食品店在给志愿军承制饼干时，偷工减料，并且在饼干中掺进大量的糖稀和糖精，使饼干变质。某些帆布工厂在给志愿军做担架时，每架要偷帆布八寸。乐康药厂大量制造假药，甚至连用来止血的维他命K这样重要的药品，也都通统是假的。这些罪恶事实怎能不引起爱国人民的切齿痛恨！这些罪大恶极的奸商，一定要受到最严厉的惩办！
