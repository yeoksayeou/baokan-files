Returning from School (A Sketch of the Korean Battlefield, Part One)
    Shao Yu
    November 17, 1951, a village on the banks of the Daedong River. In the afternoon, the children went to school in the mountain caves. Returning from school, what a wonderful moment for the children! Telling their father and mother about the new lessons they learned; their stomachs are also hungry, and their mother must have already prepared dinner. But alas! Where is home? Where are father and mother? The Daedong River flows on and on! Children! Remember the hatred in your hearts!

    散学归来（朝鲜战场素描之一）
    邵宇
    一九五一年十一月十七日，大同江畔的一个村庄，下午，孩子们到山洞里上学去了。散学回来，是孩子们一个多么好的时刻！把新学的功课告诉爸爸和妈妈；肚子也饿了，想必是妈妈早把晚饭做好了。可是啊！家哪？爸爸、妈妈哪？大同江水啊——滚滚地流！孩子们！仇恨牢记在心头！
