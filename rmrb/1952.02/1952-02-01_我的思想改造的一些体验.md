It is difficult for people who have been active on the old political stage to remold their thinking. Because in the past they represented classes with different interests and had different opinions, over time, they developed deep prejudices. To carry out in-depth self-examination is extremely painful.

I know the joys and sorrows of this. For example, in the early years of the Republic of China, although I made some reforms in the form and content of newspapers when I ran the "National Public Newspaper," I also received high salaries and other ill-gotten gains. My life was distressed, and I had all kinds of conflicting thoughts, which led to a nervous breakdown. It was not until later, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, that I thoroughly examined my past behavior and made radical changes in my actions, that I felt enlightened and infinitely comfortable.

Therefore, I hope that people who have had experiences like mine can closely relate to themselves while studying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly expose and criticize their old ideas. Only in this way can they eliminate their past mistakes, wash away their accumulated dirt, and truly remold their thinking.

From Old Democracy to New Democracy

When I studied in England, I was extremely fond of British philosophy and political and economic theories, especially worshiping British parliamentary politics. At that time, I was determined to do three things: start a newspaper, organize a political party, and be elected as a member of parliament. After returning to China, I encountered the Xinhai Revolution, and these three things were realized one by one. However, the actual experience was completely opposite to my previous expectations. After Yuan Shikai dissolved the parliament, I tried to find out the reasons why Yuan Shikai was able to dissolve the parliament. I realized that the election of members of parliament at that time was not based on the registration and voting of the vast majority of the people, but was monopolized by a small group of local tyrants and gentry through various improper means. For example, the officials and gentry in Jiangsu Province stole the names on grain serials and hired people to vote, one person voting dozens or hundreds of times at a time, creating candidates elected in the preliminary election of members of the House of Representatives (in the early years of the Republic of China, the parliament was a secondary election system, and members of the House of Representatives were elected by those elected in the preliminary election). The Senate was elected by members of the provincial assembly, but they could use joint methods, and one person with more than ten votes could be elected. And the election of provincial assembly members was the same as that of members of the House of Representatives. Therefore, all members of parliament were not elected by the people, and of course, were not representatives of the people. Their existence or dissolution had nothing to do with the people. The Kuomintang relied on the governors of several southern provinces as their talisman. When the governors were overthrown by Yuan Shikai, the Kuomintang members of parliament were finished. The Progressive Party relied on Yuan Shikai. When Yuan Shikai did not need them, the Progressive Party members of parliament were also finished. At that time, some people in the parliament were well aware of this crisis and wanted to formulate a constitution to consolidate the position of the parliament. But these members of parliament, who did not have the support of the people, could not possibly formulate a constitution that was supported by the people. Moreover, none of the draft constitutions formulated at that time was directly related to the interests of the people, so their failure was inevitable. After I figured out this reason, I thought that although the democratic system of Europe and the United States was "good," it might not be applicable in China. After a period of time, I further understood the situation of the parliaments of Japan, France, and the United States, and realized that all political parties and parliaments in these countries were controlled by financial groups, and their corruption and darkness far exceeded that of the Chinese parliament. Therefore, I deeply felt that the democratic system of Europe and the United States itself contained great shortcomings. Later, I read Dicey's "Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution," and learned that after the members of the British Parliament were elected, they had nothing to do with the voters and acted freely, not restricted by the voters at all, so they were not representatives of the voters. Therefore, I concluded that the democratic system of Europe and the United States, centered on parliament, was not true democracy. Soon after the success of the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, the May Fourth Movement occurred in China, and my thinking also underwent many changes. In terms of the old democratic political theory, I thought that Rousseau's general will theory in "The Social Contract," although very insightful, believed that the general will of the people could not be grasped and was divided into group will, party will, etc.; only through these wills could an approximate general will be achieved, so he advocated multi-party politics. Modern France is a multi-party political system, which seems to have realized Rousseau's theory; but French politics is still controlled by a few people, violating the will of the majority of the people. At that time, although I knew that the old democratic system was the democracy of a few people, I lacked understanding of the working class and peasants, and always thought that the masses had no political ideals and could not implement democracy. Later, when I arrived in the old liberated areas, everything I saw and heard completely changed my thinking. I visited village elections, participated in various meetings, and lived in rural areas for a long time, observing various movements of farmers, such as land reform, supporting the front lines, participating in the army, etc. I realized that farmers had a high degree of political consciousness under the leadership of the Communist Party. Later, in my studies and actual work, I further realized that the working class and peasants can be masters of their own affairs and manage themselves. All political tasks and production undertakings cannot be done well without the support of the working class and peasants. In this way, I began to understand the true content of New Democracy and learned about the content of a higher level of democracy - the democracy of the proletariat.

The Pursuit of a New Outlook on Life

I have been searching for the meaning of life all my life. For decades, I have stumbled here and there, and only when I found Marxism-Leninism did I truly understand life.

In my early years, I studied Buddhism with Gui Bohua. In middle age, due to political distress, I studied Buddhism again. I have read many scriptures and theories, and finally found a central problem, that is, no matter how subtle the reasoning of any scripture or theory, it ultimately boils down to a cycle of reincarnation. The so-called liberation is only to be liberated from reincarnation; and liberation from reincarnation is extremely difficult, and must go through countless "kalpas" as described in the Consciousness-Only theory. But later I discovered that if there is no reincarnation, wouldn't all these troubles naturally disappear? Therefore, I denied reincarnation and no longer consulted scriptures or talked about cultivation.

I have dabbled in the important works of Plato, Kant, Hegel, Spinoza and others. But after many years, I realized that these philosophical theories, no matter how exquisite their logic, will eventually be like what Kant said about all metaphysics: they all want to prove the existence of God, freedom of will, and the immortality of the soul. Therefore, these philosophical works could not solve my life problems.

I have also put my mind on Neo-Confucianism. When talking about Neo-Confucianism, I thought of Mr. Liang Rengong. In his later years, Mr. Liang Rengong wanted to govern the world with Wang Yangming's theory. The central idea of Wang Yangming is to extend innate knowledge. To extend innate knowledge, one must first have a unique and unchanging innate knowledge. But the realistic innate knowledge is extremely different. Landlords have the innate knowledge of landlords, farmers have the innate knowledge of farmers, workers have the innate knowledge of workers, and capitalists have the innate knowledge of capitalists, which are different and opposed to each other, and extending innate knowledge becomes a meaningless empty phrase. Therefore, Yangming's theory could not solve life problems.

The reason why I often had life problems was because after 1923, although I severed all political relations, I could not find something truly beneficial to do. Teaching and writing articles were subject to the political oppression of the time, and there was no room for free expression. I felt very distressed, so I began to doubt life. After years of hard exploration, I still could not find a way out. It was not until later that I read some Marxist-Leninist books that I began to have a correct understanding of society and life. During the Anti-Japanese War, I did some anti-Japanese work and was captured by the Japanese invaders and imprisoned for nearly a year. I further developed a revolutionary outlook on life. Later, when I arrived in the old liberated areas, I truly understood that serving the people is the most correct outlook on life, and serving the people more can expand the value of life. In the past, I also wanted to eliminate all the evils and sufferings of mankind, but at that time it was just an empty wish. Since I arrived in the old liberated areas and followed the Chinese Communist Party to study, I gradually understood the specific conditions and steps to realize this wish, and my revolutionary outlook on life became even more firm.

The above situation can only show that I have just touched the doorway on the road of ideological remolding; but this doorway is very important to me. I am determined to continue to deepen from this doorway and strive for progress.

    我的思想改造的一些体验
    蓝公武
    在旧的政治舞台上进行过活动的人，要改造思想，是困难的。因为他们过去代表利害各殊的阶级，有各种不同的见解，经历一久，就有很深的成见，要进行深入的检讨，就有极大的苦痛。
    我是知道这里头的甘苦的。例如我在民国初年，虽曾在办“国民公报”时，对报纸的形式和内容上有了一些改革；但自己也曾领取过高额干薪及其他不义之财，并且生活苦闷，有各种矛盾心理，以致发生神经错乱。一直到后来接受了马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的指导，自己对过去的行为进行了详尽的检讨，并在行动上加以彻底的改变，心里才豁然开朗，感到无限的舒适。
    因此，希望有像我那样经历的人，也能在学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想当中密切地联系自己，彻底暴露和批判自己的旧思想。只有这样，才能清除自己旧日的错误，洗清自己的积污，真正改造自己的思想。
    由旧民主到新民主
    我在英国留学时代极倾心英国的哲学和政治、经济的学说，尤其是崇拜英国的议会政治。当时立志要做三件事：创办报社、组织政党、当选议员。回国以后，遇着辛亥革命，这三件事一一实现。可是实际的经验和以前的期望完全相反。在袁世凯解散国会后，我就推求袁世凯能够解散国会的原因，觉悟到当时国会议员的选举，并未由绝大多数人民登记投票，仅由一小撮土豪劣绅，用种种不正当的方法包办推选。例如江苏省官僚豪绅盗用粮串上的人名，雇人投票，一人一次，投数十票或数百票，制造出众议员初选当选人（民国初年国会是复选制，众院议员由初选当选人选举）。参院则由省议会议员选举，但可以用联合方法，一人有十余票即可当选。而省议员之选举又是和众议员相同的。因此，所有国会议员都不是人民所选举的，当然不是人民的代表，其存在或解散，都和人民无关。国民党是以南方几省都督为护符的。都督被袁世凯打倒，国民党议员就完蛋。进步党是以袁世凯为靠山的。在袁世凯不需要时，进步党议员也就完蛋。当时国会中有一些人，深知这种危机，很想制定宪法，来巩固国会地位。但这些没有得到人民拥护的议员，要制定一个为人民拥护的宪法，是不可能的。况且当时所制定的宪法草案，也没有一条是和人民直接利益有关的，所以他们的失败是必然的。我想通这个道理以后，便认为欧美民主制度虽“好”，恐怕不能在中国适用。过了一个时期，我进一步去了解日、法、美三国议会的情形，才知道这些国家的一切政党和国会，都受财阀操纵，其腐败黑暗，远过中国之国会。因而我深深感到欧美这种民主制度本身是包含着绝大缺点的。后来我读英国戴雪的英宪精义，知道英国国会议员自当选以后，就和选民无关，自由行动，丝毫不受选民限制，故非选民代表。于是我断定以议会为中心的欧美民主制度并不是真民主。不久苏联十月革命成功，中国发生了五四运动，我的思想也有了许多转变。在旧民主主义政治理论方面，我认为卢梭民约论的总意说，虽很精辟，但是他以为人民总意无法把握，又分为团体意志、党派意志等等；要通过这些意志，才能达到近似的总意，所以他主张多党政治。法国近代是多党政治，似乎实现了卢梭的理论；但法国政治依然是操在少数人手中，违反大多数人民意志的。我当时对于旧民主制度虽然知道是少数人的民主，但我对于工农大众却缺乏了解，总以为群众是没有政治理想，是不能实行民主的。后来到了老解放区，一切所见所闻，使我的思想全然改变。我参观了村选举，参加了各种会议，在农村中又居住很久，观察了农民的各种运动，如土地改革、支援前线、参加军队等等运动，认识了农民在共产党领导下是有高度的政治觉悟的。其后我在学习中，在实际工作中，更进一步认识到工农大众是能当家作主、自己管理自己的事的。一切政治任务、生产事业如得不到工农大众的拥护，是一点也不能搞好的。这样一来，我就开始认识了新民主主义的真实内容，并了解到更高度的民主——无产阶级的民主——的内容。
    新人生观的追寻
    我生平在追寻人生的意义。几十年来，不知从这里头打了多少筋斗，到后来找到马克思列宁主义，才真正懂得人生。
    早年，我曾从桂伯华学佛。中年，因有政治烦闷，又再度学佛。我看过了不少经论，最后发现一个中心问题，即任何经论，不问其推论如何微妙，归根结底，只是一个轮回问题。所谓解脱，只是要解脱轮回；而解脱轮回，又千难万难，必须像唯识论中所说的，要经过无数“劫数”。但后来我发现：如果没有轮回，这种种苦恼岂不自然消灭？因此，我否定了轮回，不再参经论、谈修持了。
    我曾涉猎过柏拉图、康德、黑格尔、斯宾诺莎等人的重要著作。但经过多少年后，我觉悟到这些哲学理论，不问其逻辑如何精妙，最后必然像康德对于一切玄学所说的话：都是想证明上帝存在，意志自由，灵魂不灭等。因之这些哲学著作解决不了我的人生问题。
    我也曾在理学上费过心思。谈理学便想到梁任公先生。梁任公先生晚年要以王阳明学说治世。王阳明的中心思想是致良知。致良知必须先有一个唯一不变的良知。但现实的良知，却是极其不同的。地主有地主的良知，农民有农民的良知，工人有工人的良知，资本家有资本家的良知，各不相同，互相对立，致良知便成了一句无意义的空话。因之阳明学说解决不了人生问题。
    我所以常有人生问题，是因为在民国十二年后，虽然断绝一切政治关系，却找不到一件真正有益的事做。教书做文章，都要受到当时政治的压迫，毫无自由发挥的余地，自己感到很苦闷，于是对人生发生怀疑。经过长年的辛苦探索，仍然找不到出路。只是到了后来，自己读了一些马克思列宁主义书籍，才开始对社会人生有了正确的了解。在抗日时期中，我做了一些抗日工作，被日寇捕去，坐了将近一年的牢狱，我进一步有了革命的人生观。以后到了老解放区，我才真正了解为人民服务是最正确的人生观，多为人民服务，便可以扩大人生的价值。我在以前也曾想要消灭人类的一切罪恶、一切苦痛，但在当时不过是一个空洞的意愿，自到老解放区跟着中国共产党学习，逐渐了解实现这种意愿的具体条件和进行步骤，我的革命人生观，就更加确定了。
    以上的情形，虽然只能说明我在思想改造的道路上刚刚摸到了门径；但是这个门径对于我是非常重要的。我决心由此门径继续深入，力求进步。
