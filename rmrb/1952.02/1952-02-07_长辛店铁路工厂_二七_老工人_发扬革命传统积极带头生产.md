    "February 7th" Old Workers of Changxindian Railway Factory
    Carry Forward Revolutionary Tradition and Take the Lead in Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, 6th] The old workers of Changxindian Railway Factory who participated in the "February 7th" strike are carrying forward the glorious tradition of the "February 7th" revolution and are playing a leading role in production. Wang Guizong, a foreman in the locomotive branch of the Changxindian Railway Factory, was the leader of the picket team of the Changxindian Railway Factory's trade union during the "February 7th" strike. Since liberation, he has been actively involved in production, improving tools and work methods a total of eleven times. After he improved the work methods, the efficiency of adjusting locomotive steam valves increased sixtyfold. In 1950, he was named a labor model for the entire factory, and last September, he was selected as a representative to attend the National Railway Labor Model Representative Conference. Li Zhenshan, a riveter foreman in the freight car branch of the Changxindian Railway Factory, was an active participant in the "February 7th" strike. He was selected as a first-class labor model for the entire factory due to his special contributions to production. The new method he created for modifying freight car couplers saves locomotive traction power and can save a large amount of materials. From March to June last year alone, the Changxindian Railway Factory saved more than 130 million yuan in the work of modifying freight car couplers. Last year, his team, in anticipation of May Day and National Day, produced one more boxcar each time in addition to completing their tasks. Under his leadership, the other three riveting teams in the freight car branch also each produced one more boxcar. Wang Chunrong, the model carpenter team leader of the passenger car branch of the Changxindian Railway Factory, served as an investigator for the picket team during the "February 7th" strike. He puts his heart and soul into carpentry work, using wood rationally, and even tries to piece together and utilize small pieces of wood that are cut off. His spirit of saving wealth for the country has moved all the carpenters. Everyone is learning from his method of saving wood.

    长辛店铁路工厂“二七”老工人
    发扬革命传统积极带头生产
    【新华社六日讯】曾经参加过“二七”大罢工的长辛店铁路工厂的老工人，发扬“二七”革命光荣传统，在生产中起着带头作用。长辛店铁路工厂机车分厂领工员王贵宗，在“二七”罢工时是长辛店铁路工厂工会纠察队的组长。解放以后，他积极生产，改进工具和工作方法共十一次。经过他改进工作方法后，调整机车汽阀工作的效率提高了六十倍。一九五○年他被评选为全厂的劳动模范，去年九月他又被选为出席全国铁路劳动模范代表大会的代表。长辛店铁路工厂货车分厂的铆工工长李振山，是“二七”罢工时的积极参加者。他因在生产中有特殊贡献被选为全厂的一等劳动模范。他所创造的改造货车车钩新办法，使机车牵引省力，并可节省大量材料。仅去年三月到六月，长辛店铁路工厂在改造货车车钩的工作上，就节省一亿三千多万元。去年他所领导的小组，在迎接“五一”节和国庆节时，除完成任务以外，每次都多造了一辆棚车。货车分厂其他三个铆工小组在他带动下，也各多造了一辆棚车。长辛店铁路工厂客车分厂的模范木工组组长王春荣，“二七”罢工时曾担任纠察队的调查员。他做木工活时用尽心思，合理运用木料，就连截下来的小块木材，他也要设法拼凑利用。他这种为国家节省财富的精神感动了所有木工。大家都学习他这种节省木材的办法。
