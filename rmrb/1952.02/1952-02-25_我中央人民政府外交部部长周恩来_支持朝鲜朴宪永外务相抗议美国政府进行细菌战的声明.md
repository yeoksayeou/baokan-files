    I, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government Zhou Enlai,
    Support the Statement of the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Park Heon-young Protesting the U.S. Government's Use of Germ Warfare
    Based on reliable materials from the front-line headquarters of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, the U.S. invading army has, since January 28, 1952, repeatedly used larger-scale bacterial weapons with the aim of killing Korean peaceful people and soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers. Park Heon-young, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement on February 22 of this year protesting this new criminal act and calling on the people of the world to stop the atrocities of the U.S. imperialists and to investigate the international responsibility of the organizers who used bacterial weapons. I am now authorized to formally declare that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people fully support this just demand of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    As is well known, U.S. imperialism's use of bacterial weapons in its intervention in the Korean War did not begin this time. As early as the period from December 1950 to January 1951, when the U.S. invading army was retreating southward from north of the 38th parallel under the joint attack of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, it scattered smallpox bacteria in Pyongyang, Gangwon Province, South Hamgyong Province, Hwanghae Province, and other areas. The U.S. invading army's evil act of continuously using airplanes to drop large quantities of insect bacteria on the front-line positions and rear areas of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers further proves that the U.S. government is continuing to carry out planned and prepared inhuman germ warfare. As long as the people of the world face this fact squarely, they cannot but admit that the U.S. government is currently a war criminal who, in order to carry out aggressive war, does not hesitate to violate any international conventions and is the first to use bacterial weapons.
    In its conspiracy to undermine world peace and prepare for world war, U.S. imperialism first used Japanese germ warfare criminals such as Shiro Ishii, Jiro Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano, whose hands were already stained with the blood of the Chinese and Korean peoples, on the Korean battlefield to conduct various deadly bacterial experiments and manufacturing. Hundreds and thousands of captured soldiers of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers became victims under these bacterial weapons experiments. Now U.S. imperialism is using these tested bacterial weapons to kill peaceful people in Korea. If the people of the world do not resolutely stop it, then the disaster that has befallen the peaceful people of Korea today will befall the peaceful people of the world tomorrow. Therefore, this criminal activity of U.S. imperialism in conducting germ warfare has already proven that it is the most dangerous enemy of the Chinese and Korean people and the peace-loving people of the world.
    It must be pointed out that U.S. imperialism suffered heavy blows from the heroic Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers in the Korean War it launched and was forced to conduct armistice negotiations. However, in the course of the negotiations, it was unwilling to accept its defeat in the Korean War. On the one hand, it used various shameless delaying tactics to obstruct the progress of the negotiations, and on the other hand, it carried out inhuman germ warfare in the hope of prolonging and expanding the Korean War in order to realize its aggressive conspiracy to undermine the People's Republic of China and peace and security in the Far East. The Chinese people are determined and will inevitably shatter this shameless conspiracy and criminal act of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism will not only fail to achieve its criminal goals, but will inevitably swallow its own shameful bitter fruit under the righteous anger of the peace-loving people of the world.
    I now represent the Chinese people in accusing the U.S. government to the people of the world for its heinous crimes against humanity, violating international conventions, and using bacterial weapons in Korea to kill peaceful people and armed soldiers, and I call on all peace-loving people around the world to take action to stop this insane criminal act of the U.S. government. The Chinese people will, together with the people of the world, resolutely fight to the end to stop this insane crime of the U.S. government.
    February 24, 1952

    我中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来
    支持朝鲜朴宪永外务相抗议美国政府进行细菌战的声明
    根据朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军前线司令部的确实材料，美国侵略军自一九五二年一月二十八日起，连续多次使用以虐杀朝鲜和平人民及朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军为目的的、更大规模的细菌武器。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府朴宪永外务相，于本年二月二十二日发表声明，抗议这种新的罪恶行为，并号召全世界人民制止美帝国主义者的暴行，追究使用细菌武器的组织者的国际责任。我现受权正式声明：中华人民共和国中央人民政府和中国人民完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府这一正义的主张。
    如所周知，美帝国主义在其干涉朝鲜战争中使用细菌武器，并不是从这次开始的。远在一九五○年十二月至一九五一年一月的期间，美国侵略军在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军联合打击之下，从三八线以北向南撤退时，就曾在平壤市、江原道、咸镜南道、黄海道以及其他几个地区散布天花细菌。这次美国侵略军又在朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军前线阵地和后方连续用飞机撒下大批昆虫细菌的罪恶行动，更加证明美国政府是在继续有计划地、有准备地进行绝灭人性的细菌战。全世界的人民，只要正视这一事实，都不能不承认美国政府是目前世界上为了进行侵略战争，不惜破坏任何国际公约而首先使用细菌武器的战争罪犯。
    美帝国主义在其破坏世界和平、准备世界战争的阴谋中，首先在朝鲜战场上，利用石井四郎、若松次郎、北野政藏等等手上早已染有中朝两国人民鲜血的日本细菌战犯，进行各种致命细菌的试验和制造。成百成千的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员，在这些细菌武器的试验下，都成了牺牲者。现在美帝国主义就使用这些试验过的细菌武器，来虐杀朝鲜的和平人民。如果全世界人民不坚决地加以制止，那么，今天落在朝鲜和平人民头上的灾难，明天就会落在世界和平人民的头上。因此，美帝国主义这种进行细菌战的罪恶活动，业已证明它是中朝人民以及全世界和平人民的最危险的敌人。
    必须指出：美帝国主义在其所发动的干涉朝鲜战争中，遭受了英勇的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的惨重打击，被迫而进行停战谈判，但在谈判的进行中，又不甘心其在干涉朝鲜战争中的失败，于是一面使用种种无耻的拖延战术，来阻挠谈判的进行，另一方面又进行绝灭人性的细菌战，来希图延长并扩大朝鲜战争，以实现其破坏中华人民共和国和远东的和平安全的侵略阴谋。对于美帝国主义这一无耻阴谋和罪恶行为，中国人民是有决心也必然要将其粉碎的。美帝国主义将不仅不能达到它的罪恶目的，并且必然将要在全世界和平人民正义的愤怒之下，自食其可耻的恶果。
    我现在代表中国人民向全世界人民控诉美国政府这一违反人道、破坏国际公约、在朝鲜使用细菌武器来虐杀和平人民和武装战士的滔天罪行，并号召全世界爱好和平的人民，采取行动，制止美国政府这种疯狂的罪恶行为。中国人民将和全世界人民一道，为制止美国政府这一疯狂罪行而坚决斗争到底。
    一九五二年二月二十四日
