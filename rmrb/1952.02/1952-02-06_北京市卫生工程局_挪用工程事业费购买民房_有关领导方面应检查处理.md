    Beijing Municipal Bureau of Public Health and Engineering
    Misappropriation of Engineering Funds to Purchase Private Housing
    Relevant Leaders Should Investigate and Handle
    To the Editor: The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Public Health and Engineering disregards the interests of the masses, extracts and misappropriates over 2.7 billion yuan in engineering funds, and purchases private housing on a large scale. Relevant leaders should promptly investigate and handle this matter.
    The Beijing Municipal People's Government has repeatedly issued notices to municipal organizations and groups to cease purchasing private housing. However, the Bureau of Public Health and Engineering, disregarding the interests of the masses, knowingly violates this order and has purchased nineteen private properties, spending over 2.7 billion yuan. It is understood that these funds have been misappropriated and extracted from engineering project funds without authorization. Such large-scale purchases of private housing not only harm the interests of the masses but also violate the principle of using funds for their designated purpose. Some of the private housing was purchased by the Bureau of Public Health and Engineering in the names of private individuals. This kind of deception is extremely improper.
    In addition, in December 1950, when various projects had mostly ceased, instead of having engineering personnel conduct surveys, research, and prepare for various projects, the Bureau of Public Health and Engineering used the excuse of "winter leisure" to build a large office building for the bureau. The materials used were leftover from projects and should have been turned over to the treasury at a price, but the Bureau of Public Health and Engineering cleverly claimed that they were using "waste materials." How can such a large, modern building be built with "waste materials"? Later, when someone raised objections, the leaders of the Bureau of Public Health and Engineering, while ostensibly conducting a self-criticism, continued to construct on a large scale and designed a basement under the building. The responsible comrade of the Bureau of Public Health and Engineering nonchalantly said, "I had already prepared the self-criticism when I did this." This is tantamount to treating self-criticism as a joke.
    I would like to bring this illegal activity of the Bureau of Public Health and Engineering to the attention of the relevant leaders for investigation and handling.

    北京市卫生工程局
    挪用工程事业费购买民房
    有关领导方面应检查处理
    编辑同志：北京市卫生工程局漠视群众利益，套取和挪用工程事业费二十七亿多元，大批购买民房，有关领导方面应迅速检查处理。
    北京市人民政府一再告示市内机关团体，停止购买民房。而卫生工程局竟不顾群众利益，明知故犯，先后购买民用房产十九所，共开支二十七亿多元。据了解，这项用费是擅自挪用和套取的工程事业费。像这样大批地购买民房，不但危害了群众利益，而且也违反了专款专用的原则。有些民房，卫生工程局是用私人名义购买的。这种瞒上欺下的手段是极不正当的。
    此外，在一九五零年十二月间，各种工程多已停止，卫生工程局工程人员不去勘测研究、进行各种工程的准备工作，却以“冬闲”为名，为卫生工程局建筑大楼一所。所用材料是工程节余，本应作价交库，但卫生工程局却巧说这是利用“废料”。试问以“废料”何能建成偌大一座近代化的楼房？后来有人提出意见，卫生工程局领导方面却一面检讨，一面仍大兴土木，并设计建筑楼下地下室。卫生工程局负责同志满不在乎地说：“我做这事，早就准备好检讨书了。”这无异视检讨为儿戏。
    我愿把卫生工程局这一违法事件，提请有关领导方面检查处理。
