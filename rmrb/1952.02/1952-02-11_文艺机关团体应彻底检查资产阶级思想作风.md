    Literary and Art Organizations Should Thoroughly Examine Bourgeois Ideological Work Style

    The phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are also prevalent in literary and art organizations in various regions. Some leading literary and art cadres have decadent bourgeois ideological tendencies. Extravagance in work and corruption in personal enjoyment are very serious. The facts that have been preliminarily exposed by local newspapers and readers prove that the views and arguments that literary and art organizations are not departments in charge of money, do not spend much money themselves, and have no problems are wrong and do not conform to the actual situation.

    According to the accusations of staff members of the South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the preliminary self-examination of Ouyang Shan, the main leader of the Federation, the South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has serious waste and disguised corruption. Due to Ouyang Shan's bureaucratic work style, using patriarchal rule to replace ideological leadership, internal democracy cannot be promoted, and criticism and self-criticism cannot be carried out. Most staff members did not dare to raise opinions, allowing the phenomenon of squandering state assets and the bureaucratic work style of the leadership to exist for a long time. According to preliminary estimates, the South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles spent about 1.5 billion yuan in operating expenses in the past two years, of which more than 400 million yuan was wasted. They often held banquets, and Ouyang Shan's personal living expenses also greatly exceeded the regulations. He arbitrarily increased subsidies for cadres, overspending 80 million yuan in two years. The South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles has not seriously organized literary and artistic creation or conducted ideological study for a long time, but is instead engrossed in administrative affairs, banquets, and socializing. Ouyang Shan said in his preliminary reflection: Since entering the city, he has been catching up with the bourgeoisie in life faster than he caught up with the proletariat in Yan'an. This situation should arouse great vigilance among literary and art workers.

    The waste phenomenon in the Nanjing Federation of Literary and Art Circles is also serious. In just eight months, they hosted guests 59 times, spending a total of 22.66 million yuan. The second annual meeting cost 25.8176 million yuan, much of which was spent on eating and drinking. The Nanjing Cultural Troupe once took over a farm. The members occasionally went to the countryside to water and catch insects, taking cars to and from, and having a big meal when they returned, with the cost far exceeding their "labor" income. Once, when they went to harvest wheat, everyone wore new, wide-brimmed straw hats, carried mats for napping, and brought a large number of meat buns, salted eggs, and soda to eat and drink. After returning to the city, they felt they had "worked hard" for a day and needed "consolation," so after taking a bath and eating a hearty dinner, they went to see a movie. Li Shiyi, the head of the Cultural Troupe, and some members of the troupe took cars to the countryside to "experience life," but they could not get used to the rural food and had their own private kitchen. When the head of the troupe, Li Shiyi, and some members of the troupe returned from visiting land reform, a special welcoming ceremony was held. When Li Shiyi and others arrived at the gate, the originally closed gate suddenly opened wide, firecrackers were set off, military music played, and the acting head of the troupe led the members in a line to welcome them, cheering and applauding for a long time. When Li Shiyi was transferred to another job, the Cultural Troupe held a grand banquet to send him off, with drunken revelry and dancing. Some people even vomited blood from drinking, and some female comrades also cried from drunkenness. This decadent bourgeois ideological work style of the Nanjing Cultural Troupe also existed in their performance work: pursuing luxurious scenes and playing with novel scenery. When they were building the Nanjing Auditorium Theater, they repeatedly added to the budget, from 580 million yuan to more than 27.4 billion yuan, striving for a magnificent building, regardless of the massive waste of state property. Some people even believed that this approach was the "premature realization of socialism," which is absurd!

    It should be pointed out that this decadent and vulgar atmosphere and serious extravagance and waste are by no means limited to the above-mentioned units, but exist more or less universally in many literary and art organizations. In literary and art organizations where this phenomenon exists, there can be no talk of literary and artistic ideological leadership, or serious creation and study. This phenomenon is intolerable. Like other departments, the literary and art circles must, in this great struggle to counter the rampant attacks of bourgeois ideology, ruthlessly expose those ugly facts, thoroughly rectify their ranks, and remove those corrupt and degenerate elements in the literary and art circles who have serious offenses and refuse to repent.

    文艺机关团体应彻底检查资产阶级思想作风
    贪污、浪费、官僚主义的现象在各地文艺机关团体中，也是普遍地存在着。一部分文艺领导干部具有腐朽的资产阶级的思想倾向。在工作中铺张浪费，在个人生活上的享受腐化是十分严重的。据各地报纸和读者已经初步揭发的事实，证明了认为文艺机关团体，不是管钱的部门，自己用钱不多，没有什么问题的看法和论调是错误的，是不符合实际情形的。
    据华南文学艺术界联合会工作人员的检举和文联主要领导人欧阳山的初步自我检查，证明华南文联存在着严重的浪费和变相的贪污现象。由于欧阳山的官僚主义作风，用家长式的统治代替思想领导，致使内部民主不能发扬，批评和自我批评不能展开。多数工作人员有意见也不敢提，听任挥霍浪费国家资财的现象和领导方面的官僚主义作风长期存在。据初步估计，华南文联两年来用去事业费约十五亿元，其中四亿多元是属于浪费的。他们经常举行宴会，欧阳山个人生活费用也大大地超出制度。他擅自对干部增发补贴米，两年共超支八千万元。华南文联长期没有认真组织文艺创作和认真进行思想学习，而是醉心于行政事务、宴饮交际。欧阳山在初步反省中说：他进城以来，在生活上向资产阶级看齐，比在延安时向无产阶级看齐的速度还要快。这种情况应该引起文艺工作者的极大警惕。
    南京文联的浪费现象也是严重的。仅仅八个月的统计，请客达五十九次，共花了二千二百六十六万元。二届年会化了二千五百八十一万七千六百元，其中许多钱是化在吃喝上的。南京文工团曾接管一片农场，团员偶尔下乡浇水捕虫，来去都乘汽车，回来还要大吃一顿，耗费大大超过了他们的“劳动”所得。有一次去收割麦子，大家戴着新的宽边大草帽，夹着准备午睡用的凉席，携带了大批肉包子、咸蛋、汽水去吃喝。返城以后，认为“辛苦”一天，必需“慰劳”，于是洗过澡，吃过丰盛晚餐后，再去看一场电影。文工团团长李世仪等坐着小汽车下乡“体验生活”，但吃不来乡下伙食，另外自己搞小灶。团长李世仪和一部分文工团员参观土地改革回来时，特别举行了欢迎仪式。当李世仪等到达大门时，原来紧闭的大门豁然大开，鞭炮齐鸣，军乐大作，代理团长率领团员列队迎迓，欢呼鼓掌，历久不息。李世仪调动工作时，文工团举行盛大酒会欢送，大醉狂舞，有人竟喝到吐血，有的女同志也醉得哭泣起来。南京文工团的这种腐朽的资产阶级思想作风同样也存在在演出工作中：追求豪华场面，玩弄新奇布景。他们在修建南京会堂剧院时，曾数次追加预算，从五亿八千万元增加到二十七亿四千多万元，务求建筑的富丽堂皇，不顾国家财产的大量浪费。有些人竟认为这样做法是“社会主义的提前实现”，这是何等的荒谬！
    应该指出，这种腐朽庸俗的风气和严重的铺张浪费现象决不止在上述单位中存在，而是或多或少地普遍存在于许多文艺机关团体中。存在着这种现象的文艺机关团体中，当然谈不到什么文艺思想领导，谈不到认真的创作和学习。这种现象是不可容忍的。如同其他部门一样，文艺界必须在这次反击资产阶级思想猖狂进攻的伟大斗争中，无情地揭露那些丑恶事实，彻底整顿自己的队伍，对于那些情节严重而又不肯悔改的文艺界的腐化堕落分子，应该把他们从文艺界清除出去。
