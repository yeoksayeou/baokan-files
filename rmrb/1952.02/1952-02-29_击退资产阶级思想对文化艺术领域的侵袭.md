    Repelling the Intrusion of Bourgeois Ideology into the Realm of Culture and Art

    Not long ago, this newspaper criticized Ouyang Shan, Chairman of the South China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, for his bureaucratic work style. Today, this newspaper exposes Huang Yuan, the Second Deputy Minister of the East China Cultural Department, for his bureaucratic work style and the resulting evil consequences. Their bureaucratic manifestations seem somewhat different: Ouyang Shan desperately grabs money and expands operations, thinking that the more operations, the better; while Huang Yuan regards cultural and artistic undertakings as a "burden," trying to shirk responsibility as much as possible, believing that "the fewer burdens, the better." But in essence, they are the same. That is: treating the important tasks entrusted to them by the Party and the people with an extremely decadent personal-interest perspective and a vulgar, pragmatic attitude. And they are completely the same in their enthusiasm for extravagance and waste, and lavish squandering of state assets.

    Under such bureaucratic and patriarchal leadership, some cadres will inevitably develop bad ideological styles, even to the point of muddling the waters and embezzling from it. As discovered in this inspection, Huang Yuan, based solely on "political guarantees," subsidized 1,000 units of "mass literature and art" every month, which was not necessary. This money was deposited in the bank under the private name of Ke Lan, the editor-in-chief of the publication, who misappropriated it privately and casually, with obvious uncleanliness. Because he feared the East China Cultural Department's auditing, he asked others to create false accounts for him. Ke Lan's behavior, as well as the bad thoughts and bad styles of Zhong Lin, Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the East China Cultural Department, and Yi Bing, Deputy Director of the Art Affairs Management Department of the same department, can exist for a long time, which is inseparable from Huang Yuan's bureaucratic work style.

    Under the shroud of bureaucracy, unprincipled factional disputes will inevitably arise, causing the serious ideological struggle, which is indispensable for promoting the progress of literary and artistic work, to be submerged in the petty infighting of small circles or the vulgar atmosphere of so-called "face" and "friendship." According to the "Literary Gazette," "Worker Literature and Art," edited by the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and "Jiangxi Literature and Art," edited by the Jiangxi Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, often proceeded from so-called "face" and "friendship" when handling manuscripts. Literary and artistic groups in Taiyuan mutually excluded, slandered, and attacked each other; certain literary and artistic leaders had personal prejudices, "laughed" when they met, spoke ill of each other behind their backs, and even cursed. In Shanghai's literary and art circles, this phenomenon is also very serious among some literary and artistic workers. For example, the Shanghai Poetry Association is divided into small circles, engaging in unprincipled disputes, or replacing ideological criticism and ideological struggle with vulgar mutual flattery. This bad habit is like a poisonous bacterium, infringing on our literary and artistic combat organizations. If it is not thoroughly eradicated, our literary and artistic combat organizations will fall into paralysis, and the ideological leadership of the working class on the literary and artistic front will be shaken and usurped by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas.

    The above examples tell us once again what serious evil consequences have been caused by bureaucratic leadership in cultural and artistic organizations. These are clear examples of the corrosive bourgeois ideology invading the realm of culture and art. These phenomena are not allowed to continue to exist. Cultural and artistic organs and groups in various regions should currently concentrate all their efforts on launching a struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. After winning a complete victory in the anti-corruption struggle, they should immediately combine it with literary and artistic rectification and turn to a more universal and in-depth struggle to expose and criticize bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas in literary and artistic work; thoroughly eliminate corruption and waste that corrode cultural and artistic organizations, bureaucracy that seriously damages cultural and artistic undertakings, and all non-working-class ideological styles from the realm of culture and art!

    击退资产阶级思想对文化艺术领域的侵袭
    不久以前，本报批评了华南文学艺术界联合会主席欧阳山的官僚主义作风，今天本报又揭发了华东文化部第二副部长黄源的官僚主义作风，及其所造成的恶果。他们的官僚主义的表现似乎有些不同：欧阳山是拚命地抓钱、抓摊子，以为摊子越多越好；而黄源却把文化艺术事业当作一种“包袱”，尽量推脱不管，“少背一个好一个”。但实质上却是一样的。那就是：以极其腐朽的从个人打算的观点和庸俗的事务主义态度来对待党和人民交给他们的重大任务。而在热中于铺张浪费、大量挥霍国家资财上，他们也是完全一样的。
    在这种官僚主义和家长式的领导下，必然会使个别干部滋长恶劣的思想作风，甚至发展到混水摸鱼，从中贪污。从这次检查中发现，黄源只凭“政治担保”，每月补助“群众文艺”的一千个单位是并非必需的，这笔款子被该刊主编柯蓝，用私人名义存入银行，私自随便挪用，其中显有不干净的地方。他因怕华东文化部查账，曾让别人给他造假账。柯蓝的这种行为，以及华东文化部秘书处副处长钟林和该部艺术事业管理处副处长伊兵的坏思想、坏作风能够长期存在，是和黄源的官僚主义作风分不开的。
    在官僚主义作风笼罩下，又必然会产生无原则的宗派纠纷。使推动文艺工作前进的、不可缺少的、严肃的思想斗争，淹没在小圈子的勾心斗角或所谓 “面子”“友情”的庸俗气氛中。据“文艺报”报道，武汉市文联主编的“工人文艺”和江西省文联主编的“江西文艺”，在处理稿件时，常常是从所谓“面子”“友情”出发的。太原文艺团体之间互相排挤，互相诽谤和攻击；某些文艺领导干部之间闹私人成见，见面“打哈哈”，背后乱讲，甚至谩骂。上海文艺界，某些文艺工作者中，此种现象也很严重。如上海诗歌联谊会就分成一些小圈子，闹无原则纠纷，或以庸俗的互相吹嘘来代替思想批判和思想斗争。这种恶劣的习气像毒菌一样侵害着我们的文艺战斗组织，如不彻底加以肃清，我们的文艺战斗组织就会陷于麻痹和瘫痪，文艺战线上工人阶级的思想领导就会发生动摇，就会被资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想所篡夺。
    以上这些事例，再一次告诉我们，在文化艺术组织中，由于官僚主义的领导，造成了何等严重的恶果。这是腐朽的资产阶级思想侵蚀文化艺术领域的显明的例子。这些现象是不允许它们继续存在下去的。各地文化艺术机关团体，目前应集中全力展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，在反贪污斗争获得全胜后，应该立即结合文艺整风，转入更普遍、更深入地揭发和批判文艺工作中的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的斗争；把腐蚀文化艺术组织的贪污浪费现象，和严重损害文化艺术事业的官僚主义，以及一切非工人阶级的思想作风，从文化艺术领域中彻底肃清！
