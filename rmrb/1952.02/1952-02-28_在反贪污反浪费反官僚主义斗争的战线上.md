On the Front Lines of the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucratism

　　Nanjing leniently treats confessed and repentant industrial and commercial households, arrests several major merchants who refuse to confess.

　　On the 17th, industrial and commercial circles in Nanjing held separate confession and exposure meetings in various industries. At these meetings, participants exposed the crimes of Zhou Ruifang, manager of Peihe Pharmaceutical Factory, for manufacturing fake drugs; Chen Shaochuan, manager of Yongcheng Timber Firm, for intoxicating cadres with alcohol and stealing over 200 million yuan of state assets; Liu Wengui, a speculative profiteer from Meifeng Photographic Materials, for engaging in speculation and tax evasion; and Liu Yizhou, manager of Huizhong Construction Factory, for cutting corners in the construction of the dam protection project on the banks of Danyang Lake in southern Anhui, causing the dam to collapse within three months of completion, endangering over 300,000 mu of farmland and the property of hundreds of thousands of people. These merchants committed serious crimes and refused to confess, and were arrested on the spot by the People's Government.

　　At the confession and exposure meetings in various industries, the municipal People's Government leniently treated those illegal industrial and commercial households who confessed well and made contributions through exposure, and instructed them to strive for meritorious service to atone for their crimes.

　　Shenyang handles a batch of illegal industrial and commercial households separately

　　The Shenyang Municipal People's Government arrested sixteen extremely wicked merchants who refused to confess on the 15th and announced that eighty illegal industrial and commercial operators who had confessed relatively thoroughly would be exempted from legal punishment.

　　Among the sixteen major thieves arrested, some were unscrupulous grain and oil merchants who stole large quantities of state property by passing off bad rice as good, affecting the people's livelihood, such as Du Xiangpu, general manager of Gongxingda Rice Mill. Others were agents and transportation industry merchants who engaged in speculation through "running contracts" and "buying and selling short," such as Jin Xiushan, manager of Qianyi Transportation Company. Some were timber industry merchants who stole important state materials, seriously affecting economic construction, such as Li Jingyu, manager of Gonghe Electric Saw Timber Factory. Still others were electrical and hardware material merchants who stole large quantities of property when processing for state organs or having other transactional relationships, such as Yu Zhimin, manager of Shengli Electrical Company. These major thieves not only resisted confession during this campaign but also used shameless means such as threatening employees to prevent them from reporting and forming "defensive alliances" to sabotage the movement.

　　While arresting sixteen major thieves, the Shenyang Municipal People's Government decided to exempt eighty illegal industrial and commercial operators who had confessed relatively thoroughly from legal punishment, only pursuing the recovery of the state assets they had stolen and the taxes they had evaded in 1951.

　　Guizhou Commercial Department organizes special “shock teams” to concentrate firepower and break through the strongholds of major corrupt officials

　　The Commercial Department of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government and the state-owned specialized companies under its leadership have recently organized special personnel or "shock teams" to lead the masses, conscientiously conduct investigation and research, and break through the stubborn strongholds of major corrupt officials. This experience has been widely promoted in all units throughout the province. These "shock teams" are all personally directed by the heads of their respective units. Each "shock team" focuses on collecting comprehensive information, researching, talking, and mobilizing family members, etc., grasping the key points and repeatedly concentrating firepower to attack a single target, leaving major corrupt officials with nowhere to hide. For example, Zhou Wenhui, a major corrupt official of the department store, refused to confess further after admitting to embezzling 8 million yuan. To break Zhou Wenhui's stubborn resistance, the Zhou Wenhui "shock team," composed of six activists, collected hundreds of pieces of material from inside and outside and took turns constantly conducting individual talks with Zhou Wenhui on issues and mobilizing Zhou's wife to educate him. Finally, Zhou Wenhui had to admit to the crime of embezzling 400.8 million yuan.

　　The Trade Union of Central Railway Ministry mobilizes family members of staff to report

　　The Trade Union of the Central People's Government Railway Ministry has mobilized the family members of staff to participate in the anti-corruption struggle and has achieved good results. The union held a meeting of family members of the ministry staff to publicize the policies of the People's Government, and the various units within the ministry held separate forums. Some units even organized female staff members into home visit groups to explain the policies of the People's Government to the family members of the staff. After further understanding the policies, many family members actively helped the leadership understand the situation and persuaded their relatives to thoroughly confess their embezzlement facts to the government. Cao Yongfu, deputy section chief of the procurement section of the Tianjin Materials Supply Office of the Materials Bureau of the Central Railway Ministry, was a major corrupt element. Under the persuasion of his wife and son, he confessed to embezzling over 170 million yuan and reported the corrupt elements involved with him. Sun Peiyao, a purchaser from the Health Bureau of the Central Railway Ministry, and Zheng Jikui, a corrupt element from the Life Supply Department of the Central Railway Ministry, confessed their crimes after being mobilized by their families.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    南京宽大处理坦白悔过工商户逮捕拒不坦白的大奸商多名
    南京市工商界各行业十七日曾分别举行坦白检举大会。在各行业的坦白检举大会上，大家分别检举了培和药厂经理周瑞芳制造假药；永成木行经理陈绍川用酒灌醉干部，盗窃国家资财二亿多元；美丰照相材料行奸商刘文贵投机倒把大量逃税；汇中营造厂经理刘一舟在包做皖南丹阳湖畔的护堤工程中偷工减料，致使该堤修好不到三个月就被水冲垮，危及三十多万亩农田和数十万人民的财产的罪行。这些奸商罪恶重大而又拒不坦白，都被人民政府当场逮捕。
    在各行业的坦白检举大会上，坦白较好并能检举立功的不法工商业户，市人民政府都予以从宽处理，并要他们争取立功赎罪。
    沈阳分别处理一批违法工商户
    沈阳市人民政府在十五日逮捕了十六名罪大恶极、拒不坦白的奸商，同时宣布对八十户坦白比较彻底的违法工商业者免予法律处分。
    被逮捕的十六个大盗窃犯中，有的是丧尽天良，以坏米充好米，大量盗窃国家财产，影响人民生活的米油业奸商，如公兴达制米厂总经理杜香圃等。有的是以“跑合对缝”、“买空卖空”的手段进行投机倒把活动的代理店业和运输业的奸商，如谦益运输行经理金秀山等。有的是盗窃国家重要物资，严重影响经济建设的木材业的奸商，如公和电锯木厂经理李静宇等。有的是为国家机关加工或有其他交易关系时大量盗窃财物的电器材料业和五金材料业的奸商，如胜利电社经理虞治民等。上述各大盗窃犯在这次运动中，不仅抗拒坦白，并以威胁职工检举、订立“攻守同盟”种种无耻手段破坏运动。
    与逮捕十六名大盗窃犯的同时，沈阳市人民政府对坦白比较彻底的八十户违法工商业者决定免予法律处分，只追缴其所偷盗的国家资财和一九五一年偷漏的税款。
    贵州商业厅组织专案“突击队”集中火力突破大贪污犯的堡垒
    贵州省人民政府商业厅和所领导的各国营专业公司，最近组织专人或专案的“突击队”，带领群众，认真进行调查研究工作，突破了大贪污犯的顽固堡垒。这一经验已在全省各单位中广泛推行。这些“突击队”都由各单位首长亲自指挥作战。每个“突击队”都抓紧收集全面资料、研究、谈话和发动家属等工作，抓住要害，反复不断地集中火力向着一个目标进攻，使大贪污犯无处躲藏。如百货公司大贪污犯周文辉在承认贪污八百万元以后就拒不坦白。为打破周文辉的顽抗，由六个积极分子组成的周文辉“突击队”，从内外收集了几百件材料，并轮流不断地按问题找周文辉进行个别谈话和动员周的妻子教育他。最后周文辉不得不承认贪污四亿零八百万元的罪行。
    中央铁道部机关工会发动工作人员家属检举
    中央人民政府铁道部机关工会发动工作人员家属参加反贪污斗争，已收到很好效果。该会召开机关工作人员家属大会，宣传人民政府的政策，并由部内各单位分别召开座谈会。有些单位的女工作人员还组织了家庭访问小组，向本机关工作人员的家属讲解人民政府的政策。许多家属在进一步了解政策后，纷纷帮助领导方面了解情况，规劝自己的亲属向政府彻底坦白贪污事实。中央铁道部材料局天津材料供应处采购科副科长曹永福是个大贪污分子，就在他的妻子和儿子的规劝下，坦白了自己贪污一亿七千多万元的事实，并检举了和他有关的贪污分子。中央铁道部卫生局采购员孙培尧、中央铁道部生活供应处贪污分子郑计奎都在家属动员下，坦白了自己的罪行。
