Our Great Motherland

    Fishermen on both sides of the Songhua River in Northeast China, with the help of the People's Government, have seen their lives gradually improve. In winter, in addition to engaging in some sideline production, they also break the ice on the Songhua River to fish. This is a group of fishermen from Meichang Village in the suburbs of Harbin. They are opening cracks in the ice on the river, preparing to cast their nets and fish.
