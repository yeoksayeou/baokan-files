    Korean Vocational Trade Union League and Korean Red Cross, etc.
    Vehemently Denounce the Crime of American Aggressors Spreading Bacteria
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 25th] All levels of the Korean Vocational Trade Union League and the Korean Red Cross have unanimously and solemnly denounced and strongly protested the heinous crime of the American aggressors spreading large quantities of bacteria-carrying insects in the front and rear of Korea.
    Chairman Hyun Heun of the Korean Vocational Trade Union League, in his speech, sternly pointed out: At the time of the armistice negotiations, the American aggressors once again committed such an inhumane atrocity in Korea. This shows that the aggressors' intentions after being forced to accept the armistice negotiations are absolutely not to peacefully resolve the Korean issue, but to attempt to use all kinds of shameless atrocities to delay or even disrupt the negotiations in order to prepare for expanding their aggression. However, the sinister schemes of the American imperialists cannot be realized. It can only further arouse the hatred and anger of the people of Korea and China, as well as peace-loving people all over the world. Hyun Heun said: We, the entire Korean working class, strongly protest against the aggressors' extremely barbaric atrocities and call on all Korean people to give the heinous enemy an even heavier blow with practical actions.
    Chairman Lee Dong-young of the Central Committee of the Korean Red Cross said: Our Korean Red Cross resolutely protests against the aggressors' crime of openly trampling on international law and being utterly inhuman, and demands just sanctions from the people of the world. At the same time, we will resolutely strengthen our epidemic prevention work and will never allow the enemy's poisonous schemes to succeed.
    Kim Byung-hong, chairman of the Pyongyang City Committee of the Korean Red Cross, also protested, saying: American imperialism, which attempts to dominate the world, will resort to any means to realize its aggressive ambitions. Its atrocities of妄想滅絕(妄想滅絕 is in Chinese and the rest is not) trying to exterminate the Korean people will inevitably be denounced and sanctioned by the Korean people and peace-loving people all over the world. We resolutely demand that the criminals engaged in bacteriological warfare be severely sanctioned internationally.

    朝鲜职业总同盟和朝鲜红十字会等
    痛斥美国侵略者撒布细菌的罪行
    【新华社平壤二十五日电】朝鲜职业总同盟和朝鲜红十字会各级机构一致严正痛斥并强烈抗议美国侵略者在朝鲜前后方大量撒布细菌毒虫的万恶罪行。
    朝鲜职业总同盟委员长玄勋在谈话中严词指出：在进行停战谈判的时候，美国侵略者又一次在朝鲜制造这种丧尽人性的暴行，这表明侵略者在被迫接受停战谈判后的居心绝对不是为了和平解决朝鲜问题，而是企图利用种种无耻暴行拖延甚至破坏谈判，以进行扩大侵略的准备。但是，美帝国主义者的险恶阴谋是无法实现的。它只能进一步激起朝中两国人民以及全世界爱好和平人民的敌忾与愤怒。玄勋说：我们全朝鲜的工人阶级强烈抗议侵略者这种野蛮到极点的暴行，号召全朝鲜人民以实际行动给予万恶的敌人以更加沉重的打击。
    朝鲜红十字会中央委员会委员长李东英说：我们朝鲜红十字会坚决抗议侵略者这种公然蹂躏国际公法和毫无人道的罪行，要求全世界人民予以正义的制裁。同时我们坚决加强我们的防疫工作，绝不容许敌人的毒计得逞。
    朝鲜红十字会平壤市委员会委员长金炳弘也抗议说：企图称霸世界的美帝国主义，为了实现其侵略野心是不择手段的。它这种妄想灭绝朝鲜人民的暴行，必然会受到朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平人民的痛斥和制裁。我们坚决要求给予从事细菌战争的罪犯以严厉的国际制裁。
