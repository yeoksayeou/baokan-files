The staff of the state-owned Beijing Dahua Cinema bravely encircled and suppressed Qi Zhenbo, the manager and major embezzler of the cinema, and achieved victory. Qi has been arrested and brought to justice.

Qi Zhenbo was the Deputy Director of the Film Section of the Political Department of the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and concurrently the manager of the Beijing Dahua Cinema under the North China Military Region. This major embezzler had already been arrested and surrendered to the enemy in 1941 during the Japanese "mopping-up operations," betraying the Party and the people. Soon after, he falsely claimed to have been "bailed out" and infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, then entered the Party in the original Jizhong Frontline Drama Society. After taking over as manager of Dahua Cinema in October 1949, due to his vile character and seeing an opportunity, he colluded with accountant Zhao Minghua to embezzle large sums. In two years, he embezzled film rental fees, rental fees, and proceeds from the sale of public property totaling over 126.69 million yuan. He used this huge sum of embezzled money to buy land and vehicles in his hometown of Lixian County, Hebei Province. He also had close dealings with private merchant Zhang Baozhi, jointly opening "Xinlong Silk and Cloth Shop" in Beijing. He also personally went to Shanghai to traffic in black light bulbs for film projectors, engaging in speculation and profiteering. For two years, Qi Zhenbo used cunning methods to conceal his misdeeds, pretending to be active to superiors and bullying and intimidating subordinates; he often threatened to "dismiss" or "fire" employees who saw through his embezzlement. In addition, he used various means to obstruct the activities of the trade union. On the one hand, the employees were suffocated by his oppression, and on the other hand, because the superior leadership departments had serious bureaucratic styles and did not go deep into the masses, they had to suppress their resentment. Some employees, although unable to bear Qi's embezzlement, dared not speak publicly, but secretly recorded the facts of Qi's embezzlement. Many employees also constantly collected clues about his embezzlement. Everyone believed that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, "there will always be a day of liberation."

After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, Qi Zhenbo evasively adopted a passive resistance attitude. On January 2nd, when Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the North China Military Region, gave a mobilization report in the North China Military Region, Qi even used the excuse of contacting the China Film Corporation to bring his wife to the Beijing Theater to see a song and dance performance. At the all-cinema staff meeting, he confused everyone by saying, "We have no corruption, at most a little waste. I have been 'rectified' and 'three-checked,' passed through a sieve and a riddle, how can there still be corruption?" He also threatened everyone: opinions must be based on evidence, and there must be no nonsense or random suspicion. Fan Zhelong, the secretary and Party group leader of Dahua Cinema, refuted Qi's fallacy on the spot. However, because the employees were afraid of retaliation and dismissal, they dared not speak. The Party organization then held joint meetings of Party and Youth League members for several consecutive days to study and analyze the ideological situation of the employees, repeatedly conveying the determination of the higher authorities to carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle, and offering guarantees. On the 7th, Ding Li, Deputy Minister of the Culture Department of the North China Military Region, personally went to lead the struggle, gave a mobilization report at Dahua Cinema, and participated in group discussions, greatly inspiring the enthusiasm and courage of the more than 30 employees of the cinema. Li Jinde, a worker who had always had many concerns, said excitedly, "In the past, I wouldn't have believed it even if you brought six trains of Marxism-Leninism, but this time I believe the Communist Party. I have seen the sunny sky!"

The employees saw the determination of the higher authorities and Chairman Mao, and the spearhead of the struggle immediately focused on Qi. Many employees voluntarily went out to investigate secretly. Worker Zhao Weijian (Youth League member) found out that Qi had invested in "Xinlong Silk and Cloth Shop" and deposited more than 55 million yuan in the name of his wife, Su Wanrong. Under the leadership of Fan Zhelong, all the employees elected five people to form an investigation team. The work of three people in the cinema was taken over by two people, freeing up people to investigate. The personnel remaining in the cinema divided the work to monitor Qi's activities and pay attention to the guests who came into contact with him, laying a tight net inside and out. Everyone put forward the combat slogan: Persist in screening work, and also catch the "tiger."

The employees displayed a high degree of wisdom and investigated from many aspects. The investigators often returned late at night. They reported the situation to everyone that night and jointly studied and analyzed it; when they discovered new clues, they tracked them down. In less than ten days, they found more than ten shops, construction factories, electrical shops, food shops, and car shops, either related to Qi's embezzlement or raised the situation of Qi's squandering and wasting state resources after stealing them. Yang Tai, the director of cinema affairs, also took out his small account book of Dahua Cinema's rental fees, which he had secretly recorded for a whole year, and the receipts for film rental fees that he had collected for four months.

The employees felt that catching the "tiger" required casting a wide net, and that relying solely on outside investigations was not enough, so they mobilized the families of the employees to participate in the battle. The mother of Jin Chonglin, a nanny serving in Qi's home, provided the fact that Qi had sent a large amount of stolen money back to his hometown of Lixian County, Hebei, bought two acres of land, a car, and bought more than four million yuan of prize-winning savings bonds. The wife of worker Wu Wenyuan found the situation of preparing to steal and burn receipts from the home of accountant Zhao Minghua, who had embezzled with Qi. The family members reported the information they learned to the investigation team in a timely manner, providing more conclusive evidence of Qi's embezzlement.

Seeing that the spearhead of the struggle was pointing at him and that his threats were ineffective, Qi Zhenbo became somewhat uneasy. He then instructed Zhao Minghua to quickly burn all the receipts. In order to win over the employees, he took out 14 million yuan that he had embezzled in the name of "employee welfare" in the past and asked the trade union cadres to hand it over to the "small store" established by the workers' collective shares. At the same time, Qi said to Fan Zhelong, the secretary leading the movement, "You look quite cold, buy a coat!" He also took out a picture of a woman and said he wanted to introduce a lover to Fan Zhelong. But Qi's tricks were exposed by Fan Zhelong and the employees.

After many days of investigation by the employees, the facts of Qi's embezzlement were fully collected. On January 9th, the entire cinema staff held an exposure meeting, presenting Qi's embezzlement facts to him one by one. These conclusive evidences forced Qi to admit his embezzlement. The Military Law Department of the North China Military Region arrested Qi Zhenbo in accordance with the law that night. Seeing the victorious results of their struggle, the employees forgot the fatigue of running around for days, and smiles appeared on their faces. They proposed to write a letter to Chairman Mao, thanking him for his wise leadership and telling him that without the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, the workers would not know when they could "turn over."

On January 21st, the Political Department of the North China Military Region convened a meeting attended by more than 800 cadres to struggle against the major embezzler Qi Zhenbo. At the meeting, Zhang Zhixiang, Deputy Director of the Political Department, announced the decision of the Party Committee: to expel Qi Zhenbo, the major embezzler who refused to confess, from the Party. He also announced the removal of Qi Zhenbo's position and handed him over to the Military Law Department for severe punishment. At the same time, he praised the meritorious service of the entire staff of "Dahua" in bravely encircling and suppressing the major embezzler. He called on everyone to learn from the staff of Dahua Cinema and concentrate their firepower to attack major embezzlers.

    北京大华电影院经理贪污犯齐振波落网记
    孙世恺
    公营北京大华电影院全体职工，奋勇围剿本院经理、大贪污犯齐振波，获得胜利。齐犯已被逮捕法办。
    齐振波是人民解放军华北军区政治部电影科副科长兼华北军区所属北京大华电影院经理。这个大贪污犯远在一九四一年日寇“扫荡”时，即被捕变节自首，叛变了党和人民。不久伪称被“保释”，钻入革命阵营，又在原冀中火线剧社混进党内。一九四九年十月接任大华电影院经理后，由于他品质恶劣，看到有机可乘，便拉着会计赵明华，大肆贪污。二年来，贪污灯片费、包场费和盗卖公物所得共达一亿二千六百六十九万多元。他用这笔贪污巨款，在其原籍河北省蠡县置买田地、车辆。平时和私商张宝治交往甚密，在北京合伙开设“新隆绸布庄”。并亲自去上海贩运电影机用的黑头灯泡，投机倒把，牟取暴利。齐振波二年来用狡猾的手段，掩饰他的恶迹，对上假装积极，对职工则吹胡瞪眼，作威作福；对看出他贪污马脚的职工更经常用“开除”、“辞退”相威胁。此外还用种种手段阻挠工会的活动。职工们一方面被他压制得透不过气来，一方面又因为上级领导部门有严重的官僚主义作风，不深入群众，不得不把愤恨压在肚子里。有的职工虽然看不下齐犯的贪污行为，但不敢公开讲，只暗地记下齐犯贪污的事实。很多职工也不断地搜集他的贪污行为的线索。大家相信：在毛主席和共产党领导下，“总有解放的日子”。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，齐振波躲躲闪闪地抱着消极抵抗的态度。一月二日，华北军区政治部副主任张致祥在华北军区作动员报告时，齐犯竟以去中国影片公司联络影片为名，带着他的老婆到北京剧场看歌舞晚会。在全院职工大会上，他迷惑大家说：“我们没有贪污，顶多有点浪费。我个人经过‘整风’、‘三查’，过了筛子又过了箩，怎么还会有贪污？”并威胁大家：提意见要有根据，不能胡说乱怀疑。大华电影院秘书兼党的小组长范哲龙，当场反驳了齐的谬论。但职工们因怕报复、怕解雇，都不敢发言。党的组织便连日召开党、团员联席会议，研究分析职工思想情况，针对群众思想顾虑，反复地传达上级关于开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的决心，并提出保证。七日，华北军区文化部副部长丁里亲去领导斗争，到大华电影院作动员报告，并参加小组讨论会，大大激发了全院三十多名职工斗争的热情和勇气。一向顾虑较多的工人李进德，兴奋地说：“过去就是拉六列车马列主义来我也不相信，这回我可相信共产党了。见了晴天啦！”
    职工们看到了上级的决心、毛主席的决心，斗争的锋芒立即集中到齐犯身上。许多职工自动出外暗地调查。工人赵维俭（青年团员）查出齐犯以他妻子苏婉荣的名义，在“新隆绸布庄”入股和存款五千五百多万元。全体职工在范哲龙领导下，推选出五人，组成了调查小组。院里三个人的工作由两个人担当起来，腾出人去调查。留院的人员，分工监视齐犯的活动，并注意和他来往的客人，里里外外，布下了严密的天罗地网。大家提出战斗的口号：坚持放映工作，还要捉住“老虎”。
    职工们发挥了高度智慧，多方面去调查。调查的人每每深更半夜才回来。当晚向大家汇报情况，共同研究分析；发现新的线索，就跟踪追究。不到十天，查出十多家商店、营造厂、电料行、食品店、车行，或则和齐犯贪污事实有关，或则提出齐犯盗窃国家资财后的挥霍浪费情况。院务主任杨泰也拿出他暗记了一整年的大华电影院包场费的小账本，和收集到的四个月来灯片费的单据。
    职工们觉得捉“虎”要网张八面，光靠出外调查还不够，就把职工家属也动员起来参加战斗。在齐犯家当褓姆的服务员金崇林的母亲，提供了齐犯寄回老家河北蠡县大批赃款，买了二亩地、一辆车，并买了四百多万元的有奖储蓄券的事实。工人武文元的老婆，从和齐犯共同贪污的会计赵明华家里，发现了准备偷烧单据的情况。家属们把了解到的情况及时汇报给调查小组，使齐犯的贪污罪行有了更确凿的证据。
    齐振波看到斗争的锋芒指向自己，行使威胁手段无效，心神有些不安。遂指使赵明华赶快把全部单据烧掉。他为了收买职工，把过去以“职工福利”名义贪污下来的一千四百万元拿出来，要工会干部交给工人集股成立的“小卖部”。同时，齐犯又对领导运动的秘书范哲龙说：“看你挺冷的，买件大衣吧！”他还拿出一张女人的像片，说要给范哲龙介绍爱人。但齐犯的这些鬼把戏，都被范哲龙和职工们揭穿了。
    经过职工们多天的调查，齐犯贪污的犯罪事实收集齐全了。一月九日全院职工举行检举大会，把齐犯一笔一笔的贪污事实都摆在他的面前，这些真凭实据，逼迫着齐犯不得不承认他的贪污罪行。华北军区军法处在当晚依法把齐振波加以逮捕。职工们看到自己斗争的胜利战果，忘掉了连日奔走的疲劳，面上都浮现出微笑。纷纷提议写信给毛主席，感谢毛主席的英明领导，告诉毛主席要不是有反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，工人们不知啥时才能“翻身”。
    一月二十一日，华北军区政治部召开了有八百多干部参加的斗争大贪污犯齐振波的大会。会上，政治部副主任张致祥，宣布党委会决议：开除死不坦白的大贪污犯齐振波党籍。并宣布撤消齐振波的职务，交军法处严惩。同时表扬了“大华”全体职工英勇围剿大贪污犯的功劳。他号召大家向大华电影院职工学习，集中火力向大贪污分子进攻。
