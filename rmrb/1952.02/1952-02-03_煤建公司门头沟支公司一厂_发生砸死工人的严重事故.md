To the Editor:

A serious accident occurred at the Mentougou Branch Company No. 1 Factory of the China Coal Industry Construction Material Company on January 22nd, resulting in the death of worker Li Wenming, due to the collapse of a coal pile. This was because the leading cadres showed no concern for the safety of the loading and unloading workers. The train coal loading work of this branch company is undertaken by the loading and unloading workers of Mentougou Station. The coal piles at Branch Company No. 1 Factory are as high as fifteen meters and collapse frequently. In the past two years, last year and the year before, a total of fifteen workers have been injured. During this period, Mentougou Station and the Beijing Railway Bureau respectively made suggestions for improvement to the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Coal Industry Construction Material Company and the Mentougou Branch Company, but they were never taken seriously. The station's loading and unloading workers had no choice but to request the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau to handle this issue in early January. On January 8th, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Labor Bureau convened a meeting of the responsible persons of the Beijing Municipal Company of the China Coal Industry Construction Material Company and the Mentougou Branch Company to discuss solutions. This meeting decided that the Mentougou Branch Company should pay attention to maintaining the natural slope of the coal pile and installing lighting equipment, etc. However, they did not follow these regulations. On January 19th, the coal pile at the Mentougou Branch Company No. 1 Factory collapsed again, injuring a worker. On January 22nd, over one hundred tons of coal collapsed from the factory's coal pile, causing the death of worker Li Wenming. For the safety of over six hundred loading and unloading workers at Mentougou Station, I suggest that relevant departments promptly handle this matter.

Editor's Note: The above two letters indicate that the leading cadres of the Donggou Coal Mine and the Mentougou Branch Company No. 1 Factory of the China Coal Industry Construction Material Company have serious bureaucratic work styles. Their neglect of the safety of workers' lives has reached an intolerable level. We suggest that the relevant leading departments of these two units promptly investigate the facts, deal with those derelict in their duties, and make a public self-criticism in the newspaper.

    发生砸死工人的严重事故
    编辑同志：中国煤业建筑器材公司门头沟支公司一厂，由于领导干部毫不关心装卸工人安全，一月二十二日发生煤堆坍下砸死工人李文明的事故。这个支公司的火车装煤工作，是由门头沟车站装卸工人担任的。支公司一厂的煤堆高达十五公尺，经常倒坍，去年和前年两年中，共砸伤十五个工人。在这一期间，门头沟车站和北京铁路分局分别向中国煤业建筑器材公司北京市公司和门头沟支公司提出改善的建议，但始终得不到他们的重视。车站装卸工人没有办法，在一月初请求北京市劳动局处理这个问题。一月八日，北京市工商局、劳动局召集中国煤业建筑器材公司北京市公司、门头沟支公司的负责人，商讨解决问题的办法。这次会议决定门头沟支公司应注意保持煤堆的自然坡度，以及安装照明设备等。但是，他们没有按这些规定做。一月十九日，门头沟支公司一厂煤堆又倒坍，砸伤一个工人。二十二日，一厂的煤堆倒下一百多吨，造成压死工人李文明的事故。为了门头沟车站六百多装卸工人的安全，我建议有关部门迅速处理这件事。

    编者按：以上两封来信，说明洞沟煤矿和中国煤业建筑器材公司门头沟支公司一厂的领导干部，有严重的官僚主义作风。他们对工人生命安全的忽视，已达到使人不能容忍的程度。我们建议这两个单位的有关领导部门，迅即查清事实，处理失职人员，并在报上公开检讨。
