    The Immensely Powerful Soviet Army Inspires Us
    Li Xuesan, Head of the Returning Delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers
    Today, the Chinese people and all peace-loving people of the world, with boundless excitement, join the entire Soviet people in celebrating the thirty-fourth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, the defender of the great Soviet socialist country and the champion of world peace. We, the returning delegates of the Chinese People's Volunteers, with even greater fervor, extend our highest respects to the Soviet Army we admire!
    Facts have proven that the path taken by the Soviet Army over the past thirty-four years is a great, glorious, and victorious path of struggle. This is also the path that our Chinese People's Army must take. The Chinese People's Volunteers are very fortunate to have such an immensely powerful Soviet Army as our role model. We must strive a hundredfold to emulate this just and invincible army, demand of ourselves the same political quality and military skill as the Soviet Army, and learn and develop the Soviet Army's combat experience, especially the Soviet Army's experience in the anti-fascist war.
    In the war against fascism, the Soviet Army displayed a high degree of internationalism and patriotism, making the greatest contribution to the peace and happiness of all mankind. In 1941, German fascism began to attack the Soviet Union. The brutal actions of the German invaders on Soviet territory brought unprecedented disaster to the Soviet people. But the Soviet people and the Soviet Army were not intimidated by this great disaster; they rose up bravely and resolutely to fight. In the four years of the Great Patriotic War, after countless major battles, they annihilated ten million fascist troops, thereby reversing the course of human history and leading the people of the world toward a new era of peace and democracy. On the Korean battlefield, we have once again seen American imperialism treading the old path taken by the fascists, creating all kinds of brutal atrocities. The American invaders are attempting to bring these atrocities to our great motherland, and even to every corner of the world. However, American imperialism has suffered a powerful counterattack from the Chinese and Korean people, and a fate even more disastrous than that of German and Japanese fascism awaits American and British imperialism. Our Volunteers, fighting in Korea, are not only defending our motherland, but also playing a crucial role in maintaining peace in the Far East and the world; this is precisely the behavior expected of the Chinese people, who possess the spirit of internationalism and patriotism.
    The Soviet Army's spirit of internationalism and patriotism has been praised by the people of the world. On the continents of Asia and Europe, people of all countries have erected many monuments to forever commemorate their liberators. These monuments mark the glory of the Soviet Army, the respect and love of the people of all countries for the Soviet people, and the fighting friendship between the people of all countries and the Soviet people. In the parks of Berlin, in Freedom Square in Budapest, on Peony Peak in Pyongyang, and throughout Northeast China, there are these most precious monuments of mankind. These monuments forever engrave the friendship with the Soviet Union in the hearts of the people of all countries. Now, the Korean people have also erected many such structures for our Volunteers, on Iron Blood Mountain, in Hamhung City, and throughout Korea—where the Volunteers shed their blood. This friendship, consolidated with blood and flesh, is equally unbreakable.
    The noble revolutionary heroism of the Soviet Army constantly inspires and motivates us. Countless heroes in the style of Matrosov have emerged in our Volunteers, such as our immortal hero Yang Gensi, Luo Shengjiao, who sacrificed himself to save a drowning Korean boy, and the iron hero Zhang Caishu, who used his wounded body to detonate a landmine, thus opening the way for the troops to charge forward. They were all born under the call of the spirit of revolutionary heroism. We are proud of our people's army for having these Matrosov-style heroes. The outstanding Soviet commanders, like Shaburov in "Day and Night" and Bavurjan in "Fear and Fearlessness," with their arduous struggle, bravery, and resourcefulness, are objects of admiration and models for learning by the commanding personnel of our Volunteers. Increasingly, excellent young commanding personnel like Guo Zhongtian, Zhou Wenjiang, and Cui Jianguo are emerging in our Volunteers today.
    Under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist military thought, we have studied Stalin's military science; we have the ardent support of 475 million people of our motherland. Our weapons and equipment are being strengthened day by day, rapidly catching up with the world's newest, most scientific, and most modern Soviet Army, which is also an important factor in our victory.
    Although we are facing the world's last, most powerful, and most ferocious American imperialism and the armies of its dozen or so accomplices, and although these man-eating barbarians have suffered major defeats but have not yet laid down their weapons, we are confident that we will achieve final victory under the inspiration of the Soviet Army's victory in defeating German fascism and its accomplice armies, and with the support of the people of the world. We firmly believe that all the aggressive conspiracies of the American imperialists will fail. The immensely powerful Soviet Army is the guarantee of human peace and happiness. On this day of celebration of the thirty-fourth anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, we warmly shout long live the Soviet Army!

    强大无比的苏联军队鼓舞着我们
    中国人民志愿军归国代表团团长  李雪三
    今天，中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民，都以无比兴奋的心情，和全苏联人民一道，来庆贺伟大的苏维埃社会主义国家的保卫者、世界和平的捍卫者——苏联军队建军三十四周年纪念。我们中国人民志愿军的归国代表们，更以热烈的心情，向我们所敬仰的苏联军队致以崇高的敬礼！
    事实证明，苏联军队三十四年来，所走过的道路，是伟大的、光荣的、胜利的战斗道路。这也是我们中国人民军队所要走的道路。中国人民志愿军很庆幸我们有着这样一支强大无比的苏联军队作为我们学习的榜样；我们要以百倍的努力向这一支正义的、无坚不摧的军队看齐，以苏军那样的政治质量和军事素养来要求我们自己，学习与发扬苏联军队的战斗经验，特别是苏军反对法西斯战争的经验。
    在反对法西斯的战争中，苏军发挥了高度的国际主义和爱国主义精神，对全人类的和平与幸福作了最伟大的贡献。一九四一年，德国法西斯开始向苏联进攻。德国侵略者在苏联的国土上的残暴行为，给苏联人民带来了空前的灾难。但是苏联人民和苏联军队并没有被这重大的灾难所吓倒，他们英勇顽强的起来战斗了。在四年的卫国战争中，经过无数次的大战，歼灭了一千万法西斯军队，从而扭转了人类的历史，使全世界人民走向和平民主的新时代。我们在朝鲜战场上，又同样地看到了美帝国主义走着当年法西斯所走的老路，制造了各种残酷的暴行。美国侵略者并企图把这种暴行带到我们伟大的祖国来，甚至带到世界的每个角落里。但是，美帝国主义遭受到了中朝人民有力的回击，比德、日法西斯更惨的失败命运将会等待着美英帝国主义。我们志愿军在朝鲜作战，不仅保卫了我们的祖国，对于维护远东和世界的和平也起着极重大的作用；这正是有着国际主义和爱国主义精神的中国人民所应当有的行为。
    苏联军队的国际主义和爱国主义的精神，得到了全世界人民的颂扬。在亚洲和欧洲的大陆上，各国人民为了永远纪念自己的解放者，建立了许多纪念碑。这些纪念碑标志着苏军的光荣，标志着各国人民对苏联人民的崇敬和爱戴，也标志着各国人民和苏联人民的战斗友谊。在柏林的公园里，在布达佩斯的自由广场，在平壤的牡丹台，在我国东北的各地，到处都有这些人类最珍宝的纪念物。这些纪念物使各国人民心中永远铭刻下对苏联的友谊。现在，朝鲜人民也为我们志愿军立下了许多的这种建筑物，在铁血山上，在咸兴城里，在朝鲜各地——志愿军洒下鲜血的地方。这种用血肉巩固起来的友谊同样地是牢不可破的。
    苏联军队高贵的革命英雄主义的品质，每时每刻都在鼓舞与激励着我们。我们志愿军中也已出现了无数的马特洛索夫式的英雄，如我们不朽的英雄杨根思，舍身抢救朝鲜溺水少年的罗盛教，以负伤的身体压响地雷，因而给部队打开冲锋道路的钢铁英雄张才树等等。他们都是在革命英雄主义精神的召感下产生出来的。我们因有了这些马特洛索夫式的英雄们而感到人民军队的骄傲。像“日日夜夜”中的沙布洛夫，“恐惧与无畏”中的巴武尔章这些艰苦卓绝、英勇机智的苏军优秀指挥员，更是我们志愿军中指挥人员所崇敬的对象和学习的榜样。我们志愿军中今天也日益增多地出现了像郭忠田、周文江、崔建国等的优秀的青年指挥人员。
    我们在马列主义的军事思想指导下，学习了斯大林的军事科学；我们有着四亿七千五百万祖国人民的热烈支援。我们的武器装备正在日益加强起来，迅速地向着世界上最新型的、最科学的、最现代化的苏军看齐，这也是我们取得胜利的重要因素。
    虽然面对着我们的是世界上最后一个最强大、最凶恶的美帝国主义及其十几个帮凶国家的军队，虽然这些吃人的生番已遭受了重大的失败而还未最后放下武器，但我们在苏联军队击败德国法西斯及其帮凶军队的胜利的鼓舞下，和全世界人民的支援下，坚信一定能够取得最后的胜利。我们深信美帝国主义者的一切侵略阴谋必将失败。强大无比的苏联军队就是人类和平幸福的保证。在庆祝苏联建军三十四周年纪念的今天，我们热烈地向苏联军队欢呼万岁！
