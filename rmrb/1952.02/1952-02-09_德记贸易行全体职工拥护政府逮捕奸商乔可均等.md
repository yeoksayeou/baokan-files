    The Entire Staff of Deji Trading Company
    Support the Government's Arrest of the Unscrupulous Merchants Qiao Kejun and Others

    To the Editor: We resolutely support the government's arrest of Qiao Kejun, manager of the unscrupulous merchant Deji Trading Company, and deputy managers Zhang Zhiwen and Zhang Yunfeng.

    Qiao Kejun and others are not just big, unscrupulous merchants, but also traitors and spies. After liberation, instead of repenting properly and performing meritorious service for the people to redeem themselves, they secretly undermined the unity of our working class. For example, when we wanted to join the trade union, they said, "We are all 'colleagues,' there are no 'employees'." Qiao Kejun also said to us: "Once you are full and warm, you forget your roots." He often used despicable and malicious means such as division, suppression, and bribery to undermine the unity of the workers. Even more hateful was that at the end of 1951, they wanted us to take out our remuneration and invest with them jointly, attempting to blur our class consciousness. In this anti-bribery and anti-tax evasion movement, we awakened and saw clearly the ugly crimes of the big, unscrupulous merchant Qiao Kejun. Although we do not know many specific facts, we were able to trace and find many clues and evidence to assist the inspection team sent by the government to conduct in-depth inspections and expose their crimes.

    Through this inspection, our staff and workers have united as never before. We have also exposed all the hypocritical benevolence of the capitalists towards us in the past. Now, we have organized ourselves to assist the People's Government in further in-depth inspections, and under the leadership of the trade union, we will study hard, stand firm, and resolutely fight those illegal capitalists to the end.

    The Entire Staff of Deji Trading Company

### 德记贸易行全体职工拥护政府逮捕奸商乔可均等

    德记贸易行全体职工
    拥护政府逮捕奸商乔可均等
    编辑同志：我们坚决拥护政府逮捕奸商德记贸易行经理乔可均、副经理张之闻、张云峰。
    乔可均等不只是大奸商，而且是汉奸、特务。解放后，他们不但不好好悔改，向人民立功赎罪，反而暗中破坏我们工人阶级的团结。例如，我们要加入工会，他们就说：“我们都是‘同人’，没有‘职工’”乔可均还对我们说：“你们吃饱了，穿暖了，就忘了本。”他常用分化、打击、利诱等卑鄙恶毒手段，破坏工人的团结。更可恨的是他们在一九五一年底，要我们拿出酬劳金和他们共同投资，企图模糊我们的阶级意识。在这次反行贿、反偷漏税运动中，我们觉醒了，我们看清了大奸商乔可均的丑恶罪行。虽然我们知道的具体事实并不多，但我们却能够追踪查寻出不少线索和证据，协助政府派来的检查组，深入检查，揭发他们的罪行。
    通过这次检查，我们职工之间空前团结起来了。过去资本家对我们的假仁假义，我们也一齐把它揭穿了。现在，我们已经组织起来，协助人民政府，进一步地深入检查，并在工会的领导下，努力学习，站稳立场，坚决和那些不法的资本家们斗争到底。
