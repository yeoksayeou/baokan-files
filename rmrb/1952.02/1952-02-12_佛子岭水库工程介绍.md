Introduction to the Foziling Reservoir Project

One of the goals of the Huai River Harnessing Project is to impound 12 billion cubic meters of floodwater. In addition to utilizing lakes and depressions to hold easily flooded water, many valley reservoirs will be built on the upper reaches of the Huai River's main streams and tributaries to store water. Harnessing the Huai River should both eliminate harm and promote benefits, and building reservoirs is a way to do both. The Foziling Reservoir is a large-scale valley reservoir in the upper reaches of the Pi River in the middle reaches of the Huai River. The Pi River is a tributary of the Huai River in the middle reaches. It originates in Huoshan, passes through Liu'an County to the north, and flows into the Huai River at Zhengyangguan. The Pi River basin covers an area of approximately 6,700 square kilometers. Because 70% of the basin area is mountainous, the Pi River's flood peak is very large during the flood season each year, often causing severe floods in the downstream and on both sides of the Huai River below Zhengyangguan. However, in September and October, when the rice is earing and wheat is being sown, and crops need water, the banks of the Pi River suffer from drought, and crops are in short supply every year due to lack of irrigation water.

The dam site of the Foziling Reservoir is located 17 kilometers south of Huoshan County, in the Pi River valley south of Dayuchong, Foziling. The Dabie Mountains extend and stretch, forming a bag-shaped valley with steep cliffs and cliffs here, and the Pi River's flood rushes straight down through here. The Foziling Reservoir makes use of this valley. A modern reinforced concrete hollow dam will be built between the mountains, about 200 meters above sea level, facing each other across the valley, 200 meters apart, to block the flood of the Pi River. The dam's style is a continuous arch. The upstream face of the dam is a semi-circular arch, forming an angle of 45 degrees with the horizon; the downstream face of the dam is twenty-three dam piers, used to support the dam arch of the upstream face. This dam is 70 meters high and 530 meters long. The left end of the dam is a spillway, which will be equipped with a 5.5-meter-wide and 5-meter-high gate to discharge floodwaters exceeding the reservoir's specified water level and protect the dam's body. Eight 1.75-meter-square high-pressure gates, two 1.75-meter-square sand flushing gates, and three 1.25-meter-diameter circular gates will be installed inside the dam. This will allow the reservoir to discharge and store water freely. When water is not needed, water can be completely shut off. When water is needed, it can discharge water at a flow rate of 640 cubic meters per second.

The construction of the Foziling Reservoir is an extremely complex and highly technical project, requiring more than 100,000 tons of materials. This includes 54,760 tons of cement, 270,000 cubic meters of yellow sand and gravel, 3,360 tons of steel bars, 500 tons of steel sheet piles, more than 17,000 tons of various fuels, as well as a large amount of bamboo and wood templates, and light rails, dump trucks, and nearly 300 sets of more than 20 kinds of modern machines. These machines include electric winches (to replace a large amount of manpower to raise 0.4 cubic meters of concrete from the ground to more than 200 feet), electric vibrators (to vibrate the poured concrete to make it more uniform and solid), and the latest Soviet-style pile drivers and grouting machines (to perform grouting in the dam rock layer). These machines are being used for the first time in China's water conservancy construction, and it is worth being proud that these machines will all be manufactured in the factories of the Chinese people themselves.

After the completion of the Foziling Reservoir, it will be able to hold 470 million cubic meters of floodwater, nine times larger than the Shimantan Reservoir. After the completion of the Foziling Reservoir, the Pi River's flood flow will be reduced from more than 2,330 cubic meters per second to 640 cubic meters per second. From then on, the floods in the Pi River basin will be basically eliminated, and the flood peak of the main stream of the Huai River below Zhengyangguan will also be reduced.

The Foziling Reservoir is being built in accordance with the multi-objective construction policy. After the reservoir is completed, an irrigation canal will be built from Hengpaitou below the reservoir to Yingheji, and 500,000 mu of fertile farmland on the right bank of the middle and lower reaches of the Pi River will be fully irrigated. It also opens up a route for promoting the large-scale native products of bamboo, wood, tea, and hemp in the Dabie Mountain area. The reservoir will fully supply the water volume for the route, so that wooden boats with a deadweight of 50 tons can travel directly to the Huai River from Hengpaitou even during the dry season. The Foziling Reservoir can also use hydropower to generate 1,300 kilowatts to 3,000 kilowatts of electricity for industrial use. In this way, we can use the abundant resources of the Dabie Mountain area to set up pulp, sawmill, chemical fertilizer, glass, agricultural product processing and other factories on the spot, so as to turn the banks of the Pi River into a new industrial zone.

The construction project of the Foziling Reservoir has started. Today, the people of the Dabie Mountain area, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition in the domestic revolutionary war, are closely integrated with workers, engineering and technical personnel, and cadres from all over the country on the construction front of the motherland, and are acting to create a better life. The Pi River, which has been harmful for many years, will soon become a Pi River that benefits the people, and towns and vast rural areas such as Huoshan and Liu'an in the middle and lower reaches of the Pi River will move towards prosperity.

    佛子岭水库工程介绍
    治淮工程中要修许多水库，现在正在修的佛子岭水库是其中较大的一个。
    拦蓄洪水一百二十亿立方公尺是根治淮河的目标之一。这除利用湖泊洼地把容易泛滥的洪水拦蓄起来以外，还要在淮河干支流上游修许多山谷水库来蓄水。治淮既要除害又要兴利，修水库正就是又除害又兴利的办法。佛子岭水库便是淮河中游、淠河上游的一个巨型的山谷水库。淠河淮河中游的一条支流，发源于霍山，向北经过六安县到正阳关流入淮河。淠河流域的面积约有六千七百平方公里，由于百分之七十的流域面积是山区，以致每年汛期淠河洪水峰很大，常常造成下游和正阳关以下淮河两岸的严重水灾；而到了九、十月间，正当稻禾簇莠，麦田下种，农作物需要用水的时候，淠河两岸却闹旱灾，农作物因缺水灌溉而年年歉收。
    佛子岭水库的坝址，在淠河流域的霍山县城以南十七公里，佛子岭打鱼冲南的淠河峡谷内。大别山脉绵延伸展，在此环抱成一个陡壁峭崖的袋形山谷，淠河的洪水就通过这里急转直下。佛子岭水库就利用这个山谷。在东西两个拔海二百公尺左右的遥遥相对的山峰下，在相隔两百公尺的山谷间，修一座近代化的钢筋混凝土的空心拦河坝，以拦蓄淠河的洪水。坝的式样是连拱式。坝的迎水面是半圆形的拱，和地平线成四十五度的角度；坝的背水面是二十三座坝垛，用来支持迎水面的坝拱。这座坝高达七十公尺，长五百三十公尺。坝的左端是溢洪道，要安装一座五点五公尺宽，五公尺高的闸门，以便泄出超过水库规定水位以上的洪水，保护坝身的安全。坝的腹内要装置一点七五公尺见方的高压闸门八扇；一点七五公尺见方的冲沙闸门两扇；一点二五公尺直径的圆形闸门三扇。这样可使水库泄水、蓄水操纵自如，不需排水时可以完全不放水，要放水时能放出流量达六百四十秒公方的水。
    修建佛子岭水库，是一项极为复杂的高度技术性的工程，它需要的器材在十万吨以上。其中包括五万四千七百六十吨水泥，二十七万公方黄沙和石子，三千三百六十吨钢筋，五百吨钢板桩，各种油料一万七千多吨，以及大宗的竹木模板，和轻便铁轨、斗车以及二十多种、近三百部的现代化机器。这些机器包括电动卷扬机（代替大批人力把零点四公方的混凝土由地平面升高二百英尺以上），电动震动机（震动浇灌过的混凝土，使其更加均匀和坚实），苏联最新式的打桩机和灌浆机（进行坝岩层里的灌浆）。这些机械在我国水利建设上还是第一次运用，而值得自豪的是这些机械都将在中国人民自己的工厂里制造出来。
    佛子岭水库修成后，将可拦蓄四亿七千万立方公尺的洪水，比石漫滩水库大九倍。佛子岭水库修成后，将使淠河洪水流量由二千三百三十秒公方以上减到六百四十秒公方。从此淠河流域的水灾将基本消除，同时正阳关以下淮河干流的洪水峰也可降低。
    佛子岭水库是按照多目标的建设方针修建的，水库完成后，从水库下面的横排头到迎河集再修筑一条灌溉渠，淠河中、下游右岸的五十万亩土质肥沃的农田，就可以得到充分的灌溉。它更为推销大别山区的竹、木、茶、麻等大宗土特产开辟一条航路，水库将充分供应航路的水量，使载重五十吨的木船，即便在枯水季节也可由横排头直通淮河。佛子岭水库还可利用水力发电一千三百瓩到三千瓩供应工业。这样，我们就可利用大别山区的雄厚资源，就地开设纸浆、锯木、化学肥料、玻璃、农产品加工等工厂，从而使淠河两岸变为一个新型的工业区。
    佛子岭水库的修建工程开工了。在国内革命战争中有着光荣革命传统的大别山区人民，今天，又在祖国建设的阵地上，和来自各地的工人、工程技术人员和干部紧密地结合在一起，为创造美好的生活而行动起来了。多年为害的淠河，不久将变成一条为人民兴利的淠河，淠河中下游的霍山、六安等城镇和广大乡村将走向繁荣。
