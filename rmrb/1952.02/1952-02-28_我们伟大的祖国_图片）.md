The workers of the branch of the state-owned Tianjin Paper Mill, in order to supply a large amount of paper for publication and meet the needs of cultural construction, after research, modified the old-fashioned machine that originally manufactured straw paper to produce newsprint (capable of producing two sheets of newsprint simultaneously). This is a scene of the workers inspecting the quality of the paper.
