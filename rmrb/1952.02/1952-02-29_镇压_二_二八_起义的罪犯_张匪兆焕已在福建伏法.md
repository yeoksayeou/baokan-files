Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 28th: Zhang Zhaohuan, one of the executioners who participated in directing the suppression of the Taiwan people's "February 28th" uprising five years ago, has been executed in his hometown of Xianyou County, Fujian Province. The bandit Zhang Zhaohuan was a Kuomintang Central Statistics Bureau special agent who consistently slaughtered the people. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Zhang served as the Secretary-General of the Kuomintang Taiwan Provincial Party Headquarters. At that time, the people of Taiwan could not bear the cruel rule of the Chiang bandit gang and launched an armed uprising on February 28, 1947. At this time, Zhang participated in directing the Chiang bandit army and special agents in a large-scale massacre of Taiwan compatriots, resulting in a bloody tragedy in which the Kuomintang bandit gang massacred more than 30,000 innocent people. After the liberation of Fujian, Zhang carried a radio transmitter and hid in Fuzhou to carry out sabotage activities. He finally could not escape the people's grasp. Last summer, he was arrested by the Fujian Provincial People's Public Security Bureau and executed by firing squad after a public trial by the local people.

    镇压“二·二八”起义的罪犯
    张匪兆焕已在福建伏法
    【新华社福州二十八日电】在五年前曾参与指挥镇压台湾人民“二·二八”起义的刽子手之一张匪兆焕，已在原籍福建省仙游县伏法。张匪兆焕是一贯屠杀人民的国民党中统特务分子。抗日战争胜利后，张匪任国民党台湾省党部书记长。那时，台湾人民不堪蒋匪帮的残酷统治，在一九四七年二月二十八日举行了武装起义，此时，张匪即参加指挥蒋匪军和特务大规模地屠杀台湾同胞，造成了国民党匪帮一次屠杀三万余无辜人民的流血惨案。福建解放后，张匪携带电台潜伏福州进行破坏活动，终于难逃人民巨掌，在去年夏季，为福建省人民公安机关逮捕，经当地人民公审后执行枪决。
