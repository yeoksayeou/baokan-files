    Salutations to Our Chinese Friends
    Pavel Bykov, Stalin Prize Winner, High-Speed Lathe Operator of the Soviet Union
    Two full years have passed since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

    The Soviet people rejoice in the achievements of their great ally – the People's Republic of China. We see that liberated China has changed its face in a short period of time. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have made tremendous achievements in economic construction and in consolidating the people's democratic system.

    On this significant day, I would like to share with my Chinese friends my own achievements and those of my comrades. In recent years, a new movement has been widely promoted in our Soviet industry – the high-speed lathe work movement. High-speed lathe work refers to production innovators who adopt the latest technical operating procedures and use increased speeds to process metal.

    Soviet high-speed workers, in cooperation with engineers and scholars, are improving metal processing methods, boldly delving into new technical operating procedures, and creating new tools.

    All the workers at the Moscow Grinding Machine Factory (where I work as a lathe operator) achieved great production results in 1951. The number of high-speed workers in our factory increased by 25 percent in 1951 compared to 1950. Now, the vast majority of lathe operators in the factory use high-speed methods.

    Due to the adoption of high-speed metal cutting methods, I completed 25 years' worth of quotas during the post-war Five-Year Plan period, meaning I completed five years' worth of quotas each year. In 1951, the speed at which I cut steel reached 2,400 meters per minute. In 1951, I developed technical operating procedures for high-speed cast iron milling. Before this, the record-breaking speed for cast iron milling did not exceed 250 meters per minute. Thanks to the use of new kiln-fired cutting tools, in December 1951, I reached an unprecedented cast iron milling speed of 1,845 meters per minute. The labor productivity of this work increased more than sixfold. Due to the widespread development of the high-speed worker movement within the factory, we established entire high-speed work sections, and later, even high-speed workshops. However, the Soviet people are never satisfied with their achievements. I plan to achieve even higher metal cutting speeds in 1952. My goal is to reach 3,000 to 3,500 meters per minute when turning steel parts. This task is not easy, but it is entirely achievable.

    I widely disseminate my experience to Soviet workers and workers in various people's democratic countries. I have been to Leningrad, Kharkov, Tbilisi, and other cities in the Soviet Union, as well as Hungary, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic.

    In order to introduce my experience as widely as possible, I wrote a book entitled "The Road to Happiness," in which I describe in detail my methods and achievements in cutting metal at high speed.

    Dear Comrades!

    From the newspapers, we know that Chinese workers are successfully adopting the advanced methods of our Soviet workers in their own production.

    Our experience is helping the working class of free China to build a new life and consolidate the people's democratic system, and we Soviet people are pleased about this.

    The achievements of the Soviet and Chinese peoples in peaceful construction are the best contribution to the overall cause of consolidating peace.

    Two years have passed since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and these two years have fully demonstrated the great vitality of this treaty. Our treaty is a powerful guarantee for ensuring victory in the struggle to defend peace in the Far East and the world and to oppose aggression.

    I heartily congratulate my Chinese comrades on their achievements and wish them new victories in building a free and happy life.

    I would like to conclude my congratulations with a passage from a Soviet song praising the friendship between the great peoples of the Soviet Union and China:

    There is no closer friendship in the world,
    Our ranks are filled with joy!
    This marching column is the Soviet Union!
    A strong column, the Soviet Union!
    Advancing shoulder to shoulder is the new China!
    New China! New China!

    向中国朋友们致敬
    苏联高速度镟工斯大林奖金获得者  巴威尔·贝柯夫
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订到现在已经整整两年了。
    苏联人民为自己的伟大的盟友——中华人民共和国——的成就而欢呼。我们看到，解放了的中国在短短的期间内改变了样子，在中国共产党和中国人民的领袖毛泽东的领导下，中国人民在经济建设以及巩固人民民主制度方面都获得了巨大的成就。
    在这个意义重大的日子里，我想向中国朋友们谈谈自己的成就以及我的同志们的成就。近年来，我们苏联工业中曾广泛地推行一个新的运动——高速度镟工运动。高速度镟工，就是生产革新者，他采用最新的技术操作规程，用提高了的速度来进行金属的加工。
    苏联的高速度工作者，与工程师和学者合作，改进着金属的加工方法，大胆地钻研着新的技术操作规程，创造着新的工具。
    莫斯科磨床工厂（我在那里当镟工）的全体工人在一九五一年中获得了巨大的生产成绩。一九五一年我们工厂的高速度工作者的人数比一九五○年增加了百分之二十五。现在，厂里绝大多数的车床工人都采用高速度方法进行工作。
    由于采用高速度方法切削金属，我在战后五年计划期间完成了二十五年的定额，也就是说我每年完成五年定额。一九五一年，我切削钢的速度达到每分钟二千四百公尺。我于一九五一年制订了铣铁高速切削的技术操作规程。在这以前，铣铁切削的创纪录的速度不超过每分钟二百五十公尺。由于采用了新式的窑制削刀，一九五一年十二月间我达到了前所未有的铣铁切削速度——每分钟一千八百四十五公尺。这项工作的劳动生产率增加了六倍多。由于厂内高速度工作者运动的广泛开展，我们工厂就建立了整个的高速度工段，以后则更建立了高速度的车间。但是，苏联人从来不满足于既得的成就。我打算在一九五二年能达到更高的金属切削速度。我的奋斗目标是：镟制钢的零件每分钟达到三千至三千五百公尺。这个任务不是容易的，但却是完全可以实现的。
    我把自己的经验广泛地传播给苏联工人和各个人民民主国家的工人。我曾到过列宁格勒、哈尔科夫、第比利斯以及苏联其他城市，也到过匈牙利、罗马尼亚和德意志民主共和国。
    为了尽可能广泛地介绍自己的经验，我写了一本书，书名是“幸福之路”，在这本书里，我详尽地叙述了自己以高速度切削金属的方法和成绩。
    亲爱的同志们！
    从报上我们知道中国工人在自己的生产中正顺利地采用着我们苏联工人的先进方法。
    我们的经验在帮助着自由中国的工人阶级建设新生活、巩固人民民主制度，我们苏联人民为此感到高兴。
    苏中两国人民在和平建设中的成就是对巩固和平的总的事业的最好贡献。
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两年了，这两年充分显示了这个条约巨大的活力。我们的条约是使保卫远东与全世界的和平与反对侵略的斗争取得胜利的强有力的保证。
    我衷心地向中国同志们祝贺他们已获得的成就，并祝他们在建设自由幸福的生活中获得新的胜利。
    我要以歌颂苏中两国伟大人民友谊的一支苏联歌曲中的一段歌词来结束我的祝贺：
    世上再没有更亲的友情，
    我们的行列充满了欢腾！
    这行走的大队是苏维埃联盟！
    坚强的大队苏维埃联盟！
    并肩前进的是新的中国！
    新的中国！新的中国！
