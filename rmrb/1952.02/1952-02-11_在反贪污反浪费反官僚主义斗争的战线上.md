    On the Battlefront of the Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy
    Tianjin Construction Workers Expose Dishonest Merchants and Foremen
    In the twenty days of attacking unscrupulous construction contractors and feudal foremen, construction workers in Tianjin have reported more than 8,000 cases. According to incomplete statistics, these dishonest merchants have stolen nearly 20 billion yuan of state property. On the 6th, more than 10,000 construction workers in the city held a rally to accuse and expose wrongdoers. Yang Jixiu, a representative of the staff of a private construction factory, accused unscrupulous contractors such as Huang Keqi of their crimes. In contracting the construction project of the new gauze factory of the Tianjin State-owned No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, the dishonest merchant Huang Keqi and others defrauded the state of 4 billion yuan. Construction workers Liu Wenyuan and Huo Guangshu successively accused the feudal foreman Fu Baoyuan of his crimes. Fu Baoyuan once helped the Japanese invaders recruit Chinese laborers, and many workers were killed as a result. After the liberation of Tianjin, he colluded with dishonest merchants to embezzle more than 700 million yuan by illegally exploiting workers and raising wages. During the accusations, public security personnel escorted the dishonest merchant Huang Keqi, the feudal foreman Fu Baoyuan, and others to the venue. All the workers demanded that the government severely punish unscrupulous merchants and feudal foremen.
    Huang Huoqing, Deputy Director of the Tianjin Municipal Savings Inspection Committee and Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out in his speech that unscrupulous construction contractors are very harmful to national construction. They are robbers who steal state property, and feudal foremen are their accomplices. He called on construction workers throughout the city to thoroughly eliminate the illegal activities of unscrupulous merchants and feudal foremen in the construction industry.
    Shenyang Sends Out a Strong Force to Besiege Major Dishonest Merchants
    The Shenyang Municipal Savings Inspection Committee is sorting out the criminal materials of several major dishonest merchants. At the same time, it is also drawing more than 700 government cadres to form 150 inspection teams to investigate the crimes of major dishonest merchants in depth in various districts by means of detailed accounting. In addition, it has mobilized 12,000 university and middle school students, street propagandists, and street cadres to form a strong propaganda force to mobilize employees of private enterprises and citizens to participate in reporting. At present, under the pressure of the masses, some unscrupulous merchants have begun to differentiate internally: some small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen have begun to confess their illegal activities and report other unscrupulous industrialists and businessmen; and some small industrialists and businessmen whose crimes are extremely minor have also actively participated in the reporting movement. This is increasingly isolating those stubborn major dishonest merchants.
    Shanghai Democratic Parties Meet to Mobilize
    The Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held a meeting of cadres from the Shanghai local organizations of various democratic parties on the 4th to mobilize members of various democratic parties to actively participate in the struggle against corruption and bribery. Shen Zhiyuan, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic League, criticized some people who believe that the democratic parties themselves do not have much corruption and waste, and therefore adopt a passive attitude such as standing idly by. He pointed out that members of various democratic parties should contact the masses they represent and actively participate in the struggle. Sheng Pihua, convener of the Shanghai Provisional Working Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, and Zhao Zukang, member of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, also spoke at the meeting. Cui Songquan, a member of the China National Democratic Construction Association and manager of Shanghai Daguangming Watch Shop, and Qian Jiapiao, manager of a large pharmacy, confessed to the conference their illegal acts of bribery, fraud, and undermining government financial laws.
    Yellow River Conservancy Commission Pursues Corrupt Officials
    The Yellow River Conservancy Commission and its subordinate units have captured four major corrupt officials who have embezzled more than 100 million yuan. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission has adopted a method of fierce attack and relentless pursuit against major corrupt officials. For example, Zhou Xianglun (engineer of the Surveying and Testing Department), a major corrupt official, embezzled 120 million yuan. In the early stage of the movement, he first made an "offensive and defensive alliance" with his accomplices. At the agency's self-criticism and exposure conference, he was afraid of being exposed by others, so he voluntarily went on stage, wept bitterly, and "confessed" that he had over-reported 500,000 yuan in travel expenses. The leadership repeatedly mobilized him, but he still refused to confess. It was not until his corrupt accomplices were broken through that he confessed to accepting huge bribes from private merchants. However, he still refused to confess to the theft and sale of three theodolites. Later, the agency held a symposium of veteran engineers to discuss the situation of the former Yellow River General Bureau, which clarified the situation of Zhou Xianglun's theft and sale of three theodolites. Later, the masses were mobilized to carry out the struggle, and finally the ironclad facts forced him to confess his theft.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争的战线上
    天津建筑工人检举奸商和把头
    天津市建筑工人向不法营造厂商和大封建把头围攻的二十天中，已检举案件八千多起；据不完全统计，这些奸商盗窃国家财产近二百亿元。六日，全市建筑工人一万多人，举行控诉、检举大会。私营营造厂职员代表杨继修控诉了不法营造商黄克奇等的罪行。奸商黄克奇等在承包天津国营第二棉纺织厂新纱布场的修建工程中，竟诈骗国家资财四十亿元。建筑工人刘文元、霍广树相继控诉了大封建把头傅宝元的罪行。傅宝元曾帮助日寇招华工，许多工人因此被害死。天津解放后，他勾结奸商用非法剥削工人、抬高工价等手段贪污七亿多元。在控诉进行中，由公安人员将奸商黄克奇、大封建把头傅宝元等押到会场。全体工人要求政府严惩不法奸商和大封建把头。
    天津市节约检查委员会副主任、市总工会主席黄火青讲话指出：不法营造商对国家建设危害很大，他们是偷窃国家财产的强盗，而封建把头就是他们的帮凶。他号召全市建筑工人把营造业中的奸商和大封建把头的不法行为彻底肃清。
    沈阳出动强大队伍围攻大奸商
    沈阳市节约检查委员会正在整理若干大奸商的犯罪材料，同时并抽调机关干部七百多名编成一百五十个检查小组，深入各区有重点地以算细账的方式调查大奸商的罪行。此外，又动员了大学、中学学生、街道宣传员和街道干部共一万二千人，组织成强大的宣传队伍，发动私营企业职工和市民参加检举。目前，若干不法奸商内部在群众的压力下已开始分化：一部分中、小工商业者已开始坦白了不法行为，并检举了其他不法工商业者；还有一部分罪行极轻的小工商业者，也已经积极参加了检举运动。这就日益使那些顽固的大奸商孤立起来。
    上海各民主党派集会动员
    上海市各界人民代表会议协商委员会在四日召开各民主党派上海地方组织的干部大会，动员各民主党派成员积极参加反贪污、反行贿斗争。中国民主同盟上海市支部主任委员沈志远批判了某些人认为民主党派本身贪污浪费不大，因而就采取袖手旁观等不积极的态度。他指出：各民主党派的成员应当联系其所代表的群众，积极参加斗争。民主建国会上海临时工作委员会召集人盛丕华、中国国民党革命委员会上海分会筹委会委员赵祖康也在会上讲了话。民主建国会会员、上海大光明钟表行经理崔松泉和广大药房经理钱家骠向大会坦白了他们的行贿、欺诈和破坏政府金融法令等非法行为。
    黄河水利委员会穷追贪污犯
    黄河水利委员会和所属各单位已捕捉到贪污一亿元以上的大贪污犯四名。黄河水利委员会对大贪污犯采取了猛打穷追的方法。如大贪污犯周相伦（测验处工程师）贪污一亿二千万元。在运动初期，他先和同谋者订了“攻守同盟”；在机关坦白检举大会上，怕别人检举而自动上台痛哭流涕地“坦白”他多报过五十万元的出差费。领导方面对他一再进行动员，但他仍拒不坦白。直到他的贪污同盟者被攻破后，他才坦白了接受私商巨款贿赂的事实。但他对盗卖三架经纬仪一事仍死不坦白。后来机关召开了老工程师座谈会，谈出伪黄河总局的情况，才把周相伦盗卖三架经纬仪的情况弄清。以后又发动群众进行斗争，终于用铁的事实迫他供出盗窃罪行。
