    Shanghai Jiaotong University Holds Exhibition
    Exposing Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy

    To the Editor: Shanghai Jiaotong University held an anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy exhibition, using physical objects, cartoons, figures, explanations, statistics, and other methods to expose the serious corruption and waste phenomena within the school, educating all teachers and students.

    Some professors in our school, using the school's name, engaged in business outside the school, evading taxes amounting to more than 100 million yuan. Jiang Ruzhou, director of the iron and wood factory, colluded with illegal merchants to engage in malpractice for personal gain. Once, he accepted bribes from merchants and bought nine engines, of which only one was barely usable. Now, Jiang has been arrested and brought to justice by the People's Court.

    Each department in our school has departmentalism, which has resulted in many instruments not being used to their full potential. The physics, hydraulic engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, and aeronautical engineering departments each have one or two drilling machines, planers, and lathes, but each department uses them for a maximum of only two hours per week. In a time when the country needs machinery so much, this kind of waste is absolutely unacceptable. The hygiene laboratory and chemical laboratory share twenty microscopes, yet the hygiene group spent another eight million yuan to buy one. The lax management system has also caused great losses. More than forty bottles of chemicals in the chemistry department have lost their labels and cannot be identified, resulting in a great loss. Some departments have no system for claiming drugs at all, only a sign that says "According to Conscience" on the medicine box. These phenomena expose our irresponsible attitude towards state property. There is also great waste in terms of manpower. Many units strive to send more workers, but when the workers are sent, they have nothing to do, causing some workers to go to the streets to work as laborers, watch alleys, and sell wontons.

### 上海交通大学举办展览会  揭发贪污、浪费和官僚主义

    上海交通大学举办展览会
    揭发贪污、浪费和官僚主义
    编辑同志：上海交通大学举办了一个反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义展览会，用实物、漫画、数字、说明、统计等方式，揭露了校内的严重贪污浪费现象，教育了全校师生。
    我校有些教授，用学校的名义，在校外经商，逃税达一亿多元。铁木工厂主任蒋汝舟串通不法商人营私舞弊，有一次他接受了商人的贿赂，买了九个发动机，能够勉强使用的只有一个。现在蒋犯已被人民法院逮捕法办。
    我校各系有本位主义思想，致使许多仪器不能物尽其用。物理系、水利系、化学工程系、土木工程系、航空系各系都有一两部钻床、刨床、车床，但是各系使用的时间每星期至多只有两小时。在国家这么需要器械的今天，这种浪费现象是绝对不能容许的。卫生实验室和化学实验室共存二十具显微镜，而卫生组又花了八百万元买来了一具。保管制度不严密，也引起很大的损失，化学系有四十多瓶药品丢了标签，无法识别是什么药，损失很大。有的系根本没有领取药物的制度，只在药品箱上贴着
    “各凭良心”的条子。这些现象暴露了我们对国家财产不负责任的态度。在人力方面也有很大的浪费，好些单位力争多派工友去，但是工友派去了，却无事可做，致使有些工友上街做小工、看弄堂、卖馄饨。
