    The Great Friendship Between the Chinese and Soviet People is an Invincible Force
    Combat Hero of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Li Qiyuan
    The second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is fast approaching. On this day of great historical significance, we express our warm congratulations and further consolidate the unity between China and the Soviet Union.
    The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is a proletarian class friendship, a truly like-minded friendship. The "ambition" of both peoples is communism, and the path of both peoples is Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, this friendship will be permanent, ever-developing, and unshakable.
    The Soviet people are not only our most loyal and reliable teachers and friends today, but also treated our country as equals and consistently aided the cause of our people's liberation in the thirty years before the founding of the People's Republic of China. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government was the first to establish diplomatic relations with our country and signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with us on February 14, 1950. This treaty severely hit the imperialist camp headed by US imperialism in its conspiracy to launch a new war, greatly encouraged the courage and confidence of peace-loving people all over the world in their struggle against imperialism, guaranteed peace and security in the world, especially in the Far East, and opened a new chapter in the friendship between China and the Soviet Union. In the past two years, thanks to the existence of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and thanks to the resolute struggle of the Chinese people and the Asian people, the US imperialist policy of aggression against the Far Eastern countries has suffered a major defeat. At the same time, the Soviet people, in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, have helped our country in various aspects of construction. With the help of our Soviet elder brother, many barren alkaline lands have now become vast farms with tractors running across them. Our industry and transportation have recovered and developed rapidly, and our cultural and educational undertakings have also greatly developed. Due to the full cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in international affairs, our country has also won many victories in diplomacy, and our international status has been further enhanced. All this proves that the unity between China and the Soviet Union will not only inevitably promote the prosperity of the two countries, but will also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice throughout the world.
    It is precisely because of this that the war group headed by US imperialism is extremely hostile to the friendship and unity between our Chinese and Soviet people. Recently, the US government again instructed the reactionary Japanese government to conclude a "peace treaty" with the remnant clique of the Kuomintang reactionaries. This act is another most serious and blatant provocation against our country after the San Francisco Conference in September 1951. In this way, the Japanese government has completely become a tool for US imperialism to carry out aggression in Asia. It is also clear that the Yoshida government is doing everything possible to drag the Japanese people into the bottomless pit of another war adventure. The US and Japanese reactionaries' provocation against us is intolerable. Our government and people have made great efforts to combat the US's conspiracy to arm Japan and carry out aggression in Asia. In particular, the existence of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is an important guarantee for crushing the resurgence of the Japanese bandits. We are convinced that the conspiracy of US imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries will inevitably fail, and the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union will surely win complete victory in the cause of defending peace in the Far East and the world.

    中苏人民的伟大友谊是不可战胜的力量
    中国人民解放军战斗英雄  李启元
    中苏友好同盟互助条约缔结两周年的日子快到了。在这个具有伟大历史意义的日子里，我们表示热烈的庆贺，进一步巩固中苏两国的团结。
    中苏两国人民的友谊，是无产阶级间的阶级友谊，是真正志同道合的友谊，两国人民的“志”都是共产主义，两国人民的道都是马克思、列宁主义，因而这种友谊，将是永久的，日益发展的，不可动摇的。
    苏联人民不仅在今天是我们最忠实、最可靠的良师益友，而且在中华人民共和国成立以前的三十年间，苏联始终以平等地位对待我国，始终援助我国人民的解放事业。在中华人民共和国成立以后，苏联政府第一个首先和我国建立了外交关系，并在一九五○年二月十四日跟我们签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约。这个条约严重地打击了以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营发动新战争的阴谋，大大鼓舞了全世界爱好和平人们反对帝国主义斗争的勇气和信心，保障了世界特别是远东的和平与安全，使中苏两国的友谊展开了新的一页。两年以来，由于中苏友好同盟互助条约的存在，由于中国人民和亚洲人民的坚决斗争，美帝国主义对远东各国的侵略政策遭受了重大的失败。同时，苏联人民根据中苏友好同盟互助条约的规定，从各方面帮助了我国的建设。在苏联老大哥帮助下，许多荒芜的碱地，现在已成为奔驰着拖拉机的巨大农场，我们的工业和交通事业很快恢复和发展了，我们的文化教育事业也大大发展了。由于中苏两国在国际事务上的充分合作，我国在外交方面也打了许多胜仗，我国的国际地位更加提高了。这一切都证明：中苏两大国的团结不仅必然要促进两国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。
    正是因为这样，所以美帝国主义为首的战争集团，才十分敌视我们中苏两国人民的友好和团结。最近，美国政府又指使日本反动政府，要和国民党反动残余集团订立“和约”，这种行为，是在一九五一年九月旧金山会议之后，又一次对我国最严重最露骨的一次挑衅。这样一来就完全把日本政府变成了美帝国主义在亚洲进行侵略的工具。也很明显，吉田政府正千方百计想把日本人民拖进再一次战争冒险的无底洞里去。美、日反动派们对我们的这种挑衅，是不能容忍的，对于打击美国武装日本在亚洲进行侵略的阴谋，我们的政府和人民已经做了很大的努力，特别是中苏友好同盟互助条约的存在，更是粉碎日本强盗再起的重要保障。我们确信：美帝国主义和日本反动派的阴谋必然失败，中苏两大国在保卫远东和世界和平的事业上，必将获得完全的胜利。（附图片）
