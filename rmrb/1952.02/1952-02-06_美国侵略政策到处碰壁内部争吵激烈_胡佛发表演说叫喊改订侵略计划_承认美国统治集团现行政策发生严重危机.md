Xinhua News Agency, February 5th—American Republican leader and former U.S. President Herbert Hoover delivered a radio address on January 27, issuing a serious warning about the comprehensive bankruptcy of U.S. aggression policy. He demanded that Truman's current policy, which has run into walls everywhere, be immediately replaced by another set of aggression policies. Following Hoover’s speech at the end of 1950, which kicked off the "Great Debate" on American foreign policy, this new speech by Hoover shows that American aggressors have suffered even more disastrous failures over the past year. Faced with these failures, the contradictions within the American ruling group have further intensified.

In his speech, Hoover admitted that the crisis of U.S. aggression policy has become more serious over the past year. Hoover publicly stated that his "anxiety" was "even greater than when he launched the ‘Great Debate’ on American foreign policy a year ago," "because American policy has failed to defend the United States from foreign aggression and internal economic collapse" (Associated Press). This means that Hoover believes that the international and domestic policies of the American ruling group have both experienced serious crises, or, in his own words, have made "big mistakes." To this end, he loudly called: "In light of the experience of the past year, Congress should re-examine our situation," "re-evaluate our policies."

In terms of international policy, Hoover first denounced the Truman administration for causing heavy sacrifices to the United States in the war of aggression against Korea, while the attempt to occupy the entire Korean peninsula has completely failed. Hoover believes that the United States cannot benefit from the current tactics of delaying the Korean armistice negotiations, and since the start of the armistice negotiations, the United States has suffered another 25,000 casualties. While expressing his grief over this utterly defeated situation, Hoover openly regretted that the Truman administration had not accepted MacArthur's arrogant plan to expand the Korean War, thus "voluntarily abandoning the opportunity for victory." However, despite this, Hoover did not propose, nor could he propose, any way to salvage the failure in Korea. Like other figures in the American ruling group, he could not find a solution to this problem.

Hoover pessimistically pointed out that the American plan to force Western European vassal states to expand their armaments and prepare for war has made no progress. He admitted that although the United States has racked its brains in an attempt to establish a so-called "European Army," the fact is: "Apart from the American and British divisions, it is difficult to find ten combat-ready divisions in the Western European armies today." He said: "The only significant increase in Western European ground forces in the past two years seems to be the troops sent by the United States. France promised to provide fifteen divisions by the end of 1952, but now it says it only has ten divisions, and has not even recruited them yet." As for the plan to establish West German troops, Hoover said it is "currently still on paper." Hoover could not help but admit that the rising anti-war sentiment among the people of Western Europe is the fundamental difficulty encountered by the arms expansion and war preparation movement in Western European countries. He worriedly stated that Europeans are not "afraid" of the so-called "Soviet aggression."

Hoover also fearfully spoke of the failure of U.S. aggression policies in the Far East and the Middle East. He said: "In South Asia and the Middle East, we are seeing major changes in political forces," and the people in these regions have "ignited the prairie fire of revolution against the West." The serious setbacks suffered by U.S. policy are even reflected in the United Nations. He said: "We often find that many of these countries in the United Nations vote against the United States."

What Hoover is equally afraid of is that the Truman administration's current policies are also causing a serious economic crisis at home. He said: "The prominent phenomenon in the United States now is that our huge expenditures are dangerously oppressing our economy. ... We have felt the pain of harmful inflation and heavy taxes." He also pointed out: "Despite these heavy taxes, the United States' financial deficit" may still be "between $30 billion and $40 billion." He said that the value of the dollar has been declining, and the government has repeatedly suffered defeats in its battle against inflation.

After reviewing all these depressing facts, Hoover demanded that the Truman administration's current policies be abandoned and replaced by his own seven-point plan. Among this new aggression plan proposed by Hoover, he emphasized: "The primary task of this country must be to defend this last Gibraltar of freedom—that is, the Western Hemisphere (the United States) itself." Therefore, the United States should stop sending ground troops to Europe and Asia, and the expansion of Western European ground forces should be the responsibility of Western European countries themselves. He said: "Except for establishing bases, Western Europe should take over all the ground defense obligations we bear." Hoover reiterated his proposal from a year ago: the United States should concentrate its efforts on expanding its air force and navy, "concentrating mobile offensive forces in the air and at sea." He believes that it is necessary to reduce the huge expenditures on expanding the army in order to avoid the collapse of America's economic strength.

Hoover's speech shows that new and more intense disputes are brewing within the American ruling group. An Associated Press report from New York on January 27th, in assessing the significance of Hoover's speech, stated: "Hoover has reopened the foreign policy ‘Great Debate’ that began a year ago."

    美国侵略政策到处碰壁内部争吵激烈
    胡佛发表演说叫喊改订侵略计划
    承认美国统治集团现行政策发生严重危机
    【新华社五日讯】美国共和党首脑人物之一、美国前总统胡佛，于一月二十七日发表广播演说，对美国侵略政策的全面破产发出严重的警告，要求立即以另一套侵略政策来代替杜鲁门政府已到处碰壁的现行政策。从一九五○年年底的胡佛演说揭开关于美国外交政策的“大辩论”之后，胡佛的这一篇新的演说，表明了一年来美国侵略者已遭到更惨重的失败，在这种失败面前，美国统治集团内部的矛盾已进一步尖锐起来。
    胡佛在演说中承认一年来美国侵略政策的危机已更加严重。胡佛公开声称：他的“忧虑”，“比一年以前他发动美国外交政策‘大辩论’的时候‘甚至更大’”，“因为美国政策没有能保卫住美国，使它不遭受外来侵略和内部经济崩溃”（合众社）。这就是说胡佛认为美国统治集团的国际和国内政策都已发生了严重的危机，或者用他自己的话来说，已铸成“大错”。为此，他大声呼号：“鉴于过去一年来的经验，国会应该重新检查我们的情况”，“重新估计一下我们的政策”。
    在国际政策方面，胡佛首先斥责杜鲁门政府使美国在侵略朝鲜的战争中遭到惨重牺牲，而占领全朝鲜的企图却已经完全失败。胡佛认为美国从目前所采取的拖延朝鲜停战谈判的手段中并不能得到好处，而自从停战谈判开始以来，美国方面又已伤亡了两万五千人。胡佛在对于这种一败涂地的局面表示痛心之余，竟公开惋惜杜鲁门政府没有接受麦克阿瑟的狂妄的扩大朝鲜战争的计划，因而“自行放弃了胜利的机会”。但是，尽管如此，胡佛并没有提出也不可能提出什么挽救在朝鲜的失败的办法，他和美国统治集团的其他人物一样在这个问题上丝毫也找不到出路。
    胡佛悲观地指出美国逼迫西欧附庸国扩军备战的计划毫无进展。他承认，尽管美国费尽心机企图建立所谓“欧洲军”，但是事实却是：“除了美国和英国的师团外，今天在西欧军队中很难找到十个能打仗的师团。”他说：“过去两年内西欧地面部队唯一大量的增加似乎是美国派去的军队，法国答应在一九五二年底以前提供十五个师，但是现在却说只有十个师，而且还没有招募。”至于建立西德部队的计划，胡佛说“目前还在纸上阶段”。胡佛不能不承认西欧人民日益高涨的反对战争的情绪是西欧各国扩军备战运动所遭到的根本困难。他忧虑地表示，欧洲人并不“害怕”所谓“苏联的侵略”。
    胡佛也恐惧地谈到美国侵略政策在远东与中东的失败，他说：“在南亚与中东，我们正在看到政治力量的大变动”，这些地区的人民已经“燃起了反对西方的革命的燎原之火”。美国政策遭到的严重挫折，甚至在联合国内也反映了出来，他说：“我们常常发现这些国家中有许多国家在联合国中投票反对美国。”
    胡佛同样感到害怕的，是杜鲁门政府的现行政策还在国内造成了严重的经济危机。他说：“美国现在突出的现象是：我国庞大的开支危险地压迫着我国的经济。……我们已经感受到为害严重的通货膨胀和苛捐杂税的痛苦。”他并且指出：“尽管有这些苛重的捐税，美国在财政上的赤字仍然“可能在三百亿美元到四百亿美元之间”。他说，美元的价值已经日益跌落，政府在对通货膨胀的作战上也不断地吃了败仗。
    胡佛在检阅了所有这些使他沮丧的事实以后，要求放弃杜鲁门政府的现行政策，而代之以他自己的七点计划。在胡佛所提出的这个新侵略计划中间，他着重说明：“这个国家的首要任务必须是保卫这个自由的最后直布罗陀——那就是西半球（美国）本身。”因此，美国应停止派遣地面部队到欧洲和亚洲去，扩充西欧地面部队一事应由西欧各国自行负责，他说：“除建立基地以外，西欧应接替我们所负担的一切地面防御义务。”胡佛重申他一年前的主张：美国应集中力量扩充空军和海军，“集中空中与海上的机动进攻力量”。他认为必须削减扩充陆军的庞大开支，才可以避免美国的经济力量的崩溃。
    胡佛的演说表明美国统治集团内部正在酝酿着新的更为激烈的争吵，合众社纽约一月二十七日电在估计胡佛演说的意义时表示：“胡佛已重新展开了一年前开始的外交政策‘大辩论’。”
