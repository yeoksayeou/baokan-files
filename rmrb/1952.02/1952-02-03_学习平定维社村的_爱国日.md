Learning from Weishedian Village's "Patriotic Day"
　　Yang Yinchun Sun Zongda

　　The method of regularly holding "Resist America, Aid Korea Patriotic Day" to check the patriotic pledge by the masses in Weishedian Village, Pindign County, Shanxi Province, has spread to Ande Village and Northeast Yang Village in the Second District of Xiangyuan County. The Communist Party branches of these two villages are leading the masses to check the implementation of the patriotic pledge. District cadre Shen Xihai gave a detailed introduction to everyone about the experience of Weishedian Village published in the newspaper. People in the village discussed it in twos and threes. Most people thought "this method is good, it can check everyone's patriotic actions, and it can also check the work of the whole village." But some people had different opinions. They said, "Having to hold meetings and Patriotic Days, isn't that a waste of work!" "The village has a people's school, why add more trouble!"

　　The Party branches of the two villages studied the experience of Weishedian Village and believed that observing "Patriotic Day" is a good way to conduct patriotic education among the masses. They decided to establish this system in their own villages as well. They collected opinions from the masses and then mobilized all propagandists to widely publicize the experience of Weishedian Village in implementing "Patriotic Day" to everyone through organizations such as people's schools and reading groups. The branch also organized everyone to discuss the ideological problems of some people. Gradually, everyone reached a consensus. Everyone believed that observing "Patriotic Day" could let everyone know about national affairs, promote various tasks, and solve problems in a concentrated manner, reduce meetings, and not delay production. Li Guisuo from the village said, "Observing 'Patriotic Day' is a great happy event for all of us in the village, and we must do it well. Before, our patriotic pledge was checked in the小组 (xiǎozǔ, small groups), and good experiences could not be exchanged immediately. With 'Patriotic Day,' the whole village checks collectively. With more people and more eyes, whoever implements the patriotic pledge well, everyone will praise him and learn from him; whoever does not implement it well, will be criticized and asked to correct it in the future. This is good for both the individual and the entire village."

　　Both villages made a decision to learn from the experience of Weishedian Village and observe "Patriotic Day" on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month. The first "Patriotic Day" was held on the first day of the twelfth lunar month.

　　In the last few days of the eleventh lunar month, the propagandists were all out, promoting from house to house. In order to welcome "Patriotic Day," each mutual aid team automatically made a preliminary check on the implementation of the patriotic pledge and worked hard to catch up with the unfinished work. Everyone wanted to strive to be a model for implementing the patriotic pledge.

　　On the first day, every family got up early and cleaned the streets and courtyards as if preparing for the New Year. After lunch, in the house where the "Patriotic Day" meeting was held, a portrait of Chairman Mao was hung up, and the five-star red flag was inserted on the door. Men and women, old and young, from the whole village came in groups to the lively sounds of gongs and drums.

　　The propagandists first sang some 快板 (kuàibǎn, clapper talk) at the meeting, leading everyone in a while of cultural and recreational activities. Then they talked about current affairs for a while, and then everyone began to check the patriotic pledge.

　　In Northeast Yang Village, the first to check the patriotic pledge was Wang Bujin, the secretary of the Communist Party branch. One of his patriotic pledges—to accumulate ten 担 (dàn, a unit of dry measure) of fertilizer—had not been fulfilled, so everyone criticized him for "just talking and not doing." He made a self-criticism on the spot. The patriotic pledge made by the Wang Shizhu mutual aid team in the village, all six articles were implemented, and they accumulated 1,484 担 of fertilizer in half a month, which can save more than three 石 (dàn, another unit of dry measure) of black beans next year. They were praised by everyone on the spot. Everyone also proposed to "learn from the Wang Shizhu mutual aid team." The meeting also summarized the achievements of the whole village in increasing production and practicing economy, and revised the patriotic pledge based on the existing achievements.

　　After the meeting, everyone was very happy. They said, "With 'Patriotic Day,' everyone becomes active, and work and production are all easy to do."

    学习平定维社村的“爱国日”    
    杨荫春  孙宗达
    山西平定维社村群众定期举行“抗美援朝爱国日”来检查爱国公约的办法，传到了襄垣县第二区的安德村和东北阳村。这两个村的中共支部，正在领导群众检查爱国公约的执行情况，区干部申喜孩，把报上登出的关于维社村的经验，向大家作了详细的介绍。村里的人，三三两两谈论起来了。大多数人觉得“这办法好，又能检查每个人的爱国行动，又能检查全村的工作”。可是有些人意见不同，他们说：“又要开会，又要过爱国日，那不是多误工！”“村上有民校，何必多添麻烦！”
    两个村的党的支部，都研究了维社村的经验，认为过“爱国日”是向群众进行爱国主义教育的好办法，决定在本村也建立这种制度。他们分别收集了群众的意见，然后发动所有宣传员，通过民校、读报组等组织，把维社村实行“爱国日”的经验，向大家普遍进行宣传。支部又针对一些人的思想问题，组织大家展开讨论。慢慢地，大家的意见一致了。大家认为过“爱国日”可以让大家知道国家大事，又能推动各种工作，而且集中解决问题，少开会，不误生产。村里李贵锁说：“过‘爱国日’是咱全村人的一件大喜事，要把它搞好。以前咱的爱国公约，是在小组里检查，好经验不能马上交换。有了‘爱国日’，全村集体来检查，人多眼多，谁对爱国公约执行的好，大家就表扬他，向他学习；谁执行的不好，就批评他，要他以后改正。这对个人和全村都有好处。”
    两个村都作了决定，学习维社村的经验，每逢阴历初一十五过“爱国日”。头一个“爱国日”，就在十二月初一举行。
    阴历十一月的末后几天，宣传员都出动了，到各家各户去宣传。各个互助组为了迎接“爱国日”，都自动把执行爱国公约的情况作了初步检查，把没有做完的工作加紧赶上，大伙的心里都想要争取做个执行爱国公约的模范。
    初一那天，家家一早起来，就把街院打扫得干干净净，就像准备过大年一样。午饭过后，在“爱国日”会场的房子里，挂起了毛主席的像，门上插着五星红旗，全村男男女女，老老少少，在热闹的锣鼓声中，一群一伙地赶来了。
    宣传员们首先在会上唱了一些快板，领导大家进行了一会文化娱乐活动。接着又讲了一会时事，然后大家开始检查爱国公约。
    在东北阳村，首先检查爱国公约的是中共支部书记王不锦。他的爱国公约有一条——积肥十担——没有实现，大家就批评他“光说不做”，他自己当场作了检讨。村里王石柱互助组订的爱国公约，六条都实现了，半个月积肥一千四百八十四担，明年可以节省三石多黑豆。当场受到了大家的表扬。大家并提出向“王石柱互助组学习”。会上又总结了全村增产节约的成绩，又根据已有成绩，修订了爱国公约。
    会后，大家都很高兴，他们说：“‘爱国日’过起来，人人都积极起来，工作和生产，什么都好搞了。”
