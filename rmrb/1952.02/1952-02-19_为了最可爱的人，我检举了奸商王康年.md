    For the Most Beloved People, I Reported the Profiteer Wang Kangnian
    Dong Yuan, Accounting Director of Shanghai Dakang Pharmacy

    Wang Kangnian, the owner of Dakang Pharmacy who, with utter disregard for conscience, stole and swindled huge sums of money intended for the purchase of medicine for the Chinese People's Volunteers, has been arrested and brought to justice by the People's Government on February 4th, after I reported him.

    I am the accounting director of Dakang Pharmacy, 26 years old this year. I joined Dakang Pharmacy as a cashier in 1947, and later became the accounting director. It has been five years now. From my work, I understand that Dakang Pharmacy does not have much fixed capital. It all relies on Wang Kangnian borrowing here and there and engaging in speculation to sustain it. Wang Kangnian’s operation of this pharmacy is full of tricks, both internally and externally. In doing business externally, the newspapers have already exposed his various illegal activities. In a word, he would use any despicable and shameless means as long as he could make money. Towards the employees, he used another set of tactics, suppressing, enticing, and combining soft and hard approaches, exhausting every despicable means. The wages of Dakang employees are higher compared to the general industry. He told us, "Everyone should work hard. If business is good, we will increase the subsidies." He used this kind of "care" to win us over, attempting to make us obediently used by him.

    He was very hostile to the trade union. Knowing that we wanted to join the union, he threatened us, saying, "If you join the union, I will have to close the shop." Later, after we joined the union, he lured Wang Zufan, an employee who had not yet joined the union, and announced that Wang would be made deputy manager, attempting to prevent Wang Zufan from joining the union and undermine the unity of the employees. However, Wang stood firm on his class position, saw through his conspiracy, and resolutely refused.

    Not long after liberation, Wang Kangnian pretended to be progressive, giving each employee a Lenin suit (in fact, he only paid half the money), and asked everyone to wear it. He said to us, "This way, we won't be afraid when the tax bureau comes to check the accounts in the future." Wang Kangnian consistently pretended to be positive, but secretly engaged in illegal business through various despicable and shameless means. Many cadres who came to Shanghai to purchase goods were fooled by him. He shamelessly said to us, "Dakang Pharmacy is a 'cadre ideological reform center'." Every time I think of this, I feel ashamed to work at Dakang.

    In November 1951, he became so insane and inhuman that he stole the payment for goods for the Chinese People's Volunteers. At first, I didn't notice because I was ideologically numb. It was not until December 11th of last year, when the goods were supposed to be delivered, that the warehouse employees, Ma Weishan and Teng Zhongnian, discovered that half of the goods were missing. They were very anxious and immediately reported it to the office. I thought this issue was very serious, so I directly questioned him at the labor-management symposium. However, Wang Kangnian downplayed it and said, "Korea is far away. It doesn't matter. I can handle this." Wang Kangnian's heinous crime cannot be tolerated by the people of the whole country. He sabotaged the Resist America, Aid Korea movement and is an enemy of the people of the whole country.

    After the launch of the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state property, anti-shoddy workmanship and materials, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement in Shanghai, three different attitudes were displayed among all employees: a very few people opposed reporting, fearing the store would close and they would lose their jobs; another thought that reporting or not was irrelevant to them; and then there were a few of us activists who resolutely advocated reporting this illegal profiteer.

    I repeatedly thought: I am a member of the Youth League and an organizer of the trade union. I should take the lead in this movement, and it is my bounden duty to report Wang Kangnian's crimes. Therefore, in the employee study group, I explained the policies of the People's Government to everyone, clarifying their confused thoughts; enlightened everyone to correctly understand the indivisibility of personal interests and national interests; criticized the dependent thinking of "if the store exists, I exist"; and also took time to conduct individual interviews with employees, trying to win over more employee comrades to the side of justice.

    I was very clear that after a completely evil profiteer like Wang Kangnian was reported, there was no question that Dakang Pharmacy would immediately close down. I had concerns in my mind at first. But thinking about the seriousness of Wang Kangnian's crimes, and thinking about the Volunteers fighting hard on the front lines in Korea, there was no reason for me to consider my personal problems. Therefore, I decided to report him and never let this heinous profiteer, hated by everyone, escape the people's grasp.

    On the morning of January 16th, I mailed the letter of report to box number 657 set up by Chairman Rao of the East China Military and Political Committee.

    Through the education of this event, the backward and middle-of-the-road employees realized that their past views were wrong, and their thinking improved. They unanimously expressed that under the leadership of the trade union, they would do a good job in the movement and strive to further improve their class consciousness in the movement. To date, all employees of Dakang Pharmacy have reported 101 crimes of the profiteer. We will continue to collect materials on the profiteer in depth, and together with the shop assistants of the whole city, resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks.

    为了最可爱的人，我检举了奸商王康年
    上海大康药房会计主任　董渊
    丧尽天良盗骗中国人民志愿军购药巨款的大康药房老板王康年，经我检举以后，已经在二月四日被人民政府逮捕法办了。
    我是大康药房的会计主任，今年二十六岁，一九四七年进大康药房做出纳，以后担任会计主任，到今天已经有五年的历史了。从工作中我了解大康药房并没有多少固定资金，全靠王康年在外面东拆西借投机取巧来支持。王康年经营这个药房，无论对内对外都是花样百出的。对外做生意，报纸上已经揭露了他多种多样的不法行为。一句话，无论什么卑劣无耻的手段，只要能赚钱他都使得出来。对职工则又是一套，压制、利诱，软硬兼施，极尽卑鄙之能事。大康职工的工资，和一般同业比较起来是高的。他对我们说：“大家好好地干，生意好了再增加津贴。”他就是用这种“照顾”来笼络我们，企图使我们驯服地为他利用。
    他对工会非常仇视。他晓得我们要参加工会，就威胁我们说：“你们加入工会，我只有关店。”后来，我们加入了工会，他就利诱当时还没有加入工会的职员王祖蕃，宣布叫王做副经理，企图以此阻止王祖蕃加入工会，破坏职工团结；但王站稳了阶级立场，看穿了他的阴谋，坚决拒绝了。
    在解放后不久，王康年伪装进步，发给职工每人一套列宁装（其实他只出了一半钱），让大家穿起来，他对我们说：“这样，以后税局来查账我们就不怕了。”王康年一贯伪装积极，暗中却以各种卑鄙无耻的手段来做违法的生意。各地来上海采购的干部，不少人上了他的当，他曾无耻地对我们说：“大康药房是‘干部思想改造所’”。我每一想到此事，就感到自己在大康工作，真是一件羞耻的事。
    一九五一年十一月间，他竟丧心病狂毫无人性地盗骗了中国人民志愿军的货款。开始时我因为思想上麻痹，没有发现。到了去年十二月十一日应该交货的那一天，货栈里的职工马维善和滕仲年才发现货色还缺一半，他们很着急，立刻反映到写字间来。我认为这个问题非常严重，就在劳资座谈会上当面向他提出质问，但王康年却轻描淡写地说：“朝鲜路远，没啥关系，这事我拿得稳。”王康年这种滔天罪行，是全国人民所不能容忍的。他破坏了抗美援朝运动，是全国人民的敌人。
    上海市反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动开展后，当时在全体职工中表现了三种不同的态度：极少数的人反对检举，怕关店失业；另一种认为检举不检举与自己无关；再一种就是我们几个积极分子，坚决主张要检举这个不法奸商。
    我曾反复想过：自己是一个青年团员，又是工会的组织员，在这次运动中应起带头作用，检举王康年的罪行是义不容辞的。因此，在职工学习小组上，我就向大家解释人民政府的政策，澄清大家的混乱思想；启发大家正确认识个人利益与国家利益的不可分割；批判了“店存在、我就存在”的依赖思想；并且又抽空深入职工进行个别访问，尽量争取更多的职工同志站到正义这边来。
    我很清楚，像王康年这样万恶透顶的奸商被检举以后，大康药房立刻关店是毫无问题的。我思想上起初也曾有过顾虑。但是想到王康年罪行的严重，想到在朝鲜前线艰苦作战的志愿军，再也没有丝毫理由容许我考虑个人的问题，因此我决定检举他，决不让这种人人痛恨的丧尽天良的奸商逃出人民的巨掌。
    在一月十六日上午，我把检举信投寄给华东军政委员会饶主席所设的第六五七号信箱。
    经过这次事实的教育，落后和中间的职工都认识到过去的看法是错误的，思想上提高了一步，一致表示要在工会的领导下，搞好运动，争取在运动中更加提高自己的阶级觉悟。到今天为止，大康药房全体职工检举奸商的罪行已有一百零一件。我们还要继续深入收集奸商材料，和全市店员同志们一起，坚决地击退资产阶级的猖狂进攻。
