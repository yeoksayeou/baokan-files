Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 22nd:

    To promote the economy drive, the soldiers of the First Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army on the Imjin River front held an economy exhibition in a small pine forest on the position. The exhibits were divided into three sections: weapons, clothing, and cooking, and consisted mostly of items used by the soldiers in their daily lives. The weapon section displayed the best-maintained bayonets, rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers, and other weapons in the company. Also on display were enemy ammunition and weapons that the soldiers had picked up from the positions and mud, including various rifles and machine guns, as well as spent cartridges and shells collected by the soldiers during combat. The most eye-catching items in the clothing section were: a single military uniform with three patches, six pairs of old shoes, more than a dozen pairs of tattered rubber shoes with only the soles remaining, and two pieces of torn tarpaulin. These four items were contributed by Wang Baozhu, an eighteen-year-old communication soldier. He plans to carefully sew and wash the single uniform to use as a shirt, and repair the six pairs of old shoes to wear for another three months. He guarantees to save a set of shirts and three pairs of shoes this year, and plans to burn the worn-out rubber shoe soles and torn tarpaulin as fuel when digging fortifications instead of lamp oil. Wang Baozhu expressed his feelings, "The people of the motherland have promised us: whatever you need, we will give you. Every bullet and every grain of rice shipped from the motherland contains the blood, sweat, and hopes of the people of the motherland. We should also promise the people of the motherland: we must cherish every item the people of the motherland give us." The cooking section displayed pot scrapings, bean dregs, flour sacks, rice sacks, egg powder boxes, etc. The instructions stated that the pot scrapings were to be used for cooking porridge, the bean dregs were to be stir-fried and used as vegetables, and the flour sacks, rice sacks, and egg powder boxes were to be returned in full after the flour, grain, and egg powder were used up. At this lively exhibition venue, the soldiers' wall newspaper "Economy Special Issue" and slogans and paintings created by the soldiers were posted. The slogans read: Improving tactical skills and fighting well is the greatest economy, and depicted actions such as practicing grenade throwing, aiming, and attacking. A quick-rhyme on the wall newspaper read: "Chairman Mao is the savior, leading China to brightness; New China is newly born, resisting America and aiding Korea for peace; We must fight the war and build the country, and not add to the burden of the people; Chairman Mao issued a call from Beijing, increase production and practice economy is a good idea, the call spread to Korea, and all the volunteers practiced economy; Improve tactics and techniques, kill more enemies and consume less ammunition; The economy drive is carried out well, and the people's happiness will come soon!"
    This economy exhibition not only educated the comrades of this company, but also brother units near the position came to visit in platoons and companies. After each visit, everyone expressed confidence in each other: In the future, we will not only continue to strike at the American aggressors on the front line, but also create new victories on the economy front.

    志愿军某部一连战士举办前线节约展览会
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十二日电】为了开展节约运动，临津江前线的志愿军某部第一连战士们在阵地上的一座小松树林里，举办了一个节约展览会。展览品分武器、服装、炊事三部分，陈列的大都是战士们在日常生活中使用的实物。在武器部分的展览品中陈列着的有：在这个连队中保护得最好的刺刀、步枪、机关枪、火箭筒等武器；还有该连战士们从阵地上、泥地里拾来的敌人遗弃的弹药和武器，其中有各种步枪和机关枪；还有战士们在战斗中收拾回来的子弹壳和炮弹壳。在服装部分的展览品中最引人注意的是：一件有着三个补绽的单军衣、六双破旧的鞋子、十几只破烂得只剩下底子的胶皮鞋和两块破烂雨布。这四种东西是十八岁的通讯员王保柱拿出来的。他计划把这件单军衣好好地缝洗一番当衬衣用，把六双旧鞋补好再穿三个月。他保证在今年要节约一套衬衣和三双鞋子，把穿坏了的胶皮鞋底和破烂雨布准备在挖工事时点燃它代替灯油。王保柱说出了自己这样做的心情：“祖国人民向我们提出保证：你们要什么我们就给什么。从祖国运来的每一颗子弹每一粒米都包含着祖国人民的血汗和希望。我们也应该向祖国人民提出保证：我们一定要爱护祖国人民给我们的每一件东西。”在炊事部分的展览品中陈列着的，有锅巴、豆腐渣、面粉口袋、装米的麻袋、蛋粉盒子等。说明书上注明着锅巴是准备煮稀饭吃的，豆腐渣是准备炒一炒当菜吃的，面粉袋、装米的麻袋和蛋粉盒准备在面粉、粮食、蛋粉吃完以后照数上缴。在这个生动的展览会会场上，张贴着战士们出版的墙报“节约专号”和战士们创造的标语画。标语画上面写着：提高战术技术打好仗，就是最大的节约；画着练习投弹、瞄准、进攻等动作。墙报上面有一首快板写道：“毛主席，是救星，领导中国向光明；新中国，刚诞生，抗美援朝为和平；仗要打，国要建，老百姓负担不能添；毛主席北京发号召，增产节约好主意，号召传到朝鲜后，志愿军人人来节约；提高战术和技术，打死敌人多，消耗弹药少；节约运动开展好，人民幸福早来到！”
    这个节约展览会不仅教育了本连的同志们，阵地附近的兄弟部队也都成班成排地前来参观。每个人参观以后都满怀信心地相互表示：今后不仅要在前线上继续打击美国侵略军，还要在节约战线上创造新胜利。
