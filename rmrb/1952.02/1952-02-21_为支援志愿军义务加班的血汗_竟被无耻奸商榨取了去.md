    For the Blood and Sweat of Overtime Volunteering to Support the Volunteer Army
    Was Actually Squeezed by Unscrupulous Merchants
    To the Editor: After seeing the news about the treacherous merchants Liu Yunsheng, Wang Defu, and others harming the Volunteer Army, we were all extremely indignant. All the workers in our factory volunteered to work overtime on Sundays to support our most beloved people. Take our group as an example, just the overtime work on Sundays repaired a five-ton crane and donated all the repair costs of four million yuan to the Volunteer Army. We did this so that "the rear can shed more sweat to reduce the blood shed at the front," in order to strive to defeat American imperialism as soon as possible.
    However, the wicked merchants have lost all conscience, skimping on materials and passing off shoddy goods as good goods to sell to the Volunteer Army. They use all kinds of despicable and filthy means to harm our most beloved people in order to seek exorbitant profits and satisfy their personal shameful desires.
    They have lost all national morality and have actually become accomplices of American imperialism. In order to defend our beloved motherland and thoroughly defeat the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks, we demand that the government give the most severe legal sanctions to the treacherous merchants who harm the Volunteer Army – the traitors of the motherland!

    为支援志愿军义务加班的血汗
    竟被无耻奸商榨取了去
    编辑同志：我们看到了刘云生、汪德孚等奸商暗害志愿军的消息后，都万分愤恨。我厂全体职工为了支援我们最可爱的人，在礼拜日自愿义务加班。就拿我们小组说吧，只是礼拜日的加班，便修理好一部五吨吊车，把全部修车费四百万元捐献给志愿军。我们为的是“后方多流一滴汗，前方少流一滴血”，以争取早日打垮美帝国主义的侵略。
    但是，万恶的奸商丧尽天良，偷工减料，以坏货充好货卖给志愿军。他们用种种卑鄙、龌龊的手段，暗害我们最可爱的人，以谋取暴利，满足个人可耻的欲望。
    他们已丧尽了国民公德，实际上成了美帝国主义的帮凶。为了保卫我们可爱的祖国，彻底打垮资产阶级猖狂的进攻，要求政府对于暗害志愿军的奸商——祖国的叛徒，给予最严厉的法律制裁！
    北京机器厂  李维廉
