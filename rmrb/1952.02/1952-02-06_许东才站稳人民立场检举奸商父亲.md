    Xu Dongcai Stands Firm on the People's Standpoint and Exposes His Unscrupulous Merchant Father

    To the Editor: My father, Xu Wenying, is the manager of the Xu Ji Iron Factory in the Eighth District. I know that my father has engaged in activities such as creating false accounts, evading taxes, and cutting corners on materials and workmanship. When this movement started, I urged him to confess. But he ignored me. I knew he should take the path of self-criticism and exposure. At first, I had ideological concerns, fearing that if I exposed him, he would make things difficult for me; and I was also afraid that after exposing him, the factory would collapse. After repeated education from the leaders of the trade union, I understood. Thus, I finally exposed my father, who acts as an unscrupulous merchant. Xu Dongcai

    许东才站稳人民立场检举奸商父亲
    编辑同志：我父亲许文英是第八区许记铁工厂的经理。我知道我父亲有造假账、偷税、偷工减料的行为。这次运动一开始，我就动员他坦白。但他不理我。我知道他应该走检举的道路。起初，我有思想顾虑，怕检举了他，他和我过不去；又怕把他检举后，工厂要垮。经过工会领导方面的一再教育，我想通了。这样，我终于检举了我的作奸商的父亲。  许东才
