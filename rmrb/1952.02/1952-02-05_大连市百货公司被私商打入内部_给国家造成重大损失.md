    Dalian Department Store
    Infiltrated by Private Merchants
    Causing Major Losses to the State
    Due to bureaucracy on the part of its leadership, the Dalian Department Store was infiltrated by unscrupulous merchants who, colluding from within, wantonly stole state property, embezzled or misappropriated public funds, stole state economic intelligence, and engaged in speculation and profiteering activities, causing significant losses to the state.
    Ninety-two percent of the store's sales personnel were introduced by unscrupulous merchants, directly or indirectly, through various planned methods. Among them were professional thieves, Kuomintang members under surveillance, prostitutes, hooligans, and unscrupulous merchants, with extremely complex backgrounds. The store leadership, without thorough understanding and investigation of these individuals, casually hired them. For three years, several key commodity groups within the store had been controlled by unscrupulous merchants. For example, the head of the watch and clock group, Zhao Tongzheng, was the owner of a private watch shop. The store leadership, believing he possessed "expertise," not only recruited him but also agreed to two conditions he set: (1) not to attend any meetings; (2) not to participate in any study sessions. After joining the Dalian Department Store, Zhao Tongzheng first repaired the old watches from his own shop and sold them to the store or replaced the store's new watches with them. On one occasion, when the store received a batch of new watches without a price set, he set the price very low and informed his counterparts to buy them up as soon as possible, then sold them in Lushun, making a profit of fifty percent on each watch. He manipulated the price of watches in the Dalian market and kept his counterparts informed of the store's price dynamics at all times. Because the company had spies sent by private merchants, the news of state price adjustments was often leaked in advance. For example, when the price of sanitary underwear was adjusted in August 1951, the price list sent to Jin County was taken to Lushun, resulting in a three-day delay in the price adjustment of sanitary underwear in Jin County. Private merchants exploited the loophole, causing the state to lose 16 million RMB. Similarly, when the news of the watch price increase was leaked, the watches were snapped up before the price increase.
    To steal state property and manipulate market prices, these unscrupulous merchants also used despicable means to win over and corrupt revolutionary cadres. In addition to giving gifts and hosting banquets, they more maliciously enticed cadres to invest in their businesses. Among the eleven cadres at the section chief level and above in the Dalian Department Store, eight were colluding with private merchants and had fallen into the mire of corruption and degeneration. For example, the store manager, Peng Shijie, and the deputy section chief of the storage and transportation section, Xue Yiren, became shareholders in the private Sanxinghang agency.
    Currently, relevant departments in Dalian are rectifying the company, thoroughly purging the internal elements, in order to drive out the unscrupulous merchants who have infiltrated the state-owned economic sector, purify the internal structure of state-owned commerce, and protect the interests of the state and the people.

### 大连市百货公司被私商打入内部  给国家造成重大损失

    大连市百货公司  
    被私商打入内部  
    给国家造成重大损失
    大连市百货公司由于领导方面的官僚主义，被奸商打入公司内部，里应外合，恣意盗卖国家财物，贪污或挪用公款，盗窃国家经济情报，进行投机倒把活动，给国家造成了重大损失。
    这个公司的营业人员，百分之九十二是奸商有计划地用各种方法直接或间接介绍来的。其中有职业小偷、被管制的国民党员、妓女、流氓、奸商等等，成份极为复杂。公司领导方面对这些人不经过深刻的了解和审查，就随便录用。三年来，公司几个主要的商品小组一直被奸商掌握着。如：钟表组的组长赵同政是一个私营表店的掌柜。公司领导方面认为他有“技术”，不仅吸收他参加工作，竟还同意他提出的两个条件：（一）不参加任何会议；（二）不参加学习。赵同政来到大连百货公司后，首先就将他自己店中的旧表修理一番，卖给公司或盗换公司的新表，有一次，公司到了一批新表，没有订价，他便将价格订的很低，并通知同行尽先去买，然后拿到旅顺出卖，转手之间，每只表赢利百分之五十。他一方面操纵着大连市场的表价，一方面把在公司里面了解的物价动态随时通知同行。由于公司内部有了私商派进来的奸细，国家调整物价的消息经常事先泄露出去。如一九五一年八月调整卫生衣的价格时，寄给金县的价格表却被带到旅顺去，因此，金县卫生衣的价格晚调整三天，私商饱钻空子，使国家损失人民币一千六百万元。又如手表涨价的消息被泄露了，在涨价前夕，手表就被争购一空。
    这些奸商为了盗窃国家财产、操纵市场物价，他们还用卑鄙手段拉拢、腐蚀革命干部。除了送礼、请客外，他们更恶毒地拉拢干部入股。大连百货公司科长以上的干部十一人，竟有八人与私商勾结，堕入贪污腐化的泥坑。如公司经理彭世傑和储运科副科长薛义仁就成了私营三省行代理店的股东。
    现在，大连有关部门正在整顿这个公司，彻底清洗内部，以便将潜入国营经济部门的奸商赶出去，以纯洁国营商业的内部，保护国家和人民的利益。
