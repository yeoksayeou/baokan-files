    [Our Newspaper's Report] The Central-South Military and Political Committee held an enlarged administrative meeting on February 16th. The meeting announced the decisions to give Wuhan Municipal People's Government Mayor Wu Defeng, People's Supervisory Committee Director Xie Bangzhi, and Deputy Mayor and Public Security Bureau Director Zhu Dixin the disciplinary actions of removal from office and demerit recording, respectively. These decisions have been submitted to the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council for approval and record. At the meeting, Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, also announced the decision to submit a request to appoint Li Xiannian, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial People's Government, to concurrently serve as Mayor of Wuhan Municipal People's Government, Wang Renzhong, former Vice Chairman of the Hubei Provincial People's Government, to be transferred to serve as Deputy Mayor of Wuhan Municipal People's Government, Wang Kewen, former Deputy Director of the Finance Department of the Hubei Provincial People's Government, to be transferred to serve as Secretary-General of Wuhan Municipal People's Government, and Wang Shixun, former member of the Wuhan Municipal People's Supervisory Committee, to be promoted to Director of the Committee. The meeting was presided over by Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Committee. First, Qian Ying, Minister of the Personnel Department of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, reported on the course of Zhou Jifang, former Deputy Mayor of Wuhan Municipal People's Government, and Song Ying, former Deputy Director of the Municipal People's Government Health Bureau, suppressing democracy, infringing upon human rights, retaliating under false pretenses, and plotting to frame Ji Kaifu, and other issues, and put forward opinions on the handling of Wu Defeng, Xie Bangzhi, Zhu Dixin, and others who committed serious errors in handling this case. The meeting immediately launched a heated discussion, and many members unanimously pointed out in their speeches that the correct handling of this incident more fully illustrates the great spirit of the Communist Party and the People's Government being selfless and impartial, hating evil as an enemy, being seriously responsible to the people, and sincerely serving the people.
    Chen Mingshu, Minister of the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Central-South Military and Political Committee and Standing Committee Member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: Song Ying and Zhou Jifang's illegal acts of suppressing democracy and infringing upon human rights are already known throughout the country. We are very satisfied with the Communist Party and the People's Government's giving them the disciplinary sanctions they deserve and the sanctions of national law. Regarding the handling of the mistakes made by Wu Defeng and others, he agreed with Qian Ying's suggestion. Huang Qixiang, Minister of the Department of Justice of the Central-South Military and Political Committee and Central Committee Member of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said: The punishment of the mistakes made by Wu Defeng and others is clear evidence that the People's Government protects democracy, protects human rights, and serves the people wholeheartedly. Pan Zinian, Minister of the Education Department of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, said: The punishment of Wu Defeng and others fully illustrates the Communist Party and the People's Government's spirit of great impartiality, that is, even old Party members, old cadres, and those who have made achievements in their work will not be tolerated or favored if they make mistakes. The Communist Party and the People's Government under the leadership of the Communist Party are absolutely responsible for the cause of the people. Only in this way can the Communist Party lead the people and help the democratic parties, and lead the entire people to complete victory. Li Xuefeng, Director of the Political and Legal Committee of the Central-South Military and Political Committee and Second Deputy Secretary of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, said after analyzing the root causes of the errors: The handling of the errors made by Wu Defeng and others must be understood from the responsibilities and tasks of the People's Government, that is, no staff member can violate laws and regulations, and no one can commit the mistake of bureaucratism. Only through the handling of these mistakes will the nature and responsibilities of the People's Government under the leadership of the Communist Party become more distinct. This also educates our Party members that they must study Marxism-Leninism, must implement the Party's policies and lines, and must abide by Party discipline and national laws.
    After the speeches at the meeting, Wu Defeng and Zhu Dixin expressed their sincere acceptance of the punishment and made self-criticisms, determined to correct their mistakes.
    Finally, Vice Chairman Deng Zihui made a conclusion on the discussion at the meeting. He pointed out: The reason why Wu Defeng and others made mistakes was due to subjectivism in their thinking methods and sectarianism in organization, coupled with audacity and recklessness in their actions, disregard for organization, and disregard for discipline, which eventually developed into administrative suppression of democracy and legal infringement of human rights. As a result, a serious, outrageous, and criminal conspiracy to frame people was created. It had an extremely bad influence on the people, and the prestige of the Party and the People's Government suffered major losses. He emphasized: The Central-South Military and Political Committee's handling of Zhou Jifang and Song Ying, as well as the punishment of Wu Defeng, Xie Bangzhi, Zhu Dixin, and others, is completely correct. If we don't do this, we will be unkind to the people and irresponsible to the Party and the revolution.
    [Another Dispatch] The newly appointed Mayor of Wuhan Municipal People's Government, Li Xiannian, and Deputy Mayor Wang Renzhong, have already arrived and assumed their posts on the 19th. The Wuhan Municipal People's Government held a welcoming meeting.

    中南军政委员会举行行政会议扩大会议
    宣布处分吴德峰谢邦治朱涤新
    并呈请任命李先念兼武汉市人民政府市长
    【本报讯】中南军政委员会在二月十六日举行行政会议扩大会议。会议宣布了分别给予武汉市人民政府市长吴德峰、人民监察委员会主任谢邦治及副市长兼公安总局局长朱涤新以撤职和记过处分的决定。这一决定已呈请中央人民政府政务院同意和备案。会上，中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢并宣布决定呈请任命湖北省人民政府主席李先念兼任武汉市人民政府市长、原湖北省人民政府副主席王任重调任武汉市人民政府副市长、原湖北省人民政府财政厅副厅长王克文调任武汉市人民政府秘书长、原武汉市人民监察委员会委员王世勋提任该会主任。会议在中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢主持下进行。首先由中南军政委员会人事部部长钱瑛报告前武汉市人民政府副市长周季方、前市人民政府卫生局副局长宋瑛压制民主，侵犯人权和借端报复，阴谋陷害纪凯夫等的经过，并提出对于处理这一案件时犯有严重错误的吴德峰、谢邦治、朱涤新等的处理意见。会议当即展开热烈的讨论，许多委员在发言中一致指出：这一事件的正确处理，更充分说明了共产党和人民政府大公无私、疾恶如仇，对人民严肃负责和真诚为人民服务的伟大精神。
    中南军政委员会农林部部长、中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员陈铭枢说：宋瑛、周季方压制民主，侵犯人权的犯法行为，已是全国皆知。共产党和人民政府对他们予以应得的党纪处分和国法制裁，我们感到非常满意。关于吴德峰等所犯错误的处理，他同意钱瑛的建议。中南军政委员会司法部部长、农工民主党中央委员黄琪翔说：对吴德峰等所犯错误的处分，就是人民政府保护民主、保护人权和全心全意为人民办事的明证。中南军政委员会教育部部长潘梓年说：对吴德峰等的处分，充分说明了共产党和人民政府的大公无私的精神，即是老党员、老干部、工作有成绩，犯了错误也毫不姑息、毫不偏袒。共产党和共产党领导下的人民政府，对于人民事业是绝对负责任的，只有这样，共产党才能领导人民和帮助各民主党派，并率领全体人民走向完全的胜利。中南军政委员会政治法律委员会主任、中共中央中南局第二副书记李雪峰在分析发生错误的根源后说：对于吴德峰等所犯错误的处理，必须从人民政府的职责和任务上加以理解，这就是任何工作人员都不能违法乱纪，都不能犯官僚主义的错误。只有通过对这些错误的处理，共产党领导下的人民政府的性质与职责，才会更加鲜明起来。这也教育我们的党员必须学习马克思列宁主义，必须执行党的政策路线，必须遵守党纪国法。
    大会发言完毕，吴德峰和朱涤新表示诚恳接受处分，并作了自我批评，决心改正错误。
    最后，邓子恢副主席对会议的讨论，作了结论。他指出：吴德峰等所以犯错误，是由于思想方法上的主观主义和组织上的宗派主义，更加上行动上的胆大妄为，目无组织，目无纪律，最后就发展到行政上的压制民主，法律上的侵犯人权。以致造成了严重的、伤天害理的、有重大罪行的阴谋陷害案。给予人民群众以极坏的影响，使党和人民政府的威信受到了重大损失。他强调指出：中南军政委员会对于周季方、宋瑛的处理，以及给予吴德峰、谢邦治、朱涤新等以处分，是完全正确的。不这样作，我们就对人民不仁，对党对革命不负责任。
    【又讯】新任武汉市人民政府市长李先念、副市长王任重已在十九日先行到职视事，武汉市人民政府举行了欢迎会。
