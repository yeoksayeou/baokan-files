Employees of Beijing Municipal Cotton, Yarn, and Fabric Company
    Offer Rationalization Proposals for Cotton Fabric Yarn Supply
    Saving the State a Significant Fortune
    Editor: In the past, when the Beijing Municipal Cotton, Yarn, and Fabric Company exchanged cotton yarn with weaving and dyeing factories for cotton fabric, there was serious waste. Employees of the company studied this matter and put forward rationalization proposals. After correcting the waste, the state saved a significant fortune. When the company commissioned weaving and dyeing factories to weave cloth, the original standard for yarn supply was 22 strands of 20-count yarn for one bolt of "August 1st" white shirting (plus labor costs). However, in reality, the cotton yarn needed for each bolt of "August 1st" cloth was no more than 21.75 strands. After studying anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, all employees, based on actual investigation and research, made a rationalization proposal to the company's leading cadres to "reduce the amount of yarn supplied and save wealth for the country." The company selected two private factories (one a power loom factory and the other a hand loom factory) for testing. The results showed that the amount of yarn required for each bolt of "August 1st" cloth did not exceed 21.74 strands. This proved that the Beijing Municipal Cotton, Yarn, and Fabric Company had indeed supplied too much yarn in the past when commissioning weaving and dyeing factories to weave cloth. In early January of this year, the company, together with the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, convened representatives of the Weaving and Dyeing Industry Association to jointly study the matter. Based on actual facts, the representatives were informed, and the thinking of some factories that sought exorbitant profits was corrected. The representatives expressed their willingness to accept a reduction of 0.25 strands from the original yarn supply standard for each bolt of "August 1st" cloth.

    北京市花纱布分公司职工
    提出棉布供纱量的合理化建议
    给国家节省了一大笔财富
    编辑同志：北京市花纱布分公司过去用棉纱和织染业工厂交换棉布时，有严重的浪费现象。公司职工对这件事进行钻研，提出了合理化建议，纠正浪费现象后，给国家节省了一大笔财富。分公司在委
    托织染业工厂织布时，原定供纱标准为一匹“八
    一”白细布，供二十支纱二十二支（另付工缴费），但实际上每匹“八一”布所需要的棉纱，最多不过二一点七五支。全体职工在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义学习后，根据实际调查研究，向公司领导干部提出“减少供纱量，替国家节省财富”的合理化建议。公司选择了两个私营工厂（一家是电力机工厂，另一家是人力机工厂）进行试验，结果每匹“八一”布所需纱的数量，都没有超出二一点七四支。这证明北京市花纱布公司在过去委托织染工厂织布时，供纱确系过高。公司在今年一月上旬，会同市工商局召集了织染业同业公会代表共同研究，以实际事实向代表们说明，纠正了某些工厂贪图暴利的思想。各代表纷纷表示，愿意接受按原来每匹“八一”布供纱量标准，减少零点二五支。    巫德华
