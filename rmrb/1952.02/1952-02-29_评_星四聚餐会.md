    The spokesmen for the bourgeoisie say, "The bourgeoisie has neither army nor weapons, how can it be said that they are attacking the people's democratic regime?" This fallacy is gradually disappearing. Because countless facts have proven that the bourgeoisie has already launched, and is continuing, a rampant attack on the people's democratic regime nationwide. Faced with these ironclad facts, the bourgeois spokesmen were then forced to change their tune and say, "Alright, even if it is an attack! The bourgeoisie is just a disorganized mess, surely it's not an organized, planned attack!" However, ironclad facts have once again irrefutably shattered this nonsense. The bourgeoisie's attack is not only organized, but also meticulously organized. The "Star Four Dinner Party" discovered in Chongqing is a significant example.
    The "Star Four Dinner Party" was a command organization composed of a group of well-known capitalists in Chongqing, launching a large-scale attack on the country's economic endeavors. The organization of this structure was very tight. The capitalists of Chongqing's private steel industry first initiated the organization, and then, with it as the core, established "Star Five Dinner Party," "Star Six Dinner Party," "Shipbuilding Group," "Eleven Factories Liaison Office," and "Accountants' Forum" and other organizations. All the capitalists participating in these illegal organizations had to accept its "tests" and abide by its "discipline." It frequently convened "business meetings" to "summarize experiences and deploy tasks" so that all its members could attack the state under unified command.
    Their organized large-scale attack was targeted at the vital sectors of the national economy. Everyone knows that the steel industry is the "mother of industry," therefore,
    all the criminal activities of the capitalists of the "Star Four Dinner Party" were aimed at Chongqing's steel industry, the center of the Southwest's steel industry. Everyone knows that the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is of great significance to the economic construction, national defense construction, and the economic life of the local people in the Southwest, therefore, this group of capitalists specifically established an organization - the "Star Five Dinner Party" - to monopolize the processing orders for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. Everyone knows that ships are the main means of transportation in the Southwest region, therefore, the "Star Four Dinner Party" specifically established the "Shipbuilding Group" in an attempt to monopolize the shipbuilding industry in the Southwest region. Everyone knows that the establishment and development of the textile industry in the Southwest region is of great importance to the lives of the people in the Southwest, therefore, the "Star Four Dinner Party" established the "Eleven Factories Liaison Office" to monopolize the processing orders for textile machinery. As a result of such focused and purposeful large-scale activities, the "Star Four Dinner Party" developed into a monopoly organization and a large-scale theft group of the bourgeoisie in the Southwest region in a short period of time; its membership rapidly increased two or three times. This theft group launched a rampant, organized, and planned attack on the people's democratic regime, usurped the leadership of certain national economic organs, and caused serious losses to the country.
    In order to create a coordinated situation for attacking state organs from both inside and outside, the "Star Four Dinner Party" used the methods of "sending in" and especially "pulling over" to deploy a large-scale "spy network" within state organs. In order to attack the state-owned steel industry, it bribed the subcontracting engineers of state-owned factories, as well as the deputy director of the Chongqing Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau and the personnel of the Managerial Office of the Industry Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee, who supervised the processing and ordering business. In order to steal the engineering funds of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway under construction, it bribed the deputy director of the Machinery Department of the Southwest Railway Bureau. In order to attack the state-owned shipbuilding industry, it bribed the chief of the Inspection Section of the Shipping Bureau. Relying on these "spies," it obtained the power to "uniformly allocate" processing and ordering tasks, thereby planning and uniformly raising labor costs and material costs, skimping on materials and workmanship, delaying delivery dates, and even arrogantly demanding that the state fill out forms and report to it on "the planned shipbuilding plans," "otherwise, member factories will refuse to repair and build." These audacious capitalists manipulated everything and did whatever they wanted.
    After this bourgeois theft group gained economic development, it also increasingly sought important positions in politics and rapidly began its political offensive. It gradually used deceptive methods to manipulate the Chongqing Iron and Steel Machinery Industry Association as a tool, and even dared to "designate" the representatives of industry and commerce to attend the Chongqing Municipal People's Congress. It had long since transformed from an economic monopoly organization and a theft group into a group of political careerists, launching a planned two-pronged attack, economic and political, against the people's democratic state. This shows that the purpose of this group of bourgeois careerists in forming such a monopoly and theft group, manipulating everything and doing whatever they wanted, was to place the state-owned economy under the control of private capital economically and to make the people's government obey the leadership of the bourgeoisie politically. They verbally supported the Common Program, but in reality, they tried every possible means to undermine it. The illegal existence of the "Star Four Dinner Party" and its illegal activities fully revealed the reactionary nature and sinister intentions of the bourgeoisie. The bourgeoisie is driven by profit, so they are bound to harm others to benefit themselves, harm the public to benefit the private; they are bound to take measures that are harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and damage the interests of the state and the people in order to satisfy their selfish and self-interested purpose of expanding their private property. However, under the people's democratic regime, their selfish activities cannot be carried out as they please, and they are subject to a certain degree of restriction. In order to achieve their selfish and self-interested goals, the bourgeoisie tried every possible means to break this restriction, and ambitiously displayed their expertise in monopoly manipulation, speculation, and fraud, doing their utmost to ingratiate themselves, steal, and usurp state economic rights and interests, attempting to drag our country onto the decadent capitalist road. Is it not extremely obvious that the bourgeoisie wanted to illegally organize the "Star Four Dinner Party" and the like for this purpose?
    Organizations similar to the "Star Four Dinner Party" also exist in other parts of the country. They generally control the Federation of Industry and Commerce and trade associations, organizing institutions such as "dinner parties," "forums," "joint production offices," and "cooperative societies," using these institutions as a front to launch rampant attacks on the state. Some monopoly organizations have even openly squeezed out state-owned enterprises and cooperatives. These monopoly organizations extensively bribe cadres, pulling them into their criminal groups, allowing them to systematically steal state economic intelligence, in order to cooperate from the inside and outside, evade taxes on a large scale, skimp on materials and workmanship, and steal state property.
    At the same time, this kind of bourgeois monopoly group and theft group is also very harmful to legitimate private enterprises. Because the reason why they want to organize such a monopoly group is to try to obtain exclusive economic benefits, which is also a common characteristic of all capitalist monopoly organizations. What they are striving for is the goal of benefiting themselves, and they cannot benefit themselves without harming others, so they must concentrate their efforts on launching a large-scale attack on the state; at the same time, they often squeeze each other and harm each other, "the big fish eats the small fish." Many small and medium-sized iron factories in Chongqing have either been squeezed out by the "Star Four Dinner Party" or have been annexed by it. The leading figures who instructed the "Star Four Dinner Party" to attack the state, such as Gao Gongmao, the director of the Minsheng Machinery Factory, which belongs to the Minsheng Shipping Company and has more than a thousand workers, and Li Zhiqin, the manager of the Yuxin Steel Factory, which has more than 1,200 workers, started out by harming others and pursuing exorbitant profits. This is also the "secret" of the "entrepreneurship" of the "predecessors" of all bourgeois, both domestic and foreign. Now we have seen that Gao Gongmao, Li Zhiqin and others have long become important figures of the bourgeoisie with great "reputation" in the Southwest region of our country. After they squeezed out and annexed many small and medium-sized factories, their capital became more abundant, and the means of attacking the state became more vicious. This is very obvious. Therefore, the bourgeois monopoly group and theft group like the "Star Four Dinner Party" are not only the ferocious enemies of our country and all the people, but also the enemies of all law-abiding industrialists and businessmen.
    The facts before us have not only fully proved that the bourgeoisie has launched a rampant attack on the people's democratic regime for the past three years, but also proved that this attack has been carried out in an organized and planned manner. If their ultimate goal of the attack is realized, then our people's democratic regime will be in serious danger of changing its nature. In the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, skimping on materials and workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence, the reason why we must track down all the bourgeois monopoly groups and theft groups and resolutely counterattack them lies here.

### 评“星四聚餐会”

    评“星四聚餐会”
    资产阶级的代言人说：“资产阶级一无军队，二无武器，那里说得上向人民民主政权进攻呢？”这种谬论，现在是逐渐消声匿迹了。因为无数事实已经证明，资产阶级在全国范围内早已发动了并且还在继续着对人民民主政权的猖狂进攻。面对着这种铁的事实，资产阶级代言人于是被迫地变换了一种腔调说：“好了，就算是进攻吧！资产阶级却是一盘散沙呀，总不会是有组织、有计划地进攻吧！”然而，铁的事实终于又不容置辩地粉碎了这种胡说。资产阶级的进攻不仅是有组织的，而且是有严密组织的。重庆发现的“星四聚餐会”就是一个显著的例证。
    “星四聚餐会”是重庆的一批著名的资本家所组成的向国家经济事业大举进攻的指挥机构。这个机构的组织是十分严密的。重庆私营钢铁业的资本家首先发起组织了这个机构，然后以它为核心，又设立了“星五聚餐会”、“星六聚餐会”、“造船小组”、“十一厂联络处”和“会计师座谈会”等组织。所有参加这些非法组织的资本家，都要接受它的“考验”，遵守它的“纪律”。它经常召开“业务会议”，以“总结经验，布置任务”，以便使它所有的成员，在统一的指挥之下，向国家进攻。
    他们有组织地大举进攻的目标是国家经济的要害部门。谁都知道钢铁工业是“工业之母”，因此，
    “星四聚餐会”的资本家们的一切犯罪活动，都对准了西南区钢铁工业的中心——重庆钢铁业来进行。谁都知道成渝铁路对于西南区的经济建设、国防建设和当地人民经济生活具有重大意义，因此，这一群资本家又专门成立了一个机构——“星五聚餐会”，垄断了成渝铁路的加工定货。谁都知道船舶是西南区当前主要的交通工具，因此，“星四聚餐会”又专门成立了“造船小组”，企图垄断西南区的造船业。谁都知道在西南区创办和发展纺织工业，对于西南人民生活具有重要作用，因此，“星四聚餐会”又成立了“十一厂联络处”，垄断了纺织机械的加工定货。这样有重点、有目的地大肆活动的结果，就使“星四聚餐会”在短短的期间，发展成为西南地区资产阶级的垄断组织和大规模的盗窃集团；它的成员迅速增加了两三倍。这个盗窃集团，向人民民主政权展开了有组织有计划的猖狂进攻，篡夺了某些国家经济机关的领导权，给国家造成了严重的损失。
    为了造成对国家机关进攻的里应外合的形势，“星四聚餐会”用“派进来”特别是“拉过去”的办法，在国家机关内部布置了大规模的“坐探网”。为了进攻国营钢铁工业，它收买了国营工厂的外包工程师，收买了监督加工定货业务的重庆市人民政府工商局副局长和西南军政委员会工业部经理处的人员。为了盗窃正在修建中的成渝铁路的工程经费，它收买了西南铁路局机务处副处长。为了进攻国营造船业，它收买了航务局检查科科长。依靠这些“坐探”，它取得了“统一分配”加工定货任务的大权，从而有计划地、统一地抬高工价和材料费，偷工减料，拖延交货日期，甚至狂妄地要国家向它填表报告“拟定中的造船计划”，“否则各会员厂拒绝修造”。这些胆大包天的资本家，就这样地操纵一切，为所欲为了。
    这个资产阶级的盗窃集团，在经济上获得了发展之后，在政治上也日益猎取重要地位，并且迅速开始了它的政治进攻。它逐渐地用欺骗方法，操纵了重庆钢铁机器业同业公会为工具，并且公然敢于
    “圈定”出席重庆市人民代表会议的工商界代表。它早已从一个经济垄断的组织和盗窃集团，进一步变成为一个政治野心家的集团，有计划地向人民民主国家进行经济的和政治的双管齐下的进攻了。这说明了这一班资产阶级的野心家们，组成这样的垄断和盗窃集团，操纵一切、无所不为的目的，就是在经济上要把国营经济置于私人资本的控制之下，在政治上企图使人民政府服从资产阶级的领导。他们口头上拥护共同纲领，实际上却千方百计地破坏共同纲领。 “星四聚餐会”的非法存在和它的非法活动，充分地显露了资产阶级的反动本质和罪恶用心。资产阶级是唯利是图的，因此他们必然要损人利己，损公利私；必然要采取有害于国计民生的手段，损害国家和人民的利益，以满足他们扩大私有财产的自私自利的目的。但是，在人民民主政权之下，他们自私自利的活动是不能畅所欲为的，是要受到一定程度的限制的。资产阶级为了自私自利的目的，千方百计地企图打破这种限制，并且野心勃勃地施展他们所擅长的垄断操纵、投机欺诈的惯技，极力钻营，盗窃和篡夺国家经济权益，企图把我们的国家拉上腐朽的资本主义的道路去。资产阶级所以要非法组织“星四聚餐会”等，其目的就在这里，这难道不是极明显的吗？
    类似“星四聚餐会”这样的组织，在全国其他各地同样存在。它们一般地都把持着工商业联合会、同业公会，组织“聚餐会”、“座谈会”、“联合生产处”、“联营社”等机构，以这些机构为阵地，向国家猖狂进攻。有些垄断组织，甚至公然把国家企业与合作社挤垮了。这些垄断组织，大规模地向干部行贿，把他们拉入自己的犯罪集团，让他们有计划地盗窃国家经济情报，以便里应外合，大量地偷税漏税，偷工减料，盗窃国家财产。
    同时，这种资产阶级的垄断集团和盗窃集团，对于正当的私营企业也是为害很大的。因为他们所以要组织这样的垄断集团，就是企图取得独占的经济利益，这也是一切资本主义的垄断组织的共同特性。他们所极力追求的是利己的目的，而不损人是不能利己的，所以他们要集中力量向国家大举进攻；同时也经常互相倾榨，彼此坑害，“大鱼吃小鱼”。重庆许多中小铁工厂，有的已被“星四聚餐会”挤垮了，有的被它并吞了。在“星四聚餐会”中发纵指使向国家进攻的首脑分子，如民生轮船公司所属的拥有一千多工人的民生机器厂厂长高功懋和拥有一千二百多工人的渝鑫钢铁厂经理李志亲等，就是依靠坑害别人和追逐暴利起家的。这也是中外一切资产阶级的“先辈”们“创业”的秘密。现在我们所看到的高功懋李志亲等人早已成为我国西南地区很有“资望”的资产阶级的重要人物。他们排挤和并吞了许多中小工厂之后，资本愈雄厚，向国家的进攻的手段也愈毒辣。这是非常明显的了。因此，像“星四聚餐会”这样的资产阶级的垄断集团和盗窃集团，不但是我们的国家和全体人民的凶恶的敌人，而且也是一切守法的工商业家的敌人。
    摆在我们面前的事实，不仅已经完全证明了资产阶级三年来对于人民民主政权发动了猖狂的进攻，而且证明了这种进攻是有组织、有计划地进行的。他们进攻的最后目的如果实现，那末，我们的人民民主政权就有变质的严重危险。在反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗窃国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报的斗争中，我们所以必须把资产阶级的垄断集团和盗窃集团全部追查出来，予以坚决的反击，理由就在这里。
