    People's Bank of China Headquarters and Three Directly Subordinate Units
    Capture Fourteen Major Corrupt Officials in Ten Days
    Concentrating Efforts to Pursue and Strike, Another Ten Major Corrupt Officials Discovered
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] Following the upsurge in the anti-corruption struggle at the People's Bank of China Headquarters and its three directly subordinate units—the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the People's Insurance Company of China—which began on January 19th with a concentrated attack on major corrupt officials, fourteen major corrupt officials who had directly embezzled over 100 million yuan or masterminded the theft of over 100 million yuan of state property were captured within ten days, from the 19th to the 29th of January. The masses at the People's Bank of China Headquarters and its three directly subordinate units pursued their victories, and by February 2nd, had discovered ten more major corrupt officials. Among them, three, after attending the Beijing public trial of major corrupt officials, recognized that honest confession was the only way out and successively confessed their crimes. The other criminals are currently under surveillance and investigation.
    These major corrupt officials can be roughly divided into three categories based on their methods of stealing state assets: The first category consists of criminals responsible for procurement work at state banks who colluded with unscrupulous merchants, engaged in corruption and embezzlement, and jointly stole state assets. There are nine such corrupt officials. These include Li Xiangting (purchasing agent, Printing Bureau of the People's Bank of China Headquarters), Zhao Kungang (same as above), Jin Tongzhi (formerly worked with Zhao Kungang and conspired to steal, currently head of the Waste Materials Section of the Beijing People's Printing Factory), Ma Jingxiu (buyer, General Affairs Department of the People's Bank of China Headquarters), Gu Chengde (staff member, General Affairs Section of the People's Insurance Company of China), and Shen Xihong (technician, General Affairs Department of the People's Bank of China Headquarters). Their direct embezzlement and bribery resulted in a loss of approximately 2.5 billion yuan in state property. Li Xiangting and others, colluding with unscrupulous merchants like Lu Huimin, embezzled state materials, arbitrarily increased prices, and sought exorbitant profits, stealing nearly one billion yuan of state assets. Zhao Kungang committed eighteen acts of embezzlement, large and small, and the embezzled funds and materials, according to preliminary statistics, amount to approximately 500 million yuan. Ma Jingxiu, simply in colluding with unscrupulous merchant Bian Lanbo (manager of Baofeng Paper Company) and allowing the merchant to underreport the amount of paper sold to the state, caused the state to suffer a loss of over 100 million yuan. Gu Chengde, when handling the printing of transport insurance policies, employed the trick of substituting inferior goods (estimating prices based on typing paper while using thin Taiyuan paper instead), causing the state to lose 140 million yuan in one instance.
    The second category of major corrupt officials consists of unscrupulous merchants who infiltrated the bank. There are two such corrupt officials. One of them, over the past three years, has stolen state economic intelligence eighteen times, thereby repeatedly obtaining illegal profits and causing huge losses to the state, which are currently being calculated.
    In addition, there is a third category of major corrupt officials whose main crime is concealing large quantities of enemy and puppet assets received. There are three such corrupt officials. These include Gao Zhongyu (staff member, Financial Management Department of the People's Bank of China Headquarters) and Li Shuzi (staff member, Currency Management Department of the People's Bank of China Headquarters), who concealed assets totaling over 2.1 billion yuan. Gao Zhongyu alone concealed 930 taels of gold (worth approximately 800 million yuan).
    According to the experience of the People's Bank of China Headquarters in mobilizing the masses to capture this group of major corrupt elements, in addition to paying special attention to checking for corrupt elements in the purchasing departments with large expenditures and the departments managing large quantities of materials within state financial institutions, we should also pay close attention to checking for corrupt elements in the pseudo-financial institutions that possessed large amounts of assets during the initial period of liberation.

    人民银行总行和直属三个单位
    十天捕获大贪污犯十四名
    集中力量乘胜追击又发现十个大贪污犯
    【本报讯】中国人民银行总行和直属中国银行、交通银行、中国人民保险公司三个单位的反贪污斗争，从一月十九日进入向大贪污犯实行围攻的高潮后，在十九日到二十九日十天内，集中力量捕获了直接贪污一亿元以上和主谋盗取国家财产一亿元以上的大贪污犯十四名。人民银行总行和直属三个单位的群众并乘胜追击，到二月二日为止，继续发现大贪污犯十名。其中三名在参加北京公审大贪污犯大会以后，认识到坦白交代才是唯一的出路，陆续自动供出罪恶事实。其他各犯正在被监视追查中。
    这些大贪污犯，根据他们盗窃国家资财的手段大致可以分为三类：一类是担负国家银行的采购工作，利用职务的方便和奸商相勾结，贪污舞弊，共同盗窃国家资财的罪犯。这类贪污犯有九名。如李祥庭（人民银行总行印制管理局采购员）、赵昆岗（同上）、金铜枝（原和赵昆岗在一起工作并同谋盗窃，现任北京人民印刷厂废料科科长）、马敬修（人民银行总行总务处采买员）、顾承德（中国人民保险公司总务科办事员）、沈熙宏（人民银行总行总务处技工）等，他们直接贪污和受贿，使国家招致损失的财产共约二十五亿余元。李祥庭等和奸商卢惠民等侵吞国家物资，任意加价，牟取暴利，前后盗窃了国家近十亿元的资财。赵昆岗大小贪污共十八次，贪污的款项和物资，据初步统计约五亿余元。马敬修仅在和奸商边岚波（宝丰纸行经理）勾结，听凭奸商在卖给国家纸张时以少报多一项事实中，就使国家遭受一亿元以上的损失。顾承德在经手印制运输保险单时，玩弄抽梁换柱的手段（用打字纸估价，用太原薄纸顶充），一次就使国家受到一亿四千万元的损失。
    第二类大贪污犯是打入银行内部的奸商。这类大贪污犯有两名。其中一名，三年来先后盗窃国家经济情报十八次，因而在三年中屡获非法暴利，使国家遭受的巨大损失正计算中。
    此外还有一类大贪污犯，他们的主要罪行是隐匿大量接收的敌伪资财。这类贪污犯有三名。如高中域（人民银行总行金融管理处行员）、李树滋（人民银行总行货币管理处行员）等，他们隐匿资财总值达二十一亿余元。高中域一人隐匿的黄金就有九百三十两（约值八亿余元）。
    根据人民银行总行发动群众捕捉这批大贪污分子的经验证明，在国家金融机构中，除了对于开支大的采购物资部门和经管大量物资的部门，应特别注意检查贪污分子以外，对于解放之初接收时期拥有大量资财的伪金融机构，也应该严密注意检查贪污分子。
