Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 8th: The Hong Kong British authorities continue to persecute disaster victims in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City. At 9:00 PM on February 4th, the Hong Kong British authorities unreasonably arrested Liu Qin, the chief representative of the disaster victims' representative council in Kowloon, and deported Liu Qin at 8:00 AM on the 5th. During the detention, British police beat Liu Qin, causing chest injuries.

The incident aroused great anger among the disaster victims in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City. They said indignantly: "What exactly is the Hong Kong British government up to? Since the fire occurred two months ago, they have persecuted us in this way time and time again. Beating people, arresting people, and snatching away our relief supplies, who knows what kind of world Hong Kong has become?" The disaster victims' representative council in Tung Tau Tsuen, Kowloon City, has lodged a serious protest against a series of reactionary atrocities by the Hong Kong British government.

Liu Qin has returned to Guangzhou on the 6th and has received a warm welcome and care from people from all walks of life in Guangzhou.

    香港英政府反动暴行层出不穷
    竟继续迫害九龙我国灾民
    【新华社广州八日电】香港英国当局继续迫害九龙城东头村灾民。二月四日晚九时，香港英国当局又在九龙无理逮捕了灾民代表会的总代表刘勤，并在五日晨八时将刘勤驱逐出境。在拘禁时，英国警察曾将刘勤殴打致胸部受伤。
    这一事件发生后，激起了九龙城东头村灾民的极大愤怒，他们激愤地说：“香港英国政府究竟居心何在？自从火灾发生后两个月来，就这样三番四次地迫害我们。打人、抓人，抢走我们的救济品，真不知道香港成了个什么世界？”九龙城东头村灾民代表会对香港英国政府一连串的反动暴行，已提出严重抗议。
    刘勤已在六日返抵广州，受到广州各界人民的亲切欢迎和照顾。
