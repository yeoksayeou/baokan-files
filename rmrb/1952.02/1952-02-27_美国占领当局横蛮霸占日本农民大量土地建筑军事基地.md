Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 25th: The American occupiers, in order to build military bases in Japan, are tyrannically seizing large amounts of land and houses from the Japanese people. Many farmers who have been deprived of their farmland have been displaced as a result.

According to statistics in a white paper published by the All-Japan Special Procurement (Supply) Agency Labor Union, up to July 1, 1951, there were a total of 13,790 cases of land requisition from civilians by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, with approximately 111 million *ping* (one *ping* equals 3.3 square meters) of land requisitioned; there were 3,000 cases of house requisition, covering an area of approximately 1.36 million *ping*. The white paper also estimates that from July of last year to the end of March of this year, more than 65.3 million *ping* of land are planned to be requisitioned due to the U.S. military's stationing in Japan.

The U.S. occupation authorities adopted extremely tyrannical and unreasonable methods when requisitioning land from Japanese farmers. There was an intolerable example: One day, the village chief of Higashi-Akiru Village, Nishi-Tama County, Tokyo, was suddenly summoned by the occupation authorities. He was ordered to sit in a jeep and accompany the U.S. military on a ride around the site of the former Japanese military airfield, which had become farmland. The U.S. military immediately announced that it would "borrow" all the land within the circle the jeep had driven, and ordered all residents of the area to move out quickly within a short period. Despite the unanimous opposition of the local farmers, the U.S. occupation forces brazenly brought in weapons and built barracks there. As a result, two hundred residents from sixty-five families were displaced.

In some cases, when the U.S. military wanted to requisition land from Japanese farmers, they ordered the Japanese government to come forward and coerce the farmers into signing contracts promising the authorities "temporary use" of their land. However, even before the contract was formally signed, the farmers' land had already been flattened by U.S. military road rollers, and sometimes even covered with concrete. All growing crops in the fields were ruined.

The Japanese "Police Reserve Force," established under U.S. orders, is also plundering the land of Japanese farmers everywhere. This plundering is often carried out directly by the American commanders in the "Police Reserve Force."

Now the United States is attempting to use the U.S.-Japan "Administrative Agreement" to "legalize" its privilege of seizing Japanese people's land to build military bases. However, the broad masses of the Japanese people are angrily protesting the "Administrative Agreement" negotiations and opposing turning Japan into a U.S. military base. Even some Japanese local authorities have openly demanded that the United States return the occupied Japanese land and houses. On January 25, the governor of Kanagawa Prefecture and the mayor of Yokohama City, among others, jointly submitted a petition to Ridgway and Rusk, the U.S. representative negotiating the "Administrative Agreement," requesting the complete lifting of the "reception" by the U.S. military after the war of approximately 2.13 million *ping* of land and 200,000 *ping* of buildings in Yokohama City.

### 美国占领当局横蛮霸占日本农民大量土地建筑军事基地

    美国占领当局横蛮霸占日本农民大量土地建筑军事基地
    【新华社二十五日讯】东京消息：美国占领者为了在日本修建军事基地，横蛮地霸占日本人民的大量土地和房屋。许多被剥夺了耕地的农民因此流离失所。
    据日本全国特别调达（供应）厅职工会所发表的白皮书统计，到一九五一年七月一日为止，美、日反动派征用民间土地的事件共达一万三千七百九十起，被征用的土地约一亿一千一百万坪（一坪等于三点三平方公尺）；征用房屋事件三千起，以面积计约占地一百三十六万坪。又据该白皮书的估计，从去年七月起到今年三月底为止，因美军驻扎日本而准备征用的土地为六千五百三十多万坪。
    美国占领当局在征用日本农民的土地时，采取了极其横蛮无理的手段。曾经有过这样一个令人不能容忍的事例：有一天，东京西多摩郡东秋留村的村长突然被占领当局传去。他被命令坐在吉普车上，陪同美军乘车环绕已经成为农田的前日军飞机场的遗址兜了一圈。美军就立即宣布要“借用”吉普车所跑过的圈子中的全部土地，并限令该地所有居民在短期内迅速搬出。尽管当地的农民一致反对，美国占领军竟悍然运来武器，在那里建筑起营房，结果，六十五个家庭的二百个居民因此流离失所。
    在有些场合，美军要征用日本农民的土地时，就命令日本政府出面胁迫农民签订承诺当局“暂时使用”他们的土地的契约。但是，甚至在契约没有正式签字以前，农民的土地就已被美军的压路机压平，有时甚至被盖上了混凝土。田里一切成长的作物都被糟蹋了。
    根据美国的命令所建立的日本“警察后备队”，也在到处掠夺日本农民的土地。这种掠夺时常是由“警察后备队”中的美国指挥官直接出面进行的。
    现在美国正企图利用美日“行政协定”来使它霸占日本人民土地修建军事基地的特权“合法化”。但是，广大的日本人民正愤怒地抗议“行政协定”谈判，反对变日本为美国军事基地。甚至一部分日本地方当局也公开要求美国归还霸占的日本土地和房屋。一月二十五日，神奈川县知事和横滨市长等曾联名向李奇微和谈判 “行政协定”的美国代表鲁斯克提出请愿书，要求全面解除战后美军对横滨市的约二百十三万坪土地和占地二十万坪的建筑物的“接收”。
