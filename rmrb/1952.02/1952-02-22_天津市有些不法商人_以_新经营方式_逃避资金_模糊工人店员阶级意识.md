    Some Illegal Businessmen in Tianjin
    Evade Funds with "New Management Methods"
    Blur the Class Consciousness of Workers and Shop Assistants

    Editor: During my work in the anti-corruption and anti-bribery inspection team in Tianjin, some workers reported to me that many commercial firms had implemented so-called "new management methods" around the New Year and Spring Festival. The basic approach of this "new management method" is that capitalists withdraw most of their funds, leaving a very small amount for business operations. If the business goes well, labor and capital share the profits equally (even including a portion of the funds); if the business goes poorly, the shop is allowed to collapse. For example, the capitalist of Qifa Shun Restaurant in Tianjin's Second District, starting from January 1st of this year, withdrew most of the funds, leaving only thirty bags of flour (not even as much as two days' worth of turnover) as operating capital, and implemented the "new management method." The capitalist is in charge of the accounts, and the labor manages the cash. The capitalist extracts 60,000 yuan from the daily turnover as "family living allowance"; the labor (ten workers) extracts 77,000 yuan as wages. The remaining funds accumulated daily are used to extract 20% as "public accumulation fund" during the Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival, and the rest is divided equally between labor and capital. If the business is not good and needs to be supplemented with funds, labor and capital can borrow if they have the means; if they cannot borrow, then the business collapses. After the Spring Festival, the Huashun Fruit Shop in Nanshi, Tianjin, also implemented a "new management method" similar to that of Qifa Shun Restaurant. The capitalist withdrew most of the funds, leaving three bags of flour and fifty catties of oil as operating capital (approximately equal to one day's turnover in the past). The labor manages all the funds, and the capitalist only does some "street running" and "meeting" chores. However, in addition to extracting 10,000 yuan from the turnover daily as "family living allowance," the capitalist also extracts a "monthly allowance" worth one and a half bags of flour per month. If the business goes well in the future, the labor and capital will share the dividends equally; if the business goes poorly, the capitalist bears no responsibility and allows the shop to collapse.

    In Tianjin, the number of shops implementing the so-called "new management method" is no longer isolated. According to preliminary investigations, more than 100 households in the four industries of freight yards, bean food, fruit, and restaurants in Tianjin have implemented this method. I once asked several capitalists why they implemented this "new management method." They said, "You used to say that I kept black accounts and evaded taxes. Now I implement the new management method, the business is open, the workers manage it, production is developed, and labor and capital both benefit. This is all done according to the government's intentions." They made their act of evading funds sound very high-sounding!

    I feel that this situation is very serious. This is an illegal act by the bourgeoisie that violates the policy of developing production and resists the anti-bribery movement. I am now reporting this situation to you, hoping to attract the attention of relevant departments and other places.

### 天津市有些不法商人  以“新经营方式”逃避资金  模糊工人店员阶级意识

    天津市有些不法商人
    以“新经营方式”逃避资金
    模糊工人店员阶级意识
    编辑同志：我在天津参加反贪污、反行贿检查组的工作时，有些工人向我反映：在新年和春节前后，有不少商号实行了所谓“新经营方式”。这种“新经营方式”的基本办法是：资本家把大部资金抽走，留下极少量的资金从事经营。如果经营得好，劳资双方均分利润（甚至包括一部分资金）；如果经营得不好，让商店垮台了事。如天津二区起发顺饭馆资方，自今年一月一日起，把大部资金抽走，留下三十袋面（还没有过去两天的营业额多）作资金，实行“新经营方式”。资方管账，劳方掌握现金。资方每天从当天的营业额中提取六万元作“家庭生活补助费”；劳方（十个工人）提取七万七千元作工资。每天剩余的款项积累下来，在春节、端午节、中秋节，提出百分之二十的“公积金”，其余劳资双方均分。如果营业不好，需要补充资金，劳资双方谁有办法谁去借，借不到则垮台了事。天津南市华顺成果子铺在春节以后，也实行了和起发顺饭馆类似的“新经营方式”。资方抽走了大部资金，剩下三袋面、五十斤油作经营资金（约等于过去一天的营业额）。资金统由劳方掌管，资方只作些“跑街”、“开会”的杂活。但资方每日除从营业额中抽取一万元作“家庭生活补助费”以外，每月还要抽取价值一袋半面粉的“月钱”。将来营业好，由劳资双方均分红利；营业不好，资方不负任何责任，让铺子垮台了事。
    在天津，实行所谓“新经营方式”的商店现在不是个别的。据初步调查，天津市货栈、豆食、果子、饭馆四个行业中，实行这种办法的，就有一百多户。我曾问过几个资本家，为什么要实行这种“新经营方式”。他们说：“你们以前说我登黑账，偷税漏税，现在实行新经营方式，营业公开，工人掌管，发展生产，劳资两利。这都是按照政府的意思办的。”他们把逃避资金的行为，说得非常冠冕堂皇！
    我觉得这个情况很严重，这是资产阶级违反发展生产的政策，抵抗反行贿运动的非法行为。现在把这个情况反映给你们，希望引起有关部门及其他各地的注意。
