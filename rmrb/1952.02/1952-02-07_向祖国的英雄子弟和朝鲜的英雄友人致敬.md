    Saluting the Heroic Sons and Daughters of the Motherland and the Heroic Friends of Korea
    “Second-Class Combat Hero” Wang Qinglin
    Wang Qinglin, the deputy political instructor of the Second Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, is a brave and skilled, calm and steadfast political mobilizer and commander. On the Korean battlefield, he participated in the first, fourth, and fifth campaigns, earned a Second-Class Merit, and was awarded the glorious title of "Second-Class Combat Hero in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea."
    During the nine days and nights of the Battle of Garye Mountain, our army was ordered to transfer in order to annihilate more of the enemy's effective strength, and the Second Company was tasked with covering the withdrawal. At dawn on April 15, 1951, the enemy gathered two battalions of troops and launched a fierce attack on our position from two directions. As usual, the enemy first carried out indiscriminate bombardment of our position with dense artillery fire and a large number of aircraft, and then released smoke bombs. At this time, the smoke filled the entire mountain, and people could not be seen beyond ten meters. Taking advantage of this opportunity, part of the enemy force detoured behind our right-wing position, cutting off contact between the first and third platoons and the company command post. Wang Qinglin quickly ordered the Second Platoon to support them. At this time, King Peak (the highest peak of Garye Mountain, 1,100 meters above sea level) was also occupied by another enemy force, and the situation was extremely urgent. Wang Qinglin thought, "If we transfer our position at this time, not only will we not be able to complete the task, but it will also cause huge casualties to the entire company." He discussed it with Company Commander Hao Qingtang and decided, "We must persevere." They redeployed: Hao Qingtang led the Second Platoon soldiers to continue to hold the position; Wang Qinglin led a temporary squad composed of medics, barbers, communication soldiers, buglers, and machine gun and ammunition handlers to support the first and third platoons.
    A fierce battle began again. Our machine guns swept fiercely at the enemy, and bugler Wang Yanhe and medic Zhou Fushun raised grenades and threw them at the enemy. At this time, the first and third platoons also charged up from the foot of the mountain, and under the combined attack of both sides, the enemy's frenzied attack was completely crushed. Under the command of Company Commander Hao Qingtang, the Second Platoon also successfully completed its task. The enemy's boasted "artillery power" only resulted in more than two hundred corpses and the loss of five tanks.
    Comrade Wang Yinhu talks about the Battle of Hill 572.4
    I am the political instructor of a certain battalion of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Last November, we were ordered to occupy Hill 572.4 east of Jin City. We decided that the First Company would attack the first hilltop of Hill 572.4 from the cross in the east, and the Second Company would attack the fourth hilltop from Sangdong. Before entering the position, we made a large amount of dry food. We entered the position on the 23rd, when the snow was nearly a foot deep. We lay in shelters built of snow, waiting for orders from our superiors.
    On the evening of the 25th, the battle began. When the First Company reached the first hilltop of Hill 572.4, they discovered that the enemy's forward positions were fortified with deer fences. The demolition squad leader, Deng Xianglin, led two soldiers with hand grenades to quickly approach the enemy along the snow-covered path. When they approached the deer fence, they suddenly stepped on a flare, exposing their target. The enemy's machine-gun fire immediately swept over them. Comrade Deng Xianglin skillfully used the terrain to quickly lie down, and using the light of the flare, he observed the enemy's defenses. At this time, one of the two soldiers he led was killed and the other was wounded, further arousing his hatred for the enemy. Without hesitation, he took a grenade from the body of the fallen comrade and quickly climbed towards the deer fence. With a "boom," a gap was blown in the deer fence. At the same time, the assault team had also arrived, ready to charge. However, the enemy's machine gun was firing fiercely at the gap in the deer fence. Comrade Deng Xianglin quickly climbed over the gap in the deer fence and crawled towards the enemy's machine-gun emplacement. As he approached the position, the enemy threw two grenades at him. He immediately and alertly lay down, and with the rising smoke, he rolled to the flank, pulled out a grenade, "Boom!" The machine-gun emplacement was destroyed. The first major hilltop was occupied by us. We took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy and occupied all four hilltops along the eight-li stretch.
    In the following four days and four nights, the enemy and we fought fiercely between the four hilltops of Hill 572.4, engaging in intense battles. On the 26th and 27th, the enemy attacked us with two battalions of troops, but were repelled. On the 29th, the enemy launched another frantic attack on us with a regiment of troops, which was also met with a heavy blow from us. In five days and five nights, we annihilated a total of more than 1,500 enemies.
    Excellent Political Worker Wu Jianguo
    Comrade Wu Jianguo is the political instructor of the Second Company of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. During the Blockade Battle of Fenghuo Mountain, he convened the Second Company's Party branch committee on the position, enabling all the company's cadres to have a clear and unified understanding of the combat mission. The branch committee members raised their hands and swore: "Communist Party members can only move forward, not retreat," and proposed the heroic slogan that the entire company should strive to become a "fighting steel company."
    Comrade Wu Jianguo paid close attention to the ideological and political leadership of the troops. He often rolled around in the artillery fire with the soldiers. He was familiar with the soldiers' ideological changes and combat situations and was able to put forward new motivational slogans in a timely manner. When the Battle of Fenghuo Mountain was in full swing, the Second Platoon was designated as the assault platoon. Wu Jianguo braved the artillery fire to go to the Second Platoon's position to mobilize them, calling on the Second Platoon to win collective merit. After the Third Platoon repelled the enemy's attack, he personally climbed to the forefront of the Third Platoon's position to encourage and comfort them. The soldiers of the Third Platoon said with emotion: "Instructor, don't worry, we will resolutely repel the enemy and hold the position." Wu Jianguo was even better at organizing Party members and members of the Communist Youth League to carry out political mobilization in a timely manner, so that the troops always maintained a strong fighting spirit.
    In addition to paying attention to political work, Wu Jianguo was also able to assist the company commander in commanding the troops in combat in emergency situations. During the Battle of Fenghuo Mountain, the company command post was surrounded by the enemy on three sides. He calmly organized all the support personnel to join the battle. At this time, he was already wounded, but he personally fired four explosive packs, fourteen anti-tank mines, one hundred and ten grenades, and more than one hundred and fifty rounds of submachine gun bullets, annihilating one hundred and thirty enemies and repelling the enemy's attack. The next day, when organizing the Second Platoon to counterattack, Wu Jianguo personally led the squad and platoon leaders to look at the terrain and choose the attack route and breakthrough point. When the charge was launched, he personally organized fire support, enabling the Second Platoon to successfully complete the counterattack mission.
    Battlefield Propaganda Mobilization Worker Wang You'en
    Wang You'en is the political instructor of the Ninth Company of a certain unit of the People's Volunteer Army. In the Fifth Campaign, the Ninth Company greatly leveraged the power of political work, enabling the troops to maintain a consistently high fighting spirit.
    When the Fifth Campaign kicked off, the troops began to advance towards Dashuidong. The Ninth Company was at the forefront of the advancing ranks. Wang You'en inspired the soldiers to recognize the profound significance of the grain and canned goods sent by the people of the motherland from thousands of miles away, calling on everyone to "continue to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition and resolutely eliminate the enemy." The soldiers were all radiant and full of fighting spirit. The Cui Jianguo Platoon took only five minutes to destroy four enemy bunkers and ten minutes to capture three hilltops, clearing obstacles along the way. At this time, the battalion command post immediately wrote a letter to commend the Cui Jianguo Platoon, and Wang You'en called them "people of honor," calling on all platoons to learn from them, further enhancing the fighting spirit of the entire company. Dashuidong appeared in front of the Ninth Company, and Wang You'en immediately issued a loud call: "Comrades, the time has come to perform meritorious service for the motherland!" The Second Platoon successively attacked three hillocks and inserted itself into the enemy's artillery position. A fierce assault battle unfolded around Dashuidong. The company commander was killed in battle. Wang You'en shouted: "Perform meritorious service for the motherland, avenge the company commander, seize the enemy's weapons and strike the enemy!" The soldiers rushed into the enemy ranks, and in the pitch-black night, a bayonet fight broke out. The machine gunner Wei Ming ran out of bullets, and an enemy rushed up, but he was beaten to death with a stone. Two more enemies charged with bayonets, but he wielded his iron shovel, splitting the heads of the two enemies. Ammunition handler Wang Yincheng was knocked to the ground by an enemy, and he bit off one of the enemy's ears. Deputy Squad Leader Shen Xueli was wounded in four places, but he still fought bravely with the enemy. At this time, our main force troops rushed up from all directions, launching an annihilation battle. The next day, Dashuidong was littered with enemy cars, weapons, and corpses. The Ninth Company won a major merit, and the Second Platoon was praised as the "Cui Jianguo Platoon of Chinese Sons and Daughters."
    Korean Model Farmer Mun Ui-bok
    In October 1950, Mun Ui-bok followed the local staff from her hometown (Jikdong-ri, Gomen, Sinxi County, Hwanghae Province) to the Suyan area to join the People's Guerrilla. When she returned to her hometown to raise food for the guerrillas, she was suddenly arrested by the reactionary organization - "Local Security Team". The "Security Team" sent her to the county, tortured her severely, and forced her to tell the whereabouts of the People's Army. Mun Ui-bok is a model worker in agricultural production in Korea. She has listened to General Kim Il-sung's speech at several meetings. She has never forgotten the teachings of the leader. She often thought that she should be loyal to the Party, loyal to the country and the people. Therefore, although she was beaten unconscious several times, she never revealed any information about the People's Army. The "Security Team" did not force anything out of her, so they decided to shoot her the next day. However, the reactionaries' plan did not come true - before dawn the next day, Sinxi County was liberated by the guerrillas.
    Following the guerrillas to Ichuan County, Gangwon Province, Mun Ui-bok served as the leader of the guerrillas' detachment. At that time, the main task of the guerrillas was to destroy the enemy's rear transportation lines. On one occasion, they destroyed eighteen enemy vehicles. Mun Ui-bok's steadfastness and spirit of heroic struggle were praised by the superiors.
    With the victorious counterattack of the Chinese and Korean people's forces, their guerrillas and the People's Army soon went to the front. Mun Ui-bok was ordered to leave the team and return to her liberated hometown to work. When she returned to her hometown, she saw that her house had been burned down by the enemy, her husband had been killed by the enemy, and her mother was missing. The fire of revenge burned her heart and deepened her hatred for the enemy. She produced more actively. She actively mobilized the women in her hometown to transport grain and ammunition to the People's Army, and paid public grain, powerfully supporting the front line.
    Korean Model Farmer Kim Seung-man
    Korean model farmer Kim Seung-man was a poor peasant before the "August 15th" liberation of Korea. After liberation, he was allocated land, worked actively in the village (ri), and actively paid public grain. Therefore, he was elected chairman of the Farmers' Association by the villagers.
    After the war began, because three people in his family joined the People's Army, the labor force was reduced, and production was difficult. But Kim Seung-man did not bow his head in the face of difficulties. He knew that producing one more grain would increase the strength to strike the enemy. Therefore, he more actively mobilized the men and women, old and young in the village to work hard to produce, pay more public grain, and mobilized the villagers to donate four cattle and many items to comfort the People's Army. Because enemy planes harassed during the day, Kim Seung-man often worked in the fields at night. He turned over all the grain he produced, except for what was left for food, to the public grain. Kim Seung-man's patriotic actions inspired the enthusiasm of the villagers to support the Fatherland Liberation War.
    Kim Seung-man said that after he came to China, he saw the vigorous movement of resisting US aggression and aiding Korea and the movement of increasing production and practicing economy launched by the Chinese people, which further improved his confidence in victory. He said that after returning home, he must convey the experience learned in China to the Korean farmers, and encourage the Korean farmers to work harder to increase production and support the Fatherland Liberation War.

    向祖国的英雄子弟和朝鲜的英雄友人致敬
    “二级战斗英雄”王庆琳
    志愿军某部二连副政治指导员王庆琳，是一个英勇善战、沉着坚强的政治鼓动者和指挥员。在朝鲜战场上，他曾经参加第一、四、五次战役，立过二等功，并获得“抗美援朝二级战斗英雄”的光荣称号。
    在加里山战斗进行了九昼夜的时候，为了便于更多地歼灭敌人的有生力量，我军奉令转移，二连担任掩护。一九五一年四月十五日的拂晓，敌人又集结了两营的兵力，分两路向我阵地猛攻。敌军照例又先以密集的炮火和大量的机群，向我阵地施行盲目的轰击，随后又放射烟幕弹，这时烟雾弥漫着整个山头，十公尺以外便看不到人。敌人一部兵力趁此机会，迂回到我右翼阵地背后，切断了一、三排与连指挥所的联系。王庆琳迅速命令二排去支援。这时，国王峰（加里山最高峰，海拔一千一百公尺）也被另外一股敌人占领，情况异常紧急。王庆琳想：“如果这时转移阵地，不但我们不能完成任务，而且也会造成全连的巨大伤亡。”他就和连长郝庆堂商量一下，并且决定：“一定要坚持下去。”他们重新部署：郝庆堂率领二排战士继续坚守阵地；王庆琳带着卫生员、理发员、通讯员、司号员和机枪、弹药手等组成的临时班，去支援一、三排。
    一场激烈的战斗又开始了。我们的机枪对准敌人猛扫，司号员王彦和、卫生员周福顺举起手榴弹向敌人扔去。这时，一、三排也从山下杀上来，在我双方夹攻下，敌人的疯狂进攻被彻底粉碎了。二排在连长郝庆堂指挥下，也胜利地完成了任务。敌人所夸耀的“炮火威力”，换得的只是二百多具死尸和五辆坦克的损失。
    王银虎同志谈五七二·四高地的战斗
    我是志愿军某营的教导员。去年十一月，我们奉命占领金城以东的五七二·四高地。我们决定第一连从东面十字架上打五七二·四高地的第一个山头，第二连从桑洞打第四个山头。进入阵地前，我们做了大批干粮。二十三日进入阵地，这时雪已近一尺深。我们躺在以雪筑成的掩蔽部里，等待着上级的命令。
    二十五日晚上，战斗开始了。当第一连摸上五七二·四高地的第一个山头时，发现敌人的前沿布有鹿砦，便由爆破班长邓祥林率领二个战士持手雷迅速沿满铺冰雪的小路摸向敌人。当他们接近鹿砦时，忽然踏响一个照明雷，暴露了目标，敌人机枪火力随即猛烈扫来。邓祥林同志灵活地利用地形迅速卧倒，乘着照明雷的光亮，观察敌人的布防。这时，他带领的两个战士一个牺牲，一个负伤，更激起了他对敌人的憎恨。他毫不犹豫地从牺牲的同志身上取下手雷，迅速爬向鹿砦。“轰”的一声，鹿砦炸了一个缺口，在这同时，突击队也已赶到，准备冲锋，但敌人的机枪正对中鹿砦的缺口猛烈射击。邓祥林同志又迅速爬过鹿砦缺口，爬向敌人的机枪工事，将接近阵地时，敌人对中他扔了两颗手榴弹，他当即机警地卧倒，随着炸起的浓烟，向侧翼一滚，掏出手雷，“轰”！机枪阵地一下就被消灭了。第一个主要山头即被我们占领。我们乘胜追击敌人，把八里长的四个山头全部占领。
    在以后的四天四夜内，敌我在五七二·四高地的四个山头之间反复争夺，进行了激烈的战斗。二十六、七两日，敌以两个营的兵力向我进攻，都被打退。二十九日，敌人又以一个团的兵力向我们疯狂进攻，同样也遭到我们的沉重打击。五天五夜内，我们一共歼灭敌人一千五百余人。
    优秀的政治工作者武建国
    武建国同志是中国人民志愿军某部二连的政治指导员，在烽火山阻击战中，他在阵地上召开了二连党的支委会，使全连干部对战斗任务有明确的一致的认识。支委们举手宣誓：“共产党员只有向前不能退后”，并提出全连要争取成为“战斗的钢铁连”的英雄口号。
    武建国同志很注意部队的思想领导和政治领导，他经常和战士在炮火里滚来滚去，他熟悉战士们的思想变化和战斗情况，能够及时提出新的鼓动口号。烽火山战斗正激烈时，二排为突击排，武建国冒着炮火到二排阵地去进行动员，号召二排立集体功；当三排击退敌人的进攻后，他又亲自爬到三排阵地的最前沿进行鼓励和慰问，三排的战士感动地说：“指导员你放心吧，我们坚决把敌人打退，守住阵地。”武建国更善于组织党员、团员及时进行政治鼓动，使部队始终保持了旺盛的战斗情绪。
    武建国除注意政治工作外，在紧急的情况下，他还能协助连长指挥部队作战。烽火山战斗中，连指挥所被敌人三面包围了，他沉着地把所有的勤杂人员都组织了起来投入战斗。此时他已负伤，但他一个人还打出爆破筒四个，反坦克雷十四个，手榴弹一百一十个，冲锋枪弹一百五十余发，歼敌一百三十名，打退了敌人的进攻。第二天组织二排反击时，武建国又亲自带领班、排长去看地形，选择进攻的道路和突击点。当发起冲锋后，他又亲自组织火力支援，使二排顺利地完成了反击任务。
    战地宣传鼓动工作者王有恩
    王有恩是人民志愿军某部九连的政治指导员。九连在五次战役中，大大发挥了政治工作的威力，使部队始终保持了高涨的战斗情绪。
    五次战役打响了，部队开始向大水洞进击，九连走在进军行列的最前头。王有恩启发战士们认识祖国人民从数千里以外送来的一粒米，一个罐头的深厚意义，号召大家“继续发扬光荣的革命传统，坚决消灭敌人”。战士们个个精神焕发，斗志昂扬。崔建国排用五分钟的时间，打掉了敌人的四个地堡，用十分钟的时间攻占了三个山头，扫清了进军途中的障碍。这时，营指挥所立即写信给崔建国排立功，王有恩称他们为“荣誉的人”，号召各排一齐向他们学习，更加提高了全连的战斗情绪。大水洞出现在九连的面前，王有恩立刻发出响亮的号召：“同志们，为祖国立功的时候到了！”二排接连打了三个山包，插进了敌人的炮兵阵地，大水洞的周围展开了激烈的冲杀战。连长在战斗中牺牲了。王有恩高呼：“为祖国立功，为连长报仇，夺取敌人的武器打击敌人！”战士们纷纷冲入敌群，在漆黑的夜里，展开了白刃战。机枪手魏明的子弹打光了，有一个敌人冲上来，被他用石头打死；又有两个敌人端着刺刀刺来，他飞舞着铁锹，劈碎了两个敌人的脑袋。弹药手王银成被一个敌人压倒在地上，他咬掉了敌人的一个耳朵。副班长申学礼负伤四处，还勇猛地和敌人拚杀。这时，我军主力部队从四面八方冲上来，展开了歼灭战。第二天，大水洞遍地是敌人的汽车、武器和尸体。第九连立大功一次，二排被誉为“中华儿女崔建国排”。
    朝鲜模范农民文义福
    一九五○年十月，文义福从她的家乡（黄海道新溪郡古面直洞里）随着地方工作人员撤到水安地区，参加了人民游击队。当她又回到家乡去为游击队筹措粮食时，突然被反动派的组织——“地方治安队”逮捕了。“治安队”把她送到郡里，严刑拷打，逼她说出人民军的所在地。文义福是朝鲜农业生产中的劳动模范，她曾在好几次会议上聆听过金日成将军的讲话，她时时刻刻都没有忘记过领袖的教诲。她常常想，应该忠于党，忠于祖国和人民。因此，虽然她几次被打得昏了过去，但是她始终没有吐露一点儿关于人民军的消息。“治安队”什么话也没有逼出来，就决定第二天要枪毙她。然而，反动派的计划却没有实现——第二天天还没有亮，新溪郡就被游击队解放了。
    文义福随着游击队转移到江原道伊川郡后，担任了游击队的分队长。当时游击队的主要任务是破坏敌人后方的交通线。有一次，他们炸毁了十八辆敌人的汽车。文义福的坚贞不屈和英勇斗争的精神，受到了上级的表扬。
    随着中朝人民部队反击的胜利，他们的游击队和人民军一起不久就开往前方，文义福奉命离开队伍，又回到解放了的家乡去工作。当她回到家乡后，看到她的房子被敌人烧光了，丈夫被敌人杀死了，母亲也不知下落了。复仇的怒火灼痛了她的心，更加加深了她对敌人的仇恨。她更加积极地生产，她积极动员家乡的妇女们为人民军运粮食，运弹药，缴纳公粮，有力地支援了前线。
    朝鲜模范农民金承万
    朝鲜模范农民金承万在“八一五”朝鲜解放前是一个贫农，解放后分到了土地，在村（里）里工作积极，缴纳公粮踊跃。因此，被村里的人选为农民会主席。
    战争开始后，他家中因为有三个人参加人民军，劳动力减少，生产发生了困难。但金承万并没有在困难面前低头，他知道多生产一粒粮，就多增加一分打击敌人的力量；于是，他更加积极地动员村里的男女老少，努力生产，多交公粮，并动员村民捐献了四头牛和许多慰劳人民军的物品。因为白天敌机袭扰，金承万常常晚上去地里做活。他把生产的粮食，除掉留作食用的以外，都缴了公粮。金承万的爱国行动，鼓舞了全村农民支援祖国解放战争的热情。
    金承万说，他来到中国后，看到了中国人民轰轰烈烈展开的抗美援朝运动和增产节约运动，更提高了胜利的信心。他表示回国后，一定要把在中国学习到的经验传达给朝鲜农民，鼓励朝鲜农民更加努力增加生产，支援祖国解放战争。（附图片）
