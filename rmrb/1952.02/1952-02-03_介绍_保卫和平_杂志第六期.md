Introducing "Defend Peace" Magazine, Issue 6

	As the United Nations held its sixth General Assembly in Paris, and Vyshinsky delivered a series of important speeches at the meeting, "Defend Peace" magazine's sixth issue published several important articles discussing the United Nations. President Pierre Cot's editorial, "The United Nations Must Be Defended," analyzed the current state of the United Nations and the principles it should follow. He pointed out that all peace advocates should not be disappointed in the United Nations, and should take responsibility for defending the United Nations—"opposing those who shamelessly stole the power of the United Nations and used this wonderful instrument of peace to serve an imperialism." Claude Morgan's article, "The Disagreements of the Five Great Powers," fully narrated the process of the United Nations from its birth to its straying from the path. Sir John Pratt, former advisor to the Far Eastern Department of the British Foreign Office, also explained in his discussion of "The Real Situation in China" that when China obtains its proper great power status in the United Nations, it will have a huge impact on the world. Yves Farge, Chairman of the French Peace Committee, in his article "France and the Peace Pact," explained that only by concluding a Five-Power Peace Pact and stopping the arms race can France be saved from the disaster it faces.

	Another focus of this issue is the continued discussion of improving economic relations between the East and West. Around this theme, there is Charles Bettelheim's paper "East-West Trade at the Present Stage," Michel Debonni's survey report on the French port of Marseille, and an interview with a British businessman, parliamentary candidate, and British journalist discussing "The Crisis in Britain."

	This issue contains three articles on the Egyptian question, the current situation in Spain, and the situation in West Germany. There is also "Chile, My Country" written by Pablo Neruda and "The People's Health and Hygiene in the People's Republic of China" written by He Cheng.

	The poet Paul Éluard and the painter Picasso collaborated on "The True Face of Peace" for this issue; Madame Joliot-Curie wrote "Madame Gordon's Seventieth Birthday"; and Sergei Obraztsov, director of the Soviet State Puppet Theater, wrote an article introducing how the Soviet Union uses puppet shows to educate children.

    介绍“保卫和平”杂志第六期
    当联合国在巴黎举行第六届大会，维辛斯基在会上连续发表重要演说的时候，“保卫和平”杂志第六期发表了几篇讨论联合国的重要文章。皮尔·戈特社长的社论“必须保卫联合国”，分析了联合国的现状以及它应该遵循的原则。他指出，所有和平拥护者不应该对联合国失望，要负起保卫联合国的责任——“反对那些无耻地盗窃了联合国权力、把这美好的和平工具用去为一个帝国主义服务的人们。”克罗德·摩尔岗的“五大国的分歧”一文，源源本本地叙述了联合国从诞生到走入歧途的经过。曾任英国外交部远东司顾问的约翰·布拉特爵士在谈“中国的实况”时，也说明当中国在联合国中取得它应有的大国地位时，将对全世界起着巨大的作用。法国和平委员会主席伊维斯·法奇的“法国与和平公约”一文，说明缔结五大国和平公约，停止备战政策，才能挽救法国面临的灾难。
    本期的另一个中心，是继续讨论改进东西世界的经济关系问题。围绕这一主题，有查理·裴德伦的论文“现阶段的东西贸易”，有米歇尔·德波尼的法国港口马赛调查报告，还有一篇英国商业家、议院候选人和英国新闻记者谈“英国的危机”的访问记。
    本期载有有关埃及问题、西班牙现状和西德情况的三篇文章。还有巴勃罗·聂鲁达所写的“智利，我的国家”和贺诚写的“中华人民共和国人民的保健和卫生状况”。
    诗人艾吕霞和画家毕迦索，为本期合作了“和平的真正面容”；约里奥—居里夫人写了“戈登夫人七十寿辰”；苏联国家木偶戏院院长塞尔治·奥布拉特索夫写了一篇介绍苏联怎样利用木偶戏来教育儿童的文章。
