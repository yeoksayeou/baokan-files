    The leading body of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement—the Thrift Examination Committee—must be pure and powerful; otherwise, the movement will inevitably fail.
    The leading cadres of the Culture and Education Bureau's Literary and Art Department of the Beijing Municipal People's Government rashly entrusted the anti-corruption movement of the Literary and Art Department's Secretariat Section to Zhang Yishan, the head of the Secretariat Section, to lead; and absorbed Zhang Yishan into the Thrift Examination Committee as deputy director. Who is Zhang Yishan? He is a corrupt element. Why didn't the leading cadres of the Literary and Art Department know this? At the beginning of the anti-corruption movement, some staff members of the Literary and Art Department pointed out that there were major problems with the Secretariat Section led by Zhang Yishan, and demanded that he be the focus of the anti-corruption effort. However, the leading cadres of the Literary and Art Department ignored the opinions of the masses and actually let a thief catch thieves. This is precisely treating the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement with a bureaucratic attitude. Zhang Yishan used his authority to make a show of force and messed things up, then hastily declared that the "movement has basically ended." After taking a big detour, the anti-corruption movement in the Literary and Art Department only began to intensify after Zhang Yishan was removed from his post.
    To make the leadership of the Thrift Examination Committee sound and effective, the superior leading organs must strictly examine the members participating in the Thrift Examination Committee. The qualifications of these members should be firm in their stance, have clean hands, and possess an upright style. All departments should earnestly examine the members of the Thrift Examination Committee, assess whether they can shoulder the heavy responsibility of leading this movement; resolutely remove those who are incompetent, especially corrupt elements or those colluding with corrupt elements, and improve the Thrift Examination Committee. Only in this way is it possible to victoriously complete the battle task of repelling the bourgeois offensive.

    清除贪污分子，健全节约检查委员会
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的领导机构——节约检查委员会，必须是纯洁的、有力的；否则，运动必然搞不好。
    北京市人民政府文教局文艺处的领导干部，轻率地把文艺处秘书科的反贪污运动，交给秘书科科长张一山去领导；并把张一山吸收到节约检查委员会担任副主任的职务。张一山是什么人呢？是一个贪污分子。文艺处的领导干部为什么不知道呢？反贪污运动刚开始时文艺处的一些工作人员就提出张一山领导的秘书科大有问题，要求以他作为反贪污的重点。但文艺处的领导干部却不管群众的意见，竟让贼去捉贼，这正是以官僚主义的态度对待反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。张一山利用职权，虚张声势地乱搞一通，就匆匆忙忙地宣告“运动基本结束”。走了一大段弯路，直到撤换张一山的职务之后，文艺处的反贪污运动才猛烈开展起来。
    要使节约检查委员会的领导健全有力，就必须由上级领导机关严格审查参加节约检查委员会的成员。这些成员的条件，应该是立场坚定，手上干净，作风正派。各部门应切实检查一下节约检查委员会的成员，考查他们能否担当领导这一运动的重任；要把不能胜任的，特别是贪污分子或和贪污分子有勾结的人坚决清洗出去，把节约检查委员会健全起来。只有这样，才有可能胜利地完成反击资产阶级进攻的战斗任务。
