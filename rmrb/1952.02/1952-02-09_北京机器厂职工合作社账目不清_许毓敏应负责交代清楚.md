    Beijing Machine Factory Workers' Cooperative's Unclear Accounts
    Xu Yumin Should Be Responsible for Explaining Clearly
    To the Editor: The accounts of Xu Yumin, the former person in charge of our factory's workers' cooperative, have not been clearly explained. During his tenure, the workers made suggestions to him, asking him to publish the profit and loss figures monthly, but he always ignored them. After the merger of Branch Factory No. 1 and the main factory, the workers of Branch Factory No. 1 transferred the funds and dividends of the branch factory's cooperative together, asking him to be responsible for the operation. He neither convened a representative meeting nor explained it to the workers. No one knew how he handled it. Later, he secretly left his job and became the accounting director of the Third District Cooperative. Now, our factory's workers' cooperative has issued a notice asking workers to increase their shareholdings. However, the workers have expressed that they will wait until Xu Yumin clarifies the accounts. Everyone is very dissatisfied with Xu Yumin's messy accounts. This matter has been delayed until now and has not been resolved. I hope that relevant departments will assist our factory in handling it quickly.

    北京机器厂职工合作社账目不清
    许毓敏应负责交代清楚
    编辑同志：我厂职工合作社前任负责人许毓敏的账目，没有交代清楚。在他任职期间，职工们向他提意见，要他每月公布盈亏数字，但他始终不理。一分厂和总厂合并后，一分厂职工把分厂合作社的资金和红利一起转过来，要他负责经营；他既不召开代表会，也不向职工交代，谁也不知他是怎么处理的。以后，他便偷偷地脱离本职，担任第三区合作社的会计主任。现在，我厂职工合作社又发出通知，要职工增缴股金。但职工纷纷表示：要等许毓敏把账弄清了再说。大家对许毓敏的乱七八糟的账目表示非常不满。这事拖到现在还没得到解决。我希望有关部门协助我厂迅速予以处理。
