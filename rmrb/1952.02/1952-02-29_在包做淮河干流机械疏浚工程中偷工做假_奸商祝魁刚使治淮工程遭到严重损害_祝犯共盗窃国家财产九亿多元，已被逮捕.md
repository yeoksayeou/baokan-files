    In the Huai River Mainstream Mechanical Dredging Project in Baoyi, Shoddy Work and Cutting Corners
    by a Treacherous Merchant Zhu Kuigang Seriously Damaged the Huai River Project
    Zhu Committed the Crime of Stealing Over 900 Million Yuan in State Property and Has Been Arrested
    Zhu Kuigang, the owner of the Shanghai Kuiji Construction Company, systematically cut corners and faked work in the mechanical dredging project of the Huai River mainstream in Baoyi, overestimating earthwork volume and stealing over 900 million yuan (according to preliminary calculations) in state wealth, causing significant damage to the Huai River project.
    In June 1950, Zhu Kuigang contracted the 300,000 cubic meter mechanical dredging project in the Zheng (Zhengyangguan) to Liu (Liuzikou) section of the Huai River mainstream. In order to make huge profits from the contracted project, before and after signing the contract, he actively colluded with Zhang Jinnong, who was sent by the Huai River General Bureau to be responsible for preparing and contracting the mechanical dredging project and served as the captain of the mechanical dredging team (Zhang Jinnong was an old friend of Zhu Kuigang, who joined the Huai River General Bureau after liberation. Before that, he was also a construction company owner and had cooperated with Zhu Kuigang on contracting projects). He learned about the Huai River General Bureau's unit price budget for contracting the mechanical dredging project in order to raise the unit price of earthwork and overdraw the start-up funds. After the project started, Zhu Kuigang, on the one hand, used Zhang Jinnong's authority to speculate; on the other hand, he directly used his confidants Zhou Binsen and Qian Wenjun, and henchmen Zhang Jinxiang and Wang Zhangjun, etc., to bribe and corrupt the cadres of the mechanical dredging team and the technicians on the engine boats by various despicable and shameless means, in an attempt to prevent those who supervised the project from playing their supervisory role and to make the technicians of the engine boats completely obey their command, so as to cheat arbitrarily. With the help of Zhang Jinnong, and in the case of many cadres neglecting their duties due to bribery, Zhu Kuigang arbitrarily cheated and damaged the Huai River project. In order to dig more soil, they disregarded the standards, exceeded the designated digging line, and dug the soil that was easy to dig, which was actually equivalent to not digging; when encountering relatively difficult sandy soil, they abandoned entire sections (some sections were abandoned for hundreds of meters), or did not dig to the specified depth, or left strips of earth embankments. In order to dig more soil, Zhu Kuigang even instigated the soil unloading laborers not to carry the soil to the designated location, and even unloaded the soil into the water near the wooden boats, causing the dug-up soil to flow back into the river channel or pile up into new sandbars. In order to load half a boat of soil and report a full boat, he got the surveyor drunk with alcohol or took him to bathe, so that the surveyor would leave the construction site early. Zhu Kuigang adopted the above methods of cutting corners and faking work, stealing a total of over 735.6 million yuan in state property converted to RMB. After Zhu Kuigang obtained a large amount of ill-gotten gains, he used bribery to evade taxes payable to the state, amounting to approximately 160 million yuan in RMB. Due to Zhu Kuigang's shoddy work and fraud, the Huai River project suffered incalculable damage: First, due to insufficient digging depth and leaving earth embankments, as well as dumping soil in the water to wash back into the river channel, the water capacity and flow rate were greatly reduced. If no remedial measures are taken, the water level will inevitably rise when floods arrive; when the water level exceeds the required level, there will be a risk of overflow. Second, the slowing of the water flow may create new shoals. Third, it directly affected the navigation of ships. Grounding of ships often occurred in the Zhengliu section. In 1951, when urgently transporting materials to the Runheji construction site, ships were grounded, blocking more than 50 large ships from passing. The "Jiangyong" steamship ran aground on hard soil, suspending navigation and damaging the rudder. Fourth, the Huai River project could not be completed as planned. Fifth, it created a negative political impact, such as people on civilian ships angrily scolding when they ran aground here. Sixth, it caused huge losses to the national economy. Not only was a huge amount of wealth directly stolen by Zhu Kuigang, but the state also had to pay a large amount of funds to redo the project.
    The Shanghai Municipal People's Government arrested the two criminals, Zhu Kuigang and Zhou Binsen, on February 16 and escorted them to Bengbu for disposal. The Engineering Department of the Huai River Commission also took Zhang Jinnong back to the agency on February 20 for criticism. (Liu Xing)

    在包做淮河干流机械疏浚工程中偷工做假
    奸商祝魁刚使治淮工程遭到严重损害
    祝犯共盗窃国家财产九亿多元，已被逮捕
    上海魁记营造厂老板祝魁刚，在包做淮河干流的机械疏浚工程中，有计划地偷工作假，多算土方，盗窃国家财富九亿多元（据初步计算），使治淮工程遭到重大的损害。
    祝魁刚在一九五○年六月间，承包了淮河干流正（正阳关）溜（溜子口）段内三十万公方的机械疏浚工程。为了能够在承包工程中牟取暴利，在订立包工合同前后，就积极和当时淮河总局派出负责筹备和出包机械疏浚工程、并担任机械疏浚队长的张谨农进行勾结（张谨农是祝魁刚的老朋友，在解放后参加淮河总局工作，在这以前也是个营造厂老板，曾和祝魁刚合作包过工程），了解淮河总局关于出包机械疏浚工程的单价预算，以抬高土方单价，并超额预支开工经费。工程开始后，祝魁刚一方面利用张谨农的职权，投机取巧；一方面直接利用其心腹周滨森、钱文俊，爪牙张锦湘、王章俊等，以种种卑鄙、无耻的手段，普遍地贿赂、腐蚀机械疏浚队的干部和机船上的技工，企图使监督工程的人不起监督工程的作用，使机船的技工完全听从他们的支配，以肆意作弊。祝魁刚在张谨农的帮助下，在很多干部因受贿失责的情况下，任意作弊，破坏治淮工程。他们为了多挖土，不顾标准，超越指定挖土线，拣好挖的土挖，实际上等于不挖；碰到比较难挖的沙土，则整段整段地丢掉不挖（有的段丢掉数百公尺），或不挖到规定深度，或丢下一条条的土埂。为了多挖土，祝魁刚更唆使卸土民工不把土挑到指定地点，甚至把土卸在木船附近的水里，致使挖上来的土又冲入河槽，或又堆成新的沙滩。为了能装半船土报满船土，他把收方员用酒灌醉，或拉去洗澡，使收方员早离工地。祝魁刚采取以上种种偷工、作假的办法，共盗窃国家财产、折合人民币七亿三千五百多万元。祝魁刚获得大量的暴利后，又用行贿的办法，偷漏了应向国家缴纳的税款约合人民币一亿六千多万元。由于祝魁刚的偷工作假，治淮工程遭到难以计算的损害：第一、由于挖的深度不够和丢下土埂，以及把土倒在水里冲回河槽等原因，大大地减少了水的容量及水的流量、流速。如不进行补救，在洪水到来时，必然抬高水位；在超过应有的水位时，就会发生漫决的危险。第二、由于水的流速减慢，可能造成新的浅滩。第三、直接影响了船只的航行。在正溜段内经常发生船只搁浅现象。一九五一年向润河集工地紧急运输材料时，船只搁浅，阻拦了五十多只大船不能过去。“江永”号轮船碰到土硬搁浅停航，损坏了船舵。第四、治淮计划不能按计划完成。第五、造成了不良的政治影响，如有的民船在这里搁浅后，船上的人就气愤得大骂。第六、使国家经济受到巨大的损失。不仅被祝魁刚直接盗窃了巨额财富，而且国家还必需付出大量资金，补做工程。
    上海市人民政府已于二月十六日把祝魁刚、周滨森二犯逮捕，押到蚌埠处理。治淮委员会工程部也在二月二十日把张谨农带回机关进行围攻。（刘星）
