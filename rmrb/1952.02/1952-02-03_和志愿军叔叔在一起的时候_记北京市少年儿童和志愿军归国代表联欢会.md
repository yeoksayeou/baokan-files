    When We Were With the Volunteer Army Uncles
    ——A Record of the Beijing Municipal Children's and Volunteer Army Returning Delegation Joint Celebration
    Ye Youqin
    On the evening of January 25th, the children of the "Young Pioneer Class" at Baojia Street Elementary School were already clamoring for their mothers and sisters to bring out the new clothes they would wear for the Spring Festival. The children also remembered to put their most beloved little diaries in their pockets early. Everyone had already planned: "This time, we must get the Volunteer Army uncles and aunts to sign their names." Miao Bosheng woke up in the middle of the night, staring straight at the dark window, constantly hoping: "Hurry up and dawn!"
    Early in the morning of the 26th, the children put on their new clothes and neatly tied their red scarves. The children were more beautiful than usual. The flag of the Young Pioneers shone particularly brightly in the sunlight.
    The children themselves were the hosts of the joint celebration. Participating in the joint celebration were about eighty Young Pioneer members from a squadron of the first division of the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Elementary School and a "Young Pioneer Class" from Baojia Street Elementary School. The children waited anxiously. When four Volunteer Army uncles and aunts wearing red ribbons, big fur hats, and riding breeches walked in, the children were overjoyed. The Volunteer Army uncles and aunts whom they always saw in their dreams had really come today! The children clapped vigorously, and Wang Baohua's little hands were swollen from clapping, but he kept clapping. The joyful joint celebration began. The children stared intently at the faces of the Volunteer Army uncles and aunts. Little Qi Jiachun was the chairperson, and she was held in Aunt Gan Xiangui's arms the whole time. Her face was radiant as she told her classmates: "Aunt Gan Xiangui is holding me, and I feel an unspeakable honor and pride. I'm really happy from the bottom of my heart!" Little Wang Baohua said enviously: "At that time, I wished I could go on stage too and ask the uncles and aunts to hold me!"
    At the joint celebration, the children's performances were better than ever before, because everyone was thinking: "This is for the Volunteer Army uncles and aunts." The Young Pioneers who were presenting gifts to the Volunteer Army uncles and aunts felt particularly happy. Zhang Yarong and Wang Muxian told people: "Uncle Wei Mingliang shook hands with us when we presented the gifts! His hands were so warm, we really didn't want to come down!" Little Wang Xiuyan was extremely happy when she saw the Young Pioneer flag with small five-pointed stars and small torches that she had sewn stitch by stitch with her own hands being presented to the Volunteer Army uncles and aunts. She thought: "This flag represents all the members of our 'Young Pioneer Class.' If they take it to Korea, and the Volunteer Army uncles and aunts see it, they will kill more American devils."
    Before the chairman could say "meeting adjourned," the children swarmed onto the stage and surrounded the Volunteer Army uncles and aunts. Dozens of little heads burrowed straight into the crowd, and dozens of little hands holding diaries stretched straight into the crowd. "Let me see!" "Uncle, Aunt, please sign my name!" Everyone wanted to see clearly what the Volunteer Army uncles and aunts looked like, everyone wanted to hug and shake hands with the uncles and aunts, or even just touch their clothes! Little Wang Xisheng finally squeezed in. He thought for a moment, and then busily took out his beloved little peace dove badge and gave it to Uncle Wei Mingliang. He proudly told others: "Today my name is written on Uncle Wei Mingliang's little notebook."
    This small joint celebration left a deep impression on the children. The children will always remember Uncle Wei Mingliang's and Aunt Yu Xiangui's words to them: study hard, exercise well, and be good children of Chairman Mao.

    和志愿军叔叔在一起的时候  
    ——记北京市少年儿童和志愿军归国代表联欢会
    叶幼琴
    一月二十五日那天晚上，鲍家街小学“红领巾班”的儿童们，就吵着要妈妈姊姊们给拿出过春节穿的新衣裳。孩子们还记着把自己最喜爱的小日记本早早装在兜兜里。大家早就盘算过了：“这一回说什么也要让志愿军叔叔姑姑们签个名。”苗浡生睡到半夜就醒了，直瞅着漆黑的窗子，心里老盼念着：“快天亮吧！”
    二十六日一早起来，孩子们就穿上了新衣裳，整整齐齐地系上红领巾。孩子们比往日更美丽了。少年儿童队的队旗，在太阳光下也显得格外鲜艳。
    联欢会的主人是孩子们自己。参加联欢会的有北京师范大学附属小学第一部一个中队和鲍家街小学一个“红领巾班”，共约八十多个少年儿童队队员。孩子们焦急地等着、等着。当四个挂红条、戴大绒帽、穿马裤的志愿军叔叔姑姑走进门时，孩子们可乐开啦。老在睡梦里见到的志愿军叔叔姑姑们，今天可真来啦！孩子们使劲地鼓掌，王保华把小手拍肿了，还在拍。愉快的联欢会开始了。孩子们紧瞅着志愿军叔叔姑姑们的脸。齐家纯小朋友是主席，她一直被干宪桂姑姑抱在怀里。她满脸光彩地告诉同学们说：“干宪桂姑姑抱着我，我真有说不出的光荣和骄傲。我从心眼里乐呵！”王保华小朋友羡慕地说：“那时我恨不得也上台去叫叔叔姑姑们抱抱我！”
    在联欢会上，孩子们的节目比那一次都表演得好，因为大家都想着：“这是给志愿军叔叔姑姑们演的。”献礼给志愿军叔叔姑姑们的少年儿童，特别感到高兴。张雅蓉和王慕娴告诉人说：“献礼的时候，魏明亮叔叔和我们握手啦！他的手热极了，我们真不想下来了！”王秀艳小朋友看到把自己亲手一针针缝起的，有着小五星、小火把的少年儿童队队旗献给志愿军叔叔姑姑们时，高兴极了，她想：“这面队旗代表着我们‘红领巾班’的全体队员。把它带到朝鲜去，叫志愿军叔叔姑姑们看了，多杀几个美国鬼子。”
    主席还没说完“散会”，孩子们一哄就跳到台上，把志愿军叔叔姑姑们团团围住啦。几十个小脑袋直向人堆里钻，几十只拿着日记本的小手直向人堆里伸。“让我看一看吧！”“叔叔姑姑给我签名吧！”谁也想仔仔细细看看志愿军叔叔姑姑们长的样子，谁也想和叔叔姑姑们抱一抱，握握手，再不就摸摸叔叔姑姑们的衣服也好呵！王希圣小朋友终于挤进去了，他想了想，忙着掏出自己心爱的小和平鸽徽章送给了魏明亮叔叔。他骄傲地对别人说：“今天我的名字可写上了魏明亮叔叔的小本本上啦。”
    这个小小的联欢会，给孩子们留下了深刻的印象。孩子们会永远记着魏明亮叔叔和于宪桂姑姑嘱咐他们的话：要努力学习，好好锻炼身体，做一个毛主席的好孩子。
