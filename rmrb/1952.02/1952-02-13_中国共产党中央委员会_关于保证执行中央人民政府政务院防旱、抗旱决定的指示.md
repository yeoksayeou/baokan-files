    Instructions on Ensuring the Implementation of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's Decision on Drought Prevention and Resistance
    In view of the fact that in 1951, varying degrees of drought occurred successively in most or part of 22 provinces and regions, especially in the northern regions where there has been little rain and snow since winter, and the land is dry, drought prevention and resistance has become an urgent task. Drought prevention, resistance, and intensifying spring plowing are of decisive significance for striving for a bumper harvest in 1952 and ensuring people's food. Achieving another bumper harvest in 1952 is a powerful guarantee for realizing Chairman Mao's instruction to "increase production, practice strict economy, and support the Chinese People's Volunteers," and will enable us to be better prepared to advance towards planned economic construction. Therefore, Party committees at all levels must strive to ensure the implementation of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's decision on launching a mass drought prevention and resistance movement, and intensify leadership over spring plowing. Provincial and prefectural Party committees should designate a member of the Standing Committee who can be spared from the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and organize a number of cadres to specifically lead, supervise, and inspect this work. County Party committees should not only regard the drought prevention and resistance movement and leadership over spring plowing as one of the central tasks at present, but should also have the secretary or deputy secretary effectively lead it. Districts and townships (villages) should, from now until the completion of spring plowing, concentrate their efforts on organizing the masses to prevent and resist drought, and must ensure that they do not miss the farming season and do a good job in spring plowing. After spring plowing and sowing, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement above the county level will have been largely completed, and a group of relatively strong and experienced cadres can be sent to the countryside, and then the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement can be launched at the district and township levels. In short, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement must be carried through to the end, but do not miss the farming season and affect spring plowing because of this, otherwise you will commit a greater and more serious bureaucratic error.

    中国共产党中央委员会
    关于保证执行中央人民政府政务院防旱、抗旱决定的指示
    鉴于一九五一年在二十二个省区中曾有大部或局部地区先后发生轻重不同的旱灾，特别是北方地区入冬以来雨雪稀少，土地干旱，防旱、抗旱已成为当前的紧急任务。防旱、抗旱和加紧春耕工作对于争取一九五二年的农产丰收，保证民食是有决定意义的。而一九五二年再一次取得农产丰收就是实现毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的指示之有力的保证，就能使我们有更好准备的向计划经济建设前进。因此，各级党委必须努力保证中央人民政府政务院关于开展群众性防旱、抗旱运动决定的贯彻实施，并加紧领导春耕工作。省委、地委应指定能从反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中抽出手来的常委一人，并组织若干干部，专门负责领导督促检查这一工作。县委不仅应把防旱、抗旱运动和领导春耕工作做为当前的中心工作之一，并应由书记或副书记切实负责领导之。区乡（村）则应自即日起直至春耕完成后为止，集中力量组织群众防旱、抗旱，必须保证不违农时，做好春耕。在春耕下种之后，届时县以上的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动也将大体完成，可以有一批比较强而有经验的干部派到农村中去，然后再在区乡两级展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动。总之，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动是必须贯彻到底的，但切勿因此而违农时，影响春耕，否则就要犯更大而更严重的官僚主义错误。
