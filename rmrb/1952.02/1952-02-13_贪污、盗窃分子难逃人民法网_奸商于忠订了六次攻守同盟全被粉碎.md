    Corrupt and Thieving Elements Cannot Escape the Net of the People's Law
    Cunning Merchant Yu Zhong's Six Pacts of Mutual Defense Were All Shattered
    To the Editor: Yu Zhong, the deputy manager of the Beijing Publicly-Operated Eastern Suburban Brewery, has consistently stolen state property. Before May of last year, this factory was still privately owned, and at that time, Yu Zhong privately bought and sold approximately 200 taels of gold and evaded over 10 million yuan in state taxes. These are only the preliminary materials that have been uncovered. When the factory processed for the China油脂 Company, Yu Zhong underreported the amount of oil produced and embezzled the remaining oil. He once "borrowed" 3 million yuan to Li Zongyi, a retained employee of the Central Trade Department, and then asked Li Zongyi to steal economic intelligence from the National油脂 Conference. After stealing the plans of the油脂 Conference, he told Manager Tian of the Beijing Oil Factory, "When processing for the state, no one should hand over the remaining oil." He also told this situation to factories related to him. He made preparations as soon as this movement began. He discussed with Li Zongyi, and Li said, "I'll hurry to gather money for you, as a loan relationship." He told Li Zongyi not to confess to stealing economic intelligence. They made six pacts of mutual defense after the movement began. But this trick could not escape the eyes of all the workers in the factory. On February 2nd, the factory held a struggle meeting. Through the workers' continuous attacks, coupled with the Central Trade Department sending people to the factory for inspection, the pact of mutual defense arranged by Yu Zhong was finally shattered.

    贪污、盗窃分子难逃人民法网
    奸商于忠订了六次攻守同盟全被粉碎
    编辑同志：北京公营东郊啤酒厂副经理于忠一贯偷盗国家财产。这个厂在去年五月以前，还是私营工厂，当时于忠私行买卖黄金约二百两，偷漏国家税款一千多万元，这些还只是初步查出的材料。该厂为中国油脂公司加工时，于忠少报出油数量，侵吞剩下的油。他曾“借”给中央贸易部留用人员李宗义三百万元，然后要李宗义盗窃全国油脂会议的经济情报。他窃得了油脂会议的计划后，就对北京油厂田经理说：“为国家加工时，谁也别交剩下的油。”他还把这种情况，告给和他有关的工厂。这次运动一开始，他就做了准备。他和李宗义商量，李说：“我赶紧凑钱给你，算是借贷关系。”他让李宗义不要坦白偷窃经济情报的事。他们在运动开始后，订了六次攻守同盟。但是这种诡计逃不过全厂工人的眼睛。二月二日，这个厂开了一次斗争大会。经过工人的不断进攻，再加上中央贸易部派人来厂检查，于忠所布置的攻守同盟终于被打碎了。
