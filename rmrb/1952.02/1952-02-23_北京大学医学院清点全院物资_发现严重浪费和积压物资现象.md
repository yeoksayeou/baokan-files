To the Editor: Peking University Medical College recently inventoried the entire college's property and uncovered a large number of wasteful practices. In total, our college has wasted over 4.8 billion yuan of the people's assets, and the phenomenon of stockpiled materials is very serious. The Bacteriology Department has a high-altitude vacuum pump that has never been used since it was purchased several years ago. There are eighty-three dental examination chairs, but only forty-three are in use; this item alone has accumulated over 200 million yuan in capital. The Biochemistry Department has stockpiled over a hundred types of valuable physical instruments and over 300 pounds of acetone. Last year, only a little over four pounds were used. At this rate, these 300 pounds of acetone could last for seventy years. The entire college only needs two cameras, but each department has at least one or two (the Anatomy Department recently bought another one). The Pharmacy Department has a slide projector that has never been used, but another department bought one from outside. In late 1950, the medical college rushed to purchase over 700 million yuan worth of materials in three days, many of which were unsuitable. The Pharmacology Department's refractometer, worth 40 million yuan, and the fifteen motors, worth 100 million yuan, and two hundred machine heads, worth 60 million yuan, in the Department of Stomatology were all substandard. The Bacteriology Department's high-pressure sterilizer, worth only 4 million yuan, was purchased at an inflated price of 9 million yuan. Losses caused by careless use of equipment are also very serious. Pharmacy students damaged instruments worth 17 million yuan during experiments in 1950. The losses in basic construction are even greater. The heating equipment in the buildings that were constructed is completely unusable, resulting in a loss of over 200 million yuan. Other losses due to poor design or theft by unscrupulous merchants amount to 1.2 billion yuan. The reason why Peking University Medical College has such serious waste is inseparable from the school leadership's bureaucratic style, "ostentation" mentality, and departmentalism. Through this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, our school will thoroughly eliminate these bad phenomena.

### 北京大学医学院清点全院物资  发现严重浪费和积压物资现象

    北京大学医学院清点全院物资
    发现严重浪费和积压物资现象
    编辑同志：北京大学医学院最近清点了全院的物资，揭发了大量的浪费事实。总计我院浪费人民的资财达四十八亿多元，积压物资的现象非常严重。细菌科有一架高空抽气机，买来数年，一回也没有用过；有检查口腔椅八十三台，使用的只有四十三台，光这一项就积压资金二亿多元。生化科积压着贵重物理仪器百余种，积存丙酮三百多磅，去年只用四磅多，依此推算，这三百多磅丙酮可用七十年。全院有两架照相机就够用了，但是每科至少有一两架（解剖科最近又买了一架）。药学系有幻灯机一架从未用过，但是另外有一科又从外边买回了一架。一九五○年底医学院方面在三天的时间里，抢购了七亿多元的物资，其中有很多是不适用的。药理系的价值四千万元的折光器，以及口腔医学系的价值一亿元的十五架电机和价值六千万元的两百个机头，都是不合规格的。细菌科的高压蒸锅只值四百万元，却以九百万元的高价购进。在使用器物的时候，因使用不慎造成的损失也很严重。药学系同学，一九五○年实验时损坏的仪器，其价值达一千七百万元。在基本建设方面的损失数字更大，所建楼房的暖气设备，全部不能用，损失了两亿多元，其他因设计不周，或为奸商偷盗而损失的达十二亿元。北京大学医学院之所以有这样严重的浪费，是和我校领导方面的官僚主义作风、“好排场”思想和本位主义分不开的。通过这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，我校将彻底清除这些恶劣现象。  北京大学医学院节约检查委员会
