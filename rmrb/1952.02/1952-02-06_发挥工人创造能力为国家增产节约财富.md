Workers Jia Jixin et al. Successfully Modified Furnaces, Saving the State Over 700 Million Yuan Annually

To the Editor: Workers Jia Jixin and Er Xiangrong from the Dezhou General Station of the State-owned North China Transportation Company modified charcoal furnaces into anthracite coal furnaces, saving the state 720 million yuan annually. In October of last year, electrician Jia Jixin accepted the task of modifying charcoal furnaces into anthracite coal furnaces. He diligently studied various anthracite coal furnace designs and principles, and designed a new anthracite coal furnace blueprint. Er Xiangrong, the head of the ironworker team, and others studied the blueprint and completed the modification plan. Comrades Jia and Er installed the anthracite coal furnace on the vehicle. After testing, they found that there was insufficient gas in the furnace, and the anthracite coal burned into coke residue, making it impossible to drive. To correct this problem, they opened two air inlets in the lower part of the furnace to aid the combustion of anthracite coal. To increase the engine's explosive power, they also made seven intersecting air nozzles and placed them around the furnace, and converted the dispersed air intake into a concentrated喇叭-shaped air intake, thus overcoming the problems of insufficient gas and weak explosive power during driving. However, they were not complacent. They modified the internal steam chamber into a more material-saving and practical external steam chamber; they also modified the air intake nozzle, further increasing the engine's explosive power. After several tests, the modified anthracite coal furnace was finally successful. During the modification process, the deputy head of the station once said: "Don't mess around! You should go to Shanghai to see the modified furnaces there." Some backward workers also said: "If you can't modify it, don't bother, lest you waste state assets." Jia Jixin did not lose heart. He just thought: "I am a Communist Party member, I must successfully modify the anthracite coal furnace." According to the station's preliminary calculations, using anthracite coal furnaces saves three and a half times the cost of using charcoal furnaces, saving the state 720 million yuan annually.

Technician at the Repair Shop of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau Laboratory

Successfully Assembled Three-Phase 75-Ampere Kilowatt-Hour Meters, Costing Only One-Quarter of Foreign Products

To the Editor: The employees of the repair shop of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau Laboratory have demonstrated their work enthusiasm and successfully assembled three-phase 75-ampere kilowatt-hour meters (commonly known as horsepower meters). Three-phase kilowatt-hour meters are instruments used to calculate the amount of power used for industrial purposes. They have a complex internal structure and require delicate parts. In the past, these kilowatt-hour meters were all imported from foreign countries, requiring a lot of foreign exchange each year. After liberation, kilowatt-hour meters were expensive and not easy to buy. The employees of the repair shop decided to try assembling them. At the beginning of their work, they encountered many difficulties, such as the lack of tools and suitable models. After continuous research, they manufactured twenty tools and models. They tried to make the most of waste materials. For example, the permanent magnets in the parts were made from old parts from damaged kilowatt-hour meters; the faceplates and faceplate noses were made from kilowatt-hour meter casings and waste kilowatt-hour meter bottom covers. They worked closely with the technical personnel. For example, in order to reduce the value of the starting current, they discussed and studied ways to reduce the starting current to below the standard value. In this way, they finally successfully assembled three-phase 75-ampere kilowatt-hour meters. According to the results of the testing group, the quality of the assembled kilowatt-hour meters met the requirements, and the cost was only one-quarter of that of foreign products.

Technician Ruan Mengwu of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine

Successfully Experimented with an Electric Shovel Combined Coal Loading Machine, Increasing Production by More Than 10,000 Tons of Grain Annually

To the Editor: On December 31st of last year, Ruan Mengwu, a technician at the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, successfully experimented with an electric shovel combined coal loading machine, which can save the state over 11,500 tons of grain annually. For forty years, this mine was controlled by British imperialism and the Kuomintang bandits. They never improved the backward method of carrying coal in baskets, which seriously damaged the workers' health. After liberation, the Party and the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government proposed to completely reform the backward method of carrying coal in baskets. After many studies, no result was achieved. In December of last year, Minister Chen Yu of the Ministry of Fuel Industry came to the mine to guide the work and raised this issue again. At that time, Ruan Mengwu guaranteed to Minister Chen that he would realize the reform of the method of carrying coal in baskets in the first quarter of this year. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the workers, this guarantee was finally realized. The electric shovel combined coal loading machine is composed of an electric winch, a coal loading machine, and an electric shovel. The electric shovel combined coal loading machine can directly load coal onto trains, transporting three tons of coal each time, twice per minute, a total of six tons, and three hundred and sixty tons per hour. Based on eighteen hours per day (three shifts), it can transport six thousand four hundred and eighty tons of coal. The electric shovel combined coal loading machine only requires six people to operate it smoothly. Its efficiency is ten times higher than carrying coal in baskets. According to this year's production tasks, based on this number, it is estimated that it can increase production and save more than 11,500 tons of grain annually.

Ma Wanshui Team of the Longyan Iron Mine

Improved Operating Methods and Maximized Mechanical Efficiency, Creating a New Excavation Record in December of Last Year

To the Editor: The team led by Ma Wanshui, a labor model of the Longyan Iron Mine in Xuanhua City, created a new record of excavating 74.115 meters in one month in December of last year. From March to August of last year, this team had already created the mine's new excavation record five consecutive times. During the patriotic red flag emulation campaign, the workers of the Ma Wanshui team responded to Chairman Mao's call for increasing production and practicing economy, demonstrating a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity, and combining technical theory with practical work. They developed an operating method of drilling and blasting in stages, with four blasts per shift. This operating method can fully utilize labor and maximize mechanical efficiency; even under the condition of poor detonators, it will not affect the progress of excavation. Because the operating procedures of this method are arranged tightly, it basically eliminates wasted work hours and work-related accidents. In December, this team excavated 27.07 meters in the shale layer, 13.035 meters in the quartzite layer, and 34.01 meters in the phyllite layer, for a total of 74.115 meters.

    发挥工人创造能力为国家增产节约财富
    工人贾际新等改制燃炉成功每年可为国家节省七亿多元
    编辑同志：国营华北区运输公司德州总站工人贾际新、耳向荣把木炭炉改制为白煤炉，每年可替国家节约七亿二千万元。去年十月，电工贾际新接受了把木炭炉改制为白煤炉的任务，他便根据各种白煤炉的图样、原理，苦心钻研，设计出白煤炉的新图样。铁工组组长耳向荣等研究了这个图样，并完成了改制计划。贾、耳等同志把白煤炉安装在车上。经过试车，他们发觉炉内煤气不多，所烧的白煤被炼成焦渣，不能行车。为了纠正这个毛病，他们把炉膛下部打开了两个进风口，以帮助白煤的燃烧。为了提高引擎的爆发力，他们又制成七个互相交差的进风嘴子，安置在炉膛周围，并把分散式吸风口改装成集中的喇叭式吸风口，这样就克服了行车时煤气少、爆发力弱的毛病。但他们并不因此自满，他们把内型蒸气室改装成又省料、又适用的外型蒸气室；改造了进风嘴，更增加了引擎的爆发力。经过数次的试验，改制白煤炉终于成功了。在改制过程中，副总站长曾说：“别乱搞了！你们还是到上海看看人家改好的炉吧。”有的落后工人也说：“改不了别改，免得浪费国家资产。”贾际新毫不灰心，他只是想：“我是个共产党员，一定把白煤炉改制成功。”据这个站的初步计算，用白煤炉后，较用木炭炉节省费用三倍半，全年可为国家节约七亿二千万元。

    配制三相七五安培电度表成功所需成本只有外货的四分之一
    编辑同志：天津电业局试验室修表场职工发挥了工作积极性，配制三相七五安培电度表（俗称马力表）成功。三相电度表是计算动力用电多少的仪器，内部构造复杂，需细致的零件。过去，这些电度表都由外国输入，每年需要很多外汇。解放后，电度表的售价很高，且不容易买到。修表场职工决定试行配制。在工作开始时，他们遭到了不少困难，如没有工具和缺乏适当的模型等。经过不断的钻研，他们制造了工具、模型二十件。他们尽量做到废物利用。比如零件中的永久磁铁，是利用残毁电度表内的旧物；口圈和口圈鼻子，都是利用电度表外套匣子及废电表大底盖造成。他们和技术人员结合得很紧密，例如，为了要减少启动电流的数值，大家就讨论研究，使启动电流降到标准值下。这样，他们终于把三相七五安培电度表配制成功了。据试表组试验结果，制成的电度表的质量合乎规定，而所需成本则只为外国货的四分之一。

    焦作煤矿技师阮孟武
    实验电扒联合装煤机成功一年增产可达一万多吨粮食
    编辑同志：去年十二月三十一日，焦作煤矿技师阮孟武实验电扒联合装煤机成功，一年可为国家增产节约一万一千五百多吨粮食。这个矿被英帝国主义和国民党匪帮掌握了四十年，他们对落后的抬筐运搬操作方法，从来没有改进过，因此，严重地损害了工人的健康。解放后，党和中央人民政府燃料工业部就提出了要彻底改革落后的抬筐运搬方法。经过多次的研究，一直没有得到结果。去年十二月，燃料工业部陈郁部长来矿指导工作，又提出了这个问题。当时，阮孟武向陈部长作了保证，要在今年第一季实现改革抬筐运搬的方法。在党的领导和职工的帮助下，这一保证终于实现了。电扒联合装煤机是由电绞车、装煤机和电扒等组成的。电扒联合装煤机能直接把煤装到火车上，每次运煤三吨，每分钟运两次，共六吨，每小时运三百六十吨煤。每天按十八小时计算（三班），可运搬六千四百八十吨煤。电扒联合装煤机只需要六个人操作，就能很如意地运用起来，它的效率比抬筐运搬高十倍。按今年的生产任务，根据这个数字估计，一年可增产节约一万一千五百多吨粮食。

    龙烟铁矿马万水小组
    改进操作方法发挥机械效能去年十二月份创掘进新纪录
    编辑同志：宣化市龙烟铁矿劳动模范马万水领导的小组，在去年十二月份创一个月掘进七十四点一一五公尺的新纪录。去年三月至八月，这个小组已连续五次创造了这个矿的掘进新纪录。在爱国主义红旗竞赛运动中，马万水小组的工人响应了毛主席增产节约的号召，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，把技术理论和实际工作结合起来。他们研究出边打边放、每班放四次炮的操作方法。这个操作方法，能够充分使用劳动力和发挥机械效能；即使在雷管不好的条件下，也不致影响掘进的进度。由于这种方法的操作程序排列得紧凑，因而基本上消灭了浪费工时和工伤事故。这个小组在十二月份里，在粘板岩矿层掘进二十七点零七公尺，在石英岩矿层掘进十三点零三五公尺，在千页岩矿层掘进三十四点○一公尺，一共掘进了七十四点一一五公尺。
