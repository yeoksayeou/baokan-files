The heroic anti-imperialist struggle waged by the Egyptian people for national independence and freedom since last October has recently suffered a temporary setback due to the Egyptian reactionary ruling clique's blatant betrayal of national interests and its capitulation and compromise with imperialism. On January 27, Egyptian King Farouk, on the grounds that "the government's strength is insufficient to maintain security and order," dismissed the Wafd Party's Nahas government and appointed pro-British politician Maher to form a new cabinet. After taking office, Maher immediately adopted strict measures to carry out a shameless bloody suppression of the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist struggle. Countless Egyptian patriotic people were arrested and illegally interrogated. The Maher government also openly colluded with US and British imperialism, actively paving the way for the resumption of Anglo-Egyptian negotiations and preparing for discussions on the so-called "Middle East Command" issue. This change of the Egyptian cabinet and the transformation of the Egyptian political situation are obviously the result of the US and British imperialism's tyrannical interference in Egypt's internal affairs and the Egyptian reactionary ruling clique's capitulation and compromise with imperialism.

(I)

Since the Egyptian government, under the firm demands and pressure of the Egyptian people, decided to abolish the unequal Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 and the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement of 1899, the Egyptian people's movement to strive for national independence and autonomy has risen day by day on an unprecedented scale. Under the slogan of "Drive British imperialism out!", people from all walks of life in Egypt, led by the working class, widely participated in the patriotic struggle. Many Egyptian national industrialists and businessmen also supported the workers, students, and other patriotic people's anti-imperialist struggle by boycotting British goods and refusing to supply British troops with supplies. In these three months, the people of Egypt held countless large-scale demonstrations and marches with hundreds of thousands or even millions of people. The British imperialist army's bloody suppression of the Egyptian people further developed the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist movement into a mass armed resistance struggle. Many workers, students, youth, and women angrily took up arms to fight back against the bloody attacks of British imperialism. Even the auxiliary police of Ismailia, influenced by the heroic struggle of the Egyptian patriotic people, bravely resisted the frantic attacks of the British invading army until their ammunition was exhausted and reinforcements failed to arrive. The Egyptian people's boundless anger and hatred towards imperialism, which had been suppressed for more than seventy years, erupted like a huge mountain torrent, rushing towards the imperialist enemy with overwhelming force.

However, in this anti-imperialist movement, the Egyptian ruling clique has always adopted a very ambiguous attitude. The main reason why it had to decide to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty last October was due to the firm demands and strong pressure of the vast majority of the Egyptian people. The anti-British measures taken by the Egyptian ruling class in the past three months have actually been very weak. On the one hand, it only made some diplomatic protests to the British government and dared not resolutely submit the issue of British tyrannical infringement on Egyptian territorial sovereignty to the United Nations Security Council, and it still maintained close ties with the US and British officials; on the other hand, it dared not let the Egyptian people, who had already taken active action, to carry out further struggle, and from time to time, it used the prohibition of gatherings and demonstrations and martial law to impose various restrictions.

(II)

British and US imperialism adopted extremely shameless policies of bloody suppression and sabotage against the Egyptian people's struggle for national independence and autonomy. Since Egypt announced the abolition of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, British imperialism has continuously transferred large numbers of troops from Cyprus and its own country to Egypt to carry out armed massacres of the Egyptian people, and shamelessly took the opportunity to expand its occupied areas in the Suez Canal region. The British army used tanks and artillery fire to raze Egyptian villages, and even used jet aircraft and poisonous gas bullets to attack the Egyptian people, showing the ferocious face of an imperialist aggressor to the Egyptian people, attempting to carry out intimidation and threats.

While British imperialism was brutally suppressing the Egyptian people, US imperialism was coercing and deceiving the Egyptian reactionary ruling class, which originally held a two-faced attitude. On October 17 last year, shortly after the Egyptian government decided to abolish the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, US Secretary of State Acheson shamelessly claimed that Egypt's actions "affected the security and defense of the important Middle East region" and expressed his intention to propose a new suggestion to enable the British and Egyptian sides to reach an "agreement." Later, the US Information Service revealed the content of this suggestion: "The Egyptian government obtains sovereignty over Sudan, which is currently jointly administered with Britain, and it should, in principle, agree to participate in the Middle East Command." This means that the United States attempted to use the "return" of Sudan to Egypt as bait in exchange for the Egyptian ruling clique's compromise with imperialism, in order to further suppress the national liberation movements of Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries. After Acheson issued his statement, the United States instigated the reactionary kings and prime ministers of Saudi Arabia and Iraq to come forward to carry out "mediation" activities, while US Ambassador to Cairo Caffery maintained close contact with the Egyptian King directly, demanding that the Egyptian King replace the Nahas government and try to reopen "negotiations" with Britain and participate in discussions on the "Middle East Command" issue.

(III)

Due to the US and British imperialism's tyrannical interference in Egypt's internal affairs and the Egyptian reactionary ruling clique's own fear of the constantly growing strength of the Egyptian people's struggle, the Egyptian ruling clique changed from hesitation and wavering to finally capitulating and compromising with US and British imperialism. Last December, Egyptian King Farouk, disregarding the opposition of the Egyptian people, appointed pro-British politicians Amir and Afifi as his "Privy Councilors," and began to discuss the steps of compromise behind the scenes. On January 6 this year, the Egyptian Constitutional Liberal Party, which had close ties with Afifi, issued a statement attacking the Wafd Party government for "taking extremely chaotic steps." Under these circumstances, the Nahas government's two-faced policy in the anti-imperialist struggle could no longer be maintained. On the one hand, it could not resolutely rely on the Egyptian people, and on the other hand, it dared not take overly blatant repressive measures against the people's revolutionary struggle, making it inconvenient for Egyptian King Farouk and his confidants to openly surrender and compromise with imperialism. Therefore, not long after, Egyptian newspapers and foreign news agencies continuously reported the news that Egyptian King Farouk was going to replace the Wafd Party government. On January 27, after saboteurs bought by imperialism and pro-British politicians in Egypt deliberately set fire to some British industries in Cairo, Farouk dismissed it on the pretext that the Wafd Party government was unable to maintain order.

Once the Egyptian reactionary ruling clique violated the will of the people and decided to compromise with US and British imperialism, it immediately turned around and took blatant reactionary measures against the Egyptian people, openly helping imperialism suppress the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist struggle. On January 27, Maher delivered a radio address to the country after taking office, blatantly expressing his anti-people attitude. He said: "In addition to the national issue, we have huge tasks before us. We must establish and maintain law and order at home." Then the Maher government began to search for and arrest a large number of patriots across the country, and disarmed the armed forces scattered among the Egyptian people with the military police. On January 30, Maher openly expressed "willingness to discuss the Middle East Command issue with the four countries." Recently, Agence France-Presse also claimed that after Maher and the British Ambassador to Egypt met on the 25th of this month, Anglo-Egyptian negotiations will be announced to begin. The "Middle East Command" issue will also be discussed. In addition to the United States, Britain, France, Turkey and Egypt, there will also be representatives from other Arab countries. All these facts have clearly shown that the Egyptian ruling clique is now rapidly throwing itself into the arms of US and British imperialism and openly selling out the interests of the Egyptian nation.

(IV)

The fact that the Egyptian reactionary ruling clique openly sold itself to US and British imperialism, and that it turned around to suppress the Egyptian people's struggle together with US and British imperialism, will temporarily place the constantly developing Egyptian people's anti-imperialist patriotic movement in a more difficult and unfavorable position than before. But the imperialists' and Egyptian reactionary ruling clique's conspiracy to suppress the Egyptian national liberation movement is bound to fail in the end. The US and British imperialists' conspiracy to undermine the Egyptian national liberation movement by despicable means will surely make the Egyptian people more aware of the vicious faces of the invaders; and the Egyptian reactionary ruling clique's betrayal to imperialism will inevitably expose the contradictions between it and the Egyptian people, which have been temporarily hidden for more than three months, and will make the Egyptian patriotic people more vigilant and strengthen their unity to continue the struggle for independence and freedom. The fact is very obvious that although the Egyptian reactionary ruling clique can use "negotiations" to resolve some conflicts of interest between it and imperialism, the contradiction between the Egyptian people and imperialism can never be resolved by means of "negotiations." Because this is a deep and huge contradiction between the imperialist oppressors and the oppressed colonial nations; if Egypt is finally dragged into the Middle East aggressive bloc and Egypt's territory is occupied by more imperialists and their accomplice armies, this contradiction will be further expanded. It can be believed that until the imperialist aggressive forces are completely driven out, and until the Egyptian people have achieved true independence and freedom, this contradiction can never be resolved.

The blood of the Egyptian people's anti-imperialist struggle for more than three months will never be shed in vain. The heroic struggle during this period has sown countless revolutionary seeds in the hearts of the dockworkers of Suez and the residents of Ismailia, and in the streets of the Nile Delta and Alexandria. No matter how ferocious and tyrannical the imperialist reactionary forces that attempt to destroy them are today, these revolutionary seeds, irrigated and cultivated with the blood of the Egyptian people, will surely germinate, take root, and finally blossom into flowers of freedom and bear the fruits of victory under the sunshine of justice and truth on the fertile land of this ancient civilization.

### 埃及人民反帝爱国斗争的新形势

    埃及人民反帝爱国斗争的新形势
    自去年十月以来，埃及人民为争取民族独立自由而进行的轰轰烈烈的反帝国主义斗争，最近由于埃及反动统治集团公然出卖民族利益，向帝国主义屈膝妥协，而受到了暂时的挫折。一月二十七日，埃及国王法鲁克以“政府力量不足以维持安全与秩序”为理由，罢黜了华夫脱党的纳哈斯政府，并任命亲英政客马赫尔组成了新的内阁。马赫尔登台以后，立即采取严峻措施，对埃及人民的反帝斗争实行无耻的血腥镇压，无数的埃及爱国志士因而就横遭逮捕并被非法审讯。马赫尔政府并与美英帝国主义进行公开的勾结，积极地为恢复英埃谈判与准备举行所谓“中东司令部”问题的讨论而铺设道路。这次埃及内阁的更迭与埃及政治形势的转变，显然是由于美英帝国主义对埃及内政实行横暴干涉，与埃及反动统治集团对帝国主义投降妥协的结果。
    （一）
    自从埃及政府在埃及全国人民的坚决要求与压力之下，决定废除一九三六年的英埃不平等条约与一八九九年的英埃共管苏丹协定以后，埃及人民争取民族独立自主的运动就以前所未有的规模一天比一天地高涨起来。在“把英帝国主义赶出去！”的口号之下，以工人阶级为首的埃及各阶层人民广泛地参加了爱国斗争的行列，许多埃及的民族工商业者也用抵制英货与拒绝供应英军物资的行动来支持工人、学生与其他爱国人士的反帝国主义斗争。在这三个多月内，埃及各地人民曾举行过无数次的人数达几十万以至成百万的大规模的示威游行，而英帝国主义军队对埃及人民的血腥镇压，则更使埃及人民的反帝运动发展成为群众性的武装反抗斗争。许多工人、学生、青年、妇女都愤怒地拿起了武器来反击英帝国主义的血腥进攻，甚至连伊士美利亚城的辅助警察，也因为受了埃及爱国人民英勇斗争的影响，曾向疯狂进攻的英国侵略军队进行了英勇的抵抗，直到弹尽援绝为止。埃及人民积压了七十多年之久的对于帝国主义的无边愤怒与仇恨，就像一股巨大的山洪一样爆发出来，以排山倒海之势冲向了帝国主义敌人。
    但是在这一反对帝国主义的运动中，埃及的统治集团却一直采取着十分暧昧的态度。它之所以不得不在去年十月决定废除英埃条约，主要是由于埃及广大人民的坚决要求与强大压力的结果。而埃及统治阶级在这三个多月来所采取的反英措施，实际上是十分软弱的。它一方面只对英国政府提出一些只限于外交上的抗议，而不敢坚决地把英国横暴侵犯埃及领土主权的问题提交联合国安理会，并且仍与美英官方保持着千丝万缕的联系；一方面又不敢放手地让已经积极行动起来的埃及人民作进一步的斗争，而不时地以禁止集会游行及戒严令来加以多方面的限制。
    （二）
    英美帝国主义对埃及人民争取民族独立自主的斗争，采取了极端无耻的血腥镇压和破坏的政策。英帝国主义自埃及宣布废除了英埃条约以后，就从塞浦路斯岛与本国陆续调了大批军队到埃及去，对埃及人民实行武装屠杀，并且无耻地乘机扩大其在苏彝士运河地区的占领区。英国军队用坦克与炮火来夷平了埃及的村庄，甚至还使用了喷气飞机与毒气枪弹来进攻埃及人民，对埃及人民摆出了一付帝国主义侵略者的凶相，妄图施行恫吓和威胁。
    与英帝国主义横暴镇压埃及人民的同时，美帝国主义就对本来抱着两面态度的埃及反动统治阶级施行胁迫与诱骗。去年十月十七日，当埃及政府决定废除英埃条约以后不久，美国国务卿艾奇逊就无耻地声称埃及的行动“影响到重要的中东地区的安全与防御”，并表示要提出一个新建议来使得英埃双方达成“协议”。其后美国新闻处透露出了这个建议的内容：“埃及政府取得它对目前与英国共管的苏丹的主权，而它则应该在原则上同意参加中东司令部”。这就是说，美国企图以苏丹“归还”埃及为诱饵，来换取埃及统治集团对帝国主义的妥协，以便进一步来镇压埃及和中东各国人民的民族解放运动。在艾奇逊发表声明以后，美国一面唆使沙特阿拉伯与伊拉克的反动国王和首相出面进行“斡旋”活动，一面由美国驻开罗大使加佛利直接与埃及国王保持着密切的接触，要求埃及国王撤换纳哈斯政府，并设法与英国重开“谈判”和参加关于“中东司令部”问题的讨论。
    （三）
    由于美英帝国主义对于埃及内政的横暴干涉和埃及反动的统治集团本身对于埃及人民斗争力量不断增长的恐惧，使得埃及统治集团由犹豫动摇，而终于开始向美英帝国主义投降妥协。去年十二月，埃及国王法鲁克不顾埃及人民的反对，任命亲英政客艾密尔与阿非非为其“枢密大臣”，开始在幕后商讨妥协的步骤。今年一月六日，与阿非非有着密切关系的埃及立宪自由党发表声明，攻击华夫脱党政府“采取的步骤极为混乱”。在这种情形下，纳哈斯政府在反帝斗争中的两面政策已经不能继续维持了，一方面它既不能坚决依靠埃及人民，另一方面它又不敢对人民的革命斗争采取过分露骨的镇压措施，使埃及国王法鲁克及其亲信分子公开向帝国主义投降妥协感到不便。因而，此后不久，埃及报纸与外国通讯社就连续地传出了埃及国王法鲁克将要撤换华夫脱党政府的消息。一月二十七日，在帝国主义和埃及亲英政客所收买的破坏分子故意纵火焚烧了开罗的一些英国产业以后，法鲁克就藉口华夫脱党政府无力维持秩序而将其撤换。
    在埃及反动统治集团一经违反人民意志而决定向美英帝国主义妥协以后，就立刻转过身来对埃及人民采取露骨的反动措施，公开地帮助帝国主义镇压埃及人民的反帝斗争。一月二十七日，马赫尔在上任后对全国发表广播演说，露骨地表明了他的反人民的态度，他说：“我们面前除了民族问题以外还有巨大的任务，我们必须在国内确立并维持法律和秩序。”接着马赫尔政府就开始在全国搜捕大批爱国者，并以军警解除散布于埃及人民手中的武装。一月三十日，马赫尔又公然表示“愿意和四国讨论中东司令部的问题”。最近法新社又称：在马赫尔和英国驻埃大使在本月二十五日会商以后，英埃谈判就要宣布开始。“中东司令部”的问题也即将讨论，参加者除美、英、法、土耳其和埃及以外，尚有其他的阿拉伯国家的代表。这一切事实，都已十分清楚地说明了：埃及统治集团现在正在急速地投向美英帝国主义的怀抱，公然地出卖埃及民族的利益了。
    （四）
    埃及反动统治集团公开地向美英帝国主义卖身投靠，和它转过身来与美英帝国主义一起镇压埃及人民斗争的事实，将使正在不断发展中的埃及人民反帝爱国运动暂时处于比较以前更为艰难与不利的地位。但是帝国主义与埃及反动统治集团这种镇压埃及民族解放运动的阴谋，最后是必然要遭到失败的。美英帝国主义用卑劣手段来破坏埃及民族解放运动的阴谋，一定会使埃及人民更加认清侵略者的恶毒面目；而埃及反动统治集团对帝国主义的卖身投靠，也必然会使三个多月以来曾经暂时隐蔽着的它和埃及人民之间的矛盾公开暴露出来，使埃及爱国人民更加提高警惕和加强团结，来继续进行争取独立自由的斗争。事实是很明显的，埃及反动统治集团尽管可以用“谈判”的方式来解决它和帝国主义之间的一些利害冲突，但是埃及人民和帝国主义之间的矛盾却永远不是什么“谈判”之类的方式所能解决的。因为这是帝国主义压迫者和殖民地被压迫民族之间的深刻而巨大的矛盾；如果埃及将来终于被拖入了中东侵略集团而使埃及的领土被更多的帝国主义及其帮凶军队侵占的话，这种矛盾就会更加扩大起来。可以相信，不到帝国主义侵略势力被完全赶出去的时候，不到埃及人民取得真正的独立自由的时候，这种矛盾是永远不能得到解决的。
    三个多月以来埃及人民反帝斗争的鲜血是绝不会白流的，这一时期轰轰烈烈的斗争，已经在苏彝士城的码头工人和伊士美利亚居民的心里，在尼罗河三角洲和亚历山大港的街头播下了无数颗的革命种子，不管企图摧残它们的帝国主义反动势力在今天是如何地凶恶横暴，这些用埃及人民的鲜血灌溉和栽培起来的革命种子，在正义和真理的阳光的照耀下，必将在这个文明古国的肥沃的土地上发芽、生根，并在最后开出自由的花朵，结出胜利的果实来。
