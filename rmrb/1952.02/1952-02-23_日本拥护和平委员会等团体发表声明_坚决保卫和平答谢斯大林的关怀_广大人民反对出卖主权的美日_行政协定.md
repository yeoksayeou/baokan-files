Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd dispatch from Tokyo: Leading figures from Japanese progressive mass organizations, labor unions, and farmers' associations warmly welcome Stalin's New Year's greetings to the Japanese people.

    The Japanese Peace Advocacy Committee's statement says: The Soviet leader's profound hope and belief in the freedom and independence of Japan is the greatest encouragement to the Japanese people. The statement emphasizes: In order to strive for the freedom and stable lives of the Japanese people, and to strive for Japan's independence, we once again call on patriots to unite and resolutely defend peace. To peacefully resolve the problems of all countries in the world, we strongly demand that the five major powers conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible and satisfactorily resolve the Japanese issue.

    The Pan-National Peace Patriotic Movement Council issued a statement saying: Stalin's New Year's greetings to the Japanese people are frank words spoken by the Soviet people out of deep sympathy for the Japanese people. We are willing to accept it sincerely and joyfully. The statement points out: The Japanese people, who have been under long-term occupation, are, as Marshal Stalin pointed out, in dire straits. The first wish of all Japanese people who cherish the Japanese land and nation is to be liberated from the state of occupation—the rule of foreign troops—as soon as possible, and to restore full national independence and freedom. The statement further says: Independence like that of the former "Manchukuo" is not what the Japanese people want. The majority of Japanese people strongly oppose foreign troops occupying military bases in Japan in order to invade Asia, turning Japan into an Asian arsenal, and rearming Japan. The statement concludes: In order to be liberated from the state of occupation, we must unite all forces and rise up to fight. To thank Stalin for his New Year's greetings, we pledge to unite the peace forces of the world and concentrate all our efforts on the struggle to defend Japan's independence and peace.

    The Japanese National Relief Association also issued a statement on January 9, saying: The Japanese people accept Stalin's New Year's greetings with excitement and gratitude. The statement also says: In Japan, in the past year alone, more than 1,700 people have been arrested and imprisoned for fighting for Japan's independence and peace. The work of rescuing these patriots and their families is increasingly becoming a personal movement for more people. The statement emphasizes: This year, we pledge with greater confidence to fight against fascist rule, defend the basic human rights of the Japanese people, and strive for Japan's independence and peace.

    Yoshida Shigeharu, chairman of the Japanese Industrial Trade Union Conference, and Sumiyama Shiro, secretary-general of the Japan Farmers' Association, also made speeches welcoming Stalin's New Year's greetings. Yoshida Shigeharu said: This message is a cry for help to all Japanese people who are in distress and threatened by rearmament and war preparations. The path that the Japanese people must take first must be the path of struggling to liberate themselves from colonial status. Sumiyama Shiro said: As long as a person is upright, he will definitely welcome Stalin's New Year's greetings. We are determined to dedicate ourselves to the struggle for Japan's independence and peace this year.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd dispatch from Tokyo: Negotiations for the US-Japan "Administrative Agreement" are being intensified in Tokyo. The US and Japanese reactionaries, fearing the increasing opposition of the broad masses of the Japanese people, are shamelessly attempting to use ambiguous wording and clauses to cover up the aggressive face of the "Administrative Agreement" in order to deceive the Japanese people. However, even the ambiguous wording and clauses and the news revealed by foreign bourgeois news agencies still nakedly expose that this "Administrative Agreement" is merely a slave treaty that completely destroys Japanese sovereignty and drives Japan to serve as a cannon fodder for US aggression.

    The most prominent example is the provision in the "Administrative Agreement" regarding so-called "emergency situations." According to a Kyodo News Agency report on the 16th, it is "highly likely" that the "Administrative Agreement" will include this "principle provision": "In the event of an emergency (the US and Japan) will consult to take appropriate measures." However, behind this "principle provision" lies the concrete content of turning Japan into a tool of US aggression. According to an AFP Tokyo dispatch, "reliable government sources" revealed that the provision regarding "emergency situations" is actually a so-called "defense agreement," which has already entered the drafting stage. It will stipulate that Japan has the obligation to assist the United States in carrying out aggressive wars and to "make the fullest use of Japan's capabilities." Under this so-called "emergency situation"—including armed suppression of the Japanese people's movement for peace and democracy—the US military stationed in Japan can even take "any action" freely "without being bound by the Administrative Agreement" and can command Japan's armed forces. This fully shows that the US occupation forces remaining in Japan after the separate peace treaty takes effect are by no means for Japan's "security," but to tie Japan to the US war chariot.

    The US and Japanese reactionaries are attempting to use the words "area" and "facility" to conceal the US plot to turn Japan into a military base, but a Kyodo News Agency dispatch on the 18th inadvertently revealed this secret. Kyodo News Agency admitted that the "understanding matters" proposed by the United States regarding the location, facilities, housing, training grounds, etc. of the US military stationed in Japan are: "In order to avoid giving the Japanese side the impression that the United States is using this agreement to demand bases from Japan, the United States does not use the term 'base,' but uniformly uses terms such as 'area' and 'facility.'" In order to construct these military bases disguised as "areas" and "facilities," Japanese farmers' farmland and even private houses will be requisitioned. The specific work related to military bases will be handled by the "US-Japan Joint Committee" manipulated by the United States.

    The US-Japan "Administrative Agreement" negotiations recently reached agreements on matters that undermine Japanese sovereignty are not limited to this. According to Kyodo News Agency, the US and Japan have "generally" agreed that the US military stationed in Japan will enjoy extraterritoriality in criminal cases. According to regulations, the right to try any criminal case committed by US military personnel and military staff in Japan, whether "on duty" or "not on duty," rests with the United States, and Japan shall not interfere.

    The Yoshida government's shameless and thorough selling out of Japanese sovereignty and its actions of assuming cannon fodder obligations have been opposed by the broad masses of the Japanese people and have also aroused dissatisfaction within the Japanese ruling group. On the 18th, several opposition parties held an "Emergency Joint Opposition Party Conference," deciding to demand that the Yoshida government promptly explain the negotiation process of the "Administrative Agreement" to the Diet, and explain it to the Diet again when the agreement is drafted and finalized. The emergency meeting also demanded that the "measures" regarding the so-called "emergency situation" be "clearly recorded" in the preamble of the "Administrative Agreement," "unrestrained by the US-Japan Memorandum of Understanding." The meeting also requested the Yoshida government to explain in advance the specific content of the 65 billion yen "burden-sharing defense costs" in the draft budget. As everyone knows, the so-called "burden-sharing defense costs" are used to fulfill the US-Japan "Security Treaty," including the "Administrative Agreement," that is, to maintain the US occupation forces stationed in Japan.

    日本拥护和平委员会等团体发表声明
    坚决保卫和平答谢斯大林的关怀
    广大人民反对出卖主权的美日“行政协定”
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京迟到消息：日本进步群众团体和工会、农会的领导人物，热烈欢迎斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电。
    日本拥护和平委员会的声明说：苏联领袖对日本的自由和独立表示深厚的希望和信念，这对日本人民是最大的鼓舞。声明着重说：为争取日本人民的自由和生活的稳定，为争取日本的独立，我们再一次号召爱国人士团结起来，坚决保卫和平。为和平解决世界各国的问题，我们强力要求五大国早日缔结和平公约，并圆满解决日本问题。
    全面媾和爱国运动协议会发表的声明说：斯大林给日本人民的新年贺电，是苏联人民由于深深同情日本人民而说出来的坦率的话。我们愿意诚恳而欢欣地接受它。声明指出：处于被长期占领状态中的日本人民，正如斯大林大元帅所指出的，是处于水深火热之中。爱护日本国土和民族的一切日本人，他的第一个愿望就是早日从占领状态——外国军队的统治——下解放出来，恢复民族的完全独立和自由。声明进一步说：像从前“满洲国”那样的独立，是日本人民所不愿意的。外国军队为了侵略亚洲，在日本占有军事基地、变日本为亚洲兵工厂、重新武装日本，对于这一切企图，大多数的日本人都是强烈反对的。声明最后说：为了从占领状态中解放出来，要团结一切力量，起来奋斗。我们为答谢斯大林的新年贺电，宣誓要团结全世界的和平力量，集中全力进行斗争，以保卫日本的独立与和平。
    日本国民救援会也曾在一月九日发表声明说：日本人民以兴奋和感激的心情来接受斯大林的新年贺电。声明又说：在日本，仅在去年一年，由于为争取日本的独立与和平进行斗争而被逮捕投狱的人，就有一千数百人之多。援救这些爱国者和他们的家属的工作，日益成为更多的人的切身的运动了。声明强调说：今年，我们以更高的信心宣誓和法西斯统治作斗争，保卫日本人民的基本人权，为争取日本的独立与和平而奋斗。
    日本产业别工会会议主席吉田资治、日本农民协会事务局长隅山四郎等人，也都发表谈话，欢迎斯大林的新年贺电。吉田资治说：这个贺电对于处在生活困苦和重新武装与备战的威胁下的全体日本人民，是援救的呼声。日本人民应走的道路，首先必须是进行从殖民地状态中解放出来的斗争的道路。隅山四郎说：只要是一个正直的人，他就一定欢迎斯大林的新年贺电。我们有决心在今年为日本的独立与和平进行献身的斗争。
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：美日“行政协定”的谈判正在东京加紧进行中。美、日反动派由于害怕日本广大人民日益加强的反对，无耻地企图用含糊其词的条文字句，来掩盖“行政协定”的侵略面目，以欺骗日本人民。但是即使含糊其词的条文字句和外国资产阶级通讯社透露的消息，仍赤裸裸地暴露了这个“行政协定”只是彻底破坏日本主权并驱使日本充当美国侵略炮灰的奴隶条约。
    最显著的事例是“行政协定”中关于所谓“紧急状态”的规定。据共同社十六日消息：“行政协定”极有可能列入“在紧急状态时（美日双方）协商采取适当措施”这一“原则性规定”。但是，在这个“原则性规定”的背后隐藏着变日本为美国的侵略工具的具体内容。据法新社东京讯，“可靠的政府人士”透露，有关“紧急状态”的规定，实际上是一个所谓“防御协定”，这个“协定”并已进入草拟阶段。它将规定日本有义务协助美国进行侵略战争，并“最充分地利用日本的能力”。在这种所谓“紧急状态”——包括武装镇压日本人民争取和平民主的运动在内——下，驻日美军甚至可以“不受行政协定的约束”，自由采取“任何行动”，并且可以指挥日本的武装力量。这充分说明在单独和约生效后美国占领军留驻日本决不是为了什么日本的“安全”，而是为了把日本缚上美国的战车。
    美日反动派企图以“地域”和“设施”的字样，来掩饰美国把日本变为军事基地的阴谋，但是共同社十八日发出的一则消息却不小心地揭穿了这个秘密。共同社承认，美国所提出的关于在日美军的驻扎地点、设施、房屋、演习场地等的“谅解事项”，其内容是：“美国为避免使日方有美国以这个协定向日本要求基地的印象，不使用‘基地’一词，而统一用‘地域’及‘设施’等词句。”为了建筑这些在“地域”和“设施”的外衣掩盖下的军事基地，将要征用日本农民的耕地以至私人的房屋。有关军事基地的具体工作，由美国操纵的“美日联合委员会”担任。
    美日“行政协定”谈判最近获得协议的破坏日本主权的事项，还不仅如此而已。据共同社透露，美日双方已“大体”同意驻日美军在刑事案件上享有治外法权。根据规定，驻日美国军人及军事工作人员在日本任何地方不论“因公”或“不是因公”所犯的刑事案件，审判权一律在美方，日本不得过问。
    吉田政府这样无耻地彻底出卖日本的主权和担当炮灰义务的卖国行动，遭到了日本广大阶层人民的反对，也引起了日本统治集团内部的不满。十八日，若干在野党派召开“紧急在野党联合协议会”，决定要求吉田政府迅速向国会说明“行政协定”的谈判经过，并在协定成案拟好时再向国会加以说明。紧急会议还要求在“行政协定”序文中“明确记载”关于所谓“紧急状态”的“措施”，“不受日美两国谅解事项的约束”。会议并要求吉田政府提前说明预算草案中六百五十亿日元“分担防卫费”的具体内容。大家知道，所谓“分担防卫费”是用来履行包括“行政协定”在内的美日“安全条约”的，也就是维持驻日美国占领军的。
