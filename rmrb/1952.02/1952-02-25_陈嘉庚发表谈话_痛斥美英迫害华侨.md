Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, February 23rd: On the eve of the struggle against colonial rule, Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief General Association, issued a statement on opposing the increasingly intensified persecution of overseas Chinese by US and British imperialists. Chen Jiageng pointed out: China is now the pillar of defending peace in Asia, so US and British imperialists are particularly hostile to our country and instruct their colonial governments to intensify the persecution of our vast number of overseas compatriots.

Chen Jiageng said: As everyone knows, the development of various places in Nanyang is inseparable from the pioneering achievements of our vast number of overseas Chinese. During the Pacific War, the vast number of overseas Chinese bravely disregarded sacrifice and cooperated with the local people to oppose the aggression and enslavement of Japanese imperialism. The achievements of overseas Chinese in developing various places in Nanyang can never be erased.

Chen Jiageng continued: In recent years, the colonial governments of the imperialists have completely abandoned morality and unreasonably persecuted overseas Chinese even more, leaving the lives and property of overseas Chinese without any guarantee. This is something that the Chinese people cannot tolerate, and it is also opposed by all peace-loving people in the world. The Chinese people who have stood up will definitely vigorously support the just struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese and crush all the evil conspiracies of imperialism to persecute overseas Chinese.

Chen Jiageng finally called on the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese to unite closely, be friendly and help each other with the local people, and step up their struggle to defend the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese, such as freedom of residence, business, and the safety of life and property.

    陈嘉庚发表谈话
    痛斥美英迫害华侨
    【新华社福州二十三日电】南洋华侨筹赈总会主席陈嘉庚在反对殖民制度斗争日前夕，就反对美、英帝国主义者的日益加紧迫害华侨发表谈话。陈嘉庚指出：中国现在是保卫亚洲和平的砥柱，因此美英帝国主义者也就特别敌视我国，并指使其殖民地政府加紧迫害我国在国外的广大侨胞。
    陈嘉庚说：大家知道，南洋各地的开拓，是和我广大华侨披荆斩棘的功绩分不开的。太平洋战争期间，广大华侨更是奋勇地不顾牺牲，配合当地人民，来反对日本帝国主义的侵略和奴役。华侨开辟南洋各地的功绩是永远不能被磨灭的。
    陈嘉庚接着说：近几年来，帝国主义者的殖民政府完全背弃道义，更加无理地迫害华侨，使华侨的生命财产毫无保障。这实在是我国人民所不能容忍的，也是全世界一切爱好和平的人民所反对的。站立起来了的中国人民一定大力支援爱国华侨的正义斗争，粉碎帝国主义迫害华侨的一切罪恶阴谋。
    陈嘉庚最后号召海外广大的爱国华侨亲密团结一致，和当地人民友爱互助，为保卫华侨的居住、营业的自由和生命财产的安全等正当权益而加紧奋斗。
