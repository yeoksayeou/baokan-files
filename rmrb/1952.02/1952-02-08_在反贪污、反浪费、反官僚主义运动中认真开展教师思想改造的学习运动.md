In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, significant progress has been made since its launch in Beijing and Tianjin universities. Due to the thorough mobilization of the masses by the schools, the promotion of democracy, the public exposure of the poison left behind by the bourgeoisie in the schools, and the enthusiastic and sharp conduct of criticism and self-criticism, the masses have been widely mobilized, presenting a new atmosphere in the schools. Because the administrative leaders at all levels of the schools have made self-examinations with the help of the Party and the promotion of the masses, the masses generally believe that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has, for the first time, promoted democracy in universities and brought unprecedented unity to universities. From the materials initially revealed by the schools, it can be seen that the phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in universities not only exist but are also serious. In terms of corruption, there are not only many small tigers but also big tigers in some universities. In terms of waste, the accumulation and loss of state assets in the Mechanical Engineering Department of the Engineering College of Peking University alone amounted to more than 2.6 billion yuan. As for the waste caused by departmentalism, competition for funds, blind construction, and unplanned purchase of equipment, they are too numerous to mention. Bureaucracy is even more widespread. The administrative leaders of general schools are irresponsible in their work, aloof, perform their duties perfunctorily, are seriously divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, and have strong bourgeois ideology. A few of them even fail to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. Therefore, the view that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has "nothing to gain" in universities is unfounded and completely wrong.

Through this movement, the understanding of many administrative leaders of the schools has been raised, many people have seen the shortcomings of their work and some problems existing in their schools, and they have also discovered the power of the masses. At the same time, they have also generated confidence in reforming higher education with revolutionary spirit and revolutionary methods. For example, Tang Yongtong, Vice President of Peking University, said at a meeting: "The reason why Peking University is not well-run is that the ideology that dominates Peking University is not proletarian ideology, but the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie. In the past, I was poisoned by the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie, and I was not selfless, but selfish. After political study, I realized that intellectuals can be transformed, and the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has strengthened my confidence. Due to the development of the power of the masses, I believe that my thinking can be completely transformed, and our school can also be completely reformed." After visiting the "Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Exhibition" of the Normal University, President Lin Liru wiped his tears and said to Vice Provost Ding Haochuan in a sorrowful tone: "We were wrong in the past, wrong, completely wrong, wrong in the piecemeal reforms; what Normal University needs is revolution, revolution, not reform!" He also said in his self-examination at the assembly of all teachers, students, and staff on January 25: He had been searching for a path for two years but found it in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. He took the path of reformism in the past, and in order to transform in the future, he must take the path of revolution. At present, everyone has realized that "the perfunctory and irresponsible attitude of employment; the feudal traditions of patriarchal rule, sectarianism, and conservatism" are the main problems that make the progress of Normal University slow and the reforms few. In this movement, many teachers have also made self-examinations. Some have criticized their "feudal boss" style in academic circles; some have criticized their selfish and self-serving departmentalism; some have exposed their sectarianism; some have examined their guest-like attitude, and so on. Most teachers have realized that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement itself is the most practical, vivid, and effective ideological remolding movement. For example, Professor Li Rongmian of Fu Jen Catholic University called the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement "the human remolding movement"; some professors believe that this movement is more profound for their education than participating in land reform; generally, they all want to take a bath in this movement. It is generally felt that with the foundation of the previous stage of teacher ideological remolding study, continuing ideological remolding study in the actual revolutionary struggle of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement will have a greater effect. Therefore, the Beijing and Tianjin University Teacher Study Committee clearly stated on February 1: To make the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement a stage of the ideological remolding study of teachers in Beijing and Tianjin universities, and continue to carry out ideological remolding study in this movement. This decision is entirely correct.

However, it must still be pointed out that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Beijing and Tianjin universities has not been carried out thoroughly enough. In terms of the examination and exposure of specific issues, the "big tigers" in some schools have not yet been caught; the waste phenomena in some schools have not yet been fully exposed; even on the point of anti-bureaucracy, its breadth and depth are very insufficient. In terms of the teachers' understanding, there are still some people who adopt an attitude of "indifference" and "watching the excitement" towards the movement. Especially among some administrative leaders and major professors, there are still various incorrect views on criticism and self-criticism. They believe that criticism is a "destruction of prestige and reputation" for those being criticized, so they are resistant in their emotions; they use self-criticism as a weapon to block criticism, and they hold the idea of "passing the test" when making public self-examinations. Even when they have to make self-examinations, they are timid, hesitant, and unable to expose and criticize their shortcomings and mistakes thoroughly in front of the masses. This is entirely a vulgar attitude of the bourgeoisie. These people have not realized that in our country, criticism and self-criticism are the manifestations of the whole society's concern and responsibility for everyone and everyone's concern and responsibility for the whole society; if we do not care about carrying out criticism and self-criticism, then talking about truly caring about improving work, transforming our thinking, and reforming higher education is inconceivable. Therefore, the attitude towards this movement and towards criticism and self-criticism can become a clear sign of the level of political awareness of every teacher and every working cadre and whether they are loyal and responsible to the motherland and the people. Based on the above situation, the Beijing and Tianjin University Teacher Study Committee pointed out: In Beijing and Tianjin universities, it is still necessary to continue to promote democracy, further enlighten the consciousness of the masses, expose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy more boldly and bravely, and carry out criticism and self-criticism more widely, more seriously, and more profoundly, and resolutely carry out this movement to the end. This is very important. Because only in this way can everything be inspected and everyone be educated.

Experience has proven that as long as the administrative leaders of the schools have determination and confidence, and are good at concentrating the masses' specific demands and opinions on the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and develop their enthusiasm, a large-scale and healthy anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement can be carried out in depth and universally. Therefore, we hope that the administrative leaders of all schools can have a sufficient understanding of this movement, personally go to the battlefield, and put forward their respective requirements and formulate specific guidelines and methods according to the characteristics of their own schools and the actual development of the movement in their own schools. They should also consciously prevent some deviations, so that they can lead the masses forward along the correct track, maintain the masses' full enthusiasm for the struggle, and not be afraid of everything, be timid, and make the movement stagnate. As for the conduct of the movement, the main thing should be to thoroughly expose the work, because only in this way can we fundamentally understand the nature of the exposed corruption, waste, and bureaucracy phenomena, and guide the masses to carry out sharp struggles against the corrupt ideology of the bourgeoisie, and thoroughly sweep away all the poisons left by the bourgeoisie in our universities.

In this movement, Beijing and Tianjin universities will finally achieve the goal of thoroughly eliminating corruption, waste, and overcoming bureaucracy. Through this movement, the teachers of Beijing and Tianjin universities will all receive due training and further transformation in actual struggle, so as to establish a new morality and new style of honesty and public service and cherishing state public property. The correct and in-depth development of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in universities will pave a smooth road for our higher education reform work. Therefore, those in the education sector who have not started ideological remolding study should start with this movement, and those who have started ideological remolding study should also turn to this movement. Because facts have proven that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement is the most practical, vivid, and effective ideological remolding movement at present.

    在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中认真开展教师思想改造的学习运动
    纪初阳
    反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动在北京、天津各高等学校展开以来，已收到不少成绩。由于各校放手发动了群众，发扬了民主，公开揭露了资产阶级在各校留下来的污毒，热烈地、尖锐地开展了批评和自我批评，群众已广泛地动员起来，而使各校呈现出一片新的气象。因为各校各级行政领导人在党的帮助和群众的推动之下作了检讨，群众普遍认为，反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动使高等学校破天荒第一次发扬了民主，给高等学校带来了史无前例的大团结。从目前各校初步揭发出来的材料来看，在高等学校里的贪污、浪费、官僚主义的现象不仅存在，而且是严重的。就贪污来说，在有些高等学校里不仅有许多中小老虎，而且有大老虎；就浪费来说，仅北京大学工学院机械系一系积压和损耗国家资财就有二十六亿余元。至于由于本位主义、争夺经费、盲目施工和无计划地购买仪器等等所造成的浪费更不胜枚举。就官僚主义来说，是更普遍的。一般学校的行政领导人对工作是不负责任，高高在上，例行公事，严重的脱离群众，脱离实际，且存在着浓厚的资产阶级的思想，其中少数人甚至是敌我不分。所以认为反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动在高等学校里“没有什么搞头”的观点，是毫无根据的，是完全错误的。
    通过这次运动，不少学校的行政领导人的认识提高了，不少人已看到了自己工作的缺点和自己学校里存在着的一些问题，也发现了群众的力量；同时对于用革命的精神和革命的办法来改革高等教育也产生了信心。如北京大学汤用彤副校长在某一次会上说：“北京大学所以办不好，就是因为统治北京大学的思想不是无产阶级思想，而是资产阶级的腐朽思想。我过去受了资产阶级腐朽思想的毒害，不是大公无私，而是无公有私。经过政治学习，我认识了知识分子是可以改造的，反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动更加强了我的信心。由于发挥了群众的力量，我相信我的思想能够得到彻底改造，我们的学校也能够得到彻底改革。”师范大学林砺儒校长在参观了该校“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义展览会”以后，抹了眼泪，并语调沉痛地对副教务长丁浩川说：“过去我们错了，错了，完全错了，错在枝枝节节的改良上；师大需要的是革命，是革命，不是改良！”他在一月二十五日全校师生员工大会上检讨时并说：二年来摸不着的路，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的运动里摸着了。以前走的是改良主义的路今后要想改造，必须走革命的路。目前大家已认识到“因循敷衍、不负责任的雇佣态度；家长统治、宗派主义、保守主义的封建传统”是使师范大学进步慢、改革少的主要症结。在这次运动里，有不少教师也都做了检讨，有的批判了自己在学术界的“封建把头”作风；有的批判了损人利己、明抢暗夺的本位主义思想；有人揭露了自己的宗派主义；有人检讨到自己的客卿态度，等等。大部分教师已认识到反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动本身就是最实际、最生动、最有效的思想改造运动。如辅仁大学李荣冕教授把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动称做“人的改造运动”；也有的教授认为这一运动对自己的教育比参加土地改革更深刻；一般的是都要求在这次运动里洗个澡。普遍地感到：有了前一个阶段教师思想改造学习的基础，继续在反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动的实际革命斗争中来进行思想改造的学习，其效果将更大。所以，北京、天津高等学校教师学习委员会在二月一日明确地提出：把反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动做为北京、天津高等学校教师思想改造学习的一个阶段，继续在这个运动中来进行思想改造的学习。这个决定是完全正确的。
    但仍必须指出，北京、天津各高等学校的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动，进行得还很不彻底。就对具体问题的检查和揭发来说，有些学校的“大老虎”还没有被捉到；有些学校的浪费现象还没有全部被揭露出来；就是在反对官僚主义的这一点上，其宽度和深度也是很不够的。就教师的认识来说，至今还有一部分人对运动采取“漠不关心”和“看看热闹”的态度。特别是在有些行政领导人和主要教授中，对批评和自我批评还存在着种种错误的看法。他们认为批评对于被批评的人来说，是对他们的一种“威信和名誉的破坏”，所以在情绪上是抵抗的；他们把自我批评当做堵塞批评的武器来使用，当众检讨是抱着“过关”思想。就是不得已非检讨不可了，也是畏首畏尾、拖泥带水，不能在群众面前把自己的缺点和错误暴露和批判得干干净净。这完全是资产阶级的庸俗态度。这些人还没有认识到，在我们的国家里，进行批评和自我批评，是全社会对于每一个人和每一个人对于全社会关心负责的表现；如果说，在我们之中不去关心开展批评和自我批评，那么去谈什么真正关心工作的改进、改造自己的思想和改革高等教育都是不可思议的。因此，对待这个运动，对待批评和自我批评的态度，可以成为每一个教师、每一个工作干部的政治觉悟水平和对祖国、对人民忠诚负责与否的鲜明标志。根据以上情况，北京、天津高等学校教师学习委员会指出：在北京、天津高等学校里，仍必须继续发扬民主，进一步启发群众的觉悟，更大胆地、更勇敢地揭发贪污、浪费、官僚主义，更广泛地、更严肃地、更深刻地展开批评和自我批评，坚决把这一运动进行到底。这是十分重要的。因为只有这样，才能使处处都受到检查，人人都受到教育。
    经验已经证明了：只要各校的行政领导人有决心，有信心，并善于集中群众对于反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义斗争的具体要求和意见，发挥其积极性，一个大规模地、健康地反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动就能够深入而普遍地展开。所以我们希望在各校行政领导人员，都能对这一运动有足够认识，亲自上战场，根据自己学校的特点和自己学校运动发展的实际情况，提出各自的要求和制定具体的方针和办法。并应有意识地防止一些偏向，既能带领群众循着正确的轨道前进，保持群众对于斗争的饱满热情；而又不至于怕三怕四，缩手缩脚，使运动停滞不前。至于在运动的进行上，则主要的应该是认真彻底地揭发工作，因为只有这样，才能把那些揭发出来的贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象从本质上加以认识，才能引导群众向资产阶级的腐朽思想进行尖锐斗争，彻底扫清资产阶级在我们的高等学校中所留下的一切污毒。
    在这次运动里，北京、天津高等学校最后将达到彻底肃清贪污、浪费，克服官僚主义的目的。经过这次运动，北京、天津高等学校的教师们都将在实际斗争中得到应有的锻炼和进一步的改造，借以树立起一种廉洁奉公、爱护国家公共财产的新道德和新作风。反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义运动在高等学校里正确地、深入地展开，将给我们高等教育改革工作铺平一条顺利的道路。所以目前在教育界中，未开始思想改造学习者应由这个运动开始，已开始思想改造学习者也应转入这个运动。因为事实证明，反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动是当前最实际、最生动、最有效的思想改造运动。
