In response to criticism and suggestions from People's Daily readers:

    To the Editor:
    In the "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on December 9th of last year, Comrade Zhang Weide's letter criticized the Shijiazhuang Huafeng Production Management Office and the Shijiazhuang Enterprise Company for violating the unified procurement policy and monetary management policies when their personnel went out to make purchases. After our inspection, it has been proven that the facts pointed out by Comrade Zhang are correct. Comrade Zhang's criticism has made us realize that the bureaucratism and carelessness in our work are very serious; we express our sincere gratitude.
    Currently, Shijiazhuang City is vigorously and swiftly launching a movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. Public enterprises have generally entered the inspection phase. There are many more instances of serious policy violations by production units such as the Huafeng Production Management Office and the Enterprise Company, which are being thoroughly investigated. Once the facts are ascertained, they will be strictly dealt with, and a further response will be provided.

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    石家庄市财政经济委员会  
    对违反统一采购政策的单位正作彻底检查
    编辑同志：去年十二月九日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表张维德同志的信，批评石家庄市华丰生产管理处和石家庄市企业公司外出采购人员，有违反统一采购物资政策和货币管理政策的现象。经过我们检查，证明张同志指出的事实都是正确的。张同志的批评，使我们认识到我们工作中的官僚主义和粗枝大叶作风是很严重的；我们表示十分感谢。
    目前石家庄市正在大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地展开反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的运动，各公营企业已普遍进入检查阶段。华丰生产管理处和企业公司等机关生产单位严重违犯政策的事情还有很多，正在彻底检查。查明后当即严格处理，并再作答复。　
    石家庄市人民政府财政经济委员会
