    Guarantee of Peace
    Su'erkefu, Deputy Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union, Stalin Prize Winner
    The entire Soviet people are commemorating the second anniversary of the signing the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China. This treaty has solidified the long-standing friendly relations between our motherland and the working people of People's China. The entire Soviet people understand this treaty with deep satisfaction. The Soviet people recognize this treaty as a clear manifestation of the Soviet government's peace-loving foreign policy, aimed at expanding and consolidating the political, economic, and cultural ties between the two great peoples. They also value this treaty as a strong guarantee for maintaining peace in Asia and the world, and as the most powerful blow to the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers, who are trying to impose a new devastating war on the people of the world, and to invade the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democratic countries.
    Soviet writers have striven to consolidate and expand ties with progressive Chinese writers. During the more than two decades of the Chinese people's heroic struggle against imperialism and its Kuomintang lackeys, Soviet writers, along with the entire Soviet people, have paid unremitting attention to the progress of this struggle. Many of them have dedicated their works to the heroic sons and daughters of the Chinese people, who, under the guidance of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, have risen up to fight for the honor, freedom, and independence of their motherland. We Soviet people have personally experienced all the hardships of fighting against foreign imperialist bandits and their counter-revolutionary agents, so we have always understood and felt close to the struggle waged by the Chinese people. We were filled with joy when we heard the news that the working people of China had achieved the victory of establishing a people's regime in China.
    I personally witnessed in 1927 in Yaroslavl how Mayakovsky, the outstanding and most talented poet of the Soviet era, read a telegram about the People's Army capturing Shanghai at his own evening in the municipal theater, and I also personally witnessed how the working-class audience in Yaroslavl was excited and encouraged after hearing this good news. This story prompted Mayakovsky to write a famous poem, "My Best Poem."
    The works of Lu Xun, the outstanding writer of China and a selfless fighter for a free China, have been widely circulated among a large number of Soviet readers for many years. In the 1930s, the poems of the Chinese Communist Party poet Xiao San were translated into Russian and published in several collections. In recent years, Chinese literary works translated into Russian and other fraternal national languages ​​of the Soviet Union also include works by modern Chinese writers Zhao Shuli, Ding Ling, and others. The number of copies of Chinese writers' books published in the Soviet Union has reached millions. Excellent Chinese poems and prose are frequently published in our magazines. Chinese theatrical works have also begun to be staged in Soviet theaters.
    In recent years, the ties between Chinese and Soviet writers have been greatly strengthened and expanded. Many Soviet writers, including Fadeyev, Simonov, and Ehrenburg, have visited China. We have also repeatedly received distinguished Chinese guests—writers—in Moscow and the fraternal republics. We held evenings with them to exchange creative experiences. These evenings were held in very crowded halls and were always very successful. In our literary life, the anniversary of Lu Xun's death has become a huge cultural event. On this day, not only do newspapers commemorate it in the Soviet Union, but also large-scale literary evenings are held.
    All of this illustrates a gratifying fact: the fraternal relationship between Chinese and Soviet literature is constantly consolidating, and the work of introducing excellent works of literature and writers from our two countries to each other's people is expanding.
    The great peoples of our two countries are walking at the forefront of the great army of peace fighters in the world. The more consolidated the spiritual ties between our two peoples, the more deeply we understand each other, the more beneficial the sacred cause of fighting against the imperialist warmongers will be.
    Art and literature are powerful means of spiritual communication between people of all countries. Therefore, we Soviet writers consider it our duty to do our best to expand the introduction of excellent works of Chinese literature to Soviet readers, especially the works of modern writers who write about contemporary China, about its struggle to build a new society, and about the heroic struggle against imperialist conspiracies. We wish for the works of Chinese writers to be published in the most perfect translations, we wish for our writers to pay more attention to the theme of the Chinese people's struggle for a new life, study the life of new China, and consolidate ties with Chinese writers.
    We are convinced that the contribution of Soviet writers to the cause of friendship of our great people will be as our people, who are filled with the most friendly feelings toward the Chinese people, expect of us.
    Comrade Stalin, the great leader of the working people of the world and the brilliant teacher of communist construction, encourages us to consolidate the fraternal ties with the Chinese people.

### 和平的保证

    和平的保证
    苏联作家协会副总书记斯大林奖金获得者  苏尔科夫
    全苏联人民都纪念苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟与中华人民共和国之间的友好同盟互助条约签订的两周年。这个条约把我们祖国和人民中国的劳动人民之间的多年的友好关系固定了下来。全苏联人民都是怀着深为满意的感情来理解这个条约的。苏联人认定这个条约是苏联政府的爱好和平的对外政策底鲜明表现，其目的在于扩大并巩固两国伟大人民的政治、经济与文化的联系，他们并把这个条约估价为维护亚洲和全世界和平的坚强保证，为对于帝国主义战争贩子们的阴谋的最有力的打击；这些战争贩子竭力想把新的毁灭性的战争强加到全世界各国人民身上，来进犯苏联、中华人民共和国与人民民主国家。
    苏联作家曾尽力巩固和扩大与中国进步作家的联系。在中国人民反对帝国主义及其国民党走狗的英勇斗争的二十多年间，苏联作家和全体苏联人民一起，不懈地注意这一斗争的进行，其中许多人并以自己的作品献给中国人民的英雄儿女——他们在光荣的中国共产党的引导下，奋起为自己祖国的荣誉、自由与独立而斗争。我们苏联人曾亲身尝受过与外国帝国主义强盗及其反革命代理人作斗争的一切艰苦，因此我们对于中国人民所进行的斗争，一向是十分理解并感到亲切的。当我们听到中国的劳动人民取得了在中国建立人民政权的胜利的消息时，我们心中充满了欢快。
    笔者曾经亲眼看到一九二七年在雅罗斯拉夫市，苏维埃时代优秀的最有才华的诗人马雅可夫斯基在市立剧院自己的晚会上宣读了人民军队攻下上海的电报，也亲眼见到雅罗斯拉夫市的工人听众们听到这个喜讯后曾经如何振奋鼓舞。这段故事就使得马雅可夫斯基写成了一首名诗“我的最好的诗”。
    中国的优秀作家和争取自由中国的忘我战士鲁迅的作品，许多年来就在广大的苏联读者群中广泛流传了。在三十年代，中国共产党员诗人萧三的诗作，曾被译成俄文出版了好几册诗集。近几年来，中国文学作品译成俄文及苏联其他兄弟民族语文出版的，还有现代中国作家赵树理、丁玲及其他作家的作品。中国作家的书在苏联出版，其印数已经以百万册计。在我们的杂志上，经常刊登中国诗歌和散文的佳作。中国戏剧作品也已经开始在苏联剧院的舞台上演出了。
    近几年来，中苏两国作家的联系大大地加强并扩大了。有不少苏联作家，其中包括法捷耶夫、西蒙诺夫、爱伦堡，曾到过中国。而我们在莫斯科和兄弟共和国里也屡次接待中国的贵客——作家们，我们同他们一起举行了交换创作经验的晚会，这些晚会在非常拥挤的大厅中举行，而总是非常成功。在我们的文学生活中，鲁迅逝世纪念日已成为巨大的文化事件，这个日子在苏联不仅是报刊要纪念，而且还举行大型的文学晚会。
    所有这一切都说明一件令人愉快的事实：中苏文学间的兄弟关系在不断巩固，我们两国人民相互介绍两国文学作家优秀作品的工作在扩大。
    我们两国伟大的人民正走在全世界和平战士的大军的前列。我们两国人民间的精神联系越巩固，我们相互认识得越深刻，则与帝国主义战争贩子作斗争的神圣事业由此就能更为有利。
    艺术文学是各国人民间精神交往的有力手段。因此，我们苏联作家就以尽力扩大向苏联读者介绍中国文学优秀作品，尤其是写今日中国的、写它的建设新社会的斗争的、写与帝国主义阴谋英勇斗争的现代作家的作品为己任。我们愿中国作家的作品以最完美的译文出版，愿我们的作家更多地注意中国人民为新生活而斗争的主题，研究新中国的生活，并巩固与中国作家的联系。
    我们深信，苏联作家对于我们伟大人民的友好事业的贡献，将会如我们的人民，对中国人民充满了最友好的情感的人民，向我们所盼待的那样。
    全世界劳动人民的伟大领袖，共产主义建设的天才导师斯大林同志鼓舞着我们巩固与中国人民的兄弟联系。
