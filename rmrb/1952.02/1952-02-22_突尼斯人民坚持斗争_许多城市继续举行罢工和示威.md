Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, February 21st: The Tunisian people continue to persist in their struggle for national independence, opposing the French colonial authorities' conspiracy to suffocate the Tunisian national movement with bloody suppression.

Since the general strike and large-scale demonstrations held by the Tunisian people in mid-January to fight for independence, the French colonialists have continued to transfer large numbers of military police from mainland France and Algeria to Tunisia. As of February 11, more than 28,000 soldiers and special armed police had been transferred to Tunisia. Supported by jet planes and tanks, they attacked the Tunisian people, arbitrarily demolishing and burning Tunisian people's houses, and even barbarously trampling children under their feet. They also searched and arrested thousands of peaceful Tunisian people, and then exiled them to the desolate South.

However, the indomitable Tunisian people responded to the French colonialists' frantic persecution with tenacious struggle. The general strike that began on February 1 in many cities persisted until February 9. Stores in the Tunisian capital, Tunis, as well as Sfax, Gabès, and other towns remained closed. Despite the heavy guard lines laid by large numbers of fully armed military police in the streets, patriots in Tunis rushed to the Governor's Palace on the 15th to hold a demonstration. On the 17th, they held another large-scale demonstration. On the same day, a 24-hour strike broke out in the Gafsa mining area.

The struggle of the Tunisian people continues to receive the support of the French working people. Dockworkers in Toulon refused to load war materials onto ships bound for Tunisia, and the working people of Toulouse also held mass rallies to support the Tunisian people.

    突尼斯人民坚持斗争
    许多城市继续举行罢工和示威
    【新华社二十一日讯】突尼斯消息：突尼斯人民继续坚持争取民族独立的斗争，反对法国殖民当局妄图以血腥镇压来窒息突尼斯民族运动的阴谋。
    自从一月中旬突尼斯人民为争取独立而举行总罢工和大示威以来，法国殖民者就继续不断地从法国本土和阿尔及利亚等地把大批军警调到突尼斯去。到十一日为止，调到突尼斯的军队和特别武装警察已达二万八千人以上。他们在喷气飞机和坦克支持下向突尼斯人民进攻，随意拆毁和焚烧突尼斯人民的房屋，甚至野蛮地把小孩子放在脚下践踏。他们还搜捕了整千突尼斯和平人民，然后把他们放逐到荒凉的南方。
    但是，不屈不挠的突尼斯人民用顽强的斗争来回答法国殖民者的疯狂迫害。许多城市中自二月一日开始的总罢工一直坚持到九日还在举行。突尼斯首都突尼斯市以及斯法克斯、加培斯和其他市镇的商店仍然紧闭店门。尽管大批全副武装的军警在街头如临大敌地布下了重重警戒线，突尼斯市的爱国者在十五日还是冲到总督府前举行了示威。十七日，他们又再次举行大示威。同日，在加弗沙矿区也爆发了二十四小时的罢工。
    突尼斯人民的斗争继续得到法国劳动人民的支援。土伦的码头工人拒绝为开往突尼斯的船只搬运战争物资，土鲁斯的劳动人民为声援突尼斯人民，也举行了群众大会。
