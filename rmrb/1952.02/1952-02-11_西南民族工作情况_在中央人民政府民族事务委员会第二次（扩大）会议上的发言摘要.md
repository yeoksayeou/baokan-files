Southwest China Ethnic Work Situation
—Excerpts from a Speech at the Second (Enlarged) Meeting of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government
Wang Weizhou, Chairman of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee

I. The Ethnic Situation in Southwest China

Southwest China is a multi-ethnic region, mainly including Tibetan, Yi, Miao, Hui, Dai, Zhongjia, Minjia, Naxi, and Kawa ethnic groups. According to the current names used by each ethnic group, the total number exceeds one hundred. The total population of all ethnic minorities is approximately 20 million, accounting for about 20% of the total population of the region. The distribution area accounts for more than half of the total area of the region. The 5,000-kilometer national defense line in this region is inhabited by ethnic minorities. These areas are adjacent to countries such as India, Burma, Siam, and Vietnam.

The political, economic, and cultural development of various ethnic minorities is extremely uneven. Some are still stagnating in the socio-economic life of slavery. Armed conflicts often occur between various tribes and branches. There are serious historical divisions and antagonisms between ethnic groups, and disputes and armed conflicts also frequently occur.

The backward socio-economic conditions and complex ethnic relations of the various ethnic minorities were caused by the reactionary ruling groups of past dynasties, especially the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the past two decades and the oppression of imperialist forces of aggression. Imperialism carried out long-term aggressive activities against all ethnic groups in politics, economy, culture, and even military affairs. They provoked ethnic relations, dumped foreign goods, and bought mercenaries, especially through missionary work, establishing schools, and running hospitals, using petty favors to carry out espionage activities to achieve their goal of enslaving all ethnic groups. Their crimes were so serious that they privately set up courts to handle civil and criminal cases. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, in order to promote its great Han chauvinist policy of oppression, carried out large-scale suppression and slaughter of ethnic minorities on the one hand, and developed special agent organizations in ethnic areas on the other, provoking discord and creating trouble. They were subservient to and betrayed the people to imperialism. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups have long been in a painful situation of oppression, deception, and poverty, where they cannot get enough food, clothing, or even salt.

II. Basic Situation of Ethnic Work in Southwest China in the Past Two Years

In the past two years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and under the specific guidance of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central Government, ethnic work in the Southwest region has made certain achievements. In particular, the peaceful liberation of Tibet shattered the imperialist conspiracy of aggression and laid the foundation for consolidating the western frontier defense, thereby creating an unprecedented unity on the entire Chinese mainland. This is a victory for Chairman Mao's great ethnic policy, and the people of all ethnic groups in the Southwest and throughout the country feel very happy and excited.

In the past two years, ethnic work in the Southwest region can be roughly divided into two stages: the first stage was from the beginning of liberation until the Central Delegation went to Xikang to help establish the Tibetan Autonomous Region; the second stage was from the experience of establishing the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Xikang to conduct pilot work on establishing political power throughout the region until now.

Since the Southwest region was liberated relatively late, most of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants fled into the ethnic minority areas of the Southwest. The number of bandits and special agents once reached one million. The names of bandits and special agents numbered in the hundreds. They attempted to rely on ethnic areas, taking advantage of the vast area, inconvenient transportation, and ethnic divisions, to conspire to establish a so-called "land Taiwan" for long-term resistance. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang also deployed "contingency plans" in various ethnic areas, instigating bandits and special agents to carry out long-term lurking activities, spread rumors, provoke relations between the People's Liberation Army and various ethnic groups, and organize riots in various places.

Therefore, when our People's Liberation Army and local cadres began to enter ethnic areas, they encountered many difficulties. Under these circumstances, the provinces and districts resolutely implemented the policy of "prudence and steady progress." First, they vigorously communicated the feelings between ethnic groups and launched extensive publicity on ethnic policies. The People's Liberation Army implemented exemplary mass discipline in ethnic areas, carried forward the traditional spirit of hard work, and greatly eliminated ethnic divisions and strengthened ethnic relations through practical actions such as helping with labor production and providing disaster relief. At the same time, they resolutely strived to unite leading figures from all aspects of the various ethnic groups who had contact with the masses, treated them warmly, consulted with them first in case of trouble, and absorbed a large number of leading figures and young people from ethnic minorities to participate in the leadership and work of local political power. Through various large and small meetings and nearly a hundred ethnic visits, ethnic unity was further strengthened, and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents were isolated. With the demands and support of the people of all ethnic groups, the People's Liberation Army and local public security forces launched a large-scale struggle to suppress bandits and eliminate special agents, achieving great victories. Armed bandits and special agents have basically been eliminated. In addition, more than 5,000 ethnic disputes have been mediated, and the long-standing ethnic feuds and vendettas in ethnic areas have also basically stopped. A new atmosphere of stability and unity, unprecedented in history, has emerged in ethnic areas. This can also be said to be the first stage of ethnic work in the Southwest.

Since July 1950, when the Central Delegation arrived in the Southwest and assisted in the establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Xikang and the ethnic democratic united governments in various places, ethnic work in the Southwest has taken another step forward on the basis of ethnic unity. In January last year, the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee convened an enlarged meeting and decided to carry out ethnic democratic political construction throughout the region. People's governments at all levels in the ethnic areas of Southwest China have successively convened people's representative conferences or ethnic representative conferences of all ethnic groups and all circles. They have also actively implemented ethnic regional autonomy in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, and established ethnic democratic united governments in areas where ethnic minorities live in mixed communities. Up to now, in addition to the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Xikang, 21 county-level autonomous regions, 15 district-level autonomous regions, and 49 township-level autonomous regions have been established. At the same time, ethnic democratic united governments have been established in 11 special districts, 53 counties, 27 districts, and 72 townships. This work is still ongoing.

During the process of ethnic democratic political construction in the Southwest, we waged a resolute and victorious struggle against the sabotage activities of Chiang Kai-shek's special agents, the running dogs of imperialism. Chiang Kai-shek's special agents used the banner of ethnic minorities, and under the instigation of imperialism, incited some bad elements and ambitious elements among ethnic minorities to create ethnic divisions and confusion with reactionary slogans such as "ethnic autonomy" and "ethnic independence." Even when Yunnan had just been liberated, they incited the organization of a "Nanzhao Federation" in an attempt to achieve their vicious conspiracy to undermine the cause of liberation of all ethnic groups. Because we widely united the people of all ethnic groups and leading figures who had contact with the masses, and resolutely and timely carried out ethnic democratic political construction, we shattered all the enemy's sabotage conspiracies.

We also encountered many difficulties in our internal work. First of all, some cadres in various places lacked sufficient understanding of the important significance of ethnic democratic political construction, believing that it was "unnecessary" and "troublesome," worrying about "ethnic divisions" and "ethnic independence," and therefore emphasizing insufficient conditions and passively delaying. We have carried out persuasive work on this. After ethnic democratic political construction in ethnic areas, various tasks have seen significant development. These facts have more effectively enabled our cadres to gradually realize that ethnic democratic political construction is indeed a basic policy for solving ethnic issues. Secondly, a series of new problems have also been encountered among various ethnic groups. Due to vendettas, the various tribes and branches within the ethnic groups have long been in a state of disunity, which has made it very difficult and tortuous to deal with the ethnic composition within the autonomous region, the unity and unification within the ethnic groups, as well as issues related to regional boundaries, administrative status, democratic systems, and personnel distribution. However, because we have grasped the ethnic policy and based ourselves on the actual situation of the ethnic groups, through repeated consultations with leading figures who have contact with the masses and people of all ethnic groups, these problems have been gradually resolved. The political status of women and young people has also been appropriately improved. Therefore, after the establishment of the people's governments of the autonomous regions and the ethnic democratic united governments, the people of all ethnic groups have shown unparalleled joy. They said with emotion: "It's really true!" "We've waited for dozens of generations, and today has finally arrived." "From now on, our ethnic minorities have a 'home.'" After the Miao people in Guizhou elected their own county head, they excitedly said: "In the reactionary period, it was 'Corn cannot be paid as grain, and Miao people cannot be kings.' Now corn can be paid as grain, and our Miao people can also be kings (meaning to be county heads)."

Through ethnic democratic political construction, the people of all ethnic groups have more actively demanded to strengthen ethnic unity and more actively demanded the help of outside cadres. They have become more protective of the Han cadres who work hard in ethnic areas. Many people even have such concerns: "Does the establishment of regional autonomy mean that we will handle everything ourselves and the higher authorities will not care?"

"If outside cadres really don't help, we won't implement regional autonomy."

Through ethnic democratic political construction, the people of all ethnic groups are very concerned about the affairs of the government, large and small, and regard them as their own business. Some people originally thought that participating in government work was working for the Han people; this idea has now changed. The people's political consciousness and work enthusiasm have generally been greatly improved. This can be seen from the following facts. First of all, the people of all ethnic groups have expressed their infinite love and support for the great motherland and the people's leader Chairman Mao, and have launched fierce struggles against imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek remnants. The people of all ethnic groups in Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang and other places have successively organized militia joint defense, set off bandit suppression competitions everywhere, and men, women, old and young, automatically searched the mountains to capture bandits, resulting in many model deeds and heroic figures.

Luo Zhenghong and others of the Yi ethnic group in Xichang Special District captured 37 bandit company and platoon leaders in Lizhou, Ganshang and other places, and seized 2 radio telephones and more than 170 guns. Li Shama of the Yi ethnic group personally killed Zhuge Shaowu, the "Commander of the Eleventh Column of the Southwest Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," at the foot of Longtou Mountain. The Miao people in Guizhou automatically organized guerrillas to cooperate with the bandit suppression troops. Zhang Zeliang of the Miao ethnic group in Puding County led more than 100 people to fight against bandits and special agents. They were surrounded for many days. Although they were cut off from contact with the troops, they still insisted on fighting alone.

Yang, an old man of the Benglong ethnic group in Gengma District, Yunnan, killed 12 bandits and special agents in the bandit suppression struggle. Li Guangbao of the Lahu ethnic group in Lancang County led the people to fight against Chiang Kai-shek's special agents who had sneaked in from outside the border without any external assistance. After eight days of hard fighting, they finally defeated the enemy, who was ten times their number. Four Lahu youth militiamen, empty-handed, used wood to beat five bandits to death and seized five carbine guns. Kawa ethnic group member Yan Long was an ethnic representative who participated in the National Day ceremony in 1950. After returning, he actively promoted the event. Recently, in the battle against Chiang Kai-shek's special agents who had sneaked in, although he was trapped in a heavy encirclement, he remained steadfast and unyielding. Finally, he took off the dress that Chairman Mao gave him and shouted "Defend the Motherland" and "Defend our Chairman Mao" slogans and heroically committed suicide. Such heroic deeds of ethnic minorities in defending the borders of the motherland are everywhere. They dealt a fatal blow to the sabotage activities of the US-Chiang Kai-shek bandits, thereby consolidating the revolutionary order in the border areas and the national defense of the motherland.

After the launch of the Resist US, Aid Korea movement, all ethnic groups responded enthusiastically, successively formulated patriotic covenants, and actively joined the army, increased production, and made donations. Many young people cried because they could not join the army. The Tibetan Autonomous Region in Xikang and the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region have established their own ethnic armed forces - the Tibetan Militia and the Yi Militia. In the movement for people of all ethnic groups to formulate patriotic covenants, the lamas of the Kangding Lama Temple also formulated patriotic covenants and held demonstrations. Young lamas used the income from firewood to donate money to purchase airplanes and cannons. In supporting the troops entering Tibet, many women participated in transportation work. In addition, some ethnic minority areas have launched a three-self reform movement, expelling imperialist elements who were engaged in espionage activities under the guise of missionaries. Facts have proved that the high patriotic enthusiasm of all ethnic groups in resisting the US and aiding Korea is inseparable from the work of ethnic democratic political construction. Ethnic regional autonomy and ethnic democratic united governments are not only the best organizational form for strengthening ethnic unity, but also a powerful weapon for people of all ethnic groups to jointly consolidate national defense and fight against imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek remnants.

The work of ethnic democratic political construction has also created extremely favorable conditions for the development of economic, trade, health, and cultural and educational undertakings of the people of all ethnic groups. State-owned trading companies have set up more than 180 trade branches and sub-companies in various ethnic areas, and have organized more than 300 mobile trade production groups. In Xikang alone, the purchase of local products from the Tibetan and Yi ethnic areas is worth more than 14 billion yuan. It is estimated that the amount of tea transported to Xikang this year will exceed 500,000 packages, which is about three times the annual import before liberation. The prices of local products have generally increased by one to four times, and some have even exceeded ten times; while the tax rate has generally been appropriately reduced. In addition, people's governments in various places have issued large amounts of relief grain and loans for agriculture, animal husbandry, and sideline industries. At the same time, they have built water conservancy and transportation facilities to solve the difficulties in production, greatly improving the production enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups. The local specialties of Xikang Province, such as wool and medicinal materials, have increased by 100% to 200% compared with before liberation; while the rhubarb among the medicinal materials has increased by 500%. The lives of the masses have been considerably improved as a result. Many patriotic deeds, such as the people of various ethnic minorities demanding to pay more taxes and turn in more public grain, have emerged in various places.

In addition, various regions have restored and established more than 160 hospitals and health clinics, and organized 29 mobile medical teams to treat diseases for the masses at reduced fees or even free of charge. With the support of the Central People's Government, the Tibetan Autonomous Region in Xikang quickly extinguished the rinderpest that had spread to an area of 2,000 li, and treated, inspected, and prevented more than 20,000 cattle and horses. The entire region has established 7 ethnic middle schools, 1 ethnic normal school, and nearly 700 ethnic primary schools. There are now more than 135,000 students from ethnic minorities studying in universities, middle schools, and primary schools.

In order to publicize ethnic policies, the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee has successively published the Southwest Ethnic Pictorial (published five issues) and "Southwest Ethnic Communications" (published four issues) in both Tibetan and Chinese, and translated and printed various documents in Tibetan and Miao. In order to publicize the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, a special Tibetan broadcast is held once a week. In addition, film and slide projection teams were sent to ethnic areas for screening, which had good results.

The people of all ethnic groups have expressed their warm support and actively participated in these works carried out by the people's government. From practical experience, the people of all ethnic groups have gradually believed in their own strength, and have also understood the decisive role of the assistance of the Han people in the cause of liberation and construction of their own ethnic groups.

Finally, with the advancement of ethnic democratic political construction, a large number of cadres from various ethnic groups have also emerged. According to preliminary statistics, more than 8,000 ethnic minority cadres have participated in the work of people's governments above the district level, and no less than 10,000 young people of all ethnic groups have participated in political studies. This year, three ethnic colleges, two ethnic schools, and various ethnic cadre training classes have been established in the Southwest region, training more than 3,000 cadres. These cadres and students, because they have close ties with the people of all ethnic groups and have been improved and trained in learning and practical work, have become an important force in promoting the development of ethnic work in the Southwest in the future. Experience has proved that ethnic democratic political construction certainly requires the training of some cadres, but with the development of political construction, a large number of cadres will naturally emerge in practical work.

In the ethnic minority mixed areas of Guizhou and Yunnan, the people of all ethnic groups have put forward the demand for land reform. In these areas, under the general policy of ethnic unity, in accordance with the will of the majority of the masses of their own ethnic group, and with the consent of leading figures who have contact with the masses, relying on their own ethnic cadres, they have carried out the land reform movement in a planned, step-by-step manner with leadership and planning and negotiation mediation methods. In the areas of Guizhou Province with a population of 4 million ethnic minorities, land reform has been implemented in areas with a population of 2 million. The scale of the rent reduction and deposit refund movement in Yunnan, Xichang and other places is also very large. In the struggle and distribution of fruits, the spirit of solidarity and mutual assistance between ethnic groups, especially the Han people, and various ethnic minorities has been greatly promoted, and the momentum of peasants of all ethnic groups has been strengthened. Therefore, the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of tenants, poor peasants, and middle peasants of all ethnic groups have been unprecedentedly improved. From the struggle of land reform, the people of all ethnic groups have deeply realized that this kind of appropriate reform within the ethnic group has an extremely important role in the future development of their own ethnic group. This is a process that must be experienced for the development and progress of ethnic minorities and gradually reaching the level of advanced ethnic groups.

In short, the experience of the Southwest in the past two years has proved that the center of ethnic work at present is ethnic democratic political construction.

III. Some Suggestions on Ethnic Work in the Southwest Region in the Future

Although the ethnic work in the Southwest region has achieved the above-mentioned achievements, this is only the beginning of the work. Because a large part of the area has not yet realized ethnic democratic political construction, and has not met the urgent political demands of the people of all ethnic groups; various tasks have long been in the exploratory stage, and there is a lot of blindness; some cadres still have insufficient understanding of the important significance of ethnic democratic political construction, and there is a phenomenon of underestimation, neglect, and passive delay. Even after the establishment of political power, there are still some hasty, formalistic, and not good at uniting and cooperating with leading figures in various ethnic groups who have contact with the masses; in addition, the leading cadres lack experience, and the timely ideological leadership and experience guidance to various places is very insufficient, causing the work to take many detours. In the future, we must vigorously correct and overcome these shortcomings with a serious and serious attitude.

In the future, the ethnic work in the Southwest region will continue to follow the Central Government's policy of "prudence and steady progress," and based on the various correct instructions of this conference on ethnic democratic political construction, and in combination with the actual situation in the Southwest region, do the following work:

1.  Continue to vigorously promote ethnic democratic political construction. Areas where ethnic autonomous regions and ethnic democratic united governments have been established should be seriously consolidated and enriched so that they can play a greater role. Areas where ethnic autonomous regions and ethnic democratic united governments have not been established should be actively promoted, especially the ethnic regional autonomy policy, which needs to be vigorously implemented.

2.  Based on the actual situation, earnestly help the various ethnic autonomous regions develop production, trade, health, cultural and educational undertakings. At present, it is planned to further develop trade work, and focus on developing water conservancy and establishing farms, etc., and gradually promote advanced production experience to ethnic areas.

3.  Actively train ethnic cadres and strengthen the leadership of the existing ethnic colleges, ethnic schools, and various training classes. At present, a large number of ethnic cadres should still be trained. It is planned to open various forms of short-term or temporary training classes with varying numbers of people to train a large number of male and female youth cadres to meet the urgent needs of ethnic work. In ethnic colleges, it is necessary to plan to train translators, teachers, and other talents.

At the same time, in schools in Han areas, attention should be paid to enrolling ethnic minority young men and women into schools, and they should be given as much care as possible. According to the needs of the work, appropriate Han cadres should also be trained and selected to participate in ethnic work.

4.  Continue to strengthen ethnic unity work and strengthen the publicity of ethnic policies. Continue to publish and translate ethnic pictorials and various documents, and fully use effective publicity tools such as slides, movies, and radio broadcasts. Organize ethnic visits to strengthen ethnic ties and mutual learning.

5.  Continue to strengthen the Resist US, Aid Korea movement, strengthen the education that combines patriotism and internationalism, and overcome the tendency of great Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism. This is a very important part of our work.

Of course, there are many difficulties in doing the above work. However, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, and under the specific guidance of the Ethnic Affairs Commission of the Central Government, relying on the solid and unified unity of the brotherly ethnic groups in the Southwest, we believe that our work will achieve new achievements and new victories.

Long live the unity of all ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China!
Long live Chairman Mao, the leader of the people of all ethnic groups in China!

    西南民族工作情况
    ——在中央人民政府民族事务委员会第二次（扩大）会议上的发言摘要
    西南军政委员会民族事务委员会主任委员  王维舟
    一、西南区的民族情况
    西南是一个多民族的地区，主要有藏、彝、苗、回、傣、仲家、民家、纳喜、佧佤等民族。按照目前各族自己的名称，总数已超过一百多种。各少数民族人口共约有二千万，占全区总人口百分之二十左右。分布区域则占全区面积的大半。本区五千公里的国防线上，都是少数民族聚居区。这些地区邻接印度、缅甸、暹逻、越南等国。
    各少数民族的政治、经济和文化发展极不平衡。有的还停滞在奴隶制的社会经济生活。在各部落各支头之间，经常发生武装械斗。民族之间都有严重的历史隔阂和对立状态，也经常发生纠纷和武装冲突。
    各少数民族这种落后的社会经济和复杂的民族关系，是历代反动统治集团，尤其是近二十多年来蒋匪帮的统治和帝国主义侵略势力的压迫所造成的。帝国主义对各民族在政治、经济、文化乃至军事各方面都进行过长期的侵略活动。他们挑拨民族关系，倾销洋货，收买雇佣军，特别是通过传教、设学校、办医院，以小恩小惠的方式进行特务活动，以达其奴役各民族的目的。其罪行严重到私设法庭，处理民刑案件。而蒋匪帮为推行其大民族主义的压迫政策，对少数民族一面进行大规模的镇压屠杀，另一方面则在民族地区发展特务组织，挑拨离间，制造是非。对帝国主义则又屈膝顺从出卖人民。因此，各民族人民长期处在受压迫、受蒙蔽，贫困到食不饱、穿不暖甚至连盐都吃不到的痛苦境地。
    二、两年来西南民族工作的基本情况
    两年来，西南区民族工作在毛主席和中央人民政府领导之下，在中央民族事务委员会具体指导之下，有了一定成绩。特别是西藏获得和平解放，粉碎了帝国主义侵略阴谋，打下了巩固西陲国防的基础，从而使整个中国大陆出现了历史上从未有过的统一。这是毛主席伟大民族政策的胜利，西南和全国各民族人民无不感到非常欢欣和兴奋。
    两年来，西南民族工作大体可分为两个阶段：第一阶段是从解放开始直到中央访问团到西康帮助建立藏族自治区为止；第二阶段则是从根据建立西康藏族自治区的经验在全区范围内试行建政工作直到现在。
    由于西南区解放较迟，蒋匪残余大部窜入西南民族地区，土匪、特务数目曾一度达到一百万人；土匪、特务名称有数百种。他们企图以民族地区为依托，利用地区辽阔，交通不便，民族隔阂等条件，阴谋建立所谓“陆上台湾”，进行长期顽抗。蒋匪帮并在各民族地区布置“应变计划”，唆使土匪、特务进行长期潜伏活动，散布谣言，挑拨人民解放军和各民族的关系，在各地组织暴乱。
    因此，在我们人民解放军和地方干部开始进入民族地区时，曾遇到很多的困难。在这种情况下面，各省、区坚决执行了“慎重稳进”的方针。首先大力沟通民族间的感情，展开广泛的民族政策的宣传。人民解放军在民族地区执行了模范的群众纪律，发扬了传统的艰苦作风，以帮助劳动生产，救济灾荒等实际行动，大大消除了民族隔阂，密切了民族关系。同时，坚决争取团结了各民族中各方面和群众有联系的领袖人物，对之热诚相待，遇事首先和他们协商，大量吸收少数民族中的领袖人物和青年参加当地政权的领导和工作。通过各种大小会议和近百次民族的参观访问，更加加强了民族团结，孤立了蒋匪特务。在各族人民要求和支援下，人民解放军和各地公安部队展开了大规模的清剿土匪、肃清特务的斗争，获得了很大的胜利    。武装的土匪、特务，基本上已经被肃清了。加以调解了五千多件民族纠纷，使民族区长期存在的民族仇杀和打冤家也基本上停止了。民族区出现了历史上从未有过的安定、团结的新气象。这也可以说是西南民族工作的第一阶段。
    从一九五零年七月，中央访问团到达西南，并协助建立了西康藏族自治区和各地民族民主联合政府之后，西南民族工作又在民族团结的基础上前进了一步。去年一月，西南民族事务委员会召开了扩大会议，决定在全区范围内开展民族民主建政工作。西南民族区各级人民政府都先后召开了各族各界人民代表会议或民族代表会议。并积极地在民族聚居区实行民族区域自治，在民族杂居区建立民族民主联合政府。到现在，已建立起来的民族自治区除西康藏族自治区外，还有二十一个县级自治区，十五个区级自治区，四十九个乡级自治区。同时在十一个专区、五十三个县、二十七个区和七十二个乡建立了民族民主联合政府。这项工作，现在仍在继续进行。
    在西南民族民主建政过程中，我们曾对帝国主义的走狗蒋匪特务的破坏活动进行了坚决胜利的斗争。蒋匪特务打起少数民族的招牌，在帝国主义唆使下，煽惑少数民族中一部分坏分子和野心分子，以“民族自治”、“民族独立”等反动口号制造民族分裂和混乱。甚至在云南刚解放时，煽动组织“南诏联邦”，企图达到其破坏各族人民解放事业的恶毒阴谋。由于我们广泛地团结了各族人民和与群众有联系的领袖人物，坚决而适时地进行了民族民主建政工作，从而粉碎了敌人的一切破坏阴谋。
    在我们的内部工作中也曾遇到许多困难。首先是各地有些干部对民族民主建政的重要意义认识不足，认为“无此必要”，“徒添麻烦”，顾虑“民族分裂”，“闹民族独立”，因而强调条件不够，消极拖延。我们对此曾进行了说服工作。在民族地区经过民族民主建政后，各种工作有了显著的发展。这些事实，更有效地使我们的干部逐步认识了民族民主建政确是解决民族问题的基本政策。其次，在各民族中也遇到一系列的新问题。民族内部各部落、各支头之间由于打冤家，长期处于不团结的状态，这就使得在处理自治区内民族组成关系，民族内部的团结和统一，以及有关区域界线，行政地位，民主制度，人事分配等问题方面，发生很大的困难和曲折。但是，由于我们掌握了民族政策和依据民族的实际情况，通过与群众有联系的领袖人物和各族人民的反复协商，这些问题已逐步得到解决。妇女和青年的政治地位也获得适当的提高。因此在自治区人民政府和民族民主联合政府建立后，各族人民都表现了无比的欢欣。他们感动地说：“天下真有这样的事呀！”“等了几十代，可有了今天。”“从此我们少数民族有‘家’了。”贵州苗族在选出自己的县长以后，兴奋地说：“以前反动时期是‘包谷不上粮，苗家不当王。’如今包谷能上粮，我们苗家也能当王（按：意指当县长）了。”
    经过民族民主建政工作，各族人民更积极地要求加强民族团结，更积极地要求外来干部的帮助，他们对在民族区艰苦工作的汉族干部，更加爱护了。许多人甚至发生了这样的顾虑：“成立区域自治是不是把事情都交给我们自己办，上级不管了呢？”
    “如果外来干部真不帮助，我们就不实行区域自治了。”
    经过民族民主建政工作，各族人民对于政府的大小事情，非常关心，看成是自己的事。某些人原来认为参加政府工作是给汉人作事；这种思想现在也改变了。人民的政治觉悟和工作积极性一般都大大地提高了。这可以从下面的事实看出来。    首先是各族人民对于伟大祖国和人民领袖毛主席表现了无限热爱和拥护，对帝国主义和蒋匪残余展开了激烈的斗争。云南、贵州、西康等地各民族人民纷纷组织民兵联防，到处掀起剿匪竞赛，男女老少自动搜山捉匪，出现了不少模范事迹和英雄人物。
    西昌专区彝族罗正洪等在礼州、甘相等地捉回土匪连、排长三十七人，缴获报话机二部、枪一百七十多支。彝族的李沙马在龙头山脚亲手击毙“西南反共救国军十一纵队司令”诸葛绍武。贵州苗族自动组织了游击队配合剿匪部队作战。普定县苗族张泽良领导百余人和土匪、特务作战，被包围好多天，虽和部队断绝联系，仍单独坚持战斗。
    云南耿马区本人族杨姓老人在剿匪斗争中，一个人打死了十二个土匪、特务。澜沧县倮?族李光保领导人民在毫无外援的情况下，和从国界外窜入的蒋匪特务进行斗争，苦战八日，终于击败了十倍于己的敌人。有四名倮?族青年民兵，赤手空拳，用木材打死五名土匪，缴获五支卡宾枪。佧佤族岩竜是一九五○年参加国庆大典的民族代表，回去后积极宣传，最近在和窜入的蒋匪特务作战中，虽陷重围，仍坚贞不屈，最后脱下毛主席送给他的礼服，高呼“保卫祖国”、“保卫我们毛主席”口号，英勇自杀。少数民族这种保卫祖国边疆的英勇事迹到处都有。他们给美蒋匪特的破坏活动以致命的打击，从而巩固了边疆的革命秩序和祖国国防。
    在抗美援朝运动开展以后，各民族热烈响应，纷纷订立爱国公约，踊跃参军，增产捐献。许多青年因不得参军而痛哭流涕。西康藏族自治区和凉山彝族自治区都建立了本民族人民的武装——藏民团和彝民团。在各族人民订立爱国公约运动中，康定的喇嘛寺的喇嘛也订立爱国公约，游行示威。青年喇嘛以打柴所得的收入，捐献购买飞机大炮。在支援入藏部队中，许多妇女参加了运输工作。此外，若干少数民族地区展开了三自革新运动，驱逐了假借传教师名义作间谍活动的帝国主义分子。事实证明，各族人民这种反帝爱国的高涨热情，是和民族民主建政工作分不开的。民族区域自治和民族民主联合政府，不仅是加强民族团结的最好组织形式，也是各族人民共同巩固国防、对帝国主义和蒋匪残余作斗争的有力武器。
    民族民主建政工作，也给各民族人民的经济、贸易、卫生、文教事业的发展创造了极为有利的条件。国营贸易公司在各民族地区已设置了一百八十多个贸易分、支公司，组织了三百多个流动贸易生产小组。仅在西康收购藏、彝两族地区的土特产，即值一百四十多亿元。今年运往西康的茶叶，据估计将超过五十万包，约当解放前每年输入的三倍。土产价格，一般的提高到一倍至四倍以上，有的甚至超过十倍；而税收比率，则一般的予以适当降低。此外，各地人民政府并发放大批救济粮和农业、牧业、副业的贷款，同时，兴修水利和交通，解决生产中的困难，大大提高了各族人民的生产积极性。西康省土特产，如羊毛和药材较解放前已增加百分之一百到二百；而药材中的大黄则增加百分之五百。群众的生活因之获得相当的改善。各地的少数民族人民中，出现了要求多纳税、多缴公粮等许许多多的爱国事迹。
    此外，各区恢复和创设卫生院和卫生所一百六十多个，并组织了二十九个巡回医疗队，减费甚至免费为群众治疗疾病。西康藏族自治区在中央人民政府支持下，迅速扑灭了传染达二千里地区的牛瘟，并医治检查预防牛马达二万多头。全区创立民族中学七所、民族师范一所和民族小学近七百所。少数民族现在在大、中、小学校读书的学生已有十三万五千多人。
    为了宣传民族政策，西南民族事务委员会先后出版了藏汉文对照的西南民族画刊（已出版五期）及“西南民族通讯”（已出版四期），译印了藏、苗文的各种文件。为了宣传和平解放西藏办法的协议，每周特别举行藏语广播一次。此外并派电影、幻灯队等去民族区放映，效果良好。
    人民政府所进行的这些工作，各族人民都表示热烈拥护，并积极参加。各族人民从实际的经验中，逐渐相信了自己的力量，也更加懂得汉族人民的援助对本民族解放事业和建设事业的决定作用。
    最后，随着民族民主建政工作的推进，各民族的干部也大量涌现出来。据初步统计，参加区以上人民政府工作的少数民族干部已有八千多人，先后参加过政治学习的各民族青年不下万余人。今年在西南区创立了三个民族学院、两个民族学校和各种民族干部训练班，共已训练三千多干部。这些干部和学员，由于和各族人民有着密切的联系，并在学习和实际工作中得到了提高和锻炼，都成了推动西南区今后民族工作发展的重要力量。经验证明：民族民主建政，固然需要培养一部分干部，但随着建政工作的开展，在实际工作中自然就会涌现出大批的干部来。
    在贵州和云南的民族杂居区，各民族人民都提出了实行土地改革的要求。这些地区，在民族团结的总方针下，根据本民族大多数群众的意志，并取得和群众有联系的领袖人物的同意，依靠本民族自己的干部，采取协商调处的方法，已有领导、有计划、有步骤地开展了土地改革运动。贵州全省四百万少数民族人口的地区中，已有二百万人口的地区实行了土地改革。云南、西昌等地减租退押运动的规模也很大。在斗争和分配果实中大大发扬了民族间尤其是汉族对各少数民族的团结互助精神，壮大了各族农民的声势。因而，各族雇农、贫农、中农的政治觉悟，生产情绪，空前提高。各族人民从土地改革的斗争中，深深体验到民族内部的这种适当改革，对本民族发展的前途有着极为重大的作用，这是少数民族发展进步，逐渐跻于先进民族水平所必须经历的过程。
    总之，西南两年来的经验证明：当前民族工作的中心是民族民主建政。
    三、对今后西南区民族工作的一些意见
    西南区的民族工作虽已获得上述成就，但这仅是工作的开始。因为至今还有大部地区没有实现民族民主建政，没有满足各族人民迫切的政治要求；各种工作长期处于摸索阶段，盲目性很大；若干干部对民族民主建政的重要意义仍认识不足，存在着轻视、忽视和消极拖延的现象，甚至在建政后，仍有潦草从事、形式主义、不善于和各族中与群众有联系的领袖人物团结合作等错误倾向；加以领导干部缺乏经验，对各地及时的思想领导和经验指导十分不够，使工作走了不少弯路。今后我们必须以认真严肃的态度来大力纠正和克服这些缺点。
    今后西南区的民族工作将继续遵循中央“慎重稳进”的方针，根据这次大会关于民族民主建政的各项正确指示，结合西南区的实际情况，作好如下工作：
    一、继续大力推行民族民主建政工作。已建立民族自治区及民族民主联合政府的地区应认真加以巩固和充实，使其能发挥更大的作用。未建立民族自治区及民族民主联合政府的地区则应积极推行，尤其民族的区域自治政策，更需要大力贯彻。
    二、根据实际情况，认真帮助各民族自治区发展生产、贸易、卫生、文教等事业。目前拟进一步开展贸易工作，并有重点地开发水利和建立农场等，逐步向民族区推行先进的生产经验。
    三、积极培养民族干部，加强对现有民族学院、民族学校和各种训练班工作的领导。目前民族干部仍应大量培养。拟开办各种形式的短期的或临时性的、人数多少不等的训练班，大批培养男女青年干部，以应民族工作的急需。而在民族学院中，则须有计划地培养翻译、师资等人材。
    与此同时，在汉族地区的学校中，应注意招收少数民族男女青年入校学习，并须对他们尽可能地加以照顾。根据工作需要也应培养和选派适当的汉族干部参加民族工作。
    四、继续加强民族团结工作，加强民族政策的宣传工作。继续出版和译印民族画刊和各种文件，充分运用幻灯、电影、广播等有效的宣传工具。组织民族参观、访问，以加强民族间的联系和相互学习。
    五、继续加强抗美援朝运动，加强爱国主义和国际主义相结合的教育，克服大民族主义和狭隘民族主义的倾向。这是我们工作中十分重要的一环。
    当然，要做好以上工作，困难是很多的。但是，在毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在中央民族事务委员会具体指导下，依靠西南各兄弟民族坚固一致的团结，我们相信，我们的工作一定会获得新的成就和新的胜利。
    中华人民共和国各民族团结万岁！
    中国各民族人民的领袖毛主席万岁！
