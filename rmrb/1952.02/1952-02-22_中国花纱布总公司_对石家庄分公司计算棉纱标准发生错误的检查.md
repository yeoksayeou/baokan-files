Response to People's Daily Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions:

    To the Editor:
    After the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column published reader Wang Shizhen's criticism on October 22, 1951, regarding errors in the calculation of cotton yarn standards by the Shijiazhuang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch when commissioning factories to weave cloth, our company and the Shijiazhuang Municipal Finance and Economics Committee conducted an inspection of this issue.

    We believe that the processing plant bears full responsibility for this incident due to shoddy workmanship or failure to weave according to specifications. They must compensate for the losses in accordance with the contract. However, the Shijiazhuang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch also committed a serious error of bureaucratism by not discovering that it had overpaid for cotton yarn or that private factories were engaging in shoddy workmanship during the year-long processing period. The relevant staff should conduct a deep self-criticism and earnestly improve their future work. The head office also has shortcomings in its work because the Hebei Provincial Company did not submit the original processing contract and did not take the initiative to inspect.

    The shoddy workmanship of private textile factories is very serious. In the past, state-owned trading departments in various regions had a right-leaning tendency to overly accommodate private factories when handling processing businesses. This not only directly caused losses to state property but also fostered the illegal behavior of some private factories in speculating and engaging in shoddy workmanship. We believe that reasonable industrial profits should be obtained from processing fees, but raw materials must be calculated based on actual usage. Because only in this way can we be meticulous in our calculations and lay a favorable foundation for economic accounting between production and sales parties. We hope that local governments and relevant departments will assist us in thoroughly inspecting the actual situation of yarn and cloth production and the rational standards for required raw materials, so as to promptly correct and prevent the phenomenon of overpaying for cotton yarn and manufacturers engaging in shoddy workmanship.

### 中国花纱布总公司  对石家庄分公司计算棉纱标准发生错误的检查

    中国花纱布总公司
    对石家庄分公司计算棉纱标准发生错误的检查
    编辑同志：一九五一年十月二十二日人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了读者王世震对石家庄花纱布分公司委托厂商织布，计算棉纱标准有错误的批评后，本公司就和石家庄市财政经济委员会对这一问题作了检查。
    我们认为，这一事件的发生，加工厂偷工减料，或不按规格织造，要负全部责任，他们必须按照合同规定，赔偿损失；但石家庄花纱布分公司在一年多的加工过程中，竟没有发觉自己多付了棉纱，也没有发觉私营厂商有偷工减料行为，也犯了严重的官僚主义的错误。有关工作人员，应该深刻检讨，并切实改进今后的工作。总公司因河北省公司没有把原加工合同报来，也没有主动地去检查，工作中也有缺点。
    私营纺织业的偷工减料是很严重的。过去，各地国营贸易部门，处理加工业务时，有过分照顾私营工厂的右倾偏向。这不但直接使国家财产受到损失，而且也助长了部分私营工厂投机取巧、偷工减料的不法行为。我们认为合理工业利润，应该从加工工缴费中取得，但原料必须根据实际用量计算。因为只有这样，才能做到精打细算，并为产销双方实行经济核算打下有利基础。我们希望各地政府和有关部门，协助我们深入检查纱布生产实际情况和需用原料的合理标准，以便及时纠正和防止多付棉纱和厂商偷工减料的现象。
    中国花纱布总公司
