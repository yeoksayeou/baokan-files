    More Than One Hundred Reading Group Members Sign Their Names
    Demanding the People's Government Severely Punish the Traitorous Merchants Who Harmed the Volunteers
    After this newspaper exposed the towering crimes of traitorous merchants Li Yinting, Wang Kangnian, Liu Yunsheng, Zhang Genxin, Yan Hongzhang, and others who poisoned the Volunteers, we have successively received letters from reading groups across the country. These letters express extreme indignation towards the traitorous merchants!
    The comrades of the First, Second, and Third Reading Groups of the Tibetan Language Department of the Central University for Nationalities said in their letters: "Miao grandmothers, Uyghur girls, loggers in the deep mountains, shepherds on the grasslands, imams in mosques, and lamas in lama temples all generously contributed their savings of many years to support the Volunteers who defend the motherland and world peace. But these hateful poisonous snakes are harming our most beloved people behind their backs. We must not tolerate such crimes." They demanded that the People's Government immediately hold a public trial, give these traitorous merchants the most severe punishment, and confiscate all their property. The letter from the Dongsi Ertiao Reading Group in Beijing said: "Bad meat will cause poisoning; rotten cotton will cause festering wounds; dilapidated vehicles will delay military supplies; steel-less iron shovels and iron shears cannot build fortifications or cut electric fences; flimsy rubber shoes will delay marching and combat. In short, this is helping the enemy." They demanded that these traitorous merchants be punished for treason.
    A reader from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army wrote painfully: "Many of our comrades here have been injured in combat. When they saw the news that the wounds of the Volunteer soldiers were festering because of the use of poisonous emergency bandages, they felt a pain that connected flesh and blood!" They jointly demanded that the government immediately give these traitorous merchants the most severe punishment. The letter from all the students of Class One, Junior Two, Department Three of the Beijing Normal University Affiliated High School, said: "The news that the traitorous merchants poisoned the Volunteer uncles aroused boundless anger in everyone. We do not recognize these beastly guys as Chinese!"
    These letters include the handwritten signatures of one hundred and thirteen reading group members. They unanimously demanded that these traitorous merchants be given the most severe punishment. Some letters specifically stated that their opinions were sent to the newspaper after discussions by all the members of the reading group.

    百十余名读报组员亲笔签名
    要求人民政府严惩暗害志愿军的奸商
    本报揭发了奸商李寅廷、王康年、刘云生、张根新、阎宏彰等奸商毒害志愿军的滔天罪行后，陆续收到各地读报组的来信，这些来信，对奸商表示了极度的愤慨！
    中央民族学院语文系藏语组第一、二、三读报组同志们的来信中说：“苗族的老太太、维吾尔族的姑娘、深山里的伐木者、草原上的牧羊人、清真寺里的阿訇、喇嘛庙里的喇嘛，都慷慨地献出自己多年的积蓄，来支持保卫祖国和世界和平的志愿军，但这批令人切齿的毒蛇，却在背后暗害我们最可爱的人，我们决不能容忍他们这种罪行。”他们要求人民政府立即举行公审大会，给这批奸商以最严厉的惩罚，并没收其全部财产。北京东四二条读报组的信里说：“坏肉吃了要中毒；烂棉花包扎伤口要化脓；破烂的车辆，贻误军需；无钢的铁锨、铁剪无法修筑工事和剪截电网；不结实的胶鞋，耽误了行军和作战。总之，这是帮助了敌人。”他们要求把这批奸商以叛国论罪。
    中国人民解放军某部的读报员沉痛地写道：“我们这里有许多因作战而受过伤的同志们，他们看到对志愿军伤员因为使用有毒的救急包而使伤口化脓的消息，感到了一种血肉相联的痛苦！”他们联名要求政府立给这批奸商以最严厉的惩罚。北京师大附中三部初二一班读报组的全体同学的信里说：“奸商们毒害志愿军叔叔们的消息，引起了大家无比的愤恨。这些人面兽心的家伙，我们不承认他们是中国人！”
    这批来信中，包括一百十三名读报组组员的亲笔签名。他们一致要求给这批奸商最严厉的惩罚。有些来信特别声明：他们的意见是经过读报组全体组员讨论后，再寄到报社的。
