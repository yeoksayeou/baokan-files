The Industrial Department of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee fully mobilized the masses in the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and shattered the "offensive and defensive alliances" established by many corrupt elements and unscrupulous merchants. The disintegration of the "offensive and defensive alliance" formed by Wen Qibin, an employee of the department's management office, and ten unscrupulous merchants is a prime example.

Wen Qibin, who was responsible for electrical parts processing and ordering in the Southwest Industrial Department's management office, used his position to collude with ten shops, including private Huaming Electrical Material Store, Xiyuan Electrical Factory, and Liangong Electrical Appliance Store, to steal state property. When the anti-corruption movement began, Wen Qibin and the managers of these electrical shops agreed not to expose or confess. In this way, they formed an "offensive and defensive alliance," vowing to resist the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy to the end.

After the movement began, the staff of the management office were mobilized, and they raised many questions to Wen Qibin. Seeing the increasing pressure from the masses, Wen Qibin became anxious and said to Zhou Wenjun, the manager of the Meichang Electrical Appliance Factory, "The power of the masses is great, and I want to confess." Zhou Wenjun became very worried and immediately stopped him, saying, "I have already prepared the accounts. If you and I don't say anything, no one will know." Wen Qibin also discussed the matter with Zhang Zhongkai, the manager of the Lianggong Electrical Appliance Store, who said, "I have given you three million yuan twice. I personally gave you one million, and no one else knows. The other two million I gave to a landlord to transfer to you, and he won't confess either. They can't find out about the other things." Liu Xiaotao, the manager of the Nanji Electric Company, even tried to cover up for Wen Qibin, saying, "Don't be afraid, even if something happens, I can take part of the responsibility for you." Therefore, Wen Qibin did not mention his relationship with the merchants at all during the movement. When the management office sent people to investigate the electrical shops, the merchants' statements were completely consistent with Wen Qibin's.

However, the power of the masses is strong, and their eyes are sharp. At the confession and exposure meeting, the masses revealed the fact that Wen Qibin received a kickback of 500,000 yuan for introducing Wanxin Yarn Factory to buy lubricating oil last January, as well as the fact that Huigong Iron Factory bribed him with 1.5 million yuan. Under the pressure of the masses, Wen Qibin felt that he could not delay any longer and confessed to embezzling 20 million yuan. However, he still dared not reveal the conspiracy of forming an "offensive and defensive alliance." After the meeting, he was restless and thought: What if I don't confess, and the merchants confess? What if the merchants don't confess, and the shop assistants expose me? He became even more afraid when he thought of the suspicion and anger of the masses at the meeting, and he couldn't even eat. At this time, staff from the Southwest Procuratorate spoke with him, explaining that if he did not confess, he would only be sent to court, but if he confessed, he could receive lenient treatment from the people. After repeated ideological struggles, Wen Qibin finally confessed that the Xiyuan, Lianggong, and Meichang electrical shops had colluded with him to steal more than 12 million yuan of state property. But he did not confess everything. At the second meeting, the masses continued to raise many questions and cited the fact that the Nanji Electrical Store and the Mingji Motor Repair Factory each bribed him with one million yuan. The leaders of the management office also accepted the opinions of the masses and sent him to the court according to law. In this way, Wen Qibin could not deny it under the pressure of the masses and successively wrote four confessions, confessing to embezzling 40.98 million yuan and the crime of forming an "offensive and defensive alliance" with the merchants.

After Wen Qibin confessed, the managers of the ten business firms that had formed an "offensive and defensive alliance" with Wen Qibin initially tried to deny it, but later they were finally forced to admit the crimes of bribery and stealing state property. The "offensive and defensive alliance" thus disintegrated. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西南军政委员会工业部充分发动群众
    击破贪污分子和奸商的“攻守同盟”
    西南军政委员会工业部在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，充分发动群众，击破了许多贪污分子和奸商订立的“攻守同盟”。该部经理处职员文启彬和十家奸商订立的“攻守同盟”的瓦解，就是一个最好的例子。
    文启彬在西南工业部经理处担任电器部分加工订货工作，平时利用业务上的方便，勾结私营华明电料行、西原电料厂、联工电器行等十家商店，共同盗窃国家财产。反贪污运动开始时，文启彬就和这些电料行经理商定不检举，不坦白。这样，他们便订立了“攻守同盟”，相约对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动抗拒到底。
    运动展开后，经理处的工作人员都发动起来了，他们向文启彬提出很多质问。文启彬看到群众的压力加大了，有点着慌，便向美昌电器厂经理周文俊说：“群众力量很大，我想要坦白了。”周文俊听了很着急，马上阻止他说：“我已经做好帐了，你我不说，不会有人知道。”文启彬又和联工电器行经理张仲凯商谈，张仲凯说：“我两次送了你三百万元，一百万是我亲自交给你的，没有旁人知道，另外两百万是我交一个地主转给你的，他也不会坦白；其他的事情，他们更查不出来。”南极电业社经理刘晓涛甚至想法为文启彬掩护，向他说：“你不要害怕，即使出了事，我也可以为你承担一部。”因此，文启彬在运动中对他和商人的关系一字不提。经理处派人到各电料行调查时，商人说的和文启彬说的完全一致。
    但是，群众的力量强大，眼睛明亮。在坦白检举大会上，群众揭发出去年一月文启彬介绍万新纱厂买黄油，得了回扣五十万元，以及惠工铁工厂向他行贿一百五十万元的事实。在群众压力下，文启彬感到拖不下去，陆续坦白出贪污两千万元的事实。订立“攻守同盟”的勾当，他还是不敢说出来。会后，他坐立不安，心里想：如果我不坦白，商人坦白了怎么办？商人不坦白，店员揭发了怎么办？他想到大会上群众对他的怀疑和愤怒，就更加害怕起来，连饭也吃不下。这时，西南检察署派工作人员和他谈话，向他说明：假如不坦白，只有送法院，不如坦白了还可以得到人民宽大处理。经过三番五次的思想斗争，文启彬终于坦白出西原、联工、美昌三家电料行曾和他勾结一起盗窃国家财产一千二百多万元。但是他并未全部坦白，在第二次大会上，群众继续提出许多疑问，并举出南极电料行、明记电机修理厂各向他行贿一百万元的事实。经理处领导方面并且接受了群众的意见，依法将他押送法院。这样，文启彬在群众压力下无法抵赖，又先后写了四次坦白书，坦白出贪污四千零九十八万元以及和商人订立“攻守同盟”的罪行。
    文启彬坦白后，十家和文启彬订立“攻守同盟”的商号经理，先还想抵赖，但是后来也终于被迫陆续承认了行贿和盗窃国家财产的罪行。“攻守同盟”便这样瓦解了。  （新华社）
