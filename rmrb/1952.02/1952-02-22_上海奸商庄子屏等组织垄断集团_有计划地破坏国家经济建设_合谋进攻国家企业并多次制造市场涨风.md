Shanghai's unscrupulous merchants in the hardware business, led by Zhuang Ziping, the owner of the large unscrupulous merchant Zhuang Zi Ji Hardware Store, organized a monopolistic group after liberation to systematically attack state-owned enterprises and undermine national economic construction. This major illegal activity of the unscrupulous merchants has now been exposed.

Zhuang Zi Ji Hardware Store is located on Beijing East Road in Shanghai. In order to steal state property on a large scale, Zhuang Ziping, the owner of the store, joined forces with Wu Yuan, Wu Kang, Jiu Yuan, Yi He Xiang, and other hardware stores. From June 1950, they jointly booked rooms in the International Hotel and the Hui Zhong Hotel for a long time, as a place for regular meetings and planning. They adopted a "division of labor and cooperation" approach, with each responsible for contacting state-owned enterprises, and each sending special personnel to bribe relevant personnel in the offices, acceptance departments, and warehouses of the enterprises they contacted, setting up strongholds. Once they stole the state's procurement plans, they quickly gathered at the International Hotel or the Hui Zhong Hotel to discuss ways to defraud state property.

This hardware business monopoly group's means of attacking state-owned enterprises were extremely vicious. In order to corrupt cadres through their lifestyle, they kept a "social butterfly" near Kunshan Garden, specifically to take the cadres they needed to seduce to dance or play cards. If a state-owned enterprise was a big buyer, they would not hesitate to invest heavily, even for a small transaction the first time. In February 1950, the Huainan Coal Mine's Shanghai office purchased 200 six-inch galvanized iron pipes from Zhuang Zi Ji, worth only about 100 million yuan, but Zhuang actually bribed the office's representative with two large gold bars. This monopoly group frequently used the method of "pulling over" cadres in order to steal the procurement plans of state-owned enterprises and the bid documents of competitors, in order to exclude competitors, monopolize the market, and steal state property. In 1950, when Shanghai's economic situation began to improve, Zhuang Ziping colluded with a staff member of the Machinery and Materials Department of the East China Textile Administration Bureau to steal the procurement plan of the East China Textile Administration Bureau for importing a large number of Seddin pipes. After obtaining the plan, he arranged for the five companies to quote separately. When quoting, they often had four companies quote high and one slightly lower. As a result, although the transaction was concluded at a lower price, this "low price" was much higher than the market price. If they found out the quotations of other firms, they often bid at a slightly lower price, but then played tricks, claiming that they had only imported a small amount of goods and could not sell much; if they wanted to sell more, they would have to raise the price.

Whenever the big unscrupulous merchant Zhuang Ziping traded with state-owned enterprises, he always falsely claimed that he had imported a large amount of goods in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and other places. After the business was secured and a deposit was obtained, he would go to the market to collect waste pipes and old pipes, and hand them over to Xin Da, Ming Feng, Hui Feng, and other pipe drawing factories for processing. They painted black iron pipes with red lead powder to impersonate Seddin pipes, electroplated old pipes to impersonate new goods, and used stove pipes to make Seddin pipes. Then, through bribed corrupt elements, they delivered the goods at high prices, sometimes several times higher than the original price.

The monopoly group formed by the big unscrupulous merchant Zhuang Ziping had repeatedly created market price hikes. For example, in July 1950, the Shanghai Electric Power Company, through the introduction of the Xu Xinglong Boiler Factory, purchased 2,000 feet of pipes from Zhuang Zi Ji at a unit price of 5,760 yuan per foot. When Zhuang Ziping accepted the business, he pretended that the goods were in Tianjin. When the Xu Xinglong Boiler Factory went to Zhuang Zi Ji to pick up the goods, Zhuang actually claimed "no goods", and then directly negotiated with the Shanghai Electric Power Company, and raised the price to 70,000 or 80,000 yuan per foot, thus creating a soaring market price for a time.

Because the monopoly group formed by the big unscrupulous merchant Zhuang Ziping systematically attacked state-owned enterprises, state property suffered very serious losses. Taking Zhuang Zi Ji alone, from July 1950 to May 1951, the East China Textile Administration Bureau's purchases from Zhuang Zi Ji amounted to more than 2.285 billion yuan. Because Zhuang used black iron pipes to impersonate Seddin pipes and old goods to impersonate new goods, the East China Textile Administration Bureau suffered a loss of more than 770 million yuan. The goods sold by Zhuang Zi Ji and currently stored in the first and second machinery and materials warehouses of the East China Textile Administration Bureau, of which 98% of the steel pipes of various specifications are fake goods. Another example is that the Hebei Provincial Publicly-Owned Dyeing and Weaving Company entrusted the Shanghai Hardware Machinery Branch Company to purchase 59 feet and 6 inches of 1.5-inch Seddin pipes from Zhuang Zi Ji, with a specified pressure of 300 pounds. In order to greedily seek illegal profits, Zhuang ignored the safety of workers' lives and mixed old Japanese black iron pipes, with a pressure of only 120 pounds, to impersonate them. When the installation was completed and was about to be used, it was fortunately discovered by the Hardware Machinery Branch Company, which urgently telegraphed to stop using it, so that no accident occurred. The same incident happened with the pipes sold to the Shanghai Wire Factory. These are just two examples. Since public factories and mines all over the country purchased a lot of goods from this group, the losses to the national economic construction projects can be imagined.

    上海奸商庄子屏等组织垄断集团
    有计划地破坏国家经济建设
    合谋进攻国家企业并多次制造市场涨风
    上海市五金商业中的奸商们以大奸商庄子记五金号老板庄子屏为首，在解放后组织了一个垄断性的集团，有计划地向国家企业进攻，破坏国家经济建设。奸商们的这一重大的不法行为现已被揭露。
    庄子记五金号设在上海北京东路。为了大规模地盗骗国家财产，该号老板庄子屏联合五源、五康、久源、怡和祥等五金号，从一九五零年六月起就共同在国际饭店和汇中饭店长期包了房间，作为经常开会策划的地方。他们采取“分工合作”的方式，分别负责联系国营企业单位，各派专人向联系的企业单位的办公室、验收处和仓库的有关人员行贿，安设据点。一旦窃取到国家的采购计划后，他们便迅速集中到国际饭店或汇中饭店开会，共同商议骗取国家财产的办法。
    这个五金商业的垄断集团向国营企业进攻的手段是极其毒辣的。为了达到从生活上腐化干部的目的，他们在崑山花园附近豢养了一个“交际花”，专门带他们需要勾引的干部去跳舞或打牌。如果某个国营企业是大买主，第一次即使是一笔小额交易，他们也不惜投下大本钱。一九五零年二月，淮南煤矿驻上海办事处向庄子记买进六寸白铁管子两百根，货价不过一亿元左右，而庄竟以金条两大根向这个办事处的处代表行贿。这个垄断集团经常使用“拉过来”的方法俘掳干部，以便窃取国家企业的采购计划和同业中投标的标单，以达到他们排挤同业独占市场窃取国家财产的目的。一九五零年上海经济情况开始好转时，庄子屏就串通华东纺织管理局机料处职员窃取到华东纺织管理局要进大批泗汀管的采购计划，计划到手后，他便布置由五家分头报价。报价时，他们经常是四家高一家稍低，结果虽以较低的价格成交，而这“低价”却比市价高出很多。如果探听到其他行号的报价，他们也常以稍低的价格投标，但随着又玩花巧，声明自己进货很少，不能多卖；要多卖只有提价。
    大奸商庄子屏每次和国营企业交易时，总是诡称在香港、广州、天津等地已经大量进货。待生意到手，骗取到定金后，才去市场上收进废管旧管，交给鑫大、铭丰、惠丰等拉管厂代为加工。他们把黑铁管涂上红丹粉冒充泗汀管，把旧管子电镀后冒充新货，把炉子管拉制泗汀管，然后通过受贿的贪污分子高价交货，价格有时竟高过原价好几倍。
    大奸商庄子屏组成的垄断集团曾多次制造市场的涨风。如一九五零年七月，上海电力公司经徐兴隆锅炉厂介绍向庄子记买进管子两千尺，每尺单价五千七百六十元。庄子屏在接生意时，佯言货在天津，等到徐兴隆锅炉厂向庄子记提货时，庄竟推说“没有货”，一面又直接和上海电力公司交涉，并把价格提高到七、八万元一尺，因而一度造成市场价格的飞涨。
    由于大奸商庄子屏组成垄断集团有计划地向国营企业进攻，使国家财产受到非常严重的损失。单拿庄子记一家来说，一九五零年七月至一九五一年五月，华东纺织管理局向庄子记进货额共达二十二亿八千五百多万元，由于庄以黑铁管充泗汀管，旧货充新货，华东纺织管理局所受损失就有七亿七千多万元；华东纺织管理局第一、第二机料库现存庄子记售出的货品，其中各种规范的钢管有百分之九十八都是假货。又如河北省公营染织公司委托上海五金机器分公司向庄子记买进一寸半泗汀管五十九尺六寸，规定压力三百磅。庄为贪图非法利润，竟不顾工人生命安全，以旧日本货黑铁管混充，压力仅一百二十磅，装置竣工正拟使用时，幸为五金机器分公司发觉，急电停用，才没发生事故。卖给上海电线厂的管子，也有同样的事件发生。这只是两个例子而已。由于全国各地公营厂矿向这一集团买进的货品很多，国家经济建设工程上的损失可想而知。
