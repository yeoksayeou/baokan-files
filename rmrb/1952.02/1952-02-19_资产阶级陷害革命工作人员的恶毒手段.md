The frantic attacks of the bourgeoisie against the working class over the past three years have included not only frontal, open, and ferocious assaults but also, more insidiously, the subtle setting of traps and pitfalls or the silent firing of cold arrows from behind.

	Tentative Offensives

When dealing with state organs, profiteers or their agents always carry some high-quality cigarettes, feigning "borrowing a light," offering them to everyone they meet, chatting and laughing, being amiable and approachable, and making small talk with the staff, discussing their moods. This is how they probe the "background" and "hearts" of many people. When they find what seems to be a gap or a weak link, they launch a tentative offensive: "If this deal goes through, you'll have put in the work, so here's a little introduction fee, it's only right." "It's the old rule of the trade, take it!" If you don't reach out, they'll come again: "Take it, it's nothing, Director Li from your office already accepted a share." "It's dark and quiet, just you and I know about this, we understand each other, so you can rest assured!" If you still don't take it, they have another trick: "It's just a little something, now that I've taken it out, wouldn't it make me, old Wang, look bad if you didn't accept it?" "This isn't a bribe, it's just a personal gift from a new friend." If you still refuse, they'll use other tricks to get you hooked. They'll put the money in a reed bag with a layer of fruit on top, sending it to your home while you're out, saying you asked them to bring it back; they'll seize the opportunity during the New Year and holidays to wrap the money in a neat, square red packet and send it to your door; they think that this way you might consider it somewhat "cleaner."

The main weapon of the bourgeoisie in poisoning revolutionary cadres is, of course, the "money" they cruelly exploit from the working people, stained with the blood and sweat of the people. However, this weapon is too obvious and too easy to defend against; therefore, they rack their brains to disguise their weapons in various ways. Moreover, before they launch an offensive, they first use various methods to disarm you. They always want you to feel that you've benefited from them, yet that you haven't done anything wrong. If they invite you to dinner, they'll say "This isn't specially prepared for you, I'm inviting a friend today." They'll measure your shoe size while you're asleep, make a pair of leather shoes, and then say to you: "Your shoes are too broken, how shabby. I have a pair of leather shoes that are too small for me, unused, try them on and see if they fit?" They'll deliberately say their fountain pen is out of ink, borrow your pen, and then say your Xinmin pen is very good, insisting on "exchanging" it with the Parker pen they prepared in advance. If they want to drag you into a dance hall or brothel, they'll say to you: "Go, you revolutionary cadres have to do mass work, you should see more of the world. Take a look around, it won't dirty you!" They've determined that some people can't resist this kind of temptation. After tasting some "sweetness" from the "sugar-coated" bullets, and after "visiting" the bourgeois lifestyle, some pure revolutionary workers forget their revolutionary goals and are bewitched, saying: "I didn't know there was another kind of life in the same city, so free and intoxicating!" They fall shamefully into the putrid, rotten mud of this "other life."

	Catering to Preferences, Exploiting Weaknesses

Profiteers use their unique noses to sniff around everywhere; they carefully observe your every move, every word, every smile. If they see what you like, they'll offer it; if that doesn't work, they'll try something else. They always find a suitable target to hit you. If you say you want to buy a leather coat but don't know how to judge the quality, they'll say "I'm an expert." If they hear you want to buy a watch, they'll say to you "I'm very familiar with watch shops, I can get a 30% discount." In fact, they don't know anything about leather goods, nor do they have any acquaintances in watch shops; they deliberately buy one to give you, but only pay half price. If you like to play chess, they'll specially buy a set of exquisite chess pieces and pretend to love playing chess themselves; they become your "chess friends" and deliberately lose a few games to satisfy you. If you like to play cards, they'll find an opportunity to bring a few people to play, deliberately losing money, subtly placing bribes in your hands. If you don't accept anything from them, but just like to go sightseeing in your spare time, they'll drive up in their car on Sunday morning, asking you to go on a trip with them. When you get to some park, they insist on taking a "group photo" with a bunch of shady merchants and dancing girls; although you're unwilling, you can't refuse their "kindness." Once the photo is in their hands, they have a handle to slander and threaten you, and they also have "capital" to brag and swindle everywhere, boasting that they have a "friend" who is a leader in some organization.

	"Human Relations"

When attacking a person multiple times and failing to hit the mark, profiteers look for "firing positions" around that person. They thoroughly investigate your family life, your relationships with relatives and friends, your education and experience. Many cadres in the Changzhou District of Southern Jiangsu are from Northern Jiangsu, so the merchants of Changzhou sent many people to Northern Jiangsu to specifically understand the cadres' family situations and find ways to attack. Your parents, spouse, siblings, and even distant relatives can become targets for the profiteers' artillery fire. The profiteers first capture them and then use them as assistant gunners in their attack on you, or as unwitting gun carriages, putting you in a situation of being surrounded on all sides. If you and your spouse are worried about not being able to find a place for your child, they'll find a private daycare center for you, sending the child there and constantly sending things; by the time you find out, the items are already old, and you can't afford to compensate, so you have to let it go. If they happen to see a letter from your mother in the countryside saying that life is difficult due to the disaster, they'll secretly copy the address and send money; or they'll deliberately detour to your hometown when they're out, sending the money. They also consider your father's death or your sister's wedding to be good opportunities to launch an offensive by sending money. They even find out the birthdays of your parents, wife, and children; before you even think of it, they'll send gifts to your door: "Today is the old lady's birthday, here's a small gift." They try every possible means to find out that you're the brother of your sister-in-law's maternal aunt's husband, wanting to claim kinship and recognize it as a "good route" for launching an offensive. Even if you've never met them before, they can claim to be from the same hometown as you; they ask their youngest son to bow and call you "godfather"; they want to introduce their eldest daughter to your nephew as a "partner." If you were classmates with them for a year or six months in elementary or middle school, they won't let go of this opportunity; they pretend to be so kind and talk to you about scenes from your school days, evoking your nostalgia. Then, they make you see only "human relations," forgetting class, forgetting the country, forgetting the people.

	"Honey Trap"

If money, material goods, and "human relations" can't move the cadre's heart, profiteers use women. In the eyes of capitalists, women are just toys and commodities. They exploit women enough, and then use them as bait to lure people into traps. They'll shamelessly pat you on the shoulder and ask: "Little brother, are you married? Do you want women?" If they know you don't have a partner yet, they'll say: "Brother, you've been doing revolution for several years, and you don't have a partner, how hard! Let me introduce you to one, what do you think? This person is my wife's classmate, she's very attractive!" If they know you don't get along with your wife, profiteers will also come to provoke: "A man like you should find a good wife who suits you; get divorced, it won't be hard to find another, I'll help!" If they see that your wife isn't around, they'll want to "find you a girlfriend to play with," "Guaranteed to find one, guaranteed to be satisfied!" They can hire a prostitute, saying she's their cousin, introducing her to you to mess around with. They can call a prostitute to your room. Some capitalists even let their wives go out in person, openly and shamelessly saying: "I have two wives, come to my house and play!" Some big profiteers sacrifice their daughters to seduce staff members of state enterprises and organizations to stay in hotels. Some female profiteers are no different from prostitutes, relying on selling their looks to seduce cadres and set up large companies.

They'll tell you: "Eating, dancing, socializing, and entertaining are also working methods. The big city is different from the countryside, you can't work if you don't learn this set of skills?" "This is just playing the field, why take it seriously? No one who's out and about is that clean." "What are you afraid of, change into civilian clothes, and it'll be fine?" If you're still unwilling to take the bait, they'll attack in another way: "You're so feudal, so unenlightened, and you're still an old revolutionary!"

You finally slip up and contract a venereal disease. You don't dare go to the clinic in your own organization, and you don't have the money to treat it; the profiteer sees that you're worried about this and comes again: "I'll take responsibility for curing your illness, whatever it costs is on me." They take you to get injections and medicine, further tying you to their coattails.

	"Praising" You to the Skies

If they can't attack you with any of the above methods, profiteers have even more vicious shells. They try their best to praise you, flattering you so much that you're confused and fall into their hypnotic trap. When they see young cadres, they say: "This comrade is really good, young and promising, and capable!" When they see you wearing a woolen uniform, they rush to light your cigarette and pour your tea; and when they hear you speaking with a southern accent, they keep flattering you: "Old revolutionary, your contribution is really great, not simple, not simple at all!" "You're like my old superior, I'll definitely have a way out if I follow you." Even if you're just an ordinary staff member, they can call you "leader" all the time. When they hold a party inviting cadres they have dealings with to participate; when the cadres enter the door, they shout: "The first and second rows are reserved for the leaders!" "Everyone stand up and applaud!" Didn't the profiteers call the big embezzler Song Degui, who was executed not long ago, "Lord Song?" After swindling carloads of wood, didn't they throw a banquet and hold a "celebration meeting for the victory of wood procurement" (actually a "celebration meeting for the victory of theft and embezzlement"), toasting Song Degui and shouting "Long live Director Song?" They just want to lift some revolutionary cadres high into the clouds until they fall, falling to the same fate as their "Lord Song!"

	The Great Detour

If "praising" still doesn't work, the profiteers have another trick: being serious and putting on the face of a progressive person, "casting a long line to catch a big fish," taking a great detour to launch an offensive against revolutionary cadres. They'll say: "I've long wanted to join the revolution, but unfortunately, my family has too many people, and I can't help but do this business. Fortunately, developing production is also serving the people." They'll fabricate a background: "I used to be a revolutionary too, I was in the district committee of the third district of Zhengding; later I came to Shijiazhuang to do underground work, lost contact, and had to make a living by doing business." Or say: "Old Li, it's been so many years, I'm too backward, come to my place often in the future, help me study and make progress!" To cater to your heart, they take off their suits and put on cadre uniforms. They try their best to make you hear what you want to hear and see what you want to see; they try their best to pretend to be progressive and honest, deceiving your trust and making you paralyzed, believing that they have no malice, and developing feelings for them; then, they gradually go deeper, attacking your heart. "This radio is useless to me, take it, listen to current affairs, it can help you study." "Hardship is absolutely necessary, but serving the people, health is also important, take this glucose to nourish yourself!" After going around in many big circles, in the final analysis, they lead you back to the road of destruction.

	Siege

When single-handed sneak attacks are ineffective, profiteers deploy large-scale formations.

Some big profiteers, the biggest sugar-coated bullet factories, are disguised in many ways. He himself pretends to be serious, seemingly the most honest and enlightened "industrialist." His "basic brand" is also relatively regular. But he opens many small factories and shops, hires some people, or uses his relatives as managers, specifically engaging in illegal activities, and it doesn't matter if the government finds out and closes them down. Such big profiteers never come forward, at most calling on their sons and daughters to come forward, and he manipulates everything behind the scenes, directing his troops to attack state organs. He even specially opens restaurants, hotels, dance halls, and "tea houses" as offensive positions. He directs a group of lackeys to surround revolutionary cadres. Some play the red face, some play the white face, some sing Qingyi, some sing Huadan, setting up a formation around you, so that you finally become a prisoner. "Once one person is hooked, a gang of thieves comes to eat the meat." As long as they break through a little, they inform each other, and a large group of profiteers attacks you in turn, like a swarm of flies pouncing on your body and face, pestering you over and over again. Some say in a half-joking, half-threatening tone: "It's all about making friends, however they treat you, we'll treat you the same way, we'll never lose money in the deal." "If you don't do the same as Manager Zhao, I'll sue you!" They have even more vicious methods. After opening a gap in one organization, they want you to introduce their people to go in; after breaking in, it's even more convenient to pull out more people, and break in more people; they make those who are unwilling to take the bait subject to satire, abuse, attacks, and exclusion, launching a siege against upright cadres from within. Finally, they completely turn an organization into a bourgeois organization.

	Rogue-Style Assassination

Profiteers have all the characteristics of a big rogue. They'll act like a hooligan, extorting and deceiving, and using insidious and vicious methods to assassinate you. As long as they grab a little pigtail of yours, if you don't have the determination to quickly cut off the pigtail, you're in a dilemma.

"I like to make friends, let's go have a couple of drinks today!" If you say you can't drink, he says it's okay to drink some beer. As you drink, he adds strong liquor, until he gets you drunk. After you're drunk, he can play many tricks. He can have you sign an unreasonable contract; he can drag you to unclean places. He can also put one million yuan in your pocket. If you find it the next day and want to return it, he immediately changes his face: "I gave you ten million! You still want to pretend to be serious and not accept bribes, then you return the ten million to me!" Everyone knows that you drank with him, and you can't produce ten million yuan, so you have to take the bait. When an illegal act he committed is found out and he's about to be punished, he'll beg you bitterly, saying how difficult his family's life is, crying and attracting your sympathy. After you secretly exempt him from the fine, he has a good opportunity to bribe: "You're my savior, I want to repay you!" If you don't accept, he can turn around again: "I'll just confess the last thing to the government, what do you think?" He first bribes a little, asking a railway worker to secretly sell him a section of a train car; the second time, he wants two sections; the third time, he wants four sections. If you don't dare to agree, he says: "If you don't do it, I'll 'reveal' everything we've done in the past."

He first uses reverse psychology to deliberately ridicule you, looking down on you: "Look at Comrade Huang wearing a woolen uniform, how majestic! Why are you still wearing a broken cotton jacket after working for so many years?" "Why are you, an old cadre, still smoking yellow tobacco?" "We're going to switch to first-class seats. Are you still going to sit in third-class hard seats according to the rules?" After arousing your face-saving vanity, they have an opportunity to take advantage of. If an old cadre is not satisfied with his position, the profiteer will also seize on it and use it: "You're an uncultured old roughneck, and you'll be less and less successful. After working for so many years, you're still a small staff member! Let's open a shop together, it's more enjoyable than being a small cadre."

Some openly say: "I used to be a spy, I'm registered with the Public Security Bureau. If you don't do that thing with me, I'll bite you and report that you used to be my accomplice, can you stand it?"

After the profiteer has tightened his trap around you, when things get big, he's afraid of being exposed, so he uses even more ruthless methods to manipulate you. He'll harshly take off your cadre hat and throw it on the ground, threatening you to swindle one last sum of money, completely abandon the revolution, and abscond with the money with him. On the way, he'll leave you behind, taking the money and sneaking away.

	Once Useless, Kicked Aside

When the profiteer needs you, they put on such a sweet smile: "Just say the word when you need money, go to my house to get it, no matter how much. Can you not make friends when doing things in society? More friends, more ways." "It's all the same between brothers, who cares whose it is, yours is mine, mine is yours, this is communism, hee hee!" He'll even say sourly: "Making friends requires sincerity, those who make friends don't abandon, those who abandon don't make friends." "Old Zhou, work hard for us, if the company fires you, I'll support you for the rest of your life. Not to mention one, six or seven is nothing. If you want to marry a wife, you can choose from the sixty or seventy female workers in our factory." When you're really fired, you're useless to him, and he'll immediately kick you aside, he won't even bother to listen to you when you beg him. He used to be so kind in finding you a house; when you're transferred to a new job and can't help him anymore, he'll kick you out immediately; even if your wife is giving birth, he won't care, "I don't care if you raise your child on the street, get out of here immediately!" If you're transferred to work elsewhere, and you can't help him anymore, he'll ask you to "settle the account" immediately, asking you to "spit out" all the bribes you took from him in the past, otherwise, "I'll report you." In Shenyang, a cadre who took bribes was transferred to work elsewhere, and his wife still lived in the profiteer's house; he felt that this cadre was useless to him, so he arbitrarily bullied his wife, and even spread rumors that "he found someone else elsewhere and doesn't want you anymore." He forced her to be a prostitute, and even wanted to rape her. This cadre had a handle in the profiteer's hands, and could only swallow his anger like a mute eating Coptis chinensis.

	Comrades, Be Vigilant!

This is how the bourgeoisie launches vicious attacks on revolutionary workers. These ugly things are just what you see when you lift a corner of the bourgeoisie's "gorgeous" curtain. And some things are so ugly that we're even afraid of soiling the white paper, afraid of insulting the reader's eyes, and can't display them all nakedly here.

Perhaps some people don't dare to believe these things, so you can just ask a few profiteers! You can ask Dong Jianwen, the manager of the former "Haitong Trading Company" in Beijing, Zhou Hongen, the manager of "Hongda Trading Company" in Shenyang, Sun Dakai, the manager of Huaxing Agricultural Tool Hardware Machinery Factory in Shanghai, Lu Qingxiu, the manager of Shenji Hardware Store in Shijiazhuang, Su Dan, the manager of Dongya Construction Factory in Changsha, and Zhang Guangfu, the deputy manager of Datong Transportation Company in Xi'an; you can even ask the big boss of Xinhua Lumber Company in Tianjin, who bribed sixty-three organizations and one hundred and four cadres. Or just ask any other profiteer. They should be able to point out which of these things they've done.

What exactly is a "sugar-coated bullet?" The above is a simple anatomical diagram.

The bourgeoisie has even uglier, more shameless, more insidious, and more vicious weapons.

Comrades, be vigilant!

    资产阶级陷害革命工作人员的恶毒手段
    燕凌
    三年来资产阶级向工人阶级的猖狂进攻，除了正面的公开的张牙舞爪的猛扑之外，更狠毒的是巧妙地布置下许多圈套和陷阱，或者从你背后悄悄地射来几支冷箭。
    　试探性的进攻
    奸商或者他们的代理人，到国家机关里打交道，腰里总会揣上一些上等香烟，假装“借火”，逢人就送，嘻嘻哈哈，和善可亲，和工作人员们拉家常，谈心情。他们就这样来摸许多人的“家底”、“心底”，摸着似乎是缝隙的地方或是薄弱的一环，就发动试探性的进攻：“成了一笔生意，你也辛苦了，这是一点介绍费拿去吧，理所应当。”“买卖里的老规矩，收下吧！”你不伸手，他接着就又来了：“收下吧，没事，你们那里李主任早就接了一份。”“天黑人静，这事就咱二人知道，心照不宣，你尽管放心！”你还是不收，他还有一套：“一点点小意思，既拿出来，你不收不是给我老王不好看吗？”“这不是贿赂，是做为一个新朋友个人送你的。”你依然不收，过后他还会用别的圈套来套你上钩。他会把钱放在蒲包里，上面放一层水果，趁你不在，送到你家里，说是你要他带回来的；他会抓紧过年过节的机会，把钱包成一个方方正正的红纸包，送上门来；他认为似乎这样你就可以认为比较“干净”些了。
    资产阶级毒害革命干部的主要武器，自然是他们残酷剥削劳动人民得来的染满人民血汗的“钱”。不过，这个武器太扎眼，太容易使人防备；因此，他们就挖空心思，用种种办法把他们的武器伪装起来。而且，在他们发动进攻之前，先要用种种办法解除你的武装。他总要使你既感到沾了他的光，又似乎没有做什么亏心事。他留你吃饭，就说“这不是特意为你预备的，我今天要请一个朋友”。他趁你睡着时，量了你的鞋子的大小，做好一双皮鞋，然后向你说：“你这鞋太破了，多寒伧。我有一双皮鞋，自己穿着小，没有用，你试试行不行？”他故意说自己的水笔没有墨水了，借你的水笔用，然后说你的新民笔很好用，硬要把他早预备好的派克水笔和你“交换”。他要拉你进舞厅、妓院，就向你说：“去吧，你们革命干部要做群众工作，应当多见见世面。参观参观，沾不脏你！”他们看准了某些人是经不起这种引诱的。有些纯洁的革命工作人员，在吃了“糖衣”的一些“甜头”之后，在“参观”了资产阶级的生活方式之后，就被弄得忘了革命的远大前途，鬼迷心窍地说：“我不知道原来同一个城市中还有这样自由自在的、令人陶醉的另一种生活！”他们就可耻地陷落在这腐朽发臭的、糜烂的“另一种生活”的泥浆里了。
    　　投其所好，乘虚而入
    奸商们用他们特有的鼻子到处乱嗅，你一举一动，一言一笑，他都细心观察。看到你喜欢什么，他就来什么，这样不行，再换那样。他总要找一个适当的射击目标，把你打中。你说想买个皮大衣，可是不懂货色，他就说“我可是个行家”。听说你想买个表，他就对你说“表行我很熟，可以打七扣”。其实他根本不懂皮货，也没什么熟人在钟表店，他特意去买了送给你，而只要一半价钱。你爱下象棋，他就专买一副精致的棋子放着，自己也装作爱下棋的样子；他和你成了“棋友”，而且故意多输几盘，使你心满意足。你爱玩扑克，他也就找机会拉几个人来玩，故意输钱，无形中把贿赂送到你的手里。你什么都不接受他的，只是爱在公余出去游山玩水，他在星期日早上就把汽车开来了，要你跟他一起郊游。到了什么公园，他硬要拉你和一堆乌七八糟的商人、舞女来一张“合影留念”，你虽不乐意，但“盛情难却”。照片一到他手里，他就有了诬蔑你、威胁你的把柄，也有了“资本”向各处招摇撞骗，夸耀他有一个“朋友”是某机关的什么首长。
    “人情”
    向一个人进攻多次，怎么也射击不中时，奸商就从这个人的周围寻找“炮位”。他们多方面调查研究你的家庭生活，你的亲朋关系，你的学历经历。苏南常州分区的干部，有很多是苏北人，常州的商人们就派了好多人去苏北，专门了解干部的家庭情况，找寻进攻的道路。你的父母、爱人、兄弟姐妹以至表亲，都会成为奸商们开炮的目标。奸商先俘掳了他们，然后利用他们作为向你进攻的副炮手，或者作了不自觉的炮架子，把你陷于四面被围的境地。你和爱人正为孩子没法安置而苦恼，他就替你找一个私立的托儿所，把孩子送去，还不断送东西去；到你发现时，东西已经用旧了，又赔不起，只好算了。偶然看到你母亲从乡下来信说，因为灾荒，生活困难，他就偷偷抄下地址，寄了钱去；或者在外出时故意绕道到你家乡，把钱送去。你父亲死了他也要当作向你发动进攻的好时机，你妹妹结婚他也不放过送钱的“机会”。他甚至把你父母妻子儿女的生日都打听清楚了，连你自己还没有想到，他就送礼上门了：“今天是老太太的大寿，送点薄礼。”他千方百计地打听出你是他的嫂嫂的娘家姑姑的丈夫的弟弟，也要来攀“亲戚”，认作发动进攻的“好路线”。虽然你过去根本不认识他，他也可以和你攀“同乡”；他要他的小儿子鞠躬作揖拜你做“干爹”；要把他的大女儿介绍给你的侄子做“对象”。你和他在小学、中学时同过一年半年学，他也不放松这个机遇，他装着多么亲亲切切，和你谈起同学时的一些情景，引起你的怀旧之情。然后，就使你只看见“人情”，忘掉了阶级，忘掉了国家，忘掉了人民。
    “美人计”
    金钱、物质、“人情”都打不动干部的心，奸商就用上了女人。女人在资本家的眼睛里就是玩物和商品。他们蹧蹋够了女人，还要拿女人做骗人上钩的钓饵。他会无耻地拍着你的肩膀问：“老弟结婚了没有？想娘儿们吗？”知道你还没有爱人，他就会说：“兄弟，革命几年，还没有爱人，多么艰苦！哥哥给你介绍一个，你看如何？这个人是我老婆的同学，长得十分人材！”知道你和你妻子合不来，奸商也会来挑拨：“像老弟这样的人，应该找个称心如意的好太太；离了吧，再找不难，我帮忙！”看见你妻子不在身边，他就要给你“找个女朋友玩玩”，“保险找到，保险满意！”他可以雇一个妓女，说是他的表妹，介绍给你厮混。他可以把妓女叫到你房间里来。有的资本家甚至让自己的老婆亲自出马，公然无耻地说：“我有两个太太，到我家来玩吧！”有的大奸商牺牲自己的女儿去勾引国家企业机关的工作人员住旅馆。有的女奸商和娼妓无异，靠卖弄色相勾引干部，设立了大公司。
    他们会告诉你：“吃饭、跳舞、交际、应酬，这也是工作方法。大城市和乡下不一样，你不学会这一套还能工作？”“这是逢场作戏，何必认真？常在外边的人，谁也不那么干净。”“怕什么，换上便衣，不就没事了吗？”你仍然不愿上钩，他还会用另外的方式进攻：“你这个人真封建，这么不开通，亏你还是个老革命哩！”
    你终于失足了，染上了花柳病。你不敢到本机关的医务所看，也没有钱治；奸商看到你在为这事苦闷，就又来了：“你这病我负责治好，出多少钱算我的。”他领你去打针，吃药，就把你进一步拴到他的尾巴上了。
    　　“捧”你上天
    用以上这些办法都攻不动你，奸商还有恶毒的炮弹。他尽量捧你，把你奉承得迷三倒四，陷进他的迷魂阵里。见到年轻的干部就说：“这个同志，人真不错，年轻有为，做事能干！”看见你穿着呢子制服，就忙着给你点烟倒茶；又听到你说话是南方口音，就一个劲地恭维：“老革命，功劳真大，不简单，太不简单！”“你就像我的老上司，我跟着你一定有出路。”虽然你不过是个普通工作人员，他可以口口声声喊你“首长”。他们举行一个晚会邀请和他们有往来的干部参加；干部进门时他们就高喊：“头排二排是给首长们留的！”“全体起立，鼓掌欢迎！”奸商们对不久前已被处了死刑的大贪污犯宋德贵，不是就曾口口声声称“宋大人吗？”在骗了车皮运了木材之后，他们不是曾大摆筵席，开“庆祝采购木材胜利大会”（实际上是“庆祝偷盗、贪污胜利大会”），和宋德贵碰杯，高呼“宋处长万岁”吗？他们就是要把一些革命干部高高地捧入云霄直到把这些人摔下来，摔到他们的“宋大人”那样的下场！
    　大迂回
    “捧”仍然不行，奸商还有一套把戏：一本正经，摆出进步人士的面孔，“放长线，钓大鱼”，向革命干部采取大迂回的战术发动进攻。他们会说：“我也早就想参加革命，无奈家庭人口多，拖累得不行，不能不干这个营生。好在发展生产也是为人民服务。”他们会捏造一套身世：“我以前也是闹革命的，在正定三区当过区委；以后来石家庄做地下工作，丢掉了关系，才不得不做买卖糊口。”或者说：“老李，多年不见，我太落后了，以后多来我这里谈谈，帮助我学习进步吧！”他为了投合你的心意，脱下西装，换上了干部服。他尽量使你听得入耳，看得入目；他尽量装得进步、老实，骗得你的信任，使你麻痹起来，相信他没有恶意，和他发生感情；然后逐步深入，攻进你的心脏。“我这个收音机放着没用，你拿去吧，没事听听时事，可以帮助学习。”“艰苦是完全应该的，可是为人民服务，身体也是重要的，这些葡萄糖，你拿去补养补养吧！”绕了许多大圈子，归根结底，就又把你引到毁灭的路上去了。
    　　围攻
    单枪匹马的偷袭无效时，奸商们就布置下大规模的阵势。
    有些大奸商、最大的糖衣炮弹制造厂，是多方伪装起来的。他本人装得一本正经，俨然是最老实最开明的“实业家”。他的“基本字号”也比较规矩。但他却开了许多小厂小店，雇了一些人，或用他的亲戚做经理，专干非法的勾当，如果政府查出了，关门也不要紧。这样的大奸商永远也不出头露面，顶多叫他的儿子女儿出面活动，他在幕后操纵一切，指挥他的队伍向国家机关进攻。他甚至特别开设饭店，旅馆、舞场、“茶座”作为进攻的阵地。他指挥一群喽囉把革命干部包围起来。他们有的装红脸，有的装白脸，有的唱青衣，有的唱花旦，在你周围摆下阵势，使你终于做了俘虏。“一人上了钩，群贼来吃肉。”他们只要突破了一点，就通风报信，大群奸商向你轮番袭击，像一群苍蝇似地扑在你的身上、脸上，三番五次死缠磨。有的用半开玩笑半威胁的口吻说：“哪里都是交朋友，他们怎么对待你，我们也就怎样，买卖决不亏你。”“不照赵经理一个样，我可就要控告了！”他们还有更恶毒的办法，在一个机关攻开一个缺口之后，就要你介绍他们的人进去；打进去之后，就更便利地拉出来更多的人，又打进去更多的人；他们使不愿上钩的人受到讽刺、谩骂、打击、排挤，从内部向正派的干部展开围攻。最后，把一个机关完全变成资产阶级的机关。
    　流氓式的暗算
    奸商们具有大流氓所有的一切特点，他们会大耍无赖，讹诈欺骗，用阴险狠毒的办法暗算你。他们只要抓住你一点小辫子，你没有决心赶快剪掉辫子，就骑虎难下了。
    “我这个人好交朋友，今天咱哥儿俩去喝两杯！”你说不会喝酒，他说喝点啤酒没关系。喝着喝着他就掺上了烈性酒，直到把你灌醉。你醉了以后，他可以耍的花样就多了。他可以要你在不合理的合同上签字；可以拖你到不干不净的地方去。他还可以拿一百万元钞票塞在你口袋里，你发现了第二天要退还他，他马上变了脸：“我给你的是一千万！你还要假装正经，不受贿，那你就把一千万还我！”你和他喝过酒，大家都知道，你又拿不出一千万元来，只好上钩。他做的一件违法行为被查出要受罚时，他会苦苦央求你，说他一大家子人生活怎么困难，哭哭啼啼，引起你的同情。你暗地替他免了罚款之后，他就有了行贿的好机会：“你是我的救命恩人，我要报答你！”你不接受，他又可以翻脸：“我只好把上一次事情去向政府坦白，你看如何？”他先小小地行贿，要一个铁路人员偷卖给他一节车皮；第二次，他就要两节；第三次，他就要四节。你不敢答应了，他就说：“你不干，我就把咱们过去的事都‘兜露’出来。”
    他先用激将法故意奚落你，看不起你：“你看人家黄同志穿着呢子制服，多神气！你干了多年为什么还穿破棉袄？”“你一个老干部为什么还抽黄烟末？”“我们可要换坐头等车了。你是不是还是要按制度，坐三等硬席？”引起你的爱面子的虚荣心之后，他们就有机可乘了。一个老干部不满意自己的职位，奸商也会抓住加以利用：“你是个没文化的老粗，越往后越吃不开了。干了这些年还不是个小股员！咱们合伙开个铺子，总比你当这个小干部享福。”
    他们有的明目张胆地说：“我过去是个特务，我在公安局登记过了的。你如果不和我把那件事干下去，我就咬你一口，去报告你过去和我是同伙，你受得了？”
    奸商已经用他的圈套把你套紧了之后，事情闹大了的时候，他怕暴露，就用更狠的办法来摆布你。他会狠狠地把你的干部帽子摘下往地上一摔，威胁你最后再骗一笔款，完全脱离革命，和他携款潜逃。到半路，又把你撇下，他带上钱偷偷地溜了。
    　　一旦无用，一脚踢开
    当奸商需要你的时候，他们装出多么甜蜜蜜的笑脸：“用钱时尽管说话，到我家去拿，多少都行。在社会上做事还能不交朋友吗？多个朋友多一条路。”“自己兄弟，谁化谁的都没关系，你的就是我的，我的就是你的，咱这是共产主义，嘻嘻！”他甚至会酸溜溜地说：“交朋友要有诚心，交者不弃，弃者不交。”“老周，给我们好好干吧，如果公司开除你了，我养活你一辈子。别说你一个，十个八个也不算什么。如果你想娶老婆，咱们厂里六七十个女工随你挑。”到你真被开除了的时候，你对他没有用处了，他就会立即把你一脚踢开，你去哀求他他理也不理你。他过去亲热地给你找房子；你调动了工作岗位，对他没有什么帮助时，他就撵你马上搬家；甚至你妻子正在生孩子，他也不理会，“你在马路上养孩子我也管不着，马上给我腾开！”你要调到别处工作了，也不可能再帮助他了，他就要你马上“把账还清”，要你把过去受他的贿赂全给他“吐出来”，不然，“就告发你”。沈阳有一个受了贿赂的干部调到别处工作了，妻子还住在奸商家里；他感到这个干部对他没有用处了，就任意欺侮他的妻子，还造谣说“他在别处另找了对象，不要你了”。他逼她做娼妓，以至要强奸她。这个干部有把柄在奸商手里，知道了这些事也只能像哑叭吃了黄连。
    　　同志们，警惕啊！
    资产阶级就是这样向革命工作人员进行恶毒的进攻的。这些丑恶的事情，只不过是掀开资产阶级的“华贵”的帷幕的一角就看到的。而且有些实在太丑，我们甚至怕沾污了洁白的纸张，怕侮辱了读者的眼睛，不能都赤裸裸地展览在这里。
    对于这些事情，也许有人不敢相信，那么，你们随便找几个奸商去问问吧！可以问北京前“海通贸易公司”经理董建文，沈阳“鸿大行”经理周鸿恩，上海华星农具五金机厂经理孙达凯，石家庄慎记五金行经理吕清秀，长沙东亚营造厂经理苏旦，西安大通运输公司副经理张光甫；更可以问那个向六十三个机关一百零四个干部行贿的天津新华木行的大老板。或者随便问另外的那一个奸商都可以。他们应当可以给你指出他们做了这些勾当中的那一些。
    究竟什么是“糖衣炮弹”呢？以上就是一个简单的解剖图。
    资产阶级是有更丑恶、更无耻、更阴险、更狠毒的武器的。
    同志们，警惕啊！
