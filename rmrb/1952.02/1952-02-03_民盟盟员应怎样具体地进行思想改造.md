How Should Democratic League Members Specifically Conduct Ideological Remolding
China Democratic League Central Standing Committee Member Deng Chumin

By its nature, the China Democratic League is a New Democratic political party, a class alliance mainly composed of petty-bourgeois intellectuals; its task is to unite, educate, and remold the broad intellectual stratum. Therefore, the ideological remolding of Democratic League members is fundamentally the ideological remolding of intellectuals. Intellectuals are divided into upper, middle, and lower strata. Democratic League members should develop towards middle and lower-level intellectuals; however, the current membership is still predominantly upper-level intellectuals, especially in the upper leadership. Discussing the ideological state of upper-level intellectuals and their remolding is not simple. Almost everyone's thinking has its own system (that set cultivated for many years by higher education serving the past ruling class – worldview, outlook on life, science, technology, etc.), and is almost always influenced by old traditions.

The so-called old traditions include the feudal traditions of old China, and the traditions of European and American bourgeoisie and imperialism. Those who accept feudalist ideology often accept the reactionary, bad things that serve the feudal landlord class and personal selfish interests. They believe that only the things inherited from old China are good, and the older, the more lovable, and the more worthy of cherishing. Those who accept the ideological traditions of the European and American bourgeoisie and imperialism, the better ones have large groups of Montesquieu, Rousseau, and other ghosts following them, and the worse ones have large groups of Hitler, Mussolini, and other ghosts following them. This inevitably leads to either decaying old democracy, individualism, and liberalism, or brutal fascism in these people's minds. These thoughts are the root causes of anti-Soviet, anti-Communist, and anti-people sentiments, as well as pro-American, worship-American, and fear-American sentiments.

In addition to the above two very bad traditions (which are not mutually isolated but interconnected), there are some upper-level intellectuals who sympathize with, support, and participate in the New Democratic Revolution, accept the leadership of the Communist Party, and accept Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. They have played a role in promoting the revolution during the revolutionary movement; however, these progressive intellectuals are not truly Marxist-Leninist intellectuals. Therefore, in the fiery revolutionary movement, they sometimes show fanaticism and impatience; sometimes they show pessimism and disappointment. Especially after the national revolutionary victory, these people were invited and heavily used by the People's Government, and for a time were arrogant. Those engaged in philosophy proclaimed themselves Marxist-Leninist philosophers, those engaged in history proclaimed themselves Marxist-Leninist historians, and those engaged in politics and economics proclaimed themselves Marxist-Leninist political scientists and economists. They looked down on other democratic figures, those who did not understand Marxism-Leninism in the past but also contributed to the revolution, those who had old bourgeois democratic ideas, uncritically negated all the university professors in the old universities, and advocated that they should no longer be allowed to lecture. They even looked down on the worker-peasant cadres with lower cultural levels from the countryside, believing that the Party's united front leadership was too long, too broad, and too miscellaneous, and the united front was too "boundlessly broad." Therefore, when these people talked about ideological remolding and learning, they always thought they should be excluded. But what is the reality? When the call to resist US aggression and aid Korea was first raised, I don't know about others, but at least I wavered. When the criticism of "The Life of Wu Xun" first began, at least I wavered. Looking down on others, and arrogantly elevating oneself ideologically and politically is a very heavy burden. This is what people generally call the "progressive burden." If this burden is not resolutely discarded, it will not only hinder one's own progress but also hinder the general ideological remolding movement, and even hinder the People's Government's united front policy. Although these people are subjectively arrogant, in reality, they have only dabbled in a few Marxist-Leninist books. They only know how to vulgarize Marxism-Leninism, peddle words, and pretend to be profound. This is more dangerous than those who did not understand Marxism-Leninism in the past. This not only cannot help the study of Marxism-Leninism but may distort and confuse the essence of Marxism-Leninism (although subjectively this is not the case). Therefore, this heavy burden must not be carried anymore. If you are unwilling to part with your "love," progress will turn into backwardness, and correctness will turn into error.

Thus, all upper-level intellectuals must first devote themselves to this great movement of ideological remolding and learning. Learning the ideology of the working class, Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought, taking the ideology of the working class as the guiding ideology, eliminating the ideology of the reactionary classes, and gradually, steadily, and actively remolding the ideology of the peasant class, the petty-bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie, so as to raise one's own thinking to the ideological standard of the working class. Naturally, it is necessary to prevent "left" deviations, so as not to hinder the legitimacy required of these ideologies under realistic social conditions and their legitimate existence. But it is also necessary to prevent right deviations, and under the law of development where everything is changing, the world is changing, and history is changing, no legitimate thing should be allowed to permanently remain at a fixed stage and become immutable. The ideology of the working class, Marxism-Leninism, is the sole inheritor of all the excellent achievements of philosophy, science, and all culture in history. We must learn humbly in order to continuously improve ourselves and continuously approach the truth.

The most fundamental thing about the ideology of the working class, Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought is Marxist philosophy, the Marxist worldview, which is dialectical materialism. For us upper-level intellectuals to conduct ideological remolding with the ideology of the working class as the guiding ideology, the first thing (its beginning and starting point) is to transform our worldview, transforming various erroneous worldviews into the only correct worldview of the working class, communism, and fundamentally solve the problem.

Intellectuals (including all kinds of intellectuals, especially upper-level intellectuals – but excluding working-class intellectuals) have a philosophy and worldview of selling knowledge regardless of the object (under reactionary rule, most are happy to sell themselves to the reactionary rulers, helping and idling), on the one hand, flaunting academic supremacy and acting aloof, and on the other hand, coveting the reactionary factions' lewd, shameless, corrupt, and parasitic lives, and wholeheartedly wanting to climb up. They often cannot see the collective interests of society, the interests of the people, the interests of the exploited broad laborers, and the interests of all mankind. If one does not change one's worldview, one will not understand the present and future of our country and society, will not understand one's position in the country and society, and will not understand what should or should not be done, what can or cannot be done, so that one cannot faithfully serve the people's cause, but hinders the thorough realization of democratic reform and the gradual implementation of industrialization in our country in all aspects, and even leads to shameful phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. All of these are ideological problems, all because a correct worldview has not been fundamentally established. Therefore, I emphasize and propose the problem of transforming thought, first of all, as a problem of transforming the worldview.

The problem of transforming our worldview is the problem of transforming our stand, viewpoint, and method, which is to gradually transform various different stands, viewpoints, and methods into the stand, viewpoint, and method of the working class and Marxism-Leninism. But the change of thought is based on the change of practice. Therefore, we must throw ourselves into various fiery revolutionary struggles; participate in various political movements; stand at our work posts and carry out concrete practice; and understand and implement the policies and decrees of governments at all levels; especially, we must faithfully abide by the Common Program as the substantive national law. But this is only one side of what we have to do. And on the other side, in order to truly understand the policies and decrees, and achieve the goal of using theory to guide action, we must also seriously read Marxist-Leninist books, especially Mao Zedong Thought books that combine Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are unified, inseparable, integral, and systematic; we should not quote out of context or have a smattering of knowledge. Otherwise, the following phenomenon will inevitably occur: on the one hand, one acknowledges that "human thought seeks to be unblocked; when it cannot be unblocked, it changes; change leads to unblocking." On the other hand, one says, "As long as there is nothing unblocked in my chest, I will naturally continue to live." (This is the case with our Mr. Liang Shuming.) Also, "Some people think that since they agree with the Common Program and are willing to work for its realization, there is no need to emphasize communicating policy thoughts. This is incorrect. It should be known that we may not have fully understood the Common Program, and even our minds may still have some non-New Democratic and non-Common Program thoughts, such as the remnants of old democratic thoughts and even feudal thoughts, and therefore cannot correctly and comprehensively understand the Common Program." (Li Weihan: "Further Strengthening the United Front Work within Government Organs") Here, in essence, it is still because one cannot correctly and comprehensively understand Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and therefore cannot comprehensively and correctly understand the Common Program. Therefore, one must understand the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in thought, and then turn this theory into action, in order to stand firm on the Marxist-Leninist position, understand the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and method, and seek political and ideological consistency.

In the ideological remolding movement, there can be no illusions of peaceful remolding. This is just like there can be no illusions of peaceful reform in the land reform. The old things in our minds, the old philosophy, the old worldview – all idealism, prejudices, preconceptions, bad habits, feudal traditions, and the traditions of the European and American bourgeoisie and imperialism – are all spiritual whips that the reactionary rulers of the past held tightly in their hands to suppress the people and numb the people's consciousness; they themselves were accustomed to using this whip, and also cultivated a group of intellectuals to use this whip in their place. History proves that no reactionary ruling class and its servants – their intellectuals – has ever willingly given up this whip. Whether he is conscious or unconscious, once he is "preconceived," he will always "cling to the old and defend the deficiencies"; if he does not go through a fierce ideological struggle, ideological remolding cannot be completed. There are also people who still think this way: believing that since the national revolution has been victorious, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has been overthrown, the cultural and educational policies and the new school systems of major and minor schools have been promulgated, curriculum reforms, political studies, and ideological remolding study movements are being implemented and gradually unfolded, all kinds of intellectuals will naturally follow the government's policies and decrees in terms of ideological consciousness, gradually change, and reach the completion of ideological remolding peacefully without any self-education or self-transformation struggles. What is the reality? This is also an illusion. Everyone knows that there is resistance to the ideological remolding study movement, either open resistance or secret resistance. Even for the implementation of cultural and educational policies and decrees, there are bound to be some tricks, that is, some people, under the cover of carrying out the government's policies and decrees, perfunctorily and even obstruct the implementation of the government's policies and decrees. For example, once the Ministry of Education issues any instructions or directives, whether it is curriculum reform, a new school system, or a study movement, some people first implement it, first start it in the school, accept everything, and do everything, but everything is done incompletely, not seriously, and not as something they want to do, but only as something the government wants them to do. There are also individuals who have made painful self-criticism at study group meetings and have also written some self-criticism articles in newspapers; but it cannot be said that this has completed their ideological remolding. Whether a person's thought has been truly and thoroughly transformed depends on whether he has thoroughly abandoned his old thoughts and old viewpoints, and truly stood on the ideological position of the working class, and demonstrated it in actual actions. And to achieve such ideological remolding, it is necessary to go through fierce struggles, through a self-struggle of "declaring war on yesterday's self with today's self." In the fierce struggle, the old thoughts of the bourgeoisie, the petty-bourgeoisie, the peasant class, and other non-working-class thoughts in our minds are cleared out, and the thoughts of the working class, Marxism-Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought can be loaded in. We should not fantasize that a body full of rotten sores can be washed clean by gently wiping it with a towel (of course, this does not mean that ideological remolding should be carried out with crude methods, with methods of spanking and slapping hands, with methods that are not voluntary but forced, or treating the thoughts of our four friends as the thoughts of three enemies, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminating them, but only speaking of self-ideological struggle). The most effective weapon for this self-ideological struggle is criticism and self-criticism. Anyone who sincerely wants to carry out ideological remolding must truly and boldly use this weapon of criticism and self-criticism.

For the Democratic League to complete this great task of uniting, educating, and remolding the broad intellectual masses, and to unfold criticism and self-criticism, it must first strengthen our leading institutions and strengthen the ideological remolding of our leading components. Because strengthening ideological leadership and political leadership is extremely important in the ideological remolding study movement. If our leading institutions and leading components themselves are not sound, and cannot play a model role and take the lead, how can we talk about leading the ideological remolding study movement of the entire League? Therefore, we must frankly admit that our leadership work is not done well enough, and our own is not sound. We must first obtain the necessary ideological weapons ourselves, and then learn and master the ideology of the working class, that is, learn and master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, transform ourselves, transform the entire League, and transform society.

    民盟盟员应怎样具体地进行思想改造
    中国民主同盟  中央常务委员  邓初民
    中国民主同盟就其性质说，是以小资产阶级知识分子为主要成分的阶级联盟的新民主主义政党；它的任务是要团结教育和改造广大知识分子阶层。因此，民主同盟盟员的思想改造问题，基本上也就是知识分子的思想改造问题。知识分子有上、中、下层之分。中国民主同盟的盟员是应该向中、下层知识分子发展的；但目前的盟员成分还是上层知识分子占多数，尤其是上层领导部分。谈到上层知识分子的思想状况和它的改造问题，可就不简单了。每个人的思想几乎都有他自己的一套（从过去为统治阶级服务的高等教育所多年培养出来的——世界观、人生观、科学、技术等——那一套），差不多都受着旧传统的影响。
    所谓旧传统，一种是古旧中国的封建主义的传统，另一种是欧美资产阶级和帝国主义的传统。接受封建主义思想传统的人们，多半接受为封建地主阶级及为个人自私自利的企图服务的反动的坏东西。他们认为只有古旧的中国所遗传下来的东西是好的，而且愈古旧愈好、愈可爱、愈值得珍贵。接受欧美资产阶级帝国主义的思想传统的人们，好一点的就有一大群一大群孟德斯鸠、卢梭等等的幽灵跟着他，坏一点的就有一大群一大群希特勒、墨索里尼的幽灵跟着他。这样，必然使得这些人的脑子里，不是腐朽的旧民主主义、个人主义、自由主义，就是残暴的法西斯主义。这些思想，就是反苏、反共、反人民以及亲美、崇美、恐美等思想所以发生的根源。
    除了上述两种很坏的传统外（这两种传统不是互相孤立而是互相联系的），还有一些同情、拥护和参加新民主主义革命，接受共产党的领导和马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的上层知识分子。他们在革命运动中不是没有起过推进革命的作用；但这些进步知识分子，究竟不是真正马克思列宁主义的知识分子。所以在火热的革命运动中，有时表现出狂热、急躁；有时表现出悲观、失望。尤其是在全国革命胜利后，这些人被人民政府所邀请、所重用，一时趾高气扬。搞哲学的就自命为马克思列宁主义的哲学家，搞历史的就自命为马克思列宁主义的历史家，搞政治和经济的就自命为马克思列宁主义的政治学家、经济学家。他们看不起其他民主人士，看不起那些过去还不懂马克思列宁主义而对革命却也有过贡献的民主人士，看不起那些具有资产阶级旧民主思想的民主人士，无批判地否定一切旧大学里的大学教授，主张不应该再让他们走上讲坛。甚至看不起从农村来的党的文化水平较低的工农干部，大以为领导党的统一战线太长太广太杂，团结面过于“宽大无边”，因此，这些人一谈到思想改造学习，总以为自己应该除外。然而实际上怎样呢？当抗美援朝号召刚提出的时候，别人我不知道，起码我是动摇的。当“武训传”的批判初展开时，起码我也是动摇的。看不起人家，妄自尊大地在思想上、政治上抬高自己。这就是很沉重的包袱。这就是一般人所说的“进步包袱”。这个包袱不决心丢掉，不但阻碍了自己的进步，而且妨害着一般的思想改造运动，甚至妨害着人民政府的统一战线政策。这些人虽然主观上自高自大，实际上过去不过涉猎过几本马克思列宁主义书籍，他们只会把马克思列宁主义庸俗化，搬弄词句，故作高深。这样比过去根本还不懂马克思列宁主义的人反而有某些危险，这不仅不能帮助马克思列宁主义的学习，反而可能歪曲淆乱马克思列宁主义的精神实质（尽管主观上不是如此）。所以，这个沉重的包袱，决不能再背上了。如果不肯割“爱”，进步就变成落后，正确就变成错误。
    这样看，凡是上层知识分子，都必须首先投身于这一思想改造学习的大运动中。学习工人阶级思想，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，以工人阶级的思想为领导思想，肃清反动阶级的思想，把农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级的思想，逐步地稳步地而又积极地加以改造，以便把自己的思想提高到工人阶级的思想标准。这里自然要防止“左”的偏向，要不妨害这些思想在现实的社会条件下所要求于它的合法性及其合法存在。但也要防止右的偏向，在一切皆变，世界在变，历史在变的发展规律下，也不能让任何合法的东西永久停留在固定的阶段上而一成不变。工人阶级思想，马克思列宁主义是历史上所有一切哲学、科学即全部文化优良成果的唯一的继承者。我们必须虚心地学习，才能使自己不断地进步，不断地接近真理。
    工人阶级的思想，马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想最基本的东西，就是马克思主义的哲学，马克思主义的世界观，也就是辩证唯物论。我们上层知识分子要以工人阶级思想为领导思想而进行思想改造，首先（它的开始和下手处）就是要改造我们的世界观，把多种多样的错误的世界观改造成为工人阶级的共产主义的唯一正确的世界观，从根本上来解决问题。
    知识分子（包括各种知识分子，尤其是上层知识分子——但工人阶级知识分子除外）有出卖知识，不问对象（在反动统治下，大半乐于向反动统治卖身投靠，帮忙帮闲），一面标榜学术至上，自鸣清高，另一面却垂涎于反动派的荒淫无耻的腐朽的寄生生活，一心只想往上爬的哲学和世界观，他们往往看不见社会的集体利益、人民大众的利益、被剥削的广大劳动者的利益，以及全人类的利益。如果不改变自己的世界观，就不会了解我们国家社会的今天和明天，不会了解自己在国家社会中所占的地位，不了解什么是应当做的或不应当做的，什么是可以做的或不可以做的，以致不能忠实地服务于人民事业，而阻碍我国在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化，甚至发生了贪污、浪费、和官僚主义的可耻现象。所有这些都是一个思想问题，都是没有从根本上建立正确的世界观的缘故。所以，我把改造思想问题，首先看做一个改造世界观的问题加以强调提出。
    改造我们世界观的问题，就是改造我们立场、观点、方法的问题，就是要把各种不同的立场、观点、方法逐步改造成为工人阶级和马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法。可是思想的改变是以实践的改变为前提的。因此，我们就非投身于各种火热的革命斗争不可；非参加各种政治运动，站在自己工作岗位，进行具体的实践不可；也非了解和推行各级人民政府的政策、法令不可；尤其是非把共同纲领当做实质的国家法来忠实遵守不可。但这只是我们所要做的事情的一面。而其另一面，要达到真正了解政策、法令，拿理论来指导行动的目的，就还必须认真地阅读马克思列宁主义的书籍，尤其是要认真地阅读把马克思列宁主义跟中国革命的具体实践相结合的毛泽东思想的书籍。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想本身是统一的、不可分的、整体的、有系统的；我们不应该寻章摘句，一知半解。否则，就必然会有这样的现象发生：在一方面承认了“人的思想是求通的；通不下去，才变；变则通”。在另一方面又说“只须在我胸中没有什么不通的，自然依旧活下去”。（我们的梁漱溟先生就是如此。）还有，“有人以为自己既赞同共同纲领并又愿为其实现而努力，就无需强调沟通政策思想了，这是不正确的。要知道，我们对共同纲领不一定已经都懂得了，甚至自己的脑筋中可能还有某些非新民主主义的、非共同纲领的思想，例如旧民主主义的思想以至封建主义思想的残余，因而不能正确地和全面地理解共同纲领。”（李维汉：“进一步加强政府机关内部的统一战线工作”）这里，本质上还是因为不能正确地全面地理解马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，因此不能全面地正确地理解共同纲领。所以必须在思想上懂得了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基本理论，又把这个理论变为行动，才能站稳马克思列宁主义的立场，了解马克思列宁主义的观点、方法，求得政治上和思想上的一致。
    在思想改造运动中，是不能有和平改造的任何幻想的。这正如在土地改革中不能有和平改革的幻想一样。我们脑筋里的一套旧东西，旧的哲学，旧的世界观——一切唯心论、偏见、成见、恶习，封建主义的传统，欧美资产阶级和帝国主义的传统，这些都是过去反动统治者手中紧紧握着的为着镇压人民、麻醉人民意识的一条精神上的鞭子；他们自己惯于使用这条鞭子，同时也培养一批知识分子来代替他们使用这条鞭子。历史证明，任何反动统治阶级及其仆从们——他们的知识分子，也决没有一个是自愿放弃这条鞭子的。不管他是自觉的或不自觉的，既经“先入为主”，他总要“抱残守缺”；如果不经过一场激烈的思想斗争，思想改造也是不能完成的。现在也有人还这样想：以为全国革命既经胜利，蒋匪帮既经打倒，文化教育政策、各大中小学的新学制既经颁行，课程改革、政治学习、思想改造的学习运动等等正在实施和逐步展开，各种知识分子，在思想意识方面，也自然会遵循政府的政策法令，逐步改变，用不着什么自我教育、自我改造的斗争，就会和平地达到思想改造的完成。事实怎样呢？这也是幻想。大家知道：对于思想改造的学习运动，不是没有抗拒的，或者明抗，或者暗抗。即令对于文化教育政策法令的执行，也不免要有一些花样，即某些人在奉行政府的政策法令的掩盖之下，来敷衍甚至阻碍政府的政策法令的贯彻。例如教育部有什么指示或指令一经颁行，不管是课程改革也好，新学制也好，学习运动也好，某些人都首先奉行，首先在学校里面搞起来，样样都接受，样样都搞，可是样样都搞得不彻底、不认真，不把它当作自己要做的事来做，而只是把它当作政府要他做的事来做。还有个别的人在学习小组会上，也来了一番沉痛的自我检讨，在报纸上也写了一些自我批评的文章；但也不能说这就完成了自己的思想改造。一个人的思想是否得到了真正的彻底的改造，是要看他是否彻底地抛弃了旧的思想、旧的观点，而真正地站到工人阶级的思想立场上来，并在实际行动中表现出来。而要做到这样的思想改造，就必须要经过激烈的斗争，经过“以今日之我与昨日之我宣战”的自我斗争。在激烈的斗争中把我们脑子里的资产阶级、小资产阶级、农民阶级以及其他非工人阶级的旧思想清除出去，工人阶级的思想、马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想才能装进来。我们不要幻想满身的烂疮疤，只要轻轻地用手巾擦一擦，就可洗清它（当然这也并不是说思想改造要用粗暴的方法，要用打屁股和打手心的办法，要用不是出于自觉自愿而是强迫的办法来进行，或把我们四个朋友的思想、都当作三个敌人的思想，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地肃清，而只是说的自我思想斗争）。这一自我思想斗争最有效的武器，就是批评和自我批评。凡是诚心要进行思想改造的人，就要真正地大胆地运用这一批评和自我批评的武器。
    民主同盟要完成团结教育和改造广大知识分子的这一伟大任务，要展开批评和自我批评，首先就要加强我们的领导机构，加强我们领导成分的思想改造。因为，加强思想领导、政治领导，在思想改造的学习运动中是异常重要的。如果我们领导机构和领导成分本身都不健全，都不能起示范作用和带头作用，怎么谈得上来领导全盟的思想改造的学习运动呢？所以我们必须坦白承认我们的领导工作，是作得不够的，我们的本身是不健全的。我们必须首先使自己得到必须的思想武器，然后才能进而学习和掌握工人阶级的思想，也就是学习和掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，改造自己，改造全盟，改造社会。
