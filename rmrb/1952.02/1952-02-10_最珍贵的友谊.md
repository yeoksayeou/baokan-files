    The Most Precious Friendship
    Kang Tuo
    Every single thing I saw in the Soviet Union will be etched in my memory forever. But I want to write about the friendship between China and the Soviet Union, yet I find it particularly difficult. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, even the smallest thing, I feel is very difficult to express its full meaning. Because this friendship is so deep and great, this friendship is the most precious thing in the world.
    On November 7th last year, in Red Square in Moscow, the hundreds of thousands of marching people gave us Chinese such great honor! They held up thousands upon thousands of portraits of Chairman Mao, holding high and large Chinese flags and maps. Everyone kept waving their arms at us, jumping up and shouting, "Long live the great Chinese people!" "Mao Zedong! Hurrah!" The flowers they threw at us piled up high, some were so excited they forgot the marching route, wanting to rush over and shake our hands... In front of the red star that illuminates the globe, the respect our Chinese people received, who can express the full and profound meaning in words!
    And in every place in the Soviet Union, we encountered scenes like Red Square. We met second-grade elementary school students proudly saying:
    "I haven't learned geography yet, but I know China, I know a lot about China!" In a kindergarten in Moscow, we met four-year-old children who asked us to send their regards to the four-year-old children in China. In the home of Gadzhiyev in the Tsaitkin Collective Farm in Azerbaijan, we saw photos of famous generals of our People's Liberation Army pasted on the wall; in Tbilisi, we met the most famous actress in the Georgian Republic, who boasted to us that the fabric she was wearing was from Beijing. Also in the city of Kirovabad, a city that had never seen Chinese people, the headmistress of the middle school there said to us: "As soon as I hear about China, I am so excited that I can't speak!" In great Stalingrad, the worker Troshini, who won the Order of Lenin, told us: "Whenever I see Zhou Enlai's statement saying: 'I represent 475 million Chinese people...' I feel my whole body filled with strength!" The great poet of Azerbaijani national history, Lisami, eight hundred years ago, in his immortal epic "Seven Beauties," wrote about a Chinese beauty, praising the bravery, diligence, intelligence, and beauty of the Chinese people and Chinese women. The people and writers of this nation feel particularly proud and honored because of this. The novelist Cheishvili, who won the Stalin Prize, told us about this experience: In 1930, when he participated in the agricultural collectivization work in the Kakheti region of Lagodekhi district in the Georgian Republic, he met an illiterate old farmer who sang a beautiful poem about Chinese farmers, which he composed and sang himself while playing an instrument. The old man sang about the miserable life of Chinese farmers under feudal oppression, revealing deep sympathy, and later sang about Chinese farmers struggling under the leadership of the Communist Party and would soon be liberated. At this time, the old farmer's tone was filled with restrained excitement and hope for a beautiful ideal. These are just many scattered and small events, but each of them deeply depicts the most precious friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, deeply encouraging all peace-loving people to move forward bravely!
    We are able to receive such immeasurable glory because of Chairman Mao, because of our people's glorious and splendid struggle history, and because of our motherland's contributions in resisting America and aiding Korea and in production and construction. The famous Soviet writer Kadayev repeatedly told us: "We should translate more Chinese works! Considering the current rich and great situation in China, every Soviet person should have their own books and works about China on their bookshelf!" And when we visited the oil extraction project on Artem Island in Baku, the two or three hundred local residents suddenly automatically surrounded us, cheering and paying tribute to us. Pannakhov, the secretary of the local Party District Committee, immediately addressed the crowd, saying: "Our district is a very small district in the Soviet Union, and they came here because of the importance attached to them by the representatives of the Chinese people. The Chinese People's Volunteers are now shedding blood on the Korean front for the cause of peace! We should create new achievements in production and contribute more to peace together with the Chinese People's Volunteers!" A few short words aroused a tidal wave of response, and also moved me to tears.
    But our victory is inseparable from the name of Stalin and the socialist people. I remember the scene of our people sending cheers to Stalin in front of Tiananmen Square in Beijing on October 1st; I remember the scene of us excitedly discussing and learning every new experience of Soviet construction; and I also remember ten years ago, in the difficult years of our War of Resistance Against Japan, we regarded every victory of the Soviet Patriotic War as our own victory. Whenever we mention the Soviet Union, we are so excited! Just like the Soviet people gave us, we have always given our Soviet friends the utmost respect and sincerity. The friendship between our two great countries is truly precious beyond everything, and our friendship will develop and consolidate day by day with common efforts! The cause of defending world peace based on the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people will surely be victorious!

    最珍贵的友谊
    康濯
    我在苏联看到的每一件事物，都将使我长记心头。但我想写一点关于中苏友谊的事情，却感到特殊的困难。中苏人民之间的友谊，那怕是最微小的一件事，我都觉着很不容易说出它的全部意义来。因为这种友谊是那样地深厚和伟大，这种友谊，是世界上第一等的最珍贵的东西。
    在去年十一月七日，在莫斯科的红场，那几十万游行的群众，给予我们中国的是多么大的光荣！他们举着千千万万的毛主席像，举着又高又大的中国的国旗和地图。他们每一个都不停地向我们挥着手臂，都跳起来对我们直喊：“伟大的中国人民万岁！”“毛泽东！乌拉！”他们扔给我们的花朵堆得老高，他们有的竟激动得忘了游行的路线，要冲过来跟我们握手……在那照亮全球的宝石的红星前面，我们中国人民受到的尊敬，谁能用言语说出那全部的深远的意义啊！
    而在苏联的每一个地方，我们也碰到如同红场一样的情景。我们碰见二年级的小学生骄傲地说着：
    “我还没学地理，可是我知道中国，知道很多中国的事情！”我们在莫斯科的幼稚园，碰见那四岁的儿童，托我们向中国的四岁的小朋友致敬。在阿塞拜疆蔡特金集体农庄加吉耶夫的家里，看见墙头上贴着我们人民解放军的有名的将领的照片；在第比利斯，碰见格鲁吉亚共和国最有名的女演员，向我们夸耀她穿的料子是北京的。还有在基罗瓦巴德城，那是个从没见过中国人的城市，那里的中学女校长对我们说：“我一听到中国，就激动得说不出话来！”在伟大的斯大林格勒，获得列宁勋章的工人特洛希尼告诉我们：“我每当看到周恩来声明里边说：‘我代表四亿七千五百万中国人民……’我就觉着全身充满力量！”阿塞拜疆民族历史上的伟大诗人立萨米，在八百年前，在他不朽的长诗“七个美女”里面，写了一个中国美女，尽情地歌颂了中国人民和中国妇女的勇敢、勤劳、聪明和美丽。这个民族的人民和作家，因为这而感到特别的骄傲和光荣。曾经获得斯大林奖金的小说家切依什维里，告诉过我们这样一段经历：一九三○年，他在格鲁吉亚共和国拉戈德克斯区的戛赫吉亚地方，参加农业集体化工作的时候，碰到过一个不识字的老农民，自弹自编自唱，唱出了一首关于中国农民的幽美的诗歌。老者唱到中国农民在封建压迫下过着的悲惨的生活，流露着极深厚的同情，后来唱到中国农民正在共产党的领导下进行斗争，不久一定会要解放，这时候，老农民的音调里，充满着抑制不住的激奋和对于美丽的理想的希望。这不过是许许多多零星的微小的事件，然而，这里的每一件，都深深地刻划着中苏人民的最珍贵的友谊，深深地鼓舞着一切爱好和平的人民勇敢向前！
    我们能够得到这样无量的光荣，是因为毛主席，因为我们人民的光辉灿烂的斗争历史，因为我们祖国在抗美援朝和生产建设上的功劳。苏联的名作家卡达耶夫曾经再三地对我们说过：“我们是应该更多地翻译中国的作品啊！从目前中国那样丰富而伟大的情况来说，我们每一个苏联人的书架上，无论如何是都应该有自己的关于中国的书籍和中国的作品呀！”而当我们在巴库的阿尔蕉牟岛上参观采油工程以后，当地的二三百居民，忽然自动地把我们包围，向我们欢呼致敬。当地党的区委书记潘纳霍夫，马上面对人群讲话，他说：“我们这里是苏联很小的一个区，由于中国人民代表的重视，他们才来到这里。中国人民的志愿军，现在正在朝鲜前线为和平事业而流血！我们应该在生产上创造更新的成绩，和中国志愿军一道，为和平贡献更多的力量！”短短的几句话，激起了狂潮般的响应，也激动得我的眼里流出热泪来。
    但我们的胜利，是和斯大林的名字、和社会主义的人民分不开的。我记得在十月一日的北京天安门前，我们人民把欢呼送给斯大林的情景；记得我们兴奋地谈论着和学习着苏联建设的每一个新的经验的情景；也记得在十年以前，在我们抗日战争的艰苦的年代，我们把苏联卫国战争的每一个胜利，当作自己的胜利的情景。一提起苏联，我们是那样地激动！如同苏联人民给予我们的一样，我们从来也就是把头等的尊敬，真诚地送给我们的苏联友人。我们两个伟大国家的友谊真是超越一切地珍贵，而我们的友谊更将随着共同的努力日益发展和巩固！以中苏人民的伟大友谊为基础的保卫世界和平的事业，是一定会胜利的！
