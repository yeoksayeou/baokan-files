    Unscrupulous Merchant Jia Shaotang Bribes Cadres to Cut Corners
    Editor: Jia Shaotang, manager of the Beijing Daxing Iron Factory, bribed Mi Yuzhen, a technician from a certain department of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, in order to steal state property. Jia Shaotang said to Mi Yuzhen, "Your life is very hard, I want to help you as a friend." Then, he gave Mi Yuzhen two million yuan in the form of a "loan." In this way, he undertook many projects through Mi Yuzhen, cutting corners and seizing exorbitant profits. For example, in the tap water pipe project of a certain department, he used old pipes instead of new pipes, gaining an exorbitant profit of 40 million yuan. Although Mi Yuzhen discovered this situation, he turned a blind eye because he had accepted a bribe. In the dormitory sanitary sewer project of a certain department, he did not construct according to the design drawings, and gained another 20 million yuan, which he and Mi Yuzhen split equally. The materials he transported to the construction site did not match the receipts, such as the curved beams and steel bars, which differed greatly. He also welded low-quality elbows in an attempt to deceive. Mi Yuzhen received a total of 12 million yuan in bribes, but this caused a loss of at least 400 million yuan to the state.

    奸商贾绍棠贿赂干部偷工减料
    编辑同志：北京大兴铁工厂经理贾绍棠，为了盗窃国家财产，就向人民革命军事委员会某部技师米毓珍行贿。贾绍棠对米毓珍说：“你们的生活很苦，我要尽朋友的力量来帮助你。”接着，他就用“借”的方式送给米毓珍二百万元。这样，他通过米毓珍承做了很多工程，进行偷工减料、攫取暴利的勾当。比如：在某部的自来水管子工程里，他用旧管子代替新管子，得到暴利四千万元。米毓珍虽然发现这种情形，但因已受了贿赂，就不闻不问。在某部的宿舍卫生水道工程里，他不按设计的图样施工，又多得了二千万元，他和米毓珍平分了。他运到工地的材料和单据不符，如弯梁、铁筋等都相差很多。他还把质量很次的弯头焊好，企图蒙蔽。米毓珍前后共得贿赂金一千二百万元，但因此给国家造成的损失至少有四亿元。    葛存龄
