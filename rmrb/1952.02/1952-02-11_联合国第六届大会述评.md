    Commentary on the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly

    The Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, which opened on November 6th of last year at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, concluded on February 5th after a full three months of meetings. The United States originally tried hard to use this session of the General Assembly to make up for the loopholes in its war policy, which was running into snags everywhere, but as a result suffered a series of serious setbacks. The progress of this session of the General Assembly powerfully confirmed the defeat of the U.S. war policy throughout the world, and at the same time exposed the increasing intensification of internal and external contradictions in the imperialist camp.

    This session of the General Assembly was convened under the situation that the U.S. war policy was falling into a deep crisis on a global scale. The disastrous defeat of the U.S. aggressors in Korea, the vigorous development of the national liberation movements in Asia and North Africa, the continuous strengthening of the peace movement sweeping the world, and the sharp intensification of contradictions within the North Atlantic aggressive bloc under the policy of large-scale arms expansion and war preparation - all of this made the U.S. ruling group extremely alarmed. It was under these circumstances that the U.S. State Department painstakingly drafted a set of insidious political conspiracies and brought them to this session of the General Assembly, attempting to start up its majority voting machine in the United Nations and obtain some "political capital" that could be used to continue its war plan.

    Because the United States saw the strong emotions of people all over the world demanding peace and opposing arms expansion and war preparations, it dared not appear openly as a war provocateur with fangs and claws as it had done in the previous session of the General Assembly. Therefore, it first put forward a fake peace plan to cover up its fanatical arms expansion and war preparations - the false disarmament plan of the United States, Britain, and France, attempting to deceive world opinion. Secondly, the United States released two running dogs, the Kuomintang remnants and the Tito bandit gang, attempting to confuse the world's people by slandering the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. After spreading these two layers of smoke, the United States finally wanted to force the General Assembly to accept its core plan - the so-called "collective measures" plan. This plan was a further development of the resolution forced by the United States through the Fifth General Assembly to transform the United Nations into a tool of war, and it wanted to turn the United Nations into a subsidiary body of the North Atlantic War Alliance in fact.

    However, although the U.S. delegation used all means of coercion and inducement, it failed to achieve its goal. The United States suffered a serious moral and political defeat.

    The false peace proposals of the United States, Britain, and France were discussed in the Political Committee of the General Assembly for a full month. The deceptive conspiracies of the United States, Britain, and France were thoroughly exposed by the Soviet Union and other countries. Under pressure from the majority of delegations, they were forced to hold a four-nation sub-committee with the Soviet Union to study disarmament proposals. The stubborn attitude of the United States in the sub-committee further exposed its criminal attempt to obstruct disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Even U.S. newspapers admitted that the efforts of the U.S. delegation to cover up the U.S. aggressive policy had failed.

    The disgusting slanders of the Kuomintang remnants and the Tito bandit gang also suffered a shameful failure. The Soviet Union's proposal to accuse the United States of carrying out subversive and sabotage activities against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, however, won the support of world opinion. Even a French bourgeois newspaper like "Paris News" believed that the discussion of this proposal by the General Assembly had become "an interrogation of the United States."

    As for the main conspiracy of the United States in this session of the General Assembly - the so-called "collective measures" plan to force countries to provide cannon fodder for the U.S. aggressors to drive, it suffered a complete failure. Only a few countries in the U.S.-British group supported the U.S. plan. It was unanimously resisted by Arab countries, Southeast Asian countries, and some Latin American countries. The amendments proposed by these countries were finally adopted by the General Assembly, which actually completely overturned the entire concept of the so-called "collective measures." Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky pointed out: The United States was forced to retreat in a complete and embarrassing rout on this issue.

    The United States not only failed to realize its pre-arranged plans, but also suffered repeated setbacks on many other issues. For example, on the issue of electing non-permanent members of the Security Council, although the United States tried desperately to pull Greece into the Security Council as its echo, it was only with difficulty that Greece was "elected" on the nineteenth ballot. In the previous eighteen ballots, the United States suffered defeat time and time again.

    Faced with the shocking defeats of the United States in this session of the General Assembly, the U.S. delegation, which had always regarded the United Nations as a stamp-approving organ for its aggressive measures, developed a feeling of fear of submitting issues to the General Assembly for discussion that had never existed in the past. The United States had ferociously manipulated the Fifth General Assembly to pass bloody proposals that facilitated its expansion of aggression in Korea. At the beginning of this session of the General Assembly, the United States also requested that the Korean issue be included in the agenda. However, later seeing that many countries in the U.S.-British group were dissatisfied with the U.S.'s arbitrary delay in the Korean armistice negotiations, it finally had to hurriedly come forward and propose postponing the discussion of the Korean issue and desperately obstruct this session of the General Assembly from discussing the Korean issue.

    The series of serious failures of the United States in this session of the General Assembly, and the uneasy mood of the U.S. delegation in this session of the General Assembly, are of great significance. It shows that there are fewer and fewer countries willing to be buried with the United States, which is rushing headlong on the road of aggression to its own destruction. From the voting records of this session of the General Assembly, it can be seen that a quarter to a half of the United Nations member states in the U.S.-British majority often refuse to follow the leadership of the United States. "Rebellion" first came from Arab countries and Southeast Asian countries. Under the increasingly high tide of the national liberation movement in Asia and North Africa, the representatives of these countries' governments not only refused to support the United States in the voting on many important issues, but also spoke sharply criticizing the conspiracies of the United States, Britain, and France and other colonial countries. At this session of the General Assembly, when the colonial countries obstructed the General Assembly from discussing the issue of Morocco, and when discussing the issue of Palestine, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France were fiercely opposed by the representatives of these countries. At the same time, "rebellion" also appeared in the Latin American countries that the United States has always controlled most strictly. On many important issues, there are always some Latin American countries' representatives who refuse to support the U.S.'s proposals. According to the French "National Forum" weekly, U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations Austin was very alarmed by this "rebellion" phenomenon in the United Nations. In his report to U.S. Secretary of State Acheson during the conference, he said that the prestige of the United States was declining sharply, and even some Latin American countries' delegations were breaking away from U.S. control. At the close of the conference, United Press International telegraphed from Paris: "Many representatives believe that the increasing unwillingness of small countries to blindly follow the United States is the most important trend in this session of the General Assembly."

    During this session of the General Assembly, Soviet delegation leader Vyshinsky pointed out this important trend, saying: "Even what is happening at this session of the General Assembly shows that the United States, the U.S. government, and the U.S. monopoly capitalists' use of pressure on some countries is gradually failing. These countries are increasingly aware of the unbearable burden of U.S. oppression, and are beginning to protest and fight against this oppression by all means within their power." Vyshinsky also pointed out: There was originally a core headed by the United States in the United Nations that did not want peace, so the ruling groups of the United States, Britain, and France have always been able to handle problems at will in the United Nations. However, in this session of the General Assembly, this core has split. Now some people are beginning to resist the U.S. war plan, although so far it is still a "kneeling resistance," but it is resistance after all.

    Under the manipulation of the United States, this session of the General Assembly failed to realize the expectations of the people of the world and pass any decisions that could truly strengthen world peace and security, stop the expansion of armaments, and ease international tensions. The General Assembly even rejected the extremely important peace proposals put forward by the Soviet Union. However, despite this, the United States could not prevent the growing influence of the Soviet Union in the United Nations. The Soviet Union's peace proposals and the speeches of the Soviet representatives were the focus of attention throughout this session of the General Assembly. The Soviet Union's peace proposals have won the support of many delegations within the United Nations, and the unanimous support of the people of the world outside the United Nations. Agence France-Presse revealed in a telegram from Paris on December 13th of last year: "A broad movement first led by India and Middle Eastern countries in the United Nations is gaining momentum steadily... This movement has now even spread to Pan-American countries... Today it seems that this movement is leaning towards the Soviet bloc."

    The results of the Sixth Session of the United Nations General Assembly have made the U.S. ruling group, which is running into snags everywhere, even more frustrated and worried. United Press International Paris February 4th news sadly sighed: This session of the General Assembly was "the most disappointing session in history."

    The trend of the increasing isolation of the United States and the increasing influence of the Soviet Union in this session of the General Assembly is also the fundamental trend in the current international situation. In the evolution of the current international situation, the balance of world forces is rapidly changing in the direction of being conducive to the forces of peace. The forces of peace, headed by the Soviet Union, which are already much stronger than the forces of war, are constantly growing stronger, while the forces of war, headed by U.S. imperialism, are falling into an increasingly deep crisis.

    联合国第六届大会述评
    去年十一月六日在巴黎夏乐宫揭幕的联合国第六届大会，经过整整三个月的会议以后，已在二月五日闭幕。美国原来竭力企图利用这届大会来为它处处碰壁的战争政策弥补漏洞，但是结果遭到一连串的严重挫败。这届大会的进程，有力地证实了美国的战争政策在全世界败北，同时暴露了帝国主义阵营内外矛盾日益加深。
    这届大会是在美国战争政策在全世界范围内陷入深重危机的形势下召开的。美国侵略者在朝鲜的惨重失败，亚洲和北非殖民地民族解放运动的蓬勃开展，席卷全世界的和平运动的不断壮大，以及在大规模扩军备战政策下，北大西洋侵略集团内部矛盾的急剧尖锐化——所有这一切，使得美国统治集团极其惊慌。正是在这种情况下，美国国务院费尽心机地草拟了一套阴险的政治阴谋，带到本届大会上，企图开动它在联合国中的多数表决机器，谋取一些能借以继续推行其战争计划的“政治资本”。
    美国因为看到全世界人民要求和平、反对扩军备战的强烈情绪，这次已不敢再像在前一届大会上一样张牙舞爪地公开以战争挑拨者的面目出现，因此，首先提出了掩饰它狂热扩军备战的假和平计划——美、英、法三国假的裁减军备计划，企图对全世界舆论进行欺骗。其次，美国又放出国民党残匪和铁托匪帮两条走狗，妄图以诬蔑苏联和人民民主国家来混淆全世界人民的视听。在散布出这两重烟幕以后，美国最后就想迫使大会接受它的核心计划——所谓“集体措施”计划，这个计划是美国强迫第五届大会通过的变联合国为战争工具的决议的进
    一步发展，它想在事实上把联合国变成北大西洋战争联盟的附属机构。
    但是，虽然美国代表团用尽了一切威逼利诱的手段，它并没有能达到自己的目的。美国在道义上和政治上都遭到了严重的失败。
    美、英、法三国的假和平建议，在大会政治委员会中讨论了整整一个月。美、英、法三国的欺骗阴谋受到苏联和其他国家的彻底揭露。它们在多数代表团的压力下，被迫不得不和苏联举行了研究裁军建议的四国小组委员会。美国在小组委员会中的顽固态度更加暴露了它竭力阻挠裁减军备和禁止原子武器的罪恶面目。甚至美国报纸都承认美国代表团企图掩饰美国侵略政策的努力是失败了。
    国民党残匪和铁托匪帮令人作呕的诽谤谰言也遭到可耻的失败。而苏联控诉美国对苏联和人民民主国家进行颠覆和破坏活动的提案，却获得了全世界舆论的支持，连“巴黎新闻”这样的法国资产阶级报纸也认为大会对这一提案的讨论，已成为“对美国的审讯”。
    至于美国在这届大会中的主要阴谋——强迫各国提供炮灰供美国侵略者驱使的所谓“集体措施”计划，更是遭到了彻底的失败。在美英集团中只有寥寥几个国家支持美国的计划。它遭到了阿拉伯国家、东南亚国家和某些拉丁美洲国家的一致反抗。大会最后通过了这些国家所提出的修正案，实际上已把所谓“集体措施”的整个概念完全推翻。苏联代表团团长维辛斯基指出：美国在这个问题上被迫从全线狼狈败退。
    美国不仅在实现事先经过周密布置的计划方面落了空，而且在其他许多问题上也一再遭受挫折。例如，在选举安全理事会非常任理事国问题上，美国虽然拚命设法把希腊拉进安全理事会做它的应声虫，但是直到大会进行到第十九次表决时才勉强把希腊“选出”来，而在以前的十八次表决中，美国
    一次又一次地遭受失败。
    面对着美国在这届大会中触目惊心的败绩，一向把联合国看作是它的侵略措施的盖印机关的美国代表团，产生了过去从来没有的害怕把问题提交大会讨论的心情。美国曾经穷凶极恶地操纵第五届大会通过便利其扩大侵略朝鲜的血腥提案，在本届大会之初美国还要求把朝鲜问题列入议程，但是后来看到美英集团许多国家不满美国独断独行地在朝鲜停战谈判中采取拖延态度，最后竟不得不慌张地自行出面建议延期讨论朝鲜问题，并拚命阻挠本届大会讨论朝鲜问题。
    美国在本届大会上一连串的严重失败，以及美国代表团在本届大会上惶惶不安的心情，是具有重大意义的。它表明：愿意替在侵略道路上狂奔冒进自取灭亡的美国做殉葬者的国家已经越来越少了。从本届大会的投票纪录中可以看到，美英多数中已常常有四分之一到二分之一的联合国会员国拒绝追随美国的领导。“反叛”首先来自阿拉伯国家和东南亚国家。在亚洲和北非民族解放运动日益高涨的形势下，这些国家政府的代表不仅在许多重要问题的表决中拒绝支持美国，而且发言尖锐抨击美、英、法各殖民国家的阴谋。本届大会上，在殖民国家阻挠大会讨论摩洛哥问题时，在讨论巴勒斯坦问题时，美、英、法三国代表都遭到这些国家代表的猛烈反对。同时，“反叛”也出现在美国一贯控制得最严密的拉丁美洲国家中。在许多重要问题上，总有若干拉丁美洲国家代表拒绝支持美国的主张。据法国
    “民族论坛”周刊报道，美国常驻联合国代表奥斯汀对联合国中这种“反叛”现象十分惊慌，他在大会期间给美国国务卿艾奇逊的报告中说，美国的威信正在急剧下降，甚至一些拉丁美洲国家的代表团也正在脱离美国的控制。在大会闭幕时，合众社从巴黎发出的电讯说：“许多代表认为小国越来越不愿盲目地追随美国，是本届大会上最重要的一个趋向。”
    在本届大会期间，苏联代表团团长维辛斯基曾指出这种重要趋向说：“甚至本届大会上正在发生的事情也表明：美国、美国政府、美国垄断资本家对一些国家施用压力，渐渐不灵了。这些国家愈来愈了解难以忍受的美国压迫的重负，正在开始用力所能及的各种方法，对这种压迫提出抗议，进行斗争。”维辛斯基又指出：联合国中本来有一个以美国为首的不希望和平的核心，因此美国、英国和法国的统治集团在联合国中一向可以随心所欲地处理问题。但是，在这届大会上，这个核心分裂了。现在有人开始反抗美国的战争计划了，尽管到现在为止还是“跪着的反抗”，但毕竟是反抗。
    在美国的操纵下，本届大会并没有能够实现全世界人民的期望而通过任何能真正加强世界和平与安全、停止扩张军备及缓和国际紧张局势的决定。大会竟然否决了苏联所提出的极重要的和平提案。但是，尽管如此，美国却无法阻止苏联在联合国中的影响日趋扩大。苏联的和平提案和苏联代表的发言，在这届大会中自始至终是各方注意的焦点。苏联的和平提案在联合国内获得了许多代表团的支持，而在联合国外获得了全世界人民的同声拥护。法新社在去年十二月十三日从巴黎发出的电讯中曾透露：“联合国中最先由印度和中东国家带头的一个广泛的运动正在稳步得势。……这个运动现在甚至已经蔓延到泛美国家。……今天看来这个运动是倒向苏联集团的。”
    联合国第六届大会的结果，使得处处碰壁的美国统治集团更加沮丧而忧虑。合众社巴黎二月四日消息黯然慨叹：这届大会是“历史上最令人失望的一届大会”。
    本届大会中美国处境日益孤立、苏联影响日益扩大的趋向，也正是当前国际形势中的根本趋向。在当前国际形势的演变中，世界力量的对比正迅速朝着有利于和平力量的方向变化，已经大大强于战争力量的以苏联为首的和平力量正在不断壮大，而以美帝国主义为首的战争力量正陷入愈来愈深重的危机。（新华社）
