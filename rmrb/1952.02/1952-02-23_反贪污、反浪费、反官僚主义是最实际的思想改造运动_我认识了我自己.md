    Combating Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy is the Most Practical Ideological Remolding Movement – I Know Myself
    Yang Renpian, Professor, Department of History, Peking University

    In the previous stage of the teachers' study movement, I realized that only by participating voluntarily in learning can old intellectuals transform themselves. The movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has further strengthened my understanding.

    Because I understood the great significance of this movement, every patriotic person participated, and so did I. In addition to Peking University, I also participated in the work of the Beijing Municipal Committee for Inspection of Savings. This work educated me and tested me at the same time. This work made me more deeply understand the significance of this movement, made me realize what bourgeois decadent thoughts are, why bourgeois decadent thoughts must be eradicated, and I also understood what kind of fierce class struggle we must carry out in eradicating these decadent thoughts. As an old intellectual who needs to be transformed, I must carry out an even more fierce class struggle in my own thinking.

    The facts revealed by this movement initially only made me realize from an objective perspective the serious harm caused by corruption, waste, and bureaucracy and the necessity of eradicating them. Although I had realized that old intellectuals might all have problems with bureaucracy, corruption, and waste; although I participated in this movement and believed that this movement would be successfully completed; however, I had not engaged in a fierce class struggle in my own thinking. Therefore, I made a serious mistake. After visiting the two anti-waste exhibitions and the anti-waste conference at Peking University, when I explained my feelings in the group, I said: Some people in science and engineering look down on those who study social sciences as being empty, unplanned, and inefficient. Today, it seems that people in natural sciences have the same problems, and those who study social sciences can finally "breathe a sigh of relief." The four words "breathe a sigh of relief" exposed the root of my thinking.

    Although I learned a lot in the movement, a sense of schadenfreude was hidden in my thinking. The so-called learning a lot was just the recognition of objective facts, without combining it with my own thinking for examination. After combining it with my thinking for examination, I realized that the reason why people in natural sciences and social sciences have the same problems is only because we have not stood firm on the people's stand. We cannot get rid of the domination of ego-centrism, so we may have the same crimes that merchants can commit, such as monopoly, concealment, fraud, speculation, using public office for private gain, and everything else. Although there are differences in degree and form, there is no essential difference. These are the results of the erosion of bourgeois decadent thoughts. Only then did I realize that I was full of sores, and that I was so small and shameful.

    This movement made me deeply realize two points: First, we old intellectuals have long been more or less eroded by bourgeois decadent thoughts. This kind of thinking hinders us from being a people's teacher. We must fight off this kind of thinking so that we can unconditionally obey the interests of the people. Second, the reason why I made such a serious mistake while participating in the movement is only because I participated in the movement in form but not in thought. To fight off bourgeois decadent thoughts, we must always be a participant in thought as well.

    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义是最实际的思想改造运动
    我认识了我自己
    北京大学史学系教授  杨人楩
    在前一阶段的教师学习运动中，我认识到：只有作为一个参加者来自愿学习，旧知识分子才能改造自己。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动更坚定了我这一认识。
    因为理解到这个运动的重大意义，每一个热爱祖国的人民都参加进去，我也是如此。除北京大学外，我更一度参加北京市节约检查委员会小组工作。这些工作教育了我，同时也考验了我。这些工作使我更深切地明白这个运动的意义，使我认识到什么是资产阶级腐朽思想，为什么要根绝资产阶级腐朽思想，我又明白了在根绝这些腐朽思想时，我们要进行一个怎样激烈的阶级斗争，作为一个要改造的旧知识分子，更要在自己思想上进行更激烈的阶级斗争。
    这个运动所揭露出来的事实，最初只使我从客观现象上认识到贪污、浪费、官僚主义所造成的严重损害及其必须根除的道理。虽然我已体会到旧知识分子都可能有官僚主义、贪污和浪费的毛病；虽然我参加了此一运动并且相信此一运动必将胜利完成；可是，我不曾在自己思想上进行激烈的阶级斗争。因而我犯了严重的错误。在参观北京大学两次反浪费展览会及反浪费大会以后，我在小组中说明我的感想时，我曾说：有些学理工的人轻视学社会科学的人为空泛、无计划和不讲效率，今日看来学自然科学的人也有同样毛病，学社会科学的人可以出一口气。“出一口气”四个字就暴露出我的思想根源。
    虽然我在运动中学到不少，但我思想上隐藏着幸灾乐祸的心理。所谓学到不少只是客观事实的体认，而不曾结合自己的思想来检查。结合思想检查以后，我才发现学自然科学和社会科学的人之所以有同样毛病，只因我们都不曾站稳人民立场。我们不能摆脱自我中心思想的支配，于是商人所能犯的罪行如垄断、隐瞒、欺诈、投机取巧、假公济私及其他一切，我们都可能有，彼此虽有程度和形式之不同，然而无本质上的区别。这些就是资产阶级腐朽思想腐蚀的结果，我才认识到我是满身疮疤，我是这么渺小而可耻。
    这个运动就这么使我深切地认识了两点：第一、我们旧知识分子早已或多或少地受了资产阶级腐朽思想的腐蚀，这种思想阻碍我们做一个人民教师，我们必须把这种思想斗争掉，我们才能毫无保留地服从人民的利益。第二、我参加了运动而会犯那么严重的错误，只因我在形式上参加而不曾在思想上参加，要把资产阶级腐朽思想斗争掉，必须在思想上也始终是一个参加者。
