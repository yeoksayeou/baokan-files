To the Editor: The capitalist of the Shanghai private Hua Cheng Dyeing Factory is setting up a bogus business in an attempt to dismiss workers. Chen Minshan, the manager of this factory, secretly transported most of the factory's capital, such as pigments, to Hangzhou in 1950 and hid it. During inventory registration, Chen registered various goods under his private name and then sold these goods to the factory at high prices, withdrawing cash. Chen Minshan's purpose in doing this was to force the factory to close down in order to dismiss workers. The factory workers resolutely opposed this despicable behavior and demanded that the capitalist install the dyeing machines purchased over the past five or six years. The workers also mortgaged more than a dozen barrels of pigments stored in the factory to the bank and used the funds to buy other machines. After the workers installed the machines, Chen Minshan registered a bogus "Ding Shun" business with the Bureau of Industry and Commerce. He told the workers that the establishment of the "Ding Shun" business was to seek external business, and it would not be separated from the factory internally. But then he hired four temporary workers and wanted to use them to set up two organizations. The workers believe that it is unreasonable to divide into two organizations in the same factory, with the same boiler, and the same machines. Obviously, the capitalist's purpose is still the same as before, to lead the factory to closure. The workers have asked the Bureau of Industry and Commerce and the Labor Bureau to handle this issue, but no results have been obtained so far. Comrades from the Labor Bureau said to ask the Bureau of Industry and Commerce to handle it; however, comrades from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce told the workers to negotiate with the capitalist themselves. We believe that relevant departments should investigate and quickly assist the workers in resolving this issue.

    上海市私营华成染厂  
    资方企图非法解雇工人  
    有关部门应进行调查迅速解决
    编辑同志：上海市私营华成染厂资方虚设字号，企图解雇工人。这个厂的经理陈敏珊在一九五○年把厂里的颜料等大部分资金运往杭州藏匿。在存货登记时，陈把各种货物登入私人名下，再把这些货物用高价卖给厂里，抽回现金。陈敏珊这样做的目的就是要迫使工厂关闭，以便解雇工人。厂里的工人坚决反对这种卑鄙行为，要求资方把五、六年来买进的染布机器装置起来。工人们并把厂里所存颜料十几桶向银行抵押，再用这款买其他机器。工人们装好机器了，陈敏珊却以虚设的“鼎顺”字号向工商局登记。他对工人说，设立“鼎顺”字号是为了对外争取业务，对厂里内部并不分开。但接着他就雇用了四个临时工，并要利用他们搞两个机构。工人们认为在同一工厂、同一锅炉、同一机器等的情况下，分成两个机构是不合理的。很显然，资方的目的还是和以前的一样，想把这个厂引到关闭的道路上去。工人们曾要求工商局、劳动局处理这个问题，但到现在还没有得到结果。劳动局的同志说请工商局处理；可是，工商局的同志又叫工人们自己和资方协商。我们认为有关部门应进行调查，迅速协助工人解决这个问题。
