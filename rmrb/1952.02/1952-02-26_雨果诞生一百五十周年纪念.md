Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of Victor Hugo's Birth
Wen Jiasi

Victor Hugo—the great poet, novelist, playwright, and political activist of 19th-century France. As we approach the 150th anniversary of his birth, at least two of his characteristics are unforgettable.

First, we can never forget his friendship and sympathy for all the oppressed and exploited people in the world. Born into a petty-bourgeois family, he originally held a hostile attitude toward the aristocratic class; his long years of exile and his frequent contact with working people further aroused his hatred for the aristocratic class, thus deepening his friendship and sympathy for all the oppressed and exploited. Through "For the Poor," he offered advice to the wealthy and powerful; through "Night on the Sea" and "The Toilers of the Sea," he issued a profound cry to fate for the fishermen struggling against storms on the ocean late at night; through "The Song of the Life-Long Exile," he warmly comforted the warriors persecuted for fighting for the republic and freedom. And in his "Les Misérables," he more centrally expressed his humanitarian spirit. He sympathized with suffering humanity, even sympathizing with ugly and ignorant animals, toads, spiders, sick horses… Hugo regarded them all as
	“inferior brothers.” Hugo’s sympathy can be said to be bottomless and boundless. It was precisely by relying on this sympathy that he understood the sins and sufferings of society on the one hand, and connected with the hearts of the broad masses of readers on the other.

Second, we can never forget his firm and unyielding fighting will. He was already a heroic warrior in the French Romantic movement, and after Napoleon III’s coup d'état, in order to defend the republic and oppose autocracy, he demonstrated an even more unyielding fighting spirit. When Napoleon III issued an amnesty, he could have returned from overseas like many other political prisoners, but he did not do so. He preferred to live a life of exile rather than compromise with the ambitious usurper who had stolen state power. He used these lines of poetry to express his attitude:

	I pitch my tent in the midst of those who suffer,
	Because I want to stand up, I have become an outcast.
	I accept cruel banishment, even if it is endless,
	I will not inquire, nor will I consider whether anyone has already succumbed, though they should not have succumbed,
	Whether anyone else will leave, though they should not leave.
	If there are only a thousand people left, I will be one of them;
	If there are only a hundred people left, I will still not lay down my arms;
	If there are only ten people left, I will be the tenth person;
	If there is only one person left, I will be that one person!
	—“The Last Word”

In addition to the two characteristics already mentioned—his friendship and sympathy for the oppressed and exploited, and his firm and unyielding fighting will—his broad and profound art and his ardent love for his motherland are also unforgettable. Especially today, when imperialists are igniting the flames of war everywhere, when freedom and justice have not yet raised their heads in many places, when peace is being hindered, and happiness is being destroyed, even in Hugo’s motherland of France, the rulers are still as lewd, shameless, and evil-doing as Napoleon III, whom Hugo deeply despised. Hugo created a wealth of culture for France and humanity. In order to defend these treasures, in order to promote the realization of peace, and to shatter the conspiracy of aggression, we should fight even more heroically.

    雨果诞生一百五十周年纪念
    闻家驷
    雨果——十九世纪法国的大诗人，大小说家，大戏剧家，和政治活动家，在他的诞生一百五十周年纪念的前夕，想起这个伟大的名字，至少有两个特点是我们永远不能忘记的。
    一、我们永远不能忘记的，是他对世界上一切被压迫者和被剥削者的友爱与同情。他出身于小资产阶级家庭，对贵族阶级原是采取敌对的态度的；长期的放逐生活和他与劳动人民经常的接触，更加激起了他对贵族阶级的憎恨，因而也就加深了他对一切被压迫者和被剥削者的友爱与同情。通过“为了穷苦的人们”，他向豪门富翁提出劝告；通过“海洋上的黑夜”与“穷苦人”，他替深夜在海洋上和暴风雨搏斗的渔夫向命运发出沉痛的呼号；通过“终身流放者之歌”，他亲切地安慰了为争取共和与自由而遭受迫害的战士，而他在他的“悲惨世界”里面则是更集中地表现出他的人道主义的精神。他同情苦难深重的人类，甚至也同情丑陋愚昧的动物，蛤蟆，蜘蛛，病马……，雨果都把它们当作
    “低级的弟兄”。雨果的同情心可以说是深无底，阔无边的。而他正是依靠这种同情心，一方面理解了社会的罪恶和苦难，另一方面联系了广大读者的心灵。
    二、我们永远不能忘记的，是他的坚强不屈的战斗意志。他在法国的浪漫主义运动中，已是一员英勇的战士，而他在拿破仑第三的政变以后，为了捍卫共和，反对专制，他更表现了不屈的战斗精神。当拿破仑第三颁行赦令的时候，他原是可以像许多其他的政治犯一样从海外归来的，然而他没有这样做。他宁可终身过着流亡的生活而不愿与盗窃国家政权的枭雄妥协。他用这样几句诗来表明他的态度：
    我在受难的人群中支起我的帐篷，
    因为我要站起来，所以我作了逐客。
    我接受了残酷的放逐，即令它是漫无尽期的，
    我也不去询查，我也不去考虑是否有人已经屈服了，虽说他是不应该屈服的，
    是否有人还要离开，虽说他是不应该离开的。
    如果只剩下一千个人，我一定是其中之一；
    万一只剩下一百个人，我还是不放下武器；
    如果只剩下十个人，我就是那第十个人；
    如果只剩下一个人，我就是那一个人！
    ——“最后的话”
    除了前面已经指出的他对被压迫者和被剥削者的友爱与同情以及他的坚强不屈的战斗意志这两个特点以外，还有他的博大精深的艺术和他对于祖国的热烈的爱，那也是我们永远不能忘记的。尤其是在今天，帝国主义者到处燃起战争的火焰，自由与正义在许多地方还没有抬起头来，和平被阻碍着，幸福被破坏着，就是在雨果的祖国法兰西，统治者也还是和当年雨果所深恶痛绝的拿破仑第三一样地荒淫无耻，制造罪恶。雨果为法兰西和人类创造了文化的财富，为了保卫这些财富，为了促进和平的实现，粉碎侵略的阴谋，我们应当更英勇地战斗。
