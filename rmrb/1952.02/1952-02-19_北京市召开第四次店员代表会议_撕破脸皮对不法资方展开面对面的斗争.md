Xinhua News Agency: Beijing -- The Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened the Fourth Municipal Shop Employees’ Representative Meeting on the 14th to exchange experiences in struggle and determine further measures to launch a fierce struggle against illegal industrialists and businessmen.

In order to thoroughly defeat the bourgeoisie’s frenzied attacks, this conference determined the following tasks for shop employees and workers throughout the city: First, strengthen the education of shop employees and workers, thoroughly recognize the ugly face of the bourgeoisie, draw a clear line between the working class and the bourgeoisie, resolutely counterattack the bourgeoisie’s frenzied attacks, and defend and consolidate the working class's leadership over the country. Second, continue to mobilize shop employees to tear off the mask and engage in face-to-face struggles with illegal capitalists. Adopt the method of shop employees meeting with capitalists to check face-to-face whether the facts confessed by the capitalists still have any concealment, so that the bourgeoisie bows its head to acknowledge the leadership of the working class and dares not engage in illegal activities again. Third, consolidate and expand the organization of shop employees' unions. The bourgeoisie's attack on trade union organizations has also been rampant over the past three years. They have corrupted trade union cadres. For example, six out of the chairmen and vice-chairmen of six shop employees' unions have been found to be guilty of corruption; they have infiltrated trade union organizations. For example, it has been discovered that some trade union cadres have even stolen workers' accusation materials for the capitalists. Trade unions must eliminate these trade union scabs and running dogs, purify the ranks of the working class, consolidate trade union organizations, and promote activists to work in trade union organizations at all levels during the movement, and expand and strengthen the organization of shop employees' unions.

Shop employees Li Shudong, Wu Zhaoning, Luo Hai, and others made typical reports at the meeting, introducing their experiences in organizing "Confession Meetings" and "Reasoning Teams" to urge capitalists to frankly confess their problems.

At the meeting, all representatives unanimously passed a resolution to resolutely and thoroughly crush the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks. Shop employees and workers from various industries also put forward guaranteed conditions for implementing the resolution.

    北京市召开第四次店员代表会议
    撕破脸皮对不法资方展开面对面的斗争
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：北京市总工会在十四日召开全市第四次店员代表会议，交流斗争经验，并确定进一步对违法的工商业者展开猛烈的斗争。
    为了彻底打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，这次大会确定全市店员工人今后的工作任务是：第一，加强教育店员工人，彻底认清资产阶级的丑恶面目，划清工人阶级和资产阶级的界限，对资产阶级的猖狂进攻进行坚决的反攻，保卫和巩固工人阶级对国家的领导权。第二，继续发动店员，和不法资方撕破脸皮，进行面对面的斗争。采取店员和资方见面办法，面对面地检查资方坦白的事实是否还有隐瞒，使资产阶级低头承认工人阶级的领导，不敢再干违法活动。第三，巩固和扩大店员工会的组织。资产阶级在三年来对工会组织的进攻也是猖狂的，他们腐蚀工会干部，如在六个店员工会的正副主席中，已发现有六个人贪污腐化；他们打入工会组织，如已发现有的工会干部竟替资方偷工人的检举材料。工会必须清除这些工贼、走狗，纯洁工人阶级的队伍，巩固工会组织，在运动中提拔积极分子到各级工会组织中去工作，扩大与加强店员工会的组织。
    店员李树栋、武兆宁、罗海等在会议中作了典型报告，介绍了他们组织“坦白会”、“说理队”督促资本家坦白交代问题的经验。
    会上，全体代表一致通过了坚决彻底打垮资产阶级疯狂进攻的决议。各行业店员工人并提出了执行决议的保证条件。
