Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 26th: France, burdened by the heavy weight of its rearmament policy, is facing a severe threat from the rapid depletion of its dollar and gold reserves and the continuous plummeting of its currency's credit, just one month after the new Faure government took office.

As early as last November, according to the American "Newsweek," France's gold and dollar reserves were only slightly more than 740 million U.S. dollars, less than 14 percent of the pre-war level. In order to salvage the crisis, the then-Pleven government had put in great effort to pass a so-called "savings plan," drastically cutting imports paid for in U.S. dollars. However, the root cause of France's dollar crisis in foreign trade lies in the French government subordinating its economy to the United States and engaging in a frantic arms race. Therefore, this "savings plan" could neither solve this fundamental problem nor prevent the further deterioration of the dollar crisis. According to a report in January of this year by the so-called "European Payments Union," France's payment deficit with other countries in the union reached more than 230 million U.S. dollars. Faure government's Minister of Economic Affairs, Mr. Brunfaut, admitted on February 3rd that France's payment deficit with the so-called European Payments Union had caused France's dollar losses to account for 40 percent of its total debt; if the deficit continues at the current rate, by the end of February, this figure will increase to 60 percent. Due to the deficit in dollar payments, France's gold and dollar reserves had fallen to less than 600 million U.S. dollars by the beginning of February.

At the same time, huge military expenditures have created a huge deficit in the government budget (the deficit in 1951 reached 800 billion francs). The government is using the issuance of more banknotes to make up for this deficit, resulting in more serious inflation. As of January 3rd, the amount of banknotes issued had reached an astonishing 1,852 billion francs, an increase of about one-half compared to when the franc was devalued in 1949. Under the dual impact of inflation and the dollar shortage, the credit of the franc has plummeted. According to Reuters, on the "free market" in Paris on the 22nd, the franc exchange rate fell again, from 473 francs to one U.S. dollar on the 21st to 482 francs to one U.S. dollar, about one-third lower than when it was just devalued, and 132 francs more than the official rate. Even Faure had to admit that the franc had become one of the most unstable currencies in Europe. Now there is a lot of talk about the franc being devalued again.

Like previous French governments, the Faure government obsequiously follows U.S. imperialism in order to win a few hundred million dollars of so-called "aid." However, the United States has withheld most of the "aid" funds originally promised, using this as a threat to force the Faure government to more vigorously implement the U.S. rearmament plan. Under these circumstances, the Faure government had to announce on February 3rd that it was expanding import restrictions to secondary imports from "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" countries. On the 19th, it further expanded the restrictions to all imports from these countries, including food, raw materials, and other necessary goods, and stipulated additional restrictions on foreign trade. These superficial measures will certainly not solve France's current financial crisis. According to a United Press International dispatch on the 21st, financial experts in Paris unanimously believed that "these measures cannot cure France's critically ill economic crisis," and said: "Even devaluing the franc is not a permanent solution to France's economic problems, because the necessary conditions for a comprehensive stabilization plan do not exist."

As some spokespersons of the Faure government have indicated, the basic policy of the current French government to solve the financial crisis is still to beg for alms from the United States. This policy is bound to tie France more tightly to the U.S. chariot and lead to more serious economic and political crises.

### 法国财政危机严重  美元储备迅速枯竭法郎信用暴跌

    法国财政危机严重
    美元储备迅速枯竭法郎信用暴跌
    【新华社二十六日讯】巴黎消息：在备战政策重担下的法国，美元和黄金储备的迅速枯竭和货币信用的暴跌不已正严重地威胁着上台才一个月的富尔政府。
    早在去年十一月，据美国“新闻周刊”透露，法国的黄金和美元储备就只有七亿四千多万美元，不足战前的百分之十四。为了挽救危局，当时的普利文政府曾经花了很大气力，通过了一个所谓“节约计划”，大量削减美元货的进口。可是，法国的对外贸易上的美元危机，其根源在于法国政府将法国的经济从属于美国并进行疯狂的备战运动。因此，这个“节约计划”既不能解决这个根本问题，也无法阻止美元危机的进一步恶化。据所谓“欧洲支付同盟”今年一月份的报告透露，法国对这个同盟其他各国的支付逆差达二亿三千多万美元。富尔政府的经济部长布隆在二月三日承认：法国对所谓欧洲支付同盟的支付逆差已经使法国的美元亏损占它整个债务的百分之四十；如果逆差照目前速度继续下去，到二月底，这个数字就要增加到百分之六十。由于美元支付上的逆差，法国黄金和美元的储备在二月初已减低到不足六亿美元。
    同时，巨额的军备费用造成了政府预算的巨大赤字。（一九五一年赤字达八千亿法郎）政府用增发纸币来弥补这笔赤字，结果是通货膨胀更加严重。到一月三日为止，纸币发行额已经达到一万八千五百二十亿法郎的惊人数字，较一九四九年法郎贬值时增加了约二分之一。在通货膨胀和美元荒的双重冲击下，法郎信用暴跌。据路透社透露，在巴黎“自由市场”上，二十二日法郎比价再度下跌，已从二十一日的四百七十三法郎对一美元跌到要四百八十二法郎才能换一美元，比刚贬值时低约三分之一，比官定比率要多一百三十二个法郎。甚至富尔也不得不承认：法郎已经成为欧洲最不稳定的货币之一。现在法郎再度贬值的议论又甚嚣尘上。
    富尔政府像历届法国政府一样，奴颜婢膝地追随美帝国主义，以博取几亿美元的所谓“援助”。可是美国却扣住了原来答应给它的大部“援助”款项，以此威胁富尔政府更卖力地执行美国的备战计划。在这种情况下，富尔政府不得不在二月三日宣布扩大入口限制到“欧洲经济合作局”国家的次要入口货，十九日又再扩大限制到来自这些国家的一切入口货，包括食物、原料和其他一些必需物资在内，并且规定了另外一些对外贸易的限制。这些舍本逐末的办法，自然绝不能解决法国目前的财政危机。据合众社二十一日电，巴黎的财政专家们就一致认为“这些措施并不能医治病入膏肓的法国经济危机”，并且说：“就是把法郎贬值也不是解决法国经济问题的永久办法，因为全面稳定计划的必要条件并不存在。”
    像富尔政府的一些发言人所表示的，法国现政府解决财政危机的基本政策仍然是乞讨美国的布施。这个政策势必使法国更紧地束缚在美国的战车上，并招致更严重的经济和政治危机。
