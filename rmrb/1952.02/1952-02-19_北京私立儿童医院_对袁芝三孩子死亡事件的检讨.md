Column: Response to Criticisms and Suggestions from Readers of the People's Daily

To the Editor: The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily on February 7 published a letter titled "Oppose Bureaucracy in Medical Work," which included criticism of our hospital. It is true that nurse Liu Guangyun took the wrong medicine, and Dr. Zhang Wenrui did not identify it before injecting it, resulting in the death of Yuan Zhisan's child. However, some of the details are slightly different from the facts: at the time of the injection, because the child's blood vessels were thin and difficult to find, several attempts were made to insert the needle, which took some time, but it was not "random poking" and did not take as long as an hour; also, the doctor did not "leave laughing" after the injection was completed. However, the occurrence of this accident was indeed caused by Dr. Zhang Wenrui and nurse Liu Guangyun's careless work style and their irresponsible attitude towards people's lives, and it is also related to the bureaucracy of the hospital's leadership at all levels. This mistake is unforgivable. After the incident occurred, we immediately reported the details to the health authorities and requested the judicial authorities to impose penalties. At the same time, the hospital announced the incident to all staff members and conducted criticism and self-criticism. Everyone agreed that we must strengthen political study in the future, constantly check our work, establish the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again.

### 北京私立儿童医院  对袁芝三孩子死亡事件的检讨

    北京私立儿童医院
    对袁芝三孩子死亡事件的检讨
    编辑同志：人民日报二月七日“读者来信”栏发表了“反对医务工作中的官僚主义”的信件，其中有一段是批评我院的。刘光芸护士确实取错了药，张文瑞大夫又不加识别，即行注射，致把袁芝三的孩子治死了。但是其中有一些与事实略有出入：当时注射时，因孩子血管细，不易找到，确实扎了好几针，费了一些时间，但不是“乱扎”，也没有费一小时长的时间；又注射完毕时，医师并没有“欢笑而去”。但是这一事故的发生，确是由于张文瑞大夫及刘光芸护士对工作粗枝大叶、对人民生命不负责任的作风所引起的，而且它与我院各部门领导方面的官僚主义也是有关的。这个过失是不可宽恕的。事情发生后，我们曾经立刻把事情发生的经过向卫生领导机关呈报，并请求司法机关给予处分。同时，院方在全体工作人员中宣布了这一事件，进行批评与自我批评。大家都认为以后必须加强政治学习，随时检查工作，树立全心全意为人民服务的思想，保证以后不再发生类似的事件。
