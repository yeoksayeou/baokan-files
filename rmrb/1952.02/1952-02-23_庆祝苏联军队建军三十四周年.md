    Celebrating the 34th Anniversary of the Founding of the Soviet Army
    Nie Rongzhen
    Today, on the occasion of the 34th anniversary of the founding of the great Soviet Army, we cannot help but recall the Order No. 7 issued by the great Marshal Stalin, in his capacity as the Minister of the Soviet Armed Forces, to all officers and soldiers of the Soviet Red Army and Red Navy and all working people in the first year of peaceful construction after the end of World War II, when the Soviet people were restoring peace. In this order, the Great Marshal Stalin pointed out: "In developing socialist peaceful construction, we should not forget for a moment the international reactionaries who are planning new wars, and we must remember Lenin's lesson to us: After turning to peaceful labor, we should always be vigilant and protect our armed forces and defense capabilities like the apple of our eye." Today, not only in the Soviet Union, but also in all people's democratic countries, and throughout the world, it is of great benefit for all conscious working people to re-examine this order issued by the Great Marshal Stalin six years ago.
    Today, as the international reactionaries – the imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States as the culprit – are planning new wars and are frantically preparing to carry out a new war, all peace-loving people in the world, in order to avoid the disasters of war and to pursue a peaceful and happy life, cannot but more enthusiastically place their hopes on the world peace defender – the just armed forces of mankind represented by the Soviet Army. The Chinese people and the progressive people of the world are today warmly celebrating the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, because people deeply know that the Soviet Army's powerful invincibility is not only sufficient to guarantee the smooth development of the Soviet people's peaceful construction, but also a huge guarantee for defending world peace and security.
    The Soviet Army, from its early days of smashing the intervention troops of fourteen countries and bandits such as Denikin, Kolchak, and Krasnov, and achieving brilliant victories, to eliminating ten million German Nazis and their vassal troops in World War II, liberating Eastern Europe, annihilating the entire Japanese Kwantung Army, and liberating Northeast China and Korea, all these facts prove that it is the most outstanding and indestructible revolutionary armed force in human history. It is the army of the Soviet working people, and it is an army imbued with the spirit of internationalism. The founder and leader of the Soviet Army is none other than the great commander of the armed forces who represents the lofty justice of modern humanity and defends world peace, and the founder of advanced Soviet military science – the great Stalin. The historical victories won by the Soviet Armed Forces are all ironclad proof of the powerful, effective and vigorous nature of Stalin's military science.
    The path taken by the Soviet Army and the characteristics it possesses are also the path taken by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the characteristics it strives to learn and must maintain. Under the brilliant guidance of its wise creator and leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has experienced twenty-five years of continuous revolutionary war and has grown stronger in battles against domestic and foreign enemies. After achieving the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and establishing the People's Republic of China, we have also never forgotten for a moment the steps taken by the international reactionaries who are planning new wars to carry out new aggression against our country. However, thanks to the victorious experience of the Soviet Army and our own victorious experience, we have nothing to fear, and we will continue to advance from victory to victory. We must not only liberate our territory of Taiwan, but also be vigilant at all times in order to defend the peaceful labor of our people and defend peace in the Far East and the world, and we must intensify our efforts to consolidate our national defense.
    We are particularly pleased that on the vast northern border of our great motherland, standing shoulder to shoulder with us is the invincible heroic brother – the great socialist country guarded by the Soviet Army and the Mongolian People's Republic guarded by the heroic Mongolian People's Army. Let the imperialists envy us; if their aggressive war "spears"妄想reach into our territory, they will surely be cut off. Our People's Liberation Army is guarding the eastern, southern, and western borders of our country day and night. The victorious banner of our great motherland and the People's Liberation Army is flying in the wind. The desperate harassment carried out by the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops supported by U.S. imperialism on the border between China and Myanmar is doomed to failure. In order to prepare for a new war of aggression, no matter how shamelessly imperialism slanders the Soviet Union and our country, and attempts to deceive and drive the masses of people under their rule onto the path of a new war of aggression, they cannot but see that on the front of the struggle to defend peace in the Far East and the world, the powerful and invincible Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are standing solemnly.
    The goal of the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union in struggle is the same, which is to defend peace in the Far East and the world, and to resolutely prevent the re-aggression of Japanese aggressive forces and their accomplices. We will never tolerate the unilateral "Peace Treaty with Japan" illegally signed at the San Francisco Conference manipulated by the United States, nor the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," nor the evil plan of the United States to revive Japanese militarism and rearm Japan, nor the military threats to the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, and the threats to the security of the entire Asia, created by the U.S. aggressors. In particular, we resolutely oppose the U.S. aggressors' interference in the Korean War and all their crimes in Korea. The U.S. aggressive troops' large-scale bloody slaughter in Korea cannot save them from their disastrous fate. Now, they recklessly and openly violate human justice and international law, and carry out the inhuman large-scale bacteriological warfare. This proves that the crimes committed by the U.S. aggressive troops are no different from the crimes committed by the Japanese fascist troops in those years, and even surpass them. We demand that all peace-loving and just people in the world launch a just condemnation of the U.S. aggressors' frenzied and brutal atrocities.
    We have high respect for the Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army who are fighting heroically in Korea. In the great struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, our people have formed the world-renowned Chinese People's Volunteers, who fight side by side with the Korean People's Army. They have a high degree of patriotism and internationalism, which is the source of the invincible strength of all just revolutionary armies. The experience of the Soviet Army and Marxist military science have once again been proven here. The Soviet Army and other people's revolutionary armies defend human justice and the interests of the working people, while the aggressors' armies are enemies of human justice and the interests of the working people. This determines that the aggressors cannot but fail, and we must win.
    On the occasion of celebrating the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, we should love and support the great Soviet Army even more, just as we love and support our own people's army. We should further strengthen the close friendship between the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union, and fully mobilize all officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to conscientiously learn from the rich experience and heroic example of the Soviet Army. We must further study and master Marxist military science and modern military technology, and redouble our military strength in order to consolidate the national defense of our great motherland and strive together with the Soviet Army to defend peace in the Far East and the world.

    庆祝苏联军队建军三十四周年
    聂荣臻
    在伟大的苏联军队建军三十四周年纪念的今天，我们不能不特别记起在第二次世界大战结束之后，在苏联人民战后第一年恢复和平建设的时候，伟大的斯大林大元帅，以当时他所直接担任的苏联武装部部长的名义，向苏联红军、红海军全体将士和全体劳动人民所发布的第七号命令。在这个命令中，斯大林大元帅指出：“在发展社会主义和平建设时，我们不应一刻忘怀正在筹思新战争计划的国际反动派，必须记住列宁给我们的教训：转向和平劳动之后，我们应该时常警戒并像保护眼睛一样去保护我国武装部队和防御力量。”今天不但在苏联，而且在各人民民主国家、在全世界，一切觉悟的劳动人民，都来重新温习斯大林大元帅在六年前所发布的这一道命令，是有莫大益处的。
    今天，当着国际反动派——以美国为罪魁的帝国主义侵略集团，正在筹思新战争计划，并正疯狂地准备实行一个新的战争的时候，全世界一切爱好和平的人民，为了避免战争的灾难，为了追求和平幸福的生活，都不能不更加热烈地把他们的希望寄托于全世界和平的保卫者——以苏联军队为代表的人类正义的武装力量之上了。中国人民和全世界进步人民今天都在热烈地庆贺苏联军队建军的三十四周年，因为人们深知：苏联军队的强大无敌，不但足以保障苏联人民的和平建设事业的顺利发展，而且对于捍卫世界和平与安全是一个巨大的保障。
    苏联军队从它年轻的时候粉碎十四国干涉军和邓尼金、高尔察克、克拉斯诺夫等匪徒而取得辉煌的胜利开始，一直到第二次世界大战中消灭德国纳粹及其附庸军一千万人、解放了东欧，歼灭了日本关东军全部、解放我国东北和朝鲜，这一切事实证明它是人类有史以来最卓越的无坚不摧的革命武装力量。它是苏联劳动人民军队，它是浸透着国际主义精神的军队。苏联军队的缔造者和指导者不是别人，正是代表现代人类崇高正义并捍卫世界和平的武装部队的伟大统帅、先进的苏联军事科学的创始者——伟大的斯大林。苏联武装部队所赢得的历史性的胜利，无一不是斯大林军事科学强大有力和生气勃勃的铁证。
    苏联军队所走过的道路和它所具备的特点，也是中国人民解放军所走的道路和努力学习并必须保持的特点。中国人民解放军在它的英明的创造者和领导者毛泽东主席的天才指引之下，经历了二十五年间不断的革命战争的锻炼，在和国内外敌人作战中成长壮大起来。在取得了中国人民革命的伟大胜利和建立了中华人民共和国之后，我们同样一刻也没有忘怀正在筹思新战争计划的国际反动派对我国实行新侵略的步骤。但是，由于有了苏联军队的胜利经验和我们自己的胜利经验，我们毫无所惧，我们一定要继续从胜利走向胜利。我们不但要解放我国的领土台湾，而且要为保卫我国人民的和平劳动、保卫远东与世界和平而时常警戒着，并要为巩固我们的国防而加紧努力。
    我们感到特别欣喜的是：在我们伟大祖国辽阔的北部边疆上，和我们并肩而立的是无敌的英雄弟兄——苏联军队所守卫的伟大社会主义国家和英勇的蒙古人民军所守卫的蒙古人民共和国。让帝国主义者去嫉恨我们吧，他们的侵略战争的“长矛”如果妄想伸进我们的国境，就一定要被斩断的。我们的人民解放军正在朝夕守卫着我国东部、南部和西部的边疆。我们伟大祖国和人民解放军的胜利旗帜正在迎风飘扬。美帝国主义者支持蒋匪残余部队在中缅边界所进行的绝望的骚扰，是注定要失败的。帝国主义为了准备新的侵略战争，不管怎样无耻地诽谤苏联和我国，并企图以欺骗手段，驱使他们统治下的人民群众走上新的侵略战争的道路，但他们却不能不看到，在为捍卫远东与世界和平而斗争的战线上，正庄严地站立着强大无敌的苏联军队和中国人民解放军。
    中苏两国伟大同盟的斗争的目的是共同的，这就是保卫远东与世界的和平，坚决防止日本侵略势力及其同谋者的重新侵略。我们决不能容忍美国一手操纵的旧金山会议非法签订的片面“对日和约”以及“美日安全条约”，不能容忍美国力图复活日本军国主义和重新武装日本的罪恶计划，不能容忍美国侵略者所造成的对中华人民共和国和苏联的军事威胁，及对整个亚洲安全的威胁。尤其是对于美国侵略者干涉朝鲜战争及其在朝鲜的一切罪行，我们更坚决反对。美国侵略军在朝鲜大规模实行血腥的屠杀，丝毫不能挽救他们惨败的命运，现在他们竟不顾一切地公然违犯人类正义和国际公法，实行了灭绝人性的大规模的细菌战争。这证明美国侵略者的军队与当年日本法西斯的军队所犯的罪行并无二致，并且超过。我们要求世界一切爱好和平正义的人民向美国侵略者疯狂残暴的兽行发出正义的声讨。
    我们对于在朝鲜英勇作战的中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军寄予高度的崇敬。我国人民在伟大的抗美援朝的斗争中，组成了闻名世界的中国人民志愿军，和朝鲜人民军并肩作战，他们具有高度的爱国主义和国际主义的精神，这正是一切正义的革命的军队所向无敌的力量的源泉。苏联军队的经验和马克思主义的军事科学在这里又得到了新的证明。苏联军队和其他人民革命的军队是保卫人类正义和劳动人民利益的，而侵略者的军队是与人类正义和劳动人民利益为敌的，这就决定了侵略者不能不失败，而我们一定要胜利。
    在庆祝苏联军队建军三十四周年的今天，我们应该更加热爱和拥护伟大的苏联军队，就像热爱和拥护我国人民自己的军队一样。我们应该进一步加强中苏两国人民和两国军队的亲密的友谊，并充分地发动我国人民解放军的全体指战员，认真地学习苏联军队的丰富经验和英雄的榜样。我们要进一步学习和掌握马克思主义的军事科学和现代化的军事技术，百倍加强我国的军事力量，为巩固我们伟大祖国的国防，并与苏联军队共同为保卫远东与世界和平而奋斗。
