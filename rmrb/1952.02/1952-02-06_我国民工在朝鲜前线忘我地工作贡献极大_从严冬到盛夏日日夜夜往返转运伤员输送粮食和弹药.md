Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, 5th - Our correspondent reports: Tens of thousands of Chinese laborers, from the harsh winter to the height of summer, day and night, have been transporting the wounded and sick, delivering grain and ammunition back and forth on the Korean front and in the rear, making significant contributions to the victory of the war. The work of the laborers is arduous; they often carry heavy supplies in the dark, traversing rough and uneven mountain roads. But they never complain. Many labor teams launched a "Five Goods" competition: good loading, good transportation, good unloading, good concealment, and good protection. They have increased the speed of loading and unloading trains and cars by more than six times in one year. When the labor team from Benxi County, Liaodong Province, first went abroad, it took twenty-four people one hour to unload one train car of supplies. Now, they have created a new record of six people unloading one train car of supplies in just fifteen minutes, increasing the speed by sixteen times. The speed of loading a car with supplies has also increased by eighteen times. Among the more than one thousand laborers in the team, 355 heroes who cherished supplies, worked actively, and improved loading and unloading methods, and fourteen model units, emerged within a year.
        The laborers also put forward the slogan "Not a grain of rice lost, not a single item damaged," protecting supplies selflessly and forgetting themselves. Li Anchun, a labor hero from Xin'jin County, Liaodong Province, carried 130 kilograms of grain over mountains and ridges for twenty-five days of night marching to deliver it to the front. When he saw his comrades lagging behind due to physical fatigue, he disregarded his own fatigue and helped his comrades share half of the grain. He said, "Delivering one more grain of rice, one more bullet to the front, will support the front-line soldiers to kill one more enemy. No matter how tired or bitter we are, we cannot lose a single grain of rice or a single bullet!" During the floods last summer, the laborers of the Jin County labor team in western Liaoning Province, in order to prevent the motherland's supplies from getting damp, continuously rushed to transport them in the rain for three days and nights, moving the supplies to dry places and digging many field warehouses to protect them. During the transportation, they found oil drums leaking, so they tore cotton from their cotton clothes to plug them. When grain bags were broken, they untied their leg straps and shoelaces to tie them up. When they saw grain spilled on the ground, they carefully swept it up and sent it to the warehouse. Many laborers even automatically sewed and repaired broken bags and boxes at any time, greatly reducing the consumption of various grains, ammunition, and supplies during transportation. In the work of transporting the wounded, the laborers' love and care for the wounded were even more touching. Many laborers, in the severe cold, were willing to freeze themselves and take off their cotton-padded coats and overcoats to cover the wounded. Some laborers froze their ears because they took off their cotton hats to wrap the wounded's feet.

    我国民工在朝鲜前线忘我地工作贡献极大
    从严冬到盛夏日日夜夜往返转运伤员输送粮食和弹药
    【新华社朝鲜前线五日电】本社记者报道：数以万计的中国民工们，从严冬到盛夏，日日夜夜往返在朝鲜前线和后方转运伤员，输送粮食、弹药，为战争的胜利作了重大的贡献。民工们的工作是艰苦的，他们经常在黑夜里搬运沉重的物资往返在坎坷不平的山道上。但他们从不叫苦。许多民工队，展开了装好、运好、卸好、隐蔽好、保护好“五好”竞赛运动。他们装卸火车、汽车的速度在一年中提高了六倍以上。辽东省本溪县民工队在刚出国时，卸完一车皮的物资二十四个人需要一小时，现在创造了六个人卸完一车皮物资只需要十五分钟的新纪录，速度较前提高了十六倍；装一辆汽车物资的速度也较前提高了十八倍。在该队一千多名民工中，一年内涌现出三百五十五名爱护物资、积极劳动、改进装卸方法的功臣和十四个模范单位。
    民工们并且提出“不损一粒米，不坏一件物”的口号，舍身忘我地保护物资。辽东省新金县民工功臣李安春，在二十五天的夜行军中，挑了一百三十斤粮食翻山越岭送上前线。当他看到他的同伴因为身体疲劳落在后面时，他就不顾自己的疲劳，又帮着他的同伴分挑了一半粮食。他说：“多把一粒米、一颗弹送到前线，就能支援前方战士多打死一个敌人。我们再累再苦也不能丢掉一粒米、一颗弹！”在去年夏天洪水泛滥期间，辽西省锦县民工队的民工们为了使祖国的物资不受潮湿，曾连续在雨水中抢运三昼夜，把物资转运到干燥的地方，并挖了许多个保护物资的野战仓库。在搬运中他们发现油桶漏了就把自己棉衣里的棉花扯出来塞上，粮食袋子破了就把自己的腿带鞋带解下来扎上，看到撒到地上的粮食，就细心地扫起来送到仓库里去。许多民工更自动随时缝补和修理破漏了的袋子、箱子，大大减少了各种粮、弹、物资在搬运途中的消耗量。在转运伤员的工作中，民工们对伤员的热爱照顾更令人感动。有许多民工在严寒的天气里，情愿自己挨冻、脱下自己的棉袄、大衣给伤员盖上。有的民工因摘下自己的棉帽子给伤员包脚而冻坏了自己的耳朵。
