    Guizhou Tobacco Company Accounting Section Chief
    Major Embezzler Zheng Bingkun Arrested and Brought to Justice
    Embezzled Cigarettes Alone Worth More Than 4.8 Billion Yuan
    [This Newspaper's Report] Zheng Bingkun, the accounting section chief of the Guizhou Tobacco Company, a major embezzler who stole a huge amount of state property, stubbornly refused to confess, and sabotaged the anti-corruption movement, has been arrested and brought to justice.
    Zheng Bingkun was a retained employee. His criminal activities of stealing state property began in January 1951 after he became the accounting section chief of the Guizhou Tobacco Company. According to mass reports and preliminary investigations, his significant criminal acts include:
    A. Huge Embezzlement Activities: (1) Out of the 6,472 large boxes of various brands of cigarettes produced by the company in 1951, after offsetting sales and inventory, 911 large boxes of cigarettes were unaccounted for. Calculated at the average unit price, this amounts to a staggering 4,862,926,750 yuan in Renminbi. (2) From January 1, 1951, to the end of December, more than 90% of the transfer notices for the purchase of materials and sale of finished products by the Management Section of the Provincial Department of Industry had no original documents for verification. Many transfers in the "Total-Branch Transactions" account by the Auditing Section also lacked original vouchers. According to incomplete statistics, the total amount of transfers without original documents for the entire year of 1951 was 14,458,076,755 yuan in Renminbi. In addition to this, Zheng also altered original documents for theft. Preliminary statistics show that the transfers without original documents and the altered documents accepted by Zheng totaled more than 14 billion yuan. This is ironclad proof of Zheng's collusion with the "Four King Kongs" (Li Yu?, etc.), corrupt elements in the Management Section of the Guizhou Provincial Department of Industry, to carry out massive embezzlement activities. (3) Purchasing large quantities of the company's own cigarettes through illicit means. According to preliminary investigations, from July 10, 1950, to October 24, 1951, he illicitly purchased 22.5 large boxes of "Model" cigarettes, and on August 27, 1951, he illicitly purchased 10 large boxes of the company's "Penguin" cigarettes, stealing 70,268,225 yuan of state property in these two illicit purchases.
    B. Sabotaging Production in Various Ways. According to the totals from January to November 1951, the prices of cigarettes sold outside the province and returned were lower than the cost of production, resulting in a loss of 679,914,526 yuan. If the loss of legitimate profits is added, the total loss is 970,444,319 yuan. Because Zheng, as the accounting section chief, did not calculate according to cost and arbitrarily determined factory prices, the loss from the sale of cigarettes outside the province alone amounted to more than 900 million yuan (sales within the province not included). At the same time, Zheng colluded with the "Four King Kongs" to delay the transfer of accounts after the Provincial Department of Industry's Management Section delivered tobacco leaves to the company in the first half of 1951 (some delayed for more than six months). Because the purchase price of tobacco leaves differed greatly from the price when the accounts were transferred and the market price at the time of the valuation (according to the highest estimates of Guizhou market conditions), the company suffered a loss of more than 640 million yuan. Due to the delay in transferring accounts or collecting payments, the company was in long-term arrears to the Management Section of the Provincial Department of Industry for huge sums of money. In the first six months of 1951 alone, the excess interest paid was 235,439,325 yuan. The above two items totaled a loss of 881,459,815 yuan in Renminbi. Selling state commercial intelligence was also one of Zheng's criminal activities of embezzlement and sabotage of production. For example, on August 28, 1951, the Guiyang Cigarette Association called the company to buy cigarettes. Zheng said on the phone that the price of cigarettes was going to fall and told them not to rush to buy. According to incomplete statistics, this item alone caused an estimated loss of 54,510,000 yuan in state property. In order to cover up his serious crimes of stealing state property and sabotaging production, Zheng Bingkun deliberately disrupted the accounts. According to preliminary investigations, the accounts of the accounting section did not match the accounts of the business section or the planning section, nor did they match the accounts of the various workshops. Comparing the number of tobacco leaves received by the leaf-making workshop from January to November 1951 with the number on Zheng's account books, Zheng's account books showed 7,141 more catties than the leaf-making workshop.
    After the anti-corruption movement was enthusiastically launched in the Guizhou Tobacco Company, Zheng stubbornly refused to repent and confess. He also emphasized "studying culture" and did not allow workers to hold meetings during study time (because Zheng was the cultural and educational committee member of the trade union and concurrently the principal of the industrial spare-time school), forcing employees to rehearse plays in a vain attempt to obstruct the development of the movement. The company leadership then convened a struggle meeting against Zheng Bingkun for all employees on the evening of January 14. With the approval of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government, the public security organs immediately arrested Zheng Bingkun on the spot and sent him to the court for legal proceedings.

    贵州烟草公司会计课长  
    大贪污犯郑炳琨被逮捕法办  
    只侵吞的香烟一项就值四十八亿多元
    【本报讯】盗窃国家巨额财产、坚不坦白并破坏反贪污运动的大贪污犯、贵州烟草公司会计课长郑炳琨，已被逮捕法办。
    郑犯炳琨是留用人员，他盗窃国家财产的罪恶活动，是从一九五一年一月任贵州烟草公司会计课长后开始的。仅据群众检举和初步调查，他的显著罪恶事迹，计有：
    甲、巨大的贪污活动：（一）一九五一年该公司所生产的各种牌子香烟六千四百七十二大箱，销存相抵，则有九百一十一大箱香烟没有下落。以平均单价计算合人民币四十八亿六千二百九十二万六千七百五十元之巨。（二）自一九五一年一月一日起至十二月底止，省工业厅经理科在收购材料、出售成品的转账通知单上，有百分之九十以上没有原始单据可查。会审科在“总分往来”账方面的转账也很多没有原始凭证。根据不完全统计：一九五一年全年无原始单据的转账数字，总计为人民币一百四十四亿五千八百零七万六千七百五十五元。除此而外，郑犯又涂改原始单据，进行盗窃。郑犯所接受的无原始单据的转账和涂改后的单据，初步统计为一百四十多亿元，这是郑犯勾结贵州省工商厅经理科贪污分子“四大金刚”李玉?等进行巨大贪污活动的铁证。（三）大量套购本公司的香烟。根据初步调查，一九五零年七月十日到一九五一年十月二十四日套购“模范烟”二十二点五大箱，一九五一年八月二十七日套购该公司所制“企鹅烟”十大箱，两次套购盗窃国家财产七千零二十六万八千二百二十五元。
    乙、多方破坏生产。据一九五一年一月到十一月的总计，该公司外销烟运出收回价格低于产品的成本，受损失六亿七千九百九十一万四千五百二十六元。若再加上合法利润的损失，共损失九亿七千零四十四万四千三百一十九元。因郑犯身为会计课长，根本不按照成本计算，即随意决定厂价，致使外销烟一项损失就有九亿多元（本销烟未计）。同时，郑犯与“四大金刚”勾结，对一九五一年上半年省工业厅经理科代办烟叶运到该公司后迟不转账（有的隔六个月以上），因烟叶进料价格与转账时的作价及作价时的市价（根据贵州商情最高估计）差异很大，使公司遭受六亿四千多万元的损失。由于迟不转账或迟不收款，使公司长期拖欠省工业厅经理科巨额款项，单一九五一年前六个月，多付的利息就有二亿三千五百四十三万九千三百二十五元。以上二项合计共损失人民币八亿八千一百四十五万九千八百一十五元。盗卖国家商情，也是郑犯进行贪污与破坏生产的罪恶活动之一。如一九五一年八月二十八日，贵阳市纸烟公会打电话到这个公司买烟，郑犯在电话中说香烟要跌价，并嘱他们不忙买。根据不完全统计，仅这一项使国家财产遭受的损失，估计就有五千四百五十一万元。为了掩盖其盗窃国家财产与破坏生产的严重罪行，郑犯炳琨故意打乱账目。根据初步调查，会计课的账与业务课、计划课的账都不符合，与各车间的账目也不符合。一九五一年一月至十一月制叶间所领烟叶数和郑犯账面上数目对照，郑犯账目比制叶间多出七千一百四十一斤。
    反贪污运动在贵州烟草公司热烈展开后，郑犯执迷不悟，拒不坦白；并强调“学习文化”，不许工人在学习时间开会（因郑是工会文教委员兼职工业余学校校长），硬叫职工排戏，妄图阻挠运动的开展。公司领导方面遂于一月十四日晚召开了全体职工对郑犯炳琨的斗争大会，经贵州省人民政府批准，当场由公安机关把郑犯炳琨逮捕送法院法办。
