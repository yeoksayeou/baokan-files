    [Beijing News] The Sixth District of Beijing's Austerity Inspection Committee held an anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state assets, anti-shoddy workmanship, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement conference on the 17th, attended by 1,024 households from 27 industries, including silk and cloth, Chinese medicine, watches, printing, machinery and iron industry, knitting industry, hat shops, hotels, and noodle shops. In addition to the managers and shopkeepers of the above-mentioned industrial and commercial households, worker representatives and accountants from various industries were also present.
    Li Rui, director of the Sixth District Austerity Inspection Committee, spoke first. After listing the crimes of many lawbreaking industrialists and businessmen in the district and explaining the seriousness of the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the state in the past three years, he pointed out that the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state assets, anti-shoddy workmanship, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement in the district's industrial and commercial circles has achieved great results in the past month and a half. As of now, the confession materials from the district's industrial and commercial circles have reached more than 16,000 items.
    Li Rui then pointed out that among the 1,024 industrial and commercial households present, more than 400 had no problems, while more than 600 were lawbreaking industrialists and businessmen who had committed crimes; some of them were relatively serious. However, in this movement, these industrialists and businessmen accepted the education of the People's Government and were willing to repent. Based on their confession materials, the information known by the District Austerity Inspection Committee, and the results of the study by the shop employee representatives, some of them confessed relatively well; some of them, although not completely, expressed their willingness to repent and supplement their accounts. Therefore, the District Austerity Inspection Committee, based on the instructions of the Municipal Government and the Municipal Austerity Inspection Committee, gave lenient treatment to these lawbreaking industrial and commercial households; except for those who had tax evasion violations and should pay the 1951 tax, and those who had stolen state assets, used shoddy workmanship, and other violations and should return the赃款, no fines were imposed, and criminal penalties were waived.
    Li Rui finally warned some of the industrial and commercial households present who had not yet thoroughly confessed, hoping that they would seize this opportunity, thoroughly confess the violations that had not been confessed when filling out the "Investigation and Handling Form for Lawbreaking Industrial and Commercial Households," so as to obtain lenient treatment. He emphasized that if any industrial or commercial household refuses to thoroughly account for it now, once it is found out or reported, it will be severely punished.
    Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Finance and Economics Committee, spoke on behalf of the Beijing Municipal Austerity Inspection Committee. He said that the Municipal Austerity Inspection Committee had already decided to deal with a group of lawbreaking industrial and commercial households. However, this treatment must be lenient and must satisfy people from all walks of life. Therefore, these lawbreaking industrialists and businessmen must confess and account for it more thoroughly. Cheng Hongyi then said to the lawbreaking industrialists and businessmen present that if anyone dares to continue to deceive the people and the government, they will be more severely punished if they are found out by the government or reported by the people in the future. Cheng Hongyi finally emphasized that in this movement, the broad masses of workers and shop employees have highly developed their patriotic spirit, which is worthy of praise. However, some lawbreaking industrialists and businessmen refused to confess and took confrontational and retaliatory measures against workers and shop employees, which is very wrong. Lawbreaking industrialists and businessmen should realize that it is precisely because these workers are fighting against you to promote your confession, or reporting you, that you are not getting deeper and deeper, and finally violating the law to the extent that you must be suppressed, so that you have the opportunity to be leniently treated by the government and make progress by correcting your mistakes.
    Industrial worker representative Zhao Jinming, shop employee worker representative Ya Zizhou, and light industry worker representative Xiao Ying all spoke at the meeting. They used specific examples to illustrate the fact that the bourgeoisie was rampantly attacking the working class, the government, and all the people. They pointed out that illegal capitalists used various despicable means to embezzle and steal state assets, and threatened and lured workers, trying to corrupt workers and cover up their crimes. Zhao Jinming said that many illegal capitalists win over trade union cadres, buy off workers with "more wages," and prevent other workers from knowing; or say that there is internal disunity among workers, shifting the focus of workers' struggles. Xiao Ying said that illegal capitalists threatened workers with dismissal at every turn. For example, the manager of an iron shop threatened workers by saying, "It's hard to find a three-legged toad, but there are plenty of two-legged people." Ya Zizhou said that unscrupulous merchants, in order to seek exorbitant profits, unscrupulously adulterate the goods they sell. For example, Dejucheng Seafood Store adulterates buckwheat flour in pepper powder; bean dregs in shrimp paste (5,000 catties were adulterated in 1951); sugar syrup in fungus; sesame skins in five-spice powder; and steams dried shrimp to increase moisture and weight. Another example is Zenglong Sugar Store, which adulterates red sorghum in brown sugar and potato flour in white sugar. Worker representatives all pointed out that a thorough confession is the only way out for illegal capitalists. They warned the unscrupulous merchants: "We workers have awakened, your despicable means will not work, we are not afraid of threats and enticements, if you do not thoroughly confess and bow your heads to the people, we will resolutely report you and fight you to the end."
    Mao Zhichen, Executive Committee Member of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Director of the Sixth District Federation of Industry and Commerce Office, and Manager of Wuhua Watch Store, Zhang Bingwen, Manager of Scientific Printing Bureau, and Song Qinghe, Manager of Heji Fruit Store, confessed their illegal activities on the spot. Mao Zhichen said that he had evaded more than 300 million yuan in taxes, bribed cadres with more than 4 million yuan, and illegally obtained more than 20 million yuan in windfall profits in three years. He said that when he heard the report of the volunteer representatives returning to China, he thought that the volunteers were fighting to the death on the front line, while he was evading taxes in the rear, doing things that were sorry for the people, and felt extremely ashamed. He expressed his determination to thoroughly confess, atone for his crimes, be a new person, and resolutely fight against other illegal industrial and commercial households. Zhang Bingwen confessed to the crimes of giving more than 10 million yuan in "kickbacks" to cadres of a certain organ and evading more than 200 million yuan in turnover. He said that he felt very painful and restless during the movement, and after ideological struggle, he finally confessed the problem. Song Qinghe also confessed to his illegal activities such as speculation in gold and tax evasion. He expressed his determination to correct his mistakes and start anew.
    Finally, all the lawbreaking industrialists and businessmen shouted slogans: "Thank the government for its lenient treatment!" "Thoroughly confess and be a new person!" "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    The lawbreaking industrialists and businessmen present were grateful to the government for its lenient treatment. They expressed that they would strictly abide by the country's laws in the future and guarantee that they would never engage in illegal and shameful behaviors such as bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets. After the meeting, Guan Yugeng, manager of Yixingchang Department Store, said to the workers: "This is a good way to deal with it. Not confessing is asking for trouble; confessing is much better than the 'offensive and defensive alliance.' Confessing is your own way out." Sun Guodong, manager of Gongyi Tea House, said: "It is very good for the government to deal with it so leniently, and it can also eliminate the concerns of those who have not confessed and make a thorough confession." The manager of Yihetai Cloth Store said: "After this meeting, it proves that the government does what it says, and there is only one way out: to confess. Anyone who does not confess should learn a lesson from this meeting."
    Some industrialists and businessmen who have not thoroughly confessed their illegal activities have been educated at this meeting and expressed their willingness to thoroughly confess in the future. Wang Shenzeng, manager of Ruihua Shoe Store, asked to check the accounts with the workers after returning, and checked all the goods in the warehouse that had not been accounted for in front of the workers. Jia Zigeng, manager of Quanyechang Daxin Department Store, said: "This is the last chance. If problems are found after filling out the form, you will be punished." The manager of Yuelaidian said to the shop assistants: "The government is so lenient to me, I must be a new person and account for the problem clearly."

    北京市第六区举行反行贿反偷税大会
    宽大处理坦白悔过工商户
    除补税退赃外均不罚款并免予刑事处分
    【本报讯】北京市第六区节约检查委员会于十七日举行反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动大会，到绸布、国药、钟表、印刷、机器铁工业、针织业、帽庄、旅馆、面食等二十七个行业共一千零二十四户。除上述各工商业户的经理掌柜到会外，并有各行业的工人代表和会计。
    第六区节约检查委员会主任李锐首先讲话，他在列举了该区许多违法工商业者的罪行，说明资产阶级三年来向国家猖狂进攻的严重性后，指出：该区工商界反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动，一个半月来，已获得很大成绩。截至目前止，该区工商界的坦白材料已达一万六千多件。
    李锐继又指出：到会的一千零二十四个工商户中，有四百多户是没什么问题的，此外有六百多户违法工商业者，是犯了法的；其中，有一部分还比较严重。但是，在这次运动中，这部分工商业者接受了人民政府的教育，愿意悔改。根据他们的坦白材料和区节约检查委员会所了解的情况和店员代表研究的结果，其中有一部分人坦白得比较好；有一部分人坦白得虽还不够彻底，但表示愿意悔过自新补充交代。因此，区节约检查委员会根据市政府和市节约检查委员会的指示，对于这部分违法工商业户，给予宽大处理；除有偷税漏税违法行为者应补交一九五一年税款；有盗骗国家资财、偷工减料等违法行为者应退出赃款外，均不罚款，并免予刑事处分。
    李锐最后并向到会的一部分尚未彻底坦白的工商业者提出警告，希望他们抓紧这个机会，在填写“违法工商户调查处理表”时，彻底坦白尚未交代的违法行为，以便获得宽大处理。他强调地说：如果有的工商户现在不肯彻底交代清楚，一经查出或被检举出，决予从严惩处。
    市财经委员会副主任程宏毅代表北京市节约检查委员会到会讲话。他说：市节约检查委员会是早已决定要处理一批违法工商业户的。但是，这种处理既要从宽又必须使各界人民满意。因此，必须这些违法工商业者自己坦白和交代的比较彻底才行。程宏毅继向到会的违法工商业者说：如果谁还敢继续欺骗人民和政府，以后被政府检查出来或被人民检举出来，就要加重处罚。程宏毅最后强调指出，在这次运动中，广大职工店员高度的发扬了爱国精神是值得表扬的。但有些违法工商业者拒不坦白，还对职工店员采取对抗、报复手段，这是非常错误的。违法工商业者应该认识到：正是由于这些职工向你们作斗争推动你们坦白，或检举了你们，才使你们不至于越陷越深，最后违法到非镇压不可的程度，使你们获得了被政府宽大处理的机会，使你们改过进步。
    产业工人代表赵金铭、店员工人代表亚子洲、轻工业工人代表萧英等都在大会上讲了话。他们用具体的例子说明了资产阶级向工人阶级向政府和全体人民猖狂进攻的事实。他们指出：不法资本家利用种种卑鄙手段侵吞盗骗国家的资财，并且威胁利诱工人，企图腐蚀工人和掩饰自己的罪恶。赵金铭说：许多不法资本家拉拢工会干部，用“多给工资”收买工人，不让别的工人知道；或说工人内部闹不团结，转移工人斗争目标。萧英说：不法资本家们动不动就拿解雇来威胁工人，如一家铁行的经理威胁工人说：“三条腿的蛤蟆不好找，两条腿的人有的是。”亚子洲说：奸商们为了图取暴利，就丧尽天良地在出售的货品中掺假。如德聚成海味店在胡椒面中掺荞麦面；卤虾酱中掺豆腐渣（一九五一年就掺了五千斤）；木耳掺糖稀；五香面中掺芝麻皮；还把干虾米蒸了，以便增加水分、增加分量。又如增隆糖庄在红糖里掺红高粱，白糖里掺土豆粉等。工人代表们都指出：彻底坦白是不法资本家唯一的出路。他们警告奸商们：“我们工人已经觉悟了，你们那些卑鄙手段行不通了，我们不怕威胁利诱，如果你们不彻底坦白，不向人民低头，我们就要坚决检举你们，和你们斗争到底。”
    市工商联执行委员、第六区工商联办事处副主任、五华钟表行经理毛质宸，科学印刷局经理张炳文，合记果店经理宋清河等，当场坦白了他们的不法行为。毛质宸说：他在三年中曾偷漏税款三亿多元，向干部行贿四百多万元，并非法获取暴利两千多万元。他说：当他听到志愿军回国代表的报告时，想到志愿军在前线出生入死地作战，而自己却在后方偷税，作对不起人民的事，感到万分惭愧。他表示要决心彻底坦白，立功赎罪，重新做人，并向其他不法工商户作坚决斗争。张炳文坦白了曾给某机关干部一千多万元的“回扣”，偷漏流水额两亿多元等罪行。他说他在运动中感到非常痛苦，坐卧不安，经过思想斗争，最后把问题交代出来。宋清河也坦白了他倒卖黄金和偷税等不法行为。他表示一定要改过自新。
    最后，全体不法工商业者高呼口号：“感谢政府宽大处理！”“彻底坦白，重新作人！”“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”
    到会的违法工商业者都感激政府对他们的宽大处理。表示今后一定严守国家的法律，保证决不再有行贿、偷税、盗骗国家资财等犯法的和可耻的行为。会后，仪兴昌百货店经理关毓赓向工人说：“这样处理好，不交代就是自己找苦吃；坦白比‘攻守同盟’好得多，坦白就是自己的出路。”公益茶庄经理孙国栋说：“政府这样宽大处理，很好，还能使没有坦白的消除顾虑，彻底坦白。”义和泰布庄经理说：“经过这次会，证明了政府说到那里，就做到那里，说一不二，只有坦白，才是出路。凡不坦白的人应该这次会中得到教训。”
    有些尚未彻底坦白自己不法行为的工商业者，在这次会上受到了教育，今后表示愿意彻底坦白。瑞华鞋店经理王慎增回去后要求与工人一起查账，并当着工人的面，把仓库所有未走账的货都点清。劝业场大新百货店经理贾子耕说：这是最后一个机会。填表后再检查出问题来，就要受处分。悦来店经理向店员说：政府对我这样宽大，我一定要重新作人，把问题交代清楚。
