    Local Newspapers Should Concentrate Firepower to Repel the Bourgeoisie's Attack

    The central task of newspapers in various localities at present is to promote the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement forward, and to concentrate firepower to strike at the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie.

    According to a review of the newspapers from the five major administrative regions (Shanghai *Liberation Daily*, Hankou *Changjiang Daily*, Xi'an *Masses Daily*, Chongqing *Xinhua Daily*, and Shenyang *Northeast Daily*) and the Tianjin *Daily*, from January 1st to January 30th (Chongqing *Xinhua Daily* up to the 21st), these newspapers have achieved initial success in implementing this policy. In the first half of January, the newspapers successively reported that the Party and government organs of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities, as well as state-owned enterprises, had launched large-scale, vigorous anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movements. They disseminated the experiences of leaders taking the lead, conducting layer-by-layer reviews, mobilizing the masses for democratic inspections, and encouraging confessions and denunciations. They also criticized and struck at the erroneous tendencies of some personnel within the organizations who suppressed democracy, resisted the movement, and abandoned class struggle. From mid-January onwards, the newspapers began to report on the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence launched by the industrial and commercial sectors in major cities. They also exposed the criminal acts of some illegal industrialists and merchants. The Tianjin *Daily* published two consecutive editorials on the 15th and 16th to this effect, which, in addition to calling on the industrial and commercial sectors to participate in this movement, severely refuted the various fallacies issued by some illegal industrialists and merchants to resist the movement, and warned those illegal industrialists and merchants who attempted to openly resist and evade responsibility for their crimes. Since the 18th, the Shanghai *Liberation Daily* successively reported on the massive momentum of shop assistants in Shanghai and major cities in East China being mobilized to denounce illegal industrialists and merchants, and resolutely struck at the capitalists' conspiracies to obstruct the denunciation movement through threats and inducements. The newspapers also did a lot of work in mobilizing the masses to denounce corruption and bribery. The Xi'an *Masses Daily* opened special columns in the "Letters from Readers" section such as "Everyone Denounces Corruption and Waste" and "Everyone Denounces Corruption and Bribery" to support the mass denunciation movement. In addition, secret reporting boxes and reader reception rooms were set up to organize mass denunciations. Through the above methods, readers have denounced many cases of corruption and waste. The Hankou *Changjiang Daily* also used the same method to mobilize readers to denounce, and readers denounced the important case of the major corrupt official Sun Baosheng colluding with unscrupulous merchants for malpractice. The Chongqing *Xinhua Daily* has a column on the front page called "Everyone Denounces Corrupt Elements" and occasionally publishes reader letters in important positions on the front page, exposing the corruption, waste, and bureaucracy of some responsible cadres. In order to provide ideological guidance to the masses in the movement, the "Ideological Miscellany" column of the Hankou *Changjiang Daily* used short and powerful texts to criticize various erroneous understandings and help the masses dispel ideological concerns about confession and denunciation. The Chongqing *Xinhua Daily* has a special column on the second page dedicated to exposing and attacking the words and deeds that obstruct the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, in order to encourage the fighting spirit of the masses. The Shanghai *Liberation Daily*, through the Wang Canwen corruption case and the first warehouse's mildewed materials incident, continuously organized reader discussions, and published more than 40 related articles. This method of mass self-education powerfully criticized the corrupt thoughts and styles of the bourgeoisie. In order to expose the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets offensive and expose the despicable means they used in the offensive, the Shenyang *Northeast Daily*'s "How a Scoundrel Merchant Framed Me" and the Tianjin *Daily*'s "How I Was Inducted into Corruption and Degradation Under the Enticement of a Scoundrel Merchant" and other communications all specifically illustrated that the corruption and degeneration of state cadres was the result of the bourgeoisie's ideological erosion, and also pointed out the serious danger of this corrupting ideological erosion.

    Although the newspapers have done the above-mentioned work in attacking the bourgeoisie’s offensive, all these newspapers have not been fierce enough in their propaganda firepower in this serious class struggle, especially in exposing and criticizing the corrupt and decadent side of the bourgeoisie and its erosive effect, and the attack is still very incomplete. In the past month, although most newspapers have exposed one or two major corruption cases, such as the corruption case of Lan Yongmin, manager of the Tiexi Branch of the Northeast Veterans Engineering Company, disclosed by the Shenyang *Northeast Daily* on January 30th, the case of the corrupt and degenerate element Yi Jiguang exposed by the Hankou *Changjiang Daily*, the corruption and waste case of the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company published by the Shanghai *Liberation Daily*... etc.; however, most of them are sporadic, not systematically and with emphasis on vividly pointing out the bourgeoisie’s offensive from exposing major corruption cases, exposing the serious crimes of major corrupt officials and illegal capitalists, and repeatedly educating the people with this. This is certainly related to the actual situation in the early stages of the movement, but newspapers often do not report specifically or vividly enough on major corrupt officials who have already emerged and have been caught in various localities. As for exposing the criminal acts of illegal industrialists and merchants and criticizing their conspiracies and fallacies to resist the movement, it is still not forceful enough. In the Shanghai *Liberation Daily*'s January 15th editorial calling on the industrial and commercial sectors to launch a movement against bribery, tax evasion, profiteering, and fraud, there was no frontal criticism of the illegal acts of local industrialists and merchants or their dishonest attitude towards the movement. The Shenyang *Northeast Daily* took the lead in launching the anti-corruption and degeneration movement as early as last September, ahead of other regions; however, in the recent anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, it has not yet achieved a large-scale momentum. Some reports published in the *Northeast Daily* contain more minor matters and fewer major matters, and some major corruption cases that have been discovered have not yet been formally reported.

    Local newspapers should play a greater guiding role and more forcefully attack the bourgeoisie’s offensive. In future propaganda, first of all, they must cooperate with the new upsurge of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, and concentrate their efforts to expose those major corruption cases and the serious crimes of those major corrupt officials. These major corrupt officials not only stole a large amount of state property and wasted and squandered it in their lives, but also used this property to do business in partnership with private merchants, and engaged in various illegal activities such as speculation, smuggling, and tax evasion. They used the power of state staff to steal state economic intelligence, embezzle state funds, illegally obtain transportation conveniences, and collude with unscrupulous merchants to engage in various malpractices. Local newspapers must seize these facts to illustrate the serious harm of major corrupt officials to the country's economic undertakings. They must also use concrete facts to point out that these major corrupt officials are the agents of illegal capitalists. Some of them are sent by capitalists to our interior, and some of them are pulled from our interior to their side by illegal capitalists. Precisely for this reason, these major corrupt elements have become our country's and people's most dangerous enemies on the economic front, causing serious losses to our country's economic undertakings. Newspapers must put these most typical and vivid facts before the masses to shock them and create a broad social opinion that hates and resents corruption crimes. Only in this way can we truly mobilize the masses, unite as one, encircle and pursue major corrupt officials, and thoroughly destroy the fortresses - large and small corrupt elements - built by illegal capitalists within us. Secondly, we must also constantly denounce the various fallacies spread by illegal capitalists. Now they are spreading a new argument, which is the argument that Bo Yibo criticized in his speech at the Beijing Public Trial of Major Corrupt Officials on February 1, that the bourgeoisie cannot be said to have launched an offensive against the working class and the Communist Party. Local newspapers should not only refute this absurd argument with conclusive evidence, but should also point out with a very serious attitude the danger of the bourgeoisie’s offensive to the country and the people. If this offensive is not resolutely repelled, it will not only cause huge losses to state property, but also cause the Chinese revolution to suffer defeat. All patriotic people should unite and, under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party, repel the bourgeoisie’s offensive. This is a serious political task for the people of the whole country at present. Thirdly, newspapers should also pay attention to publicizing and explaining policies to the masses according to the development of the movement in various localities. Not only should we generally explain our policies towards corrupt officials and illegal industrialists and merchants, but we should also focus on publicizing and explaining policies with examples, and use the various different treatments of corrupt officials and illegal industrialists and merchants by the people's government to educate the broad masses, while at the same time pointing out the way out for corrupt officials and illegal industrialists and merchants. We must timely and forcefully publicize and explain our firm measures to resolutely adopt arrest and legal action against certain corrupt officials and scoundrel merchants who have committed heinous crimes and refuse to confess; at the same time, publicize and explain our policy of leniency towards certain corrupt officials and scoundrel merchants who have committed serious crimes but are willing to thoroughly confess. Because only in this way can we comprehensively reflect the policies of the Party and the people's government, isolate and strike at the most heinous elements, and thereby more forcefully promote the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement forward. Finally, local newspapers should conduct a full patriotic education among the broad masses of people in the propaganda of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. Not only should we generally explain that reporting corruption and waste is a patriotic act, and therefore it is the responsibility of all patriots; but we should also use examples of the patriotic actions of the masses in the movement to educate the masses themselves, improve the awareness of the masses, and make them further recognize the brave and hardworking Chinese working people, recognize the Chinese working class that leads the Chinese revolution to victory, recognize the glorious, correct and great Chinese Communist Party, recognize the most lovable Chinese People's Volunteers and the People's Liberation Army, recognize the Central People's Government with its high prestige, recognize the socialist state-owned economy, recognize the bright future of our great motherland, and establish a correct and truly patriotic attitude towards labor, towards state property, and towards the country and the people's various construction undertakings. These are the responsibilities that local newspapers must shoulder in this serious political struggle.

### 各地报纸应该集中火力打退资产阶级的进攻

    各地报纸应该集中火力打退资产阶级的进攻
    目前各地报纸的中心任务是推动反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动向前发展，集中火力打击资产阶级的猖狂进攻。
    根据对五大行政区的报纸（上海解放日报、汉口长江日报、西安群众日报、重庆新华日报、沈阳东北日报）及天津日报的检查，从一月一日至三十日（重庆新华日报至二十一日），各报在贯彻执行这个方针方面已经取得了初步成绩。一月上半月各报都先后报道了各大行政区、省、市党政机关及各地国家企业机关开始大张旗鼓、雷厉风行地发动反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，传播了首长带头、层层检讨、发动群众进行民主检查和动员坦白检举的经验；也批评和打击了机关内部某些人员压制民主、抵抗运动和放弃阶级斗争的错误倾向。从一月中旬以后，各报又开始报道各大城市工商界开展反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报的运动；并揭露了一些不法工商业者的犯罪行为。天津日报曾为此在十五日和十六日连续发表两篇社论，除号召工商界参加这个运动外，又严厉地驳斥了某些不法工商业者为抗拒运动所发出的种种谬论，向那些企图公开抵抗和逃避罪责的不法工商业者提出警告。华东解放日报自十八日以后先后报道了上海和华东各大城市的店员动员起来检举不法工商业者的浩大声势，坚决打击了资本家用威胁利诱手段阻挠检举运动的阴谋。在发动社会群众检举贪污、行贿方面，各报纸也做了许多工作。西安群众日报在“读者来信”栏内辟有“人人检举贪污浪费”、“人人检举贪污行贿”专栏，以支持群众的检举运动。另外还设有密告箱和读者接待室以组织群众检举。经过上述方法，读者已检举了很多贪污浪费的事件。汉口长江日报也用同样的办法发动读者检举，曾由读者检举出大贪污犯孙宝生和奸商勾结舞弊的重要案件。重庆新华日报在第一版设有“人人都来检举贪污分子”专栏，并有时在第一版重要地位发表读者信件，揭发某些负责干部的贪污、浪费和官僚主义。为了在运动中对群众进行思想指导，汉口长江日报的“思想杂谈”一栏，用短小有力的文字批评各种错误认识，帮助群众解除坦白检举的思想顾虑。重庆新华日报在二版设有专栏，专门揭露和打击阻挠反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的言论和行动，以鼓励群众的斗志。上海解放日报通过王灿文贪污案件和第一仓库物资霉烂事件，连续组织读者讨论，先后登载有关文章达四十多篇。这种群众自我教育的方法，有力地批判了资产阶级的腐败思想和作风。为了揭露资产阶级的糖弹进攻，并揭穿他们在进攻中所用的卑鄙手段，沈阳东北日报发表的“奸商怎样陷害了我”、天津日报发表的“我怎样在奸商的引诱下走上了腐化堕落的道路”等通讯，都具体说明国家干部的贪污腐化是资产阶级思想侵蚀的结果，也指明了这种腐败思想侵蚀的严重危险性。
    虽然各报在打击资产阶级进攻中，已经做了上面所说的工作，但是，所有这些报纸在这场严重的阶级斗争中，宣传的火力还不够猛烈，特别是对于资产阶级腐败堕落的一面及其侵蚀作用，揭发批判还不够，打击还很不彻底。在过去这一个月中，虽然多数报纸已经揭露过一两个大的贪污案件，如沈阳东北日报在一月三十日所披露的东北荣军工程公司铁西分公司经理蓝拥民的贪污案件，汉口长江日报揭发的腐化堕落分子易吉光的案件，上海解放日报发表的山东省建筑工程公司的贪污浪费案件……等；然而大多是零星的，不是有系统地有重点地从揭露大贪污案件中生动地指出资产阶级的进攻，暴露大贪污犯和不法资本家的深重罪恶，并以此反复地去教育人民群众。这固然和运动初期的实际状况有关系，但对各地已经露头和已经被捉到的大贪污犯，报纸也往往报道得不够具体、不够生动。至于揭露不法工商业者的犯罪行为，指斥他们抗拒运动的阴谋和谬论，还表现得不够有力。上海解放日报一月十五日号召工商界开展反行贿、反偷漏、反暴利、反欺诈运动的社论中，对于当地工商业者的不法行为，对于他们对待运动的不老实的态度还根本没有正面的批驳。沈阳东北日报去年九月就提出了反对贪污蜕化运动，走在各地的前面；但是在最近时期的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，却还没有做到大张旗鼓的地步。在东北日报上发表的一些报道中，小事多，大事少，某些已经发现的大贪污案件尚无正式报道。
    各地报纸要更加发挥指导作用，更有力地打击资产阶级的进攻，在今后的宣传中，首先，必须配合反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动新的高涨，集中力量来揭发那些大的贪污案件，揭露那些大贪污犯的严重罪行。那些大贪污犯不仅是在盗窃国家大量财产以后，在生活上浪费挥霍、腐化堕落，而且又利用这些财产去和私商合伙做生意，并进行投机倒把、走私漏税等各种非法活动。他们利用国家工作人员的职权，盗窃国家经济情报，盗用国家资金，并非法取得交通运输上的便利，和奸商共同进行种种营私舞弊的勾当。各地报纸必须抓住这些事实来说明大贪污犯对国家经济事业的严重危害性。还要用具体事实指出，这些大贪污犯就是不法资本家的代理人，他们有的是资本家派到我们内部来的，有的是不法资本家从我们内部拉到他们那边去的。正因为这个缘故，这些大贪污分子已经成为我们国家和人民在经济战线上的最危险的敌人，造成了我们国家经济事业的严重损失。各报必须把这类最典型的活生生的事实摆在群众面前，使群众触目惊心，造成仇视和愤恨贪污罪行的广泛的社会舆论。只有这样，才能真正把群众动员起来，团结一致，围剿和追击大贪污犯，把不法资本家在我们内部所建筑的堡垒——大小贪污分子——彻底摧毁。其次，还必须不断地痛斥不法资本家所散布的各种谬论。现在他们正在散布着一种新的论调，这就是薄一波同志在二月一日北京公审大贪污犯大会上的讲话中所指斥的那种论调，即是说资产阶级根本谈不到对工人阶级和共产党发动进攻。各地报纸不仅要用证据确凿的事实来驳斥这个荒谬的论调，而且应该用十分严肃的态度指出资产阶级的进攻对国家和人民的危险性，如果不坚决打退这个进攻，不仅要使国家财产遭受巨大的损失，而且会使中国革命遭受失败。一切爱国的人民都应该团结起来，在工人阶级和共产党的领导下，打退资产阶级进攻。这是全国人民当前的一个严重的政治任务。再次，各报还应注意根据各地运动的发展，向群众宣传解释政策。不仅要一般地说明我们对贪污分子和不法工商业者的政策，而且要着重用实例来宣传解释政策，用人民政府对贪污分子和不法工商业者的各种不同的处置，来教育广大群众，同时向贪污分子和不法工商业者指明出路。必须及时地有力地宣传解释我们对某些罪大恶极、拒不坦白的贪污犯和奸商坚决采取逮捕法办的严厉措施；同时，宣传解释我们对于某些虽然犯有严重罪行而肯彻底坦白的贪污犯和奸商采取从宽处理的方针。因为只有这样，才能全面地反映党和人民政府的政策，孤立并打击罪大恶极的分子，从而更有力地推动反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动向前发展。最后，各地报纸要在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的宣传中，应对广大人民群众进行充分的爱国主义的教育。不仅一般地说明检举贪污浪费是爱国的行为，因而也就是一切爱国者的责任；而且要以群众在运动中的爱国行为的实例，来教育群众自己，提高群众的觉悟，使他们进一步认识勇敢勤劳的中国劳动人民，认识领导中国革命走向胜利的中国工人阶级，认识光荣正确伟大的中国共产党，认识最可爱的中国人民志愿军和人民解放军，认识有崇高威信的中央人民政府，认识社会主义性质的国营经济，认识我们伟大祖国的光明前途，并树立对待劳动、对待国家财产、对待国家和人民的各种建设事业的正确的真正爱国主义态度。这些，就是各地报纸在这一严重政治斗争中必须担当起来的责任。
