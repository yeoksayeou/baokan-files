    (II) The American Aggressors Will Never Escape the Sanctions of Justice
    The crimes of large-scale killing and abuse of our captured personnel by the American aggressors have reached the extreme of brutality. Today's Xinhua News Agency report once again fully exposes the heinous crimes of the American aggressors. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate this insane and inhumane atrocity of the American aggressors; the just people of the world should see even more clearly the bestial face of the American aggressors from these facts, and unite to resolutely strike at them!
    From the beginning of the Korean War until now, the facts of large-scale killing and abuse of our captured personnel by the American aggressors on the battlefield and in prisoner-of-war camps are too numerous to mention. The American aggressor troops were ordered not to accept prisoners sporadically on the battlefield, and often killed our captured personnel on the spot. In many prisoner-of-war camps in South Korea, more than 17,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army were killed in the first ten months of last year. The American aggressors, who are fond of killing, are no different from the former Hitler Germany and Japanese fascists in their brutal acts of killing and abusing our captured personnel.
    According to the Korean People's Army soldiers who escaped from the American aggressor's prisoner-of-war camps, the American aggressors often used tortures on our captured personnel, including: filling their mouths with gasoline and setting them on fire; blinding their eyes with strong electric light; forcibly stripping off their fingernails; branding their bodies with red-hot iron bars; and dragging them to the wild to be shot as moving targets, etc. The American aggressors were even more shameless in their treatment of women among our captured personnel, often raping them, cutting off their breasts, and chopping off their hands and feet; or pouring gasoline on them and burning them alive. In the American prisoner-of-war camp in Suwon, there were "special prisons" with dark, sunless piles of rotting corpses, "special torture rooms" dedicated to various kinds of torture, "special jails" where large numbers of poisonous mosquitoes were raised, and so-called "steam prisons," where prisoners were locked in wooden cabinets to be steamed to death. This inhumane and bestial behavior of the American aggressor army has made Osborne, a war correspondent in Korea for the extremely reactionary American magazines "Life" and "Happiness," admit that the American invasion of Korea was an "ugly war" and "the most barbaric action."
    In the U.S. military hospitals in Japan, the American aggressors dissected and researched living captured personnel from our side and conducted bacterial experiments. In March of last year, Sims, the director of the "Public Health Bureau" of the U.S. Aggressor Army Headquarters, commanded 38 American "scientific personnel" to use our captured personnel for bacterial weapons experiments on bacterial landing craft No. 1091. War criminal Sims was awarded the "Cross Medal" by the U.S. government for this reason. Foreign news agencies and a U.S. Air Force man named Dawson also confirmed that there was a mysterious ship off the south coast of Korea, where a large number of various bacteria were cultivated, which was specifically used to test bacterial weapons on our captured personnel. In August of last year, the American aggressors used a 14,000-ton British ship to transport 1,000 Korean and Vietnamese prisoners to the West for atomic explosion experiments. In addition to planning to directly kill our captured personnel, the American aggressors also deliberately allowed diseases to spread in the prisoner-of-war camps. This happened in the prisoner-of-war camp on Geoje Island.
    Now, we see again that the American aggressors are not only physically torturing and killing our captured personnel, but also using more vile and insidious means to force our captured personnel to tattoo reactionary slogans on their bodies, force them to undergo fascist education, and force them to join the so-called "Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps," in an attempt to poison our captured personnel spiritually and ideologically.
    The American aggressors used these extremely shameless means against our captured personnel at a time when the fourth item on the agenda of the Korean armistice talks was discussing the arrangements for prisoners of war on both sides. Obviously, the American aggressors are attempting to use the evil activities of abuse, humiliation, killing and forced fascist education to achieve the despicable goal of detaining a large number of our captured personnel and sending them to the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan and the Syngman Rhee bandit gang in South Korea. The American aggressors attempted to anesthetize and poison our captured personnel with fascist education on the one hand, and to coerce them with despicable and dirty means on the other, so as not to let them return to their motherland after the armistice is realized. In the meetings of the fourth item on the agenda, the U.S. side has stubbornly insisted on the so-called "voluntary repatriation" scheme, which has long been refuted by our side, and refused the reasonable principle of unconditional release and repatriation of all captured personnel on both sides proposed by our side. The real reason why the fourth item on the agenda has been delayed until now is here. However, we can assert that the "voluntary repatriation" conspiracy tricks played by the American aggressors are bound to be shamefully defeated. In the meetings of the fourth item on the agenda, the only excuse for the American aggressors to insist on the absurd proposition of "voluntary repatriation" is the so-called "respect" for the "personal will" of the captured personnel. However, as long as the people of the world look at the dark and sunless facts in the American prisoner-of-war camps in Geoje Island and other places, they will understand that under the brutal and despicable bloody hands of the American aggressors, how can the personal will of our captured personnel be expressed? Only by realizing the principle of unconditional release and repatriation of all prisoners of war on both sides after the signing and entry into force of the armistice agreement proposed by our side can we truly respect the personal will of the captured personnel on both sides; only in this way can the fourth item on the agenda be resolved. Today, the only urgent personal will of the captured personnel of the warring parties is to demand the rapid success of the armistice negotiations, to unconditionally release and repatriate them, to reunite with their long-separated and worried families, and to restore their peaceful life.
    As is known to all, contrary to the American aggressors, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army pursued a lenient policy of revolutionary humanitarianism towards prisoners of war, and even the American and British prisoners of war who have been released or have not been released admitted that the prisoner-of-war camps of the Korean-Chinese People's Army "are the best prisoner-of-war camps in the world." In the discussion of the fourth item on the agenda, the Korean-Chinese side has consistently expressed our infinite sympathy and concern for the captured personnel on both sides and their families, and has consistently expressed our sincere desire to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. However, the American aggressors have adopted a completely different attitude from our side, which has delayed the entire armistice negotiations for more than seven months, and the fourth item on the agenda has been delayed for more than two months without reaching an agreement. The American aggressors not only abused, humiliated and arbitrarily killed captured personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, but also showed no human sympathy to American prisoners of war and their families. What the American aggressors hope to get is to continue the war of aggression and continue to expand the war profits of the big capitalists on Wall Street. Therefore, the American aggressors must bear full responsibility for delaying the negotiations, and must bear full responsibility for the heinous crimes of abusing, humiliating and arbitrarily killing our captured personnel. These evil conspiracies of the American aggressors will never escape the just sanctions of the people of the world!

### （二）美国侵略者决逃不脱正义的制裁

    （二）美国侵略者决逃不脱正义的制裁
    美国侵略者大规模残杀和虐待我方被俘人员的罪行，已经达到了残暴的极点。今天新华社的报道，再一次充分揭露了美国侵略者的这种令人发指的罪恶行为。对于美国侵略者这种疯狂的灭绝人性的暴行，中国人民是绝对不能容忍的；全世界正义的人民，都应该从这些事实中，更进一步看清美国侵略者的禽兽面目，一致起来坚决予以打击！
    从朝鲜战争初期直到现在，美国侵略者在战场上和俘虏营里大规模残杀和虐待我方被俘人员的事实是罄竹难书的。美国侵略军奉命在战场上不准零星收容俘虏，对我方被俘人员往往就地加以杀害。在南朝鲜的许多俘虏营里，在去年的头十个月中，就有一万七千多名朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军的被俘人员遭到残杀。嗜杀成性的美国侵略者残杀和虐待我方被俘人员的暴行，比起过去的希特勒德国和日本法西斯，并无二致。
    据从美国侵略军俘虏营逃回的朝鲜人民军战士说，美国侵略者对待我方被俘人员经常使用的毒刑有：在口中灌满汽油，点火燃烧；用强烈的电光射瞎眼睛；强迫剥去指甲；用烧红的铁条烙人身体；拉到野外当活动靶子加以射杀等等。美国侵略者对待我方被俘人员中的妇女则更加无耻，往往把她们强奸后，割去乳房，剁掉手足；或者在她们身上浇上汽油，活活地烧死。在水原的美方俘虏营里，有堆积着腐烂尸体的暗无天日的“特别监狱”，有专门进行各种严刑拷打的“特刑室”，有养着大量有毒蚊子的“特别监”，还有所谓“蒸气监”，就是把俘虏关在木柜子里活活蒸死。美国侵略军的这种灭绝人性的野兽行为，使得反动透顶的美国“生活”和“幸福”杂志驻朝鲜的战地记者奥斯本，也不得不承认美国侵略朝鲜是一场“丑恶的战争”和“最野蛮的行动”。
    在日本的美军医院里，美国侵略者把活着的我方被俘人员作解剖研究和细菌实验。在去年三月间，美国侵略军总部“公共卫生局”局长赛姆斯指挥三十八个美国“科学人员”，在一○九一号细菌登陆艇上，用我方被俘人员作细菌武器的试验。战争罪犯赛姆斯因此曾得到了美国政府的“十字勋章”。外国通讯社和一个名叫道逊的美国空军人员，也证实在朝鲜的南海岸，有一只神秘的船，这只船上培殖着大量的各种细菌，就是专门用来对我方被俘人员作细菌武器的试验的。在去年八月间，美国侵略者曾用一艘一万四千吨的英国轮船，从亚洲运送一千名朝鲜、越南的俘虏到西方去作原子爆炸的试验。美国侵略者除了有计划地直接杀害我方被俘人员外，还故意使俘虏营里疾病蔓延。在巨济岛的俘虏营里便曾发生过这种情形。
    现在，我们又看到，美国侵略者不仅在肉体上摧残和杀害我方被俘人员，还在用更卑鄙恶毒的手段，强迫在我方被俘人员身上刺反动口号，强迫进行法西斯教育，强迫参加所谓“反共救国团”，妄图从精神上、思想上毒害我方被俘人员。
    美国侵略者对我方被俘人员施用这种极端无耻的手段，是在朝鲜停战谈判第四项议程讨论关于双方俘虏的安排问题的时候。很显然的，美国侵略者妄图用虐待、侮辱、残杀和强迫进行法西斯教育的罪恶活动，来达到扣留我方大批被俘人员，送交台湾国民党残匪和南朝鲜李承晚匪帮的卑鄙目的。美国侵略者企图一方面用法西斯教育麻醉毒害我方被俘人员，一方面用卑鄙污浊的手段胁迫他们，不让他们在停战实现后回到自己的祖国来。在第四项议程的会议中，美方始终顽固地坚持早已被我方驳得体无完肤的所谓“自愿遣返”的方案，拒绝我方所提出的无条件释放和遣返双方全体被俘人员的合理原则。第四项议程之所以一直被拖延到现在还不能解决，其真正的原因就在这里。但是，我们可以断言，美国侵略者所玩弄的这种“自愿遣返”的阴谋伎俩，是必定会遭到可耻的失败的。在第四项议程的会议上，美国侵略者固执“自愿遣返”这个荒谬主张的唯一藉口，是所谓“尊重”被俘人员“个人的意志”。但是，全世界人民只要看看巨济岛等地美方俘虏营里的暗无天日的事实，就会明白在美国侵略者这样凶残和卑劣的血手笼罩之下，我方被俘人员的个人意志有何方法可以表达出来？只有实现了我方所提出的停战协定签字生效后无条件释放和遣返双方全体战俘的原则，才是真正尊重双方被俘人员个人的意志；也只有这样，才使第四项议程有解决的可能。今天作战双方的被俘人员的唯一迫切的个人意志，就是要求停战谈判迅速成功，无条件释放和遣返他们，和他们久别而悬念的亲人们团聚，恢复他们的和平生活。
    举世周知，和美国侵略者相反，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军对战俘是奉行革命人道主义的宽待政策的，就是已经获释或还没有获释的美英战俘，也承认朝中人民部队的战俘营“是世界上最好的战俘营”。在第四项议程的讨论中，朝中方面一贯表示了我方对于双方被俘人员和他们的家属的无限同情和关怀，一贯表示了我方和平解决朝鲜问题的真诚愿望。可是美国侵略者却采取了和我方完全不同的态度，这就使得整个停战谈判拖延七个多月之久，第四项议程也拖延了两个多月不能取得协议。美国侵略者不仅对朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军被俘人员百般虐待、侮辱和任意残杀；就是对美国战俘们及其家属，也毫无人类的同情心。美国侵略者所希望得到的，仍然是继续进行侵略战争，继续扩大华尔街大资本家的战争利润。因此，美国侵略者必须对拖延谈判负完全的责任，必须对虐待、侮辱和任意残杀我方被俘人员的灭绝人性的滔天罪行负完全的责任。美国侵略者的这些罪恶阴谋，决逃不脱世界人民的正义制裁！
