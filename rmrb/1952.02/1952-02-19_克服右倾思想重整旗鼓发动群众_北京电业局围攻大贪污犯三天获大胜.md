Overcoming Right-Leaning Thought, Reorganizing Forces and Mobilizing the Masses
Beijing Electric Power Bureau Wins a Great Victory After Three Days of Besieging Major Embezzlers

    Having overcome right-leaning thought, reorganized forces, and mobilized the masses, leading cadres of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau besieged major embezzlers and quickly achieved results, winning a great victory in three days.
    Before 1950, more than a dozen embezzlement cases were successively discovered in the power supply, management, and sales departments of the Electric Power Bureau, which once drew the attention of leading cadres. However, in this anti-corruption struggle, the leading cadres, due to insufficient understanding of the seriousness of the bourgeoisie's attack, and due to overestimating the achievements of employee education, developed complacency. After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement on December 24 last year, the masses quickly mobilized. However, some comrades of the General Branch Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of the Electric Power Bureau believed that more than a dozen embezzlement cases had been handled in mass rallies in the past, the masses had been educated, and the thinking of the comrades who were working in these departments at that time had fluctuated, requesting transfers. Therefore, they concluded: "Even if there is corruption in the Electric Power Bureau, it will not be too serious; there may be misappropriation of public funds, but there will be no embezzlement of more than 100 million yuan." In fact, the chief and deputy chiefs of the Materials Section were both "big tigers." After the movement started, they resisted passively, neither mobilizing the masses nor confessing. However, the leading cadres of the Electric Power Bureau believed that the Materials Section had been completely reorganized in 1950 due to embezzlement cases, and the chief and deputy chiefs were both Communist Party members, so there would be no major problems; therefore, they adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards them. Even when the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to remove them from their posts based on the materials, some leading cadres of the Electric Power Bureau were still hesitant, fearing that they would "wrong good people," and allowed them to act freely, so they were able to collude with private merchants to coordinate their statements. Under these circumstances, after some small embezzlers confessed or were reported, some people were satisfied with the small achievements that had been made. When the focus of the movement turned to major embezzlers, the leading cadres lost confidence and determination. Wang Dianqing and Meng Qingzhu, after being reported and struggled against by the masses, once admitted to colluding with unscrupulous merchants and accepting bribes for embezzlement, but after a few days, they denied their confessions, saying that they were forced to admit it. Under the stubborn resistance of the major embezzlers, the leading cadres wavered, fearing that they would "make a mistake and be unable to step down." They even felt that the information they had found from checking accounts was not enough to rely on. Therefore, before the Spring Festival, although the "tiger"-hunting team had been organized, the leading cadres remained inactive, causing the movement to temporarily stagnate.
    This situation began to change after the Spring Festival. According to the instructions of the Municipal Committee, the General Branch Committee criticized right-leaning thought, and based on preliminary analysis, proposed a guaranteed number of "tigers" to be caught. They reorganized their forces and organized four "volunteer tiger-hunting teams" in the power supply, management, and sales departments, led by the Party committees and Communist Youth League committees of each department. Starting on February 4, they launched the first siege of the embezzlers. On the first night, the sales department captured the major embezzler Tan Weiyi; in the following two days, the management department and the power supply department captured major embezzlers such as Shi Guiquan, Li Zhong, and Wei Yuxiang.
    This victory thoroughly eliminated the right-leaning thought of the leading cadres and greatly increased the courage and confidence of the employees in capturing major embezzlers. Originally, the leading cadres underestimated the situation of these embezzlers, treating them as "small tigers" or "medium tigers." But in reality, they were all "big tigers," and some had become capitalists. For example, Tan Weiyi (meter reader of the Nancheng Sales Station), who was considered a "medium tiger" by the leading cadres, was a bureaucrat in the Kuomintang era. In the early days of liberation, he used his position to collude with unscrupulous merchants, helping private merchants steal electricity by reporting installation and transfer of meters and reverse metering, embezzling from it. After he was transferred to the Changxindian Sales Station, he colluded with a certain electrical materials store, introducing contracting, so that the electrical materials store could reap huge profits. Under the mass reports and the siege of the "tiger-hunting team," he admitted in just two hours that he had invested in an electrical materials store, reversed more than forty meters, and undercalculated pole and line fees for electricity users, embezzling 127 million yuan from it. Another example is Shi Guiquan and Li Zhong, who were considered "small tigers" by the leading cadres. In the early days of liberation, they were electricians at the Jingmen Sales Office in Mentougou, using their positions to hang lines and throw meters for the Beiying Coal Mine, stealing electricity, and taking bribes from each coal mine every month. In February and March of 1949, they each received 10,000 to 20,000 catties of millet in bribes every month. Some coal mines even had shares in them. They once caused the country to suffer a loss of 1 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. Under the fierce siege of the masses, they quickly admitted that almost all the small coal mines in Mentougou had colluded with them to steal electricity, and some had even stolen equipment; Shi Guiquan embezzled more than 150 million yuan in total; Li Zhong embezzled more than 420 million yuan.
    The eyes of the leading cadres and employees are bright. They initially estimate that 10 million kilowatt-hours of electricity were stolen from 1949 to 1950. If a quarter of it was embezzled, then 2 billion yuan was embezzled, and there is a lot to be done in it. They are pressing on the attack while riding on the victory.

    克服右倾思想重整旗鼓发动群众
    北京电业局围攻大贪污犯三天获大胜
    北京市电业局领导干部克服右倾思想，重整旗鼓，发动群众，围剿大贪污犯，迅速取得了成绩，在三天之内，打了一个大胜仗。
    一九五○年以前，电业局的供电、管理、营业等部门，曾陆续发现十几起贪污案，一度引起领导干部的注意。但领导干部在这次反贪污的斗争中，由于对资产阶级进攻的严重性认识不足，由于过高估计了职工教育的成绩，产生了麻痹思想。去年十二月二十四日开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动以后，群众很快就发动起来。但电业局的中共总支委员会有些同志却认为：过去曾经在群众大会上处理了十几件贪污案，群众受到了教育，并且当时在这些部门工作的同志的思想都波动了，要求调动工作。因此，他们得出结论说：“电业局即使有贪污，也不会太严重；挪用公款的可能有，贪污一亿元以上的不会有。”事实上，材料科正副科长都是“大老虎”。运动开展以后，他们消极抵抗，既不发动群众，也不坦白。而电业局的领导干部却认为：材料科在一九五○年曾因发生贪污案件而全面改组，正副科长都是共产党员，不会有大问题；因此，对他们采取姑息态度。直到中共北京市委根据材料决定撤销他们的职务时，电业局部分的领导干部还在犹豫，恐怕“冤枉好人”，还让他们自由行动，他们因此得以和私商串通口供。在这种情况下，一般小贪污分子坦白或被检举以后，有些人便满足于已取得的微小成绩。当运动的锋芒转向大贪污分子时，领导干部便失去了信心和决心。贪污分子王殿卿和孟庆祝，经过群众的检举和斗争以后，一度承认曾经勾结奸商，受贿贪污，但过几天后又推翻口供，说是被迫承认的。在大贪污分子顽强的抵抗下，领导干部动摇了，怕“斗错了下不了台”。甚至认为自己从查账中查出来的资料都不足为凭。因此，在春节前，打“虎”的队伍虽已组织起来，但领导干部却按兵不动，使运动暂时陷于停顿状态。
    这种情况，在春节后开始转变。总支委员会根据市委的指示，批判了右倾思想，并根据初步分析的情况，提出了保证打“虎”的数字。他们重整旗鼓，在供电、管理、营业部门组织四个“志愿打虎队”，由各部门的党委、团委领导。二月四日起，他们向贪污分子进行第一次围剿。在第一天晚上，营业部门就捕获了大贪污犯谭伟一；在五日、六日两天内，管理部门、供电部门又捕获了石桂泉、李忠、魏玉祥等大贪污犯。
    这次的胜利，彻底地肃清了领导干部的右倾思想，大大地增加了职工捕捉大贪污犯的勇气和信心。原来，领导干部对这些贪污分子的情况是估计不足的，把他们当作“小老虎”或“中等老虎”来斗争的。但实际上他们都是“大老虎”，有的已变为资本家。如被领导干部认为是“中等老虎”的谭伟一（南城营业站的抄表员），是国民党时代的一个官僚。在解放初期，他利用职权和奸商勾结，用报装过户倒表的办法，帮助私商偷电，从中贪污。他调任长辛店营业站主管后，则和某电料行勾结，介绍包工，使这家电料行攫取暴利。在群众检举、“打虎队”围剿下，仅仅两小时就承认曾在一家电料行入了股，曾倒过四十多个电表，少给用电户算杆线贴费，从中贪污一亿二千七百万元。又如被领导干部认为是“小老虎”的石桂泉和李忠，解放初期都在门头沟景门营业所当电工，利用职权给北营煤矿挂线甩表、偷电，按月到各煤窑拿赃款。一九四九年二、三月份，他们每人每月收到赃款一、二万斤小米。有些煤窑还有他们的股份。他们曾经使国家遭受一百万度电的损失。在群众猛烈的围剿下，他们很快地就承认：差不多门头沟所有的小煤窑都和他们勾结偷过电，有的还偷过器材；石桂泉共贪污了一亿五千多万元；李忠贪污了四亿二千多万元。
    领导干部和职工的眼睛都明亮了。他们初步估计：一九四九年到一九五○年，被偷的电达一千万度。如果其中有四分之一是被贪污了的话，就被贪污了二十亿元，里面大有文章可做。他们正在乘胜追击。
