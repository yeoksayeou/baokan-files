    Beijing Suburban Farmers Welcome the Performance of "Little Son-in-Law" Opposing Feudal Marriage
    Editor: Around the Spring Festival, many rural theater troupes in the suburbs of Beijing performed "Little Son-in-Law," which was very popular among the masses. Every performance filled the square. Some people even watched it several times and still wanted to see it. Some old ladies who didn't like watching new plays heard that this play was so good, they groped their way in the dark to see it. Everyone compared watching "Little Son-in-Law" to attending class and receiving education, using it to "open their minds." If someone didn't go, others would come to promote it. For example, someone said to me: "Your mother-in-law is so feudal, why doesn't she go and see it!" Plays like this that oppose the feudal arranged marriage system, like the previously performed "Xiao Erhei Gets Married," are of great educational significance to farmers and are urgently needed by everyone. We hope that writers will create more such good scripts.

### 北京郊区农民欢迎反对封建婚姻的“小女婿”的演出

    北京郊区农民欢迎反对封建婚姻的“小女婿”的演出
    编辑同志：春节前后，北京郊区有许多农村剧团演出了“小女婿”，很受群众欢迎。每次演出，广场上都是挤得满满的。有的人甚至看了几遍还想看。有些不爱看新戏的老太太听说这戏这好那好，也摸着黑路去看了。大家把看“小女婿”比作上课、受教育，是用来“开开脑筋”的。如果有谁不去，别人就要来进行宣传。像有人就对我说：“你家大妈那么封建，怎么不去看看哪！”像这样反对封建包办婚姻制度的戏，和以前演出的“小二黑结婚”一样，对农民教育意义是很大的，也是大家所迫切需要的。我们希望作家们多多创作这样好的剧本。
