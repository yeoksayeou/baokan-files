Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 19th (TASS): The US Senate Military Committee recently held four days of public hearings on the government's proposal to pass the so-called "Universal Military Training Plan." These hearings revealed that people from all important strata of American society universally oppose this militaristic plan, and this opposition is constantly growing.

Over the past few days, prominent figures and official spokespersons for Black people, youth, women, and important religious groups have sharply rebuked the government's attempt to force universal military training on Americans. They have completely exposed the official excuse that universal military training "will be beneficial to peace and national security."

Even the conservative Democratic Senator from Colorado, Johnson, in his speech called this plan a "fraud," wanting to
"hand people over to the Pentagon for arbitrary manipulation" and to "mortgage the lives of every eighteen-year-old youth indefinitely to the military."

Representatives from the "National Farmers Union," the conservative "National Farmers Organization," and the "American Farm Bureau" also opposed the universal military training plan.

The "National Farmers Organization" representative Sanders said: "Even if Congress forcibly passes the universal military training plan against the will of the majority, doing so will inevitably arouse the hatred of the people across the country. Therefore, this plan will sooner or later be abolished."

Reverend Van Kirk, the official representative of the "National Council of Churches of Christ in the United States of America," composed of twenty-nine denominations with thirty-two million followers, issued a statement opposing the passage of the universal military training plan. His statement was passed by the executive department of the "National Council of Churches of Christ in the United States of America" by a vote of thirty-nine to eight. Other religious groups' representatives who testified against implementing universal military training in the United States included: Shelley, chairman of the "United Christian Youth Movement," representing ten million Protestant youth, and Dawson, secretary of the "Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs." Dawson said that the "Southern Baptist Convention," representing seven million believers, believes that universal military training would destroy democratic rights and create "economic slavery." In addition, Libby, chairman of the non-interventionist "National Council for Prevention of War," said: "A small group of people in the Pentagon, in order to rearm, are promoting universal military training by strengthening people's fear of communism."

On February 14th, fifteen witnesses testified against universal military training, including Williamson, secretary of the "Labor Youth League," Krivitsky, chairman of the "New York Youth Peace Crusaders," and others. Both Williamson and Krivitsky said that instead of universal military training, a peace plan should be implemented, and a Five-Power Conference should be convened to ensure the resolution of outstanding differences. At this hearing, only a very few people defended universal military training.

After the hearings, the Senate Military Committee is preparing to propose some form of universal military training law. On February 7th, the House Military Committee had already passed a resolution by a vote of twenty-seven to seven to implement a universal military training plan this year. It is expected that the Senate Military Committee will follow suit. However, the Senate Military Committee's hearings have shown that the American people will unexpectedly and strongly oppose this plan.

### 美国农民团体和宗教团体等  反对实施普遍军训

    美国农民团体和宗教团体等
    反对实施普遍军训
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社纽约十七日讯：美国参议院军事委员会最近就政府要求通过所谓“普遍军训计划”的建议举行了四天公开意见听取会。这次意见听取会显示了美国各重要阶层的人民都普遍反对这个军国主义化的计划，而且反对的情绪还不断在增长。
    在过去几天中，各方知名人士和黑人、青年、妇女、宗教界各重要团体的正式发言人，都尖锐地斥责了政府要强迫美国人接受普遍军训的企图。而且完全揭穿了官方所称普遍军训“将有益于和平与国家安全”的藉口。
    甚至保守的科罗拉多州民主党参议员约翰逊在他的发言中也把这个计划称做是一个“骗局”，是想
    “把人们交给五角大楼任意摆布”，是要把“每个十八岁的青年的生命无限期地抵押在军事上面”。
    “全国农民联盟”、保守的“全国农民协进会”和“美国农业局”的代表们也反对普遍军训计划。
    “全国农民协进会”的代表山德斯说：“就算国会会违反大多数人的意志而强行通过普遍军训计划，但是这样做必将引起全国人民的痛恨。因此这个计划迟早是要被废弃的。”
    由拥有三千二百万信徒的二十九个教派组成的“美国基督教会全国委员会”的正式代表范寇克牧师发表声明，反对通过普遍军训计划。他的声明是经过“美国基督教会全国委员会”执行部以三十九票对八票通过的。在作证时反对在美国实施普遍军训的其它宗教团体的代表还有：代表一千万新教青年的“基督教青年联合运动”主席舍利佛，“浸礼会公共事务联合委员会”干事道逊。道逊说，代表七百万信徒的“南部浸礼会会议”认为普遍军训会摧毁民主权利并且造成“经济奴役”。此外，非战主义的“防止战争全国委员会”主席利比说：“五角大楼的一小撮人物为了要重整军备，正在以加强人们对共产主义的恐惧来推行普遍军训。”
    在二月十四日，有十五位证人作证反对普遍军训，其中有“劳动青年联盟”书记威廉逊、“纽约青年和平十字军”主席克利维斯基以及其他人士。威廉逊和克利维斯基都说，非但不应该普遍军训，而且还应该实施和平计划，应该召开五大国会议来保证解决悬而未决的歧见。在这个意见听取会上，只有极少的几个人替普遍军训辩护。
    在意见听取会结束后，参议院军事委员会准备提出某种形式的普遍军训法的建议。在二月七日，众议院军事委员会就曾以二十七票对七票通过了在今年实行普遍军训计划的决议，预料参议院军事委员会将步其后尘。但是参议院军事委员会的意见听取会使人看到了：美国人民将出乎意外地强烈地反对这个计划。
