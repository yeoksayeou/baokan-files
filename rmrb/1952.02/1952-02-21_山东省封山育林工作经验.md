Shandong Province has achieved remarkable success in forest closure for nurturing forests. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party committees and the People's Government at all levels, over the past two years, Shandong has closed off 1,786,000 mu of mountain slopes on major mountain ranges such as Laoshan, Yishan, Mengshan, and Taishan. Before last winter, a total of 437,000 mu were afforested. The closed-off slopes have gradually transformed into forested hills covered with lush trees. More than 11 million young trees, including red pine and black locust, were nurtured on the 180,000 mu of mountain slopes in Laoshan after being closed off for just over six months. Concurrently with forest closure for nurturing forests, various parts of Shandong have also extensively mobilized the people to promote soil and water conservation, thus greatly reducing soil erosion on the mountains. The upper reaches of rivers like the Yihe and Shuhe have been scoured deeper by one to two chi. This has reduced the threat of floods and droughts in various regions. Shandong Province also achieved great success in afforestation work last winter. According to preliminary statistics from more than 20 counties, including Yishui, Yiyuan, Laiwu, and Mengshan, over 300,000 farmers participated in afforestation last winter, cultivating 2,500 mu of seedlings and afforesting 250,000 mu.

Shandong's mountainous area accounts for about one-third of the province's total area. Due to war damage, not much of the vast forest remains. When the province was liberated in 1949, the forest area accounted for only 2.3 percent of the mountainous area. Most of Shandong's mountains are sandy and stony mountains composed of metamorphic rocks like gneiss and granite. After the forests are destroyed, the rocks weather quickly, making soil and water conservation very difficult. The riverbeds are silted up, and whenever mountain floods occur, the areas below the mountains are bound to suffer from flooding. In Yugou Village and other seventeen villages in Ju-Yi County, the source of the Shuhe River, more than 4,500 mu of farmland have been destroyed by floods over the past thirty years, causing great losses to people, livestock, and houses. The lives of farmers in mountainous areas have also become increasingly difficult. They rely solely on farming, reclaiming barren mountains, and digging up grass roots for a living, but the mountains are becoming increasingly impoverished. Therefore, farmers below the mountains urgently demand forest closure for nurturing forests. Farmers in mountainous areas also say, "Ten years of nurturing trees is better than farming."

After two years of effort, Shandong Province has gradually formed a mass movement of forest closure for nurturing forests in some areas and has gained a lot of experience.

Experience has proven that the Communist Party and the People's Government's leading organs must attach importance to forest closure for nurturing forests and must clearly recognize that leading agricultural production in mountainous areas means attaching importance to forestry. Over the past two years, Shandong has paid close attention to enriching and establishing forestry institutions and has established some forest farms. The forest farms first focused on forest closure for nurturing forests as a demonstration to educate cadres and the people. In April last year, Zhang Kexia, Minister of Agriculture and Forestry of the East China Military and Political Committee, went to the Yi-Lu mountainous area to conduct on-the-spot investigations of forestry work, thereby beginning to correct the generalized shortcomings of some cadres in mountainous areas in leading agricultural production and correcting their erroneous idea that "forestry work is only the business of the forestry department." This greatly promoted forest closure for nurturing forests and laid the foundation for mobilizing the masses to close off mountains and afforest.

To mobilize farmers to close off mountains for nurturing forests, the Shandong Provincial Communist Party organization and the People's Government have done a series of work, such as vigorously conducting patriotic ideological education among farmers, explaining the relationship between developing forestry production and resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea and national construction, and vigorously publicizing the People's Government's policy of protecting mountains and forests and promoting forest closure for nurturing forests through slogans, cartoons, and wall newspapers. Many special districts and counties have convened meetings of farmers' representatives from mountainous areas to discuss forest closure for nurturing forests. Some places have cultivated many farmer activists in forest closure and afforestation. Relying on these activists, Shandong has widely launched a mass movement of forest closure and afforestation. By last winter, 670 villages in mountainous areas across Shandong Province had organized forest protection committees, and these villages had a total of 4,974 forest protection groups. Each township has stipulated forest protection covenants, basically curbing the phenomenon of destroying mountains and forests. The People's Government has also helped these villages set up firebreaks in the mountains and forests to prevent huge losses caused by fires.

In the work of mobilizing the masses of farmers to close off mountains for nurturing forests, Shandong encountered many ideological concerns among farmers. If these ideological concerns are not effectively addressed and their practical difficulties are not helped to be resolved, the mass movement of forest closure for nurturing forests cannot be widely launched. There are two concerns in the minds of farmers: one is the issue of forest rights, "Will the forests we plant belong to us? Will they still belong to us in the future?" The other is the fear that there will be no place to cut firewood and graze cattle and sheep after the mountains are closed. In response to these ideological concerns, leading organs in various places have taken many necessary measures. At that time, various places publicized the nature of the current new democratic society in China, explained the future prospects of socialist society, and publicized the policy of "mountain rights remain unchanged, whoever closes the mountain cuts grass, whoever cuts grass plants trees, and whoever plants trees owns the forest rights." Various places also implemented mountain division and boundary demarcation on a village-by-village basis, organizing farmers to cooperate in afforestation on the barren mountains owned by the villages. Mountain division committees have also been established in each mountain, and mountain division and boundary demarcation have been widely carried out under the principle of mutual respect, mutual concession, and development of production. At present, key townships in more than a dozen counties have completed the work of mountain division and boundary demarcation, and the cooperative afforestation movement has gradually unfolded. Cooperative afforestation on barren mountains owned by the village, forest rights are owned by the village collectively. Cooperate in afforestation, cooperate in forest protection, and forest income is distributed according to shares. In addition, in order to take care of the development of animal husbandry, general villages have delineated pastures and herding roads, organizing shepherds to rotate grazing in a planned manner. Because forest closure restricts reclamation, in order to solve the temporary livelihood difficulties of farmers in mountainous areas, the People's Governments in various places have called on farmers to renovate the reclaimed mountain wastelands into terraced fields, increase fertilizer application, and increase the output per unit area. In addition, various places have also paid close attention to supporting the sideline production of farmers in mountainous areas. As for the problem of grass cutting after forest closure, various places stipulate that it should be cut twice a year in the seventh and tenth months of the lunar calendar. Since this method of opening mountains for grass cutting on a regular basis has been implemented, because the grass grows luxuriantly, the income of farmers from grass cutting has greatly increased compared to the past.

After this mass large-scale movement of forest closure and afforestation was launched, various parts of Shandong generally felt that there was a lack of tree species and seedlings. The method used in Shandong to solve this difficulty, in addition to being supplied by local forest farms and purchased from other provinces, is mainly to mobilize farmers to "take materials locally, use them themselves, cultivate them themselves, and plant them themselves." In this mass afforestation movement, the advanced experience of dryland seedling cultivation and direct seeding afforestation created by farmers is being adopted and promoted. This will greatly accelerate the forestry construction of Shandong Province.

At present, the People's Governments at all levels in Shandong are further organizing forest protection work and preparing for this year's spring afforestation work.

### 山东省封山育林工作经验

    山东省封山育林工作经验
    山东省的封山育林工作已经得到了显著的成绩。由于各级中国共产党委员会和人民政府的正确领导，两年来山东封禁了劳山、沂山、蒙山、泰山等主要山脉的山坡共一百七十八万六千多亩，去年冬季以前共造林四十三万七千多亩。封禁后的山坡，已渐渐变成绿树丛丛的林坡了。劳山十八万亩山坡封禁半年多，就保育了赤松、洋槐等幼树一千一百多万株。和封山育林同时，山东各地并普遍发动人民群众推行水土保持工作，因而山上泥沙流失大大减少，沂河、沭河等河流的上游河床都已被冲深了
    一、二尺。这就减轻了各地所受的水旱灾害的威胁。山东省去冬的造林工作又有很大的成绩。仅据沂水、沂源、莱芜、蒙山等二十多个县的初步统计：去冬全省参加造林的农民有三十多万人，育苗二千五百亩，造林二十五万亩。
    山东省山地面积约占全省总面积三分之一。大片山林由于战争的破坏，残存不多。一九四九年全省解放时，森林面积只占山地面积的百分之二点三。山东的山大部分是变质岩中的片麻岩和花岗岩构成的沙石山，林木遭破坏后，岩石风化得很快，水土保持很不容易。河道淤塞了，每当山洪暴发，山下必遭水灾。沭河发源地莒沂县于沟村等十七个村，三十多年来被冲毁了耕地四千五百多亩，人、畜、房屋也有很大损失。山区农民的生活也一天天困苦，他们单纯依靠农作，开山荒，刨草根为生，山却越来越穷了。因此，山下农民迫切要求封山育林。山区农民也说：“养树十年，胜过种田。”
    经过了两年的努力，山东省已在一部分地区逐渐地形成了群众性的封山育林运动，并且得到了很多经验。
    经验证明：共产党和人民政府的领导机关必须重视封山育林工作，必须明确认识：领导山区的农业生产就要重视林业。两年来，山东很注意充实和增设林业机构，建立了一些林场。先由林场有重点地封山育林，作为示范，用以教育干部和人民群众。去年四月，华东军政委员会农林部部长张克侠曾到沂鲁山区实地了解林业工作，从而开始纠正了山区某些干部领导农业生产的一般化的缺点，纠正了他们认为“林业工作只是林业部门的事情”的错误思想。这样就大大地推动了封山育林工作，打下了发动群众封山、造林的基础。
    发动农民封山育林，山东省共产党组织和人民政府做了一系列的工作，如：向农民大力进行爱国主义的思想教育，说明发展林业生产和抗美援朝、国家建设的关系，用标语、漫画、墙报大力宣传人民政府护山护林和提倡封山育林的政策等。许多专区和县召开过山区农民代表会议，讨论封山育林工作，有的地方培养了很多封山、造林的农民积极分子。山东各地便依靠这批积极分子，广泛展开了封山、造林的群众运动。到去年冬季，山东全省山区已组织起护林委员会的乡村有六百七十个，这些乡村共有四千九百七十四个护林小组。每乡都订有护林公约，基本上制止了破坏山林的现象。人民政府并帮助这些乡村在山林中设置了防火线，防止火灾造成巨大损失。
    山东在发动农民群众封山育林的工作中，遇到许多农民的思想顾虑，如果不切实解除他们的思想顾虑，帮助他们解决实际困难，封山育林的群众运动便不能广泛展开。农民思想上的顾虑有两个：一个是林权问题，“自己造的林是不是自己的？将来还是不是自己的？”另一个是怕封山后没有地方割柴草和放牛羊。针对这些思想顾虑，各地领导机关都采取了许多必要的措施。当时，各地宣传了目前中国新民主主义社会的性质，说明了将来的社会主义社会的远景，宣传了“山权不动，谁封山谁割草，谁割草谁造林，谁造林林权归谁”的政策。各地又以村为单位实行分山划界，组织农民在村有荒山上合作造林。各山还都成立了分山委员会，在互尊互让发展生产的原则下广泛进行了分山划界。现在已有十几个县的重点乡完成了分山划界工作，合作造林运动已逐渐展开。在村有荒山上合作造林，林权归村公有。合作造林，合作护林，林业收益按股分红。此外，为了照顾到畜牧事业的发展，一般村庄都划定了牧场牧道，组织牧倌有计划地轮流牧放。因为封山限制了开荒，为解决山区农民暂时的生活困难，各地人民政府号召农民把已开的山荒整修成梯田，增施肥料，提高单位面积的产量。另外，各地还很注意扶持山区农民的副业生产。至于封山后的割草问题，各地规定每年阴历七月、十月割两次。自从这种定期开山割草的办法实行后，因为草长得茂盛，农民割草的收益比过去大大地增加了。
    这个群众性的大规模的封山、造林运动开展后，山东各地普遍感到树种、树秧缺乏。山东解决这个困难的办法，除由各地林场供应和从外省采购以外，主要的是发动农民“就地取材，自采自用，自育自栽”。在这个群众造林运动中，农民创造的旱地育苗和直播造林的先进经验，正在被采用和推广。这将大大加速山东省的林业建设。
    现在山东各级人民政府正在进一步组织护林工作，并准备今年的春季造林工作。
