Representatives of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing hold a forum
Angrily protest the bacteriological atrocities committed by the invading American army in Korea

[By this newspaper] Representatives of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing held a current affairs forum on the 23rd, unanimously protesting the towering crimes of the American invading army in spreading bacteria in Korea and carrying out a bacteriological war of extermination.

Li Qiyuan, representative of a certain unit of the North China Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said: "After seeing the news that the invading American army has repeatedly spread plague, cholera and other bacteria on the Korean front and in the rear, we are extremely憤慨! at the towering crime of the US imperialism to carry out such a bacteriological war of extermination! The American bandits are dreaming of using this extremely despicable means to save their disastrous defeat on the Korean battlefield! In the past, the Japanese fascists did the same thing during the war of aggression against China, but we defeated them. Today, the American bandits can only get the same shameful end as the German and Japanese fascists!" Li Shaozhou, representative of a certain unit of the North China Military Region, said: "The news that the American bandits are conducting bacteriological warfare on the Korean battlefield has further increased our hatred for the American aggressors! The American bandits keep Japanese bacterial war criminals, use captured personnel of the Korean and Chinese People's Armies as experimental subjects, produce a large number of bacterial weapons, and openly use them on the Korean battlefield, which can only show that the American bandits are the public enemy of all mankind. We must seriously warn the American aggressors that their brutal crimes can only be severely punished!" Sun Jichen, representative of a certain unit of the People's Navy, said: "US imperialism's preparation and manufacture of various bacterial weapons that kill mankind is organized and planned. The bacterial warfare department of the US Army Chemical Corps' Fort Detrick Barracks has long invented sixteen kinds of bacterial weapons. As of March 1951, the American imperialist aggressors began to use captured personnel from the Chinese and Korean People's Armies to conduct bacterial weapons experiments. We fully believe that the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world will impose the most severe sanctions against the American aggressors' heinous crimes!" Ping Ling, representative of a certain unit of the People's Navy, protested, saying: "The American aggressors' crazy and brutal crimes are no different from those of the Hitler gang and the Japanese fascists. This proves that US imperialism is a disaster for mankind and the most brutal and ferocious enemy of the people all over the world!" Xie Demao, representative of a certain unit of the People's Air Force, protested, saying: "We still clearly remember that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Japanese invaders brutally spread bacteria by military aircraft in Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan and other places in our country, and today the American imperialists are raising Japanese bacterial war criminals to repeat this brutal and ferocious means of killing in front of us. The American imperialists' heinous crimes must be severely punished and given a heavier blow!" Liu Dawei, representative of a certain unit of the People's Air Force, said: "The American aggressors are doing everything possible to obstruct the Korean armistice negotiations, especially on the issue of prisoners of war, and have been denying the list of our captured personnel. They are doing this to massacre and abuse our captured personnel on a large scale and use our captured personnel for anatomical research and bacterial experiments. The American invading army used military aircraft to spread poisonous insects with bacteria in the front and rear of Korea to kill the Korean people and the Korean and Chinese People's forces. After hearing this news, our air force fighters were filled with righteous indignation. We must take concrete actions to oppose the atrocities of the American aggressors, step up our efforts to improve our combat skills to defend the motherland, and strike at the American aggressors!"

In the end, the representatives unanimously believed that this heinous crime of the American aggressors would be subject to due and severe punishment under the resolute and continued attacks of the Chinese and Korean People's Armies and the unanimous opposition of the people of the world.

    愤怒抗议侵朝美军撒布细菌暴行
    【本报讯】中国人民解放军驻京部队代表在二十三日举行时事座谈会，一致抗议美国侵略军在朝鲜撒布细菌，进行绝灭人性的细菌战争的滔天罪行。
    中国人民解放军华北军区某部代表李启元说：“我们看到侵朝美军在朝鲜前线、后方多次撒布鼠疫、霍乱等细菌的新闻后，对于美帝国主义进行这种绝灭人性的细菌战争的滔天罪行，感到万分愤慨！美国强盗是妄想用这种卑鄙到极点的手段来挽救它在朝鲜战场上的惨败，这只是做梦！过去日本法西斯在侵华战争中，就这样干过，但被我们打败了。今天，美国强盗也只能得到和德、日法西斯同样可耻的下场！”华北军区某部代表李少舟说：“美国强盗在朝鲜战场上进行细菌战争的消息，更增加了我们对美国侵略者的仇恨！美国强盗豢养日本细菌战犯，以朝中人民军队的被俘人员为试验品，大量制造细菌武器，并公然使用在朝鲜战场上，这只能说明美国强盗是全世界人类的公敌。我们要严重地警告美国侵略者，他们这种残暴的罪行，只能得到更严厉的惩罚！”人民海军某部代表孙寄尘说：“美帝国主义准备和制造残杀人类的各种细菌武器是有组织有计划的。美国陆军化学兵团之德第里克兵营的细菌作战部，早已发明了十六种细菌武器。至一九五一年三月，美帝国主义侵略者即开始了以中朝人民部队被俘人员进行细菌武器的试验。对于美国侵略者这种灭绝人性的滔天罪行，我们完全相信中朝人民和全世界人民必将给予最严厉的制裁！”人民海军某部代表平陵抗议说：“美国侵略者的疯狂、残暴罪行，是和希特勒匪帮和日本法西斯并无二致的。这证明了美帝国主义是人类的灾害，是全世界人民最残暴、最凶恶的敌人！”人民空军某部代表谢德懋抗议说：“我们还清楚地记得：在抗日战争时期，日寇曾在我国浙江、福建、湖南等地残暴地以军用飞机撒布过细菌，而今天美帝国主义竟又豢养日本细菌战犯，在我们面前重演这种残暴的、凶恶的杀人手段。美帝国主义这种万恶滔天的罪行，必须受到严厉的惩罚，必须给以更沉重的打击！”人民空军某部代表刘大为说：“美国侵略者百般阻挠朝鲜停战谈判，特别在俘虏问题上一直抵赖，不愿交出我方被俘人员的名单。它这么作是要大规模地残杀和虐待我方被俘人员，把我方被俘人员作解剖研究细菌实验。美国侵略军用军用飞机在朝鲜前线和后方撒布带有细菌的毒虫，来杀害朝鲜人民和朝、中人民部队。我们空军战士听了这些消息之后，都义愤填胸。我们一定要用具体行动来反对美国侵略者的暴行，加紧提高作战技术来保卫祖国，打击美国侵略者！”
    最后，代表们一致认为：美国侵略者这一滔天罪行，在中、朝人民军队坚决的继续打击下，在全世界人民的一致反对下，一定会受到应有的、严重的惩罚。
