    The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle is currently deepening in Beijing and Tianjin universities. Teachers have changed their original study plans and joined this movement to continue in-depth ideological remolding studies.

    On January 12th, the Beijing and Tianjin Universities Teachers' Study Committee decided that all schools would halt term exams and teachers would suspend their original study plans to join the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, engaging in in-depth ideological remolding studies. Consequently, the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle unfolded vigorously in Beijing and Tianjin universities. In this great movement, thanks to the leadership of each school boldly mobilizing the masses and promoting democracy, teachers, students, and staff members bravely and openly examined, reported, and exposed instances of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in the schools.

    Corruption in the schools is very serious, present in almost every department. As of January 25th, Beijing universities had already caught eighteen "tigers," both big and small. The movement also uncovered serious waste caused by stockpiled funds and equipment, damaged materials, extravagant spending, and reckless expenditure of funds. The Mechanical Engineering Department of the Beijing University of Technology alone had 2.6 billion yuan worth of national property stockpiled and damaged. There are many prominent examples of various damaged materials and extravagant waste. For example, the Yuan dynasty murals at the Beijing University Arts Institute were placed in the basement and ruined by water; Han bricks and Wei steles were placed in the courtyard, exposed to wind and sun, and used by dogs as nests; the lights in one warehouse were left on for a year; and the water pipes in the Chemistry Department were broken and leaked for seven years without repair. At Tsinghua University's Aviation Department, two intact B25 aircraft were left in disrepair due to poor maintenance, the direct-flow engines were missing, and the off-course sights were also lost. The engines had become bird nests, and the pilot's seat cushions had been taken home by someone. Due to poor preservation, the Biology Department of Beijing Normal University damaged several precious specimens, including the Australian platypus (of which there is only one in North China), worth more than 500 million yuan. These serious instances of waste fully exposed the bureaucratic attitudes of school administrations and their indifference to the property of the state and the people. The movement also exposed bourgeois ideologies such as departmentalism, sectarianism, self-interest at the expense of others, and the desire to reap without sowing. The phenomenon of departmentalism is universally and prominently manifested in the competition for funds and departmental development. The former School Affairs Committee of Beijing University often argued over funding issues, and some members even "threw their hats" (resigned in anger) over the issue of funding. Some members of the School Affairs Committee of Tsinghua University, in the matter of department adjustments, did not consider the needs of the state, but only the "development" of their own school. Many departments in various schools wanted to make their own school and their own department the "best" in the country, regardless of the development of other schools. Sectarianism is manifested in factionalism and small cliques. Divisions and infighting often occur between departments and between professors, undermining unity, harming work, and damaging the people's education cause. The ideas of self-interest at the expense of others and the desire to reap without sowing among teachers have also begun to be exposed. For example, Wang Hongzhen, Secretary-General of Beijing University and professor in the Department of Geology, and Huang Guozhang, Director of the Department of Geography at Beijing Normal University, stole the research results of others and published their works under their own names. They have both made self-criticisms to the masses. Some professors in the Department of Construction at Tsinghua University confessed: "We do not care about teaching, but go outside to engage in design work to make money." Some professors at the Tianjin Central Conservatory of Music are unwilling to put much effort into teaching and focus on creating and publishing to make money, producing shoddy work in their creations.

    The exposure of these serious instances of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has aroused great indignation among teachers, students, and staff members of various schools. From these facts, they truly saw the decadent side of the schools and the serious harm of bourgeois ideology. Everyone unanimously expressed that they could not tolerate these phenomena continuing to exist in the people's universities. All school administrative leaders have made self-criticisms in front of the masses. For example, Tang Yongtong, Vice President of Beijing University, confessed his mistakes of following old ways, acting perfunctorily, and being irresponsible. Lin Liru, President of Beijing Normal University, realized that he must rely on the masses and use the spirit of revolution to run the school well. Yang Shixian, Chairman of the School Affairs Committee of Nankai University in Tianjin, recognized the serious harm of bourgeois ideology to the work of the school and resolved to completely eliminate this ideology.

    In order to further promote the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle in Beijing and Tianjin universities, the Beijing and Tianjin Universities Teachers' Study Committee and the Beijing Universities Thrift Inspection Committee held a joint meeting on February 1st to arrange the work for the next stage. The meeting pointed out that the experience of the previous stage more powerfully demonstrated that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement itself is the most practical, most vivid, and most effective ideological remolding movement. Corruption, waste, and bureaucracy are concrete manifestations of bourgeois ideology. The problem of bourgeois ideology must be solved in actual struggle, and these dirty and filthy things must be completely swept out of the schools. Although some progress has been made in the previous stage, the movement is still far from thorough in all respects. The view that "the movement is almost over" is wrong. Therefore, the meeting decided that during the winter vacation, all schools in Beijing and Tianjin should continue to fully promote democracy, mobilize the masses, thoroughly carry out exposure and disclosure, seriously conduct criticism and self-criticism, and thoroughly carry out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. The administrative leaders of various schools who attended the meeting enthusiastically expressed their opinions and resolved to fight to the end. Tang Yongtong, Vice President of Beijing University, said: "I realized my shortcomings and the power of the masses in the movement. I discovered that the old Peking University was like a yamen (feudal government office), and bourgeois decadent ideology dominated Peking University. To eliminate these dirty things, we must continue the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement." Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University, said: "In the movement, we must not only overthrow the big tigers of corruption, but also the big tiger of bourgeois decadent ideology."

    京津高等学校深入展开反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争
    教师们在运动中继续进行思想改造的学习
    京津高等学校目前正进一步展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。教师们已改变原来的学习计划，转入这个运动，继续深入进行思想改造的学习。
    一月十二日，京津高等学校教师学习委员会决定，各校停止期考，教师们也停止原来的学习计划转入反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，深入思想改造的学习，京津各高等学校便轰轰烈烈地展开了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争。在这个伟大的运动中，由于各校领导方面放手发动群众、发扬民主，各校师生员工勇敢地公开地检查、检举、揭发了学校中的贪污、浪费、官僚主义的现象。
    各校贪污现象是很严重的，差不多每一部门都有。截至一月二十五日为止，北京市高等学校已打到大小老虎十八只。在运动中，也发现由积压资金器材、损坏物资、铺张浪费、乱花经费所造成的严重的浪费现象。北京大学工学院机械系仅积压和损耗国家资财一项即达二十六亿元。各种损坏物资、铺张浪费的突出例子是很多的。如北京大学文科研究所把元代的壁画放在地下室里被水浸坏；把汉砖、魏碑放在天井里，风吹日晒，让狗在上面做窝；一个仓库的电灯一年未熄；化学系自来水管坏了不修，漏了七年的水。清华大学航空系有两架完好的B25型飞机，由于没有很好的保管，残破不堪，直流发动机不见了，偏流瞄准器也丢了，发动机内成了鸟窝，驾驶员的座垫也被人拿回家去。北京师范大学生物系因保管不好，损坏澳洲鸭嘴兽
    （华北只有这一个）等珍品标本多件，价值五亿多元。这些严重的浪费事实，充分暴露了学校行政方面的官僚主义和对国家人民财产漠不关心的态度。在运动中也揭发了本位主义、宗派主义、损人利己、不劳而获等等的资产阶级思想。本位主义的现象，普遍地、突出地表现在争夺经费和院系发展等问题上。北京大学前校务委员会常为经费问题发生争吵，有的校务委员为争经费而“掼纱帽”。清华大学有的校务委员在院系调整问题上不从国家需要出发，只考虑自己学校的“发展”。许多学校的院系都想把自己的学校、自己的院系办成全国“第一”，不顾其他学校的发展。宗派主义表现在闹宗派、闹小集团上面。院和院之间、教授和教授之间往往发生分裂割据、勾心斗角的现象，破坏了团结，危害了工作，损害了人民教育事业。教员中损人利己、不劳而获的思想也开始被揭发。如北京大学秘书长兼地质学系教授王鸿祯、北京师范大学地理系主任黄国璋，窃取别人的研究成果，用自己的名义发表他人的著作，他们都向群众作了检讨。清华大学营建系有些教授检讨说：“不关心教学，到外边去搞设计工作赚钱。”天津中央音乐学院有的教授对教学工作不愿多研究，专心搞创作出版去赚钱，在创作时粗制滥造。
    这些严重的贪污、浪费、官僚主义现象被揭发以后，引起了各校师生员工的极大愤慨。他们从这些事实中真正看到了学校内部腐朽的一面，也看到了资产阶级思想的严重危害性。大家一致表示，决不能容忍这些现象继续存在于人民的大学中。所有的学校行政领导人都在群众面前进行了检讨。如北京大学汤用彤副校长检讨了自己的因循敷衍、不负责任的错误；北京师范大学林砺儒校长认识到要依靠群众，要用革命的精神来办好学校。天津南开大学校务委员会主席杨石先认识了资产阶级思想对学校工作的严重危害性，决心要把这种思想彻底清除。
    为了进一步在京津高等学校中开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，京津高等学校教师学习委员会和北京市高等学校节约检查委员会于二月一日召开联席会议，布置下一阶段的工作。会议指出，前阶段的经验更有力地说明：反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动本身就是最实际的、最生动的、最有效的思想改造运动。贪污、浪费、官僚主义就是资产阶级思想的具体表现，要在实际斗争中来解决资产阶级思想问题，要把这些肮脏污浊的东西从学校中彻底扫除干净。前一阶段虽然取得了一些成绩，但从各方面看运动还很不彻底。认为“运动已经差不多了”的看法是错误的。因此会议决定，京津各校在寒假期间继续充分地发扬民主，发动群众，彻底地进行揭发和暴露，严肃地展开批评和自我批评，把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动搞彻底。到会的各校行政负责人都热烈发表意见，决心斗争到底。北京大学汤用彤副校长说：“我在运动中认识了自己的缺点，认识了群众的力量。发现过去的北大像衙门，资产阶级腐朽思想统治着北大。要把这些脏东西清除掉，必须把反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动继续下去。”辅仁大学校长陈垣说：“我们在运动中不但要打倒贪污的大老虎，还要打资产阶级腐朽思想这只大老虎。”
