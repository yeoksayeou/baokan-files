	“February 7th” Veteran Worker Tang Zhongsan Actively Conducts Propaganda and Reports, Promoting the Anti-Corruption Struggle in Fengtai Materials Factory

	“February 7th” veteran worker and model propagandist Tang Zhongsan actively conducted propaganda and made reports during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Fengtai Materials Factory of the Tianjin Railway Administration. Through his efforts, workers reported 126 pieces of corruption material, capturing five major corrupt elements who embezzled 40 million to 1 billion yuan of state property.

	Tang Zhongsan is 58 years old this year and is a patrolman at the materials factory. During the "February 7th" Great Strike on the Jinghan Railway in 1923, he was a coal carrier in the Zhangde Locomotive Depot. Under the leadership of the Party, he joined the dare-to-die team of the "February 7th" Great Strike as a member. After the liberation of Fengtai in 1948, he and other workers actively protected the factory, arriving earliest for work every day. On August 30, 1950, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In February 1951, he was selected by the Party branch as a model propagandist of the Party.

	On January 2nd of this year, the factory entered the stage of studying anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy. The leading cadres’ taking the lead in self-criticism dispelled some of the masses' concerns, but major corrupt elements had not been caught. At this time, Tang Zhongsan patrolled all night and conducted propaganda during the day, addressing the remaining concerns of the masses. He first used the example of porter Li Guizeng to conduct a comparative propaganda of workers' lives before and after liberation. Li Guizeng was a temporary worker before liberation, receiving only twelve liang of corn flour per day. After liberation, he was promoted to a formal worker, receiving 300 jin of millet per month, and became the deputy leader of the grassroots trade union group. Tang Zhongsan connected Li Guizeng's changes in economic and political status after liberation with the glorious history of the "February 7th" struggle, which moved many workers. Li Guizeng and forger Li Zhenhai were the first to report He Ming, a planning and allocation officer who accepted bribes of 170 million yuan from 14 unscrupulous merchants, including Tianjin Hengyu Timber Firm, forcing He Ming to hand over embezzled gold (20 taels) and a watch. Tang Zhongsan then composed a "fighting tigers" allegro and propagated it everywhere. Wu Kun, the head of the storage section, confessed his crime of accepting bribes of 90 million yuan from 15 unscrupulous merchants, including Tianjin Hengda Hardware Firm, under the propaganda offensive of "catching tigers."

	After Wu Kun confessed, Tang Zhongsan, seeing the effectiveness of the propaganda offensive, cooperated with other Party propagandists with the help of the Party, deploying a joint offensive of cartoons, blackboard newspapers, wall newspapers, and allegro, and he himself more actively engaged in allegro propaganda. Soon, he found that Wei Xikun, a planning and allocation officer, became flustered and restless whenever he said allegro. He immediately composed an allegro targeting Wei's situation and sang: "You panic in the group meeting, you don't speak in ideological struggle, you can't sit still, you are restless, if you don't speak, you will be reported, and you will be punished then." When Wei Xikun heard Tang Zhongsan's allegro, he became even more flustered, his face changed, and he hurriedly made noises to calm himself. Seeing that the propaganda offensive was again effective, Tang Zhongsan reported Wei Xikun's suspicious situation to the leadership and at the same time inspired people close to Wei to report him. As a result, Yuan En'yu and Jin Xing, clerks who were dragged into the water by Wei Xikun, confessed their problems and then exposed Wei Xikun's crimes of stealing saccharin, mercury, pocket watches, medicines, clothes, etc., worth about 40 million yuan, and his sabotage of the movement by threatening them not to confess.

	After Wei was caught, all three workshops and twelve mixed study groups in the factory scrambled for “‘February 7th’ veteran worker Lao Tang to come and propagate.” So Tang Zhongsan composed an allegro play against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy based on the specific situation of the factory and performed it in various groups and at large meetings. After watching his allegro play, material worker Liu Chunsheng went back and confessed his minor corrupt acts and immediately reported Feng Shulin, an assistant material officer and a major corrupt element who embezzled 100 million yuan of state property. Porter Wu Shuling and others reported the crime of material officer Wang Xizeng stealing state assets. When the People's Liberation Army was about to enter Beijing, Wang Xizeng stole valuable materials worth 1 billion yuan from the Xibianmen Materials Factory and allowed other bad elements to steal materials, causing the state to lose more than 20 billion yuan.

	After the five "big tigers" were caught, the factory held an exhibition of赃物 (translator's note: goods/money acquired illegally), and Tang Zhongsan composed an allegro to propagate at the exhibition site. After seeing the exhibited赃物 and listening to Tang Zhongsan's allegro, the workers said, "Looking at this bit of gold on the table, I don't know how much gold our country will lose!" Hearing this reflection from the workers, Tang Zhongsan composed allegro such as "The Crimes of Unscrupulous Merchants" and "Corrupt Elements, Confess Quickly" to propagate, further promoting the "fighting tigers" movement in the factory. The workers expressed one after another: "We will never stop until we defeat the bourgeoisie's rampant attack on us and eliminate the corrupt elements." (Xinhua News Agency)

### “二七”老工人唐仲三积极进行宣传和检举  推动了丰台材料厂的反贪污斗争

    “二七”老工人唐仲三积极进行宣传和检举
    推动了丰台材料厂的反贪污斗争
    “二七”老工人、模范宣传员唐仲三在天津铁路管理局丰台材料厂的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，积极进行宣传和检举。在他的努力推动下，工人共检举了一百二十六件贪污材料，抓住贪污国家财产四千万元至十亿元的五个大贪污犯。
    唐仲三今年五十八岁，是材料厂的巡守员。一九二三年京汉路举行“二七”大罢工时，他是彰德机务段的抬煤工人，在党的领导下参加“二七”大罢工的敢死队做队员。一九四八年丰台解放后，他和其他工人一起积极保卫工厂，每天上班最早。一九五零年八月三十日，他光荣地参加了中国共产党。一九五一年二月，他被党支部评选为党的模范宣传员。
    今年一月二日该厂进入反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义学习，首长的带头检讨解除了群众某些顾虑，但大贪污分子没有捉到。唐仲三这时就晚间整夜巡守，白天针对群众还存在的某些顾虑进行宣传。他首先用搬运工人李贵增的例子对大家进行了解放前后工人生活的对比宣传。李贵增解放前是临时工，每日只能领到十二两棒子面，解放后升为正式工，一月拿三百斤小米，而且当了工会基层小组副组长。唐仲三把李贵增解放后的经济、政治地位的变化和“二七”的光荣斗争历史联系起来宣传，感动了许多工人。李贵增和锻工李振海首先检举了接受天津恒裕木行等十四家奸商贿赂一亿七千万元的大贪污犯计配员何铭，迫使何铭交出赃款黄金二十两、手表一只。于是唐仲三又编了个“打老虎”的快板到处宣传。保管股股长吴崐就在“捉老虎”的宣传攻势下自动坦白了接受天津恒达五金行等十五家奸商贿赂九千万元的罪行。
    在吴崑坦白后，唐仲三见宣传攻势收了效，就在党的帮助下和其他党的宣传员配合起来，布置了漫画、黑板报、墙报、快板的联合攻势，自己也更积极地进行快板宣传。不久，他发现计配员魏熙昆一遇到他说快板就形色惊慌、坐立不安，他就针对魏的情形马上编一个快板唱道：“小组会，你发慌，你在思想斗争不发言，坐不定，立不安，你不说，被检举，到那时候就法办。”魏熙昆一听唐仲三的快板就更加发慌，脸色也变了，赶忙找人打打闹闹来镇定自己。唐仲三看见宣传攻势又收了效，就向领导方面反映了魏熙昆的可疑情形，同时又启发和魏接近的人起来检举。结果被魏熙昆拖下水去的事务员袁恩煜、金惺坦白了自己的问题，并接着揭发了魏熙昆偷盗糖精、水银、怀表、药品、衣服等约值四千万元的罪行，和魏威胁他们不许坦白的破坏运动的情形。
    魏犯落网后，全厂三个车间十二个混合学习小组都争着要“‘二七’老工人老唐来宣传宣传”。于是唐仲三又根据本厂具体情形编了个反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的快板剧，在各个小组和大会上演出。材料工人刘春生看了他的快板剧后，回去坦白了自己的小贪污行为，并立刻检举了贪污国家财产一亿元的大贪污犯助理材料员冯树林。搬运工人吴寿龄等检举了材料员王希曾偷盗国家资财的罪行。王希曾在人民解放军将进入北京城时偷盗了西便门材料厂价值十亿元的贵重物资，并听任其他坏分子偷盗物资，使国家损失二百亿元以上。
    五个“大老虎”捉到后，该厂举行赃物展览，唐仲三又编了快板在展览地点宣传。工人们看了展览的赃物，又听了唐仲三的快板，说：“看看桌子上这点金子，不知道我们国家要损失多少黄金呀！”唐仲三听见工人们的这种反映，便又编了“奸商的罪恶”“贪污分子快坦白”的快板进行宣传，进一步推动该厂的“打老虎”运动。工人们纷纷表示：“不把资产阶级向我们的猖狂进攻打垮，不把贪污分子清除干净，我们决不罢休。”  （新华社）
