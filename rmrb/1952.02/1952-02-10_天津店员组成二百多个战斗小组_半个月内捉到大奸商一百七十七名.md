    Tianjin store employees, standing on the front lines of the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence, have formed 276 strong combat groups since late January, launching a powerful offensive, penetrating "tiger dens," and pursuing "tiger" profiteers. In half a month, they have captured 177 major profiteers involved in bribery, tax evasion, and theft of state assets amounting to ten to two hundred billion yuan. Among them, 92 major profiteers refused to confess after repeated education by store employees and have been arrested by the People's Court. This is a great victory for the vast number of store employees in Tianjin against the bourgeois counter-attack, and also a serious blow and profound lesson to the profiteers who refuse to confess.
    Under the unified leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Store Employees' Union and the savings inspection sub-committees of various districts, Tianjin store employees have established three command headquarters throughout the city and formed combat groups according to industry and region. The chairman and department heads of the Tianjin Municipal Store Employees' Union have personally gone to the front lines to direct operations and lead the three command headquarters in combat. Based on the foundation of class consciousness and patriotic ideological education, Tianjin store employees have demonstrated a high degree of combat effectiveness; every store employee, with the determination to eliminate evil completely, has cooperated with the people of the city to encircle and attack from both inside and outside.
    The slogan "Dive deep into the mountains to catch tigers, and never withdraw until victory" has become the actual action of the vast number of store employees. For example, the Sheng Lianzhong combat group of 14 people, starting from January 26th, caught four big tigers in just ten days by February 6th. They fought until three or four in the morning without rest. The two combat groups led by model store employees Han Jiasheng and Huang Yingling fought continuously for two days and two nights during a joint attack on a certain trading firm, and no one showed fatigue.
    In every battle, profiteers always used words like "bond," "I don't remember, you go check the accounts," and "I have back accounts, but I burned them," to perfunctorily respond, or cried and feigned madness and stupidity, going back on their word and being fickle, etc., attempting to escape. These cunning tricks and ugly behaviors of the profiteers have all gone bankrupt under the fierce attack of the combat groups.
    Tianjin's vast number of store employees were able to achieve such great victories in a short period of struggle due to the following preliminary experiences: (1) Preparatory investigation and research work must be done well, the enemy and our situation must be correctly analyzed, clues must be sought in many ways, and reliable materials must be grasped. This is a fighting method that is both "stable" and "accurate," and effective with a single attack. (2) Rely on the activists in your own unit and strive to unite senior store employees. This is the main key to catching tigers. To win over senior store employees, it is necessary to strengthen class education and patriotic ideological education so that they recognize that returning to their own ranks is promising and glorious. It is necessary to understand that the ideological emotions of senior store employees are more complex, and there are many concerns, such as some of them having bribed, written back accounts, evaded taxes, and kept back accounts for capitalists under the threat and inducement of capitalists, and they dare not speak out under the threat of profiteers, fearing that they will be attacked by the capitalists if they speak out, and fearing that they will commit personal crimes. In addition, some senior store employees have accepted some bribes from capitalists and have deep ideological concerns, fearing that they will be criticized by workers if they speak out, fearing that they will be expelled from membership, and fearing that they will not be able to find a job after losing their jobs and that their families will have no way to live. There are also some senior store employees whose thinking is very confused. The capitalist steals state assets and distributes a little to them. They do not see it as the capitalist pulling them into the water, but think that the capitalist is good to them. As long as we give powerful criticism and explanation to the above-mentioned ideological concerns and confused thinking, they can quickly wake up. (3) The combat group should be equipped with sufficient manpower, which is the main force to break through the enemy's fortress. In the combat group, it is necessary to equip various personnel such as accountants, business personnel, purchasing personnel, and bookkeepers. In units that have dealings with trading firms and foreign companies, it is also necessary to have people who can check English telegrams. In addition, it is necessary to equip one or two people who can both reason and argue and are brave and resourceful, good at exposing the cunning behavior of the enemy, so that they can take the initiative in the battle. (4) Tianjin's experience proves that after mobilizing the masses through confession and denunciation meetings, conducting in-depth inspection work in a planned and focused manner in the form of combat groups is an indispensable step to lead the movement to a new climax and catch tigers.

### 天津店员组成二百多个战斗小组  半个月内捉到大奸商一百七十七名

    天津店员组成二百多个战斗小组
    半个月内捉到大奸商一百七十七名
    【本报讯】站在反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家财产、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报运动最前线的天津店员，从一月下旬以来，组成了二百七十六个坚强的战斗小组，发动了强大的攻势，深入“虎穴”，追捕“老虎”奸商。半月来已捉住行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财在十亿到二百亿元的大奸商一百七十七名。其中九十二名大奸商经店员多次教育竟拒不坦白，已为人民法院逮捕。这是天津广大店员对资产阶级反攻的大胜利，也是给予拒不坦白的奸商一个严重的打击和深刻的教训。
    天津店员在中国店员工会天津市委员会及各区节约检查分会统一领导下，在全市建立了三个指挥部，并按照行业、地区组成战斗小组；天津市店员工会的主席和各部部长都亲上前线指挥，领导三个指挥部作战。天津店员在阶级觉悟和爱国主义思想教育的基础上，发挥了高度的战斗威力；每个店员，都以除恶务尽的决心，配合全市人民层层包围，内外夹攻。
    “跳入深山捉老虎，不到胜利不收兵”的口号，已成为广大店员的实际行动。例如绳连仲战斗小组十四个人，从一月二十六日开始战斗，至二月六日为止，仅十天的工夫，就捉到四个大老虎。他们战斗到深夜三四点钟还不休息。模范店员韩家声、黄英龄领导的两个战斗小组，在联合攻击某贸易行时，一气战斗了两天两夜，没有一个人表示疲劳。
    每个战斗中，奸商总是以“具结”“我记不清，你们去查帐罢”，“后帐我有，就是烧了”等话来搪塞，或哭哭啼啼装疯卖傻，说了不算，反复无常等等狡猾行为，企图逃避。这些奸商惯用的伎俩和丑恶的行为，在战斗小组的猛烈攻击下，全部破产。
    天津广大店员在短时间的斗争中能获得这样巨大的胜利，有这样几个初步经验：（一）事先要作好调查研究工作，正确分析敌我情况，多方面寻找线索，掌握可靠材料。这是既“稳”又“准”、一攻即下的斗争方法。（二）依靠本单位的积极分子，争取团结高级店员。这是捉拿老虎的主要关键。争取团结高级店员，要加强阶级教育和爱国主义的思想教育，使他认识回到自己队伍中来，是有前途的、光荣的。要懂得高级店员的思想情绪是较为复杂，而且顾虑又多，例如他们有的在资本家的威胁利诱之下，行过贿，写过后帐，偷过税，替资方保存后帐，在奸商的威胁下也不敢说，怕说了受资方打击，怕个人犯罪。另外一些高级店员接受过资本家一些贿赂，思想顾虑很深，怕说了受到工人批评，怕开除会籍，又怕失业后找不到职业，家庭生活没有办法。还有一部分思想非常糊涂的高级店员，资本家盗窃国家资财分给了他一点，他不是看成资本家拉他下水，而认为是资方对他不错。只要我们针对以上思想顾虑和糊涂思想给予有力的批评和解释，他们就能很快地觉悟过来。（三）战斗小组要配备足够的人马，是攻破敌人堡垒的主要力量。在战斗小组中，要配备例如会计、业务员、采购员、司帐等各种人员。在贸易行和外商交往的单位，还需要会查英文电报的，另外要配备一两个既能说理辩诘又要勇敢机智，善于揭破敌人的狡猾行为，这样在战斗中便能争取主动。（四）天津的经验证明：通过坦白检举大会把群众发动起来以后，以战斗小组的形式，有计划、有重点地深入检查工作，是把运动引向新的高潮捉拿老虎的不可缺少的步骤。  （据光明日报消息）
