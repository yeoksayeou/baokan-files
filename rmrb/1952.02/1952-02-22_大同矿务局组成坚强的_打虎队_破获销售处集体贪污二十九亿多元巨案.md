Datong Mining Bureau Forms a Strong "Tiger-Fighting Team"
Uncovers a Huge Embezzlement Case of 2.9 Billion Yuan in the Sales Department

    The Sales Department of the Datong Mining Bureau recently uncovered a collective embezzlement case involving more than 2.9 billion yuan. This large-scale collective embezzlement case was solved under the personal command of Xu Zhiyuan, Secretary of the Datong Coal Mine Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, relying on all the miners, leading a strong "tiger-fighting team," and through layers of encirclement, internal and external attacks, and relentless pursuit. All the embezzlers were caught between February 3rd and 6th.

    The Sales Department of the Datong Mining Bureau had long been completely corrupted and had become a stronghold for the bourgeoisie to steal state property within our state-owned enterprises. One of the masterminds of this collective embezzlement case, the major embezzler Wang Baoying, was originally a low-ranking officer under the Yan Xishan bandit regime. After liberation, he infiltrated the Datong Mining Bureau and served as a statistician and business section chief in the Sales Department. In March 1950, Wang Baoying conspired with Wu Bingxuan, the deputy section chief of the Accounting Section of the Sales Department (a major embezzler with the alias Wu Zheng, a Kuomintang branch committee member, and of merchant background), and others to consciously use "sugar-coated bullets" to drag Liu Wending, the deputy director of the Sales Department (a Communist Party traitor who infiltrated the Party again in 1948), and others into the quagmire of embezzlement. At that time, Wang Baoying and the major embezzlers Li Runqing and Wu Bingxuan jointly stole 1,000 tons of coal, worth 125 million yuan. Wang Baoying reported to Liu Wending that "someone is stealing coal" to probe Liu Wending's attitude, while secretly sending Liu Wending a large amount of stolen money. This Liu Wending, whose will was very weak, accepted bribes totaling 40 million yuan in three instances. Therefore, although Liu Wending knew that someone was stealing and selling large quantities of coal, he no longer cared about it because he had accepted bribes. Wang Baoying seized on Liu's weakness of being greedy for money and accurately grasped his habit of liking to drink alcohol. Wang and the other "moles" sent in by this group of bourgeoisie often invited him to drink and, while drinking, freely discussed how difficult the past was and how they should "improve their lives" today. After they used these despicable and shameless methods to lure Liu Wending, they signed an embezzlement "contract" in the tavern. From then on, large-scale, collective embezzlement began. Liu Wending, who was hit by the "sugar-coated bullet," once again betrayed the Party and became an enemy of the people, one of the masterminds of the large collective embezzlement case, and became the bourgeoisie's agent in the national economic organs. Wang Kexian, the secretary of the CCP branch, was transferred to work in the Sales Department in August 1950, and was soon surrounded by this group of major embezzlers and also hit by "sugar-coated bullets." Wang Baoying and others sent Wang Kexian a share of the stolen goods each time they collectively embezzled. At this time, the Sales Department had become an extremely corrupt embezzlement group, and most of the cadres had become embezzlers "sent in" or "pulled over" by the bourgeoisie. Colluding with unscrupulous merchants, they embezzled a large number of state freight cars over the past two years, stole a large amount of state coal, and smuggled coal to Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and other places. According to preliminary calculations, this large embezzlement group stole more than 21,000 tons of lump coal and mixed coal, and also colluded with unscrupulous merchants to embezzle 375 train cars. The total amount of embezzlement is 2.9 billion yuan. As for the serious losses suffered by the national economy as a result, it is difficult to calculate.

    大同矿务局组成坚强的“打虎队”
    破获销售处集体贪污二十九亿多元巨案
    大同矿务局所属销售处最近破获了一个数达二十九亿多元的集体贪污案。这个集体的大贪污案，是在中共大同煤矿委员会书记徐志远亲自指挥下，依靠全体矿工，带领坚强的“打虎队”，层层包围，内外夹攻，跟踪追击而破获的。贪污犯们在二月三日到六日全部落网。
    大同矿务局销售处，在很早以前，就已经完全变质，成了资产阶级在我们国营企业里面的盗窃国家财产的据点。这个集体贪污案的主谋人之一、大贪污犯王葆瑛，原是阎匪锡山手下的下级军官，解放后混进大同矿务局任销售处统计员、业务股股长等职。一九五零年三月间，王葆瑛和销售处会计科副科长、大贪污犯吴秉轩（假名吴政，国民党区分部委员，奸商出身）等人计议，有意识地用“糖衣炮弹”把销售处副处长刘文定（共产党的叛徒，一九四八年又混入党内）等人拉进贪污的泥坑。当时王葆瑛曾和大贪污犯李润清、吴秉轩合伙盗窃了一千吨煤，价值一亿二千五百万元。王葆瑛一面向刘文定报告说“有人偷煤”，来刺探刘文定的口气，同时暗地里送给刘文定大批赃款。这个意志十分薄弱的刘文定，三次共收了贿赂四千万元。所以，虽然刘文定知道有人大量偷卖煤炭，但因为吃了贿赂，就再也不管这回事了。王葆瑛抓住刘犯见钱眼红的弱点，又摸准刘犯爱喝酒的习气，王犯等这群资产阶级派进来的“坐探”，就常常请他喝酒，并在喝酒时，畅谈过去如何艰苦，今天应当“改善生活”等等。他们用这种卑鄙无耻的手段来诱惑刘文定之后，就在酒馆里订下了贪污的“合同”。从此就开始了大规模的、集体的贪污。被“糖衣炮弹”打中的刘犯文定，从此再度叛变了党，变成人民的公敌、大集体贪污案中的主谋人之一，成为资产阶级“拉过去”的在国家经济机关中的代理人。中共支部书记王克现，一九五零年八月调到销售处工作，不久就被这群大贪污犯包围起来，也被“糖衣炮弹”打中了。每次集体贪污到的赃物，王葆英等都给王克现送一份。这时销售处已成了极端腐烂的贪污集团，大部分干部成了资产阶级“派进来”或“拉过去”的贪污犯。他们和奸商勾结，两年来盗用了国家大量的车皮，盗窃了国家大量的煤，向上海、天津、北京等地走私运煤。仅根据初步计算，这个大贪污集团共盗窃了二万一千多吨块煤和混合煤，还勾结奸商盗用了三百七十五辆火车皮。总计贪污数字是二十九亿元。至于使国家经济因此遭受的严重损失，就难以计算了。
