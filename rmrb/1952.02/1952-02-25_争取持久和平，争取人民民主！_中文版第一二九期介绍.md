    The Chinese edition of issue 129 of the Cominform organ "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" was published on the 23rd. This issue features an editorial entitled "Political Agitation is a Powerful Weapon of Communist and Workers' Parties." Important articles in this issue include: "The 28th Anniversary of Lenin's Death," a report by Pospelov, Director of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute of the Soviet Union, at the Moscow Commemoration Meeting; "The Polish Working Class Struggles to Increase Labor Productivity" by Klosiewicz, Central Committee Member of the Polish United Workers' Party and Chairman of the Central Council of Polish Trade Unions; and "The Tito-Plastiras Conspiracy is a Threat to Balkan Peace" by Kastrinjos.

    The editorial in this issue states: Political agitation is a powerful method for strengthening the ties between the Party and the masses, educating the masses, and winning them over to the struggle for peace and freedom. The experience of the international workers' movement teaches us that without constant, militant political agitation, it is impossible to unite the masses and lead them in the struggle against reaction and for the vital interests of the people, and it is impossible to ensure the Party's consistent and concrete leadership over the masses. The editorial points out: Lenin and Stalin always paid attention to political agitation. The advantages of the political agitation of the Soviet Bolshevik Party lie in its high ideological level, authenticity, clarity, purposefulness, concreteness, and its clear, active, and militant nature. Now, the Communist and Workers' Parties in people's democratic countries and capitalist countries are learning from the example of the Soviet Communist Party. The speed of socialist construction in the people's democratic countries is rapidly increasing (and the class struggle is also becoming increasingly acute), and the demands of the broad working people in cultural and political aspects are increasing day by day, so the requirements for agitation work are also higher. Therefore, the Party's mass agitation work must be targeted at the current main task, which is the struggle for the smooth construction of socialism. It is necessary to comprehensively improve mass work in urban and rural areas, improve the ideological level of agitation work, regularly inform the masses about the most important events at home and abroad, prominently publish the achievements of socialist construction in newspapers, enrich the forms and methods of political agitation, and strengthen the initiative of the working people. In capitalist countries, colonies, and dependent countries, the purpose of the Party's mass propaganda work is to expose the conspiracies of warmongers, mobilize the masses to struggle for peace, freedom, and the democratic rights of the people, and against the enslavement of US-British imperialism. The editorial emphasizes that the effectiveness of agitation depends largely on the ability to skillfully and differentially treat the needs and demands of people from all walks of life, and on the ability to have political sharpness.

    In his article, Klosiewicz points out that increasing labor productivity is the most important thing for all people's democratic countries. The workers in these countries are becoming increasingly clear that increasing production and improving quality can make the motherland rich and strong and benefit the cause of peace. Therefore, more and more workers are throwing themselves into socialist production competitions, struggling to use and absorb new technologies, and becoming rationalization proposers and inventors. Klosiewicz then describes the development of the production competition since the liberation of Poland and its significant role in over-fulfilling the three-year economic plan. He said: Now, the production competition is developing to a higher level, and collective competitions between various industrial sectors are being widely carried out. Moreover, with the development of the movement, the number of rationalization proposers and inventors is increasing, and scientific workers are closer to enterprise life. Therefore, the task of the Polish trade unions is to help workers who put forward rationalization proposals establish closer ties with scientific workers, engineers, and technicians, establish rationalization groups that can solve the most complex problems of production rationalization, and intensify the fight against bureaucracy in dealing with rationalization proposals and inventions.

    In his article, Kastrinjos exposes the conspiracy of the reactionary rulers of Yugoslavia and Greece, saying: Since the Tito gang and the Athenian royalist fascists clamorously announced the restoration of diplomatic relations more than a year ago under the orders of the United States, telephone, telegraph, postal, railway, and aviation links between the two countries have been successively restored, and the two countries have exchanged military attachés and military delegations. The port of Salonica in Greece has begun to become lively, with US war materials being supplied to the Tito gang through it, and Yugoslav raw materials being shipped to the United States through it. The Tito bandits have begun to hand over the children of Greek democrats who have taken refuge in Yugoslavia to the Greek royal government and have stepped up the dispatch of spies to Greece to undermine the Greek democratic movement. Tito and Plastiras (the Prime Minister of the Greek reactionary government) intend to conclude a military agreement immediately. The fascists of the two countries are fanatically preparing for war. Kastrinjos goes on to say: The closer the alliance between Tito and Plastiras, the greater the danger to the Balkans. However, the people of Greece and Yugoslavia want peace and are fighting for peace. Their eyes are on the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the invincible Soviet Union.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二九期介绍
    共产党情报局机关刊“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二九期已在二十三日出版。这
    一期发表了题为“政治鼓动是共产党和工人党的强有力的武器”的社论。这一期的重要文章包括：苏联马恩列学院院长波斯伯洛夫在莫斯科纪念大会上作的“列宁逝世二十八周年”的报告；波兰统一工人党中央委员、波兰工会中央理事会主席柯罗西维兹的“波兰工人阶级为提高劳动生产率而斗争”；卡斯特里诺斯的“铁托—普拉斯蒂拉斯的阴谋是巴尔干和平的威胁”等。
    这一期的社论说：政治鼓动是加强党和群众的联系、教育群众并争取他们为和平和自由而斗争的有力的方法。国际工人运动的经验教导我们：没有经常的、战斗的政治鼓动，就不可能团结群众并把他们引导到反对反动、争取人民的切身利益的斗争中，就不可能保证党对群众的一贯的具体的领导。社论指出：列宁和斯大林经常注意政治鼓动。苏联布尔什维克党政治鼓动的优点，在于它的高度的思想水平、真实性、明确性、目的性、具体性，和它的明白、积极而战斗的性质。现在，人民民主国家和资本主义国家的共产党和工人党，都学习苏联共产党的榜样。人民民主国家的社会主义建设的速度正在迅速增加（阶级斗争也随着日益尖锐），广大劳动人民在文化和政治方面的要求正在日益提高，因而对于鼓动工作的要求也就更加提高了。因此，党的群众鼓动工作必须针对目前的主要任务，就是争取顺利地建设社会主义的斗争。必须全面地改进城市和乡村的群众工作，提高鼓动工作的思想水平，经常使群众了解国内外最重要的事情，在报纸上显著刊载社会主义建设的成就，丰富政治鼓动工作的形式和方法以及加强劳动人民的积极性。在资本主义国家、殖民地和附属国，党的群众宣传工作，目的在于揭露战争贩子的阴谋，动员群众起来斗争，争取和平、自由和人民的民主权利，反对美英帝国主义的奴役。社论强调说：鼓动能否发生效力，大部分决定于能否干练地、有分别地对待各阶层人民的需要和要求，决定于能否具有政治的尖锐性。
    柯罗西维兹在文章中指出：提高劳动生产率是所有人民民主国家最重要的一件事。这些国家的工人们一天天清楚地了解到增加生产和提高质量，可以使祖国富强，并有益于和平事业。因此，愈来愈多的工人投身到社会主义生产竞赛中，为使用和吸收新技术而斗争，并成为合理化建议者和发明者。柯罗西维兹接着叙述了波兰解放以来生产竞赛的发展情况及其对于超额完成三年经济计划所起的重大作用。他说：现在，生产竞赛正在向更高级的形式发展，各个工业部门之间的集体竞赛正在广泛进行着。而且，随着运动的发展，合理化建议者和发明者的人数正越来越多，科学工作者更加接近企业生活。因此，波兰工会的任务就是帮助提出合理化建议的工人，和科学工作者、工程师及技术人员建立更密切的联系，建立能够解决生产合理化的最复杂问题的合理化小组，加紧反对对待合理化建议和发明的官僚主义。
    卡斯特里诺斯在文章中揭发南斯拉夫和希腊反动统治者合作的阴谋说：自从铁托匪帮和雅典保皇法西斯分子，在美国的命令下大吹大擂地宣布恢复外交关系的一年多以来，两国间的电话、电报、邮政、铁路和航空联络都陆续恢复，两国并互派了军事参赞和军事代表团。希腊的萨罗尼加港开始热闹起来了，美国战争物资就经由那里供给铁托匪帮，南斯拉夫的原料则经由那里运到美国去。铁托匪徒已开始把避难于南斯拉夫的希腊民主人士的孩子移交给希腊保皇政府，并加紧派遣间谍到希腊去破坏希腊的民主运动。铁托和普拉斯蒂拉斯（希腊反动政府首相）已打算马上缔结军事协定。两国的法西斯分子正在狂热地准备战争。卡斯特里诺斯接着说：铁托和普拉斯蒂拉斯的联盟愈是密切，巴尔干的危险就愈大。但是，希腊和南斯拉夫人民要和平，并且正在为和平而斗争。他们的眼睛望着以不可战胜的苏联为首的和平、民主和社会主义阵营。
