    How I Uphold Party Principles and Fight Against Song Ying, Wang Qing, and Others
    Sun Mailing, Head of the Medical Affairs Section, Wuhan Second Municipal Hospital

    The embezzlement case at Wuhan Second Municipal Hospital finally came to light after a tortuous process of ten months. The Central China Bureau of the CCP made a correct decision on the case and gave Zhou Jifang, Song Ying, Wang Qing the punishment of expulsion from the Party, which is completely correct and necessary, and I fully support it. After the embezzlement case occurred in our hospital, while Ji Kaifu was detained, I was also constantly hated by Song Ying, Wang Qing, and others, and I was subjected to their slander and attacks. They even tried to frame me. Today, experiencing it firsthand, I deeply feel the Party's strict discipline, clear distinction between right and wrong, and selfless dedication when I see the Party organization's correct handling of this case.

    On the afternoon of April 12th last year, an embezzlement case occurred at Wuhan Second Municipal Hospital. At that time, the hospital was undergoing rectification and had already begun studying the suppression of counter-revolutionaries. In the past, many incidents had occurred at our hospital, and this case was particularly prominent, so all comrades in the hospital were particularly concerned about it and determined to get to the bottom of it. Because the incident was very serious, besides Wang Qing, I was a more responsible Party cadre in the hospital, but because I did not understand the case well, I decided to clarify the case first.

    Ji Kaifu's sudden arrest confused me for a while. According to the case, it was unlikely that Ji Kaifu was the embezzler. Then, a rumor of a "political frame-up" spread in the Second Hospital. How to resolve this doubt? I thought that as long as we rely on the Party and the organization, there is no problem that cannot be solved. So I went to Secretary-General Li Zhilian of the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Central China Bureau and Comrade Su Wei, Secretary of the Fourth District Committee of the CCP in Wuhan, and they gave me a lot of help, instructing me to abandon all "preconceived notions" and handle this issue objectively and realistically. Throughout the struggle, they gave me a lot of help and encouragement in principle and in thought, which increased my determination and courage to fight. I first determined that no matter what the nature of the embezzlement case was, as long as the embezzler was caught first, other problems would be solved; therefore, on the one hand, I continued to investigate the case, and on the other hand, I sorted out some existing materials, repeatedly verifying each material, and even conducting on-site experiments to ensure that each piece was true. I also investigated Ji Kaifu's history.

    With some materials, I needed to find the key clues and study where the person who stole the money might be. According to the testimonies and physical evidence from all parties and the situation at the scene at the time, I believed that Wang Qing was the most suspected. I truthfully reported these situations and the course of the case at a meeting convened by the Fourth District Committee. After the Public Security Fourth Sub-bureau released Ji Kaifu for the first time, Song Ying and Wang Qing immediately became extremely dissatisfied with me and harbored resentment. On the morning of April 17th, after Ji Kaifu was arrested for the second time, Wang Qing came to warn me: "Lao Sun! To be honest with you, I am very dissatisfied with you for reporting the situation to the District Committee and bailing out Ji Kaifu. Now Ji Kaifu was arrested by the Security Section, and the problem is not simple!" The meaning was that there were political issues and told me not to interfere anymore. These tactics of theirs could not prevent me from continuing to understand the case. Later, Song Ying and Wang Qing suddenly convened a meeting of all employees in the hospital on April 19th, organizing some people to attack me and forcing me to admit my "mistakes" in public. At this time, I thought that in order to be responsible to the Party, I should abandon all concerns and fight. Therefore, taking advantage of their forcing me to "admit my mistakes," I systematically explained the entire situation of the embezzlement case at the meeting. At that time, some of the parties involved also came forward to supplement the situation and raised doubts, which aroused the attention of most of the masses. At this time, Wang Qing used the signboard of "old cadre" as a cover, and a comrade from the Public Security Bureau directly pointed out that the embezzlement case was a "political frame-up." During the summary of the meeting, someone even said: "Now is the period of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, Wang Qing is the secretary of the Party branch, we should check within the Party for any problems!" attempting to suppress me and suppress the masses from speaking. The next day, another meeting was held to launch a slanderous attack on me. At the meeting, some comrades repeatedly asked to talk about the embezzlement case, demanding "let us also speak," but they were immediately turned back. At that time, I thought that even if Song Ying, Wang Qing, and others could act tyrannically for a while, the truth could not be suppressed, and the truth of the case could not deceive the masses, let alone the Party. Later, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee transferred the case to the Public Security Bureau, and Song Ying and Wang Qing intensified their slanderous attacks, spreading rumors everywhere, saying that I had "political conspiracies," "Sun Mailing is despicable and龌龊" and spreading rumors that "Ji Kaifu has been bailed out by the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee Discipline Inspection Office and is now working in the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee" to confuse the masses. At this time, I realized that this was no longer a question of whether the embezzlement case itself was complicated, but a question of how to view the embezzlement case; it was not a simple case-solving problem, but a serious ideological struggle. In addition to helping the people who came to investigate the case to understand and collect materials, and trying my best to talk to Wang Qing, understanding his situation, and persuading him to actively help solve the case, and hoping to inspire him to confess; on the other hand, I wrote a more detailed material, in addition to sending it to the Wuhan Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee Discipline Inspection Commission, I also sent a copy to the Central China Bureau Discipline Inspection Commission, and requested that someone be sent to the hospital to mobilize the masses to conduct investigation and handling.

    At this time, Song Ying, Wang Qing, and others continued to use deception, instigation, and co-option to attack and soften me. Last July, Song Ying and Wang Qing used their authority to send Wang Yinan under the pretext of inspection work to unreasonably record a major demerit against me. I refused to accept it and filed a complaint with the Wuhan Fourth District Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Personnel Bureau. The Personnel Bureau ignored it. When the Fourth District Committee sent someone to investigate, Song Ying and Wang Qing shirked their responsibilities. Wang Qing also said to me: "Lao Sun, you are upright and enthusiastic about things, and it is good to take care of things when you see something wrong, but you must know that we cannot rely on Party spirit to eat!" But I was not intimidated or deceived by their various insidious means. I knew very well that the occurrence of the embezzlement case had caused great damage to the Party's political influence, and the masses felt a great threat due to the domineering style of Wang Qing and Song Ying. There was a general idea of ​​"better to do less than more," and their thoughts were very confused, their spirits were suppressed, which seriously affected the work, and many people wanted to leave the Second Hospital.

    Therefore, I believed that if the embezzlement case was not resolved, all other problems would be unsolvable. So I continued to investigate and study the embezzlement case. On the one hand, I checked my shortcomings (mainly being detached from the masses), and on the other hand, I re-organized a complete written material on the embezzlement case and other related issues and sent it to the Central China Bureau Discipline Inspection Commission, the Central Organization Department, and the People's Daily. I believed that the Party would quickly resolve this issue.

    Facts have proved that my idea was correct. Soon after, the Party organized a joint inspection team to come to our hospital to mobilize the masses to conduct a comprehensive investigation, so that the embezzlement case was quickly brought to light and a correct conclusion was made.

    Throughout the entire process of this case, I had shortcomings. Because I had the problem of being detached from the masses in my usual work style, Song Ying, Wang Qing, and others had the opportunity to take advantage of this, using some "confidants" to distort the facts and deceive some of the masses to "attack" me. I did not rely on the masses in the struggle, dispel their concerns, and mobilize them to fight against the anti-Party elements well enough. Sometimes I also had some concerns myself, so the struggle was not active and powerful enough. These shortcomings show that I have not fulfilled my due responsibilities to the Party.

    In addition, after the embezzlement case occurred, I was very disgusted with Wang Qing's degeneration, embezzlement of public funds, and framing of others, but I did not fully understand Song Ying's mistakes. Since the newspaper announced the Central China Bureau's decision on the embezzlement case, the entire process of the case, and Wang Qing's confession, I realized that Wang Qing's degeneration should be entirely his own responsibility. As for the serious crimes of framing others, refusing to confess, and spreading rumors everywhere, Song Ying is responsible for a large part of it. Starting from personal prejudices, Song Ying initially suppressed democracy and attacked criticism, and then used his authority to infringe on human rights and frame good people. Even after the higher authorities sternly pointed out his mistakes, he still refused to admit his mistakes and resisted the organization. This is a domineering style and anti-Party activity. The seriousness of this error lies not in the error of an individual, but in the support and consistent errors of certain organizations and personnel. Therefore, the political loss caused by this error to the Party and the People's Government is very great.

    The entire embezzlement case and the decision of the Central China Bureau educated us that in the struggle for truth, we must stand on the Party's position, proceed from the Party's interests, trust and rely on the Party, be realistic, and rely on and mobilize the masses. In the future, I will earnestly accept past experiences, correct the shortcomings of being detached from the masses, and more actively fight for the cause of the Party.

    我怎样坚持党的原则和宋瑛、王清等进行斗争的
    武汉市立第二医院医务科长  孙麦龄
    武汉市立第二医院的盗款案，经过了十个月的曲折过程，终于真相大白。中共中央中南局对该案作出了正确的决定，并给予周季方、宋瑛、王清以开除党籍的处分，是完全正确和必要的，我完全拥护。在本院盗款案发生以后，纪凯夫被押的期间，我也是始终被宋瑛、王清等所痛恨的，一直受到他们的诬蔑、打击，他们甚至还企图陷害我。今天切身体会起来，因为我有切身的体验，所以看到党组织对这一案件的正确处理，更深深地感觉到党的纪律严肃、是非分明和大公无私。
    去年四月十二日下午武汉市立第二医院发生了盗款案，这时候医院正在进行整顿，并已开始了镇压反革命的学习。过去本院一向多事，这案件又十分突出，全院同志对此特别关心，都有决心要搞个水落石出。因为事件很严重，除王清以外我是本院较负责的党员干部，但因对案情了解不足，所以决定先弄清案情再说。
    纪凯夫的突然被捕，一时使我迷惑。根据案情，纪凯夫是盗窃犯的可能性很小。接着在第二医院流传一种“政治性陷害”的说法。怎样来解决这一个疑问呢？我想只要依靠党，依靠组织没有不能解决的问题。我就去找中南局纪律检查委员会李之琏秘书长和中共武汉市第四区区委书记苏苇同志，他们给了我许多帮助，指示我要放弃一切“先入之见”，客观地、实事求是地来处理这一问题。在整个斗争过程中，他们一直在原则上，思想上给我许多帮助和鼓励，这样我就增加了斗争的决心和勇气。我首先认定，不管盗款案是什么性质的，只要先抓住盗款犯，其他问题都会解决；因此我一方面继续调查案情，一方面整理一些已有的材料，对每一件材料都加以反复的对证，有些还加以实地试验，务使件件真实，对纪凯夫的历史也进行了调查。
    材料有了一些，就要找关键寻线索，研究偷钱的人可能在那里？根据各方面的人证物证以及当时现场情况，我认为王清的嫌疑最大。对于这些情况以及案件经过，我在四区委召开的会议上据实作了报告。及公安四分局第一次释放了纪凯夫，立即引起了宋瑛、王清对我的极度不满和怀恨。四月十七日上午纪凯夫第二次被捕后，王清就来警告我：“老孙！老实对你说，你向区委反映情况和保释纪凯夫，我对你十分不满，现在纪凯夫是保卫处抓去的，问题不简单！”意思是有政治问题，叫我别再管。他们的这些手段并不能阻挠我继续对此案的了解。以后宋瑛、王清突然在四月十九日召开了全院全体职工大会，组织一些人对我进行攻击，强迫我当众承认“错误”。这时我想为了对党负责，应抛弃一切顾虑进行斗争。因此，我就乘他们强迫我“认错”的机会，在大会上有系统地把盗款案全部情况作了交代，当时还有一部分当事人起来补充情况，并提出了怀疑，引起了多数群众的注意。这时王清就用 “老干部”的招牌来作掩饰，公安局的一个同志则直截了当地指盗款案是“政治陷害”，在会议总结时有人并说：“现在是镇压反革命期间，王清是党支部书记，应该从党内检查一下有无问题！”企图压我，并压制群众不许讲话。第二天又召开大会，向我进行诬蔑性的攻击。会上，也有的同志不止一次地提出要讲盗款案，要求“让我们也讲讲话”，但立即被打了回去。当时我想纵然宋瑛、王清等可以霸行一时，但真理是压制不了的，案情真相绝对欺骗不了群众，更欺骗不了党。后来中共武汉市委又将案件移交到公安局，宋瑛、王清更变本加厉地扩大诬蔑性的攻击，到处诬告，到处散布说我有“政治阴谋”，“孙麦龄卑鄙龌龊”等等，并散布“纪凯夫已为武汉市委纪律检查处保释，现在武汉市委工作”的谣言来迷惑群众。这时候我体会到，这已经不是盗款案本身是否复杂的问题，而是对盗款案的看法问题；不是单纯的破案问题，而是一场严重的思想斗争。我除一方面帮助来调查案件的人了解和收集材料，尽可能地找王清谈话，了解他的情况，并劝他积极地帮助破案，同时希望启发他坦白；另一方面，我写了一份比较详细的材料，除送给武汉市公安总局，武汉市委纪律检查委员会以外，也送了一份给中南局纪律检查委员会，并提出请求派人来医院发动群众进行调查处理。
    宋瑛、王清等这时继续用欺骗、挑拨和拉拢的手段来打击和软化我。去年七月，宋瑛、王清利用职权派王一南借检查工作为名，无理地记我大过一次。我不服，向武汉市第四区委和武汉市人事局进行控告。人事局并未理睬。第四区委派人前来调查时，宋瑛、王清推卸了他们应负的责任。王清并对我说：“老孙，你对事正直热心，见不对就要管是好的，但是你要知道，我们是不能凭党性来吃饭的！”但我没有被他们各种阴险的手段所吓退和蒙蔽，我很知道盗款案的发生已使党的政治影响蒙受了极大的损失，群众由于王清、宋瑛的恶霸作风感受到很大的威胁，普遍地存在着多一事不如少一事的想法，思想十分混乱，精神受到压抑，严重地影响了工作，不少人想离开第二医院。
    因此，我认为盗款案不解决，其他一切问题也就无从解决。所以我仍继续对盗款案进行调查研究，一方面检查自己的缺点（主要是脱离群众），一方面重新整理了一份完整的盗款案情和其他有关问题的书面材料送给中南局纪律检查委员会、中央组织部和人民日报。我相信党会很快地处理这一个问题。
    事实证明，我的想法是正确的。不久之后，党就组织了联合检查组来到本院发动群众进行全面调查，使盗款案很快的水落石出，作出了正确的结论。
    在此案的整个过程中，我是存在着缺点的。因为我在平时作风上存在着脱离群众的毛病，因此宋瑛、王清等有机可乘，可以利用一些“心腹人”，来歪曲事实，欺骗一些群众对我“进攻”。我在斗争中依靠群众，打消群众顾虑，发动他们一起向反党分子作斗争也很不够。有时候自己也存在着一些顾虑，因此斗争不够主动和有力，这些缺点说明我还没有对党尽到我应尽的责任。
    此外，在盗款案发生后，我对王清的蜕化堕落，盗窃公款并嫁祸于人的行为是十分痛恨的，但对宋瑛的错误则认识不足，自从报上公布了中南局对盗款案的决定、全案经过和王清的供词后，我认识到王清蜕化堕落应由他自己完全负责，至于嫁祸于人，拒不坦白，到处诬告等严重的罪行，宋瑛则负很大部分的责任。宋瑛由个人成见出发，始则压制民主打击批评，继而利用职权，侵犯人权，陷害好人，虽经上级严厉地指出他的错误，还是坚不认错抵抗组织，这是一种恶霸作风和反党活动。这错误的严重性还在于不是个别的人的错误，而是通过了某些组织和人员的支持和一贯的错误。因此这个错误所造成的对党对人民政府的政治损失是很大的。
    整个的盗款案和中南局的决定教育了我们，在为真理而斗争中间，必须站在党的立场，从党的利益出发，信任党和倚靠党，要实事求是，并且要依靠群众，发动群众。今后我要好好地接受过去的经验，纠正脱离群众的缺点，更积极地为党的事业而斗争。
