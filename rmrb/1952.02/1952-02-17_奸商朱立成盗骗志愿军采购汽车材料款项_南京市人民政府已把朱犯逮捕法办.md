    Profiteer Zhu Licheng Embezzles and Swindles Funds for the Volunteer Army's Purchase of Automobile Materials
    Nanjing Municipal People's Government Arrests and Punishes the Criminal Zhu
    The Nanjing Municipal People's Government arrested Zhu Licheng, manager of the Global Automobile Materials Firm, on the 10th. Profiteer Zhu Licheng has consistently stolen state property, and what is most intolerable is that the criminal Zhu actually defrauded the Chinese People's Volunteer Army of military funds, directly undermining the Resist America, Aid Korea movement. Last December, procurement personnel from the Volunteer Army purchased a batch of automobile materials from the Global Automobile Materials Firm, including carburetors, distributors and other materials worth approximately 100 million yuan. Zhu Licheng collected a batch of used goods from used goods stalls, slightly refurbished them, and then passed them off as new goods to sell to the Volunteer Army. The carburetors already had cracks, but Zhu Licheng repaired the surface and sold them to the Volunteer Army as new goods. At that time, the general price for each carburetor was only 480,000 yuan, but Zhu Licheng demanded 600,000 yuan from the Volunteer Army. Someone warned him: "The Volunteer Army is fighting arduously in the freezing cold, and our support for them is too poor. How can you bear to sell bad things as good things to them? Bad carburetors will malfunction in the cold of Korea. If they malfunction, the vehicles will break down, which will affect military transport!" The criminal Zhu said with utter disregard for conscience: "It doesn't matter, they are not used here anyway, who cares!"
    After the launch of the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-embezzlement of state property, anti-shoddy workmanship, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence campaign in Nanjing's industrial and commercial circles, the criminal Zhu refused to confess his crimes and repeatedly colluded with bribe-takers to form a "defense alliance". At the same time, he used salary increases to buy off apprentices, attempting to conceal his crimes. At the Nanjing industrial and commercial circles mobilization meeting held on February 6th, the presidium of the meeting, based on mass accusations and requests, named Zhu and set a deadline of four days for him to thoroughly confess. When the deadline of the 10th had passed, Zhu still refused to confess. Therefore, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government immediately arrested and punished the criminal Zhu according to the law.

    奸商朱立成盗骗志愿军采购汽车材料款项
    南京市人民政府已把朱犯逮捕法办
    南京市人民政府十日逮捕了全球汽车材料行经理朱立成。奸商朱立成一贯盗窃国家财产，而最令人不能容忍的是，朱犯竟诈骗中国人民志愿军军用款项，直接破坏抗美援朝运动。去年十二月间，志愿军采购人员向全球汽车材料行购置一批汽车材料，其中化油器、断电器等材料约值一亿元左右。朱立成从旧货摊上收来了一批旧货，略加整饰后就冒充新货卖给志愿军。化油器上边已经有了裂缝，朱立成把它表面修好，也当作新货卖给志愿军。当时一般货价每只化油器只需四十八万元，而朱立成竟向志愿军索价六十万元。有人曾警告他：“志愿军在冰天雪地中艰苦作战，我们对他们的支援太差了，你怎么还忍心把坏东西冒充好东西卖给他们？坏的化油器在寒冷的朝鲜会出毛病的，一出毛病，车子抛锚，影响军运可怎得了！”朱犯竟丧尽天良地说：“不要紧，反正不在此地用，管他的呢！”
    南京市工商界反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动开展后，朱犯对自己的罪行拒不坦白，并一再拉拢受贿人员订立“攻守同盟”，同时用加薪办法，收买学徒，企图隐瞒他的罪行。在二月六日举行的南京市工商界动员大会上，大会主席团根据群众的检举和要求，曾点名限期朱犯在四天内彻底坦白。到十日期限已满，可是朱犯仍拒不坦白。因此，南京市人民政府即将朱犯逮捕法办。
