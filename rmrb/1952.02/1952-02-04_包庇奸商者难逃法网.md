    Those Who Shield Profiteers Cannot Escape the Law
    To the Editor: Zhong Zhaozhong (a Communist Party member) is the accountant of the Qiantai Shan Grain Store in the Seventh District of Beijing. He has consistently colluded with the capitalist, oppressing the workers. Last September, he used illegal means to dismiss the worker Cui Fu. Therefore, the workers all call him "Second Boss". After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he knew that the capitalist was engaged in tax evasion, but he did not actively report it. The Beijing Seventh District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party repeatedly educated and mobilized him to expose the illegal activities of the capitalist, but he has always adopted an attitude of shielding and concealing. On January 21st, Zheng Wencheng and other workers of the Qiantai Shan Grain Store reported 18 criminal acts of the capitalist, such as bribery, tax evasion, and tax avoidance. Afraid of being reported himself, he threatened Zheng Wencheng, saying: "You dare to report me! Fine, let's go to the police station to sue, and see who gets detained." On the 22nd, he shamelessly instigated his wife to seduce Zheng Wencheng and falsely accused Zheng of molesting his wife. The Beijing Seventh District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Seventh District Food Industry Union unanimously ordered him to make a public self-criticism. At the self-criticism meeting, he still quibbled and denied, stubbornly refusing to admit his mistakes. The masses present were very indignant at this lawless element who sabotaged the movement and demanded that the People's Government arrest him. The People's Government accepted this request and arrested him on the spot. Everyone jumped for joy, realizing that those who shield profiteers and sabotage the movement cannot escape the law.

    包庇奸商者难逃法网
    编辑同志：种兆栋（共产党员）是北京市第七区乾泰山粮食店的管账员。他一贯勾结资方，欺压工人。去年九月，他曾使用非法手段，解雇了工人崔富。因此，工人们都叫他“二掌柜”。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，他明知资方有偷税、漏税行为，但不积极检举。中共北京市第七区委员会再三教育和动员他，揭发资方不法行为，但他一直是采取包庇和隐瞒的态度。一月二十一日，乾泰山粮食店的工人郑文成等检举了资方十八件行贿、偷税、漏税等犯罪事实，他怕也被检举，就威吓郑文成说：“你敢检举我！好，我们到派出所打官司去，看谁被扣押。”二十二日，他更无耻地嗾使他的老婆勾搭郑文成，并诬蔑郑调戏他的老婆。中共北京市第七区委员会和第七区食品业工会一致责成他作公开检讨。在检讨大会上，他仍狡辩、抵赖，坚不承认自己的错误。在场群众对这种破坏运动的不法分子非常愤慨，要求人民政府把他逮捕。人民政府接受了这个要求，当场逮捕了他。大家高兴得跳起来，都认识到：包庇奸商、破坏运动的人是难逃法网的。    北京市第七区食品业工会
