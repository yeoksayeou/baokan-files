    Random Thoughts on Hitting "Tigers" - Five Essays
    Zang Kejia
    "Tiger" Compared to Tiger
    We call corrupt officials "tigers," and the metaphor is profound in terms of their ferocity. But comparing "tiger" to tiger, the "tiger" inside the parentheses is far more dangerous than the tiger in the mountains.

    When the tiger in the mountains wants to eat someone, it first bares its fangs and claws, roaring menacingly: "I'm going to eat you!" After eating, the traces of flesh and blood remain on its muzzle, serving as a mark of responsibility for its actions.

    But the "tiger" hides itself, appearing in "human" form, some hidden in the clothing of cadres, wearing badges on their chests, carrying passes at their waists, entering and leaving revolutionary agencies and organizations, engaging in activities that harm the people in the name of serving the people, doing it so "cleanly," so self-righteously.

    When the people point at it and shout to hit the "tiger," it adapts to the situation and immediately becomes a "fox." Cunning, denying, swearing oaths, even shedding tears to prove its "truthfulness." Whether out of softheartedness or due to considerations of personal relations, if its "truthfulness" is believed, then its ugly, criminal truth will be concealed.

    For the old "tiger," only mobilizing the masses, pursuing and attacking fiercely will work; showing pity is a mistake. We must present the deeds it has committed, one by one, as they truly are! These materials, of course, have no mouths, but it has an iron face.

    "Wind" from "Tiger"

    "Wind" comes from "tiger." We can often trace "tigers" from the "wind."

    Large corrupt elements—"tigers"—although they vary in size, carry the same "greed" on their bodies: that is, eating, drinking, playing, indulging in a corrupt and degenerate style, and probably very few actually use the embezzled money to buy gold bars and bury them underground for their descendants to spend in the socialist era.

    When we hit "tigers," we must have the ability to hear "tigers" from the "wind." His income is limited, but his extravagance is great; to a vigilant ear, this is the sound of "wind." This "wind" comes from a "hole," and this "hole" is bourgeois ideology.

    After hitting the "tiger," we must plug this "hole," otherwise there will be endless troubles.

    "Not that bad, is it?"

    You say "dare to doubt," but when this theory is applied to a specific person, it is no longer "daring," and a doubting tail is added to your "doubt": "He's not that bad, is he?" After listening to the corrupt official's "confession," you think it's "almost" done,

    "Not that" there's anything more, is there? This kind of kindhearted thought of being afraid of wrongly accusing a good person fully demonstrates the weakness of combat effectiveness. This question mark is equivalent to giving the enemy a way out.

    For those in a suspicious position, we must have the spirit and courage to "dare to doubt." Facts have proven to us more than once: very few people who handle a lot of money do not get tainted with the smell of money.

    The Hardness of Money

    Shakespeare's lines cursing gold through the mouth of "Timon of Athens" are extremely famous, with profound meaning, incisive words, and a sonorous and moving sound. If Shakespeare were alive today, he could enrich the lines even more with his justice and indignation.

    We see that the bourgeoisie's golden bullets have hit the literary and artistic fields, which have always been considered noble and pure. The souls of the "engineers of the human soul" have also been smoked black. Orchestral music is certainly not as pleasing and comforting to Yang Pei as the clinking of money; Liu Xian's thoughts were shattered upon contact with money. If we were to give him a pear wood board and a steel knife again today, I don't know how he would wield it.

    "Engineers of the human soul," be vigilant! In the corners of our souls, there may be a "tiger" lurking there.

    The Issue of Face

    Many corrupt officials do not confess or do not confess thoroughly, worrying about "three losses"—losing their lives, losing their wealth (recovering赃款), and losing face.

    For some corrupt officials, losing face, although slightly better than losing their heads, is still very painful and hard to give up: face is equal to a second life.

    "A person without a face is like a tree without bark." Face is certainly important, but now, face is no longer an issue, because it has already been completely lost.

    Of course, when the corrupt official's black hand was grabbing a handful, he not only didn't forget his face, but also tried his best to maintain it. Because the stolen goods are in the pocket, and the face is exposed on the outside. In this way, he believes that face and sin can not infringe on each other. He has both the "revolutionary" face and the material benefits of a bourgeois life, achieving two things at once.

    Suddenly, an anti-corruption movement comes along, and it insists on linking past actions with face. As a result, face begins to become a problem.

    In fact, it's good to lose this kind of face. Wearing a false mask of flesh is not only ridiculous but also a painful burden.

    Confess! Pour out the dirty things in your entrails, make the inside and outside bright and clean, a new person, a new face, add glory to it bit by bit with the merits of serving the people, and the people will look at you with different eyes.

    Losing face is the only way to regain face.

### 打“虎”随笔五题

    打“虎”随笔五题
    臧克家
    “虎”比虎
    我们呼贪污分子为“虎”，就其凶猛一点讲，这比喻的意义是深刻的。但将“虎”比虎，这括弧里边的“虎”却比山林里的虎危险得多了。
    山林里的虎，它要吃人的时候，先张牙舞爪，呼啸逞威：“我要吃你！”吃过之后，口吻上留下血肉的残痕，作为对自己行为负责的标志。
    而“虎”呢，却把自己隐藏起来，而以“人”形出现，有的隐藏在干部的服装里，胸前挂着徽章，腰里带着出入证，出入革命的机关、团体，以为人民服务的名义作着危害人民的勾当，作得那么“干净”，那么心安理得。
    当人民指着它大喊打“虎”的时候，它随机应变，立刻又成为一条“狐”了。狡猾、抵赖、发誓、甚至叫眼泪来证实它的“真实”，不论是由于心肠软或是由于情面关系听信了它的这“真实”，那它丑恶、犯罪的真实就被隐瞒过了。
    对于老“虎”只有发动群众，穷追猛击，悯怜就是错误。我们把它曾经作过的勾当一桩一桩如实地摊在它眼前！这些材料当然没长口，但它却有一张铁面。
    “风”从“虎”
    “风”从“虎”。我们往往从“风”里可以追出“虎”来。
    大贪污分子——“虎”，虽然有大小之分，但它们身上带着的“贪”却是一样的：那便是吃、喝、玩、乐，腐化堕落的一派歪风，真正把贪污的资财买成金条，埋在地底下留给他几代子孙在社会主义时代去花销的恐怕很少。
    我们打“虎”，须有从“风”里听出“虎”来的本领。他的收入是有数的，而挥霍得却很大度，对于一只警惕的耳朵这就是一阵“风”声。这种“风”是从一个“空穴”里来的，这“空穴”便是资产阶级思想。
    打了“虎”，必须塞死这“空穴”，否则后祸无穷。
    “不至于吧？”
    口里讲着“大胆怀疑”，但当这理论按在具体的人身上时，便不再“大胆”，而且在自己的“怀疑”后边加上一条怀疑的尾巴：他“不至于吧？”听了贪污分子的“坦白”，就认为已经“差不多”了，
    “不至于”再有什么了吧？这种恐怕冤枉了好人的厚道想法，十足地表现了战斗性的低弱，这一个“？”号对于敌人就等于网开一面。
    对处在可疑地位上的人，我们要有“大胆怀疑”的精神和勇气。事实不止一次给我们证明了：大量经手钱财的人而手上不沾上铜臭的很少，很少。
    金钱的硬度
    莎士比亚借“雅典人台蒙”的口诅咒黄金的那些诗句，是极为有名的，意深语切，铿锵动人。如果莎士比亚活在今天的话，他可以凭着他的正义和愤懑把诗句更丰富起来。
    我们看到，资产阶级的金弹打到一向被认为清高纯洁的文艺领域里来了。“人类灵魂工程师”的灵魂也被熏成了黑色。管弦乐对于杨培一定没有金钱的叮咚声悦耳舒心；刘岘的思想，在和金钱一碰之下，便被粉碎了。如果今天我们再把梨木板子和钢刀送给他，不知道他将如何掌握它。
    “人类灵魂的工程师”，警惕呵！在我们灵魂深处的角落里，可能就有只“虎”伏在那里。
    面子问题
    许多贪污分子不坦白或不彻底坦白，顾虑在“三丢”——丢命，丢财（追赃），丢面子。
    对于一部分贪污分子来说，丢面子比丢脑袋虽略胜一筹，然而实在痛切切地舍不得：面子就等于第二生命。
    “人没脸，树没皮”，面子当然要紧，然而，事到如今，面子已经不成问题，因为它早已丢完了。
    当然，当贪污分子的黑手在满把抓的时候，他不但没忘掉他的面子，还想竭力维持它。因为赃在腰包里，而面子却露在外边。这样，他以为面子和罪恶可以互不侵犯。既有“革命”的面子，又有资产阶级生活的实惠，一举而两得。
    偏偏来个反贪污运动，硬要把过去所作所为和面子连在一起。于是，面子开始成为问题。
    实际上，这种面子丢了倒好，戴着肉的假面具，不但滑稽而且是一种痛苦的担负。
    坦白吧！把脏腑里的肮脏东西倒干净，里表亮堂堂，新的人，新的面子，用为人民服务的劳绩给它一点一点地添光彩，人民会用另一副眼光来看你。
    丢掉面子才能找回面子。
