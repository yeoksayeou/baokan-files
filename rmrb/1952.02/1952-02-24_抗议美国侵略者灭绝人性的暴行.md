    Protest Against the Inhumane Atrocities of the American Aggressors
    The inhumane American aggressors are now further recklessly violating human justice and international law by using bacteriological warfare on our army's front lines in Korea. In the twenty days from January 28th to February 17th this year, the American invading army used aircraft on eight separate occasions to scatter various germ-carrying insects over our front-line positions and rear areas, plotting to create deadly infectious diseases such as plague and cholera in order to massacre on a large scale the peaceful residents of Korea and the Chinese and Korean People's forces. The American aggressors also barbarously and cruelly used captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army as experimental subjects for studying bacteriological warfare. In March of last year, the American aggressors sent a bacteriological landing craft outside Wonsan Harbor to conduct this heinous experiment using captured personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army; later, this landing craft went to Geoje Island in southern Korea to conduct the same experiment using captured personnel of the Korean People's Army. According to American newspapers, on Geoje Island, this experiment was conducted three thousand times a day, resulting in 1,400 of the more than 125,000 captured personnel of the Korean People's Army becoming seriously ill; approximately 80 percent of the rest were also infected with various diseases. These despicable atrocities of the American aggressors were carried out in collusion with Japanese bacteriological war criminals Shirō Ishii, Jirō Wakamatsu, and Masazo Kitano. These Japanese war criminals used bacteriological weapons against the Chinese people during the Japanese invasion of China, killing tens of thousands of Chinese people by spreading plague, cholera, and other toxic bacteria.
    These facts once again prove that the American aggressors, in a vain attempt to salvage their military defeats and to prepare for new and even more brutal wars of aggression, have become so insane as to have completely lost their humanity, have become rabid dogs, and are utter enemies of mankind.
    The brutal, insane, savage, and despicable enemy has openly committed atrocities that are beneath contempt. Our patriotic compatriots across the country must always remember the enemy's heinous crimes and must stand together with the Korean people and peace-loving people around the world to resolutely sanction the mortal enemy of human justice—the American aggressors—and severely punish the American bacteriological war criminals and Japanese bacteriological war criminals.
    The American aggressors' use of bacteriological weapons in warfare, or the commission of any other savage atrocities, can only arouse the hatred and anger of hundreds of millions of Chinese people, Korean people, and people of conscience, and can never save their war of aggression from defeat. The American aggressors will not be able to escape criminal responsibility for using bacteriological weapons in warfare, and they will certainly be subjected to just and severe sanctions by the Chinese and Korean people and the people of the world.

### 抗议美国侵略者灭绝人性的暴行

    抗议美国侵略者灭绝人性的暴行
    灭绝人性的美国侵略者，现在又进一步穷凶极恶地违反人类正义和国际公法，在朝鲜我军前线使用细菌作战。从今年一月二十八日到二月十七日为止的二十天之内，美国侵略军先后八次使用飞机向我方的前线阵地和后方，撒放传布细菌的各种毒虫，阴谋制造鼠疫、霍乱等烈性传染病来大规模地屠杀朝鲜的和平居民和中朝人民部队。美国侵略者并且野蛮残暴地把中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军的被俘人员作为研究细菌作战的实验品。去年三月间美国侵略者就曾派了一只细菌登陆艇到元山港外，以中国人民志愿军被俘人员来作这种罪恶的实验；以后这只登陆艇又到朝鲜南部的巨济岛，以朝鲜人民军被俘人员来作同样的试验。据美国报纸透露，在巨济岛，这种试验每天要进行三千次，结果使得十二万五千多朝鲜人民军被俘人员中，有一千四百人病得很厉害；其余的人也大约有百分之八十染有各种疾病。美国侵略者这种卑鄙的暴行，是勾结日本细菌战犯石井四郎、若松次郎和北野政藏等一起进行的。这些日本战犯在日本侵略中国的时期曾对中国人民使用过细菌武器，用传布鼠疫、霍乱等毒菌的办法，杀害过成千成万的中国人民。
    这些事实又一次证明，美国侵略者妄想挽救它的军事惨败，为了准备新的更加残酷的侵略战争，已经疯狂到完全丧尽人性的地步，已经变成了一条疯狗，十足的人类公敌。
    残暴、疯狂、野蛮、卑鄙的敌人，已经公然做出不齿于人类的暴行来了。我们全国爱国的同胞们，一定要永远记住敌人的万恶罪行，一定要和朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人民在一起，坚决制裁人类正义的死敌——美国侵略者，严惩美国细菌战犯和日本细菌战犯。
    美国侵略者使用细菌武器作战，或者是从事别的任何野蛮暴行，只能激起千千万万的中国人民、朝鲜人民和有良知的人类的憎恨和愤怒，而决不能挽救它的侵略战争的失败。美国侵略者决不能逃脱使用细菌武器作战的犯罪责任，他们一定要受到中朝人民和全世界人民的正义的严厉制裁。
