    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 23rd] To swiftly reach an agreement on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations, our side proposed a rotation limit of 30,000 people per month and a number of five specific ports per side at the staff meeting on February 22nd. The plan proposed by our side already constituted a sufficient and reasonable solution to the rotation issue and the rear port issue, but the other side still insisted on a rotation limit of 35,000 people per month and a number of six specific ports per side. In order to eliminate all excuses for the other side to continue delaying the armistice negotiations, our side proposed a compromise of a rotation limit of 35,000 people per month and a number of five specific ports per side at the staff meeting on the 23rd. Our side solemnly pointed out that our side has made every possible effort and that there can be no further dispute on the issue of rotation and ports. Our side once again demanded that the other side withdraw its unreasonable opposition to the neutral countries nominated by our side.
    At the Fourth Agenda Item Staff Meeting, our staff pointed out that the other side's so-called "voluntary repatriation" claim has not only long hindered the progress of the armistice negotiations, but has also caused serious crimes. Last December, due to the other side's conspiracy to carry out so-called "voluntary repatriation" in its prisoner-of-war camps, the Geoji Island massacre of our prisoners of war occurred. The bloodstains of the last massacre had not yet dried, and recently this crime has developed anew. Our staff was instructed to lodge the following serious protest to the other side regarding the recent barbaric massacre of our captured personnel on Geoji Island: "I am instructed to lodge a serious protest against your barbaric massacre of a large number of our captured personnel detained on Geoji Island in the bloody incident of February 18th. This recent massacre fully demonstrates the extreme cruelty of your side's treatment of our captured personnel, exposes all the lies made by your side at the conference table about how well our captured personnel are treated, and declares the complete bankruptcy of your side's absurd principle of so-called 'voluntary repatriation' before all conscientious people in the world. Our side will never recognize your reclassification of our captured military personnel as civilians. Our side demands that you provide full materials on more than 44,000 of our captured personnel, including full materials on our captured personnel massacred by your side this time. You must provide a clear explanation for this group of massacred captured personnel. You must never use any reclassification nonsense to cover up your heinous crimes. We will continue to accuse you before the people of the world. I now solemnly declare that our side reserves the right to pursue accountability for this intolerable bloody incident."
    Editor's note: According to the communique of the 23rd, the two issues of rotation and ports have not yet been resolved. The communique of the 22nd said, "We believe that the rotation issue has been reasonably resolved, and that the port issue has also been reasonably resolved due to our side's concessions." This only says "We believe" it has been resolved, not that it has actually been resolved. Therefore, the subtitle of the report on the Korean negotiations published in this newspaper on the 23rd, which stated that "the port issue has been reasonably resolved" is incorrect and is hereby corrected.

    美方对待我方被俘人员残无人道
    竟制造巨济岛屠杀我战俘事件
    我方在第四项议程参谋会议上提出严重抗议，并声明对此血腥事件保留追究的权利
    【新华社开城二十三日电】为迅速达成朝鲜停战谈判中第三项议程的协议，我方已在二月二十二日的参谋会议上提出每月三万人的轮换限额和每方五个特定口岸的数目。我方所提出的方案本已构成轮换问题与后方口岸问题的充分而合理的解决方案，但对方却仍然坚持每月三万五千人的轮换限额和每方六个特定口岸的数字。为解除对方继续拖延停战谈判的一切藉口，我方在二十三日的参谋会议上又提出了每月三万五千人轮换限额和每方五个特定口岸的折衷方案。我方郑重指出我方已竭尽一切可能的努力，在轮换与口岸问题上不可能再有任何的争执，我方并再次要求对方撤消对我方所提名的中立国的无理反对。
    第四项议程参谋会议上，我方参谋人员指出对方所坚持的所谓“自愿遣返”的主张，不仅长期阻滞了停战谈判的进展，而且造成了严重的罪行。在去年十二月由于对方在其战俘营进行所谓“自愿遣返”的阴谋策动，造成了巨济岛的屠杀我战俘的事件，上次屠杀的血迹未干，到最近这种罪行又有了新的发展。我方参谋人员奉命就最近对方在巨济岛野蛮地屠杀我方被俘人员事件向对方提出下列的严重抗议：“我奉命对二月十八日你方野蛮地屠杀被拘留在巨济岛上的大批我方被俘人员的流血事件提出严重抗议。最近这次的屠杀事件充分证明了你方对待我方被俘人员的残无人道，揭穿了你方在会议桌上所作的关于如何优待我方被俘人员的一切谎言，更在全世界一切有良心的人民面前宣布了你方所谓‘自愿遣返’的荒谬原则的彻底破产。我方从不承认你方将我方被俘军事人员重新分类为平民。我方要求你方提供四万四千余我方被俘人员的充分材料，包括此次被你方屠杀的我方被俘人员的充分材料，你方必须对这批被屠杀的我方被俘人员交代清楚。你们绝不能用什么重新分类的鬼话掩盖你们的滔天罪行。我们将继续在全世界人民面前控告你们。我现在郑重声明对于这一令人不能容忍的血腥事件我方保留提出追究的权利。”
    编者按：根据二十三日的公报，轮换和口岸两个问题，仍未获得解决。二十二日的公报说“我们认为轮换问题已经获得了合理的解决，在口岸问题上由于我方的让步也已经获得了合理的解决。”这只是说“我们认为”已经解决，并不是实际上已经解决。因此，本报二十三日登载的关于朝鲜谈判公报的副题中所称“口岸问题已获得合理解决”是不对的，特此更正。
