    Xinxiang City Prison Production Section
    Illegally Fails to Fulfill Hemp Purchase Contract
    Editor: The Xinxiang City People's Government Prison Production Section in Pingyuan Province, fails to fulfill the hemp purchase contract signed with the Zhumadian City Trading Branch at the Zhumadian Materials Exchange Conference, seriously affecting the capital turnover of state-owned trading enterprises. The Xinxiang City Prison Production Section was invited to participate in the Zhumadian Materials Exchange Conference in October last year and ordered 100,000 catties of white autumn hemp from the Zhumadian City Trading Branch. After the representatives of both parties reached a consensus on specifications, prices, delivery time, location, and procedures, they went to the trade office of the conference to sign a trade contract; the contract stipulated that the buyer must go to the Zhumadian City Trading Branch to pay and pick up the goods on November 9, 1951, but it has been two months overdue and they have not sent anyone to handle it. The City Trading Branch has sent letters to the Xinxiang City People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government Department of Commerce several times, requesting them to assist in handling and urge the execution of the contract. However, this matter has been delayed until now without being resolved, which has seriously affected the capital turnover of state-owned enterprises and caused losses to state assets. I believe that this irresponsible bureaucratic style of failing to fulfill the contract is a violation of economic discipline. In addition to suggesting that the Xinxiang City Prison Production Section promptly send personnel to the Zhumadian City Trading Branch to pay and pick up the goods, I also hope that the relevant units in Pingyuan Province will examine their own work.

    新乡市监狱生产科  
    违法不履行购麻合同
    编辑同志：平原省新乡市人民政府监狱生产科，不履行在驻马店物资交流大会上和驻马店市贸易支公司签订的购麻合同，严重地影响了国营贸易企业的资金周转。新乡市监狱生产科在去年十月应邀来驻马店参加物资交流大会时，曾向驻马店市贸易支公司订购白秋麻十万斤。双方代表在规格、价格、交货时间、地点、手续等方面取得一致协议后，就到大会贸易处签订贸易合同；合同订明买方须在一九五一年十一月九日到驻马店市贸易支公司交款提货，但直到现在已过期两月，还没有见他们派人来办理。市贸易支公司为这件事曾数次给新乡市人民政府工商局、平原省人民政府商业厅去信，请他们协助处理，督促执行合同。但这件事却拖延到现在没有得到解决，以致严重地影响了国营企业资金的周转，使国家资财受到了损失。我认为这种不履行合同，对工作不负责任的官僚主义作风，是违反经济纪律的行为。我除建议新乡市监狱生产科迅速派员到驻马店市贸易支公司交款提货外，并希望和这件事有关的平原省各机关单位，检查一下自己的工作。  刘山立
