    The Party Inspired Me to Overcome the Bourgeoisie's Corruption
    Dong Wanli
    I came to work at the Northeast Commercial Specialized School in Changchun City in April 1950. At that time, it was the school's construction period, and I was assigned to the management section as a transport worker. Su Zhengjia was our deputy section chief, responsible for all procurement work. We often went out together to buy materials. Soon, I noticed that Su Zhengjia's procurement methods were a bit strange: he would pick up the procurement list from the school and leave, sometimes handing it directly to private merchants without even looking at it, while he himself would go to movies and restaurants with unscrupulous merchants. As time went on, the matter was exposed. It turned out that Su Zhengjia was in collusion with the unscrupulous merchants of "Desheng Hardware Store." Most of the materials he procured were from this store. Whenever the school had construction projects, he would inform the unscrupulous merchants in advance. Sometimes, even before construction started, the merchants would have the materials ready. "Small hardware" was delivered to the school by the truckload, and Su Zhengjia would accept it without even looking at it. Often, the goods were used before the price was even discussed, and he would pay whatever the merchants asked. Another unscrupulous merchant named Li Peilie, who was originally a "junk" dealer, obtained a procurement certificate from the Commercial Specialized School through Su Zhengjia. He went around buying heating pipes, earning over 10 million Northeast currency every day. In this way, he "started from scratch" and opened an iron factory within a few months. Thanks to Su Zhengjia, Li Peilie could freely enter and exit the Commercial Specialized School, and his brother-in-law also got a job at the school.
    At first, they tried to hide their dealings from me. Later, they tried to drag me into it as well. Once, private merchants invited Su Zhengjia to dinner and insisted on taking me along. Sitting there, I thought to myself, I am a revolutionary cadre, how can I eat the wine and food of unscrupulous merchants? The more I thought about it, the more wrong it felt, so I stood up and didn't eat. On the way back to school, I thought: I am a member of the Youth League, and I have just started working, I must not associate with these bad elements. That night, I wrote a written report about this matter to Secretary Ma, and the next day I also told Section Chief Wang of the management section. But afterwards, they did not investigate.
    A few days later, Su Zhengjia found out about this. He asked me to my face why I was "reporting indiscriminately"! He said that having a meal with private merchants was a "method" of work and what mistake was that! Afterwards, I faced more "obstacles" in my work. Those who also had private dealings worked against me, and their words were always meant to beat and satirize me. Car drivers would often unload the goods and drive off, deliberately leaving me behind. I felt that the work was difficult and could not go on like this, so I went to Director Xia of the construction department twice to report the situation to him. He only encouraged me a few words, and the matter was not dealt with.
    During this period, private merchants used various means of seduction on me. Seeing that I had no money, they wanted to lend me money; seeing that my shoes were broken, they wanted to buy me shoes. ... When they saw me, they would say: "What's the use of earning that little money you make in a month? I earn enough in a day for you to earn in a year." Last summer, my family came from Jinzhou to see me and stayed in a hotel. The unscrupulous merchant Li Peilie got the news and ran over, thinking that this was an opportunity. He spoke sweetly, expressing his utmost concern. Before leaving, he repeatedly said: "Don't worry about money, I have already prepared it for you, come to me tomorrow to get it!" I understood his sinister intentions, became even more vigilant, and determined not to fall into his trap. I thought to myself, the Communist Party is honest and serves the people wholeheartedly. I am a revolutionary cadre under the leadership of the Communist Party, and doing things for the people is not just empty talk. Every thing I do must be worthy of the people and worthy of the Party; if I get a little bit dirty, wouldn't that be tantamount to betraying my principles.
    I transferred from the management section to the engineering section, and then to the general affairs section. Su Zhengjia also transferred twice, and was always my section chief. He tried every means to attack me openly and secretly. When it came to salary evaluation, everyone else was raised, but mine was reduced to the lowest amount; at section meetings, he criticized me for not obeying his leadership, looking down on him, and said that I was the "third kind of cadre" that Chairman Gao Gang pointed out. The unscrupulous merchants then came up to threaten me, saying: "Can you fight against them? In any era, the officials have the final say. When you work under someone, can you twist your arm more than your thigh!" At that time, I felt angry, distressed, and helpless. I told the comrades in the Youth League group about this situation, and many comrades supported me in persisting in the struggle; an older cousin in the army (who was a Party member) also often wrote to me, encouraging me not to be discouraged and to fight for the interests of the people, using his own deeds of being wounded and meritorious in the battlefield. At this time, I felt that I was not alone in the struggle, and the Party was the greatest encouragement to me, the Party was my hope. Around September last year, I wrote materials to the leading cadres twice and directly raised objections to Su Zhengjia at the meeting.
    The movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy began, and I was very happy. In order to clarify some facts, I went to the home of the unscrupulous merchant Li Peilie. He was full of enthusiasm and bought a lot of things to entertain me, but I didn't eat them; his two wives also came over, patting me and saying: "This young man is so good, let me introduce you to someone!" These despicable means were simply disgusting!
    When the inspection team came to our school, I told them everything "from the roots." I was greatly encouraged, forgetting my fatigue and hunger, and helped the inspection team to clarify the problem. I personally watched the government arrest the corrupt elements Su Zhengjia and others. The struggle of the past year finally achieved final victory.
    From this, I have a clearer understanding of the Party's glory, correctness, and greatness. As long as we are under the leadership of the Party, always vigilant, and stand firm, no matter how frantically the bourgeoisie attacks, we will surely suppress it. I am determined to study hard, continue to fight against all thieves who steal state property, and better serve the people.

    党鼓舞我战胜了资产阶级的腐蚀
    董万里
    我来到长春市东北商业专门学校工作，是在一九五○年四月。当时，正是建校时期，我被分配到管理科做运输员。苏正家是我们的副科长，负责全部采购工作。我们经常一起出去买材料。过了不久，我就发觉苏正家的采买方法有点奇怪：从校里拿起采买单就走，有时一眼都不看就交给私商，他自己却同奸商去看电影、下馆子。日子长了，事情就露了马脚。原来苏正家和“德盛五金行”的奸商有勾搭，他经手采买的大部分材料，都是这家的。学校里一有修建工程，他老早就送信给奸商。有时不等开工，奸商就把材料准备好了。“小五金”成车往学校送，苏正家看都不看就收下。常常东西用了，价钱还没讲，奸商要多少他就给多少。另一个奸商叫李沛烈，本来是个倒腾“破烂”的，从苏正家手里弄到了商业专门学校的采买证，到处去收买暖气片，每天从中能赚东北币一千多万元。就这样“白手起家”没过几个月，开起一处铁工厂。靠了苏正家，李沛烈可以随便在商业专门学校出出进进，他的小舅子也混进学校里工作。
    他们干的勾当，开初本是避着我的。后来，便想把我也拖下水去。有一回，私商请苏正家吃饭，硬把我拉了去。坐在那里我就想，自己是一个革命干部，怎么能吃奸商的酒饭呢？越想越不对，我就站起来不吃了。回学校时一边走一边想：我是个青年团员，又刚刚参加工作，决不能和这些坏分子同流合污。当晚，我把这回事向马秘书写了书面报告，第二天又跟管理科王科长讲了。但事后他们都没有追查。
    过些天，这事被苏正家知道了。他当面问我为啥“乱汇报”！他说，和私商吃顿饭是工作上的“方式方法”，算得了什么错误！以后，工作上的“小脚”就多了。和他同样有私弊的人都和我作对，他们一说话就是对我敲打、讽刺。开汽车的常常卸了货就把车开跑，故意把我扔下。我觉着工作难做，不能这样下去，便两次去找修建处的夏主任，向他反映情况。他只鼓励我几句，事情也没有得到处理。
    在这段时间里，私商曾对我使用了各种引诱办法。他们看我手中没钱，便要借钱给我；看我脚上的鞋坏了，就要给我买鞋。……见了我就说：“你一个月挣那点钱好干啥，我挣一天够你挣一年的了。”去年夏天，家里人从锦州来看我，住在旅馆里。奸商李沛烈得信就跑了来，他以为这回可是个机会，嘴头上甜言蜜语，表示万分关心。临走还一再说：“用钱不怕，我已经给你准备好了，明天到我那儿去拿吧！”我明白他用心险恶，就更加警惕，决不上他的圈套。我暗自想着，共产党是廉洁奉公为人民服务的，自己是个共产党领导下的革命干部，为人民做事不是一句空话，每做一件事都得对得起人民对得起党；要是沾上一点污秽，那不就等于变了节。
    我从管理科转到工程科，又转到总务科工作。苏正家也同样转了两次，一直是我的科长。他想了各种办法明里暗地打击我。评薪的时候，别人都提高了，单把我的压到最低额；在科内会议上批评我不服从领导，看不起他，说我是高岗主席指出的“第三种干部”。奸商这时又上来威吓我说：“你斗得了人家？啥年头不是当官的说了算，在人家手下工作，胳膊还想拧过大腿！”当时我心里又气愤、又苦闷，也感到没有办法。我把这种情形向团小组的同志们讲了，好多同志支持我坚持斗争；一个在部队上的表哥（他是个党员）也常来信，他用自己在战场上负伤立功的事迹，鼓励我不要灰心，为人民的利益斗争下去。这时我感到自己在斗争中并不是孤立的，党对我是最大的鼓舞，党就是我的希望。去年九月前后，我又两次写材料给领导干部，并在会上直接给苏正家提了意见。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始了，我心里非常高兴。为了弄清一些事实，我到奸商李沛烈家里去了一趟。他满脸殷勤，买了好多东西招待，我不吃；他的两个老婆也凑了上来，一边拍打着我一边说：“这个年轻人多好啊，赶明儿给你介绍个对象吧！”这些卑鄙手段简直令人作呕！
    检查组来到我们学校，我把这些事情“兜根”讲了出来，我受到了莫大的鼓励，忘了乏累、忘了饿，帮助检查组搞清了问题，亲眼看着政府逮捕了贪污分子苏正家等人。一年来的斗争终于获得了最后胜利。
    我从这里更加看清了党的光荣、正确和伟大，我们只要在党的领导下，永远提高警惕，站稳立场，无论资产阶级如何疯狂进攻，我们也一定会把它镇压下去的。我决心努力学习，对一切盗窃国家财产的盗贼继续作斗争，更好地给人民做事。
