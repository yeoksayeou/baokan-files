    Our Great Motherland
    The great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has been signed for two years. Over the past two years, under the protection of the great Sino-Soviet alliance, the Chinese people have been wholeheartedly carrying out the peaceful construction of their great motherland and have waged a just struggle to resist US aggression and aid Korea in order to defend peace and oppose aggression. Over the past two years, conscious Chinese people and revolutionary soldiers have joined the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association one after another. These are the soldiers of the Chinese People's Air Force, who are holding a signing ceremony to join the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
