Summary of Letters to the Editor

Postal Bureaus Should Promptly Respond to Readers' Opinions

Since newspapers are distributed by the post office, readers can easily subscribe due to the more widespread postal network and faster delivery. Therefore, some progress has been made in distribution. However, some postal bureaus are not serious and responsible enough in their newspaper distribution work, leading to numerous reader complaints. According to incomplete statistics, from June to December of last year, 21 opinions were published in various newspapers in Beijing, including issues such as missed deliveries, short deliveries, and late arrivals. Only seven of these received a response in the newspapers. I believe that local postal bureaus, upon seeing these opinions in the newspapers, should not only carefully examine and thoroughly improve their work but also write to the newspaper offices about the inspection results and improvement measures for public response. This would also encourage other postal bureaus to improve their distribution work.

Zhuoxian Brick and Tile Industry Joint Cooperative Fails to Fulfill Contracts

The Zhuoxian Brick and Tile Industry Joint Cooperative in Hebei Province is under the leadership of the Zhuoxian People's Government Construction Section. The Construction Section then entrusted the Zhuoxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative to oversee the Brick and Tile Industry Joint Cooperative and gave the Cooperative the authority to approve the addition of new kilns. Many cadres of the Cooperative have a purely profit-driven mindset. Last year, they expanded from the original 70 kilns to 180. As a result of this blind expansion, the Cooperative experienced tight capital turnover, and production became paralyzed. The Construction Section and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative not only failed to correct this in time but also introduced public business on behalf of the Cooperative, acting as contract guarantors themselves. The Cooperative obtained a large amount of funds but failed to fulfill the contracts. As far as we know, four or five government units have suffered losses due to unqualified products and incomplete deliveries. We believe that the non-fulfillment of contracts should be investigated and corrected.

Scientific and Technological Publications Should Not Use Foreign Languages for Advertising

Since liberation, many commodities that used foreign-language trademarks have switched to using the national language, and advertisements in foreign languages are becoming less common. This is a good phenomenon. However, I have noticed that some recently published scientific and technological publications still have some unnecessary foreign-language advertisements. For example, magazines such as "Mechanical Manufacturing," "Production and Technology," and "Automobiles and Highways" all carried the Chinese and English advertisement of the "Shanghai China Centrifugal Casting Factory." The advertisement for Shanghai Huade Factory in "Electrical World" not only included the factory name and products in English but also used a foreign format to write our national language, writing the factory name and address as "Huade Factory Products, Shanghai, China," which is an unpleasant style.

I believe that writing commercial advertisements in English domestically is completely unnecessary, and I hope that industrialists, businessmen, and publishers will pay attention to correcting this.

Distortion of Policies and Fabrication of Facts Are Not Allowed in News Reports

On October 6th of last year, the "New People and New Deeds" column of the Changjiang Daily published an article by Comrade Zhang Dingtian titled "Great Class Friendship." The theme of this report was that Pi Gaoqian, a worker at the Wuchang Chen Wanxing distillery, showed sympathy for unemployed worker Luo Guocai and voluntarily gave up his job. The author attempted to illustrate the "great class friendship" of the working class through this fact. However, the People's Government led by the working class has already established sound methods to relieve unemployed workers and has helped tens of thousands of workers find employment. Therefore, the individual example of one person being employed at the expense of another's unemployment should not be promoted and praised as a "New Person and New Deed." It should be particularly pointed out that this fact is fabricated. The author, Zhang Dingtian, distorted policies and fabricated facts and should conduct a self-criticism. The Changjiang Daily's publication of an article that distorted policies was also a major oversight.

I Will Definitely Correct My Irresponsible Work Attitude

I am an internist at Fengtai Railway Hospital. After listening to several reports on the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, I have gained a deeper understanding of this movement. In the group meeting, I talked about my act of using my name to obtain medicine for my family, which blurred the lines between public and private interests. I also examined my wasteful behavior. Once, I prescribed deworming medicine to a child without examining his stool; on another occasion, I prescribed penicillin, streptomycin, and sulfonamides to a patient without chemical testing, resulting in a waste of public property and delaying the patient's treatment. In addition, my work attitude was also very poor. When treating patients, regardless of their condition, I always prescribed three days' worth of medicine first. Sometimes I did not pay attention to emergency cases and even refused to allow patients to register. I am determined to resolutely correct these serious irresponsible behaviors.

专栏：来信摘要

    来信摘要
    邮局发行部门应及时答复读者意见
    报纸归邮局发行以后，由于邮政机构设立的比较普遍，寄递迅速，读者便于订阅，所以，在发行方面已有一定成绩。但有些邮局对报纸的发行工作还不够认真负责，因而读者提出了不少意见。根据不完全的统计，从去年六月到十二月，在北京的各报上，就发表过二十一条意见，其中包括漏发、少发、迟到等问题；但在报上答复的只有七件。我认为各地有关邮局看到了报上的意见，除应仔细检查并彻底改进工作外，并应把检查情况、改进办法写给报社，作公开答复。这样也会推动其他邮局改进发行工作。

    涿县砖瓦窑业联营社不履行合同
    河北涿县砖瓦窑业联营社属涿县人民政府修建科领导。修建科又委托涿县供销合作社负责领导这个砖瓦窑业联营社，并把增设新窑的批准权交给窑业联营社。窑业联营社的许多干部有单纯营利观点，在去年把原辖的七十个窑发展到一百八十个。盲目扩展砖瓦窑的结果，就发生了资金周转不灵，生产陷于瘫痪的现象。修建科和供销合作社不但没有及时纠正，反而代为介绍公家生意，自己则充当合同保证人。窑业联营社得到大批资金，却不按合同办事。据我们所知，因成品不合规格、交货不全而受到损失的政府单位，就有四、五个。我们认为，对不履行合同的事情，应检查纠正。

    科学技术刊物不应用外文登广告
    解放以来，很多采用外文商标的商品，已纷纷改用祖国的文字，用外文刊登的广告也不常见了，这是一种很好的现象。但是我看到有些最近出版的科学技术刊物上，还残存着一些不必要的外文广告。例如《机械制造》、《生产与技术》、《汽车和公路》等杂志，都刊登了“上海中国离心机铸厂”的中、英文广告。《电世界》上有一则上海华德工厂的广告，更不只把厂名、产品等项目全部注上英文，而且还用外国的格式来写我们祖国的语文，把厂名、地址写成了“华德工厂出品，上海，中国”这样不顺眼的式样。
    我认为在国内写英文的商业广告是完全没有必要的，希望工商业者和出版者注意纠正。

    在新闻报道中不许歪曲政策和捏造事实
    去年十月六日，长江日报“新人新事”栏发表了张定天同志写的《伟大的阶级友爱》一文。这篇报道的主题是：武昌陈万兴糟坊工人皮高谦，因同情失业工人骆国才，而自动让出自己的工作。作者企图通过这一事实，来说明工人阶级的“伟大的阶级友爱”。但是，工人阶级领导的人民政府，已经定出妥善地救济失业工人的办法，已经帮助了成千成万的工人就业。因而，使一个就业，使另一个又失业的个别例子，当然没有作为“新人新事”加以提倡表扬的必要。特别应该指出的是，这个事实还是虚构捏造的。作者张定天歪曲政策，捏造事实，应作检讨，长江日报发表了歪曲政策的文章，也是一个很大的疏忽。

    我一定纠正我的不负责任的工作态度
    我是丰台铁路医院的内科医师。自从听过几次反贪污，反浪费，反官僚主义的报告之后，我对这个运动有了比较深刻的认识。在小组会上，我谈出了我用自己的名字给家属领药的公私不分的行为。我也检查了我的浪费事实。有一次我给一个小孩看病，没有检查大便，就开了驱虫药；另一次我没有经过化学检验，就给病人开了青霉素，链霉素，磺?等药品，结果浪费了公家的财产，也贻误病人。另外，我的工作态度也是很恶劣的，我给病人看病时，不管病情如何，总是先开三天的药；有时我对急诊也不重视，甚至不准患者挂号。对这种严重的不负责任的行为，我一定坚决纠正。
