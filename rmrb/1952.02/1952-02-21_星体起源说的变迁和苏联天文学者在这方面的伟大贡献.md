    The Evolution of Theories on the Origin of Celestial Bodies and the Great Contributions of Soviet Astronomers in This Regard
    Chen Biao, Assistant Researcher, Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Recently, Soviet astronomers, physicists, geologists, and geophysicists gathered to discuss Academician Schmidt's work on the theory of the origin of the solar system. The meeting affirmed the direction of his work and pointed out areas that needed further research. The newspaper Pravda also published an article by Professor Kukarkin reporting on the meeting.

    Why did Pravda attach so much importance to this meeting?

    This is because a correct theory of the origin of the solar system and the origin of stars (referring to celestial bodies that emit light themselves) is a very important pillar for establishing a materialist worldview. The achievements of Soviet astronomers in this regard are worthy of praise.

    This article describes the evolution of theories on the origin of celestial bodies and the great contributions of Soviet astronomers in this regard.

    (I) Theories on the Origin of Stars

    Normally, the celestial bodies we see at night, apart from a few planets, all have the ability to emit light themselves. These are commonly referred to as stars. The nine major planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) all orbit the sun and are celestial bodies that do not emit light themselves. The reason we can see them is because they reflect sunlight. This section will discuss theories on the origin of stars. The next section will discuss theories on the origin of the solar system.

    Around 1930, people still thought that interstellar space was empty except for the luminous stars. Although it was known that these stars, including the sun, formed the Milky Way galaxy, and that there were many star systems (extragalactic nebulae) with the same structure as the Milky Way in the vast space, it was still impossible to guess how stars were formed. Since matter only exists in the form of stars, or their appendages such as planets, or other luminous objects, it is not easy for us to understand that these stars and luminous objects could exist in other non-luminous states at any moment. That is to say, stars were luminous objects from the beginning and still are today. This view seemed to have a certain theoretical and observational basis because of Hubble's discovery of the redshift of extragalactic nebulae spectra and the work done by de Sitter, Lemaître, and others based on Einstein's general theory of relativity. The evolution of these works reached a point where, sooner or later, precisely 3 to 4 billion years ago, the "entire" universe was in a smaller range than it is now, and its material state was very different from now, with very high temperature and density. Some people, like the British astronomer Milne, even asserted that the universe was created at that time, and called 3 to 4 billion years the age of the universe. This statement is utterly absurd, and now even many astronomers in capitalist countries dare not say so, but instead call 3 to 4 billion years the cosmic time scale, which represents the time required for things in the universe to undergo some detectable changes.

    Why are some inferences of the general theory of relativity, based on such meager observational foundations, so popular and constantly spread in capitalist countries? Just as the dissemination of Jeans' theory of the origin of the solar system, which will be described in the next section, has its social basis. These theories suited the intentions of the bourgeois rulers, disseminated the ultimate unknowability of the universe, and served as a "scientific" basis for the preaching of creationism. Therefore, it was naturally welcomed by the bourgeois rulers, because they relied on religion and idealist philosophy to numb people's minds and facilitate their rule.

    But science will eventually expose these incorrect conclusions. Around 1930, astronomers confirmed from stellar spectra and interstellar extinction that there were a large number of dark, non-luminous substances in the sky besides the luminous stars, mainly in the form of atoms, molecules, and small solid particles. Subsequently, studies of extragalactic nebulae and the dynamics of the Milky Way proved that these substances accounted for half or even more of the total mass in our Milky Way and most other extragalactic nebulae. That is to say, half of the Milky Way and extragalactic nebulae are stars, and the other half are these interstellar substances (or interstellar diffuse matter).

    Due to this discovery, astronomers began to feel that there was an observational basis for establishing a theory of the origin of celestial bodies. But how exactly do luminous stars form from matter diffused in space? In 1941, Whipple established a theory of star formation under the current state of the Milky Way.

    He said that solid particles in interstellar matter, under the influence of the radiation pressure of the radiation field of stars in the current Milky Way, would form stars in about 1 to 2 billion years. Although such a theory cannot explain how the first stars were produced, it at least shows that there is a possible way for stars to be produced now. But it still has shortcomings.

    Soviet astronomers have made many contributions to the study of the properties of interstellar matter. They firmly believe that stars are produced from interstellar matter. But what are their contributions to the theory of the origin of celestial bodies?

    Their great contribution in this regard lies in proving observationally that even now, stars are constantly being produced. This discovery completely shattered the idea that stars and the entire universe were completely produced at once from an unknown mysterious state tens of billions of years ago, and established a strong pillar for the materialist and developmental worldview.

    The fact is that, not long ago, Soviet astronomers Ambartsumian and Markarian, as well as many other astronomical workers, discovered that near some open clusters, there were stars with very similar physical properties, whose existence, according to their luminosity, would not exceed 10 to 20 million years. The spatial motion characteristics of these stars and the clusters near them are completely consistent. That is to say, although they seem to have no relationship with the clusters from the sun inside the Milky Way, they basically have the same origin as the clusters and are an inseparable whole closely related to the clusters. This conclusion has been confirmed by observations of star clusters in extragalactic nebulae. Ambartsumian and others also used the density of the discovered star groups (now named stellar associations) and their position in the Milky Way to calculate the stability of stellar associations under the tidal force of the center of the Milky Way, proving that the mass of the center of our Milky Way is sufficient to completely destroy the organization of stellar associations in a few million to 10 to 20 million years, and transform the current grouped stellar associations into individual stars with no motional correlation. In other words, the time elapsed from the birth of stellar associations to their disintegration is at most 10 to 20 million years. But why can we still see it and discover it now? Does that not just prove that these seen stellar associations were only produced at most 20 million years ago? Since the parent stellar association is like this, the age of its constituent molecules must not exceed 20 million years. According to nuclear physics research, it is now generally known that stars like the sun, according to their current luminosity, can last for at least 1 billion years. 20 million years is too short and insignificant a time for the sun, or even for the earth. In this case, can it not be said that the stars in stellar associations are only produced now? Of course, it should be said so. Due to these works of Soviet astronomers, the Soviet government has allocated funds to set up special instruments to study stellar associations. Many stellar associations have now been discovered, their ages ranging from millions of years to 10 to 20 million years, completely proving the statement that stars are constantly being produced now. The observational and theoretical arguments for this great discovery are so complete and sound that even bourgeois astronomers like Otto Struve cannot help but say that this is a "very significant discovery and a very interesting theory."

    A sound theory must start from practice, and its results must be verified in practice. Due to the discovery of stellar associations, we have already found in practice the law that this theory of the origin of celestial bodies must follow. A correct theory of the origin of celestial bodies that conforms to the materialist viewpoint will surely be born soon. We cannot but thank Soviet astronomers for their achievements in this regard.

    (II) Theories on the Origin of the Solar System

    There has been more discussion about the origin of the solar system in the past, because the problem of the solar system is more personal to human beings on Earth. But its origin involves very many problems, so there was no definite saying about which direction to discuss and study from before.

    The earliest theory on the origin of the solar system was Laplace's nebular hypothesis. This theory believes that the solar system was initially a cloud in space, gradually contracting due to its own gravity, so it rotated faster and faster. When the centrifugal force of a certain rotating part exceeded the centripetal force of the cloud group, it began to throw out matter. These substances then condensed into the nine major planets known today.

    This theory was popular until the early 20th century. At this time, more data on the solar system had been accumulated, so it was found to have a fundamental mechanical contradiction, that is, the sun, which has 99% of the total mass of the solar system, only has 2% of the total angular momentum of the solar system. This is the fatal point of Laplace's nebular hypothesis. Therefore, since the early 20th century, the so-called collision origin theory of Moulton-Chamberlain-Jeans-Jeffreys-Hoyle has been popular.

    This theory believes that the sun initially had no planets. At some point in the past, another star passed by it, and due to the tidal force of this star, a hot gas was sucked out from the surface of the sun. This gas then split and solidified into planets. Such a concept has been gradually modified, basically forming this collision origin theory, that is, attributing the origin of the solar system to an opportunity. Its production is not the inevitable result of internal development, but simply due to the chance of having a collision with another star in the past.

    Of course, if we can prove that in the current state of the Milky Way, the collision of stars is inevitable, then this theory can still be said to have a little practical basis. However, calculations of galactic mechanics have proved that the close passage of two stars occurs on average only once every 10 trillion years in the current state of the Milky Way, and astrophysical calculations have pointed out that the current state of an ordinary star like the sun will never last longer than 10 billion years. That is to say, the chance of the formation of the solar system is unimaginably small. And according to Jeffreys' modification of this theory, it must be a special collision. Therefore, the formation of the solar system can be said to be unique in the universe. That is to say, it seems that human beings must congratulate themselves that they exist so coincidentally in the universe.

    In addition to the above-mentioned strong color of opportunity, such a theory also has many incorrect aspects in physics. The most serious problem is that the hot gas separated from the surface of the sun cannot condense into small celestial bodies like planets. On the contrary, such high-temperature gas will immediately diffuse completely after leaving the main body of the sun, and it is completely impossible to condense. Taking Jupiter as an example, at least the hydrogen gas on it will completely escape into space and will not solidify on Jupiter. However, current observations and theories all point out that there is a large amount of solid hydrogen on Jupiter.

    Even astronomical workers in capitalist countries cannot but feel frustrated by the unsatisfactory nature of these theories.

    In the Soviet Union, at the same time as Jeans proposed his collision theory, Professor Fesenkov had already seen that the origin of the solar system should not be considered solely from a mechanical point of view, but should first study the physical states of the constituent molecules of the solar system, such as planets, comets, and meteors (and meteorites). Understanding from the source of these physical states is more reliable and practical than any other way. On the other hand, Academician Schmidt mentioned above studied the current distribution and movement characteristics of planets in the solar system, and concluded what reasons must inevitably lead to such a regular planetary system as it is now. Professor Fesenkov's research has yielded many valuable results in planetary physics, meteors, meteorites, etc., while Academician Schmidt and his assistants' research has led to a conclusion that the origin of planetary systems can only be started by understanding how interstellar matter condenses into celestial bodies the size of the Earth.

    His conclusions are: (1) Because interstellar matter fills the space, the sun or any other star must have many opportunities to encounter these interstellar substances in their lifetime, so that these substances surround the star or the sun for a considerable period of time. In this way, these interstellar substances around the sun gradually gather near a plane, and under sufficient density, they form more dense groups of matter, and then form planets. In areas slightly closer to the sun, many substances directly fall into the sun, and another part is excluded to farther places due to the light pressure and heat of the sun, so no large planets are formed in the area near the sun, and the density of the formed planets is relatively large. (2) Such an evolutionary result can fully explain many of the laws of motion of planets and satellites in the solar system. Especially because the planets are not separated from the sun, although the sun's mass accounts for 99% of the mass of the entire solar system, the planetary system can account for 98% of the angular momentum of the entire solar system. (3) The planetary construction law formed in this way is basically a cold-to-hot and then cold process, not a unidirectional process of generally hot to cold. Therefore, geological and geophysical research is very necessary.

    The direction pointed out by Academician Schmidt is essentially different from the Western theory of opportunity. Its characteristic lies in the spirit of starting from reality throughout his research direction and thinking method. He does not first fantasize about some reasons and spend a lot of time putting these reasons together into a pattern; instead, he starts from the complex facts of the existing solar system to see how the solar system must have been produced. Such a way of thinking, after detailed mathematical calculations, should and must lead to the conclusion that the existence of the solar system is the inevitable result of the development of things, not any coincidental chance or the product of God's mercy. The fact that other stars have been discovered to have celestial bodies like planets nearby is a very good proof.

    (III) Idealist and Materialist Theories of the Origin of Celestial Bodies

    We often see many disputes between idealism and materialism in science. It has also been mentioned in this introduction. What kind of scientific workers can be regarded as mastering the materialist method? Which kind of theories are materialist and correct? Which kind of theories are idealist and incorrect? Here I can only say what I understand when introducing the theory of the origin of celestial bodies, and I cannot guarantee that I have not misunderstood.

    Can we arbitrarily say that scientific workers in countries ruled by the bourgeoisie are not honestly working, their experimental techniques are not clever, their working methods are not skillful, and they have not obtained any results at all? In this regard, anyone would say no. Many Western scientific workers are working diligently, their experimental techniques and working methods are very clever, and they have also obtained many valuable results and explained many phenomena. These are undeniable, but where are their shortcomings? The shortcomings lie in the way of thinking.

    From the above theory of the origin of celestial bodies, I feel that the main influence of the way of thinking lies in two aspects: one is the view on the problem, and the other is the explanation of the results obtained.

    For example, the origin theory of the solar system inherited from Moulton-Chamberlain-Jeans-Jeffreys-Hoyle has a very subjective starting point, nothing more than the collision of two stars. But in fact, whether the collision of two stars is possible has not been considered. Starting from such a simple and unreliable assumption, some results have been obtained. The reliability of these results can be imagined. In fact, since 1936, criticism of this theory has already begun in Western countries, and it can no longer stand now. Without first analyzing the facts of the solar system, such as the laws of planetary motion, the physical state of planets, and the research of comets and meteors, and using a general way of solving learning problems to make a hypothesis and verify it, is it possible to solve such a complex problem in the essence of nature? It seems that establishing a theory solely based on one's own guesses without starting from reality can be called an idealist viewpoint.

    Secondly, as mentioned in the first section, how did the saying that the universe suddenly appeared tens of billions of years ago around 1930 come about? It did not come from any aspect, but from inappropriately interpreting the results of some accidental data. In addition to obtaining the data of 2 to 3 billion years from Hubble's redshift of extragalactic nebulae spectra, many aspects also obtained data with the same sequence. These are: (1) The source of stellar energy indicates that the average luminous age of stars is about tens of billions of years, (2) The statistics of distant binary stars indicate that the existence of these binary star systems is also tens of billions of years, (3) The mechanical calculations of open clusters prove that under the tidal force of the Milky Way, open clusters will be disintegrated within tens of billions of years and cannot become groups, but can only be individual stars with no mechanical correlation, (4) The equilibrium state of globular clusters must take tens of billions of years to recover if disturbed. (5) The radioactive substances on the earth prove that the earth has existed for at least tens of billions of years. Many Western astronomers believe that the numbers obtained from so many essentially different calculations are all around tens of billions of years, then this tens of billions of years must be a characteristic number in our "universe," and therefore they take it as the age of the universe. In fact, this just shows that the idealist way of thinking often does not look at things from the essence, and is therefore deceived by the superficial "consistency." In fact, the mechanical equilibrium of open clusters and globular clusters cannot be compared with the time sequence of the entire universe at all, and how can the energy radiation of individual stars be compared with the mechanical equilibrium of clusters and the statistics of binary stars? Energy radiation is an internal matter, while the mechanical equilibrium between stars is an external matter! Since we are calculating time, there are many times longer than tens of billions of years (such as the time required for stars near the sun to evenly distribute energy is 10 trillion years), and there are times shorter than it (such as the time for the Milky Way to rotate is 20 million years). Why not calculate them in? This fully proves that tens of billions of years is completely accidental. The reason why some people regard coincidence as so important and do not look at it from the essence is to obtain wrong conclusions.

    Such a starting point and explanation are not satisfactory. The conclusions derived from it are not only inevitably wrong but also harmful. But why is this creation theory of the universe and the origin of the solar system widely spread in Western capitalist countries and societies? As Academician Schmidt once said: "The places where astronomers are not satisfied are precisely the places that religious propagandists are eager to use." It is precisely the statement that the universe was "created" in 3 to 4 billion years, which astronomers oppose, that is used by religious propagandists as "God" "created" the world exactly 3 to 4 billion years ago; it is precisely the unique nature of the solar system collision origin theory, which astronomers are dissatisfied with, that is used by religious propagandists as "scientific" support for propagating "God's" great mercy and compassion in deliberately creating the solar system. In this way, we can clearly see how an idealist way of thinking can cause incorrect views, ultimately leading to the unknowability of the universe and blocking the future of scientific research itself.

    We can also ask, is it that science in capitalist society has never given correct materialist answers? In such a society, science has sometimes continued to play a certain role. Just like the solar system theory, there are currently people like Kuiper and Whipple in the West who are also developing some correct theories, but these theories are not derived from first mastering the materialist way of thinking and consciously leading to them; but are forced out of desperation. Therefore, the research and analysis that Schmidt engaged in 7 or 8 years ago is only now (1949-1951) being done by these people. The society in Western capitalist countries dominates the ideological consciousness of every scientific worker. In the near future, even a large pile of contradictions will not force out any materialist, developmental, and promising scientific direction. Astronomical workers with an idealist way of thinking are unconsciously building spiritual walls for themselves and the entire society with their own hands and brains, and one day they will find that this wall only surrounds themselves.

    The materialist theory of the origin of celestial bodies is just the opposite, starting from the actual complex phenomena, analyzing, researching, and raising it to principles. In its process, it always focuses on verification in practice and is not confused by superficial coincidences. Therefore, it cannot but lead to a changing and developing theory, so that in the field of astronomy, it continues to open up new, bright, and effective research paths, and continues to enrich the foundation of the materialist worldview.

    (IV) The Role of Astrophysics in Establishing a Correct Materialist Worldview

    Undeniably, the above two issues, which are closely related to the materialist worldview, have not yet been finally resolved. For example, the stellar association theory still needs to rely on astrophysics and physics to study and solve how interstellar matter is organized into stars in such a way. The shortcomings and blanks in Schmidt's planet origin theory are even more numerous, such as explaining that the rotation and revolution periods of Mercury are consistent, the rotation period of the moon around the earth is consistent, how the interstellar matter with large rotations is connected to the sun, and the detailed physical steps of the condensation of interstellar matter, etc. All these problems are problems of astrophysics. Only detailed research by all departments of astrophysics and other scientific work can solve these problems. In fact, as Professor Kukarkin said in Pravda, the great progress of astrophysics in the Soviet Union in the past 20 years has made it possible to solve the theory of the origin of celestial bodies. In fact, if you want to ask what the ultimate purpose of constantly analyzing celestial spectra, observing the changes in the intensity of starlight, and constantly applying all physical knowledge to study the possible various celestial structures and movement conditions in astrophysics is, the only answer is to accumulate more materials and establish the rule of materialism in the sky, so that idealists and mystics who can no longer stand on the ground and in the laboratory cannot freely defend themselves by relying on the phenomena in the sky that are not easy to understand. This is the last position that materialism must seize, and astrophysical work is the only weapon to seize this position. Of course, this work is not as easy as experimenting on objects at will in the laboratory (this can be seen from the fact that the laws discovered in the recent 100 years of astronomical history are far fewer than the laws discovered in physics or other sciences), but the belief that we will eventually win is something that every astrophysicist has. The great achievements of Soviet astrophysicists are a very eloquent proof.

    星体起源说的变迁和苏联天文学者在这方面的伟大贡献
    中国科学院  紫金山天文台助理员  陈彪
    最近苏联天文学者，物理学者，地质学者，地球物理学者聚会讨论了斯米特院士在太阳系的产生理论方面所做的工作。会上肯定了他的工作方向，指出了一些需要进一步研究的地方。真理报上并且发表了库卡金教授的报道文章。
    为什么真理报如此重视这一次会议呢？
    这是因为正确的太阳系起源说和恒星（指本身能发光的星体）起源说，是建立唯物的宇宙观的一个非常重要的支柱。苏联天文学者在这方面的成就是值得赞扬的。
    本文所叙述的就是星体起源说的变迁和苏联天文学者在这方面的伟大贡献。
    （一）恒星起源学说
    平常我们晚上看到的星体，除了几个行星以外，都是自己有发光能力的。这些习惯上被称为恒星。九大行星（水星、金星、地球、火星、木星、土星、天王星、海王星、冥王星）都是围绕着太阳运行的，自己不发光的天体。我们之所以能够看到它们，是因为它们反射了太阳光的缘故。这一节我们要谈一下恒星起源学说。下一节将谈一下太阳系起源学说。
    一九三零年左右，人们还以为除了发光的恒星以外，星际空间是空的。虽然知道了这些恒星连太阳在内组织成了银河系，而广大的空间中又还有许许多多的和银河系构造一样的恒星系统（河外星云），但是却始终无法猜测恒星是如何生成的。既然物质只有以恒星，或它的附属物如行星，或其他发光物体的形态而存在，我们就不太容易理解这些恒星和发光物体在任何时刻会以其他不发光的状态存在。这就是说，恒星自始就是发光的物体，一直到现在。这一种说法又因为赫勃尔发现河外星云谱线红移以及德塞特、勒每特等人根据爱因斯坦的普遍相对论的推论所作的工作似乎变得更有了一定的理论和观测的基础了。这些工作的演变，达到了这样一种地步，就是说不迟不早，恰恰在距今三十亿到四十亿年前，“整个”宇宙是处在一个远比现在为小的范围内，它的物质状态也和现在非常不同，温度和密度都非常高。甚至于有人，如同英国的天文学者米尔恩就肯定地说宇宙就是在那时被创造出来的，而把三十亿年或四十亿年称为宇宙的年龄。这一种说法真是荒谬透顶，现在甚至在资本主义国家里许多天文学者都不敢如此说，而改称三十亿年或四十亿年为宇宙的时度，是代表宇宙中的事物经历一些可探测的变化所需要的时间。
    建立在如此微薄的观测基础上的一些普遍相对论的推论为什么会如此地脍炙人口，不断在资本主义国家里传扬、散布呢？正如下节所将叙述的秦斯的太阳系起源说的散布一样，是有它的社会基础的。这些学说适合了资产阶级统治者的意图，传播了宇宙的最终不可知论，作了上帝创世论者宣教的“科学”基础。因此，当然为资产阶级的统治者所欢迎，因为他们正是借重了宗教和唯心的哲学来麻醉人心，便利他们的统治的。
    但是科学终于要拆穿这些不正确的结论的。就在一九三○年左右，天文学者从恒星光谱，星际吸光肯定地证实了天空中除了发光的恒星以外，还有大量的暗黑即不发光的物质存在，它们主要的是以原子、分子和小固体质点紧接着，对于河外星云，银河系力学的研究证明了这些物质在我们的银河系和其他多数的河外星云中占了总质量的半数，甚至于还要多。就是说，银河系和河外星云中一半是恒星，一半就是这些星际物质（或称为星际弥漫物质）。
    由于这一发现，天文学者们都开始感觉到建立星体起源说是有了观测的基础了。但是究竟如何由弥漫在空间的物质聚集而成发光的恒星呢？一九四一年惠普曾经建立起一个在现在的银河系状态下恒星形成的理论。
    他说星际物质中的固体质点，受了现在银河系中恒星的辐射场的辐射压力的影响，会在十亿到二十亿年左右形成恒星。这样的一个理论，虽然还不能说明最初的恒星是如何产生的，至少说明了现在恒星是有了一个可能产生的途径。但是它还有缺点。
    对于星际物质的性质的研究，苏联天文学者是有许多贡献的。他们肯定地相信星是由星际物质产生的。但他们对于星体起源说的贡献在什么方面呢？
    他们在这方面的伟大贡献在于从观测上证明就在现在，恒星还是不断地产生出来。这一发现，彻底打破了那些以为恒星和整个宇宙是在几十亿年前由未知神秘的状态一下就完全产生出来的说法，给唯物的、发展的宇宙观建立了一个坚强的支柱。
    事实是这样，不久以前苏联的天文学者阿姆巴楚米扬和马卡兰以及许多其他的天文工作者发现了在一些疏散星团附近有物理性质很相近的，按照其发光能力可以说它们的存在到现在为止是不会超过一、两千万年的恒星。这些恒星和在它们附近的星团在空间的运动特性是完全一致的。这就是说，虽然由银河系内部的太阳上看来外表上它们和星团之间似乎没有关系，但是它们和星团基本上是有同一来源的，是和星团密切连系而不可分的一个整体。这一论断已经由观测河外星云上的星团证实了。阿姆巴楚米扬等又根据上述所发现的星的集团（现已定名为星协）的密度和它们在银河系中的位置来推算星协在银河系中心的潮汐力作用下的稳定度，证明了我们银河系的中心质量足以使星协的组织在几百万年到一、两千万年之间完全摧毁，而使现在所见到的成集团的星协变为一颗颗毫无运动关联的个别的恒星。换句话说，星协自出生到被瓦解为止所经过的时间最多不过一、两千万年。但是为什么我们在现在还能看见它，发现它呢？那不就恰恰证明了这些所见到的星协是仅仅在至多不过两千万年前才产生出来的吗？作为母体的星协既然如此，其中的组成分子的年龄一定不会超过两千万年的。根据原子核物理的研究，现在一般都知道如太阳这类的星，按照它现在的发光率来讲，至少还可以维持十亿年以上。两千万年对于太阳而言，甚至于对地球而言都是太短的一个不足道的时间。这样说来，难道不可以说，星协里的星是现在才产生出来的吗？当然应该如此说。由于苏联天文学者的这些工作，苏联政府曾经拨款设置专门的仪器来作星协的研究。现在已经发现了许许多多的星协，它们的年龄由数百万年到一、两千万年，完全证明了恒星在现在正在不断地产生出来的这一种说法。这一伟大的发现，其观测和理论的论据是如此之完满和健全，甚至于资产阶级的天文学者如奥多·斯屈鲁维也不能不说这是一个“很有意义的发现和很有趣的理论。”
    作为一个健全的理论必须要由实际出发，它的结果要能在实际中得到验证。由于星协的发现，我们已经在实际中找出了这一星体起源论所必将遵循的规律。一个正确的符合唯物论观点的星体起源论一定不久就要诞生。我们不能不感谢苏联天文学者在这方面的成就。
    （二）太阳系起源说
    太阳系起源的讨论在过去是比较多的，因为太阳系的问题对于在地球上的人类而言，是比较切身的。但是它的起源所牵涉到的问题却非常多，所以究竟应该从那一个方向去讨论、钻研，在以前都还没有肯定的说法。
    最早的太阳系起源说是拉普拉斯的星云说。这一说法认为太阳系最初是在空间的一团云雾，由它自己的引力逐渐收缩，因此就愈转愈快，发展到某一转动部分的离心力胜过云雾集团的向心引力时，就开始抛出物质。这些物质就凝聚成为现在所知的九大行星。
    这一理论流行到二十世纪初年。这时对于太阳系的数据已经积累得更多，因此发现了它有基本上的力学上的矛盾，就是具有太阳系全质量百分之九十九的太阳却只具有全太阳系的角动量的百分之二。这是拉普拉斯星云说的致命点。因此在二十世纪初年到现在就一直流行着所谓慕尔敦—张伯伦—秦斯—吉弗利斯—豪依尔的所谓碰撞起源说。
    这一种学说认为太阳最初是没有行星的。在过去的某一个时候，在它近旁掠过了另一个恒星，由于这一恒星的潮汐力，就从太阳表面上吸出了一条炽热气体。这一条气体就分裂凝固而成了行星。像这样的一种观念逐步修改，基本上形成了这一碰撞起源说，即是把太阳系的产生归之于一个机遇，它之所以能产生，并不是内部发展的必然结果，而是单纯的由于过去曾经有过一个一次和另一个恒星碰撞的机会的缘故。
    当然，假若我们能够证明，在现在银河系的状态下，这种恒星和恒星的碰撞是必然不可避免的，那么这一理论就还可以说是有一点实际基础。但是星系力学的计算，证明了在现在银河系的状态下两个恒星的靠近掠过平均要十万亿年才发生一次，而天体物理的计算都指出了一个如太阳这种普通的恒星的现状绝不会维持一百亿年之久的。这就是说太阳系的产生的机会是小到不可以想像了。而在这一学说按照吉弗利斯的修改，还必须是一种特殊的碰撞。因此太阳系的产生在宇宙间可以说是绝无仅有的了。这就是说，似乎人类必须庆贺自己，竟然会如此凑巧地在宇宙中存在。
    这样一种理论除了上述的浓厚的机遇色彩以外，在物理上也有许多不对的地方。其中最严重的问题在于由太阳表面上分出去的炽热气体不能凝聚成小的如同行星之类的天体。正相反，如此高温的气体在脱离了太阳本体之后会立即扩散净尽，完全不可能凝聚的。就如木星而言，至少它上面的氢气是要完全逃逸入空间不会凝固在木星上面。而现在的观测和理论都指出木星上面有大量固体氢存在。
    这些理论之不能使人满意的情形，连资本主义国家内的天文工作者都不能不觉得丧气。
    在苏联，在和秦斯提出他的碰撞学说的同时，费森柯夫教授就已经看出太阳系起源不应该仅仅从力学的观点出发，而应该首先研究组成太阳系的各组成分子，如行星、彗星、流星（和陨石）的物理状态。从产生这些物理状态的根源来了解，是比任何其他方式可靠些、实际些。另一方面，上述的斯米特院士就从太阳系现在的行星分配状况、运动特点来研究，是那一些原因必然导致如现在这样有规律的行星系统。费森柯夫教授的研究得到了许多行星物理、流星、陨石等有价值的结果，而斯米特院士和他的助手的研究就产生了一个结论，就是行星系的产生只有从了解星际物质如何凝聚成为有如地球大小的天体这一方面来着手。
    他的结论是：（一）由于星际物质充塞了空间，太阳或任何其他恒星在它们的一生中必定有许多机会遇着这些星际物质而使得这些物质在相当长的时期内围绕着恒星，或太阳。这样这些在太阳周围的星际物质在其演化过程中就逐渐聚集在一个平面附近，而在充分的密度下就形成了更密集的物质集团，再后形成行星。在略为靠近太阳的区域，有很多物质直接陷入了太阳，另一部分由于太阳的光压和热力而被排除到较远的地方，因此在近太阳的区域就没有大行星形成，所形成的行星的密度也比较大。（二）像这样的演化结果可以充分解释许许多多太阳系内行星和卫星的运行规律。尤其因为行星不是由太阳分出来的，所以尽管太阳的质量占了全太阳系的质量的百分之九十九，但是行星系统却可以占有整个太阳系百分之九十八的角动量。（三）由这样形成的行星系，其中的行星构造定律基本上是冷变热而后再行变冷的步骤，不是一般由热变冷的单向步骤。因此地质上，地球物理上的研究是非常必要的。
    斯米特院士所指出的方向是和西方的机遇说有本质上的不同。其特点在于他的研究方向和思想方法中贯穿了从实际出发的精神。他并不首先幻想一些原因，花下许多时间来把这些原因凑成一付图案；而是从现有的太阳系的复杂的事实出发，看一看究竟怎样才会必然地产生了太阳系。这样一种思想方法，经过详细的数学计算是应该而且必然导致结论，即太阳系的存在是事物发展的必然结果，不是任何机缘凑巧，或是上帝慈悲的产物。现在已经发现了其他恒星近旁也有像行星一类的天体存在就是很好的证明。
    （三）唯心的和唯物的星体起源论
    我们时常见到在科学方面有许多唯心和唯物之争。在这篇介绍中也提到过。究竟什么样的科学工作者才算是掌握了唯物的方法的呢：那一类的理论又是唯物的，正确的；那一类理论又是唯心的，不正确的呢？我在这里只能把我自己在介绍星体起源论时所了解的说一下，并不能保证我一定没有看错。
    难道我们可以武断地说，在资产阶级所统治的国家里的科学工作者都不是老老实实在作工作，他们的实验技术不高明，他们的工作方法不巧妙，他们并没有得到一点点结果吗？在这方面任何人都会说，不是这样。许多西方的科学工作者是在勤恳工作，他们的实验技术，工作方法都很高明，他们也得到许多的有价值的结果，说明了许多现象。这些都是不可否认的，但是他们的缺陷在那里呢？缺陷在于思想方法。
    从上述的星体起源论来看，我觉得思想方法的主要影响在两方面，一是对于问题的看法，另一是对于所得结果的解释。
    如慕尔敦—张伯伦—秦斯—吉弗利斯—豪依尔等
    一脉相传的太阳系起源说的出发点是非常主观的，不外乎两个星的碰撞。但是实际上两星碰撞是否可能却并没有考虑到。仅仅从这样一个简单的不可靠的假设出发，得到了一些结果。这些结果中的可靠性也就可想而知了。事实上在一九三六年以后，在西方国家内早已展开了对这一理论的批判，到现在它已站不住了。不先从分析太阳系的事实，如行星运动的规律，行星的物理状态，彗星、流星的研究出发，而笼统地用演算学习题的方式，来一个假设、求证，要想解决自然界本质上如此复杂的问题，是可能的吗？像这样专凭一己心中的猜想不从实际出发来建立理论似乎可以称为唯心的观点吧。
    其次，如在第一节所述，在一九三○年左右，宇宙在数十亿年以前突然产生的说法是怎样来的呢？并不是从任何方面，而是不恰当地解释了某些偶合的数据的结果。除了由赫勃尔的河外星云谱线红移得到了二、三十亿年的数据以外，还有许多方面也得到数序相同的数据。这些就是：（一）星能的来源说明平均星的发光年龄大约数十亿年，（二）远距双星的统计说明这些双星系的存在也有数十亿年，（三）对于疏散星团的力学计算，证明在银河系的潮汐力下，疏散星团在数十亿年之内就会被拆散，不能成为集团，只能是一颗颗的无力学关联的星了，（四）球状星团的平衡状态若被扰乱，则必须数十亿年的时间才能恢复。（五）地球放射物质证明地球至少存在有数十亿年之久。西方许多天文学家都以为这样许多本质不同的计算所得的数字都在数十亿年左右，那末这一数十亿年必定是我们
    “宇宙”中间的一个特性数字，因此才以之为宇宙的年龄。其实这正恰恰说明了唯心的思想方法往往不从事物的本质上来看，因而被表面上的“一致”迷惑住了。实际上疏散星团和球状星团的力学上的平衡是完全不能和整个宇宙的时序相提并论的，而个别恒星的能量放射又怎么能同星团的力学平衡，双星的统计相提并论呢？能量放射是内部的事而星和星间的力学平衡是外部的事！既然计算时间，那有许多比数十亿年长的时间（如太阳附近恒星均分能量所需的时间就是十万亿年），又有比它短的时间（如银河系回转的时间为两千万年）如何不计算进去呢？这充分证明了数十亿年完全是偶合。有人所以把偶合看成如此重要而不从本质上去看，那是要得到错误的结论的。
    像这样的出发点和解释是不能令人满意的。由之而来的结论不但必然错误而且有害。但是为什么这种宇宙创始论，太阳系起源说会在西方资本主义国家、社会中广泛流传呢？正如斯米特院士曾经说过：“天文学家所不能满意的地方正是宗教宣传家所极欲利用的地方。”正是天文学者所反对的“宇宙恰恰会在三、四十亿年‘创造’出来”的说法给宗教宣传者利用为“恰恰在三、四十亿年以前‘上帝’‘创造’了世界”；正是天文学家所不满意的太阳系碰撞起源说的绝无仅有的性质，给宗教宣传家作为宣传“上帝”大慈大悲故意创造了太阳系的“科学”的支持。这样我们可以明显地看出来，唯心的思想方法会引起如何的不正确的看法，最终导致宇宙的不可知论而阻塞了科学研究本身的前途。
    我们还可以问，是不是在资本主义社会中，科学就永远没有给过正确的唯物的答案吗？在那样的社会中科学曾经也还有时继续起过一定的作用。正如太阳系理论一样，在现在西方有古柏、惠普等人也在发展一部分正确的理论，但是他们这些理论并不是先掌握了唯物的思想方法，自觉地导致出来的；而是走头无路逼出来的。所以斯米特在七、八年前就从事的研究分析仅仅在最近（一九四九——一九五一）才由这些人在做。西方资本主义国家中的社会支配着每一个科学工作者的思想意识，在不久的将来，就是一大堆矛盾也逼不出任何唯物的、发展的、有前途的科学方向了。具有唯心的思想方法的天文工作者正在不自觉地用自己的手和脑建筑自己和整个社会的心灵上的围墙，终有一天将发现这围墙只围住了他自己。
    而唯物的星体起源说恰恰与之相反，由实际的复杂现象出发、分析、研究，提高到原则。在它的过程中随时着眼于在实际中的验证，不被表面的偶合所迷惑。因此它就不能不导致一个变化的、发展的学说，使得在天文的领域内继续不断地开辟着新的、光明的、有效的研究途径，继续不断地丰富着唯物宇宙观的基础。
    （四）天体物理学在建立正确的唯物宇宙观方面所起的作用
    无可讳言，上述两个和唯物宇宙观有极大关联的问题还没有得到最后的解决。如星协理论还要依靠天体物理学和物理学来研究解决究竟星际物质以那样一种方式组织成星的。而斯米特的行星起源说的缺陷和空白更多一些，如解释水星自转和公转周期一致，月亮绕地球和自转周期一致，具有大转动的星际物质以何种方式和太阳联系，星际物质凝聚的详细物理步骤等等一切。所有这些问题都是天体物理学的问题。只有经由天体物理学和其他方面的科学工作的各部门的详细研究才能解决这些问题，事实上，正如库卡金教授在真理报上所说，二十年来天体物理学在苏联的巨大进展使得解决星体起源说有了可能。事实上假若要问究竟从事天体物理工作的经常不断地分析天体光谱，观测星光强弱变化和不断地在理论上应用所有的物理知识研究可能的各种各样的天体构造，运动状况的终极目的为何，那唯一的答案是累积更多的材料在天空中建立起唯物论的统治，使得在地面上，实验室中已无法立足的唯心论者，神秘论者也不能依靠不太容易了解的天空中的现象自由自在地为他们辩护。这是唯物论必须夺取的一个最后阵地，天体物理工作就是唯一的夺取这一阵地的武器。当然这一工作并不如在实验室中可以把对象任意作实验那样容易（这可以由在天文学历史的近一百年中所发现的规律远比物理学或其他科学所发现的规律为少这一点看出），但是最终必将胜利的信念却是每一个天体物理工作者都有的。苏联天体物理学者的伟大成就就是很雄辩的证明。
