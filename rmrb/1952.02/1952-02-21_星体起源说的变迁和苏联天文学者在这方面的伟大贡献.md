    The Evolution of Theories on the Origin of Celestial Bodies and the Great Contributions of Soviet Astronomers in This Regard
    Chen Biao, Assistant Researcher, Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Recently, Soviet astronomers, physicists, geologists, and geophysicists gathered to discuss Academician Schmidt's work on the theory of the origin of the solar system. The meeting affirmed the direction of his work and pointed out areas that needed further research. The newspaper Pravda also published an article by Professor Kukarkin reporting on the meeting.

    Why did Pravda attach so much importance to this meeting?

    This is because a correct theory of the origin of the solar system and the origin of stars (referring to celestial bodies that emit light themselves) is a very important pillar for establishing a materialist worldview. The achievements of Soviet astronomers in this regard are worthy of praise.

    This article describes the evolution of theories on the origin of celestial bodies and the great contributions of Soviet astronomers in this regard.

    (I) Theories on the Origin of Stars

    Normally, the celestial bodies we see at night, apart from a few planets, all have the ability to emit light themselves. These are commonly referred to as stars. The nine major planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto) all orbit the sun and are celestial bodies that do not emit light themselves. The reason we can see them is because they reflect sunlight. This section will discuss theories on the origin of stars. The next section will discuss theories on the origin of the solar system.

    Around 1930, people still thought that interstellar space was empty except for the luminous stars. Although it was known that these stars, including the sun, formed the Milky Way galaxy, and that there were many star systems (extragalactic nebulae) with the same structure as the Milky Way in the vast space, it was still impossible to guess how stars were formed. Since matter only exists in the form of stars, or their appendages such as planets, or other luminous objects, it is not easy for us to understand that these stars and luminous objects could exist in other non-luminous states at any moment. That is to say, stars were luminous objects from the beginning and still are today. This view seemed to have a certain theoretical and observational basis because of Hubble's discovery of the redshift of extragalactic nebulae spectra and the work done by de Sitter, Lema√Ætre, and others based on Einstein's general theory of relativity. The evolution of these works reached a point where, sooner or later, precisely 3 to 4 billion years ago, the "entire" universe was in a smaller range than it is now, and its material state was very different from now, with very high temperature and density. Some people, like the British astronomer Milne, even asserted that the universe was created at that time, and called 3 to 4 billion years the age of the universe. This statement is utterly absurd, and now even many astronomers in capitalist countries dare not say so, but instead call 3 to 4 billion years the cosmic time scale, which represents the time required for things in the universe to undergo some detectable changes.

    Why are some inferences of the general theory of relativity, based on such meager observational foundations, so popular and constantly spread in capitalist countries? Just as the dissemination of Jeans' theory of the origin of the solar system, which will be described in the next section, has its social basis. These theories suited the intentions of the bourgeois rulers, disseminated the ultimate unknowability of the universe, and served as a "scientific" basis for the preaching of creationism. Therefore, it was naturally welcomed by the bourgeois rulers, because they relied on religion and idealist philosophy to numb people's minds and facilitate their rule.

    But science will eventually expose these incorrect conclusions. Around 1930, astronomers confirmed from stellar spectra and interstellar extinction that there were a large number of dark, non-luminous substances in the sky besides the luminous stars, mainly in the form of atoms, molecules, and small solid particles. Subsequently, studies of extragalactic nebulae and the dynamics of the Milky Way proved that these substances accounted for half or even more of the total mass in our Milky Way and most other extragalactic nebulae. That is to say, half of the Milky Way and extragalactic nebulae are stars, and the other half are these interstellar substances (or interstellar diffuse matter).

    Due to this discovery, astronomers began to feel that there was an observational basis for establishing a theory of the origin of celestial bodies. But how exactly do luminous stars form from matter diffused in space? In 1941, Whipple established a theory of star formation under the current state of the Milky Way.

    He said that solid particles in interstellar matter, under the influence of the radiation pressure of the radiation field of stars in the current Milky Way, would form stars in about 1 to 2 billion years. Although such a theory cannot explain how the first stars were produced, it at least shows that there is a possible way for stars to be produced now. But it still has shortcomings.

    Soviet astronomers have made many contributions to the study of the properties of interstellar matter. They firmly believe that stars are produced from interstellar matter. But what are their contributions to the theory of the origin of celestial bodies?

    Their great contribution in this regard lies in proving observationally that even now, stars are constantly being produced. This discovery completely shattered the idea that stars and the entire universe were completely produced at once from an unknown mysterious state tens of billions of years ago, and established a strong pillar for the materialist and developmental worldview.

    The fact is that, not long ago, Soviet astronomers Ambartsumian and Markarian, as well as many other astronomical workers, discovered that near some open clusters, there were stars with very similar physical properties, whose existence, according to their luminosity, would not exceed 10 to 20 million years. The spatial motion characteristics of these stars and the clusters near them are completely consistent. That is to say, although they seem to have no relationship with the clusters from the sun inside the Milky Way, they basically have the same origin as the clusters and are an inseparable whole closely related to the clusters. This conclusion has been confirmed by observations of star clusters in extragalactic nebulae. Ambartsumian and others also used the density of the discovered star groups (now named stellar associations) and their position in the Milky Way to calculate the stability of stellar associations under the tidal force of the center of the Milky Way, proving that the mass of the center of our Milky Way is sufficient to completely destroy the organization of stellar associations in a few million to 10 to 20 million years, and transform the current grouped stellar associations into individual stars with no motional correlation. In other words, the time elapsed from the birth of stellar associations to their disintegration is at most 10 to 20 million years. But why can we still see it and discover it now? Does that not just prove that these seen stellar associations were only produced at most 20 million years ago? Since the parent stellar association is like this, the age of its constituent molecules must not exceed 20 million years. According to nuclear physics research, it is now generally known that stars like the sun, according to their current luminosity, can last for at least 1 billion years. 20 million years is too short and insignificant a time for the sun, or even for the earth. In this case, can it not be said that the stars in stellar associations are only produced now? Of course, it should be said so. Due to these works of Soviet astronomers, the Soviet government has allocated funds to set up special instruments to study stellar associations. Many stellar associations have now been discovered, their ages ranging from millions of years to 10 to 20 million years, completely proving the statement that stars are constantly being produced now. The observational and theoretical arguments for this great discovery are so complete and sound that even bourgeois astronomers like Otto Struve cannot help but say that this is a "very significant discovery and a very interesting theory."

    A sound theory must start from practice, and its results must be verified in practice. Due to the discovery of stellar associations, we have already found in practice the law that this theory of the origin of celestial bodies must follow. A correct theory of the origin of celestial bodies that conforms to the materialist viewpoint will surely be born soon. We cannot but thank Soviet astronomers for their achievements in this regard.

    (II) Theories on the Origin of the Solar System

    There has been more discussion about the origin of the solar system in the past, because the problem of the solar system is more personal to human beings on Earth. But its origin involves very many problems, so there was no definite saying about which direction to discuss and study from before.

    The earliest theory on the origin of the solar system was Laplace's nebular hypothesis. This theory believes that the solar system was initially a cloud in space, gradually contracting due to its own gravity, so it rotated faster and faster. When the centrifugal force of a certain rotating part exceeded the centripetal force of the cloud group, it began to throw out matter. These substances then condensed into the nine major planets known today.

    This theory was popular until the early 20th century. At this time, more data on the solar system had been accumulated, so it was found to have a fundamental mechanical contradiction, that is, the sun, which has 99% of the total mass of the solar system, only has 2% of the total angular momentum of the solar system. This is the fatal point of Laplace's nebular hypothesis. Therefore, since the early 20th century, the so-called collision origin theory of Moulton-Chamberlain-Jeans-Jeffreys-Hoyle has been popular.

    This theory believes that the sun initially had no planets. At some point in the past, another star passed by it, and due to the tidal force of this star, a hot gas was sucked out from the surface of the sun. This gas then split and solidified into planets. Such a concept has been gradually modified, basically forming this collision origin theory, that is, attributing the origin of the solar system to an opportunity. Its production is not the inevitable result of internal development, but simply due to the chance of having a collision with another star in the past.

    Of course, if we can prove that in the current state of the Milky Way, the collision of stars is inevitable, then this theory can still be said to have a little practical basis. However, calculations of galactic mechanics have proved that the close passage of two stars occurs on average only once every 10 trillion years in the current state of the Milky Way, and astrophysical calculations have pointed out that the current state of an ordinary star like the sun will never last longer than 10 billion years. That is to say, the chance of the formation of the solar system is unimaginably small. And according to Jeffreys' modification of this theory, it must be a special collision. Therefore, the formation of the solar system can be said to be unique in the universe. That is to say, it seems that human beings must congratulate themselves that they exist so coincidentally in the universe.

    In addition to the above-mentioned strong color of opportunity, such a theory also has many incorrect aspects in physics. The most serious problem is that the hot gas separated from the surface of the sun cannot condense into small celestial bodies like planets. On the contrary, such high-temperature gas will immediately diffuse completely after leaving the main body of the sun, and it is completely impossible to condense. Taking Jupiter as an example, at least the hydrogen gas on it will completely escape into space and will not solidify on Jupiter. However, current observations and theories all point out that there is a large amount of solid hydrogen on Jupiter.

    Even astronomical workers in capitalist countries cannot but feel frustrated by the unsatisfactory nature of these theories.

    In the Soviet Union, at the same time as Jeans proposed his collision theory, Professor Fesenkov had already seen that the origin of the solar system should not be considered solely from a mechanical point of view, but should first study the physical states of the constituent molecules of the solar system, such as planets, comets, and meteors (and meteorites). Understanding from the source of these physical states is more reliable and practical than any other way. On the other hand, Academician Schmidt mentioned above studied the current distribution and movement characteristics of planets in the solar system, and concluded what reasons must inevitably lead to such a regular planetary system as it is now. Professor Fesenkov's research has yielded many valuable results in planetary physics, meteors, meteorites, etc., while Academician Schmidt and his assistants' research has led to a conclusion that the origin of planetary systems can only be started by understanding how interstellar matter condenses into celestial bodies the size of the Earth.

    His conclusions are: (1) Because interstellar matter fills the space, the sun or any other star must have many opportunities to encounter these interstellar substances in their lifetime, so that these substances surround the star or the sun for a considerable period of time. In this way, these interstellar substances around the sun gradually gather near a plane, and under sufficient density, they form more dense groups of matter, and then form planets. In areas slightly closer to the sun, many substances directly fall into the sun, and another part is excluded to farther places due to the light pressure and heat of the sun, so no large planets are formed in the area near the sun, and the density of the formed planets is relatively large. (2) Such an evolutionary result can fully explain many of the laws of motion of planets and satellites in the solar system. Especially because the planets are not separated from the sun, although the sun's mass accounts for 99% of the mass of the entire solar system, the planetary system can account for 98% of the angular momentum of the entire solar system. (3) The planetary construction law formed in this way is basically a cold-to-hot and then cold process, not a unidirectional process of generally hot to cold. Therefore, geological and geophysical research is very necessary.

    The direction pointed out by Academician Schmidt is essentially different from the Western theory of opportunity. Its characteristic lies in the spirit of starting from reality throughout his research direction and thinking method. He does not first fantasize about some reasons and spend a lot of time putting these reasons together into a pattern; instead, he starts from the complex facts of the existing solar system to see how the solar system must have been produced. Such a way of thinking, after detailed mathematical calculations, should and must lead to the conclusion that the existence of the solar system is the inevitable result of the development of things, not any coincidental chance or the product of God's mercy. The fact that other stars have been discovered to have celestial bodies like planets nearby is a very good proof.

    (III) Idealist and Materialist Theories of the Origin of Celestial Bodies

    We often see many disputes between idealism and materialism in science. It has also been mentioned in this introduction. What kind of scientific workers can be regarded as mastering the materialist method? Which kind of theories are materialist and correct? Which kind of theories are idealist and incorrect? Here I can only say what I understand when introducing the theory of the origin of celestial bodies, and I cannot guarantee that I have not misunderstood.

    Can we arbitrarily say that scientific workers in countries ruled by the bourgeoisie are not honestly working, their experimental techniques are not clever, their working methods are not skillful, and they have not obtained any results at all? In this regard, anyone would say no. Many Western scientific workers are working diligently, their experimental techniques and working methods are very clever, and they have also obtained many valuable results and explained many phenomena. These are undeniable, but where are their shortcomings? The shortcomings lie in the way of thinking.

    From the above theory of the origin of celestial bodies, I feel that the main influence of the way of thinking lies in two aspects: one is the view on the problem, and the other is the explanation of the results obtained.

    For example, the origin theory of the solar system inherited from Moulton-Chamberlain-Jeans-Jeffreys-Hoyle has a very subjective starting point, nothing more than the collision of two stars. But in fact, whether the collision of two stars is possible has not been considered. Starting from such a simple and unreliable assumption, some results have been obtained. The reliability of these results can be imagined. In fact, since 1936, criticism of this theory has already begun in Western countries, and it can no longer stand now. Without first analyzing the facts of the solar system, such as the laws of planetary motion, the physical state of planets, and the research of comets and meteors, and using a general way of solving learning problems to make a hypothesis and verify it, is it possible to solve such a complex problem in the essence of nature? It seems that establishing a theory solely based on one's own guesses without starting from reality can be called an idealist viewpoint.

    Secondly, as mentioned in the first section, how did the saying that the universe suddenly appeared tens of billions of years ago around 1930 come about? It did not come from any aspect, but from inappropriately interpreting the results of some accidental data. In addition to obtaining the data of 2 to 3 billion years from Hubble's redshift of extragalactic nebulae spectra, many aspects also obtained data with the same sequence. These are: (1) The source of stellar energy indicates that the average luminous age of stars is about tens of billions of years, (2) The statistics of distant binary stars indicate that the existence of these binary star systems is also tens of billions of years, (3) The mechanical calculations of open clusters prove that under the tidal force of the Milky Way, open clusters will be disintegrated within tens of billions of years and cannot become groups, but can only be individual stars with no mechanical correlation, (4) The equilibrium state of globular clusters must take tens of billions of years to recover if disturbed. (5) The radioactive substances on the earth prove that the earth has existed for at least tens of billions of years. Many Western astronomers believe that the numbers obtained from so many essentially different calculations are all around tens of billions of years, then this tens of billions of years must be a characteristic number in our "universe," and therefore they take it as the age of the universe. In fact, this just shows that the idealist way of thinking often does not look at things from the essence, and is therefore deceived by the superficial "consistency." In fact, the mechanical equilibrium of open clusters and globular clusters cannot be compared with the time sequence of the entire universe at all, and how can the energy radiation of individual stars be compared with the mechanical equilibrium of clusters and the statistics of binary stars? Energy radiation is an internal matter, while the mechanical equilibrium between stars is an external matter! Since we are calculating time, there are many times longer than tens of billions of years (such as the time required for stars near the sun to evenly distribute energy is 10 trillion years), and there are times shorter than it (such as the time for the Milky Way to rotate is 20 million years). Why not calculate them in? This fully proves that tens of billions of years is completely accidental. The reason why some people regard coincidence as so important and do not look at it from the essence is to obtain wrong conclusions.

    Such a starting point and explanation are not satisfactory. The conclusions derived from it are not only inevitably wrong but also harmful. But why is this creation theory of the universe and the origin of the solar system widely spread in Western capitalist countries and societies? As Academician Schmidt once said: "The places where astronomers are not satisfied are precisely the places that religious propagandists are eager to use." It is precisely the statement that the universe was "created" in 3 to 4 billion years, which astronomers oppose, that is used by religious propagandists as "God" "created" the world exactly 3 to 4 billion years ago; it is precisely the unique nature of the solar system collision origin theory, which astronomers are dissatisfied with, that is used by religious propagandists as "scientific" support for propagating "God's" great mercy and compassion in deliberately creating the solar system. In this way, we can clearly see how an idealist way of thinking can cause incorrect views, ultimately leading to the unknowability of the universe and blocking the future of scientific research itself.

    We can also ask, is it that science in capitalist society has never given correct materialist answers? In such a society, science has sometimes continued to play a certain role. Just like the solar system theory, there are currently people like Kuiper and Whipple in the West who are also developing some correct theories, but these theories are not derived from first mastering the materialist way of thinking and consciously leading to them; but are forced out of desperation. Therefore, the research and analysis that Schmidt engaged in 7 or 8 years ago is only now (1949-1951) being done by these people. The society in Western capitalist countries dominates the ideological consciousness of every scientific worker. In the near future, even a large pile of contradictions will not force out any materialist, developmental, and promising scientific direction. Astronomical workers with an idealist way of thinking are unconsciously building spiritual walls for themselves and the entire society with their own hands and brains, and one day they will find that this wall only surrounds themselves.

    The materialist theory of the origin of celestial bodies is just the opposite, starting from the actual complex phenomena, analyzing, researching, and raising it to principles. In its process, it always focuses on verification in practice and is not confused by superficial coincidences. Therefore, it cannot but lead to a changing and developing theory, so that in the field of astronomy, it continues to open up new, bright, and effective research paths, and continues to enrich the foundation of the materialist worldview.

    (IV) The Role of Astrophysics in Establishing a Correct Materialist Worldview

    Undeniably, the above two issues, which are closely related to the materialist worldview, have not yet been finally resolved. For example, the stellar association theory still needs to rely on astrophysics and physics to study and solve how interstellar matter is organized into stars in such a way. The shortcomings and blanks in Schmidt's planet origin theory are even more numerous, such as explaining that the rotation and revolution periods of Mercury are consistent, the rotation period of the moon around the earth is consistent, how the interstellar matter with large rotations is connected to the sun, and the detailed physical steps of the condensation of interstellar matter, etc. All these problems are problems of astrophysics. Only detailed research by all departments of astrophysics and other scientific work can solve these problems. In fact, as Professor Kukarkin said in Pravda, the great progress of astrophysics in the Soviet Union in the past 20 years has made it possible to solve the theory of the origin of celestial bodies. In fact, if you want to ask what the ultimate purpose of constantly analyzing celestial spectra, observing the changes in the intensity of starlight, and constantly applying all physical knowledge to study the possible various celestial structures and movement conditions in astrophysics is, the only answer is to accumulate more materials and establish the rule of materialism in the sky, so that idealists and mystics who can no longer stand on the ground and in the laboratory cannot freely defend themselves by relying on the phenomena in the sky that are not easy to understand. This is the last position that materialism must seize, and astrophysical work is the only weapon to seize this position. Of course, this work is not as easy as experimenting on objects at will in the laboratory (this can be seen from the fact that the laws discovered in the recent 100 years of astronomical history are far fewer than the laws discovered in physics or other sciences), but the belief that we will eventually win is something that every astrophysicist has. The great achievements of Soviet astrophysicists are a very eloquent proof.
