    Old Worker Zhang Xinquan of Beijing Railway Sub-bureau
    Persuades Son to Confess Illegal Acts
    Comrade Editor: Zhang Xinquan is an old worker at the Beijing Vehicle Depot of the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau. His son, Zhang Wenxiao, works as a train attendant at the Vehicle Depot. In June 1950, Zhang Wenxiao met a merchant who was smuggling gold and silver dollars. Through the merchant's constant enticements, Zhang Wenxiao was dragged into the water and smuggled goods a total of ten times, obtaining over six million yuan in illicit gains. After the launch of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, he had ideological concerns. As a result, he spoke evasively and downplayed the seriousness of his actions, refusing to make a complete confession. After listening to the mobilization report at the meeting, old worker Zhang Xinquan understood the government's policy. He said to his son, "You must clarify your own problems." A five-day short-term study session further improved Zhang Xinquan's understanding. He made a guarantee in his group: "I will definitely help my son solve his problems when I get back." On January 26, based on the materials he knew from the past, he questioned his son about the matters one by one, causing his son to sweat profusely and unable to hide the truth, finally revealing all his problems. He also demanded that his son immediately hand over the ill-gotten gains of one tael and seven mace of gold and two hundred silver dollars. With his father's help, Zhang Wenxiao put down his burden.

    北京铁路分局老工人张心泉
    说服儿子坦白违法行为
    编辑同志：张心泉是北京铁路分局北京车辆段的老工人，他的儿子张文孝在车辆段当乘务员。一九五○年六月，张文孝认识了一个走私黄金、白洋的奸商。经过奸商的不断利诱，张文孝被拖下了水，共走私十次，得到赃款六百多万元。反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，他有思想顾虑。这样，他就吞吞吐吐、避重就轻地说了一些，始终不肯彻底交代。老工人张心泉听了大会的动员报告，了解了政府的政策。他对儿子说：“你的问题，你自己要弄清楚。”五天的短期学习使张心泉的认识更提高了，他在小组上提出保证：“回去一定帮助儿子解决问题。”一月二十六日，他根据过去所知的材料，一件一件地向他的儿子追问，问得他儿子满头大汗，无法掩饰，才把所有问题谈明白。他还要儿子立即交出赃款黄金一两七钱和二百块白洋。张文孝在他父亲帮助下，放下了包袱。  冯元志
