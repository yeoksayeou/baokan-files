To the Editor:
    Guo Fushou, a rural postal worker from Xianghe County, Hebei Province, who stole remittances intended for the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and refused to confess, was arrested by the Xianghe County People's Government on February 2nd. In the past year, Guo embezzled more than 11 million yuan of public funds. He privately carved sixty-nine seals bearing the names of villages and individuals, fraudulently claimed remittances, and falsified accounts. He frequently withheld newspapers and letters, and sold newspapers. Eleven insured letters and sixteen registered letters containing remittances, which he had opened privately, were found in his mailbag. Among these twenty-seven letters, three were sent by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to their families. The Volunteer Army soldiers save a little money on the front lines to send home, but Guo embezzled it. One Volunteer Army family member even mistakenly believed that his son was deceiving him because he did not receive the money. I demand that the Xianghe County People's Government severely punish this conscienceless and despicable embezzler.

    应严厉制裁贪污志愿军汇款的郭福寿
    编辑同志：河北香河县人民政府在二月二日逮捕了盗窃志愿军汇款而又拒不坦白的邮局乡交员郭福寿。去年一年中，郭犯侵占公款一千一百多万元。他私刻了六十九个村名及人名的印章，冒领汇款，伪造账目。他经常扣压报纸、信件，出卖报纸。在他的信件袋中已查出他私拆的保价信件十一封，汇款挂号信十六封。在这二十七封信中，有三封是中国人民志愿军寄给他们的家属的。志愿军在前线把节约下来的一点钱寄给家里，竟被郭犯贪污了。有个志愿军家属就因收不到钱而误认为他的儿子是在哄他。我要求香河县人民政府严厉制裁这个丧尽天良、卑鄙无耻的贪污分子。    赵文海
