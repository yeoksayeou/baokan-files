Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 9th: According to news from Tokyo: The Japanese government, on the orders of the American occupation authorities, is preparing to conduct large-scale suppression of the Japanese Communist Party and other democratic groups. Recently, Japanese authorities have been creating various "incidents" and placing the blame on members of the Japanese Communist Party. Police authorities and bourgeois newspapers are spreading provocative rumors saying that the Communist Party intends to launch a "general uprising" on February 10th.
    All Communist Party members of the Japanese Diet issued a statement on February 7th to protest the Yoshida government's provocative policy.
    Many trade unions and democratic groups issued a joint statement on February 8th, protesting the Yoshida government's acts of violence. These trade unions and democratic groups include: the All-Japan Congress of Industrial Unions, the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, the All-Japan Metal Workers' Union, the All-Japan Printing and Publishing Workers' Union, the All-Round Peace Loving Patriotic Movement Council, the Democratic Women's Council, the Japan Youth Fatherland Front, the Korean Liberation Relief Association, and other groups. The statement pointed out: The Japanese government is attempting to suppress trade unions and groups that oppose rearmament and exorbitant taxes.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 12th: The Japanese Communist Party Diet Members Group issued a statement on February 9th, condemning the conspiracy of the Yoshida government and the Liberal Party to declare the JCP illegal. According to TASS Tokyo, the statement is as follows:
    "The Liberal Party recently passed a resolution aimed at declaring the Japanese Communist Party illegal, and, according to many reports, the Liberal Party has already begun to engage in conspiracies in order to implement this decision. The traitors who sold out the Japanese people concluded a separate peace treaty and a security treaty, and they are now secretly negotiating with the US government to conclude an administrative agreement, which will mean selling out Japan and rearming Japan.
    Moreover, they are eager to pass a law to control various groups in order to suppress the nationwide movement against the traitorous policy. In order to invade Korea, China, and Southeast Asia, they are sacrificing the vital interests and freedom of the Japanese people.
    However, the Japanese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are rising up to put up a resolute resistance and are fighting for liberation from shameful enslavement and for peace and independence. The conspiracy aimed at banning the Communist Party—the vanguard of the Japanese people—is itself a means of suppressing the Japanese people. We will conduct a resolute struggle together with all patriots against the illegal attempt of the Liberal Party and the Yoshida government to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal."
    Xinhua News Agency, February 11th: According to Dentsu News Agency Prague: The American and British bourgeois newspapers are forced to admit that Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida's recent letter to Dulles expressing Japan's willingness to conclude a treaty with the Kuomintang remnant group has been strongly opposed by the majority of the Japanese people, and the Yoshida government's position has therefore become even more isolated.
    The American "Newsweek," which is close to the State Department, pointed out in its latest issue that "Yoshida's publication of this letter was approved by Washington in advance." This letter is "a moving performance of the last political seppuku."
    The London "Times" correspondent in Washington reported on Yoshida's letter to Dulles, saying: "According to news from Tokyo, the impact of this letter on the Yoshida government is serious."
    The "New York Times" correspondent in Tokyo, Barrett, reported that Yoshida government's "guns or butter" program and Yoshida's attitude towards China have placed the Yoshida government in the "lowest ebb" among the Japanese people. Barrett talked about the Yoshida government's budget, saying: "Even the National Democratic Party, which often stands on the side of the Liberal Party on major issues, has severely criticized it this week. ... The question is, how to raise this money other than greatly reducing the already low Japanese standard of living."

    美日反动派制造藉口阴谋迫害日共
    日共国会议员抗议吉田挑衅暴行
    许多工会和民主团体联合声明反对吉田的镇压阴谋
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社东京九日讯：据东京方面消息说：日本政府奉美国占领当局的命令，正在准备对日本共产党和其他民主团体进行大规模的镇压。近来日本当局一直在制造各种“事件”，把责任都推到日本共产党党员的身上。警察当局和资产阶级报纸正在散布挑衅性的谣言说：共产党打算在二月十日发动“总暴动”。
    日本国会全体共产党议员特就此事在二月七日发表声明，抗议吉田政府这种挑衅政策。
    许多工会和民主团体在二月八日发表联合声明，抗议吉田政府的暴乱行为。这些工会和民主团体有：全日本产业别工会会议、全递信工人工会、全日本金属工人工会、全日本印刷出版工人工会、全面媾和爱国运动协议会、民主妇女协议会、日本青年祖国阵线、朝鲜解放救援会以及其他团体。声明指出：日本政府企图镇压反对重新武装和苛捐杂税的工会和团体。
    【新华社十二日讯】日本共产党国会议员团于二月九日发表声明，斥责吉田政府和自由党企图宣布日共为非法的阴谋。据塔斯社东京讯，该声明如下：
    “自由党最近通过了旨在宣布日本共产党为非法的决定，并且，据许多消息说，自由党已经开始进行阴谋活动，以便把这个决定付诸实施。出卖日本人民的奸贼缔结了单独和约与安全条约，他们现在正与美国政府秘密谈判缔结行政协定的事，这个协定将意味着出卖日本和重新武装日本。
    而且，他们急于通过一条对各种团体加以控制的法律，以抑制全国范围反对卖国政策的运动。为了要侵略朝鲜、中国和东南亚，他们不惜牺牲日本人民的切身利益和自由。
    但是，日本人民在共产党的领导下，正在起来作坚决的抵抗，为从可耻的奴役中获得解放以及为和平与独立而进行斗争。旨在禁止共产党——日本人民的先锋队——活动的阴谋，本身就是对日本人民的压制手段。我们将与所有的爱国人士一起进行坚决的斗争，反对自由党和吉田政府想宣布日本共产党为非法的非法企图。”
    【新华社十一日讯】据电通社布拉格讯：美英资产阶级报纸被迫承认，日本首相吉田最近写给杜勒斯的表示日本愿意与国民党残余集团缔结条约的信，遭到大多数日本人民的强烈反对，吉田政府的地位因此已更加陷于孤立。
    接近国务院的美国“新闻周刊”在最近一期中指出，“吉田发表他这封信事先得到过华盛顿的许可”。这封信是“最后一个政治切腹自杀的动人表演”。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”驻华盛顿记者报道吉田给杜勒斯的信说：“据东京消息，这封信对吉田政府的影响是严重的。”
    “纽约时报”驻东京记者巴罗特报道说，吉田政府的“大炮或牛油”的纲领以及吉田对中国的态度，已使吉田政府在日本人民中间的境况处于“最低潮”。巴罗特谈到吉田政府的预算说：“甚至在重大问题上往往与自由党站在一边的国民民主党，本周也痛加抨击。……问题是，除了大大降低已经很低的日本生活水平外，怎样来筹这笔钱。”
