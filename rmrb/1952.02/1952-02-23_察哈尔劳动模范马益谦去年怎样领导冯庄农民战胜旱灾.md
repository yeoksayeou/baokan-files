Last year, Chahar Province suffered a severe drought, with the province averaging only about 30% of a normal harvest. However, Fengzhuang Village in Huai'an County achieved a 70% harvest. The village's water conservancy conditions were no better than other villages, but the farmers, under the leadership of labor model Ma Yiqian, overcame the drought.

In the winter before last, to prevent drought and preserve soil moisture, Ma Yiqian led the masses in rolling the winter land to maintain a certain level of moisture, which played a significant role in drought-resistant sowing in the spring. Last spring, when drought appeared, he led everyone in completing drought-resistant sowing using the "dry seeding" method and planting followed immediately by rolling (using a stone roller). To continue fighting the drought, after the seedlings emerged, he put forward the slogan of "water one, save one" to the masses, mobilizing them to dig wells and carry water to irrigate the seedlings. In addition, based on the principle of "three parts rain under the hoe," he increased the number of cultivations, changing the old habit of Fengzhuang farmers of only hoeing twice, and using more hoeing to prevent moisture evaporation. After Fengzhuang farmers received soaking rain in late July last year, under the leadership of Ma Yiqian, they completed the task of replanting and catch-up planting on 500 mu of land in one day.

Ma Yiqian played a leading role in every specific task. Last year, when the government called on people to dig wells and build canals to fight drought and prepare for famine, some people in Fengzhuang had a fluke mentality of waiting for rain. They said, "Watering is useless, they will dry out sooner or later." "Can't water much, better wait for rain!" Ma Yiqian used the example of how he dug a well the year before, watered 2.5 mu of yams, and harvested more than 2,500 jin; while others who did not dig wells and water only harvested more than 200 jin per mu to persuade some farmers who were unwilling to dig wells to prevent drought. At the same time, more than a dozen members of the Fengzhuang Communist Youth League also cooperated with his propaganda, first watering half a mu of sunflowers for a military family. Seeing the sunflower leaves change from curled to stretched, the masses quickly overcame the idea of waiting for rain and accepted the method of digging wells for irrigation. Fengzhuang farmers dug twenty wells in four days, and irrigated more than 150 mu of land, including seventeen old wells.

Ma Yiqian also used practical examples to persuade those who did not believe in the "dry seeding" method for spring sowing and diligent hoeing for drought resistance. Taking diligent hoeing for drought resistance as an example, at first, some people in Fengzhuang could not understand the principle and were unwilling to hoe more. After Ma Yiqian's experiment, the masses saw that the crops he had diligently hoed were lush and recognized the benefits of diligent and careful hoeing. The whole village hoed the autumn crops three times, and some even hoed four or five times. This played a significant role in preventing drought and protecting seedlings.

When the drought was severe in July last year, in order to mobilize farmers across the province to overcome the drought, Ma Yiqian and all the farmers in Fengzhuang launched a challenge to labor models and farmers across the province, guaranteeing to do a good job in drought resistance and famine preparedness. The most important of their challenge conditions was to ensure that all men, women, old, and young in the village were mobilized to dig wells and build canals, and not to let the seedlings dry out; and to ensure that no land belonging to revolutionary martyrs' families or military families would be damaged by the drought.

The challenge of Ma Yiqian and all the farmers in Fengzhuang to labor models and farmers across the province, and the responses of labor models and mutual aid groups in many regions, further promoted the large-scale drought resistance and famine preparation movement in Chahar Province, enabling farmers across the province to make great achievements in the fight against drought. In terms of canal construction, water pond excavation, and well digging alone, by last autumn, the province had built more than 1,880 canals, excavated 130,000 water storage ponds for both drought resistance and flood prevention, and dug 4,350 wells; enabling many areas to protect their crops and overcome the drought.

    察哈尔劳动模范马益谦去年怎样领导冯庄农民战胜旱灾
    去年察哈尔省遭受了严重的旱灾，全省平均只得到了三成多年景。但是怀仁县冯庄却得到七成年景。这个村的水利条件并不比其他的村庄好，但是这个村的农民在劳动模范马益谦的领导下，却战胜了旱灾。
    前年冬天，为了防旱保墒，马益谦就领导群众滚压冬地，使土地保持了一定的水分，这对春季抗旱播种起了很大作用。去年春天发生了旱象，他领导大家用“干寄籽”和随种随压（用砘子压）的方法完成了抗旱播种。他为了继续向旱灾作斗争，在小苗出来以后，又向群众们提出“浇一棵，保一棵”的口号，发动群众打井和挑水浇苗。此外，他根据“锄头底下三分雨”的道理，增加了中耕的次数，改变了冯庄农民只锄两遍的老习惯，用多锄的办法防止水分蒸发。冯庄农民在去年七月下旬得到透雨后，在马益谦领导下，一天内完成了五百亩抢种补种的任务。
    马益谦在每项具体工作中都起了带头示范作用。去年政府号召挖井修渠抗旱备荒时，冯庄有一部分群众有侥幸等雨思想。他们说：“浇也没用，早晚要干死。”“浇不了多少，还是等雨吧！”马益谦就用他在前年挖了一眼井，浇山药两亩半，收了二千五百多斤；而其他没挖井浇水的每亩只收了两百多斤的实例来说服一些不愿打井防旱的农民。同时，冯庄十几个青年团员也配合了他的宣传，首先给一个军属浇了半亩葵花。群众看见浇了的葵花枝叶由蜷曲变为舒展，就很快地克服了等雨思想，接受了打井灌溉的办法。冯庄农民在四天内就打井二十眼，连旧井十七眼共浇地一百五十多亩。
    马益谦在发动群众用“干寄籽”办法春播和勤锄抗旱的时候，也都是用实际例子来说服不相信的人。拿勤锄可以抗旱说，起初冯庄有些群众想不通这个道理，而不愿意多锄。在马益谦试验以后，群众见经过他勤锄的庄稼枝叶茂盛，就认识到勤锄、细锄的好处，全村大秋作物都锄了三遍，有的甚至锄到四遍、五遍。这对防旱保苗起了很大的作用。
    去年七月旱灾严重时，为了发动全省农民战胜旱灾，马益谦和冯庄全体农民就发起向全省劳动模范、农民挑战，保证做好抗旱备荒工作。他们的挑战条件中最重要的是保证把全村的男女老幼动员起来，打井修渠，不让苗子干死；并保证不旱坏烈属军属一亩地等。
    马益谦和冯庄全体农民向全省劳动模范、农民的挑战和许多地区劳动模范、互助组的应战，进一步推动了察哈尔全省规模的抗旱备荒运动，使全省农民在向旱灾作斗争中做出很大的成绩。仅就修渠、挖水池和打井来说，到去年秋天为止，全省就修了一千八百八十多条渠道，挖了十三万个抗旱防洪两用蓄水池，打了四千三百五十多眼井；使不少地区保住了庄稼，战胜了旱灾。（宇）
