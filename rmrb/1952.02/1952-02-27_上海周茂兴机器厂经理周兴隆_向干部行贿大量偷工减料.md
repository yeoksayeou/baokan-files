Shanghai Private Machine Industry Fourth Joint Operations Group Zhou Maoxing Machine Factory, when contracted by Shanxi Province Textile Company to manufacture thirty double-box packing machines, used despicable means to bribe Shanxi Province Textile Company cadre Huo Lingyun, embezzling materials, delaying delivery, causing the state a huge loss of over 2.9 billion yuan. The losses caused to the state by this unscrupulous merchant are manifested in various aspects: (1) The manufactured packing machines did not meet specifications and were of poor efficiency. The contract stipulated that the pressing capacity of the double-box packing machine should be 130 kg to 150 kg per bale, but the delivered goods could only press an average of 120 kg. From November 1951 to January 1952, due to the reduced efficiency of the packing machine, more than 21,000 bales were packed fewer than planned. This caused the following series of losses: (1) More than 564 extra train cars were used, resulting in more than 1 billion yuan in extra freight charges.
    (2) More than 800 million yuan was spent on packaging. (3) The waste of labor, machinery, and miscellaneous expenses totaled more than 150 million yuan. The losses from the above three items have reached more than 2.08 billion yuan. (2) Embezzling materials and using inferior substitutes, incomplete machine parts. According to the confession of corrupt and bribery-taking element Huo Lingyun, eight woodworkings were stolen per packing machine, worth 200,000 yuan. Four ironworkings were stolen, worth 100,800 yuan. The contract stipulated the use of No. 1 iron, but Zhou Maoxing Machine Factory replaced it with No. 2 iron, with a price difference of 270,000 yuan per machine. When the iron was replaced, Huo Lingyun questioned it, and Zhou Xinglong, manager of Zhou Maoxing Machine Factory, bribed him 400,000 yuan. At present, it will cost 30 million yuan to add and replenish the missing parts and repair the damaged parts. Together with other embezzlement of labor, materials, and theft of materials, the state has lost more than 70 million yuan (actually more than this amount). (3) Delaying delivery. The contract stipulated that the goods should be delivered in batches by the end of September 1951, but as a result, they were not delivered until mid-October. When Huo Lingyun proposed to fine "one percent of the total value for each day of delay" according to the contract, Zhou Xinglong, manager of Zhou Maoxing Machine Factory, an unscrupulous merchant, wanted to bribe him 10 million yuan. He also said: "Old Huo! You are from the old liberated area, you are an old comrade, your life is very hard, you will no longer have to suffer when you arrive in Shanghai." According to Huo Lingyun's confession, Zhou Xinglong, manager of Zhou Maoxing Machine Factory, bribed Huo Lingyun a total of 2.09 million yuan. After Huo Lingyun accepted the bribe, he did not impose any fines on Zhou Maoxing Machine Factory that should have been fined. In this way, the state lost more than 210 million yuan.
    (4) The contract stipulates that the service life of the packing machine is ten years, but according to the current situation, it is estimated that as a result of embezzling materials and using inferior substitutes, the packing machine can be used for a maximum of three years. Depreciation of one-tenth of the total value of each packing machine per year, minus the estimated residual value of one-seventh, each machine loses more than 20 million yuan, and 30 machines lose a total of more than 600 million yuan.
    This order directly and indirectly caused the state to suffer a loss of 2.978 billion yuan.
    Around October 1951, Zhou Maoxing Machine Factory made about 15 single-box packing machines and more than 280 cotton gins for Jiangxi, Northern Jiangsu, and Southern Jiangsu Textile Companies, and made 8 cleaning machines and seed cleaning machines for Shandong Textile Company. The above transaction figures were about 3 billion yuan. It is understood that the unscrupulous merchants made huge profits from it, causing the state to suffer even more serious losses. We suggest that the People's Government severely punish this illegal merchant.

    上海周茂兴机器厂经理周兴隆
    向干部行贿大量偷工减料
    上海私营机器工业第四联营组周茂兴机器厂在承制山西省花纱布公司所订购的三十部双箱打包机时，用卑鄙手段贿买山西省花纱布公司干部霍凌云，偷工减料，延期交货，使国家遭受了二十九亿元以上的巨大损失。奸商给国家造成的这些损失表现在各方面：（一）所制打包机不合规格，效能低劣。合同规定双箱打包机的榨包容量为每包一百三十公斤至一百五十公斤，但所交货物却平均只能榨一百二十公斤。从一九五一年十一月份至一九五二年一月份止所榨棉包中，因打包机效能降低，计少成包二万一千多包。这就造成以下一系列的损失：（1）多用火车皮五百六十四个，计多化运费十亿多元。
    （2）包装用费多用八亿多元。（3）人工、机器、杂费的浪费共一亿五千多万元。以上三宗，损失已达二十亿零八千多万元。（二）偷工换料，机件不全。据贪污受贿分子霍凌云坦白，每部打包机偷木工八个，计二十万元。偷铁工四个，计十万零八千元。合同规定用一号铁，而周茂兴机器厂却换成二号铁，每部差价二十七万元。换铁时霍凌云曾提出质问，周茂兴机器厂经理周兴隆就向他行贿四十万元。目下要添配补足短少的零件及修理损坏部分，共需三千万元。连其他偷工、减料、偷料，共使国家损失七千多万元（实际还不止此数）。（三）延期交货。合同规定到一九五一年九月底分批把货交清，结果延至十月中旬才交清。霍凌云提出要按合同规定“误期一天按总值百分之一罚款”时，周茂兴机器厂经理奸商周兴隆就要向他行贿一千万元。并说：“老霍！你是老解放区来的，你是老同志，你的生活很苦，你到了上海就再不用苦了。”据霍凌云坦白，周茂兴机器厂经理周兴隆前后共向霍凌云行贿二百零九万元。而在霍凌云受贿后，就对周茂兴机器厂该罚的也不罚了。这样，使国家损失达二亿一千多万元。
    （四）合同规定打包机使用寿命为十年，但根据现状估计，偷工换料的结果，打包机最多能用三年。每年以每部打包机总值的十分之一折旧，减去预估残价七分之一，每部机器计损失二千多万元，三十部共计损失六亿多元。
    这次订货，直接间接使国家遭受了二十九亿七千八百多万元的损失。
    周茂兴机器厂在一九五一年十月左右曾给江西、苏北、苏南等花纱布公司做单箱打包机约十五台，轧花机二百八十多部，给山东花纱布公司做清花机，清籽机八部，以上成交数字约三十多亿元。据了解，奸商从中牟取暴利，使国家遭受了更为严重的损失。我们建议人民政府严惩这个不法奸商。
