[Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 22nd] At the staff meeting on the third agenda item of the Korean armistice negotiations on February 1st, when the issue of specific rear ports on both sides began to be discussed, our side suggested that three specific ports be designated in each side's area, and that neutral nations inspection teams inspect the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of weapons and ammunition entering Korea during the armistice within the limits agreed upon by both sides at the specific ports of both sides. However, the other side proposed an unequal and excessively large number of fifteen specific rear ports for our side and twelve for their side. Our side has repeatedly pointed out that the military personnel, weapons, and ammunition entering Korea during the armistice should and must be substantially reduced according to the agreement, and there is no need to designate too many specific ports. After our side proposed four specific ports per side on February 12th, the other side still insisted on the number of seven rear ports. On February 22nd, our representative pointed out: In order to carry out the rotation of military personnel and the replacement of weapons and ammunition during the armistice, the four ports proposed by our side are already sufficient to fully meet the reasonable needs of both sides, but in order to finally remove the other side's excuse for continuing to delay this issue and quickly resolve the third agenda item, we will make one more effort and propose five specific rear ports per side.

    Due to the continuous efforts of our side, the differences in the third agenda item have in fact been resolved or are close to reasonable resolution. The only major obstacle at present is the other side's insistence on unreasonably opposing our side's nomination of the Soviet Union to participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Regarding this, our representative solemnly pointed out:

    "We believe that the rotation issue has been reasonably resolved. The port issue has also been reasonably resolved due to our side's concessions. You have no reason to unreasonably insist on opposing our side's nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral nation as a member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. In order to reach a complete agreement on the third agenda item, in order to achieve an armistice in Korea, I demand that you withdraw your unreasonable opposition to our side's nomination of the Soviet Union as a neutral nation. Our side has repeatedly pointed out that you cannot provide any reason, nor is there any reason to oppose any of the neutral countries proposed by our side. The so-called two reasons you cited yesterday are untenable and cannot be considered any reason. The principled agreement between the two sides does not contain the two provisions you proposed at all. Your unique two reasons are fundamentally contrary to the principled agreement. You have no basis to prove that the fact that the Soviet Union is adjacent to Korea is sufficient to remove its status as a neutral country. Yes, the Soviet Union has been involved in the Korean issue. It used its powerful military force to drive the Japanese invaders out of Korea, and shortly thereafter, it withdrew the army that liberated Korea, but at that time the American army remained in South Korea and did not leave. Until the year before last, the United States again intervened in the Korean War, while the Soviet Union resolutely opposed interference in the Korean War and advocated a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. This not only does not hinder the Soviet Union from becoming a neutral country and participating in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, but on the contrary, precisely because of this record, the Soviet Union should be invited to participate in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission more than any other country. I once again demand that you withdraw your unreasonable opposition to the neutral countries proposed by our side."

    At the staff meeting on the fourth agenda item, our side stated that we cannot accept any ambiguous or unclear so-called "neutral" wording in the armistice agreement. If it is not based on the principle of unconditional release and repatriation of all prisoners of war held by both sides, many of the clauses currently being discussed are meaningless. Our staff further pointed out: The fourth agenda item has been in session for more than seventy days, and our side has made every effort, while the other side has not made corresponding efforts. Now, only if the other side begins to make real efforts to resolve the fourth agenda item and accepts and confirms the fair and reasonable principle of unconditional release and repatriation of all prisoners of war by both sides, can the fourth agenda item be resolved; otherwise, another seventy days of meetings will not produce any results.

    我方在第三项议程参谋会议上郑重指出
    苏联应该参加中立国监察委员会
    由于我方努力口岸问题已获得合理解决
    【新华社开城二十二日电】二月一日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议，开始讨论双方特定后方口岸的问题时，我方建议在双方地区内，各规定三个特定口岸，由中立国视察小组在双方特定口岸视察停战期间进入朝鲜的双方协议限度内军事人员的轮换，和武器弹药的替换。但对方却提出了要我方设十五个，对方设十二个特定后方口岸的不平等的而且过份庞大的数字。我方曾一再指出，停战期间进入朝鲜的军事人员与武器弹药，根据协议应该也必须有大量削减，无需规定过多的特定口岸。我方在二月十二日提出了每方四个特定口岸的建议后，对方仍然坚持七个后方口岸的数字。二月二十二日我方代表指出：为进行停战期间军事人员的轮换与武器弹药的替换，我方提出的四个口岸本已足以完全满足双方的合理需要，但为最后解除对方在这个问题继续拖延的藉口，迅速解决第三项议程，我们再作一次努力，提出每方五个特定后方口岸的建议。
    由于我方连续的努力，第三项议程中各项分歧，事实上已取得或接近合理解决。目前唯一重大障碍在于对方坚持无理反对我方提名苏联参加中立国监察委员会。对此我方代表郑重指出：
    “我们认为轮换问题已经获得了合理的解决。在口岸问题上由于我方的让步也已经获得了合理的解决。你方再没有任何理由无理坚持反对我方提名苏联为中立国作为中立国监察委员会的委员。为了达成第三项议程的全部协议，为了达成朝鲜的停战，我要求你方撤回你方对我方提名苏联为中立国的无理反对。我方已经多次指出你方提不出任何理由，也没有任何理由反对我方所提出的中立国中的任何一个国家。你昨天举出所谓两点理由都是不能成立的，也就是不能成为任何理由。双方的原则协议中根本没有你方所提出的两点规定。你们独出心裁的两点理由是根本违反原则协议的。你方没有任何根据来证明苏联邻近朝鲜的事实就足以撤除它的中立国的身份。是的，苏联曾过问过朝鲜问题。它曾用它的强大的军事力量将日本侵略者从朝鲜赶走，而且在不久之后，它就将解放朝鲜的军队撤走，但当时美国军队还留在南朝鲜不走。等到前年，美国又来进行干涉朝鲜的战争，而苏联则坚决反对干涉朝鲜战争和主张和平解决朝鲜问题。这不但无碍于苏联之成为中立国家，参加中立国监察委员会，正相反，正由于这种记录，苏联比任何国家都更应该被邀请参加中立国监察委员会。我再次要求你方撤回对于我方所提出的中立国家的毫无理由的反对。”
    第四项议程参谋会议上，我方声明停战协定中任何模棱两可含糊不清的所谓“中立”措辞，我方都不能接受。如果不以无条件释放，并遣返双方所收容的全部战俘这一原则为基础，现在所讨论的许多条款，就毫无意义。我方参谋人员进一步指出：第四项议程已开了七十多天的会，我方已尽了一切的努力，而对方则丝毫未作相应的努力。现在只有对方开始对解决第四项议程作真正的努力，接受并确定双方无条件释放并遣返全部战俘的公平合理的原则，第四项议程才能获得解决，否则再开七十多天的会也不会有任何结果。
