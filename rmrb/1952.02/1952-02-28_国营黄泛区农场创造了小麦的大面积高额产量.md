    State-run Huangfanqu Farm Creates Large-Scale High Yields of Wheat
    Li Chungui, Liu Peiliang
    The state-run Huangfanqu Farm was established in the autumn of 1950. It has a total area of more than 63,000 mu, and is a base for large-scale mechanized agriculture in the Central South region; it is also the largest state-run farm in Guannei [Inside the Passes] in terms of cultivated land area. The farm's land is divided into six districts, distributed in the southern part of Xihua County and the northwestern part of Fugou County, Henan. The climate there is good, with a frost-free period of about 210 days. The soil is mostly silt deposited by the Yellow River, and is very fertile, most suitable for planting wheat, and also very suitable for growing cotton. The terrain is flat and concentrated, facilitating mechanized cultivation.
    As everyone knows, the Huangfanqu (Yellow River Flood Area) was created by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in 1938 when they breached the dikes and released water at Huayuankou on the Yellow River in Zhongmu County. After the entire flood area was liberated in 1947, the people of the flood area, who had been displaced for ten years, were able to start living and working in peace. The People's Government implemented various production relief measures, the Huangfanqu Rehabilitation Bureau (an organization under the Flood Area Rehabilitation Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council) carried out a lot of flood area rehabilitation work, and organized mechanized cultivation teams to cultivate land for the peasants, so that most of the abandoned land was restored to cultivation. The vast number of peasants in the flood area rebuilt their homes. After the land reform, the peasants already had some means of production, and they were no longer satisfied with mechanized cultivation on their behalf, but were eager to improve the soil and improve technology to increase yields and increase income. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government established the state-run Huangfanqu Farm on the basis of the mechanized cultivation team of the Rehabilitation Bureau, on the one hand, to demonstrate to the masses and guide them to gradually move towards collectivization; on the other hand, to complete certain grain production tasks for the state.
    When the Huangfanqu Farm was first established in the autumn of 1950, it had to complete the task of sowing 8,450 mu of wheat fields. At this time, there were many difficulties in various tasks of the farm; first of all, this large area of land had just been adjusted from the land reform that autumn, and it needed to be adjusted immediately, divided into sections, in order to carry out mechanized cultivation and sowing. Secondly, leading cadres and drivers lacked experience in organization, division of labor, equipment allocation and sowing technology. There was also not enough time to fully prepare seeds and fertilizers. A total of six varieties of seeds were used, including Xuzhou 438, Foshou wheat, and Huangguaxian. Because the seeds were mixed, it was difficult to control the germination rate. There was no fertilizer at all. As for the basic construction of farm houses, etc., there was no foundation. At that time, the working comrades lived in temporary tents and simple houses far away from the farm. However, despite the poor conditions, a very high yield was achieved during the 1951 wheat harvest. On 8,450 mu of land, an average high yield of 209 jin per mu was achieved. This was twice as high as the average yield of the entire Henan province (104 jin) and 40 percent higher than the yield per mu of nearby farmers (150 jin).
    In the autumn of 1951, the area sown with wheat was expanded from 8,450 mu to 46,536 mu. Although the various working conditions had been initially improved after a period of harvesting and sowing, such a large area of planting added new difficulties in terms of sowing technology and management. But no matter what, the leading cadres of the Huangfanqu Farm, on behalf of all the staff and workers of the farm, made such a guarantee at the winter slack season training meeting of the State-owned Farm Administration Bureau of the Central Ministry of Agriculture in 1951: in 1952, the average yield per mu of the 8,450 mu of cultivated land that had been planted in the past would reach 350 jin, and the average yield per mu of all 46,536 mu of land sown would reach 200 jin. Judging from the current neat and vigorous emergence of wheat seedlings, as long as we continue to work hard in drought prevention, drought resistance, fertilization, and weeding, this guarantee can be fully realized.
    Why is it that the Huangfanqu State-owned Farm, which was only established for more than a year and whose conditions in all aspects are still very poor, can obtain and guarantee the realization of such a large area of high yield? There is only one reason, that is, it has the superiority of using machinery for collective labor on large areas of land.
    First of all, the farm's land is concentrated, which is not only suitable for mechanized cultivation, but also facilitates operation and management. Equipment allocation, personnel organization, crop cultivation, and even harvesting and other series of work can be carried out under a unified plan, and the production tasks can be completed in an organized and step-by-step manner. For example, during the 1951 wheat harvest, the farm organized a wheat harvest headquarters led by the farm director according to the specific situation, and after deliberation and discussion by all the staff and workers, formulated a detailed wheat harvest plan. All units of the farm, down to the production team, discussed and formulated their own plans and work progress in accordance with the unified plan, and prepared the overhaul of tractors and combines, the allocation of transportation tools, and the trial harvesting of combines on time. Therefore, the 8,450 mu of wheat was smoothly and timely harvested in just five days. For example, in the autumn wheat sowing work in 1951, the selection of varieties, the procurement and transportation of seeds, and disinfection were all prepared according to a unified plan. The sowing period, quantity, depth, etc. were also based on scientific theory and combined with practical needs, and a detailed technical implementation plan was formulated and submitted to each mechanized cultivation team for study, discussion and implementation. Therefore, in just seven days, the sowing of 46,536 mu of autumn wheat was completed in a timely manner. If this 40,000 mu of wheat was not sown by machines on concentrated land and under a unified plan, it would be difficult to imagine that it could be completed in such a short period of time.
    The entire production process of the farm, from cultivation to harvest, is all done using machinery for all important farm work. The farm has a total of 1,196 horsepower of tractors, 11 combine harvesters, and sufficient mechanical farm tools. During the autumn planting in 1950, using one tractor to pull a five-铧 plow to cultivate the land, an average of 8.7 mu could be cultivated per hour, and 80 to 90 mu could be cultivated per day working ten hours, with an average cultivation depth of 22 cm to 24 cm. After cultivating, using a 32-disc harrow to harrow the land, 30 mu could be harrowed per hour, with an average of 300 mu per day. When sowing, using three 24-row seeders connected for sowing, 40 mu could be sown per hour, with an average of more than 400 mu per day. This mechanized operation not only improved work efficiency dozens of times compared to farmers using manual labor, livestock power and old-fashioned farm tools, but also achieved deep plowing and fine harrowing, changed the physical properties of the soil, reduced pests, and retained moisture. Therefore, even without applying manure, a bumper harvest was achieved. Although the area of land sown in 1951 was expanded several times, it was still cultivated to a depth of 20 to 24 cm, and the land was harrowed two to three times with a disc harrow after rain. In order to ensure emergence, a medium-sized power seed selector was used for seed selection, and a total of more than 479,000 jin of wheat seeds were selected, and 76% of the wheat seeds were mixed with agents such as red arsenic and sodium fluorosilicate. Because a series of mechanized operations were carried out, not only were more than 40,000 mu of wheat sown between October 1st and 7th, but the sowing amount was uniform, and the sowing depth was about 5 cm, and the depth of soil covering was also very consistent. Therefore, except for a very small portion of the land that did not have enough seedlings due to not harrowing the land in time and having too many soil clods, most of the wheat seedlings were strong and flourishing. The local farmers all envied and said: "Tractors are good, they plant fast and well, how can we not harvest more grain!"
    The workers of the Huangfanqu Farm carry out collective labor on the land of the state, and are constantly receiving political education and ideological education of collectivism. Every winter, they will be trained in winter slack season training classes for three months, learning politics and technology; in addition, they have been organized in the usual mechanical operations, so they have gradually changed from scattered and backward farmers to organized and disciplined agricultural workers, and have given full play to their high enthusiasm and creativity in production. This is an important factor for the farm to obtain a bumper harvest and have unlimited development prospects. During the 1951 wheat harvest, summer cultivation, and autumn planting, all the staff and workers of the farm enthusiastically launched a patriotic bumper harvest competition campaign. In each competition stage, many activists and model deeds emerged. For example, during the wheat harvest, the Sun Haishan Combine Team, which repeatedly won red flags, used a No. 6 tractor combine to harvest wheat, creating a new record of harvesting 79,050 jin of wheat in 24 hours (including the time required for maintenance, repair, shift handover, and unloading grain). Comrade Gao Yuting, a driver, saw the lack of transportation tools during the wheat harvest, and voluntarily suggested to the leadership to repair an old car that had been scrapped for several years. In addition to some new parts, most of the repairs used old materials, saving more than 100 million yuan. After the repair, it played a great role in ensuring the wheat harvest transportation work. In the autumn wheat sowing work, it initially took 16 to 18 minutes to add seeds to the three connected seeders. Later, after the workers studied the method of adding seeds, it only took 2 to 3 minutes to add seeds once, improving work efficiency by 6 to 8 times. During the competition, they used "Nazi" tractors to tow three seeders and implemented connected operations, creating a record of sowing 70.72 mu per hour. The Fifth Cultivation Team used a "Deaver" No. 1 tractor to tow three seeders, sowing an area of 1,070 mu in 12 hours, creating a superior achievement of averaging 89.16 mu per hour. These advanced records were created by the workers who were educated in patriotism and gave full play to their high labor enthusiasm. During the competition, the farm established a work inspection system and a division of labor responsibility system, and formulated standards for quotas and quantities, laying a preliminary foundation for scientific management and economic accounting.
    The farm's bumper harvest achievements have made the nearby peasants begin to see the beautiful prospects of China's agricultural collectivization and mechanization. They have organized themselves one after another, learning to adopt the farm's agricultural science and technology, and continue to request the farm to use machines to cultivate land on their behalf. After last year's wheat harvest, the farm has used machines to cultivate more than 11,970 mu of land for nearby farmers.
    After more than a year of operation and two winter slack season studies, the Huangfanqu Farm has now initially learned the advanced agricultural science and technology and successful experience in operation and management of Soviet state-owned farms. In order to effectively improve the soil and cultivate fertility, the farm is preparing to implement a crop rotation system with cotton and wheat as the main crops; in the spring of 1951, trial planting of crops such as alfalfa, cotton, and kenaf was carried out, and good results have been achieved. In addition to sowing more than 46,000 mu of wheat last autumn, the farm will also sow more than 1,200 mu of barley this spring. Since last winter, the farm has been carrying out a general fertilizer accumulation campaign, and has purchased a large number of ammonium sulfate fertilizers from the Northeast, preparing to apply a topdressing once this spring in conjunction with cultivation and weeding to ensure the completion of this year's bumper harvest plan.

    国营黄泛区农场创造了小麦的大面积高额产量
    李春桂  柳培良
    国营黄泛区农场是一九五零年秋天建立的。它的总面积共有六万三千多亩，是中南区大规模机械化农业的根据地；也是关内耕地面积最大的一个国营农场。全场土地共分六区，分布在河南西华县的南部和扶沟县的西北部。那里气候良好，无霜期有二百一十天左右。土壤大部分是黄河淤积土，都很肥沃，最适于种植小麦，也很宜于栽培棉花。地势平坦集中，便于机械耕作。
    谁都知道，黄泛区是蒋介石匪帮一九三八年在中牟县黄河沿岸的花园口决堤放水所造成的。一九四七年泛区全部解放后，流离失所达十年的泛区人民才得以开始安居乐业。人民政府实施了各种生产救济办法，黄泛区复兴局（中央人民政府政务院所属泛区复兴委员会下设置的机构）进行了许多泛区复兴工作，又组织机械耕作队给农民代耕，大部分荒废了的土地才恢复了耕种。广大泛区农民重建了家园。经过土地改革，农民们已有了部分生产资料，他们已不能满足于机械代耕，而是迫切要求改良土壤，改进技术来提高产量和增加收入。因此，中央人民政府农业部就以复兴局机械耕作大队为基础，建立了国营黄泛区农场，一面向群众示范，引导他们逐渐向集体化前进；一面为国家完成一定的粮食生产任务。
    黄泛区农场在一九五零年秋天一开始建立起来，就要完成播种八千四百五十亩麦田的任务。这时农场各项工作中的困难很多；首先，这大片土地才从当年秋季土地改革中调剂出来，需要马上调整土地、划分区段，以便进行机耕和播种。其次，在组织分工、机具配备和播种技术等方面，无论是领导干部或驾驶人员都还缺乏经验。种籽肥料也都来不及充分准备。种籽共用了徐州四三八、佛手麦、黄瓜先等六个品种，因为种籽庞杂，发芽率很难掌握。肥料根本就没有。至于农场的房屋等基本建设，更是没有基础。当时的工作同志都是住在临时搭起的帐篷和离场较远的简陋的房子里。但是，尽管条件很差，一九五一年麦收时，却得到了很高的丰产成绩。在八千四百五十亩土地上，每亩平均达到二百零九斤的高额产量。比较河南全省总平均产量（一百零四斤）高出一倍，比较附近农民每亩地的产量（一百五十斤）高出百分之四十。
    一九五一年秋季小麦播种，已由八千四百五十亩一下扩大到了四万六千五百三十六亩。虽然经过了一度的收获和播种，工作上的各种条件已有了初步的改善；但这样大面积的种植，在播种技术和经营管理上又增加了新的困难。可是不管怎样，黄泛区农场的领导干部已代表农场全体职工在一九五一年中央农业部国营农场管理局的冬闲集训会议上提出了这样的保证：在一九五二年，过去已种过的八千四百五十亩熟地每亩平均产量要达到三百五十斤，全部播种的四万六千五百三十六亩土地每亩平均产量要达到二百斤。就目前麦子整齐蓬勃的出苗情况来看，只要在防旱、抗旱、施肥、除草等方面不断努力，这个保证是完全可以实现的。
    为什么才成立起来一年多，各方面的条件还很差的黄泛区国营农场，能够得到和保证实现这样大面积的高额产量呢？原因只有一个，就是它具备了在大片土地上使用机械进行集体劳动的优越性。
    首先是农场的土地集中，不仅适于机械耕作，而且便于经营管理。机具配备，人员组织，作物栽培以至收割等一系列的工作，都可以在统一的计划下进行，有组织有步骤地完成生产任务。例如在一九五一年麦收时，农场根据具体情况，组织了由场长领导的麦收指挥部，通过了全体职工的酝酿讨论，拟订了详细的麦收计划，全场各单位，直到生产小组，都依次按照统一的计划来讨论制订了自己的计划和工作进度，按时做好了拖拉机和康拜因的检修、运输工具的配备和康拜因试割等准备工作。因此，八千四百五十亩大面积的麦子，仅仅五天的时间，就顺利地及时地收获完毕。又如在一九五一年秋麦播种工作中，品种的选择、种子的采购运输和消毒等，都是根据统一的计划进行准备的。关于播种时期、数量、深度等，也都根据了科学理论，结合实际需要，拟定了详细的技术实施计划，交由各机耕小组研究讨论，贯彻执行。所以仅仅七天工夫，就及时地完成了四万六千五百三十六亩大面积秋麦的播种工作。假若这四万多亩小麦不是在集中的土地上和统一的计划下用机械播种，在这样短的时间内播种完毕是很难想像的。
    农场从耕种到收获的整个生产过程，所有重要农活都是使用机械。这个农场所有的拖拉机，共有一千一百九十六匹马力，另有十一台康拜因收获机和足够的机械农具。在一九五○年秋种时，用一台拖拉机拖一付五铧犁耕地，每小时平均可耕八点七亩，每天工作十小时就可耕地八、九十亩，平均耕深在二十二公分到二十四公分。耕过后，用一台三十二片圆盘耙耙地，每小时能耙三十亩，每天平均三百亩。播种时用三台二十四行播种机连结播种，每小时可播四十亩，每天平均在四百亩以上。这种机械化作业，不仅工作效率比农民用人力畜力和旧式农具耕种提高了几十倍，而且可以做到深耕细耙，改变土壤的物理性质，减少虫害，保持水分。因此，虽然没有上粪，也得到了丰收。一九五一年的播种虽然土地面积一下扩大了好几倍，仍然耕深到二十到二十四公分，并在雨后用圆盘耙耙地二遍到三遍。为了保证出苗，曾用中型动力选种机进行了选种，共选出麦种四十七万九千多斤，并有百分之七十六的麦种采用红砒和氟矽酸钠等药剂拌了种。因为进行了一系列的机械作业，不仅四万多亩麦子在十月一日到七日七天里全部下了种，而且播种量均匀，播种深度都在五公分左右，覆土的深浅也很一致。因此除极少部分土地因为没有及时耙地，土块较多，以致出苗不足外，绝大部分麦苗都茁壮茂盛。当地的农民都羡慕地说：“拖拉机就是好，种得又快又好，怎么能不多打粮呢！”
    黄泛区农场的工人们，在国家的土地上进行集体劳动，时时在受着政治教育和集体主义的思想教育。每年冬季，要在冬闲集训班里受训三个月，学习政治和技术；加上在平时的机械作业中已经组织起来，所以他们已从分散落后的农民逐渐变成为有组织有纪律的农业工人，在生产中发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。这是农场得到丰产和有无限发展前途的重要因素。在一九五一年的麦收、夏耕和秋种中，全场职工热烈地展开了爱国主义丰产竞赛运动。在每一竞赛阶段，都曾涌现出许多积极分子和模范事迹。如在麦收时，屡夺红旗的孙海山康拜因小组利用六号拖拉机康拜因收麦，创造了二十四小时（包括保养、修理、交班、卸粮等所需的时间在内）收割小麦七万九千零五十斤的新纪录。司机高玉亭同志看到麦收时运输工具的缺乏，就自动地向领导方面建议把已报废数年的一辆旧汽车修复。修复时除部分新添零件外，大部分是利用旧料，节约一亿多元。修成之后，对于保证麦收运输工作起了很大的作用。在秋麦播种工作中，最初三台联接的播种机装添种籽需时十六到十八分钟，后来工人们研究出装添种籽的方法后，加种一次只需时间二到三分钟，提高工作效率六到八倍。竞赛中他们使用“纳齐”拖拉机拖带播种机三台，实施联结作业，创造了每小时播种七十点七二亩的纪录。第五耕作队利用“笛弗尔”一号拖拉机拖带播种机三台，十二小时内播种面积一千零七十亩，创每小时平均播种八十九点一六亩的优越成绩。这些先进的纪录，是工人们受了爱国主义的教育，发挥了高度的劳动热情而创造出来的。在竞赛运动中，农场已建立了工作检查制度和分工专责制度，制定了定额、定量的标准，初步打下科学管理和经济核算的基础。
    农场的丰产成绩，使附近的农民开始看到中国农业集体化机械化的美好远景。他们纷纷组织起来，学习采用农场的农业科学技术，并继续要求农场用机器代耕。在去年麦收以后，农场已用机器为附近农民耕种了一万一千九百七十多亩土地。
    经过一年多的经营和两次冬闲学习，现在黄泛区农场已初步学习到苏联国营农场的先进农业科学技术和经营管理上的成功经验。为了有效地改良土壤培养地力，农场准备实行以棉花、麦子为主的草田轮作制；一九五一年春季，曾进行了苜蓿棉花洋麻等作物的试种工作，并已得到良好效果。农场除去年秋季播种小麦四万六千多亩外，今年春季还要播种大麦一千二百多亩。从去年冬季开始，农场正在普遍开展积肥运动，并向东北购买了大批硫酸錏肥料，准备今年春季配合中耕除草普遍施用一次追肥，保证完成今年的丰产计划。
