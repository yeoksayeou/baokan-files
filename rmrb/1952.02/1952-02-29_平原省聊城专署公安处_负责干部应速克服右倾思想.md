    Pingyuan Province, Liaocheng Special District Public Security Office
    Responsible Cadres Should Quickly Overcome Right-leaning Ideologies
    Comrade Editor: A certain embezzler in the Liaocheng Special District Public Security Office of Pingyuan Province, during the period of suspension and explanation of the problem, not only did not honestly confess his mistakes, but also made things difficult in every possible way. He even complained that the room he was given was too small. He also brought his original correspondent with him, who was nominally a guard, but actually at his beck and call. I believe that it is inappropriate for embezzlers to continue to enjoy their original living standards during the period of suspension and explanation of the problem. This serious right-leaning ideology of the relevant responsible comrades in the office has created a very bad influence among the masses. Many people are afraid to boldly expose and report crimes when they see the attitude of leading cadres towards embezzlers. I believe that the leadership of the office should promptly conduct inspections, rectify the ranks, vigorously mobilize the masses, and seriously deal with embezzlers, so as to ensure the smooth development of the movement.

    平原省聊城专署公安处
    负责干部应速克服右倾思想
    编辑同志：平原省聊城专署公安处某贪污犯，在停职交代问题期间，不但不老老实实坦白自己的错误，反而百般刁难。他甚至责难给他住的屋子小了。他还带着他原来的通讯员，这个通讯员名义上是看守，实际上却任他支使。我认为，贪污分子在停职交代问题期间，仍享受原来的生活待遇，是不应该的。该处有关负责同志的这种严重的右倾思想，在群众中造成很不好的影响。不少人看到领导干部对待贪污分子的态度，就不敢大胆揭发检举了。我认为该处领导方面应该从速检查，整顿队伍，大力发动群众，严肃对待贪污犯，以便使运动顺利开展起来。  张林德
