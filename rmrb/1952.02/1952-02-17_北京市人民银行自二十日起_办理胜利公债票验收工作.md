    Beijing People's Bank to Begin Accepting Victory Bond Certificates for Verification Starting on the 20th

    [This Newspaper's Report] The second lottery for principal repayment of the 1950 First Issue People's Victory Commodity Bonds was held in Beijing on February 1st. Bondholders whose bond numbers end in the same two digits as the winning numbers announced by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government can, from March 31st, present their bonds to the People's Bank branches and offices to receive the principal and accrued interest. Holders of non-winning bonds can also present their bonds to the People's Bank to receive interest.

    To avoid congestion when bondholders redeem their principal and interest starting on March 31st, the Beijing People's Bank has decided to begin accepting winning bond certificates for verification in advance starting on February 20th. Bondholders can submit their winning and non-winning bonds to the nearest People's Bank in advance, and the bank will issue a receipt for pre-accepted bonds, paying the principal and interest when due. If organizations, factories, schools, groups, or industrial and commercial entities wish to collectively redeem bonds, they can contact the nearest People's Bank, and the bank will send personnel to handle the pre-acceptance procedures, paying the principal and interest when due.

    北京市人民银行自二十日起
    办理胜利公债票验收工作
    【本报讯】一九五○年第一期人民胜利折实公债第二次还本抽签，已于二月一日在北京举行。凡公债持有人债券号码末尾二字和中央人民政府财政部公布的中签号码相同者，都可以从三月三十一日起，凭票向人民银行各部及办事处领还本金和应得利息。没有中签的公债票，也可以凭票向人民银行领取利息。
    为了避免持票人在三月三十一日开始兑付公债本息时拥挤起见，北京市人民银行决定于二月二十日起，预先办理中签债票的验收工作。公债持有人可将中签及未中签债票预先交到附近的人民银行，由银行签发预收债票凭证，到期时付给本息。若有机关、工厂、学校、团体及工商业等集体兑领，可以与附近人民银行联系，由银行派员前往办理预收手续，到期时付给本息。
