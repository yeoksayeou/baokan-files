Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: The National Committee for the Defence of Children of China sent a cable to the Preparatory Committee of the International Conference for the Defence of Children regarding the bacteriological warfare waged by the American aggressors in Korea. The text of the cable is as follows:
To Madame Germaine Sainty, Preparatory Committee of the International Conference for the Defence of Children,

Dear Madame Sainty,

As we are enthusiastically and actively preparing for the upcoming International Conference for the Defence of Children, and as benevolent people from all countries around the world who care about children are thinking about how to better educate and raise our children to be healthier, the American aggressors, who have suffered military defeats on the Korean battlefield, are dragging out peace negotiations on the one hand and conducting inhumane bacteriological warfare on the other, attempting to use plague, cholera, and other malignant infectious diseases to destroy the defenders of peace and destroy all of humanity! We are extremely angry upon seeing this shocking news!

On behalf of all parents and people from all walks of life in China who care about the happiness of children, we suggest that the Preparatory Committee of the International Conference for the Defence of Children notify all national representatives preparing to attend the conference of this brutal and murderous news, to strengthen their confidence and determination to defend peace, and to more clearly recognize the necessity of holding our International Conference for the Defence of Children. Let us unite, strengthen the forces of peace, and stop wars of aggression! We firmly believe that this outrageously insane and barbaric crime will be subjected to the most severe sanctions by peace-loving people around the world who care about children and the future of mankind!

The National Committee for the Defence of Children of China

February 23, 1952

[This newspaper reports] The Chinese Young Pioneers' protest against the crime of the American invading army spreading bacteria in Korea briefly states: After the American imperialist aggressor troops were defeated in Korea, they pretended to negotiate with us on the one hand, but on the other hand, they frantically spread bacteria to poison our dearest volunteers, the Korean People's Army, the peaceful residents of Korea, and the children, in an attempt to save their defeated fate. We, the Young Pioneers and Young Pioneer members of all of China, express our boundless indignation and serious protest against this inhuman and shameful behavior!

We believe that this crazy and shameless crime of American imperialism is bound to fail. Our volunteers and the Korean People's Army are incomparably strong and brave, and they will redouble their efforts to strike at the shameless enemy; our people across the country will support them with greater determination and strength; and peace-loving people all over the world will also give them righteous assistance. American imperialism, like the German and Japanese fascists, will move towards death under the powerful blows of peace-loving people all over the world!

Let us be more firm and more actively participate in the work of resisting America and aiding Korea, support the volunteers, and completely defeat the American wolves!

    中国少年儿童队对美帝国主义撒布细菌提出严重抗议
    【新华社二十三日讯】中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会为美国侵略者在朝鲜进行细菌战争致电国际保卫儿童大会筹备委员会，电文如下：国际保卫儿童大会筹备委员会亲爱的加尔曼·桑蒂夫人：
    当我们正在以极大的热情积极筹备即将召开的国际保卫儿童大会的时候，当全世界各国关怀儿童的善良人士正在思考如何把我们的孩子教养得更好、更健康的时候，在朝鲜战场上遭到了军事上惨败的美国侵略者，一方面拖延和平谈判，一方面又进行了灭绝人性的细菌战争，企图用鼠疫、霍乱和其他恶性传染病来毁灭和平的保卫者，毁灭全人类！我们看到这个惊人的消息，万分痛恨！
    我们代表全中国所有关怀儿童幸福的父母和各界同胞建议国际保卫儿童大会筹备委员会，将这个残暴杀人的消息通报所有准备参加大会的各国代表，来加强保卫和平的信心和决心，更加明确地认识我们召开国际保卫儿童大会的必要。让我们团结起来，加强和平的力量，制止侵略战争！我们坚信：这种疯狂野蛮绝顶的滔天罪行，必将受到全世界关怀儿童、关怀人类未来的爱好和平的人们最严厉的制裁！
    中国人民保卫儿童全国委员会
    一九五二年二月二十三日
    【本报讯】中国少年儿童队抗议侵朝美军撒布细菌的罪行略称：美帝国主义的侵略军在朝鲜打了败仗以后，一面假装着和我们谈判，一面却疯狂地撒布细菌来毒害我们最亲爱的志愿军、朝鲜人民军、朝鲜和平居民和小朋友，妄想挽回他们失败的命运。我们，全中国的少年儿童和少年儿童队员，对这种没有人性的、可耻的行为，表示无限的愤慨和严重的抗议！
    我们相信，美帝国主义这种疯狂无耻的罪行，必定要遭到失败。我们的志愿军和朝鲜人民军是无比坚强和英勇的，他们将加倍努力来打击无耻的敌人；我们全国人民将以更大的决心和力量来支援他们；全世界爱好和平的人民也要给他们以正义的援助。美帝国主义将像德、日法西斯一样，在全世界爱好和平的人民的强有力的打击下，走向死亡！
    让我们更加坚定、更加积极地参加抗美援朝工作，支援志愿军，彻底打败美国野心狼！
