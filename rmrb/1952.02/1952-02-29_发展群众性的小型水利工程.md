    Develop Mass Small-Scale Water Conservancy Projects
    Farmers in Qingshan Township, Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, under the education of the Communist Party and the leadership of the township government, organized the labor force of the entire township, obtained assistance from the People's Government and support from farmers in neighboring townships, and after forty-six days of hard work, finally completed a small reservoir project that was originally planned to take six months. This ensures the irrigation of more than 3,000 mu of farmland and lays the foundation for overcoming drought and striving for a bumper harvest.
    Using the natural environment to build small-scale water conservancy projects to store river water and rainwater for irrigating farmland is an important method for eliminating drought. Currently, there are millions of small reservoirs, ponds, and dams in East China, Central South China, and Southwest China, irrigating most of the paddy fields in the Jiangnan area. These small reservoirs, ponds, and dams are the victorious fruits of hundreds of millions of farmers fighting against nature for many years, and also a valuable asset for the masses of farmers in their fight against drought. In order to expand the irrigated area and do a good job in drought prevention and resistance, all parts of Jiangnan should complete the repair and maintenance of existing reservoirs, ponds, and dams before the rainy season, and give full play to their irrigation benefits. We must call on farmers to continue to carry forward the fine tradition of fighting against nature, learn from the creative spirit of the farmers in Qingshan Township, Xindeng County, Zhejiang Province, take timely action, organize all forces, overcome difficulties, and launch a movement to build small reservoirs, ponds, and dams, and strive for a bumper harvest by expanding the irrigated area.
    In the northern provinces, drought occurs nine years out of ten, and small-scale water conservancy projects are not well developed. It is even more necessary to organize and lead farmers as early as possible, use all natural conditions to build farmland water conservancy, develop all water sources, and fight against drought. Of course, the widespread development of water sources will inevitably encounter many difficulties, such as the serious conservative thinking and reliance on heaven among the masses of farmers; building these projects will also face difficulties such as insufficient manpower and materials and technical problems that are difficult to solve. However, as long as the people's governments at all levels can fully attach importance to this work, use examples to break the conservative thinking and reliance on heaven among the masses, help farmers solve economic and technical difficulties, strengthen patriotic education, and stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of farmers, then these difficulties can be completely overcome.

    发展群众性的小型水利工程
    浙江省新登县青山乡农民，在共产党的教育和乡政府的领导下，组织起全乡的劳动力，并取得人民政府的扶助和邻乡农民的支援，经过四十六天的辛勤劳动，终于完成了原计划需时六个月才能完成的小型水库工程，保证了三千多亩农田的灌溉，打下了战胜旱灾争取丰收的基础。
    利用自然环境兴修小型水利工程，把河水雨水储蓄起来灌溉农田，是消灭旱灾的重要方法。现在华东、中南、西南地区，已有几百万处小型蓄水池、塘、坝等工程，灌溉着江南地区大部分的稻田。这些小型蓄水池、塘、坝工程，是多年来亿万农民向自然作斗争的胜利果实，也是农民群众向旱灾作斗争的一项宝贵财产。为了扩大灌溉面积，做好防旱抗旱工作，江南各地应当在雨季以前，完全做好现有的蓄水池、塘、坝等的修整、养护工程，充分发挥灌溉效益；号召农民继续发扬向自然作斗争的优良传统，学习浙江省新登县青山乡农民的创造精神，及时动手，组织一切力量，战胜困难，开展一个兴修小型蓄水池、塘、坝运动，为扩大灌溉面积争取丰收而斗争。
    北方各省十年九旱，小型水利工程又不甚发达，更需要及早动手组织领导农民，利用一切自然条件，兴修农田水利，开发一切水源，向干旱作斗争。当然，广泛开发水源，难免会遇到很多困难，例如农民群众中还有严重的保守思想和靠天吃饭思想；兴建这些工程也会有人力物力不足和技术问题不好解决等困难。但是，只要各级人民政府能够充分重视这一工作，用实例打破群众的保守思想和靠天吃饭的思想，帮助农民解决经济上和技术上的困难，加强爱国主义的教育，激发农民群众的积极性和创造性，那么，这些困难是完全可以克服的。
