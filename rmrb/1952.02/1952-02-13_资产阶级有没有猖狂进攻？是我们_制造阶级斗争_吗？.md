Has the Bourgeoisie Launched a Frenzied Attack? Are We "Manufacturing Class Struggle"?
    Wang Yunsheng

    The great struggle against corruption and bribery is unfolding nationwide. This struggle is bound to achieve complete victory, and we must resolutely, completely, cleanly, and thoroughly eliminate all corruption.

    Since Director Bo Yibo pointed out that "the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy is essentially a struggle against the corrupt and degenerate ideology of the bourgeoisie, and a resolute counter-attack against the frenzied attack launched by the bourgeoisie against the working class and the Chinese Communist Party in the past three years," and the Worker's Daily editorial raised the slogan "Resolutely Repel the Bourgeoisie's Frenzied Attack," this movement has been clearly elevated to the level of class struggle.

    As this movement surges forward, the bourgeoisie has raised protest-like questions, saying, "The bourgeoisie has not launched an attack on the working class and the Chinese Communist Party, let alone a frenzied attack." They also say, "This is intentionally manufacturing class struggle." Has the bourgeoisie launched a frenzied attack? Are we "manufacturing class struggle"? I would like to provide an answer here.

    The Struggle Against Corruption and Bribery is a Great Patriotic Movement

    First, I want to make it clear that the struggle against corruption and bribery is a great patriotic movement. In order to strive for the final victory in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, to thoroughly realize democratic reforms in all aspects of our country, and to gradually implement industrialization, so that national construction can smoothly move towards socialism, Chairman Mao has specially put forward three central tasks for the current state: to continue strengthening the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, to increase production and practice economy, and to carry out ideological remolding. In order to ensure the victorious accomplishment of these three central tasks, Chairman Mao has also specially called on: "All the people of our country and all staff members should unite, vigorously and swiftly launch a large-scale struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and wash away the filth left over from the old society!" Chairman Mao's leadership and call are great and correct. In the struggle against corruption, the severity of the discovered corruption is enough to endanger the fundamental victory of our people's revolutionary cause, and the frenzied attack of the bourgeoisie formed by illegal merchants' bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence in the past three years is even more serious, making it necessary to launch a nationwide struggle against corruption and bribery.

    The corruption and degeneration of government cadres are mostly inseparable from the bribery and enticement of illegal merchants. In this way, the wealth of the people's state is massively swallowed up, and revolutionary cadres and staff are constantly corrupted and degenerated. This situation has seriously damaged the interests of the state and the people, it will hinder the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and if it continues to develop, it may destroy our country's future of building socialism. If the People's Republic of China cannot be built into a strong and successful nation, the imperialist camp will inevitably become more rampant in its aggression, a third world war cannot be avoided, and that would endanger world peace. Isn't this situation serious? Isn't the nature of this problem serious?

    We must solemnly recognize that the struggle against corruption and bribery is a great patriotic movement of the Chinese people. If we can achieve a thorough victory in the struggle against corruption and bribery, we will protect the interests of the state and the people, guarantee the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, guarantee the future of national construction towards socialism, and safeguard world peace. This struggle has such solemnity, it is a great patriotic movement of the Chinese people.

    The Bourgeoisie Launched a Nationwide Frenzied Attack

    Has the bourgeoisie launched a frenzied attack? The answer is affirmative. Facts prove that the bourgeoisie has launched a frenzied attack, and it is a nationwide frenzied attack. The bourgeoisie's denial of having launched a frenzied attack on the working class and the Chinese Communist Party is a distortion of the facts. Indeed, the bourgeoisie has not held a national congress, formulated a common strategy, or issued a general attack order to the working class and the Chinese Communist Party; however, due to the bourgeoisie's nature of seeking profit only, harming others to benefit themselves, and engaging in speculation, they seize every opportunity and use various illegal means to strive for free development. Although there is no unified organization, they unanimously fight for the single purpose of illegal profits, forming a nationwide frenzied attack by the bourgeoisie.

    This frenzied attack by the bourgeoisie is extremely vicious. Because they are not using airplanes and cannons, but sugar-coated bullets. Chairman Mao pointed out this danger long ago, that "there may be some communists who have not been conquered by enemies with guns, and they deserve the title of heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the attack of sugar-coated bullets, and they will be defeated in front of sugar-coated bullets." The fact is exactly like this. In the past three years, the bourgeoisie has launched an attack on our people's regime with sugar-coated bullets, "pulling over" revolutionary cadres and "sending in" bourgeois spies. They act consistently throughout the country, with internal and external attacks, all using sugar-coated bullets. Countless examples of this viciousness have been published in national newspapers. We can look at the typical examples from major cities across the country:

    In Beijing, the major embezzler Xue Kunshan was sent in by the bourgeoisie, seizing the position of Deputy Director of the Business Section of the China Animal Products Company. He used his authority to steal state secrets, direct his own business firm, monopolize prices, engage in speculation and profiteering, and steal more than 2 billion yuan of state property. Another major embezzler, Song Degui, was pulled over by the bourgeoisie. He was the Director of the Administrative Section of the Central Public Security Department, a revolutionary cadre, but he was corrupted and enticed by unscrupulous merchants and jointly stole more than 900 million yuan of state property with them. In Tianjin, 31 major unscrupulous merchants, including Yang Jian'an, were arrested in one go, all of whom were thieves who corrupted revolutionary cadres and stole state property. In Shenyang, the embezzlement case of Na Cigong and the unscrupulous merchant Yang Zhenduo, who were sentenced to death, is a typical case of unscrupulous merchants colluding with government cadres to steal state property. In Jinan, the collective embezzlement case of the Shandong Provincial Construction Engineering Company involved 42 criminals, all of whom were corrupted and degenerated by colluding with unscrupulous merchants. In Hankou, the embezzlement case of Cui Mingqing of the Wuhan Department Store caused a sensation, and he was defeated by the sugar-coated bullets of the unscrupulous merchant Teng Zhenlu. In Guangzhou, Ren Haishan, the manager of the Guangdong Provincial Department Store, and others fell into the trap of the unscrupulous merchant Liu Xiongfei and were defrauded of huge sums of state funds. Xian Daxi, the Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Construction Bureau, was corrupted by unscrupulous merchants and stole state property. In Chongqing, a group of unscrupulous merchants illegally organized the "Star Four Dinner Party" to monopolize processing orders and steal more than 12 billion yuan of state wealth. In Taiyuan, unscrupulous merchants such as Su Xuemin often used bribery, prostitution, and other despicable means to collude with state functionaries. He alone corrupted 23 cadres from eight agencies, stealing more than 1 billion yuan of state property. In Shanghai, the embezzlement case of Lu Xingyuan, the director of the Engineering Office of the People's Broadcasting Station, is a typical case. This typical case illustrates how a revolutionary cadre with twelve years of Party membership was corrupted and degenerated under the enticement of money and women by unscrupulous merchants. In Hangzhou, the unscrupulous merchant Zhang Changgen was reported for tax evasion and killed the employee Chen Lianzhong, which was even more heinous. These examples, which are merely a few typical cases from various places, are enough to prove that the ugly crimes of illegal merchants have formed a nationwide frenzied attack by the bourgeoisie against the working class and the Chinese Communist Party. The facts are like this, undeniable.

    Shanghai's Illegal Businesses are Ungrateful

    When Shanghai was first liberated, the Shanghai business community had fallen into a desperate situation. The Kuomintang bandit gang's rabid plunder was primarily targeted at Shanghai. The "gold yuan notes," which were like ghost money, plundered all the gold and US dollars from the Shanghai business community. After liberation, the Kuomintang remnants colluded with American imperialism to blockade and bomb Shanghai. By the time of the February 6 bombing in 1950, the Shanghai business community was truly crippled, exhausted, and impoverished. At this time, it was the People's Government that rescued Shanghai with grain from Sichuan, coal from North China, and a large amount of materials from Northeast China and even the whole country. Following this, the People's Government adjusted the relationship between public and private sectors, purchasing unsalable goods from factories to maintain production; restricting the sales channels of state-owned companies to allow private businesses to have sales channels; and developing factories through processing orders. The People's Government also called on the working class to make self-sacrifices, allowing capitalists to reorganize institutions and reduce wages to overcome difficulties. Until last summer and autumn, when the supply of raw cotton was insufficient, the People's Government ordered all cotton mills to suspend work for one and a half months, and the wages during the suspension period were paid by the government as usual. As a result, the situation of industry and commerce generally improved, and it became generally profitable. The People's Government's care for industry and commerce benefited the Shanghai business community the most. How does the Shanghai business community treat the People's Government? At least a large number of illegal merchants in Shanghai are repaying the People's Government with acts of ingratitude such as bribery, tax evasion, and theft.

    If you don't believe it, look at the facts. Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Zhongni's report on "The Ungrateful Behavior of Illegal Businesses in Shanghai" is only a typical example selected from ten thousand. For example, the China Chemical Industry Company accepted orders for soap and perfumed soap, falsely reported the cost of grease and fragrances, and obtained exorbitant profits of more than 1 billion yuan. The Dazhong Metal Materials Factory colluded with its counterparts to resist the processing tasks of the East China Industrial Department, and also colluded with its counterparts to raise processing fees to the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, emphasizing loss rates, and obtaining exorbitant profits of more than 4 billion yuan. The sugar merchant Cheng Shunkang took advantage of the tense situation of American imperialism's aggression against Korea and its occupation of Taiwan to manipulate the market, drive up sugar prices, and seize exorbitant profits. Xia Yingkui, the head of the Da Zhonghua Electric Materials Company, nicknamed the "Tungsten Filament King," manipulated the tungsten filament market and obtained exorbitant profits of dozens of times. The head of the Paper Industry Association was commended for donating 100 million yuan for the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, appeared on camera, and was filmed in a movie, but the Minfeng and Huafeng Paper Companies evaded taxes of more than 11.8 billion yuan. The methods used by Chen Guozhen, the boss of Yongxianghua Bank, to corrupt state working cadres, included accompanying them in prostitution and gambling, giving bribes, and entertaining them with his concubines. This shows that the bourgeoisie will use any shameless means to make money and seek exorbitant profits. Even more intolerable is Wang Kangnian, the manager of the Dakang Pharmacy, who used fake and substandard medicines to defraud huge sums of money from the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's procurement of medicines, affecting the health of our heroic Volunteer Army soldiers. The Shanghai unscrupulous merchants have completely lost their conscience! The Shanghai movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence has just begun, and there may be thousands or tens of thousands of "tigers," large and small, waiting to be captured. There are still cases of concealment of enemy property in Shanghai's business community being reported, and the content may be shocking. As for well-known figures in the business community using state economic intelligence to manipulate prices and obtain exorbitant profits, it has become a topic of social conversation. There are also democratic figures who introduce their children to work in government agencies to engage in economic intelligence and do business. In short, there are many tricks of Shanghai merchants, and there are many "big tigers." The battle to fight tigers has been launched, and all "tigers," large and small, must be eliminated, especially to prevent "big tigers" from escaping!

    The bourgeoisie is so greedy and shameless! The illegal manufacturers in Shanghai are especially ungrateful!

    Bourgeois Ideology Wants to Gain the Upper Hand

    The Shanghai business community supports Chairman Mao's economic policies of "both public and private interests" and "both labor and capital benefit"; but the expression is not complete support, but conditional support, not comprehensive support, but one-sided support. As Director Xu Dixing said: they have put aside the leadership of the state-owned economy, and understood "both public and private interests" as "sharing the stage equally" and "dividing the spoils equally"; they have talked about "both labor and capital benefit" by canceling the leadership of the working class. In times of difficulty, they "both public and private interests," and when the situation improves, they "only care about private interests, not public interests." According to my contact experience, the Shanghai business community is not only unwilling to accept the leadership of the working class, but also wants the bourgeoisie's ideology to gain the upper hand. The basic ideology of the bourgeoisie is to seek profit only, harm others to benefit themselves, and engage in speculation, in addition to many other aspects. Since the liberation of Shanghai, the first manifestation of bourgeois ideology has been "failure to distinguish right from wrong." As soon as Shanghai was liberated, silver dollar traffickers "knocked on big heads" and inflated prices, creating a deafening noise; to catch thieves, catch the king first, the military control commission raided the securities building, and captured the "big tigers" who colluded with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to manipulate silver dollar traffickers to disrupt financial prices, and democratic figures from the business community came to the government to intercede and beg for mercy. The second manifestation of bourgeois ideology is "failure to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves," to the extent of "benefiting oneself by borrowing from the enemy." The large-scale concealment of enemy property by business people for their own use is an example. The third manifestation of bourgeois ideology is "failure to distinguish between public and private," to the extent of "using public office for private gain." This, like using one's political position to steal state intelligence, is a clear example. The fourth manifestation of bourgeois ideology is "sharing the stage equally," to the extent of wanting to "gain the upper hand." For example, in the labor-capital dispute at the Ruiyoutian Tea, Food, and Candy Store, the capitalist Chen Sen was so cunning and eccentric, using the means to deal with the enemy to deal with employees, making a mountain out of a molehill and expanding the dispute. The dispute lasted for more than half a year, and finally, an enlarged municipal consultation committee was opened, making a big splash, and the meeting lasted for eight and a half hours before it was concluded. The Municipal Shop Employees Union showed the loyal and generous spirit of the working class and published an open review. At another meeting of the Municipal Consultative Committee, the leader of the Federation of Industry and Commerce sternly reprimanded Shanghai newspapers for not criticizing the capitalists of Ruiyoutian in their news reports and demanded that the newspapers make public reviews. After the meeting, I told the responsible leader that both the Shop Employees Union and the leadership of the Federation of Industry and Commerce were responsible for the prolongation and expansion of the Ruiyoutian incident. The Shop Employees Union made a public review, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should also make a public review. The newspapers were not at fault and had nothing to review; the Federation of Industry and Commerce was responsible but did not review. That incident was when bourgeois ideology gained the upper hand. If this continues to develop, bourgeois ideology will strive for a leading position in the New Democratic system. A concrete example is that at a meeting of the Municipal Government Committee, the leader of the Federation of Industry and Commerce requested to revise Mayor Chen Yi's opening remarks to the Shanghai Municipal Second Session of the Third Representative Conference, because there were several sentences in the opening remarks: "We must resolutely establish the ideology of the proletariat as the only leading force, criticize all erroneous ideologies of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, and not allow any reactionary ideologies to damage the people's revolution and the people's democratic cause." It was said that after discussion by the representatives of the business community, it was unanimously believed that since the national bourgeoisie is one of the four major democratic classes, why should their ideology be said to be wrong and even reactionary? And they proposed revised wording. This proposal, which violated principles, was of course not passed. After the meeting, some people believed that class struggle appeared at that meeting. Can it not be said that this is bourgeois ideology wanting to strive for "sharing the stage equally" and even "gaining the upper hand"!

    Today is the Working Class's Counterattack Against the Bourgeoisie

    Are we "manufacturing class struggle"? The answer is no. The facts prove that it is the class struggle of the bourgeoisie launching a frenzied attack against the working class and the Chinese Communist Party; today, under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, the national people are launching a struggle against corruption and bribery, which is the working class's counterattack against the bourgeoisie. If the working class does not counterattack in today's serious situation, and allows the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack to develop even more frantically, the interests of our national people cannot be protected, the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea cannot be protected, the future of national construction towards socialism cannot be protected, the imperialist aggression will be even more rampant, and world peace cannot be protected. The situation is such that there is no turning back. All Chinese people, especially the worker brothers of the ruling class of the state, must unanimously accept Chairman Mao's great call and resolutely repel the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack! This is a great patriotic struggle to protect the interests of the national people, guarantee the victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, ensure the socialist future, and defend world peace. Advance bravely and vow to win a complete victory! In this great patriotic struggle, will the national bourgeoisie be eliminated? Will the national bourgeoisie be expelled from the people's democratic united front? No! Our struggle is to capture the "big tigers" who swallowed the country's wealth, to repel the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack on the people's regime, and to strive to transform the dark and decadent ideological essence of the national bourgeoisie, which seeks profit only, harms others to benefit themselves, and engages in speculation. Therefore, the victorious result of this struggle is not only in the interests of the state and the people, but also in the interests of the national bourgeoisie. The other side of the victorious result of this struggle is that the Chinese national bourgeoisie will be reformed, and our people's democratic united front will be more consolidated. Therefore, this struggle is still for unity, for a more consolidated people's democratic united front. Patriotic national capitalists and legitimate business people, everyone should stand firm on the people's position, stand firm on the position of abiding by the Common Program, accept Chairman Mao's great call, and under the leadership of the working class, join the people of the whole country in jointly launching a great patriotic battle against corruption and bribery, exposing illegal merchants, helping backward merchants to progress, thereby rectifying the ranks of the business community and achieving the transformation and progress of the national bourgeoisie.

    资产阶级有没有猖狂进攻？是我们“制造阶级斗争”吗？
    王芸生
    反贪污反行贿的伟大斗争，正在全国规模地展开。这一斗争，势必获得全胜，一定要坚决、全部、干净、彻底地消灭一切贪污现象。
    自从薄一波主任指出了：“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，本质上就是反对资产阶级腐化堕落思想的斗争，也就是对于资产阶级在三年以来向着工人阶级和中国共产党所举行的猖狂进攻来一个坚决的反攻。”工人日报社论又揭出了“坚决打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻”的口号，这一运动遂明确提高到阶级立场的水平。
    在这运动汹涌开展之际，资产阶级提出抗议式的问题了，说：“资产阶级并没有向着工人阶级和中国共产党举行进攻，更没有猖狂进攻。”又说：“这是有意制造阶级斗争。”资产阶级有没有猖狂进攻？是我们“制造阶级斗争”吗？我想在这里做一个答复。
    反贪污反行贿斗争是伟大的爱国运动
    我首先要说明的，反贪污反行贿斗争是伟大的爱国运动。为了争取抗美援朝的最后胜利，为了我们国家在各方面彻底实现民主改革和逐步实行工业化，使国家建设顺利向社会主义前进，毛主席特为当前国家提出三项中心任务，即：继续加强抗美援朝、增产节约和思想改造。为了保障这三项中心任务的胜利达成，毛主席又特别号召：“我国全体人民和一切工作人员一致起来，大张旗鼓地，雷厉风行地，开展一个大规模的反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的斗争，将这些旧社会遗留下来的污毒洗干净！”毛主席的领导和号召是伟大而正确的。在反贪污的斗争中，已发现贪污现象的严重程度足以危害我们人民革命事业的根本胜利，而三年以来不法商人的行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料和盗窃国家经济情报所形成的资产阶级猖狂进攻更加严重，非发动一个全国规模的反贪污反行贿的斗争不可了。
    机关干部的贪污蜕化，绝大多数是和不法商人的行贿勾诱分不开的。这样，人民国家的财富大量大量地被侵吞，革命干部工作人员不断地被腐蚀变质。这种情形，业已严重地损害了国家人民的利益，它将障碍了抗美援朝的胜利，再发展下去，就可能要毁灭了我们国家建设到社会主义的前途。中华人民共和国如不能强大建设成功，帝国主义阵营就必然更猖狂侵略，第三次世界大战就不能避免，那就危害了世界和平。这情形还不严重吗？这问题的性质还不严重吗？
    我们一定要严正认识：反贪污反行贿的斗争，是中国人民的伟大的爱国运动。我们能够争取到反贪污反行贿斗争的彻底胜利，就保护了国家人民的利益，就保障了抗美援朝的胜利，就保证了国家建设到社会主义的前途，就保卫了世界和平。这一斗争，具有如此的庄严性，是中国人民的伟大的爱国运动。
    资产阶级举行了全国规模的猖狂进攻
    资产阶级有没有猖狂进攻呢？这答案是肯定的，事实证明资产阶级是举行了猖狂进攻，而且是举行了全国规模的猖狂进攻。资产阶级不承认曾经对工人阶级和中国共产党举行了猖狂进攻，是歪曲了事实的。的确资产阶级未曾开过全国大会，未曾制定共同战略，未曾向工人阶级和中国共产党下过总攻击令；但是由于资产阶级具有唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的本质，他们利用一切机会，以各种不同的非法手段，争取自由发展，虽然没有统一的组织，却纷纷一致地为非法暴利的一个目的作战，就形成资产阶级全国规模的猖狂进攻。
    资产阶级这种猖狂进攻，是非常毒恶的。因为他们用的不是飞机大炮，而是糖衣炮弹。毛主席早就指出过这种危险，就是：“可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿着枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。”事实正是如此。三年以来，资产阶级纷纷以糖衣炮弹向我们人民政权进攻，把革命干部“拉过去”，把资产阶级的奸细“派进来”，全国一致，内外夹攻，用的都是糖衣炮弹。这种恶毒的例子，全国报上登载的已经多不胜计，我们可以举全国各大城市的典型例子来看看：
    在北京，大贪污犯薛昆山，是资产阶级派进来的，窃据了中国畜产公司业务处副处长的地位，利用职权，盗窃国家机密，指挥他自己的商号，垄断价格，投机倒把，盗骗国家资财二十余亿元。另一个大贪污犯宋德贵，是被资产阶级拉过去的，他是中央公安部的行政处长，是革命干部，被奸商腐蚀勾诱，和奸商共同盗窃国家财产九亿余元。在天津，一次逮捕大奸商杨健庵等三十一名，个个都是腐蚀革命干部、盗窃国家资财的蟊贼。在沈阳，判处死刑的贪污犯那次公和奸商杨振铎，是奸商勾结机关干部盗窃国家财产的典型案件。在济南，山东省建筑工程公司的集体贪污案，罪犯四十二人，都是和奸商勾结而被腐蚀蜕化的。在汉口，武汉市百货公司崔明卿贪污案轰动一时，他就是被奸商滕镇鲁的糖衣炮弹打垮的。在广州，广东省百货公司经理任海山等堕入奸商刘雄飞的圈套，被骗去国家巨款。广州市建设局副局长冼达熹，被奸商腐蚀，盗窃国家财产。在重庆，一批奸商非法组织“星四聚餐会”，垄断加工订货，盗窃国家财富一百二十余亿元。在太原，奸商苏学敏等经常以行贿、嫖妓等下流手段，勾贿国家工作人员，他一个人就腐蚀八个机关的二十三个干部，窃取国家财产十亿元以上。在上海，人民电台工务室主任路星元贪污案是个典型，这个典型，说明一个具有十二年党龄的革命干部是怎样在奸商的金钱女色引诱之下被腐蚀蜕化的。在杭州，奸商张长根因偷税漏税被检举因而杀死职工陈连仲，更是凶恶。这些例子，只是挂一漏万的略举各地典型，就足以证明不法商人的丑恶罪行已经形成资产阶级向着工人阶级和中国共产党举行了全国规模的猖狂进攻。事实如此，无可否认。
    上海不法厂商忘恩负义
    上海初解放时，上海工商界已整个陷入绝境。国民党匪帮穷凶极恶的搜括，首要的目标在上海。冥钞式的“金圆券”，把上海工商界的黄金美钞掠夺一空。解放以后，国民党残匪又勾结美帝国主义对上海进行封锁和轰炸。至一九五○年二六轰炸时，上海工商界真是疲癃残废，困顿不堪了。在这时，是人民政府以四川的粮食、华北的煤及东北以至全国的大量物资，来救济上海。继此而后，人民政府调整公私关系，收购厂商囤不能售的冷货，以维持生产；限制国营公司的销场，使私营商业得到销路；又以加工订货使各厂发展；人民政府又号召工人阶级自我牺牲，让资方整编机构，减少工资，以度过难关。直到去年夏秋之间，以原棉接济不足，人民政府又令各纱厂停工一个半月，停工期间的工资由政府照发。由此，工商业情况普遍好转了，普遍有利可图了，人民政府对工商业的照顾，上海工商界受惠最多。人民政府对待上海工商界，真可谓仁至义尽。上海工商界怎样对待人民政府呢？至少占上海工商界极大比数的不法厂商，是报答人民政府以行贿、偷漏、盗窃等忘恩负义的行为。
    不信，看看事实。新华社记者徐中尼所报道的
    “上海不法厂商的忘恩负义行为”，那还只是万中检一的典型。像中国化学工业社接受肥皂、香皂的定货，虚报油脂香料成本，骗取暴利十亿余元。大中金属材料厂纠合同业抗拒华东工业部的加工任务，又纠合同业对市工商局抬高工缴费，强调损耗率，暴利四十余亿元。糖商程顺康假借美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、霸占台湾的紧张时局，操纵市场，哄抬糖价，攫取暴利。大中华电器材料行负责人绰号“钨丝大王”的奸商夏盈奎，操纵钨丝市场，暴利数十倍。制纸业公会负责人为抗美援朝捐献一亿元，得到表扬，上了镜头，拍了电影，而民丰、华丰两造纸公司却偷税漏税一百一十八亿余元。像永祥华行老板陈国珍那一套腐蚀国家工作干部的方法，陪嫖伴赌，送贿赂，小老婆招待。这说明资产阶级为了赚钱，为了暴利，什么无耻不要脸的手段都用得出来。还有更令人不能容忍的，大康药房经理王康年，以假药次货盗骗中国人民志愿军部队采购药物的巨款，影响我们英勇的志愿军战士的健康。上海奸商真是丧尽了天良！上海的反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动刚才开始，大大小小的“老虎”可能成千论万，还待捕捉。上海工商界还有隐瞒敌产的案子在检举中，内容可能是惊人的。至于工商界知名之士利用国家经济情报以操纵物价获取暴利的，已成社会谈资。也有民主人士介绍子弟进政府机关工作，搞经济情报，做生意。总之，上海商人的花样多得很，“大老虎”也多得很。侵吞国家财富达一亿元者就是大贪污犯，这在上海普通得很。打虎的阵势摆开了，剿尽大大小小的“老虎”，尤其莫叫“大老虎”漏网！
    资产阶级就是这样的贪婪无耻！上海不法厂商尤其忘恩负义！
    资产阶级思想想占上风
    上海工商界是拥护毛主席的“公私兼顾”“劳资两利”的经济政策的；但表现出来的不是完全拥护，而是有条件的拥护，不是全面的拥护，而是片面的拥护。正如许涤新局长所说：他们是撇开了国营经济的领导，把“公私兼顾”了解成“分庭抗礼”，“平分秋色”；他们是取消了工人阶级的领导来谈“劳资两利”的。有困难时就“公私兼顾”一番，情况好转时就“顾私不顾公”。据我的接触体会，上海工商界不仅不甘心接受工人阶级的领导，还想把资产阶级的思想占上风。资产阶级的思想基本是唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧，此外还有多方面的表现。自从上海解放以来，资产阶级思想的第一个表现是“是非不分”。上海刚一解放，银元贩“敲大头”，哄物价，沸反盈天；擒贼先擒王，军管会查抄了证券大楼，捕捉了勾结帝国主义和蒋匪帮操纵银元贩以扰乱金融物价的“大老虎”，工商界民主人士就向政府来说情求饶。资产阶级思想的第二个表现是“敌我不分”，以至“借敌利己”。工商界人士大规模地隐瞒敌产以为己有，就是一个例子。资产阶级思想的第三个表现是“公私不分”，以至“假公济私”。这如同利用个人的政治地位，盗窃国家情报，是明显的例证。资产阶级思想的第四个表现，就是“分庭抗礼”，以至想“占上风”。例如瑞有天茶食糖果店劳资纠纷事件，该店资方陈森是那样的刁钻古怪，以对付敌人的手段对付职工，小题大做，扩大纠纷。纠纷延续半年以上，最后开扩大市协商委员会，兴师动众，会议开了八个半钟头，才算了结。市店员工会表现了工人阶级忠厚宽大的气质，发表了公开检讨书。在另一次市协商委员会上，工商联领导人厉声责斥上海各报不该在发表新闻中批评瑞有天的资方，要求各报做公开检讨。会后我向负责首长说：瑞有天事件的迁延扩大，店员工会和工商联的领导皆有责任，店员工会做了公开检讨，工商联也应该做公开检讨。各报无错，无可检讨；工商联有责，却不检讨。那次事件是资产阶级思想占了上风。由此发展下去，资产阶级思想就要在新民主主义的体系中争取领导的地位了。一个具体的例子，就是在市府委员会的会议席上，工商联领导人要求修改陈毅市长对上海市二届三次代表会议的开会词，因为开会词中有这样几句话：“必须坚决地确立以无产阶级的思想为唯一的领导力量，批判一切资产阶级与小资产阶级错误的思想，不允许任何反动思想来损害人民革命与人民民主事业。”说是经过工商界代表们的讨论，一致认为民族资产阶级既然是四大民主阶级之一，为什么说他们的思想是错误的以至反动的呢？并且提出了拟好了的修改文字。这个违反原则的提议当然通不过。会后，有人认为那次会议上出现了阶级斗争。这不能不说是资产阶级思想想争取“分庭抗礼”以至“占上风”吧！
    今天是工人阶级向资产阶级反攻
    是我们“制造阶级斗争”吗？这答案是否定的，事实证明，是资产阶级向着工人阶级和中国共产党举行了猖狂进攻的阶级斗争；今天全国人民在毛主席的伟大领导之下开展反贪污反行贿的斗争，乃是工人阶级向资产阶级反攻。事情严重到今天的程度，如果工人阶级再不反攻，让资产阶级的猖狂进攻更猖狂地发展下去，我们国家人民的利益就不能保，抗美援朝的胜利就不能保，国家建设到社会主义的前途就不能保，帝国主义的侵略就更猖狂，世界和平也不能保。情势如此，义无反顾，全中国人民，尤其是国家政权领导阶级的工人弟兄们，要一致接受毛主席的伟大号召，坚决击退资产阶级的猖狂进攻！这是一场保护国家人民利益、保障抗美援朝胜利、保证社会主义前途、保卫世界和平的伟大爱国斗争，英勇前进，誓争全胜！在这场伟大的爱国斗争中，是不是就要消灭民族资产阶级呢？是不是就要把民族资产阶级驱逐出人民民主统一战线呢？不是的！我们的斗争，是要捕捉侵吞国家财富的“大老虎”，是要击退资产阶级对人民政权的猖狂进攻，是要争取改造民族资产阶级唯利是图、损人利己、投机取巧的那一面黑暗腐朽的思想本质。所以这一斗争的胜利结果，不仅是国家人民的利益，也是民族资产阶级的利益。这一斗争的胜利结果的另一面，是中国民族资产阶级获得改造，我们的人民民主统一战线就更加巩固。所以这斗争，还是为了团结，为了更巩固我们的人民民主统一战线。爱国的民族资本家，正当的工商界人士，大家站稳人民的立场，站稳遵守共同纲领的立场，接受毛主席的伟大号召，在工人阶级领导之下，和全国人民一道，共同投入反贪污反行贿的伟大爱国战斗，检举不法商人，帮助落后商人进步，由此整顿工商界的队伍，取得民族资产阶级的改造和进步。（原载二月九日上海大公报）
