    We at the Front Received 慰问品 from the People of the Motherland
    Comrade Editor: New Year's Eve was a snowy night. The soldiers were holding fast to their positions when they suddenly received 慰问品 sent by the people of the motherland. Seeing these 慰问品, everyone was immediately invigorated, because every item was intertwined with the love of the people of the motherland for us. Many comrades cherished and kept the items allocated to them. We know that the support of the people of the motherland is the source of our strength. Everyone expressed their determination: to vow to annihilate more enemies to repay the care and love of the people of the motherland for us. Finally, we jointly proposed: "The position is our home, and the front line is the frontier of the motherland. Defending the position is defending our home."

    我们在前线接到了祖国人民的慰问品
    编辑同志：新年除夕，是一个雪后的夜晚。战士们正扼守在阵地上，忽然接到了祖国人民送来的慰问物品。大家看到这些慰问品，立刻振奋起来，因为每件东西上都交织着祖国人民对我们的热爱。许多同志都把分配给自己的物品，珍惜地保存在身边。我们知道祖国人民的支援，是我们力量的源泉。大家纷纷表示决心：誓以多歼灭敌人来回答祖国人民对自己的关怀和爱戴。最后，我们共同提出：“阵地就是家乡，前沿就是祖国的边疆。守住阵地，就是保卫家乡。”
