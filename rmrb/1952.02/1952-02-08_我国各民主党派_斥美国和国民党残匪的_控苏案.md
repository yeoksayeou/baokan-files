Our Various Democratic Parties
Denounce the U.S. and the Kuomintang Remnants' "Accusation Against the Soviet Union"

[This newspaper reports] The U.S. imperialists, at the instigation of the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan, have for the third time brought up the so-called "Accusation Against the Soviet Union," a slander against the Soviet Union and our country, in the United Nations, once again exposing the shameless conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists to antagonize the people of our country and the Soviet Union and to deliberately endanger world peace. To this end, the responsible persons and spokesmen of various democratic parties in our country have successively issued statements, denouncing this shameful and criminal conspiracy played by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in the United Nations General Assembly.

Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "The U.S. imperialists' military aggression against China and Korea has been beaten bloody on the Korean battlefield, but it has not yet learned enough lessons, and still dreams of forming a military aggression encirclement against China starting from Japan, passing through Taiwan, which it has occupied as our territory, as well as the Philippines and parts of the Southeast Asian continent. It illegally concluded a separate peace with the reactionary Yoshida government of Japan and rearmed Japan; not long ago, it instigated the Yoshida government and the Kuomintang remnant bandit group to ‘conclude peace’ and is funding and directing the activities of Li Mi's troops of the Kuomintang remnants who fled to the Burmese border. The main purpose of it playing the puppet farce of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which has been expelled by the Chinese people and ridiculed by the people of the world, for the third time in the United Nations General Assembly is to try to cover up its new military aggression conspiracy. The great strength of the Chinese people who have won glorious victories and the Soviet people who have a solid alliance is enough to defeat any aggressor. If the despicable and shameful small group of remnant bandits in Taiwan dare to take a chance, they will prove to be expediting their own destruction."

The spokesman of the Headquarters of the China Democratic League stated: "We believe that this illegal action of the United States in the United Nations General Assembly is inseparable from a series of its recent aggression conspiracies in Japan and Southeast Asia. The U.S. imperialists have not learned their lesson from the heavy defeat suffered in launching the war of aggression in Korea, and it attempts to continue to invade China and Southeast Asia, preparing to expand the war of aggression on the Asian continent. The purpose of raising the so-called ‘Accusation Against the Soviet Union’ this time is to attempt to alienate the unity and friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union and to create an excuse for it to carry out aggression on our southwestern border. We call on the peace-loving people of all countries in Asia to unite and oppose this shameful and criminal conspiracy of U.S. imperialism. At the same time, we must warn the U.S. government that if it dares to continue to support the Kuomintang remnants in invading our territory, the U.S. government will be responsible for all the consequences and responsibilities."

The spokesman of the China Democratic National Construction Association stated: "The U.S. imperialists and the Chiang bandit gang are playing the so-called ‘Accusation Against the Soviet Union’ farce in the United Nations General Assembly. It is very obvious that they are attempting to use the smoke screen of slandering the Soviet Union as ‘invading China’ in order to carry out their conspiracy to invade China. The Soviet Union’s consistent assistance to the Chinese people, especially the great assistance in the two years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, is deeply appreciated by the Chinese people. The facts of the past two years, especially the facts of the past year and more since resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, fully prove that the close unity of the 700 million people of China and the Soviet Union is a strong guarantee of peace in the Far East and a guarantee of world peace. The cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union will surely defeat any imperialist offensive."

Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: "This absurd and shameless slander by the U.S. imperialists and the Kuomintang remnants is certainly not worth refuting, but we, the people of the whole country, cannot but pay serious attention to and be fully vigilant about the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to invade China contained in this despicable slander. Facts have proved that the U.S. imperialists have recently openly instructed the Kuomintang remnants to collude with the Japanese Yoshida government and actively funded and directed the activities of the Li Mi troops of the Kuomintang remnants on the Sino-Burmese border. This sinful intention has aroused the common anger and condemnation of the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of Asian countries. We will never tolerate this sinful intention and aggressive deployment of the U.S. aggressors. Every member of our China Association for Promoting Democracy vows to unite with the people of the whole country under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China to fight together to stop the new military activities of U.S. imperialism in Asia."

The spokesman of the China Zhi Gong Party stated: "The people of our country are familiar with this cunning and despicable behavior of the imperialist bloc. In addition to paying close attention to every attempt of U.S. imperialism with sufficient vigilance, we must also make every effort to smash any of its aggressive actions. At the same time, we must warn the U.S. imperialists and their accomplices that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people cannot be alienated by anyone or any conspiracy. We are determined to wage a resolute struggle against the imperialists under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, and to smash any attempt by the imperialists to attack us."

Xu Deheng, Chairman of the Jiusan Society, published an article entitled "Lies Cannot Cover Up the Facts," saying: "This bankrupt lie of U.S. imperialism cannot cover up its serious political and moral failure. As early as September 1949, the U.S. imperialists instructed the Kuomintang remnant representatives to raise the fabricated ‘Accusation Against the Soviet Union’ at the Fourth United Nations General Assembly, which was immediately ridiculed by the people of the world and sternly refuted by the Soviet representatives. In September 1950, the Kuomintang representatives again put this proposal on the agenda of the Fifth United Nations General Assembly, but even some of the main servant countries of the United States expressed opposition, and thus it was shelved. Now, after being beaten bloody on the Korean battlefield, the United States does not know how to examine itself and妄想to further antagonize the Chinese people and the Asian people. It can be asserted that it will suffer an even more惨重serious defeat. The fourteenth of this month is the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. I call on all members of the Jiusan Society to contact the vast number of people in the cultural, educational and scientific circles to strengthen the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union, consolidate Asian and world peace, and defeat all the aggressive conspiracies of U.S. imperialism."

    我国各民主党派
    斥美国和国民党残匪的“控苏案”
    【本报讯】美帝国主义指使台湾国民党残匪在联合国中第三次提出诽谤苏联和我国的所谓“控苏案”，再一次暴露美帝国主义敌视我国和苏联人民、蓄意危害世界和平的无耻阴谋。为此，我国各民主党派负责人和发言人相继发表谈话，痛斥美蒋匪帮在联合国大会中玩弄的这种可耻的罪恶阴谋。
    中国国民党革命委员会李济深主席发表谈话说：“美帝国主义者对中国和朝鲜的军事侵略，已在朝鲜战场上被打得头破血流，但它还没有得到足够的教训，还妄想着从日本起，经过所侵占我国的领土台湾以及菲律宾和东南亚大陆的若干部分组成对中国的军事侵略包围圈。它非法地与日本反动统治吉田政府单独媾和，重新武装日本；不久以前又嗾使吉田政府和国民党残匪集团‘媾和’，并正在资助与指挥逃窜缅甸边境的国民党残匪的李弥部队活动。它之所以在联合国大会第三次玩弄为中国人民所驱逐和全世界人民所耻笑的蒋介石匪帮的傀儡丑剧，其主要目的，就是企图掩饰它的新军事侵略阴谋。获得光荣胜利的中国人民和订有坚固同盟的苏联人民的伟大力量是足够击败任何侵略者的，卑鄙可耻的台湾一小撮残余匪帮如果敢来冒险一试，就会叫它自己证明是自速其亡。”
    中国民主同盟总部发言人发表谈话说：“我们认为这次美国在联合国大会的非法举动，和它最近在日本及在东南亚所进行的一系列的侵略阴谋是分不开的。美帝国主义并没有因为在朝鲜发动侵略战争遭受惨重失败，得到教训，它企图继续侵略中国和东南亚，准备在亚洲大陆上扩大侵略战争。这次所谓‘控苏案’的提出，其目的就是妄想离间我中苏两国人民的团结友谊，并为它在我西南边境进行侵略制造藉口。我们号召全亚洲各国爱好和平的人民，一致起来反对美帝国主义这种可耻的罪恶的阴谋。同时我们更要警告美国政府，如果它敢于继续支持国民党残匪侵略我们的国土，其一切后果和责任将由美国政府自负。”
    民主建国会发言人发表谈话说：“美帝国主义在联合国大会和蒋匪帮扮演所谓‘控苏案’丑剧，十分明显，是企图利用诬蔑苏联为‘侵略中国’的烟幕，以遂行其侵略中国的阴谋。苏联一贯地对于中国人民的援助，尤其是签订了中苏友好同盟互助条约以后两年来的伟大援助，是中国人民深深感激的。两年来的事实，尤其是抗美援朝以后一年多来的事实充分证明，中苏两大国七万万人民的紧密团结，是远东和平的坚强保障，是世界和平的保障。中苏两国人民的合作，一定可以击溃任何帝国主义的进攻。”
    中国民主促进会主席马叙伦发表谈话说：“美帝国主义和国民党残匪这种荒诞无耻的诽谤，固然不值一驳，但在这个卑劣的谰言中所包含的美帝国主义对中国侵略的阴谋，我们全国人民却不能不加以严重的注意和充分的警惕。事实证明美帝国主义最近已公然指使国民党残匪与日本吉田政府勾结，积极资助和指挥了中缅边界国民党残匪李弥部队的活动，这种罪恶用心，已引起我中国人民和亚洲各国爱好和平人民的共同愤怒和斥责。我们决不能容忍美国侵略者的这种罪恶用心和侵略布置。我们中国民主促进会的每一会员，誓在毛主席和中国共产党的领导之下，与全国人民团结一致，为共同制止美帝国主义在亚洲的新的军事活动而斗争。”
    中国致公党发言人发表谈话说：“我国人民对于帝国主义集团这种狡诈、卑劣的行为，是熟知的。我们除了以十分的警觉来注意美国帝国主义的每一企图外，并要以一切努力来粉碎它的任何侵略行动。同时，我们还得警告美国帝国主义者和它的帮凶们，中国人民和苏联人民之间的友谊，是任何人或任何阴谋所不能离间的。我们决心在中央人民政府和毛主席的领导之下与帝国主义者作坚决斗争，粉碎帝国主义向我们进攻的任何企图。”
    九三学社主席许德珩以“谎言掩盖不了事实”为题发表谈话说：“美帝国主义这种早已破产了的谎言并不能掩盖它在政治上和道义上的严重失败。早在一九四九年九月，美帝国主义就指使国民党残匪代表在第四届联合国大会提出所捏造的‘控苏案’，当时立即受到全世界人民的嘲笑和苏联代表的严词驳斥。一九五○年九月，国民党代表又把这项提案提到第五届联大的议程上来，但连美国的一些主要仆从国家也表示反对，因而搁浅起来。现在美国在朝鲜战场上被打得头破血流之余，竟不自知检点，妄想进一步与中国人民和亚洲人民为敌，可以断言，它将遭受到更惨重的失败。本月十四日是中苏友好同盟互助条约签订二周年的日子，我号召九三学社的全体社员联系广大的文教科学界人士，为加强中苏两国伟大的友谊，巩固亚洲及世界和平，打败美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋而共同奋斗。”
