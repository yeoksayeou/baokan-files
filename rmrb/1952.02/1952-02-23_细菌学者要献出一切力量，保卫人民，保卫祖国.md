    Bacteriologists Must Devote All Their Strength to Defend the People and Defend the Motherland
    Tang Feifan, Director of the Biological Products Research Institute of the Central Ministry of Health

    American warmongers have completely lost their humanity. After suffering a fatal blow in their invasion of Korea, they hypocritically held armistice talks with us, while intensifying their attacks against us. Now, they have fully exposed their hideous faces and adopted extremely barbaric means by employing bacteriological warfare in Korea. Bacteriological warfare has long been prohibited by the Versailles Treaty, and the International Society for Microbiology and the Bacteriological Society also issued a telegram against it in 1942. This is a well-known fact. The barbaric act of destroying human civilization and exterminating humanity is unanimously opposed by people all over the world, including the American people. The American imperialists are also one of the signatories to the Versailles Treaty, but now they disregard the just condemnation of the people of the world and use bacteriological warfare, which further proves their madness and shamelessness. It also demonstrates that they have reached the end of their rope and are making a last-ditch struggle.

    Bacteriological warfare, like atomic warfare, cannot determine the outcome of a war. The German and Japanese fascist bandits previously engaged in bacteriological warfare and suffered shameful defeats, eventually receiving just trials. The American bandits, inheriting the mantle of the German and Japanese fascists, will ultimately not escape this fate either. We scientific workers, especially bacteriologists, must unite closely, dedicate all our strength, study defense methods, and protect the people of our motherland. We have the confidence to complete the sacred task given to us by the people of our motherland.

    American imperialism and the scientists who have become its slaves have become the common enemies of all mankind. They must bear full responsibility for all the evils caused by bacteriological warfare and will certainly be subject to the just sanctions of the people of the world in the future.

    细菌学者要献出一切力量，保卫人民，保卫祖国
    中央卫生部生物制品研究所所长  汤飞凡
    美国战争贩子已完全灭绝了人性。它在侵略朝鲜遭到致命打击后一面假意和我们举行停战谈判，一面却更加紧对我们进攻，现在更完全暴露了它的狰狞面目，采取极端野蛮的手段，在朝鲜使用细菌战术了。细菌战早已为凡尔塞公约所禁止，一九四二年国际微生物学会及细菌学会也曾通电反对。这是尽人皆知的事实。破坏人类文明，灭绝人道的野蛮行为，是全世界人民连美国人民在内所一致反对的。美帝国主义也是凡尔塞公约签字国之一，现在竟然不顾全世界人民正义的指摘，使用细菌战术，更加证明了它的疯狂和无耻，也正表现了它已走到穷途末路，在作垂死挣扎。
    细菌战和原子战一样，是不能决定战争胜负的，德、日法西斯强盗以前都曾进行过细菌战，都遭到了可耻的失败，最后受到了正义的裁判。美国强盗继承德、日法西斯的衣钵，最后也难逃这个命运。我们科学工作者，特别是细菌学者们，要紧紧团结起来，献出一切力量，研究防御办法，保卫祖国人民。我们有信心完成祖国人民所给予我们的神圣任务。
    美帝国主义和沦为它的奴才的科学家们已经成为全人类的公敌，他们要对细菌战所引起的一切恶果负完全责任，将来必定要受到全世界人民正义的制裁。
