The Cuban People's Struggle for Peace, Independence, and Liberation
    —Report at the Welcome Meeting of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs on February 7, 1952
    Cuban Poet Nicolás Guillén

    I am very honored to visit China. It is not easy to visit China from Cuba. One must travel through Canada, Scotland, the Netherlands, France, Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and Siberia to reach Beijing. Despite such a long journey, I still feel this visit is a privilege because it allows me to have practical contact with Chinese society, which enriches my political experience.

    There are over 50,000 overseas Chinese in Cuba, and they participated in the Cuban War of Independence. Therefore, the Cuban people are very concerned about everything that happens in China. Just as I am here to introduce the situation in Cuba to the Chinese people, when I return, I will convey everything I have seen here to the Cuban people and the overseas Chinese in Cuba.

    Now, I would like to give a brief introduction to the geographical situation of Cuba, which may be beneficial. Cuba is a large island in the Antilles, with an area of 114,000 square kilometers and a population of 5.5 million. Black and white people live together, and the indigenous people have been gradually displaced since the Spanish discovered the island. In the mixed composition of various ethnic groups in Cuba, the mixed-race of Chinese and blacks occupies an important component.

    The Cuban people have persistently struggled for the freedom and independence of their motherland. This revolutionary struggle against Spanish rule can be divided into two main stages:

    (1) The first stage was the War of Independence from 1868 to 1878. In this war, the people failed due to lack of combat experience and internal divisions.

    (2) The second stage was the War of Independence from 1895 to 1898. U.S. imperialism participated in this war against Spain in 1898 to expand U.S. aggression in Cuba. As a result, although the Spanish rulers were driven away, they were replaced by an American ruler.

    Before leaving Cuba in 1902, U.S. imperialism created a republic. The constitution of this republic stipulated that the port of Guantánamo in Cuba be ceded to the United States as a coastal base, and it also stated that the United States had the right to intervene if political unrest occurred in Cuba. This unreasonable privilege is the famous Platt Amendment.

    From this time on, the forces of U.S. imperialism massively invaded various economic sectors of Cuba. American capital bought up Cuban land, and Americans became the monopolists of Cuba's main industry—sugar production. Cuba's own sugar production, except for sales to the United States, could not be freely exported to other countries. Therefore, the price of sugar was completely controlled by the United States. U.S. imperialism used this method of controlling Cuba's economic lifeline to effectively control Cuba's political power, and all Cuban governments became tools of U.S. imperialism.

    Along with economic aggression, U.S. imperialism also carried out cultural aggression in our country. The executors of this policy were the American cultural commissioners, who were American spies disguised as poets or journalists. The task of these cultural commissioners was to conduct propaganda to targets selected by the United States. The propaganda materials they used were pamphlets against the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries. The cultural commissioners were the ones who decided who could be allowed to go to the United States or who could not. Cubans who were not allowed to go to the United States were: (1) Communists, (2) friends of the Communists, (3) soldiers who participated in the Spanish Civil War against Franco, (4) people who participated in the peace movement, (5) people who signed in support of peace, (6) all people with progressive ideas. The U.S. government used this method to coerce intellectuals who wanted to go to the United States. For people whose political attitudes were already clear, the American police used even more violent methods. For example, in 1949, when I and the chairman of our Cuban Communist Party, Marinello, went to Paris to attend the First World Congress for the Defense of Peace and passed through the United States, we were imprisoned on Ellis Island for two days and only escorted onto the plane by the police when it was about to take off.

    In 1925, the Cuban Communist Party (Cuban People's Socialist Party) was established. It spread the truth to the people, exposing that the United States' expulsion of Spain was only to further rule Cuba, not for the Cuban people. Thus, the deceptive and misleading policies of U.S. imperialism were exposed. The Cuban Communist Party continued the struggle for independence, striving to realize a truly free and democratic republic. It promoted the unity of the working class and widely carried out Marxist-Leninist propaganda and education among the masses.

    From 1928 to 1933, the Cuban people launched a surging revolutionary movement against the Machado dictatorship. In this movement, although the Communist Party was still considered illegal, it was already in a leading position. It bravely led the Cuban general strike in 1933, overthrew the Machado regime, and gained the status of a legal party in 1938. This struggle awakened the Cuban people, promoted the constitutional assembly, amended the so-called constitution made for the United States, and formulated a more progressive new constitution in 1940. This new constitution stipulated women's right to vote, workers' right to strike and retire, and abolished racial discrimination, etc.

    We must not forget that Havana is only a fifty-minute flight away from the South where the American black problem is most acute. The phenomenon of racial discrimination in Cuba was spread under the instigation of the Americans. The Communist Party is the only party that opposes such racial discrimination, and it strives in Congress for equal status for blacks and whites.

    While carrying out the struggle for independence, the Communist Party also worked hard to unify and unite the working class, and established the Cuban National Federation of Labor in 1938. Under the direct leadership of the great leader Lázaro Peña, this union united more than 500,000 workers. Although the government has now declared this union illegal and created a government union, the Cuban General Confederation of Labor still maintains its prestige among workers. The General Confederation of Labor firmly opposes the traditional system of exploiting workers. This exploitation is particularly rampant in the sugar industry. The National Sugar Workers Union led the workers in a tenacious struggle against the exploiters and achieved initial victories in increasing wages. The first leader of the Sugar Workers Union, Jesús Menéndez, was a black man and also a member of Congress. When he was campaigning throughout the country in 1948, he was murdered by Captain Casillas, a Cuban army officer under the direction of the United States.

    Currently, the so-called Cuban revolutionary government, with Prío Socarrás as president, is actually a puppet attached to the Washington government. We can say that this government is the most corrupt government since the establishment of the Cuban Republic. The officials of the Socarrás government all came to power with empty sleeves, but after four years in office, they have all become millionaires. Some have even bought private planes, precious jade antiques, etc. with the blood and sweat they have plundered from the people, while the people's lives are becoming increasingly impoverished.

    Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the Cuban government is doing its best to suppress the Communist Party and the peace movement. In 1950, the government banned the Communist Party's newspaper "Hoy." It sent a group of policemen to close down the newspaper office by barbaric means. "Hoy" was the people's most beloved newspaper because it was founded by the people themselves who raised 150,000 U.S. dollars. After the newspaper office was closed, a lawsuit was filed in court. Although the government was forced to lift the ban, it drove a group of American-style hooligans to destroy the printing machines of the newspaper office. However, the newspaper office did not succumb. The next day, the newspaper was republished as usual with fewer pages under difficult circumstances.

    The peace movement is also a movement for national independence for Cuba. Therefore, despite police persecution and various obstacles, the Cuban peace movement is still developing in depth. Up to now, in this country with a population of 5.5 million, 850,000 people have signed the declaration in support of the conclusion of a Five-Power Peace Pact. The signature campaign is regarded as illegal in Cuba, and the government often uses the excuse of conspiracy to subvert the regime to arrest and imprison those who collect signatures. At the same time, all people who return from the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries will be immediately detained at the airport and sent to prison with some shameless fabrications. However, the people have clearly realized that the world peace movement is the movement for Cuba's freedom and independence. If war breaks out, the entire territory of Cuba will become an American military base, all progressive activities will be prohibited, all industries will serve U.S. imperialism, and Cuba will forever be reduced to a colony of U.S. imperialism.

    Here I would like to tell you a story to illustrate how arrogant the Americans are in Cuba. In 1949, an American ship arrived in Havana, the capital of Cuba. The American sailors went ashore to play in Central Park. They climbed onto the monument of José Martí, the leader of the Cuban nation (the leader of the Second Revolutionary War, as well as a writer, poet, and orator), and urinated on Martí's head. This insult to the Cuban national leader aroused extreme anger among the Cuban people. The people organized a large mass demonstration, parading in front of the U.S. embassy and throwing stones. The next day, the American ambassador had to feign sincerity and offer a bouquet of flowers to the monument. The Cuban people saw from this incident that when we are still called a republic, the Americans are already so unscrupulous. If Cuba becomes an American base, then they will be even more reckless. Similar things will happen every day.

    Due to the people's awareness, the Cuban peace movement has become a broad mass movement. The Cuban National Committee for the Defense of Peace includes representatives from all walks of life, such as workers, youth, students, professors, women, and blacks. The chairman of the Peace Committee is Dr. Elías Entralgo, a professor of history at the University of Havana.

    Like the Chinese people, the Cuban people are waging a resolute struggle against the economic and political aggression of U.S. imperialism. They want to strive to sell their products not only to the United States, but also to be able to freely sell them to the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries.

    Last year, the commander-in-chief of the Cuban army, General Cabellera, was summoned to Washington for instructions. After he returned, President Socarrás asked Congress to send troops to Korea to participate in the war of aggression. This incident aroused fierce opposition from the people. There were large mass rallies in universities, middle schools, and streets to oppose the government's treasonous conspiracy. Under the strong pressure of the people, Cuba did not send any soldiers to Korea. This is a great victory for the Cuban people. This also proves that the Korean people's just war against imperialist aggression has received the warm sympathy of the Cuban people. Because both countries are countries that have been invaded.

    Our international struggle and domestic struggle are closely linked. Under the leadership of its chairman, Juan Marinello, and its general secretary, Blas Roca, the Cuban Communist Party is constantly working to establish a broad national united front to unite all parties that oppose the government to actively participate in the general election on February 1, 1952. We must not only strive for the victory of the general election, but also establish a peace-loving, independent, and honest government, a government that opposes bureaucracy and waste. We must learn from China under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong to forever get rid of the shackles of U.S. imperialism.

    Now, on behalf of the Cuban people, I shout: Long live the Chinese people! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the wise leader of the Chinese people!

    On behalf of the Cuban Committee for the Defense of Peace, I shout: Long live the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace and Opposition to American Aggression!

    On behalf of the Cuban Communist Party, I shout: Long live the glorious Communist Party of China, the banner of freedom, democracy, and peace! (Translated by Dong Ningchuan)

    古巴人民争取和平与独立解放的斗争
    ——一九五二年二月七日在中国人民外交学会欢迎会上的报告
    古巴诗人  尼古拉·吉里安
    我能来中国访问，感到非常荣幸。从古巴来访问中国不是一件容易的事，要经过加拿大、苏格兰、荷兰、法国、捷克斯洛伐克、苏联、蒙古和西伯利亚才能到北京。虽然是这样长的旅行，我仍觉得这次访问对我是一种特权，因为能和中国社会实际接触，这就丰富了我的政治经验。
    古巴有五万多华侨，他们参加过古巴的独立战争，因此古巴人民对中国所发生的一切事情都非常关心。正像我在这里要把古巴的情况介绍给中国人民一样，我回去的时候，也要把在这里所看到的一切传达给古巴人民和在古巴的华侨。
    现在我想先把古巴的地理情况，作一个简略的介绍，这也许是有益的。古巴是安的列斯群岛中的一个大岛，面积十一万四千方公里，人口五百五十万，黑人和白人杂居在一起，土著人自西班牙人发现该岛后就慢慢被驱散了。在古巴各族人民的混合成份里面，中国人和黑人的混血占着一个重要的成份。
    古巴人民坚持不渝地为祖国的自由和独立而斗争，这个反对西班牙统治的革命斗争可以分为两个主要的阶段：
    （一）第一个阶段是一八六八年至一八七八年的独立战争。在这次战争中，人民因为缺乏斗争经验和内部的分裂而失败了。
    （二）第二个阶段是一八九五年至一八九八年的独立战争。美帝国主义在一八九八年参加了这次反对西班牙的战争，来扩张美国在古巴的侵略势力，结果西班牙统治者虽被驱走，却换来了一个美国统治者。
    美帝国主义于一九○二年离开古巴之前，制造了一个共和国，这个共和国的宪法上规定着把古巴的凯马湼拉港让给美国作为海岸基地，并注明如果古巴发生政治暴动时，美国有权进行干涉。这种无理的特权，就是有名的普拉特修正案。
    从这个时候起，美帝国主义的势力就大规模地侵入了古巴的各个经济部门。美国资本收买了古巴的土地，美国人变成古巴的主要工业——制糖工业的独占者。古巴自己的糖产，除了卖给美国外，不能自由地向别国输出，因此糖的价格就完全受美国的操纵。美帝国主义就利用这种左右古巴经济命脉的方式，实际上掌握了古巴的政权，所有的古巴政府都成了美帝国主义的工具。
    在经济侵略的同时，美帝国主义还在我国进行着文化的侵略。执行这种政策的就是美国的文化专员，这都是穿着诗人或新闻记者外衣的美国间谍。这些文化专员的任务就是向美国所选择的对象进行宣传。他们所用的宣传品都是一些反对苏联、中国和人民民主国家的小册子。文化专员就是决定谁能被允许去美国或谁不能去的人。不能到美国去的古巴人是：（一）共产党员，（二）共产党的朋友，（三）参加反对佛朗哥的西班牙内战的战士，（四）参加和平运动的人，（五）签名拥护和平的人，（六）一切有进步思想的人士。美国政府并利用这种手段来威逼想去美国的知识分子。对于政治态度已经明确的人，美国警察就使用更强暴的手段。譬如，一九四九年我和我国共产党主席马里奈洛到巴黎去参加第一届世界保卫和平大会经过美国时，就在爱里斯岛上被囚禁了两天，直到飞机开行时才由警察押上飞机。
    　一九二五年，古巴共产党（古巴人民社会党）成立了。它向人民传布真理，揭露美国驱逐西班牙只是为了进一步统治古巴，而不是为了古巴人民，于是美帝国主义的欺骗蒙蔽政策被戳穿了。古巴共产党继续着争取独立的斗争，为实现一个真正的自由民主的共和国而努力。它促成了工人队伍的统一，并在群众中广泛地进行马克思列宁主义的宣传教育。
    一九二八年至一九三三年，古巴人民反对马查多独裁政权，掀起了澎湃的革命运动。在这次运动中，共产党虽还是被认为非法，但已居于领导地位了。它勇敢地领导了一九三三年的古巴总罢工，推翻了马查多政权，并于一九三八年获得了合法政党的地位。这斗争唤醒了古巴人民，促成了立宪议会，修改了为美国制造的所谓宪法，并于一九四○年制订了比较进步的新宪法。这个新宪法规定了妇女的选举权，工人的罢工权、退休权，并取缔了种族的歧视等。
    我们不要忘记，哈瓦那离美国黑人问题最尖锐的南方仅五十分钟的飞行程途。古巴种族歧视的现象就是在美国人的教唆下散布的。共产党是反对这样种族歧视的唯一的政党，它在国会里极力争取黑人与白人的平等地位。
    在进行独立斗争的时候，共产党也努力于工人阶级的统一和团结的工作，并于一九三八年成立了古巴全国总工会。在伟大的领袖拉萨罗·贝尼亚的直接领导下，这个工会团结了五十万以上的工人。现在政府虽然宣布这个工会为非法，并制造了一个政府的工会，但是古巴总工会仍然在工人中保持着威信。总工会坚决反对传统的剥削工人的制度。这种剥削在糖业方面特别凶狠。全国糖业工人工会领导工人与剥削者进行了顽强的斗争，并在增加工资方面获得了初步的胜利。糖业工会的第一个领袖耶稣·曼湼台斯是一个黑人，也是国会议员。当他于一九四八年在全国进行宣传时，就被一个美国指使下的古巴陆军上尉卡西拉斯杀害了。
    目前，以布里奥·苏加拉斯为总统的所谓的古巴革命政府，实际上是依附于华盛顿政府的傀儡。我们可以说这个政府是古巴共和国成立以来最腐败的一个政府。苏加拉斯政府的官员们都是两袖清风地上台的，而执政四年之后，他们都变成了百万富翁。有的人更把从人民身上搜刮来的血汗钱，买了私人飞机、珍贵的玉器古玩等……，而人民的生活则日益穷困。
    在美帝国主义的指使下，古巴政府极力压制共产党与和平运动。一九五○年，政府禁止了共产党机关报“今日”，它派了一批警察，用野蛮的手段封闭了报馆。“今日”是人民最爱戴的报纸，因为它是人民自己捐集了十五万元美金创办起来的。报馆被封后就向法院提出控诉，政府虽被迫开禁，却又驱使一批美国式的流氓，把报馆的印刷机器等捣毁了。但是报馆并没有屈服，第二天报纸又以较少的篇幅，在困难的情况下，照常复刊。
    和平运动对于古巴也是一个民族独立的运动。因此，虽有警察的迫害和种种障碍，古巴的和平运动仍然在深入发展。截至目前为止，在这个五百五十万人口的国家里，已有八十五万人在拥护缔结五大国和平公约的宣言上签了名。签名运动在古巴是被视为非法的，政府常常用阴谋推翻政权的藉口，把征集签名的人逮捕下狱。同时，所有由苏联、中国和人民民主国家回去的人们，都会在飞机场上立即被扣，以一些无耻的捏造口实送入监牢。但是，人民已经清楚地认识了世界和平运动就是古巴的自由独立的运动。如果战争爆发，古巴的整个领土都要变成美国的军事基地，一切的进步活动都要被禁止，一切的工业都要为美帝国主义服务，古巴将永远沦为美帝国主义的殖民地。
    这里我想向诸位介绍一个故事，说明美国人在古巴是如何地狂妄。一九四九年，一只美国船开到了古巴首都哈瓦那。美国的海员们下船到中央公园去玩，他们爬上了古巴民族领袖何塞·马尔迪（第二次革命战争的领袖，同时也是作家、诗人和演说家）的纪念碑，并在马尔迪的头上洒尿。对古巴民族领袖的这种侮辱激起了古巴人民的极度愤怒，人民就组织了广大的群众示威运动，在美国公使馆前浩荡游行，并投掷石子。第二天，美国公使只好假惺惺地去到纪念碑前献了一束鲜花。古巴人民从这件事里看出，当我们还被称做共和国的时候，美国人已经这样肆无忌惮。假如古巴成了美国基地，那末他们更要为所欲为。类似的事情每天将层出不穷地发生。
    由于人民的觉悟，古巴的和平运动已成为广泛的群众运动，古巴全国保卫和平委员会包括了各个阶层的代表，如工人、青年、学生、教授、妇女、黑人等的代表。和平委员会的主席是一位哈瓦那大学的历史教授伊利亚斯·恩特拉尔哥博士。
    古巴人民也和中国人民一样，为反对美帝国主义的经济和政治的侵略而进行着坚决的斗争。他们要争取把他们的产品不但卖给美国，还要能够自由地卖给苏联、中国和人民民主国家。
    去年，古巴陆军总司令加布勒拉将军被华盛顿召去训话。他回来以后，苏加拉斯总统就向国会请求派遣军队到朝鲜去参加侵略战争。这件事引起了人民激烈的反对。在各大学、中学和街上都有广大的群众集会来反对政府的卖国阴谋。在人民强大的压力下，古巴没有派遣任何士兵到朝鲜去，这是古巴人民的一大胜利。这也证明朝鲜人民反对帝国主义侵略的正义战争是得到了古巴人民的热烈的同情的。因为这两个国家都是被侵略的国家。
    我们的国际斗争和国内斗争是紧密地联系着的。古巴共产党在它的主席儒安·马里奈洛和总书记布拉斯·罗加的领导下，不断地努力于建立广泛的民族统一战线，去联合一切反对政府的党派积极参加一九五二年二月一日的大选。我们不但要争取大选的胜利，还要建立一个爱好和平的、独立的廉洁的政府，一个反对官僚主义和浪费现象的政府。我们要学习在英明的毛泽东主席领导下的中国，永远摆脱美帝国主义的枷锁。
    现在我代表古巴人民高呼：中国人民万岁！中国人民的英明领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    我代表古巴保卫和平委员会高呼：中国人民保卫世界和平反对美国侵略委员会万岁！
    我代表古巴共产党高呼：自由、民主与和平的旗帜，光荣的中国共产党万岁！（董宁川译）（附图片）
