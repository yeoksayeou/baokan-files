    Corrupt Element Li Xiangting and Profiteer Lu Huimin Colluded, Stealing Nearly 1 Billion Yuan in National Assets Over Three Years; The Two Criminals Were Arrested Together in Beijing While Conspiring to Form a "Pact of Mutual Defense"
    Corrupt element Li Xiangting and others from the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, and Tianjin profiteers Lu Huimin, Ma Kunsheng, and others, through a long period of ingenious and forceful plundering, stole nearly 1 billion yuan in national assets. Profiteer Lu Huimin was arrested together with Li Xiangting by the Beijing People's Court when he secretly came to Beijing to conspire with Li Xiangting to form a pact of mutual defense.
    Corrupt element Li Xiangting joined local troops in 1939, left work in 1945 to return home and engage in business, and rejoined work in 1947, serving as a purchasing agent for the Second Printing Bureau of the Jinnan Bank. In the same year, when he was purchasing printing materials in Tianjin, he colluded with Lu Huimin (formerly a purchasing agent for the Second Printing Bureau, left work in 1949 to return home and engage in business), Wei Shutian (formerly a purchasing agent for the Second Printing Bureau, arrested by the Tianjin People's Court and formerly an employee of the Tianjin People's Printing Factory), Geng Jimeng (formerly a purchasing agent for the Second Printing Bureau, now working in the Central and Southern Branch of the People's Bank), and others to engage in fraud, falsely reporting losses and embezzling 800 pounds of ink purchased for public use. After the liberation of Tianjin in 1949, Li Xiangting and Lu Huimin, in order to steal national assets for a long time, established a hidden nest. They used this batch of embezzled national assets as a foundation, and in March 1949, opened the Jilu Printing Materials Shop in Tianjin. In order to expand their scope, they subsequently added a branch in Shanghai. Lu Huimin served as the deputy manager of the Tianjin headquarters, and Ma Kunsheng served as the manager of the Tianjin headquarters and the person in charge of the Shanghai branch. Li Xiangting seemingly had nothing to do with them on the surface, but in reality, he was one of the shareholders and also one of the people in charge of the Jilu Printing Materials Shop.
    After the corrupt elements and profiteers established a stronghold for attacking the national bank—the Jilu Printing Materials Shop—they used various vicious methods to continuously steal national assets for a long period of time.
    One of their vicious methods was to deploy "internal agents" in the printing departments of the national bank in order to monopolize the procurement business of the printing departments. For example, three of the six important components of the Jilu Printing Materials Shop were working in the national bank (Li Xiangting was in the Printing Administration Bureau of the Beijing Head Office, Wei Shutian was in the Tianjin People's Printing Factory, and Cai Zhikang was in the Xi'an People's Printing Factory). In addition, they also used bribery to collude with Liao Hechang, the director of the purchasing office of the Central and Southern Branch of the People's Bank in Shanghai, and embezzled national funds through him. Under the control of corrupt elements such as Li Xiangting, many businesses, especially the profitable ones, of the procurement business of the aforementioned national bank printing institutions were contracted to the Jilu Printing Materials Shop.
    Another of their vicious methods was to arbitrarily increase prices in the materials sold to the state or purchased on behalf of the state, thereby reaping exorbitant profits. For example, when the Jilu Printing Materials Shop purchased 1,600 numbering machines on behalf of the Printing Administration Bureau of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China in 1949, these shameless people added illegal profits worth approximately 14,000 catties of rice on top of the normal profits. In the same year, they added illegal profits worth approximately 280,000 catties of rice in the purchase of 50 large paper cutter blades.
    Another vicious method they used to steal national assets was to collude with cadres of the national bank and embezzle national funds for speculation. Lu Huimin, Ma Kunsheng, and others embezzled 500,000 yuan of national funds (equivalent to approximately 50,000 catties of millet at the time) through Liao Hechang in the early stage of opening the Jilu Printing Materials Shop. In June 1949, when Ma Kunsheng was reselling rice in Shanghai during price fluctuations, he embezzled 20 million yuan of national funds through Liao Hechang (equivalent to more than 280,000 catties of rice at the time, now equivalent to more than 500 million yuan). Ma Kunsheng repeatedly speculated and resold rice several times with this fund, causing incalculable losses to the country.
    The Jilu Printing Materials Shop, which started by embezzling national assets (800 pounds of ink), was continuously stealing assets from the state by corrupt elements and profiteers through monopolization, price increases, and other means to increase capital. By the time this case was revealed, it was already a printing materials shop with nearly 1 billion yuan in funds.
    Corrupt element Li Xiangting and others began stealing national assets three years ago, so why was it not detected for a long time? The main reason is that the relevant leading cadres had serious bureaucratic work styles. In addition, corrupt element Li Xiangting had a characteristic, that is, he long pretended to have a "simple life" to paralyze the people around him. Before the anti-corruption struggle, he was mistakenly regarded by his superior leading cadres as one of the cadres with a "hard life." However, he finally could not escape the dragnet of the mass anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy struggle; no matter how meticulously corrupt elements disguise themselves, it will not work.

### 贪污分子李祥庭奸商卢惠民相互勾结  三年来窃取国家资财近十亿元  两犯在京商订“攻守同盟”时一起被捕获

    贪污分子李祥庭奸商卢惠民相互勾结  
    三年来窃取国家资财近十亿元  
    两犯在京商订“攻守同盟”时一起被捕获
    中国人民银行总行贪污分子李祥庭等和天津奸商卢惠民、马坤生等经过长时期的巧取豪夺，共窃取了国家资财近十亿元。奸商卢惠民在潜来北京和李祥庭商订攻守同盟时一起被北京人民法院逮捕起来。
    贪污分子李祥庭一九三九年参加地方部队，一九四五年脱离工作回家经商，一九四七年再度参加工作，担任冀南银行第二印刷局的采购员。同年他在天津采购印刷材料时，曾和卢惠民（以前是第二印刷局采购员，一九四九年脱离工作回家经商）、魏书田（以前是第二印刷局采购员，被天津人民法院逮捕以前任天津人民印刷厂采购员）、耿吉孟（以前是第二印刷局采购员，现在人民银行中南区行工作）等通统作弊，假报丢失，侵吞了为公家采购的油墨八百磅。一九四九年天津解放后，李祥庭和卢惠民等为了长期盗窃国家的资财，设立隐蔽他们的巢穴，就用这批侵吞国家的资财为基础，一九四九年三月在天津开设冀鲁印刷材料行。他们为了扩张范围，随后在上海增设分号一处。卢惠民担任天津总号的副经理，马坤生担任天津总号经理兼上海分号负责人。李祥庭表面上和他们没有什么关系，实际上他是冀鲁印刷材料行的股东之一，同时也是负责人之一。
    贪污分子和奸商们建立了向国家银行进攻的据点——冀鲁印刷材料行以后，用种种恶毒的手段，长期不断地盗取国家的资财。
    他们的恶毒的手段之一，是在国家银行印制部门中布置“内应”，以垄断印制部门的采购业务。如冀鲁印刷材料行的六个重要组成分子中就有三个在国家银行担任工作（李祥庭在北京总行印制管理局，魏书田在天津人民印刷厂，蔡志康在西安人民印刷厂）。此外，他们还用行贿的办法勾引人民银行中南区行驻上海采办处主任廖和长，通过他盗用国家的资金。上述各国家银行印刷机构的采购业务，在李祥庭等贪污分子控制下，很多生意，特别是得利多的生意，都由冀鲁印刷材料行包了下来。
    他们的另一恶毒手段是在出售给国家或为国家代购物资中任意加价，攫取暴利。如一九四九年冀鲁印刷材料行为人民银行总行印制管理局代购的一千六百个号码机时，这些无耻之徒除在正常利润之外还另加上约值一万四千斤大米的非法利润。同年又在代购大裁纸刀片五十片中另加约值二十八万斤大米的非法利润。
    他们盗窃国家资财的又一个恶毒手段是勾引国家银行的干部，盗用国家的资金投机倒把。卢惠民、马坤生等在冀鲁印刷材料行开设初期，通过廖和长盗用了国家资金五十万元（当时约合五万斤小米）。一九四九年六月马坤生趁物价波动在上海捣卖大米时，又通过廖和长盗用了国家资金两千万元（当时约折合大米二十八万多斤，现合五亿多元）。马坤生用这笔资金反复投机倒卖大米数次，使国家蒙受无法计算的损失。
    用侵吞国家的资财（八百磅油墨）起家的冀鲁印刷材料行，由贪污分子、奸商通过垄断、加价等手段不断向国家窃取资财增加资本，到这一案件被揭发时止，已是一个拥有近十亿元资金的印刷材料行了。
    贪污分子李祥庭等在三年前就开始盗窃国家资财，为什么长时期没有被察觉呢？主要的原因是有关领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风。另外，贪污分子李祥庭有一个特点，就是长期伪装“生活朴素”，来麻痹他周围的人。在反贪污斗争以前，他曾被所属领导干部错误地认为是“生活艰苦”的干部之一。然而，他终于逃不脱群众性的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的天罗地网；贪污分子伪装得再严密也是不行的。　（近宇）
