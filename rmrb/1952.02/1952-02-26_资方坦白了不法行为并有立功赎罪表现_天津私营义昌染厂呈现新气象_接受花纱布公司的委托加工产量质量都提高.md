    The Capitalist Confesses Illegal Activities and Demonstrates Merit for Redemption
    New Atmosphere at Tianjin Private Yichang Dyeing Factory
    Increased Output and Quality After Accepting Commissioned Processing from China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company
    The capitalist of the private Yichang Dyeing Factory in the Eleventh District of Tianjin has relatively thoroughly confessed to various illegal acts of stealing state assets and has demonstrated merit for redemption by exposing various methods of cutting corners in the dyeing and finishing industry. The Tianjin Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company then entrusted the dyeing factory with the processing of 1,500 bolts of blue twill cloth. The factory's employees, in order to urge the capitalist to improve management and earnestly implement the processing contract, have displayed a high degree of production enthusiasm, giving the dyeing factory a new look. Currently, the daily output of dyed cloth has increased from more than 100 bolts in the past to 200 bolts, and the number of defective products has also been greatly reduced. In the past ten days, the factory has delivered work to the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company three times, and after acceptance inspection, all were up to standard. This is unprecedented for this dyeing factory.
    The capitalist of the Yichang Dyeing Factory had many illegal activities in the past three years. They had used almost all the various methods of stealing state assets used by illegal capitalists of private dyeing factories, and the amount of state assets stolen was also very large, totaling more than 400 million yuan. When the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence began, Deng Weixun, the deputy manager of the factory, participated in a confession study class for industry and commerce. At that time, he was unwilling to truthfully confess the illegal activities he had committed. He thought, "I'll say as little as possible. Anyway, others don't have a clear idea of Yichang's 'bottom line.'" He was afraid that if he confessed all his illegal activities, the charges would be very serious. Not only would he be punished, but he would no longer be able to get processing work from state-owned enterprises, and his business would be in great difficulty, perhaps even collapse. Therefore, his confession was not thorough. However, as the movement unfolded fiercely, he realized that it was impossible to get away with not confessing honestly. He saw in the newspapers that some unscrupulous merchants who refused to confess were arrested and dealt with by the people's court, and he felt a great deal of pressure. He also thought that the employees were clear about his illegal activities. He watched as the trade union led the employees in organizing a reporting group, which studied reporting materials every night; the trade union committee members mobilized him to confess every day and specifically pointed out the factory's past instances of cutting corners. Under these circumstances, he felt that he could not hide any longer. So, he began to calculate and reflect. Finally, he relatively thoroughly confessed his illegal activities in the study class, wrote a confession letter, and provided a conclusion. The Eleventh District Thrift Inspection Sub-Committee hoped that he could repent and make a fresh start, and atone for his crimes with good deeds. He also knew that he had to do this in order to further strive for lenient treatment from the people's government. Therefore, he told the Eleventh District Thrift Inspection Sub-Committee all the ways to cut corners in the entire dyeing and finishing industry, and he helped the inspection team calculate accounts for other dyeing factories. However, he still had doubts about Yichang's future operations.
    On February 13, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company entrusted Yichang Dyeing Factory with dyeing 1,500 bolts of blue twill cloth. Deng Weixun felt very surprised. He further realized that if he had not thoroughly confessed his illegal activities, such a good thing would not have happened today; as long as he worked hard under the leadership of the state-owned economy in the future, Yichang Dyeing Factory would have a promising future. Therefore, Deng Weixun's business confidence was enhanced. After receiving this batch of processing work, he consulted with the employees on how to do it.
    In the past, workers never knew how capitalists signed contracts with the public sector, and they were also unaware of the capitalists' cutting corners. For example, if the contract stipulated that the dyed cloth should be given 30 degrees of "luster," the capitalist would say 28 degrees in order to use less caustic soda, so that two pieces of caustic soda would be used less for every ten bolts of cloth. Now, the capitalist has given the responsibility of controlling the "luster" to the workers. The trade union looks at how many degrees of "luster" are stipulated in the contract, and then lets the workers mix the caustic soda and apply that many degrees of "luster," with no difference at all. The cloth edges that are cut off are stipulated to be one inch in the contract, and the workers cut them according to one inch. After the cloth is dyed, it is inspected by the workers. The workers are particularly careful when inspecting the cloth, and not a single second-grade product is mixed into the first-grade products by mistake. In the past, when this dyeing factory processed dyed cloth for the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, it often delivered the goods without washing off the floating color. Sometimes it was found during inspection, and the goods were returned; sometimes it was not found, and it was slipped through. Now, after the cloth is dyed, it is washed once more with boiling water to wash off the floating color on the surface of the cloth, and the original color is guaranteed not to change at all.
    The employees saw that the capitalist had a lot of business confidence and was trying to overcome the difficulties of capital turnover, and their production enthusiasm was even higher. Last year, when processing dyed cloth for the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, because the dyed cloth had flaws, sometimes the cloth was torn on the stretching machine, and the defective cloth produced every day accounted for 4 percent of the output; now the workers have established a group responsibility system, with each group dividing the work and taking responsibility, so that the defective cloth rate has been reduced to 0.5 percent.

### 资方坦白了不法行为并有立功赎罪表现  天津私营义昌染厂呈现新气象  接受花纱布公司的委托加工产量质量都提高

    资方坦白了不法行为并有立功赎罪表现
    天津私营义昌染厂呈现新气象
    接受花纱布公司的委托加工产量质量都提高
    天津市十一区私营义昌染厂资方比较彻底地坦白了盗窃国家资财的种种不法行为，并有检举染整业偷工减料各种办法的立功赎罪表现，中国花纱布公司天津分公司就又给这个染厂承染一千五百匹青斜纹布的加工活。这个染厂的职工为了督促资方改进经营，认真执行加工合同，发挥了高度的生产积极性，使这个染厂呈现一番新气象。目前染布的日产量已从过去一百多匹提高到二百匹，残品也大大减少。十天以来，这个厂向花纱布公司交了三次活，经过验收，都合规格，这是这家染厂从未有过的事。
    义昌染厂的资本家，在过去三年中曾有过不少的不法行为。私营染厂不法资本家盗窃国家资财的种种办法，他们几乎都用过，盗窃国家资财的数字也很大，共四亿元以上。反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动开始时，这个厂的副经理邓伟勋参加了工商界坦白学习班。当时，他对于自己干过的这些不法行为，不愿据实坦白。他想：“能少说点就少说点，反正别人对义昌的‘底儿’摸不太清。”他怕把自己的不法行为都说出来了，罪名很大，不但要受惩办，以后再做不到国营企业的加工活，经营上会有很大困难，说不定会垮台。因此，他坦白得很不彻底。但是运动猛烈地展开了，他发觉不老实坦白，是无论如何混不过去的。从报上看到有些拒不坦白的奸商由人民法院逮捕法办了，他感到一种很大的压力。他又想到，自己的不法行为，职工是清楚的。眼看着工会领导职工组织了检举小组，每天晚上都在研究检举材料；工会委员每天动员自己坦白，并且具体指出厂里过去偷工减料的情形。在这种情形下，他感到自己不能隐瞒下去了。于是，他开始算账，进行反省。最后，他在学习班上比较彻底地坦白了自己的不法行为，写了坦白书，并具了结。十一区节约检查分会希望他能悔过自新，戴罪立功。他也知道必须这样做，才能进一步争取到人民政府的宽大处理，于是，他就把整个染整业的偷工减料办法都向十一区节约检查分会说了，并且帮助检查组去给别家染厂算账。但是，他对义昌将来的经营总还存着疑虑。
    二月十三日，花纱布公司委托义昌染厂染一千五百匹青斜纹布，邓伟勋感到很突然。他进一步认识到：自己要不是彻底坦白了不法行为，就不会有今天这样的好事情；今后只要在国营经济的领导下好好地干，义昌染厂是有发展前途的。因此，邓伟勋的经营信心增强了。他接到这批加工活后，就和职工商量如何做。
    以前，工人从来不知道资本家是怎样和公家订的合同，资本家从中偷工减料，工人也不知道。譬如合同上规定染布要加三十度“司光”，资本家为了少用火碱，就说成二十八度，这样每十匹布就少用了两块火碱。现在资方把掌握“司光”的责任交给工人，工会看合同上规定是多少度“司光”，就让工人配好火碱上多少度“司光”，一点儿也差不了。剪下的布边，合同上规定是一寸，工人就按一寸剪，布染完以后，再由工人验。工人验布时格外认真，二等品就没有一匹误掺到一等品里去的。这个染厂过去给花纱布公司加工时，常常没把浮色洗掉就交货。有时验出来了，就把货打回来；有时验不出来，就混过去。现在，在布染完以后，就用开水多洗一次，洗去布面上的浮色，原色还要保证丝毫不变。
    职工们看到资本家很有经营信心，想办法克服资金周转的困难，生产情绪也更高了。去年给花纱布公司加工染布，因为染的布出了花缕，有时在拉长机上把布扯出了口子，每天所出的残布占产量百分之四；现在工人们建立了小组负责制，各小组分工负责，使残布率降低到百分之零点五。
