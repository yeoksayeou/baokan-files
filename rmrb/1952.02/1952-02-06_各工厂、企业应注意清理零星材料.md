    All Factories and Enterprises Should Pay Attention to Cleaning Up Scattered Materials
    To the Editor: In the work of asset inventory and capital verification carried out by state-owned and public enterprises in various regions, appropriate attention should be paid to cleaning up scattered materials, which represents a significant opportunity for savings. Some factories and enterprises only clean up fixed assets of greater value and larger circulating assets, but they do not inventory and record those scattered off-the-books materials of small value and quantity, such as scrap copper and iron. This is because the people responsible for this work have a "fear of trouble" mentality. I believe that scattered materials should not be neglected, but should be inventoried and utilized. Otherwise, some scattered materials will be abandoned and unattended, and over time, these materials will corrode and rot, causing great waste. Therefore, I suggest that state-owned and public enterprises in various regions, during the work of asset inventory and capital verification, should appropriately mobilize the masses of workers to conduct a thorough "clean sweep," re-cleaning every corner that has not been inventoried. In this way, it will also play a certain role in saving resources.

    各工厂、企业应注意清理零星材料
    编辑同志：各地的国营、公营企业在清理资产核定资金工作中，应适当地注意清理零星材料，这是一个很大的节约。有的工厂企业只清理价值较大的固定资产和较大的流动资产，但他们对于那些价值不大，数量较小的账外零星材料，如废铜烂铁等，则不清点记账。这是因为负责这个工作的人，有“怕麻烦”思想。我认为对于零星材料也不应忽视，应加以清点，使其发挥应有的作用。不然，有些零星材料就会被弃置无人过问，日子久了之后，这些材料就被腐蚀霉烂了，造成很大浪费。因此，我建议各地国营、公营企业在清理资产核定资金工作中，应适当地发动职工群众来一次“大清底”，把所有未经清点过的每个角落，重新清理一番。这样，在节约方面，也会起到一定的作用。
