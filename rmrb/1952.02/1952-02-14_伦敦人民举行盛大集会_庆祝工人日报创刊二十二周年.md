Xinhua News Agency, London, February 11th: TASS London, February 11th: Ten thousand British people held a grand meeting in one of London's largest indoor stadiums on February 10th to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the British Communist Party's organ, the "Workers' Daily."

    "Workers' Daily" Deputy Editor-in-Chief Gollan addressed the meeting. When he said, "The British people will not, under any circumstances, wage war against the People's Republic of China," the audience immediately erupted in loud cheers.

    The Vice-Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Communist Party, Dutt, spoke of the liberation struggles being waged in Korea, Malaya, India, Egypt, and other parts of the world, saying: The British people must revive the spirit they had in 1920, when the British working class prevented war against the Soviet Union. Dutt said: We must save Britain from the destruction caused by the current arms expansion program. He called on the participants to demand that American troops withdraw from Britain so that Britain could independently and freely develop trade between itself and other parts of the world.

    "Workers' Daily" Editor-in-Chief Campbell said: The British labor movement must use its enormous power to guarantee peace. He called for strengthening the unity of the labor movement to oppose Churchill and the war plans of the right-wing Labour leaders.

    The General Secretary of the British Communist Party, Pollitt, sent a letter to the conference, calling on everyone to strengthen the struggle for peace. In his letter, Pollitt demanded that British troops withdraw from Korea, Malaya, and Egypt, and that American rule over Britain be ended. The letter was received with cheers from the entire audience when it was read.
