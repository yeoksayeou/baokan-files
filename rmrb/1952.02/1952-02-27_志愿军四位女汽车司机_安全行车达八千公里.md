Xinhua News Agency, Korean Front, February 26th: On the Korean transportation line, there are four women truck drivers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Driving two military vehicles, they fight shoulder to shoulder with the male drivers on the mountainous Korean land. Their names are Meng Qingyun, Chu Guiying, Bian Ruilan, and Sun Guilan. They were originally truck drivers at a factory in Dalian City, China. In order to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea and defend the motherland, they volunteered to join the transportation unit of a certain Volunteer Army unit.

Like other Volunteer Army drivers, they have experienced many dangers, overcome various difficulties, and successfully completed every transportation task. Like other Volunteer Army drivers, they have become excellent truck drivers. Whether it is a pitch-black night, a heavy snowfall in the severe winter, or a rainy season of mountain floods, they drive at will between the front and the rear.

These four women drivers take great care of the vehicles they drive. They said, "One more trip means one more point of victory. We would rather put in more effort ourselves than let the vehicle be in danger and delay transportation." After the vehicle arrives at its destination, no matter how tired they are, they always camouflage the vehicle first and check it several times before resting. So far, the two aging trucks they drive have each created a record of 8,000 kilometers of safe driving. After the conservation movement began, they formulated new plans, expressing their determination to improve their skills and better protect state property.

    志愿军四位女汽车司机
    安全行车达八千公里
    【新华社朝鲜前线二十六日电】在朝鲜运输线上有四位志愿军女汽车司机，她们驾驶着两辆军用车，和男司机们并肩战斗在多山的朝鲜土地上。她们的名字叫孟庆云、楚桂英、边瑞兰和孙桂兰。她们原来是中国旅大市一个工厂里的汽车司机。为了抗美援朝保卫祖国，她们志愿报名参加了志愿军某运输部队的工作。
    她们像其他志愿军的司机一样，经历了许多危险，战胜了各种困难，胜利地完成了每一次的运输任务。他们和其他志愿军的司机一样，已成为优秀的汽车司机，不论是伸手不见五指的黑夜，或者是大雪纷飞的严冬，或者是山洪暴发的雨季，她们都随心所欲地驰骋在前线和后方。
    这四位女司机对自己驾驶的车辆十分爱护。她们说：“多跑一趟车就多增加一分胜利，宁肯自己多出力，也决不让车子出危险而耽误了运输。”汽车到达目的地后，她们不管如何疲劳，总是先把车子伪装好，检查过好几遍后才去休息。到现在为止，她们驾驶的两辆超过车龄的卡车都已各创造了安全行车八千公里的纪录。在节约运动开始后，她们又订立了新计划，表示要努力提高技术，更好地爱护国家物资。
