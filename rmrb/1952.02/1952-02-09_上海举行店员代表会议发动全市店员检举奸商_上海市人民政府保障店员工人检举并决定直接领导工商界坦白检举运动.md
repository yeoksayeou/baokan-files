Xinhua News Agency Report: Shanghai shop assistants held a representative meeting on the 7th of February for the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, substandard workmanship and theft of state economic intelligence, vowing to launch an attack on illegal merchants. All shop assistants in the city were organized to listen to the live broadcast of the meeting.

Han Xiya, Vice-Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees' Union, announced at the meeting that from the 7th, 160,000 shop assistants in privately owned stores throughout the city had taken up positions to fiercely open fire on illegal merchants. He called on shop assistant representatives, young shop assistants, and trade union cadres in various districts to mobilize accountants, salespersons, senior shop assistants, and other shop assistants who still had concerns, as well as employees who had relatives with the capitalists, so that they could also participate in the movement. Zhang Qi, Vice-Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, said in his speech that state-owned enterprises and government organs across the country had mostly purchased goods in Shanghai, and Shanghai was the place with the most big "tigers" in the country. He encouraged shop employees and workers to bravely report the crimes of illegal merchants.

Reports were made during the meeting. Shop assistant representatives from various districts sent 48,096 letters of accusation they had brought to the rostrum. At this time, letters of accusation flew in like snowflakes from inside and outside the meeting. 23,519 letters of accusation were received on the spot and notified by telephone from the trade unions in various districts.

Representatives of the grassroots organizations of the Shop Employees' Union presented letters of guarantee to the conference, guaranteeing to mobilize all shop employees to participate in the movement; guaranteeing not to withdraw their troops until victory was achieved. They also launched challenges and responses to each other.

The meeting adopted a resolution calling on every grassroots trade union organization to establish branch committees for the movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, substandard workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence; to establish inspection teams to go deep into each store group to ensure the mobilization of all shop employees to thoroughly report the illegal acts of the bourgeoisie. The resolution also called on all shop employees in the city to immediately, in units of stores or groups, formulate patriotic pledges against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, substandard workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence based on specific circumstances, and implement them in actual actions.

The meeting finally passed a telegram to Chairman Mao. All representatives pledged to Chairman Mao: to deeply mobilize all shop employees to join this fiery struggle, to resolutely carry out reporting, to attack illegal capitalists at every level, and not to withdraw our troops until complete victory is achieved!

Xinhua News Agency Report: The Shanghai Municipal People's Government Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held an enlarged joint meeting on the 5th to discuss the issue of launching a movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, substandard workmanship, and theft of state economic intelligence throughout the city, and to adjust the organization to strengthen leadership over the movement.

Pan Hannian, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, reported at the meeting that leading cadres at all levels of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government have made the greatest determination to mobilize the broad masses and thoroughly pursue and eliminate corrupt elements. In the near future, it will enter the stage of key inspections and partial handling, and can free up forces to directly lead the movement in the business community.

Sheng Pihua, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, reported that the illegal acts of the Shanghai business community since liberation, according to preliminary exposed materials, have been very serious. However, these preliminary confessions are all taking things lightly and are not sincere and honest. At present, the attitude of the Shanghai business community towards the movement is not active enough, and most illegal merchants still hold an attitude of evasion and resistance. He requested that the Municipal People's Government directly lead the movement in the business community, and that the work of mailboxes, reporting boxes, and receiving confession talks of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and various trade associations be uniformly controlled by the Municipal People's Government.

Han Xiya, Vice-Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Shop Employees' Union, reported on the participation of Shanghai shop employees and workers in the reporting movement, and put forward two suggestions, requesting the People's Government to further stipulate: 1. To ensure that shop employees will not lose their livelihood security due to reporting illegal merchants during or after the reporting movement; 2. If shop employees are harmed by illegal merchants after reporting them, in addition to severely punishing the murderers according to law, the illegal merchants shall also be responsible for maintaining the lifelong living expenses of the victim's family members.

The meeting adopted the two proposals on guaranteeing shop employees and workers' right to report, and made a decision that the Municipal People's Government shall stipulate and implement them. The meeting also decided that all confessions and reports from the business community shall be uniformly accepted by the Municipal People's Government, and all original confession and reporting agencies of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce and various trade associations shall cease working. The meeting finally decided: The Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Economy Practice Inspection Committee will directly lead the movement in the business community, and should make preparations before February 15.

    上海举行店员代表会议发动全市店员检举奸商
    上海市人民政府保障店员工人检举并决定直接领导工商界坦白检举运动
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海市店员七日举行反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报运动代表会议，向不法商人誓师出击。全市店员都组织收听会议实况广播。
    中国店员工会上海市委员会副主席韩西雅在会上宣布：从七日开始，全市十六万私营商店店员已摆开阵势，向不法商人猛烈开火。他号召各区店员代表、青年店员、工会干部要去动员私营商店的会计、跑街、老年店员和其他还有顾虑的店员以及与资方有亲戚关系的职工，使他们也参加到运动中来。上海总工会副主席张琪在讲话中说：全国各地国家企业、机关大都到上海采购过东西，上海是全国大老虎最多的地方。他鼓励店员工人勇敢检举不法商人的罪行。
    大会中途进行检举。各区店员代表将带来的检举信四万八千零九十六件送上主席台。这时会内会外检举信像雪片一样飞来。当场收到的和各区工会电话通知收到的检举信有两万三千五百一十九封。
    店员工会各基层组织的代表纷纷向大会提出保证书：保证动员所有店员参加运动；保证不达胜利，决不收兵。彼此间并展开挑战应战。
    会议通过决议，号召每一基层工会组织都要建立反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报运动委员会支会；都要建立检查组，深入到每个商店小组去检查，以保证动员全体店员彻底检举资产阶级的违法行为。决议并号召全市店员立即以商店或小组为单位，根据具体情况，订立反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料和反盗窃国家经济情报爱国公约，并贯彻到实际行动中去。
    会议最后通过致毛主席的电报。全体代表向毛主席提出保证：深入发动所有店员投入这个火热的斗争，坚决地进行检举，向不法资本家层层进攻，不获全胜，决不收兵！
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海市人民政府委员会、上海市各界人民代表会议协商委员会在五日举行扩大联席会议，讨论在全市开展反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动的问题，并调整组织以加强对运动的领导。
    上海市人民政府副市长潘汉年在会上报告说：上海市人民政府一级各机关领导干部已下定最大决心，发动广大群众，穷追痛剿贪污犯。最近期内即可进入重点检查及部分处理的阶段，并可抽出力量来直接领导工商界的运动。
    市工商业联合会主任委员盛丕华报告说：上海工商界自解放以来的违法行为，据初步暴露的材料来看，已十分严重。而这些初步坦白的材料，都避重就轻，不是真诚老实的。目前上海市工商界对待运动的态度还不够积极，大多数不法商人至今还抱着逃避和对抗的态度。他要求市人民政府直接领导工商界的运动，工商业联合会和各同业公会接受检举的邮箱、检举箱、接待坦白谈话等工作一律由市人民政府统一掌握。
    中国店员工会上海市委员会副主席韩西雅在会上报告上海市店员工人参加检举运动的情况，并提出两项建议，要求人民政府进一步规定：一、保证店员工人在检举运动中或在检举运动后，不致因检举奸商而失去生活上的保障；二、店员工人在检举奸商后如遭受奸商谋害，除依法严惩凶手外，并要奸商负责维持被害人家属终身生活费用。
    会议通过了关于保障店员工人检举的两项提议，作出决定，由市人民政府规定执行。会议并决定工商界的坦白、检举一律由市人民政府统一受理，市工商业联合会和各同业公会原有的坦白、检举机构一律停止工作。会议最后决定：市人民政府和市节约检查委员会直接领导工商界的运动，并应在二月十五日前做好准备工作。
