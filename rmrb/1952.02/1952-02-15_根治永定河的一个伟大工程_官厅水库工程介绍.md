    A Great Project to Fundamentally Control the Yongding River
    ——Introduction to the Guanting Reservoir Project
    Lu Sheng
    The Guanting Reservoir project, one of the major projects to fundamentally control the Yongding River, officially commenced last winter. This project is an important part of fundamentally controlling the Yongding River and developing its water resources.

    The Yongding River is a major river in North China, with tributaries such as the Sanggan River, Yang River, and Gui River in its upper reaches, covering a total drainage area of approximately 45,100 square kilometers, of which about 70 percent is loess plateau and hilly terrain. These three tributaries converge and flow into the Guanting Gorge (110 kilometers long) in Huailai County, Chahar Province, and then exit the gorge at Sanjiadian in Wanping County, Hebei Province, flowing into the Hebei Plain. The river then enters the New Flood Area at Lianggezhuang in Gu'an County, and finally flows into the Bohai Sea via the North Canal and the Hai River. Because the slope above Sanjiadian is steep and the water flow is rapid, the river often carries large amounts of sediment. After entering the plain, the water flow slows down, and large amounts of sediment are deposited along the way, raising the riverbed higher and higher. Moreover, because most of the annual rainfall is concentrated in July and August, the flow is extremely small during the dry spring season. However, when torrential rains occur, floods spread everywhere, causing huge disasters. To cite only recent examples, from 1912 to the liberation, floods occurred seven times, twice inundating the urban area of Tianjin. Each time, the flooded area covered between 400 and 1,600 square kilometers, with an average annual loss of 30 million jin of millet in agricultural products. The industries of Beijing and Tianjin, as well as railway transportation, were also seriously threatened. However, during the more than 20 years of reactionary Kuomintang rule, no serious efforts were made to control the river.

    After the liberation of North China in 1949, the People's Government paid attention to the work of fundamentally controlling the Yongding River. In November of the same year, the former North China People's Government Water Conservancy Committee proposed a preliminary plan for fundamentally controlling the Yongding River. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, it immediately carried out a series of regulation projects on the middle and lower reaches of the Yongding River based on manpower, material resources, and existing data: the dikes on both banks from Lugou Bridge to Lianggezhuang were strengthened and consolidated; the diversion channel in the lower reaches of the New Flood Area was excavated, so that the existing flooded area would not expand further and would be reduced as much as possible, striving to reduce disasters; the road protection dikes were repaired to protect the safety of the Beijing-Tianjin railway line; and a plan for fundamentally controlling the entire Yongding River basin was formulated.

    Fundamentally controlling the Yongding River is a rather arduous and complex undertaking. The main engineering tasks include the following three items: first, promoting soil and water conservation in the upper reaches; second, building reservoirs in the middle reaches by utilizing the mountain gorges; and third, regulating and dredging the river channels in the lower reaches. The most important project is building reservoirs in the middle reaches.

    The Guanting Reservoir is the largest reservoir in the plan to fundamentally control the Yongding River. The Guanting Reservoir is located directly downstream of the Yang River, Sanggan River, and Gui River, which is of the greatest significance for controlling the entire Yongding River basin and can store the most floodwater.

    The planning and preparation work for the construction of the Guanting Reservoir began in the second half of 1949. By last year, the geological exploration of the dam site, the transportation of equipment and the construction of roads, bridges, factories, warehouses, office buildings, and other related engineering preparation work had been completed. Last winter, the construction of the reservoir officially began. According to the engineering design, this reservoir will use the open area above the Guanting Gorge to store water, and a dam will be built at the mouth of the gorge. The planned earth dam is about 50 meters high, and the reservoir area is 220 square kilometers, which can store 2.09 billion cubic meters of floodwater. After the completion of this reservoir, it will not only basically eliminate the threat of flooding in the downstream area of the Yongding River, but also utilize the stored water to supply urban water, industrial water, generate electricity, irrigate farmland, regulate the downstream flow of the Yongding River, and facilitate navigation. During the construction, before the earth dam is built, a discharge tunnel (8 meters in diameter, 523 meters in length, with a maximum discharge capacity of 700 cubic meters per second) will be excavated on the right bank of the river for water diversion during the entire construction period. When the reservoir is completed, it can be used to transport water stored in the reservoir to the downstream to meet various needs. An intake tower will be built at the upper entrance of the tunnel, and movable gates will be installed as a mechanism to control the amount of water discharged. Secondly, a flood discharge channel will be excavated on the left bank by splitting mountains. If the flood is too large and exceeds the planned water level of the reservoir, a part of it can be diverted through the flood discharge channel to ensure the safety of the dam. The tunnel project is expected to be completed before the flood season this year; the earth dam project will also begin this spring, and the reservoir will begin to store floodwater before the flood season in 1953. The entire reservoir project is expected to be completed by the end of next year.

    The Yongding River has been a disaster for thousands of years, but the past dynasties and the Kuomintang reactionaries have never seriously implemented fundamental control. Now, the project to fundamentally control the Yongding River has begun. In the near future, after the other reservoirs of the Yongding River are completed, combined with the dredging and regulation projects in the downstream, the flow of the Yongding River will be completely controlled by human power, and the flood disaster of the Yongding River will be fundamentally eliminated. At the same time, most of the farmland near the reservoir and south of Beijing can also be irrigated with the water stored in the reservoir. (Attached picture)

    根治永定河的一个伟大工程
    ——官厅水库工程介绍
    鲁生
    根治永定河的巨大工程之一——官厅水库工程已在去年冬季正式开工了。这个工程是根治永定河及开发永定河水利的一个重要环节。
    永定河是华北的一条大河，上游有桑干河、洋河、妫水河等支流，流域面积共约四万五千一百平方公里，其中约百分之七十是黄土高原和丘陵地带。这三条支流汇合后，到察哈尔省怀来县官厅村流入官厅山峡（峡长一百一十公里），到河北省宛平县的三家店出峡流入河北大平原，经固安县的梁各庄入新泛区，再经北运河、海河流入渤海。因三家店以上坡度陡，水流急，河流常挟带大量泥沙而下，入平原后水流渐缓，大量泥沙沿途沉淀，河床越淤越高；又因每年雨量大部集中在七八两月，所以每到春季枯水期，流量极小，但一到雨季山洪暴发，洪水就到处泛滥，造成巨大灾害。远的不说，单从一九一二年到全国解放前的三十多年里，洪水就泛滥过七次，其中有两次曾淹及天津市区，每次被淹地区都有四百到一千五六百平方公里，农产品的损失，平均每年达三千万斤小米。北京、天津两市的工商业和铁道交通也受到严重的威胁。但在国民党反动统治的二十多年里，从来没有认真治理过。
    一九四九年华北解放后，人民政府就注意了根治永定河的工作。同年十一月，前华北人民政府水利委员会就提出了根治永定河的初步计划。中央人民政府成立后，立即根据人力、物力及现有资料，对永定河的中、下游进行了一系列的整理工程：加强和巩固了芦沟桥以下至梁各庄两岸的堤防；挑挖了新泛区下游的引河，使现有的被淹面积不再扩大，并尽量使它缩小，力求使灾害减轻；培修了护路堤，保护京津铁路线的安全；同时并制订出根治永定河全流域的计划。
    根治永定河是一个相当艰巨和复杂的事业。根治工程主要有下述三项：第一，在上游推行水土保持；第二，在中游利用山峡建筑水库；第三，在下游整理疏浚河道。其中最主要的工程就是在中游建筑水库。
    根治永定河计划中的水库以官厅水库为最大。官厅水库位置正当洋河、桑干河、妫水河下游，对永定河全流域的控制意义最大，拦蓄洪水也最多。
    修建官厅水库的规划和各项准备工作，从一九四九年下半年就已开始进行。到去年止已经完成坝址的地质钻探、运输器材和修建公路、桥梁、厂房、仓库、办公房屋以及有关工程的各项准备工作。去年冬季，修建水库的工程就正式开始了。按照工程设计，这个水库利用官厅山峡以上的开阔地带蓄水，在峡口筑坝。计划中的土坝约五十公尺高，水库面积为二百二十平方公里，可拦蓄洪水二十点九亿立方公尺。这个水库修成后，不但可以基本解除永定河下游地区的水患，而且还可利用所蓄的水来供给都市用水、工业用水、发电、灌溉农田和调剂永定河下游流量，便利航运。修建工程中，在修筑土坝以前，首先要在河的右岸开凿一条泄水隧洞（隧洞直径八公尺，洞身全长五百二十三公尺，最大的泄水量为每秒七百立方公尺），以便在全部施工期间作为导水之用；当水库完成后，即可用以输送库内存水到下游，供应各种需要。在隧洞上口将修建一个进水塔，并安装活动闸门，做为控制泄水量的机关。其次还要在左岸劈山开挖一条溢洪道，如遇洪水太大，超过水库的计划蓄水位时，就可由溢洪道分泄一部分，以保证坝身的安全。隧洞工程预计今年汛期前就可完成；土坝工程今春也要开始进行，到一九五三年汛期以前水库就可开始拦洪蓄水。水库的全部工程，预计明年年底可以完成。
    永定河为害已经一千数百年了，但历代皇朝和国民党反动派从来都没有认真施行过根本的治理。现在根治永定河的工程已开工了。不久的将来，永定河的其他水库都修成后，再结合下游的疏浚整理工程，永定河的流量将全部为人力所控制，永定河的水患也将根本消除。同时水库附近及北京市以南的大部农田还可利用水库的蓄水进行灌溉。（附图片）
