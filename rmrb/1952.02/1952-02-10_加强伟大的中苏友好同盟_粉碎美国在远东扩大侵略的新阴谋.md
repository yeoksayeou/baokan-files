    Strengthen the Great Sino-Soviet Friendship Alliance
    Smash the New Conspiracy of the United States to Expand Aggression in the Far East

    I. The U.S. Imperialism is Manufacturing a New Conspiracy to Expand the War of Aggression in the Far East

    After suffering a heavy defeat in the Korean War of aggression, U.S. imperialism has recently been actively engaged in a new conspiracy to expand its aggression in the Far East. It intends to collude with the Japanese reactionaries and the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan through an illegal treaty, as a preparation for creating a new war of aggression in the Far East. On January 16th, Tokyo, Japan, and Washington, D.C., in the United States simultaneously announced a letter written by Japanese reactionary government Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida to U.S. warmonger and State Department advisor John Foster Dulles on December 24th of last year. In this letter, Shigeru Yoshida openly guaranteed that the Japanese government would conclude some kind of "bilateral treaty" with the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan, and expressed its intention to continue assisting in the implementation of U.S. imperialism's aggressive measures against Korea and China. This reactionary behavior of the Yoshida government aroused opposition from the Chinese people, the Japanese people, and the people of other Asian countries. On January 23rd, Zhang Hanfu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of our country, issued a statement of justice on this matter. However, the Yoshida government continues to act perversely. Shigeru Yoshida has recently decided to send his own confidant, Hiroshi Kawada, to Taiwan in February for "negotiations."

    At the same time, U.S. imperialism has also taken a series of steps to prepare for expanding aggression in the Far East. For example, the illegal actions of rearming Japan have become even more blatant. Shigeru Yoshida openly declared at the Budget Committee of the Japanese House of Representatives on January 31st that the so-called "Police Reserve Force" would be reorganized into a "Defense Force" by October of this year. According to a report by the Japanese Kyodo News Agency, the Japanese government also plans to establish a "Security Agency" or "Defense Ministry," preparing to expand the armed forces to 300,000 in the future (250,000 for the army and 50,000 for the navy), and equip them with heavy weapons such as tanks and artillery. Kyodo News Agency said: "The de facto national defense system is appearing here in a renewed form." U.S. imperialism is also establishing aggressive bases on our southern border, driving the remaining Kuomintang bandit troops to harass our borders. As everyone remembers, when the People's Liberation Army annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops on the mainland of China in 1949, a small group of remnants fled from Yunnan into Myanmar. These bandits are now receiving supplies from U.S. bases on the Myanmar-Thailand border. The United States not only provides them with weapons, but also sent a group of U.S. officers (including two generals, seven colonels, and twenty-seven majors) to help them do evil.

    From this, it can be seen that the new conspiracy of the United States to prepare for expanding the war of aggression in the Far East is very obvious. The people of our country and the people of Asia must be highly vigilant about this matter.

    II. The Sino-Soviet Alliance and the Unity of the Asian People are Enough to Shatter the New Aggressive Conspiracy of the United States

    These conspiratorial activities of U.S. imperialism once again demonstrate that U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Chinese people and the Asian people, and at the same time demonstrates the weakness of U.S. imperialism itself. U.S. imperialism is frantically carrying out aggression all over the world, and one of its biggest weaknesses is its insufficient troop strength. The purpose of U.S. imperialism in colluding with Japanese militarists and Kuomintang remnants is to gather cannon fodder for the war of aggression through them. As everyone knows, Japanese militarists accumulated decades of aggressive power and had millions of armed forces, but were ultimately defeated by us and surrendered unconditionally. The Kuomintang bandit gang, supported by the United States with eight million troops, was also annihilated by us. Today, they only have a handful of lonely ghosts left, and their failure is inevitable.

    Compared with the time when Japan invaded China and the U.S.-Chiang clique enslaved China, the strength of the Chinese people is unprecedentedly powerful. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the entire Chinese people have rapidly established a strong national defense force and economic strength. Moreover, the Asian people have also awakened unprecedentedly. The Japanese people and the people of Southeast Asian countries, who have suffered from the disasters of the war of aggression, have also expressed great anger at the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism. Any conspiratorial activity of U.S. imperialism will definitely be thwarted in the face of the Asian people.

    What is even more important is the existence of the powerful Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This is the decisive factor that will inevitably lead to the failure of U.S. imperialism's plan for a war of aggression in the Far East. Our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Soviet people and the teacher of the working people of the world, Marshal Stalin, saw long ago that U.S. imperialism would foster the remnant forces of Japanese militarism to expand aggression. Therefore, two years ago, they concluded the great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. The great friendship between the peoples of the two countries has become more consolidated and developed since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance two years ago. This great treaty clearly stipulates the method of "jointly preventing the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression by Japan or other countries that collude with Japan in aggressive acts in any form." Now, as we commemorate the second anniversary of the signing of this great treaty, facing the conspiracy of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries colluding to prepare for expanding aggression, the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance demonstrates even greater significance. We, united with our great ally the Soviet Union, united with the fraternal democratic countries, and united with the Asian people, the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to expand aggression in the Far East will surely be smashed.

### 加强伟大的中苏友好同盟  粉碎美国在远东扩大侵略的新阴谋

专栏：宣传员讲话

    加强伟大的中苏友好同盟
    粉碎美国在远东扩大侵略的新阴谋
    一、美帝国主义正在远东制造扩大侵略战争的新阴谋
    美帝国主义在朝鲜进行侵略战争遭受了惨重的失败以后，最近又积极在远东进行扩大侵略的新阴谋。它打算把日本的反动派和台湾的国民党残匪用非法的和约勾结起来，作为在远东制造新的侵略战争的准备。一月十六日，日本东京和美国华盛顿同时公布了日本反动政府首相吉田茂在去年十二月二十四日写给美国战争贩子、国务院顾问杜勒斯的一封信。在这封信里，吉田茂公然保证日本政府将与台湾国民党残匪缔结什么“双边条约”，并且表示要继续协助执行美帝国主义对朝鲜和中国所采取的侵略措施。吉田政府这种反动行为，激起了中国人民、日本人民和亚洲其他国家人民的反对。我国中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长，在一月二十三日为此发表了正义的声明。可是吉田政府还在继续倒行逆施，吉田茂最近已决定派他自己的亲信河田烈在二月间前往台湾“谈判”。
    与此同时，美帝国主义还采取了一系列的在远东准备扩大侵略的步骤。例如，重新武装日本的非法行动更加露骨了。吉田茂一月三十一日在日本众议院预算委员会上公然宣称，要以今年十月为期，把所谓“警察后备队”改编为“防卫队”。据日本共同通讯社报道，日本政府并计划建立“保安省”或
    “国防省”，准备将来把武装部队扩充到三十万人
    （陆军二十五万、海军五万），并且配备坦克、大炮等重武器。共同通讯社说：“事实上的国防体制就在这里以再生的姿态出现。”美帝国主义又正在我国南方边境建立侵略基地，驱使残余的国民党匪军向我边境骚扰。大家记得，一九四九年人民解放军在全国大陆上歼灭蒋介石匪军时，曾有一小撮残匪从云南逃到缅甸境内。这些匪徒现在从缅泰边境的美国基地得到接济，美国不独供给他们以武器，还派了一批美国军官（包括两名将官、七名上校和二十七名少校）前去帮他们作恶。
    由此可见，美国在远东准备扩大侵略战争的新阴谋是十分明显的。我国人民和亚洲人民对于这件事情必须引起高度的警惕。
    二、中苏同盟和亚洲人民的团结足以击碎美国新的侵略阴谋
    美帝国主义这些阴谋活动，再一次表现了美帝国主义是中国人民和亚洲人民的死敌，同时也表现了美帝国主义本身的虚弱。美帝国主义在全世界疯狂地进行侵略，它的最大的弱点之一就是兵力不足。美帝国主义把日本军国主义分子和国民党残匪互相勾结起来，其目的就是要通过他们搜罗侵略战争的炮灰。大家知道，日本军国主义者从前积蓄了几十年的侵略力量、具有几百万武装部队，结果被我们打得无条件投降了；国民党匪帮获得美国支持的八百万军队，也被我们消灭了。今天他们只剩下了一撮孤魂野鬼，他们的失败是必然的。
    比起日本侵略中国和美蒋奴役中国那时候来，中国人民的力量已经空前强大了。全中国人民在毛主席、共产党领导之下，已经迅速建立起强大的国防力量和经济力量。而且，亚洲人民也空前地觉醒了，饱受侵略战争的灾害的日本人民和东南亚各国人民，对于美帝国主义的侵略行为也表示了极大的愤怒。美帝国主义的任何阴谋活动，在亚洲人民面前一定是要碰壁的。
    更加重要的是强大的中苏友好同盟互助条约的存在，这是使美帝国主义在远东的侵略战争计划必然归于失败的决定因素。我们的伟大领袖毛主席和苏联人民的伟大领袖、全世界劳动人民的导师斯大林大元帅，早就看到美帝国主义会要扶植日本军国主义残余势力扩大侵略的阴谋，因此在两年之前就订下了伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约。两国人民的伟大友谊，从中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两年以来更加巩固和发展了。这个伟大条约明确地规定了“共同防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”的办法。现在，我们在纪念这一伟大条约签订两周年的时候，面对着美日反动派勾结准备扩大侵略的阴谋，中苏友好同盟互助条约就显示了更加重大的意义。我们和伟大的盟友苏联团结在一起，和各兄弟民主国家团结在一起，和亚洲人民团结在一起，美国帝国主义在远东扩大侵略的阴谋是一定可以被击碎的。
