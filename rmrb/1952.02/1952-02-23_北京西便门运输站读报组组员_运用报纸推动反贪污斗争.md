    Beijing Xibianmen Transportation Station Reading Group Members
    Use Newspapers to Promote the Anti-Corruption Struggle
    Editor Comrades: All members of the Beijing Xibianmen Transportation Station Reading Group actively participated in the ranks of "tiger" hunting in the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. Every day, the readers select materials from the newspapers, targeting the crimes of corrupt elements and their ideological situations. On February 6th, the Workers' Daily published an article entitled "Zhang Xuewen's Confession is Incomplete and Still Has Loose Ends." The reading group immediately linked this to the crimes of corrupt elements Zhao Shiyan and Zheng Chongfeng, and conducted discussions, giving great pressure to the corrupt elements, and finally forcing Zheng Chongfeng to express his willingness to make a thorough confession to the masses.
    The reading group's study is closely linked to the actual situation of the unit. In the past, we had requested the higher authorities to add lighting equipment to the handling yard, but because the cost was too expensive (requiring 15 million yuan), this request had not been approved for a long time, resulting in many work-related injuries. Corrupt elements Li Zhenzhi, Ai Longming, Zheng Chongfeng, etc., colluded with unscrupulous merchants to steal state assets, causing the people to lose hundreds of millions of yuan (their confessions are still very incomplete). They used this money to visit prostitutes, eat and drink extravagantly. Such things aroused extreme anger among the workers. In order to publicize the "tiger" hunting battle reports in a timely manner, the reading group wrote the daily "tiger" hunting achievements into big-character posters and posted them; in addition, they also drew cartoons, performed clapper talks, and short plays. These things were all written based on the facts of the station. We compiled the crimes of Li Zhenzhi, the chief of the timber section, who stole and sold timber and cement, into clapper talks and drew them into cartoons, which made him look at it in shock and also played a great educational role for the masses.

    运用报纸推动反贪污斗争
    编辑同志：北京西便门运输站读报组全体组员，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，积极地参加了打“虎”的行列。每天读报员针对贪污分子的罪行及其思想情况，选读报纸上的材料。二月六日，工人日报上登载了“张学文坦白不彻底还留尾巴”的文章，读报组立即联系着贪污分子赵士彦、郑崇丰的罪行，进行讨论，给贪污分子以很大的压力，终于迫使郑崇丰向群众表示要彻底坦白。
    读报组的学习，是紧紧地结合着本单位的实际情况的。我们过去曾经要求上级在搬运场添置照明工具，但因费用太贵（需要一千五百万元），这一要求长期没有被批准，致发生多起工伤事故。贪污分子李振之、艾隆明、郑崇丰等，勾结奸商，盗卖国家资财，使人民损失数亿元（他们坦白得还很不彻底）。他们用这些钱嫖妓女、大吃大喝。这样的事，引起工人极度的愤怒。为了及时宣传“打虎”的战报，读报组把每天打“虎”的成绩，写成大字报，张贴出去；另外还画漫画、说快板、演短剧，这些东西都是根据本站的事实编写出来的。我们把木材股股长李振之盗卖木材洋灰的罪行，编成快板和画成漫画，使他看了触目惊心，对群众也起了很大的教育作用。
