    Zhengzhou Mayor Song Zhihe
    Self-Criticism on Restricting the Scope of the Anti-Bureaucracy Movement
    Editor: I sincerely accept the criticism from Comrade Xu Jin published in the People's Daily on February 5th regarding my "failure to restrict the scope of the anti-bureaucracy movement," as well as the editor's note. At the time, my understanding of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement was very poor. Subjectively, I wanted to guide the masses to focus on opposing bureaucracy as the breeding ground for corruption and waste, but I did not realize that this would limit the scope of the mass movement. Precisely because I had this subjective intention, when illegal capitalists made fallacious arguments to distort bureaucracy, attempting to shift the focus of the struggle and resist the movement, I did not refute them head-on. Instead, I still wanted to use "guidance" to alert others. As a result, not only did I fail to expose the fallacies of the illegal capitalists, but I also affected the full mobilization of the masses. Furthermore, due to the one-sidedness of my understanding, I still displayed an un-receptive attitude when listening to Comrade Xu Jin's criticism citing Comrade Bo Yibo's report. In addition, my understanding of the laws of this movement at that time was also very poor, and I also lacked sufficient understanding of the diverse forms of bureaucratic manifestation.
    The criticisms and corrections made by Comrade Xu Jin and the People's Daily editorial department have not only helped me improve my understanding but have also aroused great vigilance in me. In addition to expressing my gratitude, please continue to examine and criticize me in order to promote the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in Zhengzhou.

    郑州市市长宋致和
    对限制反官僚主义的范围的检讨
    编辑同志：二月五日人民日报上发表了徐进同志对我提出的“不该限制反官僚主义的范围”的批评和编辑部的有关按语，我诚恳地接受。当时，我对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的认识很差。在主观上，我是想诱导群众着重反对作为贪污浪费温床的官僚主义，但未认识到这样会限制群众运动的范围。正因为我有这个主观意图，所以当不法资本家发谬论曲解官僚主义，企图转移斗争目标、抵抗运动时，我还没有从正面予以驳斥，仍想用“诱导”的方法提起其他人们的警惕。结果不但没有揭穿不法资本家的谬论，反而影响到群众的充分发动。又因为我的认识的片面性，所以在听取徐进同志引证薄一波同志的报告进行批评时，我仍然表现了不虚心的态度。另外，当时我对这一运动的规律的认识也是很差的，当时我对官僚主义的表现形式的多样性，也是认识不足的。
    徐进同志和人民日报编辑部对我提出批评和指正之后，不但帮助我提高了认识，而且引起我很大的警惕。除表示感谢之外，请继续对我检查、批评，以期推进郑州市的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。
        郑州市市长  宋致和
