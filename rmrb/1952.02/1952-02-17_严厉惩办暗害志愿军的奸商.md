The facts that some unscrupulous merchants in Wuhan, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Shenyang and other places harmed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army undeniably prove that these unscrupulous merchants are not only frantically undermining our country's economic construction, but are also, in essence, cooperating with the American aggressors to launch a frenzied attack on the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. They stretched out their sinful, bloody hands, firing countless poisonous cold arrows from behind the Volunteer Army's lines and setting up all kinds of traps. They have already killed many Volunteer Army warriors whom the American imperialists could not kill. They are enemies of the People's Volunteer Army, traitors to the motherland, destroyers of world peace, and accomplices of American imperialism. In the struggle against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, shoddy work and the use of inferior materials, and theft of national economic intelligence, we must expose all these shameless murderers and thoroughly eliminate them.

These unscrupulous merchants are carrying out the sinful act of harming the Volunteer Army without restraint, which no patriotic Chinese can tolerate. Everyone knows that the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea to fight in order to defend the security of the motherland, defend world peace, and aid the Korean people who were brutally ravaged by American imperialists. They are not afraid of all hardships and sacrifices, fighting heroically and advancing wave upon wave, and have already defeated the American invaders, defending the security of the motherland and the happy lives of hundreds of millions of people. In the fierce battle environment, they cherish the motherland's materials more than their own lives. They save on heating costs while eating in the wind and sleeping in the open in the severe cold of minus thirty or forty degrees; they jump into the river full of large ice floes to rescue the timber washed away by the water used to build the Jiangqiao Bridge; they believe that caring for the motherland's materials is their bounden duty. They said: "These things do not come easily, they are produced by the blood and sweat of the people of the motherland." Which conscientious and passionate person can fail to be moved by the noble qualities of the Volunteer Army? The broad masses of the Chinese people call the Volunteer Army "the most beloved people," but the unscrupulous merchants regard the Volunteer Army, who are respected by everyone, as the object of their insidious harm. They picked up rotten cotton from corpses and garbage dumps and made "emergency kits" containing a large number of pyogenic and tetanus bacteria, selling them to the Volunteer Army at high prices, causing many Volunteer Army soldiers who were wounded for the country to become disabled when they should not have been, and to sacrifice when they should not have. They cheated the Volunteer Army out of their drug purchase funds and turned them into speculative businesses, while suppressing the urgently needed medicines ordered by the Volunteer Army, causing the Volunteer Army's wounded and sick to suffer great pain and unnecessary sacrifices. They sold unusable auto parts to the Volunteer Army, causing serious damage to the Volunteer Army's automobile transportation. They used bad beef to make canned food, moldy flour to make biscuits, and bad eggs to make egg powder, and mixed sand into pickles, selling them to the Volunteer Army at high prices, causing the Volunteer Army to be unable to eat their fill, and even causing poisoning and illness. These unscrupulous merchants fattened themselves with the blood of the Volunteer Army, and gained hundreds of millions of yuan in ill-gotten gains in almost unbelievable robber-style transactions. These unscrupulous merchants are simply wolves in human skin, who can tolerate them continuing to run rampant in human society?

These unscrupulous merchants are not only harming the People's Volunteer Army who are fighting bloody battles on the front lines, but also undermining the tremendous efforts of the people of the whole country to support the Volunteer Army. Everyone knows that in order to support their "most beloved people," the Chinese people, in the booming movement to resist America and aid Korea and defend their homes and the country, under the slogan of "shedding one more drop of sweat in the rear is equivalent to shedding one less drop of blood in the front," supported the front while carrying out economic construction, tightening their belts, working hard to produce, and enthusiastically donating airplanes and cannons. Many workers voluntarily carried out voluntary labor on holidays and donated all the proceeds from increased production to the Volunteer Army. Countless patriotic people not only donated a large amount of money and materials, but also donated precious blood. In Guisui alone, 500 young people collectively donated 10,000 cc of blood to save the wounded soldiers of the Volunteer Army. However, in the peaceful environment won by the Volunteer Army with blood and flesh, unscrupulous merchants lived a life of idleness and shamelessness. In the name of "Resisting America and Aiding Korea," they forced workers to work overtime and pocketed all the value of the workers' increased production; they accepted a large number of processing orders from the state, and took advantage of the urgent need for military supplies to steal labor and materials by means of robbery and deception, and made huge profits. Is there any similarity between what they have done and the working people of the whole country?

These unscrupulous merchants have not only become enemies of the People's Volunteer Army and traitors to the motherland, but in essence, they have also become vicious destroyers of world peace. Everyone knows that peace-loving people all over the world are supporting with unparalleled enthusiasm the just war waged by the Chinese People's Volunteer Army and the Korean People's Army to defend the Far East and world peace. Soviet medicines and leather boots, Polish sugar, thread velvet from the German Democratic Republic, clothes from Czechoslovakia, hospital equipment from Hungary, grain from Romania, and ambulances and disinfection vehicles from Bulgaria have been successively sent from distant Europe to the hands of the Chinese and Korean people's fighters on the Korean front. However, some unscrupulous merchants in our country are unwilling to conduct even the most basic fair transactions with the People's Volunteer Army! Isn't this the most obvious contrast? Every just person has the right to accuse these unscrupulous merchants of being accomplices of American imperialism. Because American imperialism has tried all day long to kill our Volunteer Army with airplanes and cannons but failed to achieve its goal, while the unscrupulous merchants have used shameless and insidious means to take the lives of many of our Volunteer Army warriors. Wang Qingyou, a combat hero of the Volunteer Army, said indignantly: "American imperialism wanted to kill us, but it did not succeed, but the unscrupulous merchants secretly harmed many of our comrades behind our backs. These unscrupulous merchants who have lost all conscience and reason are no different from American imperialism." This angry cry represents the Volunteer Army's righteous accusation against the unscrupulous merchants. All just people should quickly stand up, accept the Volunteer Army's accusations against the unscrupulous merchants, and resolutely demand that the People's Government severely punish these unscrupulous merchants who have lost all conscience and reason. We must never tolerate American imperialism attacking our Volunteer Army from the front, while the unscrupulous merchants are releasing cold arrows from behind. Who can bear to see "our most beloved people" in such a situation where they are attacked from both sides?

In the great struggle against corruption and theft that is taking place across the country, we should fully see the reactionary nature of the unscrupulous merchants. They are profit-seeking and self-serving, and have reached the most dangerous point of betraying the country, helping the enemy, and harming the world. All people who love the motherland and love peace must unite, defend our great motherland, defend the victory and peace we have won with blood, defeat the bourgeoisie's frenzied attack, and punish those unscrupulous merchants who endanger the interests of the country and the nation.

    严厉惩办暗害志愿军的奸商
    武汉、上海、北京、天津、济南、沈阳等地的一些奸商暗害中国人民志愿军的事实，无可置辩地证明了不法奸商不但在疯狂地破坏着我们祖国的经济建设，而且正在实质上配合着美国侵略者，向中国人民志愿军猖狂地进攻。他们伸出罪恶的血手，在志愿军的阵线后面，放出无数支恶毒的冷箭，布置了各种各样的陷阱，他们已经杀害了许许多多美帝国主义者所不能杀害的志愿军勇士。他们是人民志愿军的敌人，是祖国的叛徒，是世界和平的破坏者，是美帝国主义的帮凶。在反对行贿、反对偷税漏税、反对盗窃国家资财、反对偷工减料、反对盗窃国家经济情报的斗争中，我们必须把这些进行无耻暗害的凶手全部检举出来，彻底加以肃清。
    这些奸商肆无忌惮地干着暗害志愿军的罪恶勾当，是每一个有爱国心的中国人所决不能容忍的。谁都知道，中国人民志愿军是为了保卫祖国的安全、保卫世界的和平、援助被美帝国主义者横暴摧残的朝鲜人民，而进入朝鲜作战的。他们不怕一切艰苦和牺牲，前仆后继地英勇战斗，已经打败了美国侵略者，捍卫了祖国的安全和亿万人民的幸福生活。他们在激烈的战斗环境中，对于祖国的物资，比对自己的生命还要珍惜。他们在零下三、四十度的严寒中餐风宿露，还把烤火费节省下来；他们跳入浮着大块冰凌的江水中，抢救被水冲走的修造江桥的木材；他们认为爱护祖国的物资，是自己的天职。他们说：“这些东西来得不容易，这是祖国人民一滴血一滴汗给我们生产的。”那一个有良心有血性的人，能够不为志愿军的高贵品质所感动呢？我国广大人民都把志愿军称作“最可爱的人”，而奸商们却把人人尊敬的志愿军，作为自己暗害的对象。他们从尸体上和垃圾堆里拾取腐烂的棉花，作成含有大量化脓菌、破伤风菌的“救急包”，以高价卖给志愿军，使许多为祖国负伤的志愿军战士，不该残废的残废了，不该牺牲的牺牲了。他们骗得志愿军的购药货款，转作投机生意，而把志愿军订购的急需药品压下来，任令志愿军的伤病员遭受莫大的痛苦和不应有的牺牲。他们把不能用的汽车零件卖给志愿军，使志愿军的汽车运输遭受重大的破坏。他们用坏牛肉作成罐头，用发霉的面粉作成饼干，用坏鸡蛋作成蛋粉，在咸菜中搀入砂子，高价卖给志愿军，使志愿军不能吃饱吃好，甚至因而中毒致病。这些奸商用志愿军的鲜血喂肥了自己，他们在几乎使人不能置信的强盗式的交易中，获得了亿万元的暴利。这些奸商简直是狼心狗肺，谁能够容忍他们继续在人类的社会里横行呢？
    这些奸商不但暗害着在前线血战的人民志愿军，而且破坏着全国人民支援志愿军的巨大努力。谁都知道，我国人民为了支援自己的“最可爱的人”，在轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝保家卫国的运动中，在“后方多流一滴汗、前方少流一滴血”的口号下，一面支援前线，一面进行经济建设，节衣缩食，努力生产，踊跃捐献飞机大炮。许多工人自动地在假日实行义务劳动，把增产所得的款项，全部献给志愿军。无数爱国的人民不但捐出了大量的金钱和物资，而且献出了宝贵的鲜血，仅归绥五百个青年就集体输血一万西西，去救治志愿军的伤员。但是不法奸商却在志愿军用血肉争来的和平环境中，过着不劳而食、荒淫无耻的生活。他们假“抗美援朝”之名，强迫工人加班加点，而将工人增产的价值全部攫为己有；他们接受了国家大批加工定货，竟乘军需紧急之际，用强夺软骗的办法，偷工减料，牟取暴利。他们的所作所为，难道和全国的劳动人民有丝毫相同之点么？
    这些奸商不但已经成为人民志愿军的敌人和祖国的叛徒，而且他们在实质上也已经变成了世界和平的凶恶的破坏者。谁都知道，全世界爱好和平的人民，都以无比的热情支援着中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军为保卫远东和世界和平所进行的正义战争。苏联的药品和皮靴、波兰的砂糖、德意志民主共和国的线绒、捷克斯洛伐克的衣服、匈牙利的医院设备、罗马尼亚的粮食、保加利亚的救护车和消毒汽车，陆续地从遥远的欧洲，送到了朝鲜前线的中朝人民战士的手里。但是我们国内的一些奸商对于人民志愿军却不肯进行最起码的公平交易！这不是一个最显明的对比么？每一个正义的人民都有权控告这些奸商是美帝国主义的帮凶。因为美帝国主义企图成天用飞机、大炮来杀害我们的志愿军都不能达到目的，而奸商们用了无耻暗害的手段，却夺去了我们的许多志愿军勇士们的生命。志愿军战斗英雄王庆有愤慨地说：“美帝国主义想杀害我们，没有成功，奸商却在背后暗害了我们的许多同志。这些伤天害理的奸商，和美帝国主义毫无分别。”这个愤怒的呼声代表了人民志愿军对于奸商的正义控诉。一切正义的人民应该赶快起来，接受志愿军对奸商的控诉，并坚决要求人民政府严惩这些伤天害理的奸商。我们决不能容忍美帝国主义从前面打我们的志愿军，而奸商又从后面放出冷箭。谁能够忍心看着“我们最可爱的人”处于这样腹背受敌的境地呢？
    在全国人民轰轰烈烈的反贪污和反盗窃的伟大斗争中，我们对于奸商的反动本质应该完全看清楚了他们唯利是图，损人利己，竟然已经达到了叛国助敌、伤天害理的最危险的地步了。一切爱祖国、爱和平的人民必须团结起来，保卫我们伟大的祖国，保卫我们用鲜血换来的胜利与和平，打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，惩办那些危害国家民族利益的奸商。
