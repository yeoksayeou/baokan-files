　　Li Xiuzhen, a loyal daughter of the Party and the people, and a nationally renowned labor model, recently shared several stories about her fight against corruption and waste. These events may seem simple, but they truly demonstrate her noble qualities as a Communist Party member who wholeheartedly serves the people, deeply cherishes state property, and bravely engages in struggle.

　　There was an accountant in the Pingyuan Provincial Consultative Committee named Cao Kegong. He earned 125,000 yuan per month, and besides his own food and smoking expenses, he also supported his wife, who did not work. His daily life was also very extravagant: drinking, eating noodles, and buying candy were common occurrences. Last year, he bought four sets of unlined clothes for his wife and another set for a relative, and he made several poplin shirts for himself. In his conversations, he often displayed his "generosity" and wealth. Once, when he was about to send his wife to the hospital to give birth, someone asked him if he could afford it. Cao said, "Staying for ten or twenty days will only cost a few hundred thousand yuan!"

　　These things caught Li Xiuzhen's attention last summer. She thought: "He earns 125,000 yuan a month, so why is he so extravagant and wasteful? There must be corruption involved!" The revolution had just succeeded, and the people's lives were still very hard. In Pingyuan Province alone, there were three million disaster victims. In addition, the country needed to be built, and the front lines needed to be supported. If a corrupt element steals 100 yuan, the country will have 100 yuan less. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that it was intolerable and that she could not remain silent. So, she decided to get to the bottom of things. At first, she reported Cao Kegong's situation to Section Chief Yang and Secretary-General Zhao of the Provincial Consultative Committee. Because they did not pay attention, she later mentioned it to Kong Baichuan of the Administrative Office of the Provincial People's Government, but this also did not draw attention to Cao. In this situation, where no one paid attention to the matter, Li Xiuzhen felt that her strength was somewhat weak. But she still did not lose heart, because she believed that truth would ultimately triumph over error. Later, she found Liu Yanchun, Minister of the Organization Department of the CCP Pingyuan Provincial Committee, and former Provincial Party Secretary Wu De. Comrade Wu De thought that what she was doing was correct and encouraged her: "Yes, we must get the problem clear!" He immediately suspended Cao Kegong's work and ordered an audit of his accounts. Preliminary investigations of the accounts revealed that Cao Kegong had embezzled approximately 1.1 million yuan in train tickets, meal tickets, and family relief grain. He even embezzled the 30,000 yuan that comrades of the Provincial Consultative Committee had donated for the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. Cao Kegong also cunningly denied and refused to confess. He was later expelled from the Party and handed over to the People's Court for legal action in October of last year.

　　In the process of Li Xiuzhen's struggle with the corrupt elements, in addition to some comrades adopting a cold attitude towards her, there were also people who "kindly" dissuaded her, saying things like, "It's not good to do this, it will affect the unity of cadres," and so on. But these erroneous arguments did not weaken her fighting will. She said, "No matter what others say, I know what I'm doing. As long as I stand firm on the class stand, right and wrong will always be distinguished." Therefore, she explained to those who tried to dissuade her: "Chairman Mao said that to have unity, there must be criticism. If we can't even distinguish right from wrong, how can we talk about unity? At the same time, this is not good for him [Cao]. It's like being sick; if it's so bad that you can't get out of bed, it's difficult to treat." Cao Kegong also expressed dissatisfaction with Li Xiuzhen, but she did not compromise.

　　In August of last year, the Pingyuan Province convened the Second Consultative Committee, with more than 80 people attending. In three days, 45 cartons of cigarettes were smoked. This greatly surprised Li Xiuzhen. So, she suggested to the responsible comrades: "For all meetings, the amount of cigarettes used must be checked. For usual receptions, whoever needs cigarettes must have a slip to get them." The responsible comrades adopted her suggestion, and the wasteful phenomenon of taking and using cigarettes randomly was avoided afterward. In October, the Pingyuan Provincial Consultative Committee convened a joint meeting of the standing committee members of the county consultative committees and labor model representatives, with more than 50 people in total. In five days of meetings, only 18 cartons of cigarettes were used. Sometimes after the meeting, Li Xiuzhen would collect the leftover cigarettes on the table and put them in the box. She believed: "Small units of a dozen or so people must save from these things."

　　Li Xiuzhen usually maintains her class character of hard work and simplicity. She said, "I must never let the dirty things of the bourgeoisie contaminate me." When she had to spend money, she would try her best to save. Once, because her husband was old and sick, she went home to visit him. Others bought her a bus ticket, but she thought it was too expensive. When she returned, she took a charcoal open-top truck, saving half the money. In late October of last year, she went to Beijing to attend the Third Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During the conference, she mostly walked when she had to go to other agencies for business. She only brought a pair of cotton pants when she went to Beijing for the meeting. The meeting's reception department prepared cotton clothes for the members who did not bring them, and she repeatedly declined their kind offers to wear them. Her daughter-in-law and a young granddaughter lived with her. In order not to increase the burden on the people, she had her daughter-in-law work as a nanny for others to support herself. The higher authorities had approved her to eat small-灶 [special meals for high-ranking cadres] long ago to take care of Li Xiuzhen's old age and weakness, but she refused. Later, only after repeated persuasion did she change from large-灶 [general meals] to middle-灶 [meals for middle-ranking cadres] two months ago.

　　Two years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteers fought in the icy and snowy conditions, living a hard life of eating fried flour mixed with snowflakes. These things were deeply imprinted in Li Xiuzhen's heart. When the delegation to North Korea reported on what they saw and heard in Korea to Pingyuan Province, she was moved to tears and exclaimed: "The front is so bitter, how can we in the rear covet enjoyment and extravagance and waste!" She also often thought of her childhood hardships: "In good years, we ate thick porridge, and in bad years, we drank 'double-person head' [thin vegetable soup so thin you could see your reflection]." She often said: "When the lives of the people of the whole country are improved, our lives will naturally improve. The lives of the people of the whole country are not yet prosperous, so we must never covet enjoyment, otherwise we will be 'forgetting our roots'."

    党和人民的忠实女儿李秀真怎样向贪污浪费现象作斗争  
    黄友兰
    党和人民的忠实女儿、全国知名的劳动模范李秀真，最近谈了几段和贪污浪费现象作斗争的故事。事情看来似乎简单，但确实表现了她热诚为人民服务，高度爱护国家财产，大胆进行斗争的共产党员的高贵品质。
    平原省协商委员会有个会计叫曹克功。他每月薪金十二万五千元，除食用吸烟以外，还养活着不劳而食的老婆。平日生活又很奢侈：喝酒、吃挂面、买糖是常事。去年给他老婆买了四套单衣，又给亲戚买了一套，他自己作了几件府绸衬裤。平时在言谈中，也表示了他的“大方”、有钱。一次要送他老婆到医院去生孩子，别人问他住得起吗？曹说：“住个十天二十天，才花几十万元！”
    这些事，在去年夏季引起了李秀真的注意。她想：一个月收入十二万五千元，他为啥还能这样铺张浪费？这里边一定有贪污行为！革命刚刚胜利，人民的生活还很苦，单拿平原省来说，还有三百万灾民；另外国家需要建设，又要支援前线。如果被贪污分子盗去一百元，国家就少一百元。她越想越觉得不能容忍，不能缄默。他于是下定决心要把事情弄明白。开始时，她把曹克功的情形反映给省协商委员会的杨科长和赵秘书长；因为他们没有重视，后来她又和省人民政府行政处孔百川提到这事，也没有引起对曹的注意。在这种无人理睬这事的情况下，李秀真感到自己力量有些单薄；但她仍旧没有灰心。因为她认为真理终会战胜错误的。后来她找到中共平原省委组织部刘宴春部长和前省委书记吴德同志。吴德同志认为她这样作是正确的，并给她以鼓励：“对，必须把问题弄清楚！”于是立即停止了曹克功的工作，清查他的账目。仅从账目中初步查到曹克功贪污车票、饭票及家属救济粮等约一百一十多万元；他甚至连省协商委员会同志为抗美援朝捐献的三万元也贪污了。曹克功还狡猾抵赖，拒不坦白。后被开除党籍，并在去年十月送交人民法院法办。
    在李秀真和贪污分子斗争的过程中，除某些同志对她采取了冷淡的态度外，还有人向她“善意”地进行劝阻，说什么“这样搞不好，会影响干部团结”等等。但这些错误论调，没有减弱了她的斗争意志。她说：“别人无论怎样说，我心中有数。只要阶级立场站稳，是非总会划清。”因此，她向劝阻的人解释：“毛主席说，要团结就要有批评，如果连是非都搞不清楚，还说得上什么团结；同时这样对他（指曹）也没有好处，就像生病一样，重到起不得床，就难治了。”曹克功也曾对李秀真表示不满，但她也没有妥协。
    去年八月，平原省召开第二次协商委员会，到会八十多人，三天时间吸烟四十五条。这使李秀真十分吃惊。于是她就向负责同志提出：凡开会议，用烟必须检查用量；平常招待，无论何人必须开条才能领烟。负责同志采纳了她的意见，以后就避免了乱取乱用纸烟的浪费现象。十月间，平原省协商委员会又召开县协商委员会常务委员和劳动模范代表联席会，共五十多个人，开会五天，仅用烟十八条。有时在会后，李秀真还把桌面上的零烟收拾起来装到盒里。她认为：“十多个人的小单位，必须从这些地方节约才行。”
    李秀真平时仍然保持着艰苦朴素的阶级本色。她说：“我万万不能让资产阶级的脏东西沾染上我。”在她非用钱不可时，也都是极力节约。一次因丈夫年老多病，她回家探望。别人给她买了客车的汽车票，她就觉得太贵。回来时，自己改乘木炭敞车，省去一半的钱。去年十月下旬，她到北京参加人民政协全国委员会第三次会议，在会议期间因事到其他机关去，多是步行。她去北京开会时，只带了条棉裤。会议招待部门给没带棉衣的委员筹备了棉衣，别人再三劝她穿一身，都被她婉言谢绝了。他儿媳妇和一个小孙女和她在一起住。为了不增加人民的负担，她就让儿媳妇给别人当褓姆，自食其力。上级为照顾李秀真年高体衰，早就批准她吃小灶，但她不肯。后来在别人再三劝说下，才在两月前由大灶改吃中灶。
    前年，中国人民志愿军在冰天雪地中作战，过着吃炒面拌雪花的艰苦生活，这些事情深印在李秀真的心里。当赴朝慰问团到平原省报告朝鲜见闻时，她感动得热泪交流，感叹地说：“前方这么苦，咱们怎能在后方贪图享受和奢侈浪费呢！”她也时时想起自己幼年时的困苦情形：“好年月吃稠糊粥，坏年月喝双人头（稀菜汤能照人影）。”她常说：“全国人民生活提高了，咱们的生活自然会提高；全国人民生活目前还不富裕，咱们决不能贪图享受，不然就是‘忘本’了。”
