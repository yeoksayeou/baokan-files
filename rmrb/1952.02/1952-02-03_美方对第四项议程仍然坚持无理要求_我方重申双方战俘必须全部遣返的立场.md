    Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 2nd: During the third agenda item staff meeting of the Korean armistice negotiations on February 2nd, both sides once again reviewed all the clauses in the draft armistice agreement related to the second and third agenda items, and resolved several previously divergent points on details. Both sides agreed to continue to negotiate and resolve the remaining differences between the two sides at the meeting on February 3rd.

    In the subcommittee on the fourth agenda item, because the other side continued to insist unreasonably on demanding so-called "guarantees" regarding the principle of both sides assisting displaced civilians to return to their hometowns after the armistice, our side's representatives continued to refute them, and pointed out: "The fourth agenda item subcommittee has held fifty-one meetings, and no agreement has yet been reached on the principle of releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war. The main obstacle is your side's unreasonable insistence on such claims as 'voluntary repatriation,' 'exchange of equal numbers,' civilians substituted for prisoners of war, illegally classifying prisoners of war as civilians, and unilateral declarations. If your side does not abandon these unreasonable demands, this agenda item still cannot be resolved. After such a long period of discussion, I believe that you fully understand our side's firm position. After the armistice agreement is signed and comes into effect, the unconditional release and repatriation of all prisoners of war on both sides is both the inalienable right of all prisoners of war and an obligation that both belligerent parties must fulfill. No excuse or fine-sounding phrase can evade the execution of such an obligation. Therefore, I once again sincerely urge your side to seriously consider and change your position, and put forward constructive opinions."

    美方对第四项议程仍然坚持无理要求  
    我方重申双方战俘必须全部遣返的立场
    【新华社开城二日电】二月二日朝鲜停战谈判第三项议程参谋会议中，双方再次检阅了停战协定草案中有关第二项与第三项议程的全部条款，并解决了若干细节上原有意见分歧之点，双方同意在二月三日的会议上继续协商解决双方分歧的其余部分。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，由于对方仍然无理地坚持要求，对停战后双方协助流离失所的平民返乡的原则，要求所谓“保证”，我方代表继续予以驳斥，并指出：“第四项议程小组委员会已开了五十一次会，在释放并遣返全部战俘的原则问题上尚未达成任何协议，主要的障碍是你方无理坚持‘志愿遣返’、‘同等数目交换’、平民顶战俘、非法地将战俘分类为平民以及片面的宣誓等主张。如果你方不放弃这些不合理的要求，这项议程依然是不能解决的。经过这样长时期的讨论，我相信你对我方的坚定立场是充分理解的。停战协议签字并生效后，无条件释放与遣返双方全部战俘既是全体战俘的不可剥夺的权利，也属交战双方必须履行的义务。以任何藉口或假借任何好听的词句，都不能逃避这样一个义务的执行。因此我再度诚恳地促请你方严重地考虑并改变你方立场，而提出有建设性的意见来”。
