    Relevant Departments Should Investigate the Work of Xiang County Trading Company in Guangxi Province

    Editor: The Xiang County Trading Company in Guangxi Province has revealed extremely chaotic phenomena during the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. The company manages nine units of various sizes, with more than eighty cadres. In these units, not a single set of books is complete; the company's transfer orders are also incomplete; and there is no price list register. The original vouchers (receipts) are a mess, incomplete, and most of them only have fingerprints on them (some receipts worth tens of thousands or millions also have fingerprints), which creates opportunities for corruption and waste. Based on preliminary findings alone, the company's cadres have embezzled sixty to seventy million yuan. Serious corruption and waste are prevalent in every unit under this company. For example, the head of the Luoxiu Purchasing and Marketing Group arbitrarily misappropriated public funds. According to him, he has lost count of the number of times he misappropriated amounts under ten thousand yuan. Other cadres in the group also casually consumed public rice, oil, salt, and other goods. The Temple Village Purchasing and Marketing Group reported losses for 130 million catties of medicinal materials acquired because these "medicinal materials" were actually just grass and tree roots.

    The company's detachment from the masses is also very serious. For example, the Dale District of Xiang County is a rice-producing area, and the local people requested that the company purchase grain in Dale to avoid being manipulated and exploited by unscrupulous merchants. However, You Cheng-zhang, the manager of this company, paid no attention to the people's demands and even emphasized objective difficulties. In September and October of last year, a large amount of cloth was needed in rural areas, but the company did not actively try to supply it. By the time a portion was shipped in at the end of the year, the farmers could no longer afford to buy it. The company's cloth prices were even 5 to 10 percent higher than those of private merchants.

    When Xiang County conducted the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement study, You Cheng-zhang took a resistant attitude. The masses raised more than eighty comments about You Cheng-zhang, but he ignored them and threatened the masses, saying, "I was sent by Commissioner Meng from the Special District and introduced by County Chief Cui." His egregious attitude has aroused the resentment and dissatisfaction of the broad masses. I believe that the problems of the Xiang County Trading Company are very serious, and relevant departments should thoroughly investigate their work.

### 有关部门应检查广西省象县贸易公司的工作

    有关部门应检查广西省象县贸易公司的工作
    编辑同志：广西省象县贸易公司在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，暴露出极端混乱的现象。该公司管辖大小九个单位，干部有八十多人。在这些单位中，没有一个单位的账簿是完整的；公司的调货单也不完全；也没有牌价登记簿。原始凭证
    （单据）乱七八糟，残缺不全，而且大多数都只按手印（有的单据几十万几百万也按手印），因而给贪污浪费造成了机会。只从初步发现的数字看，该公司的干部就贪污了六七千万元。这个公司所属的每个单位，都普遍存在着严重的贪污浪费现象。如罗秀购销组的组长，随意挪用公款，据他自己说，挪用一万元以下的款子已经记不清有多少次了。该组的其他干部还随便吃公家的米、油、盐等物。寺村购销组收购的药材一亿数千万斤，完全报了损失，因为这些“药材”，实际上是一些草和树根子。
    这个公司脱离群众的现象也十分严重。如象县大乐区是产米区，当地群众曾要求公司到大乐收购谷米，以免被奸商操纵，从中剥削。但这个公司的经理游成章对群众的要求毫不在意，还强调客观困难。去年九、十月份，农村需要大量布匹，但公司并不积极设法供应。直到年底运来一部分时，农民却已无力购买了。该公司的布价甚至比私商还贵出百分之五到百分之十。
    象县进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动学习时，游成章竟抱着抵抗态度。群众对游成章提出了八十多条意见，他置之不理，并威胁群众说：“我是专区孟专员派来的，是崔县长介绍来的”。他这种恶劣的态度，已经引起广大群众的愤恨和不满。我认为象县贸易公司的问题是十分严重的，有关部门应彻底检查他们的工作。
    广西省象县人民银行副行长  许家鼐
