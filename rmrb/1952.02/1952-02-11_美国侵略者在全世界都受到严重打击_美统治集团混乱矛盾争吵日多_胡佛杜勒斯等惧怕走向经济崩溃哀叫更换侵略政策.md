Xinhua News Agency, February 9th: Former U.S. President Herbert Hoover's speech on January 27th, which fiercely attacked the Truman administration's current policies, indicates that the contradictions within the U.S. ruling clique, which erupted after the failure of the Korean War, are further developing. A growing number of people within the U.S. ruling group have seen the fact that American aggressors have suffered severe blows on all fronts worldwide in the past year and cannot but admit that there is a fundamental contradiction in the U.S.'s imperialist cause that cannot be resolved, that is, the U.S.'s aggression plan is so vast, but its aggressive power is so fragile, just as the old henchman of the Morgan consortium, 82-year-old Baruch, said in "Outlook" magazine published on December 18th last year, the U.S.'s difficulty is: "Too much to do, and too little to do it with." Therefore, they are increasingly afraid that Truman and Acheson's attempt to establish so-called "situations of strength" "total diplomacy" everywhere in the world will never achieve its purpose and will only lead to the collapse of the U.S.'s own national strength. Therefore, they are increasingly advocating that the U.S.'s current aggressive policy should be tactically modified and replaced by an aggressive policy that they believe the U.S.'s power seems capable of supporting.

As early as a year ago (December 20, 1950), when the U.S. war of aggression against Korea was already doomed to failure, Hoover gave a speech requesting that the U.S.'s aggressive forces be withdrawn from the Eurasian continent and that the U.S.'s "borders" be defined as Japan and the Philippines in the west and the British Isles in the east; he called for the establishment of "powerful" naval and air attack forces to replace the army that the Truman administration attempted to establish under such names as "North Atlantic Alliance," "Pacific Alliance," and "Middle East Command" to carry out the U.S.'s aggression plan. Because, in Hoover's view, "for the armies of non-communist countries to fight against the large communist armies on land will certainly be a war with no hope of victory."

Hoover's speech caused a great shock within the U.S. ruling clique at the time. It triggered an unprecedented "great debate" on foreign policy in American history, which lasted for several months in the United States. The Truman administration exhausted its efforts to refute Hoover's theory and maintain its original foreign policy. After Hoover's speech, the Truman administration instructed its senior strategist, another Republican leader, Dulles, to refute it strictly, believing that Hoover's proposal "contained the seeds of its own collapse." However, a year later, the fundamental weakness of the U.S.'s insufficient aggressive power was finally recognized even by people like Dulles. On November 27th last year, when Dulles gave a speech at the Detroit Advertising Association meeting, he changed his past tone and openly admitted that the borders of the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies were 25,000 miles long. If the U.S. attacks everywhere, it will inevitably fail everywhere, making the "free world (referring to imperialism) have no real power anywhere and go bankrupt everywhere." In this way, he actually agreed with Hoover's opinion that the U.S. should devote all its efforts to building a powerful naval and air aggressive force and loudly appealed: "Let the free world unite to build a powerful attack force, and then increasingly rely on the power of this force that punishes aggressors (should be read as forces that carry out aggression), and rely less and less on a series of local defenses (should be read as aggression)."

A month later, a report from Washington by the United Press on December 29th last year revealed: "There are signs that the U.S. may have to make some degree of change in its strategy of suppressing the expansion of communism in Europe and the Far East (should be read as preventing the people's liberation movement) in 1952. Some influential figures in the Republican and Democratic parties increasingly believe that the current policy of supporting the defenses of all countries around the Soviet sphere of influence (should be read as arms expansion and war preparation measures) may eventually lead the U.S. government to bankruptcy. They are beginning to seriously consider whether it is appropriate to change to a policy of building new powerful 'forces to suppress the enemy' (should be read as concentrated aggressive forces)." The United Press pointed out: "So far, the most powerful advocate of the theory of 'suppressing the enemy' is Dulles, the Republican adviser to the State Department."

According to the United Press analysis, the reason why people in this part of the U.S. ruling group, represented by Dulles, want to "seriously consider" changing their strategy is that: the signs of the U.S.'s economic collapse have become increasingly obvious, the U.S. people's resistance has become increasingly stronger, and the Western European countries, on which the U.S. relies most deeply in realizing its war plan, have become increasingly weak under the blows of their own economic and political crises. The United Press said: "Why are more and more people agreeing with this theory of 'suppressing the enemy' to prevent communism? The most frequently mentioned reasons are as follows: First, many U.S. congressmen are deeply anxious about whether the U.S. economy has the ability to bear the heavy burden of a military budget of 60 to 70 billion U.S. dollars per year in the coming years. Second, next year (referring to this year) is an election year. A few months before the scheduled election, the general public in the United States has felt the full pressure of lack of consumption and increased taxes, and politicians are beginning to worry about how they will react. Third, it has recently been revealed that the European contracting parties of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are even unable to maintain the current amount of military spending. This news strengthens the belief that the current method of defending against communism is not the best method."

The United Press revealed: Washington diplomatic observers believe that "the matter of demanding a change in the U.S.'s strategy for dealing with communism should not be ignored." "Dulles's 'suppressing the enemy' policy, which is quietly, but firmly and strongly advocated, is very important because he has great influence in both the Democratic and Republican parties." Dulles himself said: "Some congressmen who have a decisive influence on passing U.S. military spending have increasingly accepted my opinion." According to the estimation of "experienced diplomatic observers," the U.S.'s "extremely critical economic situation" can also enable him to gain more support.

The serious depression and contradictions within the U.S. ruling group caused by the setbacks in the aggressive policy revealed by the United Press have been increasingly exposed in the speeches of American political figures and newspapers and magazines in recent months. On December 4th last year, Ralph J. Cordiner, one of the largest monopolists in the United States and chairman of General Electric, publicly advocated at the New York International Manufacturers Conference that the U.S.'s highest military expansion target for 1953 should be reduced to 55 billion U.S. dollars, and the original military expansion plan should be extended by two to four years to complete. He also advocated that other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should also make the same modifications. He told 360 top monopolists in the United States and Western Europe: "The peak of the rearmament plan is set too high and coming too fast. If military needs cannot be reduced without affecting security, this plan must be modified in terms of time limits." He believed that this was necessary to avoid "serious economic and political disturbances" in the North Atlantic Treaty countries. He said: "The danger caused by new inflation is no less serious than" the so-called "Soviet aggression," "or even more serious." According to the "New York Times," when Cordiner said these words, "the audience warmly applauded to express their approval." Shortly after Cordiner's speech, Wilson, the former general manager of United Aircraft Corporation (one of the largest aircraft companies in the United States), also issued a memorandum in Washington, which emphasized that the path the United States is currently taking is the path of "national suicide." He said: "The rise in military spending has become the source of military weakness. The heavy burden of military spending was already dangerous before the Korean War, and now it is unsustainable, but the result is still unknown. Military spending is no longer a secondary influence on the economy, but a factor that determines national security. Unless we control it immediately, we will surely move towards national suicide." On December 27th last year, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Kennedy delivered a speech in Chicago, lamenting the deep crisis in U.S. foreign policy. After admitting that the U.S.'s war preparation plan in Western Europe has failed and that it has "caused inflation, devaluation of the dollar, and unprecedented rise in prices" at home, he openly demanded: "We should try to get rid of the broad obligations we have undertaken."

The "Wall Street Journal" wrote in commenting on Kennedy's speech: "Kennedy is just a pragmatic realist. We need more realists inside and outside the government, and then we may get pragmatic realist policies."

"Fortune" magazine, which represents large American enterprises, reviewed the severe economic crisis of the entire North Atlantic Group in its December issue editorial last year, admitting that "all countries in the North Atlantic Treaty have some form of difficulty," and proposed: "The United States will inevitably reduce the scale of the entire military expansion plan of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, including its own plan that is far behind the original target." The American "Outlook" magazine, published on January 1st this year, published an article written by Crowther, the chief writer of the British "Economist" weekly. The title of this article sharply raised a question: "Are we spending money to strengthen defense, or are we buying disaster?" It expressed great fear that the military expansion plan of the North Atlantic Group "would go too far," which would damage the economies of the war-preparing countries, making them actually weaker than before the war preparation.

All these worried remarks prove that a large part of the U.S. ruling group is aware that the current Truman-Acheson policy is too dangerous, and the goal of this policy to attempt to restore capitalism throughout the world is clearly unattainable. The "Wall Street Journal," representing this part of the people, wrote: "Some people think that the government's policy always has the risk of gambling and may lose. This view is agreeable. However, what we see seems like playing roulette. The gambler who insists on not leaving the game is destined to commit suicide sooner or later."

It was precisely in the face of this strong undercurrent of opposition that Truman had to complain angrily when he presented his "State of the Union Address" at the beginning of this year: "Every day we see a long line of timid and fearful people wringing their hands and shouting: We are lost, we don't know what we are doing, we will definitely fail." Therefore, Truman angrily shouted: "We must reject the opinions of failure and despair," "Now is the time to show courage, not to complain and mutter," "If we hesitate, we will fail," but despite this, the tone of his entire State of the Union Address was extremely low and empty. After Truman presented this address, Senator Republican leader Bridges severely criticized this address as just "a rehash of old political mishmash," "the government has exhausted its wisdom and strength." Six Republican congressmen in the House of Representatives also jointly issued a statement condemning the government for "not having a policy to solve international or domestic problems." Even the "Washington Post," which has always been pro-State Department, pointed out: Truman "made very few practical suggestions to Congress... Paying attention to reality is the primary principle that politicians must abide by, but this principle has been blatantly violated."

In this way, no matter how Truman calls for unity and morale, he cannot cover up the U.S. ruling group's bewilderment, loss of position, chaos, and contradictions. Now, this dissatisfaction and opposition to Truman's policy has become more apparent because of Hoover's newly published speech reiterating his past claims. Even when U.S. Secretary of State Acheson refuted Hoover's claims at a press conference, he could not but admit that "there are Americans who agree with Hoover in Congress and elsewhere." A United Press report on January 27th predicted when estimating the significance of Hoover's speech: "Hoover has reopened the 'great debate' on foreign policy that began a year ago." In fact, the struggle against the current aggressive strategy of the Truman administration has already begun in Congress's demand to cut the Truman administration's huge budget. After Truman submitted a new budget of astronomical figures of 85.4 billion U.S. dollars to Congress on January 21st, the voices of opposition have become louder day by day. There is no doubt that with the development of this year's presidential election struggle, the quarrels within the U.S. ruling group will definitely become more intense. However, the obvious fact is that all these quarrels can never find a way out for the United States, which attempts to continue to pursue imperialist goals. In late January, Henry Ford II, one of the top American monopolists and the automobile king, confessed in confusion when talking to reporters from "U.S. News & World Report" magazine:

"People in Washington seem to have different opinions. Obviously, we only have two places to go, one is war, and the other is bankruptcy." (Attached picture)

    美国侵略者在全世界都受到严重打击
    美统治集团混乱矛盾争吵日多
    胡佛杜勒斯等惧怕走向经济崩溃哀叫更换侵略政策
    【新华社九日讯】美国共和党首脑之一、前美国总统胡佛于一月二十七日发表的激烈攻击杜鲁门政府现行政策的演说，表明了美国统治集团内部在侵朝战争失败以后爆发出来的矛盾正在进一步发展。美国统治集团中越来越大的一部分人，在过去一年内看到了美国侵略者在全世界各个战线上都遭到严重打击的事实，已不能不承认在美国的帝国主义事业中存在着一个无法解决的根本矛盾，即美国的侵略计划如此庞大，而它的侵略力量却又如此脆弱，就像摩根财团的老狗腿，八十二岁的巴鲁区在去年十二月十八日出版的“展望”杂志上所说的那样，美国的困难是：“要做的事情太多，而能做的事情太少。”因此，他们就越来越害怕杜鲁门与艾奇逊企图在全世界到处建立所谓“有实力形势”的“总体外交”将永远不能达到目的，而只能导致美国本身国力的崩溃。又因此，他们越来越主张美国的现行侵略政策应该在策略上有所修改，而代之以他们认为美国力量似乎能够支持的侵略政策。
    早在一年以前（一九五○年十二月二十日），当美国侵朝战争败局已定之初，胡佛就曾发表了一篇演说，要求把美国的侵略力量撤出欧亚大陆，而把美国的“边界”西部定在日本与菲律宾，东部定在英伦三岛；要求建立“强大的”海空攻击部队，以代替杜鲁门政府企图在“北大西洋联盟”，“太平洋联盟”，“中东司令部”这类名目下成立的陆军来执行美国的侵略计划。因为，在胡佛看来，“以非共产党国家的陆军对共产党陆上的大军作战将一定是一个没有胜利希望的战争”。
    胡佛的演说当时曾在美国统治集团内部引起了极大的震动。它曾在美国激起了绵延好几个月的美国历史上空前的关于外交政策的“大辩论”，杜鲁门政府费尽气力，才驳覆了胡佛的理论而把原定的外交政策维持下来。在胡佛演说以后，杜鲁门政府曾指使其高级策士、共和党的另一首脑杜勒斯严予驳覆，认为胡佛的主张“本身就包含着自己崩溃的种子。”但是，事隔一年，美国侵略力量不足的根本弱点终于连杜勒斯这样的人也不能不认识到了。去年十一月二十七日，杜勒斯在底特律广告协会会议上发表演说时，竟一改过去的论调，而公开承认苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的边境长达二万五千英里，美国如果处处进攻，势必处处失败，会使“自由世界（指帝国主义）在任何地方都没有真正的力量，而在每一处地方都破产”。这样，他实际上同意了胡佛主张美国应以全力建立强大海空侵略部队的意见，而大声疾呼：“让自由世界联合起来建立一支强大的攻击部队，然后越来越多地依靠这支惩罚侵略者的部队（应读为进行侵略的部队）的威力，而越来越少地依靠一系列局部地区的防御（应读为侵略）。”
    一个月以后，合众社在去年十二月二十九日从华盛顿发出的一则消息中透露：“有迹象说明美国一九五二年可能不得不把它抑制共产主义在欧洲与远东扩张（应读为制止人民解放运动）的策略作某种程度的改变。共和党与民主党内一些有势力的人物越来越相信，目前支持一切苏联势力圈周围国家的防务（应读为扩军备战措施）的政策，可能使得美国政府最后趋于破产。他们正在开始郑重考虑更换一种建立新的强大的‘抑止敌人’的部队（应读为集中攻击的侵略力量）的政策是否适宜。”合众社指出：“迄今为止，主张‘抑止敌人’的理论最有力的是国务院共和党顾问杜勒斯。”
    据合众社分析，以杜勒斯为代表的这部分美国统治集团中的人所以要如此“郑重考虑”更换策略是因为：美国的经济崩溃的迹象已越来越明显，美国人民的反抗已越来越增强，而美国在实现其战争计划方面倚赖最深的西欧各国，则已在本身经济政治危机的打击下越来越孱弱。合众社说：“为什么有越来越多的人同意这个制止共产主义的‘抑止敌人’的理论呢？最常提出来的原因有下列几个：第一，许多美国议员对于美国经济是否有能力在今后几年来担负起每年六百亿到七百亿美元的军事预算的重负深感焦虑。第二，明年（指今年）是大选年，在预定举行选举以前不多几个月，美国一般人民已感到了消费的缺少和赋税增加的全部压力，政治家们开始担心他们会有什么反应。第三，最近透露，北大西洋公约组织的欧洲缔约国甚至无力维持目前的军费数额。这个消息加强了一个信念：即现行的防御共产主义的方法不是最好的办法。”
    合众社透露：华盛顿外交观察家认为：“要求改变美国对付共产主义的策略这一件事是不应该予以忽视的。”“杜勒斯悄悄地，然而是坚决地、强烈地倡导的‘抑止敌人’的政策是甚为重要的，因为他在民主党与共和党内都有很大的势力。”杜勒斯自己说：“一些在通过美国军费方面发言有举足轻重之影响的议员，已越来越接受我的意见。”而据“有经验的外交观察家”估计，美国“危急透顶的经济情况”还能使他得到更多的支持。
    合众社所透露的美国统治集团内部这种因侵略政策到处碰壁所引起的严重的苦闷与矛盾，在最近几个月来美国政界人物与报纸杂志的言论中，已经越来越大量地暴露出来。去年十二月四日，美国最大的垄断资本家之一、奇异电气公司董事长瑞德，在纽约国际制造商会议上就公开主张美国一九五三年的最高扩军目标应削减至五百五十亿美元，原定扩军计划应延长两年至四年完成。他并且主张北大西洋公约组织其他各国也作同样的修改。他对三百六十名美国与西欧的头等大垄断资本家说：“重整军备计划的高峰定得太高，而且来得太快了。假如不能减低军事方面的需要而不影响安全，这个计划便得在时限方面加以修改。”他认为这是为避免北大西洋公约国家发生“严重的经济和政治纷扰”所不得不做的。他说：“由新的通货膨胀所引起的危险，其严重程度决不下于”所谓“苏联侵略”的危险，“或者还会更严重些”。据“纽约时报”报道，当瑞德说到这些话时，“听众热烈鼓掌表示赞成”。瑞德演说以后不久，前联合飞机公司（美国最大的飞机公司之一）总经理威尔逊又在华盛顿发表一项备忘录，其中强调美国目前所走的道路是“国家自杀”的道路。他说：“军费的上升已成为军事弱点的根源。军费之苛重在朝鲜战争以前就已很危险，现在则无法支持了，可是结果还不知伊于胡底。军事的开支对经济说来已不再是次要的影响，而是决定国家安全的因素了。除非我们立即加以控制，否则我们一定会走向国家自杀。”去年十二月二十七日，美国前驻英大使肯尼第在芝加哥发表演说，痛悼美国外交政策的深重危机。他在承认美国在西欧的备战计划已告失败，而在国内则已“造成了通货膨胀、美元贬值与物价的空前高涨”以后，公开要求：“我们应该设法解脱我们所承担的广泛义务。”
    “华尔街杂志”在评论肯尼第演说时写道：“肯尼第不过是一个实事求是的现实主义者罢了，我们需要政府内外有更多的现实主义者，那到时我们也许会得到实事求是的现实主义的政策。”
    代表美国大企业的“幸福”杂志在去年十二月号的社论里检阅了整个北大西洋集团严重的经济危机，承认“所有北大西洋公约国家都有某种形式的困难”，并且提出：“美国必将缩减北大西洋公约组织整个扩军计划的规模，包括它本身落后于原定目标很远的计划在内。”今年一月一日出版的美国“展望”杂志登出了英国“经济学家”周刊主笔格劳塞所写的一篇文章，这篇文章的题目就尖锐地提出了一个问题：“我们是在花钱增强防御，还是在购买灾难？”它表示十分害怕北大西洋集团的扩军计划“会太过分”这样就会破坏备战国的经济，使它们结果实际上比备战前更为削弱。
    所有这一切忧心忡忡的言论，都证明了美国统治集团内已有很大一部分意识到现行的杜鲁门—艾奇逊政策是太危险了，这个政策妄想使资本主义在全世界复辟的目的显然是达不到的。作为这一部分人的代表的“华尔街日报”就写道：“有人认为，政府的政策总有冒险赌博而又可能输掉的因素，这种见解是可以同意的。不过我们所看到的，却好像在玩轮盘赌，坚持不肯下场的赌棍是注定了迟早要自杀的。”
    正是在这种强烈的反对的暗流面前，今年年初杜鲁门在提出其“国情咨文”时才不得不恼怒地抱怨：“每天我们都看到一长列胆怯和恐惧的人们，搓着手叫道：我们迷路了，我们不知道我们在做什么，我们一定会失败的。”因此，杜鲁门愤然叫嚷：“我们必须排斥失败和绝望的意见”，“现在是需要拿出勇气来的时候，不是抱怨和嘟囔的时候”，“如果我们踌躇犹豫，我们就会失败”，但是，尽管如此他的整个国情咨文的语调却极为低沉而空洞。在杜鲁门提出这篇咨文以后，参议院共和党领袖勃里奇就痛斥这篇咨文只是“重温了老一套的政治杂拌”，“政府已智尽力竭了”。众议院的六名共和党议员也联名发表声明谴责政府“并没有解决国际问题或者国内问题的政策”。甚至一向亲国务院的“华盛顿邮报”也指出：杜鲁门“对国会极少提出实际建议……。注意现实是政治家所要遵守的首要原则，但是这个原则被悍然破坏了。”
    这样，不论杜鲁门如何呼吁团结振作，他都无法掩盖美国统治集团的彷徨失据和混乱矛盾。而现在，对杜鲁门政策的这种不满与反对已因为胡佛新近发表的重申其过去主张的演说而趋于表面化了。即使美国国务卿艾奇逊在记者招待会上反驳胡佛的主张时，也不能不承认“在国会与其他地方有同意胡佛的美国人。”合众社一月二十七日电在估计胡佛演说的意义时预示：“胡佛已重新展开了一年前开始的外交政策‘大辩论’。”实际上，反对杜鲁门政府现行侵略策略的斗争已经在国会要求削减杜鲁门政府的庞大预算案上面展开。当杜鲁门在一月二十一日向国会提出了八百五十四亿美元的天文学数字的新预算以后，反对的呼声已一天响似一天。毫无疑问，随着今年总统竞选斗争的开展，美国统治集团内部的争吵，定然将更加激烈。但是，明显的事实是：所有这些争吵都决不能为企图继续追求帝国主义目的的美国找到出路。一月下旬，美国头等垄断资本家，汽车大王福特二世在向“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志的记者发表谈话时就曾惶惑地承认：
    “在华盛顿的人们，似乎人人都有不同的意见。显然，我们只有两个地方可去，一个是战争，另一个是破产。”（附图片）
