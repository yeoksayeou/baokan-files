    The Korean People's Army Has Become an Invincible and Powerful Force
    --Written to Commemorate the Fourth Anniversary of the Founding of the Korean People's Army
    Jin Xiong, Commander of the Front Lines of the Korean People's Army
    Our Korean People's Army welcomes the fourth anniversary of its founding in the environment of the great Fatherland Liberation War against the American aggressors and their lackeys who attempted to turn Korea into their colony. After enduring the painful life of a colony for a long period of nearly half a century, the Korean people, after being liberated by the great Soviet army, deeply realized that in order to defend the regime they had acquired and the achievements of various democratic reforms, to strive for the independence and unification of the motherland, and to protect their brilliant achievements gained through creative labor, it was necessary to establish an armed force that truly belonged to the people. The beastly American imperialist bandits occupied the southern half of our country and created various conspiracies in an attempt to annex the entire territory of our country, making the Korean people's demand for the establishment of an army even more urgent. Therefore, on February 8, 1948, the Korean people established the Korean People's Army—a strong fortress defending the motherland and a just people's armed force safeguarding the interests of the people and lasting world peace.

    I. Our People's Army Accumulates Rich Combat Experience

    The officers and soldiers of the People's Army, carrying out their noble mission and tasks, receive the infinite welcome and respect of all the people, follow the instructions of General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, and actively study Marxist-Leninist theory and modern military science and technology. The Korean People's Army inherited the revolutionary tradition of General Kim Il-sung's anti-Japanese guerrilla struggle and absorbed the valuable experience of the advanced Soviet army. Although our People's Army is young, it has been growing and strengthening on the basis of a modern regular army from the very first day of its birth. On June 25, 1950, American imperialism, the arch-criminal of the world's aggressive camp, instigated the traitorous Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) clique to launch an armed invasion against the northern half of our republic. Our People's Army fearlessly and calmly frustrated the enemy's offensive and then turned to counterattack, annihilating the enemy's main force. Three days after the start of the war, on June 28, the capital Seoul was liberated. Subsequently, the People's Army advanced southward with irresistible force. By the beginning of July, strategically important cities such as Suwon, Pyeongtaek, Icheon, Anseong, Wonju, Jecheon, Pyeongchang, and Samcheok had been liberated.

    When the American imperialists and the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) clique began their offensive towards North Korea, they dreamed of occupying Pyongyang and Wonsan in one fell swoop. But in fact, as General Bradley, Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, admitted: "No one thought North Korea would be as strong as it later proved to be. Based on our intelligence, we underestimated them."

    In order to salvage the situation from the disastrous defeat, Truman, the arch-criminal of aggression, ordered his army to directly participate in the Korean War on June 30, ordered his navy to step up the blockade of the Korean coast, and ordered a large number of his air force to bomb Pyongyang, Wonsan, and other places. On July 1, the US 24th Division appeared on the Osan battlefield. However, this did not intimidate the Korean People's Army, but only exposed the hideous aggressive face of American imperialism to the people of the world.

    Our heroic People's Army continued to advance, breaking through the enemy's Jinjiang defense line, which they boasted was an "iron wall," in one fell swoop on the western front. By July 20, Jochiwon, Cheongju, Gongju, and Daejeon were liberated; at the same time, most of the US 24th Division was annihilated, and the division commander, Dean, was captured alive. Around July 30, our frontal troops liberated key locations such as Yeongdong, Gimcheon, and Seongju. Our flanking troops liberated Gwangju, Mokpo, Yeosu, Jinju, Goseong, and Haman, threatening the enemy's retreat. In addition, our troops on the eastern front, in the same rhythm, made use of the favorable terrain in the mountainous areas to annihilate the remnants of the Li (Syngman Rhee) puppet army who were resisting desperately. Around July 30, important areas such as Mungyeong, Hamchang, Sangju, Yecheon, Andong, Ulsan, and Yeongdeok were liberated, and they advanced from the front towards Pohang, Yeongcheon, and Daegu. The People's Army on the eastern and western fronts did not give the enemy any time to breathe, rushing towards Daegu and Busan, pressing along the Nakdong River. The enemy suffered repeated defeats and was panicked. Although several US divisions and a British brigade were successively transferred, they could not stop our army's brave and unparalleled offensive. On September 1, the Nakdong River defense line was also broken through by our army. As the enemy increased a large number of troops, their front line was greatly shortened, and they had railways and highways between Daegu and Busan, and they used favorable terrain to stubbornly resist, so the battle entered a stalemate.

    During more than two months of fierce fighting, our heroic People's Army wiped out more than 100,000 American and Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) puppet troops, liberated 90% of the land in the southern half of Korea and 92% of the population in the southern half of Korea, and shattered the American imperialists' aggressive plan to annex our country. However, in order to save its prestige, which had plummeted due to its disastrous defeat, the American aggressors continued their aggression, concentrated all the forces they could use in the Far East, and coerced their vassal states with threats and intimidation. On September 15, they launched a frantic large-scale landing at Incheon Port, seriously threatening the rear of the People's Army. The People's Army in the Incheon and Seoul areas launched fierce blocking battles against the enemy, who had an absolute advantage in numbers and equipment. After killing and wounding more than 14,000 enemies and inflicting heavy blows on them, they actively withdrew from Seoul. Under such unfavorable conditions, our defensive forces also showed the imperialist aggressors the heroic spirit and powerful power of the People's Army.

    After the American aggressors occupied Seoul, disregarding the strong opposition of democratic countries all over the world and the serious warnings of the People's Republic of China, they frantically invaded the northern half of our republic. In order to concentrate our forces and prepare for a new counter-offensive, our army made a temporary strategic retreat. The front line moved rapidly north, and the changing situation created many difficulties for our People's Army, and our army faced a severe test; but our army still struck the invading enemy everywhere with high enemy spirit and firm fighting spirit. The troops of our army behind the enemy continued to strike the enemy on the one hand and made a planned retreat on the other hand in order to preserve their strength and organize a new strong counter-attack to annihilate the enemy and defend the motherland and the people. Through the arduous period of retreat, our People's Army has become an army that is good at both offensive and retreat operations. This greatly frightened the enemy.

    The American aggressors not only dispatched the Seventh Fleet to occupy Taiwan of the People's Republic of China long ago, but also, after invading the northern half of our country, they aggressively burned the flames of war to the border of the Chinese mainland, and sent warplanes to invade Chinese airspace and carry out barbaric bombings, directly threatening the security of the People's Republic of China. Under such circumstances, the great Chinese people, in order to "resist US aggression and aid Korea, protect our homes and defend our country," formed a volunteer army and came to the Korean battlefield.

    Under the unified command of General Kim Il-sung, the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers closely joined forces and turned to counterattack, severely hitting the American aggressors who clamored to "completely occupy Korea before Christmas." In the five battles that the Korean and Chinese People's Armies successively fought, the enemy suffered fatal blows, liberated the vast areas and vast populations once occupied by the enemy, fundamentally reversed the critical Korean war situation, and laid the foundation for our army's final victory. After that, our army made appropriate shifts for rest and reorganization. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the enemy boasted of the so-called "magnetic tactics" and began to "pursue." Afterwards, Van Fleet launched the so-called "summer limited offensive" and "autumn offensive" against our army's defense line one after another, but they were all declared bankrupt after being annihilated by our army's devastating counterattack.

    The victory of our heroic resistance completely shattered the American imperialists' delusion of a "quick victory," thoroughly exposed the truth of the enemy's much-publicized "technical superiority," and deepened the internal difficulties, contradictions, and divisions within the American aggressor group, forcing them to accept Malik's proposal to hold armistice talks.

    The reason why we were able to achieve such brilliant victories is because all the officers and soldiers of our People's Army displayed unparalleled heroism. We have demonstrated unyielding perseverance in the face of any difficulties. In the arduous offensive battles and fierce defensive battles, the officers and soldiers of our People's Army disregarded the enemy's frantic bombing and the firepower of the enemy's tanks and artillery, overcame various difficulties, annihilated the enemy, and were loyal to the motherland and the leader. In particular, under the conditions of disparity in technical equipment and armed forces between the enemy and us, we still achieved victory with an indomitable fighting will. Wounded soldiers, with a noble spirit of self-sacrifice and a sense of responsibility to defend the motherland, resolutely stayed on the front line and continued to fight. The heroic martyrs, when they were dying, shouted "Long live the Workers' Party!" "Long live General Kim Il-sung!" and encouraged their comrades to "advance bravely and eliminate the enemy!" Our officers and soldiers bravely waded across the freezing river water under the enemy's artillery blockade. In the icy and snowy weather of minus 20 degrees Celsius or more, in order not to give the fleeing enemy time to breathe, they continued to pursue and annihilate the enemy even without food.

    The American imperialist aggressor army has superior technical equipment and a large number of aircraft, tanks, and artillery, but our People's Army has overcome the enemy's technical superiority, actively responded to the leader's call, equipped itself with modern weapons, and established an iron-like regular army that is good at using these weapons. We learn as we fight, and our technical equipment is constantly increasing. Although our People's Army is young, it has accumulated rich combat experience in fierce battles and has grown into an invincible force. The officers and soldiers of our People's Army have skillful command art, combat skills, and rich combat experience in offensive warfare, defensive warfare, mobile warfare, and guerrilla warfare. The commanders of the People's Army have become officers who can command, unite, and educate troops in complex environments. The soldiers of the People's Army strictly abide by discipline, cherish weapons, and unite with infinite loyalty and tenacity in the execution of combat missions.

    II. What Are the Reasons for the Victory of the Korean People's Army?

    What is the source of the invincible power of the young People's Army, which has only been established for four years, in achieving brilliant victories in the struggle against the arch-criminal of world imperialism, the self-proclaimed most powerful American imperialism, and causing the American imperialists to suffer an irreparable disastrous defeat?

    First, it lies in the fact that the Fatherland Liberation War we are waging is a just war against aggression, defending the freedom, independence, and honor of the motherland, and further defending lasting peace for mankind. Every one of our combatants and commanders personally experienced the misfortune of not having a motherland and the suffering of being a slave under the cruel rule of Japanese imperialism for the past half century, and is unwilling to allow the motherland they have built, as well as their beloved territory and happy life, to be trampled on by the enemy again. It is with this noble quality and enemy spirit that our People's Army overcomes the enemy. The combat effectiveness of an army is composed of various conditions. The most important of these is the morale of the army; and morale is determined by the social system, national policy, and war objectives. Marshal Stalin pointed out long ago: "The strength of the Red Army lies first of all in the fact that it is not waging an aggressive war, not an imperialist war, but a war of defense of the fatherland, of liberation, of justice." He also pointed out: "The German soldier does not have a noble and glorious war purpose that can inspire him and make him proud. On the contrary, any Red Army soldier can proudly declare that he is waging a just and liberating war, a war to defend the freedom and independence of the motherland. The Red Army has a noble and glorious war purpose sufficient to inspire it to establish merits. It is precisely for this reason that the Great Patriotic War has produced thousands upon thousands of men and women heroes in our country who are determined to fight to the death for the freedom of the motherland." (See Stalin's order on the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army on February 23, 1942) Precisely because of this, a large number of heroes have emerged in our People's Army in the course of the Fatherland Liberation War. The deeds of patriotism and heroism they created will be immortalized in history.

    Second, the source of the People's Army's invincible power lies in the superiority of the People's Army itself. Although the People's Army has a short history of establishment, it inherited the glorious tradition of General Kim Il-sung's anti-Japanese guerrilla forces, who fought for the freedom and independence of the motherland for more than ten years, and took patriotic people who had experienced a long period of anti-Japanese armed struggle as the backbone, so it has the fighting spirit to overcome various difficulties and carry out heroic struggles. At the same time, our People's Army is composed of the sons and daughters of the working people who have a high degree of political consciousness and patriotic enthusiasm. It has a broad mass base and has a blood relationship with the interests of the country and the people. Therefore, the Korean People's Army receives the absolute support of the Korean people. The officers and soldiers of the People's Army have the noble political qualities of going through fire and water and dedicating their lives for the freedom of the motherland and the happiness of the people.

    At the same time, our People's Army educated and trained itself with the most advanced Soviet military science created by the great Lenin and Stalin, strengthened itself with modern combat technology, and absorbed the valuable experience exchanged with blood by the heroic Soviet army; therefore, it has grown into an iron-like regular army armed with modern military technology. From the first day of its birth, our People's Army has been armed with the ideas of Lenin and Stalin, with true internationalism and a high degree of patriotism that loves the motherland and the people, and is growing in the iron-like discipline based on political consciousness. Therefore, the soldiers of the People's Army thoroughly realize that it is their glorious task today to stop the invasion of the American beasts, liberate our motherland, and liberate the people from the atrocities of the beasts. This is also one of the sources of our invincible power.

    Third, the People's Army's invincible power is due to the correct leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, the vanguard of the Korean working people, and General Kim Il-sung, the organizer, leader, and wise leader of our Korean People's Army. The Party and the leader not only established our People's Army in a timely manner, but also equipped and trained us with modern weapons, correctly organized and led the political education work of the People's Army, and deeply cared for it, and cultivated the People's Army into a determined army with a spirit of dedication to fight for the motherland and the people. In addition, the Party organization in the army promoted all commanders, gave play to organized capabilities, played an organizational and mobilization role among all combatants, and became a guarantee for strengthening the combat effectiveness of the troops and successfully executing combat missions. There are countless examples of this. At the same time, the wise leadership of the Party and the leader also played a decisive role in consolidating the rear and supporting the front. The Party not only united all patriotic political parties and social organizations in the country during peacetime and strengthened the united front; but also, in the sacred Fatherland Liberation War against the imperialist aggressors and defending the freedom, independence, and honor of the motherland, launched work to strengthen the unified democratic front of the motherland. "Our Party has united all the people more closely around our Party and the government of the Republic, overcoming all difficulties, and effectively carried out the great work of ensuring the final victory of the Fatherland Liberation War." (Kim Il-sung) Therefore, our People's Army has a solid rear, timely supply of military supplies and food, and can continue to fight with a more firm belief in victory.

    Finally, the source of the invincible power of our People's Army lies in the strong support and assistance of the fraternal people of various democratic countries, headed by the Soviet people. The great Soviet people, the liberators of our Korean people, provided material, spiritual, and technical assistance to the establishment of our People's Army, and made great contributions to the development of the People's Army. In the course of the war, they also gave us concern and encouragement for our victory. Under the sacred banner of "Resisting US Aggression and Aiding Korea, Protecting Our Homes and Defending Our Country," the fraternal Chinese people sent volunteers. They not only directly supported us with military force, but also sent a large number of valuable materials to relieve the disaster victims and orphans in our war zone; at the same time, they encouraged us in various forms and methods. In Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Mongolia, and in every corner of the world, all people who love peace and democracy are supporting and supporting us. They shouted in unison: "We will be the backing of the Korean people!" "Long live the heroic Korean people!" The support and assistance of peace-loving people all over the world strengthened our belief in victory and made us more determined to strive for final victory to repay them.

    The above points are the source of the invincible power of our People's Army. This is a point where we are stronger than the enemy. This advantage of ours is a factor that determines the fate of the war and will always play a role. Today, although the enemy on the Korean battlefield still has an advantage in modern technical equipment, this advantage is by no means long-term and must change; on the contrary, the enemy will never have the advantages we have. From the first day of its establishment, the Korean People's Army has been growing stronger as a truly people's armed force. Especially through the fierce Fatherland Liberation War, overcoming and enduring all difficulties and severe tests, it has achieved a decisive victory.

    III. The Korean People's Army Must Strive for Final Victory

    The task of striving for final victory is still before us. Although the enemy's internal crisis has intensified due to its failure in Korea, and it has been forced to hold armistice talks with us due to the pressure of the peace movement of people all over the world, including the American people; however, their aggressive nature and aggressive ambitions have not changed. The ongoing armistice talks, which are still in progress due to the other side's intentional provocations and insistence on shameless demands, have not reached an agreement after seven months. At the same time, the military actions they have taken during the negotiations and the fact that they are frantically supporting the Japanese and West German fascist bandits are enough to prove their aggressive ambitions.

    In order to defeat the enemy and strive for final victory, we must understand the many difficulties before us and must be prepared to wage a long-term and arduous struggle. Here, we need to first recognize the long-term and arduous nature of the war. It is necessary to recognize that tendencies such as being satisfied with the victories and small experiences already achieved or underestimating the enemy are incorrect. It is necessary to make ideological preparations for combat, so as to smash the enemy's new conspiracies and aggressive actions in any environment, and to further strengthen our People's Army on the basis of the victories and achievements already achieved, and to train it into a modern army armed with excellent technical equipment. It is necessary to summarize and strive to learn the experiences exchanged with blood, and to improve the learning enthusiasm of the entire People's Army, so as to absorb the advanced Soviet military science and the experiences gained by the Chinese people through long-term and arduous struggles. Learning while fighting, and fighting while learning, resolutely implement the leader's teaching: "We must make our army learn modern technology and make it a modern regular army that is good at using technology."

    Of course, we love peace. But we are not afraid of war. In order to strive for peace, we must not be afraid of difficulties. To overcome difficulties, to make full preparations to stop the enemy's aggression, to meet the struggle with revolutionary heroism and optimism, in order to strive for the final victory.

    朝鲜人民军已成为必胜不败的强大力量
    ——为纪念朝鲜人民军建军四周年而作
    朝鲜人民军前线司令官  金雄
    我们朝鲜人民军在为反抗妄图变朝鲜为其殖民地的美国侵略者和它的走狗而进行伟大的祖国解放战争的环境中，迎接建军四周年的节日。在近半个世纪的漫长期间饱尝了殖民地惨痛生活的朝鲜人民，在被伟大的苏军解放后，深切地认识到为了保卫自己业已取得的政权和各种民主改革的成果、争取祖国的独立统一以及保卫自己以创造性的劳动而取得的光辉成绩，必须建立真正属于人民的武装力量。野兽般的美帝国主义强盗占领我国的南半部，并制造各种阴谋，妄图并吞我国全部疆土，使得我们朝鲜人民的建军要求更为迫切。因此，朝鲜人民就在一九四八年二月八日建立了朝鲜人民军——捍卫祖国的坚强堡垒以及保卫人民利益和世界持久和平的正义的人民武装力量。
    一、我们人民军积累着丰富的战斗经验
    执行着崇高的使命和任务的人民军将士们，受着全体人民的无限欢迎和尊敬，遵循着朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军的指示，积极学习马列主义理论和现代军事科学和技术。朝鲜人民军继承了金日成将军抗日游击斗争的革命传统，吸收了先进的苏联军队的宝贵经验。我们人民军虽然年青，但是，它从诞生的头一天起，就开始在现代正规化军队的基础上成长壮大着。一九五零年六月二十五日，世界侵略阵营的元凶美帝国主义唆使李承晚卖国匪帮，对我共和国北半部发动武装侵犯。我们人民军毫不畏惧地、沉着地挫败了敌人的进攻，随即转入反攻，歼灭敌人的主力。在战争开始后三天，六月二十八日，就解放了首都汉城。其后，人民军以破竹之势，向南挺进。到七月初，已解放了水原、平泽、利川、安城、原州、堤川、平昌、三陟等战略上的重要城市。
    美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮在开始向朝鲜北部进攻时，就梦想一举占领平壤和元山。但是，事实上正如美国参谋长联席会议主席布莱德雷所供认的一样：“没有人想到北朝鲜会像后来事实证明的那样强大。我们根据我们的情报，过低估计了他们”。
    遭到惨败的侵略元凶——杜鲁门为了挽回失败的局面，竟在六月三十日命令它的陆军直接参加朝鲜战争，命令它的海军加紧封锁朝鲜海岸，并命令它大批的空军轰炸平壤、元山等地。七月一日，美军第二十四师出现在乌山战场上了。但是，这并没有吓倒朝鲜人民军，而只是向全世界人民暴露了美帝国主义狰狞的侵略面目。
    我们英雄的人民军继续挺进，在西线一举突破敌人吹嘘为“铜墙铁壁”的锦江防线。到七月二十日，解放了鸟致院、清州、公州、大田；同时，歼灭了美军第二十四师的大部，活捉了该师师长迪安。在七月三十日前后，我军正面部队解放了永同、金泉、星州等要地。我军迂回部队解放了光州、木浦、丽水、晋州、固城、咸安，威胁了敌人的退路。此外，东线我军也在同一的步伐下，利用山岳地带的有利地形，歼灭垂死抵抗的李伪军残部。在七月三十日前后，解放了闻庆、咸昌、尚州、醴泉、安东、蔚山、盈德等重要地区，从正面向浦项、永川、大邱等地挺进。东西战线的人民军不给敌人以喘息的时间，奔向大邱、釜山方面，进薄洛东江沿岸。敌人节节失败，惊慌失措。虽然先后调来美军几个师和英军一个旅的兵力，但也阻挡不住我军勇猛无比的进攻。九月一日，洛东江防线也被我军突破。由于敌人增加了大批的兵力，其战线已大大缩短，又拥有大邱和釜山间的铁道、公路，并利用有利的地形来进行顽抗，因此，战斗进入了相持状态。
    在两个多月激烈的战斗过程中，我们英雄的人民军消灭了美军和李承晚伪军十多万人，解放了朝鲜南半部百分之九十的土地和朝鲜南半部百分之九十二的人口，粉碎了美帝国主义妄图吞并我国的侵略计划。但是，美国侵略者为了挽回它因遭受惨败而
    一落千丈的威信，继续进行侵略，乃集中了它在远东所能使用的全部兵力，并以威胁恫吓的手段纠集其仆从国家的兵力，在九月十五日疯狂地在仁川港大举登陆，严重威胁了人民军的后方。仁川和汉城地区的人民军和在数量装备上占绝对优势的敌人展开了激烈的阻击战。在毙伤敌一万四千多名、给敌人以重大的打击之后，主动撤出汉城。我军防御部队在如此不利的条件下也向帝国主义侵略者显示了人民军的英雄气概和强大威力。
    美国侵略者占领汉城后，不顾全世界各民主国家的强烈反对和中华人民共和国的严重警告，竟向我共和国北半部疯狂进犯。我军为了集中力量，准备新的反攻，作了暂时的战略退却。战线迅速向北推移，形势的变化给我们人民军造成了许多困难，我军面临着严重的考验；但我军仍然以高度的敌忾和坚强的斗志，到处打击着进犯的敌人。我军在敌后的部队一面继续打击敌人，一面作了有计划的退却，以便保存实力，组织新的强有力的反击战来歼灭敌人、保卫祖国与人民。我们人民军通过艰苦的退却时期，已成为既善于进攻又善于退却作战的军队。这使敌人大为胆寒。
    美国侵略者不但早就派遣第七舰队占领了中华人民共和国的台湾，而且在它侵入我国北半部后，又气势汹汹地把战火烧到了中国大陆的边境，并派出作战飞机侵入中国领空，施行野蛮的轰炸，直接威胁中华人民共和国的安全。在这种情况下，伟大的中国人民为了“抗美援朝保家卫国”，组成志愿军，开到朝鲜战场来了。
    朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军在人民军最高司令
    官金日成将军的统一指挥下，紧密地并肩转入反攻，沉重打击了叫嚣“要在圣诞节前完全占领朝鲜”的美国侵略者。朝中人民军队在先后进行的五次战役中，使敌人遭到了致命的打击，解放了被敌人一度侵占的广大地区和广大人民，根本扭转了危急的朝鲜战局，奠定了我军最后胜利的基础。此后，我军为了休整，又作了适当的转移。敌人利用这一机会，吹嘘着所谓“磁性战术”，开始“追击”。其后，范佛里特对我军防线又先后发动了所谓“夏季有限攻势”和“秋季攻势”，但都遭到我军歼灭性的反击而宣告破产。
    我们英勇抗战的胜利，根本粉碎了美帝国主义
    “速战速决”的妄想，彻底揭露了敌人大肆鼓吹的
    “技术优势”的真相，并使美国侵略集团内部的困难矛盾与分裂日益加深，使他们不得不接受马立克关于举行停战谈判的建议。
    我们所以能够取得如此辉煌的胜利，是因为我们人民军的全体官兵发挥了无比的英勇精神。我们在任何困难的面前，都发挥了坚忍不拔的刚毅性。我们人民军官兵在艰苦的进攻战和激烈的防御战中，不顾敌机的疯狂炸射和敌军坦克、大炮的火力，克服各种困难，歼灭敌人，效忠于祖国和领袖。特别是在敌我的技术装备和武装力量相差悬殊的条件下，仍以不屈不挠的斗争意志取得了胜利。负伤的战士以崇高的自我牺牲精神和保卫祖国的责任心，坚决不下火线，继续战斗。壮烈牺牲的烈士们在临死的时候，还高呼“劳动党万岁！”“金日成将军万岁！”并鼓励战友们“要勇敢前进消灭敌人！”我们的官兵在敌人炮火的封锁下，勇猛地涉过寒气刺骨的江水。在零下二十度以上的冰天雪地里，为了不让逃敌有喘息的时间，吃不上饭，也要继续追歼敌人。
    美帝国主义的侵略军队具有优势的技术装备和大量的飞机、坦克和大炮，但是，我们人民军却战胜了敌人的技术优势，积极响应了领袖的号召，以现代化武器装备起来，建立善于使用这些武器的钢铁般的正规军队。我们边学边打，我们的技术装备日益增强了。我们人民军虽然年青，但它已在激烈的战斗中积累了丰富的战斗经验，壮大成必胜不败的力量了。我们人民军的全体官兵在进攻战、防御战、运动战和游击战中，都具有熟练的指挥艺术、战斗技术和丰富的战斗经验。人民军的指挥官们已成为在复杂的环境里能够指挥、团结和教育部队的军官。人民军的战士们严守纪律，爱护武器，在执行战斗任务中，以无限的忠诚和顽强团结起来了。
    二、朝鲜人民军取得胜利的原因何在？
    建军仅有四年的年青的人民军在与世界帝国主义的元凶、自称最强大的美帝国主义的斗争中取得了辉煌的胜利，使美帝国主义者遭到不可收拾的惨败的必胜力量的泉源在那里呢？
    第一，在于我们所进行着的祖国解放战争是反对侵略、保卫祖国的自由独立荣誉、进而保卫人类的持久和平的正义战争。我们的每一个战斗员和指挥官，在过去半世纪日本帝国主义的残酷统治下，亲身体验了没有祖国的不幸和作为奴隶的痛苦，不愿意让自己建立起来的祖国以及自己可爱的疆土和幸福生活再受敌人蹂躏。我们人民军就以这种崇高的品质和敌忾战胜着敌人。军队的战斗力是由各种条件构成的。其中最重要的是军队的作战士气；而士气决定于社会制度、国家政策和战争目的。斯大林大元帅早已指出：“红军的力量首先就在于它所进行的不是侵略战争，不是帝国主义战争，而是保卫祖国的、解放的、正义的战争。”他并指出：“德国兵士没有足以鼓舞他、使他引为自豪的高尚光荣的战争目的。反之，任何一个红军战士都能自豪地声言说，他是进行着正义的、解放的战争，进行着捍卫祖国自由独立的战争。红军是有足以鼓舞其建立勋功的高尚光荣的战争目的。也正是由于这个原因，所以卫国战争就在我国产生了成千成万为祖国自由而誓死奋斗的男女英雄。”（见一九四二年二月二十三日红军成立二十四周年斯大林命令）正因为这样，在祖国解放战争的过程中，我们人民军中涌现出了大批英雄。他们创造的爱国主义与英雄主义的事迹，将永垂史册。
    第二，人民军必胜力量的源泉在于人民军本身的优越性。我们人民军的建军历史虽然很短，但是，它继承了十多年来为祖国的自由独立而斗争的金日成将军的抗日游击队的光荣传统，并以经历过长期抗日武装斗争的爱国志士为骨干，所以它具有克服各种困难而进行英勇斗争的战斗精神。同时，我们人民军是由具有高度政治觉悟和爱国热忱的劳动人民的儿女组成的。它有着广大的群众基础，和国家与人民的利益有着血缘关系。因此，朝鲜人民军受到朝鲜人民的绝对支援。人民军的官兵们具有为祖国的自由与人民的幸福而赴汤蹈火和献出自己生命的高贵政治品质。
    同时我们人民军以伟大的列宁、斯大林所创建的最先进的苏联军事科学来教育和训练了自己，用现代化的战斗技术来加强自己，吸收了英雄的苏军用血换来的宝贵经验；因此，它已壮大成为一支以现代军事技术武装起来的钢铁般的正规军队。我们人民军从它诞生的头一天起，就以列宁、斯大林的思想、以真正的国际主义和爱护祖国与人民的高度的爱国主义思想武装起来，在基于政治觉悟的钢铁般的纪律中成长着。所以，人民军将士彻底地认识到：今天制止美国野兽们的侵犯、解放我们祖国、从野兽们的暴行中解放人民一事，是自己的光荣任务。这又是我们必胜不败的力量的泉源之一。
    第三，朝鲜人民军必胜的力量是由于朝鲜劳动人民的先锋队——朝鲜劳动党和我们朝鲜人民军的组织者、领导者、英明的领袖金日成将军的正确领导。党和领袖不仅及时建立了我们人民军，而且以现代的武装来装备和训练了我们，正确地组织和领导了人民军的政治教育工作，并深切的加以关怀，把人民军培养成为一支为祖国与人民而斗争的有献身精神的刚毅军队。此外，军队中的党的组织并推动全体指挥官，发挥了有组织的能力，在全体战斗员中起了组织动员的作用，成为加强部队战斗力和胜利执行战斗任务的保障。这种例子是不胜枚举的。同时，党和领袖的英明领导，在巩固后方、支援前线的斗争中，也起了决定性的作用。党不仅在和平时期团结了国内全体爱国的政党社会团体，加强了统一战线；而且在反抗帝国主义侵略者、保卫祖国的自由独立荣誉的神圣祖国解放战争中，也展开了加强祖国统一民主主义战线的工作。“我党使全体人民更紧密地团结在我党和共和国政府的周围，克服着一切困难，有效地进行了保证祖国解放战争最后胜利的巨大工作。”（金日成）因此，我们人民军有了巩固的后方，得到了军需品和食粮的及时供应，并能以更加坚定的胜利信心，继续进行着斗争。
    最后，我们人民军必胜不败力量的源泉在于以苏联人民为首的兄弟般的各民主国家人民的强有力的支持和援助。我们朝鲜人民的解放恩人——伟大的苏联人民对我们人民军的创建，曾予以物质上、精神上和技术上的援助，对人民军的发展作了很大的贡献。在战争过程中，也为了我们的胜利，寄予我们关心和鼓励。兄弟般的中国人民在“抗美援朝保家卫国”的神圣旗帜下，派来了志愿军。他们不但直接用武力支援了我们，而且为救济我国的战区灾民和孤儿，又送来了大批宝贵的物资；同时，还用各种形式和方法鼓舞着我们。在捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、波兰、保加利亚、蒙古，在全世界的每一个角落里，爱好和平与民主的全体人民都在支持和声援我们。他们一致高呼：“我们要作朝鲜人民的后盾！”“英雄的朝鲜人民万岁！”全世界爱好和平人民的声援和援助，加强着我们的胜利信心，并使我们更加坚定了争取最后胜利以答谢他们的决心。
    上述几点，就是我们人民军必胜不败的力量的泉源。这是我们强于敌人的一点。我们的这种优势，是决定战争命运，并永远起着作用的因素。今天，朝鲜战场上的敌人在现代化的技术装备上虽然还居于优势，但这种优势绝不是长期性的，一定要起变化的；相反地，敌人却永远不会有我们所具有的优势。朝鲜人民军从其创建的头一天起，就作为真正的人民的武装力量而壮大着。尤其是通过激烈的祖国解放战争，战胜和经受了一切困难和严重的考验，它已取得了决定意义的胜利。
    三、朝鲜人民军一定要争取最后胜利
    我们的面前还摆着争取最后胜利的任务。敌人虽然因其在朝鲜的失败，内部危机加重，招致了全世界人民包括美国人民在内的和平运动的压力，被迫和我方举行停战谈判；但是，他们的侵略本质和侵略野心并没有改变。由于对方有意的挑衅和坚持无耻的要求，目前仍在进行的停战谈判，已进行了七个月还没有达成协议。同时，他们在谈判期间所采取的军事行动和疯狂地扶植日本和西德法西斯强盗的事实，就足以证明他们的侵略野心。
    为了打败敌人，争取最后胜利，我们必须了解我们面前的许多困难，必须准备进行长期的艰苦斗争。在这里，就需要我们首先认清战争的长期性和艰苦性。要认清：满足于业已取得的胜利和微小的经验或轻视敌人等倾向是不正确的。要作好战斗的思想准备，以便在任何环境中粉碎敌人的新阴谋与侵略行动，更要以业已取得的胜利和成果作基础，使我们人民军进一步强大，使它锻炼成以优秀的技术装备武装起来的现代化军队。要总结和努力学习用血换来的经验，要提高全体人民军的学习热潮，以吸收先进苏联的军事科学和中国人民经过长期的艰苦斗争所得来的经验。边学边打，边打边学，坚决地执行领袖的教导：“要使我们的军队学会现代技术，使它成为善于运用技术的现代的正规军队。”
    当然，我们是爱好和平的。但是，我们是不怕战争的。我们为了争取和平，就不要畏惧困难。要战胜困难，要作制止敌人侵略的充分准备，要以革命的英雄主义和乐观主义来迎接斗争，以争取最后的胜利。  （新华社）
