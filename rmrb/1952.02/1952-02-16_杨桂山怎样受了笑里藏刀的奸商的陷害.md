How Yang Guishan was Framed by the Scheming Merchant

		Pan Di, Mou Chengqi

The purchasing personnel of several factories under the Light Industry Bureau of the Northeast People's Government's Industrial Department were dragged into a mire of filth by the cunning merchant Zhang Dewen using vicious methods. Yang Guishan, the materials clerk of the Fourth Paper Mill, was one of them.

Yang Guishan was originally a materials clerk at the Eighth Paper Mill in Andong. In April 1950, he was sent to Shenyang to purchase materials. When he arrived in Shenyang, the head of the business section gave him a task: to urge the merchant Zhang Dewen to quickly transport the ten tons of copper he had contracted to sell to Andong. This is how Yang Guishan came to know Zhang Dewen, a cunning merchant who specialized in speculative buying and selling and profiteering. Zhang Dewen was originally a broker with no capital, relying solely on introducing business to earn commissions. Because he was good at flattering, bribing, and currying favor with cadres, he had obtained considerable ill-gotten gains. The ten tons of copper he contracted to sell to the Eighth Paper Mill was such a fictitious transaction. He himself did not have ten tons of copper, but he saw the large profit in this deal, so he eagerly agreed to the sale and stipulated that the goods be delivered in Andong. His intention was to bribe the cadres to pay in advance after the transaction was completed, and then buy the copper on a temporary basis. Yang Guishan, who had just arrived in Shenyang, did not understand this trick, and thus fell into the trap of the cunning merchant.

When Yang Guishan went to urge the delivery, the cunning merchant Zhang Dewen greeted him with a smiling face, bowing and scraping, and said: the ten tons of copper has already been shipped to Andong, hoping to pay the money as soon as possible. Then he invited Yang Guishan to a restaurant. After eating and drinking, he forced Yang Guishan to ask for the money, and made a long-distance call to the Andong Paper Mill No. 8. At the same time, he patted Yang Guishan on the shoulder and said: "This deal makes a lot of money, enough for us brothers to spend." Three days later, the money was indeed remitted. Yang Guishan, unaware of the details, paid Zhang Dewen the full amount for the ten tons of copper. The cunning merchant then stuffed him with more than 12 million yuan (Northeast currency). A few days later, a letter came from the Eighth Mill saying: only three tons of copper were shipped. But at this time, Yang Guishan had already accepted the bribe, and his mouth was sealed. From then on, the cunning merchant began to target this target, and further attacked with sugar-coated bullets.

After Yang Guishan accepted the bribe for the first time, the cunning merchant Zhang Dewen tried every means to get Yang Guishan to live in his house in order to monopolize the business of the Eighth Mill. At first, he took Yang Guishan to his house to play and entertained him diligently. Later, he often took Yang Guishan there, and every time he bought wine and meat to entertain him. And he seemed to be caring to the point of being meticulous, saying: "Brother, what do you want to eat? Eat fish? Eat meat?..." If Yang Guishan didn't go for three days, he would call with fake intentions and say: "Brother? You really made your brother miss you! Why didn't you come? Don't mess around outside!" Soon, Zhang Dewen learned that Yang Guishan's wife was in Andong, so he said to Yang Guishan with sweet words: "Why not bring your sister-in-law to Shenyang to see the world? Eating and living are all on your brother." He also often said sweetly to Yang Guishan: "Today we brothers make friends, just like brothers in life and death. Brother will not only treat you like this today, but even if you have a day when you don't want to work, whatever brother eats and wears, I will let you eat and wear the same." Yang Guishan was actually deceived by these diligent false words of the cunning merchant Zhang Dewen, and felt that Zhang Dewen was stronger to him than his own brother. Therefore, he listened to everything Zhang Dewen said.

The cunning merchant Zhang Dewen not only gained Yang Guishan's trust in terms of feelings, but he also wanted to corrupt Yang Guishan ideologically and in life, so that Yang Guishan could completely collude with him. When Yang Guishan went to his house, he deliberately displayed milk, eggs, and white flour, showed off his woolen clothes and leather overcoat, and said temptingly: "Brother eats so well, wears so well, can you do it without money? I think your revolution is in vain, without money, everything is in vain." He also deliberately satirized Yang Guishan by giving him the nickname "broken cotton jacket," and said: "No matter how revolutionary you are, you are still a broken cotton jacket. Brother doesn't make revolution, and can't stop eating japonica rice and white flour." At the same time, he shamelessly boasted: "Brother has changed more than a dozen wives, as long as you have money, brother, you can have whatever you want." He also often took Yang Guishan to restaurants and brothels. In this way, Yang Guishan gradually became interested in the decadent and degenerate life of the bourgeoisie.

Seeing that Yang Guishan had fallen into the trap and was completely under his control, the cunning merchant Zhang Dewen came straight to the point and said his intention: "It's really a good job to be a buyer, it's really a fool if you don't make a fortune. Once you miss this village, there will be no such shop!" And he also encouraged Yang Guishan to abandon revolutionary work and said: "After we have made a big fortune, we brothers will take our wives to Tianjin to do business."

In October 1950, the Resist America, Aid Korea movement began. Zhang Dewen thought the opportunity had come, so he spread rumors to Yang Guishan, saying: "Brother, I think the Communist Party is about to end this time, let's take this good opportunity to make a fortune!" Then he encouraged Yang Guishan to collude with Zhang Chengshan, the warehouse keeper of the Light Industry Bureau, to steal unregistered materials. And he threatened Yang Guishan, saying: "What are you afraid of, you have eaten money before, might as well go all the way, brother is not for your own good." Under the instigation of the cunning merchant, Yang Guishan really colluded with Zhang Chengshan, and through Zhang Dewen, he stole materials three times in total, obtaining more than 27 million yuan (Northeast currency). Zhang Dewen stole most of it.

In April 1951, Yang Guishan was transferred to work in the Jinzhou Fourth Factory, and was still responsible for purchasing in Shenyang. Seeing that there was still profit to be made from Yang Guishan, Zhang Dewen was still unusually diligent to Yang Guishan. At this time, Yang Guishan had brought his wife to Shenyang to live in Zhang Dewen's home. In front of Yang Guishan's wife, Zhang Dewen treated her like an "old lady", calling her sister-in-law respectfully.

However, cunning merchants are like flies, they flock to wherever there are sweet and dirty things; once these things are gone, they turn against you and leave.

After Yang Guishan returned to Jinzhou for something, he didn't return to Shenyang for a month. Zhang Dewen learned that Yang Guishan had been assigned to work in Harbin, so he used a fake name to run to Harbin to find Yang Guishan, wanting to find an opportunity to do speculative business. As a result, it was completely different from what he thought. Yang Guishan was not purchasing with cash there, but was allocated by the public. Zhang Dewen immediately felt that Yang Guishan was useless, and he could not get any "oil" from him, so he showed his true colors, exposed the even more ugly face of the bourgeoisie, played rogue, and asked Yang Guishan for travel expenses, otherwise he would reveal Yang Guishan's past theft of materials. Yang Guishan was forced to do nothing, although he had no money himself (the dirty money Yang Guishan got in the past was deposited in Zhang Dewen's house because he trusted Zhang Dewen), he had to give Zhang Dewen 1.1 million yuan (Northeast currency) of public funds.

A month later, Yang Guishan returned to Shenyang from Harbin. As soon as he entered Zhang Dewen's house, his wife hugged him and cried loudly, sadly telling him the following experience:

Since Zhang Dewen returned from Harbin, he had completely changed his attitude towards Yang Guishan's wife. He and his wife cursed Yang Guishan in front of Yang Guishan's wife all day long, saying: "Yang Guishan, I curse his ancestors, putting his wife in my house and asking me to support her, where in the world is there such a good thing!" From then on, not only did he ask Yang Guishan's wife to do the work of lighting the stove, cooking, washing clothes, and pouring the chamber pot; sometimes Zhang Dewen and his wife deliberately did not go home to eat, and there was no rice prepared at home, so Yang Guishan's wife had to go hungry. Even so, the cunning merchant still felt that it was "not enough", and saw that Yang Guishan's wife was a country woman and easy to bully, so he wanted to "make a fortune" from her. So Zhang Dewen deceived Yang Guishan's wife and said: "Sister-in-law, Yang Guishan has lost his conscience. He made a fortune in Harbin and got another woman. He said he wants to divorce you, I don't think you should count on him." He also asked his wife to persuade Yang Guishan's wife and said: "Sister-in-law, you should be flexible, how can you not live? I think it's not bad for you to find a way out by yourself! It's not bad to do what Xiao Er (Xiao Er is a prostitute who often goes to Zhang Dewen's house) does." In this way, they insidiously wanted to push Yang Guishan's wife into the water and become a prostitute. Yang Guishan's wife refused to agree to anything, just cried and hoped that Yang Guishan would be able to return one day. In order to achieve his base and shameless criminal purpose, Zhang Dewen adopted even more vicious and insidious methods: one night, Zhang Dewen and his wife pretended to go to the movies, leaving Yang Guishan's wife alone at home. After they left, they secretly called his rogue brother-in-law to sneak into the house, wanting to rape Yang Guishan's wife. Because she struggled hard and shouted loudly, she scared the rogue away and was not defiled. Yang Guishan's wife fell ill and was unable to get out of bed for several days; even so, Zhang Dewen still drove her away every day.

After Yang Guishan heard his wife tell these things while crying, his face turned green with anger, and he wanted to immediately go to the police station to accuse Zhang Dewen and his brother-in-law. However, the cunning merchant glared at him and said: "Hum! You dare to accuse others! You are a government worker, are you not afraid of breaking the law for corruption and bribery?" Yang Guishan was immediately threatened, and he didn't say a word for a long time, so he had to tell his wife to pack her things and move to a hotel. When they were about to leave, the cunning merchant used the name of "meal money" to not only extort and blackmail Yang Guishan for more than one million yuan and a gold pendant, but also barbarously and violently tore off Yang Guishan's raincoat.

The movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has been vigorously launched. Yang Guishan finally woke up, boldly confessed his past mistakes to the higher authorities, and ruthlessly exposed the crimes of the cunning merchant Zhang Dewen who framed him. He said with grief and indignation: "In the past, I did not stand firmly on the position of the working class and was framed by the cunning merchant Zhang Dewen, becoming a prisoner of the bourgeoisie; today, the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have saved me again, allowing me to return to the ranks of the working class. In addition to requesting the higher authorities to give me the punishment I deserve, I guarantee to correct my mistakes, make meritorious service to atone for my crimes, and resolutely demand that the government severely punish the cunning merchant Zhang Dewen."

　　杨桂山怎样受了笑里藏刀的奸商的陷害
    潘荻　牟承启
    东北人民政府工业部轻工业管理局所属几个工厂的采买人员，都被奸商张德文用毒辣手段拖下了污浊的泥坑。第四造纸厂的材料员杨桂山就是其中的一个。
    杨桂山原是安东第八造纸厂的材料员，一九五○年四月，被派驻沈阳做采购材料工作。当他来到沈阳时，业务股长曾交给他一个任务：催促商人张德文迅速把承卖的十吨铜运到安东去。这样，杨桂山便认识了这个专门买空卖空、投机倒把的奸商张德文。张德文本是一个没有资本、光靠介绍买卖赚取佣钱的经纪人。由于他善于谄媚、贿赂、拉拢干部，曾获得不少暴利。他承卖给第八造纸厂的十吨铜，便是这样一笔卖空的交易。他自己并没有十吨铜，但看上了这笔买卖的利润很大，于是极力应承了这个买卖，并约定在安东交货。他的意图是想谈成交易后，再贿赂干部先付款，临时去买铜。杨桂山刚来沈阳，不了解这个诡计，于是上了奸商的圈套。
    杨桂山去催货时，奸商张德文满面陪笑，低头哈腰地献殷勤，并说：十吨铜早已发运安东去了，希望早点付钱。接着便请杨桂山上馆子。吃、喝之后，他就逼着杨桂山要款，并挂长途电话给安东造纸八厂。同时拍着杨桂山的肩头说：“这笔买卖赚不少钱，够咱哥儿俩花的。”三天之后，钱果然汇来了。杨桂山不知底细，便把十吨铜的钱，全数付给了张德文。奸商张德文当时便塞给他一千二百余万元（东北币）。过几天之后，八厂来信说：铜只运去三吨。但这时杨桂山已受了贿赂，嘴被封住了。从此，奸商开始对准这个目标，更进一步用糖衣炮弹进攻。
    杨桂山第一次接受了贿赂后，奸商张德文想尽办法让杨桂山到他家住，以便独揽八厂的买卖。开始他带杨桂山去他家玩，并殷勤招待。以后又经常拉杨桂山去，每次都是打酒买肉请吃饭。并且还好象体贴得无微不至似地表示说：“兄弟，你想吃啥？吃鱼？吃肉？……”如果杨桂山三天不去，他便假心假意地去电话说：“兄弟吗？你可把哥哥惦记坏啦！怎么不来了呢？可不要在外边瞎胡闹呀！”不久，张德文打听到杨桂山的老婆在安东，便花言巧语地对杨桂山说：“何不接弟妹来沈阳见见世面呢？吃、住都算你哥哥的。”他又经常甜言蜜语地对杨桂山说：“咱们哥儿俩今天交朋友，就好像生死弟兄。哥哥不光今天这样待你，就是你有不干的那一天，哥哥吃什么穿什么，也叫你吃什么穿什么。”杨桂山竟真的被奸商张德文这些殷勤假话蒙骗了，觉得张德文对他比自己亲哥哥还强。因此张德文说啥话，他都十分听信。
    奸商张德文不仅从感情上取得了杨桂山的信任，他还要从思想上生活上来腐蚀杨桂山，使杨桂山能完全和他同流合污。当杨桂山到他家去时，他故意摆出牛奶、鸡子、白面，显示他的呢料衣服和皮大衣，诱惑地说：“哥哥吃得这样好，穿得这样好，没钱能办到吗？我看你革命白革啦，没钱啥都是白扯。”他又故意讽刺地给杨桂山取个外号叫“破棉袄”，并说：“你再怎么革命，还是破棉袄，哥哥不革命，粳米白面断不了。”同时他还毫不知耻地夸说：“哥哥光老婆就换上十来个啦，只要有钱，兄弟，你要什么样的就有什么样的。”他又常带杨桂山上馆子、逛窑子。就这样逐渐地使杨桂山对资产阶级的腐朽、堕落生活发生了兴趣。
    奸商张德文见杨桂山上了圈套，已完全被他掌握住了，便开门见山地说出了他的用意：“干采买工作可真是个好差事，这要不弄一把，可真是傻瓜。过了这个村可再没这个店啦！”并且他还怂恿杨桂山脱离革命工作说：“等咱们捞上一大把之后，咱哥儿俩带着老婆到天津做买卖去。”
    一九五○年十月，抗美援朝运动开始了，张德文认为机会到了，便向杨桂山造谣说：“兄弟，我看这一回共产党可快完了，咱们借这个好机会赶快捞一把吧！”随后鼓动杨桂山勾结轻工业管理局仓库保管员张成山，盗卖没有记账的物资。并且威胁杨桂山说：“怕什么，早先你都吃过钱的，一不做二不休，哥哥还不是为你好。”杨桂山在奸商的策动下，果真勾结了张成山，由张德文经手，前后共盗卖三次物资，获得二千七百余万元（东北币）。张德文从中窃取了大半。
    一九五一年四月，杨桂山被调到锦州第四厂工作，仍驻沈阳负采购责任。张德文见杨桂山身上还有利可图，对杨桂山仍然是殷勤异常。这时杨桂山已把老婆接到沈阳来了，住在张德文家中。张德文在杨桂山老婆面前，弟妹长、弟妹短地把她当“老太太”一般孝敬。
    但是，奸商像苍蝇一样，哪里有甜的脏的东西，它就向哪儿趋附；一旦这些东西没有了，它便反目他去。
    杨桂山因事回锦州后，一个来月也没有回沈阳。张德文知道杨桂山被派到哈尔滨去工作了，就化个假名跑到哈尔滨去找杨桂山，想找机会做投机买卖。结果和想的完全不一样，杨桂山在那里不是用现款采买，而是由公家调拨。这一下子张德文感到杨桂山没用了，从他身上刮不下“油水”来了，就把原形一现，暴露出资产阶级的更丑恶的面目，耍无赖，向杨桂山要路费，不然就要揭发杨桂山过去盗卖物资的事情。杨桂山被逼迫没办法，虽然自己没钱（过去杨桂山得到的脏款因信任张德文而寄存在张德文家里），只得把公款一百一十万元（东北币）给了张德文。
    又过了一个月，杨桂山由哈尔滨回到沈阳。刚一进张德文的屋门，他的老婆就抱住他大哭起来，悲恸地诉说了这样一段经过：
    奸商张德文自从哈尔滨回来以后，对杨桂山的老婆就完全变了样。他和他老婆整天当着杨桂山老婆的面，痛骂杨桂山说：“杨桂山，我日他祖宗的，把老婆放在我家里，叫我给养活，天下哪有这些好事！”从此，不但叫杨桂山老婆干那些生炉子、煮饭、洗衣服、端尿盆的活；有时候张德文和老婆故意不回家吃饭，家里也不预备米，杨桂山老婆就得挨饿。虽然这样，奸商张德文还觉得“不够本”，又看杨桂山老婆是个乡下女人好欺负，就想从她身上再“捞一把”。于是张德文欺骗杨桂山的老婆说：“弟妹，杨桂山坏良心啦，他在哈尔滨发了财又搞了个女人。他说跟你离婚，我看你别指望他了。”又叫他老婆劝杨桂山的老婆说：“弟妹呀！你心眼活动点，怎的不是活呢。我看你自己找个出路吧！就跟小二（小二是一个常到张德文家去的妓女）干那一行倒不错。”他们就这样阴险地想要把杨桂山老婆推下水去，沦为娼妓。杨桂山的老婆说啥也不答应，只是痛哭，盼望杨桂山有一天能回来。张德文为了达到他那卑鄙无耻的罪恶目的，就采用更毒辣、更阴险的手段：一天晚上，张德文和他老婆假装去看电影，把杨桂山的老婆一个人留在家里。他们走后，暗地叫他一个流氓小舅子偷偷跑进屋里来，想强奸杨桂山的老婆。因为她用力挣扎，并大声叫喊，才把这个流氓吓跑了，没有受到污辱。杨桂山的老婆病了，好几天没能起床；就这样，张德文每天还撵她走。
    杨桂山听他老婆一边哭一边讲完这些事情后，脸都气青了，想要马上到派出所去控告张德文和他小舅子。但是，奸商张德文把眼珠子一瞪向他说：“哼！你还敢控告别人！你是政府工作人员，你贪污受贿不怕犯法吗？”杨桂山一下子就被威胁住了，半天没有吱声，只得叫老婆马上收拾东西搬到旅馆去住。临走时，奸商张德文用“饭钱”的名义，不但敲诈、勒索杨桂山一百多万元人民币和一个金镏子，还野蛮凶暴地把杨桂山的雨衣硬扒了下去。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动猛烈地展开了。杨桂山终于猛醒过来，大胆地向上级坦白了自己过去的错误，并无情地揭发了奸商张德文陷害自己的罪行。他悲愤地说：“从前，我没站稳工人阶级的立场，被奸商张德文陷害了，当了资产阶级的俘虏；今天，共产党、毛主席又把我救活了，使我又回到工人阶级队伍里来。我除了请求上级给我应得的处分外，我保证改正错误，立功赎罪，并且坚决向政府要求严惩奸商张德文。”
