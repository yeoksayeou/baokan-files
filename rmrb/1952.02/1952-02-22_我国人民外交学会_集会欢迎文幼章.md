Attendees included members of the Foreign Affairs Group of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, members of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression, and members of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, including Li Jishen, Chen Shutong, Shen Junru, Shao Lizi, Situ Meitang, Li Siguang, Tao Menghe, Xu Deheng, Xu Baoju, Zhou Gengsheng, Chen Hansheng, Hu Yuzhi, Qian Duansheng, Mei Ru'ao, Zeng Zhaolun, Zhang Jiongbo, Wu Maosun, and more than two hundred others. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, delivered a welcoming speech first. He pointed out that Mr. James Gareth Endicott is not only a fighter for world peace but also a friend of the Chinese people. Then, Mr. James Gareth Endicott delivered a speech in fluent Chinese, stating that the Canadian people's struggle for peace is combined with the struggle for national independence. Now, the control of Canadian economy by American monopoly capital is increasingly intensifying. However, despite the various war propaganda conducted by the United States in Canada, the Canadian peace movement is still expanding day by day. Finally, Mr. James Gareth Endicott, on behalf of the peace-seeking Canadian people, said with full confidence that world peace can be maintained, and the forces of peace will surely defeat war.

The lecture meeting proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere throughout.
