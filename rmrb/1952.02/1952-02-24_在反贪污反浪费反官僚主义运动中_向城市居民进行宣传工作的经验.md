    Experiences in Conducting Propaganda Work Among Urban Residents in the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Campaign
    The Propaganda Department of the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    In Harbin, the propaganda campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy has been conducted among street residents for four or five times since January 21. Each time, the propaganda teams numbered approximately 6,000 people (including Party branch propagandists and temporary school propaganda teams). The campaign primarily used oral propaganda, along with various art forms such as plays, cross-talk, clapper talk, cartoons, comic strips, and slideshows, as well as propaganda tools like radio stations and street blackboards. The basic masses in the city all praised the movement, and "blank households" (those not reached by propaganda) were basically eliminated. Eighty percent of adult residents received education and began to report and expose wrongdoing. The following are some preliminary experiences from this propaganda work:
    I. In promoting the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign among street residents, it is necessary to clearly define the central content and requirements.
    Before the propaganda, although we stipulated the central themes and requirements for the propaganda and compiled a "Propagandist Speech," the purpose was still vague, and the focus was not prominent. In the beginning, the propagandists seemed to think that anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy had to be talked about item by item, and it would be wrong if any item was relaxed. But the result of doing so was that when talking about anti-waste, especially anti-bureaucracy, residents didn't pay much attention. After we discovered these situations, we further clarified that the propaganda campaign against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy for street residents should focus on: First, the crimes of the unscrupulous merchants and how they colluded with cadres, sent in spies, stole state property, and engaged in various illegal acts that harmed the people. This can combine social reporting with the internal struggle within organizations. Second, in publicizing comrades who oppose corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, it is necessary to promote the glory, greatness, and correctness of the Communist Party, and the integrity and selfless service to the people of the People's Government, so that they can report and criticize illegal public officials from the perspective of cherishing the Party and the government. Third, we should instill a new morality and new ethos of hating corruption, despising extravagance, loving the motherland, and advocating integrity in the movement.
    II. Publicizing the crimes of unscrupulous merchants harming people's daily lives makes it easy to mobilize street residents.
    Street residents initially didn't care about the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, and some had many concerns. For example, they said, "The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign is a matter for the cadres," "It's better to do less than to do more," "We see each other every day, it's not easy to deal with neighbors," and so on. After a period of exploration, we felt that publicizing the typical crimes of unscrupulous merchants could best arouse the people's anger. For example, when some propagandists talked about how Li Shouting, an unscrupulous merchant in this city, colluded with cadres to steal coal sales licenses, replaced good coal with bad coal, raised coal prices, and sought exorbitant profits, the masses began to curse. An old lady said, "I spent a lot of effort to buy a ton of coal from him, but it wouldn't light in the stove, so I used it to pave the road." The masses said, "If we don't expose this kind of bad egg, how can we live with it?" Some propagandists talked about the "Zhou Longchuan, a big unscrupulous merchant in Qiqihar," and calculated Zhou Longchuan's theft account for the masses. The villagers got angry as soon as they heard it: "This kid stole so much of our money, he should be shot!" At this time, the propagandist asked again: "Can we ignore such unscrupulous merchants?" The masses immediately said: "We must expose him and let the government deal with him!" The propagandist asked again: "What if he voluntarily and thoroughly confesses?" After discussion, the masses unanimously said: "Then reduce the punishment." In this way, by publicizing examples of crimes by unscrupulous merchants to explain the significance and policies of the movement, less time is spent and the effect is greater.
    III. When promoting to street residents, pay attention to preventing and correcting errors and one-sidedness in propaganda at any time.
    Although the leading organs in Harbin had also explained the key points and precautions of the propaganda level by level, so that the propagandists had a bottom line in their hearts and knew how to carry out the propaganda, it is still necessary to organize inspections, discover problems and biases at any time, and correct and criticize them. For example, some propagandists unanalytically said "No merchant is not treacherous"; when some propagandists praised clean and honest cadres, they only cited too prominent examples in isolation, which were not very convincing. These problems should be resolved at any time, otherwise it will weaken the propaganda effect or cause misperceptions.
    IV. Take the propaganda network as the base and combine it with temporary propaganda teams to implement a thorough "contract responsibility system."
    Propagandists must be fully responsible for their propaganda objects, and they must be responsible for the "propaganda effect." The Second District Committee proposed to the propagandists: "It is not considered complete to finish explaining a problem. Only when a problem is explained 'correctly' and 'thoroughly' is the task completed. If the required purpose is not achieved or deviations are made, 'study it carefully, explain it again, and be responsible to the end.'" This is very correct. Because only in this way can we prevent the propagandist's simple task view and formalism in propaganda.
    The activity area of ​​the propagandists and temporary propaganda teams should preferably be relatively fixed, so that the propagandists can be familiar with the situation of the propaganda objects, and it can be convenient for the residents to approach the propagandists. For example, the propaganda teams in seven of the ten streets in the Fourth District did this. As long as the propaganda task is issued, it can be communicated to every household on the same night.
    At the same time, pay attention to organizing propagandists to study the documents of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, discuss the key points of propaganda, and understand the significance and policies of the movement. During the propaganda, methods such as "double-person fill-in" (that is, A speaks, B and C listen and collect feedback; after A finishes speaking, B and C supplement if there are deviations or the audience does not understand) can be adopted to improve the level of the propagandists and strengthen the propaganda effect.
    In order to truly implement the "contract responsibility system" of propaganda work, it is necessary to organize propagandists to report the situation in a timely manner. Some districts use the method of "Propagandist Registration Form". Each propagandist must fill in the propaganda results, mass reactions, and problems found on the same day, and send them to the District Committee Propaganda Department for research and sorting. The next day before noon, they will be reported to the Conservation Inspection Committee to help the Conservation Inspection Committee understand the situation and provide guidance on the work of the propagandists.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中
    向城市居民进行宣传工作的经验
    中共哈尔滨市委宣传部
    哈尔滨市的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的宣传，从一月二十一日起，已在街道居民中进行了四五次，每次下去的宣传队伍约六千人（包括党支部宣传员和学校临时宣传队）。以口头宣传为主，并运用了演戏、相声、快板、漫画、连环画、幻灯等各种文艺形式和广播电台、街头黑板报等各种宣传工具。全市基本群众对运动无不称赞，空白户基本上消灭了，百分之八十的成年居民受到了教育，开始进行检举密告。在这次宣传工作中有以下几点初步经验：
    一、在街道居民中宣传反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，要明确地规定中心内容和要求。
    宣传前，我们虽规定了宣传的中心和要求，编了
    “宣传员讲话”，但目的仍然模糊；中心不突出。开始，在宣传员的思想上，好像反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义都得一项一项地讲，如果放松了一项都是不对的。但是这样作的结果，就发生了一个问题：讲反浪费、尤其是讲反官僚主义，居民不大注意。我们发现这些情况，才进一步明确认识了对街道居民宣传反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争，应着重宣传：第一，关于奸商的罪恶及如何勾结干部，派入内奸，盗窃国家财产及各种祸害人民的非法行为。这样可以把社会检举和机关内部的斗争结合起来。第二，宣传反对贪污、反对浪费、反对官僚主义的同志，要宣传共产党的光荣、伟大、正确和人民政府的廉洁奉公和全心全意为人民服务的精神，使他们从爱护党和政府的观点出发来检举和批评不法的公务人员。第三，应在运动中灌输仇恨贪污、鄙视奢侈、热爱祖国、崇尚廉洁的新道德新风气。
    二、宣传奸商危害人民日常生活的罪行，容易把街道居民发动起来。
    街道居民开始对反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动不关心，有些人还有很多顾虑。如说：“反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动是干部们的事情”，“多一事不如少一事”，“低头不见抬头见，街坊邻居不好办”等等。经过一段时间的摸索，我们感到：宣传奸商的典型罪恶，最能激起群众的愤恨。如有的宣传员讲到本市奸商李寿廷如何拉拢干部盗取煤炭代销证，以坏煤顶好煤，抬高煤价、牟取暴利的事，群众便纷纷地骂起来。一个老太太说：“我费了不少劲从他那里买了一吨煤，放在炉里不起火，后来就垫道了。”群众说：“这种坏蛋，不检举他还了得吗？”有的宣传员讲“齐齐哈尔大奸商周龙川”的事情，并给群众算了算周龙川的盗窃账，老乡们一听就火了：“这小子偷了咱们多少钱财，简直应该枪毙！”这时宣传员再问：“像这样的奸商，大家说可以不管吗？”群众马上说：“要把他检举出来，叫政府办他！”宣传员又问：“若是他自动彻底坦白了呢？”群众讨论了以后，一致说：“那就减轻处分。”这样，通过宣传奸商犯罪的实例，来解释运动的意义和政策，费得时间少，效果也大。
    三、在向街道居民宣传时，要随时注意防止和纠正宣传中的错误和片面性。
    哈尔滨市的领导机关虽然也曾逐级讲解宣传要点和注意事项，使宣传员心中有底，懂得如何进行宣传；但仍须组织检查，随时发现问题和偏向，加以纠正、批判。如有的宣传员不加分析地讲“无商不奸”；有的宣传员在表扬廉洁奉公的干部时，孤立地仅举太突出的例子，说服性不大。这些问题应该随时加以解决，不然就会减弱宣传效果，或者造成错觉。
    四、以宣传网为基干，结合临时宣传队，实行彻底“包干制”。
    宣传员要对他的宣传对象负责到底，要对“宣传效果”负责。第二区委向宣传员提出：“一个问题讲完了不算完成任务，把一个问题讲‘对’了和讲‘透’了，才算完成任务。如果要求的目的没有达到或是讲出偏差，就要‘研究好了，重新再讲，负责到底’。”这是很对的。因为只有这样，才能防止宣传员的单纯任务观点和宣传中的形式主义。
    宣传员和临时宣传队的活动地区，最好比较固定，这样能使宣传员熟悉宣传对象的情况，能使居民便于和宣传员接近。如第四区十条街中有七条街的宣传队就都是这样做的。只要宣传任务一下去，当天晚上就可以传达到每个居住户。
    同时，要注意组织宣传员学习反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的文件，讨论宣传要点，了解运动的意义和政策。在宣传时可采取“双人补漏”（即甲讲，乙丙傍听并收集反应；甲讲完，有偏差或听众不懂，乙丙补充）等办法来提高宣传员的水平，并加强宣传效果。
    为了真正贯彻宣传工作的“包干制”，要组织宣传员及时反映情况。有的区使用“宣传员登记表”的方法，每个宣传员要把当天的宣传结果、群众反应和发现的问题等填好，送区委宣传部研究整理，次日午前反映到节约检查委员会，借以帮助节约检查委员会了解情况，并对宣传员的工作提出指导意见。
