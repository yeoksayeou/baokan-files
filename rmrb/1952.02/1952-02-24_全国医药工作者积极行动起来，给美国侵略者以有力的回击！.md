    National medical workers actively mobilize to deliver a powerful counterattack against the American invaders!
    Fu Lianzhang, Chairman of the National General Association of Medical Sciences

    The February 22nd report stated that the American invading army, devoid of humanity, attempting to salvage its unsalvageable military defeat, has employed bacterial weapons in Korea. From January 28th to February 17th, a period of twenty days, they have continuously used aircraft to scatter poisonous insects carrying bacteria over the front and rear areas of Korea as many as eight times, plotting to create infectious diseases to slaughter on a large scale the peaceful residents of Korea and the Chinese and Korean People's forces. Such heinous crimes that violate human justice and international law have caused immense indignation among the Chinese and Korean people and all people of conscience in the world. We in the medical community especially cannot tolerate this.

    The duty of us medical workers is to eliminate all bacteria that endanger humanity and ensure human health. But the bloodthirsty American invaders, disregarding the warnings of the people of the world, collude with Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals who should have been brought to justice long ago, manufacture various bacterial weapons to slaughter humans on a large scale, and use captured personnel of the Chinese and Korean People's forces as experimental subjects. This time, they are blatantly and openly waging bacteriological warfare. We accuse them before the world. We have irreconcilable hatred with these bacteriological warfare criminals. We will wipe them out as thoroughly as we would wipe out bacteria. We demand that all people who love peace and cherish human dignity join us in a righteous condemnation of these beasts in human skin, and impose severe sanctions upon them.

    This atrocity by the American invaders once again demonstrates to the world that they are the mortal enemies of the Chinese and Korean people and all peace-loving people. On the one hand, they are doing everything possible to create excuses to unreasonably delay the Korean armistice negotiations; on the other hand, they are using scientific achievements to carry out the most cruel killing. This is the best exposure of their lack of sincerity in conducting armistice negotiations. But the Chinese and Korean people have never been paralyzed or fearful. We will, with even more determination and confidence, carry the war to resist America and aid Korea through to the end. We will not stop until we win complete victory.

    In order to crush the enemy's vicious plot, I, on behalf of the Chinese Medical Association, call on all medical workers in the country to take active action and, together with the people of the whole country, continue to expose the crimes of the American invaders and take strong countermeasures. And standing at our medical posts, we must intensify the publicity and education of epidemic prevention knowledge, improve epidemic prevention technology, produce large quantities of vaccines, and organize large numbers of epidemic prevention teams to the Korean front to give a powerful counterattack to the American invaders' bacteriological warfare. This is our undeniable duty.

    全国医药工作者积极行动起来，给美国侵略者以有力的回击！
    中华医学会总会理事长  傅连暲
    二月二十二日报载，灭绝人性的美国侵略军，妄图挽救其无法挽救的军事惨败，已在朝鲜采用细菌武器作战。自一月二十八日至二月十七日的二十天中，即连续用飞机在朝鲜前线和后方上空撒布带有细菌的毒虫达八次之多，阴谋制造传染病来大规模屠杀朝鲜和平居民及中朝人民部队。这种违反人类正义和国际公法的滔天罪行，中朝人民以及全世界一切有良心的人士无不表示万分愤慨，我们医学界尤其不能容忍。
    我们医学工作者的职责是要消灭一切危害人类的细菌，确保人类的健康。而嗜杀成性的美国侵略者，却不顾全世界人民的警告，勾结早应受到正义裁判的日本细菌战犯，制造多种细菌武器来大规模地屠杀人类，并用中朝人民部队的被俘人员作实验品，这次更明目张胆地公开进行细菌战争。我们向全世界控诉，我们与这些细菌战犯，有不共戴天的仇恨，我们要像扑灭细菌一样把他们扑灭净尽。我们要求一切爱好和平、爱护人类尊严的人们，和我们一起，对这些披着人皮的野兽，予以正义的声讨，给以严厉的制裁。
    美国侵略者此种暴行，再一次向全世界表示，它是中朝人民及一切爱好和平人民的死敌，它一面千方百计地制造藉口蛮不讲理拖延朝鲜停战谈判，一面又利用科学成果进行最残酷的杀人勾当。这是它无丝毫诚意进行停战谈判的最好的揭露。但是中朝人民从未麻痹，从无畏惧，我们将以更加坚定的决心和信心，把抗美援朝进行到底，不获全胜，决不休止。
    为了粉碎敌人的恶毒阴谋，我代表中华医学会号召全国医药工作者，积极行动起来，和全国人民一起，继续揭露美国侵略者的罪恶，采取有力的对策。并站在医药岗位上，加紧防疫知识的宣传教育，提高防疫技术，大量制造疫苗，组织大批防疫队到朝鲜前线给美国侵略者的细菌战以有力的回击。这是我们义不容辞的责任。
    一九五二年二月二十二日
