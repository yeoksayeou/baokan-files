    Beijing Continues Inspections of the Industrial and Commercial Sectors
    Arrest of Eighteen Unrepentant Profiteers

    [This newspaper's report] The Beijing Municipal Committee for the Inspection of Economy and Savings, in consideration of the industrial and commercial sectors' custom of celebrating the Spring Festival, extended the inspection period by ten days, which has now expired. From the 2nd onward, the Committee has dispatched a large number of inspection teams to continue inspections in the industrial and commercial sectors.

    On January 31st, based on the findings of the Municipal Committee for the Inspection of Economy and Savings, the Beijing Municipal People's Government arrested eighteen individuals, including Ji Moru, manager, and Fan Zhizhai, deputy manager, of sixteen factories and shops, including Yi Ji Fuxing Construction Factory, who had committed serious crimes and refused to confess. At the same time, eight illegal industrial and commercial households, including Yi Hua Trading Company, Beihai Construction Factory, Feng Lin Trading Company, Quan Feng Paper Store, Wan Shun He Iron Shop, Si He Grain Store, Lian Chang Electrical Machinery Factory, and Zhi Zhong Asbestos Factory, whose crimes were also serious, but who expressed a willingness to repent and had demonstrated it in practice during the inspection, were released on bail pending further handling.

    The names of the eighteen profiteers from sixteen factories and shops who were arrested and prosecuted this time, as well as the crimes of these criminals, are provisionally announced as follows based on preliminary investigations:

    Ji Moru, manager, and Fan Zhizhai, deputy manager, of Yi Ji Fuxing Construction Factory, have consistently cut corners and embezzled state assets in contracted projects. According to current investigations, these criminals bribed cadres with more than 25 million yuan and embezzled state assets totaling 1,189.8 million yuan. In addition, they evaded taxes amounting to more than 26 million yuan.

    Sun Xingkui, manager of Xing Ji Xie Xing Construction Factory, has been launching frantic attacks on the staff of the People's Government with "sugar-coated bullets" for the past three years. According to preliminary calculations, the amount of state assets stolen due to corner cutting in contracted projects alone reached 360 million yuan. In addition, Sun evaded state taxes of 30 million yuan by not keeping proper accounts.

    Qiao Jingru, manager of Jing Min Construction Factory, bribed more than 30 government employees with over 40 million yuan in 1951 alone. In the engineering projects worth over 1 billion yuan he contracted in one year, he illegally profited 290 million yuan by cutting corners. After this movement began, Qiao called a meeting of factory employees and gave each person 500,000 yuan with the intention of disbanding the factory. During the inspection, Qiao's attitude was stubborn, and he often denied what he had said.

    Zhang Zhirong, manager of Zhi Xin Construction Factory, always bribed officials before undertaking construction projects, then employed his stealing tricks. In 1949, when the factory jointly contracted the grain company's warehouse project with other construction factories, it stole state property worth more than 30 million yuan and embezzled over ten truckloads of timber, from which it made exorbitant profits. In addition, in more than ten other projects, the factory was found to have stolen nearly 120 million yuan in state assets, evaded taxes of more than 28 million yuan, and paid bribes of 4 million yuan based on the books alone.

    Zhang Jingxuan, manager, and Hao Quan, deputy manager, of Xin Dongbei Construction Factory, bribed more than 20 government employees, totaling more than 19 million yuan in RMB equivalent. The two criminals consistently cut corners and stole materials in contracted projects, resulting in a loss of over 540 million yuan in state property.

    Liu Dizhi, manager of Yi Xin Yong Hardware Store, bribed more than 30 cadres over the past three years, equivalent to more than 60 million yuan at current values; he evaded taxes of nearly 400 million yuan by operating as a wholesaler while reporting as a retailer and engaging in off-the-books activities. Liu stole approximately 2 billion yuan in state assets when trading with state agencies. He also illegally sold 45 taels of gold and more than 3,300 silver dollars.

    Hu Ruifu, manager of Ju Tai Cheng Hardware Store, used extremely vicious means to corrupt cadres, repeatedly taking certain government employees to smoke opium and visit prostitutes. More than ten people were corrupted by him, with bribes totaling more than 50 million yuan. According to incomplete statistics, Hu stole approximately 430 million yuan in state property and obtained thirty-one loans from the People's Bank through bribed cadres, which were used for speculation and profiteering. In addition, Hu illegally sold 40 taels of gold and 2,500 silver dollars. Tax evasion amounted to more than 100 million yuan.

    Zhang Zhikun, manager of Xinhua Heating and Iron Factory, consistently cut corners on heating projects contracted from government agencies to obtain illegal profits. According to current investigations, the number of bribes the criminal paid was nearly 14 million yuan, and the illegal profits he obtained reached more than 440 million yuan.

    Wei Shijie, manager of Quan He Cheng Mountain Goods Store, bribed cadres and workers of the grain company with more than 10 million yuan in May and October of last year when signing contracts with the grain company to exchange bricks for mats and grass bags, and to purchase mats with cash. As a result, Wei was able to buy at low prices and sell at high prices, making illegal profits of up to 250 million yuan in one transaction. In addition, the criminal evaded taxes of more than 12 million yuan in 1951.

    Wang Deyuan, deputy manager of Da Bei Electrical Machinery and Wood Factory, consistently used despicable means to lure government employees, bribing more than 20 people with property worth more than 68 million yuan. According to preliminary statistics, he stole state assets worth 580 million yuan by cutting corners. He also stole state assets worth more than 180 million yuan by falsely reporting losses and defrauding interest payments; tax evasion amounted to more than 37 million yuan. He illegally sold gold and made a profit of more than 13 million yuan.

    Wang Mingzi, manager of Xin Xing Long Ming Ji Measurement Instrument Manufacturing Factory, consistently bribed government employees. According to preliminary statistics, the factory evaded taxes of more than 46 million yuan and cut corners worth 2.85 million yuan. During the inspection of the factory, Wang remained cunning and denied his crimes, shifting responsibility.

    Wang Zicai, manager of Yong Feng Leather Store, colluded with illegal merchant Zhang Shutian to steal state property, a serious crime. Wang Zicai used Zhang Shutian's name to evade taxes of more than 180 million yuan. Zhang Shutian personally evaded taxes of more than 70 million yuan. Wang and Zhang used various tricks to steal state assets worth 220 million yuan in transactions with state agencies. In addition, the two criminals disrupted state finances and illegally sold 55 taels of gold.

    Li Fenghe, manager of Xin Mao Automobile Repair Factory, evaded taxes of up to 450 million yuan by operating as a wholesaler, issuing false invoices, and not keeping proper accounts. Li consistently bribed government employees, totaling 68 million yuan. After colluding with cadres, he recklessly cut corners, stole state property, and embezzled large amounts of public funds; the loss of state property as a result is currently incalculable.

    Wang Jinsheng, manager of Long Hua Xiang Silk and Cloth Store, bribed employees of the enterprise company's Xidan branch, including the director. According to preliminary statistics, the criminal embezzled nearly 200 million yuan in public funds and evaded taxes of up to 260 million yuan.

    Deng Zhengpin, manager of Yi Xing Trading Company, consistently engaged in illegal operations, smuggling gold, silver dollars, and U.S. dollars. After liberation, he illegally traded 395 taels of gold and 1,500 silver dollars and U.S. dollars each. In 1950 and 1951, he bribed more than 20 cadres with more than 20 million yuan, evaded state taxes of more than 96 million yuan, and made exorbitant profits of more than 75.8 million yuan in transactions with government agencies.

    Qin Haishan, manager of Hai Shan Industrial Cooperative, bribed cadres and drivers from more than ten government agencies, with more than 30 million yuan already verified. The theft of state assets is temporarily incalculable, but according to Qin himself, it amounts to approximately 300 million yuan. Over the past three years, the tax evasion by this criminal amounts to more than 100.8 million yuan.
