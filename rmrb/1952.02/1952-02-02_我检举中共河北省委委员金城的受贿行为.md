    I Accuse Jin Cheng, Member of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, of Accepting Bribes
    An Zhenying, Organization Department of the CPC Tianjin District Committee

    Editor's Note: During the exposure of the major embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan at the Third Representative Meeting of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC, all the representatives present proposed to the conference that all cadres who had accepted bribes from Liu and Zhang should conduct a thorough self-criticism, write a statement to the Party, and await the Party's investigation. Subsequently, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC made a formal decision based on the opinions of the representatives. However, Comrade Jin Cheng, one of the members of the Hebei Provincial Committee, has written a self-criticism report about his bribery, but he has been evasive, perfunctory, and has not thoroughly exposed the facts of his mistakes and their essence. This attitude is extremely wrong. Now, we are publishing Comrade An Zhenying's material accusing Comrade Jin Cheng, hoping that Comrade Jin Cheng will refer to these materials, conduct a serious self-criticism, thoroughly expose his mistakes, liquidate his bourgeois ideology, and await the Party's investigation.

    According to the materials of the major embezzlement case of Liu Qingshan and Zhang Zishan, it is proved that Jin Cheng, a member of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CPC and Vice Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, is one of those who accepted the most bribes; it also proves that many of the criminal acts of Liu and Zhang are inseparable from Jin Cheng. However, since the launch of the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, Comrade Jin Cheng has been keeping a low profile. Is this the attitude that a senior cadre of the Party and the government should adopt? On December 28th of last year, the Hebei Daily published Comrade Jin Cheng's mobilization report on the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign at the cadre meeting of the provincial government. When I saw this report, I immediately thought: "He is no longer qualified to make this mobilization report because he has not confessed his own problems." Anyone who knows the truth of this matter should have the same feeling as I do. I believe that Comrade Jin Cheng must bravely face his mistakes and dare to expose his mistakes in the newspaper. In order to help Comrade Jin Cheng conduct his self-criticism, I am now reporting some of the materials I know as follows:

    According to the materials revealed by Zhang Zishan's wife, Zhang Zishan once gave Comrade Jin Cheng a swimming watch worth 7 million yuan, a watch worth 5 million yuan to Jin Cheng's wife, a silk raincoat, and 30 boxes of deer antler essence to Lin Tie and Jin Cheng, worth 4.8 million yuan. Of course, there will be things that Zhang Zishan's wife does not know and has not revealed, or even more. If Jin Cheng accepted these things as gifts, then should he consider the source of Liu and Zhang's money? Assuming that he did not consider these things at all, to what extent has this bureaucracy become serious? If Jin Cheng already knew that the origin of Liu and Zhang's money was unclear, then it can only be said that Liu and Zhang's embezzlement and illegal activities were permitted by Jin Cheng, and he wanted to "get a piece of the pie" himself. I think this is an undeniable fact.

    More seriously, Zhang Zishan was personally promoted by Comrade Jin Cheng when Comrade Jin Cheng was the Deputy Secretary of the Jizhong District Party Committee. During the criminal activities of Liu and Zhang, Comrade Jin Cheng not only accepted bribes, but also helped Liu and Zhang suppress comrades who adhered to the Party's principles. At that time, in order to expand their criminal activities, Liu and Zhang retaliated against, attacked, and framed some comrades who dared to adhere to the Party's principles, and arbitrarily promoted some followers and placed them in important positions. These matters were also discussed with Comrade Jin Cheng and approved by Comrade Jin Cheng. On cadre issues, Liu and Zhang did not consult with the Organization Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee, but always said they would consult with Lin (Lin Tie) and Jin (Jin Cheng). In fact, that was the case. This situation is even more suspicious. At that time, Comrade Jin Cheng was only the Minister of Propaganda of the Provincial Committee. Why did they do this? What is the relationship between Jin Cheng and Liu and Zhang? If there are unspeakable secrets, don't they need to be clarified?

    When I was writing this material, I also struggled a bit in my heart; but justice supported me, and the broad masses of cadres and people encouraged and supported me, and Chairman Mao and the policies of the Party Central Committee supported me. I realized that condoning this mistake (or crime) is irresponsible to the Party and the people's cause. I believe that the Party's newspaper, as the mouthpiece of the masses, will publish this material soon.

    我检举中共河北省委委员金城的受贿行为
    中共天津地委组织部  安振英
    编者按：在中共河北省第三次代表会议揭发刘青山、张子善大贪污案时，到会的全体代表，曾向大会提议：所有接受刘、张贿赂的干部，都应该进行深刻检讨，向党写出申明书，听候党的审查。以后，中共河北省委并根据代表们的意见作出正式决定。而河北省委委员之一的金城同志，对于自己的受贿行为，虽然已写过检讨报告，但是躲躲闪闪，不痛不痒，没有彻底揭发自己的错误事实及其本质。这种态度是极端错误的。现在，我们把安振英同志对金城同志检举的材料发表出来，希望金城同志参照这些材料，严肃地进行检讨，彻底揭发自己的错误，清算自己的资产阶级思想，听候党的审查。
    根据刘青山、张子善大贪污案的材料，证明中共河北省委委员、兼任河北省人民政府副主席的金城是受贿最多的一个；同时也证明，刘、张的许多犯罪行为是和金城分不开的。但是反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争展开以来，金城同志一直抱着不声不响的态度，难道这是一个党和政府的高级干部所应该采取的态度么？在去年十二月二十八日河北日报上发表了金城同志在省府机关干部大会上关于反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的动员报告，当我看到这个报告时，立即想到：“他已没有资格作这个动员报告，因为他还没有坦白自己的问题。”凡是了解这个问题真相的人，想来和我有同样的感觉。我认为金城同志必须勇于正视自己的错误，敢于在报纸上揭露自己的错误。为了帮助金城同志进行检讨，现仅将我知道的一些材料检举如下：
    据张子善的妻子揭发的材料，张子善曾送给金城同志价值七百万元的游泳表一块，送给金城的爱人价值五百万元的表一块，丝面雨衣一件，送给林铁、金城二人鹿茸精三十盒，价值四百八十万元。当然张子善的爱人所不知道的和没有揭发出来的还会有，或者很多。这些东西，倘若金城是当作礼物接受的，那么是否要考虑到刘、张的钱的来源？假设根本没有考虑这些，请问这种官僚主义已经严重到什么程度？假若金城已经知道刘、张的钱的来历不明，那只能说，刘、张的贪污违法行为是金城所许可的，是他自己想从中“捞一把”。我认为这是无可争辩的事实。
    更严重的是，张子善是在金城同志任冀中区党委副书记时，被金城同志一手扶植起来的。在刘、张进行罪恶活动的过程中，金城同志不仅接受贿赂，而且帮助刘、张压抑坚持党的原则的同志。当时，刘、张为了扩大其罪恶活动，对一部分敢于坚持党的原则的同志进行报复、打击、陷害，并对一部分尾随者任意提拔，安放在重要工作岗位上，这些事情，也都是和金城同志商讨并经过金城同志许可的。在干部问题上，刘、张不是找河北省委组织部商量，而一说就是找林（林铁）、金（金城）。事实上也是这样。这种情况就越发令人可疑了，当时金城同志仅是省委宣传部长，他们为什么要这样作呢？金城和刘、张究竟是什么关系呢？如果有不可告人的秘密的话，难道还不需要弄清么？
    我在写这个材料时，内心里也曾作了些斗争；但正义支持着我，广大的干部、群众鼓励着我，支持着我，毛主席和党中央的政策支持着我。我认识到对这种错误（或者说是罪恶）的纵容就是对党对人民事业的不负责任。我相信作为群众喉舌的党的报纸，能够很快将此材料发表。
