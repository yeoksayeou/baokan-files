    Local Organizations Should Not Unrestrictedly Break Branches to Build Gate Towers and Memorial Arches
    To the Editor: Many government organizations, troops, schools, groups, and industrial and mining enterprises departments extensively break pine and cypress branches to build gate towers and memorial arches during various commemorative festivals and larger meetings. The amount of branches broken each time is quite staggering, causing extremely serious damage to trees near cities.
    For example, the Benxi County Committee and the County Court of Liaodong Province, among other organizations, felled over thirty trees, leaving only stumps, when they collected pine branches on the mountain in front of Daijiabaozi in Qiaotou District of the county at the end of April 1951 to build a pine gate. The pine branches on Mount Yuntai in Shandong are constantly being broken by government organizations and troops to build gate towers and memorial arches, causing great damage.
    The government is now calling on the country to vigorously increase production and practice economy. This behavior of damaging forests not only destroys the country's forests but also increases many concerns for the masses in afforestation and forest protection work. It is hoped that the vast number of cadres in relevant government organizations, troops, schools, groups, and industrial and mining enterprises departments in various places will love the motherland's forests and stop the behavior of destroying forests. If gate towers and memorial arches need to be built, paper or other simple methods can be used instead of pine, cypress, and other tree branches.

    Editor's Note: In order to protect the forests, this phenomenon of arbitrarily breaking trees must be corrected. During important commemorative festivals, if it is necessary to build some pine and cypress gate towers, branches should also be broken in a planned way, and trees should not be damaged.

### 各地机关团体不应该无限制地采折树枝扎门楼牌坊

    各地机关团体不应该无限制地采折树枝扎门楼牌坊
    编辑同志：许多机关、部队、学校、团体和工矿企业部门，每逢各种纪念节日及较大的会议，就大量采折松柏树枝，扎门楼、牌坊，每次采折的树枝数量相当惊人，城市附近的树木遭受到极严重的破坏。
    例如，辽东省本溪县委员会、县法院等机关团体，因为要扎松门，一九五一年四月底在该县桥头区代家堡子前山上采松枝，把树头砍掉三十多株，只剩下了木桩子。山东云台山上的松枝，不断被机关、部队采折扎门楼、牌坊，破坏很大。
    现在政府号召全国厉行增产节约。这种损害林木的行为，不但破坏了国家的林木，而且给群众增加了许多造林和护林工作的顾虑。希望各地有关机关、部队、学校、团体、工矿企业部门的广大干部，热爱祖国森林，停止破坏林木的行为。如需要扎门楼、牌坊时，可改用糊纸或其他简便办法，来代替松柏等树枝。
    中央人民政府林业部林政司
    编者按：为了保护林木，必须纠正这种任意采折树木的现象。在重要的纪念节日，如果必须扎一些松柏门楼，也应有计划地采折树枝，不能损伤林木。
