Party Life

    In order to widely and deeply mobilize the masses and vigorously launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, Party reporters and propagandists in various parts of Northeast China have led the broad masses of propaganda teams in large-scale propaganda and mobilization, and have achieved initial results. Recently, the representative conferences of propagandists held in Shenyang and Jilin, Liaoxi and other provinces and cities have assigned the reporters and propagandists the task of fighting against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in propaganda; the Propaganda Department of the Harbin Municipal Party Committee held a propaganda meeting, stipulating that each reporter and propagandist of organs, enterprises, and factories should go deep into the masses to conduct anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy propaganda, and issued propaganda materials for propagandists, mobilizing cultural centers in various urban areas to be responsible for writing blackboards, the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles to publish illustrated magazines and popular literary and artistic materials, and cinemas to conduct slide propaganda, etc.; the Propaganda Department of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee has also assigned the reporters and propagandists the work of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy propaganda. The Northeast Daily published an editorial on January 26, requesting Party reporters and propagandists to do the following two aspects of work well: First, concentrate firepower to expose the various criminal acts of bourgeois lawbreakers stealing state property and corrupting state cadres, call on the broad masses of people to expose these bourgeois lawbreakers who undermine the cause of the state and the people, and pay attention to crushing the various tricks, fallacies and various reactionary rumors of bourgeois lawbreakers in the movement in a timely manner. In particular, it is necessary to be good at grasping typical examples for in-depth ideological education, so that the broad masses of people fully understand the decadent and ugly faces of bourgeois lawbreakers, and to make the broad masses of people understand the great political significance of repelling the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie for our national construction cause. Second, introduce the typical examples of those staff members who adhere to the tradition of hard work and simple living, the activists who bravely fight against profiteers, and the new people and new things that have emerged in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, to educate the people, promote righteousness, and establish a new social atmosphere in the movement, in order to more effectively combat the evil spirits of the bourgeoisie, so that those bourgeois bad habits cannot erode the healthy skin of the Party and the working class.
    In the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, local party committees should also strengthen the Party organization's leadership over the propaganda network, appropriately assign work tasks to propagandists, and use Party reporters and propagandists as the backbone to unite a large number of mass propaganda teams and activists in the movement, to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and mobilization work to counterattack the bourgeoisie's offensive, just like in Northeast China.

    在反贪污反浪费反官僚主义运动中应充分发挥党的宣传网的作用
    为了广泛深入地发动群众，大张旗鼓地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，东北各地党的报告员和宣传员，已带动广大的群众的宣传队伍进行了大规模的宣传鼓动，并已获得了初步的成效。最近沈阳和吉林、辽西等省市召开的宣传员代表大会，都给报告员、宣传员布置了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义宣传的斗争任务；哈尔滨市委宣传部召开了宣传会议，规定各机关、企业、工厂的每个报告员和宣传员都要深入群众进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义宣传，并印发宣传员讲话材料，动员各市区文化馆负责编写黑板报，市文学艺术界联合会出画刊及通俗文艺材料，影院进行幻灯宣传等；鞍山市委宣传部也都向报告员和宣传员布置了反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义宣传的工作。东北日报在一月二十六日发表了社论，要求党的报告员和宣传员做好以下两方面的工作：一、集中火力揭露资产阶级不法分子盗窃国家资财、腐蚀国家干部的种种罪恶行为，号召广大人民群众起来检举这些破坏国家和人民事业的资产阶级不法分子，及时注意粉碎资产阶级不法分子在运动中的各种花招、谬论和各种反动谣言。特别要善于抓住典型事例进行深入的思想教育，使广大人民充分认识资产阶级不法分子的腐朽丑恶的面目，并要使广大人民了解击退资产阶级猖狂进攻对于我们国家建设事业的重大政治意义。二、介绍那些坚持坚苦朴素传统的工作人员，勇敢和奸商斗争的积极分子，以及在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争中涌现出的新人新事的典型事例，向人民群众进行教育，发扬正气，在运动中树立新的社会风气，以便更有力地打击资产阶级的邪气，让那些资产阶级的恶习无法侵蚀党和工人阶级健康的肌肤。
    各地党委在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，也应该像东北那样，加强党组织对宣传网的领导，适当地分配宣传员工作任务，运用党的报告员和宣传员，作为骨干来团结大量的群众宣传队伍和运动中的积极分子，进行广泛深入的反击资产阶级进攻的宣传鼓动工作。
