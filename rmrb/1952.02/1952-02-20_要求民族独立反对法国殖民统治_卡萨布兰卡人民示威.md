Xinhua News Agency, 19th Dispatch from Casablanca: In Casablanca, the largest port in French-controlled North African Morocco, large demonstrations opposing French colonial rule and demanding national independence have recently taken place.

On the 17th, five thousand Moroccan patriots, in order to express their will for national independence to the Latin American representatives attending the United Nations General Assembly who were visiting Casablanca, marched towards the French Governor's Office, where the Latin American representatives were being entertained, chanting slogans against French colonial rule and demanding national independence. The French colonial authorities tried every means to prevent the demonstrating masses from meeting with the representatives of Latin American countries, and dispatched a large number of military police, who opened fire on the demonstrating masses, resulting in a bloody incident. However, the heroic Moroccan patriots finally met with the representatives of Latin American countries on the pier and personally handed over propaganda materials expressing their will to break free from the colonial yoke to the representatives.

The unstoppable Moroccan national independence movement has increasingly and powerfully shaken the foundation of French colonial rule. Panicked, the French colonialists are adopting increasingly intensified policies of suppression. Recently, the French colonial authorities have frantically arrested leaders of the Moroccan Communist Party and many Moroccan patriots. After the patriotic people of Casablanca held demonstrations on the 17th, the colonial authorities hastily dispatched a large number of troops to Casablanca overnight in an attempt to strengthen the suppression of the Moroccan people.

    要求民族独立反对法国殖民统治
    卡萨布兰卡人民示威
    【新华社十九日讯】卡萨布兰卡消息：在法属北非摩洛哥的第一大港卡萨布兰卡，最近又举行了反对法国殖民统治、要求民族独立的大示威。
    十七日，五千摩洛哥爱国者为了向正在访问卡萨布兰卡的拉丁美洲各国出席联合国大会代表表达他们要求民族独立的意志，高呼着反对法国殖民统治、要求民族独立的口号，列队向正在款待拉丁美洲各国代表的法国总督府进发。法国殖民当局想尽办法来阻止示威群众和拉丁美洲各国的代表们见面，并且调来大批军警，向示威群众开枪，酿成血案。但是，英勇的摩洛哥爱国者终于在码头上和拉丁美洲各国的代表们见了面，亲自把表达他们要求摆脱殖民枷锁的意志的宣传品交给了代表们。
    不可遏止的摩洛哥民族独立运动，已越来越有力地动摇了法国殖民统治的基础。吓慌了的法国殖民者正在采取变本加厉的镇压政策。最近一个时期以来，法国殖民当局已疯狂地逮捕了摩洛哥共产党领袖和许多摩洛哥爱国者。卡萨布兰卡爱国人民在十七日举行示威后，殖民当局又慌忙星夜把大批军队调到卡萨布兰卡，力图加强对摩洛哥人民的镇压。
