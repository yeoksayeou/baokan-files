    The People of the Middle and Near East Struggling for National Liberation
    --Materials for the "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism"
    "Down with American and British Imperialists!" This angry cry resounds throughout the Middle East and Near East. The people of the Middle and Near East, gasping under the yoke of imperialism for decades, from Iran to Tunisia, have raised the banner of national liberation and launched a vigorous anti-imperialist struggle.
    The Middle East and Near East refer to a vast region in southwestern Asia and at the junction of Europe, Asia, and Africa. This region has abundant mineral and agricultural products; the reserves of oil are particularly rich, accounting for 40% to 50% of the total oil reserves of all capitalist countries. Therefore, this region has great economic and strategic value. Many countries here have been colonies and protectorates of British and French imperialism since the late 19th century. Britain alone plundered more than 300 million tons of oil from Iran, obtaining huge profits. After the Second World War, the forces of American imperialism also actively invaded this region, gradually squeezing out Britain and France and seizing the main dominant position. American and British imperialism frantically carried out economic plunder and political control over the countries of the Middle and Near East, and built a large number of military bases here, attempting to turn the Middle and Near East into a strategic bridgehead for launching a new war.
    Under the colonial rule of imperialism, the people of the Middle and Near East lived a miserable life. Eighty percent of the people here are illiterate, and workers have to work twelve to sixteen hours a day, but their wages are not enough to support their families. Iranian oil workers live in dirty mud huts without water or lights; many live in cellars; in some places, workers live in malaria-prone wet areas, mainly eating a type of worm found in sea mud. Among the 14.5 million agricultural population in Egypt, 12 million are poor tenant farmers and hired laborers; the rent is as high as 80% of the net income. The average life expectancy of Egyptians is only twenty-seven years. There are more than two million unemployed people in Turkey, and six million out of 16 million farmers have no land, and two million are in debt; on average, only one out of every 150 farmers has his own plow. In 1950, more than 300,000 children starved to death in Turkey.
    In order to get rid of these heavy shackles of slavery, the people of the Middle and Near East have never ceased their struggle against the imperialists. After the Second World War, the birth of the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe, the victory of the Chinese people's liberation struggle, and especially the heavy blow inflicted by the Chinese and Korean people on the American aggressors in Korea, greatly encouraged the people of the Middle and Near East. Since the Iranian people's struggle for oil nationalization began last year, the national liberation movement of the people of the Middle and Near East has developed vigorously.
    At the beginning of last year, under the call of the Iranian working class party - the People's Party, the Iranian people launched the "Oil Nationalization Movement." From March, oil workers in the Abadan refinery, textile workers in Isfahan, and students and citizens in Tehran, successively held strikes, class boycotts, and demonstrations. They resolutely demanded that the government immediately recover the "Anglo-Iranian Oil Company," the main plundering institution of Britain in Iran, and the American oil industry on the Bahrain Islands. Under the strong pressure of the Iranian people, the Iranian government passed a bill to nationalize the oil industry and recovered the "Anglo-Iranian Oil Company." In January this year, the Iranian government ordered the closure of all British consulates in Iran. However, following the expulsion of British imperialism, the aggressive forces of the United States closely followed and extended into Iran. American imperialism is attempting to build naval and air force bases in Iran and to control Iran's oil industry through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Iranian people resolutely oppose the shameless aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism. In this great struggle, Iranian youth and students, regardless of police persecution, have further united. In November last year, nearly forty Iranian youth organizations of various natures formed the "National Preparatory Committee for the Protection of Iranian Youth Rights." Together with all the Iranian people, they are now engaged in a more arduous and heroic struggle against the aggression of American and British imperialism, for national independence and the democratic rights of the people.
    Following Iran closely, the Egyptian people also launched a large-scale anti-imperialist struggle. On August 26 last year, workers, students, and citizens in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, held demonstrations demanding the abolition of the unequal Anglo-Egyptian treaty. Their actions immediately received the support of the entire Egyptian people. People from all walks of life in Cairo, Alexandria, and other places continued to hold demonstrations, and Egyptian workers in the Suez Canal Zone also refused to work for the British army. Under the strong demands of the people, the Egyptian parliament passed decrees abolishing the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the 1899 Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement on Sudan, demanding that the British army withdraw from Egyptian territory. However, with the support of the United States, British imperialists continued to send troops to the Canal Zone and bloodily massacred the Egyptian people. The British army's atrocities aroused great anger among the Egyptian people, and unprecedented large-scale demonstrations broke out continuously in various parts of Egypt; many young people joined the guerrillas and attacked the British aggressors. At the same time, the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey put forward the proposal to establish a "Middle East Joint Command," the purpose of which was to stop the national liberation movement of the Middle Eastern Arab countries and turn them into their own obedient tools of aggression. The Egyptian people forced the government to reject this plan, delaying its implementation. The new upsurge of the Egyptian national liberation movement has caused extreme panic among American and British imperialists, and they have used all despicable and shameless methods to destroy it. On January 27, Egyptian King Farouk, under the planning of American and British imperialists, dismissed Prime Minister Nahas and ordered Maher to form a new government. Subsequently, the Egyptian government declared martial law throughout the country and arrested patriots on a large scale. At the same time, the Egyptian government openly expressed its willingness to resume Anglo-Egyptian negotiations and to consider joining the "Middle East Command." Now, the anti-imperialist struggle of the Egyptian people has obviously encountered new difficulties, but the shameless conspiracy of imperialism will only make the Egyptian people further recognize their enemies and more resolutely fight stubbornly for national independence.
    Under the influence of the Iranian and Egyptian national liberation movements, the Iraqi government, driven by the people, demanded that Britain abolish the unequal treaty of 1930. The people of Israel fought against joining the "Middle East Command." The people of Syria, Lebanon, and other countries also rose up in response to the struggle of the people of Iran and Egypt, opposing the conspiracy of American and British imperialism to turn their countries into war bases. The youth and students of these countries, regardless of police persecution, held many demonstrations.
    The fire of the national liberation struggle of the people of the Middle and Near East is burning fiercely under the feet of the imperialists, and this fire cannot be extinguished by any violence. However, their struggle is still long-term and arduous. But the experience of the Chinese people proves that as long as they can unite and persist in the struggle, victory will surely belong to the people of the Middle and Near East.

    为民族解放而斗争的中、近东人民
    ——“反对殖民制度斗争日”资料
    “打倒美英帝国主义者！”这愤怒的呼声响遍了整个中东和近东。从伊朗到突尼斯，在帝国主义桎梏下喘息了几十年的中、近东人民，已经高举着民族解放的大旗，发动了轰轰烈烈的反帝斗争。
    中东和近东是指亚洲西南部和欧、亚、非三洲交界处的一片广阔的地区。这里有着大量的矿产和农产品；石油的储藏量尤其丰富，占全部资本主义国家藏油量的百分之四十到五十。因此，这一地区在经济上和战略上都具有重大的价值。这里的许多国家从十九世纪末期起就成为英法帝国主义的殖民地和保护国。英国仅仅在伊朗就掠夺了三亿吨以上的石油，获得了巨额的利润。第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义的势力也积极地侵入了这个地区，逐渐排挤英法而夺取了主要的统治地位。美英帝国主义对中、近东各国疯狂地进行着经济掠夺和政治上的控制，并在这里建设大量军事基地，企图把中、近东变成发动新战争的战略桥头堡。
    在帝国主义的殖民统治下，中、近东人民过着悲惨的生活。这里的人民百分之八十都不识字，工人每天都要做十二到十六小时的工作，工资却少得不够一家人过活。伊朗的石油工人住在肮脏的小泥屋里，没有水也没有灯；许多人住在地窖里；有的地方工人们住在疟疾流行的潮湿地区，吃的主要是从海泥里找出来的一种虫类。埃及一千四百五十万农业人口中，有一千二百万是贫苦的佃农和雇农；地租高到纯收益的百分之八十。埃及人的平均寿命只有二十七岁。土耳其的失业者超过两百万，一千六百万农民中有六百万人没有土地，二百万人负着债；平均每一百五十家农民只有一家有自己的犁。一九五○年，土耳其饿死了三十多万儿童。
    中、近东人民为了解脱这沉重的奴隶镣铐，从来没有停息过对帝国主义者的斗争。第二次世界大战以后，东欧人民民主国家的诞生，中国人民解放斗争的胜利，特别是中朝人民在朝鲜给予美国侵略者的惨重打击，使中、近东人民得到了极大的鼓舞。从去年伊朗人民的石油国有化斗争开始，中、近东人民的民族解放运动蓬勃地发展起来了。
    去年年初，在伊朗工人阶级的政党——人民党的号召下，伊朗人民展开了“石油国有化运动”。从三月起，阿巴丹炼油厂的石油工人，伊斯法罕的纺织工人，德黑兰的学生和市民，都风起云涌地相继举行罢工、罢课和示威游行。他们坚决要求政府立即收回英国在伊朗的主要掠夺机构“英伊石油公司”，和美国在巴林群岛上的石油工业。在伊朗人民的强大压力下，伊朗政府通过了石油工业国有化的法案，并收回了“英伊石油公司”。今年一月间，伊朗政府又下令封闭了英国在伊朗的一切领事馆。但是随着被驱逐出去的英帝国主义，美国的侵略势力紧跟着就伸入伊朗。美帝国主义正企图在伊朗建设海空军基地，并通过国际复兴开发银行来控制伊朗的石油工业。伊朗人民坚决反对美帝国主义的无耻侵略阴谋。在这个伟大的斗争中，伊朗青年和学生不顾警察的迫害，进一步团结了起来。在去年十一月间，近四十个各种不同性质的伊朗青年团体，组成了“保卫伊朗青年权利全国筹备委员会”。他们和全体伊朗人民在一起，现在正在为反对美英帝国主义的侵略，为民族独立和人民的民主权利而进行更艰苦更英勇的斗争。
    紧接着伊朗，埃及人民也展开了规模巨大的反帝斗争。去年八月二十六日，埃及首都开罗的工人、学生和市民举行示威游行，要求废除英埃不平等条约。他们的行动立即得到全埃及人民的支持。开罗、亚历山大港等地各阶层人民不断举行示威游行，苏彝士运河区的埃及工人也拒绝替英军工作。在人民的强烈要求下，埃及议会通过了废除一九三六年英埃条约和一八九九年英埃共管苏丹协定的法令，要求英军撤离埃及领土。但是英帝国主义者在美国支持之下，竟继续向运河区增兵，并且血腥屠杀埃及人民。英军的暴行激起了埃及人民的极大愤怒，埃及各地连续爆发空前规模的示威游行；许多青年参加游击队，袭击英国侵略者。与此同时，美、英、法、土四国提出了设立“中东联合司令部”的建议，其目的是要制止中东阿拉伯国家的民族解放运动，并把它们变成自己的驯顺的侵略工具。埃及人民迫使政府拒绝接受这个计划，使这个计划迟迟未能实现。埃及民族解放运动的新高涨，使美英帝国主义者极为恐慌，它们用尽一切卑鄙无耻的办法来加以破坏。一月二十七日，埃及国王法鲁克在美英帝国主义者的策划下罢黜了首相纳哈斯，并命马赫尔筹组新政府。接着，埃及政府就下令全国戒严，并大肆逮捕爱国者。与此同时，埃及政府公开表示愿意恢复英埃谈判，并愿意考虑加入“中东司令部”的问题。现在，埃及人民的反帝斗争显然遭遇了新的困难，但是，帝国主义的无耻阴谋，只有使埃及人民进一步认清楚他们的敌人，更坚决地为民族独立而顽强地斗争。
    在伊朗、埃及民族解放运动的影响下，伊拉克政府在人民推动下要求英国废止一九三○年的不平等条约。以色列人民为反对参加“中东司令部”进行了斗争。叙利亚、黎巴嫩等国人民也纷纷起来响应伊朗、埃及人民的斗争，反对美英帝国主义想把他们的国家变为战争基地的阴谋。这些国家的青年和学生，不顾警察的迫害，举行了多次的示威游行。
    中、近东人民的民族解放斗争的烈火正在帝国主义者的脚下熊熊地燃烧起来，这烈火是任何暴力都扑灭不了的。尽管因此，他们的斗争还是长期的、艰苦的。但是中国人民的经验证明，只要能够团结一致，坚持斗争，胜利一定是属于中、近东人民的。
