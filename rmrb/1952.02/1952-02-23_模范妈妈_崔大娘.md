    "Model Mother" Aunt Cui

    Editor: We are a group of volunteer army convalescents who returned to China nearly a year ago. During our convalescence, resident Aunt Cui has been taking care of us like her own children. When the comrades in the whole hospital mention Aunt Cui, they all affectionately call her "Model Mother."

    When we first arrived at the hospital, Aunt Cui brought her child and ran to the hospital, asking to wash our clothes. The person in charge comforted her, saying, "You are old and have a child..." Before he could finish speaking, she said unhappily, "This is my intention. I also want to resist America and aid Korea." She personally ran to the ward and picked up a bundle of our clothes, still stained with blood, from under our beds and took them back to wash. After washing the clothes, she dried them by the fire for fear of delaying us from wearing them. When there were too many clothes, she even mobilized her husband, Cui Qiming (a worker in the train section), to help her wash them. Sometimes she stayed up all night, even neglecting to take care of her nursing child. She said, "Taking good care of the volunteer army's wounded and sick is adding strength to resisting America and aiding Korea."

    In the summer, when we were enjoying the cool air under the big trees, Aunt Cui saw us and said kindly, "It's hot outside. My room is cool. Come in and sit down." At first, everyone felt a little embarrassed. As time went on, Aunt Cui's house became our "reception station." Sometimes when she was not at home, we would watch the door and light the fire for her. In winter, she would let us sit on her heated kang. Whenever someone said their wound hurt, she would immediately cover the comrades' wounds with the quilt her child was using. She was busy day and night mending our clothes, sewing socks, and taking apart and washing quilts. Until now, she is so busy that she hasn't even sewn her own cotton pants. We also care for Aunt Cui as we would our own mother. Sometimes we would take over her work and let her rest for a while. She would immediately say:

    "What am I afraid of being tired? You aren't afraid of shedding blood!" Aunt Cui's maternal love for us made us shed tears of gratitude from time to time. On the eve of the New Year, as soon as her husband came back from work, she asked him to go to the city to buy four cans of tea to give to us. She said, "Only in this way can I say that I have done my part!"

    Now, most of us are about to be discharged from the hospital. Everyone gave her a banner that said "Model Mother". Our respect is gathered on this banner. Here, we once again assure our dear "Mother": We will resolutely complete the tasks assigned to us by our superiors!

    “模范妈妈”崔大娘
    编辑同志：我们是归国将近一年的志愿军休养员。在休养期中，居民崔大娘一直像照顾自己的孩子一样地照顾着我们。全院的同志们一提起崔大娘，都亲热地叫她“模范妈妈”。
    我们刚到医院时，崔大娘便抱着孩子跑到医院里，要求给我们洗衣服。负责同志安慰她说：“你年纪大了，又有孩子……”还没有等他说完，她便不高兴地说：“这是我的心意，我也要抗美援朝呀。”她亲自跑到病房，把我们床底下放的还带着血的衣服，拣了一包袱回去洗。衣服洗好后，怕耽误我们穿，她便用火烤干。衣服多了，她还动员自己的丈夫崔启明（列车段的工人）帮助她洗，有时她一夜都不睡觉，连自己正吃奶的孩子也顾不得照顾。她说：“把志愿军伤病员照顾好，就是给抗美援朝增添了力量。”
    夏天，我们在大树下面乘凉，被崔大娘看见了，她和蔼地说：“外边热，我的屋里凉快，快到屋里坐着去。”起初大家都感觉有点不好意思，日子久了，崔大娘的房子就成了我们的“招待站”。有时她不在家，我们就替她看门、生火。冬天，她让我们坐在她烧好了的热炕头上。一听到有人说伤口痛，她立即把自己孩子正盖着的被子，复在同志们的伤口上。她日夜都在忙着给我们补衣服、缝袜子、拆洗被子，直到现在她自己忙得连棉裤还没有缝上。我们也像痛爱自己的妈妈一样地关怀着崔大娘，有时我们把她的活夺过来，让她休息一会，她立刻说：
    “我累点怕什么，你们流血都不怕！”崔大娘对我们慈母般的爱，使我们不时地淌出感激的热泪。新年前夕，她丈夫刚下班回来，她便让他到城里去买了四桶茶叶送给我们。她说：“这样，我才算尽了一点心意！”
    现在，我们大部分都要出院了。大家送给了她一面“模范妈妈”的锦旗。我们崇敬的心都聚集在这面锦旗上。这里，我们再向亲爱的“妈妈”保证：坚决完成上级所交给我们的任务！
