    The Peace Movement in Latin America
    —Report at the Welcome Meeting of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs on February 7, 1952
    By Jorge Amado, Brazilian Writer and Winner of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening International Peace"
    Latin America is a continent with a vast area, containing twenty republics, all of which were formerly colonies of Spain, Portugal, or France. Although these countries are far from China, the people of Latin America are concerned about the Chinese people. The people of Latin America are engaged in a struggle against imperialism, especially against American imperialism, that is, a struggle for peace and for the liberation of their homelands.

    These republics in Latin America formally broke away from colonial rule during the 19th century. In 1804, the Republic of Haiti was the first to break free from foreign rule; in 1902, the Republic of Cuba was the last to gain independence. During this hundred-year period, other republics successively shook off the shackles of colonial rule. The independence of Latin American countries was bought at the cost of countless people's blood and sacrifices. Initially, the people of Latin America had great hopes, believing that the independence of their homelands would be the beginning of an era of prosperity, true democracy, progress, and freedom, but these hopes were soon extinguished. The people of Latin America only saw new ruling classes replace the old Spanish or Portuguese colonial rulers. The landlord class betrayed the people and the homeland, and the laws were not made by the people but by the representatives and lackeys of Anglo-American imperialism. In fact, these twenty republics of Latin America never gained true independence and autonomy; they were merely vassal states or semi-colonial countries, exploited at will by the bosses of the London "City" and Wall Street.

    The history of Latin American countries for more than a hundred years is a history of oppression, plunder, terror, and exploitation of the people. Generally speaking, the governments that seized power were bloody dictatorships, serving only their imperialist masters. Imperialism could replace the dictators of various countries at will; imperialism considered the best governments to be those that oppressed the people the most, disregarded national interests, and sold their homeland's property the cheapest. These reactionary governments were merely puppets serving imperialism, and their hands were stained with the blood of the people.

    Comrades, you are familiar with this kind of government; in Latin America, in our countries, we have a series of little Chiang Kai-sheks, called Vargas (President of Brazil) or Perón (President of Argentina); called Videla (President of Chile) or Trujillo (President of the Dominican Republic). They rule larger countries, such as Brazil or Argentina; smaller countries, such as Panama or Nicaragua. They have one thing in common: a deep hatred for the people and absolute obedience to imperialism.

    In this vast continent of Latin America, countless treasures are hidden. These treasures are enough for the people living on the continent to live a happy life; however, these treasures do not belong to our people but are all plundered and seized by imperialism. Today, these treasures are being used to prepare for wars of aggression against the Soviet Union, New China, and the people's democratic countries.

    If we look at a map of Latin America, we can see the geographical importance of Latin America. American imperialism has always regarded Latin America as its sphere of influence and its most reliable warehouse. In 1947, American imperialism and Latin America signed the "Rio de Janeiro Treaty," which was the precursor to the Atlantic Pact. The "Rio de Janeiro Treaty" stipulated that all Latin American countries must support the adventurous war policy of American imperialism. To understand how American imperialism uses this treaty to control Latin American countries, one only needs to look at the voting in the United Nations General Assembly: the twenty Latin American countries mechanically voted in favor of all American proposals and voted against all proposals that conflicted with the wishes of American imperialism.

    However, the actions of the governments of Latin American countries do not mean that the people of all countries agree with the American war preparation policy; on the contrary, the people of Latin America and the governments of these twenty countries are very different, and they are completely incompatible. The people of Latin America demand peace, a better life, national independence, and the expulsion of imperialists. The people of Latin America love the Soviet Union, New China, Korea, and the people's democratic countries. In Latin America, war propaganda is rampant, and all newspapers, radio stations, cinemas, theaters, etc., belonging to American imperialism are promoting war. They spread rumors and slander the Soviet Union, New China, and the people's democratic countries every day. In most countries of Latin America, progressive newspapers are prohibited from publishing. Even in those countries that have progressive newspapers, such as Brazil and Cuba, they are subjected to barbaric persecution. For example, the president of the "Masses Daily" in Rio de Janeiro was recently sentenced to two years in prison by the reactionary government. Nevertheless, the new war propaganda of imperialism still cannot deceive the people of Latin America. In Latin America, the power of truth shines like the sun. The eyes of the people of Latin America are sharp, and they can distinguish between right and wrong. They see that the wealth of their homeland no longer belongs to them but falls into the hands of Americans; they see that it is not the Soviets, Chinese, or Koreans who occupy and exploit their mines and oil fields, but the Americans; they see that it is not the Soviets or Chinese who support the landlords and obstruct land reform, but the Americans; they see that it is not the Soviets or Chinese who build military bases, naval bases, and air force bases in their countries, but the Americans; they see that the responsibility for the vast majority of illiteracy in their countries does not belong to the Soviets or Chinese, but to the Americans; they see that it is not the Soviets or Chinese who interfere in their countries' internal affairs and support bloody dictatorships, but the Americans; they see that it is not the Soviet red flag or the Chinese five-star red flag that appears as conquerors and flies over their land, but the American Stars and Stripes. In the face of these facts, all war propaganda falls apart. In the face of these facts, how can the people believe the propaganda of American imperialism?

    All of this shows that the peace movement in Latin America is expanding day by day; all of this shows that the hatred of the people of Latin America for American imperialism is growing day by day; all of this also shows that the movement for national independence and liberation in Latin American countries is strengthening day by day.

    The new war crisis has clearly intensified the oppression of our Latin American countries by American imperialism. The Paraguayan Communist Party recently published a document analyzing the current situation. The document stated: The new war crisis will reduce Latin American countries from the status of vassal states to true colonies of the United States. Latin American countries have gradually lost their independence, and American imperialism dominates our countries politically, economically, and culturally.

    Our mines are developed jointly by the American bourgeoisie and the ruling classes of our countries. In the various ministries and commissions of the governments of Latin American countries, there are organizations of mixed committees; in fact, everything is controlled by the Americans. In the various ministries and commissions of the government, our ministers are merely lackeys of American imperialism. Our factories are closing down one after another due to American aggression and competition. The same is true in cultural undertakings, where the Minister of Education is completely obedient to American imperialism. The schools are carrying out enslaved education, spreading the American way of life. To give a typical example: in some Latin American countries, our people have black ancestry, but there is no racial discrimination; now the United States is importing their "civilization" of racial discrimination into our countries.

    However, the people of Latin America despise this barbaric American-style civilization. In every Latin American country, anti-imperialist ideas have emerged widely. The people of Latin America, led by the working class, have joined the great struggle to defend world peace. The influence of the Communist Parties of Latin American countries is expanding day by day. In some Latin American countries, such as Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Venezuela, and Mexico, the movement for national independence and liberation is developing.

    We can say that the peace movement in Latin American countries has been developing smoothly since the Latin American Peace Conference was held in Mexico in 1949. It should be especially noted that the first Latin American Peace Conference in 1949 was held in Mexico, which American imperialism considers its most reliable base. At that time, the U.S. State Department used great pressure to prohibit the convening of the conference, but this conspiracy ultimately failed. At that time, the peace movement in Latin America was still limited to a narrow scope, and only the Communist Parties of various countries and more progressive people participated in the conference. However, if we think about the fact that the people of Latin America have never been directly affected by war, the peace conference can still be held, and we can know the great significance of the conference.

    At that time, many people believed that if a third world war broke out, Latin American countries could strive for complete independence. This idea made it difficult to promote and develop the peace movement. The American imperialism's war of aggression against Korea on June 25, 1950, fundamentally changed this situation. A part of the Latin American people who were full of illusions woke up. The people of Latin America clearly recognized:

    (1) The war is not as far away from Latin America as they previously thought. Because after American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, it forced Latin American countries to send troops to Korea to fight.

    (2) The people of Latin America also understood that American imperialism regards the movement for national independence and national liberation as aggression. The Korean War is a good proof.

    Due to the awakening of people from all walks of life, the peace movement in Latin American countries has flourished. People who did not participate in the peace movement in the past are now enthusiastically joining this great movement. People from various parties, religious circles, cultural circles, and ordinary citizens in Latin American countries all oppose participating in the Korean War. In order to strengthen and deepen the peace movement, Latin America is currently preparing to hold the Second Peace Conference. This conference was initiated by many well-known figures in Latin America and will be held in Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, in March this year. The Brazilian government has ordered the prohibition of the convening of this conference, but I believe that the broad masses of the people of Latin America will say: "The Second Peace Conference must be held."

    The development of the peace movement is not balanced in the countries of Latin America. In countries where the peace forces are stronger, such as Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Argentina, Guatemala, Mexico, and Uruguay, the peace movement has achieved legal status. In countries where the peace forces are weaker, such as the small republics in South America ruled by fascist regimes, Paraguay and Bolivia, the peace movement is illegal and prohibited.

    But, in any case, one thing is certain. Although the American imperialist war-mongers have used violent pressure to demand that Latin American countries send troops to Korea to fight for them, so far only Colombia has sent a thousand soldiers to be cannon fodder. Other Latin American countries, due to the opposition of the broad masses of the people, have prevented their governments from sending troops to Korea. Even in Colombia, since the first batch (one thousand people) left, although American imperialism has demanded that more people be sent, the government has been unable to send troops again due to the protests of the people.

    Allow me to talk to you about the situation of the Brazilian peace movement:

    Brazil is the largest republic on the Latin American continent. In the world, except for the Soviet Union and China, Brazil has the largest land area. Brazil has an area of nearly nine million square kilometers and a population of fifty-five million. Brazil has countless treasures, Brazil has a wide variety of very rich mineral resources, Brazil has fertile land, but the Brazilian people live a very poor life under the oppression and exploitation of the feudal landlord class and American imperialism. We can say that Brazil's natural wealth almost entirely belongs to the imperialists, and the domestic industry completely falls into the hands of foreign imperialists. The electrical industry, mines, transportation, meat food industry, and foreign trade, such as coffee and cocoa, completely fall into the clutches of American imperialism. The vast expanse of land belongs to a small group of landlords. Two-thirds of the Brazilian population lives in rural areas, but they have no land. They rent land from landlords to cultivate. Brazilian farmers live an unimaginable inhuman life. The Brazilian countryside is very backward, and because labor is very cheap, there are no machines to cultivate at all. In some places, farmers have never seen coins, because they work hard all their lives and only get a little food that is not enough to eat. As for rural sanitation, it is unnecessary to mention it. Infectious diseases, such as lung disease, leprosy, smallpox, and cholera, are very prevalent, and the infant mortality rate is the highest in the world. In the countryside, illiteracy accounts for 82 percent of the rural population. There are no laws to protect poor farmers and farm workers.

    In Brazil, we have three million industrial workers, and these three million workers are concentrated in several large cities in the south. Although Brazil is a country that produces raw materials, Brazil does not have heavy industry, and all raw materials are exported to the United States. The most important of our industries is the textile industry, but we use outdated machines. Although the production of our textile industry only reaches 10 percent of what the Brazilian people need, even this 10 percent of the products have to be exported and cannot be sold in the domestic market, because the vast number of farmers do not have the purchasing power, and farmers in some areas only have a small piece of cloth to cover their bodies.

    The lives of workers are as hard as the lives of farmers. The average monthly wage of an ordinary worker is 600 Brazilian currency (equivalent to 20 US dollars), but housing takes up half of it - 300 currency. A pound of meat costs 30 currency, which means that a worker's monthly wage can only buy 20 pounds of meat; a chicken costs 60 currency, not a fat chicken, but a skinny chicken, which means that three days' wages can buy a chicken. Brazil is the number one coffee-producing country in the world, but the Brazilian people cannot drink coffee, because the worst coffee costs 40 currency a pound. The workers' main food is white beans, and they are forced to live in simple small houses on the mountains outside the city, without water or electricity, and they cannot enjoy even the most basic living conditions.

    The Brazilian people are very poor, and the lives of the petty bourgeoisie are getting worse every day. Due to the commercial competition of American imperialism, Brazilian national capitalists have also declared bankruptcy one after another.

    It is obvious that the Brazilian people living in such poor conditions, the oppressed Brazilian people, the hungry Brazilian people will never take up arms to fight for American imperialism, which gives the development of the Brazilian peace movement great possibilities.

    In April 1949, the Brazilian people held the First Brazilian Peace Conference. The Brazilian reactionary government sent police to surround the venue and fired at the masses attending the conference, killing and wounding many people, and the police arrested several hundred people. American imperialism wanted to eliminate the Brazilian peace movement at the time of its birth, but they suffered a shameful defeat. The police were ordered to prohibit activities to defend peace, but the peace movement went underground and continued to carry out activities.

    After American imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, it forced the Brazilian reactionary government to send troops to Korea as accomplices, but due to the enthusiastic development of the nationwide movement against sending troops to Korea, the peace movement also achieved legal status. At that time, in Brazil, the Stockholm Peace Signature Movement cooperated with the movement against sending troops to Korea. Under the barbaric terror of the police, 5 million people still signed their names. In the signature movement, more than 100 people were arrested, tortured, and sentenced to prison. Thirty-four people, including two women, were shot and killed by the police while collecting Stockholm signatures.

    In October 1950, the Brazilian people victoriously held the Second Brazilian Peace Conference. Since then, the peace movement has continued to strengthen. In Brazil, the struggle to defend peace is inseparable from the struggle to strive for national independence and liberation. Patriots with various different political beliefs demand the establishment of a free and independent homeland. They all clearly realize that if a new war breaks out, Brazil will be completely turned into a colony of American imperialism. Therefore, they have a clearer understanding that to strive for freedom and independence, they must fight for peace. This situation has enabled the Brazilian people to achieve several major victories in the movement to defend peace. For example, the Brazilian people's victory against sending troops to Korea. American imperialism demanded that the Brazilian government send 5,000 soldiers to Korea to fight, and the Brazilian reactionary government agreed. However, the Brazilian people firmly opposed it, and the government had to stop this evil action. Due to the heroic struggle of the Brazilian people, not a single Brazilian soldier was sent to Korea to fight for American imperialism. I believe that they will not go in the future either.

    In 1951, there were two important events in the history of the Brazilian peace movement:

    (1) In July 1951, the Brazilian Writers' Conference was convened, and the Brazilian writers who participated in the conference issued a declaration saying that their primary task was to defend peace and strive for Brazil's complete independence.

    (2) The Third Brazilian Peace Conference was convened, and people from all walks of life and various sectors of society enthusiastically and passionately participated in the conference. When the conference announced that the Latin American Peace Conference would be held in Rio de Janeiro, 20,000 people registered with the conference that day, volunteering to participate in the preparatory work.

    The Brazilian movement to defend peace, like other Brazilian people's movements to strive for progress and democracy, such as the National Democratic Liberation Movement, the Movement to Defend Brazilian Wealth, and the Movement to Defend Democratic Freedom, all have the Brazilian Communist Party as the core of leadership.

    The Brazilian Communist Party will celebrate its 30th anniversary in April this year. It is the largest party among the Communist Parties of the Americas, with more than 200,000 members. From its establishment until 1945, the Brazilian Communist Party operated underground. From 1945 to 1947, it first obtained legal status. After obtaining legal status, the Brazilian Communist Party participated in the 1945 general election, and among the 6 million voters, it won 800,000 votes. We know that in Brazil, illiterates do not have the right to vote, which means that most of the workers do not have the right to vote. In all the large industrial cities, the Communist Party won the most votes. In May 1947, the Brazilian government, upon the instructions of its American master, declared the Communist Party an illegal organization. Also declared illegal were the Brazilian General Confederation of Labor, the Brazilian Communist Youth League, and many other progressive democratic groups. The qualifications of the Brazilian Communist Party deputies in the Congress were revoked. What followed was the arrest and illegal interrogation of Brazilian Communist Party leaders, such as Party General Secretary Comrade Prestes. The government has ordered his arrest, and his case is still ongoing. More than 100 party members have been arrested this time, and more than 60 have been sentenced to long prison terms. I recently received a message that in my country, two comrades were shot and killed by the police. Prison, torture, and shooting are the weapons of imperialism against the Brazilian Communist Party and Brazilian patriots, but these weapons cannot at all frustrate the fighting will of the Brazilian Communists.

    Comrade Prestes is the most respected and prestigious leader of the Latin American people. His name symbolizes the struggle against imperialism. He has dedicated his life to the struggle for national liberation. In 1924, he led the Brazilian people's armed revolution. During the three years, his soldiers carried out fierce struggles against the reactionary government. From south to north, from east to west, their footprints spread all over Brazil. This is what the Brazilian people later called the Prestes Long March. Comrade Prestes later went to the Soviet Union, where he lived for four years. After that, he returned to Brazil to lead the people to participate in the anti-fascist and national liberation movement. In 1935, he led an armed revolution against fascism and imperialism. After the failure of the armed revolution, he was sentenced to 49 years of long-term imprisonment. From 1935 to 1945, during the ten years, he was in prison and completely cut off from the outside world. In 1945, due to the great victories of the Soviet Red Army in the war against fascism in Europe and Asia, and due to the development of the Brazilian people's movement, he was finally released. After his release, he was elected as a member of the Brazilian Senate with the most votes. He constantly exposed the American imperialist aggression conspiracies and war preparation policies in Latin America, and condemned the shameless behavior of the American imperialist running dogs who sold out the interests of the people of their homeland.

    In January 1948, his qualifications as a senator were revoked for no reason, and he went underground to lead the Brazilian people in a more determined struggle.

    In August 1950, the Brazilian Communist Party issued a declaration calling on the Brazilian people to unite and fight to the end to defend peace and strive for the independence and liberation of the homeland. The declaration called on the Brazilian people to strive for the path to a new democratic country and join the world peace camp. This declaration had a great impact, and the Brazilian people, under the leadership of Comrade Prestes and the Brazilian Communist Party, launched a heroic struggle against American imperialism, striving for peace and striving for liberation.

    Comrade Prestes said in a recent article: "The Brazilian people will never fight against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the new democratic countries. If the Brazilian people are forced to take up arms, it will be against our enemies - American imperialism and its running dogs who oppress and exploit us."

    The Brazilian people will always remember this famous saying, and the Brazilian people will constantly recite this famous saying.

    拉丁美洲的和平运动
    ——一九五二年二月七日在中国人民外交学会欢迎会上的报告
    巴西作家“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人  乔治·亚马多
    拉丁美洲是一个拥有广大面积的大陆，大陆上有二十个共和国，这些共和国以前都是西班牙、葡萄牙或者是法国的殖民地。这些国家虽然距离中国很远，但是拉丁美洲各国人民是关怀中国人民的。拉丁美洲人民正进行着反对帝国主义，尤其是反对美国帝国主义的斗争，也就是为和平、为他们祖国的解放而斗争。
    拉丁美洲这些共和国在十九世纪期间正式摆脱了殖民地的统治。一八○四年，海地共和国第一个脱离了外国的统治；一九○二年，古巴共和国最后一个获得独立。在这一百年的期间，其他共和国相继挣脱了殖民地统治的桎梏。拉丁美洲各国的独立，是以无数人民的鲜血和牺牲的代价换取得来的。起初，拉丁美洲的人民怀着很大的希望，以为他们祖国的独立将是繁荣、真正民主、进步和自由时代的开始，但是这个希望一会儿就消灭了。拉丁美洲人民只不过看到新的统治阶级代替了西班牙或葡萄牙旧的殖民地统治者。大地主阶级背叛了人民和祖国，法律不是由人民制订的，而是由美英帝国主义的代表和走狗所一手制订的。实际上，拉丁美洲这二十个共和国从来没有获得真正的独立自主，它们只是附属国或是半殖民地国家，任伦敦“城”和华尔街的老板随意地剥削。
    拉丁美洲各国一百多年来的历史，就是一部对人民压迫、抢劫、恐怖、剥削的历史。一般说来，那些夺得政权的政府，都是血腥的独裁政权，只为他们的帝国主义主子服务。帝国主义可以随意更换各国的独裁者；帝国主义认为最好的政府就是那些最能压迫人民、不讲国家利益、把他们祖国的财产出卖得最贱的政府。这些反动政府只是为帝国主义服务的傀儡，他们的双手都沾满了人民的鲜血。
    同志们，你们是知道这种样式的政府的；在拉丁美洲，在我们的国家里，我们有一系列的小蒋介石，他们叫做瓦尔加斯（巴西总统）或是庇隆（阿根廷总统）；叫做魏地拉（智利总统）或是特卢吉罗（多米尼加总统）。他们统治着较大的国家，例如巴西或阿根廷；较小的国家，例如巴拿马或尼加拉瓜。他们有一个共同点：就是对人民有很深的仇恨，对帝国主义就绝对地服从。
    在这样广大的拉丁美洲大陆上，藏着无数的财富。这些财富足够居住在大陆上的人民过着幸福的生活；但是，这些财富却并不属于我们人民，而全部被帝国主义掠夺和侵占了。今天，这些财富被利用来准备对苏联、新中国和人民民主国家的侵略战争。
    假使我们翻开拉丁美洲的地图来看，我们就可以看出拉丁美洲在地理上的重要性。美帝国主义从来就把拉丁美洲当做它的势力范围，把拉丁美洲当做它最可靠的仓库。一九四七年美帝国主义和拉丁美洲签订了“里约热内卢公约”，这就是大西洋公约的先声。“里约热内卢公约”规定所有拉丁美洲国家必须支持美帝国主义的冒险战争政策。要知道美帝国主义利用这个公约的控制拉丁美洲各国的情形，只要看联合国大会投票表决的情形就可以明白了：拉丁美洲二十个国家机械地投票赞成美国所有的提案，投票反对所有与美帝国主义愿望相抵触的提案。
    但是，拉丁美洲各国政府的行动并不能说明各国人民都赞同美国的备战政策；正相反，拉丁美洲各国的人民和这二十个国家的政府是有很大的区别的，它们是完全不能相容的。拉丁美洲的人民是要求和平、要求美好的生活、要求国家的独立、要求驱逐帝国主义者的。拉丁美洲人民是爱好苏联、爱好新中国、爱好朝鲜和人民民主国家的。在拉丁美洲，战争宣传非常嚣张，所有属于美帝国主义的报纸、广播电台、电影、剧院等都在宣传战争。它们每天都在造谣，诽谤苏联，诽谤新中国和人民民主国家。在拉丁美洲大部分的国家里，进步的报纸是被禁止出版的。就是在那些有着进步报纸出版的国家，例如在巴西和古巴，它们也都遭受到野蛮的迫害。举例来说，里约热内卢“群众日报”的社长最近就被反动政府判处了两年徒刑。虽然如此，帝国主义的新战争宣传依然不能欺骗拉丁美洲的人民。在拉丁美洲，真理的力量如同太阳一般地照耀着。拉丁美洲人民的眼睛是雪亮的，他们能辨别是非。他们看到祖国的财富不再属于他们而是落在美国人的手中；他们看到侵占和开发他们的矿山和油田的并不是苏联人、中国人或是朝鲜人，而是美国人；他们看到支持大地主、阻碍土地改革进行的并不是苏联人、中国人，而是美国人；他们看到在他们国家里建设军事基地、海军基地、空军基地的并不是苏联人或中国人，而是美国人；他们看到在他们国家中，造成绝大部分文盲的责任并不属于苏联人或中国人，而是美国人；他们看到了干涉他们国家内政、支持血腥的独裁统治的并不是苏联人或中国人，而是美国人；他们看到了以征服者出现、飘扬在他们国土上空的并不是苏联的红旗或中国的五星红旗，而是美国星条旗。在这些事实面前，一切战争宣传不攻自破了。在这些事实面前，怎能叫人民相信美帝国主义的宣传呢？
    这一切说明了和平运动在拉丁美洲一天比一天扩大；这一切说明了拉丁美洲人民对美帝国主义的仇恨一天比一天增涨；这一切也说明了拉丁美洲国家独立解放运动一天比一天加强。
    新的战争危机，很明显地，加重了美帝国主义对我们拉丁美洲国家的压迫。巴拉圭共产党最近发表一个文件，分析目前的形势。文件这样说：新战争的危机将使拉丁美洲国家由仆从国的地位沦为美国真正的殖民地。拉丁美洲国家已逐渐丧失了独立，美帝国主义在政治上、经济上、文化上统治着我们的国家。
    我们的矿山是由美国资产阶级和我们国家的统治阶级合营开发的。在拉丁美洲各国政府的各部、会中，都有混合委员会的组织，实际上，一切都由美国人操纵。在政府各部、会里，我们的部长只不过是美帝国主义的听差。我们的工厂由于美国的侵略和竞争，纷纷倒闭了。在文化事业方面也是一样，教育部长对美帝国主义唯命是听。学校里进行着奴化教育，传播着美国生活方式。举一个典型的例子：在拉丁美洲某些国家中，我们的人民有黑人血统，但并没有种族歧视，现在美国把他们种族歧视的“文明”输入到我们的国家来了。
    但是，拉丁美洲人民唾弃这种野蛮的美国式的文明。在每一个拉丁美洲的国家里，广泛地产生了反对帝国主义的思想。以工人阶级为首的拉丁美洲人民投入了伟大的保卫世界和平的斗争。拉丁美洲各国共产党的影响一天比一天扩大。在拉丁美洲某些国家里，如在巴西、阿根庭、智利、古巴、委内瑞拉和墨西哥，争取民族独立解放的运动正在发展。
    我们可以说，拉丁美洲国家的和平运动，自从一九四九年在墨西哥举行了拉丁美洲和平大会后，便在顺利地发展着。应该特别说明的是：一九四九年拉丁美洲第一届和平大会是在美帝国主义认为是它最可靠的营地——墨西哥举行的。当时美国国务院使用了很大的压力，禁止大会的召开，但是，这种阴谋终于失败了。那时候，和平运动在拉丁美洲还只限于狭小的范围内，参加大会的只是各国共产党和较进步的人士。可是，假使我们想一想：拉丁美洲人民从来没有直接遭受战争的影响，和平大会仍然可以召开，我们就可以知道大会的重要意义了。
    当时有不少人认为：假使发生第三次世界大战，拉丁美洲国家就可以争取完全的独立。这种思想使和平运动的推动和发展遇到了困难。一九五○年六月二十五日美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的战争根本改变了这种形势。怀着幻想的一部分拉丁美洲人民惊醒了。拉丁美洲人民清楚地认识了：
    （一）战争并不像他们以前所想的离开拉丁美洲那么远。因为美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争后，就强迫拉丁美洲国家派军队到朝鲜去作战。
    （二）拉丁美洲人民也明白了美帝国主义把争取国家独立和民族解放的运动认做是侵略。朝鲜战争就是一个很好的证明。
    由于各阶层人民的觉悟，拉丁美洲各国的和平运动就蓬勃地展开了。过去不参加和平运动的人，现在都踊跃地投入了这个伟大的运动。拉丁美洲各国各党派、宗教界、文化界人士，以及普通一般市民，都反对参加朝鲜战争。为了要加强和深入和平运动，目前拉丁美洲正准备举行第二届和平大会。这个大会由许多拉丁美洲知名之士发起，今年三月间将在巴西的京城里约热内卢举行。巴西政府已下令禁止这个大会的召开，但是，我相信拉丁美洲的广大人民会这样说：“第二届和平大会是一定要召开的。”
    和平运动在拉丁美洲各国的发展并不平衡。在和平力量较强的国家里，例如巴西、智利、古巴、阿根廷、危地马拉、墨西哥和乌拉圭，和平运动取得了合法的地位。在和平力量较弱的国家里，例如由法西斯政权统治的南美那些小的共和国，巴拉圭和玻利维亚，和平运动是非法的，被禁止的。
    但是，不管怎样，有一件事是可以肯定的。虽然美帝国主义战争贩子们以强暴的压力要求拉丁美洲各国派军队到朝鲜替他们作战，一直到现在只有哥伦比亚一个国家遣派了一千个兵去做炮灰，其他的拉丁美洲国家，由于广大人民的反对，阻止了他们政府遣派军队到朝鲜去。就是哥伦比亚，自从第一批（一千人）离开后，美帝国主义虽然要求派更多人，但由于人民的抗议，政府也无法再派军队去了。
    允许我向诸位谈一谈巴西和平运动的情况：
    巴西是拉丁美洲大陆上最大的共和国，在世界上，除了苏联和中国之外，巴西的国土要算最大的了。巴西面积将近九百万方公里，人口有五千五百万。巴西有无数的财富，巴西有各种非常丰富的矿产，巴西有肥沃的土地，但是巴西人民却在封建大地主阶级和美帝国主义的压迫和剥削下过着非常贫困的生活。我们可以说巴西的天然财富几乎完全属于帝国主义者，国内的工业完全落在外国帝国主义的手中，电气工业、矿山、交通事业、肉类食品工业、对外贸易，例如咖啡和可可，完全落在美帝国主义的魔掌中。辽阔广大的土地属于一小撮大地主。三分之二的巴西人口住在农村，但他们却没有土地。他们租大地主的土地耕种。巴西农民过着不堪想像的非人的生活。巴西的农村很落后，由于人力很贱，根本没有机器来耕种。在某些地方，农民从来没有看见过钱币，因为他们劳苦一辈子，只换得吃不饱、饿不死的一点粮食。至于农村卫生更不必谈，传染病，例如肺病、麻疯、天花、霍乱都很流行，婴孩死亡率是世界最高的。在农村里，文盲占农村人口的百分之八十二。没有任何法律保障贫农和雇农。
    在巴西，我们有三百万产业工人，这三百万工人都集中在南部的几个大城市里。虽然巴西是出产原料的国家，可是，巴西并没有重工业，所有的原料都输出给美国。我们的工业最重要的是纺织工业，但使用的却是陈旧不堪的机器。虽然我们纺织工业的生产只达到巴西人民所需要的百分之十，可是，就这百分之十的产品也得出口，不能在国内市场销售，因为广大的农民没有购买力，某些区域的农民只有一小块布遮身。
    工人的生活和农民的生活一样苦。一个普通工人平均每月的工资是巴西币六百元（合二十美元），但是住房就要占去一半——三百元，一斤肉值三十元，那就是说一个工人每月的工资只能买二十斤肉；一只鸡值六十元，不是肥鸡，而是瘦鸡，那就是说三天的工资才能买一只鸡。巴西是世界上第一位产咖啡的国家，但是巴西人民喝不上咖啡，因为最次的咖啡要四十元一斤。工人的粮食主要是白豆，他们被迫住在城外山上的简陋的小房子里，没有水电，最基本的生活条件也享受不到。
    巴西人民是很贫穷的，小资产阶级的生活也一天不如一天。由于美帝国主义的商业竞争，巴西民族资本家也纷纷宣告破产。
    很明显的，在这样穷苦情况下生活的巴西人民，受压迫的巴西人民，饥饿的巴西人民是决不会拿起武器来替美帝国主义作战的，这给予巴西和平运动的发展以很大的可能性。
    一九四九年四月间，巴西人民举行了第一届巴西和平大会。巴西反动政府曾派警察包围会场，向参加大会的群众射击，打死和打伤了很多人，警察并逮捕了好几百人。美帝国主义想在巴西和平运动诞生的时候就消灭它，可是他们遭受了可耻的失败。警察奉命禁止保卫和平的活动，但是和平运动转入地下，继续展开活动。
    美帝国主义发动侵略朝鲜战争后，曾强迫巴西反动政府派军队到朝鲜去作帮凶，但是由于全国性的反对出兵朝鲜的运动热烈地展开，和平运动也取得了合法的地位。当时在巴西，斯德哥尔摩和平签名运动与反对出兵朝鲜运动相配合，在警察野蛮恐怖的迫害下，仍然有五百万人签了名。在签名运动中，有一百多人被逮捕、遭受酷刑和被判徒刑。有三十四个人，其中有两个妇女，在收集斯德哥尔摩签名时候，给警察开枪打死了。
    一九五○年十月，巴西人民胜利地举行了第二届巴西和平大会。从此以后，和平运动不断增强。在巴西，保卫和平的斗争是与争取祖国独立解放的斗争分不开的。有着各种不同的政治信仰的爱国者都要求建立一个自由独立的祖国。他们都清楚认识到：假使发生新战争，巴西将要完全变成美帝国主义的殖民地。因此，他们就更清楚地认识到：要争取自由和独立，就要为和平而斗争。这种形势使得巴西人民在保卫和平运动中，获得了几次重大的胜利。例如巴西人民反对出兵朝鲜的胜利。美帝国主义要求巴西政府派五千名士兵到朝鲜去打仗，巴西反动政府也答应了。但是，巴西人民坚决反对，政府不得不停止这种罪恶的行动。由于巴西人民的英勇斗争，没有一个巴西的士兵被派到朝鲜替美帝国主义作战。我相信以后也不会去的。
    一九五一年在巴西和平运动史上有两件重要的事件：
    （一）一九五一年七月召开了巴西作家大会，参加大会的巴西作家发表宣言说：他们的首要任务是保卫和平与争取巴西的完全独立。
    （二）召开了第三届巴西和平大会，各阶层和社会各界人士都踊跃地、充满了热忱地参加了大会。当大会宣布拉丁美洲和平大会将在里约热内卢举行的时候，当天就有两万人向大会登记，志愿要求参加筹备工作。
    巴西保卫和平运动如同其他巴西人民争取进步和民主的运动一样，例如全国民主解放运动、保卫巴西财富运动、保卫民主自由运动，都以巴西共产党为领导核心。
    巴西共产党在今年四月间将庆祝它成立的第三十周年纪念。它是美洲各国共产党里面最大的党，有二十多万党员。从成立开始一直到一九四五年，巴西共产党都是在地下活动。一九四五年到一九四七年间，才第一次取得了合法的地位。巴西共产党在取得了合法地位后就参加了一九四五年的普选，在六百万选民当中，获得了八十万张选票。我们知道，在巴西，文盲是无选举权的，那就是说大部分的工人是没有选举权的。在所有的大工业城市中，共产党获得最多的选票。巴西政府于一九四七年五月接受它美国主子的指示，宣布共产党为非法组织。同时被宣布为非法组织的还有巴西总工会、巴西共产主义青年团和许多其他进步的民主团体。在国会中取消了巴西共产党议员的资格。接着而来的就是逮捕和非法审讯巴西共产党领袖，如党总书记普列斯蒂斯同志，政府已下令通缉他，他的案子目前还在继续进行中。这次被捕的党员有一百多人，已经有六十多人被判处长期徒刑。我最近接到一个消息，在我的国家里，有两位同志被警察枪杀了。牢狱、酷刑、枪杀是帝国主义对付巴西共产党和巴西爱国者的武器，但是，这些武器一点都不能挫折巴西共产党员的斗争意志。
    普列斯蒂斯同志是拉丁美洲人民所最敬爱、最有威望的领袖。他的名字象征着反对帝国主义的斗争。他把一生都献身于国家解放的斗争。一九二四年他曾领导巴西人民武装革命，在三年期间，他的战士们向反动政府进行了剧烈的斗争，他们从南到北，从东到西，足迹走遍全巴西，这是后来巴西人民所说的普列斯蒂斯长征。普列斯蒂斯同志后来到苏联去，他在那里居住了四年之后，又回到巴西来，领导人民参加反法西斯主义和全国解放运动。一九三五年他领导武装革命，反对法西斯主义和帝国主义。武装革命失败后，他被判处四十九年长期徒刑，从一九三五年到一九四五年十年期间，他在狱中，与外界完全断绝。一九四五年由于苏联红军在反对法西斯的战争中在欧洲和亚洲取得了伟大的胜利，由于巴西人民运动的发展，他终于被释放了。释放后，他以最多票数被选为巴西上议院议员，他不断地揭发美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的侵略阴谋和备战政策，谴责美帝国主义的走狗们出卖祖国人民利益的无耻行为。
    一九四八年一月，他的上议员资格毫无理由地被取消，他转入地下活动，不屈不挠地领导巴西人民进行更坚决的斗争。
    一九五○年八月巴西共产党发表宣言，号召巴西人民团结起来，为保卫和平和争取祖国的独立解放而斗争到底。宣言号召巴西人民争取走向新民主主义国家的道路，加入世界和平阵营。这宣言起了很大的影响，巴西人民在普列斯蒂斯同志和巴西共产党的领导下，展开了反对美帝国主义、争取和平、争取解放的英勇斗争。
    普列斯蒂斯同志在最近写的一篇文章里这样说：“巴西人民绝对不会对苏联、中华人民共和国和新民主主义国家作战的，假使巴西人民被迫拿起武器，就是对我们的敌人——压迫我们、剥削我们的美帝国主义和它的走狗作战。”
    巴西人民会永远记住这句名言，巴西人民会不断地念诵这句名言。
