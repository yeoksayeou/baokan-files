    Jin Hua Textile Factory Discovers Serious Waste of Accumulated Funds During Asset Clearance
    Editor: During the asset clearance and capital verification work, employees of the Shanxi Jinhua Textile Factory discovered extremely serious instances of fund accumulation and waste. The factory's monthly circulating capital is approximately 1.6 billion yuan, while the total value of inventory materials reaches over 17 billion yuan, enough for ten months of use. The small warehouse in the carpet weaving workshop has eight rolls of doffer clothing, each roll lasting five to six years, enough for the entire factory for twenty years. Over the past year, waste in areas such as basic construction, accidents (major and minor), and the use of raw materials is estimated to be as high as 3.3 billion yuan. After this inspection, employees have realized that these serious phenomena of fund accumulation and waste are the biggest obstacles to implementing the economic accounting system. Therefore, in addition to automatically launching a material donation movement, they have also established a reasonable tool usage system. Workers have now established eleven types of tool usage systems, which are estimated to save the state more than 12,000 catties of millet per year.

    晋华纺织厂在清理资产中
    发现严重积压资金浪费现象
    编辑同志：山西晋华纺织厂职工在清理资产核定资金工作中，发现积压资金和浪费情况十分严重。全厂每月周转的资金约十六亿元；而库存物资总值就达一百七十多亿元，够十个月用。织毯间小仓库有八盘道夫针布，每盘能用五、六年，够全厂用二十年。一年来，这个厂在基本建设、大小事故、原材料的使用等方面的浪费，据估计有三十三亿元之多。经过这次检查，职工们都认识到这些严重的积压资金浪费现象是实行经济核算制的最大障碍，因而除了自动地展开缴献物资运动外，并订出了合理的工具使用制度。现在工人们已经订立了十一种工具的使用制度，总计一年可给国家节省小米一万二千多斤。
