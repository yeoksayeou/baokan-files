    In the anti-corruption and anti-waste campaign,
    the Northeast Cooperative Goods Station continues to cause huge losses to the country
    Comrade Editor: Leading cadres of the Northeast District Cooperative Goods Station have serious bureaucratic work styles. They do not pay attention to the proper storage of goods transported from various places. During the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, they continue to cause serious losses to the people's property. After the goods station received more than 4,400 bundles of sugar cane sent by the Nanchang Special District Cooperative in Jiangxi Province, they were placed in the courtyard. The comrade escorting the goods from Nanchang saw this and urged Manager Lü of the goods station to find a way to store them to prevent the sugar cane from freezing, but Manager Lü used the excuse of carrying out the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign to ignore this suggestion. Later, the sugar cane was frozen before being stored in a small house. Because the sugar cane thawed after heating up, it became soft and moldy. As a result, this batch of sugar cane had to be sold at a reduced price from 18,000 yuan per bundle to 8,000 yuan per bundle, resulting in a loss of approximately 50 million yuan. Two hundred and seventy thousand catties of Oucheng oranges shipped from the Zhejiang Provincial Cooperative were also sold at reduced prices due to freezing, resulting in a loss of 520 million yuan. The losses caused by the poor storage of chestnuts sent to the goods station by the Tangshan Special District Cooperative, oranges sent by the Hunan Provincial Cooperative, and ginger sent by the Shandong Provincial Cooperative are no less than 370 million yuan. Since the beginning of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign, the total losses caused by bureaucracy at the goods station are approximately 940 million yuan. I believe that the Northeast Cooperative Headquarters should thoroughly investigate these matters.  Zhu Hua
    Editor's Note: The leading authorities of the Northeast District Cooperative Goods Station should promptly investigate and handle this matter and publish it in the newspaper. All agencies should learn a lesson from this, and under no circumstances should they allow state property to continue to suffer losses during the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign.

    在反贪污、反浪费运动中
    东北合作货栈竟继续给国家造成巨大损失
    编辑同志：东北区合作货栈领导干部有严重的官僚主义作风，他们不注意保管各地运来的货物，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，使人民财产继续受到严重的损失。该货栈收到江西省南昌专区社发来的甘蔗四千四百多捆后，就放在院内。南昌押运的同志看见了，催促该货栈的吕经理设法安置，以免把甘蔗冻坏，但吕经理却以进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动为辞，不理睬这一建议。以后甘蔗受冻，才存到小屋里。甘蔗因返热化冻，就变软霉烂了。因此，这批甘蔗只好由一万八千元一捆降到八千元一捆出售，损失了五千万元左右。由浙江省社运来的二十七万斤瓯柑，也因受冻而降价出售，损失了五亿二千多万元。唐山专区社发给该货栈的栗子，湖南省社发到该货栈的橘子，山东省社发来的生姜等物，因该货栈保管不善而造成的损失，也不下三亿七千万元。自反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，该货栈因官僚主义所造成的损失总共约九亿四千万元。我认为东北合作总社应该彻底检查这些事情。  朱华
    编者按：东北区合作货栈的领导机关，应迅速检查处理这一事件，并在报上公布。一切机关都应由此获得教训，在反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，绝对不能允许使国家财产继续遭受损失。
