The promotion of Ma Liuhaizi's advanced experience in the North China mines was not very smooth before the North China State-Owned Coal Mine Rapid Tunneling Workers' Representative Meeting. Yan Jinshou, the union group leader of the No. 206 advanced tunneling team of the Jingxing Coal Mine, described the attitude of the tunneling workers in their mine towards Ma Liuhaizi's advanced experience in this representative meeting: "Last June, Ma Liuhaizi's team's advanced experience was introduced to our Jingxing Mine. The mine also convened a staff and worker meeting to mobilize the promotion of this advanced experience. But at that time, when we heard that Ma Liuhaizi's tunneling team only tunneled 300 meters a month in the Datong Coal Mine, where there was no gas underground and the tunnels did not need support, we didn't think much of their experience. When union cadres mobilized us to try multi-heading cyclic operations, we emphasized that the roof of the Jingxing Mine was not as good as Datong's and the coal seams were more variable than Datong's. Seeing that we lacked confidence, the union cadres also lost their enthusiasm." When Yan Jinshou set off for Datong Mine to attend this meeting, the news that Ma Liuhaizi and other tunneling teams had launched a "Ma Liuhaizi Tunneling Team" labor emulation had just spread to the Jingxing Mine. The workers of the No. 206 team repeatedly told Yan Jinshou to take a good look at the working conditions of the Ma Liuhaizi team, to see how many people were in their team and what tools they were using, so that they could formulate their own conditions for the challenge after returning to Jingxing and compete with the Ma Liuhaizi Tunneling Team. In the past, the tunneling workers of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine always unilaterally believed that their tunnel specifications were different from Datong's, and there were no conditions for implementing cyclic operations. In the past, the tunneling workers of the Yangquan Coal Mine also always emphasized that the roof of their mine was not good and the gas content was high, so they could not compare with Datong. The reason why the tunneling workers in each mine had such views was mainly that they did not have a sufficient understanding of the superiority of Ma Liuhaizi's tunneling team's advanced experience.
    In order to sweep away the ideological obstacles to promoting Ma Liuhaizi's team's advanced experience, the leadership of the North China State-Owned Coal Mine Rapid Tunneling Workers' Representative Meeting, after having Ma Liuhaizi and Zhao You make brief introductions of their experiences on the first day of the meeting, organized the delegates to go down the mine for on-site visits for two full days. During the visit, the delegates saw that after the workers of Ma Liuhaizi and Zhao You's two tunneling teams quickly completed the shift handover at the work face, the tunneling workers immediately drilled holes in a vacant area left by the outgoing shift, and the haulage workers loaded coal in the tunnels where coal had been left. When the tunneling workers finished blasting, the haulage workers had already cleared another tunnel, so they quickly exchanged work faces with each other without even having to call to each other, with very little production downtime. After the visit, the delegates had a deep understanding of the superiority of multi-heading cyclic operations. The delegates were particularly surprised by the skilled drilling and blasting techniques of the workers in the Ma Liuhaizi tunneling team. Because the drilling holes had fixed positions and angles, they drilled as soon as they picked up the electric drill, without any need to think, and it took them only ten to twenty minutes at most to drill a set of holes. After the visit, Yan Jinshou expressed his feelings at the group meeting, saying: After seeing the tight and scientific working methods of others, I realized how backward we are. With our single-heading tunneling method, after blasting, we have to load the coal out before we can continue tunneling, so either the tunneling workers, haulage workers, and support workers all pitch in to load the cars, making it impossible for everyone to move around on the work face, or the tunneling workers are idle on the sidelines, not knowing how much manpower and work time is wasted!
    Because of the deep understanding of the superiority of Ma Liuhaizi's tunneling team's advanced experience during the visit, the delegates not only stopped emphasizing the difficulties in promoting this advanced experience, but also actively tried to find ways to overcome those difficulties. In the past, some people believed that multi-heading cyclic operations could only be implemented in coal mines with consistent tunnel specifications. At this meeting, after repeated discussions and studies, these people realized that as long as the staff and workers were mobilized to find solutions and the workload and working time were calculated accurately, multi-heading cyclic operations could also be implemented in coal mines with different tunnel specifications. Some delegates used to worry that after the implementation of multi-heading cyclic operations increased tunneling efficiency, the support work would not keep up and there would be danger. At this meeting, after hearing the representatives of the Jingxing Mine introduce their method of pre-fabricating supports according to specifications and then transporting them to the mine, these delegates' concerns were also dispelled. In the past, many coal mines in North China used British-made electric drills for rapid tunneling work. At present, the drill bits for this type of electric drill are very expensive and difficult to buy. The representative of the Jingxi Coal Mine introduced their method of self-making alloy steel electric drill bits at this meeting, providing a solution to this difficulty for various mines.
    The North China State-Owned Coal Mine Rapid Tunneling Workers' Representative Meeting swept away the ideological obstacles to the promotion of Ma Liuhaizi's tunneling team's advanced experience. Therefore, at the end of the meeting, the representatives of each mine expressed that they would lead the tunneling workers of the entire mine to fully promote the "Ma Liuhaizi Multi-Heading Cyclic Tunneling Method" after returning to their mines. When the delegates left the Datong Coal Mine, they earnestly said to Ma Liuhaizi: "You are the banner of the tunneling workers in our North China coal mines. If you have any new innovations in your work in the future, be sure to write us a letter and tell us, so that we can work together to improve the tunneling efficiency of coal mines!"

    华北国营煤矿快速掘进工人代表会议  
    扫除了推广马六孩先进经验的思想障碍
    在华北国营煤矿快速掘进工人代表会议以前，马六孩掘进组的先进经验在华北各矿的推广是不很顺利的。井陉煤矿第二○六先进掘进组的工会组长阎进寿在这次代表会议上叙述他们矿上掘进工人过去对待马六孩先进经验的情形说：“去年六月份，马六孩组的先进经验就被介绍到我们井陉矿，矿上也曾经召开了职工大会，动员推广这一先进经验。可是那时候，一听说马六孩掘进组在大同煤矿那样井下既没有沼气、巷道又不需要支棚的良好条件下，一个月才掘进了三百来公尺，我们对他们的经验就瞧不到眼里。工会干部动员我们试行多孔道循环作业时，我们就强调井陉矿的顶板不如大同好，煤层变化比大同多。工会干部看见我们信心不高，也就泄了劲。”阎进寿这次动身来大同矿开会的时候，马六孩等掘进组发起“马六孩掘进队”劳动竞赛的消息刚传到井陉矿，二○六组的工友们都再三嘱咐阎进寿要把马六孩组的工作条件好好地看一看，看看他们组里到底有几个人？使唤的啥工具？回井陉后好制定自己的应战条件，和马六孩掘进队比个高低。焦作煤矿的掘进工人过去总是片面地认为他们的巷道规格和大同的不同，实行循环作业没有条件。阳泉煤矿的掘进工人过去也老是强调他们矿井的顶板不好、瓦斯量大，怎么也不能和大同比。各矿掘进工人所以有这样的看法，主要是他们对马六孩掘进组先进经验的优越性认识不足。
    为了扫除推广马六孩组先进经验的思想障碍，华北国营煤矿快速掘进工人代表会议的领导方面，在会议的头一天让马六孩和赵有做了扼要的经验介绍以后，就用整整两天的时间组织到会代表下井实地参观。在参观时，代表们看到马六孩和赵有两个掘进组的工人在工作面上迅速办完了交接班手续后，掘进工人马上就在上班工人留下的一个空基中打眼，搬运工人就在那个留有存煤的巷道中装煤。当掘进工人放完炮时，搬运工人已将另一巷道清理出来，所以他们甚至不用招呼，就迅速地相互调换了工作面进行工作，很少有生产间隙。参观后，代表们对多孔道循环作业的优越性才都有了深刻的体会。代表们特别惊讶马六孩掘进组的工人们打眼放炮技术的熟练。因为打眼都有固定的位置和角度，所以他们抱起电钻后就打，丝毫也不用思索，打一遍眼顶多只用一二十分钟的时间。阎进寿参观后，在小组会上发表他的感想说：看了人家那种严密的科学的工作方法，才了解自己的落后。我们用单孔道掘进的办法，在放完炮后，必须把煤装出去才能继续掘进，因此不是掘进工人、搬运工人、支柱工人一齐插手装车，弄到大家在工作面上转不开身，就是掘进工人在一旁闲起来，不知浪费了多少人力和工时！
    由于在参观中深切体会了马六孩掘进组先进经验的优越性，代表们不但不再强调推广这一先进经验的困难，而且都积极地想办法来克服那些困难。过去有些人认为多孔道循环作业只有在巷道规格一致的煤矿才能实行。在这次会议上，经过大家反复讨论、研究，这些人已认识到只要发动职工想办法，精密地计算工作量和工作时间，在巷道规格不一样的煤矿也可以实行多孔道循环作业。有些代表过去怕实行多孔道循环作业使掘进效率提高后，支棚工作赶不上，会出危险。在这次会上，听到井陉矿的代表介绍了他们事先按规格做好支棚、然后运到井下的方法，这些代表们的顾虑也解除了。过去华北不少煤矿在快速掘进工作上都是使用英国制造的电钻，目前这种电钻的钎头价钱很贵，并且不好买。京西煤矿的代表在这次会上介绍了他们自制合金钢电钻钎头的办法，给各矿提供了解决这个困难的办法。
    华北国营煤矿快速掘进工人代表会议扫除了推广马六孩掘进组先进经验的思想障碍，因此，在会议结束时，各矿代表都纷纷表示回矿后要带领全矿掘进工人，全面地推广“马六孩多孔道循环掘进工作法”。代表们在离开大同煤矿时，还恳切地对马六孩说：“你是咱们华北煤矿掘进工人的旗帜，今后在工作中再有啥新的创造，一定要给咱写个信，告诉咱，让咱们共同努力提高煤矿的掘进效率！”
