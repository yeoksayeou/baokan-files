Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: Paris dispatch: From February 11th to 19th, the French National Assembly discussed, amidst fierce arguments, the question of approving France's participation in the so-called "European Army" proposed by the Faure government. The discussion showed that this war plan, which seeks to revive the former Hitler Wehrmacht and place the French army under US control, has encountered strong resistance in France.

The French National Assembly began discussing the so-called "European Army" issue on the eve of the US-British-French foreign ministers' meeting preparing for the North Atlantic aggressive bloc's Lisbon conference. Therefore, the United States urgently hoped that the French parliament could smoothly pass the "European Army" plan so that the three foreign ministers' meeting and the Lisbon conference could make further decisions on implementing this plan. However, the broad masses of the French people, who had suffered deeply from Nazi poison, fiercely opposed rearming their enemies under any guise. This increasingly strong resistance had a major impact on the National Assembly's discussion. The French bourgeois newspaper "Combat" described the scene in parliament on the 12th: "The first day was unfavorable to the government. Foreign Minister Schuman spoke for three-quarters of an hour in a silent parliament, with only weak applause from the Popular Republican Party benches. But when the questioners spoke, the atmosphere in the chamber changed, and people gave explosive applause." In the National Assembly, Communist Party member Fajon spoke against the "European Army" plan, pointing out that this plan would allow West Germany to dominate Western Europe and make "the French army not be a French army." Even former French Prime Minister Daladier, leader of the Radical Socialist Party, and former Navy Chief of Staff Mondey, of the Popular Republican Party, vehemently criticized the "European Army" plan. Mondey said that this plan was "more of an American creation" than "a product of Europe"; it was a means of covering up West German rearmament. The parliament debated the "European Army" issue for three consecutive days, and accusations against the government's proposal became increasingly intense.

In this situation, Faure, seeing that his request had no hope of being accepted, resorted to blackmail, presenting a motion of confidence to the parliament on the 14th. However, the national force against arming West Germany was so strong that Faure could not cobble together a majority to guarantee the passage of his confidence motion. At this time, another French government crisis was on the verge of breaking out, and it was bound to affect the upcoming three foreign ministers' meeting and the Lisbon conference. This situation not only alarmed Faure but also the United States. According to an Associated Press dispatch from London on the 14th, on the very night that Faure presented the confidence motion, US Secretary of State Acheson, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and French Foreign Minister Schuman held an emergency meeting "to discuss ways to help the tottering French government overcome the major hurdle of rearming West Germany." Under US direction, when the National Assembly was about to hold a vote of confidence on the "European Army" issue on the 16th, Faure suddenly requested a recess in order to gain time to conduct behind-the-scenes deals with right-wing socialist leader who had already indicated their opposition to the European Army plan. Finally, the two sides managed to concoct a trap, and Faure presented to the parliament an amendment to the original European Army plan, stipulating that West German soldiers should not be conscripted until the relevant countries had ratified the treaty on the "European Army," and that the US and Britain should station troops on the European continent to "guarantee" France's "immunity from aggression." Then, with the support of the right-wing Socialists, Faure barely forced the National Assembly to pass the vote of confidence in him with a narrow majority of only forty votes.

However, although the French National Assembly has passed this so-called "European Army plan" under US high pressure, this act of the French ruling group selling out the interests of the French nation can only bring it a more serious political crisis. A telecommunications agency dispatch from Paris on the 19th pointed out that when the National Assembly held a vote of confidence, many members ignored their own party's decisions and voted against the government on their own. Throughout the National Assembly's debate, the bourgeois public opinion of the North Atlantic bloc had been afraid that the Faure government, which had been in power for less than a month, would collapse again. Even the United Press acknowledged when reporting the end of the French National Assembly's debate on the "European Army" that "this is the first time since the war that the life of the French government has depended on a vote of confidence on foreign policy issues."

    美国奴役西欧的“欧洲军”计划
    在法国遭到强大阻力
    美国施用高压始迫使法议会通过
    【新华社二十日讯】巴黎消息：二月十一日至十九日，法国国民议会在激烈争吵声中讨论了富尔政府所提要求批准法国参加所谓“欧洲军”的问题。讨论的情形表明：这个想使前希特勒国防军复活并把法国军队置于美国控制之下的战争计划，已经在法国遭到了强大的阻力。
    法国国民议会开始讨论所谓“欧洲军”问题时，正是为北大西洋侵略集团里斯本会议作准备的美、英、法三国外长会议的前夕。因此，美国方面迫切地希望法国议会能顺利通过“欧洲军”计划，以便三外长会议和里斯本会议能在实施这个计划方面，作出进一步的决定。但是，曾饱受纳粹荼毒的法国广大人民，却猛烈地反对在任何一种幌子下重新武装他们的仇人。这种越来越强大的反抗，对国民议会的讨论产生了重大的影响。法国资产阶级的“战斗报”在十二日描写议会内的景象说：“第一天对政府就是不利的。外交部长舒曼在鸦雀无声的议会中讲了三刻钟的话，只有人民共和党席上发出了微弱掌声。但是质问者发言时，会场气氛就变了，人们发出了爆炸般的掌声。”在国民议会中，共产党议员法戎发言反对“欧洲军”计划，指出这个计划会使西德得以独霸西欧，并且使“法国军队不成其为法国的军队”。甚至法国前总理、激进社会党头子达拉第和前海军处处长、人民共和党的蒙德依，都猛烈抨击这个“欧洲军”计划。蒙德依说：这个计划与其说是“欧洲的产物”，不如说是“美国的创作”；它是掩盖西德重新武装的手段。议会对“欧洲军”问题一连激辩了三天，对政府提案的指责越来越剧烈。
    在这种情形下，富尔看到他的要求没有被接受的希望，就采取要胁手段，在十四日向议会提出要求投信任票。但是，全国反对武装西德的力量是如此强大，以致富尔竟无法拼凑好一个多数来保证他的信任案获得通过。这时，又一次的法国政府危机眼看就要爆发，而且它势必影响到就要举行的三国外长会议和里斯本会议。这种情况不仅使富尔，而且使美国方面都着了慌。据美联社伦敦十四日电透露，就在富尔提出信任案的当天晚上，美国国务卿艾奇逊和英国外交大臣艾登、法国外交部长舒曼举行了紧急会议，“商讨办法来协助摇摇欲倒的法国政府度过重新武装西德这个大难关”。在美国指使之下，富尔在十六日国民议会要对“欧洲军”问题举行信任投票时，一变而要求休会，以便取得时间和已经表示要反对欧洲军计划的右翼社会党头子进行幕后交易。最后，双方总算做好了一个圈套，由富尔再向议会提出了一项对原来的欧洲军计划的修正案，规定在各有关国家批准关于“欧洲军”条约之前，不得征召西德士兵，并且要求美、英在欧洲大陆驻军“保证”法国“不受侵略”。然后，在右翼社会党的支持下，富尔才勉强地逼迫国民议会以仅仅四十票的微弱多数通过了对他的信任案。
    但是，尽管法国国民议会已在美国的高压下通过了这个所谓“欧洲军计划”，法国统治集团这种出卖法兰西民族利益的行径，却只能给自己带来更严重的政治危机。电通社巴黎十九日电指出：国民议会举行信任投票时，许多议员都不理自己政党的决定，迳自投票反对政府。在国民议会整个辩论过程中，北大西洋集团的资产阶级舆论一直都在害怕上台还不到一个月的富尔政府又会垮台。甚至合众社在报道法国国民议会结束对“欧洲军”的辩论时也承认：“法国政府的生命系于外交政策问题的信任投票上，这还是战后以来第一次。”
