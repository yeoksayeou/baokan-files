In terms of accelerating the turnover of working capital, they guarantee to turn it over eight times in 1952. They guarantee to cultivate a model workshop this year; and to cultivate at least one model group in each workshop.

The National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China believes that the friendly competition launched by all the employees of the state-owned Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory to all printing and dyeing workers nationwide is of utmost importance for realizing Chairman Mao's call for increased production and thrift within the national printing and dyeing industry. The state-owned Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory achieved great production results last year, and costs were significantly reduced. This year, all employees of this factory actively responded to Chairman Mao's call for increased production and thrift, put forward the fighting goal of reducing costs by another 14% based on last year, and set specific fighting conditions to challenge all printing and dyeing workers nationwide. The National Committee of the Textile Workers' Union of China hopes that all printing and dyeing workers, after studying the challenge conditions of the Qingdao Printing and Dyeing Factory workers, will rise up to meet the challenge based on their specific circumstances and strive to realize Chairman Mao's call for increased production and thrift.

    国营青岛印染厂全体职工
    向全国印染厂职工发起增产节约竞赛
    国营青岛印染厂全体职工，为实现毛主席增产节约的号召，以支持中国人民志愿军，加强国防建设和经济建设，向全国印染厂职工发起友谊竞赛的挑战。他们的竞赛条件，已经在一月八日召开的四届三次职工代表大会上讨论通过。
    在产量方面，他们保证提前二个月完成中央人民政府纺织工业部分配的任务。他们保证的产品质量标准：印花布的正布率为百分之九十四；纳富妥色布正布率为百分之九十五；一九○号士林蓝布正布率为百分之九十五；六○号士林蓝布正布率为百分之九十六；三○号士林蓝布正布率为百分之九十七；精元布正布率为百分之九十八；硫化元青正布率为百分之九十八；硫化蓝布正布率为百分之九十八；硫化灰布正布率为百分之九十七；漂布正布率为百分之九十八点五。在一九五一年度的基础上，他们保证再降低加工成本百分之十四。他们保证消灭责任事故，预防自然事故。他们保证：组织百分之九十八以上文盲参加文化学习；要在一九五一年度的基础上再扫除文盲百分之五十；到年底止，要使文盲人数不超过全厂职工总人数的百分之十五；组织百分之九十以上的工人参加业余学校。他们保证做好安全装置，进行安全操作法和卫生教育；保证在一九五一年度的基础上，再减少工伤人数百分之五十。他们保证达到百分之九十七以上的出勤率（包括公出和学习人数在内）。在加速流动资金周转方面，他们保证一九五二年内周转八次。他们保证在今年内培养一个模范车间；在每一车间至少培养一个模范小组。
    中国纺织工会全国委员会认为国营青岛印染厂全体职工向全国印染职工发起友谊竞赛，对于在全国印染厂的范围内实现毛主席增产节约的号召有极重要的意义。国营青岛印染厂去年的生产成绩很大，成本显著降低。今年这个厂的全体职工积极响应毛主席关于增产节约的号召，提出在去年的基础上，再降低成本百分之十四的奋斗目标，并订出具体的奋斗条件，向全国印染职工挑战。中国纺织工会全国委员会希望全国印染职工研究了青岛印染厂职工的挑战条件后，根据自己的具体情况，奋起应战，为实现毛主席关于增产节约的号召而奋斗。
