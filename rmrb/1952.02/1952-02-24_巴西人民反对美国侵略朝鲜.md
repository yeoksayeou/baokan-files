    Brazilian People Oppose American Aggression Against Korea
    Qiaozhi Yamaduo
    Editor's Note: This is a passionate article written for this publication by the great Brazilian poet, one of the recipients of the Stalin International Prize "For Strengthening Peace Among Nations," Qiaozhi Yamaduo. Yamaduo, along with the great Cuban poet Nicolás Guillén and his wife, are currently visiting our country. We sincerely welcome our comrades-in-arms in the cause of defending peace.
    American aggression against Korea has aroused great repercussions among the Brazilian people. "Why are the Americans attacking this distant country? Why don't they allow the Koreans to solve their own problems?" Simple people, often frightened by the concept of "aggression" published by the gentlemen of Wall Street in their newspapers, often ask themselves this way. The Brazilian people yearn to see their motherland completely liberated from the shackles of American imperialism. However, many patriots have not previously regarded the struggle for liberation and the struggle to defend peace as a whole. Some even have an extreme idea that the struggle to defend peace will hinder the struggle for national liberation. However, as the Korean War progressed, tens of thousands of Brazilians clearly realized the close connection between the struggle to defend peace and the struggle for national liberation. If the Americans consider the Korean people to be aggressors, then when our people rise up to expel the robbers and foreign oppressors who plunder our property, wouldn't we be considered aggressors one day? At that time, the American army would slaughter our children and destroy our cities.
    On the other hand, when the United States invaded Korea, the war came to our eyes. Before that time, as far as Brazilians were concerned, war was still a distant thing, taking place in countries far away from us, and we could only know its details by reading newspapers. However, shortly after the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea, the US State Department began to force the Brazilian government to send troops to Korea. American imperialism demanded that Brazil send at least 100,000 people to serve as cannon fodder and participate in the massacre in Korea. The slavish and traitorous Brazilian government quickly agreed to send troops and took preparatory steps to dispatch troops.
    However, at this moment, the Brazilian people immediately rose up to protest. They organized to stop sending troops abroad and launched a growing mass movement across the country: marches, rallies, condemnations of the government, and strikes. The movement was particularly strong and powerful among workers, peasants, and intellectuals, and even the military was involved in the movement. On one occasion, a military review magazine run by some Brazilian officers published an editorial opposing the Brazilian government's dispatch of troops to Korea and condemning American aggression. This incident caused a great shock: The US State Department insisted that the Brazilian government stop the publication of this military review and punish the officers in charge of the magazine. However, most of the officers rose up in opposition, so the magazine was able to continue to be sold, and the positions of the officers in charge of the magazine remained unchanged. The protest movement expanded to such an extent that the government was forced to temporarily put aside the matter of sending troops abroad. The gentlemen of the government believed that before organizing troops to go abroad, they must stifle this people's movement that opposes sending troops abroad.
    They launched a brutal reactionary suppression of patriots, peace fighters, communists, and all other people who protested against the government. On November 7, 1950, a woman named Eliza Branco—a family handicraft worker—displayed a piece of paper to the soldiers as the army passed by, on which was written: "Soldiers, our children, never go to Korea!" She was immediately arrested and beaten and tortured. When arrested, she was pregnant, and torture took away the little life in her womb. At the same time, the court sentenced her to four years and four months in prison. Air Force Captain Yage Libote Yaseveito, the leader of the military opposition to North American aggressive ambitions, was also sentenced to four years in prison. Writer and editor-in-chief of a Rio de Janeiro newspaper, Peter Moda, was also sentenced to two years in prison for writing articles against sending troops to Korea. Many patriots were charged with crimes and arrested by the hundreds and thousands. Some people were massacred during police suppression of mass demonstrations.
    However, the Brazilian people were not intimidated. They knew that the crisis had not passed, and the government was still trying to send troops to Korea. In fact, the Wall Street masters have once again demanded that Brazil send 100,000 troops, and the Brazilian government has once again agreed to them. Therefore, the Brazilian people took to the streets again to protest. The protest movement possessed such a huge and deep scale, it included such a large population, that it not only won another victory in preventing the dispatch of troops, but it also freed Eliza Branco. A year ago, the court that sentenced Eliza Branco to four years in prison for the "crime" of opposing the dispatch of troops, today, under the pressure of the people, had to announce that this fact did not constitute a crime. And Eliza Branco finally regained her freedom after being in prison for a year. This is a great victory for the Brazilian people.
    The Brazilian people vow to stop the government from sending troops to participate in the crime of aggression against Korea. They understand that they are inseparable from the Korean people and the Chinese people. Today, in Brazil, there is no more popular slogan than this: "Never send a Brazilian soldier to participate in the American aggression against Korea." This slogan is written on the walls of the city and is also recited by the peasants outside the urban area. Despite police terror and the pressure of American imperialism, this slogan still guarantees our victory. The Brazilian people will never send their children to serve as accomplices of North American imperialists. The Brazilian people must stand with the people of many other countries and force the warmongers to accept peace.

    巴西人民反对美国侵略朝鲜
    乔治·亚马多
    编者按：这是巴西大诗人、斯大林“加强国际和平”国际奖金获得者之一乔治·亚马多为本刊所写的一篇热情的文章。亚马多和古巴大诗人尼古拉·吉里安夫妇一起，正在我国访问。我们恳挚地欢迎我们的保卫和平事业的战友们。
    美国对朝鲜的侵略，在巴西人民中引起了巨大的反响。“为什么美国佬要进攻这个遥远的国家呢？为什么他们不允许朝鲜人自己解决自己的问题呢？”那些被华尔街先生们公布在他们的报纸上的“侵略”概念所骇住的单纯的人们往往这样自问。巴西人民渴望看到他们的祖国从美帝国主义的束缚下得到完全的解放。不过，许许多多的爱国分子过去还没有把争取解放的斗争和保卫和平的斗争当作一个整体看待。有些人甚至还存在着一种极端的想法，那就是：保卫和平的斗争会使争取民族解放的斗争受到阻碍。但是，随着朝鲜战争的进行，成千成万的巴西人清楚地认识到了保卫和平的斗争和争取民族解放的斗争之间的紧密关联。如果美国人认为朝鲜人民是侵略者，那么，当我们的人民起来，驱逐掠夺我们财产的强盗和外来的压迫者的时候，难道我们不会有被认为是侵略者的那一天么？那时，美国的军队会屠杀我们的儿女，炸毁我们的城市。
    另一方面，当美国一侵略朝鲜，战争就降临到我们眼前。在那个时候以前，就巴西人看来，战争仍然是一个遥远的东西，它在距我们很远的国家进行，我们只是通过阅读报纸才能知道它的究竟。但是，在美国发动侵朝战争不久之后，美国国务院就开始强迫巴西政府出兵朝鲜。美帝国主义至少要求巴西派十万人去充当炮灰，参与朝鲜的大屠杀。奴颜婢膝的巴西卖国政府，很快地就答应了出兵，并且采取了派遣军队的准备步骤。
    可是，正在这个时候，巴西人民立刻起来抗议。他们为阻止派兵出国而组织起来，在全国展开了日益壮大的群众运动：游行，集会，谴责政府和罢工斗争。运动在工人、农民和知识分子中开展得特别强而有力，甚至连军队也卷入了这个运动。有一次，一些巴西军官们所办的一个军事评论杂志上发表了一篇反对巴西政府出兵朝鲜并谴责美国侵略的社论。这一事件引起了极大的震动：美国国务院硬要巴西政府停止这个军事评论的刊行，并且惩办主持这个杂志的军官。但是，大多数的军官都群起反对，于是这一杂志得以继续销行，主持这个杂志的军官的职位仍得保持不动。抗议运动是这样地扩展开来，以致政府不得不被迫暂时把派兵出国的事情搁在一边。政府的先生们认为：在组织军队出国以前，必须扼杀这种反对派兵出国的人民运动。
    他们向爱国分子、和平斗士、共产党人以及其他一切对政府进行抗议的人民发动了残酷的反动镇压。一九五○年十一月七日，一个名叫伊丽莎·布兰卡的妇女——一个家庭手艺工人——在军队开过时把一张纸片展示在兵士们面前，上面写的是：“兵士们，我们的孩子们，千万别到朝鲜去！”于是她立即就被逮捕，并且遭到殴打和拷问。当被捕时，她正怀孕在身，酷刑拷打夺走了她腹中的小生命。同时，法庭判处她四年另四个月的徒刑。反对北美侵略野心的军事反对派领袖、航空大队长亚格利伯脱·亚塞维托也被判处四年徒刑。作家兼里约热内卢某日报社社长的彼得·摩达也由于曾经写过反对派兵赴朝的文章而被判处两年徒刑。许多爱国者一律被加以罪名，而成百成千地遭到逮捕。还有一些人在警察镇压群众示威时遭到屠杀。
    但是，巴西人民并没有被吓倒。他们知道危机尚未过去，政府依然企图出兵朝鲜。事实上，华尔街主子们已再度要求巴西派遣十万军队，而巴西政府又再一次答应了他们。因此，巴西人民又再出动到街头上，进行抗议。抗议运动具备着如此巨大和深入的规模，它包括着如此广大的人口，以致它不仅在阻止出兵上赢得又一次胜利，而且它也使伊丽莎·布兰卡获得自由。一年前，以反对派兵“罪”而判处伊丽莎·布兰卡四年徒刑的法庭，今天在人民的压力下不得不宣布：这一事实不能构成罪行。而伊丽莎·布兰卡在入狱一年以后终于恢复自由。这是巴西人民的一次巨大的胜利。
    巴西人民誓愿阻止政府派兵参加侵略朝鲜的罪行。他们明白自己是和朝鲜人民、中国人民分不开的。今天，在巴西，再没有比这更为大众化的口号了，那就是：“决不派一个巴西士兵参加美国对朝鲜的侵略。”这口号被写在城市的墙壁上，同样也被城区以外的农民传诵着。尽管在警察恐怖和美帝国主义的压力下，这口号仍然保证着我们的胜利。巴西人民决不会送他们的子弟去充当北美帝国主义者的帮凶。巴西人民必定和许多其它国家的人民站在一起，强迫战争贩子们接受和平。
