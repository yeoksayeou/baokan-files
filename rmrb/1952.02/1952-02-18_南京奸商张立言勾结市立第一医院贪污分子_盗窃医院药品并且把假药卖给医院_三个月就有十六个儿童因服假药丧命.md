Nanjing profiteer Zhang Liyan, manager of the Likang Pharmacy on Zhonghua Road, colluded with corrupt elements in the Municipal First Hospital to steal state assets and sell fake drugs to the Municipal First Hospital, seriously endangering the health of patients. Many patients lost their lives after taking fake drugs. After the launch of the anti-bribery, anti-tax evasion, anti-theft of state assets, anti-shoddy work and materials, and anti-theft of state economic intelligence movement in the business community, profiteer Zhang Liyan and corrupt elements formed a "life-and-death alliance" and played the trick of "false confession," refusing to tell the truth. The People's Government arrested the profiteer Zhang Liyan on February 6 and confiscated all his property.

Before liberation, profiteer Zhang Liyan was a broker who ran a Western medicine business. He lived across from the Municipal First Hospital and specialized in attracting and colluding with the hospital's employees to steal medicines and medical equipment. After liberation, not only did he not repent, but on the contrary, in order to achieve his personal goal of "getting rich," in September 1949, he colluded with Wu Yuzhi, the former director of general affairs, Ye Yuntao, the former warehouse manager, and Yang Naikai, the former purchasing agent, all of whom had been streamlined from the Municipal First Hospital, to jointly open the Likang Pharmacy. He used his old connections to attract Gao Dongfu, the director of the accounting office, Huang Enpei, the cashier, and Jie Chunan and Chen Huizhen, the accountants, all of whom were still employed by the hospital, to join the scheme and engage in corruption together. In addition, profiteer Zhang Liyan used despicable means such as bribery, treating guests, and giving gifts to vigorously attract and buy off staff in the hospital's general affairs section, accounting office, pharmacy, and other departments. Then, he went a step further in carrying out illegal activities such as stealing state economic intelligence and stealing state assets, colluding with pharmacists Pan Chengzong, Shi Suzhen, and Li Jingxian, as well as warehouse administrator Xiang Bingrong, to steal large quantities of medicines and medical equipment from the hospital, such as glucose, anti-inflammatory tablets, alcohol, cod liver oil, bandages, and medicine bottles, and sell them to the Likang Pharmacy at low prices. Profiteer Zhang Liyan then used the relationship of purchasing agent Chen Yongkui to sell them to the Municipal First Hospital at high prices. When the hospital needed a certain medicine, Zhang Liyan would quickly collect it on the market. On one occasion, he even colluded with ten pharmacies, including Shengsheng, Dasheng, Kangsheng, and Shijie, to collectively raise bids, raise prices, and seek exorbitant profits. After Gao Dongfu, the director of the accounting office of the Municipal First Hospital, and others became the lackeys of profiteer Zhang Liyan, the hospital's accounting office actually became Likang Pharmacy's private "bank," and profiteer Zhang Liyan often used the relationship of Gao Dongfu and others to swindle a large amount of funds by means of "bad checks."

What is even more hateful is that in order to get rich, profiteer Zhang Liyan disregarded the lives of patients and colluded with the Nanjing Peihe Pharmaceutical Factory to manufacture fake drugs similar to sulfathiazole and sulfadiazine anti-inflammatory tablets and sell them to the Municipal First Hospital. He also often colluded with corrupt elements such as Xiang Bingrong to steal good medicines from the hospital and replace them with fake or substandard medicines such as anti-inflammatory tablets, glucose, vitamin C, and penicillin, seriously endangering the health of patients. For example, on August 3, 1950, patient Hou Tongzhi suffered from sepsis and gangrene in his right leg. After a detailed diagnosis by the hospital's doctors, he underwent surgery and was given anti-inflammatory tablets and penicillin injections. However, the anti-inflammatory tablets and penicillin sold to the hospital by profiteer Zhang Liyan were all fake or substandard, which resulted in the patient's condition worsening. By the time the doctors discovered that the drugs were ineffective and hurriedly injected streptomycin, it was too late, and the patient's condition went from mild to severe, resulting in death. Such examples are too numerous to mention. In the three months from July to September 1950 alone, out of the 40 children who were treated at the hospital for bacterial dysentery and bronchopneumonia, 16 died after taking fake anti-inflammatory tablets and injecting ineffective penicillin.

Profiteer Zhang Liyan not only stole medicines from the Municipal First Hospital but also used the same method to steal medicines and assets from the East China Military Region Hospital, the Public Security Hospital, the Nanjing University Hospital, the East China Medical Clinic, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government Health Bureau, and the Telecommunications Bureau Clinic, harming the health of many patients. The profiteer thus built his own happiness on the suffering of patients and opened a large shop on the bones of the dead. Profiteer Zhang Liyan, who was just a small "single entrepreneur" with a capital of only 3.5 million yuan in the early days of liberation, has transformed into a rich boss with a capital of nearly 200 million yuan.

    南京奸商张立言勾结市立第一医院贪污分子
    盗窃医院药品并且把假药卖给医院
    三个月就有十六个儿童因服假药丧命
    南京市中华路立康药房经理、奸商张立言，勾结市立第一医院贪污分子，盗窃国家资财，并拿假药卖给市立第一医院，严重地危害了病人健康，曾有不少病人因服假药丧失生命。工商界反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗骗国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动开展后，奸商张立言又和贪污分子订立“生死同盟”，并玩弄“假坦白”的把戏，坚不吐实。人民政府已于二月六日把奸商张立言逮捕法办，并查封他的全部财产。
    奸商张立言在解放前是一个跑西药生意的掮客，家住市立第一医院对门，专门拉拢和勾结这个医院的职工，盗窃医院的药品和卫生器材。解放后，不但没有丝毫悔改，相反地，为了达到他个人“发财”的目的，在一九四九年九月间，勾结市立第一医院被精简的前事务主任吴雨之、前仓库管理员叶韵涛及前采购员杨乃开等三人合开立康药房，并利用他旧有的关系，拉拢在职的会计室主任高东孚、出纳员黄恩培、会计员接楚南、陈慧珍等四人入股狼狈为奸，共同舞弊。此外，奸商张立言又用贿赂、请客、送礼等卑鄙手段，大肆拉拢和收买医院内部的总务科、会计室、药局等部门的工作人员。接着就得寸进尺地进行盗窃国家经济情报及盗窃国家资财等非法活动，勾结这个医院药剂师潘承忠、史素珍、李景仙及库房管理员项炳荣等，把医院的药品和卫生器材如葡萄糖、消炎片、酒精、鱼肝油、绷带、药瓶等大批物资偷窃出来，低价卖给立康药房，奸商张立言再通过采购员陈永魁的关系，用高价卖给市立第一医院。医院需要某种药品时，张立言就迅速地在市面上收罗。某次甚至曾勾结了生生、达生、康生、世界等十家药房集体抬标，抬高物价，牟取暴利。市立第一医院会计室主任高东孚等变成了奸商张立言的走狗后，医院会计室实际上成了立康药房的私人“行庄”，奸商张立言经常通过高东孚等人的关系，用“空头支票”方式套骗大量资金。
    更可恨的是奸商张立言为了个人发财，竟不顾病人的死活，勾结了南京市培和制药厂，制造类似消发噻唑、消发地亚净等消炎片的假药卖给市立第一医院，并经常勾结贪污分子项炳荣等以消炎片、葡萄糖、维他命西及配尼西林等假药或次货盗换这个医院的好药，严重地危害了病人的健康。例如在一九五○年八月三日病人侯通知，患败血病，右腿坏疽，这个医院的医师经详细诊断后，一面进行手术，一面给病人服用消炎片及注射配尼西林，可是奸商张立言售给医院的消炎片及配尼西林全是假药或次货，结果使病人病势反趋严重，及至医师发现这种药品无效，而急忙注射链霉素时，已经来不及了，病人侯通知的病情就由轻转重，以致死亡。这样的例子是举不胜举，单以一九五○年七月到九月的三个月间，患细菌性痢疾及支气管肺炎到这个医院医治的四十个小儿中，因服用了假的消炎片及注射了已失效用的配尼西林，就死亡了十六人。
    奸商张立言不仅盗骗了市立第一医院的药品，同时还用同样的方式，盗骗了华东军区医院、公安医院、南大医院、华东医务所、南京市人民政府卫生局、电信局医务所等卫生单位的药品和资财，损害了广大病人的健康。奸商就这样把自己的幸福建筑在病人的痛苦上，在死者的白骨上开起大店号来。奸商张立言从解放初期仅有三百五十万元资本的一个小“单帮客”，竟一变而成拥有将近二亿资本的阔老板了。　　　　　（南京新华日报）
