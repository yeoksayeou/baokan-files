    Yunnan Daily Self-Criticizes Error of Publishing Incomplete Map

    Editor Comrades: We fully accept the criticism of our error in the People's Daily "Letters from Readers" column on December 11th of last year, in the letter "Newspapers Must Publish Complete and Accurate Maps." The reason for this error is that we only considered the problem from a technical perspective, and did not make thorough political considerations. We only treated the map as an illustration for the "Introduction to Nansha Islands and Xisha Islands" material. Because the material did not mention "Dongsha Islands," we also omitted "Dongsha Islands" when drawing the map.

    In addition to learning from this lesson and resolving to handle similar problems with responsibility, care, and thoroughness in future work, we will also strengthen the political study of our editorial staff to prevent the recurrence of such errors.

    云南日报检讨刊登不完整的形势图的错误
    编辑同志：我们完全接受去年十二月十一日人民日报“读者来信”栏在“报纸刊登形势图必须完整无误”一信中对于我们的批评。产生这一错误的原因，是由于我们只从技术上考虑问题，没有从政治上作周密的考虑，只把形势图当成“南威岛和西沙群岛介绍”这一资料的图解，资料中没有提到“东沙群岛”，我们在绘图时也把“东沙群岛”漏掉了。
    我们除了接受这一教训，决在以后的工作中认真负责、周详慎重地处理类似问题外，并要加强编辑人员的政治学习，以防止错误的发生。
