    Happy Old Age - Visiting Military Family Member Grandma Cheng in Zheng Huangqi Village, Beijing Suburbs
    You Ru
    Grandma Cheng, a military family member in Zheng Huangqi Village in the suburbs of Beijing, is over sixty years old, but whether it's daily life or work, she's as good as any young person. People praise her, "Look how energetic Grandma Cheng is!" She then tells others, "Now everything goes my way, everything makes me happy. I really feel more and more energetic, like I've become a teenager again!"
    On New Year's Day, I went to see her with the village civil affairs committee member. She was sunbathing in the yard, smilingly watching the beige old hen, the big red rooster, and more than a dozen other plump chickens eating. I said, "Grandma, hello! Happy New Year!" "The principal and the elementary school students just came, and they even brought gifts. Now you're here again! How can I accept this!" Grandma Cheng said as she warmly pulled us into the house to sit down.
    This is a large, north-facing main room with bright glass windows. Rice bins, washbasins, wardrobes... make the spacious room feel full, but everything is arranged neatly and orderly. During the land reform, Grandma Cheng was allocated six mu of irrigated land. Last autumn, despite the drought and poor harvest, she still harvested more than seven shi of corn. Mentioning the autumn harvest last year brought Grandma Cheng a pleasant memory: "The day we harvested the corn was really lively. Seven or eight young people, both men and women, warmly said to me, 'Grandma, we're here to harvest your corn!' After saying that, some peeled, some chopped, more enthusiastic than if they were doing their own work. In no time, six mu of corn had been harvested. I was so happy that I didn't know what to say. 'My son is at the front, and every young person is as dear to me as my own children.' On that hot day, I watched them, their foreheads sweating and their faces red from the sun. My heart ached, and I hurriedly asked them to drink water. I shouted loudly, 'Good children, good girls, take a break quickly, don't wear yourselves out!'"
    Grandma Cheng loves her little grandson very much. She took out the children's photos (the children had gone out to play) and showed them to us, telling us about two different life experiences: Before the liberation of Beijing, Grandma Cheng relied on needlework to make a living, never knowing where the next meal would come from. Because of poverty, the children fell ill, and there was no money for treatment. Grandma Cheng gave birth to ten children, but only raised three sons. Talking about her life after liberation, she pointed to the photos and said contentedly, "Chairman Mao brought happiness to the children. Their parents have turned over, and life is affluent. The children eat well and are chubby, like little calves. How can a grandma not be happy looking at them?" As she said this, Grandma Cheng laughed, and everyone else laughed too.
    "Grandma, do you have any difficulties? You can..." Before I could finish speaking, Grandma Cheng interrupted me. She dismissively said:
    "What difficulties do I have? What should be planted is planted, what should be harvested is harvested, and the masses 'support' me on time (referring to substitute farming). Last spring, I bought two piglets. The pigs grew up, accumulated money, and accumulated manure, so I don't have to worry about manure for the fields. Talking about seeds, I have already prepared all the spring planting seeds. Speaking of watching operas, on the Mid-Autumn Festival, I went to the village office to watch an opera. The courtyard was packed with people. Hearing that a military family member had arrived, they greeted me and made way for me, 'supporting' me all the way to a seat in the front row. At that time, my heart was pounding with joy. I thought: If Ji Kang knew in the army how happy his mother is, how happy would he be!"

    快乐的老人  ——访问北京市郊区正黄旗村军属程大娘
    友如 
    北京市郊区正黄旗村军属程大娘六十多岁啦，不论过日子，做工作，她都比得上年轻人。人们称赞她：“看程老太太的精神多棒啊！”她就向别人说：“现在事事遂心，想到那儿，那儿叫人高兴，我真是越过越有劲，像年轻了十几岁哩！”
    元旦那天，我和村民政委员一块去看她。她正在院里晒太阳，笑咪咪地望着那米色老草鸡、大红公鸡和另外十几只肥大的鸡吃食。我说：“大娘好啊，给您拜年来啦！”“校长领着小学生们刚来过，还送来礼品，现在你们又来啦，这叫我怎么承当！”程大娘一面说着，一面亲热地拉着我们进屋里坐下。
    这是一座坐北向阳的大堂屋，镶着明亮的玻璃窗；米缸面盆，放衣服的柜橱……使宽敞的房子里显得满腾腾的，但都摆得有条有理。程大娘在土地改革中分得六亩水浇田。去年秋天天旱歉收，还收了七石多玉米。提起去年秋收的情景，引起程大娘
    一段快乐的回忆：“收棒子那天真热闹，男男女女七八个年轻人，亲热地向我说：‘大妈，我们给您收棒子来啦！’说罢，撇的撇，砍的砍，比干自己活干的还欢，不大一会儿，六亩棒子就收割完啦。我一时高兴得不知说啥好，‘我儿到前方了，一个个年轻人和儿女一样亲啊。’大热的天，我看着他们一个个额上冒着汗，脸膛儿晒得通红，心里疼得慌，忙着叫他们喝水，我大声嚷着：好孩子，好姑娘，快歇歇吧，不要累坏呀！”
    程大娘很喜爱她的小孙孙。她拿着孩子们的像片（孩子们出去玩了）让我们看，向我们讲述两种不同的生活经历：程大娘在北京解放前，靠着做针线活来维持生活，吃过这顿饭，下顿饭没着落。因为生活贫困，孩子们生病，没钱医治，程大娘生过十个儿女，只养活了哥儿三个。谈到解放后的生活，她指着像片满意地说：“毛主席给孩子带来的福啊，爹妈翻身了，生活宽裕了，孩子们吃的胖胖地，像个小牛犊，当奶奶的看着怎能不高兴。”话说到这里，程大娘乐了，大家也乐了。
    “大娘还有什么困难吗？可以……”一句话没说完，程大娘便打断了我的话，她不以为然地说：
    “我还有什么困难呢？该种的种，该收的收，群众都按时‘拥护’（指代耕）啦；去年春天我买了两条小猪，猪养大了，积了钱又积了粪，地里的粪不用愁啦；你说种籽吧，春种的种子，我已操持齐全；就说看戏吧，八月节那天，我到村公所看戏，院子里黑压压坐了一片人，听说军属来了，又是打招呼，又是让道，把我一直‘拥护’到前排座上。当时，我高兴得心蹦蹦跳，我想：纪康在部队里知道妈这样高兴，他该多么高兴啊！”
