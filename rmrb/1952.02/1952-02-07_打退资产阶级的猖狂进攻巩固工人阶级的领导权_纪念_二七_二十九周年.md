    Repulse the Frenzied Attacks of the Bourgeoisie and Consolidate the Leadership of the Working Class
    —Commemorating the 29th Anniversary of the "February 7th" Incident
    The great Chinese working class’s first bloody revolutionary struggle in Chinese history—the "February 7th" strike of the Jinghan Railway workers—is now twenty-nine years in the past. In the nearly thirty years since "February 7th," the Chinese working class, represented by the Chinese Communist Party, has fully demonstrated that it is the most advanced and most revolutionary class of the Chinese people. The Chinese Communist Party has led the people of the whole country to achieve the great victory of the people's democratic revolution and establish the People's Republic of China. The broad masses of the working class have played a leading and exemplary role in various practical struggles for the victory of the revolutionary war and the construction of a new democratic society. All these fully prove that only the working class is the sole leading class of our country.
    Under the leadership of the Chinese working class and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have, since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, carried out the great movements of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, land reform, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries, and have won great victories. They have also achieved great successes on the national defense front, the economic and financial front, and the cultural and educational front. The leadership of the Chinese working class and the victories already won have not only provided the most reliable guarantee for the interests of our country and the broad masses of the people, but also greatly developed the interests of all classes participating in the people's democratic united front of our country. One obvious fact is that the Chinese national bourgeoisie, under the leadership of the working class for the past three years, has been freed from the heavy shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and has obtained unprecedented benefits that they never had in the twenty-odd years of the Kuomintang reactionary rule.
    During the period of the New Democratic Revolution, as long as the Chinese national bourgeoisie recognizes and accepts the leadership of the working class, abides by the Common Program, abides by the laws and decrees of the People's Government, and recognizes and accepts the leadership of the state-owned economy, they will have a full legal status politically and economically, and can play a certain role. In their legally operated enterprises, they will inevitably obtain certain profits, which is beyond doubt. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese bourgeoisie has made considerable efforts in the production of necessities, donations to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and tax payment, which is also a fact. However, we must not ignore the frenzied attacks launched against us by the bourgeoisie in the past three years. In its nature, this attack is a direct attack on the leadership of our working class. The bourgeoisie's ideas and behaviors of exploiting the masses, living without labor, harming others to benefit oneself, being profit-oriented, using public office for private gain, engaging in speculation, extravagance and waste, and hedonistic indulgence are eroding our working class ranks everywhere, eroding state organs and their staff, causing incalculable and serious losses to the interests of our country and people. This is why we must vigorously, swiftly, universally, and deeply launch the movement against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy.
    We must not tolerate the bourgeoisie's attack on the leadership of the working class. We fully recognize that the bourgeoisie's management in industry and commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood is needed by our people at the present stage; however, the bourgeoisie's characteristics of harming others to benefit oneself, using public office for private gain, and being profit-oriented often drive them to adopt means that are harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and often drive them to resist, disrupt, and replace the leadership and planning of the working class and the state-owned economy with the anarchy and free competition of capitalist production. We cannot fail to see the reactionary side of the ideological essence of the bourgeoisie. This kind of thought is based on the capitalist private property system on which the bourgeoisie depends for its survival. In order to achieve the selfish and self-interested goal of expanding private property, the bourgeoisie often does not hesitate to engage in corruption, bribery, theft, and plunder, unscrupulously harming the interests of the people and the state to satisfy their corrupt and degenerate extravagant life. Facts have proved that some industrialists and businessmen in our country are not satisfied with the already obtained high profits of 15% to 30%; they even want to use illegal means to obtain profits of 70% or 80% or even higher. This is completely a criminal act that violates the Common Program. The Common Program stipulates that "speculative commerce that disrupts the market must be strictly prohibited," and the pursuit of exorbitant profits by illegal industrialists and businessmen in the bourgeoisie makes them engage in speculative acts that disrupt the market. Similarly, the Common Program stipulates that all citizens have the obligation to pay taxes, but many industrialists and businessmen try every possible means to evade and underpay taxes, with tax evasion and underpayment reaching 20% to 30% in some areas. The Common Program stipulates that "both public and private interests should be taken into consideration" and "both labor and capital should benefit," but many industrialists and businessmen harm public interests to benefit themselves and disregard the interests of the working class everywhere, cruelly exploiting the workers. The Common Program stipulates that the state economy is the leading force of the entire social economy, but many industrialists and businessmen are unwilling to obey this leadership, and they either try to refuse state processing orders or cut corners. The Common Program stipulates that "cherishing public property" is one of the public virtues of all citizens, but many industrialists and businessmen constantly steal state property and damage or destroy state construction projects. More seriously, they also adopted the despicable methods of "sending in" and "pulling over," launching a massive attack on state organs and their staff. All these illegal activities done by the bourgeoisie in the past three years have directly harmed the interests of the state led by the working class. What is this if not a direct attack on the leadership of the working class?
    We call on the working class of the whole country to resolutely rise up, defend and consolidate the leadership of the working class, repulse the frenzied attacks of the bourgeoisie, and strive to thoroughly realize the great goal of transforming the old society and building a new society. This is a fierce class struggle, and we must carry out this great battle heroically with the revolutionary firmness of the working class. All staff and workers in state-owned, public-owned, joint public-private, and private enterprises, firmly stand on the position of the great and glorious working class, unswervingly participate in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy, and relentlessly oppose the illegal acts of bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cutting corners, and stealing state economic intelligence by the bourgeoisie. We must break all sentimentalities and concerns, not be subdued by any threats or inducements, and boldly and unreservedly thoroughly expose and report all the crimes of illegal elements. Each of us is a soldier belonging to the glorious working class, and we must never be captured by the bourgeoisie; we must resolutely eliminate all corrupt and degenerate elements and traitors within ourselves, consolidate and purify our revolutionary ranks.
    The serious phenomena of corruption, waste, and bureaucracy caused by the erosion of bourgeois ideology in our working class ranks must arouse our high vigilance and be resolutely and thoroughly eliminated. In this fierce class struggle, the consciousness of the working class must be increased a hundredfold, and a clear line must be drawn between the thoughts and actions of the bourgeoisie. We must never think that the victory of the revolution in the whole country will ease the class struggle; on the contrary, we must see the more complex situation of the class struggle under the new conditions. Every loyal revolutionary worker should be especially vigilant against the bourgeoisie's insidious conspiracies to corrupt and disintegrate workers, destroy trade unions, and erode the Communist Party and the People's Government. Certain trade union cadres are bought by the bourgeoisie and become trade union scabs who sell out the interests of the working class, and we must clear them out of the leadership organs of the trade unions; certain grassroots organizations of the trade unions are usurped by the bourgeoisie and become tools for maintaining the interests of the bourgeoisie, and we must thoroughly reorganize them. Within the working-class organization, the danger of right-leaning tendencies must be resolutely overcome, especially the right-leaning tendencies of cadres at all levels of trade unions in the implementation of policies. Some trade union cadres, when handling public and private relations, have not emphasized and insisted on the main aspects of state economic leadership and putting public interests before private interests, but have unconditionally taken care of and accommodated the interests of private capitalists; when handling labor-capital relations, they have not emphasized supporting the legitimate demands of the working class, but have one-sidedly emphasized the significance of developing production, which only benefits private capitalists and is not conducive to the masses of workers. These errors must be corrected. In state-owned enterprises, we must resolutely rely on the workers, implement democratic management, and thoroughly eliminate the capitalist methods of forced management; implement the policy of technology serving politics, combining technology with the masses, and oppose the separation of technology from the masses and the purely technical viewpoints of the bourgeoisie; universally and deeply mobilize the masses and strengthen the leadership of the working class over the basic construction of the country. All projects related to basic construction must have detailed designs in advance before construction can begin. This is a principle that must be followed, and a strict supervision and acceptance system must be implemented. We must eliminate all corruption, waste, and bureaucracy in state-owned enterprises, examine the thoughts and styles of leading cadres in state-owned enterprises, and highly promote the initiative and creativity of the masses of workers to further launch a large-scale nationwide campaign to increase production and practice economy.
    The people's democratic state led by the Chinese working class, as determined by specific historical conditions, is composed of a united front of four democratic classes. It is completely in line with the interests of our country and all the people for the Chinese working class to unite and lead the national bourgeoisie at the present stage to build a new democratic society and strive for the future realization of socialism. However, we must resolutely fight back against the bourgeoisie's frenzied attacks that violate the Common Program, attempt to undermine the leadership of the working class, and endanger the interests of the state and the people. We must inherit the glorious tradition of the Chinese working class's revolutionary struggle since "February 7th" for nearly thirty years, unite with the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, effectively defeat the bourgeoisie's attacks, achieve a thorough victory in the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy; and temper the ranks of the Chinese working class and the organization of the Chinese Communist Party into a steel-like strong force in this great struggle to ensure the realization of the long-term and highest interests of the Chinese people's revolution.

    打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻巩固工人阶级的领导权
    ——纪念“二七”二十九周年
    伟大的中国工人阶级在中国历史上所举行的第一次流血的革命斗争——京汉铁路工人的“二七”大罢工，到现在已经二十九周年了。从“二七”以来的近三十年间，中国工人阶级以中国共产党为代表，充分显示了它是中国人民的最先进、最革命的阶级。中国共产党领导全国人民，取得人民民主革命的伟大胜利，建立了中华人民共和国，广大的工人阶级群众在为争取革命战争的胜利和新民主主义社会的建设事业而进行的各种实际斗争中，发挥了先锋带头的领导作用和模范作用，这些又都充分证明了只有工人阶级才是我们国家的唯一的领导阶级。
    中国人民在中国工人阶级和中国共产党的领导之下，自建立中华人民共和国以来，进行了伟大的抗美援朝、土地改革和镇压反革命的运动，赢得了伟大的胜利，并在国防战线上、经济和财政战线上、文化和教育战线上取得了巨大的成就。中国工人阶级的领导和已得的胜利，不但使我们的国家和广大人民的利益有了最可靠的保障；而且使得参加我国人民民主统一战线的各个阶级的利益有了很大的发展。其中的一个明显的事实就是：中国民族资产阶级，三年来在工人阶级的领导下，解除了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的重重束缚，获得了他们在国民党反动统治的二十几年中所未有的空前的利益。
    中国民族资产阶级在新民主主义革命时期，只要承认并接受工人阶级的领导，遵守共同纲领，遵守人民政府的法令，承认并接受国营经济的领导，无论在政治上和经济上他们就都有充分的合法地位，能够发挥一定的作用，在他们合法经营的企业中也必然可以取得一定的利润，这是毫无疑问的。中国资产阶级在中华人民共和国成立以来，在必需品的生产、抗美援朝的捐献和纳税等方面，曾经作了相当的努力，这也是事实。但是，我们决不能忽视资产阶级在这三年以来向我们所举行的猖狂进攻。这个进攻就其性质来说，就是对于我们工人阶级领导权的直接进攻。资产阶级的剥削群众、不劳而食、损人利己、唯利是图、假公济私、投机取巧、铺张浪费、享乐至上等腐化堕落的思想和行为，正在到处侵蚀着我们工人阶级的队伍，侵蚀着国家机关及其工作人员，使我们的国家和人民的利益受到了不可计量的严重损失。这就是为什么我们必须大张旗鼓地、雷厉风行地、普遍深入地开展反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的理由。
    我们决不能容忍资产阶级对于工人阶级领导权的进攻。我们完全承认资产阶级在工商业方面的有利于国计民生的经营，是我国人民在现阶段所需要的；但是资产阶级经营方法的损人利己、损公利私、唯利是图的特性，却经常驱使他们要采取有害于国计民生的手段，经常驱使他们用资本主义生产的无政府状态和自由竞争，来抵抗、破坏与代替工人阶级和国营经济的领导与计划性。我们不能不看到资产阶级的思想本质的反动的一面。这种思想是以资产阶级所赖以生存的资本主义的私有财产制度为基础的。为了达到扩大私有财产的自私自利的目的，资产阶级往往不惜贪污、贿赂、盗窃、抢掠，无所顾忌地损害人民和国家的利益，以满足他们的腐化堕落的奢侈生活。事实证明，我国目前有一部分工商业者对于他们所已经得到的百分之十五以至于百分之三十的高额利润，还嫌不足；他们竟然要采取非法手段去博得百分之七八十甚至更高的利润。这完全是违反共同纲领的犯罪行为。共同纲领规定
    “对于扰乱市场的投机商业必须严格取缔”，而资产阶级中不法的工商业者追逐暴利的行为就使他们进行扰乱市场的投机行为。同样，共同纲领规定国民都有缴纳赋税的义务，而很多工商业者却千方百计地逃税漏税，有的地区逃税漏税达百分之二十到三十。共同纲领规定要“公私兼顾”“劳资两利”，而许多工商业者却处处损公利己，漠视工人阶级的利益，残酷压榨工人。共同纲领规定国家经济是整个社会经济的领导力量，而许多工商业者却不愿服从这种领导，他们对于国家的加工定货或则企图拒绝，或则偷工减料。共同纲领规定“爱护公共财物”为全体国民的公德之一，而许多工商业者竟不断盗窃国家财物，损害或破坏国家的建设工程。更严重的是他们还采取了“派进来”和“拉过去”的卑鄙方法，向国家机关和工作人员大举进攻。资产阶级三年来所做的这一切非法活动，没有不是直接危害着以工人阶级为领导的国家利益的。这不是直接对于工人阶级领导权的进攻又是什么呢？
    我们号召全国的工人阶级坚决起来，保卫和巩固工人阶级的领导权，打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻，为彻底实现改造旧社会和建设新社会的伟大目的而奋斗。这是一场激烈的阶级斗争，我们必须以工人阶级的革命的坚定性，英勇地来进行这一场伟大的战斗。所有国营、公营、公私合营和私营的企业中的全体职工和店员同志们，坚决地站在伟大、光荣的工人阶级的立场上，毫不动摇地参加到反贪污、反浪费和反官僚主义的斗争中去，无情地反对资产阶级的行贿、偷税漏税、盗骗国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报等的不法行为。我们要打破一切情面和顾虑，不为任何威胁利诱所屈服，大胆地、无保留地彻底揭发和检举一切不法分子的罪恶。我们的每一个人都是属于光荣的工人阶级的战士，决不能做资产阶级的俘虏；我们必须坚决地清除自己内部的一切贪污蜕化分子和内奸，巩固和纯洁我们的革命队伍。
    由于资产阶级思想的侵蚀，在我们工人阶级队伍中所造成的严重的贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象，必须引起我们的高度警惕，坚决予以彻底的肃清。在这一场激烈的阶级斗争中，必须百倍提高工人阶级的觉悟，和资产阶级的思想行为划清界限。我们决不要以为革命在全国范围的胜利，会使阶级斗争缓和；相反的，我们必须看到阶级斗争在新的条件下更加复杂的情况。对于资产阶级腐蚀和分化工人、破坏工会、侵蚀共产党和人民政府的恶毒阴谋，每一个忠诚的革命工作者尤其应该提起高度的警惕。某些工会干部被资产阶级所收买，变成出卖工人阶级利益的工贼，我们就一定要把他们清出工会的领导机关；某些工会的基层组织，被资产阶级所篡夺，变成维护资产阶级利益的工具，我们就一定要加以彻底的改组。在工人阶级组织内部，必须坚决克服右倾的危险，特别是要克服各级工会干部在执行政策上的右倾。有些工会干部在处理公私关系的时候，没有强调和坚持国家经济领导和先公后私的这个主要方面，而无原则地照顾和迁就私人资本家的利益；在处理劳资关系的时候，没有强调支持工人阶级的正当要求，而片面地强调发展生产的意义，结果只利于私人资本家，不利于职工群众。这些错误都必须加以纠正。在国营企业中，则必须坚决依靠工人，实行民主管理，彻底肃清资本主义的强制管理方法；实行技术服从政治、技术与群众相结合的方针，反对技术与群众分离和资产阶级的单纯技术观点；普遍深入地发动群众，加强工人阶级对于国家基本建设的领导。一切有关基本建设的工程，必须事先有周密的设计，然后才能施工，这是必须遵守的原则，并实行严格的监工和验收的制度。我们必须肃清国营企业中的一切贪污、浪费和官僚主义现象，检查国营企业领导干部的思想和作风，高度发扬工人群众的积极性和创造性，以便进一步开展一个普及全国的大规模的增产节约运动。
    中国工人阶级所领导的人民民主国家，为具体的历史条件所决定，是由四个民主阶级联合组成的。中国工人阶级在现阶段联合并领导民族资产阶级，为建设新民主主义社会并为将来实现社会主义而奋斗，这是完全符合于我们的国家和全体人民的利益的。但是，我们对于资产阶级违反共同纲领、企图破坏工人阶级的领导权、危害国家和人民利益的猖狂进攻，则必须予以坚决的还击。我们一定要继承中国工人阶级从“二七”以来近三十年革命斗争的光荣传统，在中国共产党的领导下，和全国人民在一起，有效地战胜资产阶级的进攻，取得反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义斗争的彻底胜利；并使中国工人阶级的队伍和中国共产党的组织，在这个伟大斗争中锻炼成为钢铁一般坚强的力量，以保证实现中国人民革命的长远的和最高的利益。
