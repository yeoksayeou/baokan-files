    The People's Government of the Twelfth District of Beijing Municipality
    Self-Criticism of Bureaucratic Work Style

    Editor,
    The criticism of us made by Comrade Cheng Xu, published on the "Readers' Letters" page of the People's Daily on January 16th, is basically correct. In addition to thanking Comrade Cheng Xu, we hereby make the following self-criticism.

    The work of the Fengtai Supply Station is indeed very important, but we have not paid enough attention to it. When the Fengtai Supply Station was formally established in May and June 1951, cadres were assigned from the existing strength of the District People's Government. At that time, the District People's Government itself already felt that there were not enough cadres, and coupled with our departmentalism and unwillingness to send stronger cadres to work at the supply station, the cadres at the supply station were not only extremely weak, but also extremely impure, and actually allowed counter-revolutionary element Hua Xianpeng (arrested during the cadre review last year) and embezzler Ma Jiaxi to remain. Deputy District Head Comrade Li Peishan, although concurrently served as the head of the supply station, rarely intervened in the work of the supply station, so that the work of the supply station was in a state of chaos for a long time, and corruption, waste, and dereliction of duty occurred. This shows that our bureaucratic work style is very serious. We have indeed made a big mistake. In this anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement, we have conducted a thorough examination. In addition to making a profound self-criticism, we have arrested and brought to justice the corrupt and derelict cadre Ma Jiaxi. At the same time, we have also educated other staff members well to ensure that the supply work of the supply station will be done well in the future.

### 北京市第十二区人民政府  对官僚主义作风的检讨

    北京市第十二区人民政府  
    对官僚主义作风的检讨
    编辑同志：一月十六日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表了程序同志对我们的批评，这个批评基本上是正确的。我们除向程序同志致谢之外，特作如下检讨。
    丰台补给站的工作，的确很重要，但我们却没有十分注意这个工作。一九五一年五、六月间，丰台补给站正式建立编制时，是从区人民政府现有的力量中配备干部的。当时区人民政府本身已经感到干部不够，加上我们有本位主义，不愿分出较强的干部去补给站工作，所以，补给站的干部不但极弱，而且极不纯洁，竟先后容留了反革命分子滑羡鹏（去年审干时被逮捕）、贪污分子马家僖。副区长李培山同志虽兼任补给站站长，但很少过问补给站的工作，以致补给站的工作长期陷于混乱状态，而且发生了贪污、浪费和失职等现象。这说明我们的官僚主义作风是十分严重的。我们确实是犯了很大的错误。在这次反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动中，我们已作了彻底检查。我们除了作深刻检讨外，已将贪污、失职的干部马家僖逮捕法办。同时，对其他工作人员，也很好地进行了教育，保证今后作好补给站的供给工作。
    北京市第十二区人民政府
