    The Central Academy of Drama's Spring Festival Performances Were Not Combined with the Current Struggle
    Editor: This Spring Festival (January 27th), the Beijing Labor People's Cultural Palace organized an art performance. The China Youth Art Theatre Acrobatic Troupe, the Central Academy of Drama Opera and Dance Theater, the Central Academy of Fine Arts Spring Festival Propaganda Team, and propaganda teams from several factories participated in the performance. Some programs were very popular with the masses, especially those programs that used opera, foreign films, folk art and other forms that the masses love to see, to promote the current anti-corruption struggle, which gave the audience a great education. However, the programs performed by the Central Academy of Drama, which has an important position in national drama education, were not closely combined with the current serious political struggle. They performed the Navy Dance, the Yao Dance, the Butterfly Catching Dance and other dances, and also performed the small opera "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland." These programs are of course performable, but in addition to this, there was not a single program reflecting the great struggle of the people of the whole country against the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks. This cannot but make people feel that the performance of the Central Academy of Drama is lagging behind the current struggle. Does such a serious struggle concerning the fate of the country not arouse the creative enthusiasm of drama workers? Even if you can't write a very complete work for a while, can't you perform one or two relatively simple programs that are more closely combined with the current struggle?

### 中央戏剧学院春节演出的节目没有和现实斗争结合

    中央戏剧学院春节演出的节目没有和现实斗争结合
    编辑同志：今年春节（一月二十七日），北京劳动人民文化宫组织了一个文艺演出会。青年艺术剧院杂技团、中央戏剧学院歌舞剧院、中央美术学院春节宣传队和若干工厂的宣传队参加演出。有些节目很受群众欢迎，尤其是利用群众所喜闻乐见的歌剧、洋片、曲艺等形式，宣传当前反贪污斗争的节目，给观众很大的教育。但是在全国戏剧教育方面有重要地位的中央戏剧学院，在这个会上演出的节目，却没有和当前严重的政治斗争密切结合。他们演出了海军舞、徭族舞、捕蝶舞等舞蹈，还演出了小型歌剧“兄妹开荒”，这些节目当然都是可以演出的，但除此以外，竟没有一个节目反映当前全国人民反对资产阶级猖狂进攻的伟大斗争，这不能不使人感到中央戏剧学院的演出，是落后于现实斗争的。难道这样一个有关国家命运的严重斗争，竟引不起戏剧工作者的创作热情吗？即使一时不能写出很完整的作品，难道也不能演出一两个比较简单、但和当前现实斗争结合较紧的节目吗？
