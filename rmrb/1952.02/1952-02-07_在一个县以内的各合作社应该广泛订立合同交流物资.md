    Cooperatives within a County Should Widely Establish Contracts to Exchange Materials

    Editor: In the past, Huailai County, Chahar Province, had many problems with the poor sales of local products and by-products, and the scope of material exchange was very small. Now, we have come up with a solution, which is to organize material exchange within the county. This method has solved many problems.

    Last December, the county cooperative convened a meeting of thirty grassroots cooperative directors. Everyone studied and discussed the method of carrying out material exchanges between grassroots cooperatives within the county. This found a way out for slow-selling products and solved the problem of daring to organize the masses of cooperative members to produce freely in the past due to the lack of sales to the outside. For example, Youzhou Village produces miscellaneous strips and asphalt, which had no sales to the outside in the past. At this meeting, the miscellaneous strips were sold to handicraft workers in Shizhuang Village to weave baskets and sieves, etc., and the asphalt was sold to the grassroots cooperatives in Tumu, Huailai, and Xiabaying to meet the needs of cooperative members and the masses for seed dressing materials. Shizhuangzi also established retail relationships with thirteen grassroots cooperatives including Beixinbao, so the cages and sieves produced by handicraft workers in this village also had sales. Xijiazhuang organized cooperative members to weave reed mats to supply four grassroots cooperatives including Jimingyi for promotion. The peanuts of the Xiyulin cooperative had no sales in the past, and this time they also established promotion contracts with seven cooperatives including Canfangying. In addition to the above-mentioned slow-selling products finding sales within the county, the grassroots cooperatives in various villages also signed a total of forty-nine material exchange contracts at this meeting, with a total value of goods of more than 40 million yuan. According to statistics: only through this material exchange, the income of cooperative members and the masses can be increased by more than 14,500 jin of rice; and 7,300 jin of intermediate exploitation can be reduced. We believe that expanding material exchange between grassroots cooperatives within the county is a good way to develop and promote supply and marketing business and is worthy of promotion.

    在一个县以内的各合作社应该广泛订立合同交流物资
    编辑同志：察哈尔省怀来县过去有不少土产和副产品销路不畅，物资交流的范围很小。现在想出一个办法，就是在本县内组织物资交流，这个办法也解决了不少问题。
    去年十二月县合作社召集三十个基层社主任开会，大家研究和讨论了在县内基层社之间互相开展物资交流的办法，给滞销的产品找到了出路，解决了过去因对外没销路，不敢放手组织社员群众生产的问题。如幽州村产杂条和柏油，过去对外没销路，在这次会上就把杂条销给施庄村手工业者编筐、编筛子等，又把柏油销给土木、怀来、下八营各基层社，满足了社员和群众对拌种原料的需要。施庄子又和北辛堡等十三个基层社建立了零销关系，因此这个村手工业者生产的笼驮、筛子也有了销路。席家庄组织社员编苇席供给鸡鸣驿等四个基层社推销。西榆林社的花生过去没销路，这次也和蚕房营等七个社建立了推销合同。除以上滞销产品在本县找到了销路外，各村的基层社在这次会上还签订了物资交流合同共四十九件，货物总值约有四千多万元。据统计：只通过这次物资交流，就可给社员群众增加收入合米一万四千五百多斤；减除了中间剥削七千三百斤。我们认为在本县范围以内，各基层社之间展开物资交流，是开展和推进供销业务的好办法，是值得推广的。
