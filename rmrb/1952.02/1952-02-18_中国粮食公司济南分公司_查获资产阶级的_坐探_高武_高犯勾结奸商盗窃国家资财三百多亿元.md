    China Grain Company Jinan Branch
    Uncovers Class Enemy "Mole" Gao Wu
    Gao Colludes with Unscrupulous Merchants to Steal Over 30 Billion Yuan in State Assets
    The China Grain Company Jinan Branch recently uncovered a major case of Gao Wu, a "mole" of the bourgeoisie, who for three years abused his power to steal state economic intelligence, engage in malfeasance, and caused huge political and economic losses to state economic organs. According to incomplete statistics, Gao embezzled more than 500 million yuan in this case. In the entrusted processing of flour, he colluded with private merchants, cut corners, and embezzled state grain, resulting in a loss of over 32 billion yuan in state assets.
    Gao Wu was originally a flour merchant. Not long after liberation (October 1948), Gao infiltrated state economic organs and served as a business clerk in the China Grain Company Jinan Branch, specifically responsible for flour processing and concurrently handling business operations. During his tenure, Gao used his position in managing processing to steal economic intelligence and collude with private merchants to steal large amounts of state assets. According to Gao's confession, before Gao infiltrated state organs, the unscrupulous merchants in the Jinan flour industry actively sought a job for Gao. After Gao entered the Grain Company, the unscrupulous merchants told Gao, "You have to help us now that you are in the Grain Company." After that, the unscrupulous merchants bribed Gao extensively. For example, Baofeng Flour Mill paid bribes of over 150 million yuan in the two years of 1949 and 1950; Huifeng Flour Mill paid a total of over 90 million yuan in two years; other flour mills such as Huaqing, Chengji, and Chengfeng all bribed Gao with over 70 million yuan. In addition, various flour mills gave Gao shares in the name of deposits. The unscrupulous merchants of various flour mills also bribed a large number of cadres through Gao, this "mole", in order to steal state assets smoothly. After Gao bribed the cadres who were related to him, he more blatantly colluded with unscrupulous merchants to steal state economic intelligence and defraud state assets. Before the Shandong Province processing conference in 1950, unscrupulous merchants such as Yu Guanwu secretly gathered with Gao Wu to spread economic intelligence. At the processing conference, the unscrupulous merchants openly confronted the Grain Company. After that, Gao Wu often secretly told those unscrupulous flour merchants about the processing tasks, enabling them to resist processing tasks in an organized and planned manner. In flour processing, Gao openly gave private merchants excessive profits, reducing the flour yield rate in the processing contracts by five to seven catties per hundred catties. In the past three years, the Grain Company entrusted the processing of 200 million catties of wheat, resulting in a total loss of over 13.5 billion yuan. The unscrupulous merchants increased the moisture content, adulterated the flour, and reduced the weight of the flour they delivered, causing the Grain Company to suffer losses of approximately 7 billion yuan. In addition, five flour mills, including Huifeng, embezzled public wheat and made huge profits of over 10 billion yuan.
    Gao also colluded with private merchants in the state's grain procurement, deliberately raising prices for external transfers, and then buying back at high prices from the merchants, working for the unscrupulous merchants and causing economic losses to the state. In February 1949, a certain place sold 200 bags of soybeans (approximately 40,000 catties) to the Grain Company. Gao Wu, Gong Guichen, and others, under the pretext that the quality of the soybeans was not good, did not buy them, but allowed the unscrupulous merchant Yu Xiuwen to buy them at a lower price and then sell them to the Grain Company at a higher price. In the same year, Wang Handong of Yucheng Freight Station had 30 tons of wheat and requested to sell it to the Grain Company, but Gao Wu and others refused to buy it under the pretext that the quality was not good, and introduced it to the unscrupulous merchant Yu Xiuwen. Yu Xiuwen then sold it to the Grain Company at a higher price. In 1949, when prices were unstable, the Grain Company restricted the sale of flour, but Gao Wu, using the "authority" of the salesman, indefinitely allocated a large amount of flour to the unscrupulous merchant Yu Xiuwen, allowing the unscrupulous merchant Yu Xiuwen to manipulate the market.
    After the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement began, all of Gao's crimes were exposed. The Jinan Municipal People's Court accepted the accusation of the China Grain Company Jinan Branch and arrested Gao and punished him according to law. (Jinan Dazhong Daily)

    中国粮食公司济南分公司
    查获资产阶级的“坐探”高武
    高犯勾结奸商盗窃国家资财三百多亿元
    中国粮食公司济南分公司最近破获了资产阶级的“坐探”高武三年来利用职权盗窃国家经济情报，营私舞弊，使国家经济机关在政治上、经济上受到巨大损失的巨案。据不完全的统计，在这一案件中高犯贪污在五亿元以上，在面粉委托加工中，和私商勾结，偷工减料，盗用国家粮食而造成的国家资财的损失达三百二十多亿元。
    高武原是面粉业商人。解放不久（一九四八年十月）高犯就钻入国家经济机关，在中国粮食公司济南分公司任业务科员，专门负责面粉加工和兼办经营业务。高犯在任职期间，借经营加工的职权，盗窃经济情报，勾结私商，大量盗窃国家资财。据高犯自供，当高犯未钻入国家机关前，济南面粉业奸商们曾积极地给高犯找职业。高犯进入粮食公司后，奸商们对高犯说：“你到了粮食公司，可要给我们帮忙了。”此后，奸商们就大量地向高武行贿。如宝丰面粉厂在一九四九、一九五○年两年中，行贿款即达一亿五千多万元；惠丰面粉厂，两年共行贿九千多万元；其他华庆、成记、成丰等面粉厂向高武行贿的，都在七千万元以上。此外，各个面粉厂又以存款为名，给高武入股。各面粉厂奸商们又通过高武这个“坐探”，大量地向干部行贿，以顺心应手地盗窃国家资财。当高武在贿赂了和他有关系的干部之后，更明目张胆地勾通奸商，盗窃国家经济情报，盗骗国家资财。在一九五○年山东省加工会议之前，奸商俞冠五等就和高武秘密集会，传播经济情报，在加工会议上奸商们公然对抗粮食公司。此后，高武经常把加工任务密告那些面粉奸商，使他们有组织有计划地抗拒加工任务。在面粉加工中，高武公开地给私商们暴利，在订立加工合同时，减低交粉率，每百斤相差五斤到七斤。三年来，粮食公司共委托加工小麦两亿斤，共计损失一百三十五亿元以上。奸商们在所交的面粉中，增加水分、掺杂，减少分量，使粮食公司遭到的损失约七十亿元左右。此外，惠丰等五个面粉厂，盗用公家小麦，从中获取暴利约一百亿元以上。
    高犯还在给国家收购粮食中，勾结私商，故意抬高价格向外转让，又用高价从商人手中买回，为奸商效力，而使国家经济受到损失。在一九四九年二月间，有某处向粮食公司出售元豆二百包（约四万斤），高武、宫桂臣等，藉口元豆质量不好不买，而让奸商于秀文压价买下，再用高价卖给粮食公司；同年，裕成货栈王汉东有小麦三十吨，要求卖给粮食公司，而高武等则推辞质量不好不买，而介绍卖给奸商于秀文。于秀文再以高价卖给粮食公司。在一九四九年物价不稳时，粮食公司限制出售面粉，而高武借营业员的“职权”，无限度地把大批面粉批给奸商于秀文，纵使奸商于秀文操纵市场。
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动开始后，高犯的罪行全部被揭发出来。济南市人民法院接受中国粮食公司济南分公司的控告，已将高犯逮捕依法惩办。　　　（济南大众日报）
