    Learning from the Heroic Examples of the Soviet Army
    Zhang Ming, Combat Hero of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    February 14th is the historically significant date of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. The Chinese people are celebrating this day with unparalleled joy, celebrating the unprecedented consolidation and development of the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples over the past two years.
    In the winter before last, I, as a young representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, went to the Soviet Union with our Chinese youth delegation. During my three and a half months in the Soviet Union, I deeply felt that the Soviet Union is an incredibly happy and powerful country, and the Soviet socialist system is an incomparably superior social system. I visited the massive project of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station, the famous Donbass mines, and the wealthiest collective farms in Ukraine. Especially when I saw the heroic city of Stalingrad, rebuilt after the war, I thought: The heroic Soviet people have not only withstood the test of the war against German fascism, but also, after suffering significant sacrifices and destruction, have restored the wounds of war in a short period of time, building their country even more beautiful and prosperous than before. This fact fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system and the creative labor of the Soviet people.
    During my visit to the Soviet Union, I met many Soviet heroes with chests full of medals and saw outstanding combat heroes like "A Real Man" Maresyev. After many visits, my overall impression was: The Soviet army is the most powerful and invincible army in the world. It was this army that crushed the German fascist hordes, helped us defeat Japanese imperialism, and defended human peace. When I visited the heroic Stalingrad, I was deeply moved by the unparalleled heroic deeds created by the Soviet army to defend the city of Stalingrad, which I saw in the museum's exhibits. Only those who have personally experienced war can appreciate the perilous situation at that time when the Soviet Union fought alone against a brutal enemy, and can appreciate how great the Soviet heroes were who finally defeated the enemy! I simply cannot describe my admiration for the Soviet army.
    We visited many factories, farms, and schools in the Soviet Union, and we met many labor heroes. They tirelessly and repeatedly introduced us to the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union. They always said: "We are willing to introduce the experience of more than 30 years of socialist construction under the leadership of Comrades Lenin and Stalin to the people of the new China without reservation, so that China can rapidly move from a new democratic society to a socialist society and toward a communist society."
    What I cannot forget the most is when visiting a machine manufacturing factory, the factory was rushing to produce our Chinese orders. The factory director told us: "When they heard that these machines were being made for the new China, the workers were extremely happy. Why? Because China has not only defeated the running dog of American imperialism, Chiang Kai-shek, but is now also standing at the forefront of the struggle to defend world peace, fighting alongside the Korean people against the American aggressors. The workers said: 'We are now not only speeding up production to deliver them to China as soon as possible, but we are also preparing to select the most technically excellent Youth League members to apply to help Chinese workers master these machines.'" These words have been deeply imprinted in my mind.
    Today, as we celebrate the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, our great motherland is engaged in a vigorous movement to resist America and aid Korea, and the Chinese People's Volunteers are fighting against the American aggressors and their accomplice armies on the Korean battlefield. Therefore, we especially need to learn from the heroic examples of the Soviet army, learn from the advanced military science and technology of the Soviet army, as well as its high degree of discipline, patriotism, and internationalism, to strengthen our national defense forces. I firmly believe that as long as we learn better from the Soviet Union and from the Soviet army, we will definitely be able to quickly build a fully regularized and modernized national defense army. In order to defend our motherland, completely defeat the war conspiracies of the imperialist aggressors, and defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world, we must do so.

    学习苏联军队的英雄榜样
    中国人民解放军某部战斗英雄  张明
    二月十四日是签订中苏友好同盟互助条约的具有历史意义的日子，中国人民以无比愉快的心情来庆祝这个日子，庆祝两年来中苏两国人民兄弟般友谊的空前的巩固和发展。
    前年的冬天，我，作为中国人民解放军的一个青年代表，随着我们中国的访苏青年代表团到了苏联。在苏联逗留的三个半月中，我深深地感到苏联是一个无比幸福而强大的国家，苏联的社会主义制度是无比优越的社会制度。我参观了第聂泊水电站的巨大工程，参观了有名的顿巴斯的矿场，也参观了乌克兰的最富裕的集体农庄，特别是当我看到战后从新建立起来的英雄的斯大林格勒城的时候，我就想：英雄的苏联人民不仅经历了对德国法西斯的战争的考验，而且在遭受了重大牺牲和破坏后，在短短的时间内恢复了战争的创伤，把自己的国家建设得比以前更加美丽和更加富强了，这事实充分显示了社会主义制度的优越性和苏联人民的创造劳动。
    在访苏期间，我遇见了许多胸前挂满勋章的苏联英雄，看到了像“真正的人”马列西也夫那样的杰出的战斗英雄。经过许多访问后，我得到的总的印象是：苏联军队是世界上最强大无敌的军队。正是这支军队粉碎了德国法西斯兽军，帮助我们打败了日本帝国主义，捍卫了人类和平。当我参观英雄的斯大林格勒时，从博物馆的陈列品里，我看到苏联军队为保卫斯大林格勒城所创造的无比的英雄事迹而深深感动。只有亲身经历过战争的人，才能体会到当时苏联单独地和凶残的敌人作战的危急情况，才能体会到而终于战胜敌人的苏军英雄们是如何的伟大！我简直无法形容我对苏联军队的敬佩。
    我们在苏联参观了许多工厂、农场和学校，我们碰见了许多劳动英雄。他们都是不厌其烦地给我们反复介绍苏联的先进生产经验。他们总是这样地说：“我们愿意把列宁、斯大林同志领导下三十多年社会主义建设的经验毫不保留地介绍给新中国人民，使中国由新民主主义社会迅速地走向社会主义社会，走向共产主义社会。”
    我最不能忘记的是当参观一个机器制造厂时，那个工厂正在赶制我们中国的定货，厂长同志告诉我们说：“当听到这些机器是给新中国制造的时候，工人同志们都无比的高兴。为什么呢？因为中国不仅打败了美帝国主义的走狗蒋介石，而且现在又站在保卫世界和平的斗争的最前线，和朝鲜人民并肩打击着美国侵略者。工人们说：‘我们现在不仅在加紧赶制，好早些送到中国；而且还准备挑选在技术上最优秀的青年团员应聘去帮助中国工人掌握这些机器。’”这些话一直深深地印在我的心里。
    今天，我们在庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订两周年纪念日的时候，我们伟大的祖国正在进行着轰轰烈烈的抗美援朝运动，中国人民志愿军正在朝鲜战场上打击着美国侵略者及其帮凶军队。因此，我们特别需要学习苏联军队的英雄榜样，学习苏联军队的先进的军事科学技术及其高度的纪律性、爱国主义和国际主义的精神，来加强我们国防力量。我坚决相信：只要我们更好地向苏联学习，向苏联军队学习，我们一定能够迅速建设一支完全正规化、现代化的国防军。为了保卫我们的祖国，彻底击败帝国主义侵略者的战争阴谋，保卫远东及世界持久和平，我们一定要这样做。
