    CPC Henan Province, Shangcai County Committee Secretary
    Li Rusheng Should Make a Self-Criticism for Obstructing Inspection Work

    To the Editor: Last year, we went to Shangcai County, Henan Province, to inspect local financial work. At a meeting of the Local Finance Consolidation Committee, Wang, the head of the Shangcai County Finance Section, reported on some instances of Shangcai County violating financial regulations and being extravagant and wasteful, such as over-reimbursing meeting expenses, converting surplus grain into money for speculative business, and demolishing old houses to build new-style buildings. After the meeting, County Party Secretary Li Rusheng flew into a rage, questioning Wang, the head of the Finance Section: "What nonsense are you talking about at the meeting? It's simply a lack of organization and discipline. The district is responsible for district matters, and county matters should be considered carefully before being said!" These words frightened Wang, the head of the Finance Section, to the point where he dared not speak again.

    I believe that Li Rusheng should make a public self-criticism for this erroneous attitude of obstructing inspection work.

    Wang Bingwu, Finance Section, Xinyang Special Prefecture, Henan Province

    中共河南省上蔡县县委书记
    李汝生阻碍检查工作应作检讨
    编辑同志：去年我们到河南省上蔡县检查地方财政工作。上蔡县财政科王科长在地方财政整理委员会议上报告了一些关于上蔡县违反财政制度、铺张浪费的事情，如多报销会议费，把多余的粮食折成钱做投机生意，拆毁旧房盖造新式大楼等。会后，县委书记李汝生就大发脾气，责问财政科王科长：“你在会议上胡说什么？简直无组织无纪律。区里的事，区里负责，县里的事，应该考虑考虑再说！”这些话吓得王科长再也不敢发言了。
    我认为，李汝生对这种阻碍检查工作的错误态度，应作公开检讨。
