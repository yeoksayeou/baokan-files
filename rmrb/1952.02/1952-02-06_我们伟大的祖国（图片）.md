    This is the first floating dock built by our country. It was created by the workers of the Shanghai Shipbuilding and Repair Factory, who brought their wisdom and creativity into play, using old materials. The dock is 71.93 meters long, 18.29 meters wide, and 8.53 meters high, and can be towed to various locations for use. This is a picture of a ship being repaired in the dock.
