Economic Briefs

    ▲ The forest timber reserves in the Southwest region rank second in the country. Before liberation, these forests suffered from years of deforestation. After liberation, the People's Government, on the one hand, restored the original forest areas, and on the other hand, mobilized the people to plant trees. In the first half of last year, the people in the Southwest region afforested 640,000 mu. Yunnan Province planted 1.94 million trees last June, exceeding the total number of trees planted in the more than 20 years before liberation. Forest protection organizations have been generally established in various parts of the Southwest, and mass forest protection campaigns have been launched. According to statistics, there are now more than 10,000 forest protection teams in the Southwest region. Under the protection of these forest protection teams, the phenomenon of indiscriminate logging has been greatly reduced compared with the past. In order to further plant trees and eliminate barren hills, the Southwest region collected 1.15 million catties of tree seeds in the autumn and winter of last year. This spring, the Southwest region will vigorously promote the method of cooperative afforestation and mobilize farmers to widely organize afforestation cooperatives to welcome the upcoming spring afforestation campaign.
    ▲ Last winter and this spring, the labor force in the rural areas of Northeast China participating in sideline production has greatly exceeded that of previous years. Many villages and settlements have achieved "every household has production, no household has idle people." In Taonan and Zhanyu counties of Heilongjiang Province, more than 90% of the male and female labor force participated in sideline production, an increase of 30% to 40% compared with previous years. Moreover, the vast majority of the labor force participating in sideline production in various places participated in mutual aid groups, changing the phenomenon that "winter organization could not be formed" in previous years. According to incomplete statistics from 30 counties in Heilongjiang, Rehe, and Jilin provinces, the total value of sideline production income before the year has reached more than 740 billion yuan, equivalent to 1.1 million tons of grain. Such a large amount of sideline production income will play a significant role in this year's agricultural production.
    ▲ According to statistics from the Salt Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, the national table salt production from January to October last year exceeded the original annual production plan by 30.58%, equivalent to 171.56% of the actual production in 1950, exceeding the output of any year during the Kuomintang reactionary rule. Over the past year, salt workers in various salt-producing areas have generally launched patriotic production increase campaigns, and the political awareness of workers has been greatly improved, and labor productivity has increased by 30% to more than 100% compared with 1950. The quality of table salt produced in various regions has also improved significantly, and generally meets the standards; the highest quality contains 98.5% sodium chloride, breaking historical records and exceeding the standard of salt produced in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean by 2.5%.
    ▲ Pu'er tea, produced in the ethnic minority areas of Cheli, Fo Hai, and Nanqiao counties in Pu'er Prefecture, Yunnan Province, has a strong flavor and bright color, with an annual output of about 80,000 dan. In the more than ten years before liberation, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Pu'er tea production gradually shrank, and the lives of dozens of ethnic minority tea farmers, such as the Bo, Akha, Puman, and Biyue, who depended on tea cultivation for their livelihoods, were extremely miserable. After liberation, the People's Government allocated a large amount of special funds to purchase Pu'er tea and provided loans to tea farmers or tea merchants in the form of pre-purchases. The Fo Hai State-owned Trading Company helped tea farmers organize production cooperatives; the Yunnan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry sent technicians to Fo Hai to guide tea farmers in production. These measures greatly increased the production enthusiasm of tea farmers of all ethnic groups. Tens of thousands of tea farmers have removed the weeds that have grown in the tea gardens for many years and stepped up intertillage and fertilization.
    ▲ Alxa League in Ningxia Province is an area where the Mongolian people live, and it is a natural large pasture with an area of about 150,000 square kilometers. The camel hair produced here is of good quality, with fine, long, and downy hair. The annual output is more than one million catties at its peak, and the quantity and quality are the best in the country. Before liberation, the Alxa League's camel hair market was monopolized by bandit leader Hong Kui, and predatory unequal exchanges caused camel hair production to decrease day by day. After liberation, the state-owned trading department correctly implemented a reasonable price policy, organized trade teams and mobilized private merchants to go deep into the Bage (administrative unit, slightly larger than a township in agricultural areas) to purchase camel hair, and supplied herders with various daily necessities. The sales channels for Alxa League's camel hair were completely opened up, and the economy of Alxa League also prospered. The enthusiasm of herders for production has increased, and the number of camels in the entire league has increased by a quarter compared with before liberation.

    经济简讯
    ▲西南区森林的木材蓄积量占全国第二位。解放前，这些森林都遭受过多年的滥伐。解放后人民政府一面恢复原有的林区，一面发动人民群众植树造林。去年上半年，西南全区人民造林达六十四万亩。云南省去年六月植树一百九十四万株，超过解放前二十多年的植树总和。西南各地普遍成立了护林组织，开展了群众性的护林运动。据统计：现在西南全区共有一万多个护林小组。在这些护林小组的保护下，乱伐林木的现象较前大为减少。为进一步植树造林消灭荒山，去年秋、冬两季，西南全区已采集树种一百一十五万斤。今年春季，西南各地将大力推广合作造林的办法，发动农民广泛组织造林合作社，迎接行将到来的春季造林运动。
    ▲去冬今春东北农村参加副业生产的劳动力大大超过了往年，许多村屯都做到了“家家有生产、户户无闲人”。黑龙江省洮南、瞻榆等县，百分之九十以上的男女劳动力都参加了副业生产，人数较往年增加百分之三十到百分之四十。而且各地参加副业生产的劳动力绝大部分都参加了互助组，改变了往年“冬季组织不起来”的现象。据黑龙江、热河、吉林三省三十个县的不完全统计：年前副业生产收入的总值已达七千四百多亿元，折合粮食一百一十万吨。副业生产收入这样大，对今年的农业生产将起很大的作用。
    ▲据中央人民政府财政部盐务总局统计，去年一月到十月全国食盐产量，已超过原订全年生产计划百分之三十点五八，等于一九五○年实产量百分之一百七十一点五六，超过国民党反动统治时期任何一年的产量。一年来各产盐区盐工普遍开展了爱国增产运动，工人政治觉悟大大提高，劳动生产率比一九五零年提高百分之三十到一倍以上。各地区出产的食盐质量也显著提高，一般都够得上标准；质量最高的含氯化钠百分之九十八点五，打破了历史纪录，并超过红海和地中海出产的盐的标准百分之二点五。
    ▲我国云南普洱专区的车里、佛海、南峤等县的少数民族地区出产的普洱茶，味浓色艳，年产量约有八万担。解放前十多年中，在国民党反动统治下，普洱茶叶生产逐年萎缩，靠种茶为生的僰、阿卡、蒲满、碧约等几十种少数民族茶农生活极为悲惨。解放后，人民政府拨了大批专款收购普洱茶，并以预购方式贷款给茶农或茶商。佛海国营贸易公司帮助茶农组织生产合作社；云南省人民政府农林厅派技术人员到佛海指导茶农生产。这些措施使各民族茶农的生产情绪大为提高。数万茶农都铲除茶园里蔓生多年的杂草，加紧中耕施肥。
    ▲宁夏省阿拉善旗是蒙古民族人民聚居的地区，是一片天然的大牧场，面积约十五万平方公里。这里出产的驼毛，品质很好，毛细长而多绒，年产量最高时有一百多万斤，数量、质量都是全国第一。解放前，阿拉善旗的驼毛市场受到马匪鸿逵的垄断，掠夺性的不等价交换，使驼毛产量一天天减少。解放后，国营贸易部门正确执行了合理的价格政策，并组织贸易小组和发动私商深入巴格（行政单位，比农业地区一个乡稍大）收购驼毛，同时供应牧民各种日用必需品。阿拉善旗驼毛的销路就此完全打开，阿拉善旗的经济也跟着繁荣起来。牧民生产积极性提高了，现在全旗的骆驼已比解放前增加四分之一。
