At the Anti-Corruption, Anti-Waste, and Anti-Bureaucracy Exhibition held in Tianjin, various weapons used by the bourgeoisie in their frantic attacks on the people are on display.

Part of these weapons consists of gold, US dollars, jewelry, colorful clothing and utensils, opium, American nude paintings, and Chinese "Hundred Beauties" pictures, various fake accounts for tax evasion, secrets for shoddy workmanship and cutting corners, and tricks to lure cadres. Behind each item lies insidious cunning and greedy shameless ambition.

When contractor Bian Xianchen attacked Wang Zhongda, a technician at the North China Textile Administration Bureau, he first learned that Wang Zhongda had a history of opium addiction. So, taking advantage of Wang Zhongda's late-night supervision of construction and mental exhaustion, he arranged for someone to smoke opium next to Wang Zhongda, gradually arousing Wang Zhongda's addiction. Then, he supplied Wang Zhongda with large quantities of opium. At this point, Wang Zhongda lost control of himself. The unscrupulous merchants then freely cut corners in construction and stole large quantities of national construction materials. Now, Wang Zhongda has confessed his mistakes and escaped the trap of the unscrupulous merchants. At the exhibition, he uses his own personal experience to introduce the crimes of the unscrupulous merchants to the audience.

The exhibits show that the Tianjin branches of major corporations under the Central Trade Department, such as the Import and Export Corporation, the Department Store Corporation, the Oils and Fats Corporation, and the Animal Products Corporation, are the concentrated targets of the unscrupulous merchants. They attacked from the outside and sent people inside as internal collaborators. Each company had its own spies, some of whom even controlled important businesses. These companies had many breaches; the bourgeoisie inserted many blood-sucking tubes, greedily sucking the blood of the people. Fu Jizheng, the chief of the Department Store Section of the Tianjin Branch of the Import and Export Corporation, was a spy sent in by the bourgeoisie. He stole the company's quarterly procurement plan and sent it to the private Xinchang Trading Company. The Xinchang Trading Company then purchased a large quantity of goods based on the plan and stored them in Hong Kong. When Fu Jizheng said the company needed something, they would provide it. In this way, they colluded internally and externally, illegally stealing about 800 million yuan of state property. Wang Deling, the secretary of the Barter Room of the Tianjin Branch of the Import and Export Corporation, was an unscrupulous merchant who had infiltrated the company. He worked in the company during the day and went to his own China Hardware Store to guide business at night. Because he was able to freely steal the company's business secrets and use the company's various conveniences, his hardware store's capital rapidly developed from several million yuan to 400-500 million yuan. Yonghua Trading Company, which was on good terms with him, also made a fortune. In a glass cabinet, the gold and US dollars that the imperialist element, Swiss unscrupulous merchant, and manager of Yutai Foreign Firm, Max Schlaepfer, used to bribe Xu Mengde, the chief of the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Section of the Tianjin Branch of the Import and Export Corporation, are on display. The bribes alone amounted to more than 300 million yuan in RMB.

The exhibition displays the various tax evasion methods and false accounts of the illegal capitalists. Their tax evasion methods include: shopkeepers protecting traveling merchants, creating false accounts, falsely reporting sales costs, underreporting business income, and hiding large amounts of funds off the books, totaling eighteen types. Yang Jian'an, the manager of Huayang Tobacco Company and a major unscrupulous merchant, alone evaded 2.3 billion yuan in taxes. Here are the false accounts kept in English by a certain capitalist. There is an old almanac used by the unscrupulous merchant Liu Yinxuan to record false accounts in code. There is a tattered old-style medicine book used by Deshunhe Pharmacy to record "internal accounts." Lichang Hardware Store privately carved sixty-five fake seals to create false accounts for tax evasion. A thick, hollowed-out sugarcane is the tool used by the unscrupulous merchant Zhang Qinghua to smuggle forty-one watches for tax evasion. Many unscrupulous smuggling and tax evasion activities of merchants have been repeatedly discovered by the tax bureau. But they are always unwilling to lay down their weapons. Zhang Jingheng, the manager of Huafeng Paper Store and an unscrupulous merchant, has written twenty-one guarantees to the tax bureau, each time writing lies such as "I guarantee that I will never commit the same mistake again in the future," but he is always unwilling to fully confess his tax evasion activities. How harmful is the tax evasion of illegal industrialists and businessmen in Tianjin to the country? According to a survey by the Tianjin Tax Bureau, in the three years since liberation, the amount of tax evaded by private industrialists and businessmen in the city reached 800 billion yuan. This money is equivalent to the value of five hundred and fifty-three fighter planes; it could build eight 30,000-spindle yarn factories. According to a survey of private industrial and commercial tax sources in Tianjin in the second half of 1951 by the Tianjin Tax Bureau, 82 percent of the 1,807 households surveyed, totaling 1,490 households, evaded taxes.

The exhibits point out that many illegal capitalists are extremely unscrupulous in their behavior of cutting corners, using inferior goods to replace good ones, destroying production, and stealing state property when processing orders for the state or trading with state-owned economic departments. Here are displayed various inferior and substandard products they manufactured, from military raincoats to large quantities of produced cloth, and even necessities that people eat, wear, and use every day. Many of these shoddy products are simply unusable. When unscrupulous merchants Qiao Mingxun, Li Bingjia, and others were contracted to produce military processing raincoats, they replaced good cloth with inferior cloth and used less glue and gasoline, resulting in transparent and leaky raincoats. To pass the light inspection, they applied a layer of black smoke inside the rubber cloth. This batch of goods caused the state to suffer a loss of 12.5 billion yuan. More than 600 private yarn factories in Tianjin are processing production for the state-owned Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company of Tianjin, and it has now been discovered that most of them are cutting corners. They adulterate bad cotton when spinning yarn and adulterate bad yarn when weaving cloth. When weaving a piece of cloth, they can use several or even more than sixty fewer warp threads. From March 1950 to December 1951, two larger private yarn factories illegally stole 5 billion yuan of state property by using the above methods in processing. Zhenhua, Guohua, Jianhua, Yongming, and other wire factories used good copper wire at both ends of the wire, but bad copper wire in the middle when contracted to produce large quantities of processing and ordering for the state; they used white cloth coated with ink instead of coated insulating cloth; they used foul oil instead of asphalt; they used bad paraffin instead of good paraffin; they used insulating rubber skin at both ends and white cloth in the middle. Their secrets include "Ten Major Steals" and "Eight Major Steals." In the end, the dimensions were not even correct at the time of delivery. A wire that was stolen from head to toe, inside and out, became a defective product. When used, it is very easy to leak electricity, catch fire, and cause disasters. Displayed here are various products made by illegal capitalists using theft tactics: a new bed sheet with bright and fresh colors loses its distinction between red and green and becomes blurred after one wash; a pair of sneakers can only be worn for ten and a half days. The China Industrial Equipment Company bought 7 billion yuan of lampblack through Jingyuan and Donghua Trading Company, which was used to make ink, but it could not print words because the lampblack was fake. Ni Hongen, a corrupt element of the North China Branch of the China Petroleum Company, colluded with the unscrupulous merchant Song Zijia and bought 2 billion yuan of fake butter for the company, which would cause the machine to catch fire when used to lubricate it. In order to seize huge profits, the unscrupulous merchants did not hesitate to put the people in the midst of water and fire! The people of the whole country regard resisting US aggression and aiding Korea as a sacred cause, but the private Lixing Egg Factory heartlessly stole the rations of the Chinese People's Volunteers. In July of last year, the Lixing Egg Factory acted as an agent for processing 800,000 catties of egg powder to support the Chinese People's Volunteers, and they actually put one to three and a half taels less in each can (one catty).

What is exhibited here is only a small part of the evil deeds and crimes of the illegal capitalists. Every conscientious and patriotic Chinese should think: How should we treat these hateful traitors!

    在天津市反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义展览会看到的不法资本家的罪行
    林沫
    在天津市举办的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的展览会中，陈列着资产阶级向人民疯狂进攻的各种各样的武器。
    这些武器的一部分，就是黄金、美钞、珠宝玉器，五光十色的衣服和用具，鸦片，美国的裸体画和中国的“百美图”，各式各样偷税的假账，偷工减料的秘诀，引诱干部的法术。在每种东西后面，都隐藏着阴险狡诈和贪婪无耻的野心。
    营造商边献臣向华北纺织管理局技师王仲达进攻的时候，事先探知王仲达曾经有过抽鸦片的嗜好，于是乘王仲达监工到深夜、精神疲倦的时候，布置专人在王仲达旁边抽鸦片，一步一步地勾起王仲达的烟瘾，随后就大批供给王仲达鸦片。这时王仲达就身不由己了。奸商们于是放手地在施工中偷工减料，并把国家的大批建筑材料偷走。现在，王仲达坦白了自己的错误，逃出了奸商的陷阱。在展览会中，他以自己的亲身经验，向观众介绍奸商的罪行。
    展览会的陈列品说明：中央贸易部所属各大公司在天津的分公司如进出口公司、百货公司、油脂公司、畜产公司等，是奸商们集中进攻的目标。他们一面从外面围攻，一面派人打进去做内应。各公司里都有他们的奸细，有的并掌管了重要业务。这些公司被打开了很多缺口；资产阶级插进了很多吸血管，大量地吮吸人民的血。进出口公司天津分公司百货科科长傅继柽是资产阶级派进来的奸细，他把公司一个季度的采购计划偷去送给私营鑫昌贸易行。鑫昌贸易行就根据计划购买大批货物，放在香港，傅继柽说公司要什么，他们就来什么。这样内呼外应，非法盗窃国家财产约八亿元。进出口公司天津分公司易货室秘书王德苓是个打进来的奸商，他白天在公司办公，夜晚就到自己开办的中国五金行指导业务。由于他能自由地盗窃公司的商情机密，利用公司的各种方便，他的五金行的资本由几百万元迅速发展到四、五亿元。和他相好的永华贸易行也发了大财。在一个玻璃柜里，陈列着帝国主义分子、瑞士籍奸商裕泰洋行经理麦士霖收买进出口公司天津分公司化工医药科科长徐孟德的黄金和美钞。单这一部分行贿的赃款，就合人民币三亿多元。
    展览会中陈列着不法资本家们各种各样的偷税方法和假账。他们偷税的方法有：座商包庇行商、造假户头、假报销货成本、少报营业额、大批资金逃在账外等共十八种。仅华阳烟草公司经理、大奸商杨健庵一人就偷税二十三亿元。这里有某资本家用英文记的假账。有奸商刘荫轩用暗码记假账用的破旧的历书。有德顺和药铺记“内账”用的残破的旧式药书。利昌五金行为立假户头偷税，前后曾私刻了六十五块假图章。有一段粗粗的被挖空了的甘蔗，是奸商张庆华装着四十一只手表进行走私逃税的工具。许多奸商卑鄙的走私、偷税行为，曾一再被税务局查出。但他们始终不肯放下自己的武器。华丰纸行经理、奸商张景珩曾先后向税务局写过二十一次具结书，每次都写着：“保证今后决不再犯”一类的鬼话，但始终不肯把全部偷税行为交代清楚。天津不法工商业者的偷税行为对国家的危害有多大呢？根据天津市税务局的调查，解放三年来全市私营工商业者偷税款额达到八千亿元。这些钱相当于五百五十三架战斗机的价值；可以建设八个三万锭子的纱厂。据天津市税务局一九五一年下半年私营工商业税源调查，在被调查的一千八百零七户中，偷税的达百分之八十二，共一千四百九十户。
    展览品指明：许多不法的资本家们在为国家进行加工定货生产或和国营经济部门进行交易中，偷工减料、以坏顶好、破坏生产和盗窃国家财产的行为是十分丧心病狂的。这里展览着他们所制造的各种各样的劣品、次货，从军用雨衣到大量生产的布匹，以至人民每天吃、穿和使用的必需品。这些偷工减料的产品，有许多是根本不能用的。奸商乔铭勋、李炳甲等承制军用加工雨衣时，把好布偷换成次布，少用胶料和汽油，制出的雨衣透明漏水。为混过灯光检验，就在胶布里面涂上一层黑烟子。这批货曾使国家遭受损失一百二十五亿元。天津有大小六百多家私营纱厂给国营花纱布公司天津市公司加工生产，现在发现绝大部分都有偷工减料的行为。他们在纺纱时掺坏棉，织布时掺坏纱。织一幅布，可以少用数根以至六十多根经线。某两家较大的私营纱厂，从一九五○年三月到一九五一年十二月，在加工中用上述办法非法盗窃国家财产五十亿元。振华，国华、建华、永明等电线厂，在承制国家大批加工、定货生产时，在电线两头用好铜丝，中间用坏铜丝；用白布涂上油墨，代替涂胶的绝缘布；用臭油代替沥青；用坏石腊代替好石腊；两头用绝缘胶皮，中间用白布。他们的秘诀有“十大偷”、“八大偷”。偷到最后，在交货时还不够尺码。一根电线被他们从头到尾、从里到外偷盗的结果，就成了残品废货。使用起来，非常容易跑电、着火，造成灾害。这里陈列着不法资本家们使用偷盗法术所承制的各种产品：一条新的花色鲜明的被单，经过一次水洗，就红绿不分，颜色模糊；一双球鞋，只能穿十天半个月。中国工业器材公司通过靖元、东华贸易行买了七十亿元的墨灰，拿它作成油墨，却印不出字，因为墨灰是假货。中国石油公司华北区公司贪污分子倪鸿恩和奸商宋子佳相勾结，给公司买了二十亿元的假黄油，用它润滑机器，会使机器着火。奸商们为着攫取暴利，竟不惜把人民置于水火之中！全国人民把抗美援朝当成神圣的事业，而私营利兴蛋厂却忍心地偷盗人民志愿军的饷粮。去年七月，利兴蛋厂曾代理加工支援人民志愿军的蛋粉八十万斤，他们竟将每罐（一斤）少装了一两到三两半。
    这里展出的只是不法资本家们恶迹罪行中很少的一部分。每一个有良心的爱国的中国人都应该想想：我们应该怎样对待这些可恶的奸徒！
