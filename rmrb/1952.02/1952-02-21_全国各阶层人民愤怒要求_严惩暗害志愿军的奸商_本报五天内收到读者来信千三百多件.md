    People from All Strata Across the Country Angrily Demand
    Severe Punishment for Treacherous Merchants Who Harmed the Volunteer Army.
    Our Newspaper Received More Than 1,300 Letters from Readers in Five Days.
    [Report from our newspaper] People from all strata of society across the country feel extreme anger towards the heinous crimes of the great treacherous merchants Li Yinting, Wang Kangnian, and others who harmed the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. The vast number of readers, including workers, shop assistants, pedicab drivers, farmers, young students, cultural and educational workers, medical workers, commanders and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, commanders and soldiers of the People's Volunteer Army, families of the Volunteer Army, public security personnel, and staff members of organizations, groups, and democratic parties, industrialists and businessmen, as well as street residents, housewives, and Young Pioneers, have written to this newspaper one after another, demanding that the government severely punish these despicable, vicious, and inhumane great treacherous merchants. From February 16th to 20th, in five days, this newspaper received 1,357 letters from readers, with 588 letters received on the 20th alone. Many of these were joint letters signed by dozens or hundreds of people.
    The vast number of readers unanimously and severely denounced the treacherous merchants Li Yinting, Wang Kangnian, and others for losing their qualifications as Chinese people and being unpardonable traitors to the people of the motherland. These traitors not only seriously damaged the lives and health of the beloved Chinese People's Volunteer Army commanders and soldiers, undermined our people's great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, but also became detestable accomplices of the U.S. aggressors, and were a serious disruptor of the peaceful and happy life and the safety of life of our people. Construction worker Wang Dachuan, with hatred in his heart, accused the treacherous merchant Li Yinting, saying: "I think he is not only a great treacherous merchant, but also an accomplice of U.S. imperialism." People's Liberation Army soldier Lü Puqi said: "I firmly demand that the government severely punish these evil treacherous merchants." All the members of the Third Detachment of the Beijing Minguo Elementary School Young Pioneers wrote in a letter: "If we meet this treacherous merchant, we must bite him hard to eliminate the anger in our hearts."
    The extreme hatred of the vast number of readers for the great treacherous merchants Li Yinting, Wang Kangnian, and others is a manifestation of their high love for the heroic Chinese People's Volunteer Army, and is also a firm defense of the great movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. Reader Chen Buxiang said: "The Volunteer Army is fighting the enemy in the ice and snow to defend our happy life, and all conscientious people are enthusiastically supporting them. Our post office staff once used the proceeds from selling newspapers and magazines and voluntary labor to support the front line. Our comrades here who volunteered to work on the Korean front risked enemy fire to rescue the wounded and competed to give them blood transfusions. However, the treacherous merchants Wang Kangnian and others committed heinous crimes against the Volunteer Army. Such treacherous merchants have become rabid mad dogs, stumbling blocks to the movement to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and should be resolutely eliminated." All the staff and workers of the Beijing Machine Factory said in their letter: "In order to support the Volunteer Army, we have worked tirelessly to increase production, increase income, and donate airplanes and cannons; but the treacherous merchants Li Yinting and others used despicable and shameless means to steal our donations, and even harmed our 'most beloved people.' These treacherous merchants are the most hateful enemies hidden inside us." Young Pioneer Lu Lingxiao said: "In order to support the Volunteer Army uncles, we saved our candy money, the worker uncles also worked hard day and night to increase production, and even old Auntie Tian donated a pair of silver wedding bracelets that she had saved for more than 30 years; but these treacherous merchants have done such outrageous things, we must completely eliminate this group of bad guys." People's Liberation Army soldier Chenyang said: "When we celebrated the first anniversary of the Volunteer Army's participation in the war, we donated all of our one-month allowance to buy airplanes and cannons, but treacherous merchants like Wang Kangnian were stealing our donations and harming our Volunteer Army comrades."
    Volunteer Army commanders, soldiers, and wounded and sick soldiers used their personal experiences and what they saw with their own eyes to write letters exposing the heinous crimes of these treacherous merchants. Volunteer Army soldier Li Kaiwu said: "Last May, because we had been eating coarse grains for a long time and were undernourished, we were very excited when we received a large batch of canned beef. But after eating it, more than 90% of the people in our unit contracted dysentery. I myself was one of the victims. At that time, we thought it was due to poor environmental sanitation or dietary indiscretion. Now I know that these treacherous merchants were harming us." Comrade Wu Jinfeng of the Volunteer Army wrote in a letter, sadly describing the fact that a comrade he saw with his own eyes died of tetanus after using a "first aid kit" from a treacherous merchant, and another comrade had to have an arm amputated. He angrily demanded that these vicious treacherous merchants be severely suppressed.
    Many readers also severely condemned the ungrateful behavior of unscrupulous merchants. They emphasized that the Volunteer Army's heroic fighting on the Korean front was to protect the safety of the lives and property of the people of the motherland, and also to protect industrialists and businessmen so that they could operate their businesses with peace of mind. All conscientious industrialists and businessmen should express their gratitude and make redoubled efforts to do a good job in processing and ordering goods, and transport the best goods to the Korean front. However, the treacherous merchants Li Yinting and others repaid kindness with enmity, and shot vicious cold arrows at the Volunteer Army. Treacherous merchants who have committed such serious crimes cannot be punished as ordinary speculators and profiteers, but must be given the most severe sanctions. Many readers demanded that the government convene a mass public trial to severely suppress these criminals. Worker Sheng Dehai demanded that the government "severely punish all traitors who harmed the Volunteer Army." Readers also suggested thoroughly investigating all private merchants who have purchased supplies or processed orders for the Volunteer Army, exposing all their crimes, and not letting a single person escape. Readers also demanded a thorough investigation of all relevant units and personnel who purchased materials and inspected materials for the Volunteer Army, to see if these units and personnel had faithfully performed their duties.
    From the heinous crimes of the great treacherous merchants Li Yinting, Wang Kangnian, and others, the vast number of readers have more clearly recognized the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the country and the people. They have expressed one after another that they must carry out the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement to the end.

    全国各阶层人民愤怒要求
    严惩暗害志愿军的奸商
    本报五天内收到读者来信千三百多件
    【本报讯】全国各阶层人民，对大奸商李寅廷、王康年等暗害中国人民志愿军的滔天罪行，感到极度的愤怒。广大读者，包括各地的工人、店员、三轮车工人、农民、青年学生、文化教育工作者、医务工作者、人民解放军指战员、人民志愿军指战员、志愿军家属、公安人员和机关、团体、民主党派的工作人员，工商业者，以及街道居民、家庭主妇和少年儿童队员，纷纷写信给本报，要求政府严厉惩办这些卑鄙恶毒、毫无人性的大奸商。从二月十六日到二十日为止的五天内，本报收到读者的来信一千三百五十七件，二十日一天内就收到五百八十八件。其中许多是几十人、几百人的联名信。
    广大的读者异口同声地严厉斥责奸商李寅廷、王康年等丧失了作为中国人的资格，是祖国人民不可饶恕的叛徒。这些叛徒不仅严重地损害了人人爱戴的中国人民志愿军指战员的生命和健康，破坏了我国人民伟大的抗美援朝运动，并且变成了美国侵略者可恶的帮凶，是我国人民和平幸福生活和生命安全的严重破坏者。建筑工人王大川怀着愤恨的心情控诉奸商李寅廷说：“我认为他不但是个大奸商，而且是美帝国主义的帮凶。”人民解放军战士吕普琦说：“我坚决要求政府严厉惩办这些万恶的奸商。”北京民国小学少年儿童队第三中队的全体队员来信说：“如果我们遇见这个奸商，一定要狠狠地咬他几口，才能消除心头的愤怒。”
    广大读者对大奸商李寅廷、王康年等的极端的愤恨，就是对英勇的中国人民志愿军的高度的爱戴，也就是坚决地维护伟大的抗美援朝运动的表现。读者陈步湘说：“志愿军为了保卫我们的幸福生活，在冰天雪地中打击敌人，凡是有良心的人都在热烈支援他们。我们邮局职工曾经用义卖书报、义务劳动等所得来支援前线。我们这里志愿到朝鲜前线工作的同志更冒着敌人的炮火抢救伤员，争先替他们输血。但是奸商王康年等竟对志愿军干下了灭绝人性的勾当。这样的奸商已经变成了丧心病狂的疯狗，是抗美援朝运动的绊脚石，应该坚决除掉。”北京机器厂全体职工在来信中说：“我们为了支援志愿军，不辞劳苦地增加生产，增加收入，捐献飞机大炮；但是奸商李寅廷等却以卑鄙无耻的手段盗窃我们的捐款，甚至于还暗害我们‘最可爱的人’。这些奸商是暗藏在我们内部的最可恨的敌人。”少年儿童队员陆凌霄说：“为了支援志愿军叔叔，我们自己省下糖果钱，工人叔叔也起早贪黑增加生产，连上了年岁的田大妈也把保存了三十多年的一付结婚银镯献出来了；而这些奸商却干出了这样伤天害理的事，我们一定要把这批坏家伙彻底消灭。”人民解放军战士晨阳说：“庆祝志愿军出国作战一周年时，我们把一个月的津贴，全部捐献买飞机大炮，可是，像王康年一类的奸商竟在盗窃我们的捐款和暗害我们的志愿军同志。”
    志愿军指战员、伤病员，他们以自己亲身的遭遇和亲眼看到的事实，来信揭发这批奸商的滔天罪行。志愿军战士李开物说：“去年五月，我们因久吃粗糙的粮食，营养不足，在领到大批牛肉罐头时，都感到十分兴奋。但吃了以后，我们单位百分之九十以上的人都染上了痢疾。我自己就是身受其害的一个。当时我们还认为是环境卫生差，或者是饮食不慎所致。现在才知道这是这些奸商在暗害我们。”志愿军吴金风同志来信，悲痛地叙述着他亲眼看见一个战友因为用了奸商的“救急包”，得破伤风症死了和另一个同志不得不把一只手臂锯掉的事实。他愤怒地要求严厉镇压这批恶毒的奸商。
    许多读者还严厉地斥责了不法商人忘恩负义的行为。他们着重指出：志愿军在朝鲜前线英勇作战，是为了保卫祖国人民生命和财产的安全，也是为了保护工商业者能够安心营业。凡是稍有良心的工商业者都应该表示感谢，都应该加倍地努力作好加工定货的工作，把最好的物品输送到朝鲜前线去。但是奸商李寅廷等以怨报德，竟向着志愿军放出了恶毒的冷箭。对犯下这种严重罪行的奸商，不能按照一般投机倒把、贪图暴利的奸商来惩办，必须给以最严厉的制裁。许多读者要求政府召开群众公审大会，来严厉镇压这些罪犯。工友盛德海要求政府 “严惩一切暗害志愿军的叛徒”。读者并且建议彻底检查一切代志愿军购买过物资或者加工定货的私商，把他们的罪行全部揭发出来，不使一个人漏网。对于一切为志愿军代购物资和验收物资的有关单位和工作人员，读者也要求进行彻查，看这些单位和人员是否忠诚地执行了职务。
    从大奸商李寅廷、王康年等的万恶罪行中，广大读者更加清楚地认识到资产阶级向国家和人民的猖狂进攻。他们纷纷表示一定要把反贪污、反行贿运动进行到底。
