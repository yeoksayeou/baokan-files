The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government
Decision on Vigorously Launching a Mass Movement for Drought Prevention and Resistance
(Adopted at the 123rd Government Administration Council Meeting on February 8, 1952)

(I)
Since last autumn and winter, the northern regions have experienced scarce rainfall and snowfall, leading to soil drought. This situation will affect spring plowing and sowing this year and may lead to drought disasters.

Drought disasters have historically been harmful to agricultural production in our country. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, water conservancy was neglected, and forests were destroyed, resulting in more frequent disasters. After liberation, under the leadership of governments at all levels, the people of the whole country have achieved great success in the struggle against various natural disasters. However, due to insufficient attention to drought prevention and resistance, drought disasters still seriously threaten agricultural production.

In 1951, large areas of North China, Inner Mongolia, and Northwest China experienced spring and summer droughts. Even Sichuan North, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang and other provinces, which are known for abundant rainfall, suffered varying degrees of drought in most or some areas during the summer and autumn seasons. A total of 22 provinces and regions across the country were affected by drought, with a disaster area of 35 million mu, resulting in significant crop yield losses. This proves that drought disasters can occur in both the South and the North, and in any season of spring, summer, or autumn.

Now that spring plowing is approaching, if leaders at all levels, especially in the northern regions with less rainfall, do not recognize the severity of drought disasters, do not pay serious attention to the scarce rainfall and snowfall last autumn and winter, and do not draw profound lessons from historical disasters, and become complacent and lax, then once a drought disaster occurs, agricultural production will suffer huge losses, and may cause serious disasters such as disease epidemics, insect pests, and livestock deaths. This would weaken the strength of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and would cause great difficulties for the entire national economic construction. Therefore, at present, in addition to actively arranging spring plowing and continuing the long-term struggle against natural disasters such as waterlogging, diseases, and insect pests, all localities should also prominently strengthen drought prevention and resistance work, seize the season, take emergency measures, and mobilize all possible forces to launch a mass movement for drought prevention and resistance.

(II)
Fully carrying out ideological mobilization and deeply mobilizing the masses is the key to launching the drought prevention and resistance movement. Because drought disasters develop gradually, it is easy to cause cadres and the masses to be insufficiently vigilant, become complacent and careless, and foster negative and侥幸 thoughts of relying on the heavens for rain. This is the biggest obstacle to carrying out drought prevention and resistance. In response to this situation, it is necessary to use newspapers, radio, blackboards, etc., to conduct extensive publicity and explanation, and use specific examples to repeatedly explain the principle of "man can conquer nature" to the masses, inspire their enthusiasm, and establish confidence in the victory of drought prevention and resistance. Last year, drought disasters occurred in Chahar Province and other places, but many villages and experienced farmers actively prepared for drought prevention in advance, and carried out drought resistance during the drought period, and achieved normal harvests. During ideological mobilization, all localities can mobilize the masses to recall the painful scenes of past famines, organize veteran farmers or labor models to explain drought prevention and resistance experience, or introduce specific methods suitable for local drought prevention and resistance, to strengthen their determination to struggle.

After the masses are mobilized, labor mutual aid and human-animal labor exchange should be widely organized, and all forces should be mobilized to invest in the drought prevention and resistance movement. The leading role of rural cadres, party members, members of the Youth League, labor models, and activists should be fully utilized to ensure that this movement is thoroughly implemented.

(III)
The following measures must be taken to carry out drought prevention and resistance work:

Fully utilize all water sources and launch a mass movement to build farmland water conservancy projects. Each region should organize all manpower, material resources, and financial resources according to different natural conditions and mass habits, and call on people to vigorously restore and build various water conservancy projects according to local conditions. If river water and stream water can be used, canals, weirs, and beaches can be built. If surface water can be stored, ponds, dams, or small reservoirs can be built. If groundwater can be used, wells and springs can be dug and dredged. Various waterwheels, treadmills, water pumps, and other water-lifting tools should be greatly increased and repaired to increase the irrigation area. Expand the water storage capacity of existing ponds and dams to maximize their drought resistance effectiveness. Vigorously develop water wells, organize farmers to dig wells together; strengthen leadership over irrigation of existing water wells, organize mutual assistance, use them together, and expand the area of watered land. If the water volume is insufficient, organizing cone wells should be considered to increase the water output. All regions should produce waterwheels in large quantities and provide loans in a timely manner. In all engineering measures, technical guidance must be strengthened to ensure that the projects are effective, the construction season is grasped, and irrigation can be carried out in a timely manner without delaying agricultural work.

Fully achieve economical water use, cherish water volume, and maximize the irrigation effectiveness of water. All canals, dams, and weirs should strengthen irrigation management, reduce the amount of irrigation water to the minimum limit according to crop needs, and organize the masses to irrigate in shifts day and night to expand the irrigated area. Universally conduct the education of "farmers all over the world are one family," overcome the conservative and departmentalist thinking among cadres and the masses, achieve mutual assistance and concession, and promote upstream care for downstream, and old irrigation areas caring for new irrigation areas. In the northern region after the spring thaw, irrigation should be carried out early to expand the irrigation area and ensure sowing.

Summarize and promote the masses' experience in drought prevention and resistance in farming techniques. In most areas of the North, special attention must be paid to preserving soil moisture in spring. For fields that have been autumn-tilled and deeply plowed, they should be harrowed finely and multiple times in a timely manner after the spring thaw to maintain soil moisture. For land that was not plowed last autumn, it should be spring-tilled as early as possible after thawing, and plowed and harrowed as it is tilled. Agricultural leadership organs should promote the effective methods of drought-resistant sowing, such as seizing moisture, borrowing moisture, and carrying water to sow seeds, as early as possible, mobilize the masses, and prepare for the work to ensure timely sowing. Each locality can appropriately advance the spring sowing date according to local conditions, and areas with early sowing habits should promote early sowing experience. After emergence, pay attention to intertillage and weeding to reduce water evaporation. Promote the planting of drought-resistant crops and high-yield crops. It is also necessary to mobilize the masses to reserve seeds for famine relief and vegetable seeds. Agricultural organs and cooperatives at all levels should plan to purchase and transfer early-maturing, drought-resistant, and late-sowing seeds to ensure that no land is left barren.

Each township and village should organize to select a certain area of ​​cultivated land, take all possible measures to ensure that a considerable harvest can be obtained under any circumstances, to provide the entire township and village with the minimum needs in case of famine.

(IV)
Drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing are the most urgent tasks in rural areas at present and must be launched immediately and extensively to resolutely ensure that agricultural work is not delayed. From now on, all district and township (village) people's governments should concentrate all their efforts to lead the masses to engage in drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring sowing work in order to strive for this year's bumper harvest. In some areas, district and township levels are already carrying out the struggle against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy. It should be stopped immediately and must be carried out after the spring sowing is completed. People's governments at the county level must organize half of the cadre force, and provinces and special districts should also organize a certain force to go deep into districts and villages to promote this work specifically. It must be known that sound and strong leadership is the main link to ensure the victory of drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing. In areas with drought signs, drought prevention and resistance work must be personally responsible by the administrative head, with local agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, and civil affairs agencies as the main force, organize a production drought prevention office to be responsible for the leadership; and convene drought prevention and resistance meetings to formulate specific plans and implement them. When necessary, mobilization can be carried out comprehensively through people's congresses at all levels. Banks, trade, cooperatives, and other relevant departments at all levels must closely cooperate and provide farmers with timely support and supply in terms of materials and loans.

Constant supervision and inspection should be carried out on drought prevention, drought resistance, and spring plowing work, and summaries should be reported level by level. The achievements in leading drought prevention, drought resistance, and promoting spring plowing should be used as one of the conditions for performance appraisal. Cadres or the masses who have made achievements or special contributions in their work should be rewarded and commended, and may be selected as labor models. If organs and cadres fail to prepare for drought prevention in advance, are at a loss after a drought disaster occurs, and do not actively organize and lead drought resistance struggles and promote spring plowing work, they should be criticized or punished.

Local governments must take drought prevention as a major task in long-term production and construction. In addition to actively mobilizing the masses to cultivate the habit of preventing drought every year, they should also prepare to carry out basic construction of agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy in a planned manner, and launch a deep and extensive drought prevention and resistance movement. Under the leadership of our people's democratic regime, under the active struggle of the broad masses of farmers mobilized after the land reform, and under the great call of Chairman Mao to "increase production and practice economy to support the Chinese People's Volunteers," as long as people's governments at all levels pay attention to leading this movement, we have the confidence and assurance to overcome drought disasters and strive for a bumper harvest this year.

    中央人民政府政务院
    关于大力开展群众性的防旱、抗旱运动的决定
    （一九五二年二月八日政务院第一百二十三次政务会议通过）
    （一）
    去年秋冬以来，北方地区，雨雪稀少，土地干旱，这种情况，势将影响今年春耕播种，并可能酿成旱灾。
    旱灾对我国农业生产的危害是具有历史性的。在国民党反动统治时期，水利失修，山林破坏，灾害更加频仍。解放后，全国人民在各级政府领导下，向各种自然灾害的斗争虽取得了很大的成就，但对防旱、抗旱则因事先重视不足，旱灾依然严重地威胁着农业生产。
    一九五一年华北、内蒙、西北大部地区春夏干旱，素称雨量充足的川北、云南、江西、湖南、浙江等省大部或局部地区在夏秋两季也发生了轻重不同的旱灾。全国共有二十二个省区受旱，成灾面积达三千五百万亩，作物产量损失很大。证明不论南方北方，不分春夏秋季都有发生旱灾的可能。
    现在即届春耕，如果各地特别是雨量不甚充足的北方地区的各级领导对旱灾的严重性认识不足，对去年秋冬雨雪稀少的事实不予严重注意，不从历史性的灾害中取得深刻的教训，麻痹松懈，则一旦旱灾发生，农业生产就会受到巨大的损失，并可能引起病疫、虫害、牲畜死亡等严重的灾害，就会削弱抗美援朝的力量，就会给整个国家经济建设造成很大的困难。因此各地在目前除应积极布置春耕，并继续向水、涝、病、虫等自然灾害作持久斗争外，更应突出地加强防旱、抗旱工作，抓紧季节，采取紧急措施，动员一切可能的力量，开展一个群众性的防旱、抗旱运动。
    （二）
    充分作好思想动员与深入发动群众是开展防旱、抗旱运动的关键。由于旱灾是逐渐发展形成的，这就容易造成干部和群众对旱灾警惕不够，麻痹大意，滋长靠天等雨的消极侥幸心理，这是开展防旱、抗旱的最大障碍。必须针对这种情况，通过报纸、广播、黑板报等，进行广泛宣传解释，并应以具体事例，反复向群众说明“人定胜天”的道理，启发群众的积极性，树立防旱、抗旱的胜利信心。去年察哈尔省等地发生旱灾，其中不少村庄及有经验的农户因为事先积极作了防旱的准备工作，又在干旱期间进行了抗旱斗争，竟获得了常年的收成。各地在思想动员中，可发动群众回忆过去灾荒的痛苦情景，组织老农或劳动模范讲解防旱、抗旱经验，或介绍适合于当地防旱、抗旱的具体办法，以坚定斗争的决心。
    在群众发动后，应即广泛组织劳动互助，人畜变工，动员一切力量，投入防旱、抗旱运动中。并充分发挥农村干部、党员、团员、劳动模范、积极分子的带头作用，务使这一运动深入贯彻。（三）
    进行防旱、抗旱工作，必须采取下列措施：
    充分利用一切水源，开展群众性的兴修农田水利运动。各地区应根据不同的自然条件和群众习惯，组织一切人力物力财力，号召因地制宜地大力恢复兴建各种水利工程。能引用河水溪水的可开渠、垒堰、修滩，能蓄积地面水的可挖塘、筑坝或兴建小型水库，能利用地下水的可凿井浚泉。并应大量增添修整各种水车、筒车、抽水机及其他汲水工具，以增加灌溉面积。扩大原有塘坝蓄水量，更大地发挥抗旱效能。大力发展水井，组织农民合伙打井；对旧有水井灌溉应加强领导，组织互助，合伙使用，扩大浇地范围，水量不足的应组织锥井以增大出水量。各地区应大量生产水车并及时出贷。在各项工程措施中，须加强技术指导，保证工程应有效益，掌握施工季节，使能及时灌溉，不误农时。
    充分做到经济用水，珍惜水量，发挥水的最大灌溉效能。对一切渠道坝堰，应加强灌溉管理，根据作物需要，将灌水量减到最低限度，并组织群众日夜轮浇，以扩大灌溉面积。普遍进行“天下农民是一家”的教育，克服干部与群众中的保守、本位思想，作到互助互让，提倡上游照顾下游，老灌区照顾新灌区。在北方春季解冻后，应提早灌溉，扩大灌区，保证播种。
    总结推广群众在耕作技术方面的防旱、抗旱经验。在北方大部地区，须特别注意春季保墒。凡已秋耕并深耕的田地，在春季解冻后应及时细耙多耙，以保持土壤水分。去秋未耕地，应于解冻后及早春耕，随耕随耙。农业领导机关应及早推广过去抢墒、借墒和挑水点种等抗旱播种的有效方法，动员群众，做好准备工作，保证适时播种。各地可根据当地情况，适当地提早春季播种日期，凡有早播习惯地区，应推广早播经验。出苗后重视中耕除草，以减少水分蒸发。提倡种植耐旱作物和高产量的作物。并须发动群众储备备荒种子和蔬菜种子，各级农业机关与合作社应有计划地采购与调运早熟、耐旱、晚种的籽种，以保证不荒一亩地。
    每一乡、村应组织起来，选定一定面积的耕地，采取一切可能的措施，保证不论在任何情况下，均能获得相当的收成，以备万一荒灾发生时，供给全乡全村最低度荒之需。
    （四）
    防旱、抗旱和春耕的工作是目前农村中最紧迫的任务，必须立即广泛展开，坚决保证不误农时。所有区、乡（村）两级人民政府自现在起即应集中全力领导群众从事防旱、抗旱和春耕播种工作，以争取今年的丰收。现在区、乡两级，有些地区已在进行反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的斗争，应即停止进行，必须俟春耕播种完成后，再去进行。各县级人民政府须组织一半干部力量，省、专各级亦应组织一定力量，深入区、村具体推动这一工作。须知健全而强有力的领导是保证防旱、抗旱和春耕胜利的主要环节。凡有旱象的地区，防旱、抗旱工作，必须由行政首长亲自负责，以当地农、林、水利、民政等机关为主，组织生产防旱办公室，专责领导；并召开防旱、抗旱会议，拟定具体计划，贯彻实施。必要时可通过各级人民代表会议，全面进行动员。各级银行、贸易、合作及其他有关部门，必须密切配合，并在物质与贷款方面给予农民以及时支持与供应。
    对防旱、抗旱和春耕工作应进行经常的督促检查，和逐级总结上报。领导防旱、抗旱和推动春耕的成绩应作为考绩条件之一。干部或群众在工作中有成绩或特殊贡献者，应予以奖励表扬，并得评选为劳动模范。如因事先未作防旱准备，旱灾发生后又束手无策，不积极组织领导抗旱斗争和推动春耕工作的机关和干部要给予批评或处分。
    各地政府必须把防旱作为长期生产建设事业中的主要工作，除积极动员群众，养成年年防旱的习惯外，并准备有计划地进行农业、林业及水利的基本建设，开展一个深入的、广泛的防旱、抗旱运动。在我人民民主政权的领导下，在经过了土地改革发动起来的广大农民群众的积极斗争下，在毛主席“增加生产，厉行节约，以支持中国人民志愿军”的伟大号召下，只要各级人民政府重视领导这一运动，我们是有信心有把握战胜旱灾、并争取今年丰收的。
