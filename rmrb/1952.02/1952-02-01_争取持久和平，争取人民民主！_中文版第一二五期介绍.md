"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition No. 125 has been published.

The current issue publishes an editorial entitled "Two Worlds - Two Results" which states: After achieving remarkable victories in 1951, the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism is now stepping into 1952 with an invincible spirit. The editorial points out: The great Soviet Union is becoming stronger and more prosperous year by year, and its plans for developing the national economy are overfulfilled year after year. The most outstanding thing in the Soviet Union last year was the extensive undertaking of great communist construction projects. The Chinese people, while consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship, are solving and have solved some of the most important economic and political problems. The European People's Democratic countries have made important achievements in building socialism, and the level of industry in these countries has increased by half to three times compared with before the war. The German Democratic Republic successfully started its first five-year plan for economic development last year. The people's movement for peace in various countries has also developed greatly. The Communist and Workers' Parties in various countries have been further strengthened both organizationally and ideologically. They have established closer ties with the masses and have gained greater prestige and influence among the masses. The editorial then says: Last year was also a year in which the imperialist camp, headed by the United States, was further weakened, and the general crisis of capitalism became deeper and wider. The internal contradictions of imperialism have caused their disunity, and in their efforts to maintain their dominant position, they are trying to find a way out of war. The rulers of the imperialist camp are stepping up the fascistization of the state system. These are all measures they are attempting as a last-ditch struggle. The editorial concludes: The camp of peace and democracy is unprecedentedly united, and it is growing stronger and stronger. The camp of peace and democracy is moving towards victory and will surely win the final victory.

This issue publishes an article by Werner, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, entitled "The People of West Germany are Intensifying the Struggle for Peace." Werner says: An increasing number of German people have realized from their own experience that the West German ruling clique is dragging West Germany onto a dead end leading to war and disaster. The Adenauer government does not want to unite East and West Germany on a democratic basis, establish a peace-loving and independent Germany, and sign a peace treaty. On the contrary, it wants to further divide Germany and intensify the remilitarization of West Germany. This policy has aroused dissatisfaction among the broad masses, causing an unprecedentedly huge protest and resistance movement. In the referendum against remilitarization and in favor of a peace treaty, the people showed increasing enthusiasm despite bans and persecutions. West German trade union organizations launched protest movements against the reactionary trade union leaders' agreement with the Bonn government's rearmament plans. More and more Social Democratic activists and ordinary members also openly condemned remilitarization. In some areas, farmers launched a powerful movement against the seizure of farmers' land by the American and British warmongers with the help of the Adenauer government for military construction. Many clergymen of different denominations also participated in the movement against remilitarization and in defense of peace. Werner emphasized: In recent months, the struggle to defend peace has been more intense and larger in scale. Many facts prove that there are great opportunities to launch a movement for peace in West Germany. In order to organize a broader peace front in West Germany, systematic explanatory and educational work must be carried out; explaining to the masses that a peaceful solution to the German question is possible on the basis of a policy of thoroughly defending national interests; demanding that an all-German conference be held, followed by free and democratic elections nationwide, and then the conclusion of a peace treaty.

This issue publishes an article by Révai, a member of the Political Bureau of the Hungarian Working People's Party, entitled "Tito is a Colonial Mercenary of US Imperialism." Révai said: In November 1951, the Tito fascist group and the US imperialists signed a military aid agreement. This agreement clearly confirms that Yugoslavia has become a military stronghold of the American aggressors; the Yugoslav army has become their mercenary army. It clearly marks another step forward for the Tito elements on the road of betraying the national interests of the Yugoslav people, and indicates that the Yugoslav fascists have openly assumed the role of executors of the military conspiracy of the US imperialists. Révai pointed out: The reason why the rulers in Washington are concerned about Yugoslavia is primarily because it can serve as a springboard for aggression against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. Révai also said: Today, the rule of the Yugoslav fascists is supported by the assistance of foreign imperialism. The more unstable their position, the more they will risk everything and carry out military provocations. Yugoslavia is a hotbed of war. Therefore, it is necessary to have a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and pay close attention to the provocative actions of the Yugoslav fascist group.

This issue also publishes Mitin's "The Great Work of Creative Marxism," which discusses the historical significance of Stalin's report at the Seventh Enlarged Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International in December 1926: "Once Again on the Social Democratic Tendencies within Our Party."

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二五期介绍
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第一二五期已经出版。
    本期以“两个世界——两种结果”为题发表社论说：和平、民主和社会主义阵营在一九五一年取得了卓越的胜利之后，现在以不可战胜的精神踏进了一九五二年。社论指出：伟大的苏联一年比一年富强，它的发展国民经济的计划一年又一年地超额完成。去年苏联最特出的事情是广泛地进行了伟大的共产主义建设工程。中国人民一面巩固人民民主专政，一面解决并且已经解决了一些最重大的经济政治问题。欧洲人民民主国家在建设社会主义方面取得了重要的成就，这些国家的工业水平已经比战前提高了半倍以至三倍。德意志民主共和国已在去年顺利地开始了第一个发展经济的五年计划。各国人民争取和平的运动也有很大的发展。各国共产党和工人党无论在组织上和思想上已经更加加强，它们和群众已经建立了更加密切的联系，在群众当中得到了更大的威信和影响。社论接着说：去年也是以美国为首的帝国主义阵营更加削弱的一年，资本主义总危机更加深刻和更加扩大的一年。帝国主义内部的矛盾造成了它们的四分五裂，它们竭力要维持统治地位，因而力图从战争中寻找出路。帝国主义阵营的统治者正在加紧使国家制度法西斯化。这都是他们企图作垂死挣扎的措施。社论最后说：和平民主阵营空前地团结起来了，它在日益成长壮大。和平民主阵营正在走向胜利，并且一定会赢得最后的胜利。
    本期发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会书记处书记维尔纳的“西德人民加紧进行争取和平的斗争”一文。维尔纳说：日益众多的德国人民从他们亲身的经验认识到，西德统治集团正把西德拖上走向战争和灾难的绝路。阿登纳政府并不想在民主的基础上统一东德和西德、建立爱好和平的独立的德国和签订和约。相反地，它想使德国更为分裂，想加紧西德的重新军国主义化。这个政策引起了广大群众的不满，在广大群众中引起了空前巨大的抗议和反抗运动。在反对重新军国主义化和赞成缔结和约的公民投票中，人民不顾禁令和迫害而表现了越来越大的积极性。西德各工会组织发动了抗议运动，抗议反动工会领袖同意波恩政府的重新武装计划。越来越多的社会民主党活动分子和普通党员也公开谴责重新军国主义化。有些地区的农民展开了强大的运动，反对美英战争贩子在阿登纳政府帮助下夺取农民土地来进行军事建设。许多不同教派的教士也参加了反对重新军国主义化、保卫和平的运动。维尔纳强调指出：在最近几个月内，保卫和平的斗争是更加紧张而且规模更大了。许多事实证明在西德有展开争取和平的运动的巨大机会。为了更广泛地在西德组织和平阵线，就必须进行有系统的解释和教育工作；向群众解释：在彻底保卫民族利益的政策的基础上和平解决德国问题是可能的；必须要求举行全德会议，进而举行全国的自由民主的选举，进而缔结和约。
    本期刊载了匈牙利劳动人民党政治局委员里瓦伊的“铁托是美帝国主义者的殖民地雇佣兵”一文。里瓦伊说：一九五一年十一月，铁托法西斯集团和美帝国主义者签订了军事援助协定。这个协定明白地证实了南斯拉夫已变成了美国侵略者的军事据点；南斯拉夫的军队已变成他们的雇佣军队。它明确地标志着铁托分子在出卖南斯拉夫人民的民族利益的道路上又前进了一步，并且表示南斯拉夫法西斯分子已公开担当了美帝国主义者军事阴谋执行人的角色。里瓦伊指出：华盛顿统治者所以对南斯拉夫关心，首先是因为它可以作为侵略苏联和人民民主国家的跳板。里瓦伊并说：今天南斯拉夫法西斯分子的统治，是靠着外国帝国主义的援助来支撑的。他们的地位愈是不稳固，他们就愈加不惜孤注一掷和进行军事挑衅。南斯拉夫是一个战争的温床。因此必须要具有高度的革命警惕性，仔细注意南斯拉夫法西斯集团的挑衅行动。
    本期还发表了米丁的“创造性的马克思主义的伟大著作”一文，论述斯大林一九二六年十二月在共产国际执委会第七次扩大会议上的报告：“再论联共党内社会民主主义的倾向”的历史意义。
