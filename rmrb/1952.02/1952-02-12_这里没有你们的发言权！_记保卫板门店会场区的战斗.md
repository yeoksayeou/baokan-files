“You Have No Right to Speak Here!”
—A Record of the Battle to Defend the Panmunjom Conference Area
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Yan Wu

The sound of artillery fire from the American forces on the right bank of the Imjin River rattled the windows of the buildings in the Panmunjom conference area. In the conference tent, the American representatives openly clamored: "Unless you accept our plan, we are prepared to let cannons, bombs, and bullets continue the debate." Around the New Year of 1952, Ridgway, in an attempt to achieve his shameless demands of interfering in Korean internal affairs, launched the so-called "Debate War" on the Kaesong front.

The Chinese People's Volunteer Army (CPVA) position on Daedeok Mountain, nine kilometers northeast of the Panmunjom conference area, was geographically like a gate on the eastern side of Kaesong. From the mountain, one could see the green tents of the Panmunjom negotiation meetings, the vehicles of the American delegation traveling to and from Kaesong on the Munsan highway, and the vast expanse of the Imjin River. The south and southeast of the mountain were surrounded by a cluster of small hills. CPVA soldiers built an iron fortress here to protect the safety of the ceasefire negotiation area. When the enemy launched a frenzied attack, our soldiers warned them: "If you dare to use force here, you have no right to speak here!"

Although the enemy's firepower was fierce, turning the vegetation on the mountain to ashes, melting the snow, and turning the frozen ground over by several feet, the heroic Daedeok Mountain position stood firm, becoming the graveyard of the self-destructive enemy.

In the 88.6 position held by a certain company, the company commander Shao Wenqing told me that the enemy had launched more than twenty attacks here, in formations of companies and battalions. In a section of less than five hundred meters, American cannons fired so many shells that about seventy tons of steel fell. It was this American steel that turned the wounded and corpses left by Syngman Rhee's troops in front of our position into mincemeat. Yet our position remained standing.

At the highest point of this position, a soldier with enemy bloodstains on his clothes told me a story of battle. At the beginning of the battle, the soldier Kong Lingfa and his comrades discovered an enemy officer wearing a red band, looking around. Kong Lingfa shot the guy dead with one shot. After a while, two more enemies crept up the mountain. Kong Lingfa said to his comrade beside him: "It's not worth using the machine gun, give me the rifle." The two enemies fell in response. After a few more minutes, eight enemies rushed up. Kong Lingfa said: "It's time to use grenades!" Six enemies were not seen running back from the grenade explosion. Later, more than twenty enemies came. This time Kong Lingfa picked up the machine gun and said: "It's time to use you." Under the machine gun fire, more than half of the enemies fell, and the rest quickly fled back. From then on, the enemies rushed up in a chaotic mass. CPVA soldiers repelled the enemy more than ten times in total. At first, the enemy pushed people up the hill and rolled them down; later, they had less and less strength to push and fewer and fewer people to roll down; in the end, as long as one person fell in front, the enemies would tie a rope to the feet of the fallen person, regardless of whether they were dead or alive, turn around, pull them up, and run. January 5th was the most intense day of the battle. Under the cover of more than twenty American fighter planes and seventeen tanks, the 1st Division of the ROK army launched a fierce attack with five battalions. The billowing smoke and dust raised by cannons and bombs filled the sky above Daedeok Mountain. But when the commander contacted each position with a walkie-talkie, the voices coming from each position were so calm: "Don't worry, we are here!" At this moment, our artillery suddenly roared. In an instant, the enemy's tanks were turned into scrap metal in the thick smoke, four enemy planes caught fire and crashed to the ground, and the remaining enemy planes immediately scattered and fled. The enemy infantry raised their flags and ran away! I met the CPVA heroes who participated in the battle at that time. A combat team leader, Yang Xiuchuan, once led two soldiers to defend a position on the very front line of Daedeok Mountain. The enemy first bombed and strafed them with six planes, and then used three tanks to cover a company of enemies to launch repeated assaults. In repelling the enemy's sixth attack, two soldiers gloriously sacrificed their lives. At this time, he took off his cotton-padded coat, opened all the grenade boxes, and used grenades to repel the enemies who rushed up one after another. Later, when his grenades ran out, he picked up the grenades fired by the enemy and quickly returned them to the enemies who rushed up. That day, he crushed the enemy's attack in this way, without giving up an inch of land. The CPVA soldiers, who were protecting the normal progress of the ceasefire negotiations in the Panmunjom conference area, were shattering the enemy's attacks one after another, defeating Ridgway's "Debate War."

### “这里没有你们的发言权！”——记保卫板门店会场区的战斗

    “这里没有你们的发言权！”
    ——记保卫板门店会场区的战斗
    新华社记者  阎吾
    来自临津江右岸的美军大炮的炮声震动得板门店会场区内的窗户格格作响。在会议帐篷里的美方代表公然叫嚣：“除非你们接受我们的方案，否则我们准备让大炮、炸弹和子弹去继续辩论。”在一九五二年新年前后，李奇微妄图达到干涉朝鲜内政的无耻要求，就在开城前线发动了所谓“争辩战”。
    守卫在板门店会场区东北九公里的大德山我军阵地，在地理形势上恰似开城东面的一扇大门，在山上可以望见板门店谈判会议的绿色帐篷、开城汶山公路上美方代表团往返的车辆和白茫茫的临津江，山的南面和东南为一群小山岭所拱围着。志愿军战士们就在这里修筑起一座钢铁的堡垒，保卫着停战谈判会场区的安全。当敌人向这里发起疯狂进攻的时候，我们的战士曾经警告敌人说：“你们要是敢在这里动武，这里没有你们的发言权！”
    尽管敌人的炮火是猛烈的，山上的草木被打成了灰烬，积雪也打不见了，冰冻的坚土被翻起几尺深；但英雄的大德山阵地仍然屹立着，成了自取灭亡的敌人的坟墓。
    在某连所坚守的八八点六阵地上，连长邵文清告诉我敌人曾成连成营地向这里进攻了二十多次，在不到五百米的地段上，美国大炮打来了许多炮弹，约有七十多吨钢铁。就是这些美国的钢铁，把李承晚丢在我们阵地前沿的伤兵和尸体捣成了肉泥。我军的阵地却仍然屹立未动。
    在这个阵地的制高点上，一个衣服上染着敌人污血的战士向我讲了一个战斗故事。在战斗开始的时候，战士孔令法和他的战友发现了一个佩着红带的敌人军官在那里东张西望。孔令法一枪就把那家伙打死了。停了一会，又有两个敌人摸上山来，孔令法和身旁的战友说：“值不得打机枪，把步枪给我。”两个敌人也应声倒下了。又过了几分钟，有八个敌人冲上来。孔令法说：“这回该用手榴弹了！”在手榴弹爆炸处，有六个敌人就没见跑回去。后来敌人来了二十多个。这次孔令法拿起机枪说：“这回该用到你了。”在机枪扫射下，敌人躺下了一半多，剩下的很快地逃回去了。从这以后，敌人就挤成一团地乱冲上来。志愿军战士们一共把敌人打下去了十多次。起先敌人是推着上滚着下；后来就越推越没劲越滚人越少了；到最后只要前面倒下一个，后面的敌人不问是死是活就用绳子套在倒下来的人的脚上，掉过头去拉起来就跑。一月五日是战斗最剧烈的一天。在二十多架美军战斗机和十七辆战车的掩护下，李伪军第一师投入了五个营的兵力发动猛攻，炮弹、炸弹轰起的滚滚烟土弥漫在大德山的上空。但是当指挥员用话报机向每一个阵地联络时，从每个阵地上传来的都是如此镇定的声音：“请放心，有我们在！”这时，我军的大炮突然怒吼起来。顷刻间，敌人的战车随着浓烟被打成残废，四架敌机中弹着火坠地，其余的敌机立即四散逃命；敌人的步兵拔起旗子逃跑了！我会见了当时参加作战的志愿军英雄们。有一位战斗组长杨秀川曾带着两个战士守在大德山最前沿的一处阵地上。敌人先用六架飞机向他们轰炸扫射，然后用三辆战车掩护着一个连的敌人进行轮番冲锋。在打退敌人第六次进攻中，两个战士光荣牺牲了。这时他脱去棉衣，打开所有的手榴弹箱，用手榴弹打退接二连三地冲上来的敌人。后来他的手榴弹打光了，他又拾起敌人打来的手榴弹迅速回敬给冲上来的敌人。那一天，他就这样寸土不让地打垮了敌人的进攻。保卫着板门店会场区停战谈判正常进行的志愿军战士们，就这样粉碎着敌人的一次一次的进攻，打败了李奇微的“争辩战”。
