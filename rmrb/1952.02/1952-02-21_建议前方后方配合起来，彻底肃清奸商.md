    Suggest Front and Rear Coordinate to Thoroughly Purge Profiteers
    Comrade Editor: There are six of us who are siblings. When we saw the news in the paper about the profiteers in Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places harming the Chinese People's Volunteers, we were all furious!

    We can infer that the inhumane behavior of these profiteers is definitely not limited to what is currently exposed in the newspaper. Therefore, we suggest that the logistics departments of the Volunteer Army immediately and thoroughly inspect the materials sent from the motherland, look for loopholes, and provide clues. This way, the front and rear can coordinate to completely eliminate these scum!

    建议前方后方配合起来，彻底肃清奸商
    编辑同志：我们六个人是亲兄弟姊妹。当我们看到报上登载着上海、武汉等地的奸商暗害中国人民志愿军的消息后，都气愤极了！
    我们可以推断，奸商们这种绝灭人性的行为，绝对不只是现在报上所揭露的那一些。所以，我们建议志愿军的后勤机关，立即彻底检查从祖国送去的物资，寻找漏洞，提供线索。这样前后方配合起来，把这些败类彻底肃清！
