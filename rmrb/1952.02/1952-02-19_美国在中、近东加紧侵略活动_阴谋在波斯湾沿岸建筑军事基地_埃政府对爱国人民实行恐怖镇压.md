Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: American imperialism is intensifying its aggressive activities in the Middle East and Near East, attempting to transform this region into a military base for launching a new war.

Following the coup in Egypt, US State Department advisor Kermit Roosevelt arrived in Cairo on February 3rd to "study" the situation in the Middle East. Roosevelt met with many Egyptians, as well as Stebler, the head of the Egyptian-Sudanese Desk of the US State Department, and Madison, the counselor of the US Embassy in Egypt. These two had been sent by the US State Department to Sudan long ago to "collect intelligence." Roosevelt stayed in Egypt for a week, and after meeting with Prime Minister Maher, who was supported by American and British aggressors, he left for Transjordan on the 9th. According to a broadcast by Egyptian radio on the 2nd, the Sudanese government has allowed two American "experts" to survey uranium mines in southern Sudan for a period of two years.

Iranian newspapers widely reported on American plans to build naval and air force bases along the Persian Gulf coast. The "Ettela'at" newspaper reported that the United States is planning to further expand the Abadan Airport, making it an "airport of great international significance." This measure will be implemented as soon as the oil issue is resolved. Two delegations from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development are currently in Tehran negotiating with the Iranian government to "help" restore Iranian oil production. To increase pressure on Iran, the US Export-Import Bank decided not to grant Iran a $25.5 million loan until the oil issue is resolved.

American control over Syria is also being strengthened. According to Telepress, the United States has induced Syria to accept "Fourth Point Program" "aid" and the so-called Middle East Command plan. The Aleppo and Latakia regions of Syria will be designated as restricted areas and handed over to the "Middle East Command" for use. Former Nazi German officers are training the Syrian army under American orders. In addition, the United States has sent a military mission to Syria. According to a report by the Paris correspondent of the Lebanese newspaper "As-Shaab," officials of the French Foreign Ministry declared that French and American troops would land in Syria and Lebanon in April to carry out a plan of aggression against the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, February 13th: Cairo dispatch: The Egyptian government is implementing a reign of terror against the people in order to openly compromise with British and American imperialists.

The military decrees recently announced by the Egyptian government stipulate: 1. Authorize the Ministry of Interior to search houses and residences at any time, day or night. 2. The Ministry of Interior has the right to detain any suspect and has the right to decide whether to detain or release them. This decree will be implemented in Cairo, Alexandria, the Suez Canal Zone, and other parts of the country. Egyptian Interior Minister Mutada Maraji announced to foreign reporters on the 9th that the Egyptian government would persecute communists throughout the country to stop the people from opposing the new Prime Minister Maher.

Egyptian police have arrested a large number of Egyptians in Zagazig, Ismailia, Suez City, Port Said and other places in recent days. According to Egyptian official announcements, the Egyptian police arrested more than 500 people in the Suez Canal Zone and the Delta region in just three days from the 4th to the 6th. The "Al-Ahram" newspaper reported that on February 8th, police searched the residences of more than 260 people in Cairo and arrested more than 40 people.

The Egyptian government's intensified suppression of the people, according to Egyptian Prime Minister Maher's statement to the Associated Press on the 4th, is in order to "create a proper atmosphere" to achieve "better understanding" with the major powers of the "free world."

    美国在中、近东加紧侵略活动
    阴谋在波斯湾沿岸建筑军事基地
    埃政府对爱国人民实行恐怖镇压
    【新华社十七日讯】美帝国主义正在中东和近东加紧侵略活动，妄图把这一地区变为发动新战争的军事基地。
    在埃及发生政变以后，美国国务院顾问寇密特·罗斯福在二月三日到达开罗，“研究”中东局势。罗斯福会见了许多埃及人，以及美国国务院埃及苏丹科的负责人斯泰布勒和美国驻埃及大使馆的参事麦蒂森。这两个人是美国国务院早就派去苏丹“搜集情报”的。罗斯福在埃及逗留了一星期，他在和由美英侵略者支持而上台的马赫尔首相会谈以后，已在九日前往外约旦。另据埃及电台二日广播，苏丹政府已允许两个美国“专家”在苏丹南部勘查铀矿，为期两年。
    伊朗报纸广泛报道了美国阴谋在波斯湾沿岸建筑海空军基地的计划。“埃泰拉亚特报”报道说，美国正计划进一步扩充阿巴丹飞机场，使它成为“具有重大国际意义的飞机场”。一俟石油问题解决，这一措施便要实行。国际复兴开发银行的两个代表团，现在正在德黑兰和伊朗政府谈判“帮助”恢复伊朗石油生产的事情。为了加强对伊朗的压力，美国进出口银行决定在石油问题没有解决以前，不拨给伊朗二千五百万美元的贷款。
    美国对叙利亚的控制也正在加强。据电通社消息，美国已经诱使叙利亚接受了“第四点计划”的“援助”和所谓中东司令部的计划。叙利亚的阿勒颇和拉塔基亚地区将划为禁区，交给“中东司令部”使用。以前纳粹德国的军官正在依照美国的命令训练叙利亚的军队。此外，美国又派了一个军事使团到叙利亚去。据黎巴嫩报纸“阿西·夏勃”报驻巴黎记者报道说：法国外交部的官员宣称，法国和美国的军队，将要在四月间登陆叙利亚和黎巴嫩，以执行侵略中东的计划。
    【新华社十三日讯】开罗消息：埃及政府正在对人民实行恐怖统治，以便公开和英美帝国主义者妥协。
    埃及政府最近公布的军事法令规定：一、授权内政部不论日夜随时都能搜查住房和居民。二、内政部有权扣留任何嫌疑分子，并有权决定到底扣留他们还是释放他们。这项法令将在开罗、亚历山大港、苏彝士运河区和全国其他地方实行。埃及内政大臣穆塔达·马拉吉九日对外国记者宣布：埃及政府将在全国对共产党进行迫害，以制止人民反对新首相马赫尔。
    埃及警察连日在萨加齐格城、伊士美利亚、苏彝士城、塞得港等地逮捕了大批埃及人。据埃及官方宣布，在四日到六日三天内，埃及警察在苏彝士运河区和三角洲地区就逮捕了五百多人。“金字塔报”报道，二月八日，警察在开罗搜查二百六十多人的住宅，逮捕了四十多人。
    埃及政府对人民的加紧镇压，据埃及首相马赫尔四日对美联社记者称，是为了“造成正当的气氛”，以期获致与“自由世界”各大国间的“更好的谅解”。
