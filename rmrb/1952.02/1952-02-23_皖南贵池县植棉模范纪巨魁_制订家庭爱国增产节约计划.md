    Ji Jukui, a cotton farmer in the Second District of Guichi County, Chizhou Prefecture, Southern Anhui, harvested 95 jin (old scale) of ginned cotton per mu last year, the highest record for cotton yield per unit area in the area. Therefore, he was selected as a model worker in cotton planting in the county. This year, he and his wife have formulated a "Family Patriotic Production Increase and Thrift Plan" and posted it in the main room next to the portrait of Chairman Mao. His plan is as follows: 1. In agriculture, he will plant three mu of dry land (including the one and a half mu currently being reclaimed), with an increase of 15 jin of ginned cotton per mu compared to last year. The methods to increase production are intensive cultivation and more fertilization. He plans to apply three dan of cottonseed cake, 45 dan of human manure, and 60 dan of topdressing fertilizer. Each mu will be weeded nine times, and have soil added, have the terminal buds removed, have the branches trimmed once, and side shoots removed two to three times. 2. In sideline occupations, his three-fen vegetable garden yielded a total of 700 jin of vegetables in three seasons last year. This year, he aims to increase production by 150 jin. Besides eating some himself, he can sell 400 jin, which can be exchanged for four dou of rice. In addition, he will buy three hens and two roosters, which can lay more than 300 eggs a year, which can be exchanged for 50 jin of salt; and raise one duck. 3. In terms of thrift, the main emphasis is on saving food and expenses. Now that it is winter and they are not doing heavy work, they will eat less good food. They will not give gifts to relatives and friends for weddings and funerals. During the New Year and festivals, they will resolutely not engage in superstition or burn incense and paper money; and will use the money saved on the land. He will build an earthen ring around the vegetable garden's manure pit to specifically store ashes from the stove and dust from the ground as fertilizer.

    皖南贵池县植棉模范纪巨魁
    制订家庭爱国增产节约计划
    皖南池州专区贵池县二区棉农纪巨魁去年种的棉花，每亩收获皮棉九十五斤（老秤），这是当地棉花单位面积产量的最高纪录。因此，他被选为全县植棉劳动模范。今年他已和他老婆订出了“家庭爱国增产节约计划”，贴在堂屋里毛主席像的旁边。他的计划是：一、农业方面，种三亩旱地（包括正在开荒的一亩半），每亩比去年增产十五斤皮棉。增产的办法是精耕细作和多施肥料。准备上棉饼三担、浇人粪尿四十五担、施追肥六十担。每亩前后要锄九遍草，培土、摘心、整枝各一次，打杈二次到三次。二、副业方面，他种的三分菜园，去年三季共收七百斤蔬菜，今年要增产一百五十斤，除了自己吃，可卖四百斤，换回大米四斗；另外要买三只母鸡、两只公鸡，一年可生蛋三百多个，能换食盐五十斤；养鸭一只。三、节约方面，主要是省吃俭用。现在冬天不干重活，吃坏些；亲友婚丧不送礼，逢年逢节，坚决不迷信不烧香纸；把节省的钱都用到地里去。在菜园粪坑边砌个土圈子，专门囤积锅灶灰和地上灰尘作肥料。    汪洋之
