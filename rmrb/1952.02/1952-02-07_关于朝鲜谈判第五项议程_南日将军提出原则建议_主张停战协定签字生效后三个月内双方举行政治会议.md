Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, February 6th: At the plenary session of the delegation of both sides in the Korean armistice negotiations, the fifth item on the agenda, "Recommendations to the Governments of Relevant Countries of Both Sides," began to be discussed on February 6th. Our chief representative, General Nam Il, made principle suggestions on the fifth item on the agenda at the meeting, the full text of which is as follows:

"In order to ensure the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, it is hereby recommended that the opposing parties, namely the governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China as one party, and the governments of the relevant countries of the United Nations as the other party, each appoint five representatives to hold a political conference within three months after the signing and entry into force of the Korean Armistice Agreement to discuss: (1) the issue of withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea; (2) peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; and (3) other issues related to peace in Korea." The other side claimed that they would study our proposal carefully, and the date of the resumption of the conference would be resolved through further consultation by the liaison officers of both sides.

At the subcommittee of the fourth item on the agenda, in order to quickly resolve the fourth item on the agenda, our side agreed to hand over the matters that the subcommittee had already discussed and agreed upon to the staff officers' meeting of both sides to discuss specific clauses. The first meeting of the staff officers' meeting is scheduled to be held at 11:00 tomorrow morning. During the staff officers' meeting, the subcommittee will be temporarily suspended. Our representative also solemnly pointed out at the meeting that there are still significant differences between the two sides on the issue of releasing and repatriating prisoners of war. Our reasonable principle of unconditionally releasing and repatriating all prisoners of war is unshakable.

At the staff officers' meeting on the third item of the agenda, the other side stated that it did not have any new suggestions on the issues of rotation and rear port, where the main differences between the two sides lie. Both sides agreed to continue the staff officers' meeting at 11:00 a.m. on the 7th.

    【新华社开城六日电】朝鲜停战谈判双方代表团全体会议，在二月六日开始讨论第五项议程“向双方有关各国政府建议事项”。我方首席代表南日将军在大会中对于第五项议程提出原则建议，全文如下：
    “为保证朝鲜问题的和平解决，兹建议由敌对双方，即朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国两国政府为一方，联合国有关各国政府为另一方，在朝鲜停战协定签字并生效后三个月内各指派代表五人举行政治会议，协商：（一）从朝鲜撤退一切外国军队问题；（二）和平解决朝鲜问题及（三）与朝鲜和平有关的其他问题。”对于我方提案，对方声称将予仔细研究，大会复会日期由双方联络官再行协商解决。
    第四项议程的小组委员会上，我方为双方迅速解决第四项议程，同意将小组委员会所已讨论和已协议的事项，交给双方参谋会议商拟具体的条款。参谋会议第一次会议定明日上午十一时举行。在参谋会议开会期间，小组委员会暂时停开。我方代表并在会上郑重指出：目前双方在释放和遣送俘虏问题上，仍存在着重大的分歧。我方的无条件释放和遣送全部战俘的合理的原则，是不可动摇的。
    第三项议程参谋会议上，对方表示对于双方主要分歧所在的轮换问题，与后方口岸问题，并无任何新的建议。双方同意在七日上午十一时继续举行参谋会议。
