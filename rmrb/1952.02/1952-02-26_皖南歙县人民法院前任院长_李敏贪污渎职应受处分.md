    Former President of She County People's Court in Southern Anhui,
    Li Min, Should Be Punished for Embezzlement and Dereliction of Duty
    To the Editor: Li Min, the former president of the She County People's Court in Southern Anhui (currently studying at the Central School of Political Science and Law Cadres), has engaged in embezzlement, dereliction of duty, and other misconduct.

    During his tenure, Li Min confiscated the property of counter-revolutionaries Ye Wenhua and Cao Tingsheng without making an inventory or issuing any receipts. Li Min "safeguarded" items such as wristwatches, watches, pens, and white fungus, but they have now mysteriously disappeared. Li Min also embezzled and wasted more than two million yuan of the court's funds. Pan Jinpei, a cadre "acquainted" with Li Min, embezzled more than a thousand catties of public grain. Li Min accepted bribes from Pan, and as a result, Pan was only "educated" and nothing else happened. In 1951, Li Min colluded with unscrupulous merchants to sell drugs, arbitrarily undermining government policies. In 1950, when Li Min went south to work, he only had a small backpack, but now that he is going north to study, he is returning fully loaded, with more than a hundred pieces of "luggage."

    We suggest that the relevant leaders investigate this matter.

    皖南歙县人民法院前任院长
    李敏贪污渎职应受处分
    编辑同志：皖南歙县人民法院前任院长李敏（现在中央政法干部学校学习）有贪污、渎职等行为。
    李敏在任内，曾没收反革命分子叶文华、曹霆声的财产，既无清册，又无单据。李敏“保管”了挂表、手表、钢笔、白木耳等等东西，现在却不翼而飞了。法院的经费，李敏也贪污、浪费了二百多万元。和李敏“相识”的干部潘金培，贪污公粮一千多斤。李敏接受了潘的贿赂，结果只对潘“教育”了一下，就无事了。一九五一年，李敏勾结奸商贩卖药品，任意破坏政府的政策。一九五零年，李敏南下工作时，只有一个小背包，如今北上学习时，却满载而归，有“行李”一百多件。
    我们建议有关领导方面加以检查。
