Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Since the Beijing Public Trial of Major Embezzlers on February 1, the struggle to besiege major embezzlers in central government organs has achieved a tremendous victory, and this victory is continuing to expand.

The different treatments of the seven major embezzlers at the Beijing Public Trial pointed out the path to be taken for all embezzlers. The continuous exposure of the crimes of major embezzlement has further increased the awareness of the broad masses about the rampant attacks of the bourgeoisie, making them more enthusiastic to participate in the struggle. Therefore, since February 1, the number of confessed and reported cases has significantly increased. Most of these cases involve collective embezzlement, collusion with illegal merchants, "undercover" embezzlers sent by illegal merchants, and major embezzlers who pose a great threat to the national economy.

However, the most important achievement in this stage is that the vast number of activists and leading cadres have indeed mastered the law of discovering major embezzlers and have become proficient in a set of "tiger-beating" techniques. It has become a rule that any organ that handles large amounts of money or manages large amounts of materials is bound to have major embezzlement. Organs previously thought to have no major problems, so-called clean departments, especially cultural and educational departments, have now been proven to have a large number of major embezzlers. In the siege of major embezzlers, activists and various business insiders in various organs played an active role. In addition, the participation of family members of major embezzlers who refused to confess has achieved good results. In the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government, the family members of five embezzlers persuaded or reported their family members, thus solving the cases; one major embezzler who absconded out of fear of punishment was also reported by his family members and captured. In the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government, the family members of two embezzlers advised and reported their husbands. At the same time, many embezzlers who had already clarified the problems, in order to atone for their crimes, joined the battle to besiege major embezzlers, and they also played a certain role.

However, there are still many extremely stubborn major embezzlers in the central government organs who refuse to confess and make all kinds of denials. The cases of these embezzlers are generally more complicated and involve a wider range of people, and the degree of corruption and depravity of themselves is also the deepest. In order to effectively investigate these major embezzlers, each organ has launched a comprehensive investigation and research work in addition to sorting out existing materials. Each organ has formed a special investigation and research team to investigate and research specific cases. They deeply examine the economic situation of the organs, the source, amount, and use of large sums of money; the handlers of large sums of money and their personal relationships; clear the accounts, from calculating the general ledger to calculating the detailed ledger; study the reported materials and the living conditions and usual performance of the major embezzlers, in order to grasp sufficient materials and solve the cases quickly. The Central Committee for Economy and Thrift Inspection has also dispatched three teams to Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou to collect relevant materials. The Beijing Municipal Committee for Economy and Thrift Inspection has also organized a special agency to first examine the construction industry, which has the most serious problems, so that the materials from both government agencies and industrial and commercial sectors can be closely integrated.

At present, the siege of major embezzlers is becoming increasingly tighter. On the one hand, because the leadership is very determined, if it is not clear in January, add another month, if it is not clear in two months, then work for three months, and must thoroughly clear out all embezzlers. On the other hand, because the broad masses have stood on the front of anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy, and have already laid a net of heaven and earth for embezzlers, making them inescapable. Therefore, major embezzlers who grind the time, attempting to escape by luck, are bound to fail. All embezzlers, big and small, should face this situation squarely, quickly turn back and confess.

    中央各机关胜利围攻大贪污犯现
    正普遍展开调查研究工作深入追查一定要把一切贪污分子全部清查出来
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：自二月一日北京公审大贪污犯大会以来，中央各机关围攻大贪污犯的斗争，已获得了巨大的胜利，目前这一胜利正继续扩大中。
    北京公审大会对七个大贪污犯的不同处理办法，给一切贪污分子明确地指出了应走的道路。而大贪污犯罪恶的被不断揭发，使广大群众进一步认识了资产阶级进攻的猖狂，使他们参加斗争的情绪更加激昂。因此，二月一日以来，坦白和检举出来的案犯显著增加。这些案犯大多是集体贪污犯，跟不法商人勾结起来的或是不法商人派进来的“坐探式”的贪污犯，以及对国家经济危害甚大的大贪污犯。
    但在这一阶段中，最主要的成绩是广大积极分子和领导干部都确实掌握了发现大贪污犯的规律，熟练了一套打虎的技术。只要是用大批钱、管大批物的机关就一定有大贪污，这已成定律；过去认为没有大问题的机关，所谓清水衙门，特别像文教部门，现在也已证明同样有大批大贪污犯。在对大贪污犯的围攻中，各机关的积极分子和各种懂得业务的内行起了积极作用外，拒不坦白的大贪污分子的家属参加工作，收到了很好的效果。中央人民政府铁道部就有五个贪污分子的家属规劝或检举了自己的家人因而破案；其中有一个大贪污犯畏罪潜逃，也为他家属所告发，因而捕获。中央人民政府公安部也有两个贪污分子的家属劝告和检举了自己的丈夫。同时，不少已经弄清问题的贪污分子为了立功赎罪，投入了围攻大贪污犯的战斗，他们也起了一定的作用。
    但是，中央机关至今仍有不少极端顽固的大贪污分子，拒不坦白，百般抵赖。这些贪污分子的案情，一般比较复杂，牵连也比较广，而他们本人腐化堕落的程度也最深。为了有效地追查这些大贪污分子，各机关除整理现有材料外，已开展了普遍的调查研究工作。各机关已组成专门的调查研究小组，调查研究专门的案件。他们深入地检查机关的经济情况，大款项的来源、数目和用途；大款项的经手人及其人事关系；清理账目，从算大账到算细账；研究已经检举出来的材料和大贪污犯的生活情况及其平时的表现，以便掌握充分材料，迅速破案。中央节约检查委员会并派遣了三个小组分赴上海、天津和广州收集有关材料。北京市节约检查委员会又组织了一个专门的机构，首先检查问题最严重的营造业，以便政府机关和工商业两方面的材料能密切结合。
    目前，对大贪污犯的层层围攻是已经越来越紧了。一方面由于领导上的决心很大，一月搞不清楚，再加一月，两月搞不清楚，就搞三个月，非把一切贪污犯彻底全部清出不可。另一方面由于广大群众已经站到反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义的阵线方面来，已经对贪污分子布下了天罗地网，使他们无可逃脱。所以大贪污分子磨时间，企图幸免，就一定是要失败的。一切大小贪污分子都应正视这一情况，迅速回头坦白。
