    Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, has formulated a plan for drought prevention and resistance.
    Although Xingping County is not currently experiencing drought, the leading authorities attach great importance to drought prevention and resistance work. On the 17th of this month, the County People's Government convened an emergency mobilization meeting for drought prevention and resistance, attended by cadres above the district level and experienced farmers. Based on the different conditions of the plateau areas, low-lying areas, and slopes, the meeting formulated a county-wide drought prevention and resistance plan. The main content of the plan is as follows:
    I. In the water-scarce areas of the plateau, farmers should be mobilized to work the wheat fields during spring plowing: shallow hoeing once, rolling once, breaking up soil clumps, and weeding once; and applying more pig manure and ash manure to the wheat fields to conserve moisture. Land prepared for cotton planting should be plowed twice and harrowed six times from now until sowing, and then immediately rolled to ensure sowing is possible even if there is a lack of rain after Grain Rain. Cotton seeds must be soaked in warm water. When cotton seedlings emerge two or three inches above the ground, thinning should be encouraged, with more hoeing and branching to prevent excessive water evaporation. Each township should call on farmers to sow grain in rows, leaving wide spaces between rows to conserve moisture in case of rain. At the same time, each township should mobilize farmers to repair old ponds and dig new ponds to store rainwater. In addition, each household should plant half an acre to one acre of sweet potatoes or other early-maturing crops for famine relief, depending on the size of the population.
    II. Due to the special terrain of the slopes, farmers planting on slopes should be called upon to build soil mounds and ridges or dig ditches to collect water as much as possible.
    III. In the Weihui Canal irrigation area below the plateau, the canals will be extended this year to expand the irrigation area by more than 7,000 mu. To use water economically, canal irrigation management should be strengthened so that farmers can make "one row of crops, one row of ridges" as much as possible, and appropriately shorten the length of the ridges to ensure even irrigation. If the canal water is insufficient, inter-row irrigation can be carried out. Before the canal water is released, district and township cadres should mobilize farmers to level the fields; when the water is released, water diversion personnel and administrative cadres should closely cooperate to organize canal patrol teams, strengthen supervision and inspection, and ensure no water grabbing, water stealing, water interception, water leakage, or over-ridge watering, and adhere to the water use system of "quick watering and early closing, shallow watering, ditch watering, from bottom to top, from left to right." The canal irrigation cycle should be shortened from sixteen days to thirteen days, thereby increasing the number of irrigations from two or three times to three or four times. In non-Weihui Canal irrigation areas, farmers should be mobilized to repair 1,675 old wells and dig 1,135 new wells. This can expand the irrigated area by more than 13,000 mu. In areas near the Wei River, where there are many people and little land, and the land is scattered, farmers should also be mobilized to dig wells together and help each other use water, correcting the local farmers' idea that "digging wells is not cost-effective when there is little land." District and township People's Governments should organize farmers to use the funds saved last winter to purchase and repair water extraction tools.
    In order to unify the leadership of drought prevention and resistance work, Xingping County established a Spring Production Drought Prevention and Resistance Committee on the 18th of this month, and each district, township, and village will also establish a drought prevention and resistance committee or group of five to seven people. The Xingping County People's Government also decided that the increased irrigated land this year will not increase the public grain burden. According to this drought prevention and resistance plan, Xingping County can expand the irrigated area by more than 20,000 mu this year. Together with the existing 160,000 mu of paddy fields, the county will have irrigated land equal to more than one-quarter of the total cultivated land area. With the implementation of other plans in the drought prevention and resistance plan, Xingping County is basically confident of overcoming the drought that may occur this year.

### 陕西省兴平县  订出防旱抗旱计划

    陕西省兴平县
    订出防旱抗旱计划
    陕西省兴平县已订出防旱抗旱的计划。
    兴平县目前虽然不旱，但领导机关十分重视防旱、抗旱工作。本月十七日，县人民政府召开了一次全县区以上干部并有老农参加的防旱、抗旱紧急动员大会，会议根据塬上（地势较高的平地）、塬下和坡地三种不同地区，订出了全县的防旱、抗旱计划。计划主要内容如下：
    一、塬上缺水区，发动农民在春耕期间给麦田加工：浅锄一遍，碾一遍，打一次土块和拔一次草；并给麦田多施猪粪、灰粪，以便保墒。准备种棉的地，从现在起到播种前应耕两遍，耙耱六遍，并且随即碾过，使在谷雨后缺雨也能播种。棉籽必须温汤浸种。棉花出土二、三寸时，要提倡间苗，多锄、多打杈，以免蒸发过多的水分。各乡应号召农民条播种谷，行间留宽，以备落雨保墒。同时，各乡应发动农民修旧涝池，辟新涝池，储蓄雨水。此外，每户农民应视人口多少，种半亩到一亩红薯或其他早熟作物备荒。
    二、坡地地形特殊，应号召种坡地的农民，尽量堆土筑坎或修沟洫集水。
    三、塬下渭惠渠灌溉区，今年要延长水渠，扩大灌溉面积七千多亩。为了经济用水，应加强渠道灌溉管理，使农民尽量作到“一行作物，一行畦子”，并适当缩短畦子长度，务使灌溉均匀。如渠水缺少，可以间行灌溉。在渠道放水前区乡干部应发动农民平整田地；放水时，引水人员和行政干部要密切配合，组织巡渠队，加强督促检查，做到不抢水、不偷水、不截水、不跑水和不过畦浇水，坚持“快浇早关、浅浇、沟浇、由下而上，自左而右”的用水制度。渠道灌溉轮期由十六天缩短到十三天，从而使灌溉次数由二、三次，增加到三、四次。非渭惠渠灌溉区应发动农民整修旧井一千六百七十五眼，开挖新井一千一百三十五眼。这样可以扩大浇灌面积一万三千多亩。临近渭河地区，人多地少，土地分散，也应发动农民合伙打井，互助用水，纠正当地农民认为“地少打井不合算”的思想。区、乡人民政府应组织农民把去冬节约的资金，用于购买和修理汲水工具。
    为了统一领导防旱、抗旱工作，本月十八日兴平县已成立了春季生产防旱、抗旱委员会，各区、乡、村也将成立五人到七人的防旱、抗旱委员会或小组。兴平县人民政府并决定：塬下今年增加的水浇地不增加公粮负担。按照这个防旱、抗旱计划，兴平县今年可扩大灌溉面积两万多亩，连同已有的水田十六万多亩，全县将有等于耕地总面积四分之一强的水浇地，再加上防旱抗旱计划中其他几项计划的实施，兴平县基本上有把握战胜今年可能发生的旱灾。（新华社）
