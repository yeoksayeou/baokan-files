    Resolutely Repulse the Frenzied Attack of the Shanghai Bourgeoisie on National Taxation
    Gu Zhun, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Taxation
    Since liberation, the Shanghai bourgeoisie's attack on national taxation work has been as rampant and severe as it has been on other issues. Particularly since the Second National Taxation Conference in June 1950, the Shanghai bourgeoisie's attack on national taxation work has become increasingly serious.

    This frenzied attack is primarily manifested in tax evasion. In the past three years, Shanghai tax officials and shop employee organizations have conducted tax audits and seizures, uncovering more than 260 billion yuan in evaded taxes. In terms of audits of industrial and commercial taxes, tax evasion cases account for an average of 80 percent of the audited cases. This is the inspection organized by the tax authorities within their own capabilities. With over 100,000 taxpayers in Shanghai, and a duration of nearly three years, the number of inspections is extremely small in proportion. This means that the actual amount of tax evasion by the Shanghai bourgeoisie should be several times greater than what has been uncovered.

    The tax evasion behavior of the Shanghai bourgeoisie is planned and organized. Ordinary private manufacturers, except for a very few with strict tax management and strong employee organizations, do not dare to openly evade taxes and instead adopt so-called "legal struggles" (exploiting loopholes in tax laws). The remaining manufacturers try every possible means to evade taxes, such as setting up false accounts, not recording sales in the books ("flying across the sea"), dispersing and concealing inventory, and bribing tax officials. Around the time of the promulgation of the tax law in 1950, their main method of tax evasion was to withdraw funds and engage in commerce under different names. Their relatives, wives, and children could be registered as merchants, evading income tax by paying merchant tax. This activity was mostly linked to a set of shameless behaviors such as smuggling, currency speculation, evading funds, and attacking employees. They always used the excuse that they had set up secret accounts before liberation to deal with the Kuomintang reactionary government and had off-book property. Since they had off-book property in the past, there should be an opportunity to merge it into the accounts, and it was still excusable to have off-book property and off-book operations when this opportunity had not yet arrived. But, wasn't the method of re-evaluating property and adjusting capital a good opportunity to put off-book property into the accounts! In reality, after the re-evaluation of property, off-book operations and off-book property remained the same. Many factories and commercial firms have developed by relying on state entrusted processing and ordering, and even by relying on the supply of materials needed for resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, but they deliberately do not set up account books and try every means to be classified as enterprises with standard profit rates in their income tax declarations, evading the income tax they should pay. In order to evade taxes, they can spend large sums of money to hire so-called "accounting experts" to help them engage in "legal struggles" with the People's Government. The work done by these "experts" is not at all to improve the accounting system to improve business management. They are actually tax law consultants and "experts" in tax evasion. When the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Taxation was inspecting the account books of a factory, an "accountant" was present during the entire inspection time, and his so-called auditing was to catch up and plug loopholes, which was naturally self-evident.

    Many of the tax evasion behaviors listed above were done by some private enterprise representatives in the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce and its various institutions, or they led them. Weng Minru, the chairman of the Hardware Industry Association, colluding with four or five other companies in the same industry to collectively speculate in foreign exchange and evade taxes is one example. The huge tax evasion case of the Minfeng and Huafeng paper mills managed by Zhu Peinong, a member of the Executive Committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, is another example. Many capitalists talk about supporting the tax policy at various meetings, but what they do behind their backs is completely different. Someone said, "This is due to a lack of understanding of tax laws, and at the same time, old habits from before liberation have not been completely changed." Well, this could be said in 1949 and 1950, but by 1951, the tax laws had been promulgated for a long time, taxes had been paid according to the tax laws for a long time, and the publicity about taxation had been widespread. Almost all capitalists could talk a great deal about the importance of national taxation. Can they still say that they do not understand the tax laws, or that old habits have not changed? Please tell me, when will your old habits change?

    The characteristics of the tax evasion behavior of the Shanghai bourgeoisie are: on the one hand, many capitalists are constantly evading taxes; on the other hand, some private enterprise representatives in the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce take various measures to obstruct the further strengthening of tax management and hinder shop employees from mobilizing to assist in tax work, objectively forming an organized cover-up for tax evasion. For example, in April 1951, after the Working Group of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government came to Shanghai to inspect tax work, it instructed Shanghai to change the method of democratic appraisal, that is, to change the method of having each trade association appraise to having each taxpayer mutual aid group carry out the appraisal, and instructed that such appraisals should include shop employees. When the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Taxation drafted a plan based on this instruction and submitted it to relevant parties for discussion, some private enterprise representatives in the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce expressed strong opposition, and even stated that this plan could not be implemented without their consent. The fact is very clear, they opposed this plan because the scope of the appraisal was reduced, and large-scale tax evasion would become difficult or impossible after shop employees participated in the appraisal. Since large-scale tax evasion is being carried out, and some representatives of the bourgeoisie are using their own powers to cover up these criminal acts, what reason is there to say that it is the illegal behavior of individual capitalists, and not the frenzied attack of the bourgeoisie? In this situation, it is not accidental that the responsible person of the capital side in the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Taxation's inspection of the Minfeng and Huafeng Paper Mill cases expressed a threatening attitude to the tax officials, and even said things like "Are you afraid of reconsideration?" The frenzied attack of the Shanghai bourgeoisie on national taxation has thus caused incalculable losses to the country. If the amount of tax evasion discovered only through inspection is more than 260 billion yuan, and the scope of inspection is very narrow, then the amount of tax evasion that has not been inspected in nearly three years should be several times this amount. The purpose of the hardworking production of the working people across the country is to support the Chinese People's Volunteers and strive for victory in resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, and to rapidly build our country's industry. Naturally, the bourgeoisie will not be allowed to steal state property by means of tax evasion. Bravely and resolutely engage in the current movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and reduced materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, and resolutely repulse the Shanghai bourgeoisie's frenzied attack on national taxation. This is the task of struggle for all shop employees and the broad masses of people in the city. (Xinhua News Agency)

    坚决打退上海资产阶级对国家税收的猖狂进攻
    上海市税务局局长　顾准
    解放以来，上海资产阶级对国家税收工作的进攻，和在其他问题上是一样的猖狂、一样的严重的。特别是从一九五零年六月第二次全国税务会议后，上海资产阶级对国家税收工作的进攻就愈来愈严重了。
    这种猖狂进攻首先表现在偷税漏税上。将近三年来，上海市税务人员和店员职工组织查账缉私，查获逃税漏税额二千六百多亿元。就工商业税的查账来说，平均逃税漏税案件占查账案件中百分之八十。这是税务机关就自己力量能及范围内所组织的检查。全上海十多万纳税户，时间延续将及三年，检查次数从比例上看是极少的。这也就是说，实际上上海资产阶级逃税漏税的数目应当几倍于被查获的。
    上海资产阶级的偷税漏税行为是有计划、有组织地进行的。一般的私营厂商，除了极少数税务管理较严，职工组织力量强大的，还不敢公然逃税，而采取所谓“合法斗争”（钻税法空子）的办法而外，其余的厂商总是千方百计逃税，例如设置假账、营业额不入账“飞过海”、分散隐藏存货、贿赂税务人员等等。一九五零年税法公布前后，他们逃税的主要办法是抽调资金，化名行商，他们的亲戚、妻子、儿女都可以登记为行商，借着报缴行商税逃避所得税。这个勾当大部分又和走私、套汇、逃避资金、进攻职工等一套无耻行为相联系着的。他们总是藉口解放前为对付国民党反动政府，因而设置暗账，有账外财产。既然从前有账外财产，归并账内就要有一个机会，并且说这个机会还没有的时候，有账外财产，有账外经营，还是可以原谅的。但是，重估财产调整资本的办法总是账外财产入账的好机会了吧！实际上重估财产以后，账外经营依然如故，账外财产依然如故。许多工厂和商行是依靠国家委托加工和定货发展起来的，甚至是依靠供应抗美援朝所需物资发展起来的，竟故意不设账册，在所得税报缴中千方百计列入标准纯益率户，逃避应纳的所得税。他们为了偷税漏税，可以花费很大的款额去聘请所谓“会计专家”，帮他们跟人民政府来“合法斗争”。这些“专家”们所做的工作，根本不是改善会计制度以改善经营管理，他们实际上是税法顾问，是逃税的“专家”。上海市税务局在检查一家工厂账册时，整个检查时间中，同时有一个“会计师”在查账，其所谓查账是赶在后面补漏洞，自然也是不言而喻的了。
    上面所列举的许多偷税漏税的行为，相当大部分就是上海市工商业联合会及其各个机构中若干私营企业代表人物自己干出来的事，或者是他们领头干出来的事。五金业同业公会主任委员翁敏如，伙同同业四五家集体套汇、偷税是一个例子。市工商业联合会执行委员竺培农所管理的民丰、华丰造纸厂的巨大偷税案件又是一个例子。不少资本家在各种会议上讲拥护税收政策，背地里做的完全是另外一套。有人说，“这是不明税法，同时解放以前旧习惯尚未完全改过来。”好吧，一九四九、一九五零年可以这样说，到了一九五一年，税法公布已久，按税法纳税已久，关于税务的宣传已经普遍，几乎所有的资本家都能讲一套国家税收重要性的大道理，还能说不明税法，还能说旧习惯未改吗？请问你们的旧习惯到什么时候才能改呢？
    上海资产阶级偷税漏税行为的特点是：一方面许多资本家经常在偷税漏税；另一方面，市工商业联合会中若干私营企业代表却采取各种办法来阻挠税收管理的进一步加强，阻挠店员职工动员起来协助税收工作，客观上形成有组织地掩护偷税漏税。例如一九五一年四月，中央人民政府财政部工作团来上海检查税收工作后，指示上海应该改变民主评议办法，即是把从前交给各个同业公会评议的办法变为交给各个纳税互助组实行评议，并指示这样的评议应该吸收店员职工参加。上海市税务局根据这一指示，起草了办法提交有关方面讨论时，市工商业联合会中若干私营企业代表人物竟表示坚决的反对态度，并且居然表示这个办法没有他们同意就不能实行。事实很明白，他们之所以反对这个办法，就因为评议范围划小了，评议有了店员职工参加之后，大量的偷税漏税就要变得困难或者不可能了。既然大规模的偷税漏税在进行着，而资产阶级的若干代表人物又利用其本身的职权来掩护这些犯罪行为，还有什么理由说是个别资本家的不法行为，而不是资产阶级的猖狂进攻呢？在这种情形下，上海市税务局检查民丰、华丰造纸厂案件中，资方负责人对税务工作人员所表示的威吓态度，甚至说出“你们是怕复议吧”这一类的话，也就不是偶然的了。上海资产阶级对国家税收的猖狂进攻，因而造成国家的损失是不可计量的。如果说，仅仅经过检查所发现的偷税漏税数目是二千六百多亿元，而检查的范围又是很狭小的，那么将近三年来没有检查出来的偷税漏税数额应当几倍于这个数目。全国劳动人民的勤劳生产，目的就是要支持中国人民志愿军，争取抗美援朝的胜利，就是要迅速建设我们国家的工业，自然决不允许资产阶级以偷税漏税的方法来盗窃国家财产。勇敢坚决投入目前反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动，坚决打退上海资产阶级对国家税收工作的猖狂进攻，这是目前全上海店员职工和全市广大人民的斗争任务。　　（新华社）
