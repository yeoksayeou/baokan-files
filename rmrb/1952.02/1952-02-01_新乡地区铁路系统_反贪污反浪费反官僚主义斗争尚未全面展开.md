    Xinxiang Area Railway System
    The Struggle Against Corruption, Waste, and Bureaucracy Has Not Yet Fully Unfolded

    Editor: The anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the Xinxiang area railway system of Pingyuan Province has not been well-launched so far. The leading cadres of the Xinxiang area railway system have not truly mobilized the masses, and have only conducted self-examinations for more than a month. In this way, the movement cannot be popularized across the board. The workers see that other departments have already entered the stage of confession and denunciation, while their own railway units have not yet started up. The leadership says that this movement will be carried out thoroughly after the democratic reform movement is completed. I think this statement is completely wrong. We should implement criticism and self-criticism in this movement in order to truly do a good job of democratic unity. Now, some workers are already wondering: why can't this movement in our unit enter a climax? I think the Xinxiang area railway system should immediately mobilize the masses and fully launch the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement. Zhong Jingting

    新乡地区铁路系统
    反贪污反浪费反官僚主义斗争尚未全面展开
    编辑同志：平原省新乡地区铁路系统到现在为止，还没有很好地展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。新乡地区铁路系统的领导干部没有真正发动群众，只自己做了一个多月的检查。这样，运动就不能普及到全面。职工们眼看其他部门都已进入坦白检举阶段，而自己铁路单位却老不开展起来。领导方面说，搞好民主改革运动后再彻底进行这次运动。我认为这种说法是完全错误的。我们应该把批评和自我批评贯彻到这次运动中去，才能真正搞好民主团结工作。现在，有些职工已在怀疑：为什么我们单位的这次运动不能进入高潮？我觉得新乡地区铁路系统应立刻发动群众，全面展开反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动。　仲敬庭
