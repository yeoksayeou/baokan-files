There are currently 188 rural theatrical troupes in the county. Since the launch of the mass creation movement, remarkable achievements have been made. Among them, 121 theatrical troupes in 12 townships of Dongcheng District have created 392 scripts. The more prominent example is Dongcheng District's 12 townships and 39 troupes, which have compiled 206 scripts, achieving a situation where every township has a troupe and every township writes and performs its own plays. Many excellent works have been created, such as "Attending Winter School" self-compiled by Yantan Township in Dongcheng District, and "Marriage Autonomy" self-compiled by Miaoxi Village, which have been well received by the masses.
