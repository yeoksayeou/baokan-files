Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 3rd. The General Party Committee of Directly Subordinate Organs of the CCP Central Committee's Central and Southern Bureau and the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee of the CCP convened a meeting of senior cadres of directly subordinate organs on January 29th. Deng Zihui, Second Secretary of the CCP Central Committee's Central and Southern Bureau, made a summary report on the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy campaign in the first-level organs of Central and Southern China.

After summarizing the achievements and experiences already gained in the movement, Deng Zihui emphasized that the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement in the first-level organs of Central and Southern China should focus on anti-corruption, especially on opposing major corruption. This is the focus of the movement and the decisive stage. If no results are achieved in this stage, the movement will be considered a failure. In terms of the number of people involved and the loss of assets, corruption may be less than waste, but the nature of corruption and its harm to the country are extremely serious. In the past three years, due to the bourgeoisie's frantic attacks, many cadres could not withstand the bourgeoisie's sugar-coated bullets. Some were injured, some were captured by the enemy, and some even became enemies of the revolution. On the other hand, some illegal bourgeois elements infiltrated the internal organs and enterprises to lure cadres, steal business information, and steal state property, colluding with external illegal merchants from within and without to attack the revolution. Therefore, only by eliminating all corrupt elements, especially major embezzlers, can we rectify the revolutionary ranks and purify the internal organs and enterprises; only in this way can we repel the bourgeoisie's frantic attacks and give them a firm, relentless, and powerful counterattack. Of course, we will continue to resolutely protect all legitimate industrialists and businessmen and ensure that they obtain certain legitimate profits. This policy has not changed in the slightest. However, the illegal acts of illegal industrialists and businessmen (such as bribery, tax evasion, shoddy workmanship, theft of state property, theft of state economic intelligence, etc.) must be severely punished, and the corrupt and decadent ideology of the bourgeoisie must be criticized and transformed, so that everyone can be vigilant and the bourgeoisie will no longer dare to use illegal means or fire sugar-coated bullets.

Regarding how to carry out the anti-major corruption struggle in the future, Deng Zihui pointed out:

First, the entire party must have a unified understanding, fully recognize the harm of corruption to the country and the people, recognize the great significance, complexity, and arduousness of carrying out the anti-corruption struggle, and recognize that this is a serious class struggle, a major battle. Therefore, the entire party and all cadres, all staff, and all workers must act in unison, with common hatred, resolutely fight, and seek complete victory in the struggle.

Second, the command structure must be strengthened. The streamlining and economy committees at all levels must increase the number of pure, reliable, experienced, and capable cadres to strengthen their work, establish special offices, and have sufficient capable personnel responsible for inspection, research, material collection, investigation, and other work. This is even more important than the first stage.

Third, the ranks must be reorganized. Each ministry and unit should convene party and Communist Youth League meetings, cadre meetings, and mass meetings to re-conduct ideological mobilization for the anti-corruption struggle. After making self-criticisms, leaders at all levels should immediately go to the front to command operations. Those who have made mistakes of waste and blurring the lines between public and private and have been mistakenly regarded as corrupt should have the lines drawn according to the Central and Southern Bureau's boundaries and handling methods for waste, to encourage their enthusiasm and initiative to participate in the anti-corruption struggle. In the struggle against major corruption, it is especially important to closely cooperate with the store employees' and workers' reporting movement. We must encourage them to stand firm on the working class's position and make them recognize their future: to follow the Communist Party and the People's Government to socialism, and not to follow illegal merchants on the wrong path.

Fourth, corrupt elements must be divided. We must implement the policy of punishing those who are corrupt, being lenient with those who confess, severely punishing those who resist, educating and transforming those who repent, and rewarding those who report meritorious deeds. For state personnel who have embezzled small amounts and whose circumstances are relatively minor, if they can confess thoroughly, repent publicly, return the embezzled money as appropriate, and guarantee that they will not commit the crime again in the future, they can generally be exempted from legal punishment; those who have embezzled large amounts can also be treated leniently as long as they can truly and thoroughly confess. Those who actively report others' corruption after confessing and make meritorious contributions will be allowed to offset their crimes with their merits, and those who have made special contributions will be rewarded as appropriate. Illegal industrialists and businessmen will also be dealt with separately depending on the seriousness of their circumstances and whether they confess. In general, the following can be stipulated: A. Those who send small amounts of rebates according to general business practices will not be punished. Those who send large amounts of rebates and "wear hats" will be regarded as bribery, but those who confess can be punished leniently; state personnel who receive rebates will be regarded as corruption. B. Those who conceal taxes will only be required to pay the taxes evaded in 1951 after confessing to the tax authorities, and no additional punishment will be imposed; if they are discovered without confessing, the tax arrears will be recovered from the time of liberation, and they will be punished separately. C. Bribers who send general small gifts in the nature of attracting customers will not be punished. Those who send money and valuables will be exempted from punishment if they can thoroughly confess to the bribed organs and enterprises. Those who do not confess will be punished, and the illegal profits obtained through bribery should be fully recovered. D. For fraudulent acts, such as substituting inferior goods for good ones, fake goods for genuine ones, low prices for high prices, and shoddy workmanship in construction, in addition to recovering all losses, punishment should also be imposed, but those who confess early will be treated leniently. E. Those who steal state property will have all stolen goods recovered in addition to being severely punished, and those who confess will be treated leniently. F. Those who steal state economic intelligence will have the extra profits obtained from obtaining the intelligence recovered in addition to being severely punished, and those who confess can also be treated leniently.

Fifth, strategic and tactical research is needed. Based on the specific circumstances of each system and unit, determine their key departments, key sections, key targets, and general plans, and then concentrate efforts, collect materials, and seek to solve cases. The general method of solving cases is to search the mountains and encircle (collect materials), track and investigate (study materials), make key breakthroughs (find weaknesses to solve major cases), expand the results (strive for large, medium, and small corrupt elements to confess), and report experiences (write reports and inform each unit).

Deng Zihui called on all party members, all staff, and all workers to actively report major embezzlers, resolutely fight against major embezzlers, and seek complete victory in the movement. Deng Zihui warned state organ personnel and illegal industrialists and businessmen who have engaged in corruption to turn back as soon as possible and thoroughly confess to the state and the people. Do not continue to be obsessed and go down the dead end, and do not play small tricks, trying to get away with luck; you must know that the nationwide anti-corruption movement is generally rising, and it will be tighter year by year. In this case, if you do not confess, others will confess, if there are no reports here, there will be reports there, if there are no materials here, there will be materials there, if the case is not solved this year, it will be solved next year. In this case, what way can all corrupt and illegal elements escape the dragnet, what way can they get away with luck? These people must be warned to consider their future, and they must be asked whether they plan to be Chinese, whether they plan to be Chinese forever; if they do not plan to do so, then that is the end of it, but if they still want to be Chinese, and want to be Chinese forever, then their only way out is to confess thoroughly, there is no second way out. Even if they themselves die, but the case is not closed, and the case is solved later, it will still implicate the family, harming children and grandchildren. "If you don't want others to know, don't do it yourself." If you have already become a corrupt element, you can't hide it, and you can't escape it. The only way out is to confess, only to confess thoroughly, there is no other way out.

    中共中央中南局等召开直属机关高级干部会议  
    邓子恢同志号召检举大贪污犯  
    警告贪污分子和不法商人迅速彻底坦白
    【新华社汉口三日电】中共中央中南局、中共中南军政委员会直属机关总党委会在一月二十九日召开各直属机关高级干部会议，由中共中央中南局第二书记邓子恢就中南一级机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动进行情况作总结报告。
    邓子恢在总结了运动已获得的成绩和经验后，着重指出：今后中南一级机关的反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动，应以反贪污特别要以反对大贪污为中心内容。这是运动的重心所在，也是运动的决战阶段，如不能在这一阶段取得战绩，运动就算失败。就人数和资财损失来说，贪污可能比浪费要少，但贪污的性质及贪污对国家的危害是极端严重的。三年来由于资产阶级的疯狂进攻，不少干部经不起资产阶级糖衣炮弹的攻击，有的受了伤，有的作了敌人的俘虏，甚至与革命为敌。另一方面有些资产阶级不法分子混进机关企业内部来引诱干部，盗窃商情，盗窃国家财产，与外部不法商人里应外合，向革命进攻。因此，只有肃清一切贪污分子特别是大贪污犯，才能整顿好革命队伍，纯洁机关企业内部；也只有如此，才能打退资产阶级的疯狂进攻，并予以坚决的无情的有力的反击。当然，我们对一切正当工商业者，仍坚决予以保护，并保证他们取得一定的正当利润，这个政策并未丝毫改变，但对不法工商业者的不法行为（如行贿、偷税漏税、偷工减料、盗窃国家财产、盗窃国家经济情报等），就必须予以严厉惩办，并批判改造资产阶级的腐化堕落思想，以便使大家知所警惕，并使资产阶级再不敢行使不法手段、发射糖衣炮弹。
    关于今后如何开展反大贪污斗争，邓子恢指出：
    第一，要全党认识一致，充分认识贪污现象对于国家和人民的危害性，认识开展反贪污斗争的重大意义及其复杂性和艰巨性，认清这是一场严重的阶级斗争，是一场大恶战，因此，全党和全体干部、全体工作人员、全体职工必须一致行动，同仇敌忾，坚决作战，求得斗争的全部胜利。
    第二，要加强指挥机构，各级精简节约委员会必须增调纯洁可靠及有经验、能力的干部，加强工作，设立专门的办事机关，并有足够的得力人员负责检查研究、收集材料、侦查纠察等工作。这比之第一阶段是更加重要了。
    第三，要重新整顿队伍。各部委各单位要分别召开党、团会议，干部会议，群众会议，重新进行反贪污斗争的思想动员。各级领导人在带头作了检讨之后要立即走上阵地指挥作战。过去犯过浪费及公私不分的错误而被误认为贪污者，应按中南局关于浪费的界限和处理办法划清界限，以鼓舞其参加反贪污斗争的热情和积极性。在反对大贪污斗争中尤其要与店员工人的检举运动密切配合，要鼓励他们站稳工人阶级立场，要他们认清自己的前途：要跟着共产党与人民政府走向社会主义，不要跟不法商人走上错误的道路。
    第四，要分化贪污分子。要执行贪污者必办、坦白者从宽、抗拒者重办、悔改者教育改造、检举有功者受奖的政策。对于贪污数量不大情节较轻的国家工作人员，如能彻底坦白，当众悔过，酌情退赃，并保证以后不再犯者，一般可免予法律处分；贪污数字较大的，只要能真正彻底坦白，亦可从宽处理，坦白后又能积极检举别人贪污有功者准予将功折罪，有特殊功绩者，并酌情奖励。对不法工商业者，亦视其情节轻重及坦白与否分别处理，一般可以规定如下：甲、照一般商场惯例送小量回扣者不加处分，送大量回扣和“戴帽子”者以行贿论，但坦白者可从宽处分；国家工作人员吃回扣者要以贪污论。乙、瞒税者，向税务机关坦白后只补交一九五一年所漏税款，可不加处分；不坦白者一经查出，追补税款从解放时算起，并分别处罚。丙、对行贿者如属于拉主顾性质送一般小礼物者不加处罚，送金钱及贵重物品者如能向行贿机关企业彻底坦白者，免予处分，不坦白者要加以处罚，因行贿而取得之非法利润应全部追回。丁、对欺诈行为，如以坏顶好，以假冒真，以低价作高价及修建中之偷工减料等，除追回全部损失外，还要处罚，但能及早坦白者得从轻处理。戊、盗窃国家财产者，全部追回赃物外加重处罚，坦白者从轻处理。己、偷盗国家经济情报者，除追回因取得情报而获得之额外利润，并加重处罚，坦白者亦可从轻处理。
    第五，要研究战略战术。根据各系统各单位的具体情况，定出自己的重点处、重点科、重点对象和大体计划，然后集中力量，收集材料，求得破案。破案的一般方法是搜山围剿（收集材料），跟踪追查（研究材料），重点突破（寻找弱点破大案子），扩张战果（争取大中小贪污分子坦白），通报经验（写报告通报各单位）。
    邓子恢号召全体党员、全体工作人员和全体职工，大家起来积极检举大贪污犯，坚决和大贪污犯作斗争，求得运动的完全胜利。邓子恢警告有贪污行为的国家机关人员和不法工商业者，要他们及早回头，向国家及人民彻底坦白，不要再执迷不悟，自走死路，不要玩弄小聪明，妄图侥幸过关；要知道在目前全国反贪污运动普遍高涨，以后还要一年紧一年，在这种情况下，你不坦白人家坦白，这里不检举那里检举，这里没材料那里有材料，今年不破案明年会破案。在这种情况下，一切贪污不法分子还有什么办法逃出天罗地网，有什么办法侥幸过关？要警告这些人考虑自己的前途，要问问他们是否打算做一个中国人，是否打算永远做一个中国人；如果他们不作此打算那就罢了，如果还要做一个中国人，要永远做中国人，那么他们的出路只有彻底坦白，除此之外再无第二条出路，即使本身死了，但案底未消，以后破案，还要牵累家庭，害子害孙。“若要人不知，除非己勿为”，已经做了贪污犯，要掩盖是掩盖不了的，要逃避也是逃避不了的，唯一出路只有坦白，只有彻底坦白，别的出路是没有的。
