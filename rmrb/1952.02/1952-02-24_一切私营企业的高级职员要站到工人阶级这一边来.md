The struggle to repel the bourgeoisie’s wild attacks has profoundly educated the broad masses of workers and shop assistants, enabling them to deeply understand their glorious position as the leading class, recognize their heavy responsibilities to the country, recognize the bourgeoisie's rampant attacks on the revolutionary camp and the serious consequences caused by these attacks, and realize that if this attack is not repelled, the leadership of the working class will be usurped, and the future of the country will be unimaginable. This new understanding has made them increasingly consciously embark on the path of struggle. Workers and shop assistants who have relatives and friends who are capitalists, who were previously bound by "favor" and "face," are now bravely breaking through these constraints and fighting face-to-face with illegal capitalists. Those who previously linked their personal life and career issues with the illegal operations of capitalists now link them with the success or failure of the working class's struggle and national construction. Those who previously did not dare to raise their heads because they had helped capitalists engage in some illegal activities now realize that this is mainly the crime of the capitalists and have risen up to expose them. Shop assistants in Tianjin formed 276 combat teams, shouting the battle slogans "Jump into the deep mountains to catch tigers" and "Do not stop until victory is won," chasing and encircling major thieves in the industrial and commercial circles day and night. Even on New Year's Eve, they fought all night. They said, "The lightly wounded do not leave the front line, what does this little hardship count for?" Within fifteen days, these combat teams caught 177 "big tigers" who had stolen more than ten billion yuan of national assets. Shop assistants in Shanghai carried out "battlefield shouting" against illegal capitalists, naming names and demanding that those illegal capitalists confess their crimes, making the illegal capitalists feel that there was nowhere to escape, trembling and submitting materials to confess. Workers and shop assistants in Jinan exposed the "offensive and defensive alliance" of illegal capitalists to their faces, severely rebuking their shameless lies, causing many illegal capitalists who had shamelessly denied their crimes at the confession meetings of the Federation of Industry and Commerce to lower their heads and admit their guilt in front of the workers. Sharp class struggle has tempered the broad masses of workers and shop assistants into selfless, brave, and resourceful class fighters. The奸商 [Translator: This literally translates to "adulterous merchant" but it is meant as a derogatory term for unscrupulous capitalists.] Feng Zhongyuan in Harbin extended his vile hand, trembling, and sent 20 million yuan to the shop assistant Yang Hongda, bribing "Old Yang, the expert." The answer he received was: "You are really blind! Even if you take out 200 million yuan, you can't buy me!" In order to find out the "bottom line" of the shop assistants, the奸商s wanted to invite the shop assistants to have a meeting and talk with them. The shop assistants saw through the tricks of these illegal capitalists and replied, "Who do you think you are? You have your trade association, and I have my trade union. I have nothing to talk to you about." The奸商s wanted to please the shop assistants and gave them a lot of meat to eat during the New Year. The shop assistants said, "Eating meat makes the exposure even more energetic!" The奸商s doubled the bonuses for the shop assistants at the end of the year. The shop assistants said, "Bonuses are bonuses, and exposure is exposure. Giving more bonuses can't stop the exposure!" Some奸商s gave the shop assistants new cotton clothes. The shop assistants said, "These clothes were not made by the capitalists, they were made by Chairman Mao. Wearing the clothes makes us even more active in the 'Five-Anti' campaign." In front of these class fighters who consciously struggled to consolidate the leadership of the working class and protect the interests of the state, the奸商s had to be forced to confess their crimes. They said, "You can hide from heaven and earth, but you can't hide from the shop assistants."

However, some illegal capitalists have not completely surrendered and are still unwilling to honestly confess their crimes. They are even still using soft or hard tactics to threaten and entice some workers and shop assistants. Why are these capitalists still able to hold their ground? The main reason is that some workers and shop assistants, especially senior staff, have not bravely stood up and stood firmly on the position of the working class. When everyone is fiercely attacking the illegal capitalists, they lower their heads and frown, considering their own concerns. They sit aside at meetings, not saying a word, at most weakly following others in shouting slogans. Or they just shout "The movement is great," "We all have to stand firm," but never have the courage to stand over. Or they say something that everyone knows or that the capitalists have already confessed, just to deal with their comrades. Then they are afraid of offending the capitalists, and after returning to the shop, they tell their boss about the activities of the trade union. They want to please the boss and "get through the difficulties together" with the boss. They even stay up all night to help the boss make false accounts and plug loopholes, or run around to help the boss hide false accounts. Among these people, some may think that it is better for them to follow the bourgeoisie to seek exorbitant profits, willing to disregard the interests of the country and the people; but in most cases, they are held back by various ideological concerns and cannot move forward. As mentioned above, they may have participated in some illegal activities under the instructions of the capitalists, or have received some bribes, and are afraid that exposing them will cause trouble; or they have relatives and friends who are bosses, and have years of master-apprentice relationship; or they are afraid that the factories and shops will close down, they will lose their jobs, and the factories and shops will be punished, and their income will decrease, and so on. Especially senior staff, they feel that they have worked hard for many years, finally reaching the position of accountant or traveling salesman. Once something goes wrong in the shop or factory, what will happen to their families? It is these various concerns that entangle these people like ropes, making them unable to move.

Nationwide, the workers' and shop assistants' exposure movement is vigorously developing, and the struggle is becoming increasingly fierce. In this sharp class struggle, no individual can be neutral. They must either stand in the ranks of the great working class and fight to repel the bourgeoisie's wild attacks; or continue to attack our great motherland and the working class for the bourgeoisie's dirty illegal profits. There can be no other way. In order to dispel the concerns of these hesitant senior staff, the people's governments in various places have repeatedly solemnly announced that anyone who has participated in the illegal activities of capitalists under the instructions of capitalists will not be held responsible or punished by the government as long as they dare to expose them. The people's government and trade unions have long guaranteed their livelihood and employment issues. Those with difficulties have already been dealt with in practice. Under the people's regime led by the working class, any difficulties can be overcome. The key question is whether they have the determination to fight and which path they want to take.

Staff who cannot break through the emotional ties with capitalists should think about what kind of emotional ties you are taking care of? What will happen if you take care of those kinds of emotional ties? For that bit of emotional ties, can you allow illegal capitalists to destroy the great construction cause of the motherland, and allow them to use tetanus bacteria, pyogenic bacteria, spoiled meat, rotten eggs, and rotten canned goods to poison our volunteer soldiers fighting in the frozen wilderness? Are the future of the motherland, the future of the Party and the working class, not as important as that bit of emotional ties? Staff who want to climb up along the capitalist road should think about how much "climbing" can you really achieve under the arm of the bourgeoisie? Even if you "climb" to the position of "manager," what significance does that have compared to the working class leading the country forward towards socialism? Why don't you straighten your back and become the master of the country, the master of the times, instead of hanging on the tail of the bourgeoisie in a humble and obsequious manner? Isn't this plan for your own future actually ruining your own future? These staff members should quickly decide which path to take: one is to immediately and decisively respond to the call of the Party and the government, and join hands with other workers and shop assistants to launch a merciless counterattack against the bourgeoisie's attacks. This is the bright road. The other path is to stand with the illegal bourgeoisie and continue to attack the revolutionary camp and their own working class. This is to sever ties with the class, sever ties with the working people, and become an enemy of the working class and the working people. This is the path of suicide.

    一切私营企业的高级职员要站到工人阶级这一边来
    宋琤
    反击资产阶级猖狂进攻的斗争，深刻地教育了广大的工人店员群众，使他们深刻地认识了自己光荣的领导阶级的地位，认识了自己对国家所担负的重任，认识了资产阶级对革命阵营的猖狂进攻和这种进攻所造成的严重恶果，认识到如果不打退这种进攻，工人阶级的领导权将会被篡夺，国家的前途将不堪设想。这种新的认识，使他们日益自觉地走上了战斗的道路。和资本家有亲友关系的工人、店员，从前为“人情”、“面皮”所束缚，现在勇敢地打破情面，和不法资本家面对面地斗争起来了。从前把个人的生活、职业问题和不法资本家的营业联系在一起的，现在和工人阶级的斗争和国家建设的成败联系在一起了。从前因为自己帮助资本家干过一些违法活动而不敢抬头的，现在认识到这主要是资方的罪恶，奋起检举了。天津市的店员们组成了二百七十六个战斗小组，高喊着“跳入深山捉老虎”、
    “不到胜利不收兵”的战斗口号，星夜追捕围剿工商界的大盗窃分子。甚至在除夕之夜，也通宵战斗。他们说：“前线轻伤不下火线，咱们吃这点苦算什么。”十五天内，这些战斗小组捉住了盗窃国家资财十亿元以上的“大老虎”一百七十七个。上海市店员对不法资本家实行“阵地喊话”，指名指姓地要那些不法资本家坦白自己的罪行，使不法资本家感到无处可逃，战战兢兢地捧着材料去坦白。济南市的工人店员当面揭发不法资本家的“攻守同盟”，痛斥他们的无耻谰言，使许多在工商联合会的坦白会上无耻抵赖的不法资本家，在工人面前低了头，认了罪。尖锐的阶级斗争，把广大工人店员群众锻炼成了大公无私的勇敢机智的阶级战士。哈尔滨市的奸商冯仲元伸出卑污的手，哆哆嗦嗦地把二千万元送到店员杨洪达面前，贿赂“老杨高高手”。得到的回答是：“你真瞎了眼！你就是拿出两亿元来也买不动我！”奸商为了摸店员的“底”，想请店员们和他们一块开会谈谈。店员们看穿了这些不法资本家的诡计，回答说：“你算谁？你有你的同业公会，我有我的工会，跟你谈不着。”奸商们想讨好店员，过年时给店员吃了很多肉，店员说：“吃了肉检举更有劲！”奸商们在年底加倍给店员分红，店员说：“分红是分红，检举是检举，多给红利挡不住检举！”有的奸商给店员发了新棉衣，店员们说：“这套衣服不是资本家给做的，是毛主席给做的。穿上衣服更要积极‘五反’。”在这些自觉地为巩固工人阶级领导权、为保护国家利益而斗争的阶级战士面前，奸商们不得不被迫坦白认罪。他们说：“瞒天瞒地，瞒不过店堂伙计。”
    但是，一部分不法资本家现在还没有完全低头，还不肯老老实实地坦白自己的罪行。甚至还在用软的或硬的手段，威胁利诱着某些工人店员。这些资本家为什么还能够保守他们的阵地呢？主要原因是目前还有一部分工人店员，特别是高级职员们，没有勇敢地站立起来，站稳工人阶级的立场。在大家都向不法资本家勇猛冲击时，他们却低头皱眉，考虑自己的心事。开会时坐在一边，一言不发，顶多有气无力地跟着别人呼呼口号。或者光喊“运动伟大”，“我们都得站稳立场”，而始终没有勇气站过来。或者是说了一点人所共知的或资本家已经坦白的事情，应付一下自己的同志。回头又怕得罪了资本家，回店以后又把工会的活动告诉了自己的老板。想讨好老板，和老板“共同过关”。甚至通夜不睡，帮助老板做假账、补漏洞，或者东奔西跑地帮助老板隐藏假账。这些人中间，有一些也许是认为跟着资产阶级去图谋暴利对自己更好一点，情愿置国家人民利益于不顾；但更多的情形，却是因为这样那样的一些思想顾虑扯住了自己的腿，不能前进。如前面所说，他们或者曾经在资本家指使下参与过一些不法活动，或多少受过些贿赂，怕检举了以后会惹火烧身；或者是和老板们有亲友关系，有多年的师徒关系；或者是害怕厂店关门，自己失业，厂店受罚，自己收入减少，等等。特别是高级职员，他们觉得熬了多少年，好容易熬到个会计或跑街的地位，一旦店里或厂里出了问题，自己老小一家，如何是好？就是这些各种各样的顾虑，像绳索一样缠绕着这些人，使他们无力举步。
    在全国范围内，工人店员的检举运动正蓬勃开展，斗争日益剧烈。在这场尖锐的阶级斗争中，任何个人都不能中立的。要就是站在伟大的工人阶级的队伍里，为打退资产阶级的猖狂进攻而斗争；要就是为资产阶级的肮脏的非法利润而向我们伟大的祖国和工人阶级继续进攻。此外不能有任何其他道路。为了使这些犹豫不前的高级职员们解除顾虑，各地人民政府曾一再郑重宣布，凡是在资本家指使下参与过资本家的不法活动的，只要大胆检举，政府决不追究责任或给予处分。他们的生活和职业等问题，人民政府和工会更早已做了保证。有困难的，并已做了实际的处理。在以工人阶级为领导的人民政权之下，任何困难都可以克服。问题的关键是自己有没有战斗的决心，究竟要走那一条路。
    对资本家打不破情面的职员们应该想一想，你们所照顾的情面是什么人的情面？照顾那样的情面会发生什么结果？为了那点情面，难道可以任凭不法资本家去破坏祖国的伟大建设事业，任凭他们用破伤风菌、化脓菌，臭肉、臭蛋、臭罐头去毒害我们战斗在冰天雪地中的志愿军战士吗？祖国的前途，党和工人阶级的前途，难道都不如那点情面重要吗？想沿着资本家的道路向上爬的职员应该想想：在资产阶级的手臂之下，你们究竟能有多大的“爬”头？即使“爬”上了个“掌柜”的位置，比起领导国家向社会主义前进的工人阶级来，那又有什么意义呢？为什么自己不挺起腰来去做国家的主人，时代的主人，而要卑躬屈节地吊在资产阶级的尾巴上呢？这种为自己前途的打算，事实上不正是在断送自己的前途吗？这些职员们现在应该赶快决定自己究竟走那条路：一条是立即果断地响应党和政府的号召，和其他工人店员携起手来，向资产阶级的进攻进行无情的反击。这是光明大道。另一条路是和不法资产阶级站在一起，继续向革命阵营和自己的工人阶级实行进攻。这就是自绝于阶级，自绝于劳动人民，和工人阶级、劳动人民为敌。这是自杀的道路。
