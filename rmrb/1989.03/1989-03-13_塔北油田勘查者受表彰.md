Geologists of the Tarim Basin Receive Awards

Our reporter Zeng Kun from Urumqi, March 12th: After a decade of hard work in the Tarim Basin, a group of geologists who discovered a super-large oil and gas field for the country—the Tarim North Oil Field—were awarded yesterday. Representatives of the geologists who made significant contributions were honored with red flowers and medals by the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources.

Minister of Geology and Mineral Resources, Zhu Xun, commented on this achievement, saying: "The Tarim Basin is a large basin with great potential for oil and gas resources. The initial outline of a super-large oil and gas field has already emerged."
