A flash of lightning tore through the night sky, and a nimble eagle soared through the storm. Another flash illuminated the eagle, and the theater erupted in thunderous applause. The performers playing the eagles were two individuals using crutches. The lights brightened, and in an instant, the performers discarded their crutches, performing a somersault from a high platform and dancing to the lively music of a disco. The audience was enthralled, their rhythmic clapping drowning out the music. The performance "Eagle Disco" brought the evening to a climax. The lighting technician turned on all the spotlights, and the camera focused on the excited audience.

On stage, two eagles spread their wings.

Flying over the plains, flying over the mountains...

The curtain fell, and the applause in the theater became even more fervent. From the leaders Hu Qili and Rui Xiongwen sitting in the audience to the disabled friends and ordinary spectators, everyone was moved by the dance that depicted the disabled's resilience and love for life. Many audience members, unable to wipe away their tears of excitement, clapped wildly until the two performers, drenched in sweat, repeatedly came to the front to take their bows.

The performers playing the eagles, Sun Jishu and Chen Yiqian, are farmers from the suburbs of Zibo, Shandong. Both lost a leg above the knee due to accidents. With the help of the local cultural center, they choreographed "Eagle Disco." The performance won first prizes in both performance and creation, as evaluated by experts.

Most of the disabled participants in the performance, like Sun Jishu and his partner, were disabled later in life. They refused to yield to the harsh blows of fate. The young and strong Wu Fengxiang became a high-level paraplegic during the Tangshan earthquake. This time, he sang his own composition, "The Song of the Paraplegic," while seated in a wheelchair. The Shanghai girl, Shan Peili, who loves dancing, became deaf and mute at the age of four due to drug poisoning. Although she cannot hear the music, she feels it with her heart. Her solo dance, "The Silver Eel Girl," told the audience a beautiful legend, showcasing the girl's kindness and purity.

On the evening of March 11, the closing ceremony performance of the disabled artists' showcase inspired all the spectators present. Although the blind performers could not see the smiling faces of the audience, and the deaf performers could not hear the thunderous applause in the theater, they felt the surging enthusiasm of the capital's audience.

　　暴风雨折不断的翅膀
    ——写在残疾人艺术调演闭幕式
    本报记者  赖仁琼
    一道闪电划破夜空，矫健的雄鹰在暴风雨中翱翔。又一道闪电照亮了雄鹰，剧场里骤然爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。原来扮演雄鹰的竟是手柱拐杖的两位残疾人。灯光渐强，刹那间演员扔掉拐杖，一个跟斗从高台跃下，伴随着节奏明快的音乐跳起了迪斯科。观众如醉如狂，有节奏的掌声淹没了音乐。《雄鹰迪斯科》把晚会推向了高潮。灯光师打开了所有的取景灯，摄影师把镜头对准情绪激动的观众。
    舞台上，两只雄鹰展开双翅。
    飞越平原，飞越高山……
    大幕降落，剧场里掌声更加热烈。从坐在观众席上的胡启立、芮杏文等领导人到残疾朋友、普通观众，无不被这个表现身残志坚、热爱生活的残疾人的舞蹈所感染。不少观众顾不得擦去激动的泪花拚命鼓掌，直到两位满脸汗水的演员一次次到前台谢幕。
    雄鹰扮演者孙即树、陈义前是山东淄博市郊的农民，均因事故而单腿高位截肢。他们在地区文化馆的帮助下，编排了《雄鹰迪斯科》。经专家评定获表演、创作两个一等奖。
    参加调演的残疾人中，大多与孙即树他俩一样，是后天致残的。他们不屈服于命运的严酷打击。年轻力壮的吴凤祥在唐山大地震中变成了高位截瘫。这次，他坐在轮椅上演唱了自己创作的《截瘫患者之歌》。酷爱舞蹈的上海姑娘单培丽，４岁时因药物中毒而成为聋哑人，她听不到音乐但却用心灵去感受。独舞《银鳗女》向观众讲述了一个优美的传说，展示了姑娘的善良和纯情。
    ３月１１日晚，残疾人艺术调演闭幕式上的演出鼓舞了所有在场的观众。尽管盲人演员看不见观众的笑脸，聋人演员听不到剧场里一阵又一阵雷鸣般的掌声，但他们感觉到了首都观众沸腾的热情。
