In the minds of foreigners,
You are tea, you are porcelain,
You are Mount Tai, you are the Great Wall,
You are the Hall of Supreme Harmony in Beijing,
You are the Terracotta Army in Xi'an.

In the minds of Chinese people,
You are Pangu, you are Nüwa,
You are Yu the Great, you are the Yellow Emperor,
You are Bai Juyi's "Song of Everlasting Sorrow",
You are Cao Xueqin's "Dream of the Red Chamber."

In the eyes of history,
You are Zhuangzi, you are Confucius,
You are the "Book of Changes," you are the "Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government",
You are the cycle of union and division,
You are disasters and calamities, you are prosperity and peace.

In the eyes of the future,
You are a question mark, you are an exclamation mark,
You are an em dash, you are an ellipsis,
You are half a page of neat and precise regular script,
You are half a page of wild and soaring cursive script.

　　中国
    张雪杉
    在外国人的心目中
    你是茶叶　你是瓷器
    你是泰山　你是长城
    你是北京的太和殿
    你是西安的兵马俑
    在中国人的心目中
    你是盘古　你是女娲
    你是大禹　你是黄帝
    你是白居易的《长恨歌》
    你是曹雪芹的《红楼梦》
    在历史的心目中
    你是庄子　你是孔丘
    你是《易经》　你是《通鉴》
    你是合久必分分久必合
    你是天灾人祸歌舞升平
    在未来的心目中
    你是问号　你是叹号
    你是破折号　你是省略号
    你是半部楷书工整严谨
    你是半部狂草虎跃龙腾
