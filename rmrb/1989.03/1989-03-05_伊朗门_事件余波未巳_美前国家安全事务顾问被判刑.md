Aftermath of the Iran-Contra Affair: Former U.S. National Security Advisor Sentenced

Our reporter Cang Li De reports from Washington, D.C.: The core figure in the Iran-Contra affair, former White House National Security Advisor Robert McFarlane, was sentenced today by a U.S. federal district court to two years of probation and a $20,000 fine.

The 51-year-old retired Marine Corps colonel McFarlane is the first former Reagan administration official in the Iran-Contra criminal case to plead guilty and be sentenced. According to the four charges of concealing the White House's secret support for the Nicaraguan contras from Congress, McFarlane could have been sentenced to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine. However, Chief Judge Aubrey Robinson decided to suspend the sentence, ordering him to serve 200 hours of community service in the community over the next two years. Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh stated that the government did not make any recommendations in this case but refused to disclose the handling process.

McFarlane has been Reagan's advisor throughout the entire Iran-Contra affair and was once the direct superior of another core figure, Colonel North. After this event was exposed, he attempted suicide and pleaded guilty last March. In the current North trial, McFarlane will become a key prosecution witness.

　　“伊朗门”事件余波未巳
    美前国家安全事务顾问被判刑
    本报华盛顿３月３日电  记者仓立德报道：“伊朗门”事件的核心人物之一、前白宫国家安全事务顾问罗伯特·麦克法兰，今天被美国联邦地区法庭判处两年缓刑及２万美元罚款。
    ５１岁的海军陆战队退役中校麦克法兰，是“伊朗门”事件刑事案中第一位表示服罪并被判刑的前里根政府官员。根据向国会隐瞒白宫秘密支持尼加拉瓜反政府武装的４项罪名，麦克法兰本来可被判处一年监禁及１０万美元罚款。但首席法官奥布雷·罗宾森决定予以缓刑，命令他在监外两年中为居民区服务２００小时。独立检察官劳伦斯·沃尔什表示政府未对此案提出任何建议，但拒绝透露处理过程。
    麦克法兰在整个“伊朗门”事件中一直是里根的顾问，并曾是另一核心人物诺思中校的直接上司。这个事件败露后，他曾企图自杀，去年３月表示服罪。在目前开庭审理的诺思案中，麦克法兰将成为关键的起诉证人。
