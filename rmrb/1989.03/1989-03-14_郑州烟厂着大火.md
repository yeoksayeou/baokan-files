In the early morning of March 12, a major fire broke out at the paper storage facility of the Zhengzhou Cigarette Factory. The blaze destroyed 44 storage rooms, reducing 20,000 reams of copperplate paper, lithographic paper, and stored trademarks and decorative paper to ashes. Preliminary estimates indicate that the direct economic loss amounts to 7,720,000 yuan.

Initial investigations at the scene have determined the cause of the fire: The security personnel in the warehouse of the sub-factory violated regulations by using an electric heater, failed to cut off the power supply after leaving, and the heater ignited items in the changing cabinet, leading to the fire.
