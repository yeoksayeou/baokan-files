    The State Council's executive meeting has decided to take special measures to raise 4.5 billion yuan in construction funds to renovate and expand a number of small and medium-sized fertilizer plants and related phosphate and sulfur mines. The goal is to ensure that by 1990, the country's fertilizer production capacity (calculated in standard fertilizer) reaches 100 million tons, marking the first significant increase. After seven months of intense work, these projects have been basically finalized. The State Materials Investment Corporation recently began signing construction contracts with over 100 winning project units in Chengdu.

    To promote agricultural production, the State Council's executive meeting decided last June to focus on increasing fertilizer production capacity by 400 million tons and corresponding phosphate and sulfur mine production within three years. The funds needed for these construction projects will be raised through multiple channels. The central government will cover one-third, while local governments will be responsible for two-thirds, primarily through farmers' investments and township enterprises' equity participation, but without using bank loans. Through central and local joint investments, especially through farmers' investments, it is possible to guide the direction of investments effectively.

    To strengthen the self-discipline mechanism of the investment subject, the investment in these business projects will be implemented on a paid-use basis.

　　筹资４５亿增产化肥
    百余企业中标改造扩建
    本报成都３月３日电  记者鲁牧报道：国务院常务会议确定采取特殊措施，筹集４５亿元基建专项资金，改造、扩建一批中小型化肥厂及配套磷、硫矿山项目，确保１９９０年全国化肥生产能力（按标准化肥计算，下同）达到１亿吨，登上第一个新台阶。经过七个月紧张工作，这些项目已基本落实。国家原材料投资公司日前在成都开始与１００多个中标项目单位草签建设承包协议。
    为发展农业生产，国务院常务会议去年６月决定在３年内集中力量新增４００多万吨化肥和相应的磷、硫矿的生产能力。这批建设项目的所需资金采取多渠道筹集办法，中央负担１／３，地方负责２／３，主要由农民集资和乡镇企业参股，但不得使用银行贷款。通过中央、地方合资特别是向农民集资建设，对引导投资方向具有良好作用。
    为强化投资主体自我约束机制，这批经营性项目投资实行有偿使用。
