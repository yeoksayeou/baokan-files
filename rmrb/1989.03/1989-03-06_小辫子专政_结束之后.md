For a long time, the problems of "difficulty in publishing, buying, and selling books" in China's publishing and distribution sector have often been attributed to the "pigtail dictatorship." This refers to the contracts between the New China Bookstore and publishers, where publishers decide the print run of books, and the "pigtail" clerks at the New China Bookstore counter make the final decision. This phenomenon undoubtedly exists, but this "old problem" is not entirely the fault of the "pigtails." There are many complex reasons behind it.

Today's news about state-owned bookstores pushing for internal reforms has brought new hope to people. The distribution system is implementing the "three releases and one link"—implementing power delegation and contract responsibility to activate state-owned bookstores; opening up wholesale channels to activate the book market; opening up purchase and sales forms and distribution discounts to activate the purchase and sales mechanism; promoting horizontal economic cooperation to develop various publishing and distribution enterprise groups and enterprise conglomerates. If our book publishing and distribution system effectively implements these measures, it is possible to end the era of "pigtail dictatorship."

The current issue is, after the end of the "pigtail dictatorship," what new contradictions will arise, and what problems need to be solved? From the current situation in some regions, the issue of "profit disputes" is serious. Publishers and distributors are competing for profits: publishers keep the best-selling, high-profit books for themselves and push the less popular, lower-profit books to bookstores; bookstores often do not want to send books to remote or inaccessible areas, and so on. This way, the aforementioned "difficulties" may reappear. To resolve these contradictions, in addition to using economic levers, we must further study and address the various shortcomings in the old distribution channels; at the same time, we need to do some ideological work and emphasize a bit of style. Book distribution is different from the general circulation of goods. Even the sale of everyday items emphasizes after-sales "service" and "warranty" for a year or more. Our book distribution, while paying attention to economic benefits, should more emphasize social benefits and practicality, in order to benefit the reform and opening up and the Four Modernizations. We should break through the barriers, share resources, compete fairly, and each show our strengths. Only in this way can the book distribution channels truly become unobstructed.

### “小辫子专政”结束之后……

　　“小辫子专政”结束之后……
    宗杰
    长期以来，我国出版发行方面存在的“出书难、买书难、卖书难”问题，往往归咎于“小辫子专政”，即新华书店和出版社订售书合同，出版社决定书的印数，全由新华书店在柜台上值班的“小辫子”拍板定案。这种现象无疑是有的，但是这个“老大难”，并不全由“小辫子”造成。这里面有着许多复杂的原因。
    今天发表的国营书店抓自身改革的消息，给人们带来了新的希望。发行系统正在推行“三放一联”——推行放权承包，搞活国营书店；放开批发渠道，搞活图书市场；放开购销形式和发行折扣，搞活购销机制；推行横向经济联合，发展各种出版发行企业群体和企业集团。如果我们的图书出版发行系统有效地推行这套办法，可望结束“小辫子专政”的局面。
    现在的问题是，“小辫子专政”结束之后还会出现什么矛盾，还需要解决哪些问题？从目前一些地区的情况来看，“争利”的问题是严重的。出版社与发行部门之间大争其利：出版社把畅销的、利润大的留给自己卖，把不那么畅销的、利润少或较少的推给书店；书店往往不愿把书运往边远地区或交通不便的地区，如此等等。这样一来，就仍然可能重新出现上述提到的那些“难”题。要解决这些矛盾，除了运用经济杠杆之外，恐怕还得进一步研究解决旧的发行渠道上存在的其他种种弊端；同时还要做点思想工作，讲一点风格。图书发行与一般的商品流通毕竟有所不同。销售一般的生活用品尚且讲一点销售之后的“服务”，“保修”一年半载。我们的图书发行在注意经济效益的同时，应更多地讲求社会效益，更注重实效性，以利于改革开放和四化大业。我们应当打破封锁，互通有无，公平竞争，各显神通。这样才能让图书发行渠道真正畅通起来。
