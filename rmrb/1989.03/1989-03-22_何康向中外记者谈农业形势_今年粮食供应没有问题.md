He Kang Discusses Agricultural Situation with Domestic and Foreign Journalists

Grain Supply Will Not Be a Problem This Year

	People's Daily reports: Reporters Zhu Weiqun and Lin Zhijun report: On March 21, Minister of Agriculture He Kang held a press conference at the Great Hall of the People to discuss China's agricultural production situation. He said that although China's grain production decreased by 2.2% last year, the contracted purchase of 50 million tons of grain has been completed by 98%, and the market purchase task has also been completed by nearly 90%. With the existing reserves, there will be no problem with grain supply this year. Although grain is tight, it does not constitute a crisis.

	He Kang believes that in recent years, while agriculture has achieved successes, there have also been setbacks and mistakes. He said that after the bumper harvest in 1984, we were too optimistic about the situation, reduced grain prices, and decreased investment. Coupled with natural disasters, grain and cotton production saw a significant drop in 1985. In 1986 and 1987, agriculture was given renewed attention, and grain and cotton production recovered somewhat, but in 1988, severe natural disasters were encountered again.

	He Kang is optimistic about the current agricultural development trend. He said that last year was the best year for agricultural water conservancy construction in the past 10 years, with an additional 10 million mu of irrigated land and 40 million mu of existing irrigated land improved. The winter grain sowing area increased by 400,000 hectares, and the seedling situation is better than last year.

　　何康向中外记者谈农业形势        
    今年粮食供应没有问题
    本报讯  记者朱维群、凌志军报道：农业部长何康２１日在人民大会堂举行的中外记者招待会上介绍我国农业生产形势时说，虽然我国去年粮食减产２．２％，但合同订购５０００万吨的任务已完成９８％，议价收购任务也完成近９０％；加上库存，今年粮食供应没有问题。粮食虽然紧张，但构不成危机。
    何康认为近几年中农业在取得成就的同时也有波折和失误。他说，１９８４年农业大丰收后我们对形势过于乐观，调减了粮食价格，减少了投入，加上遇到自然灾害，１９８５年粮棉大幅度减产。１９８６、１９８７年对农业重新重视，粮棉生产有所恢复，但１９８８年又遇严重自然灾害。
    何康对当前农业发展势头表示乐观。他说，去年农田水利建设是１０年来最好的一年，新增灌溉面积１０００万亩，原有灌溉面积中有４０００万亩得到改善。越冬粮食播种面积增加４０万公顷，苗情也比去年好。
