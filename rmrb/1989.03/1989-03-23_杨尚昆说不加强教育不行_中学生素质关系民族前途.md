	Yang Shangkun said that education has long been a weak point in our country, and it is imperative that we strengthen it significantly. He praised the establishment of the "Half-Monthly Student Scholarship" as a good deed for enhancing educational efforts.

	The sixth issue of the "Half-Monthly" magazine, to be published on March 25, features a dedication from Yang Shangkun to the recipients of the "Half-Monthly Student Scholarship": "Wish you success." During the dedication, Yang Shangkun also pointed out, "Improving the quality of 50 million middle school students is a major task. Whether they continue their studies or enter the workforce, their cultural, ideological, and work styles will all affect the future of the Chinese nation. Our country's entry into the 21st century will depend on them."

	Yang Shangkun further stated, "Middle school students are the future of our country, and society as a whole should care for them. I also hope that middle school students will not let down the nation and the people, and strive to become talents useful to the country as soon as possible."

　　杨尚昆说不加强教育不行        
    中学生素质关系民族前途
    新华社北京３月２２日电  国家主席杨尚昆提出，教育多年来是我们国家的薄弱环节，不大力加强是不行的。他称赞“半月谈中学生奖学金”的设立，是为加强教育工作“办了一件好事”。
    将于３月２５日出版的《半月谈》杂志第６期，刊登了杨尚昆为“半月谈中学生奖学金”获得者的题词：“祝你成才”。杨尚昆在题词时还指出，“提高５０００万中学生的素质是件大事，不论他们继续升学深造，还是走上工作岗位，他们的文化、思想品质和作风如何，都将关系着中华民族的前途，我们国家进入２１世纪要靠他们了。”
    杨尚昆又说：“中学生是祖国的未来，全社会都应当关怀他们。我也希望中学生不辜负国家和人民的希望，努力使自己尽快成长为国家有用之才。”
