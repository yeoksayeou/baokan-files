Title: Money Should Not Buy Away Childhood Innocence

The surging tide of the commodity economy has been described with hyperbolic phrases like "ten billion people, nine billion merchants." Now, there are reports that even primary school students are being swept up in this wave, which is likely to cast a shadow in the hearts of some of our comrades.

Recalling a rumored saying from Hainan, "A mother scolds her mischievous son: 'If you don't study hard, you'll only be able to become an official!'” Life may not truly reflect this, or perhaps it is a fabrication by some folk humorist. But upon reflection, from the past "study hard to become an official" to today's students who are not ashamed to talk about commerce, this is perhaps a sign of societal progress.

However, developing a socialist planned commodity economy is not about promoting "everyone becoming a merchant," nor is it about turning human relationships into naked monetary transactions. Some of the so-called "commodity economy concepts" that are currently prevalent in society actually run counter to the true spirit of fair competition in business; they are counterfeit goods. If we can conduct proper education in primary and secondary schools about the direction of social development and reform, and about socialist commodity economics, it will be entirely necessary for cultivating the next generation with a modern consciousness. But if we instill a distorted "money worship" into the young minds of children, making them only know how to measure everything with money from a young age, and directly involve them in "commercial activities," then what beautiful childhood innocence will there be left? Such education (mainly family education) is worrisome. After all, we must let children understand that many beautiful things in the world cannot be bought with money.

    不能让金钱买走童心
    锡兵
    商品经济大潮来势汹汹，早有“十亿人民九亿商”的夸张形容，现在又有小学生也被席卷其中的报道，想必这会在我们的一些同志心中投下阴影。
    联想到传闻海南的一则“教子新语”，更觉得很有些值得品味的东西。说是一位母亲教训淘气的儿子：“你再不好好读书，将来只有去当干部了！”生活中未必真有其事，或许是哪位民间的幽默小品作者杜撰出来的。但仔细想来，从过去的学而优则仕到如今的学生也不耻言商，未必不是一种社会的进步。
    然而，发展社会主义有计划的商品经济，决不是要搞什么“全民经商”，更不是要把人与人之间关系变成赤裸裸的金钱交易。目前社会上流行的一些所谓“商品经济观念”，其实恰恰有悖于真正公平竞争的商业精神，是一种冒牌货。如果在中小学校里进行正确的社会发展和改革方向的教育，进行社会主义商品经济的教育，对于培养有现代意识的下一代来说，完全是必要的。但如果把扭曲了的“拜金主义”灌输进幼小的心灵，让孩子们从小就只知用金钱衡量一切，并且直接介入“商业活动”，那还有什么美好的童心可言？这样的教育（主要是家教）是令人忧虑的。毕竟要让孩子们懂得，世界上很多美好的东西是金钱买不到的。
