A significant event in British family life this year is the realization of satellite television broadcasting. Starting from February 5th, the British "Sky Television Company" has been using a European communications satellite to directly broadcast television programs to British households. British television viewers need only install a 60-centimeter diameter satellite dish at home to receive the broadcasts.

The communications satellite was launched into orbit at the end of last year. It has 16 channels, of which the "Sky Television Company" uses six to provide 24-hour satellite television programs to British households. At the same time, the British Satellite Broadcasting Authority decided to launch another television satellite in August this year, which will provide an additional five television channels to British households.

The British television industry has been developing for 53 years, but there are only four national television channels, lagging far behind other European and American countries. With the development of satellite and cable television, it is estimated that by early next year, more than 6 million households in Britain will enjoy the effective services brought by new technology. Two years later, the number of television channels in Britain will jump to more than 40.

Health-Conscious Dietary Changes

The British pay close attention to their daily diet. A survey shows that the dietary habits of British families are changing to become more health-conscious. This change is evident in the shift towards drinking low-fat milk, eating less sugar and butter, and consuming more fish. There is also a trend towards drinking less coffee and tea and more fruit juices.

According to the National Food Survey of Britain, the proportion of vegetables and fruits consumed by British families has increased from 17% in 1965 to 21% in 1987. The sales of frozen vegetables have surged by more than five times, while various fruit juices have increased by tenfold. During the same period, the consumption of whole milk decreased by 5%, sugar by 7%, butter by 6%, coffee by 7%, and tea by 2%. Additionally, fish consumption increased by 4%, poultry by 11%, beef by 3%, while the consumption of mutton and pork has decreased.

The changes in dietary habits among British families reflect a growing emphasis on health and well-being.

　　在英国的家庭里
    卫星电视昼夜开播节目
    今年英国家庭生活中的一件大事是实现了卫星转播电视节目。从二月五日起，英国的“天空电视公司”通过欧洲一颗广播电视卫星，向英国家庭直接播送电视节目。英国电视观众只要在家里安装一个直径为六十厘米的卫星抛物天线，即可收看。
    这颗广播电视卫星是去年年底发射进入轨道的，它拥有十六个频道，英国“天空电视公司”使用其中的六个频道，向英国家庭昼夜提供卫星电视节目。与此同时，英国卫星广播局决定今年八月发射一颗电视卫星，可向英国家庭再提供五个电视频道。
    英国电视事业的发展已经历了五十三个年头，但作为全国性的电视频道只有四个，远远落后于欧美各国。由于卫星电视与有线电视的发展，预计明年初，英国将有六百万个以上的家庭享受新科技带来的有效服务。两年之后英国电视频道会一下跃升为四十个以上。　　　　·王·
    注重健康　改变饮食习惯
    英国人注重日常饮食。据调查表明，英国家庭的饮食习惯正在改变，使之更有益于健康。这种改变的突出表现是正在转向喝低脂肪牛奶，少吃糖与奶油，多吃鱼；少喝咖啡和茶，多喝各种果汁。
    英国全国食物调查报告说，英国家庭所消费的蔬菜与水果比例已由一九六五年的百分之十七增加到一九八七年的百分之二十一。冷冻蔬菜的销售量猛增五倍多，而各种果汁竟增加了十倍。同期，全脂牛奶的消费量减少了百分之五，糖减少百分之七，奶油减少百分之六，咖啡减少百分之七，茶减少百分之二。另外，鱼的消费量增加百分之四，家禽的消费量增加百分之十一，牛肉增加百分之三，而羊肉与猪肉的消费量却有所减少。
    从英国家庭改变饮食习惯，反映出英国人日益注重身体健康。
