Soviet and South African scholars held a three-day secret meeting in London's southern suburbs last week, which is seen as the most significant contact between the two countries in 25 years.

According to a report by the British newspaper "Sunday Telegraph" on March 12, the Soviet delegation was led by Anatoly, the son of former Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Gromyko, and the Director of the Institute of African Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The meeting was chaired by John Killick, the former British Ambassador to Moscow. Both sides sent influential scholars and professors from their respective countries to participate in the talks.

Killick confirmed the meeting in an interview with a "Sunday Telegraph" reporter on the evening of the 11th. He said that Moscow does not want to see the African National Congress develop into a military threat to the South African government.
