The funeral for Liu Le San, a member of the Chinese Communist Party and former advisor to the Financial and Construction Department of the State Bureau of Materials (retired with the treatment of a vice-ministerial level), was held today at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. Liu Le San passed away on February 24, 1989, at the age of 82 due to illness.

Liu Le San was born into a poor peasant family in Shijian County, Hebei Province. In 1926, he joined the revolution and the same year joined the Chinese Communist Party, serving as an underground courier for the Party. During the Anti-Japanese War, he held various positions including the Secretary of the Organization Department of the Taihang District Tainan Sub-district Committee, Secretary of the Organization Department of the Yubei Sub-district Committee, Secretary of the Tax Bureau of the Taiyue Fourth District, and Director of the Economic Bureau.

After the founding of New China, Liu Le San held positions such as Director of the Materials Supply Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Director of the Financial Bureau of the State Economic Commission, and Director of the Financial Bureau of the State Bureau of Materials.

Throughout his long career in revolutionary warfare and socialist construction, Liu Le San remained steadfast in his belief in communism, worked tirelessly, and selflessly dedicated his life to the Party and the people. His passing is a loss to our Party, which has lost a good comrade and a good cadre, and is a loss to the revolutionary cause.

Those who attended Liu Le San's funeral included Yuan Baohua and Liu Suinian, among others.
