Since the beginning of spring, central and southern Taiwan have experienced prolonged drought, leading to water shortages in some major reservoirs. The relevant authorities have decided to implement the first phase of water rationing measures starting today.

According to reports, the Chia-tien Reservoir in the Chia-hsi River system, which originally had a water storage capacity of 1.8 billion tons, now has only 40 million tons left and will be completely dry by the end of April. The water level in the Shihmen Reservoir is currently about 1 meter below the lower limit of 233 meters.

The "Provincial Construction Bureau" of Taiwan has decided to implement the first phase of water rationing measures starting from March 12th in areas including Keelung, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Taichung, Changhua, Chiayi, and Tainan. The supply of non-essential water for swimming pools, fountains, and car washing will be stopped.

Taipei City, however, is not facing water shortages. Officials from the Feitsui Reservoir stated that Taipei's daily water usage is approximately 170 million tons, and the current water storage in the Feitsui Reservoir is as high as 16 billion tons.

　　台湾中南部大旱  当局已决定限水
    本报香港３月１２日电  入春以来，台湾中南部地区久旱不雨，部分大水库出现水荒。有关当局决定从今日起实施第一阶段限水措施。
    据报道，台湾属于大甲溪系统的基德水库，蓄水量原为１．８亿吨，目前只剩４０００多万吨，至４月底将无水可用。石门水库目前水位已比下限２３３米还低约１米。
    台湾“省建设厅”决定，从本月１２日起，在基隆、桃园、新竹、苗栗、台中、彰化、嘉上、台南等地实施第一阶段限水措施。游泳池、喷水池、洗车等非生活用水停止供应。
    台北市则无缺水之虑。翡翠水库官员表示，台北用水量每日约１７０万吨，目前翡翠水库蓄水量高达１６０亿吨。
