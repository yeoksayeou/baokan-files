Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 22nd.

As an important measure to implement the "rectification and rectification" policy, the nationwide tax, financial, and price inspections have achieved significant results. Today, at the national "three inspections" work conference held in Wuhan, it was revealed that from the beginning of 1988 to the end of January this year, a total of 12.31 billion yuan in various violations were uncovered nationwide, an increase of 29.5% compared to 1988.

According to reports, this round of "three inspections" was on a larger scale than in previous years. While strengthening inspection forces, various regions and departments also invited representatives from the National People's Congress, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, democratic parties, and mass organizations to participate in key inspections. However, in handling the violations that were uncovered, there was a tendency to be lenient: strict with small cases but lenient with large ones; strict with lower-level officials but lenient with higher-level ones. Especially regarding the collection of violation funds, the situation was not ideal. By the end of January, the national average collection rate for funds that should have been collected was 76.2%, lower than the collection rates of previous years.

In a written speech, Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Wang Bingshan pointed out that it is necessary to further strengthen and improve the large-scale inspection work. It is essential to seriously investigate and deal with various illegal and disciplinary violations, ensuring that all violation funds are collected. At the same time, it is crucial to strictly adhere to policies and continuously improve the quality of inspections to achieve greater results.

### 财税物价大检查有进展  已查出违纪金额１２３亿

　　财税物价大检查有进展        
    已查出违纪金额１２３亿
    新华社武汉３月２２日电  （记者施勇峰）作为贯彻“治理、整顿”方针的一项重要措施，全国税收、财务、物价大检查已取得明显成效。今天在武汉召开的全国“三查”工作会议披露，从１９８８年年初到今年１月底，全国共查出各种违纪金额１２３．１亿元，比１９８８年度增加２９．５％。
    据介绍，这次“三查”工作规模大于往年，各地区、各部门在加强检查力量的同时，还邀请人大、政协、民主党派和群众团体参加了重点检查，但对查出的违纪问题在处理上失之过宽：对小的严，对大的宽；对下面严，对上面宽。特别是违纪金额收缴入库情况不太理想，到１月底，全国应缴金额平均入库率为７６．２％，低于往年的入库率。
    国务委员兼财政部长王丙乾在书面讲话中指出，要进一步加强和改进大检查工作，既要认真查处各种违法乱纪行为，把各项违纪金额全部收缴上来，又要严格掌握政策，不断提高检查质量，取得更大的效果。
