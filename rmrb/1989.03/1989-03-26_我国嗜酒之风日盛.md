The March 10th edition of the "Life Daily" reported: According to relevant departments, China has over 5,000 large and small breweries, producing 8 million tons of alcohol annually. There are 160 million alcohol consumers nationwide. The alcohol industry consumes 30 million tons of grain each year, and the annual expenditure on alcohol at banquets amounts to 13 billion yuan.

These figures clearly indicate that China is not only a "drinking nation" but can be considered a "super drinking nation." Traditionally known as the top "drinking nation," the Soviet Union has only a fraction of the number of alcohol consumers compared to China. Moreover, the average amount of alcohol consumed per person in China each year is 7.5 times higher than in Germany, which is known as the "beer nation."

During the Tang and Song dynasties, taverns were ubiquitous in the marketplaces. From scholars to common people, everyone enjoyed drinking. Today, the drinking culture in China is more prevalent than ever before. Some people drink to strengthen their bodies, others drink to drown their sorrows, but most seek stimulation. Across the country, it is common to see scenes of drinking games and toasting. Alcohol also plays the role of a "friendship ambassador" and a "public relations officer." Many factory directors and managers, in addition to being good at speaking and calculating, must also be able to drink. Often, before discussing business, they will drink a few rounds.

Currently, this drinking culture has also spread to the younger generation. A survey of five primary and secondary schools in Shanghai revealed that about half of the male students drink alcohol, with 32% drinking regularly.

### 我国嗜酒之风日盛

　　我国嗜酒之风日盛
    ３月１０日《生活报》报道：据有关部门统计，我国有大小酒厂５０００家，年产酒８００万吨，全国有酒徒１．６亿，全国酿酒每年耗粮３００万吨，每年酒宴消费的酒钱达１３０亿之多。
    这一组数字，清楚地表明我国不但是“饮酒大国”，简直可以称之“饮酒超级大国”了。因为一向被称为头号“饮酒大国”的苏联，其酒徒人数只有中国的零头，而中国人每年平均饮下的酒精，比号称“啤酒大国”的德国，高出７．５倍。
    唐宋之世，酒肆遍及市井。上至士大夫，下至黎民百姓，无不以嗜酒为乐。时至今日，中国人饮风之盛，更是前无古人的。有人以酒强身，有人借酒消愁，但更多的人是寻求所谓刺激。神州大地，经常可以看到猜拳敬酒的场面。酒还扮演了“友谊大使”及“公关小姐”的角色。不少厂长、经理，除了要能说会算，还要能喝。每每商谈生意之前，先要喝几杯。
    现时，这股嗜酒的风气已经传染给了下一代。上海市对五所中小学调查，发觉约有一半以上男生会饮酒，其中，经常饮酒的有３２％。
