Some Western energy experts have recently made predictions about the future of the global oil market. Although their opinions vary, they all agree that oil will remain a crucial energy source in the 21st century. Oil prices in the 1990s and the early 21st century are expected to rise steadily.

Some oil economists here estimate that oil prices in the 1990s will remain between $15 and $20 per barrel.

By the first decade of the next century, oil prices are expected to continue rising, potentially reaching $25 per barrel.
