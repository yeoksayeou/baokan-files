Reading some economics is naturally meant for college students who are not majoring in economics. In non-economic fields, such as political issues, social issues, and cultural issues, it seems that they have nothing to do with economics. However, upon deeper investigation, one often finds the initial economic motives. At this point, you need to borrow the perspective of economics.

For example, why did New China once choose the "Soviet model"? This seems to be a topic in political science or history. The usual explanations focus on ideology, such as the misunderstanding of Marxist theory and the influence of feudalism. These explanations have some merit, but they overlook a more profound reason. An economist analyzed it this way: "When developing countries start industrialization, the industrialization of developed countries has already entered the modern stage. This determines that one cannot follow the old path of starting with light industry and crawling slowly, but must proceed with both light and heavy industries, and even with heavy industry first... Do you want to solve the contradiction between industrialization and accumulation? Do you want to use limited accumulation on the cutting edge? Do you want to achieve overtaking? Obviously, establishing a highly centralized planned system is a relatively realistic historical choice for mobilizing various social resources." From economic overtaking to planned economy to centralized politics, the historical development presents a more thorough trajectory than the temporary leftist tendency of the leaders. You have to admire the political and historical analysis of economics.

Take, for example, the recent passive and sluggish national sentiment. Some students who are good at cultural criticism blame it as "national inferiority" and do not say another word. However, one scholar did not satisfy himself with merely making an abstract value criticism and moral condemnation, but instead dug out the economic motives behind this national sentiment: "Fire, let it burn, after all, it's not my forest. Collision, let it collide, after all, it's not my train... The 'large' and 'complete' national ownership system has dissolved 'me.' Who is the owner of this property, in economic and legal terms, there is only one—the various levels and types of government departments. While enterprise employees have only political or moral ownership status... This has caused tens of millions of employees to invest their monetary income purely into consumption. While the distorted consumption structure will cause the deterioration of people's will, pursuing pleasure. The lack of enthusiasm of the people for asset appreciation will inevitably lead to a lack of enthusiasm for the national economy." In the midst of cultural criticism, this scholar is truly insightful, diagnosing the root cause of "national inferiority"—the old economic system, and thus suggesting a prescription—improving national concern for assets through system reform.

Scientist Newton once said: "The world is written in the language of mathematics." Perhaps we can imitate a sentence: Modern society is written in the language of economics. The fundamental difference between modern society and traditional society is that the market replaces administrative power or religion, ethics as the new social pivot, the market calls for science, democracy, and the rule of law, supporting an entire modern civilization. Knowing some economics is equivalent to mastering the map of the modern society labyrinth. China's traditional culture, some people call it "ethical culture" or "omnipotent political culture." This traditional culture permeates our education and academia, manifesting as the use of certain abstract political slogans and ethical beliefs as the sole "language" to explain political, social, and cultural phenomena—this language sounds profound, but when analyzing real social contradictions and seeking reform paths, it often seems empty and powerless. Adding a bit of economic perspective might save us from the poverty of our thinking methods and scientific rationality. Economics advocates facing reality with reason rather than emotion. It opposes deducing the entire world from some abstract sacred cultural values, but rather derives certain immutable laws from the economic relationships of the entire world. It is a thorough historicalism. In the early days of industrial civilization, some small producers criticized the evils brought by industrialization from an ethical and aesthetic standpoint; while the British economist Ricardo calmly pointed out: human development can only be based on the development of productive forces, and for the development of productive forces, everything is worth it. Marx once praised Ricardo's scientific honesty and courage. In his time, Marx, in order to dissect the changing German society, resolutely turned from jurisprudence and philosophy to economics. Students who aspire to grasp China's reform from a scientific perspective might gain some enlightenment from this.

　　现代社会用经济的语言写成        
    ——大学生读点经济学的必要性
    本报记者  祝华新
    读点经济学，自然是对非经济学专业的大学生而言的。在非经济领域，比如说政治问题、社会问题、文化问题，似乎都与经济无关，但是深入探究下去，往往能找到初始的经济动因。这时，你就得借鉴经济学的视角了。
    比如说，为什么新中国一度选择了“苏联模式”？这似乎是一个政治学或者历史学的课题。通常的解释着眼于意识形态，比如对马克思学说的误解，封建主义的影响。这些解释都有一定道理，但忽略了一个更深刻的原因。一位经济学家是这样分析的：“当发展中国家工业化起步时，发达国家工业化已进入近代或现代阶段，这就决定了不能再走人家老路，从轻工业起步，缓慢地爬行，而要轻重并进，甚至要以重工业先行……你要解决工业化和积累的矛盾吗？你要把有限的积累用在刀刃上吗？你要实现赶超吗？显然，建立高度集中的计划体制，不失为动员社会各种资源的一种较现实的历史选择。”从经济赶超到计划经济到集权政治，历史发展呈现出比领导人一时左倾更为透彻的轨迹，你不得不佩服经济学的这番政治分析和历史分析。
    再比如说，对近年来消极、疲软的国民心态，一些擅长于文化批判的同学斥之为“国民劣根性”，便不再置一词。偏偏有一位学者没有满足于仅仅作一番抽象的价值批判和道德谴责，而是挖掘出这种国民心态背后的经济动因：“着火，着它的去，反正烧的不是我的森林。撞车，撞它的去，反正撞的不是我的列车……‘大’而‘全’的全民所有制，把‘我’融化了，究竟谁是这资产的所有者，在经济上和法律上只有一个——各级各类政府部门。而企业职工只有政治上或道义上的主人翁地位……这就造成了亿万职工货币收入单纯地投入消费。而畸形的消费结构则会造成人的意志衰退，追求享乐。人民群众对资产增殖缺乏热情，必然对国民经济缺乏热情。”在一片文化批判声中，这位学者可谓独具慧眼，诊断出“国民劣根性”的病根——旧的经济体制，从而提示了一味药方——通过体制改革提高国民对资产的关切度。
    科学家牛顿说过：“世界是用数学的语言写成的。”也许我们可以模仿一句：现代社会是用经济的语言写成的。现代社会与传统社会的一个根本区别，就是市场取代行政权力或宗教、伦理成为新的社会枢纽，市场呼唤科学、民主、法制，托起整整一座现代文明。懂点经济学，就等于掌握了现代社会迷宫的线路图。中国的传统文化，有人称之为“伦理型文化”或“全能政治型文化”。这种传统文化渗透到我们的教育和学术中，表现为把某些抽象的政治口号和伦理信念作为解释政治、社会和文化现象的唯一“语言”——这种语言听起来虽然深刻，但在剖析现实的社会矛盾、探寻改革出路时常常显得空泛无力。增加一点经济学的视角，也许能救助我们思维方法和科学理性的贫乏。经济学主张用理智而不是感情来面对现实，它反对以某些抽象的神圣的文化价值演绎出整个世界，而是从整个世界的经济关系中推导出某些不以人的意志为转移的规律，它是一种彻底的历史主义。在工业文明初兴时，一些小生产者站在伦理的和审美的立场批判工业化带来的邪恶；而英国经济学家李嘉图则冷静地指出：人的发展只能以生产力的发展为基础，为了发展生产力，一切应在所不惜。马克思曾称赞李嘉图科学的诚实和勇气。当年马克思为了解剖变革中的德国社会，毅然从法学和哲学转向经济学。有志于从科学上把握中国改革的学子，也许能从中得到某种启迪。
