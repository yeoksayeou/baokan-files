The Jutland Peninsula is the largest and most enchanting piece of land in Denmark proper.

Summer days in the Nordic region are long. The sun rises, aligning perfectly with the windmills standing tall in the distance. Golden sunlight bathes the green fields, the quaint villages with red-tiled roofs, and the crisscrossing roads, casting an enchanting hue over this land.

The car speeds along the long dike on the west coast heading south. Just a few minutes ago, the picturesque countryside has given way to a desolate landscape. Sand dunes leap before one's eyes, stretching endlessly. Wild grasses grow on the dunes, and there are scattered wildflowers. In the more level and expansive areas, one can occasionally see grazing cattle and sheep and thatched cottages.

I have been sitting by the window the whole time, gradually feeling drowsy from the monotonous scenery. Just then, a patch of deep red suddenly appears in the distance, as if a cloud of color has fallen from the sky to the earth. Then another patch, and another, until the green is completely replaced by a sea of red, glowing brightly under the sunlight, red as fire.

"What is that?" I asked in surprise.

"Rhododendron," someone replied.

"Rhododendron! Ah, so this is the special wild grass that Danish friends have told me about!"

In ancient times, Jutland was a barren and desolate land. When the ancestors of the Danes appeared here, there were only marshes and rhododendron wilderness.

In the 18th century, the Danish poet Børge Riisbrigh wrote about the rhododendron wilderness:

Brown rhododendron fields are my home,
Happy childhood burns away the wilderness's bitterness;
I walk lightly on the yellow sand,
The rolling sand dunes are my childhood companions.

I find the flowerless wilderness incredibly beautiful,
The brown rhododendron wilderness is like the Garden of Eden;
I hope one day to rest there quietly,
Joining the ranks of my ancestors.

The romantic poet compared the wilderness to the Garden of Eden, but his ancestors could not survive on the wilderness. They toiled day and night, cultivating the land, determined to transform the wilderness. In spring, they sowed seeds, along with hope. But the crops did not grow, and instead, red rhododendrons spread everywhere. Rhododendrons have an astonishing vitality. They thrive on sandy soil and rocky heaps, and where they grow, it is difficult for other plants to survive. Year after year, the rhododendrons, with their stubborn nature, repeatedly dashed the beautiful hopes that people had painstakingly woven. The people were enraged and vowed to settle the score with this unruly wild grass, thus a peculiar battle between humans and grass unfolded on the Jutland Peninsula. A group of determined people and a tenacious grass both fought for survival in a life-or-death struggle...

Last time in Jutland, before reaching the west coast, I had not seen any rhododendron grass. On the east coast, in the central part of the peninsula, and in other places, there were only boundless fields, hillsides full of cattle and sheep, and elegant windmills that made up the unique rural landscape of Jutland. In the Middle Ages, Jutland was already one of Europe's granaries, and today it remains an important base for Denmark's agriculture and livestock industry, which has a significant export share. At that time, I thought that rhododendrons had long since disappeared!

However, on the west coast, I saw it. It was still growing vividly and vibrantly, just as described in the legends. Perhaps it was to provide a tangible note for history; perhaps it was still to showcase its indomitable spirit.

The rhododendron grassland outside the car window continues to stretch on. I must say that the indomitable spirit and tenacious vitality of the rhododendron are truly worthy of admiration.

　　石楠，不屈的象征
    士平
    日德兰半岛是丹麦本土最大、最神奇的一块土地。
    北欧的夏天日子长。太阳升起来了，与挺立在远处的风车恰好齐腰。金黄色的阳光洒落在绿色的田野、青砖红瓦的村庄和纵横交错的公路，给这块大地抹上一层迷人的色彩。
    汽车顺着西海岸的长堤向南奔驰。几分钟前满目清秀的田园风光换成荒芜的景色。沙丘在眼前跳跃着，连绵不尽。沙丘上下，野草丛生，也有星星点点的野花。在较为平坦舒展的地方，偶尔能看到正在吃草的牛羊和茅屋。
    我一直靠窗坐着，渐渐因单调乏味而感觉有些倦意，恰在这时，远处绿色中蓦然地现出一片深红色，宛如天上彩云落在人间，接着又是一片，又是一片，终于把绿色完全挤走，只剩下一片红，在阳光的照耀下，红得耀眼，红得像火。
    “那是什么？”我惊讶地问。
    “石楠。”有人回答。
    “石楠！啊，这就是石楠么！这就是丹麦朋友说起过的那种特殊的野草么！
    古时，日德兰是块贫瘠荒芜的土地。丹麦人的祖先在这里出现的时候，那里只有沼泽和石楠荒原。
    １８世纪丹麦诗人卜里池曾对石楠荒原作过这样的描绘：
    棕色的石楠原野是我的家，
    快乐的童年烧掉荒原的苦闷；
    我轻步走在黄色的沙土上，
    起伏的沙堆是整个童年的伙伴。
    我觉得无花的原野美丽无比，
    棕色的石楠荒原宛如伊甸园；
    我希望有一天静眠在那里，
    加入到祖先的行列中间。
    浪漫的诗人把荒原比作伊甸园，但是他的祖先无法靠荒原生存。他们披星戴月，开垦田地，决心改造荒原。春天他们播下种子，也播下希望。谁知庄稼不长，却铺天盖地长满了红红的石楠。石楠具有令人赞叹的生命力。它喜欢生长在沙土上，石砾堆里，有它的地方，就很难有其他植物。年复一年，石楠以它倔强的性格一次又一次破灭人们千辛万苦编织起来的美好希望。他们被激怒了，发誓要和这种桀骜不驯的野草决一雌雄，于是在日德兰半岛上出现过一场奇特的人草之战。一群意志坚定的人和一种不甘屈从的草同样为了生存展开了殊死的较量……
    上次在日德兰，到西海岸之前我一直没有看到石楠草。在东海岸、在半岛中部和其他地方到处都是无垠的田野、满坡的牛羊和优雅的风车构成的日德兰特殊田园风光。在中世纪，日德兰就已是欧洲的一个粮仓，而今也依然是出口占很大比重的丹麦农业和畜牧业的一个重要基地。我那时还以为石楠早已绝迹了呢！
    然而，在西海岸我见到了它。它依然像传说的那样红红火火地生长着。也许那是为了给历史作一个实物注脚；也许那依然是为了展现它不屈的性格。
    车窗外石楠草原仍在延伸，我得说石楠不屈的性格和顽强的生命力确实值得赞美。
