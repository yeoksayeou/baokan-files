	Baker Proposes Idea for Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations
	People's Daily, Washington, March 15th — Correspondent Zhang Qixun reports: U.S. Secretary of State Baker today told Congress that direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization could ultimately become a reasonable way to achieve Middle East peace. This is the view the Secretary of State has expressed in recent days regarding the Middle East issue, indicating that the U.S. government's Middle East policy has undergone new changes.

	Baker told senators of the Senate Appropriations Committee that if Israelis and Palestinians do not engage in direct negotiations, peace will not be achieved. To advance Middle East peace, we should not absolutely rule out considering other avenues, but should explore all reasonable methods.

	Israeli Foreign Minister Arens, who is continuing his three-day visit to Washington, expressed strong dissatisfaction with Baker's views. In a meeting with editors and reporters of the Washington Post, he said, "I saw this statement, and I am deeply disappointed."

　　贝克提出以巴谈判设想
    本报华盛顿３月１５日电  记者张启昕报道：美国国务卿贝克今天对国会说，以色列和巴勒斯坦解放组织的直接谈判可能最终成为实现中东和平的一种合理方式。这是这位国务卿近两天来在谈到中东问题时阐述的观点，表明美国政府的中东政策有了新的变化。
    贝克对参议院拨款委员会的参议员说，如果以色列人和巴勒斯坦人不进行直接谈判，和平是得不到的。为了推进中东和平，我们不应绝对地排斥考虑其他途径，而应该探索所有合理的方式。
    继续在华盛顿进行三天访问的以色列外长阿伦斯对贝克的看法十分不满，他在会见《华盛顿邮报》的编辑和记者时说，我看到这一发言，深感失望。
