The Soviet Union will restore the original name of Andropov City in the Russian Republic to Ryazan, according to the wishes of the broad masses, as reported by Tass.

Ryazan was renamed Andropov City in February 1984 following the death of Andropov, who became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union after Brezhnev's death in 1982.

Observers here believe that the restoration of Ryazan's name does not indicate any change in the Soviet leadership's evaluation of Andropov. It is reported that people have also requested the restoration of the original names of cities named after famous individuals, such as Gorky and Kuybyshev.

　　苏将安德罗波夫市恢复原名
    新华社莫斯科３月３日电  据塔斯社报道，根据广大群众要求，苏联决定把俄罗斯共和国的安德罗波夫市恢复其原来名称——雷宾斯克市。
    雷宾斯克市是在１９８４年２月苏共中央总书记安德罗波夫逝世后改名的。安德罗波夫１９８２年在勃列日涅夫逝世后当选为苏共中央总书记。
    这里的观察家们认为，苏联恢复雷宾斯克市名称并不意味着苏联领导对安德罗波夫的评价有什么改变。据报道，人们还要求把一些名人命名的城市，如像高尔基、古比雪夫这样城市也恢复其原来的名称。
