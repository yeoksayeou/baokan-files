General Dong Jiyuan has passed away! The news of his departure is deeply mourned. He dedicated his life to the prosperity and strength of our country, and his contributions are immeasurable. As a national elite, his legacy will endure.

In remembrance of General Dong Jiyuan, I have written this article to express my sorrow.

	Anti-Japanese Patriot General

General Dong Jiyuan was born in 1899 in Hujin County, Shanxi Province, into a poor peasant family. At that time, the Qing Dynasty was in its final years, the government was corrupt, and the people were suffering. His maternal grandfather was executed for leading a local Boxer uprising, burning churches, and killing foreigners. Dong was raised by his maternal grandmother, grew up to be studious, and read extensively in classical literature. Later, driven by the desire to "strengthen the country and the military," he abandoned his studies and joined the military, determined to become a patriotic soldier.

He began his military career in 1924, fighting in various battles and changing units frequently. After the Northern Expedition began, he joined the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army as the commander of an advance column, fighting in Henan and Anhui, and earning numerous battle merits. He was later promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and deputy regiment commander. However, because his unit was not part of Chiang Kai-shek's personal forces, it was disbanded, making his dream of strengthening the country and the military seem unattainable. He had planned to go to Shanghai to seek another path but ended up in dire straits. At that time, General Fu Zuoyi, who was the commander of the Tianjin Special City Garrison, was expanding his forces. Dong admired General Fu and sold his belongings to travel to Tianjin. After being examined by General Fu, he was appointed as an additional captain. He did not mind the low rank and position, working diligently and earning General Fu's praise, and was soon promoted to the rank of major.

Under General Fu Zuoyi's command, he led his troops effectively and later held positions such as deputy regiment commander and regiment commander. Subsequently, he returned to Suiyuan with General Fu. At that time, bandits were rampant, causing harm to the people. Therefore, the first major task upon returning to Suiyuan was to pacify the countryside and suppress bandits. In clearing out the bandits, he did not accept bribes or yield to corruption, nor was he tempted by the enemy's schemes. He firmly punished the bandit leaders, upheld justice, and removed the harm to the people, significantly improving social order in the five eastern counties of Suiyuan.

After the "September 18 Incident," he saw that large areas of Northeast China had fallen into enemy hands, and millions of compatriots were suffering under Japanese aggression. He felt that "the fate of the nation rests with every individual," and as a Chinese soldier, it was his duty to defend the country. He submitted a petition to General Fu Zuoyi to join the fight against Japan. In early 1933, General Fu led the 59th Army from Suiyuan to the east to fight against Japan. Dong Jiyuan's 218th Brigade was the vanguard. At that time, the Japanese had captured Gubeikou, and Beijing was in danger. General Fu was ordered to lead his troops to Changping and conduct ambushes in the Huairou area. Dong Jiyuan's regiment fought bravely in the battle, repelling the Japanese seven times in one day. The entire army took General Fu's slogan, "Rather be a war hero than a traitor," as their battle cry, vowing to defend the country to the death, winning the first victory, and receiving praise from newspapers across the country, earning the title of "Great Wall Resistance."

After the Great Wall Resistance, Dong Jiyuan was promoted to the rank of major general and brigade commander of the 218th Brigade. Subsequently, he led his troops to participate in the famous "Suiyuan Resistance," a battle that defeated the Japanese and puppet forces and recaptured lost territory. This battle was divided into two phases. Under General Fu Zuoyi's meticulous planning, the first phase was led by Brigade Commander Dong Jiyuan and Division Commander Peng Yubin, who organized and commanded the Red Gelitu Battle. Red Gelitu, then part of Taolin County, Suiyuan (now part of the right rear banner of Inner Mongolia), was a strategic stronghold that the Japanese and puppet forces had to capture and that the anti-Japanese forces had to defend. With the cooperation and assistance of local Mongolian military and civilians, they fought for seven days and nights, destroying the command posts of Japanese General Tanaka Ryoki and puppet leader Wang Ying. They killed or wounded over 1,700 enemy and puppet soldiers, captured over 300 puppet soldiers, including the Japanese radio station chief Hachimori Reiki, shot down one enemy plane, and seized one wireless radio, several cars, over 100 horses, and a codebook and contact list for Japanese and puppet radio stations in various places. The Red Gelitu Battle cleared the way for the capture of Bailingmiao and paved the way for victory. The next phase was led by Division Commanders Sun Changsheng and Sun Lanfeng, who launched a fierce attack on Bailingmiao, which was occupied by the Japanese and puppet forces. They killed nearly a thousand enemy and puppet soldiers, captured over 400, seized three infantry guns, six mortars, over 800 rifles, three radios, five cars, and over 200 horses. The great victory of the Suiyuan Resistance brought joy to the nation, boosting the morale of the entire nation to resist. Chairman Mao Zedong sent Comrade Nan Hanqing with a personal letter of congratulations and a silk banner embroidered with the words "Defend the Country" to Suiyuan to express his warm regards. Chairman Mao Zedong highly praised the "Suiyuan Resistance," calling it "the first voice of national resistance."

After the outbreak of the "July 7 Incident," the invading Japanese forces launched a large-scale attack, and the nation rose up to resist. The Eighth Route Army marched from Shaanxi to the front lines in North China. In the famous Battle of Pingxingguan, General Dong Jiyuan led the 218th Brigade, following General Fu Zuoyi's orders, to rush to Pingxingguan from Yangfangkou. They braved heavy rain, rushed through the mountains, and successfully completed their mission. The attack by Fu Zuoyi's forces played a supporting role in the victory at Pingxingguan.

Here, let's talk more about General Dong Jiyuan's leadership in the Battle of Xinkou. This was a major battle in the early stages of the resistance in North China, with a large scale and long duration. The Japanese and puppet forces deployed 60,000 to 70,000 troops, while the Nationalist forces deployed over 100,000. The battle lasted 23 days, with tens of thousands of casualties on both sides. In the Battle of Xinkou, Dong Jiyuan's brigade was ordered to attack the command post of the Japanese front line led by General Tanaka and destroy the enemy's artillery positions. He carefully planned the battle, personally led the front-line troops, and was unfortunately wounded in the left arm during the battle. The wound bled profusely, but he continued to command the battle. Later, because the shrapnel was not removed and became infected, his arm swelled, but he did not report to the headquarters and continued to fight on the front line. General Fu Zuoyi learned of his injury and ordered Colonel Sun Lanfeng of the 211th Brigade to quickly take over his command. He said, "At this critical moment, how can I retreat because of a minor injury?" He then commanded the battle with Colonel Sun, completing the mission successfully, seizing many war trophies from the Japanese 5th Division, the 32nd Brigade of the Mengjiang Army led by Tojo Hideki, and the 12th Garrison Brigade led by General Suzuki. He was awarded by the headquarters. After the Battle of Xinkou, General Fu Zuoyi ordered him to go to Taiyuan to treat his arm injury. The next day after having the shrapnel removed in the hospital, he had the doctor bring medicine and rushed back to Xinkou. Because of his outstanding performance in the battle, he was promoted to the rank of major general and commander of the 101st Division.

During his tenure as division commander, he led his troops to participate in the battles of Baotou, Suiyuan, and Wuyuan, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese and earning numerous merits. He was then promoted to the rank of commander of the 4th Provisional Army and later to the commander of the 35th Army. Before Japan's surrender, he served as the director of the Political Department of the 12th War Zone and the deputy commander-in-chief of the Jin-Shan-Sui Border Region.

From the Great Wall Resistance to Japan's surrender, over 12 years, General Dong Jiyuan led his troops to resolutely resist the enemy, defend the country, and achieve outstanding merits, earning the respect of the people and being a famous patriot and resistance hero.

	Suiyuan Uprising

On September 19, 1949, on the eve of the liberation of mainland China, General Dong Jiyuan led his troops to uprising in Suiyuan, successfully realizing Chairman Mao Zedong's proposal of the "Suiyuan Model." This was a great contribution he made to the liberation of our country.

The negotiations for the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan were personally led by Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. Initially, Comrade He Long presided over the negotiations, and later, when Suiyuan was placed under the jurisdiction of the North China Region, Comrade Nie Rongzhen and I took over. At that time, I was the first secretary of the North China Bureau and the political commissar of the North China Military Region. Therefore, I participated in the entire process of negotiations, uprising, and reorganization.

The Nationalist forces in Suiyuan were under the jurisdiction of the "North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters," with one army headquarters, eight divisions, and eight brigades. Dong Jiyuan was the commander of the Suiyuan Command Post of the "North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters," as well as the governor and security commander of Suiyuan Province. On January 21, General Fu Zuoyi announced that the Nationalist forces in Beijing would accept reorganization, and Beijing was peacefully liberated. General Dong Jiyuan learned of this news and flew to Beijing the next day to visit General Fu, clearly expressing his intention to follow General Fu's path of peace. General Fu told him, "The issue of Suiyuan will be decided after I see Chairman Mao."

On February 23, Chairman Mao Zedong met with Generals Fu Zuoyi and Deng Baoshan in Xibaipo and proposed the "Suiyuan Model," that is, to draw a dividing line between the two armies, maintain the status quo, and let General Dong Jiyuan do the internal work, waiting for the conditions to be ripe for the uprising. On March 23, Chairman Mao Zedong further elaborated on the "Suiyuan Model" in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which was to intentionally retain a part of the Nationalist forces, make a temporary concession, and after a considerable period of time, reorganize this part of the forces into the People's Liberation Army according to the system of the People's Liberation Army.

Following the guidelines and principles proposed by Chairman Mao Zedong, our side and the representatives of General Fu held negotiations and signed the "Suiyuan Peace Agreement." During the negotiations, I reported the specific situation directly to Comrade Zhou Enlai, and important issues were decided by Chairman Mao Zedong.

At that time, General Dong Jiyuan was in charge of military and political affairs in Suiyuan, and the situation of the negotiations was continuously reported to him by General Fu Zuoyi. After the agreement was signed, General Dong Jiyuan took many specific measures to implement the agreement and achieve peaceful liberation. In the complex situation at that time, he properly resolved many contradictions and stabilized the situation. Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan strongly obstructed and sabotaged, sending the Chief of the Military Affairs Department, Xu Yongchang, to Suiyuan and Baotou to order the troops to withdraw west, and using methods such as granting ranks and titles to create divisions. General Dong Jiyuan united people from all walks of life and ethnic groups, thwarting the sabotage of Chiang and Yan. At that time, the entire North China region had been liberated, and many spies and bandits had fled to Suiyuan, causing havoc. On July 24, an incident occurred where Wang Shixin, a staff member of the Liaison Office of the North China People's Government in Suiyuan, was killed. General Dong Jiyuan punished the culprits and cracked down on spies and bandits. Later, at the request of Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai, Generals Fu Zuoyi and Deng Baoshan went to Suiyuan to promote the early realization of the uprising. I was responsible for transferring 100,000 yuan of silver from the North China People's Bank to General Fu for the comfort of the soldiers. Through the efforts of all parties, overcoming various difficulties, the "September 19 Uprising" was finally successfully held under the leadership of Generals Dong Jiyuan and Sun Lanfeng.

General Dong Jiyuan sent two telegrams announcing the uprising, one to the Central Committee, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and the other to Commander Nie Rongzhen of the North China Military Region and me. We were very happy upon receiving the telegram and immediately replied to express our congratulations.

After the "September 19 Uprising," Chairman Mao Zedong instructed that Suiyuan would no longer use military control but would establish a Military and Political Committee, with General Fu Zuoyi as the chairman. He also instructed the Suiyuan People's Government and the Suiyuan Military Region to merge and cooperate with General Dong Jiyuan's Suiyuan Government and Security Command. Later, the Central People's Government appointed General Fu Zuoyi as the chairman of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee and the commander of the Suiyuan Military Region; General Dong Jiyuan was appointed as the vice chairman of the Suiyuan Military and Political Committee, the governor of Suiyuan Province, and the deputy commander of the Suiyuan Military Region. I was also appointed as the political commissar of the Suiyuan Military Region.

At the time of General Dong Jiyuan's uprising, it was just before the first session of the Political Consultative Conference was held nationwide. He should have attended the conference, but because he was in charge of the reorganization of the military in Suiyuan and the merger of the local government structure, he could not come to Beijing. In March 1950, he and Comrade Gao Kelin came to Beijing to report to the Central Committee and the State Council. That day, General Fu Zuoyi and the leaders of the North China Military Region welcomed them at the station, and everyone was very pleased to see each other. The North China Military Region also held a banquet to entertain General Dong Jiyuan and his colleagues, and submitted their report to Premier Zhou Enlai for review. Premier Zhou Enlai personally presided over the 28th meeting of the State Council to listen to General Dong Jiyuan's report. Premier Zhou Enlai, holding General Dong's hand, said happily, "This report is very good. The People's Daily should publish it in full." On April 17, the Xinhua News Agency released the report, and the People's Daily and the Suiyuan Daily published it in full on the first page.

On April 8, Chairman Mao Zedong held a banquet at Zhongnanhai to entertain General Dong Jiyuan. Chairman Mao, holding his hand, said, "General Dong, are you well?" On April 27, Chairman Mao had a long conversation with Dong Jiyuan and Gao Kelin. Those present included Premier Zhou Enlai, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, Commander Nie Rongzhen, General Fu Zuoyi, and me. Chairman Mao happily said, "I have read your article, and your work has achieved great results. The uprising is a good thing. The reply telegram was written by me personally. I hope you will unite as one and strive for progress. Chiang used money and ranks to sabotage you, but he did not win the hearts of the people. They finally failed." General Dong Jiyuan always remembered this conversation and often said to others, "This is an important turning point in my thoughts after joining the revolutionary cause."

In September 1950, on the first anniversary of the Suiyuan Uprising, Commander Nie Rongzhen, General Fu Zuoyi, and I sent a telegram to General Dong Jiyuan, saying, "On the occasion of the anniversary of the Suiyuan Uprising, we extend our warm congratulations to all the officers and soldiers of the Suiyuan Uprising. We hope that you will make further efforts to strengthen the construction of the revolutionary army in all aspects, follow the principles of building the army as instructed by Chairman Mao, and continue to strive to build a strong national defense force."

	Merits in the War to Resist America and Aid Korea

Soon after the founding of New China, American imperialism launched the Korean War, occupied our territory of Taiwan with weapons, and brought the war to the banks of the Yalu River, seriously threatening our national security.

The people of the entire country unanimously condemned the crimes of American imperialism and demanded support for the Korean people and participation in the war to resist America and aid Korea. At that time, the Suiyuan Military Region held a model meeting, and 13 war heroes jointly signed a request to go to the front line and fight against the aggressors. On October 25, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army led by Commander Peng Dehuai went to Korea to participate in the war to resist America and aid Korea. At this time, the broad officers and soldiers of the Suiyuan Military Region sent batches of requests to fight against America and aid Korea and to defend the motherland to the military region headquarters. General Dong Jiyuan reported the soldiers' requests to the North China Military Region and the Central Committee on one hand, and specially reported to General Fu Zuoyi on the other. General Fu had previously suggested to Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou that the American invasion of Korea could not be ignored and that active support should be given to Korea. After hearing General Dong Jiyuan's report, he was even more determined to send the uprising troops to participate in the war to resist America and aid Korea. In early November, General Fu suggested to Chairman Mao to transfer the original Suiyuan uprising troops to Korea to fight, so that this force could receive new tempering and new tests, and further realize the transformation into the People's Liberation Army. Chairman Mao approved this suggestion. Premier Zhou, at a meeting of the State Council, announced the formation of the 23rd Army Corps, mainly composed of the original Suiyuan uprising troops, to prepare for the war in Korea.

The Suiyuan Military Region held a meeting of division-level and above cadres to summarize the work of the uprising troops over the past year, and received the order to have General Dong Jiyuan lead the corps, division, and brigade commanders to Beijing to accept new tasks. On November 27, Commander Nie Rongzhen of the North China Military Region, I, and General Fu Zuoyi met with the cadres who came to Beijing. Subsequently, Premier Zhou also met with the comrades of the Suiyuan Military Region and talked with General Dong about the situation of the troops, encouraging them to be brave, face difficulties, prepare to go to Korea to fight, and wait for their news of victory. At the same time, he also cared about General Dong's family, proposing, "After you leave Suiyuan, bring your family to Beijing." General Fu added, "Please rest assured, Premier. I will arrange it for him."

On December 19, General Fu Zuoyi came from Beijing to Suiyuan and officially announced the Central Government's decision to form the 23rd Army Corps, with Dong Jiyuan as the commander and Gao Kelin as the political commissar. Subsequently, the troops were transferred from Suiyuan to Hebei for training and prepared for the war in Korea. The Army Corps reported the situation of the troops' preparations to the Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, after reading it, happily wrote to General Fu, "Brother Yi Sheng: I have read the recent report of the 23rd Army Corps and send it to you for your perusal. Please return it after reading. The 23rd Army Corps has made such great and rapid progress, which is worth celebrating!"

On September 3, 1951, the 23rd Army Corps of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army entered Korea to fight, taking on the tasks of building the Taicheng, Yuanli, and Nanji airfields and rear logistics security. From September 20 to November 4, the officers and soldiers of the 23rd Army Corps, with the support of the Korean people, braved the day and night bombing by enemy planes, overcame various difficulties in transportation and materials, and successfully completed the task of building the airfields. On October 22, the Taicheng and Nanji airfields were bombed by American B-29 heavy bombers, and then batches of planes took turns to bomb the three airfields. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 4,925 bombs and 1,925 timed bombs were dropped. The broad officers and soldiers braved the danger to life, day and night removing timed bombs and repairing the airfields. General Dong Jiyuan personally went to the scene to command, removing timed bombs with the soldiers. The soldiers, for his safety, wanted to pull him to a safe place, saying, "Please rest assured, Commander. We guarantee to complete the mission." General Dong said, "I am responsible if there is a problem." The soldiers said, "You are the commander. We are also responsible for the commander's safety." The soldiers' high sense of friendship and responsibility moved General Dong to tears.

After the 23rd Army Corps completed the task of building the three airfields, they reported to the Volunteer Army Headquarters and the North China Military Region, and forwarded the report to the Korean People's Government. The Central Military Commission sent a congratulatory telegram, and the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea also sent a congratulatory message, saying, "You have established great merits in the struggle to resist America and aid Korea and strike the aggressors. The Korean people will never forget this great merit; all peace-loving people around the world also express their high respect." At the same time, General Dong Jiyuan, Gao Kelin, and four other comrades were each awarded the "Freedom and Independence Second-Class Medal."

During the war to resist America and aid Korea, two uprising troops participated in the Volunteer Army's fighting in Korea. They withstood the test of blood and fire and made outstanding contributions to defending the motherland and world peace. Their merits will forever be remembered by the Chinese and Korean people.

In 1955, the People's Liberation Army implemented the rank system, and General Dong Jiyuan, who was the commander of the 69th Army, was awarded the rank of senior general and the First-Class Liberation Medal. In 1980, with the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission, Comrade Dong Jiyuan became a member of the Communist Party of China. Comrade Dong Jiyuan pursued the ideal of "strengthening the country and the military" in his youth, joined the military to resist Japanese aggression, led his troops to uprising in Suiyuan during the War of Liberation, and made outstanding contributions to defending the motherland and world peace during the war to resist America and aid Korea. In the period of socialist construction, he made contributions to the prosperity and unity of the motherland. His passing is a great loss to our party and our army. His historical merits will be forever remembered by the people.

　　悼念董其武将军
    薄一波
    董其武同志与世长辞了！噩耗传来，不胜痛悼。他为了祖国的富强，毕生奋斗，功不可没。生为民族精英，死而风范长存。
    为怀念董其武同志，谨撰此文，以寄哀思。
    　　　　抗日爱国将领
    董其武同志，１８９９年生于山西河津县一个贫农家庭。当时正值清朝末年，官府腐败，民不聊生。他的外祖父因发动当地义和团起义，烧教堂，杀鬼子，惨遭杀害。他自幼由外祖母抚养，长而好学，攻读经史。后怀着“富国强兵”之志，毅然投笔从戎，决心当一名爱国军人。
    他从１９２４年开始军旅生活，连年作战，几易部队。北伐开始后，他参加了国民革命军第四军先遣纵队，任支队长，转战豫皖各地，屡立战功，后升任中校副团长。但因不是蒋介石嫡系部队，竟遭编遣，使其富国强兵的心愿成为泡影。他本想到上海另谋出路，结果生活陷入绝境。当时，任天津特别市警备司令的傅作义将军，正在扩编军队。他一向景仰傅将军，遂变卖衣物作路费，千里迢迢奔赴天津。经傅将军的考察，委任董为额外上尉参谋。他不嫌官职小，军衔低，工作尽职尽责，得到傅将军的赞赏，不久升为少校参谋。
    在傅作义将军的统率下，他带兵有方，后担任了中校副团长、团长等职。接着，他随傅将军返回绥远，当时土匪猖獗，危害民众，因此回到绥远的第一件大事就是清乡剿匪。他在肃清匪患中，不为赃官巨款贿赂而徇情枉法，不为坏人施的美人计所腐蚀，坚决严惩匪首，秉公执法，为民除害，使绥东五县的社会治安大为好转。
    “九一八”事变后，他看到东北三省大片国土沦陷，千千万万同胞惨遭日军蹂躏，深感“国家兴亡，匹夫有责”，作为一个中国军人，守土卫国是自己的天职。于是，他向傅作义将军呈上了抗日请战书。１９３３年初，傅将军率部第５９军，由绥远出师东进抗日。董其武所在的第２１８旅担任先头部队。当时日军攻陷了古北口，北平告急。傅将军奉命率部奔赴昌平，在怀柔一带进行狙击。董其武团在作战中英勇杀敌，曾一天连续七次粉碎日军的进攻。全军将士把傅将军提出的“宁作战死鬼，不做亡国奴”的口号当作抗日信条，誓死保卫国土，赢得首战胜利，受到全国各报的热情赞扬，被称为“长城抗战”。
    长城抗战之后，董其武升任第２１８旅少将旅长。随后，他率部参加了震动中外的“绥远抗战”。这是傅将军在中国共产党抗日救国号召和全国抗日怒潮激励下，发动的一次大败日伪军、收复失地的著名战役。这次战役分两个阶段，在傅作义将军精心部署下，首先是董其武旅长和彭毓斌师长组织指挥的红格尔图战役。红格尔图，当时属绥远陶林县（现属内蒙古右后旗），是日伪进犯必争的咽喉要地，也是抗日军民必守的战略要点。在当地蒙族军民的配合与协助下，先后激战七昼夜，捣毁了日军田中隆吉和伪军头目王英的指挥部，共毙伤敌伪军１７００余人，俘虏伪军３００余名，生俘日军电台台长八牟礼吉等人，击落敌机１架，缴获无线电台１部、汽车数辆、军马百余匹，还缴获了日本关东军发给王英的各地日伪电台联络表和密码本。红格尔图之战，为夺取百灵庙扫清了障碍，铺平了道路。接着，是由孙长胜、孙兰峰旅长指挥的百灵庙战役。他们向日伪军盘据的百灵庙发动了猛烈进攻，击毙日伪军近千人，俘敌４００余人，缴获步兵炮３门、迫击炮６门、马步枪８００余支、电台３部、汽车５辆、战马２００余匹等。绥远抗战大捷，全国欢欣鼓舞，振奋了全民抗战的热情。毛泽东同志曾派南汉宸同志携带他的亲笔贺信及绣有“为国御侮”四字的锦旗，赴绥远表示亲切慰问。毛泽东同志对“绥远抗战”给予高度评价，称为“全国抗战之先声”。
    “七七”事变爆发后，侵华日军大举进攻，全国奋起抗战，八路军由陕北开赴华北前线。在举世闻名的平型关大战中，董其武将军率第２１８旅奉傅作义将军命令，自阳坊口驰援平型关。他们冒着滂沱大雨，在山路上穿行急进，出色地完成了战斗任务。傅作义部的出击，对平型关大捷起了配合作用。
    这里着重讲讲董其武将军在忻口会战中指挥部队英勇作战的事迹。这是抗战初期华北方面举行的规模较大、时间较长的一次著名战役。日伪军投入兵力六七万人，国民党军投入１０万余人，战役历时２３天，双方死伤数万人。在忻口会战中，董其武旅奉命担任袭击日军板垣前线指挥所和摧毁敌炮兵阵地的艰巨任务。他精心部署，亲自到前沿阵地指挥，战斗中不幸左臂负伤，血流不止，但仍坚持指挥战斗。后因弹片未取出而感染，臂部红肿，仍然不让向总部报告，始终战斗在第一线。傅作义将军得知他负伤的消息，遂令第２１１旅旅长孙兰峰急速前去接替他指挥。他说：“在这种紧要关头，我哪能因一点轻伤就退下去呢！”于是又同孙旅长一起指挥战斗，直到胜利地完成任务，缴获了板垣第５师团、东条英机蒙疆兵团３２旅团和第１２留守师团铃木旅团等部许多战利品，受到总部的奖赏。忻口会战结束后，傅作义将军要他马上到太原医治臂伤，他到医院取出弹片的第二天，又让医官带上药一起赶回了忻口。由于他出色地完成了战斗任务，被提升为１０１师中将师长。
    他在担任师长期间，先后率部参加了包头战役、绥远战役和五原战役，重创日军，屡建功勋，因此又被升任暂编第４军军长，后调任第３５军军长。日本投降前夕，他任第１２战区政治部主任兼晋陕绥边区副总司令。
    从长城抗战到日本投降的１２年间，董其武将军率部坚决抗战，保卫国土，功勋卓著，为国人所敬仰，不愧是一位抗日救国的著名爱国将领。
    　　　　绥远率部起义
    １９４９年９月１９日，全国大陆解放前夕，董其武将军在绥远率部起义，胜利实现了毛泽东同志提出的“绥远方式”。这是他对我国解放事业作出的一大贡献。
    绥远和平解放谈判，是毛泽东、周恩来同志亲自领导的。开始由贺龙同志主持，后来绥远划归华北区，便由聂荣臻同志和我主持。我当时是华北局第一书记、华北军区政治委员。因此，我参加了谈判、起义、改编的全部过程。
    绥远国民党军是华北“剿总”管辖的部队，有一个军部、８个师、８个旅，董其武为华北“剿总”驻归绥指挥所主任，也是绥远省主席、绥远省保安司令。１月２１日，傅作义将军宣布北平国民党军接受改编，北平实现和平解放。董其武将军得知这一消息，于第二天即飞抵北平，谒见傅将军，明确表示要追随傅先生走和平道路。傅将军告诉他：“绥远问题等我见到毛泽东之后再定。”
    ２月２３日，毛泽东同志在西柏坡接见傅作义、邓宝珊两将军时，提出了“绥远方式”，即两军划一分界线，维持现状，让董其武将军做好内部工作，待条件成熟时起义。３月２３日，毛泽东同志在中国共产党七届二中全会报告中，进一步阐述了“绥远方式”，就是有意保留一部分国民党军队，作暂时的让步，在相当长的一段时间以后，再去按照人民解放军的制度，将这部分军队改编为人民解放军。
    遵照毛泽东同志提出的方针原则，我方与傅方代表举行了谈判，签订了《绥远和平协议》。在谈判期间，都是由我将具体情况直接向周恩来同志报告，重要的问题请毛泽东同志作决断。
    董其武将军当时在归绥主持军政工作，谈判的情况不断由傅作义将军派人与他通报。协议签订后，董其武将军为贯彻协议，实现和平解放，采取了许多具体措施。在当时复杂的情况下，他妥善解决许多矛盾，稳住了局势。蒋介石、阎锡山极力阻挠破坏，派军令部长徐永昌等，到归绥、包头强令部队西撤，还用封官许愿等办法，制造分裂。董其武将军团结各界、各族知名人士，粉碎了蒋、阎的破坏。当时华北全境已解放，许多特务、土匪分子，窜到绥远来，活动十分猖獗。７月２４日，发生了杀害华北人民政府派驻归绥联络处工作人员王世鑫事件，董其武将军惩办了凶手，对特务、土匪进行了打击。后来，受毛泽东、周恩来同志委托，傅作义、邓宝珊将军赴绥远促成起义早日实现。我负责从华北人民银行拨款１０万银元，供傅将军慰劳将士之用。经过多方努力，排除种种困难，终于在董其武、孙兰峰将军的率领下，胜利举行了“九·一九”起义。
    董其武将军发出的起义通电，一份给党中央毛泽东主席、朱德总司令，一份给华北军区聂荣臻司令员和我。我们收电后十分高兴，当即复电表示祝贺。
    “九·一九”起义后，毛泽东同志指示，绥远不再用军管形式，要成立军政委员会，由傅作义将军任主席，并指示绥远人民政府和绥远军区，与董其武将军的绥远政府和保安司令部，实行合并、合作。后来，中央人民政府任命傅作义将军为绥远省军政委员会主席、绥远省军区司令员；任命董其武将军为绥远省军政委员会副主席、绥远省主席、绥远省军区副司令员。任命我兼绥远省军区政治委员。
    董其武将军起义时，正是全国第一届政治协商会议召开前夕，他本应参加会议，但因主持绥远的军队改编和地方政府机构合并组建工作未能来京。１９５０年３月，他和高克林同志到北京，向党中央、政务院汇报工作。这天，傅作义先生和华北军区领导同志，一起到车站迎接，大家见面甚为欣慰。华北军区还设宴招待董其武将军等，并将他们的一份汇报材料，呈送给周恩来总理审阅。周总理亲自主持召开政务院第２８次会议，听取董其武将军的汇报。周总理高兴地握着董将军的手说：“这个报告很好，《人民日报》要全文发表。”４月１７日，由新华社发了通稿，《人民日报》、《绥远日报》都在第一版上全文刊登。
    毛泽东主席于４月８日，在中南海设宴招待董其武将军。毛主席握着他的手说：“董将军好吗？”２７日，毛主席又和董其武、高克林作了长时间谈话。在场的有周恩来总理、朱德总司令、聂荣臻司令员、傅作义将军和我。毛主席高兴地说：“你的文章我看到了，工作很有成绩嘛。起义是一件好事，给你的复电是我亲笔写的，希望你们团结一致，力求进步。蒋以钱以官来破坏你们，不得人心嘛，他们终于失败了。”董其武将军一直牢记这次谈话，常常对人说：“这是我走上革命道路后的一个重要的思想转变。”
    １９５０年９月，在绥远起义一周年之际，聂荣臻司令员、傅作义将军和我致电董其武将军，贺电说：“值此绥远起义周年，特向绥远起义官兵全体同志们致以热烈的庆贺：希望进一步努力，更好地加强革命部队的一切建设工作，依据毛主席指示的建军原则，为建成一支坚强的国防军而继续奋斗。”
    　　　　抗美援朝立功勋
    新中国成立不久，美帝国主义发动了侵朝战争，并武装占领我国领土台湾，把战火烧到了鸭绿江边，严重威胁我国安全。
    全国人民一致愤怒声讨美帝罪行，要求支援朝鲜人民，参加抗美援朝。当时，绥远省军区召开英模会议，有１３名战斗英雄联合签名，表示要求上前线，打击侵略者。１０月２５日，彭德怀司令员率领的中国人民志愿军，赴朝参加抗美援朝战争。这时，绥远军区部队广大指战员要求抗美援朝、保家卫国的决心书、请战书，一批批送到军区机关。董其武将军将官兵们的要求，一方面向华北军区和党中央反映，一方面特意向傅作义将军作了汇报。傅将军一开始就曾向毛主席、周总理作过建议，对美帝侵朝，不能置之不理，要积极对朝鲜进行支援。这时听了董其武将军的汇报，更坚定了要求派起义部队参加抗美援朝的决心。１１月上旬，傅将军向毛主席建议，调原绥远起义部队赴朝参战，使这支部队受到新的锻炼、新的考验，进一步实现解放军化。毛主席批准了这一建议。周总理在政务院约见傅将军，宣布以原绥远起义部队为主，成立第２３兵团，准备入朝作战。
    绥远军区在召开旅以上干部会议，总结起义部队一年来工作时，接到了要董其武将军带领军、师、旅长来京接受新任务的命令。１１月２７日，华北军区聂荣臻司令员、我和傅作义将军，会见了来京干部。随后，周总理又会见了绥远军区的同志，并和董将军交谈了部队的情况，要他们鼓起勇气，正视困难，准备赴朝参战，等待他们的胜利消息。同时，还关心董将军的家庭，提出：“你离开绥远后，把家眷接出来，住在北京。”傅将军接着说：“请总理放心，我替他安排。”
    １２月１９日，傅作义将军从北京来绥远，正式宣布中央决定，成立第２３兵团，董其武为司令员、高克林为政治委员。接着，部队从绥远转移到河北整训，作好入朝作战准备。兵团将部队准备工作的情况，向党中央、毛主席写了总结报告。毛主席看后高兴地批给傅将军，“宜生兄：２３兵团最近情况报告一份，送上请阅。阅后请予掷还。２３兵团进步如此之大且快，可为庆贺！”
    １９５１年９月３日，中国人民志愿军第２３兵团入朝作战，担任了修建泰川、院里、南市三个机场及后勤警戒任务。从９月２０日至１１月４日，第２３兵团干部战士在朝鲜人民的支援下，冒着敌机日夜轰炸，克服运输、器材等种种困难，胜利完成了修建机场任务。１０月２２日，泰川、南市机场遭到美Ｂ—２９重型轰炸机的轰炸，后又有成批飞机轮番向三个机场轰炸。据不完全统计，共投下炸弹４９２５枚，定时炸弹１９２５枚。广大干部战士冒着生命危险，日夜不停地排除定时炸弹，抢修筑机场。董其武将军亲自到现场指挥，与战士们一起排除定时炸弹。战士们为了他的安全，要把他拉到远处去，说：“请首长放心，我们保证完成任务。”董将军说：“出了问题我有责任。”战士们又说：“你是首长，保证首长安全，我们也有责任。”战士们高度的友爱与责任感，使董将军感动得流下了眼泪。
    第２３兵团完成修筑三个机场任务后，向志愿军司令部、华北军区写了一份报告，并转报给朝鲜人民政府。中央军委发来贺电，朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员长也发来贺信，说：“你们在抗美援朝打击侵略者的斗争中，建立了伟大的功勋。这一功勋，朝鲜人民永志不忘；全世界爱好和平的人民，也莫不表示崇高的敬意。”同时，授予董其武、高克林等六同志各一枚“自由独立二级勋章”。
    在抗美援朝期间，有两支起义部队参加志愿军入朝作战，他们经受住了血与火的考验，为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平作出了卓越贡献。他们的功绩将永远记在中朝人民心中。
    １９５５年，人民解放军实行军衔制，任第６９军军长的董其武，被授予上将军衔，并授予一级解放勋章。１９８０年，经中共中央、中央军委批准，董其武同志成为中国共产党党员。董其武同志少年时期追求“富国强兵”理想，投笔从戎；日本帝国主义侵华战争时期，是抗日爱国将领；解放战争时期，在绥远率部光荣起义；抗美援朝时期，为保卫祖国、保卫和平立下功勋；在社会主义建设时期，为祖国繁荣和统一作出了贡献。他的逝世，是我党、我军一大损失，他所建树的历史功绩，将为人民所永远铭记。
