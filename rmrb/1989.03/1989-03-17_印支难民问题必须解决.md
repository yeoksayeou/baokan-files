Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 16th.

China has consistently supported the efforts of ASEAN countries to seek a resolution to the Indochina refugee problem and respects the measures taken by ASEAN countries for this purpose.

Li Zhaoxing, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press conference this afternoon in response to a reporter's question: "Only by eliminating the root causes of the Indochina refugee problem can the problem be fundamentally resolved. Therefore, the countries directly responsible for the Indochina refugee problem should fulfill their obligations to the international community and their own people, and stop implementing policies that lead to large-scale refugee outflows."

Li Zhaoxing also said, "The British government has a responsibility to take effective measures to resolve the issue of Vietnamese refugees stranded in Hong Kong before 1997. If this issue is not promptly and properly resolved, it will affect the smooth transition in 1997 and will impose an unnecessary burden on the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government."

　　印支难民问题必须解决
    新华社北京３月１６日电  外交部发言人李肇星今天在此间表示，中国一贯支持东盟国家为谋求解决印支难民问题所做出的努力，尊重东盟国家为此而采取的措施。
    李肇星在今天下午的新闻发布会上回答记者提问时说：“只有消除了产生印支难民问题的根源，才能从根本上解决印支难民问题。因此，对造成印支难民问题负有直接责任的国家，应切实履行对国际社会和本国人民的义务，停止推行导致大批难民外流的政策。”
    李肇星还说，“英国政府有责任采取有效措施在１９９７年前解决滞留在香港的越南难民问题；如果这一问题不能及时得到合理解决，势将影响到１９９７年度的顺利过渡，并会给未来的香港特别行政区政府带来不应有的负担。”
