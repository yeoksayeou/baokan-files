    To Find a Good Job, One Must Spend Money
    College Students Giving Gifts for Job Hunting Becomes a Trend
    Givers Have Their Reasons, but Receivers Should Feel Guilty

    According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, reporter Jiang Qianfeng recently visited dozens of graduating college students, many of whom admitted to giving gifts while seeking job placements. A person involved in college student job placements said that this year's job placement for college students has seen an alarming increase in the "standard" and scope of gift-giving. Why have college students, who were once considered high-minded and righteous, now joined the ranks of gift-givers?

    First, the unhealthy social atmosphere forces them to follow the trend. After the reform of the college student job placement system, many students have taken the path of finding jobs on their own. However, some students reflect that in today's society, not giving gifts and not pulling strings makes it very difficult to get things done. Gift-giving has become a heavy psychological burden for job-seeking students.

    Second, the job placement process lacks a fair competition mechanism. Many students believe that while we welcome the supply-demand matching and dual-choice placement method, currently many employers lack strict recruitment and evaluation systems, and there is a lot of arbitrariness, which provides an opportunity for unhealthy practices. Some students angrily say: "What about ability and specialty? It's all about money and connections!"

    Third, there is a lack of transparency and a strong supervisory mechanism. Some students reflect that in the dual-choice process, due to various factors limiting both supply and demand sides, many students are making blind choices. They hope to adopt methods such as public recruitment by employers and public disclosure of employer information by schools to increase the transparency of graduate job placements. At the same time, they appeal to relevant national departments to establish a strong supervisory mechanism to eliminate various abnormal phenomena in college student job hunting.

　　为找好工作　不得不破费
    大学生求职送礼成风
    送者自有苦衷　收者岂不亏心
    据新华社北京３月１４日电  新华社记者江钱峰近日走访了数十名应届大学毕业生，其中不少人承认在联系工作单位时送了礼。据一位从事大学生分配工作的同志讲，今年大学生分配中出现的送礼“规格”之高、涉及面之大令人担忧。为什么过去常被人视为清高、嫉恶如仇的大学生，现在也加入了送礼的行列呢？　　一、社会风气不正迫使他们在求职时不得不随波逐流。大学生分配制度改革后，不少大学生走上自谋职业的道路。但有的大学生反映，现在社会上不送礼，不拉关系就很难办事。送礼，给求职的大学生造成了沉重的心理负担。
    二、求职分配过程中还缺乏公平的竞争机制。许多大学生认为，实行供需见面、双向选择的分配办法我们欢迎，但是目前许多用人单位没有严格的录用考核制度，随意性很大，这给了不正之风可乘之机。有的大学生气愤地说：“什么能力、专业，还是钱和关系管用！”
    三、缺乏透明度，缺乏强有力的监督机制。一些大学生反映，在双向选择中，供需双方因为诸多因素限制，使不少学生处于盲目选择中。他们希望采取用人单位公开招聘、学校公开用人单位信息等办法增加毕业生分配的透明度，同时呼吁国家有关部门建立强有力的监督机制，杜绝大学生求职中的种种不正常现象。
