Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 28th. (Trainee Reporter Xu Wei) According to materials provided by the State Price Bureau, a total of 68,000 cases of illegal price increases in industrial and agricultural production materials were investigated nationwide last year, with illegal earnings amounting to 786 million yuan.

Among these cases, illegal price increases in agricultural production materials were particularly severe. From March to May last year, inspections of over 56,000 units revealed more than 16,000 cases of price violations, with a total value of over 130 million yuan.

Investigations showed that last year, some monopolistic industries arbitrarily converted planned production materials into higher-priced non-planned sales or added extra charges. Some companies, blurring the lines between official and commercial activities, exploited the "dual-track" pricing system, reselling materials with layer upon layer of added prices. This has become the main form of illegal price increases in production materials. According to the State Price Bureau, the Chemical Department of the Chemical Light Industry Company under the Weifang City Materials Bureau in Shandong Province purchased 50 tons of low-pressure polyethylene at 4,050 yuan per ton from their own company's operating department. Before the goods left the warehouse, they were resold eight times on the spot, with the price soaring to 8,000 yuan per ton.

The State Price Bureau requires that local price inspection agencies strictly investigate and handle cases of illegal price increases in industrial and agricultural production materials. Those that should be confiscated will be confiscated, and those that should be prosecuted will be prosecuted.

　　生产资料违法涨价严重        
    查出非法收入逾七亿元
    据新华社北京３月２８日电  （实习生徐伟）据国家物价局提供的材料，去年全国共查处工农业生产资料价格违法案件６．８万多起，查出非法所得达７．８６亿元。
    在这些案件中，农业生产资料价格违法情况尤其严重。仅去年３至５月对５．６万多个单位检查，就查出１．６万多起价格违法案件，违价金额达１．３亿多元。
    据调查，去年一些垄断性行业的公司擅自将计划内生产资料转为计划外高价销售或搞价外加价；一些官商不分的公司钻价格“双轨制”的空子，层层转手加价倒卖。这已成为生产资料乱涨价的主要形式。据国家物价局介绍，山东省潍坊市物资局化轻公司化工科，从本公司经营处以每吨４０５０元的价格购进低压聚乙烯５０吨，货未出库，就地８次转手，价格竟抬高到每吨８０００元。
    国家物价局要求各地物价检查机构对工农业生产资料价格违法案件要严肃查处，该没收的没收，该法办的法办。
