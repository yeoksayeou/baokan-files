　　西藏区党委分析拉萨局势
    胡锦涛提醒严防新的分裂活动
    本报拉萨３月１５日电  记者卢小飞报道：今天下午，西藏自治区党委书记胡锦涛在区党委召开的厅、局级以上党员干部会上指出：国务院发布戒严令后，拉萨局势趋于稳定，但少数分裂主义分子不会善罢甘休，他们可能变换手法，采用新形式对抗，对此要有高度的警惕。
    区党委副书记丹增在通报情况时说，今年３月５日至７日的拉萨骚乱，是自１９８７年９月２７日发生骚乱以来，几次骚乱中最严重的一次。骚乱分子打击的主要目标是党和政府的基层机关、公安部门和新闻宣传单位。骚乱中，有２４个国家机关单位、９９个个体工商户，以及２０多辆汽车、几十辆自行车和三轮车遭到破坏。
    他说，公安部门在武警部队配合下，收缴了一些武器和一些鼓吹“独立”的宣传品。他透露，参加骚乱的人中，有个别职工和学生。
    区党委副书记、人民政府主席多吉才让指出，应当把国务院发布戒严令当作一个转机，认真整顿机关作风，提高工作效率。
