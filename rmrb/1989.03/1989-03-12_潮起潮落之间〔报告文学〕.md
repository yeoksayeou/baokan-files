Between the Tides

Han Lei

I

In December 1986, Zhang Zongxun took over as the director of the Guizhou Television Factory. On his first day, he walked with a frown, red-faced, and staggering, like a god of wine from the banks of the Zhejiang River.

The factory was already in deep debt, with 18,000 black-and-white TVs piled up and color TVs incurring a loss of 4,249,000 yuan.

The tides rise and fall, and the river flows. What was the market situation for TVs at that time? Black-and-white TVs were unwanted; if efforts were made to sell them, some profit could still be made. Color TVs were in high demand, with supply not meeting demand, but no one dared to sell them because selling one meant losing one. Today, as the director, facing the rising cost of raw materials, he had no authority to decide on price increases and could not order a halt to production. What to do? Profitable products were piling up, and losing products were in demand. Pair them up! Urban commercial departments sold one color TV with ten black-and-white TVs, and this potential had already been fully exploited. The pairing ratio in rural areas was even higher. Who dared to buy in large quantities for fear of piling up?

The factory director responsibility system at this time seemed to be just a blank check because, facing the market situation at that time, the director actually could not take responsibility and dared not take responsibility. This was not entirely a problem of the enterprise's decision-makers' poor management but more a problem of systemic flaws bringing trouble to the enterprise.

China is indeed a mysterious country: ten years ago, several hundred million people still believed that although the world is colorful, only black and white can pass through; yet in just a few years, this country leaped to become one of the most important color TV producers in the world today. Its color TV assembly production capacity ranks first in the world, and in one wave, 113 color TV production lines surged in.

The rising tide foreshadows the falling tide, and what will be stranded when the tide falls?

We need not hide the fact that when color TVs were rushed into production, the country lost control at the macro level, busy only with introducing color TV assembly production lines, while neglecting the most important link in color TV production—the introduction of color picture tube factories. The 113 color TV production lines were matched with only one color picture tube factory with low production. Many monks and little porridge, waiting for rice to cook. When the decision was finally made to spend foreign exchange to import color picture tubes, it was found that others had already set a high price, clearly falling into someone else's trap. Thus, the tide suddenly fell, the price of raw materials soared, the cost of color TVs became higher and higher, but the price of color TVs was controlled by the state. The test came to those TV factories with insufficient funds.

"This ship is going to capsize," Zhang Zongxun muttered to himself. Without color TVs, people wanted color TVs, and once they had color TVs, they were stuck on them. What to do?

Export? There was no problem with quality. Toshiba Company recognized that the "Huari" brand color TV had reached and partially exceeded its own product standards. After inspection, Americans also believed that this Chinese color TV was indeed top-notch. But to get American wholesalers to help "Huari" break into the U.S. market, the price of a single color TV had to be controlled at around $110. For Zhang Zongxun, every imported color picture tube, after turning over, cost $80-90. This export deal was also not profitable.

So, just wait to die? In the tide of commodity economy, "soul returns to the sky of sorrow"? Zhang Zongxun smiled. He thought, since 1978, our factory has always been placed in a desperate situation and then survived?

In 1978, the Guizhou Television Factory paid taxes to the state for the first time in its ten years of operation—25,000 yuan, but the entire enterprise made no profit. A TV factory with no profit for ten years, is this not a living corpse?

But at that time, there was no tide, only a stagnant pool, so we were still alive... Moreover, at that time, people had just experienced the decade of turmoil, they were kind-hearted and optimistic, and were they afraid of death?

Recalling the Cultural Revolution, a line from a model opera suddenly came to mind, "You want to kill me, blind your eyes... I won't die, I want to live..."

Zhang Zongxun thought and thought, and sighed.

II

To reverse the factory's severe loss situation, it was necessary to spare no effort to push a large number of accumulated black-and-white TVs out of the market, using the profits from black-and-white TVs to make up for the losses from color TVs. Although this was a very abnormal phenomenon, if one wanted to get through the crisis of 1987, there was no other choice.

Since the "Huari" brand color TV was put into production, the work of pushing black-and-white TVs in the factory was neglected, and the original sales channels were blocked by shortsighted decisions, while new sales channels were not opened in time. The enthusiasm of the relevant departments in the factory responsible for sales was dampened, and the relevant reward system was not perfect.

Sales are an art. Zhang Zongxun made up his mind that the first thing to do after taking office was to ignite a blazing fire in the factory's sales department. At the factory management meeting, he spoke passionately: "Sales work is the key to whether our factory can survive in the competition. We should immediately establish the strategic policy of 'focusing on the province, developing the southwest, holding on to the northeast, and facing the nation,' change the previous weak sales situation, take national second and third-level supply and procurement stations as the backbone, and other channels as auxiliary, give full play to our advantages of hard work and perseverance, strengthen sales, and open up the market with quality and service..." He immediately decided to invite experienced retired old comrades to come back and urge them to take on the mission of saving the factory in times of crisis. At the same time, he selected capable personnel from various departments of the factory to strengthen the sales department.

At this time, it was just before the Lunar New Year, and firecrackers were exploding everywhere. Many enterprises that made a profit in a year were celebrating the New Year with joy, putting up spring couplets, and buying New Year's goods. As the person in charge of a severely loss-making enterprise, Zhang Zongxun must have felt very embarrassed to see this! But in his embarrassment, he also saw an opportunity and decided to fight to the death, ordering all sales personnel to immediately set out in all directions, south to Shenzhen, north to Dandong, taking advantage of the weakness in sales by other factories before the New Year, quickly unblock various past sales channels, and through emotional connections, establish new sales outlets.

Thus, in the vast snowy land, in the vast desert, sales teams appeared... At the same time, three after-sales service teams with sales tasks were quickly formed, taking the remote mountainous areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan as the main targets, wading through water and mountains, and far-reaching in the Great Wall and the southwest mountains. Among them were factory leaders, white-haired old comrades, and young, capable people. Old and young worked together, sharing the same boat and overcoming difficulties. Finally, after more than a month, good news came from all over the country: 31,035 black-and-white TVs were sold in 40 days.

The willows turned green, and the factory had a turning point. Zhang Zongxun encouraged everyone to seize the opportunity and continue to strengthen sales. Half a year passed, and the sales department sold 134,000 black-and-white TVs with astonishing efficiency, almost the total annual production plan of the entire factory, and the loss finally turned into profit. A storm that almost led to bankruptcy began to subside.

III

Zhang Zongxun's self-awareness was clear. He knew: whether it was turbulent waves or calm waters, as the director, I must first make it clear: I am in the water. Understanding this means understanding everything, understanding the merciless surge of the commodity economy tide. Smart people should seize the opportunity, go surfing, go with the tide, at least be a "light boat" and not a "sinking boat." In 1987, heaven had eyes and let me have a "victorious escape." What next?

What does the next five years mean for the TV factory? In another five years, the domestic color TV market in China will tend to be saturated. A new competitive crisis, a new test of life and death, will once again descend on the "Huari" factory. In times of peace, think of danger. At that time, will the competition really only stay on the basis of mutual benefit and coexistence? Is there really no loser in the competition? Compared with domestic peers, "Huari" is a small factory. It started late and had low production, so it was weak in every way; but it also had a high starting point and advanced technology, and most domestic color TVs did not have the advanced technology of "international two integrated circuit boards" that it introduced later. In this situation of both advantages and disadvantages, how will the "Huari" factory continue to survive and develop in the future?

Perhaps, in five years, Zhang Zongxun will no longer be the director. If he has already taken a higher position or resigned and changed jobs, the place will be empty, and the tea will be cold. Is it worth worrying and taking risks for the next person? Less idle worry, more bonuses, can't we just pass the days in peace and win praise?

Still, we have to go for it! For Zhang Zongxun, a man should be born with a sword, and the years flow like a tide, but the desire to struggle and seek has never changed, and the will to reform and strengthen and strive for progress has never wavered. Zhang Zongxun revealed his heart to his colleagues: we are Communist Party members and cannot be satisfied with the status quo and not strive for progress, but should have the broad-mindedness of "planting trees for future generations to enjoy the shade." The new decision was finally made by the collective:

--- Prepare to establish the Huari Electrical Appliance Group Company. With the "Huari" series of products as the leader, cooperate with specialized factories in Guizhou and even the southwest, making the enterprise's production mode transition from a small and closed type to a multi-cooperation open type, and through close cooperation, form a reliable support for the enterprise to expand its scale economy;

--- Through the paid acquisition of external factories, quickly renovate an annual production line of 500,000 color TVs and black-and-white TVs, making the enterprise strengthen its own production capacity while increasing the competitiveness of its products in the domestic and international markets. At the same time, do everything possible to promote new product development and technological progress to achieve benefits;

--- Occupy the window of Hainan, buy a small factory that once assembled TVs, and use the preferential policies of the state for Hainan Province to combine industry and commerce, thus accumulating funds and technology like a snowball, and strive to participate in international technological exchanges and market division of labor.

These three decisions have begun to take shape with unremitting efforts. The preparatory work for the Huari Electrical Appliance Group Company has been completed; the paid acquisition of the Guiyang South Ming Refractory Materials Factory has been completed; the Hainan Huari Electrical Appliance Company started making a profit as soon as it opened. When the bell of the New Year's Eve of 1988 rang, Zhang Zongxun was sitting on a train returning from a business trip. He ate boxed meals while thinking, this year's game is probably a win.

IV

A song "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night" colors the tide and the moon so beautifully! The "tide" in Zhang Ruoxu's pen is beautiful. The "tide" in Li Bai's pen is also beautiful. In 1988, the tide of commodity production surging in the Guizhou Television Factory, if described with a sentence from "Dream of the Red Chamber," can also be said to be "though not of perfect beauty, it is also not ordinary." This year, the Guizhou Television Factory completed a total industrial output value of 200 million yuan, of which the "Huari" brand color TV created foreign exchange earnings of $13 million for the whole year. At the same time, the "Huari" brand color TV was on the honor roll, winning the first prize in the second national color TV quality competition for the first time, and smoothly passing the "department-level excellent" test. It was only because the production scale was too small and the output was too low that it could not reach the "national-level excellent" standard.

So, what about this year? This year, 1989, the Guizhou Television Factory will write an extraordinary page in the history of China's electronics industry, and the "Huari" brand color TV will export 100,000 units to European countries for the first time, a record unmatched in the country.

In 1989, the Guizhou Television Factory will be the first to launch a 21-inch straight-angle remote control color TV.

In 1989, the Guizhou Television Factory will begin producing and launching the "Huari" brand VCR.

The reform tide in China has surged for 10 years. In 10 years, the TVs produced by the Guizhou Television Factory have had the "Haiyan" brand, the "Haiying" brand, and the "Huari" brand. To be honest, whether it was "Haiyan" or "Haiying," they had never actually flown over the sea, but only expressed the kind and beautiful wishes of the people of Yelang. Only the "Huari," which was introduced and produced, after many hardships, between the tides, finally successfully broke out of the Yelang Kingdom and went to the world.

After the excitement, people always wanted to say something.

Say what?

History is a comedy.

　　潮起潮落之间〔报告文学〕
    韩磊
    一
    １９８６年１２月，张宗舜出任贵州电视机厂厂长。上任那天，皱着眉，红着脸，步履蹒跚，活像一个赤水河边的酒神。
    厂里已经是债台高筑，黑白机积压１８０００台，彩电亏损４２４９０００元。
    潮起潮落，江流波涌。当时国内电视机市场是一种什么样的行情？黑白机没人要，倘能下大力气推销，还能赚点钱；彩电是紧俏商品，市场上供不应求，然而谁也不敢卖，因为卖１台就赔１台。今天他当了厂长，面对原材料成本日益高涨的大潮，既无权决定提价，更不能下令停产，怎么办？赚钱的产品积压，赔钱的东西抢手，搭配吧！城里商业部门卖１台彩电要搭配１０台黑白机，这挖潜已经是到头了。农村的搭配比例更大，谁敢不怕积压而大量进货呢？
    厂长负责制在此时仿佛只是一张空头支票，因为面对当时那种市场状况，厂长实际上无法负责，也不敢负责。这不完全是企业决策人经营不善的问题，而更多的是体制上的弊端给企业带来的困扰。
    中国，真是一个神奇的国家：十年前好几亿国民都还认定，大千世界虽然色彩斑斓，但能通行无阻的却只有黑白两道；可是短短几年之内，这个国家一跃成为当今世界最重要的彩电生产国之一，它的彩电整机生产能力傲居全球首位，一个热潮中竟涌进了１１３条彩电生产线。
    潮起预示着潮要落，落潮时搁浅的会是什么呢？
    我们不必讳言，在彩电一窝蜂上马的时候，国家在宏观上失控，只顾忙于引进生产整机的彩电生产线，而偏偏忽视了彩电生产中最重要的一环——彩色显像管厂的引进。１１３条彩电生产线与之配套的却只有一家产量很低的彩色显像管厂。僧多粥少，等米下锅。待到痛下决心拿出外汇去进口彩色显像管时，才发觉人家早已待价而沽，漫天要价了，分明又落入他人圈套。于是大潮骤落，原材料价格扶摇直上，彩电成本越来越高，彩电价格却由国家控制。考验降临在那些资金不足的电视机厂头上。
    “这条船要翻，”张宗舜自言自语道。没彩电时想彩电，上了彩电反而要困死在彩电上面，这如何是好？
    出口？质量上没问题。东芝公司认可“华日”牌彩电已经达到和局部超过其自身产品标准。美国人经过考察也认为这种中国彩电质量确属一流。但要美国批发商同意帮助“华日”打进美国市场，彩电单机价格必须控制在１１０美元左右。对张宗舜来说每只进口彩色显像管经过周转拿到手就需要八九十个美元。这笔出口买卖同样是不合算的。
    那么就等死？在商品经济大潮中“魂归离恨天”？张宗舜笑了。他想，自１９７８年以来，我们厂哪一次不是置于死地而后生？
    １９７８年，贵州电视机厂建厂十年来第一次向国家交了税——２５０００元，但整个企业在利润上分文没有。一家电视机厂建厂十年没有利润，这种毫无生气的企业不是一具活尸吗？
    但那时没有大潮，只有一潭死水，因此我们还活着……况且那年头人们刚经历了十年浩劫，既厚道又乐观，还怕死吗？
    回忆起“文革”，耳畔忽然飘来一句“样板戏”，“想要逼死我，瞎了你眼窝……我不死，我要活……”
    张宗舜想着想着，叹了一口气。
    　　　　二
    要想扭转厂里严重亏损的局面，就必须全力以赴地争取把大量积压的黑白机推销出去，用黑白机的盈利来弥补彩电的亏损。尽管这是很不正常的畸型现象，但若要度过１９８７年这道难关，除此别无其他选择。
    自从“华日”牌彩电上马以后，黑白机的推销工作在厂里受到冷落，以往的销售渠道被缺乏远见的决策堵死，而新的销售渠道又没有及时开辟。负责销售的厂里有关部门的工作热情受到挫伤，有关奖励制度也没有完善。
    推销是一门艺术。张宗舜痛下决心，上任后要做的首要工作，就是在厂销售部门燃起一把熊熊大火。他在厂务办公会上慷慨陈词：“销售工作是关系到我们厂能否在竞争中生存下去的关键，应该毫不迟疑地立即确立‘立足本省、开发西南、保住东北、面向全国’的战略方针，改变以往销售不力的局面，以全国二、三级供应采购站为依托，其它渠道为辅，发挥我们吃苦耐劳的优势，强化销售，以质量和服务打开市场……”他立即决定把那些富有经验的离退休老同志请回来，恳请他们临危受命，为挽救工厂发光发热。与此同时，从厂里一些部门抽调得力人员，充实销售部门。
    此时正是临近旧历年关，处处爆竹轰鸣。不少一年下来盈利的企业的职工正欢天喜地地张贴春联，选购年货，准备庆贺新春。作为一家严重亏损企业的负责人，张宗舜目睹此情此景该是何等窘迫！但他在窘迫中也看到了机会，决心背水一战，令所有销售人员立即分头出发，南至深圳，北到丹东，利用春节前夕其他厂家在推销上懈怠这一薄弱环节，迅速疏通各地过去已有的销售渠道，并通过感情联络着手建立新的销售网点。
    于是，在茫茫雪国，在莽莽大漠，一支支销售小分队出现了……同时，三支负有推销任务的售后服务队也迅速组成，以云贵川三省的偏僻山区为重点目标，涉水跋山，远征在长城内外、西南山地。他们当中有工厂的领导，有白发苍苍的老同志，有精明强干的年轻人。老少齐心，同舟共济。终于一个多月后捷报从各地纷纷传来：４０天里共销售黑白机３１０３５台。
    柳暗花明，工厂有了转机。张宗舜鼓励大家趁热打铁，分秒必争，继续强化销售。半年时间过去了，销售部门以惊人的效率推销出黑白机１３４０００台，几乎是全厂全年黑白机生产计划的总和，亏损终于变成了盈利。一场几乎导致破产的狂潮开始平息了。
    　　　　三
    张宗舜的自我意识是清醒的。他心中有数：无论是乱石穿空、惊涛拍岸，还是清风徐来、水波不兴，作为厂长，我首先都要明确一点：我是在水里。明白了这一点就明白了天下事，就理解了商品经济大潮的汹涌无情。聪明人应该把握时机，去冲浪，去弄潮，至少做“轻舟”不做“沉舟”。１９８７年，老天有眼，放我一次“胜利大逃亡”。今后怎么办？
    今后５年对电视机厂来说意味着什么？再有５年，中国国内的彩电市场将趋于饱和。新的竞争危机，新的生与死考验将再一次降临在“华日”厂头上。居安思危，到那时竞争真的只停留在互利互惠，共存共荣的基础上吗？竞争中真的没有倒下的一方吗？与国内同行业厂家比较，“华日”是个袖珍型的小厂。它起步晚，产量低，因此处处显出势单力薄；但它又起点高，技术新，国内大多数彩电都不具备它后来居上引进的“国际两块集成电路板”的先进技术。在这优劣两种因素并存的情况下，今后“华日”厂又如何继续生存与发展？
    也许，５年以后张宗舜不再是厂长了。如果已经另有高就或者辞职改行，人去楼空，人走茶凉，那也值得为后人担忧，为后人担当风险吗？少操点闲心，多发点奖金，岂不可以平安渡日并赢得口碑？
    那也要闯！对张宗舜来说，男儿生当带吴钩，岁月像潮水一样流走，唯有拚搏求索的渴望不曾更改，唯有改革图强，奋力开拓的意志不曾动摇。张宗舜向他的同事们吐露了衷肠：我们是共产党员，不能满足现状不思进取，而要具有“前人种树，后人乘凉”的博大襟怀。新的决策终于由集体做出了：
    ——筹备成立华日电器集团公司。以“华日”牌系列产品为龙头，与贵州乃至西南各成员厂进行专业化协作，使企业生产方式从小而全的封闭型向多边协作的开放型过渡，通过紧密联合构成企业扩大规模经济的可靠依托；
    ——通过对外厂的有偿兼并，迅速改建一条年产５０万台彩电、黑白机兼容的生产作业线，使企业在加强自身生产能力的同时增加产品在国内外市场上的竞争能力。同是，尽一切力量促进新品开发和向技术进步要效益；
    ——占领海南这个窗口，买进一家曾经组装过电视机的小厂，利用国家对海南省的优惠政策，工贸结合，从而滚雪球似的积累资金和技术，搞点“小进小出”，力争参与国际间的技术交换和市场分工。
    这三条决策经过不懈的努力已经开始有了眉目。华日电器集团公司筹备工作已告就绪；对贵阳南明耐火材料厂的有偿兼并业已完成；海南华日电器公司开张伊始就开始盈利。当１９８８年除夕的钟声鸣响时，张宗舜正坐在出差归来的火车上。他边吃着盒饭边想，今年这盘棋大概是走活了。
    　　　　四
    一首《春江花月夜》，把江潮、春月点染得何其风流！张若虚笔下的“潮”是美的。李白笔下的“潮”，也是美的。１９８８年，涌动在贵州电视机厂的商品生产大潮，如果套用《红楼梦》的一句话来形容，也可谓“虽无十分姿色，却也生得不俗”。这一年，贵州电视机厂共完成工业总产值２亿元，其中“华日”牌彩电全年创汇１３００万美元。与此同时，“华日”牌彩电金榜有名，首次荣获第二届全国彩电质量评比一等奖，并顺利通过“部优”测试。只是由于生产规模太小，自身产量过低，尚无法达到“国优”的标准。
    那么，今年呢？今年，１９８９年，贵州电视机厂将在新中国电子工业史上写下不平凡的一页，“华日”牌彩电将一次向欧洲国家出口１０万台，这是国内前所未有的纪录。
    １９８９年，贵州电视机厂将首家推出２１英寸直角遥控彩电。
    １９８９年，贵州电视机厂将开始生产“华日”牌录像机并投放市场。
    改革的大潮在中国已经奔腾了１０年。１０年来，贵州电视机厂生产的电视机，有“海燕”牌，有“海鹰”牌，有“华日”牌。说来无论“海燕”也好，“海鹰”也罢，实际上都根本不曾飞越大海一步，只是表达了夜郎人民善良美好的愿望而已。唯有经过引进生产的“华日”，几经坎坷，潮起潮落之间，终于成功地冲出了夜郎国，走向了世界。
    激动之余，人们总想说点什么。
    说什么呢？
    历史是一出喜剧。
