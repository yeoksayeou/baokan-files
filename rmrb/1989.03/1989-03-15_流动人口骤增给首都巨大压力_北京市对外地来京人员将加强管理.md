The sudden increase in the floating population this spring has put immense pressure on the capital. Beijing's public buses and trams are already operating beyond their capacity.

According to a Beijing municipal official, this year in January and February, the capital saw an average increase of over ten thousand people per day compared to the same period last year. Currently, the city's floating and temporary residents number over 1.3 million, and this number continues to rise. Apart from those who come to visit relatives, seek medical treatment, or transfer trains, 80% of the out-of-town residents come to Beijing to work, do business, or engage in domestic services.

This official pointed out that these out-of-town residents have played a positive role in activating the market, promoting the economy, and conveniencing the lives of the people. However, they have also brought some management difficulties to the city. First, Beijing already has about 300,000 unemployed individuals and workers who have been laid off due to enterprise restructuring. Adding the million-strong floating population has exacerbated the employment contradictions and social instability. Second, it has increased the burden on housing, transportation, grain, and oil supply. For example, Beijing residents enjoy 550 yuan in municipal fiscal subsidies per person annually for eating, living, and transportation. Therefore, these floating residents receive at least 400 million yuan in "invisible subsidies" from the municipal fiscal budget. Third, among the floating population, there is a group of wandering criminals who have caused some harm to the capital's public security. Fourth, city residents are suffering from overcrowded public transportation. It is reported that for every additional 10,000 people, 10 more buses are needed. A million-strong floating population would require an additional thousand public buses. Due to traffic congestion, 123 people died in traffic accidents last year, accounting for 1/8 of the total traffic fatalities in the city.

This official stated that the municipal government will organize the public security, transportation, industry and commerce, municipal administration, health, and neighborhood committees to use economic, administrative, and legal means to carry out comprehensive management.

### 流动人口骤增给首都巨大压力  北京市对外地来京人员将加强管理

　　流动人口骤增给首都巨大压力
    北京市对外地来京人员将加强管理
    本报讯  记者赵兴林报道：今春以来，北京街头的流动人口猛增，公共汽车、电车已超负荷运转。
    据北京市负责人介绍，今年一、二月首都平均每天比去年同期增加十多万人。目前，全市流动与暂住人口达１３０多万，而且有继续增长的势头。除一部分是来探亲访友、治病、中转换车以外，８０％的外地人员是来京务工、经商或从事家庭劳务的。
    这位负责人指出，这些外地来京人员对活跃市场、繁荣经济、方便群众生活，起了一些积极作用，但也给城市管理带来一些麻烦。一、本来北京市各种待业人员和企业优化劳动组合下岗的职工共３０来万人，加上外地的百万流动大军，劳力市场过剩，加深了就业矛盾和社会不安定因素。二、给住房、交通、粮油和副食供应加重了负担。比如：北京居民吃、住、行等，每人每年享受５５０元的市财政补贴。那么，这些流动人员，市财政“无形补贴”至少４亿元。三、流动人员中夹杂着一批流窜案犯，对首都治安造成了一定的危害。四、市内乘车者苦不堪言。据介绍，如果按市区公共汽车、电车的常规载客量计算，每增加一万人，需要增加１０辆汽车。百万流动大军，就得再增加上千辆公共汽车。由于交通拥挤，去年有１２３人死于交通事故，相当于全市交通死亡人数的１／８。
    这位负责人表示，市政府将组织公安、交通、工商、市政、卫生、街道居委会等，运用经济的、行政的、法律手段，开展综合治理。
