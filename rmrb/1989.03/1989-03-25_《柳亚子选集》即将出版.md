Many of these pieces are unpublished manuscripts and original copies, accompanied by precious handwritten notes, seals, and photographs.

The initial suggestion to compile this book came from Zhou Enlai, and the final endorsement was provided by Deng Yingchao. The book will be published by the People's Publishing House in the near future.
