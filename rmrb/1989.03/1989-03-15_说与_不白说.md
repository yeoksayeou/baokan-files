Title: Speaking and "Speaking in Vain"

People daring to speak out is an important sign of a society opening up. Over the past decade of reform, everyone has spoken freely, without holding back, gradually feeling a relaxed atmosphere, and their moods have become more comfortable. The people have been able to express their opinions on many issues, from major ones like national construction and social life to minor ones like the various troubles in their own units. They can speak openly and frankly, venting their feelings and grievances in public, which is indeed progress. This is a normal state as society transitions from being closed to open.

A society that appears silent on the surface but has underlying turmoil is not a good sign. When everyone talks freely and discusses various issues, that is a sign of prosperity.

When the people have something to say and express it freely, from the leadership's perspective, it allows them to understand the people's sentiments, listen to the people's voices, seek consensus, and shorten the distance between the two, making decisions more in line with the people's wishes and demands. For the people, it enhances their sense of participation and self-awareness. The saying among the people, "If you don't say it, it's for nothing," can also be seen as a strong manifestation of this participatory consciousness. At the same time, when the people vent their pent-up frustrations and grievances, it is like opening a floodgate, which can add to social stability.

It seems that people have few inhibitions about speaking out. However, what is more concerning is the effect after speaking out? It seems that the results are still not satisfactory. Therefore, people feel that "speaking out is in vain." The reasons are mainly twofold: First, the people speak out, the leaders accept it, and the work improves, or if it cannot be done immediately, measures are being taken to solve it, but it is not publicly explained to the people; or the people's suggestions are not correct and cannot be implemented, and there is no explanation. Second, you say your part, and I do my part, remaining unchanged and not improving. Unless it is a dead bureaucrat, the first situation is likely more common.

"If speaking out is in vain," it may cause the people to become disheartened and silent, blocking another channel for expression, and the society will lack vitality; it may also lead to more complaints and dissatisfaction, eroding people's will to fight. If "speaking out is not in vain," the original problems are solved, new problems arise, and there is more to say, making the act of speaking enter a new level. In the process of speaking, confidence and cohesion are enhanced, and social life enters a virtuous cycle.

The current issue is how to create a social mechanism where the people's "speaking out is not in vain." This brings us back to the old topic: increasing transparency and openness. That is, for the issues discussed among the people, timely explanations and accounts should be given: which issues have been resolved and what the results are; which issues are being addressed and the progress; which issues can be done but have not been implemented; which issues are currently difficult to achieve and need understanding; which issues are misunderstandings or even rumors. If explanations and doubts can be resolved through the media or dialogues between leaders and the people, the people will be satisfied. This is probably also an essential part of the education of the situation. Speaking of dialogues, a few more words can be added. This measure seemed to be popular for a while but has recently become less so. When will some effective measures in social life become institutionalized and enduring? This may also be a topic of systemic reform.

### 说与“不白说”

　　说与“不白说”
    陶铠
    人民群众敢于讲话，是社会开放的一个重要标志。改革十年来，大家有话直说，口没遮拦，逐步感受到一种宽松的气氛，心情也日益舒畅。人民群众对大至国家建设、社会生活的许多问题都能各抒己见，发表看法；小至对本单位的诸多麻烦都能直言不讳，一吐为快；心里话、牢骚话都可以在大庭广众之下曝光，自然是一种进步。这是社会从封闭走向开放的一种正常状态。
    一个社会，表面鸦雀无声，地火却在滚滚运行，不是好兆头。大家七嘴八舌，议论纷纷，才是走向兴旺的路标。
    群众有话要说，一吐为快地说出来，从领导方面来讲，可以及时体察民情，倾听群众的呼声，寻求共识，缩短两者之间的距离，使决策更符合群众的愿望和要求；对群众来讲，增强了参与感和主体意识。群众中流传的“不说白不说”，也可以看作是这种参与意识的强烈表现。同时，群众把心中的憋闷、不平宣泄出来，对社会生活来说，犹如开闸放水，会增加一份稳定。
    说，看来大家已经少有顾忌了。然而，更关心的是说了以后效果又如何？看来似乎还不尽如人意。所以，大家又有“说了也白说”之感。其原因不外乎有二：其一，群众说了，领导者也接受了，工作也改进了，或者一时办不到，正在采取措施加以解决，但没有公开向群众讲明；或者群众说的并不对，不可能照办，也没有进行解释；其二，你说你的，我行我的，依然故我，不思改进。除非遇上死官僚主义者，恐怕前者情况居多。
    “说了也白说”，有可能造成群众心灰意懒，消沉而缄口，从另一个方面堵住言路，社会从此缺乏生机；也可能“白说还得说”，牢骚、不满风起，消蚀人的斗志。如果“说了不白说”，原先说的问题解决了，新的问题又出现了，又得说，使说不断进入新的层次，在说的中间增强了信心和凝聚力，社会生活便进入良性循环状态。
    目下的问题是如何创造一种群众“说了不白说”的社会机制。这又回到了老话题上：增加透明度、公开性。也就是说，对群众中议论的问题，及时作出有理有据的说明和交待：哪些是已经解决了的，成效如何；哪些是正在着手解决的，进展情况怎样；哪些是可以做到而没有抓紧实施的；哪些是目前尚有困难还难于做到，需要谅解的；哪些是属于误解甚至是谣传的。如能通过新闻媒介或领导人与群众对话，解答和释疑，群众是会感到满意的。这大概也是形势教育的题中应有之义。说到对话，不妨赘言几句，此举似乎曾经时兴一阵，近来似乎有点冷落了。什么时候社会生活中一些行之有效的措施能形成制度，久行不衰呢？这或许又是体制改革的话题了。
