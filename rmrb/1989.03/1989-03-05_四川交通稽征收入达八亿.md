Sichuan's traffic supervision and collection revenue exceeds eight billion yuan. Our reporter Luomaocheng reports from Chengdu: Sichuan Province's traffic supervision and collection personnel are known for their integrity and clean governance. Ninety percent of the province's supervision and collection bureaus and offices have been recognized as civilized units by local governments. Last year, the revenue from supervision and collection surpassed the eight billion yuan mark, becoming an important source of revenue for Sichuan Province.

The primary responsibility of the supervision and collection work is to levy road maintenance fees and vehicle purchase additional fees. Over the past few years, the 1,200 supervision and collection personnel across the province have upheld the law impartially, eliminating many loopholes.
