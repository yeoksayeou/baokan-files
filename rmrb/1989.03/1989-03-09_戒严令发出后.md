Martial Law Declared

At 19:00 on March 7, the martial law decree issued by the State Council spread instantly throughout Lhasa. According to the Constitution, this is the first time martial law has been declared in a turbulent region since the founding of the People's Republic of China 39 years ago.

Almost simultaneously, police, armed police, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army completed their assembly and quickly moved to their designated positions. On Linqiao Road (the outer ring road of the city), police cars sped past, and the main thoroughfares were now guarded by soldiers with submachine guns. Some individuals of unknown identity attempted to cross the cordon before the martial law decree took effect, but it was too late.

At 22:00, the Autonomous Region Party Committee's Propaganda Department dispatched three propaganda vehicles, which broadcast the martial law decree issued by the State Council and the first, second, and third orders of the regional government over loudspeakers.

At 22:30, the reporter accompanied one of the propaganda vehicles as it traveled along Linqiao Road. Looking north, the residential areas around Barkhor Street were lit up. Some people opened their windows to listen to the broadcast. Others threw a few stones from the shadows, making the vehicle's roof rattle.

At 23:30, the propaganda vehicle reached the intersection of Beijing East Road, where the armed police were arriving at their designated positions as required. About a hundred armed police officers stood in formation as their commander read out the "Six Regulations for Civilized Duty." They then split into small teams and marched west along Beijing East Road. The quiet street was littered with smoldering piles of ash, and there were over 40 burned bicycles and tricycles.

At midnight on March 8, exactly when the martial law decree took effect, the reporter arrived at the Barkhor Street police station. The first joint police and armed police team to capture rioters set off. The reporter followed the team into a narrow alley in the southwest of Barkhor Street. The team stopped in front of an old building on Lupu Road and knocked on a small door. A male rioter, seeing the situation, burst into tears and begged for mercy. In the neighboring building, another rioter, upon seeing the arrest warrant, initially pretended to be asleep in bed and then tried to act calm. His wife pushed him, saying, "Hurry up and get dressed. I told you not to go, but you insisted."

At 8:00 on the morning of March 8, the sun had not yet risen above the golden roof of the Jokhang Temple, and pedestrians began to appear on the streets. The duty personnel, who had not slept all night, were checking vehicles and pedestrians according to the government's third order. The reporter asked a person who had just passed through several checkpoints on his way to work if it was inconvenient. "Inconvenient? It gives me a sense of security. The riots lasted three days, and I was 'confined' for three days as well."

At 10:00 in the morning, as the reporter walked through the city, he was checked at every intersection. A short distance required six identity checks. At the intersection of Qingnian Road, a soldier from Sichuan patiently explained to passersby. Some people simply held their IDs out without putting them back in their pockets.

At 2:00 in the afternoon, most of the shops that had not been burned or looted remained closed. The Longwangtan Market was not as crowded as usual. The reporter asked an elderly couple who had come to buy meat, "Has martial law caused any inconvenience in your daily life?" The old man raised his voice to reply, "Temporary inconveniences are for long-term stability."

In the afternoon, as the reporter left Barkhor Street, he saw several Buddhist devotees circumambulating the temple.

### 戒严令发出后

　　戒严令发出后
    本报记者  卢小飞
    ３月７日１９时，国务院发布的戒严令瞬间传遍拉萨。根据宪法规定，对某一局势动荡的地区发布戒严令，这还是中华人民共和国成立３９年来的第一次。
    几乎同一时刻，公安、武警和人民解放军战士完成集结，迅速进入预定岗位。林廓路（城区外环路）上，一辆辆警车呼啸而过，主要通道已站上身挎冲锋枪的解放军战士，一些不明身份的人想在戒严令正式实行前穿过警戒线，但是已经迟了。
    ２２时刚过，自治区党委宣传部组织的３台宣传车分头出动，高音喇叭里传出国务院发布的戒严令和区人民政府的第１、２、３号令。
    ２２时３０分，记者随乘一辆宣传车行进在林廓路上，向北望去，八廓街一带居民区灯光闪烁。有人打开窗子倾听广播。也有人从暗处扔来几块石头，砸得车顶嘣嘣直响。
    ２３时３０分，宣传车行至北京东路路口，正是武警部队按要求到达指定地点的时间，百十名武警战士列队听首长宣读完“文明执勤的６条规定”后，分成小分队沿北京东路西行，静寂的路上一堆堆灰烬还冒着青烟，被烧毁的自行车和三轮车竟有４０多辆。
    ３月８日零时整戒严令实行之刻，记者来到八廓街派出所，公安、武警配合搜捕骚乱分子的第一小分队整队出发。记者随着小分队走进八廓街西南的一条曲巷，小分队停在鲁普路边一幢旧楼下，敲开一道小门。一名男性骚乱分子见势不妙，大哭起来，连连告饶。邻楼的另一名骚乱分子，见到公安人员出示逮捕证，先是赖在被窝里装傻，尔后又故作镇静。他妻子推了他一把：“快穿衣服，叫你不要去你偏去。”
    ３月８日早晨８时，太阳还没爬上大昭寺的金顶，街头陆续出现行人，一夜未眠的执勤人员正在按照政府的第３号令盘查过往车辆和行人。记者问一位刚刚过了几道岗来上班的人是否麻烦？“麻烦？有安全感哪。骚乱三天，我也‘软禁’了三天。”
    上午１０时，记者在城区行走，每过一个路口就接受一次证件检查，不长的一段路竟验证６次。青年路口一位操四川口音的武警战士耐心地向过往行人作着解释，有人干脆手拿证件不再放回兜里。
    下午２时，绝大多数未被烧、抢的商店依然没有开门。龙王潭菜市场不像往昔那样拥挤。记者问一对来买肉的老人：“戒严后生活上有些什么不便吗？”老汉提高嗓门回答：“暂时的不便是为了长治久安。”
    下午，当记者离开八廓街时，看到几位佛教信徒又在这里转经了。
