	700 million people in China affected by tobacco harms
	Drafting of anti-smoking law underway

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 21 (Reporter Zhu Shilong) The number of people in China affected by tobacco harm has reached 700 million. The drafting of an anti-smoking law is currently underway. This information was revealed in a report by the National People's Congress Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee on the review of proposals submitted to the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress.

	The report states that during the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, four proposals were submitted calling for the enactment of an anti-smoking law. The Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee of the National People's Congress sought opinions from the Ministry of Health, the Chinese Medical Association, the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medical Science, and the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration during the review of these proposals. The Chinese Academy of Preventive Medical Science reported that there are approximately 250 million smokers in the country. Including passive smokers, the number of people directly or indirectly affected by tobacco harm reaches 700 million. If smoking is not controlled, by 2025, China will have 2 million deaths annually from smoking-related diseases. The State Tobacco Monopoly Administration proposed several measures to reduce tobacco harm. The Chinese Medical Association believes that enacting such a law is necessary and timely. The Ministry of Health and the Patriotic Health Campaign Committee have decided to organize a drafting group to begin the drafting of the anti-smoking law.

　　我国七亿人受烟草危害        
    限制吸烟法草案正在拟订
    新华社北京３月２１日电  （记者朱世龙）我国受烟草危害的人数达７亿，限制吸烟法草案起草工作正着手进行。这是全国人大教育科学文化卫生委员会审议七届全国人大一次会议代表提出的议案的报告中透露的。
    报告中说，在七届全国人大一次会上，有４件议案提出要制定限制吸烟法。全国人大教科文卫委员会在审议这些议案时征求了卫生部、中华医学会、中国预防医学科学院、国家烟草专卖局的意见。中国预防医学科学院反映，全国吸烟者约２．５亿人，加上被动吸烟者，直接或间接受到烟草危害的达７亿人。对吸烟如不加以控制，到２０２５年，我国每年将有２００万人死于与吸烟有关的疾病。国家烟草专卖局提出了降低烟草危害的若干措施。中华医学会认为，制定这样一项法律是必要的、及时的。卫生部和爱国卫生运动委员会已决定组织起草小组，着手进行限制吸烟法草案的起草工作。
