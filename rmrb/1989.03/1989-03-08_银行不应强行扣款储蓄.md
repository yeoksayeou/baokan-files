Since last November, our newspaper has received letters from readers in Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tianjin, and Gansu provinces and autonomous regions, reporting that local branches of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China have been forcing employees of various enterprises and institutions to save money. Some banks have forcibly deducted 10% to 50% of each employee's salary to issue prize-saving coupons or fixed-term deposit books. Some banks have forced individual business owners to deposit thousands of yuan. Some banks have proposed that enterprises needing loans must raise funds from their employees and deposit the funds into the bank. The public is very dissatisfied with these practices by the banks. For this reason, our reporter interviewed relevant officials from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.

The official said that the practice of forcing employees to save is a violation of savings policies and is entirely wrong. According to this official, the main reasons for this situation are that some local governments, in order to solve the problem of insufficient funds, have required banks to do this; some enterprises, when raising funds from employees, do not adopt the principle of voluntariness but instead distribute the burden to each employee. In November last year, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China issued a notice to all provincial, municipal, and autonomous region branches, clearly stipulating that all levels of banks must firmly implement the principle of voluntary savings deposits and prevent the adoption of coercive orders, falsification, and mandatory distribution in the work of attracting savings. Once discovered, such practices must be immediately stopped and corrected. For local governments that require banks to forcibly deduct employees' salaries for savings, banks should do a good job of propaganda and explanation to government departments and refuse to execute, and if necessary, report to higher-level banks.

This official also said that some banks' practice of forcing employees to save by violating the principle of voluntary deposits is inappropriate. However, the enthusiasm of some bank employees to absorb savings in order to recover currency and increase deposit amounts is understandable. Last year, due to price increases, many places in our country experienced a rush to buy goods. Many depositors withdrew large amounts of money from banks, causing a significant drop in bank deposits. Relevant state departments immediately took a series of measures, which helped the deposit amounts to rise somewhat. In the next two years, the focus of our country's reforms is to improve the economic environment, rectify economic order, and effectively control price increases. The financial sector must control the amount of currency issued and maintain credit balance. However, the contradiction of tight funds is difficult to resolve in the short term. Therefore, it is hoped that the public will consider the overall situation, understand the difficulties of the state, and actively save money for the reform.

It is understood that at present, residents hold a large amount of cash, and many individual business owners hold cash without depositing it. The financial sector should, under the principle of voluntary deposits, actively do a good job of propaganda and mobilize those who have the ability to save to participate in savings, sharing the joys and hardships with the state and jointly overcoming difficulties.

### 银行不应强行扣款储蓄

　　银行不应强行扣款储蓄
    去年１１月以来，本报陆续收到江西、河南、湖南、黑龙江、内蒙古、天津、甘肃等省、市、自治区的一些读者来信，反映当地工商银行强迫一些企事业单位的职工储蓄的情况。有的银行强行扣除企事业单位每个职工１０％至５０％的工资，发给有奖储蓄券或者定期存折；有的银行强迫每个个体户必须存款数千元；有的银行提出：需要贷款的企业必须向职工集资，并将集资款存入银行。对于银行的这些做法，群众很不满意。为此，记者采访了中国工商银行的有关负责同志。
    这位负责同志说，强迫职工储蓄的做法，是违反储蓄政策的，是十分错误的。据这位负责人分析，造成这种状况的主要原因是，有的地方政府为了解决当地资金不足的问题，要求银行这样做；有的企业向职工集资时，不是采取自愿的原则，而是摊派到每个职工身上。去年１１月，中国工商银行向各省、市、自治区分行下发通知，明确规定，各级银行必须坚决贯彻执行储蓄存款自愿的原则，防止在吸收储蓄工作中采取强迫命令、弄虚作假、搞硬性摊派等不符合政策的做法，一经发现，必须立即制止和纠正。对于当地政府要求银行强扣职工工资储蓄的，银行应向政府部门做好宣传解释工作，并拒绝执行，必要时，要向上级银行反映。
    这位负责人还说，一些银行违背存款自愿的原则，强行让职工储蓄的做法是不妥当的。然而，一些银行工作人员为了回笼货币，增加存款额而积极吸收储蓄的心情是可以理解的。去年，由于物价上涨，我国不少地方出现了抢购风。许多储户纷纷从银行提取大量存款，以致银行的存款额大幅度下降。国家有关部门立即采取了一系列措施，才使存款额有所回升。今明两年，我国的改革重点是治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，有效控制物价上涨。金融部门必须控制货币发行量，保持信贷平衡。然而，资金紧张的矛盾一时又难以解决，因此，希望群众顾全大局，体谅国家的困难，为改革而积极存款。
    据了解，目前居民手中持有大量现金，许多个体户持币不存。金融部门在坚持存款自愿的原则下，应积极做好宣传工作，动员有能力存款的人参加储蓄，与国家同甘共苦，共渡难关。
