The novel *Black Soul* is a long-form work by Ní Jǐngxiáng, published by Huáchéng Publishing House. In the 23rd year of the Guangxu era, Germany invaded Jiaozhou Bay, forcing the Qing court to sign the Jiaozhou Bay Leased Territory Treaty, handing over mining and road-building rights in Shandong to foreigners. Even the sole national mining enterprise, the Zaozhuang Zhongxing Mining Bureau, was forced to cease operations.

The novel is set against the backdrop of the Zaozhuang Zhongxing Coal Mining Company and depicts the struggles of its general manager, Zhu Lianfen, to establish a national industry. This nationalist capitalist, who emerged from the womb of feudal bureaucracy, despite his cunning and strategy, was ultimately unable to save the Zhongxing Company from collapse in the face of powerful adversaries. He himself was also dismissed from his position.

This is a dark history that embodies the blood, sweat, and tears of patriotic heroes and countless miners. It portrays the struggle between the tender shoots of national capitalism and the decaying yet tenacious specter of feudalism. Meanwhile, the entangled love affairs add a romantic hue to the harsh political struggles.

　　《黑魂》〔长篇小说〕
    作者  倪景翔  花城出版社出版
    光绪二十三年，德国入侵胶州湾，迫使清廷签订胶澳租界条约，将山东开矿修路权拱手让于外人，唯一的民族矿业枣庄中兴矿局也宣告停业。
    小说以枣庄中兴煤矿公司为背景，描写了公司总经理朱莲芬创办民族工业的斗争历程。这位从封建官僚的胚胎里脱生出来的民族资本家，尽管他多智谋、有心计，击败了洋人和地方顽固势力，但是在强大的对手面前，他最终仍挽救不了中兴公司覆灭的命运，他自己也被革职。
    这是一部凝结着爱国志士心血与千万矿工泪水的黑色历史。从中，我们看到的是一株民族资本主义的嫩芽与腐朽却很顽强的封建幽灵之间的搏斗。同时，缠绵的爱情纠葛又给严酷的政治斗争蒙上一层浪漫的色彩。
