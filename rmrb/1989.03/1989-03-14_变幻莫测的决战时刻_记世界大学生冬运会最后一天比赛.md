The final day of the 14th World University Winter Games was March 12th. The "September" Winter Palace Sports Hall in Sofia was bustling with excitement as six short-track speed skating finals took place in the morning.

The short-track speed skating competitions were fiercely contested. Athletes competed on an approximately 120-meter rectangular track, requiring not only skilled cornering and straightaway sprinting techniques but also strategic execution. In the women's 1000-meter final, 19-year-old Jilin native Guo Hongru from China and her teammate Li Jinyan worked in close coordination. They first overtook the Soviet athlete Natalia, who had taken an early lead, and then left behind a Japanese competitor. By the last four laps, they were in the lead and maintained their position to the finish line. Guo Hongru won the gold medal with a time of 1 minute and 42.3 seconds.

The women's 3000-meter speed skating competition was even more intense, with eight athletes participating in the final. They had to complete 27 laps on the ice track. With only 10 laps remaining, Guo Hongru and Li Jinyan overtook the previously leading Soviet athlete Natalia and Italian athlete Maria Rosa. Natalia, unwilling to fall behind, launched a counterattack. While navigating a bend, due to their high speed, she and Guo Hongru both fell and were disqualified, losing their chance to win the gold. Li Jinyan, fighting alone, maintained her composure and stayed ahead, securing the gold medal with a time of 5 minutes and 42.79 seconds.

The final events were the two relay races. In the women's 3000-meter relay, featuring teams from China, the Soviet Union, the United States, and South Korea, a dramatic scene unfolded. The Chinese team, composed of Guo Hongru, Li Jinyan, Li Yan, and Wang Xiulan, worked in perfect harmony and displayed superior speed. From the start, they led by a wide margin, leaving the Soviet and South Korean teams a lap behind. When the Chinese team had only one lap left, the referee fired a warning shot, but the Soviet and South Korean athletes mistakenly thought they had reached the finish line. As a result, the Chinese team completed the full course in 4 minutes and 27.75 seconds to win the gold medal, while the Soviet and South Korean teams were disqualified for missing a lap. The U.S. team, having completed the full course, won the silver medal.

　　变幻莫测的决战时刻
    ——记世界大学生冬运会最后一天比赛
    ３月１２日是第１４届世界大学生冬季运动会比赛的最后一天，索非亚“九月”冬宫体育馆内热闹非凡，一上午进行了６项短跑道速滑的决赛。
    短跑道速滑比赛争夺激烈。运动员在周长约１２０米的长方形跑道上角逐，不仅要求有娴熟的弯道滑行和直道抢先的技术，而且战术运用也要得当。在首先进行的女子１０００米决赛中，１９岁的中国吉林姑娘郭宏茹和队友李金艳密切配合，先超过了一开始就领先的苏联姑娘纳塔妮亚，接着又甩下了一名日本女将，到最后４圈时处于领先，并领先滑到了终点。结果，郭宏茹以１分４２秒３的成绩获得金牌。
    女子３０００米速滑争夺更为激烈，共有８人参加决赛，她们要在冰道上滑行２７圈。在剩下最后１０圈时，郭宏茹和李金艳超过了原来遥遥领先的苏联选手纳塔妮亚和意大利选手玛丽娅·罗莎。纳塔妮亚不甘落后，又发起反攻。在滑行到弯道时，由于速度太快，她和郭宏茹一起滑倒摔出了跑道，结果两人都失去了夺冠良机。李金艳在孤军作战的情况下，稳住步法，始终保持领先，以５分４２秒７９的成绩夺得金牌。
    最后进行的是两个接力项目的决赛。有中、苏、美和南朝鲜４个队参加的女子３０００米接力赛出现了戏剧性场面。由郭宏茹、李金艳、李琰和王秀兰组成的中国队，配合默契，速度超群，从一开始就遥遥领先，把苏联队和南朝鲜队甩下了一圈多。当中国队还剩下最后一圈时，裁判鸣枪提醒，而苏联和南朝鲜选手却误认为自己也到了冲线时刻。结果中国队以４分２７秒７５滑完全程获得冠军，而苏联队和南朝鲜队因少滑一圈被取消资格，美国队因滑完了全程获得了银牌。
