Rural Students' Two Perspectives on Reading

Central Lecturer Team Henan Division  Liao Xiaoying

How do rural middle school students view the new "reading is useless" theory? From the perspectives of students in Class 192 (first year) at Henan's Weihui Normal School, we can get a glimpse. These students come from various counties and cities in the Xinxiang region, including Weihui City, Huixian City, Gujia, Changyuan, Fengqiu, and Yanjin. The situation of students dropping out of school to farm, do business, or work in these rural areas is quite severe. In the first class of the new semester, students discussed the new "reading is useless" theory based on their experiences during the winter vacation.

To get rich, one needs skills; look to the future and read more.

Zhang Suwei (Linxiang, Yanjin County): During the winter vacation, I heard that my former classmates had all dropped out of school. When I asked why, they said, "Reading is useless; it doesn't make money." I felt their vision was too narrow. Is reading really useless?

People nowadays like to calculate the economic benefits; whoever makes more money is considered more capable. If a high school graduate and an elementary school graduate both try to get rich, who will have more information? Who will get rich faster? If a knowledgeable person and an illiterate person both learn a new job, who will learn faster?

Reading is not useless; reading is the foundation for doing things.

Li Fengxia (Baquan Township, Huixian City): After we graduate, we will be elementary school teachers. Only by having cultural knowledge ourselves can we pass it on to our students. If we ourselves have no cultural knowledge, how can we teach? The speech and behavior of a knowledgeable person are very different from those of an uneducated person. Knowledge can also enrich one's spiritual life. During the vacation, if I don't read, I feel spiritually empty. However, in school, although I am tired, my spirit is full.

Sun Jingbo (Chengguan Township, Huixian City): In junior high school, I encountered difficulties with my English homework and wanted to ask my parents for help, but they didn't understand. At that moment, I thought, if parents can't help their children solve problems, they must feel bad. Therefore, to be a qualified parent, one must also have rich knowledge. From this point alone, I think reading is useful.

Ren Yanpu (Nao Li Township, Changyuan County): Reading is useful because reading is for one's future, not just for making money. If one doesn't read and is illiterate, it will be very difficult to make money outside. Some people think reading is useless, but why does the country spend so much money on schools? Some people think that if they can't advance to higher education, they might as well go back to farming, and reading is a waste of effort. Isn't farming also in need of culture? A person without culture doesn't even know how much fertilizer to use per mu of land, so how can they farm well?

Qu Yongjun (Sunxingcun Township, Weihui City): In rural areas, scientific farming, developing township enterprises, and getting rich all require scientific knowledge. If in the future we return to farming, we can apply the knowledge from our books to practice and engage in scientific farming. Knowing something is better than knowing nothing. People should not end up regretting, "In youth, we did not strive, in old age, we only sigh in sorrow."

Millionaires don't need books; reading is hard; few opportunities.

Ding Yuxia (Chengguan Township, Huixian City): My uncle was always the top student in his high school class, but due to family difficulties, he couldn't take the college entrance exam. As a result, he is now working at home. The knowledge he learned is useless, and now he has forgotten it all. From this, it seems that reading is useless.

Jia Jing (Zhaogang Township, Fengqiu County): On one hand, reading is very useful. If everyone's mind is empty, how can we achieve modernization? In rural areas, farming and sideline businesses also require scientific knowledge. On the other hand, reading is useless. For example, in our place, some millionaires have never read a book, but they can make a lot of money. They are richer than professors.

Zheng Fufeng (Zhangzhan Township, Changyuan County): Someone in the village calculated: if a person completes three years of junior high school and three years of senior high school, it will cost at least 3,000 yuan. If one doesn't go to school and starts making money now, one can earn more than ten yuan a day. By the time of high school graduation, one can earn tens of thousands of yuan. Even if one can go to college, the salary and bonus after graduation are only about a hundred yuan. If one graduates from high school and returns to farming, one has no skills and can only till the land. Therefore, reading is useless.

Gao Xiangyu (Qicheng Township, Fengqiu County): My father is an old teacher. In our family of five siblings, four have been admitted to vocational schools or universities. In the eyes of the villagers, our family is a "scholarly household." But who would have thought that our family's life is very difficult? My three brothers and sisters, although they are already working, their salaries can only maintain their own families' lives. My father, mother, second brother, and I can only rely on our family's five or six mu of land and my father's more than 100 yuan salary to live. The grain we harvest is just enough to eat, and we don't have money to repair the house. My parents, in order to let us study, never ask us to work in the fields. I have thought many times: if we siblings had not gone to school and worked at home, my parents would have been able to enjoy their lives long ago.

Zhou Yongmei (Menggang Township, Changyuan County): At home, I often hear my mother sigh to my brother: "Look at others the same age as you, they all have children. You are still going to college. Even if you go to college, it doesn't guarantee a job. It's all about spending money, and we can't even afford to build a hall or find a wife." Because of this, my brother often feels depressed. Sometimes, he is with friends who do business, seeing them spend money freely, and he feels very poor. At this age, he has not given a penny to the family, still relying on his parents to support him, and he feels ashamed. He has thought about quitting school several times, but he can't give up his books. In this way, he can't study well, and he hasn't earned a penny.

Yang Zhiyi (Shuima Township, Weihui City): The quality of teaching in our village's primary and secondary schools is extremely poor. Among the teachers, some are local officials' children who have just finished or even not finished junior high school. The teachers smoke and drink all day, and their hearts are not on teaching. During festivals, they also find excuses to ask students for money. The textbook and miscellaneous fees are more expensive than in other villages. A large number of students, because they didn't get into junior high school, returned to farming. In the village, junior high school students have not had a single one admitted to a vocational school or senior high school in several years. I was able to get into a normal school only because I transferred to another village to study. The villagers all say this school is a "white stall." Is reading useful in such a school?

专栏：我看“新的读书无用论”

    农村学生两种眼光看读书
    中央讲师团河南分团  廖晓英
    农村中学生如何看待新的“读书无用论”呢？从河南卫辉师范学校１９２班（一年级）学生的观点中可以略见一斑。他们来自新乡地区的卫辉市、辉县市、获嘉、长垣、封丘、延津等地，这些县市农村的中小学生辍学务农、经商、打工的状况相当严重。新学期的第一堂课上，学生们就寒假期间的所见所闻，开展了一次对“新的读书无用论”的讨论。
    　　　　若要富　需技术　往远看　快读书
    张素伟（延津县林乡）：寒假回家，闻听过去的同学都不上学了，问其原因，回答说：读书没用，挣不了大钱。我感到他们的目光太短浅。读书到底有无用处呢？
    现在的人爱算经济帐，谁挣钱多谁有能耐。如果一个高中毕业生和一个小学毕业生同去致富，谁的信息灵呢？谁致富得快呢？如果让一个有知识的人和一个文盲去学一项新工作，谁又学得快呢？
    读书并非无用，读书是干事业的基础。
    李凤霞（辉县市百泉乡）：我们毕业以后是当小学教师的，自己有了文化知识，才能传播给学生。如果自己根本没有文化知识，怎能教学呢？一个有知识的人和一个没有任何知识的人的言谈举止也是大不一样的。知识还能丰富自己的精神生活。放假回家不看书，总觉得精神空虚，而在学校读书，虽然劳累，但精神很充实。
    孙静波（辉县市城关镇）：初中时，我做英语作业遇到难题，很想请求父母帮助，但他们不懂。这时我就想，做父母的如果不能为自己的孩子解决困难，心中一定不好受。所以，要想做一个合格的家长，也必须具备丰富的知识。仅从这一点来看，我就认为读书是有用的。
    任艳普（长垣县恼里乡）：读书是有用的，因为读书是为了自己的远大前途，而不仅仅是为了挣钱。若不读书，一字不识，即使出门挣钱也是很困难的。
    有人认为读书无用，那为什么国家还拿出那么多资金来办学校呢？有人认为不能升学，回家务农，读书是白费劲。难道种地就不需要文化吗？没有文化的人连每亩地用多少化肥都不知道，怎能种好地呢？
    屈永军（卫辉市孙杏村乡）：农村科学种田、发展乡镇企业、发家致富都需要科学知识。如果将来回家务农，我们可以把书本上的知识运用到实践中去，进行科学种田。学点知识总比不学强，人不要落到“少壮不努力，老大徒伤悲”的地步。
    　　　　万元户　不用书　读书苦　少出路
    丁玉霞（辉县市城关镇）：我的舅舅上高中时一直是班上的拔尖生，因为家里有困难，没能参加高考，结果，还不是在家里劳动？学习的知识一点没用上，现在已忘得一干二净。这样看来，读书又有什么用呢？
    贾靓（封丘县赵岗乡）：一方面，读书是很有用的，如果人人头脑里没有一点知识，那怎么能实现现代化呢？在农村种地、搞副业也都需要科学知识。但另一方面，读书又没啥用。比如说，我们那里有的万元户根本没读过书，可却能赚大钱，他们比教授要富得多。
    郑富峰（长垣县张占乡）：村里有人算过一笔帐：假如一个人上完三年初中再上三年高中，这几年至少要花去３０００多元钱。如果不上学从现在开始挣钱了，一天就能挣十多块钱，这样到高中毕业时就能挣几万块钱了。就算他能考上大学，毕业后，工资加奖金不过百十来元。如果高中毕业回家务农，啥技术也没有，也只能耕地，所以读书没用。
    高香玉（封丘县七城乡）：我爸爸是名老教师，我们家兄妹５人有４人考上了中专或大学。在乡里人看来，我们家可谓“书香门第”了。可谁知我家的生活非常拮据呢？我的３个哥哥姐姐虽已工作，但工资仅能维持各自一家的生活。剩下爸爸、妈妈、二哥和我，只能靠我家里的五六亩地和爸爸的１００多元工资生活。收的粮食只是够吃，想翻盖房子也没钱。父母为了让我们学习，从不指使我们下地干活。我不止一次地想：假如我们兄妹都不上学，在家劳动，那父母早就能坐下享福了。
    周咏梅（长垣县孟岗乡）：我在家常听母亲对哥哥叹道：看人家和你一般大的都有孩子了，你还考大学。考上大学也不包分配，净花钱，弄得家里连堂屋都盖不起，媳妇也说不上。为此，哥哥常常苦闷。有时，他和经商的同龄朋友在一起，看他们大手大脚地花钱，觉得自己很寒酸，这么大了，没给过家里一分钱，还靠父母养活，脸面上过不去。他几次想退学，可终究舍弃不了书本。这样，学也上不好，钱也没挣一分。
    杨志伟（卫辉市拴马乡）：我们村中小学的教学质量极差，教师当中有一些是刚上完甚至没上完初中的当地干部子女。教师们成天抽烟、喝酒，心不用在教学上。每逢节日还找借口向学生要钱，书杂费比别村的贵，大批的学生因没考上初中而回家务农。村里的初中生几年也没一个考上中专或高中的。我是因为转校到别村上学才考上了中等师范。村里人都说这学校是“白摆摊子”。在这样的学校中读书有用吗？
