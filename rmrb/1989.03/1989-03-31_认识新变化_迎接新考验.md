Recognizing New Changes and Facing New Challenges
Xing Chongzhi, Secretary of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee

Compared to the period before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the main changes in the social environment include: the shift from a closed system to comprehensive reform and opening up, changes in the system, changes in the ownership structure, changes in the distribution structure, changes in interest groups, and changes in the social cultural structure.

The new situation presents the Party with new challenges, mainly in the following areas: the test of firm beliefs, the test of fulfilling the Party's purpose, the test of updating concepts, the test of upholding Party principles, and the test of clean governance.

Currently, our Party is in a historical period of great transformation. Compared to the period before the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, what new changes have occurred in the social environment? Generally, they can be summarized into six aspects.

The shift from a closed system to comprehensive reform and opening up. Reform and opening up have broken through the rigid economic model, making the economy more dynamic and liberating the national spirit. However, reform and opening up have indeed brought a danger of corruption, creating a breeding ground and environment for corrupt practices.

Changes in the system. Reform has broken the overly centralized and unified model of the product economy and is transitioning towards a planned commodity economy and modern economy. Political system reform aims to change the long-standing practice of the Party and government not being separate, replacing it with a system where the Party and government are separate, thereby strengthening the Party's leadership and government functions.

Changes in the ownership structure. The state adheres to the public ownership as the mainstay while allowing private economy to supplement it. The single public ownership has developed into a multi-ownership structure with public ownership as the mainstay. Within the public ownership, the separation of ownership and management rights has led to various management methods. This has resulted in various ownership forms such as state-owned, collective-owned, individual-owned, cooperative, joint-stock, Sino-foreign joint ventures, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises, creating a situation where multiple economic components coexist.

Changes in the distribution structure. While maintaining the primary position of distribution according to work, other distribution principles are also allowed within the current policy framework. Legalization of various incomes such as operational income, risk income, investment income, and rental income has been permitted. The widening income gap among social members has led to differences in living standards and lifestyles.

Changes in interest groups. The development of the commodity economy and the coexistence of multiple economic components have significantly changed the economic status and income of social members. All these changes are continually altering the composition of social members, dividing them into different interest groups. The changes in the economic structure have led to the differentiation of class structure. Within different interest groups, there are contradictions that serve as both the main body of reform and progress and the carrier of the old system, exhibiting a wide range of contrasts.

Changes in the social cultural structure. While the excellent traditions of national culture have been further promoted, beneficial foreign cultures have also been absorbed. However, with the introduction of advanced science and technology, some inherently decadent ideologies, cultures, and lifestyles from the West have also infiltrated.

The new changes in the social environment and the new situations that have arisen present our Party with a high-difficulty test, making the Party organization and every Communist Party member face new and severe challenges.

Our country is a socialist society in the primary stage built on a foundation of poverty and backwardness. Due to the large population, weak base, poor foundation, and backward productivity, China's per capita GDP is still among the lowest in the world. Labor productivity and economic development speed are far behind developed countries. After opening up, some comrades, in comparing the two social systems horizontally, have overlooked the differences in development stages, confusing different stages of development with social systems, leading to doubts about whether the socialist system is better or the capitalist system is better. This has caused confusion and even wavering in the Party's ultimate goal. Whether to persist in realizing the lofty ideal of communism is a test.

Reform has adjusted the interests of various aspects of society, leading to conflicts, frictions, and collisions that affect everyone, including Communist Party members. Whether to continue adhering to the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly, selflessly sacrificing personal interests for the Party, the state, and the people, is another test.

Implementing the basic line of the Party in the primary stage of socialism, focusing on economic construction, and taking the development of productive forces as the starting point for reform and opening up, requires us to break away from old ideas and establish new ones. Reform and opening up, in terms of their nature and the breadth and depth of the social changes they have brought about, are another extensive social revolution and ideological revolution led by our Party after seizing power. Whether to consciously update our ideas to better engage in construction and reform is also a test.

Building socialism with Chinese characteristics will inevitably encounter some contradictions and difficulties. When such situations arise, can Communist Party members firmly uphold Party principles, strictly observe Party discipline, consider the overall situation, and safeguard the interests of the Party and the people? This is the fourth test.

Reform and opening up have injected new vitality into the Party's construction. However, with the development of the commodity economy, ideologies such as "everything for money" and "money worship" will also infiltrate the Party, giving rise to practices of using power for personal gain and other undesirable trends, leading to some corrupt practices within the Party. Whether to effectively resist corruption, maintain a clean style of work, and govern cleanly is the fifth test.

First, we must recognize these changes in the social environment and, based on these changes, focus on some fundamental aspects of Party building. This will enable our Party organization and Communist Party members to face and withstand these challenges, truly building our Party into a strong core leading the cause of socialist modernization.

　　认识新变化　迎接新考验
    中共河北省委书记  邢崇智
    同党的十一届三中全会以前相比，社会环境发生的主要变化有：由封闭到全面改革开放的变化，体制的变化，所有制结构的变化，分配结构的变化，利益集团的变化，社会文化结构的变化。
    新情况使党面临的新考验，主要表现在：坚定信念的考验，履行宗旨的考验，更新观念的考验，坚持党性原则的考验，廉洁持政的考验。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    我们党目前正处在一个历史性的大转变时期。与党的十一届三中全会以前相比，社会环境发生了一些什么新变化呢？大体上可以归纳为六个方面。
    由封闭到全面改革开放的变化。改革开放冲破了经济体制上的僵化模式，使经济活跃起来，也使民族精神获得了新的解放。但是，改革开放确实带来了一种腐败的危险，这种环境有滋生腐败现象的土壤和温床。
    体制的变化。改革打破了产品经济体制上过分集中统一的模式，正在向有计划的商品经济转变，向现代经济转变。进行政治体制改革，改变长期形成的党政不分、以党代政，实行党政分开，理顺党政关系，旨在加强党的领导和政府职能。
    所有制结构的变化。国家坚持公有制为主体，同时允许私有经济作为公有制经济的补充而存在。单一的公有制发展为以公有制为主体的多种所有制形式；公有制内部实行所有权和经营权分离，形成多种经营方式。这样，出现了全民所有制，集体所有制，个体所有制，合作经济，股份制，中外合资、合作，外商独资等多种所有制形式，形成了多种经济成份并存的局面。
    分配结构的变化。在保持按劳分配的主体地位的前提下，允许存在一些其它分配原则。在现行政策允许的范围内，经营收入、风险收入、投资收入、租赁收入等合法化了。社会成员收入档次的拉大，导致人们生活水平和生活方式上的差异。
    利益集团的变化。商品经济的发展、多种经济成份并存，社会成员的经济地位和收入也发生了很大变化。这一切不断改变着社会成员的构成，把社会成员分化成不同的利益集团。经济结构的变化造成阶级结构的分化。在不同的利益集团中，形成既是改革和前进的主体，又是维护旧体制的载体的具有大跨度反差的矛盾体。
    社会文化结构发生变化。民族文化的优良传统得到进一步发扬的同时，还吸收了外来的有益文化。但随着先进科学技术的引进，西方一些本质上腐朽的思潮、文化和生活方式也相随涌了进来。
    社会环境发生的这些新变化，出现的这些新情况，给我们党出了一张高难度的考卷，使党的组织以及每一个共产党员都面临着新的严峻的考验。
    我国是一个在贫穷落后的基础上建立起来的处于初级阶段的社会主义社会。由于人口多、底子薄、基础差，生产力落后，现在我国人均国民生产总值仍然居世界后列，劳动生产率和经济发展速度与发达国家相比，还有很大差距。实行开放以后，一些同志在两种社会制度的横向比较中，忽略了发展阶段的不同，把发展的不同阶段同社会制度混为一谈，产生了到底是社会主义制度好、还是资本主义制度好的疑虑，对党的最终目标感到迷茫，甚至发生动摇。实现共产主义的崇高理想，还要不要始终如一地坚持下去，这是一种考验。
    改革引起社会各方面利益关系的调整，由此而引起的矛盾、摩擦和碰撞，波及包括共产党员在内的每一个人。能否继续坚持全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，自觉地为了党和国家以及人民的利益牺牲个人利益，这是又一个考验。
    贯彻党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，以经济建设为中心，以发展生产力作为改革开放的出发点，对僵化的经济模式和政治体制的某些方面进行改革；对附加在社会主义制度上的错误东西加以清理；对有利于发展我国生产力的别国经验加以吸收，等等，都需要我们破除旧观念，树立新观念。改革开放就其性质和所引起的社会变革的广度和深度而言，是我们党继夺取政权之后所领导的又一次广泛的社会革命和思想观念的革命。能否自觉地实现观念的更新，以便更好地投身建设和改革，也是一个考验。
    建设具有中国特色的社会主义，也会产生一些矛盾，遇到一些困难。出现这种情况，共产党员能否坚定不移地坚持党性原则，严守党纪，顾全大局，维护党和人民的利益，这是第四个考验。
    改革开放给党的建设注入了新的活力。但另一方面，随着商品经济的发展，“一切向钱看”、“拜金主义”等思潮也会侵蚀到党的肌体，滋生以权谋私等不正之风，使党内出现某些腐败现象。能否有效地拒腐蚀，保持廉洁作风，清廉从政，这是第五个考验。
    首先要认识社会环境发生的这些变化，并针对这些变化，抓好党的建设中一些带根本性的工作，使我们党的组织和共产党员迎接和经受住这些考验，把我们党真正建设成为领导社会主义现代化事业的坚强核心。
