Recently, while in a store in Jiujiang, Jiangxi, the author attempted to purchase a watch strap and requested that the store install it. The young salesperson replied, “We don’t install straps for watches not purchased here.” Despite repeated pleas, the request was denied.

Installing a watch strap is a matter of a few cents and a few seconds, yet it causes inconvenience to the customer. On one hand, there are slogans like “The Customer is Supreme” and “Warm and Friendly Service,” but on the other hand, customers buying small items are treated coldly. This business practice not only goes against socialist professional ethics but also easily hurts customers' feelings. Ultimately, it affects the store's business and economic benefits. The pros and cons here are worth pondering for business operators.

### “不买手表，不装表带”

    “不买手表，不装表带”
    张桂辉
    日前，笔者在江西九江一家商店购买一条表带，付款时要求代装起来。年轻的营业员答道：“不在我们这里买的手表，不装表带。”我再次恳求亦无济于事。
    装一条表带，不过毛把钱、几十秒钟的事，却使顾客感到麻烦。一面是“顾客至上”、“热情服务”之类娓娓动听的标语口号，一面却给购买小商品的顾客以冷遇，这种经营作风不仅有悖于社会主义职业道德，而且容易伤害顾客的感情。到头来还影响商店的生意和经济效益。这里的利弊得失值得商业经营者深思。
