Title: Is Being a Soldier Humiliating?

The incident occurred at a military camp on the outskirts of Beijing.

On the evening of March 16th, around 6 PM, three local youths, after drinking, drove a 55-horsepower rubber-wheeled tractor directly towards the gate of a certain tank brigade's vehicle yard. The duty soldier, Ji Chunqi, stopped them and asked, "What are you doing? Please get off and register." The three youths responded rudely, "Who the hell are you?" They then forced the tractor into the yard. Ji feared an accident and locked the gate. When the three came out again, they argued with Ji and beat him. Ji retaliated with the chain he used to lock the gate. The brigade's political department deputy director, Zhou Xunping, criticized Ji for fighting back and ordered him to apologize to the youths.

This incident sparked discussions among the officers and soldiers.

	The Soldiers' Complaints

Ji apologized to the local youths but felt deeply wronged: he was just doing his duty and got beaten for it, and then got criticized by his superiors. He couldn't hold back his tears.

Many soldiers sympathized with Ji and started venting their frustrations:

"Last year, four of our soldiers were beaten on a public bus while out on duty. Now, even when we're not out, we still get beaten. The status of soldiers is getting lower and lower."

"Before enlisting, I admired the People's Liberation Army so much. I never thought that being a soldier would mean enduring humiliation."

"Nowadays, soldiers are looked down upon everywhere. On public buses, people push and shove, and no one says anything. If a soldier pushes back, rude comments come flying. If you don't push, you can't get back on time."

"Soldiers always stand on buses. Elderly people and women with children on buses prefer to stand near soldiers. Do you dare to sit?"

"We serve our duty as soldiers, not for the money. A monthly allowance of a hundred or twenty yuan is nothing to us. But some people in society think soldiers are shabby and uncouth. If we didn't enlist, we could make big money at home. But if everyone wants to make money, who will defend the country?"

"Sigh, I think soldiers are only valued when there's a war. There's a saying: we are the most lovable people when fighting a war, the most beloved when rescuing during disasters, and the most redundant when there's no war or disaster!"

	The Comforting Words from Fellow Soldiers

"Don't say that," said an older soldier who had been silent until now. "Those who look down on soldiers are in the minority. The vast majority of the people still love and respect the People's Liberation Army. Take last year's incident where four of our soldiers were beaten on a public bus. Many strangers on the bus spoke up for the soldiers, voluntarily providing evidence to the judicial authorities. Local leaders also came to the unit to apologize and express their sympathies, and the perpetrators were punished by law. We shouldn't be upset by the actions of a few individuals."

"Yes, elderly people and women with children on buses prefer to stand near soldiers. The people trust soldiers and look up to us when we serve."

"That's right, to make the people respect us, we must first respect and love ourselves. We should always remember that we are soldiers and strive to maintain the honor of soldiers. Some of our comrades go out in disheveled clothes and behave improperly, which is why people look at us with disdain."

After hearing these discussions, Ji's face slowly showed a smile. He said, "In the dispute with the local youths, I also made mistakes. I was not calm enough in handling the situation, and my methods were too simple and crude. I shouldn't have fought back."

	The Platoon Leader's Heartfelt Words

The reporter asked the platoon leader, He Shuocai, for his views on this incident. He said, "It's wrong to think that being a soldier is humiliating. Complaints are bound to be biased. However, among the soldiers, including some grassroots officers, there are indeed many who lack a sense of honor and pride. We can only strengthen education and guide them correctly. But this is only one aspect of the problem. Whether soldiers have a sense of honor and pride depends not only on the military but also on social factors. The Party and the government, as well as the broad masses of the people, care about and value the military. But there are also some people who lack understanding of the status and role of the military in peacetime and do not know much about the soldiers of the 1980s. Soldiers often say: we don't mind being tired and overworked, but we fear hearing cold words. We talk about the glory of being a soldier, but a single 'stupid soldier' comment can make their hearts cold. Soldiers are all young people; we can't expect them to correctly handle everything just by wearing a military uniform. I sincerely hope that all sectors of society will care about and support the construction of the army."

　　当兵窝囊不窝囊？        
    ——一起军民纠纷引出的话题
    新华社记者  赵苏
    事情发生在京郊一座军营。
    ３月１６日晚６时许，３名地方青年酒后驾驶一辆５５马力的胶轮拖拉机，径直向某坦克团车场大门开来。车场值班员、战士冀春奇拦住问道：“你们干什么？请下车登记”。３青年出口不逊：“你他妈算那一路的？”说着，强行将拖拉机开进车场。小冀怕发生意外，将大门上了锁。３人开车出来时，再次和小冀发生争吵，并对小冀拳脚相加。小冀也用锁门的铁链还了一下。闻声赶来的团政治处副主任周邢平批评小冀不该还手，并责令他向对方道了歉。
    这事在干部战士中引起了议论。
    　　　　战士们的“牢骚话”
    小冀虽然向地方青年道了歉，却一肚子委屈：自己履行职责，无辜挨了打，还挨了领导的批评，实在窝囊！不禁流了泪。
    不少战士同情小冀，也跟着发起“牢骚”：
    “前年咱团有４名战士外出时在公共汽车上被打，现在不出门也挨打，军人的地位越来越低了。”
    “入伍前，我对解放军羡慕极了，想不到当了兵却受窝囊气。”
    “现在当兵的处处被人瞧不起，乘公共汽车，别人生挤愣撞也没人管，军人要是一挤，难听的话来了。不挤吧，就别想按时归队。”
    “军人乘车从来是‘站票’，老人、抱小孩的妇女上了车都愿意往军人旁边站，你好意思坐吗？”
    “咱当兵尽义务，不是图的钱，每月一二十元津贴费，咱也不嫌少。可社会上有些人却嫌当兵的寒酸、土气。咱若是不来当兵，在家做买卖，也能赚大钱。可是人人都想赚钱，谁来保国呢？”
    “唉，我看打起仗来当兵的就吃香了。有句顺口溜说我们打仗时是最可爱的人，救灾时是最可亲的人，没仗没灾时是最多余的人！”
    　　　　战友们的宽心话
    “不能这么说。”一位一直低头不语的老战士说话了：“瞧不起当兵的人毕竟是少数，绝大多数群众还是爱护、尊重解放军的。就说前年我们团４名战士在公共汽车上被打的事吧，好多素不相识的乘客都替战士说话，主动向司法机关出具证明材料，地方领导还亲自到部队来道歉、慰问，凶手也受到法律制裁。我们不必为个别人的言行生气。”
    “对，老人、抱小孩的妇女乘车愿意往军人身边凑，群众遇到危难时愿意求助解放军，这是对军人的信任，是对咱当兵的高看一眼。”
    “有道理，要让人民尊重我们，我们自己首先要自尊自爱。应该时刻想到自己是一名军人，要处处注意维护军人的荣誉。我们有少数同志外出时衣帽不整，言行不检点，这就难怪群众看着不顺眼了。”
    听了这些议论，小冀的脸上慢慢露出了笑容。他说：“在同地方青年发生纠纷时，我也有过错，处理问题态度不够冷静，方法简单生硬，也不该还手。”
    　　　　指导员的心里话
    记者请指导员何树灿谈谈对这件事的看法。他说：“认为当兵‘窝囊’，当然不对，‘牢骚’难免偏颇。不过在战士、包括一些基层干部中，确实有不少人缺乏光荣感，自豪感。我们只能加强教育，正确引导。可是这只是问题的一个方面。军人有无光荣感、自豪感。除了军队因素，还有社会因素。党和政府、广大人民群众对军队是关心的、重视的，但也有一些人对和平时期军队的地位、作用缺乏认识，对八十年代的军人缺乏了解。战士们常说：苦点累点都不怕，就怕听人风凉话。我们讲了半天当兵光荣，一句‘傻大兵’，他的心又冷了半截。战士都是青年人，不能要求他们一穿上军装就什么都能正确对待啊。我恳切地希望社会各方面都来关心、支持部队的建设。”
