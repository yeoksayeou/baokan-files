In Zhengzhou, there stands a monument known as the Erqi Memorial Tower, commemorating the great strike of 1923. The “glorious image” of the “Erqi Tower” has appeared on various media, including magazines, towels, teapots, and bedsheets. For a while, it even served as a symbol of Zhengzhou in the weather forecast segment on Central Television.

The Erqi Square in Zhengzhou should indeed have a tower, as it is the site where the martyrs of the 1923 strike, Wang Shengyou and Si Wende, met their tragic end. As early as 1951, a wooden tower was erected for later generations to pay their respects. The current tower was built in 1971. At that time, the tallest building in Zhengzhou was the seven-story Municipal Committee building. The Erqi Tower, with its 14 stories, was indeed the “general” of Zhengzhou’s architectural landscape until 1978.

However, after 1980, high-rise buildings in Zhengzhou began to sprout like mushrooms after rain. Near the Erqi Tower, there are the 28-story Tianhe Hotel, the 13-story Asia Plaza, the 11-story Shangcheng Building, the 10-story Guoxin Market, and so on. Human aesthetic psychology cannot escape the law of comparison. Mountains are high, the moon is small; greenery is lush, flowers are withered. Thus, the “general” Erqi Tower does not seem so towering but rather appears to be shrinking day by day.

Any architectural art appears and exists within a specific time and space. The French critic Taine once said, “The spiritual climate and the trend of the times always hold the dominant position, selecting the ‘artists,’ and the environment only accepts those that are consistent with it while eliminating the rest.” The design and construction of the Erqi Tower could not escape the imprint of the Cultural Revolution era, where the will of the authorities was paramount and artistic laws were disregarded. The design of the Erqi Tower, with the characters “Erqi” transformed into two towers with seven layers, is a case in point. The dual towers, while seen in the Qiantang Temple in Quanzhou, are typically two separate structures facing each other. The Erqi Tower, however, is named as dual towers but is actually a single connected structure, showing a bit of “creativity.” The number “seven” is straightforwardly represented by seven layers. However, after completion, the tower body looked like a small stool, ruining the aesthetic. Later, it was discovered that the Iron Pagoda in Kaifeng is 13 layers and 54 meters high. Thus, the Erqi Tower was raised to 13 layers and 63 meters, making the “socialist tower” taller than the “feudalist tower,” adding another layer of political color. The artistic conception of the Erqi Tower can be described as forced and contrived. The will of the authorities, political symbolism, and vulgar sociology reached their peak at that time, and the design of the Erqi Tower could not escape this ideological shackle.

The British artist Hogarth believed that the conception of monuments and sculptures, the cone shape is the most appropriate form to embody the unity of simplicity and diversity. He also said, “Towers are generally made in a conical shape,” but to avoid them appearing too simple, people often use a polygonal base instead of a conical one. He further believed that diminution can produce beauty, and the spiral shape of a cone tapering from the bottom to the top towards the center is a beautiful form. This is widely accepted in the art world, but the Erqi Tower, due to its dual connected structure, cannot form a conical shape, lacks the rhythm of diminution, and is almost uniformly thick from top to bottom, a flat rectangular shape, lacking the aesthetic charm of a tower. A beautiful tower looks beautiful from any angle, but the Erqi Tower looks tall from the east and west but appears dull and lifeless from the south and north.

A permanent building should consider future changes in the background. The Erqi Tower is located in the bustling city center. During the Cultural Revolution, people were busy “digging holes deep,” who would have thought that high-rise buildings would appear here one day?

In fact, the Erqi Tower has not changed; it is still as tall as ever. It is just that the background has changed, from being the “solitary crane among chickens” to today’s “chicken among cranes,” making it seem shorter.

### 二七塔的变矮

　　二七塔的变矮
    康群
    郑州有一座二七大罢工纪念塔。“二七塔”的“光辉形象”曾经出现于画报上、毛巾上、茶缸上、床单上。在中央电视台的天气预报节目里，有一阵还作为郑州的象征出现于荧屏。
    郑州二七广场应该有一座塔，因为这里是二七大罢工烈士汪胜友、司文德殉难之地，早在１９５１年就造了一座木塔，供后人凭吊。现在这座是１９７１年建的。当时郑州最高的建筑是市委七层大楼。而二七塔有１４层高，确是１９７８年以前郑州市建筑群里的“将军”了。
    但是，１９８０年以后，郑州高层建筑如雨后春笋，日见其多。二七塔附近，就有２８层的天河宾馆，１３层的亚细亚商场，１１层的商城大厦，１０层的国信商场等等。人的审美心理逃脱不了对比的规律，山高月小，绿肥红瘦，于是觉得二七塔这位“将军”并不那么高大，反而日益变矮了。
    任何建筑艺术都是在一定的时间、空间里出现和存在的。法国的丹纳说过，精神的气候、时代的趋向始终占着统治的地位，选择着“艺术家”，环境只接受同它一致的品种而淘汰其余的品种。二七塔设计建造时，怎能不留下“文革”时期唯长官意志是从、无视艺术规律的印记。二七塔的设计，以“二七”两字衍化为双塔七层。双塔，在泉州开元寺有过，那是东西对峙各一座，而二七塔，名为双塔，实是连体一座，倒有点“创造性”。“七”则盖成七层，那更是毫无疑义了。不料盖好后，塔身像个小板凳，大煞风景。而后查得开封铁塔高１３层５４米，所以二七塔加高到１３层６３米，“社会主义塔”高于“封建主义塔”，岂不又争得一层政治油彩，二七塔的艺术构思可谓牵强附会。长官意志、政治图解、庸俗社会学在那时发展到登峰造极的地步，二七塔设计怎能挣脱这思想桎梏呢？
    英国艺术家荷加斯认为，纪念碑和雕塑的构思，圆锥体是体现单纯和多样的统一最适当的形式。他又说，“塔，一般都按圆锥形做的”，但为了使它们不显得过于简单，人们往往不用圆锥形的基础，而代之以多角形。他又认为，递减可以产生美，圆锥形由下而上向中心逐渐缩小的螺旋形，都是美的形体。这是艺术界公认的，而二七塔由于双塔连体，不可能成圆锥形，缺乏递减的律动，几乎上下一般粗，扁长方形，缺乏塔的美感情致。一座美丽的塔从任何角度看都是美的，而二七塔从东西看倒还峭拔，从南北看就呆板，没有灵气。
    一座永久的建筑应该考虑到未来变化的背景。二七塔建于闹市，“文革”时忙于“深挖洞”，谁会想到这里将出现高耸入云的高层建筑呢？
    其实，二七塔没有变，还是那么高，只是由于背景变了，从过去的“鹤立鸡群”到今天的“鸡立鹤群”，所以觉得它变矮了。
