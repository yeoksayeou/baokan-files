Title: The Hope for Popular Literature

An editor of a popular literature magazine, whose publication is relatively successful, wrote in a letter expressing his weariness of a life "focused solely on 'circulation' and 'profit'" and his desire to escape this "environment where the righteous cannot suppress the evil."

The widespread dissemination of popular literature magazines, along with the flourishing of popular literature creation, is a recent phenomenon. According to statistics, there are approximately 190 such magazines, many of which have circulations reaching hundreds of thousands of copies. This reflects the increasing recognition of literature's spiritual entertainment value and is also a result of literature being inevitably drawn into the vortex of commodity supply and demand relationships and value laws under the influence of a market economy. Many enthusiasts of this work, upon discovering that the literary entertainment function, long suppressed, can attract so many spiritually hungry readers once released, were deeply inspired. They wanted to make a mark in this literary style and explore a path for Chinese popular literature; they also had aspirations to provide readers with a high and healthy spiritual entertainment, so that readers could enjoy art while their souls were nourished. However, the strong commercial nature of popular literature magazines makes them, once they enter the market whirlwind, like an untamed horse. The more these publications descend into lowbrow content, the more popular they become, turning into a quick way to make money. Due to the influence of money and the rise of vulgar thoughts, works that promote pornography, violence, and the bizarre have flooded the market, overwhelming the good with the bad in an unstoppable wave. This has left those truly committed to forging a new path for popular literature in great confusion. They often bear the heavy burden of "sustaining the magazine with the magazine," "sustaining the magazine with books," or sustaining some organization or association. How can they make money? Some people are unwilling to be in this awkward situation and thus want to leave the "environment where the righteous cannot suppress the evil." This sentiment is understandable, but it is somewhat pessimistic.

Recently, the four popular literature magazines, *Jingu Chuanqi*, *Zhongguo Gu Shi*, *Zhonghua Chuanqi*, and *Qiangu Fengliu*, issued a five-point proposal to fellow editors of literary magazines nationwide. This proposal is a call to challenge the negative trends in popular literature magazines. It states: "Editors of popular literature magazines should 'cherish, respect, love, and strengthen themselves'; they should aim to publish 'literary works that are beneficial to cultivating morality' as their editorial goal; they should resolutely eliminate 'works that harm the physical and mental health of young people'; and in maintaining the unique style of their own magazines, they should strive to produce new works of socialist popular literature that are rooted in China and face the world."

The four magazines that issued the proposal may not have been without mistakes in their own publishing practices, but they are aware of their responsibilities and missions and are willing to share this with their peers, which is commendable and gives us hope for popular literature magazines.

The activity of popular literature and popular literature magazines is a recent phenomenon, but due to some deviations, their reputation has been damaged, and there is widespread criticism in society. Popular literature magazines have broken through the "leftist" constraints and followed the tide of reform. Now, they face a new choice: if they allow the vulgar thoughts that arise with the impact of the market economy to spread, this late-blooming flower will wither in disgrace and lose its vitality. For those who truly care about popular literature, they should take action and guide the healthy development of popular literature, just as proposed by *Jingu Chuanqi* and the other four magazines.

### 通俗文学的希望所在

　　通俗文学的希望所在
    张伯海
    一位通俗文学期刊的编辑，他们刊物办得还算红火，但在来信中却颇带歉疚地说：自己厌倦了“两眼盯着‘印数’和‘利润’的生活”，渴望摆脱这“正不压邪的环境”。
    通俗文学期刊随着通俗文学创作的活跃，而在社会上广泛传播，是近几年的事。据统计，现有通俗文学期刊约１９０种，其中不少发行量达数十万册。这是文学所具有的精神娱悦作用日益受人重视的表现；也是在商品经济形势下，文学难以避免地卷入商品供求关系和价值法则的漩涡中的结果。不少热心于这一工作的同志，当他们发现长期被禁锢的文学娱悦功能，一旦释放出来，能获得如此众多、精神饥渴的读者时，曾经深受鼓舞。他们很想在这一文学样式上施展一番，为中国通俗文学探出一条路来；他们也曾有所追求，希望带给读者的精神娱悦是高尚的、健康的，使读者在获得艺术享受时，心灵也能蒙上雨露。但是，通俗文学期刊的强烈商品属性，却使它一旦卷入市场漩涡后，便像只难以驾驭的野马。这类刊物越往格调低下里办，越走俏，成为捞钱的一条捷径。由于金钱的鬼使神差，也由于市侩思想乘机泛起，宣扬色情、凶杀、怪诞的粗制滥造的作品，像决了口似地冒出来，一时之间，以劣胜优汰、令人难以阻拒的声势冲进市场。这使得真正有志于为通俗文学开一条新路的人陷于极大的困惑之中。他们身上大都背着“以刊养刊”、“以刊养书”或以刊养什么团体、协会之类的沉重包袱，不赚钱怎么行？有的人不情愿陷在这种尴尬的境地里，因此想离开“正不压邪的环境”，这想法虽令人同情，但未免消沉。
    最近，《今古传奇》、《中国故事》、《中华传奇》、《千古风流》四家通俗文学刊物，向全国文艺期刊编辑同行们发出的五条倡议，却使我们听到了另一种声音。这是向通俗文学期刊中的恶劣倾向挑战的空谷足音。其中提到：通俗文学期刊编辑者要“自珍、自尊、自爱、自强”；要把发表“有利于陶冶情操的优秀文学作品，作为编刊追求的目标”；坚决剔除“毒害青少年身心健康的描绘”；“在保持各自刊物风采中，力求推出既立足本国又面向世界的具有中国特色的社会主义通俗文学新作来。”
    提出倡议的四家刊物，在自己的办刊实践中，未必没有过差误，但他们意识到自己的责任和使命，并愿以此与同行们共勉，令人钦敬，使人看到了通俗文学期刊的希望所在。
    通俗文学及通俗文艺期刊的活跃，虽是近几年的事，但由于一定程度偏离方向，已使声誉受损，社会上一片责备声。通俗文学期刊曾经冲破“左”的禁锢，顺应了改革的大潮，现在，又面临着新的抉择：如果听任随着商品经济冲击而泛起的庸俗思想泛滥，这个迟开的花朵将在玷辱下枯萎，葬送自己的生命力。对此，真正爱护通俗文学的人，都应身体力行，引导通俗文学健康发展，就像《今古传奇》等四家刊物所倡议的这样。
