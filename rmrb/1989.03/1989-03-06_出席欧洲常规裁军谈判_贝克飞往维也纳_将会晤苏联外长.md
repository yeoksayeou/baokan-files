	Attending the European Conventional Arms Negotiations,
	Baker Flies to Vienna
	To Meet with Soviet Foreign Minister

	Our Washington correspondent Zhang Qixun reports: U.S. Secretary of State Baker departed Washington this evening for Vienna to attend the opening ceremony of the European Conventional Arms Negotiations scheduled for March 6. According to reports from here, both Secretary of State Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze will deliver speeches at the opening ceremony and will hold a private meeting on March 7 to exchange views on various issues.

	The European Conventional Arms Negotiations are new arms reduction talks between NATO and Warsaw Pact countries, differing from the previous 15-year-long Central European Arms Negotiations that ended without progress. Some American analysts believe that the situation this time is different, as Soviet leader Gorbachev announced last December a unilateral reduction of 500,000 troops, including a decrease in their military forces in Europe. Both the East and the West have expressed that now is the "best time" to reduce conventional forces in Europe. It is reported that NATO's negotiating representatives held a meeting in Brussels on March 4 to prepare NATO's initial arms reduction proposals.

　　出席欧洲常规裁军谈判
    贝克飞往维也纳
    将会晤苏联外长
    本报华盛顿３月４日电  记者张启昕报道：美国国务卿贝克今天晚上飞离华盛顿前往维也纳出席将于６日在那里举行的欧洲裁减常规力量谈判开幕式。据此间消息，贝克国务卿和苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽都将在开幕式上发表讲话，并将于７日举行私下会晤，就多方面问题交换意见。
    欧洲裁减常规力量谈判是北约和华约国家之间举行的新的裁军谈判，不同于历时１５年而以未取得进展而告结束的中欧裁军谈判。美国的一些分析家认为，这次谈判情况不同，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫去年１２月已宣布单方面裁军５０万，其中包括减少它在欧洲的军事力量。东西方都表示，现在是裁减欧洲常规力量的“最好时机”。据报道，北约的谈判代表已于４日在布鲁塞尔举行了会议，准备提出北约的初步裁军建议。
