Title: Topics That Should Not Be Discussed

This is a topic that should not have been discussed, but the delegates from Shandong still brought it up at the small group meeting to discuss national policies. It was a unique and lively discussion.

The topic arose from an ordinary case. In 1986, a worker from Qingdao, Cao Junzheng, had a dispute with his neighbor Chen over building a house, leading to long-standing grudges. One day, Chen gathered six young men from the neighborhood, armed with knives, and stabbed Cao, leaving him with a disabled right leg and unable to work to this day.

After the assailants were detained by the police station, the Cao family began to wait for justice. Unexpectedly, what they received was a surprising decision from the Public Security Bureau: it was a civil dispute, and the assailants should just pay economic compensation.

The Cao family was puzzled: this was clearly a criminal case, why did the Public Security Bureau insist on treating it as a civil case? Unable to find justice in the Public Security Bureau, the Cao family turned to the municipal government, the municipal political and legal committee, the municipal people's congress, the provincial public security department, the provincial people's congress, and even the Ministry of Public Security, making 160 visits over two years. They went to every possible department. According to the work procedures, these departments forwarded the Cao family's complaint back to the Public Security Bureau, which then sent a reply to the handling departments stating that "Cao does not accept the handling opinion, goes everywhere to petition, and everywhere to sue, disrupting government work." Thus, what started as a dispute between the Cao family and Chen turned into a dispute between the Cao family and the Public Security Bureau. When the Cao family went to the court to sue, the court was in a difficult position: the public security department had already issued a handling opinion, and the court was not appropriate to accept the case.

This brought up the first issue for the people's representatives to discuss: what should the people do when the law enforcement agencies fail to enforce the law strictly? Some representatives spoke up: the Administrative Litigation Law (draft) solves exactly this kind of problem. Other representatives were concerned: in places where officials protect each other, suing the government is not easy. Having laws to rely on is indeed good, but enforcing the law and maintaining the seriousness of the law is more important and more meaningful in reality.

The deeper issue lies ahead. When the Cao family's pleas fell on deaf ears, they thought of the people's representatives. Conveying the people's will is a duty that people's representatives cannot shirk. Moreover, questioning the public security department is also a right of the people's representatives. The representatives thought.

In September of last year, Representative He Xuesheng wrote to the municipal people's congress, but it was like a stone sinking into the sea. In November, 12 people's representatives jointly proposed a request, but it was still like a stone sinking into the sea. Afterwards, the municipal people's congress repeatedly demanded that the public security bureau answer the people's representatives' questions, but it was still like a stone sinking into the sea.

In January of this year, the Qingdao representatives attending the Seventh National People's Congress Second Session revisited the issue during their work inspection, and the municipal public security bureau finally gave a response that did not satisfy the people's representatives. The case remained the same, but what started as a dispute between the Cao family and the Public Security Bureau had escalated into a dispute between the people's representatives and the public security bureau.

This brought up the second issue for the people's representatives to discuss: the constitution stipulates that the people's congress is the highest organ of state power and has the power to supervise the government, but in actual cases, it is difficult and helpless.

Xin Xianling representative said that last year, we Qingdao municipal people's representatives were determined to do this for the voters, but we ultimately failed. On the scale of justice, the power of 12 people's representatives is not enough to outweigh the power of a public security bureau chief.

He Xuesheng representative said that actually, the case is not complicated, and the facts are very clear. What is complicated is the interpersonal relationships. What we are worried about is that the authority of the people's representatives is being disregarded. In fact, they don't take the people's representatives seriously at all.

Ou Yang Guanghua representative said: the case itself is indisputable. But the case gradually escalating and bringing up many issues outside the case is thought-provoking. The Cao family came to us out of trust in the representatives, but if we can't even handle such a small case, how can we go back and explain to the voters? Will the voters still trust the people's representatives?

When talking about this case, the representatives in this small group were all familiar with it. Some representatives sighed, some representatives were indignant. The original topic for the morning was to discuss the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law, but the hot topic for the representatives was always the Cao family's case. Before the discussion ended, some representatives said that we should not get bogged down in this specific case. Some representatives disagreed: discussing theory in relation to practice is vivid and vivid. But more representatives expressed that this matter, though small, contains deep and serious real-life significance. The ordinary case of the Cao family raises extraordinary questions.

### 不该讨论的议题

　　不该讨论的议题
    本报记者  何伟
    这是一项本不该讨论的议题，但是，山东团的人大代表还是把它带上了讨论国家大政方针的小组会，别开生面，议论风生。
    议题由一起普通案件引起。１９８６年，青岛工人曹俊正因盖房与邻居陈某产生嫌隙，两家结下宿怨。一日，陈某纠集社会青年６人，操刀刺伤曹俊正，使他右腿致残，迄今不能上班。
    凶手被派出所拘留后，曹家就开始等待法律的公正制裁。不料，曹家盼到的，却是公安分局一份出人意料的处理意见：这是一起民事纠纷，罚凶手经济赔偿就算了。
    曹家不解：明明白白的一起刑事案件，公安分局为何硬断成民事案件？曹家在公安局找不到公正，只好去市政府、市政法委、市人大、省公安厅、省人大以至公安部，费时两年，上访累计１６０余次。能去的部门都去了。按照工作程序，这些部门把曹家的诉状转回了公安分局，公安分局照例将一份“曹不接受处理意见，到处上访，到处告状，干扰政府工作”的答复送给催办部门。于是，原来曹家与陈某的官司，演变成曹家与公安分局的官司。曹家去法院告状，法院为难：公安部门已有处理意见，法院不宜受理。
    这引出了人大代表议论的问题之一：执法部门有法不依、执法不严，老百姓怎么办？有的代表发言：《行政诉讼法》（草案）解决的正是这类问题。有的代表担忧：在官官相护的地方，民告官并不易。有法可依诚然可喜，但依法办案、维护法律的严肃性更重要，更具现实意义。
    发人深思的还在后面。当曹家呼天喊地不应时，想到了人大代表。转达民意是人大代表义不容辞的职责。而且，向公安部门质询，也是人大代表的权利。人大代表心想。
    去年９月，代表贺学圣上书市人大，如石沉大海。１１月，１２名人大代表联名提出要求，仍是石沉大海。此后，市人大屡次三番要求公安局回答人大代表的提问，还是石沉大海。
    今年１月，赴京参加人大七届二次大会的青岛代表视察工作，旧帐重提，市公安局才作了令人大代表不能满意的答复。案情依旧，只是一起曹家与公安分局的官司，演成人大代表与公安局的案件。
    这引出了人大代表议论的问题之二：宪法规定，人大是国家最高权力机关，具有监督政府的职权，但遇到实际案例，却步履艰难，无计可施。
    辛显令代表说，去年，我们青岛市的人大代表决心为选民办好这件事，最终也没成功。在正义的天平上，１２个人大代表的权力，抵不过一个公安分局的局长。
    贺学圣代表说，其实案情并不复杂，事实也很清楚，复杂的是人际关系。而我们忧心的是，人大代表的权威性受到轻视。实际上，人家根本没把人大代表放在眼里。
    欧阳光华代表说：案件本身无可争议。倒是案件逐步升级，引出案件以外的许多问题令人深思。曹家来找我们，是出于对代表的信任，可我们连这么小的案件都无能为力，如何回去向选民交待，选民还会信任人大代表吗？
    谈起此案，这个小组的代表大都熟悉。有的代表长叹，有的代表愤慨。上午原定的议题是讨论行政诉讼法草案，可代表的热门话题始终离不开曹家案例。讨论结束前个别代表说，我们不该在这具体的案件上纠缠。有的代表不同意：理论联系实际的讨论，生动，形象。而更多的代表则表示，这件事看起来不大，却蕴藏着深沉而凝重的现实意义。曹家的普通案例，提出了不寻常的问题。
