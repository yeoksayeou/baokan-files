On February 2, the 418th passenger train was delayed at the Henan Xixian railway station. The door of car number 5 did not open for a long time, causing passengers who were preparing to get off to become anxious and frustrated. Some passengers, carrying their luggage, searched everywhere for the train attendant. After the train stopped for two or three minutes, an attendant finally came from another car to open the door. When the train arrived at Gaocun Bridge station, the doors of several cars remained unopened. A few minutes later, the attendants of cars 3, 4, and 5 emerged from the duty room of car 4, each holding a deck of playing cards. It turned out they had been playing poker in the duty room. Just as the train was about to depart, they opened the car doors. A deputy section chief from the Anyang Railway Section saw this and went to report it to the train conductor, but he couldn't find him anywhere.

　　玩牌耽误开车门
    ２月２日，４１８次旅客列车行至河南淇县火车站时，５号车厢迟迟不开门，准备下车的旅客急得团团转，有的肩扛行李到处找列车员。车停了两三分钟，一名列车员才从另一节车厢过来开门。列车到高村桥站后，几节车厢的门都无人开。过了几分钟，３号、４号、５号车厢的列车员才从４号车厢的乘务室出来，每人手中握着一把扑克牌。原来他们在乘务室玩扑克牌。列车快开了，他们才将车厢门打开。安阳车务段的一名副段长见状后去找列车长反映，可到处也找不着。
