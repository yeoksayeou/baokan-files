Another Spring

	By Ling Zhijun, People's Daily reporter

	Beijing, another spring. As China faces many contradictions, many issues, and many complex emotions, the March winds have opened the curtains of the "Two Sessions," bringing joy and anticipation to the deputies and members.

	After all, the overheated economy is cooling down, inflation is easing, and the people are once again depositing money in banks. Both the public and officials are pointing out corruption... “The speed of reform and rectification is not fast enough, but the tense atmosphere of last summer and autumn has indeed eased,” said Hebei delegate Tian Futing.

	There is a mix of tension and calm; a mix of disappointment and expectation.

	From last spring to this spring, people have experienced unprecedented fluctuations. Initially, there was anticipation for a breakthrough in reform, followed by being thrown into a "panic buying" frenzy by the sudden changes in the situation. The repeated "storming" and the return of "monopolies," the market's dilemma, the relentless price increases, the speculation by officials and the hardships of migrant workers, the "business boom" and the "wave of going abroad"... “Achievements are the main thing, difficulties are temporary,” saying this simply cannot dispel the nation's doubts. Complaints, questions, and folk songs are circulating in society...

	Advancing reform, revitalizing China, has the nation really lost its enthusiasm? No! The facts have drawn the opposite conclusion. In the winter that has just passed, discussions about the situation were exceptionally lively. Some calmly reflected on the path of reform, some urgently called for the soul of the Chinese nation's belief; some advocated strengthening the nation's crisis awareness; some looked forward to the acceleration of the democratic process; some proposed "new authoritarianism," followed by a heated debate... In many different understandings, including some complaints, there is precisely a common point: reform cannot stop, stopping is the most frightening mistake.

	A newspaper with influence published a consensus of a group of young scholars as a headline:

	“Unite the strength of the entire nation to solve the most difficult problems.”

	China's top leadership is also thinking about the same problem, that is, how to mobilize the people to invigorate their spirits, pool their wisdom, and find a way to overcome difficulties. From January to March, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have solicited opinions from various sectors in a broad range of fields and made a series of decisions: building a clean government, strictly governing the party, industrial policy guidelines, opinions on prospering literature and art...

	“We must have confidence, but this is not the 'anesthesia' of being complacent in danger, but seeing the problems and seeking solutions,” said an old comrade in a Zhongshan suit who participated in the NPC. Yes. This is an extraordinary spring. At this moment, the nearly 3,000 people's representatives and more than 2,000 CPPCC members gathered in the Great Hall of the People will surely not let down this spring.

### 又一个春天

　　又一个春天
    本报记者  凌志军
    北京，又一个春天。当中国面临着许多矛盾、许多事务和许多复杂的情绪，３月风吹开了“两会”的帷幕，也为代表、委员们带来了喜悦与盼望。　　
    毕竟过热的经济在降温，通货膨胀趋缓，老百姓重新把钱送进银行，民举官究齐指腐败现象……“治理整顿见效的速度还不够快，但去年夏秋的紧张心理确实缓和了，”河北代表田福庭说。
    几分紧张，几分平静；几分失望，几分期待，交织一起。
    从上一个春天到这一个春天，人们经历了少有的起伏。始而期待着改革新的一举突破，继之被形势的突变抛进“抢购”风潮。来而复去的“闯关”，去而复来的“专营”，进退维谷的市场，压而难止的涨价，“官倒”投机与民工困顿，“经商热”与“出国潮”……“成绩是主要的，困难是暂时的”，简单地这么说说，已不能消除国民的疑惑。牢骚、质问、顺口溜，在社会上流传……
    推进改革，振兴中华，难道国民真的失去了热情？不！事实作出了相反的结论。在刚刚过去的那个冬天，各种对于时局的议论异常热烈。有人冷静反思改革的道路，有人急切呼唤中华民族信念之魂；有人呼吁强化国民的危机意识；有人期盼着民主进程的加快；有人提出了“新权威主义”，紧跟着一番激烈的论争……在许多不同的认识包括一些牢骚中，恰恰贯穿着一个共同的基点：改革不能停顿，停顿是最可怕的失误。
    一家有影响的报纸把一群青年学者的共识作为头条标题：
    “凝聚全民族的力量解决最棘手的问题”。
    中国的最高领导层，也在思考着同样的问题，那就是如何动员全民振奋精神，群策群力，找到排除困难的出路。从１月到３月，党中央和国务院在广泛的领域里征询各界意见，作出一系列的决策：廉政建设、从严治党、产业政策要点、繁荣文艺意见……
    “我们必须有信心，但这不是居危思安的‘麻醉’，而是看到问题，寻求对策”，参加人代会一位身着中山装的老同志这样说。是的。这是一个不平凡的春天。此时此刻，汇集在人民大会堂里的近３０００名人民代表和２０００多名政协委员无疑是不会辜负这个春天的。
