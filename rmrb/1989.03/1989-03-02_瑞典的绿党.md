The Green Party of Sweden, also known as the Environmental Party, was founded in 1981. Although the party has only 7,500 members, it garnered 300,000 votes in the last general election, securing 20 seats and becoming a significant political force in Sweden.

The rise of the Green Party in Sweden has deep roots. After World War II, scientific and technological advancements in Western capitalist countries led to rapid economic growth and significant improvements in people's material lives. However, the rapid development of industry also brought environmental pollution and ecological imbalances. In the past decade, several major accidents have occurred in factories along the rivers in Western Europe, releasing large amounts of toxic substances into the rivers, seriously threatening the production and living conditions of residents on both banks. Forests have been decimated by acid rain, and many rivers have become acidic. Industrial waste and household garbage have increased exponentially, with Sweden producing 500 kilograms of garbage per person per year, the highest in Northern Europe. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant explosion in the Soviet Union also resulted in nuclear fallout in Sweden. The spread of toxic algae in the Baltic Sea has led to the mass death of seals. All these issues have raised concerns among the people. As the threat of war to human survival decreases and the threat of environmental pollution increases, the establishment of the Green Party and its advocacy for environmental protection reflect people's concerns for the future.

The Green Party in Sweden has no central leadership or central leaders. Instead, it has male and female spokespeople who are regularly rotated.

The Green Party claims to "not be affiliated with any group." Its primary task in parliament is to launch a comprehensive offensive against the current environmental degradation. It has proposed a series of measures aimed at reducing pollution and conserving energy, such as advocating for the "abolition of nuclear power plants within three years," "the use of clean and energy-efficient public transportation," "banning vehicles in city centers," "imposing environmental taxes on fertilizers and pesticides," and "strict regulations on toxic residues and additives in food." On the other hand, overemphasizing environmental protection will increase production costs and affect Sweden's international competitiveness, thereby conflicting with the high-level consumption of the Swedish people. Therefore, implementing the aforementioned proposals is very difficult. Overall, many people in Sweden still hold a cautious attitude towards the Green Party.

    瑞典的绿党 
    江明义
    瑞典的绿党又叫环境党，诞生于1981年。该党成员虽只有7500人，但在去年大选中却获得30万张选票，赢得20个议席，成了瑞典一支重要政治力量。
    瑞典绿党的崛起有其深刻背景。战后，西方资本主义国家的科学技术和生产力发展迅速，人们的物质生活有了很大提高。但是，工业的迅速发展又带来了环境的污染、生态平衡的破坏。近10年来，西欧一些河流沿岸的工厂发生几起重大事故，大量剧毒物质流入河内，严重威胁了两岸居民的生产和生活。森林也由于酸雨的侵蚀而大片死亡，许多河流被酸化。工业废料和生活垃圾成倍增长，瑞典每年人均生产垃圾500公斤，为西北欧各国之冠。1986年，苏联切尔诺贝利核电站爆炸，瑞典也遭到核尘污染。波罗的海毒藻蔓延滋长，海豹大量死亡……这一切都引起人们的忧虑。当战争对人类生存的威胁下降、环境污染的威胁增大时，绿党的成立和对环境保护的呼吁反映了人们对未来的关注。
    瑞典绿党在组织上既无中央领导机构，也没有中央领导人，只有经常轮换的男女发言人各1名。
    绿党宣称“不依附于任何集团”，它在议会的首要任务是对现在环境的破坏全面出击。它提出了一系列旨在减少污染、节约能源的主张。如争取“3年内取消核电站”，“使用清洁而节能的公共交通工具”，“市中心禁止路面行车”，“对化肥、农药增收环境税”，“对食物中有毒的残余物质和添加剂作出严格规定”，等等。另一方面，过分强调环境保护又会增加生产成本，影响到瑞典产品在国际上的竞争能力，从而同瑞典人的高层次消费发生矛盾，所以要实现前述主张是很难的。总的看来，瑞典许多人对绿党还是持一种观望态度。
