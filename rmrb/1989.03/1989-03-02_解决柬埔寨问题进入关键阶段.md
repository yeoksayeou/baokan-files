The Cambodian war, which has affected the overall situation in Southeast Asia and threatened world peace, has been ongoing for over a decade. As regional hotspots generally cool down and move towards political solutions, the political resolution of the Cambodian issue has entered a critical period: negotiations have touched on substantive issues, offering hope for a solution while also facing stubborn resistance, making the struggle intense.

The Cambodian war is a result of Vietnam's attempt to annex a small neighboring country by force, with the Cambodian people forced to take up arms to defend themselves—a war of aggression and counter-aggression. Originally, Vietnam did not want a political solution, aiming to eliminate the anti-Vietnamese patriotic forces through military means. Only after facing the stubborn resistance of the Cambodian patriotic armed forces and a stalemate on the battlefield did Vietnam change its strategy and agree to a political solution. However, it only sees political resolution as a means to maintain its military and political control over Cambodia.

In contrast, the three anti-Vietnamese factions in Cambodia, since the formation of their united government, have consistently advocated for a political solution. Their "Eight-Point Proposal" in June 1986 was the first and best plan for a political resolution to the Cambodian issue. Prince Sihanouk's five-point plan from last year is an even more practical and programmatic document. Under the impetus of international détente and the promotion by ASEAN, the first informal meeting on the Cambodian issue was held in Jakarta in July last year. Subsequently, the four Cambodian factions engaged in various forms of bilateral or trilateral contacts, but without results. However, this marks the entry of the political resolution of the Cambodian issue into a critical stage. Its characteristics are:

The parties involved have moved from discussing procedural and general issues to engaging in substantive debates. No one dares to oppose the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. The debate is over when the withdrawal will be complete, whether it should be a genuine, internationally supervised, unconditional withdrawal, and whether the United Nations should participate in mediation and supervision. After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, should a Cambodian interim government be established, and if so, how?

The number of countries participating in the political resolution process is increasing, and meetings are becoming more frequent. In addition to the four Cambodian factions, foreign ministers from China and the Soviet Union, Thailand and Vietnam, and China and Thailand have held talks, and the deputy foreign ministers of China and Vietnam have held their first internal consultations. The second Jakarta meeting on the Cambodian issue concluded on February 21.

There are some converging views among the relevant countries on international aspects of the political resolution of the Cambodian issue, but differences remain. The three factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea have strengthened their unity, with the prince announcing last month the resumption of his chairmanship of the Coalition Government. The united government spoke with one voice at the second Jakarta meeting, issuing a powerful call for justice. However, Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime have maintained their stubborn positions, ultimately leading to the meeting's failure to achieve results.

Currently, the obstacles to the political resolution of the Cambodian issue come from Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime, which takes orders from it. The Soviet Union has a responsibility to urge Vietnam to abandon its regional hegemonic ambitions. Vietnam's current policy is to try to extricate itself from the Cambodian war while attempting to bring Cambodia under its sphere of influence for long-term control. Therefore, on substantive issues, Vietnam continues to play tricks.

On the one hand, it propagates a "timeline" for withdrawing troops by the end of this September, but on the other hand, it proposes numerous preconditions, stating that if these conditions are not met, the "timeline" can be changed at any time. It appears flexible but does not genuinely intend to withdraw.

It advocates separating the international and domestic aspects of solving the Cambodian issue, opposing the correct proposal for a comprehensive solution. Everyone knows that both the international and domestic aspects of the Cambodian issue were created by Vietnam. It invaded Cambodia with a large military force, disrupting peace and stability in Southeast Asia, forming the international aspect of the problem; it supported the Heng Samrin regime in Cambodia and suppressed resistance forces, constituting the domestic aspect. Now, it pretends to be an outsider, wanting to sit on an equal footing with other relevant countries to discuss the international aspect of the problem. This is purely to shirk its responsibility for aggression and does not want to comprehensively resolve the Cambodian issue.

From the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops to the holding of free elections in Cambodia, there is a transitional period. During this period, it is reasonable to simultaneously dissolve the Phnom Penh regime and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, and establish a four-party interim united government led by Prince Sihanouk. However, Vietnam and Phnom Penh both reject this, attempting to maintain the status quo and have the Heng Samrin regime oversee the elections, continuing to control Cambodia.

It opposes the United Nations participating in mediation, supervision, and the dispatch of international peacekeeping forces. Its opposition to the proposal for an international conference is also an attempt to exclude the United Nations and find another channel. It continues to play tricks and confront the international community.

Now, the key to the political resolution of the Cambodian issue lies with Vietnam. History is sounding the alarm for it: Aggressor, wake up! What is irreversible is not the permanent occupation of Cambodia by Vietnam, but the political resolution that aligns with the global trends of peace and development!

    解决柬埔寨问题进入关键阶段
    杨木
    牵动东南亚大局、危及世界和平的柬埔寨战争已进行10年多了。在地区战争“热点”普遍降温并走上政治解决道路的大潮推动下，柬埔寨问题的政治解决已进入关键时期：谈判已接触到实质性问题，有解决的希望又有顽固的阻力，斗争十分激烈。
    柬埔寨战争是越南企图以武力吞并一个弱小邻国、柬埔寨人民被迫拿起武器救亡的一场侵略与反侵略的战争。本来，越南妄想用军事手段消灭抗越爱国武装，是不想政治解决的。只是在遭到柬埔寨爱国武装力量的顽强抵抗、战场形成僵持局面之后，越南才被迫改变策略，同意政治解决。但是，它只是把政治解决当作维护其在柬军事、政治控制的一种手段。反观柬埔寨抗越三方，它们自成立联合政府后，一直高举政治解决的旗帜。它1986年6月提出的《八点建议》，是政治解决柬埔寨问题的第一个最佳方案。西哈努克亲王去年提出的五点计划，更是一个切实可行的纲领性文件。在国际缓和大趋势推动及东盟促进下，去年7月在雅加达召开了关于柬埔寨问题的第一次非正式会议。随后，柬埔寨四方又进行了多种形式的两边或三边的接触，但均无成果。不过，这标志着政治解决柬埔寨问题已进入关键阶段。其特征是：
    有关各方已从程序性、一般性问题的讨论进入实质性问题的交锋。越南必须从柬埔寨撤军已无人敢反对，争论的问题是：什么时候全部撤军？要不要实行真正的、有国际监督的、无先决条件的撤军？要不要联合国参加调停和监督？越军撤走后，要不要成立和怎样组成一个柬埔寨临时政府？
    参加政治解决进程的国家日益广泛，会晤频繁。除柬埔寨四方外，中苏、泰越、中泰外长已举行会谈，中越副外长也举行了第一次内部磋商。第二次关于柬埔寨问题的雅加达会议于2月21日结束。
    有关各国在政治解决柬埔寨问题国际等方面的若干意见，已有所接近，但分歧尚存。民柬联合政府三方加强了团结，亲王于上个月宣布恢复他的民柬主席职务。联合政府在第二次雅加达会议上协调一致，发出了强有力的正义之声。而越南和金边政权却坚持顽固立场，终使会议未取得成果。
    当前，政治解决柬埔寨问题的阻力来自越南及听命于它的金边政权。苏联有责任去促使越南放弃其地区霸权主义的图谋。越南当前的总方针是：既要从柬埔寨战争中脱身，又妄图把柬埔寨纳入自己的势力范围，以长期控制。因此，在实质问题上，越南依然在玩弄花招。
    它一方面宣传今年9月底撤军的“时间表”，另一方面又提出诸多先决条件，声称如不答应这些条件，“时间表”可随时变更。它表面灵活，实际上则不想真正撤军。
    它侈谈分开国际和国内两个方面去解决柬埔寨问题，反对一揽子解决的正确主张。大家知道，柬埔寨问题的国际和国内方面，都是越南一手造成的。它派兵大举入侵柬埔寨，破坏东南亚和平与稳定，形成问题的国际方面；它在柬埔寨国内扶植韩桑林政权，围剿抵抗力量，构成国内方面。现在，它伪装局外人，想与其他有关国家平起平坐，讨论问题的国际方面，这完全是为了推卸侵略责任，不想全面解决柬埔寨问题。
    越南撤军至柬埔寨实行自由选举有一个过渡时期。这个时期，理应同时解散金边政权及民柬联合政府，成立以西哈努克为首的四方临时联合政府；但越南和金边对此都予以否定，妄想保持现状，由韩桑林政权来主持大选，继续控制柬埔寨。
    反对联合国参加调停、监督并派遣国际和平部队。它反对关于召开国际会议的主张，也是想排斥联合国的参与而另辟渠道。它继续玩弄手段，与国际社会相对抗。
    现在，政治解决柬埔寨问题的关键是越南。历史在向它敲警钟了：侵略者，醒来！“不可逆转”的不是越南占领柬埔寨的永久化，而是符合和平、发展世界潮流的政治解决！
