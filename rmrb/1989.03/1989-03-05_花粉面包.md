A friend who recently returned from Japan brought me a bag of bread. Just holding it, I could smell the aroma of freshly baked bread; it was incredibly soft to the touch.

My friend told me that this pollen bread is rich in protein, free amino acids, various vitamins, minerals, and easily absorbable sugars. It is said that long-term consumption of this bread is effective in preventing high blood pressure, cerebral hemorrhage, heart failure, and other cardiovascular diseases.

　　花粉面包
    一位刚从日本回来的老友给我带来一袋面包，拿在手上就有股烤面包香味；捏一下，极柔软。
    友人告诉我，这种花粉面包有极丰富的蛋白质、游离氨基酸、多种维生素、矿物质、易于吸收的糖类等。据说长期食用对预防高血压、脑溢血、心力衰弱等心血管疾病颇有功效。
