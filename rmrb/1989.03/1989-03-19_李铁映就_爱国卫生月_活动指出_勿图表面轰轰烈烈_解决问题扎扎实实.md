Li Tieying on "National Sanitation Month" Activities: Avoid Superficial Fanfare, Solve Problems Thoroughly

	BEIJING, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Regarding the implementation of the "Decision of the State Council on Strengthening Patriotic Hygiene Work" and the arrangement for the nationwide "National Sanitation Month" activities in April this year, Li Tieying today called on local governments at a national teleconference to "solve one or two prominent public health problems for the people each year and accomplish a few practical tasks thoroughly."

	He said that at present, urban sanitation construction in many aspects is not in line with the requirements of reform and opening up. He pointed out: "The mobility of urban population and the circulation of goods have greatly increased the opportunities for the spread and outbreak of diseases. The outbreak of hepatitis A in Shanghai last year, non-A non-B hepatitis in Xinjiang, and conjunctivitis in Beijing fully illustrates this point."

	Li Tieying reminded leaders at all levels of government that to solve the urgent health problems, especially social public health problems, it is necessary to mobilize the masses, rally all forces, and take effective measures. He stressed that one should not be content with superficial fanfare while failing to solve actual problems.

　　李铁映就“爱国卫生月”活动指出
    勿图表面轰轰烈烈  解决问题扎扎实实
    本报北京３月１８日讯  记者艾笑报道：就贯彻《国务院关于加强爱国卫生工作的决定》和布置今年４月在全国开展“爱国卫生月”活动，李铁映今天下午在全国电话会议上要求各地政府，“每年都要为群众实实在在地解决一两个突出的公共卫生问题，扎扎实实地办成几件实事。”
    他谈到，当前城市卫生建设在很多方面还不适应改革开放的要求，指出：“城市人口流动，商品流通，大大增加了疾病传播和流行的机会。去年上海的甲肝、新疆的非甲非乙型肝炎、北京的红眼病的暴发流行，充分说明了这点。”
    李铁映提醒各级政府领导，解决当前迫切的卫生问题，特别是社会性公共卫生问题，必须发动群众，调动各方力量，采取有效措施。不要表面上轰轰烈烈，实际问题不解决。
