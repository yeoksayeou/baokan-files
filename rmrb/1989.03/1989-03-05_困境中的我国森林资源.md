China's forest resources are in a precarious state. The country currently has 115 million hectares of forested land, which accounts for 12% of the total land area of 960 million hectares. The total volume of forest stock is 9.028 billion cubic meters. China's forest area constitutes only about 4% of the world's total forest area. The per capita forest area is 0.11 hectares, and the per capita forest stock volume is 9 cubic meters, ranking 120th and 121st in the world, respectively.

The consumption of forest resources exceeds the sustainable yield. Out of the national forest stock of over 9 billion cubic meters, only about 2 billion cubic meters are available for actual logging. Currently, the annual consumption of timber resources nationwide is approximately 3 billion cubic meters, exceeding the annual growth of usable timber by over 2 billion cubic meters. Apart from the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest regions, which still have some primary forests, most forest areas have gradually transformed into secondary forests. If this trend continues, by the end of the century, more than half of the state-owned forest areas will have no timber left to harvest.

The supply-demand gap is widening. In 1978, China's timber production was 51.62 million cubic meters, and by 1987, it had increased to 64.08 million cubic meters, a growth rate of 2.2% over a decade. During the same period, the annual average growth rate of the national GDP was 7.2%. Despite this, the 1987 timber production was still based on severe over-logging of forest resources. If the annual demand for timber continues to increase by 5-15%, by the end of the century, China's timber supply-demand gap will widen from the current 20 million cubic meters to 50-60 million cubic meters.

　　困境中的我国森林资源
    森林资源过少我国现有林地面积１．１５亿公顷，占国土总面积９．６亿公顷的１２％。森林蓄积量为９０．２８亿立方米。我国森林面积仅占世界森林面积的４％左右，人均森林面积为０．１１公顷，森林蓄积量为９立方米，在世界各国中人均水平分别排在第１２０位和第１２１位。
    资源消耗赤字过大　在全国９０多亿立方米森林蓄积中，实际可采伐利用的林木蓄积量只有２０多亿立方米。现在全国林木资源年消耗量约３亿立方米，超过２亿立方米的用材林生长量积蓄。现在除东北、西北、西南尚有少量成片的原始森林外，大部分林区已逐步演变成次生林地。照此下去，到本世纪末，我国半数以上的国有林区的林业采伐企业将无林可采。
    供需矛盾突出　１９７８年，我国木材产量为５１６２万立方米，１９８７年达到６４０８万立方米，１０年间的增长速度为２．２％，而同期国民生产总值的年均增长速度为７．２％。即便如此，１９８７年的木材产量，也还是建立在森林资源严重过伐的基础上，按全社会对木材需求量每年递增５—１５％计算，到本世纪末，我国木材产需缺口将从现在的２０００万立方米上升到５０００—６０００万立方米。
