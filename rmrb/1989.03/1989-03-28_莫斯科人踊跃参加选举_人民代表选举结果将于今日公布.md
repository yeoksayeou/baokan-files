	Moscow residents enthusiastically participated in the elections for people's representatives. The results of the election will be announced today.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 26th – Today is March 26th, the day when Soviet citizens elect their representatives. In the morning, a light rain fell, and the streets of Moscow were noticeably quieter than usual, with fewer pedestrians and vehicles. On major streets such as Kalinin Avenue and Gorky Street, slogans like "The policy of the CPSU is to improve the lives of Soviet people" and "The Soviet government is a government of the people and for the people" were prominent. Other slogans such as "Moscow people need unity and a common goal" and "The resolution of Moscow's problems depends on the Moscow people" reminded one of the recent rallies held in support of certain candidates.

	From 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM, the reporter visited two polling stations, No. 76 and No. 7. Former First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee and current Deputy Chairman of the State Construction Commission, Yeltsin, had already cast his vote at the first polling station before the reporter arrived. At the second polling station, around 9:00 AM, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Ryzhkov and Chairman of the Russian Supreme Soviet Vorotnikov cast their votes.

	The two polling stations were both simple and solemn in their setup. Behind the ballot boxes stood a statue of Lenin. Voters first received their ballots by presenting their identification, then went to a temporary booth to cross out the name of the candidate they opposed, and finally deposited their ballots in the box. The reporter observed individuals coming alone, couples coming together, and families of three, with children placing the ballots in the box. Whether they were enthusiastic young people or elderly individuals with slow steps, everyone's expression was serious. "Today, I am not just voting for someone; first and foremost, I am voting for reform and democratization," said Feofanov, a 27-year-old worker from a Moscow factory. A middle-aged woman, when asked by the reporter, pointed out, "This election undoubtedly has more democratic elements, and I fully support this approach."

	Moscow has 6.7 million registered voters, divided into 3,393 voting districts, choosing 27 representatives from 82 candidates. The doors of these polling stations, like those across the country, opened at 7:00 AM. Some districts had already seen one-third of their voters cast their ballots by 10:00 AM. Today's election will continue until 8:00 PM. It is reported that the results of the Moscow election will be announced no later than March 28th.

　　莫斯科人踊跃参加选举        
    人民代表选举结果将于今日公布
    据新华社莫斯科３月２６日电  （记者沈法良、王宪举）今天是３月２６日——苏联人民选举人民代表的日子。清晨，细雨蒙蒙，莫斯科街头的行人和车辆比往常明显减少。在市中心加里宁大街和高尔基大街等主要街道上的标语中，以“苏共的政策是改善苏联人的生活”、“苏维埃政权是人民的政权和为人民的政权”这类内容居多。另一类如“莫斯科人需要团结和目标的一致”、“莫斯科市问题的解决取决于莫斯科人”，则使人想起连日来一些人举行的支持某些候选人的群众集会。
    上午１０时至１１时半，记者采访了莫斯科７６号选段和７号选段两个投票站。前莫斯科市委第一书记、现任国家建委第一副主席叶利钦在记者赶到之前已在前一个投票站投了票。在后一个投票站，上午９点多，苏联部长会议主席雷日科夫和俄罗斯最高苏维埃主席沃罗特尼科夫投了票。
    这两个投票站布置既简单又庄严，选票箱后放着一尊列宁塑像，选民们一走进大厅，先凭本人证件领取选票，接着去挂着帘子的临时隔成的小房间内，将所反对的一个候选人的名字划掉，最后将选票投入箱内。记者见到，有单身一人前来的，也有夫妻双双一同来的，还有一家三口来到选票箱前，让孩子将选票投进票箱的。无论是热情洋溢的年轻人，还是步履蹒跚的老年人，表情都很认真。“今天我不是来投某人一票，首先是来投改革和民主化一票”，年仅２７岁的莫斯科某工厂工人费奥法诺夫说。一位中年妇女在回答记者的提问时指出：“这次选举无疑具有更多的民主性，我非常赞成这种做法。”
    莫斯科登记注册的选民有６７０多万，分别在３３９３个选段投票，从８２个候选人中选出２７名人民代表。这些选票站的大门同全国一样，从清晨７点便已打开。有的选段到上午１０时，已有１／３选民投了票。今天的选举将持续到晚上８时结束。据悉，莫斯科选举的结果，最迟将于３月２８日公诸于众。
