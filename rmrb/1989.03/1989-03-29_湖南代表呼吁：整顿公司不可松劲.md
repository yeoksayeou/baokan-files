Hunan delegates urge: Company rectification must not relax

	Reporter: Zhū Wéiqún

	"How do you evaluate the progress of rectifying the order in the circulation sector and cleaning up various types of companies?" The responses from several Hunan People's Congress delegates were unanimous: The achievements should not be overestimated, and the severity of the problems and the arduousness of the tasks ahead should not be underestimated.

	Professor Hè Xiáng, a member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and a faculty member at the Hunan Provincial Commercial Management Cadres Academy, and Tán Jǐngyáng, the director of the Standing Committee of the Hengyang People's Congress, told the reporter, "Currently, the three issues that the public is most concerned about are price increases, unfair distribution, and corruption in government and party organs, all of which are directly related to the 'company phenomenon.' Behind the 'company phenomenon,' there are issues of blurring the lines between government and enterprise, officials and businessmen, power and money exchanges, and the lack of enforcement of laws. In 1982 and 1985, the country also conducted clean-ups of companies. In 1985, there were 380,000 companies of various types nationwide, and 180,000 were cleaned up at that time. However, before this clean-up, the number of large and small companies had increased to 477,000, with 63% being purely commercial. Why are there more companies after each clean-up? This shows that the central government underestimated the difficulty of the clean-up, and the loopholes in policies and systems have not been plugged. If this investigation is not thorough, deepening the reform will be out of the question."

	Former Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee Qí Shòuliáng expressed deep concern about whether this clean-up would be a mere formality. "Separating party and government officials from companies is something that should be relatively easy to achieve during the clean-up. According to the government work report, 30% of people have not yet been separated. None of the five major companies in our country have yet to announce the results of their clean-up. There are still 134 ministerial-level officials serving in companies. Hunan has seized over 130 smuggled cars from Guangdong, many of which are from large units. It is difficult for Hunan alone to trace their origins, let alone handle them further." He said, "Many grassroots officials have the attitude of 'the moon moves, and I move too.' The leading organs at all levels, especially the various ministries under the State Council, should set an example for the grassroots."

	How can this company clean-up avoid being a mere formality?

	Representatives Qí Shòuliáng and Tán Jǐngyáng believe that it is necessary to change the status quo of "investigating small cases but not large ones, investigating lower levels but not higher ones, investigating soft targets but not hard ones, investigating incidents but not individuals." The leading organs should publicly handle a number of companies with serious illegal behaviors, severe economic disruptions, and "backers" to increase transparency and give people a warning in their minds and boost their confidence. The company clean-up should not be time-limited; it should be thorough until the illegal companies are completely cleaned up, eliminating the hope of illegal companies.

	Sūn Zhènhuá, the director of the Yiyang Regional Administrative Bureau, believes that the frequent policy changes in recent years have made company behaviors and administrative management behaviors lack a basis. Often, the same issue has different legal interpretations from year to year and from department to department, giving those who seek personal gain an opportunity. In Hunan, in addition to the provincial people's congress, several large systems also operate companies, and even public security, auditing, organizational, and united front departments also operate companies. This is also related to unclear and lax policies. Therefore, it is necessary to accelerate the improvement of relevant policies on the basis of democratic and scientific procedures and stabilize policies.

	Representative Hè Xiáng said: Currently, the company clean-up is led by the government's Industrial and Commercial Bureau, Supervision Bureau, and Audit Bureau. However, those companies that can sell permits and make big money are often government-owned companies, making it easy for them to be "blinded by their own authority." It is suggested to give full play to the supervisory role of the people's congress and establish the authority of the people's congress and its standing committee in the clean-up. First, the National People's Congress should organize a special investigation team to clean up and dissect a few influential companies.

### 湖南代表呼吁：整顿公司不可松劲

　　湖南代表呼吁：        
    整顿公司不可松劲
    本报记者  朱维群
    “对于整顿流通领域秩序、清理各类公司的进展情况，您作怎样估价？”几位人大湖南代表的回答完全一致：对成绩不宜估计过高，对问题的严重性和下阶段任务的艰巨性不宜估计过低。
    湖南省商业管理干部学院教授、民建中央委员何祥、湘潭市人大常委会主任谭景阳代表对记者说，目前群众意见最大的三个问题：物价上涨、分配不公和党政机关腐败现象，都与“公司现象”直接关联。“公司现象”的背后，是政企不分、官商不分、权钱交易和有法不依。１９８２年和１９８５年全国也曾清理过公司。１９８５年全国有各类公司３８万个，当时清理掉１８万个。而这次清理前，大小公司反而增长到４７．７万个，其中６３％是纯商业性的。为什么越清越多？这说明中央对清理难度估计不足，政策和制度上的漏洞没有堵住。如果这次清查仍不彻底，深化改革就无从谈起。
    原湖南省人大常委会副主任齐寿良对这次清查会不会走过场深表担忧。“党政干部与公司脱钩本来是清查中比较容易办到的事，据政府工作报告，迄今仍有３０％的人未脱钩。我国五大公司至今仍没有一家公布清查结果。有１３４名部长级干部还在公司任职。湖南卡住从广东走私过境的小汽车１３０多部，其中不少是大单位干的，仅依靠湖南很难查清其来源，更难处理下去。”他说，基层不少人对治理整顿的态度是“月亮走，我也走”，各级领导机关、首先是国务院各部委应当给基层作出表率来。
    怎样才能使这次清查公司不再走过场？
    齐寿良、谭景阳代表认为，必须改变“查小不查大、查下不查上、查软不查硬、查事不查人”的状态。领导机关有必要公开处理一批有重大违法行为、严重扰乱经济的、有“后台”的公司，实行办案公开化，增加透明度，在思想上给人们敲响警钟、增进信心。清查公司不应在时间上封顶，彻底查清为止，打掉违法公司的侥幸心理。
    益阳地区行政公署专员孙振华认为，这几年政策多变使公司行为和行政管理行为缺少依据，往往同一件事，合法与非法，一年一个说法，一个部门一个说法，给以权谋私以可乘之机。在湖南，除省人大外，几个大系统都办公司，甚至公安、审计、组织、统战部门也办公司，这也与政策不明不严有关。因此，要在民主、科学程序的基础上加快完善有关政策、稳定政策。
    何祥代表说：目前清查公司是由政府的工商局、监察部和审计局牵头，而那些能够倒卖批文、弄大钱的公司往往又是政府自己的公司，自己清查自己容易“当局者迷”。建议发挥人大的监督作用，树立人大及其常委会在清查中的权威。首先是全国人大应组织专案调查组，清查、解剖几个影响大的公司。
