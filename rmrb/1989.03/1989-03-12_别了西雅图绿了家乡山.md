Upon arriving at the fruit orchard of Guangdong Province Taishan County Datong Development Limited Company, one can see that the previously barren hills have now been covered with patches of green, and oranges hang from the branches. The joyous faces of the people cannot help but praise Uncle Chen Rongchang for developing the barren hills to plant fruit trees, saying he has foresight and vision.

The people refer to Uncle Chen Rongchang as Chen Rongchang, a Taishan native who returned from the United States. Mr. Chen left home at a young age and operated a restaurant and ski resort in Seattle, USA. When his hometown opened up, in 1983 he returned home to visit relatives. One day, he strolled to the back of the village to Luoshan, seeing a large expanse of small hills that were completely bare. Chen Rongchang thought of many overseas Chinese who had started businesses by developing farms, and he thought, "If this place is developed well, it would be very good."

When he proposed this idea, someone asked, "Where will the funds come from?" He replied, "I will invest."

He returned to Seattle, handing over his business to his younger brother and son to manage, and then returned to his hometown to establish the "Datong Development Limited Company," which shares the same name as his overseas business. His actions received support from the town and county leaders, who helped him secure the land lease contract and obtain the business license.

He hired some young people from the village to plant fruit trees on the barren hills. To turn the farm into a high-quality fruit export base, in recent years he has introduced more than twenty excellent varieties. High-quality fruit varieties such as American lemons, grapefruits, and Japanese summer oranges have now settled here.

Under the diligent efforts of the workers, the Datong Company gradually prospered. The kumquats planted in 1985 yielded over a hundred tons last year, most of which were exported to the Hong Kong and Macau markets, gaining a reputation for their juiciness, sweetness, and lack of seeds. By 1990, his business on the barren hills will have recovered all the initial investments.

　　别了西雅图绿了家乡山
    广东  黄仁夫  李克真
    来到广东省台山县大同开发有限公司的林果场，只见过去的荒山秃岭，如今蒙上了片片绿色，柑橙挂满枝头。面露喜悦的人们无不称赞荣畅叔开发荒山种林果，够眼光，有远见。
    人们说的荣畅叔，是台山县旅美乡亲陈荣畅。陈先生少年离家，在美国西雅图经营酒楼和雪山旅游业。家乡开放了，一九八三年他还乡探亲。一天，他漫步来到村后的螺山，见到这一大片小山丘陵地，光秃秃的。陈荣畅想到许多旅美华人就是靠办农场搞开发创了业，便想：如果把这个地方营建好多好。
    他这个想法一提出，有人便问，“资金哪里来？”他说：“我来投资。”
    他返回西雅图，把生意交给了弟弟和儿子管理，便回到了家乡，筹办与海外实业相同名字的“大同开发有限公司”。他的行动，得到了镇、县领导的支持，给他办妥了租地合同，取得了经营执照。
    他雇请了村里一些年青人，在荒山上种果树。为了把农场办成优质水果出口基地，近几年他先后引进了二十多个优良品系，美国的柠檬、柚子，日本夏橙等优质水果品种已在这里落了户。
    在辛勤汗水浇灌下，大同公司逐步兴旺起来，一九八五年种下的椪柑，去年已试挂果，收获一百多吨，大多出口到港澳市场，以其汁多、味甜、无渣而获得声誉。到一九九○年，他在荒山上创办的事业可收回全部投资。
