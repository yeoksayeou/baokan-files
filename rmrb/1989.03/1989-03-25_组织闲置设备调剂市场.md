Recently, we conducted a survey of the 10 industrial enterprises under our branch office and found that these enterprises have 175 idle machines (units), with a net value of 824,200 yuan, resulting in a significant waste of fixed assets.

The reasons for the idling of equipment are as follows:

First, some enterprises blindly expanded their fixed asset investment scale, purchasing equipment that was not used and left idle. Among these 175 idle machines (units), 18 are brand new, with a value of over 320,000 yuan.

Second, enterprises that have stopped production or changed production lines have resulted in some equipment being idle. For example, after the original Tangshan Second Dyeing and Chemical Factory changed its production to enzymes, 9 machines were idled, with a net value of over 330,000 yuan.

Third, some enterprises have updated their equipment, leaving many old machines idle.

We believe that the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China should leverage its advantages of having many branches, wide coverage, timely information, and smooth settlement channels to organize a market for idle equipment within a certain scope. Various forms should be adopted to ensure that idle equipment finds a use.

　　组织闲置设备调剂市场
    最近，我们调查了我办事处所辖的１０家工业企业，发现这些企业闲置设备１７５台（件），净值８２．４２万元，造成固定资产的极大浪费。
    造成设备闲置的原因是：
    一、有的企业盲目扩大固定资产投资规模，买来的设备没有使用就被闲置。这１７５台（件）闲置设备中，有１８台（件）是全新设备，价值３２万多元。
    二、企业停产转产，造成一些设备闲置。原唐山市第二染料化工厂改产酶制剂后，闲置设备９台，净值达３３万多元。
    三、有的企业搞设备更新，闲置不少旧机器。
    我们认为，工商银行应发挥点多、面广、信息灵、结算渠道畅通等优势，在一定范围内组织闲置设备调剂市场，采取多种形式使闲置设备有用武之地。
