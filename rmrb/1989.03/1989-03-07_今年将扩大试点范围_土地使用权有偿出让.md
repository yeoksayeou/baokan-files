Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 6th.

This year, China will expand the pilot scope for the paid transfer of state-owned land use rights to further promote the commodification of real estate.

Yu Limin, Director of the Construction Land Department of the State Land Management Bureau, said in an interview with a reporter from this agency today that some large and medium-sized cities, including several inland cities, will be approved later this year to carry out this work. However, he did not disclose the specific city names.

Yu Limin said that this marks the beginning of China's reform of paid transfer of land use rights, which will gradually expand from the economically developed eastern coastal regions to the western inland provinces.

According to the director, the State Land Management Bureau will soon hold a training class for local government land management officials to systematically introduce relevant legal points and domestic and international experiences and practices, in order to facilitate the deepening of this reform.

    今年将扩大试点范围
　　土地使用权有偿出让
    新华社北京３月６日电  （记者陈新）中国今年将扩大国有土地使用权有偿出让的试点范围，以进一步推动不动产的商品化进程。
    国家土地管理局建设用地司司长余立明今天在接受本社记者采访时说，包括若干内地城市在内的一些大、中城市将在今年晚些时候获得批准，开展这项工作。但他没有透露具体市名。
    余立明说，这标志着中国土地使用权有偿出让的改革将从经济发达的东部沿海地区向西部内陆省份逐渐扩展。
    据这位司长介绍，国家土地管理局将于近期举办一个由地方政府的土地管理官员参加的培训班，向他们系统介绍有关的法律要点和国内外的经验及做法，以利于这项改革的深入开展。
