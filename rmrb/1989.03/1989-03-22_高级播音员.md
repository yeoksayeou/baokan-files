At 9 a.m. on March 20th, the first small group discussion of the News and Publishing Group began on time. First, an elder read the speech given by the secretary-general of the CPPCC at the meeting of the group leaders. The voice was resonant, clear, and rhythmic, like that of a radio announcer. This elder was none other than Song Shaoguang, a member of the Central People's Broadcasting Station's Broadcasting Department and a broadcasting guide.

After the meeting, someone exclaimed: "Last year, the News and Publishing Group had a 'senior translator,' and this year, we have a 'senior broadcaster.' It's truly a gathering of talents."

　　高级播音员
    ３月２０日上午９时，新闻出版组第一次小组讨论会准时开始，首先由一位长者宣读政协大会秘书长在各组召集人会议上的讲话。听那声音，洪亮，清晰，富有节奏感，像电台播音员的声音。这个长者，正是中央人民广播电台播音部的播音指导耿绍光委员。会后有人赞叹：去年新闻出版小组有个“高级翻译”，今年又出了个“高级播音员”，真是人才济济。
