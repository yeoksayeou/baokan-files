	Together Day and Night, No Worries Behind
	Poem by Liu Lianyong

	Row through the radiant glow of the sunset
	Row into the soft light of the moon
	You have one oar
	I have one oar
	The sky is vast, the road is long, love is deep
	Birds return to their nests through the twilight
	Mist lingers on the reeds
	The waves no longer sway
	The heart no longer wavers
	Gentle wind, gentle water, gentle heart
	Life is like a small boat
	Years stand on the shore watching
	You are one oar
	I am one oar
	Dreams, fantasies, distant thoughts

　　朝夕相伴　后顾无忧
    刘连勇配诗
    划出灿灿的霞影
    划进溶溶的月光
    你有一只桨
    我有一只桨
    天长　路长　情长
    归鸟穿过黄昏回巢
    薄雾沿着苇叶徜徉
    浪儿不再摇
    心儿不再漾
    柔风　柔水　柔肠
    生活像只小船
    岁月站在岸边瞩望
    你是一只桨
    我是一只桨
    梦想　幻想　遐想
