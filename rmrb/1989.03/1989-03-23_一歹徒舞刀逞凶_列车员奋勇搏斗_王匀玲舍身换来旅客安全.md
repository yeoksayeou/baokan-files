A meeting was held by the Guiyang Railway Bureau on March 21 to commend a female train attendant, Wang Yunling, who sacrificed her life to protect passengers' safety by bravely fighting against a murderer. The Guizhou Provincial People's Government posthumously awarded Wang Yunling the title of "Revolutionary Martyr."

On the morning of February 19 at 6:10 AM, a man named Sun Fengxue from Dapang County, Guizhou Province, who was standing between cars 7 and 8 on the 152nd passenger train from Guiyang to Shanghai, suddenly pulled out a butcher knife over a foot long and stabbed a young man standing next to him. Wang Yunling, upon seeing this, immediately shouted, "Don't kill!" and rushed forward to try to disarm him. Unfortunately, the assailant turned and stabbed Wang Yunling, the blade piercing her right abdomen. Wang Yunling immediately fell to the ground, blood gushing from her wound.

The assailant did not stop there; he continued his rampage into cars 8 and 9. After a 20-minute struggle, the train attendants, the train conductor, the security personnel, and the passengers finally subdued the murderer, preventing further casualties. Wang Yunling, due to her severe injuries, died a heroic death at the age of 23.

　　一歹徒舞刀逞凶　列车员奋勇搏斗        
    王匀玲舍身换来旅客安全
    本报贵阳３月２２日电  记者潘帝都报道：２１日，贵阳铁路分局召开大会，表彰为保护旅客生命安全，勇斗杀人凶手，以身殉职的女列车员王匀玲。贵州省人民政府授予王匀玲“革命烈士”称号。
    今年２月１９日凌晨６时１０分，由贵阳开往上海的１５２次旅客列车行至浙赣线坑口至枫岭头区间时，站在７号与８号车厢连接处的贵州省大方县农民孙凤学突然拿出一把一尺多长的杀猪刀，向在其身旁的一个男青年刺去。王匀玲见此情景，立即上前大声喝止道：“不许杀人！”随即冲上前欲夺其刀。不料，凶手竟向冲上前的王匀玲刺杀过来，一刀正刺中她的右腹部。王匀玲当即倒地，鲜血直往外涌。
    凶手并不罢休，又冲进８号车厢、９号车厢继续行凶。列车员、列车长、乘警及旅客经过２０多分钟的搏斗，终于将杀人凶犯生擒，避免了更大的伤亡。王匀玲因伤势过重，光荣牺牲，年仅２３岁。
