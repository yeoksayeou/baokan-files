In city buses, the priority seats designated for the "elderly, weak, sick, disabled, pregnant, and those carrying infants" are clearly marked. However, in reality, these individuals often find themselves "standing" next to the seats occupied by strong young men or fashionable young women.

Why have the priority seats undergone such a transformation? Let's first examine the "six criteria" for these seats. At least the criteria of "sick" and "weak" are debatable. Regarding "sick," it is difficult to determine whether a passenger is genuinely ill or feigning illness, and it is impractical to ask those sitting in the priority seats to present their medical records. As for minor ailments like a runny nose, toothache, or a small cut, while they may not be considered serious illnesses, they also do not necessarily require a priority seat. As for "weak," the standard itself is vague, leading to different interpretations.

Perhaps it is because the criteria for who can sit in the priority seats are not clear enough, leading to some young people taking advantage and occupying these seats. In light of this, I suggest that the criteria for priority seats be revised to include "elderly, disabled, pregnant women, and those carrying infants." This may cause some inconvenience to the sick and weak, but it can prevent some unreasonable behavior and make it difficult for those taking advantage to justify their actions. Additionally, it would be beneficial for the bus company to establish a rule: impose a high fine on passengers who do not qualify for the priority seats but refuse to vacate them. I wonder what others think about this?

The transformation of priority seats tells us that socialist spiritual civilization cannot be formed naturally and is not guaranteed by mere "regulations" or "rules." What is crucial and challenging is specific practice.

　　专座的蜕变
    周冠生
    城市公共电汽车上“老、弱、病、残、孕及怀抱婴儿”者的“专座”字样，举目可见。而实际情形却是老、弱、病、残、孕及怀抱婴儿者，往往“专站”在身强力壮的男子汉或年轻时髦的女郎的座位旁。
    专座何以“蜕变”？先且推敲一下专座的“六条标准”，至少“病”和“弱”两条值得商榷。以“病”而论，很难判断乘客真病假病，亦不可能让坐专座者出示病历卡；至于鼻塞牙疼，指头破皮发炎，虽不能说不是“病”，但也不是非坐“专座”不可的。以“弱”而言，则更是仁者见仁、智者见智了，“弱”的标准本身就很模糊。
    也许，正是因为可坐专座者的某些标准不够明确清晰，才导致了专座不专，有些不自觉的年轻人就“钻空子”插了进来。鉴于此，我以为，坐专座者可以改为“老人、残疾人、孕妇、怀抱婴儿者”。这样虽可能使病、弱者受些委屈，但却可以避免一些不得理也不认错的现象，能使钻空子者难以相安。另外，不妨建议公共汽车公司立下这么一条规矩：对不够资格而赖在“专座”上不走的乘客课以高数额的罚款。不知诸位以为然否？
    专座的“蜕变”告诉我们：社会主义精神文明不能自然形成，也不是有了什么“守则”、“规定”就万事大吉了。重要而艰巨的，恐怕是具体的实践。
