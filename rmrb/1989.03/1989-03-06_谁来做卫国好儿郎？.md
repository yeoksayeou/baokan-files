Who Will Be the Good Sons Defending the Nation?

Gong Suī

After reading the article "The Nation Needs Good Sons" published in this newspaper on February 20, I am filled with sorrow and deep regret!

The military is the foremost component of the state apparatus, and our army has long been known as the "Great Wall." Soldiers are the foundation of the military, just as bricks and stones are the foundation of the Great Wall. If the bricks and stones are not solid, the Great Wall is in danger; if the foundation is not solid, how can the military talk about defeating the enemy and achieving victory?

The ancients said: "War is a matter of life and death, a road to survival or extinction, and it cannot be ignored." Based on my observations, the fundamental reason for the poor quality of soldiers (although it is only a part) lies in the imperfect conscription system and policies, and the inability of the "Conscription Law" to fully exert its due effect.

The "Conscription Law" stipulates that all citizens of our country, regardless of nationality, race, occupation, family background, religious beliefs, and educational level, have the obligation to serve in the military. However, in today's era of commodity economy, young people's employment concepts are no longer the same as before, and those who love their country and are willing to serve in the military are increasingly rare. According to the data, the professions that today's middle school students admire most are entrepreneurs, scientists, artists, engineers, journalists, etc., while those who are willing to join the military are indeed few. In reality, the common phenomenon is: those who are excellent in morality, intelligence, and physical fitness enter universities and vocational schools, and an admission letter decides that they will have nothing to do with military service in peacetime. As our country's education cause develops, the number of people entering universities and vocational schools will only increase, and how many excellent young people will be left for the army to choose from among those who fail the exam?

Indeed, our country is vast, and there are enough soldiers. The attitudes of young people in urban and rural areas, economically developed regions, and impoverished regions towards military service are not the same. But a detailed analysis shows that the situation is equally worrying. In cities, unemployed youth apply for military service in large numbers to secure an "iron rice bowl" (they are the main body of urban soldiers). Although their cultural level is the lowest among their peers in the city, they are the highest level in the army. Unfortunately, few of them are willing to serve diligently, and even fewer are willing to serve beyond their term. In rural areas, young people in impoverished regions are generally willing to enlist, but those places are economically backward and education is underdeveloped. Our country's more than 200 million illiterates are concentrated there. Imagine the cultural quality of soldiers recruited from there, how can they meet the needs of the army's modernization?

In economically developed rural areas, recruiting soldiers is difficult, which is a common phenomenon. Although the preferential treatment is implemented there, failing to complete the recruitment task is not an isolated case. The "Conscription Law" stipulates: Citizens who have the obligation to serve in the military but refuse or evade military registration, after education do not change, should be forced to fulfill their military obligations. But if a unit is composed of too many "forced" recruits, its combat effectiveness can be imagined.

As for the political quality of soldiers, it also proves that the "Conscription Law" is not effectively implemented. In an environment where young people of military age are unwilling to enlist and those who are willing to enlist have low quality, some responsible officials, either for the sake of the task, or for the sake of public security, or for receiving bribes, turn a blind eye to the political examination of recruits. What is baffling is that some people with bad records become troublemakers after enlisting, but no one has heard of anyone being held accountable for issuing the "pass" for their enlistment—although the "Conscription Law" has clear regulations on this. This is also a corner that the law has forgotten.

It can be seen that ensuring the quality of soldiers is not something that can be achieved just by "raising awareness." It is necessary to truly implement the law in conscription. To this end, a series of policies and regulations must be formulated to ensure the effective implementation of the "Conscription Law," and even to reform the current conscription system. Otherwise, the call of the military leaders for "the nation needs good sons" will be in vain.

　　谁来做卫国好儿郎？
    弓虽
    读本报２月２０日刊登的《卫国需要好儿郎》，痛心扼腕，感慨万端！
    军队属国家机器之首，我军历来有“长城”美誉。士兵是军队基础，犹如长城之砖石，砖石不固，长城危乎；基础不坚，军队何谈摧坚往胜？！
    古人云：“兵者，国之大事，生死之地，存亡之道，不可不察也。”以我“察”后之见，造成兵员质量差（尽管是部分）的根本原因，在于兵役制度、政策不健全，《兵役法》难以发挥应有之效力。
    《兵役法》规定：我国公民，不分民族、种族、职业、家庭出身、宗教信仰和教育程度，都有义务服兵役。然而，在商品经济发展的今天，青年的择业观念已非昔日，爱国崇武者愈见稀少。据资料表明，当今中学生崇尚的职业多是企业家、科学家、艺术家、工程师、记者等，而愿从军者实在不多。现实中普遍现象是：德、智、体皆优者进了大学、中专，一张录取书便决定他们在和平时期与当兵绝缘，随着我国教育事业的发展，进入高校和中专的人将会越来越多，而落榜者中究竟还有多少德、智、体皆优的年青可供部队挑选？
    诚然，我国地域辽阔，兵员充足，城镇、农村，经济发达地区和贫困地区的青年对当兵态度不尽相同。但细分析，情况同样令人担忧。在城镇，待业青年为端“铁饭碗”应征者众（他们是城镇兵员的主体）。尽管他们文化程度在城镇同辈中属三流，但却是部队士兵中的最高水平。
    遗憾的是他们中安心服役的不多，愿超期服役的更少。在农村，贫困地区青年虽大都愿意应征，但那里经济落后，教育不发达，我国２亿多文盲大都集中于此。试想从这里征来的兵员，其文化素质如何能适应军队现代化建设的需要？在经济发达的农村，征兵难，已是普遍现象。尽管那里优抚落实，但完不成征兵任务仍非个别。《兵役法》虽规定：有服兵役义务的公民拒绝、逃避兵役登记的，经教育不改，应强制其履行兵役义务。但一支部队被“强制”入伍的成份多了，它的战斗力便可想而知。  　至于兵员政治素质问题同样佐证《兵役法》施行之不力。在适龄青年不愿应征和愿应征者素质不高的大环境中，少数有关部门负责人或为任务所迫，或出于治安考虑，或收受贿赂而对应征者政审睁一眼闭一眼。令人费解的是，一些有劣迹者入伍后成为害群之马，但为其入伍发放“通行证”者却不曾听说有谁受到追究——尽管《兵役法》对此有明确规定。这里也是被法律遗忘的角落。
    由此可见，保证兵员质量绝非仅凭“提高认识”所能奏效，非真正依法征兵不可。为此必须制定一系列保证《兵役法》有效施行的政策和规定，直至对现行兵役制度进行改革，否则军队将领们“卫国需要好儿郎”的呼吁难免白喊一嗓子。
