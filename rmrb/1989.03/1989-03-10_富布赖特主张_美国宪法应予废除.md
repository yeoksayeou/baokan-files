The title of this article is taken from the book "The Empire's Values." The author is J. William Fulbright, a prominent figure in American politics who helped the United States re-evaluate China in the 1960s. At 83 years old, he remains intellectually active and perceptive. This book is a compilation of his thoughts and views, written by his longtime assistant, Seth T. Tilman. Tilman is a professor at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., specializing in diplomatic issues. A scholar of American diplomatic history from Yale University commented that this 243-page book can be seen as "Mr. Fulbright's summary of his critical reflections on America's actions in the world." The author refutes the necessity of the United States developing nuclear weapons, condemns America's role as the world's policeman and its interference in the internal affairs of other countries as "foolishness," and views the idea of promoting American political institutions and lifestyle as a "world model" as a narrow-minded perspective.

The most challenging and controversial view in the book is his advocacy for the abolition of the U.S. Constitution, which has been in effect for over two hundred years. The author devotes a significant portion of the book to discussing the drawbacks of the principle of separation of powers, claiming that the U.S. Constitution often causes American leaders to miss opportunities and fall into predicaments when dealing with the most urgent and serious national issues. The author believes that the political system produces presidential candidates and presidents who may lack sufficient experience and leadership abilities to govern. Once a person becomes president, it is difficult to remove them without disrupting the country's political life.

Fulbright has been in politics for many years and is highly respected. He has served as a member of the House of Representatives and the Senate, chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and was the U.S. Ambassador to Japan before his retirement. Therefore, for a political veteran like him to speak so disrespectfully about the political system prescribed by the U.S. Constitution is rare in America's 200-year history. Especially since the United States just held a grand commemoration last year for the 200th anniversary of the Constitution. Many Americans are quite proud of this rare, long-lasting law in the world, treating it as a sacred and inviolable doctrine. Fulbright, however, does not think much of this.

What kind of political system does Fulbright prefer? In the book, he proposes the idea of a parliamentary cabinet system: abolishing the congressional system and establishing only one legislative body, with the head of state or government leader selected by the ruling party from senior legislators. The author believes that leaders produced in this way may be seasoned experts in governance with decades of political experience.

The U.S. Constitution guarantees freedom of speech. Therefore, Fulbright has every right to use the powers granted by the Constitution to comment on the Constitution. As to whether his proposals are feasible, that is another matter.

### 富布赖特主张  “美国宪法应予废除”

　　富布赖特主张
    “美国宪法应予废除”
    陆文岳
    本文标题出自《帝国的价值》一书。作者是蜚声美国政坛、６０年代帮助美国重新认识中国的富布赖特。此公今年８３高龄，仍思想活跃，观察敏锐。此书由他出思想和观点，由其老助手塞思·梯尔曼代笔写成。梯尔曼是华盛顿乔治敦大学研究外交问题的教授。耶鲁大学美国外交史学者说，这部２４３页厚的集子可谓是“富布赖特先生对美国在世界上的所作所为进行批判性思考的总结”。作者批驳美国当年研制核武器的必要性，谴责美国充当世界警察、干预他国内政的“蠢行”，把吹嘘美国政治制度和生活方式为“世界样板”的观点视作“夜郎”之见。
    书中最具挑战性且引起非议最多的观点是，他主张废除已延续两百年的美国宪法。作者以较长的篇幅论述了三权分立原则的弊端，宣称美国宪法常使美国领导人在处理国家最紧迫、最严重问题时延误时机、陷入困境。作者以为，美国政体所产生的总统候选人和总统可能是无足够治国经验和领导才能的政客。一个人一旦成为总统，人们便无法在不扰乱国家政治生活的情况下将他罢免。
    富布赖特从政多年，资深望重，历任众议员和参议员，又任过参院外交委员会主席，退休前是美国驻日本大使。因此，像他这样的政界元老，对美国的宪法规定的政体出言如此不恭，在美利坚２００多年的历史上实属鲜见。特别是去年美国刚为宪法诞生两百周年举行过隆重的纪念活动。许多美国人对这部世界上少见的长寿大法颇感骄傲，将它奉为神圣不可侵犯的金科玉律。对于这一点，富布赖特却颇不以为然。
    富布赖特喜欢什么样的政体呢？他在书中提出了议会内阁一体制的构想：取消国会制，只设一个立法院，国家元首或政府首脑将由执政党从资深议员中遴选。作者认为，以这种方式产生的领导人可能是积有数十年政治经验的治国专家。　　美国宪法规定言论自由。所以，富布赖特完全有权以宪法所赋之权来评说宪法，至于他的设想是否可行，那又是另外一回事了。
