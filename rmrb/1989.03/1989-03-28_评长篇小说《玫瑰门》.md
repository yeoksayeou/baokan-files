Title: Review of the Novel "The Rose Gate"
Author: Qián Zhènnán

In "The Rose Gate," Tie Ning repeatedly writes that all doors in the world are both a rejection and an enticement. I think this can also be used to describe the aesthetic character of her novel. It rejects impatient readers with its overall intricate meaning and obscure language, while it entices and even stimulates readers who are not too lazy to think with its profound exploration of human nature and society, and its calm and precise narrative style. I am both rejected and enticed by it. I have left the novel repeatedly, only to return to it again and again. I feel that it is not easy to say something about it.

However, I am still prepared to accept its challenge.

"The Rose Gate" is a novel about women. Whether in terms of the characters' positions in the overall structure of the novel or the effort the author has put into portraying the characters, we should acknowledge that the old woman, Si Weiwen, is the protagonist. It is in Si Weiwen's long life that the stories of her uncle, Zhu Xi, and Lao Da Ma are interwoven, and it is in her life that the physiological and psychological development of Su Mei, who witnesses the lives of the women in the Si family courtyard in Xiang Shao Hutong with her precocious childish eyes, is depicted. All these women's lives are not isolated; they are entangled with each other, colliding with each other, intertwining love and hatred, gathering and dispersing, sharing hardships, forming a unique symbiotic state. The novel vividly and vividly depicts this typical state of Chinese women's existence with its rich and intricate plot and details.

In the portrayal of Si Weiwen's character, Tie Ning has made some unique artistic contributions.

Firstly, Tie Ning has not only gathered the silhouettes of certain historical events in China's modern history after the May Fourth Movement in Si Weiwen's character, but she has almost gathered the extremely realistic urban life scenes of the entire "Cultural Revolution" period. The most artistically convincing and shocking part of the novel is undoubtedly the true, calm, and unembellished description of the urban psychology during the Cultural Revolution. This description's power in revealing the contradictions in Si Weiwen's existence is astonishing.

Si Weiwen's tragic and pitiful existence during the Cultural Revolution is manifested in a series of profound contradictions: as a woman from an old family who has always lived in a closed environment and has been repeatedly rejected, expelled, and persecuted after liberation when she tried to "stand out" and join the new society, she has an instinctive aversion and fear of the Cultural Revolution; but the Cultural Revolution's desecration and destruction of the order and honorable figures of the "new society" she respects make her feel that "the one who should be closest to this movement is her," which makes her eager to "appear" on a corner of the Cultural Revolution's stage and consciously use the "spirit of the times" and the new customs and norms of the Cultural Revolution that quickly formed to remake herself. She dreams of gaining recognition of her existence value in this unprecedented historical opportunity, but this unprecedented historical opportunity is not prepared for people like her, but for people like Lao Da Ma. Reality still gives her rejection, expulsion, and persecution, and the methods are even more vulgar and cruel. Therefore, Si Weiwen's existence during the Cultural Revolution is a bit like a slapstick performance on a tightrope: from donating furniture and property to reporting her own buried gold ingot; from showing off Zhang Tan's "red armband" to being ready to pose reading the Little Red Book at any time; from causing trouble for the Da Masters in the toilet to learning how to steam steamed buns and offering braised mandarin fish to Lao Da Ma in the kitchen; from intentionally being vague about the whereabouts of her deceased brother-in-law during an external investigation to joining the neighborhood propaganda team to sing model operas; from carefully planning the disgrace of Zhu Xi and Da Qi to blackmailing Lao Da Ma to improve her own situation... She uses every trick, but she is always walking on thin ice. She does make some progress in improving her social image and living conditions, but this progress is within the framework of the distorted urban life scene, and it is the satisfaction of conforming to the abnormal spirit and customs of the entire era, which is a deception and betrayal of her own true desires and feelings. Her surface psychology controls her humble behavior, but her deep emotions despise and even resist her own behavior. Thus, we see: Si Weiwen publicly delivers a confession speech and hands over her furniture while also unable to hold back her tears in the rain and unable to hold back her venting of grievances, resentment, hatred, and anger in front of her uncle; she goes along with Er Qi and San Qi's criticism of Da Huang while also secretly admiring her uncle's cursing of the Luo family... In Si Weiwen, the "mimicry" for the need of survival and the "true self" that flows out to balance her psychology are so perfectly blended. From this old woman's "mimicry," we can see a "too perfect and too hard" real era forged by falsehood; while from her "true self," we can see a truly human soul that is heavily burdened and pressured by history and reality, a soul that is twisted and deformed. From this perspective, the social typicality of Si Weiwen's old woman character is very rich.

Secondly, Tie Ning has not only explored the unique vitality of women's lives hidden under the dust of history and the filth of reality in Si Weiwen's character, but she has also explored the unique cunning, meanness, and ugliness in women's existence and relationships.

Although the novel devotes a lot of ink to describing Si Weiwen's current existence, as a typical character in a typical environment, Si Weiwen has her own character development history of over seventy years. She was once a revolutionary-inclined girl influenced by the May Fourth New Thought in Sheng Xin Girls' School, and she had a brave and passionate rainy night with the young revolutionary Hua Zhiyuan. She "had her own clear pool-like purity and lotus-like innocence." Although fate arranged for her to play the role of a housewife for her entire life, her life was always burning with living desires, and she was always striving to find new opportunities in life. She had a soul that never "freezes," and she had the power to face life in a very realistic way. Although this life force and courage to struggle were limited to a narrow life cage. A woman with extraordinary vitality had to live out a dark and miserable life of no use, this is a tragedy of society, and it is also a tragedy of women.

However, if we think that the theme of Tie Ning's novel is a protest against the suppression and distortion of women's vitality and creativity, and a call for women's right to exist, that would be one-sided. In fact, the main aesthetic emotion of "The Rose Gate" is a disgust with the dark side, ugliness, and meanness of women themselves, and a cold and piercing insight into all negative manifestations of women's existence. In the portrayal of Si Weiwen's character, the author uses a transgressive pen to delve into the character's preconscious, unconscious, and subconscious levels, boldly writing about the special perverted psychology and behavior of this woman who has been in a state of sexual repression in a long and unhappy marriage, and writing about the terrible scars left by the long struggle between strong female instincts and an unchangeable social role. Si Weiwen's enmity and dependence on her uncle is fully expressed through their shared habit of ear-picking, which has a meaning of sexual release. Si Weiwen's mean and boring stalking of Zhu Xi, Si Weiwen's mockery and exposure of Su Mei's secret first love, and her stalking of Su Mei and Ye Longbei's trip to Xiangshan, all stem from a voyeuristic fetish formed by long-term sexual repression. The relationship of mutual suspicion and mutual spying among the women in Xiang Shao Hutong, with Si Weiwen at the center, is to a great extent formed in the shadow of a distorted and abnormal sex culture where women's healthy sexual psychology and sex life cannot develop.

From this perspective, the character of Si Weiwen, this old woman, and her relationship with her fellow women, have a very profound human significance. And this human significance, concretely expressed, gives the female characters in the novel the high degree of individuality required by typical characters, with great artistic value.

"The Rose Gate" is a novel title with rich symbolic meaning. From a mundane perspective, it can specifically refer to the reproductive system that nurtures life; from a transcendental perspective, it symbolizes the mystery of women's lives and existence. Whether in terms of the individual characteristics of women maturing, or in terms of the value of women as a whole in the entire human existence, women are habitually seen as the source of beauty and happiness. Poets throughout history have often used very rose-like language to praise them. But the existence of the women in Tie Ning's pen is far from rosy. The Rose Gate is not rosy, this is Tie Ning's bold discovery and courageous exposure. This is not only an expansion and advancement of the description of female images in art, but it also has reference significance for the study of human sociology and female anthropology.

### 评长篇小说《玫瑰门》

　　评长篇小说《玫瑰门》
    铁凝在《玫瑰门》里不止一次写道：世上所有的门都是一种拒绝亦是一种诱惑。我想这也可以作为对她这部长篇小说的美学性格的一种描述。它以总体意蕴的曲折和局部语言的晦涩拒绝缺乏耐心的读者，同时又以人性与社会内容的深邃和叙事风格的冷静与精确，诱惑着甚至刺激着还不太懒于思考的读者。我就是这样既受着拒绝又受着诱惑。我一次次离开这部小说又一次次回到这部小说。我感到要对它说出点什么并不容易。
    不过我还是准备接受它的挑战。
    《玫瑰门》是一部写女性的小说。无论就人物在小说总体结构中的位置或作家在人物刻画上所花的笔墨来看，我们都应该承认老女人司猗纹是小说的主人公。正是在司猗纹漫长的一生中，交织进去姑爸、竹西、罗大妈各自的故事，交织进去以早熟的童心审视、见证了响勺胡同司家小院里众女生态的苏眉的生理、心理发育过程。所有这些女性的生存都不是孤立的，她们纠缠在一起，碰撞在一起，爱恶交汇，聚散互迭，沧桑与共，形成一种殊态共生状态。小说以极为繁富的情节、细节，错落有致、扣人心弦地写出了这种具备典型性的中国女性的生存状态。
    在对司猗纹形象的塑造上，铁凝提供了一些非常独特的艺术贡献。
    第一，铁凝在司猗纹形象身上，不仅汇聚了“五四”以后中国现代史上某些历史风涛的剪影，而且几乎是汇聚了整个“文革”这一特殊的历史阶段的极为真实的市民生态景观。小说最有艺术说服力和震撼力的部分，无疑是对“文革”时期市民心理的真实的、冷静的、毫不讳饰的描写。这种描写的功力在揭示司猗纹生存中的矛盾方面达到了令人惊叹的程度。
    司猗纹在“文革”中的可悲复可叹的生存状态表现为一连串的深刻矛盾：作为一个出身旧世家的，生活一直处于封闭状态，解放后一再想“站出来”加入新社会却一再被拒绝、被斥逐、被打击的家庭妇女，她对“文革”有一种本能的反感和恐惧；但是，“文革”对她心怀敬畏的“新社会”的秩序和尊荣人物的亵渎和摧毁，又使她觉得“原来最应该和这场运动亲近的还应该是她”，这又使她急于在“文革”的舞台一角“亮相”，相当自觉地用“文革”的“时代精神”和迅速形成的“文革”新习俗、新规范来重塑自己。她幻想在这个前所未有的历史机遇中获得自己生存价值的前所未有的承认，但这个前所未有的历史机遇却不是为她这种人预备的，而是属于罗大妈们的。现实给予她的仍然是拒绝、斥逐、打击，方式甚至更加粗鄙和冷酷。因此，司猗纹在“文革”中的生存状态，就有点像走着钢丝的滑稽表演：从献家具房产到举报自己偷埋的金如意；从炫耀庄坦的“红袖章”到随时准备摆出的读语录姿态；从厕所里给达先生们制造点麻烦到炊事上向罗大妈请教窝头的蒸法和奉送清蒸鳜鱼；从接受外调时有意对已死妹夫的去向含糊其辞到加入街道宣传队唱样板戏；从精心谋划出竹西和大旗的丑到借此要挟罗大妈以改善自己的处境；……她处处用尽心机，但又时时如履薄冰。她在改善自己的社会形象和生存条件上也的确略有进展，但那是在整个社会生态景观被扭曲的大框架中的进展，是迎合整个时代变态的精神与习俗中得到的满足，而这进展和满足无非是对她自己生命的真实欲望和感受的一种蒙蔽和欺骗。她的表层心理支配着卑屈的行为，而她的深层的情绪却卑视、甚至反抗着自己的行为。于是，我们看到：司猗纹一面当众发表忏悔演说并交出家具，同时也抑制不住大雨中涌出的泪水，抑制不住在姑爸面前满腹冤、怨、恨、怒的发泄；她一面附和着二旗、三旗们对大黄的车裂，一面又在心里赞许着姑爸对罗家的骂；……在司猗纹身上，为适应生存的需要而作出的“拟态”与为平衡心理而流露出的“本相”是那样浑和地交融为一体。从这个老女人的“拟态”中可以看到一个由虚假锻造出的“太圆满太坚硬”的真实的时代；而从她的“本相”则可以看到一个重重滑稽的涂饰仍不能掩抑的真实的人的灵魂，那是被历史的重负和现实的压力纵横挤压得扭曲变形的女性的灵魂。从这个层面看，司猗纹这个老女人形象的社会典型意义是非常丰饶的。
    第二，铁凝在司猗纹形象身上，不仅开掘出了历史的烟尘和现实的污垢掩蔽下的女性生命特有的柔韧的活力，而且开掘出了女性生存状态与女性相互关系中特有的狡计、卑琐和丑恶。
    虽然小说大量的笔墨是描写司猗纹现时态的生存状况的，但作为一个典型环境中的典型性格，司猗纹有着自己长达七十余年的性格发展史。她曾是圣心女中的一个受“五四”新思潮影响的倾向革命的少女，她有过和年轻的革命者华致远共同的一个勇敢忘情的雨夜。她“有过自己那池水般的清澈，那睡莲般的纯洁”。虽然命运安排她终其一生只能饰演家庭妇女的角色，但她的生命中始终燃烧着活生生的欲望，始终贯串着寻找生活的新机会的行动，她有一个永不“定格”的灵魂，她有非常现实地面对生活的力量。虽然这生命的力量和抗争的胆识都被先定地限制在一个狭小的生活之笼内。一个有着非凡的生命力的女性，却不得不走完没用人的暗淡凄苦的一生，这是社会的悲剧，也是女性的悲剧。
    但是，如果因此就以为铁凝这部小说的主题是对女性的生命力、创造才能受到压抑和扭曲的抗议，是为女性的生存权利而作的呼吁，那就有失片面了。实际上，《玫瑰门》的主要的美学情绪，是一种对女性本身的阴暗面、丑恶、卑琐的厌恶，是对女性生存状态中一切负面表现的冷峻透视。在对司猗纹形象的刻画上，作家以越轨的笔致，突入了人物的前意识、潜意识和无意识的层面，大胆写出了这个在漫长的不幸婚姻中处于性压抑状态的女性的特殊的变态心理和变态行为，写出了强旺的女性本能与无法更改的社会角色之间长久搏杀留下的可怕伤痕。司猗纹与姑爸那种相仇与相依，通过挖耳道这一带有性宣泄意味的共同嗜好表现得淋漓尽致。司猗纹对竹西的卑鄙捉奸与无聊的跟踪，司猗纹对苏眉的隐秘初恋的嘲弄与告发，还有对苏眉、叶龙北香山之行的跟踪，无不出于一种长期性压抑形成的窥视癖。以司猗纹为中心的响勺胡同诸女性之间互相猜疑、互相窥伺的关系，在很大程度上正是在女性健康的性心理和性生活得不到发展的畸形病态的性文化的阴影中形成的。
    从这个层面上看，司猗纹这个老女人的形象以及她与同性的关系，具有非常深刻的人本意义。而这种人本意义的具象的表现，使小说中的女性形象具有典型性格所要求的高度的个性化的艺术价值。
    “玫瑰门”，这是一个富有象征意味的小说标题。从形而下的意义看，它可以非常具体地指孕育生命的生殖系统；从形而上的意义看，它象征着女性的生命之谜与生存之谜。无论就女性个体的性特征成熟而言，抑或就女性整体在人类整个生存状态中的价值而言，女性都被习惯地看成美和幸福的源泉，古往今来诗人们常用非常玫瑰的语言来赞颂她们。但铁凝笔下的女性的生存状态，却是很不玫瑰的。玫瑰门里不玫瑰，这是铁凝的一个大胆的发现和勇敢的揭发。这不仅是艺术中女性形象描写的拓展和推进，对于人类社会学和女性人类学的研究，也是不无参考意义吧？
