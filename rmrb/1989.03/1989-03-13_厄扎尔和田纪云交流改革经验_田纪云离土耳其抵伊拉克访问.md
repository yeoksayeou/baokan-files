　　厄扎尔和田纪云交流改革经验
    田纪云离土耳其抵伊拉克访问
    新华社伊斯坦布尔３月１１日电  （记者李贤德）土耳其总理厄扎尔今天在这里会见中国副总理田纪云时互相交流了两国在经济改革中的经验。
    厄扎尔高度赞扬中国的经济改革，认为中国决定放慢过快的经济发展速度是非常正确的。他说，中国控制人口增长、实行计划生育是好的，希望中国改革成功。
    厄扎尔介绍了土耳其在经济改革中取得成绩和存在的问题。他说，土耳其在经济建设中遇到经济发展速度过快、通货膨胀等问题，其主要原因是人口增长快、投资过量、出现城市化现象。为了解决这些问题，土耳其放慢了经济发展速度，保持预算平衡，以防止赤字。
    田纪云说，中土的经济改革都取得了巨大成绩，同时存在着类似的问题。因此，两国领导人经常保持接触、交换意见和经验，互相学习、取长补短，很有必要。
    新华社巴格达３月１１日电　中国副总理田纪云今晚从土耳其抵达这里，开始对伊拉克进行为期４天的友好访问。
    田纪云在到达后发表的书面讲话中说，在这次访问期间，他将会晤伊拉克一些领导人，双方将就一些国际和其他共同关心的问题交换意见。他们将讨论如何进一步发展两国间的友好关系。
    田纪云表示相信，他的这次访问将促进中伊两国间的相互理解和有助于合作关系的发展。
