South Yugo and Hungary leaders hold working meeting

	New York Times, Belgrade, February 27 - The Chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Shuvard, and the General Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Grosz, held a brief working meeting today in the Yugoslav border city of Belje.

	During the meeting, Shuvard introduced the political system reforms, economic reforms, and League of Communists reforms that Yugoslavia is currently undertaking, as well as the current tense situation in Kosovo. Grosz introduced Hungary's current political and economic situation, the roots of the 1956 events, and the implementation of a multi-party system. He said that Hungary hopes that Yugoslavia remains a stable, non-aligned socialist country, and that Hungary has always been concerned about Yugoslavia's development and its socialist path.

	Grosz also stated in an interview with the Yugoslav News Agency yesterday that Hungary's implementation of a multi-party system is a new thing, but not a historic event. It can reduce some wrong decisions, but it cannot guarantee that no mistakes will be made. Various parties can supervise each other, but more importantly, they must follow the law, maintain openness, and reform the election methods of leaders at all levels.

　　南匈领导人举行工作会晤
    新华社贝尔格莱德２月２７日电  南共联盟中央主席团主席舒瓦尔和匈牙利社会主义工人党总书记格罗斯今天在南斯拉夫边境城市贝列举行了短暂的工作性会晤。
    在会晤中，舒瓦尔介绍了南斯拉夫进行的政治体制改革、经济改革、共盟改革以及科索沃当前的紧张局势。格罗斯介绍了匈牙利当前政治经济形势、造成１９５６年事件的根源以及将实行多党制等问题。他说，匈牙利希望南斯拉夫是一个稳定的不结盟的社会主义国家，匈牙利一直关注着南的发展及其所走的社会主义道路。
    格罗斯昨天在向南通社发表谈话时还指出，匈牙利实行多党制是一件新鲜事，但不是历史性事件，它可以减少一些错误决定，但不能保证不犯错误。各党可以相互监督，但更重要的是遵守法律、公开性和改革各级领导人的选举方式。
