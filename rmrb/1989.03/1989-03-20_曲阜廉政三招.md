In recent years, Qufu City in Shandong Province has been focusing on rectifying party discipline and promoting integrity and anti-corruption efforts. In addition to conducting ideological education, the city has implemented three effective strategies.

1. **Publicizing Government Affairs**: Starting in 1987, Qufu City has held a public meeting every half year, where leaders report their work and answer questions from the public. The public then votes anonymously to evaluate the leaders' performance. These scores are recorded in the leaders' files and serve as a primary basis for rewards and punishments. This measure has accelerated the correction of errors by officials who have been criticized by the public.

2. **Leveraging Media Supervision**: The city's Party Committee and government have explicitly stated that they will not interfere with news organizations' criticism of leaders' illegal and disciplinary violations. In January, *China Youth Daily* published an article criticizing Qufu's leadership. A deputy editor of *Qufu Daily* found the article reasonable and, without seeking approval, published it as a front-page headline. Instead of facing repercussions, he was praised by the mayor and the deputy secretary of the Party Committee. A staff member from the city's Propaganda Department accompanied a Beijing journalist for several days, resulting in a critical report. This staff member was later named an advanced individual in the city's Party Committee.

3. **Rule of Law in Governance**: Since 1986, Qufu City has hired a full-time legal advisor to participate in government decision-making and act as the mayor's legal representative. Major decisions, plans, and contracts are consulted with legal experts before implementation. This practice has now been extended to townships and 32 key enterprises in the city. Legal professionals' involvement in political and economic activities has also helped curb illegal and disciplinary violations.

　　曲阜廉政三招
    福华　晓唐
    近年来，山东省曲阜市在整顿党风、倡廉肃贪方面，除了进行思想教育外，用了三招，收到实效。
    一、政务公开化。从１９８７年开始，曲阜市从上到下，每半年举行一次群众大会，领导干部公开述职、回答群众质疑，并由群众当场无记名投票考评打分。考评分数记入档案，作为奖惩的主要依据。这一措施执行后，有些沾染官僚作风或不正之风的干部，在群众批评后，改正错误快了。
    二、发挥新闻舆论的监督作用。市委、市府明文规定，不干预新闻单位对领导干部违法乱纪行为进行批评报道。今年１月，《中国青年报》发表了一篇批评曲阜市领导的评论，《曲阜报》一位副总编辑看罢觉得有理，未经请示，就在该报一版头条转载了这篇文章。事后，他不但没受到任何责难，相反，却受到了市长、市委副书记的表扬。市委宣传部的一位干部，陪同北京的一位记者东跑西颠好几天，最后这位记者写了篇批评报道。这位宣传干部年底被评为市委机关先进个人。
    三、依法治市。曲阜市１９８６年就聘请了常年法律顾问，参与政府决策，并担任市长委托代理人。市里的重大决策、计划、合同，都要向法律专家咨询，才付诸执行。这一做法，现在已普及到乡镇及３２家市骨干企业。法律人员参与政治和经济活动，对违法乱纪行为也起到了遏制作用。
