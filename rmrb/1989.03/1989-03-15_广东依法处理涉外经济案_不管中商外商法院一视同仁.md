The courts in Guangdong Province have been handling foreign economic disputes in accordance with the law, treating Chinese and foreign parties equally, effectively dispelling some doubts that foreign investors have about China's investment environment and legal system.

In recent years, the number of economic disputes involving foreign countries and Hong Kong and Macau in Guangdong has increased, with greater disputes and a wider range. Statistics show that last year, 241 such cases were accepted, an increase of 23.2% compared to 1987, involving parties from more than 10 countries and regions.

For these cases, the courts at various levels treat Chinese parties and foreign and Hong Kong and Macau parties equally. The Guangdong High People's Court has also reached an agreement with the Hong Kong High Court for mutual service of civil and commercial litigation documents. Since its implementation in July last year, it has solved the problem of effective service of litigation documents for the parties involved.

　　 广东依法处理涉外经济案
    不管中商外商法院一视同仁
    本报广州３月１４日电  记者梁兆明报道：广东省各级人民法院在受理涉外经济纠纷案中，坚持法律面前一律平等原则，有效地消除了一些外商对我国投资环境和法制的疑虑。
    近年来，广东涉及外国和港澳地区的经济纠纷案件数量增加，争议增大，范围也更广。据统计，去年受理这类案件共２４１件，比１９８７年增加２３．２％，涉及的当事人有１０多个国家和地区。
    对于这类案件，各级人民法院对中国当事人与外国、港澳地区当事人一视同仁。省高级人民法院还与香港最高法院达成了相互委托送达民事、商事诉讼文书的协议，去年７月起实施后，解决了当事人的诉讼文书无法有效送达的困难。
