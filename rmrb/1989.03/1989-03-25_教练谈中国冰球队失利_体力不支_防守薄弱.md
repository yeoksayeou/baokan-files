	Coach Discusses Chinese Ice Hockey Team's Loss
	Fatigue and Weak Defense

	Xinhua News Agency, Canberra, March 23 (Reporter Xu Yuannai) After losing to the Dutch team 5-8 in the fourth match of the C group in the World Ice Hockey Championship today, coach Li Wenhong discussed the reasons for the Chinese team's defeat.

	Li Wenhong believes that the Chinese team played well in the first period, with players actively defending and seizing opportunities for quick counterattacks. In this period, the Chinese team led 2-1. In the second period, the Chinese players' stamina declined, making it difficult for them to adapt to the Dutch team's fast-paced attacks and physical collisions. Their performance became somewhat frantic, and their defense had gaps. He believes that the Chinese team's defenders pressed too deep into the opponent's attacking zone, creating a situation where they had to defend against multiple opponents. Additionally, the Chinese defenders' one-on-one skills were not as good as their opponents, and their defensive zone was frequently penetrated by the Dutch team. The Chinese team trailed 0-3 in the second period. In the third period, although the Chinese team played more relaxed, they still trailed.

　　教练谈中国冰球队失利        
    体力不支　防守薄弱
    新华社堪培拉三月二十三日电  （记者许钺乃）中国冰球队今天在世界冰球锦标赛Ｃ组第四场比赛中，以五比八输给荷兰队后，教练李文宏谈了中国队失利原因。
    李文宏认为，中国队第一局的比赛打得较好，队员们积极防守，并趁机快速反攻，这一局中方以二比一领先。第二局，中方队员体力下降，难以适应对方高大队员的快速进攻和身体冲撞，表现有些急躁，防守出现了漏洞。他认为，中国队后卫在对方攻区压得过深，造成以多打少的局面。另外，中方后卫一对一能力不及对手，防区多次被荷兰队突破。第二局中国队以零比三落后。第三局，中国队虽打得较轻松，但仍落后。
