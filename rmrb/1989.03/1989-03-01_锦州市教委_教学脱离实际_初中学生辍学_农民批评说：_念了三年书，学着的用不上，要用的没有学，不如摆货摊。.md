		The Jinxing City Education Commission conducted a survey of all 257 middle schools in the city and found that 16,927 students had dropped out, accounting for 8% of the total student population.

		Why has the phenomenon of middle school students dropping out become increasingly severe?

		The fundamental reason is that teaching is detached from reality and does not meet the needs of socialist commodity economy. Each year, Jinxing City has over 20,000 middle school graduates entering high school, vocational schools, and technical schools, accounting for 28% of the total graduates. Among them, only 17.2% of rural graduates continue their studies, while over 35,000 graduates return to their villages to engage in agriculture. A follow-up survey of these students who return to the countryside revealed that they are not well-adapted to the new economic situation in rural areas in terms of ideology, morality, cultural knowledge, and physical and mental health. Farmers criticize, "After studying for three years, what we learned is not useful, and what we need to know, we didn't learn. It's better to set up a stall, go to the sea to catch fish and shrimp, or use a scale."

		In contrast, some rural middle schools in Jinxing City have introduced vocational and technical education, reformed the teaching structure and content, established junior vocational and technical classes, and implemented internal streaming within middle schools. Although these students have a slightly weaker foundation in cultural courses, they have not dropped out. Graduates from vocational and technical classes are playing a leading role in rural areas and are well-received locally. It is evident that reforming teaching content and increasing vocational and technical education is one way to reduce the dropout rate of rural middle school students.

　　锦州市教委——
    教学脱离实际　初中学生辍学
    农民批评说：“念了三年书，学着的用不上，要用的没有学，不如摆货摊。”
    锦州市对全市２５７所初中进行调查，辍学生达１６９２７名，占在校生总数的８％。
    为什么现在初中生辍学现象日趋严重？
    教学脱离实际，不能适应社会主义商品经济的需要，是造成学生大量辍学的根本原因之一。锦州每年升入高中、中专和技校的初中毕业生２万余名，占毕业生总数的２８％，其中农村毕业生升学的仅占１７．２％，有３．５万多名毕业生回乡务农。我们对回乡务农的学生追踪调查，发现他们面对目前农村新的经济形势，在思想道德、文化知识和身体心理素质等方面很不适应。农民批评说：“念了三年书，学着的用不上，用上的没学着。不如摆货摊、赶小海（到海里摸鱼捞虾）、耍秤杆。”与此相反，锦州市的一些农村初中引进职业技术教育，改革教学结构和内容，办初级职业技术班，实行初中内部分流。这部分学生的文化课基础稍差，却仍然没有辍学。从职业技术班毕业的学生正在农村发挥骨干作用，很受当地的欢迎。可见改革教学内容，增加职业技术，是减少农村初中生辍学的办法之一。
