Poetry is the soul of painting, and painting is the essence of poetry. This is one of the distinctive features of the works created by the middle-aged painter Chen Wei. He paints either by first writing poetry and then painting, or by painting first and then adding poetry, paying great attention to the fusion of emotion and scenery, and the integration of poetry and painting. From his recent poetry and painting exhibition held at the China Art Museum, one can appreciate his achievements in this area, as well as his unremitting spirit of exploration in the art of poetry and painting.

Chen Wei was born in 1938 in Nanshan, Puning, Guangdong. From a young age, he has been deeply fond of poetry and painting. Over the decades, he has traveled extensively throughout the famous rivers and mountains of his motherland, taking nature as his teacher. At the same time, he has diligently studied the essence of traditional art, humbly seeking guidance from senior artists, and through tens of thousands of drafts, continuously refining his skills. He has created more than 1,000 works, including grand scrolls such as "A Panorama of the Yangtze River," "Beijing: Sixteen Scenes," and "The Five Great Mountains," as well as lyrical pieces like "Banyan Shadows over the Pearl River" and "Thoughts of Pines." Whether in composition, conception, or brushwork and ink usage, his works are both bold and restrained, and within their elegance lies a sense of strength. As the saying goes: "The brush is like a dragon, the ink like clouds, soaring and dancing to fill the universe."

What is even more remarkable is that Chen Wei is not only a painter but also a distinguished engineer in atomic and optical engineering. He has won the National Science and Technology Progress Third Prize.

In recent years, Chen Wei has been transferred to the Beijing Institute of Arts and Crafts, which has given him more time to engage in poetry and painting creation. We wish him the same level of success in his poetry and painting creations as he has achieved in the field of science.

　　诗情画意总有缘
    增祥
    诗为画魂，画为诗情，这是中年画家陈维的创作特色之一。他作画或先诗后画，或画后题诗，十分注重情景交融，诗画结合。我们从他最近在中国美术馆举行的诗画展，就可领略到他在这方面的造诣，以及他对诗画艺术那种孜孜不倦的探索精神。
    陈维１９３８年生于广东普宁南山，自幼酷爱诗画。数十年来，他遍游祖国的名川大山，以造化为师，同时又潜心学习传统艺术的精华，虚心向老一辈艺术家求教，通过数以万计的画稿不断锤炼自己的功力，创作了１０００余幅作品。其中既有《长江纵览》、《北京十六景》和《三山五岳》等壮美的长卷巨构，也有《珠江榕荫》、《思松图》等清新秀丽的抒情之作，不论构图立意或用笔用墨，使人看上去既奔放粗犷又含蓄凝重，在潇洒之中又有刚劲之美。正是：“笔如长龙墨似云，飞腾飘舞满乾坤。”
    更为难得的是，陈维既是一位画家，又是一位卓有成就的原子和光学工程师。他荣获过国家科研三等奖。
    近年陈维调到北京工艺美术研究所，使他有更多的时间进行诗画创作。祝愿他像在科学方面的贡献一样，在诗画艺术创作上也能取得更大成就。
