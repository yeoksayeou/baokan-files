Individual industrial and commercial households exceed 14 million
	Production scale expands, new industries continuously explored

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on March 3, the latest statistics from the Individual and Private Economy Division of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce show that the development speed of individual economy in China has shifted from the previous years' exponential growth to sustained and stable growth. By the end of 1988, the number of individual industrial and commercial households in urban and rural areas nationwide reached 14,527,000, an increase of 5.84% compared to the end of 1987. The number of employees reached 23,049,000, an increase of 6.79%. The total business revenue for individual industrial and commercial households in urban and rural areas for the year was 128.8 billion yuan, a 24% increase over the previous year.

	It is reported that in the past few years, nearly 60% of individual industrial and commercial households were engaged in commerce, which has now decreased to below 50%, while industries, transportation, and construction have seen relatively rapid development. In 1988, the output value of individual industries reached 51.5 billion yuan, a 68% increase over the previous year.

	The trend of expanding the production scale of individual industrial and commercial households is also evident. Since the State Council issued the "Provisional Regulations on Private Enterprises" in July of last year, excluding the provinces of Shanxi and Heilongjiang, a total of 40,640 private enterprises have been registered nationwide, with 723,900 employees, averaging 17.8 employees per enterprise. Currently, the registration work is still ongoing. According to a survey, there are approximately 225,000 private enterprises nationwide with 8 or more employees.

	What is particularly worth mentioning is that individual industrial and commercial households have made new breakthroughs in their business sectors, with new industries such as technology development, consulting services, calligraphy, art decoration, advertising design, foreign language translation, pawnbroking, and auctions emerging. Many individual households and private enterprises have entered the international market with their products.

　　个体工商户逾一千四百万
    生产规模扩大不断开拓新行业
    据新华社北京３月３日电  （记者陈芸）国家工商行政管理局个体、私营经济司的最新统计显示，我国个体经济的发展速度，已由前几年的成倍增长转为持续稳定增长。到１９８８年底，全国城乡个体工商业达１４５２．７万户，比１９８７年底增加５．８４％，从业人员２３０４．９万人，增加６．７９％，城乡个体工商业全年营业额为１２８８亿元，比上年增长２４％。
    据介绍，前几年个体工商户中从事商业的将近６０％，现已下降到５０％以下，而工业、运输、建筑业有了较快发展。１９８８年个体工业的产值达５１５亿元，比去年增长６８％。
    个体工商户的生产规模不断扩大，也是一个趋势。自去年７月国务院颁发了《私营企业暂行条例》以来，除山西、黑龙江两省外，全国已有４０６４０户私营企业进行了注册登记，从业人员７２．３９万人，平均每户雇工１７．８人。目前登记工作仍在继续进行，据调查，全国雇工８人以上的私营企业户数约有２２．５万多户。
    尤其可喜的是，个体工商户在经营行业上有了新的开拓，出现了科技开发、咨询服务、书画、美术装璜、广告设计、外文翻译、典当、拍卖等新行业。许多个体户和私营企业的产品打入了国际市场。
