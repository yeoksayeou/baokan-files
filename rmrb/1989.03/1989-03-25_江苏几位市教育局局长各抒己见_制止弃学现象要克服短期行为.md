With the help of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Commission's Basic Education Bureau, the reporter held a discussion with several municipal education bureau directors and asked for their views on the "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading."

Two "Theories of the Uselessness of Reading" Have Differences and Connections

Zhōu Rǔlín (Director of the Xuzhou Municipal Education Bureau): I feel that the term "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" is not quite appropriate. The "Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" from over a decade ago was a product of the ultra-left line, "the more knowledge, the more reactionary." This time, however, the country emphasizes the importance of education more than ever, but the students themselves or their parents think that reading is useless, and the criteria for usefulness or uselessness are measured by how much money one can earn, because educated people earn less money, so students become disillusioned and drop out.

The phenomenon of students in primary and secondary schools becoming disillusioned and dropping out is not only due to the imbalance of values but also due to the responsibility of the education department. First, students have too heavy a burden; a primary school student's bag weighs 4 kilograms, filled with various reference books, which makes primary school students lose interest in learning. Second, the quality of teachers has declined. Under the impact of the commercial tide, some spiritual engineers have twisted souls, diluted the sacred mission of being a teacher, simplified teaching methods, and discriminated against poor performers, causing poor performers to fall behind step by step, become discouraged, and eventually drop out.

Lǐ Yán (Director of the Nantong Municipal Education Bureau): In the past 10 years, we have cultivated many writers and artists, and we have also begun to cultivate entrepreneurs, but who can say how many educators we have cultivated?

In the past, people were too poor to afford education, but now, in some places, people are rich and do not want to study. In our city, there is a township with a billion yuan in output value, but ironically, the phenomenon of students dropping out of primary and secondary schools is serious there. The main industry there is embroidery processing. Young children with sharp eyes and quick hands are just right for the job. A parent of a dropout student bluntly told a teacher who came to persuade the student to return to school, "Teacher, don't bother persuading. Your monthly salary, my child can earn in a week." Upon closer examination, the "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" has some connection with the previous one: now, the parents of primary and secondary school students are almost all victims of that time, and their indulgence in their children also affects their correct education of their children. A parent of a primary school student is engaged in individual business, and this primary school student steals a lot of money from home and introduces his experience to his peers. At the gate of a primary school, there are often various cars dropping off students, sometimes even ambulances and police cars. Setting aside the issue of embezzlement, from an educational perspective, such pampering of children is also detrimental to their future success.

The State Needs to Adjust Policies, Individuals Need to Improve Awareness

Zhèng Wànzhōng (Director of the Yangzhou Municipal Education Bureau): Rural students often drop out during the winter vacation rather than the summer vacation. Why? At first, we were also puzzled, but later we found out that these students' relatives or neighbors who went out to work returned home for the New Year, bringing back both money and new toys, and after enthusiastically describing their experiences, many people followed suit and went out to seek their fortune. The phenomenon of dropping out exists in "four less, four more": less in primary school, more in middle school; less in cities, more in rural areas; less male students, more female students; less parents with high cultural level, more parents with low cultural level. Ancient people knew that "leaving a thousand pieces of gold to one's children is not as good as teaching them one classic," but some modern people are not as good as the ancients. Now, everyone says that enterprise contracting has induced short-term behavior, but in fact, many families and individuals also have more or less short-term behavior at present, and they may adopt a utilitarian attitude towards the nine-year compulsory education. The "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" is a concentrated reflection of this.

Wáng Bóxiáng (Director of the Yancheng Municipal Education Bureau): Is reading useful? Of course, it is! Not reading makes one an ignorant person. Living in the world, even if one is rich but ignorant, one's spirit will inevitably be empty. After watching a good movie or reading a good novel, one cannot understand its true meaning, which is sad! But why does the "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" appear? This is mainly due to the "brain-body inversion" in real life.

How to reverse the current situation, I have two sentences: the state needs to adjust policies, and the laborers should get more; individuals need to improve their awareness and look to the future.

The Educational Policy Needs to Be Clarified Urgently

Chén Tiānzhōng (Deputy Director of the Changzhou Municipal Education Bureau): Now, everyone vaguely talks about "fully implementing the Party's educational policy," but if one asks seriously, how is the current Party's educational policy expressed? There may be several "versions," and they all have their origins. How can this not cause confusion in primary and secondary education?!

Zhèng Wànzhōng: Although some teachers lament that "college graduates earn little money, and primary school students earn a lot," in fact, complaints are complaints, but the actual work is still not sloppy. I have been a teacher for many years. In my opinion, being a teacher has at least three advantages: first, life is stable and regular, second, there are winter and summer vacations, and third, as a class teacher, one does not have to give one's heart to the students, as long as one fulfills one's responsibilities, there will always be a group of students who will visit and greet you from time to time. Now, during festivals, those who come to my house to see me are still the students I taught in the past. This kind of feeling is something that money cannot buy.

Rejuvenating the economy relies on education, and rejuvenating education relies on teachers. In the 1950s and 1960s, many people who applied to normal schools had high intelligence and were only restricted from applying to other majors due to their background. In this sense, one should be grateful to the ultra-left line. The current situation, however, is a bit worrying. According to Nanjing Normal University, only 1/3 of the freshmen want to be teachers when they first enroll, and after four years of study, only 1/5 of the graduates want to be teachers before graduation.

### 江苏几位市教育局局长各抒己见  制止弃学现象要克服短期行为

专栏：我看“新的读书无用论”

　　江苏几位市教育局局长各抒己见        
    制止弃学现象要克服短期行为
    本报记者  龚永泉
    在江苏省教委普教局的帮助下，记者同几位市教育局长进行了座谈，请他们谈了对“新的读书无用论”的看法。
    　　　　两次“读书无用论”有区别又有联系
    周汝林（徐州市教育局局长）：我觉得“新的读书无用论”的提法不那么妥贴，十几年前的“读书无用论”是极左路线的产物，“知识越多越反动”；而这一次是国家比任何时候都强调教育的重要性，但受教育者本人或家长认为读书无用，有用或无用的尺度，又是以赚钱多少来度量的，因为读书人赚钱少，学生便厌学、弃学。
    造成中小学学生厌学弃学，除了价值观念失衡外，作为教育部门也有一定责任，一是学生负担过重，小学生的书包有４公斤重，各种各样的参考书，五花八门，使小学生丧失了学习的兴趣；二是教师质量有所下降，在商品经济大潮的冲击下，有的灵魂工程师的灵魂出现了扭曲，淡化了为人师表的神圣使命感，教育方法简单化，歧视差生，致使差生一步跟不上，就步步跟不上，一蹶不振，最后干脆弃学了事。
    李炎（南通市教育局局长）：这１０年我们造就了许多作家、艺术家，也开始造就企业家，但谁能说得出造就了多少教育家？
    过去是穷得读不起书，而现在一些地方是富了不愿读书。我市有个产值亿元乡，偏偏他那里中小学生弃学现象严重。当地主要从事刺绣加工，小小年纪眼尖手快，正好派上用场。一位流失生的家长直率地对前来动员学生上学的教师说：“先生，你就别动员了，你一个月的工资，我孩子一个星期就赚回来了”。细究起来，“新的读书无用论”同前一次还有渊源关系：现在中小学生的家长差不多都是那时的受害者，溺爱孩子也影响了他们对子女的正确教育。一个小学生的家长从事个体经营，这个小学生大把大把从家里偷钞票，还向小伙伴介绍经验。在一所小学校的门口，时有各种小汽车送学生上学，有时还有救护车和警车，撇开损公肥私不说，仅从教育角度看，如此娇惯孩子对孩子成才也是不利的。
    　　　　国家要调整政策，个人要提高认识
    郑万锺（扬州市教育局局长）：农村学生弃学往往不是在暑假而是在寒假，为什么？起初我们也很纳闷，后来才知道是这些学生一些外出挣钱的亲戚、邻居回来过年了，带回来的又是钞票又是新鲜玩意，再加上眉飞色舞一渲染，不少人就跟着闯荡去了。弃学情形存在“四少四多”：小学少，中学多；城市少，农村多；男生少，女生多；家长文化程度高的少，文化程度低的多。古人尚知“遗子千金不如教子一经”，今人有的反而不如古人。现在都说企业承包诱发了短期化行为，其实，目前相当多家庭和个人也或多或少有些短期化行为，对九年义务教育可能采取实用主义态度，“新的读书无用论”就是一个集中反映。
    王伯杏（盐城市教育局局长）：读书有没有用？当然有用！不读书就是一个无知的人，生活在世界上，腰缠万贯而胸无点墨，精神必然是空虚的。看了一部好电影，读了一部好小说，也不能理解其真谛，岂不悲哀！但为什么会出现“新的读书无用论”？这主要是现实生活中的“脑体倒挂”引起的。
    如何扭转目前的态势，我想了两句话：国家要调整政策，优劳多得；个人要提高认识，放眼未来。
    　　　　教育方针亟待明确
    陈天中（常州市教育局副局长）：现在都是笼统地说“全面贯彻党的教育方针”，如果顶真地问一下，现行党的教育方针如何表述？恐怕会有好几个“版本”，而且都有来头，这怎么能不使中小学教育出现混乱？！
    郑万锺：别看有的教师感叹“大学生赚小钱，小学生赚大钱”，其实发牢骚归发牢骚，实际工作还是不含糊的。我当过多年教师，依我看，当教师起码有三点好处：一是生活安定有规律，二是有个寒暑假，三是当班主任，不要说把心掏给学生，只要尽了责任，日后总会有一批学生不时去看望你，问候你。现在逢年过节，到我家看我的，还是当年教过的学生，这种感情是花多少钱也买不到的。
    振兴经济依靠教育，振兴教育依靠教师。五、六十年代报考师范的，有不少是智力较高、仅仅因出身原因被限制，难以报考其它专业。从这层意义上说，应感激极“左”路线。眼下的情况却有点令人担忧，据南京师范大学介绍，刚入学时新生愿当教师的只有１／３，学了４年，毕业前愿当教师的则成了１／５。
