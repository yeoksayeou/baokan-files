The Hainan Provincial People's Government has recently established the Overseas Investment Work Committee. This committee will provide "one-stop" services for attracting foreign investment and managing it after it has been attracted, aiming to encourage large-scale development of the province through foreign investment.

The Hainan Overseas Investment Work Committee has established the Overseas Investment Bureau, which is fully responsible for four areas of work: formulating policies and planning for attracting foreign investment; conducting scientific assessments of major foreign investment projects; approving major foreign investment projects; and coordinating the provincial government's efforts to attract foreign investment and providing supporting services for "three types of enterprises" (foreign-funded, Sino-foreign joint ventures, and Sino-foreign cooperative enterprises).

From January to February this year, the total investment amount for contracted projects in the province has already reached $68.64 million.
