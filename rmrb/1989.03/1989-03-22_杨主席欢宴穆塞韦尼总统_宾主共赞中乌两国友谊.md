Chairman Yang Hosts Banquet for President Museveni
Both Host and Guest Praise Sino-Ugandan Friendship

BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chairman Yang Shangkun hosted a banquet at the Great Hall of the People tonight to warmly welcome Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni on his official friendly visit to China.

In his speech, Chairman Yang Shangkun said that recently, the situation in Southern Africa has shown a new trend favorable to the liberation cause of the African people. This is the result of the long-term struggle of African countries and peoples with the support of the international community. We hope that all parties concerned will seriously implement the Southwest African peace agreement, so that the independence of Namibia can be smoothly realized, and the sovereignty and security of the countries in Southern Africa can be guaranteed, so as to promote the continued easing of the situation in the region.

Chairman Yang said that at present, many African countries are seriously reflecting on the path they have taken since independence and are actively seeking development strategies and economic models suitable for their national conditions. At the same time, people have also seen that the economic revival of African countries is increasingly constrained by the unreasonable old international economic order, and the increasingly prominent debt problem has become an obstacle to Africa's development and prosperity. He expressed that the Chinese government sympathizes with and is concerned about the deep worries of African countries over the debt issue. China supports the reasonable demands and unremitting efforts of African countries to solve this problem.

In his speech, Chairman Yang also warmly praised the long-standing close friendship between the peoples of China and Uganda.

President Museveni said in his speech that the Chinese people have always stood with the peoples of the Third World, especially the African peoples. We thank the Chinese people for their firm support for the efforts to eradicate colonialism and apartheid in South Africa and Namibia; we thank China for the continuous material and financial support it provides to the frontline states in their efforts to break free from the economic and military blockade of the South African racist regime.

Those attending the banquet included Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Zhu Lifan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gu Mu, and others.

President Museveni arrived in Beijing this afternoon at the invitation of Chairman Yang Shangkun for a five-day state visit. Minister of the Ministry of Materials Liu Suinian and others from the government escort team welcomed President Museveni and his wife at the airport.

BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Chairman Yang Shangkun met with Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, who was invited to visit China, at the Great Hall of the People today. Yang said that developing our country is the wish of the entire nation. No matter which party or ethnic group, we all have a common desire, which is to develop our country.

Chairman Yang said that in the past decade, our country has made great progress in development, but many new problems and some new difficulties have also arisen. The ongoing National People's Congress is to mobilize the strength of the entire nation to overcome difficulties. Through the discussion of the representatives of the National People's Congress, solutions to the problems will be found. We have the confidence to overcome difficulties.

Before the meeting, Chairman Yang Shangkun held a ceremony at the East Gate Square of the Great Hall of the People to warmly welcome President Museveni.
