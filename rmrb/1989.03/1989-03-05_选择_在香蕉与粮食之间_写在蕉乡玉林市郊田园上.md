In Guangxi, when people mention bananas, they think of Yulin City; when they mention Yulin City, they think of bananas. Bananas and Yulin are inseparable.

In the early spring of the Year of the Snake, when the reporter arrived in the famous banana town of Yulin City, there was little talk about the praise of bananas. Instead, a different scene unfolded: retreating from banana cultivation to grain farming.

In Guishan Village, Chengbei Township, this is the village in Yulin City where bananas were first planted the most and the best. Right next to the banana fields that had just been harvested, village secretary Wen Puji vividly recounted to the reporter the rise and fall of bananas: In the early days of the founding of the nation, bananas were planted in large areas here; in the 1970s, some farmers, despite the risk of being "cut off" and the pain, continued to plant bananas; even in recent years, the 3,000 mu of arable land in Guishan Village was almost entirely covered by banana groves. But this year, villagers who had become rich by planting bananas decided: to convert half of the banana fields back into rice paddies. This change was not due to administrative orders, but mainly driven by the invisible hand—the law of value.

Chengbei Township Party Secretary Zhao Zikun said that a few years ago, the market price ratio of bananas to grains was 1:1. One mu of rice could produce 650 jin of rice, equivalent to about 450 jin of rice, while one mu of bananas could produce 2,000 jin. Compared to grains, planting bananas was much more profitable. Practical farmers naturally chose to plant bananas. In 1986, the entire township's banana planting area reached 20,000 mu, more than double that of the previous year.

However, since last autumn and winter, the price of Yulin bananas has plummeted, while the price of grains has soared. The price ratio of bananas to grains changed from the previous 1:1 to 1:4. Coupled with poor sales and transportation difficulties, many banana farmers and merchants suffered losses. Compared to grains, planting grains seemed more profitable.

Practical farmers made new choices based on the new value orientation: retreat from banana cultivation to grain farming.

"The farmers have already taken action. Look over there—" Following the direction of the township party secretary's finger, one could see that a distant banana grove had been cut down, and the land had been plowed.

The government did not passively stand by and let things take their course regarding farmers' planting of bananas and grains. A few years ago, due to the overdevelopment of bananas and the concentration of market supply, which caused transportation and sales channels to be blocked, the municipal and township governments had worked hard to promote transportation and sales. Recently, due to grain shortages and price increases, farmers' interest in cultivation shifted from bananas to grains. The municipal government took advantage of the situation and provided services, implementing a policy of encouragement and support for grain development. The city also dispatched hundreds of cadres, carrying their bedding, to live in various village committees...

Despite this, farmers in the banana-growing areas of Yulin City do not plan to convert all their banana fields into grain fields. On this point, the middle-aged farmer Wen Cheng's idea is: to change 3 mu of the original 5 mu of contracted land from bananas to grains, leaving 2 mu for bananas, and to cultivate both meticulously to achieve a bumper harvest of both bananas and grains.

Various pieces of information from the fields have given Zhang Shicai, deputy director of the Yulin City Government Office, who has dealt with farmers for more than 30 years, this feeling: Many farmers and grassroots cadres have learned to think and know how to choose—this is the hope in the fields.

### 选择——在香蕉与粮食之间——写在蕉乡玉林市郊田园上

　　选择——在香蕉与粮食之间
    ——写在蕉乡玉林市郊田园上
    本报记者  郑盛丰
    在广西，一提到香蕉，人们就会想到玉林市；一提到玉林市，也会想到香蕉。香蕉与玉林，已难解难分。
    蛇年初春，记者来到著名蕉乡玉林市时，却很少听到人们对香蕉的赞美。随处可见的是另一番景象：退蕉种粮。
    城北乡谷山村，这是玉林市种蕉最早最多也最好的一个村。就在刚刚收获过的蕉园旁，村支书文丕嘉有声有色地向记者叙说一部香蕉的兴衰史：建国初期，这里就成片种蕉；７０年代，仍有一些农民冒着被“割尾巴”的痛楚和风险，继续种蕉；乃至新近几年，谷山村的３０００亩耕地几乎全部被蕉林覆盖。但今年，靠种蕉致富的村民们决定：把一半蕉园复变稻田。这种变化，不是迫于行政命令，主要推动力来自那只看不见的手——价值规律。
    城北乡乡长赵子坤说，前几年，市场上蕉粮比价是１公斤香蕉可换１公斤大米。一亩地种水稻年产稻谷６５０公斤，折大米约４５０公斤，而种蕉一年可产２０００公斤。蕉粮相较，种蕉远胜于种粮。务实的农民自然选择种蕉。１９８６年，全乡种蕉面积达２万亩，超出上年两倍。
    然而，去年秋冬以来，玉林香蕉价格大跌，粮食价格则猛涨。蕉粮比价由往年的１∶１变成１∶４，再加上销路不畅，运力困难，不少蕉农蕉商出现亏损。蕉粮比较，种粮显得上算了。
    务实的农民又根据新的价值取向进行新的选择：退蕉种粮。
    “农民已经付诸行动了。你看——”顺着乡长手指的方向可以看到，远处一片蕉林已被砍倒，土地被犁翻过来。
    政府对农民植蕉种粮，当然不是消极地袖手旁观听任自流。前几年，由于香蕉发展过猛、上市太集中造成运销渠道不畅时，市乡政府曾花大力气四出联系促运促销。近期由于粮食紧缺粮价上涨，农民耕种兴趣由蕉转粮，市政府又因势利导提供服务，对发展粮食实行鼓励扶持的倾斜政策。市里还选派数百名干部，打起铺盖卷分别住到各村委会去……
    尽管如此，玉林市蕉区的农民并不打算把蕉园全都改种粮食。关于这一点，中年农民文成的想法是：原先全部种蕉的５亩责任田改种粮３亩，留蕉２亩，分别精耕细作，以期蕉粮互补，共夺丰收。
    来自田园的种种信息，使与农民打了３０多年交道的玉林市政府办公室副主任赵世材获得这种感受：许多农民和基层干部，已学会思考，懂得选择了——这正是田野上的希望所在。
