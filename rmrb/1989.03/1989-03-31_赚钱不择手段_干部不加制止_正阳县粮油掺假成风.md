	Editor's Note: "Food is the primary need of the people," how can grain and oil be adulterated! This article exposes the situation of adulteration in grain and oil in Zhengyang County and its surrounding areas in Henan Province, which is shocking. Is such a situation also present in other places? This needs to be thoroughly investigated. How to crack down on the trend of adulteration also needs to be seriously studied.

	In recent years, the phenomenon of adulterating and selling grain and oil has emerged in Zhengyang County, Henan Province, and its surrounding areas, causing serious harm to the state and the people.

	In the summer of 1988, Zhengyang County Oil Factory purchased tens of thousands of kilograms of rapeseeds. When the oil was being pressed, the machine produced a lot of mud. It turned out that a large amount of sand and stones, similar in size, shape, and color to rapeseeds, had been mixed in.

	In November 1988, the unit where the author works purchased a batch of rice from Wangzhuang Village, Tongzhong Township, Zhengyang County. After cooking the rice, it was full of sand and could not be chewed, so it had to be fed to the chickens. It turned out that white sand powder had been mixed into the rice.

	In the autumn and winter of 1988, the grain departments across the county purchased peanuts with an average of 8% soil clumps. This means that 2.48 million kilograms of soil clumps were purchased in total. At a purchase price of 1.10 yuan per kilogram, the state alone lost 2.728 million yuan on this item.

	According to a comrade from Zhengyang County Grain Bureau, the oil yield of rapeseeds a few years ago was 33%, now it is 29%; the oil yield of sesame a few years ago was 47%, now it is at most 42%; the oil yield of peanuts a few years ago was 23%, now it is at most 17%.

	Currently, in some places, the activity of adulterating grain and oil is becoming more and more rampant. In the past, adulteration was limited to adding rice water to small mill sesame oil; now, adulteration has developed to sesame, rapeseeds, peanuts, rice, wheat, mung beans, corn, and other grains and oils. In the border area between Fuzhai Township, Zhengyang County, and Nan Yudian Township, Shennan County, there is a Wenshu River. A section of the river sand here is round and granular. Some people here specialize in sifting sand, some color the river sand according to the color of the adulterated grain and oil varieties; others specialize in purchasing and selling classified river sand.

	Why has the adulteration of grain and oil become so rampant? The main reason is that unscrupulous merchants adulterate in large quantities, and the relevant departments are powerless to intervene and handle it poorly. Currently, individual purchasers in remote villages are scattered, and commercial and industrial management personnel are overwhelmed and cannot investigate thoroughly. Occasionally, a few people are caught, but they are only fined.

	Some purchasing units do not distinguish between good and bad grain and oil, and uniformly deduct weight and price. Farmers thus think that "adulteration is profitable, and not adulterating is a loss." Currently, grain and oil supply and marketing departments are generally contracted to teams and individuals, with losses borne by themselves and profits shared. In order to improve economic benefits, some purchasing personnel deduct impurities, moisture, weight, and price when purchasing grain and oil, causing many farmers who sell high-quality grain and oil to suffer losses. Some people start adulterating after suffering losses.

	Some village cadres turn a blind eye and deaf ear to farmers adulterating grain. A village cadre saw a farmer adding sand to grain, and the village party secretary greeted them with a smile, neither criticizing nor stopping them. He said: "After all, these grains are sold to other places, so what's wrong with letting the masses earn a few more yuan to get rich early?"

	According to the author's understanding, the trend of adulterating grain and oil is not limited to one county or one place. It is suggested that the relevant departments take effective measures to rectify the grain and oil purchasing market and stop this trend.

    正阳县粮油掺假成风
    编者按：“民以食为天”，粮油岂容掺假！这篇稿件揭露的河南正阳县及附近地区在粮、油中掺假的情况，令人吃惊。类似情况在其他地方是否也存在呢？这需要很好地查一查。如何打击掺假歪风，也需要认真作一番研究。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    近几年，在河南省正阳县及附近地区出现了粮油掺假出售的情况，它给国家和人民造成了严重危害。
    １９８８年夏，河南省正阳县油厂收购了数万公斤油菜籽。榨油之时，机器一转，出了不少泥浆。原来里面掺了大量与油菜籽大小、形状、色泽相同的砂石。
    １９８８年１１月，笔者所在单位到正阳县同中乡汪庄村买来一批大米，做成饭后，满嘴河沙不能嚼咽，只好拿来喂鸡。原来大米掺入了不易发现的白色河沙粉末。
    １９８８年秋冬，全县粮食部门收购的花生平均含泥块８％，也就是说，共收购泥团２４８万公斤。每公斤收购价１．１０元，仅此一项国家就损失２７２．８万元。
    据正阳县粮食局一位同志介绍，油菜籽前几年出油率为３３％，现在是２９％；芝麻前些年的出油率是４７％，现在最高出４２％；花生前几年的出油率为２３％，现在顶多出１７％。
    目前在一些地方，往粮食和油料中掺假的活动愈演愈烈。过去掺假只限于往小磨香油里面兑米汤等；现在掺假已发展到芝麻、油菜籽、花生、大米、小麦、绿豆、玉米等。正阳县傅寨乡与汝南县南余店乡交界处有条文殊河，其中一段的河沙呈圆形颗粒状。在这里，有的人专门从事筛沙，有的根据兑假粮油品种的颜色，给不同颗粒的河沙着色；还有的专门收购、销售已分类的河沙。
    粮油掺假为何泛滥到如此程度？主要原因是，不法商贩大量掺假，有关部门鞭长莫及，处理不力。目前，偏远乡村的一些个体收购户，大都随掺随卖，趁夜运出。由于他们分布零散，工商管理人员力不从心，查不胜查。偶尔抓住一两人，也只是罚款了事。
    少数收购单位对粮食、油料，不分优劣，一律扣斤压价。农民由此认为“掺假占便宜，不掺假吃亏”。目前，粮油供销部门普遍承包到组、到人，亏损自负，盈余分成。为了提高经济效益，一些收购人员收购粮食、油料时，扣杂，扣水分，压斤压价，使不少交售优质粮油的农民吃亏。有些人吃亏后也开始掺假。
    部分乡村干部对农民掺杂兑假，视而不见，听而不闻。一名村干部见到农民往粮食中掺沙时，村支书笑着跟他们打招呼，既不批评也不制止。他说：“反正这些粮食都卖到外地，让群众多收入几个钱早些致富有啥不好？”
    据笔者了解，粮油掺假风并非一县一地，建议有关部门采取有力措施，整顿粮油收购市场，刹住这股歪风。
