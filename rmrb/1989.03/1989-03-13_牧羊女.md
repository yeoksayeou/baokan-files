The Shepherdess
Painting by Li Xiu
Poem by Gu Liandi

The whip handle teases the red ball of the setting sun,
Following your shadow as it dances in the lake.
Your late return is with such grandeur,
Ahead, the clouds rumble with noise.

The whip cracks chase the waves of grass,
Once it starts, it never stops.
Fortunately, the sky has edges,
It guides it left and right.

Soon, the afterglow slips from the end of your braid,
You lead the flock into the village entrance.
Your lingering gaze glances back at the path,
The grassland reveals two scorching stars.

    牧羊女
    李秀画
    顾联第诗
    鞭鞘逗着夕阳的红绣球
    随你的影子在湖里游
    你晚归是这样大的气魄
    前面有喧响的云头
    鞭花追逐草浪
    一跑就不停休
    多亏天有边儿
    把它左兜右兜
    稍顷，余辉从你辫梢上滑走
    你把羊群顺进村口
    留恋的双眸瞥一眼来路
    草原显现两颗灼热的星斗
