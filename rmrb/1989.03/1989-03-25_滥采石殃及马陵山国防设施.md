For many years, Maoling Mountain in northern Jiangsu has been an ideal training ground for the northern Jiangsu troops to complete their training exercises. In recent years, however, local farmers and vagrants from Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui have been flocking to the area, setting up camps, digging pits, and mining stones. This has resulted in the severe damage to over 30 military facilities, causing significant difficulties for the troops' training.

At the beginning of this year, I accompanied the military leaders to inspect the Maoling Mountain defense facilities. I saw tractors and trucks lined up, transporting stones out of the mountain. Stone sheds, pits, and piles were scattered everywhere. The sound of stone blasting echoed all around. If this continues, the defense facilities that we have painstakingly built over the years will be reduced to nothing in just a few years.

　　滥采石殃及马陵山国防设施
    江苏北部的马陵山多年来是苏北部队完成训练课题的理想场地。近几年来，附近的农民及江苏、山东和安徽等地的游民不断涌来，在这里安营扎寨，挖坑采石，已使３０多处军事设施遭到严重破坏，给部队训练带来困难。
    今年初，我随部队首长察看马陵山国防设施时，看见拖拉机和汽车排成队向山外运石；采石棚、石坑和石堆星罗棋布；四周尽是开石的炮声。这样下去，我们苦心经营几十年的国防设施，几年内就会化为乌有。
