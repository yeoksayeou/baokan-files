Theft and smuggling of cultural relics are severe. Public security organs investigated 1,408 cases last year

    BEIJING, March 11 -- Reporter Mao Lei learned from the Ministry of Public Security that the public security organs of Beijing, Shanxi, Henan, Guangdong, and 20 other provinces, municipalities, and railway public security organs investigated 1,408 cases of smuggling, trafficking, stealing, and looting of cultural relics and ancient tombs last year. They seized 41,900 cultural relics and arrested 2,852 criminals.

    In the past two years, the situation of cultural relics being stolen in our country has been severe. In January of this year, five cases of cultural relics being stolen occurred in Hubei, Gansu, Sichuan, Henan, and Hebei provinces. According to statistics from the Ministry of Public Security, in 1987, there were 86 cases of cultural relics being stolen nationwide, with 850 cultural relics stolen, including 147 first, second, and third-level cultural relics. Last year, there were 80 cases of cultural relics being stolen, with 784 cultural relics stolen, including 423 first, second, and third-level cultural relics.

    The reporter learned that public security organs in various places have paid attention to organizing special forces to investigate major cases of stealing, smuggling, and trafficking of cultural relics, implementing case-by-case investigations, and investigating to the end.

    A large number of cultural relics being stolen and smuggled have exposed a series of problems. First, the leadership of cultural relics protection departments is complacent, lacks a sense of responsibility, and some are seriously derelict in their duties. The management system for cultural relics is chaotic, and there are rules that are not followed. Secondly, the security organizations are not sound, the number of security personnel is small, and the technical prevention facilities are poor.

　　文物被盗走私严重
    公安机关去年查获案件１４０８起
    本报北京３月１１日讯  记者毛磊从公安部获悉：北京、山西、河南、广东等２３个省、市和铁路公安机关，去年共查获走私、倒卖、盗窃文物和盗掘古墓案件１４０８起，缴获各类文物４．１９万余件，抓获犯罪分子２８５２人。
    近两年我国文物被盗情况严重，今年１月份，湖北、甘肃、四川、河南、河北五省接连发生５起文物被盗案件。据公安部统计，１９８７年全国发生文物被盗案件８６起，被盗文物８５０件，其中一、二、三级文物１４７件；去年发生文物被盗案８０起，被盗文物７８４件，其中一、二、三级文物４２３件。
    记者了解到，各地公安机关对盗窃、走私、倒卖文物的重大案件注意组织专门力量，实行专案专办，一查到底。
    大量文物被盗、走私，暴露出一系列问题，首先是文物保护部门领导思想麻痹，缺乏责任心，有的严重失职，文物管理制度混乱，有章不循；其次，是保卫机构不健全，保卫干部数量少，技术防范设施差等。
