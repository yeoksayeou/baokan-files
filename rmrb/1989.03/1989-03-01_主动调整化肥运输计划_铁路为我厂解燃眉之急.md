In December 1988, our factory's fertilizer inventory suddenly surged, causing storage to overflow and tying up 3.66 million yuan in funds, severely impacting normal production. Just as we were at our wits' end, Deputy Stationmaster Shi Shǒushèng and cargo transportation planner Wáng Zǐpíng from Yuánpíng Railway Station visited our factory to understand the situation and promised to help resolve the issue of fertilizer transportation as soon as possible.

The Taiyuan Railway Bureau and Yuánpíng Railway Station took measures to adjust the transportation plan and handle supplementary plans. In just over half a month, they arranged 87 freight cars for our factory, transporting over 15,000 tons of fertilizer to provinces such as Sichuan, Hubei, and Jiangsu, thus resolving our urgent problem.

　　主动调整化肥运输计划  铁路为我厂解燃眉之急
    １９８８年１２月，我厂库存化肥急骤增长，一时库储暴满，积压资金３６６万元，严重影响正常生产。正在我们焦虑万分的时候，原平火车站副站长石守胜和货运室计划员王子平来到我厂了解情况，表示尽快帮助解决化肥外运的问题。
    太原铁路分局和原平火车站，为此采取了调整运输计划和办理补充计划的办法，半个多月时间，为我厂调来８７个车皮，向四川、湖北、江苏等省运送化肥１．５万多吨，解了我厂的燃眉之急。山西原平化肥厂　王峰　温爱民
