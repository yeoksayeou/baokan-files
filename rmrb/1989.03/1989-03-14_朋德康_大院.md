The "Pende Kang"—Lhasa Social Welfare Institute, is located to the north of the Potala Palace. This place was once a quiet wilderness where countless generations of Buddhist devotees, holding prayer wheels, silently passed by. Year after year, they tread out the famous Lingkor Road. Later, someone started building, one house, two houses, three houses... and soon a small world of towering buildings appeared. Despite the surrounding new yellow residences, the small white buildings here are not inferior.

Lhasa has implemented martial law, and for those without proper documents, there are many inconveniences. The elderly widows and widowers at "Pende Kang" had never thought about this problem before. Now they can't go out to pray, and life has become boring. Who can they blame? White Ma, Gangzu, and others, while sunbathing, grumble: "Those people, why all the looting and vandalism? If there are problems, go to the government. Why burn other people's things?"

Fortunately, it is the peaceful "Pende Kang," and the sunlight is so gentle. Quzhuoma, Bendan, Gongjue... one by one, they stick their heads out and then, with shuffling steps, gather at the wall where they usually sunbathe.

Those who have seen the documentary about the 1959 suppression of the rebellion and democratic reform may remember that at that time, the dirty streets of Lhasa were filled with beggars with missing limbs. "Pende Kang" was a product of that era. Thirty years have passed, and eight of the original group of widows, widowers, and disabled people are still alive. Bendan, 77, has had a strange disease since childhood, with twisted limbs and can only walk crouching. He said he offended the gods and that if it weren't for the people's government, he wouldn't be so healthy. Gongma, a female merchant from Nixiu Linka, sits next to him, and the two have a good relationship. The director, Ajia Hongying, is very open-minded. She says that the elderly also need emotional support.

At 92 years old, Luozhuoma is the oldest here, having lived in "Pende Kang" for 25 years. In 1986, her son, Tudenqiren, who had been in exile and settled in Canada, came back to visit her. The old lady was overjoyed, never expecting that her son, who used to be a monk, had gotten married and had six children. Her son took her to the city to stay with relatives, planning to take her to settle abroad. But she stayed for two days, didn't get used to it, and insisted on returning to "Pende Kang." She said, "No place is as good as 'Pende Kang.'"

Indeed, this place is like a big family. Among the 39 welfare workers, there are widows, widowers, disabled people, and five orphans. Among the seven management personnel, there are doctors, nurses, nannies, and cooks. The orphans who grew up here have become officials, teachers, doctors, workers, and soldiers.

Director Hongying said, "The people's government is truly benevolent and virtuous."

### “朋德康”大院

　　“朋德康”大院
    本报记者  卢小飞
    “朋德康”——拉萨社会福利院，坐落在布达拉宫的北面。这里原本是一片寂静的原野，无数代手执转经筒的佛徒默默地从这里走过，年复一年，踏出了著名的林廓路。之后，不知谁起的头，一幢、二幢、三幢……，竟出现一片楼房林立的小世界。尽管周围有一片奶黄色新寓所，这里的小白楼也并不逊色。
    拉萨实行了戒严，对没有证件的人来说，确有许多不便。“朋德康”的孤寡老人们过去从没想到过这个问题，这下不能外出转经了，生活变得无聊起来。怨谁呢？白玛、刚祖他们边晒着太阳边念叨着：“这些人，搞什么打砸抢。有问题找政府么，烧人家东西干吗？”
    毕竟是宁静的“朋德康”，阳光如此温柔。卓玛、班登、公觉……一个个探出头来，又步履蹒跚地集中到他们经常晒太阳的墙根底下。
    看过反映１９５９年平叛和民主改革纪录片的人或许还记得，那时候，肮脏的拉萨街头，到处是肢体残缺的乞丐。“朋德康”是那个时代的产物。３０年过去了，当年那批孤寡残疾人还有８位在世。７７岁的班登自小得了一种奇怪的病，四肢扭曲，只能蹲着走路。他说自己冒犯了神灵，不是人民政府，他不会活得这么健康。来自尼秀林卡的女商人贡玛依在他旁边，两人感情相当不错。院长阿佳红英很开明，她说，老年人也需要情感。
    ９２岁的洛卓玛在这里年纪最大，在“朋德康”生活了２５年。１９８６年，流亡、定居在加拿大的儿子土登次仁回来看他，老阿妈乐坏了，没想到过去当喇嘛的儿子结了婚，还有了６个孩子。儿子把她接到城里的亲戚家，准备带她到国外定居。可她住了两天，不习惯，说什么也要回“朋德康”去。她说，哪儿也没有“朋德康”好。
    可不是，这儿像一个大家庭。３９个福利员里有孤寡老人、残疾人，还有５个孤儿。７个管理人员中，有医生护士，还有保姆和炊事员。从这长大的孤儿当上了干部、教师、医生、工人和解放军。
    院长红英说，人民政府是真正的行善积德。
