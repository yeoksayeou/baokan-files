Many people know that Mr. I.M. Pei designed the glass pyramid for the Louvre Museum in France, and his name has long been associated with the glass pyramid. The first phase of the extensive Louvre renovation project has been completed. On March 29, during a preview of the Grand Louvre organized by the French Ministry of Culture for journalists, we had the honor of meeting Mr. I.M. Pei.

That day, the bright spring sunlight filtered through the clear glass of the pyramid, filling the spacious and bright hall. Mr. I.M. Pei was surrounded by groups of journalists. After confirming that we had not mistaken our target, we pushed our way through the crowd to Mr. Pei. Faced with many journalists' requests for autographs, Mr. Pei quickly shook his hands, saying, "Too many, too many." We thought that Mr. Pei would surely accommodate the Chinese journalists, so we handed him a pen and a photograph of the glass pyramid. To our surprise, Mr. Pei happily said, "Ah! You are Chinese journalists," and turned to talk to us.

"Today's ceremony is so meaningful, Mr. Pei must be very moved..." the Chinese journalists asked.

Mr. Pei, speaking in a Southern Chinese accent, replied: "This project has been six years in the making. The first two years were very troublesome, but now the French people have accepted it, which is very gratifying."

Since the Paris newspapers published the model photo of the glass pyramid in January 1984, French media have not stopped reporting on the controversy. We understand Mr. Pei's feelings, remembering that he once said: "The design for the Louvre is the most important work of my life."

Perhaps Mr. Pei thought we might not fully understand the significance of these words, so he added: "We are foreigners. I am not only an American but also a Chinese. The French opposition is also reasonable. I think their opposition is not unreasonable."

"Did you anticipate this from the beginning?"

"I thought about it. At first, there were not many supporters, but gradually, more and more people supported it." For a unique and creative thing, it is often not accepted by everyone at the beginning. Mr. Pei's remarks revealed a process of people's understanding.

The journalists around us were getting impatient. We were afraid of missing the opportunity to get an autograph, so we handed the pen to Mr. Pei. He wrote "I.M. Pei" in large, neat Chinese characters on the back of the photo, and then signed in English.

	March 29, the Louvre Museum in France reopened to the public. The renovated Louvre, with the glass pyramid designed by the Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei as the reception hall, covers an area of 47,000 square meters.

　　卢浮宫里幸会贝聿铭
    本报记者  张启华
    许多人都知道贝聿铭先生为法国的卢浮宫设计了玻璃金字塔，贝聿铭的名字早已同玻璃金字塔连在一起了。浩繁的卢浮宫改建工程第一期已经竣工。３月２９日，在法国文化部邀请记者参观大卢浮宫预展时，我们荣幸地见到了贝聿铭老先生。
    这天，明媚的春光透过净明的金字塔玻璃洒满大厅，在宽敞明亮的大厅中，贝聿铭先生被一群群记者紧紧包围着。当我们认定没有看错对象之后，便挤进人群，闯到贝聿铭先生跟前。面对许多记者的签名要求，贝先生连忙摇手说，“太多了，太多了。”我们心想，贝先生一定会照顾中国记者的，就把笔和玻璃金字塔的照片送到贝先生面前。没想到，贝聿铭先生高兴地说，“啊！你们是中国记者”，转身和我们谈开了。
    “今天的典礼多么有意义，贝先生的心情一定很不平静……”在场的中国记者问。
    贝先生操着南方口音的国语回答说：“这个工程六个年头过去了，头两年非常麻烦，现在法国人接受了，这是令人愉快的。”
    从１９８４年１月巴黎报纸刊登玻璃金字塔的模型照片后，法国报刊一直没有停止对这场争论的报道。我们很理解贝老先生的心情，记得他曾这样说：“为卢浮宫所作的设计，是我一生中最重要的。”
    也许贝聿铭先生以为我们不太懂这些话的含义，他接着说：“我们是外国人，我非但是美国人，也是中国人。法国人反对也是有道理的。我觉得他们的反对不是不讲道理的。”
    “那么你一开始就预想到这点了吗？”
    “我想到了。起先支持者不太多，慢慢地支持的人越来越多了。”对一种独特的、创造性的事物，开始往往不为大家所接受，贝先生这一席话，道出了人们认识的一个过程。
    旁边的记者们有些焦急了，我们怕失去签名的机会，便把笔送到贝先生的手里。他在照片背面，工整有力地用中文写上了“贝聿铭”三个大字，接着，又用英文签了名。
