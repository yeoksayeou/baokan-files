Two armed terrorists hijacked a Hungarian plane this morning at the Ruzyně Airport in Prague and flew it to Frankfurt, the Federal Republic of Germany.

According to the CTK news agency, the two terrorists used hostages as cover to force their way onto a Tupolev Tu-154 plane of the Hungarian Airlines that was preparing to fly to Amsterdam. After negotiations, the plane, which had 10 passengers and crew members on board, took off from Ruzyně Airport at 11:32 a.m. and landed at Frankfurt Airport at 12:30 p.m. after releasing all the women and children.

The relevant authorities of Czechoslovakia demanded the handover of the two terrorists.
