Delegates attending the second session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) began group discussions on March 20. The most heated topic of discussion was how the CPPCC can better leverage its "talent pool" advantage to participate in politics and policy-making, and to promote the development of China's political, economic reforms, and modernization.

In the meeting rooms of five hotels and guesthouses in Beijing—Jingfeng, Youyi, Guoyi, Xiangshan, and Yuanwanglou—delegates spoke freely, sharing their views on the work of the CPPCC over the past year and giving high praise. In the Minjindang group, delegates such as Ge Zhicheng, Liu Xilin, and Liu Zhenhua believed that the work of the CPPCC has become more active, more solid, and more innovative each year. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh CPPCC National Committee, which adopted the "Provisional Regulations on Political Consultation and Democratic Supervision of the CPPCC National Committee," was unanimously praised by the delegates. Kan Fuyi, a delegate from Hong Kong, believed that this regulation is an "important step in China's democratic construction."

Many delegates proposed that to truly achieve democratic supervision, the CPPCC delegates must first be informed, expand the scope of knowledge, and increase the transparency of various works. The government should not only report the content of decisions to the CPPCC but also provide the basis for decisions, realizing consultation before decision-making and supervision during work.

During the discussion, delegates generally proposed that CPPCC delegates should, on the one hand, frankly criticize the shortcomings in the country's political and social life, and on the other hand, use their wisdom to propose feasible solutions. Wei Minglun, a delegate from Sichuan, said that CPPCC delegates participating in politics and policy-making should not just discuss phenomena but should discuss the essence; not just discuss problems but also discuss solutions; not just discuss the past but also discuss development. Everyone should contribute ideas and solutions to build the country well, which is the purpose of policy-making. Writer Feng Jicai proposed that political consultation is not about coordinating emotions. There should be more solutions and fewer complaints; more rationality and fewer emotions; more exploration of the essence and less superficial display; more political perspective and less aimless outpouring, so that our CPPCC can truly play a role in the actual improvement of the country's politics and people's lives. Xie Jin proposed that CPPCC delegates should discuss issues more from a macro and policy perspective in CPPCC meetings, and less about specific trivial matters. They should elevate various problems and phenomena to a macro level for recognition, gather wisdom, and discuss solutions to problems. Wu Cangping said that the work of the CPPCC and democratic supervision should also increase transparency.

Regarding proposals, delegates had many opinions. They hope that relevant departments will truly pay attention to the delegates' suggestions and not just be satisfied with the number of responses. Deng Xiancheng, a Central Committee member of the China National Democratic Construction Association, said that the response rate for CPPCC delegates' proposals is very high, but only 28% are truly adopted. Many responses are vague, with too many "under study" types of replies. Some problems that are not difficult to solve are proposed every year, but they are not solved. Academician Zhu Chenglu of the Chinese Academy of Sciences criticized some government departments for not paying enough attention to delegates' proposals in his speech.

　　政协委员希望政府向政协提供决策依据        
    协商在决策前监督在工作中
    据新华社北京３月２１日电  出席全国政协七届二次会议的委员从２０日开始进行分组讨论。委员们议论最热烈的话题是：在治理整顿和深化改革的新形势下，政协如何更好地发挥“人才库”的优势，参政议政，推动我国政治、经济体制改革和现代化建设事业的发展。
    在京丰、友谊、国谊、香山、远望楼五个饭店、宾馆的会议室里，委员们畅所欲言，对人民政协一年来的工作各抒己见，给予高度评价。在民进组，葛志成、刘西林、刘震华等委员认为，政协的工作一年比一年活跃，一年比一年扎实，一年比一年有所开拓。七届政协常委会第４次会议通过的《政协全国委员会关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定》，受到委员们的一致赞扬。来自香港的简福饴委员认为，政协的这个规定是“中国民主建设中迈出的重要一步”。
    许多委员提出，为了真正实现民主监督，必须首先使政协委员了解情况，扩大知情范围，提高各项工作的透明度，政府向政协不仅要通报决策内容，而且要提供决策依据、实现协商在决策之前，监督在工作之中。
    在讨论中，委员们普遍提出：政协委员一方面要对国家政治和社会生活的弊端提出直言不讳的批评，一方面要发挥智慧，提出解决问题的可行性建议。来自四川的魏明伦委员说，政协委员参政议政，不能光议现象，更要议本质；不仅要议问题，更要议办法；不仅议过去，更要议发展。大家出主意，想办法，把国家建设好，才是议政的目的。作家冯骥才委员提出，政治协商不是情绪协调。要多一点办法，少一点牢骚；多一点理性，少一点感情；多一点本质探求，少一点现象铺张；多一点政治视角，少一点漫无边际的挥洒，以使我们的政协真正能在国家政治和人民生活的实际改善中发挥作用。谢晋委员提出，政协委员在政协会议上，应多从宏观上、政策上谈论问题，少谈一些具体的琐碎的事情，应把各种问题、现象提到宏观高度来认识，要集思广益，探讨解决问题的办法。邬沧萍委员说，政协的工作和民主监督也应该增加透明度。
    对于提案，委员们意见较多，他们希望有关部门真正重视委员的建议，不要仅仅满足于办复了多少件。民革中央委员邓先诚委员说，政协委员提案的办复率很高，但真正采纳的只有２８％，很多答复含糊其词，“正在研究”之类的回复太多。有些并非难解决的问题，每年都有提案，但就是解决不了。中国科学院学部委员邹承鲁委员在发言中批评政府一些部门对委员提案不够重视。
