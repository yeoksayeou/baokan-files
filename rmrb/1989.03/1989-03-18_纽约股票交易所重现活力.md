After more than a year since the New York stock market crash, the reporter recently returned to the New York Stock Exchange. On the 17th floor of the building, the original trading hall of about 2,800 square meters has been expanded to over 3,400 square meters. In the four stock rooms and 16 trading booths, the atmosphere is bustling, and the panic seen during the market crash is nowhere to be found.

In front of the trading desks, people are busy conducting transactions, representing buyers and sellers of stocks, making gestures, and shouting out prices. After several rounds of negotiation, when both parties agree on the best price, the transaction is completed. At this point, the reporter writes down the agreed price on a computer card and places it in the automatic recorder on the trading desk. The latest price of the stock immediately appears on the television screen above the trading desk. This price is then transmitted through the telecommunications network to major stock exchanges around the world.

Currently, about 1,600 large companies from the United States and other countries have 2,400 types of stocks listed on this world financial center. The daily stock trading volume is around 160 million shares, approaching the average daily trading volume of 189 million shares in 1987. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has reached over 2,200 points, far exceeding the 1,738 points on the day of the market crash.

Richard Torrenzano, the vice president in charge of news liaison, proudly told the reporter that over the past 200 years, the New York Stock Exchange has grown from a small financial market in one country into an international financial center, making significant contributions to the development of the American economy. In the 19th century, the United States used the exchange to raise huge sums of money for building railways, opening canals, and mining. In recent decades, it has raised even more substantial funds for various modern and high-tech industries.

Like other stock exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange attracts people to buy stocks, invest, and speculate. Curiously, I asked Mr. Torrenzano: Doesn't the exchange take measures to encourage investment and restrict speculation? He clearly replied: For the development of the exchange, both investment and speculation are needed. Investment helps in raising funds, while speculation can activate the market.

Accompanying personnel introduced that over the past year, to prevent another stock market crash, the New York Stock Exchange has made significant improvements to its equipment. Now, the internal electronic computers can handle up to 600 million transactions per day, three times the capacity in 1987. At the same time, the exchange has taken a series of measures to control stock market crashes.

We were talking enthusiastically when suddenly the bell rang, and the electronic clock showed 3:59:58 PM, indicating that the market would close at 4:00 PM. People left behind piles of paper scraps and walked out of the hall. The reporter had to say goodbye to the accompanying news officer, Ms. Catherine, hoping to have another opportunity to visit and learn about the further development of the exchange.

### 纽约股票交易所重现活力

　　纽约股票交易所重现活力
    本报记者  刘开宸
    在纽约股市暴跌１年多以后，记者最近又来到了纽约股票交易所。在１７层大楼的底层，原来约２８００平方米的交易大厅，扩大到３４００多平方米。在４个股票室、１６个交易亭里，人声鼎沸，熙熙攘攘，这里已看不到股市暴跌时那种惶恐气氛。
    交易台前，人们在忙碌地进行交易，分别代表买、卖股票的顾客，做着手势，大声喊价。经过几次讨价还价，在双方都认为得到最佳价格后，即同意成交。这时，报告员就把买卖双方谈妥的价格，写在一张电脑卡片上，放入交易台上的自动记录器里，交易台上方的电视屏幕立即出现该种股票的最新价格。此价格又立即通过电讯网络传到世界各大股票交易所。
    目前，大约有１６００家美国和其它国家大公司的２４００种股票在这个世界金融中心上市。每天的股票交易量有１．６亿股左右，接近１９８７年每日平均的股票交易量１．８９亿股。道·琼斯工业股票平均指数达２２００点以上，远远超过了股市暴跌那天的１７３８点。
    交易所负责新闻联络的副总裁理查德·托伦扎诺自豪地对记者说，近２００年来，纽约股票交易所从一个国家的小金融市场发展成为一个国际性的大金融中心，为美国的经济发展做出了重要贡献。１９世纪，美国通过交易所为建设铁路、开辟运河、开采矿产等筹集了巨额资金，近几十年，它又为各种现代工业、高科技工业筹集的资金更为可观。
    纽约股票交易所和其它股票交易所一样，吸引着人们来购买股票，进行投资，也进行投机。我好奇地问托伦扎诺先生：难道交易所不采取措施鼓励投资、限制投机吗？他明确地回答：对交易所的发展来说，人们来投资和投机都是需要的。投资便于筹集资金，投机则可以活跃市场。
    据陪同人员介绍，一年多来，为防止再次出现股市暴跌，纽约股票交易所大规模地改进了设备。现在，所内电子计算机每天交易的运算量，可达６亿股，是１９８７年运算能力的３倍。同时，交易所又采取了一系列措施，制约股票暴跌。
    我们正谈得起劲，突然当、当、当，交易大厅里响起了电钟音，电子时钟上显示下午３时５９分５８秒，预告下午４时就要收盘，人们丢下满地的纸屑，走出大厅。记者只好向陪同的新闻官凯瑟琳女士告别，希望以后有机会再来采访，了解交易所的进一步发展。
