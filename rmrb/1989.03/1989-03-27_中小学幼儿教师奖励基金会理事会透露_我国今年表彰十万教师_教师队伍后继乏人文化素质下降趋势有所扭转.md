Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 27th.

The Executive Board of the China Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Award Foundation revealed that this year, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 5th anniversary of the establishment of Teachers' Day, a group of outstanding teachers and educators who have made remarkable achievements in educational work will be honored.

The meeting disclosed: Some worrying trends in the construction of the primary and secondary school teacher workforce in our country have been reversed in recent years. The trend of a shortage of successors and declining cultural quality in the teacher workforce has changed. The enrollment of normal schools has increased significantly, currently accounting for about 35% of the total enrollment of colleges and universities nationwide. By 1990, the number of graduates from normal universities will reach more than 190,000, and the number of graduates from normal colleges will reach more than 230,000. Nationwide, more than 400,000 undergraduate and college graduates will be added to the primary and secondary school teacher workforce each year, basically meeting the needs of the development of the education cause. Currently, more than 200,000 teachers nationwide obtain qualified certificates each year through self-study, radio and television universities, adult education colleges, and correspondence courses.

Wang Zheng, Vice Chairman of the State and Chairman of the China Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Award Foundation, emphasized in his speech that the current focus of the Foundation's work is to actively open up channels and mobilize various sectors of society to raise funds for the award. The funds raised will be used for one purpose only: to reward teachers, and these funds will not be used for other activities.

Li Tieying, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission, said at the meeting that the establishment of the China Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Award Foundation will promote the whole society to respect teachers and education, which is a good thing, and it should be carried out for a long time.

Liu Bin, Vice Minister of the State Education Commission and Secretary-General of the Foundation, reported to the Executive Board on the Foundation's work over the past year.

The reporter learned from the meeting that this year, on Teachers' Day, local teachers' foundations will all carry out award activities, and the number of teachers to be rewarded is expected to exceed 100,000. Among them, 1,500 people will be awarded the title of National Labor Model in the Education System, enjoying the treatment of ministerial-level labor models, and will be awarded the "People's Teacher Medal" and corresponding certificates. Other awardees will be awarded the "National Excellent Teacher Medal," "National Excellent Educator Medal," and corresponding certificates. All excellent teachers and educators who are awarded will be given awards by the China Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Award Foundation.

It is understood that since the establishment of the China Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Award Foundation, it has received enthusiastic donations from various sectors of society and people from home and abroad, with a cumulative fund of 100 million yuan.

　　中小学幼儿教师奖励基金会理事会透露        
    我国今年表彰十万教师         
    教师队伍后继乏人文化素质下降趋势有所扭转
    本报北京３月２６日讯  记者魏玉凤报道：今天上午，国家副主席、中国中小学幼儿教师奖励基金会理事长王震在人民大会堂主持召开基金会第三次理事会。会议决定，今年国庆４０周年、教师节设立５周年之际，将表彰一批在教育工作中做出显著成绩的优秀教师和教育工作者。
    会议透露：我国中小学教师队伍建设中一些令人忧虑的趋势近几年已有所扭转，教师队伍后继乏人、文化素质下降的趋势已有改变，师范院校招生数量大幅度上升，目前已占全国高校招生总数的３５％左右；到１９９０年，师范本科毕业生将达到１９万人以上，师范专科毕业生将达到２３万多人，全国每年将有４０多万本、专科毕业生补充到中小学教师队伍中，基本上能适应教育事业发展的速度。全国目前每年有２０多万教师通过自学、电大、业大、函授等方式取得合格资格。
    王震在讲话中强调，当前基金会的工作重点是积极开辟渠道，动员社会各方面力量筹集奖励基金。筹集的资金只办一件事，就是用来奖励教师，不要用这些钱搞其他活动。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务委员兼国家教委主任李铁映在会上说，建立中小学幼儿教师奖励基金会将促进全社会尊师重教，是一件大好事，要把它长期坚持下去。
    国家教委副主任、基金会秘书长柳斌向理事会报告了基金会一年来的工作情况。
    记者从会上获悉，今年教师节各地教师基金会都将开展奖励活动，奖励教师的人数预计超过１０万人。其中１５００人授予全国教育系统劳动模范称号，享受部级劳动模范待遇，并向他们颁发“人民教师奖章”和相应的证书。其他受表彰人员颁发“全国优秀教师奖章”、“全国优秀教育工作者奖章”和相应的证书。凡受表彰的优秀教师和教育工作者由中国中小学幼儿教师奖励基金会发给奖金。
    据了解，自中小学幼儿教师奖励基金会成立以来，得到社会各界和国内外人士的热情捐助，累计基金已达１亿元。
