Title: Stability is the Foundation, Security is Paramount

	Stability is the foundation,
	Security is paramount.

	Hong Feng

	To write poetry is to grasp an elusive fate,
	Do not assume your fate is as solid as a rock.
	Sweat flows like a river,
	The river carries you away.

	If there truly is a master,
	I am willing to surrender my body.

	A grand building stands tall,
	In the shadow of the sun and thunder,
	Why bother to attack?
