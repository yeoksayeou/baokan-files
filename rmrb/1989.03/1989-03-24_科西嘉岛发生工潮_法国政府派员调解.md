Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 23rd. — Reporter Zhang Qihua reports: Yesterday, another group of employees in Corsica, France, joined the strike. The strikers clashed with the police, resulting in dozens of casualties and causing social and transportation chaos.

After the incident, Prime Minister Michel Rocard immediately called for negotiations to resolve the crisis and quickly restore order. Yesterday, the government cabinet discussed and decided to send mediators to resolve the conflicts between the government and the unions. According to reports, with the efforts of relevant parties, the blocked airports and ports were partially reopened yesterday, and some stranded tourists began to leave the island.

The cause of this serious strike wave in Corsica is the rise in prices, with workers demanding wage increases.

　　科西嘉岛发生工潮        
    法国政府派员调解
    本报巴黎３月２３日电  记者张启华报道：昨天，在法国科西嘉岛上又有一部分员工加入了罢工行列。罢工者与警方发生冲突，死伤数十人，导致社会、交通一片混乱。
    事发后，罗卡尔总理立即呼吁谈判解决危机，迅速恢复正常秩序。昨天政府内阁会议经过讨论决定，派出调解员去解决政府和工会之间的矛盾。据报道，在有关方面努力下，被封锁的机场、码头昨天部分开放，一些受困的游客陆续离开该岛。
    这次科西嘉岛出现的严重罢工浪潮的起因是物价上涨，工人要求提高工资。
