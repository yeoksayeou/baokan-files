High-Interest Fundraising is Unwise: Hebei Implements Restrictive Measures

	The People's Daily, Shijiazhuang, March 13th - Correspondent Yang Zhenwu reports: "Regarding enterprise fundraising, we must differentiate between situations, guide actively, neither allowing it to run wild nor blocking it entirely." Hebei Province Governor Yue Qifeng recently revealed to reporters that they have decided to strengthen the management of enterprise fundraising.

	This governor does not approve of some enterprises using high-interest rates to attract workers' funds. He said, "This not only increases the enterprise's production costs but also reduces the bank's funding sources. Some even expand the scale of fixed asset investments and consumption funds, which is not conducive to adjusting the industrial structure."

	It is understood that Hebei Province's measures to strengthen the management of enterprise fundraising mainly include: First, local branches of the People's Bank of China should manage the enterprise's fundraising in a compensated form according to the law, advocating for converting enterprise fundraising into savings deposits or enterprise loans; Second, regardless of the method used by enterprises to raise funds, they must strictly control fixed asset investments and not exceed the national plan; Third, enterprise fundraising should primarily collect workers' surplus funds, with interest rates comparable to the same level of bank savings deposits. It should not be forced, and it should not guarantee both interest and dividends; Fourth, according to the national industrial policy, fundraising for enterprises with poor performance and no prospects should be restricted.

	Yue Qifeng believes that solving the problems in enterprise fundraising requires specific analysis of specific situations, combining both guidance and restriction, and leading fundraising to become an organized and planned economic activity. This way, it can both play the role of the bank as the main channel and also help to gather the broad masses of workers' love for the factory, promoting production development.

　　高利集资不可取
    河北制定限制措施
    本报石家庄３月１３日电  记者杨振武报道：“对企业集资要区别情况，积极引导，既不能放任自流，也不能全部堵死。”河北省长岳岐峰日前向记者透露，他们已决定加强对企业集资的管理。
    这位省长不赞成一些企业用高利吸收职工资金的做法。他说，这样既增加企业生产成本，又减少了银行资金来源，有的还扩大了固定资产投资规模和消费基金，不利于产业结构的调整。
    据悉，河北省加强企业集资管理的措施主要有：一，各级人民银行要依法对企业有偿形式的集资进行管理，提倡把企业集资转为储蓄存款或转为对企业贷款；二，企业无论采取何种方式集资，都必须严格控制固定资产投资，不能突破国家下达的计划；三，企业集资要以筹集职工手头的余钱为主，比照银行同档次存款利率付息，不能摊派，不能保息、分红两头占；四，按照国家产业政策，对那些效益差又无转机的企业集资加以限制。
    岳岐峰认为，解决企业集资中的问题，关键是要具体情况具体分析，疏堵并举，把集资引导为有组织、有计划的经济活动。这样，既可发挥银行的主渠道作用，也有利于集聚广大职工的爱厂如家思想，促进生产的发展。
