Martial Arts Experts Gather in Beijing to Study Martial Arts Ranking Standards
	Our reporter in Beijing, March 11th: In the process of promoting martial arts worldwide, both domestic and international martial arts enthusiasts have proposed the need to establish martial arts rankings. The State Sports Commission's Martial Arts Institute has adopted this suggestion and recently invited influential martial arts experts from across the country to gather in Beijing for a special study.

	The martial arts experts analyzed the situation of ranking systems in foreign martial arts such as judo and taekwondo. They initially proposed that Chinese martial arts could be divided into two main categories: grades and ranks. This would facilitate the assessment of the proficiency of those practicing martial arts. The evaluation criteria would primarily focus on fist techniques, with equal emphasis on routines and combat skills. Additionally, theoretical knowledge would be assessed, and after comprehensive testing, the martial arts rank of the individual would be clearly determined.

　　武术家聚京研究武术等级标准
    本报北京３月１１日讯  在武术向世界推广中，国内外武术爱好者都提出制定武术等级的要求。国家体委武术院采纳了这个意见，最近已邀请全国有影响的武术家来京进行专门研究。
    武术家们分析了国外柔道、跆拳道设段位的情况，初步认为我国武术可分为级和乘两大类级别，这样便于衡量参加武术锻炼者的水准。其考评内容，以拳术为主，套路和技击并重，同时还要了解理论水平，经过综合测试后，明确其武术等级。　　　　　　　　　　（于鲁人）
