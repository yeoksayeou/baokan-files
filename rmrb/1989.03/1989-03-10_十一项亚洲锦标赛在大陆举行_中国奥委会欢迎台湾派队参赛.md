	Eleven Asian Championships to be Held on the Mainland
	Chinese Olympic Committee Welcomes Taiwan to Send Teams to Compete

	New China News Agency Beijing, March 9th: Today, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Olympic Committee, He Zhenliang, met with reporters from our agency and said: This year, eleven Asian Championships will be held on the mainland of China. We welcome teams from Taiwan to come to the mainland to compete.

	He Zhenliang said, in recent years, the sports circles and athletes on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have had more contact in international competitions and conferences. In 1988 alone, there were over 40 international competitions where athletes from both sides participated. However, up to now, these competitions have all been held in third-party locations. Next year, the 11th Asian Games will be held in Beijing. To allow athletes from various parts of Asia to familiarize themselves with the competition facilities and conditions of the Asian Games as early as possible, with the approval of relevant Asian sports organizations, we will host a series of Asian Championships. These championships are important preparations for the Asian Games next year for athletes from various parts of Asia and the host. We sincerely welcome sports teams from Taiwan to participate and will provide them with all necessary conveniences.

	When asked by the reporter about how to handle the naming issue for Taiwan's sports delegation, which is currently a major concern for the Taiwanese sports community, He Zhenliang said, the International Olympic Committee and international sports organizations have specific resolutions regarding the name, flag (emblem), and anthem of Chinese Taipei based on the "One China" principle. Under the strict adherence to these resolutions, some technical issues regarding participation can be resolved through consultation in the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences. He expressed his belief that, through the joint efforts of both sides, there will be new breakthroughs in sports exchanges between the two sides this year.

	He Zhenliang also told the reporter that, considering that the Taiwanese side has repeatedly expressed its intention to participate in relevant competitions, if due to procedural and operational reasons, registration is not completed on time, as long as it does not affect the overall organization of the competition, the organizers can make accommodations.

　　十一项亚洲锦标赛在大陆举行
    中国奥委会欢迎台湾派队参赛
    新华社北京３月９日电  中国奥委会副主席何振梁今天接见本社记者采访时说：今年在我国大陆将举办十一个项目的亚洲锦标赛，欢迎台湾地区派队来大陆参赛。
    何振梁说，近年来海峡两岸的体育界和运动员在国际比赛和国际会议中接触较多，仅１９８８年，两岸运动员同时参加的国际比赛就达４０多次。但迄今，这些比赛都是在第三地进行的。明年第十一届亚运会将在北京举行。为了使亚洲各地运动员尽早熟悉亚运会的比赛设施和条件，经有关亚洲体育组织批准，我们将举办一系列亚洲锦标赛。这些锦标赛对于亚洲各地的运动员和东道主来说，都是对明年亚运会的重要准备。我们真诚地欢迎台湾地区体育队前来参加，并将为他们提供各种方便。
    当记者问到将如何对待台湾体育界目前十分关注的来大陆参赛的名称问题时，何振梁说，国际奥委会和国际体育组织根据“一个中国”的原则对中国台北的名、旗（徽）、歌已有专门决议。在严格遵守这些决议的前提下，有关参赛的一些技术性问题，本着求同存异的精神，通过磋商是不难解决的。他表示相信，两岸之间的体育交往通过双方的共同努力今年将有新的突破。
    何振梁还告诉记者，鉴于台湾方面已多次表示前来参加有关各项比赛的意愿，如果由于程序和作业上的原因，未能按时报名，只要不影响整个比赛的组织工作，比赛的组织者可以给予通融。
