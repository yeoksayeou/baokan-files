	Mao Family Lane is located on the east side of Beijing Railway Station. It is a small alley about 70 meters long. The alley is densely packed with about 20 individual restaurants, filled with the aroma of food and the smell of cooking oil. Because "Mao Family Lane" shares the same name as the famous official residence in Xicheng District, people also call this area "Little Mao Family Lane."

	Just a few years ago, Mao Family Lane was a desolate place with toilets and residential buildings side by side. In just a few years, it has become a famous street of individual restaurants. Restaurants with unique names like "Xiang Zai Lai," "Ming Zhu," "Du Le," and "Si Xiang" attract hungry travelers from all directions. Thanks to individual restaurants like Mao Family Lane, out-of-town visitors no longer have to worry about finding a place to eat in Beijing.

	The prosperity of individual restaurants in Mao Family Lane is inseparable from the "pulling customers" girls. As soon as you enter the alley, two or three young women will immediately surround you, chattering non-stop about the advantages of their restaurant and persuading you to eat there. Some girls are even bold enough to approach you and pull your sleeve to invite you in.

	Once inside the restaurant, of course, you have to pay. If you try to escape, you might face ridicule or even insults. A customer from Heilongjiang was pulled into a restaurant and found the table greasy, so he tried to leave. However, a bold Anhui female employee grabbed him and wouldn't let go: "Why did you come into the store if you're not going to eat? Are you crazy or something?" He was forced to eat a bowl of "humiliated noodles."

	The personal dependency relationship between employers and employees, along with their shared financial interests, has led to intense competition between restaurants. Police materials indicate that fights frequently occur in "Mao Family Lane." The "pulling customers" girls will not hesitate to argue or even fight to attract customers. Shortly after the New Year, the owner of the "Jing Kui" restaurant fought over customers and beat an employee of the "Xin Xing" restaurant, causing him to have a bloody nose and mouth, requiring 10 stitches.

	One of the "pulling customers" girls frankly told the reporter, "If I don't pull customers, I won't be able to complete the tasks given by the boss. Not only will I get less pay, but I might also get scolded or beaten. For the money, I have to put my face on the line!"

	It is understood that Beijing has more than 8,500 individual restaurants, and the individual restaurants in Mao Family Lane are one of the more influential groups. For out-of-town visitors, "Mao Family Lane" is a place that is both liked and troublesome. As a restaurant and municipal management department, can they provide customers with more joy and benefits, and fewer worries and troubles?

### 毛家湾的女雇工

　　毛家湾的女雇工
    本报记者  袁建达
    “毛家湾”位于北京火车站东侧，是一条长约７０来米的小胡同。胡同里密密排列着２０来家个体餐馆，飘散着饭菜香和油烟味。由于“毛家湾”与西城那所著名的官邸同名同姓，因此人们也把这一带叫作“小毛家湾”。
    几年前，毛家湾还是一个厕所与民房相伴的冷落去处。仅仅几年，这里就成了名闻遐迩的个体饭馆街。“香再来”、“明珠”、“都乐”、“四乡”等等别出心裁的店名吸引着饥肠辘辘的四方旅客。有了毛家湾这类的个体餐馆，初来乍到的外地人再不用为在北京找不到吃饭的地方而发愁了。
    毛家湾个体餐馆的兴隆，离不开“拉客女”。只要你步入胡同口，立刻便有二三名妙龄女郎同时围上来，喋喋不休地告诉你她那餐馆的好处，劝你到她的餐馆里进食。有的姑娘还大胆地靠近你，拽着你的衣袖强劝入室。
    进了餐馆，当然就得掏钱，假如你临“阵”逃脱，那就免不了会受一顿奚落甚至辱骂。一位黑龙江顾客被“拖”进餐馆后，发现桌子油腻不堪，打算改换门庭，谁知泼辣的安徽女雇工揪住他不放：“不吃饭干吗进店来？穷疯了怎么的？”逼得他吃下一碗“受气面”。
    雇主与雇工之间的人身依附关系和彼此一致的金钱利益，造成了餐馆与餐馆间的明争暗斗。警方提供的材料表明，“毛家湾”里打架事件层出不穷，拉客女为争夺顾客不惜撕破脸皮，严重的甚至拳脚相见。元旦过后不久，“京魁”餐馆老板为了争顾客，竟大打出手，将“新星”餐馆的一名伙计打得口鼻流血，嘴唇缝了１０来针。
    一位拉客女坦率地对记者说，不拉客就完不成老板交给的任务，工资少拿不说，兴许还要挨骂挨打。为了钱，就豁出这张脸了！
    据了解，北京共有８５００多家个体餐馆，毛家湾个体餐馆是其中影响较大的群落。对于外地人说来，“毛家湾”是个既令人喜欢，又叫人烦恼的地方。作为餐馆和市政管理部门，能否给顾客更多一些欢愉和实惠，少给以至不给忧虑和烦恼？
