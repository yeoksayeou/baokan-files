Certain rural areas have severe issues with de facto marriages and early marriages. Experts call for legal action against marriage law violators.

BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) — Currently, many rural areas in China are plagued by de facto marriages, and early marriages are also quite prevalent. These issues have drawn the attention of legal scholars.

Yang Dawen, a deputy professor at Renmin University of China who has been studying civil law and marriage law for over 30 years, introduced that many rural areas in China are currently experiencing de facto marriages. In Longhai County, Fujian Province, a Buyi Township has seen 1,228 cases of de facto marriages in recent years. In Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province, the local government, along with the Civil Affairs Bureau, Judicial Bureau, and Women's Federation, conducted a two-month investigation and found 14,700 cases of de facto marriages. Even in urban areas, there are instances of couples living together as husband and wife without proper marriage registration.

Yang Dawen mentioned that due to a lack of legal awareness, early marriages and bigamy have increased in some places. According to a survey conducted in four villages in Huian County, Fujian Province, there have been 1,347 cases of early marriages in recent years, with 188 individuals marrying before the age of 15. In coastal regions like Guangdong, as some farmers become wealthier, certain professional households and individual business owners have blatantly violated national laws by engaging in bigamy.

Yang Dawen and other legal experts urge: All levels of government should take effective measures to implement and enforce the Marriage Law, and firmly hold violators accountable. All sectors of society should uphold the dignity of the law and strive to improve people's moral standards, thereby promoting the healthy development of marital and family relationships in society.

　　某些农村事实婚姻及早婚严重
    专家呼吁对违犯婚姻法者要予以追究
    本报北京３月１４日讯  记者毛磊报道：目前我国农村不少地方普遍存在着“事实婚姻”，早婚现象也比较严重。此类现象已引起法学界人士的深切关注。
    从事民法、婚姻法研究３０多年的中国人民大学副教授杨大文介绍，现在我国农村不少地方普遍存在着“事实婚姻”。福建省龙海县一个布依乡近年来事实婚姻有１２２８对。广东潮阳县组织民政、司法、妇联等单位集中力量，在两个月中清理出事实婚姻１．４７万对。在城市中也有一些未办结婚手续就以夫妻名义同居生活的。
    杨大文说，由于一些人法制观念淡薄，不少地方早婚、重婚现象增多。据福建省惠安县对新桥、前海、城前、墩中四个村庄进行调查，近年来未到法定结婚年龄而早婚的有１３４７人，其中有１８８人年龄尚在１５岁以下。广东等沿海地区，随着一部分农民富裕程度的提高，有的专业户和个体经营者，违犯国家法律，公然重婚。
    杨大文及其他一些法学界专家呼吁：各级政府要采取切实措施，贯彻、落实《婚姻法》，对违法者要坚决予以追究。社会各界都要维护法律的尊严，致力于提高人们的道德水准，以促进社会婚姻家庭关系的健康发展。
