Legal liability is a major issue that urgently needs to be studied in the construction of our legal system. Towards the end of last year, the State Council's Bureau of Legislative Affairs held a seminar on legal liability in Suzhou. The participants discussed extensively and in depth the general theoretical issues of legal liability, as well as how to make the provisions on legal liability clear, specific, standardized, and easy to implement.

The meeting believed that legal liability is one of the criteria for evaluating a country's legal system and the effectiveness of its laws, and is an important indicator of the success or failure of legal construction. Strengthening the legal system requires finding a model for implementing legal liability and establishing a mechanism for the authority of legal liability. On this basis, the participants discussed the connotation of legal liability. Some representatives proposed that legal liability is related to obligatory norms and refers to the secondary obligation incurred by violating primary obligations. Primary obligations correspond to legal rights, while secondary obligations correspond to state power; failure to fulfill primary obligations leads to secondary obligations, and failure to fulfill secondary obligations results in state coercion. Therefore, the connotation of legal liability requires:

(1) Secondary obligations are obligations that must be fulfilled and are guaranteed by state coercion, and thus have the highest status and authority among the various forms of social responsibility. They differ from other forms of responsibility that are not guaranteed by state coercion, such as moral responsibility and disciplinary responsibility within the Party.

(2) Secondary obligations can be specified, differentiated, and quantified. Vague, abstract secondary obligations that lack quantitative and qualitative distinctions are not strict legal liabilities in the true sense.

(3) Secondary obligations can be enforced. If there is no provision for enforcement or if enforcement is not possible, it is not a secondary obligation incurred by violating a primary obligation.

(4) The establishment of primary obligations must be based on secondary obligations. Norms that do not lead to secondary obligations are unenforceable norms.

On this basis, the participants analyzed the current situation of the establishment and fulfillment of legal liability in our country. They believed that the authority to establish legal liability is unclear; the provisions on legal liability are too simple and vague; there is a lack of coordination between legal liability and obligatory norms, and between different forms of legal liability. These situations inevitably lead to arbitrary distortions in the implementation of legal liability. The lack of coercive power in legal liability also increases the difficulty of implementing legal liability, often resulting in legal liability being replaced by other forms of responsibility. The participants emphasized that these problems in legal liability are not isolated but are closely related to our legislative thinking and our understanding of the functions of law. If we do not correct the deviations in legal liability from the perspective of legislative thinking and even the overall strategy for legal construction, and seek mechanisms for the implementation of law, we will not be able to effectively achieve the goals of legal construction. The meeting proposed that how to establish the authority of legal liability, make the provisions on legal liability specific, clear, systematic, and practical, is an important topic that the theoretical circles of jurisprudence urgently need to study, and is also a basic task that the departments of legal construction cannot ignore. The theoretical circles and the departments of legal construction should strengthen the theoretical research on legal liability.

The meeting believed that the drafting of legal liability provisions should follow the following principles:

(1) The principle of legality. That is, the establishment of a certain form of legal liability must comply with legal requirements.

(2) The principle of correspondence. That is, the punishment for illegal acts should be commensurate with the nature and degree of the illegal acts.

(3) The principle of coordination. That is, legal liability should be consistent with obligatory norms, and different forms of legal liability should be coordinated.

(4) The principle of enforceability. That is, the expression, types, and scope of legal liability should be clear and specific, making it easy to implement.

　　法律责任研讨会简介
    法律责任问题是目前我国法制建设急需研究的重大课题。去年底，国务院法制局在苏州召开了法律责任专题研讨会，与会代表从理论和实践的结合上，对法律责任的一般理论问题，以及如何使法律责任条款明确、具体、规范和便于执行等问题，进行了广泛、深入的讨论。
    会议认为，法律责任是评价一国法律体系和法律实效的尺度之一，是法制建设成败的重要标志。加强法制就必须注重寻求确立法律责任便于实施的模式和树立法律责任权威的机制。在此基础上，与会代表讨论了法律责任的内涵。有代表提出，法律责任与义务性规范相联系，是指违反第一性义务而招致的第二性义务。第一性义务相对的是法律权利，第二性义务相对的是国家权力；不履行第一性义务引起第二性义务，而不履行第二性义务则导致国家强制。因此，法律责任的这一内涵要求：（１）第二性义务是以国家强制力作保证的必须履行的义务，因而在社会多样化的责任形式中具有最高地位和权威。它不同于其他以非国家强制保证实施的责任形式，如道德责任、党纪责任等。（２）第二性义务是可以具体化、可以作出范围、数量程度上的划分和区别的。笼统、抽象、没有数量和程度差别的第二性义务不是严格意义上的法律责任。（３）第二性义务是可以强制执行的。没有赋予或不能实行强制执行的，不是第一性义务所要招致的第二性义务。（４）第一性义务的设立要以第二性义务为依托，不能招致第二性义务的规范是不能实现的规范。在此基础上，与会代表对目前我国法律责任的设定和履行情况作了分析。认为，我国法律责任的设定权不明确；法律责任条款过于简单、笼统；法律责任与义务性规范之间、不同形式的法律责任之间有较多的不协调。这些情况势必导致法律责任在实施中的随意歪曲。而法律责任缺乏强制力，又增加了法律责任实现的难度，表现为法律责任常常被其他责任形式所替代。与会代表强调，法律责任中存在的这些问题不是孤立的，而是与我们的立法思想、我们对法的功能的认识紧密相关的。如果我们不从立法思想乃至整个法制建设的发展战略上来矫正法律责任出现的偏颇，寻求法律实施的机制，那就不能有效地实现法制的目的。会议提出，如何树立法律责任的权威，使法律责任条款具体、明确、自成体系而又切实可行，既是法学理论界急需研究的重要课题，也是法制工作部门不可忽视的基础工作，理论界和政法部门应当加强对法律责任的理论研究。
    会议认为，拟定法律责任条款应遵循这样一些原则：（１）合法性原则。即某一形式的法律责任的设定要符合法定要求；（２）相应性原则。即对违法行为的处罚应与违法行为的性质和程度相适应；（３）协调性原则。即法律责任与义务性规范相一致、不同形式的法律责任之间相协调；（４）可执行性原则。即法律责任的表述、种类、幅度都要明确、具体，便于执行。（国务院法制局研究室）
