Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 11th.

The Soviet Union's election of people's representatives has entered its final stage—formal voting for representatives. The All-Union Society of Inventors and Rationalizers, which has 15 million members, held an expanded meeting of its Central Council this morning. Using secret ballots, they elected the first 5 people's representatives from the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union began the nomination of candidates for people's representatives on December 26 last year. According to the new election law, there are a total of 2,250 people's representatives, with 1/3 elected by various social organizations and 2/3 elected by regions and national regions. The nomination of candidates has now basically come to an end.

Ryazhov, Deputy Head of the Party Construction and Cadres Department of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Election Commission, said at a press conference today that this election is a test for party and government leaders because, under democratic conditions, what matters is not the position but the individual's work and qualities. He revealed that 1/3 of the mayors of small cities did not become candidates for people's representatives. The first secretaries of the regional committees of Magadan and Kaliningrad also failed to make the cut.

Ryazhov said that the number of votes for and against each candidate will be made public, which is the first time in Soviet election history. He predicts that the newly established supreme state power organ will not be as unanimous as the former Supreme Soviet, but will have debates and fierce arguments. He emphasized that this will help in making wise decisions.

　　苏联开始正式选举人民代表
    三分之一小城市市长未能当候选人
    两个州的州委第一书记也名落孙山
    据新华社莫斯科３月１１日电  （记者唐修哲）苏联选举人民代表的活动今天进入了最后阶段——正式选举代表的阶段。拥有１５００万成员的全苏发明家和合理化建议者协会今天上午在中央理事会扩大全会上，用无记名投票方式选出了全苏第一批５名人民代表。
    苏联于去年１２月２６日开始了人民代表候选人的提名活动。根据新的选举法，人民代表共有２２５０名，１／３由各社会组织选出，２／３由地区和民族地区选举产生。目前，推举候选人的活动已基本结束。
    苏共中央党的建设和干部工作部副部长、中央选举委员会秘书雷若夫今天在记者招待会上指出，这次选举对党政领导干部是一次考验，因为在民主条件下起作用的不再是职务，而是个人的工作和品质。他透露，１／３的小城市的市长未能成为人民代表的候选人。马加丹州和加里宁格勒州的州委第一书记也都名落孙山。
    雷若夫说，每个候选人得到的赞成票和反对票的数目都将公布于众，这在苏联选举史上还是第一次。他预料，新成立的国家最高权力机关不会像过去的最高苏维埃那样意见“一致”，而是会有意见交锋和激烈的争论。他强调说，这样有助于作出明智的决议。
