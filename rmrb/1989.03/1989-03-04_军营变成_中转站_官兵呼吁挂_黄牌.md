Our unit is stationed in the economically vibrant southern Fujian region known as the "Golden Triangle." In recent years, relatives of some officers and soldiers have come here to do business, turning the military camp into a "transit station," making it difficult for the unit to manage. These relatives of officers and soldiers either set up stalls and shops in nearby market towns, coming and going early and late, using the barracks as their hotel; or they engage in transportation, driving trucks, tractors, and motorcycles into the camp at night, turning the training ground into a parking lot; or they buy goods at low prices to smuggle into inland areas, turning the barracks into a storage facility for goods. Soldiers say that if we don't put up a "yellow card" warning soon, the camp will become a "free market."

The influx of many relatives doing business has brought numerous management difficulties to the unit. First, the number of officers and soldiers leaving without permission has increased. For example, during the New Year, 20 people from a certain company left without permission. Upon investigation, it was found that most of these soldiers went out to help their relatives conduct market surveys and gather commodity information. Second, relatives staying for extended periods have caused housing shortages in the family quarters. Third, the large number of relatives coming to the unit for meals has increased the unit's economic burden. Statistics show that last year, some companies spent over 2,200 yuan on entertaining relatives. Fourth, some relatives doing business in the unit evade taxes and sell substandard goods, requiring the local authorities to seek the unit's assistance in handling the matter, which has affected the unit's work and training.

In response to the above situation, our unit has taken some measures, but often after persuading one group to leave, another group comes right after. If this continues, the military camp will become a "goods transit station" and a "commodity information library."

　　军营变成“中转站”  官兵呼吁挂“黄牌”
    我部驻地在商品经济活跃的闽南金三角地区。近年来，一些干部、战士的亲友到这里做生意，把军营当成了“中转站”，部队实难招架。这些干部、战士的亲友，有的在部队驻地附近的集镇上摆摊设点，早出晚归，营房成了他们的旅馆；有的跑运输，一到晚上，汽车、拖拉机、摩托车涌进军营，训练场变成了停车场；有的低价收购货物，准备向内地贩运，营房变成了货物寄存处。官兵们说，再不挂出“黄牌”，营区将成为“自由市场”。
    众多亲友来队做生意，给部队管理带来许多困难。一是干部、战士不请假外出的人数增多。某连今年元旦有２０多人私自外出。据查，这些官兵外出多数是帮亲友搞市场调查，捕捉商品信息。二是亲友长住久留，造成部队家属区住房紧张。三是亲友来队人数多，在连队吃喝，给部队增加了经济负担。据统计，去年有的连队接待官兵亲友来队费用达２２００多元。四是有的来队做生意的亲友，偷税漏税，销售伪劣商品，地方有关部门要部队出面协助处理，影响了部队的工作和训练。
    针对上述情况，我部也曾采取一些措施，但是往往好不容易劝走一批，紧接着又来一批。照此下去，军营将成为“货物中转站”、“商品信息库”。
