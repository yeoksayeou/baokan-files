People's Daily, Belgrade, March 27th

Today, the evening news on Belgrade Television replayed scenes of clashes between Albanian demonstrators and police in certain cities in Kosovo: military aircraft circled overhead, tanks and armored vehicles rolled through the streets, and fully armed riot police dispersed the demonstrators with tear gas and batons. According to reports, at least two police officers were killed and many police officers and demonstrators were injured in today's clashes.

Since the Kosovo Assembly passed the Serbian Republic's constitutional amendments on March 23rd, tens of thousands of Albanians, including many young people, students, women, and children, have taken to the streets in protest against the constitutional changes. Despite the enforcement of special measures and warnings from the Federal Presidency of Yugoslavia, they have organized and held demonstrations in seven or eight cities, including the provincial capital Pristina, Titova Mitrovica, and Podujevo. The scale of the demonstrations and the areas affected have continued to expand. The demonstrators have progressed from shouting separatist slogans to smashing shop windows, destroying cars, and directly clashing with the police. Demonstrators in Podujevo, Titova Mitrovica, and Pristina even used weapons to shoot at the police, resulting in bloodshed.

Today, the Kosovo Interior Department issued another warning, stating that these demonstrations, which use the most brutal methods such as gunfire, aim to undermine the constitutional order and threaten the lives of all ethnic groups. Any participation in or support for the demonstrations is a counter-revolutionary act, and the security authorities will take all necessary legal measures against them. Hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested and detained, and legal actions have been taken against them. The Kosovo Autonomous Province Interior Department has decided to impose a state of siege within the province, effective immediately. This includes banning assemblies, prohibiting entry into public places, and restricting gatherings of three or more people. Certain places will also be off-limits for a specified period. The decision also stipulates that schools and universities will suspend classes, theaters and cinemas will close, and public entertainment performances and sports competitions will be banned. Markets will also be closed. Currently, the security forces and police in Kosovo are on high alert, closely monitoring the situation's development.
