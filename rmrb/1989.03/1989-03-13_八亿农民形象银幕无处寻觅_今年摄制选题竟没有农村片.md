Title: The Image of 800 Million Farmers Is Nowhere to Be Found on Screen

The image of 800 million farmers seems to have disappeared from Chinese cinema screens. Among the 158 domestic feature films produced in 1988, only about ten reflected rural life, and only four or five of these were of relatively high quality.

The stark contrast between the 800 million people and the ten films shocked participants at yesterday's "Rural Themed Feature Film Symposium." The few rural films that were made also faced numerous difficulties in distribution. Films like "The Women of Huangtupo" and "Desolate Snow," which are considered to have strong ideological, artistic, and entertainment value, had a total of only about 150 copies distributed, according to optimistic estimates. This further worried the film industry, critics, and scholars studying rural issues.

The shock and concern stirred up the emotions of the attendees. Director Dong Ke'na, who directed "The Women of Huangtupo," had the most to say. The film, due to funding issues, had been started and stopped three times, enduring many hardships before it was finally completed. Despite receiving widespread praise, it still ended up losing money in distribution. This prolific and accomplished female director said she is not afraid of hard work and suffering, but she does not want to make rural films anymore.

According to officials from the Film Bureau, at the 1989 film theme planning meeting, none of the proposed topics from various film studios were rural-themed.

"Without taking measures, there will be no rural-themed films to watch in the future," warned veteran director Chen Huaiqing and the head of the Film Association, Shi Fangyu, in unison.

### 八亿农民形象银幕无处寻觅  今年摄制选题竟没有农村片

　　八亿农民形象银幕无处寻觅
    今年摄制选题竟没有农村片
    据新华社北京３月１２日电  （记者曲志红）八亿农民的形象在目前中国银幕上似乎失去了应有的位置，１９８８年拍摄的１５８部国产故事片中，反映农村生活的只有十来部，质量较好的不过四五部。
    八亿人口，十来部影片，两个数字的巨大反差，使昨天参加“农村题材故事片座谈会”的人们无不感到诧异。而这凤毛麟角的几部农村片，在发行中又遇到重重困难。被认为思想性、艺术性、娱乐性都较好的《黄土坡的婆姨们》、《荒雪》等５部影片，据乐观的估计，加起来发行的拷贝也不过１５０个左右。这使电影界、评论界和研究农村问题的学者们越加担忧。
    震惊和忧虑，使与会者的情绪颇为激动。执导《黄土坡的婆姨们》的董克娜感触尤多。这部电影因经费原因曾经三起三落，几经磨难，拍成后虽受到广泛好评，但仍在发行中落得个赔本命运。这位多产且有不少成就的女导演说她虽不怕吃苦受累，但农村片是不想再拍了。
    据电影局有关人士透露，在１９８９年电影题材规划会上，各制片厂上报的选定题目中，农村片几乎一部没有。
    “如不采取措施，今后将没有农村题材的影片可看”。老导演陈怀恺和影协负责人石方禹，不约而同提出如此警示。
