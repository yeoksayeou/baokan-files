A Serious Waste - Repeated Introduction

With the approval of the municipal government, a hospital in our city introduced a fourth-generation full-body CT (computed tomography) scanner from abroad in December 1986, which met the clinical needs of various hospitals in our city and neighboring regions. Currently, this equipment is facing issues such as insufficient patients and low utilization rates. In this situation, it is heard that three more hospitals in our city are negotiating to introduce similar equipment, and two other hospitals are also planning to do so.

To improve the overall health level of the nation, it is necessary to introduce some advanced medical equipment to achieve early treatment of diseases and early prevention of illnesses. However, the introduction of equipment must be strictly controlled and rationally distributed. Such competitive and repeated introductions will inevitably lead to equipment idling and a large waste of funds. It is hoped that relevant departments will take decisive measures to stop such actions that disregard the overall situation and do not consider economic benefits.

　　一种严重的浪费——重复引进
    经市政府批准，我市一家医院于１９８６年１２月从国外引进一台第４代全身ＣＴ（电子计算机体层扫描）设备，满足了我市各医院及其邻近地区的临床需要。目前这台设备已面临病员不足，使用率不高的情况。在这种情况下，听说我市又有３家医院着手谈判引进这种设备，还有两家医院也在计划引进。
    为了提高全民族的健康水平，做到有病早治，无病早防，适当引进一些先进医疗设备是必要的。但是，引进设备要严格掌握，合理分布。像这种竞相重复引进的做法，势必造成设备的闲置，资金的大量浪费。希望有关部门采取果断措施，制止这种不顾大局，不讲经济效益的蠢事。
