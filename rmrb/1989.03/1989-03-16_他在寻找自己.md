	He is searching for himself
		Wang Wanping

	Gao Guang's friend calls him "Xiong." When Gao Guang's rugged, lazy, and unkempt figure appears against the backdrop of the city's orderly, neat, and rigid environment, while feeling out of place, one can indeed sense a bit of the wildness from the Changbai Mountain forest.

	Gao Guang is the kind of man with a strong personality. In the 1977 college entrance examinations, with his abilities, applying to key universities within or outside the province was no problem, but he insisted on taking the graduate entrance exams and failed three times in a row, perhaps because of his poor foreign language skills. Many years later, recalling this, Gao Guang always says he has no regrets, even feeling fortunate for those three failures.

	The Northeast Great Forest is an enchanting world, which also sparked Gao Guang's literary dreams. His early works like "Dongzhu" and "No Bears in the Logging Area" are rich in legendary colors, with backgrounds familiar to his life. Later, he created "Paper Crane" and "Pillow Seal," shifting the background from deep mountains and old forests to the city, gradually expanding the content. "Paper Crane," which won the provincial excellent work award, marks Gao Guang's creative maturity.

	In the new era, various novel trends are overwhelming for innovators. Gao Guang strongly agrees that the mission of literature is to make people return to themselves. "Paper Crane" signifies his pursuit. However, writing about the city and cultural people obviously cannot allow Gao Guang to freely express everything he feels. Like most writers from a certain piece of land, ultimately, his aesthetic perspective sinks back into the land that once nurtured him. The medium-length novel "Struggle," published in "Liberation Army Literature" and later reprinted in "Novel Selection," returns to the background of Changbai Mountain, where the author is familiar with. War, history, blood, and death, in these heavy scenes, Gao Guang seems to have found his true self.

	Many young contemporary writers like to write about wars they have not personally experienced. Perhaps, war, as an extreme form of human conflict, inherently possesses a kind of masculine vigor. In "Struggle," Gao Guang continues the exploration of people in "Paper Crane." Many contemporaries, such as Mo Yan's "Red Sorghum" series, depict war scenes that are passionate, unrestrained, and magnificent, and people often feel the vitality of life rather than the war itself. Gao Guang, however, writes about war itself and the people in war. His war scenes are static; he believes that war fundamentally has no time and space, only emptiness. Gao Guang strives to look back at that war from the perspective of a Chinese person, examining his own culture, society, and ultimately, humanity.

	From "Struggle" and "Bloodshed" to the recently published "Approaching Death," one can feel that Gao Guang's journey is not easy. He walks with the tenacity of a polar bear on paths that others cannot or do not want to tread. Who dares to say this won't be another three failures? The tower of art is originally a vast labyrinth. But this is indeed his own path.

　　他在寻找自己
    王宛平
    高光的朋友叫他“熊”。当高光粗犷、懒散、不修边幅的身影出现在城市规范、齐整、刻板的背景上，在感到不协调的同时，确乎能嗅到几分来自长白山大森林的野性的气息。
    高光属于那种个性很强的男子。七七年高考，以他的实力，报考省内外重点大学不在话下，他却偏去考研究生，且一考三年，大约是外语不行，于是连连不中。事过多年，忆及此事，高光总是说不悔，甚而庆幸那三榜落第。
    东北大森林是迷人的世界，也诱发了高光的文学之梦。较早发表的《东珠》、《采伐区里没有熊》一类颇富传奇色彩的作品，以他熟悉的生活为背景。而后他创作了《纸鹤》《枕封》，背景从深山老林转向城市，内涵逐渐扩大。获省内佳作奖的《纸鹤》是高光创作走向成熟的标志。
    新时期各种小说新潮对创新者来说目不暇接。高光很赞同文学的使命就是使人回到人自身。《纸鹤》标明着他的追求。但写城市，写文化人，显然不能使高光随心所欲地表达他所感受到的一切。和大多数出自某块故土的作家一样，最终，他的审美视角还是沉入到曾养育他的那块土地。发表在《解放军文艺》、后经《小说选刊》转载的中篇小说《挣扎》，背景回到作者熟悉的长白山下，战争、历史、鲜血、死亡，在这些沉重的画面中，高光似乎找到了真正的自己。
    当代许多年轻作家，都喜欢写他们并未亲身经历的过的战争。或许，战争这种人类冲突的极端行为本身就有着一种男性的阳刚之气。在《挣扎》中，高光继续着《纸鹤》对人的探索。许多同辈作家，如莫言的红高粱系列，战争画面热烈、奔放、瑰丽，人们从中感受的往往不是战争本身，而是人的生命力的跃动。高光却实实在在地写战争本身，写战争中人本身。他的战争画面是静止的，他认为战争根本没有时间和空间，只有空白。高光力求以中国人的视点，回过头去看那场战争，对自身文化、社会，最终是对人进行审视。
    从《挣扎》、《血劫》，到最近发表的《走近死亡》可以感到高光走的并不轻松，他以北极熊式的顽强在走别人不能走或不愿走的路。谁敢说这不会是又一次三榜落第？艺术之塔原本是座巨大的迷宫。但这毕竟是他自己的路。
