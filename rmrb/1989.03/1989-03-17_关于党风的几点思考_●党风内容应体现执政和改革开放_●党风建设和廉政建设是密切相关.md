The issue of party conduct has been a hot topic among people at all levels in recent years. The author attempts to provide a rough explanation of several issues related to party conduct, hoping it can help unify thoughts and reduce blind actions.

**Understanding the Concept of "Party Conduct"**

This concept was proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong during the Rectification Campaign in Yan'an. Mao Zedong believed: "The study style and literary style are also party styles, all of which are party conduct." At the Seventh National Congress of the Party, Mao Zedong pointed out: "The Chinese Communist Party, armed with the theoretical thoughts of Marxism-Leninism, has produced a new style of work among the Chinese people, which is mainly the style of combining theory with practice, the style of closely linking with the masses, and the style of criticism and self-criticism." Since then, people generally refer to these three styles as the party's conduct. The content of party conduct is constantly enriched and developed.

Comrade Mao Zedong's discussions on party conduct help us understand the concept of "party conduct." I believe that party conduct refers to the concentrated manifestation of the party's nature and the party's line, principles, and policies in the organization and actions of the party.

**The Main Content of Party Conduct in the New Era**

Party conduct, like other political phenomena, is not static. It changes with time, the party's position, environment, and the tasks it undertakes, as well as changes in its own organizational structure. The three excellent styles of the party were formed during the long period of democratic revolution through the party's struggle against various erroneous thoughts and styles within the party. The three excellent styles are still relevant in the current era of reform and opening up, and the development of a commodity economy. However, it must be noted that the three styles can no longer encompass all the content of party conduct in the new era. The content of party conduct in the new era should reflect the two most prominent characteristics: governance and reform and opening up.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in his closing speech at the Eleventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China, pointed out that we must restore and carry forward the excellent traditions and styles established by Chairman Mao for our party, such as the "mass line," "seeking truth from facts," and "criticism and self-criticism." When Comrade Deng Xiaoping made these remarks, the party had not yet proposed the strategic decision of reform and opening up and the development of a commodity economy.

At the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party Central Committee announced that the focus of the party's work would shift to economic construction. Since then, the content of party conduct has developed further. Holding one hand to reform and opening up and economic construction, and the other hand to work in the political and ideological fields, this is the correct policy for our party to effectively resist and overcome various corruptions and pass the severe tests under the conditions of reform and the development of a commodity economy. It is also a new style that the party should possess. With the progress of the times, the content of party conduct will continue to be enriched and developed.

**Party Conduct Building and Clean Governance**

The issue that party conduct building aims to solve is how to better play the role of party organizations and party members. The issue that clean governance aims to solve is the various behaviors of all public officials, including party members, that violate laws and disciplines.

Since the majority of the staff in party and government organs are Communist Party members, party conduct building and clean governance are closely related. The nature and purpose of the party require that party conduct building should have higher-level requirements than clean governance. For example, opposing feudal privileges and personal worship, building party democracy, adhering to communist ideology and morality, etc. For party members who are in office, being clean and self-disciplined is the minimum requirement. In the new historical period of reform and opening up and the development of a commodity economy, it is even more important to adhere to the principle of promoting clean governance through party conduct building, promoting party conduct building through clean governance, and improving the overall social atmosphere through party conduct and clean governance building.

　　关于党风的几点思考
    ●党风内容应体现执政和改革开放       
    ●党风建设和廉政建设是密切相关
    刘孟君
    党风的问题，是近几年来上上下下的“热门话题”。笔者试图就党风中的几个问题进行粗浅的解释，但愿它对统一思想、减少盲目性能起一点作用。
    　　　　对“党风”概念的理解
    这个概念，是毛泽东同志在延安整风时期提出来的。毛泽东同志认为：“学风和文风也都是党的作风，都是党风”。在党的七大上，毛泽东同志指出：“以马克思列宁主义的理论思想武装起来的中国共产党，在中国人民中产生了新的工作作风，这主要是理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系在一起的作风以及批评和自我批评的作风”。从此，人们通常把这三大作风称为党的党风。党风的内容是不断丰富和发展的。
    毛泽东同志关于党风的论述，有助于我们对“党风”概念的理解。我认为，所谓党风，就是党的性质及党的路线、方针、政策在党的组织和党员行动上的集中表现。
    　　　　新时期党风的主要内容
    党风同其它政治现象一样，不是静止不变的，是随着时间的变迁、党所处的地位、环境和所担负的任务及其自身队伍结构的变化等主要条件而变化的。党的三大优良作风，是党在长期的民主革命时期同党内各种错误思想和作风的斗争中形成的。党的三大优良作风在当前改革开放、发展商品经济的新的历史时期并没有过时，还应继续发扬光大。但是，必须看到，三大作风已经不能涵括新时期党风的全部内容。新时期党风的内容应体现执政和改革开放这两个最显著的特点。
    邓小平同志《在中国共产党第十一次全国代表大会上的闭幕词》中指出，我们一定要恢复和发扬毛主席为我党树立的“群众路线的优良传统和作风……”，“实事求是的优良传统和作风……”，“批评和自我批评的优良传统和作风……”。邓小平同志讲上面这些话的时候，党还未提出改革开放和发展商品经济这个具有战略意义的重大决策。
    在党的十一届三中全会上，党中央宣告全党工作重点转移到经济建设上来。从此党风的内容又有了新的发展。一手抓改革开放和经济建设，一手抓政治和思想领域里的工作，这既是改革和发展商品经济条件下，我们党解决党组织和广大党员有效抵御和战胜各种腐蚀，经受住严峻考验的正确方针，也是党应当具备的一种崭新的作风。随着时代的前进，党风的内容还会不断地丰富和发展。
    　　　　党风建设与廉政建设
    党风建设所要解决的问题是更好地发挥党组织和党员的作用。廉政建设所要解决的问题是包括党员在内的所有公职人员违反国法政纪的各种行为。
    由于党政机关中的工作人员绝大多数都是共产党员，所以，党风建设和廉政建设密切相关。党的性质和宗旨要求党风建设应该具有比廉政建设更高层次的要求。如反对封建特权和个人崇拜，建设党内民主，坚持共产主义思想和道德等等。对于从政的共产党员，做到清廉自守，这是最起码的要求。在改革开放，发展商品经济的新的历史时期里，更要坚持以党风建设带动廉政建设，以廉政建设促进党风建设，以党风廉政建设带动整个社会风气的好转。
