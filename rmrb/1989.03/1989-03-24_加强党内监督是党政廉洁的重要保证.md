In the new situation of reform and opening up, how to maintain the cleanliness of party and government organs has become a hot topic of discussion in recent years and is a major issue that we urgently need to address.

As the ruling party, many of our party members hold leadership positions in state organs, enterprises, and public institutions. Most of the cadres at all levels are also Communist Party members, holding large and small amounts of power. From the cases of corruption discovered in the party and government organs of Yunnan in recent years, there is a common characteristic: the exchange of power for money. This raises the question of how to deal with power. Power has two aspects: it can provide conditions for our cadres to display their talents and better and more effectively serve the people, but it also has a corrupting influence and can be used by some people with bad thoughts to seek privileges and personal gain, harming the interests of the state and the people. Countless facts from history and real life, both domestic and foreign, repeatedly show that without effective supervision, power can easily lead to corruption.

The causes of corruption in party and government organs are complex and require comprehensive treatment. The key is to strengthen supervision and give full play to the role of people's supervision, social supervision, and party organization supervision. This includes administrative, legal, public opinion, and social supervision, among others. For party members and cadres, it is particularly important to strengthen party supervision. This has special significance for the construction of clean government.

Intra-party supervision mainly takes four forms:

1. Supervision by higher-level party organizations and leaders over lower-level party organizations and cadres. This means that each level should supervise the next, ensuring that the party manages the party and governs the party strictly. First, one must frequently understand the situation at the next level and conduct targeted education. Problems should be addressed promptly to keep the alarm bells ringing, rather than waiting until the problem becomes serious before taking action. Second, one must set an example for others to follow, leading by example.

2. Mutual supervision among party committee members and within the leadership team. The team should frequently exchange information, communicate openly, adhere to the principle of democratic centralism, conduct organizational life, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Currently, the organizational life within some leadership teams is not normal, and criticism and self-criticism cannot be carried out. Some erroneous phenomena are allowed to continue, problems are dealt with superficially, compromises are made, or issues are avoided to prevent offending people, creating a harmonious atmosphere without adhering to party principles. We must overcome this liberal attitude and actively carry out healthy criticism and self-criticism, frequently cleaning the "dust" from our thoughts. For corruption within the team, we must not cover up for each other and must engage in clear and resolute struggle.

3. Supervision by party members and grassroots organizations over higher levels. Party leaders should participate in grassroots organizational life and listen to the opinions and criticisms of grassroots organizations and party members. Grassroots organizations and party members should promptly convey any opinions they hear to their leaders. All party members should strengthen their supervision consciousness and dare to supervise violations of discipline and law. All levels of organizations should establish and improve necessary systems to create necessary conditions for party members and the masses to exercise supervision and to ensure and support supervision. Party members, in accordance with the provisions of the Party Constitution, have the right to supervise party leaders. This is not only a great impetus to the construction of clean government but also an important component of building intra-party democracy. Party members who undertake leadership work must properly handle the relationship between the individual and the organization, actively support supervision, and voluntarily accept supervision.

4. Supervision by the party's disciplinary inspection departments. The disciplinary inspection departments are the supervisory departments within the party, and disciplinary inspection work is an important aspect of strengthening party building and ensuring that party members are clean and upright. Currently, the tasks of the disciplinary inspection departments are heavy and arduous, and they often encounter various obstacles in their work. When handling some disciplinary cases, they often face the dilemma of "fearing to offend the rat while striking at the weasel," finding it difficult to proceed. Some disciplinary inspection cadres have developed various concerns and difficulties, feeling that disciplinary inspection work is "difficult to do, done poorly, and not done well." This makes it all the more necessary for party committees, especially the responsible comrades of party committees, to strongly support the disciplinary inspection departments, helping them overcome difficulties and remove interference, giving them the courage and support to play a more effective role in the construction of clean government.

Comrade Zhao Ziyang pointed out: "I think that whether it is strict governance of the party or party supervision, it should be conducted around the key issue of ensuring the cleanliness of party and government organs." How to do a good job of supervision has already yielded some good experiences that should be promoted. But truly institutionalizing and regularizing supervision still requires hard work and continued exploration.

　　加强党内监督是党政廉洁的重要保证
    中共云南省委副书记  聂荣贵
    在改革开放的新形势下，怎样才能保持党政机关的廉洁，近年来已成为人们议论的热门话题，也是摆在我们面前一个亟待解决的重大课题。
    作为执政党，我们的许多党员担负着国家机关、企事业单位的领导职务，各级干部也大都是共产党员，手中掌握着大大小小的权力。从云南党政机关近年来发现的腐败现象看，有一个共同的特点，就是权力与金钱的交换。这给我们提出了一个如何对待权力的问题。权力具有两重性，它既可以为我们的干部提供发挥才干的条件，用来更好地、更有效地为人民群众谋求福利，同时又具有腐蚀作用，可以被个别思想不好的人用来为自己谋取特权和私利，侵害国家和群众的利益。中外历史上、现实生活中无数的事实反复说明，没有切实有效的监督，权力很容易导致腐败现象的发生。
    党政机关出现腐败现象，原因比较复杂，必须进行综合治理。关键要加强监督，发挥人民监督、社会监督和党组织的监督作用。包括行政的、法律的、舆论的、社会的监督等等。对党员干部来讲，很重要的是加强党的监督。这对廉政建设有着特别重要的意义。
    党内监督主要有四种形式：
    一是上级党组织、上级领导对下级党组织和下级干部的监督。这就是要一级抓一级，把党管党、从严治党落到实处。首先要经常了解下一级在这方面的情况，有针对性地进行教育。发现问题及时提醒，做到警钟常鸣，不要等到问题严重了才来处理。再就是本身要作出榜样，做到一级带一级。
    二是党委成员、领导班子内部的相互监督。班子内部要经常交流情况，交心通气，坚持民主集中制原则，过好组织生活，认真开展批评与自我批评。当前，一部分领导班子内的组织生活不正常，开展不了批评与自我批评，对一些错误现象放任自流，遇到问题敷衍了事，调和折衷，或者“绕道走”，怕得罪人，搞一团和气，不敢坚持党的原则。我们要克服这种自由主义的态度，积极开展健康的批评与自我批评，经常清除思想上沾染的“灰尘”。对于班子内出现的腐败现象，不能“官官相护”，要进行旗帜鲜明的斗争。
    三是党员群众、基层组织对上级的监督。党员领导干部应该参加基层的组织生活，听取基层组织和党员的意见和批评。党的基层组织和党员听到有什么意见要及时转告领导同志。全体党员要增强监督意识，对违纪违法事件敢于监督。各级组织要建立健全必要的制度，为党员和群众行使监督创造必要的条件，切实保证和支持监督。党员依照党章的规定，对党员领导干部行使监督的权力，这不仅对廉政建设是一个巨大的推动，也是建设党内民主的一个重要组成部分。担负领导工作的党员，必须摆正个人与组织的关系，要大力支持监督，自觉接受监督。
    四是党的纪检部门的监督。纪检部门是党内的监督部门，纪检工作是加强党的建设，保证党员廉洁奉公的一个重要方面。当前，纪检部门的任务繁重而艰苦，开展工作常常遇到各种各样的阻力，在查处一些违纪案件时，往往有“投鼠忌器”的情况，感到棘手。有的纪检干部产生了各种顾虑和畏难情绪，认为纪检工作“不好干、干不好、不干好”。这就更需要各级党委特别是党委的负责同志旗帜鲜明地大力支持，要帮助他们克服困难、排除干扰，为他们撑腰壮胆，让他们在廉政建设中更有效地发挥作用。
    赵紫阳同志指出：“我觉得从严治党也好，党的监督也好，都要围绕着保证党政机关廉洁这个关键来进行。”怎样搞好监督，现在已经有了一些好的经验，应该加以推广。但真正把监督制度化、经常化，还有待努力工作、继续探索。
