The Fountain of Life's Devotion
Poem by Liu Lianyong

Disasters never make appointments;
They always barge into unprepared doorways,
As if nine suns have appeared in the sky,
Scorching the earth's lips, parching them dry.

Yet, do not lose your way in panic,
Do not tightly shut your eyes in pain.
Do not let despair entwine with hope.
Believe that miracles will be born in your hands.

The morning star has fallen as a drop of sweet dew,
Drip by drip, the dew gathers into a trickling spring.
The cracked earth will once again sprout
Clusters of green crowns like clouds.

### 奉献生命的甘泉

    奉献生命的甘泉
    刘连勇配诗
    灾难从不预约
    总是蛮横闯进毫无准备的门坎
    仿佛天空出现九个太阳
    把大地的嘴唇烤焦灼干
    然而，不要在惊慌中走失
    不要紧闭痛苦的眼睑
    任绝望把希望厮缠
    坚信奇迹会在手中诞生
    启明星已垂落成一滴甘泉
    滴滴泉水汇成泉水涓涓
    龟裂的大地便依然蓬生出
    一团团如云的绿冠
