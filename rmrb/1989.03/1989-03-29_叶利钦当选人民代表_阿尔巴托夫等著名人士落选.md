The first deputy chairman of the Soviet State Construction Committee and Soviet Minister Boris Yeltsin was elected as a Soviet People's Representative with an overwhelming 89.44% of the votes.

According to the constitutional amendments and election law passed last December, except for the chairman of the Council of Ministers, other government members are not allowed to run for the position of People's Representative. However, Yeltsin stated that he would rather give up his ministerial post to become a People's Representative, and thus participated in the election of the Moscow First National District. In the voting held on March 26, he defeated his opponent, the general manager of Likhachev Automobile Plant, Brakov.

The complete results of this People's Representative election will be announced in a few days, but from the preliminary election results released here, it can be seen that voter turnout was high, and a considerable number of well-known figures and party and government officials at various levels failed to win seats. Among them are the Central Committee member of the CPSU and expert on American affairs, Albatsov; the famous commentator of the *Izvestia* newspaper, Bovin; the renowned playwright, Shatrov; and the first secretary of the Leningrad City Committee, Grashimov (who only received 15% of the votes), as well as the mayor of Moscow, Sakharov, and five first secretaries of regional committees.

　　叶利钦当选人民代表        
    阿尔巴托夫等著名人士落选
    新华社莫斯科３月２８日电  苏联国家建委第一副主席、苏联部长鲍里斯·叶利钦以８９．４４％的压倒多数票当选为苏联人民代表。
    按照去年１２月通过的宪法修正案和选举法，除部长会议主席外，其他政府成员均不能竞选人民代表。但是，叶利钦表示，他宁愿放弃部长职位也要当人民代表，于是参加了莫斯科第一民族区域选区的竞选。在３月２６日举行的投票选举中，他击败了竞争对手——利哈乔夫汽车厂总经理布拉科夫。
    这次人民代表选举的全部结果将在几天后才能公布，但从此间发表的初步选举结果看，选民投票踊跃，相当一部分知名人士和党政各级负责人落选，其中有苏共中央委员、美国问题专家阿尔巴托夫、《消息报》著名评论员鲍文、著名剧作家沙特罗夫和列宁格勒市委书记格拉西莫夫（仅获１５％的选票）、莫斯科市长赛金以及五个州委第一书记。
