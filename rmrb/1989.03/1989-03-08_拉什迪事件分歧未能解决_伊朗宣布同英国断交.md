Today, due to the unresolved differences between Britain and Iran over the Rushdie incident, Iran announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Britain.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that because Britain did not clarify its position on the Rushdie incident within the one-week deadline set by Iran, according to the resolution passed by the Iranian parliament on February 28, Iran announced the severance of diplomatic relations with Britain at the end of the one-week period.

During this one-week period, Britain acknowledged that Rushdie's book "The Satanic Verses" had hurt the feelings of Muslims, but it insisted on defending the right to publish the book and demanded that Iran revoke the "death sentence" against Rushdie. Iran was not satisfied with this. The British Foreign Office, when commenting on the severance of diplomatic ties, said that it had not yet received a formal notification from Iran regarding the break in relations, and added that the current situation was caused by Iran.

　　拉什迪事件分歧未能解决
    伊朗宣布同英国断交
    本报伦敦三月七日电  记者陈特安报道：今天，由于英伊在拉什迪事件上的分歧未能得到解决，伊朗宣布与英国断绝外交关系。
    伊朗外交部声明说，因为英国没有在伊朗提出的一周期限内澄清它在拉什迪事件上的立场，故根据二月二十八日伊朗议会投票通过的议案，伊朗在一周的期限结束时，宣布断绝与英国的外交关系。
    在此一周期间内，英国承认拉什迪的书《撒旦诗篇》伤害了穆斯林人的感情，但它依然坚持维护这本书的出版权利，并要求伊朗撤消“处死”拉什迪的指令。伊朗对此仍不满意。英国外交部在谈到英伊断交时说，现在尚没有接到伊朗方面关于断交的正式通知书，还说，目前的局面是伊朗方面造成的。
