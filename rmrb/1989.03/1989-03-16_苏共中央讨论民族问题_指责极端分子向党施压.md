	The Soviet Communist Party Central Committee held a meeting today on nationality issues, criticizing certain extremist groups for raising inflammatory slogans and attempting to pressure the Party and Soviet organs to make hasty decisions, such as amending the current constitutions of the union republics, on a temporary basis.

	The meeting noted that in some cases, the extremists' slogans have deceived some residents. Therefore, it is necessary to make the working people understand that nationality issues cannot be resolved overnight; each step must be carefully considered and must be systematic and coherent.

	The meeting pointed out that although some progress has been made in the previous stage in drafting laws to adjust national relations and in solving problems related to national languages, national cultures, and ecology, some work has not yet met the requirements of the developing situation.

	For a period of time, national conflicts have occurred in the Soviet Union. How to properly handle national relations has become a major issue facing the Soviet leaders. The Soviet Communist Party Central Committee will hold a full meeting to address nationality issues in June this year.

　　苏共中央讨论民族问题  指责极端分子向党施压
    新华社莫斯科３月１４日电  苏共中央今天就民族问题召开会议，指责某些极端主义集团提出过激的口号进行投机，企图向党和苏维埃机关施加压力。迫使他们在权宜的基础上匆忙作出诸如修改现行加盟共和国宪法的决定。
    会议认为，极端主义分子的口号在某些情况下迷惑了部分居民。因此，必须使劳动人民懂得，民族问题不可能一下子得到解决，每走一步都要仔细斟酌，要有顺序性和连贯性。
    会议指出，尽管前一阶段在拟定调整民族关系的法律及解决民族语言、民族文化和生态等问题方面取得了一些进展，但有些工作尚未达到形势发展要求的那样。
    一个时期以来，苏联民族纠纷时有发生。如何处理好民族关系已成为苏联领导人面临的一大课题。苏共中央将于今年６月召开解决民族问题的苏共中央全会。
