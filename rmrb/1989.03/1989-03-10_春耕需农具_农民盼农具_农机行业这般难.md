Spring plowing requires farm tools; farmers are eagerly awaiting them. The agricultural machinery industry is facing difficulties.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 9 (Reporter Gu Honghong) The earth is awakening, and spring plowing is approaching. The agricultural machinery production and sales industry, which was usually bustling at this time of year, is now facing significant challenges. The production and sales of several major agricultural machinery products have experienced significant fluctuations. The Ministry of Machinery and Electronics has called on the agricultural machinery industry to consider the bigger picture and do everything possible to overcome the difficulties.

The data provided by the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics shows that the production of seven major agricultural machinery products in January decreased compared to the same period last year. Among them, agricultural large tractors decreased by 43%, tea processing machinery decreased by 38%, small tractors decreased by 24%, and medium and large tractors decreased by 19%. The sales revenue of agricultural machinery also decreased by 1 to 4.5 times.

The competent authorities believe that most agricultural machinery enterprises are restricted by funds and power supply, and their production capacity cannot be fully utilized. Some agricultural machinery companies responsible for organizing the sales of agricultural machinery tools are also constrained by a lack of funds and are unable to organize the supply of goods for normal sales activities. In many places, this has resulted in farmers having money but being unable to purchase agricultural machinery tools, while agricultural machinery factories have products that are not selling.

　　春耕需农具　农民盼农具
    农机行业这般难
    据新华社北京３月９日电  （记者顾洪洪）地气萌动，春耕来临。往年此际早已沸腾的农机生产和销售业，如今却困难不少，几种主要农机产品的产销均出现较大幅度的波动。机电部要求农机行业顾全大局，千方百计渡过难关。
    机电部提供的数字表明，１月份７种主要农机产品产量比去年同期下降，其中农用大拖车下降４３％，茶叶加工机械下降３８％，小型拖拉机下降２４％，大中型拖拉机下降１９％。农机销售额也减少了１至４．５成。
    主管部门认为，大部分农机企业受资金和供电限制，生产能力不能充分发挥。负责组织农机具销售的一些农机公司，也受资金短缺制约，无力组织货源进行正常销售活动。在不少地方造成了农民手中拿着钱买不到农机具，同时，农机厂的产品还有积压卖不出去的情况。
