The electronic information service system for the 11th Asian Games, often referred to as the "nervous system" of the Games, has successfully emerged from its difficulties and is making satisfactory progress. The entire project is expected to be completed by next March.

Dai Weiyong, Director of the Technical Department and Chief Engineer of the 11th Asian Games Organizing Committee, recently told reporters that the project is scheduled to begin system integration in June this year, complete the final integration by March next year, conduct a dress rehearsal in April, freeze the technology in June, and commence trial operations in September.

The electronic information service system for the Beijing Asian Games includes computers, communications, broadcasting and television, timing and scoring, and refereeing video recording. During the Games, it will ensure the smooth conduct of competitions and provide accurate information services for participating teams, journalists, officials, and tourists.

It is understood that due to financial difficulties, this project has faced several ups and downs and has been in a state of stagnation. Dai Weiyong said that the Organizing Committee is highly concerned about the progress of the electronic information project and has decided to allocate 100 million yuan for this construction, bringing the late-starting project back on track.

The core of the electronic information service system project—the computer engineering—is being undertaken by BIIPC, a company under the Beijing Municipal Commission of Science and Technology. The consulting system engineering has been completed by half, and related equipment is being debugged in the central machine room. After the completion of the competition venues, the installation and debugging of the equipment will be carried out in sequence. Dai, the Chief Engineer, said that 650 computer terminals will be installed in 28 competition venues, the news center, and various team accommodations, which will basically meet the needs of all parties.

He said that during the Asian Games, 1,656 telephones will be installed, including 933 within Beijing, 329 international direct-dial, and 394 domestic direct-dial. Additionally, 75 communication dedicated lines, 81 commentary voice channels, 62 telex machines, 135 fax machines, 23 picture fax machines, and two color photo fax machines, as well as 100 car-mounted telephones will be provided. The communication project undertaken by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is progressing relatively quickly, with the required telecommunications cable engineering currently completed by 90%.

In the western suburbs of Beijing, a tall cylindrical concrete structure is rising, which is the television tower project under construction. Additionally, the construction of the International News Broadcasting and Television Exchange Center has also begun. Dai Weiyong told reporters that the Central Television Station will add 8 television broadcast vehicles, 20 sets of camera equipment, and a set of television directing equipment. At that time, relevant personnel and journalists can simultaneously see the live broadcast images of 8 channels in the news center.

It is understood that more and more countries and regions have proposed requirements for broadcasting the live events of the Asian Games. In response, Dai Weiyong said that the Technical Department will consider expanding the scale of the equipment to adapt to this new situation. The timing and scoring system for the Beijing Asian Games is planned to use equipment from the Swiss Timing Company. The Technical Department is currently negotiating with the company, and the details will be finalized soon.

Dai Weiyong was interviewed by reporters at the Asian Games Organizing Committee's command center in the northern suburbs. He believes that although funding is still tight and technical strength is somewhat lacking, if progress and quality are well-managed and no problems arise, this project can be completed on schedule.

　　亚运会电子工程进展顺利
    第十一届亚运会组委会技术部负责人最近告诉记者：被称为亚运会神经的电子信息服务系统工程已从困境中摆脱出来，进展情况令人满意，全部工程可望明年３月完成。
    亚运会技术部部长兼总工程师戴维镛说，预计该工程今年６月开始进行联调，明年３月总联完毕，４月彩排，６月技术冻结，９月开始试运行。
    北京亚运会的电子信息服务系统包括计算机、通信、广播电视、计时计分和仲裁录相等。亚运会期间，它将保证比赛的顺利进行，并为参赛各队、新闻记者、官员和旅游者提供准确的信息服务。
    据了解，由于资金困难，这项工程曾几上几下，一度处于困境。戴维镛说，组委会非常关心电子信息工程的进展情况，并决定拨款一亿元用于这项建设，使这项起步晚的工程重上轨道。
    电子信息服务系统工程的中枢——计算机工程，是由北京市科委所属的ＢＩＩＰＣ公司承担的。其中咨询系统工程已完成了一半，有关设备正在中心机房调试，待比赛场馆竣工后将陆续进行设备的安装和调试工作。戴总工程师说，在２８个比赛场馆、新闻中心和各代表团住地，将安装６５０台计算机终端，基本可以满足各方面的需要。
    他说，亚运会期间将安装１６５６部电话，其中北京市内９３３部、国际直拨３２９部、国内直拨３９４部。此外还提供７５条通讯专线，８１席评论声、６２台电传机、１３５台文传机、２３台图片传真机和两台彩色照片传真机，车载电话１００部。由邮电部承担的通信工程进展较快，所需电讯电缆工程目前已经完成了９０％。
    在北京西郊，一座高大的圆柱形水泥建筑拔地而起，这是正在建设中的电视塔工程。此外，国际新闻广播电视交流中心大厦工程也已破土动工。戴维镛对记者说，中央电视台将新添８台电视转播车，２０套摄像设备和一套电视导演设备。届时，有关人员和新闻记者可以在新闻中心同时看到８个频道的现场直播图像。
    据了解，有越来越多的国家和地区提出了电视转播亚运会实况要求。对此，戴维镛表示技术部将考虑扩大设备的规模以适应这一新情况。北京亚运会的计时计分系统拟使用瑞士计时公司的设备，技术部正与该公司洽谈，近期即可落实。
    戴维镛是在北郊的亚运会组委会指挥部接受记者采访的。他认为，目前资金仍是相当紧的，技术力量也比较缺，但是，如果在进度和质量上抓得好，不出问题，这项工程是能够按期完成的。
