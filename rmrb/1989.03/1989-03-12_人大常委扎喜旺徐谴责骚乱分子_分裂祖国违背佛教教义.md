NPC Standing Committee Member Zaxi Wangxu Condemns Rioters
Dividing the Country Contradicts Buddhist Teachings

	BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) — Zaxi Wangxu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, expressed strong indignation and condemnation today at the rioting by a small number of separatist elements in Lhasa. He also expressed firm support for the State Council's order to impose martial law in Lhasa.

	The Tibetan member said that in recent years, a small number of separatist elements, in collusion with external forces, have deliberately and systematically incited the division of the country, continually creating disturbances, attacking state organs, damaging public property, and endangering the personal safety of citizens. Workers have been unable to go to work, schools have been forced to suspend classes, and people are living in fear, making Lhasa an unstable city. The broad masses of the Tibetan people have long been deeply distressed by the evil deeds of these separatist elements. Buddhist teachings emphasize "honoring the country, loving the nation and religion, benefiting all sentient beings, and benefiting others and oneself." The actions of a very small number of Buddhists who divide the country and undermine national unity are completely contrary to this sacred teaching.

　　人大常委扎喜旺徐谴责骚乱分子
    分裂祖国违背佛教教义
    据新华社北京３月１１日电  （记者何平）全国人大常委会委员扎喜旺徐在今天结束的七届全国人大常委会第七次会议上，对少数分裂主义分子在拉萨制造骚乱表示气愤和谴责，对国务院关于在拉萨实行戒严的命令表示坚决拥护。
    这位藏族委员说，近几年，少数分裂主义分子内外勾结，有预谋、有组织地煽动分裂祖国，不断制造骚乱，聚众冲击国家机关，破坏公共财产，公民人身安全得不到保障，职工无法正常上班，学校被迫停课，人心惶惶，使拉萨成了一个不安定的城市。广大藏族人民对少数分裂主义分子的罪恶行径，早已痛心疾首。佛教教义讲“庄严国土，爱国爱教，利乐有情，利他利人。”极少数佛教徒分裂祖国统一，破坏民族团结的行径，是完全违背这个神圣教义的。
