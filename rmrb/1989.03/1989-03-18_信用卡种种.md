In recent years, credit cards have become increasingly popular in Western industrialized countries, and the competition for the credit card market has intensified.

The earliest "credit cards" appeared in the United States in 1915. They were metal badges used for shopping at designated stores. Today, the country with the highest usage of credit cards is still the United States, where 220 million credit cards are in circulation. In Western Europe, the countries with the highest usage of credit cards are Britain and France. Credit cards are also known as "electronic lines" or "plastic cards." Only individuals who meet the income standards set by the issuing organization are eligible to obtain a credit card.

Currently, the various types of credit cards in circulation internationally, used by individuals, families, and companies, can be generally categorized as follows:

Check Guarantee Card: Used to verify the authenticity of check holders, allowing cardholders to cash their checks at a wide network of banks. This type of card has limited functionality and is monopolized by banks.

Automatic Teller Card: Used to withdraw cash from automatic teller machines. Originally a bank product, some supermarkets also provide the same service for this type of credit card.

Universal Payment Card: Used in restaurants, stores, hotels, and airlines for large transactions, replacing cash and checks. However, some bank credit cards also serve the same purpose. A variant of this method is the "specialty card," issued by large stores or cooperative sales networks, but only accepted by the issuing organization. The main feature of payment cards is that the expenses incurred by the cardholder are usually settled at the end of the month, so the cardholder does not need to pay interest from the time of purchase until the settlement date.

The latest type of full-fledged credit card adopts a method where the cardholder pays the expenses in installments and pays interest, also known as a "debit card." The competition between "payment cards" and "debit cards" is the most intense area between bank operators and non-bank operators. The interest of non-bank operators lies in maintaining stable customers by issuing "specialty" credit cards and taking over the management of cash and interest calculation dates from banks.

Issuing credit cards faces the problem of preventing fraud. Last year, fraud resulted in a loss of $500 million for Visa and MasterCard. Countries with widespread use of credit cards must seriously study new security systems for credit cards. The results of these studies are gradually phasing out the easily counterfeited first-generation magnetic credit cards, replacing them with various microprogrammed credit cards. Microprogrammed credit cards can remember information, and those who do not know the password cannot use them. Advanced microprogrammed credit cards can also allow cardholders to change passwords and reprogram memory, requiring all sales points to install terminal equipment that can read memory, identify passwords, and immediately notify the issuing department.

Additionally, the forgery of credit cards or the malfunctioning of credit cards has raised legal issues. Currently, the European Community Commission is studying solutions. Except for Denmark (and Norway and the United States outside the European Community), there are no specific laws regarding credit cards in the European Community countries. Apart from general banking regulations, such disputes are often resolved based on the contract between the credit card issuer and the cardholder.

　　信用卡种种
    本报记者  罗晋标
    近年来，信用卡在西方工业国家大为流行，争夺信用卡市场的竞争也日趋激烈。
    最早的“信用卡”于１９１５年出现在美国，那是一种金属徽章，用于在指定商店购物。如今使用信用卡最多的也是美国，那里有２．２亿张信用卡在流通。英国和法国是西欧国家中使用信用卡最多的国家。信用卡的别号又叫“电子线”、“塑料卡”。只有达到发行单位规定的收入水平者才有取得信用卡的资格。
    目前在国际上流通的个人、家庭、公司使用的信用卡，大体有如下几种：
    支票保险卡　用于识别支票持有者的真伪，使持卡者能在广泛的银行网中兑换其支票。这种卡作用有限，由银行垄断。
    自动取款卡　用于在自动取款机上取现款，本为银行产品，但有的超级市场也为此信用卡提供同样的服务。
    通用支付卡　在餐厅、商店、旅馆、航空公司的大笔生意中使用，以取代现钞和支票，但有些银行信用卡也有同样作用。这种手段的一个变种叫“专营卡”，由大商店或联营销售网发行，但只能由发行单位接受。支付卡的主要特点是，持卡者所花费用一般至月底结算，因此持卡者不用支付从购物至结帐那段时间的利息。
    最新的一种完全意义的信用卡，采取了持卡者分期支付开支并付利息的办法，又称为“欠帐卡”。“支付卡”和“欠帐卡”，是银行经营者和非银行经营者之间竞争最激烈的领域。非银行经营者的兴趣在于，通过发行“专营”信用卡来保持其稳定的顾客，并且把现金和利息计算起止日期的管理权从银行那里拿过来。
    发行信用卡碰到了如何防止诈骗的问题。去年，诈骗使维萨和万事达两种信用卡损失５亿美元。广泛使用信用卡的国家不得不认真研究信用卡的新的安全系统，研究结果正在使易被伪造的第一代磁性信用卡逐渐被淘汰，代之以各种微程序信用卡。微程序信用卡能记忆，不知密码者无法使用。先进的微程序信用卡还可让持卡者改变密码、重编记忆程序，这就需要所有销售点都安装上能读出记忆、识别密码、即时通知发行部门的终端机设备。
    此外，伪造信用卡或信用卡失灵还引起了司法问题，目前欧共体委员会正在研究解决办法。欧共体国家中除丹麦外（欧共体外国家除挪威和美国外）均没有关于信用卡的专门法律。除一般银行规定外，这种纠纷往往根据信用卡发行单位和持卡者之间的合同解决。
