On the afternoon of January 21, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China invited leaders from various local democratic parties and the Sichuan Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce to visit the provincial committee, welcoming the New Year and discussing reforms.

Among the leaders of the democratic parties, many are well-known senior experts and professors both domestically and internationally. Therefore, the issue of education naturally became a common topic for everyone's speeches. Professor Pan Daqing, honorary chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, raised a sharp criticism to Zhang Huo Ruo, the vice-secretary of the provincial committee and governor, who was sitting opposite him: "Many people have opinions about your government work report delivered at the provincial people's congress yesterday morning. You placed the education issue in the ninth position, making it 'old nine' again. In your report, you discussed many serious issues, but you did not mention the seriousness of the education problem. Does this indicate that the leadership feels good about themselves and lacks a sense of crisis and urgency regarding the backwardness of education?" Zhang Huo Ruo listened with a smile, nodding frequently, indicating his acceptance of the criticism.

The leaders of the democratic parties, in their speeches, particularly hoped that the Communist Party would strictly govern itself, starting from the leading organs, and from the provincial committee in Sichuan. Yang Ruodai, the secretary of the provincial committee, agreed with this, and he also "exposed" himself once: "Someone reported that I issued a note to the Changhong Factory to buy several color TVs, and I asked the relevant departments to thoroughly investigate this. The investigation result was that I had never issued a note to buy color TVs. In fact, in 1984, when the Changhong Factory just started producing color TVs, they sent one to me for trial viewing, and I immediately returned it to the Ministry of Electronics Industry."

Liu Yunbo, the honorary chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League for Agriculture and Industry, who is 84 years old, is a female expert who has long been engaged in maternal and child health work. She seized the last few minutes to raise two suggestions: first, after the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress promulgated the single law on family planning last year, the province reduced the birth rate by 100,000 people, which is a significant achievement. However, for Sichuan Province, which has a population of over 100 million, family planning work still needs to be tightened; second, she sincerely requested the provincial committee secretary and governor, regardless of how tight the funds are, to establish a maternal and child health hospital to better guarantee the health of women and children. Yang Ruodai agreed to consider this issue and expressed that such meetings should be held in the future to create more opportunities for democratic parties to participate in politics and supervision, working together to make Sichuan's affairs better.

　　参政议政民主监督
    四川省委邀民主党派人士作客听取批评
    １月２１日下午，中共四川省委邀请各民主党派地方组织和省工商联的负责人到省委作客，迎接新春，共商改革。
    各民主党派负责人中，很多是国内外知名的老专家、老教授，因此，教育问题自然成了大家发言的共同主题。省民盟名誉主席潘大逵教授向坐在他对面的省委副书记、省长张皓若提了一条尖锐的意见：“很多人对你昨天上午在省人大会议上作的《政府工作报告》有意见。你在报告中把教育问题放在第九位，又成了‘老九’。你在报告中谈了很多严重问题，唯独没有提到教育问题严重。这是否说明领导同志自我感觉良好，对教育落后的问题还缺乏危机感、紧迫感？”张皓若面带笑容、频频点头，表示接受批评。
    各民主党派负责人在发言中，特别希望共产党从严治党，首先从领导机关抓起，在省里从省委抓起。省委书记杨汝岱对此表示赞同，他在会上也“曝”了一次“光”：“有人反映我批条子到长虹厂买了多少台彩电，我要有关部门坚决查清。调查结果，我不仅没批过条子买彩电，事实是，１９８４年长虹厂刚生产彩电时，送了一台给我试看，我立即给电子工业厅退回去了”。
    省农工民主党名誉主委、８４岁高龄的刘云波，是一位长期从事妇幼保健工作的女专家，她争取最后几分钟，提了两条意见，第一，四川省人大去年颁布了计划生育单行法规以后，全省少生育１０万人，是很大成绩，但对已超过一亿人口的四川省，计划生育工作还要抓紧；第二，她恳请省委书记和省长，无论经费怎么紧张，要建立一所妇幼保健院，以更好地保障妇女和儿童的健康。杨汝岱同志答应考虑这个问题。并表示这样的会议今后还要举行，为各民主党派参政议政创造更多的条件，共同努力，把四川的事情办得更好。　　　　　（黄昌禄）
