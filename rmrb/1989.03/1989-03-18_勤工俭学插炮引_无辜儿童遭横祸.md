In mid-December last year, Zhou Guowu, the deputy director of the Firecracker Factory in Baimiaohe Township, my county, approached Wu Yazheng, the deputy principal of Baimiaohe Village Primary School, stating that the factory was short-staffed and requested that students help insert firecracker fuses, for which the factory would pay a certain amount. Wu Yazheng agreed without authorization. On December 11, Zhou Guowu delivered some firecrackers to the school. On December 19, Principal Deng Faqiu, upon learning of this, not only did not stop it but also decided with Wu Yazheng to reduce physical education classes and have the physical education teacher specifically oversee the students' work of inserting firecracker fuses. The school also designated a classroom to store the firecrackers.

From December 11 last year to January 2 this year, the school received a total of 1,080 boxes of firecrackers from the factory. Students had already inserted fuses into 400 boxes and returned them to the factory, leaving over 600 boxes stored in the designated classroom. On January 4, the county public security bureau and the Baimiaohe police station discovered this situation and severely criticized the responsible parties at the firecracker factory and the school. The next day, they sent a "hazard notice" to the firecracker factory and the school, demanding that the issue be rectified by January 7. However, the responsible parties at the school and the firecracker factory ignored the notice and not only failed to remove the firecrackers stored in the school but also continued to produce firecrackers in the classroom. At around 2 PM on January 6, Zhou Guowu was performing the sealing operation for the firecrackers using sulfur, potassium chlorate, cement, and other materials in the classroom when an explosion occurred. The explosion collapsed two large sections of the classroom, resulting in the death of one first-grade student and the serious injury of five others, causing economic losses of over 30,000 yuan. We urge relevant departments to learn from this accident at Baimiaohe Village Primary School, correct the direction of work-study programs, and never overlook safety!

### 勤工俭学插炮引  无辜儿童遭横祸

　　勤工俭学插炮引  无辜儿童遭横祸
    去年１２月上旬，我县白庙河乡鞭炮厂副厂长周国武对白庙河村小学副校长吴亚征说，鞭炮厂人手少忙不过来，让学生帮忙插鞭炮引线，厂里付给一定的报酬。吴亚征擅自同意了。１２月１１日，周国武给学校送去一些鞭炮。１２月１９日，校长邓发魁知道这一情况后，不但未予制止，反而与吴亚征决定：减少体育课时，让体育教师专门负责学生插鞭炮引线的工作。同时学校还腾出一间教室作为鞭炮保管室。
    去年１２月１１日到今年１月２日，学校共从鞭炮厂领取鞭炮１０８０盘，学生已插鞭炮引线并退回厂４００盘，其余６００多盘都存放在那间教室里。１月４日，我县公安局、白庙河派出所发现了这一情况，对鞭炮厂和学校负责人提出严厉批评。次日又给鞭炮厂和学校送去“隐患通知书”，限１月７日前改正。然而，学校和鞭炮厂负责人置若罔闻，不但未将存放在学校内的鞭炮搬走，而且继续在教室内生产鞭炮。１月６日下午２时许，周国武在教室内用硫磺、氯酸钾、水泥等物进行鞭炮封口作业时引起爆炸，炸塌教室两大间，一年级的学生被炸死１人，重伤５人，造成经济损失３万多元。呼吁有关部门从白庙河村小学这起事故中吸取教训，端正勤工俭学的方向，切不可忽视安全！
