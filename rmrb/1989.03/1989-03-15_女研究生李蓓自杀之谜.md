February 14th, a Tuesday. Li Bei, a 33-year-old graduate student majoring in ethnic music theory at the Central Conservatory of Music, took a large dose of phenobarbital, dressed in her pajamas, and silently left the world in her dormitory at the conservatory.

A national talent nurtured with significant investment, a young woman in her prime, why did she choose to end her life?

Li Bei was a young woman with a delicate appearance and an introverted personality. Seven years ago, while working at the Guangxi Nanning Drama Troupe, she met a young man named Huo. Due to changes in their work, they parted ways. Later, Li Bei befriended two other young men, but neither relationship developed into a lasting partnership.

For a young woman rich in emotions and artistic cultivation, this was a painful setback in her life journey.

It was as if fate had intervened. Last summer, Li Bei, who had been admitted to the Central Conservatory of Music, encountered her old acquaintance Huo at the intersection of Six Ministries in Chang'an Street. By this time, Huo had already settled in Beijing and was working at a research institute with a wife and children. Li Bei, alone, felt a deep sense of loneliness and suddenly felt a surge of affection. They had a long conversation, filled with tender emotions. When they parted, they exchanged addresses and phone numbers, reluctant to say goodbye.

Last October, Li Bei, unable to contain her feelings for Huo, mustered the courage to visit his home, requesting to stay for a few days. Huo's wife, Zhang, was a kind-hearted woman who agreed without hesitation when she learned they were old colleagues.

The young woman's stay at Huo's home sparked rumors among the neighbors. Zhang noticed the hidden truth and, in anger, returned to her parents' home.

Under various pressures, Li Bei had no choice but to move back to the dormitory at the conservatory, but she continued to stay in touch with Huo. Huo also felt he had a "common language" with Li Bei, writing letters, arranging meetings, and sending New Year's greetings, repeatedly expressing his affection.

However, Huo's marriage became a significant obstacle. Li Bei yearned for something she could never have, and her self-confidence and self-control crumbled. In her suicide note, she lamented, "The road ahead is too long, too difficult. Everything I once dreamed of will never appear, and even if it does, I have no right to possess it..." After the Spring Festival, this daughter of a musician finally made the wrong choice.

After Li Bei's suicide, the school authorities discovered some new clues. Li Bei had promised to illegally exchange foreign currency for a friend, but the promise was not kept, and she ended up owing a large debt. So far, it has been discovered that a performer named Wang from the Central People's Broadcasting Station gave Li Bei 36,000 yuan. Li Bei failed to exchange the currency and returned 18,000 yuan to Wang, while 17,400 yuan remains unaccounted for.

In the final days of Li Bei's life, debt collectors frequently visited her, causing her immense mental stress. She hid and evaded, barely attending classes.

Money was the catalyst that drove Li Bei to take her own life.

Li Bei died during this year's winter break. According to regulations, students are not allowed to stay in the dormitories during the break. A few years ago, two students from the Central Conservatory of Music violated this rule and stayed in the school, causing a fire. The lesson was profound. Now, this regulation exists in name only, with no one enforcing it, allowing students to stay in the dormitories during the break. This is a management oversight.

Li Bei had expressed suicidal thoughts multiple times before her death. Some teachers and students had heard her, but they thought she was talking nonsense and did not take her seriously. No one reported it to the school authorities. This is a sign of emotional indifference.

Li Bei's parents are both renowned music professors who raised a daughter with great artistic talent, but they did not pay enough attention to her personal life. As for Huo and Wang, who borrowed money to have Li Bei illegally exchange currency, some were entangled in extramarital affairs, and others dreamed of making "foreign money," ultimately causing a blooming flower to wither prematurely.

It is understood that there are not only Li Bei among the capital's universities who have chosen to end their lives. "Last night's stars have fallen, but tonight's stars still shine." Children of the motherland, take care of yourselves!

　　女研究生李蓓自杀之谜
    本报记者  袁建达
    二月十四日，星期二。三十三岁的中央音乐学院民族音乐理论专业研究生李蓓，服下大量的苯巴比妥，身穿睡衣，躺在学院宿舍里悄然离开人世。
    一位国家花费巨资培养的专业人才，一个风华正茂的女青年，何以要如此轻生？
    李蓓是位容貌清秀、性格内向的女孩子。七年前，她在广西南宁话剧团工作时，与该团一位姓霍的男青年相识。由于工作的变动，两人各奔东西。后来，李蓓又先后与两位男青年交友，但均未成为伴侣。
    对一位感情丰富且不乏艺术修养的姑娘来说，这是人生旅途中难堪的挫折。
    真是无巧不成书。去年夏天的一天，考入中央音乐学院的李蓓在长安街的六部口与旧识霍某相遇。此时的霍某，早已定居北京并在某研究院工作，有了妻儿。李蓓孑然一身，倍感凄凉，顿时生出诸多温情。两人促膝长谈，情意切切。分手时，互换地址、电话号码，简直难分难舍。
    去年十月的一天，李蓓按捺不住思霍之情，大着胆子来到霍家，要求在霍家小住几天。霍妻张某是位贤惠的女人，见他们两人是老同事便满口答应。
    年轻女人住进了霍家，邻居们免不了飞短流长。张某察觉其中隐情后，愤愤然回了娘家。
    在种种压力下，李蓓只好搬回学院宿舍，但与霍某联系不断。霍某也觉得与李蓓有“共同语言”，于是写信、约会、送贺年片，一次次向她表明情思。
    但霍氏的婚姻已成为他们的巨大障碍。李蓓渴望的东西却不可能得到，她的自信心和自制力彻底崩溃了。她在遗书里叹道：“前面的路太长、太难，我曾经幻想过的一切永远不可能出现了，即便出现了，我也没有权利拥有它……”春节过后，这位音乐家之女终于作出了不该作的选择。
    李蓓自杀后，学校当局又发现了一些新的线索，李蓓曾许诺替朋友非法换取外汇，结果诺言没有兑现，倒欠下了一大笔债。到目前为止，已发现中央人民广播电台一位姓王的演奏员交给李蓓三万六千元人民币，李换汇不成，还给王一万八千余元，还有一万七千四百元至今下落不明。
    在李蓓生命最后的一段日子里，债主不断上门逼债，李蓓精神负担沉重。她东躲西藏，几乎没在学校好好读书。
    金钱，是导致李蓓轻生的催化剂。
    李蓓死于今年寒假。按规定，学生在假期不能到宿舍住宿。几年前，中央音乐学院的两位学生违反规定留宿学校，引起一场火灾，教训不可谓不深刻。如今，这项规定名存实亡，学生假期留校无人过问，这是管理上的疏漏。
    李蓓自杀前曾多次表示轻生念头，个别教师、学生也听到过。但她们以为李蓓说胡话，没有认真劝说，更没有人向学校当局反映。这是人情的淡薄。
    李蓓的父母都是颇有声望的音乐教授，他们培养了一个在艺术上很有才华的女儿，但对她的生活却关心不够。至于霍某和凑钱托李蓓非法换汇的王某等人，有的沉迷于婚外恋，有的梦想发“洋财”，终于促使一朵盛开的鲜花过早夭折。
    据了解，首都高校轻生自杀者不止李蓓一人。“昨夜星辰已陨落，今夜星辰依然闪烁。”祖国的骄子们，你们要自重！
