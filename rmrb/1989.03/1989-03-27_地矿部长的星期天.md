The flowers in the capital are in full bloom, and people are out enjoying the scenery. What's more, today is Sunday. Many families in the capital are saying, "Let's go for a spring outing!" However, Minister of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, Zhu Xun, started his day early by visiting the offices of the seven provinces in Ma Dian to see some representatives from the geological community.

The representatives, Li Chongyou, the chief engineer of the Jiangxi Geological and Mineral Resources Survey Team, Professor Zeng Xiaozhen from Changchun Geological Academy, Wang Zhongying, the chief engineer of the Exploration Engineering Research Institute of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, and Dong Xinju, the chief engineer of the Beijing Geological Bureau, were delighted to see the minister. They eagerly offered him a seat and prepared tea.

The Richness of the Country and the "1/2" and "1/4"

The only female representative, Dong Xinju, told Zhu Xun that she sincerely hopes that the country will make conserving, protecting, and rationally utilizing mineral resources a fundamental policy to be adhered to for the long term. She said that in the future, instead of just telling children that "China is rich in resources," we should also tell them that, out of the 45 main mineral resources, China's per capita ownership is only half the world average. China's per capita water resources are only one-fourth of the world average.

Looking at the history and current situation of various countries around the world, the consumption of mineral products grows the fastest when the per capita GDP is between $1,000 and $4,000. Currently, China's demand for mineral products is in a period of rapid growth. We must strengthen geological surveys to achieve significant breakthroughs, while also implementing a resource-saving economy. Otherwise, by the next century, the supply of energy and raw materials will become even more severe.

It's Time to Clean Up the Mess

The representatives suggested that the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources should take the rectification of the mineral industry order as an important task. Last year, by registering mineral exploration projects nationwide, the country avoided over 100 million yuan in repeated geological survey investments. This gave them great encouragement.

Li Chongyou said, "Last year, there were over 1,000 gold mining boats on the Le'an River in Jiangxi. They only sold 15 taels of gold to the state, but it is said that the amount smuggled was around 50,000 taels. If we don't clean this up, how can we manage?"

Zhu Xun nodded and replied, "Relevant departments are drafting the implementation details of the 'Mineral Resources Law' to legalize and standardize the cleanup. The Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources will also quickly dispatch mine inspectors to major mines across the country to promote the rational use of resources."

Seeking Resources Through Reform

Statistics show that 80% of China's mineral deposits contain multiple useful components. One-fourth of copper mines, one-fifth of gold mines, and one-fourth of aluminum mines contain associated minerals. However, a 1986 survey of 1,845 comprehensive mines nationwide found that three-quarters of the mines had a comprehensive utilization rate of less than 2.5%. The phenomenon of mining the main mineral and discarding the associated minerals, or even mining the associated minerals and discarding the main mineral, is shocking.

Wang Zhongying believes that to eliminate waste, we must reform the current mining system and transition from single mining to comprehensive mining. He said, "Coal, bauxite, refractory materials, pyrite, and kaolin often coexist. However, China's mining industry, which is attached to various processing industries, makes the Coal Industry Bureau, Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Bureau, Metallurgical Ministry, Chemical Industry Ministry, and Light Industry Ministry each only mine one type of mineral, while discarding the other four. How can we talk about saving resources? If we establish regional mining companies that mine all five types of minerals and then sell them to the five industrial ministries after sorting, wouldn't that be beneficial for the comprehensive utilization of resources and the improvement of economic benefits?"

As the clock struck 12, Zhu Xun stood up to leave, shaking Wang Zhongying's hand and saying, "Your idea is on the right track!"

　　地矿部长的星期天
    上林花似景，满园看花人。何况今天又是星期日哩。首都多少人家在说：“春游去！”地矿部朱训部长一大早却来到马甸七省驻京办事处，看望一些省市代表团里的地质界人士。
    江西地质矿产调研大队总工程师李崇佑、长春地质学院教授曾孝箴、地矿部探矿工程研究所总工程师汪仲英、北京地矿局总工程师董新菊４位人大代表见部长来了，高兴得又是让座、又是泡茶。
    　　　　地大物博与“１／２”、“１／４”
    ４位代表中的唯一女性——董新菊对朱训说，她衷心希望国家把珍惜、保护和合理利用矿产资源作为一项基本国策长期坚持下去。大家今后对孩子再也不要单讲“中国地大物博”，而应告诉他们，从自然界４５种主要矿产资源来看，中国的人均拥有量只为世界平均水平的１／２。中国人均水资源量只为世界平均水平的１／４。
    从世界各国的历史和现状看，人均国民生产总值在１０００——４０００美元之间时，矿产品的消费量增长最快。我国对矿产品的需求现正处于高速增长时期。我们既要加强地质勘查，力求取得重大突破，又要实行资源节约型经济。否则，到下个世纪，能源和原材料供应将更趋严峻。
    　　　　再不整治怎么得了？
    代表们建议：地矿部应该把整顿矿业秩序作为一项重要工作来抓。去年一抓矿产勘查项目登记，全国就避免了上亿元地勘费的重复投入。这使他们很受鼓舞。
    李崇佑代表说：“我们江西乐安江上去年有１０００多条采金船，交售给国家的黄金只有１５两，据说走私的数目在５万两上下。再不整治怎么得了？”
    朱训点头答道：“有关部门正在拟订《矿产资源法》实施细则，以便整治法律化、规范化。地矿部还将尽快向全国部分大矿派驻矿山督察员，促进资源的合理利用。”
    　　　　向改革要资源
    据统计，我国８０％的矿床伴生多种有用成分，铜矿的１／４、金矿的１／５、铝矿的１／４在伴生共同矿中。然而，１９８６年抽查全国１８４５个综合性矿山的结果却是：３／４的矿山综合利用率不到２．５％。采主弃副甚至采副弃主现象，令人惊心。
    汪仲英代表认为，要杜绝浪费，就必须改革现行的矿业体制，进而变单一开采为综合开采。他说：煤、铝土、耐火材料、硫铁、高岭土５种矿物质往往伴生在一起。而我国矿业依附于各种加工业的现行体制，使煤炭总公司、有色金属总公司、冶金部、化工部、轻工部５家都是只采其中某一种矿物质，而对其余４种弃之不取。所谓节约资源，从何谈起？如果建立区域性的矿业公司，对那５种矿物质都采，筛选后分别出售给那５家工业部门，不就有利于资源的综合利用和经济效益的提高么？”
    时钟指向１２点，朱训在起身告辞时，握着汪仲英的手说：“你的思路对！”
