		Ten Years of Legislation, Remarkable Achievements

		In 1978, the 10 billion Chinese people, from the highest decision-makers to ordinary citizens, were all shaken by the disasters caused by the "lawlessness" of the past decade. Therefore, accelerating legislation and improving the legal system quickly became a priority.

		According to statistics, over the past 10 years, in addition to the current constitution, the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee have enacted 82 laws, passed 20 decisions to amend and supplement laws, and 40 decisions on legal issues. In addition, the State Council has formulated more than 900 administrative regulations, and various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have formulated more than 1,000 local regulations.

		Including the 23 laws enacted in the previous 30 years that have been amended and supplemented, China now has 105 laws covering dozens of areas such as criminal offenses, marriage and family, property inheritance, contract disputes, food hygiene, cultural relics protection, drug management, environmental protection, mineral resources, and forest protection. Therefore, as early as two years ago, a responsible person from the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress announced to the media: "China has already achieved 'rule of law' in the basic and major aspects of political life, economic life, and social life, fundamentally changing the long-term situation of having no law to rely on."

		Rule of Law Does Not Mean Law Enforcement

		A society governed by law requires that all human behavior be regulated. Achieving 'rule of law' in the major aspects of life is certainly not enough. The current problem is that on one hand, there are areas without laws, and on the other hand, the existing laws are not being implemented.

		In July 1983, China's first Food Hygiene Law began trial implementation. The law was promulgated and put into trial, but the production and sale of spoiled food, diseased pork, and contaminated grain are still common. In recent years, the number of food poisoning incidents in Wuhan, Hubei Province, has been on the rise. In 1986, the city had 18 food poisoning incidents, 30 in 1987, and 19 from January to July 1988, with over 600 people poisoned. Wuhan has about 4,100 food production and operation units (excluding unlicensed individual food operators), but there are only 108 food hygiene supervision personnel. Even if each person inspects and supervises one unit per day, it would take a year to cover each unit once.

		The "Land Management Law of the People's Republic of China" came into effect on January 1, 1987. Before the implementation of the land law in 1985, 23 million mu of arable land was reduced in one year, and 16 million mu in 1986. In 1987, after the implementation of the "Land Management Law," 12 million mu of land was still reduced. Currently, China's per capita arable land is less than 1.4 mu, less than half of the 2.7 mu per capita in 1949, and less than one-third of the world average. Among the 26 countries with a population of over 50 million, China's per capita arable land is ranked third from the bottom. A land management official said, "We have the 'Land Management Law,' but enforcing the law is even more difficult than legislating. Many leaders still do not truly realize that the land issue is threatening our survival, which is even more dangerous than the warning signals from the land itself."

		The "Forest Law" was one of the earliest laws promulgated in the past 10 years. However, since its trial implementation in February 1979, illegal logging and looting of timber in the south have not been effectively stopped. In 1987, a major forest fire in the Great Khingan Mountains burned 855,000 cubic meters of timber in storage and damaged 39.6 million cubic meters of timber. According to a forestry department official, according to the provisions of the "Forest Law," the consumption of timber should be less than the growth rate, so the national annual logging quota is set at 156 million cubic meters, and the forestry department's logging permit is also over 100 million cubic meters. However, in reality, China consumes about 350 million cubic meters of timber each year. The nearly 200 million cubic meters of timber logged without permits include state-owned, collective, and individual logging, and the amount of timber logged beyond the quota by state-owned forestry enterprises in the north is greater than the amount of illegal logging in the south.

		A county-level leader in Jiangxi said at a three-level cadre meeting in a certain county, "Your county is a county that eats wood. Industry uses wood as raw material, and farmers make a living by logging. To develop the economy and enrich the people, we need to prioritize logging. What 'Forest Law,' you don't need to worry about so much." The words of this leader are quite representative.

		China currently has 500 nationally key cultural relics protection units, 62 national historical and cultural cities, and more than 3,400 provincial-level cultural relics protection units. In November 1982, China promulgated and implemented the first "Cultural Relics Protection Law." Over the past six years, the achievements in cultural relics protection have been far from satisfactory. On August 30 last year, Minister of Culture Wang Meng reported to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the implementation of the "Cultural Relics Protection Law," saying, "According to incomplete statistics for 1987, cultural relics and museum units nationwide had a total of 86 theft cases, with 885 cultural relics stolen. The crime rate increased by 77% compared to 1986, and the number of stolen cultural relics doubled. Some provincial cultural relics management departments have only three or four people, and many counties do not have cultural relics institutions or full-time cultural relics personnel."

		The Root Cause

		Regarding the enforcement of China's current laws, someone made a pessimistic estimate: only 20% of the laws have been implemented. Although there are different opinions in the legal community about the accuracy of this estimate, it is generally agreed that there is currently a widespread problem of 'law not being enforced.' As for the reasons for this phenomenon, opinions vary.

		Some people believe that the current laws themselves are not perfect, with some regulations being too general and difficult to enforce; some laws conflict with each other, causing departments to shift blame; some do not specify penalties, or do not align with criminal law, resulting in weak deterrence.

		Wei Yaorong, Director of the Economic Law Division of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, believes that while the above problems exist, they are not the main reasons for 'law not being enforced.' The main reasons are that law enforcement agencies do not strictly enforce the law, and even violate the law themselves. Government departments and leaders at all levels ignore the law, and even openly violate the law or protect and condone illegal behavior. For example, after the "Land Law" was promulgated, most of the illegal land occupation cases were caused by some cadres illegally approving land and leading the way to build houses. Once the leader sets an example, illegal land occupation can quickly become a trend.

		Wei Yaorong said that another important reason is that some departments treat the law as a tool to constrain others, and sometimes use it to "punish" people, but when it is not needed, they put it aside and rarely think about their own obligation to act in accordance with the law.

		Zhao Wei, a staff member of the Supervision and Inspection Bureau of the State Council's Legislative Affairs Office, has another perspective on the causes of the 'law not being enforced,' 'law enforcement not being strict,' and 'law violations not being investigated.' He believes that the root cause of some departments' law enforcement personnel violating laws and regulations, and leaders replacing laws with words and using power to suppress laws, is a problem of personal quality, which should be solved through the system. A typical example is that many management departments now employ temporary workers to maintain operations, and these people rely on management fees for their livelihood, which objectively makes it impossible for them to ensure fair law enforcement.

		Zhao Wei believes that our legislative institutions are now relatively complete, and supervisory institutions cannot be said to be absent, but their functions have not been fully utilized. Sometimes, local governments also conduct law enforcement inspections, but they often fall into the "campaign-style" rut. Currently, government supervisory departments mainly supervise from the perspective of discipline rather than from the perspective of law.

		Many departments and individuals equate strengthening the legal system with "quick legislation," as if once a law is enacted, the job is done. This easily reminds one of a question raised by a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress: "What is our legislation for? Is it for people to look at, or is it for people to follow and enforce?"

### 关键在于严格执法——改革十年立法与执法述评

    十年立法，成果显赫。尽管法制还不健全，但更多见的是有法不依而不是裁决无据——
    关键在于严格执法
    ——改革十年立法与执法述评
    本报记者　苏宁
    　　　　大量立法的十年
    １９７８年，刚刚从恶梦中醒来的１０亿中国人，从最高决策者到普通老百姓，无一不为十年浩劫中“无法无天”所造成的灾难所震颤。于是，加快立法、完善法制很快被提上了议事日程。
    据统计，１０年来，除现行宪法外，全国人大及其常委会共制定了８２个法律，通过了２０个修改、补充法律的决定和４０个有关法律问题的决定。此外，国务院制定了９００多个行政法规，各省、自治区、直辖市制定了１０００多个地方性法规。
    加上经过修改、补充的前３０年制定的２３个法律，我国已有１０５个法律，覆盖了刑事犯罪、婚姻家庭、财产继承、合同纠纷、食品卫生、文物保护、药品管理、环境保护、矿产资源、森林保护等几十个领域。因此，早在两年前，全国人大常委会法制工作委员会一位负责人就向新闻界宣告：“我国在政治生活、经济生活、社会生活的基本的、主要的方面已经是有法可依了，过去那种长期无法可依的状况得到了根本的改变。”
    　　　　有法可依不等于有法必依
    法治社会要求人们的一切行为都有规范，仅在生活的主要方面做到有法可依，当然是远远不够的。现在的问题是：一方面存在无法可依，另一方面现有的法律却得不到贯彻实施。
    １９８３年７月，我国第一部食品卫生法开始试行。法律是颁布试行了，但是，生产销售变质食品、出售病害猪肉、被污染粮食等现象仍随处可见。湖北省武汉市近年来食物中毒事件持续上升，１９８６年全市发生食物中毒事件１８起，１９８７年发生３０起，１９８８年１—７月，全市发生食物中毒事件１９起，中毒人数６００余人。武汉市食品生产经营单位约有４１００多家（不包括无证经营的个体饮食户），而食品卫生监督人员只有１０８人。即使每人每天检查监督一个单位，一年也不能把每个单位跑一遍。
    １９８７年１月１日，《中华人民共和国土地管理法》开始实行。在土地法实施前的１９８５年，一年减少耕地２３００多万亩，１９８６年减少１６００多万亩；实施《土地管理法》后的１９８７年，土地仍减少了１２００万亩。现在我国人均占有耕地不到１．４亩，比１９４９年的人均２．７亩少了近一半，不及世界人均数的１／３。在全世界２６个人口在５０００万以上的国家中，我国人均耕地占有量排倒数第３位。一位土地管理干部说：“我们虽然有了《土地管理法》，但执法比立法还难。许多领导干部至今没有真正感到土地问题已经威胁到我们的生存，这比土地本身给我们发出的危险信号还要危险。”
    《森林法》是这１０年中最早颁布的一个法律。但从１９７９年２月公布试行以来，南方乱砍滥伐、哄抢林木事件却始终未能得到有效的制止。１９８７年大兴安岭一场森林大火，又烧掉了贮木场存材８５．５万立方米，过火受害林木３９６０万立方米。据林业部的同志介绍，按照《森林法》的规定，用材林的消耗量必须低于生长量，因此国家规定的年采伐限额是１．５６亿立方米，林业部门发证采伐数也是一亿多立方米，但是实际上每年全国消耗木材３．５亿立方米左右。无证采伐这近两亿立方米木材的，国营、集体、个人都有，而北方国营森工企业突破限额滥伐林木的数量，要大于南方乱砍滥伐量。
    江西一位地委领导在某县一次三级干部会上说，“你们这个县是吃木头的县，工业以木头为原料，农民以砍木头为生。经济要上去，农民要富裕，就是要砍字当头。什么森林法，你们不要管那么多。”这位领导的话，具有不小的代表性。
    我国现有全国重点文物保护单位５００处，国家级历史文化名城６２座，省级重点文物保护单位３４００余处。１９８２年１１月，我国公布实施了第一部《文物保护法》。６年多来，文物保护工作的成绩却不尽如人意。去年８月３０日，文化部部长王蒙在全国人大常委会上报告《文物保护法》实施情况时说：“据１９８７年不完全统计，全国文物博物馆单位共发生盗失案件８６起，被盗文物８８５件，发案率比１９８６年上升７７％，文物被盗数上升１倍。有的省文物主管部门只有三四个人，相当多的地县没有文物机构和专职文物干部。”
    　　　　症结究竟在哪里
    对我国现有法律的执行情况，曾有人作过一个悲观的估计：仅有２０％的法律得到了贯彻实施。尽管对这个估计是否准确，法律界有不同意见，但是，目前普遍存在有法不依，这是大家认同的。至于造成这一现象的原因，则又众说纷纭。
    有人认为现有的法律本身不够完备，有的规定得过于原则，不便执行；有的法律之间互相矛盾，造成部门之间推诿扯皮；有的没有规定具体罚则，或与刑法不衔接，威慑力量不大。
    全国人大常委会法制工作委员会经济法室主任魏耀荣则认为，上述问题是存在，但并不是造成有法不依的主要原因。执法部门不严格执法，甚至自己就不遵守法律，政府主管部门，各级领导机关无视法律，甚至公然违法或包庇纵容违法行为，这才是造成有法不依的主要原因。比如《土地法》公布以后，大部分群众滥占土地的现象得到了制止，现在滥占土地案件，主要是一些干部非法批地、带头占地盖房造成的。一个地方只要领导开了头，滥占土地就容易迅速成风。
    魏耀荣说，还有一个重要原因：有的部门把法律视为工具，用以约束别人，甚至有时候拿起来“治”人，不需要时束之高阁，很少想到自己也有依法办事的义务。
    国务院法制局监督检查司干部赵威，对造成有法不依、执法不严、违法不究现象的原因，又有一番见解。他认为目前存在的有些部门执法人员违法乱纪，领导干部以言代法、以权压法等，说到底是人的素质问题，应从制度上加以解决。典型的例子是现在不少管理部门雇佣临时工维持工作，而这些人靠收管理费养活，这从客观上就无法保证他们能够做到公正执法。
    赵威认为，我们的立法机构现已比较健全，监督机构也不能说没有，但职能却没有很好发挥。有的地方有时也进行执法大检查，但往往不脱于“运动式”的窠臼。现在的政府监察部门主要是从政纪的角度，而不是从法律的角度进行监督。
    许多部门、许多人把加强法制等同于“快快立法”，似乎法一立出来，就大功告成。这容易使人联想起一次人大常委会上，一位委员发出的疑问：“我们立法到底是干什么用的？是供人看的，还是让人遵守执行的？”
