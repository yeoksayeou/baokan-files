	China's tight transportation situation has a major cause – prioritizing heavy industry over transportation and logistics over transportation. The emphasis on heavy industry and neglect of transportation has been a long-standing issue. After the founding of the People's Republic, we entered a phase of planned large-scale economic construction. At that time, we did not truly understand the need to transition from small-scale production to large-scale socialized production, where transportation must take the lead. As a result, since the second five-year plan, transportation has become increasingly strained. Additionally, for a long time, we have one-sidedly used output value as a key indicator of economic development. Building factories yields high output, quick results, and significant achievements, while building transportation infrastructure, especially railways, requires large investments, long cycles, and slow returns. It takes three to five years to see any results. Therefore, from top to bottom, there is more enthusiasm for building factories than for developing transportation and railways. This mindset of prioritizing heavy industry over transportation must change if we are to solve transportation problems.

	Prioritizing logistics over transportation. In the past, under the centralized planning system and product economy, the problem was not so pronounced. Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, we have begun to develop a planned commodity economy. With the reforms, opening up, and activation, the traditional production, supply, and sales structure has already or is undergoing new changes. There is a surge in the movement of people and goods, and there are new quantitative and qualitative demands for accelerating passenger transportation and material movement. Therefore, in the first round of developing a commodity economy, transportation has been entirely passive. The facts also fully prove that in recent years, people have found it inconvenient to travel, and goods have not flowed smoothly. Currently, the average turnover of working capital in China is 90 days, which is three times that of developed countries. If we shorten this by one day, we can save over 4 billion yuan. Such gains and losses seem to be something we rarely consider. We compare why Western transportation has developed early and well. The key is that they have always practiced a market economy. They instinctively know that without good transportation, goods cannot be quickly moved and exchanged, and products lack competitiveness and cannot make money. In short, there is a basic formula for commodity economy: product + transportation = commodity. Our commodity awareness is still weak. We only talk about logistics and do not talk about transportation. This mindset must change if we are to solve transportation problems.

	Updating our mindset should be the priority. Now, the entire society, especially our decision-makers, need to deepen their understanding of the strategic position of transportation. It should be said that the current full-scale tension in railway transportation is a punishment for our long-term neglect of the economic law that transportation must take the lead.

### 我国交通运输紧张的一个重要原因——重工业轻交通  重流通轻交通

　　我国交通运输紧张的一个重要原因——        
    重工业轻交通  重流通轻交通
    俞国栋（中国交通运输协会副会长兼秘书长）重工业、轻交通，由来已久，建国以后，我们进入有计划的大规模经济建设，那时我们没有真正懂得从小生产转入社会化大生产，交通运输必须先行一步，以致从第二个五年计划以后交通运输日益紧张。加上我们长期以来又一直片面地把产值作为衡量经济发展的重要指标。办工业，产值高、见效快、“成绩大”；而办交通特别是修铁路，投资大、周期长、见效慢，三年两年是看不到“成绩”的。所以，从上到下，办工厂有积极性，办交通、修铁路往往不那么积极。这种重工业、轻交通的思想不转变，交通运输问题是难以解决的。
    重流通、轻交通。在过去集中计划体制下搞产品经济的那些年代，问题还不很突出。十一届三中全会以来，我们开始转到发展有计划的商品经济，随着改革、开放、搞活，传统的产、供、销格局已经或正在发生新的变化，人流、物流大量涌现，而且对加速旅客运送、加速物资移动提出崭新的量和质的要求。因此，在发展商品经济的第一回合，交通运输完全处于被动地位。事实也充分证明，这些年人不便其行、货不畅其流，我国目前流动资金周转一次平均为九十天，是发达国家的三倍，如果缩短一天就可减少四十多亿元。像这种效益得失，我们似乎是很少考虑到的。我们对比西方交通运输为什么上得早、搞得好。重要的是他们一直搞市场经济，他们本能地深知，不搞好交通，商品无法快速位移、交流，产品就缺乏竞争力，就赚不到钱。说穿了，搞商品经济有一个起码的公式就是：产品＋交通＝商品。我们现在商品观念还不强，只讲流通，不讲交通，这种思想不转变，交通运输问题也是难以解决的。
    观念的更新应该是先导，现在需要全社会，首先是我们的决策者，进一步深化对交通运输战略地位的认识。应该说，今天铁路运输出现的全面紧张，是对我们长期忽视交通先行这个经济规律的惩罚。
