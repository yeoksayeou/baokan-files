	South Korean Youth to Attend in Pyongyang

	New China News Agency, Pyongyang, March 8 – Seoul: South Korea will send approximately 300 university students to participate in the 13th World Youth Festival to be held in Pyongyang this July.

	This news was reported by the United Press on the 7th, quoting a South Korean official responsible for student exchanges between the North and South. The official said that since North Korea is the host of this festival, the number of students invited from the South might be relatively high.

	The invitation from North Korea was specifically addressed to the university student organization "National University Student Representatives Council." The North does not want the Seoul authorities to interfere in this matter. The official, who belongs to the government-sponsored "South-North University Student Exchange Promotion Committee," said they would accept most of the demands from the "National University Student Representatives Council."

    南朝鲜三百青年将赴平壤
    新华社平壤３月８日电  汉城消息：南朝鲜将派约３００名大学生参加今年７月在平壤举行的第１３届世界青年联欢节。
    这一消息是联合通讯社７日援引一位负责南北方学生交流问题的南朝鲜官员的话报道的。这位官员说，由于朝鲜北方是这次联欢节的东道主，所以邀请南方大学生的人数可能比较多。
    朝鲜北方向南方发出的邀请是专给大学生团体“全国大学生代表协议会”的。北方不希望汉城当局干涉这件事。这位属于具有官办色彩的“南北大学生交流促进委员会”的官员说，他们将接受“全国大学生代表协议会”的大部分要求。
