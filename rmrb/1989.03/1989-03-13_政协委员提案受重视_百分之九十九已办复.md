Since the first session of the Seventh Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), 77.9% of the members have submitted 2,005 proposals, fully reflecting the strong sense of political participation among CPPCC members. The implementation of these proposals has played an active role in promoting China's economic construction, improving government work, enhancing the democratization and scientific nature of national decision-making, and rectifying party discipline and combating bureaucratism.

Over the past year, members have focused on the current central tasks and issues of widespread concern to the people, conducted in-depth investigations and research at the grassroots level, and made constructive suggestions and criticisms on issues such as agriculture, education, prices, and party discipline. By March 6, 1989, relevant departments had addressed 1,985 proposals, accounting for 99% of the total submitted. Of these, 28% have been adopted by relevant departments, are being implemented, or are in the process of being implemented; 62% are being studied for resolution or are planned to be included in future plans; and 10% could not be resolved due to immature conditions or other reasons.

　　政协委员提案受重视  百分之九十九已办复
    本报北京３月１２日讯  记者晓渡报道：政协七届一次会议以来，有７７．９％的委员提出了２００５件提案，充分反映了政协委员强烈的参政意识。提案的落实对发展我国经济建设，改进政府工作，提高国家决策的民主化和科学化水平，对端正党风和克服官僚主义等，都起了积极作用。
    一年来，委员们围绕当前的中心任务和人民群众普遍关心的问题，深入基层，调查研究，围绕农业问题、教育问题、物价问题和党风问题等，中肯地提出批评和意见，积极参政议政。到１９８９年３月６日，有关部门已办复提案１９８５件，占所提提案的９９％。已得到有关部门采纳，基本落实和正在落实的，占已办复提案的２８％；有关单位正在研究解决或准备纳入规划的，占已办复提案的６２％；因条件尚不成熟或其他原因未能解决的，占已办复提案的１０％。
