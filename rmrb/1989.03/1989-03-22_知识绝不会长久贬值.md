Knowledge Will Never Devalue for Long

	Wuhan University School of Journalism  Chen Qiuzhong

	At a time when knowledge is devalued and there is a trend of disdain for learning in universities, I, at the age of 26, still insist on taking the college entrance examination and was admitted. When I was about to leave my original workplace to go to university, although there were supporters around me, there were even more people who did not understand. The reason I made this choice without hesitation is that I do not believe that the devaluation of knowledge will last long.

	Respecting knowledge and respecting talent is the hope of a country and a nation, and it is also the trend of the times, which no one can stop. During the Cultural Revolution, knowledge was artificially devalued and intellectuals were despised, but this was eventually corrected. Now, although there is a phenomenon of "reading big books to earn little money and reading small books to earn big money," this devaluation of knowledge and unfair distribution is not something the highest decision-making level intentionally does, but rather a result of policy imbalances in the process of developing a commodity economy. This is fundamentally different from the devaluation of knowledge during the Cultural Revolution. Now, the development of the commodity economy is in a state of disorderly "chaos." Once the adjustment knob is found, the devaluation of knowledge and the "new theory of the uselessness of reading" will be reversed.

	Moreover, what is currently devalued is only the aspect of knowledge that can be represented by money, or what can be called price; the value of knowledge that cannot be measured by money will never devalue. If a person possesses a wealth of knowledge, he may produce major scientific research achievements. Although wealthy people can buy products converted from scientific research results, they cannot enjoy the joy of creation, nor will they be as admired by the world as the creator. Similarly, when facing a work of art, a person who is rich but lacks knowledge can only watch the spectacle, while a person who possesses a wealth of knowledge can appreciate the refined aesthetic experience; the more knowledge one has, the richer one's life will be, and no matter how much money an ignorant person has, it will still be empty and boring.

	My views are not some unique and strange opinions. In the university I am in, there are many people who share my views. They have given up more than I have for the sake of studying, and the price they have paid is also greater.

### 知识绝不会长久贬值

专栏：我看“新的读书无用论”

　　知识绝不会长久贬值
    武汉大学新闻系  陈秋中
    在知识贬值、大学里厌学风四起的时候，已经２６岁的我却还要固执地去考大学，并且考上了。当我要离开原单位上大学时，虽然周围不乏支持者，但更多的人却不理解。我之所以毫不犹豫作出这种选择，是因为我并不认为知识贬值会长久存在。
    尊重知识、尊重人才，是一个国家、一个民族的希望之所在，也是时代的大潮，谁也阻拦不了。“文革”期间人为地轻视知识、鄙视知识分子，最后还是被扭转过来了。现在虽然出现了“读大书赚小钱、读小书赚大钱”的现象，但这种知识贬值、分配不公毕竟不是最高决策层有意所为，而是在发展商品经济过程中政策出现了失衡所致。这和“文革”期间的知识贬值情况有着本质的不同。现在，商品经济发展正处在一个无序的“混沌”状态，一旦找到调整旋钮，知识贬值、“新的读书无用论”就会扭转。
    另外，现在知识贬值的只是它可用金钱表现的那方面使用价值，或者称之为价格；知识中无法用金钱衡量的价值永远也不会贬值。如果一个人拥有了丰富的知识，他可能搞出重大科研成果，有钱的人虽然可以买到科研成果转换成的产品，但他却无法享受创造的欢乐，更不会像创造者那样为世人所爱戴。同样面对着一个艺术品，有钱而缺乏知识的人仅仅是看看热闹而已，而拥有丰富知识的人却可以看到高雅的审美感受；知识愈多，人的生活就愈充实，而无知的人钱再多也空虚无聊。
    我的这些看法，并非什么独树一帜的奇异观点，我所在的大学里就有不少人和我的见解相同。他们为了读书，失去的比我更多，付出的代价也更大。
