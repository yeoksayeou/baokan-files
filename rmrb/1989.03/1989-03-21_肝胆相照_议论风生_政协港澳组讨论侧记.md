Open Hearts and Freewheeling Debate
– A Record of the CPPCC Hong Kong and Macau Group Discussion

One person once confided to the reporter his concern: This "Two Sessions," the discussion might be a bit dull. On the morning of March 20, when the reporter rushed to the Friendship Hotel CPPCC Hong Kong and Macau Group, the discussion had already begun.

Xu Simin, a member known as the "Big Gun" in Hong Kong, was the first to "fire." He said, "I heard that a member's wife is afraid he will 'cause trouble' by speaking out, and does not 'approve' him coming to the meeting. She even said that if he doesn't listen to her advice, she will divorce him." Xu Simin said, "Of course, this is a joke. My wife hasn't proposed a divorce, but she did tell me to speak less, but she hasn't given me an 'ultimatum.' So I still came."

Frank, sincere, the "Big Gun" style remains unchanged.

Entrepreneur Tang Xiangqian spoke about how to fulfill the responsibility of democratic supervision. He believes that to truly achieve mutual trust and shared honor and disgrace, one should play the role of supervision by the CPPCC, supervising the government and officials. He said, "Some members dare to speak, and their wives threaten divorce. I don't have this pressure. My wife is quite democratic and doesn't have this problem, but I have many enterprises in the mainland. If the relationship with the leadership is not good (laughter), I am really afraid of being harassed." (Another round of laughter)

Sitting to his right, the group's convener Zheng Hua interjected with a smile, "You are not afraid of your wife, but you are afraid of your enterprises." Tang, amidst the laughter, added, "But I still want to be bolder and speak out the problems!"

As the members took turns eagerly speaking, Li Ziyong, sitting in the convener's seat, was writing vigorously on a piece of paper: "Unity in diversity, convergence in differences, no need to fear disagreements, no need to fear controversies. From controversy to eliminate disagreements, from disagreements to achieve unity. Such unity is true unity."

Li Ziyong talked about the CPPCC's inspection work. He said that in the past, CPPCC members inspected various places, listened more, had more banquets, and saw less. He suggested that in the future, inspection work should involve more on-site investigations. To save costs and time, banquets should not be held, and working meals should be eaten.

Gu Maoji finally got the chance to speak, and it was "considerate." He said, "Today's meeting is very lively, and I am very satisfied. The views on democracy mentioned by everyone here, I also agree with. Promoting democracy, letting everyone speak freely, and putting forward opinions, can only invigorate the spirit." He added, "Even if criticism deviates from the facts, it doesn't matter, 'Those who hear it will be cautious'!" He turned to Tang Xiangqian, smiling, "I ask Mr. Tang to rest assured, you have raised issues, and you won't be 'given a hard time' because of it." He then turned to Xu Simin sitting opposite, "You also don't have to be afraid of your wife 'divorcing' you, you raise issues, it is for the progress of the country, and should be supported!"

Xu Simin corrected with a smile, "She didn't propose a divorce, she just advised me to speak less."

The members and reporters burst into laughter.

　　肝胆相照　议论风生        
    ——政协港澳组讨论侧记
    本报记者  张何平
    一位人士曾向记者吐露他的忧虑：这次“两会”，讨论也许会比较沉闷。２０日上午，当记者赶到友谊宾馆政协港澳组时，讨论已经开始。
    在香港有“大炮”之称的徐四民委员，率先开“炮”。他说，听说有个委员的老伴怕他“乱”讲话，惹麻烦，“不批准”他来与会，并说，如不听劝，将同他离婚。徐四民说：“当然，这是玩笑话了。我的老伴虽未提出离婚，也叫我少讲话，但还未发‘最后通牒’。所以我还是来了。”
    直率、坦诚，“大炮”风格依旧。
    企业家唐翔千委员谈怎样发挥民主监督的职责。他认为，要真正做到肝胆相照、荣辱与共，就应该发挥政协的监督作用，监督政府，监督干部。他说：“有的委员敢讲话，老婆要离婚。我没有这个压力。我的老婆比较民主，没有这个问题，但我在国内有不少企业，假如同领导方面的关系搞得不好（笑声），倒是很怕刁难。”（又是一阵笑声）
    坐在他右边的小组召集人郑华委员笑着插话：“你是不怕老婆，怕企业。”唐委员在笑声中补充说：“不过，我还是想胆子大一些，把问题讲出来！”
    在委员们轮番抢着发言时，坐在召集人座位上的李子诵委员在纸上奋笔疾书：“一致而百虑，同归而殊途，不必怕分歧，不必怕争议。从争议以消除分歧，从分歧而达一致。这样的一致，才是真正的一致。”
    李子诵委员谈到政协视察工作。他说，以往政协委员视察各地，听的多，应酬多，看的少。他建议，今后视察工作要多看，多做实地调查。为节约费用和时间，不要设宴会，要吃工作餐。
    谷牧委员好容易才轮到发言机会，还是“照顾”的。他说：“今天的会开得很活跃，我很满意。会上大家提到的有关民主的一些观点，我也赞成。发扬民主，让大家畅所欲言，把意见讲出来，才能振奋精神。”他又说：“批评即使与事实有出入也没关系，‘闻者足戒’嘛！”他转向唐翔千委员，含笑说：“我请唐先生放心，你提了意见，不会因此给你‘穿小鞋’。”他又转向对面而坐的徐四民委员：“你也不要怕老伴‘离婚’，你提意见，是为国家进步，应该支持！”
    徐四民委员笑着，纠正说：“她没有提出离婚，只是劝我少讲话。”
    众委员、记者一片笑声。
