An eight-year-old child won a lawsuit against two companies, which were ordered to pay compensation. The People's Court of Lanshan County recently heard a civil case where a six-year-old child sued the Taiping Lead Mine for compensation for damages. The court ruled that the two companies should bear civil liability.

On March 23, 1986, the plaintiff Li Qian (then 6 years old) and two other children under the age of 7 were playing in the Taiping Lead Mine area. Li Qian climbed onto a transformer and was electrocuted by high voltage, immediately sent to the hospital for emergency treatment. The medical expenses amounted to over 1,700 yuan, and other expenses were over 300 yuan. The mine only agreed to reimburse 45% of the medical expenses, and the rest had to be borne by the injured person. The plaintiff, dissatisfied, filed a lawsuit with the court.

The court held that the plaintiff Li Qian was only 6 years old at the time of the accident, according to the provisions of the "Civil Law," he is a person without civil capacity, and he cannot bear civil liability for climbing onto the transformer and being electrocuted. The Taiping Lead Mine should bear civil liability. The transformer that injured Li Qian was installed by the Lanshan County Water and Electricity Management Bureau, and it was handed over for use without meeting the safety standards for electrical use, so it should bear some civil liability.

The People's Court of Lanshan County ruled: The Taiping Lead Mine shall compensate the plaintiff for medical, travel, and other expenses amounting to 2,000 yuan, and a disability living allowance of 6,000 yuan. The Lanshan County Water and Electricity Management Bureau shall compensate the plaintiff for a disability living allowance of 1,000 yuan.

　　八岁儿童打官司胜诉　两家企业被裁定赔款
    本报讯  湖南省蓝山县人民法院近期审理了一起八岁儿童告蓝山县太平铅矿损害赔偿的民事案件，裁定两家企业分别承担民事责任。
    １９８６年３月２３日，原告李谦（当时６岁）与两名不满７岁的小孩在太平铅矿区内玩耍。李谦爬上变压器，被高压电击伤，当即被送往医院抢救，共花费医疗费１７００余元，其他费用３００余元，而该矿只准报销医疗费４５％，其它由伤者自理。原告不服，遂投诉法院。
    法院认为，原告李谦在发生事故时仅６岁，依照《民法通则》规定，系无民事行为能力人，他爬上变压器被高压电击伤致残，本人不能承担民事责任，太平铅矿应承担民事责任。击伤李谦的变压器是蓝山县水电管理所负责安装的，又在没有达到安全用电的技术要求时交付使用，因而应承担一定的民事责任。
    蓝山县人民法院依法判处：太平铅矿赔偿原告医疗、车旅等费用２０００元，伤残生活补助费６０００元，蓝山县水电管理所赔偿原告伤残生活补助费１０００元。
