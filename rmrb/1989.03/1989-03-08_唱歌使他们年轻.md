Before liberation, universities such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, Nankai University, and the Franco-Chinese University, under the leadership of the underground party, all had progressive student-organized choirs that were at the forefront of student movements. In 1980, to commemorate the 45th anniversary of the December 9th Movement, over 200 former choir members performed a poetry chorus at the Great Hall of the People. This was originally intended to be a one-time performance. However, after the performance, everyone was reluctant to disperse and insisted on continuing to sing, vowing to sing until the year 2000, or until they could no longer sing! Thus, the Beijing Old Classmates Chorus was formally established.

Over the past eight years, the Old Classmates Chorus has grown from 200 members to nearly 600. The majority are former members of university choirs from before liberation, and in recent years, some university students from the 1950s have also been accepted, with an average age exceeding 60, and the oldest being 74. They are scattered across various workplaces, and some have already retired. Regardless of the weather, they persist in gathering twice a month for rehearsals, singing revolutionary songs from before liberation, as well as famous songs from China and abroad, and even songs they have created or adapted themselves. They are active on Beijing's musical stage, having performed over 60 times, and are frequent guests at colleges and universities, as well as in activities with middle school students and the Young Pioneers.

There are some incredible stories within the Old Classmates Chorus. One member, who lives in Tianjin, has insisted on traveling from Tianjin to Beijing every month for eight years to participate in rehearsals and performances. She is Chu Da Jiang from the Tianjin Institute of Social Sciences. Chu Da Jiang was a member of the Beida Star Sea Chorus before liberation. Most of the members of the Old Classmates Chorus were her comrades in arms during her youth, sharing the same ideals, passions, hopes, and pursuits. Later, they all experienced similar hardships. In the 1980s, they reunited. Although time had passed and they had all turned from youth to old age, they still maintained the sincerity and friendship of their younger days.

Another member of the Old Classmates Chorus, Shi Yu Qing from the State Economic Commission's Education Bureau, continued to participate in chorus activities even after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage and becoming hemiplegic. She believes that life cannot be without song. As the chorus's anthem says, "The song makes us younger and younger." Two years after her illness, when she could not walk, her husband and children would take her to rehearsals on a tricycle. Singing made her happy and helped her recover her health. Now, she has thrown away her crutches and, with the help and support of her chorus comrades, can take the bus to participate in activities.

One of the main reasons the Old Classmates Chorus has remained vibrant for so long is the dedication of a group of enthusiastic organizers. They were all leaders of university choirs from before liberation and active participants in student movements. The general secretary, Fang Kun, was originally the dean of the Central Conservatory of Music and the conductor of Tsinghua's "Everyone Sings." Now, the work of the Old Classmates Chorus has become an important part of his retired life. The deputy general secretary and researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Liu Qing Hua, is the only male lead singer in the chorus. For eight years, all the song sheets of the chorus have been handwritten, printed, and bound by him.

　　唱歌使他们年轻
    林竹君
    解放前，北大、清华、南开、中法等大学，在地下党的领导下，都有由进步学生组织的合唱团，挺进在学生运动的前列。１９８０年，纪念“一二·九”４５周年，原合唱团团员２００多人，在人大会堂演出了诗歌联唱。这本来是一次临时演出。然而，演出结束后，大家却不肯散了，要求继续唱下去，一直唱到２０００年！唱到不能唱的时间为止！北京老同学合唱团乃正式成立。
    ８年来，老同学合唱团已由２００多人发展到近６００人。绝大部分是解放前各大学合唱团的成员，近年来也接纳了部分５０年代的大学生，平均年龄超过６０岁，最大的７４岁。他们分散在不同的工作岗位，有的已经离退休。不论严寒酷暑，他们坚持每月集中排练两次，既唱解放前的革命歌曲，也唱中外名曲，还唱自己创作、改编的歌曲。他们活跃在北京的歌坛，演出了６０余次，是大专院校的常客，也与中学生、少先队联欢。
    老同学合唱团里有些事说出来都有点令人难以相信。有一位团员家住天津，８年来，她坚持每月两次由天津赶到北京参加排练和演出活动。她就是天津社会科学院的楚大江。楚大江解放前是北大星海合唱团的成员。老同学合唱团的成员，大部分是她年轻时共同战斗过的伙伴，有过共同的理想、激情、渴望和追求。后来，也大都有过类似的坎坷遭遇。到８０年代大家重又相聚了。尽管岁月无情，都已红颜变白发，但仍保持当年的友情和真诚。
    老同学合唱团另一位团员——国家经委教育局的石宇清，在身患脑血栓、半身不遂后，仍坚持参加合唱活动。她认为生活中不能没有歌声。正如老同学合唱团团歌歌词中所说的：“歌声使我们越活越年轻”。两年前患病后，不能行走，她的老伴和孩子就登三轮车送她来参加练唱。唱歌使她心情愉快，促使她日渐恢复健康。现在，她已扔掉双拐，在合唱团同志的照顾和扶持下，能自己坐公共汽车来参加活动。
    老同学合唱团经久不衰的一个很重要的原因，在于有一批十分热心的干事。他们都是解放前北大、清华等大学合唱团的负责人，学运中的积极分子。总干事方坤，原中央音乐学院教务长，当年清华“大家唱”的指挥。现在，老同学合唱团的工作已成为他离休生活的重要内容。副总干事、中国社会科学院副研究员刘青华是团内唯一男声领唱人，八年来，合唱团所有歌片都是他一手刻写、油印和装订的。
