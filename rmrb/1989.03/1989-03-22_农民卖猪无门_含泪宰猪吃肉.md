Title: Farmers Struggle to Sell Pigs, End Up Eating Them Themselves

I am a genuine farmer. Last year, I worked hard to raise two pigs, hoping to sell them for some money. However, the government did not purchase them, and the market was controlled by "pig speculators." Now, they sell pork at 5 to 6 yuan per kilogram, while the purchase price for live pigs is only 3.5 yuan per kilogram. Even at this price, many farmers still cannot sell their pigs. Who would have thought that raising two pigs would plunge my entire family into difficulty!

Raising pigs is hard, selling pigs is hard, and even eating meat is hard. Only the "pig speculators" are happy. Insiders say that for every 150-kilogram pig bought and slaughtered, the speculators can make a profit of 100 to 200 yuan. It's truly the case that "farmers suffer a year, not as profitable as speculators make in half a day." Some farmers, unable to bear it, have slaughtered their pigs and eaten the meat with tears in their eyes.

　　农民卖猪无门        
    含泪宰猪吃肉
    我是一个地地道道的农民，去年费尽心机把两头猪养大，指望卖点钱，但公家不收购，市场全由“猪倒爷”操纵。现在，他们将每公斤的猪肉卖到五六元，而把毛猪收购价压到每公斤３．５元。就是这个价，不少农民的毛猪还是卖不也去。万万没有料到，我养了两头猪，却使全家陷入了困境！
    养猪难，卖猪难，吃肉也难，只有“猪倒爷”是乐呵呵的。知情人说，收宰一头重１５０公斤左右的毛猪，“倒爷”可获利一二百元，真是“农户苦一年，不如‘倒爷’倒半天”。有的农户忍痛宰了猪，含泪吃猪肉。
