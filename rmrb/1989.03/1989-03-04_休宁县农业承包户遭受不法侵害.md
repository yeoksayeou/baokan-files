In recent years, relevant departments in Xuning County, Anhui, have handled more than ten cases where the legal rights of agricultural contract holders have been infringed upon. These illegal acts have caused the contract holders to suffer losses totaling over 470,000 yuan.

These illegal acts have taken the following forms:

1. Mob looting. In March 1987, farmer Yu Guoxing from Lantian Township's Niukeng Village contracted 604 mu of a township-run forest farm. He invested over 3,000 yuan that year. In April 1988, over 700 people went to his contracted mountain to dig up 2,500 kg of fresh bamboo shoots, causing Yu Guoxing a loss of over 4,000 yuan. His 150 mu of newly planted fir saplings were also destroyed by one-third. In 1985, farmers Wu Peigen and Cheng Youzhang from Lihuantian Township's Liqian Village contracted the Liqian Reservoir for fish farming. They released 10,000 fish fry that year. In March 1988, several hundred people looted fresh fish, causing the contractors a loss of over 180,000 yuan.

2. Theft. Farmers Cheng Benfa and others from Chaokou Township contracted a fish pond. Over two years, all the fish they raised were stolen.

3. Breach of contract. Bingtan Township's Jiankou Village's Wuming Team decided to contract the team-run tea factory to villagers Zhang Xinping and others. Seeing that Zhang Xinping's contracted tea factory made a profit of over 100,000 yuan in 1988, the team cadres proposed not to fulfill the contract. In 1985, farmworker Shao Lihua from the county's horticultural farm contracted 111 peach trees and 4.7 mu of tea garden. The family devoted themselves to the contracted land, increasing investment, fertilizing, and spraying pesticides, and even planted 99 more peach trees. However, in less than two years, the farm unilaterally tore up the contract, reclaiming Shao Lihua's contracted orchard and tea garden, and gave her a pear orchard overgrown with weeds instead. Shao Lihua appealed to relevant departments over 20 times, but to no avail. In the end, she drank a bottle of DDT and died in the office of the county horticultural farm.

4. Poisoning for revenge. Cheng Shengyang, the village head of Houdian Village, Chaokou Township, contracted a pond for fish farming. Cheng was upright and fair, daring to catch and manage those who broke the law, thus offending some people. In 1987, someone poisoned his entire pond of fish with pesticides.

The main reasons for these illegal acts are:

1. Contracting without bidding, with village cadres making the decisions. Some forest farms, tea gardens, ponds, and reservoirs were contracted without public bidding but were instead decided by village cadres. Some contractors paid low fees, causing dissatisfaction among people. Some who did not get the contract said, "The tea garden was planted by us, if he can contract it, I can too; if he can pick the tea, I can too." Others said, "The reservoir was built by the entire township, catching a few fish to eat shouldn't be a crime." Due to the unfairness in contracting, some who did not get the contract were disgruntled, leading to frequent incidents of theft and looting.

2. Some people do not understand the law or disregard it. Many village cadres only know that signing a contract is legal, but do not understand that changing or terminating a contract must be agreed upon by both parties, and even less understand that unilateral breach of contract incurs legal responsibility. Some villagers secretly steal or openly loot the tea leaves, bamboo shoots, and fresh fish of contract holders, and even refuse to cooperate with law enforcement. For example, after the police station in Yanqian Town issued summonses for those who looted the contract holder's tea leaves, some not only did not come but also tore up the summons in front of the person delivering it. Almost all township heads reflected: now, the township government is powerless, and can only persuade and educate lawbreakers. If they don't listen, there is nothing we can do. It is suggested that relevant departments strengthen the construction of spiritual civilization and legal system education, improve people's moral standards and legal awareness. In addition, in the future, whenever collective tea farms, reservoirs, ponds, etc., need to be contracted, democracy should be practiced, and public bidding should be conducted to prevent monopolization. For already signed contracts that need to be changed, consultation should be conducted to resolve issues, and they should not be arbitrarily changed or torn up.

Relevant departments should also promptly handle illegal acts according to law and should not be lenient. Various levels of government should attach importance to and vigorously promote the certification system, making the contract content and both parties' rights and obligations true and legal, preventing and avoiding fraud. If this is done, when harm and disputes occur, the harmed party will be able to seek help from certification agencies to resolve problems.

### 休宁县农业承包户遭受不法侵害

　　休宁县农业承包户遭受不法侵害
    近年来，安徽休宁县有关部门受理了十几起农业承包户合法权益遭受侵害的案件，这些不法侵害使承包户损失４．７万多元。
    这些不法侵害有以下几种方式：
    一是哄抢。兰田乡扭坑村农民余国兴１９８７年３月承包６０４亩乡办林场。他当年投资３０００多元。１９８８年４月，有７００多人次到他承包的山上挖鲜笋２５００多公斤，余国兴损失４０００多元，他当年新栽的１５０亩杉树苗，有１／３被毁。首村乡里环田村农民吴培根、程有章１９８５年承包里环田水库养鱼，当年投放鱼苗１万尾，１９８８年３月，几百人哄抢鲜鱼，承包人损失１．８万多元。
    二是偷窃。汊口乡程本发等农户承包一口鱼塘，两年来，喂养的鱼都被偷光。
    三是违约。冰潭乡碜口村五明队决定将队办制茶厂承包给村民张新平等人。队干部看到张新平承包的制茶厂１９８８年获利１万多元，便提出不履行合同。县园艺场农工邵丽华１９８５年承包了１１１株桃树、４．７亩茶园，一家人一心扑在承包地里，增加投入，施肥喷药，还新栽了９９棵桃树。但是，不到两年，场方单方面撕毁合同，收回邵丽华承包的果园、茶园，另分给她一块荒草丛生的梨园。邵丽华先后２０多次找有关部门交涉，但毫无结果。最后，她喝下滴滴畏，死在县园艺场场部办公室。
    四是投毒报复。汊口乡后田村村长程胜阳承包一口水塘养鱼。程为人正派，办事公道，对有违法行为的人敢抓敢管，因此得罪了一些人。１９８７年有人投农药将他的一塘鱼全部毒死。
    不法侵害的主要原因是：
    一、承包不搞招标，村干部说了算。有些林场、茶园、水塘和人工水库被承包时，不是公开招标，而是由村干部包办。有的承包人上缴金额低，人们不服。有的没承包上的人说，茶园是我们出工栽的，他能承包我也能承包，他能采我也能摘；有的则说，水库是全乡人修的，捞几条鱼吃还犯得了法。由于承包中的不公平，一些没承包上的人有情绪，因此，不断发生暗偷明抢事件。
    二、一些人不懂法或者无视法律。不少村干部只知道签订合同是依法办事。不懂得变更、解除合同也必须双方协商，更不懂单方违约要负法律责任。有的村民暗偷、明抢承包户的茶叶、竹笋、鲜鱼，甚至拒绝执法机关的讯问。如岩前镇派出所对哄抢承包户茶叶的人发出传票后，有的不仅不来，还当着送传票的人把传票撕碎。几乎所有的乡镇长反映：现在，乡政府赤手空“权”，对违法人员只有说服教育。人家不听也毫无办法。建议有关部门加强精神文明建设和法制的宣传，提高人们道德水准和法制观念。此外，今后凡是集体的茶场、水库、水塘等需要承包时，要发扬民主，公开招标，防止包办。已签订的承包合同需要变更时，要协商解决，不得随意更改、撕毁。
    有关部门还应及时地依法处理不法侵害事件，决不能手软。各级政府要重视和大力推行公证制度，使合同内容和双方权利义务真实、合法，防止和避免弄虚作假。这样做了，发生侵害和纠纷后，被侵害方就会找公证机关帮助解决问题。
