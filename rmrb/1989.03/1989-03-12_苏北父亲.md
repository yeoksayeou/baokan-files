Family Portrait

I am from Hunan, and both of my biological parents are from Hunan. However, I have a father from Northern Jiangsu who is even closer to me than my biological father.

My father and I did not know each other and had no blood relation or any familial connection. In the winter of 1979, he came to Chengbu—a remote county in Hunan—for work. In the hotel where he stayed, he found me. At that time, I was only 13 years old. Since my biological parents divorced when I was born, I had been living with the help of relatives and the government. This little boy, struggling in the cold wind and rain, who longed for his parents but couldn't find them, unexpectedly formed an unbreakable bond with him on a winter morning.

My father is a supply and marketing cooperative worker, frequently traveling between Jiangsu and Hunan. Every time he came to Hunan, the first thing he did was to visit me at school. Over time, my teachers and classmates all knew him, and he always entrusted the teachers to take care of me before leaving. From the year he adopted me until today, my father has supported me through high school and the university I am about to graduate from in just four months. It can be said that my teenage years were spent under the care of my Northern Jiangsu father.

He has two sons around my age, and now we have become close brothers. The year I was admitted to university, I heard my father tell his two sons, "I want to cultivate your brother to go to university. In the future, you should save money. Your brother had a tough childhood, and now that he has been admitted to university, he should be able to study without any worries."

My father is generous. I remember once, when one of my university classmates went to Chengbu for an internship, he met my Northern Jiangsu father before returning to school. My father immediately asked the classmate to bring 300 yuan and instructed, "Take care of Xiaogang's health and study hard. If you need anything, just write a letter back."

I love my Northern Jiangsu father—Jiangsu Province Hai'an County Caoyuan Commercial General Store salesman, a very ordinary name: Hong Shiyi.

　　苏北父亲
    我是湖南人，生身父母都在湖南，但却有一个比生身父亲还亲的苏北父亲。
    父亲和我本不相识，也无半点血亲或任何亲属方面的关系。１９７９年冬他出差来城步——一个偏僻的湖南小县城，在他住下的旅店里发现了我。那年我才１３岁。自出生那年生身父母离异后，多年来我都是靠着亲戚和政府的照顾生活的。我这个在凄风苦雨中挣扎的小人儿，一个想爸爸妈妈而不得的可怜儿，没想到就这样在一个冬日的早晨与他结成了牢不可破的亲情关系。
    父亲是一位供销人员，经常往来于江苏与湖南之间。每次父亲来湖南时，首先做的事情便是到学校看我。时间久了，老师和同学都认识了他，而他每次离校都要托咐老师照看我。从收养我的那年一直到今天，父亲供我念完了中学和现在只差四个月就要毕业的大学。可以说我的青少年时代就是在苏北父亲的养育下过来的。
    他自己有两个和我差不多同龄的男孩子，现在我们已成了亲密的兄弟。我刚考进大学那年，曾听父亲对自己的两个孩子说：“我要培养你们的哥哥上大学，以后你们要节约点。哥哥从小环境不好，现在考上大学，应该让他没什么牵挂地去念大学。”父亲是慷慨的，记得有一次我的大学同学去城步实习，返校前见到了我的苏北父亲。父亲立即托同学带来３００元钱，并嘱咐同学：“要小刚注意身体，好好学习，需要什么就写信回来。”
    我爱我的苏北父亲——江苏省海安县曹园商业总店推销员，一个很普通的名字：洪诗义。
