The sky gradually darkened, and the ferry to the city still hadn't appeared. Standing on the beach, impatiently waiting, we began to look around to distract ourselves. Sure enough, we spotted a girl not far away, washing vegetables in the water. A vegetable pole was placed nearby. In the twilight, we could vaguely see that there was something else in the pole.

"Are these the vegetables you didn't sell?" I struck up a conversation. The area around here is inhabited by suburban vegetable farmers, so I guessed she had just returned from selling vegetables in the city.

"No, ah, not." The girl turned her head to glance at us briefly, not stopping her vegetable washing. "I bought them."

"Bought them? But you just sold vegetables. Why buy more?"

The girl smiled, "Different varieties." Her answer was concise. Of course, we understood. We all chuckled in agreement. She was washing a vegetable with deep green small leaves, commonly known as Western vegetable, but I don't know its scientific name. This vegetable has a complex flavor, and many people like it.

"What else did you buy?" The ferry still hadn't shown up, so we had plenty of time to chat. I pointed to the vegetable pole.

"Camellia!" "Camellia?" The girl's answer somehow made all of us pause, our attention immediately focused on the vegetable pole.

Indeed, there was a pot of camellia about a foot high. Plump leaves supported a pink flower. Due to the darkening sky, it was hard to tell if the flower was pale yellow or pink.

"How much?"

"20 yuan."

"And how much did you earn from selling vegetables today?"

"About 10 yuan today." The girl's clothes were very simple. Her posture while washing vegetables was both rustic and graceful, without any affectation.

This truly surprised us. 20 yuan for a pot of flowers, a rural girl selling vegetables, the two seemed hard to connect.

"Isn't that too expensive?" The words slipped out before I realized it might sound rude, but fortunately, the girl didn't seem to mind.

"Like it, so buy it. The camellia is from Yunnan, the transportation cost is worth it." I didn't expect her to know so much.

I bent down to take another look at the camellia. In the vast twilight, I saw the flower slightly open its layers of petals, smiling but not smiling, perhaps because of the long journey, it looked a bit tired, slightly lowering its head. I had seen many camellias, but I couldn't say what variety this was. Fish blood red? Four-sided brocade? Rose camellia? No, no, something that could make a rural girl spend all her money to buy must not be ordinary. I had seen a pair of dirty and messy tea crystal carved wall lamps hanging in a poor rural home, which was very out of place. I knew that in rural areas, the habit of displaying wealth was not something like this. The answer to my question was still: "Like it."

Ah, like it.

The girl walked away, gradually disappearing. The camellia smiled, everything became blurred, merging into the elusive night.

　　暮色中的山茶
    李志
    天渐渐黑下来，四城的轮渡还未见影子。站在沙滩上等得不耐烦的我们，眼睛开始向四下里搜寻，免得怨气溢出。果然看到不远处有个女孩，站在水里洗菜。一副菜挑子放在近旁。暮色里隐约觉得挑子里还有一棵什么。
    “这是你卖剩下的菜？”我搭讪着。这周围住的都是郊区的菜农，估计她也是刚从城里卖菜回来的。
    “啊？不。”女孩侧过头来不经意地看了我们一眼，没有停下洗菜的动作。“买的。”
    “买的？你不是刚卖菜吗？有菜卖怎么还要买？”
    女孩笑了，“品种不同。”回答得很简洁。当然我们也明白了，大家都附和地笑了笑。她正洗着的是长着深绿色小叶子的菜，俗称西洋菜，学名不知叫什么。这种菜味道复杂，不少人喜欢。
    “还买了什么呢？”轮渡尚未有踪影，有的是时间，继续扯扯也无妨。我指了指菜担。
    “茶花！”“茶花？”女孩的回答不知怎么使得我们几个都触动了一下，注意力不由全集中到菜担那儿。
    果然是一盆一尺余高的茶花。肥肥团团的叶子托起一朵粉色的花。由于天色已暗，难以分辨这花的颜色是淡黄还是粉红。
    “多少钱？”
    “２０元。”
    “那你卖菜收入多少？”
    “今天１０元左右。”女孩的衣装很朴素。洗菜的姿态既朴实又优美，丝毫没有矫揉做作的意味。
    这着实使我们吃惊。２０块一盆花，一个农村卖菜的女孩子，两者似乎难扯到一块。
    “这么贵你也舍得？”这话说出口了才觉得有点不好意思，幸亏那女孩并不介意。
    “喜欢就买。茶花从云南来，运费也值了。”没想到她还知道得不少。
    我俯下身，又仔细看看那棵山茶花。苍茫的暮霭中只见这花微微张开重重叠叠的花瓣，似笑非笑，也许因为远途而归，略显疲劳，微低着头。我见过的茶花不少，却说不上这是什么品种，鱼血红？四面锦？玫瑰茶？不，不，能够使一个农家姑娘倾囊而购的一定不是等闲之辈。我见过一个脏乱的农家赫然而挂的一对茶晶镂花壁灯，与周围极不协调，我知道在农村显示富贵的习惯绝不是这种东西。回答我的疑问又是：“喜欢。”
    啊，喜欢。
    女孩走了，渐渐远了，茶花含笑，一切都模糊了，没入了难以捉摸的夜色之中。
