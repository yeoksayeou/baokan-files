Recently, we conducted a survey of graduating students from several universities in Liaoning Province. We found that with the changes in political and economic situations, the concept of a commodity economy has greatly influenced college students' outlook on life and values. This year's graduates have shown a more "pragmatic" attitude towards career choices compared to previous years.

From Aspiring to Big Cities, Large Organizations, and Big Enterprises to Choosing Medium-Sized Cities and Medium-Sized Enterprises

This year, the allocation plan has increased the proportion of students going to grassroots levels, and most students will be assigned to these areas. Although most students feel that the allocation plan is not ideal, they believe that working at the grassroots level after graduation is a direction for development. Some students think: big places are full of talented people, and there are few opportunities for oneself to make a difference; going to a place where there is no room to showcase one's talents and becoming a "runner" or "errand boy" will lead to the neglect of one's profession after a few years. Others think: large organizations and enterprises do not lack people, and after graduation, one's living requirements will not be taken seriously, while small places are different. A student from Shenyang Pharmaceutical College said: "If we want to go to the Northeast Pharmaceutical Factory, we have to start as a general worker in the workshop, and we don't know how many years we will have to work before we can engage in research; if we go to a medium-sized pharmaceutical factory, we can achieve results in a few years." A student from Agricultural University said: "Large units only have a good reputation, but there is no autonomy in work, which is not conducive to personal development and the display of talents."

The Passion for Politics Fades, the Idea of Engaging in Professional Work Gradually Strengthens

Students with strong professional backgrounds all hope to be assigned to units that match their professions and engage in professional and technical work. They believe that with the deepening of political system reforms, the path to politics will become narrower, while professional work is more stable. A student from Northeast Institute of Technology said: "In a society with a developed commodity economy, the idea of power supremacy will gradually fade away. As China's political democratization process continues, the civil servant system will be implemented, and there will be no lifelong guarantee for being an official. Only by engaging in professional work and showcasing one's strengths can one hold onto an iron rice bowl." Some students said: from the current situation, the country encourages us to engage in professional and technical work. After the professional title evaluation system is in place, the status of professional and technical work will continue to improve, and there will be more opportunities for promotion. It will be easier to obtain a mid-level professional title than to become a section-level official, and the path to economic income will be broader. Some students said that if there is no matching professional work, they would rather be self-employed and start their own businesses.

Dependence on Family Leads Many Students to Want to Return to Their Hometowns

Some graduates will be assigned back to their hometowns. Although this is caused by various objective conditions, students have gradually become proactive in their attitudes. Some graduates summarized the four advantages of returning to their hometowns: first, returning to the hometown gives them the opportunity to choose their workplace. A student from Shenyang Industrial University said: "My family is in Dandong City. After being assigned to Dandong, my family can help me get a relatively ideal job through acquaintances. If I stay in Shenyang, I will have no choice in my workplace." Second, they can receive help in their work. Some students think that going to a foreign place means being unfamiliar with everything, and they will be at a loss when encountering problems. In their hometown, if their family has some influence, it will become a favorable condition for their development. Third, they can receive financial support from their family. A student from Shenyang Industrial University said that the monthly salary of a college graduate is over 70 yuan, and after going to a foreign place to work, there will be little left after eating. At home, they don't have to worry about clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Fourth, the housing problem is easier to solve. Students generally feel that after work, they have to consider getting married and starting a family, and the biggest difficulty is housing. Now, there are few units that can provide housing upon marriage, and returning home to rely on parents is much easier.

    大学生择业的三个热点
    共青团中央研究室 　苏丽　王建中
    最近，我们对辽宁省部分高校应届毕业生进行了调查，发现随着政治经济形势的变化，商品经济观念对大学生人生观和价值观念产生了巨大的影响，今年毕业生在择业问题上较之往年突出了“务实”的倾向。
    由向往大城市、大机关、大企业转向去中小城市和中小企业
    今年的分配计划到基层的比例增大，大多数学生将被分配到基层。绝大多数学生虽然感到分配方案不理想，但又认为大学毕业后到基层工作是发展方向。一些学生认为：大地方人才济济，自己发挥作用的机会很少，到一个没有用武之地当“跑腿的”或“打杂的”，几年后专业就荒废了；还有的认为：大机关、大企业不那么缺人，毕业去了之后自己在生活上的要求得不到重视，而小地方则大不一样。沈阳药学院一学生说：“如果我们想去东北制药厂，就得先在车间当一般工人，并且还不知要干多少年，根本谈不到搞科研；如果去一个中小制药厂，几年就能出成绩”。农大一名学生说：“大单位只是名声好，工作起来一点自主性也没有，不利于自身发展和施展才华。”
    从政热淡化，从事专业工作思想逐步强化
    专业性强的学生都希望被分配到专业对口的单位，从事专业技术工作。他们认为，随着政治体制改革的深入，从政之路将越来越窄，相反专业工作较为稳定。东北工学院一学生说：“在商品经济发达的社会，权力至上观念将逐步被淡化，随着我国政治民主化进程的不断加快，公务员制度实行，当官没有终身制做保障了，只有靠搞专业、发挥自己的特长才能抓住铁饭碗。”还有的学生说：从现在的形势看，国家是鼓励我们从事专业技术工作的，专业职称评定走上正轨之后，从事专业技术工作的地位将不断提高，晋级的机会会越来越多，评中级职称要比当个处级干部容易得多，经济收入的路子也广。也有的学生说，如果没有对口专业工作，宁愿当个体户，自己创办企业经营。
    对家庭的依赖导致一大批学生要求回家乡
    一部分毕业生将要分回自己的家乡。这虽然是由各种客观条件造成的，但学生在主观上已由被动逐渐变为主动。一些毕业生总结了回家乡的四大好处：一是回家乡对工作单位有选择的余地。沈阳工业大学有的学生说：“我家在丹东市内，分配回丹东后，家里可以通过熟人把我分配到一个较为理想的单位。如果留在沈阳，工作单位就没有选择的余地了。”二是以后在工作上能得到关照。有的学生认为，去外地人生地不熟，遇事两眼漆黑。在家乡就不同了，如果家里有点势力，还会成为自己发展的一个有利条件。三是经济上能得到家里资助。沈阳工业大学一学生说，大学毕业生的工资每月70多元钱，在外地工作去了吃饭就所剩无几了，在家里衣食住行都不用自己管。四是房子问题易解决。学生们普遍感到，工作后就得考虑结婚成家，最大的困难是房子，而现在结婚就能给房子的单位很少，回家依靠父母就好办多了。
