To combat the rat problem, the New York City Parks Department has decided to place wooden boxes in four parks this spring, allowing owls, natural predators of rats, to "settle down and thrive."

Rat infestations are considered a long-standing problem in human civilization that is difficult to solve. It is estimated that there are currently hundreds of thousands of rats in New York City. In Central Park, rats even dare to follow and chase park workers. The U.S. federal government has confirmed that rats have developed increasing resistance to drugs, and long-term use of anticoagulant rodenticides is no longer effective.

Currently, the United States has successfully implemented a plan to artificially breed owls to control rats in national forest parks. Inspired by this, New York plans to install 25 plywood boxes in the first batch, each costing $3–7. These artificial nests will be placed on trees, with each able to accommodate 4–6 owls. Relevant officials have stated that they will reduce the use of rodenticides, and if the experiment is successful, they will further promote this method.

　　纽约为猫头鹰安“家”
    本报华盛顿３月１２日电  记者仓立德报道：为了对付鼠害，纽约市公园管理部门决定今春在市内４个公园里放置木箱，使老鼠的天敌猫头鹰能在这里“安居乐业”。
    鼠害被视为人类文明社会长期难以解决的一个难题。据估计，纽约市目前有上百万只老鼠。在中央公园，老鼠竟敢尾随追逐公园职工。美国联邦政府已经证实，老鼠体内的抗药性越来越强，长期使用的抗血凝毒鼠药已难以奏效。
    美国目前在国家森林公园人工招养猫头鹰灭鼠的计划已获得成功。受此启发，纽约打算第一批安置２５只胶合板木箱，每只造价３—７美元。这种人造窝将架在树上，每个可容纳４—６只猫头鹰。有关人士表示，他们将减少使用灭鼠药，一旦试验获得成功，他们将进一步推广这一作法。
