	Mitterrand Meets Latin American Finance Ministers
	Western Seven Nations' Leaders Should Prioritize Debt Discussion

	Paris, March 24 (Reported by Zhang Qihua) — Following the United States' announcement of the "Brady Plan" two weeks ago, France has also reiterated its concern over the global debt issue.

	Yesterday, President Mitterrand met with finance ministers and bankers from 18 Latin American countries at the Élysée Palace. He stated that France will urge the seven-nation summit to be held in Paris in July to prioritize the discussion on the debt issue.

	By the end of 1988, Latin American countries (primarily Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, and Peru) had borrowed a total of 132 billion francs from French banks.

	Mitterrand reiterated France's proposal made last September to ensure the implementation of debt reduction plans for third-world countries. This proposal involves establishing a guarantee fund, with its composition being special drawing rights, and its management being placed under a multilateral framework, such as the International Monetary Fund's Board of Governors.

　　密特朗会见拉美国家财长       
    西方七国首脑应优先讨论债务
    本报巴黎３月２４日电  记者张启华报道：在美国两周前宣布“布雷迪计划”后，法国也重申它对世界债务问题的关注。
    昨天密特朗总统在爱丽舍宫会见拉美１８个国家的财长及银行家时表示，法国将要求今年７月在巴黎召开的七国首脑会议优先讨论债务问题。
    至１９８８年年底，拉美国家（主要是巴西、墨西哥、委内瑞拉、阿根廷和秘鲁）向法国银行贷款已达１３２０亿法郎。
    密特朗重申了法国去年９月为保证实施削减第三世界国家债务诸方案而提出的建议，即建立一项保证基金，其构成为特别提款权，而其管理则被置于一多边范围内，如国际货币基金组织理事会。
