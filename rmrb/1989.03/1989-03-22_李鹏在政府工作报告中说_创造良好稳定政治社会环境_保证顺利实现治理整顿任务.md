Li Peng, in his government work report, said that fully leveraging political advantages and striving to create a good and stable political and social environment is an important guarantee for the smooth implementation of the rectification and adjustment task.

Li Peng said that during the period of economic rectification and adjustment, we must further strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and socialist legal system, safeguard the democratic rights of the broad masses of the people, adhere to and improve the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, give full play to the role of democratic parties, non-party patriotic personages and mass organizations in political consultation and democratic supervision, strengthen the construction of grassroots political power organizations in urban and rural areas, and consolidate and develop a political situation of stability, unity, democracy, and harmony. Any social turmoil and chaos are not conducive to the conduct of construction and reform, seriously harm the fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities across the country, and go against the wishes of the broad masses.

He said that we must carry out in-depth legal education to enhance the people's legal awareness. On the basis of implementing the Constitution and various laws, we will improve administrative regulations and systems, and strictly enforce the law. All levels of government and departments must take the lead in observing laws and regulations, and at the same time support and supervise the judicial administrative departments to exercise their powers in accordance with the law. Through strengthening democratic supervision and law enforcement work, we will uphold political discipline and state laws, severely punish criminals who seriously disrupt the economy, and resolutely crack down on and severely punish criminals who seriously endanger social order. We will resolutely crack down on criminal gangs, prostitution, and human trafficking. He said that all levels of government should mobilize and organize the strength of the broad masses, implement comprehensive management, strengthen social order, and jointly maintain a good production order, work order, study order, and life order.

    创造良好稳定政治社会环境   
    保证顺利实现治理整顿任务
    新华社北京３月２１日电  李鹏总理在政府工作报告中说，充分发挥政治优势，努力创造良好的稳定的政治和社会环境，是顺利实现治理整顿任务的重要保证。
    李鹏说，在经济上进行治理整顿期间，我们要进一步加强社会主义民主和社会主义法制建设，保障广大人民群众的民主权利，坚持和完善共产党领导的多党合作制度和政治协商制度，充分发挥民主党派、无党派爱国人士和群众团体的参政议政、民主监督作用，加强城乡基层政权组织建设，巩固和发展安定、团结、民主、和谐的政治局面。任何社会动荡和混乱都不利于建设和改革的进行，严重损害全国各族人民的根本利益，是违背广大群众的心愿的。
    他说，要深入进行普法教育，增加人民的法制观念。在贯彻宪法和各项法律的基础上，完善行政法规和制度，并严格执法。各级政府和各部门必须带头遵纪守法，同时从各方面支持和监督司法行政部门依法行使职权。通过加强民主监督和执法工作，维护政纪国法，严厉惩处严重破坏经济的犯罪分子，坚决打击和依法从重从快惩处严重危害社会治安的犯罪分子。坚决打击流氓团伙和卖淫嫖娼、贩卖人口等犯罪行为。他说，各级政府要动员和组织广大群众的力量，实行综合治理，强化社会治安，共同维护良好的生产秩序、工作秩序、学习秩序和生活秩序。
