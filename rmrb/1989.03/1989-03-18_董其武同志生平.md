Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 17th.

The great patriot, loyal soldier of the Chinese Communist Party, senior commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, outstanding military strategist, and Vice Chairman of the Sixth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Comrade Dong Qiuwu, passed away in Beijing at 13:55 on March 3, 1989, due to illness. He was 90 years old.

Comrade Dong Qiuwu was born on November 27, 1899 (October 25 in the lunar calendar) in a poor peasant family in Hejin County, Shanxi Province. In his early years, influenced by bourgeois democratic revolutionary ideas, he vowed to save the country and the people. In 1919, he went to Taiyuan to enroll in the Military Academy (also known as Binye Middle School). In 1924, he joined the Second Army of Hu Jingying, beginning his military career, serving as platoon leader, company leader, battalion leader, and deputy chief of staff of the 9th Mixed Brigade. In 1927, he participated in the Northern Expedition, serving as the commander of the vanguard brigade of the Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army, fighting in Henan and Anhui. In the fall of 1928, he went to Tianjin to join Fu Zuoyi's troops, serving as a captain, lieutenant, and platoon leader of the Political Training School for Cadres. In April 1930, he served as deputy regiment commander and regiment commander, and in 1931, he became the commander of the 35th Division, stationed in the south of Suiyuan.

After the September 18th Incident in 1931, Comrade Dong Qiuwu supported the Chinese Communist Party's correct proposal of "opposing civil war and uniting to resist Japan," with a strong sense of national duty, actively participating in the anti-Japanese national war. Facing the aggressive actions of Japanese imperialism, he wrote to General Fu Zuoyi, requesting to go to Northeast China to resist the invaders, and at the same time, led his troops to prepare for battle, ready to fight at any moment. In mid-May 1933, he led his troops to participate in the "Great Wall War," blocking the enemy in Huairou and Shiguan, leading all officers and soldiers to fight bravely, repelling more than ten fierce attacks by the Japanese invaders, until the signing of the humiliating Tanggu Truce Agreement, when they were forced to withdraw from the battlefield. In 1936, he served as the commander of the 218th Brigade. In the "Suiyuan War" under the command of General Fu Zuoyi, he led his troops to move quickly, taking the enemy by surprise and attacking from multiple directions, annihilating the Japanese puppet forces in Honggeertu, laying the foundation for the victory of the Battle of Bai Ling Temple, and was praised as an "anti-Japanese national hero." After the July 7th Incident, he led his troops to fight in the Ping-Sui line, and later, in close cooperation with the Eighth Route Army, participated in the famous Battle of Pingxingguan and the Battle of Xinkou. He led 3,000 elite troops deep into the enemy's territory, sustaining heavy injuries, and continued to command a surprise attack on the forward command post of the Hata Division, achieving brilliant results. By the end of 1937, he served as the commander of the 101st Division, fighting in the northwest of Shanxi, and met leaders of the Eighth Route Army such as He Long, Nan Hanchen, and Cheng Zihua, strengthening his belief in cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. In 1938, he led his troops to participate in the "Suiyuan War." By the end of the year, he returned to the Suiyuan region with General Fu Zuoyi, reorganizing and training the troops, and seizing opportunities to fight against the Japanese. In the winter of 1939, he led his troops to participate in the "Baotou Battle," the "Suiyuan Western Battle," and the "Wuyuan Battle," fighting continuously for more than 100 days, achieving three victories, heavily striking the arrogance of the Japanese invaders, and boosting the anti-Japanese spirit of the Chinese nation. From 1940 onwards, he successively served as the commander of the Provisional Third Army, the Fourth Cavalry Army, the 35th Army, and the Political Department of the 12th War Zone, and the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Jin-Shan-Sui Border Region, consistently fighting against the Japanese.

By the end of 1946, he served as the Chairman of the Kuomintang Suiyuan Provincial Government and the Commander of the Suiyuan Security Command. Later, he also served as the Deputy Commander of the Northwest Military and Political Commission. During this period, he insisted on supporting peaceful and democratic political proposals, actively expanding production, managing the Yellow River, improving people's livelihood, promoting education, and strengthening Mongol-Han unity. In January 1949, after the peaceful liberation of Beiping, he assessed the situation and resolutely accepted the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's proposal to resolve the Suiyuan issue peacefully. With the help of General Fu Zuoyi, he overcame numerous obstacles and, on September 19, 1949, led the military and political personnel of Suiyuan to issue a proclamation of uprising, creating the famous "Suiyuan Method" at that time. He accepted the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, making significant contributions to the peaceful liberation of Suiyuan and the founding of New China, helping the People's Liberation Army to concentrate its forces to defeat the remnants of the Kuomintang, and quickly liberating the entire country. His great achievements in the Suiyuan uprising will be forever recorded in history.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Dong Qiuwu was appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the Suiyuan Military and Political Commission, the Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government, the Deputy Commander of the Suiyuan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, and the Commander of the 23rd Army Corps. During this period, he did not disappoint the expectations of the Central Committee of the Party, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De for him to "actively pursue progress, strive to reform old systems, implement new policies, and realize the liberation army and local liberation area, building a new Suiyuan for the people." Under the care and guidance of Commander-in-Chief Nie Rongzhen and Political Commissar Bo Yibo of the North China Military Region, he actively united military and political personnel, seriously rectified social order, suppressed bandit rebellions, severely punished lawbreakers, and protected the safety of people's lives and property, doing his utmost to stabilize the situation in Suiyuan. In 1951, he led his troops to fight in Korea, serving as the Commander of the 23rd Army Corps of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, fearlessly facing hardships and sacrifices, and successfully completing military engineering construction tasks under tight time and heavy responsibilities. He advocated revolutionary heroism and international communism, contributing to the resistance against American aggression and the defense of the motherland. The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea awarded him the Second Class Order of Freedom and Independence.

After 1953, Comrade Dong Qiuwu served as the Commander of the 69th Army of the People's Liberation Army, dedicating himself to the modernization and regularization of the army. He organized troops to conduct live-fire exercises and demonstration exercises for the entire army, leading the troops to successfully complete military training, national defense construction, and production tasks. In 1963, when Hebei Province suffered a major flood, he personally commanded the flood relief and rescue efforts. He was democratic in style, exemplary in action, highly respected, and deeply loved by the broad masses of soldiers. He insisted on strict military discipline, striving to strengthen the regularization of the troops, and received high praise from the Central Military Commission. In 1973, he accompanied the Chinese government delegation to visit Japan, contributing to the development of friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan. He served as a representative of the First, Second, and Third National People's Congresses, a member of the Standing Committee of the Fourth and Fifth National People's Congresses, a member of the Law Committee, a member of the Constitutional Amendment Committee, a member of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and a member of the Standing Committee of the Third and Fourth National Committees, a Vice Chairman of the Fifth and Sixth National Committees, and a member of the First and Second National Defense Committees. In 1955, he was awarded the rank of Senior General and received the First Class Liberation Medal. In 1988, he was awarded the Victory Medal of Honor.

During the ten years of turmoil, he deeply detested the counter-revolutionary actions of the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing clique, worried about the future of the country, the army, and the people, and deeply sympathized with many old cadres who suffered persecution. He also disregarded his personal safety to care for them and their children. After the Gang of Four was smashed, he firmly believed in the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, sincerely supported and resolutely implemented the line, principles, and policies of the Party's Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. He visited factories, rural areas, schools, and military units many times, conducted investigations and research, and made suggestions for reform and opening up. At the same time, he was diligent and responsible in implementing the policy for those who surrendered and joined the uprising, helping many people to be rehabilitated and vindicated, strengthening their trust in the Party, and maintaining the Party's prestige among the people. He worked hard to open up a new situation for the work of the Political Consultative Conference. He actively promoted the cause of national reunification, supporting the Party Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal of "one country, two systems," frequently publishing articles and speeches, hoping to achieve national reunification as soon as possible, and having a great impact both domestically and internationally.

Comrade Dong Qiuwu, through his personal experiences, witnessed the development and changes of Chinese society and the great achievements of the socialist cause, deeply realizing that the Chinese Communist Party is the great savior of the Chinese people and the strong leadership core of the revolutionary cause. Joining the Chinese Communist Party became his highest pursuit in his later life. He loved the Chinese Communist Party, supported the Party's leadership, and consciously regulated his words and deeds according to the Party Constitution. Many old comrades within the Party praised him as an "external Bolshevik." However, for the needs of the revolutionary cause, it was not until January 1980 that he realized his long-cherished wish to join the great Chinese Communist Party. He loved his country, loved socialism, was loyal to the people and the Party's cause, believed in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; he cared about state affairs, insisted on the Four Cardinal Principles, and maintained high unity with the Party Central Committee in his thoughts and politics; he was open-minded, upright, and honest; he was modest, approachable, and good at uniting with comrades to work together; he was strict with himself and lenient with others, served the people cleanly, and never sought special privileges and personal gains; he respected knowledge and talent, supported education; he strictly required and cared for cadres; he lived a thrifty life, sharing the worries of the country and the people. He dedicated his life to the victory of the new democratic revolution, the consolidation and development of the patriotic united front and socialist construction, and the modernization and regularization of the people's army, devoting all his energy.

The passing of Comrade Dong Qiuwu is a great loss to our Party, country, and army. His life was a life of patriotism; he pursued truth and light; he selflessly contributed his strength for the interests of the country and the nation; he made unremitting efforts for the prosperity and strength of the motherland and the struggle for national reunification. His indomitable revolutionary spirit, lofty character, and clean governance style have left us with precious spiritual wealth, which will always be deeply remembered and learned from.

Comrade Dong Qiuwu will live forever!

    董其武同志，１８９９年１１月２７日（农历１０月２５日）出生在山西省河津县一个贫苦农民家庭。早年受资产阶级民主革命思想的影响，立志救国救民，于１９１９年赴太原考入学兵团（又名斌业中学）。１９２４年参加胡景翼国民二军，开始了戎马生涯，历任排长、连长、营长、第九混成旅副官长。１９２７年参加北伐，任国民革命军第四军北伐先遣纵队支队长，转战豫皖。１９２８年秋，到天津投效傅作义部队，先后任上尉、少校参谋、干部政治训练所队长。１９３０年４月，任中校副团长、团长，１９３１年任３５军团长，驻防绥南。
    １９３１年“九·一八”事变后，董其武同志拥护中国共产党提出的“反对内战，一致抗日”的正确主张，民族大义凛然，积极投身抗日民族战争。面对日本帝国主义的侵略行径，他一面给傅作义将军写信，要求到东北抗击日寇；一面率领部队厉兵秣马，枕戈待旦。１９３３年５月中旬，率部参加“长城抗战”，在怀柔、石厂一线阻击日寇，率领全团官兵浴血奋战，打退日寇十多次的猖狂进攻，直至丧权辱国的《塘沽停战协定》签定后才被迫撤出阵地。１９３６年，任２１８旅少将旅长，在傅作义将军指挥的“绥远抗战”中，他率领部队星夜行动，出其不意，分路抄袭敌后，一举将红格尔图的日伪军歼灭，为百灵庙战役的胜利奠定了基础，被誉为“抗日民族英雄”。“七·七事变”后，他率部转战平绥一线，其后与八路军紧密配合，参加了著名的平型关战役、忻口会战。他率３０００精兵，深入日军腹地，身负重伤，坚持指挥奇袭板垣师团前线指挥所，取得了辉煌战果。１９３７年底，任１０１师中将师长，转战晋西北，结识了贺龙、南汉宸、程子华等八路军领导人，坚定了国共合作的信念。１９３８年，率部参加了“绥南战役”。同年底，随傅作义将军回到绥远后套地区，整军练武，寻机对日作战。１９３９年冬，率部参加了“包头战役”、“绥西战役”、“五原战役”，连续苦战１００多天，三战三捷，沉重打击了日寇侵略者的嚣张气焰，振奋了中华民族的抗日救国精神。１９４０年起，他先后担任暂三军中将军长、骑四军军长、３５军军长、第１２战区政治部主任兼晋陕绥边区副总司令期间始终坚持对日作战。
    １９４６年底，他任国民党绥远省政府主席兼绥远省保安司令。以后又任西北军政长官公署副长官。在此期间，他坚持拥护和平民主的政治主张，积极扩大生产，治理黄河，改善民生，兴办教育，搞好蒙汉团结。１９４９年１月，北平和平解放后，他审时度势，毅然接受中国共产党和毛泽东同志以和平方式解决绥远问题的主张，在傅作义将军的帮助下，冲破重重阻力，于１９４９年９月１９日率绥远军政人员通电起义，首创当时著名的“绥远方式”。接受中国共产党的领导，为和平解放绥远和新中国的建立，对我军集中力量打击国民党的残余势力，迅速解放全中国作出了重大贡献。他在绥远起义中的伟大功勋将永载史册。
    中华人民共和国成立后，董其武同志被任命为绥远军政委员会副主席，绥远省人民政府主席，中国人民解放军绥远军区副司令员，中国人民解放军第２３兵团司令员。在这期间，他不负党中央、毛泽东主席和朱德总司令对他“积极追求进步，致力改革旧制度，实行新政策，为实现部队解放军化、地方解放区化，建设人民的新绥远”的殷切期望。在华北军区聂荣臻司令员和薄一波政委的关怀指导下，积极团结军政人员，认真整顿社会治安，平息残匪叛乱，严惩不法分子，保卫人民生命财产安全，对稳定绥远局势竭尽全力。１９５１年，他率部赴朝作战，担任中国人民志愿军第２３兵团司令员，不畏艰险，不怕牺牲，指挥部队在时间紧、任务重的情况下胜利地完成了军事工程修建任务，发扬了革命英雄主义和国际共产主义精神，为抗美援朝，保家卫国作出了贡献。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会委员长授予他二级自由独立勋章。
    １９５３年后，董其武同志任中国人民解放军陆军第６９军军长，致力于我军现代化、正规化的建设。他多次组织部队进行实兵实弹演习和全军示范性的演习，率领部队圆满完成了军事训练、国防施工、营建生产等任务。１９６３年河北省遭受特大洪灾，他亲自指挥了抗洪抢险。他作风民主，身体力行，为人楷模，德高望重，深受广大官兵的拥戴。他坚持从严治军，努力加强部队的正规化建设，受到了中央军委的高度评价。１９７３年，他随中国政府代表团访问日本，为发展中日两国人民的友好关系作出了贡献。他历任第一、二、三届全国人民代表大会代表，全国人民代表大会第四、五届常委会委员，法制委员会委员，宪法修改委员会委员，中国人民政治协商会议第一届全国委员会委员及第三、四届常务委员，全国政协五、六届副主席，第一、二、三届国防委员会委员。１９５５年，被授予上将军衔，荣获一级解放勋章。１９８８年被授予胜利功勋荣誉章。
    十年动乱中，他对林彪、江青反革命集团的倒行逆施深恶痛绝，为国家、军队和人民的前途担忧，对很多惨遭迫害的老干部深表痛惜。并不顾个人安危，对他们及其子女给予关怀和生活照顾。粉碎“四人帮”后，他更加坚信中国共产党的领导，衷心拥护和坚决贯彻执行党的十一届三中全会以来的路线方针政策，多次深入工厂、农村、学校、部队，调查研究，参观视察，为改革开放献计献策，同时为落实起义投诚人员政策，尽心尽责，使许许多多的人得到了平反昭雪，增强了他们对党的信任，用他的言传身教维护了党在群众中的威信，为开创政协工作的新局面作了大量的工作。他积极致力于祖国统一事业，拥护党中央和邓小平同志提出的“一国两制”的构想，经常发表文章和讲话，希望早日实现祖国统一，在国内外产生很大影响。
    董其武同志从自己亲身的经历中，目睹了中国社会发展变化和社会主义事业所取得的伟大成就，深切认识到中国共产党是中国人民的大救星，是革命事业取得胜利的坚强领导核心，加入中国共产党成为他后半生的最高追求。他热爱中国共产党，拥护党的领导，自觉按党章要求规范自己的言行。许多党内的老同志称赞他是党外的布尔什维克。但为了革命工作的需要，直至１９８０年１月他才实现了多年的夙愿，加入了伟大的中国共产党。他热爱祖国，热爱社会主义，忠于人民，忠于党的事业，信仰马列主义和毛泽东思想；他关心国家大事，坚持四项基本原则，在思想上政治上同党中央保持高度一致；他襟怀坦荡，作风正派，光明磊落；他谦虚谨慎，平易近人，联系群众，善于团结同志一道工作；他严以律己，宽以待人，从政清廉，从不谋取特权和私利；他尊重知识，尊重人才，资助办学；他对干部既严格要求，又关心爱护；他生活克勤克俭，为国为民分忧。他为新民主主义革命的胜利，为巩固发展爱国统一战线和社会主义建设事业，为人民军队的现代化正规化建设，呕心沥血，鞠躬尽瘁，奉献了自己毕生的精力。
    董其武同志的逝世，是我们党、国家和军队的重大损失。他的一生是爱国的一生，他一生坚持真理，追求光明；为国家和民族的利益无私地贡献了自己的力量；为祖国的繁荣昌盛和争取祖国统一作了不懈的努力。他自强不息的革命精神，崇高的品德和为政廉洁的优良作风，给我们留下了宝贵的精神财富，永远值得我们深深地怀念和学习。
    董其武同志永垂不朽！
