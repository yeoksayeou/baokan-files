On January 22, I took the Guangzhou Civil Aviation Bureau's Flight 3397 back to Zhengzhou. I witnessed something puzzling: 20 empty seats on the airplane were used by the crew to place 4 bicycles. At that time, it was the peak of the Spring Festival travel rush. To buy a single ticket, I had to exert a lot of effort, and many people were unable to purchase tickets. I wonder what the leaders of the Guangzhou Civil Aviation Bureau think about this.

　　自行车占飞机座位
    １月２２日，我乘广州民航局的３３９７航班飞机回郑州，看到一件令人费解的事：飞机上的２０个空座位被空勤人员用来放置４辆自行车。当时正是春运高峰，为了买１张机票，我费了不少精力，还有许多人买不到机票。对此，不知广州民航局的领导人有何感想。
