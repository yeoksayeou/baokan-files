In late autumn, traveling by train from Baoji eastward, one enters the vast Guanzhong Plain. Looking out, one sees field after field of corn towers standing tall. These towers, about six or seven meters high, are densely packed and both straight and sturdy. It turns out that after the corn is harvested, its moisture content is quite high. To dry the corn, farmers have devised a clever method: they remove most of the husks, leaving only a few layers, and then tie three ears together into a bundle. They call this a "claw." Then, they stack these bundles onto poles standing upright on the ground. When stacking the towers, they spread the corn silk like flower petals, so that the ears press against each other and do not slide down from the high sides or tips of the tower. Naturally, this is a kind of technique. Farmers skilled in this craft stack the corn towers neatly and evenly, making them look like golden trees about a meter in diameter. One year, I went to the countryside in Wugong County and saw even more unusual corn towers. Some were shaped like dates, about three meters thick in the middle and tapering at both ends; others were narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, layer upon layer, resembling a snow pine. Appreciating the golden pyramids formed by these corn towers is truly a pleasure. They are not only a testament to a bountiful harvest but also reflect the farmers' ingenuity in celebrating their harvest.

In the areas of Xingping, Qian County, and Xianyang, the method of drying corn changes to a wall-like structure. Farmers first plant many poles on the ground, about a meter apart, forming rows. Then, they use rope or wire to create evenly spaced channels on the poles. Finally, they hang the corn, one claw at a time, on these channels. Thus, a silver or golden wall stands tall on the ground, looking like the walls of a fortress under the sun, shimmering with gold and silver. This wall-like structure for drying corn has better ventilation and dries more quickly. In years of hardship, to get the corn to the mill sooner, farmers preferred this method to reduce the drying time. In recent years, farmers along the Wei River have also invented a hanging method: they crush sorghum stalks and use the sorghum strips to clamp the corn, about a meter long. Then, they call a few strong men to lift the corn braids into the air, intertwining them with another braid and hanging them on a sturdy crossbeam. One crossbeam can hang dozens of braids. This method not only saves rope but also looks quite beautiful.

In the past two years, rodent damage has been severe. To prevent rats from destroying the grain, people have come up with another method: building aerial corn towers. These towers do not touch the ground or the sky, like lanterns, suspended by wire on high poles, and in a row. This is another style. Some of them are quite aesthetically pleasing in construction.

In some rural areas of Guanzhong, corn seems to be floating in the air. High up on tree branches, there are piles of corn, looking quite dangerous! Those without the skill to climb trees cannot make the branches serve them. Some families, to dry the corn, have come up with a strange method: they hammer countless small pegs into the wall behind the house or the back wall of the courtyard, and hang a claw or two of corn on each peg, making the wall shine brightly.

May these towers of autumn harvests become more dazzling and diverse year by year.

　　关中金字塔
    张丛笑
    深秋时节，从宝鸡乘火车东行，便进入广袤的关中平原。放眼望去，一片片场坝上，矗立着白的或金色的玉米塔。那塔高约六、七米，稠稠密密，一座座既直且粗。原来，玉米收获下来后，水分的含量相当高，为了让玉米风干，庄稼人便想出一个妙法：把玉米棒子的大部分外壳剥去，剩下少许的几片壳子，把棒子三个分为一束，然后把两束玉米壳子拴起来，称为一爪。之后，把它们垒到矗立在地上的椽子上。垒塔的时候，要把玉米棒花儿般地散成两朵，这样，棒子才会一个压一个，不至于从很高的塔腰或塔尖上滑下来。自然，这也是一种技术。庄稼行的把式们，垒的玉米塔粗又匀称，看上去真像一根一搂粗的黄金树。有一年，我到武功县的农村去，看见的玉米塔更为稀奇，那塔有的状如枣核，中间约有三搂粗，两头尖细；有的上尖下粗，层层叠叠，仿佛是一株雪松。欣赏那玉米塔垒成的金字塔，实在是一种享受。它既是丰收的纪实，又反映庄稼人庆贺丰收时所表现出来的才情。
    到了兴平、乾县、咸阳一带，凉晒玉米棒子的形式则变成了墙式。庄稼人先在地上栽下许多椽子，约一米一根，组成行，然后，再拿麻绳或铁丝在椽子上搭上间隔匀称的绳道，最后，把玉米一爪又一爪搭在绳道上。于是乎，地面上就矗立起了一面银的或金的壁垒，远看犹如城堡的围墙一般，在太阳下泄金淌银。这种墙式的玉米架透风较好，容易风干。生活困难的年月，为了让玉米早日上磨，农民最喜欢这么垒架，以减少风干的天数。近几年，渭河沿岸的庄稼人，还创造出一种垂吊法：他们把高粱秆碾破后，把玉米棒子一爪爪用高粱篾子夹起来，长约丈余。然后，唤来几个彪形大汉，把玉米大辫升到空中，跟另一条大辫的头儿互相交织，搭在一根粗而结实的横梁上边，一根横梁上可以垂吊下几十串。吊辫子既可节约绳索，也颇美观。
    这两年，鼠害严重，为了防止老鼠糟踏粮食，人们又想出一个法子：建造空中玉米塔。这种玉米塔，上不着天，下不接地，如同灯笼儿一般，用铁丝悬吊在高高的柱上，并且是一溜儿的。这又是一种格式。其建构也有的很讲究美观。
    关中有的农村，玉米简直是腾云驾雾了。高高的树杈上，垒着一都噜一都噜的玉米，望上去好险哟！没有爬树本领的人，是无法让树杈为自己服务的。有的人家，为了晒干玉米，还想了个怪法：在山墙或厦背子墙上，砸进无数个小橛子，给每个小橛子上挂上一两爪玉米，挂得满壁生辉。
    但愿这秋实之塔年年愈加炫目和多姿。
