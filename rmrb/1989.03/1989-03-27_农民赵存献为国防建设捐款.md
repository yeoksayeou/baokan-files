Farmer Zhao Cunxian Donates to National Defense Construction

Farmer Zhao Cunxian from Meng County, Henan Province, has donated his savings of 400,000 yuan as a permanent national defense construction fund, to be passed down through generations. According to an official from the Ministry of National Defense, this is the first such donation in the history of the People's Republic.

Zhao Cunxian is a provincial-level agricultural and forestry technician with extensive research on apple cultivation and storage preservation. Three years ago, after taking over the management of more than 1,000 apple trees in his village, he gradually improved his living conditions and has since made numerous donations to rural community welfare and educational causes.

　　农民赵存献为国防建设捐款
    新华社郑州３月２６日电  （记者谭道博、通讯员王跃进）河南省孟县农民赵存献将他的４万元存款捐献作为永久性国防建设基金，世代延续。据国防部官员说，在共和国历史上这样的捐款还是第一次。
    赵存献是省一级农林技术员，对苹果的栽培和贮藏保鲜有较深的研究。３年前，他承包村里的１０００多棵苹果树后，逐步过上了好日子，对乡村群众福利和教育事业多有捐赠。
