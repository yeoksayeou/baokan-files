The rectification and regulation of companies is like a heavy burden placed on the shoulders of bureau chiefs at all levels of the Administration for Industry and Commerce.

Recently, reporters from this newspaper visited a group of local bureau chiefs attending the National Bureau Chiefs Conference in Beijing. Liu Lizhi, the bureau chief of the Administration for Industry and Commerce of Hubei Province, recounted a difficult case with a hint of bitterness in his voice—

A company run by the railway department in the province sold several small cars last year. Just as the county Administration for Industry and Commerce was investigating the case, someone from the railway department said, "All the coal in your county will be transported by us!" This statement caused a stir. Thus, county leaders began to intercede on behalf of the railway department. The officials from the county Administration for Industry and Commerce were initially outraged, but after a moment of reflection, they realized that if they offended the railway department, the county would suffer even greater losses. The matter was dropped.

"We find it most difficult to deal with monopolistic industries!" When discussing this case, which is by no means isolated, Hu Chunzhou, the deputy bureau chief of the Administration for Industry and Commerce of Jilin Province, angrily remarked.

"The pursuit of money, quick profits from business," this new folk song reflects the "company fever" behind which lies the fever of profit-seeking. The difficulty in rectifying companies is precisely due to the tangled web of interests.

The bureau chiefs of Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Hebei provinces all mentioned that there is a type of company that troubles them—the "cooperation companies" established by various levels of local governments. Since the promotion of horizontal economic cooperation, local governments have established "cooperation offices," which have given rise to a host of companies that blur the lines between government and enterprise. Among these, there are those who take advantage of the situation. The "cooperation office" of a certain city in Anhui Province sold 41,000 tons of coal within the plan at high prices and then bought three imported cars. The municipal party and government organs, for the convenience of spending money, withdrew a large sum of cash from this company. Such "cooperation"! How can local Administrations for Industry and Commerce investigate such companies? Once an investigation is launched, local governments often accuse the Administration for Industry and Commerce of obstructing material cooperation between regions and "interfering" with local economic development. For bureau chiefs stationed in these localities, this is indeed a heavy burden to bear.

The bureau chiefs reflected that a major obstacle at present is that some local leaders fear that local finances will be affected and are reluctant to rectify companies, preventing the Administration for Industry and Commerce from getting involved. Even if the bureau chiefs try their best, they cannot even obtain basic data.

"Ah!" an old bureau chief sighed, "Now, there are not many departments in the locality that can represent the central government. The Administration for Industry and Commerce should be one of them. However, the central government wants us to speak 'Beijing dialect,' while the locality wants us to speak 'local dialect.' It's difficult..." Saying this, the bureau chief repeatedly requested that the reporter not disclose his name.

Bureau chiefs of the Administration for Industry and Commerce, what are you afraid of?

### 工商局长，怕什么……

　　工商局长，怕什么……
    本报记者  戴玉庆  潘岗
    清理整顿公司像是一副沉甸甸的担子，撂在了各级工商行政管理局局长的肩头。
    日前，记者在北京走访了出席全国工商局长会议的一批地方局长。湖北省工商局局长刘立志讲起一起难办的案件，话里略带苦涩——
    铁路部门在该省办的一家公司，去年倒卖了几辆小汽车。正当县工商局查办此案时，铁路方面来人说：“你们县的煤可全归我们运！”一句话就使人心惊。于是，县领导们纷纷说情。县工商局的同志本来窝着股火，后来冷静一想，真把运煤的得罪了，县里损失更大。事情不了了之。
    “垄断行业我们最难碰！”论到这起绝非个别的案例时，在旁的吉林省工商局副局长胡春周愤愤地说了这么一句。
    “一切向钱前，经商来得快”，这首新民谣反映了“公司热”的背后是利益动机在发烧。而整顿公司之所以难，也正是有一个剪不断、理还乱的利益网络。
    河南、湖北、四川、安徽、浙江、河北的工商局长都说，现在有一类公司使他们犯愁，这就是各级地方政府兴办的“协作公司”。自从开展横向经济联合，地方政府纷纷成立“协作办公室”，顺势生出一堆政企难分的公司，其中不乏混水摸鱼之辈。安徽某市“协作办”下属的“经协公司”，高价售出计划内的４．１万吨煤炭，又倒进三辆进口小车。市党政机关为了花钱方便，从这家公司支取了大笔现金。如此“协作”！对这类公司，地方工商局如何查得？一旦清查了，地方政府往往指责工商部门妨碍地区间物资协作，“干扰”地方经济发展。这对于在“落户”地方的工商局长们，还真有点担当不起呢。
    工商局长们反映，当前的一大阻力是某些地方领导担心地方财政受损，对整顿公司下不了手，不让工商局过问。纵是局长们在那里“跳”，连一些基本数据也摸不到。
    “咳！”一位老局长说：“现在，地方上还能尽力代表中央说话的部门已不是很多了，工商局应算一家。可是，中央要我们说‘北京话’，地方却要我们讲‘方言’。难哪……”说到此，这位局长一再要求记者不要公开他的姓名。
    工商局长们，你们怕什么呢？
