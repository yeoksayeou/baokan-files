On the eve of the closing of the 7th CPPCC National Committee's 2nd Session, the News and Publishing Committee held its final small group meeting. The attendees strongly called for strengthening news and public opinion supervision, and for providing support and protection for public opinion supervision.

Xie Wenqing (former Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television): I hope that Premier Li Peng's government work report will reiterate the issue of strengthening public opinion supervision. I believe that strengthening news and public opinion supervision is an important part of building socialist democracy. What we practice is a multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the Communist Party. If the Communist Party leads well, in addition to mutual supervision among the parties, there must also be public opinion supervision. The power of public opinion supervision is very great. Some people are so bold that when a newspaper names them, or when they appear on television, they become afraid and have to restrain themselves. If there is no public opinion supervision, I am very worried that our party will not be able to overcome the phenomenon of corruption. For public opinion supervision to be effective, news freedom must be guaranteed. As soon as news freedom is mentioned, some comrades always think it is a bourgeois slogan. In fact, the news freedom we are talking about is not that kind of unrestrained freedom. Such "freedom" does not even exist in capitalist countries. The news freedom I am talking about is freedom under the adherence to the four cardinal principles. Currently, in this regard, the news industry faces many constraints. Some things are just reported, and objections come from behind, and some are simply interfered with.

Fan Rongkang (Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the People's Daily): The rectification and deepening of reform cannot be separated from the fight against economic crimes and corruption. What will we rely on to fight? On party discipline, government discipline, and the law, as well as on public opinion supervision. However, if the party organization does not protect and support public opinion supervision, the news industry will find it very difficult to carry out criticism. Now, many reporters write critical reports and are then accused of defamation, slander, and damaging reputation, and are taken to court. For example, not long ago, a reporter from an evening newspaper wrote a report criticizing a factory's workshop hygiene, and as a result, the factory sued the newspaper, and the newspaper had to spend half a year fighting the lawsuit. Although the newspaper eventually won the case, how many half-years can they afford to spend? While the plaintiff only lost a few dozen yuan in lawsuit fees.

Zhao Chaogou (President of the Xinmin Evening News) interjected: And increased their "fame."

Lu Yin (Central Committee Member of the China Democratic League, Honorary Professor of Fudan University): The role of public opinion supervision is self-evident. Not long ago, the Liberation Daily published a small news item revealing some high-ranking officials' car license plates used for sending their children to school, and the situation improved as a result.

According to statistics from relevant departments, last year there were over 300 cases of reporters and news organizations being sued. This makes them busy with lawsuits all day, wasting energy and tying their hands, to the extent that some reporters and news organizations dare not write critical reports. In view of this situation, the committee members once again called for the prompt formulation of a press law.

Fan Rongkang: Regarding public opinion supervision, the report of the 13th Party Congress and last year's NPC report have already officially proposed it, but to this day the press law has not been issued, and our current laws do not have clauses to protect reporters. Before the press law is issued, we call on party committees and judicial departments at all levels to support and protect public opinion supervision.

Xie Wenqing: We must believe that most of our reporters are good and will help our country get through difficult times through public opinion supervision. Therefore, we must promptly formulate a press law to guarantee news freedom and protect the legal rights of reporters and news organizations. This is an urgent matter.

　　政协新闻出版组委员呼吁：        
    支持和保护舆论监督
    本报记者  张旭平
    政协七届二次会议闭幕前夕，新闻出版组举行的最后一次小组会上，与会委员强烈呼吁，加强新闻舆论监督，给舆论监督以支持和保护。
    谢文清（广播电影电视部原副部长）：希望李鹏总理的政府工作报告把加强舆论监督的问题再重申一下。我认为加强新闻舆论监督，是建立社会主义民主的重要部分。我们实行的，是在共产党领导下的多党合作制度。共产党领导得好，除了要有各党派间的互相监督外，还要有舆论监督。舆论监督的力量是很大的。有些人胆大包天，报纸一点名，电视上晃一眼，他就害怕，就不能不有所收敛。如果没有舆论监督，我很担心我们党不能战胜腐败现象。而要舆论监督起作用，就必须保障新闻自由。一提新闻自由，有些同志总以为是资产阶级的口号。其实，我们所说的新闻自由，当然不是那种不受任何约束的自由。那种“自由”，在资本主义国家也没有。我说的新闻自由，是在坚持四项基本原则下的自由。现在，在这方面，新闻界受到的约束还很多，有的事情刚一报道，背后抗议就出来了，有的简直是横加干涉。
    范荣康（人民日报副总编辑）：治理整顿、深化改革离不开同经济犯罪活动和腐败现象作斗争。靠什么去斗争？靠党纪政纪，靠国法，也靠舆论监督。可是，如果党组织不保护和支持舆论监督，新闻界就很难开展批评。现在有很多记者一写批评性报道，就被冠以诽谤、诬陷、伤害名誉等罪名告到法院。例如不久前一家晚报记者写了一篇批评一家工厂生产车间卫生差的报道，结果厂家把报社告到法院，报社不得不陪了半年时间打官司，尽管最后报社胜诉，但又有多少个半年能陪呢？而原告只损失了几十元的诉讼费。
    赵超构（新民晚报社社长）插话：还提高了“知名度”。
    陆诒（民盟中央委员、复旦大学名誉教授）：舆论监督的作用不言而喻。解放日报不久前曾登了一条小新闻，公布了一些高干用于送子女上中学的小车车牌号，结果情况有所好转。
    据有关部门统计，去年记者和新闻单位被告事件达３００余起，这使得他们整天忙于打官司，既浪费了精力又束缚了手脚，以至于有的记者和新闻单位不敢再写批评性的报道。鉴于此种状况，委员们再次呼吁，尽快制定出新闻法。
    范荣康：关于舆论监督，党的十三大报告和去年人大报告中已正式提出，但至今新闻法迟迟未出，而我们现行法律又没有保护记者的条文。在新闻法出来以前，我们呼吁各级党委和司法部门支持舆论监督，保护舆论监督。
    谢文清：要相信我们的记者大多数是好的，是会通过舆论监督帮助我们国家度过难关的。因此，要尽快制定新闻法以保证新闻自由，保障记者和新闻单位的合法权益。这已是当务之急。
