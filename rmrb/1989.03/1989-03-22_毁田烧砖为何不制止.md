Since last winter, some rural areas in our city have seen significant destruction of fields for brick making. Preliminary statistics show that there are 9,182 brick kilns in the rural areas of the entire city, destroying 3,846 mu of farmland. Among them, Suining County alone has destroyed over 1,200 mu of farmland for brick making. Some of these destroyed fields have turned into deep ponds and pits, reaching depths of three to four meters.

The main reasons for the destruction of farmland are as follows: some farmers believe that making bricks is more profitable than farming, so they do not go through any procedures and take soil from their own contracted fields to make bricks; some village and team cadres turn a blind eye to this phenomenon.

　　毁田烧砖为何不制止
    去冬以来，我市一些乡村毁田烧砖相当严重。据初步统计，全市农村建砖窑９１８２座，毁田３８４６亩。其中，绥宁县烧砖毁田１２００多亩。这些被毁的田地，有些已成了深达三四米的池塘和太坑。
    毁田的原因主要是：有的农民认为种田不如烧砖收入高，便不办任何手续，在自己的责任田里取土烧砖；有的村组干部对这种现象听之任之。
