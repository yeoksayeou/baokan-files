A major wildfire broke out in Hong Kong's Tai Mo Shan Country Park, which has been burning for over 30 hours since it started at noon on February 28. The fire has scorched an area of 130 hectares.

The fire initially threatened the safety of nearby residents in agricultural areas and this morning it approached the Tuen Mun Road. The Hong Kong Fire Services Department and the Agriculture and Fisheries Department mobilized hundreds of personnel to combat the blaze, while the Air Force deployed helicopters to drop water bombs. At the time of this report, the fire has been brought under control.

A spokesperson for the Agriculture and Fisheries Department stated that this wildfire is the largest in the past three years.
