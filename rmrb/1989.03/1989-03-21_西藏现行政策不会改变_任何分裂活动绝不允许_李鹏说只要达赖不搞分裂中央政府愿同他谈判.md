Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 20th.

Li Peng, the Premier, today solemnly pointed out that any foreign forces, regardless of the pretext, supporting "Tibet independence" separatist activities are a gross interference in China's internal affairs and are absolutely not permissible.

Li Peng said in the government work report that recently, a few separatist elements instigated riots in Lhasa, attracting the attention of all ethnic groups across the country. To maintain national unity and ethnic solidarity, to maintain social order, and to ensure the safety of people's lives and property, the State Council decided to impose martial law in Lhasa, which has been supported by the broad masses of Tibetan compatriots and people across the country, striking a blow to the few separatist elements' reactionary arrogance. Now, the social order in Lhasa is gradually returning to normal, and people's lives are becoming stable.

He said, our policies of promoting Tibet's economic and cultural development, protecting the Tibetan people's freedom of religious belief, and respecting local customs and habits, among others, will not change. As long as the Dalai Lama abandons the "Tibet independence" stance, does not engage in separatist activities, and maintains national unity and ethnic solidarity, the central government is willing to negotiate with him. It is known to all that the Tibet Autonomous Region is an inseparable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China, and anyone attempting "Tibet independence" will not succeed.

　　西藏现行政策不会改变        
    任何分裂活动绝不允许        
    李鹏说只要达赖不搞分裂中央政府愿同他谈判
    新华社北京３月２０日电  李鹏总理今天严正指出，任何外国势力不管用什么借口支持“西藏独立”的分裂活动，都是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是绝对不能允许的。
    李鹏在政府工作报告中说，最近，少数分裂主义分子在拉萨制造骚乱，引起了全国各族人民的关注。为了维护祖国统一和民族团结，维护社会秩序和保障人民的人身、财产安全，国务院决定在拉萨实行戒严，得到了广大藏族同胞和全国人民的拥护，打击了少数分裂主义分子的反动气焰。现在，拉萨社会秩序正在逐步恢复正常，人民生活趋于安定。
    他说，我们实行的促进西藏经济和文化发展，保护藏族人民宗教信仰自由，尊重当地风俗习惯等一系列现行政策，都不会改变。达赖喇嘛只要放弃“西藏独立”的主张，不搞分裂活动，维护祖国统一和民族团结，中央政府就愿意同他进行谈判。众所周知，西藏自治区是中华人民共和国领土不可分割的一部分，任何人搞“西藏独立”都是不能得逞的。
