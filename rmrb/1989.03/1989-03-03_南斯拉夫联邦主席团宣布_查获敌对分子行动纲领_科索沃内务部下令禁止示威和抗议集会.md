Yugoslav Federal Presidency Announces Seizure of Hostile Elements' Action Plan
Kosovo Interior Department Orders Ban on Demonstrations and Protest Gatherings

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) — Correspondent Yan Zheng reports: Yesterday, Yugoslav Federal Presidency member Mojsov announced at an extraordinary session of the Federal Assembly that Yugoslavia had seized an "action plan" for hostile activities by Albanian nationalist elements in Kosovo on February 25.

Mojsov said that this "action plan" was drafted by some members of the League of Communists of Kosovo in early February. He noted that the recent general strike by Albanian people in Kosovo is a step in the counter-revolutionary plan of Albanian nationalist separatists. According to this "action plan," their actions are divided into three steps. The first step is the general strike that has just taken place; the second step is to take new actions around March 15 when the Kosovo Assembly discusses the Serbian Constitution and the 8th anniversary of the counter-revolutionary events in Kosovo; the third step is to launch an armed uprising. In view of the above situation, Mojsov reiterated that to normalize the situation, it is necessary to firmly implement the line of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia without any wavering.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) — Correspondent Yan Zheng reports: Today, the Interior Minister of Kosovo, Yugoslavia, issued an order prohibiting demonstrations and protest gatherings in public places and called on people of all ethnic groups to contribute to the stabilization of the situation in Kosovo Autonomous Province with practical actions. This order will be enforced starting today by the Kosovo Interior Department.

    南斯拉夫联邦主席团宣布
    查获敌对分子行动纲领
    科索沃内务部下令禁止示威和抗议集会
    本报贝尔格莱德3月2日电　记者严正报道：昨天南联邦主席团委员莫伊索夫在联邦议会两院非常会议上宣布，南斯拉夫2月25日查获了一份科索沃阿尔巴尼亚族民族主义分子进行敌对活动的“行动纲领”。
    莫伊索夫说，这份“行动纲领”是科索沃自治省的一些共盟盟员在2月初制订的。最近科索沃阿族人的总罢工是阿民族分裂主义分子反革命计划中的一个步骤。根据这份“行动纲领”，他们的行动计划分为三步。第一步即日前进行的总罢工；第二步是在3月15日左右科索沃议会讨论塞尔维亚宪法和科索沃反革命事件8周年时，将采取新的行动；第三步是举行武装起义。鉴于上述情况，莫伊索夫重申，为了使局势正常化必须坚决执行南共联盟的路线，不能有任何动摇。
    本报贝尔格莱德3月2日电　记者严正报道：今天南斯拉夫科索沃内务部长发布命令，禁止在公共场所举行示威和抗议集会，并呼吁各族人民用实际行动为稳定科索沃自治省局势作出贡献。此命令今天开始由科索沃内务部开始执行。
