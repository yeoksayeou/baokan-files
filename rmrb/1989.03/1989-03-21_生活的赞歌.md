Opening the collection of "Zhang Ke Ran's Sketches," bustling mines, towering iron arms at the harbor, and crisscrossing forests immediately catch the eye. Here, there is the rhythm of modern times, grand melodies, fervent passion, and a rich atmosphere of life. Under Ke Ran's brush, whether it is the Gezhouba project or the water towns of Shaoxing, they are like wafts of spring breeze, all of which invigorate the spirit and stir the heart. These works, with spirit over form, and objects and spirit intertwined, compose a chapter of realism.

The famous Northern Song Dynasty painter Guo Xi once pointed out in his essay "Mountain Water Training" that to "seize the essence of nature," one must be skilled and diligent, travel extensively, and meticulously record everything in one's mind. In other words, one must expand one's learning, enrich one's experiences, and refine one's forms. In summary, one must deeply observe and analyze the objects to be painted before entering the creative process.

Ke Ran's sketches are all drawn with a steel pen. His compositions are simple and concise, with rich expressive power. In terms of composition, he eliminates the unnecessary and captures the essence, making his works highly decorative. When dealing with the relationships between various objects in his paintings, he strives for clarity in the composition and maintains a balance of strength. By "clarity," it is meant that the distribution of black and white on the canvas is appropriate. Achieving this requires a high level of artistic accomplishment; Ke Ran, however, benefits from his solid foundation in printmaking.

　　生活的赞歌
    王春立
    打开《张克让速写》集，喧嚣沸腾的矿山，铁臂林立的海港，纵横交错的林场，立即闯入眼帘。这里有现代的节奏，雄伟的旋律，炽热的激情和浓郁的生活气息。在克让的笔下，无论是葛洲坝的工程，还是绍兴的水乡，都像一缕缕春风，无不使人精神振奋，荡气回肠。这些作品，以神取形，物与神游，奏出了现实主义的乐章。
    北宋著名画家郭熙在《山水训》一文中曾经指出，若要“夺其造化”，必须神于好，精于勤，饱游饫看，历历罗列胸中；换句话说，就是要学养扩充，流览淳厚，经历众多，取形精粹。总之，要深入实际观察、分析所画的物象，而后进入创作过程。
    克让的速写，都是用钢笔画的。他的画面，单纯凝练，有着丰富的表现力。在构图上，删减拨要，概括其质，装饰性很强；在处理所画各种物象的关系时，力求画面明晰，保持能力的平衡。所谓“明晰”，是指在画面上黑白分布恰当。如做到这一点，需有较高的艺术造诣；而克让，则得益于他的深厚的版画基础。
