From the People's Daily, March 3rd:

Baoji City in Shaanxi Province has been promoting intercropping and relay cropping. Last year, the total area reached 1.827 million mu, producing an additional 47.56 million kilograms of grain and increasing income by over 19 million yuan. The forms of intercropping and relay cropping have evolved from mainly grain-grain combinations to a more diversified and standardized approach, including grain-oil, grain-vegetable, grain-fruit, grain-fertilizer, and grain-medicine combinations. The areas practicing intercropping and relay cropping have expanded from old irrigation zones to new irrigation zones and from plains to mountainous regions, forming a new pattern of grain-oil integration, composite configuration, and three-dimensional development.
