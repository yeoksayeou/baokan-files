Lhasa was calm last night after martial law was imposed. The sky was clear and the stars shone brightly. After three days and nights of fear, most people had already gone to sleep, while a few houses still had lights on.

Reporters walked along several main streets and alleys in Lhasa and saw soldiers standing guard on both sides of the streets. Everywhere was quiet.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Lhasa on March 7, several hundred rioters continued to roam the streets of Lhasa in small groups, engaging in looting, arson, and vandalism.

At around 11:30 AM, several hundred rioters gathered in front of the public security bureau on Barkhor Street, shouting slogans and attempting to attack the bureau again. Later, a group of rioters marched to the southeast street of Barkhor Street, where they continued to smash shops that had not been completely destroyed the previous day. The rioters also smashed some shops and stalls in the Chongqing Market. Subsequently, over 300 rioters entered Barkhor Street, destroying and setting fire to goods on both sides of the street. The street was filled with thick smoke, and there were occasional explosions from burning oil drums or paint cans.

In some alleys, rioters waved the "Snow Lion Flag" and shouted slogans calling for Tibetan independence.

　　拉萨戒严后街头平静
    昨天仍有骚乱发生
    据新华社拉萨３月８日凌晨电  昨夜拉萨天蓝星灿，格外宁静。人们经过三天三夜的惊恐，绝大多数人已经安睡，少数人家的窗户里还亮着灯光。
    记者沿着拉萨的几条主要街道和一些小巷巡行，看见解放军战士在街道两旁肃立执勤，所到之处都十分宁静。
    据新华社拉萨３月７日电　数百名骚乱分子今天以分散小股活动方式，继续在拉萨一些大街小巷游行，并沿街打砸抢烧。
    上午１１点多，数百名骚乱分子集结在八廓街公安派出所门前呼喊口号，企图再次向派出所施用暴力。后来，一伙骚乱者游行到八廓街的东南街，在那里打砸昨天没有砸完的商店物品。骚乱分子还打砸了冲赛康市场的一些商店和经商摊位。其后，３００余名骚乱分子进入八廓街，砸毁并放火烧了街道两旁的一些商品。街上浓烟滚滚，时有煤油或油漆桶燃烧后的爆炸声。
    骚乱分子在一些街巷打着“雪山狮子旗”，呼喊西藏独立的口号。
