	“Success” in What?
	Jiang Zengpei

	At the end of last year, the Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House published the “Comprehensive Guide to Literary and Art Appreciation” in Shanghai, which was very popular. It should be said that this book still has some shortcomings in its compilation and is not perfect. The reason it was welcomed by readers is that it better meets the current demand for improving artistic cultivation and appreciation, with its own unique advantages and strengths. In the words of readers, it is: “Abundant yet concise, both profound and beautiful.”

	“Abundant” refers to its comprehensive nature in terms of categories. Different categories of art each have their own characteristics, but they also share commonalities and general rules. This determines that people's understanding of art should pay attention to observing and studying the specific characteristics of particular art forms, as well as comparing different forms to gain a deeper understanding of the essence of art. Previous literary and art appreciation books, such as the “Dictionary of Tang Poetry Appreciation” and the “Dictionary of Classical Prose Appreciation,” were mostly limited to a single art category. The “Comprehensive Guide” covers novels, poetry, essays, drama, film, music, dance, painting, calligraphy, seal carving, sculpture, architecture, gardens, and literary theory—14 departments in total. It is the first to provide a comprehensive literary and art appreciation reference book.

	“Concise” refers to the representative nature of the selected works. To possess artistic cultivation, one naturally needs to read and appreciate literary works. However, with the vast number of literary works from ancient to modern times, both domestic and foreign, and the limited time in life, there is an urgent need for an optimization principle, a principle of maximum efficiency. This principle is to conduct extensive and strict screening in the sea of art, selecting a few truly outstanding works to recommend to a wide range of readers for reading and appreciation. The “Comprehensive Guide” covers a wide range of literary and art genres, but the selected works were chosen after extensive consultation and finally reviewed by nine domestic experts, resulting in only 900 pieces. The quantity is relatively small. However, due to the high quality of the selections, it can achieve the effect of “less is more.”

	“Profound” refers to the precision of the analyses. The concise and insightful analytical texts in the “Comprehensive Guide” can better serve as a “guide.”

	“Beautiful” refers to the elegant and innovative design of the cover, as well as the superior printing quality, making the “Comprehensive Guide” not only a carrier of artworks but also an artwork in itself. Therefore, it is regarded by many as a good “cultural gift,” and there are many people who buy two or more copies from the Xinhua Bookstore, mostly for giving to loved ones and friends.

　　“成”在哪里
     江曾培
    去年年底，上海文艺出版社出版的《文艺鉴赏大成》在沪发行，很受欢迎。应该说，本书在编写上还存在一些缺点与弱点，并不那么完“好”，它所以受到读者欢迎，是因为较好地吻合了当前人们提高艺术修养与艺术鉴赏力的要求，有着自己特具的优点与长处，用读者的反映来说，就是：“又多又少，既精且美。”
    “多”，指其门类的综合性。艺术的不同门类，各有各的特点，同时又有着共同点，有着普通规律。由此决定人们对艺术的了解，既要注意观察研究特定艺术品种的特殊性，又要注意将不同品种综合比较，以便更深入地掌握艺术真谛。过去出版的一些文艺鉴赏书籍，如《唐诗鉴赏辞典》《古文鉴赏辞典》等，大多限于某一艺术门类，《大成》则囊括了小说、诗歌、散文、戏剧、电影、音乐、舞蹈、绘画、书法、篆刻、雕塑、建筑、园林以及文艺理论１４个部门，率先提供了一部综合性的文艺鉴赏大型工具书。
    “少”，则是指其所选的作品具有典范性。人们要拥有艺术修养，自然需要阅读、观赏文艺作品。但在古今中外文艺作品汗牛充栋，而人生有涯，这里，亟需一个优化的原则，一个最大效率的原则。这个原则，就是要在艺海中进行广泛而严格的筛选，选出少量的真正的精品、珍品，推荐给广大读者阅读、鉴赏。《大成》虽然涉及文艺品种甚多，但所选作品经过广泛征求意见，最后由国内９位专家分别审定，一共只保留９００篇，数量相对说来是少的。但由于所选较精，能起到“以少胜多”的作用。
    “精”，指其评析的精当性。《大成》中那些要言不烦、画龙点睛的评析文字，可以较好地起着这种“引导”作用。
    “美”，则是指其装帧设计美观新颖，加以印刷质量也是上乘的，因而《大成》这本书，不仅是艺术作品的载体，而且它本身也成了一件艺术品。因此，它被许多人视为一件很好的“文化礼品”，在新华书店买二本以上的不乏其人，大多都是为了馈赠至爱亲朋的。
