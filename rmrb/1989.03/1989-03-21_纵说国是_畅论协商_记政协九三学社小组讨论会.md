The image of the CPPCC is gradually changing. In the past, some people said it was a decorative piece, a mere formality; later, they said it was a place for idle talk, a gathering of immortals. Now, everyone can see that the CPPCC has indeed begun to play its important role.” Chen Mingzhao, the first speaker, opened the Nine Three Society’s first group discussion meeting held yesterday morning.

Chen Mingzhao paused briefly, and Qiao Yijin immediately raised his hand to request to speak. Tang Liming had a different approach, pulling the microphone towards himself early on.

The discussion lasted for over two hours in the morning without a single interruption, focusing mainly on one central topic: the recognition and suggestions regarding the “consultation” role of the democratic parties.

Wang Yu proposed a common problem: the central level pays great attention to the work of the CPPCC, but the enthusiasm decreases as you go down the levels. He believed that grassroots-level consultations are also very important and suggested that the National CPPCC organize an inspection to see how the implementation is going.

Zhang Shuying pointed out in his speech that the current breadth and depth of consultations are far from sufficient, limited only to a small, high-level circle. Merely arranging for a few individuals to participate in government work cannot reflect the opinions of democratic parties in national affairs. He suggested that at various levels, departments should directly establish consultation bodies led by the main leaders, which do not interfere with government affairs but participate in political affairs. They can review documents, understand the situation, and attend meetings, thereby fully playing the roles of consultation, supervision, and coordination of the democratic parties.

As the delegates gradually left the meeting room, one delegate had already signed up in advance for the next group meeting to speak.

　　纵说国是　畅论协商        
    ——记政协九三学社小组讨论会
    本报记者  费伟伟
    “政协的形象在逐步改变。过去有人说是花瓶，是摆设；后来又说是清谈馆、神仙会。现在大家都看到，政协确实已开始发挥自己的重要作用。”第一个发言的陈明绍委员作了九三学社昨天上午首次小组讨论会的开场白。
    陈明绍话音稍停，笪移今委员立即举手，请求发言。唐立民委员另有高招，早早地把话筒拉到自己面前。
    上午两个多小时的讨论没有片刻中断，基本围绕一个中心话题：对民主党派“协商”作用的认识和建议。
    汪愚委员提出一个普遍存在的问题，就是对政协工作中央一级很重视，但越往下温度越低。他认为基层的协商也十分重要，要加强中央对基层的指导作用，并建议全国政协组织一次检查，看看落实情况如何。
    张叔英在发言中指出，目前协商的广度和深度都很不够，仅仅局限在高层的小范围内。仅安排个别人参加政府工作，不能反映民主党派在国家事务中的意见。应该重视民主党派的群体作用。他建议，在各级部门直接设立由主要领导负责的参政机构，不干预政府事务但要参预政务，可以看文件，了解情况，列席会议等，这样就能充分发挥民主党派的咨询、监督、协调等作用。
    当委员们陆续走出会议室时，一位委员已在为下次小组会上发言提前挂号了。
