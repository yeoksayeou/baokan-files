A 46-year-old woman from Dàlóngwáng Village in Lüshunkou, Liaoning Province, Kong Fuhong, struggled with fierce winds and waves in the sea for 130 hours on a small boat and was rescued on the evening of February 22 in the jurisdiction of Muping County, Shandong Province.

On the morning of February 17, after breakfast, Kong Fuhong and her cousin Zhang Jicheng set out in a small boat to work in a nearby marine aquaculture area. Unfortunately, they were swept into deep waters by a large wave and were unable to return. Zhang Jicheng, suffering from cold and hunger, died on the boat in less than five days. Kong Fuhong, left alone, gripped the oar and rudder tightly to prevent the boat from capsizing and was eventually discovered and rescued by fishermen from Shandong.
