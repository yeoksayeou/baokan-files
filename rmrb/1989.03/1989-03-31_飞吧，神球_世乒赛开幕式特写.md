Around 6 AM, 80 students from Dortmund, dressed in short-sleeved shirts and jeans, holding the flags of the 40th World Table Tennis Championships, ran into the hall with vigor, circling the arena once to symbolize the relay of table tennis from generation to generation. Athletes of various skin colors, dressed in colorful sportswear, entered from four directions and gathered together. Amidst the enthusiastic applause from the audience, West German table tennis enthusiasts holding national flags surged into the hall, creating a wave of colors. When the Chinese five-star red flag was raised, it received an especially fervent applause from the audience. Under the constantly changing colored spotlights, the Federal Defense Force band played the modern pop-style anthem of the International Table Tennis Federation, "Magic Ball," over and over again. The lyrics "Let us compete side by side, let us gather together, in peace and friendship, the winner's glory will last forever..." echoed through the hall.

This song was composed by 34-year-old Neuman from West Germany specifically for the Dortmund tournament.

A giant blue globe model slowly rolled into the hall. The globe split open, and a red-clad clown emerged, beginning a mime performance centered around table tennis. Artists from Cologne, Düsseldorf, West Berlin, and other places performed with humor and exaggeration, showcasing the increasing popularity of table tennis. The climax of the opening ceremony was the final act: the red-clad clown struck the ball with a racket, and a shower of balls followed. Suddenly, 7,000 table tennis balls with "40th World Table Tennis Championships · Dortmund" printed on them rained down from the ceiling like a sudden downpour. The athletes from various countries re-entered the arena, striking the balls towards the audience seats. The audience eagerly caught them as souvenirs, and laughter and cheers filled the air.

As the 12-time world champion and president of the International Table Tennis Federation, Ogimura, said, table tennis has become one of the world's top five sports. Everyone wishes for the success of this World Table Tennis Championships! Fly, magic ball!

　　飞吧，神球        
    ——世乒赛开幕式特写
    ６时许，８０名多特蒙德的小学生身着短袖衫和牛仔裤，手持第４０届世乒赛会旗英姿勃勃跑进大厅，绕场一周，象征着乒乓运动代代接力有来人。身着五彩缤纷运动服的各种肤色的运动员从四个方向入场，与他们汇集在一处。在观众热烈的掌声中，手持各国国旗的西德乒乓球爱好者涌进大厅，场里顿时翻起一片色彩的波涛。中国的五星红旗抛起时，招来观众格外热烈的掌声。在不断变幻的彩色聚光灯下，联邦国防军乐队一遍遍地奏起国际乒联现代波普风格的会歌“神球”。“让我们并肩拚搏，让我们相聚一处，在和平与友谊中，胜者美名与世永存……”的歌声响彻大厅。
    这首歌是西德３４岁的诺伊曼专门为多特蒙德大赛而作的。
    一个巨大的蓝色地球模型缓缓滚进大厅，地球裂开，钻出一个红衣小丑，以乒乓运动为主线的哑剧表演开始了。来自科隆、杜塞尔多夫、西柏林等地艺术家们诙谐夸张的表演，显示出乒乓运动日益得到人们的喜爱。开幕式的高潮在最后一场：红衣小丑挥拍一击，竟引来一阵球雨。只见顶棚上７０００个印有“第４０届世乒赛·多特蒙德”字样的乒乓球纷纷扬扬如骤雨初下，各国运动员再次入场，把一个个球击向观众席，观众们纷纷接过留作纪念，欢声笑语不绝于耳。
    正如１２次获得过世界冠军称号的国际乒联主席荻村所说，乒乓球已成为世界５大运动项目之一。人们祝愿本届世乒赛成功！飞吧，神球！
