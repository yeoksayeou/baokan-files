The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry issued a statement on March 3, saying that the Latin American Eight-Nation Group Foreign Ministers' Meeting will not change its original date and venue due to recent unrest in Venezuela.

The foreign ministers of the eight nations are scheduled to meet in the Venezuelan city of Puerto Ordaz from March 9 to 11 to discuss issues such as Latin American foreign debt, integration, and the peace process in Central America.

A spokesperson for the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry stated that the recent unrest in the country will not affect the convening of the meeting or its work plan.
