The work of rectifying the economic environment and restoring economic order, which began in the fourth quarter of last year, has shown some initial results, but we should not overestimate them.

The initial results are mainly reflected in the progress made in clearing up ongoing projects and reducing the scale of investment. The rapid growth of social consumption has been initially controlled. The excessively high industrial growth rate has started to decline, and the production of some marketable goods has increased. The upward trend in market prices has weakened, and the public's anxiety about prices has eased. The comprehensive inspections of finances, taxes, and prices, as well as the rectification of companies, have achieved good results. The disorder in the circulation sector has started to improve. The scale of bank credit has started to be controlled, and urban and rural savings deposits have gradually increased. These situations indicate that the guiding principles of rectifying the economic environment, restoring economic order, and deepening reforms comprehensively, as decided by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, are completely correct. The series of policies and measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the State Council are in line with reality and have had a positive effect on stabilizing the economy.

Why should we not overestimate the results? Because the rectification and order restoration work has just begun, and the tasks are still very arduous. The work of curbing excessive demand has progressed slowly and has not achieved the expected results. Although 17,000 projects have been decided to be halted or delayed, and 500 billion yuan of construction investment has been reduced, the scale of the ongoing projects is only 200 billion yuan, which is less than one-fourth of the planned reduction. Excessive personal consumption demand has not been effectively controlled, and the risk of further expansion still exists. Although the industrial growth rate has slowed down, the industrial structure has not been adjusted as required. Many projects that should have been reduced have not been, and many that should have been protected have not been. Especially, the production of long-term scarce energy and raw materials has not increased, and the supply-demand contradiction has become more prominent. Transportation is even more strained. Many fundamental contradictions in economic life still exist. We must have a clear understanding of this.

The rectification and order restoration work has entered a critical stage. The current task is to consider the overall situation and firmly implement the principles of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. In particular, the reduction of basic construction investment scale must be firm and unyielding, and the stabilization of prices must be firm and unyielding.

Reducing the scale of basic construction investment is the most effective way to alleviate the contradiction between total supply and demand in society and curb inflation. The general public supports the policies and measures of the Party Central Committee and the State Council in this regard. Why have the expected results not been achieved in the past few months? The main reason is that many regions have a wait-and-see attitude, emphasizing their own uniqueness, comparing with each other, and fearing to lose out. Therefore, many projects that should have been halted or delayed have not been stopped, and some are even rushing to complete them to create a fait accompli to resist the halt or delay. In some regions, although construction projects have been stopped, they still harbor a lucky mindset, thinking that, like in the past, the tightening wind will soon pass, and they won't have to wait long to resume work. These comrades have not thought about this: if the excessive total social demand is not curbed, the supply of grain, cotton, and oil will always be so tight, transportation will always be so strained, and coal, electricity, oil, and other energy and raw materials will always be in short supply. The entire social economy will be like a bow that has been pulled taut for a long time, and it is inevitable that it will break one day. At that time, 1.1 billion people will be in a state of panic, and we will face not only an economic crisis but also a political crisis. Moreover, this time, the rectification and order restoration work is combined with the adjustment of the industrial structure. What to reduce and what to protect is not only for solving the problem of investment expansion but also for the planned and proportional stable development of the entire national economy in the future, and for a reorganization of the industrial structure. For this reason, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have repeatedly emphasized that the rectification and order restoration work must achieve results. If two years are not enough, the time can be extended. Even if it is necessary to take some administrative measures, it cannot be half-hearted. The idea of always fearing to lose out and thinking that avoiding the wind will soon pass must be discarded. For those basic construction projects that cannot increase effective supply, and for those that cannot alleviate but only exacerbate the supply-demand contradictions of energy and raw materials and only exacerbate the strain on transportation, they must be proactively halted and quickly halted. The earlier they are halted, the more proactive they are, the more proactive the country is. It is very difficult to avoid, and even if it is avoided now, the project is built, it will have to be adjusted during the adjustment of the industrial structure in the future!

　　治理整顿要坚定不移
    本报评论员
    从去年第四季度开始的治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的工作进行得怎样了？简单的回答：已开始见到成效，但不能估计过高。
    初见成效，主要表现在清理在建项目，压缩投资规模取得一定进展。社会集团消费增长过快的状况初步得到控制。过高的工业增长速度开始回落，一些适销对路商品进一步增产。市场物价上涨势头减弱，群众对物价的紧张心理有所缓和。财务税收和物价大检查、整顿公司工作取得较好成绩。流通领域秩序混乱的状况开始有所改善。银行信贷规模开始得到控制，城乡储蓄存款逐渐回升。这些情况表明，十三届三中全会确定的治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的指导方针是完全正确的，党中央、国务院所采取的一系列政策措施是符合实际的，对稳定经济已经产生了积极作用。
    为什么不能估计过高呢？因为治理、整顿工作仅仅是开始，任务还很艰巨。抑制过旺需求的工作进展迟缓，还没有收到预期效果。各地各部门决定停建缓建项目虽达１．７万多个，压缩基建投资达５００多亿元，但其中在建的项目规模只２００多亿元，还不到计划压缩的１／４。过旺的个人消费需求没有得到有效控制，进一步膨胀的危险仍然存在。工业增长速度虽然减缓了，但产业结构没有得到应有的调整，不少该压的没有压下来，该保的没有保上去，尤其是长期供应紧张的能源、原材料生产没有上去，供需矛盾更加突出。交通运输更加紧张。经济生活中的许多基本矛盾仍然存在。对此，我们要有清醒的认识。
    治理整顿工作已进入关键时刻。当前的任务就是顾全大局，坚定不移地把十三届三中全会的方针贯彻执行下去。特别是压缩基本建设投资规模要坚定不移，稳定物价要坚定不移。
    压缩基本建设投资规模，是缓解社会总供需矛盾，抑制通货膨胀的最有效办法。广大群众对党中央、国务院有关这方面的政策和措施，都是赞成的。在过去几个月中，为什么远没有收到预期效果呢？主要是不少地区存在观望等待情绪，强调自己的特殊性，互相比照，生怕吃亏，因此不少应该停缓建的项目还没有停下来，有的还日夜赶工加快进度，以造成既成事实抗拒停缓建。有的地区，虽然把工程项目停下来，但仍抱有侥幸心理，以为像过去一样，紧缩的风头很快就会过去，不会等多久就能重新开工大干。这些同志没有想一想：不把过旺的社会总需求压缩下来，粮、棉、油供应老是那么紧张，交通运输老是那么紧张，煤、电、油等能源和原材料老短缺，整个社会经济生活就像一张长期拉满的弓一样，难免有一天要折断的。到了那时，十一亿人口人心惶惶，我们面对的不只是一个经济危机，而且是一个政治危机。况且，这一次治理、整顿工作，是结合调整产业结构进行的。该压什么，该保什么，不仅仅是为着解决投资膨胀问题，而且是为着今后整个国民经济的有计划按比例的稳定发展，对产业结构进行一次整理。正因为这样，党中央、国务院一再申明，治理、整顿工作一定要抓出效果来，两年时间不够，还可以延长，即使不得已采取一些行政措施，也不能半途而废。那种老怕吃亏，以为避避风头很快就会过去的想法必须去掉。对于那些不能增加有效供给的基建项目，对于那些不能缓解只能加剧能源、原材料供求矛盾、只能加剧交通运输紧张的基建项目，要主动下马，赶快下马。早下马早主动，自己主动，国家主动。躲是很难躲过去的，即使现在躲过去，把工程建起来了，将来调整产业结构的时候，也非下来不可！
