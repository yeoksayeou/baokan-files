The China Democratic League held its sixth plenary session of the third central committee in Beijing on March 29 and 30. The meeting firmly supported the government's work report, which proposed the policies and arrangements for rectification and deepening reforms, and required all levels of the League's organizations and all members to earnestly implement them.

The meeting strongly supported the Chinese government's condemnation of the U.S. Senate and the European Parliament's gross interference in China's internal affairs regarding Tibet. The meeting believed that the multiparty cooperation system led by the Communist Party is a fundamental political system that has historically formed and suits China's national conditions. Fully leveraging the advantages of this system is of great significance for promoting China's socialist democratic political construction. Improving this system requires all parties to create conditions and provide guarantees for multiparty cooperation. At the same time, all levels of the League's organizations must continuously strengthen their own construction, improve their level of political participation and consultation, and further play a role in adhering to, improving, enriching, and developing the multiparty cooperation system led by the Communist Party.

The following vice-chairpersons of the China Democratic League Central Committee attended the meeting: Gao Tian, Ye Duyi, Tan Jiazhen, Tao Dazong, Guan Mengjue, Luo Hanxian, Ma Dayou, Feng Zhichun, Kang Zhenhuang, Kong Lingren, and Xie Songkai.
