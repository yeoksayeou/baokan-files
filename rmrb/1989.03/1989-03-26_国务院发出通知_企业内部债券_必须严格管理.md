To prevent blind expansion of investment and increase in consumption funds, the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the management of enterprise internal bonds.

The _Notice_ requires that enterprises issuing internal bonds must strictly comply with relevant state regulations, adhere to the principles of voluntariness, mutual benefit, and compensation, and must not forcibly allocate. Government agencies, organizations, public institutions, and non-production enterprises are strictly prohibited from issuing internal bonds. Production enterprises that have not completed the purchase of national bonds are also not allowed to issue internal bonds.

The _Notice_ stipulates that the issuance of internal bonds by enterprises shall be uniformly managed and approved in a hierarchical manner by the People's Bank of China. The funds raised by enterprises through the issuance of internal bonds can generally only be used to supplement working capital. For those used for fixed asset investment, the investment projects must be examined and approved by the relevant departments, included in the national-controlled fixed asset investment scale, and the corresponding bank fixed asset investment loans shall be deducted. The term of enterprise internal bonds shall not exceed one year, and the interest rate shall not exceed 40% of the interest rate of the same term of the People's Bank of China's savings deposits. The interest income from bonds held by individual employees must be taxed in accordance with the law. In addition, enterprises are not allowed to convert production development funds and welfare funds into internal bonds for individual employees.

The _Notice_ points out that the shareholding system can only be piloted on a small scale at present. State-owned enterprises are not allowed to use the trial of the shareholding system as a pretext to arbitrarily convert state-owned assets into shares for managers, employees, and collectives. Collective-owned enterprises (including township enterprises) are not allowed to arbitrarily convert collective accumulated property into shares for managers and individual employees. Those who violate the rules will be deemed to have embezzled state and collective assets and will be held legally responsible. Those who have already privately divided state and collective assets must immediately return the divided portion in full. At the same time, relevant departments should handle the main responsible persons according to different situations.

    企业内部债券  必须严格管理
    新华社北京三月二十五日电  为了防止盲目扩大投资和增加消费资金，国务院最近发出关于加强企业内部债券管理的通知。
    《通知》要求企业发行内部债券，必须严格遵守国家有关规定，遵循自愿、互利、有偿的原则，不得强行摊派。机关、团体、事业单位和非生产性企业一律不准发行内部债券。未完成购买国家债券任务的生产性企业，也不得发行内部债券。《通知》规定，企业发行内部债券，由中国人民银行统一管理、分级审批。企业发行内部债券所筹集的资金，一般只能用作补充流动资金。凡用于固定资产投资的，其投资项目须经有关部门审查批准，纳入国家控制的固定资产投资规模，并相应核减银行固定资产投资贷款。企业内部债券的期限最长不得超过一年，利率最高不得超过银行同期限居民定期储蓄利率的百分之四十。职工个人所得的债券利息收入必须依法纳税。此外，企业不得将生产发展基金、福利基金转为职工个人的内部债券。《通知》指出，股份制目前只能在小范围内试点。全民所有制企业，不准以试行股份制为名，擅自将国有资产折股分给经营者、职工个人和集体。集体所有制企业（包括乡镇企业），不得擅自把集体积累的财产折股分给经营者和职工个人。违者以侵吞国家、集体财产论处，依法追究责任。在此之前，已经私分国家、集体财产的，必须立即将私分部分全部退回。同时，有关部门应区别不同情况，对主要责任者进行处理。
