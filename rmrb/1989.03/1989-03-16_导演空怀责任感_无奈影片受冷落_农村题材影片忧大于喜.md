Propaganda department officials have called for films to pay attention to the 800 million people in rural areas, describing it as a "forgotten vast land." Scholars researching rural policies believe that China's countryside is undergoing significant changes, and timely reflections in films can serve as historical records. In fact, amidst the wave of entertainment films in 1988, some filmmakers, with a sense of responsibility and serious attitude, produced several rural-themed films.

"Village Road Takes Me Home" (Beijing Film Studio) and "Desolate Snow" (Shanghai Film Studio) reflect changes in rural society and economy through personal emotional experiences. "The Women of Huangtupo" (Beijing Film Studio) expresses concerns about issues such as abandoning farming for business that have emerged in contemporary rural areas. The comedic films "Happy Reunion" (August First Film Studio) and "The Black-Faced Son-in-Law" (August First Film Studio) praise the growth of farmer entrepreneurs. On March 11, at a symposium jointly held by the Propaganda Department's Literature Bureau and the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, participants highly praised the enthusiasm and sensitivity of these filmmakers in reflecting real-life issues. However, they also noted that the artistic quality of these films is generally not satisfactory.

Director Wang Mengyuan of the August First Film Studio proposed that making films for farmers is a historical responsibility, while Director Dong Ke'na of the Beijing Film Studio called for artists to immerse themselves more deeply in real life. They also complained about the economic losses and distribution difficulties faced by their films: "The Women of Huangtupo" sold 43 copies and could not break even; the artistically refined "Village Road Takes Me Home" sold only 12 copies; Director Zhao Huanzhang, with his film "Happy Reunion," traveled through the three northeastern provinces but failed to sell a single copy. Someone remarked, "If the situation is like this for 'The Women of Huangtupo,' it's easy to imagine the fate of 'The Black-Faced Son-in-Law.'"

Some directors have called for the agricultural department to provide funding, while others believe that the distribution department's film orders are based on urban audience psychology and do not consider the needs of farmers. The reporter believes that such demands may not be realistic, and such criticisms may not be fair. Sun Changcheng, general manager of Zhujiang Film Company, recently returned from a survey in the rural areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Henan, bringing back meaningful information: farmers love to watch martial arts and thrilling films, but they also appreciate films with strong human emotions and moral themes; opera films have fallen out of favor. Family screenings account for a significant portion of rural film projection teams' business, but they absolutely do not watch tragedies. In some places, audiences say they dislike films about reform just by the title; the box office revenues in southern provinces dropped in January and February, due to cold weather, frequent snow, gambling, and the reduction in construction and migrant workers. Sun Changcheng said: Farmers do not have a platform to express their opinions, but their most powerful weapon of criticism is not buying tickets.

According to statistics, the number of film screenings nationwide last year decreased by 1.5 million (1.6 million fewer in rural areas, 100,000 more in cities), and the number of viewers decreased by 1.5 billion (1.3 billion fewer in rural areas). Officials from China Film Company believe that the main reason is the mismatch between domestic films and audience demand.

It seems that film creators need to better understand audience needs and be more self-reflective. Critic Peng Jiaqing believes: Such rural-themed films reflecting the era's changes and the mindset of people during these changes should be considered the mainstream of Chinese cinema. If even mainstream cinema cannot be widely appreciated by audiences, it proves that Chinese cinema is in crisis. How to fully artisticize mainstream cinema to attract a large audience needs serious study.

### 导演空怀责任感　无奈影片受冷落  农村题材影片忧大于喜

　　导演空怀责任感　无奈影片受冷落
    农村题材影片忧大于喜
    本报讯  记者李彤报道：宣传部门的同志呼吁电影应关注八九亿农村人口，称那里是“被遗忘的广阔天地”；从事农村政策研究的同志则认为我国农村正处于大变化时期，及时地在电影中有所反映，也能起到记录历史的作用。事实上，在１９８８年的娱乐片大潮中，仍然有一些电影工作者怀着责任感和严肃的态度拍出了几部农村题材影片。
    《村路带我回家》（北影）、《荒雪》（上影）通过个人的感情经历折射出农村社会和经济的变化；《黄土坡的婆姨们》（北影）表现出对当前农村中出现的弃农经商等问题的担忧；带有喜剧色彩的《喜相逢》（上影）和《黑脸女婿》（八一）赞颂了农民企业家的成长。３月１１日，在中宣部文艺局和广播影视部电影局联合召开的农村题材影片座谈会上，人们对这些电影工作者热情、敏锐地反映现实生活给予高度评价，同时认为几部影片的艺术质量大多不尽如人意。
    八一厂导演汪孟渊提出为农民拍片是历史的责任，北影厂导演董克娜则呼吁艺术家要更多地深入生活。同时他们也抱怨影片的经济亏损和发行困难：《黄土坡的婆姨们》卖了４３个拷贝，不能保本；艺术上颇为精细的《村路带我回家》仅卖１２个拷贝；导演赵焕章带着他的《喜相逢》跑遍东北三省，一个拷贝都没有卖出。有人说：“婆姨”尚且如此，“黑脸女婿”不问可知。
    有的导演呼吁农业部门给钱；有的导演认为发行部门订片是按城市观众心理，没有考虑农民需要。记者认为，这样的要求未必现实，这样的指责未必公允。珠影公司总经理孙长城刚刚去湖南、湖北、河南基层调查后到京，他带来极有意义的信息：农民们除了爱看武打片、惊险片以外，人情味很浓的写伦理道德的片子也大受欢迎，戏曲片已遭冷落；家庭包场占农村放映队业务的相当大部分，但绝对不看悲剧；有的地方观众说：最不喜欢的就是写改革的，听名就不看；今年１、２月南方各省票房收入下降，与天寒雪频、赌风盛行有关，也与压缩基建、民工锐减有关。孙长城说：农民观众没有地方发言，但他们最厉害的批判武器就是不买票。
    据统计，去年全国电影放映比前年减少１５０万场（农村减少１６０万场，城市增加１０万场），观众减少１５亿人次（其中农村减少１３亿人次）。中影公司人士认为，其主要原因是国产影片与观众的需求不适应。
    看来，作为电影创作者还需更多地了解观众需求，更自觉地反躬自省。评论家彭加瑾认为：像这样一些反映时代变革和变革中人的观念、心态的农村题材影片，应当称为中国的主流电影。如果主流电影也不能广为观众欢迎，则证明中国电影处于危机之中。主流电影怎么充分地艺术化，以吸引大量观众，需要认真研究。
