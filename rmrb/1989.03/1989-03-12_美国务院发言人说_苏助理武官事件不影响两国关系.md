	U.S. State Department Spokesperson Says
	Soviet Assistant Military Attaché Incident Will Not Affect Bilateral Relations

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 10 — U.S. State Department spokesperson Richard Boucher today told reporters that despite the Soviet government's protest over the U.S. expulsion of a Soviet assistant military attaché, this incident will not affect U.S.-Soviet relations.

	The U.S. State Department announced on March 9 the expulsion of Soviet Assistant Military Attaché Yuri Pakhtusov, accusing him of engaging in activities inconsistent with his diplomatic status.

	The Soviet Embassy in the U.S. immediately issued a statement condemning the U.S. action as "a deliberate provocation against Soviet diplomats" and denied that Pakhtusov had engaged in such activities.

	State Department spokesperson Richard Boucher said the Soviet Embassy had informed the State Department that Pakhtusov would return to his country.

	Boucher said, "There is no reason to believe this incident will affect our bilateral relations." He pointed out, "The Soviets are well aware that whenever the security of the United States is threatened, we will protect our country's security."

　　美国务院发言人说
    苏助理武官事件不影响两国关系
    新华社华盛顿３月１０日电  美国国务院发言人雷德曼今天对记者说，尽管苏联政府就美国驱逐苏助理武官一事提出抗议，但这一事件不会影响美苏两国的关系。
    美国国务院９日宣布驱逐苏联驻美国大使馆助理武官尤里·帕赫图索夫，指控他从事了与外交官身份不符的活动。
    苏联驻美使馆立即发表声明指责美国的这一行动“是对苏联外交官的蓄意挑衅”，并否认帕赫图索夫从事这类活动。
    国务院发言人雷德曼说，苏联使馆已通知美国国务院，帕赫图索夫将回国。
    雷德曼说，“没有理由相信这一事件会影响我们两国的关系。”他指出，“苏联人很清楚，每当美国的安全受到威胁时，我们将保护我国的安全。”
