According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd. (Reporter Zhang Qi) The international air freight transportation business jointly developed by China's China Foreign Transport Corporation and the United States' United Parcel Service (UPS) is expected to see significant growth this year.

The latest achievement in this development is that UPS has recently been approved to build a West Coast mail center near Los Angeles at Ontario Airport in California. This company is the world's largest express delivery company.

The facility, which will cost $68 million, is scheduled to be fully operational by 1995. It is expected that this center will begin operations later this year. Once fully operational, UPS's mail center will be able to process 40,000 parcels per hour.

With the opening of the mail center, the transportation of parcels between China and the western regions of the United States will become faster and more convenient. This will also facilitate economic exchanges and cooperation between China and the western regions of the United States.

　　中美两家公司合作开展国际空运业务
    据新华社北京３月３日电  （记者张琪）由中国对外贸易运输总公司和美国联合快递公司合作开展的国际空运运输业务，今年内将有一个较大的发展。
    这一发展的最新成果是，联合快递公司最近已获准在靠近洛杉矶的加州安大略机场建设一个西海岸航邮中心。这家公司是世界最大的联合快递公司。
    这个耗资６８００万美元的设施预计于１９９５年全部投入使用。预计这个中心今年晚些时候就可开业。全部开业后联合快递公司的航邮中心将能每小时处理４万个邮包。
    随着航邮中心的开业，中国运送美国西部地区、美国西部地区运送到中国的包裹将会更加快捷、方便。这也将有利于中国与美国西部地区的经济交流和合作。
