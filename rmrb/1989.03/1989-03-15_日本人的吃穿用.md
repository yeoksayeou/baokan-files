The majority of Japanese people eat "Washoku" (traditional Japanese food), and when they eat Western food, it is often Japanese-style Western food. Their main criteria for selecting food are convenience, high quality, soft texture, and small portions. They rarely indulge in heavy eating or drinking. Even at banquets, they do not extravagantly waste food.

American rice is cheaper and more abundant, and American oranges are tastier than Japanese ones. However, the Japanese government, to ensure the development of domestic agriculture, strictly limits imports, leading to significant trade friction with the United States.

During formal ceremonies, Japanese people prefer to wear "Kimono," preserving their national style. In daily life, they wear Western suits, but these are tailored according to their own body types and preferences by domestic manufacturers. Of course, they prefer Italian shoes for comfort and durability.

Japanese people value novelty, uniqueness, precision, and individuality in their daily consumer goods. Generally, they prefer domestic products. They do not wear high-end imported watches; some adults even wear inexpensive children's watches. In recent years, Japanese people have set up factories abroad, producing goods locally and importing them back to Japan, or importing cheaper goods from the "Four Asian Tigers."

The majority of Japanese smokers prefer domestic "Seven Stars" cigarettes, with few smoking imported brands. They do not have the habit of offering cigarettes as a sign of respect.

Japanese people prefer French perfumes for their pure and lasting scent. When buying foreign goods, they always look for the best value. Most Japanese people enjoy Japanese music programs. Few Japanese youth pursue international marriages.

Japanese people are very mindful of saving money, depositing any extra funds into banks. The government and community organizations have established various convenient and beneficial savings systems and methods to encourage savings.

　　日本人的吃穿用
    日本人绝大多数都吃“和食”，吃西餐也是吃日本化了的西餐。他们选择食品的主要标准是：方便、优质、软食、少量。很少大吃大喝。宴会上也不大肆挥霍。
    美国产的米多，价格比日本便宜；美国的柑桔也比日本的好吃。但日本政府为保证本国农业发展，硬是不准进口，以致与美国形成强烈的贸易摩擦。
    日本人在举行仪式时喜着“和服”，保留自己的民族风格。平时穿西服，但都根据自己人民的体型和爱好由本国精心制造。当然皮鞋愿买意大利产的，那是因为穿起来更觉舒适结实。
    日本人对日用消费品讲究新、奇、精、巧及个性化。一般说来，他们都喜用国货。不戴高档的进口手表。一些成年人也戴廉价的儿童表。最近几年，日本人在国外设厂，在当地生产，产品运回本国；或者从亚洲“四小”进口便宜货。
    日本的吸烟者绝大多数都吸日本产的七星烟，抽进口烟的不多。平时无敬烟习惯。
    日本人用香水愿买“法国造”，那是因为它香味纯正而持久。日本人买外国货总要图个实惠。日本人绝大多数人喜欢日本歌曲节目。日本青年追求国际结婚的较少。
    日本人很注意节约，多余的钱就存入银行。政府和群众团体为发展储蓄规定了一系列便民、利民的制度和办法。
