A Strange Incident at Chongqing Canned Food Factory: A Convicted Criminal Sentenced to Life Imprisonment Wins the Top Award

	Today, on January 10th, Chongqing Canned Food Factory held its 1988 annual summary and commendation meeting. A prisoner sentenced to life imprisonment, Chang Shikai, was awarded the "First Prize," receiving a bonus of 240 yuan.

	Chang Shikai was originally the deputy director of the Technical Renovation Office of Chongqing Canned Food Factory. During the technical renovation of the "insulated warehouse" project last year, he embezzled and accepted bribes totaling 80,000 yuan in cash. The Chongqing Intermediate People's Court sentenced him to life imprisonment and deprivation of political rights for life in December last year. The *People's Daily*, *Sichuan Daily*, the provincial radio station, and television station all reported on this case. However, certain leaders of the food factory believed that Chang Shikai had "merits" and decided to reward him heavily. This time, during the factory-wide evaluation of advanced workers for bonuses, ordinary workers each received 10 yuan, while department-level cadres received 40 to 50 yuan. However, Chang Shikai was given the highest award, equivalent to 24 times the bonus of an ordinary worker.

	While certain leaders of the factory were advocating for the criminal, they also sent "Liangyou" brand imported cigarettes and high-grade food to Chang Shikai in prison.

	(Editor's Note: The collusion between certain leaders of the factory and the criminal should be thoroughly investigated to uncover the truth.)

　　重庆罐头食品总厂怪事一桩：
    被判无期徒刑罪犯竟获头奖
    本报讯  今年１月１０日，重庆罐头食品总厂召开１９８８年度总结表彰大会，被判处无期徒刑的在押犯昌世开竟获得“一等奖”，得奖金２４０元。
    昌世开原是重庆罐头食品总厂技术改造办公室副主任，在去年该厂“保温库”技术改造工程中，贪污、受贿现金８万元，重庆市中级人民法院于去年１２月判处他无期徒刑，剥夺政治权利终生。《人民日报》、《四川日报》、省广播电台、电视台对此案都作过报道。然而，食品总厂某些领导人却认为昌世开“有功”，决定重赏。这次全厂评先进发奖金，一般工人每人１０元，厂级干部４０至５０元，而发给昌世开却是最高奖，等于一般工人奖金的２４倍。
    该厂某些领导人在为罪犯鸣冤叫屈的同时，还把“良友”牌进口香烟和高级食品等送给狱中的昌世开。
    （编者按：厂里的某些领导人与罪犯如此沆瀣一气，其中奥妙应查个水落石出。）
