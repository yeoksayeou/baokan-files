Recently, more than 3,600 young textile workers in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, bid farewell to the "mother-child buildings" where they lived with their parents and moved into new apartments, spending their first Spring Festival in the "Youth Worker Buildings." Zhengzhou has nearly 100,000 textile workers, who annually create industrial output value and realize profits and taxes that rank first in the city. To solve the housing difficulties of the workers, in 1987, Zhengzhou began to raise funds from multiple sources to build "Youth Worker Buildings." In just one year and one month, 64 residential buildings were completed, with a total area of 144,000 square meters.

　　郑州纺织青工迁新居
    据新华社郑州３月３日电  （记者尹道夫、通讯员李秀明）最近，河南郑州市３６００多户青年纺织职工告别了与父母同住的“母子楼”，搬进一幢幢新居，在“青工楼”里度过了第一个新春佳节。郑州市有纺织工人近１０万人，每年创造工业产值与实现利税均列全市第一。为了解决职工住房困难，１９８７年，郑州市开始多方集资建造“青工楼”，仅用一年零一个月，就建成了６４幢住宅楼，总面积为１４．４万平方米。
