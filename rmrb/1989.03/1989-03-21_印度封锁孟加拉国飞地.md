Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, March 19th.

Indian border security forces have tightly sealed off the Bangladesh enclaves of Dahagram and Angarpota in India.

The report says that due to the blockade, residents of the enclaves are unable to sell agricultural products in Indian and Bangladesh markets or purchase food, making their lives very difficult.

These two enclaves are located near the eastern border between Bangladesh and India, covering an area of more than 18 square kilometers with a population of approximately 15,000 people.

　　印度封锁孟加拉国飞地
    新华社达卡３月１９日电  据当地报纸今天报道，印度边境保安部队已严密封锁了孟加拉国在印度的达哈格拉姆飞地和安加波塔飞地。
    报道说，由于封锁使得飞地居民不能在印度和孟加拉国的市场上出售农产品和购买食物，飞地居民的生活相当困难。
    这两个飞地紧靠孟加拉国与印度接壤的东部边界，总面积为１８多平方公里，人口约１５０００人。
