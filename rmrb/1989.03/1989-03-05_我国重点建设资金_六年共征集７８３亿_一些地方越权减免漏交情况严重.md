Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 4th. Reporter Wang Jinhu reports: China began collecting the Energy and Transportation Key Construction Fund in 1983. By 1988, a total of 78.3 billion yuan had been collected over six years, with 18.3 billion yuan collected in 1988 alone. The concentrated use of these funds has promoted the construction of key energy and transportation projects, partially alleviating the "bottleneck" issues in the national economy's development. Simultaneously, it has played a positive role in balancing the national budget, covering fiscal deficits, regulating the flow of extra-budgetary funds, and curbing the inflation of total demand. It is reported that this year, the country will collect 20.5 billion yuan in Energy and Transportation Funds.

However, currently, some local governments and departments are arbitrarily creating loopholes and unauthorized reductions in the collection of the Energy and Transportation Funds, with particularly serious issues of evasion and non-payment. According to relevant departments, the amount of Energy and Transportation Funds that should have been collected but was not, reaches tens of billions of yuan annually.

　　我国重点建设资金  六年共征集７８３亿
    一些地方越权减免漏交情况严重
    本报北京３月４日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：我国从１９８３年开征能源交通重点建设基金，到１９８８年，６年累计已征集７８３亿元，仅去年一年就征集１８３亿元。这部分资金的集中使用，促进了能源、交通等重点建设，部分缓解了国民经济发展中的“卡脖子”问题；同时，也为平衡国家预算，弥补财政赤字，调节预算外资金流向，抑制总需求膨胀起到了积极作用。据悉，今年全国将征收能交基金２０５亿元。
    但是，目前有些地方和部门在征集能交基金中随意乱开口子，自行越权减免，特别是偷漏能交基金情况严重。据有关部门测算，全国应征而未征的能交基金每年达几十亿元。
