Wuhan, located at the "crossroads of nine provinces," bears a heavy responsibility for rail transport. For passenger transport, Wuhan Railway Bureau's Wuhan Station plans to issue 27,000 tickets daily, but there are over 60,000 passengers needing to travel. The 27 trains departing from Wuhan are almost always overcrowded, with some trains consistently overcrowded by more than 70% year-round. Freight transport is even more tense, with only 56.1% of freight cars meeting demand last year. Based on the actual situation of Wuhan Railway Bureau, Liu Zhijun shares the following views.

How can we break out of the long-term stagnation of railway development? As a commander of a grassroots unit in railway transportation, I would like to share some shallow insights.

Firstly, we must recognize the dual nature of railways. Railways are a fundamental infrastructure of society, primarily generating social benefits while also creating certain benefits for the enterprise itself. These two types of benefits can be combined to an appropriate extent, but the relationship between the two should not be misplaced. For a long time, on one hand, railways have been seen as a service industry, emphasizing high-quality service at low prices, viewing railways as a "pawn" in terms of social benefits. On the other hand, railways have been seen as a commercial enterprise, emphasizing low depreciation and high tax rates, viewing railways as a "chariot" in terms of economic benefits. This understanding and the corresponding policies it has led to have ensured that railways are caught in a double bind.

Secondly, we must focus on the external expansion of railway production. Continuously tapping into the potential of existing railways has been our consistent policy. Wuhan Railway Bureau has, through potential expansion and capacity building, reduced train tracking time to 7-8 minutes and increased the average train pulling weight by about 500 tons.

Thirdly, we must appropriately adjust railway prices. From Wuchang to Hankou by taxi, a distance of about 10 kilometers, costs 30 yuan, but from Wuchang to Beijing by express train, a distance of 1,200 kilometers, costs only 23.8 yuan. This illustrates how low railway prices are. Low railway prices not only make it difficult for railways to accumulate funds but also weaken the competitiveness of other transportation methods, making it difficult to reasonably distribute passengers and freight. To alleviate the overall tension in railway transportation and quickly form a comprehensive transportation system with railways as the backbone, it is imperative to adjust the overly low railway prices and rationalize the price ratio between railway transportation and other transportation methods.

Fourthly, we must gain the understanding and support of the entire society. For air transportation, an additional passenger means the plane cannot take off; for road transportation, an additional ton of cargo means the truck cannot start; but for railway transportation, even if the train is overcrowded by 100%, the green light will still shine, the whistle will still blow, and the main artery will not be blocked for a moment. Railways prioritize meeting social needs and social stability, therefore, they have long maintained overloaded operations. The situation and difficulties of railways need to be understood by the people. With the understanding and support of the entire society, many of the railway's issues will be easier to resolve.

### 认识铁路的“双重性”

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面？——交通运输总是讨论

　　认识铁路的“双重性”
    武汉铁路分局分局长  刘志军
    武汉，地处“九省通衢”，铁路的担子很重。客运，武昌火车站每天计划票额２．７万张，而要走的旅客达６万多人，武汉始发的２７列几乎天天超员，有的常年超员７０％以上；货运更为紧张，去年满足货主要车程度仅为５６．１％。结合武汉铁路分局的实际，刘志军谈了如下看法。
    怎样摆脱铁路发展长期滞后的局面呢？作为铁路运输基层单位的指挥员，谈一点肤浅的认识。
    首先，要认识铁路的“双重性”。铁路是社会的基础设施，其主要功能是产生社会效益，同时创造一定的企业自身效益。两种效益可以在适当的程度上结合，但不能把两种效益关系摆得不适当。长期以来，一方面把铁路看作服务性行业，强调优质服务低运价，在社会效益上视铁路为“卒”，另一方面又把铁路看作经营性企业，强调低折旧高税率，在经济效益上将铁路视为“车”。这种认识和由此确定的相应政策，使铁路注定受到两面夹击。
    其次，要抓好铁路的外延扩大再生产。不断挖掘既有铁路的潜力，是我们的一贯方针。武汉铁路分局通过挖潜扩能，列车追踪时间已压到７至８分，列车牵引重量平均提高５００吨左右。
    第三，要适当调整铁路运价。从武昌坐“的士”去汉口１０公里左右车费３０元，从武昌坐特快列车去北京１２００公里却只要２３．８元。铁路运价太低，由此可见一斑。铁路运价低，不仅造成铁路自身积累困难，同时削弱其它运输方式的竞争力，不利于客货合理分流。为缓解铁路运输全面紧张状况，尽快形成以铁路为骨干的综合运输体系，调整过低的铁路运价，理顺铁路运价与其他运输方式价格的比价关系，已经势在必行。
    第四，要让全社会理解和支持铁路。航空运输，多一名旅客飞机可以不起飞；公路运输，多一吨货物汽车可以不启动；唯独铁路运输，即使列车超员百分之百，绿灯照亮，汽笛照响，大动脉一时也不能梗塞。铁路以满足社会需要和社会安定为第一要旨，因此，长期坚持超负荷运转。铁路的处境和苦衷需要国人了解和理解。有了全社会的理解和支持，铁路的许多事情会好办一些。
