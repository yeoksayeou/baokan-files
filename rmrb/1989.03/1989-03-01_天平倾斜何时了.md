Title: When Will the Economic Scales Tilt Back?

When Western developed countries are savoring their sustained six-year economic growth, most developing countries are suffering from worsening poverty. Statistics show that in 1988, the average growth rate of the 24 developed countries in the OECD was 4%, while the average growth rate of developing countries was only 2.9%. If we exclude East Asia and South Asia, which have relatively better economic conditions, the economic growth rates of Africa and Latin America in that year were only 2.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Due to population growth, the per capita income in these two regions actually decreased by 4.2% and 1.5%, respectively. This reflects the widening gap between the South and the North, and the continued tilt of the world economic balance.

However, for most developing countries, the key issue is not the slow or stagnant economic growth rate, but the deteriorating conditions for economic development. In other words, they are facing not only a growth crisis but also a development crisis. The following facts can prove this:

	— Heavy debt burden: According to the World Bank, the total debt of developing countries in 1988 reached $1,245 billion, with annual repayments and interest payments alone exceeding $100 billion. The heavy debt burden directly weakens the investment capacity of the debtor countries.

	— Difficulty in raising funds: Since the debt crisis erupted, the way of raising funds in the international financial market has undergone significant changes. The trend of securitization of international capital flows is becoming increasingly strong and gradually replacing the previous form of commercial banks lending to developing countries. In this context, it is even more difficult for developing countries to raise funds in the capital market. After the OECD's investment in developing countries dropped by 20% in 1986, it further decreased by 10% in 1987. Foreign direct investment in developing countries also showed a significant downward trend.

	— Worsening trade conditions: Due to the recent softening of primary commodity prices and rising prices of manufactured goods in the international market, developing countries that rely mainly on primary commodities for exports and manufactured goods for imports have suffered huge losses, with cumulative losses since the 1980s reaching $147 billion. Another trend that cannot be ignored is that due to the rapid development of new materials and new technologies, many developing countries are also facing the threat of shrinking export markets for primary commodities.

It should be noted that for developing countries to truly get out of the predicament, it is necessary to carry out economic reforms and adjust their industrial structures. However, the improvement of the international economic environment should not be overlooked. In fact, the problems currently faced by developing countries are also problems encountered in the development of the world economy. The economic contraction in developing countries will ultimately have a negative impact on the commodity markets and capital markets of developed countries; especially the debt problem, which is no longer a short-term capital turnover problem. It is not only a heavy burden for developing countries but also a matter related to whether developed countries can develop smoothly. It has become a "time bomb" in the financial system of developed countries. If it cannot be resolved properly, international capital borrowing conditions will be seriously affected. Therefore, helping many developing countries to get out of the predicament as soon as possible and restoring the balance of the tilted world economic scales as soon as possible is not only the urgent task of developing countries but also an irresponsible responsibility that developed countries cannot shirk.

### 天平倾斜何时了

　　天平倾斜何时了
    孙毅
    当西方发达国家回味着他们持续六年的经济增长时，大多数发展中国家却正遭受着日趋贫困的磨难。据统计，一九八八年经合组织二十四个发达国家平均增长率为百分之四，而发展中国家的平均增长率仅为百分之二点九。若不包括东亚、南亚那些经济形势较好的发展中国家和地区，这一年非洲和拉美地区的经济增长率分别只为百分之二点五和百分之零点七。由于人口增加，上述两个地区去年人均收入竟分别下降了百分之四点二和百分之一点五。这反映出南北之间的差距日益扩大，世界经济的天平在继续倾斜。
    然而，对大部分发展中国家来说，关键还不是这些国家经济增长的速度缓慢或停滞，更重要的还是这些国家经济发展的条件不断恶化。就是说，他们所遇到的不只是增长的危机，而且还遇到发展的危机。下述事实可以证明：
    ——债务负担沉重：据世界银行统计，一九八八年发展中国家的债务累计已达一万二千四百五十亿美元，每年仅还本付息就达一千多亿美元。沉重的债务负担直接削弱了债务国的投资能力。
    ——资金筹措困难：债务危机爆发以来，国际金融市场上筹资方式发生了重大的变化，国际资本流动的证券化趋势日益加强，并逐步取代以往通过商业银行向发展中国家贷款的形式。在这种情况下发展中国家在资本市场上筹资更加困难。经合组织向发展中国家的投资在一九八六年下降百分之二十以后，一九八七年又进一步下降了百分之十。外国对发展中国家的直接投资也出现了大幅度下降的趋势。
    ——贸易条件进一步恶化：由于近年来国际市场上初级产品价格疲软、而制成品价格上升，使得以初级产品为出口主体、制成品为进口主体的发展中国家蒙受巨大损失，八十年代以来其损失累计已达一千四百七十亿美元。另一个不容忽视的趋势是，由于新材料、新工艺的高速发展，许多发展中国家还面临着初级产品出口市场不断萎缩的威胁。
    应当指出，发展中国家要真正从困境中摆脱出来，进行自身的经济改革和产业结构的调整是非常必要的，但是国际经济环境的改善也不容忽视。事实上，发展中国家目前遇到的问题也是整个世界经济发展中所遇到的问题。发展中国家国内经济萎缩，最终将对发达国家的商品市场、资本市场产生消极影响；特别是债务问题，已经不是一个短期性的资本周转问题，它不仅是发展中国家的沉重包袱，而且也关系到发达国家能否顺利发展的问题，已经成为发达国家金融体系的一颗“定时炸弹”，如不能合理解决，国际间的资本借贷条件将受到严重损害。因此，尽快地使众多的发展中国家摆脱困境，把倾斜了的世界经济天平早日恢复平衡，既是发展中国家自己的当务之急，也是发达国家不可推卸的责任。
