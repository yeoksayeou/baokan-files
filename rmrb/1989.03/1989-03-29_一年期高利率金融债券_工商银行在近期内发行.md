The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China will soon issue one-year financial bonds with a higher interest rate. A relevant official from the bank disclosed to reporters today that the bank's branches across the country will soon issue one-year financial bonds. The annual interest rate of these bonds is two percentage points higher than the annual interest rate of the same-term fixed-term savings deposits. Both urban and rural individuals can purchase them.

The official also announced that, considering the two interest rate hikes for savings deposits by the state in September last year and February this year, the bank will take appropriate compensatory measures for the financial bonds issued in 1987 and 1988 to protect the economic interests of bondholders.

It is understood that the bank has issued 8 billion yuan in financial bonds over the past four years.

　　一年期高利率金融债券        
    工商银行在近期内发行
    新华社北京３月２８日电  中国工商银行有关负责人今天向记者透露：中国工商银行全国各地分支行将在近期发行一年期金融债券，债券年利率比同期定期储蓄存款年利率高两个百分点。城乡个人均可购买。
    这位负责人同时宣布，鉴于国家在去年９月和今年２月两次调高了储蓄存款利率，为保护债券持有者的经济利益，中国工商银行将对１９８７年和１９８８年发行的金融债券采取适当的补偿措施。
    据了解，中国工商银行４年来已发行金融债券８０亿元。
