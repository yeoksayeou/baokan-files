Lebanon's internal conflict has escalated, with intense artillery battles between two sectarian militias.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, March 14 - According to a broadcast by Lebanese radio, the Lebanese Christian government army and the Syrian-backed Lebanese Muslim militias engaged in fierce artillery battles on the morning and noon of March 14, resulting in approximately 200 casualties.

The Defense Ministry building in East Beirut, the Presidential Palace, and the Beirut Port were all targeted by Muslim militias. Some Christian government soldiers near these facilities were injured in the shelling.

The Lebanese Christian government army, led by Aoun, retaliated by shelling the Aley region in southern Lebanon, where Syrian troops are stationed.

According to the latest reports, all Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon are now on high alert, with some units mobilizing to reinforce areas such as the Aley region in the Western Bekaa Valley.

The Lebanese Christian government army subsequently issued a statement condemning Syria and its supporters for creating a new "explosive" situation.

Meanwhile, the Muslim armed forces stationed in West Beirut also issued a statement, accusing the Christian government army of shelling residential areas in West Beirut, stating: "We know how to cut off their evil hands."

Lebanese Acting Prime Minister Hus responded to the March 14 artillery battles, calling for an end to "another round of violent madness."

According to reports, Hus has contacted some foreign envoys in Beirut, seeking international assistance to prevent further bloodshed in Beirut and Lebanon.

People's Daily, United Nations, March 14 - Correspondent Liu Kai Chen reports: UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today expressed regret over the escalation of internal conflict in Lebanon, which has resulted in the deaths and injuries of many innocent civilians, including children.

This was announced by UN spokesman Giuliani. The Secretary-General, who had just returned to the UN headquarters in New York after visiting several Asian countries, expressed "personal deep concern" over the government crisis in Lebanon and emphasized the urgent need for national reconciliation. Pérez de Cuéllar expressed support for the efforts of the Arab League's Lebanon Committee to mediate and hoped for their success.

    新华社贝鲁特３月１４日电  据黎巴嫩电台广播，黎巴嫩基督教政府军同叙利亚支持的黎巴嫩穆斯林民兵１４日上午和中午接连发生激烈炮战，约有２００人在炮战中死伤。
    贝鲁特东区的国防部大楼、共和国宫和贝鲁特港都遭到了穆斯林民兵的炮击。在这些设施附近的一些基督教政府军士兵被炸伤。
    以奥恩为首的黎基督教政府军进行还击，炮击了黎南部的阿莱山区，那里驻扎着叙利亚部队。
    据最新报道说，叙利亚驻黎全部军队都已处于戒备状态，有一部分部队正向西贝卡谷地的阿莱山区等地集结增援。
    黎巴嫩基督教政府军随后发表声明，谴责叙利亚及其支持的那一伙人制造新的“爆炸性”局势。
    与此同时，驻扎在贝鲁特西区的穆斯林武装力量也发表声明，指责基督教政府军炮击贝鲁特西区的居民区，声称：“我们知道该怎样斩断他们罪恶的手”。
    黎巴嫩代总理胡斯对１４日的炮战作出了反应，呼吁交战双方结束“又一轮疯狂的暴力”。
    据报道，胡斯已同驻贝鲁特的一些外国使节进行了接触，要求外国予以帮助以避免在贝鲁特乃至黎巴嫩出现进一步地流血冲突。
