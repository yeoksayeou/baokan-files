Title: The Unbearable Burden of Overseas Military Obligations

Currently, the United States' overseas military bases are facing a severe challenge. This challenge is almost universal, coming from every corner: In South Korea, the authorities, under pressure from anti-American sentiment among the people, have recently demanded that U.S. military bases in Seoul be relocated; in the Philippines, negotiations over U.S. military bases have stalled, and if no agreement is reached, the U.S. must withdraw from the Philippines by 1991; in Turkey, the parliament has consistently refused to ratify the U.S.-Turkey military base agreement reached in December 1986; in Greece, negotiations over U.S. bases have made no progress, and the Greek government has decided to close a U.S. air base near Athens; in Spain, due to strong public opinion, a major U.S. air force unit stationed there has been quietly withdrawn. In Portugal, Panama... U.S. military bases have also become targets of criticism.

The emergence of these phenomena is not without reason. After World War II, the United States, positioning itself as an international policeman and guardian of the Western world, established numerous military bases and facilities around the globe. To date, the U.S. has over 300 military bases overseas, with more than 600,000 troops stationed abroad, forming a vast network of military bases across Asia. However, after more than 40 years of historical storms, the justification for the existence of these bases has been shaken. With the growing national consciousness and strong demand for peace in the countries where these bases are located, and the declining control of the U.S. over its allies and the host countries, the local people have become increasingly intolerant of the presence of U.S. troops and military bases on their soil. Especially in the current climate of improving U.S.-Soviet relations, easing East-West tensions, and substantial progress in arms reduction, U.S. military bases, as symbols of hegemony and products of the Cold War era, naturally face broader criticism and condemnation.

From the U.S. perspective, its economic strength has relatively declined, and things are not what they used to be. Under pressure from budget deficits, U.S. military spending has seen a continuous decline in growth for four years. After Bush took office, he froze the 1990 military budget for a year. The Pentagon, accustomed to lavish spending, has had to "tighten its belt" and cut expenses. But where to cut military spending? A quick calculation shows that the largest item in the U.S. defense budget is overseas military expenditures, which reached $180 billion last year, accounting for more than half of the total U.S. defense spending. Clearly, maintaining such a massive expenditure has become unbearable. Recently, some insightful Americans have been reflecting on the U.S. global strategy. They believe that the fundamental reason for America's decline is that "the enormous overseas obligations are too disproportionate to the limited domestic economic capabilities," and whether the U.S. can maintain a strong position in the 21st century largely depends on whether the U.S. "stops acting as the world's policeman."

They also believe that the main threat facing the U.S. is not military security but economic competition. To deal with this competition, "the U.S. must shed its heavy military burden." These insights and advice serve as a wake-up call for U.S. decision-makers.

Of course, in the current situation where the confrontation between the two major military blocs has not been fundamentally eliminated and the international political climate is still uncertain, it is not realistic to expect the U.S. to abruptly abandon its overseas military presence. But the tide of the times has indeed changed, and decision-makers will ultimately have to choose the better path.

### 不堪重负的海外“军事义务”

　　不堪重负的海外“军事义务”
    张德真
    眼下，美国在海外的军事基地正面临着一场严重的挑战。
    这一挑战几乎来自每一角落，带有明显的普遍性：在南朝鲜，当局迫于人民反美情绪的压力，近日已要求驻南朝鲜的美军基地迁离汉城；在菲律宾，美菲军事基地谈判进展缓慢，如果双方达不成协议，美国必须在１９９１年从菲律宾撤走；在土耳其，议会一直拒绝批准１９８６年１２月达成的美土军事基地协议；在希腊，美希基地谈判毫无进展，希腊政府已决定关闭雅典附近的一个美国空军基地；在西班牙，由于公众舆论的强烈要求，美国驻当地的一支最大的空军联队被迫悄然撤离。在葡萄牙、巴拿马……美国军事基地也成了众矢之的。
    出现上述现象并非没有缘由。二次大战后，美国以国际宪兵和西方世界“守护神”自居，在全球建立了大大小小的军事基地和军事设施。迄今为止，美国在海外的军事基地已达３００多个，海外驻军６０多万人，形成了一个遍布亚洲的军事基地网。然而，经过战后４０多年历史风雨的冲刷，这些基地的存在的依据早已发生了动摇。随着基地所在国民族意识的日益觉醒和对维护和平的强烈要求，以及美国对盟国和基地所在国控制能力的日渐下降，当地人民对本国领土上驻扎的美国军队和军事基地越来越不能容忍了。特别是在当前美苏关系转向改善、东西方关系日渐缓和、裁军相继取得某些实质性进展的大气候下，美国军事基地作为强权政治的象征、冷战时期的畸形产物，自然受到越来越广泛的非议和指责。
    从美国自身来说，其经济实力相对衰落，今非昔比。迫于预算赤字的压力，美国军费连续四年增长幅度下降。布什上任后，又将１９９０年度军费冻结一年。惯于大手大脚的五角大楼只好“精打细算”，紧缩开支。可是，压缩军费从何下手？掐指一算，目前美国最大的一笔国防开销是海外军事支出，去年已达到１８００亿美元，占美国全部国防开支一半以上。显然，要维持这样庞大的支出已不堪重负。近来，一些美国有识之士对美国的全球战略纷纷进行反思。他们认为，美国衰落的根本原因是“巨大的海外义务同有限的国内经济能力太不相称”，美国２１世纪能否处于强大地位，在很大程度上取决于美国“不再充当世界警察”。
    他们还认为，美国面临的主要威胁不是军事安全，而是经济竞争。为了对付这种竞争，“美国要将过重的军事负担卸下来”。这些见解和忠告，对美国决策者不啻是一副清醒剂。
    当然，在目前两大军事集团对抗还未根本消除，国际政治气候乍暖还寒的情况下，不可能期望美国一下子放弃在海外的军事存在。但时代潮流毕竟发生了变化，决策者终究得择其善者而从之。
