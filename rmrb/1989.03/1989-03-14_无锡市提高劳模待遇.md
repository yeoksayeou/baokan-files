Wuxi City Improves Treatment of Labor Models

	The People's Daily reports: Wuxi City has decided to improve the treatment of labor models starting this year. In terms of bonuses, it is stipulated that a one-time bonus will be issued from the date the honorary title is approved. In terms of collective welfare such as housing, several priorities are stipulated. Additionally, regulations have been made to improve the retirement benefits of labor models. Ji Jiulin, Chairman of the Wuxi City Federation of Trade Unions, said, "Wuxi currently has over 800,000 industrial workers, but this year, only 300 people will be named as municipal-level labor models. This means that there is one municipal labor model for every 2,700 workers. Therefore, being selected as a labor model is a great honor and not easy to achieve, and it is only right to improve their treatment."

　　无锡市提高劳模待遇
    本报讯  无锡市决定从今年起，提高劳动模范的待遇。在奖金方面，规定自荣誉称号批准之日起，发给一次性奖金。在住房等集体福利方面，规定几个优先。此外，还对劳动模范的退休待遇提高作了规定。无锡市总工会主席吉久林说，无锡现有八十多万产业职工，但今年准备命名的市级劳动模范名额只有三百个。也就是说，每二千七百名职工才有一个市劳模的名额，因此评选为劳模是很光荣、很不容易的，理当提高待遇。
