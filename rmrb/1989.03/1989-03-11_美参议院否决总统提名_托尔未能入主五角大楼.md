The U.S. Senate voted this afternoon on the nomination of John Thole to be the Secretary of Defense. The result was 53 votes against and 47 votes in favor, thus rejecting the nomination. This is only the second time in nearly 30 years that the Senate has rejected a presidential nominee for a cabinet position.

Local media opinion suggests that the Senate vote was largely divided along party lines. Of the 55 Democratic senators, 52 voted against the nomination (only three Democratic senators, including Bensen, voted in favor), while of the 45 Republican senators, only one voted against.

In a statement to the television station after the vote, Thole said that he had undergone a rigorous review and had not violated any political ethics standards, nor had he neglected his duties. He stated that even though he would not be taking public office, he would continue to offer his opinions on national issues, contributing his knowledge, experience, and insights.

Democrats said they did not intend to harm the president but were merely fulfilling their constitutional duties, and that there was no question of who won or lost.

White House spokesman Fitzwater stated that the president did not view this as a personal conflict. He hoped to put the matter behind him, move forward, and quickly propose a new candidate.

　　美参议院否决总统提名  托尔未能入主五角大楼
    本报华盛顿３月９日电  记者张启昕报道：美国参议院今天下午就提名约翰·托尔担任国防部长问题进行表决，结果以５３票反对、４７票赞成否决了此项提名。这是近３０年来参议院仅有一次否决总统提名的内阁人选。
    此间舆论认为，这次参议院投票的情况大体上是按照党派区分的，５５名民主党参议员有５２名投反对票（只有本森等３名民主党参议员投赞成票），而在４５名共和党参议员中只有１名投反对票。
    托尔在表决后向电视台发表讲话时说，他经受了严格的审查，没有违反从政道德标准的事实，也不曾玩忽职责。他表示虽不担任公职，仍将不时对全国性问题发表意见，贡献自己的知识、经验和见解。
    民主党人称，他们不想伤害总统，只是履行宪法义务，没有谁胜谁负的问题。
    白宫发言人菲茨沃特称，总统并不把它看作是个人之争，他希望把这件事放下，继续前进，尽快提出新的人选。
