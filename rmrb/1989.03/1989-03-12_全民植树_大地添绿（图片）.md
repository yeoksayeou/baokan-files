    All Citizens Plant Trees, Greening the Earth
    The Women's Federation of Licheng County, Shanxi Province, requires each newlywed couple to plant at least two "Dragon and Phoenix Trees," and the parents of newborns to plant at least one "Baby Tree." This activity has quickly gained the unanimous support of young people. Currently, the county has planted over 30,000 "Double Happiness" commemorative trees. This is a group of young people from the county's administrative offices enthusiastically planting "Double Happiness Trees."

    山西黎城县妇女联合会要求每对新婚夫妇至少种植二株“龙凤树”，新生婴儿家长至少种植一株“宝宝树”。这一活动的开展，很快受到青年们的一致拥护。目前全县已种植“双新”纪念树3万余株。这是县直机关青年在喜植“双新树”。
