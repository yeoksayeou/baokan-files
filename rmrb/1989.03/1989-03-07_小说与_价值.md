	Fiction and "Value"
	Li Jingze

	The influence of pure literature is indeed waning. In fact, what is referred to as pure literature is mainly fiction. Because in recent years, it is probably only fiction that still has the qualification to "wane." Therefore, the question can be simplified to: What value does fiction have in today's society?

	Whether it is selling fake medicine or packaging counterfeit goods as genuine brand names, the group of people commonly referred to as the "avant-garde" is indeed a force on the literary scene that cannot be ignored or avoided. This is a group of "cosmic" philosophers who are always immersed in metaphysical contemplation. Language is their religion, and they find satisfaction in the reader's confusion and even anger. Thus, they form highly closed "circles." From circle theory to circle literature, there is a noble spirit of "all are drunk, but I am sober" permeating it. Artists are the most sensitive members of society. Their voices that awaken the deaf and blind are tools to shatter people's daily life illusions and laziness, but this means adjusting and reconstructing the world of human values. If the impulse to achieve the effect of "one person turns away, and the whole table is unhappy" is too strong, strong to the point of abandoning all survival values, this is somewhat insincere. Even the most exquisite techniques cannot cover up its artificiality and poverty. Works like "Visiting Dreams" (Sun Ganlu) have a structure, tone, and texture of language that dazzle the eyes and mind. This is indeed a bold attempt, but it is also a hopeless experiment. Stripping language of its indicative function and treating it as a physical phenomenon to play with, the most brilliant outcome can only be pleasing and moving dreams, and the rest is not worth mentioning. When Shklovsky and other Russian formalists emphasized the estrangement of language, they wanted to arouse and concentrate the reader's understanding of the true meaning of daily life through strange and "difficult" language forms, rather than turning writers into craftsmen of words. Of course, this is an extreme example, which, in an extreme form, represents the general state of valuelessness of those works. This is completely different from the desecration and destruction of existing values. Because the negative challenge to existing values necessarily contains a positive, constructive direction or desire, and this is a necessary factor for our culture to maintain vitality and continuous development, and it is also one of the basic cultural values of fiction and literature. In this sense, I have serious doubts about the value of these works.

	In recent years, works such as "Ancient Ship" (Zhang Wei), "White Whirlpool" (Liu Heng), "Fuxi Fuxi" (Liu Heng), "New Recruit Platoon" (Liu Zhenyun), and "Troubled Life" (Chi Li) have caused more widespread and lasting excitement. They are the small stars of fiction in 1987-1988. When people eagerly wipe off the dust on the plaque of realism, there is a lot of joy and sigh of "revival." But I think this is mostly a beautiful illusion born out of the eagerness to legitimize. In its original sense, realism as a literary phenomenon has disappeared with the passing of the 19th-century classical masters. As a method of creation and a way of cognition, realism today can hardly find pure descendants. In fact, the connotation of the concept of realism has expanded infinitely, to the extent that we often refer to works that have a spirit of entering the world and are realistic as "realism." I think the appearance of these works and the praise they receive are largely due to the attitude of facing and expressing the world with experience and reason being reaffirmed in literature. Fiction bears the cultural responsibility of providing a complete and clear worldview. This does not start with realist literature, but is derived from its source, although in the 20th century it has faced severe challenges in both the West and China, it has not been able to fundamentally shake the direction determined by human basic and profound cultural needs. This attitude itself is an effort to seek and establish a world of values. Whether it is the psychological analysis of culture or the penetration of the essence of daily life, in our society where values and survival values are disintegrating and reconstructing, their sharp critical spirit, clear wisdom, and even the compassionate heart of a benevolent person are all precious, and their creation is a constructive response of fiction to history, to life, and to its own cultural responsibility.

	However, even today, such fiction cannot expect to immediately produce a wide influence. Its dissemination range is quite limited. They not only face fierce competition from various mass media, but also in the face of the relentless expansion of their twin brother, popular fiction, they are increasingly straitened. In this context, some unyielding masters play a hand and show a few moves. Recently, there is Wang Meng's "popular novel" "The Ball Star Adventure." But the chances of success in this area are actually quite slim. The writer's effort to be "popular" and their understanding of life have deep contradictions, and it is difficult to reconcile them consistently. Didn't "The Ball Star Adventure" lose its momentum the more it was written, and become less "popular"? Because popular fiction, in its essence, is not just a set of techniques and a few moves, not just "readability," it is more a set of value concepts widely accepted by society, a worldly philosophy of life and dreams. Therefore, although martial arts novels are constantly innovating and romantic novels are constantly emerging, after many years, the value world they present has changed little. It can be said that popular fiction is one of the basic tools for cultural inheritance. It is both an indispensable stabilizer in culture and an inert agent in culture. The wish to inject modern consciousness into it and improve its artistic taste is likely to end in vain. If both are present, and at their peak, you can expect a Nobel Prize, but don't expect to have a hundred million sales in an instant. Pure literature competing with popular literature in the "readability" level has a bleak prospect.

	The value crisis of fiction ultimately occurs in fiction's response to the social value crisis. I believe that fiction should not give up the responsibility of renewing and elevating the national soul. All great literature has gained immortality and glory from this. As for the contradiction between the cultural value and commercial value of fiction, it is perhaps beyond human power to reverse. This may just be a return to normal tranquility from the previous years of lucky bustle. Fiction can guarantee its value and position in today's cultural system through its constructive role in the process of reconstructing the national value world, and this cannot be measured by market share.

### 小说与“价值”

　　小说与“价值”
    李敬泽
    纯文学的影响确在衰退。实际上所谓纯文学，主要是指小说。因为近年来，大概也只有小说还有资格“衰退”。所以，问题可以简单地归结为小说在当今社会有何价值？
    不管是卖假药，还是如假包装的正宗名牌，人们通常称之为“先锋派”的一群人确是文坛上难以忽视、无法回避的力量。这是一群“宇宙级”哲学家，他们始终沉浸在形而上的冥想中。语言是他们的宗教，他们在读者的困惑乃至恼怒中得到满足，于是他们构成了一个个高度封闭的“小圈子”。从圈子理论到圈子文学，其间贯注着世人皆醉我独醒的贵族精神。艺术家们是社会中最敏感的成员，他们振聋发聩的声音是打破人们日常生活错觉和惰性的利器，但这意味着人的价值世界的调整和重构。如果追求“一人向隅，满座为之不欢”效果的冲动过于强烈，强烈到遗弃一切生存价值的程度，这就未免不真诚，精巧的技术也无法掩盖其做作和贫乏。像《访问梦境》（孙甘露）那样的作品，语言本身的结构、色调和质地令人目眩神迷。这确是一次大胆的尝试，但也是一种无望的实验。剥夺了语言的指意功能实际上把它当成物理现象来把玩，这其中最高明的只能是悦耳动听的梦呓，等而下之的就不用说了。当什克洛夫斯基等俄国形式主义者强调语言的陌生化时，他们是要通过奇异而“困难”的语言形式唤起和凝聚读者对日常生活真正意义的认识，而不是想把作家改造成文字匠。当然，这是一个极端的例子，它以极端的形式表现那些作品普遍的无价值状态。这与对既有价值的亵渎和破坏完全是两回事。因为对既有价值的否定性挑战必然包含着肯定的、建设性的指向或欲望，而这是使我们的文化保持活力不断发展的必要因素，也是小说乃至文学基本的文化价值之一。从这个意义上，我对这些作品的价值深表怀疑。
    近年来，诸如《古船》（张炜）、《白涡》（刘恒）《伏羲伏羲》（刘恒）、《新兵连》（刘震云）、《烦恼人生》（池莉）这样的作品引起了更为广泛和持久的兴奋，他们是１９８７—１９８８年的小说明星。当人们就此迫不及待地拂去现实主义匾额上的积尘时，多少含有一种“中兴”的喜悦和感慨。但我看，这多半是因急于正名而产生的美丽的错觉。就其本意而言，作为一种文学现象的现实主义已经随着１９世纪古典大师们的逝去一去不返。作为一种创作方法，一种认知方式，现实主义今日也再难找到纯正的嫡派子孙。事实上，现实主义概念的外延无限扩张，以至于我们往往将那些具有入世精神的、写实的作品一概称之为“现实主义”。我想这些作品的出现和他们受到的赞赏，很大程度上是由于以经验、理性面对和表达世界的态度在文学中再度得到了确认。小说担负着提供完整清晰的世界图景的文化责任，这并不始自现实主义文学，而是从它的源头延伸下来的，尽管２０世纪它分别在西方和中国遭到了严峻的挑战，但都不足以从根本上动摇由人类基本的、深刻的文化需要所确定的走向。这种态度本身就是一种寻求和建立一个价值世界的努力。无论是文化心理的剖析或日常生活本质的透视，在我们这个社会价值、生存价值瓦解和重构的社会变革时期，他们锐利的批判精神、澄明的智慧乃至悲天悯人的仁者之心都是弥足珍贵的，他们的创作乃是小说对历史、对生活、对自己的文化责任一次建设性的反应。
    但是，今时今日，即使是这样的小说也不能再奢望它立即产生广泛的影响。其传播范围是相当有限的。他们不仅面对来自各种大众传播媒介的激烈竞争，而且在它的孪生兄弟通俗小说咄咄逼人的扩张下也愈显穷蹙。在这个背景下，一些不信邪的高手就玩上一票，亮了几招，最近就有王蒙的“通俗小说”《球星奇遇记》。但这方面的成功机会其实是相当渺茫的。作家力求“通俗”的努力和他们对生活的认识存在着深刻的矛盾，很难始终如一地调和起来，《球星奇遇记》不就越写越绷不住劲儿，越写越不“通俗”吗？因为通俗小说就其本质而言并不仅仅是一套技巧、几路招数，不仅仅是“可读性”，它更是一套为社会普遍接受的价值观念，一种世俗的生活哲学和梦想。所以尽管武侠小说花样翻新，言情小说层出不穷，但多少年过去，他们表现的价值世界却少有改变。可以说，通俗小说是基本的文化传承工具之一，它既是文化中必不可少的稳定剂，也是文化中的惰性剂。而那种想替他注入现代意识并提高艺术品位的愿望恐怕终将落空。这两条都有了，而且登峰造极，你可以指望得诺贝尔奖，却别想一下子有上百万的销数。纯文学在“可读性”的层次上与通俗文学竞争，前景黯淡。
    小说的价值危机归根结底发生在小说本身对社会价值危机的反应中。我认为，小说不应该放弃对民族灵魂的更新和提升的那一份责任，一切伟大的文学都是由此获得了不朽的生命与光荣。至于小说的文化价值与商业价值的悖反，恐怕非人力所能挽回，这也许不过是从前些年幸运的热闹归于正常的平淡。小说能通过它在重构民族价值世界过程中所起的建设性作用保证它在今日文化体系中的价值和地位，而这是不能用市场占有率来衡量的。
