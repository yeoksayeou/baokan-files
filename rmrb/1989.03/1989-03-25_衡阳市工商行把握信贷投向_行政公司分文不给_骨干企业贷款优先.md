The Hengyang Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has tightened control over new loan directions, strictly controlling various unreasonable loans, and prioritizing support for pillar industries, key enterprises, and flagship products.

To ensure that limited funds are used effectively, the bank has resolutely stopped providing loans to newly established administrative companies. In 1988, Hengyang saw a boom in the establishment of companies, with 554 companies formed in just one year. These newly established "companies" and "centers" all applied for loans from the bank. The bank adopted a strict policy of not providing any loans to these new entities, and throughout the year, not a single loan was issued to any newly established "company" or "center."

At the same time, for those enterprises with good economic performance, high foreign exchange earnings, import substitution, or those involved in the production and supply of daily necessities crucial to the economy and people's livelihoods, the bank has made every effort to arrange loans, prioritize investments, and ensure funding as much as possible.

　　衡阳市工商行把握信贷投向        
    行政公司分文不给        
    骨干企业贷款优先
    本报讯  记者贺广华报道：工商银行衡阳市支行把住新贷款投向关，严格控制各种不合理贷款，优先支持支柱行业、骨干企业、拳头产品。
    这家银行为把有限的资金用在刀刃上，坚决杜绝新开办的各类行政性公司的贷款。１９８８年，衡阳市兴起办“公司热”，仅一年内就有５５４家公司相继成立。这些新办的“公司”或“中心”纷纷向该行申请贷款。对此，他们采取一笔不贷的态度，全年没有为一家新办“公司”和“中心”办理贷款。
    与此同时，对那些经济效益好、出口创汇高、替代进口或关系国计民生的日常生产必需品等的生产供应、收购，则想方调剂贷款，重点投向，并尽可能予以保证。
