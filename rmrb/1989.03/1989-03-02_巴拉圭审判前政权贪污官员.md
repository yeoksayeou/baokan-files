Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 28th.

Paraguay's Supreme Court began trials on February 27th for former cabinet members of the previous regime accused of embezzling state property.

The first to be summoned was former Health Minister Adam Godoy. Godoy, now 65, was appointed by Stroessner as Paraguay's Minister of Health and Public Welfare in 1969. The court accused him of using his position over 20 years to embezzle state funds, using the money to build and purchase 40 high-end villas both domestically and abroad.

According to reports, Paraguay's Supreme Court will continue to hear cases of embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds by former regime officials until March 14th.

Paraguay's new President Rodriguez staged a coup on February 2nd, overthrowing the Stroessner dictatorship that had ruled Paraguay for 35 years. Following the coup, except for the former Minister of the Interior who fled to the Honduran embassy in Paraguay, 12 former cabinet members and high-ranking officials, including the former Health Minister, were arrested and detained awaiting trial.

Rodriguez appointed new Supreme Court judges on the 24th and instructed them to investigate and punish officials of the former regime for "embezzling state property."

    巴拉圭审判前政权贪污官员
    新华社北京2月28日电  亚松森消息：巴拉圭最高法院27日开庭审判侵吞国家财产的前政权内阁成员。
    第一个受到传讯的是前卫生部长阿丹·戈多伊。戈多伊现年65岁，1969年被斯特罗斯纳任命为巴拉圭卫生和公共福利部长。法庭指控他20年间利用职权，大肆侵占国家财产，用贪污的公款在国内外建造和购置了40处高级别墅。
    据报道，巴拉圭最高法院对前政权官员贪污、侵占公款案件的审理将持续到3月14日。
    巴拉圭新总统罗德里格斯2月2日发动政变，推翻了统治巴拉圭长达35年之久的斯特罗斯纳独裁政权。政变后，除前内政部长逃进洪都拉斯驻巴大使馆外，包括卫生部长在内的12名前政权内阁成员和高级官员均被捕在押，等待法庭审判。
    罗德里格斯24日任命了新的最高法院法官，并指示对前政权“侵吞国家财产”的官员进行“调查和制裁”。
