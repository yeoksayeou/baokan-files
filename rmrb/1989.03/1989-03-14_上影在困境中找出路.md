Shanghai Film Studio in Search of a Way Out of Difficulties

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai — (Reporters Zhao Lan Ying, Intern Zhu Dan) Last year, except for "Hibiscus Town," almost none of the films produced by Shanghai Film Studio had satisfactory box office returns. Perhaps the staff at Shanghai Film Studio have never felt such a sense of crisis as they do today.

From the end of last year to this spring, Shanghai Film Studio has been bustling with activity. Renowned director Xie Jin took the lead in establishing the Giant Star Film Company, selecting his own projects, hiring his own staff, operating independently, and bearing the risks of profit and loss. Following this, 16 mid-career and young professionals pooled their resources to establish the first stock-based film and television enterprise in the country — the Mountain Lion Business Company. A Tianma Film Company, which is partnering with enterprises, is also in the process of being established, and a video company is still in the planning stages.

Shanghai Film Studio is also undergoing reforms: workers who are not suited to their positions are being reassigned; all films that go into production must first pass through a consultation process to ensure both artistic and economic benefits; production costs and shooting schedules are being limited, and directors are being selected through bidding; the studio is adopting a director-centered system, abandoning the model of separate scriptwriters and directors, and instead adopting a model where scriptwriters and directors work together, with scriptwriters revising scripts according to the director's intentions.

　　上影在困境中找出路
    新华社上海电  （记者赵兰英、实习生朱丹）去年，上影厂拍摄的影片，除《芙蓉镇》以外，几乎没有一部片子上座率理想。上影人也许从没有像今天这样有一种危机感。
    从去年末到今春，上影厂上上下下动了起来。著名导演谢晋率先组建了巨星影业公司，自选题材、自聘人员、自主经营、自负盈亏。接着，１６名中青年集资建立起全国第一家股份制影视企业——山狮营业公司。一个与企业攀亲的天马影业公司也在积极筹建中，尚在孕育中的还有录相公司等。
    上影厂内部也在改革：对不适合工作者安排调岗；凡上机拍摄的影片，一律先要通过咨询，保证艺术和经济两大效益；限定成本，限定拍摄周期，导演进行招标；实行导演中心制，摒弃编导分管的模式，采取编导共管，编剧按导演意图修改剧本。
