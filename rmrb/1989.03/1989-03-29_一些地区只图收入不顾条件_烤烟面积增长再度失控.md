Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 28th.

According to a survey by the Rural Survey Office of the National Bureau of Statistics on the tobacco cultivation situation in 21 provinces and autonomous regions across the country, the national tobacco cultivation area, which had already increased by 40% last year, is set to expand by another 19.2% this year, reaching over 23 million mu.

Some local government departments, in order to collect higher tobacco leaf product taxes and increase local fiscal revenue, have disregarded natural and economic conditions. They have even gone against the will of the farmers, using fines and administrative measures to force them to cultivate tobacco.

The survey results from the National Bureau of Statistics indicate that the overall supply and demand for tobacco nationwide have already reached a rough balance. The uncontrolled expansion of tobacco cultivation areas may lead to overproduction and difficulties in selling tobacco leaves.

　　一些地区只图收入不顾条件        
    烤烟面积增长再度失控
    据新华社北京３月２８日电  国家统计局农村调查总队对全国２１个烤烟生产省、自治区烤烟种植情况调查后指出，全国烤烟种植面积在去年失控增长４０％的基础上，今年又将扩大１９．２％，达到２３００多万亩。
    一些地区的政府部门为了征收到更多高额的烟叶产品税，增加地方财政收入，不顾自然条件和经济条件的限制，甚至违背农民的意愿，用罚交税金和行政手段强迫农民种烤烟。
    国家统计局的调查结果表明，目前全国烤烟供需总量已大致趋向平衡，烤烟种植面积的再度失控增长将可能带来生产过剩和卖烟叶难的后果。
