	Old She Tea House Welcomes Guests

	Beijing has added another tourist attraction, the Old She Tea House located west of the Qianmen Archery Tower.

	The tea house is operated by the Beijing Big Bowl Tea Trade Group Company. General Manager Yin Shengxi is a lover of Chinese culture. He drew inspiration from Old She's stage masterpiece "Tea House" to establish this business, which integrates economy and culture, aiming to recreate the atmosphere of Beijing tea houses from 40 years ago.

	The tea house is situated on the top floor of the Beijing Big Bowl Tea Trade Group's shopping mall. Climbing the stairs to the third floor, one is greeted by a bronze statue of Old She, which immediately brings to mind the stage production of "Tea House," stirring up a strong desire to enter the tea house and enjoy a cup of tea.

	"Please come in for tea!" A young man dressed in a brown long robe politely invites guests.

	Inside the tea house, guests are seated around tables. Young women dressed in red satin qipao move gracefully among the tables, continuously serving tea. On the tables are plates of tea snacks such as Buddha's hand pastry, phoenix eye dumplings, and chestnut flour cakes, all with a distinct Beijing flavor. These snacks are not meant to fill the stomach but to provide a delightful experience for the palate.

	The performances on the small stage by the wall receive rounds of applause and cheers. The programs include Beijing opera arias, traditional arts, crosstalk, and acrobatics. Famous performers from the Beijing Opera Troupe and the Beijing Folk Artists Association often perform here. Occasionally, amateur performers or audience members take the stage to join in the fun. The tea house's stage is more intimate than a large theater, and the atmosphere is more intense. During the visit, guests can enjoy tea while appreciating the performances, truly experiencing a sense of "forgetting all unpleasantness."

	The tea house's furnishings and utensils are all antique-style. The central "pool," the "corridor" by the window, the "private room" in the back, the lanterns on the ceiling, the calligraphy and paintings on the walls, the red silk banner on the counter, as well as the copper teapots and tea sets carried by the women in qipao, all display the appearance of old Beijing tea houses. However, it is more elegant and lively compared to the ordinary tea shops of the past.

	The Old She Tea House is the first antique-style tea house in Beijing. Old Beijing residents find it familiar, "New Beijing" residents find it novel, and some foreigners regard it as a symbol of Chinese culture. A British friend, after visiting the tea house, left with this impression: "I have been in China for 7 years, and today I finally experienced Chinese culture."

	Since its opening two months ago, the tea house has been full of customers every day, with many visitors. Inbound tourists, foreigners living in Beijing, and compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan spread the word and visit in groups to enjoy the tea.

　　老舍茶馆迎宾客
    本报记者  梅洪如
    北京又增添了一个旅游佳处，这就是座落在前门箭楼西的老舍茶馆。
    这茶馆是由北京大碗茶商贸集团公司开办的。总经理尹盛喜酷爱中华文化，他从老舍先生的舞台名著《茶馆》得到启示，创办了这个融经济、文化于一体的实业，致力于再现４０年前北京茶馆的风貌。
    茶馆设在大碗茶商贸集团商场顶层。拾级登上三楼，见一尊老舍铜像迎面微笑。这使人脑海里骤然泛起舞台上的《茶馆》，诱发了进茶馆品茶的浓厚兴致。
    “请里边喝茶！”一位穿棕色长褂的后生彬彬有礼地向客人发出邀请。
    茶馆里面宾客满座，围坐在一张张八仙桌旁。身穿红缎子旗袍的秀丽姑娘在席间轻轻走动，不停地给客人沏茶。桌上铺着一碟碟茶果点心，有佛手酥、凤眼饺、栗子面窝窝头等，一色京味儿。不资饱腹，仅供嘴里消遣。
    墙边小舞台上的演出赢得一阵阵掌声和喝彩声。节目有京剧清唱、曲艺、相声、杂技等。北京京剧团、北京曲艺家协会单位的一些著名演员常到茶馆演出。偶尔也有业余演员、观众上台助兴。茶馆场子比大剧场集中，气氛更显浓烈。客坐期间，一边品茶，一边欣赏节目，确能获得“忘却一切不愉快”的感受。
    茶馆里的陈设器皿全都仿古。店堂中央的“池子”、靠窗的“廊子”、后边厢的“雅座”，头顶上的宫灯、四壁的名贤书画、柜台顶上挂着红绸带的幌子，还有穿旗袍姑娘手提的铜壶、托在方盘里的茶盖碗，等等，一切都展现古都昔日茶馆的面貌，不过比旧时市井寻常茶肆更高雅，更有生气。
    老舍茶馆是北京第一家仿古茶馆，老北京见了亲切，“新北京”见了新鲜，有的外国人则把它看成中国的“国粹”。一位英国朋友光顾茶馆之后留下这样的感受：“我在中国呆了７年，今天第一次得到中国文化享受。”
    开张两个多月来，每天茶客满座，应接不暇。入境旅游者，在京外国人、港澳台胞互相传递消息，结伴前往品茶。
