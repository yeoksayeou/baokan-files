After a decade of reform and development, China's overall financial strength has increased, particularly in extra-budgetary funds, which have grown from 34.7 billion yuan in 1978 to 227 billion yuan in 1988, with an estimated 245 billion yuan for this year. The significant increase in extra-budgetary funds has stimulated enthusiasm across various sectors, promoting the development of various undertakings. However, due to the rapid growth and poor management of these funds, as well as their improper use, they have also brought some negative impacts to economic life. It is now a task in the ongoing rectification and adjustment to rationally guide the flow of extra-budgetary funds.

In recent years, a considerable portion of extra-budgetary funds has been used for fixed asset investments and expanding consumption funds, further exacerbating the contradiction between total supply and demand in society. In 1988, the proportion of investment in total fixed assets nationwide, raised by local governments, departments, and enterprises, reached 60%. These funds have either been used extensively for non-productive construction such as buildings and facilities or for redundant construction and the development of processing industries. This has disrupted the balanced and coordinated development of the national economy, further aggravating the shortage of funds for key projects and making the irrational industrial structure more pronounced. At the same time, it has also driven the expansion of social purchasing power, leading to a sharp increase in consumption funds.

How to rationally guide the flow of extra-budgetary funds? One method is for the state to adjust the allocation relationship based on actual conditions, collecting a portion of these funds at a certain ratio to invest in key projects such as agriculture, energy, and transportation. This approach is also a way to "cut off the root" of using extra-budgetary funds for blind construction and expanding consumption funds. Recently, the State Council decided to start collecting the budget adjustment fund from this year, concentrating a portion of the extra-budgetary funds, and has formulated specific implementation measures.

Appropriately concentrating a portion of extra-budgetary funds to support national key projects is beneficial not only to the overall situation but also to local areas. Since 1983, China has collected the energy and transportation key construction fund to support key projects in energy, transportation, and other sectors. Practice has proven its effectiveness. Over six years, more than 70 billion yuan of extra-budgetary funds have been collected and concentrated for use, solving some "bottleneck" problems in the development of the national economy. Local governments have also expanded their financial resources from the energy and transportation fund, solving some urgent problems. Some enterprises have also eased the tension of electricity and coal supply due to the development of energy and transportation. This year, the new budget adjustment fund will mainly be used to strengthen agriculture and other key projects, aiming to create conditions for the smooth implementation of future reforms and development. Our comrades should correctly balance local interests with overall interests, recognizing that the temporary "concession" of local interests is for the long-term development of the whole. Only when the overall problems are solved can local problems be ultimately resolved.

Although the state needs to concentrate more financial resources, most of the extra-budgetary funds are still controlled by various regions, departments, and units. Therefore, decision-makers at all levels must, in accordance with the requirements of rectification, adjustment, and reform, seriously study and implement practical measures to guide the rational flow of extra-budgetary funds.

### 注意引导预算外资金流向

　　注意引导预算外资金流向
    经过十年改革和发展，我国总的财力有所增长，特别是预算外资金，已从１９７８年的３４７亿元增加到１９８８年的２２７０亿元，今年预计可达２４５０亿元。预算外资金的大幅度增长，调动了各方面的积极性，促进了各项事业的发展。但是，由于预算外资金增长过快，管理又不善，使用不当，也给经济生活带来一些消极的影响。合理引导预算外资金流向，已成为治理整顿中的一项任务。
    这几年，预算外资金中有相当部分用于固定资产投资和扩大消费基金，进一步加剧了社会总供给与总需求的矛盾。１９８８年，在全国固定资产总投资金额中，由地方、部门和企业自筹的投资比重达６０％。这些资金，或被大量用于楼堂馆所等非生产性建设，或被用于重复建设和发展加工工业，干扰了国民经济的平衡协调发展，使重点建设资金不足的矛盾进一步加剧，使产业结构不合理的状况更加突出。同时，也带动了社会集团购买力的膨胀，使消费基金猛增。
    如何合理引导预算外资金流向？办法之一是国家根据实际情况，合理调整分配关系，按照一定比例征集一部分预算外资金，投入农业、能源、交通等重点建设。这样做，也是对利用预算外资金搞盲目建设、扩大消费基金行为的“釜底抽薪”。最近，国务院决定从今年起征集预算调节基金，集中一部分预算外资金，并已制定了具体实施办法。
    适当集中一部分预算外资金支援国家重点建设，不仅有益于大局，也有利于局部。我国从１９８３年起通过征集能源交通重点建设基金，支持能源、交通等重点建设项目，实践证明是有效果的。６年间累计征集了７００多亿元预算外资金，集中使用，解决了国民经济发展中一部分“卡脖子”问题，地方政府也从能源交通基金分成中扩大了财力，解决了一些急需解决的问题。一些企业也因为能源、交通的发展，缓和了用电、燃煤紧张的状况。今年新征集预算调节基金，主要用来加强农业和其它重点项目，目的是为今后改革和发展的顺利进行创造条件。我们的同志应该正确摆正局部利益和全局利益的关系，认识到局部的暂时的“让利”，正是为了全局的长远发展。只有全局的问题解决了，局部的问题才能最终得以解决。
    虽然国家要多集中一部分财力，但是，大部分预算外资金还是由各地区、各部门、各单位掌握着，因此各级决策者一定要按照治理、整顿、调整改革的要求，认真地研究切实的措施，引导预算外资金的合理流向。
