The Youth Forest Protection Propaganda Team

Puyang City, a burgeoning oil and chemical industry hub in northern Henan, has a 2-kilometer-long East Ring Road. The rows of tall, straight Chinese scholar trees lining both sides of the road are a delight to everyone who sees them. The credit for this goes to the "Youth Forest Protection Propaganda Team" of Li Jialou Primary School in Mengke Township, Puyang City!

How was this youth forest protection propaganda team formed? Let's go back to March 22, 1988. That day, Li Xiaojun, the squad leader of the fourth squad of Li Jialou Primary School, rushed to the home of the student squad leader, Li Guoping, early in the morning. "Do you know?" he said, "The newly planted Chinese scholar trees along the East Ring Road have been pulled up by many people!"

Li Guoping was shocked: "Who did it?"

"Those who pulled the trees are all adults from the village. Some took them home to plant on their property, while others burned them for firewood."

Upon hearing this, Li Guoping was furious. Trees are state property; how could they be taken home by individuals?

To address this issue, they specially convened a squad committee meeting, and the instructor teacher was also invited to participate. To prevent the trees from being further damaged, the students discussed and came up with ideas. Under the guidance of the instructor teacher, they formed a youth forest protection propaganda team. The next afternoon, they went door-to-door to propagate their message earnestly. Some villagers, upon hearing the propaganda, scoffed, "Even the village cadres can't manage these things; what can you kids do?" The team members replied, "We may be young, but our words carry weight."

Since the team members began their forest protection propaganda activities, no one in the village has pulled up the trees again.

　　少年护林宣传队
    河南  马雪潮  李爱存
    豫北新兴石油化工城濮阳市，有一条长约２公里的东环路。路两旁齐刷刷站着的国槐树，谁见了谁喜欢。说起来呀，濮阳市孟轲乡李家楼小学的“少年护林宣传队”可立下大功啦！
    这支少年护林宣传队是怎样成立的呢？这还得从１９８８年３月２２日那天说起，这天李家楼小学第四中队队长李小军一大早就急急忙忙来到学校学生大队长李国平家，“你知道吗，东环路上新栽的国槐树被人拔了很多！”
    李国平吃了一惊：“谁干的？”
    “拔树的都是村里的大人。有的背回家栽在宅基地上，有的当柴禾烧。”
    听了这话，李国平可生气啦。树是国家的财产，怎么能拔回自己家里呢？
    为了这事儿，他们特意召开了队委会，辅导员老师也应邀参加，为了防止树木再遭破坏，同学们你一言我一语出开了主意。在辅导老师的启发下，他们成立起一支少年护林宣传队。第二天下午，他们挨户宣传得可认真啦。有个别村民听了宣传不以为然地说：“这些事村干部都管不了，你们小孩子能行啊？”队员们回答：我们人小讲的理不小。
    自打队员们开展了护林宣传活动，村里人再也没有拔过树。
