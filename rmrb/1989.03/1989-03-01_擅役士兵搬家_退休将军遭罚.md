Retired General Fined for Improperly Using Soldiers to Move

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 27th - According to a report by the Washington Post, former commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, James Lyons, was fined $3,420 for improperly using four soldiers to help him move.

An investigation revealed that General Lyons, who retired in October 1987, "exceeded his authority" by using four soldiers to help him move his personal belongings from Hawaii to Washington at the end of 1987. Lyons, however, stated that he only asked them to help him move files and other items.

A Navy spokesman said that the decision to fine Lyons was made by the Secretary of the Navy, William L. Ball, after a lengthy investigation.

　　擅役士兵搬家  退休将军遭罚
    新华社华盛顿２月２７日电  据美国《华盛顿邮报》报道，美国太平洋舰队前司令詹姆斯·莱昂斯因擅自使用４名军人为自己搬家而被罚款３４２０美元。
    据调查，１９８７年１０月退休的莱昂斯将军于１９８７年年底“越权”使用４名军人帮他把私人物件从夏威夷搬到华盛顿。而莱昂斯则说，他只是请他们帮他搬运卷宗和其他物品。
    据一位海军发言人说，这次罚款决定是经过长期调查后由海军部长鲍尔作出的。
