The first peasant painting society in China, which is entirely self-sustaining through the sale of its paintings, has been officially established in Jinshan County, Shanghai.

The Jinshan Peasant Painting Society was originally part of the Jinshan County Cultural Center. With the continuous implementation of reform and opening-up policies, peasant paintings in Jinshan County have not only made significant artistic progress but have also seen rapid economic growth. According to statistics since 1979, the income from painting sales has reached 855,000 yuan, with 308,000 yuan earned in 1988 alone. The society has now fully met the conditions for artistic and economic independence.

　　金山成立农民画社
    我国第一个完全依靠以画养画的农民画社，日前在上海市金山县正式成立。
    金山农民画社，原来属于金山县文化馆。随着改革、开放政策不断落实，金山县农民画不仅在艺术上有了很大的发展，经济上也迅速腾飞。据１９７９年以来统计，销画收入８５．５万元，其中仅１９８８年，收入达３０．８万元。已完全具备了艺术、经济等独立的条件。
