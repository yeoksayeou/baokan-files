Recently, I returned to my hometown, Nantan Village in my county, to visit relatives, and discovered that despite the fact that "Lichun" (the beginning of spring) had passed, there were very few manure piles in the fields. Why are farmers not paying attention to collecting manure? For this reason, I interviewed several farmers.

Li Baichun said: "Our village is right next to the county seat, making it convenient to collect manure. However, every winter, many people go to the city to do business and earn some money. Although chemical fertilizer is expensive, one can earn several yuan a day outside. Three or four days' wages can buy enough chemical fertilizer for an acre of land, but collecting manure in the city is too tiring!"

Qiao Yubao said: "Collecting manure in the city seems to save money, but it actually doesn't. My family bought a tractor, and theoretically, transporting manure should not be a problem. However, one kilogram of diesel costs over two yuan, and it is very difficult to buy. Running transport for a day earns thirty to forty yuan, which is both labor-saving and clean. Collecting farm manure is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and fuel-consuming. Earning money from transport to buy chemical fertilizer is more cost-effective than collecting manure."

Zhang Wubao said: "Farm manure is naturally good and has effects that chemical fertilizer cannot replace. However, who knows when the land might be redistributed? Now, few people are willing to invest in soil improvement."

　　农民为啥不愿进城积肥
    最近，我回到我县南滩村探亲，发现尽管“立春”已过，但地里的肥堆却寥寥无几。为什么农民不重视积肥呢？为此，我访问了几位农民。
    李白春说：“我们村虽和县城紧挨着，积肥方便。但是，每到了冬季，不少人都进城做买卖赚一点钱。化肥虽贵，可在外头一天能挣好几块钱。三四天工钱买的化肥足够一亩地用，而进城积肥太费劲了！”
    乔玉宝说：“进城积肥看起来省钱，其实并不省。我家买了一辆拖拉机，按理说运肥没有问题。但是，１公斤柴油要两块多钱，又很难买到。跑一天运输挣三四十元，既省力又干净，要积农家肥不仅费时、费劲，又费油。跑运输挣钱买化肥比积肥更合算。”
    张伍保说：“农家肥自然好，有化肥代替不了的作用。可土地说不定什么时候就打乱重分。现在很少有人在培养地力上下功夫。”山西原平鼓风机总厂办公室　曹申义
