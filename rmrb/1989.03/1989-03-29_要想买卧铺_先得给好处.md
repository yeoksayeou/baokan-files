On February 18, I boarded the 103rd train from Qingdao to Lanzhou in Xi'an and quickly went to the 8th car to the train attendant's office to handle the sleeper berth ticket. After passing Xianyang, there was still no one at the office. At this time, a train attendant from the 8th car sent out a passenger from the rest room, and then he poked me with his hand: "Come in and sit." I entered the rest room and handed him a pack of Ashmont cigarettes. This train attendant had the badge number "Qinglie 830."

He said, "Today, sleeper berths are very tight. Can your unit reimburse you for a taxi ticket?" I said, "No." He then asked, "Where did you buy this Ashmont? Would you like to try a pack? I'll get you a sleeper berth ticket." I gave him the cigarettes I had on me.

I came out, and Li Baolin from the Ningxia Heavy Industry Bureau Materials Department was called in. A few minutes later, the train attendant began to handle sleeper berth tickets for passengers. At this time, the train attendant with the badge number "Qinglie 830" walked into the office and issued two sleeper berth tickets for Li Baolin and one for me. When I went to the sleeper berth car, I found Li Baolin sullenly smoking. I asked, "Did you get shaken down?" He told me he was shaken down for 25 yuan.

　　要想买卧铺        
    先得给好处
    ２月１８日我在西安登上由青岛开往兰州的１０３次列车后，迅速到８号车厢列车长办公席办理卧铺票。车过咸阳，仍不见办公席有人来。这时，８号车厢一列车员从休息室送出一位旅客，接着他用手捅捅我：“来里边坐坐。”我进了休息室，递上一支阿诗玛香烟给他。这位列车员挂着“青列８３０”的胸号。
    他说：“今天卧铺很紧张。你单位能报销出租汽车票吗？”我说：“不行。”他又说：“你这阿诗玛在哪里买的？来一包抽抽怎么样？卧铺票我给你办。”我将身上带着的烟给了他。
    我出来后，宁夏重工业厅物资处的李宝林又被叫了进去。几分钟后，列车长为旅客办理卧铺手续。这时，“青列８３０”号列车员走进办公席，为李宝林办好两张卧铺票，为我办了一张卧铺票。我来到卧铺车厢时，发现李宝林闷闷不乐地抽着烟。我问：“是不是被敲了一杠子？”他告诉我，他被敲了２５元。
