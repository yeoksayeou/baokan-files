The Federal Presidency of Yugoslavia has issued an order to take special measures to control the situation in Kosovo. The chairman of the Kosovo League of Communists and two other officials have resigned. Albanian ethnic workers have begun to withdraw from the mines.

BEIJING, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Presidency of Yugoslavia issued an order yesterday: To safeguard the constitutional system, public order, stability, and the personal and property safety of all citizens, as well as the security of national wealth in Kosovo, special measures will be immediately taken in this autonomous province.

From February 26 to 27, the Federal Presidency held a meeting in Belgrade with the chairmen of the presidencies of all republics and autonomous provinces, as well as all high-ranking federal officials, and made this decision. The presidency studied various possible ways to rescue the health and lives of the miners in Trepča, expounded on the need for unified actions across Yugoslavia to overcome the current situation in Kosovo and the causes leading to it, and emphasized that the primary task is to normalize the situation there and restore trust among the peoples. The presidency stressed that it is most important for all social forces to work to stop various nationalist activities.

The presidency believes that the political situation in Kosovo is further deteriorating, directly threatening the social system stipulated by the Yugoslav constitution.

Yesterday, the Special Meeting of the Presidency of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia issued an appeal, urging the Albanian miners in Trepča not to endanger their own health and lives, and for the sake of their families, the Albanian nation, the entire socialist Yugoslavia, and the unity, friendship, equality, progress, and survival of all peoples, to withdraw from the mines. The presidency will, in accordance with the spirit of the Yugoslav constitution and the charter of the League of Communists, immediately study their demands in an open and democratic manner and make appropriate decisions.

BEIJING, Feb. 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Albanian miners in the Trepča lead-zinc mine in Kosovo's Autonomous Province began to withdraw from the mine at 9 PM tonight after an 8-day strike underground, thus avoiding the possibility of a tragedy.

The Albanian miners made the decision to withdraw from the mine after the chairman of the Provincial Committee of the League of Communists of Kosovo, Morina, the chairman of the District Committee of Pristina, Azemi, and the member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Shukria, announced their resignations today.

On February 20, more than 1,000 Albanian miners in Trepča began a strike underground, demanding the opposition to the amendment of the Constitution of the Republic of Serbia, the resignation of Morina and two other officials, and other demands. Their demands immediately received a response from Albanian workers and students across Kosovo, quickly forming a situation of a general strike and class boycott across the province.

To persuade the Albanian miners to stop the strike and leave the mine, the chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Shuvari, personally went down to the mine to talk with the strikers, but without success. The Albanian workers firmly demanded the resignation of Morina and two other officials as a precondition for leaving the mine.

Due to the prolonged stay underground, the health condition of the Albanian miners continued to deteriorate, and so far, more than 600 have received treatment.

However, the resignation of Morina and two other officials today has caused strong dissatisfaction among the Serbian and Montenegrin residents in Kosovo. They have held multiple protest rallies in Kosovo Polje and other places, opposing the resignation of Morina and two other officials, believing that this is a concession to Albanian nationalist and separatist forces.

　　南斯拉夫联邦主席团发布命令
    采取特别措施控制科索沃局势
    科索沃共盟主席等三人辞职　阿族罢工工人开始撤离矿井
    本报贝尔格莱德２月２８日电  记者严正报道：南斯拉夫联邦主席团昨天又颁布一道命令：为了保卫科索沃的宪法制度、公共秩序、安定和所有公民的人身、财产安全以及国家财富的安全，立即在这个自治省采取特别措施。
    ２月２６—２７日南联邦主席团在贝尔格莱德举行了各共和国、自治省主席团主席和所有联邦高级官员也参加的会议，并作出此项决定。主席团研究了救护特雷普查矿工健康和生命的各种可能的办法，阐述了要采取全南斯拉夫的统一行动以克服科索沃目前的状况以及导致这种状况的原因，其中首先要使那里的局势正常化，恢复各族人民间的信任。主席团强调最重要的是所有社会力量都要努力制止各种民族主义的活动。
    主席团认为，科索沃政治局势进一步恶化，直接威胁南宪法规定的社会制度。
    昨天，南共联盟主席团特别会议发出呼吁，要求特雷普查阿尔巴尼亚族矿工不再威胁自己的健康和生命，也为了有利于自己的家庭、阿尔巴尼亚民族、整个社会主义的南斯拉夫，各族人民的团结友爱、平等及其进步和生存，撤离矿井。主席团将根据南宪法和共盟章程的精神，立即以公开的民主的方式研究他们的要求，并作出合适的决定。
    新华社贝尔格莱德２月２７日电　（记者徐坤明）南斯拉夫科索沃自治省特雷普查铅锌矿１０００多名阿尔巴尼亚族矿工在矿井下罢工８天后于今晚９点钟开始撤离矿井，从而避免了发生悲剧的可能性。
    阿族矿工是在科索沃共盟省委主席团主席莫里纳、普里什蒂纳区委主席团主席阿泽米和南共联盟中央委员舒克里亚今天宣布辞职后作出撤离矿井的决定的。
    ２月２０日，特雷普查１０００多名阿族矿工开始在矿井下举行罢工，提出了反对修改塞尔维亚共和国宪法、要求莫里纳等３人辞职等多项要求。他们的要求立即得到了科索沃各地阿族工人和学生的响应，迅速形成了全省阿族人总罢工、总罢课的局面。
    为了劝说阿族矿工停止罢工走出矿井，南共联盟中央主席团主席舒瓦尔曾亲自下矿井与罢工者对话，但未获得成功。阿族工人坚决要求莫里纳等３人辞职，以此作为走出矿井的先决条件。
    由于长时间呆在矿井下，阿族矿工的健康状况不断恶化，至今已有６００多人接受治疗。
    然而，莫里纳等人的辞职今天引起了科索沃塞尔维亚族和黑山族居民的强烈不满。他们在科索沃波列等地多次举行抗议集会，反对莫里纳等人辞职，认为这是“对阿尔巴尼亚族民族主义和分离主义势力的让步”。
