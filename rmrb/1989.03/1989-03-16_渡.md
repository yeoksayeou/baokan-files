The son of the mountain has grown up. Surrounding him are nothing but steep cliffs and tall, dense forests. He feels suffocated and wants to go out and see the world outside.

He finally walks out of the mountain's prison.

Just as he reveals a hint of a victorious smile, a surging river blocks his path.

The sunshine on the other side is invitingly bright, and the plains are an unaccustomed flatness…

At this moment, a rainbow appears on the river surface, a vivid seven-colored rainbow. One end of the rainbow is on this shore, and the other end is on the opposite shore. He is overjoyed and wants to leap onto the rainbow and dash to the other side of the river. As soon as he lifts his leg, he falls into the relentless river water.

After gulping a few mouthfuls of water, he suddenly realizes: I am only familiar with the mountains and not the rivers. Blindly moving forward will lead to disaster. To cross rivers, one must build boats and bridges… He resolutely turns around and climbs back onto the shore.

By the river, the sound of chopping wood for rafts begins…

    胡永康
    山的儿子已经长大。他的四周除了陡峭的山崖，就是高大浓密的林木。他感到窒息，要出去看看外面的世界。
    他终于走出了山的囹圄。
    刚露出一丝胜利的微笑，一条汹涌的大河又阻挡在前。
    对岸的阳光是诱人的明媚，原野是从未见过的平坦……
    这时，河面上出现一道虹，一道七彩绚丽的虹。虹的一端在此岸，另一端在彼岸。他欣喜若狂，想一步跃上彩虹，奔到河对岸去。刚一抬腿，却跌进滔滔无情的河水中。
    呛了几口水，他猛然省悟：我只熟悉山而不谙悉水。盲目向前将有灭顶之灾。欲渡江河，唯有造舟建桥……他毅然转过身，爬上岸来。
    河边，响起了叮叮的筏木声……
