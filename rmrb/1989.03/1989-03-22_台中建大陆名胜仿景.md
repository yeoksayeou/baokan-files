    "No need to cross the sea, just visit Guilin." Replicas of mainland scenic spots have recently made their debut in Taichung City.

    The *Business Times* reports that since the opening of mainland visits for family reunions, a wave of mainland fever has swept across Taiwan, even influencing the construction of amusement areas, which have caught the trend of imitating mainland landscapes. The most representative example is Taichung's Dongshan Amusement Park.

    Dongshan Amusement Park is situated by the mountains and beside the water. The first phase of the project, covering eight hectares, has been completed. The park's main attractions feature the landscapes of Guilin and the Li River, showcasing unique and varied scenery. It highlights the "five wonders" of Guilin: green mountains, clear waters, beautiful rocks, strange caves, and fragrant osmanthus.

    东山乐园依山傍水，目前已完成第一期工程八公顷设施。园内主要的景色首推桂林山水及漓江风光，其造景奇特，姿态万千，表现了“山青、水秀、石美、洞奇、桂香”五大特色。
