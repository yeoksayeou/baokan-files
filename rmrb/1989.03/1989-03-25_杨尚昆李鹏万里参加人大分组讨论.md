State Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Yang Shangkun attended the discussion of the government work report by the PLA delegation this afternoon. He pointed out that the military must maintain the tradition of hard work and frugality, live a tight life, and consider the overall situation of the country.

Before Yang Shangkun spoke, some representatives reflected on the difficulties faced by the troops. Yang Shangkun commented on this, saying, "We who work in the military all hope that the military equipment will be better and the combat effectiveness will be higher. This is understandable. But the growth rate of military expenditure depends on the country's financial strength. As the saying goes, a rich country can have a strong army. If the country is not rich, the army cannot be strong. Once production develops and the country becomes rich and strong, military expenditure can be increased. With limited military expenditure, how should we spend it? I still say, good steel should be used on the blade, and money should be spent on key points. From high-level leaders to the grassroots, everyone must be frugal and oppose extravagance and waste."

Yang Shangkun said, "Comrade Deng Xiaoping mentioned yesterday that one of our biggest mistakes in the past ten years is that we did not tell the people and Party members to maintain the tradition of hard work and frugality. This is very important. If the tradition of hard work and frugality had been maintained, there might be fewer phenomena of extravagance and waste, corruption, and bribery today. The military has maintained the tradition of hard work and frugality over the past few years, but in some places, this tradition has been weakened or even forgotten. The tradition of hard work and frugality in the military must be maintained and carried forward. I support the campaign to 'learn from Lei Feng.' The military must have the spirit of hard work and self-sacrifice."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Premier Li Peng today participated in the discussion of the Sichuan delegation at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress. He said that through rectification and reform, it will be more conducive to opening up.

Li Peng said, "The purpose of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening the reform is to overcome the current difficulties and create a good environment for reform and opening up, not to go back to the old path." He said, "In the process of rectification and reform, we should use economic, administrative, legal, disciplinary, and propaganda and education means. In the long run, we should use more economic means, but in the reality of China, especially during the period of rectification and reform, we also need necessary administrative means. Of course, when we use administrative means, we should try to make them standardized and legalized to reduce arbitrariness."

Li Peng also pointed out that during the rectification and reform, the people of the whole country should be prepared to live a tight life for a few years. This means that we should reduce the scale of large-scale construction, suppress excessive consumption demand, and slow down the rate of growth. We have indeed encountered many difficulties, but this is different from the 1960s when the people were asked to tighten their belts and live a hard life for a few years. Now, we are facing difficulties in the process of advancement. Our economy is in a period of growth. He emphasized that during the period of rectification and reform, economic construction should still develop at an appropriate speed, and people's lives will still improve, although the speed of improvement will be slower.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Wan Li attended the discussion of the Beijing delegation on the government work report this afternoon. He proposed that people's representatives should play a leading and supervisory role in all aspects of work.

Representatives in their speeches mentioned the problems of coal shortage, power outages, and water scarcity in Beijing, which caused inconvenience to the lives of the people. After hearing this, Wan Li, as a representative of the people, appealed to the Minister of Energy Huang Yiceng to do his best to ensure the power supply in Beijing. Afterwards, Huang Yiceng introduced the production and development of coal and electricity in Beijing and the country last year, as well as the current reasons for the tight supply. Wan Li hoped that the Ministry of Energy and Beijing Municipality would, on the one hand, adopt the method of the whole people and collective to speed up the construction of projects, and on the other hand, take measures to save electricity. He inquired about the population, cars, and environmental pollution in Beijing. He said, "The capital is a window to observe the whole country and is also a miniature of our ancient civilization. The spiritual civilization construction of the capital is watched by people at home and abroad. I hope that Beijing will do well in all aspects, and the representatives of Beijing will play a leading role in all work."

　　杨尚昆李鹏万里参加人大分组讨论
    据新华社北京３月２４日电  （记者羊慧明、李志勇）国家主席、中央军委常务副主席杨尚昆代表今天下午在参加解放军代表团审议政府工作报告时指出，军队要保持艰苦奋斗的传统，过紧日子，顾全国家大局。
    在杨尚昆发言之前，有的代表在发言中反映了部队面临的困难。杨尚昆就此发表意见说，我们做军队工作的，都希望军队装备更好一点，战斗力更提高一点，这可以理解。但军费的增长幅度取决于国家的财力。古话说，富国才能强兵。国不富，兵也强不了。生产发展了，国家富强起来，军费就能增加多一点。有限的军费，我们怎么花？我还是那句老话：好钢要用在刀刃上，钱要花在点子上。从高级领导到基层，都要节约，要反对铺张浪费。
    杨尚昆说，邓小平同志昨天讲，我们这十年最大的失误之一，就是没有告诉人民和共产党员要保持艰苦奋斗的传统，这一点很重要。如果艰苦奋斗的传统一直保持下来，今天的奢侈浪费、贪污受贿等现象就可能少一些。军队这几年艰苦奋斗的传统还是保留下来了，但是在有些地方也有所削弱甚至忘掉了这个传统。军队艰苦奋斗的传统一定要保持和发扬光大。开展“学雷锋”活动，我赞成。军队就得要有吃苦牺牲的精神。
    据新华社北京３月２４日电　（记者朱世龙、刘晓行）国务院总理李鹏今天在参加七届全国人大二次会议四川省代表团的讨论时说，通过治理整顿将更有利于改革开放。
    李鹏说，治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、深化改革的目的是为了克服当前的困难，为改革开放创造良好的环境，不是走回头路，他说，在治理整顿中，我们要运用经济、行政、法律、纪律和宣传教育等各种手段。从长远来看，更多还是要运用经济手段，但是在中国的现实情况下，特别是在治理整顿时期，也要有必不可少的行政手段。当然，我们在采用行政手段时，要尽量使之规范化、法制化，以减少随意性。
    李鹏还指出，在治理整顿中，全国人民要有过几年紧日子的思想准备，这就是说，要把过大的基建规模压缩下来，要把过高的消费需求抑制下来，要把过快的增长速度放慢下来。我们确实遇到了许多困难，但是，这并不同于６０年代，当时要求人民勒紧裤带过几年苦日子。现在，我们遇到的是前进中的困难，我们的经济处于上升时期。他强调说，在治理整顿期间，经济建设还是要以一个适当的速度发展，人民的生活仍会有所改善，不过改善的速度要放慢一点。
    新华社北京３月２４日电　（记者王进业、陈宪鑫）全国人大常委会委员长万里代表今天下午在参加北京代表团审议政府工作报告的会议时提出，人大代表应该在各方面的工作中发挥带头和监督作用。
    代表们在发言中谈到北京缺煤、停电和用水紧张，给老百姓生活造成不便的问题。万里听后对在场的能源部部长黄毅诚说：“我作为一名人民的代表为老百姓呼吁，要设法保证北京用电。”之后，黄毅诚向代表们介绍了全国和北京去年煤电的生产发展情况和当前供应紧张的原因。万里希望能源部和北京市一方面要采取全民和集体一齐上的办法抓紧项目建设，一方面采取措施节约用电。他询问了北京的人口、汽车、环境污染等情况。他说，首都是观察全国的窗口，也是我们文明古国的缩影，首都的精神文明建设为国内外人士所注目。他希望北京在各方面都要搞好，北京的代表们在各项工作中要起带头作用。
