Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 12th.

East German leader Erich Honecker today in Leipzig said that the German Democratic Republic (GDR) attaches great importance to developing relations with the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG).

Honecker made the remarks during a meeting with the Premier of West Germany's North Rhine-Westphalia state and Deputy Chairman of the West German Social Democratic Party, Johannes Rau, who came to participate in the 1989 Leipzig Spring Fair.

He stressed that the GDR will unswervingly work to implement the agreements reached during his 1987 visit to Bonn for the development of bilateral relations and hopes that the FRG will do the same.

He said that as long as there is mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and each other's interests, and non-interference in internal affairs, relations between the two countries will develop in a healthy manner.

Honecker also advocated that both Germanys should pursue policies that contribute to mutual security, hoping that the FRG could follow the example of the GDR and take the lead in disarmament among NATO countries.

Johannes Rau raised the issue of the two shooting incidents that occurred at the West Berlin border at the end of February and on March 10th during his meeting with Honecker. Honecker hoped that the development of relations between the two Germanys would not be disrupted by such incidents.

Honecker today, while visiting the Federal Republic of Germany's exhibition stand, emphasized that the two Germanys should strengthen cooperation not only in the political sphere but also in the economic and technological fields. He also proposed that the two Germanys could cooperate in third-country markets.
