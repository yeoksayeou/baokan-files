The three factions of Democratic Kampuchea reaffirmed that the five-point peace proposal by Democratic Kampuchea Chairman Sihanouk is the basis for solving the Kampuchean problem.

The statement emphasized that the three factions insist that Vietnam must withdraw all its troops from Kampuchea according to a clear timetable and under international supervision; achieve national reconciliation within Kampuchea; and establish a four-party interim government led by Sihanouk.

The statement reiterated that after Vietnam's withdrawal, Kampuchea needs two international supervisory bodies: one is the United Nations Supervisory Commission, responsible for supervising Vietnam's withdrawal and the disarmament of surplus armed forces of the four factions; the other is the United Nations Peacekeeping Force, responsible for preventing any one faction from monopolizing power, preventing civil war, and preventing Vietnam from re-invading Kampuchea.

	New Delhi, February 28 (Xinhua) - Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila held talks with visiting Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach on the Kampuchean issue tonight.

	Nguyen Co Thach arrived in Bangkok this afternoon after concluding a four-day visit to Malaysia and will stay in Thailand for three days.

	Siddhi told the press after the talks that both sides discussed how to achieve results quickly in politically solving the Kampuchean issue after the second Jakarta informal meeting.

	Nguyen Co Thach told the press that Vietnam will withdraw all its troops from Kampuchea by September this year only after the Kampuchean factions resolve their issues among themselves.

	He claimed that the "international aspect of the Kampuchean issue has been resolved," leaving only the "domestic aspect" to be resolved. Local diplomats pointed out that Nguyen Co Thach's statement is groundless given that 120,000 Vietnamese troops are still stationed in Kampuchea.

	Nguyen Co Thach also reiterated Vietnam's rejection of the United Nations' role in seeking a political solution to the Kampuchean issue and accused the United Nations of being biased in the Kampuchean issue.

    民柬三方重申五点建议为基础
    阮基石仍坚持越南撤军有条件
    新华社北京3月1日电　据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，民柬联合政府出席关于柬埔寨问题的第二次雅加达非正式会议的三方代表宋双、乔森潘、拉那列2月27日发表声明，重申民主柬埔寨主席西哈努克的五点和平建议是解决柬问题的基础。
    声明强调，民柬三方坚持越南必须按明确时间表、在国际监督下全部撤军；柬埔寨国内实现民族和解；成立以西哈努克为首的四方临时政府。
    声明重申，越南撤军后，柬埔寨需要两个国际监督机构，一是联合国监督委员会——负责监督越南撤军和解除四方多余武装力量等；二是联合国维持和平部队——负责监督不准任何一方单独掌权，防止发生内战，以及防止越南再次入侵柬埔寨。
    新华社曼谷2月28日电　泰国外长西提·沙卫西拉今晚同来访的越南外长阮基石就柬埔寨问题举行了会谈。
    阮基石是在结束对马来西亚4天访问后于今天下午到达曼谷，将对泰国进行3天访问。
    西提在会谈后对新闻界说，双方讨论了如何在第二次雅加达会议后，使政治解决柬埔寨问题尽快取得成果。
    阮基石对新闻界发表讲话时仍然坚持只有柬埔寨各方之间的问题得到解决后，越南才能于今年9月从柬埔寨全部撤军。
    他声称，柬埔寨问题的“国际方面实际上已经得到解决”，只剩“国内方面”需要解决。此间外交官指出，在12万越南军队仍然驻在柬埔寨的情况下，阮基石的讲话是毫无根据的。
    阮基石还坚持越南拒绝联合国在寻求柬埔寨问题政治解决中发挥作用的立场，并且指责联合国在柬埔寨问题上有“偏向”。
