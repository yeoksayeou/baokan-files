The central French province of Puy-de-Dôme has a small town named Guillaume. Starting this month, France is piloting elementary school foreign language education here, with the government allocating 30 million francs for this initiative this year. Once the pilot program in Guillaume City gains experience, foreign language teaching will be implemented nationwide in elementary schools. Education Minister Lionel Jospin stated that elementary school foreign language education is meant to prepare students culturally and psychologically for future language learning. Therefore, it should emphasize entertainment and oral communication, avoiding additional burdens on students and impacting core subjects like language arts and mathematics.

Guillaume City has been implementing English education in all its elementary schools since 1984. This pilot program will add German, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. French President François Mitterrand recently emphasized that the key to winning future economic battles lies in knowledge and technology. As the prospect of a unified European Community market approaches, more and more French people recognize that foreign languages are essential tools for communication. In 1971, France enacted a law requiring large enterprises to allocate one percent of their total employee wages to foreign language training. Currently, in addition to regular school foreign language education, there are 600 specialized foreign language training classes and societies. Language immersion travel activities have become a hot trend in the tourism industry, with nearly 1 million French people participating in such activities annually during their vacations.

　　迎接统一大市场        
    法国掀起外语热
    本报讯  法国中部的多姆山省有个小城叫纪尧姆。从本月起，法国在这里开始试办小学外语教育，政府今年已为这项工作拨款３千万法郎。待纪尧姆市试点取得经验后，外语教学将在全国小学普及。教育部长若斯潘说，小学外语教学是为小学生日后学习外语作些“文化和心理”方面的准备，因此，要突出娱乐性和口语性，不能加重学生负担，影响语文和数学两门基本课程。
    小城纪尧姆市自１９８４年起已经在全市小学普及了英语教育。这次试点工作要增设德语、西班牙语、意大利语和葡萄牙语。法国总统密特朗不久前指出，赢得未来经济战的主要条件是知识和技术。随着欧共体实现统一大市场前景的临近，越来越多的法国人认识到，外语是交往的重要工具。法国１９７１年曾颁布法律规定，各大企业必须把职工工资总额的百分之一用于外语培训。目前，法国除正规学校外语教育外，还有６００所外语专业学习训练班和会社。以实习外语为内容的旅游活动成为旅游界的热门业务，每年利用假期参加这种活动的法国人将近１００万人次。
