Last October, some villagers from the 3rd Team of Tongling Bridge Village in Jinle Township, Nantong County, Jiangsu Province, designated 18 mu of contracted farmland as a "land sale area." To date, some villagers have sold 12 mu of land, and currently, the land is still being transported to other places. Some neighboring teams and villages are also preparing to sell land. The 3rd Team of Tongling Bridge Village sold land without the approval of relevant departments, and there are serious issues in the distribution of the income from the land sales.

　　村民卖土怎能不过问
    去年１０月，我省南通县金乐乡通灵桥村３组的一些村民将１８亩多的责任田划为“卖土区”，至今一些村民已卖土１２亩，眼下这里的土还在不断地运往外地。与这个组邻近的有些村组也有人准备卖土。通灵桥村３组未经有关部门批准擅自卖土，并且在卖土收入的分配中存在着严重的问题。
