The European Community and the European Free Trade Association held a ministerial-level joint conference today. Both sides expressed their readiness to further strengthen cooperation between them and to push it to a higher level.

This joint conference was held following last week's summit meeting of the Free Trade Association in Oslo. A statement issued after the joint conference said that the meeting discussed the proposals made at the Oslo summit for expanding the scope of cooperation between the two groups.

Cooperation between the Community and the Association is currently mainly limited to free trade in industrial goods. The Oslo summit reaffirmed the proposal to expand cooperation between the two groups to the fields of scientific research, technology, transportation, education, environment, and social policies, and expressed a willingness to explore with the Community the establishment of joint decision-making and management bodies.

At a press conference held after the joint conference, the Chairman of the Free Trade Association Council, Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg, said that the Free Trade Association and the Community "have finally taken the right path," and "we are on the same train, and its speed is completely appropriate." The Chairman of the Community Commission, Jacques Delors, reiterated the Community's determination to establish an internal unified market. He said that while the Community is moving towards its goal, it hopes to "share common interests" with other Western European countries.

　　欧共体和欧洲自由贸易联盟举行部长联席会议        
    西欧两大经济组织将加强合作
    新华社布鲁塞尔３月２０日电  欧洲共同体和欧洲自由贸易联盟今天在这里举行部长级联席会议。双方表示准备进一步加强它们之间的合作，将之推向一个更高的水平。
    这次联席会议是继上周在奥斯陆召开的自由贸易联盟首脑会议后举行的。联席会议后发表的声明说，会议讨论了自由贸易联盟在奥斯陆首脑会议上提出的扩大双方合作范围的建议。
    共同体与联盟之间的合作目前基本上局限工业品的自由贸易。奥斯陆首脑会议重申了将两个集团之间的合作扩大到科研、技术、运输、教育、环境及社会政策等领域的主张，并表示愿与共同体一道探讨建立共同的决策和管理机构。
    在联席会议后举行的记者招待会上，自由贸易联盟理事会主席、挪威外交大臣托瓦尔·斯托尔滕贝格则表示，自由贸易联盟和共同体“终于走上了正确的道路”，“我们坐在同一列火车上，而其运行速度是完全适当的”。共同体委员会主席雅克·德洛尔重申了共同体建立内部统一大市场的决心。他说，共同体在走向其目标的同时，希望与西欧其他国家“分享共同利益”。
