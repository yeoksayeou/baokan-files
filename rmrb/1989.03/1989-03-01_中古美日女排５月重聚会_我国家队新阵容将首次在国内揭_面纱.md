The Chinese women's volleyball team, which recently underwent a major overhaul of both coaches and players, will make its first domestic public appearance at the 1989 Four-Nation Women's Volleyball Invitational Tournament in May. They will compete against teams from Cuba, Japan, and the United States in a two-round competition to test their mettle. The Chinese team's performance at the Seoul Olympics sparked various discussions both domestically and internationally. However, with a series of major domestic and international competitions on the horizon, there is no time for the Chinese volleyball community to sit down and thoroughly discuss the issues. The facts will speak for themselves. The revival and restoration of the Chinese women's volleyball team's image must rely on their own efforts, using sweat to regain past glory. The newly formed Chinese women's volleyball team is facing this challenge under such a severe situation.

The Four-Nation Women's Volleyball Invitational Tournament has been held annually since 1985 and has become a high-level traditional international competition held in China. This year's tournament will follow the usual format of two rounds. The first round will take place from May 20 to 24 in Chengdu, and the second round will be held from May 25 to 29 in Beijing. The invited teams, except for the Soviet Union team which cannot participate due to unforeseen circumstances, are all top-tier teams in the current world of women's volleyball.

According to officials from the Chinese Volleyball Association, the newly formed Chinese women's volleyball team is currently undergoing an intensive four-month winter training session in Beijing. After the training, they will visit Switzerland for a series of matches in April before returning to China to participate in the Four-Nation Women's Volleyball Invitational Tournament.

　　中古美日女排５月重聚会
    我国家队新阵容将首次在国内揭“面纱”
    本报北京２月２８日讯  记者吴骅报道：前不久刚刚完成了教练员和运动员大换班的中国女排，将在今年５月举行的１９８９年四国女排邀请赛上首次在国内公开露面，并同古巴、日本、美国三支女排一起进行两轮较量，以试锋芒。汉城奥运会上，中国女排的失利引起了国内外各方面的种种议论。然而，面对接踵而来的国内外重大赛事，却容不得我排球界人士坐下来认真研讨问题。事实是最好的回答，中国女排的重新崛起和形象的恢复必须依靠自己的努力，用汗水去赢得昔日的光荣。新组建的中国女排正是在这样一种严峻的形势下迎接这次比赛的。
    四国女排邀请赛自１９８５年以来已举办过四届。目前，它已成为在我国举行的一项国际性的高水平的传统比赛。今年的四国女排邀请赛仍按照惯例进行两轮比赛，第一轮比赛于５月２０日至２４日在成都举行，第二轮比赛于５月２５日至２９日在北京举行。应邀参赛的队中除苏联队因故不能来外，其余三队均是当今世界女排强队中的佼佼者。
    据中国排协有关人士透露，新组建的中国女排目前正在北京进行为期四个月的紧张冬训。冬训结束后，她们将于４月赴瑞士进行访问比赛，然后回国参加四国女排邀请赛。
