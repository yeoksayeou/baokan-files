    Important economic indicators from various regions for the first two months of this year show that investment growth has slowed, bank loans have decreased, wages have risen rapidly, and economic efficiency is poor.

    According to statistics released today by the State Statistical Bureau, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China, in the first two months of this year, the pace of national investment development has started to decline, bank loans have decreased, but wages have grown rapidly, and industrial economic efficiency is poor.

    Investment scale has been controlled, and growth rate has started to decline. In the first two months, the investment completion amount for state-owned units was 7.9 billion yuan, a decrease of 300 million yuan compared to the same period last year, a reduction of 3.8%. Out of 28 regions, 19 saw a decline in investment growth compared to the same period last year, while 8 regions, including Jilin and Guangdong, saw an increase. The most prominent issue with investment is the continued increase in local projects. In the first two months, state-owned units completed 4.4 billion yuan in local project investments, an increase of 500 million yuan compared to the same period last year, a growth of 12.7%.

    Bank loan balances have generally decreased. As of the end of February, the total loan balance of all banks nationwide was 104.5 billion yuan, a decrease of 9.69 billion yuan compared to the end of last year, a reduction of 8.5%. Out of 30 regions, only Tibet and Qinghai saw a slight increase.

    The growth rate of workers' wages is relatively high. In the first two months, the cumulative total wage amount for all workers nationwide was 38.4 billion yuan, an increase of 7.8 billion yuan compared to the same period last year, a growth of 25.3%. The growth rate in Guangdong, Hainan, Tianjin, Henan, Shandong, and Fujian is higher than the national average.

    Labor productivity has seen a slight increase. In the first two months, the labor productivity of all employees in state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises was 2,780 yuan, an increase of 0.6% compared to the same period last year. Regionally, 10 regions, including Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, saw a decline; 16 regions, including Guangdong, Gansu, and Shaanxi, saw an increase.

    The industrial sales tax rate is lower than last year. In the first two months, the sales tax rate for state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises was 17.46%, a decrease of 2.1 percentage points compared to the same period last year. Out of 29 regions (Tibet was not included in the statistics), 7 regions, including Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Hainan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi, were higher than the national average, and 12 regions saw an improvement in their sales tax rate compared to the same period last year.

    The increase in the cost of industrial products is significant. In the first two months, the comparable product cost for state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises increased by 12.2%, an increase of 7.4 percentage points compared to the same period last year.
