Hebei Encourages Planting of "Patriotic Prosperity" Cotton

    The Hebei provincial government decided yesterday to encourage farmers to plant and cultivate "Patriotic Prosperity" cotton.

    Hebei is a major cotton-producing province in China. After a significant increase in cotton production in 1984, there was a problem with selling the cotton. Due to changes in cotton production policies and the sharp rise in prices of agricultural production materials, cotton production has declined.

    To ensure the completion of the province's 13 million mu cotton planting task, the provincial government has decided to implement a system where the cotton production in producing areas is overseen by officials at the provincial, municipal, county, and township levels. Each level is responsible for ensuring the cotton planting area and implementing measures to increase production. If any issues arise in a particular region, department, or link, the primary responsible person will be held accountable.

　　河北鼓励种“爱国发家”棉
    本报石家庄３月９日电  记者陈国琦报道：河北省政府昨天作出决定，鼓励农民种足种好“爱国发家”棉。
    河北是全国棉花主产省份。１９８４年棉花大增产后，出现了卖棉难。由于改变了棉花生产政策，加上农用生产资料涨价过猛，致使棉花生产出现了滑坡。
    为保证全省１３００万亩棉花种植任务的完成，省政府决定：对产棉区的棉花生产实行专员、市长、县长、乡长负责制，逐级落实棉田面积和增产措施。哪个地区、部门、环节出问题，由其主要负责人承担责任。
