Women's patriotic savings are popular.

The People's Daily, Tianjin, March 6 - On March 4, the first savings office in Tianjin, jointly operated by the Women's Federation and the Industrial and Commercial Bank, was opened in the Hedong District. Within just half an hour, it collected 3.5 million yuan, exceeding the daily savings amount of a typical savings office by more than 10 times.

The "Tianjin Women's Patriotic Savings with Rewards" activity, organized by the Tianjin Women's Federation and other units, will reach its peak during the "March 8" Women's Day. More than 70 large and small meetings and commemorative activities organized by the women's federation will all revolve around this theme.
