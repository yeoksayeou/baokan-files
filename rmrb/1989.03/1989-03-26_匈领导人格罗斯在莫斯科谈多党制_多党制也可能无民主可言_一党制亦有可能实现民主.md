Hungarian Leader Gross Discusses Multi-Party System in Moscow
Multi-Party System May Lack Democracy
One-Party System Can Achieve Democracy

New China News Agency, Moscow, March 24 – The General Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Gross, stated today at a press conference here that the political structure each country chooses is the business of its own people. Contemporary examples show that democracy may not exist within a multi-party system, and democracy can be realized within a one-party system.

Gross arrived in the Soviet Union on March 23 at the invitation of the Soviet Union for a working visit. Today, he held a three-hour discussion with the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Gorbachev.

In response to foreign journalists' questions about the multi-party system at the press conference, he said that each country's situation is different. The Soviet Union's approach is primarily related to the Soviet people and Soviet leadership. Socialist democracy can also be thoroughly realized within a one-party system. Hungary, on the other hand, wants to continue the cause of socialist construction within the framework of a multi-party system, and the Hungarian leadership wants to better represent the interests of the people.

He also confirmed that he discussed the 1956 Hungarian incident with Gorbachev. He referred to this incident as a "historical tragedy for the Hungarian nation." He pointed out that the initial student uprising later turned into a counter-revolutionary action. Now, 33 years later, it is possible to evaluate the essence of this incident more calmly. He believes that the international conditions at that time played an important role. He revealed that on some important issues regarding this incident, the views of the Hungarian and Soviet sides are consistent; both sides also agreed to continue to jointly study and analyze the various causes and events that influenced the situation at that time based on some reliable documents.

　　匈领导人格罗斯在莫斯科谈多党制        
    多党制也可能无民主可言        
    一党制亦有可能实现民主
    新华社莫斯科３月２４日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党总书记格罗斯今天在此间举行的记者招待会上表示，每个国家选择什么样的政治结构，是各国人民自己的事。当代世界有例子证明，在多党制范畴内也可能没有民主可言，而在一党制范围内民主可能实现。
    格罗斯是应邀于２３日抵苏进行工作访问的，今天他同苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫进行了长达３小时的会谈。
    他在记者招待会上回答外国记者有关多党制的提问时说，各国国情不同，苏联的做法首先与苏联人民和苏联领导有关，社会主义民主也可能在一党制范围内得到彻底实现。而匈牙利则想在多党制范畴内将社会主义建设事业继续下去，匈牙利领导想更充分地体现人民的利益。
    他还证实，他同戈尔巴乔夫讨论了１９５６年匈牙利事件。他把这一事件称作是“匈牙利民族的历史悲剧”。他指出，起初的大学生起义后来变成了反革命行动，现在，即３３年过后，已能冷静得多地来评价这一事件的本质。他认为，当时存在的国际条件起了重要的作用。他透露，在对这一事件的一些重要问题的评价上，匈苏双方的看法是一致的；双方还商定，今后要依据一些确凿可信的文件，继续共同研究和分析当时对事态产生影响的各种原因和事件。
