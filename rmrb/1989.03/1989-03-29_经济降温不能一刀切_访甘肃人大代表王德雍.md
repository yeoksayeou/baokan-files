	Economic Cooling Should Not Be a One-Size-Fits-All Approach
	— An Interview with Gansu People's Congress Representative Wang Deyong
	By Meng Xiaoyun, People's Daily Reporter

	“Since the state investment policy has further tilted towards the east, the economic development in the eastern region has been boosted significantly.” Wang Deyong, a representative from the western region to the People's Congress, deeply lamented the imbalance in development speed between the east and the west.

	He analyzed that the eastern region lacks raw materials and is mainly focused on processing industries. Its development relies on the support of the raw material industries in the west. The tilted policy and the principle of benefit have caused the processing industry, which was already developing faster than the raw material industry, to grow at an ultra-high speed. This has led to a severe lag in the raw material industry in the west, exacerbating the supply-demand contradiction and causing a nationwide “raw material war.”

	He believes that domestically, the policy of low prices for non-ferrous metal raw materials has long been in place, deviating far from the actual value of these non-ferrous metals. The essence of this low-price policy is to transfer the benefits of raw material production enterprises to deep-processing enterprises through the means of a planned economy. Most of the raw materials produced in the west are sold to eastern processing enterprises at planned low prices, while the purchased processing materials and production equipment are mostly high-priced. This results in a situation where the western raw material enterprises suffer losses on both ends, transferring tens of billions of yuan in benefits to eastern processing enterprises each year. This artificially weakens the strength and interests of raw material enterprises, affecting the development of the raw material industry.

	Due to the low-price policy for non-ferrous raw materials, the processing industry has been able to obtain excessive profits, leading to uncontrolled and blind expansion of the processing industry, exacerbating the supply-demand contradiction.

	Wang Deyong suggested that in the current rectification and adjustment, to cool down the overheated economy, a one-size-fits-all approach should not be taken. Instead, support should be given to the resource industries in the west to gradually make the economic structures of the east and west more reasonable.

	He also suggested that the state should adjust the prices of non-ferrous metal raw materials as soon as possible. For the prices of non-ferrous metal raw materials, the first step is to continue the dual-track system, releasing the prices of non-planned products to follow market trends; the second step is to abolish the dual-track system, release the prices of non-ferrous metals, and align them with international prices.

　　经济降温不能一刀切        
    ——访甘肃人大代表王德雍
    本报记者  孟晓云
    “国家投资政策进一步向东倾斜后，东部地区经济发展如虎添翼。”来自西部的人大代表王德雍深为感叹的是东部与西部的发展速度不平衡。
    他分析，东部地区缺乏原材料，以加工业为主，其发展靠西部原材料产业支撑，倾斜政策和利益原则使本来就比原材料工业发展快的加工业超高速增长，从而使西部原材料工业严重滞后，加剧了供需矛盾，造成了全国性的“原材料大战”。
    他认为，国内对有色金属原材料一直采取低价政策，远远背离了这些有色金属的价值。这种低价政策的实质是通过指令性计划的方式把原材料生产厂家的效益转移给了深度加工企业。西部生产的原材料绝大部分按计划价格低价调给东部加工企业，而买进的加工材料和生产设备却大多是高价。这样两头吃亏的结果，使西部原材料企业每年转移到东部加工企业的效益数以几十亿计，人为地削弱了原材料企业的实力和利益，影响了原材料工业的发展。
    由于对有色原材料价格实行低价政策，使加工工业得以获得超额利润，导致了加工工业的发展失控、盲目膨胀，加剧了供需矛盾。
    王德雍建议，在当前治理整顿中，要使过热的经济降温，不能搞一刀切，而要对西部资源工业给予扶持，使东西部的经济结构逐步趋于合理。
    他还建议国家尽早调整有色金属原材料的价格。对有色金属原材料的价格，第一步，继续实行双轨制，计划外产品价格放开，随行就市；第二步，取消双轨制，放开有色金属价格，向国际价格靠拢。
