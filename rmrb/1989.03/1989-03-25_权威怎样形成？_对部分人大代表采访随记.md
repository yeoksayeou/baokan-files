Title: How is Authority Formed?

The severity of the economic situation and the disorder in economic order have made people yearn for authority from the bottom of their hearts. This is a deep impression gained by the reporter during interviews with several deputies to the National People's Congress over the past few days.

	“I fully agree with the goals of rectification and austerity measures proposed by Premier Li Peng,” said Xu Yinglian, a deputy from Guizhou. “However, if there is no authoritative supervisory body and no strong enforcement measures, I am afraid it will be difficult to achieve.”

The central government has long issued warnings about the possibility of economic overheating and has taken a series of measures, such as reducing the scale of construction projects, controlling the issuance of credit, and limiting group consumption, among others. What have been the results of these measures?

	“If it was suppressed, it was suppressed; if it was not suppressed, no one was held accountable. The honest people suffered a loss!”

	“Those who make a lot of noise get attention from above; those who work hard are assumed to have no difficulties. It's true that the crying children get more milk.”

The inability to enforce orders and prohibitions has led to a sense of unfairness in policy enforcement.

A deputy from Tianjin bluntly stated: “The lack of authority in policies is precisely the result of those who formulate and control the policies!”

Some deputies suggested that, in the current rectification and austerity measures, the central government must take strict measures to suppress the expansion of reproduction and ensure that simple reproduction can be maintained. However, at the same time, the reporter also heard another voice: “Overheating is a fact, but can we not distinguish between the fat and the thin, between the severity of the conditions, and simply give everyone two fever-reducing pills?”

The emergence of a multi-interest structure has made the problem even more complex. On the one hand, conflicts arise, and people hope that the higher authorities will coordinate and resolve them; on the other hand, when the higher authorities coordinate and resolve them, they try to protect their own interests as much as possible. “In the 1960s, during the adjustment period, the Party Central Committee issued an order, and tens of thousands of people returned from the cities to the countryside. Can this be done now?”

There is a hope for a decisive reduction in inflation, but there is also a concern that a one-size-fits-all approach will exacerbate the imbalance in the industrial structure and weaken the momentum for economic development; there is a hope for strengthened administrative management, but there is also a concern that it will cut off the economic links established by the development of commodity economy... “The problems we encounter are problems of development,” the deputies gradually realized the rich meaning of this sentence.

Nie Biqi, a deputy from Tianjin, proposed that major decisions should be made with greater scientific and democratic input. If something cannot be done, do not say it; if it is said, it must be done. Wang Genyuan, a deputy from Shandong, said: “Reform cannot rely solely on incentive mechanisms; it must also establish corresponding restraint mechanisms. Through deepening the reform, every person should be made to realize that the country's difficulties are their own difficulties.”

　　权威怎样形成？        
    ——对部分人大代表采访随记
    本报记者  莫新元
    经济形势的严峻，经济秩序的混乱，使人们从心底呼唤着权威。这是记者几天来采访人大代表时所获得的一个深切感受。
    “李鹏总理报告中提出的治理整顿目标，我非常赞成，”贵州代表徐英莲说，“但是，如果没有有权威的监督机构，没有强有力的执行手段，我担心难以实现。”
    中央早就发出了可能出现经济过热的警告，也采取了一系列措施，如压缩基建规模、控制信贷发放、限制集团消费，等等。执行结果怎样呢？
    “压了的就压了，没压的也没见追究，第二年反倒又以此为基数。老实人吃了亏！”
    “吵得厉害的，上面给照顾；埋头苦干的，却以为你没困难。真是会叫唤的孩子多吃奶。”
    有令不行，有禁不止，已引起了执行政策的不公平感。
    一位天津代表干脆说：“政策缺乏权威性，正是制定、掌握政策的人造成的！”
    有代表主张，当前治理整顿，中央必须采取严厉措施，压掉扩大再生产部分，确保简单再生产得以维持。可是与此同时，记者也听到了另一种声音：“发热是实情，但总不能不分胖瘦，不分病情轻重，一律吃两片退烧药吧？”
    利益多元化格局的出现，使问题更加复杂化。一方面，发生了矛盾，希望上面来协调解决；另一方面，上面来协调解决时，又想尽可能多地保护自己的利益。“６０年代调整时期，党中央一声令下，多少万人从城市回到农村。现在能做得到吗？”
    希望断然压缩膨胀，又担心一刀切的做法会加剧产业结构的失衡，会削弱经济发展的后劲；希望强化行政管理，又担心会切断发展商品经济建立起的经济联系……“我们遇到的问题，是发展中的问题”，代表们逐步认识到这句话有着多么丰富的含义。
    天津代表聂壁初提出，进行重大决策，要加强科学化和民主化。做不到的，就别说；说了，就要做到。山东代表王根源说：“改革不能光有激励机制，还要建立相应的约束机制。要通过深化改革，使每个人能够认识到，国家的困难，就是自己的困难。”
