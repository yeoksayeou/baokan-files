On March 1, the resplendent Yonghe Temple in Beijing once again echoed with the deep tones of the ceremonial bell and the melodious chanting of scriptures. The annual "Great Wish Prayer Assembly" had begun.

Outside the immaculate Buddhist hall, a large crowd of curious Hong Kong and Macau pilgrims and devout mainland believers stood in anticipation. Inside the hall, wisps of incense smoke rose from the censers. More than 40 lamas sat cross-legged, reciting the "Ganden Lhagyama" and six other Buddhist scriptures in a rhythmic and resonant manner. This year, to commemorate the passing of the Panchen Lama, the lamas specially added a scripture to pray for the early reincarnation of the Lama's soul.

The Great Wish Prayer Assembly at Yonghe Temple, which had been suspended for 30 years, was resumed last year. This year marks the second time it has been held. An organizer of the assembly said that the event's timely resumption reflects the government's respect for religious believers and symbolizes the unity between Han and Tibetan religious communities.

On March 7, the "Sending Away Evil Spirits" ceremony began. The lamas made a life-sized figure out of dough, and with drums and gongs, escorted it out of the temple. This dough figure represents evil spirits and disasters. By sending it away, the lamas pray for national prosperity, people's well-being, and bountiful harvests.

The "Buzha" dance is one of the most culturally distinctive religious activities during the assembly. Two young lamas, dressed as a deer and the Earth Store Bodhisattva, performed various dance movements in front of the spectators. They leaped, rolled, and chased each other in circles, expressing joy in bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new. In just ten minutes, the two lamas performed over a hundred different movements. No wonder, when they removed their heavy headdresses, steam rose from their heads.

On the eve of the assembly's conclusion, the lamas blew horns and beat drums, circling the temple once to bring the Maitreya Buddha back to the hall. The visitors and pilgrims dispersed, and Yonghe Temple returned to its usual tranquility.

　　雍和宫里的祝福
    本报记者  袁建达
    ３月１日，金碧辉煌的北京雍和宫再一次响起雄浑的法号和悠扬的念经声。一年一度的“大愿祈祷法会”拉开了帷幕。
    洁净如洗的佛殿外，站着一大群好奇的港澳香客和虔诚的内地信徒。佛殿内，缕缕青烟从香炉中升起。４０多位喇嘛盘腿而坐，抑扬顿挫地念着《宗喀巴结缘经》等７部佛家经典。今年为了悼念班禅大师圆寂，喇嘛们特意增念了一部祈求大师灵童早日转世的佛经。
    雍和宫大愿祈祷法会是中断了３０年后，于去年开始恢复的，今年是第二次。法会一位组织者说，法会如期举行，体现了政府对宗教徒的尊重，也是汉族和藏族信教群众团结的象征。
    ３月７日，“送祟”活动开始。喇嘛们用面做成一尺半高的假人，敲锣打鼓地把它送出宫外。这个面人就是“祟”，它象征着妖魔鬼怪和灾难。喇嘛们送走它，以祈祷国泰民安、风调雨顺。
    跳“布扎”是法会期间最富于民族特色的宗教活动。两位年轻的喇嘛分别化装成鹿和地藏主，在众人的围观下，做出种种舞蹈动作。他们或翻滚跳跃，或转圈追逐，表达辞旧迎新的喜悦。十来分钟的跳“布扎”，动作竟有百十个之多。难怪两位喇嘛摘下沉重的帽子时，头上蒸腾着缕缕热气。
    法会结束前夕，喇嘛们吹号打锣，绕寺一周，把弥勒佛接回佛殿。游人香客纷纷离去，雍和宫又恢复了往日的平静。
