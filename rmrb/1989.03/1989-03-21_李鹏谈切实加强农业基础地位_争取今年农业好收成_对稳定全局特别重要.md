Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 20th.

Li Peng, the Premier, proposed at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress that the foundational role of agriculture in the national economy must be strengthened, and that efforts should be made to achieve a good harvest this year, especially for grain, cotton, and oil crops. It is also important to maintain stable development for other crops and the forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries sectors. This is particularly crucial for curbing price increases and stabilizing the overall economy. He said that developing agriculture requires, first, the implementation of stable rural policies and deepening reforms; second, the promotion and development of advanced agricultural science and technology; and third, increasing agricultural investments to enhance the momentum for agricultural development.

Li Peng said that to motivate farmers to increase grain and cotton production, the State Council has decided to raise the purchase price of contracted grain by an average of 18% starting April 1st. Grain not covered by contracts will be traded in the market with prices determined by supply and demand. At the same time, cotton prices will be appropriately increased when new cotton comes to market.

He said that the State Council has decided that this year's central fiscal investment in agriculture, including forestry and water conservancy, will not only not be reduced but will also be increased. Local governments and other sectors should allocate more financial resources to increase agricultural investments. To ensure stable increases in agricultural investments, starting this year, funds will be raised from various sources to establish an agricultural development fund. Meanwhile, the Agricultural Bank and credit cooperatives plan to increase agricultural loans by 17.2 billion yuan this year, a 63% increase from last year. They will also adjust the structure of the existing nearly 80 billion yuan in agricultural loans to support the construction of national and local commercial grain, cotton, and sugar production bases, support the development of agricultural resources and the construction of agricultural infrastructure, and support the implementation of the "vegetable basket" project.

Li Peng said that the household contract responsibility system should be maintained and continuously improved. It is advocated to establish a multi-level and multi-form rural socialized production service system, and to gradually integrate and coordinate these systems to promote the development of the rural commodity economy. In areas with the necessary conditions, with the voluntary participation of the people, it is possible to gradually implement appropriate scale management to further improve agricultural labor productivity. Development-oriented agriculture should be managed on a scale as much as possible.

　　李鹏谈切实加强农业基础地位        
    争取今年农业好收成     
    对稳定全局特别重要
    新华社北京三月二十日电  李鹏总理在七届全国人大二次会议上提出，切实加强农业在国民经济中的基础地位，争取今年农业特别是粮食棉花油料生产有个好收成，并且保持其他作物和林牧渔业稳定发展，对于抑制物价上涨、稳定经济全局具有特别重要的意义。他说，发展农业，一要靠执行稳定的农村政策和深化改革，二要靠推广和发展先进的农业科学技术，三要靠增加农业投入，增强农业发展后劲。
    李鹏说，为了调动农民增产粮食和棉花的积极性，国务院决定从今年四月一日起，将合同定购粮食的收购价格平均提高百分之十八，合同定购以外的粮食实行市场交易，价格随行就市。同时，在新棉上市时适当提高棉花收购价格。
    他说，国务院决定，今年中央财政对农业包括林业、水利的投入不仅不减少，还要有所增加。地方政府和其它方面要把更多的财力用于增加农业投入。为了稳定增加农业投入，从今年开始将从多种渠道筹集和建立农业发展基金。与此同时，农业银行、信用社计划今年增加农业贷款一百七十二亿元，比上年农业贷款增加百分之六十三，同时调整原有近八百亿元农业贷款的结构，支持国家和地方的商品粮、棉、糖等生产基地建设，支持农业资源开发和农业基础设施的配套建设，支持搞好“菜篮子”工程：
    李鹏说，以家庭经济为主的联产承包责任制，应当保持稳定并不断完善。提倡建立多层次、多形式的农村社会化的生产服务体系，并使之逐步相互配套，促进农村商品经济的发展。在少数确实具备条件的地方，在群众自愿的前提下，可以有步骤地实行适度规模经营，以进一步提高农业劳动生产率。开发性农业要尽可能实行规模经营。
