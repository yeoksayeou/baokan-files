Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 23rd.

Deng Xiaoping, during his meeting with Museveni, discussed the ten years of reform, stating that the biggest mistake was the insufficient development of education.

Deng Xiaoping said, "In the past ten years, our biggest mistake was the insufficient development of education. Most importantly, in the process of developing and improving the living standards of the people, we did not tell the people and the Communist Party members to maintain the tradition of hard work and self-reliance. After careful consideration, we believe that this problem is bigger than issues like inflation. Only after several years of hard work will there be better and sustained development. As long as people's minds are united, governance will not be difficult."

Deng Xiaoping told Museveni, "This time, I did not attend the National People's Congress; I took leave mainly to take care of my health. More importantly, I have completely retired from the stage, allowing others to work. This has been my goal for many years."

Chairman Deng said, "Because our new leadership team was elected at the 13th Party Congress, some of us old people have retired from the Politburo and its Standing Committee, and I am one of them. Because there is a new political landscape, we should not make the new leaders feel that there is always a layer of power above them, which is not good. In this regard, we old people must be self-aware."

Chairman Deng said, "In the past ten years, we have had commendable development. China's economy and living standards can be said to have reached a new level. In the process of development, new mistakes have also emerged, but the main achievements are still there. Because doubling our output in ten years is not easy, this is the result of adhering to the Four Modernizations and the policy of reform and opening up. The line, principles, and policies are correct. We have not made big mistakes, and small mistakes are inevitable because we lack experience, and this will also be difficult to avoid in the future. Deng Xiaping said, Li Peng, the Premier, mentioned mistakes in his government work report to the National People's Congress. Foreign countries commented that it was self-criticism. For these mistakes, we old comrades also have a share. He said, one experience is that in times of smooth development, one must see new problems, development must be moderate, and an overheated economy easily leads to problems. We will spend two or three years, at most four years, to overcome the difficulties."

Chairman Deng continued, "All policies should be based on reality and will not lead to big mistakes. Once mistakes are discovered, they should not be concealed or avoided. Once corrected, it will create good conditions for continued development. We are confident in overcoming difficulties."

When discussing the international situation, President Museveni said that the current easing of the international situation is mainly due to the struggles and mutual support of the peoples of the world.

Deng Xiaoping said, "Opposing hegemony is not easy. Although the Chinese people have stood up, others still want to bully us. Now, some countries still want to interfere in our internal affairs through their parliaments."

In the morning of March 23rd, Deng Xiaoping, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, met with Ugandan President Museveni.

    最大失误教育发展不够
    十年中最大的失误是在教育方面发展不够。最重要的是在发展和提高人民生活水平的情况下，没有告诉人民和共产党员要保持艰苦奋斗的传统。这个问题比通货膨胀等问题更大
    一切政策从实际出发就不会犯大错误，发现了错误不掩饰，不回避，一旦纠正过来，就会为继续发展创造很好的条件
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    本报北京３月２３日讯　记者孙毅报道：“我们在１０年中最大的失误是在教育方面发展不够。最重要的是在发展和提高人民生活水平的情况下，没有告诉人民和共产党员要保持艰苦奋斗的传统。我们经过冷静的考虑，认为这个问题比通货膨胀等问题更大。只有经过若干年的艰苦奋斗，才会有较好的发展、持续的发展。只要人们思想统一了，治理也不难”。这是中央军委主席邓小平今天上午在人民大会堂会见应邀来访的乌干达共和国总统约韦里·卡古塔·穆塞韦尼时讲这番话的。
    邓小平对穆塞韦尼总统说，这次人大我没有参加，我请假了，主要是保养身体。更重要的，自己完全从舞台上退下来，让别人工作，这是我多年来的目标。
    邓主席说，因为我们新的领导班子在党的十三大选出来了，我们一些老人退出了政治局和政治局常委，我算一个。因为有一个新的政治格局了，就不要使新的领导人感觉到头上总有那么一层盖住他们的力量，这个不好。在这一方面我们这些老人要自觉。
    邓小平主席说，在过去的１０年中，我们有可喜的发展，中国的经济、生活水平可以说上了一个台阶。发展中也出现了新的失误，但主要的还是我们的成就，因为在１０年中翻了一番是不容易的，这是坚持四化路线、坚持改革开放政策带来的，路线、方针、政策是正确的。我们大错误没犯、小错误没断，因为我们没有经验，今后这也难以避免。邓小平说，李鹏总理在全国人大作的政府工作报告中谈到失误，外国议论说是作了自我批评，对这些失误，我们老同志也有份。他说，一条经验就是在发展顺利的时候，要看到新的问题，发展要适度，经济过热就容易出毛病。我们花两、三年，最多四年就可以度过困难。
    邓主席接着说，一切政策要从实际出发就不会犯大错误，发现了错误不掩饰、不回避，一旦纠正过来，就会为继续发展创造很好的条件。我们是有信心克服困难的。
    在谈到世界局势时，穆塞韦尼总统说，目前世界局势出现的缓和，主要归功于世界人民的斗争和相互支持。
    邓小平说，反对霸权主义不容易，尽管中国人民已经站起来了，但是人家还要欺负我们，现在有些国家还要通过议会干涉我们的内政。
