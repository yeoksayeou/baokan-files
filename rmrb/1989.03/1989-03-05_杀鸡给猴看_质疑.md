Title: Questioning the Practice of "Killing a Chicken to Scare the Monkeys"

The phrase "killing a chicken to scare the monkeys" is often used as a means of deterrence and is repeatedly employed by some people. However, I have a few doubts about it.

My first doubt: What if the wrong "chicken" is killed? If the "chicken" has committed a capital offense, it should be executed without question. However, if it should not be killed, then it must not be "sentenced to death." If the "chicken" is killed just to "scare the monkeys," isn't that a case of wrongfully killing an "innocent" one?

My second doubt: Why must the "monkeys" be shown the killing of the "chicken"? If the "chicken" deserves to be killed, then just "execute the sentence." Why is it necessary for the "monkeys" to witness it? The "monkeys" might be somewhat fearful the first time they see the "chicken" being killed, and their illegal behavior might be somewhat restrained. However, if this happens repeatedly, the "monkeys" will not only become fearless but might even find it quite interesting. In this case, killing the "chicken" is not so much about "scaring the monkeys" as it is about providing entertainment for the "monkeys."

My third doubt: Why not "kill a monkey to scare the monkeys"? If one wants to "warn" those monkeys that are still causing trouble but do not yet deserve to be killed, why not kill a deserving "monkey" to set an example for them? The killing of a fellow monkey might have a greater deterrent effect on them.

Everyone knows that if the "monkeys" start causing trouble, their harm will far exceed that of the "chickens." However, people now find it acceptable to kill "chickens," but killing "monkeys" is quite difficult. Why is this the case? Apart from other reasons, the superstition of using "killing a chicken" as a warning might also be a factor. Therefore, "killing a chicken to scare the monkeys" is neither reasonable nor legal, and it may not even be effective. A more effective approach might be to treat the crimes of "monkeys" and "chickens" equally. Whoever commits a crime should be punished accordingly, regardless of whether they are a monkey or a chicken. Those who deserve to be killed should be executed without mercy; those who do not deserve to be killed should not be killed. Killing chickens for the sake of monkeys or killing monkeys for the sake of chickens is not acceptable.

### “杀鸡给猴看”质疑

　　“杀鸡给猴看”质疑
    齐殿斌
    “杀鸡给猴看”常被作为警世的手段，被某些人反复运用。然而我却有几分疑惑。
    疑惑之一：会不会错杀了“鸡”？若“鸡”犯了死罪，该杀毫无疑问，“立即执行”。但是，不该杀则坚决不能“开刀问斩”。如果仅仅为了“警猴”就杀了不该杀的“鸡”，岂不是错杀“无辜”吗？
    疑惑之二：杀“鸡”为什么定要给“猴”看？既然是该杀的“鸡”，那你“动刀”就是了，为什么非要让“猴”来看不可呢？那“猴”第一次看杀“鸡”，也许还能生出几分畏惧，“不法行为”也许还会有几分收敛。如果一而再，再而三，让“猴”看惯了，它非但不怕，反而会觉得挺有意思。这样，杀“鸡”与其说“警猴”，倒不如说是给“猴们”增加了几分乐趣。
    疑惑之三：为什么不可以“杀猴给猴看”？如果想“警告”那些尚在作恶，但又不够杀的“猴”，为什么不可以杀一个该杀的“猴”给它们看看呢？同类被杀，对它们也许更有威慑力。
    谁都知道，那“猴们”若是作起孽来，其危害远在“鸡辈”之上。然而，如今人们觉得杀“鸡”尚可，杀“猴”却颇难。何以如此？其他原因之外，迷信“杀鸡”示警，恐怕也是一个原因。所以，“杀鸡给猴看”既不合情理，不合法规，也未必有效。比较有效的，恐怕是“猴们”犯法与“鸡们”犯法同罪，谁的罪就是谁的罪，不论鸡猴。依法该杀的，一个不留；依法不该杀的，一个不杀。为了猴杀鸡，为了鸡杀猴，皆不可取。
