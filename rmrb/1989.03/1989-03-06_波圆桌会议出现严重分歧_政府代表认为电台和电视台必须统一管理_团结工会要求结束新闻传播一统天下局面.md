Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 4th.

Serious disagreements have emerged at the Polish Round Table Conference regarding the sharing of radio and television programs between the government and the Solidarity trade union.

The issue of sharing radio and television programs is a crucial topic in the media working group of the Polish "Round Table Conference."

In his speech, Solidarity representative Kozlowski repeatedly emphasized the need to end the government's monopoly over the management and programming of radio and television. He demanded that the government allow Solidarity representatives to join the state radio and television system to host "independent union" special programs. Government representative Jachac, however, repeatedly rejected this demand, which was described as opening a "window" in the state radio and television committee. He argued that the state radio and television should be "unified and coordinated" by the government and that this important public opinion platform could not be relinquished.

However, he added that this did not mean that there would be only one voice on radio and television in the future. Instead, there would be various voices, and radio and television would organize special programs related to unions, report on union activities, reflect union positions and views, and invite union members to express their opinions.

At the third meeting of the media working group held on March 4, both sides maintained their original positions. The government representative stated that the government was not prepared to change its stance. The Solidarity representative expressed regret and believed that this fundamental disagreement would be "difficult to resolve in the short term."

There are only two weeks left until the Round Table Conference concludes. Polish Interior Minister Kiszczak recently met with former Solidarity leader Walesa, urging representatives to speed up their work to accelerate the conference's progress.

It was announced that the fourth meeting of the media working group will continue to discuss this issue on March 10, and a radio and television issue subcommittee has been established to explore ways and methods to resolve this problem.

　　波圆桌会议出现严重分歧
    政府代表认为电台和电视台必须统一管理
    团结工会要求结束新闻传播一统天下局面
    新华社华沙三月四日电  波兰当局与团结工会在分享电台、电视台节目问题上分歧颇大，难以弥合。
    分享电台、电视台节目问题是波兰“圆桌会议”舆论工具问题分组的一个重要议题。
    团结工会代表科兹沃夫斯基在发言中不断扬言必须结束当局对电台、电视台管理和节目安排上的“一统天下”局面，要求当局允许团结工会代表进入国家电台、电视台工作系统，主持“独立的工会”专题节目。当局代表雅哈奇则不止一次地拒绝这个被称为在国家电台、电视委员会工作中开“窗口”的要求，认为国家电台、电视台工作应由政府“统一管理”和“统筹安排”，表示不能让出这个重要的舆论阵地。
    不过，他补充说，这不意味着今后电台、电视台的声音只有一个，相反将有各种不同的声音，电台、电视台将组织有关工会的专题节目，报道工会工作的动态，反映工会的立场和观点，并邀请工会人士发表意见。
    在三月四日举行的舆论工具分组第三次会议上，双方的观点依然如故。当局代表声明说，当局不准备改变自己的立场。团结工会代表对此表示遗憾并认为，在短期内将“无法消除这一原则性分歧”。
    现在离“圆桌会议”闭幕只有两周了。波兰内务部长基什查克与前团结工会主席瓦文萨日前会晤，呼吁代表们加紧工作，以加速会议进程。
    据宣布，三月十日舆论工具分组第四次会议将继续讨论这个问题，并已成立了电台、电视台问题小组来探讨解决这个问题的途径和方法。
