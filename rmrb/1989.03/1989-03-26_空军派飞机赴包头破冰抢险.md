Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 25th.

Two planes bearing the "August 1st" military insignia flew to a location 30 kilometers southwest of Baotou in Inner Mongolia today. They dropped 32 explosive bombs on a 5-kilometer-long ice dam in a bend of the Yellow River. After the ice dam was blown open and the water flowed away, the river water that was about to flood the embankment receded.

The temperature difference in the Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River is significant. Every year, hundreds of meters of ice blocks move downstream in succession, obstructing the water flow. After receiving the ice jam report, the Beijing Military Region Air Force quickly dispatched a bomber squadron to break the ice and rescue the situation.

　　空军派飞机赴包头破冰抢险
    本报太原３月２５日电  今天，两架标有“八一”军徽的飞机，在内蒙古包头西南３０公里处的黄河转弯处投下３２枚爆破弹。一片长５公里多的冰坝炸开后流走，即将淹没堤岸的河水退了回去。
    黄河在内蒙古段温差较大。每年数百米的冰块鱼贯向下游移动，阻碍了水流。北京军区空军航空兵某师接到凌情后，很快出动一个轰炸机中队破冰抢险。
