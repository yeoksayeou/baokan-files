	Last year's economic overheating in China, compared to the 1985 economic overheating, both occurred on the basis of significant development in productive forces. They were difficulties encountered during development and progress, but each had its own characteristics.

	The previous economic overheating started on the basis of continuous bumper harvests in agriculture; this time, economic overheating developed amidst stagnant grain, cotton, and oil production. Last year's rapid industrial growth was driven not only by excessive demand and competitive speed but also by mechanisms such as enterprise contracting, local fiscal, and foreign trade contracting.

	During the previous economic overheating, fiscal revenue saw an extraordinary increase, with the 1985 budgetary fiscal revenue growing by 24.2% compared to the previous year; this time, due to enterprise contracting, the increased revenue from production and commodity price hikes mostly remained within enterprises and intermediary links, with the state receiving very little. It is estimated that the 1988 fiscal revenue growth was less than 10%, and considering the price factor, it was actually negative growth.

	During the previous economic overheating, the market was relatively stable. Although prices rose by 8.8%, this was mainly due to the state's planned adjustment of agricultural product prices, coupled with subsidies for urban residents, making residents' psychology relatively stable; this time, inflation was evident, with spontaneous and chaotic price increases being prominent. Consumers' psychology of purchasing for preservation was enhanced, and the order in the circulation sector was chaotic. Especially at present, with the coexistence and stalemate of the new and old systems, the state's macro-control capability has weakened.

	Relevant experts believe that the difficulties brought by the 1988 economic overheating are more complex than those of the previous time. It can also be said that the 1988 economic overheating is a continuation and development of the 1985 economic overheating.

　　去年经济过热特点：在粮棉油生产连年徘徊之中形成
    企业承包等使国家实际收入减少
    流通领域混乱宏观调控能力削弱
    本报北京２月２８日讯  记者张国荣报道：国家统计局新闻发言人今天说，１９８８年中国经济过热同１９８５年的经济过热相比，都是在生产力大发展基础上的过热，是发展、前进中的困难，但两次经济过热各有特点。
    上次经济过热是在农业生产连年丰收的基础上起步的；这次经济过热是在粮、棉、油生产连年徘徊的情况下发展的。去年工业高速增长除了过旺的需求和互攀速度外，企业承包，地方财政、外贸包干的机制也起到推动作用。
    上次经济过热，财政实现了超常规的增收，１９８５年预算内财政收入比上年增长２４．２％；这次经济过热，由于企业已承包，增加生产和商品涨价带来的收入大都留在企业和中间环节，国家拿不到多少，预计１９８８年财政收入增长不到１０％，如果考虑到物价因素，实际是负增长。
    上次经济过热，市场比较稳定，物价虽上升８．８％，主要是国家有计划调整农产品价格，同时给城镇居民补贴，居民心理较稳定；这次经济过热，通货膨胀明显，自发涨价、乱涨价现象突出，消费者购物保值心理增强，流通领域秩序混乱。特别是目前在新旧两种体制处在相持、并存的情况下，国家的宏观调控能力减弱。
    有关人士研究认为，１９８８年经济过热带来的困难，存在的问题比上次更复杂，也可以说，１９８８年的经济过热，是１９８５年经济过热的延续和发展。
