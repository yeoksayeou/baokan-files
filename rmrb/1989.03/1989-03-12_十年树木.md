March 12 is an ordinary day, but because it is linked to tree planting, afforestation, and greening the motherland, it has become a day of special significance.

Today, our great motherland welcomes its 11th Arbor Day. Thousands upon thousands of people will plant new trees on this day, adding a touch of beauty to another spring for our motherland.

The saying goes, "Ten years to grow trees." Over the past ten years, the entire Party and the people have worked tirelessly to beautify the rivers and mountains of our motherland, dressing the land in green. They have achieved significant results in afforestation, greening, and tree planting. However, we must also be clear-eyed and see that the national tree-planting campaign has developed unevenly. Currently, the number of people participating in tree planting each year is only about one-third of the statutory number. Some villages and parts of cities and units have yet to launch the national tree-planting campaign. This indicates that the task of mobilizing the entire society to engage in greening is still quite arduous.

Launching the national tree-planting campaign is a resolution passed by the highest authority of our country, the National People's Congress, and is a legally binding task that every able-bodied citizen should honorably fulfill. Considering the past "leftist" lessons, we generally do not advocate for any "movements," but the obligatory tree-planting campaign is still proposed to be carried out as a movement. This is because it involves mobilizing hundreds of millions of people and must be carried out year after year, which in itself demonstrates the resolve of the Chinese people to plant trees, afforest, and green the motherland.

Raising people's awareness of afforestation and obligatory tree planting is not something that can be achieved through a few meetings or mobilization speeches. From the practices of some advanced greening units, it is clear that to deeply promote the national tree-planting campaign, it is necessary to do a good job of ideological mobilization. However, there is another very important aspect: enforcing the law to promote afforestation. Some places have implemented a system of greening targets with responsibilities for leading cadres during their terms, and they strictly assess and reward or punish accordingly. For units and individuals who fail to fulfill their obligations without reason, economic penalties are set according to the economic development level of each place. These experiences are worth summarizing and promoting.

Peasants are the main force in our country's afforestation and greening efforts. Without the participation of the vast majority of peasants, it is impossible to green the land. Currently, many peasants still have doubts about tree planting and afforestation because past policies have changed frequently, leading to the situation where trees are planted every year but no forests are seen, resulting in their lack of confidence in the success of afforestation. To do a good job in this aspect, the prerequisite is to seriously implement forest and mountain rights and stabilize various forestry policies. Only when peasants are given a long-term "tranquilizer" will they have the initiative to engage in afforestation and greening. In some places, the evil practice of indiscriminate felling of trees has not been stopped, seriously damaging the country's precious resources and infringing upon the legitimate rights of peasants. Local governments at all levels must make great efforts to solve this problem.

The whole society should engage in forestry, and the whole nation should focus on greening. Three aspects of work need to be emphasized: First, according to the regulations of the National Afforestation Committee, each system and department should do a good job in afforestation and greening. Systems such as coal, railways, transportation, water conservancy, petrochemicals, non-ferrous metals, metallurgy, light industry, civil aviation, education, state farms, and the People's Liberation Army and armed police forces should all grasp afforestation and greening according to their systems, formulate plans, and implement tasks. Second, departments and enterprises that use wood as raw materials should adhere to the principle of "who uses wood, who plants trees," establish raw material forest bases, and especially enterprises that use bamboo and wood as raw materials should gradually improve their self-sufficiency in bamboo and wood. Third, comprehensive measures should be taken to mobilize the whole society to jointly reduce wood consumption.

It can be predicted that by correctly summarizing and utilizing the experiences of the past ten years, with the attention and practical efforts of leaders at all levels, by mobilizing the whole society to engage in greening, achieving victories in every battle, and making substantial progress every year, after several more Arbor Days, our great motherland will be even more beautifully adorned in green.

　　十年树木
    本报评论员
    ３月１２日，一个极平常的日子，只因它和植树、造林、绿化祖国大地联系在一起，成了一个有着特殊意义的节日。
    今天，伟大祖国迎来了第１１个植树节，成千上万的人们将在这一天挥汗栽种新树，为祖国又一个春天增添几分秀色。
    俗语说：“十年树木”。十年来，全党全民为装点祖国河山，使大地披上绿装，艰苦努力，做了大量卓有成效的工作，造林绿化、植树种草取得了很大成绩。但是，我们还必须清醒地看到，全民义务植树运动发展很不平衡，现在全国每年大约参加植树的人数只相当于法定人数的１／３左右，有些乡村和城市的部分单位至今没有开展全民义务植树运动。这从一个侧面说明，广泛动员全社会搞绿化的任务还相当艰巨。
    开展全民义务植树运动是我国最高权力机关人民代表大会作出的决议，是属于法律规定的带有强制性的任务，是每个有劳动能力的公民应尽的光荣义务。鉴于过去“左”的教训，现在我们一般不提搞什么“运动”，但义务植树却仍然提出要搞运动，这是因为考虑到义务植树要动员亿万人民参加，而且要年复一年地开展下去，这个事实本身就表明了我国人民植树造林、绿化祖国的决心。
    提高人们对造林绿化和义务植树的认识，不是开几次会作几个动员报告就能解决的。从一些绿化先进单位的作法看，深入开展全民义务植树运动，做好思想发动工作是必要的，但还有一个很重要的方面，就是做到依法兴林。有些地方实行领导干部任期绿化目标责任制，且认真考核，奖罚分明。对无故不履行义务的单位和个人，根据各地的经济发展水平，制定经济处罚的标准。这些经验都值得总结推广。
    农民是我国造林绿化的主力军。没有广大农民的参加，国土要绿化也是不可能的。目前，相当多的农民对植树造林还心存疑虑，因为过去政策多变，年年造林不见林，致使他们对造林能否成功信心不足。做好这方面的思想工作，前提条件是认真落实林权、山权，稳定各项林业政策。农民吃了长效“定心丸”，才有造林绿化的积极性。少数地方乱砍滥伐歪风制而不止，严重破坏了国家的宝贵财富，也侵犯了农民的正当权益，各级政府一定要下大力气予以解决。
    全社会办林业，全民搞绿化，要抓好三个方面的工作：一是根据全国绿化委员会的规定，按系统、按部门搞好造林绿化。煤炭、铁路、交通、水利、石化、有色、冶金、轻工、民航、教育、农垦和解放军、武警部队等系统都要按系统抓造林绿化，制定规划，落实任务。二是以木材为原料的部门、企业，要坚持谁用材谁造林的原则，建立原材料林基地，特别是以竹木为原料的企业，要逐步提高竹木自给水平。三是采取综合治理的措施，动员全社会共同努力减少木材的消耗量。
    可以预言，正确总结运用过去十年的经验，各级领导重视，真抓实干；广泛动员，全社会搞绿化，做到打一仗胜一仗，年年都有实质性进展，再过若干个植树节，我们伟大的祖国将被绿色打扮得更美丽。
