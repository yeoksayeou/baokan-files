Currently, television dramas are in high demand, often spanning multiple episodes or even tens of episodes. However, the recently completed short television drama "White Hill" has gained widespread acclaim for its concise and impactful storytelling. Directed by young director Zhai Xiaofei from Shandong Television, this two-part television drama tells an old story of a "widow's affair" in a calm tone. However, the plot development is unexpected. Through the thick tragic atmosphere hidden in its simplicity, it condemns the harm that feudal ideology inflicts on beautiful human nature, carrying rich social implications.

The China Television Art Committee recently organized a screening and discussion session for this new television work. Attending film and television, and literary critics praised it as a heart-stirring, meticulously shot work with high artistic value. Unfortunately, it is scheduled to premiere on March 10th during the daytime on the second channel of CCTV.

　　从冗长拖拉中脱颖而出
    电视剧《白色山岗》受好评
    眼下电视剧长风日炽，动辄数集或十几二十集。刚刚完成的电视短剧《白色山岗》却以短小精悍大获好评。这部由山东电视台年轻导演翟小菲执导的上下集电视剧，用极其平静的语调，讲述一个“寡妇偷汉”的老故事，然而情节发展却出人意料。它透过寓于平淡中的浓厚悲剧氛围，控诉了封建思想对美好人性的戕害，具有丰富的社会内涵。
    中国电视艺术委员会日前为这部电视新作组织了观片、研讨会。与会的影视、文学评论家称它为一部震撼人心，拍摄精致，有较高艺术性的好作品。遗憾的是，它被中央电视台安排在３月１０日白天的第二套节目中作首次播出。
