Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 29th.

Reporters recently listened in on a dialogue between National People's Congress delegates and leaders from various ministries and commissions of the State Council in the Heilongjiang delegation. The delegates applauded those leaders who spoke honestly and got things done, while criticizing those who gave empty or formulaic speeches without addressing the issues.

On March 27th, a vice-minister engaged in a dialogue with the delegates but failed to answer their questions, merely expressing "understanding" and promising to "study the issues further." The delegates were dissatisfied with this vice-minister's remarks. Representative Ding Ruopeng immediately spoke up, saying, "We hope the ministers will address some substantive issues and not just pass the buck to their subordinates."

One delegate from the grassroots level commented that over the past few days, more than ten leaders from various ministries and commissions had come to the Heilongjiang delegation for dialogues. Some ministers spoke vaguely or beat around the bush, which was very disappointing.

Another delegate mentioned that while they understood that ministers could not answer all questions on the spot and some issues needed further study, there were questions that could be addressed immediately. At the very least, some information could be provided to give the delegates a clearer picture. "I think some ministers were not serious enough," the delegate said.

Reporters also observed that some ministers listened attentively to the delegates' speeches and provided sincere and straightforward answers, which were well-received by the delegates. The head of the State Family Planning Commission, Peng Peiyun, explained the difficulties in promulgating the family planning law to the delegates, who expressed their understanding. The deputy minister of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, Xu Chonghua, seriously answered the four questions raised by the delegates. His straightforward remarks earned him enthusiastic applause from the delegates.

　　部委领导到代表中对话褒贬不一        
    实话赢得掌声  空话受到批评
    新华社北京３月２９日电  （记者徐江善、郑战国）记者近日在黑龙江代表团旁听人大代表与国务院各部、委的领导对话，代表们对讲实话、办实事的部委领导报以掌声，对那些讲空话、讲套话而不讲实话的部委领导提出了批评。
    ３月２７日，一名副部长与人大代表对话时，没有解答代表们提出的问题，只对代表提的问题“表示理解”、“带回去研究研究”。代表们对这名副部长的发言很不满意。丁若鹏代表当即发言说：“希望部长们回答一些实质问题，不能把责任推给下面。”
    一位来自基层的代表说，近几天，先后有十多位部、委领导到黑龙江代表团对话，有的部长讲话哼哼哈哈，或者隔靴搔痒，太让人失望了。
    有位代表说，我们也知道代表们提出的问题部长们不可能都当场作出答复，有的是要带回去研究，但有些问题是可以解答的，至少可以把情况介绍一下，让代表心中有数。我看有的部长不够认真。
    记者还看到，一些部长对代表们的发言听得认真，回答问题实在，代表们很欢迎。国家计划生育委员会主任彭珮云把计划生育法为何暂时出不了台的难处讲给代表听，代表们表示理解。广播电影电视部副部长徐崇华认真回答了代表提出的４个问题，他实实在在的讲话赢得了代表们的热烈掌声。
