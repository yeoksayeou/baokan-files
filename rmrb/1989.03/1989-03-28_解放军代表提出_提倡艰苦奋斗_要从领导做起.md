PLA representatives, while reviewing the government work report, proposed: advocating hard work and frugality, living a tight life, should start with the leaders. Only when leaders take the lead can the call for hard work and frugality be implemented.

Many representatives from the Navy, Air Force, and the Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense discussed during the review of the government work report that advocating hard work and frugality, living a tight life, cannot just be passed down layer by layer. Air Force representative Jin Gong believes that ordinary cadres and workers saving money to buy a refrigerator or a color TV from their regular income is not considered high consumption. He said that this is not to say that we do not need to advocate hard work and frugality among the masses, but currently, high consumption is mainly in public expenses, such as building villas, sanatoriums, and guesthouses, making them more luxurious, and cars becoming more luxurious. He believes that some concepts have been reversed: extravagance and flaunting wealth have become "fashionable," and not doing so seems unacceptable. He mentioned that a military commander went to a meeting in a "Shanghai" brand car, but was turned away because the car was considered too low-class. If this continues, the trend of extravagance cannot but grow stronger. He said that this not only causes economic waste but, more importantly, makes cadres detached from the masses, affecting cadre-mass relations.

Navy representative Li Jing said that the people are not worried about how formidable the difficulties in front of us are, but rather whether the leaders can take real action. He said that in the early 1960s, despite the hardships, the leaders took the lead, and we got through it. Now, the "root of the problem" has been found, and the "prescription" is correct, it just depends on who takes the first step. I think the leading organs should take the lead, making the people truly convinced.

PLA representatives Xu Lili and Lin Guigui believe that advocating hard work and frugality is not enough with just propaganda and education. What is important is strict governance, using regulations to prevent lawbreakers from gaining advantages.

　　解放军代表提出        
    提倡艰苦奋斗　要从领导做起
    新华社北京３月２７日电  （记者羊慧明）解放军代表在审议政府工作报告时提出：提倡艰苦奋斗过紧日子，首先要从领导做起，只有领导带头，艰苦奋斗的口号才能落实。
    海军、空军、国防科工委的许多代表在审议政府工作报告时谈到，提倡艰苦奋斗、过紧日子，不能光是一层一层往下喊。空军代表金恭认为，一般干部、职工靠正常收入攒点钱买个冰箱、彩电，那不叫高消费。他说，这样讲并不是不需要在群众中提倡艰苦奋斗，但目前高消费主要是高在公费消费，建别墅、建疗养院、盖招待所，越盖越高级，汽车也越坐越豪华。他认为，时下有些观念都搞颠倒了：奢侈、摆阔成了“时髦”，不这样做还行不通。他谈到，有个军长坐“上海”牌小汽车去地方开会，人家嫌车土气，不让进门。这样下去，奢侈之风不能不越刮越猛。他说，这不单是造成经济浪费，更重要的是使干部脱离群众，影响干群关系。
    海军代表李景说，现在群众并不担心我们面前有多么了不起的困难，而是担心领导动不了真的。他说，６０年代初那么困难，领导一带头，就挺过去了。眼下“病根”已经找到，“药方”也开得对，就看谁先吃第一口了。我看就要领导机关先吃，让群众真正服气。
    解放军代表徐莉莉、林基贵认为，艰苦奋斗，光宣传教育还不够。重要的是治吏从严，要从法规上让不法者占不到便宜。
