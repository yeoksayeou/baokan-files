Post-secondary education is the most dynamic sector in the field of education. In recent years, many countries have seen rapid development and significant changes in their post-secondary education systems to adapt to and drive technological and social progress. In turn, technological and social developments have posed new demands on post-secondary education. Therefore, how post-secondary education can advance further in the new situation is receiving close attention and emphasis from various countries.

In recent years, the education sector in many countries around the world has developed rapidly, with post-secondary education experiencing the fastest growth and the deepest changes.

Post-secondary education encompasses various forms of education and training provided by universities or other institutions after secondary education. Since the 1970s, with the advancement of science and technology and the development of society, post-secondary education worldwide has undergone a series of positive changes. Apart from the number of students receiving education increasing exponentially, post-secondary education has shown the following four major trends.

Diversification. This is an inevitable result of the development of science and technology, the democratization of education, and the new demands of the job market for labor. It is also the most prominent trend in today's post-secondary education. In recent years, the traditional model of post-secondary education, which is dominated by universities that teach general knowledge, has been or is being broken. Various non-traditional professional and vocational colleges, such as engineering, medical, agricultural, and tertiary industry education colleges, have emerged like mushrooms after rain in various countries. At the same time, open universities, evening schools, and correspondence schools have also been widely used. They have become part of the education system in many countries in Europe and Asia.

The diversification of post-secondary education is also reflected in the content of education.

Reform. In the past 10 years, countries such as the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Mauritius, and Thailand have begun to reform their post-secondary education systems. Among them, countries like France, Spain, and Austria have carried out reforms through legislation. The content of post-secondary education reform mainly includes two aspects. First, emphasizing or highlighting vocational education. This is a problem that almost all countries engaged in educational reform, as well as those that have not yet truly begun reform, pay attention to. Therefore, in the newly established institutions of higher learning, the number of professional and vocational colleges is remarkable, and the scope of professional fields involved is broad, attracting attention. The number of students is also increasing day by day, and the growth rate in most countries far exceeds that of general education students. At the same time, traditional universities, in order to adapt to this change, also make internal adjustments, expand existing courses, add new disciplines, and continuously improve the level of professionalization. Second, coordinating secondary and post-secondary education. Many countries have established coordination and liaison committees to coordinate the goals and content of these two levels of education. After the reform, secondary education, while ensuring sufficient general training, also carries out vocational training for several professions.

Enterprise Involvement. With the development of post-secondary education, the connection between enterprises and education has become increasingly close. Looking at the situation in various countries, the forms of enterprise involvement in post-secondary education are rich and varied. Generally, they can be divided into five categories: 1. Providing assistance. The specific methods include providing economic aid to students through scholarships and allowing employees to take paid leave for further studies, as well as assisting schools by sharing educational expenses, providing research services, donating books, and helping schools update equipment. 2. Assisting in the formulation of educational policies and strategies. Many countries' education departments, when formulating post-secondary education policies and strategies, seek the opinions of the business community. 3. Directly participating in teaching activities. Allowing the hiring of experts from the business community as teachers, stipulating that such experts do not need academic titles to teach. 4. Providing internship opportunities. 5. Enterprise self-training. Enterprises themselves establish educational institutions.

Internationalization. This trend is first reflected in the increase in the number of students studying abroad. According to statistics, by 1985, the number of university students studying in countries other than their home countries had reached over 1.1 million. Currently, countries like France, Belgium, Austria, and Saudi Arabia have more than 5% of their university students being international students. Additionally, countries like East Germany, Sweden, and Japan are actively taking measures to encourage students to study abroad.

　　世界中学后教育的趋势
    施光耀
    中学后教育是教育领域中最富有活力的一个部门。近年来，许多国家的中学后教育事业发展快，变革大，以适应并推动科技和社会发展。反过来，科技和社会发展又向中学后教育事业提出了新的要求。因此，中学后教育如何在新形势下更上一层楼，正受到各国密切的关注和重视。
    近年来，世界上许多国家的教育事业迅速发展，尤其是中学后教育，发展速度最快、变革最深。
    中学后教育包括继中等教育之后由大学或其它机构所承担的各种形式的教育和培训。自进入７０年代以后，随着科技的进步、社会的发展，世界中学后教育发生了一系列积极的变化，除接受教育的学生人数成倍增长外，世界中学后教育的发展呈现出下述四大趋向。
    多样化。这是科技发展、教育民主化以及就业市场对劳动力提出新要求的必然结果，也是当今世界中学后教育最明显的趋势。近年来，以教授普通知识的传统大学为主体的中学后教育办学模式正在或已被打破。一所所工科、医科、农艺学院、第三产业教育学院等非传统的专业职业院校如雨后春笋般地出现于各国。与此同时，开放大学、夜校、函授学校等办学形式也广为运用。它们已成为欧亚许多国家教育体系中的一个组成部分。
    中学后教育的多样化也表现在教育内容上。
    改革。在过去１０年，苏联、南斯拉夫、法国、荷兰、西班牙、毛里求斯和泰国等许多国家已开始对本国的中学后教育系统进行结构性改革。其中如法国、西班牙、奥地利等国是通过立法进行改革的。中学后教育改革的内容主要有两方面。一、强调或突出职业教育。这是几乎所有从事教改的国家以及目前尚未真正开始教改的国家都重视的问题。因此，在新创建的高等院校中，专业职业院校数量之多、涉及职业领域之广引人注目，而学生人数也与日俱增，其增幅在多数国家远超普通教育学生的增长速度。同时，传统大学为适应这一变革，内部也作调整，扩大原有课程，增添新学科，不断提高职业化程度。二、协调中学和中学后教育。许多国家都建立了协调和联络委员会来协调这两级教育的目的和内容。改革后的中学教育在保证进行足够的普通培训的同时，也展开对某几种职业的职业培训。
    企业参与。随着中学后教育的发展，企业与教育的联系愈益密切。纵观各国情况，企业参与中学后教育的形式丰富多样。概括起来，可分为五种：１、提供资助。其具体作法包括通过设立奖学金和允许职工带薪停职进修等方法向学生提供经济援助以及用分担教育费用，提供科研业务、捐款、赠书和帮助学校更新设备等方式以资助学校。２、协助制订教育政策和战略。许多国家主管教育的部门在制订中学后教育的政策和战略时，都征求企业界的意见。３、直接参加教学活动。允许聘请企业界的专家担任教师，规定这种专家任教无需学衔。４、提供实习场所。５、企业自我培训。企业自己办学。
    国际化，这一趋势首先反映在出国留学生人数的增长上。据统计，至１９８５年，世界各国在原籍国以外的国家就读的大学生人数已达１１０多万。目前，法国、比利时、奥地利、沙特阿拉伯等国接待的外国大学生已占其大学生人数的５％以上。另外，民主德国、瑞典和日本等国则积极采取措施，鼓励学生赴国外深造。
