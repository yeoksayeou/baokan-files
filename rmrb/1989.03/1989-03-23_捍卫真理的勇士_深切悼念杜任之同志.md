A loyal communist warrior, an outstanding member of the Communist Party, and a renowned philosopher, Comrade Du Renzhi passed away on November 27, 1988, due to illness. Today, we deeply mourn Comrade Du Renzhi, recalling his early pursuit of truth, dedication to the revolutionary cause, and his lifelong struggle to defend truth and uphold the integrity of a Communist Party member despite all hardships. His extraordinary achievements and spirit of loyalty and bravery are worthy of our admiration and respect.

Du Renzhi, a man of great fighting spirit, graduated from the high school attached to Beijing Normal University in 1926. After stopping an old military officer from bullying people on a tram and being severely beaten, he was outraged by the tyranny of the warlords and the political darkness. In his anger, he went to Shanghai and enrolled in Fudan University, beginning his revolutionary activities. In 1927, after the "April 12" betrayal by Chiang Kai-shek, which resulted in the massacre of communists, Du Renzhi attended a lecture by Mr. Lu Xun on "The Problem of the Intellectual Class." Inspired by this, he joined the Communist Party of China after being forced to drop out of school due to Chiang Kai-shek's arrest of progressive youth.

In pursuit of revolutionary truth, Du Renzhi arrived in Germany in early 1929 and enrolled in the University of Berlin, joining the "Anti-Imperialist League" led by the Third International. He later transferred to the University of Freiburg and the University of Frankfurt, where he studied Marx's "Capital" and "Critique of Political Economy," establishing his revolutionary and academic thoughts based on Marxist principles. He also joined the German Communist Party and actively engaged in anti-fascist activities, promoting the advantages of the Chinese revolution. In the summer of 1932, he participated in the "World Anti-War Conference" in Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, and met with the Third International Executive Committee member and leader of the Japanese Communist Party, Senya Haya. At that time, Senya Haya stated: "The task of the Chinese revolution is first to oppose Japanese imperialism and strive for national liberation." In 1933, after Hitler came to power and white terror swept Germany, Du Renzhi, under the arrangement of the "Anti-Imperialist League," went to London for a period of anti-fascist propaganda. In October of the same year, he returned to Shanghai. Comrades in the Shanghai "Anti-Imperialist League" under the leadership of Song Qingling informed him to use his scholarship to Germany to return to Taiyuan to persuade Yan Xishan to resist Japan. He then returned to Taiyuan. Through introductions from fellow students who had studied in Germany, he obtained official positions such as secretary of the office of the director of the Taiyuan Pacification Office and lecturer at Shanxi University. At the same time, he was introduced by comrades to take on the secret position of communications officer for the Far East Bureau of the Comintern. At that time, Yan Xishan opposed Marxist teachings, suppressed communism, and oppressed the Communist Party. Facing the Japanese invaders' encroachment, he preserved himself by neither mentioning resistance to Japan nor promoting his fabricated "Material Security and Distribution According to Labor" so-called "theory" to deceive the people. Du Renzhi seized the opportunity to participate in Yan Xishan's discussions and debates with his close aides to "perfect" his so-called "Material-Labor Theory." With dialectical logic and principles of political economy, he used language that Yan Xishan could accept, citing ancient Chinese classics such as the "Book of Changes," to subtly and multi-angularly question Yan Xishan, making him feel the need to further revise his deceptive "Material-Labor Theory." He decided to invite some scholars from within the country to "introduce new foreign theories" to enrich his so-called "theory." Later, around spring 1935, comrades such as Wen Jianbang, Xu Bing, Zhang Youyu, and Hou Wailu were invited to Taiyuan to participate in the discussions and debates to "perfect" Yan Xishan's so-called "theory." Du Renzhi, under the pretext of providing references for Yan Xishan, obtained Yan Xishan's approval and, together with Professor Zhou Beifeng of Shanxi University, organized the "Sino-Foreign Language and Literature Society" and founded the "Sino-Foreign Forum," translating and publishing articles from foreign revolutionary and progressive journals and Marxist theories. Comrades such as Zhang Youyu were major participants and translators of the "Sino-Foreign Forum" journal, which exchanged information with the "Salvation Daily" edited by Wu Yuzhang in Paris. Du Renzhi also organized the "Northwest Drama Society" and edited the "Literary Stage," actively writing and performing plays and articles to promote anti-Japanese and national salvation, igniting the torch of anti-Japanese and national salvation.

Most unforgettable was the establishment of the "Sacrifice for National Salvation Alliance" in Shanxi, which shocked the nation. Du Renzhi was one of the original proposers. In August 1936, when the "Baoling Temple Incident" directed by the Japanese occurred in Suiyuan, Du Renzhi was in Taiyuan serving as the political guidance commissioner of the "Youth Summer Health Camp." Upon hearing the news, he immediately posted a wall newspaper with comrades advocating the establishment of the "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Alliance." Due to its popularity, the people eagerly joined, and Yan Xishan, fearing provocation of the Japanese, ordered the name to be changed to the "Sacrifice for National Salvation Alliance." On the fifth anniversary of the "September 18 Incident," a mass rally was held on the banks of the Yellow River. In October, Comrade Bo Yibo returned to Taiyuan to lead the alliance, actively organizing and promoting the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement, which quickly surged across Shanxi. The "Sacrifice Alliance" played an important role in the establishment and growth of the "New Army" in Shanxi and the resistance in North China.

On December 12, 1936, after the "Xi'an Incident" occurred, Du Renzhi, in the "New Youth League," received the "Liberation Daily" sent by Comrade Wang Bingnan and promptly published a special issue on the "Xi'an Incident" in his self-edited "Assault" monthly magazine. It included the "Eight Proposals of Zhang and Yang" and articles by Comrades Wen Jianbang and others advocating the cessation of civil war and united resistance against Japan, which were quickly distributed in Taiyuan and Beijing. This had a certain positive influence in promoting the Party's anti-Japanese national united front and the full development of the anti-Japanese and national salvation movement.

During the War of Resistance against Japan, Du Renzhi served as the head of the underground special group of the Party Central Committee in the Second War Zone Headquarters, led by Comrade Wang Ruofei, and connected through Comrade Wang Shiying, the representative of the Eighth Route Army in the Second War Zone. He used his open positions, such as member of the "Military and Political Training Committee" of Yan's army, to cover up his secret work. He followed the Party's policies and guidelines, doing a great deal of work in stabilizing Yan Xishan's resistance, obtaining secret documents from Yan's army, and promptly providing reliable intelligence to the Party Central through Comrade Wang Shiying. Notably, in 1939, during the first wave of the Kuomintang's anti-communist campaign, the three secret documents issued by Chiang Kai-shek to "eliminate the Communist Party" included one obtained by Du Renzhi from Yan's army. These three documents were printed in Yan'an as the pamphlet "Where Does the Friction Come From?" and distributed nationwide, effectively striking down the Kuomintang's anti-communist fervor. In the spring of 1940-1941, during the second wave of the Kuomintang's anti-communist campaign, Du Renzhi promptly learned of the "He-Baihao Telegram" in Yan's army and immediately informed Wang Shiying to report to Yan'an. Together, they persuaded Yan Xishan on the pros and cons of "united resistance" and "anti-communist retreat," eventually making Yan Xishan maintain neutrality and not act rashly. Therefore, when the Kuomintang implemented an economic blockade on the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, it also choked Yan Xishan, not providing military rations for Yan's army. The Party Central instructed to maintain Yan Xishan and not let Chiang Kai-shek devour him. Du Renzhi and Comrade Wang Shiying, following the Central's instructions, closely cooperated, suggesting to Yan Xishan to "develop production movements" and "exchange goods with the Border Region." Yan Xishan readily accepted. This opened a gap in Chiang Kai-shek's economic blockade of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region, playing a certain role in maintaining the anti-Japanese national united front with Yan Xishan and consolidating the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, Yan Xishan was confused by the Japanese invaders' rampant momentum and colluded with them, preparing to return to Taiyuan to surrender to the Japanese. The Party Central instructed to firmly hold him back and not allow him to openly surrender. Du Renzhi and Comrade Wang Shiying immediately cooperated closely, using "upholding national dignity" to encourage the chairman of the provincial government, Zhao Daifu, to dissuade Yan Xishan from jumping off the cliff. They also secretly organized underground comrades to write letters under different names to warn Yan Xishan. Yan Xishan ultimately did not dare to openly surrender to the Japanese invaders. This had an important impact on stabilizing the overall resistance.

Du Renzhi was a contemporary Marxist philosopher who combined learning with practice and closely connected with reality. After the "July 7 Incident," during his tenure as the head and professor of the political department of the "National Revolutionary University," he wrote and published the book "Strategic Problems of the Anti-Japanese National Revolutionary War," which was listed as a reference book by the "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University" after reaching Yan'an. From 1943 to 1944, he served as the head of the "War Work Corps" in the Xiaoyi District of Yan's army. Seeing that there was a large stockpile of military rations and Yan's army was ruthlessly seizing grain from the peasants, he proposed suggestions and was imprisoned for ten months by Yan Xishan under the charge of being a "disguised" communist "inciting military-civilian relations." He narrowly escaped being killed. However, he used the opportunity of Zhao Daifu letting him read the "Four Books" and "Five Classics" to write a book called "New Interpretation of the Analects," which later became the published "New System of the Analects of Confucius," and also wrote a book called "Ancient Chinese Dialectics" based on his study of the "Book of Changes." In 1944, he was released and taught at Shanxi University. In 1946, he returned to Taiyuan and dedicated himself to promoting democracy. To strengthen the democratic forces, in 1947, he initiated the organization of the "Professors' Association" at "Shanxi University" and introduced the Democratic League organization to Taiyuan. He also launched the "Anti-Hunger Strike Movement" in the "Professors' Association" and published "From Primitive Democracy to Ultimate Democracy" and many articles and speeches promoting the history of social development and "managing" the economy, i.e., socialist planned economy. These had a certain practical significance in opposing autocratic bureaucratic politics, bureaucratic capital monopolies, and shaking Yan Xishan's dictatorial rule.

Du Renzhi was also a far-sighted and creative theorist. He was diligent in his studies throughout his life, never ceasing to delve into them, and could foresee the trends of the times. He published many works with innovative insights and practical guidance, enlightening the masses' progressive thoughts and conscious work. In 1948, when he taught at the North China Institute in Beijing, under the Party's leadership, he participated in the work of promoting the peaceful liberation of Beijing, conducted democratic movements, and dedicated himself to academic research. He successively published the famous poems and essays "Writing Our Era" and "The People's Century and People's Education," creating public opinion to shift the foundation of literary creation and education to the people. After the peaceful liberation of Beijing, his article "From Class Struggle to Production Struggle" had practical political significance and still meets the historical requirements of the primary stage of socialism today. Later, he successively took charge of Shanxi's financial, commercial work, and published many economic articles such as "Labor-Capital Relations and Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit," which played an active role in promoting the economic recovery and planned development of Shanxi. In 1956, he was transferred to Beijing to serve as the deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Editorial and Publishing Committee. He attended the Eighth Party Congress and wrote and published articles such as "On the Policy and Task of Academic Publishing" and "How to Understand the Contradiction Between Advanced Socialist Institutions and Backward Productive Forces," which had both immediate and long-term significance. After being transferred to the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy to engage in specialized research in philosophy and social sciences, he successively published many articles such as "Basic Characteristics of Modern Western Bourgeois Philosophy," which helped the academic community understand modern Western philosophy.

Du Renzhi's defense of truth, adherence to the Party's principle of seeking truth from facts, and unyielding will are admirable. During the Cultural Revolution, he dared to speak out against the "Gang of Four" for Comrade Wang Shiying, was imprisoned for six and a half years, and endured immense suffering. He remained steadfast and unyielding, writing dozens of poems and lyrics, and loudly proclaiming "Eliminate the Four Pests" to express his revolutionary passion and indignation. This demonstrated the integrity of a Communist Party member and a revolutionary intellectual. After the "Gang of Four" was smashed, he attended the Fifth Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and first proposed the rehabilitation of the so-called "February Countercurrent" and the rehabilitation of Comrade Wu Han. Later, despite the long-standing public opinion that "politics is a forbidden zone," he successively published many innovative articles such as "Politics and Political Science Research," which played a certain role in the establishment of the Chinese Political Science Society, the Sociological Society, and the Institute of Political Science of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.

In the past ten years, Du Renzhi, despite his old age and poor health, did not rest. He dedicated himself to the study and writing of works for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics and reform and opening up, publishing tens of thousands of words of works and translations. He edited and published tens of thousands of words of "Biographies of Famous Western Philosophers in Modern Times," providing a significant spiritual wealth with practical and theoretical value to the Party and the people. Du Renzhi's lifelong dedication to learning, selfless devotion to the Party and the people's cause, and his sincere and selfless spirit to revitalize China are unforgettable.

Du Renzhi's simple and frugal lifestyle, integrity in public service, and equal treatment of people, as well as his style of connecting with and uniting the masses and his dedication to cultivating talents for the Party and the state, are all praiseworthy.

Now, the motherland is comprehensively deepening reforms and soaring towards modernization. Rest in peace, Du Renzhi! Your contributions are indelible.

　　捍卫真理的勇士        
    ——深切悼念杜任之同志
    程子华　裴丽生　高树帜
    忠诚的共产主义战士、优秀共产党员、著名哲学家杜任之同志１９８８年１１月２７日因病逝世了。今天我们深切悼念杜任之同志，缅怀他早年追求真理，献身革命事业，一生不避艰险捍卫真理、坚持共产党员的贞操而奋斗不懈的忠烈精神和不寻常的业绩，我们又禁不住内心的激动和赞叹。
    富有战斗精神的杜任之同志，１９２６年毕业于北京师范大学附属中学高中时，由于在电车上制止旧军官欺负群众，遭到毒打，愤恨军阀专横、政治黑暗，一气之下即赴上海考入复旦大学开始了革命活动。１９２７年“四·一二”蒋介石叛变革命，屠杀共产党人，血迹未干，任之同志听了鲁迅先生《关于知识阶级的问题》的讲演，思想上受到启迪，在蒋介石逮捕进步青年时被迫辍学，即毅然请求鲁迅先生指引线索，加入了中国共产党。
    为了寻求革命真理，任之同志１９２９年初到达德国入柏林大学即加入了第三国际领导的“反帝同盟”。后次第转弗赖堡大学、法兰克福大学，研读了马克思的《资本论》、《政治经济学批判》，便确立了以马克思主义的立场、观点和方法为基础的革命思想和学术思想；并加入德共、积极进行反法西斯活动；宣传中国革命的发展优势。１９３２年夏，他参加了在荷兰京城阿姆斯特丹召开的“世界反战大会，会见了第三国际常委、日共领袖片山潜。当时片山潜表示：“中国革命的任务，首先是反对日本帝国主义，争取民族解放”。１９３３年希特勒上台，白色恐怖笼罩了德国，任之同志在“反帝同盟”安排下转赴伦敦作了一段反法西斯宣传，当年１０月份便回到上海，在宋庆龄主持的上海“反帝同盟”同志们告知他应利用公费留德关系回太原策动阎锡山抗日，他即回到太原。通过留德同学介绍，他便取得了“太原绥靖公署”主任办公室秘书兼山西大学讲师等公开职位。同时又经同志介绍担任共产国际远东局通讯员的秘密职务。当时阎锡山排斥马克思学说，反对共产主义，镇压共产党；面对日寇的侵逼，他为了保存自己，既绝口不谈抗日，又大肆宣扬他编造的欺骗人民的“物产证券与按劳分配”所谓“学说”。任之同志借机要求参加了阎锡山与其左右亲信“完善”其所谓“物劳学说”的讨论和辩论，机智地以辩证逻辑和政治经济学原理，用阎锡山能接受的语言引证中国古代的《易经》等书，委婉地多角度渐次诘难，致使阎锡山感到有必要进一步修改自己欺骗人民的所谓“物劳学说”，决定邀请国内一些有学问的人士，为他“介绍外国的新学说”充实他的所谓“学说”。之后，约在１９３５年春，温健公、徐冰、张友渔、侯外庐等同志便被邀请到了太原，参与了阎锡山“完善”他所谓“学说”的讨论和辩难。任之同志此时借为阎锡山提供参考之名，征得阎锡山同意，又与山大教授周北峰同志组织了“中外语文学会”，创办《中外论坛》，译载外国革命进步刊物的文章和马克思主义的学说。张友渔等同志就是中外语文学会的主要参与者和《中外论坛》刊物的主要译作者，这个刊物曾与吴玉章同志在巴黎主编的《救国时报》相交换，沟通信息。任之同志相继还组织“西北剧社”，主编《文艺舞台》，积极编演宣传抗日救国的话剧和文章，点燃抗日救国的火炬。
    最令人难忘的是，成立于山西轰动全国的“牺牲救国同盟会”，任之同志就是最初倡议发起人之一。１９３６年８月绥远发生了日寇导演的“百灵庙事件”时，任之同志正在太原“青年暑期健身团”任政治指导委员，他闻讯立即与同志们贴出一张倡议成立“抗日救国同盟会”的墙报。由于深得人心，群众争相参加，阎锡山闻悉怕刺激日寇，又感群情难拂，即令改用“牺牲救国同盟会”的名字。当年“九·一八”五周年纪念日即在海子边召开了抗日救国的群众大会。１０月份薄一波同志回太原主持了该会，积极组织发动，抗日救国运动很快即在全山西气势汹涌地开展起来了。“牺盟”在山西“新军”的建立壮大和华北抗战中起了重要的作用。
    １９３６年１２月１２日“西安事变”发生后，任之同志在“新运会”接到王炳南同志转送的《解放日报》，及时以自己主编的《突击》月刊编发了《西安事变》专号，登载了“张杨八项主张”和与温健公等同志撰写的《对内团结、对外抗战》等宣传停止内战一致抗日的论文，很快销售于太原和北平，在宣传党的抗日民族统一战线，推动全面开展抗日救国运动方面都有一定积极影响。
    抗日战争期间，任之同志任党中央在二战区总部地下特别小组组长，由王若飞同志领导，通过八路军驻二战区代表王世英同志联系。他以自己任阎部“军政民训练委员会”委员等公开职位，掩护秘密工作，遵行党的方针政策，在稳定阎锡山抗战，掌握阎部机密文件及时通过王世英同志向党中央提供可靠情报等方面，作了大量工作。突出的如，１９３９年国民党发动第一次反共高潮时，蒋介石发出的三个“消灭共产党”的秘密文件，其中一个就是任之同志在阎部搞到的。这三个文件在延安印成《磨擦从何而来》的小册子，散发全国，有力地打击了国民党的反共气焰。１９４０—１９４１年春国民党发动第二次反共高潮时，任之同志及时在阎部获悉“何、白皓电”，立即告知王世英转报延安；并与王世英互相策应、分进合击，向阎锡山力陈“团结抗战”与“反共倒退”的利弊，终于使阎锡山严守中立，未敢盲动。因此国民党对陕甘宁边区实行经济封锁时也卡阎锡山的脖子，不给阎军拨发军粮。党中央指示要维持阎锡山，不要让蒋介石吃掉他。任之同志与王世英同志遵照中央指示密切配合，建议阎锡山“开展生产运动”，“与边区以物易物，互通有无”。阎锡山欣然接受。由此对蒋介石经济封锁陕甘宁边区打开了一个缺口，对保持与阎锡山的抗日民族统一战线和巩固陕甘宁边区都起到了一定作用。太平洋战争爆发后，阎锡山迷惑于日寇的汹汹气焰，与日寇勾搭，准备回太原投降日寇。党中央指示，要坚决拖住他，不许他公开投降。任之同志与王世英同志即密切配合，立即以“坚持民族气节”激励“省府”主席赵戴文劝阻阎锡山悬崖勒马，又秘密组织地下同志们分别化名写信警告阎锡山。阎锡山终未敢公开投降日寇。这对稳定抗战大局产生了重要作用。
    杜任之同志在当代马克思主义哲学家中是一位学用结合、密切联系实际的学者。“七七事变”后他任“民族革命大学”政治系主任与教授期间，撰写出版的《抗日民族革命战争的战略问题》一书，传到延安后即被“抗大”列为参考书。１９４３—１９４４年他任阎部孝义区“战工会”主任，因看到军粮囤积很多，阎军不恤民苦向农民逼索搜刮粮食，遂提出意见，即被阎锡山以共产党“伪装”分子“挑拨军民关系”的罪名监禁了十个月，险被杀害。而他借赵戴文让他读“四书”“五经”之机，依然以马克思主义为指针写了一本《论语新论》，即后来出版的《孔子论语新体系》，还借研读《易经》，写了一本《中国古代辩证法》。他１９４４年获释、到山西大学执教。１９４６年回到太原，又致力宣传民主。为了壮大民主势力，１９４７年即在“山大”倡仪组织了“教授会”，并将民盟组织引入太原；还在“教授会”发动开展了“反饥饿罢教运动”；并发表了《原始民主到终极民主》和宣传社会发展史与“管理”经济，即社会主义计划经济的不少论文和演说，在反专制的官僚政治、官僚资本的垄断与动摇阎锡山的独裁统治等方面，都具有一定的实际意义。
    杜任之同志也是具有远见卓识的和创造力的理论家。他一生学习勤奋，钻研不懈，能前瞻时代潮流趋势，发表具有创见性和业务指导意义的论著，牖启群众前进思想和工作的自觉意识。１９４８年他任教于北平华北学院时，在党的领导下参加策动和平解放北平工作，进行民主运动，并致力学术研究，曾先后发表了《写我们的时代》和《人民世纪与人民教育》等著名诗、文，为把文艺创作和教育的立脚点转移到人民方面来，制造了舆论。北平和平解放后，他发表的《由阶级斗争到生产斗争》一文就具有现实政治意义，今天看来也符合社会主义初级阶段的历史要求。之后他次第负责山西财经、商业工作，发表了《劳资关系和劳资两利》等不少经济论文，对推动山西的经济恢复和有计划按比例的发展经济都起到了积极作用。１９５６年他调北京任中国科学院编译出版委员会副主任期间，曾列席党的八大会议；撰写发表了正确发展科学技术的《关于学术出版的方针与任务》和《怎样理解先进的社会主义制度与落后的生产力的矛盾》等论文，都具有现实意义和长远意义。他调任该院哲学所从事专门研究哲学社会科学后，先后发表了《现代西方资产阶级哲学的基本特点》等不少论文，有助于学术界对现代西方哲学的了解。
    任之同志捍卫真理、坚持党的实事求是的原则和威武不能屈的意志是令人钦佩的。“文革”期间他冒“四人帮”锋镝为王世英同志鸣冤，因而坐牢６年半，受尽折磨，不独坚贞不屈，还履险如夷赋诗作词数十首，并愤然高喊“除四害”，以发抒自己的革命激情和郁愤，都表现了共产党员和革命的知识分子的松柏节操与云水襟怀。粉碎“四人帮”后，他出席五届全国政协会议，首倡为所谓“二月逆流”平反，为吴晗同志平反。之后不顾多年来“政治是禁区”的舆情，先后发表了《政治与政治学研究》等不少创议性的论文，这些都为建立中国政治学会、社会学会和中国社会科学院建立政治学研究所起到了一定的作用。
    近１０年来，杜任之同志以年老多病之身离而不休，为建设有中国特色的社会主义和改革开放致力钻研著述，发表出版了数十万字的论著和译著；主编出版了数十万字的《现代西方著名哲学家评传》，为党和人民提供了具有实用价值和理论价值的一大笔精神财富。任之同志这样至老治学不倦、鞠躬尽瘁于党和人民事业、振兴中华的耿耿赤忱与忘我精神，我们是不能忘怀的。
    任之同志多年来一贯生活朴素，廉洁为公与平等待人，联系、团结群众和热心为党和国家培养人才的作风，都是值得称道的。
    现在，祖国正在全面深化改革，向现代化腾飞。任之同志安息吧！你的功绩是不可磨灭的。
