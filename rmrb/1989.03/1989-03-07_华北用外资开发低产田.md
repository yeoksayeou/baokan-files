Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, March 6th. (Reporters Yu Futan, Yin Jianhua) Recently, reporters learned that China's project to utilize foreign capital for large-scale agricultural regional development—the North China Plain Agricultural Project—has transformed over 3 million mu (approximately 200,000 hectares) of long-term low-yielding drought-prone, waterlogged, saline-alkali, and barren lands into high-yield and stable-yield farmlands. The World Bank recently reviewed the project and deemed the work highly successful.

The areas of Yucheng, Shangqiu, and Mengcheng, among nine counties in western Shandong, eastern Henan, and northern Anhui, are the most severely affected by drought, waterlogging, and saline-alkali disasters in the North China Plain. In 1982, the agricultural sector utilized a $60 million preferential loan from the World Bank and a domestic matching investment of 67 million yuan to comprehensively develop these areas.

　　华北用外资开发低产田
    据新华社济南３月６日电  （记者余富棠、尹建华）记者新近获悉，我国利用外资进行大规模农业区域建设的项目——华北平原农业项目，使长期低产的３００多万亩旱、涝、盐碱、荒地变为高产稳产农田。世界银行最近对项目评审后，认为此项工作十分成功。
    地处鲁西北、豫东、淮北地区的禹城、商丘、蒙城等九个县，是华北平原上旱涝盐碱灾害最重的地方。１９８２年，农业部门利用世界银行提供的６０００万美元优惠贷款、国内配套投资６７００万元，在此综合开发。
