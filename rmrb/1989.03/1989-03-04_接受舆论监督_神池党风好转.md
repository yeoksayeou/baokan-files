 专栏: Letters to the Editor

In recent years, 74 units in our county have been criticized by news organizations. Among them, 62 units and individuals have proactively accepted public opinion supervision, achieving good results. The county power supply bureau, the Chinese herbal medicine company, and 12 other units that were previously criticized have since been listed as national, provincial, and county-level advanced units. The incidence of disciplinary violations among party members in the entire county has significantly decreased.

To strengthen public opinion supervision, the county party committee and government have stipulated that for issues publicly criticized by news organizations, the county and township-level party committees should promptly investigate and publicly respond. Those who engage in retaliation should be seriously dealt with. The county has also decided to invite members of the county party committee's communications group to publicly supervise issues that are highly sensitive to the public, such as recruitment, conversion to cadre status, and conversion from agricultural to non-agricultural status.

On April 5, 1984, your newspaper published a reader's letter titled "Electricity Tyranny Runs Rampant, Farmers Dare Not Invest Boldly" on the seventh page. After reading this, the leadership of the county power supply bureau took corrective actions. They appointed 50 users as supervisors, formulated service agreements and competition regulations, and established spiritual civilization awards, making quality service a regular and institutional practice. This has been highly praised by users. Over the past five years, our county's power supply bureau has been commended multiple times by the Ministry of Electric Power and relevant provincial and county departments. Last October, after the Shanxi Daily published an article by our county communications group titled "The Director of Shenchi Materials Bureau Uses Subordinate Unit Loans to Build His Own House," this director quickly moved out of the new house and publicly apologized in the Shanxi Daily.

From 1984 to the end of 1988, our county's correspondents wrote 74 critical articles, which received support and encouragement from the county party committee and government. The county communications group has had 5 members join the party organization.

### 接受舆论监督  神池党风好转

　　接受舆论监督  神池党风好转
    近几年来，我县有７４个单位受到新闻单位的批评，其中６２个当事人自觉接受舆论监督，取得良好效果。被批评过的县电业局、药材公司等１２个单位，后来跻于全国、省、县先进行列；全县党员的违纪现象明显减少。
    为了搞好舆论监督，县委、县政府规定，对于新闻单位公开批评的单位和领导干部的问题，县、乡两级党委应及时查处、公开答复；对搞打击报复的人，要严肃处理。县里还决定，在招工、转干、农转非等群众较敏感的问题上，请县委通讯组的同志公开监督。
    １９８４年４月５日，你报第七版刊登了《电霸如此横行无忌，农民不敢大胆投资》的读者来信后，县电业局领导人闻过则改，聘请了５０名用户当监督员，制订服务公约和竞赛条例，设立精神文明奖，使优质服务经常化、制度化，深受用户好评。５年来，我县电业局多次受到电力部和省、县有关部门的表彰。去年１０月，县通讯组采写的《神池物资局长占用下属单位贷款为自己建房》一稿在山西日报刊出后，这个局长迅速搬出新房，并在山西日报上作了公开检讨。
    １９８４年至１９８８年底，我县通讯员共采写批评稿件７４篇，得到了县委、县政府的支持和鼓励，县委通讯组先后有５人加入了党组织。
