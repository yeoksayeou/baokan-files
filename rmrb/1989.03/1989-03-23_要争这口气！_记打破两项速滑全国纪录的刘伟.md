Looking at the Japanese athletes on the podium, Liu Wei felt a deep sense of disappointment. The results of the first day of the China-Japan speed skating friendship match, particularly the men's short-distance 500-meter race, were truly disappointing. The three medals were easily won by the Japanese team.

China's speed skating level was lower than Japan's, but the Japanese team that came to compete was not their highest level. Could it be that they couldn't even compete with them?

Liu Wei clenched his teeth and firmly pushed off with his ice skates, his heart filled with determination: "I'll give it my all! To fight for this breath!"

The men's short-distance 1,000-meter competition began. As the starting gun fired, Liu Wei burst out of the starting line like a charging bull, swift as an arrow. Under the glaring lights on the ice track, Liu Wei's arms swung powerfully, his center of gravity low, his form graceful. On the straightaways, he was like an arrow released from a bow, and on the curves, he soared like an eagle. After just one lap, he had left his Japanese opponents far behind and reached the finish line with a decisive lead.

The news of victory spread across the arena: Liu Wei, with a time of 1 minute 17.43 seconds, broke the national record of 1 minute 17.48 seconds set by veteran athlete Cui Hushan on the high-altitude ice rink in Asakawa, Japan, and won the championship.

Experts praised that breaking a record set on a high-altitude ice rink on a plain ice rink was truly remarkable.

The next evening, Liu Wei achieved another feat. His combined score of two 500-meter and two 1,000-meter short-distance races totaled 156.100 points, breaking the national record of 157.990 points!

　　“要争这口气！”        
    ——记打破两项速滑全国纪录的刘伟
    望着领奖台上的日本队员，刘伟心里真不是滋味。
    中日速滑友谊赛第一天的第一个项目——男子短距离五百米比赛的结果着实令人失望。三枚奖牌被日本队轻松囊括。
    中国的速滑水平低于日本，但这次来参赛的并非是日本最高水平的选手，难道连他们也拚不过吗？
    刘伟咬了咬牙，猛地一蹬冰刀，心里暗暗地上了劲：“拚了！要争这口气！”
    男子短距离一千米的角逐开始了。发令枪响，刘伟像一头憋足了劲的斗牛，飞也似地冲出起点。灯光辉映的冰道上，刘伟双臂紧摆，重心很低，姿式优美，直道如离弦之箭，弯道若盘旋之鹰。只滑了一圈，他已把日本对手抛在身后，并以绝对优势率先抵达终点。
    赛场上传出捷报：刘伟以一分十七秒四三的成绩打破了老将崔虎山在日本浅涧高原冰场创造的一分十七秒四八的速滑一千米全国纪录。并获得冠军。
    行家们称赞，在平原冰场上打破在高原冰场创造的纪录，实在不易。
    次日晚，刘伟再立新功，他的短距离两次五百米和两次一千米的成绩相加，得了一百五十六点一零零分，打破了总成绩一百五十七点九九零分的全国纪录！
