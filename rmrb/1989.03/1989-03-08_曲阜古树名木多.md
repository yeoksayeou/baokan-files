In the holy city of Qufu, how many ancient trees and famous woods are there? A survey team from the city's Cultural Relics Management Committee spent two years investigating and recently concluded that within ten protected cultural relics areas, each over 100 years old, there are a total of 17,100 ancient trees and famous woods. Among them, there are two from the Tang Dynasty, 99 from the Song Dynasty, 24 from the Yuan Dynasty, 722 from the Ming Dynasty, and the rest from the Qing Dynasty. These famous trees are mostly distributed in the "Three Confucius" sites—Confucius Mansion, Confucius Temple, and Confucius Cemetery—as well as in Mengmu Forest, Mount Ni, and the Mausoleum of Shaohao.

Experts from Shandong Agricultural University and related fields have identified that the "Three Confucius" sites currently have 34 families and 107 species of woody plants. This is quite rare in China.

　　曲阜古树名木多
    本报讯  在圣城曲阜，古树名木知多少？该市文物管理委员会一调查小组历经两年，前不久终于查清：在百年以上的十处文物保护区内，古树名木共有一点七一万株。其中，唐代的二株，宋代的九十九株，元代二十四株，明代七百二十二株，余下为清代的。这些名木大都分布在孔府、孔庙、孔林的“三孔”，以及孟母林、尼山、少昊陵等地。经山东农业大学和有关专家鉴定，“三孔”现有木本植物三十四个科，一百零七个品种。这在我国实属罕见。
