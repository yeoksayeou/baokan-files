Vice Foreign Minister Zhou Nan spoke to reporters in Hong Kong today, stating that the concept of "one country, two systems" is feasible and has vitality. It is beneficial for Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Implementing a capitalist system aligns with Hong Kong's specific social realities.

Zhou Nan made these remarks during a press conference on the last day of his five-day visit to Hong Kong. He said, "From the interactions between Hong Kong and the mainland over the years, the 'one country, two systems' concept is viable and has life. It is beneficial for Hong Kong's prosperity and stability. Implementing a capitalist system suits Hong Kong's specific social realities."

He added that Hong Kong's management and operational experiences should not be seen as unique to Hong Kong but should be used to promote reform and opening up in the mainland. Maintaining Hong Kong's current social and economic systems for at least 50 years is also beneficial for the mainland. If the strengths of the mainland and Hong Kong are gradually combined, this will form a significant economic force in the world.

Regarding Hong Kong's future, Zhou Nan said, "From the overall trend of international developments, Hong Kong's position is irreplaceable by other places. Hong Kong's future is bright." He hopes to see Hong Kong play a more active role in global economic affairs and take on a more dynamic role.

In response to a question from a Taiwanese reporter, Zhou Nan said, "'One country, two systems' also applies to Taiwan. The current issue is that both sides have not started talking. Once discussions begin, many problems can be resolved."

　　周南副外长在港谈“一国两制”
    香港前途光明　地位不能替代
    据新华社香港３月４日电  外交部副部长周南今天下午在香港对记者说，从香港与内地这些年的联系看，“一国两制”的构想是可行的、有生命力的，是有利于香港的繁荣和稳定的。实行资本主义制度符合香港这一特定的社会实际情况。
    周南副外长在即将结束对香港的５天访问前与记者座谈。他说，香港在经营管理上的某些经验不应看作是香港独有的，应该被用来促进内地的改革与开放。保持香港现有的社会、经济制度至少５０年不变，这对大陆也有很大的好处。如果内地和香港的优势逐渐结合起来，这将会在世界上形成很大的经济力量。
    提到香港未来前途时，周南说，从国际形势发展的总趋势来看，香港的地位是其他地方所不能代替的。香港的前途是光明的。他希望看到香港在世界经济事务中发挥更加积极的作用，扮演更活跃的角色。
    在回答台湾记者的提问时，周南说，“一国两制”也适用于台湾。现在的问题是双方还没有谈起来，一旦谈起来，许多问题就可以解决。
