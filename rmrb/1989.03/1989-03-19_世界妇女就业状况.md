The number of women in employment has significantly increased since the end of the Second World War. According to statistics from the International Labour Organization, the average employment rate for women aged 15 to 64 is around 40%. In most industrialized countries, this rate exceeds 50%, while in developing countries, it is around 30%. However, there are significant disparities between countries. Among developing countries, China has the highest rate, at around 70%, while Saudi Arabia and Egypt have the lowest, at 6% and 7% respectively. The Philippines has a rate of 37.5%, India 31%, Brazil 30.5%, and Mexico 30%. Among developed countries, Sweden has the highest rate at 67%, while Spain has the lowest at 26%. The United States has a rate of 57%, Canada 56%, the United Kingdom 55%, France 53%, Japan and Switzerland 50%, the Federal Republic of Germany 49.5%, and Italy 35%. The Soviet Union and Eastern European countries also have high rates, with the Soviet Union at approximately 75% and Poland at 66%.

The country with the highest number of employed women is the Soviet Union, which has had over 50 million since the 1970s and reached over 60 million in 1985. China follows, with 48 million women employed in state-owned and collective enterprises in 1987; 5 million in private enterprises and individual economies; and 35 million in township enterprises. The United States has maintained over 40 million employed women since the 1980s, reaching 47.39 million in 1985, the highest among Western countries.

As the number of employed women increases, so does the number of unemployed women, and they constitute a significant proportion. For example, in the United States, there is widespread gender discrimination. Regardless of educational background or experience, the unemployment rate for women is twice that of men, and their annual salaries are approximately 71% of men's.

　　世界妇女就业状况
    第二次世界大战后，妇女就业人数明显增加。据国际劳工局的调查统计，年龄１５至６４岁的女性就业率平均为４０％左右，其中多数工业化国家超过５０％，发展中国家３０％左右。但各国间发展很不平衡，发展中国家中我国最高，在７０％左右，沙特阿拉伯和埃及最低，分别为６％和７％，菲律宾为３７．５％，印度３１％，巴西３０．５％，墨西哥３０％。发达国家中瑞典最高，为６７％，西班牙最低，为２６％，美国为５７％，加拿大５６％，英国５５％，法国５３％，日本和瑞士５０％，联邦德国４９．５％，意大利３５％。苏联和东欧国家均较高，苏联大约为７５％，波兰６６％。
    世界上妇女就业人数最多的是苏联，７０年代以来已在５０００万人以上，１９８５年超过６０００万，其次是中国，１９８７年，在全民所有制和集体所有制企事业中有４８００万；在私营企业和个体经济中有５００万；在乡镇企业中有３５００万。美国从８０年代以来保持在４０００万人以上，１９８５年达到４７３９万人，在西方国家中居首位。
    妇女就业人数增加，失业人数也在增加，而且占有较大的比重。如美国普遍存在性别歧视，妇女不管学位高低、资历深浅，失业率是男子的两倍，年薪大约是男子的７１％。
