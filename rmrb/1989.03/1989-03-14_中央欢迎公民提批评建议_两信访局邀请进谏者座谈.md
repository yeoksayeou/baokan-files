Five citizens who wrote to the Party Central Committee and the State Council with constructive suggestions were invited to attend a discussion on information work held by the Information Offices of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. They were warmly welcomed by the attendees.

It is reported that this is the first time that letter writers have been invited to participate in a central government information work meeting.

The five citizens are: Pan Feng, chief engineer of the Achievement Bureau of the State Science and Technology Commission; Xiong Guangchu, senior engineer of the Beijing Mineral and Geological Research Institute of the China Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corporation; Yin Huimin, director of the Supply Department of the China Timber Corporation of the Ministry of Materials; Zhao Wenlu, director of the Party Wind and Worldview Research Institute of the Party School of Weifang City, Shandong Province; and Wang Yongsheng, director of the Information Research Office of the Luoyang Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.

Materials provided by the Information Offices of the Central Committee and the State Council indicate that actively proposing criticisms and suggestions, and truthfully reflecting problems arising from the reform, are new developments in information work. Statistics show that in recent years, 80% of the letters received by the Information Offices of the Central Committee and the State Council from the masses involve issues in current economic and political life, with about 16% of them offering constructive suggestions.

The five citizens who attended the discussion all wrote to the central leadership with suggestions focusing on deepening reform and promoting clean governance. In January 1988, Pan Feng wrote to the central leaders, proposing to streamline the macro-management system of science and technology and accelerate the transfer of scientific research achievements. In March 1987, Xiong Guangchu wrote to the central leaders, offering three suggestions on strengthening the research and development of superconducting materials. In December 1988, Yin Huimin wrote to the State Council leaders, proposing suggestions on protecting forest resources, developing forestry, and strengthening the management of state-owned forest areas. During the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Wenlu wrote to the Party Central Committee, proposing suggestions on strictly governing party conduct. In August 1988, Wang Yongsheng wrote to the central leaders, reflecting the public's opinions on serious improper practices. Their letters received attention from the central leaders of the Party and the State Council, and their suggestions were adopted by relevant departments.

The responsible comrades of the Information Offices of the Central Committee and the State Council introduced the deeds of the five citizens at the meeting. He said that seriously listening to the opinions of the masses and accepting supervision from the masses are important measures for rectification, reform, improving leadership style, and promoting clean governance. He hoped that all localities would handle well the problems reflected by the masses and the suggestions they proposed.

　　中央欢迎公民提批评建议  两信访局邀请进谏者座谈
    新华社北京三月十三日电  （记者邹爱国）五位向党中央、国务院写信提出积极建议的同志，今天应邀出席中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅信访局召开的信访工作座谈会，受到与会者的欢迎。
    据介绍，邀请写信人参加中央机关召开的信访工作会议，这还是第一次。
    这五位同志是：国家科委成果局总工程师潘锋，中国有色金属总公司北京矿产地质研究所高级工程师熊光楚，物资部中国木材总公司供应处科长尹惠民，山东省潍坊市委党校党风与世界观研究所所长赵文禄，中国工商银行洛阳市支行信息研究室主任王永升。
    中办、国办信访局提供的材料表明，在来信中积极提出批评建议，如实反映改革中出现的问题，是信访工作出现的新情况。据统计，近年来，在中办、国办信访局收到的群众来信中，百分之八十涉及的是现实经济和政治生活中的问题，其中提建设性意见的约占百分之十六。
    围绕深化改革和廉政建设问题等提建议，是出席座谈会的五位同志给中央来信的一个特点。潘锋一九八八年一月致信中央领导同志，提出理顺科技宏观管理体制，加速科研成果转移的建议；熊光楚一九八七年三月给中央领导同志写信，就加强超导体材料研制工作提出三条意见；尹惠民一九八八年十二月写信给国务院领导同志，就保护森林资源、发展林业和加强国有林区木材管理等问题提出建议；赵文禄在党的十三大期间，致信党中央提出从严治理党风的建议；王永升一九八八年八月给中央领导同志写信，反映群众对严重不正之风的意见。他们的来信受到党中央、国务院领导同志的重视，他们的建议均被有关部门采纳。
    中办国办信访局负责同志在会上介绍了这五位同志的事迹。他说，认真听取群众意见、接受群众监督，是治理、整顿、改革，改进领导作风，推行廉政建设的重要措施。他希望各地切实把群众反映的问题和提出的建议处理好。
