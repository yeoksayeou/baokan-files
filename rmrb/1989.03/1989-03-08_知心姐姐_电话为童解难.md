The nation's first news media consultation hotline—Beijing 440779—has been operational for a year, with the operator "Zhixin Jiejie" (Sincere Sister) answering nearly 18 inquiries from young friends daily.

The hotline, established by "China Youth Daily" and "China Children's Daily" in March of last year, has received 6,500 calls from across the country. A student from Beijing's You'anmen Street No. 2 Primary School, Jin Yuewen, and her friends accidentally broke a glass coffee table at a classmate's home. Unsure of what to do, Jin Yuewen called the hotline. "Zhixin Jiejie" advised them to stay at the classmate's home and take responsibility when the classmate's parents returned. The children were forgiven by the classmate's parents.

"Zhixin Jiejie" addresses a variety of topics, including how to improve academic performance, dealing with crushes, managing tense relationships with parents, and understanding teachers. She always provides satisfactory answers to her young friends.

When the interests of young people are infringed upon, when school education methods are inappropriate, or when other social issues arise, "Zhixin Jiejie" promptly reports these to the relevant departments. In Nanning, Guangxi, several middle and primary schools had prominent issues with fines, which students were very dissatisfied with. "Zhixin Jiejie" reported this to the Nanning Municipal Government, and the problem was finally resolved.

Of the 6,500 consultation calls, 27% were from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions outside Beijing. Some young friends who were unable to get through by phone sent over 1,300 letters to "Zhixin Jiejie," and she replied to each one.

　　“知心姐姐”电话为童解难
    本报讯  全国新闻界第一家咨询电话——北京４４０７７９已开通一年，接话人“知心姐姐”平均每天要解答近１８个少年朋友的疑问和困惑。
    《中国少年报》、《中国儿童报》去年３月开办的这个知心电话，至今已收到来自全国各地的电话６５００个。北京右安门大街二小的金月文和小伙伴们在同学家玩，不小心打碎了同学家的玻璃茶几，她们不知所措，金月文便拨通知心电话，“知心姐姐”听完事情经过，让她们留在同学家，等同学的父母回来，主动承担责任。果然，孩子们得到同学家长的谅解。
    “我的学习怎样才能提高？”“我喜欢上一个人，怎么办？”“和父母关系好紧张！”“老师不理解我们！”……这些都是小朋友们的热门话题。“知心姐姐”总是给她的少年儿童朋友送去较令人满意的答案。
    对少年儿童利益受到侵犯、学校教育方法不当以及其他社会问题，知心姐姐总是及时反映给有关部门。广西南宁有几个中小学罚款问题比较突出，同学们非常不满，“知心姐姐”反映给南宁市政府，问题终于得以解决。
    在６５００个咨询电话中，有２７％是北京以外的２９个省、市、自治区的少年朋友打来的。一些无法打通电话的少年朋友，便给“知心姐姐”写来了１３００余封信，“知心姐姐”总是每信必复。
