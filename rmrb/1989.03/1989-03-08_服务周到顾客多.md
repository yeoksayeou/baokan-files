According to a survey conducted by the Singapore Tourism Promotion Board among 1,455 tourists from various parts of the world, 52.2 percent of the respondents felt that "shopping in Singapore is the most convenient and satisfying."

These tourists primarily came from Japan, India, Taiwan, and various European and American countries. They had visited at least five other Asian cities and, after comparing their experiences, formed this impression. Statistics show that among tourists visiting Singapore, the proportion of their total spending allocated to shopping was 62.1 percent in 1984, 59.7 percent in 1985, and 59.6 percent in 1986, averaging 60.46 percent.

To further enhance Singapore's reputation as a shopping destination, the Singapore Tourism Promotion Board has decided to hold the first "International Shopping Festival" from April 2 to April 30 this year. During this period, various department stores, shops, and shopping centers will introduce a wide variety of Singapore's famous and unique products and organize various promotional activities. Some overseas companies have also decided to ship free gifts to Singapore to be given to customers who purchase a certain amount of their products.

The activities of the "International Shopping Festival" will not only be held in Singapore's traditional commercial areas, such as Orchard Road, Raffles City, and Marina Square, but will also take the opportunity to expand new commercial areas, such as "Little India" and "Arab Street."

　　服务周到顾客多
    据新加坡旅游促进局对一千四百五十五名来自世界各地的游客进行询问调查，其中百分之五十二点二的游客认为，“在新加坡购物最为方便满意”。
    这些游客主要来自日本、印度、中国台湾以及欧美各国，他们至少到过五个以上的亚洲城市，经过一番比较后而得出这一印象的。据统计，到新加坡的游客，在其总开支中购物所占比例一九八四年为百分之六十二点一，一九八五年为百分之五十九点七，一九八六年为百分之五十九点六，平均是百分之六十点四六。
    为进一步提高旅游购物的声誉，新加坡旅游促进局决定于今年四月二日至三十日举办首届“国际购物节”。届时，各百货公司、商店和购物中心，将推出种类繁多的新加坡名特产品，并安排各种商品促销活动，国外一些公司也已决定向新加坡调拨免费礼品，以便馈赠给购买该公司商品达到一定数额的顾客。
    “国际购物节”的活动，除了在新加坡传统的商业区，如乌节路、莱佛士城和海滨广场一带的购物中心铺开外，还将借此机会，扩展新的商业区，如：“小印度”、“亚拉街”等等。
