U.S. experts propose new concept for Star Wars Plan

Establish a "Brilliant Pebbles System" composed of satellites

	NEW YORK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Center for Peace and Freedom today released that former head of the "Star Wars" research program, Abrahamson, proposed a more effective and economical "Star Wars" new plan to the Acting Secretary of Defense, Taft.

	Abrahamson said that the Pentagon should establish a missile defense system in space composed of thousands of satellites.

	The "Star Wars" plan was proposed by former President Reagan, aiming to use land-based and space weapons, as well as sensors to destroy Soviet missiles.

	NEW YORK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- White House spokesman Fitzwater revealed today that the U.S. government has discussed the new concept for "Star Wars" proposed by the former head of the "Star Wars" research program, Abrahamson. However, the government will not make any evaluation of this new concept until the strategic argumentation is completed.

	Abrahamson's new concept is called the "Brilliant Pebbles System," which is a missile defense system composed of thousands of small satellites deployed in space. These satellites can detect, track, and destroy incoming missiles. It will be more effective and economical than the original "Star Wars" plan.

	Abrahamson said that the total cost of his new concept is $25 billion, while the first phase of the original "Star Wars" plan would cost $69 billion.

　　美国专家提出星战计划新设想
    建立由卫星组成的“灿烂卵石系统”
    新华社华盛顿３月１４日电  美国和平与自由中心今天公布，前“星球大战”研究计划负责人亚伯拉罕森向国防部代理部长塔夫脱提出了一个更有效和更经济的“星球大战”新计划。
    亚伯拉罕森说，五角大楼应当在空间建立一个由几千个卫星组成的反导弹防御体系。
    “星球大战”计划是前总统里根提出的，旨在运用陆基和空间武器，以及传感器摧毁苏联导弹。
    新华社华盛顿３月１４日电　美国白宫发言人菲茨沃特今天透露，美国政府已对“星球大战”研究计划前负责人亚伯拉罕森的“星球大战”新设想进行了讨论，但政府在完成战略论证之前，不会对此项新设想作出任何评价。
    亚伯拉罕森的这项新设想被称为“灿烂卵石系统”，是由数千个部署在空间的小型卫星组成的反导弹防御体系。这些卫星可以发现、跟踪并摧毁来袭导弹。它将比最初的“星球大战”计划更有效而且更为经济。
    亚伯拉罕森说，他提出的新设想全部花费为２５０亿美元，而原“星球大战”计划第一阶段就要耗资６９０亿美元。
