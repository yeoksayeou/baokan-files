The phrase “人无远虑，必有近忧” (A person without long-term plans will surely have immediate worries) is well-known. However, in today's universities, people are acutely aware of "immediate worries." For instance, the dual pressures of insufficient educational funding and inflation have left some university operations in a state of financial strain. In such unavoidable circumstances, some university staff have come up with the strategy of "fighting with quick punches," such as organizing revenue-generating activities unrelated to teaching, and offering short-term, fee-based training classes to secure some "immediate gains" to alleviate "immediate worries."

These actions are entirely understandable. However, the pursuit of "immediate gains" must have a limit and should not be excessive; moreover, in the long term, it must be guided by the principle of "long-term goals," and not deviate from "long-term goals" due to "immediate gains." The result of seeking immediate gains will inevitably harm the cause of education.

Education is a long-term endeavor. As the saying goes, "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people." One must consider the future over many years. Education is particularly averse to short-term behavior; educational decisions should indeed serve the current economic construction, but they should not be based solely on immediate economic benefits. While we acknowledge that the emphasis on profit and the talent market, brought about by the commodity economy, will inevitably influence and affect the operational mechanisms of universities, educational decisions should still aim to transcend immediate gains and use the lever of long-term goals to regulate them. Otherwise, the pursuit of immediate gains and short-term behavior is prone to "going astray." The current social phenomena and certain issues in some universities, such as "emphasizing commerce over education, abandoning learning and disliking education," "not focusing on one's main job, and basic salary not being basic," "big principles not controlling small principles, and small environments not resisting big environments," as well as the use of talent where "heroes have no place to show their prowess, and places to show prowess have no heroes," to a certain extent, are all related to "immediate gains" deviating from "long-term goals."

Education is a grand endeavor for the ages. Today's students are the key force for the country to face the future global "intellectual war" and "technological war." Therefore, it is even more necessary to have a "future-oriented" strategic mindset to guide its development. The current "business fever" and "disdain for learning" that are impacting education are not frightening. What is frightening is that we do not see their harm and cannot find ways to counter them. Today, it is especially important to timely establish the principle of "long-term goals" guiding "immediate gains" in the educational field to adjust some of our relatively blind behaviors.

### “远功”与“近利”

　　“远功”与“近利”
    吴常德
    “人无远虑，必有近忧”。但在如今的一些高等学校，人们迫切地感受到的首先是“近忧”。如教育经费不足与通货膨胀的两面夹击，使得学校的某些工作处于捉襟见肘的境地。在不得已的情况下，高校的一些同志悟出了“打快拳”的防身术，诸如开展一些与教学毫不相干的创收活动，开办一些“短平快”的收费培训班，以便获取一些“近利”，以解“近忧”。
    这些做法完全可以理解。但是，追求“近利”必须有一个“度”，不能过分；并且从长远看，一定要接受“远功”的原则引导，不能因为“近利”而背离了“远功”。急功近利的结果，必然使教育事业受损。
    教育是一个周期较长的事业，所谓“十年树木、百年树人”，一定要看到未来多少年。教育最忌行为短期化；教育决策固然要为当前的经济建设服务，但不可单纯地建立在眼前的直接的经济效益之上。尽管我们承认随着商品经济而来的“重利”行为和人才市场对高校运行机制必然会产生影响和作用，但教育决策仍应当穿过眼前的功利而以长远的功业目标杠杆加以调节。不然，急功近利、短期行为是极易“走火入魔”的。当前社会上和某些高等学校出现的“重商轻教，弃学厌教”、“本职工作不本职，基本工资不基本”、“大道理管不住小道理，小气候顶不住大气候”，以及在人才使用上的“英雄无用武之地，用武之地无英雄”等怪现状，从一定意义上讲，就都与“近利”背离“远功”有关。
    教育是千秋大业。今天的学生是国家迎接未来世界性“智力战”、“科技战”的重要部队。所以更需要有一个“面向未来”的战略思想来规定它的发展。眼下冲击教育的“经商热”和“厌学风”并不可怕。可怕的是我们看不到它的危害和找不到对付它的办法。在今天，特别需要适时地在教育领域普遍地建立以“远功”主导“近利”的原则，来调整我们某些相对来说带有盲目性的行为。
