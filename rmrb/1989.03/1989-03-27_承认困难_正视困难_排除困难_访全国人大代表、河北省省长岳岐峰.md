Some people say that representatives at this year's NPC meeting are afraid to speak up. However, when the reporter met with NPC representative and Hebei Province Governor Yue Qifeng at the Beijing Hebei Hotel, he spoke frankly: "I don't think people are afraid to speak up. Rather, there are fewer complaints and more suggestions and advice."

This 57-year-old governor has unique insights into the issues that cause unease and anxiety in economic life. He said, "In our progress, there are indeed mistakes and shortcomings. People have various opinions, dissatisfaction, and complaints, which is not surprising and not frightening."

During the conversation, he told the reporter about an incident. Last year, Hebei Province encountered some problems with the procurement of grain and cotton. He went to the countryside in Jixian to investigate the situation. When the local farmers heard that the governor had come, they all gathered around and said, "Now the prices of production materials are high, while the procurement prices for grain and cotton are low, which is not reasonable. If we continue like this, we will suffer too much." Yue Qifeng said, "You are speaking the truth. The current procurement prices are indeed unreasonable. But think about it, apart from grain and cotton, aren't the prices of chicken, vegetables, eggs, and fruits all set by you? The losses outside the dike can be compensated inside the dike, and you have a lot of room to adjust!" After calculating like this, the farmers understood. Yue Qifeng said, "The common people are reasonable. The key is that we must do our work thoroughly!"

Talking about this, Yue Qifeng said with deep feelings, "We dare to acknowledge mistakes, face difficulties and problems, which is the foundation for solving problems and the foundation for progress. I think this is a manifestation of confidence and also a manifestation of the pragmatic line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. If we make mistakes, we correct them. We summarize after each step and continue to move forward."

Yue Qifeng said, "Looking back, if we could have made some decisions with a higher standpoint, a longer vision, and more thorough and detailed considerations, truly making decisions scientific, democratic, and open, the situation would be better now. For example, after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the rural areas implemented the household responsibility system, and grain production increased significantly. However, as soon as there were some achievements, people said that there was too much grain and that grain transformation and changing the food structure were needed, without emphasizing saving grain and planning the use of grain. As a result, the foundation of agriculture was weakened, investment decreased, and grain production stagnated for several years. This lesson must be learned."

　　承认困难　正视困难　排除困难        
    ——访全国人大代表、河北省省长岳岐峰
    本报记者  王行增
    有人说，在今年人代会上代表们不敢讲话了。而记者在北京河北饭店和人大代表、河北省省长岳岐峰一见面，他却爽快地说：“我看不是人们不敢讲话了，而是发牢骚的少了，出主意提建议的多了。”
    这位５７岁的省长对经济生活中存在的令人不安和焦虑的问题，颇有独到的见解。他说，在我们前进过程中，确实有失误和缺点，人们有这样那样的意见、不满和牢骚，这并不奇怪，也不可怕。
    交谈中他向记者谈起这样一件事。去年河北省粮食棉花征购出现一些问题，他到冀县农村了解情况。当地农民一听省长来了，都围上来说：“现在生产资料价高，而粮棉收购价低，这不合理。照这么办，我们太吃亏。”岳岐峰说，你们讲的是实情，现在的收购价确实不合理。但是，你们想一想，除了粮棉之外，鸡肉菜蛋果的价格不都是你们定吗！堤外损失堤内补，你们调剂的余地很大嘛！这么一算帐，农民心里明白了。岳岐峰说：“老百姓是通情达理的，关键是我们要把工作做到家！”
    谈到这里，岳岐峰深有感触地说，我们敢于承认失误，正视困难和问题，这是解决问题的基础，也是前进的基础。我看这是有信心的表现，也是党的十一届三中全会以来实事求是路线的表现。错了就改，走一段总结一下，继续前进。
    岳岐峰说，回过头来看，如果当时对一些问题的决策能站得高一些，看得远一些，考虑问题更周到更细致一点，真正搞决策科学化、民主化、公开化，情况会比现在好一些。比如十一届三中全会后，农村实行大包干，粮食随之大增产，可是刚刚有些成绩，就讲粮食多了，要搞粮食转化，改变食品结构，不提节约用粮、计划用粮，结果使农业基础地位淡化，投入减少，造成粮食生产几年徘徊，这个教训必须记取。
