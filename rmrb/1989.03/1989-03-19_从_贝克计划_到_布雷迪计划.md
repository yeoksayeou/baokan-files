Title: From the "Baker Plan" to the "Brady Plan"

On March 10, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady proposed a new U.S. initiative to address the international debt crisis, immediately winning praise from many political and economic figures. The U.S. media has dubbed the "Brady Plan" as the "most important economic and political initiative" of the Bush administration.

The basic idea of the "Brady Plan" is to use the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as backers, encouraging and assisting creditor banks in reaching agreements with debtor countries to "voluntarily" reduce part of the principal and interest owed by the debtor countries. The main types of transactions between creditors and debtors include:

1. Creditor banks exchange debt for lower-value bonds.
2. Exchange debt for bonds of equal value but with reduced interest rates.
3. Transfer part of the debt to companies within the debtor country.

Several key factors ensure the success of these transactions:

1. Debtor countries must implement economic reforms and regain the confidence of their domestic private capital to qualify for debt reduction.
2. Debtor countries can use a certain proportion of normal loans from the IMF or World Bank to buy back the debt or as collateral for discounted bonds.
3. Debtor countries will periodically pay interest on the reduced principal and interest to creditor banks, with the World Bank and IMF providing effective guarantees through a special fund.
4. Debtor countries can also obtain loans from Japan to supplement the special fund, buy back debt, or provide collateral for new discounted bonds.
5. Creditor banks will negotiate to waive a certain proportion of old loans, with the condition that the new bonds replacing the old loans will have their principal and interest guaranteed by the World Bank and IMF.

During the Reagan administration, the U.S. generally opposed debt forgiveness. The "Baker Plan" proposed in 1985 focused on increasing new loans to debtor countries while their old loans were not yet repaid. The emergence of the "Brady Plan" marks a significant shift in U.S. international debt policy.

The "Brady Plan" has multiple causes:

Firstly, the "Baker Plan" failed. Former Treasury Secretary and current Secretary of State James Baker proposed a plan to address the international debt crisis over three years ago, which was met with opposition from debtor countries. They demanded a fundamental reduction in the debt burden that hindered their economic development. Meanwhile, creditor banks were unwilling to provide new loans to debtor countries when old loans were unlikely to be recovered.

Secondly, the international debt crisis, which has lasted for seven years, has been a significant factor in the social and economic instability of some heavily indebted Latin American countries. Recently, Venezuela adopted austerity measures at the request of the IMF, leading to nationwide unrest, which is the latest example.

Thirdly, the economic stagnation in Latin American debtor countries has, in turn, affected U.S. economic growth. Statistics show that since 1981, the average national income of Latin American countries has decreased by 10%. Due to their heavy debts, these countries are unable to purchase U.S. goods, and the debt crisis has caused more harm to U.S. trade than to other industrialized countries. Therefore, many U.S. figures have been calling for a change in debt policy in recent years.

Fundamentally, the Bush administration highly values the international debt crisis, seeing it as a long-term strategic issue related to U.S. national security, rather than a purely financial problem.

In recent days, the "Brady Plan" has been welcomed by some Latin American debtor countries, Japan, and Europe, but there are still many doubts and reservations both domestically and internationally.

One issue is how much debt reduction is needed to alleviate the debt crisis. Currently, Latin American countries owe $400 billion, with over $300 billion needed annually for debt repayment. In 1988 alone, the interest paid was $260 billion, while new loans amounted to only $60 billion. According to Morgan Company statistics, from 1977 to 1987, the net capital outflow from 15 U.S. debtor countries reached $137 billion. Even if the debt is reduced, debtor countries still cannot obtain the new investments necessary for economic development. The question of how much to forgive to alleviate the debt burden is a highly complex issue.

Another issue is that countries receiving debt relief must implement political measures and economic reforms as required by the World Bank or IMF to qualify for new loans. However, the results of such actions in countries like Venezuela and Mexico have not been ideal. Moreover, since part of the preparation funds from the two international banks come from general economic development loan projects for developing countries, this means that the borrowing opportunities for other debtor countries not receiving debt relief will be reduced. Therefore, if this plan does not attract debtor countries, their attitudes may become more radical, and they may again refuse to repay debts.

Related to this, it is uncertain whether creditor banks will "voluntarily" waive debts, and it is also uncertain whether they will continue to provide sufficient loans to debtor countries after debt reduction. Some European officials have expressed that ensuring new loans flow to debtor countries is their focus. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan believes that once banks agree to waive debts, attracting new loans will be almost impossible.

The biggest issue is the financial balance of implementing this plan. Local media have revealed that the financial sources for the debt reduction plan will be borne by Japan, Western Europe, and the U.S. at 50%, 30%, and 20% respectively. For this, the U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary visited Tokyo earlier this month and reached an understanding with Japan. However, it is still unclear how much each country will contribute.

The international debt crisis is a long-standing complex issue involving the interests of all parties, and it cannot be completely resolved overnight. There are still many disputes within the U.S. Congress, the Bush administration, and the economic sector regarding the specific implementation of this plan. Therefore, the "Brady Plan" will face a difficult and winding road to implementation.

### 从“贝克计划”到“布雷迪计划”

　　从“贝克计划”到“布雷迪计划”
    本报记者  仓立德
    ３月１０日，美国财政部长布雷迪提出了美国解决国际债务危机的新构想，并立即赢得政界、经济界不少人士的喝彩。美国舆论界称，“布雷迪计划”可视为布什政府“最重要的经济、政治倡议”。
    “布雷迪计划”的基本构想是，以世界银行和国际货币基金组织两大国际机构为后盾，鼓励并资助债权银行与债务国达成协议，“自愿”减免债务国的部分债务本金和利息。债权、债务双方的交易主要有３种类型：一、债权银行将债务换成低面值债券；二、将债务换成同等面值的债券，但降低偿息；三、将部分债权转让给债务国的公司企业。
    保证上述交易成功的几项重要因素是：一、债务国只有在实行经济改革并能够重新吸引其外流的国内私人资本的条件下，才能得到减债待遇；二、债务国可以用一定比例的国际货币基金组织或世界银行的正常贷款，购回所欠债务，或作为打过折扣的债券的担保；三、债务国为削减了本息的债务定期向债权银行偿付利息，世界银行和国际货币基金组织用一笔特别准备金为此提供有效担保；四、债务国还可从日本获得贷款，用以补充准备金、购回债务，或为新的减价债券提供担保；五、各债权银行通过谈判商定放弃一定比例的旧贷款，交换条件是，替代旧贷款的债券本息可获得世界银行、国际货币基金组织的担保。
    在里根执政期间，美国基本上不赞成减免债务。１９８５年提出的“贝克计划”，其重点是在债务国旧贷款尚未偿清的基础上增加新贷款。“布雷迪计划”的出现，标志着美国的国际债务政策发生了重要转变。
    “布雷迪计划”的产生有多方面的原因。
    其一是“贝克计划的死亡”。前财长、现任国务卿的贝克３年多以前提出解决国际债务危机的方案后，遭到债务国的反对，它们要求从根本上减轻阻碍债务国经济发展的债务重负。同时，各债权银行也不愿在旧贷款回收无望的情况下向债务国提供新贷款。
    其二，持续７年之久的国际债务危机迟迟不得缓解，是拉美一些重债国社会、经济动荡不安的重要因素。最近委内瑞拉应国际货币基金组织要求采取了紧缩政策后，发生了全国性骚乱便是最新的例子。美国“后院”政局不稳增加了解决债务问题的急迫性。
    其三，拉美债务国的经济停滞反过来影响了美国的经济增长。据统计，１９８１年以来，拉美国家的国民平均收入已下降了１０％。由于这些国家负债累累，无力购买美国商品，债务危机给美国贸易带来的伤害远远超过了其他工业化国家。因此，美国朝野许多人士近年来一直要求当局迅速改变债务政策。
    根本的一点是，布什政府高度重视国际债务危机，认为它关系到美国国家安全的长远战略，而不是一个单纯的财政问题。
    近日来，“布雷迪计划”尽管受到拉美一些债务国、日本及欧洲的欢迎，但国内外仍有不少人对该计划能否成功持怀疑或观望态度。
    一个问题是，减免多少才能缓解债务危机。拉美债务国目前已积欠４０００亿美元债务，最近每年要用３００多亿美元还本付息；去年仅偿付的利息便高达２６０亿美元，而得到的新贷款却只有６０亿美元。据美国摩根公司统计，从１９７７—１９８７年，美国的１５个债务国流失的净资本达１３７０亿美元。在这种情况下，即使债务减少了，债务国还是无法获得经济发展所必须的新投资。究竟免除多少才能缓解债务负担，是一个极其复杂的难题。
    另一个问题是，接受减债优待的国家必须按照世界银行或国际货币基金组织的要求，采取有力的政治措施，实行经济改革，否则不能得到新贷款。但委内瑞拉、墨西哥这样做的结果并不理想。而且，由于上述两家国际银行机构的部分准备金是从给发展中国家的一般经济发展贷款项目中抽出来的，这就意味着会减少未得到减债优待的其他债务国的借贷机会。因此，如果这项计划对债务国吸引力不大，它们的态度可能转趋激烈，再次拒付债务。
    与此相关，债权银行是否会“自愿”免去债务还是个未知数，同时也无法保证它们在减债后能继续向债务国提供充足的贷款。一些欧洲国家官员表示，如何保证新贷款流向债务国是他们关注的焦点。美国联邦储备委员会主席格林斯潘认为，一旦银行同意放弃债务，再吸引新贷款几乎是不可能的。
    最大的问题是实施这项计划的财政平衡。此间舆论界透露，减债计划的财政来源将由日本、西欧和美国分别负担５０％、３０％和２０％。为此，美国财政部副部长本月初曾出访东京，与日本达成默契。但是，各国究竟能为此掏多少钱，目前还不清楚。
    国际债务危机是长期形成的复杂问题，牵涉到各方的切身利害关系，因此不可能一朝一夕得到彻底解决。在具体实施这项计划的问题上，目前美国国会、布什政府内部及经济界还有不少争论。由此看来，“布雷迪计划”的实施要走一段艰难曲折的路程。
