　　环保去年办实事千余件
    宋健强调下大决心搞好环境保护
    本报北京３月１７日讯  记者谢联辉报道：我国各级政府的环保意识正在增强。据不完全统计，１９８８年全国各省、市、区共完成环境保护方面比较大的实事１３３１件，比上一年显著增加。这是记者在今天召开的国务院环境保护委员会１５次会议上获悉的。
    治理大气污染是当前环保工作的重点，据对全国３０７个重点城市的初步统计，去年建成烟尘控制区６６２个，面积达３８１５平方公里。为了使大气污染防治工作开展得较扎实，国务院环委会决定首先在３２个重点城市分出档次，提出目标要求，开展烟尘污染治理。
    水污染防治工作有了进展。２３个省、市、区初步统计，去年一年共治理河流３４６条，长达１７９９公里，治理湖泊３５个。国务委员宋健在会上说，我们对环境恶化趋势要有认识，要下更大的决心搞好环境保护工作。宋健在会上宣布，增补国家经济体制改革委员会副主任张彦宁、人民解放军总后勤部副部长刘明璞为国务院环境保护委员会副主任。
