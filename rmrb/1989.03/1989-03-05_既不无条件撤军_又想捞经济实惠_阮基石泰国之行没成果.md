Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, March 4th.

According to well-informed sources, due to Vietnam's insistence on conditional withdrawal of troops, Nguyen Co Hoc's visit to Thailand has made no progress in the political resolution of the Cambodian issue.

Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Hoc left Bangkok for home today.

When asked by reporters whether delaying the resolution of the Cambodian issue would affect Vietnam's economy, Nguyen Co Hoc said, "I don't think so." The Vietnamese Foreign Minister said on February 28 that Vietnam would withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of 1990, not by the end of September this year.

Before his departure, Nguyen Co Hoc also told reporters that he had proposed that the Vietnamese Prime Minister visit Thailand soon, but Thai Prime Minister Chatichai did not give a direct response.

Chatichai said during his meeting with Nguyen Co Hoc on March 3 that he would visit Vietnam only after Vietnam had withdrawn all its troops from Cambodia.

Nguyen Co Hoc's visit to Thailand took place just a week after the second informal meeting on the Cambodian issue in Jakarta. During his visit, he attempted to urge Thailand to engage in economic cooperation with Hanoi before the Cambodian issue was resolved.

However, Chatichai believed that this could only be considered after Vietnam withdrew its troops from Cambodia and the Cambodian issue was resolved.

### 既不无条件撤军　又想捞经济实惠  阮基石泰国之行没成果

　　既不无条件撤军　又想捞经济实惠
    阮基石泰国之行没成果
    新华社曼谷３月４日电  据消息灵通人士说，由于越南坚持有条件撤军，阮基石泰国之行没有在尽快政治解决柬埔寨问题上取得任何进展。
    越南外长阮基石今天离开曼谷回国。
    当有记者问到，推迟解决柬埔寨问题是否会影响越南经济时，阮基石说，“我不这样认为”。越南外长２月２８日说，越南将在１９９０年底，而不是今年９月底从柬埔寨撤出全部军队。
    阮基石临行前还对记者说，他曾提出要求越南总理不久能访问泰国，但泰国总理差猜并没有直接答复。
    差猜在３日会见阮基石时说，只有在越南从柬埔寨撤出全部军队以后，他才访问越南。
    阮基石此次访泰是在关于柬埔寨问题的第二次雅加达非正式会议后仅一周进行的。访问期间，他曾试图要求泰国在柬埔寨问题没有解决以前就与河内进行经济合作。
    但差猜认为，这要等到越南从柬埔寨撤军，柬埔寨问题获得解决之后，才能考虑。
