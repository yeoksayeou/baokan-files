For many years, China's science and technology sector has been content with "doing research behind closed doors," but it has now begun to look outward.

Reporter Yang Lianghua reports from Beijing on March 3: At today's national science and technology system technology export work conference, it was learned that China's technology export value has seen a rapid increase in recent years. In 1987, it earned 1.61 billion US dollars in foreign exchange, nearly equaling the total of 1979 to 1986; in 1988, it reached 2.4 billion US dollars. The main industries for exports include chemicals, machinery, computer software, agriculture, and others. The main export markets are the United States, Japan, East Germany, Hungary, Australia, and Hong Kong.

China's technology export forms have developed from general patent rights and production license transfers to include cooperative production, technology equity investment, technology with complete sets of equipment exports, technical services, and technology labor exports. Technical achievements transfer business has also been established with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

However, it is generally believed that China's technology export level is still far from commensurate with its current scientific and technological development level. The proportion of technology exports in China's foreign trade and international technology trade is still too low. At today's meeting, the goal was set to lay a solid foundation during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period and to open up the situation during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period.

### 中国科技界目光向外  技术出口额成倍增长

　　中国科技界目光向外
    技术出口额成倍增长
    本报北京三月三日讯  记者杨良化报道：以往多年来满足于“关起门来搞研究”的中国科技界，已经开始把眼光投向海外。
    记者从今天召开的全国科技系统技术出口工作会议上了解到，我国的技术出口额近年有了成倍增长，一九八七年创汇一点六一亿美元，接近一九七九至一九八六年的总和；去年则达到二点四亿美元。出口的主要行业包括化工、机械、计算机软件、农业等，出口主要市场为美国、日本、民主德国、匈牙利、澳大利亚及香港。
    我国技术出口的形式，已经从一般专利权生产许可证转让，发展到包括合作生产、技术入股、技术带成套设备出口、技术服务、科技劳务出口等多种形式。同苏联及东欧国家还建立了技术成果转让业务。
    但是，人们普遍认为，我国的技术出口水平同现有科技发展水平相比还很不相称，技术出口额在我国对外贸易及国际技术贸易额中所占比例仍然太低。在今天的会议上，确立了“七五”期间打好基础、“八五”期间打开局面的目标。
