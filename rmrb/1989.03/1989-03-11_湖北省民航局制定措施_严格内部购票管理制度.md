After your newspaper published a letter to the editor titled "Airport Ticket Sales: Public Extortion" on the fifth page on December 24th last year, our bureau was deeply shocked. Upon investigation, we found that on November 13th last year, Huang Xingguo, the deputy director of the cargo department of our bureau's transportation division, booked a ticket from Wuhan to Guangzhou. Later, he decided he didn't need it and transferred the ticket to a member of the fire brigade stationed at the airport. This individual used the ticket to extort money from passengers. The relevant departments have fined him 50 yuan and issued an administrative warning. On December 2nd, we sent someone to personally apologize to Wang Gang and returned the 70 yuan that the fire brigade member had extorted.

This incident highlights Huang Xingguo's lack of responsibility. Our bureau has decided to issue a circular criticizing him and deduct one month's bonus. To learn from this incident, we have drafted four measures for managing internal ticket purchases:

1. Establish a ticket sales point at the airport hotel to handle the sale of excess seats and temporary tickets.
2. Internal personnel must obtain approval from their unit leaders to book or purchase tickets for friends and family. Unit leaders are responsible for the destination of the tickets.
3. If internal personnel decide not to use a booked ticket, they must return it to the ticket office or sales point and are not allowed to transfer it to others. Violators will not be issued a ticket or will be fined.
4. Public security and transportation duty personnel must strengthen inspection work and crack down on all illegal activities related to the resale of airline tickets.

### 湖北省民航局制定措施  严格内部购票管理制度

　　湖北省民航局制定措施  严格内部购票管理制度
    你报去年１２月２４日第五版刊登《机场售票，公开敲诈》的读者来信后，我局上下十分震惊。经查，去年１１月１３日，我局运输科货运室副主任黄兴国，向售票处预订一张武汉至广州的飞机票，后来不需要了，他把这张票转让给驻机场消防中队的一个队员。这个队员用此票来敲诈旅客，有关部门已对他处以罚款５０元，并给予行政警告处分。１２月２日，我们还派人登门向王刚赔礼道歉，并当面交还了那名消防队员索要的７０元人民币。
    通过这件事说明黄兴国同志责任心不强，我局已决定对他在全局范围内通报批评，并扣罚一个月奖金。为吸取教训，我们拟订了４条内部人员购票管理措施：
    一、在机场招待所设立机票代售点，办理航班空余座位及临时补票手续。
    二、内部人员为亲友订票、购票，必须经本单位领导人同意。单位领导人对机票的去向负责。
    三、内部人所订机票，若临时决定不用，必须退回售票处或代售点，不得私自转让他人，违者不予开票或给予罚款。
    四、公安及运输值班人员要加强稽查工作，依法打击各种倒卖飞机票的活动。
