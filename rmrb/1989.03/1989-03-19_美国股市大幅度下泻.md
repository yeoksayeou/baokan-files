	U.S. Stock Market Plummets Sharply
	Our reporter Zhang Qixun in Washington reported: The U.S. production price index in the first two months of this year has risen sharply, and the trend of inflation (referring to the rise in consumer prices) is intensifying. Bush, the President, said today to reporters that inflation must be constantly guarded against, and at the same time, measures must be taken to control the federal budget deficit.

	According to the report released by the Labor Department today, the U.S. production price index in February rose by 1%, following a 1% rise in January, making it the second consecutive month of increase. Calculated on an annual basis, inflation this year will rise to 12.6%. Economists believe that the annual inflation rate will not be that high, but the speed of inflation will be higher than last year.

	After the Labor Department's report was released, the stock market plummeted sharply. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 48.57 points, dropping to 2292.14, the largest drop in nearly a year. Bond market interest rates rose, but Federal Reserve officials said the central bank would not immediately tighten monetary policy again.

　　美国股市大幅度下泻
    本报华盛顿３月１７日电  记者张启昕报道：美国今年头两个月的生产价格指数连续急剧上升，通货膨胀（指消费物价上涨）趋势加剧。布什总统今天对记者表示，必须时刻警惕通货膨胀，同时采取行动，控制联邦预算赤字。
    据劳工部今天发表的报告，美国２月份的生产价格指数上升１％，是继１月上升１％之后第二个月连续上升。按年率计，今年通货膨胀将上升１２．６％。经济学家认为，全年通货膨胀率还不会那么高，但通货膨胀速度将高于去年。
    劳工部报告发表后，股票市场大幅度下泻，道·琼斯工业平均指数下跌４８．５７点，降至２２９２．１４，是近一年来跌幅最大的一次。债券市场利率上升，但联邦储备委员会官员称，中央银行不会立即再次收紧银根。
