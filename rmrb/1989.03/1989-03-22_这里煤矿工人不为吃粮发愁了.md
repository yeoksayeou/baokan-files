Your newspaper's October 19, 1988, issue published a letter to the editor titled "Coal Miners Here Struggle to Get Grain," which drew the attention of the Hunjiang Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Government, Municipal People's Congress, and Municipal Grain Bureau. They held multiple emergency meetings to study and implement corrective measures, quickly resolving the issue of coal miners struggling to get grain.

In response to the high demand for soybean oil and cornmeal in the mining area, and given the delays in oil supplies and low cornmeal inventory, relevant departments took emergency measures. They converted 300 tons of priced oil to regular-priced supply and ensured a daily supply of 50 tons of cornmeal from the processing plant, guaranteeing that grain and oil would not be out of stock.

Currently, our mining area has sufficient oil reserves and a variety of products. Many miners happily say, "Media supervision is effective. The municipal grain department accepts criticism and suggestions, and the rectification work has been effective. We no longer worry about getting grain."

专栏：批评以后

　　这里煤矿工人不为吃粮发愁了
    你报去年１０月１９日第五版刊登《这里煤矿工人吃粮难》的读者来信后，引起了浑江市委、市政府、市人大和市粮食局的高度重视。他们曾多次召开紧急会议，研究整改措施，使煤矿工人吃粮难的问题迅速得到了解决。
    针对矿区豆油和玉米面需求量大的特点，在食油调入不及时和玉米面库存少的情况下，有关部门采取应急措施，将３００吨议价油转为平价供应，并每天从砟子加工厂调入５０吨玉米面，保证粮油不脱销断档。
    目前，我们矿区油库存比较充足，品种也较齐全。许多矿工高兴地说：“舆论监督就是好，市粮食部门接受批评建议，整改工作有成效，我们不再为吃粮发愁了。”
