Title: Not Redundant Truth

The March 24 issue of the People's Daily Overseas Edition used a very small space to publish a very short news item titled "Stopping at Red Lights While Driving." The news item states: "In previous years during the Two Sessions, the representatives' car convoys could pass through without any obstacles. This time, it's different; the convoys encounter whatever traffic lights they come across."

Seeing this news, I think its significance is more than ten times its length.

Why? To tell the truth: people's representatives are the people. This part of the people, when acting as representatives, has the responsibility to represent more people in Beijing to discuss politics and participate in governance, and nothing more. If police cars lead the way for the representatives' convoys, with flashing red lights and blaring sirens, it seems to be asking other people to "step aside" and "be quiet," which makes people feel uncomfortable. Therefore, the representatives' convoys should also stop at red lights and go at green lights, just like ordinary citizens. It is a matter of course that people's representatives should lead by example in obeying traffic rules.

From this, I recall that every year before the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Beijing's relevant officials put a lot of effort into reception work and also do a lot of publicity. The radio and TV broadcast that officials checked the taxis that representatives take, educating the drivers to ensure safety. They checked the hotels' hygiene, fearing there might be unclean places. They checked the kitchens, dining halls, and food, to prevent representatives from getting food poisoning and intestinal infections, and so on. People say that these are things officials should care about all the time, and they are not news. Is it not because the people's representatives are coming that other people's safety in taking taxis can be ignored? Is it not because the people's representatives are coming that other people's living conditions can be unhygienic? Is it not because the people's representatives are coming that other people getting intestinal infections is not a big deal? Of course not. Things that should be done should be done well all the time; only doing them when the meetings start and then publicizing them as big news has a bit of the flavor of making a mountain out of a molehill. I think the representatives probably do not like this either. Don't believe it? You can go and ask the representatives.

Seeing that many truths are spoken inside the halls of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I also speak these few insignificant truths outside the halls. Is it redundant?

### 不算多余的实话

　　不算多余的实话
    马青
    ３月２４日人民日报海外版用极小的篇幅，登了一条极小的新闻，题目只有四个字叫“看灯行车”。这条新闻说：“往年开两会，代表们的车队畅通无阻。这回开会不一样了，车队赶上什么灯，就是什么灯。”
    看了这条消息，我认为它的含义要比它的篇幅大十倍以上。
    为什么？说句大实话：人民代表是人民。当代表的这部分人民，其权利就是受更多的人民委托，到北京议政参政，别无其他特权。如果在人民代表的车队前边放两台警车开道，红灯闪亮，警笛乱叫，那就颇有点叫别的人民“回避”、“肃静”之嫌，人民心里有些不是滋味。所以人民代表的车队也应红灯停，绿灯行，跟百姓一样。人民代表应带头执行交通规则，是不用多说的道理。
    由此我又想起，每年人代会和政协会开会前夕，北京市的有关官员在接待工作上一是花了力气，二是大事宣传。广播上讲，电视上照，说官员们查了代表们坐的出租车，教育司机确保安全。说官员们查了宾馆的卫生，怕有不干净之处。说官员们查了厨房餐厅和饮食，预防代表们吃了细菌闹肠炎，等等。人们说，这些事本是官员们平时就该关心的，本不算新闻。难道不是人民代表要来，别人坐车可以忽视安全？别人住房可以不讲卫生？别人闹了肠炎不算回事？当然不是。应办的事平时认真办好，这叫踏踏实实；到了开会才办，办了还当作大新闻来宣传，就有点小题大做的味道。我想代表们也未必喜欢这样。不信？可以去问问代表。
    看到人大和政协两个会场里边讲了许多实话，我也在会场外边讲这几句微不足道的实话。不多余吧。
