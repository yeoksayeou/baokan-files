It can be said that contemporary essay writing has achieved notable success in describing reality. It has long been praised as the "light cavalry and shock troops of literature." Even when writing about historical themes or landscapes, it always includes the author's reflections on reality, which is a prominent feature of essays in contemporary literature. However, it should also be noted that before the Cultural Revolution, due to an overemphasis on the "shock troops" role of essays and their "timeliness," although they wrote about life, they often remained on the surface of life. Some even became mouthpieces and propagandists for erroneous lines. Entering the 1980s, with the strengthening of literary subjectivity and the improvement of the creative environment, the essay's capacity for reflection has made breakthrough progress. This is most evident in a series of works that reflect on the Cultural Revolution, the "Seventeen Years," and even the entire national culture. In addition to Ba Jin's "Random Thoughts," there are Liu Zaifu's "Sun, Land, People," Ding Ling's "Notes from the Cow Shed," Yang Jiang's "Six Records from the May Seventh Cadres School," and Du Xuan's "Prison Ecology," among other representative works. A group of middle-aged and young writers have extensively pondered society, life, and history. However, such works are still few in number. A large number of essays remain stagnant in thought and narrow in vision. They either discuss specific issues without seeing the deeper connections between things, or they artificially "elevate" the content, preaching tired old clichés. These issues hinder the appeal and infectiousness of essay art. The root cause is that the authors do not delve deeply enough into life, do not study it enough, or do not genuinely engage in "emotional depth" during the writing process. The late famous writer and translator Fu Lei's words are profound: "Art must not only go beyond sensory cognition but also beyond rational cognition; it must enter the third step of emotional depth." (From "Fu Lei's Letters") Emotion is a person's attitude towards things in real life that are related to oneself, an objective existence. It is not only the driving force behind a writer's creation but also permeates the entire creative process from beginning to end. It is contained within the lines of the work and becomes an important factor in the artistic infectiousness of the work. Therefore, "emotional depth" is essentially a deeper engagement with real life.

In addition to the limitations of thought, a deeper engagement with life is another urgent issue that needs to be addressed in contemporary essay writing. The realm of essays is naturally very broad, and the sources of material are very free. However, constantly writing about trivial matters around one, or singing about flowers, insects, and fish, cannot fully reflect the great waves of social change. Reportage can paint a series of heart-stirring "Chinese Waves." Can essay art, which has nurtured it and has not yet completely "transformed" and may never completely "transform," merely sigh at the waves and remain indifferent? Essays can also write well about big themes and major events. "Looking at the Dams," "Sketch of the Rocket Chief Designer," and "The Halo of Tongguan," "The Sculptures of the Times," are all works that directly reflect the Gezhouba Project, rocket launches, farmers learning foreign languages, and common people becoming entrepreneurs, these major events that have attracted the attention of the world. As long as essay writers immerse themselves in the sea of life, they will surely scoop up sparkling waves, discover unique secrets, and thus make essays art closely grasp the "hot topics" that everyone is concerned about, and give reasonable and moving answers, heading towards the "depths" of the artistic ocean!

In the current mass production of essays, there are few masterpieces, and the results are not satisfactory. To change this situation, we need to face the surging life currents and write about the winds and clouds of the times and the reflections on life.

　　散文创作的“情感深入”
    曾绍义
    应该说，当前散文创作在描写现实方面是有成绩的，它一直被誉为“文学的轻骑兵和突击队”，就是写历史题材，写山水风光也都包含着作家对现实的思考，这是散文在当代文学中的一个突出特点。但又应看到，“文革”前由于过分强调散文的“突击队”作用，过分强调散文的“及时性”，虽写了生活却往往停留在生活的浅表层，有的甚至成为错误路线的传声筒和鼓吹者。进入８０年代，随着文学主体意识的加强和创作环境的日益改善，散文的思辨力量才有了突破性的进展，这集中表现于一批对“文革”对“十七年”以至对整个民族文化进行“反思”的作品，除了巴金的《随想录》，还有刘再复的《太阳·土地·人》、丁玲的《牛棚小品》、杨绛的《干校六记》、杜宣的《狱中生态》等代表作品。一批中青年作家的散文对社会、人生、历史进行了广泛思索。但是，这类作品毕竟不多，大量散文仍然思维陈旧，视野狭窄，要么就事论事，看不到事物的深层联系；要么人为“升华”，讲诉着为人听腻了的大道理，这些都阻碍着散文艺术对读者的吸引力和感染力。究其原因，还是作者对生活的“深入”不够，研究不够，或者在写作时未能切实进行“感情深入”。已故著名作家、翻译家傅雷的话是深刻的：“艺术不但不能限于感性认识，还不能限于理性认识，必须要进入第三步的感情深入。”（《傅雷家书》）感情是人对现实生活中与己有关的事物的一种态度的体验，是一种客观存在，它不仅是作家创作的原动力，还自始至终贯穿于创作的全过程，并包容在作品的字里行间而成为产生艺术感染力之重要因素的艺术情感，所以“感情深入”实质上仍然是一种对现实生活的“深入”。
    除了思维方式的局限，对生活的深入恐怕是当前散文创作中又一亟待解决的问题。散文天地自然十分广阔，取材也很自由，但总是写身边琐事、咏花虫鸟鱼，毕竟不能全面地反映时代变革的大潮。报告文学能画出一轴轴激荡人心的“中国潮”，难道曾哺育过它，至今亦未彻底也不可能彻底“脱胎换骨”的散文艺术反而望“潮”兴叹、无动于衷吗？散文同样可以写好大题材、大事件，《望截流》、《火箭总设计师速写像》以及《潼关的光环》、《时代的雕塑》等，都是直接反映葛洲坝工程、火箭发射和农民学外语、庶民百姓成为企业家这些为天下人瞩目的重大事件的作品。只要散文作者沉入生活的海洋，就一定会舀起一勺勺闪光的浪花，发现一个个“独得的秘密”（朱自清语），进而使散文艺术紧紧抓住人们普遍关心的“热门话题”作出入情入理、撼人心魄的回答，向艺术海洋的“深邃”走去！
    在当前散文成批量的生产中，少有力作，不尽人意。要改变这种状况，就需要面向如火如荼的生活激流，写出时代的风云和人生的感喟。
