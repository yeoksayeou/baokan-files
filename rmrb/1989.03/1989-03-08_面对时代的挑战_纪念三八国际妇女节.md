    **Facing the Challenges of the Times**

    **In Commemoration of International Women's Day**

    **People's Daily Commentator**

    Eighty years ago today, female workers in Chicago, USA, struggled for dignity and human rights amidst humiliation and inequality. Women, as independent individuals, challenged society.

    Eighty years later, today, Chinese women in the midst of the reform tide once again face a historical choice. Now, it is the times and society that pose a challenge to Chinese women.

    Our socialist system, our constitution, and a series of policies and regulations to protect and support women's rights have provided broad opportunities and guarantees for women to participate in society. This has enabled a significant number of women in our country to achieve economic and political independence, allowing them to showcase their talents. The achievements of Chinese women over the past 40 years of New China are not only crucial for women to recognize their own value but also significant for society to judge and acknowledge the meaning and role of women's participation in social life. Practice has proven that Chinese women have become an indispensable force in China's two civilizations; social life has become more vibrant and harmonious with the participation of female citizens, filled with vitality and charm.

    Ten years of reform have brought profound changes to our society, and these changes have also impacted and challenged our women. Many women have grown accustomed to having their lives determined by society and to playing fixed roles in unchanging patterns. However, reform has adjusted and changed social structures, lifestyles, ways of thinking, and concepts. The introduction of a competitive mechanism means that every woman must choose and participate in the competition as an independent individual. Society is choosing each person, and each woman must re-evaluate her needs, abilities, and values, choosing the best way of life (including production and work). Only in this way can one actively and consciously participate in the competition. This is both a challenge from society to Chinese women and an opportunity given to women by society.

    Facing these challenges, some women who lack the necessary psychological preparation and knowledge and skills for social change and competition feel confused, anxious, and even helpless. However, the majority of women welcome the changes brought by reform and have gradually adapted to the competitive environment. Reform has enhanced Chinese women's competitiveness and revived the suppressed subjectivity of women.

    A serious issue in women's participation in competition is the unequal conditions of social competition. Women bear the dual responsibilities of social production and human reproduction. Coupled with the underdevelopment of social welfare, women almost entirely shoulder the burdens of household chores and child-rearing. Heavy household duties consume a large amount of women's energy and intelligence, hindering the growth of women, especially high-level female talents. Additionally, due to outdated notions and prejudices, and because many of women's practical difficulties are not effectively addressed, women face varying degrees of discrimination or indifference in education, politics, employment, and other areas. Some say that now it is a race between "burdened women" and "lightly equipped men." This is a problem worth noting, and we call on society to provide equal external conditions for women to compete.

    Currently, Chinese women must uphold the spirit of "self-respect, self-confidence, self-reliance, and self-strengthening," leverage their advantages, tap into their potential intelligence and creativity, and strive to improve their own qualities in the competition. They should become women with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline who can participate in social competition, social political life, and economic life. This year, the All-China Women's Federation honored 1,008 "March 8th Red Banner Holders" and 504 outstanding women's federation cadres, who have made creative achievements on various fronts and at various posts, aligning with the times and reform, and have been recognized and praised by society.

    Chinese women, bravely face the challenges of the times!

　　面对时代的挑战
    ——纪念三八国际妇女节
    本报评论员
    ８０年前的今天，美国芝加哥的女工在屈辱中争取人的尊严，在不平等中为做人的权利抗争。妇女作为独立的人，向社会提出了挑战。
    ８０年后的今天，处在改革大潮中的中国妇女，再次面临历史性的抉择。现在，是时代和社会向中国妇女提出了挑战。
    我国的社会主义制度，我国的宪法以及一系列保护、扶持妇女权益的政策法规的实施，为妇女走向社会提供了广泛的机会和保证，使我国相当部分的妇女在经济上、政治上获得独立地位，发挥了自己的才能。新中国妇女４０年来所取得的成就，不仅对于妇女认识自身的价值至关重要，而且对于社会判别与认定妇女参与社会生活的意义，作用也十分重要。实践证明，中国妇女已经成为中国两个文明建设中不可缺少的生力军；社会生活也因为有女性公民的参与而更加丰富、和谐，充满生机和魅力。
    十年改革使我国社会发生了深刻变化，这种变化，也使我国广大妇女受到冲击，面临挑战。许多妇女已经习惯了由社会决定自己的生活方式，习惯了以不变的程式扮演着固定的角色。但是，改革使社会结构、生活方式、思维方式和观念都发生了调整变化，竞争机制的引进又使得每个女性必须作为独立的人去选择，去参与竞争。社会在选择每一个人，每一个女性也要重新认识自己的需求、能力与价值，选择最佳的生活方式（包括生产、工作）。只有这样，才可能清醒而积极地参与竞争。这既是社会对中国妇女的挑战，也是社会给予女性的机会。
    面对挑战，一些对社会变化以及参与竞争缺乏必要的心理准备、缺乏知识技能积累的妇女感到困惑、焦虑，甚至束手无策。但大多数妇女欢迎改革带来的变化，而且逐步适应了竞争的环境。改革使中国妇女的竞争能力增强了，也使被淡化，甚至被压制了的妇女的主体意识得到复苏。
    妇女参与竞争的一个严重问题，是社会竞争条件的不平等。妇女担负着社会生产和人类自身生产两重重任，加上社会福利事业的不发达，妇女几乎承担了大部分操持家务、抚育子女的任务。沉重的家务消磨着妇女大量的精力和才智，使妇女，特别是高层次女性人才的成长受到牵制。同时，由于陈腐观念和偏见，也由于妇女的许多实际困难得不到有效的帮助和解决，妇女在受教育、参政、就业等方面都受到不同程度的歧视或冷遇，有人说，现在是“负重女子”与“轻装男子”在赛跑。这是一个值得重视的问题，我们呼吁社会为女性提供平等竞争的外部条件。
    当前，中国妇女更要发扬“自尊、自信、自立、自强”的精神，发挥自己的优势，发掘自己潜在的智能优势和创造力，努力在竞争中提高自身素质，成为能够参与社会竞争、参与社会政治生活、经济生活的有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的新型妇女。这次全国妇联表彰的１００８名“三八”红旗手和５０４名全国优秀妇联干部，就在各条战线，各种工作岗位上顺应时代，顺应改革，做出了创造性成绩，得到社会的承认和赞扬。
    中国妇女，勇敢地迎接时代的挑战吧！
