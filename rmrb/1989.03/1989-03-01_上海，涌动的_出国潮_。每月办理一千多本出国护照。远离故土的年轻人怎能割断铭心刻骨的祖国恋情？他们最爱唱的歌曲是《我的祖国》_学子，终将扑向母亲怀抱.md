A wave of overseas study is sweeping through Shanghai. More than a thousand passports for overseas study are issued every month. How can young people who leave their homeland sever their deep love for their country? The song they love to sing the most is "My Motherland" — students will eventually return to their mother's embrace.

Currently, there are more than 70,000 Chinese students studying abroad. In China, many more young and middle-aged intellectuals are either intensively studying foreign languages and raising funds to go abroad, or eagerly awaiting visas. Why are they all rushing to go abroad? Will they return after completing their studies? Our reporters visited a group of students who have returned to Shanghai or are visiting from abroad to find an accurate answer.

Three hundred thousand youths leave their homeland

A wave of overseas study is surging in Shanghai.

Ten years ago, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Entry-Exit Administration processed only four passports for overseas study per month. Now, they have to process more than a thousand passports per month, keeping the staff busy for 12 hours a day.

In front of the American and Japanese consulates in Shanghai, long lines of people waiting for visas are often seen. Last summer, some young people even waited for days and nights in front of the Japanese consulate to get their visas to Japan as soon as possible.

Over the years of overseas study, more than 20,000 students and 10,000 students going to Japan have boarded planes at Hongqiao International Airport, heading to the United States, Japan, West Germany, Canada, and more than 30 other countries.

Shanghai people, who used to say, "Better a bed on Nanjing Road than a house elsewhere," why do they choose to study abroad instead of staying in Shanghai?

Some people go abroad for further studies, accounting for about one-third of the overseas students. They are eager to keep up with the latest research trends and methods in foreign countries. According to a survey of more than 7,000 scientific researchers in Shanghai, 82% of them felt they had "made significant progress," and more than half of them achieved research results.

About one-fourth of the students go abroad to pursue degrees. Most of them are young and promising scientific researchers, young university teachers, graduate students, and some undergraduates.

Those who go abroad to work and earn money also account for one-third. In the recent wave of "Barabara" (Japanese for "loose") to Japan, more than ten thousand people have self-funded their way to Japan, supposedly to learn the language, but in reality, to work and earn money. "Go to Japan to earn a few tens of thousands of dollars, and then you can live off the interest when you return." Even a couple who had just gotten married for four days sold all their wedding items, raised the expensive tuition fees, and both went to Japan.

A small number of young men and women want to settle abroad. As soon as they arrive, they quickly find foreign partners to complete the "three-step program" of love, marriage, and settlement. Some, in order to settle down sooner, are even willing to "match the old with the young" — girls marry old men, and young men marry old women.

Experts from the "Shanghai's 'Seventh Five-Year Plan' for Talent Introduction and Dispatch" project group say: The flow of talents from developing countries to developed countries is a global phenomenon today. The huge economic gap between our country and the rich countries, as well as the unsatisfactory management system, work efficiency, professional development, and distribution policies at home, are also important reasons why batches of young and middle-aged intellectuals rush abroad. A young man waiting in line at the Japanese consulate complained: "I graduated from university at 21 and was assigned to a factory's technical department. I've been 'mixing' there for four years, almost every day at work is spent with 'a newspaper and a cup of tea.' I think it's better to go out and try my luck while I'm young than to continue mixing around!"

The sorrow of parting is like spring grass, the more you go, the more it grows

Some returnees brought back this message: They felt very lonely in the unfamiliar land, with no family and warmth, and many of them often cried because of this. A self-funded student who returned from Japan said: "I met a self-funded student in Japan, a tough guy who wouldn't flinch even if beaten with three sticks, but he cried loudly in the apartment. When asked, he said there was nothing wrong, just because of loneliness. This kind of loneliness is unimaginable in Shanghai."

The loneliness of being in a foreign country adds to the longing for the motherland. A student wrote in a letter to his family: "I am indeed a son of the motherland, nurtured and grown by this land and sunlight. The longer I am away, the more I miss her every moment!" The heartfelt words are the sentiments of all overseas students. Some students who returned from the United States confided: In foreign lands, they loved to sing "My Motherland" the most, singing it over and over again; they loved to watch videos that reflect the spirit of the Chinese nation, such as "Let History Tell the Future"; they loved to read the People's Daily, and as soon as the newspaper arrived, everyone would grab it, reading from the first page to the eighth page, sometimes even tearing the newspaper apart...

Hui Yongzheng, director of the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who has studied in the United States for many years, said: "Among overseas students, there are often such incidents. They often gather together to comment on and even complain about things happening at home, sometimes even saying a few harsh words. But if a foreigner or a student from Taiwan interrupts and attacks, they will immediately refute, saying, 'You also have flaws, you're not that great,' and even fight with the other party."

The prosperity of the country brings prosperity to its people. Many overseas students also offer advice to the Party Central Committee and the State Council while abroad, hoping that the motherland will become rich and strong soon. A doctoral student studying in New York City wrote more than ten reports totaling tens of thousands of words to the Party Central Committee from 1983, offering his opinions and suggestions on ten aspects, including the development and reform of science and technology, economic system reform, wage and management system reform, etc. Every word is filled with a student's ardent love for the motherland.

Even some overseas students who have overstayed their time abroad have not forgotten the motherland's nurturing. Some want to produce more results, some want to earn more money, some fear they cannot fully utilize their talents after returning, and some have delayed their return because their children are studying abroad. Many feel guilty for not returning on time to serve the motherland. A scholar working and studying in the United States told the members of the student visit delegation: "My daughter is now in high school here, and the expenses are huge. I have to wait until she goes to college before I can return to the country. Please understand and forgive me." These overseas students, despite their various motives and goals for venturing into the world, cannot sever their love for the motherland!

They need warmth and understanding

Some overseas students have said: "From the day we submitted our overseas study applications, our leaders at the unit have been frowning at us, emotionally distancing themselves, as if going abroad is unpatriotic." Some universities even charge high "training fees" for self-funded students going abroad. A female student at a certain university who wanted to self-fund her studies in the United States was asked to pay 130,000 yuan in "training fees" by the school. She begged to at least be allowed to pay in installments, but was rejected. The next day, her father threw a bundle of cash onto the school's office desk and left. Some enlightened people commented that the school's practice was "earning money but losing hearts." Wang Zhiqun, director of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: "It is necessary to strengthen the management of overseas students in some units, but such fees are not necessary. It neither stops the second or third person from going abroad nor hurts the feelings of overseas students and their families for the motherland."

Exiles need the warmth of their hometown. But according to many overseas students, they rarely receive visits from their hometowns and original units. Since the embassy also does not have the energy to take care of self-funded students, he jokingly calls himself a "sea orphan." Some overseas students said emotionally: "When we are lonely and lonely, we miss the voices of our hometowns and unit leaders so much!" Shanghai Foreign Language Institute has sent more than 500 teachers abroad for further studies. During festivals, the institute always sends warm greetings and New Year's cards to them. A teacher studying in West Germany wrote back: "Every time during the festival, when I yearn for my family and dream of the campus, I receive the institute's greetings and New Year's cards, and I feel endless warmth in my heart!" Currently, most people in the institute have returned after completing their studies.

The handling of overstayed students has always been a difficult point in overseas study work. Some units simply "remove their names," also hurting many people's self-esteem. A certain institute in Shanghai has an assistant researcher who overstayed in the United States. He is very outstanding in his field, but his annual research funding in China is only 2,000 yuan, making it impossible for him to work, while in the United States, it is $240,000. After being removed from the list, he cried and said: "My life is limited, a scientist cannot be away from research for a day, I am not willing to be idle and continue my research in the United States!" Shanghai conducted a questionnaire survey of 324 returned scholars, and in the column "How to deal with overstayed public-funded overseas students," most people did not agree with the method of "removal," suggesting the use of "automatic resignation" and stating "welcome to return to participate in the construction of the motherland in the future."

Going abroad is difficult, and sometimes finding a job back home is also difficult. This is a concern for self-funded overseas students. Some units are very sympathetic and try their best to help, but some units simply ignore it. Two kinds of feelings, two kinds of results. A few years ago, Dr. Ai Xiaobai, who studied physics in the United States, began looking for a job. "My career is in the motherland, please accept me!" He wrote to 11 units, including Fudan University, Shanghai Railway University, Shanghai Urban Construction University, Zhejiang University, and Nanjing University, seeking employment. The results were that only Fudan and Zhejiang University replied politely, while the others were silent. Ai Xiaobai and many other students were very painful, and friends and relatives advised him to stay in the United States, at least for a few more years. Fortunately, the Shanghai Institute of Atomic Energy, which values talents, knew about this information, appreciated Ai Xiaobai's firm patriotic feelings, and hired him at the fastest speed last August. On the day he reported for duty, he was so excited that he held the director's hand for a long time.

Where there is spring breeze, there will be summer rain. On one side, there is unwavering sincerity, and on the other side, there is understanding and trust. The two sides flow together. Students will eventually return to the "mother's" embrace.

　　上海，涌动的“出国潮”。每月办理一千多本出国护照。远离故土的年轻人怎能割断铭心刻骨的祖国恋情？
    他们最爱唱的歌曲是《我的祖国》——
    学子，终将扑向母亲怀抱
    新华社记者  邬鸣飞  刘军
    我国目前在国外的留学人员已有７万余人。在国内，还有更多的中青年知识分子或在抓紧攻读外语、筹资出国，或在翘首等待签证……他们为什么争相出国？他们学成后是否归来？记者在上海走访一批学成归国或回沪探亲的留学人员，想找到一个准确的答案。
    三万儿女飞离故土
    一股“出国潮”在上海涌动。
    市公安局出入境管理处１０年前每月办理４本出国护照，如今竟要办理１０００多本，弄得工作人员天天忙碌１２个小时。
    在美国、日本驻沪总领事馆门前，时常可以看到等待办理出国签证的“长龙”。去年夏天，有些青年为了早日获得赴日签证，居然在日本领事馆前守候了几天几夜。
    数年的出国热潮中，全市共有２万余名留学人员和１万名赴日就读生在虹桥国际机场登机，飞往美国、日本、联邦德国和加拿大等３０多个国家。
    向来“宁要南京路上的一张床，勿要外地一栋房”的上海人，为何在“留洋”与“留沪”之间，纷纷选择了前者？
    有些人是去进修，这部分人约占出国留学人员的１／３。他们急于到异国他乡跟踪掌握世界最新研究动向和方法。据对上海市７０００余名出国科研人员的调查，有８２％的人认为“颇有收获”，一半多人取得了科研成果。
    有１／４的人是去攻读学位。他们多数是年轻有为的科研人员、高校青年教师、研究生，也有一些大学生。
    打工赚洋钱者也占１／３。仅上海近年来“巴拉巴拉”（日语，意思是“松散”）东渡日本热潮中，就有上万人自费赴日，名曰学习语言，实为打工“扒分”（即赚钱）。“到日本去赚它几万元，回来后坐吃利息也够了。”有一对领结婚证才４天的新婚夫妇也卖掉所有结婚用品，凑齐了昂贵的学费后双双东渡。
    极少数青年男女是想去国外定居。他们一到国外，就急急忙忙找外国伴侣，完成恋爱、结婚、定居“三部曲”。有的为了早日定居，甚至愿意“老少配”——姑娘嫁给老头，小伙子娶了老太。
    “上海市‘七五’期间智力引进与派出”课题组的专家们说：发展中国家的人才源源流向发达国家，已是当今全球性的“国际现象”。我国与富国经济上的巨大“落差”，加上国内管理体制、办事效率、发挥专业特长、分配政策等方面的不尽如人意，也是一批批中青年知识分子涌向海外的重要原因。一位在日本领事馆前等候签证的青年抱怨：“我２１岁大学毕业分配到工厂技术部门，已经‘混’了４年，几乎每天上班‘一张报纸一杯茶’打发日子。我想与其再混，不如趁年轻出去闯一闯！”
    离恨恰如春草，更行更远还生
    一些学成回国者带回了这样的信息：他们在陌生的国土上感到很寂寞，没有亲人和温暖，许多人为此经常落泪。一位从日本回来的自费留学生说：“我在日本认识一个自费生，是个三棍子下去不缩头的铁汉，竟然会在公寓里嚎啕大哭。一问，啥事也没有，就因为孤独。这种孤独感在上海是怎么也想象不出来的。”
    身居异国的孤独，更添对祖国的思恋。一位留学人员在给家人的信中说：“我到底是祖国的儿子，是这块土地上的水土和阳光哺育长大的。离别久了，离开远了，我更加时刻想念她！”充满深情的话语，正是广大留学人员的心曲。一些从美国回来的留学生倾诉：在异国他乡，他们平时最爱唱《我的祖国》，唱了一遍又一遍；最爱欣赏《让历史告诉未来》等体现中华民族精神的录像片；最爱看《人民日报》，报纸一来，大家都抢啊，从一版看到八版，有时把报纸也翻烂了……
    曾留美多年的中国科学院上海有机化学研究所所长惠永正说：“在留学人员中还常有这样的事，他们也经常在一起对国内发生的事评头品足，甚至发点牢骚，讲几句气话。但如果有外国人或台湾学生插嘴攻击，他们会立即群起而反驳，说‘你们也有缺点，你们也不怎么样’，甚至与对方打起来。”
    国盛我盛。许多留学人员还在海外向党中央、国务院献计献策，企盼祖国早日富强。留学美国纽约市立大学的一位博士生，自１９８３年起先后三次给党中央写了十几万字的报告，就科技的发展与改革、经济体制改革、工资与管理体制改革等十个方面发表了自己的看法和建议。字里行间，包蕴着一个学子对祖国的炽烈情感。
    即便是一些逾期不归的留学人员，也没忘祖国养育之情。他们有的想多出一些成果，有的想多赚一点钱，有的怕回来后无法发挥特长，也有的因孩子在国外念书而延长了留学时间。不少人为未能按时回来报效祖国而内疚。一位在美国一边工作一边进修的学者对留学生慰问团的同志说：“我的女儿现在在这里上高中，费用很大，我要等女儿上大学后才能回国，请祖国人民理解和谅解。”　　这些海外学子尽管怀着各种动机和目标在闯荡世界，但千山万水，隔不断、抹不了他们对祖国的一片恋情！
    他们需要温情和理解
    一些出国留学人员诉说：“我们从递交出国申请那天起，单位领导就对我们搭拉着脸，感情上马上疏远，好像出国就是不爱国。”有的高校甚至对自费出国的学生收取高额“培养费”。某大学１名女学生要求自费留美，学校曾要其缴纳１．３万元“培养费”，她恳求至少能分期付款，但被一口拒绝。第２天，其父将一包钞票扔到学校办公室扭头就走。一些有识之士评价学校的这类做法是“收了一笔钱，失去了一颗心。”中国科学院上海分院院长王志勤说：“有的单位出国人员过于集中，加强管理是必要的，但如此收费大可不必，既限不住第二、第三个人出国，又伤害了出国留学人员及其家属对祖国的情感。”
    游子在外，更需要家乡的温情。但据不少留学人员反映，他们在国外很少受到故乡和原单位的慰问。由于大使馆也没有精力顾及的自费留学人员，他便更是戏谑地自称是“海外孤儿”。一些留学人员动情地说：“在寂寞孤独的时候，我们多么想听听来自故乡和本单位领导的声音啊！”上海外国语学院先后有５００多名教师出国进修，逢年过节，学院总要向他们寄去热情洋溢的慰问信和贺年卡。一位在联邦德国进修的教师回信说：“每逢佳节，当我翘首校园，梦萦家人之际，收到院里寄来的慰问信和贺年卡，我心里感到无限的温暖！”目前，全院大多数人已经学成归来。
    对逾期不归者的处理，始终是留学工作的难点。有些单位一概“除名”，也伤了不少人的自尊心。上海某所一位留美期满不归的助理研究员，业务上很冒尖，但他在国内每年的科研经费才２０００元，无法开展工作，而在美国是２．４万美元。他被除名后边哭边说：“我生命是有限的，科学家一天也不能离开科研，我是不愿意闲着才留在美国继续开展研究的！”上海市曾对３２４位归国学者进行过一次问卷调查，在“如何对待逾期不归的公费出国人员”一栏中，大多数人不主张采取“除名”的办法，建议用“自动离职”４字为好，并写明“欢迎今后回来参加祖国建设”。
    出国难，有时回国找工作也难。这是自费出国留学人员的一桩心事。对此，有些单位十分同情，想方设法给予帮助，然而有些单位却爱理不理。两种情感，两种效果。留美物理学博士艾小白几年前就开始联系工作。“我的事业在祖国，请收下我吧！”他先后给复旦大学、上海铁道学院、上海城市建筑学院、杭州大学、南京大学等１１个单位写信求职，结果除复旦、杭大回信婉言谢绝外，其它的都石沉大海。艾小白与许多留学生为此十分痛苦，亲朋好友纷纷劝他留在美国，至少再多呆几年。幸好，惜才如命的上海原子核所知道了这一信息，赞赏艾小白坚定的报国之情，去年８月以最快的速度聘用了他。报到那一天，他激动得握住所领导的手久久不放。
    有春风定有夏雨。一边是始终如一的赤诚，一边是理解和信任，两者汇流交融。学子，终将扑向“母亲”的怀抱！（新华社供本报专稿）
