The comic strip "Trial" by Sheng Keshen, originally published in the "Environmental Science Popularization Comic Collection," vividly depicts the consequences of environmental pollution and the urgent need for environmental protection. Through a series of humorous and thought-provoking illustrations, the comic strip highlights the impact of human activities on the environment and the importance of sustainable practices.

The story begins with a courtroom scene where various elements of nature—such as trees, rivers, and animals—are on trial for causing environmental degradation. The judge, representing the voice of reason, presides over the case, questioning the defendants about their actions and the harm they have caused. The defendants, in turn, argue that their actions are a result of human activities and the lack of environmental awareness.

The comic strip uses satire to expose the irony of blaming nature for problems that are primarily caused by human behavior. It emphasizes the need for individuals and society as a whole to take responsibility for environmental protection. The illustrations are both entertaining and educational, making complex environmental issues accessible to a wide audience.

Through its engaging narrative and vivid imagery, "Trial" serves as a powerful call to action, urging readers to reflect on their own environmental practices and to support efforts to protect and preserve the natural world. The comic strip underscores the importance of environmental education and the role of individuals in promoting sustainable development.
