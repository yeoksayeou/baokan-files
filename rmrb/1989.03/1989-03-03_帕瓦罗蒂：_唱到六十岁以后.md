Just after the New Year, London newspapers published large advertisements announcing that Pavarotti would be performing there this summer. Opera lovers will not forget that it was in 1963 that Pavarotti first gained fame by performing "La Bohème" in London.

No singer in the world today has received as many accolades as Pavarotti. In Italy, there is not a single day without hearing his voice. When he arrives in Paris, posters are everywhere, as if a presidential election is imminent. 35 million records are sold out in a few days, and tickets for a 2000-franc evening performance are snatched up within two hours. From Monte Carlo to Scandinavia, from Rome to Salzburg, from Vienna to New York, he tirelessly travels the world, with his performance schedule already set until 1992. This 54-year-old tenor king is at the peak of his career.

Pavarotti regards music as his life: "Without music, I cannot live." He loves all kinds of music and believes that "if handled well, rock music and pop songs can be as beautiful as operas." To prolong his artistic life, he sings incessantly, averaging one performance every three days, and performing more than 120 times a year. He has sung "La Bohème" so many times that he can't even remember the exact number. Yet, every performance is as exciting as the first time, reminding him of his father, a baker who loved to hum tunes, and his mother, who worked in a tobacco factory. It was she who persuaded her 26-year-old son to pursue a singing career, thereby changing his life and making him a globally renowned king of song.

Pavarotti's daily routine is strictly disciplined. Before each performance, he sleeps for a whole day, and he ensures at least 8 hours of sleep daily. He enjoys good food and has a hearty appetite, but he must control himself when he thinks of his 125-kilogram weight. Sometimes, for the sake of rehearsing a role, he will not hesitate to diet. To protect his voice, he rarely goes out in winter, and when he does, he covers his nose. His favorite sports are indoor cycling, tennis, and table tennis. To keep his mind sharp, he often plays chess with friends and engages in word games. Like many celebrities, he has his quirks. He is afraid of women wearing purple, avoids the number 17, and believes seeing a nail is unlucky.

In Pavarotti's memory, the most unforgettable experience was his visit to China three years ago. There, he conquered 500 million television viewers in one night. In Beijing, he received an unprecedented honor, performing on the stage of the Great Hall of the People. Below the stage, 10,000 lucky audience members enthusiastically cheered for every song he sang.

Pavarotti owns a luxurious, elegant classical-style mansion in his hometown, where his wife and three daughters live. Being with them is his happiest moment. He has bought 443 hectares of land around his mansion, planning to farm it personally after retiring from the stage.

How long does he plan to continue singing? "If my body remains in good condition and I can continue to lose weight, I believe I can sing until after sixty." Pavarotti's dream is to perform Wagner's "Lohengrin" and Massenet's "Werther."

### 帕瓦罗蒂：“唱到六十岁以后”

    帕瓦罗蒂：“唱到六十岁以后”
    廖晓英
    新年刚过，伦敦的报纸就刊出了帕瓦罗蒂将于今夏来这里演出的大幅广告。喜爱歌剧的人们不会忘记，1963年帕瓦罗蒂正是在这里演唱《波希米亚人》而一举成名的。
    当今世界歌坛上没有一位歌唱家获得过帕瓦罗蒂那样多的桂冠。在意大利，没有一天听不到他的歌声。他来到巴黎，铺天盖地的海报犹如总统大选将至，3500万张唱片几日间告罄，2000法郎的晚会入场券两小时一抢而空。从蒙特卡罗到斯堪的那维亚；从罗马到萨尔茨堡；从维也纳到纽约，他不知疲倦地穿梭于世界各地，演出日程已安排到1992年。这位54岁的男高音歌王正处于艺术生涯的顶峰。
    帕瓦罗蒂视音乐为生命：“没有音乐我无法生活。”他酷爱各种音乐，认为“只要处理得好，摇滚乐、流行歌曲也会像优美的歌剧一样动听”。为延长艺术生命，他不停地演唱，平均三天演一场，每年演出多达120场次。那出《波希米亚人》他到底唱了多少遍，自己也记不清。可每次唱来总是那样激动，眼前总能看到他那位爱哼唱小调的当面包师的父亲，还有在烟厂做工的母亲，是她当年说服了26岁的儿子投身歌唱事业，从此改变了他的生活道路，成为风靡全球的一代歌王。
    帕瓦罗蒂的生活起居严格有序。在每场演出前，他总要睡上一整天，平常也要保证8小时的睡眠。他喜美食，胃口极好，不过每每想到自己125公斤的体重，就不得不有所节制。有时为排演角色的需要，他会毫不犹豫地节食。为保护嗓子，他冬天很少在户外活动，出门连鼻子也不敢外露。他最喜爱的运动是室内健身车、网球和乒乓球。为了保持思维敏捷，他也常约朋友下棋，做文字游戏。像许多名人一样，他也有怪癖。他怕见着紫色衣服的妇女，忌讳17这个数，并且认为见到钉子不吉利。
    在帕瓦罗蒂的记忆里，最让他难忘的是三年前的中国之行。在那里，他一夜之间征服了5亿电视观众。北京人给了他前所未有的殊荣，把他请上了人民大会堂的舞台。台下，一万名幸运的观众为他的每一首歌忘情地欢呼。
    帕瓦罗蒂在他的家乡拥有一所豪华、典雅的古典式住宅，那里有他的爱妻和三个女儿。与他们在一起是他最幸福的时刻。他在住宅周围买下443公顷地，准备退出舞台后亲自耕作。
    他打算一直唱到什么时候呢？“如果身体依然很好，并且能不断减肥，我相信能唱到60岁以后。”帕瓦罗蒂的梦想是排演瓦格纳的《罗亨格林》和马斯内的《维特》。（附图片）
