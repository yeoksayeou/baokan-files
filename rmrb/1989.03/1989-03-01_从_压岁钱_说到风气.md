During the Spring Festival, I heard an interesting story. A manager of an enterprise went to visit a superior leader's home to pay New Year's greetings and gave the leader's child 100 yuan as a red envelope. The child, upon receiving the 100-yuan bill, wanted to go out and buy balloons. The child's mother quickly pulled the little one into the room, took out a 1-yuan coin, and wanted to exchange it for the large bill. The child refused to give it up, arguing, "The uncle gave it to me!" The mother glared at the child and said, "Given to you? Why don't other uncles give you so much red envelope money? It's because your father is his superior! Do you understand? Give it to me quickly!"

The child is still young and how can they understand such complex and subtle interpersonal relationships?

According to what I have heard and seen, this Spring Festival, giving red envelopes to superiors' children or sending New Year's gifts to elderly relatives of those in power is not an isolated phenomenon. This might be a new trend in unhealthy social customs. As the lady mentioned above pointed out, these people, whether giving red envelopes or New Year's gifts, are merely taking advantage of the occasion to curry favor with leaders or those in power. Isn't that right? Nowadays, we emphasize the need for integrity and oppose gift-giving and bribery. Normally, giving things to leaders is not so "above board." However, during the New Year, giving red envelopes to children and sending New Year's gifts to the elderly is considered "human nature," and others cannot say much about it. Leaders also generally do not refuse to accept them. This can be considered a good opportunity and clever method for giving gifts.

Similar "opportunities" and "clever methods" include housewarming ceremonies, birthday celebrations, congratulations on the birth of a child, and condolences for the deceased, and so on. Now, there are some leading cadres whose homes, during weddings, funerals, and celebrations, are always grandly decorated. Among their subordinates, there are always people who take the lead in sending gifts. As a result, more and more people send gifts, and the gifts become heavier and heavier, from tens of yuan to hundreds of yuan, from bedsheets and blankets to bicycles, washing machines, and even color televisions and refrigerators. Moreover, those who send heavier gifts often do so at the expense of the state or collective. In the end, those who benefit are the gift receivers and givers, while the state and the people's interests are harmed.

The good or bad social customs are of concern to all. The Party Central Committee has made great efforts to start with party discipline, but why has there been no fundamental improvement? Observing the various performances of gift givers and receivers in society, I believe that the fundamental reason lies in the lack of effective constraints and supervision over the power of leaders and those in authority. Most leading cadres are party members. Although the Party Constitution and the "Regulations" have clear provisions on related issues, unfortunately, these provisions have not been implemented in many places. Like the aforementioned people who use various means to extensively collect and send gifts, how many have been investigated and punished? Due to the lack of effective constraints and supervision measures, those who are accustomed to engaging in unhealthy practices use their power as a tool to gain "benefits": as long as you give me "benefits," I can "flexibly" handle things that cannot be handled; if you "don't give an inch," I will block things that can be handled. Once power is used by some people for personal gain, the winds of gift-giving, bribery, and accepting gifts will inevitably arise and spread.

Now, we advocate for the openness of government affairs and increasing the transparency of party and government affairs. These methods are indeed a good way to constrain and prevent power from degenerating into private property, and to eliminate and correct unhealthy practices. However, a problem worth noting at present is that we should not turn openness into formalism. Such transparency is only superficial, and behind it, there is still a lot of murkiness, and unhealthy practices will still emerge.

### 从“压岁钱”说到风气

　　从“压岁钱”说到风气
    江苏射阳县委  杜渺
    春节听到一件有趣的事，一位企业负责人到上级领导人家中拜年，给了领导人家的小宝贝１００元压岁钱。孩子拿了１００元大票子就要上街买气球，孩子的妈妈赶忙将小宝贝拉进房间里，掏出１元钱要换那张大票子，小宝贝不肯给，并振振有词地说：“人家叔叔是给我的嘛！”孩子的妈妈将眼一瞪说：“给你的？别的叔叔为什么不给你这么多压岁钱？还不是因为你爸爸是他的上级领导！你懂吗？快给我！”
    孩子尚小，怎么能懂得人际间这么复杂微妙的关系呢？
    据笔者耳闻目睹，今年春节期间，给上级、给有权人的小孩送“压岁钱”，或给他们的老人送年礼的，不是个别现象。这恐怕是风气不正的一个新动向。正如上面那位夫人所一语道破的，这些人送“压岁钱”也好，送年礼也好，只不过是借题发挥、趁机取悦领导人或有权人而已。不是吗？现在强调要廉洁，反对送礼行贿，平时给领导人送东西总不是那么“光明正大”。而过年给小孩“压岁钱”和给老人送年礼，却是“人之常情”，别人不好讲什么，领导人多半也不会拒收。这堪称是送礼的“良机”和“妙法”。
    与此类似的“良机”、“妙法”还有砌屋上梁、生日祝寿、生孩道喜、死人吊唁，等等。现在就有那么一些领导干部家里逢婚丧喜庆必大操大办，其下属中也总有人领头前去送礼。结果一个看一个，一个比一个，送礼的人越来越多，礼送得也越来越重，从几十元到几百元，从被面、毛毯到自行车、洗衣机，甚至彩电、电冰箱。而且礼送得重的，往往是慷国家或集体之慨。到头来，得利的是收礼者和送礼者，受损害的则是国家和人民的利益。
    社会风气好坏为世人所瞩目，党中央下了很大决心从党风抓起，可为何迟迟得不到根本好转？纵观社会上送礼者和收礼者的种种表演，我以为，根本的原因还在于缺少对领导者和有权人的权力实行有效的制约和监督。领导干部绝大多数是党员，虽然党章和《准则》中对有关问题有明确规定，可惜这些规定在不少地方并未得到落实。像上面所说的变着法子大肆收礼、送礼的人，有多少受到了追究和处理？由于缺少有效的制约和监督措施，那些惯于搞不正之风的掌权者便将权力变成了捞取“实惠”的法宝：只要你给我“实惠”，不能办的事也可“变通”给你办；你若“一毛不拔”，明明可以办的事也要卡着不给你办。权力被某些人用来谋私之后，送礼行贿、收礼受贿之风也就应运而生、蔓延泛滥起来。
    如今提倡办事公开化，提高党务、政务的透明度，这些方法不失为制约和防止权力蜕变为私有，杜绝和纠正不正之风的一个好办法。但目前值得注意的一个问题是，不要将公开化变成形式主义，那样的透明度只是表面的，在其背后仍是一片混浊，歪风邪气依然会产生出来。
