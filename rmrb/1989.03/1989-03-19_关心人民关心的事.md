National People's Congress (NPC) deputies bear the trust of the entire nation, actively fulfilling their duties as representatives. In many places across China, one can see the footprints they have left behind.

Last summer, many farmers in the Jianghan Plain of Hubei Province reported to NPC deputy Gong Wenxiang that agricultural chemicals, fertilizers, and seeds were being adulterated and counterfeited, causing significant harm to the farmers, who were deeply concerned. After conducting on-site investigations, Gong Wenxiang discovered serious issues such as mixing waste salt with dye to pass off as potassium fertilizer, diluting pesticides with champagne to sell as agricultural chemicals at high prices, and counterfeiting rice seeds, resulting in only half of the rice grains sprouting. He then wrote letters to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman Wan Li to report the situation, and also wrote to the local people's congress to demand that the government take serious action. Later, the government punished the relevant departments and individuals involved.

Some NPC deputies from Guangdong Province, during a visit to the Guangzhou Fire Research Institute, noticed that the institute's equipment was outdated. The entire institute had only one graduate from the 1960s, who held the title of assistant engineer. This individual had developed fire-resistant building materials whose fireproofing performance exceeded that of similar products imported from some developed countries. The deputies reported this situation to the government, which immediately instructed the relevant departments to address the institute's funding and the technical staff's title issues.

Deputies He Xu and Zhu Shibao from Shaanxi Province played a significant role in seriously addressing gambling. Based on public feedback, they suggested that relevant authorities investigate gambling issues at the Xi'an Grand Theater, Zhiyuan Restaurant, and Shaanxi Hotel. After the Shaanxi Provincial Government conducted an investigation, more than 20 individuals involved in gambling were given serious punishments. Additionally, the provincial-level bureau of administrative affairs strengthened internal security management.

In Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, the local court did not promptly and seriously handle the traffic accident case involving Shi Zhenping, which resulted in death. Local residents had many complaints. NPC deputy Zhong Jin-gen promptly conveyed the public's opinions and demands, criticizing the relevant state organs. After a review by the Fuzhou Intermediate People's Court, Shi Zhenping was finally sentenced to two years in prison in accordance with the law. Local residents commented that Zhong Jin-gen is a representative who works for the people.

　　关心人民关心的事
    段存章　韩培梅
    全国人大代表肩负着全国人民的重托，积极执行代表职务，在我国许多地方可以看到他们留下的足迹。
    去年夏天，湖北省地处江汉平原的许多农民，纷纷向全国人大代表龚文祥反映，农药、化肥和种子被掺杂使假，农民身受其害，非常忧虑。龚文祥经过实地调查，发现确有将废盐渣配上颜料当钾肥，杀虫剂兑香槟酒当农药高价出售，稻种使假，稻谷只有一半出穗的严重问题。于是，他一面写信向全国人大常委会和万里委员长反映，一方面写信给当地人大常委会，要求督促政府严肃处理。后来，政府对有关部门及当事人进行了惩处。
    广东一些全国人大代表，视察广州消防研究所时，看到该所设备简陋，全所只有１名六十年代的大学毕业生，职称还是助理工程师。他研制的防火阻燃建筑材料，其防火性能超过我国从一些发达国家进口的这类产品。代表们向政府反映了这一情况，政府立即责成有关部门解决了消防研究所的经费和技术人员的职称问题。
    陕西代表何旭、朱世宝对严肃处理赌博立了一功。他俩根据群众的反映，建议有关机关查处西安人民大厦、止园饭店、陕西宾馆的赌博问题。经陕西省人民政府查处，对参加赌博的２０多人，分别作了严肃处理，同时在省级机关事务管理局加强了内部治安管理。
    江西省金溪县法院，对石镇平交通肇事致人死亡一案，开始没有及时、郑重予以处理，当地人民群众意见纷纷。全国人大代表钟金根及时反映人民群众的意见和要求，向有关国家机关提出批评。后经抚州中级人民法院复查，终于依法办事，将石镇平判刑二年。当地人民群众反映，钟金根是为人民办事的代表。
