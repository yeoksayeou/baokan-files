Fujian Provides Guarantees for Foreign Investment

	“Three Types of Enterprises” Not to Be Stopped or Delayed; Signed Contracts Must Be Fulfilled
	Provincial People’s Congress Establishes Taiwan Law Research Center to Improve Relevant Laws

	BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) — Reporters Zhang Rongzhou and Wang Xingzeng of Xinhua News Agency and People’s Daily reported: Since September of last year, Fujian Province has been implementing rectification and adjustment, but the momentum of foreign investment has not diminished. In 1988, 813 contracts were signed with foreign investors, with a total investment of $450 million. Among these, 180-plus projects were approved for Taiwanese investment, with an investment amount of $182 million. Both figures saw significant increases compared to the previous year. This was revealed by Fujian Province Governor Wang Zhaoguo at a meeting of the Fujian delegation to the National People’s Congress.

	Wang Zhaoguo said that some people are concerned that rectification and adjustment will affect the development of the outward-looking economy. In response, the provincial government has clearly stipulated three points: first, not to stop or delay the construction of foreign-invested, joint-venture, and cooperative enterprises; second, all contracts signed with foreign investors must be fulfilled; third, to welcome foreign investors to negotiate and establish joint-venture enterprises, especially to welcome the establishment of wholly foreign-owned enterprises and the transformation of existing old enterprises.

	This governor said that the State Council has agreed to designate a special area in Fujian for investment by Taiwanese compatriots; it is possible to establish bonded zones and bonded warehouses, and to carry out integrated development in coastal cities. He expressed that Taiwanese businessmen are welcome to invest in any part of Fujian, and that a good environment will be created for them.

	It is reported that to make foreign investors feel more secure when investing in Fujian, the Provincial People’s Congress has established a Taiwan Law Research Center to solve many legal problems that arise in the development of cross-strait exchanges. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress has agreed that Fujian Provincial People’s Congress can take the lead in drafting relevant regulations. The Chairman of the Provincial People’s Congress Standing Committee, Cheng Shu, said that to formulate good regulations, close cooperation will be strengthened with special economic zones such as Shenzhen and Zhuhai, and various regulations will be improved in a practical and feasible manner.

	It is introduced that in addition to the Xiamen Special Economic Zone, the Mawei Economic Development Zone, and the coastal open city of Fuzhou, Fujian currently has 33 open counties and cities. Last year, the State Council also designated Fujian as a pilot area for China’s reform and opening up, approving 11 measures for Fujian to expand its opening up and deepen its reforms. So far, the province has introduced more than 2,000 projects, with actual foreign investment of $950 million.

　　福建为外商投资提供保证        
    “三资”企业不停缓建所签合同必须履约        
    省人大成立台湾法研究中心完善有关法律
    本报北京３月２４日讯  中新社记者张荣洲、本报记者王行增报道：福建省自去年９月实行治理整顿以来，外商投资势头不减。１９８８年，与外商签订合同８１３项，外商投资总额４．５亿美元。其中批准台商投资项目１８０多个，投资额１．８２亿美元。都比上年有大幅增加。这是福建省省长王兆国在人大福建代表团联组会上透露的。
    王兆国说，有些人担心治理整顿会影响外向型经济发展，对此，省政府明确规定三条：一是不停建、缓建外商独资、合资、合作企业；二是凡与外商签订的合同，必须履约；三是欢迎外商来洽办合资企业，尤其欢迎兴办独资企业及改造现有老企业。
    这位省长说，国务院已同意福建划出专门地区为台湾同胞投资区；可以设保税区、保税仓库，可以在沿海城市搞联片开发。他表示，台湾商人愿在福建什么地方投资都欢迎，并为他们创造良好环境。
    据透露，为使外商到福建投资更有安全感，省人大成立了台湾法研究中心，以解决两岸交往发展中出现的许多法律问题。全国人大常委会已同意福建省人大先行一步，研拟有关法规。省人大常委会主任程序说，为制定好法规，将与深圳、珠海等特区加强联系，密切配合协作完善各项法规，使之更为切实可行。
    据介绍，福建目前除厦门特区、马尾经济开发区和沿海开放１４个城市之一的福州外，还有３３个开放县市。去年国务院还确定福建作为中国改革开放实验区，批准福建扩大开放、深化改革的１１条措施。到目前为止，全省已引进２０００余个项目，实际用外资９．５亿美元。
