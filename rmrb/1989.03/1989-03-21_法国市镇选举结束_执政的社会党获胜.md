The second round of voting in the French municipal elections took place yesterday, resulting in a clear victory for the ruling Socialist Party. Prime Minister Michel Rocard expressed his joy on television, stating that this was a "broad victory" for the Socialist Party.

After several months of intense competition, compared to the 1983 municipal elections, the number of cities controlled by the Socialist Party increased from 66 to 78, nearly reclaiming all the cities lost to the right-wing in 1983. Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac secured all 20 districts of Paris, once again being elected as the mayor of Paris. The traditional right-wing gained a few cities from the Republican Party and the Socialist Party, but overall, they lost more. The far-right National Front also secured seats in some cities.

Commentators believe that the Socialist Party government's policy of opening up to the center and its alliance with the French Communist Party during the elections were the main reasons for its victory. Additionally, the emerging ecological protection organizations, which had risen during this election, cast their votes for the Socialist Party in the second round.

French municipal elections are held every six years to elect municipal commissioners for over 36,000 municipalities nationwide, who then form municipal committees and elect mayors.

　　法国市镇选举结束        
    执政的社会党获胜
    本报巴黎３月２０日电  记者张启华报道：法国市镇选举昨天举行第二轮投票，执政的社会党取得明显的胜利。罗卡尔总理在电视中欣喜地说，这是社会党“广泛的胜利”。
    经过几个月的激烈争夺，同１９８３年市镇选举比较，社会党占领的城市由６６个增加到７８个，几乎夺回了１９８３年被右派夺去的城市。戴高乐派的希拉克囊括了巴黎市全部２０个区，再次当选巴黎市长。传统右翼从法共和社会党手里夺得几个城市，但总的看，失去的更多。极右组织国民阵线在一些城市也被选进议会。
    时事评论界认为，社会党政府奉行向中间派开放的政策，以及在选举中与法共结成联盟是获胜的主要原因。此外，在这次选举中崛起的生态保护组织在第二轮投票时，投了社会党的票。
    法国市镇选举每６年举行一次，选出全国３．６万多个市镇的市政委员，进而组成市政委员会和推选市长。
