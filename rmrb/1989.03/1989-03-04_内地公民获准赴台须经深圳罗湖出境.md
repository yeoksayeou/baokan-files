It has been learned from relevant departments that mainland citizens who are approved to visit Taiwan for reasons such as visiting relatives, seeing a sick person, attending a funeral, or other matters must exit through the Shenzhen Luohu border crossing and travel to Taiwan via Hong Kong.

To facilitate the service for mainland citizens visiting Taiwan, the Shenzhen Port China Travel Service has recently established a Mainland Citizens to Taiwan Business Department. This department specializes in handling the purchase of Hong Kong round-trip tickets to Taiwan for mainland citizens, assisting with relevant procedures, arranging accommodations, booking return tickets to the mainland, and resolving difficulties.
