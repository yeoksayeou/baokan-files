On June 20, 1988, Wang Lequan, the Secretary of the Liaocheng Regional Committee of Shandong Province, delivered a report on clean governance at a meeting attended by 1,500 party and government officials in the region. He announced that the region's anti-corruption efforts would first target the widespread issues of extravagant banquets, misuse of public vehicles, and the use of public funds for gift-giving.

However, the anti-corruption campaign initially excluded factories and enterprises.

A few days later, several factory directors and managers approached Secretary Wang Lequan. They asked, "Why does the regional committee only require clean governance in party and government agencies, while exempting our factories and enterprises?"

The response was, "We are an economically underdeveloped region. In the current environment, we fear that implementing anti-corruption measures might restrict the operations of enterprises, so we have left some leeway for them."

The factory directors and managers understood the regional committee's intentions but pointed out that if enterprises were exempt from anti-corruption efforts, government departments responsible for overseeing people, resources, and enterprises might use this as an excuse to impose burdens on enterprises. The managers' concerns were not unfounded. Some departments, seeing the loophole for enterprises, used the pretext of economic exchanges to demand meals, gifts, and favors from enterprises. For example, during a meeting at a restaurant owned by the regional construction company, guests from various departments, including commerce and taxation, attended, and even officials from the regional committee's party committee were present.

Recognizing the potential issues, the regional committee supplemented its anti-corruption regulations, declaring that enterprises were not exempt and must also maintain integrity.

Initially, some people said that such measures would scare away "wealth creators." Others argued that without the practice of entertaining and gift-giving, business would be difficult to conduct.

Eight months have passed. What is the outcome?

Lü Mianji, the director of Liaocheng Cotton Textile Mill, told reporters that he secured a significant deal in Shanghai without any gifts or entertainment. The mill's profits and taxes last year amounted to over 700 million yuan, doubling the previous year's figures, achieved through technological upgrades, new product development, and improved product quality.

Statistics show that in the second half of last year, the "activity funds" of enterprises in Liaocheng region decreased by more than 75% compared to the same period the previous year.

The practice in Liaocheng region demonstrates that if enterprises are not governed, party and government agencies cannot be effectively managed either. This is because party and government departments oversee both people and resources within enterprises.

Wang Lequan remarked, "In anti-corruption efforts, we cannot emphasize special circumstances for any sector. Everyone, from top to bottom and left to right, must participate. If we leave any 'special zones,' it will be difficult to establish a new order for socialist commodity economy."

　　廉政不能留“特区”
    新华社记者  张百新  尹建华  王进业
    １９８８年６月２０日，山东省聊城地委书记王乐泉在全区１５００名党政干部大会上作关于为政清廉的报告，公布聊城地区廉政建设首先从群众反映强烈的吃喝风、滥用公车风和用公款送礼风入手。
    然而以刹“三风”为发端的廉政建设，却把厂矿企业排斥在外。
    几天后，一些厂长、经理纷纷来找王乐泉书记。问：“地委为什么只让党政机关廉洁从政，而把我们厂矿企业例外？”
    答：“我们是经济欠发达地区，在大气候还没优化的情况下，担心一搞廉政建设，会束缚企业的手脚，所以对企业留有余地。”
    厂长、经理们既理解地委的用心，但同时指出，企业成了不搞廉政建设的“特区”，那些管人、管物、管企业的党政部门会以此为借口吃到我们头上，把负担转嫁到企业身上。厂长们担心并不是多余的。一些部门见企业留有口子，便打着经济交往的幌子到企业吃喝拿要。地区建筑公司的一个饭店开会，前来“祝贺”的有工商、税务等等，就连地委机关党委的干部也成为座上宾。
    “风起于青萍之末”。鉴于此，地委便对廉政建设作了补充规定，宣布企业也不例外，同样要保持廉洁。
    开始有人说，这么一搞会吓跑了“财神”。还有的说，“生意经”少了请客送礼这一页就难念了。
    ８个月过去了，事实如何呢？
    聊城棉纺织厂厂长吕绵基告诉记者，他空着手到大上海谈生意，回来带回一笔“两头在外”的大买卖。棉纺厂去年利税７００多万元，比上年翻一番，不是靠请客送礼，是靠技术改造，开发新产品和提高产品质量。
    据统计，去年下半年聊城地区企业“活动经费”比上年同期减少了７５％以上。
    聊城地区的实践说明，管不住企业，就管不住党政机关。因为党政部门既管企业的人，又管财物。
    王乐泉同志十分感慨地说：“搞廉政建设，不能强调哪个方面特殊，要上下左右齐动手，一留‘特区’，社会主义商品经济新秩序就难以建立。
