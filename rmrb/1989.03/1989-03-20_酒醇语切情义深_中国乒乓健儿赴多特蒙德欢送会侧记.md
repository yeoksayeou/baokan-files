Cup after cup of fine wine, wishing the athletes a victorious return.
Heartfelt words expressing concern, anticipation, and understanding.

Not long ago, the Beijing Western Suburbs Olympic Hotel, which had just hosted the 100-plus officials and security personnel of the U.S. President Bush's advance team and won praise, opened its warm arms on the evening of March 18 to welcome the Chinese table tennis athletes heading to Dortmund for the 40th World Table Tennis Championships.

During the closed training period in Huangshi, Hubei, the Huangshi Municipal Government and the Hubei Provincial Government had each held a farewell banquet for the Chinese table tennis team, both with a slightly "heroic" atmosphere. This farewell party, organized by the Hong Kong Table Tennis Association and the Olympic Hotel, made people feel even more intimate and warm.

In his farewell message to the table tennis athletes, "Put down your burdens, travel light, strive for victory, and fight for excellence," Wu Shaozu, the director of the State Sports Commission, especially emphasized the need to "fight" for excellence. He humorously quoted lyrics from "The Red Lantern" to express his hope that the athletes, as they leave their motherland to compete, would be "brave and fearless."

Li Guangzu, representing the Hong Kong Table Tennis Association, expressed his complex emotions through a song he composed and performed himself. Although he never quite managed to synchronize with the accompaniment, singing a mix of A, B, C, and D tunes, everyone in the venue felt his sincere emotions and heartfelt wishes, and saw the tears in his eyes.

Xu Yan Sheng, known as the "clever star," also abandoned his official tone, saying that Hong Kong people can sing, and he can sing Peking opera. He then sang a familiar segment in a high, clear voice, earning applause from the entire audience.

Sports competitions cannot lack winners and losers, as Xu Shao Fa coach said: "The Olympic Hotel is a joint venture, and the suits we wear are produced by a joint venture factory. But in this competition, we must not 'joint venture' in our pursuit of victory; we must win alone!" However, in this lively and humorous atmosphere, the table tennis athletes seemed to have forgotten the victory-or-defeat issue that they usually dreaded and that had been bothering them all along.

The journalists present felt a stark contrast between the atmosphere and format of this event and the "gunpowder" tension before the Seoul Olympics. They also wondered what awaited the table tennis athletes if their performance was not ideal.

Despite the uncertain outcome of the upcoming competition, the five gold medals from the Olympics had made people inside and outside the sports circle seriously consider the true meaning of sports.

An experienced "old soldier" thought more deeply. He specially came to the journalists' table and quietly said, "Friends, please take care of us whether we win or lose." His concern was justified, as the image of the loser after the Olympics was unforgettable. Changes in the system and mindset were indeed much harder than changes in form.

The relaxed and joyful environment did not make the table tennis athletes forget their mission. Someone summed up their determination using the coincidence of two names present: one was the general manager of the hotel, Sun Bishi, and the other was the vice-president of the Hong Kong Table Tennis Association, Li Guangzu.

As the last cup of wine was raised, people hoped that their wishes would come true, and the athletes hoped for the understanding and support of the people.

### 酒醇语切情义深——中国乒乓健儿赴多特蒙德欢送会侧记

　　酒醇语切情义深
    ——中国乒乓健儿赴多特蒙德欢送会侧记
    一杯杯甘醇的美酒，祝愿着健儿们凯旋。
    一句句发自肺腑的话语表达着人们的关心、期待和理解。
    ……
    前不久刚刚接待过美国总统布什访华先遣团１００余名官员和保安人员，并赢得赞誉的北京西郊奥林匹克饭店，１８日晚又张开热情的双臂，欢迎即将赴多特蒙德参加第４０届世乒赛的中国乒乓健儿。
    中国乒乓球代表团在湖北黄石进行封闭式训练期间，黄石市府、湖北省府曾分别为他们“壮行”。这两次略带“悲壮”色彩的酒会，使这次由香港乒乓总会和奥林匹克饭店举行的欢送会更使人感到亲切和温暖。
    国家体委主任伍绍祖在送给乒乓健儿“放下包袱、轻装前进、奋勇拚搏、杀出水平”的临别赠言中，特别强调了要“杀”出水平。他风趣地引用了《红灯记》中的唱词，希望运动员们离别母亲祖国赴赛，一定要“浑身是胆雄赳赳”。
    香港乒乓球总会代表李光祖以自编自演的歌曲表达自己复杂的心情。尽管他始终没有与伴奏音乐合上拍，唱得是ＡＢＣＤ“多调混合曲”，但是会场上所有的人都感觉到了他真挚的感情和衷心的祝愿，也都看到了他满眶的泪水。
    曾有“智多星”绰号的徐寅生也一改“官腔”，称香港人能唱歌，他也能唱京剧。随后他便以高亢清亮的京腔，取人们熟悉的一段小唱，赢得满场喝采。
    体育比赛不能没有胜负，正如许绍发教练讲的：“奥林匹克饭店是合资的，我们穿的西服是合资厂生产的。但在这次比赛中，我们争夺胜利不能‘合资’，要独拿！”然而，在这欢闹、诙谐的气氛中，乒乓健儿们似乎忘记了平时最忌讳而又一直困扰着他们的胜负问题。
    在座的新闻界人士从会场的气氛和形式中，感到了与汉城奥运会前“火药味”甚浓的强烈反差，也预感到一旦战绩不理想，等待着乒乓健儿的会是什么？
    尽管此去胜负难卜，奥运会的５枚金牌使体育圈内圈外的人都在认真地思考体育的真正涵义。
    一位身经百战的“老将”想得更深，他专程来到记者们的桌前，悄悄说：“朋友们，打好打坏都请多关照。”他的忧虑不无道理，奥运会后失败者的形象令人难忘。体制上、观念上的改变的确比形式上的改变要难得多。
    宽松、欢乐的环境并没有使乒乓健儿忘记自己的使命。有人用在场两个人的名字的巧合概括了他们的决心：一个是饭店董事总经理孙必胜，一个是香港乒总副会长李光祖。
    当举起最后一杯酒时，人们希望祝愿成为事实，健儿们希望人们的理解和支持。
