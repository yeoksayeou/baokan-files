The People's Daily reports from Beijing, March 5: Reporter Wang Yougong learned from the ongoing Fourth Plenary Session of the Third National Congress of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology that, according to incomplete statistics from 36 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and cities with independent planning status, over the past three years, various levels of technical consulting services organized by the science and technology associations have helped 48,000 medium and small enterprises and township enterprises increase their output value by over 13 billion yuan, increase profits and taxes by 3.3 billion yuan, save 2.9 billion yuan in funds, and earn 200 million US dollars in foreign exchange from exports.

Under the leadership of Zhang Wei, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, more than 300 experts have been invited to conduct research on "China's Transportation Development Strategy and Policy Research," and have submitted four consulting suggestions to the State Council and relevant departments. The China Energy Research Society organized over 500 experts to discuss and draft the "Suggested Outline for China's Energy Policy," proposing a strategic approach that emphasizes both development and conservation.

These efforts have played an important role in promoting China's scientific and technological development and economic construction. For this reason, the governments of provinces such as Hunan and Fujian have decided that major projects of various departments must undergo evaluation and review by relevant experts from the science and technology associations before they can proceed.

    本报北京３月５日讯  记者王友恭从正在此间召开的中国科协三届四次全委会议上获悉：据３６个省、市、自治区和计划单列市的不完全统计，近３年来，由科协系统组织的各层次的技术咨询服务活动，已使４．８万个中小企业和乡镇企业增加产值１３０多亿元，增加利税３３亿元，节约资金２９亿元，出口创汇２亿美元。
    在中国科协副主席张维主持下，先后邀请３００多位专家开展的“中国交通运输发展战略与政策研究”，已向国务院和有关部门提出４个咨询建议。中国能源研究会组织５００多位专家，讨论拟定“中国能源政策纲要建议”，提出了开发与节能并重的战略思想。
    这些工作在促进我国科技发展和经济建设中产生了重要的作用。为此，湖南、福建等省政府作出决定：各部门的重大项目，必须经过科协组织有关专家评估论证才能上马。
