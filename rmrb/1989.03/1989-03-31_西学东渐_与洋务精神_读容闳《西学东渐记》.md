The "Western Learning Eastward Spread" and the Spirit of Self-Strengthening

—Reading Yung Wing's "My Life in China and America"

In the mid-19th century, the cannon fire of the Opium War shattered the self-delusion of the imperial court. Those foreign "barbarians" who had previously been regarded as subjects suddenly became formidable; the Chinese people exclaimed that the foreigners' ships and guns were superior, and that they could not be defeated. Thus, some people began to engage in self-strengthening. They seemed to believe that China was good in every way, except for a few advanced machines and weapons. Once these were obtained, the dynasty could be preserved, and the imperial might could be restored. They rarely considered: gunpowder was originally a Chinese invention, so why did the foreigners have guns and cannons first? The great ships of Admiral Zheng He were once so magnificent, but now they were helpless against the foreign fleets.

A young man on the other side of the Pacific, Yung Wing, thought more deeply. Eight years of life abroad made this earliest American-educated Chinese realize that the so-called "Celestial Empire" was merely a "purely old world." He ignored the gloomy and dangerous prospects, carried his Yale University diploma, and resolutely returned to China, determined to "introduce Western learning to China, making it gradually civilized and strong." Yung Wing devoted his life to the cause of the "Western Learning Eastward Spread." It can be said that he always spoke of the West, but what he praised was not how rich or noble the Westerners were, but the methods of wealth and strength and the spirit of civilization in the West. In the West, students could defy their teachers' wishes and still be understood, women could study and work like men, children's wild imaginations were encouraged, and scholars and gentlemen were eager to help other countries become rich and strong... These ordinary life phenomena, though mundane, were closely related to the West's wealth and strength. In Yung Wing's mind, what he called Western learning was not just a few mathematical equations and manufacturing techniques. Behind the strong ships and powerful guns lay a different humanistic spirit and way of life, and it was these things that were the essence of wealth and strength. Similarly, in Yung Wing's view, promoting Western learning was not just about reading a few foreign books, buying a few foreign machines, or learning a bit of installation and operation technology from foreigners. More importantly, it was about instilling the modern civilized spirit of the West into the Chinese people, and the best way to obtain this spirit was to let people practice it in the living environment where it thrived. It was precisely with this understanding that Yung Wing endured humiliation and strongly advocated for the education of children abroad, considering this move as the "hope for China's revival."

People often easily regard the "Western Learning Eastward Spread" movement advocated by Yung Wing as a part of the Self-Strengthening Movement. In fact, the two have significant differences in their purposes. The Self-Strengthening Movement took the slogan "Chinese learning as the essence, Western learning as the application" as its guideline, aiming to use Western advanced science and technology to maintain China's existing social and ideological forms. Yung Wing certainly also wanted to promote Western science and technology in China, but his deeper intention was to use the new civilized spirit to inspire the Chinese people and create a "new era." Therefore, the so-called "Western Learning Eastward Spread" was actually an enlightenment movement in China's special environment, whose purpose was exactly the opposite of the spirit of self-strengthening, aiming to awaken the Chinese people to reform the old social system and cultural system. Yung Wing once earnestly advised the leader of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom on seven proposals for building a new government and expressed his willingness to serve as a vanguard for implementing the new policies; seeing that the American-educated children had shed the "heavy pressure on their spiritual freedom in the past," and their "speech and thoughts were completely different from traditional education," Yung Wing felt genuinely pleased... All of this can illustrate the deep meaning of the "Western Learning Eastward Spread." The spirit of self-strengthening contains an irreconcilable internal contradiction: to make "Western learning as the application," "Chinese learning" would be difficult to maintain as the "essence"; to maintain "Chinese learning as the essence," "Western learning" would be difficult to use as the "application." Yung Wing seemed to have seen this long ago. Once the obedient queue-wearing subjects arrived in America, they no longer followed the old ways, and the new life and culture created a group of useful scientific and technological talents, while also creating a group of rebels against autocracy. They all believed that "Eastern and Western cultures are as different as heaven and earth," and that fundamental changes in China were urgent. This idea was deeply ingrained, and no matter how much they experienced, they could not forget it. What Yung Wing expected from the Chinese people was precisely this profound spiritual change.

Yung Wing passed away more than 80 years ago, leaving behind a famous work, "My Life in China and America" (included in the "Towards the World" series by Yuelu Publishing House). This century, China's society and culture have undergone tremendous changes, and the influence of the "Western Learning Eastward Spread" and the overseas study movement advocated by Yung Wing in this historical process is not difficult to assess. Modern China is far from what it used to be, but reviewing Yung Wing's words and deeds can still provide profound enlightenment.

### “西学东渐”与洋务精神——读容闳《西学东渐记》

　　“西学东渐”与洋务精神        
    ——读容闳《西学东渐记》
    １９世纪中叶，鸦片战争的炮声打破了天朝君臣自我陶醉的迷梦。那些异域“番邦”的舶来者以前被人视之为臣，是时却威风陡长；国人惊呼洋人船坚炮利，不可与战。于是有人开始操办洋务。他们似乎觉得，中国什么都好，就是少了几样先进的机械和武器，一旦有了这些东西，就能江山不改，天威如昔。他们很少去想：火药本是中国的土特产，何以会先有洋枪洋炮？昔日三保太监的艨艟巨舰是何等的威风，如今自己何以会反被洋人的舰队弄得手足无措？
    远在大洋彼岸的年轻人容闳想得多些。８年的异国生活使这位最早的留美生认识到，所谓的中华上邦不过是一个“纯粹的旧世界”。他无视阴郁险恶的前景，怀揣耶鲁大学的毕业文凭毅然扶桑东渡，立志“以西方之学术灌输于中国，使中国日趋文明富强之境”。容闳毕生致力于“西学东渐”之事业，可以说是言必称西方，但他所称道的决不是西方人如何如何富有，如何如何高贵，而是西方的富强之术和文明精神。在西方，学生违背恩师的意愿可以得到人们的理解，女人也能像男人那样钻研学术和致力公务，孩子们异想天开受到嘉许，为异邦人谋求富强而热心奔走的学者绅士亦不乏其人……如此种种生活现象虽然平凡，却与西方的富强有着极为密切的联系。在容闳的心目中，所谓西学决不仅仅是一些算学方程和制造工艺，坚船利炮背后隐藏着某种迥然不同的人文精神和生活方式，只有这些东西才是富强之本。同样，在容闳看来，推行西学也不仅仅是要人读几本洋书，买几台洋机器或跟外国人学一点安装操作技术，更重要的是要向国人灌输西方的现代文明精神，而要求得这种精神，最好的办法莫过于让人们到它赖以生长的生活背景下去身体力行。正是鉴于这样的理解，容闳忍辱负重，力倡稚童留洋，并视此举为“中国复兴希望之所系”。
    人们很容易将容闳所倡导的“西学东渐”运动看成是洋务运动的一个组成部分，其实二者的宗旨有着极大的区别。洋务运动以“中学为体、西学为用”这一口号为纲领，旨在利用西方先进的科学技术来维护中国既有的社会形态和意识形态。容闳固然也想在中国推广西方的科学技术，但更深的用意却在于以新的文明精神来启发国人，创造一种“新时势”。因此，所谓“西学东渐”实际上是在中国特殊环境之下的一场启蒙运动，其目的恰好与洋务精神相悖，是为了唤起国人去改造旧的社会制度体系和思想文化体系。容闳曾向太平天国领袖恳陈建设新政的七项建议，并表示甘愿为推行新政充当马前卒；看到留美稚童尽释“昔日灵性上所受极重之压力”，“言论思想，悉与旧教育不侔”，容闳由衷地感到欣慰……这一切都可以说明“西学东渐”的深意。洋务精神中包含着不可调和的内在矛盾：要想“西学为用”，“中学”就难以“为体”；要想“中学为体”，“西学”就难以“为用”。容闳似乎早就看到了这一点。昔日唯唯诺诺的小辫民一到美国便不复安行矩步，新的生活、新的文化造就了一批有用的科技人才，同时也造就了一批专制主义的叛逆者，他们“人人心中，咸谓东西文化判若天渊，而于中国根本上的变革，认为不容稍缓之事。此种观念，深入脑筋，无论身经若何变迁，皆不能或忘也”。容闳所期待于国人的正是这种精神上的深刻变化。
    容闳辞世８０多年了，留下了一部闻名中外的《西学东渐记》（已收入岳麓书社的《走向世界》丛书）。本世纪以来，中国的社会和文化经历了巨大的变迁，容闳所倡导的“西学东渐”和出国留学运动在这一历史过程中的影响不难评估。现代的中国已远非昔日可比，但重温容闳的言论事迹，未尝不能给人以深刻的启迪。
