Foreign Exchange Trading

Q: What is foreign exchange trading? What are its forms?

A: Foreign exchange trading refers to the buying and selling of one country's currency for another country's currency at a predetermined exchange rate. It can be divided into two forms: spot foreign exchange trading and forward foreign exchange trading.

Spot foreign exchange trading, also known as cash trading, refers to foreign exchange transactions where the settlement is made on the same day or within two business days. This process of settlement is called delivery. The main purposes of spot foreign exchange trading are: first, to meet the client's temporary payment needs; second, to help clients adjust the currency composition of their foreign exchange holdings to avoid exchange rate risks.

Forward foreign exchange trading, also known as forward exchange buying and selling, refers to transactions where the bank and the client agree on a forward exchange rate to buy or sell foreign exchange for settlement on a specified future date. The settlement period is the time from the contract's establishment to the delivery date, usually one month, three months, six months, and up to one year or more.

Q: Why do many enterprises now go to banks to buy "forward" contracts?

A: Generally, the purpose of buying and selling forward foreign exchange is to avoid or reduce the potential losses caused by exchange rate fluctuations, thereby fixing import and export costs. For imports, if the currency used for payment appreciates and the currency held by the importer depreciates, to avoid the risk of future appreciation, the importer can sign a contract with the bank to buy the appreciating currency and sell the depreciating currency held.

For exports, if the currency received is likely to depreciate, the exporter should sign a contract with the bank to sell this foreign exchange and convert it into the domestic currency or a stronger foreign currency. For example, a foreign trade company exports goods worth $100,000 to the United States. At the time of the contract, the exchange rate is 1 U.S. dollar equals 130 Japanese yen, and the three-month forward exchange rate is 1 U.S. dollar equals 127 Japanese yen. To avoid the risk of the U.S. dollar depreciating, the company, at the time of the contract, sells three-month forward U.S. dollars to the Bank of China and buys three-month forward Japanese yen. Assuming that at the time of shipment and payment, the U.S. dollar falls to 1 U.S. dollar equals 125 Japanese yen, the company can still buy Japanese yen from the Bank of China at the rate of 1 U.S. dollar equals 127 Japanese yen, avoiding a loss of 200,000 Japanese yen.

Q: What kinds of foreign exchange trading can Chinese banks currently handle?

A: Due to the time difference between export collection and settlement, forward foreign exchange buying and selling for export collection is not widely practiced in China and is only conducted in pilot cities. Domestic banks can handle spot foreign exchange transactions between foreign currencies and the domestic currency, as well as between foreign currencies. However, they do not handle forward transactions involving the domestic currency. The Bank of China can handle forward transactions between foreign currencies with domestic enterprises.

　　外汇交易
    问：什么叫外汇交易？它有几种形式？
    答：外汇交易指一国货币按既定的汇率换取另一国货币的买卖，可分为即期外汇交易与远期外汇交易两种形式。
    即期外汇交易也称现汇交易，是指外汇买卖成交当天或在两个营业日内办理收付的外汇业务，办理这种收付的行为称为交割。即期外汇交易的主要目的，一是满足客户临时性付款的需要；二是帮助客户调整手中外汇头寸的货币比重，以避免汇价风险。
    远期外汇交易也称期汇买卖，是指银行与客户按照远期汇率订立契约，买入或卖出一定日期以后实行交割的外汇交易。交割期限指买卖契约成立后至交割日的期间，一般为一个月、三个月、六个月，最长也可以到一年或一年以上。
    问：现在许多企业都到银行买“远期”，这是为什么？
    答：一般说来，人们买卖远期外汇的目的，主要是避免或减少汇率变动可能造成的损失，从而固定进出口成本。就进口而言，若支付货款的货币趋升，进口企业持有的货币趋跌，为避免将来升值所带来的风险，进口企业可与银行签订一个合约，买进远期趋升的货币，卖出手中趋跌的货币。
    就出口而言，若收进的货币有可能贬值的话，出口企业就应与银行签订合约卖出这笔外汇，换成本国货币或较坚挺的其他货币。例如某外贸公司出口价值十万美元的商品到美国，签约时汇率为一美元等于一百三十日元，三个月远期汇率为一美元等于一百二十七日元。为避免美元下降的风险，该公司在订约时，向中国银行卖出三个月远期美元，买入三个月远期日元。假设在装船交货收款时，美元跌至一美元等于一百二十五日元，该公司仍可按一美元等于一百二十七日元的水平从中国银行买进日元，避免了二十万日元的损失。
    问：目前我国银行能做哪些外汇交易？
    答：由于出口收汇的时间与交割期往往发生差异，目前我国出口收汇的远期外汇买卖不甚普及，只在试点城市办理。国内能做外币与本币以及外币与外币的即期外汇交易，不做人民币的远期业务，但中国银行与国内企业之间可做外币与外币的远期业务。
