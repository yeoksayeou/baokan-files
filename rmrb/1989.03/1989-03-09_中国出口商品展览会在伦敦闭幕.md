China's Export Commodities Exhibition closed yesterday in London. During the one-week exhibition, approximately 5,000 people visited, with 90% of them being businesspeople.

This exhibition focused on practical and pioneering efforts rather than seeking fame or spectacle. The primary content was solid trade negotiations, with a total transaction amount of nearly $6 million during the exhibition period.

Among the 44 Chinese companies that participated, a significant portion were medium and small enterprises and joint ventures from inland provinces. They are eager to explore and are making their mark on the international trade stage.

British trade professionals generally believe that "the exhibition has aroused great interest in the British business community."
