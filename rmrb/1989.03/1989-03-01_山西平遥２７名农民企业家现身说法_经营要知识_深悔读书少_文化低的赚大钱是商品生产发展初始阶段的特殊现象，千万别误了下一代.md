Over the past two years, the phenomenon of students dropping out of school has been severe in China. The reasons are multifaceted, but the primary influence is the resurgence of the "studying is useless" ideology. Some parents of students see illiterate individuals becoming bosses and students who dropped out making big money through buying and selling, leading them to mistakenly believe that "engaging in commodity production does not require much knowledge." One parent asked the author, "What good does it do to graduate from university? Isn't Liu Shengwu just an elementary school graduate?"

Liu Shengwu is one of the earliest successful farmer entrepreneurs in Shanxi Province. In 1982, he took over the loss-making agricultural machinery factory in Dongguo Village, Pingyao County, and became wealthy first. Later, he led the entire village to prosperity, becoming a provincial labor model. Apart from Liu Shengwu, Pingyao County has seen the rise of several dozen farmer entrepreneurs like Chen Baokai, Pang Mingsheng, and Tian Changshou in recent years. In terms of education, 70% have an elementary school education, 20% have a junior high school education, and only a few percent have a high school diploma.

Does commodity production really not require knowledge? (To be precise, people acknowledge that education is indispensable, but they question what level of education is sufficient.) Recently, the author interviewed 27 farmer entrepreneurs in Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, and found that their success is not only related to their personal factors but also to certain social factors.

Special social conditions have allowed those with almost no knowledge to make big money, creating a temporary mismatch between knowledge and achievement during the reform period. It should be said that China's commodity production started under special social conditions. After years of political movements, especially the criticism of the "commodity production" concept, people entered the commodity production field in a state of trepidation. While most people were still entangled in the pain of "ideology" and "line" issues, and while store shelves were empty and production paths were numerous with easy access to loans (even loan quotas were distributed), these farmer entrepreneurs took the lead. Most of them have this characteristic: they are very bold and a bit "restless." In a positive light, this is called believing in policies to get rich quickly; in a less flattering way, it's called "the bold die full."

Commodity production has not yet entered or fully entered the computer age, and physical labor and manual operations are still the main forms of labor. At this stage, developing certain productions only requires one or two years of high school education. Many township enterprises are like this now, with only about 10% reaching the equipment level of general state-owned enterprises in the 1960s, while the vast majority still use semi-mechanized or manual labor, not even talking about using computers for production. It is hard to imagine how the current leaders of some township enterprises, with their limited knowledge, will adapt to a future where even installing glass and plastic parts will be guided by silicon chips and computer programs.

In fact, when people admire or imitate these farmer entrepreneurs, they only see their success and honor, fantasizing about when they can be like them, spending money freely. But who knows that they are still deeply troubled by their lack of culture!

Farmer entrepreneur and general manager of Siguang Machinery Factory, Han Shigong, told the author: "I started producing woodworking machinery in 1986. At that time, there were only three factories in Pingyao County, now there are 11. In 1986, the county produced 6,000 units annually, now just Baocheng alone produces over 10,000 units. This product is now showing signs of oversupply. To survive, converting production is a way out. But now there are many people doing business, and every field is full. Finding new production paths is much harder than a few years ago. Recently, I want to produce hydraulic oil presses. But producing this is not like woodworking machinery, the drawings and equipment are not ready-made, and it is much more complex. As an initial middle school graduate, I can't even understand the drawings. Of course, I have money now, and I'm not worried about buying other people's brains, even buying computers, but to command those 'computers,' my 'rustic brain' is not up to the task." At this moment, he couldn't help but worry about his lack of education.

The situation of Pang Mingsheng, a graduate of the "old three classes" (a group of students who missed out on education due to the Cultural Revolution), is relatively better. Since 1985, he has been the general manager of Dongcheng Machinery Factory, introducing a semi-automatic production line, which is expected to start production this year with a casting capacity of 3,500 tons, 1.5 times the current capacity, making him the only entrepreneur in Pingyao County using a production line. However, in his conversation with the author, he still expressed this wish: "It would be great to study a few more years in university. If I don't study, I will be eliminated in the future competition."

The deep sense of insufficient knowledge is not just a modest statement from these farmer entrepreneurs.

Society is advancing, and in 15 years, at most 20 years, whose era will it be? Will it be the small child workers who can barely reach the machine handle, or the small peddlers who can earn a "big yuan" a day? Neither. It will belong to those children who are diligently studying in school, they are the hope of the future era!

It is worth noting that during the investigation, the author learned that among the 27 entrepreneurs, none of their school-aged children have dropped out. Among the total of 63 school-aged children, 17 are in primary school, 18 in junior high school, 10 in senior high school, 8 in vocational school, and 2 in university. The 8 who did not get into school are all self-funding their education or attending cram schools. Can this phenomenon be considered solely from the perspective that they have money?

　　山西平遥２７名农民企业家现身说法——
    经营要知识　深悔读书少
    文化低的赚大钱是商品生产发展初始阶段的特殊现象，千万别误了下一代
    《山西日报》记者  穆哲民
    近两年来，我国中小学生辍学现象严重，原因是多方面的，但主要是新的“读书无用论”的影响。一些学生家长看到大字不识半升的人当了老板，失学的学生倒买倒卖赚了大钱，便误认为“搞商品生产无需多少知识”。一位学生家长反问笔者：“念到大学毕业能咋？人家刘生武不也是个高小毕业生吗？”
    刘生武，是山西省最早崛起的农民企业家。他于１９８２年承包了平遥县东郭村连续亏损８年的农机厂，率先富了起来，后又带领全村人一起富，成了省劳动模范。除了刘生武，平遥县这几年又先后崛起了陈宝凯、庞明生、田长寿等几十位农民企业家。论其学历，７０％是小学文化程度，２０％是初中文化程度，高中毕业生仅占到百分之几。
    商品生产真的就不需要知识了吗？（确切地说，人们承认教育是不可少的，但对究竟要达到什么标准才够用有疑问）最近笔者采访了山西省平遥县２７位农民企业家，发现他们的成功，不仅与本人的因素有关，也有着一定的社会因素。
    特殊的社会条件，使多数知识近乎空白的人赚了大钱，出现了改革过程中知识与事业的暂时的错位现象。应该说，中国的商品生产是在一种特殊的社会条件下起步的。在多年来的政治运动，特别是批判“商品生产”观念的社会条件下，人们在一种战战兢兢的精神状态下进入商品生产领域。在绝大多数人还为“主义”和“路线”问题而痛苦地纠缠着的时候，在商店货架上空空荡荡，生产门路很多、贷款又十分容易（曾经还分配过贷款指标）的时候，这些农民企业家先入为胜。他们之中，绝大多数人都有这样一个特点：胆子很大，又有那么点儿不“安分守己”。说得好听点儿，这叫做相信政策富得快；说的不中听些，叫“撑死胆大的”。
    商品生产还没有走上或完全步入电脑时代，拚体力、手工操作还是一种主要劳动形式。在这个时候发展某些生产，只需上一两年高中就够用了。现在的不少乡镇企业正是这样，只有百分之十几能达到６０年代一般国营企业的设备水平，而绝大多数还是采用半机械化或手工劳动，根本谈不上使用电脑进行生产。很难想象，现在一些乡镇企业的领导人所有的那点知识，如何能适应以后连安玻璃和塑料部件也要由硅片和电脑程序指导下进行的工作。
    其实，当人们在羡慕或模仿这些农民企业家时，只看到他们的成功、荣誉，幻想着什么时候能像他们那样，大把大把地花钱。可有谁知道，他们却还在深深地为文化的缺乏而困扰呢！
    农民企业家、四贡机械厂厂长韩士贡对笔者说：“我在１９８６年开始生产木工机床，那时平遥县全县３家，现在已发展到１１家。１９８６年全县年产６０００台，现在光保成一家就上万台，这种产品现已出现过剩趋势。要想生存下去，转产当然是条出路。但现在搞企业的人很多，行行道道都占得满满的，新的生产门路比前几年难找得多了。为了在竞争中求生存，最近我想上液压榨油机。但生产这玩意儿不比木工机床，图纸设备都不现成，并且复杂得多，咱这个初中毕业生连图纸也看不懂。当然，现在我有的是钱，不发愁用钱买来别人的脑子，甚至买电脑，但要指挥那些‘电脑’，咱这‘土脑子’就不行了。”此时，他不能不为自己文化低而伤脑筋了。
    老三届高中毕业生庞明生的情况就比较好些。他自１９８５年担任了东城机械厂厂长以来，引进了一条炉排半自动流水生产线，今年可望投产，铸造能力能达到３５００吨，为现在的１．５倍，成为全平遥县唯一使用生产线的企业家。不过，他在与笔者交谈中，还是流露出这样的愿望：“能上几年大学就好了，再不上学，在以后的竞争中就要被淘汰了。”
    深感知识不够用，绝非这些农民企业家的谦词。
    社会是向前发展的，再过１５年，至多２０年，时代将属于谁？是那些踮起脚跟才够得上机床摇柄的小童工，还是那些一天可拿到一张“大团结”的小商贩？都不是，而是属于那些在学校孜孜攻读的孩子们的，他们才是未来时代希望所在！
    在厌学思潮还在泛滥时，值得欣慰的是，笔者在调查结束时得知这样一条消息：这２７名企业家的学龄子女中，无一人辍学。在总共的６３名学龄少年儿童中，有１７名上小学、１８名上初中、１０名上高中、８名上中专，还有２名上大学。有８名没考上学校的，都已自费上学或参加补习班了。这种现象，难道仅仅能从他们有钱这个角度考虑吗？
