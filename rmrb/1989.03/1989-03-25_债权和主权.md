Title: Debt and Sovereignty

Brazil is the largest debtor nation in the Third World, and Brazil also possesses the world's largest tropical rainforest—the Amazon, which is often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth" and the "oxygen bank of humanity."

Recently, some of Brazil's creditor nations have ingeniously proposed linking debt and forestry, suggesting that the Amazon could be used as a means to pay off external debts. A U.S. Senate delegation visiting Brazil proposed that the United States could consider forgiving part of Brazil's external debt in exchange for the right to protect the Amazon rainforest. Some have even bluntly proposed establishing an "international trust area" in the Amazon.

The Brazilian government angrily rejected these "kind offers." President Sarney clearly stated, "No country can buy an inch of Brazilian land with money." In response, those creditor nations who made the suggestions seemed unperturbed, saying, "Brazil's reaction is overblown." Before criticizing Brazil, they probably didn't have time to reflect on whether their own proposal of exchanging debt for sovereignty was a bit excessive.

The call to "save the Amazon" is undoubtedly correct, but attempting to exchange "debt" for "sovereignty" and seize others' wealth under the guise of environmental protection is bound to fail. Do not forget that protecting the ecological environment is a common issue concerning the survival of all humanity. Here, there is no distinction between creditor and debtor nations. Most of the Amazon rainforest is within Brazil's borders, and the sovereignty over the forest belongs to Brazil. Those who forget these principles, do not respect the sovereignty and national sentiments of debtor nations, and, relying on the "advantage" of being a creditor nation, act arrogantly and make inappropriate demands, will only see their "rescue plans" meet with rejection and become mere illusions.

Currently, Brazil faces the enormous challenge of both protecting the forest and developing the economy. If developed countries truly care about the fate of the Amazon, they should provide Brazil with some practical economic assistance to ease Brazil's debt burden, rather than trying to play the "debt-for-forest" game.

### 债权和主权

　　债权和主权
    巴西是第三世界最大的债务国，巴西又拥有世界上最大的热带雨林——被人们称为“地球之肺”和“人类氧气库”的亚马孙森林。
    最近，巴西的一些债权国匠心独运，提出了把债权和森林相联系的“原则”，说什么可以“把亚马孙作为支付外债的一种方式”。美国一个参议员代表团访问巴西时提出，美国可以考虑减免巴西的部分外债，换得保护亚马孙森林的权力。有的更直截了当提出“在亚马孙建立国际托管区”的主张。
    巴西政府愤怒地拒绝了上述“好意”。萨尔内总统明确表示，“任何国家都不可能用钱买巴西的一寸土地”。对此，那些提出建议的债权国颇不以为然，他们说，“巴西的反应过度”。在指责巴西之前，他们大概还没有来得及反省一下，他们自己的那个用债权换主权的建议是否有点过分。
    “拯救亚马孙”的主张无疑是正确的，但是，企图拿“债权”换“主权”，借机染指别人的财富，肯定要碰壁。不要忘记，保护生态环境是有关全人类生存的共同问题，这里不分什么债权国或债务国。亚马孙森林大部分面积在巴西境内，森林的主权属于巴西。那些忘记上述原则，不尊重债务国的主权和民族感情，仗着债权国的“优势”，以“拯救者”自居的人颐指气使，提出不恰当的要求，其结果，只能使他们的那种“拯救计划”遭碰壁而成为镜花水月。
    目前，巴西面临着既要保护森林又要发展经济的巨大难题。发达国家若真正关心亚马孙的命运，最好是向巴西提供一些切实的经济帮助，减轻巴西的债务负担，而不要去打“债务换森林”的算盘。
