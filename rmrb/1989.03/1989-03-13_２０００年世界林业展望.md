Currently, the world's forests are facing two major crises: the "poverty crisis" in developing countries, which involves the destruction of tropical forests, and the "environmental crisis" in developed countries, which involves the harm caused by acid rain to temperate forests.

Over the past 20 years, developing countries have lost approximately 11.5 million hectares of tropical forests annually, accounting for about 0.6% of the total tropical forest area. However, the annual afforestation area is only 1.5 million hectares (excluding China), which is less than one-tenth of the deforested area. If the current rate of tropical forest destruction continues, by the year 2000, 11.7% of the tropical forests will be destroyed. The disappearance of forests has led to desertification and severe degradation of ecosystems.

The crisis facing tropical forests is essentially a "poverty crisis," with the core issue being the shortage of firewood. According to a 1987 prediction by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, by the year 2000, the world's wood consumption will reach 4.245 billion cubic meters, of which 2.235 billion cubic meters will be firewood. The shortage of firewood is the most fundamental challenge facing the forestry industry in developing countries.

Over the past 20 years, developed countries have increasingly prioritized the ecological and social benefits of forests, implementing supportive policies for forestry. Although large-scale logging has occurred in the past, the trend for forest resources is still upward. By the year 2000, the forest resources in developed countries will continue to show an upward trend. The Soviet Union, despite a projected increase in wood harvesting by 1.2 to 1.4 times by the end of the century, will still see an increase in forest area. In Europe, Ireland's usable forest area is growing the fastest, reaching 70%. Canada, Japan, and Australia will also see an upward trend in their forest resources. However, temperate forests are also facing the threat of acid rain.

The development trends of forest resources in these two types of countries indicate that the increase or decrease of forest resources is closely related to economic development. This must be considered when formulating forestry development strategies.

By the year 2000, due to continuous population growth, the demand for food will significantly increase, making deforestation for agriculture a particularly serious problem. Additionally, air pollution knows no borders, and the area of forests affected by air pollution will further expand. The continuous reduction of forest area will inevitably lead to more severe soil erosion. Many countries are formulating forestry development strategies suitable to their national conditions to address the "two crises" and develop forestry.

The current global trend in forestry development is shifting from traditional forestry to modern forestry, with expanding afforestation being the top priority for forestry in all countries. Since the end of World War II, the area of afforestation worldwide has been continuously expanding, and the proportion of artificial regeneration in forest renewal has been increasing. Currently, global afforestation is transitioning from purely cultivating timber forests to comprehensive multi-purpose management, but there are differences between developed and developing countries. In recent years, most temperate countries have proposed multi-purpose forest management. For example, the United States has designated a significant portion of its forests as water source forests, national forest parks, and recreational forests.

The focus of afforestation in tropical developing countries is also changing. From the 1950s to the 1970s, the focus was on cultivating timber forests. In the past decade, the focus has shifted towards protective forests, social forestry, and agroforestry. Energy forests are also a direction for afforestation development. Countries like Brazil have provided experiences in addressing the energy crisis.

The 9th World Forestry Congress called on people and governments around the world to fully recognize the importance of forests to the biosphere and human survival, and to contribute to the protection and development of forest resources. This is the direction of efforts for forestry workers in all countries.

Finland, known as the "Land of Forests," has a forest coverage rate of 75% and attracts a large number of tourists each year. The image shows a corner of a Finnish forest.

### ２０００年世界林业展望

　　２０００年世界林业展望
     关百钧
    目前，世界森林面临着两大危机：发展中国家的“贫困危机”，即热带林遭破坏；发达国家的“环境危机”，即温带林的酸雨危害。
    近２０多年来，发展中国家的热带林每年损失面积约１１５０万公顷，约占热带林面积０．６％，而每年造林面积为１５０万公顷（不包括中国），不到毁林面积的１／１０。如果目前热带林的毁林速度继续保持下去，到２０００年将有１１．７％热带林被毁掉。森林的消失导致了沙漠化和生态系统的严重恶化。
    热带林面临的危机，实质上是“贫困危机”，其表现的核心是薪材问题。据１９８７年联合国粮农组织的预测，到２０００年，世界木材消费量将为４２．４５亿立方米，其中薪材２２．３５亿立方米。薪材短缺是发展中国家林业面临的最根本的挑战。
    近２０多年来，发达国家把森林生态效益和社会效益摆在越来越重要的地位，对林业普遍采取了扶持政策。尽管过去进行过大面积采伐，但其森林资源却是上升的趋势。到２０００年，发达国家的森林资源仍将是上升的趋势。苏联尽管木材采伐量到本世纪末将增加１．２至１．４倍，但森林面积仍将增加。在欧洲，爱尔兰可利用林面积增长得最快，将达７０％。加拿大、日本和澳大利亚森林资源也将是上升趋势。但是，温带林也面临酸雨的危害。
    上述两种类型国家的森林资源发展趋势表明，森林资源的消长是与经济发展密切相关的。这在制定林业发展战略时，必须考虑到这个发展规律。
    到２０００年，由于人口不断增长，粮食需要量将大幅度增加，毁林种地则是一种特别严重的问题；又由于空气污染没有国界，森林受空气污染的面积将进一步扩大。森林面积的不断缩小，水土流失必然进一步加剧，许多国家纷纷制订适合本国国情的林业发展战略，摆脱“两危”，发展林业。
    当今世界林业发展的总趋势是从传统林业向现代化林业方向发展，而扩大造林则是世界各国林业的头等重要的战略任务。第二次世界大战以后，世界造林面积不断扩大，人工更新在森林更新中的比重不断提高。现在，世界造林是从单纯营造用材林向多种综合经营方向发展，但发达国家和发展中国家则有所不同。近几年来，温带的大多数国家均提出了森林的多目的经营。例如，美国已把相当大面积的森林划为水源林、国家森林公园及游憩林。
    热带发展中国家的造林重点也正在发生变化。从５０年代至７０年代以营造用材林为主。近十几年来，向防护林、社会林业及混农林业方向发展。能源林也是造林发展方向。巴西等国已为解决能源危机提供了经验。
    第９届世界林业大会向世界各国人民和政府呼吁：要充分认识到森林对于生物圈和人类生存的重要意义，为保护和发展森林资源做出贡献。这正是各国林业工作者的努力方向。
