During the Spring Festival, a special-grade physical education teacher from the 12th Middle School in Jilin City visited four students he had personally trained and helped enter a sports college. He hoped they would return to their alma mater to teach after graduation, but they politely declined. I heard about this and was deeply moved.

Can we blame these four college students? Everyone knows that the social status of physical education teachers in China is low, their benefits are poor, and their teaching and training work is very hard. A physical education teacher from the 50th Middle School in Jilin City sold cold noodles during the holiday to make extra money. Another middle school's physical education teacher repaired bicycles at the school gate to earn money. When the school asked him to stop and lead the training, he complained, "A day of training doesn't even earn as much as a few minutes of bicycle repair."

Currently, the situation of middle school physical education teachers is concerning. The social status of teachers is not high, and that of physical education teachers is even lower. After the trend of comparison entered the campus, young physical education teachers do not work diligently, and the phenomenon of job-hopping is quite serious. According to surveys from Shanghai, Nanjing, Anshan, and other cities, the physical education teacher teams in these cities' middle schools are mainly composed of middle-aged and elderly teachers. Those carrying the heavy workload are all teachers over fifty, and the quality of teachers is declining, making it difficult to guarantee teaching quality. Many physical education teachers do not have lesson plans when they teach. Even if they write lesson plans, it is just to pass inspections. How can our schools cultivate students who are well-developed in morality, intelligence, and physical fitness if this continues? If the problem of physical education teachers is not solved, how can school sports improve?

After reading this letter, one can imagine the feelings of that special-grade physical education teacher from Jilin City's middle school. Middle school physical education classes directly affect the physical condition of students who are in their growth and development period, and they are also related to cultivating the comprehensive quality of a new generation of people who are morally, intellectually, physically, and aesthetically developed. Without physical education teachers, it is impossible to effectively carry out physical education classes. It is hoped that this will attract the attention of relevant departments.

### 中学体育教师现状令人忧虑

　　中学体育教师现状令人忧虑
    编辑同志：
    春节期间，吉林市第１２中学一名特级体育教师在看望由他一手培养考入体育学院的４名学生时，提出希望他们毕业后能回母校教学，被他们婉言谢绝。我听到此事后，感触颇深。
    能指责这４名大学生吗？我国体育教师的社会地位之低、待遇之差、教学训练之辛苦尽人皆知。吉林市第５０中学一位体育教师利用假期卖冷面，搞个人创收。还有一所中学的体育教师在校门口修理自行车赚钱，校方劝其收摊带队训练，这位教师抱怨说：“训练一天还不抵我几分钟修车的钱多。”
    目前，中学体育教师的状况令人忧虑。教师社会地位不高，体育教师就更差。攀比风刮进校园后，年轻体育教师工作不踏实，跳槽现象相当严重。据上海、南京、鞍山等地的调查表明，几个城市中学的体育教师队伍以中老年教师为主，挑大梁的尽是年过半百的教师，师资素质呈下降趋势，教学质量难以保证。很多体育教师上课没教案，即使写教案也是为应付检查。这样下去，我们的学校怎么能培养出德智体全面发展的学生呢？体育教师的问题解决不好，学校体育怎么能有起色呢？

    读了这封来信，可以想象吉林市那位中学特级体育教师的心情。中学体育课直接影响到正处在生长发育期间学生的体质，也关系到培养德智体美全面发展的新一代人的素质。没有体育教师，抓好体育课只能是句空话。望能引起有关部门的重视。
