**New Breakthroughs in Peking Opera Art – Discussion on the Peking Opera "Cao Cao and Yang Xu"**

Recently, the Chinese Opera Society, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture, and the editorial department of this newspaper jointly held a discussion on the Peking Opera "Cao Cao and Yang Xu" in Shanghai. Cultural celebrities and drama experts from Beijing and Shanghai, as well as relevant personnel from Shanghai, attended the discussion. The following is a summary of some of the speeches (including written speeches).

**A Deep Resonance Between History and Reality**

Yīng Ruòchéng (Dramatist): At the end of last year, "Cao Cao and Yang Xu" won the first prize for excellence at the Ministry of Culture's Peking Opera New Play Performance, as well as various individual awards. This indicates that everyone is quite positive about it. The appearance of this play can be said to be a significant new breakthrough in the reform of Peking Opera. The play is from Shanghai, and some people say it is a "victory for the Shanghai school." I think that some of the advantages of the old Shanghai school of Peking Opera have indeed been developed in this play, but it has far surpassed the historical Shanghai school of Peking Opera. The ideological value and artistic achievements it demonstrates should be seen as a comprehensive result of long-term exploration, worthy of our multi-faceted discussion.

Fàn Róngkāng (Critic): We have been waiting for a good play on the Peking Opera stage for many years, and now it has finally come out. The fact that this play has been welcomed by the general audience and highly praised by all parties shows that today's political climate is different from the past, and it also shows that our concept of the function of drama has made great progress. At the beginning of the play, we see a very heavy "city wall" and a dragon wall symbolizing imperial power; when the dragon wall is raised, a heart-pounding tragedy is performed. Today, this "city wall" no longer exists, and the heavy, closed history has passed. Now is the era of reform and opening up, and drama has its freedom. The potential of new historical dramas is great, but the difficulty lies in how to handle the relationship between history and reality. Using modern consciousness to re-examine historical right and wrong, to reshape and re-present historical figures and historical events, inevitably involves some connection with reality, which will evoke various associations in the audience and enlighten them, but this is different from intentional allusion or comparison, it is not "using the past to criticize the present" or "using the past to illustrate the present." The audience does not need to "match the numbers." This is a deep resonance between history and reality. I think the success of this play lies in finding this resonance point.

Guō Hànchéng (Critic): Being able to correctly find the connection point between history and reality is a major progress in the creation of historical dramas in recent years. By the connection point between history and reality, I mean that the work truly depicts history while also evoking the beauty and resonance of today's audience. This is the result of the writer's deep understanding of history and passionate feeling for reality. "Cao Cao and Yang Xu" provides us with a very prominent example. This type of excellent work has already broken away from the practice of sacrificing history for some concept, and it is also different from the cautious and meticulous approach of crawling under the rules of history.

Yú Qiūyǔ (Professor): I think the success of this play lies in a deep-seated gene, which is that the playwright, Chén Yàxiān, unintentionally collided with a common psychological hidden aspect of contemporary Chinese audiences. This hidden aspect is passed down from thousands of years of history and has been condensed through several years of painful reflection. I call it the humanistic-historical philosophy that is being experienced and awakened. The mutual maneuvering, coveting, and mutual consumption between Cao Cao and Yang Xu in the play are a structure of opposition between the feudal power personality and the scholar's wisdom personality that runs through Chinese history. The tragic consequences of this structure have been bitterly tasted by the increasingly weary national body and have increasingly aroused national awareness. This play can connect with this structure, both believing in history (not historical truth but historical spirit) and being relevant to the modern era, evoking widespread resonance, and avoiding the one-way tendency of historical drama creation to return to the past or simply to use the past to illustrate the present.

Gōng Hédé (Researcher): Chinese intellectuals have a fine tradition of having a sense of social mission to govern the country and bring peace to the world. In ancient times, they had to realize their ideals by transforming into power (like Cao Cao) or relying on power (like Yang Xu), otherwise, they could only hide in the mountains and live in poverty. In front of powerful figures, there is the issue of how to deal with intelligent figures; in front of intelligent figures, there is the issue of how to handle the "Dao" they believe in and the "power" they rely on. In history, there are few cases where this was handled well, and when it was handled poorly, it often led to tragedy. Yang Xu is a typical example.

Yè Chánghǎi (Associate Professor): This play touches on some deeper layers of social psychology. The character flaws of the tragic figures Cao Cao and Yang Xu may be deeply rooted in the hearts of ordinary people like us, or they may still appear in our daily lives. Otherwise, after watching this play, there would not be so many people sighing.

Wú Zōngxī (Critic): The success of "Cao Cao and Yang Xu" shows that ancient drama genres must be connected to the thoughts and aesthetic tastes of contemporary audiences in order to survive and develop. Even if the characters and plots are historical, the thoughts and philosophies presented can directly appeal to the hearts of contemporary audiences, making them enlightened, thoughtful, associative, and moved, and thus loved by the audience.

**Creating Historical Figures with Modern Psychological Analysis**

Guō Hànchéng: The deep connotation of this play is expressed through the deep conflict of characters. The relationship between Cao Cao and Yang Xu contains two contradictory aspects. On the one hand, Cao Cao's love for Yang Xu's talent is sincere, hoping that Yang Xu will help him realize the great cause of unifying the world; Yang Xu's admiration for Cao Cao's great talent is also sincere, hoping to rely on Cao Cao's political power to end the endless wars in the world. On the other hand, when Cao Cao feels that Yang Xu is threatening his reputation and position, he develops suspicion and a desire to kill; correspondingly, Yang Xu also develops a tendency to drift away from him. The plot develops repeatedly and spirally in such a contradictory movement. Cao Cao does not want to kill Yang Xu but finally kills him; Yang Xu does not want to rebel against Cao Cao but eventually becomes his opponent. Power and intelligence are at odds, politicians and intellectuals are separated. This character portrayal far surpasses the historical records about this case, deeply depicting a heart-rending tragedy—the chronic tragedy of feudal society! It makes us feel a great historical current, surging and flowing, surpassing some trivial wills and interests, and flowing forward.

Xú Xiǎozhōng (Director): I am very cautious about watching works that use ancient stories to reflect on the present, because this type of work often forcibly interprets a historical story to illustrate some modern ideas. It will not make people excited, nor will it provoke deep thoughts in the audience. "Cao Cao and Yang Xu" is not like this. It does not provide the audience with an interpretation of ideas, but focuses on the deep and delicate dissection of the characters' souls, thus proving that this historical tragedy is inevitable. This is its main charm. Some monologues, with sharp words, express the explosive tension between characters, which is a collision of sparks between two personalities, especially having a shocking power.

Chén Gōngmǐn (Critic): Today's playwrights must deeply observe, experience, study, and analyze the various contradictions and psychological states of contemporary society and various types of characters, in order to overcome the limitations of historical materials in historical drama creation, not stopping at writing history for history, and creating truly moving characters for contemporary audiences. Without paying attention to the deep psychological analysis and true experience of roles, it is impossible to have great artistic creation, which is equivalent to admitting that opera only has formal beauty, unrelated to great ideological content and deep psychological truth, which is obviously wrong. "Cao Cao and Yang Xu" is a rare good play that successfully uses modern psychological analysis techniques to create historical figures.

Yú Qiūyǔ: Interestingly, the characters of Cao Cao and Yang Xu are not simply symbolic of two personality systems, but are intertwined. Cao Cao is mainly a feudal power personality, but also has sufficient scholar's wisdom; while Yang Xu, his scholar's wisdom is also intertwined with political intrigue. Thus, their struggle is more deeply excavated in the context of mutual understanding, presenting a complex historical paradox through modern psychological analysis techniques, making people sigh. They are both tragic figures with flaws, with little moral difference, only pointing to the historical burden that still makes people's hearts beat with their tragic life experiences until today.

Liào Bēn (Critic): The play reveals the complexity of human existence and the uncertainty of character evaluation, providing the audience with rich information. Each audience member can obtain different inspirations due to the differences in their life experiences and aesthetic insights. Such character portrayals break away from the traditional opera's common use of loyalty and treachery models, and are not only evaluated by the coordinates of historical merits and demerits, but treat them as aesthetic objects of human character, leading the audience to a profound realm, allowing the audience to taste the bitterness of life, listen to the sighs of the soul, and feel the historical echoes deep in the heart, entering the best aesthetic state.

**Innovative and Complete Stage Art Creation**

Liú Hòushēng (Critic): The completeness of stage art is another major achievement of "Cao Cao and Yang Xu." I think this play truly reaches the state of collaborative efforts where the script is the foundation, the director is the commander, the actors are the main body, and stage design and music are the wings.

Zhāng Gēng (Theorist): In recent years, the opera circle has created many good scripts, but due to the unsatisfactory secondary creation of stage art, good scripts have been "nested" back. A new generation of playwrights has begun to emerge, but a new generation of directors has not yet caught up. This time, seeing "Cao Cao and Yang Xu," I am very happy. Ma Ke's direction is very successful. Directing is a great art. Essentially, it is a matter of understanding the audience. Some people think that the general audience cannot accept profound thoughts and only produce things that cater to low-level needs. If this continues, opera cannot be improved and cannot attract new audiences. Ma Ke's direction of this play can prove that the audience can accept profound thoughts, the key is to have a vivid and lively stage art language to express it. Literary language and stage language are not the same thing, and it takes a director to transform and create. For example, Cao Cao's killing of Kong Wendai, this action is already written in the script, but with just the script's description, the audience may not all understand it. After the director's stage treatment, Cao Cao's psychological clues become clear and vivid, and the audience naturally accepts it. Whether it is Cao Cao or Yang Xu, they are new images on the Peking Opera stage, with great thought-provoking new images. This is the success of the actors and also the success of the director. If opera does not emphasize the importance of the director today, it will not be able to produce new works.

Mǎ Shàobō (Playwright): The script, through the director's secondary creation, becomes more concise and cohesive, and the characters are more prominent. The director is familiar with Peking Opera stage art, with innovative techniques, boldly absorbing elements from sister arts, while maintaining and developing the singing characteristics of Peking Opera. The opening scene directly presents Cao Cao's eagerness to seek talents at Guo Jia's tomb, and the final scene where the two have a dialogue before Yang Xu's execution, elevating it to a short-range confrontation between the two souls, forming a sharp contrast, powerfully excavating the depth of thought, which is the director's stroke of genius.

Huáng Zuòlín (Director): I am a director, especially appreciating Ma Ke's precise grasp of the speed and rhythm of the entire play.

Ā Jiǎ (Director): The director has mastered the overall nature of the play, with innovative ideas and not falling into old patterns. The second curtain is processed into a relief-style dragon wall, with the inside and outside of the scene both separated and connected, and with a sense of historical weight and symbolic meaning, far superior to the second curtain set up just for moving props. The scene of Cao Cao's inspection of the garrison at Xiegou, there are only faint mountain ranges on the stage, without specific signs of fixed locations, making the stage space free and vast. Cao Cao and his generals ride through the snow, whether they come in columns or circle around in rows, there is no obstacle, truly giving a sense of vast desert. The director uses a big martial arts scene to express Cao Cao's wrong judgment of Kong Wendai's behavior and his inner fear, which is particularly brilliant. In short, this play is very inspiring to our peers. Inheriting tradition cannot exclude learning from others. But learning from others is not about drowning out our nation's centuries-old creation, inherited through the body, with a high degree of "body culture," but should give refined performance techniques a new soul, new colors, and new artistic expressiveness.

Liú Hòushēng: Shang Changrong's performance as Cao Cao and Yán Xìngpēng's performance as Yang Xu are truly outstanding. Their brilliant performances can satisfy the audience's artistic needs. Especially Shang Changrong, who has invested a lot of creative passion in the creation of the Cao Cao character, flexibly using his solid basic skills, greatly enriching the literary image. I think this stage image, after several more refinements, will stand tall and straight in the history of Chinese Peking Opera.

Zhào Xún (Critic): The success of the performance fully demonstrates that old opera genres like Peking Opera have not become rigid, and they still have vigorous youthful vitality in art. The key is not in the Peking Opera form itself, but in how artists treat this art form. In the past, discussions on Peking Opera reform had two opposing views: one believed that Peking Opera had already matured and was complete, and should not be easily changed, otherwise, it would be a destruction of traditional art; the other believed that Peking Opera was fixed and could not absorb new things, and must be thoroughly reformed. These two opinions are both extreme. "Cao Cao and Yang Xu" embodies the spirit of bold innovation on the basis of inheriting tradition, digesting the methods absorbed from other arts into an organic part of the whole art, both playing to the strengths of Peking Opera and giving people a fresh feeling.

**Climbing Two More Steps to Make It a Masterpiece**

Huáng Zuòlín: I have a question: What is the character flaw of Yang Xu as a tragic figure? I feel that it is not written clearly enough.

Yīng Ruòchéng: I agree with Old Huang's opinion. Yang Xu's tragedy is not because he is too smart, but because he does not know how to use his intelligence and deal with his intelligence. What is his interpersonal relationship? Why does he always have to hold back? In these places, we seem to understand this person, but we also seem not to understand him. I think the director intentionally arranged his smile, but his smile does not leave a deep impression. Can we think of a way to make Yang Xu's smile a unique artistic language for portraying his character? As long as he smiles, the audience will know: he has understood again and is laughing at people. Arrogance due to talent is his insurmountable flaw. Until his death, he himself knows this flaw, but he cannot overcome it. I hope this play continues to be refined, climbs two more steps, and becomes a masterpiece.

Mǎ Shàobō: Yang Xu sent people to the enemy country to operate, but did not inform the commander, and the necessity of this is not explained. Yang Xu's tragedy is not just a personal tragedy. The so-called "changing my pure teachings, blaming his quickness" is just an excuse. If it is pointed out that Yang Xu's literary entanglement with Cao Pi, political persecution, and the historical environment of "leaking teachings and communicating with princes" (including his relationship with Yuan Shu) at that time, then his tragic nature may be deeper, and the sharp contradiction between loving talent and hating talent will be more profound.

Guō Hànchéng: Yang Xu's behavior of uncovering Zhuge Liang's strange battle array and Cao Cao's "chicken ribs" hidden language, which led to jealousy, seems a bit rash, not like someone who has experienced great life ups and downs, and thus gives people the feeling of seeking trouble.

Huáng Zuòlín: The actors' gestures are not accurate enough, such as using clapping to call someone, which has a bit of a foreign flavor. The chair that Cao Cao sits on while guarding the spirit is a bit like a single-person sofa. The overall design of the stage is very good, but there are some flaws. The second scene uses a very large battle map, which is not in harmony with the style of other scenes.

Xú Xiǎozhōng: From my personal preference, in the creation of musical vocabulary, actor's physical vocabulary, and character shaping vocabulary, it seems a bit too restrained, which may be the current attitude of friends in the opera circle.

Yú Lín (Critic): The Shanghai Peking Opera Theater's organization and leadership of the performance of this play is commendable. A good play needs continuous refinement. In the past, "The Story of the Wronged Woman" was successful, saving Kunqu Opera. The so-called "saving" mainly refers to the revitalization of the artistic creation spirit of artists in this opera genre. Now, the trend of old plays and old performances is very strong in the Peking Opera world, and creation is shrinking. I believe that "Cao Cao and Yang Xu," based on listening to opinions from all parties, will be refined into a masterpiece and become a new repertoire, which will play a great role in revitalizing the creation spirit of the Peking Opera world and even the entire opera world.

　　京剧艺术的新突破        
    ——京剧《曹操与杨修》座谈会纪要
    不久前，中国戏曲学会、上海市文化局和本报文艺部在沪联合召开了京剧《曹操与杨修》座谈会。京、沪两地的文化名流和戏剧专家和上海市有关人士出席了座谈会。现将部分发言（包括书面发言）摘要整理如下。
                                                ——编者
    　　　　贯通历史与现实的深刻共鸣
    英若诚（戏剧家）：在去年１２月文化部举办的京剧新剧目汇演中，《曹操与杨修》荣获优秀奖第一名，还得了各种单项奖，可见大家都比较肯定。这出戏的出现，可以说是戏曲改革工作一次意义重大的新突破。这个戏出在上海，有人说是“海派的胜利”。我认为，过去海派京剧的某些优点在这个戏里确实得到了发扬，但它已远远超越了历史上的海派京剧。它所表现出来的思想价值和艺术成就，应当看作是长期探索的一个综合成果，值得我们多方面去研讨。
    范荣康（评论家）：我们等待京剧舞台出好戏，已等了许多年，现在终于出来了。这出戏能受到广大观众的欢迎和各方面的很高评价，表明今天的政治气候已不同于过去，也表明我们的戏剧功能观念有了很大的进步。戏一开始，我们看到的是非常厚重的“城墙”和象征皇权的龙壁；龙壁吊起，演出了一场惊心动魄的悲剧。今天，这个“城墙”已不存在了，封闭的沉重的历史已经过去。现在是改革、开放的新时期，戏曲有了它的自由。新编历史剧的潜力很大，它的难点在于如何处理历史和现实的关系。用现代意识重新审视历史是非，重塑、再现历史人物和历史事件，不可避免地会与现实有若干联系，会引起观众种种联想并从中得到启迪，但这不同于有意的影射、比附，不是“以古讽今”，也不是“以古喻今”。观众也不必“对号入座”。这是一种贯通历史与现实的深刻共鸣。我想，这出戏的成功，首先就在于找到了这种共鸣点。
    郭汉城（评论家）：能够正确地找到历史与现实的联结点，是近年来历史剧创作的一大进步。所谓历史与现实的联结点，我是指作品真实地描绘了历史而又能引起今天观众美感和共鸣的东西。这是作家深刻地认识历史、热烈地感受现实的结果。《曹操与杨修》又为我们提供了一个很突出的例子。这类优秀作品已经摆脱了为某种观念而牺牲历史的作法，也不同于拜倒在历史的法规下匍匐爬行的谨小慎微。
    余秋雨（教授）：我觉得此剧成功的一个深层基因，在于从剧作者陈亚先开始，不经意地碰撞到了当代广大中国观众一种共同的心理潜藏。这种潜藏是数千年的历史交付给他们，又经过这几年的沉痛反思而获得了凝聚的。我把它称之为正在被体验着唤醒着的人文—历史哲理。戏中曹操和杨修间的互相周旋、觊觎、对耗，本是横贯中国历史的封建权势人格和文人智能人格之间难以调和的对峙结构，这个结构的悲剧性后果早已被日趋疲惫的民族机体苦涩品尝，并越来越引起全民性的内心警觉。这出戏能与这种结构相勾连，既能取信于历史（不是历史真实而是历史精神），又能切中于现代，引起广泛共鸣，免除了过去历史剧创作中经常出现的单向趋古或简单喻今的弊病。　
    龚和德（研究员）：中国知识分子有个优良传统，就是怀有治国平天下的社会使命感。在古代，他们要实现自己的理想，要么转化为权势（如曹操），要么依傍于权势（如杨修），否则，只能隐迹山林，穷愁一生。在权势人物面前有个如何对待智能人物问题；在智能人物面前有个如何处理他们所信奉的“道”和他们所依附的“势”的关系问题。历史上处理得好的很少，处理得不好，往往造成悲剧，杨修就是一个典型的例子。
    叶长海（副教授）：这出戏触及了一些较深层的社会心理领域。曹操与杨修这两个悲剧人物的性格缺陷，也许正深积于我们这些普通人心中，也许依然出现于我们的日常生活之中，否则，在观看此剧之后，就不会有那么多人唏嘘不已。
    吴宗锡（评论家）：《曹操与杨修》的成功表明，古老剧种要生存、要发展，不论其表现什么题材，都必须联系当前观众的思想感情和审美情趣。纵使人物、情节是历史的，而提出的思想、哲理却能直诉当代观众的心灵，使他们有所憬悟，有所思索，有所联想，有所感动，便会受到观众的喜爱。
    　　　　以现代心理分析塑造历史人物
    郭汉城：这出戏的深层意蕴是通过深刻的人物性格冲突体现出来的。曹操与杨修的关系包含着互相矛盾的两方面。一方面，曹操爱杨修的才能是真诚的，希望杨修帮助他实现统一天下的大业；杨修钦慕曹操雄才大略也是虔诚的，希望依靠曹操的政治实力来了结天下战乱不休的局面。另一方面，当曹操感觉到杨修威胁着他的声望、地位时，便产生疑忌、引动杀机；相应地，杨修对他也产生离心倾向。剧情就在这样的矛盾运动中不断地、反复地、螺旋形地发展着。曹操并不愿意杀杨修而终于杀了杨修；杨修并不愿意反曹操而终成了曹操的对立面。权力与才智相左，政治家与知识者相隔。这种人物描写，远远超出了史籍上关于这桩公案的记载，从而深刻地表现了一幕震撼人心的悲剧——封建社会的痼疾性的悲剧！它使我们感到一股历史的巨大潜流，激荡着、运行着，越过人们某些细琐的意志、利害而径自向前流去。它向人们昭示：历史是无情的，应该记住这些教训。
    徐晓钟（导演）：我很发怵看那些用古代故事来反思当今的作品，因为这类作品常常穿凿附会地用一个历史故事来图解某种现代意念。它不会使人激动，也引不起观众深思。《曹操与杨修》不是这样的。它不给观众图解意念，而着力于对人物心灵的深入细腻的剖露，从而证实了这幕历史悲剧是不可避免的。这是它的主要魅力所在。有些念白，唇枪舌剑，表现了人物之间火药味十足的弦外之音，是两种性格爆发出火花来的撞击，特别具有震撼人心的力量。
    陈恭敏（评论家）：今天的剧作家必须深切地观察、体验、研究、分析当代社会的各种矛盾和各类人物的心理状态，才能在历史剧创作中克服历史素材的限制，不停留于为历史而写历史，创造出真正能打动当代观众心灵的人物形象来。不重视对角色深层心理的分析和真实的体验，就不可能有艺术上的伟大创造，就等于承认戏曲只具有形式美，而与巨大的思想内容和深刻的心理真实无涉，这显然是不对的。《曹操与杨修》就是比较成功地运用现代心理分析技巧塑造历史人物的难得的好戏。
    余秋雨：十分有趣的是，曹操与杨修这两个性格并不是简单地象征着两个人格系统，而是互羼互融。曹操以封建权势人格为主，但也有足够的文人智能；而杨修，他的文人智能也与政治权谋相偎依。这样，他们间的争逐就在互相洞悉底里的情况下开掘得更加深入，使一个复杂的历史悖论凭借着现代心理分析技术呈现得让人浩叹。他们都是各有缺陷的悲剧性人物，谈不到多少道德差异，只是各自以悲凉的人生际遇指向着直至今天还使人怦然心动的历史负载。
    廖奔（评论家）：剧中所揭示的人性存在状态的复杂性和人物评价的不确定性，给观众提供了丰富的信息蕴涵，每个观众都可以因自己人生经验与审美悟性的差异而得到不同的感发。这样的人物描写，摆脱了传统戏曲常用的忠奸模式，也不是只以历史功过的座标作为品评尺度，而是把他们作为人类性格的审美对象，将观众带向一种深邃的境界，让观众品味人生的苦涩，倾听心灵的叹息，感发心底深蕴的历史回声，进入最佳的审美状态。
    　　　　新颖、完整的舞台艺术创造
    刘厚生（评论家）：舞台艺术的完整是《曹操与杨修》又一重大成就。我觉得这个戏真正达到了剧本是基础，导演是统帅，演员是主体，舞美、音乐是双翼这样一种通力合作的境地。
    张庚（理论家）：这些年戏曲界创作了不少好剧本，由于舞台艺术二度创造的不理想，把好剧本“窝”回去了。新一代的剧作家已经开始出现，新一代的导演还没有赶上来。这回看了《曹操与杨修》，我高兴极了。马科的导演是很成功的。导演是一门大学问。本质上是一个对观众的认识问题。有些人以为一般观众不能接受深刻的思想，尽搞一些迎合低层次需要的东西。这样下去，戏曲无法提高，无法争取新的观众。马科导演的这个戏可以证明，观众是能够接受深刻思想的，关键要有鲜明生动的舞台艺术语言去表达它。文学语言和舞台语言不是一码事，要靠导演去转换、去创造。例如曹操杀孔文岱，这个行动剧本上已经写了，但光有剧本上写的那些，观众未见得都能通得过，经过导演这样一番舞台处理，曹操的心理线索清晰了，也形象化了，观众自然就接受了。无论是曹操与杨修，都是京剧舞台上的新形象，很有思想意义的新形象。这是演员的成功，也是导演的成功。戏曲到了今天，如果还不强调导演的重要性，是出不了新的。
    马少波（剧作家）：剧本通过导演二度创造，更紧凑凝练，人物也更加突出了。导演熟悉京剧舞台艺术，手法新颖，既大胆吸收姊妹艺术成分，又保持和发扬了京剧的演唱特色。开场单刀直入地展现曹操早在郭嘉墓前等候杨修那种求贤若渴的紧迫性的艺术处理，与最后一场在杨修刑前两人对话升华为两人灵魂深处的短兵相接，构成鲜明对照，有力地开掘出思想的深度，是导演的神来之笔。
    黄佐临（导演）：我是做导演工作的，特别欣赏马科对整个戏的速度、节奏的准确掌握。
    阿甲（导演）：导演掌握了全剧的整体性，构思新颖，不落旧套。二道幕处理成浮雕式龙壁，景内景外既隔又连，并有一种历史沉重感和象征意义，比之专为搬动道具而设的二道幕不知道要高明多少。曹操斜谷巡营一场，舞台上只有隐隐的山脉，没有那些固定地点的具体标志，使舞台空间自由广阔，曹操与众将踏雪驰骋，不管是纵队迎面而来还是横队大兜圈子，都无妨碍，真有数十里茫茫大漠的感觉。导演用一场大武戏来表现曹操对孔文岱行为的错误判断和内心恐惧，是特别精彩的。总之，这个戏对我们同行颇有启发。继承传统决不能排斥借鉴。但借鉴又不是靠五光十色的热闹玩艺儿来淹没掉我们民族数百年来创造的、以肉体继承的高度“人体文化”，而是应该赋予精湛的表演技巧以新的灵魂，新的色彩，新的艺术表现力。
    刘厚生：尚长荣饰演的曹操和言兴朋饰演的杨修，堪称双璧。他们的精彩表演能让观众感到艺术上的满足。特别是尚长荣，在曹操这一艺术形象创造上倾注了巨大的创作激情，灵活地运用了深厚的基本功夫，大大丰富了文学形象。我想这个舞台形象再经过几番磨砺，将会堂堂正正地进入中国京剧史。
    赵寻（评论家）：演出的成功充分说明，像京剧这样的老剧种并没有僵化，它在艺术上仍有旺盛的青春活力。关键不在京剧形式本身，而在艺术家如何对待这种艺术形式。过去讨论京剧革新曾有两种对立的观点：一种认为京剧已经成熟、完整，不可轻易改动，否则就是对传统艺术的破坏；另一种认为京剧程式固定，不能吸收新东西，必须彻底改造。这两种意见各走极端。《曹操与杨修》体现了在继承传统基础上的大胆创新精神，把从其他艺术中吸收进来的手法加以消化，成为整体艺术中的有机部分，既发挥了京剧的优势，又让人感到格调清新。
    　　　　再上两层台阶，要搞成精品
    黄佐临：我提个问题：杨修作为悲剧人物的性格缺陷是什么？我觉得写得还不够清楚。
    英若诚：我同意黄老的意见。杨修的悲剧，并不是因为他太聪明，而在于他不善于运用自己的聪明、对待自己的聪明。他的人际关系怎样？他为什么碰到问题总是忍不住？这些地方我们又像懂了这个人，又像不那么懂这个人。我看导演是有意识地安排他的笑，但他的笑给人的印象还不够深刻。能否再想点办法，使杨修的笑成为刻画他性格的独特的艺术语言。只要他一笑，观众就知道：他又明白了，又在笑话人了。恃才傲物，是他不可克服的缺点。直到死，他自己也知道这个毛病，就是克服不了。我希望这出戏继续加工，再上两层台阶，成为精品。
    马少波：杨修派人去敌国活动，而不使主帅得知，其必要性缺乏交待。杨修的悲剧，不仅是个人的悲剧。所谓“渝我淳则，怪其敏捷”，不过是个借口。如果点明杨修与曹植的文字瓜葛、政治株连和当时“漏泄言教，交关诸侯”（包括他与袁术的甥舅关系）的历史环境，则其悲剧性可能会更深刻，爱才与忌才尖锐矛盾的思想意义会更深广。
    郭汉城：杨修识破诸葛亮古怪战表和曹操“鸡肋”隐语而遭忌的行为，显得有些轻率，不像出于已经经历过巨大生活波折的人，因而给人有自讨苦吃之感。
    黄佐临：演员的手势有不够准确之处，如用拍手来叫人，就有点外国味。曹操守灵时坐的那把椅子，有点像单人沙发。舞台设计总的构思很好，但有败笔。第二场用了一个很大的作战地图，与别的景风格不协调。
    徐晓钟：从我个人的喜好来看，在音乐语汇、演员形体语汇、人物造型语汇等创造方面，似嫌过于拘谨了，这恐怕是目前戏曲界朋友比较普遍的心态吧。
    俞琳（评论家）：上海京剧院组织领导这出戏的演出，其胆识、气魄值得称赞。一出好戏，需要不断磨练。当年《十五贯》成功，救活了昆剧。所谓“救活”，主要是振奋了这个剧种的艺术家们的创造精神。现在，京剧舞台老戏老演的陈腐之风甚盛，创作萎缩。相信《曹操与杨修》在听取各方面意见的基础上，加工成为精品，成为新的保留剧目，对于振奋京剧界以至整个戏曲界的创造精神，必将起到很大的作用。
