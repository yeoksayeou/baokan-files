Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 14th.

According to foreign reports quoting the Chilean Navy, approximately 40 whales committed suicide on a beach in the Strait of Magellan on March 13th. This is the third time in a week that whales have committed suicide in this location.

The report states that these black whales, measuring 3 to 8 meters in length, were stranded on a beach about 35 kilometers north of the city of Punta Arenas. A rescue team is currently assisting the whales in returning to the sea.

Last week, around 140 whales also committed suicide on this beach. With the help of the navy and fishermen, most of the whales have returned to the sea.

The cause of the whales' collective suicide is not yet clear, but some experts believe it may be due to abnormal heat in the water, which could have disrupted their sonar systems.

　　四十头鲸自杀智利海滩
    新华社北京３月１４日电  据外电援引智利海军的话说，３月１３日又有约４０头鲸在麦哲伦海峡一海滩集体自杀。这是一周内鲸第三次在这里集体自杀。
    消息说，这些黑鲸身长３—８米，搁浅在距智利蓬塔阿雷纳斯港口城市以北约３５公里处的海滩上。现已有一支营救队在帮助鲸回归大海。
    上周大约有１４０头鲸也在这个海滩集体自杀，在海军和渔民的帮助下，大部分鲸已回归大海。
    造成鲸集体自杀的原因尚不清楚，但一些专家认为，可能是该水域出现异热，使它们的声纳系统失灵所致。
