The largest poetry gathering in the world was a meeting of merchants and literary figures, drinking wine, composing poetry, and engaging in literary pursuits. Such scenes were common in Yangzhou in ancient times. Among these gatherings, the most elegant was the "Peach Blossom Festival at Hongqiao."

The largest "Peach Blossom Festival at Hongqiao" was initiated by the famous scholar Lu Jianceng. Lu Jianceng, whose courtesy name was Baosun and whose pseudonym was Yayu Mountain Man, was from Dezhou, Shandong. During his tenure as the Commissioner of Salt Transportation (the head of the salt merchants), Lu Jianceng invited famous scholars of Yangzhou to gather at Hongqiao in the 22nd year of the Qianlong reign (1757 AD). He wrote four seven-line poems himself, and more than 7,000 people responded with poems. Some people even responded multiple times. For example, Zheng Banqiao, who was ranked first among the "Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou," wrote four poems titled "Responding to Yayu Mountain Man's Peach Blossom Festival at Hongqiao" and another four titled "Responding Again to Lu Yayu." In total, tens of thousands of poems were composed during this gathering, and when compiled, they amounted to more than 300 volumes. The "Complete Tang Poems" includes poems from the Tang Dynasty over a period of 300 years, totaling about 40,000 poems from 2,200 families, which is still less than this single poetry gathering. Therefore, this "Peach Blossom Festival at Hongqiao" can be considered the largest poetry gathering in the world.

News of this grand "Peach Blossom Festival at Hongqiao" quickly spread to Beijing, and Emperor Qianlong heard about it. Soon after, when Emperor Qianlong traveled south to Yangzhou, he specially visited the Dahuang Garden and praised the "Peach Blossom Festival at Hongqiao." At Lu Jianceng's request, Emperor Qianlong personally named the garden "Yihong Garden" and built a pavilion with a stele beside the "Peach Blossom Festival at Hongqiao," with two of his poems inscribed on it.

### 世界上规模最大的诗会

　　世界上规模最大的诗会
    商人与文人墨客聚会，饮酒赋诗，舞文弄墨，古时在扬州城随处可见。其中最为风雅的诗会，莫过于“虹桥修禊”了。
    规模最大的一次“虹桥修禊”盛会，是由著名文学家卢见曾发起的。卢见曾字抱孙，号雅雨山人，山东德州人。卢见曾在任两淮转运使（即盐商总头目）期间，于乾隆２２年（公元１７５７年）邀请扬州名士聚会虹桥，自作七律诗四首，唱和诗者竟达７０００余人。有人竟一和再和，如名列扬州八怪之首的郑板桥就有《和雅雨山人虹桥修禊》四首、《再和卢雅雨》四首。这次诗会总共作诗数万首，合编成集竟达３００余卷巨帙。《全唐诗》收有唐代３００年之诗，也不过２２００余家，共４万余首，竟不及这一次诗会。这在世界诗歌史上是绝无仅有的，所以这次“虹桥修禊”堪称世界上规模最大的诗会。
    这次“虹桥修禊”盛会事，很快就传入了北京城，乾隆皇帝也有耳闻。不久，乾隆皇帝下江南到扬州时，特地观赏了大洪园，盛赞“虹桥修禊”事。应卢见曾之请，乾隆皇帝御赐园名为“倚虹园”，并在“虹桥修禊”旁建碑亭，御制二诗刻碑上。
