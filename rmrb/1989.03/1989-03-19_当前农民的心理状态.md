	The Current Psychological State of Farmers
	Recently, the Propaganda Department of the Jiujiang Municipal Committee conducted a survey of 1,117 household heads from 11 counties and districts with good, average, and poor economic conditions. They analyzed and processed more than 16,300 data points, categorizing them into three themes: "Analysis of Rural Situation," "Discussion on Rural Thought and Political Work," and "Analysis of Wealth Accumulation Views."

	In the questionnaire survey, 70.8% of the farmers believed that the reforms had achieved "significant results," while only 7.9% thought that the reforms were "not successful." 85.1% of the respondents felt that their living standards had "improved significantly" or "improved," indicating that they had benefited economically. However, they also noticed some existing issues, particularly with "agricultural product prices and supply of agricultural materials," "social security and social ethics," and "implementation of rural policies," which were the main concerns of over 90% of the surveyed households.

	62.8% of the farmers felt that "thought and political work in recent years has weakened," mainly because there was an emphasis on getting rich while neglecting education. Meetings focused on "commodity economy," and broadcasts talked about "millionaires," with little discussion on thought and political education. 80.6% of the farmers urgently called for strengthening rural thought and political work. However, they did not like attending meetings and listening to long speeches; instead, they preferred "policy dissemination in rural areas," "agricultural technology lectures," and "discussions on village affairs," showing a strong sense of democracy and equality.

	Farmers' views on wealth accumulation have changed, with their product structure shifting from a single agricultural type to a diversified type including agriculture, industry, commerce, transportation, and sideline production. However, what is the dominant industry in household economics? 72.2% of the farmers answered "planting and breeding," 21.3% answered "handicrafts and sideline production," and only 6.5% of the farmers' main economic source was "commerce and industrial operations." From the analysis of "farmers' preferred wealth accumulation paths," 35.6% of the farmers chose planting as the path to wealth, making it the top choice among factory operations, commerce, breeding, and transportation, indicating that farmers currently have a strong interest in planting and are beneficial for the development of grain production and economic crops.

　　当前农民的心理状态
    最近，九江市委宣传部调查了经济状况好、中、差３个层次的１１个县区１１１７名农民户主，分析和处理了１６３００多个数据，归类形成了“农村形势评说”、“农村思想政治工作谈”和“致富观剖析”３个专题。
    问卷调查中认为改革“成绩很大”的农民占７０．８％，说改革“搞得不好”的只占７．９％。８５．１％的人深深感到自己的生活水平“有了很大提高”和“提高”，经济上得到了实惠。但是，他们也看到了当前存在的一些实际问题，特别是对“农产品价格和农资供应”、“社会治安和社会风气”、执行“农村政策”等３个问题意见最大，占了调查户中的９０％以上。
    ６２．８％的农民“对近年来的思想政治工作的感受”是“削弱了”，主要表现在：重致富、轻教育，开会讲的是“商品经济”，广播里说的是“万元户”，很少谈到思想政治教育。８０．６％的农民迫切要求加强农村思想政治工作。但他们不喜欢开会听大报告，而喜欢“听传达农村政策”、“讲农业科技”和“商讨村民的事”，表现出较强的民主和平等意识。
    农民的致富观已有新的变化，产品结构已由过去单一的农业型转变为农、工、商、运、副并存的多样型。但在家庭经济中占主导地位的产业是什么？７２．２％的农民回答仍是“种植业和养殖业”，２１．３％农民回答是“手工业和副业”，只有６．５％农民主要经济来源是“经商和办工业”。从“农民赞成的致富途径”分析，有３５．６％的农民选择种植业致富，为办厂、经商、养殖、运输等５项之首，说明当前农民对种植业的兴趣浓厚，对发展粮食生产和经济作物有利。
