Uncle Earth, you have malnutrition! This is the diagnosis given by Hua Tuo, a renowned doctor from the Eastern Han Dynasty, to the "landlord" of the earth. Hua Tuo's prescription is to "eat more and work less." This is indeed a timely remedy for the current situation.

In recent years, the earth has been overworked and over-exploited, leading to a decline in its productivity. The soil has become depleted, and the environment has been polluted. This has resulted in a decrease in the quality and quantity of agricultural products, which in turn has affected the livelihoods of farmers and the overall economy.

To address this issue, we must follow Hua Tuo's advice and give the earth a chance to rest and recover. This means reducing the amount of land under cultivation, rotating crops, and using organic fertilizers. It also means implementing stricter environmental regulations and promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

By doing so, we can improve the health of the earth and ensure a steady supply of high-quality agricultural products. This will not only benefit farmers but also contribute to the overall development of the economy. Let us all work together to give the earth the care it needs and deserve.
