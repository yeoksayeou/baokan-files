	Jiangsu Representatives Discuss the New Strategy:
	All Development Based on Technological Progress
	By Zhu Weiqun

	Last year, Jiangsu Province formally proposed the decision to "revitalize the province through science and technology" at the provincial science and technology conference. What is the basis for this decision, and how has it progressed? Five representatives from Jiangsu enthusiastically accepted my interview.

	"Jiangsu's total industrial and agricultural output value has been at the top of the country for six consecutive years, and the per capita grain possession has exceeded 1,000 jin for five consecutive years. However, behind this, the actual total investment growth rate in the past 10 years has been higher than the total output growth rate. Since 1984, when agriculture reached its highest historical level, further development has become increasingly difficult. This shows that Jiangsu's economy has reached a turning point and must shift from mainly expanding external dimensions to mainly expanding internal dimensions, from extensive production to intensive production." Vice Governor Wu Xijun said: "Revitalizing the province through science and technology is to establish a new mechanism for the integrated development of economy, society, and science and technology on the basis of the original comprehensive strength, and to base all aspects of development on technological progress."

	Provincial Party Secretary Sun Jian said: "Some people think that revitalizing the province through science and technology is inconsistent with rectification and adjustment, but in fact, it is the opposite. The macro-control and less input, more output required by rectification and adjustment are precisely an opportunity for revitalizing the province through science and technology."

	Nanjing Mayor Dai Shunzhi said: "In economically developed countries, the factor of technological progress in economic growth can reach 70-80%, while Nanjing only has 30%. As a government, the primary task is to unite the forces of various departments to technological progress, to release greater internal energy of the economy. At present, we need to accelerate the promotion of a batch of comprehensive energy-saving and material-saving technologies, as well as agricultural technologies that serve the development of southern hilly and mountainous areas, in response to actual difficulties."

	As the head of a university, Qu Qinyue and Wei Yi think more about establishing an educational and scientific research structure that adapts to the revitalization of the province through science and technology. Qu Qinyue said: "Nanjing University should cultivate more applied talents urgently needed for social and economic development, and provide more scientific research achievements for the main economic battlefield." Wei Yi believes that at present, the scientific and technological services of universities are still mostly "cooked on the spot," which is undoubtedly still necessary; but at the same time, universities should have a higher-level consideration, that is, to use their advantages to serve high-tech industries and enterprise groups.

### 人大代表谈江苏的新战略  一切发展立足科技进步

　　人大代表谈江苏的新战略        
    一切发展立足科技进步
    本报记者  朱维群
    去年，江苏省在全省科技会议上正式提出“科技兴省”的决策。这一决策依据是什么，进展怎么样？五位江苏代表热情地接受了我的采访。
    “江苏工农业总产值连续６年居全国首位，人均占有粮食也连续５年超千斤。但是在这背后，１０年来全省实际总投入增长速度高于总产出增长速度，自１９８４年农业达到历史最高水平后，再发展也愈来愈感困难。这说明，江苏经济已到了转轨变型的关头，必须从以扩大外延为主转为以扩大内涵为主，从粗放型生产转为集约型生产。”副省长吴锡军说：“科技兴省，就是在原有综合实力基础上建立一种经济、社会、科技发展一体化的新机制，把各方面发展都建立在科技进步的基础上。”
    省委副书记孙颔说：“有人认为科技兴省与治理整顿不一致，其实相反。治理整顿所要求的宏观调控、少投入多产出，对于科技兴省恰恰是一种机遇。”
    南京市市长戴顺智说：“经济发达的国家经济增长中科技进步因素可达７０—８０％，而南京只有３０％。作为政府，首要任务就是把各部门力量统一到科技进步上来，引发经济更大的内在能量。当前要针对实际困难加速推广一批综合节能、节材技术，以及为南方丘陵山区开发服务的农用技术。”
    作为高等院校负责人的曲钦岳和韦钰，考虑得更多的是建立与科技兴省相适应的教育和科研结构。曲钦岳说：“南京大学应多培养社会经济发展急需的各类应用型人才，多为经济主战场提供科研成果。”韦钰认为，当前高校科技服务仍以应急性的“现炒现卖”居多，这无疑仍将是必要的；但同时高校应有高一层次的考虑，即利用优势为高技术产业和企业集团服务。
