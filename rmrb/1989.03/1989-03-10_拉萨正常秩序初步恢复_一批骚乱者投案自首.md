Today, the streets of Lhasa are calm. Most government agencies, enterprises, and public institutions have resumed normal operations, and some shops have reopened. The number of pedestrians on the streets has noticeably increased compared to yesterday. The armed police and soldiers who have not rested for two consecutive nights are still on duty at various posts. Along the sidewalks, off-duty armed police soldiers are sleeping soundly on the ground.

It is reported that after the imposition of martial law, some residents were initially worried but later felt safe as they saw the streets calm down. Some residents still misunderstand this necessary deterrent force, and a few even have a hostile attitude toward it.

In other news, on the afternoon of the 9th, leaders of the Tibet Autonomous Region's Party, government, and military, including Hu Jintao, Duoji Cairang, Mao Rubo, Jiangcun Luobu, and Zhang Shaosong, visited the Chengguan District Public Security Bureau, the Armed Police General Hospital, and the Tibet Military Region General Hospital to comfort police and armed police soldiers who were injured while suppressing the riots.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, March 9th. After the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Government issued the martial law order, a batch of people who participated in the riots voluntarily turned themselves in to the public security organs today.

According to the Tibet Autonomous Region Public Security Bureau, these individuals who turned themselves in confessed to their illegal activities such as parading, beating, smashing, looting, and burning over the past few days, and also exposed other accomplices. The Tibet Public Security Bureau stated that lenient treatment will be given.

　　拉萨正常秩序初步恢复
    一批骚乱者投案自首
    本报拉萨３月９日电  记者卢小飞报道：今天，拉萨街头风平浪静。绝大部分机关、企、事业单位初步恢复正常工作，一些商店陆续开门。白天，街上的行人已明显比昨日增多。连续两夜没有休息好的武警和解放军战士仍在各岗值勤。路边的人行道上，换下岗的武警战士们正在地铺上酣睡。
    据悉，戒严令发布之后，一些居民曾一度有些担心，后看到街头平静，遂有了安全感。一些居民对这种必要的震慑力量仍有误解，个别甚至有抵触情绪。
    又讯　９日下午，西藏自治区党、政、军领导胡锦涛、多吉才让、毛如柏、江村罗布和张少松等人，分别到城关区公安分局、武警总医院和西藏军区总医院慰问在平息骚乱中受伤的公安、武警战士。
    据新华社拉萨３月９日电　西藏自治区人民政府发布戒严令后，今天已有一批参与骚乱的人主动到公安机关投案自首。
    据西藏自治区公安部门透露，这些投案自首者交待了自己前几天非法游行和打、砸、抢、烧的罪行，并检举揭发了其他同案犯。西藏公安机关表示将给予宽大处理。
