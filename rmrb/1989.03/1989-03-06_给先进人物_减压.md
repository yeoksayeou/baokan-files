Relieving Pressure on Exemplary Individuals

Shangguan Fu

“Being a model is hard!” “Being an exemplary individual is hard!” Such sighs are often heard. But what exactly makes it hard? Recently, I came across two pieces of material that help to clarify the issue.

	— A model platoon leader from the border defense forces in Yunnan has been awarded two meritorious citations and received 19 commendations. He has been named an outstanding party member by his brigade and regiment for six consecutive years. However, he suffers from duodenal ulcers, gastric ptosis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, and post-concussion syndrome. He requested a transfer to a headquarters position, but since then, he has been troubled by public opinion. Some leaders believe that a hero should not be so picky about his work, and if his request is granted, it will set a bad precedent. Others think that such a transfer will diminish the luster of the model.

	— A soldier from a certain regiment in the Shenyang Military Region bravely fought against a knife-wielding criminal and was awarded an honorary title by the local government, along with a reward of 1,400 yuan. Some “well-meaning” individuals immediately advised him, “It’s commendable that you stepped forward to catch the criminal. We hope you will also set a good example in handling the reward money.” Some suggested he use the money for the unit’s construction, while others encouraged him to buy books for at-risk youth or donate to the welfare of the disabled, so that “your example will be even more perfect.” The soldier felt burdened by the reward money, like carrying a heavy load, and had to request to donate it to the unit to get rid of the pressure.

	It is clear that being an exemplary individual is hard, mainly because one has to be perfect in every way. The core issue is that one must not have a single “selfish” thought. As an exemplary individual, you must only talk about sacrifice and not about gain, only about duty and not about rights; you must not have personal interests or make personal requests; you must set an example in everything, not pick and choose in terms of appearance when finding a partner, and not demand a divorce even if the relationship breaks down… However, exemplary individuals are also human, living in the same world, with joys and sorrows. They handle the balance between public and private interests better than others, showing public-mindedness, selflessness, and a spirit of helping others and doing what is right. But we cannot ignore the legitimate interests and reasonable needs of exemplary individuals, nor can we impose unreasonable demands on them, making them feel an unbearable pressure. Otherwise, who would still want to be a model or an exemplary individual?

	To truly care for exemplary individuals and hope that more people will become exemplary, we need to reduce some of the pressure on them. First, leadership organizations need to get rid of the influence of “leftist” thinking, no longer mold models in the “perfect” mold, and not use the creation of models as a means to gain credit. It is encouraging that the two incidents mentioned above were handled appropriately. The model platoon leader’s request for a transfer was finally approved by his superiors. The soldier’s reward money issue was clearly stated by the regiment’s party committee: the money belongs to him personally, and he has the right to dispose of it. Others should not interfere, and it is not allowed to judge the ideological level of an exemplary individual based on whether or not the reward money is donated or how much is donated. May such enlightened leadership become more common! Secondly, the people around exemplary individuals need to change some of their old ideas. They should not give advice to make the exemplary model “better” by setting difficult tasks, nor should they ridicule or mock them for having some flaws or weaknesses. Moreover, our media should be factual and not exaggerate. It is better to understate than to overstate. If we don’t say enough, it doesn’t harm the exemplary individuals; but if we say too much, not only will the exemplary individuals feel embarrassed and alienated from the masses, but the credibility of the media will also be damaged.

	If exemplary individuals have a relatively relaxed environment and can control their own destinies, people will not be afraid to be exemplary. Exemplary individuals will be seen as trustworthy, lovable, and worthy of emulation by the masses, rather than being deified or distorted.

### 给先进人物“减压”

　　给先进人物“减压”
    上官茀
    “当典型难！”“做先进人物难！”常听到这样的慨叹。究竟难在哪里？最近看到两个材料，觉得有助于释疑解惑。
    ——云南边防一个标兵连长，曾两次荣立战功，１９次受嘉奖，连续６年被师、团评为优秀党员。可也集十二指肠溃疡、胃下垂、严重风湿性关节炎和脑震荡后遗症于一身，因而请求调到机关工作。从此，饱受人言困扰。领导干部中也有人认为英模这样挑剔工作，不能应允，否则引起“连锁反应”，后患无穷。有人则认为这样调动会使典型失去光彩。
    ——沈阳军区某团一个战士奋不顾身同持刀歹徒搏斗，被地方政府授予荣誉称号并发给１４００元奖金。一些“热心人”马上提醒：“你挺身而出捉歹徒是好样的，希望在对待奖金问题上也做出好样子。”有的建议他用这笔钱为部队建设做些贡献，有的启发他为失足青年购买书籍或为残疾人福利事业捐款，这样，“你这个典型就更完美了”。这位战士拿着奖金如同背上沉重的包袱，只好找到团里要求捐献，以便解脱。
    可见先进难当，难就难在要十全十美，核心是不准有一个“私”字。既是先进人物，你就要只讲奉献不讲索取，只讲义务不讲权利；你就不能有个人利益，提个人要求；你就要处处“垂范”，找对象也不要挑长相，感情破裂了也不要提出离婚……然而先进人物也是人，食人间烟火，有喜怒哀乐，他们在公与私的问题上，比其他人摆得正一些，处理得好一些，表现为先公后私，公而忘私，助人为乐，见义勇为等等，但不能抹煞先进人物的合法利益和正当需要，向他们提出有悖情理的苛求，使先进人物感到难以承受的压力，否则谁还愿意当典型、当先进呢？
    真正爱护先进，希望有更多的人先进，倒是需要给先进人物减轻一些压力。首先，领导机关要摆脱“左”的思想影响，不再按“高大全”模式“塑造”典型，也不把塑造典型作为邀功的资本。令人高兴的是，上述两件事都得到了恰当的处理。标兵连长请调工作的要求终于得到上级的批准。战士的奖金问题，团党委明确指出：奖金属于他个人，支配权在他自己，别人不得干涉，更不允许以奖金是否交公或交公多少来衡量先进人物思想境界的高低。愿这样的开明领导越来越多！其次，先进人物周围的人们要改变一下某些旧的观念，既不要为使先进典型“好上加好”而给他出这样那样的主意，实际是出难题，也不必见到他们身上有一些缺点弱点就讽刺挖苦。还有，我们的舆论宣传一定要实事求是，不任意拔高。宁可失之于宣扬不足，也不要失之于渲染过分。说得不够，对先进人物没有什么坏处；说过头了，不但使先进人物难堪，脱离群众，也会使舆论工具信誉受损。
    让先进人物有一个比较宽松的环境，能够自己掌握自己的命运，人们就不怕当先进，先进人物在群众眼中就是可信可亲可学的人物，而不是被神化、扭曲的人物。
