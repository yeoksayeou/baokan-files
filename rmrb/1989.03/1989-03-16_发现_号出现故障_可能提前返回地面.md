The U.S. space shuttle Discovery has experienced a malfunction in its power supply system, which may shorten its flight duration and lead to an early return to Earth.

Discovery is equipped with three power fuel tanks. Astronauts noticed that one of them is malfunctioning. To conserve power, some lights, a computer, and other non-essential instruments have been turned off. Astronauts are working with NASA's ground engineers to address this issue. Ground controllers have stated that the reduction in power does not pose a risk to the astronauts' safety.

Discovery was initially scheduled to land at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 9:30 AM Eastern Standard Time on the 18th. If power is insufficient, the flight may end a day earlier, but the final decision will be made tomorrow.

Today marks the second day of Discovery's flight. Astronauts conducted an artificial incubation experiment on 32 fertilized chicken eggs. This is the first time the U.S. scientific community has studied the development of animal embryos in a zero-gravity environment. Yesterday, Discovery successfully placed a communications satellite into Earth's orbit.

　　“发现”号出现故障  可能提前返回地面
    本报华盛顿３月１４日电  记者仓立德报道：美国航天飞机“发现”号的动力供应系统出现故障，有可能缩短飞行时间，提前返回地面。
    “发现”号上共有３个动力燃料箱，宇航员从仪表上发现其中之一工作失常。为节省动力，已关闭了一些照明灯、一部电脑及其他无关紧要的仪器。宇航员正在配合国家航空航天局的地面工程师共同处理这一故障。据地面操纵人员说，动力的减少对宇航员的安全没有危险。
    “发现”号初步定于１８日美国东部标准时间上午９时３０分在加利福尼亚州爱德华兹空军基地降落。如动力不足，可能提前１天结束飞行，但最后决定要待明天才能作出。
    今天是“发现”号飞行的第二天。宇航员对３２个鸡蛋受精卵进行了人工孵化试验。这是美国科学界第一次展开动物胚胎在地球引力为零时如何发育的研究。昨天，“发现”号已成功地将一枚通讯卫星送入地球轨道。
