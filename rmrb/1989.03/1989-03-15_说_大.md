Title: On the Word "Big"

In the past—

Big Leap Forward, Big Steel Smelting, Big People's Communes;

Big Class Struggle, Big Revolutionary Criticism;

Big Speak Out, Big Airing of Views, Big-character Posters, Big Debate;

Big People's War against ××××...

Now—

Holiday discounts, big celebrations; new fashion furniture big sales;

Human body art big exhibition, social news big competition;

National calligraphy and painting big exhibition, contemporary love letters international big award competition;

× place uncovers a big case, × city investigates a major case;

Yin and Yang big split, artificial big abortion, 21st-century big explosion...

The "big" of the past was often associated with "leftist" guiding ideology; it was born with political movements. In recent years, such "big" is rarely heard of or seen. This is the country's fortune, the people's fortune!

The "big" of today is not the same as the "big" of the past. But how frequent it appears, how wide its application! When it should be big, it is big; when it should not be big, it is also big. It is inevitable that people feel it is exaggerated, boastful, and seeking to attract attention.

Why do the Chinese people like "big" so much? I hope the wise can enlighten me.

### 说“大”

　　说“大”
    钟怀
    过去——
    大跃进，大炼钢铁，大办人民公社；
    大抓阶级斗争，开展革命大批判；
    大鸣，大放，大字报，大辩论；
    大打一场××××的人民战争……
    　　　　　　
    现在——
    节日优惠大酬宾，新潮家具大展销；
    人体艺术大展，社会新闻大赛；
    全国书画大联展，当代情书国际大奖赛；
    ×地揭出一起大案，×市查处一起特大案件；
    阴阳大裂变，人工大流产，二十一世纪大爆炸……
    过去的“大”，往往与“左”的指导思想相联系；与政治运动相伴生。近几年，这样的“大”难得听到见到了。这是国家的幸运，人民的幸运！
    现在的“大”与过去的“大”，不可同日而语。但出现的频率何其多，应用的范围何其广。当“大”则大，不当“大”也“大”起来，难免使人有渲染、浮夸、哗众取宠之感。
    国人何以如此好“大”？愿智者有以教我。
