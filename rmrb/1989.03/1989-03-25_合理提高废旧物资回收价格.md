Title: Reasonably Increase the Prices for Recycled Waste Materials

In recent years, the prices of various commodities in our country have risen, while the prices for recycled waste materials have remained pitifully low. Take toothpaste tubes, for example; the recycling price is only 2 fen per tube, and sometimes they won't even accept them for free. The recycling price for a single aluminum can is just 3 fen. It is said that the price of toothpaste and canned beverages has risen because the price of aluminum has skyrocketed. Currently, the price of aluminum per ton has risen from a few thousand yuan to over ten thousand yuan. Some factories are facing production difficulties due to a shortage of aluminum raw materials, while others are willing to endure the "middlemen's" layer upon layer of exploitation and purchase aluminum materials at high prices. Why not increase the purchase price for recycled aluminum to boost aluminum production?

Other waste materials are similar. For example, waste plastics, various glass bottles and broken glass, as well as waste copper, waste iron, and waste paper—if the prices are reasonable, the public will definitely be motivated to sell waste materials. Turning waste into treasure benefits both the country and the people. Why not do it?

I hope that relevant national departments will pay attention to the work of recycling, developing, and utilizing waste materials, and purchase waste materials at reasonable prices.

### 合理提高废旧物资回收价格

　　合理提高废旧物资回收价格
    近年来，我国各种商品的价格上涨，而废旧物资的收购价格却低得可怜。就说牙膏皮吧，回收价每个只有２分钱，甚至白给也不收；一个易拉罐的回收价仅３分钱。据说牙膏、易拉罐装饮料价格上涨，就是因为铝材料价格大涨。目前，每吨铝的价格已由过去的几千元涨到上万元。有的厂家因铝原料短缺，生产已受到影响，有的厂家则甘愿受“倒爷”的层层盘剥，高价购进铝材料。为什么不可以提高废铝的收购价格，以增加铝的生产呢？
    其它废品也是如此，如废旧塑料、各种玻璃瓶子和碎玻璃以及废铜、废铁、废纸等，只要价格合理，群众一定会有卖废品的积极性。变废为宝，利国利民，何乐而不为呢？！
    希望国家有关部门重视废旧物资的回收、开发、利用工作，以合理的价格回收废品。
