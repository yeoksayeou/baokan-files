Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 29th. (Reporters Ding Jianming, Intern Xu Wei) Materials provided by the People's Bank of China indicate that the current situation of currency withdrawal in China is improving. As of March 28th, banks have net withdrawn 8.73 billion yuan this year, which is 7.65 billion yuan more than the same period last year. By this point, all the currency released into society before this year's Spring Festival has been fully withdrawn.

Due to the fact that this year's Spring Festival was eleven days earlier than last year, under normal circumstances, the speed of currency withdrawal in March should be slower than the same period last year. However, up to now, the nationwide currency withdrawal has maintained a good momentum.

Currency is a comprehensive reflection of the national economy. Some experts believe that the current currency withdrawal situation shows that the nationwide rectification and regulation work has achieved initial results. Analysis shows that the main reasons for the good currency withdrawal situation are: since this year, the market has been stable, the momentum of rapid price increases has been curbed, and the public's psychology is relatively stable; at the same time, the commercial sector has vigorously organized the supply of goods, increasing the currency withdrawal of goods. Starting from February 1st, the state has once again raised the savings deposit interest rate, and savings deposits have increased significantly.

　　全国货币回笼情况好转　春节前投放的已全部回笼
    据新华社北京三月二十九日电  （记者丁坚铭、实习生徐伟）中国人民银行提供的资料表明，目前我国货币回笼情况开始好转。截至三月二十八日，今年银行净回笼货币八点七三亿元，比去年同期多回笼七点六五亿元。至此，今年春节前投放到社会上的货币已全部回笼。
    由于今年春节比去年提前了十一天，在一般情况下，三月份货币回笼速度要比去年同期减缓，但今年到目前止，全国货币回笼保持了较好的势头。
    货币是国民经济的综合反映。一些行家据此认为，目前的货币回笼形势显示出全国治理、整顿工作已取得初步成效。据分析，货币回笼形势较好的主要原因是，今年以来市场平稳，物价上涨过猛的势头已被遏制，群众心理比较稳定；同时，商业部门大力组织商品供应，增加了商品的货币回笼。从二月一日起，国家再次调高了储蓄存款利率，储蓄存款增加较多。
