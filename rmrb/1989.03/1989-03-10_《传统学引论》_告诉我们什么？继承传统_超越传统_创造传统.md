What is tradition? Why does tradition become tradition? How does tradition occur and develop? What basic elements and structures does tradition include? What functions does tradition have? Many people are not very clear about these questions and need an independent discipline to systematically study them.

Professor Zhang Lìwén's "Introduction to Traditional Studies" (published by the People's University of China Press) treats tradition as an independent object of study and constructs traditional studies based on this, which is a new attempt. In this work, the author examines the relationship between tradition and culture, traditional studies and cultural studies, explores the principles and methods of constructing traditional studies, traces the historical process of the occurrence, development, destruction, and reconstruction of tradition, studies the value system, psychological temperament system, knowledge system, and language and literature system in the structure of tradition, as well as their synchronic and diachronic relationships. Finally, through a reflection on tradition, the author discusses the paths and significance of creating and constructing new traditions. These contents constitute the basic structure of this work.

Tradition, it seems, is a historical fact, something that has passed, something outside our reality. In fact, this is not the case. Any existing nation or state has its own tradition, and tradition exists within the reality of the nation and state. As a being with a sense of history, humans cannot ignore, let alone sever, the connection between tradition and reality in their lives and activities. The reality of us is shaped by both the present era and historical tradition. More precisely, we are shaped by the combined forces of the present era and historical tradition. Although we often want to break away from tradition due to some aversion, tradition is always influencing us, entangling us, seeping into our inner world and external behavior. We are always unconsciously placed within tradition and participate in its creation. Tradition shapes us, and we also shape tradition. This is the general relationship between us and tradition. Historically, the achievements of each era are preserved as a sacred link in the chain of tradition and passed down as a heritage to the next generation. Inheriting this heritage means mastering it and using it as a basis for new creation. In this way, the chain of tradition continuously leaps from one link to a richer and more expansive new link. Each new link is a new stage in the process of human cultural evolution with distinctive characteristics of the times, but it has not completely broken away from the historical trajectory of tradition. Therefore, tradition is not a stagnant, lifeless historical deposit, but a vibrant, ever-flowing stream that swells the farther it is from its source. Of course, in this stream, there are inevitably both mud and pearls sinking together, and both dross and essence flowing together. When a tradition is blocked at a turning point in an era and cannot surpass it, it may break off or even disappear. In this case, a new tradition with new vitality will form. At the same time, any tradition is not single or isolated. Through mutual penetration and fusion between different traditions, a richer and more expansive new tradition stream can be formed.

A person who has a high sense of responsibility and mission for history, reality, and the future should always stand at the junction of history and reality in the process of human cultural development, both inheriting tradition critically and surpassing it to push it to new heights, driving history and reality towards an ideal future.

Some people understand tradition only in a negative sense, while others understand it only in a positive sense. Both of these attitudes towards tradition do not conform to the logic inherent in the way human culture evolves. We cannot simply discard tradition as historical garbage; nor can we treat tradition as a sacred, inviolable idol and worship it devoutly. In tradition, there are both dross and essence, and we need to critically reflect, analyze, and sift through it, discarding the dross and absorbing the essence, making it ours and transforming it into a part of ourselves. Even those elements in tradition that have universal and permanent significance are often present in the form of omens, embryos, buds, and imperfect, immature forms, the closer they are to the source of tradition. Our inheritance and absorption of tradition is not simply taking it over, but rather, based on the characteristics of our own era, infusing it with new spirit of the times, giving it new attributes, meanings, and functions, so that it can develop, grow, and unfold, appearing in our real life in a mature and developed form. "Introduction to Traditional Studies" correctly points out that "tradition is the product of the mutual penetration and action of subject and object." From the perspective of the openness and eternity of the subject-object relationship, tradition can be said to be the accumulation of human creation (creation is the highest form of human subjectivity in handling the relationship between oneself and the object). This accumulation of creation is not additive, but a process full of metabolism. In this process, people, on the basis of critically inheriting the existing tradition, continuously enrich, enrich, and increase the components and factors of tradition with new creative achievements, even changing the original structure of tradition, making it a new tradition with a completely new form that adapts to the subject-object relationship of our era.

It is impossible to completely break away from or shake off the entanglement of tradition; continuing to think, live, and act according to traditional habits and methods without any change cannot move forward. This seems to be a dilemma that people often fall into psychologically.

Currently, a wave of cultural studies has risen in our country. This research has a very obvious critical nature, strongly impacting the established patterns and various pre-existing regulations of traditional Chinese culture. But this research also has a very obvious constructive nature, aiming to explore the path to building a modernized China or a socialist China with Chinese characteristics. Today's China is a continuation of traditional China. The reason China is China lies in its own historical tradition. We want to build a modernized China, to build a socialist China with Chinese characteristics. Of course, we need to achieve a transcendence of historical tradition, but we must also be constrained by historical tradition and cannot sever the connection with historical tradition. In the gradual period of history, people consciously or unconsciously think, live, and act according to traditional habits and methods, and do not feel that tradition has a sense of alien pressure. But in the period of drastic changes or transformations in history, people strongly feel the existence of tradition as an invisible force that entangles them.

How to transcend this dilemma regarding tradition? Professor Zhang Lìwén points out in "Introduction to Traditional Studies": "The way people transcend this dilemma is perhaps only to study it, research it, that is, to recognize it and master it, so as to utilize it." "Introduction to Traditional Studies" is the result of Professor Zhang Lìwén's study and research on tradition. According to the book's definition, the modern meaning of tradition is: "The organic system constituted by various forms of human-created qualities that are historically condensed and passed down, changing." Traditional studies are "the science that studies the laws of the occurrence and development of traditional phenomena and the mutual relationships between their various elements." To determine the "positive value orientation" and "negative content to be discarded" of tradition, to absorb the advanced and excellent achievements in tradition, to update the form and content of tradition, and to create new traditions, the author proposes the "analytical negation theory" and "synthetic creation theory." Based on the above definitions of tradition and traditional studies, and according to the theoretical principles of mastering and utilizing tradition, the author uses a wealth of materials to examine the various aspects, parts, links, and elements of the whole of this object from both macro and micro levels, and conducts detailed and specific analyses of the surface structure, deep structure, and overall structure of tradition. This examination and analysis are not only about general traditions but also, in particular, about Chinese traditions. At the same time, a deep comparative analysis is also conducted on the specific forms of Chinese traditions and Eastern and Western traditions. Regarding the synthetic creation of tradition, according to the author's opinion, it is to achieve the modernization of Chinese tradition that adapts to the modernization of China. The path is to analytically negate the Chinese tradition and broadly, actively absorb the excellent cultural achievements of various countries in the world, and create synthetically.

Examining and analyzing tradition is not to repeat the past traditions as they are, but to promote the transformation and transcendence of tradition through reflecting on tradition, and to create new traditions synthetically.

### 《传统学引论》——告诉我们什么？继承传统　超越传统　创造传统

　　《传统学引论
    ——告诉我们什么？
    继承传统　超越传统　创造传统
    夏甄陶
    什么是传统？传统之所以成为传统？传统是如何发生、发展的？传统包括哪些基本要素和具有什么样的结构？传统具有什么功能？等等，
    许多人不是很清楚，需要有一门独立学科来系统地研究。
    张立文教授的《传统学引论》（中国人民大学出版社出版）把传统作为一种独立的对象加以研究，并由此来建构传统学，这是一个新的尝试。在这一著作中，作者考察了传统与文化、传统学与文化学的关系，探讨了建构传统学的原则和方法，追溯了传统发生、发展、破坏和重建的历史过程，研究了传统结构中的价值观念系统、心理气质系统、知识系统和语言文学系统等要素以及它们之间的共时态与历时态的关系，最后通过对传统的反思，论述了创造和建构新传统的途径与意义。这些内容构成了这一著作的基本结构。
    所谓传统，看起来似乎是历史的事实，似乎是过去了的东西，似乎是在我们的现实以外，其实不然。任何一个现实存在的民族、国家都有自己的传统，而传统也存在于民族、国家的现实之中。人作为有历史感的存在物，在自己的生活和活动中，不能不顾、更不能割断传统和现实之间的联系。现实的我们，既是现实的时代造就的，又是历史的传统造就的，更确切地说，是现实的时代和历史的传统的合力造就的。尽管我们往往由于某种憎恶感而想摆脱传统，但传统无时无地不在影响着我们，纠缠着我们，渗进我们的内心世界和外部行为，而我们自己也总是不知不觉地置身于传统之中，并参与传统的创造。传统造就我们，我们也创就传统，这就是我们与传统的一般关系。历史地看，每个时代的人们所创获的成果，都作为传统的神圣的链子中的一环保存下来，并作为遗产传给下一代。继承这份遗产，也就是掌握这份遗产，并以此为定势，进行新的创造。这样，传统的链子就不断地从一个环节跃迁到一个更为丰富、更为庞大的新环节。这每一个新环节都是人类文化进化过程中的一个具有时代性特征的新阶段，但又没有完全脱离传统的历史轨迹。所以传统并不是静止不动的死寂的历史沉积物，而是一道生命洋溢的、永远流动的、离开它的源头愈远就膨胀得愈大的洪流。当然，在这道洪流中，总是不可避免地既有泥沙与珠玉齐沉，又有糟粕与精华俱下。而当某种传统受阻于某一时代的转折关头并无力超越时，它也可能因此而断流乃至消失。在这种情况下，又会形成具有新的生命力的传统。同时，任何一种传统都不是单一的、孤立的，在不同的传统之间通过相互渗透、相互汇合，也会形成更为丰富、更为庞大的新传统洪流。
    一个对历史、现实和未来具有高度责任感和使命感的人，应该时刻站在人类文化发展过程中历史和现实的联结点上，既扬弃地继承传统，又超越地将它推进到新的高峰，把历史和现实推向理想的未来。
    对于传统，有的人只是从否定的意义上来理解，有的人则只是从肯定的意义上来理解。这两种对待传统的态度，都不符合人类文化进化方式所固有的逻辑。我们既不能把传统当作历史的垃圾，简单地予以抛弃；也不能把传统当作神圣不可侵犯的偶像供奉起来，虔诚地对它顶礼膜拜。在传统中，既有糟粕，又有精华，需要我们经过批判性的反思加以辨析，筛汰其糟粕，吸收其精华，使它们成为我们所有，转变成为我们自己的一部分。即使是传统中那些具有普遍性意义和永久性意义的精华，也往往是以征兆、胚胎、萌芽和不完善、不成熟的形式存在着，离传统的源头越近就越是这样。我们继承、吸收传统，决不是简单地拿过来，而是要根据我们自己时代的特点，注入新的时代精神，赋予它们以新的特性、意义和功能，使它们得到发育、成长、展开，以成熟、发达的形式出现在我们的现实生活中。《传统学引论》认为“传统是主客体相互渗透、作用的产物”，这是很正确的。从主客体关系的开放性和永恒性这个角度看，传统可以说是人的创造（创造是人作为主体处理自己同客体的关系的最高形式）的积累。这种创造的积累不是叠加式的，而是一个充满新陈代谢的过程。在这个过程中，人们在扬弃地继承先在的传统的基础上，不断以新的创造成果来充实、丰富、增加传统的成分、因素，甚至改变传统的原有结构，使之成为具有崭新形态的与我们时代的主客体关系相适应的新传统。
    完全彻底地摆脱或甩掉传统的纠缠是不可能的；毫无改变地继续按照传统的习惯、方式来思维、生活、活动又不能前进。这似乎是人们心理上常常陷入的两难困境。
    当前，在我国兴起了一股文化研究的热潮。这种研究具有十分明显的批判性，它猛烈地冲击着我国传统文化的固有模式和各种先在的规定。但这种研究又具有十分明显的建设性，其目的在于探索建设现代化中国或具有中国特色的社会主义的途径。今天的中国是由传统的中国延续来的。中国之所以是中国，在于它有自己的历史传统。我们要建设现代化的中国，要建设具有中国特色的社会主义，固然要实现对历史传统的超越，但又必然要受历史传统的制约，不能斩断同历史传统的联系。在历史的渐进时期，人们有意识或无意识地按照传统的习惯、方式来思维、生活、活动，并不觉得传统有一种异在的压迫感。但在历史的剧烈变动或转变时期，人们就强烈地感到传统作为一种无形地纠缠着自己的异己力量的存在。
    如何超越这个对待传统的困境呢？张立文教授在《传统学引论》中指出：“人们超越这种困境的办法，或许只有探讨它、研究它，也就是说只有认识它、掌握它，才能利用它”。《传统学引论》就是张立文教授探讨、研究传统所取得的成果。按照本书的规定，传统的现代涵义是：“人类创造的不同形态的特质经由历史凝聚而沿传着、流变着的诸文化因素构成的有机系统”。而传统学就是“研究传统现象发生、发展的规律及其各要素之间相互关系的科学”。为了确定“传统的正面价值取向”和“负面内涵舍弃”，为了吸收传统中先进的、优秀的成果，更新传统的形式和内容，开创出新传统，本书作者提出了“分析扬弃论”和“综合创造论”。根据上述关于传统和传统学的规定，按照上述掌握和利用传统的理论原则，作者运用十分丰富的资料，从宏观和微观两个层次对传统这个对象整体的各个方面、部分、环节、要素作了纵向和横向的考察，并对传统的表层结构、深层结构和整体结构作了细致具体的分析。这种考察和分析不仅仅是关于一般传统的，而且特别是关于中国传统的。同时还对中国传统和东方的、西方的具体形态的传统作了深入的比较分析。对于传统的综合创造，按照本书作者的意见，就是要实现与中国的现代化相适应的中国传统的现代化。其途径是在分析地扬弃中国传统的基础上，广泛地、积极地吸收世界各国的优秀文化成果，进行综合地创造。
    考察、分析传统，不是为了原封不动地去重复以往的传统，而是要通过反思传统，促使传统的变革和超越，综合地创造新的传统。
