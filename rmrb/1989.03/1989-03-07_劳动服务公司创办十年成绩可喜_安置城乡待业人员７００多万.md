Labor service companies have achieved remarkable success in their ten years of operation, placing over 7 million urban and rural unemployed individuals.

The People's Daily, Zuzhou, March 5th - Reporter Wu Xinghua reports: From the national labor service company work conference and the Chinese Labor Service Company Research Association meeting held in Hunan Province's Zuzhou City, it is learned that China's labor service companies have made significant contributions to society over the past ten years.

This year marks the tenth anniversary of the establishment of labor service companies in China.

Labor service companies have made important contributions to the development of the national economy:

- They have implemented the state's policy of combining national job allocation, organizing laborers for employment, and laborers seeking jobs on their own, known as the "three-in-one" employment policy. Currently, there are 56,000 labor service companies of various levels and types nationwide. They are spread throughout cities and towns and have extended to rural areas, forming a network for organizing and managing social labor forces.

- They have implemented the strategic decision to develop the collective economy, paving a way for unemployed individuals to rely on themselves rather than the state, transforming passive unemployment into actively creating employment opportunities. Nationwide, there are 230,000 production and service outlets under labor service companies, employing over 7 million people, becoming an important force in China's urban collective economy.

- They have adapted to China's labor surplus situation, serving as a "reservoir" to absorb and regulate social labor forces. Currently, there are 1,600 employment training centers under labor service companies, providing 5 million qualified laborers to production departments and enterprises in urgent need of labor.

　　劳动服务公司创办十年成绩可喜
    安置城乡待业人员７００多万
    本报株洲３月５日电  记者吴兴华报道：记者从正在湖南省株洲市召开的全国劳动服务公司工作会议暨中国劳动服务公司研究会理事会议了解到：我国劳动服务公司创办１０年来，为社会作出了重大贡献。
    今年，是我国劳动服务公司创办１０周年。
    劳动服务公司为国民经济的发展，作出了重要贡献：
    ——组织实施国家分配就业、将劳动者组织起来就业和劳动者自谋职业结合的“三结合”就业方针，全国各级各类劳动服务公司到目前已发展到５．６万所。遍布城镇并向乡村延伸，形成对社会劳动力进行组织管理的工作网络。
    ——落实发展集体经济的战略决策，走出了一条待业人员不靠国家靠自己，变消极待业为积极开辟就业条件的创业式的就业道路。全国的劳动服务公司已有生产和服务网点２３万个，从业人员已达到７００多万人，成为我国城镇集体经济中一支重要的生力军。
    ——适应我国劳动力供大于求的国情，发挥储备和调节吞吐社会劳动力的“蓄水池”作用。劳动服务公司的就业训练中心，目前已发展到１６００个，向社会急需劳动力的生产部门、企业提供了５００万合格的劳动者。
