	Over the past decade, Australian literature has been steadily developing. In 1972, Australia published only 19 novels in a year, but by 1986, this number had risen to 200. In 1974, only 1,615 books were published, while in 1985, this number increased to 3,570. According to statistics, Australia's per capita book purchasing rate has surpassed that of Britain and the United States.

	Meanwhile, literature has become increasingly popular among the masses. Australians are increasingly fond of reading books by their own countrymen and yearn to meet their own writers. Thus, many literary festivals have emerged across the country. For example, in Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide, there are writers' weeks, and in Perth, there is a literature festival. Each of these events attracts tens of thousands of participants. The writers' week in Adelaide is held outdoors, with enthusiastic audiences facing the rolling waves of the sea, listening to writers recite their works under the scorching sun. Nearby tents sell novels, plays, and poetry. The distance between readers and writers has narrowed, and their hearts have merged.

	The Australian government has taken numerous measures to promote the prosperity of the literary industry. The Australian Arts Council, which oversees this work, strives to improve the living and working conditions of writers. It provides writers with grants and travel expenses, solves housing problems, and secures pensions for writers over the age of 55. In recent years alone, poets such as Adamson, Wright, and Tranter have each received six or seven grants.

	Australian writers enjoy publishing in the United States, considering it a mark of success. To this end, the Australian Arts Council supports American publishers who publish Australian books. Currently, 10 Australian writers' works have become bestsellers in the United States, including the female poet Judith Wright's "The Double Tree." The Australian Arts Council has secured some American editors to publish more Australian works through them. It has also hired a critic in New York to write articles introducing Australian literature in major newspapers and magazines. Additionally, it sends writers to attend various international conferences and visit and lecture abroad. These activities have expanded the influence of Australian literature around the world.

	Due to the increased sales of their books both domestically and internationally, and the protection of the government, Australian writers enjoy a comfortable life. Some professional writers have already emerged. Poet Les Murray said, "This protection system is good. Writers have not become appendages of the state. We still loyally dedicate our pens to the people." Many visiting foreign writers envy the favorable conditions of their Australian counterparts.

　　澳大利亚对文学的保护
    近十多年来，澳大利亚的文学在稳步发展。１９７２年，澳大利亚全年只出版１９部小说，而１９８６年仅一年就出版了２００部。１９７４年只出书１６１５种，１９８５年多达３５７０种，据统计，澳大利亚的人均购书量已超过英国和美国。
    与此同时，文学在群众中日益普及。澳大利亚人愈来愈爱读本国的书，渴望会见本国作家。于是，许多文学节日在全国各地应运而生。例如，在悉尼、布里斯班和阿得雷德有作家周，在佩思有文学节。参加这些活动的人每次多达两三万。阿得雷德的作家周是在露天举行的，热情的听众面对着波涛滚滚的大海，在灼热的阳光下静听着作家们朗诵自己的作品。附近的帐篷里出售着小说、戏剧和诗歌等文学书籍。读者和作家间的距离缩小了，他们的心交融在一起。
    澳大利亚政府采取许多措施促进文学事业的繁荣。掌管这项工作的澳大利亚文化委员会努力改善作家的生活和创作条件，它为作家发放奖金和旅游费，解决住宅问题，还为年逾５５岁的作家取得养老金。仅最近几年，诗人亚当逊、格雷、特朗特尔等每人都获得了六七笔奖金。
    澳大利亚作家喜欢在美国出书，把这当作成功的标志。为此，澳大利亚文化委员会资助那些出版澳大利亚书籍的美国书商。目前已有１０位澳大利亚作家的著作成为美国畅销书，其中包括女诗人朱迪斯·赖特的《双行树》。澳大利亚文化委员会争取到一些美国编辑，通过他们多刊载澳大利亚作品，它还在纽约雇用了一位评论家，在各大报刊撰文介绍澳大利亚文学。此外，它还派遣作家出席各种国际会议，到国外访问讲学。这些活动扩大了澳大利亚文学在世界上的影响。
    由于他们的书在国内外销数剧增，又得到政府的保护，澳大利亚作家过着优裕的生活。已经出现了一些专业作家。诗人勒·穆莱说：“这种保护制度是好的，作家并没有因此成为国家的附庸。我们仍在把自己的笔忠诚地奉献给人民。”许多来访的外国作家都很羡慕澳大利亚同行的优越境遇。
