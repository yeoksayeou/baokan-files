The Seventh Standing Committee of the National People's Congress attaches great importance to maintaining regular contact with deputies and regards this as the foundation for its work.

The Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress arranges inspection work for deputies before meetings and, together with relevant departments, holds a national conference to exchange experiences in handling deputies' proposals and CPPCC members' motions. The conference emphasizes that the whole society should respect the democratic rights of deputies, and that state organs should handle deputies' proposals seriously and provide high-quality services to enable deputies to exercise their powers in accordance with the law, making deputies' work institutionalized and legalized. During the legislative process, the Standing Committee prints some draft laws and circulates them among deputies to solicit their opinions; deputies also consult the public on draft laws.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has also established a reception room for deputies from around the country to listen to their suggestions, criticisms, and opinions regarding the work, and to collect information from deputies.

To provide services for deputies to fulfill their duties, the Office of the Standing Committee, in consultation with relevant departments, has decided that starting from March 1, 1989, deputies of the National People's Congress will be able to purchase train, bus, ship, and airplane tickets in advance when performing their duties as deputies, by presenting their deputy certificates.

　　全国人大常委会多方努力
    保障人民代表履行职责
    本报北京３月１４日讯  七届全国人大常委会重视同人大代表的经常联系，并把这作为做好常委会工作的基础。
    人大常委会办公厅及时安排代表们的会前视察工作，并会同有关部门召开全国办理人大代表建议、政协委员提案工作经验交流会，强调全社会都要尊重人大代表的民主权利，国家机关认真办理代表建议并要为代表依法行使职权提供高质量的服务，使代表工作制度化、法律化。常委会在立法过程中，将一些法律草案印发代表，征求代表的意见；代表们带着法律草案征求群众的意见。
    全国人大常委会还设立了全国人大代表接待室，听取来访代表对工作的建议、批评和意见，收集来自代表的信息。
    为了为代表履行职责提供服务，常委会办公厅同有关部门商定，从今年３月１日起，全国人大代表执行代表职务时，凭代表证可优先购买火车票、汽车票、轮船票、飞机票。　　　　　（段存章　韩培梅）
