On March 11, the Central United Front Work Department hosted a meeting, inviting leaders from various democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, along with leaders from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supervision Bureau. The meeting discussed the establishment of a reporting system by democratic parties and the Federation, the conduct of reporting work, the exchange of information, and the exploration of cooperation methods. Specific measures and steps were also clarified.

Last October, Zhao Ziyang suggested at a meeting with non-Party personnel that democratic parties should establish a reporting system to participate in the supervision of the Communist Party and state organs in overcoming and rectifying corruption. Various democratic parties and the Federation responded positively and conducted preliminary discussions and research.

Participants in the March 11 meeting believed that the establishment of a reporting system by democratic parties and the Federation to participate in the supervision of the Communist Party and state organs in overcoming and rectifying corruption is an important step in improving the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party and in enabling democratic parties to play a role in democratic supervision. It is also an important measure for democratic parties to participate in the rectification of the economic environment and economic order, and to contribute to the country's clean governance.

Leaders from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supervision Bureau warmly welcomed and actively supported the democratic parties and the Federation in conducting reporting work. They expressed that they would handle the received reporting materials seriously and ensure that each case has a follow-up. Leaders from the democratic parties and the Federation also expressed that they would actively play a role in democratic supervision and strengthen their contact with supervisory and judicial departments in the future to jointly promote clean governance.

　　赵紫阳提议　多部门共商
    民主党派建举报制度
    参与监督中共和政府
    据新华社北京三月十六日电  三月十一日，由中央统战部主持，邀请各民主党派中央、全国工商联有关负责人，与中共中央纪律检查委员会、最高人民检察院、最高人民法院、监察部等有关方面负责人举行座谈会，就民主党派、工商联建立举报制度、开展举报工作，进行磋商，沟通情况，探讨彼此之间如何协作，并明确了有关的具体办法和措施。
    去年十月，赵紫阳在党外人士座谈会上，建议民主党派建立举报制度，参加对中共和国家机关克服和纠正腐败现象的监督工作。各民主党派、工商联积极响应，进行了酝酿和研究。
    参加十一日座谈的人士认为，民主党派、工商联建立举报制度，参加对中共和国家机关克服和纠正腐败现象的监督工作，是完善共产党领导的多党合作制度和民主党派发挥民主监督作用的一个重要步骤，也是民主党派参加治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序工作，为国家廉政建设贡献力量的一个重要措施。
    中纪委、高检、高法、监察部的人士，热诚欢迎和积极支持民主党派、工商联开展举报工作，并表示将认真负责地处理受理的举报材料，做到件件有着落。民主党派、工商联的人士也表示，要积极发挥民主监督作用，今后将加强同监察、司法部门的联系，共同推进廉政建设。
