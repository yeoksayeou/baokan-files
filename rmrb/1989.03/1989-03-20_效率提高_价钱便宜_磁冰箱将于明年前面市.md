	Efficiency Improved, Price Reduced
	Magnetic Refrigerators to Hit Market Next Year

	Xinhua News Agency, London, March 17

	According to a report by the Financial Times, a completely new type of magnetic refrigerator will be launched by 1990. Compared to conventional refrigerators, it is 25% cheaper and 40 times more efficient.

	The newspaper predicts that a new industry for manufacturing magnetic refrigerators will quickly emerge, replacing the existing refrigerator industry.

	The working principle of the magnetic refrigerator is based on the magnetocaloric effect. Some materials, when placed in a changing magnetic field, can generate a temperature gradient.

	In addition to magnetic refrigerators, new types of air conditioners and inexpensive liquid hydrogen can also be produced using the magnetocaloric cooling method.

	The magnetic refrigerator was invented by American scientists. It will certainly be welcomed by environmentalists because it does not use chlorofluorocarbons during operation. Chlorofluorocarbons are chemicals that damage the ozone layer.

　　效率提高　价钱便宜
    磁冰箱将于明年前面市
    新华社伦敦３月１７日电  据《金融时报》报道，一种完全新式的磁冰箱将于１９９０年前上市。它同常规冰箱比较，价钱便宜四分之一，效率提高４０倍。
    这家报纸预言，制造磁冰箱的新工业将会很快建立起来，以替代现有的冰箱工业。
    磁冰箱的工作原理是根据磁热效应，有些材料处于变化磁场中时能够产生温度梯度。
    除了磁冰箱外，还可以用磁热致冷法生产新型的空调机和价格低廉的液氢。
    磁冰箱是美国科学家发明的。它肯定会受到环境保护者的欢迎，因为它工作时不用氯氟烃。氯氟烃是破坏臭氧层的化学物质。
