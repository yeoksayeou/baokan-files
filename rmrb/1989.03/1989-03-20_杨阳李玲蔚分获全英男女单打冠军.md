In the second set, Yang Yang won 15-7, thus reclaiming his dominance from two years ago when he defeated Frost at the World Championships.

In the first set, Susanti initially led 7-1, but Li Lingwei remained calm and quickly turned the tables, controlling the match. She used clever feints to score points, defeating her opponent in 31 minutes and securing the women's singles title.

　　杨阳李玲蔚分获全英男女单打冠军
    本报伦敦３月１９日电  记者陈特安报道：中国羽毛球选手杨阳、李玲蔚分别获得１９８９年全英羽毛球公开赛男女单打冠军。
    杨阳仅以３７分钟战胜丹麦名将莫滕·弗罗斯特，荣获男子单打冠军。　　弗罗斯特是此项目的四次冠军保持者。据外电称，在历次全英羽毛球赛中，弗罗斯特“从未受到过杨阳的挑战”，只是在一次混合双打中，杨阳和同伴曾战胜过他。
    杨阳以１５∶６赢了第一局，形成对弗罗斯特的强大压力。弗罗斯特随即连连失误，甚至出现许多“基本错误”，并为此付出高昂代价。第二局中，杨阳以１５∶７一举夺魁，从而再显两年前在世界锦标赛上战胜弗罗斯特的雄风。
    李玲蔚以１１∶８和１１∶４战胜印尼选手、世界青年羽毛球锦标赛冠军苏希·苏姗蒂。在第一局中，苏姗蒂开始以７∶１领先，但李玲蔚沉着冷静很快扳回，并控制了局面，最后她以巧妙的假动作连连得分，以３１分钟战胜对手，荣登女单冠军宝座。
