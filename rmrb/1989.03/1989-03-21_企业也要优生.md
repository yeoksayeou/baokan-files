Title: Enterprises Also Need to Practice Selective Breeding

It is indeed a strange phenomenon: a certain city has over sixty factories assembling refrigerators! Is a refrigerator like a metal teapot that can be hammered out with a few blows? Is a refrigerator factory like a blacksmith's shop that can open for business just by setting up a forge? No, a refrigerator is a refrigerator! This item cannot be taken lightly.

Over sixty factories sprang up overnight, inevitably leading to substandard products flooding the market, causing consumers to suffer.

What is worth pondering is that two years ago, when this city had over thirty refrigerator manufacturing factories, an economic expert warned that there were too many and measures should be taken. Some people did not take this seriously, saying that free competition and survival of the fittest should be allowed, why bother interfering! As a result, two years later, the number had grown to over sixty.

In theory, survival of the fittest is a necessary outcome of market competition. For a hot-selling product, it is not frightening if many producers rush to produce it at the same time. In fierce competition, enterprises with small production volumes, poor quality, and low efficiency will be eliminated, while those with large production volumes, good quality, and high efficiency will develop, and even superior enterprises will absorb inferior ones. However, why do enterprises with advantageous products and a promising future often fail to win out, while those with disadvantaged products fail to be eliminated?

The problem lies in the fact that the market mechanism is not yet perfect, and many non-market factors seriously affect the development of the market. For example, under the fiscal system of separate accounts, local governments, in order to achieve economic benefits, will inevitably compete for hot-selling products. Even if the management is poor and the benefits are low, they will still provide support to prevent bankruptcy. In such places, mergers and acquisitions between enterprises are difficult, and production factors are hard to mobilize. Moreover, our economy is also a shortage economy. Many products are seller's markets, and some hot-selling products, although of poor quality and high price, can still be sold, and their producing enterprises can still survive.

The establishment of enterprises producing hot-selling products should emphasize "selective breeding," that is, the state should formulate scientific industrial policies and unified plans, based on which to conduct bidding competitions, comprehensive balancing, and select the best to determine the production points. Economic and administrative measures should be taken to limit the sudden surge in production, repeated construction, and repeated introduction, so that limited funds and resources are used in enterprises that can best generate benefits, making these enterprises move from selective breeding to winning out in competition.

To improve the quality of the Chinese people, population control cannot lack selective breeding. To modernize Chinese industry, enterprises also cannot lack "selective breeding."

　　企业也要优生
    皮子
    真是奇闻：某个城市竟有六十多家组装冰箱的工厂！莫非冰箱是洋铁壶，几把榔头，就能敲打出来？莫非冰箱厂是铁匠铺，支一架烘炉就能开张？不，冰箱就是冰箱！这玩艺一点含糊不得。
    六十多家工厂一轰而起，少不了滥竽充数的，一时这些厂家组装的劣质冰箱到处泛滥，消费者叫苦不迭。
    值得深思的是，两年前，当这个城市冒出三十多家生产冰箱的工厂时，一位经济专家曾警告说太多了，应该采取措施，有人不以为然，说自由竞争，优胜劣汰，何必多操心！结果，两年后竟发展到六十多家。
    按理说，优胜劣汰是市场竞争的必然结果。某种热门产品，一时群雄并起，竞相生产，也没什么可怕。在激烈的竞争中，批量小、质量差、效益低的企业会被淘汰，批量大、质量好、效益高的企业则会发展，甚至优势企业吃掉劣势企业。可是，为什么产品有优势、有前途的企业往往优而不胜，而产品处于劣势的企业劣而不汰呢？
    问题在于，目前市场机制还不健全，许多非市场因素严重影响着市场的发育。比如说，在财政分灶的体制下，地方为实现经济利益，必然要争上热门产品，即使经营不善，效益不好，也在那里输血打气，使其免于破产。在这样的地方，企业间的兼并困难重重，生产要素难于流动。再说，我们的经济也是短缺的经济，许多产品是卖方市场，有些热门产品虽然质次价高，也能卖得出去，其生产企业也能混得下去。
    热门产品企业的上马应当讲究“优生”，即国家制定科学的产业政策和统一规划，据此实行招标竞争，综合平衡，择优定点，采取经济的、行政的手段，限制一轰而起，重复建设，重复引进，使有限的资金、资源用于最能发挥效益的企业，使这些企业在竞争中从优生走向优胜。
    为了提高中华民族的素质，人口不能没有优生，为了中国工业的现代化，企业也不能没有“优生”。
