Beijing. March 25. The gentle spring breeze rustles the willow branches, and the tips begin to show green. The bustling construction site of the Dadu Hotel expansion project in Chegongzhuang has fallen silent. The tall tower cranes have stopped moving, and 600 construction workers have left the site... The much-watched "Dadu" project has finally ceased construction.

Two days earlier, a deputy secretary of the municipal government arrived at "Dadu" with an official document, announcing that they had received a formal notice from the State Council's project rectification leading group and the State Planning Commission: "Starting immediately, halt construction and complete the follow-up work."

That night, concrete work was completed; the next morning at 8 AM, structural engineering work ceased. A few hundred construction workers remained to clean up inside and outside the building and to protect the construction site, while the rest left the site. The person in charge of the hotel's construction expressed their determination to strictly implement the requirements of the _Notice_, ensuring that "orders must be obeyed, prohibitions must be stopped."

Nearby residents are most concerned about why this expansion project, with an investment of over 100 million yuan, three underground floors, 15 above-ground floors, and a construction area of nearly 38,000 square meters, only completed 10% of the work by last October, and why it was only now officially listed for suspension?

An informed source who wished to remain anonymous said that this issue first reflects the difficulty of rectification and adjustment. Clearing ongoing projects and reducing investment scales is no easy task. He said:

Despite the initial clearing of Beijing's office buildings, there were numerous public complaints about this project, with calls to immediately suspend it never ceasing;

Despite the media repeatedly urging it to cool down and change its tune;

Despite the notice from Zhongnanhai that "nine types of projects must be suspended by January 10th" clearly stating that there is no room for negotiation;

Despite the State Council's inspection team having numerous discussions with the relevant responsible parties of this project, urging and suggesting that it be halted.

They still insisted on using the excuse of "treating it as a foreign-funded project" and continued to push forward towards the goal of completing the project by the end of this year, working day and night.

Another informed source added: "From mid-October last year, the Dadu expansion project's progress was at the 3-layer reinforced concrete frame stage. By the end of the year, the frame had risen to 8 layers, and recently, one corner of the 13th layer has emerged, with the speed of progress astonishing everyone.

In addition, there were various opinions, arguments, and other reasons:

To build a first-class international hotel; funds and materials are guaranteed; the borrowed foreign exchange must be considered for repayment by the state; there are also micro-economic benefits, meso-level interests... and so on, and so on.

However, rectification and adjustment must be resolute, clearing projects and reducing scales must be carried out to the end, and the authority of the central government and the State Council must be maintained. The relevant officials from the state departments revealed to the reporter that the Dadu expansion project was recently listed as a special topic in the State Council's project rectification leading group meeting. The meeting confirmed that "Dadu" should not be considered a Sino-foreign joint venture project but should be one of the projects that need to be suspended.

This experienced expert deeply felt that due to the intertwining of awareness issues, interest issues, and certain practical issues, clearing projects and reducing scales require a process, which is understandable. However, this process should be shortened as much as possible. And the key lies in the leadership at all levels.

### “令必行，禁必止”——大都饭店扩建工程停工前后

　　“令必行，禁必止”        
    ——大都饭店扩建工程停工前后
    本报记者  鲁牧
    北京。３月２５日。春风徐徐，柳梢吐绿。
    喧闹的车公庄大都饭店扩建工程工地沉寂下来，高高的塔吊停止了转动，６００名建筑工人撤离工地……众人瞩目的“大都”工程，终于停止施工了。
    两天前，市人民政府一位副秘书长带着“红头文件”来“大都”宣布，已接到国务院清理项目领导小组和国家计委的正式通知：“从即日起立即停工，并做好善后工作。”
    当夜，混凝土作业收尾；翌晨８时停止结构工程作业；留下二三百名施工工人做些室内外清理和工程防护，其余全部离开现场。饭店筹建处负责人表示，坚决贯彻执行《通知》要求，做到“令必行，禁必止”。
    近邻百姓最关注的则是，这项投资１亿多元、地下３层地上１５层、建筑面积近３．８万平方米的扩建工程，去年１０月完成工作量仅仅占总投资１０％多一点，为何今天才正式上了停缓建名单？
    一位不愿透露自己姓氏的知情者答曰，这个问题首先反映了治理整顿的艰巨性，清理在建项目、压缩投资规模谈何容易。他说：
    尽管清理北京地区楼堂馆所伊始，对该项目的群众举报纷至沓来，呼吁立即停缓之声不绝于耳；
    尽管新闻传播媒介一再敦促其降温、更弦；
    尽管中南海发出“９类项目１月１０日前先停后清”的通知已明确到不许再讨价还价的地步；
    尽管国务院清查工作组与该项目有关负责人士十数次谈话动员、建议下马。
    而他们始终以“视同外资项目”为由置之度外，依然朝着今年年底竣工的目标，日夜抢工挺进。
    另一位知情者补充道：“大都”扩建工程由去年１０月中旬的形象进度为３层混凝土结构框架，到年底结构框架升至８层，最近又冒出１３层的１角，进度之速令人瞠目。
    此外，还有诸如此类的观点、论调和别的原因：
    要搞个第一流的涉外饭店；资金、材料均有把握；借来的大量外汇国家总得考虑偿还；还有微观效益，中观利益……等等，等等。
    可是，治理整顿必须坚定不移，清理项目、压缩规模必须进行到底，中央、国务院的权威必须维护，该下的项目必须停缓。国家有关部门负责人向记者透露说，“大都”扩建工程项目不久前被列为国务院清理项目领导小组会议的一项专题。会议确认，“大都”不应属中外合资项目，而属应该停缓建的项目之一。
    这位资历不浅的专家深有感触地表露，由于认识问题、利益问题和某些实际问题交织在一起，清理项目、压缩规模需要有个过程，这是可以理解的。但是，这个过程应当争取尽可能的缩短。而其关键就在于各级领导。
