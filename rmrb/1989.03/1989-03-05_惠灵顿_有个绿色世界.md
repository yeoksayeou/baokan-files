Wellington has a green world. The botanical garden in New Zealand's Wellington is uniquely charming, with two distinct features: it is green, and it is full of flowers.

Perhaps no botanical garden in the world is not green, but few can be as lush, as deep, and as richly green as Wellington's. The garden is situated on a V-shaped ridge, encompassing 26 hectares of land, including the valley nestled within the hills. Upon entering the gate, you are immediately enveloped in a cool, quiet, green atmosphere. The slopes ahead, the grassy areas beside you, the towering pines, and the low shrubs—all are green. If you venture down the winding paths or climb the winding mountain trails, the greenery becomes even more intense. Above, tall trees block out the sky, while hidden plants brush against your clothes and sleeves. Below, the grass is thick and the moss slippery, and the water at the bottom of the valley flows gently. You will immediately feel as though you have entered a green world. Wellington has a small temperature difference between the seasons, and the trees are evergreen year-round. Although the botanical garden also experiences the blooming and falling of flowers and the sprouting and withering of leaves, the green never fades. Moreover, the greenery here does not feel monotonous. There is the deep blue-green of ancient pines, the light green of young elms and willows, the dense green of palm trees and ferns, the fresh green of azaleas and magnolias, the cool green of moss, the scorching green of cacti, and the heart-soothing green of the grasslands.

The flowers in Wellington's botanical garden are also intoxicating. The abundance, beauty, and exuberance of the flowers here are unlike anything I have seen elsewhere. Roses, plum blossoms, red spireas, marigolds, iris, and camellias bloom in clusters in various flower beds, creating a scene of beauty beyond description. Along the paths and on the slopes grow strange flowers: some resemble a small, dark red box with a delicate hand emerging from the center, as if greeting you; others look like a string of blue bells, gently ringing in the wind; still others resemble a silver pompom, hidden among dense green leaves; and some have petals that look like leaves, and if it were not for the clear red flowers among the green leaves, you would never guess that the vibrant ones were flowers. The stone crevices on the slopes are filled with various cacti, their branches competing in beauty, making it hard to believe that the flowers come from such unremarkable, dry green stems. The garden is most famous for its roses, with over 500 varieties, blooming for eight months of the year. When in full bloom, they are a riot of colors and their fragrance fills the air! The most beautiful, however, are the tulips, with 13 varieties. Every early spring, the tulips raise their cups filled with dew, and the people of Wellington will flock to admire them, with purple paths and red dust, and crowds of visitors, making it the busiest time of the year.

One reason why this botanical garden is so beautiful, I believe, is its inclusivity. It is difficult to count exactly how many types of trees and flowers are in the garden. Moreover, it is like an international garden, with famous trees and flowers from almost every country in the world. There are Chinese camellias, French roses, Brazilian coral trees, Argentine "devil's hand," Canary Island date palms, Australian beech trees, Norfolk pines, African cedars, North American ginkgo trees, Dutch tulips, and many varieties of Japanese cherry blossoms. Of course, the people of Wellington do not belittle themselves, and the most numerous in the garden are the native New Zealand pines, cypresses, elms, willows, and ferns. If you pay attention to the plant labels, you can quickly list a long series of country names. It is precisely because of the many plants from different countries, climates, and soils that the garden can remain green in summer and winter, with flowers on the hills and in the valleys, competing in beauty and vying for admiration.

The garden is so beautiful that it is no wonder the people of Wellington cherish it. On weekends, people come here to relax, strolling along the mountain paths or admiring the flowers by the garden ponds. Lovers cuddle among the flowers, and old couples sit idly under the trees; many families find a patch of green grass for a picnic. The sun is warm, the evening breeze is gentle, the dogs are happy, and the children laugh. The trees whisper, and the flowers emit a faint fragrance, truly a joyous scene. But they not only enjoy the botanical garden; they also deeply cherish it. Just two points are enough to prove this: the garden is lush with flowers and leaves, but you will never see a visitor plucking a green leaf or a fresh flower; there are 16,000 tulips, with about 30,000 flowers, and at their peak, visitors flock to see them, lingering and reluctant to leave, with the sound of cameras never ceasing, but from the time the flowers bloom until they wilt, no one steals them. The second point is the visitors' maintenance of cleanliness. Whether you are walking on the winding mountain paths or the flat flower paths, or whether you are in the courtyards or pavilions, you will almost never see any trash left by visitors. After a picnic on the grass, no paper or bottles will be left behind. On Sunday evenings, after the visitors have left, if you are interested in taking a stroll, you will see a botanical garden that is as clean as ever. Indeed, only with the presence of people with beautiful hearts can the botanical garden bloom with its most beautiful smile.

　　惠灵顿　有个绿色世界
    科兰
    新西兰的惠灵顿植物园别具风光，它有两个特点：一是绿；二是花。
    天下的植物园大概没有不绿的，但像惠灵顿植物园绿得这样浓密、这样深沉、这样丰富的，不一定很多。植物园座落在一道Ｖ字形的山岭上，连同山怀抱中的谷地，一共２６公顷。走进大门，一种凉森森、静悄悄的绿色气氛立刻把你包容起来。前方山坡，身边草地，高挺松柏，低矮灌木，无一不是绿。要是你踅进弯弯的甬路，或登上曲折的山间小径，那绿意更浓。头上有高大的树木遮蔽了天空，身旁有藏蕤的植物拂衣牵袖，脚下草厚苔滑，谷底流水琮琮，你会立刻觉得进入了一个绿色的世界。惠灵顿四季温差很小，树木终年常绿。植物园中虽然也有花开花落，叶萌叶凋，但那绿色是从不消褪。而且这里的绿不会使人感到单调，有老松古柏的深苍，有幼榆新柳的浅碧，有棕榈和蕨树的浓绿，有杜鹃和玉兰的新翠，苔藓绿得阴凉，仙人掌绿得滚烫，草地则绿得人心怡神旷。
    惠灵顿植物园的花也是令人陶醉的。这里花的多、花的美和花的奔放，是我在别处从未见过的。月季、海棠、串红、金盏、菖莆、山茶，在各处的花坛里一丛一丛地盛开得如簇锦攒秀，美不胜收。在小路边山坡上长着奇妙的花：有的花形如一个暗红色的小方盒，中间却纤纤地探出一只小手来，仿佛在向你致意；有的像一串蓝色的铃铛，风中似乎正悠悠振响；有的如同一团银色的绣球，掩映在浓浓的绿叶之中；有的花瓣则和叶儿一样，若不是绿叶中分明地托出那簇簇红叶来，你决不会想到那艳艳的竟是花的。山坡的石缝中长满了各种仙人掌，枝枝竞艳，使你几乎无法相信那花竟是从那毫不惊人的干涩的绿色中开出来的。植物园最盛的是玫瑰，那一园玫瑰有５００多个品种，一年连开８个月，花盛时五色缤纷，幽香袭人！最美的则要数郁金香，这里有１３个品种。每到早春，郁金香擎起了盛满朝露的玉杯，惠灵顿人会倾城而出，前来赏花，紫陌红尘，游人如织，是一年中最热闹的时光。
    这座植物园之所以如此美，有一点我想是很重要的，那就是它的兼收并蓄。植物园里究竟有多少种树木和花卉，大概很难数得清。而且这里犹如一个国际性花园，世界各国的名树名花这里几乎都有。有中国的山茶，法国的月季，巴西的珊瑚树，阿根廷的“魔鬼之手”，加那利群岛的凤凰树，澳大利亚的毛榉，诺福克的枞树，非洲的雪松，北美的鹅掌楸，荷兰的郁金香，以及好多种颜色的日本樱花。当然，惠灵顿人也绝不妄自菲薄，园中最多的还是新西兰土生的松、柏、榆、柳、蕨等。你如果留心看那植物的名牌，一会儿便可数出一大串国名来的。正是因为有如此之多的来自不同国度、不同气候、不同土壤的花木，植物园才能夏也常绿，冬也常绿，岭也有花，谷也有花，争奇斗艳，竞秀媲美。
    植物园这样美，难怪惠灵顿人会钟爱它，每到周末，人们便来这里休息，或散步于山间幽径，或赏花于庭园池畔，恋人们花间相偎，老夫妻林下闲坐；也有许多人家，找一隅茵茵草地野餐，夕阳暖，晚风轻，狗儿欢，孩儿笑，絮絮树语，幽幽花香，真是乐趣盎然。但他们不仅享受着植物园，更是深深地爱护着它，只要说两点就足以为证了：植物园花繁叶茂，但从来也见不到一个游人去攀折一枝绿叶，一朵鲜花；１６池郁金香，约有３万朵花，极盛时，观者如潮，流连忘返，摄影机声不绝于耳，但自花开至花落，从无人偷香窃玉。第二点则是游人们对清洁的维护。你在植物园散步，无论是弯弯山道，还是平平花径，也无论是院宇，是亭台，几乎从来也见不到游人扔弃的垃圾，草地上野餐完毕，也决留不下任何残纸旧瓶。星期日晚上，游人散去，你若有兴漫步，所见到的一定是清洁如常的植物园。是啊，面对着心灵美好的游人，植物园才会绽放出最美丽的微笑。
