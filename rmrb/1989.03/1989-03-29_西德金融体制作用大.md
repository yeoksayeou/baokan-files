West Germany is one of the five major economic powers in the West. Since the fourth quarter of 1982, it has experienced six years of prosperity. Over the past six years, its economic growth rate has been slow but stable and healthy, leaving a strong impression of stability on the world public. This is mainly reflected in two aspects: first, the inflation rate has remained at a relatively low level, and second, the international balance of payments is particularly good.

West Germany's ability to achieve stable and healthy economic development is due to multiple factors, with a sound financial system being a crucial internal factor.

The Bundesbank is the central bank of West Germany. Compared to the central banks of other Western countries, it has a relatively high degree of independence. The President of the Bundesbank, the heads of the state central banks, and the members of the Bundesbank's Board of Directors are all appointed by the Federal President. The Central Bank Council independently formulates monetary and financial policies. When the Central Bank Council meets, members of the Federal Government have the right to attend and propose motions, but they do not have voting rights. In reality, the Bundesbank is accountable to the Federal Parliament.

Due to the significant autonomy enjoyed by the Bundesbank, it formulates and implements monetary policies based entirely on its own assessments of the domestic economic and financial situation, with minimal government interference. It has various monetary policy tools at its disposal, including policies to control the money supply, discount policies, open market operations, reserve requirements, and foreign exchange policies. The Bundesbank primarily uses the money supply as a means of controlling monetary supply. The basis for setting the money supply target is the expected rate of growth in productive capacity, changes in the rate of capacity utilization, unavoidable price increases, and expected changes in the velocity of money circulation. The monetary policies adopted by the Bundesbank based on economic and financial conditions have played an important role in stabilizing economic development.

The Federal Republic of Germany is one of the earliest and best countries in the world to implement the universal banking system. Banks in the Federal Republic of Germany provide services to all sectors of society, including industry, commerce, services, companies, individuals, and public sectors, offering deposits, loans, issuance and trading of various securities, and trade settlements. Universal banks not only provide a wide range of investment choices for private clients but also strive to offer various services to institutional investors. Practice has proven that the universal banking system benefits clients, banks, and the economy. This system, which accelerates the turnover of funds and guides the flow of capital, is closely related to the stable development of the West German economy.

Many cities in the Federal Republic of Germany have financial markets. Developed and open financial markets not only attract a large amount of foreign capital but also provide a broad investment arena for the country's surplus capital, meeting the different needs of various sectors of the economy for various types of funds.

　　西德金融体制作用大
    西德是西方五大经济强国之一，自一九八二年第四季度迄今已经历了六年的繁荣时期。六年来，其经济增长速度虽然缓慢，但显得健康稳定，给世界公众留下了稳定发展的印象。主要表现：一是通货膨胀率一直处于较低水平，二是国际收支状况特别好。
    西德经济能够健康稳定地发展，原因是多方面的，而健全的金融体制则是重要的内部因素之一。
    联邦银行是西德的中央银行，和西方其它国家的中央银行相比，具有较大的独立性，联邦银行行长、各州中央银行行长以及联邦银行理事会成员都由联邦总统任命，中央银行理事会独立地制定货币金融政策。中央银行理事会开会时，联邦政府成员有权与会，并有动议权，但没有表决权。实际上联邦银行是对联邦议院负责。
    由于联邦银行享有较大自主权，因此，在制订和实施货币政策方面完全基于自己对国内经济和金融形势的估计，较少受政府干预的影响。它掌握的货币政策手段有多种：控制中央银行货币供应量的政策、贴现政策、公开市场政策、存款准备金政策、外汇政策等。联邦银行主要用中央银行货币量作为控制货币供应的手段。制定中央银行货币量指标的依据是预期的生产能力增长率、设备开工率的变动、不可避免的物价上涨率以及预期的货币流通速度的变化等。联邦银行根据经济和金融形势所采取的货币政策对经济稳定发展起到了重要作用。
    联邦德国是世界上实行全能银行制度最早和最好的国家之一。联邦德国的银行向社会所有行业，包括工业、商业、服务业的公司、个人或公共部门提供存款、贷款，发行和买卖各类证券，办理贸易结算等银行服务。全能银行不仅对私人客户提供全面的投资选择范围，而且也千方百计为机构投资者提供各种服务项目。实践证明，全能银行制度对客户、银行和经济都有好处。这种有利于加速资金周转和引导资金流向的全能银行制度与西德经济稳定发展有密切关系。
    联邦德国的许多城市都设有金融市场。发达开放的金融市场不仅吸引了大量的外资，也为本国的剩余资本提供了广阔的投资园地，满足了经济各界对各类资金不同程度的需要。
