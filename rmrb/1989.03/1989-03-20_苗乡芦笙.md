The Lusheng of the Miao Village

By Guo Jia, Reporter for the People's Daily

    "Without the lusheng, the Miao villages are dull and lifeless, the New Year is cold and bleak."
    "With the lusheng, the Miao people blow it on the slopes during the day, and compete at night in the square."

    The lusheng is popular in the provinces and autonomous regions of Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Hunan. If you have the opportunity to spend the Miao New Year in a Miao area or happen to encounter an annual flower-plucking festival or lusheng festival, you can see various types of lusheng with different shapes and specifications, as well as the vibrant lusheng dance.

    This time, I came to Qiandongnan Prefecture for an interview. Although I did not catch the Miao lusheng festival, what I saw and heard along the way was no less impressive than what you might see or hear at a lusheng festival.

    Among the Miao people, there are many legends about the lusheng, including the saying that "the lusheng is the mother of the Miao people." This shows that the lusheng is the "golden key" to opening the hearts of the Miao people. Whether it is for sending off the deceased, transcending the soul, praying to heaven for peace, or for marriage matches, all must be accompanied by the lusheng and its dance. Some scholars refer to this phenomenon as the "lusheng festival culture" of the Miao people.

    In Miao areas, generally, a larger village will have a lusheng festival, and sometimes a few smaller villages will share one. Areas with the same dress and dialect will have a large lusheng festival. Many major traditional festivals of the Miao people, such as the Fourth of April, the New Harvest Festival, the Miao New Year, the September 27th Gulu Lusheng Festival, the January 18th Zhouxi Lusheng Festival, and the once-every-13-years Guishan Festival, attract tens of thousands of participants. People from dozens or even hundreds of miles away come to join in the festivities, and some festivals last for 7 to 8 days. On the day of the festival, young men bring their lusheng and drums, and young women dress in their finest, with jingling ornaments, blowing and singing as they come from all directions, creating a joyful scene.

    When dancing with the lusheng, everyone must first jump a few symbolic circles in front of the lusheng head (the village elder), and then they can go to a fixed location to blow and dance freely. The lusheng hall is usually set up by the river or in a small square within the village, with the saying "blow the lusheng by the river sandbank, dance with drums on the mountain ridge." According to Miao folklore, "if the lusheng does not sound, the five grains will not grow," so the first song played in the lusheng festival is usually related to agricultural production. It is said that during the Miao New Year lusheng activities, the lusheng teams that go from village to village to play the New Year song can only play "Chasing the Year Song," "Inviting the Dance Song," "Turning Body Song," and "Asking for Flower Belt Song" in the lusheng hall in sequence. The girls' dance movements also change from the beginning of being solemn and elegant to gradually becoming more relaxed, fluid, and passionate.

    Wu Tingjie, deputy director of the Creation Room of the Qiandongnan State Song and Dance Troupe and a member of the Chinese Minority Dance Association, said that the lusheng dance is also known as the "step lusheng dance." It is both a self-entertaining dance of the Miao people and a large-scale folk dance. Some movements in the lusheng dance are quite distinctive, with rich trembling movements, more leg movements, and some that are as vigorous as strong songs and melodies, while others are as gentle as willow branches swaying in the water. The spinning movements are like "pigeons flapping their wings," and the big jumps are like ascending the "mountain of knives" and descending the "sea of fire." Legend has it that the Miao people originally lived in the Yellow River basin and later migrated to the Dongting, Yunnan, and Guizhou areas, where they deeply cherished their hometown. The traditional dance targets of the Miao people, such as "looking up to the sky," are a reenactment of their longing for their homeland and desire to return. Wu Tingjie also told me that the lusheng dance of the Miao people is often performed as the closing act in both domestic and international performances.

    Of course, the lusheng activities of the Miao people are not without restraint. In Danzhai County, in the areas of Nangao and Daxing, the first day of the lunar month of February is the "Drum Turning Festival." After this day, blowing the lusheng is prohibited, and people are fully devoted to production. Even if the lusheng is hung up, the mouth must be plugged with cotton to prevent it from being blown by the wind, otherwise, it is said that it will offend the ancestors and result in a failed harvest. In the Paitiao area, on the last day of the lunar month of February, the "Sealing the Lusheng" ceremony is held. Various lusheng teams blow and dance in the square, and the next day, blowing the lusheng is prohibited until the New Harvest Festival in July, when the rice is full and the seeds are scattered, and the harvest is in sight, before the lusheng can be blown again.

    In the past, only young men could blow the lusheng, and their skill level was often used to measure their abilities. Therefore, there were many lusheng players among the Miao people. Yu Furen, who is now the deputy director of the Art Committee of the Qiandongnan State Song and Dance Troupe, is a member of the Chinese Musicians Association and a famous lusheng performer. He started learning to blow the lusheng from his father at the age of five and could perform in the lusheng hall at the age of eight. In his youth, he became a famous lusheng player in his hometown. Whether it was playing the lusheng in a set, playing the lusheng in pairs, playing the lusheng with the drum, or performing narrative songs, invitation songs, and songs for young men and women to communicate, he could play them all skillfully. For a long time, the lusheng of the Miao people was mainly six-tube and five-tone, and could only play some simple folk tunes. After many years of practice, Yu Furen reformed it into nine-tube, eleven-tube, fifteen-tube, eighteen-tube, and twenty-two-tube lusheng. The reformed lusheng and drums can not only play traditional lusheng tunes but also more complex musical pieces.

    According to Miao customs, women do not blow the lusheng. With the development of society, this custom has been quietly lifted, and girls have joined the stage of blowing the lusheng, blowing and dancing by themselves, showing the gentleness and deep affection of Miao girls.

    Some people say that this is the charm of the lusheng. The lusheng festival brings together those who are just learning to speak, those with snow-white hair, those with budding emotions, and those who never go out. It also inspires those who are usually depressed and idle, making them feel that the lusheng festival is the best place to truly express and vent their emotions.

    Bidding farewell to the Miao village, the enchanting lusheng melody faintly floats in my ears: Lili lili, lili lili...

### 苗乡芦笙

　　苗乡芦笙
    本报记者   郭嘉
    “苗族人没了芦笙，寨寨闷沉沉，过年冷冰冰。”
    “苗族人有了芦笙，白天坡上吹，夜晚坪里赛。”
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——题记
    芦笙盛行于贵州、云南、广西、湖南诸省区，如果有机会在苗族地区过苗年，或巧遇一年一度的跳花场、芦笙节，便可一睹形制、规格不同的各种芦笙和多姿多彩的芦笙舞了。
    我这次来到黔东南州采访，虽未赶上苗家的时节笙会，但一路所见所闻，决不逊于在芦笙场上才会看到或听到的。
    苗族人民中流传着许多关于芦笙的传说，其中就有“芦笙是苗族的母亲”一说，可见，芦笙是“打开苗家心房的金钥匙”。无论是为死人送葬、超渡，还是向天祈求平安、为男女婚配等，都必须伴随芦笙及其舞蹈来进行。有的学者将这一现象称之为苗族的“芦笙场文化。”
    在苗族地区，一般一个较大的村寨都有一个芦笙场，也有几个小村寨共用一个芦笙场的，同一服饰和方言的地区有一个大芦笙场。苗族的很多大的传统节日，像四月八、吃新节、苗年、９月２７谷陇芦笙会、正月１８舟溪芦笙会、１３年一次的牯社节等，参加跳芦笙的人都在万人以上，方圆几十里甚至百里以外的群众都赶来助兴，有的场期持续７、８天之久。节日到来的那一天，小伙子们带着芦笙、芒筒，姑娘们盛装艳服，环佩叮当，从四面八方吹笙踏歌而来，一派欢乐景象。
    跳芦笙时，大伙儿必须先从芦笙头（即寨老）门口象征性地跳几圈，然后方可以到一个固定的地点尽情吹跳。芦笙堂一般设在河边和寨里的小广场上，有“吹笙河沙坝，跳鼓在山梁”之说。苗族民间传说，“芦笙不响，五谷不长”，所以芦笙场里一般吹奏的第一支歌曲都与农业生产有关。据说，在苗年的芦笙活动中，串寨玩年的芦笙队，在芦笙堂里，只能依次吹奏“赶腊调”、“邀踩调”、“转身调”、“讨花带调”，姑娘们的舞蹈动作也由开始的庄重典雅，逐渐转为随和流畅、激烈奔放。
    黔东南州歌舞团教创室副主任，中国少数民族舞蹈协会理事吴廷杰说，芦笙舞又叫“踩芦舞”，它既是苗家一种自娱式的乐舞，又是广场式的民间舞蹈，芦笙舞里的一些动作很有特点，舞姿富有颤性，腿部动作较多，激烈的如同劲歌劲曲，柔情的好似拂水柳丝；旋转的仿佛“鸽子翻翅膀”，大跳的犹如上“刀山”下“火海”。传说苗族原住黄河流域，后迁徙到洞庭、云贵一带，对家乡非常眷恋，苗族的传统舞目中的“仰头朝天”，就是恋土思归的一种再现。吴廷杰还告诉我，苗族的芦笙舞在国际国内演出中常常作为压台节目。
    当然，苗族的芦笙活动也并非毫无节制。在丹寨县南皋、大兴一带，农历２月的第一个亥日为“翻鼓节”，过了这一天就禁止吹芦笙，要人们全心全意搞生产。即使是悬挂起来的芦笙，也要用棉花把嘴塞住，以免被风吹响，据说，否则就会得罪祖宗，使得颗粒无收。在排调区一带，农历２月末日还举行“封芦笙”仪式，各芦笙队在场坝上吹跳一番，第二天，便禁吹芦笙，直到当年７月，谷子饱浆散籽，丰收在望，过吃新节时，才准吹芦笙。
    过去，芦笙只有男青年才能吹，且往往以演奏的水平、技巧的高低，来衡量男青年本事的大与小，所以在苗族中，芦笙手是层出不穷的。如今在黔东南州歌舞团担任艺委副主任的余富文，现已是中国音协会员、著名芦笙演奏家。他从５岁就跟父亲学吹芦笙，８岁就能进芦笙堂吹奏，少年时代便成了家乡有名的芦笙手，无论是套芦笙、对芦笙、芒筒芦笙，或者是叙事曲、邀约曲、男女青年交往曲，他都能够得心应手地吹奏表演。长期以来，苗族的芦笙多为六管五音，只能吹奏一些简单的民间曲调，余富文经过多年实践，先后改革成了九管、十一管、十五管、十八管、二十二管芦笙。改革后的芦笙、芒筒不仅可以演奏传统的芦笙曲，而且还可以演奏比较复杂的乐曲。
    按照苗族的传统习俗，女子是不吹芦笙的，随着社会的发展，这种习俗已悄然解禁，少女们已跻身于吹笙的舞台，自吹自跳，一蹙一笑，表现了苗家少女的温柔和深情。
    有人说，这就是芦笙的魅力，芦笙场把那些呀呀学语的、双鬓作雪的、情窦初开的和大门不出的人统统聚拢起来了，使那些平素郁郁寡欢、游手好闲的人也振作起来了。他们由衷地感慨：芦笙场才是他们感情得以真正宣泄和表达的好场所。
    告别苗乡，耳畔隐隐飘来醉人的芦笙曲：哩勒哩勒、哩勒哩勒……
