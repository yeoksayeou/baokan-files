	Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Li Zhaoxing said today that China has always appreciated and supported the United Nations' efforts to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. He made these remarks at a press conference this afternoon in response to a reporter's question.

	A reporter asked: China has sent a delegation to attend the current session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission being held in Geneva. What is China's attitude towards the United Nations' human rights activities?

	Li Zhaoxing said, China actively participates in the activities of the United Nations in the field of human rights and makes its own efforts in this regard. The Chinese government has, since 1980, signed, ratified, and acceded to seven international conventions related to human rights, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.

	He said: "We believe that the United Nations should prioritize addressing the large-scale and gross violations of human rights caused by colonialism, racism, and foreign aggression and occupation, and should genuinely cooperate internationally to eliminate these behaviors."

	Li Zhaoxing, when talking about China's relations with Indonesia, said that the normalization of relations between the two countries is in line with the interests and wishes of the peoples of both countries and is also conducive to peace and development in the region. He said that China and Indonesia have reached a consensus on three points regarding the normalization of relations between the two countries, including taking further measures to achieve the normalization of relations. The two countries' representatives to the United Nations will continue to consult on this matter.

    外交部发言人说
    我支持联合国人权活动
    新华社北京3月2日电  外交部发言人李肇星今天说，中国一贯赞赏并支持联合国按照联合国宪章的宗旨和原则为促进对人权与基本自由的尊重所作的努力。他是在今天下午举行的新闻发布会上回答记者提问时说这番话的。
    有记者问：中国派代表团出席了目前正在日内瓦举行的联合国人权委员会会议，请问中国对联合国的人权活动持何态度？
    李肇星说，中国积极参加联合国人权领域的活动，并为此作出自己的努力。中国政府自1980年起先后签署、批准并加入了《消除对妇女一切形式歧视公约》等7个与人权有关的国际公约。
    他说：“我们认为，联合国应优先关注由于殖民主义、种族主义和外国侵略、占领所造成的大规模粗暴侵犯人权的行为，并切实为消除这些行为进行国际合作。”
    李肇星在谈到中国同印尼的关系时说，两国关系的正常化符合两国人民的利益和愿望，也有利于这一地区的和平与发展。他说，中国和印尼就两国关系正常化问题达成了三点一致意见，其中包括进一步采取措施，实现两国关系正常化。两国驻联合国代表将进一步就此问题进行磋商。
