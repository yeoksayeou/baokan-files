The Communist Party of Jiangxi Province has decided to focus on three key areas for anti-corruption efforts in the first half of this year, according to Mao Zhiyong, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the closing ceremony of the provincial party building work conference held today.

Mao Zhiyong said the three key areas are:

	—	The supply and distribution of agricultural production materials, including fertilizers, pesticides, plastic films, and diesel, must be strictly in accordance with the quantities and prices set by the provincial government. These must be publicly announced at each level and delivered to individual households to prevent any deductions or personal gain along the way;

	—	Any party or government officials who are building private houses in urban areas must stop immediately. These cases will be reviewed and rectified according to relevant regulations. Additionally, the approval process for new applications to build private houses in urban areas will be halted;

	—	All party and government officials, as well as employees of enterprises and institutions, who have embezzled or withheld public funds must return them within a specified time frame. The goal is to ensure that all such funds are recovered by the end of the first half of the year.

　　江西廉政建设抓三件事
    农业生产资料数量价格张榜公布 
    机关干部在城镇建私房先停后清
    干部职工所侵占的公款限期归还
    新华社南昌３月６日电  （记者梁星）中共江西省委书记毛致用在今天闭幕的全省党的建设工作会议上说，廉政制度建设今年上半年全省将采取措施，突出抓好三件事。
    毛致用说，这三件事是：
    ——农业生产资料包括化肥、农药、薄膜、柴油等供应和分配，一定要按照省政府规定的数量和价格，层层张榜公布，落实到户，坚决杜绝层层克扣、从中谋私的现象；
    ——凡党政机关干部在城镇建私房的，先一律停下来，然后按照有关规定进行清理整顿，同时停止审批申请在城镇建私房的报告；
    ——党政机关、企事业单位的干部职工，凡是拖欠和侵占公款的，必须限期归还，确保在上半年基本清收完毕。
