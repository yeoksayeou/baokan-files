Japanese people have a meaningful activity during the New Year called "try writing." This activity has become widespread among the people, so it has many names, such as "auspicious writing," "initial writing," and "first writing," among others.

"Try writing" involves starting the New Year by writing characters or drawing pictures, with the intention of seeking good fortune. The scale of try writing can vary, from being done at home to being held in public places. Most try writing events are held in venues with large halls, such as community centers, cultural institutions, hotels, gymnasiums, and martial arts halls.

Japanese people judge a person's cultural attainment and refinement by their ability to write Chinese characters. The scrolls for try writing are almost always written with Chinese characters, such as "new land," "eternal spring," "initial heart achieves," and "first sun," among others. The strength and elegance of the brushwork and the grace of the character shapes are enough to make even those of us who use Chinese characters daily marvel in admiration. Many children, under the guidance of volunteer teachers, also enthusiastically participate in this activity. This activity not only brings joy but also, through mutual appreciation and evaluation, cultivates noble sentiments. While fostering friendship, it deepens people's love for culture.

Records show that in ancient Japan, this was an activity only done in the imperial palace during the New Year. Later, it gradually spread to the common people. In the past, try writing works were only kept until the fifteenth day of the first month, when they were burned together. The more vigorous the flames, the better, indicating that the year's writing would be even better. In 1981, a simple and quick method for mounting calligraphy and paintings was invented, and people began to mount their own works instead of burning them, thus changing this old custom. Interestingly, this try writing activity is said to have been transmitted from China to Japan during the Tang Dynasty. The Japanese people have preserved this beneficial tradition for their national culture and widely promoted it among the people as an enlightening activity.

### 日本人新年“试笔”

　　日本人新年“试笔”
    日本人过年，有一项很有意义的活动，叫做“试笔”。现已在群众中普及，所以叫法也多了起来，有人称做“吉写”、“笔始”、“初写”等等。
    “试笔”就是新年伊始，开笔写字画画，其中也有给人讨个吉利的意思。试笔的规模有大有小，可在家中，也可在公共场所。大部分试笔是在会馆、文化机构、旅社、体育馆、武道馆等有大厅的场所举行。
    日本人以能否书写汉字来表明文化程度及修养之高低，试笔的条幅几乎都是写的汉字，如“新的大地”、“千代之春”、“初心遂行”、“初日”等等。笔力之雄健，字形之潇洒，连我们这些天天用汉字书写的人也啧啧称羡。有许多幼儿在“义务老师”们的指点下，也踊跃参加这项活动。这种活动不仅给人以乐趣，而且通过互相观赏品评，陶冶高尚情操。在增进友谊之余，更加深了人们对文化的热爱。
    据记载，在古代的日本，这仅是皇宫中过年时的一项活动，后来逐渐传入民间。过去，试笔的作品只留到正月十五集中火焚，火苗越旺越好，表明来年的字会写得更好。１９８１年，一种简易的快速裱糊字画的方法问世后，人们把自己的字画裱糊起来，不再焚毁，从而改变了这种旧俗。说来有趣，这种试笔活动，据说是唐朝时由中国传到日本的。日本人把这个对民族文化有利的优良传统保留下来，并在民间广泛传播成为一种有教益的活动。
