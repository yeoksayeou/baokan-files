	“Guangdong-Shenzhen Model” Inspirations
	Yang Peixin (Researcher at the Economic, Technological, and Social Development Research Center of the State Council)

	Why did the railway system experience a series of accidents in 1988? Why has the railway system become a bottleneck for national economic development? This is a result of our country's "iron rice bowl" system. From 1950 to 1985, the railway system contributed a total of 115.6 billion yuan in profits and taxes to the state, which is 33 billion yuan more than the total state investment in the railway system during the same period. The basic depreciation rate of the railway system is 4%, which is lower than the national industrial enterprise depreciation rate of 5.1%.

	The 147-kilometer railway from Guangzhou to Shenzhen, connecting the Kowloon Station, was originally a single-track line operated by steam locomotives, with outdated equipment and limited capacity. Overseas Chinese from Hong Kong and Macau could not help but shake their heads in dismay, seeing the poverty and backwardness of the motherland through this window. In March 1983, Guangdong Province, the Hong Kong Branch of Xinhua News Agency, and the Ministry of Railways proposed to the State Council to upgrade the Guangzhou-Shenzhen railway to a double-track line and to establish the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Company, implementing a comprehensive economic responsibility system of input-output and "building the railway with the railway." In 1984, the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Company was established, implementing a new system of "independent operation, self-reliance in profits and losses, self-improvement, and self-development." It not only takes responsibility for operations but also for investments, not only for simple reproduction but also for expanded reproduction. ① It implements a complete independent accounting system, where the company's revenue comes from its own passenger and freight operations, covering costs and calculating profits and losses independently. ② It implements a profit-incremental contract responsibility system, with an initial payment of 20 million yuan to the state, increasing by 2.32% annually, and retaining profits for accumulation. ③ It pays 12.97 million US dollars in foreign exchange annually, with all excess retained. ④ It has independent investment and operational autonomy, including the right to approve project designs, tender construction projects, obtain construction loans, use funds, conduct foreign business negotiations, and introduce equipment and technology. ⑤ It increases fares by 50%.

	The Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Company does not rely on state investment but instead relies on its own accumulation and attracts funds from Hong Kong and Macau. It completed the 5.8 billion yuan double-track project one year ahead of schedule in January 1987, increasing the comprehensive transportation capacity by 70%, basically meeting the demand for passenger and freight transportation. Compared to 1983, the year before the reform, passenger volume increased by 52% annually, by 11% annually, freight volume increased by 75.7% annually, by 15.1% annually, revenue increased by 287% annually, by 40.2% annually, profit increased by 36.3% annually, and foreign exchange earnings increased significantly, by 60% annually. The Guangzhou-Shenzhen Company has repaid overseas loans and creates 50 million US dollars in foreign exchange annually. All passenger express trains are air-conditioned, with attentive and warm service, and have been named "Civilized Trains" by Guangdong Province.

	The "Guangdong-Shenzhen Model" inspires us that as long as we are good at mobilizing domestic and overseas funds, we can not only rapidly develop the railway industry but also quickly repay foreign loans. Using the "Guangdong-Shenzhen Model," we can accelerate the construction of railways not only in coastal areas but also in the energy bases of North China and Northeast China, and even nationwide.

	The essence of the "Guangdong-Shenzhen Model" lies in completely breaking away from the "iron rice bowl" system. To this end, the railway system must "decouple" from the financial system. The financial system should only levy business taxes (which should be reduced to the level of business taxes levied on transportation and telecommunications) and should not provide investments. The railway system should not pay corporate income tax and other taxes. The revenue from railway fare adjustments should all go to the railway system, and the financial system should not take a single cent. In the past, the "iron rice bowl" system has left the railway system emaciated, and now we need to make up for the debt and let the railway system develop independently. Fares can be adjusted first for new lines. Railway passenger and freight fares should be reasonably adjusted, but fare adjustments should not be made in large, concentrated steps to avoid shocking the public and affecting price fluctuations. Instead, they should be adjusted gradually over several years. The adjustment of fares is to maintain the railway's reasonable expenditures and self-development, not for the state to make money, to cover financial expenditures, and not to increase the adjustment range for the sake of increasing financial revenue.

### “广深模式”的启发

　　“广深模式”的启发
    杨培新（国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心研究员）为什么１９８８年铁路接连出事故？为什么铁路已经成为拖国民经济后腿的部门？这是我国大锅饭体制所造成的。１９５０年到１９８５年铁路向国家共上缴利税１１５６亿元，比国家同期对铁路总投资还多３３０亿元。铁路基本折旧率４％，低于全国工业企业５．１％的水平。
    从广州到深圳１４７公里，联接九龙车站，原来铁路是单轨、蒸汽机车牵引，设备落后、运量有限，港澳同胞对之莫不摇头叹息，从这个窗口看到了祖国的贫穷落后。广东省、新华社香港分社和铁道部１９８３年３月向国务院建议将广深铁路改造为复线，并单独成立广深铁路公司，实行投入产出、以路建路的全面经济承包。１９８４年广深铁路公司成立，实行“自主经营，自负盈亏，自我改造，自我发展”的新体制，不仅包运营，而且包投资，不仅包简单再生产，而且包扩大再生产。①实行完全的独立核算，本线客货运营收入为本公司收入，以收抵支，自计盈亏。②实行利润递增包干，以上交２０００万元为基数，年递增２．３２％，留利作为积累。③年上交外汇１２９７万美元，超收全留。④有独立的投资、经营自主权，包括建设项目设计审批权、工程发包权、建设贷款权、资金使用权、对外业务洽谈权和设备、技术引进权。⑤运价提高５０％。
    广深铁路公司不要国家投资，依靠自身积累，引进港澳资金，比原订计划提前一年于１９８７年元月建成了投资５．８亿元的复线，综合运输能力提高７０％，基本上适应了客运货运的需求。１９８７年和改革前的１９８３年相比，旅客发送量增长５２％，年递增１１％，货物发送量增长７５．７％，年递增１５．１％，收入增长２８７％，年递增４０．２％，实现利润年递增３６．３％，创外汇增长幅度很大，年递增６０％。广深公司还清了海外借款，还年创汇５０００万美元。旅客快车全部空调化，服务周到热情，被广东省命名为“文明列车”。
    “广深模式”启发我们，只要善于动员群众资金、海外资金，不但可以迅速发展铁路事业，而且可以很快还清外资。运用“广深模式”不仅可以加速沿海地区，而且可以加速华北东北能源基地乃至全国的铁路建设。
    广深模式的精粹在于和大锅饭体制彻底告别。为此，铁路要和财政“脱钩”，财政除征收营业税（要减到交通、邮电征营业税的水平）外，财政不给投资，铁路也不交所得税等税收。铁路运价调整收入全归铁路，财政不要分文。过去吃大锅饭，把铁路吃得瘦骨嶙嶙，现在要补还欠帐，让铁路独立自主自我发展。运价可以先实行新线新价。铁路客货运价应当合理调整，但是调整运价千万不要采取大幅度、集中调价、一步到位的办法，以免震动人心，影响物价波动。而要几年内有计划地、逐步、碎步调整。运价调整是为了保持铁路的合理开支、自我发展，而不是国家借此赚钱，弥补财政开支，不得为增加财政收入而扩大调价幅度。
