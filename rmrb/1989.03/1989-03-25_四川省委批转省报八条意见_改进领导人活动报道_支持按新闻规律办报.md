The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee recently forwarded the eight opinions from the editorial board of *Sichuan Daily* on improving the reporting of leaders' activities and required all news organizations at all levels in the province to follow these guidelines.

In the past, newspapers, radio, and television stations at various levels in Sichuan frequently reported on leaders' participation in various activities, listing long names that readers were not interested in. To improve news reporting and enhance propaganda effectiveness, the editorial board of *Sichuan Daily* submitted eight opinions to the provincial party committee on improving the reporting of leaders' activities. The main points are as follows:

During the sessions of the provincial party congress, provincial people's congress, and provincial political consultative conference, as well as the representative conferences of various democratic parties and mass organizations, the lists of attendees should be published according to relevant regulations. For major commemorative activities as stipulated by the state (such as National Day), conferences convened by the provincial party committee and provincial government to honor labor models and advanced workers, the lists of attending leaders at the vice-provincial level and above should be published. For work conferences convened by the provincial party committee and provincial government, only the leaders presiding over the meeting and delivering speeches should be reported; other attending leaders should not be mentioned. Generally, work conferences or professional meetings held by provincial departments and mass organizations should not be reported. Whether to report on inspections or investigations conducted by the main leaders of the provincial party committee, provincial people's congress, provincial government, and provincial political consultative conference, and how to report, should be decided by the newspaper according to the news value and journalistic principles. Leaders' participation in commemorative meetings, symposiums, opening ceremonies, school anniversaries, and factory anniversaries organized by various units should not be reported, and the organizing units should not request the newspaper to report on these events merely because leaders are attending. Generally, meetings convened by various associations, academic societies, and councils attended by leaders should not be reported. If leaders raise major new issues in their speeches, these should be reported separately according to their news value. The reporting of leaders' participation in diplomatic activities should be handled according to regulations.
