	In the South, Longing for the North
	Liú Méng

	It was the cold winter in the North, and with a yearning for warmth, I hurried to the South before the Spring Festival, hoping to spend a winter like spring in the land of green grass and fragrant flowers.

	The Chinese Writers' Association's Creation House, where we reside, is located by the Xi Li Lake in Shenzhen, at the foot of the Qilin Mountain. It is a place of exceptionally quiet and beautiful natural surroundings. Old writer Li Na, who had once come here for a vacation, told me excitedly in a phone conversation: "It's so beautiful there, with green bamboo and lush trees everywhere, and the flowers bloom so vividly." Even this old writer, who was born and raised in the eternally spring-like Yunnan, was so captivated, how could I, who grew up in the North, not be enchanted?

	From Beijing to Guangzhou, after more than two hours of flight, I immediately found myself embraced by greenery. Taking a bus from Guangzhou to Shenzhen, the entire journey was filled with the vibrant natural scenery of the South, which shocked us, who had been accustomed to the desolate winter landscape of the North. The stark contrast between the winter scenery of the South and the North in my mind made me naturally think of a ready-made phrase: Oh, this winter spring.

	That night, with the excitement brought by the beautiful and warm winter of the South, I went to bed, expecting to have an even more beautiful and comfortable dream. But who would have thought that I tossed and turned all night and couldn't fall asleep. The creeping cold and the hidden mosquitoes in the room attacked me together under the cover of darkness. To resist these enemies of the South winter, I had to get up and add two more quilts, and also lower the mosquito net. But I couldn't bury my head in the quilt and sleep, the exposed cheeks and ears still felt cold, only the body felt warmer.

	Thus, the impression of the day turned upside down at this moment: the outdoors here is a spring scene, but the indoors is the real winter temperature, which is far from the warmth of the North winter indoors.

	I began to miss the North again. The outdoors in the North winter is cold, especially when the wind blows and the snow falls, the temperature will drop sharply, reaching as low as minus twenty or thirty degrees, and even with fur coats and cotton clothes, the back will still feel the chill. The cold surroundings and the stern faces of the passersby also exude a sense of coldness, unconsciously making you infected with the sense of loss in winter. But as soon as you open the door of your room, a warm current will rush towards you, and your body will immediately feel warm, and your thoughts and emotions will instantly feel the warmth of the family. Perhaps this is also the reason why people in the North hurry home in winter!

	However, my longing is more specific, that is, the stove fire in the North winter, which is another kind of winter scenery with its own charm. I moved into a building with heating facilities only a few years ago, and I spent more time in a flat with a stove for heating. Heating with a stove is a bit dirty, troublesome, and laborious, but it has advantages that heating cannot replace. For example, you can boil water on the stove, and the steam from the kettle will fill the room, making you feel moist and comfortable; again, you can roast sweet potatoes and steamed buns on the stove, and they will come out crispy and fragrant. Surrounding the stove, roasting and eating is so comfortable. These are unique to the North winter life, and I think the South, where the temperature difference is not great throughout the year, will not have them.

	As for the silver world of snowfall in the North, which gives people a sense of fantasy and reverie, it goes without saying that at this moment it is an endless longing that I cannot cut off, and even the annoying windy days that bring trouble to people have now become familiar memories and entered my longing. At this moment, my heart seems to be a little bird, no longer lingering on the green branches of the South, but longing to fly back to the familiar North. Although the winter there is cold and desolate, it is after all the land that nurtured my life, the land of my hometown that I cannot give up.

	Beautiful and warm South, forgive me! No matter who it is, no matter where they go, they will not be indifferent to their homeland. People always belong to their own land.

　　在南方思念着北方
    柳萌
    正是北方寒风凛冽的冬天，怀着对温暖的急切渴望，我于春节前匆匆来到草绿花香的南国，想在这里度过一个春天般的冬天。
    我们居住的中国作家协会创作之家，坐落在深圳市西丽湖畔麒麟山下，是个自然环境十分幽静、美丽的所在。曾经来过这里度假的老作家李纳大姐，在同我一次电话里交谈时，高兴地告诉我：那里真美，到处是青竹绿树，花儿开得也艳。连这位生长在四季如春的云南的老作家都如此倾心，我这在北方长大的人怎能不痴迷呢？
    从北京到广州，经过两个多小时的空中航程，一下飞机便投入绿色的怀抱。改乘汽车由广州到深圳，一路上尽是南方充满生机的自然景色，使我们这些满目存留着北方冬天萧瑟景象的人，立刻为之一震，心中顿时激起难以言喻的欢欣。南方北方冬天迥然不同的自然景观，在我的脑海里形成了十分强烈的对比，很自然地想起了一句现成的话：哦，这冬天里的春天。
    当晚，带着这南方美丽、温暖冬天给予的激动，我睡下了，满以为还会给我一个更为美丽、恬适的梦。谁知这一夜翻来复去怎么也睡不着。悄悄潜来的寒冷和藏匿居室的蚊虫，乘黑夜一起朝我袭来。为了抵御这同属南方冬天的天敌，我不得不起床再加上两床被，还得同时放下蚊帐来。可是我总不能把头埋在被里睡呀，露着的脸颊和耳朵依然感到冷飕飕的，只是身子觉得暖和多了。
    于是白天的那种印象此时翻了个个儿：这里室外是春天的景象，室内则是真正冬天的温度，这一点远不如北方冬天室内紧锁的温暖令人惬意。
    我又思念起北方来了。北方冬天的室外是寒冷的，特别是在起风降雪的时候，温度会骤然下降，最低时零下二三十度，身着皮衣棉衣脊背还会透风。四周清冷的景象和路人古板的脸面也透着寒意，无形中更使你感染着冬天那种失落的氛围。可是只要你推开住室的房门，就会扑来一股暖气，你的身子立刻会觉得暖融融的，思想感情上顿时会意识到家庭的温馨。这大概也正是北方人在冬天匆匆赶路归家的一种心态吧！
    然而，我的思念是更为具体的，那就是北方冬天的炉火，这是另有一番情趣的冬天景象。我住进有暖气装置的楼房是近几年的事，更多的时间是住在用炉火取暖的平房里。用炉火取暖是要脏些、麻烦些、辛苦些，但是它却有着暖气无法代替的好处。比如，可以用炉火烧水，壶中喷出的水气弥漫在室内，使人有着潮糊糊的滋润感觉；再如，可以在炉火上烤白薯烤窝头，烤出来又焦又酥，围在炉火旁边烤边吃好不自在。这些只能属于北方冬天的生活情趣，我想一年四季温差不大的南方就不会有了。
    至于北方落雪天银白的世界给人的遐思和梦幻，不用说在此刻更是我无法剪断的悠悠思念，就连那令人讨厌的刮风天给人带来的烦恼，此刻都变成了亲切的记忆拥进了我的思念中。这时我的心仿佛是只小鸟儿，不再眷恋这南方的绿枝头，多想早日飞回那熟悉的北方。尽管那里的冬天是寒冷的空寂的，但它毕竟养育了我的生命，是我无法割舍的故乡土地。
    美丽温暖的南方，原谅我吧！无论是谁，无论走到哪里，都不会冷淡他的故土。人都是永远属于他自己那块土地的。
