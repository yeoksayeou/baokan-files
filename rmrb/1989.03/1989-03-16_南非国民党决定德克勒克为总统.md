The National Party of South Africa has decided on De Klerk as President.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Gaborone on March 14, the decision-making committee of the ruling National Party of South Africa informed President Botha last night that the committee had decided that the new leader of the National Party, De Klerk, would be the state president.

This decision was unanimously made by the 30-member Federal Council after an emergency meeting that lasted two and a half hours late last night.

In a statement issued after the meeting, the Federal Council said it firmly opposed Botha's proposal to separate the positions of state president and party leader. This statement also received unanimous support from the decision-making committee of the National Party in parliament.

　　南非国民党决定德克勒克为总统
    据新华社哈博罗内３月１４日电  据非洲新闻组织今天报道，南非执政党国民党的决策委员会昨晚向南非总统博塔发出通报说，该委员会已决定由国民党新领导人德克勒克为国家总统。
    这项决定是３０人组成的联邦理事会昨天深夜经过两个半小时的紧急会议一致作出的。
    联邦理事会在会后发表的一份声明说，该理事会坚决反对博塔提出的国家总统和党的领导人两个职务分开的行动。这项声明也得到了国民党在议会的决策委员会的一致赞同。
