	Returning from Zhuolu and Talking about Agriculture

	People's Daily reporter Yang Zhenwu

	Several years of stagnation in agriculture have suddenly made the situation severe. Some people, while being alert, tend to make some impractical judgments, as if the problems are extremely serious. Recently, the reporter visited rural areas in Zhuolu County, Hebei Province, and found a different perspective.

		Complaints, but Still Cultivating the Land

	Farmers' complaints are numerous these days, and Zhuolu is no exception. Due to the price increases in agricultural production materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic film, and the relatively low state procurement prices for grain, farmers have little profit from growing grain. According to county officials, farmers cultivating an acre of grain field, after a year of hard work, might only earn a few dozen yuan, far less than the income of a small vendor in a few days.

	However, complaints are complaints; when it comes to farming, most farmers are still diligent. Along the banks of the Sanggan River, we observed that the winter wheat management is meticulous, and the fields prepared for spring planting are already piled with manure. Over the past 10 years, the county's total grain production has remained stable at around 150 million kilograms. Even last year, despite the agricultural disaster, the grain production here did not decrease, reaching 165 million kilograms, and the state procurement task was also completed satisfactorily.

	When discussing the county's stable grain production, the deputy county magistrate in charge of agriculture, Zhang Jinghe, spoke with some pride. He said, "Chinese farmers are very lovable. Because they have experienced hunger in the past, they deeply understand the truth of 'no grain, no stability.' Combined with the sense of social responsibility to 'pay tribute to the state' and the inertia of traditional agrarian ideology, it forms the farmers' deep affection for the land."

	The reporter once chatted with a farmer who went to the city to clean toilets. He had a lot to say, mentioning that in the past few years, the government had forgotten about the farmers and did not know how difficult it is to farm. Many people really did not want to farm anymore. But upon reflection, it's not possible! If farmers do not farm, where will the grain come from, and what will everyone eat? Finally, he said seriously, "Actually, farming is not easy now, but everyone, from top to bottom, is speaking for the farmers. Can we still complain endlessly?"

		We Cannot Go Back to "Grain First"

	"Zhuolu County's stable grain production in recent years is largely due to the prosperity of other industries," said County Magistrate Xian Xubang. He believes that focusing on grain production should not return to the "grain first" policy!

	Zhuolu County has suffered enough from the "grain first" policy in the past. In recent years, by adjusting the industrial structure and focusing on comprehensive management of mountainous areas, the county has established the operational policy of "strengthening one foundation (grain), developing three pillars (forestry, animal husbandry, and township enterprises)." This has brought about a good situation where the foundation is stable and promotes all industries, and all industries are prosperous and stabilize the foundation. Farmers have obtained many benefits from operating fruit trees, vegetables, and running enterprises, which they have supplemented to grain production. It is reported that in recent years, the county's investment in agriculture has reached more than 80 million yuan, most of which is self-raised by farmers. It can be imagined that without the development of other industries in rural areas, this money would not have been available.

	The village of Shuangshu, located by the Sanggan River, has relatively good natural conditions suitable for grain production. However, in the past, it focused on a single industry and never shook off the "poverty" label. During the second phase of rural reform, they focused on agriculture, developed forestry and animal husbandry, and ran enterprises, paving a new path of developing five industries: agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and enterprises. Last year, the village's per capita grain production was 700 kilograms, and the per capita income reached 670 yuan. Therefore, some rural cadres deeply felt, "Grain production must be grasped, but focusing only on grain production is not enough!"

		Seeking Higher Yields through Science and Technology

	Zhuolu is a mountainous county with "seven mountains, one water, and two parts farmland," with a cultivated land area of about 600,000 mu. In the past few years, through planned adjustments to planting structures and other land uses, the grain field area has decreased by 110,000 mu. This is undoubtedly an unfavorable factor for grain production to reach a new level. Some county and township officials believe that in the future, the potential for grain increase mainly lies in increasing yields per unit area, and these all depend on science and technology for support.

	In the past, there was a saying, "Believe that farmers know how to farm," which played an important role in emphasizing respect for farmers' autonomy and stopping village cadres' arbitrary commands. However, from a developmental perspective, it is not comprehensive. In fact, most farmers with generally low educational levels are not very knowledgeable about scientific farming. The reason why some land has low output rates is here. Baodai Township, which focuses on grain production, specially established a farmer technical school, which is well received by farmers. This township promoted the standardized cultivation technology of corn, and last year, the 11 "hundred-mu squares" had an average yield of 925 kilograms per mu. County officials said that as long as one thinks creatively, there are many things that can be done in the aspect of seeking grain through science and technology.

### 涿鹿归来话农桑

　　涿鹿归来话农桑
    本报记者  杨振武
    几年的农业徘徊，突然间形势变得严峻起来。一些人在警觉之余，又难免得出一些不切实际的判断，似乎问题严重得不得了。不久前，记者到河北涿鹿县农村转了一圈，所见所闻，却是别有一番感受。
    　　　　怨言归怨言　不忘种好田
    如今农民抱怨多，涿鹿也不例外。由于化肥、农药、薄膜等农业生产资料的价格上涨，粮食定购价格相对偏低，农民种粮已很少有利。据县里同志测算，农民种一亩粮田，辛苦一年，闹好了只有几十元的赚头，远不如一个小贩几天的收入。
    不过，怨言归怨言，论起种田来，多数农民还是毫不含糊的。我们沿桑干河畔观察，只见越冬的小麦管理精细，准备春播的地里已备起堆堆粪肥。近１０年该县粮食总产一直稳定在１．５亿公斤左右，就连去年农业受灾，这里的粮食也没掉下来，总产达到１．６５亿公斤，定购任务完成得也不差。
    谈起全县粮食的稳定增产，主管农业的副县长张景河颇带几分自豪，他说，中国农民是十分可爱的，由于他们过去挨过饿，深知“无粮不稳”的真谛，再有“纳公粮”的社会责任感，加上传统农本思想的惯性作用，构成了农民对土地的深深依恋。
    记者曾同一位进城掏粪的农民攀谈。他一肚子话往外掏，说是前些年政府忘了农民，不知道种地有多难，很多人真不想再种了。但细一琢磨，不行！要是农民都不种地，粮食从哪里来，大家吃什么呢？末了，他一本正经地说：“其实，现在种田也不易，但上上下下都在为农民说话，咱还能发起牢骚来没完！”
    　　　　不能再搞“以粮为纲”
    “涿鹿县这几年的粮食稳定增产，很大程度是沾了其他各业兴旺的光。”县长项续邦认为，抓粮食生产，切不可再搞“以粮为纲”！
    涿鹿县过去吃够了“以粮为纲”的苦头，这几年调整产业结构，狠抓了山区综合治理，确立了“强化一个基础（粮食）、发展三个支柱（林业、畜牧业、乡镇企业）”的经营方针，才换来“基础稳促百业，百业兴稳基础”的好形势。农民把从经营林果、蔬菜和办企业中得到的很多好处，贴补到了粮食生产上。据介绍，这几年全县用于农业方面的投资达８０００多万元，大部分都是农民自筹的。可以想见，如果没有农村其他各业的发展，这些钱是拿不出来的。
    地处桑干河畔的双树村，自然条件较好，适宜发展粮食生产，但前些年搞“单打一”，一直没有摆脱“穷”字。在农村第二步改革中，他们围绕农业抓林果，上牧业，办企业，走出了农林牧副企五业并举的新路子。去年全村人均产粮７００公斤，人均收入达到６７０元。所以一些农村干部深有感触地说：“粮食不抓不行，光抓粮食也不行！”
    　　　　向科技要产出
    涿鹿是个“七山一水二分田”的山区县，耕地面积约６０万亩。前几年通过有计划地调整种植结构和其他用地，粮田面积减少了１１万亩。这无疑是今后粮食上新台阶的不利因素。一些县乡干部认为，往后粮食增产的潜力主要在提高单产上，而这些都要靠科技保驾。
    前些年有个“要相信农民会种地”的说法，对强调尊重农民的自主权，制止村干部们的瞎指挥起过重要作用，但用发展的眼光看，它不够全面。实际上，文化程度普遍不高的农民多数对科学种田不算内行，一些土地之所以产出率不高，原因就在这里。重点产粮的保岱乡为此专门开办了农民技术学校，深受农民的欢迎。这个乡推广玉米模式化栽培技术，去年种的１１个“百亩方”，平均亩产达到９２５公斤。县里的同志说，只要动脑筋，在向科技要粮问题上，可作的文章也是很多的。
