Random Thoughts

I
Shu Wu's article "Listen to Their Words and Observe Their Actions," published on February 27 in the *People's Daily* supplement *Great Earth*, is very reasonable—it's a good article. We have seen too many instances where people say one thing but do another. The article says, "Observe their actions and then listen to their words; this advice is very relevant today." Here, I would like to add a sentence: Nowadays, there are many publications, and it's impossible to read everything. To save time and preserve one's eyesight, sometimes it's also a good idea: "Observe their actions and don't necessarily listen to their words." Although we have the good tradition of "not rejecting words because of the person," no matter how good the words sound, if the speaker doesn't even believe themself, then the words are just used to deceive people, cover up shame, and hide ugliness... It's just makeup and lies, so it's fine not to listen or look. After all, time is precious.

In Lu Xun's "Kong Yiji," there is a restaurant called Xianheng Wine Shop. Nowadays, such places are everywhere, not just in Shaoxing, but at least in Shanghai and Beijing. There are grand Xianheng Wine Shops that not only sell salted bamboo shoots and spiced beans but can also host luxurious banquets. Times have changed, and people's lives have indeed improved greatly. Kong Yiji is dead. If he were still alive, dragging his two legs broken by others, he crawled to the Xianheng Wine Shop to try to drink a cup of wine on credit and get some spiced beans, and then hang a new account on the chalkboard, the Xianheng boss would, as usual, take down the chalkboard hanging on the wall: "Kong Yiji, you still owe nineteen yuan!" Old Kong, after all, was an educated man and understood some new ideas, so he pleaded, "That's an old account, no need to calculate it precisely. We should look to the future. Now there are many millionaires. Those who get rich first will help those who get rich later. Who knows if one day Kong Yiji might... Just hang a new account today!" The boss shook his head: "Old accounts unsettled, keep your mouth shut!" Kong Yiji couldn't drink the wine and had to crawl out of the Xianheng's grand door.

　　杂感
    一
    舒芜同志在二月二十七日《人民日报·大地》发表了一篇《听其言而观其行》，挺有道理——是篇好文章。我们对于说得好听，做得不怎么的事，见得太多了。文章说“观其行再听其言，这话在今天也很有现实性。”我在这儿倒还想补充一句，现在出版物很多，不可能什么都看，为了节省时间，爱惜目力，有时也不妨：“观其行而不必听其言”。虽然我们也有“不以人废言”的好传统，话说得不管多好听，反正连说的人自己也并不相信自己的话，说出来不过用来骗骗人，遮遮羞，掩掩丑，……涂脂抹粉的谎话，其实不听不看也是可以的，时间到底是宝贵的嘛。

    鲁迅先生《孔乙己》中有家咸亨酒店，现在到处都有了，不但绍兴，至少上海、北京，开起阔气的咸亨酒店，不单卖盐煮笋和茴香豆，还可以开富丽堂皇的高级宴会，时代不同，人民生活的确大大提高了。孔乙己已经死了，假使他还活着，拖着两条被人打断的腿，爬到咸亨酒店再想赊口酒喝喝，搞点茴香豆，再在粉板上挂笔新帐，咸亨老板照例把那块挂在墙头的粉板摘下来：“孔乙己，你还欠十九个钱呢？”老孔毕竟是念过书的人，也懂点新道理，便求情了：“那是旧帐，不必细算嘛，眼睛要向前看，现在多的是万元户，先富起来，先富必有后富，说不定我孔乙己有朝一日……今天就挂个新帐吧！”老板摇摇头：“旧帐未清，免开尊口！”孔乙己喝不成酒，只好爬出了咸亨的大门。
