The Population "Military Order"
— A Record of the Signing of the Hebei Population Target Management Responsibility Book

On the afternoon of March 10, the Hebei Provincial Government and various prefectures and cities signed the population target management responsibility book at the provincial family planning work conference. The mayors and prefectural heads of 18 prefectures and cities successively walked onto the stage and signed their names on the red responsibility book. Provincial Governor Yue Qifeng and Deputy Governor Wang Zuwu each wrote their names on every responsibility book. Two copies were made, one to be kept and the other for reference.

Population! Population! Hebei is currently at the peak of its birth rate, with a birth rate as high as 20.35‰ last year, placing enormous pressure on economic and social development. To quickly reduce the birth rate, the provincial government decided to implement population target responsibility management: all target figures for the birth rate, planned birth rate, and multiple birth rate for each prefecture and city in 1989 and 1990 were written in the responsibility book. This is clearly a "military order"!

Provincial Party Secretary Qing Chongzhi said: Issuing a "military order" means the population situation is severe, and it also means that the responsibilities at all levels are heavy. He read out the list of counties with the largest population growth rates in the province and emphasized: The Communist Party values credibility and seriousness. Signing and sealing the document means it must be fulfilled. Failing to meet the "military order" means that if the population growth in any area continues to exceed the control standard, the person who issued the order will be held responsible, even to the point of being removed from office.

Provincial Party Secretary Li Wenxiang did some calculations: Last year, the province had nearly 1.2 million newborns, an average of 3,200 per day. During the three days of this family planning conference, 10,000 babies were born.

With the responsibility book in hand, the weight on their shoulders is immense. Many signers expressed their feelings. Yu Tongyi, deputy head of the Hengshui Regional Administration, said: Names are written every day, but today it feels different. The pen feels heavy and the hand trembles. Because the responsibility book brings a sense of mission and urgency.

After the meeting, people continued to discuss the topic of the "military order." There was reflection, pressure, and grumbling, but more importantly, there was confidence.

### 人口“军令状”——河北人口目标管理责任书签字侧记

　　人口“军令状”
    ——河北人口目标管理责任书签字侧记
    本报记者  陈国琦
    ３月１０日下午，河北省政府和各地、市人口目标管理责任书在省计划生育工作会场上签订。１８个地市的专员、市长依次走上主席台，一一在红色责任书上签字。省长岳岐峰、副省长王祖武也分别在每张责任书上写上姓名。一式两份，留存备查。
    人口！人口！河北目前正值生育高峰，去年人口出生率高达２０．３５‰，给经济和社会发展带来巨大压力。为了尽快把人口出生率降下来，省政府决定实行人口目标责任管理：把各地、市１９８９和１９９０年的人口出生率、计划生育率和多胎率应达到的目标数字全部写在责任书上，这分明是一纸“军令状”！
    省委书记邢崇智说：立“军令状”，一是说明人口形势严峻，二是表明各级责任重大。他当场念了全省人口增长幅度较大县的名单，强调：共产党最讲信用，讲认真。签字画押，就要兑现。误了“军令状”，哪里人口增长继续超过控制界标，要追究立状者的责任，直至撤职。
    省委副书记李文姗算了一笔账：去年全省新生婴儿近１２０万，平均每天３２００人。在我们开这个计划生育会议的三天中，就有万名娃娃呱呱坠地。
    手捧责任书，肩上重千斤。不少签字者发出了感慨。衡水地区行署副专员于同义说：名字天天写，今天写来不一般，觉得笔重手颤。因为责任书系上了使命感和紧迫感。
    会散了，人们仍继续谈论着“军令状”的话题。有反思，有压力，有牢骚，但更多的是信心。
