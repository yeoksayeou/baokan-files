Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 14th.

Li Peng, the Premier, presided over the 38th regular meeting of the State Council on March 10th and 14th, discussing and adopting the "Decision of the State Council on Key Points of Current Industrial Policy."

The "Decision" points out that formulating a correct industrial policy, clarifying the focus areas for support and restraint in various sectors of the national economy, is an important basis for adjusting the industrial structure and implementing macro-control. The formulation and implementation of industrial policies are conducive to organically combining reform with development, planning with the market, and are beneficial to better implementing the overall policy of reform and opening up. It is also conducive to the smooth completion of the current tasks of rectifying the economic environment and economic order.

The "Decision" points out that at present, under the condition of total demand exceeding total supply in China's economy, there are also relatively serious problems in the industrial structure. It is necessary to start from the current actual situation, rationally formulate industrial policies, while controlling and reducing total social demand, and focus on adjusting and transforming the industrial structure to prevent economic stagflation. On the basis of optimizing the structure, improve the quality and efficiency of the national economy, and ensure and promote the long-term stable development of China's economy.

The "Decision" proposes that the basic direction and tasks of adjusting the industrial structure at present are to concentrate efforts on developing agriculture, energy, transportation, and raw materials and other basic industries, strengthen industries and products that can increase effective supply, enhance the momentum of economic development, and at the same time control the development of processing industries to make them coordinate with the development of basic industries.

The "Decision" arranges the sequence of industrial development according to factors such as market demand, industrial linkage, technological progress, foreign exchange earnings, and economic benefits, and clearly stipulates what to support and encourage, and what to restrict and prohibit.

The "Decision" puts forward policy guarantees and organizational implementation requirements from aspects such as funds, taxation, prices, foreign exchange, foreign trade, materials, and enterprise organization.

The "Decision" clearly stipulates that the power to formulate industrial policies lies with the State Council. Local authorities must implement the state's industrial policies and cannot harm the overall and long-term interests of the state for the sake of local and short-term interests.

This "Decision" was modified based on the opinions discussed at the 33rd regular meeting of the State Council and submitted to this regular meeting for discussion and adoption. The "Decision" will be officially announced on March 18th.

Eleven people attended this regular meeting of the State Council, and three were absent.
