Recently, the phenomenon of relatives of military personnel coming to the military base to do business has become quite prominent. According to statistics from a certain regiment last year, 150 or more relatives of military personnel came to this regiment to do business. These individuals are mostly wives, children, or friends of officers, as well as some relatives of soldiers. They stay in the unit for as little as ten days or half a month, and as long as three to five months, affecting the development of various tasks within the unit.

Relatives of military personnel who come to the unit to do business usually work, handle affairs, and run their businesses in the vicinity of the camp. They eat and stay in the company, and even if they "set up their own kitchen," their living and movement still affect others. These relatives often freely enter and exit the barracks, and some even conduct business within the camp, moving from one company to another, shouting loudly to sell their goods, causing the camp's order to be in chaos.

During the process of doing business, some relatives of military personnel, through connections and relationships, bring scarce resources and high-end goods into the unit, turning the barracks into their temporary warehouse. Some even engage in buying and selling, tax evasion, and damage the unit's reputation.

Some military family members, especially family members of officers, come to the unit to do business, causing some officers to not only worry about their living arrangements but also have to go out to find sources for them, discuss "business," and their main duties are inevitably affected. A certain regiment's platoon leader was originally active in his work, with a strong sense of duty. His platoon was often rated as an advanced unit. After his wife came to the military base and opened a small shop near the camp, this platoon leader often helped his wife manage the counter and directed soldiers to establish relationships and use backdoors to wholesale and sell goods, resulting in disciplinary action from the unit.

I believe that our military personnel's relatives should support the work of officers and soldiers, not drag them down, and definitely not come to the military base to do business, allowing them to have more energy to complete the glorious mission of safeguarding and building the motherland entrusted to them by the Party and the people.

### 劝说军人亲友莫来部队经商

　　劝说军人亲友莫来部队经商
    最近，军人亲友来部队经商的现象比较突出。据某团去年统计，来这个团经商的军人亲友达１５０多人次。这些人大多是干部的妻子儿女或亲朋好友，还有部分战士的亲属。他们来队少则十天半月，多则三五个月，影响了部队各项工作的开展。
    军人亲友来队经商，平时在营区附近干活、办事、跑生意，吃住则在连队，即便是“另起炉灶”，住宿、出入也免不了影响他人。这些军人亲友经常自由出入营房，有的人甚至在营区内做起买卖，跑这个连，转那个连，高声叫卖，营区秩序非常混乱。
    这经商过程中，个别军人的亲友通过托人情、拉关系，将一些紧俏物资、高档商品运进部队，营房成了他们的临时库房。有的人甚至倒买倒卖、偷税漏税，损害了部队的声誉。
    一些军人家属，特别是干部家属来队经商，使得一些干部既要在生活上为他们操心劳神，又要外出为他们寻找货源，谈“生意”，本职工作势必受到影响。某部一位连长原来工作积极，事业心强，他所在连队常被评为先进单位。自从他妻子来部队在营区附近开了一家小商店后，这位连长常替妻子守柜台，并指使战士拉关系、走后门批发倒卖商品，受到部队处分。
    我认为，我们的军人亲友要支持干部、战士的工作，不要拖他们的“后腿”，更不要来部队经商，让他们有更多的精力来完成党和人民交给的保卫祖国、建设祖国的光荣使命。　　　　　　　　　　　兰州军区司令部办公室　向光明
