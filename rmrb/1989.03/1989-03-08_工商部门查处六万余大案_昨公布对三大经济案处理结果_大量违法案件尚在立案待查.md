Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th.

The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has investigated over 60,000 major cases last year, with state-owned and collective enterprises, as well as government agencies, military units, accounting for 51.3% of the cases. In some provinces and cities, this proportion reaches 80% to 90%.

Gan Guoping, Vice Minister of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, pointed out that the task of investigating speculative illegal activities remains arduous. Many illegal behaviors uncovered during the company rectification still need further investigation. Many provinces have a large number of cases pending investigation, and there are obstacles in investigating some major cases. He said that to implement the central government's policies, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce will take decisive measures, strengthen efforts, eliminate interference, and continue to investigate economic illegal cases thoroughly.

Today, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce held a press conference and announced the handling decisions for three major economic cases: the case of Jinglong (Changzhou) Material Supply Station illegally profiting from steel sales, the case of Zhejiang Zhe'nan Development Department and Zhehua Company illegally selling 123.8 tons of electrolytic nickel, and the case of Hunan Provincial Medicinal Materials Company and its affiliated labor service company selling large quantities of expired white peony.

From January to September last year, Jinglong (Changzhou) Material Supply Station violated relevant regulations and sold 5,200 tons of thin steel plates, which were allocated by the China Construction Materials Allocation and Contracting Joint Company, at market prices instead of planned prices, earning illegal profits of over 10 million yuan. The State Administration for Industry and Commerce decided to confiscate all illegal earnings and requested relevant departments to pursue disciplinary or legal responsibilities for the responsible individuals.

From September 1986 to June 1988, Hunan Provincial Medicinal Materials Company sold 1.73 million kilograms of white peony, which had been approved for scrapping by the State Pharmaceutical Administration in 1983, to pharmaceutical businesses and drug peddlers in Hunan, Henan, Guangdong, and other provinces, earning illegal income of 1.99 million yuan. Meanwhile, the company's affiliated labor service company sold 790,000 kilograms of expired white peony to pharmaceutical businesses and drug peddlers in Guangdong, Guangxi, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, and other provinces, earning illegal income of 1.12 million yuan. The State Administration for Industry and Commerce decided to impose heavy penalties: confiscating all illegal earnings totaling 3.125 million yuan from Hunan Provincial Medicinal Materials Company and its affiliated labor service company, imposing fines of 199,700 yuan and 112,700 yuan respectively, and transferring the case to judicial and disciplinary authorities.

Zhejiang Zhe'nan Light Industry Raw Materials Development Department and Zhehua United Development Company are two companies with the same organizational structure but different names. In March last year, the State Planning Commission allocated 230 tons of electrolytic nickel to Zhejiang Province to meet the urgent needs of local production enterprises. However, Zhe'nan Development Department, in collaboration with the State Materials Reserve Bureau, adopted practices such as not moving the goods, issuing invoices to each other, layering prices, and reselling in circles to jointly profit. By the time the nickel reached the users, the price per ton had risen from 57,700 yuan to 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, with the highest reaching 104,000 yuan. The Zhejiang Provincial Administration for Industry and Commerce decided to impose a fine of 3 million yuan on Zhe'nan Development Department and Zhehua Company respectively.

　　工商部门查处六万余大案
    昨公布对三大经济案处理结果 
    大量违法案件尚在立案待查
    本报北京３月７日讯  记者潘岗报道：国家工商局副局长甘国屏今天说，去年全国工商行政管理机关查处的６万余件大案中，国营、集体企业及机关团体、部队占的比重大，占５１．３％，最高的省、市达到８０％—９０％。
    甘国屏指出，目前查处投机违法活动任务仍然相当艰巨，清理公司中揭发出的许多投机违法行为需要进一步查处，各省有很大数量的违法案件尚在“立案待查”，而查处某些大案仍有阻力。他说，为了认真贯彻中央的方针，国家工商局将陆续采取一些坚决措施，加强力量，排除干扰，把查处经济违法案件的工作进行下去，一抓到底。
    本报北京３月７日讯　记者潘岗报道：国家工商局今天召开新闻发布会，公开宣布对京龙（常州）物资供应站倒卖钢材牟取暴利案、浙江浙能开发部和浙华公司非法倒卖１２３．８吨电解镍案、湖南省药材公司及其所属劳动服务公司大量销售报废白芍案的处理决定。
    京龙（常州）物资供应站于去年１月到９月间，违反有关规定，将中国基建物资配套承包联合公司调拨给的计划内平价薄钢板５２００多吨转为议价销售，获取非法所得１０００余万元。国家工商局决定将其全部非法所得予以没收，对有关责任人员，提请有关部门追究其政纪或法律责任。
    １９８６年９月至１９８８年６月间，湖南省药材公司先后将国家医药局早在１９８３年批准报废的１７３万余公斤白芍销售给湖南、河南、广东等地的医药经营单位和药贩，获取非法收入１９９万多元。同时，该公司所属的劳动服务公司将从省药材公司购入的变质报废白芍７９万多公斤倒卖给广东、广西、河南、安徽、湖南等地的医药经营单位和药贩，获取非法收入１１２万余元。国家工商局决定从重处理：全部没收湖南省药材公司以及所属劳动服务公司非法收入共３１２．５万元，分别处罚款１９．９７万元和１１．２７万元，并将此案开列清单移交司法机关和纪律、监察机关。
    浙江省浙能轻工原材料经营开发部和浙华联合开发公司是两块牌子、同一组织机构的企业。去年３月，国家计委专项批供给浙江省２３０吨电解镍，以满足省内生产企业急需。但是，浙能开发部与国家物资储备局签订合同，货源落实后，即采取货不动窝、互开发票、层层加价、转圈倒卖的做法共同牟利。待这些镍到用户手中时，吨价已由５．７７万元涨到六七万元，最高上涨到１０．４万元。浙江省工商局决定对浙能开发部和浙华公司各处罚款３０万元。
