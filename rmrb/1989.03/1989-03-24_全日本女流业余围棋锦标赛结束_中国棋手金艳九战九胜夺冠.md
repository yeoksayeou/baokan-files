The 31st All-Japan Women's Amateur Go Championship concluded today. Chinese amateur player Jin Yan from Shanghai secured the championship title. This is the first time a Chinese player has topped this type of competition.

128 female players from all over Japan began competing on March 18th. Jin Yan achieved a perfect record of nine wins in nine matches, earning her the championship. She was awarded the "Nihon Ki-in Cup" and the "Mainichi Cup" by the Nihon Ki-in, and was also granted the title of "Women's Amateur Go Championship Winner." This victory qualifies her for direct participation in the "Mainichi Amateur Hon'inbo Tournament" hosted by the Mainichi Shimbun and the "Asahi Amateur Top 10 Tournament" hosted by the Asahi Shimbun. It is planned that renowned player Takeyama Michiharu will play a commemorative match with Jin Yan on NHK television in April, with Takeyama giving four stones.
