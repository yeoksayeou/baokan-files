Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 18th - (Reporter Chen Maodi) The two criminals, Zhu Wenbo, who intentionally killed Japanese tourist Kobayashi Yasuji, and Wu Guilong, who robbed Japanese tourist Kida Tayoko of his belongings, were sentenced to death by the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court this afternoon, with their political rights revoked for life.

The court found that Zhu Wenbo had previously been sentenced to three years in prison for hooliganism. On the night of July 29 last year, he entered the Jinjiang Hotel where Kobayashi Yasuji was staying. Due to a dispute, he pushed Kobayashi Yasuji onto the bed and struck his neck with both hands, causing Kobayashi Yasuji to die from mechanical asphyxia. After the murder, Zhu Wenbo staged the crime scene and stole some of Kobayashi Yasuji's belongings before fleeing.

The 23-year-old Wu Guilong, on the night of October 31, 1988, sneaked into the North Tower of the Jinjiang Hotel in Shanghai. Pretending to ask Japanese tourist Kida Tayoko for help in translating a Japanese newspaper, he struck Kida Tayoko's head with a hammer when he was off guard. He then held a knife to Kida Tayoko, forcing him into a closet, causing Kida Tayoko to suffer a head wound and injuries to his right hand and left fingers. Afterward, Wu Guilong robbed Kida Tayoko of his belongings worth over 5,500 yuan and fled. Additionally, from 1986 to August 1988, Wu Guilong repeatedly sneaked into several international hotels in Shanghai, stealing over 2,000 yuan worth of belongings from foreign tourists.

　　两涉外杀人抢劫犯被判死刑
    新华社上海３月１８日电  （记者陈毛弟）故意杀害日本旅游者小林康二的朱文博和抢劫日本旅客木代泰雄财物的吴桂龙，今天下午被上海市中级人民法院依法判处死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。
    法院经审理查明，朱文博曾因犯流氓罪被判刑三年。他于去年７月２９日晚，进入小林康二住宿的锦江饭店，因故与小林康二发生争执，将小林康二推倒在床上，用双手猛击其颈部，致使小林康二因机械性窒息而死亡。朱文博杀人后伪造现场，并窃取了小林康二随身携带的部分财物后潜逃。
    ２３岁的吴桂龙于１９８８年１０月３１日晚潜入上海锦江饭店北楼，以请日本旅客木代泰雄帮助翻译日文报纸为幌子，乘其不备之机，用榔头猛击木代泰雄头部，并持刀将他逼入壁橱，致使木代泰雄头顶裂伤，右手虎口及左手手指被划伤。之后，吴桂龙劫得木代泰雄价值５５００余元的财物潜逃。此外，吴桂龙还从１９８６—１９８８年８月，多次潜入上海一些涉外宾馆，窃得外国旅客的财物２０００余元。
