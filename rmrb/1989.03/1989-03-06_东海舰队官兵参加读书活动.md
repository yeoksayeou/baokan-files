The "Spirit of the East Sea" reading activity is currently being carried out in 164 grassroots ships and companies of the East Sea Fleet of the Navy. Over the past two months, more than 16,000 officers and soldiers have enthusiastically participated in their spare time, seeking knowledge from 100 selected books. It is understood that such a large-scale joint military-civilian reading activity is the first of its kind in the Navy.

These 100 books cover four categories: military theory, military cultivation, military literature, and the cultivation of dual-purpose talents.

The activity will conclude in April, at which time a unified examination will be conducted, and representative teams will be selected from the grassroots participating ships and companies to gather in Zhoushan. They will compete in military intelligence contests, book review and essay presentations, and finally, the outstanding team and individual awards for this activity will be selected.

　　东海舰队官兵参加读书活动
    “东海魂”读书活动正在海军东海舰队１６４个基层舰连开展。两个月来，已有１６０００多名干部战士利用业余时间踊跃参加，从精选的１００本读物著作中寻求知识。据了解，这样大规模军民联合举办的读书活动，在海军还是首次。
    这１００本读物，包括军事理论、军人修养、军事文学、两用人才培养等４大类。
    活动将在４月份结束，到时将统一出卷征答，并从基层参赛舰连中挑选代表队汇聚舟山，进行军事智力竞赛、书评论文演讲比赛，最后评选出此次活动的优秀班组奖和优秀个人奖。
