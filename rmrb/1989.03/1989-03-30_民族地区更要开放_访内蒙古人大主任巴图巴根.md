Ethnic Regions Must Open Up Further

— An Interview with Batubagen, Chairman of the Inner Mongolia People's Congress

Reporter Yuan Jianda

Meeting with Batubagen, Vice Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee and Chairman of the Inner Mongolia People's Congress, the reporter's first question was, "The Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy has been in effect for nearly five years. What problems have you encountered in its implementation in Inner Mongolia?" This Mongolian cadre frankly said, "The issue of political equality has long been resolved, but there is still a significant gap in the implementation of economic and cultural policies. That is to say, some of the preferential economic development policies and certain autonomous powers granted by the law have not been fully realized."

Reform and opening up have brought noticeable changes to Inner Mongolia, gradually breaking the long-standing state of closure and semi-closure. However, due to the backward economic foundation and remote geographical location of ethnic minority regions, the pace of development naturally cannot compare with coastal areas. "If we do not actively implement the special policies and flexible measures for ethnic regions, the gap between ethnic regions and other regions will only widen!"

Batubagen excitedly told the reporter, "Implementing the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, the economy is the foundation, and education is the key. Coastal regions have achieved remarkable results in opening up to the outside world, so why can't ethnic regions open their doors even wider? I suggest that the central government establish a reform experimental zone in Inner Mongolia, paving a new path for solving China's ethnic issues in a Chinese way."

"The implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy has not been ideal. Apart from Inner Mongolia not fully utilizing the powers granted by the law, the more significant issue is that the relevant central government departments have not deeply studied and enforced the law."

Batubagen proposed: First, the state should promptly formulate the implementation regulations for the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy; second, the state's ethnic affairs management departments should genuinely perform their functions, establish an authoritative think tank on ethnic issues to provide detailed bases for decision-making; third, it is suggested that the central government convene a meeting of ethnic region leaders on the fifth anniversary of the promulgation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy to thoroughly discuss how to better and more realistically implement the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy.

　　民族地区更要开放        
    ——访内蒙古人大主任巴图巴根
    本报记者  袁建达
    见到内蒙古自治区党委副书记、自治区人大主任巴图巴根，记者提出的第一个问题是“民族区域自治法颁布已近五年，内蒙古贯彻执行中遇到哪些问题？”这位蒙古族干部坦率地说：“政治上平等问题早已解决，落实经济、文化上的政策还有很大差距。就是说，法律规定的经济发展的某些优惠政策和一部分自治权力，我们并没得到。”
    改革、开放给内蒙古带来了明显的变化，长期封闭、半封闭状态正逐步被打破。但是，由于少数民族地区经济基础落后，地理环境偏远，发展速度自然与沿海地区无法相比。“如果不去积极贯彻对民族地区采取的特殊政策、灵活措施，民族地区与其它地区的差距会越来越大！”
    巴图巴根激动地告诉记者：“贯彻民族区域自治法，经济是基础，教育是重点。沿海地区对外开放取得了令人瞩目的成绩，民族地区为什么不可以把大门开得再大些？我建议中央在内蒙古搞一个民族地区改革试验区，走出一条中国式的解决民族问题的新路子。”
    “民族区域自治法贯彻不够理想，除了内蒙古自身对法律赋予的有关权力运用不够外，更主要的是中央有关主管部门对民族区域自治法研究不深、执行不力。”
    巴图巴根建议：一、国家尽快制定民族区域自治法实施细则；二、国家民族主管部门切实履行职能，成立权威的民族问题“智囊团”，为决策提供详尽依据；三、建议中央在民族区域自治法颁布五周年之际，召开一次民族地区负责人会议，好好商量一下如何更好地、实事求是地贯彻执行民族区域自治法。
