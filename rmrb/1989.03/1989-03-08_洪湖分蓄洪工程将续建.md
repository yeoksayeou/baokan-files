The Honghu flood diversion project will resume construction. According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan on March 7th, the second phase of the large-scale Honghu flood diversion project in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River will commence construction this year, with an expected completion date of 1996.

The second phase of the Honghu flood diversion project mainly involves building roads for the evacuation of people, materials, and livestock during flood periods, communication networks, and flood gates within the diversion area. Upon completion of this project, even if a flood as severe as the one in 1954 occurs, it will ensure the safety of the Yangtze River during the flood season.

　　洪湖分蓄洪工程将续建
    据新华社武汉３月７日电  （通讯员胡碧辉）经国家计委批准，位于长江中游的洪湖大型分蓄洪第二期工程将于今年动工，预计１９９６年完工。
    洪湖分蓄洪二期工程，主要是兴建分蓄洪区内在分洪时的人口、物资、牲畜转移道路、通讯网络和兴建进洪闸等设施。这项工程完工后，即便出现１９５４年的特大洪水，也能确保长江安全度汛。
