Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 14th.

According to foreign news reports, Angela Taylor Isaakson, the holder of the world indoor records for the 50-meter and 50-yard dashes, admitted at a hearing in Toronto on March 13 that she had been using anabolic steroids and other banned substances for the past 10 years.

The 30-year-old Isaakson presented her diary at the hearing, which detailed the dates, types, and dosages of the drugs she had taken. In 1979, after losing to an East German athlete in a bilateral competition, Isaakson began experimenting with performance-enhancing drugs at the suggestion of her coach, Francis (who was also Johnson's coach).

Court officials deemed her diary to be a personal account and not admissible as public evidence.

　　加短跑名将承认１０年前开始服用禁药
    新华社北京３月１４日电  据外电报道，女子５０米和５０码跑室内世界纪录保持者、加拿大选手安吉拉·泰勒·伊萨因科１３日在多伦多举行的听证会上承认，早在１０年前，她就开始使用了类固醇一类的违禁药物。
    ３０岁的伊萨因科在听证会上出示了她的日记。日记中详细记载了她服药的日期、种类和剂量。１９７９年当她在一次双边比赛中负于民主德国选手后，经过同教练弗朗西斯（也是约翰逊的教练）商量，伊萨因科开始尝试服用药物以提高成绩。
    法庭官员认为，她的日记是个人经历的记载，不能作为公开的原始材料。
