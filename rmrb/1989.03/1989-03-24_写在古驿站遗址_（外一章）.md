Title: Written at the Site of an Ancient Post Station

The low wooden station house on the wasteland, enveloped in smoke, has long since collapsed. It has crumbled into the yellow weeds that sway and rustle in the harsh sunlight.

Reading this fragment of a poem, echoing with the faint sound of horse hooves, with its flat and oblique tones, my gaze transforms into the strings of a zither, playing a melancholic ancient song.

I have not seen the terrifying cannon fire that destroyed the station house. It is said that just as a postal courier set off on a snowy journey, the station house collapsed into the vast emptiness, and the talented scholars of the time wrote poems drenched in blood. Now, I cannot recall the experience of the station house turning into dust. Before me lies a moss-covered hitching post, like the severed arm of a warrior on the battlefield, making me ponder painfully.

The postal road that extended from the station house, the icy and rugged postal road, now stretches beneath my feet, winding and long, the snowy journey still endless.

Snowy fields, footsteps scattered
A letter with a blurred address, like a pale purple dove, flies over the waves of the strait, fluttering and lost in the morning light of the snowfields. In the bitter cold of minus 40 degrees, a burning curiosity instantly grows, like a banner rising in the hearts of the green-clad people!

Which small window should this eager inquiry knock open?
Which colorful screen should ripple with tears of joy?
On whose heart should this heavy longing alight?
Which wine cup should hold this intense sorrow of parting?

Thus, footsteps scatter, striking the strings of big and small roads. The distance between villages shortens. People with green missions on their shoulders wade through the frozen sunlight, seeking. Sweat buds and immediately solidifies in the pores. The chisel of the cold wind carves out the ideograms at the corners of the eyes.

I cannot remember how many times I have been in such suspense, nor can I recall how many times I have added a perfect annotation to the suspense. It is destined that I will be connected with suspense for a lifetime, and this time it is destined to be a riddle to solve. The net of footsteps, in one desolate region after another, fishes for hope, even if it catches nothing, it is cast out with hope...

　　写在古驿站遗址         
    （外一章）
    文乾义
    那荒原上矮矮的木刻楞站房，那炊烟缠绕的木刻楞站房，早已坍掉了。朝着天空的方向，坍成如今这一丛瑟瑟黄蒿，摇曳沙哑的阳光。
    读这阙荡着马蹄余音的断章，平平仄，平平仄仄，我目光幻化作筝弦，弹出悠悠古歌的悲怆。
    不曾见那骇人的大烟炮一掌击毁站房的情态，据说一个邮驿刚刚策马踏上雪程，站房就坍毁于迷茫的空白里，引流放的才子们呼出带血的诗行……而今，我无法追忆那站房变作泥土的经历，眼前躺一截布满苔藓的拴马青石，如沙场壮士的一截断臂，叫我痛苦地思量。
    那站房延伸出来的邮驿之路啊，那冰渍累累起伏的邮驿之路啊，如今正延伸至我的脚下，弯弯曲曲，雪程依然漫长……
    　　　　雪野，脚步纷纷
    一封地址模糊的信，如一只淡紫色的鸽子，飞越海峡的波峰浪谷，扑楞楞迷失于雪野的晨曦，零下４０度的寒潮里，顿时生长出焦渴的悬念，旗帜般在绿衣人心头升起！
    这急切切的问询该叩开那一扇小窗？
    哪一张彩色屏幕该漾出流泪的欣喜？
    这沉甸甸的思念该落脚于谁的心扉？
    哪一盏酒杯该盛下这浓烈的离愁别绪？
    于是脚步纷纷，敲响大路小路之弦，村落与村落之间缩短了距离。肩负绿色使命的人们，趟冻僵的阳光寻觅。汗珠发芽儿了，旋即凝固在毛孔里。寒风之刻刀，雕出眼角的象形文字。
    记不清有多少次置身于这样的悬念之中了，也记不起多少次为悬念加上了完满的注释。注定一辈子和悬念结下缘分，这一次注定又是解谜。脚步之网，于一片又一片失望的地域捕捞，即使捕不到，也带着希望撒出去……
