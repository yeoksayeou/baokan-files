Japan's GNP Grows by 5.7%
	Last Year's Highest Level in 15 Years

	Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 17

	Japan's Economic Planning Agency today released a preliminary report on national income statistics, stating that Japan's GNP growth rate in 1988 was 5.7%, the highest level in 15 years.

	The report indicates that Japan's economic growth in 1988 was primarily driven by domestic demand, including personal consumption and corporate investment in equipment. The total GNP for the year was 33,009.84 billion yen (approximately $257.5875 billion).

	Since November 1986, Japan's economy has been on a continuous upward trend for 28 months. Last year, due to the simultaneous growth of domestic and foreign demand, Japan's GNP growth rate increased from 4.5% in 1987 to 5.7%. This is the highest growth rate since 1973.

	However, there are concerns that with the implementation of a 3% consumption tax starting in April, Japan's consumer prices will generally rise, leading to potential inflation that could affect the sustained economic growth.

　　日国民总产值增长５．７％
    去年为１５年来最高水平
    新华社东京３月１７日电  日本经济企划厅今天公布的国民收入统计速报说，１９８８年日本的国民总产值实际增长率为５．７％，达到１５年以来的最高水平。
    这项统计说，１９８８年日本的经济增长主要是由内需，即个人消费和企业设备投资支持的。去年全年的国民总产值为３３００９８４亿日元（约２５７５８．７５亿美元）。
    日本经济自１９８６年１１月开始从谷底回升以来，迄今已持续扩大了２８个月。去年一年间，由于内需、外需两旺，日本国民总产值的增长率比１９８７年的４．５％又有所提高。这是自１９７３年以来最高的增长速度。
    不过，也有人担心，由于从４月份起要实施税利为３％的消费税制度，日本的消费物价将普遍上涨，由此而产生的通货膨胀势必影响景气的持续。
