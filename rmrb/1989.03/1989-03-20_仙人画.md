The Huairou Reservoir in Beijing is plain and unremarkable, yet its scenery is beautiful. Last year, to revise a manuscript, I stayed for over three months in a wide valley on the southern shore of the reservoir. Every evening after dinner, I would go to the reservoir with my colleagues. First, to relax, second, to enjoy the scenery, and third, to pick up stones. Picking up stones became a hobby in our leisure time.

The Huairou Reservoir has a unique type of stone. There are "fairies" who "paint" on these stones, depicting mountains and rivers, people, trees, and flowers. I jokingly call these "the fairy's paintings." Among the stones I picked up, there was one that looked exactly like a sketch of an ancient general, with a helmet, face, and cloak that seemed lifelike. I named it "Gazing at the Sky and Roaring." There was another stone that resembled the Yellow Mountains' "Dream Pen Blooming." There was also a stone that was even more extraordinary. Up close, it looked like an ink-wash landscape painting, but from a distance, it resembled an old man wearing a coat. Lü Jun said it looked like Qi Baishi. I joked that I would find the characters "Bai Shi" on the stone. Who would have thought that the stone did not disappoint me, and indeed, on the upper right side, I found what seemed like characters carved into the rock. Everyone was amazed, and laughter filled the room. Lü Jun picked up a stone that I truly envied. The stone was roughly in the shape of a square pillar, and one side looked exactly like a scroll of a landscape painting, with three lines of inscriptions, though the characters were indistinct. I decided to spend a few afternoons searching the nearby gullies under the scorching sun, but I could not find the stone again. Perhaps the heavens were displeased with my greed. Zhou Jun picked up stones depicting the four seasons: spring (flowers), summer (pines), autumn (chrysanthemums), and winter (plums). Wang Jun also picked up several good ones. In no time, everyone who went to the wide valley, men, women, old, and young, except for one or two who remained unmoved, all joined in the stone-picking activity to varying degrees. If we were to hold a small exhibition of the best stones we picked, it would be quite interesting.

Although there are many stones, the riverbank and the reservoir edge are covered with them, but it is not easy to pick up good ones. Over more than 100 evenings, plus sometimes not taking a nap in the middle of the day, just walking would cover hundreds of miles. After selecting from thousands, hundreds, and tens, finally, only a few are left, but these are indeed the cream of the crop among the stones! Stones are also a form of culture. They can symbolize virtue, convey emotions, be appreciated, and allow one to wander in the imagination. Some fine stones, such as Shoushan, Qingtian, Jixie, Balin, Duanshi, and Longwei, can be used for seals, inkstones, and carving other crafts, infusing human culture and enduring for a long time. As for stone inscriptions, their relationship with history and calligraphy is even greater, and they are indeed carriers of ancient Eastern culture.

　　“仙人画”
     敢峰
    北京怀柔水库平淡无奇，景致却美。去年为改一部书稿，在水库的南岸的宽沟住了三个多月，每天晚饭后都要偕同事们到水库边一游。一则散心，二来观景，三是捡石头。捡石头成了我们业余生活中的一种乐趣。
    怀柔水库有一种石头很奇特，石上有“仙人”作“画”，或似山水，或似人物，或似树木花草，我戏称为“仙人画”。在我捡的石头中，有一块酷似用素描画出的古代将军，头盔、面孔、披风栩栩如生，名之为“仰天长啸”；有一块酷似黄山的“梦笔生花”。还有一块更为奇绝，近看是一幅泼墨山水，远看是一位穿大衣的老人，吕君说很像齐白石，我开玩笑地说要在石头上找出白石二字来。谁知石不负我，果然在右上侧找到了，似字镌山岩上，举座惊讶，笑语不绝。吕君捡的有一块实在令我羡慕，石略成呈方柱形，其中有一面俨然是山水条幅，上面还有三行题款，唯字不可辨。我下决心花了几个中午的时间，顶着烈日到发现该石的附近一带沟壕中去找寻，却再也感动不了“上帝”，大概是嗔我心贪了。周君捡的有春（花）、夏（松）、秋（菊）、冬（梅）四景。王君也捡了几块颇好的。一时间，我们同去宽沟的人，男的，女的，老的，少的，除了一二人岿然不动外，大都不同程度地加入到捡石头的行列中来了。如果把捡得的佳石办一个小小的展览，还是挺有点意思的。
    石头虽多，河滩和水库边遍地皆是，但要捡到好石头也不容易。１００多个黄昏，再加上有时中午不睡觉，仅走路就有几百里，经过万中挑一、百中挑一、十中挑一，最后也就筛选出那么几块，但毕竟这是石中的精华啊！石头也是一种文化，可以喻德，可以寓情，可以观赏，可以神游其中。有些美石，如寿山、青田、鸡血、巴林、端石、龙尾等，还可用来治印、琢砚和雕刻其他工艺品，将人类的文化融注其中，流传久远。至于石碑雕刻，于历史与书法流传关系尤大，则更是东方古代文化之载体了。
