Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th. (Reporter Ding Jianming) Recently, the People's Court of Jinxian County publicly tried a serious case of an unlicensed pig dealer using violence to resist taxation and binding and beating tax officials.

On November 3rd last year, Lei Xiding, an unlicensed pig dealer from Meifangkou Village, Dengjia Township, Dongxiang County, purchased 46 live pigs in Jinxian County without a license and attempted to transport them privately. In the afternoon, when the pig transport vehicle passed by the Korqian Tax Bureau, it was intercepted. The tax officials, in accordance with state tax laws, urged the owner to pay taxes, but the owner, using the excuse that the vehicle needed to turn around, forcibly drove away. To ensure the state's tax revenue, the four tax officials from Korqian Tax Bureau immediately pursued the vehicle. When they caught up to the pig transport vehicle in Meifangkou Village, Dengjia Township, Dongxiang County, the tax officials found the driver of the pig transport vehicle, Lei Xiding's son-in-law Liu Rongmao, and demanded that he notify the owner to pay the taxes. However, Liu Rongmao, along with Lei Xiding's son Lei Shenglong and others, incited a small group of thugs to attack the tax officials, tearing their uniforms, destroying tax payment certificates and inspection certificates, and seizing their watches and other items.

Even more despicable was that after a round of punches and kicks, this group of thugs bound the four tax officials and stuffed them into the pig cages, mixing humans with pigs, and transported them to Xinjian Village, 2 kilometers away from the village. Along the way, the escorting personnel stood on the pig cages and urinated on the tax officials, committing a gross humiliation. Upon arriving at Xinjian Village, the thugs dragged the tax officials out of the pig cages and beat them, locking three of them in a dilapidated room and taking turns beating them for over five hours. When the police arrived at the scene, the thugs were still brazenly blindfolding the tax officials and parading them through the village. This case of violent resistance to taxation was serious, with clear evidence, and should have been handled promptly. However, due to the uncooperative attitude of certain leaders in Dongxiang County, the trial of the case was delayed.

Recently, after a public trial, the People's Court of Jinxian County ruled that Lei Xiding, Liu Rongmao, and Lei Shenglong used violence to resist taxation, insulted, and beat tax officials, with cruel methods, heinous acts, and serious consequences. Liu Rongmao's actions constituted the crime of tax resistance, while Lei Shenglong and Lei Xiding's actions constituted the crime of obstructing public order. Therefore, the People's Court of Jinxian County issued a first-instance verdict, sentencing Liu Rongmao and Lei Shenglong to three years in prison and Lei Xiding to one year in prison. At the same time, the Jinxian County Tax Bureau issued a decision to impose a fine of 23,116.1 yuan on Liu Rongmao and Lei Xiding for back taxes and penalties.

　　逃税行凶　国法不容
    江西公审暴力抗税案
    东乡县某些领导对办案竟持不合作态度
    据新华社北京３月７日电  （记者丁坚铭）日前，江西省进贤县人民法院公开审判了一起无证猪贩暴力抗税，并捆绑殴打税务人员的严重案件。
    去年１１月３日，东乡县邓家乡梅芳嘴村无证猪贩雷喜丁在进贤县收购生猪４６头，私自贩运。当天下午，当贩猪车途经进贤县衙前税务所时被查获。税务人员按照国家税法规定，动员货主纳税，但货主却借口车子要调头，强行开车逃跑。为保证国家的税收收入，衙前税务所的４名税务人员立即驱车追赶。当追至东乡县邓家乡梅芳嘴村时，税务人员找到了贩猪车司机雷喜丁的女婿刘荣茂，要求他通知货主补缴税款。然而刘荣茂却与雷喜丁的儿子雷盛龙等人一起煽动少数暴徒对税务人员大打出手，撕破税务干部的制服，撕毁税务完税证和检查证，并抢走了税务人员的手表等物件。
    更为恶劣的是，在一阵拳打脚踢之后，这伙暴徒又将４名税务人员捆绑着塞进了装猪的笼子里，人猪混装，转移到离这个村庄２公里的新建村，途中押运人员站在猪笼上向税务人员身上撒尿，进行大肆的人格侮辱。在到达新建村后，这伙暴徒又把税务人员从猪笼中拖出进行毒打，并把其中３名人员关在１间破房内轮换吊打达５个多小时。当公安人员闻讯赶至现场时，这伙暴徒竟然还明目张胆蒙住税务人员双眼游村。本来，这起暴力抗税案情节严重，证据确凿，理应得到迅速处理，但是由于东乡县某些领导采取了不合作态度，致使案件的审理难以进行。
    最近，江西省进贤县人民法院经公开审理后认定，雷喜丁、刘荣茂、雷盛龙等暴力抗税，侮辱、殴打税务人员，手段残忍，情节恶劣，后果严重。刘荣茂的行为已构成抗税罪，雷盛龙、雷喜丁行为已构成妨碍社会管理秩序罪。为此，进贤县人民法院一审作出判决，分别判处刘荣茂、雷盛龙有期徒刑３年，雷喜丁有期徒刑１年。同时进贤县税务局作出了对刘荣茂、雷喜丁补税、罚款２３１１６．１元的处罚决定。
