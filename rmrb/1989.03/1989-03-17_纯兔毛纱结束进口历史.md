Pure rabbit fur yarn, known as the "soft pearl," has recently been produced by the Shandong Provincial Zhobuo Huayuan Wool Textile Co., Ltd., marking the end of China's inability to produce pure rabbit fur yarn.

China's rabbit fur production accounts for 90% of the world's total, with Shandong Province contributing 40% of the national output. However, for a long time, China has only been able to export rabbit fur raw materials and blended yarns. All pure rabbit fur yarn used domestically has had to be imported.

　　纯兔毛纱结束进口历史
    本报讯  被称为“软珍珠”的纯兔毛纱，日前由山东省淄博华联毛纺织有限公司投产，结束了我国不能生产纯兔毛纱的历史。
    我国兔毛产量占世界的百分之九十，山东省兔毛产量占全国百分之四十。但长期来我国只能出口兔毛原料及其混纺纱，国内纯兔毛纱全部靠进口。
