For several days, the Jiangsu provincial delegation has been engaged in heated discussions, carefully reviewing Li Peng's government work report delivered at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress. Everyone spoke enthusiastically, discussing reforms and offering suggestions. Below are the speeches of a few representatives:

Lu Wenfu (Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, Honorary Chairman of the Suzhou Writers Association): I think that the desire for quick success and impetuousness are interrelated. Looking back at the path we have taken over the past few decades, we always start with high speed and then brake. Sometimes we are sober, sometimes we are confused. Such traditional work methods have flaws. Using campaign-style methods to manage the economy results in more short-term behavior and fewer long-term macro actions. I suggest that in propaganda, we should not only talk about boosting spirits but also maintain a sober mind. We should honestly tell the people about the difficulties so that they can be prepared to overcome them. We cannot be blindly optimistic.

Lu Bao (Director of the Astrophysics Research Room, Department of Astronomy, Nanjing University, Professor): I am very satisfied with the Premier's proposal in the government work report to "concentrate on rectification and adjustment." Only through rectification and adjustment can we ensure the development of science and technology. The report mentions that we should "step by step and focus on researching and developing high technology," and at the same time, "pay attention to and support basic research and applied basic research work." This issue was only mentioned in one sentence, but it was not clearly explained in conjunction with actual situations. I hope that those in charge of education will say more words that quench our thirst.

Gong Weixin (General Manager of Suzhou Xiangxuehai Electrical Appliance Company): Last year's government work report originally mentioned mistakes, but they were removed during the revision. This year, there is an awareness, but the understanding is not deep. Why? I think it might be that the higher-level leaders do not fully understand the situation below, do not conduct enough investigations, and do not sufficiently respect and absorb the voices of the masses.

Yang Zhimin (Town Mayor of Qianzhou Town, Wuxi County, General Manager of Qianzhou Town Industrial Company): Ten years of reform have brought great changes to our entire town. When we look at our achievements, we should not be overly joyful. When we look at difficulties, we should not be overly worried. Complaining and grumbling are of no use. Only by being sober can we rise again.

　　清醒才能再奋起        
    ——江苏代表审议政府工作报告实录
    本报记者  段存章
    一连几天，江苏省代表团分组热烈讨论，认真审议李鹏总理在七届二次全国人大会议上的政府工作报告。大家发言踊跃，说改革，提建议。下面是几位代表的发言：
    陆文夫（中国作家协会副主席、苏州市文联名誉主席）：我认为，急于求成与好大喜功分不开。回顾几十年走过的路，总是先开快车，然后刹车。一时清醒，一时糊涂。这样的传统工作方法就有毛病，用搞运动的办法搞经济，“短期”行为多，长期宏观行动少。我建议在宣传上既要讲振奋精神，也要保持清醒的头脑，应该把困难如实告诉人民，让人民有克服困难的精神准备，不能盲目乐观。
    陆埮（南京大学天文系天体物理研究室主任、教授）：我对总理在政府工作报告中提出“一心一意进行治理整顿”非常满意。只有在治理整顿中才能确保科技教育的发展。报告中说“要有步骤有重点地研究和开发高技术”，“同时，要重视与支持基础研究和应用基础研究工作”，这个问题只一句话提出来了，但没有结合实际论述清楚。我希望为我们办教育的多说几句解渴话。
    龚维新（苏州香雪海电器公司总经理）：去年政府工作报告中原讲到失误，修改时去掉了。今年有了认识，但思想上认识不深，为什么？我想，是不是上边的领导对下情不十分了解，调查研究不够，对群众呼声尊重吸收不够。
    杨志明（无锡县前洲镇镇长、镇工业总公司经理）：十年改革给我们全镇带来的变化大得很。我们看成绩不能喜过头，看困难不要愁破头，发牢骚，说怪话，无济于事，只有清醒才能再奋起。
