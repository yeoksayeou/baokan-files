From March of this year, more than 50 military legal advisory bodies across the entire army have had their legal advisors pass qualification reviews and officially become legal workers responsible for managing the military through law and protecting the legal rights of the military and military personnel. They are also protected by national laws. The Military Legal Advisors Office of the People's Liberation Army began operations on February 1st.

A joint notice issued recently by the Ministry of Justice and the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army states: Establishing a military legal advisors system is a measure taken by the military in the new era to adapt to deepening reform and opening up. It is an important step in strengthening the military's legal construction and administrative management.
