The functions of the People's Congress are essentially legislation and supervision. If it only legislates but does not supervise the implementation of laws, then the People's Congress is derelict in its duties.

Supervision—Arduous Tasks

Due to the fact that democracy and the legal system in our country are not yet fully developed, the law enforcement level of judicial organs is relatively low, and the quality of personnel is relatively poor, the tasks facing the People's Congress, as the highest organ of state power at the national and local levels, are even more arduous. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China explicitly stipulates the functions of the People's Congress: "The administrative, judicial, and procuratorial organs of the state are created by the People's Congress, are responsible to it, and are subject to its supervision." (Article 3 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China).

Recently, the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Dandong City, Liaoning Province, conducted an investigation into criminal law enforcement, reviewing a total of 709 case files handled by the public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs, and found that 96 cases were handled with excessive leniency or severity, of which 32 were handled in a seriously inappropriate manner.

From 1987 to 1988, the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Zhejiang Province received 421 letters from the public exposing and accusing judicial and public security personnel of illegal detention and torture. The failure to enforce the law, lax enforcement, and failure to investigate violations of the law have become obstacles to the development of a sound legal system and the promotion of democracy, especially in the judicial field.

The Constitution and local organizational laws stipulate that the state power organ—the People's Congress—exercises legal supervision and work supervision over the people's government and the courts and procuratorates at the same level. This is an important content and means to reflect the state's system of checks and balances, promote the construction of socialist democracy and legal system, and even the construction of national democratic politics.

The nature of the People's Congress exercising judicial supervision is the supervision by the state power organ over whether the state's judicial power is exercised in accordance with the law and effectively. The purpose is to ensure and promote the judicial organs to exercise the powers of investigation, prosecution, trial, and execution conferred by the Constitution and laws on these organs in accordance with the law and effectively, to prevent the abuse, infringement, or dereliction of power.

Supervision—Do Practical Work

Statistics show that since its establishment eight years ago, the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Tianjin Municipality has received a total of 17,000 letters of appeal from the people, and received 16,700 visits from the people, of which about 57% involved issues related to the enforcement of the law by judicial organs and their personnel.

However, in some places, letters and visits from the public are flying everywhere, and everywhere they go, the relevant units just transfer the letters and do not handle them, or even do not accept them.

During the interview, the reporter learned that the People's Congress also does practical work. On November 28, 1988, the Higher People's Court of Shanxi Province overturned the wrongful conviction of Wu Zhaoxiang, who had been sentenced to ten years in prison, and declared him not guilty. Twenty years ago, during the turmoil of the "Cultural Revolution," due to factional struggles, Wu Zhaoxiang, who was a middle school teacher in Puxian County, Shanxi Province, was detained by the county "public security, procuratorial, judicial, and military control group" and later was found to have raped four girls and sodomized five boys, and was sentenced to ten years in prison.

In April 1986, during the fourth session of the Shanxi Provincial People's Congress, Wu Zhaoxiang found the session's letter and visit group to appeal. After the court reviewed the case, the original verdict was upheld. Wu then appealed many times. In January of last year, the Provincial People's Congress sent people to listen to the review reports of the provincial, municipal, and county courts. The Linfen Intermediate Court said: "This case has been reviewed six times, the evidence is conclusive, the determination of the crime is appropriate, and the original verdict should be upheld." Jia Shenggui, director of the Provincial People's Congress Letter and Visit Office, proposed to review the case files. Later, it was found that there was only one piece of evidence that was insufficient to convict and sentence, and it was immediately decided that the Higher People's Court of the province would directly review the case. As a result, the Provincial Court finally determined that the original verdict's identification of Wu Zhaoxiang's crimes of sodomizing boys and raping girls lacked sufficient evidence and could not be established, and the original verdict was overturned.

When people's representatives conduct inspections, law enforcement inspections, or other forms of supervision, and raise criticisms and suggestions about the problems existing in law enforcement agencies, the key is to see whether the judicial organs implement them. Otherwise, supervision will become merely a formality.

Supervision—Calling for Laws

Some people describe the supervision of the People's Congress as "elastic supervision" or "soft supervision," relying on listening to reports, making suggestions, and issuing appeals, without the power to solve problems. This kind of supervision has no binding force on the supervised.

When it comes to cases where there are indeed errors and the court's opinion is different, the law has no provisions for handling such problems, and it often has to be handled according to the principle of consensus between the supervising and supervised parties. In fact, supervision can only be established and effective when the supervised party agrees. For example, for appeal cases, when the people's courts and people's procuratorates agree with the opinion of the People's Congress, the problem is easy to solve. If the two courts do not agree with the opinion of the People's Congress, the matter often remains unresolved.

People of insight believe that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress should, as soon as possible, formulate a supervision law to determine the scope, content, and procedures of supervision, improve the supervision mechanism, and unify the exercise of supervision powers.

It is understood that in some cities and counties, the People's Congress has made decisions that "when the court convenes the president's office meeting or the judicial committee to study major cases, it should notify the Standing Committee of the People's Congress, and the People's Congress should send people to attend according to the situation." However, the municipal court formally reported to the Standing Committee of the municipal People's Congress that it disagreed with this practice, citing the reason that there is no legal basis.

In some places, the resolutions passed by the People's Congress can be changed by the Party Committee with a stroke of the pen. The governors, mayors, and county magistrates of various places are all deputy secretaries of the same-level Party Committee, while the majority of the chairmen of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress are not even standing committee members. Therefore, supervising the government often fears supervising the Party Committee. How to properly handle the relationship between the Party Committee, the People's Congress, and the government is a problem that the People's Congress must encounter and should solve in the process of exercising supervision.

Some people believe that the People's Congress supervises the procuratorial and judicial organs, mainly in a macro-supervision manner, and should not be involved in cases or review case files. Otherwise, it would interfere with the "two courts" independent trial, becoming a "third trial." Indeed, the People's Congress at all levels generally feels that "too little supervision is feared to be derelict, and too much supervision is feared to be overstepping authority," so drafting a "supervision law" is an urgent matter.

It is worth celebrating that in recent years, many local People's Congresses have "felt their way across the river," striving to explore and practice legal supervision of law enforcement agencies. Tianjin, Guangdong, Jilin, Shanxi, and Taiyuan provinces and cities have successively formulated regulations or statutes for the implementation of legal supervision, providing some examples for the formulation of the national supervision law and making beneficial attempts.

　　人大监督机制亟需完善
    本报记者  毛磊
    人大作用无非是立法与监督两项。如果只立法，而不监督法律的贯彻实施，那么人大就是失职。
    监督——任务繁重
    由于我国民主与法制尚未健全、完善，司法机关的执法水平仍较低，人员素质较差，人大作为国家、地方最高权力机关，其面临的任务也就愈加艰巨。我国宪法中明文规定了人大的职能：“国家行政机关、审判机关、检察机关都由人民代表大会产生，对它负责，受它监督。”（中华人民共和国宪法第三条）。
    辽宁省丹东市人大常委会前不久进行刑事执法调查，共查阅公安、检察、审判机关处理的７０９件案卷，发现处理畸轻、畸重的达９６件，其中有３２件处理严重不当。
    浙江省人大常委会１９８７年至１９８８年共收到４２１封群众揭发和控告司法公安人员非法拘禁、刑讯逼供的信件，有法不依，执法不严，违法不究，已经成为当前健全法制、发扬民主的障碍，特别是司法领域尤为突出。
    宪法和地方组织法规定国家权力机关——人民代表大会对本级人民政府和法院、检察院实施法律监督和工作监督，这是体现国家的制衡机制，促进社会主义民主和法制建设乃至国家民主政治建设的重要内容和手段。
    人大行使司法监督的性质是国家权力机关对国家司法权是否依法和有效行使而进行的监督，目的在于保证和促进司法机关依法和有效地行使宪法和法律赋予这些机关的侦查、检察、审判、执行等权力，防止权力的滥用、被侵犯或者失职。
    监督——要办实事
    据统计，天津市人大常委会成立８年来，累计收到人民群众申诉信１．７万件，接待群众来访１．６７万人次，其中涉及司法机关及其工作人员执法方面问题的约占５７％。
    然而，有些地方群众来信来访满天飞，到处告，有关单位来信照转，受而不理，甚至不受理。
    记者在采访中了解到，人大也有办实事的。１９８８年１１月２８日，山西省高级人民法院为曾被判刑十年的吴兆祥平反冤案，宣告无罪。２０年前，恰是“文革”动乱年代，由于派性斗争，在山西蒲县担任中学教师的吴兆祥被县“公检法军管组”拘留，后被认定强奸少女４名，鸡奸男生５名，判处有期徒刑１０年。
    １９８６年４月，山西省人大四次会议期间，吴兆祥找到大会信访组申诉，经法院复查维持原判。此后吴又多次申诉。去年１月省人大派人就此案听取省、地、县三级法院复查汇报。临汾中级法院称：“此案已复查过６次，证据确凿，定性处罪恰当，应维持原判。”省人大信访处处长贾升贵提议复查案卷。后发现只有一个不足以科刑定罪的证明，当即决定由省高级法院直接复查。结果，省法院最后作出原判认定吴兆祥鸡奸男生和奸污女生的犯罪事实证据不足，不能认定，撤销原判。
    人民代表进行视察、执法检查，或其它形式的监督，对执法机关存在的问题提出批评和建议，关键是应看看司法机关是否落实，否则便会使监督徒具形式。
    监督——呼唤法律
    有人形容人大的监督是“弹性监督”或“软性监督”，靠听汇报、提建议、发呼吁，没有解决问题的实权。这种监督对被监督者无约束力。
    当涉及案件确有错误而与法院意见不一致时，法律没有处理这类问题的规定，往往只能按监督与被监督双方协商一致的原则办，实际上只有被监督者同意时，监督才能成立，才能有效。如对申诉案件，人民法院和人民检察院与人大意见一致时，问题易于解决，若两院不同意人大意见，常常不了了之。
    有识之士认为，全国人大常委会应尽快制定确定监督范围、内容和程序的监督法，完善监督机制，统一行使监督职权。
    据了解，有的城市区县人大作出决定，“法院召开院长办公会或审判委员会研究重大案件时应通知人大常委会，人大视情况派员列席。”而市法院向市人大常委会正式报告，不同意这一作法，理由是——无法律根据。
    有的地方，人大通过的决议，党委可以一笔改掉，各地省长、市长、县长都是同级党委副书记，而人大常委会主任多数连常委都不是，所以监督政府往往怕监督到党委头上。如何理顺党委、人大、政府三者的关系，是人大实行监督中必然遇到的和应该解决的问题。
    有人认为，人大监督检察、审判机关，主要是宏观监督，不能过问案件，也不必调阅卷宗，否则，就是干涉“两院”独立办案，变成“第三审”。的确，各地人大普遍感到“监督少了怕失职，监督多了怕越权”，因而，起草“监督法”是当务之急。
    值得欣喜的是，几年来许多地方人大“摸着石头过河”，努力探索和实践对执法机关的法律监督。天津、广东、吉林、山西和太原等省、市人大先后制定了实施法律监督的规定或条例，为全国人大监督法的制定提供了一些实例，作了有益的尝试。
