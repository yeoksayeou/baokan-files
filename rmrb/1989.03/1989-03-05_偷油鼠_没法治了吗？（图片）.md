Is There No Way to Stop the Oil Thieves?

On February 15 this year, the copper casing of Well 316 in the northern part of the Huabei Oilfield, specifically in the Langdong Oilfield, was stolen. The well blew out for over 10 hours, and the culprits fled. The local authorities demanded 100,000 yuan in compensation from the oilfield. Since September 1988, there have been seven incidents where lawbreakers have entered the oilfield to steal copper casings and release oil, causing farmland pollution and financial losses for the oilfield. The oilfield cries out: Why are there no effective measures to deal with these "oil thieves"?

    今年2月15日，华北油田北部廊东油田316井铜套被盗，井喷10多小时，不法者逃之夭夭，地方向油田索要赔款10万元。这个油田自1988年9月至今，不法分子进油田盗走油井铜套放油，造成农田污染、油田赔款的事已有七次了。油田喊冤：怎么就没有强有力措施来治一治“偷油鼠”！李建都摄
