The inflation rate in the United States is set to rise again? Recent economic indicators have sounded the alarm.

Economic prosperity, increased employment, and soaring food and gasoline prices

In January of this year, food and gasoline prices in the United States surged, with the consumer price index rising by 0.6%, equivalent to an annual rate of 7.2%. The wholesale price index for January also rose by 12.7% on an annualized basis. The operating rate of industrial enterprises has reached its highest level since 1979. Employment numbers continue to grow, and the unemployment rate has dropped from 5.3% last year to the current 5.1%, the lowest since May 1974.

Economic prosperity, increased employment, and a drop in the unemployment rate are not bad things. However, if these occur in the context of rising inflation, the situation becomes more complex. The author believes that the U.S. economy is currently facing such an unfavorable situation.

Inflation has long been seen as an incurable disease of modern industrial civilization. The double-digit inflation rates of the 1970s still haunt Americans. Historical experience shows that inflation often creeps in slowly, and by the time it is noticed, it is already deeply entrenched. In 1971, when the U.S. inflation rate exceeded 4%, President Nixon panicked and froze wages and prices, but ultimately failed. Inflation continued to worsen, and it was not until the severe economic recession of 1981-1982 that the situation was reversed. Therefore, every chairman of the Federal Reserve Board (central bank governor) has been extremely cautious in monitoring the slightest changes in inflation, constantly adjusting the money supply and interest rates to prevent inflation from spiraling out of control.

The recently released statistics have caused public concern because they emerged after the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, has been repeatedly warning about the dangers of inflation and implementing tight monetary policies since March of last year. Under this policy, the federal funds rate (the overnight borrowing rate between commercial banks) rose by more than three percentage points last year to 9.5%, but it still could not curb the overheating economy. Criticism of Greenspan for being "too slow and too weak" has been heard before. This time, he raised the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank from 6.5% to 7% to show his resolve. This increase in the base interest rate means that U.S. commerce and the economy will face greater constraints in the future, and the sensitive Dow Jones Industrial Average immediately plummeted. Major U.S. commercial banks such as Chase Manhattan Bank and Republic National Bank of New York also quickly acted, raising the prime rate twice this year after four increases last year, bringing it from 10.5% to 11.5%. In the face of rising interest rates, Greenspan solemnly reiterated to Congress: "If inflation reappears, I believe that the next recession will arrive faster than we anticipate, and once it erupts, it will last a long time."

Using high interest rates to cool down the overheating U.S. economy and controlling the growth rate of the U.S. GDP in 1989 to between 2% and 2.5% is Greenspan's strategy to combat inflation. However, this strategy is at odds with President Bush's economic policy.

President Bush reaffirms his commitment to maintaining economic growth

On the day before Greenspan announced the increase in the discount rate on February 24, newly appointed Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady publicly stated that he "has not found any strong evidence of an impending inflation." President Bush also echoed this sentiment, saying, "I do not want us to react too strongly out of concern for inflation and make judgments based on a single month's statistics."

In fact, the administration not only disagrees with Greenspan's assessment of the inflation situation but also wants him to pay attention to the harm that high interest rates can cause to economic growth. This is because Bush's promise during the election campaign, to balance the budget without raising taxes, was based on the assumption that U.S. interest rates would remain at a low level and the economy would continue to grow at a relatively high rate. This optimistic blueprint assumed that the U.S. interest rate in 1989 would be lower than in 1988, and the economic growth rate would reach 3.5%, rather than the 2.7% generally predicted by the business community. It was said that the federal government would therefore increase tax revenue by $80 billion, thus keeping the budget deficit below the legal limit of $100 billion by the end of the 1990 fiscal year. However, with the recent sharp increase in interest rates, the federal government, with a national debt of $2.6 trillion, will undoubtedly be forced to significantly increase interest payments, while its income will also decrease sharply due to the slowing economy. All of this makes Bush's newly compiled budget seem unreliable. In this situation, the more the president repeatedly declares "no tax increases," the more it raises doubts. As for the assumption in the budget plan that U.S. interest rates will continue to fall, thereby reducing government interest expenses, it is even further from reality. The actual situation is that the inflationary fiscal deficit policy and the tight monetary policy are at odds, each going its own way.

The president and Congress are passing the buck; two major deficits remain unresolved

Currently, the United States is in a stalemate over future budget policy between the president and Congress, with neither side willing to propose politically unpopular budget-cutting bills, and the president's "no tax increase" pledge is not being retracted. In this situation, no one can predict how large the future federal budget deficit will be. The U.S. budget deficit and trade deficit, the two major shortfalls, will remain unresolved for some time, and the standoff between the Republican president and the Democratic Congress will continue. It is no wonder that Mr. Greenspan is so worried about the potential inflation disaster in the United States and the possible further loss of international credibility.

In fact, the Federal Reserve's concern about inflation is not isolated. Today, most central banks in the developed world share this concern. It is expected that this concern will soon be reflected in central banks in Western Europe, Japan, and other countries raising their interest rates.

"Current inflation rates are unacceptable, let alone increasing."
— Greenspan

"I do not want us to react too strongly out of concern for inflation and hinder economic growth."
— Bush

　　美国：经济政策之争
    张根亚
    美国的通货膨胀率又要起跳了么？新近公布的一系列经济指标发出了警报。
    　　　　经济繁荣就业增加食品汽油价格猛涨
    今年１月，美国食品和汽油价格猛涨，消费物价指数上升０．６％，按年率计算为７．２％；１月份批发物价指数按年率计算上升１２．７％；工业企业的开工率已达１９７９年以来的最高水平；就业人数持续增长，失业率已从去年的５．３％降到目前的５．１％，为１９７４年５月以来的最低水平。
    经济繁荣、就业人数增加和失业率下降并非坏事。可是，如果是在通货膨胀率提高的情况下发生的，那就当别论了。笔者认为，目前美国经济正是面临这样一种不利的处境。
    通货膨胀曾被视为现代工业文明的一种不治之症。７０年代高达两位数字的通货膨胀率至今仍令美国人心有余悸。历史经验表明，它往往是缓缓来临，等到引起人们注意，早已积重难返。１９７１年美国通货膨胀率超过４％，尼克松总统就惊惶地冻结工资、物价，但最后仍以失败告终。以后通货膨胀愈演愈烈，经过１９８１—１９８２年的大紧缩和严重经济衰退，才算扭转了局势。因此，历届美国联邦储备委员会主席（中央银行行长）从来都是小心翼翼地监视着通货膨胀的细微变化，不断增减货币发行量并调整利率，以防止通货膨胀失控。
    　　　　格林斯潘发出警告力主控制通货膨胀
    刚刚发表的统计数字之所以立刻引起公众的不安，还因为它们是在现任美国联邦储备委员会主席艾伦·格林斯潘自去年３月起便不断警告通货膨胀危险，并采取了紧缩政策之后出现的。在这种政策驱使下，美国的联邦基金利率（商业银行之间的隔夜借贷利率）去年就曾提高３个百分点以上，达到９．５％，可是仍挡不住经济的过热。批评格林斯潘“动作过慢、措施太弱”之声早有所闻。这次他又把联邦储备银行的贴现率从６．５％提到７％以示决心。这项基本利率的上升意味着美国商业和经济今后将受到较大的遏制，于是敏感的纽约道·琼斯工业平均价格指数立刻发生暴跌；美国大商业银行如大通·曼哈顿银行和纽约共和国民银行也很快行动，继去年四次提高优惠利率之后，今年又连续两次提高这一利率，使之从１０．５％增加到１１．５％。在各种利率齐升的形势下，格林斯潘向国会郑重重申：“如果通货膨胀再度出现，我认为，下一次衰退的到来将比我们预料的为快，一旦爆发，延续的时间也将是很长的”。
    用高利率冷却美国过热的经济，将１９８９年美国的国民生产总值增长速度控制在２％至２．５％之间，这就是格林斯潘对付通货膨胀的方针。然而，这一方针却同布什总统的经济政策相左。
    　　　　布什总统重申诺言继续保持经济增长
    就在格林斯潘２月２４日宣布提高贴现率的前一天，新任命的财政部长布雷迪公开表示，他“并未发现任何爆发通货膨胀的有力证据”。布什总统也以完全赞同的口吻说：“我不希望我们因担心通货膨胀而作出过于强烈的反应，不能根据一个月的统计数字就做出判断”。
    其实白官不但不同意格林斯潘对通货膨胀形势的估计，而且还要他注意高利率对经济增长的危害。这是因为布什在竞选中所做出的既要平衡预算、又不增税的许诺，是建立在美国利率依然保持在低水平，经济继续以较高速度发展的基础之上的。这个乐观的蓝图曾假定１９８９年美国利率将较１９８８年有所下降，经济增长幅度将达到３．５％，而不是企业界一般预测的２．７％。据说，联邦政府因此会多增加８００亿美元的税收，从而在１９９０财政年度结束时，使预算赤字不超过法定的１０００亿美元的最高限额。但是随着目前利率的大幅度提高，国债已达２．６万亿美元的联邦政府无疑要被迫大大增加利息支出，同时，其收入也将因经济增长放慢而急剧减少。这一切都使布什总统新编制的预算变得不可信。在这种情况下，总统愈是一再申明“决不增税”，就愈是引起人们的怀疑。至于预算计划中所假定的美国利率会进一步下降，因而政府利息开支将减少的说法，就与事实相距更远。现实的情况是，膨胀性的赤字财政政策和紧缩性的货币金融政策背道而驰，各行其是。
    　　　　总统、国会踢皮球两大亏空悬而未决
    目前，美国在未来预算政策问题上正由总统和国会互相踢皮球，双方都不肯提出政治上不得人心的削减预算开支的法案，而总统“不增税”的诺言又决不收回，在这种情况下，未来的联邦预算赤字究竟是多少，谁也无法预言。美国的预算赤字、外贸赤字两大亏空在一段时期内仍将悬而未决，共和党总统与民主党国会的对峙仍将继续，难怪格林斯潘先生对美国未来的通货膨胀灾难和可能进一步丧失国际信誉的危险如此忧心忡忡。
    其实，美国联邦储备委员会对通货膨胀的忧虑决不是孤立的。今天世界大多数的发达国家中央银行都有同感。人们预料，这种担心不久就可能表现为西欧、日本等国的中央银行也纷纷提高它们的利率。
