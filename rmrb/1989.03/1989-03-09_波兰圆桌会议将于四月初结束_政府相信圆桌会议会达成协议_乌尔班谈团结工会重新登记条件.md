Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 7th.

The "Round Table Conference" involving representatives of various Polish social forces will be postponed until early April.

This was announced after a urgent meeting between Polish Interior Minister Kiszczak and former Solidarity leader Lech Wałęsa here today.

On March 2, Kiszczak and Wałęsa held their fifth meeting since the proposal to convene the "Round Table Conference" was made last year. They called on all parties to make concessions for the sake of national interests and to achieve national reconciliation. However, the recent small group and sub-group meetings have shown that the authorities and the Solidarity representatives have stuck to their own views, and the differences have not only not been eliminated but have further deepened.

According to a report by the Polish News Agency this evening, Kiszczak and Wałęsa exchanged views on the "differences." Both sides believe that there are conditions for further rapprochement on the main issues of dialogue and the direction of political, economic, and social reforms.

Both sides agreed to conclude the discussions of various small groups and sub-groups by March 20 and to hold the second plenary session of the "Round Table Conference" on April 3. It is reported that at this meeting, the representatives of all parties will sign a "joint declaration" and announce the closure of the "Round Table Conference."

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 7th.

Polish government spokesman Urban expressed his "disappointment" with the stance of Solidarity and other constructive opposition forces on economic and economic reform issues. However, he believes that the representatives of the "Round Table Conference" will ultimately "reach an agreement."

Urban made the above remarks at a press conference today when commenting on the progress of the "Round Table Conference."

He believes that the representatives of Solidarity only care about distribution issues during the discussion of Poland's economic situation and the implementation of economic reforms, but do not care about how to produce more to better solve the distribution problem. He said that the first thing to consider is how to boost production. Only then can we consider how to distribute it reasonably. Otherwise, it would be putting the cart before the horse. Urban criticized the Solidarity representatives' erroneous view of describing Poland's domestic economic situation as "pitch black" and "getting worse and worse."

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 7th.

The Polish government today said that as long as the representatives of Solidarity agree and guarantee non-confrontational parliamentary elections, the re-registration of Solidarity will be implemented.

Polish government spokesman Urban made these remarks at a press conference.

He said that the next parliamentary elections will be "very democratic," and that the election law will be amended before the elections, and suggested the establishment of a second chamber of parliament and a presidential system.

Urban pointed out that parliamentary elections involving various parties, social organizations, and constructive opposition forces may be held in June this year.

　　波兰圆桌会议将于四月初结束
    政府相信圆桌会议会达成协议
    乌尔班谈团结工会重新登记条件
    新华社华沙３月７日电  （记者汤德乔）由波兰各社会力量代表参加的“圆桌会议”将推迟到４月初结束。
    这是波兰内务部长基什查克与前团结工会主席瓦文萨今天在这里举行的一次紧急会晤后宣布的。
    ３月２日基什查克与瓦文萨举行了自去年提出关于召开“圆桌会议”建议以来的第５次会晤，呼吁各方代表从波兰国家利益出发，作出让步，以达成民族谅解。然而，最近几天的小组会和分组会情况表明，当局与团结工会代表各执己见，分歧不仅没有消除，反而进一步加深。
    据波通社今晚报道，基什查克同瓦文萨会晤时“就分歧的问题交换了意见”。双方认为，在对话的主要问题和政治、经济、社会改革的方向上双方的立场“存在进一步接近的条件”。
    双方同意３月２０日前结束各小组和分组讨论，决定４月３日举行“圆桌会议”第２次全体会议。据悉，在这次会议上各方代表将签署一个“共同宣言”，并宣布“圆桌会议”闭幕。
    新华社华沙３月７日电　波兰政府发言人乌尔班说，他对团结工会等建设性反对派在经济和经济改革问题上的立场“表示失望”。但他相信，“圆桌会议”代表最终“会达成协议”。
    乌尔班是在今天举行的记者招待会上评论“圆桌会议”进展情况时作上述表示的。
    他认为，团结工会代表在讨论波兰经济现状和经济改革实施过程中只关心分配问题，而不关心如何生产更多的东西，以便更好地解决分配问题。他说，首先应考虑如何把生产搞上去。然后才考虑怎样合理分配。否则就把事情本末倒置了。乌尔班批评团结工会代表把波兰国内经济形势说成“漆黑一团”和“越来越糟”的错误看法。
    新华社华沙３月７日电　波兰政府今天表示，只要团结工会代表同意并保证非对抗性议会选举，团结工会重新登记将付诸实现。
    波兰政府发言人乌尔班是在记者招待会上说这番话的。
    他说，下届议会选举将“十分民主”，选举前要修改选举法，并建议设立议会第二院和总统制。
    乌尔班指出，由各党派、社会团体和建设性反对派参加的议会选举可能在今年６月举行。
