The leaders of the State-Owned Coal Mine Corporation, including General Manager Yu Hong'en, visited the Huainan Mining Bureau in Anhui to address on-site issues and help resolve 34 practical difficulties in production and construction.

Huainan Coal Mine is one of China's famous old mining areas. In recent years, due to the decline of old mines and insufficient investment in new area construction, the situation has become serious with issues such as replacement disconnection, production decline, and economic losses, which has drawn the high attention of the State Council leaders.

Yu Hong'en and his delegation, carrying the concern of the State Council leaders for coal mine workers, visited production mines and construction sites despite the snow. They conducted on-site inspections and discussed production issues with cadres and workers. Through these inspections and discussions, they proposed solutions for problems in new area construction, old mine renovation, and financial aspects. They also ensured the repair costs for the Pan'er Mine shaft and the land acquisition fees for the first mining area subsidence, guaranteeing production handover by the end of this year.

Currently, Huainan Coal Mine has established a new production and construction plan based on the requirements of the on-site office meeting. It is expected that the annual coal production will reach 90 million tons, an increase of 50 million tons from the original plan, to alleviate the severe coal shortage in the country, especially in East China.

    统配煤矿总公司领导现场解难
    淮南矿确立建设新方案
    据新华社合肥3月1日电  （记者陈宝善）中国统配煤矿总公司总经理于洪恩等人到安徽淮南矿务局现场办公帮助解决了生产建设中存在的34个实际困难。
    淮南煤矿是我国著名的老矿区之一。近些年，由于老井衰退，新区建设投资不足，出现接替脱节、产量下降、经济亏损的严重状况，引起了国务院领导的高度重视。
    于洪恩等一行带着国务院领导对煤矿职工的关切之情，踏雪到生产矿井、基建施工工地进行了实地考察，并就生产问题与干部、工人座谈研究。通过考察和研究，分别对新区建设、老井改造、资金财务等方面的问题提出了解决办法。落实了潘二矿井巷道维修费和首采区塌陷征地费，确保今年年底移交生产等。
    目前，淮南煤矿已根据现场办公会议提出的要求，确立了生产建设的新方案，预计全年将产煤900万吨，比原计划增加50万吨，以缓解全国、特别是华东煤炭严重紧缺的局面。
