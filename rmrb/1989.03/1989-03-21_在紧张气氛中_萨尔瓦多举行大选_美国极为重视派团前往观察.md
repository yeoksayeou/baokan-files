    In a tense atmosphere,
    Salvador holds elections
    U.S. highly concerned, sends delegation to observe

    Yesterday, Salvador, located in Central America, held elections amidst fighting between the guerrillas and the government army. Reports indicate that at least 20 people were killed in the fighting, including 3 journalists covering the election.

    Due to the rejection of the guerrillas' proposal to postpone the elections, this election once again faced firm opposition from the guerrillas. A military spokesman said that on the evening of the 15th, the guerrillas launched attacks on government forces in areas such as Rusurután, Cavania, La Paz, and the capital. In the capital, San Salvador, gunfire and explosions could be heard all day yesterday. Despite the intense fighting, the election went ahead as scheduled, but a significant number of people were unable to vote.

    There were 7 presidential candidates participating in this election, but among them, the far-right candidate Alfredo Cristiani of the Nationalist Republican Alliance, the incumbent Christian Democratic Party candidate Chavez Mena, and Guillermo Ungo of the Democratic Alliance (a left-wing party coalition) have the potential to win.

    The U.S. authorities attach great importance to the Salvadoran elections, sending a delegation of 23 observers. U.S. Vice President Quayle stated on the evening of the 18th that regardless of which party wins, the U.S. government will work with them. However, public opinion suggests that if the far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance comes to power, it may cause discomfort in the White House and the U.S. Congress.

　　在紧张气氛中        
    萨尔瓦多举行大选        
    美国极为重视派团前往观察
    本报加拉加斯３月２０日电  昨天，地处中美洲的萨尔瓦多在游击队和政府军的战斗中举行大选。有消息说，至少２０人在战斗中死亡，其中有３名报道大选的记者也被打死。
    由于萨尔瓦多游击队提出的推迟大选的建议遭到拒绝。这次大选再次遭到游击队的坚决抵制。军方发言人说，游击队在１５日晚上向鲁苏鲁坦、卡瓦尼亚、拉巴斯和首都等地区的政府军发动了进攻。在首都圣萨尔瓦多，昨天整天都可以听到枪炮声和炸弹爆炸声。在这样严重的战斗气氛中，昨天的大选虽如期举行，但无法参加投票的人数相当高。
    参加这次竞选的共有７名总统候选人，但其中极右翼的民族主义共和联盟候选人阿尔弗雷多·克里斯蒂亚尼、执政的基民党候选人查韦斯·梅纳和民主同盟（左翼政党联盟）候选人吉列尔莫·温戈有获胜的希望。
    美国当局对萨尔瓦多大选极为重视，派出了一个由２３个观察员组成的代表团，美国副总统奎尔１８日晚表示，无论哪个党取胜，美国政府都将与其共事。不过舆论认为，如极右翼的民族主义共和联盟上台，可能引起白宫和美国国会的不快。
