The cherry blossoms begin to bloom in front of the white office building and around the hotel courtyard. Every spring, the blooming cherry blossoms are like the cherry blossoms in Ueno described by Mr. Lu Xun, "like a light pink cloud." My thoughts are like a light cloud carrying my memories.

The Guixi Smelter, adorned with cherry blossoms, is a modern large-scale copper smelting plant. Over the past six years, more than 200 Japanese experts have come here. Mr. Kaito Katsuo, who is nearly sixty, is one of them. He is the chief of the production technology and management team. His copper-colored face contrasts with his white hair. He inspects the lines, climbing up and down, his feet moving swiftly. Sometimes the young translator has to run to keep up. Every time he enters the workshop, he always holds a roll of yellow adhesive tape. As soon as he finds an open pipe, he seals it immediately. Once, Kaito found several young workers smoking in the operating room, and he was so angry that his features were distorted. He scolded them without hesitation. That year, the flash smelting furnace had just been ignited, and Kaito's elderly father suddenly passed away. He hurried back to Japan to attend the funeral. After completing the funeral, he rushed back to Guixi. The round trip from Guixi to Tokyo takes 4 days, but he only left for 7 days. He couldn't rest easy with the flash smelting furnace gradually heating up. Soon, the flash smelting furnace successfully produced copper. Under the glow of the flowing red copper, his face was like a blooming cherry blossom, and his eyes sparkled with waves of relaxation and joy.

Sincerity begets sincerity, and friendship intertwines with friendship. Whenever a Japanese expert's birthday comes, the hotel staff will bring him a beautifully made cake to celebrate. The experts are moved, rubbing their hands and thanking repeatedly, "I really didn't expect this, it's too thoughtful! It's just like being at home." Once, Mr. Okada accidentally fell and fractured a third of his left clavicle. The factory immediately sent him to a nearby military hospital for surgery. Skilled medical treatment and meticulous care ensured that Okada's fracture soon reached the first stage of healing, with no deformities. Okada was moved, and people saw him working even harder on the site, guiding Chinese technical personnel more carefully and seriously. This is a silent act of friendship, requiring no elaborate words.

Cherry blossoms bloom and wither; swallows come and go. Guixi Smelter successfully went into production, and the Japanese experts were about to return home. Chinese experts and technical personnel took turns inviting the Japanese experts to their homes, making dumplings, and expressing their farewell sentiments. The Japanese experts gave their Chinese counterparts blueprints, documents, and some equipment they brought with them, saying emotionally, "You are welcome to visit Japan, welcome to my home, I will personally cook Japanese dishes for you..." They also invited them to admire the cherry blossoms under the cherry trees. The warm spring breeze bloomed the cherry blossoms on the trees. It was not known which Japanese expert could not help but hum the famous old song "Cherry Blossoms":

"Cherry blossoms, cherry blossoms,
Late spring in March,
Blooming under the clear sky,
Endless in sight.
The fragrance fills the air,
Like clouds and rosy clouds,
Go, go,
Let's admire the cherry blossoms together!"

　　樱花初绽
    马平
    白色办公大楼前，宾馆庭院的周围，一到春季，盛开的樱花，就正如鲁迅先生所写的上野的樱花，望去“像绯红的轻云，”我的思絮也如同轻云托着思念。
    缀满樱花的贵溪冶炼厂，是一座现代化大型铜冶炼厂，六年多来，陆陆续续来过２００多名日本专家。年近花甲的柴田幸男先生就是其中之一。他是生产工艺和管理方面的工艺组长，紫铜色的脸庞衬着满头白发，巡检线路，爬上爬下，两脚嗖嗖生风，青年翻译有时要小跑才能跟上。每回进工地，他手里总是拿着一卷杏黄色的的胶布，一发现有敞开的管口立即封住。有一次，柴田在操作室发现有几位青工抽烟，顿时恼怒得五官错位，不客气地甩出了一串训斥。那一年，闪速炉刚点火不久，柴田的老父亲突然病故，他赶忙回国奔丧。料理完后事，又风风火火地回到贵冶。贵溪到东京，路程往返就需４天，可他总共只离开了７天就赶了回来。他放心不下正在逐渐升温的闪速炉。不久，闪速炉顺利出铜了，在奔泻的红彤彤的铜水照耀下，他的脸像盛开的樱花，眼睛里泛起阵阵轻松欢快的涟漪。
    真诚赢得了真诚，友谊交织着友谊。来厂的每位日本专家只要生日一到，宾馆的师傅就会为他端上一盘精制的蛋糕，表示祝贺。专家感动地搓搓手，连声道谢：“真是没有想到，太费心了！这真是像在家里一般。”冈田先生一次不小心摔倒，左锁骨的三分之一部位发生粉碎性骨折，厂里立即把他送到附近的军医院作手术。精湛的医术，细致的照料，冈田的骨折不久就达到了一期愈合，而且没有任何畸形。冈田感动了，人们看到他在现场工作更加努力，指导中国技术人员更加细心认真。这是一种无言的友好行动，用不着任何华丽的词藻。
    樱花，花开花谢；燕子，飞去飞来。贵冶顺利投产，日本专家即将回国，中国专家和技术人员轮番请日本专家到家里做客，包饺子吃，叙惜别之情。日本专家把图纸和资料，以及带来的一些器材送给自己的同行，席间动情地说：“欢迎一定到日本去看看，欢迎到家里来做客，我要亲手做日本菜给你吃……”并相邀一同到樱花树下赏花。和煦的春风吹绽满树的樱花，不知是哪位日本专家情不自禁地哼起了那首著名的古谣《樱花》：
    “樱花，樱花，
    暮春三月，
    开满晴空，
    一望无涯。
    花香四溢，
    如云似霞，
    去呀，去呀，
    同赏樱花！”
