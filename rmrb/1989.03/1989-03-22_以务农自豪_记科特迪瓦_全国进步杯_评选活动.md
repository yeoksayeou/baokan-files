In Côte d'Ivoire, being a farmer is something to be proud of. President Houphouët-Boigny often says that the economic achievements since independence "are all thanks to the hands and sweat of the farmers." He calls himself the "farmer president" and the "first farmer," and has a large farm in his hometown. Many ministers are also "part-time farmers." After retiring, officials often happily return to the countryside to lead a rural life, not lingering in the big cities. To encourage farmers to develop agricultural production and actively participate in rural construction, since 1967, Côte d'Ivoire has also launched the "National Progress Cup" agricultural competition nationwide.

Recently, after more than 40 days of intense evaluation, the National Selection Committee has announced the list of winners for the 1987-1988 "National Progress Cup." The winners include both individuals and collectives. This is the 10th agricultural competition, and also the one with the most participants. A total of 5,914 farmers, 591 rural cooperatives, 1,157 villages, and 124 counties participated in the competition. The selection process adopts a bottom-up, layer-by-layer screening method. Winners can all receive a prize and other awards. The national first-place individual winner's prize money is quite substantial, amounting to 10 million West African francs (approximately $30,000), and is also awarded the "National Medal" and the "Agricultural Medal."

Whether it is an individual or a collective, the selection criteria are very strict. Advanced farmers are not only evaluated based on their cultivation methods, planting area, total yield, and yield per unit area, but also on their role in the local social and economic development. How much they save, the education of their children, and whether they have patriotism and a sense of responsibility are also conditions for selection.

The individual first-place winner this year is Pascal, a 51-year-old farmer from Niablé in the eastern region. In the past, he was a jeweler, but his income was not enough, so he returned home to farm and opened his first plantation. Over the years, his plantation has grown from small to large, and his income has increased year by year. Now he manages 55 hectares of cocoa, 24 hectares of coffee, and also grows a lot of grains, vegetables, and tropical fruits. Last year, he produced 40 tons of cocoa and 24 tons of coffee, and the income from these two items alone exceeded 20 million West African francs. The village that was awarded the first-place village prize is Soubré in the northern region. This village is located in a barren valley, and in the past, it was just a cluster of dilapidated traditional African round thatched huts. Now the landscape has changed dramatically. The valley is full of greenery, the slopes are covered with cattle and sheep, and new houses shine brightly in the sunlight. There are schools, shops, and "youth centers," making it almost like a small city.

The launch of the "National Progress Cup" agricultural competition has greatly boosted the enthusiasm of the broad masses of planters and activated the social and economic life of the countryside. To organize the biennial selection activity well, the Ministry of Agriculture has set up the "National Progress Cup" Bureau. This bureau also broadcasts and televises programs for farmers and publishes a free newspaper, *Land and Progress*, distributed to farmers. The head of this bureau, Mr. Durey Wey, when accepting an interview with a reporter, said: "In the many measures to achieve social development and economic prosperity in rural areas across the country, the 'National Progress Cup' must undoubtedly be written in gold."

　　以务农自豪        
    ——记科特迪瓦“全国进步杯”评选活动
    本报记者  杨汝生
    在科特迪瓦，做一个农民是会感到自豪的。博瓦尼总统经常说，国家独立后所取得的经济建设成就“全靠农民的双手和额头的汗水”。他自称是“农民总统”、“第一农民”，在家乡还有一个大庄园。许多部长也“亦官亦农”。官员们退休后，大都乐意回乡过田园生活，并不留恋大城市。为了激励农民发展农业生产，积极参加乡村建设，自１９６７年起，科特迪瓦还在全国开展进步杯农业竞赛活动。
    不久前，经过４０余天的紧张评比工作，全国评选委员会已将１９８７—１９８８年“全国进步杯”优胜者名单公布于众。获奖者中有个人，也有集体。这是第１０次农业竞赛活动，也是参加者最多的一次。参加竞赛的共有５９１４个农民，５９１个农村合作组织，１１５７个村庄和１２４个县。评选活动采取自下而上、层层筛选的办法。优胜者都可得到一份奖金和其他奖励。全国第一名个人获奖者的奖金十分可观，高达１０００万西非法郎（约合３万美元），还被授予“国家勋章”和“农业勋章”。
    不论是个人还是集体，评选条件都极其严格。先进农民不仅要看其耕作方式、播种面积、总产量和单位面积产量，还要看他在本地社会和经济发展中所起的作用。储蓄多少、子女就学情况、是否具有爱国心和责任感，同样是评选的条件。
    荣膺今年个人一等奖的巴斯卡勒是东部地区尼阿布雷的农民，今年５１岁。过去，他曾作过首饰匠，但入不敷出，后来回家务农，开辟了自己的第一个种植园。十几年来，他的种植园由小到大，收入也逐年增多。现在他共经营５５公顷可可，２４公顷咖啡，还种了不少粮食、蔬菜和热带水果。去年他共生产了４０吨可可和２４吨咖啡，只此两项的收入就超过２０００万西非法郎。被评为村庄一等奖的是北部省份的索乌奥村。这个村子地处一个贫瘠的谷地里，过去只是一片破旧的非洲传统圆型茅草房，现在面貌大变。满谷绿荫，遍坡牛羊，一幢幢新居在阳光照射下熠熠生辉，有了学校、商店、“青年之家”，简直像个小城市。
    “全国进步杯”农业竞赛活动的开展，大大鼓舞了广大种植者的积极性，活跃了农村的社会和经济生活。为了组织好这两年一度的评选活动，农业部专设了“全国进步杯”局。这个局还开办了面向农民的广播和电视，编了免费赠送给农民的报纸《土地与进步》。这个局的负责人杜雷·韦伊先生在接受记者采访时说：“在为实现全国农村地区的社会发展和经济繁荣的诸多措施中，毫无疑问地要用金字写上‘全国进步杯’”。
