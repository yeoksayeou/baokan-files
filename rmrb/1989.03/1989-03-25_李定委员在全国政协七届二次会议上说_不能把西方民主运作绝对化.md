	Li Ding, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said at the second session of the seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that it is wrong to absolutize Western democratic operations and regard them as models to be copied. He believes that implementing Western two-party or multi-party systems in China is completely detached from China's national conditions.

	Li Ding said, "I believe that any foreign experience, whether it is scientific and technological, managerial, or political operations, that is suitable for China's national conditions and beneficial to China's development, can and should be borrowed and absorbed. However, we must not blindly copy Western systems. Whether Western democracy is truly democratic, we will not delve into, but the extreme individualism that only cares for personal interests is now considered a major problem even by some Westerners. If we promote such ideas, our country and nation will regress to a state of 'disunity.' This is also why we resolutely abolished the 'four big freedoms' that were prevalent during the Cultural Revolution. I believe that advocating for Western two-party or multi-party systems in China is completely detached from China's national conditions, with neither the conditions nor the necessity. It will not only fail to promote China's democratic political construction but will instead lead to social turmoil, ultimately harming the construction of socialist democratic politics."

	Li Ding said, "Currently, our country is in a transitional period between old and new economic orders, and in the next few years, we face the arduous task of rectification and adjustment. Under such objective conditions, our political system reforms and various reform measures must be conducive to stability and unity. The development history of various countries in the world shows that a country is most prone to social unrest during the transition from a traditional society to a modern society. Those who think that emphasizing stability and unity means suppressing people's voices and not allowing democratic demands to be raised do not reflect the facts. Maintaining stability and unity does not contradict democracy. Modern democracy is democratic rule of law and orderly democracy. Modern countries practice democracy within the scope of the constitution, with adherence to the constitution as a prerequisite, including citizens' freedom of speech, publication, news, etc., all of which cannot violate the constitution."

	Li Ding said, "In the past ten years, there are still areas in our democratic political construction that are not satisfactory. However, just like economic system reforms, we are also making solid progress in democratic political construction."

### 李定委员在全国政协七届二次会议上说  不能把西方民主运作绝对化

　　李定委员在全国政协七届二次会议上说        
    不能把西方民主运作绝对化
    新华社北京３月２４日电  全国政协委员、全国工商联副主席李定在此间召开的全国政协七届二次会议上说，把西方民主运作绝对化并奉为必须照抄的模式，谁不照抄就是“不民主”，这至少是一种脱离中国实际的武断的说法。他认为，在中国实行西方的两党制或多党制完全脱离中国国情。
    李定说，我认为，凡是适合中国国情、有益于中国发展的外国经验，不论是科学技术、管理经验还是政治运作，都可以而且应当借鉴、吸收。但是，决不能照搬西方的一套。西方的那一套究竟有多大的民主，我们姑且不去深究，但是那种只顾个人利益的极端个人主义，现在连一些西方国家的人士也认为是一大祸害。如果我们也鼓吹那一套，我们的国家和民族就会倒退到“一盘散沙”的可悲境地。这也是我们为什么坚决取消了“文化大革命”中盛行的“四大”的原因。我认为，在中国，要求实行西方的两党制或多党制，完全脱离中国的国情，既无条件，也无需要。它非但不能促进中国的民主政治建设，相反会导致社会动乱，其结果必然要损害社会主义民主政治的建设。
    李定说，目前我国正处在新旧两种经济秩序的转变时期，今后几年面临着治理、整顿的艰巨任务。在这样一种客观条件下，我们的政治体制改革和各项改革措施，必须有利于安定团结。世界各国的发展历史表明，一个国家在从传统社会向现代社会的转变时期最易引起社会动荡。认为我们强调安定团结就是堵了人们的口，就是不让提出民主要求，这不符合事实。保持安定团结与民主并不矛盾。现代民主是法制的民主、有序的民主。现代各国实行民主，都是在宪法规定的范围内，以遵守宪法为前提的，包括公民的言论自由、出版自由、新闻自由等等，都不能违背宪法。
    李定说，我们这十年在民主政治建设方面也还有不能尽如人意的地方。但是和经济体制改革一样，我们在民主政治建设方面，同样也在扎扎实实地前进。
