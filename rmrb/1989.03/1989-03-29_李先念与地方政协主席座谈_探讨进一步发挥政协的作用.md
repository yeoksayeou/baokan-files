Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), held a discussion with chairpersons of CPPCCs from various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government this afternoon. The main topic was how to further enhance the role of the CPPCC during the period of rectification and austerity.

The meeting was held in the third-floor grand hall of the National CPPCC. Li Xiannian, along with Vice Chairpersons Wang Renhe and Yan Mingfu, and Secretary-General Zhou Shaozhen, listened attentively to the opinions of the local CPPCC representatives.

Wang Renhe spoke at the meeting, emphasizing that the purpose of political consultation and democratic supervision is to assist the Party and the government in their work, not to find faults. He called for a spirit of unity and hard work to fully utilize the CPPCC's role in managing state affairs effectively.

Wang Renhe also stressed the importance of conducting political consultations in a harmonious atmosphere. He noted that while the opinions expressed during the Seventh National Committee of the CPPCC's Second Session were generally good, some criticisms lacked objectivity. He encouraged the CPPCC to allow for differing opinions and to engage in democratic debates. He emphasized that the CPPCC should maintain an attitude of seeking truth from facts, treating others equally, and persuading with reason in all its activities, whether through investigations, group discussions, or speeches at plenary sessions.

During the discussion, the local CPPCC chairpersons commented that "CPPCC work is becoming increasingly important and active each year, but it still cannot meet the needs of development." They also shared their views on strengthening the CPPCC's thematic investigations, mobilizing the enthusiasm of committee members, and improving the leadership of local CPPCCs.

Wang Zhuo, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial CPPCC, suggested that the National CPPCC's thematic investigations in 1989 should focus on prominent issues in the rectification and austerity period, such as prices, clean governance, and public security. He emphasized that the CPPCC should adhere to principles, dare to address issues that concern the public, and propose solutions.

Liu Zheng, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial CPPCC, proposed that the "Provisional Regulations on Political Consultation and Democratic Supervision" adopted by the National CPPCC Standing Committee represent a step towards regularizing and institutionalizing political consultation and democratic supervision. He suggested that the CPPCC should continuously practice and summarize its experiences to enrich and improve these regulations. He also recommended that future speeches at CPPCC plenary sessions should be of high quality, avoiding irresponsible statements. He stressed the need to strengthen organizational work to better utilize the CPPCC's overall role and to provide effective guidance for local CPPCC work.

During the discussion, Li Xiannian, Wang Renhe, and Yan Mingfu frequently interjected, creating a lively atmosphere. When discussing the work of county-level CPPCCs, Li Xiannian mentioned that the country is poor and the financial situation is tight, so it is necessary to streamline institutions to concentrate financial and material resources on economic construction.

Yan Mingfu briefed the attendees on the progress of political system reform. He mentioned that an important aspect of this year's reform is to strengthen and improve the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. He hoped that local CPPCCs would share their successful practices and experiences with the National CPPCC to enrich and improve the reform plan.

The meeting began yesterday and was attended by nearly 100 chairpersons and vice chairpersons of CPPCCs from various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and cities with separate planning status.

　　李先念与地方政协主席座谈        
    探讨进一步发挥政协的作用
    新华社北京３月２８日电  （记者邹爱国、池茂花）在治理整顿中，如何进一步发挥人民政协的作用？这是今天下午全国政协主席李先念与各省、自治区、直辖市政协主席座谈会主题。
    座谈会在全国政协礼堂三楼大厅举行。李先念和王任重、阎明复副主席，周绍铮秘书长，认真听取了来自地方政协同志的意见。
    王任重在会上说，政治协商、民主监督的目的是帮助、协助党和政府做好工作，不是专找岔子。这就需要我们振奋精神，努力工作，充分发挥政协的作用，把国家的事情办好。
    王任重说，政治协商要在团结的气氛中进行。全国政协七届二次会议上委员们提出的意见总的说来是好的，但是，有的批评并不实事求是。政协要允许不同意见的争论，争论也是发扬民主。政协不论是调查研究、小组讨论、大会发言，都要持实事求是的态度、平等待人的态度、以理服人的态度。
    座谈会上，各地政协主席用“政协工作一年比一年重要，一年比一年活跃，政协工作满足不了发展的需要”，来评价人民政协的工作。大家还就如何加强政协的专题调查、调动委员的积极性、加强对地方政协的领导等问题，各抒己见。
    黑龙江省政协主席王钊在发言中建议全国政协１９８９年的专题调查要抓住治理、整顿中的突出问题进行，如物价、廉政、治安等。他说，政协要坚持原则，不要怕得罪人，要敢于对群众反映强烈的问题进行调查研究，提出解决办法。
    湖南省政协主席刘正在发言中提出，全国政协常委会通过的《关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定》，向政治协商、民主监督经常化、制度化方向迈出了一步，我们还要不断实践、不断总结，使这个规定不断充实和完善。他建议，今后政协大会发言要提高质量，不能发表不负责的言论。要加强组织工作，更好地发挥政协的整体作用，切实加强对地方政协工作的指导。
    座谈时，李先念、王任重、阎明复等不时插话，气氛十分活跃。谈到县级政协的工作时，李先念说，我们国家穷，财政紧张，机构一定要精简，以便集中财力、物力搞经济建设。
    阎明复在会上向大家介绍了政治体制改革的情况。他说，今年政治体制改革的一个重要内容是：加强与完善中国共产党领导的多党合作制。他希望各地政协将自己的好作法、好经验，汇总到全国政协，以便丰富和充实这个研讨方案。
    这次会议是昨天开始举行的。近百名各省、自治区、直辖市及计划单列市的政协主席、副主席，出席了会议。
