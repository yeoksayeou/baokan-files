Philippine House Speaker Ramon Mitra today stated that he would not allow the passage of the "Mutual Benefit Relations with Taiwan Act," which aims to establish formal relations between the Philippines and Taiwan.

Mitra said in an interview with reporters today that the "Mutual Benefit Relations with Taiwan Act" is an attempt to establish a "two Chinas" policy, which we firmly oppose.

He said that this bill has only passed through the Asia-Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the House of Representatives and has not yet been approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Therefore, it cannot be discussed in the House of Representatives.

　　菲律宾众院议长表示        
    反对通过《对台互惠关系法》
    新华社马尼拉３月３０日电  菲律宾众议院议长拉蒙·米特拉今天在这里表示，他将不允许通过旨在菲律宾与台湾建立正式关系的《对台互惠关系法》。
    米特拉今天在接受记者采访时说，《对台互惠关系法》是“企图制定两个中国的政策，我们决不答应。”
    他说，这项草案仅在菲众议院亚太事务小组委员会通过，它还没有得到众议院对外关系常务委员会的批准，因此不能在众议院进行讨论。
