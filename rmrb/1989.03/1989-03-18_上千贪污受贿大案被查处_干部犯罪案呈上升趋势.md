Over a thousand major cases of embezzlement and bribery have been investigated

    Over a thousand major cases of embezzlement and bribery involving amounts of 10,000 yuan or more have been investigated by the procuratorial organs across the country since last year. Among these, eight cases involved officials at the bureau or division level and above, and over a hundred cases involved officials at the section chief level and above. According to officials from the Supreme People's Procuratorate, cases of embezzlement and bribery by leading cadres are on the rise.

    Most of the criminals investigated held certain managerial positions in their units. They took advantage of their official positions to extort money from cooperating units, especially from township enterprises, construction teams, and individual entrepreneurs who sought their help, engaging in extensive embezzlement and bribery activities.

    In the cases investigated last year, there was a noticeable increase in crimes involving collusion between insiders and outsiders, coordination between superiors and subordinates, and gang-related activities. In Beijing, the Haidian District Urban Construction Company was found to have committed a major embezzlement case involving 37 criminals, including party members, cadres, material clerks, and warehouse keepers, as well as individual entrepreneurs and other individuals from society. They committed multiple crimes in collusion, and the procuratorial organ has already seized 270,000 yuan in illicit funds.

　　上千贪污受贿大案被查处
    干部犯罪案呈上升趋势
    本报北京３月１７日讯  记者徐如俊报道：据最高人民检察院有关官员透露：去年以来，全国各地人民检察机关共查处万元以上的重大、特大贪污受贿犯罪案件上千起，其中涉及厅、局级以上干部的８起，处级以上干部上百起。从各地查处的案件分析，领导干部贪污受贿犯罪案件呈上升趋势。
    被查处的大多数犯罪分子在作案单位都掌握一定的管理权。他们利用职务之便，对协作单位，尤其对有求于己的乡镇企业、建筑队、个体户，恣意勒索，大肆进行贪污、受贿犯罪活动。
    在去年查处的案件中，犯罪分子内外勾结、上下串通、结伙作案明显增多。北京市查处的海淀区城建一公司特大贪污案，共有案犯３７名，其中有党员、干部、材料员、保管员，还有个体户和社会上的其他人员。他们数罪交织，勾结作案，检察机关现已收缴赃款达２７万元。
