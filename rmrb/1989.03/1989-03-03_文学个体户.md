	“Literary Entrepreneurs”
	By Xǔ Hóngzhì, Text by Jǔ Gēnhuá, Illustrations

	It is not clear when it began, but on the famous pedestrian street Arbat in Moscow, some unusual "vendors" started to appear. They set up stalls here to sell their own "products"—novels and poems they wrote and self-published. Konstantin Mikhailovich Belov is one such "self-produced, self-sold literary entrepreneur."

	As long as the weather is good, he is sure to bring a box of his short story collections to sell here. Opening the cover, the title page reads "self-published" and includes the year and place of publication: 1988, Moscow, Art Publishing House. Occasionally, curious passersby stop by his stall and ask various questions: "Do you have anything about Stalin?" "Do you have anything about reform?" He always replies that he is not a member of the Writers' Union and does not write that kind of book. He writes novels reflecting the lives of ordinary people.

	Belov is a mathematician, but he has loved literature since childhood. It was only in middle age that he began to write novels. After completing a long novel, he found that writing the book was only half the job; the difficulty of getting it published was no less than the writing itself. So, he began the "arduous journey" of seeking publication. Because his long novel had a bit of a satirical tone, to get the publisher to accept it, he added a few optimistic short stories, compiling them into a collection.

	The publishing house held onto his manuscript for seven years. Belov was almost desperate and decided to give up writing altogether.

	However, Belov's wife Olga was not willing to give up. She ran around everywhere to get her husband's book published and finally succeeded. Last spring, Belov's first collection of novels was published by the Soviet Writers' Publishing House. Belov was very grateful to his supportive wife and decided to give her all the royalties.

	Olga accepted the gift, but she had her own plans for the money: "You still have several short stories that haven't been included in a collection. We should publish another book. Let's use this money to publish the book, okay? I think that's enough."

	After sending the rubles and manuscript to the publishing house, it took only two and a half months for the short story collection "On the Volga River" to be published. Belov and his wife took all the printed books back home and then set up a book stall on Arbat Street.

	According to reports, such "self-produced, self-sold" authors in the Soviet Union are still few in number but are gradually increasing. This practice has been approved by the Soviet State Publishing Commission. Some restrictions related to self-published books have been lifted. Previously, it was not allowed to publish sheet music, albums, various pamphlets, posters, and postcards, but now all of these are allowed. Self-published authors can also sign contracts with the All-Union International Book Company to sell their works abroad.

	Most readers believe that the emergence of "self-produced, self-sold" writers is a new phenomenon in the reform era. If their works are indeed excellent, they will surely be welcomed by readers. Who knows, perhaps one day among them, a great writer will emerge!

	—Madam, this is a good book that I wrote and published myself. Would you like to buy one?
	—Young man, this is vodka that I brewed myself. Would you like a bottle?

    “文学个体户”
    许宏治　文　朱根华　画
    不知从什么时候起，莫斯科著名的步行街阿尔巴特街上开始出现了一些特殊的“商贩”：他们在这里设摊推销自己的“产品”——自己创作并自费印刷出版的小说和诗歌。康斯坦丁·米哈伊洛维奇·别洛夫就是这样一位“自产自销的文学个体户”。
    只要天气好，他准保带着一箱自己的短篇小说集，到这里来摆摊出售。打开封面，书名页上印着“作者自费出版”的字样，并印有出版年份和地点：1988年，莫斯科，文艺出版社。不时有好奇的行人在他的书摊旁停下脚步，向他提出各种问题：“有写斯大林的吗？”“有写改革的吗？”他总是回答说，他不是作协会员，不写那种书，他写的是反映普通人生活的小说。
    别洛夫是一位数学家，但自幼酷爱文学，人到中年后才写起小说来。写完一部长篇小说后他才发现，把书写完事情只完成了一半，出版的难度不亚于写作。于是，他开始了争取出版的“苦难的历程”。由于他的长篇有那么一点儿讽刺色彩，为了争取出版社接受，他又加了几篇调子乐观的短篇，汇成一集。
    出版社把他的书稿一压就是7年。别洛夫几近绝望，决心从此不再舞文弄墨。
    但是别洛夫的妻子奥莉加却不甘心。她为争取丈夫的书能出版而四处奔走，终获成功。去年春天，别洛夫的第一部小说集由苏联作家出版社出版。别洛夫很感激自己的贤内助，决定把全部稿酬赠给她。
    奥莉加接受了馈赠，但对这笔钱的用途却有她的打算：“你还有好些短篇小说没有收入集子呢。应该再出一本。咱们自己出钱来出这本书，好吗？就用这笔稿费，我看够了。”
    把卢布和书稿一起送到出版社后，只过了两个多月，短篇小说集《在伏尔加河上》就出版了。别洛夫夫妇把印好的书全部拉回家，后来便在阿尔巴特街摆起了书摊。
    据报道，这样的“自产自销”作者在苏联虽然人数还不多，但却在逐渐增加。这种做法已得到苏联国家出版委员会的准许。与作者自费出书有关的一些限制已取消。过去不允许出版的乐谱、画册、各种小册子，招贴画及明信片现在都允许出版。自费出书的作者还可同全苏国际书籍联合公司签订在国外销售其作品的合同。
    大多数读者认为，“自产自销”作家的出现是改革中的新事。他们的作品如果确系佳作，自会受到读者欢迎。说不定在他们当中，有朝一日也会出现蜚声文坛的大作家哩！
