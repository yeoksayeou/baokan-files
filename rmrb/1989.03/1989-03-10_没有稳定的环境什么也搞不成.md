In recent days, a few separatist elements in Lhasa have created disturbances, smashing government offices, looting stores, destroying vehicles, and assaulting pedestrians. They have shamelessly advocated for "Tibetan independence." Some officials and workers have been unable to go to work, and some primary schools have been forced to suspend classes. Normal production, work, and social orders have been seriously disrupted and damaged. People of all ethnic groups across the country are outraged by the atrocities of these separatist elements and firmly support the State Council's order to impose martial law in Lhasa.

Separatism is unpopular, and disturbances only make enemies happy. The Lhasa disturbances occurred within a specific context, but they reflect how precious a stable environment is for the Four Modernizations and how important it is for the people to live and work in peace.

Currently, we are striving to implement the policy of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms. To achieve this policy, many conditions are needed, and the most fundamental one is to maintain a stable social and political environment. Without a stable environment, nothing can be achieved.

In 1988, while China's economy continued to develop, it also experienced significant fluctuations, mainly due to rapid price increases and obvious inflation. This fluctuation is the result of years of accumulated contradictions between social total demand and social total supply. It has objectively fueled or triggered some factors that are not conducive to social stability. The guiding policy of rectification, rectification, and deepening reforms adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee is a policy to enter a new period of adjustment, a policy of stability, and a policy to continue to advance the cause of reform and construction in a stable environment.

In any country and any society, there are always two kinds of forces and factors: stability and instability. If the forces and factors of stability far outweigh those of instability, the country and society are in a state of stability; if the forces and factors of instability outweigh those of stability, the country and society will fall into turmoil and even chaos. What is the most important factor in maintaining the stability of a country and society? It is the ruling party and government representing the interests of the people and formulating and implementing a set of correct lines, policies, and principles.

Our party and government represent the interests of all ethnic groups in the country. Over the past decade, the lines formulated and implemented by the party and government, that is, the general policy of taking economic construction as the center, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and adhering to reform and opening up, have been proven correct through practice and are sincerely supported by the overwhelming majority of the people. Therefore, in our country and society, the factors and forces of stability are absolutely dominant. Emphasizing stability and resolutely safeguarding the political situation of unity and stability is popular; destroying stability and destroying the political situation of unity and stability is unpopular. At the same time, it should be noted that regardless of the situation, unstable factors and forces always exist, and we must pay attention to eliminating, resisting, and overcoming them at all times and not be complacent. If not handled properly, local and temporary unstable factors and forces will also have adverse effects on the overall situation. The disturbances in Lhasa once again remind us to pay attention to this.

Emphasizing stability is not to pursue some "super-stable structure," nor is it to stop the reforms that have been carried out for many years and have achieved remarkable results, nor is it to stop the political system reforms that have just begun, let alone to return to the product economy model. Stability and stagnation are two completely different things, just as reform is different from turmoil. Emphasizing stability is precisely to create a favorable environment to complete the tasks of rectification, rectification, and deepening reforms, and to achieve the overall vision of economic system reform and political system reform proposed by the Thirteenth Party Congress.

Some people are concerned that emphasizing stability will hinder democracy. This concern is unnecessary. Building socialist democratic politics is our established goal and the common pursuit of all enlightened people within and outside the party. However, to achieve this goal, we can only proceed step by step under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party, according to the goals, tasks, and steps proposed by the Thirteenth Party Congress, and we cannot rush. "Haste makes waste." We have suffered deeply from the economic and political "acute diseases," and these profound lessons should not be forgotten. Hurrying and seeking quick results in the matter of democracy will only add instability to society. Building socialist democratic politics must start from China's actual situation and cannot and does not need to copy the Western model. Some people are interested in formal democracy, but this does not help solve problems or advance the construction of socialist democracy. Adhering to the four cardinal principles and maintaining social stability will enable the construction of socialist democratic politics to develop solidly and healthily.

Emphasizing stability is not to say that we should not fight against bureaucratism and various corrupt practices within our party and government organs. It should be pointed out that these phenomena are precisely serious factors that affect and even undermine stability. The broad masses of the people detest the corrupt practices of a few party and government officials seeking personal gain through power, and the majority of comrades within the party and government organs who have a sense of justice are also indignant about the illegal and disciplinary actions of a few people. However, the fight against corruption is still not effective. Stability is not about tolerating or shielding corruption. Tolerating and shielding corruption is precisely undermining stability from the root. We must strengthen the construction of clean government, strictly enforce party discipline, government discipline, and legal discipline, and continuously and mercilessly expel those corrupt elements from the party and government organs. Only by actively and resolutely fighting against corruption can social stability be truly guaranteed.

This year is the first year of implementing the policy of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and the work done this year will have an important impact on achieving the goal of the end of the century. The task facing the entire party and people of all ethnic groups in the country is very arduous. Let us, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Party, work together, unite as one, and firmly safeguard the political situation of unity and stability, and strive together for the great goal of revitalizing China.

　　没有稳定的环境什么也搞不成
    本报评论员
    最近几天，少数分裂主义分子在拉萨市制造骚乱，砸机关，抢商店，毁汽车，打行人，肆无忌惮地鼓吹“西藏独立”。一些干部和职工无法上班，一些小学被迫停课，正常的生产秩序、工作秩序、社会秩序受到严重干扰和破坏。全国各族人民愤怒谴责少数分裂主义分子的暴行，坚决拥护国务院关于在拉萨市实行戒严的命令。
    分裂不得人心，骚乱只会使仇者快。拉萨骚乱的发生有其特定的背景，但是它反映出一个稳定的环境对于四化建设是多么可贵，对于人民安居乐业是多么重要。
    当前，我们正在努力贯彻治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的方针，要实现这个方针，需要很多条件，其中最基本的一条，就是要保持社会政治环境的稳定。没有稳定的环境，什么也搞不成。
    １９８８年，我国的经济在继续发展的同时，出现了较大的波动，主要是物价上涨过猛、明显通货膨胀。这种波动是过去多年社会总需求超过社会总供给的矛盾累积的结果，它在客观上也助长或激发了某些不利于社会稳定的因素。党的十三届三中全会所确定治理、整顿、深化改革的指导方针，是使我国进入一个新的调整期的方针，也是稳定的方针，是使我国在稳定的环境中把改革和建设事业继续推向前进的方针。
    任何国家、任何社会中都存在着稳定和不稳定的两种力量、两种因素。稳定的力量和因素大大超过不稳定的力量和因素，国家、社会就处于稳定的状态；不稳定的力量和因素超过了稳定的力量和因素，国家、社会就会陷入动荡以至动乱。使国家、社会稳定的最重要的因素是什么？那就是执政党及政府代表人民群众的利益，并且制定和执行一套正确的路线、方针、政策。
    我们的党和政府是代表全国各族人民利益的，１０年多来党和政府所制定和执行的路线，即以经济建设为中心、坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放的总方针，经过实践检验证明是正确的，得到全国绝大多数人的衷心拥护。因此，在我们国家和我们社会中稳定的因素、稳定的力量占绝对优势。强调稳定，坚决维护安定团结的政治局面，大得人心；破坏稳定，破坏安定团结的政治局面，不得人心。同时，也应当看到，不管在什么情况下，不稳定的因素和力量总是存在，要随时注意消除、抵制、克服，不可掉以轻心。如果搞不好，局部的、暂时的不稳定因素和力量也会对大局产生不利的影响。拉萨发生的骚乱再次提醒我们必须注意这一点。
    强调稳定，绝不是要搞什么“超稳定结构”，绝不是要把业已进行多年并取得显著成就的改革停顿下来，绝不是要把开始进行的政治体制改革停顿下来，更不是要重新回到产品经济模式中去。稳定和停滞完全是两码事，正如改革迥异于折腾一样。强调稳定，正是为了创造有利的环境，完成好治理、整顿、深化改革的任务，进而实现党的十三大所提出的经济体制改革和政治体制改革的全部构想。
    有人担心，强调稳定会妨碍民主。这种担心是不必要的。建设社会主义民主政治是我们的既定目标，是党内外一切有识之士的共同追求，但是要实现这个目标，只能在党中央的领导下，按照党的十三大提出的目标、任务、步骤，一步一步地进行，不能操之过急。“欲速则不达”。我们曾饱尝经济急性病之苦，也曾饱尝政治急性病之苦，这些深刻的教训不应该淡忘。在民主的问题上匆匆忙忙，急于求成，只会为社会增加不稳定的因素。建设社会主义民主政治，必须从中国的实际情况出发，不能也没有必要照搬西方那一套。有的人对形式上的民主很感兴趣，其实这无助于问题的解决，无补于社会主义民主建设的进展。坚持四项基本原则，保持社会的稳定，才能使社会主义民主政治的建设扎实、健康地发展。
    强调稳定，更不是不要同我们党政机关内部的官僚主义和各种腐败现象作斗争。应当指出，这些现象恰恰是影响稳定以至破坏稳定的严重因素。广大人民群众对少数党政干部以权谋私的腐败现象深恶痛绝，党政机关内部大多数富有正义感的同志对少数人违法违纪的行径也早已义愤填膺，而现在对腐败现象的斗争还很不得力。稳定绝不是容忍腐败、包庇腐败。容忍腐败、包庇腐败恰恰是从根本上破坏稳定。我们必须加强廉政建设，严肃党纪政纪法纪，不断地毫不留情地把那些腐败分子从党政机关清除出去。只有主动地坚决地进行反腐败的斗争，社会稳定才有切实的保障。
    今年是贯彻十三届三中全会方针的第一年，这一年的工作做得如何，对于实现本世纪末的奋斗目标将有重要影响。摆在全党和全国各族人民面前的任务十分艰巨。让我们在党中央领导下，和衷共济，同心同德，坚定地维护安定团结的政治局面，为实现振兴中华的伟大目标共同奋斗。
