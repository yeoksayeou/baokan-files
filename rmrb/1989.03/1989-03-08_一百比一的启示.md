The second National Youth Winter Games ice hockey final concluded on the 7th after ten intense and fierce matches. Compared to other events, the five teams' hundred athletes competed for just one gold medal, making the struggle seem particularly arduous. In contrast, some athletes can win multiple gold medals in individual events.

This 100-to-1 disparity often becomes an obstacle for some regions in developing ice hockey. It is estimated that maintaining an ice hockey team, including training, competition, and equipment costs, requires tens of thousands of yuan and a significant amount of foreign exchange. Despite this, winning an ice hockey gold medal remains challenging. Therefore, some places have had to dissolve their ice hockey teams.

However, on the other hand, ice hockey is increasingly loved and supported by the masses. Ice hockey matches are intense and thrilling, captivating the hearts of spectators. Each team has its own large group of fans. During the recent matches, fans and the general audience continuously cheered for their favorite teams, inspired by the players' brave and tenacious fighting spirit.

Over the years, mass ice hockey in our country has been increasingly popular. In the northeastern region, many large cities have built numerous ice rinks and skating rinks. Harbin alone has over a hundred ice rinks. The business community in our country is also increasingly focusing on the ice hockey world, beginning to sponsor some ice hockey teams. Among the eight ice hockey first-division teams in our country, the Changchun Machinery Factory team, Harbin Xingguang team, Jilin Jiangji team, and Qiqihar Ice Blade Factory team have received support from enterprises. Recent signs indicate that some places in southern China are planning to advance into the ice sports that have long been dominated by the north. The "Shanghai Ice Palace" is under construction, and Shenzhen is also planning its own indoor skating rink.

A single gold medal is limited, but it cannot stop the development of mass ice hockey. The love of the masses and societal support will surely bring a healthy new era to ice hockey in our country.

　　一百比一的启示
    第二届全国青少年运动会（冬季）冰球决赛，经过十场紧张激烈的争夺于七日结束。与其它项目相比，五个队的百名运动员仅为争夺一枚金牌而战，是显得太艰苦了。而有的选手却可以在个人项目中一人获数枚金牌。
    这种一百比一的反差，常常成为一些地方发展冰球运动的障碍。据测算，维持一个冰球队，包括训练和比赛的费用以及装备费要花掉数万元和不少外汇。尽管如此，争夺一枚冰球金牌仍然困难重重。因此，有些地方只好解散冰球队。
    但是，另一方面，冰球运动却日益受到群众的喜爱和支持，冰球比赛紧张激烈，扣人心弦，每支球队都拥有自己众多的球迷。在连日来的比赛中，球迷们和广大观众不断为自己喜爱的球队呐喊加油，为球员们勇猛顽强的拚搏精神所振奋。
    多年来，我国群众性冰球运动开展日益广泛，东北地区的各大城市建起了许多滑冰馆和冰场，仅哈尔滨市就有一百多个冰场。我国企业界也日益把目光投向冰球界，开始对一些冰球队进行资助。在我国八个冰球甲级队中，就有长春机械厂队、哈尔滨星光队、吉林市江机队和齐齐哈尔冰刃厂队得到企业的支持。最近一些迹象表明，我国南方的一些地方也正在筹划向一直被北方垄断的冰上运动进军。“上海冰宫”正在筹建，深圳也正筹建自己的室内滑冰馆。
    一枚金牌是有限的，但挡不住群众性冰球运动的开展。群众的喜爱和社会的支持，必将使我国冰球运动迎来一个健康发展的新时期。
