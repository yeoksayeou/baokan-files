    A once-famous and innocent child star has fallen into alcoholism and drug addiction, becoming a troubled youth. Who is to blame for this?

    It is undeniable that Dru has her weaknesses; she is proud, willful, and lacks self-control. However, these are typical flaws that a child usually has and can gradually overcome with increasing experience. Nevertheless, Dru lives in a society filled with drugs, casinos, and nightclubs, and in a broken family that lacks familial warmth. After gaining fame, she received excessive, blind admiration and flattery, which exacerbated her weaknesses. The lack of genuine care and affection has left her spiritual life extremely impoverished.

    Dru's repentance is a relief, and from her confession, people can draw some lessons.

　　谁之过
    一个名噪一时、天真可爱的童星，竟沦为酗酒、吸毒的坏孩子，这究竟是谁之过？
    不可否认，小德鲁自身有弱点，她骄傲、任性、缺乏自制力。不过，一个孩子通常会有的这类弱点是可以随着阅历的增加而逐步克服的。然而，小德鲁生活在一个充斥着毒品、赌场、夜总会的社会环境中，生活在一个破碎的、缺少天伦之乐的家庭里。成名之后，过份的盲目的宠爱与吹捧助长了她的弱点；而缺少真诚的关怀和温情，又使她的精神生活极度贫乏。
    小德鲁的悔过令人高兴，从她的自述中，人们也可以悟出一些道理。
