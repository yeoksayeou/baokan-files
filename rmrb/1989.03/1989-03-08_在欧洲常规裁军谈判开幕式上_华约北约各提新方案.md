At the opening ceremony of the European Conventional Arms Negotiations, both the Warsaw Pact and NATO presented new proposals.

The Warsaw Pact proposed a three-phase reduction of conventional arms. In the first phase, both sides would reduce their conventional arms by 10% to 15% within two to three years. In the second phase, each side would further reduce their forces by 500,000 personnel within the same timeframe. In the third phase, both sides' conventional arms would be reduced to a purely defensive level.

NATO proposed the following four points: First, establish a maximum limit for conventional arms, with each side holding half of the total. Second, limit each country's possession of conventional weapons to no more than 30% of the total in Europe. Third, set a maximum limit for arms outside each country's territory. Fourth, restrict the number of troops stationed in foreign countries to prevent excessive concentration of forces.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 6 - Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze proposed a new idea for reducing the conventional forces of the two major military blocs in Europe, the Warsaw Pact and NATO, at the opening ceremony of the European Conventional Arms Negotiations and the negotiations on building trust and security measures in Europe held here on the morning of the 6th.

Shevardnadze pointed out that the idea of reducing European conventional arms in three phases aims to reduce both sides' arms to a "defensive level."

In the first phase, NATO and the Warsaw Pact would each reduce their conventional forces by 10% to 15% within two to three years. In the second phase, each side would further reduce their forces by 25% (approximately 500,000 personnel) within two to three years. In the third phase, both sides' conventional armed forces would be reduced to a purely defensive level after the reductions.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 6 - British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe announced on behalf of NATO at the opening ceremony of the European Conventional Arms Negotiations and the negotiations on building trust and security measures in Europe today that the West has a four-point plan for reducing conventional arms in Europe.

This plan proposes: First, set a maximum limit for the number of tanks, artillery, and armored vehicles that the Warsaw Pact and NATO each possess, i.e., set the maximum limit for tanks in Europe at 40,000, artillery at 33,000, and armored vehicles at 56,000. NATO and the Warsaw Pact would each hold half of these totals. Second, each country's possession of these weapons should not exceed 30% of the total, i.e., tanks should not exceed 12,000, artillery should not exceed 10,000, and armored vehicles should not exceed 16,800. This would require the Soviet Union to reduce its current tanks and artillery in Europe by two-thirds and its armored vehicles by more than half. Third, set a maximum limit for arms outside each country's territory, i.e., 3,200 tanks, 1,700 artillery pieces, and 6,000 armored vehicles. Fourth, limit the number of troops stationed in foreign countries and prevent the excessive concentration of armed forces in certain regions.

March 6, the opening ceremony of the European Conventional Arms Negotiations was held at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock addressed the opening ceremony, and 35 countries' foreign ministers attended. (Xinhua News Agency, fax photo)

　　在欧洲常规裁军谈判开幕式上
    华约北约各提新方案
    华约：分三阶段裁减常规军备。一、两三年内双方各裁减常规军备的１０％—１５％；二、同样在两三年内各自减军５０万人；三、使双方常规军备仅具防御性质
    北约：一、确定常规军备最高限额，双方分别拥有一半；二、每国拥有常规武器不超过欧洲总数的３０％；三、确定每个国家领土以外军备的最高限额；四、限制驻他国军队人数，防止力量过分集中
    据新华社维也纳３月６日电　苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽６日上午在这里举行的欧洲常规军备谈判和欧洲建立信任和安全措施谈判的开幕式上提出分三阶段裁减欧洲华约和北约两大军事集团常规力量的新设想。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽指出，分三阶段裁减欧洲常规军备的设想旨在把双方的军备减少到“防御的水平”。
    第一阶段，北约和华约在两至三年内各自裁减１０％至１５％的常规力量；第二阶段，同样在二、三年之内各自再裁减２５％的兵力（约５０万人）；在第三阶段，双方的常规武装力量经裁减后将仅仅具有防御性质。
    据新华社维也纳３月６日电　英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪今天在欧洲常规军备谈判和欧洲建立信任和安全措施谈判的开幕式上代表北约宣布了西方关于裁减欧洲常规军备的四点方案。
    此项方案建议：一、确定华约和北约双方拥有坦克、火炮和装甲车的最高限额，即规定欧洲地区坦克的最高限额为４万辆，火炮３３０００门，装甲车５６０００辆。北约和华约分别拥有上述总数的一半；二、每一个国家拥有的上述武器每种不得超过总数的３０％，即坦克不得超过１２０００辆，火炮不得超过１万门，装甲车不得超过１６８００辆。这样，苏联就必须将其目前驻欧洲的坦克和火炮减少２／３，装甲车减少一半以上；三、确定每个国家领土以外的军备的最高限额为坦克３２００辆，火炮１７００门，装甲车６０００辆；四、限制驻扎在外国的军队人数并防止武装力量在某地区过分集中。
