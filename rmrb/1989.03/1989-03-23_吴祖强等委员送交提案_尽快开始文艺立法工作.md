A proposal titled "Suggesting the Immediate Start of Art Legislation Work" has been submitted to the Political Consultative Conference by the participants in the conference, including the Executive Chairman of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, Cao Yu, and Vice Chairmen Wu Zuqiang, Xie Jin, Feng Jicai, Zhang Junqiu, and Zhou Weizhi, who previously served as a cultural official.

In accordance with the recently issued "Several Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Promoting the Prosperity of Literature and Art," this proposal raises two issues of utmost concern to artists: the protection of individual creative freedom and the protection of the rights that artists themselves should enjoy.

Wu Zuqiang told the reporter that the 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee have been the best period for the arts in the history of the People's Republic. However, due to the long-term abnormal state and various interferences in the arts community, many artists still have various forms of mental and emotional constraints and lingering fears, which hinder the full development of their artistic creativity and potential. Therefore, during the last year's Congress of Literature and Art, many representatives, while discussing the soon-to-be-issued "Several Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Promoting the Prosperity of Literature and Art," felt both excited and inspired, but also worried about whether the document could be truly implemented. They suggested that corresponding regulations with legal force should be made to ensure the implementation of the document's spirit.

He said that as representatives of the arts community, we request that relevant government departments seriously consider and promptly organize efforts to draft a comprehensive art law that can properly handle major issues in the arts community.

Wu Zuqiang believes that with art legislation in line with constitutional principles, it is possible to eliminate obstacles and conflicts that hinder the normal development of the arts through legal means, and to guide the entire arts industry. The various negative phenomena and art disputes that have begun to spread in the arts community can also be rectified and resolved through regulations.

　　吴祖强等委员送交提案        
    尽快开始文艺立法工作
    本报北京３月２２日讯  记者向兵报道：一份《建议尽速开始文艺立法工作》的提案，日前已由参加政协会议的全国文联执行主席曹禺，副主席吴祖强、谢晋、冯骥才、张君秋和担任过文化部负责人的周巍峙等６人，联名提交政协提案组。
    遵循刚下发的《中共中央关于进一步繁荣文艺的若干意见》精神，这个提案提出了文艺家最为关心的两个问题，一是对个人创作自由的保护，二是对文艺家自己应享有的权益的保护。
    吴祖强告诉记者，十一届三中全会以来的１０年，是建国以来文艺界的最佳时期。但由于文艺界曾长期处于不正常的状态和种种干扰下，许多文艺家思想和感情上有形、无形的束缚以及尚存的“余悸”心理，仍阻碍他们艺术创造力和潜能发挥。因此，在去年文代会上，不少代表在讨论即将下发的《中共中央关于进一步繁荣文艺的若干意见》时，既感到兴奋和鼓舞，又担心文件能否真正贯彻执行，提出应制定起法律作用的相应规定，用具体法规来保证文件精神的落实。
    他说，作为文艺界的议政代表，我们提请政府有关部门郑重考虑，尽快组织力量着手制订能妥善处理文艺界重大问题的、尽可能完备的文艺法。
    吴祖强认为，有了符合宪法原则的文艺立法，既可以通过法律手段消除有碍文艺正常发展的困扰和矛盾，也能对整个文艺工作起到引导作用。目前文艺界已开始泛滥的种种不良现象和文艺纠纷，也能用法规进行整治和解决。
