It is joyous to hear that Gao Zhiping has been appointed as the director of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe. The troupe advertised for a director, and six people applied. After 13 judges voted, Gao Zhiping was honored with the position. In the news article published in the People's Daily on March 2, there was a sentence that caught the eye: "Gao Zhiping is the only non-Communist Party member among the six applicants."

A non-Party member becoming a director, and doing so after competing with five Party members, is indeed news. In the past, although there have been some non-Party members in leadership positions, they were still quite few. Some units even had all positions with the title of "director" filled by Party members. As the vanguard of the working class, Party members should have a higher level of political awareness and political standing, and the selection of cadres should emphasize political qualifications. Having more Party members in leadership positions is also normal. As for Party positions such as secretaries and committee members, they naturally must be filled by Party members. However, neither the Party Constitution nor the Constitution stipulates that "directors" must be Party members. Joining the Party is not for the sake of becoming a "director." Meeting the qualifications of a Party member does not necessarily mean meeting the qualifications of a "director." There are many talented and capable non-Party members who can certainly become "directors." Whoever meets the qualifications should take on the role.

Gao Zhiping's appointment as director also tells us that the selection of cadres should promote open competition, giving everyone the opportunity to compete and allowing talents to stand out. In this way, those who are promoted are truly deserving, and those who are not promoted are also convinced. Like Gao Zhiping's appointment as director, there was no pulling of strings or opening of backdoors. It was all about "dueling on the stage" and "strategizing in the hall," making the appointment of the director beyond reproach. The public has strong opinions about the non-transparent and unfair selection processes, where sometimes only a few leaders decide. There is a saying: "If they say you're good, you're good; if they say you're not, you're not, even if you are." There is also the saying: "You can't help but agree." The Oriental Song and Dance Troupe's method of determining "good" or "not good" is through open competition, and even non-Party members can compete with Party members. The selection criteria are equal for everyone. This opens the door to serving the country and avoids the problem of first-rate talents being overshadowed by second-rate ones.

Perhaps some comrades are worried: If a non-Party member becomes the director, will the troupe still need the Party's leadership? There is no need to worry. The director not being a Party member does not mean there is no Party leadership in the troupe. The Party organization in the troupe is responsible for propagating and implementing the Party's line, principles, and policies, and for educating and managing Party members to fully play their vanguard and exemplary roles. It is not about the Party deciding which song to sing or who should sing it, or which dance to perform or who should perform it. There are also administrative tasks such as business guidance, management, and logistics services, which are the responsibilities of the director or other administrative leaders. The Party does not need to manage so much, nor can it manage so much. The Party's main task is to manage the Party. Party members can certainly become directors and should strive to do so. Whether the director is a Party member or not, the troupe will inevitably have Party leadership.

The Oriental Song and Dance Troupe's recruitment of a director is just one way of selecting cadres. Different units should decide on a method based on their own situation and do not necessarily have to recruit. The methods can vary, but one principle has universal significance: encouraging open and equal competition, allowing more Gao Zhiping-like figures from both inside and outside the Party to take the stage.

### 欣闻高志平当团长

　　欣闻高志平当团长
    东方歌舞团招聘团长，有６人投标，经过１３名评委投票决定，高志平荣任团长。３月２日人民日报发表的新闻中有一句引人注目的话：“高志平是６位投标人中唯一的非共产党员。”
    非党员当团长，而且是与５位党员竞争之后当上的团长，这是新闻。在过去相当长的时期内，党外人士当“长”的，虽然也有一些，但毕竟很少。有些单位甚至凡带“长”字的，都由党员担任，党员作为工人阶级先锋队中的一员，政治觉悟和政治水平应该高一些，选拔干部要重视政治条件，党员中的“长”多一些，这也正常。至于党内的书记、委员，自然只能在党内产生。但是，无论党章还是宪法，都没有规定“长”必须是党员。入党不是为了当“长”，够党员的条件不一定够“长”的条件。党外拥有大量德才兼备的干部，完全可以当“长”，谁够条件谁来干。
    高志平当团长这件事还告诉我们，选拔干部要提倡公开竞争，使人人都有竞争的资格，使人才都有脱颖而出的机会。这样，上去的当之无愧，上不去的也心悦诚服。像高志平当团长，一不拉“关系”，二不开“后门”，凭的是“擂台比武”、“金殿对策”，当团长叫人无话可说。群众对那种不透明、不公道甚至只由个别领导同志说了算的选拔，意见很大，有人批评这种现象是：“说你行，你就行，不行也行；说你不行，你就不行，行也不行”，还有一句话是：“不服不行”。东方歌舞团决定“行”与“不行”的办法是公开竞争，而且还有非党员与党员竞争，选拔标准面前人人平等。这敞开了报国之门，避免了一流人物屈居二流人物之下的弊端。
    也许有同志担心：由非党同志当团长，歌舞团还要不要党的领导？这不必担心。团长不是党员，不等于团里没有党的领导，歌舞团的党组织担负着宣传和执行党的路线、方针、政策，对党员进行教育和管理，使他们充分发挥先锋和模范作用的任务，并不是由党去管这支歌怎样唱由谁唱、那组舞怎样跳由谁跳，还有诸如业务指导、经营管理、后勤服务等工作，那是团长或其他行政领导的事，党不必管那么多，也管不了、管不好那么多，党的主要任务是管党。党员当然可以当团长，而且更应该努力争取当团长，不管团长是党员或不是党员，歌舞团都不可能没有党的领导。
    东方歌舞团招聘团长，只是选拔干部的一个途径，不同的单位只能根据自己的情况去决定采取某一种途径，并不一定都要招聘。途径可以有所不同，但有一条原则具有普遍意义，就是鼓励公开竞争，平等竞争，使党内党外更多高志平式的人物上台。
