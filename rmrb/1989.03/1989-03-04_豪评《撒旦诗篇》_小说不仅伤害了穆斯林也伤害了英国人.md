Xinhua News Agency, London, March 2nd.

The British Foreign Secretary, Geoffrey Howe, said today in an interview with a radio journalist that Salman Rushdie's novel *The Satanic Verses* has not only hurt Muslims but also offended British people. However, Britain will not allow freedom of speech to be compromised.

Howe stated, “This book is also very biting and vulgar towards us. It compares Britain to Hitler's Germany. We are very displeased with this, to a degree no less than that of Muslims who are offended by the parts of the book that attack their faith.”

　　豪评《撒旦诗篇》
    小说不仅伤害了穆斯林也伤害了英国人
    据新华社伦敦３月２日电  英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪今天在接受广播电台记者采访时说，拉什迪的小说《撒旦诗篇》不仅伤害了穆斯林，也伤害了英国人，但英国决不允许没有言论自由。
    豪说，“这本书对我们也很尖刻，很粗俗，它把英国比作希特勒德国。我们对此很反感，其程度不亚于信仰穆斯林的人们对书中攻击其信仰部分的厌恶。”
