Hainan emphasizes transparent governance and strives for clean government. Liang Xiang says that if corrupt practices are not stopped, they will affect the construction of the special economic zone.

Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, March 2 (Reporter Ren Xiaodong) Hainan Province Governor Liang Xiang today proposed at a meeting in Haikou that Hainan will vigorously combat corruption and build a clean government in the special economic zone.

Liang Xiang severely criticized some officials in Hainan who, taking advantage of their positions and work conveniences, illegally resell scarce commodities, speculate on land, extort and accept bribes, embezzle and steal, arbitrarily issue bonuses, and squander public funds. Among these, land speculation and bribery are the most serious.

Liang Xiang said that foreign investors have reflected that in some departments in Hainan, things cannot be done without money, gifts, or invitations, and some even openly demand bribes.

He believes that if these bad practices are not stopped, they may affect the overall construction of the Hainan Special Economic Zone.

It is understood that relevant departments in Hainan conducted a serious investigation and punishment of some illegal and disciplinary violations within the Party last year, with 446 Party members receiving penalties, including 63 who were expelled from the Party.

Liang Xiang believes that an important measure for the clean government construction in the special economic zone is "transparent governance," which includes publicizing administrative procedures, publicizing administrative results, publicizing officials' incomes, and publicizing criticisms. At the same time, establishing a reporting center to place Party and government officials under effective supervision by the masses.

It is understood that to strengthen the clean government construction, the Hainan Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have decided to establish a joint meeting system for supervisory and law enforcement departments such as discipline inspection, supervision, prosecution, audit, industry and commerce, and customs.

Liang Xiang also put forward new requirements for the discipline inspection and supervision cadres in the special economic zone. He required them to be both resolute in opposing corrupt and ugly things and enthusiastic in supporting new things; they should not ignore corrupt practices that damage productivity, nor should they suppress things that are clearly beneficial to productivity development.

　　海南强调为政公开
    大力肃贪建设廉政
    梁湘说歪风不刹影响特区建设
    新华社海口３月２日电  （记者任小东）海南省长梁湘今天在此间召开的一次会议上提出，海南将大力反贪污受贿，建立一个廉洁的特区政府。
    梁湘今天在会上严厉批评海南一些干部，利用职权和工作便利，非法倒卖紧俏商品、炒卖土地、索贿受贿、贪污盗窃、滥发奖金、挥霍公款，其中尤以炒卖土地、受贿贪污最为严重。
    梁湘说，外商反映，到海南有些部门办事，不花钱、不送礼、不请客就办不成，有的甚至公开索贿。
    他认为，这种歪风不刹，就可能影响海南特区建设的大局。
    据了解，海南有关部门去年对党内一些违法乱纪现象进行了认真查处，有４４６名党员为此受到处分，其中开除党籍的有６３人。
    梁湘认为，特区廉政建设重要措施就是“为政公开”，公开办事制度、公开办事结果、公开干部收入、公开批评，同时建立举报中心，置党政机关干部于群众的有效监督之下。
    据了解，为加强政府的廉政建设，海南省委、省政府已决定建立纪检、监察、检察、审计、工商、海关等监督、执法部门的联席会议制度。
    梁湘还对特区的纪检、监察干部提出了新要求。要求他们既要对腐败丑恶的东西嫉恶如仇，又要对新生事物热情扶植；既不能对破坏生产力的腐败现象置若罔闻，又不能把明明是发展生产力的东西硬说成是不好的东西加以扼杀。
