Gold market experts predict the trend of gold prices for the year. The world's gold supply is expected to reach 1,855 tons. Gold prices are expected to fluctuate between $380 and $420 per ounce.

London gold market expert Lorna O'Connor predicts that the average gold price for the year 1989 could reach $410 per ounce.

On March 9th, O'Connor, from the London Metals Research Department of Hill Samuel & Co. Ltd., released her "Annual Review of the World Gold Industry" at a press conference. She believes that overall, gold prices will remain unstable this year. However, she is confident that "the 20% drop in gold prices in 1988 will not be repeated this year." She expects gold prices to fluctuate between $380 and $420 per ounce this year, with the highest price not exceeding $450 per ounce.

Some market experts here predict that gold prices may drop below $360 per ounce at some point this year. O'Connor says that the possibility of gold prices falling to the $360 per ounce level in the first half of this year is very small.

According to O'Connor's estimates, the world's gold supply in 1989 will be 1,855 tons, an increase of 271 tons from the previous year; the world's gold demand will be 1,447 tons, of which 1,050 tons will be for jewelry, with a total demand increase of 74 tons compared to 1988. Adding the net increase of 50 tons of gold supply due to gold loans, the world's gold supply will exceed demand by 458 tons this year, an increase of 49 tons over the previous year's surplus.

　　黄金市场专家预测今年金价走势
    世界黄金供给量将达到１８５５吨
    金价将浮动于３８０—４２０美元／盎司
    新华社伦敦３月９日电  （记者李宗扬）伦敦黄金市场专家朗娜·奥康奈尔预测，１９８９年全年黄金平均价格可望达到每盎司４１０美元。
    希尔森·莱曼·赫顿证券公司伦敦金属研究部的奥康奈尔９日在记者招待会上公布了她的《世界黄金业年度回顾》。她认为，总的说，今年金价仍不稳定。但她深信，“金价在１９８８年下降２０％的情况今年将不会重复。”今年内，金价大约在每盎司３８０美元至４２０美元之间波动，最高不会超过４５０美元。
    此间有的市场专家则预测说，金价在今年某个时候可能会跌到每盎司３６０美元之下。奥康奈尔说，金价今年上半年跌到每盎司３６０美元水平的可能性很小。
    据奥康奈尔估算，１９８９年世界黄金供给量将为１８５５吨，比上一年增加２７１吨；世界黄金需求量为１４４７吨，其中１０５０吨为首饰业需求，总需求比１９８８年增加７４吨。加上因黄金贷款净增加的５０吨供给量，全年世界黄金供大于求４５８吨，比上一年过剩量增加４９吨。
