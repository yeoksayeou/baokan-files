The exposure by this newspaper on March 25 (see page 2 of March 26 issue) of the issue of Wei Mingsheng, former secretary of the Ankang Administrative Office, who engaged in extensive farewells and feasting during his transfer, has drawn widespread attention. Recently, Zhang Boxing, secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee, met with reporters and made a statement. He said that the provincial committee and the provincial government have formed a working group, which will be dispatched to Ankang for an investigation. He stressed that the matter must be thoroughly investigated and will not be tolerated or covered up.

The reporter's investigation confirmed that during his approximately 100-day "farewell" and "departure" activities, Wei Mingsheng squandered various expenses (including gifts) amounting to more than 6,000 yuan, causing a negative impact on society. Upon receiving the reporter's report, Zhang Boxing immediately issued instructions, ordering the provincial disciplinary inspection commission and the supervision bureau to quickly organize a team for the investigation. After the issue is clarified, serious measures will be taken.

Zhang Boxing stated in his conversation that the provincial committee will, on the basis of summarizing this lesson, formulate some regulations regarding the discipline of cadre transfers and take some specific measures. This will gradually lead the construction of party style and clean government in the entire province towards regularization and institutionalization.

　　重视舆论监督　派员实地调查        
    陕西着手处理魏明生问题
    据新华社西安３月２７日电  （记者万武义）本社３月２５日（见本报３月２６日二版）披露了安康原行署专员魏明生在调离时四处告别，吃喝拿要的问题后，引起社会上的关注。日前，陕西省委书记张勃兴约见记者并发表谈话。他说，省委、省政府已经组成工作组，将迅速派往安康进行调查。他表示：一定要查个水落石出，决不姑息迁就。
    记者调查证实，魏明生在长达１００天左右的“告别”“辞行”活动中，挥霍各种费用（包括礼品）在６０００元以上，在社会上造成恶劣影响。在接到记者的反映材料时，省委书记张勃兴就作出批示，责成省纪检委和监察厅尽快组织力量调查，待问题查清后，作出严肃处理。
    张勃兴在谈话时表示，省委将在总结这个教训的基础上，制定有关干部调动纪律的若干规定和采取一些具体措施，把全省的党风建设、廉政建设逐步引向经常化和制度化。
