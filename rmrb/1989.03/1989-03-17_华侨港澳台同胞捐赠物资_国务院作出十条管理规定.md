The State Council recently issued several regulations on strengthening the management of donated goods by overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots.

The regulations state that overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots, with their patriotic fervor, have made significant contributions to the construction of their hometowns and the support of the Four Modernizations by donating money and goods. The state has always encouraged and supported their patriotic actions. To further improve the work of accepting donations, correctly guide the direction of accepting donations, and address some of the chaotic situations that exist in the work of accepting donations, in accordance with the spirit of the central government's decision to rectify the economic environment and rectify the economic order, and the State Council's decision to strictly control the import of high-end consumer goods, the following ten regulations are hereby issued.

1. For donations of goods by overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots to the mainland, the principle of voluntary donation and self-use by the recipient must be adhered to. Government agencies at all levels are not allowed to accept donations from overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots. Leaders at all levels must strictly comply with these regulations and are not allowed to issue notes to interfere with the approval and management work.

2. Encourage overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots to donate necessary production materials directly used in industrial and agricultural production, education, culture, health, science and technology, and public welfare. For materials used in the above areas, customs will exempt them from taxes in accordance with relevant state regulations.

3. Encourage the donation of foreign exchange. For foreign exchange donated by overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots to support the construction of their hometowns, after approval by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, it can be allocated through the State Foreign Exchange Adjustment Center.

4. For donations of automobiles, color televisions, refrigerators, video recorders, computers, and other restricted imported electromechanical products that are subject to state quota management, provincial, autonomous region, and municipal governments must strictly approve the acceptance of donations in accordance with state regulations. Excessive quotas will not be approved for import. Unauthorized approvals will result in the investigation of the responsibility of relevant leaders and handlers; the donated products will be dealt with strictly by the General Administration of Customs in conjunction with relevant departments in accordance with regulations.

5. For restricted imported electromechanical products that do not have donation quotas, the provincial, autonomous region, and municipal electromechanical equipment import examination offices will, in conjunction with the provincial (autonomous region, municipality) overseas Chinese affairs offices and Taiwan affairs offices, report to the State Council's electromechanical equipment import examination office for approval and file with the State Council's overseas Chinese affairs office and Taiwan affairs office.

6. For restricted imported electromechanical products, including those accepted through the "purchase abroad, take delivery domestically" method, only the direct recipient units are allowed to use them. The recipient units are not allowed to transfer, sell for profit, or swap, nor are they allowed to sell in the market after assembly and processing. All restricted imported electromechanical products accepted as donations must obtain import licenses from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade and its authorized agencies, and customs will release them upon presentation of the licenses.

7. For donations of materials subject to import license management and monopoly operations, except for those specified in items four and five, they will be reported to the relevant state departments for approval by the provincial (autonomous region, municipality) overseas Chinese affairs offices and Taiwan affairs offices, and customs will release them in accordance with regulations. Except for self-use, they will be operated by designated monopoly operation units or purchased by the materials and commercial departments at reasonable prices, and the purchasing units (including monopoly operation units) will pay taxes in accordance with regulations.

8. Donations made by foreign-invested enterprises and foreign representatives of enterprises engaged in foreign processing and assembly, compensation trade, and Chinese-funded institutions stationed abroad (including Hong Kong and Macao regions) in their foreign exchanges, as well as donations and various forms of aid from foreign governments or civilian economic and trade groups to relevant units in China, do not fall within the scope of donations by overseas Chinese and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots and should be handled in accordance with relevant state regulations.

9. For those who, under the guise of accepting donations, collude with foreign entities to engage in illegal activities such as currency speculation, certificate evasion, tax evasion, and resale, their illegal gains will be confiscated and they will be punished in accordance with the law.

10. These regulations shall come into effect on March 1, 1989.

　　华侨港澳台同胞捐赠物资　国务院作出十条管理规定
    新华社北京３月１５日电  国务院最近对加强华侨、港澳台同胞捐赠进口物资管理作出了若干规定。
    规定说，华侨和港澳台同胞满怀爱国爱乡的热情，捐款捐物，为建设侨乡，支援四化建设作出了贡献。国家对华侨、港澳台同胞的爱国行动，一贯予以鼓励和支持。为进一步做好接受捐赠工作，正确引导接受捐赠的方向，克服接受捐赠工作中存在的某些混乱现象，根据中央关于治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的精神和国务院关于严格控制高档消费品进口的决定，特作以下十条规定。
    一、对华侨和港澳台同胞向国内捐赠物资，坚持捐赠自愿、接受自用的原则。各级机关不得接受华侨、港澳台同胞的捐赠。各级领导要严格遵守本规定，不得批条子干预审批和管理工作。
    二、鼓励华侨和港澳台同胞捐赠必需的生产资料，直接用于工农业生产、文教卫生、科技以及公益事业等。对用于上述方面的物资，由海关按照国家有关规定，予以免税。
    三、鼓励捐赠现汇。对华侨、港澳台同胞为支援家乡建设个人捐赠的现汇，经国家外汇管理局批准后，可进入国家外汇调剂中心进行调剂。
    四、捐赠国家规定限额管理的汽车、彩色电视机、电冰箱、录像机、计算机等限制进口的机电产品，各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府要严格按照国家规定的捐赠限额审批接受捐赠。超过限额的，一律不得批准进口。越权审批的，要追究有关领导和经办者的责任；对所接受捐赠的产品，由海关总署会同有关部门按规定从严处理。
    五、未规定捐赠限额的国家限制进口的机电产品，由各省、自治区、直辖市机电设备进口审查办公室会同省（自治区、直辖市）侨办、台办核报国务院机电设备进口审查办公室审批，并报国务院侨办、台办备案。
    六、对国家限制进口的机电产品，包括以“在外售券，境内取货”方式接受的捐赠，只限直接接受单位自用。接受捐赠单位不得转让、转卖增值或串换，也不得经组装加工后在市场出售。所有接受捐赠的国家限制进口的机电产品，都应凭批准文件向对外经济贸易部及其授权机构申领进口许可证，海关凭许可证验放。
    七、捐赠属于实行进口许可证管理和专卖、专营的物资，除第四、第五条规定者外，由各省（自治区、直辖市）侨办、台办核报国家主管部门归口核批，由海关按规定验放。除自用者外，交指定专卖、专营单位经营，或由物资、商业部门按合理价格收购，并由收购单位（包括专卖、专营单位）照章补税。
    八、外商投资企业和开展对外加工装配、补偿贸易企业的外方代表，我派驻境外（包括港澳地区）的中资机构，在对外交往中外国官方或民间经贸团体、外商向我有关单位赠送物资以及各种无偿援助，不属于华侨、港澳台同胞捐赠范围，应按国家有关规定办理。
    九、对假借接受捐赠名义内外串通，进行套汇、逃证、逃税、倒卖等非法活动的，一律没收其所得，并依法惩处。
    十、本规定自１９８９年３月１日起执行。
