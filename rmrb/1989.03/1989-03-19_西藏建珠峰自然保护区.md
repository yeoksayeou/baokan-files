The Mount Everest Nature Reserve, the highest point on Earth, was officially established in Lhasa today. The reserve is located in the central part of the Himalayas in southwestern Tibet, covering an area of approximately 12,000 square kilometers across the counties of Dingri, Dingjie, and Nyalam in the Shigatse region, as well as the Zhangmu border crossing between China and Nepal.

This area boasts unique natural resources. From the evergreen broadleaf forests on the southern slopes of the Himalayas to the subalpine coniferous forests, alpine shrub meadows, alpine vegetation belts, and the high-altitude glaciers above 8,000 meters, it is the highest and most complete vertical ecological system in the world. It is home to many rare and precious species of flora and fauna.

This project has received support from the American Alpine Institute. Experts from the American side have described this region as one of the world's ten greatest natural wonders.

　　西藏建珠峰自然保护区
    本报拉萨３月１８日电  记者卢小飞报道：地球上海拔最高的珠峰自然保护区，今天在拉萨成立。珠峰自然保护区在西藏西南部的喜马拉雅山脉中部地带，范围涉及日喀则地区定日、定结、聂拉木３县和中、尼交界的樟木口岸，约１．２万多平方公里。
    这里的自然资源独一无二。从喜马拉雅南坡的常绿阔叶林带到亚高山针叶林带、高山灌丛草甸带、高山冰缘植被带，以及８０００米以上的高山冰雪带，是世界上垂直带最高、最完整的生态系统，生存着地球上珍贵而稀有的动植物品种。
    这项工作得到美国高山研究所的资助。美方专家称这一地带为世界十大奇观之一。
