People's Daily, Belgrade, March 27th.

At the joint session of the Kosovar Provincial Assembly held on the 23rd, the Constitution Amendment of the Republic of Serbia was passed with an overwhelming majority of votes in favor, 10 against, and 2 abstentions. Prior to this, the constitutional amendment had been approved by both the Serbian Republic Assembly and the Vojvodina Autonomous Province Assembly. The lengthy process of constitutional revision in the Republic of Serbia, which lasted three years, has now come to an end. The new constitution will be officially promulgated in Belgrade on March 28th.

People's Daily, Belgrade, March 27th.

The communiqué issued by the Presidency of the South Slavic Federation on the 24th stated that the passage of the Serbian Republic Constitution Amendment by the Kosovar Assembly has profound significance. It creates the premise for developing and strengthening the unity and solidarity of the Serbian Republic within the constitutional framework, thereby contributing to the political stability of the entire Yugoslav state. The Presidency warned that in recent days, Albanian residents of Uroševac and Albanian university students in Priština have engaged in violent behavior during demonstrations, rudely disrupting public order, social tranquility, and attacking security institutions. This is an attempt to directly confront the legal decisions of the Kosovar Assembly.

    本报贝尔格莱德电　记者严正报道：２４日发表的南联邦主席团会议公报指出，科索沃议会通过塞尔维亚共和国宪法修正案具有深远的意义。它在宪法范围内为发展和加强塞尔维亚共和国的统一和团结，从而为整个南斯拉夫国家的政治稳定创造了前提。主席团警告这几天乌罗舍瓦茨阿族人和普里什蒂纳阿族大学生在示威游行中采取暴力行为，粗鲁破坏公共秩序、社会安宁、攻击安全机构，这是试图直接对抗科索沃议会的合法决定。
