Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 18th.

Liu Fuzhi, the Prosecutor-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, recently accepted an interview with a reporter and emphasized that the procuratorial organs must carry out the struggle against corruption and bribery to the end.

Liu Fuzhi said, after the national procurators-general work conference held last November, in accordance with the policies of the Party Central Committee and relevant legal provisions, we have, in light of the actual situation, emphasized the need to focus on combating corruption and bribery crimes as the key work of the procuratorial organs, placing it at the forefront of the fight against economic crimes. Compared to the first half of the year, the number of major corruption cases filed in the second half of last year increased by 35%. Some local procuratorates have also concentrated their efforts to crack down on a number of difficult cases. In addition, the procuratorial organs, based on reports, have discovered a number of corruption and bribery cases involving some leading cadres and cases that occurred in central government agencies. From the current situation, the work of combating corruption and bribery crimes has played a relatively good role in boosting the confidence of the broad masses of the people and their enthusiasm for fighting against corruption and bribery crimes, in enhancing the legal awareness of cadres at all levels and state functionaries, and in promoting clean governance.

When talking about this year's work plans, Liu Fuzhi said, the procuratorial organs will continue to adhere to the policy of striking hard and swiftly against serious criminal elements and severely punishing serious economic criminals in accordance with the law, and will continue to carry out the work of combating corruption and bribery.

　　刘复之谈打击经济犯罪
    反贪污受贿要抓到底
    据新华社北京３月１８日电  （记者陈雁）最高人民检察院检察长刘复之日前接受记者采访时强调，检察机关要把反对贪污受贿的斗争进行到底。
    刘复之说，去年１１月召开全国检察长工作会议后，根据党中央的方针和有关法律规定，针对实际形势，我们突出强调了把反贪污受贿犯罪作为检察机关的工作重点，放在打击经济犯罪的第一位。去年下半年与上半年相比，贪污大案立案数增加３５％。一些地方的检察院还集中力量破获了一批难度较大的案件。另外，检察机关根据举报，查获了少数领导干部和发生在中央机关的贪污、受贿案件。从目前情况看，开展反贪污、受贿犯罪工作对提高广大群众的信心和同贪污、受贿犯罪作斗争的积极性，对增强各级领导干部和国家工作人员的法制观念，对廉政建设，都起到较好作用。
    在谈到今年的工作打算时，刘复之说，检察机关要继续坚持依法从重从快打击严重刑事犯罪分子和依法从严惩处严重经济犯罪分子的方针，把反贪污反受贿工作一直抓下去。
