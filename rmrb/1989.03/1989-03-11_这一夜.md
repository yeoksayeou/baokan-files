This night the clouds and trees hang low
The skylark
	At the edge of the fields sings
A meteor shower
	Beats against my scattered lines of verse
I breathe you in and my heart gradually turns blue
The drum has begun to beat faintly
The sea far away in some place throbs deeply
You bend over the clean surface of the lake, your long hair floating
With a wave of your hand, frangipani blossoms cascade down the valley
In the wind, I feel desire quietly burning
And dawn is slowly rising along the haystacks by the village
Moonlight is soft, fallen leaves flutter
Your memories
Are the geese flying north over the maple forest at night
Oh, this is what I want to tell you
I will caress every breeze, every vein of every leaf, to reach you
Your autumn waters have already risen over my shoulders

专栏：

　　这一夜
    王长安
    这一夜云树低垂
    知更鸟
    　在田野尽头鸣啭
    流星雨
    　敲打我散乱的诗行
    我呼吸你而心已渐渐变蓝
    那面鼓已隐隐敲响
    大海在远方某处深切搏动
    你弯身于洁净的湖面上长发飘
      散
    一抬手栀子花便涌下山谷
    风声中我感到渴望在静静燃烧
    而黎明正沿着村旁草垛缓缓升腾
    月色溶溶，落叶飘飘
    你的回忆
    是枫林中北渡的夜雁
    噢，这就是我要对你说的
    我将抚摸着每一缕风每一条
      叶脉走向你
    你的秋水已漫过我的双肩
