	Hu Jintao Meets with Australian Ambassador to China

	According to a report from the Tibet Daily, yesterday afternoon, Hu Jintao, Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, met with Colin Hearst, the Australian Ambassador to China, and his wife, who were visiting Tibet.

	When Colin Hearst raised the issue of handling and suppressing several disturbances, Hu Jintao said, "In handling and suppressing these disturbances, our fundamental focus is on the broad masses of the people. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the series of special policies and measures implemented by the Party in Tibet have brought benefits that the broad masses have seen and heard about. They do not want chaos and oppose disturbances. They firmly support the Party's good policies. On the other hand, for those with vague understandings, we patiently educate them with reason, help them distinguish right from wrong, and we only punish the very few lawbreakers, dealing with them according to the law."

	Ambassador Hearst said, "Our position is very clear; we have always acknowledged that Tibet is part of China."

    胡锦涛会见澳大利亚驻华公使
    本报拉萨3月1日电　据西藏日报报道：昨天下午，西藏自治区党委书记胡锦涛在拉萨会见了前来参观访问的澳大利亚驻华公使柯林·赫索尔蒂恩及夫人。
    当柯林·赫索尔蒂恩谈起平息和处理几起骚乱事件的问题时，胡锦涛说，在平息和处理有关骚乱问题时，我们最根本的着眼点是广大人民群众。三中全会以来党在西藏实行的一系列特殊方针、政策所带来的好处，广大群众是耳闻目睹的，他们都不希望动乱，反对骚乱。他们坚决拥护党的好政策。另一方面，对有模糊认识的群众，进行耐心的以理服人的教育，帮助分清是非，我们只打击极少数违背法律的犯罪分子，对他们依法惩处。
    公使先生说，我们的态度是很明确的，一直承认西藏是中国的一部分。
