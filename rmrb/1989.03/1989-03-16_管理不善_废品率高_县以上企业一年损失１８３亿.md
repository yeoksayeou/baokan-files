Poor management and high defect rates have resulted in an annual loss of approximately 18.3 billion yuan for county-level and above industrial enterprises in China. On March 15, the Seventh Annual Meeting of the China Quality Management Association, held in Shanghai, called for urgent attention to the issue of product quality, which reflects national quality from one aspect.

Currently, over 50,000 state-owned and collective enterprises are implementing total quality management. By the end of 1988, 25 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions had established user committees, set up 45 product tracking stations, and initiated mass quality supervision activities.

　　管理不善　废品率高
    县以上企业一年损失１８３亿
    本报上海３月１５日电  记者董焕亮报道：我国县以上工业企业由于管理不善、废次品率高等原因，一年损失约达１８３亿元以上。３月１５日在上海召开的中国质量管理协会第七次年会呼吁，一定要充分重视从一个侧面反映民族素质的产品质量问题。
    目前推行全面质量管理的全民所有制和集体所有制的企业已达５万余个，截至１９８８年底，全国已有２５个省、市、自治区成立了用户委员会，建立了４５个产品跟踪站，开展起群众性的质量监督活动。
