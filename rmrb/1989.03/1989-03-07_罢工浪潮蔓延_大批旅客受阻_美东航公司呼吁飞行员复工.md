Strike Wave Spreads, Large Number of Passengers Stranded
Eastern Air Lines Urges Pilots to Return to Work

	New York, March 5 (Xinhua) — Eastern Air Lines today called on pilots who joined the mechanics' strike to return to work immediately to help the company, which is on the verge of paralysis, get through the crisis.

	The mechanics' union of the company went on strike at midnight on March 3 due to a wage dispute.

	The pilots' union of the company responded to the call and held a solidarity strike.

	Eastern Air Lines is one of the largest airlines in the United States, with 1,040 flights daily, carrying 100,000 passengers.

	However, due to the impact of the strike, Eastern Air Lines today operated only 56 flights, leaving a large number of passengers stranded at the airport.

	The company said that if the pilots continue the strike, it will seriously threaten the company's survival, "which is undoubtedly an act of economic suicide."

	Due to concerns about nationwide transportation chaos, U.S. Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner today warned that if any other airline or railroad workers join the strike, it will be considered an illegal act.

　　罢工浪潮蔓延　大批旅客受阻
    美东航公司呼吁飞行员复工
    新华社华盛顿３月５日电  美国东方航空公司今天呼吁加入机械师罢工行列的飞行员立即复工，以帮助濒临瘫痪的公司渡过难关。
    该公司的机械师联合会因工资问题，于３日午夜开始罢工。
    该公司的飞行员协会响应号召，也举行了声援罢工。
    东方航空公司是美最大的航空公司之一，每天有１０４０个航班，接送１０万旅客。
    但是，由于受到罢工的影响，东方航空公司今天只发出了５６个航班，大批旅客受阻在机场。
    该公司表示，如果飞行员继续罢工下去，将严重威胁到公司的生存，“这无疑是一次经济自杀”。
    由于担心出现全国性的交通运输混乱，美交通部长斯金纳今天警告说，如果再有任何航空公司和铁路运输部门的工作人员举行声援罢工，都将被视为违法行为。
