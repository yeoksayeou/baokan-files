Major commemorative activities often simultaneously serve as a rethinking and reinterpretation of their significance. We can observe that, in different historical contexts, the emphasis on the May Fourth spirit often shifts with the changing political hotspots of the time. In the 1950s and 1960s, we emphasized the direction of the May Fourth movement as intellectuals uniting with workers and peasants. Starting in the late 1970s, people began to focus again on the enlightenment and democracy aspects of the May Fourth spirit—“thought liberation.”

In the 1980s, when we commemorated the May Fourth movement, people seemed to focus on three points: democracy, science, and anti-feudalism. However, the question arises: do we still need to seriously rethink these three points today?

Since Chen Duxiu proposed science and democracy during the May Fourth movement, seventy years have passed. Why does China still need science and democracy today? Since Wu Yu called for the overthrow of the "Confucian shop" and Lu Xun shouted for the overthrow of the cannibalistic old ethics, seventy years have also passed. Why are we still advocating for "anti-feudalism" and criticizing China's old cultural traditions? Does this mean that China's history over the past seventy years has merely been spinning in place?

If we analyze more deeply, we will find that terms like "science," "democracy," and "anti-feudalism," though seemingly correct, are actually very abstract. Because of their abstraction, they are always correct. But precisely because of their abstraction, people can assign them perhaps completely different meanings.

Practice is the sole criterion for testing truth. The evaluation of the significance of a historical event should consider what kind of historical fruits this event ultimately bore. Seventy years later, looking back at the May Fourth movement, we should not only consider what tasks the pioneers of that time proposed. We should also ask: in the series of developments driven by the May Fourth movement, what problems has China actually solved, what problems has it not solved, and what new problems has it encountered?

The banner of the May Fourth movement was democracy and science. China today certainly cannot be said to lack its own "democracy" and "science." Some say that although they exist, the degree is not sufficient. However, how much is "sufficient"?

I believe that the real problem may lie here: if, in the sense understood by the May Fourth pioneers, China has already broken through and even shattered its old traditions, if China already possesses and has established some form of science and democracy (which is undeniable), and if China has long since emerged from the so-called feudal system, then why has China not yet modernized? This is the true crux of the dilemma.

Modernization means the reshaping of cultural forms. In the early 19th century, China, seemingly unprepared, was pushed into the global tide by Western powers led by Britain, forcing it to seek change and adaptation. China thus painfully entered a long process of groping and pursuing modernization. If we count from 1840, it has been nearly one hundred and fifty years, and China is still struggling and striving on this difficult path.

The May Fourth movement was a significant event in this process. In my view, the significance of the May Fourth movement lies mainly in the following points: before the May Fourth movement, the focus of the elite in pursuing China's transformation was on military affairs ("strengthening the army"), economy ("enriching the country"), technology and industry ("industrial salvation"), and politics, leading to reforms and revolutions such as the Self-Strengthening Movement, the Hundred Days' Reform, and the Xinhai Revolution. However, on the basis of the failure of these movements, the elite figures of the May Fourth period, known as the "New Youth," such as Chen Duxiu, Hu Shi, Li Dazhao, and Lu Xun, shifted their focus to cultural forms, social systems, value systems, and ideologies, moving from the concrete to the abstract, from the material to the spiritual. They thus proposed the transformation of the national soul, national consciousness, and national character, as well as national dignity and personal dignity.

Before the May Fourth movement, people often focused on seeking modernization within the framework of old institutions and traditional culture (this is the deep meaning of "Chinese essence, Western application"). It was not until the May Fourth movement that the slogans of literary revolution, cultural revolution, and social revolution were raised, attempting to achieve a comprehensive transformation and reconstruction of cultural forms and social systems. This was a profound leap. However, culture is a very difficult concept to define. What is called "Chinese culture" is easy to understand in general terms, but upon closer examination, it is not so simple. In fact, Chinese culture presents different forms and value systems in different historical periods and also shows great differences in different regions and ethnic groups. Therefore, it is simplistic to speak of inheritance, negation, or sublation in general terms.

I believe that, from its own standards, Chinese culture has been quite successful. It is a highly adaptable and internally coordinated culture in human agricultural civilization. The problem encountered by modern Chinese culture is mainly that, as a type of agricultural culture, it has fallen behind and become uncoordinated in comparison with the impact and contrast of Western science-technology-industry-market culture, thus necessitating "modernization," that is, the requirement to transcend its own structure and create a Chinese science-technology-industry-market culture.

Therefore, modernization necessarily means a transformation of cultural forms and overall cultural design. In this transformation, except for the preservation of the national self-awareness of the Chinese people (without which there would be no cohesion, and the state and nation would be difficult to exist), everything can be sublated, reconstructed, and rebuilt. Social transformation often proceeds from the whole (design) to the parts (specifics). The transformation of ideology and cultural spirit should precede economic, political, and social reforms. Without the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Enlightenment, there would have been no modernization movement in the West. Without the May Fourth movement, there would have been no Northern Expedition and the founding of New China in 1949. The lack of cultural spirit and ideological modernization transformation is precisely one of the reasons why the current reform has fallen into a passive situation.

The importance of cultural change for modernization lies in the fact that the history of modernization in all countries since the 19th century has shown that modernization cannot be directly grafted or transplanted from outside a society into its interior. The advanced technology, industry, science, and social forms of the West have their deep historical and cultural backgrounds. They naturally and necessarily emerged from the background of ancient Greek, Roman, and Hebrew traditions, as well as from the background of the Renaissance, Reformation, and Enlightenment. Therefore, China's modernization should also organically and logically grow out of the creative transformation of its own social and cultural background.

Some people are concerned that if a new generation of scholars proposes the need for a calm and profound reflection on the May Fourth movement, especially the radical spirit of the May Fourth period, it will lead to a negation of the May Fourth spirit.

In fact, the greatness of the May Fourth movement needs no defense. Almost the entire history of 20th-century China has been under the profound influence of the May Fourth spirit. When we proposed the "Four Modernizations" at the end of the 1970s, we were actually, unconsciously, returning to a problem prior to the May Fourth period—the problem of "essence" and "application." Because we had tried to maintain the basic invariance of the already constructed and fixed institutions, ideologies, value systems, and overall cultural background (this is called "essence") while externally transplanting four useful elements: modern industry, modern agriculture, modern military technology, and modern science (this is called "application"). However, as the reform deepened, it became increasingly clear that, under the condition of not changing certain "essences," modernization and the old value system and ideology increasingly conflicted. This led to the need for a new enlightenment, that is, the opposition to obscurantism, which we then called "thought liberation." It was on the basis of the deepening of thought liberation that a new generation of people once again became aware of the spirit of the May Fourth movement: modernization is not a simple problem of essence and application; modernization must have roots and soil. This root and soil should appear in the process of the reorganization and reshaping of China's social and cultural forms. Thus, the 1980s seemed to have returned to the era of the May Fourth movement. History indeed develops in a spiral. In this sense, the cultural fever of the 1980s in China can indeed be considered a direct relay and continuation of the May Fourth spirit.

However, the development of history does make one feel perplexed. If today we are merely replaying the old tunes of seventy years ago in a new historical context, this can only indicate the poverty and incompetence of the new generation of Chinese intellectual elites in the 1980s.

We should say, "May Fourth is great!" But we must transcend the May Fourth movement. Only in this way can we realize the great historical mission left by the May Fourth pioneers to their successors, which has not yet been completed: to modernize China as soon as possible.

One characteristic of the May Fourth movement was its radical anti-traditionalism. However, today we must question this radical anti-traditionalism.

The historical experience of countries that have already achieved modernization shows that the primary prerequisite for modernization is the sustained, continuous, and stable development of economy, politics, and culture. There has never been a country that has achieved modernization through constant social upheavals (though often occurring under the name of "revolution"). In the history of the 19th century and beyond, we see this rule: the more a country's economic and political development process is discontinuous and lacks continuity, the more difficult and tortuous its modernization process will be. On the contrary, countries where economic, political, and cultural development maintains continuous and relatively stable progress through peaceful evolution and gradual reform have achieved more notable results in their modernization process, with less suffering for the people. Examples include Britain, the United States, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, and the Nordic countries.

In the past, people said that only radical violent revolutions could liberate productive forces. Historical facts challenge the universal applicability of this proposition. Looking at Britain and France, which have extremely similar historical and cultural backgrounds, people used to say that the British bourgeois revolution was not thorough, while France experienced the 1789 Revolution, as well as the 1848 and 1871 revolutions, with political upheavals such as the restoration and counter-restoration of the monarchy, and the index of social upheavals was clearly higher than in Britain. However, in terms of the process of modernization and economic growth, Britain long led France. The experience of newly industrialized countries and regions in Asia also shows that social stability and the continuous development of economics and politics are more beneficial than leapfrog-style, abrupt development. Statistical models of the past two hundred years of development in various countries around the world show: the frequency and intensity of social upheavals are inversely proportional to the process of modernization. There seems to be a historical law here.

We can observe that, among the countries of the 19th century and beyond, China has experienced the highest and most frequent social upheavals, which is certainly due to objective historical reasons. The result is that China's modernization process has been delayed. Over the past hundred years, history has shown that China has always suffered from radicalism and impatience. This sentiment arises from a sense of national inferiority caused by a century of backwardness. However, the result is that the social psychology and political system are extremely unstable, the economy cannot develop steadily and continuously, and cultural achievements are difficult to accumulate. A large number of talents, elites, and material wealth are wasted and sacrificed in social upheavals. This is the reason why, despite having the most radical ideology and rapid surface-level political and economic development, social progress is still very slow. Therefore, reflecting on history, abandoning radicalism in ideology and political form, connecting the disrupted national cultural tradition, and cultivating and growing modern culture from the roots of our own national tradition are important aspects of transcending the May Fourth movement today.

Since 1978, China's reform, despite numerous difficulties and twists and turns, has shown a historical trend of continuous deepening. It began with the thawing of literature and art and the enlightenment of thought, then turned to economic reform; from the early policy changes, it deepened into institutional reform, and simultaneously from economics, it penetrated into politics and extended to culture. However, it is worth noting that, from the May Fourth movement to the present, China's modernization movement has always had a major weakness: it has overly emphasized the material and technical factors in the process of modernization but often overlooked the issue of the reconstruction of people.

The issue of people, in essence, is the issue of liberation. We can observe that the history of many countries shows that the process of social modernization is, in essence, the liberation of people from the feudal dependency and hierarchical identity systems of the Middle Ages, allowing intellectuals to think freely and the common people to create freely, thereby fully unleashing people's wisdom and initiative.

Generally, modern society can obtain unlimited positive energy and vitality from its members. After the Renaissance, we clearly see in Western societies, first among intellectuals and then in almost all social strata, that individual creativity and initiative have been greatly enhanced. This social and cultural institution that guarantees individual members the opportunity to display creativity is a major secret of the successful modernization of many countries but is a major issue that we have overlooked in our pursuit of modernization. In fact, according to Marx's theory of socialism, a socialist society should provide the greatest possible opportunities for the development of individual personality. The liberation of people, the liberation of individuality, can only be truly and fully realized in a highly modernized society. Because the degree of liberation of people is directly proportional to the level of social civilization.

It is undeniable that to this day, the social structure of China still lacks an environment conducive to the development of elite culture in many aspects. Countless talents, either due to not receiving appropriate education and cultivation, or not having sufficient opportunities for development after emerging, are constrained and suppressed in their cradles. This problem, in the context of the deepening reform today, has already necessitated high attention from all parties. In this sense, I believe that the reform should shift from its previous overemphasis on material factors to a greater emphasis on the human factors in the process of modernization. We should think about how to eliminate those institutions that suppress and hinder people's inventive and initiative, and create a social environment conducive to the development of individual initiative and creativity.

China has the possibility of achieving a cultural revival in the next fifty years. However, to achieve this, we must rebuild the value system of the Chinese people and rediscover the national spirit—what is called the "national soul." This national spirit is the self-awareness of the Chinese nation, the confidence that the national essence and culture can transition to a new type of modern civilization through self-transformation.

On the other hand, the so-called revival certainly does not mean a return to the past. Revival itself should mean innovation. However, we must not advocate any cultural revolution with radical, irrational characteristics. Cultural renewal first means construction and creation, continuous development based on cultural accumulation. I do not agree with "no destruction, no construction." In culture, the value of construction is higher than that of destruction. Rather than just saying how bad a culture is, it is better to explore how to transform it into something good. Today, the Chinese people need to retrace the deep traditions of national culture. We need to stand on the solid foundation of tradition to seek the opportunity and conditions for a creative transformation towards modern culture.

The May Fourth movement proposed the task of criticizing Confucius, opposing Confucianism, and destroying the old feudal culture. This task was later quite thoroughly implemented. If we compare today's China with Eastern countries and regions that have also received Confucian cultural education, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore, we can say that we are the furthest from this tradition. In contrast, today's China is already, in the sense of surface culture, the nation most distant from Confucian tradition. Whether this is a gain or a loss is a question that seems to require further study. However, it is worth noting that, on the one hand, a thorough rebellion against tradition does not equal modernization. On the other hand, if we acknowledge the rapid development of these countries and regions in recent years, then we indeed need to strongly question the radical proposition that "Chinese traditional culture must be completely negated and cannot coexist with modern civilization."

Here we should note that the beginning of Western modernization was under the banner of the revival of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, which was not a historical accident. Today, we must also rebuild the great tradition of the Chinese nation. We must re-evaluate the value of our civilization and shape the new soul of our nation. This shaping should also mean a re-recognition and re-interpretation of tradition. In this interpretation, we should rebuild the modern Chinese people's sense of dignity and confidence in our national history and culture.

World history shows that the modernization movements of various countries (including China's modern history after the May Fourth movement) often originate from cultural movements, while their foundation is economic and political reform. In this process, intellectuals with modern ideas and the ability to assume social responsibility play a major role in various fields. Without intellectuals, there is no modern civilization. Similarly, in China's march towards modernization, Chinese intellectuals also bear a great historical responsibility.

Under the premise of social stability and the deepening of thought and cultural reform and openness, we have reason to expect that Chinese culture will achieve a comprehensive revival in the next century.

　　“五四”精神的继承与超越        
    ——中国现代化问题的思考
    何新
    五四精神的真谛
    重大的纪念活动，往往同时是一种重新反思和叙述其意义的阐释活动。
    我们可以注意到，在不同时代的背景下，对于五四精神的强调重点，常以当时时代政治热点的不同而不同。５０、６０年代，我们强调的“五四”方向是知识分子走与工农相结合的方向。７０年代末开始，人们重新关注的则是五四精神中的启蒙与民主——“思想解放”。
    ８０年代我们纪念“五四”，人们关注的似乎集中于这三点：民主、科学，以及反封建。但是，问题在于，对于这三点，我们今天是否也有必要重新再作一番认真的反思！
    自从五四运动中陈独秀提出科学与民主，已经七十年了，为什么今天中国需要的还是科学与民主？自从吴虞提出打倒“孔家店”，鲁迅喊出推翻吃人的旧礼教，也已经七十年了，为什么今天还在呼吁：“反封建”和批判中国的旧文化传统？难道七十年来的中国历史，仅仅是在原地空转了一圈吗？
    如果更深刻地辨析一下，我们会发现：所谓“科学”、“民主”、“反封建”，这些似乎很正确的提法，其实又是很抽象的。正因为其抽象，所以永远正确。但也正是因为其抽象，人们可以对其赋予也许完全不同的涵义。
    实践是检验真理的唯一标准。对于一个历史事件意义的估价，应当看这一事件最终结出了什么样的历史果实。七十年后重看“五四”，我们不仅应当考虑当时的先驱者们曾提出过什么任务。还应当问，在由“五四”所带动的一系列后继的发展中，中国实际解决了哪些问题，没能解决哪些问题，又引发和遇到了哪些新的问题。
    “五四”的旗帜是民主与科学。中国今天当然不能说还没有自己的“民主”和“科学”。有人说，虽然有，但是程度还不够。然而，怎样才能算“够”呢？
    我以为，真正的问题也许在这里：既然在“五四”先驱者所理解的意义上，中国已经突破、甚至粉碎了它的旧传统，既然中国已经具有和建立了某种形态的科学与民主（这是无疑的），既然中国早已走出了所谓“封建制度”，那么为什么中国直到今天还没有现代化呢？这个问题才是困境的真正所在。
    　　　　现代化意味着文化形态的重新塑造
    十九世纪初叶，中国在自身似乎毫无准备的情势下，被英国为首的西方列强推入了世界洪流，不得不寻求变革和适应。中国由此痛苦地进入了一个不断摸索、追求现代化道路的漫长过程。如果从１８４０年算起，已近一百五十年了，中国却还挣扎、奋斗在这个艰难的历程中。
    五四运动就是这个过程中的一个特殊重大的事件。以我所见，“五四”的意义主要在于以下诸点：“五四”以前，精英分子追求中国变革的着眼点，曾分别集中在军事（“强兵”）、经济（“富国”）、技术与工业（实业救国）、政治等方面，由是发生洋务、戊戌、辛亥等改革和革命的运动。但是，在这些运动先后失败的基础上，五四时期那些号称“新青年”的精英人物陈独秀、胡适、李大钊、鲁迅把目光转移到文化形态、社会制度、价值体系、意识形态上来，从具体深入于抽象，从物质进入于精神。由此提出了改造国民灵魂、国民意识和民族性格，以及国格与人格的问题。
    “五四”以前，国人多着眼于从旧制度和传统文化的大框架内求取社会中若干枝节的现代化（这就是所谓“中体西用”的深层含义）。直到五四运动，才提出了文学革命、文化革命、社会革命的口号，试图实现文化形态、社会制度的全面转变和改造。这是一个深刻的飞跃。但是，文化是一个很不容易确定的概念。所谓“中国文化”，泛论之似乎不难理会，但细察之则实不然。事实上，中国文化在不同时代呈现的形态和价值观并不完全相同；不同地域与民族也呈现很大差异。所以，笼统地讲继承、否定或扬弃，均有简单化之嫌。
    我以为，中国文化就自身标准看，曾经是相当成功的。它是人类农业文明中极具有适应力、具备内部协调功能的一种高水平文化。近代中国文化所遇到的问题，主要是作为一种农业类型的中国传统文化。由于与西方的科技—工业—市场文化的冲击和对比而现出落后、不协调，因而不能不提出“现代化”，即跨越自身构造一种中国的科技—工业—市场文化的要求。
    所以，现代化必然意味着文化形态和文化整体设计的转变。在这种转变中，除了中国人的民族本体意识应当保持（不保持就没有凝聚力，国家、民族就难以存在）外，一切都可以扬弃、改造和重建。社会的变革，往往是先整体（设计），后部分（具体）。意识形态、文化精神的转变应该走在经济、政治、社会改革的前面。没有文艺复兴、宗教改革、启蒙运动，就不会有西方的现代化运动。没有五四运动，也不会有北伐战争和１９４９年新中国的诞生。而缺乏文化精神和意识形态的现代化转变，却正是当代改革陷于被动局面的原因之一。
    　　　　建立现代文化必须有根、有土壤
    文化变迁对于现代化之所以重要，是因为十九世纪以来所有国家现代化的历史都表明，现代化不能自一个社会外部向内部作直接的嫁接和移入。西方先进的技术、实业、科学、社会形态自有其深厚的历史文化背景渊源。它是从西方古代的希腊、罗马以及希伯来传统的背景上，从文艺复兴、宗教改革和启蒙思潮的背景上，自然而且必然地生发出来的。正因为如此，中国的现代化，也应当从中国自身社会文化背景的创造性转变中，有机地、合于逻辑地生长出来。
    有人担心，新一代学者中有人提出，有必要冷静、深刻地反省“五四”，特别是五四时期的激进主义精神，会导致对五四精神的否定。
    实际上，“五四”的伟大何须辩护？二十世纪中国的几乎整个历史，都笼罩在五四精神的深远影响之中。当我们在７０年代末重新提出“四个现代化”问题的时候，我们实际上是在新的历史水平和意义上，不自觉地回归到一个前于五四时期的问题——“体”与“用”的问题。因为我们曾试图在现代已构建定型的制度、意识形态、价值体系即整体文化背景（是谓“体”）基本维持不变的前提下，自外向内地移植四种有用的要素：现代工业、现代农业、现代军事技术、现代科学（是谓“用”）。但是随着改革的深化发展，事情就变得愈来愈明显，在不变革某些“体”的条件下，现代化与旧的价值体系、意识形态发生了愈来愈深刻的冲突。由此再度发生了重新启蒙，即反对蒙昧主义的需要——当时我们称之为思想解放。而正是在思想解放深化的基础上，新一代人再次意识到“五四”的精神：现代化不是简单的体用问题，现代化必须有根、有土壤。这根与土壤应当出现在中国社会文化形态重新整合与塑造的过程中。于是，８０年代似乎又回现了“五四”的时代。历史的确是螺旋式地发展的。就这一意义论，８０年代中国知识界的文化热，的确可以认为是五四精神的直接接力和继续。
    然而，历史的发展毕竟令人感到惶惑。如果今天我们仍然不过是在新的历史背景下，重弹七十年前的老调，那么这只能表明８０年代中国新一代知识精英的贫乏和无能。
    我们应该说，“五四”是伟大的！但是我们必须超越“五四”。只有这样，我们才能实现“五四”先驱者留给后人而至今尚未完成的伟大历史使命：让中国早日实现现代化。
    　　　　激进反传统不利于现代化
    五四运动的特征之一，是激进的反传统主义。但是今天，我们却不能不对这种激进反传统主义提出质疑。
    世界上那些已实现现代化国家的历史经验都表明，现代化的首要前提是经济、政治、文化获得持久、连续、稳定的发展。还没有一个国家是通过社会不断发生动乱（尽管往往以“革命”的名义发生）而实现了现代化的。十九世纪以来的世界历史中，我们倒看到这样的规律：经济和政治发展进程愈是呈现断裂而缺少连续性的国家，其现代化进程就愈是困难和曲折。相反地，经济、政治、文化的发展以和平演变、改良性渐进的模式保持连续而比较稳定发展的国家，在现代化进程中人民所受苦难较小，成就却比较显著。例如：英国、美国、日本、加拿大、瑞士以及北欧诸国，都是例证。过去人们讲，只有激进的暴力革命才能解放生产力。历史事实对这个命题的普遍适用性提出了挑战。以历史、文化背景极为相似的英国和法国来看，过去人们总说英国资产阶级革命不彻底，而法国则爆发了１７８９年的大革命，又发生过１８４８、１８７１年的革命，其间还有政治上王朝复辟与反复辟的多次交替，社会动乱指数明显地高于英国。但是，就现代化的进程和经济增长而言，英国曾长期领先于法国。亚洲新兴工业化国家和地区的经验也表明，社会稳定、经济政治保持非断裂的连续发展，比跃进式的突变式发展更有效益。最近二百年来世界各国发展的统计模型表明：社会动乱的频率与激进程度，同其现代化的进程恰恰呈现反比例的关系。这里似乎有一个历史规律。
    我们可以注意到，在十九世纪以来的世界各国中，以中国发生社会动荡的频率最高、最密集，这当然是有其客观历史原因的。其结果是导致中国的现代化进程的滞缓。一百多年以来历史的经验表明，中国总是吃激进主义、急躁情绪的亏。这种情绪来自一百年来由于落后而造成的民族自卑感。但结果是，社会的心理、政治系统极不稳定，经济得不到稳定连续的发展，文化成果难以积累。大量的人才、精英和物质财富在社会动乱中白白消耗、牺牲。这就是虽然具有最激进的意识形态，虽然有社会表层政治、经济发展的迅速跃进，但社会的真正进步却甚为缓慢的原因。因此，反省历史，摆脱意识和政治形态中的激进主义，连接已断裂的民族文化传统，从我们民族的自身传统中，有根基地培育和生长出现代文化，是今天超越“五四”的一个重要方面。
    　　　　调动社会成员的自身动力
    １９７８年以来的中国改革，尽管困难重重，曲折不断，但仍然呈现出不断深化的历史走向。它由文艺解冻、思想启蒙发轫，其后转入经济改革；由早期的政策转变深化为体制改造，同时由经济渗入政治，扩及于文化。但值得注意的是，自“五四”迄今，中国的现代化运动始终有一个极大的弱点，这就是过于重视现代化进程中的物质因素和技术因素，却往往忽视了现代化进程中关于人的重新塑造的问题。
    人的问题，在本质上是人的解放问题。我们可以注意到，许多国家的历史表明，社会现代化的进程，实质首先是将人从中世纪那种封建依附制度和等级身份制度中解放出来，使知识分子能够自由思想，平民能够自由创造，从而使人的聪明才智和主动精神得到充分发挥的过程。
    一般来说，现代社会能够从其成员自身，获得无限发展的积极动力和活力。文艺复兴以后，我们在西方社会中明显地看到，首先在知识分子中，同时也在社会几乎所有阶层中，个人创造力和主动精神获得了无比的增强。这种保证个别社会成员享有施展创造性机会的社会文化制度，是许多国家现代化成功的主要秘密之一，却是至今被我们在追求现代化时所忽视的一个重大问题。实际上，根据马克思关于社会主义的理论，社会主义社会正是应当为人的个性发展提供最充分的可能。人的解放、个性的解放，只有在高度现代化的社会中，才获得真正充分的实现。因为人的解放程度与社会文明的发展水平是成正比例的。
    无庸讳言，直到今日，中国社会结构在许多方面仍然缺乏一个有利于精英文化发展的环境。无数英才或者由于得不到适宜的教育、培养，或者是崭露头角后得不到发展的充分机会，而被困锁、扼制在襁褓和摇篮中。这个问题在改革正在日益深化的今天，已有必要引起各方面的高度重视。在这个意义上，我认为，改革应当从以往过于偏重物质方面的因素，转移到更加重视现代化过程中人的因素。我们应当思考如何革除那些抑制、挫伤人的发明创造力和主动性的不良制度，创造一种有利于发挥社会中个人主动和首创精神的社会环境。
    　　　　重建民族文化的优秀传统
    中国极有可能在未来五十年内获得自己的文化复兴。但是，为了实现这一点，必须重建中国人的价值观，重新找到中国的民族精神——也就是所谓“国魂”。这种民族精神，是中华民族的自我意识，是对于中华民族和本体文化——确信它可以从自身的转化中过渡为社会主义的新型现代文明的充分自尊与自信。
    另一方面，所谓复兴当然并非意味着复古。复兴本身就应当意味着革新。但是，我们决不能再倡导任何具有激进、非理性特征的“文化革命”。文化更新首先意味着建设、创造，在文化积累基础上的持续发展。我不同意“不破不立”。在文化上，立的价值高于破。与其只说一种文化怎样不好，莫如探索怎样才能使之转变为好。今天，中国人有必要回溯民族文化的深厚传统。需要立足于传统的深厚根基上，寻求向现代文化作创造性转化的契机和条件。
    “五四”提出了批孔、反儒、摧毁封建旧文化的任务。这一任务在后来得到了相当彻底的实现。如果以今天的中国，与东方那些曾共同接受过儒家文化熏陶的国家和地区，如日本、南朝鲜、台湾地区、新加坡等相比，可以说我们已比任何人更远离于这一传统。相形之下，今天的中国早已是在表层文化的意义上，最疏远于儒家传统的一个民族了。究竟孰得孰失，这个问题却似乎还有待进一步研究。但是值得注意的是，一方面，彻底地反叛传统并不等于实现现代化。另一方面，如果我们承认这些国家或地区近年来发展很快的现象，那么我们就的确有必要对“中国传统文化必须全盘否定，其与现代文明不能并存”这一激进命题表示强烈的质疑。
    在这里我们应当注意，西方走向现代化的开端，是以希腊罗马古代文明的复兴为旗帜的，这并不是一种历史的偶然。在今天，我们同样必须重建中华民族的伟大传统。我们必须重新估计我们文明的价值，塑造我们民族新的灵魂。这种塑造，同时也应当意味着对传统的重新认识和重新阐释。要在这种阐释中，重建现代中国人对于我们民族历史文化的尊严感和自信心。
    世界历史表明，各国现代化运动（“五四”以后的中国现代史也如此），往往起源于文化运动，而其基础则是经济政治的改革。在这个过程中，具有现代观念而能够承担社会责任的知识分子，在各个领域中发挥着重大的作用。没有知识分子，就没有现代文明。同样，在中国走向现代化的过程中，中国知识分子也承担着重大的历史责任。
    在社会安定和思想文化的改革、开放不断深化的前提下，我们将有理由期待中国文化在下一世纪得到全面的振兴。
