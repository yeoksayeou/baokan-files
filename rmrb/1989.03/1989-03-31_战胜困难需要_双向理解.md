	Overcoming Difficulties Requires "Mutual Understanding"

	"Prices are rising again," "It's so hard to get a ride," "Teachers' status is too low" — these days, such complaints from the public are often heard.

	"Eating meat while cursing," "Too little understanding of the government's difficulties" — some government officials also often express similar grievances.

	At the People's Congress, some representatives believe that these complaints have some merit, but they do not solve the problem. Our era needs more mutual understanding between the government and the people.

		Mayor and Teacher

	In the Liaoning delegation, the reporter discussed education issues with the mayor of Shenyang, Wu Di Sheng. His first words were: "The problem of low pay for primary and secondary school teachers has not been completely solved, and I, as the mayor, have not done a good job!"

	According to the representatives of the People's Congress in Shenyang, Wu Di Sheng saw that primary and secondary school teachers work hard and live poorly, and he felt very heavy-hearted. He decided to cut administrative expenses and other expenditures, squeezing out 20 million yuan each year to subsidize primary and secondary school teachers. This way, each teacher's monthly income can increase by 30 yuan, reaching above the average income of Shenyang's public sector employees. Wu Di Sheng said, "Although this money cannot solve many problems, I feel a little better in my heart." Representative of the People's Congress, Principal Zhang Feng Lin of Nan Jing Street Primary School in Shenyang's He Ping District, told the reporter, "The municipal government cares about teachers, and teachers love their work even more. Our art teacher, Xue Kun, has a high level of professional skill and has represented the country in international academic exchanges. Several times, people invited him to paint advertisements, and the income for one day would be equal to his monthly salary, but he refused. To this day, more than 60 of his students' works have been exhibited domestically and internationally."

		Premier and Miner

	Representative of the People's Congress, miner Ai You Qin of Kai Luan Mine, said: "Mining is a hard, tiring, dirty, and dangerous job, and the pay is not high, but the country has not forgotten us. The other day, Premier Li Peng presided over a meeting to decide to allocate special funds to support the Kai Luan Mining Bureau, and the Tangshan municipal government also allocates several million yuan each year to subsidize the lives of miners. As a miner, one should think more about the country." At the end of November last year, he saw that the entire bureau's production was slipping, and he was anxious. He invited several hundred labor models and advanced producers to a movie screening and gave them encouragement. By the end of the year, the entire bureau had overproduced.

		Country and Farmer

	Representative of the People's Congress, "Grain Sales Champion" Tang Shun Yi of Hebei Province, said: "In recent years, I have sold 260,000 kilograms of grain to the country, reducing income by 800,000 yuan compared to market sales. Some people say I am foolish, but I used to be an accountant and can calculate these accounts. Currently, the grain procurement price is a bit low, but the country is thinking of ways for farmers. If the grain price is raised too high at once, the country and urban residents will not be able to bear it. We cannot force the country to print more money. Besides, farmers are the beneficiaries of reform. Previously, my family's per capita annual income was 37 yuan, and now it has reached over 1,000 yuan. When the country has difficulties, we should share the burden."

	Some representatives believe that mutual understanding is an effective way to mobilize people's enthusiasm. Promoting this method is especially important at present. Otherwise, cohesion will be destroyed, and centrifugal tendencies will increase. One representative introduced that a mayor in a certain southern city had a dialogue with the people, and the people raised sharp opinions on issues such as prices and social order. This mayor became angry and shouted, "Is being a mayor so easy? You come and try it!" The dialogue turned into a scolding session, and this mayor was voted out during the government reshuffle.

	Some representatives believe that the people should understand more of the government's difficulties and provide more constructive opinions; the government should understand more of the people's hardships and improve the transparency of social work. In this way, our work will be much easier.

### 战胜困难需要“双向理解”

　　战胜困难需要“双向理解”
    “物价又涨了”、“乘车太难了”、“教师地位太低了”，时下经常听到群众类似的抱怨。
    “一边吃肉一边骂娘”、“太不理解政府的难处了”，一些政府官员也经常发出类似的牢骚。
    人代会上，一些代表认为，这些抱怨都有一定道理，但都不能解决问题。我们这个时代更需要多一些政府和群众之间的“双向理解”。
    　　　　市长与教师
    在辽宁代表团，记者同沈阳市长武迪生谈起教育问题。他的第一句话就是：“中小学教师的待遇偏低问题没彻底解决，我这个市长没有当好！”
    据沈阳市的人大代表介绍，武迪生看到中小学教师工作辛苦、生活清苦，心情非常沉重。他决定压缩行政经费和其它开支，每年挤出２０００万元，补贴中小学教师。这样，每位教师人均月收入可增加３０元，达到沈阳事业单位人均收入的平均线以上。武迪生说，“尽管这笔钱不能解决很多问题，我心里总算好受了一点”。人大代表、沈阳市和平区南京街第一小学校长张奉临对记者说，市政府关心教师，教师加倍热爱工作。我校美术教师薛昆业务水平很高，曾代表国家进行国际学术交流。好几次，有人拉他去画广告，一天的收入就等于他一个月的工资，但他拒绝了。到现在，他教的学生已经有６０多幅画参加了国内外展出。
    　　　　总理与矿工
    人大代表、开滦矿工艾有勤说：“挖煤这活儿苦、累、脏、险，待遇也不算高，可国家并没有忘记我们，前些天李鹏总理主持会议，决定拨专款支援开滦矿务局，唐山市政府每年也拿出几千万元来补贴矿工生活。作为矿工，应该多为国家着想。”去年１１月底，他看到全局生产滑坡，急眼了，自己掏钱把几百名劳模、先进生产者请来，开了一个电影招待会，给大家鼓励，到年底全局超产了。
    　　　　国家与农民
    人大代表、河北省“售粮状元”唐顺义说：“近年来我向国家交粮２６万公斤，比市场销售减少收入８０多万元。有人说我傻，可我当过会计，能算清这几笔帐。目前粮食收购价是偏低了些，可国家正在为农民想办法，粮价一下子提太高，国家和城市居民都承受不了，咱不能逼国家多印票子。再说，农民是改革的受益者，以前我家人均年收入３７元，现在达到１０００多元。国家有了困难，我们应当分忧。”
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    一些代表认为，双向理解是调动人的积极性的有效方法。提倡这一方法，在目前尤为重要。否则，凝聚力将被破坏，离心倾向将会增强。一位代表介绍，南方某市长与群众对话，群众就物价、社会治安等问题提出尖锐意见，这位市长竟恼羞成怒，拍着桌子喊：“当市长就这么容易？你来试试！”对话会变成训话会，政府换届时，这位市长被选下来。
    一些代表认为，群众要多体谅政府的难处，多提建设性意见；政府更要多体察群众疾苦，提高社会工作透明度。这样，我们的事业就会好办得多。
