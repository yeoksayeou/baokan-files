Title: Why Is There Again an Oversupply of Pork?

It's strange, strange indeed: just before last year's National Day, various places were urging farmers to deliver fattened pigs. But now, just three or four months later, why is there suddenly an oversupply of pork?

		“Stimulus” plus “Support”

Perhaps it is because of the support from the national budget, but in 1987, a shortage of pork supply once appeared, which led to various places adjusting pork prices at the beginning of the year.

In order to “obtain” pork, various places saw an increase in the purchase price of live pigs, and the market price of pork in agricultural fairs followed suit. With prices rising like this, how could production not be stimulated? Moreover, each local government also supported live pig production: increasing the reward for fattened pigs, increasing the reward for grain, and setting soft but firm pig-raising tasks...

Relevant statistics show that by the end of 1988, the number of live pigs in China reached 337 million, comparable to the highest level in 1986. The number of pigs slaughtered was 269 million, an increase of 9.6% over the previous year.

		“The Effect of Waiting for Higher Prices”

This is also a critical issue.

Last July and August, a buying frenzy occurred nationwide. At that time, many farmers thought that everything was increasing in price, so why not pork? Thus, the phenomenon of “waiting for higher prices to sell” emerged—it was better to keep the pigs than to sell them.

Unexpectedly, after the buying frenzy, autumn grain production decreased, grain prices rose, some places faced a severe shortage of feed, and coupled with the need for money during the Spring Festival, farmers had no choice but to sell the pigs they had held back in the third quarter all at once in the fourth quarter.

In the fourth quarter, the number of fattened pigs slaughtered nationwide accounted for 33% of the annual slaughter. And in the last two months—November and December—this proportion was even higher in the fourth quarter. During the same period, the sales volume in urban areas was basically the same as in previous years, and some places even saw a decrease. With an increase in supply and stable demand, an oversupply was inevitable.

		Strategies to Address the Oversupply

Solving the problem of an oversupply of pork: one can expand sales, and the other can increase processing.

The former has many difficulties, as expanding sales requires a large amount of subsidies, but who will pay? It is known that last year alone, the national budget subsidy for pork was more than 20 billion yuan.

Increasing processing is not a bad strategy. In addition to processing some lean meat, more fat can be cut into pieces for making soap, which not only reduces inventory but also alleviates the current shortage of soap in the market, achieving a “two birds with one stone” effect.

Relevant departments are working hard to address the oversupply. Some experts point out that the more important task is to deeply understand the reasons behind the repeated fluctuations in pork production and sales in recent years, seeking a fundamental solution. Otherwise, treating the symptoms without addressing the root cause, it is possible that after solving the oversupply this year, a shortage will emerge again soon.

This is indeed a wise observation.

### 猪肉何以又胀库？

　　猪肉何以又胀库？
    本报记者  潘岗
    怪事怪事：去年国庆前后，各地还在催农民交肥猪，时不过三四个月，怎么又冒出个猪肉胀库？
    　　　　“刺激”外加“扶持”
    许是有国家财政的支撑，１９８７年一度出现的猪肉供应紧张，“逗”得各地年初就对猪肉价格“下了手”。
    为了“拿”到猪肉，各地生猪收购价格纷纷见涨，农贸市场猪肉“跟风上”。价格这么涨，怎不刺激生产？这还不说，每个地方政府又纷纷对生猪生产加以“扶持”：加大奖售肥，加大奖售粮，还要辅之以软中有硬的养猪任务……
    有关统计资料表明，１９８８年末我国生猪存栏达３．３７亿头，与１９８６年的最高水平不相上下。生猪出栏２．６９亿头，比上年增长９．６％。
    　　　　“待价惜售”效应
    这也是“要命”的事。
    去年７、８月份，全国出现了抢购风。当时，不少农民觉得啥都涨价，猪肉焉能不涨，于是产生了“待价惜售”现象——卖猪不如存猪。
    不想抢购风过后，秋粮减产，粮价上涨，有的地方饲料奇缺，加上春节需要花钱，农民只好把三季度压下来的猪，一股脑儿在四季度售出。
    四季度，全国出栏肥猪占全年出栏数的３３％。而最后两个月——１１、１２月份，又在四季度“独占鳌头”。同期，各地城镇销量基本与往年持平，有的地方还有下降。一升一平，胀库也便成其势了。
    　　　　消胀何以对策
    解决猪肉胀库：一可扩大销售，二可增加加工。
    前者难处颇多，扩销需要巨额补贴，谁掏？要知道，去年仅猪肉一项，国家财政补贴就是２０多亿元。
    增加加工，倒不失为良策，除加工一些精肉外，可以多片一些膘，作制皂用油，不仅削减库存，还可缓解目前市场肥皂的短缺，“一箭双雕”。
    有关部门正在努力消“胀”。一些专家指出，更重要的工作是深刻地认识近年猪肉产销反反复复、起起落落的原因，寻求治本之计。要不，头痛医头，脚痛医脚，说不定今年消了“胀”，过后不久又告起紧缺来。
    此言极是。
