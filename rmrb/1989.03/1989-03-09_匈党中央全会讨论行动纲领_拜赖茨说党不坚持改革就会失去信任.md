Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 7th.

The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Political Bureau member and Central Committee Secretary, János Baireits, said at today's Central Committee plenary session that the Hungarian Party should be a united party, a reforming party, and a party of the people.

According to the Hungarian News Agency, the main agenda of this Central Committee plenary session is to discuss the Hungarian Party's near-term action program. Baireits made a report on this matter.

He emphasized that the Hungarian Party must adhere to its determined reform path, and party members must be reforming communists. If the Hungarian Party does not insist on reform, it will lose the trust of the people.

Baireits said that the draft of the Hungarian Party's near-term action program has gone beyond class boundaries. It is directed towards all strata of the working class, towards intellectuals, towards agricultural laborers, and towards several generations. It hopes to gain the support of small contractors in the production and service sectors and seeks cooperation with all progressive forces in the country.

He pointed out that the Hungarian Party bears the responsibility of overcoming the current crisis, which is the historical mission of the Hungarian Party. To this end, the Hungarian Party must break with the remnants of the distorted and one-sided political model, must draw a clear line with past political errors, subjectivism, and bureaucratism. The party must undergo self-reform in the spirit of thorough reform.

The plenary session discussed this action program and decided to have the drafting committee make revisions, to be discussed by the Political Bureau before being published.

The plenary session also heard a report by the Hungarian Party Central Committee Secretary, Magash Szulush, on current international issues.

The plenary session concluded this evening. The Hungarian Party General Secretary, Karoy Gross, presided over the meeting.

　　匈党中央全会讨论行动纲领
    拜赖茨说党不坚持改革就会失去信任
    新华社布达佩斯３月７日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党政治局委员、中央书记拜赖茨·亚诺什在今天举行的中央全会上说，匈党应成为统一的党、改革的党、人民的党。
    据匈通社报道，这次中央全会的主要议程是讨论匈党近期的行动纲领。拜赖茨就此在全会上作了报告。
    他强调，匈党必须忠于自己确定的改革路线，党员必须是改革的共产党人。匈党如不坚持改革，就会失去人民的信任。
    拜赖茨说，匈党近期的行动纲领草案已超出阶级的范畴，它面向工人阶级各个阶层，面向知识分子，面向农业劳动者，面向几代人。它希望得到在生产和服务领域中的小承包者的支持，并寻求同全国各进步力量的合作。
    他指出，匈党负有摆脱当前危机的责任，这是匈党的历史任务。为此，匈党必须同被歪曲了的，并证明是片面的政治模式的残余决裂，必须同过去的政治错误、主观主义和官僚主义划清界限。党要在彻底改革的精神下进行自我改造。
    全会讨论了这个行动纲领，决定由起草委员会进行修改，交政治局讨论后再公布。
    全会还听取了匈党中央书记絮勒什·马加什就当前国际问题所作的报告。
    全会已于今晚结束。匈党总书记格罗斯·卡罗伊主持了会议。
