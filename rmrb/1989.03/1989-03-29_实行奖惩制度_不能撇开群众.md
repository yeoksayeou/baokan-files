The implementation of a reward and punishment system in enterprises aims to stimulate workers' enthusiasm and initiative, and to better carry out comprehensive quality management. However, to truly achieve this goal, the conditions for rewards and punishments, as well as the entire process, must be made public to the masses.

Take, for example, the current practice within the railway system of awarding 3% of workers with bonus wages annually. Because the conditions and processes are not made public, and the criteria are based on the number of people in each station or section, it often leads to situations where mediocre workers can advance while capable workers do not receive additional wages. This results in phenomena such as personal favoritism in wages, official favoritism in wages, relational favoritism in wages, and welfare wages, all of which are given a legal facade. Some workers, in order to secure personal gains, resort to various means of bribery, networking, and gift-giving, injecting a corrupt element into societal ethics.

The same applies to punishments. For what errors should be punished and to what extent, the policy should be made known to the masses. Only in this way can we avoid using the hard and soft aspects of one's social background, the good and bad of interpersonal relationships, and the weight of contributions to relevant individuals as additional conditions when punishing someone, so that the masses can accept it.

In summary, to accelerate the process of democratic reform and improve the party's and society's ethics, it is necessary to make the operational procedures public, trust the masses, and rely on the masses. The implementation of a reward and punishment system cannot exclude the masses.

### 实行奖惩制度  不能撇开群众

　　实行奖惩制度        
    不能撇开群众
    企业实行奖罚制度，目的是为了激发职工劳动积极性、主动性，更好地进行全面质量管理。然而，要真正达到这个目的，就必须将奖罚的条件，以及奖罚的全过程向群众公开。就拿目前铁路系统内部实行的每年给３％的职工奖励工资为例，因其条件、过程不公开，指标又是以各站、段的人数为依据，这样就往往容易因各站、段人员结构的悬殊，造成一些庸者能晋级、能者加不了工资的现象，使人情工资、官职工资、人缘工资、福利工资等等，都披上了合法的外衣。少数职工为了争得一己之利，便千方百计请客送礼，拉关系，给社会风气中注入了一股浊流。
    惩罚也是一样，犯什么错误应受何等处罚，应把政策交给群众掌握，只有这样，才能在处罚人时避免把社会背景的硬软、人际关系的好坏，向有关人烧香进贡的轻重作为附加条件，群众才能服气。
    总之，要加快民主改革的进程，实现党风、社会风气的好转，就必须公开办事制度，相信群众，依靠群众。实行奖惩制度不能撇开群众。
