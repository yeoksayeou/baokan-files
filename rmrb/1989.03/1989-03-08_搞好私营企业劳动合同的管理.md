Currently, our city has 216 private enterprises with a total of 3,221 employees. The largest private enterprise has over 100 employees. Among these private enterprises, only a small number of employers have signed labor contracts with their employees. Even among those that have signed contracts, the content is often incomplete. The main issues are as follows: First, the quality and quantity of the employees' work are not clearly defined; second, there are no clauses regarding employees' labor insurance and welfare benefits; third, the working conditions for employees are not specified; fourth, there are no clear provisions for the responsibilities of both employers and employees in case of a breach of contract. Therefore, when disputes arise between employers and employees in some private enterprises, the signed labor contracts are difficult to use as a basis for arbitration. Moreover, relevant departments find it challenging to protect the legal rights of both employers and employees.

Currently, disputes between employers and employees in some private enterprises are increasing. Some disputes arise because employers dismiss employees without just cause, while others occur because employees leave without notice. For example, the largest private enterprise in our city, Jinxi Zhenxing Mining Company, trained a group of truck drivers from 1983 to 1986. Among them, 12 drivers left without notice, with some working for only a few years and others for just half a year. Employees leaving without notice significantly impacts the enterprise's operations and economic benefits. Due to the lack of a comprehensive labor contract, employers have no way to control these situations. Additionally, when employees are injured at work, the contracts do not specify labor insurance provisions, leaving employers in a difficult position. Some employers have spent a significant amount of money on injured employees, but the employees still have complaints.

Based on the current regulations for private enterprises and the issues present in labor contracts, I propose the following:

1. Private enterprises should handle employee recruitment through local labor departments and sign labor contracts in accordance with relevant regulations.

2. After employers and employees in private enterprises sign contracts, relevant departments should review and certify the legality of the contracts to protect the legal rights of both parties.

3. Various methods should be used to thoroughly propagate national labor policies and regulations to employers and employees, encouraging them to comply with labor laws and policies. Relevant departments should supervise and inspect private enterprises' implementation of labor regulations.

### 搞好私营企业劳动合同的管理

　　搞好私营企业劳动合同的管理
    目前，我市有２１６户私营企业，共有雇工３２２１人，其中最大的一家私营企业有雇工１００多人。在这些私营企业中，只有一小部分雇主与雇工签订了劳动合同。即使这些已经签订的劳动合同，有关内容也不完善。主要存在以下问题：一是没有明确职工工作的质量和数量；二是缺少职工劳动保险和生活福利待遇的条款；三是没有明确职工的劳动条件；四是没有明确雇主与雇工违反劳动合同应承担的责任。因此，一些私营企业的雇主与雇工发生争议时，双方所签订的劳动合同难以作为仲裁的依据。同时，有关部门也难以维护雇主与雇工双方的合法权益。
    现在，一些私人企业的雇主与雇工之间的争议不断增加。有的是因为雇主无故提前辞退雇工，有的是雇工不辞而别。如我市最大的一家私营企业锦西振兴矿业公司，在１９８３年至１９８６年间，花钱培训了一批汽车司机，其中有１２名司机不辞而别，有的干了二三年，有的只干了半年。雇工不辞而别，对企业的经营和经济效益影响很大。由于劳动合同不健全，雇主对这些人也没有制约的办法。另外，一些私营企业的职工出了工伤事故后，由于合同中没有明确有关劳动保险的条款，雇主感到十分为难。有的雇主为受了工伤的职工花了大笔费用，雇工仍有意见。
    根据我国私营企业暂行条例的规定，以及目前私营企业劳动合同中存在的问题，我建议：
    一、私营企业用工应通过当地劳动部门办理用工手续，并按有关规定认真签订劳动合同。
    二、私营企业的雇主与雇工签订合同后，应由有关部门对合同的合法性进行审查和鉴证，以维护雇主与雇工双方的合法权益。
    三、利用各种形式向雇主和雇工认真宣传国家的劳动政策和劳动法规，促使雇主和雇工遵守劳动法规和政策。有关部门应对私营企业执行劳动法规的情况进行监督检查。
