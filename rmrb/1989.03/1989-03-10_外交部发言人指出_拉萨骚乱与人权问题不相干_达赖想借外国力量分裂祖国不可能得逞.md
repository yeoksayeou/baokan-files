Foreign Ministry Spokesperson: Lhasa Riots Unrelated to Human Rights Issues; Dalai Lama's Attempt to Split the Country with Foreign Help Will Fail

New China News Agency, Beijing, March 9th: Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Li Zhaoxing stated today that the Lhasa riots have nothing to do with human rights issues.

The spokesperson made these remarks during an afternoon press conference when answering a reporter's question. The reporter asked, "According to reports, the Dalai Lama recently wrote letters to foreign leaders, asking them to help stop the so-called 'human rights violations' in Tibet. What is your comment on this?"

Li Zhaoxing said, "The Tibet Autonomous Region is an inseparable part of China. The ethnic rights and religious beliefs of the Tibetan people are fully protected by the constitution. Tibet's affairs are China's internal affairs, and no foreign government, organization, or individual has the right to interfere."

The spokesperson pointed out that recently, a few separatist elements in Lhasa engaged in acts of beating, smashing, looting, and burning, deliberately creating riots. These are serious illegal acts aimed at splitting the country, and they have nothing to do with human rights, religion, or ethnic issues. He said, "The Chinese government and people, including the Tibetan people, will not allow anyone to use any pretext to split the country or disrupt national unity. The Dalai clique's attempt to split the country and disrupt national unity with foreign help will not succeed."

When asked by a reporter, "The U.S. State Department spokesperson again issued a statement expressing regret over the 'Lhasa violence' and said that they have contacted China regarding this matter. What is your comment on this?" Li Zhaoxing reiterated that Tibet is an inseparable part of China's territory. Tibet's affairs are not subject to interference by any foreign government, organization, or individual.

　　外交部发言人指出
    拉萨骚乱与人权问题不相干
    达赖想借外国力量分裂祖国不可能得逞
    新华社北京３月９日电  外交部发言人李肇星今天在这里指出，拉萨骚乱与人权问题毫不相干。
    这位发言人是在下午的新闻发布会上答记者问时说这番话的。记者的问题是：“据报道，达赖最近致函外国领导人，请求他们帮助制止在西藏发生的所谓‘侵犯人权的事情’。你对此有何评论？”
    李肇星说，“西藏自治区是中国不可分割的一部分。西藏人民的民族权益和宗教信仰得到宪法的充分保障。西藏事务是中国的内部事务，任何外国政府、组织或个人都无权干涉。”
    这位发言人指出，最近，少数分裂主义分子在拉萨打、砸、抢、烧，蓄意制造骚乱。这是严重违犯法律、旨在分裂祖国的暴力事件，与人权、宗教或民族问题毫不相干。他说，“中国政府和人民，包括西藏人民，绝不允许任何人以任何借口分裂祖国、破坏民族团结。达赖集团想借外国力量分裂祖国、破坏民族团结的企图是不可能得逞的。”
    当有记者问“美国国务院发言人再次发表谈话，对‘拉萨暴力事件’表示遗憾，并称已与中国就此事进行了接触。你对此有何评论”时，李肇星重申，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分。西藏事务不容任何外国政府、组织或个人干涉。
