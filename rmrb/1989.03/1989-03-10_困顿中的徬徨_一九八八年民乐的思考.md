Wandering in Despair
—Reflections on Chinese Folk Music in 1988

	In the Beijing Concert Hall, watching the "National Sixth Music Works Awards" ceremony, I felt a sense of unease. Is this really the state of Chinese folk music creation in 1988? The first prize was vacant, and the second and third prizes were also disappointing.

	Of course, in 1988, Chinese folk music continued to be performed intermittently across the country, with blowing, plucking, and singing. However, many people in the folk music community felt that Chinese folk music was struggling to survive in a state of decline.

	Societal indifference, the stagnation of Chinese folk music itself, and a bit of self-destructive behavior have led people to sigh about the future of Chinese folk music.

	What is the root cause?

	Firstly, there is a misconception about the social impact of Chinese folk music creation and performance, which has caused Chinese folk music to deviate from its cultural position. The social reaction to Chinese folk music creation and performance has always been compared to popular music: the coldness of Chinese folk music seems to be due to the impact of popular music, and it is hoped that Chinese folk music can achieve the sensation of popular music, otherwise, it is considered unpopular. This conceptual confusion has led many people to consciously or unconsciously compare Chinese folk music creation and performance to popular music. In reality, Chinese folk music and popular music are two distinct and incomparable categories or forms of music and culture. Popular music, from composition to lyrics to performance, is permeated with a popular consciousness, making it easy to cause a sensation. Chinese folk music is different; it has its own high standards in technique, which are sometimes difficult to grasp. Although it is constantly innovating, it does not rely on popularity. Its performance requires an elegant environment, a cultural connotation, and a strong musical inner meaning to resonate with the audience. Popular music is suitable for performances in large theaters, stadiums, or even squares with thousands of people, while Chinese folk music needs to be showcased in elegant small theaters or concert halls.

	Therefore, the idea that popular music has impacted Chinese folk music, leading to its decline, is not accurate. Some Chinese folk music audience members have turned to appreciating popular music after its development, which is a reflection of the adjustment of aesthetic tastes and the broad choice of art. Why insist on uniformity! Moreover, Chinese folk music has its own realm, its own audience, and its own value. The value of culture is not determined by the number of appreciators.

	The number of Chinese folk music audience members, of course, cannot surpass that of popular music. But it cannot be denied that Chinese folk music has indeed fallen into a predicament, whether in terms of the quality of works, the system of performance groups, or economic guarantees.

	Chinese folk music creation has not yet broken through in terms of concepts and techniques. The methods are outdated, and the thoughts are rigid, making it difficult to produce brilliant works. Creators and performers complain that the government has lacked necessary protective policies in the past, greatly reducing their economic and social status, making it difficult for them to focus on Chinese folk music. This is not without reason for the stagnation of Chinese folk music. Since Chinese folk music is not a more commercial art, it cannot compete in the cultural market. Therefore, Chinese folk music has the right to receive heavy government and social support; otherwise, it is difficult to maintain. However, heavy support is not enough to solve the problem because those who eat from the "big pot" become lazier. The current art troupe system is bloated and urgently needs reform to make creators and performers have a strong sense of competition and a certain sense of crisis. Otherwise, it will be difficult to maintain vitality.

	Chinese folk music in 1988 is undoubtedly in a state of decline. What about 1989? It is hard to predict. Because reforming the art system and improving the overall environment for art development takes time.

　　困顿中的徬徨
    ——一九八八年民乐的思考
    顾土
    在北京音乐厅里，看着“全国第六届音乐作品评奖”颁奖，心里很不是滋味。难道这就是一九八八年的民乐创作吗？一等奖空缺，二等奖、三等奖又不如人意。
    当然，一九八八年，民乐依旧在全国各地断断续续地演出，吹拉弹唱。但民乐界里许多人却认为民乐是在消沉中艰难度日。
    社会的冷漠，民乐自身的沉寂，外加一点自暴自弃，使人不得不发出民乐出路何在的感叹。
    症结在哪里？
    首先是对民乐创作表演效应的错觉导致民乐偏离了它在文化中的位置。民乐创作表演的社会反应，人们一向以流行音乐为参照系：民乐的冷寂似乎是由于流行音乐的冲击，同时希望民乐能达到流行音乐的轰动效应，否则就是不景气。这种概念上的混乱，使许多人在民乐创作和表演中自觉或不自觉地比照流行音乐。其实，民乐和流行音乐是两种不可也无法攀比的音乐范畴或文化形态。流行音乐从作曲到作词到表演，贯穿着一种普及性的大众意识，容易引起轰动。民乐则不然，在技法上另有自己的高标准，这种标准有时很难把握，尽管也在不断创新，但不会以普及性为依据。它的表演需要优雅的环境，要有一种文化内涵、一种音乐性较强的内在意蕴，才能扣住听众心弦。流行音乐宜于在成千上万人的热热闹闹的大剧场、体育馆甚至广场演出，民乐则需在典雅的小剧场、音乐厅里一展风采。
    所以，流行音乐冲击了民乐导致民乐沉寂的提法是不准确的。一部分民乐听众在流行音乐发展起来以后转而欣赏流行音乐，这是审美情趣的调整，也是艺术上有了广泛选择空间的反映，何必强求一律！而且，民乐自有它的天地，它的听众，它的价值。文化的价值是不以欣赏人数的多寡来论定的。
    民乐的听众人数当然很难超过流行音乐。但也不能不承认，民乐确实陷入了困境，无论作品的质量，表演团体的体制及其经济保障，都是如此。
    民乐创作至今尚未在观念和技法上有所突破。手法陈旧，思想僵固，有光彩的大作自然难产。创作和表演人员抱怨说，政府过去对他们缺少必要的保护政策，使他们的经济地位和社会地位大大降低，无法静下心来从事民乐。这未始不是民乐停滞的一个原因。既然民乐不是商业性较强的艺术，挤不进文化市场竞争，那末，民乐就有理由受到政府和社会的重金养护，否则极难维持。但重金养护仍不足以解决问题，因为吃“大锅饭”的人越吃越懒，现有的文艺团体机构臃肿，亟需进行体制改革，使创作演出人员具有强烈的竞争意识和一定的危机感。不如此便无法保持活力。
    一九八八年的民乐无疑是消沉的，一九八九年如何？尚难预料。因为改革文艺体制、改善文艺发展大环境极需要时间。
