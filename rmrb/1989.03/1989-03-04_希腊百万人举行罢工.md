Xinhua News Agency, Athens, March 2nd.

Approximately one million people across Greece participated in a 24-hour general strike today to protest the government's austerity measures and demand wage increases.

This is the second nationwide strike in Greece in the past month. The strike was initiated and organized by the General Confederation of Greek Workers, with participants from various large enterprises in both the public and private sectors.

According to local television reports tonight, due to the large-scale strike, all banks in Greece were closed today, and public services such as telecommunications, postal services, and electricity were largely paralyzed. Trains and city buses stopped running for part of the day, and hospitals only accepted emergency patients. The Olympic Airlines also had to cancel all domestic and international flights due to its employees participating in the strike.

The Greek government has been implementing austerity measures since October 1985 to manage and improve the economy, strictly controlling the arbitrary increase in wages. After more than three years of effort, Greece's inflation rate has dropped from 25% to 14%. However, because this inflation rate is still significantly higher than the government's regulated wage increase rate, it has caused widespread dissatisfaction among workers and employees, leading to frequent strike waves.

### 希腊百万人举行罢工

　　希腊百万人举行罢工
    新华社雅典３月２日电  希腊全国大约１００万人今天举行２４小时大罢工，抗议政府的经济紧缩政策，要求增加工资。
    这是最近一个月来希腊举行的第二次全国大罢工。罢工是由希腊总工会发起和组织的，参加者包括希腊公共和私营部门各大企业的工人和雇员。
    据当地电视台今晚报道，由于大罢工，希腊全国的银行今天全部关闭，电讯、邮政和电力等公用服务部门基本陷于瘫痪，全国的火车和城市公共汽车在部分时间内停开，医院仅接收危急病人。希腊奥林匹克航空公司也因其雇员参加罢工不得不取消了所有的国内和国际航班。
    希腊政府为治理和改善经济，自１９８５年１０月以来坚持实行经济紧缩政策，严格限制工资的盲目增长。经过３年多努力，希腊的通货膨胀率从２５％下降到了１４％，但因这一通货膨胀率仍与政府规定的工资增长率相差较大，引起广大工人和雇员的不满，造成罢工浪潮频繁。
