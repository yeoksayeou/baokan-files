    Factories and mines should check on domestic electricity use
    In December of last year, the Jiangxi Fengcheng Mining Bureau conducted an inspection of the residential areas, staff dormitories, offices, duty rooms, and machine rooms of its affiliated units for domestic electricity use. They discovered 502 households with illegal electricity use, confiscating and destroying 405 electric stoves and 320 large light bulbs. Despite some individuals pleading with leaders for leniency, the bureau's electricity inspection team adhered to principles and handled matters impartially, confiscating electrical appliances as required and imposing fines where necessary. In just one month, domestic electricity consumption was reduced by over 30,000 kilowatt-hours. Factories and mines should check on domestic electricity use, as it has significant benefits.

    厂矿查一查生活用电有好处
    江西丰城矿务局去年12月对局属单位的居民住宅区、职工宿舍、办公室、值班室、机房等处的生活用电进行检查，发现违章用电户达502户，没收、销毁电炉405只，大灯泡320只，尽管有人找领导同志说情、讨饶，但局用电监察小组坚持原则，秉公办事，该没收电器的予以没收，该罚款的处以罚款。一个月时间，生活用电减少3万多度。厂矿单位查一查生活用电情况，大有好处。
