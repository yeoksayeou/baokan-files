Title: "Entertainment Function" and Other Matters

In the midst of a call for the arrival of a wave of "entertainment films," someone in the press has clearly proposed a function of entertainment films: "Films should not avoid the issue of sex." "Entertainment films mainly provide audiences with a substitute for sexual satisfaction. Viewers use the film to vent their own desires, and audiences pay for tickets essentially to vent their repressed emotions. The question now is to what extent we allow audiences to pay for this desire." Others say, "Films depicting sex should not strive to be completely naked; otherwise, there would be no drama." "Instead, there should be sexual appeal, featuring men and women with prominent sexual characteristics." Some disagree, believing that "it is not necessary to take off clothes to attract audiences, and it is not necessary to depict sex to make money." Others are worried: "People's pursuit of stimulation is endless. If the masses like something, we give it to them. What will be the result?"

As a veteran of the film industry, I am still not clear about the concept of entertainment films being discussed in the film industry and find it difficult to speak out at this moment. For example, why must films be divided into art films and entertainment films? What is the "main body theory of entertainment films," and what is the "main melody"? Does the "entertainment film" being advocated now not have any artistry? Do art films not have entertainment value? Is it impossible for entertainment films to have a main melody? Can the main melody not provide entertainment?

However, as far as I recall, discussing "entertainment films" in such a frank manner, linking "sex," "entertainment function," "repressed desires," "complete nudity," and "making money" together, is unprecedented since the founding of the nation. Moreover, it is said that despite the leadership of the Film Bureau advising and ordering the deletion of certain scenes in some films, many "entertainment films" still include some degree of nudity, partial nudity, and even bedroom scenes.

It is clear that not only is there a theory, but it is also being continuously practiced. This makes me, as an old soldier, a bit worried. Because, if film art (this term seems to have been used less in recent years) links sex and making money, the result will definitely be bad. This can only lead to films following the old path of Western society.

Literature and art depict people's lives, various interpersonal relationships in social reality, and various conflicts—naturally, including repressed desires, thoughts, emotions, and moods, as well as desires, thoughts, emotions, and moods that are not repressed. If this is said to be the function of literature and art, the entertainment effect of literary and artistic works, then the function of literature and art is seen too simply. However, if literature and art are required to satisfy all human desires, whether they should be or should not be, can be obtained or cannot be obtained, to vent this repressed emotion, what kind of art will be produced?

Over the past century, the development of world cinema has proven that various countries have indeed produced many outstanding films with great international influence. However, a large number of vulgar, low-level, and even pornographic films have flooded the market. Even Western critics with a conscience only summarize them with four words: "sex and violence"—in Hong Kong, they are called "bedroom and fist" films. Moreover, they often face criticism from public opinion.

Because, in the Western world, sex and money, beautiful women and a rich life, are not desires that everyone can satisfy—even if they can only be repressed desires. Therefore, to obtain money and beautiful women, one must resort to violence, using violence to obtain money and beautiful women. Thus, from thieves, swindlers, various murderers, rapists, human trafficking gangs, smuggling gangs, financial groups, high-ranking officials and big businessmen, international spies, soldiers and officers, reporters and stars... all are involved in the struggle for money and beautiful women, even resorting to all kinds of cruel means and methods to obtain these opportunities and conditions to enjoy this satisfaction. This is the "sex and violence" tide that Western commercial films keep changing but never deviate from their essence! This is also the fundamental reason why they constantly promote one sex symbol after another.

Do we need Chinese films to join this old trend? To put it more frankly, do Chinese films need to participate in this "sex and violence" competition?

I think that if entertainment films focus on the "sex" aspect, there is no way out. I hope that sincere artists do not need to consider: "To what extent do we allow audiences to pay for this desire?"

I saw a piece of news in the latest issue of "China Film Weekly" and couldn't help but feel a bit embarrassed:

"Professor Brown of the University of California Film Department and Professor Ji Bosi, Director of the Sociology Department, expressed regret that Chinese film production lacks money to shoot art films and has to shoot a large number of entertainment films. They said that in the United States, they conducted a survey that during a period when violent and pornographic films were broadcast, the crime rate in that period clearly rose."

I have met Professor Brown in the United States and in China. He is a good friend who has come to China many times to teach and enthusiastically studies and introduces Chinese film art. He is now actively raising funds to prepare for a Chinese film research and discussion conference in the United States in 1990. I don't know how he got the impression that we lack money to shoot art films.

Is it really that poor?

And even poor enough to depict sex to make money?

I thought of this and couldn't help but feel embarrassed.

　　“娱乐功能”及其他
     荒煤
    在一片呼唤电影“娱乐片”大潮来临的时候，有人在报刊上对娱乐片的一种功能明确提出：“电影不应回避性的问题”。而“娱乐片主要给观众以替代式的性满足，观影者借影片宣泄自己的欲望，观众花钱买票实际上买的是宣泄自己被压抑的情绪，现在问题是我们在多大程度上容许观众付钱买这种欲望。”还有人说：“电影表现性，不应争取脱的程度，脱得一丝不挂就没有戏了”；“而应有性感，表现有突出性感特征的男性和女性。”也有人不同意，认为，“不一定脱衣服才能吸引观众，不一定表现性才能赚钱”；还有人担忧：“人追求刺激无止境，如大众喜欢什么就给什么。结果如何？”
    我作为一个电影战线上的退伍老兵，对电影界正在讨论的娱乐片的概念还弄不太清楚，一时还难以发言：例如为什么一定要把影片分为艺术片、娱乐片；什么叫做“娱乐片主体论”，什么才是“主旋律”？难道现在倡导的“娱乐片”都不是艺术？艺术片就没有娱乐性？娱乐片中不可能有主旋律？主旋律中不能给人娱乐？
    但就我记忆所及，讨论“娱乐片”如此坦率地把“性”和“娱乐功能”、“被压抑的欲望”、“脱得一丝不挂”、“赚钱”等等联在一起谈，倒是建国以来破天荒的第一次。而且听说，尽管电影局有关领导方面对某些影片劝说、下令删剪某些镜头，还有不少“娱乐片”总要或多或少来点裸体、半裸体以至床上镜头。
    可见，不仅是有理论，也在不断实践了。这就不免让我这个老兵有点担忧。因为，电影艺术（这些年来，电影艺术这个名词似乎都少用了）如果把性和赚钱联系起来考虑，结果肯定是不妙的。这只能导致电影走西方社会影视的老路。
    文艺表现人的生活，表现社会现实生活中的各种人际关系，以及各种矛盾，都不能不表现人的欲望、思想、情感和情绪——自然，既有被压抑的欲望、思想、情感和情绪，也有不受压抑的欲望、思想、情感和情绪。如果说这就是文艺的功能，文艺作品的娱乐作用，也未免把文学艺术的功能看得太简单了。可是，如果要求通过文艺作品去满足人们的所有的欲望，不论是应该有的或不应有的，能够得到的或不能得到的，去宣泄这种被压抑的情感，那会产生什么样的艺术？
    近一个世纪以来，世界电影艺术发展的道路证明，各个国家的确不断产生了有巨大国际影响的许多优秀影片，然而大量的庸俗低级甚至色情的影片泛滥成灾，即使西方有良知的评论家也只以四个字“性与暴力”加以概括否定——在香港就叫做“床头拳头”片。而且往往受到社会舆论的谴责。
    因为，性与金钱，美女与富裕生活，在西方世界也不可能是人人都可以获得满足的欲望——甚至也只能是被压抑的欲望，那么，为了获得金钱美女，只得诉之于暴力，用暴力来取得金钱与美女，于是从小偷、骗子、各种杀人犯、强奸犯、贩卖妇女集团、走私集团、财团、高级官员和大企业家、国际间谍、士兵与军官、记者与明星……无不卷入金钱美女的搏斗之中，甚至不惜使用一切残酷手段和方法来获取这种种机遇和条件以享受这种满足。这就是西方商业片千变万化，万变不离其宗的“性与暴力”的大潮！这也就是他们无时无刻尽一切可能捧出一个又一个性感明星的根本原因。
    难道中国电影也需要加入这种老潮流？说得更坦率一些，中国电影需要参加这种“性和暴力”的竞赛么？
    我看，要娱乐片在“性”字上作文章，是没有出路的。我希望真诚的艺术家不必考虑：“我们在多大程度上容许观众付钱来满足这种欲望”了。
    我看到最近一期《中国电影周报》的一段消息不免有点脸红：
    “美国加州大学电影系教授布朗，社会学系主任季博思对中国电影制作业无钱拍艺术片，不得不大量拍摄娱乐片表示惋惜，他们说在美国作过调查，一个时期影视播放的暴力色情片，这个时期犯罪率就明显上升。”
    我在美国和国内都会晤过布朗教授，是一位多次来华讲学，热情研究、介绍中国电影艺术的我们的好朋友，现在正在积极奔走筹资准备在１９９０年在美国举行一个中国电影的研究讨论会。我不知道他怎么会得到这个印象：我们无钱拍艺术片。
    果然是穷到这种地步了么？
    而且还穷到要表现性感来赚钱？
    我想到此，不能不脸红。
