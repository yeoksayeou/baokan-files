Benazir Bhutto took office as the Prime Minister of Pakistan on December 2, 1988, and formed a new cabinet on December 4. It has been exactly 100 days since then. Many people have been closely watching how this young leader will guide this Muslim nation of over 100 million people.

Upon taking office, the People's Party government immediately announced the release of political prisoners, the pardon of some elderly and female criminal offenders; the restoration of trade union and university student union activities; the restoration of press and publication freedoms; the abolition of the list of personnel controls drawn up by the previous government; and the allowance for opposition parties to use the media. This enabled tens of thousands of political prisoners to reunite with their families and participate in social activities. Those who fled abroad during martial law also returned to the country. With the restoration of trade union and student union activities, channels for expressing public opinion have been established, and social order has gradually improved. Newspapers have opened up their columns for criticism of the government, and articles critical of the government frequently appear in the press. The activities of opposition parties appearing on television screens is a first in Pakistan's history. The vast majority of Pakistanis, especially those in the legal and media professions, are delighted that their country has returned to democracy. In these 100 days, there have been strikes, shutdowns, and protests, and some major cities have even experienced unrest, but the government has not suppressed the opposition parties and has not arrested a single political prisoner.

After taking office, Benazir Bhutto quickly began her diplomatic activities. At the end of last year, Pakistan, as the host country, convened the fourth summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, where the two young prime ministers of India and Pakistan met for the first time and created a good beginning for improving relations between the two countries. At the start of the new year, Benazir Bhutto first went to Mecca for the Hajj, followed by an official visit to China, further developing the traditional friendship between the two countries. Later, she attended the funeral of the Japanese emperor in Tokyo and met with foreign leaders such as U.S. President Bush. Domestically, Benazir Bhutto received visits from important leaders such as the Turkish president, the Australian prime minister, PLO leader Arafat, and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze. People have called this period an active time for Pakistani diplomacy.

The new government also faces serious challenges, mainly economic ones. Last year, Pakistan experienced a series of natural disasters and man-made calamities. The province of Punjab, known as the "granary," suffered severe flooding, resulting in poor harvests. The government had to import grain to increase reserves. In addition, the country spent a large amount of money on elections last year, and the People's Party government faced serious financial difficulties upon taking office. It borrowed $1 billion from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund for emergency use and accepted the two organizations' harsh requirements to "increase domestic tax revenues to improve repayment capacity." Due to the increase in sales tax, prices have risen significantly, and the annual inflation rate has risen from around 5% to over 10%. However, the prices of daily necessities such as milk, bread, sugar, and flour have remained the same, while high-end consumer goods have seen noticeable price increases. The government advocates encouraging the development of private enterprises, no longer increasing state-owned enterprises, and quickly solving problems related to people's unemployment, housing, education, and medical care. These policies are in line with Pakistan's national conditions and are deeply welcomed by the people, but it will take time to implement these policies. Another challenge facing the People's Party government comes from the powerful opposition party. In last year's elections, the main opposition party, the Muslim League, won in the largest province of Punjab, and the provincial government formed by this league often plays a counter-role to the federal government. Although Benazir Bhutto has made some efforts, the conflict has not been resolved to this day. It seems that more time is needed.

　　贝·布托执政一百天
    本报记者  任毓骏
    贝·布托于去年１２月２日就任巴基斯坦总理，１２月４日组成新内阁，至今已整整１００天。许多人一直在关注着这位年轻的政府首脑如何领导这个１亿多人口的穆斯林大国。
    人民党政府一上台，就宣布释放政治犯，赦免一些年老体弱和妇女刑事犯；恢复工会和大学学生会活动；恢复新闻出版自由；废止上届政府开列的人员控制名单；允许反对党使用新闻媒介。这使成千上万的政治犯得以和家人团聚并参加社会活动，军管期间逃亡国外的人士也纷纷回国。工会和学生会活动恢复后，有了表达民意的渠道，社会治安逐渐好转。报纸言论开放，批评政府的文章常见诸报端。反对党派的活动能出现在电视屏幕上是巴基斯坦历史上从未有过的。绝大多数巴基斯坦人，特别是法律界和新闻界人士，为他们的国家恢复了民主而感到高兴，在这１００天中，虽也发生过罢工、罢市、游行示威，一些大城市甚至发生过动乱，但政府没有压制反对党，没有抓一个政治犯。
    贝·布托就职后很快开始了外交活动。去年底，巴基斯坦作为东道国召开了第四届南亚区域合作联盟首脑会议，印巴两位年轻总理首次见面并为改善两国关系开创了良好的开端。新年伊始，贝·布托先去麦加朝觐，接着就正式访华，发展了中巴两国间的传统友谊。此后她赴东京参加日本天皇的葬礼，同美国总统布什等外国领导人会晤。在国内，贝·布托接待了土耳其总统、澳大利亚总理、巴解领导人阿拉法特和苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽等重要领导人来访。人们称这一段时间是巴基斯坦外交上的活跃时期。
    新政府也面临严重的挑战，这主要是经济问题。去年巴基斯坦天灾人祸接连发生，号称“粮仓”的旁遮普省发生严重水灾，粮食歉收，政府不得不进口粮食以增加储备。再加上去年国家耗费巨资举行大选，人民党政府一上台就面临严重财政困难，向世界银行和国际货币基金组织借贷１０亿美元应急，并且接受了这两个组织提出的“增加国内税收以改善还债能力的”苛刻要求。由于提高了销售税，物价明显上涨，通货膨胀年率从以前的５％左右上升到１０％以上。但消费者每天必购的牛奶、面包、糖、面粉等始终保持原价，明显涨价的是高档消费品。政府主张鼓励私营企业发展，不再增加国有化企业，并要加速解决人民失业、住房、教育、医疗等问题，这些政策符合巴基斯坦国情，也深受人民欢迎，但兑现这些政策须待以时日。人民党政府面临的另一个挑战来自强大的反对党。在去年大选中，主要的反对党伊民盟在最大的省份旁遮普获胜，该盟组建的省政府不时和联邦政府唱对台戏。尽管贝·布托作了一些努力，直到目前矛盾仍未解决。看来，尚需时日。
    外界评论说，贝·布托就任总理１００天，“没有创造奇迹，也没有失误。”她的政坛生涯才刚刚开始。
