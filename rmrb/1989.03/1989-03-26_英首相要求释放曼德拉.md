British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on March 24 that if the South African authorities do not release African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, she will not visit South Africa.

Thatcher made the remarks during an interview with a BBC reporter. She said that speculation about her visit to South Africa is groundless.

Thatcher will begin a week-long tour of Africa on March 27, visiting Morocco, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and Malawi.

She also reiterated that although she has called for Mandela's release, she will not hold talks with the African National Congress.

　　英首相要求释放曼德拉
    新华社伦敦３月２４日电  英国首相撒切尔夫人２４日说，如果南非当局不释放非洲人国民大会领导人纳尔逊·曼德拉，她就不访问南非。
    撒切尔夫人是在接受英国广播公司记者采访时作出上述表示的。她说，有关她将去南非访问的猜测毫无根据。
    撒切尔夫人将于２７日开始为期一周的非洲之行，她将访问摩洛哥、尼日利亚、津巴布韦和马拉维。
    他还重申，尽管她呼吁释放曼德拉，但她不会同非洲人国民大会举行会谈。
