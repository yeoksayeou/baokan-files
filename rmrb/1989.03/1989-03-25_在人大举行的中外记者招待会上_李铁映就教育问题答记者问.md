Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 25th

On the afternoon of March 24, Li Tieying, the Minister of the State Education Commission, along with his deputies He Dongchang and Zhu Kaixuan, attended a press conference on education held by the National People's Congress for both Chinese and foreign journalists. After He Dongchang introduced the basic situation, journalists from both China and abroad began to ask questions.

China Education News reporter: Chairman Deng Xiaoping mentioned yesterday during a meeting with foreign guests that the biggest mistake in the past decade was the insufficient development of education. How should we understand this? What measures will the State Education Commission take to develop and revitalize the education sector?

Li Tieying: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks are accurate and correct, and they provide a proper summary of the past decade of reform and construction. The backward state of education can no longer meet the needs of the reform situation and fails to satisfy the learning aspirations of the broad masses of young people. Currently, China has 220 million illiterates. Among young students, one-third have only received primary education, another third have only received junior high school education, and less than 30% have received senior high school education. The national average years of education received is less than five years. The low national quality and educational level have become important constraints on our modernization and reform. Although education has developed over the past decade, overall, the backward state of education has not changed, and many major educational problems have not been properly addressed. This is our understanding. As for measures and strategies, last year's two sessions proposed many beneficial criticisms and suggestions regarding the development and reform of education, as well as the existing problems. The Politburo of the Central Committee has tasked the State Council with conducting a systematic study of major educational issues. Recently, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China will also discuss major issues regarding the development and reform of education.

Asahi Shimbun reporter from Japan: Apart from the "Compulsory Education Law," what other educational regulations is China planning to formulate?

Li Tieying: In recent years, we have been studying various laws, regulations, and rules related to education and plan to draft the Basic Education Law, Teacher's Law, Vocational and Technical Regulations, and the Protection of Minors Regulations. Our educational legal system is still very incomplete. We need to make education legalized, governed by law, and promoted by law.

People's Daily reporter: What are the fundamental reasons for the significant mistakes in education over the past decade? What responsibilities should the State Education Commission bear?

Li Tieying: The insufficient development of education is due to various factors, including economic and systemic issues. The most important factor is the lack of emphasis and low level of recognition. The State Education Commission was established in 1985. Before 1985, the Ministry of Education mainly managed school education. Many problems cannot be solely resolved by the education sector; they involve various aspects, especially systemic issues, which require coordinated reforms. Of course, the Commission has also had shortcomings in organizing and implementing the policies of the Central Committee and the State Council, serving as the State Council's advisor and assistant, and organizing the reform of national education. We have noticed this problem and have drafted a comprehensive development and reform outline, which we plan to submit to the State Council for discussion.

Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporter: Considering the significant mistakes in education, it seems that some responsibilities should be borne by certain leaders. Are you, Mr. Li Tieying, willing to take responsibility for this?

Li Tieying: The Central Committee and the State Council practice collective leadership. Although I have been in charge of educational work for only one year, I am willing to say that I bear responsibility for this issue.

He Dongchang interjected: Comrade Deng Xiaoping's remarks yesterday about educational issues are very good news for the educational community.

Hong Kong's "Xin Wanbao" reporter: Over the past decade of reform, every year it has been said that education is important, but every year the education budget has been insufficient. Does this indicate that the State Education Commission is ineffective?

Li Tieying: Due to the large scale, low level, poor foundation, and significant debts of our education system, insufficient funding is a long-term issue. We are a developing country, and relying solely on a significant increase in government education funding is not enough. We need to start with reforms, reforming the education system and school management system, and solving the problem of multi-channel funding for education.

China Times reporter from Taiwan: In the past, there were incidents of encouraging students to submit blank exam papers. Are there still such "leftist" interferences now? If so, how serious are they?

He Dongchang: During the Cultural Revolution, the Gang of Four proposed that the more one reads, the more reactionary one becomes. Currently, there are some college students with low learning enthusiasm, which is true. However, the situation varies among different schools. For example, at Beihang University, 83% of students read more than 50 hours per week.

Guangming Daily reporter: In the past, we have repeatedly mentioned the increase in education funding, but according to relevant data, China's per capita education funding is only $11.2, ranking second to last in the world. Now, the new "education is useless" theory is prevalent. Is this because education is devalued? How can we reverse this situation?

He Dongchang: The learning enthusiasm of college students is affected by the unfair distribution in society, including the treatment of teachers. The Central Committee and the State Council are currently taking measures to study and solve the problem of the treatment of intellectuals. We also need to reform the educational work within schools to make schools attractive to students.

　　在人大举行的中外记者招待会上        
    李铁映就教育问题答记者问
    三月二十四日下午，国家教委主任李铁映和副主任何东昌、朱开轩出席了全国人大举行的教育专题的中外记者招待会。在何东昌介绍了基本情况之后，中外记者开始提问。
    中国教育报记者：邓小平主席昨天会见外宾时说，十年间最大的失误是教育方面发展不够，这应如何理解？教委将采取什么措施发展和振兴教育事业？
    李铁映：邓小平同志的话是准确的、正确的，是对十年改革和建设的正确总结。教育落后已不能适应改革的形势，不能满足广大青少年的求学需要。现在中国有两亿二千万文盲，在青少年学生中，仅受小学教育的占三分之一，受初中教育的占三分之一，能受高中教育的不足百分之三十，全国人均受教育年限不足五年。民族素质差、教育水平低已成为我国现代化建设和改革的重要制约。虽然十年来教育事业有所发展，但总的来说，教育的落后状态没有改变，教育的许多重大问题没有解决好。这是我们的理解。至于措施和对策，去年两会对教育的发展、改革以及存在的问题提出了许多有益的批评和建议，中央政治局责成国务院对教育的重大问题进行系统研究。最近，中共中央还要就教育的发展和改革的重大问题进行讨论。
    日本朝日新闻记者：中国除了《义务教育法》以外，还准备制定哪些有关教育的法规？
    李铁映：我们这几年正在研究有关教育的各种法律、法规和条例，准备制订教育基本法通则、教师法、职业技术条例、未成年人的保护条例。我们的教育立法体系还很不完备，要使我们的教育今后走向法制化，以法治教、以法促教。
    人民日报记者：十年中教育发生那么大的失误，请问根本原因何在？国家教委应负什么样的责任？
    李铁映：教育发展不够，原因是多方面的。有经济方面、体制方面的问题。重要的是重视不够、认识不高。国家教委是一九八五年成立的。一九八五年以前教育部主要管理学校教育方面。许多问题不完全是教育部门所能单独解决的，涉及到各个方面，特别是体制方面，需要配套改革。当然，教委在组织落实、贯彻中央和国务院的方针以及做好国务院的参谋和助手，组织发展全国教育的改革等方面也是有缺点的。我们已注意到这个问题，制订了全面发展和改革的纲要，准备提交国务院讨论。
    澳大利亚广播公司记者：考虑到在教育方面的重大失误，似乎有些责任是应由一些领导人担当的，李铁映先生您本人是否愿意为此承担责任？
    李铁映：我们中央和国务院是实行集体领导的。虽然我主持教育工作只有一年，但是我愿意说，在这个问题上我有责任。
    何东昌插话：邓小平同志昨天关于教育问题的谈话对教育界是个非常好的消息。
    香港《新晚报》记者：改革十年来每年都说重视教育，但教育经费每年都不够，这是否表明教委办事不力？
    李铁映：由于我们教育规模大、水平低、基础差、欠帐多，经费不足是个较长时期的问题。我们是发展中国家，要靠大幅度提高政府的教育拨款是不够的。要从改革入手，改革教育体制、办学体制，解决教育经费的多渠道筹集问题。
    台湾《中国时报》记者：过去发生过鼓励交白卷的事，请问现在还有没有这类来自“左”的干扰？如果有，严重不严重？
    何东昌：文革中提出读书越多越反动，是四人帮提出来的。现在有少数大学生学习积极性不高，是有的。但各校情况不一样。比如北航，每周读书五十小时以上的学生占百分之八十三。
    《光明日报》记者：过去我们多次提到教育经费增加，但从有关资料得知，我国人均教育经费仅十一点二美元，是世界倒数第二。现在新的读书无用论泛滥，是因为教育贬值，请问如何扭转这一局面？
    何东昌：大学生学习积极性受影响，跟社会分配不公有关，包括教师待遇。中央和国务院正在采取措施研究解决知识分子待遇问题。我们也要改革学校内部的教育工作，使学校对学生有吸引力。
