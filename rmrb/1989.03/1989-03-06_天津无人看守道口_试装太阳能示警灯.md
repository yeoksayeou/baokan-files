Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 5th.

Unattended railroad crossings in Tianjin have recently been equipped with solar-powered photoelectric warning lights. These crossings, where there is no human supervision, are high-risk areas for collisions between vehicles, tractors, pedestrians, and trains. Just this year, Tianjin has already seen five such incidents, resulting in nine deaths.

The successful trial of this equipment by the China Railway Materials Corporation and the Tianjin Railway Bureau will be promoted nationwide.
