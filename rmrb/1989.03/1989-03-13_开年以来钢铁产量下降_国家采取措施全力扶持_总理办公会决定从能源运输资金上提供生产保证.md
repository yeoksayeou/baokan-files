The metallurgical industry, which has achieved an annual increase of 300 million tons of steel for five consecutive years, has encountered relatively serious difficulties this year. Steel production has shown a downward trend since the beginning of the year. The State Council leadership has paid great attention to this issue, analyzing the steel production situation multiple times and studying solutions to the problems.

Li Peng, the Premier, recently chaired a meeting of the Premier's Office, during which he listened to a report from the Minister of Metallurgical Industry, Qie Yuanjing, on the steel production situation. The meeting decided that the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Energy, the People's Bank of China, and the China Coal Company should take measures in terms of coal, electricity, transportation, and funds to ensure the necessary conditions for steel production, especially to guarantee the production of key state-owned steel enterprises. The meeting also decided to arrange some working capital loans for steel enterprises to address urgent needs. Li Peng emphasized that steel enterprises should save energy, reduce consumption, use more scrap steel, and improve the yield rate. The priority is to increase the production of steel, especially the short-supply varieties of steel. After the meeting, Minister Qie Yuanjing went to Anshan Steel to mobilize all employees to boost their spirits, overcome difficulties, and strive to increase steel production.

In the face of tight coal and electricity supply, the broad masses of workers in steel enterprises, in order to share the country's difficulties and contribute to the rectification and adjustment, have been proactive and striving forward. Workers at Anshan Steel have loudly proclaimed the slogan: "No complaints, more work, more ideas, better work." They have also proposed specific measures to absorb external price increases. Since the beginning of this year, Anshan Steel has made significant achievements in excavating scrap steel, cleaning coal residues, and saving electricity. Fushun Steel Plant has developed new products that are urgently needed in the market, adjusted the product structure, and relied on technological progress to reduce costs and save expenses. Despite the severe shortage of electricity, raw materials, and funds, the workers and management of Shanggang Steel Plant have united to overcome difficulties, focusing on increasing efficiency and tapping potential, and have achieved good results in reducing production and increasing income. In the first two months, despite the overall reduction in steel production in the industry, some short-supply steel products such as thin plates, seamless steel pipes, strip steel, and light rails have increased compared to the same period last year.

Currently, the steel production situation has begun to improve. The average daily steel production in February was higher than in January, and in the first ten days of March, it further improved compared to February. However, it has not yet reached the level of the same period last year and is still some distance from the state's planned requirements. The broad masses of steel workers have expressed their determination to do a good job in their own work and to do everything possible to complete this year's steel production plan.

　　开年以来钢铁产量下降  国家采取措施全力扶持
    总理办公会决定从能源运输资金上提供生产保证
    新华社北京３月１２日电  已连续五年实现年增产钢３００万吨的冶金工业，今年一开年就遇到了比较严重的困难，钢铁产量出现下降趋势。国务院领导对此十分关注，多次分析钢铁生产形势，研究解决问题的办法。
    李鹏总理最近主持总理办公会议，听取了冶金工业部长戚元靖关于钢铁生产情况的汇报，并研究决定，由国家计委、铁道部、能源部、中国人民银行、中煤公司等部门从煤炭、电力、运输、资金等方面采取措施，重点保证钢铁生产的必要条件，特别是要保国家重点钢铁企业的生产。会议还决定，为钢铁企业挤出一些流动资金贷款，以解燃眉之急。李鹏同志要求钢铁企业节约能源，降低消耗，多吃废钢，提高成材率，首先要把钢材特别是把短缺品种的钢材抓上去。会后戚元靖部长深入鞍钢，动员全体职工振奋精神，克服困难，努力增加钢铁生产。
    面对煤电供应紧张的局面，钢铁企业广大职工为了分担国家的困难，为治理整顿出力，积极主动，拚搏前进。鞍钢工人响亮地喊出：“不发牢骚多干活，多出主意干好活”的口号，还具体提出了消化外部涨价因素的措施。今年以来，鞍钢在挖掘废钢、清理煤底、节约电力等方面取得了较大成绩。抚顺钢厂通过开发市场急需的新品种，调整了产品结构，并依靠技术进步，降低了成本，节约了开支。在电力严重不足、原辅材料紧缺、资金匮乏的冲击面前，上钢五厂广大职工和企业同命运，他们“眼睛向内增效益，手心向下挖潜力，和衷共济渡难关”，也取得了减产增收的好成绩。一二月份冶金工业在全行业钢产量减少的情况下，一些短缺品种钢材如薄板、无缝钢管、带钢、轻轨等产品比去年同期还有增长。
    目前，钢铁生产形势开始有所好转，二月份钢的平均日产量比一月份有所增长，三月上旬比二月份又有进一步好转，但还未达到去年同期水平，离国家计划的要求仍然有一定距离。广大钢铁职工表示，要进一步做好自身工作，千方百计完成今年钢铁生产的国家计划。
