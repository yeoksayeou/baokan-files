“Blind Flow,” a Signal

Zhū Shìlóng

“Blind Flow,” seems like a demon released from a bottle, has been troubling China. Hundreds of thousands of men and women seeking work have surged into Guangzhou, flowed towards Xinjiang, rushed to the Northeast, and many have also come to Beijing. Different regional accents blend into this torrent, causing a series of chain reactions and social problems. The already tense railway transportation is even more overburdened, with the crowded trains reminding one of the “unprecedented” and “great link-up” scenes.

However, this time it is not a free trip, and this “blind flow” is different from the long-lost “blind flow” that aimed at wandering and begging. Previously, many “blind flow” individuals carried begging permits issued by local authorities, while now many carry job-seeking permits issued by local authorities. Inter-provincial “labor export” has long been acknowledged by society. This “labor export” is different from the various service-oriented craftsmen's mobility that has long existed. Many people do not have their own labor tools; they only have labor power. Therefore, the current “blind flow” is a massive “reserve army of labor power.” The disturbances caused by the “blind flow” in society reflect the restlessness of this increasingly powerful “reserve army of labor power.” This is a signal that deserves attention.

Analyzing the reasons why this problem has suddenly become acute, we can see that it is not something that can be resolved in a short period. Ten years of rural reforms and the development of rural productivity have freed more and more labor from the land. In some places, the implementation of “appropriate scale” operations has led even more farmers to seek new production paths. The economic overheating of recent years, the large number of non-planned projects and non-planned employment, have further stimulated millions of farmers to join the urban influx. Currently, the state advocates curbing economic overheating and reducing construction scale, and this ever-increasing urban influx encounters a suddenly narrowed channel, how can it not overflow?

If the “Great Link-up” during the “Cultural Revolution” reflected the students' political fervor and naivety, then this time it reflects the farmers' normal economic demands.

Therefore, the fundamental solution to the so-called “blind flow” lies in finding an outlet for these labor forces. If they are not transformed into productive forces for society, they can easily become a destructive force. Making farmers return to the old method of sharing a bowl of rice is not feasible. The increasingly severe reality poses new problems for urban and rural industrial development. This ever-increasing reserve army of labor provides favorable conditions for the development of new industries. In addition to opening up new production paths and increasing employment opportunities, establishing labor markets and improving management, strengthening employment guidance, and reducing the blindness of personnel movement are urgent tasks. Because of the increase in “blind flow,” some existing labor markets should not be abolished, but rather, the exchange of information between local labor markets should be strengthened, appropriate employment methods should be formulated, and thus unnecessary social waste should be reduced.

　　“盲流”，一个信号
    朱世龙
    “盲流”，仿佛是瓶子里放出来的妖魔一样，困扰着中国，几十万寻找工作的男男女女的洪流涌进广州、流向新疆、奔向东北，也有不少来到北京。不同的乡音汇进了这股洪流，引起了一系列的连锁反应和社会问题。本来就紧张的铁路运输更是不堪重负，列车之拥挤使人想起“史无前例”“大串联”的“盛况”。
    然而这一次并不是免费的旅行，而且这一次“盲流”与久违多年的以流浪乞食为目的的“盲流”不同。以前的“盲流”人员，不少是手持当地有关部门开出的乞讨证明，现今很多是手持当地有关部门开出的找工作的证明。省际之间的“劳务输出”，早已得到社会的承认。这次“劳务输出”又有别于早已存在的各种服务性的工匠的流动，很多人没有自己的劳动工具，他们有的只是劳动力。所以说，现今的“盲流”，是一支庞大的生产性“劳动力的后备军”，“盲流”在社会上所引起的困扰，显示了这支日益壮大起来的“劳动力后备军”的躁动不安。这是一个值得重视的信号。
    分析一下这一问题在目前突然尖锐起来的原因，可以看出这个问题不是短时期内能消除的。十年的农村改革，农村生产力的发展，使得越来越多的劳动力从土地上解放出来，一些地方搞的“适度规模”经营，又使更多的农民寻找新的生产门路。这几年经济过热的现象，大量计划外的项目和计划外的用工，更刺激了千千万万的农民加入了进军城市的洪流。当前，国家提出抑制经济过热，压缩基建规模，这不断增大的进城洪流，就遇上了突然狭小起来的河道，怎么能不四溢呢？
    如果说，“文化革命”的大串联表现了学生政治上的狂热和幼稚，那么这一次，则表现了农民经济上的正常要求。
    所以，解决所谓“盲流”的根本办法在于给这些劳动力找到出路。如果不将其变为社会生产力，就很容易变为一种社会的破坏力量。让农民重新回到过去那种一碗饭大家匀着吃的老办法是行不通的。日益严峻的现实向我们提出了城乡产业开发的新问题。这支日益增大的劳动力后备军，则为新的产业开发提供了有利的条件。除了开发新的生产门路，增加就业机会外，建立劳务市场和健全管理，加强就业的指导，尽可能地减少人员流动的盲目性，是当务之急。不能因为“盲流”增多，就取消一些早已存在的劳务市场，而是应该加强各地劳务市场之间的信息往来，制订相应的用工办法，从而减少不必要的社会浪费。
