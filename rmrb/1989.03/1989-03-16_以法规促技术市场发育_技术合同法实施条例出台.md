Promoting the Development of the Technology Market through Regulations: The Implementation of the Technology Contract Law

The State Science and Technology Commission today issued the "Implementation Regulations of the Technology Contract Law of the People's Republic of China," which was approved by the State Council. The implementation of these regulations marks the basic completion of China's legal system regarding technology contracts.

It is understood that in 1987, the total market transaction volume of technology contracts nationwide reached 3.35 billion yuan, and in 1988, it reached 7 billion yuan. The "Technology Contract Law" was implemented in November 1987, but because the provisions in the law are relatively general, many disputes could not be resolved promptly and clearly.

The "Regulations" consist of 9 chapters and 134 articles. They not only provide a comprehensive, detailed, and clear interpretation of some of the provisions and terms in the "Technology Contract Law," but also supplement the law in response to new situations and issues that have arisen during its implementation. They clarify several important norms. To resolve disputes in technology contracts through negotiation, the State Science and Technology Commission is considering the establishment of an arbitration body for technology contracts.

　　以法规促技术市场发育
    技术合同法实施条例出台
    本报北京３月１５日讯  记者陈祖甲报道：国家科委今天发布了经国务院批准的《中华人民共和国技术合同法实施条例》。条例的施行，标志我国有关技术合同的法律制度已基本完善。
    据了解，１９８７年，全国通过技术合同的市场交易额达到３３．５亿元，１９８８年为７０亿元。１９８７年１１月实施了《技术合同法》，由于其中的条文比较原则，许多纠纷得不到及时明确的解决。
    《条例》分９章１３４条，不仅对《技术合同法》一些条文和用语作了全面、详尽和明确的解释，而且针对合同法执行中出现的新情况、新问题，对合同法作了补充，明确了一些重要的规范。为了协商解决技术合同中的争议问题，国家科委正在酝酿成立技术合同的仲裁机构。
