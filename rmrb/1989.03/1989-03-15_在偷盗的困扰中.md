In recent years, some enterprises and construction projects have often been plagued by thieves, causing serious losses to state and collective property. The Linfen Steel Company in Shanxi Province is a prime example. Recently, based on the situation reflected in letters from readers, a reporter from this newspaper went to the Linfen Steel Company and the surrounding villages to conduct an investigation.

Theft and Robbery Rampant

Linfen Steel (Linsteel) is one of the four major steel enterprises in Shanxi Province, located on the outskirts of Linfen City, covering an area of 3.5 square kilometers. The company's fixed assets are approximately 174 million yuan, and it generates over 20 million yuan in profits for the state each year. The pig iron and other products it produces are high-quality products of the Ministry of Metallurgy, attracting the attention of the people of Sanjin.

Linsteel's large-scale operations have also attracted the attention of those eager to make money and lawless elements. In recent years, incidents of villagers from nearby villages stealing iron and steel materials from Linsteel have become increasingly frequent. Initially, some villagers would steal piece by piece, packing iron blocks into lunch boxes, ice cream boxes, and chamber pots, or wrapping them in cotton coats and quilts and carrying them out on bicycles. Some women even stuffed iron blocks into their clothes to take them out. Later, it developed into stealing by the carload and ton, using handcarts and small four-wheel tractors, and even forming groups of dozens or hundreds of people to loot.

On the evening of November 26, 1988, Linsteel's economic police discovered a four-wheel tractor loaded with coke powder moving with difficulty at the slag station. Upon inspection, it was found that the coke powder was a cover, and the tractor was loaded with a full car of stolen pig iron, weighing 4.75 tons. Three thieves admitted that just a few minutes earlier, their accomplices had stolen 5.3 tons of pig iron from Linsteel's iron warehouse using a four-wheel tractor and sold it directly to the Linfen City Materials Trading and Transportation Company. After Linsteel Public Security Bureau investigated and filed a case, following this lead, they uncovered that Ma Xuping and 16 others had stolen a total of 44.438 tons of pig iron and mixed iron from Linsteel's iron warehouse, North Goods Yard, and casting machine over eight times in two months, valued at over 23,000 yuan.

Even more brazen, some villagers openly looted. In mid-August of last year alone, there were four incidents of over a hundred villagers looting a special train carrying iron, stealing over 30 tons of pig iron. On the evening of January 13 this year, over 40 villagers from Shuimen Street rushed to two freight cars loaded with pig iron at the Linsteel transfer station, ignoring the police's warnings and looting recklessly. The economic police managed to retrieve over 500 kilograms of pig iron from the scene.

These thefts and lootings have caused serious losses to Linsteel. According to a rough survey by Linsteel's economic police squad in November last year, the company loses pig iron, scrap iron, timber, oil, steel, and tools worth 7,990 yuan per day.

Illegal Purchasing

With the prevalence of theft and looting, purchasing stations and smelting furnaces have sprung up around Linsteel. According to an initial estimate by Linsteel's economic police squad, since 1985, villagers around Linsteel have set up over a hundred fixed and mobile purchasing stations and more than 20 smelting furnaces. On a street in Dongguan Village, within a 50-meter stretch, there are 8 purchasing stations. In addition to those set up by local villagers, some are operated by outsiders who rent houses to set up shop.

These purchasing stations are bustling with people and vehicles every day, with a steady stream of "scrap" sellers. Some purchasers do not discriminate between scrap and finished products, providing convenience for those who steal and loot Linsteel's materials. Last year, Linsteel Public Security Bureau discovered 34 illegal purchasing points for finished products. On January 8 this year, the police squad caught two women stealing pig iron at the iron warehouse. Following their leads, the police squad found over 2 tons of pig iron in a corner of a purchasing station in Dongguan Village. Additionally, the owner of a purchasing station in Kangzhuang admitted to having purchased 12 tons of finished iron on three occasions.

The pig iron stolen and looted is then sold to the operators of the smelting furnaces. The more than 20 smelting furnaces nearby are constantly shrouded in smoke, operating day and night. The pig iron and coke stored near the furnaces and in the warehouses often come from Linsteel.

Poor Management

The frequent theft of Linsteel's materials is not accidental. Linsteel has 9 factory gates, and some are poorly managed, allowing nearby villagers to enter the factory area freely. Many thieves have slipped past the guards. The small four-wheel tractor loaded with 5.3 tons of pig iron mentioned earlier was driven out through the East Gate, which is manned by guards. The factory's walls, although repaired at a cost of nearly 200,000 yuan in 1986, are still incomplete.

The management of the warehouses is even more problematic, with many materials stored outdoors and unguarded. The most frequently stolen pig iron is piled up in the open. By the end of 1988, this area had accumulated 30,000 tons of pig iron. During the reporter's visit, over two consecutive nights, he spent nearly an hour in the iron warehouse without seeing any guards or anyone coming to check. Later, a company official quietly told the reporter that since the temporary workers guarding the iron warehouse were fired two months ago for colluding with villagers to steal iron, the warehouse has been unguarded. Even more astonishing is that the management is so lax that some warehouses' materials are stolen without the factory even knowing. In January last year, the Mechanical Power Department lost 13 bearing supports worth over 6,000 yuan, and it was only after the police squad recovered the stolen items and returned them that the factory found out about the theft.

Theft by company employees is also a significant factor in Linsteel's theft problems. A worker from the Ironmaking Division admitted to stealing iron 12 times last year from the casting machine, always driving his small four-wheel tractor to work in the morning, loading the iron at noon or in the afternoon, and taking it home after work. Factory materials, including production tools like electric drills and cables, can be freely borrowed by workers, and some people often borrow and never return, while others simply steal. As for temporary workers, there are even more thieves. According to a statistical figure from Linsteel Public Security Bureau, 3,128 individuals were caught in 1988, including 1,259 factory workers (896 of whom were temporary workers).

The state's property is being damaged, and the workers' hard-earned labor is being wasted. Solving the problem of Linsteel's materials being stolen is urgent. So, what is the solution? In Linfen Steel Company and Linfen City, some insightful individuals have repeatedly suggested that Linfen Steel Company should join hands with Linfen City, share information, coordinate, and comprehensively clean up and rectify purchasing stations and smelting furnaces. While conducting legal education for villagers and workers, they should also severely crack down on theft and looting activities.

### 在偷盗的困扰中

　　在偷盗的困扰中
    本报记者  朱思雄
    近年来，一些企业和在建项目常常被偷盗者所困扰，国家和集体财产损失严重。山西临汾钢铁公司就是其中的一例。最近，根据来信反映的情况，记者赴临汾钢铁公司及其周围的村庄作了调查。
    　　　　偷抢成风
    临钢是山西省四大钢铁企业之一，地处临汾市郊，占地３．５平方公里。这个厂的固定资产约１．７４亿元，每年为国家创利２０００多万元，它生产的生铁等，是冶金部优质产品，为三晋瞩目。
    临钢家大业大，也引起了一些发财心切者和不法分子的垂涎。近年来，附近村庄村民进入临钢偷盗生铁、钢材等物资的事件日渐增多。一开始，一些村民只是一块块地偷，将铁块装进饭盒、冰糕箱、粪桶里，或者裹在棉大衣、棉被里用自行车往外带，一些妇女甚至将铁块塞进衣服里带出去。到后来，发展成用手推车、小四轮拖拉机等成车成吨地偷，甚至成群结伙，几十、上百人哄抢。
    １９８８年１１月２６日傍晚，临钢经济民警在水渣站发现一辆装着焦粉的四轮拖拉机行驶得很吃力。经检查发现，焦粉只是伪装，里面藏了整整一车偷盗的生铁，重达４．７５吨。三个偷盗者供认，十几分钟前，他们的同伙已用四轮拖拉机从临钢铁库盗走生铁５．３吨，直接卖给了临汾市物资经销托运公司。经临钢公安处立案审查，顺着这条线索，查出马旭平等１６人两个月内先后８次在临钢铁库、北货场、铸铁机等处，用四轮拖拉机盗窃生铁、混合铁共计４４．４３８吨，价值２．３万多元。
    更有甚者，一些村民明目张胆地哄抢。仅去年８月中旬，就连续发生４起上百村民哄抢运铁专列事件，抢走生铁３０余吨。今年１月１３日晚，水门街４０多个村民涌向临钢停在交接站装有生铁的两节车皮，不顾民警的劝阻，大肆哄抢。仅经济民警从现场追回的生铁就达５００多公斤。
    这些偷盗、哄抢行为给临钢造成了严重的损失。据临钢经济民警中队去年１１月的一次粗略的调查统计表明，全公司每天丢失的生铁、废铁、木料、油料、钢材和工具等，折合人民币达７９９０余元。
    　　　　非法收购
    随着偷盗、哄抢之风的盛行，收购站、化铁炉在临钢周围应运而生。据临钢经济民警中队初步估算，１９８５年以来，临钢四周的村民相继建起定点的、流动的收购站有百家左右，大小化铁炉２０多座。在东关村的一条街上，不足５０米地段内就有８个收购站。这些收购站除本地村民开设的以外，还有一些是外地人员来此租屋开设的。
    这些收购站每天人来车往，卖“废品”者络绎不绝。一些收购者不论废品、成品，来者不拒，给偷盗、哄抢临钢物资的不法之徒提供了方便。临钢公安处去年查获违法收购成品的收购点有３４家。今年１月８日，民警队在铁库抓获两名偷生铁的妇女，根据她们提供的线索，民警队在东关村一个收购站院子的角落里发现了２吨多生铁。另据康庄的一个收购站站主供认，他曾３次收购成品铁达１２吨之多。
    偷盗、哄抢来的生铁被收购站收购后，又被卖给化铁炉的经营者。附近的２０多座化铁炉成天烟雾缭绕，昼夜炼铁不停。炉旁、库内堆存的生铁、焦炭等，许多都来自临钢。
    　　　　管理不善
    临钢的物资如此频频被偷，并不是偶然的。临钢有９个厂门，有的门管理很松，附近的村民可以随便进入厂区，许多偷盗者都从门岗的眼皮下溜了过去。前边提到的装有５．３吨生铁的小四轮拖拉机，就是从有门卫把守的东大门开出去的。厂区的围墙虽在１９８６年花了近２０万元修筑，至今仍残缺不全。
    库房管理上的问题更为突出，许多物资露天存放，无人看管。被盗最多的生铁就是堆放在露天场地。到１９８８年底，这块场地已积压生铁３万吨。记者采访中，连着两个晚上在铁库内转了近一小时，既没有见到看守的人，也没有任何人来查问。事后，公司的一位同志悄悄告诉记者，自两个月前看守铁库的临时工与村民勾结偷铁全部被辞退后，铁库一直无人看守。更让人吃惊的是，管理松懈到有些库房的物资丢了厂里还不知道的程度。去年１月，机械动力处丢失轴承支架１３个，价值６０００余元，直到民警队查获赃物后送回去，厂里才知道丢了东西。
    公司内部职工的偷窃，也是临钢被偷盗困扰的一个重要方面。炼铁分厂的一名工人供认，他去年曾在铸铁机旁偷铁１２次，每次都是早上开自己的小四轮拖拉机来上班，中午或者下午装上铁，下班时拉回去。工厂的物资乃至生产工具，如手电钻、电缆等，工人可以随便借走，一些人往往有借无还，有的人干脆就偷。至于临时工，偷盗的人就更多了。临钢公安处的一份统计数字表明，１９８８年度共抓获３１２８人次，涉及厂内工人１２５９人次（其中临时工８９６人次）。
    国家的财产在遭受损失，工人辛勤劳动的汗水在白白流淌，解决临钢物资被盗的问题已刻不容缓。那么，出路何在呢？在临汾钢铁公司和临汾市，一些有识之士多次建议，临汾钢铁公司应与临汾市携起手来，互通情况，协调配合，全面清理整顿收购站、化铁炉，在对村民和工人进行法制宣传教育的同时，严厉打击偷盗哄抢的活动。
