The latest statistics show that 1988 was a year of significant breakthroughs in China's home appliance production. During this year, China's production of color televisions and washing machines both surpassed the 10 million unit mark, reaching 10.28 million units and 10.46 million units respectively. The production of tape recorders exceeded 20 million units, reaching 23.44 million units. The production of refrigerators reached 7.4 million units, with an annual growth rate of 84.4%, making it the fastest-growing industrial product of the year. According to analysis, the overheated growth in China's home appliance production last year was mainly driven by strong market demand and a buying frenzy.

Experts warn that the market information from last year was somewhat misleading. If the home appliance industry does not make appropriate adjustments this year, it may well lead to new accumulations of unsold inventory.

　　我家电生产增长过热
    若不采取对策可能形成新的积压
    新华社北京２月２８日电  （记者吴士深）据最新统计数字表明，１９８８年可称我国家用电器生产的“突破之年”。在这一年里，我国彩电、洗衣机产量双双突破１０００万部（台）大关，分别达１０２８万部和１０４６万台；录音机突破２０００万部，产量跃到２３４４万部；电冰箱产量则达７４０万台，以其年增长８４．４％的速度居各类工业产品之首。据分析，去年我国家电生产过热增长主要是受强烈的市场需求和抢购风的驱动。专家们警告说，去年的市场信息带有虚假性，今年家电工业若不加适当调整，很可能形成新的积压。
