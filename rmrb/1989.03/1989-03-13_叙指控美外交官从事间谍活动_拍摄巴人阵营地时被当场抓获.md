Syria today accused two U.S. diplomats of engaging in espionage activities near a Palestinian camp.

The two U.S. diplomats were detained by Palestinian guerrillas for eight hours last week before being handed over to Syrian authorities.

Syrian newspapers, quoting a spokesperson from the Syrian Foreign Ministry, said that the U.S. military attaché to Syria, Ward, and his assistant, Sigel, were caught red-handed taking photographs at a camp near the headquarters of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) on the outskirts of Damascus on March 3.
