We are fishermen who have been drifting on Lake Weishan for years, engaging in mobile operations. Due to the inconvenient transportation and lack of information in the lake area, as well as the shortage of funds, we have always wanted to get rich but could only sigh at the lake. To find a way for us to get rich, Zhou Changfu, a local credit employee who is also a fisherman, has visited Jinan City in our province, Zhenjiang City in Jiangsu, and Shanghai City, collecting over 120 pieces of information suitable for lake production. He then carries money in his bag and rows a small boat to the fishermen's ships to handle savings and loan business. In recent years, he has issued loans of over 1 million yuan each year, helping fishermen adopt new technologies for fish and mink farming, making most fishermen rich one after another. Everyone affectionately calls him the "Fisherman's God of Wealth."

The fishermen Hu Xianyu and his brother from Aihu Village were originally poor, with no place to use their strength, and were over 30 years old but had not yet married. Old Zhou lent them 3,800 yuan to buy a boat and helped them find a source of goods. In less than two years, the brothers not only repaid the loan but also had over 5,000 yuan left, and both got married. Hu Xianyu and his brother gave Old Zhou 1,000 yuan as a token of thanks, but Old Zhou politely declined.

For 10 years, Zhou Changfu has been rowing a small boat, crossing reed marshes, and circling fish ponds, traveling through the hundred-mile water town. The concerns and good deeds he has done for our fishermen are like the lotus flowers on Lake Weishan, countless.

　　夸夸俺们的“渔财神”
    我们是长年漂泊在微山湖上流动作业的渔民。由于湖区交通不便，信息闭塞，缺乏资金，想致富却只能望湖兴叹。为了给俺们找致富门路，渔民出身的乡信贷员周长福先后到我省济宁市、江苏镇江市和上海市等地考察，收集适合湖区生产的信息１２０多条，然后提包里装着钱，划着小船，到渔民船头上办理储贷业务。近几年，他每年都发放贷款１００多万元，帮助渔民采用新技术养鱼、养貂，使大部分渔民先后富起来。大家亲切地称他“渔财神”。
    爱湖村渔民胡宪玉兄弟俩原先家里贫穷，有力无处使，３０多岁还没娶上媳妇。老周给他俩贷款３８００元，买了一条船，又帮他们联系货源。没出两年，弟兄俩不仅还清了贷款，还剩下５０００多元，都娶上了媳妇。胡宪玉弟兄俩给老周送去１０００元谢礼，老周婉言谢绝了。
    １０年来，周长福划着小船，穿芦荡，绕鱼塘，奔波在百里水乡。他为俺渔民操的心，办的好事，就像微山湖上的荷花，数也数不完。
