Ethnic minority representatives attending the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress recently shared their thoughts with reporters: A stable and united social environment is the fundamental guarantee for ethnic minorities to develop their economies and improve their living standards.

Jinghong County's Jingpo representative He Gui said that during the turbulent years before liberation, it was impossible to talk about production, as even survival was difficult. At the time of liberation, there were only about 3,000 Jingpo people left. After liberation, the villages were peaceful, and production began to develop. However, in 1958, the village fell into chaos again, and many people fled to other countries. In the past ten years, the Jingpo people have experienced a dramatic change in their lives in a stable environment.

"Ethnic minorities cannot do without the Han people, and the Han people cannot do without ethnic minorities. This is the experience we Yis have gained from practice." Huang Guifang, a Yis woman cadre from the hometown of Ashima, said, "In our Lushan Yis Autonomous County, Yis and Han cadres and the masses respect and love each other. Ethnic unity has promoted economic development, and last year's total output value reached 14.85 million yuan."

　　少数民族代表谈发展民族经济        
    稳定团结最重要
    据新华社北京３月２７日电  （记者徐江善、郑战国）出席七届人大二次会议的少数民族代表近日向记者畅谈了体会：稳定团结的社会环境，是少数民族发展经济、提高生活水平的根本保证。
    云南景洪县基诺族代表何贵说，在解放前的动乱年代，不要说发展生产，性命都难保，解放时基诺人仅剩３０００多人。解放后，村寨安宁、生产有了发展，可在１９５８年寨子又乱了，许多人逃到异国。最近这十年，基诺人在稳定的环境里，生活发生翻天覆地的变化。
    “少数民族离不开汉族、汉族离不开少数民族，这是我们彝族群众从实践中得出的经验”。来自阿诗玛故乡的彝族女干部黄桂芳说，我们路南彝族自治县彝汉干部、群众互尊互爱，民族团结促进了经济的发展，去年总产值达到１４８５万元。
