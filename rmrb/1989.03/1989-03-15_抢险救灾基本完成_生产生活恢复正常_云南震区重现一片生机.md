Now, in the areas of Lincang and Gengma in Yunnan, which were recently hit by a severe earthquake, double-cropping rice has already been sown, and spring farming is beginning as usual. In the remote Ailao Mountains, thousands of people are setting up camps and digging tea gardens. Damaged farmland, irrigation canals, and reservoirs have been assessed and repairs are underway. Eighteen sugar mills, after day and night repairs, have resumed operations on schedule. Of the 36 damaged roads, all but one have been repaired. Over 3,000 communication lines have also been restored.

After the earthquake, more than 20,000 people from Yunnan Province rushed to the disaster area for rescue and relief efforts. They rescued large quantities of grain, fertilizers, pesticides, various equipment, and commercial goods. They also treated more than 83,000 injured and sick people. Due to the timely and effective measures taken by the medical departments, the outbreak of malaria, dysentery, influenza, and other infectious diseases was effectively prevented in the disaster-stricken area, known as the "land of pestilence." The disabled, orphans, and widowed elderly also received proper arrangements.

The central government and various departments of the province allocated special funds and organized the transportation of large quantities of grain and materials to stabilize the lives of the disaster victims. Now, more than 100,000 damaged houses, after being assessed by experts organized by the province, are being repaired, demolished, and rebuilt. The provincial design department has also designed economical and somewhat earthquake-resistant housing for ethnic minority areas.

　　抢险救灾基本完成　生产生活恢复正常
    云南震区重现一片生机
    本报昆明３月１４日电  如今，在前不久遭受严重地震灾害的云南澜沧、耿马地区，双季稻已经播种，春耕生产如常开始；偏远的阿佤山上，几千人正安营扎寨开挖茶园；受损农田、水渠、水库经过鉴定已开始着手修复。１８个受灾糖厂经昼夜抢修，按季开榨。被地震损坏的３６条公路除一条外，全部修通。３０００多对通讯线路也已修复。
    这次地震发生后，云南省有２万多人赴灾区抢险救灾，抢救出大批粮食、化肥、农药、各种设备和商业物资。收治了８３０００多名伤病员。由于医疗部门采取及时、有力的措施，被称为“瘴疠之乡”的灾区有效地防止了疟疾、痢疾、流感等传染病的发生。致残者、孤儿、孤寡老人也得到了妥善安排。
    中央和省各部门还拨出专款，并组织调运了大量的粮食、物资，安定灾民生活。现在，１００多万间受损房屋经过省里专门组织的专家鉴定，开始修复、拆迁和重建。省设计部门还为少数民族地区设计出了既经济，又具有一定抗震能力的住房。
