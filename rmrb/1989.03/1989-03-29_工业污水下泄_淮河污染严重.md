	Industrial Wastewater Discharged
		Severe Pollution in the Huai River

	From February 11th to 13th, 45 million cubic meters of industrial wastewater accumulated in the sluice between Fuyang and Yingzhou in Anhui Province was discharged into the Huai River. This created a 60-kilometer-long massive wastewater plume, polluting over 200 kilometers of the Huai River downstream and the Hongze Lake. This pollution originated from multiple factories in Fuyang, Liu'an, and Huaian that produce paper, dyeing, fertilizer, and leather, among other products, without proper treatment. The wastewater affected the drinking water and industrial water supply for humans and livestock along the downstream shores, causing significant harm. The water supply plant in Xuyi County, Jiangsu Province, was forced to halt operations on March 3rd, leaving urban residents to rely on well water, which caused water supply difficulties. Some factories in the area also had to stop production.

	This is the largest water pollution incident in the history of the Huai River, which will have a serious impact on the aquaculture and ecological environment of the downstream Huai River and Hongze Lake.

　　工业污水下泄        
    淮河污染严重
    二月十一日至十三日，安徽阜阳至颍上闸槽积存的四千五百万立方米工业污水泄入淮河，形成六十公里的巨大污水团，使淮河下游二百多公里的水域和洪泽湖遭受大面积污染。这次污染来自安徽阜阳、六安、淮南等地市多家造纸、印染、化肥、制革等厂未经处理的污水。污水所到之处，给下游沿岸的人畜饮水和生产用水带来很大危害。江苏盱眙县自来水厂于三月三日被迫停产，城镇居民只好饮用井水，用水发生困难。这里的部分工厂也停产。
    这起淮河历史上最大的水污染事故，将对淮河下游及洪泽湖水产养殖业和生态环境发生严重破坏作用。
