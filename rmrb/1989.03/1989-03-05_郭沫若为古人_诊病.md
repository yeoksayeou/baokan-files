Guo Moruo once studied medicine at Kyushu Imperial University in Japan. After turning to literature, he applied his medical knowledge to historical and literary research, diagnosing many historical figures.

In his famous essay "Research on Qu Yuan," Guo Moruo diagnosed some of Qu Yuan's mental and physical ailments: "His sorrow and melancholy, lingering for so long, could not help but harm his spirit and body. He seemed to suffer from insomnia. Look at what he said: 'Tears and sorrow mix, sad and lonely, thinking without sleep until dawn... Looking at the short nights of early summer, how dark and bright they are like a year.' He also had physical pain: 'My back and chest are intertwined with pain, my heart is knotted and twisted.' This is probably neuralgia, or perhaps pleurisy."

Regarding the illness of the famous musician Wan Baochang of the Sui Dynasty, Guo Moruo diagnosed: "Since it is said to be a bedridden illness, it is certainly not an external injury; since it is said to have died of hunger, it is certainly not a disease of the stomach and intestines. Being sick to the point of death but still able to get up and burn books, his consciousness is very clear, so it is certainly not a fever or madness. I speculate that his illness is related to the respiratory system, perhaps it is tuberculosis." (Historical Figures, page 142)

Regarding Li Bai's fatal illness, Guo Moruo's diagnosis is the most vivid: "Pi Rixiu's Seven Loves Poem says Li Bai 'finally suffered from a decaying chest illness, and his drunken soul returned to the eighth extreme.' 'Decaying chest illness' should be chronic empyema perforation. The causes of chronic lung empyema perforation are various, and alcohol poisoning is one of them. Pus accumulates between the lungs and the chest wall and erodes outward, perforating, which is probably what is called 'decaying chest illness.'"

### 郭沫若为古人“诊病”

　　郭沫若为古人“诊病”
    郭沫若早年曾在日本九州帝国大学医科学医，从文后将医学知识用于文史研究中，为许多历史人物做了“诊断”。
    在著名的《屈原研究》一文中，郭沫若对屈原的一些精神和身体疾病做了诊断：“他的悲伤忧郁，长久不能去怀，精神和身体不能不受损害。他似乎是有失眠症的人。请看他说：‘涕泣交而凄凄兮，思不眠以至曙……望孟夏之短夜兮，何晦明之若岁。’还有身体上也确实有痛苦：‘背膺牉以交痛兮，心郁结而纤轸。’这大约是神经痛，不然便是胁膜炎。”
    对于隋朝大音乐家万宝常的“卧疾”，郭沫若诊断：“既然是说卧疾，当然不是外伤；既然说是饿而死，当然不是病的胃肠。病到将死还可以起来烧书，意识也很清明，当然不是瘟热和癫狂。我揣想他的病是属于呼吸系统的，或者就是肺结核。”（《历史人物》１４２页）对于李白的死疾，郭沫若断得最为精彩：“皮日休《七爱诗》说李白‘竟遭腐胁疾，醉魄归八极’。‘腐胁疾’顾义当是慢性脓胸穿孔。慢性脓肺穿孔病源有种种，酒精中毒也是其一。肺部与胸壁之间蓄脓向体外腐蚀穿孔，这可能就是所谓‘腐胁疾’。”（《郭沫若全集·历史编四》２９８页）
