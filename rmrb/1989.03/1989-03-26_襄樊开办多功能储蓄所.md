Shiyan Opens Multi-Functional Savings Offices

People's Daily reports that the 36 savings offices under the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Shiyan City, Hubei Province, have shifted from single deposit services to multi-functional operations, significantly enhancing their capital-raising capabilities. From 1988 to the present, they have raised over 50 million yuan.

Previously, the financial sector only allowed savings offices to handle single deposit services. This bank has expanded the types of savings services, maintaining the principle of deposit-based operations while boldly introducing settlement, credit, wage payment, information consulting, and cash custody services.

　　襄樊开办多功能储蓄所
    本报讯  湖北省襄樊市工商银行所属３６个储蓄所由单一存款向多功能转变，聚资能力大增，从１９８８年到现在，已聚集资金５０００多万元。
    过去，金融界只允许储蓄所办理单一的存款业务。这家银行拓宽储蓄业务种类，在坚持以存为主的基础上，试办了多功能储蓄所，大胆开办结算、信贷、代办工资、信息咨询和代保管现金等多项业务。
