Early in this century, a car rally across the Eurasian continent shocked the world. Eighty-odd years later, a Beijing-to-Paris vintage car expedition is once again traversing the "Silk Road," promising a more colorful and thrilling spectacle of courage and determination.

On January 31, 1907, the Paris *Morning Post* issued a daring challenge: "This summer, is anyone willing to drive from Beijing to Paris? The journey is 16,000 kilometers. Daredevils, sign up now! It will be a unique and great test!" Soon, 25 teams from European countries accepted the challenge, eager to compete. The Italian team consisted of Prince Scipione Borghese, mechanic Ettore Guizzardi, and special correspondents Luigi Barzini from the *Evening Post* and the *Telegraph*. They chose an "Itala" car, which was shipped to Beijing by sea. On June 10, the "Itala" set off from Beijing (see photo). At that time, Beijing residents also bid farewell to three French cars and one Dutch car. A few days later, the "Itala" began to take the lead. As the car entered Siberia, the "Itala" unfortunately fell into the water while crossing a small bridge, and the tires were damaged. The three drivers did not retreat; they salvaged and repaired the car and continued westward. On August 10, the "Itala" arrived in Paris first.

The triumphant "Itala" has been preserved in the Turin Automobile Museum. It was a product of the "Itala Automobile Factory," established in Turin in 1904, with 45 horsepower and a top speed of 45 kilometers per hour. After that long journey, the car looked old and worn, but visitors still flocked to see it. It was once exhibited in the United States and, upon its return to Italy, fell into the sea near Genoa, further damaging the vehicle.

For many years, people have dreamed of restoring the "Itala." In November 1986, the financially robust Fiat Group began the restoration work. After two years of hard work and an investment of approximately $240,000, the "Itala" was finally restored to its former glory, allowing it to participate in this vintage car expedition once again. The difference this time is that 82 years ago, the "Itala" took the northern route, while this time it chose the southern route, which is 4,000 kilometers longer. Italy's "Channel 1" also dispatched a film crew to capture local customs, people, and famous landmarks along the way. Over the course of more than three months, a 20-minute special program is planned to be broadcast every week.

The "Itala" is now racing across the ancient lands of China, welcoming the winds of reform and opening up. May the "Itala" see and hear much along the way, bringing good news back to the Italian people.

　　伊塔拉再展雄风
    本世纪初，一次穿越亚欧大陆的汽车拉力赛震撼了世界。８０多年后的今天，一支北京—巴黎老式汽车远征队又沿着“丝绸之路”驰骋，那比雄心比毅力的多彩场面将更加引人入胜。
    １９０７年１月３１日，巴黎《晨报》发出了一个惊人的挑战：“今夏有人愿意开车从北京到巴黎吗？行程１．６万公里，无畏者赶快响应！将是一次举世无双的伟大考验！”不久，欧洲国家的２５个车队接受挑战，意欲比个高低。意大利车队由亲王希皮奥内·博尔盖塞、机械师埃托雷·古伊扎典和《晚邮报》、《电讯报》特派记者路易吉·巴尔齐尼３人组成。他们挑选了一辆“伊塔拉”汽车，经海路运到北京。６月１０日，“伊塔拉”车从北京出发（见照片），当时北京人送别的还有三辆法国车和一辆荷兰车。几天后，“伊塔拉”开始领先。车队进入西伯利亚，“伊塔拉”在穿越一座小桥时，不幸掉入水中，轮胎破裂了。三位驾车人没有退缩，他们打捞抢修后，继续西行。８月１０日“伊塔拉”首先抵达巴黎。
    凯旋的“伊塔拉”一直珍藏在都灵汽车博物馆。它是１９０４年创建于都灵的“伊塔拉汽车制造厂”的产品，４５匹马力，最高时速４５公里。经过那次长途跋涉，汽车虽显得老态龙钟，但参观者仍络绎不绝，并曾运至美国展览，在返回意大利时，又落入热那亚海中，车体更是伤痕累累。
    多年来，不少人一直梦想修复“伊塔拉”。１９８６年１１月，财力雄厚的菲亚特集团开始了修复工作。经过两年辛勤作业，耗资约２４万美元，总算恢复了“伊塔拉”的青春，使它得以在这次老式汽车远征中再展雄风。所不同的是，８２年前“伊塔拉”走的是北线，这次却选择了南线，比北线长４０００多公里。意大利“电视一台”还特派一摄影组，随队抢拍风土人情和名胜古迹。在长达３个多月的日子里，计划每周播放２０分钟专题节目。
    “伊塔拉”正在古老中国的大地上迎着改革开放的春风奔驰，愿“伊塔拉”沿途多见广闻，把美好的信息带给意大利人民。
