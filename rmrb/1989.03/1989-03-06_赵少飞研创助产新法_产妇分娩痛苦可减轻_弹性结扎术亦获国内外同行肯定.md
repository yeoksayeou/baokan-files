Zhao Shaofei Develops New Childbirth Assistance Method
Reduces Pain for Mothers in Labor
Elastic Ligature Technique Also Gains Recognition from Domestic and International Peers

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 5th – (Correspondent Wang Zhongqi) The research and development of the air-cushion abdominal pressure belt with abdominal pressure application in the second stage of labor by Zhao Shaofei, a chief physician at the Anshan Steelworks Lishan Hospital's Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, has significantly reduced the pain for countless women and has been recognized by domestic and international obstetrics and gynecology experts.

At 39 years old, Zhao Shaofei graduated from China Medical University in 1979. He addressed the current domestic and international methods for dealing with insufficient labor force in the second stage of labor, which primarily include the use of forceps, vacuum extraction, oxytocin to enhance uterine contractions, and cesarean sections. Zhao developed the air-cushion abdominal pressure belt with abdominal pressure application, which reduces the pain experienced by mothers during childbirth, thereby expediting the delivery process. Nearly 100 mothers who used this method had an average time of 27.1 minutes for the baby to be delivered, compared to the previous average of 52.8 minutes. In April last year, Zhao Shaofei was invited to participate in the 11th European Perinatal Medicine Academic Conference and submitted a related academic paper.

Submucosal uterine fibroids are a common gynecological condition. Previously, methods involved using forceps or strings to clamp and tie off the fibroid's base, causing it to die off. The patient would then need to rest in bed for one to two days before the fibroid, along with the forceps or strings, could be removed. In more severe cases, the uterus would need to be removed. Zhao Shaofei successfully developed the elastic ligature technique for submucosal uterine fibroids, which uses the elasticity of rubber rings to block the blood supply to the fibroid, causing it to fall off on its own. The clinical success rate is 100%. At the end-of-year First Jinan International Obstetrics and Gynecology Conference, domestic and international experts and scholars agreed that this method has significant potential for widespread application.

　　赵少飞研创助产新法
    产妇分娩痛苦可减轻
    弹性结扎术亦获国内外同行肯定
    新华社沈阳３月５日电  （通讯员王忠奇）鞍钢立山医院妇产科主治医师赵少飞取得的气囊腹压带加腹压法在第二产程中的应用和研究等两项科研成果，为千百万妇女减少了痛苦，得到国内外妇产科专家的肯定。
    ３９岁的赵少飞，１９７９年毕业于中国医科大学。他针对目前国内外对第二产程中解决产力不足的主要应急措施为产钳、胎头吸引、催产素加强宫缩及剖宫术的情况，研制出气囊腹压带加腹压法，减轻了产妇在分娩时的痛苦，从而使分娩迅速结束。近百名产妇采用这一方法后，胎儿娩出平均时间为２７．１分钟，过去则需要５２．８分钟。去年４月，赵少飞应邀参加了第１１届欧洲围产医学学术会议，并提交了有关的学术论文。
    粘膜下子宫肌瘤是妇科常见病，过去采用钳子夹或用线绳扎的方法，将子宫肌瘤根部掐死，待患者卧床一至二天后连同钳子或线绳摘出肌瘤，肌瘤特殊的，还需要摘除子宫。赵少飞研制成功的粘膜下子宫肌瘤弹性结扎术，是利用橡胶圈的弹性，套住并阻断瘤体血运，使瘤体自行脱落。临床成功率达到１００％。在去年底召开的第一届济南国际妇产科会议上，国内外专家和学者认为这种方法具有推广价值。
