The Shaanxi Provincial Government has introduced a new measure: parents will be fined if their children drop out of school. The government has decided that parents or guardians of children who do not enroll in compulsory education on time or who drop out midway will be criticized and educated by the township (town) people's government or the street office. In addition to ordering them to enroll their children or wards in school, they will be fined between 30 and 100 yuan.

Early this month, six village-run primary schools in Xinhua County, Hunan Province, including Dongling Township Yuanjia Primary School, Wushi Township Tongli Primary School, and Cangxi Township Cangxi Primary School, had their school buildings sold by the village. The money was used to set up power lines or build bridges, among other things. Teachers and students were forced to study in dilapidated buildings.

In December last year, Zhao Ying, the manager of the private enterprise Xianglin Lace Crafts Company in Lanzhou, donated 40 sewing machines and hired a highly paid instructor to teach lace-making to detainees in a labor re-education camp in Gansu Province. She also welcomed participants in the training to work at her company after their release from re-education. (Xinhua News Agency)

    湖南新化出怪事：校舍卖掉换钱花
    ●陕西省人民政府最近决定，不送儿童上学要受罚。凡不按时入学接受义务教育或中途辍学的适龄儿童、少年，由乡（镇）人民政府或街道办事处对其父母或其监护人进行批评教育，除责令其送子女或被监护者入学外，分别处以罚款３０至１００元。
