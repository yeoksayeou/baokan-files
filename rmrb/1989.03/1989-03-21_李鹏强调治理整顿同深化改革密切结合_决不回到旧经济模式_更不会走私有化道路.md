Li Peng emphasized combining economic rectification with deepening reform
    We will not return to the old economic model
    And we will not take the path of privatization

    Xinhua News Agency Beijing, March 20th — In his government work report to the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, Premier Li Peng proposed that economic rectification and deepening reform must be closely combined. He said, we will not return to the old economic model of excessive centralization and over-regulation, nor will we take the path of privatization that denies the socialist system. The many rectification measures we are currently taking are themselves important components of deepening reform. If rectification and adjustment are successful, they can create a better macroeconomic environment for deepening reform and better promote the development of a socialist commodity economy.

    Li Peng said, the economic system reform in 1989 should focus on improving and developing the various reform measures that have already been introduced, while also coordinating with rectification and adjustment to explore new reforms. The key is to continue improving and developing the contract responsibility system for industrial and commercial enterprises, actively explore measures and methods to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation, cultivate an orderly market, and alleviate the contradictions of unfair distribution. All reforms must closely revolve around the central task of rectification and adjustment, ensuring they help to curb demand, adjust the structure, increase effective supply, and improve economic efficiency.

　　李鹏强调治理整顿同深化改革密切结合         
    决不回到旧经济模式        
    更不会走私有化道路
    新华社北京３月２０日电  李鹏总理在七届人大二次会议的政府工作报告中提出，要把治理整顿同深化改革密切结合起来。他说，我们决不会回到过度集中、管得过多过死的旧的经济模式上去，更不会走否定社会主义制度的私有化道路。当前我们采取的许多治理整顿措施，本身就是深化改革的重要内容。治理和整顿搞好了，就可以在宏观上为深化改革创造比较好的环境，更好地促进社会主义商品经济发展。
    李鹏说，１９８９年的经济体制改革要着重完善和发展已经出台的各项改革措施，同时配合治理整顿，进行新的改革探索。重点是继续完善和发展工商企业承包经营责任制，积极探索加强和改善宏观经济调控的措施和方法，培育有秩序的市场，缓解分配不公的矛盾。各项改革必须紧紧围绕治理整顿这个中心，做到有利于压缩需求，调整结构，有利于增加有效供给，提高经济效益。
