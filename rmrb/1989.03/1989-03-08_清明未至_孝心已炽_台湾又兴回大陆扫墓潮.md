Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th.

Before the Qingming Festival, filial piety burns bright. Taiwan is experiencing another wave of visits to the mainland for grave-sweeping. In the past two months, the number of Taiwanese people registering with the Taiwan Red Cross Society each day has reached 2,000.

The reports say that among those who have recently registered with the Taiwan Red Cross Society, 80% hope to return to their hometowns on the mainland to sweep graves and pay respects to their ancestors, fulfilling their duties as children. Most of them had already visited the mainland last year.

In addition to returning home to sweep graves, they also plan to participate in 9 to 12-day tour groups to visit famous scenic spots and historical sites across the mainland.
