Work groups composed of personnel from the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Agriculture will depart today and tomorrow for Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces and regions to inspect the living conditions in severely affected areas and arrange for production and relief work.

Last year, some parts of China experienced severe droughts, floods, hailstorms, frost, and earthquakes, which caused difficulties for the lives and production of the people. The State Council and local governments at all levels in the disaster-stricken areas have attached great importance to disaster relief and rescue work, promptly organizing manpower, material resources, and financial support to arrange for the living conditions in the disaster-stricken areas, restore production, and rebuild homes. Currently, the people in the disaster-stricken areas have successfully endured the severe winter, their minds are at ease, social order is good, and spring farming has been widely carried out.

However, the difficulties in the severely affected areas have not been completely resolved, especially from March to the summer harvest period, the living and production of some people in the severely affected areas still face many difficulties. To do a good job in arranging for the living conditions of the people in the disaster-stricken areas during the spring famine period, the relevant departments of the State Council have taken active measures to help local areas do a good job in living and production relief work. In recent days, according to the instructions of the leaders of the State Council, the General Office of the State Council organized the above-mentioned departments to form work groups and rush to the four provinces and regions with severe disasters to assist local areas in doing a good job in production and relief work.

    国务院派工作组赴西南四省区
    检查灾区生活　安排生产救灾
    新华社北京3月1日电  由国家计委、民政部、商业部、财政部、农业部等部门组成的工作组今明两天分别赶赴云南、贵州、广西、海南等省区，检查重灾区生活，安排生产救灾工作。
    去年，我国部分地区遭受严重干旱、洪涝、风雹、冷冻、地震等自然灾害，给群众生活、生产带来一定困难。国务院和灾区各级人民政府对抗灾、救灾工作极为重视，及时组织人力、物力和财力安排灾区生活，恢复生产，重建家园。目前，灾区人民已顺利度过严冬，人心安定，社会秩序良好，春耕生产已广泛开展起来。
    但是，重灾地区的困难尚未完全解决，尤其是3月至夏收期间，重灾地区部分群众的生活、生产仍然面临许多困难。为做好灾区人民春荒期间的生活安排，国务院有关部门已采取积极措施，帮助各地做好生活、生产救灾工作。近日根据国务院领导同志的指示，国务院办公厅又组织以上几个部门组成工作组赶赴灾情较重的四省区，协助各地做好生产救灾工作。
