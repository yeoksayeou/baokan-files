Progress in Rectification and Adjustment: New Challenges Facing Large and Medium-Sized Enterprises

— Summary of Speeches by Managers of Some Enterprises in Shenyang

How is the current rectification and adjustment situation? What are the enterprises' reactions to it? Recently, the Economic Department of this newspaper, in collaboration with the Shenyang Municipal Enterprise Federation, invited 27 managers, factory directors, and bank officials from large and medium-sized enterprises in Shenyang for a discussion.

They unanimously agreed that rectification and adjustment are necessary and have already achieved initial results. They hope that this effort will be steadfastly pursued.

At the same time, they presented several new situations and problems, urging all parties to pay attention and take measures to resolve them, ensuring the healthy development of rectification and adjustment.

		Rectification measures should be coordinated, with appropriate speed, fast where necessary, slow where necessary, and relevant departments should act promptly

Chen Fengzhi, director of Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory, said, "Economic overheating and inflation did not happen overnight, and the brakes cannot be applied too abruptly. Now, some measures that should be implemented quickly are not coming down fast enough, while some that should be gradual are coming down too abruptly. Our factory is manufacturing equipment for a major steel plant's second-phase project, and they owe us 20 million yuan. However, whether this project will be continued or not is still undecided, but the tightening of credit is very fast, making it difficult for us to stop work or continue, because we have no money to buy raw materials. I think the project decision should be made faster, and the tightening of credit should be slower, otherwise, it will be very difficult for enterprises."

Summer Renfan, manager of Shenyang Long-Distance Bus Company, said, "Various supervisory departments should quickly formulate specific implementation measures, otherwise, it will be difficult to 'cool down' if the upper levels require it, the lower levels hope for it, but the intermediate measures are not timely."

Liu Yanchao, manager of Shenyang Peace Commercial Center, said, "Rectification measures should be as coordinated as possible. In a short period, there have been more than ten documents on the exclusive operation of color TVs, making the documents devalued."

		As the backbone of the national economy, large and medium-sized enterprises were already not very active, and now their situation is even more difficult, which urgently needs to be reversed

Xu Youpan, director of Shenyang Cable Factory, said, "The core of reform is to activate enterprises, but now large and medium-sized enterprises are becoming more rigid in some aspects. Last year, our factory was shut down for several months, which is unprecedented in history. I, a man in his late 50s, cried three times to the reporter. I fully support rectification and adjustment, but we should rectify what needs to be rectified, and not kill large and medium-sized enterprises."

Liu Baoli, director of Shenyang Third Machine Tool Factory, said, "To solve the problem of overheating, if large and medium-sized enterprises are affected, it means that those who contribute are harmed. We should summarize experiences, and the key to vitality is to focus on developing productive forces. Now, the enthusiasm of workers in large and medium-sized enterprises is suppressed, and some individual incomes are higher, leading to workers' alienation. Enterprises can only distribute a small part of the money to frontline workers, trying to keep the backbone together."

Zhou Changchun of Shenyang Municipal Planning Commission said, "Now, rectification and adjustment must pay attention to changes in the macro environment. In 1980, products under state planning control accounted for 80%, now it has dropped to 30%. If we still use the method of controlling 30% to control the remaining 70%, it definitely won't work. If we don't pay attention to this reality and take measures based on this situation, it is possible that the medicine will not reach the diseased parts, but the parts without disease will be affected by the medicine."

		Funding tightness is a common problem faced by enterprises. Where did the funds go? How to reflect the policy of tilting in funds? These are urgent problems to be solved

Liu Yanchao, manager of Shenyang Peace Commercial Center, said, "The circulation sector occupies too much funds, while the production sector occupies relatively less. This is an important reason for the current fund tightness. 'Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants all engage in commerce,' and setting up a company requires a certain amount of funds, which are only used to circulate goods, causing price increases. Xu Youpan, director of Shenyang Cable Factory, said, "Cash has all run into the hands of speculators and 'touts.' Our enterprise cannot use 30 yuan in cash, but now someone can use 300, 3000, or even 30,000. I have seen with my own eyes someone with 300,000 yuan in their bag."

Gao Songshan, director of Shenyang Rolling Mill, said, "It is relatively easier to deal with 'official speculators.' Once you withdraw the funds from their hands, they will not be able to operate. For production units, especially key enterprises, support should be provided. There should be both lending and borrowing, both protection and pressure, both relaxation and tightness, with appropriate strictness and leniency, seeking activity in tightness, and seeking activity in reform. The key to solving inflation is to increase effective supply."

Li Zhonglu, deputy mayor of Shenyang, said, "The tightness of enterprise funds is fundamentally caused by the heavy burden on enterprises. Now, the profit rate should be around 20%. After deducting the profits and taxes handed over and various fees, enterprises can only retain about 15% of this. Therefore, not only do enterprises rely on bank loans for technological transformation, but enterprise working capital also often relies on bank loans."

Liu Baoli, director of Shenyang Third Machine Tool Factory, said, "After years of efforts, we have 50% of our output products exported, opening up the international market. If we cannot buy raw materials due to lack of money and cannot deliver on time, losing credibility and market, it will be too regrettable! Enterprise technological transformation can be postponed for 1 to 3 years, but working capital must be guaranteed. Su Tingke, president of Shenyang Enterprise Federation, said, "Now, the triangular debt among enterprises is also a cause of fund tightness. Can we consider issuing a one-time 'start-up fund' to get the funds flowing first? This is like using a water pump to draw water, first pouring some water in, and then drawing more underground water."

　　治理整顿取得进展  大中型企业面临新问题        
    ——沈阳市部分厂长经理座谈发言摘要
    当前治理整顿情况如何？企业对此有何反映？最近，本报经济部同沈阳市企协联合邀集了沈阳市２７家大中型企业的厂长、经理、银行负责人一起座谈。
    他们一致认为，治理整顿非常必要，而且已经取得初步成效。希望坚定不移地抓下去。
    同时，也摆出了若干新情况、新问题，吁请各方予以注意，并采取措施加以解决，以保障治理整顿的健康发展。
    　　　　整治措施要注意配套，要紧慢适当，该快的则快，该缓的则缓，主管部门动作要跟上
    沈阳矿山机械厂厂长陈凤志说，经济过热、通货膨胀，非一日形成，刹车不可过猛。现在有些该快的措施下来的不快，该缓些的措施却来得过猛。我们厂为某大钢厂二期工程制造设备，已欠我２０００万元。但这个项目现在是砍是留举棋未定，可是银根收紧很快，弄得我们不敢停工，又不能继续干下去，因为买原材料已经没有钱了。我认为，项目决定该快些，收紧银根应缓一些，不然企业很难办。
    沈阳市长途客运汽车公司经理夏仁凡说，各个主管部门应该很快制订具体落实措施，不然，上边要求“凉”，下面希望“凉”，中间措施不及时，也很难“凉”下来。
    沈阳市和平商场经理刘延昭说，治理措施要尽量配套。光彩电专营文件，短时间就发了十几个，弄得文件也贬值了。
    　　　　作为国民经济骨干的大中型企业，原来就搞得不够活，现在他们的处境大都更加困难，此情况亟须加以扭转
    沈阳电缆厂厂长徐有泮说，改革的中心环节是搞活企业，可现在大中型企业有些方面越搞越死。去年我们厂停工几个月，是历史没有过的。急得我这个快６０岁的人，向记者哭了３次。治理整顿我完全赞成，但要整那些该整的，可别把大中型企业整死。
    沈阳第三机床厂厂长刘宝利说，解决过热的问题，如果整到大中型企业身上，那就是作贡献者反倒身受其害。要总结经验，活力问题主要要着眼于发展生产力。现在大中型企业职工积极性受压抑，一些个体户收入偏高，导致职工离心，企业只好把仅有的一部分钱分给一线工人，努力把骨干拢住。
    沈阳市计委周长春说，现在治理整顿一定要注意大环境的变化。１９８０年时，国家计划控制的产品占８０％，现在降到３０％，如果还用管３０％的办法去管那７０％，肯定不行。不重视这个现实，不根据这个情况采取措施，就有可能，有病的地方药到不了，没病的地方反而被药拿住了。
    　　　　资金紧张是企业普遍感受到的情况。资金哪里去了？怎样在资金上体现倾斜政策？是亟待解决的问题
    沈阳市和平商场经理刘延昭说，流通领域占用资金过多，生产领域占用资金相对不足，这是当前资金紧张的重要原因。“工农兵学商，一齐来经商”，办一个公司就要占一定数量的资金，这些资金只是把商品倒来倒去，倒得物价上涨。沈阳电缆厂厂长徐有泮说，现金都跑到二道贩子、“倒爷”手里去了。我们企业动用３０元现金都不行，但现在有人可动用３００、３０００、３万，我亲眼看见有人皮包里装了３０万元。
    沈阳轧钢厂厂长高嵩山说，“官倒”也比较好治，你把他手里的资金一抽，他就不好活动了。对生产单位，特别是骨干企业，应该给予支持。要有收有贷，有保有压，有松有紧，宽严适度，紧中求活，改中求活。解决通货膨胀，重要是增加有效供给。
    沈阳市副市长李中鲁说，企业资金紧张，从根本上说是企业负担过重造成的。现在产值利润率应在２０％左右，除去上缴利税和各种费用外，企业能留下的只是这中间的１５％左右。因此，不仅企业的技术改造要靠银行贷款，企业的流动资金，也常常要靠银行贷款。
    沈阳第三机床厂厂长刘宝利说，经过几年努力，我们有５０％产值的产品出口，打开了国际市场。如果因为无钱买原材料，不能按时交货，丢掉信誉，丢掉市场，太可惜了！企业技术改造，１至３年内可以暂缓，流动资金必须保我。沈阳市企业家协会会长苏廷科说，现在企业间三角拖欠，也是造成资金紧张的原因之一。能不能考虑发放一次性的“启动资金”，先让资金流动起来。这就像用压水机抽水，先灌点水进去，才能把更多的地下水“逗”上来。
