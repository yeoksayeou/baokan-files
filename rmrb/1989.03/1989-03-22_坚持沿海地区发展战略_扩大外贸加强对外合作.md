	Premier Li Peng emphasized at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress that during the period of readjustment and rectification, we must expand foreign trade and strengthen economic and technological cooperation with other countries, so that opening up to the outside world and readjustment and rectification can promote each other.

	The contents of Li Peng's speech on developing opening up to the outside world during the period of readjustment and rectification include:

	We must persist in implementing the coastal development strategy and continue to develop an export-oriented economy. At the same time, he proposed that we should properly handle the economic relations between the coastal areas and the inland regions, so that they can cooperate and promote each other on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and achieve common development.

	We must strive to ensure the continuous development of foreign trade this year. We should actively develop export production and continue to implement relevant policies and measures to encourage exports. The import of foreign trade should also be appropriately adjusted according to the requirements of readjustment and rectification and industrial policies. We must continue to deepen the reform of the foreign trade system, strengthen macro-management and supervision, implement the unified trade policy of the state, establish a good order for foreign trade, and overcome the chaotic phenomena in foreign trade.

	We must actively utilize foreign capital and introduce advanced technology. We should encourage and attract foreign investors to establish more wholly foreign-owned enterprises in China and more joint ventures and cooperative enterprises that utilize existing Chinese enterprises for transformation. We must strengthen the unified management of foreign exchange and foreign debt, appropriately control the scale of foreign debt, and improve the efficiency of foreign capital utilization. We must continue to improve the investment environment, strengthen economic legislation, help foreign investors solve practical difficulties, and safeguard the legitimate business activities of foreign investors.
