The funeral of Japan's Emperor Showa proceeded smoothly and on an unprecedented scale, which made Japanese authorities quite pleased for a while. However, two days later, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs suddenly revealed that the number of countries and regions participating in the funeral was 164, not the previously officially announced 163. The Japanese media relentlessly pursued the story.

On the evening of February 26, Uno, the Foreign Minister, summarized the diplomatic achievements of the funeral, saying, "164 countries participated in the funeral, demonstrating the world's friendship towards Japan." All global media outlets, based on the official figures released by Japan, reported that 163 countries participated in the funeral. How did an additional country come about? Reporters urgently requested a meeting with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Under the persistent questioning of the reporters, the Deputy Director of the Funeral Preparation Bureau admitted, "Including South Africa, there were 164 countries participating in the funeral."

As the highest authority managing a country's diplomatic affairs, it is astonishing that such an error occurred, and the omitted country was South Africa, which was extremely isolated in the world due to its apartheid policy. The media insisted on getting a clear explanation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs began to contradict itself and could not provide a coherent explanation. Initially, they said that Japan and South Africa only had mutual recognition at the national level and no formal diplomatic relations, so they were not included in the count. By the night of the funeral, after re-evaluating the situation, they believed that having national recognition should be included in the count. Regarding this explanation, the *Asahi Shimbun* raised a counter-question: Why were Monaco and San Marino, which also have no formal diplomatic relations with Japan, included from the beginning? Subsequently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that South Africa was not invited by Japan but had voluntarily requested to participate. The South African side immediately refuted this, saying it was not true; South Africa was "invited by the Japanese government on January 9 to participate."

Strangely, such a major diplomatic matter was kept secret from the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister. On February 27, Prime Minister Takeshita and Foreign Minister Uno both met with reporters and expressed their ignorance of the South African representative's participation beforehand. Uno even said at a banquet on the 25th, hosted for African representatives attending the funeral, "Except for South Africa, all African countries attended the funeral." It seemed he was genuinely unaware of the situation. The *Chunichi Shimbun* editorial pointed out that this was inexplicable.

On February 28, Foreign Minister Uno summoned the Deputy Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Murata, and gave him a verbal warning regarding this "mistake." Murata apologized profusely. Thus, the blame was placed on Murata. Subsequently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that this mistake was due to technical reasons and had no other intentions. On the same day, the Director of the Middle East and Africa Bureau, at a reception attended by African diplomats in Tokyo, made two statements on behalf of the Foreign Minister. First, Japan could not refuse South Africa's request to participate. Second, Japan's firm opposition to South Africa's apartheid policy remained unchanged.

The matter seemed to be resolved. On March 1, many Japanese newspapers published editorials on this event, providing logical judgments.

Japan has performed poorly on the South African issue in the past. Due to trade issues with South Africa, it was criticized in the UN General Assembly in December of the previous year. Therefore, Japan had to hesitate when inviting South Africa. Publicly and formally inviting South Africa might lead to boycotts from African countries, causing the grand funeral plan to fail. Not inviting South Africa might offend this partner who brought economic benefits to Japan. Reluctantly, they chose to do it without saying it. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intended to keep this vague, but on the 26th, the Foreign Minister accidentally let it slip, revealing the secret and causing this uproar.

The *Asahi Shimbun* editorial on March 1 pointed out that although this incident was small, it raised doubts about the sincerity of Japan's diplomacy. The editorial demanded that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reflect on this matter.

　　天皇葬礼秘请南非
　  日外务省支吾其词
    本报讯  日本昭和天皇葬礼进行顺利，规模空前。这颇使日本当局得意了一阵子。但是两天之后，外务省突然透露参加葬礼的国家和地区是１６４个而不是早先正式公布的１６３个。日本新闻界对此穷追不舍。
    ２月２６日晚，宇野外相在总结葬礼外交时说，“有１６４个国家参加了葬礼，表现了世界对日本的友谊。”全世界的新闻媒介根据日本正式公布的数字都报道有１６３国参加葬礼，怎么又多一个？新闻记者紧急要求会见外务省官员。在记者追问下，外务省葬礼筹备总部事务局次官承认，“包括南非，共有１６４国参加葬礼。”
    作为掌管一国外交事务的最高当局竟出如此差错，漏掉的国家又偏偏是奉行种族隔离政策而在世界上极端孤立的南非。新闻界非要外务省说个明白不可。
    外务省前后矛盾，不能自圆的辩解开始了。先说日本和南非只有国家间承认，无正式外交关系，因此开始没有把它计算在内。到举行葬礼那天晚上，经重新研究，认为有国家间承认就应计算在内。对此说，《朝日新闻》提出了反诘：同样与日本无正式外交关系的摩纳哥、圣马力诺为何从一开始便计算在内呢？继而外务省又说，南非并非受到日本的邀请，而是主动要求参加的。南非方面当即反驳说这不是事实，南非是“在１月９日受到日本政府邀请才参加的”。
    奇怪的是，此等外交大事竟瞒过了首相和外相。竹下首相和宇野外相２７日会见记者时都表示事前不知有南非代表。宇野直至２５日在招待前来参加葬礼的非洲国家代表的宴会上还说，“除了南非，所有非洲国家都出席了葬礼。”仿佛他对此确实一无所知。《中日新闻》社论指出，这是不可思议的。
    ２月２８日，宇野外相召见了外务省事务次官村田，就此“失误”向他提出口头警告，村田道歉连声。就这样，帐被算到了村田头上。随后，外务省称，这个失误是技术上的原因，别无他意。同一天，外务省中东非洲局长在一次有非洲驻东京使节参加的招待会上奉外相之命，特意作了两点声明。第一，南非要来参加，日本不能拒绝。第二，日本坚决反对南非种族隔离的政策无丝毫改变。
    事情到此似乎就完了。３月１日，日本许多报纸就此发表社论，对这一事件做出了合乎逻辑的判断。
    日本过去在南非问题上表现不佳。因为同南非的贸易问题在去年１２月的联大上受过点名批评。因此，日本不得不在邀请南非问题上费些踌躇。公开正式邀请，恐怕会招致非洲国家抵制，使超级葬礼计划泡汤。如不邀请又担心会使这位给日本经济带来利益的伙伴不快。无奈，只好来个只做不说。外务省本想就此含糊下去，没想到外相２６日说走了嘴，天机泄露，引来了这场风波。
    《朝日新闻》３月１日社论指出，此事虽小，却使人怀疑日本外交的诚实性。社论要求外务省对此事做出反省。
