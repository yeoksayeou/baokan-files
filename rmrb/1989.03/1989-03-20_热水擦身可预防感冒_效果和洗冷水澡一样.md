A 90-year-old Soviet man's nearly 50 years of experience has proven that rubbing with hot water can strengthen the body and prevent colds, just like taking cold showers.

According to an article in the Soviet magazine "Family," taking cold showers or rubbing with cold water can enhance cold resistance. However, cold water exercises are not suitable for everyone, especially children and the weak. Konstantin Plekhanov, the elderly man, was weak when he was young and even dared not wash his face with cold water. However, he found that rubbing his face with hot water felt comfortable, so he started rubbing his entire body with hot water. For the past 50 years, he has never caught a cold.

Rubbing with hot water, like rubbing with cold water, can cause blood vessels to contract or expand, promoting blood circulation. Because hot water evaporates and takes away heat, the body must speed up blood circulation to replenish the lost heat.

The method of rubbing with hot water is very simple. Wet a towel with water that is not too hot, wring it out, and quickly rub the entire body with the hot towel. Initially, one can start by rubbing parts of the body and then dry off with a dry towel. Gradually increase the frequency of rubbing with hot water and expand it to the entire body. Eventually, one should be able to rub for 2 to 3 minutes.

### 热水擦身可预防感冒  效果和洗冷水澡一样

　　热水擦身可预防感冒  效果和洗冷水澡一样
    新华社莫斯科３月１４日电  苏联的一位９０岁老人近５０年的经验证明，用热水擦身也可像洗冷水澡一样锻炼身体，预防感冒等疾病。
    据苏联《家庭》周刊的文章说，洗冷水澡或用冷水擦身可锻炼耐寒能力。但用冷水锻炼不是所有的人都能享受的，特别是儿童和体弱者。这位名叫康斯坦丁·普列哈诺夫的老翁年轻时身体很弱，甚至不敢用冷水洗脸。可是他发现用热水擦脸后有舒适感，于是采用热水擦全身。此后５０年来他从未感冒过。
    用热水擦身同冷水擦身一样，都能促使血管收缩或扩张，促进血液循环。因为热水蒸发时也会带走热量，因此人体就得加快血液循环来补充热量。
    热水擦身的办法十分简单。用不烫手的水把毛巾弄湿，拧干，用热毛巾迅速擦遍全身。开始时，可先擦身体的局部，而且要用干毛巾擦干。渐渐地增加用热水擦身的次数并扩大到全身。最后要做到擦身的时间达到２至３分钟。
