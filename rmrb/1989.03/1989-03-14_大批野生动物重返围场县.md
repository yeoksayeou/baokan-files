Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, March 13th.

Large numbers of wild animals have returned to Weichang County, Hebei Province, due to the significant increase in forest greening areas. Recently, relevant departments have discovered that there are tens of thousands of wild boars and roe deer, thousands of elk, as well as white storks and swans. People have also spotted golden cats and lynxes, which were previously thought to be extinct.

Located in the northern part of the Great Wall, Weichang was once the imperial hunting ground during the Qing Dynasty. In recent years, the county has actively engaged in the construction of the "Three-North" shelterbelt, the capital's surrounding greening project, and other initiatives. The total forest area has reached 4.46 million mu, with a forest coverage rate of 32.9%.

　　大批野生动物重返围场县
    据新华社石家庄３月１３日电  河北省围场县由于森林绿化面积大幅度增加，引来许多珍禽异兽。最近有关部门考察发现，这里已有数以万计的野猪、狍子，数千匹马鹿，还有白鹳、天鹅。人们还发现了早已绝迹的金钱豹、猞猁。
    地处塞北坝上地区的围场曾是清代皇家猎苑。近几年来，这个县积极从事“三北”防护林、首都周围绿化工程等建设，总有林面积已达４４６万多亩，森林覆盖率达３２．９％。
