	In the first issue of 1988 of the "Academic Research" magazine, the "Political Culture" discussion column published an article titled "The Poverty and Development of China's Political Culture" by young scholar Xu Wanmin. The article points out that in the study of political system reform, a fundamental link that is often overlooked by people—the cultivation and construction of political culture—must be given high attention. In China, which has a long history of feudal culture, the influence of feudal monarchical political culture is deep, making the development of modern democratic political culture fraught with difficulties.

	He proposes that in modern political science, political culture is generally divided into three categories: (1) primitive regional political culture; (2) feudal oppressive political culture; (3) modern participatory political culture. Since the founding of the nation, our criticism of oppressive political culture has not been very effective, and we have also not paid much attention to cultivating the participatory political culture that truly reflects the essence of socialism. Therefore, the construction of socialist political culture is basically in a passive state. Due to the excessive emphasis on centralization and unified leadership, the oppressive political culture centered on the worship of feudal monarchical power was once strengthened. Today, when we begin to consider political system reform, people still habitually view the operating mechanism and efficiency of political entities as the sole task of reform, while seriously neglecting the construction of political culture and the improvement of the political cultural environment. This political cultural apathy may make political system reform difficult to proceed.

　　徐万珉认为：
    政治体制改革要重视政治文化建设
    一九八八年第一期《学术研究》杂志的“政治文化”讨论专栏，发表青年学者徐万珉撰写的《我国政治文化的贫困与发展》文章中指出，在政治体制改革的研究中，普遍为人们所忽视的一个基础环节——政治文化的培育和建设，必须引起高度重视。在具有长期封建文化传统的中国，封建王权政治文化的影响很深，使近代民主政治文化的发育困难重重。
    他提出：现代政治学中把政治文化大体分为三类：（一）原始地区性政治文化；（二）封建奴役型政治文化；（三）现代参与型政治文化。建国以来，我们对于奴役型政治文化的批判成效不大，而对真正反映社会主义本质的参与型政治文化的培育也着力不多。因此，社会主义政治文化的建设基本处于被动状态。由于过分强调集权和一元化领导，使封建王权崇拜为中心的奴役型政治文化一度强化，今天，我们开始考虑政治体制改革时，人们在意识上仍习惯地把政治实体的运行机制和效率看成是政改的唯一任务，而严重忽视政治文化的建设和政治文化环境的改善，这种政治文化的冷漠症很可能使政治体制改革步履艰难。
