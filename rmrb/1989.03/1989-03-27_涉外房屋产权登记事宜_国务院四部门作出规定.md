The Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the State Council's Office for Overseas Chinese Affairs have recently jointly issued a notice, providing specific regulations for the registration of real estate ownership involving overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, Taiwanese compatriots, and foreigners within the territory of China.

It is understood that since 1987, when China began the work of urban real estate ownership registration and certification, the number of overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, Taiwanese compatriots, foreign Chinese, and foreigners coming to handle real estate ownership registration, transfer, and inheritance matters has been increasing. To confirm the validity of the notarized documents provided by the aforementioned individuals, the notice stipulates that overseas Chinese and foreign Chinese residing in countries with diplomatic relations with China can have their notarization or certification handled at the Chinese embassy or consulate in that country. For overseas Chinese, foreign Chinese, and foreigners residing in countries with diplomatic relations with China, notarized documents issued by local notaries must be jointly certified by the foreign affairs department or its authorized agency of that country and the Chinese embassy or consulate. For overseas Chinese and foreign Chinese handling notarization in countries without diplomatic relations with China, the principle is that the notarized documents must be certified by the foreign affairs department of that country and the embassy or consulate of a third country that has diplomatic relations with both that country and China. If overseas Chinese and foreign Chinese find it difficult to handle these procedures, they can request the overseas Chinese affairs department at or above the county level in the location of the real estate to issue a certificate based on the information they have. For Hong Kong compatriots, notarized documents can be handled by lawyers commissioned by the Ministry of Justice in Hong Kong. Institutions and organizations such as Nam Kwong Company, Nam Kwong (Group) Limited, the Bank of China Macao Branch, the General Union of Macao Workers, the Chinese Education Association of Macao, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Macao, and the Macao Federation of Neighborhood Associations can provide certification documents for their staff and members.

For notarized documents issued by Taiwanese compatriots in Taiwan, mainland real estate management authorities can use them as reference and handle the matter according to the specific circumstances of the real estate.

The notice also stipulates that the inheritance of real estate within China by overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, Taiwanese compatriots, foreign Chinese, and foreigners shall be handled in accordance with the laws of China.

　　涉外房屋产权登记事宜       
    国务院四部门作出规定
    新华社北京３月２５日电  （记者赵明亮）司法部、建设部、外交部和国务院侨务办公室新近联合发出通知，对办理华侨、港澳同胞、台湾同胞以及外国人在我国境内的房屋产权登记事宜作出了具体规定。
    据了解，自１９８７年我国开始进行城镇房屋所有权登记发证工作以来，华侨、港澳台同胞、外籍华人以及外国人前来办理房产权登记、转移和继承等事项不断增多。为了确认上述人员提供的公证文书效力，《通知》规定，居住在与我国有外交关系国家的华侨、外籍华人，可在我国驻该国使（领）馆办理公证或认证证明；居住在与我国有外交关系国家的华侨、外籍华人及外国人提供的当地公证人出具的公证文书，须经该国外交部或其授权机构与我国使（领）馆共同认证。华侨、外籍华人及外国人在与我国无外交关系的国家办理的公证文书，原则上需经该国外交部及该国和我国均有外交关系的第三国的使（领）馆认证；如华侨、外籍华人办理这些手续确有困难，可请求房产所在地的县以上侨务部门根据所掌握的情况出具证明。香港同胞所需公证文书可由我国司法部在当地委托的律师办理。澳门南光公司、澳门南光（集团）有限公司、中国银行澳门分行及澳门工会联合总会、澳门中华教育会、澳门中华总商会、澳门街坊会联合会等机构、社团，都可为本机构、社团工作人员和会员提供证明文书。
    对台湾同胞在台湾公证机关办理的公证文书，内地房地产管理机关可作为参考，视该项房产的具体情况予以办理。
    《通知》还规定，华侨、港澳同胞、台湾同胞、外籍华人以及外国人继承在我国内的房产，按照我国的法律规定办理。
