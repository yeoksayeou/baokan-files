Last November, from the 14th to the 19th, I went to Shijiazhuang on business. At the Shijiazhuang People's Department Store, I bought a high-grade bedspread produced by the Jiangsu Danyang Embroidery Factory, priced at 169 yuan. At that time, I did not ask the salesperson for a receipt. When I got home and tried it, I found that the bedspread was not long enough. I was really troubled. If I returned it, I was afraid the store would not accept it without a receipt; if I tried to give it away, no one would want it because of the wrong size. So, with a bit of hope, I wrote a letter to the leadership of the Shijiazhuang People's Department Store, hoping to exchange it for a two-meter-long bedspread. To my surprise, I quickly received a reply from the store's leadership. The letter said that all the bedspreads in the store were less than two meters long, and they asked me to send the bedspread back so they could refund my money. After I sent the bedspread, in less than half a month, I received the refund from the Shijiazhuang People's Department Store. The wholehearted service spirit of the Shijiazhuang People's Department Store deeply moved me.

### 一条床罩见精神

　　一条床罩见精神
    去年十一月十四日至十九日，我去石家庄出差，在石家庄人民商场买了一条江苏丹阳绣品厂生产的高级床罩，价格一百六十九元。当时，我没有向售货员要发票，回家后一试，发现这条床罩不够长。我真是烦恼透了。退货吧，怕没有发票商店不承认；转让吧，因尺寸不合适，没人要。于是，我抱着试试看的心情，给石家庄人民商场领导人写了一封信，希望换一条两米长的床罩。没想到，我很快就收到了商场领导人的回信。信中说，商场内的床罩都不足两米长，让我将床罩寄回，再将钱退还我。我把床罩寄出后，不到半个月，就收到了石家庄人民商场的退款。石家庄人民商场全心全意为顾客服务的精神，使我深受感动。
