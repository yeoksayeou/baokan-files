	The Contrast Between One Yuan and Eight Yuan
	— A Record of a Farmer Representative's Political Discussions

	By Duan Cunchang, People's Daily Reporter

	In the Great Hall of the People, 5th row, 22nd seat, sat a farmer representative. His name is Wang Keming, 37 years old, a farmer from Shangli Village, Jianning County, Fujian Province. His family of 11 people cultivates 182 mu of grain fields, and over 7 years, they have sold 415,000 kilograms of grain to the state. This year, he also attended the national grain sales champion commendation meeting. After listening to the government work report, he shared his thoughts with the reporter:

	I carefully listened to Premier Li Peng's government work report. Every aspect is very important, especially the part about agriculture. Our country is so large; we cannot overlook agriculture!

	"The State Council has decided that starting from April 1st this year, the procurement price for contracted grain will be increased by an average of 18% to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for increasing grain and cotton production..." This part I listened to especially carefully. Farmers are very sensitive to grain prices; prices directly affect the producers' mood. I did some calculations myself:

	Income from selling grain. My family's annual grain procurement task is 50,000 kilograms. Last year, the procurement price was 45.6 yuan per 100 kilograms, and this year, after the local grain price adjustment, it is 46.6 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan, totaling an additional income of 500 yuan.

	Expenditure on buying fertilizer. My family buys 14,000 kilograms of state-subsidized fertilizer annually. Last year, the price was 26.7 yuan per 100 kilograms, and this year it has increased to 35 yuan, an increase of 8.3 yuan, totaling an additional expenditure of 1,162 yuan.

	Comparing the income from selling grain with the expenditure on buying fertilizer, just this item alone, I lose six or seven hundred yuan. If we add the price increases for pesticides, seeds, machinery parts, and hired labor, the contrast is even greater. Farmers really can't take it anymore. I want to say, to ensure a good grain harvest this year, the most important thing is to rationalize prices.

　　一元与八元的反差        
    ——一位种田代表议政录
    本报记者  段存章
    在人大会堂５排２２号上，坐着一位农民代表，他叫王克明，３７岁，福建省建宁县上里村农民，全家１１口人，耕种粮田１８２亩，７年售给国家粮食４１．５万公斤，今年还出席了全国售粮大户表彰会。听完政府工作报告，他向记者倾诉了心里话：
    我细心听了李鹏总理政府工作报告，方方面面挺重要，特别是讲到农业。国家这么大，不看重农业不行呀！
    “为了调动农民增产粮食和棉花的积极性，国务院决定从今年４月１日起，将合同定购粮食的收购价格平均提高１８％……”，这段话我听得更入耳。我们农民对粮食价格最敏感，价格直接关系着生产者的情绪。我自己算了两笔账：
    卖粮收入账。我家全年粮食定购任务５万公斤，去年每百公斤收购价４５．６元，今年当地粮食调价后为４６．６元，增加１元，总共增收５００元。
    买化肥开支账。我家全年购买国家平价化肥１．４万公斤，去年每百公斤化肥售价２６．７元，今年涨到３５元，增加８．３元，总共增加开支１１６２元。
    卖粮与买肥比，光这一项，我亏损六七百元。要是加上农药、种子、机械配件、雇工的涨价，反差更大，种田人实在受不了。我想说句话，争取今年粮食有个好收成，理顺价格最重要。
