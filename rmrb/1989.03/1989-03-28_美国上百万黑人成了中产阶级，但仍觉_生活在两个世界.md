Over the past 20 years, the United States has undergone a transformation that has affected the entire society: the rise of the black middle class. Millions of black Americans have reached the economic income, cultural education, and lifestyle standards of the general American middle class.

Today, the number of black Americans working as managers and in professional and technical positions in enterprises has increased by 52% compared to 10 years ago. One-third of black households have an annual income exceeding $35,000. Black Americans have become CEOs or general managers in companies and stores that once excluded them; they have become mayors or members of Congress in districts where they once had no voting rights; they have moved into high-end suburban homes that were once off-limits to blacks, living alongside whites...

Undeniably, these are significant advancements in American society. However, black middle-class individuals often feel that they are still "living in two worlds": one where their education and talent are the standards, and another where skin color still seems to determine everything.

Jalopin Gilbert is an exceptional black individual. He graduated from Harvard University and is currently the vice president of the National Broadcasting Company. In 1988, he represented the company in negotiations for Olympic broadcasting rights. However, his career success does not solve everyday problems like hailing a taxi. One night, he had to rush to the airport for a flight due to work, standing at a busy intersection and flagging down several taxis, all of which ignored him. Finally, he had to call his secretary for help. The secretary effortlessly hailed the first taxi that passed by. The reason was simple: the secretary was white, while the boss had black skin.

New York City's black deputy mayor, Stanley Glasson, and his wife have an annual income of $200,000. Eight years ago, they moved into a high-end apartment in the suburbs. To this day, he is often deliberately left out in the elevator lobby by whites, clearly mistaking this distinguished black man for a criminal. His wife often encounters whites in the laundry room asking if she would like to work as a maid, as if her skin color was only fit for taking orders.

Currently, for the black middle class, employment problems have been solved, but in terms of promotions or salary treatment, they encounter unequal treatment. Black youth, through their own efforts, have entered higher education institutions, but in terms of receiving scholarships, they are not treated equally with white students. When blacks apply for credit at banks, they often see cold faces from bank employees; security personnel in large department stores always cast suspicious glances at black customers, treating them as potential thieves...

These more subtle forms of discrimination are conditioned reflexes stemming from prejudice against dark skin. Some whites believe that ideal living environments, top-tier schools, and first-class entertainment venues are their "exclusive rights," and that integrating a few blacks into the white community is merely a decoration that should not exceed the "limit." There are also admirers of the "white supremacy" ideology who believe that whites are superior to blacks and that blacks are incapable of leading whites. The American slang, "even white people's ice is colder than others," perhaps reflects this mindset.

The rise of the black middle class has also had an impact on black American society. They have moved en masse out of black ghettos, while those left in the city centers face a vicious cycle in all aspects. Some blacks are concerned that the black middle class will be assimilated by whites, and that black cultural heritage will have no one to inherit. Therefore, they advocate for improving black traditional schools, allowing black children to learn their own cultural heritage. Many people have donated money to improve the teaching conditions in black schools. Some advocate for black entrepreneurs to establish and develop black conglomerates, providing more job opportunities for blacks.

### 美国上百万黑人成了中产阶级，但仍觉  生活在两个世界

　　美国上百万黑人成了中产阶级，但仍觉        
    生活在两个世界
    过去２０年里，美国进行了一场范围波及整个社会的变革：黑人中产阶级兴起，上百万黑人在经济收入、文化教育水平、生活方式等方面达到了美国一般中产阶级水平。
    今天，美国黑人在企业当经理和从事专业技术的人数比１０年前增加了５２％，有１／３的黑人家庭年收入超过了３．５万美元。黑人在曾把他们拒之门外的公司和商店里，成了总裁或总经理；在过去连选举权都没有的选区，当了市长或国会议员；住进了过去不准黑人进入的市郊高级住宅区，与白人为邻……
    无可否认，这些是美国社会的一大进步。然而，黑人中产阶级总感到他们还是“生活在两个世界”里：一个是以他们的学历、才华为衡量标准；而在另一个世界里肤色则似乎仍决定了一切。
    贾洛平·吉尔贝特算是出类拔萃的黑人，他毕业于哈佛大学，现任全国广播公司副总裁，１９８８年代表公司参加了奥运会广播权的谈判。不过，他事业上的成功却解决不了日常生活中像叫一辆出租汽车的小事。一天深夜，他因公务要赶往机场乘飞机，站在交通要道一连招呼好几辆出租汽车，均遭白眼。最后，他不得不打电话求助于他的女秘书。秘书毫不费力在路边叫住了开过来的第一辆出租汽车。原因很简单：秘书是白人，老板却是黑皮肤。
    纽约市黑人副市长斯坦雷·格拉松和他的夫人年收入２０万美元，８年前，搬进市郊一所高级公寓。至今，他还常在电梯口被白人有意关在门外，显然，这位尊贵的黑人被当成歹徒了。他的妻子在洗衣房，常常碰到白人问她是否愿意当女佣，似乎她的肤色只配听人使唤。
    目前，对黑人中产阶级来说，就业问题虽解决了，但在职位晋升或工资待遇上，却碰到不平等待遇；黑人青年凭自己努力虽进入了高等学府，但在享受奖学金的问题上，却不能与白人学生同等相待；黑人去银行申请信贷，常看到银行职员冷冰冰的脸；大商店的保安人员总对黑人顾客投以怀疑的目光，把他们当成“梁上君子”……
    诸种更隐蔽的歧视是对黑皮肤带有偏见的条件反射。有的白人认为理想的居住环境、上等的学校、第一流的娱乐场所都是他们的“专利”，吸收少数黑人进入白人生活圈子只不过是一种点缀，不能超过“极限”。还有“白人至上”思想的崇拜者认为白人都比黑人强，黑人无能力领导白人。美国俚语：“白人的冰也比别人的凉”也许正反映了这种心态。
    黑人中产阶级的兴起对美国黑人社会也产生一定影响。他们大批离开了黑人集居区，而留在市中心的黑人的各方面条件形成恶性循环。有的黑人担心，黑人中产阶级会被白人同化，而黑人的民族文化遗产无人继承。因此，他们主张办好黑人的传统学校，让黑人孩子学习本民族的文化遗产。不少人纷纷捐款资助改善黑人学校的教学条件。还有人主张黑人企业家创办和发展黑人财团，给更多黑人以就业的机会。
