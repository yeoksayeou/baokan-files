Title: The Fate of the Strategic Defense Initiative

Since Bush took office, American public opinion has been abuzz with discussions about the fate of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). Some newspapers have even compared the "Strategic Defense Initiative," which was highly valued by former President Reagan, to the "Emperor's New Clothes," saying, "The emperor has stepped down, and finally someone has spoken the truth." According to the American press, the Bush administration is considering making significant changes to the plan, shifting the focus to developing a smaller-scale, limited-target missile defense system, or what is called the "Accidental Launch Protection System" (ALPS), which aims to intercept a batch of nuclear warheads mistakenly launched at the United States.

Since the SDI was officially proposed in March 1983, the Reagan administration has invested a tremendous amount of manpower and resources into it, with research and development costs alone reaching $16 billion. In the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms reduction talks, it became a focal point of contention between the two countries. During the intermediate-range missile talks, both sides engaged in lengthy negotiations over the SDI issue. Eventually, the Soviet side made concessions, agreeing to negotiate the intermediate-range missile issue separately from the SDI, and the United States also made a commitment not to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in the next 15 years, limiting the SDI to laboratory research. Thus, the intermediate-range missile agreement was signed.

Regarding the SDI, which the Reagan administration had tenaciously pursued, the new Bush administration has faced calls for significant modifications upon taking office, a move that is quite intriguing.

From an external perspective, the current international situation is vastly different from six years ago when the SDI was proposed. The U.S.-Soviet intermediate-range missile treaty has been signed and implemented, East-West relations have eased, and both the U.S. and the Soviet Union, while maintaining strategic parity, are increasingly focused on competing in comprehensive national power. Regional conflicts are also moving towards political resolution. In this international context, if the U.S. government still attempts to pressure the Soviet Union with the SDI and use it to engage the Soviet Union in a high-level arms race, it would be both inappropriate and ineffective.

Furthermore, the Bush administration faces domestic economic challenges. Huge fiscal deficits, trade deficits, and enormous debts are the primary issues Bush must address. The balanced budget bill passed by Congress also requires the president to eliminate the deficit by 1991. Of the three major expenditures in the U.S. budget, the first is military spending, which will be the first to be cut. In this situation, it is inevitable for the Bush administration to make certain adjustments to the resource-intensive SDI, reducing and delaying the testing and deployment of some projects.

Additionally, from a technological standpoint, while the SDI has made some progress, it still faces numerous problems that are difficult to solve in the short term. The U.S. Congress's Office of Technology Assessment has pointed out that the detailed computer instructions needed to destroy tens of thousands of nuclear warheads heading towards the United States are unlikely to be developed in the "foreseeable future." Moreover, sending a large amount of equipment into different orbital heights requires thousands of space shuttle flights, which is far from easy.

Given these realities, the new U.S. administration's advisors, after careful consideration, have focused on a smaller, more practical "Accidental Launch Protection System," changing the defense scope from "comprehensive" to "limited," and the defense means from primarily space-based directed energy interceptors to primarily land-based weapons, which is entirely possible.

However, to say that the Bush administration will completely abandon the SDI seems somewhat unrealistic. This is because the implementation of the SDI is closely related to the fundamental interests of many large defense and military-industrial complexes and enterprises in the United States. At the same time, the United States also hopes to drive the development of the entire scientific and technological sector through the SDI, thereby enhancing the United States' comprehensive national power. Therefore, it is likely that the effective parts will continue to be utilized. From the SDI to the Accidental Launch Protection System, this reflects a new trend in the Bush administration's consideration of defense adjustments: continuing to maintain deterrent power, but with more practical, flexible, and cost-effective approaches.

### 战略防御计划的命运

　　战略防御计划的命运
    李文云
    布什上台后，美国舆论界对战略防御计划（ＳＤＩ）的命运议论纷纷，有的报纸甚至把被前总统里根奉若至宝的“战略防御计划”比作“皇帝的新衣”，说“皇帝下台了，终于有人说出了真相。”据美国报界透露，布什政府正在考虑对该计划作一些重大修改，将把重点转向发展一种规模较小、目标有限的导弹防御系统，或称为“意外发射保护系统”（ＡＬＰＳ），意为击落“错误地射向美国”的一批核弹头。
    战略防御计划自１９８３年３月正式提出后，里根政府已为此花费大量人力财力，仅研制费就达１６０亿美元。在美苏核裁军谈判中，它曾成了两国争论的焦点。在中导谈判过程中，双方在战略防御计划问题上曾进行长时间的讨价还价，最后苏方作出让步，同意中导谈判不与战略防御计划挂钩，单独予以谈判；同时美国也作出承诺，在今后１５年内不退出反弹道导弹条约，把战略防御计划限制在实验室范围内。这样，中导协议才得以签字。
    对里根政府苦苦坚持的战略防御计划，布什新政府一上台就有舆论提出要对其作重大修改，此举颇为耐人寻味。
    从外部原因看，当前的国际局势与６年前战略防御计划提出时已大不相同。美苏中导条约签字生效，东西方关系趋于缓和，美苏双方在保持战略均势的同时，更加注重综合国力的竞争，地区性冲突也朝着政治解决的方向发展。在这样的国际背景下，美国政府如果还想以战略防御计划来压苏联，并以此拖住苏联同它进行高水平的军备竞赛，既不合时宜，似乎也难以奏效。
    其次，布什政府面临国内经济难题。庞大的财政赤字、外贸赤字和巨额债务，是布什要解决的首要问题。国会通过的平衡预算法案，也要求总统在１９９１年消除赤字。美国财政的三大开支项目，第一项就是军费，要削减财政开支，军费首当其冲。在这种情况下，布什政府对耗资巨大的战略防御计划作某些调整，减少和推迟某些项目的试验与部署，势在必行。
    此外，在技术方面，战略防御计划虽然取得了一些进展，但仍存在大量短时期内难以解决的问题。美国国会技术评估局就指出，要摧毁向美国飞来的成千上万核弹头所需的详尽计算机指令，恐怕在“可预见的将来”研制不出来。同时，要把大量设备送入不同高度的空间轨道，需要航天飞机上千次的飞行，更是谈何容易。
    基于这种现实，美国新政府的谋士们经过衡量，把注意力集中于规模较小、又实际可行的“意外发射保护系统”，将防护范围从“全面”改为“有限”，防御手段也从以天基定向能拦截器为主，改为以陆基武器为主，完全是有可能的。
    不过，要说布什政府完全放弃战略防御计划，似乎也不大符合实情。这是因为，战略防御计划执行与否，关系到美国国防、军火工业许多大财团和企业的根本利益；同时，美国还期望通过战略防御计划来推动整个科技事业的发展，借以增强美国的综合国力。因此很可能会继续利用其中的有效部分。从战略防御计划到意外发射保护系统，反映了布什政府考虑调整防务的一种新趋向：继续保持威慑力量，但做法将更加务实，更加灵活，更加追求效益。
