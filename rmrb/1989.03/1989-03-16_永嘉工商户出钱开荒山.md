The town of Qiaotou in Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province, known as the "Eastern First Button Market," actively supports local merchants in investing in development-oriented agricultural production.

Over the past four years, more than 300 prominent merchants in the town have invested a total of 600,000 yuan. They have formed 76 joint ventures with farmers, reclaiming 12,000 mu of wasteland. They have planted 617,000 fruit trees and timber trees, reversing the previous trend of industrial and commercial development at the expense of agriculture.
