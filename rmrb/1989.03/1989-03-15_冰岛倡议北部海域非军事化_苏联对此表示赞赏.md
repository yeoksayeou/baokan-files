Iceland has proposed convening an international conference to discuss naval forces in the North Atlantic and the eventual demilitarization of the northern seas. The Soviet Union has expressed its appreciation for this initiative.

The proposal was made by Iceland's Finance Minister Grímsson at a meeting in Oslo, which included representatives from the Nordic countries, the Soviet Union, and the United States, to discuss security issues in the Nordic region.

Tass news agency reported today that this initiative reflects the growing interest of the Nordic people in strengthening security, trust, and military-political stability in the region.

A Soviet Foreign Ministry official told a Tass reporter that the conference proposed by the Icelandic government should include all relevant countries, including the United States. The Soviet side also expressed its readiness to make a positive contribution to resolving this issue.
