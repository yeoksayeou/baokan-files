	Anyone who has been to Bulgaria is sure to be impressed by the ubiquitous trees and forests in this country. From the Balkan Mountains to the Black Sea coast, from the banks of the Danube to the Rhodope Hills, everywhere is lush and vibrant.

	Historically, Bulgaria has been a country with few forests. Before the war, the forest coverage rate of the country was 9%, ranking second to last among European countries. After the establishment of the republic in 1944, the forest area has been continuously expanding. Currently, the total forest volume in the country has reached 3.9 million hectares, with a coverage rate of 35%, ranking fourth in Europe. The remarkable achievements of Bulgaria's forestry industry are largely due to scientific afforestation and the development of intensive forestry.

	In the early days of the country's founding, Bulgaria organized a large number of forestry scientists to conduct a comprehensive survey of the country's forest resources, soil, climate, and ecological conditions. After scientific verification, a forestry development plan was proposed to rationally cultivate three major forest systems. These are: cultivating economic forests in mountainous and hilly areas to primarily provide timber; cultivating ecological forests around cities, factories, and tourist scenic areas to maintain ecological balance and beautify the environment; and cultivating protective forests along the coasts, rivers, lakes, and reservoirs to prevent soil erosion and natural disasters such as wind, sand, drought, and flooding. The three types of forests need to maintain a scientific development ratio. Economic forests account for 80% of the total forest area, ecological forests account for 15%, and protective forests account for 5%.

	To accelerate the cultivation of the three major forest systems, Bulgaria practices intensive afforestation. The country has established 8 fast-growing, high-yield forest bases. Concentrating manpower, funds, and technological means, "cultivating carefully," and scientifically managing, the survival rate of young forests has increased from 60% to 92%, and the time for trees to mature has been shortened by half. Currently, fast-growing, high-yield forests account for 30% of the country's total forest area, and timber production accounts for 40%.

	Engineering afforestation is another characteristic of the development of intensive forestry. Bulgaria's approach is to formulate scientific construction plans and use advanced technologies such as aerial seeding and tree-planting machines to cultivate young forests over large areas.

	Good tree species and seedlings are the foundation for optimizing forests. For this reason, Bulgaria has established a tree species research and breeding center to manage the supply of tree species nationwide. Its seed bank stores more than 2,000 selected excellent tree species. Nurseries and greenhouses can cultivate more than 600 million tree seedlings annually for afforestation.

	Bulgaria takes measures to enhance the forest's ability to resist pollution. For example, it applies magnesium lime powder and liquid fertilizers to trees. Research institutions are also strengthening the research and breeding of pollution-resistant tree species.

	In the prevention and control of forest pests and diseases, Bulgaria adopts a comprehensive approach that combines chemical agents with biological pest control. To reduce the adverse effects of toxic chemicals on forests, low-toxicity Sevin powder, which dissolves quickly, is used. When applying pesticides, the use of contact killing methods is minimized, and fumigation methods are mainly used.

	Bulgaria places great importance on forest fire prevention. In addition to establishing electronic monitoring devices and regular patrols by forest fire aircraft in major forest areas, a "green telephone" is installed at regular intervals. The public can report fires to relevant departments in a timely manner when they discover them.

	Scientific management and operation methods have brought vitality to Bulgaria's forestry industry.

    保加利亚的森林覆盖率由战前的百分之九上升到今天的百分之三十五，跃居欧洲第四位。其成功的重要经验——
    依靠科学手段集约造林
    郭春晓
    保加利亚　凡到过保加利亚的人，无不对这个国家举目皆是的树木森林留下深刻的印象。从巴尔干山到黑海之滨，从多瑙河畔到罗多彼丘陵，到处郁郁葱葱，生机盎然。
    保加利亚在历史上是一个少林国家。战前国土的森林覆盖率为９％，在欧洲国家中处于倒数第二位。１９４４年共和国成立后，森林面积不断扩大。目前，全国森林总储量已达３９０万公顷，覆盖率上升到３５％，在欧洲名列第四。保加利亚林业能取得令人瞩目的成就，一个重要的原因就是科学育林，发展集约化大林业。
    建国初期，保加利亚组织了一大批林业科学家对全国的森林资源及土壤、气候和生态条件进行普查，经科学论证，提出了合理营造三大林系的林业发展方案。这就是：在山区、丘陵地带营造以提供木材为主的经济林；在城市、厂矿周围及旅游风景区营造维持生态平衡和美化环境的生态林；在海滨和江、河、湖泊及水库沿岸营造防止水土流失和风、沙、旱、涝等自然灾害的防护林。三类森林需保持科学的发展比例。经济林占森林总量的８０％，生态林占１５％，防护林占５％。
    为加速营造三大林系，保加利亚实行集约化育林。全国建立了８个速生丰产林基地。集中人力、资金和技术手段，“精耕细作”，科学管理，使幼林成活率一下子由６０％提高到９２％，树木成材周期缩短了一半。目前，速生丰产林已占全国森林总量的３０％，木材产量占４０％。
    工程育林是发展集约化林业的另一特点。保加利亚的做法是，制定科学的施工方案，采用飞机播种和植树机栽插等先进技术手段，大面积营造幼林。
    好的树种和苗木是优化森林的基础。为此，保加利亚专门成立了树种研究培育中心，统管全国的树种供应工作。它的种子库储存着２０００多种经过筛选的优良树种。苗圃和暖房每年能培育６亿多株树苗供造林使用。
    保加利亚注意采取措施增强森林的抗污染能力。如给树木施用含镁石灰粉和液体肥料等。科研机构也在加强抗污染树种的研究和培育工作。
    在防治森林病虫害方面，保加利亚实行化学药剂与生物灭虫相结合的综合防治办法。为减少含毒药物对森林产生的副作用，使用能快速溶解的低毒西维因粉剂，施药时较少采用触杀方式，而多采用熏蒸方式。
    保加利亚十分重视森林防火工作。各大林区除设立了电子监视装置，森林火警飞机定期巡逻外，每隔一定距离就设有一部“绿色电话”。群众发现火情，可及时向有关部门报告。
    科学的经营和管理方法给保加利亚林业带来了勃勃生机。
