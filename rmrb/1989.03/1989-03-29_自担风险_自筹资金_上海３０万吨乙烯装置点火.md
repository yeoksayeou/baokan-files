People's Daily, Shanghai, March 28th.

The 300,000-ton ethylene unit at the Shanghai Jinshan Petrochemical Complex, funded both domestically and internationally, was successfully ignited today after 22 months of construction by a large number of builders.

In addition to the 300,000-ton ethylene unit, the Shanghai 300,000-ton ethylene project also includes four production units: 120,000 tons of ethylene oxide/ethylene glycol, 70,000 tons of polypropylene, and 250,000 tons of atmospheric and vacuum distillation. The total investment is 1.962 billion yuan. After the project is completed and put into production, along with the 115,000-ton ethylene unit at the Shanghai Jinshan Petrochemical Complex after renovation, the annual ethylene production will reach approximately 450,000 tons.

During the construction of the Shanghai 300,000-ton ethylene project, there were serious difficulties in funding and raw materials. The builders overcame these challenges by raising funds through multiple channels. Through the Shanghai Construction Bank, two loans totaling $288 million were obtained from an international consortium, the enterprise issued 235 million yuan in bonds, and the factory's 60,000 employees raised 11 million yuan, collectively overcoming the funding shortage.

The Shanghai 300,000-ton ethylene project is scheduled to commence full-scale trial production in April next year.

    上海３０万吨乙烯装置点火
    本报上海３月２８日电  本报记者萧关根、中央人民广播电台记者吴龙关报道：由国内外集资建设的上海金山石化总厂３０万吨乙烷装置经过广大建设者２２个月的建设，今天一次点火成功。
    上海３０万吨乙烯工程除了３０万吨乙烯装置以外，还包括１２万吨环氧乙烷／乙二醇、７万吨聚丙烯和２５０万吨常减压等四套生产装置。总投资达１９．６２亿元。工程建成投产后，加上上海金山石化总厂原有的１１．５万吨乙烯装置经过改造，乙烯年总产量将达到４５万吨左右。
    上海３０万吨乙烯工程建设中，遇到了资金和原材料短缺的严重困难。广大工程建设者克服困难，多渠道集资，通过上海建设银行先后两次向国际银团贷款共２．８８亿美元，企业发行债券２．３５亿元人民币，本厂六万职工集资１１００万元人民币，共度资金短缺难关。
    上海３０万吨乙烯工程将于明年４月全面投料试生产。
