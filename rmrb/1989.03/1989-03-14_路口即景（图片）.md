	Scene at the Crossroads
	Even with green and red lights,
	It's hard to stop the reckless driving.
	Forced to desperate measures,
	A rope is used to control traffic.
	It's a pity, with good intentions,
	But management skills are lacking.
	Crossroads are a matter of life and death,
	Advice to drivers: don't be a hero.
	Photographed at a crossroads in the urban area of Shantou, Guangdong.

    路口即景
    纵有灯绿灯红，
    难禁直撞横冲。
    逼得无可奈何，
    牵绳来管交通。
    可叹苦心一片，
    只缘管理技穷。
    路口性命交关，
    劝君莫逞英雄。
    摄于广东汕头市区十字街头。
