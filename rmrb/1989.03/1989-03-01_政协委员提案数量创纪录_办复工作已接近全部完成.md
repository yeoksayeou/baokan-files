The work of replying to proposals submitted by members of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is nearing completion. By the end of February, 1,982 out of 2,005 proposals submitted by members have been replied to, accounting for 98.85 percent.

It is reported that the number of proposals submitted by members during the Seventh National Committee of the CPPCC is the highest in the history of CPPCC meetings. The difficulty in handling these proposals has also increased to a certain extent. A total of 161 units participated in the work of handling the proposals, of which 142 units have completed their tasks, accounting for 88 percent. There are still 23 proposals that have not been replied to, and the CPPCC Proposals Office is actively working with relevant units to handle them.
