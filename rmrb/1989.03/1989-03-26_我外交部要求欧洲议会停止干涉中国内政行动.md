Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 25th.

	China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently demanded through diplomatic channels that the European Parliament immediately cease all actions interfering in China's internal affairs.

	In recent days, a responsible official from the Ministry's Western Europe Division summoned the Spanish Ambassador to China, representing the chair country of the European Council, and the Head of the European Commission's mission to China. They expressed strong indignation and deep regret over the European Parliament's passage of a resolution interfering in China's internal affairs under the guise of "human rights in Tibet." They strongly demanded that the European Parliament immediately cease all actions interfering in China's internal affairs to ensure that bilateral relations can develop along a healthy track.

	Subsequently, the responsible official from the Western Europe Division, at the request, met with the Spanish Ambassador to China, representing the current chair country of the European Council, the Ambassadors from the previous and next chair countries, and the Head of the European Commission's mission to China. They listened to the positions of the governments of the twelve European Community countries as conveyed by them. The responsible official from the Western Europe Division reiterated that Tibet's affairs are purely China's internal affairs and do not allow any foreign government or organization to interfere under any pretext.

　　我外交部要求欧洲议会停止干涉中国内政行动
    新华社北京３月２５日电  本社记者今天获悉，中国外交部最近通过外交途径，要求欧洲议会立即停止一切干涉中国内政的行动。
    近日，外交部西欧司负责人约见欧洲共同体理事会主席国西班牙驻华大使和共同体委员会驻华代表团团长，对欧洲议会通过干涉中国内政的所谓《关于西藏人权》决议表示强烈愤慨和极大的遗憾，并强烈要求欧洲议会立即停止一切干涉中国内政的行动，以使双方关系能沿着健康的轨道发展。
    之后，西欧司负责人应约会见共同体理事会现任主席国西班牙驻华大使、上任和下任主席国驻华大使和共同体委员会驻华代表团团长，听取了他们转达的欧洲共同体十二国政府的立场。西欧司负责人再次阐明，西藏事务纯属中国内政，不容任何外国政府或组织以任何借口加以干涉。
