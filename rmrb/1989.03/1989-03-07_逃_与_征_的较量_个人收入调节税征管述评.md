The Struggle Between "Evasion" and "Collection"
— An Evaluation of the Management of Personal Income Adjustment Tax
By Pan Gang, Liu Xiao, and Wang Jinhu, reporters of this newspaper

In January 1987, China began collecting the personal income adjustment tax.

Over the past two years, the tax authorities have exerted tremendous efforts, but the results of the personal income adjustment tax collection have been far from satisfactory: only 31.33 million yuan was collected in 1987, and only 114.64 million yuan in 1988.

China's per capita income is relatively low, and it is not reasonable to expect personal income tax to account for 33% to 40% of the total tax revenue as it does in Western countries. However, it is also impossible to ignore the fact that in recent years, the personal income situation of the Chinese people has undergone significant changes. A considerable number of people have shifted from relying solely on wages and work points as their main source of income to obtaining income through various channels such as second jobs, contract operations, or investment in shares. Individuals with monthly incomes of over a thousand yuan, tens of thousands of yuan, or even more are no longer rare in various places. The amount of personal adjustment tax collected is only a few thousandths of industrial and commercial tax revenue, which is far from the actual tax base.

How Much Tax Revenue Is Lost?

A famous painter sold a painting for thousands of yuan; a famous actor earned tens of thousands of yuan from a single performance, but neither reported their income for tax purposes.

A private business owner in Northeast China, in just a few years, jumped from being a millionaire to a hundred-millionaire, and is now a "transport king" with over 40 cars and 500 million yuan in fixed assets. However, the tax records show that over the years, the tax he paid to the state is far from the amount he should have paid according to the tax law.

A staff member of the State Taxation Bureau, while on a business trip to Shanxi, accidentally discovered that the contractor of a factory earned 500,000 yuan in half a year, but after paying 100,000 yuan for the contract, he pocketed the remaining 400,000 yuan. The tax authorities in Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province, investigated 8 enterprises and found that 6 of them had similar situations.

There are also high-income individuals who rent out private homes and receive dividends, but very few of them pay taxes.

Nationwide, how many high-income individuals do not pay taxes? How much tax revenue is actually evaded? No one can answer, no one can explain clearly. However, the following two examples can give a glimpse:

In Xiamen, Fujian Province, a returned overseas Chinese opened a shop. According to his decades of business experience abroad, he kept his accounts and receipts in order and paid taxes of over a thousand yuan each month. In contrast, a neighboring shop of the same scale had the tax authorities visiting every few days, but could only barely pay a hundred yuan or so each month.

In 1988, Guangdong Province collected 135 million yuan in personal income adjustment tax, of which Shenzhen alone accounted for over 110 million yuan. It is easy to imagine how much tax revenue is evaded in other cities in this province, and in other provinces and cities.

Why Is the Tax Awareness So Low?

Clearly, there is a lot of tax revenue, but it is difficult to collect. Some people conclude: Chinese people have poor tax awareness.

Indeed, almost everywhere in the country, one can find examples of people who go to great lengths to evade taxes: some enterprise contractors or individual business owners either create fake accounts, or keep "off-the-books" accounts, or simply do not keep accounts at all; some famous painters invite clients into their homes to make transactions, receiving large sums of cash, but claim "gifts" to the outside world; some famous actors use fake names and fake units when receiving income from performances in other places. Some paying units, which should fulfill the obligation of withholding personal adjustment tax, do not withhold it seriously...

A Japanese professor, while lecturing in China, sighed: In China, people queue up to buy high-end consumer goods, while in Japan, people queue up to pay taxes on time.

In Western developed countries, personal income tax has been collected for nearly a hundred years, and paying taxes has become a habit. In China, for decades, there has been no personal taxation, coupled with people's hatred of various oppressive taxes in the old society, there is prejudice against taxation. This is understandable. However, if we analyze further, we will find that the tax awareness of Westerners is not innate. The tax collection and management methods established by Western countries, especially the severe penalties for tax violations, have complemented the strong tax awareness of today's citizens.

In the United States, for the handling of personal tax evasion, the penalty for serious cases can reach $100,000, and imprisonment for up to 5 years. The Dutch tax management law stipulates that if a taxpayer refuses to pay taxes and warnings are ineffective, the tax collector can directly exercise the power of compulsory collection. The power of compulsory collection includes sealing, auctioning, confiscating the taxpayer's property, and administratively detaining the taxpayer.

In stark contrast, although China also has penalties for tax violations, such as if a taxpayer does not declare taxes as required and the withholding obligation is not fulfilled, the tax authorities, in addition to ordering correction within a time limit, can impose a fine of up to 5,000 yuan; for individuals who evade taxes of more than 20,000 yuan and for those who refuse to pay taxes with serious circumstances, they are transferred to the procuratorate for investigation, but in the more than two years since the personal income adjustment tax was levied, there has not been a single case of personal income adjustment tax evasion being brought to court. In 1988, Beijing Municipality collected personal income adjustment tax, of which 15% was voluntarily declared, which is relatively high in the country. The former is severely punished, while the latter is lenient. Such a strong contrast, how can it not leave an impression on the taxpayers' minds?

There Should Be More Methods

The collection of personal income adjustment tax is difficult. The reporter asked many tax collection and management personnel, including some leading cadres, and they almost all said so.

What is the difficulty? The difficulty lies in the fact that this tax is directly levied on individuals, and the contradiction between national interests and personal interests is more prominent; the difficulty lies in the fact that many taxpayers do not want to keep accounts and do not voluntarily declare. However, the more "difficult" the task, the more "easy" aspects stand out.

For example, precisely because this tax is directly levied on individuals, if we truly act according to the law and implement severe penalties, the tax collection object will also feel more "painful." After a few heavy penalties, it is not afraid that he will not voluntarily pay taxes next time.

Again, for example, many business operators do not keep accounts and want to deceive tax officials, then we might as well learn from the practices of Western countries—at the end of the month or the end of the year, have experienced people go to "evaluate" him, and pay as much as is estimated. If you think the estimate is too high, then please present the "lower" account books and receipts.

Some countries and regions implement the invoice lottery system—periodically draw lots based on the invoice numbers, using the opportunity to win prizes to encourage customers to ask for invoices when purchasing goods, thereby blocking the loopholes for business owners to evade taxes. We might as well "borrow" this and try it.

Of course, the fact that there are many tax evaders also reflects, to some extent, that the current personal income adjustment tax regulations in China are not entirely reasonable. How to make the personal income adjustment tax not only play a role in adjusting the income gap among social members and strive to achieve fair social distribution, but also play a role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of all parties, it is necessary to continuously summarize and improve in practice.

　　“逃”与“征”的较量
    ——个人收入调节税征管述评
    本报记者  潘岗  刘霄  王锦鹄
    １９８７年１月，我国开征了个人收入调节税。
    两年来，税务部门费了九牛二虎之力，可个人收入调节税征管效果很不理想：１９８７年仅入库３１３３万元，１９８８年也只征收１１４６４万元。
    我国个人收入水平较低，不能要求个人所得税像西方国家那样占到整个税收总额的３３％—４０％。但也不能不看到，近年来我国人民群众的个人收入情况已发生很大变化，有相当一部分人已由过去单纯以工资、工分为主要收入来源，转向由从事第二职业、经营承包或投资入股等多种渠道取得收入，个人月收入上千元、上万元甚至更多的，在各地已不罕见。个人调节税征收额仅占工商税收千分之零点几，与实际税源相差太大。
    税源流失知多少
    有位名画家，一幅画市场卖数千元；有位名演员，一次“走穴”演出收入上万元，可都没有主动申报纳税。
    东北某私营业主，短短几年由万元、十万元到百万元户连跳“三级”，目前已成为有４０多部汽车，５００多万元固定资产的“运输大王”。可税务机关的帐目表明，几年来，他交给国家的税款与税法规定应交数，相去甚远。
    国家税务局一干部出差山西，无意间发现一家工厂承包人，半年收入５万元，可他交完１万元承包款，其余４万全部装进自己腰包。辽宁省凤城县税务部门调查了８户企业，就发现有６户承包者有上述类似情况。
    还有私房出租、股息分红的高收入者，纳税的屈指可数。
    在全国，究竟有多少高收入者没有纳税？实际偷漏了多少税款？谁也回答不出，谁也说不清楚。不过，从下列二例可窥见一斑：
    福建省厦门市一归国华侨开了一间商店，他按照几十年在国外经商的习惯，帐目票据齐全，每月主动交税上千元；而与他相邻的一家同等规模商店，税务部门三天两头登门，每月才勉强交出百十元；
    １９８８年，广东全省征收个人收入调节税１３５０万元，其中仅深圳一市即达１１００多万元。可想而知，在这个省的其他城市，在别的省、市，漏交的税源多么可观。
    纳税意识为何差
    明明知道税源不少，可就是收不上来。有人下结论：中国人纳税意识太差。
    的确，几乎在全国每一个地方，都可发现一些为了逃税，费尽心机的事例：有的企业承包人、个体户，或建假帐，或建“帐外帐”，或干脆不建帐；有的名画家将客商请进家里交易，接过大把钞票，对外却声称“赠送”；有的名演员在外地演出领取收入时，故意写假名字、假单位。而一些支付款单位，本应履行代扣个人调节税义务，却不认真代扣……
    日本一教授来华讲学时感叹：在中国，人们排长队是为了能买到高档消费品，而在日本，人们排长队是为了如期完税。
    西方发达国家，课收个人所得税差不多都有上百年历史，纳税成为习惯。我国几十年来一直没有向个人征税，再加上人们对旧社会各种苛捐杂税的憎恶，对税收存有偏见。这是不难理解的。然而，如果再进一步分析就会发现，西方人的纳税意识也非从娘胎里带来。西方国家建立的一整套税收征管办法，特别是对税收违章的严厉制裁措施，与今天国民的强烈纳税意识相辅相成。
    在美国，对于个人逃税的处理，严重的罚款达１０万美元，并处或单处入狱５年。荷兰征管法规定，纳税人如拒不纳税并警告无效者，税收征管员就可以直接行使强制征收权利。强制征收权利包括查封、变卖、没收纳税人的财产和对纳税人实行行政拘留。
    与此形成鲜明对照的是，我国虽然也对税收违章规定了制裁措施，如纳税人不按规定申报纳税和扣缴义务人不履行代扣代缴义务，税务机关除责令其限期纠正外，可处以５０００元以下罚款；对偷漏税２０００元以上的个人以及抗税不交情节严重的，移交检察机关立案侦查等，但是，自开征个人调节税以来的两年多时间里，还没有听说有几个因偷漏个人收入调节税进法院。北京市１９８８年征收的个人收入调节税中，主动申报纳税的占１５％，这在全国是较高的。前者严加惩处，后者宽大为怀。这样强烈的反差，怎能不在纳税人的观念上留下烙印？
    办法不妨多一些
    个人收入调节税征管难。记者问过许多税收征管员，包括一些领导干部，他们差不多都这样说。
    难在何处？难在是对个人直接课征的，国家利益和个人利益的矛盾显得更加突出；难在不少纳税人不愿建帐、不主动申报。然而，越“难”办的事，往往“易”的一面也突出。
    譬如，正因这种税是直接对个人征的，如果真心依法办事，实行严厉制裁措施，征税对象也比非个人“疼”得厉害。重罚几次，不怕他下次还不主动纳税。
    再如，不少经营者不建帐，想蒙蔽税务人员，那么，我们不妨学学西方国家的做法——月终岁末，请有经验的人去给他“评估”，估多少，交多少。如嫌估的高，那就请拿出“低”的帐册、票据来。
    一些国家和地区实行的发货票抽奖制度——定期按发货票号码公开摇奖，用得奖机遇促使顾客买商品时要发票，从而堵塞业主逃税漏洞，我们也不妨“拿来”试试。
    当然，个人逃税者众，也从一个方面反映出我国现行的个人收入调节税条例还有不尽合理之处。如何使个人收入调节税既起到调节社会成员收入悬殊的矛盾，力求实现社会分配公平，又能起到调动各方面的积极性，还需在实践中不断总结、完善。
