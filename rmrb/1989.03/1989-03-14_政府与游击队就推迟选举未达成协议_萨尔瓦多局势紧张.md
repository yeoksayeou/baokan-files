Government and Guerrillas Fail to Agree on Postponing Elections, Tensions Rise in El Salvador

New China News Agency, Beijing, March 13 — (Reporter Liu Ruichang) El Salvador is set to hold its presidential election on March 19. As the election approaches, the government and the guerrillas have failed to reach an agreement on postponing the election, leading to frequent armed conflicts and heightened tensions.

The preparations for El Salvador's election are already in place. The two major parties, the ruling Christian Democratic Party and the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance, which has a hardline stance against the guerrillas, will compete in the election. It is speculated that the Nationalist Republican Alliance has a higher chance of winning the election. This is also the main reason why the guerrillas are demanding to postpone and obstruct this election.

Since early March, the guerrillas have launched fierce attacks on government forces in five out of the 14 provinces across the country. The government forces have also mobilized troops and intensified their crackdown on the guerrillas. Reports indicate that both sides have suffered hundreds of casualties.

In late January of this year, the guerrillas proposed a peace initiative, calling for the government to postpone the election by half a year to September 15, allowing the guerrillas to participate in the election. The government rejected this proposal on constitutional grounds and suggested postponing the election to April 30. As no agreement was reached, the election will proceed as scheduled. Recently, the guerrillas called on the people not to vote and announced that all public transportation services must go on strike before the election, otherwise, the guerrillas will attack all operating vehicles. On March 12, El Salvador's President Duarte sent a telegram to the United Nations and other international organizations and relevant governments, requesting assistance in stopping the guerrillas' obstruction of the election.

### 政府与游击队就推迟选举未达成协议  萨尔瓦多局势紧张

　　政府与游击队就推迟选举未达成协议
    萨尔瓦多局势紧张
    新华社北京３月１３日电  （记者刘瑞常）萨尔瓦多３月１９日将举行大选，选举共和国总统。大选前夕，由于政府与游击队未就推迟选举等问题达成协议，双方武装冲突频繁，局势紧张。
    萨尔瓦多大选现已准备就绪。执政的基督教民主党和对游击队态度极为强硬的右翼党民族主义共和联盟两大主要政党的总统候选人将在大选中决一雌雄。据推测，民族主义共和联盟赢得大选的可能性较大。这也正是游击队要求推迟和阻挠这次大选的主要原因。
    ３月初以来，游击队在全国１４个省中的５个省向政府军发动猛烈进攻。政府军也调兵遣将，加紧围剿游击队。据报道，双方伤亡数百人。
    今年１月下旬，游击队提出和平建议，要求政府把大选推迟半年于９月１５日举行，以便使游击队也能参加竞选。政府以违宪为理由拒绝了这一建议，并提出可以把大选推迟到４月３０日举行。由于各方未能就此达成协议，大选仍按期举行。最近，游击队号召人民不参加投票，并宣布大选前夕全国公共交通部门必须举行大罢工，否则，游击队将对届时运营的一切交通工具进行袭击。萨尔瓦多总统杜阿尔特３月１２日致电联合国等国际组织和有关政府，要求帮助制止游击队阻挠大选的活动。
