On the morning of the 20th, an elderly man wearing a badge indicating his attendance at the CPPCC session visited the residence of the Qinghai delegation. He was the father of the Panchen Lama and vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region CPPCC, Yao Xi Gu Gongcai Dan. He had come specifically to pay a return visit.

It turned out that on the evening of the 19th, the Qinghai National People's Congress delegates visited the residence in Beijing where the Panchen Lama had lived. Unfortunately, Yao Xi Gu Gongcai Dan was attending the CPPCC session. The delegates presented hadas to the Panchen Lama's memorial hall. Song Ruixiang, while presenting a hada to the Panchen Lama's mother, Yao Xi Suolang Zhuoma, said, "We hope you, Mother, will take care of yourself and stay strong." The elderly woman repeatedly expressed her thanks. Song Ruijue Lang said, "Qinghai is the Panchen Lama's hometown. Now that the Lama is no longer with us, it is our duty to visit his parents."

　　班禅之父回访青海代表
    ２０日上午，青海代表团驻地来了一位胸佩政协会议出席证的老人，他是班禅的父亲、西藏政协副主席尧西·古公才旦。他是特地来回访的。
    原来，１９日晚上，青海人大代表来到班禅生前在京的住地看望班禅的父母。不巧，尧西·古公才旦出席政协会议去了。代表们向班禅的灵堂献了哈达。宋瑞祥在向班禅母亲尧西·索朗卓玛献哈达时说：“希望阿妈节哀，保重身体。”老人连声道谢。宦爵才郎说：“青海是班禅大师的故乡，现在大师不在了，我们理应看望他的双亲。”
