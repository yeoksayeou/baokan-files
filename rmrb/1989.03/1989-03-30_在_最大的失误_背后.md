Behind the "Greatest Mistake"

By Lü Fang, Reporter for This Newspaper

Seeing Premier Li Peng mention in the "Government Work Report" that the state will increase educational funding by 500 million yuan this year, and hearing Chairman Deng Xiaoping say in a meeting with foreign guests that "the greatest mistake in the past 10 years is that education has not developed enough," the intellectual representatives attending the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress generally feel optimistic. In recent days, they have discussed several issues behind the "greatest mistake," such as the functions and purposes of education, the benefits of educational investment, and the treatment of intellectuals.

People's Congress representative and Vice President of Guangxi Minzu University Zhou Feixiong believes that the proposition "education serves economic construction" is worth reconsidering, as it can easily lead to short-term behavior. He advocates for raising the functions and purposes of education to improving people's quality. The quality of an individual, he argues, mainly refers to having basic ethical morals, possessing a certain level of scientific and cultural knowledge, and knowing how to think.

The widely held view that "economic development will lead to more money for education" has recently been doubted by many. They believe that it should be the other way around—only with the development of education can the economy develop.

Representatives from Anhui provided some data: for less than 10% of middle school students who can advance to higher education, a significant portion of human, material, and financial resources are spent. However, for the over 90% who cannot advance, especially the various talents needed in rural areas, very little investment and effort are made. Representatives call for reforming the structure of secondary education to improve the benefits of educational investment.

Some majors in higher education institutions are oversupplied, and graduates often end up using skills unrelated to their training, which is another reason for the low returns on educational investment. People's Congress representative and President of Tianjin University Wu Yongshi proposed: universities should proactively share the nation's concerns and, based on scientific predictions of talent needs, consciously adjust the structure of disciplines, levels, and distribution. Their efforts have already shown some results. This year, the ratio of the number of graduates from Tianjin University to the social demand for its graduates is 1:2.4.

During the interviews, many representatives linked the treatment of intellectuals to the development of productive forces. They believe that intellectuals represent the most advanced and active part of productive forces and should, therefore, benefit from distribution. Unfortunately, the phrase "poor as a professor" has become a common joke in real life.

People's Congress representative and Professor of Changchun Geological College Zeng Xiaozhen told the reporter that in the past decade, he has supervised nearly 20 graduate students. Currently, less than 1/5 of them are engaged in geological research and teaching. Professor Zeng's regret and anxiety were evident. However, he also found some comfort in a news item broadcast by Xinhua News Agency on March 26, which stated: "The number of students enrolled in normal universities in China has increased significantly, currently accounting for about 35% of the total enrollment in universities nationwide." Those who understand the situation know that this is the result of the state's recent efforts to improve the treatment of students in normal universities.

### 在“最大的失误”背后

　　在“最大的失误”背后
    本报记者  鹿舫
    眼看着国务院总理李鹏在《政府工作报告》中提到国家今年增加教育经费５０亿元，耳听着中央军委主席邓小平在会见外宾时说“１０年中最大的失误是在教育方面发展不够”，出席七届人大二次会议的知识分子代表心绪普遍看好。近日里他们又围绕教育的功能和目的，教育投资效益、知识分子待遇等“最大失误”背后的几个问题，议论开了。
    人大代表、广西民族学院副院长周飞雄认为，“教育为经济建设服务”的提法值得推敲，因为它容易造成短期行为。他主张提教育的功能和目的是提高人的素质。而某个人的素质，又主要是指他有基本的伦理道德，具备一定的科学文化知识，懂得如何思考问题。
    “经济发展了，才有钱办教育”这个甚为普遍的观点，眼下引起了不少人士的怀疑。他们觉得应该倒过来——只有教育发展了，经济才能发展。
    来自安徽的人大代表提供了这样几个数据：对全省中学生中不到１０％的能升学者，花去了中等教育的绝大部分人力、物力、财力，而对９０％以上不能升学者，尤其是农村急需的各类人才，却很少花本钱、下功夫培养。代表们呼吁：改革中等教育结构，提高教育投资效益。
    高等院校某些专业过剩，毕业生用非所学，这也是造成教育投资效益低下的一个原因。人大代表、天津大学校长吴咏诗提出：高校要主动为国分忧，依据对人才需求的科学预测，自觉调整学科结构、层次结构、布点结构。他们的努力现已初见成效。今年天津大学毕业生的数目与社会对该校毕业生的需求数目二者之间的比例为１∶２．４。
    记者在采访中发现，许多人大代表联系社会生产力的发展来谈知识分子的待遇。大家认为知识分子代表了生产力中最先进最活跃的部分，因而要理所当然地让他们从分配中获益。可叹的是，“穷得像个教授”却成了现实生活中的调侃语。
    人大代表、长春地质学院教授曾孝箴告诉记者，他近十年来带了近２０名研究生。他们中目前在做地质科研教学工作的不足１／５。曾教授痛惜、焦虑之情溢于言表。不过他也从新华社３月２６日播出的一则电讯中得到了某种宽慰。那电讯说：“我国师范院校招生数量大幅度上升，目前已占全国高校招生总数的３５％左右。”了解内情的人都知道，这是近几年国家提高师范院校学生待遇的结果。
