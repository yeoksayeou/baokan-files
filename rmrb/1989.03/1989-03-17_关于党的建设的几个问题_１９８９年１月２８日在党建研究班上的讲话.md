The Party Building Research Class has been running for 24 days, and the discussions have been very good. The Central Discipline Inspection Commission is currently holding a national disciplinary inspection work conference, which is also going very well. The specialized discussions of the Party Building Research Class have not yet concluded, so I will take this opportunity to discuss several issues regarding the current state of Party building as my contribution to the discussion.

First, we must prioritize Party building in the agenda of Party committees at all levels. The work of Party committees involves countless tasks, but ultimately, it boils down to two main areas: one is to promote the development of a socialist commodity economy, and the other is to focus on the ideological and political realm. To effectively handle the ideological and political realm, the key is to strengthen Party building. Our Party is the core leading force for the Chinese people to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. If the Party can grasp and do well in these two areas, it can lead the overall situation.

Why is this the case? Because our society cannot afford to stagnate or be chaotic. Both stagnation and chaos do not serve the interests of the 1 billion Chinese people. If we do not reform and open up, and do not develop a planned commodity economy, the development of productive forces will be slow, and we will not be able to shake off poverty. The entire society's development will stagnate, and the gap with developed countries will widen. However, while developing a socialist commodity economy, if we neglect the ideological and political realm, various forms of corruption will emerge and spread, making our society chaotic. The ideological and political realm includes many aspects such as ideology, news and public opinion, legal work, clean governance, mass work, and social customs, all of which are very important. However, we must focus on Party building as the key and crucial point. If the Party has combat effectiveness, all aspects of ideological and political work will have a backbone. Therefore, in summary, it comes down to three points: building socialism with Chinese characteristics requires promoting the development of a socialist commodity economy; promoting the development of a socialist commodity economy while neglecting the ideological and political realm is not acceptable; focusing on the ideological and political realm while not prioritizing Party building is also not acceptable.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly emphasized the need to focus on both areas. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "One hand is to adhere to the policy of opening up to the outside world and activating the economy internally, and the other hand is to resolutely crack down on economic crimes." Comrade Deng Xiaoping also said, "One hand to promote reform and opening up, and the other hand to rectify the Party," "One hand to promote construction, and the other hand to promote the rule of law." These are different perspectives but consistent in meaning. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has also repeatedly emphasized that whether it is cracking down on economic crimes, rectifying the Party, or promoting the rule of law, it is all to ensure that reform and opening up can proceed smoothly. Without this hand, our reform and opening up will be difficult to carry out smoothly. I understand that the two-pronged approach is a very important theoretical issue and a very important policy that must be firmly grasped in practical work. The basic line for the primary stage of socialism is one center and two basic points. The work of Party committees should revolve around one center and grasp both hands to promote the development of material and spiritual civilization. In the two-pronged approach, the ideological and political realm is very important in preventing corruption. Because reform and opening up indeed bring a danger of corruption, we must see this point. We say that some of the current problems are not directly caused by reform and opening up, but the environment of reform, opening up, and activation indeed provides soil, a breeding ground, and gaps for corruption. To stop eating because of choking, to fear flies coming in and not open the window, or to open it and then close it, is wrong. However, if the window is opened and flies come in but are not exterminated, that is also not acceptable. Ten years of practice have proven that the overall policy of reform, opening up, and activation that our Party has implemented can promote the development of productive forces. Although there are various opinions from the people in economic work, I believe that the fact that reform, opening up, and activation promote the development of social productive forces is recognized by the majority and is evident to all. If we can reduce corruption to the lowest level while developing a socialist commodity economy, socialism with Chinese characteristics will be able to fully demonstrate its superiority. I think we should look at it this way: we can only fully demonstrate the correctness of our line and the superiority of our system by promoting the relatively rapid development of productive forces while preventing the spread of corruption. Our economy should be a vibrant economy, and our politics should be good and stable. The two should be closely combined, and it is possible to achieve the revitalization of the Chinese nation with relatively little cost and relatively fast steps.

Second, on the current state of the Party. Comrades have discussed this issue vigorously, citing a large number of facts and analyzing from various angles. I think the basic assessment is consistent, that is, we must look at the issue from two aspects and not just one. This is a method that Comrade Mao Zedong has always advocated. The great development of the past ten years was carried out under the leadership of the Party. The Party's line is correct. There have been many new creations in various aspects of work. The Party organizations at all levels are generally combat-effective. The vast majority of Party members are working hard for the people. These are basic facts that cannot be erased. If our Party were completely dark, how could we have achieved the past achievements? Where would our future hopes lie? This is one aspect. On the other hand, we must see that there are indeed phenomena of corruption and laxity within the Party. These negative factors are corroding the Party's body, damaging the relationship between the Party and the masses, and harming the Party's cause. I agree with the comrades' view that we should look at the issue dynamically. That is, after assessing the current state of the Party, we should also look at how the Party will develop in the future. At present, the main trend of our Party is good, but there are many negative phenomena developing and growing. If we adopt the correct policy, our Party will continue to develop in the correct and healthy direction in the future; if we adopt another policy, the result will be different. Therefore, we must look at the issue dynamically. If we let things go and do nothing, they will become rampant. This is a possibility that we must avoid, a bad possibility. What we must do is to realize the good possibility, that is, to face the problem squarely, to govern the Party strictly, and to persistently and unremittingly fight against these corrupt and lax factors. In this way, the Party can be further consolidated, the relationship between the Party and the masses can be further strengthened, and the development of the Party's cause can be guaranteed.

Why is it that on one hand there is a great development of the Party's cause, and on the other hand there are quite serious and unignorable problems? Comrade Qiao Shi said at the opening of the research class that our Party is in a historical period of great transformation. This statement is very good and points out the background for observing the Party's situation and studying Party building. When we study the Party's situation, we must not forget the objective fact that the Party is in a historical period of great transformation. Looking back at the history of our Party, whenever there is a historical period of great transformation, similar phenomena have appeared: some are confused about the Party's line; some cannot withstand new tests. The invasion of Japan, the decline of class contradictions, the rise of national contradictions, the transition from a decade of civil war to the united front, some people did not understand the policy of the united front, and some people could not withstand the test of the united front environment. The same is true when entering the city, transitioning from revolutionary war to peaceful construction, some people could not withstand the invasion of sugar-coated bullets, and some people were satisfied with "thirty mu of land and one cow, wife, children, and a warm bed," and retreated. The current transformation, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, can be called another revolution. The transition from product economy to planned commodity economy, from closure to openness, involves various aspects of social life. Some people do not understand, and some people cannot withstand the test, which is also understandable. Precisely because of this, we should pay more attention to Party building. Great transformation is a test for every Party member and a test for the entire Party. The objective test is severe, so subjectively, we must adhere to the policy of governing the Party strictly and put forward higher and stricter requirements for Party members. In the face of severe tests, some Party members will inevitably be eliminated, but our Party and the Party's cause will continue to move forward. In the past 68 years of struggle, our Party has successfully gone through many severe tests and promoted the development of Chinese history; now and in the future, we will definitely be able to successfully withstand the tests of reform and opening up and the development of commodity economy, and promote the historical process of China's socialist modernization. The whole Party should be fully prepared in spirit and have sufficient confidence.

Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly argued in "The Launch of the Communist" that the process of Party building, the failure and success of the Party, the retreat and advance of the Party, the shrinkage and expansion of the Party, the development and consolidation of the Party, are all closely linked to the Party's political line.

In a word, Party building must be linked to the Party's political line and cannot be separated from the Party's political line. This is our most precious experience in Party building. The 13th Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee emphasized this guiding ideology when discussing Party building issues. The various problems that currently exist within our Party, ultimately, are that certain aspects of the Party's situation are not in line with the Party's line or are very inconsistent. From the current actual situation, we need to focus on three issues in Party building: the issue of clean governance, the issue of cohesion within the Party, and the issue of the Party's attraction to the masses. These three are all major political issues. As long as our team is pure, our steps are consistent, and we can unite the broad masses around us, our Party will be invincible.

Third, maintaining the clean governance of Party and government organs is a very important task in current Party building. The more prosperous the economy is, the more active the commodity economy is, the higher the awareness of Party members in maintaining clean governance should be, and the stricter the Party's discipline in this regard should be. We are developing a commodity economy under open conditions, and to develop a commodity economy, we also need to study many successful experiences of capitalist countries in this regard. However, we are not learning capitalist private ownership, and we should not envy and imitate the harm-to-others-for-profit, greed, deception, and all other bad things that arise from the development of capitalist private ownership. At a certain stage of commodity economy development, some social phenomena are difficult to completely avoid. The economy has been activated, internal and external exchanges have expanded, and people, money, and materials have all become widely mobile. In this situation, it is indeed difficult to manage social order, social order, and social customs as "purified" as in the past. It requires a process of legal system construction, a process of human quality improvement, and continuous summarization and accumulation of experience. However, Party and government organs should be strictly managed. Currently, 69% of government officials are Communist Party members; the proportion of Communist Party members among those in leadership positions is even higher. Communist Party members should not only maintain self-discipline but also be the most courageous and resolute force in maintaining clean governance and fighting corruption. Those who are enthusiastic about developing a socialist commodity economy should also be enthusiastic about establishing a new order for socialist commodity economy. Those who use the development of commodity economy to fish in troubled waters and use the opportunity to exercise public power to seek bribes, embezzle, and seek personal gain are harmful elements that disrupt reform and opening up, and are worms that violate laws and Party discipline. Communist Party members, regardless of their work ability or level of understanding, must take serving the people as their purpose and must not commit errors of the nature of trading power for money. If they do, they will tarnish the name of a Communist Party member. We insist on managing Party and government organs strictly, not only because the nature of the Party and the government requires it, but also because this is the most effective way to stop the spread of corruption in society. The so-called corruption issue is currently mainly manifested as trading power for money. Some people in society need to use those in power to gain convenience, while those in power are mainly in Party and government organs, and some of them want to use their power to seek personal gain. This phenomenon, generally speaking, is prominent in many countries at a certain stage of commodity economy development, especially when the legal system is not sound. However, we are a socialist country, and the Party and government should be able and have the ability to reduce corruption to the lowest level and absolutely cannot allow it to spread. We strictly manage Party and government organs, including law enforcement agencies and public service units, and truly solve the problems existing in these departments, curb the phenomenon of trading power for money, and can stop the spread of corruption in society.

The Central Secretariat recently discussed the issue of clean governance and believes that this is a major issue in governing the Party strictly and a serious political issue. This issue requires comprehensive governance. Currently, we should focus on two things. One is to seriously investigate and deal with cases. All cases with leads must be investigated to the bottom, and all those who violate laws and Party discipline must be severely punished. Cases involving laws and regulations, of course, should be handled by state judicial organs and government supervisory organs. However, for relevant Communist Party members, Party discipline must also be applied, and the requirements of Party discipline should be stricter than administrative and legal discipline. This is the current central task of the Party's disciplinary inspection organs at all levels. Comrades engaged in Party disciplinary inspection work have a heavy responsibility and must be impartial and uphold principles. The other is to strengthen institutional construction, especially for administrative departments and public service units that directly serve residents and enterprises, institutional construction must be strengthened. The rules for handling matters should be made public, and the results of handling matters should also be made public, accepting supervision from the masses. Handling matters according to regulations and handling matters publicly is a major construction of a new order for socialist commodity economy and a major construction of socialist democratic politics. The Party organizations in administrative departments and public service units should fully play a role in the institutional construction of their units. This work is difficult. However, the experience of pilot units such as Dongcheng District in Beijing, Huangpu District in Shanghai, Yanzhou in Shandong, and Xiaocheng in Hebei has already proven that as long as it is done seriously and persistently, it will gradually improve. Comrade Jiang Chunyun from Shandong told Comrades Qiao Shi and Song Pian and me that their Yanzhou and Changle are very effective, with strong feedback from the masses, and the time taken is not long. It can be seen that the work of clean governance is difficult, but whether it is done or not makes a big difference. Xiaoxian in Hebei has made changes in clean governance in a few months. Therefore, the key is to grasp it firmly. With a firm attitude from the leadership, personally grasping it and taking the lead, methods will also come out. What to grasp? Start from the hot issues that people care about, have the most opinions, and are discussed the most, and gradually expand. There are still fresh experiences at the grassroots level now. In short, if we do a good job in investigating and dealing with cases and institutional construction, we can both prevent problems in advance and punish them afterwards, and our Party will have the mechanism and ability to fight corruption.

Fourth, we must strengthen the Party's internal cohesion in terms of ideology and organization. As long as there are no major problems within the Party on the land of China, the country will not have major problems, and even if there are problems, there will be the strength to solve them. This is the sentence I said at the previous Party School symposium: the key to China's problems still lies within the Communist Party. Our Party is the leading force for China's reform and modernization construction and the dominant factor in the stability of the domestic political situation. The 47 million Party members are mostly outstanding individuals in society. The whole Party is united, and there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. Those who do not like our Party, and those who are more realistic, also know that they cannot replace us or destroy us from the outside. They hope for disintegration within us. The Chinese people have long been ridiculed as "a heap of loose sand." Sun Yat-sen tried to change this situation, but he did not succeed. Our Party, due to its correct ideals, theories, policies, and work, and its strong spirit of dedication and strict discipline, has united the people of the whole country, making the Chinese revolution successful.

Comrade Chen Yun once said a very concise and profound sentence about Party building: "Every Communist Party member should always remember that he is a Communist Party member." I understand that remembering that one is a Communist Party member is to strengthen the Party's consciousness, execute the Party's line, observe the Party's discipline, and maintain the Party's principles. If everyone does this, the Party will be consolidated; otherwise, it will inevitably become lax. Our Party is very large, with so many Party members distributed in various fields, with different positions, some in the central government, some in local governments, some in Party committees, some in governments, people's congresses, political consultative conferences, mass organizations, some in enterprises, schools, and rural areas. However, everyone should always remember that they are Communist Party members and have the obligation to execute the Party's line, observe the Party's discipline, maintain the Party's principles, and strengthen the Party's consciousness. In this way, our direction, goals, and steps can be consistent, and the Party will have combat effectiveness. To do this, we must rely on the Party's ideological and organizational construction. Among them, the first is ideological construction, that is, to arm the whole Party with the theory and line of the 13th Party Congress. In the discussion of this Party Building Research Class, this issue has also been prominently raised, indicating that everyone's understanding is consistent and that everyone sees the importance of this issue.

The line of the 13th Party Congress has two basic points. Opposing the four basic principles or opposing reform and opening up is not allowed by the Party's political discipline. The vast majority of Party members understand this reason and support the Party's line. However, there are indeed some vague ideas within the Party and a lack of sufficient ideological preparation for reform and opening up. Some people lack ideological preparation for the necessity of reform and opening up and do not fully understand that this is the inevitable path to give full play to the superiority of the socialist system. Some people lack ideological preparation for the arduousness and long-term nature of reform and hope that the path of reform will be straight and the pace will be fast. Some people lack ideological preparation for the fact that reform will inevitably pay a price and encounter difficulties and fantasize that every reform measure will immediately bring huge, linear benefits to everyone, and become discouraged when encountering difficulties. These are all factors leading to ideological laxity. There are also some people whose way of looking at problems is wrong. In the past, under the closed state, they did not understand the situation abroad. Now that it is open, they compare China with developed countries and think that socialism is no longer viable. In fact, we should compare two things: one is the social system, and the other is the stage of development. Without the stage of development, we will draw wrong conclusions, as if all problems are brought about by the social system, as if socialism is not as good as capitalism. We should realistically see that at the level of per capita national income of a few hundred dollars, in terms of social stability, fair distribution, quality of life, education level, health conditions, social welfare, democracy, and legal system construction, and other aspects, from an overall perspective, our situation is better than that of capitalist countries at the same economic development level. Not to mention that we have a population of 1 billion and more difficulties. And our situation is the same as that of capitalist countries at the same development level, with a per capita national income of a few hundred dollars, none of which are not characterized by a wide gap between the rich and the poor, social injustice, and political turmoil. We can observe with an open mind and compare. There is another way of comparison, comparing us with Europe, America, and Japan. This way of comparison is not scientific and objective because we were originally backward, not just now. They have undergone more than a hundred years, more than two hundred years of development, including the stage of colonial plunder. How can we compare two different stages of development? Since reform and opening up, we have been leading in the speed of economic development and the improvement of comprehensive national strength, which is a recognized fact. In the future, when our per capita national income reaches the level of moderately developed countries, our social situation will be better in many aspects than moderately developed capitalist countries, and in some aspects, it may even be better than the most developed capitalist countries. The comparison of different social system countries can only be made with the actual level of the same economic development stage, and different stages of development and different social systems should not be confused. We are in a relatively backward stage of development, which cannot be blamed on heaven or people, nor should it be attributed to the social system, but should be used to strengthen our resolve and unite as one to implement the line of the 13th Party Congress. The line of the 13th Party Congress is concentrated on one point, which is to solve the problem of how to develop productive forces more quickly under the socialist system. Now, everyone is dissatisfied with our backward situation, and I think there is no need to find a new prescription. It is to sincerely and honestly implement the line of the 13th Party Congress and strive for self-improvement. Although the theory and line of the 13th Party Congress still need to be enriched, improved, and developed, only by resolutely implementing the theory and line of the 13th Party Congress can we promote the development of productive forces under the socialist system. Other prescriptions do not conform to China's reality. This point, the whole Party must be unwavering, especially the leaders at all levels must be unwavering and not swayed by various erroneous trends of thought. The education of the theory and line of the 13th Party Congress should be combined with the education of the situation and should be done very seriously, deeply, vividly, and with targeted and persuasive content. Old problems solved, new problems will arise, this hot issue solved, other hot issues will arise. There will always be vague understandings within the Party, which need to be clarified and clarified in a timely manner, so that the Party can always maintain a strong cohesion.

Emphasizing the Party's cohesion is consistent with promoting democracy. The promotion of democracy within the Party is a powerful factor in enhancing the Party's cohesion; while the enhancement of the Party's cohesion can improve our capacity to bear, becoming a necessary condition for further promoting social democracy. In the new situation, we must better implement the Party's democratic centralism. Expanding Party democracy is to make the Party full of vitality in great struggles, to be happy and capable, to consolidate the Party's ranks and promote the Party's cause, and to effectively execute the resolutions of the Party's highest leading organ—the National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Central Committee it produces. For Communist Party members, if democracy is used as an excuse to smear the image of the Party and the line of the Party and harm the cause of the Party, this is not allowed by the democratic centralism and discipline of the Party.

Fifth, we must strengthen the leadership of the Party and at the same time strive to improve the leadership of the Party. Improving the leadership of the Party can enhance the Party's attraction to the masses. The greater the attraction, the better the Party can realize its leadership. Within the Party, we must talk about cohesion, and towards non-Party masses, we must talk about attraction and persuasion, so that the Party can have a strong combat effectiveness. In the conditions of reform and opening up, doing mass work requires adapting to the requirements of socialist democratic political construction and learning new skills. Comrade Mao Zedong once said, "The so-called leadership is not to shout it as a slogan every day, nor to dominate others and make them obey us, but to persuade and educate non-Party people with the correct policies of the Party and our model work, so that they are willing to accept our suggestions." Comrade Mao Zedong's remarks on how to realize the leadership of the Party are very good, and we should ponder them carefully. This is even more necessary in the peaceful construction period.

The leadership of the Communist Party is in the fundamental interests of the Chinese people. China cannot practice the multi-party system of the West. In our country, there is the Communist Party and there are eight democratic parties. The relationship between the Communist Party and the democratic parties is not the relationship between the ruling party and the opposition party. Our Party and the democratic parties both advocate the implementation of the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party. This system is historically formed, in line with our national conditions, has played a very good role, and will play a better role in the future, and is a basic content of the political pattern of our primary stage of socialism. In the new historical period, the content of multi-party cooperation and political consultation should be further enriched, and the form should be further improved. This should be done step by step according to actual conditions and requires the joint efforts of our Party and the democratic parties. Political system reform is not to change the overall situation of our Party's leadership, but to better give play to the advantages of this overall situation, so that our Party and the democratic parties can cooperate better, more closely, and more effectively.

Since the 13th Party Congress, there has been significant progress in the separation of Party and government. This is correct and beneficial to improving and strengthening the leadership of the Party. County-level and above Party committees have been freed from daily administrative and economic affairs, which allows them to better perform their political leadership functions and concentrate their efforts on reform and Party building. The political leadership of the Party is very important in the leadership of major policies and guidelines. Some comrades have asked what constitutes "major"? We say that the functions and powers of the central and local Party committees are different, but both are responsible for political leadership in major policies and guidelines. How local Party committees at all levels specifically do this can be explored and studied in practice. Reform is a matter that encompasses the entire situation, and Party committees at all levels should take it up and do it well. The Party should truly govern the Party. This problem has been talked about for many years but has not been well solved. In addition to the reasons of ideological understanding, it is also related to the past system of Party and government not being separated. After the separation of Party and government, Party members working in state organs and mass organizations should work together with comrades in Party committees to jointly execute the line, policies, and guidelines of the Party and reflect the leadership of the Party. Reform involves the adjustment of various relationships, and in this situation, we should emphasize mutual understanding, support, and friendship among each other. Since the promulgation of the "Enterprise Law," many enterprises have created good experiences in straightening out the relationship between Party and government. Party committees at all levels should pay attention to summarizing and promoting their experiences, so that more enterprise Party organizations can firmly and unshakably follow the provisions of the "Enterprise Law" and the "Notice" of the Central Committee to transform their functions. Enterprise Party organizations should truly manage the Party members in their enterprises, so that Party members (including those who work in administrative positions) can play a role, act according to the policies and principles of the Party, act according to the laws and plans of the state, and closely connect with the masses, taking on the tasks of guarantee and supervision.

An important issue in strengthening the leadership of the Party is to strengthen the construction of leading cadres at all levels of the Party. The situation of leading cadres at all levels is of great significance to the Party's cause. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, we have done a lot of work in the construction of leading cadres. The current leading cadres at all levels are basically good. Of course, due to lack of experience, there are also some problems. One is that some young cadres originally worked in technology and professional fields and are not familiar with Party work; one is that in terms of age structure, the levels are not spread out, and if not paid attention to, there will be a problem of retiring and replacing at the same time in the future. Now we cannot make major adjustments, but only gradually adjust and improve in daily work. Generally speaking, the current situation requires attention to stability and improvement. Considering the large increase in new elements, we should especially emphasize learning and unity in the construction of leading cadres. Learning is very important, including learning in practice. After entering the leading cadre team, one must seriously learn the things that a member of the leading cadre team must master. We do not want dogmatism, nor do we want empiricism, but we must learn Marxism-Leninism, the basic theory and line of the Party, the policies and guidelines of the Party, and the basic knowledge of the Party in a way that combines theory with practice. We must learn repeatedly and deeply in combination with actual work. Comrades in the leading cadre team should also strengthen their Party spirit training, strengthen the Party's consciousness, and solve the relationship between the individual and the Party. Some young cadres have pioneering spirit and are very capable, but due to lack of Party spirit training, they have incorrect attitudes towards fame, position, and power. Communist Party members should do more work and make more contributions, but they should not reach out for power, position, and fame. Unity is also very important. After entering the leading cadre team, one should be more mindful of the overall situation, more disciplined, more strict with oneself, and more closely connected with the masses. There should be organizational life within the team, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out seriously and not superficially. The corruption issue, laxity issue, etc., mentioned earlier, should also be grasped from the leading cadre team. For leading cadre teams with serious lack of unity and many problems, the higher-level Party committee should take measures to help solve them. Building a good leading cadre team can make all work vigorous and can bring out a good team and good style.

Sixth, we must solidly grasp the construction of Party grassroots organizations. The various problems facing Party building are largely reflected in the construction of grassroots organizations. This aspect of work is very different whether it is grasped or not. Many typical experiences have proven that as long as it is seriously grasped, problems will be found, solutions will be found, and results will be achieved. Currently, some of our grassroots organizations have insufficient combat effectiveness, and the vanguard and model role of Party members is not fully played, and some have even become paralyzed; but there are indeed some grassroots organizations whose combat effectiveness and the vanguard and model role of Party members have always been played well, and there are some in every place. Moreover, in the past one or two years, there have also been some new experiences, that is, for originally lax Party organizations, once the higher level grasps them, the situation changes. Comrades Qiao Shi and Song Pian have seen some rural areas, and I have also seen that there are indeed some Party organizations where the economy has developed, and the situation in the ideological and political realm is also good, mainly because the Party organization leads the masses to get rich, while the ideological, political, and organizational work of the Party is not relaxed. In some rural areas, once it is said to develop a commodity economy, everyone takes care of their own business, and the branch does not manage. While in some villages, it is the Party organization that leads the masses to get rich, and the prestige of the Party organization in those places is high. Therefore, the key is to grasp it, and to grasp it regularly. One hand grasps the development of the economy, and the other hand grasps the work of the Party and ideological and political work, which can be done. Universities are the same, with some Party organizations in good condition and some not. We should find solutions to problems from good typical experiences, good experiences, including new experiences that have emerged in recent years, to enhance our confidence.

The 13th Party Congress proposed seven regular tasks for grassroots Party organizations: regular education, regular supervision, regular criticism and self-criticism, regular discipline rectification, regular removal of corrupt elements and proper handling of unqualified members, regular recruitment of outstanding members, and regular promotion of positive energy and resistance to negative trends, through the vanguard and model role of Party members to unite the masses around the Party, and make Party grassroots organizations become strong combat fortresses. These regular tasks are very important, and if they are truly done well and institutionalized, the role and prestige of the Party will definitely be improved. Higher-level Party committees should care about the construction of grassroots Party organizations, regularly set topics, and assign tasks to grassroots Party organizations, and grassroots Party organizations should also assign tasks to Party members. Requiring Party grassroots organizations and Party members to play a role, first of all, is to grasp. Without grasping, without tasks, without requirements, without inspections, there will be laxity and even paralysis. In some places, Party members do not play a role, precisely because the branch does not require them to play a role, and the branch does not assign them tasks. Many branches, in the development of commodity economy, require Party members to help the masses get rich, and Party members have tasks and are also happy, and in leading the masses to get rich, their prestige is also improved. It seems that in the problem of the paralysis of Party organizations, the main reason is that we have not seriously grasped it and have not paid attention to giving play to their role.

The organizational life system of the Party must be upheld, which is one of Lenin's principles of Party building, otherwise the Party organization will become loose. Currently, there is a kind of idea that in the period of peaceful construction, the role of the Party organization should be weakened, the leadership of the Party should be weakened, and the organization and discipline should not be emphasized as in the war period. This is wrong. The Central Organization Department has carried out pilot work on democratic evaluation of Party members in many places, that is, according to the conditions of Party members stipulated in the Party Constitution, evaluating whether Party members are qualified in their actual work, and the effect is very good. The feedback from the grassroots level is: "The wind is not big, but the rain is big; the thunder is not big, but the shock is big." Through the organizational life and democratic evaluation of the Party, all Party members can be mobilized to care about the Party, cherish the Party, do the work of the Party, and play a role; it can make criticism and self-criticism fall to the ground, make the supervision within the Party have binding force, be beneficial to the improvement of the quality of Party members, and also be beneficial to the smooth handling of unqualified Party members. In addition, improving the quality of Party members is a key issue in strengthening Party building, and I will not talk about it this time because the Party member education work conference was just held, and that conference mainly solved this problem.

Seventh, let me talk about a few principles. Some comrades ask: Now that we are reforming, it seems that many things are changing, so what cannot be changed? I think the simple answer is two sentences: the four cardinal principles cannot be changed, and the general policy of reform and opening up cannot be changed.

The four cardinal principles cannot be changed. The leadership of the Party must be upheld. The political system should be reformed, but the leadership position of the Communist Party of China cannot be changed, and the specific methods of governance can be changed. The separation of Party and government is about the specific work system, and the improvement and reform of the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation are to strengthen the relationship between the Communist Party and the democratic parties, and it does not mean changing the political leadership of the Party in the country. The socialist system must be upheld. The management system of product economy should be changed to the system of planned commodity economy, and the specific forms of public ownership can be explored, and ownership and management rights should be separated. These are all to better develop productive forces and better give play to the superiority of the socialist system. Individual economy can be developed, and private enterprises can also be developed, but the Chinese economy cannot be privatized, and the dominant position of public ownership cannot be changed. As for the form of public ownership, it can be explored. Marx and Engels did not specify its specific form. We allow non-labor income, but the main form should be distribution according to work, and this cannot be changed. We have adopted a highly centralized management model in the past, which has played a good role, but later the situation has developed, and many problems have been exposed. How to change it? We should explore through practice, summarize experience, and make our public ownership become a form that is conducive to the development of productive forces and full of vitality. The people's democratic dictatorship must be upheld. Democracy should be gradually expanded within the people, but the dictatorship over hostile elements cannot be abandoned. Marxism must be upheld. This, of course, refers to the position, viewpoint, method, and basic principles of Marxism. We must study new situations and solve new problems to make Marxism develop anew and guide China's modernization construction. However, the position, viewpoint, method, and basic principles of Marxism cannot be abandoned. If the four cardinal principles are abandoned, China will definitely be in chaos, and modernization will have no hope.

The general policy of reform and opening up also cannot be changed. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, our country has taken a new step, and the national income has doubled two years ahead of schedule, laying a good foundation for doubling it again by the end of the century. If we do not reform, can we achieve this? To rectify the economic environment and rectify the economic order is to better comprehensively deepen the reform. The specific measures and steps of reform and opening up should be adjusted according to the changes in the situation, but the policy and strategy of reform and opening up cannot be changed. From the perspective of the international and domestic situation, there is no reason to change the general policy of reform and opening up. If the general policy of reform and opening up is abandoned, China will definitely be in chaos, and modernization will have no hope.

By the way, regarding the issue of the criterion of productive forces, this is a scientific concept and should be explained scientifically, and it should not be understood in a simple and vulgar way. For example, relying on equipment to engage in short-term behavior to pursue increased profits is a misinterpretation of the criterion of productive forces and is precisely the destruction of productive forces. Some people say that since we talk about the criterion of productive forces, why do we also talk about changing the productive relations? In the situation where productive relations hinder the development of productive forces, changing the productive relations is an action to uphold the criterion of productive forces. On the contrary, only pursuing the so-called advanced form of productive relations without considering the needs of the development of productive forces will lead to "leftist" errors. We must uphold the criterion of productive forces, but we should not understand the criterion of productive forces in a simple and vulgar way, and we should not equate the criterion of productive forces with profits, output value, and other things.

As for talking about Party building, we must make it clear: the nature of the Party as the vanguard of the working class must be upheld. The three major styles of the Party must be upheld. The organizational principle of democratic centralism and the discipline of the Party must be upheld. The combat effectiveness of the Party's grassroots organizations must be upheld. The management system of cadres should be reformed, and the system of state public officials should be established, but the policy of selecting cadres with both virtue and ability must be upheld. The model role of Party members must be upheld, and the purpose of Party members to serve the people, to strive for the tasks of the current stage, and to struggle for the highest ideal of communism must be upheld. The social policy of the Party is to distribute according to work, to reward more for more work, to implement the principle of material interests, and to encourage hard work and getting rich. However, for Communist Party members, our worldview and values should be to consciously make sacrifices for the country and the people, not to pursue personal interests, and not to "look at everything in terms of money." We need to distinguish between the social policy and the worldview and values of Communist Party members. This worldview and values should also be propagated among the people, of course, we cannot use this worldview and values to require the people, but for Communist Party members, we must require them in this way. In short, we must implement the policy of governing the Party strictly.

Eighth, let me talk about the form of the research class. Holding a research class, gathering responsible cadres, using a not too long period of time, adopting the research method of combining theory with practice, and deeply discussing one or two major issues is a good form. Everyone reflects their feelings and considerations from actual work to the Central Committee, and the considerations of the Central Committee comrades are also exchanged with you, which is beneficial to helping the Central Committee make decisions and improving local work. Comrades who have been engaged in practical work for a long time, taking out a period of time, sitting down, calmly thinking, and discussing with responsible comrades from other regions and departments, is also a gain for individuals. I think this form can continue to be adopted. This time, it is specially for the study of Party building, which will play an important role in promoting the whole Party to pay attention to Party building. In the future, we can continue to hold Party building research classes, and according to the needs, we can also hold research classes on clean governance, political system reform, economic system reform, ideological and political work, etc., to promote work in various aspects. We can gather everyone's wisdom through this form to help the Central Committee make decisions. We can also promote work through this form. At the same time, for the comrades participating in the research class, it is also beneficial to improve themselves. This method does not take much time and is easy to implement.

The Party building in the primary stage of socialism is a big article, and we should use the strength of the whole Party to do this article well. This time, holding a research class can be said to be the beginning, and we should continue to study and grasp it seriously. Last Sunday, I went to the Party School to meet with all the classmates, and then I had three discussions with some provincial and autonomous region Party committee secretaries and old comrades, which was very enlightening to me. Today, I will talk about these points and discuss with comrades. If there are any incorrect points, I hope to hear the criticism of comrades.

　　关于党的建设的几个问题
    ——１９８９年１月２８日在党建研究班上的讲话
    赵紫阳
    党的建设研究班已经办了２４天，讨论得很好。中纪委正在开全国纪律检查工作会议，也开得很好。现在党建研究班的专题讨论还没有结束，我趁这个机会，就当前党的建设中的若干问题讲几点意见，作为我的一个发言，和同志们一起讨论。
    第一点，必须把党的建设摆到各级党委的重要议程上来。党委的工作千条万条，归根到底是两手抓：一手抓发展社会主义商品经济，一手抓思想政治领域的工作，而要抓好思想政治领域的工作，关键是抓好党的建设。我们党是领导全国人民建设有中国特色的社会主义的核心，党把这两手抓住了，抓好了，就能够提纲挈领，驾驭全局。
    为什么这样说？因为我们的社会既不能停滞，又不能动荡。停滞和动荡都不符合十亿中国人民的利益。如果不改革开放，不搞有计划的商品经济，生产力的发展就快不了，我们就无法摆脱贫穷，整个社会的发展也会停滞，跟发达国家的差距就会越拉越大。但在发展社会主义商品经济的同时，如果忽视思想政治领域的工作，各种各样的腐败现象就会滋生蔓延，就会把我们的社会搞得乱糟糟的。如果出现这种情况，改革和建设也很难顺利进行下去。思想政治领域的工作，包括意识形态、新闻舆论、政法工作、廉政建设、群众工作、社会风气等许多方面，都是很重要的，但必须抓住党的建设这个重点和关键。党有了战斗力，思想政治领域的各项工作就有了主心骨。所以，总起来讲，就是三句话：建设有中国特色的社会主义不抓发展社会主义商品经济不行；抓商品经济而不抓思想政治领域的工作不行；抓思想政治领域的工作而不重点抓党的建设也不行。
    十一届三中全会以来，小平同志多次提出要两手抓。小平同志说，“一手就是坚持对外开放和对内搞活经济的政策，一手就是坚决打击经济犯罪活动。”小平同志又说，“一手抓改革开放，一手抓整党”，“一手抓建设，一手抓法制。”这是从不同侧面讲的，意思是一贯的。小平同志还多次讲过，抓打击经济犯罪也好，抓整党也好，抓法制也好，都是为了保证改革开放能够顺利进行。没有这一手，我们的改革开放就很难搞好，很难顺利地进行。我理解，两手抓是一个非常重要的理论问题，也是在实际工作中必须牢牢掌握的一个非常重要的方针。社会主义初级阶段的基本路线是一个中心、两个基本点。党委的工作要围绕一个中心来两手抓，促进物质文明和精神文明的建设。两手抓中的思想政治领域这一手，很重要的一条是为了防止腐败现象。因为改革开放确实带来了一种腐败的危险，一定要看到这一点。我们说，现在的一些问题并不是改革开放直接带来的，但改革、开放、搞活的环境，确实存在着滋生腐败的危险，也就是有土壤、有温床、有空隙。因噎废食，怕有腐败的危险，就不改革、开放、搞活，怕苍蝇进来而不打开窗户，或者打开了又关上，是不对的。但是窗户打开了，飞进了苍蝇不去扑灭，也是不行的。十年的实践已经证明，我们党所执行的一整套改革、开放、搞活的方针政策是能够促进生产力发展的。尽管在经济工作方面，人民群众有这样那样的意见，但我看改革、开放、搞活促进了社会生产力发展这一条，绝大多数人是公认的，是有目共睹的。如果我们在发展社会主义商品经济的同时，能够把社会上的腐败现象减少到最低限度，有中国特色的社会主义就能更充分地显示出它的优越性。我觉得应该这样看：我们只有在促进生产力较快发展的同时，又能够防止腐败现象的蔓延，才能充分显示出我们路线的正确、制度的优越。我们的经济应该是富有活力的经济，我们的政治应该是良好而安定的政治，两者密切结合，就有可能以较少的代价和较快的步伐，求得中华民族的振兴。
    第二点，对党的现状的估计。同志们讨论得很热烈，列举了大量的事实，从各个角度进行了分析。我看基本估计是一致的，就是要从两个方面来看问题，不能只从一个方面来看问题。这是毛主席历来提倡的方法。十年大发展是在党的领导下进行的。党的路线是正确的。各方面的工作都有不少新的创造。党的各级组织在总体上是有战斗力的。绝大多数党员是为人民努力工作的。这些都是基本的不容抹煞的事实。如果我们的党是漆黑一团的，过去的成绩怎么能够取得呢？将来的希望又在什么地方呢？这是一方面。另一方面，必须看到党内确实存在着腐败和涣散的现象。这些消极的东西，正在腐蚀党的肌体，损害党和群众的联系，危害党的事业。我赞成同志们说的，要动态地看问题。就是说，对我们党的现状作出估计后，还要看今后党究竟会怎么样。现在我们党的主流是好的，但有许多消极现象在发展，在滋长。采取正确的方针，我们党今后就会沿着正确的、健康的方向继续发展下去；如果采取另一种方针，那就会是另外一种结果。所以要从动态上来看问题。如果放任下去，听之任之，是会泛滥成灾的。这是一种可能性，是我们一定要避免的坏的可能性。我们必须做到的，是实现好的可能性，这就是正视问题，从严治党，认真地坚持不懈地同这些腐败涣散的因素作斗争。这样，党就能进一步巩固，党同群众的联系就能进一步加强，党的事业的发展就有了坚强的保证。
    为什么一方面是党的事业的大发展，另一方面又存在着相当严重、不容忽视的问题？乔石同志在研究班开学的时候讲，我们党正处在一个历史性的大转变时期。这个话讲得很好，指出了观察党的状况、研究党的建设的大背景。我们研究党的状况，一定不要忘记党处在历史性的大转变时期这样一个客观事实。回顾我们党的历史，凡是在历史性的大转变时期，都出现过类似的现象：有的对党的路线迷惑不解；有的经不起新的考验。日本帝国主义侵略中国，阶级矛盾下降，民族矛盾上升，从十年内战转变为国共合作，就有人对统一战线的政策想不通，也有人经不起统一战线环境的考验。进城也是这样，从革命战争转变为和平建设，有人经不起糖衣炮弹的侵袭，也有人满足于“三十亩地一头牛，老婆孩子热炕头”，退坡了。现在的转变，正如小平同志所说的，可以称之为又一次革命。从产品经济到有计划商品经济的转变，从封闭到开放的转变，涉及到社会生活的各个方面。有人不理解，有人经不起考验，同样也是不足为怪的。唯其如此，我们就应该更加重视党的建设。大转变是对每一个党员的考验，也是对我们整个党的考验。客观的考验是严峻的，因此，从主观上讲，我们必须坚持从严治党的方针，对党员提出更高更严的要求。在严峻的考验面前，必然会有一部分党员被淘汰，但我们的党和党的事业必将继续向前发展。我们党在以往６８年的斗争中，胜利地通过了多次严峻的考验，推动了中国历史的发展；现在和今后，也一定能够胜利地经受改革开放和发展商品经济的考验，并推动中国的社会主义现代化的历史进程。全党对此应有充分的精神准备和足够的信心。
    毛主席在《〈共产党人〉发刊词》中反复论证了一个极其重要的观点，这就是我们党的建设过程，党的失败和胜利，党的后退和前进，党的缩小和扩大，党的发展和巩固，都不能不密切地联系于党的政治路线。
    一句话，党的建设一定要联系于党的政治路线，不能离开党的政治路线。这是我们在党的建设上的最宝贵的经验。党的十三大和十三届三中全会在谈到党的建设问题的时候，都着重指出了这个指导思想。我们党内当前存在的各种问题，归根到底，是党的状况的某些方面同党的路线不够适应，或者很不适应。从当前的实际情况看，我们进行党的建设，需要紧紧抓住三个问题：廉洁问题，党内的凝聚力问题和党在群众中的吸引力问题。这三个都是重大的政治问题。只要我们的队伍是纯洁的，步调是一致的，又能把广大群众紧紧地团结在自己的周围，我们党就能立于不败之地。
    第三点，保持党政机关廉洁是当前党的建设的一项极为重要的任务。经济越是繁荣，商品经济越是活跃，共产党员在保持廉洁方面的觉悟就应该越高，党的纪律对这一方面的要求和约束也应该越严。我们是在开放的条件下发展商品经济，而且为了发展商品经济，我们也需要研究资本主义国家在这方面的许多成功的经验，但是我们决不是学习资本主义私有制，决不能羡慕和模仿由资本主义私有制的发展而造成的损人利己、贪婪、欺诈和其他一切坏东西。在商品经济的一定发展阶段上，有些社会现象是难于完全避免的。经济搞活了，内外交往扩大了，人、财、物都广泛地流动起来了，在这种情况下，要把社会治安、社会秩序、社会风气管得像过去那样“净化”，确实难度很大，需要有一个法制建设的过程，需要有一个人的素质提高的过程，需要不断地总结和积累经验。但是，对党政机关应该管严。现在政府机关工作人员中，６９％是共产党员；担负领导职务的人员中，共产党员的比例更大。共产党员不仅应该以廉洁自律，而且应该成为维护廉洁、反对腐败的最勇敢最坚决的力量。热心于发展社会主义商品经济，就应该热心于建立社会主义商品经济新秩序。借发展商品经济混水摸鱼，利用行使公共权力之机索贿受贿、弄权谋私，是破坏改革开放的害群之马，是违反国法党纪的蠹虫。共产党员，工作能力有大小，认识水平有高低，但是，必须以为人民服务为宗旨，决不能犯拿权力同金钱作交易这种性质的错误，如果犯了，就玷污了共产党员的称号。我们所以要把党政机关管严，不仅是党的性质、政府的性质有这个要求，而且这也是制止腐败现象在社会上蔓延的最有效的办法。所谓腐败问题，当前主要表现为拿权力同金钱作交易。社会上有些人需要通过利用掌握权力的人取得方便，而掌握权力的人主要在党政机关，其中有些人又想以手中的权力为自己谋求私利。这种现象，一般讲，许多国家在商品经济发展的一定阶段都很突出，特别是在法制不健全的时候。但是，我们是社会主义国家，党和政府应当而且有能力把腐败现象减少到最低限度，绝不能听其泛滥。我们把党政机关，包括执法部门和公用事业单位管严，把这些部门存在的问题真正解决好，遏制住权力同金钱交易的现象，就可以制止腐败现象在社会上蔓延。
    中央书记处最近讨论了廉政问题，认为这是从严治党的一个重大问题，是一个严肃的政治问题。这个问题需要综合治理。当前要着重抓两件事。一件是认真查处案件，凡是有线索的一定要查到水落石出，凡是违反国法党纪的一定要严惩不贷。涉及法纪政纪的，当然要由国家司法机关和政府监察机关查处。但是，对有关的共产党员还必须绳之以党纪，党纪的要求应该比政纪、法纪更严。这是党的各级纪委当前的中心工作。从事党的纪律检查工作的同志，责任重大，一定要铁面无私，坚持原则。再一件是加强制度建设，特别是直接为居民、为企业办事的行政部门和公用事业单位，一定要加强制度建设。办事的规章要公开，办事的结果也要公开，接受群众的监督。照章办事和公开办事是建立社会主义商品经济新秩序的一大建设，也是社会主义民主政治的一大建设。行政部门和公用事业单位的党组织，应该在本单位的制度建设方面充分发挥作用。这项工作，难度很大。但是，北京东城区、上海黄浦区、山东郯城、河北藁城等试点单位的经验已经证明，只要认真去做，坚持下去，逐步完善，必有成效。山东姜春云同志对乔石、宋平同志和我说，他们的郯城、昌乐抓得很有效果，群众反映非常强烈，而抓的时间并不长。可见，廉政建设这件事说难也难，但抓和不抓大不一样。河北邢台抓廉政，几个月时间就有了变化。所以关键还是要坚决去抓。领导态度坚决，亲自去抓，带头去抓，方法也就会出来。抓什么？从人们关心的、意见最多的、议论最多的热点问题抓起，逐步地扩大。现在下面还是有新鲜经验的。总之，把查处案件和制度建设这两件事抓好了，既能防范于前，又能惩戒于后，我们党就有了反腐蚀的机制和能力。
    第四点，必须从思想上组织上加强党的内部的凝聚力。在中国的大地上，只要我们党内不出大的问题，国家就不会出大的问题，出了问题也有力量解决。这就是上一次我在党校座谈时说的那句话：我们中国的问题，关键还在我们共产党身上。我们党是中国改革和现代化建设的领导力量，是国内政局稳定的主导因素。全党４７００万党员，多数是社会的优秀分子。全党团结，没有什么困难不能克服。那些不喜欢我们党的人，稍微现实一点的，也知道无法从外部取代我们，摧毁我们。他们寄希望于我们内部涣散。中国人长期被讥为“一盘散沙”，孙中山力图改变这种状况，他没有做到。我们党由于有正确的理想、理论、政策和工作，由于有强大的献身精神和严格的纪律，把全国人民团结起来了，使中国革命得到了成功。
    陈云同志关于党的建设问题讲过一句言简意赅的很深刻的话：要使每个共产党员时刻记住自己是个共产党员。我理解，记住自己是个共产党员，就是要增强党的观念，执行党的路线，遵守党的纪律，维护党的原则。大家都这样做，党就能巩固，否则势必涣散。我们的党很大，这么多党员，分布在各个方面，岗位不同，有的在中央，有的在地方，有的在党委机关，有的在政府、人大、政协、群众团体，有的在企业、学校、农村。但是，大家都应该时刻记住自己是个共产党员，都有义务执行党的路线，遵守党的纪律，维护党的原则，增强党的观念。这样，我们的方向、目标、步调就能一致，党就有战斗力。要做到这一点，就得靠党的思想建设和组织建设。其中，首先是思想建设，也就是用党的十三大的理论和路线来武装全党。这次党建研究班在讨论中，也把这个问题很突出地提出来了，说明大家的认识是一致的，都看出了这个问题的重要性。
    十三大的路线有两个基本点。反对四项基本原则或反对改革开放，是党的政治纪律所不能允许的。绝大多数党员都懂得这个道理，是拥护党的路线的。但党内确也存在着模糊观念，对改革开放缺乏充分的思想准备。有的对改革开放的必要性缺乏思想准备，不大了解这是发挥社会主义制度优越性的必由之路。有的对改革的艰巨性和长期性缺乏思想准备，希望改革的路直而又直，走得快而又快。有的对改革必然会付出代价和遇到困难缺乏思想准备，幻想每一项改革措施都能对每一个人立即带来巨大的、直线上升的利益，遇到困难就灰心丧气。这些都是导致思想涣散的因素。还有一些人，看问题的方法不对，过去在封闭状态下，不了解国外的情况，现在开放了，把中国同发达国家一比，好像社会主义不行了。其实，要比，应该看两条，一条是看社会制度，再一条是看发展阶段。离开发展阶段，就会得出错误的结论，好像一切问题都是社会制度带来的，好像社会主义就不如资本主义了。应当如实地看到，在人均国民生产总值几百美元这样的水平上作比较，在社会安定、分配公平、生活质量、教育水平、卫生条件、社会福利、民主和法制的建设等各个方面，从总体上说，我们的状况比处在同一经济发展水平的实行资本主义制度的国家好。且不说我们有十亿人口，有更多的困难。和我们处于同一发展水平、人均国民收入几百美元的资本主义国家，没有一个不是贫富悬殊，社会不公，政局动荡。可以放眼去观察，可以去比。还有一种比法，把我们同欧洲、美国、日本比，这种比法不是科学的、客观的，因为我们原来就落后，不是现在才落后。他们经过一百多年、两百多年的发展，其中还包括殖民掠夺的阶段。怎么能将两个不同发展阶段相比呢？改革开放以来，我们在经济发展的速度上和综合国力的提高上是领先的，这是公认的事实。将来，到了我国人均国民生产总值达到中等发达国家水平时，我们的社会状况在许多方面会比中等发达的资本主义国家好，甚至在某些方面有可能比最发达的资本主义国家好。不同社会制度国家的对比，只能用同等经济发展阶段的实际水平比，不能把不同的发展阶段与不同的社会制度混淆起来。我们处在比较落后的发展阶段，这不能怨天尤人，更不应归结到社会制度上，而应该发愤图强，同心同德执行十三大的路线。十三大路线集中到一点，就是要解决在社会主义制度下如何更快地发展生产力的问题。现在，大家对我们落后的状况不满，我看不需要开什么新的药方了，就是认真地、老老实实地执行十三大路线，发愤图强。尽管十三大的理论、路线还要充实、完善、发展，但只有坚决贯彻十三大的理论和路线，才能在社会主义制度下促进生产力的发展。别的药方都不符合中国的实际。这一点，全党必须坚定不移，首先是各级领导要坚定不移，不能摇摇摆摆，不要受这样那样错误思潮的干扰。十三大的理论和路线的教育，应该结合形势教育去做，要做得很认真，深入细致，生动活泼，有针对性，有说服力。老问题解决了，新问题又会产生，这个热点问题解决了，还会产生别的热点问题。党内的模糊认识是经常会有的，需要经常澄清，及时澄清，这样才能使党经常保持强大的凝聚力。
    强调党的凝聚力，同发扬民主是统一的。党内民主的发扬，是增强党的凝聚力的强大因素；而党的凝聚力的增强，又可以提高我们的承受能力，成为进一步发扬社会民主的必要条件。在新形势下，必须更好地贯彻党的民主集中制。扩大党内民主，是为了使党在伟大斗争中充满活力，胜任愉快，是为了巩固党的队伍和推进党的事业，充分有效地执行党的最高领导机关——党的全国代表大会和它所产生的中央委员会的决议。对于共产党员来说，如果以民主为借口，给党的形象和党的路线抹黑，损害党的事业，那是党的民主集中制和党的纪律所不能允许的。
    第五点，一定要加强党的领导，同时努力改善党的领导。改善党的领导，才能增强党在群众中的吸引力。吸引力大，党就能更好地实现领导。党的内部要讲凝聚力，党对非党群众要讲吸引力和说服力，这样，党才能有强大的战斗力。在改革开放条件下做群众工作，要适应社会主义民主政治建设的要求，学会新本领。毛主席讲过，“所谓领导权，不是要一天到晚当作口号去高喊，也不是盛气凌人地要人家服从我们，而是以党的正确政策和自己的模范工作，说服和教育党外人士，使他们愿意接受我们的建议。”毛主席的这段话，对如何实现党的领导讲得很好，我们应该悉心体会。这就需要更高的领导艺术。战争年代尚且应该如此，和平建设时期我们更应该努力这样去做。
    共产党的领导是全中国人民的根本利益所在。中国不能搞西方那种多党制。在中国搞反对党，既无条件，也无需要。在我们国家里，有共产党，还有八个民主党派，共产党和民主党派的关系，不是执政党和反对党的关系。我们党和民主党派都赞成实行共产党领导的多党合作制和政治协商制。这种制度，是历史形成的，符合我们的国情，已经起了很好的作用，今后还会起更好的作用，是我们社会主义初级阶段的政治格局的基本内容之一。在新的历史时期，多党合作和政治协商的内容要进一步充实，形式要进一步完善。这要根据实际条件一步一步走，要靠我们党和各民主党派共同努力。政治体制改革，决不是取消我们党的领导的大格局，而是要更充分地发挥这个大格局的优势，使我们党和民主党派之间合作得更好，更亲密，更有成效。
    十三大以来，党政分开有明显的进展。这是正确的，有利于改善和加强党的领导。县以上各级党委从日常行政事务和经济事务中摆脱出来，可以更好地履行政治领导的职能，集中力量抓改革，抓党的建设。党的政治领导，很重要的是重大方针政策的领导。有的同志提出什么叫“重大”？我们说中央同地方党委的职能、权力不同，但都负有在重大方针政策方面实行政治领导的责任。地方各级党委具体怎么做，可以在实践中探索、研究。改革是统揽全局的，各级党委应责无旁贷地抓起来，抓好。党要真正管党。这个问题讲了多年，没有得到很好解决，除了思想认识方面的原因外，同过去党政不分的体制有很大的关系。党政分开以后，在国家机关、群众团体工作的党员同志应该和在党委机关工作的同志一道，共同执行党的路线、方针和政策，来体现党的领导作用。改革涉及到各方面关系的调整，在这种情况下，更应该强调相互之间的谅解、支援和友谊。《企业法》颁布以来，不少企业在理顺党政关系方面创造了很好的经验。各级党委要注意总结推广他们的经验，使更多的企业党组织能够坚定不移地按照《企业法》和中央的《通知》的规定，转变自己的职能。企业党组织应当真正把本企业的党员管好，使党员（包括担任行政工作的共产党员）都能起作用，都按党的政策和原则办事，都按国家的法律和计划办事，都密切联系群众，把保证和监督的任务担当起来。
    加强党的领导的一个重要问题，是加强党的各级领导班子的建设。各级领导班子的状况如何，对党的事业关系极大。党的十一届三中全会以来，我们在领导班子建设方面做了大量的工作。现在的各级领导班子，基本上是好的。当然，由于缺乏经验，也存在一些问题。一是有些年轻干部原来是搞技术、专业的，不熟悉党的工作；一是在年龄结构上档次没有拉开，如不注意，将来会出现一起退、一起换的问题。现在不能再来搞大的变动，只能在经常工作中逐步调整、改善。总的来看，现在需要注意稳定和提高。鉴于新成分大量增加，当前在领导班子建设上要特别强调学习和团结。学习非常重要，包括在实践中学习。进了领导班子，就必须认真学习身为领导班子成员所必须掌握的东西。我们不要教条主义，也不要经验主义，但是一定要理论联系实际地学马列，学党的基本理论和基本路线，学党的方针政策，学党的基本知识。要结合实际工作，反复深入地学。在领导班子里的同志，还要增强党性锻炼，加强党的观念，解决好个人同党的关系。有一些年轻干部有开拓精神，很能干，但由于缺乏党性锻炼，在对待名、位、权的问题上，缺乏正确的态度。共产党员应该多做工作，多做贡献，但不能伸手要权、要位、要名。团结也非常重要。进了领导班子，应该更顾大局，更守纪律，更严格要求自己，更密切联系群众。班子内部应该有组织生活制度，认真地而不是敷衍地开展批评与自我批评。前面说的廉洁问题、涣散问题等等，都应该从领导班子抓起。对严重不团结和问题比较多的领导班子，上级党委要采取措施帮助解决。把领导班子建设好，各项工作都可以开展得生气勃勃，也可以把好的队伍、好的作风带出来。
    第六点，扎扎实实抓好党的基层组织建设。党的建设面临的各种问题，大量地体现在基层组织的建设上。这方面的工作，抓与不抓大不一样。许多典型经验证明，只要认真去抓，就会发现问题，就会找到办法，就会取得成效。现在我们有些基层组织，战斗堡垒作用发挥不够，党员的先锋模范作用发挥不够，有的甚至瘫痪了；但也确有一些基层组织战斗堡垒作用、党员先锋模范作用一直发挥得比较好，各地都有一些。而且，最近一两年来，还有一些新经验，就是对原来涣散的党组织，上面一抓，情况就变了。乔石、宋平同志看过一些农村，我也见到确有一些党组织，那里经济发展了，思想政治方面的情况也好，主要是党组织带领群众致富，同时党的思想、政治、组织工作不放松。有的农村，一说要发展商品经济，就各顾各的，支部不管。而有的村子是党组织带领群众致富，那里的党组织威信就高。所以，关键是要抓，而且要经常抓。一手抓发展经济，一手抓党的工作、思想政治工作，是可以做到的。大学也一样，有些党组织的状况好，有些不行。要从好的典型、好的经验、包括近几年出现的新经验中，找到解决问题的途径，增强我们的信心。
    十三大提出了基层党组织的七项经常工作：经常地进行教育，经常地加强监督，经常地开展批评与自我批评，经常地整顿纪律，经常地清除腐败分子和妥善处置不合格分子，经常地吸收优秀分子，经常地发扬正气和抵制歪风，通过党员的先锋模范作用把群众团结在党的周围，使党的基层组织成为坚强的战斗堡垒。这些经常性的工作十分重要，真正做好了，并使之形成制度，党的作用和威信就一定会提高。上级党委，要关心基层党组织的建设，要经常出题目，给基层党组织分配任务，基层党组织也应给党员分配任务。要求党的基层组织和党员起作用，首先要抓。不抓，没有任务，没有要求，没有检查，就会涣散甚至瘫痪。有的地方，党员不起作用，就是因为支部没有要求他们起作用，支部没有给他们分配任务。好多支部，在发展商品经济中，要求党员帮助群众致富，党员有了任务，也很高兴，在带领群众致富中也就提高了威信。看来在党组织瘫痪的问题上主要是我们没有认真去抓，没有注意发挥他们的作用。
    党的组织生活制度必须坚持，这是列宁提出的建党原则之一，否则党的组织就会松松垮垮。现在有一种思想，认为在和平建设时期，要淡化党组织的作用，淡化党的领导，不能像战争时期那样，强调组织，强调纪律。这是错误的。中央组织部在不少地方进行了民主评议党员的试点，即按照党章规定的党员的条件，对照党员在实际工作中所起的作用，评议党员是否合格，效果很好。下面的反映是：“风声不大雨点大，雷声不大震动大”。通过党的组织生活和民主评议，可以动员全体党员都来关心党，爱护党，都来做党的工作，都来起作用；可以使批评与自我批评落到实处，使党内的监督有约束力，有利于党员素质的提高，也有利于顺利地处置不合格的党员。另外，提高党员素质是加强党的建设的一个关键问题，这次我就不讲了，因为刚刚开了党员教育工作会议，那个会议主要解决的就是这个问题。
    第七点，讲几个原则问题。有的同志问：现在搞改革，好像很多东西都在变，究竟有哪些不能变？我想，简要的回答就是两句话：四项基本原则不能变，改革开放的总方针不能变。
    四项基本原则不能变。党的领导作用必须坚持。政治体制要改革，中国共产党的执政地位是不能改的，执政的具体方式则是可以改变的。党政分开是讲具体的工作体制，充实和改进多党合作制和政治协商制是为了密切共产党与民主党派的关系，丝毫不意味着改变党在全国人民中的政治领导作用。社会主义制度必须坚持。产品经济的管理体制要改为有计划的商品经济的体制，公有制的具体形式可以探索，所有权和经营权应该分离，这些都是为了更好地发展生产力，更好地发挥社会主义制度的优越性。可以发展个体经济，也可以发展私人企业，但中国经济不能私有化，公有制的主体地位和主导地位不能变。至于公有制形式，可以探讨，马克思、恩格斯并没有规定它的具体形式。我们允许非劳动收入，但按劳分配应该是主要的形式，这也不能变。我们过去采用过于集中的管理模式，曾经起过好的作用，但后来情况发展了，暴露出不少弊病。怎么改呢？要通过实践，总结经验，使我们的公有制成为一种有利于生产力发展的、充满活力的形式。人民民主专政必须坚持。人民内部应该逐步扩大民主，但对敌对分子实行专政不能丢。马克思主义必须坚持。这当然是指马克思主义的立场、观点、方法和基本原理。必须研究新情况，解决新问题，使马克思主义得到新的发展，指导中国的现代化建设。但是马克思主义的立场、观点、方法不能丢，基本原理不能丢。把四项基本原则丢掉了，中国一定大乱，现代化就没有希望。
    改革开放的总方针也不能变。党的十一届三中全会以来，我们的国家上了一个新的台阶，国民生产总值提前两年翻了一番，为到本世纪末翻两番打下了良好的基础。如果不改革，能做到吗？治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，是为了更好地全面深化改革。改革开放的具体措施和步骤应该随着形势的变化有所调整，但改革开放的方针和战略不能变。从国际国内形势看，都没有理由改变改革开放的总方针。把改革开放的总方针丢掉了，中国也一定大乱，现代化也没有希望。
    顺便说一下，关于生产力标准问题，这是一个科学的概念，要进行科学的阐述，不能作简单化、庸俗化的理解。比如靠拚设备，搞短期行为，来追求增加利润，这是曲解生产力标准，恰恰是破坏生产力。有人说既然讲生产力标准，为什么又要搞生产关系的变革？在生产关系阻碍了生产力发展的情况下，改变生产关系，这是坚持生产力标准的行动。反过来，只是追求生产关系的所谓高级形式，而不顾生产力发展的需要，那就会犯“左”的错误。我们必须坚持生产力标准，但不能简单化、庸俗化地理解生产力标准，不能把生产力标准同利润、产值等简单划等号。
    至于讲到党的建设，必须明确：党的工人阶级先锋队的性质必须坚持。党的三大作风必须坚持。党的民主集中制的组织原则和党的纪律必须坚持。党的基层组织的战斗堡垒作用必须坚持。干部管理制度要改革，国家公务员制度要建立，但德才兼备的干部政策必须坚持。党员的模范作用必须坚持，党员为人民服务、为实现现阶段的任务、为共产主义的最高理想而奋斗的宗旨必须坚持。党的社会政策是按劳分配，多劳多得，实行物质利益原则，鼓励勤劳致富。但是，对于共产党员来说，我们的世界观和价值观，应当是自觉地为国家为人民作奉献，而不是追逐个人利益，不能“一切向钱看”。我们需要把社会政策同共产党员的世界观、价值观区别开来。这种世界观、价值观也要在人民群众中宣传，当然，不能用这种世界观、价值观去要求人民群众，但对共产党员则必须这样要求。总之，要贯彻从严治党的方针。
    第八点，讲一讲研究班这种形式。办研究班，把负责干部集中起来，用不太长的时间，采取理论同实际相结合的研究方法，深入讨论一两个重大问题，这是一种好形式。大家把实际工作中的感受和考虑向中央反映，中央同志的考虑也同你们交流，这对帮助中央决策和改进地方工作都有好处。长期做实际工作的同志，抽出一段时间，坐下来，冷静地思考思考，同其他地区、其他部门的负责同志一起讨论讨论，对个人也是一种收获。我看这种形式可以继续采用。这次是专门研究党的建设，对推动全党重视党的建设会起重要作用。将来，可以继续办党建研究班，也可以根据需要，开办廉政建设研究班、政治体制改革研究班、经济体制改革研究班、思想政治工作研究班等等，推动各方面的工作。可以通过这种形式，集中大家的智慧，帮助中央决策。也可以通过这种形式，来推动工作。同时，对参加研究班的同志来讲，也有利于提高。这个办法，花的时间不长，也易于实行。
    社会主义初级阶段的党的建设是一篇大文章，我们要用全党的力量来做好这篇文章。这次办研究班，可以说是破题，还要继续研究，认真去抓。上星期日我到党校同全班同志见了面，前后又找一些省、自治区党委书记和老同志座谈了三次，对我也很有启发。今天就谈这些，和同志们一起研究，讲得不对的地方，希望听到同志们的批评。
