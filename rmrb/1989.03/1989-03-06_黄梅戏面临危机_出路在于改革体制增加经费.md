Huangmei Opera is currently facing a crisis. The staff of Anhui Province Huangmei Opera Theatre hope to quickly reform the theatre's system and increase necessary funding to revitalize Huangmei Opera, a renowned opera genre nationwide.

Upon entering the courtyard of Anhui Province Huangmei Opera Theatre, the following scene unfolds:

Two rows of dilapidated, makeshift plastic temporary buildings, crammed with performers and staff. On the wall hangs a striking couplet: Two rows of houses leaning east and west, a nest of people with southern and northern accents.

Inside three small rooms, the administrative departments of the theatre and the two troupes, along with personnel from security, administration, business, general affairs, document management, and other aspects, are all squeezed in.

The rehearsal hall built in the 1950s has been converted into dormitories, each room only 14 square meters, housing four performers who can only enter and exit sideways...

Funds are severely lacking. The theatre currently has 206 employees and 16 retirees. The annual lump-sum funding allocated by higher authorities is only 268,000 yuan, enough to cover only 11 months of basic salaries. There are no other subsidies. Last summer, during a 40-degree heatwave, those who persisted in working could not enjoy the necessary heat relief. Due to rising prices, the cost of performances has doubled, resulting in "small performances mean small losses, big performances mean big losses, no performances mean no losses." By the end of November last year, to meet the demands of the audience, the theatre had already performed 180 shows, filmed three television dramas, recorded one radio drama, and produced a batch of cassette tapes. The social impact was good, but the theatre was in debt.

The facilities are of poor quality and quantity, and are not well-matched. The theatre lacks a canteen, bathrooms, and other public welfare facilities, and even lacks practice rooms and rehearsal halls. Many performers, having nothing to do, return home.

Many performers and staff have sought transfers, and a batch of well-known performers have become the target of competition from other provinces.

The Huangmei Opera Theatre, mired in difficulties, has its artistic productivity constrained. There is no money to premiere new plays, and existing plays lack the means to be improved. Artistically, it is difficult to make any progress. At the first China Drama Festival, the nationally renowned Huangmei Opera did not have a place, which is a great regret!

Where is the way out for Huangmei Opera Theatre? The theatre's leadership hopes to accelerate the pace of theatre system reform, liberate artistic productivity, and increase necessary funds. Famous performer Ma Lan said, she hopes that leaders at all levels will pay attention and that the whole nation will support Huangmei Opera, allowing this artistic gem to bloom brilliantly.

### 黄梅戏面临危机  出路在于改革体制增加经费

　　黄梅戏面临危机
    出路在于改革体制增加经费
    本报讯  黄梅戏目前面临危机，安徽省黄梅戏剧院同仁希望尽快改革剧院体制，增加必要经费，振兴黄梅戏这一闻名全国的剧种。
    步入安徽省黄梅戏剧院大院，映入眼帘的是这样一组镜头：
    两排破烂不堪的简易塑料活动房，里面挤满演职员。墙上有副醒目的对联：两排东倒西歪屋，一窝南腔北调人。
    三间小屋里，里面挤着一个院部两个团部和人事、保卫、行政、业务、总务、文印方面的办公人员。
    五十年代建的排练场也隔成了宿舍，每间仅１４平方米，住着４个演员，人只能侧身进出……
    经费严重短缺。剧院现有在职人员２０６人，离退休人员１６人，上级拨给剧院的全年包干经费仅２６．８万元，只够发１１个月的基本工资。其它补贴一概全无。去年夏天持续４０度高温，坚持工作的同志也无法享受应有的防暑降温的待遇。由于物价上涨，演出投资成倍增加，形成“小演小赔、大演大赔、不演不赔”。去年剧院为满足广大观众的需求，至１１月底，已演出１８０场，并拍摄了三部电视剧、录制一部广播剧和一批盒式音带。社会效果不错，而剧院债台高筑。
    设施质低量少不配套，剧院没有食堂、浴室等公共福利设施，连练功房、排练场也没有，许多演员没事干，只得回家。
    不少演职员纷纷联系外调，一批知名演员都成为外省争抢的对象。
    陷入困境的黄梅戏剧院，艺术生产力被束缚，新剧目无钱开排，原有剧目无力提高，艺术上难图寸进。首届中国戏剧节，作为闻名全国的黄梅戏没有一席之地，不能不说是一大悲哀！
    黄梅戏剧院的出路在哪里？剧院领导希望加快剧院体制改革步伐，解放艺术生产力，增加必要的经费。著名演员马兰说，她希望各级领导都来重视，全民都来支持黄梅戏，让这朵艺苑奇葩大放异彩。
