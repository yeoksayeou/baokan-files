In 1984, when the news of Japan establishing the Fan Zeng Art Museum reached me, I had not yet met Fan Zeng in person. However, I was deeply moved by the news. In Japan, only two foreign artists have had museums built in their honor. One is the Picasso Museum standing in Hakone; the other is the Fan Zeng Museum standing in Okayama. At that time, Fan Zeng was only 45 years old. I was proud of my contemporary. This generation of intellectuals, having endured countless hardships and difficulties, still stood firmly on the earth, displaying their extraordinary talents and wisdom. This talent and wisdom, after being tempered in the crucible of pain, once unleashed, shone so brilliantly and possessed such a powerful force of thought and art.

At that time, a friend told me that the artistic eyes of a foreign country had recognized Fan Zeng's value, while we seemed not to have. I replied, "Yes, aesthetic judgment indeed requires distance. Foreign lands, with their spatial distance, purify the worldly prejudices and impurities in the eyes of aesthetic judgment, seeing the beauty and sincerity in the paintings. As for us, although we lack spatial distance, we still need some temporal distance to recognize its value. I believe that the farther the distance, the clearer we will see that this son of China, born in Nantong, Jiangsu Province, who loves to shout 'reconstruct the national spirit,' has created true Chinese paintings. On the soft and smooth xuan paper, he has condensed the eternal Chinese spirit and Chinese artistic spirit. This painter, who embraces the history and land of his motherland, expresses his eternal love for his homeland and depicts the indomitable spirit of China. It is this unyielding soul that supports the sky of our nation.

I have heard many debates about Fan Zeng, but none of them can erase the charm of Fan Zeng's art from my heart. This is the power of beauty, the irresistible power of human wisdom objectified. In my moments of distress, I have often lingered in front of Fan Zeng's paintings, finding spiritual liberation and elevation. The demon-quelling Zhong Kui, the wandering Qu Yuan by the marsh, the brave Ji Kang facing danger, the meditating Bodhidharma, the horse-riding Cao Cao by the river, the contemplating monk Hui Neng, all are connected to the vast universe, filled with emotions, and all have a spirit of transcendence and dignity.

In these historical figure paintings, I discovered something that resonates with my soul, which is the pride of being human. The recklessness that is not buried by mediocrity, the purity that is not swallowed by the muddy stream, the character that is not bowed by power, the breast that is not stained by dust, and the talents bestowed by nature, the individuality and genius nurtured in the great mother's womb—is there any of these not a priceless asset? Why should we belittle ourselves? Why should we suppress our inner pride? Fan Zeng cannot tolerate this suppression, cannot tolerate self-deprecation and self-slavery. Therefore, in his brushstrokes, he infuses deep affection and belief in people, uniquely showcasing human charm and proving human pride. Fan Zeng's paintings, with their strength and emotion penetrating the paper, are ultimately the result of human self-confidence and pride penetrating the paper.

A great artist's level of thought and art should not be the average level of the nation. Naturally, it should be higher than this average, and his works should serve as a beacon to illuminate the national spirit. Therefore, when many souls are still immersed in slave mentality and petty bourgeois ideology, when many confused souls have nothing to cling to, the artist needs to stand tall with a strong backbone, with the power of great transcendence, surging in art. "Poetic thoughts should be like a horse running on the sky's shore," he should leap into the great transformation and then gallop in art. At this time, his art will show a strong personality and outstanding uniqueness. The success of Fan Zeng's painting art lies in his breaking through the average level of national thought, not flattering the vulgar, and with an independent spirit, excavating the pride within human hearts, firmly stepping into realms where no one has gone before. I believe that in the human world, all those who have lost their pride and fallen into despair will find enlightenment in Fan Zeng's paintings.

I admire Mr. Qian Zhongshu, who has given very high praise to Fan Zeng's paintings. He praised Fan Zeng's paintings as "art of the highest grade, transforming people into their spiritual bodies." When I learned of this evaluation, I was deeply moved and congratulated Fan Zeng. What a rare evaluation! Mr. Qian Zhongshu, as a great scholar of our time, does not easily praise others. His praise is truly precious and accurate.

Fan Zeng's figure paintings indeed deserve the highest praise. In a lyrical poem, he wrote about himself: "Painting has been my life's work, thousands and thousands of times, even if it means pulling out my tendons and breaking my bones, it is worth it." Since his youth, he has been diligently reading and painting, and by the age of 20, he had already suffered from deformed ribs and spine due to overwork. Later, for decades, he traveled tirelessly, learning from ancient masters and nature, struggling through hardships on his path of seeking truth, and never stopping. His paintings, of the highest grade, are the essence of his multiple ordeals. He paints every figure, borrowing the spirits of ancient heroes, to express his vast and profound feelings. Thus, he pours his love for the land and humanity into every figure. Each figure's unique expression—pride, recklessness, loneliness, attachment, contempt, fear, boldness, tranquility, and expansiveness—is precisely and powerfully portrayed by him, allowing people to see through the surface of these historical figures to their boundless inner world and stormy spiritual life. When we see the painting of Zhu Yuanzhang and Xu Da playing chess, our hearts even tremble. The stern palace atmosphere, the cruel master-servant relationship, the subtle psychological struggle, the scorching imperial demeanor, and the struggling servant's heart, are all portrayed so subtly. Through this painting, we see the entire feudal autocratic society, with its strict hierarchy and the shadow of death approaching, and the special psychological world of China under the feudal patriarchal system's shadow. Using limited forms to convey infinite spirits, using limited bodies to showcase infinite intentions, this is great art. Only great art has an everlasting life.

　　中华自有风骨在
    刘再复
    １９８４年，当日本建立范曾美术馆的消息传来时，我尚未与范曾谋过面，但我深深地为之而振奋。在日本的土地上，仅为两个外国画家建立过美术馆。一个是屹立在箱根的毕加索美术馆；一个就是屹立于冈山的范曾美术馆。而那时，范曾仅４５岁。我为我的同龄人而自豪。这一代知识分子，历经无数的颠蹶艰难，但仍然顽强地在大地上崛起，并且顽强地展示自己的非凡的才华与智慧。这种才华与智慧经过痛苦的心灵炼狱，一旦喷射，又显得那样辉煌，那样富有思想的征服力与艺术的征服力。
    当时，有位朋友告诉我，异邦的艺术眼睛已看清范曾的价值，而我们似乎还没有。我回答说，是的，审美确实需要距离，异域有了空间距离，它净化了世俗的偏见和审美眼睛中的杂质，看到画中的美与真诚。而我们，虽然没有空间距离，但还需要有段时间距离才能认识它的价值。我相信，距离愈远，我们将会愈加清楚地发现，这位出生于江苏省南通市、喜欢呐喊着“再造民魂”的中华之子，创造的是真正的中国画，在舒展柔润的宣纸上，凝聚的是千古难灭的中国风骨与中国艺术精神。这位拥抱祖国历史和祖国大地的画家，倾诉的是天长地久的对于故土的恋情，描绘的是任何痛苦命运难以击倒的中华之魂。正是这种不曾跪下的灵魂，肩托着我们民族的天空。
    我听过不少关于范曾的争议，但是，一切议论都无法从我的心灵中抹掉范曾艺术的魅力。这正是美的力量，令人难以拒绝的人类智慧对象化的力量。我在苦闷中多次地在范曾画前徘徊，我的精神从画中得到解脱与提升。蔑视鬼蜮的钟馗，行吟泽畔的屈子，临危慷慨的嵇康，面壁悟道的达摩，纵马江边的曹操，闭目凝思的一行和尚，全都心连广宇，满怀情思，而且全都肝胆照人并有一股超拔的清脱之气和凛然之气。
    我在这些历史人物画中，发现一种与我心灵产生共振的东西，这就是作为人的骄傲。不为平庸埋葬的轻狂，不为浊流所吞没的高洁，不为权势所屈服的人格，不为尘埃所染污的胸襟，还有造化赐予的英姿与禀赋，伟大母体中孕育出来的个性与天才，哪一点不是无价的资产呢？为什么要自我菲薄？为什么要扼杀人的内在的骄傲。范曾不能容忍这种扼杀，不能容忍人的自我贬抑与自我奴役。于是，他在自己的画笔中，灌注了对人的深情与信念，卓绝地展示人的风采与证明人的骄傲。范曾的画，所以力透纸背，情透纸背，说到底，就是人的自信心与自豪感穿透纸背。
    一个大艺术家，他的思想水平与艺术水平，不应当是国民的平均数。他理所当然应该高于这一平均数，并以自己的作品作为照明国民精神的灯火。因此，当许多心灵还在被奴隶思想、市侩思想所浸淫的时候，当许多惶惑的灵魂无所附丽的时候，艺术家就需要支撑起自己强大的脊梁，以天马行空的大超越力量磅礴于艺术，“诗思当如天岸马”，他当纵身大化而后又驰骋于艺术，此时，他的艺术才显示出强大的个性，显示出不同凡响的杰出性。范曾绘画艺术的成功，就在于他突破国民思想的平均数，绝不媚俗，而以独立的精神，开掘人类内心的骄傲，硬是步入前人未至的境界。我相信，在人类世界中，一切寻找丢掉了骄傲而陷入绝望的人们，将会从范曾的画中得到启迪。
    我所景仰的钱钟书先生曾对范曾的画作过很高的评价，他称赞范曾的画是“画品居上之上，化人现身外身。”当我知道这一评价的时候，我为之一震，并为范曾庆贺。这是多么难得的评价！钱钟书先生作为当代伟大的学者，从不轻许于人，他的赞誉，真是宝贵之极，中肯之极。
    范曾的人物画，确实堪称上上品。他在一首抒情诗中自述：“作画平生万万千，抽筋折骨也堪怜”。他从少年时代开始就常年伏案读书作画，２０多岁时，就因为过于辛苦而致使胸骨和脊椎骨变形，之后又数十年不倦地跋山涉水，既师古人，又师造化，在艰辛求索的路途中搏击沧浪，不断前行。他的画居“上之上”品，乃是他的多重磨难的果汁。他画每一个人物，都是借古人之英姿，以抒浩茫之心事，于是，他对笔下的人物倾诉了自己对土地、对人类的全部挚爱。每一个人物的特殊的神态——孤傲，轻狂，寂寞，依恋，鄙夷，恐惧，豪放，淡泊，旷达，都被他精确而气魄雄大地表现出来，使人们透过这些历史人物的表面，看到他们内在无边无际的心理世界和风激云涌的精神生活。当我们见到朱元璋与徐达对弈的画面时，我们的内心甚至跟着颤栗，严峻的宫廷气氛，残酷的君臣关系，微妙的心理搏斗，炙手可热的帝王神情与艰难挣扎的臣子心态，都表现得如此微妙。透过这幅画，我们看到画身之外的整个等级森严的、被死神逼近的封建专制社会，和那永远令人困惑的封建宗法制度阴影覆盖下的中国的特殊心理世界。以有限之形传递无限之神，以有限之身展示无限之意，这正是大艺术。唯大艺术，有长青不败的生命。
