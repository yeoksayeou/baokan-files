The trend of disliking learning is quietly spreading across China.

Who is to blame? Students are innocent; although a small number of teachers dislike teaching, the vast majority of teachers are working diligently and unnoticed. The root cause lies in the backward national psychology and flawed current policies.

Why say so?

Because China skipped the capitalist stage and directly entered the socialist society from a semi-feudal, semi-colonial society. Under the condition of extremely low productivity, we entered a socialist society that should have had developed industry. The backwardness of industry inevitably leads to not valuing knowledge and failing to see the value of knowledge, thus inevitably leading to the phenomenon of "body over mind." Without experiencing the capitalist society, we do not understand the importance of capital accumulation. Once someone, ignoring the national conditions, blindly advocates high consumption, it immediately resonates with the traditional national psychology. In the long-term feudal society, the small-scale farming economy passed down from generation to generation has instilled in agricultural producers a mentality of egalitarianism and mutual comparison. If someone gets rich first, others will feel psychologically unbalanced. Everyone wants to get rich together and spend money together, creating conditions for people to increasingly value money. In the current stage of China, the more people focus on money, the more they devalue the worth of knowledge. Why? Because traditional Chinese school education was for becoming an official. The single educational content and fixed educational methods have persisted to this day. All these historical, social, and psychological factors, when mixed together, will only devalue knowledge and make the trend of disliking learning more severe.

Specifically, analyzing the drawbacks of China's long-standing agricultural foundation, we can see that farmers have always relied on heaven and inherited experience for farming. Even today, in the 20th century, China's farming still uses primitive tools, plows with oxen, and hoes with people. Knowledge is unrelated to China's traditional agriculture. As early as the Han Dynasty, a farmer could support 2-3 people. This record has not been broken to this day. Isn't it 1 billion people and 800 million farmers? It should be known that in advanced countries, through knowledge, one agricultural worker can support 60-70 people.

China's agriculture does not need knowledge, then industry should rely on knowledge. Actually, it is not the case. The Chinese are good at invention but not good at utilizing the inventions. Chinese intellectuals lack the social environment and personal ability to transform knowledge into productive forces. For ordinary people, major inventions are too far from their daily lives. Everyone does not feel the benefits they bring to people, nor do they feel that they are the crystallization of knowledge. Everyone thinks that social wealth is created by workers and farmers, and intellectuals only move their mouths and pens, creating no wealth. Therefore, in today's China, knowledge is still not marketable.

Under such conditions, how can the value of Chinese intellectuals be realized? It is no wonder that there is the peculiar phenomenon of "surgical knives being less valuable than barber knives, and missile makers being less valuable than tea egg sellers."

The Party and the government have repeatedly tried to change the treatment of intellectuals, but can the national psychology accept it? As analyzed above, low productivity, production activities do not need new knowledge, and the current policy of introducing foreign knowledge results make the value of Chinese intellectuals not realized. The old tune that intellectuals are supported by workers and farmers is still being played. Therefore, in real life, there is the abnormal situation where the higher the educational level, the lower the living standard.

All of this, how can it not make students develop a dislike for learning?

Disliking learning is just a surface phenomenon. A deep analysis of its root causes can reveal many problems worth considering.

　　厌学风之我见
    厌学的出现只是一个表面现象
    它折射出许多值得思考的问题
    上海体育学院  潘兴
    厌学风，在中华大地悄悄地蔓延。
    谁之过？学生是无辜的；教师中虽有一小部分人厌教，但绝大部分教师在默默无闻中艰苦地工作着。究其风源，乃是出自落后的国民心理和失误的现行政策。
    为什么这样说？
    因为，我国是越过资本主义社会，直接由半封建半殖民地社会进入社会主义社会的。在生产力极其低下的情况下，跨入本该拥有发达工业的社会主义社会。工业的落后，必然导致不重视知识，看不到知识的价值，因而也就必然会出现体脑倒挂；而没有经过资本主义社会，就不懂得资本积累的重要性，因而一旦有人不顾国情，盲目提出高消费的主张，便与国民的传统心理一拍即合。在长期的封建社会中，代代相续的小农经济给农业生产者造就了平均主义、相互攀比的心理意识。假如有人先富一步，其它人都会心理不平衡。要富大家一起富，要花钱大家一起花，这就给人们越来越看重钱的心理意识创造了条件。在现阶段的中国，越向钱看，就越贬低知识的价值。为什么呢？因为中国传统的学校教育是为了做官，单一的教育内容，固定的教育方法，这股遗风一直延续至今。这种种历史的因素、社会的因素、心理的因素搅和在一起，只会使知识贬值，使厌学风愈演愈烈。
    具体地分析一下我国自古即以农立国的流弊，就会看到农民历来种田靠天，靠世袭经验。时至今日——２０世纪，我国种田还在使用原始农具，牛犁人锄。知识，与我国的传统农业是无缘的。早在汉朝，一个农民就能养活２—３人。这个纪录至今也没有被突破，不是１０亿人口８亿农民吗？须知在先进国家，靠知识，一个农业工人已可养活６０—７０人。
    我国的农业不需知识，那么工业应该要靠知识了。其实不然。中国人精于发明，却不善于利用发明出来的东西。中国的知识分子缺乏把知识转化为生产力的社会环境和自身能力。对普通百姓，重大发明在他们日常的生活中，距离太远了，大家体会不到它给人们带来的实惠，体会不出它是知识的结晶。大家都认为，社会财富是工人、农民创造出来的，知识分子只会动嘴动笔，创造不出财富。因此，在今天的中国，知识仍然是没有市场的。
    在这种条件下，中国知识分子的价值怎么体现出来呢？难怪会出现“手术刀不如剃头刀，造导弹的不如卖茶叶蛋的”奇特现象。
    党和政府多次想改变知识分子的待遇，但国民的心理能接受吗？上面已经分析，生产力低下，生产活动不需要新知识，现行的引进外国知识成果的政策，又使中国知识分子的价值体现不出来。知识分子是靠工人农民养活的这种老调仍有人重弹。因此，在现实生活中就出现了知识程度愈高、生活水平就愈低的反常状况。
    所有这一切，怎么能使学生不产生厌学情绪呢？
    厌学只是一个表面现象，深入地刮析它的深部，可以发现它折射出许许多多值得我们思考的问题。
