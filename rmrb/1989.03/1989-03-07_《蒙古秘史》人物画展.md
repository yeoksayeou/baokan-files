The Secret History of the Mongols is a work produced in the thirteenth century with very high academic value. It is the most important source for the study of Mongol literature, language, and military science, and is also the most important work for Mongolian studies experts from various countries to study Mongolian studies.

The Exhibition of Characters from the Secret History of the Mongols is a series of important historical figures from the era of Genghis Khan, meticulously studied, imagined, and created by Mongolian painter Siqin over many years. This exhibition forms a gallery of various distinctive figures from this historical period, reflecting Siqin's deep reverence and love for his nation's history.

Siqin graduated from the Art Department of the Inner Mongolia Normal University in the early 1960s. After graduation, he has consistently engaged in Chinese painting creation. Works such as "On the Battlefield" and "The Hunter" have participated in national art exhibitions. His works are characterized by a grand and unrestrained style, a harmonious spirit, and a free and easy use of brush and ink, pursuing both form and spirit. In recent years, the painter has often used Mongolian history as the theme for his creations. Last year, he completed the design drafts for multiple large-scale murals for the Genghis Khan Temple. This year, during the International Academic Symposium on the Secret History of the Mongols held in Hohhot, he also held an exhibition of characters from the Secret History of the Mongols, which has attracted the attention of experts both domestically and internationally. Recently, the painter has presented it to the broad audience in the capital. "Genghis Khan" is one of the exhibited works.

    《蒙古秘史》是一部产生于十三世纪，具有很高学术价值的蒙古族古代史。它是研究蒙古文学、语言、军事等科学的最主要源本，同时也是世界各国蒙古学专家研究蒙古学最主要的著作。
    《蒙古秘史》人物画展，是蒙古族画家思沁通过多年研习《蒙古秘史》，怀着对本民族历史的追思与热爱，揣摩、塑造了成吉思汗时代一系列重要历史人物，构成了这一历史时期各具风采的众多人物形象的画廊。
    作者思沁６０年代初毕业于内蒙古师范学院艺术系，毕业后一直坚持中国画创作，《演兵场上》、《猎人》等作品曾参加全国美展。他的作品，气势豪放，神韵贯通，笔墨洒脱。追求形神兼备。近年来画家多以蒙古族历史作为创作母题，去年完成了成吉思汗庙的多幅大型壁画设计稿，今年又在呼和浩特举行的《蒙古秘史》国际学术讨论会期间举办了《蒙古秘史》人物画展，已引起国内外专家们的注意，最近画家又把它奉献给首都的广大观众。《成吉思汗》是展出的作品之一。
