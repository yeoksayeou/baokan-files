Li Peng, in his government work report, discussed the Taiwan issue, expressing a willingness to consult with the Taiwan authorities and various sectors on national affairs.

He said, "We sincerely hope to consult with the Taiwan authorities and people from all walks of life on national affairs, and to engage in contact and consultations on the development of cross-strait exchanges and national reunification."

Li Peng hopes that the Taiwan authorities will abandon the unreasonable "three nos" policy as soon as possible, remove artificial obstacles, allow two-way, equal exchanges of people, and openly and directly engage in "three links" (direct mail, transport, and trade), as well as various exchanges in economics, culture, sports, science, and academia.

Li Peng said, "In recent years, the relationship across the Taiwan Strait has undergone significant changes. The long-term tense standoff and mutual isolation have shown initial signs of change, and economic, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people interactions across the strait have increased. This is the result of the joint efforts of compatriots on both sides."

Li Peng pointed out that the Taiwan authorities have taken some measures to ease cross-strait relations, but they still insist on the "three nos" and refuse to engage in talks. Recently, they have intensified their "flexible diplomacy," creating "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan," which is contrary to the fundamental interests and wishes of the compatriots on both sides of the strait. He emphasized, "We advocate 'peaceful reunification' and 'one country, two systems,' and firmly oppose any speech or action that may lead to Taiwan independence."

Li Peng hopes that the Taiwan authorities will abandon the unreasonable "three nos" policy as soon as possible and remove artificial obstacles. He also expressed a sincere welcome to Taiwanese businesspeople to invest and set up factories in the mainland, engage in various industries, and achieve mutual benefit and development of the national economy. He said, "We believe that with the joint efforts of compatriots on both sides, cross-strait relations will develop more deeply, and the great cause of national reunification will definitely be realized."

　　李鹏在政府工作报告中谈台湾问题        
    愿同台湾当局和各界共商国是
    坚决反对任何可能导致台湾独立的言论和行动
    台当局应尽早放弃“三不”政策发展两岸交流
    新华社北京３月２０日电　李鹏总理在政府工作报告中谈到台湾问题时表示，我们真诚希望同台湾当局和各界人士共商国是，就发展两岸交流和祖国统一问题进行接触和协商。
    他希望台湾当局尽早放弃不合情理的“三不”政策，消除人为的障碍，使两岸人员双向对等地往来，公开、直接地进行“三通”，开展两岸间经贸、文化、体育、科技和学术等各种交流。
    李鹏说，近年来，台湾海峡两岸关系发生了显著的变化。长期紧张对峙、相互隔绝的不正常状态已有初步改变，两岸经济文化交流和人员往来日益增多。这是两岸同胞共同努力的结果。
    李鹏指出，台湾当局为缓和两岸关系也采取了一些措施，但至今仍坚持“三不”和拒绝和谈的立场，最近又加紧推行“弹性外交”，制造“两个中国”和“一中一台”，这是同海峡两岸同胞的根本利益和愿望相违背的。他强调说，“我们主张‘和平统一’和‘一国两制’，坚决反对任何可能导致台湾独立的言论和行动。”
    李鹏希望台湾当局尽早放弃不合情理的“三不”政策，消除人为的障碍。他还表示热诚欢迎台湾企业界来大陆投资设厂，兴办各种实业，互利互惠，发展民族经济。他说，我们相信，在两岸同胞共同努力下，两岸关系必将更加深入地发展，祖国统一大业一定能够实现。
