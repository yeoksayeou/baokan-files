East Germany's private economy is an integral part of its socialist economy. Since its founding, East Germany has always allowed the existence of private economy, and in recent years, it has repeatedly emphasized the need to support and encourage the appropriate development of the private economy. Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the East German Party and Deputy Chairman of the Council of State, Mittaq, pointed out that in East Germany, the coexistence of various forms of ownership, excluding capitalist ownership, "best meets the requirements of the development of various productive forces and the needs of the people."

East Germany's private economy is mainly concentrated in handicrafts, retail, and catering industries. Currently, there are more than 80,000 private handicraft businesses nationwide, employing a total of 260,000 people. These can be divided into three categories: first, service industries such as bakeries, butcher shops, and shoemakers; second, vehicle maintenance and repair; third, construction industry. In addition, there are about 14,000 small retail shops and 11,000 private restaurants. Private restaurants account for about 40% of the total number of restaurants in the country.

Private business operators need to apply to local authorities for a business license to operate. Permissions to operate are conditional. First, the industry must genuinely meet local needs and be beneficial to the convenience of people's lives. Another condition is that the private business operator must have a certain level of technical proficiency and obtain a qualification certificate. If one has not yet obtained a technical qualification certificate but wishes to engage in private handicrafts, one can attend evening classes for further study, and after passing the exam, a certificate will be issued.

The state strictly regulates the prices and incomes of private businesses. The prices of goods and services of private businesses are regulated by the state, and they cannot set prices arbitrarily. Prices generally cannot be higher than those of state-owned enterprises. For example, small bread rolls are priced at five fenni each by the state, and private businesses can only sell them at five fenni each. For some goods that use more raw materials, prices can be slightly increased, but it must be clearly marked what additional raw materials were used. For some prices, such as repairs, a "negotiated" method can be used. However, it must be a genuine "negotiation," that is, discussing the price with the customer, rather than a so-called "negotiation" that is actually a high price with no customer input. The agreed price must be recorded, and it can only be lower, not higher. If there is a violation of price regulations, a fine will be imposed once discovered.

To prevent private businesses from earning too much, East Germany implements a progressive tax system. The chairman of the Berlin Handicrafts Association, Kohler, revealed their "tax secret" to the reporter: when the income of a private handicraft worker was 20,000 marks last year, 5,648 marks in taxes needed to be paid, accounting for 28.2% of the income; when the annual income was 50,000 marks, 23,370 marks in taxes needed to be paid, accounting for 46.7% of the income; when the annual income reached 60,000 marks, 30,000 marks in taxes needed to be paid, accounting for 50% of the income.

Despite this, private businesses still make a profit, and there are many who earn slightly more than other strata. Kohler said that most of the small villas in the suburbs of Berlin belong to private business operators, and some people even have two cars, but there are absolutely no millionaires.

### 民德管理个体经济有方

　　民德管理个体经济有方
    本报记者  许宏治 
    个体经济是民主德国社会主义经济的组成部分之一。民德自建国以来，一直允许个体经济存在，近年来还多次强调要支持和鼓励个体经济的适当发展。民德党中央政治局委员、国务委员会副主席米塔格指出，在民德，除资本主义所有制以外的各种所有制形式并存“最符合各种生产力发展的要求和人民群众的需要”。
    民德的个体经济主要集中于手工业、零售业和饮食业。目前，全国共有八万多家个体手工业户，从业人员共二十六万。它们可分为三类：一是服务性行业，如烤面包房、屠宰业、鞋匠等；二是车辆维修和保养业；三是建筑行业。此外，有一点四万家商业小零售店和一点一万家个体餐馆。个体餐馆约占全国餐馆总数的百分之四十。
    个体经营者需向地方当局申请领取营业许可证，方可开业。允许开业是有条件的。首先，所从事的行业必须确实符合当地的需要，有利于方便人民生活。另一个条件是，个体经营者必须具有一定的技术水平，取得合格证书。如尚未取得技术合格证书而又想从事个体手工业，可以进业余培训班进修，经考试合格后发给证书。
    国家对个体户定的价格和收入是有严格限制的。个体户的商品和服务价格由国家规定，自己不能随意定价，价格一般不得高于国营企业。如小面包，国家规定五芬尼一个，个体户也只能卖五芬尼一个。有些商品如多用了原料，价格可适当提高，但必须标明多用了什么原料。有些价格如修理，也可采用“议价”的办法。但必须是名副其实的“议”，即与顾客商量定价，而不是名为“议价”，实为高价，顾客并没有发言权。议定的价格必须记录在案，而且只能偏低，不能偏高。如有违反价格规定的，一经查出，要处以罚款。
    为防止个体户收入过高，民德实行征收累进税的办法。柏林市手工业协会主席科勒尔向记者透露了他们的“税收秘密”：当个体手工业者去年收入为二万马克时，需纳税五千六百四十八马克，占收入的百分之二十八点二；年收入五万马克时需纳税二万三千三百七十马克，占收入的百分之四十六点七；年收入达到六万马克时需纳税三万马克，占收入的百分之五十。
    尽管如此，个体户还是有利可图的，收入略高于其他阶层的大有人在。科勒尔说，柏林郊区的小别墅大部分是个体户的，有的人还有两辆汽车，但是绝没有百万富翁。
