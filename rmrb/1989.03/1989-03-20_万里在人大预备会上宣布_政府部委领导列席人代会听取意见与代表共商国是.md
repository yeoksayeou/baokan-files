Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 19th.

During the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, leaders from various ministries and commissions of the State Council will attend the plenary meetings of the various delegations to listen to the opinions of the representatives and answer their questions.

This news was announced by Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, at the preparatory meeting of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress.

It is understood that, in order to enable leaders from various ministries and commissions of the State Council to attend the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the State Council had made special arrangements, requiring these leaders not to leave during the NPC session to facilitate direct dialogue with the people's representatives and discuss national affairs together.

Wan Li also mentioned that during the NPC session, when the various delegations review the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law and the draft of the Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress, relevant officials will be present to listen to the opinions of the representatives.

He said that some improvements have been made to the procedures of this NPC session. First, it is planned to hold more plenary meetings of the delegations to allow representatives to speak in a larger scope; second, two days have been arranged for representatives to read documents, which will be beneficial for the representatives to review the proposals.

Wan Li also said that this NPC session will follow the practice of previous sessions, inviting leaders from the Communist Party of China who are not members of the Seventh National People's Congress, the Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and leaders from the central committees of various democratic parties to attend the opening and closing ceremonies; inviting members of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to attend the sessions; and inviting ambassadors from various countries stationed in China to attend a few plenary meetings. Journalists from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan regions, and foreign journalists will be allowed to cover the conference news.

　　万里在人大预备会上宣布
    政府部委领导列席人代会听取意见与代表共商国是
    新华社北京３月１９日电  七届全国人大二次会议期间，国务院各部、委有关负责同志将列席各代表团的全体会议，听取代表的意见，回答代表提出的询问。
    这一消息，是万里委员长在七届全国人大二次会议的预备会上宣布的。
    据了解，为了使国务院各部委负责人能够列席七届全国人大二次会议，国务院曾专门作了部署，要求各部委负责人在人代会期间不要外出，以便直接同人民代表进行对话，共商国是。
    万里还说，人代会期间，各代表团审议行政诉讼法草案、全国人大议事规则草案时，也安排了有关同志到会听取代表的意见。
    他说，对这次人代会的开法也作了一些改进。一是计划多开几次代表团的全体会议，便于代表在较大范围发言；二是安排了两天代表阅读文件的时间，以利于代表对议案的审议。
    万里还说，这次人代会还将参照以往的作法，邀请不是七届全国人大代表中的中共中央领导同志，中顾委主任、副主任，全国政协主席、副主席，各民主党派中央负责人，参加开幕式、闭幕式；邀请七届全国政协委员列席会议；邀请各国驻华使节旁听几次大会。香港、澳门、台湾地区的记者和外国记者，都可以采访大会新闻。
