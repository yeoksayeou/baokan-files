Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 13th.

The State Council's Port Office has informed that this year, the country will conduct comprehensive management of railway ports nationwide to alleviate car and station congestion and promote the smooth transportation of import and export goods.

It is understood that although port work achieved good results last year, the volume of import and export goods transported by railway ports decreased by 4.9% compared to the previous year, and the phenomenon of car and station congestion has increased.

This year, the State Council's Port Office will work with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, the Ministry of Railways, and the General Administration of Customs to revise and supplement the "Interim Measures for the Management of Imported Goods Transported by Land Ports," and formulate the "Management Measures for the Transport of Imported and Exported Goods by Railway Ports." The goal is to improve regulations and strengthen management. In addition to fully utilizing existing railway ports and river and road ports, new river and road ports will be opened as soon as possible to reduce the pressure on railways.

　　铁路口岸将综合治理
    缓解压车压站　疏通外贸运输
    本报北京３月１３日讯  记者陆振华从国务院口岸办获悉：国家今年将对全国铁路口岸进行综合治理，以缓解压车压站，促进进出口货物运输畅通。
    据了解，去年口岸工作虽然取得较好成绩，但铁路口岸进出口货物运量比上年度下降４．９％，压车压站现象有所增加。
    今年，国家将综合治理：国务院口岸办将会同经贸部、铁道部和海关总署，对《陆运口岸进口货物运输管理暂行办法》进行修改补充，制订《铁路口岸进出口货物运输管理办法》，完善法规制度，强化管理。除充分利用现有铁路口岸和河运、公路口岸外，早日开通一些新的河运、公路口岸，以减轻铁路压力。
