From November last year to the present, our police station has returned 18 minors who had run away from home and were wandering. The oldest was 14 years old, and the youngest was 11 years old. On January 5th of this year, two students from the second grade of Guzhuang Coal Mine Middle School in Shanxi Yangquan, Xiao Li and Xiao Zhou, fearing that they would not meet their parents' expectations in the final exams, discussed with 11 classmates about going to Hulunbuir League in Inner Mongolia to make money. Xiao Li and Xiao Zhou were to go first to scout the path. If the scouting was successful, they would write a letter to notify the other classmates to come. On February 4th, six students from a certain affiliated middle school of the Datong Coal Mine Bureau left home for 11 days, looking for a master with martial arts skills.

The reasons for these minors running away are as follows: First, some parents and schools have improper education for students, emphasizing high scores too much, making these minors unable to bear the pressure. Second, family breakups leave a shadow on the children's hearts. For example, a 15-year-old boy named Liu, unable to bear the coldness of his family, ran away from home and was sent back by the police three times, but he ran away again as soon as he was sent back. Third, parents spoil their children too much, and when the children's demands are not met, they run away in a fit of pique. Fourth, martial arts and erotic books make naive minors have unrealistic ideas.

These minors who run away from home generally do not consider the consequences, carry little money or belongings, and are helpless in a strange place, making it easy for them to be lured by bad people. Similarly, the running away of minors also brings pressure to society and families. Parents are anxious to find their children, either taking leave or mobilizing relatives and friends to search, spending all day running around. A parent in Ningwu County, Shanxi, spent 120,000 yuan to find a child who had run away.

The problem of minors running away from home is a social issue, and the whole society should pay attention to it and do its part to ensure the healthy growth of minors. At the same time, we would like to say to the minors: Parents' love is precious!

### 应关注少儿离家出走的问题

　　应关注少儿离家出走的问题
    去年１１月至今，我派出所送回１８名离家流浪的少年儿童，最大的１４岁，最小的１１岁。今年１月５日，山西阳泉市固庄煤矿中学初二学生小李、小周，因怕在期末考试达不到父母要求的成绩，便跟班里１１名同学商议，准备到内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟去挣钱，由他俩先外出探路。如探路成功，他俩再写信通知其他同学前去。２月４日，大同矿务局某子弟中学６名学生，离家外出１１天，寻找腿脚有功夫的师傅。
    这些少年出走的原因，一是少数家长和学校对学生教育不当，过分强调高分数，使这些少年难以承受。二是家庭破裂在孩子的心灵上留下阴影。如１５岁的刘某，因忍受不了家庭的冷遇而离家出走，先后被民警送回３次，但前脚送回后脚又跑了。三是家长对子女百依百顺，娇生惯养，孩子的要求一旦得不到满足，便赌气出走。四是武打、色情等书刊使涉世未深的少年想入非非。
    这些少年离家出走，一般不考虑后果，携带钱物不多，身在异乡孤立无援，极易被坏人引诱。同样，少年儿童的出走也给社会和家庭带来压力。家长们寻子心切，或请长假，或发动亲朋好友倾家而出，终日奔波。山西宁武县一家长为找出走的孩子，花费１．２万元。
    少年儿童出走是一个社会问题，全社会都应给予关注，为少年儿童的健康成长尽一份力。同时我们向少年儿童们进一言：可怜天下父母心！
