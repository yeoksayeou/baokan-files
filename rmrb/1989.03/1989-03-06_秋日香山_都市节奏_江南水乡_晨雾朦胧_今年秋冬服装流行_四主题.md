	Autumn in the Fragrant Hills, Urban Rhythm, Jiangnan Water Town, Morning Mist
	Four Themes for Autumn-Winter Fashion Trends

	BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- After several seasons of black and white dominating the fashion scene in China, a return to a variety of colors is expected this autumn and winter.

	This is according to the China Garment Research and Design Center, which today announced the trends for the 1989-90 autumn-winter season.

	Experts have identified four main themes for the season's colors: "Autumn in the Fragrant Hills," inspired by the red leaves of autumn in the Fragrant Hills; "Urban Rhythm," reflecting the stable and professional image of women in big cities; "Jiangnan Water Town," featuring low-saturation blues, greens, and purples; and "Morning Mist," capturing the modern Eastern feminine aesthetic.

	In terms of styles, women's fashion is shifting towards more feminine designs. Unisex styles will be replaced by typically feminine outfits that emphasize curves while maintaining a comfortable fit. The contrast in materials used for suits will also be more harmonious and soft. It is reported that on March 15, this trend will be showcased in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Taiyuan, Lanzhou, Dalian, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and Chengdu through model performances and trial sales.

　　秋日香山　都市节奏　江南水乡　晨雾朦胧
    今年秋冬服装流行“四主题”
    新华社北京３月５日电  （记者李安定）黑与白作为流行色，在中国时装业盛行几个季度后，将逐步为五颜六色的回归所取代。
    这是中国服装研究设计中心今天在８９—９０年秋冬服装流行趋势中公布的。
    专家们推出的今年秋冬服装流行色的四个主题：从深秋香山摇曳的红叶获得灵感的“秋日香山”，表现大中城市职业妇女形象稳重色的“都市节奏”，纯度偏低的蓝、绿、紫组成的“江南水乡”，有现代东方女性色彩的“晨雾朦胧”。
    在款式上，女装流行钟摆靠向女性化的一边，男女不分的款式将被注重曲线又不忽视适当松度的典型女装所取代。套装用料的对比也显得谐调柔和多了。据悉，３月１５日，将在北京、天津、上海、南京、太原、兰州、大连、广州、青岛、成都等大城市以模特表演和验证试销的方式展示这一流行趋势。
