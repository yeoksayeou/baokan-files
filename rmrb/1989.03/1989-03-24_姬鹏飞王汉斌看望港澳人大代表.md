Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 23rd.

Qi Pengfei, Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and Chairman of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and Wang Hanbin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Basic Law Drafting Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, visited Hong Kong and Macao representatives of the National People's Congress at the Beijing Hotel this afternoon. They listened to the representatives' opinions on the draft of the Hong Kong Basic Law.

Woo Kong Man, supervisor of the Hong Kong Po Chai Middle School, said that the consultation work on the Hong Kong Basic Law draft should not only be conducted in Hong Kong but also in mainland China. This is a great opportunity to promote the concept of "one country, two systems." Xu Shixiong, Chairman of the Hong Kong Scholars Association, hoped that all mainland members of the Basic Law Drafting Committee could visit Hong Kong to understand the situation there and exchange views with local residents. Representatives such as Liao Yuzhu, Zheng Yiaotang, Chen Heng, Wang Mingyuan, and Li Liangsheng also expressed their views on issues such as refugees in Hong Kong and specific provisions in the Basic Law draft.

Li Hou and Lu Ping, Deputy Directors of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, also exchanged views with the representatives.

　　姬鹏飞王汉斌看望港澳人大代表
    新华社北京３月２３日电  （记者王炽）国务院港澳办公室主任、香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会主任委员姬鹏飞，全国人大常委会副委员长、香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会副主任委员王汉斌，今天下午到北京饭店看望了港澳地区的全国人大代表，听取了他们对香港基本法草案的意见。
    香港培侨中学校监吴康民说，香港基本法草案的咨询工作，不仅在香港进行，而且也要在内地开展，这是宣传“一国两制”构想的大好机会。香港学者协会主席徐是雄希望基本法草委会的内地委员都能够去香港，了解那儿的情况，并与当地居民交流意见。廖瑶珠、郑耀棠、陈纮、汪明荃、李连生等代表，还就香港的难民问题、基本法草案具体条文规定发表了自己的看法。
    国务院港澳办公室副主任李后、鲁平也和代表们交换了意见。
