Yugoslavia continues to pursue responsible parties for the disturbances

Albanians clash with police again

	BEIJING, March 23 -- The Minister of the Interior of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo, Karakushi, accepted an interview with a reporter from the Kosovo "Regeneration" newspaper today. He said that 44 people involved in organizing or inciting the November and February incidents in Kosovo have been detained.

	In addition to the previously reported Kosovo Communist Alliance Provincial Committee member A. Vlasic and the 10 leaders of the "Trepcja" joint venture, those detained also include the director of the Kosovo Power Plant, R. Krasavac, the retired cadre and member of the Kosovo Communist Alliance Provincial Committee, E. Arifi, the leader of the Communist Alliance Provincial Committee's News Bureau, I. Osmani, and other leaders of social and labor organizations, as well as engineers.

	Minister Karakushi also pointed out that the Interior Department has evidence proving that many people in the political institutions and labor organizations of the Autonomous Province and regions of Kosovo participated in, organized, or played important roles in the aforementioned incidents. Some of these people still hold important positions in various organizations. They organized these incidents not only to oppose the implementation of the policies of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the amendments to the Serbian Republic's constitution but also to achieve personal goals.

	BEIJING, March 24 -- Yesterday, more than 10,000 Albanians (including many middle school students and women with children) in the city of Urosevac in the Autonomous Province of Kosovo took to the streets to protest against the amendment of the Serbian Constitution and demand the release of the detained A. Vlasic and others. They shouted slogans and threw bricks and stones at the buildings of the security organs and the police. The police retaliated with batons, and both sides clashed. After 9:30 PM, the entire city of Urosevac was under the control of the security organs.

　　南继续追究动乱责任者         
    阿族人再次与警察发生冲突
    本报贝尔格莱德３月２３日电  记者严正报道：今天科索沃自治省内务部长卡拉库希接受科索沃《再生报》记者采访时说，４４个参加组织或推动科索沃１１月事件和２月事件的人被拘留。
    这些人中，除了已报道过的科索沃共盟省委委员阿·弗拉西和“特雷普查”联合企业的１０名领导人外，还有科索沃电厂经理拉·克拉斯瓦契，科索沃共盟省委委员、退休干部埃·阿里菲，共盟省委新闻局领导伊·奥斯马尼以及其它社会组织、劳动组织的领导、工程师。
    卡拉库希部长还指出，内务部掌握的事实证明，科索沃自治省、区政治机构和劳动组织中的许多人都曾参与、组织上述事件，或在其中充当重要角色。某些人至今仍在各种组织中占据重要位置。他们组织这些事件除了反对执行南共盟政策和塞尔维亚共和国修改宪法外，有的还想以此实现个人的目的。
    本报贝尔格莱德３月２４日电　记者严正报道：昨天科索沃自治省的乌罗舍瓦茨１万多阿族人（其中许多是中学生和带孩子的妇女）上街游行，反对修改塞尔维亚宪法，要求释放被拘留的阿·弗拉西等人。他们高呼口号，并用砖头、石块袭击安全机构的建筑物和警察。警察用警棍进行反击，双方发生了冲突。晚上９时３０分之后，整个乌罗舍瓦茨的街道处于安全机构的控制之下。
