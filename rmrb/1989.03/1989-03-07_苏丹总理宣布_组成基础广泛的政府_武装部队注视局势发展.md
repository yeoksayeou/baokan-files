Sudanese Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi announced on March 5 that, with the support of the Sudanese armed forces, he will form a broad-based government and continue to serve as prime minister.

Mahdi made these remarks at a press conference following the signing of a national peace declaration by approximately 60 leaders of Sudanese political parties and unions on the evening of March 4. The declaration supports the peace agreement signed between the government and the southern rebel forces.

The second-largest ruling party in the Sudanese coalition government, the Democratic Unionist Party, withdrew from the coalition government in December last year after the government rejected the peace agreement it had signed with the rebel forces in November. On February 20, the Sudanese armed forces submitted a memorandum to Mahdi, demanding that he form a broad-based government to address the deteriorating domestic security, military, and economic situations. The memorandum also called for either an increase in military spending to support the army's fight against the southern rebel forces or the acceptance of the peace agreement signed by the Democratic Unionist Party with the rebel forces.

Mahdi told reporters that he would immediately begin consultations with relevant parties, and the new government would be announced as soon as possible. He also assured that the new government would strive for the broadest possible national unity.

Reports indicate that the Sudanese armed forces are currently on high alert, "monitoring" the development of the situation.

　　苏丹总理宣布
    组成基础广泛的政府
    武装部队注视局势发展
    新华社喀土穆３月５日电  苏丹总理萨迪克·迈赫迪５日宣布，由于苏丹武装部队的支持，他将组建一个基础广泛的政府，并在新政府中继续担任总理职务。
    迈赫迪是在同苏丹各政党和工会的大约６０位领导人于４日晚签署一项全国和平宣言之后的一次记者招待会上讲这番话的。这项宣言赞成同苏丹南部反政府武装签订的和约。
    苏丹联合政府第二大执政党统一民主党去年１１月同反政府武装签订的和约因遭政府拒绝而于去年１２月退出了联合政府。今年２月２０日，苏丹武装部队向迈赫迪递交了一份备忘录，要求他重新组成一个基础广泛的政府，以解决国内日益恶化的治安、军事和经济状况。备忘录还要求政府要么增加军费开支以支持军队同苏丹南部反政府武装作战，要么接受统一民主党同反政府武装签订的和约。
    迈赫迪对记者说，他将立即同有关各方进行磋商，新政府将尽快宣布组成。他还保证，新政府将致力于国内最广泛的团结。
    据报道，苏丹武装部队目前正处于戒备状态，“注视”局势的发展。
