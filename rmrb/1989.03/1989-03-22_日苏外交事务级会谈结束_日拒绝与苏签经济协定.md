Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 20th. (Reporter Yao Li) The 9th Japan-Soviet foreign affairs level talks concluded today in Tokyo. The Japanese side, adhering to the principle of "politics and economics are inseparable," rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to sign an economic cooperation agreement.

In the talks that began on the 19th, the two sides exchanged views on bilateral relations, as well as international issues such as U.S.-Soviet dialogue, normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, and the situation in Cambodia.

On the issue of bilateral relations, both sides agreed to strengthen dialogue in the future. The Soviet side proposed signing six cooperation agreements with Japan on economic cooperation, investment protection, environmental protection, tourism, and other aspects. However, the Japanese side reiterated the principle that without resolving the Northern Territories issue, economic cooperation between Japan and the Soviet Union cannot be expanded. They emphasized that there is still no political basis for signing an economic cooperation agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union, and thus rejected the Soviet side's request.

Starting from the 21st, Japanese and Soviet foreign affairs level officials will begin the first round of talks on the working group for signing a peace and friendship treaty.

　　日苏外交事务级会谈结束        
    日拒绝与苏签经济协定
    新华社东京３月２０日电  （记者姚力）第９次日苏外交事务级会谈今天在东京结束，日方以“政治经济不可分”为原则，拒绝了苏联方面提出的签订经济合作协定的要求。
    日苏双方在从１９日开始的会谈中，就双边关系问题以及美苏对话、中苏关系正常化、柬埔寨局势等国际问题交换了意见。
    在双边关系问题中，双方一致同意今后要加强对话。苏联方面提出与日本就经济合作、投资保护、环境保护、旅游等方面签订６项合作协定的要求。但日本方面重申北方领土问题不解决，日苏经济合作不能扩大的“政治经济不可分”的原则立场，强调日苏之间还不具备签订经济合作协定的政治基础，因此拒绝了苏联方面的要求。
    从２１日开始，日苏外交事务级官员将转入关于签订和平友好条约问题的工作小组的首次会谈。
