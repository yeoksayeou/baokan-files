The Italian Housewives' Association is a mass organization for housewives, and it currently has over 900 male members. Men who join the women's association have unique experiences.

Franco Bruno (male, 42 years old): "Every morning at 6:30, I get up. When my wife and son are getting dressed to go to school (my son is in elementary school, and my wife is a teacher), I heat up the milk and prepare breakfast. After they finish eating and leave, I start preparing lunch, airing out the bedding, sweeping the floor, using the vacuum cleaner, putting things to be washed in the washing machine, and tidying up the bed... until 11 o'clock, I have time to shave in the bathroom. Everything is so busy because I still have to go shopping. After shopping, I return home at 12:30. At 1:10, my son and wife come back from school, and they are hungry, so I serve them hot meals."

Carudio Castaldo (male, 47 years old): "I work in the electronics industry and have two children. I am an amateur househusband. I believe that household chores should be shared by both husband and wife, and whoever can do more should take on more. I spend more time at home, and my wife has a fixed job as a teacher. A few months ago, she passed her evaluation and became the principal of an elementary school."

Luigi Trassatti (male, nuclear physics professor): "I work on synchrotron accelerators. Four years ago, I joined the Housewives' Association and live in a countryside villa. I grow vegetables, cook, sew, iron clothes, clean, and repair things. I believe that men should discover the dignity and joy of household labor. Men and women can play equal roles. A man who can't wash dishes and a woman who can't tighten screws both make me annoyed."

Returning to the kitchen is not an easy task for men. Mr. Bruno became a "housewife" out of necessity. In 1980, his son Francesco was born, which raised the question of who would stay home to take care of the child. His wife had a fixed job, while he was only doing black-market work with low pay, so he had no choice but to stay home. At first, he felt uncomfortable being cooped up at home, and in Naples, a man doing what is considered women's work would immediately be looked down upon. Indeed, when his childhood friend saw him buying things on the street, he didn't even greet him and just walked away. In 1984, Mr. Bruno met the head of the city's Housewives' Association, Settimia Grieco, at a store where he was a salesperson. She told him many things and helped him realize that his workplace was at home, and he decided to fight for the recognition of the dignity of household labor. He joined the Housewives' Association, and people called him a "househusband," but he preferred to be called a "housewife" because when women engage in professions like judges and surgeons, their titles are the same as men's. Bruno's experience is quite representative among male members of the Italian Housewives' Association.

In Italy, men who join the Housewives' Association are more numerous in the south than in the north. Among them, some are unemployed with working wives, some are widowed or separated from their wives, and some join to take advantage of the conveniences offered by the Housewives' Association. However, most join to participate in the struggle for the status and rights of housewives.

　　妇女天地里的男士
    本报记者  罗晋标
    意大利家庭妇女协会是家庭妇女的群众性组织，目前已有９００多名男会员。男人加入妇女协会感受独特。
    佛兰科·布鲁诺（男，４２岁）：“早晨我６点半起床，当妻子和儿子穿衣服准备去学校（儿子上小学，妻子任教）时，我热牛奶，准备早点。他们吃完早点一出门，我即开始准备午餐，同时要让被褥透透气、刷洗地板、用吸尘器吸尘、把该洗的东西放进洗衣机、重新整理床铺……直至１１点，我才有时间到卫生间刮胡子。一切都是如此紧张，因为还要去采购。采购完，我１２点半回到家里。１点１０分我的儿子和妻子从学校回来，他们肚子饿了，我为他们把热腾腾的饭菜送上餐桌。”
    卡鲁迪奥·卡斯塔尔多（男，４７岁）：“我在电子工业部门工作，有两个小孩。算是个业余家庭男人，我认为，家务劳动应当由夫妻分担，谁能多做的还应多承担些。我在家里的时间多，我妻子有固定工作，是个教师，几个月前经过考核当上了小学校长”。
    鲁音亚诺·特拉萨蒂（男，核物理学教授）：“我从事同步加速器工作，４年前加入了家庭妇女协会，住在一所乡间别墅。我种菜、做饭、缝纫、熨衣服、洗刷、修理，什么家务活都会干。我认为重要的是男人应发现家务劳动的尊严和乐趣，男女可以起同等作用，不会洗盘子的男人和不会拧螺丝的女人，同样使我感到恼火。”
    男人返回厨房绝不是件轻松事。布鲁诺先生是出于家庭的需要而当“家庭妇女”的。１９８０年儿子弗兰切斯科出生，这就提出了夫妻中谁留家里照看孩子的问题。其妻有固定工作，而他自己当时只是从事黑市劳动，报酬又很低，因此别无选择，只能是他留家里。开始时他感到关在家里很别扭，而且在那不勒斯，一个男人从事被认为是女人的工作，马上就会被人瞧不起。果然当他的童年好友在街上看见他买东西时，连招呼也不打，就躲开了。１９８４年布鲁诺先生从一家商店售货员那里认识了市家庭妇女协会负责人塞蒂米亚·格里埃科，听她讲了许多道理，认识到自己的工作岗位就在家里，并决心为争取社会对家务劳动的尊严的承认而斗争。他加入了家庭妇女协会，人们称他为“家庭男子”，但他更喜欢叫他“家庭妇女”，因为当妇女从事法官和外科医生等职业时，跟男人的叫法是一样的。布鲁诺的经历在意大利家庭妇女协会的男会员中还很有点代表性呢。
    意大利加入家庭妇女协会的男人在南方比北方更多，他们中有的是妻子有工作的失业者，有的是鳏夫或与妻子分居的男人，有的是为了得到家庭妇女协会所给予的一些方便，但多数还是为了参加争取家庭妇女的地位和权利的斗争。
