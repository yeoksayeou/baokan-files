My wife and I returned to Guiyang from Hong Kong by plane on November 21st of last year. After arriving in Guangzhou, we went to the Guangzhou Civil Aviation ticket office to buy tickets. The ticket seller coldly said, “Where do you think I can find tickets for you!” We were in a hurry to return to Guiyang, so we asked the service staff at the Guiyang Municipal Small Car Repair Company's Guangzhou office hotel to help us buy plane tickets. The service staff was quite enthusiastic and quickly got us two tickets from Guangzhou to Guiyang, but each ticket cost 300 yuan. According to the official Civil Aviation price, a ticket from Guangzhou to Guiyang should be 87 yuan. With no other choice, we had to spend 600 yuan to buy the two high-priced tickets and return to Guiyang.

　　广州购机票不易　黑市价贵得惊人
    我和妻子去年十一月二十一日从香港乘飞机返回贵阳。到了广州后，我们前往广州民航售票处买票。售票员冰冷地说：“哪里给你找票去！”我们急着返回贵阳，托贵阳市小汽车维修公司驻穗办事处旅馆的服务员代购机票。服务员小姐倒是挺热心的，很快搞来两张广州至贵阳的飞机票，但每张票售价三百元。按民航牌价定，广州至贵阳的机票每张八十七元。无奈我们只好花了六百元，买了两张高价票返回贵阳。贵州贵阳市政府前二楼　汪宗正
