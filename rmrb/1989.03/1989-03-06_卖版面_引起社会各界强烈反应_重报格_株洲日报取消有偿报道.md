	Selling Space—Causes Strong Reactions from Society
	Revised Format—Stuzhou Daily Cancels Paid Reporting

	XINHUA, Changsha, March 5—Reporter Wu Xinghua reports: The *Stuzhou Daily* recently took the initiative to correct its practice of so-called paid reporting, which has been welcomed by enterprises, workers, and society at large.

	Due to the repeated increases in the price of newsprint, the *Stuzhou Daily* opened a section for so-called "advertisement literature" in order to alleviate its financial difficulties. This involved enterprises paying the newspaper to write reportage literature; the amount paid depended on the length of the reportage. Generally, publishing one piece of "advertisement literature" cost several thousand yuan. Workers in the enterprises reacted strongly, and various sectors of society looked on with concern, believing that this form of paid "advertisement literature" affected the objectivity of news reporting, damaged the newspaper's reputation, and increased the burden on enterprises.

	Recently, the *Stuzhou Daily* accepted readers' criticisms and decided that from now on, no department or individual within the newspaper could, in any form, write or publish paid "advertisement literature" articles. For "advertisement literature" that had already been paid for but not written, the newspaper would no longer write it. For "advertisement literature" that had already been written, it would no longer be published.

　　卖版面——引起社会各界强烈反应
    重报格——株洲日报取消有偿报道
    本报长沙３月５日电  记者吴兴华报道：株洲市《株洲日报》社最近主动纠正所谓有偿报道的做法，受到企业职工和社会的欢迎。
    由于新闻纸价格一涨再涨，《株洲日报》社为解经济上的燃眉之急，开辟所谓“广告文学”的有偿报道，就是企业出钱给报社，报社为该企业采写报告文学；出钱多少视报告文学篇幅长短而定；一般登一篇“广告文学”需数千元。对此，企业职工反应强烈，社会各界侧目而视，认为这种有偿“广告文学”，影响新闻报道的客观性，影响报纸的声誉，加重了企业的负担。
    最近，《株洲日报》接受读者的批评，决定今后报社任何部门和个人不得以任何形式采编、刊登有偿“广告文学”稿件；对已收款而未采写的“广告文学”，一律不再采写；已采写的“广告文学”，不再刊登。
