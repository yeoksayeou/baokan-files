The Vice Chairman of the Chinese Islamic Association and Chairman of the Xinjiang Islamic Association, Abudula Damaolai Aji, is a familiar religious leader to many. Because of his friendly and approachable demeanor, everyone affectionately calls him "Damaolai." He recently went abroad for a visit. On March 17, upon arriving in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, he heard that the 7th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference would open on March 19. He immediately decided to shorten his trip and boarded a plane in Guangzhou on the morning of March 18 to fly to Beijing.

On the evening of March 18, Damaolai arrived at the Xinjiang Liaison Office in Beijing for a brief stay before heading straight to his residence at the Friendship Hotel. By the time he arrived, it was already midnight. Peng Yao, the religious liaison who had just fallen asleep, was awakened to welcome him. Peng Yao was very happy because the eagerly awaited Damaolai had finally arrived, and the meetings of the religious group would be more lively.

　　大毛拉夜半赶到
    中国伊斯兰教协会副会长、新疆伊斯兰教协会会长阿不都拉·大毛拉·阿吉，是许多人熟悉的宗教界领袖。由于他为人亲善随和，人们都亲切地称他为“大毛拉”。前些日子他出国访问。３月１７日，他到达泰国首都曼谷时，听说全国政协七届二次会议将于３月１９日开幕，他即决定缩短行程，于３月１８日上午乘机经广州飞往北京。
    １８日傍晚，大毛拉到达新疆驻京办事处稍事停留，又马不停蹄直奔住地友谊宾馆。到时已是夜半时分。刚刚入睡的宗教组联系人彭耀被唤醒迎接他时，彭耀很高兴，因为大家盼着的大毛拉终于来了，宗教组的会议将更加活跃。　　（渡）
