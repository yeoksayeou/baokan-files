The country known as the "Thousand Islands," Indonesia, is rich in fertile land, abundant resources, and pleasant climate. Since the 1970s, relying on the large-scale export of oil and natural gas (which accounted for more than 70% of total exports), Indonesia achieved relatively rapid economic development (the average annual growth rate from 1974 to 1983 was over 7%), and was listed by the United Nations as a middle-income country. However, since 1982, due to the decline in oil prices, Indonesia's economy, which was overly dependent on oil exports, fell into difficulties. By 1985, the economic growth rate was only 1.9%. In 1986, the trade deficit increased by onefold compared to 1985, reaching $4.5 billion. Due to production shrinkage, unemployment became increasingly severe. In 1985, the number of people in unemployment and semi-unemployment status exceeded 25 million, with an unemployment rate of 20-30% or more, the highest in ASEAN. To get out of the trough, since 1986, the Suharto government has taken decisive measures to adjust Indonesia's economy.

Firstly, it adjusted the trade structure and increased the export of non-oil products. The main export items were timber, rubber, coffee, cement, fertilizers, and other agricultural and industrial products, and the shrimp farming industry was vigorously developed. In 1987, Indonesia's non-oil and natural gas export income was $9.054 billion, an increase of 34.5% over the previous year. It is estimated that the 1988 fiscal year can reach $11.3 billion, an increase of more than 25% over 1987, basically compensating for the losses caused by the reduction in oil export income.

Indonesia's processing and manufacturing industry was originally relatively weak, and with less foreign investment, it developed slowly. In the past two years, to arrange employment for the newly increased labor force and expand export earnings, reduce the trade deficit, Indonesia began to vigorously develop the processing and manufacturing industry, actively attract foreign investment with preferential conditions, and implement tariff exemptions to maintain the competitiveness of processing and manufacturing products in the international market. In 1988, Indonesia's processed product output value increased by 7.2% compared to 1987.

In addition, to reduce basic construction projects, the government comprehensively cut fiscal expenditures, with the president-approved construction projects reduced by 29%, department-approved construction projects reduced by 66%, national agency funds reduced by 64.3%, defense expenditures reduced by 7.9%, and education funds reduced by 10.9%.

At the same time, it increased import tariffs, set import quotas, restricted loans to import merchants, and controlled the amount of foreign loans. It encouraged private capital to invest in small and medium-sized enterprises, develop national industries, and open up employment opportunities. Domestic investment in the first 10 months of 1987 increased by 89% compared to the same period last year, and approved foreign investment in 1987 increased by 71%, reaching $1.49 billion.

Through the above efforts, Indonesia's economy is currently in a slow recovery process. The economic growth rate in 1988 reached 3.8%. The International Monetary Fund predicts that the 1989 target of 4.5% can be achieved. The budget deficit for the 1987-1988 fiscal year was reduced from $500 million last year to $260 million, and the inflation rate also dropped from 9% two years ago to 5%.

However, Indonesia's economy still faces severe challenges in its recovery process. Currently, Indonesia's foreign debt is $51.5 billion. According to the World Bank's estimate, by the end of 1989, it will reach $53.6 billion. The next two years are the peak years for Indonesia to repay principal and interest, with an estimated repayment amount of over $80 billion in 1989, accounting for 35% of foreign trade export income, far exceeding the 20% safety margin. Some insightful individuals believe that this will have adverse effects on Indonesia's future economic growth.

In addition, Indonesia has a large population, with 2 million young people entering the urban labor market each year, while the country can provide very few employment opportunities. These problems will always trouble the present and future of this "Thousand Islands" country.

　　“千岛之国”经济缓慢复苏
    孙国远
    有“千岛之国”之称的印度尼西亚，土地肥沃，资源丰富，气候宜人。７０年代以来，靠石油和天然气的大量出口（占全部出口额的７０％以上），印尼获得了较快的经济发展（１９７４—１９８３年年平均增长率达７％以上），被联合国列为中等收入的国家。但自１９８２年以后，由于石油价格下跌，使过分依赖石油出口的印尼经济陷入困境。到１９８５年，经济增长率只有１．９％。１９８６年的国际收支赤字比１９８５年增加了一倍，达４５亿美元。由于生产萎缩，失业问题日趋严重。１９８５年，处于失业和半失业状态人数已超过２５００万，失业率居东盟之首，达２０—３０％以上。为走出谷底，１９８６年以来，苏哈托政府果断采取措施，对印尼经济进行了一系列调整。
    首先，调整贸易结构，增加非石油产品出口。出口的项目以木材、橡胶、咖啡、水泥、化肥等农副和工业产品为主，并大力发展养虾业。１９８７年，印尼非石油和天然气出口收入９０．５４亿美元，比上年度增长３４．５％，预计１９８８年度可达１１３亿美元，比１９８７年度再增长２５％以上，基本上弥补了因石油出口收入减少带来的损失。
    印尼加工制造业基础原来就比较薄弱，加上外国投资少，发展比较缓慢。近两年来，为安排新增劳动力就业和扩大出口创汇、减少外贸逆差，印尼开始大力发展加工制造业，以优惠条件积极吸引外资，实行减免关税政策，以保持加工制造业产品在国际市场上的竞争能力。１９８８年，印尼加工制品产值比１９８７年增长了７．２％。
    此外，为压缩基本建设工程，政府全面削减财政开支，其中总统批准的建设项目削减２９％，各部委批准的建设项目削减６６％，国家机关经费削减６４．３％，国防开支削减７．９％，教育经费削减１０．９％。
    同时，提高进口关税、规定进口限额、限制向进口私商提供贷款，对外国贷款的数量也进行了控制。鼓励私人资本在中小企业投资，发展民族工业，开辟就业领域。国内投资１９８７年头１０个月比上年同期增长８９％，１９８７年批准的外资比上年增长７１％，达１４．９亿美元。
    通过上述努力，目前印尼经济正处于一个缓慢复苏的过程中。１９８８年的经济增长率达３．８％。国际货币基金组织预测，１９８９年可望实现４．５％的指标。１９８７—１９８８年度的预算赤字亦由上年度的５亿美元减为２．６亿美元，通货膨胀率也已由两年前的９％降至５％。
    但是，印尼经济在趋向复苏的进程中仍面临严峻的考验。目前印尼外债５１５亿美元，据世界银行估计，到１９８９年底，将达５３６亿美元，今明两年又是印尼还本付息最高的年份，估计１９８９年的还本付息额将达８０多亿美元，占外贸出口收入的３５％，大大超过２０％的安全系数，一些有识之士认为，这将对今后印尼的经济增长产生不利后果。
    此外，印尼人口过多，每年都要有２００万年轻人进入城市劳动市场，而国家能够提供就业的机会则很少。这些问题都会时时困扰这个千岛之国的现在和未来。
