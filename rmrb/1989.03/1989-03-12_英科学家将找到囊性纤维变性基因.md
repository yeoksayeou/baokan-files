British scientists may identify the cystic fibrosis gene

	Xinhua News Agency, London, March 10 — Professor Bob Williamson of the St. Mary's Hospital Medical School announced yesterday at the Cystic Fibrosis Research Conference that they may identify the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis within the next week or next year.

	Cystic fibrosis is the most common genetic lung disease. Experts believe that once the gene responsible for this condition is identified, it will be possible to isolate the protein it produces. Then, by altering the protein, cystic fibrosis can be treated.

	Professor Magdi Yacoub, an expert in organ transplantation, said at the conference that heart-lung transplantation is currently an effective method for treating this disease.

　　英科学家将找到囊性纤维变性基因
    新华社伦敦３月１０日电  英国圣玛莉医院医学院的鲍勃·威廉逊教授昨天在这里举行的囊性纤维变性研究会上宣布，他们可能在下周或明年，就能找出引起囊性纤维变性的基因。
    囊性纤维变性是一种最常见的肺部遗传病。专家认为一旦找出这种变性基因，就有可能分离出它的蛋白质，然后用改变蛋白质的方法即可治疗囊性纤维变性。
    器官移植专家马格迪·亚库布教授在会上说，心肺移植是目前治疗这种疾病的有效方法。
