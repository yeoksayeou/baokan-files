The vast Qinghai Province had a total industrial and agricultural output value of only 4.1 billion yuan last year, which is not comparable to the level of a single region or even a single county in the coastal provinces and cities. This is how National People's Congress delegate and Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, Tibetan cadre Yu Juecailang, introduced the situation to reporters.

“Some people say: ‘Implementing the readjustment, for economically developed regions, is like a cut on the tail of a cow; but for economically backward regions, it's like a cut on the head of a cow.’ Is this true?” Yu Juecailang said, “I do not agree with this statement, but it indeed reflects some actual situations in the western regions. The same policy can have different impacts in different regions. Qinghai has a weak foundation, poor infrastructure, and a late start, requiring more investment in resource development. However, with the current policy of compression, the impact on us is significant. Some resource development projects that were supposed to start have to be halted. Premier Li Peng pointed out in the government work report: ‘All local governments, departments, and units must consider the overall situation and firmly establish the concept that local interests should be subordinate to the overall interests.’ Qinghai Province must also serve the overall situation of national reform and construction, and the pace must be consistent.”

Yu Juecailang said, “Qinghai is vast with abundant resources, and over 4 million people of various ethnic groups are eager to contribute more to the modernization of our country. Currently, the national financial resources are tight, and it is not possible to invest more money in Qinghai. However, can we get more policies with high ‘gold content,’ or at least not reduce the preferential policies? The government work report states: ‘For the minority regions, there are indeed some special situations and problems in the readjustment, and corresponding policies and measures should be studied and adopted.’ Qinghai Province has over 40% of its population as ethnic minorities, and these policies and measures are like a timely rain for the people of Qinghai.”

Deputy leader of the Qinghai delegation and Governor Song Ruixiang discussed the external conditions for Qinghai's development from another perspective. He said, “Due to the relatively stable political and social environment in Qinghai in recent years, it has promoted the steady development of the economy. In 1988, the total industrial and agricultural output value increased by 14.1%; the grain output reached the best level in history. The per capita income of farmers and herdsmen increased by 25.67% compared to the previous year, and after deducting the factor of price increases, it still increased by 15.4%. Of course, due to Qinghai's weak foundation, these figures are not significant for the developed eastern coastal regions, but for Qinghai, one of the backward regions in the west, these achievements are not easy to come by.”

Song Ruixiang said, “Although Qinghai Province has a large Tibetan population, a wide distribution, and a geographical location adjacent to Tibet, the recent unrest caused by a few separatist elements in Lhasa has had an impact on Qinghai, but the scope is very small. The overall social situation in the six Tibetan autonomous prefectures (including one Mongolian-Tibetan autonomous prefecture) is relatively stable. A stable social and political environment provides favorable conditions for achieving readjustment, development, and stability.”

　　青海发展靠什么        
    宦爵才郎认为：一要步调一致二要给政策
    宋瑞祥说：首先要有稳定的社会政治环境
    于宁　王谨　庄严
    “偌大的青海省去年工农业总产值才４１亿多，不如沿海省、市一个地区甚至一个县的水平。”全国人大代表、青海省人大常委会主任、藏族干部宦爵才郎这样向记者介绍。
    “有人说：‘搞治理整顿，对于经济发达的地区来说，好比在牛尾巴上挨了一刀；而对于经济落后地区来说，好比砍到了牛头上。’是不是这样呢？”宦爵才郎说，这种说法我不敢苟同，但是它确实反映了西部地区的某些实际情况。同样一条政策，不同地区的感受不完全一样。青海省底子薄，基础差，起步迟，需要在资源开发上多投些资。但现在一搞压缩，对我们的影响就很大。一些要上的开发资源的项目，不得不停下来。李鹏总理在政府工作报告中指出：“一切地方、部门和单位，都要顾全大局，牢固树立局部利益服从全局利益的观念。”青海省也要服从全国改革和建设的大局，大步调必须一致。
    宦爵才郎说，青海地域辽阔，资源丰富，４００多万各族人民渴望对祖国的四化建设做出更大的贡献。目前国家财力紧张，不可能拿出更多的钱投入青海，但是能不能多给点“含金量”比较高的政策，或者不减少优惠政策呢？政府工作报告中说：“对于少数民族地区在治理整顿中确实存在的一些特殊情况和问题，要注意研究并采取相应的政策措施。”青海省少数民族占总人口的４０％以上，这类政策措施对青海人民来说，犹如旱天的甘露，非常需要。
    青海省代表团副团长、省长宋瑞祥则从另一个侧面谈到了青海发展的外部条件。他说：“我们青海省由于这些年政治和社会环境比较稳定，促进了经济的稳步发展。１９８８年工农业总产值增长１４．１％；粮食产量创历史最好水平。农牧民的人均收入比上年增长２５．６７％，扣除物价上涨因素，仍增长１５．４％，当然，由于青海的底子薄，这些数字对于东部沿海发达地区来说算不了什么，然而作为西部落后地区之一的青海来说，取得这些进步不易。”
    宋瑞祥说：“青海省虽然藏族人口较多，分布较广，地域位置与西藏接壤。但是这次西藏少数分裂主义分子在拉萨制造骚乱，虽对青海有影响，但波及面很小。全省六个藏族自治州（包括一个蒙古族藏族自治州），总的来看社会是比较稳定的。稳定的社会政治环境，为实现治理、调整、发展，提供了有利条件。”
