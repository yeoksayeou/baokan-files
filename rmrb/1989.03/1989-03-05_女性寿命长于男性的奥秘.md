Women have an average lifespan that is 8 years longer than men. This is due to three significant physiological advantages that women have over men.

Menstrual Advantage: In terms of blood loss, women are better adapted due to the long-term "training" from menstruation, while men have less tolerance. If healthy men and women lose the same amount of blood, men are more likely to die, whereas women have a chance of recovery with medical intervention.

Emotional Advantage: Long-term emotional suppression can lead to illness. Women are better at expressing their emotions compared to men.

Immune Advantage: Human immune regulatory genes are located on the X chromosome. Women have two X chromosomes, while men have only one, making women's immune genes stronger than men's.

Additionally, 70% of men are affected by smoking, while only 8.2% of women smoke. Therefore, adult men are more likely to die from lung cancer, emphysema, and respiratory diseases compared to women. Due to the influence of the Y chromosome in men's cells, men generally have a competitive and aggressive nature. In strength-based sports (including heavy physical labor), they often overexert themselves due to competitiveness. In daily life, their strong sense of competition often leads them to overestimate their abilities. At banquets, men are more willing to "risk their lives to accompany others." In front of the opposite sex, they often try to show their masculinity, ruggedness, and bravery, leading to overwork and long-term overloading. This can easily cause liver damage, kidney deficiency, and affect overall health, which is a significant factor in why men have a shorter lifespan compared to women.

　　女性寿命长于男性的奥秘
    调查表明，女性平均寿命比男性长８年，这是因为女性生理上比男性有着得天独厚的三大优势。
    月经优势：以失血而论，女性因为月经的长期“锻炼”而能适应，男性的耐受力就较差，如果健康的男女失去同样大量的血时，男性死亡，女性却有抢救康复的可能。
    情绪优势：长期的情绪压抑会导致疾病，而女性比男性更易发泄。
    免疫优势：人类免疫调节基因存在于Ｘ染色体中，女性有两条Ｘ染色体，男性只一条，故女子的免疫基因强于男子。
    此外，男子中有７０％的人受着吸烟影响，而女性吸烟者仅占８．２％，因此，死于肺癌、肺气肿及呼吸道疾病的成年男子明显地多于女性。由于男性身体细胞内Ｙ染色体的作用，使男性一般具有争强好胜的特点，在力量型运动（包括繁重的体力劳动）中往往会因争强而过度劳累，加之日常生活中好胜心切而自不量力。在酒宴上男人乐意“舍命陪君子”。在异性面前，为显示其男子的粗犷、英勇，而往往使身心操劳过度，长期超负荷的运行。易动肝火，气难平消，凡此种种，会损肝亏肾，影响健康，这是男子寿命低于女性的重要因素。
