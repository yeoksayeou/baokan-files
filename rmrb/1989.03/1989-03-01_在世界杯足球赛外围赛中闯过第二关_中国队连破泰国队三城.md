The Chinese national football team defeated Thailand 3-0 on the evening of February 28 at the National Stadium in Bangkok, securing their second victory in the qualifiers for the 14th World Cup.

All three goals were scored in the second half. China's number 8, Tang Yao Dong, and number 10, Ma Lin, scored two goals in the 9th and 18th minutes, respectively. Shortly before the end of the match, China's team passed the ball from the right side into Thailand's penalty area, and in the ensuing scramble, Ma Lin scored the third goal. However, for a considerable amount of time, China's team played sluggishly, unable to create many scoring opportunities. In the first half, most of their attacks were ineffective, except for number 7, Xie You Xin, who had one shot that hit the post. In the second half, China adjusted their lineup, with Ma Lin and Wu Qun replacing Liu Hai Guang and Xie You Xin, strengthening the midfield and forward positions, and playing more actively.

Thailand's team seemed affected by their recent loss to Iran, lacking both player effort and fan enthusiasm. Although they had a few good counterattack opportunities, they did not commit many attacking forces, and their center forward, Pi Ya Peng, was tightly marked and had little impact.

Currently, Group 5 has completed five matches. China has won both of their matches and has five goal differential. Iran also has four points and a four-goal differential. The competition for the qualifying spot in Group 5 is increasingly focused on these two teams. Thailand has one win and two losses in three matches, while Bangladesh has lost all three of their matches. Based on points and strength, these two teams have little hope left. China will travel to Dhaka on March 4 to face Bangladesh.

　　在世界杯足球赛外围赛中闯过第二关
    中国队连破泰国队三城
    本报讯  中国足球队２月２８日晚在曼谷国家体育场以３∶０挫败泰国队，取得第１４届世界杯外围赛第二战的胜利。
    三个进球都出现在下半时。中国队８号唐尧东和１０号马林在第９分钟和１８分钟时，先后踢进两球。比赛结束前不久，中国队从右路将球打入泰国队禁区，在一阵混战中马林打进第三个球。但是，在相当长的时间里，中国队打得粘粘乎乎，扯不出空当，在上半时大部分攻势里没有构成威胁，只有７号谢育新在一次正面攻击中射门打在立柱上。下半时中国队调整了阵容，马林和吴群立先后替下柳海光和谢育新，加强了中前场的跑动，踢得比较活跃。
    泰国队似乎受到几天前败给伊朗队的影响，不仅队员拚劲不足，连球迷也显得缺乏热情。尽管他们快速反击的质量不错，也出现了少数几次好机会，但进攻兵力投入得不多，中锋披耶蓬被牢牢盯住，没有什么作为。
    目前，第五小组已进行了五场比赛，中国队两战两胜，并有五个净胜球。伊朗队也积４分，净胜４球。第五小组出线权的争夺正一步一步集中在这两个队身上。泰国队三战一胜两负，孟加拉国队三战皆负，从积分和实力上看，这两个队都已没有多大希望。中国队将于３月４日作客达卡，与孟加拉国队交锋。
