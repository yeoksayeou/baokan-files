Recently, the Economic Research Institute of the Ministry of Commerce and the Wuhan Municipal Commerce Commission jointly held a "Seminar on the Stock System in Commercial Enterprises," focusing on the following issues.

The stock system differs strictly from partnerships, cooperatives, and joint-stock systems.

Referring to international conventions on the stock system and combining them with China's national conditions, the participants believed that the socialist commercial enterprise stock system should have the following characteristics:

1. Raising funds through public offerings, with the enterprise's total capital divided into equal shares, achieving a diversification of investment subjects on the basis of public ownership.
2. The stock system enterprise has legal person ownership, and shareholders have ultimate ownership—share rights. Once invested, shares cannot be withdrawn, but stock certificates can be freely transferred and traded.
3. Profits are distributed according to shares, and risks are shared.
4. Shareholders exercise indirect control over enterprise managers through shareholders' meetings and boards of directors.

Based on this, the participants pointed out that the stock system and partnerships, cooperatives, and joint-stock systems have strict distinctions and should not be confused.

A partnership enterprise is established through the agreement of contributors and a contract, and the rights of partners cannot be transferred without the consent of all partners. Partners are jointly and severally liable for the enterprise's debts.

A cooperative is a union of laborers, and participating in labor is a prerequisite for obtaining income. Members of a cooperative have the freedom to withdraw their shares.

A joint-stock system is a union of people that brings together capital, with fixed and clear shareholders. The transfer of stock certificates is restricted, but shares can be withdrawn.

Certain conditions are required to promote the stock system.

Most comrades believe that in the circulation sector, the stock system is suitable for large and medium-sized commercial enterprises with competitive advantages, as well as enterprise groups or alliances formed through horizontal integration. Policy-loss-making enterprises and monopolistic enterprises are not suitable for the stock system. Some comrades also proposed that the implementation of the stock system should be considered from two aspects: whether the conditions for implementing the stock system are met, including the degree of socialization of production, market development, credit system, and the enterprise's own quality; and whether the enterprise has a need, such as raising funds or reconfiguring production and operational elements. If both aspects are not met, the stock system should not be blindly implemented.

Intangible assets are particularly important for commercial enterprises and should be part of the state-owned stock capital.

Intangible assets are an important part of a commercial enterprise's property and should not be ignored because they are intangible. Especially for a few large and famous stores, the intangible assets represented by the "brand" are often the enterprise's great wealth. Factors such as location advantages and policy changes are the results of economic development, and the enterprise's reputation, credit, business routes, and service levels are the results of the enterprise's staff's long-term efforts. These should be evaluated and included as part of the state-owned stock capital.

There are three opinions on how to evaluate intangible assets at the meeting.

One opinion is that intangible assets are difficult to quantify, and it is best to find an amount acceptable to both the state and the enterprise through negotiation. Another view is that intangible assets should be evaluated through the market, that is, the price of the enterprise's stock.

Some comrades also proposed that within the scope of a city, intangible assets can be calculated through the difference in the capital profit rate of the enterprise and the average capital profit rate of the same industry in the commercial area, or through the difference in the capital profit rate of the enterprise and the average capital profit rate of the same industry in the entire city.

    怎样理解和试行商业企业股份制
    最近，商业部经济研究所和武汉市商委联合召开了“商业企业股份制理论研讨会”，着重谈了以下几个问题。
    股份制与合伙、合作、合股制有严格区别。
    参照股份制国际惯例，结合中国国情，与会者认为，社会主义商业企业股份制应当具有以下特征：（1）实行招股集资，企业全部资金划分为等额股份，在公有制基础上实现投资主体多元化。（2）股份制企业具有法人所有权，股东具有最终所有权——股权，一经入股便不能退股，但可以自由转让和买卖股票。（3）按股分红，共担风险。（4）持股者通过股东大会、董事会对企业经营者实行间接控制。据此，与会者针对我国目前有些商业企业试行股份制的做法强调指出，股份制和合伙、合作、合股制有严格区别，不能混为一谈。
    合伙企业是出资人合议并通过合同成立的，合伙人的权益非经全体合伙人的同意不得转让，合伙人对企业债务负连带无限责任；合作制是劳动者的联合，参加劳动是取得收入的前提条件，合作社成员有退股自由；合股制是人的联合带动资金的联合，股东固定而明确，股票的转让受到限制，但可以退股。
    推行股份制要有一定条件。
    多数同志认为，就流通领域来讲，股份制适用于具有竞争性的大中型商业企业以及通过横向联合组成的企业集团或联合体。政策性亏损企业、利益独占企业不宜实行股份制。也有的同志提出，实行股份制应从两个方面结合起来考虑，一是是否具备实行股份制的条件，包括生产社会化程度、市场发育状况、信用制度及企业
  自身素质等；二是企业是否有需要，如集资、生产经营要素重新组合等。不同时具备这两方面的条件的，不要盲目办股份制。
    无形资产对商业企业特别重要，应作为股金的一部分归国家所有
    无形资产对商业企业特别重要，是企业财产的重要组成部分，不能因为它看不见、摸不着而忽视它的存在。特别是少数大店、名店，以“招牌”为标志的无形资产常常是这些企业的巨大财富。位置优劣、政策变化等是经济发展形成的，企业信誉、声誉、商路、服务水平是企业职工多年努力的结果，应当加以评估，作为股金的一部分归国家所有。
    无形资产如何评估，会上有三种意见。
    一种意见认为，无形资产难以量化，最好通过国家和企业协商，找到一个双方都能接受的数额。另一种观点认为，无形资产要通过市场评估，即企业的股票价格。
    还有的同志提出，就一个城市范围讲，无形资产可以通过本企业的资金利润率同企业所在商业区同行业平均资金利润率的差率计算，也可用本企业的资金利润率同全市同行业平均资金利润率的差率来测定。
