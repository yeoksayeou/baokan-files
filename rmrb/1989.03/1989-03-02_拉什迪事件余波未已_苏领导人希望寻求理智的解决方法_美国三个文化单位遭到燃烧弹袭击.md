    The aftermath of the Rushdie incident lingers.
    Soviet leaders hope to seek a rational solution.
    Three U.S. cultural institutions attacked with Molotov cocktails.

    New York Times, Moscow, February 28 - The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Grjasimov, said today that the Soviet leadership is concerned about the situation caused by the book "The Satanic Verses."

    He said that a rational solution should be found to this problem. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze recently raised this issue during his visit to Tehran with Iranian leaders. It is reported that the Soviet Foreign Minister and Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati had nearly two hours of discussion on this matter. From the discussion, the Soviet side got the impression that the Iranian government is sincerely concerned about the resolution of the issue and believes that the Soviet Union can play a positive role.

    In commenting on the recent establishment of a government by the Afghan resistance, Grjasimov said that even Pakistan and the United States do not recognize this government. He emphasized that only under the condition that all political forces in Afghanistan participate, can a broad coalition government that guarantees Afghanistan's peace and stability be established.

    Our correspondent in Washington, February 28 - Two bookstores in Berkeley, California, and the office of a weekly newspaper in New York were attacked with Molotov cocktails today, the identities of the attackers are unknown. According to U.S. officials, these incidents may be related to Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses."

    President Bush said today that he cannot tolerate any attacks on freedom of speech and religious tolerance. The FBI has begun investigating the matter.

    The two bookstores in Berkeley have sold out all copies of "The Satanic Verses." The weekly newspaper in New York criticized the bookstores for not daring to publicly display the book last week.

    拉什迪事件余波未已
    苏领导人希望寻求理智的解决方法
    美国三个文化单位遭到燃烧弹袭击
    新华社莫斯科2月28日电  苏联外交部发言人格拉西莫夫今天说，苏联领导对《撒旦诗篇》一书所引起的一些情况感到不安。
    他说，应该寻找理智的解决办法解决这一问题。苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽最近在德黑兰访问时曾向伊朗领导人提出这个问题。据悉，苏联外长同伊朗外长韦拉亚提等为此进行了近两个小时的讨论。从讨论中苏方得到的印象是，伊朗政府真诚地关切事情能获得解决，并认为苏联可以起积极的作用。
    在评论最近阿富汗抵抗力量成立政府一事时，格拉西莫夫说，连巴基斯坦和美国也不承认这个政府。他强调，只有在阿富汗各派政治力量都参加的条件下，才有可能建成保障阿富汗和平与稳定的广泛的联合政府。
    本报华盛顿2月28日电  记者仓立德报道：加利福尼亚州伯克利的两家书店和纽约一家周报办事处今天遭到燃烧弹袭击，袭击者身分不明。据美国官员说，这几起事件可能与拉什迪的《撒旦诗篇》一书有关。
    布什总统今天表示，他不能容忍任何对言论自由和宗教宽容的攻击。美国联邦调查局已开始调查此事。
    伯克利的两家书店已售完所有《撒旦诗篇》存书。纽约那家周报上星期曾在社论中批评书店不敢公开陈列该书。
