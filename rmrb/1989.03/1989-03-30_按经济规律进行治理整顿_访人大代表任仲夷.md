Economic work must adhere to economic laws, especially the law of value. People can discover it, understand it, and leverage their subjective initiative to master and utilize it, making it serve the people's interests. However, it is impossible to change it or deviate from it based on one's subjective will.

Ren Zhongyi, who is 74 years old this year, formerly served as the First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee and is currently a member of the Central Advisory Commission. He told the reporter that since the central government proposed rectification and reform last year, various places have done a lot of work and achieved initial results. However, the issue of adhering to economic laws, especially the law of value, has rarely been discussed. This issue cannot be talked about only when it is deemed important and ignored when it is not. We cannot sometimes raise the pitch high and sometimes keep silent. Haven't we had enough lessons from being punished by objective laws?

At this point, the reporter asked: How should we view the relationship between administrative measures and economic measures in rectification and reform?

Ren Zhongyi believes that economic measures are the primary means to solve economic problems. In certain situations, adopting some administrative measures is completely necessary. Especially during the transition from the old to the new system, administrative measures cannot be abandoned too early. For example, regarding the price issue, some prices cannot yet be fully determined by the law of value and must rely on many administrative measures and economic measures with administrative characteristics (such as price controls and subsidies). These are only transitional measures out of necessity. However, it must be recognized that the fundamental solution to this problem is still to adopt economic measures. If administrative measures are relied upon for a long time, it will be difficult to fundamentally solve the problem. From the situation of rectification and reform over the past half year, many places have repeatedly used compulsory orders and coercive administrative measures to manage the economy, which should be highly regarded by leaders and departments at all levels.

Ren Zhongyi finally said, I agree with the implementation of "five-pronged approach" in rectification and reform, but no matter which method is used, we should strive to make the rectification and reform work conform to economic laws. Otherwise, we will not only achieve nothing, but also be punished by objective laws.

　　按经济规律进行治理整顿        
    ——访人大代表任仲夷
    本报记者  王行增
    “经济工作必须遵循经济规律，特别是价值规律要求。人们可以发现它，认识它，并可以发挥主观能动性，去掌握它，利用它，使之为人民利益服务；但绝不能根据人们的主观意志改变它，背离它。”任仲夷同记者一见面就抓住了这个话题。
    任仲夷今年已经７４岁了，曾任广东省委第一书记，现任中顾委委员。他对记者说，自去年中央提出治理整顿以后，各地做了大量工作，取得初步成效。但是，对于按经济规律，特别是按价值规律办事的问题却很少讲了。对于这个问题，不能认为它重要时就讲，认为不重要时就不讲。不能有时调子很高，有时闭口不谈。难道我们受客观规律惩罚的教训还少吗？
    说到这里，记者问：应该怎样看待治理整顿中采取行政手段和经济手段的关系呢？
    任仲夷认为，解决经济问题，经济手段是主要办法。在某种情况下，采取某些行政手段，是完全必要的。特别是在新旧体制转换时期，不能过早地放弃行政手段。比如物价问题，有些价格现在还不可能完全按价值规律办事，而必须采取许多行政措施和带有行政性的经济措施（如实行物价管制和价格补贴等），这只是不得已而为之的过渡手段。但必须认识到，解决这个问题，最根本的办法还是应当采取经济手段。如果长期依靠行政手段，是难以从根本上解决问题的。从这半年治理整顿情况看，不少地方一再发生用强迫命令、用强制性的行政手段去管理经济的情况，应该引起各级领导和部门的高度重视。
    任仲夷最后说，我同意治理整顿实行“五管齐下”，但不论运用哪种手段，都要尽可能使治理整顿工作符合经济规律。否则，我们不但一事无成，还将受到客观规律的惩罚。
