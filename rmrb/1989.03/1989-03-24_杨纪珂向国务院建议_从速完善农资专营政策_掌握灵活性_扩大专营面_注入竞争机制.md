People's Deputy Yang Jike said at the Anhui Province delegation's full meeting on March 22 that the monopoly policy for agricultural production materials has played a role, but problems have not been completely solved. He suggested that the State Council should expedite the improvement and supplementation of this policy; otherwise, the purpose of the monopoly will be difficult to achieve.

Yang Jike said that the main problems at present are: first, the shortage of fertilizers is difficult to fill, and the shortage of pesticides is even greater; second, such a heavy supply and marketing task makes the agricultural inputs and supply and marketing departments overloaded and difficult to sustain; third, due to transportation difficulties, seasonal agricultural inputs cannot be delivered to farmers in a timely manner; fourth, the supply and marketing departments and production enterprises lack funds, the supply and marketing departments are afraid of capital being frozen and are not proactive in increasing inventory, and production enterprises have the phenomenon of inventory backlog, forcing production enterprises to find their own way out; fifth, practices such as "writing notes" and "pulling strings" have not disappeared because of the monopoly.

Yang Jike believes that if the original monopoly policy is not supplemented and improved in a timely manner, the final result of the monopoly will be: coordination between industry and commerce will be difficult, the monopoly will not last long, there will be no way to solve the imbalance between supply and demand, and there will still be a breeding ground for improper practices. It is very likely to fall into the dead end of "monopoly leading to death."

When discussing how to supplement and improve the monopoly policy, Yang Jike said, he agrees with the opinions and suggestions of the Anhui Provincial Agricultural Adjustment Team. They believe that it is necessary to grasp the flexibility based on the monopoly, expand the monopoly units, and introduce a competitive mechanism. The rural science and technology network should join the monopoly team, especially the operation of pesticides, which is difficult to avoid mistakes without the participation of technical personnel; in villages with developed commodity economies, a good pre-production and post-production service system has been formed, and it should also join the monopoly team; the monopoly department can hire qualified special procurement agents from outside the system to enhance its operational capacity.

　　杨纪珂向国务院建议        
    从速完善农资专营政策        
    掌握灵活性　扩大专营面　注入竞争机制
    据新华社北京３月２３日电  （记者曹绍平）人大代表杨纪珂２２日在安徽省代表团全体会议上说，农业生产资料实行专营发挥了作用，但问题并未完全解决，建议国务院从速充实完善这项政策，否则专营目的难以实现。
    杨纪珂说，当前存在的主要问题一是化肥缺口难补，农药缺口更大；二是如此繁重的供销任务使农资和供销部门超负荷运行，难以为继；三是由于交通困难，季节性很强的农资不能及时送到农民手中；四是供销部门和生产企业资金严重不足，供销部门怕资金沉淀，不积极增加库存，生产部门出现压库现象，迫使生产企业自找出路；五是“批条子，走后门”等不正之风也没有因为专营而消失。
    杨纪珂认为，如果不及时充实完善原定的专营政策，专营的最终效果将是：工商之间协调艰难，专营难以持久，供需失调无术可解，不正之风仍有温床，很可能走入“专而死”的死胡同。
    谈到如何充实完善专营政策，杨纪珂说，我赞成安徽省农调队同志的意见和建议。他们认为，必须掌握专营基础上的灵活性，扩大专营单位，注入竞争机制。农村科技网络应加入专营队伍，尤其是农药的经营，离开科技人员，很难不出现失误；在商品经济发达的乡村已形成较好的产前产后服务体系，也应加入专营队伍；专营部门可以聘请系统外合格的特约采购员，以增强其运行能量。
