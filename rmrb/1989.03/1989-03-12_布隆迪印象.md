Burundi, located in central Africa, is known for its lush greenery and beautiful landscapes, earning it the nickname "Switzerland of Africa." However, I am more impressed by the people of Burundi.

		The Chinese Banana Grove
The Mujaere Hydroelectric Power Station, built by China in Burundi, has brought light to the nights of its capital, Bujumbura, and is praised as "a beacon by Lake Tanganyika." To express gratitude and friendship towards the Chinese engineers, the local county chief declared a banana grove planted by the Chinese engineers on a nearby hillside as the "Chinese Banana Grove," hoping that locals would not enter to pick the bananas. After the power station was completed and handed over in 1982, most of the Chinese engineers returned home, leaving only a few experts for technical cooperation. However, the lush "Chinese Banana Grove" remains, and the Burundians, with their sense of pride and self-respect, do not enter to pick the bananas. The Chinese working in Burundi still own a banana grove full of ripe fruits.

		Assistance More Precious Than Gold
"Burundian students who studied in China are all outstanding," said the Director of the Higher Education Department of the Burundian Ministry of Education, raising his thumb in approval. He recounted to me, "A graduate from the Huadong Water Conservancy Institute (now Nanjing Hydraulic Engineering University) is the head of the Mujaere Hydroelectric Power Station, while another is the director of the Ruvyironza Hydroelectric Power Station. A graduate from Tongji University is now a civil engineer in the Department of Public Works. The most famous is Deao..."

Deao is almost a household name in Burundi. He graduated from the Shanghai Institute of Textile Technology in the early 1980s and is now the technical manager of the Bujumbura Textile and Dyeing Joint Venture, the largest state-owned enterprise in Burundi. The workers of this enterprise say that Deao not only learned advanced textile technology from the Chinese but also adopted the excellent qualities of treating people equally and working hard. The general manager of the enterprise said, "This is assistance more precious than gold." The Burundian textile industry has been profitable for several years, with an annual profit of about 3 million US dollars, to which Deao has contributed significantly.

Deao is also famous for marrying a Shanghai girl. His wife opened a Shanghai restaurant in Bujumbura, allowing Burundians to enjoy the famous Chinese cuisine.

　　布隆迪印象
    明非
    非洲中部的布隆迪，山青水秀，景美如画，素有“非洲瑞士”的雅号，不过我更喜欢布隆迪的人。
    　　　　中国人的香蕉园
    中国为布隆迪援建的穆杰雷水电站，为其首都布琼布拉的黑夜带来了光明，被誉为“坦噶尼喀湖畔的一盏明灯”。为表达对中国兄弟的友谊和谢意，当地县长把中国工程人员在工地附近山坡上栽种的一片香蕉林宣布为“中国人的香蕉园”，希望当地人不要入内采摘香蕉。水电站于１９８２年竣工移交后，绝大部分中国工程人员回国了，只留下少数专家进行技术合作。然而，郁郁葱葱的“中国人的香蕉园”依然保留着，布隆迪人自尊自爱，谁也不入内采摘。在布隆迪工作的中国人至今还拥有一座果实累累的香蕉园。
    　　　　比黄金还宝贵的援助
    “从中国学成归来的布隆迪留学生都是好样的。”布隆迪教育部高教司司长竖起大拇指，如数家珍地对我诉说：“华东水利学院（今南京河海大学）毕业的留学生，一位是穆杰雷水电站的负责人，另一位担任卢维古拉水电站站长；同济大学毕业的一位，现为公共工程部的土建工程师；顶顶有名的要数德奥了……”
    德奥在布隆迪几乎尽人皆知。他８０年代初毕业于上海纺织工学院，现已担任布琼布拉纺织印染联合企业技术经理。这座布隆迪最大的国营企业的工人们说，德奥不仅向中国人学了到精湛的纺织技术，而且学到了平等待人和埋头苦干的优秀品质。该企业总经理说，这是“比黄金还宝贵的援助”，布纺织近几年每年盈利约合３００万美元，有德奥的贡献。
    德奥出名的另一个原因，是他与一位上海姑娘结为伉俪。他的妻子在布琼布拉开了一家上海餐馆，使布隆迪人能有机会品尝到有名的中国饭菜。
