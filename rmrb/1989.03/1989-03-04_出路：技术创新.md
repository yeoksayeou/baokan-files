	The Way Out: Technological Innovation
	By Chen Zujia, Reporter of the People's Daily

	Jia Yifeng, formerly a leader in a factory, later worked in the Policy Research Office of the State Economic Commission. After 1978, he served as Deputy Director of the Office of the State Science and Technology Commission, Deputy Director of the Planning Bureau, Director of the Key Projects Bureau, and Member of the State Science and Technology Commission. He is currently the Deputy Chairman of the Science and Technology Development Research Center of the State Science and Technology Commission. Over the past 10 years, he has been exploring the issue of integrating economics and science and technology.

	Reporter: I heard you are studying the issue of technological innovation. This concept is quite unfamiliar to the readers of our newspaper. Could you please introduce it?

	Jia Yifeng: The theoretical perspective of "technological innovation" was first proposed by the Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter in his 1912 book "The Theory of Economic Development." A key feature of innovation theory is the use of changes in production technology and methods to explain the economic development process. This is currently a hot topic internationally. Many developed countries have, at different times, formulated regulations and policies to promote technological innovation. Some developing countries have also explored a path to enhance the international competitiveness of their products through technological innovation, thereby revitalizing their economies.

	Reporter: However, Schumpeter himself believed that this theory is not suitable for socialist countries. So, what is the significance of studying technological innovation for our country's economy?

	Jia Yifeng: The theory of technological innovation has developed in recent years. People have combined technological innovation with the new technological revolution, hoping to enhance the international competitiveness of their national economies through the integration of economics and technology. This is a path to developing a commodity economy. This model is not only applicable to developed countries but also to developing countries with a certain economic foundation and scientific and technological strength.

	Looking at our country's situation, we have achieved good results in terms of economic growth rates. However, in terms of improving product quality, reducing consumption, and improving the efficiency of fund utilization and resource efficiency, the results are not ideal. The international community has long criticized us for having high per capita fixed assets, high input, and low output benefits.

	Reporter: Over the past 10 years, we have been promoting the integration of economics and science and technology, using scientific and technological progress to promote economic development. However, the potential of science and technology has not been fully realized. Some people attribute this to a lack of funds.

	Jia Yifeng: A lack of funds and insufficient per capita resources are only one aspect of the problem. The other aspect is how the existing funds are used and how the benefits of resources are realized. This is our main weakness. Internationally, there is an indicator for evaluating the economic development of countries called the comprehensive factor productivity (the difference between the total output and the input of labor and capital), and the contribution of comprehensive technological progress to economic growth derived from it. Since the founding of our country, our comprehensive factor productivity has been much lower than that of developed countries and is also at a relatively low level compared to some developing countries. There has been some progress since the 1980s, but it is still very low.

	We have previously focused mainly on quantitative growth, such as overtaking Britain and catching up with the United States, rather than on improving efficiency, quality, and reducing consumption. Although some documents also emphasize efficiency and effectiveness, in actual operation, from economic life to economic system and policies, there has been no effective guidance towards this. This is something we should reflect on.

	Reporter: So, what do you think is the way out for our country's economic development?

	Jia Yifeng: The way out lies in implementing a development model with technological innovation as its internal mechanism. In the past, when we talked about technological progress, we often focused on making good inventions and making our technology internationally leading. This is naturally necessary. However, does having good technological achievements mean having good benefits and efficiency? In fact, there is both a connection and a distinction between the two. The scientific and technological community, the economic community, and the business community have done very little research on this issue, as if it is not within their scope.

	Reporter: We have been promoting the application and promotion of scientific and technological achievements for at least 10 years. However, it has not been successful. There are reports that in Shanghai's machinery and electrical systems alone, 1,164 achievements were obtained from 1986 to 1987, but only 110 were promoted and applied, less than 10%. Even among the applied projects, there are very few products that have truly occupied the market and achieved significant benefits. It seems that there is still some mystery between achievements and commodities that has not been solved.

	Jia Yifeng: This is the technological innovation issue that we are currently studying. If we look at the research and development funds and the technological achievements obtained, Japan is not as good as the United States. However, Japan has the ability to turn achievements into products, surpassing the United States. In many fields, Japan's products are leading the world. This is because Japan, after the war, established a powerful technological innovation mechanism and implemented a set of effective technological innovation policies. South Korea's color TVs and cars being able to enter the U.S. market is a major reason for their successful technological innovation.

	Reporter: I understand your meaning. The technological innovation you are talking about refers to the process from technological achievements to production of products.

	Jia Yifeng: This is a creative labor process. There are several misunderstandings about technological innovation. Previously, it was translated as technological renovation. In Chinese, technological renovation refers to mass small improvements. In this way, technological innovation has not been given much attention. Another view is that technological innovation is the same as invention and creation, referring to technological achievements. This is not the case. Technological innovation is not only about acquiring technology and creating inventions, but more importantly, it is about creatively applying technology to production and manufacturing products to occupy the market. There is also a view that technological innovation is a matter of the technological field. This is also a misunderstanding. Technological innovation is an economic concept and should include economics, technology, management, and society, among other aspects, as a comprehensive work process. This is a strategic issue for improving a country's international economic competitiveness.

	Reporter: In that case, the connotation of technological innovation must be quite rich.

	Jia Yifeng: Technological innovation should include nine links: product design, production funds, supply sources of raw materials and equipment, production processes and technologies, new organizational management forms, new combinations of talents and training of workers, establishment of market sales networks, and the formation of an entrepreneurial class. These links are indispensable, and gradually improving these links and coordinating their relationships is a complex social system engineering.

	Reporter: These links are all weak in our country. Take product design, for example. From appearance to internal structure, the design is not very meticulous. Now there is a magazine called "Design," published by the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts. The business community pays little attention to it.

	Jia Yifeng: That's right. Through design, we can optimize the combination of relevant technologies and management and organizational experiences, giving the product new qualities and values. For this, we need to study commodity science, the market, and so on. Unfortunately, our current enterprises have capital investment in construction and production, but very little investment in technological innovation, including design, intermediate experiments, and product trials. For example, regarding sales, we have not treated it as a creative labor. Like the Wanbao product prepared for sale to the United States, the American agent sales company cooperating with Wanbao started sales preparations two years in advance, including advertising, and even established a special subsidiary for this purpose. South Korea has established sales networks in many countries around the world, and we started late in this regard.

	Reporter: The technological innovation you mentioned seems to be a process similar to the promotion and application of achievements.

	Jia Yifeng: On the surface, it seems so. However, these two concepts are based on different ideas and operating mechanisms. The promotion and application of achievements is a concept of a product economy, that is, achieving some application of achievements in certain aspects is the goal. If it can be made into a product, that would be the best result. As for whether it can become a commodity with international competitiveness, enter the market, and occupy the market, it is not within the scope of this concept. Technological innovation, on the other hand, is a concept of a commodity economy and a creative concept. To turn achievements into commodities, we need to study the functions and appearance of the product. For some consumer goods, we also need to include charm value, performance-price ratio, sales channels, advertising, after-sales service, information feedback, and so on. We not only need to study our own commodities but also study the strengths and weaknesses of our competitors, know ourselves and our enemies, and then we can be invincible. Therefore, to achieve technological innovation, we must first update our ideas.

	We talk about turning science and technology into productive forces. Here, there are two chains of different lengths. The long chain is from researching new concepts, through research, development, technological innovation to producing products; the other short chain is from technological achievements through technological innovation to products. At present, we need to develop the economy more like playing basketball, using the "cut-in" method from the middle, taking some existing technological achievements or introduced technologies as the starting point, and through technological innovation, producing high-quality new products. This is the latter path, that is, the shortcut of technological innovation, with a short cycle and quick results. This is a path to accelerate economic development for our country. This is also what international and domestic economic development experiences have repeatedly proven over the past few decades. I believe that establishing a powerful technological innovation system is the core issue of the entire system reform.

    出路：技术创新
    本报记者  陈祖甲
    贾蔚文，曾在工厂担负领导工作，以后到国家经委政策研究室。１９７８年后，任国家科委办公厅副主任、计划局副局长、攻关局局长、国家科委委员等职。现任国家科委科技促进发展研究中心副理事长。近１０年来，他一直在探索经济和科技结合的问题。
    记者：听说您正在研究技术创新问题。这个概念对本报的读者来说十分陌生。能否请您介绍一下？
    贾蔚文：“技术创新”的理论观点，最早由美籍奥地利学者熊彼特１９１２年在《经济发展理论》一书中提出来的。创新理论的一个重要特点是用生产技术和生产方法的变革来解释经济发展过程。这是当前国际上的一个热门课题。许多发达国家或先或后地制订了促进技术创新的法规和政策，有些发展中国家，也探索出一条通过技术创新提高产品的国际竞争力，从而使经济得到振兴的路子。
    记者：可是，熊彼特本人认为这种理论不适合于社会主义国家。那么，现在研究技术创新，对我国的经济有什么意义呢？
    贾蔚文：技术创新理论在近些年来有所发展。人们把技术创新与新技术革命结合起来，希望通过经济和技术一体化来提高本国经济的国际竞争力。这是一条发展商品经济的思路。这种模式不仅适用于发达国家，也适用于具有一定经济基础和科技力量的发展中国家。
    从我国的情况看，我们在赢得经济较高地增长速度方面取得了好成绩。但在相应地提高产品质量、降低消耗、提高资金利用效益和资源效率方面则不理想。国际社会对我们的人均固定资产高、投入高、产出效益低，一直有批评。
    记者：近１０年来，我们一直在鼓动经济和科技的结合，以科技进步来促进经济发展。可是科技的潜力始终没有发挥出来。有人认为这是资金不足的缘故。
    贾蔚文：资金缺乏，人均占有资源不足，这仅仅是事情的一个方面。另一方面，现有的资金运用得如何？资源的效益发挥得如何？这是我们最主要的弱点。国际上对各国经济发展的评价中有个指标，叫做综合要素生产平（指劳动力和资金的投入与总产值之间的差额），以及由此得来的综合技术进步对经济增长的贡献。我国建国以来的综合要素生产平不仅较发达国家低很多，同一些发展中国家相比较，也处于较低水平。进入８０年代以来有所进步，但仍然很低。
    我们过去把主要精力放在量的增长上，如超英赶美，而不把主要精力放在提高效益、提高质量、降低消耗上。尽管有些文件也提出讲究效益和效率，但实际运行中，从经济生活到经济体制、政策都没有向这方面进行有成效的引导。这是值得我们反思的。
    记者：那么，您看我国经济发展的出路何在？
    贾蔚文：出路在于实行以技术创新为内在机制的发展模式。过去我们讲技术进步，往往把主要视线放在搞出好的发明、使我们的技术在国际领先上。这自然是必要的。然而，有了好的技术成果是不是就有好的效益和效率了呢？实际上这两者之间既有联系，又有区别。对于这个问题，科技界、经济界、企业界都很少研究，似乎认为这不是自己范围的事。
    记者：我们鼓动科技成果的推广应用至少已有１０个年头了。可是，就是推不开。有资料说，仅上海市机电系统，１９８６年至１９８７年获得的成果达１１６４项，推广应用的只有１１０项，不到１０％。即便是应用的项目，真正占领市场取得重大效益的产品又寥寥无几。看来，从成果到商品，这里头还有什么奥秘没有解开。
    贾蔚文：这就是我们正在研究的技术创新问题。如果从研究开发的经费、所取得的技术成果来看，日本不如美国。但是，把成果变成产品的本领，日本却超过了美国。许多领域的产品，日本在世界上是领先的。因为日本在战后建立了一种强有力的技术创新机制和实施一套行之有效的技术创新政策。南朝鲜的彩电、汽车能够打入美国市场，技术创新搞得好是一个主要的原因。
    记者：我明白您的意思了。您所说的技术创新就是指从技术成果到生产产品的过程。
    贾蔚文：这是一个创造性的劳动过程。现在对技术创新有几种误解。以前曾把技术创新翻译成技术革新。而在汉语里，技术革新又是指群众性的小改小革。这样，技术创新就没有被引起重视。另一种观点认为，技术创新就是创造发明，是指技术成果而言。其实不然，技术创新不仅是技术的获取，创造发明，更主要的阶段在于把技术创造性地应用于生产，制造出产品去占领市场。还有一种看法，以为技术创新是技术领域的事。这也是一种误解。技术创新是一个经济概念，应当包括经济、技术、管理和社会等许多方面的一个综合性的工作过程。这是一个提高国家经济的国际竞争能力的经济发展战略问题。
    记者：如此说来，技术创新的内涵一定相当丰富了。
    贾蔚文：技术创新应当包括９个环节：产品的设计、生产资金、原材料和装备的供应来源、生产工艺和技术、新的组织管理形式、人才的新组合和对职工的培训、市场销售网络的建立，还有企业家阶层的形成。这些环节缺一不可，逐一地健全这些环节并且理顺它们之间的关系，是一个复杂的社会系统工程。
    记者：这些环节在我国都很薄弱。拿产品设计来说，从外观到内部结构的设计都不很讲究。现在有一本《设计》杂志，是中央工艺美院办的。企业界很少注意。
    贾蔚文：是这样。通过设计，可以把有关的技术和管理、组织的好经验优化组合进来，使产品具有新的品质和价值。为此，我们需要研究商品学、市场等等。可惜，我们现在的企业有基建投入，生产投入，却很少有技术创新其中包括设计、中间试验和产品试制等方面的投入。又比如，对于销售，我们也没有把它当作一种创造性劳动。像万宝产品准备销往美国，同万宝合作的美国代理销售公司提前两年就做销售准备，包括做广告，还为此专门成立了一个分公司。南朝鲜在世界上许多国家建立了销售网络，我们这方面起步较晚。
    记者：您讲的技术创新同成果推广应用好像是一个过程。
    贾蔚文：从表面上看是这样。然而，这两个概念根基于两种不同的观念和运行机制。成果推广应用是个产品经济的概念，就是说，把成果在某些方面得到一些应用就达到目的了。如果能做成产品那就是最好的结果了，至于能不能成为有国际竞争力的商品，进入市场，占领市场，不是这个概念的“分内之事”。技术创新则是个商品经济的概念，是个创造性的概念。为了把成果变成商品，需要研究产品的功能、外观，对于有些消费品来说，还要包括魅力价值、性能价格比、销售渠道、广告、售后服务、信息反馈等等。不仅要研究自己的商品，还要研究竞争对手的优势和弱点，知己知彼，才能百战不殆。所以，要实现技术创新，首先要更新观念。
    我们讲科学技术变为生产力，这里有两种长短不同的链条。长链条是从研究新概念，经过研究、开发、技术创新到出产品；另一条短链从技术成果经过技术创新到产品。在当前，我们发展经济，更需要像打篮球那样多采用从中间“切入”的方式，以有些已有的技术成果或引进的技术为起点，经过技术创新做出高质量的新产品，走后一条路，就是走技术创新的捷径，周期短，见效快。这对我国来说，是一条加快经济发展的道路。这也是近几十年国际和国内经济发展经验所一再证明了的。我以为，建立强有力的技术创新体制是整个体制改革的核心问题。
