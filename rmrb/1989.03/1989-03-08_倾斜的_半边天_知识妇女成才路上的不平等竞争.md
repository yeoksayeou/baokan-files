    The Tilted "Half of the Sky"
    — Unequal Competition in the Path to Success for Intellectual Women
    By Xinhua News Agency reporter Huang Wei

    “Life is about facing reality with a smile and overcoming obstacles to look towards the future.” This aphorism is greatly cherished by Xie Youyu, a female associate researcher at the Institute of Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and she is putting it into practice. However, what often puzzles her and other intellectual women is that the conditions for competition are not equal when overcoming obstacles.

    Women often get relegated to a “second tier”

    Xie Youyu, 51 this year, was the first female scientist to participate in China's Antarctic scientific expedition. She has short hair, a rosy face, a sturdy build, and speaks in a straightforward manner, clearly an efficient and decisive woman. Xie Youyu recalls an interesting story: Three years ago, at a meeting discussing the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" for the Antarctic expedition, a leader suggested that since Japan's Antarctic Showa Station had no women, China's Changcheng Station should not include any either. Xie Youyu, who was present, stood up indignantly and said, “This is a lack of trust in women.” However, when she finally went to the Antarctic and, like her male colleagues, braved the wind and snow to conduct field research, completing her scientific tasks successfully, some men commented, “Having a woman is inconvenient; we would have to build a separate women's restroom.” Xie Youyu couldn't understand why going to the Antarctic for research was any different from her years of fieldwork in China's mountains and rivers. During the return journey, some foreign friends asked her in surprise if she was part of the expedition team's “family.” Xie Youyu felt proud at that moment and replied loudly, “I went to the Antarctic to work.”

    Xie Youyu sighed, saying that usually, she only thinks of herself as a scientist and rarely considers her gender. However, the traditional concepts forged by China's thousands of years of feudal culture always place women in the second position. She hopes to start on the same line as her male colleagues!

    Women must bear more than men

    The saying “Women hold up half the sky” is well-known in China. However, women who bear both social responsibilities and the burden of human reproduction truly have to hold up half the sky, and they have to pay a great price for it.

    In the national key scientific research project—the Beijing Electron-Positron Collider—there is a group of female scientists. Among them is Mao Huishun, who has short hair and wears an outdated tweed jacket. If not for the glasses on her nose, people might mistake her for a simple village woman.

    Mao Huishun explains that it's not that she doesn't want to dress up more, but these years she simply hasn't had the time to attend to personal matters. She recalls the most difficult period: Five years ago, when the collider project was in its initial research phase, the experimental work was extremely intense, and the scientists worked nearly 10 hours a day, with female colleagues being no exception. At that time, Mao Huishun's husband was studying abroad, and she had to leave early and return late. Her son, who was in elementary school, had to wear a key around his neck to let himself in and heat up some leftovers for lunch. One day, Mao Huishun returned home late from work, pushed open the door, and saw her son, covered in mud, sleeping on the table. Next to him were his half-finished homework and an unfinished steamed bun. Mao Huishun hugged her son, and tears streamed down her face. It turned out that the child had fallen into a muddy pit on his way home from school that day… As both a mother and a wife, Mao Huishun was moved. She said, “For the same task, if a female colleague completes it, she has to make greater sacrifices. To become a successful scientist, it's hard; but to become a successful female scientist, it's hard times two.”

    Indeed, after struggling and striving, intellectual women have entered China's high cultural stratum. However, maintaining this position is not easy. According to a survey, currently in China's research institutions and universities, key positions and important research projects are mostly occupied by male colleagues, while many female students' academic performance in school is not inferior to that of male students. A significant reason for this is that after graduating, female colleagues, due to childbirth and household chores, fall behind in continuing education and self-improvement.

    Zhang Yiman, the female director of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, pointed out a noteworthy trend: the proportion of female scientists is declining. Zhang Yiman said that in her institute, among researchers under 60, there are 6 people, 2 of whom are women, accounting for 1/3; among associate researchers, there are 41 people, 11 of whom are women, accounting for 27%; among scientific and technical personnel under 45, there are only 2 women, accounting for 14%. Zhang Yiman joked, “We study ancient vertebrates, and dinosaurs, as ancient animals, are now extinct. Will female scientists in our research field also become extinct in the future?”

    It is understood that this situation is common in research institutions. Relevant personnel analyze that the reasons are: first, engaging in basic research has few ways to earn money, and the treatment of intellectuals is low, reducing the attractiveness of such research institutions; second, female scientists need to expend more energy to achieve a result compared to male colleagues, and many people give up when faced with difficulties; third, some units do not want to hire female colleagues when recruiting. Now, the difficulty of female university graduates finding jobs has become a social issue of public concern.

    Their Dilemma: Personal Weaknesses Are Also Obstacles

    Several female university students came to find Li Yunyan, the deputy general manager of the Science and Technology Company of the Chinese Academy of Sciences: “You are a female manager, so you won't discriminate against women, right?” Li Yunyan's response surprised them: “Although I am a female leader, I also don't want too many female colleagues in my unit.”

    Li Yunyan is frank and speaks her mind. She is the company manager and also the party secretary of the academy's management company, and she has to do ideological work, which involves dealing with people. However, what she fears the most are those female colleagues with narrow minds who cause trouble. Once, several female colleagues from the company came to Li Yunyan crying and making a fuss to seek justice, and she spent half a day understanding the situation, only to find that the cause was a trivial matter. Li Yunyan shook her head and said, “If this happens a few more times, how can we work?”

    There is another practical problem that troubles Li Yunyan. The company hired several young women with high cultural attainments, eloquence, and quick thinking as public relations personnel, and they indeed performed very well in their work. However, after a few years, the young women got married; then came pregnancy, childbirth, maternity leave; the child was young and often sick, so the mother had to take leave. During this period of nearly three or four years, female colleagues could not work with full concentration, and the expenses still had to be covered by the unit. Li Yunyan said that now, the more female colleagues a unit has, the greater the price it pays. The state should take measures to change this situation.

    Many intellectual women admit that due to long-term cultural influences, women, as a whole, have some differences in cultural quality compared to male colleagues. Therefore, as an intellectual woman, to become a strong individual in today's fiercely competitive society, one must establish a spirit of self-reliance, self-respect, self-sufficiency, and self-love, develop advantages, overcome weaknesses, and use practical actions to eliminate differences and strive for equal status.

    However, an undeniable reality still stands before us: Last year, a world-wide survey of six indicators ranked Chinese women's status at 132nd. Among China's cumulative 230 million illiterates, women account for 70% or more. This shows that improving the cultural quality of all women in China is an urgent and important task.

### 倾斜的“半边天”——知识妇女成才路上的不平等竞争

　　倾斜的“半边天”
    ——知识妇女成才路上的不平等竞争
    新华社记者  黄葳
    “生活，就是面对现实微笑，就是越过障碍注视将来。”中国科学院地理研究所女副研究员谢又予非常喜欢这段格言，并且正在身体力行。然而，时常令她和其他知识妇女感到困惑的是：在逾越障碍的过程中，竞争的条件却是不平等的。
    女性，常常被打入“另册”
    今年５１岁的谢又予是第一个参加我国南极科学考察的女科技工作者。她梳着短短的卓娅头，红扑扑的脸庞，结实的身板，说起话来十分干脆，一看就是个办事精明果断的女同志。
    谢又予说起一个颇有意思的故事：３年前，在讨论南极考察“七五”规划的会议上，有位领导同志提出，日本南极昭和站没有妇女，因而我国长城站也不打算让女同志参加考察。在场的谢又予气恼了，她“腾”地站起来说：“这是对妇女的不信任。”可是，当她终于去了南极，并像男同志一样冒着风雪在野外考察，圆满地完成了科研任务时，又有男同志说：“来个女同志多不方便，我们还得建个女厕所。”谢又予真不明白，去南极考察，同她多年在祖国的山山水水搞勘探，并无多大区别，怎么就有这么多不方便？返航途中，一些外国朋友惊奇地问她是不是考察队的“家属”？谢又予这时真感到自豪，她大声回答：“我是去南极工作的。”
    谢又予感慨地说，平时，我只知道自己是个科技工作者，很少想到“妇女”这个性别特征，但是中国几千年封建文化铸就的传统观念，却总把妇女排在第二位。我多么希望能和男同志站在同一条线上起跑呀！
    肩头非得比男性更能负重
    “妇女能顶半边天”的名言，在我国已是家喻户晓。但是，担负着社会职责和人类繁衍两副重担的妇女，真的要顶起半边天，却要付出极大的代价。
    在国家重点科研项目——北京正负电子对撞机的工程中，有一群女科技人员。她们中的毛慧顺，留着齐耳的短发，穿着过了时的咔叽外衣，若不是鼻梁上架了副眼镜，人们说不定会被认作是个朴实的山村妇女。
    毛慧顺解释说，不是不想把自己打扮得漂亮些，而是这些年来根本没有时间顾及个人的事情。她谈起了最困难的一段经历：５年前，电子对撞机工程处于研制的起步阶段，试验工作十分紧张，科技人员几乎每天工作１０多个小时，女同志也不例外。那时，毛慧顺的丈夫在国外学习，她又早出晚归，上小学的儿子只好在脖子上挂把钥匙，中午回来自己蒸点剩饭吃。有一天，毛慧顺加班回家晚了，推进门，只见混身沾泥的儿子正趴在桌上睡觉，旁边放着做了一半的作业和未吃完的馒头。毛慧顺抱起儿子，眼泪刷刷往下流。原来孩子中午放学不小心掉在泥坑里了……作为母亲和妻子的毛慧顺激动起来。她说：“同样一件事，要是女同志完成就得做出更大的奉献。要想成为一名有作为的科技人员，苦；可要想成为有作为的女科技人员，则是苦上加苦。”
    确实，知识妇女经过奋斗、搏击，进入了中国的高文化层次。可是，要维持住这一地位，并非易事。据调查，目前我国的科研机构、大专院校中，关键岗位和重要科研课题基本上由男同志占领，而不少女生在校时的学习成绩并不亚于男生。究其原因，其中很重要的一点是女同志走出校门后，由于生儿育女、家务活儿的拖累，在继续学习和提高上落伍了。
    中国科学院古脊椎动物与古人类研究所女所长张弥曼提出了一个值得注意的动向：女科技人员的比例在下降。张弥曼说，她所在的研究所里，６０岁以下的研究员有６人，女同志２人，占１／３；副研究员有４１人，女同志１１人，占２７％；４５岁以下的科技人员中，女同志仅有２人，占１４％。张弥曼开玩笑似地说：“我们是搞古脊椎动物研究的，恐龙作为古代动物，今天已经绝灭了。过了若干年后，我们研究领域中的女科技工作者是否也会绝灭呢？”
    据了解，这种情况在科研机构普遍存在，有关人士分析认为，其原因一是从事基础研究，挣钱的手段少，知识分子待遇低，减少了这类研究机构的吸引力；二是女科技人员要搞出一项成果，需要花费比男同志更多的精力，不少人知难而退；三是有些单位招人时就不想要女同志。现在，女大学生求职难已成为公众关注的社会问题。
    她们的尴尬：自身弱点也是障碍
    几位女大学生来找中国科学院科理公司副总经理李云言：“你是个女经理，想必不会歧视妇女吧。”李云言的回答却使她们吃惊：“尽管我是个女领导，可我也不希望本单位女同志过多。”
    李云言快人快语，说的是实情。李云言是公司经理，也是院管公司的党委书记，要抓思想工作就得和人打交道，但是她最怕的就是那些心胸狭窄、纠缠不清的女同志。一次，公司的几位女同志哭哭闹闹地来找李云言评理，她费了大半天时间了解情况，原来起因仅仅是一件微不足道的小事。李云言摇摇头说：“这样的事情多几回，我们还工作吗？”
    还有一个实际问题也使李云言头痛。公司招了一些文化修养较高、能言善辩、思维敏捷的姑娘作为公关人员，她们在工作中确实也干得十分出色。然而，过了几年，姑娘结婚了；随后是怀孕、生孩子、歇产假；孩子小，时常生病，妈妈就得请假。这期间将近三四年时间，女同志都不能专心地工作，所花的费用还得单位出。李云言说，现在是哪个单位女同志多，哪个单位付出的代价就大。国家应该采取措施来改变这种状况。
    不少知识妇女承认，由于长期的文化影响，在整体上造成了妇女的文化素质与男同志有一定的差异。因此，作为一名知识女性，要在当今社会激烈的竞争中成为强者，必须树立自强、自尊、自立、自爱的精神，发扬优势，克服弱点，用实际行动来铲除差异，争取平等的地位。
    但是，一个不可否认的现实还摆在人们面前：去年世界性学会综合６项指标统计，中国妇女的地位排在第１３２位。而我国累计达２．３亿的文盲中，妇女竟占７０％之多。由此可见，提高我国全体妇女的文化素质，更是一项迫在眉睫的重要任务。
