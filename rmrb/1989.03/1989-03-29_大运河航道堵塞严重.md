The Grand Canal waterway has been severely blocked recently. Last year, the waterway from Changzhou to Suzhou in Jiangsu Province experienced four major blockages, resulting in direct economic losses of over 3 million yuan.

Blockages in the Grand Canal often occur during the dry winter and spring seasons. From November 17 to 19 last year, the section from Wangmu to Qishuyan in Changzhou was blocked for three days due to shallow water and heavy traffic, causing the waterway to be impassable. From December 3 to 10, the section from Desheng Port to Weicun in Changzhou was blocked for 27 kilometers, stranding over 100 ship convoys, plus 96 ships stopped at Desheng Port, making the waterway congested and impassable. This year, from January 17 to 28, the section from Xushuguan to Xushuguan below in Suzhou had over 10,000 ships stopped, causing nearly half a month of waterway blockage.

Many shipping units have urged relevant departments to promptly renovate the Grand Canal waterway and effectively address the issue of waterway blockages.

　　大运河航道堵塞严重
    近来，大运河航道堵塞情况十分严重。去年，江苏境内常州至苏州的航道就发生了４次大堵塞，直接经济损失达３００多万元。
    大运河堵塞多发生在冬春枯水季节。去年１１月１７日至１９日，常州的王牧至戚墅堰段，因水浅船多，造成航道３天不能通航。１２月３日至１０日，常州的德胜港至魏村段堵塞长达２７公里，受阻船队１００多支，加上停在德胜港的９６只船，使航道挤得水泻不通。今年１月１７日至２８日，苏州许墅观上下１０公里处，停船多达１万多条，造成近半个月的航道堵塞。
    许多航运单位纷纷要求有关部门尽快改造大运河航道，切实解决好航道堵塞问题。
