Some places have artificially created barriers, exacerbating the supply-demand contradictions for pesticides. The reporter Chen Manzheng learned from the National Plant Protection Conference that since agricultural production materials have been put under specialized management, some places have adopted blocking measures for pesticide circulation: pesticides produced in the province are not allowed to be sold outside the province. This has blocked circulation channels and intensified the supply-demand tensions for pesticides.

The senior agronomist Zhang Qianghua from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry told the reporter that the province produces over 70,000 tons of pesticides annually, with 40,000 tons used within the province and the rest sold to other provinces and regions. This year, after the specialized management of agricultural resources, the plant protection departments are not allowed to sell pesticides. They had to return the pesticides to the factories, resulting in an accumulation of pesticides in the province and a 30% decrease in sales compared to the same period last year.

The blockade has also hindered the adjustment of surplus and deficit among pesticide varieties. Although Zhejiang Province produces various pesticides, it does not produce rat poison. The province's 15 million mu of farmland is severely affected by rats. Currently, it is the best time for field rat control without crops, and 1,500 tons of rat poison are urgently needed. However, after purchasing from various places, only 50 kilograms have been obtained so far.

Zhang Qianghua worriedly said that some village plant protection organizations in Zhejiang Province have had their business licenses revoked, and 20% to 30% of the grassroots plant protection organizations have shown signs of instability. If things continue this way, the plant protection network system may collapse.

### 一些地方人为设障  农药供需矛盾加剧

　　一些地方人为设障        
    农药供需矛盾加剧
    本报北京３月２６日讯  记者陈满正从全国植保会议上获悉，农业生产资料实行专营以后，一些地方对农药流通采取了封锁性措施：本省生产的农药不许出省。这样做，堵塞了流通渠道，加剧了农药供需紧张的矛盾。
    浙江省农林厅高级农艺师章强华告诉记者，该省每年生产农药７万多吨，本省自用４万吨，其余全部销售外省区。今年农资专营后，不准植保部门经营农药，他们只好向农药厂退货，造成该省农药积压，销售量比上年同期下降３０％。
    封锁还阻碍了农药品种间的余缺调剂。浙江省虽生产多种农药，但不产鼠药。全省１５００万亩农田鼠害严重，现在正值田间无禾灭鼠的最好时机，急需１５００吨鼠药，但四处采购，至今只弄到５０公斤。
    章强华担心说，浙江省已有部分村植保组织吊销了经营执照，２０％—３０％的基层植保组织已发生动摇，搞不好植保网络体系会解体。
