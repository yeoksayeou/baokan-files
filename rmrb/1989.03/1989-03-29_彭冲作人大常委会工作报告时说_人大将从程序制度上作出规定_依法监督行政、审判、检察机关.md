Peng Chong, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, reported to the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress today. He said that the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee will supervise the administrative, judicial, and procuratorial organs in accordance with the law. Summarizing the experiences of the past few years and considering the current situation, it is necessary to make some procedural and institutional regulations. These regulations include:

	— Reviewing and approving the reports on the national economic and social development plans and their implementation, as well as reviewing and approving the national budget and its implementation, are important aspects of the supervision of the government's work by the People's Congress. In the past, these reports were often distributed to the representatives just before the session. In the future, the draft reports should be sent to the representatives in advance. Once the plans and budgets are approved by the People's Congress, the government must follow them.

	— The Standing Committee, which meets every two months, can, as needed, listen to and deliberate on the work reports of the State Council and its ministries, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate. The relevant departments should seriously and responsibly respond to the questions and inquiries raised by the committee members.

	— Every year in the third quarter, the State Council should report to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the implementation of the plans and budgets.

	— When the People's Congress supervises the work of the courts and procuratorates, it does not directly handle specific cases. If there are opinions on the work of the courts and procuratorates, questions and inquiries can be raised. If the People's Congress has opinions on major cases handled by the courts and procuratorates, it can listen to the reports of the courts and procuratorates, or it can organize investigations in accordance with the law. If it is confirmed to be a wrong case, it can order the courts and procuratorates to correct or handle it in accordance with the law.

Peng Chong emphasized that the goals of the People's Congress and the administrative, judicial, and procuratorial organs are consistent. The People's Congress conducts legal supervision, which is both supportive and promotional of their work and a necessary constraint.

　　彭冲作人大常委会工作报告时说        
    人大将从程序制度上作出规定        
    依法监督行政、审判、检察机关
    新华社北京三月二十八日电  全国人大常委会副委员长兼秘书长彭冲今天在向七届全国人大二次会议作常委会工作报告时说，全国人民代表大会及其常务委员会对行政、审判、检察机关依法进行监督，总结几年来工作的经验，从目前实际情况出发，需要从程序上、制度上作出若干规定。这些规定包括：
    ——审查和批准国民经济和社会发展计划和计划执行情况的报告，审查和批准国家的预算和预算执行情况的报告，是人民代表大会对政府工作监督的重要内容。这些报告过去往往是临会发给代表，今后应提前把报告草案送交代表。计划和预算一经人民代表大会批准，政府必须遵照执行。
    ——每两个月一次的常委会会议，可以根据需要听取和审议国务院及其部委、最高人民法院、最高人民检察院的工作汇报。委员们提出的质询和询问，有关部门应认真负责地作出答复。
    ——每年第三季度，由国务院向人大常委会分别作关于计划、预算执行情况的报告。
    ——人大在监督法院和检察院工作时，不直接处理具体案件。如对法院、检察院的工作有意见，可以提出质询和询问。人大如果对法院、检察院处理的重大案件有意见，可以听取法院、检察院的汇报，也可以依法组织调查，如确属错案，可以责成法院、检察院依法纠正或处理。
    彭冲强调，人大和行政、审判、检察机关的总目标是一致的，人大依法进行监督，对它们的工作既是支持和促进，也是必要的制约。
