	Philippine newspapers in Manila have recently published articles calling on the Philippine government to cherish the friendship between the Philippines and China and opposing the passage of the "Mutual Benefit Relations with Taiwan Act."

	The *World News* published a commentary stating that since Corazon Aquino became president, relations between the Philippines and China have been friendly. In diplomacy, the Philippines acknowledges that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a province of China. China also does not oppose the Philippines conducting civilian trade with Taiwan.

	The newspaper said that the Taiwanese authorities, under the guise of protecting investments in the Philippines, are seeking to have the Philippine government pass the "Mutual Benefit Relations with Taiwan Act" to serve their "flexible diplomacy" policy and disrupt Philippine-China relations.

	The paper praised Philippine Foreign Minister Raul Manglapus for his foresight. It emphasized that if the bill is passed, it will affect friendly relations between the Philippines and China, and any deterioration in Philippine-China relations will not be beneficial to the Philippines.

	The *Philippine Daily Inquirer* also published an article opposing the "Mutual Benefit Relations with Taiwan Act." It pointed out: "If it is only to attract more Taiwanese investment, we can completely achieve this by simplifying investment procedures, eliminating bureaucracy, eradicating corruption, and improving the responsiveness of private enterprises," and there is no need to pass a special law.

	Meanwhile, the *Philippines Daily Globe* in its editorial called on people to learn from the experience of other ASEAN countries in handling relations with Taiwan. The editorial said that these countries maintain commercial relations with Taiwan without damaging their relations with the Chinese government.

　　菲律宾报纸纷纷发表文章
    反对《对台互惠关系法》
    新华社马尼拉３月１５日电  菲律宾马尼拉报纸近日来纷纷发表文章，呼吁菲律宾政府珍视菲中友谊，反对通过《对台互惠关系法》。
    《世界新闻》发表评论文章说，自科·阿基诺总统就职以来，菲中两国关系一直很友好。在外交上，菲律宾承认只有一个中国，台湾是中国的一个省。中国也不反对菲律宾和台湾进行民间的贸易往来。
    这家报纸说，台湾当局企图以保护在菲律宾的投资为名，要求菲律宾政府通过《对台互惠关系法》，以破坏菲中关系为他们的“灵活外交政策”服务。
    该报还称赞反对该法案的菲律宾外长劳尔·曼格拉普斯具有远见卓识。它强调，法案一旦通过，将影响菲中友好关系，而菲中关系的任何恶化对菲律宾都不会有好处。
    《菲律宾每日问询报》也发表文章反对《对台互惠关系法》。它指出：“如果仅仅是为了吸引更多台湾投资，我们完全可以采取简化投资程序，废除官僚主义，铲掉贪污腐化现象以及提高私有企业反应能力等措施来实现”，没有必要通过一个特殊法案。
    与此同时，菲律宾《环球日报》在社论中提请人们注意借鉴其他东盟国家处理对台关系的经验。社论说，它们和台湾保持商业关系，并没有损害与中国政府的关系。
