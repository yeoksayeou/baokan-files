The State Council's "Decision on Key Points of Current Industrial Policy" (hereinafter referred to as the "Decision") is published today. This is an important document for further implementing the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The various departments of the State Council and various regions should, in accordance with the requirements of the Decision, further reduce the scale of fixed asset investment, reasonably adjust the industrial structure, correctly guide the direction of foreign investment, and, in conjunction with financial and material capabilities, arrange the annual plan and the "Eighth Five-Year Plan."

Over the past half year, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, comrades from various localities and departments have worked together to achieve initial results in rectification and rectification. However, in terms of achieving the goals of rectification and rectification, there is still a long way to go, and a lot of hard work needs to be done. It is imperative not to relax and certainly not to give up halfway.

To further implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, we must not only continuously solve some practical problems but also focus on solving some issues of understanding and policy. If the key issues of understanding and policy are not correctly and clearly answered, if they are ambiguous and uncertain, it will hinder our work. The "Decision" precisely answers many questions that leading comrades or comrades engaged in economic work urgently need to be answered.

The Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee proposed some major policies and measures for rectifying the economic environment and economic order. One of the most important points is to reduce the scale of fixed asset investment in the whole society, adopt a tilted policy for key industries, reasonably adjust the investment structure, and truly control the scale of investment in the whole society. This is a principle that must be followed. As for what kind of tilted policy to adopt and how to adjust the industrial structure, detailed regulations are still needed. After several months of intensive investigation and research, the State Council has repeatedly sought the opinions of relevant departments and localities and finally formulated this "Decision," which makes relatively comprehensive regulations on the current industrial policy. The "Decision" clearly explains why this policy needs to be formulated, what the objectives and principles of this policy are, what the development sequence of various major industries is at present, and how various departments should ensure the implementation of this policy. The "Decision" is both comprehensive and specific.

For a period of time, people often talk about industrial policy. However, many comrades do not have a clear understanding of what our current industrial policy is. Through studying the "Decision," they can understand what industrial policy is and what kind of industrial policy we should implement at present. Some comrades have a relatively clear understanding of the industrial policy related to their own industry, but they are not clear about the overall picture of the industrial policy. In this way, they may hesitate and waver in execution, or only see the trees and not the forest. Through studying the "Decision," they can understand the overall picture of the industrial policy, deepen their understanding of the industrial policy related to their own industry, and thus more consciously and firmly implement the industrial policy.

For many years, the main problem in China's economic life has been that the total demand exceeds the total supply, and this gap is becoming increasingly large. This is the fundamental reason for the obvious inflation and excessive price increases that occurred last year. One of the important reasons for the total demand exceeding the total supply is the irrational industrial structure, mainly that the production capacity of the processing industry is too large, and the production capacity of the basic industries such as agriculture, energy, raw materials, and transportation is insufficient. Therefore, to ease the contradiction of total demand exceeding total supply and improve and increase effective supply, it is necessary to adjust the industrial structure while reducing total demand.

In implementing the industrial policy and adjusting the industrial structure, some industries and products need to be protected and supported, such as agriculture (especially the production of grain, cotton, oil, meat, sugar, and vegetables), suitable light textile products, infrastructure, and basic industries. Some industries and products, on the other hand, need to be restricted or even prohibited or stopped. Only by truly protecting what needs to be protected and truly restricting what needs to be restricted can the expected goals be achieved. To ensure the implementation of the industrial policy, it is necessary to advocate considering the overall situation and subordinating local interests to the overall interests. It is indeed painful to have to shrink or stop production of an industry that has been painstakingly established; it is also indeed regrettable to not earn money that could have been earned or to earn less money than could have been earned. However, for the overall interests, the national industrial policy must be firmly implemented. Slogans like "Revitalizing a certain province," "Revitalizing a certain city," "Revitalizing a certain county," and "Revitalizing a certain enterprise" are all good, but they should all be subordinate to the grand goal of "Revitalizing China." If there are aspects that harm the realization of this grand goal, they should be adjusted in accordance with the national industrial policy. Those who see the big picture are the true heroes.

To accelerate China's economic construction, we will continue to attract foreign capital, but the direction of foreign capital investment must also comply with China's industrial policy. To consider the interests of foreign investors, the "Decision" points out that joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises that have already been approved before the publication of this decision will continue to be implemented in accordance with the original contracts.

In implementing the industrial policy, ideological education is necessary, but more importantly, it is necessary to rely on economic, administrative, legal, and disciplinary means, with economic means being the main focus. A prominent feature of the "Decision" is its strong practicality. It explains in great detail the "guarantee policies and organizational implementation," clearly outlining the responsibilities and tasks of the planning, banking, taxation, and pricing departments. The relevant departments should, in accordance with the requirements of the industrial development sequence, and in conjunction with their own characteristics, quickly formulate specific guarantee policies and submit them to the State Council for approval and implementation. Localities should also actively support the above departments in performing their duties.

The "Decision" clearly states that the authority to formulate industrial policies lies with the State Council. Various departments and provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities with separate plans should formulate implementation measures based on the national industrial policy. If it is necessary to make certain supplementary regulations to the national industrial policy, they must be reported to the State Council for approval. Local and short-term interests should not be allowed to undermine the overall and long-term interests of the state. This is very important. The Constitution of China stipulates that the State Council has the power to "formulate administrative measures, enact administrative regulations, issue decisions and orders in accordance with the Constitution and laws," and has the power to "modify or annul inappropriate orders, directives, and regulations issued by various ministries and commissions," and "modify or annul inappropriate decisions and orders issued by local governments at various levels." This must not be forgotten by the responsible comrades of various localities and departments.

Formulating and implementing industrial policies will help to organically combine reform with development, planning with the market, better implement the overall policy of reform and opening up, ensure the smooth completion of the rectification and rectification tasks, and promote the long-term stable development of the national economy. In different periods of our party and government's leadership in economic construction, different industrial policies have been formulated. However, it is the first time that a complete set of industrial policies has been made public in such clear and explicit language. This reflects the improvement of our government's level of macroeconomic control and policy transparency. Of course, the current industrial policy still needs to be further enriched and improved in practice and amended accordingly with the changes in the economic situation. What people are now looking forward to is an increase in the degree of policy implementation, hoping that comrades from all localities and departments will work hard for the implementation of the national industrial policy.

### 认真学习和执行产业政策

　　认真学习和执行产业政策
    国务院制定的《关于当前产业政策要点的决定》（以下简称《决定》）今天公布了。这是进一步贯彻落实中国共产党十三届三中全会方针的一个重要文件。国务院各部门和各地区应当根据决定的要求，进一步压缩固定资产投资规模，合理调整产业结构，正确引导外资流向，并结合财力物力的可能，安排年度计划和“八五”计划。
    近半年来，在党中央、国务院领导下，各地方、各部门的同志共同努力，治理、整顿初见成效。但是对于实现治理、整顿所要达到的目标来说，还有很大的距离，还要做大量艰苦的工作，切切不可稍有懈怠，更不能半途而废。
    进一步贯彻落实十三届三中全会确定的方针，既要不断解决若干实际问题，更要着重解决某些认识问题、政策问题。如果对那些关键性的认识问题、政策问题没有正确、明晰的解答，若明若暗、捉摸不定，就会贻误我们的工作。《决定》正是回答了很多领导同志或从事经济工作的同志迫切需要回答的问题。
    十三届三中全会为治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序，提出了一些大的政策和措施，其中很重要的一条就是要压缩全社会的固定资产投资规模，对重点产业采取倾斜政策，合理调整投资结构，把全社会的投资规模真正管起来。这是原则性的规定，至于采取何种倾斜政策，如何调整产业结构，尚需作出明细的规定。国务院经过几个月的紧张调查研究，多次征求有关部门和地方的意见，终于制定出这个《决定》，对当前产业政策做了比较全面的规定。为什么要制定这项政策，制定这项政策的目标和原则是什么，当前各主要产业的发展序列是什么，各部门应当如何保证实施这项政策，《决定》中都说得既提纲挈领，又明确具体。
    一个时期以来，人们常常讲产业政策。可是当前我们的产业政策究竟是什么，很多同志心中无数。通过学习《决定》，他们就能了解什么叫产业政策，当前我们应当实行什么样的产业政策。也有些同志对于本行业有关的产业政策比较了解，但是对产业政策的全貌并不清楚，这样在执行中就可能犹豫不决，徘徊观望，或者只见树木不见森林。通过学习《决定》，他们就能了解产业政策的全貌，加深对本行业有关产业政策的理解，从而更自觉更坚定地执行产业政策。
    多年来，我国经济生活中的主要问题是总需求超过总供给的量愈来愈大。这是去年出现明显的通货膨胀和物价上涨幅度过大的根本原因。而造成总需求超过总供给的重要原因之一则是产业结构不合理，主要是加工产业生产能力过大，农业、能源、原材料和交通运输等基础产业生产能力不足。因此，要缓解总需求超过总供给的矛盾，改善和增加有效供给，就必须在压缩总需求的同时调整产业结构。
    执行产业政策，调整产业结构，有些产业和产品要保，要重点支持，例如农业（特别是粮、棉、油、肉、糖、菜的生产）、适销对路的轻纺产品、基础设施和基础工业等，有些产业和产品则要压，要限制生产以致禁止或停止生产。把该保的真正保上去，该压的真正压下来，才能达到预期的目标。为了使产业政策落实，必须提倡顾全大局，局部利益服从整体利益。自己辛辛苦苦办起来的产业，要把它压缩以致停产，确实有些心疼；本来能赚的钱不赚了，能多赚的钱少赚了，也的确有些可惜。但是，为了全局的利益，必须坚决贯彻执行国家的产业政策。“振兴某省”、“振兴某市”、“振兴某县”、“振兴某企业”的口号都很好，但是统统应服从于“振兴中华”的大目标。如果在某些方面有损于实现这个大目标，就应当以国家的产业政策为导向，坚决对这些方面予以调整。识大局者为俊杰。
    为了加速我国的经济建设，我们要继续吸收外国资金，但是外国资金的投向也要符合我国的产业政策。为了照顾外商的利益，《决定》指出本决定公布前已经批准合同的中外合资、合作企业和外商独资企业，仍按原定合同执行。
    执行产业政策，思想教育是必要的，更重要的是以经济的、行政的、法律的、纪律的手段为依托，其中又要以经济手段为主。《决定》的一个突出特点是实践性很强，它以很大篇幅说明“保障政策和组织实施”，对计划、银行、税务、物价等有关部门的职责和任务提出了明确的要求。有关部门应当根据产业发展序列的要求，结合各自的特点，尽快制定出具体的保障政策，报国务院批准后施行。各地也应当积极支持上述部门履行自己的职权。
    《决定》明确指出，产业政策的制定权在国务院。各部门和省、自治区、直辖市及计划单列省辖市，应根据国家产业政策拟定实施办法，若需对国家的产业政策作某些补充规定，须报国务院审批。不能因局部和短期利益而破坏国家的整体利益和长远利益。这一点是非常重要的。我国宪法规定，国务院有权“根据宪法和法律，规定行政措施，制定行政法规，发布决定和命令”，有权“改变或者撤销各部、各委员会发布的不适当的命令、指示和规章”，“改变或者撤销地方各级国家行政机关的不适当的决定和命令”。这一点各地和各部门的负责同志务必不要忘记。
    制定和实施产业政策，有利于把改革与发展、计划与市场有机地结合起来，更好地贯彻执行改革开放的总方针，保证治理整顿任务的顺利完成，促进国民经济长期稳定的发展。在我们党和政府领导经济建设的不同时期曾制定过不同的产业政策，但是把一整套产业政策这样以清楚明白的文字公之于众还是第一次。这反映了我们政府对宏观经济调控水平的提高，政策透明度的提高。当然，现在的产业政策在实践中还有待于进一步充实和完善，并随着经济情况的变化作相应的修订。人们现在期待的是政策实施度的增大，希望各地、各部门的同志都为国家产业政策的落实而努力。
