Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 28th.

Luogan, on behalf of the State Council, explained at the third plenary session of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress held this morning, the proposal submitted by Premier Li Peng for this Congress to consider, regarding the authorization of Shenzhen to formulate special regulations and rules for the Special Economic Zone.

Luogan said, in the ten years since the establishment of the Special Economic Zone, Shenzhen has made remarkable achievements, with reforms breaking through in many areas and the national economy experiencing rapid development. However, Shenzhen's further development also faces some new problems. The most prominent issue is the lack of a commodity economic order that is suitable for it. This is mainly reflected in the absence of a complete legal system that meets the needs of a commodity economy and conforms to international practices, as well as a new system that ensures the government operates with integrity and efficiency. This has become an obstacle to the further opening up and development of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.

He said, to solve the above problems, the State Council proposes, in accordance with the Constitution and the Organic Law of Local People's Congresses and Local People's Governments, to establish a People's Congress and its Standing Committee in Shenzhen, and to authorize the Shenzhen People's Congress and its Standing Committee to formulate special regulations for the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone according to the specific situation of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, in line with the basic principles of the Constitution, laws, and administrative regulations; to authorize the Shenzhen People's Government to exercise the corresponding administrative power, that is, to formulate special rules for the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone.

Luogan said, this proposal is based on the following reasons:

First, the experience of some late-developing newly industrialized countries abroad shows that to establish a legal system that meets the needs of a commodity economy in a short period of time, it is necessary to boldly draw on the economic regulations and management systems of some developed countries and regions. We need to learn from this successful experience, but this work is very complex and significant. For the sake of prudence, it is necessary to choose an appropriate region to conduct experiments, gain experience, and then promote it nationwide. The human, geographical, and economic conditions of Shenzhen determine that it is the most suitable place to conduct this experiment.

Second, as the earliest Special Economic Zone in China, Shenzhen is at the forefront of the country in terms of opening up to the outside world and reforming the economic system. The way the government manages the economy urgently needs to shift from mainly administrative measures to mainly legal measures. Therefore, it is necessary for the National People's Congress to grant the Shenzhen People's Congress and its Standing Committee the power to formulate regulations, on the premise that they do not conflict with the basic principles of the Constitution, laws, and administrative regulations, and to grant the Shenzhen People's Government the corresponding administrative power to formulate rules. The proposal also stipulates the system of filing with the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, and the Standing Committee of the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress.

　　罗干就李鹏总理所提议案作说明        
    授权深圳制定特区法规规章        
    建立相适应的商品经济秩序
    新华社北京３月２８日电  国务院秘书长罗干受国务院委托在今天上午举行的七届全国人大二次会议第三次大会上，就李鹏总理提请这次大会审议的关于授权深圳市人民代表大会及其常务委员会和深圳市人民政府分别制定深圳经济特区法规和深圳经济特区规章的议案作了说明。
    罗干说，深圳市在建立经济特区后的十年中已经取得了显著的成就，改革在许多方面有所突破，国民经济获得了高速发展。但是，深圳市的进一步发展也面临着一些新的问题。最突出的是没有建立起与之相适应的商品经济秩序。主要表现在缺乏完整的适应商品经济需要并符合国际惯例的法律体系和保证政府廉洁高效运转的新体制，这已经成为深圳经济特区进一步开放和发展的障碍。
    他说，为了解决上述问题，国务院建议，依照宪法、地方各级人民代表大会和地方各级人民政府组织法的规定，在深圳市设立人民代表大会及其常务委员会，并授权深圳市人民代表大会及其常务委员会，根据深圳经济特区的具体情况，遵循宪法、法律和行政法规的基本原则制定深圳经济特区法规；授权深圳市人民政府行使相应的行政权，即制定深圳经济特区规章。
    罗干说，此建议是基于以下理由：
    第一、国外一些后发展起来的新兴工业化国家的经验表明，要想在短时间内建立适应商品经济需要的法律体系，都要大胆地借鉴发达国家和地区的某些经济法规和管理体制。我们有必要吸取这一成功的经验，但这项工作十分复杂，关系重大，为稳妥起见，必须选择适当的地区进行试验，取得经验后再向全国推广。深圳市的人文地理经济情况决定了它是进行此项试验的最适当的地方。
    第二、深圳市作为我国最早的经济特区，在对外开放和经济体制改革方面走在全国的前列，政府管理经济的方式急需从以行政手段为主向以法律手段为主转化。为此，就需要全国人大授予深圳市人大及其常务委员会，在不与宪法、法律和行政法规的基本原则相抵触的前提下，制定法规的权力，同时授予深圳市人民政府行使相应的行政权即制定规章的权力。议案还规定了向全国人大常委会、国务院以及广东省人大常委会备案的制度。
