	Hot Topics: Youth Education
	By Yuán Jiàndá, Reporter for This Paper

	(Narrator: The whole nation is focused on the upcoming second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, which is set to convene. Delegates, bearing significant responsibilities, are busy preparing. On March 18, our reporter visited the fourth-floor conference room of the Communist Youth League Central Committee and felt a sense of impending action.)

	Liu Yán Dōng (Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League): Today, we have invited representatives and experts to provide feedback and opinions on the draft legislative suggestions for youth prepared by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. This will help make these suggestions more mature and feasible.

	Yè Guǎng Jùn (Deputy Professor, Beijing Medical University): Health education for youth must be emphasized. Parents and teachers should teach them about physiological knowledge and help them correctly handle interpersonal relationships, avoiding bad habits.

	Qín Chuān (Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress): The entire society should care about and pay attention to youth issues. By raising youth legislative issues at the People's Congress, we can ensure that over 2,000 delegates pay attention, making many problems easier to solve.

	Wèi Xiāng Rú (President, Beijing Youth Education Concern Association): Society should care for and help stray youth, giving them a way out and a future. The legislative bodies of the state should fully consider this when drafting laws to protect minors.

	(Narrator: Legal experts Guo Xiáng and Zhào Bǐng Zhì eagerly spoke at the meeting, offering strategies to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and using their extensive knowledge to validate the feasibility of the suggestions.)

	Kuāng Péi Zǐ (National People's Congress Representative, Director of the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences): To protect the rights of youth, legislation should include specific regulations, such as mandating that television stations broadcast a certain number of hours of children's programs and allocating a certain amount of funds for youth extracurricular education. Only then will the protection be genuine.

	(Narrator: Broadly soliciting public opinions and bringing constructive suggestions to the highest authority of the country is a testament to the strong sense of responsibility and high level of political participation among today's delegates. At today's meeting, the reporter deeply felt this.)

　　热门话题：青少年教育
    本报记者  袁建达
    （画外音：举国关注的七届全国人大二次会议就要召开了，肩负着重大使命的人民代表在忙些什么？３月１８日，记者来到共青团中央四楼会议室，感受到了一种临“战”气氛。）
    刘延东（全国人大常委、团中央书记处书记）：今天请各位代表和专家来，就是请你们对团中央草拟的有关青少年立法建议提些意见或看法，使这些建议更成熟、更可行。
    叶广俊（北京医科大学副教授）：对青少年的健康教育一定要重视。做父母、老师的，要告诉他们一些生理知识，教会他们正确处理人际关系，避免染上不良嗜好。
    秦川（全国人大常委）：全社会都要关心和重视青少年问题。把有关青少年立法问题提到人大会议上，让两千多位代表都能重视，很多问题就好解决了。
    魏相如（北京市关心青少年教育协会会长）：社会要关心和挽救失足青少年，要给他们出路，使他们有奔头。国家立法机关在制订保护未成年人法律时，需要充分考虑这一点。
    （画外音：法律专家郭翔、赵秉志等抢着在会上发言，他们有的给团中央出谋划策，有的用自己渊博的知识论证建议的可行性。）
    匡培梓（全国人大代表、中科院心理所所长）：保护青少年权益，在立法中要有一些具体规定，比如电视台播放少儿节目不得少于多少小时，拨给青少年业余教育的经费不得少于多少元等。这样，“保护”二字才会真正不落空。
    （画外音：广泛听取群众意见，把建设性的意见和建议带到我国最高的权力机关的大会上去，这是当今人民代表责任心强和参政水平提高的表现。在今天的会议上，记者深切感到了这一点。）
