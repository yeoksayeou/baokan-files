The Seventh National People's Congress, Second Session, held a press conference today for domestic and foreign journalists on the rectification and adjustment and the economic development strategy for coastal regions. Guangdong Province Governor Ye Xianping and Liaoning Province Governor Li Changchun were invited to answer questions from domestic and foreign journalists.

A Reuters reporter from the United Kingdom asked if Guangdong Province could be treated as a special case in the country's austerity policy. Ye Xianping said that in the rectification and adjustment, Guangdong cannot be special. I deeply feel that Guangdong's basic construction scale is too large, so in the rectification and adjustment, Guangdong must be resolute. Currently, Guangdong's basic construction projects have been preliminarily reduced by about 1/6.

A Tass reporter from the Soviet Union was concerned about the current development of economic cooperation between Liaoning and the Soviet Union. Li Changchun said that Liaoning has great potential for trade with the Soviet Union. After the state approved local areas to engage in direct trade with the Soviet Union last year, Liaoning's trade with the Soviet Union had a good start. Last year, Liaoning's local trade with the Soviet Union reached 1.8 billion Swiss francs, but only 300 million Swiss francs were realized, mainly due to the fact that the transportation conditions of both sides do not adapt to the development of trade.

　　就治理整顿和沿海发展战略        
    叶选平李长春答记者问
    本报北京３月３０日讯  记者凌志军、王行增报道：七届人大二次会议今天下午就治理整顿和沿海地区经济发展战略举行中外记者招待会。广东省长叶选平、辽宁省长李长春应邀回答了中外记者的提问。
    英国路透社记者问，广东省在国家的紧缩政策中是否可以作为一个特殊的省份对待？叶选平说，在治理整顿中，广东不能特殊，我也深深感到广东基本建设规模过大，所以在治理整顿中，广东要坚决办。目前，广东基本建设项目初步砍掉了１／６左右。
    苏联塔斯社记者关心的是辽宁与苏联的经济协作目前有何发展。李长春说，辽宁同苏联发展贸易潜力很大。去年国家批准地方可以和苏联搞对口地方贸易之后，辽宁与苏联的贸易有了良好的开端。去年辽宁与苏联地方贸易成交额１．８亿瑞士法郎，但仅仅实现３０００万瑞士法郎，主要是双方交通条件不适应贸易发展。
