Shenzhen's divorce rate has been on a steady rise in recent years.

According to a report in the *Shenzhen Special Zone Daily*, from January to August last year, the number of divorce cases in the city increased by about 50% compared to the same period the previous year. The Luohu District People's Court handled 14 civil cases in 1984, 45 in 1985, 89 in 1986, 127 in 1987, and 134 from January to October last year. Over 70% of these civil cases were divorce cases, and these were only the ones that failed to be resolved through mediation and had to be decided by the court.

A staff member from the Luohu District Civil Affairs Department analyzed that over 85% of the divorce cases were directly caused by the involvement of a third party. Significant changes in the status of one spouse, economic disputes, and other factors also contributed to the increase in divorce cases.

According to a civil affairs assistant from the Yuantian Subdistrict Office, there are two notable trends in the divorce cases they handle: first, there has been a significant increase in divorce cases among intellectuals; second, most of the people who actively seek divorce are "businesspeople" or "contractors." A manager of a certain commercial store has divorced twice in two years and remarried twice, and recently submitted another divorce application.

　　深圳离婚案近年猛增
    本报讯  深圳市离婚率近年来呈不断上升的趋势。
    据《深圳特区报》报道，去年１至８月，全市离婚案比前年同期增加５成左右。上埗区人民法院１９８４年受理民事案件１４宗，１９８５年４５宗，１９８６年增加到８９宗，１９８７年有１２７宗，去年１至１０月跃升到１３４宗。这些民事案件中７０％以上是离婚案件，而且仅仅是调解不成而诉诸法院裁决的。
    罗湖区民政部门的人士分析，８５％以上的离婚案的直接原因是第三者插足；配偶中一方地位发生悬殊变化、经济纠纷等也是造成离婚增多的原因。
    据该市园岭办事处民政助理员介绍，这个办事处办理的离婚案有两个特点：一是知识分子阶层离婚案显著增多；二是主动要求离婚的人多数是“生意人”或“承包者”。某商场经理，两年内两次离婚，两次结婚，前不久又再次提出离婚要求。
