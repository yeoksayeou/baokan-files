The presence of leaders from various ministries and commissions among the representatives has added vitality to the annual National People's Congress, sparking discussions among the deputies.

▲ Liang Shufen (NPC Deputy, Standing Committee of the Hubei Provincial People's Congress): It's a good thing for the leaders of various ministries and commissions to come down and listen to the representatives' opinions. They should take responsibility for what has not been done and should be done, and explain the situation when problems cannot be solved immediately. This dialogue increases mutual communication and understanding. However, there are some shortcomings. For example, in one morning, six or seven leaders from different ministries and commissions came to the Hubei delegation, making the dialogue time too rushed, and everyone felt unsatisfied.

▲ Weng Xinhu (NPC Deputy, Senior Engineer, Wuxi City Cotton Textile Mill): The dialogue and questioning put pressure on the leaders of various ministries and commissions, but it also motivates them to think more deeply; otherwise, they won't be able to give an account. From the dialogue, one can see the level of the leaders. Some ministers answer fluently, while others stammer. In the first dialogue, the representatives were not paired up; instead, they were asked to raise questions for an hour, and then the leaders spoke for an hour. Some of our leaders are used to giving reports and lack the art of dialogue and the ability to respond on the spot. We requested direct dialogue, and the second time it was changed to a question-and-answer format, which was very satisfying.

▲ Lu Wenfu (NPC Deputy, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association): The dialogue method is good. It's not just about the leaders of various ministries and commissions listening to the representatives' opinions; it's also about us listening to their opinions. Usually, we understand only part of the picture, while they see the whole picture. Even if some problems cannot be solved immediately, they tell us the root cause. This two-way exchange combines the part and the whole.

▲ Zhao Baojiang (NPC Deputy, Mayor of Wuhan City): The enthusiasm shown by the representatives for the dialogue reflects a national concern for the fate of the country. It won't succeed if only a few people, or just a few leaders at the top, are anxious and busy, while those below are indifferent. Therefore, the representatives' demand for increasing the "transparency" of national political life is completely necessary. I am not very willing to ask questions in the dialogue setting, not because I lack enthusiasm, but because I understand the difficulties of the leaders of the ministries and commissions. Before coming to Beijing, I was just questioned by the Wuhan City People's Congress representatives and deeply understand the situation.

　　对话之后评对话
    本报记者  孟晓云
    国务院部委领导人来到代表中间对话，使一年一度的人代会平添了生气，从而引发了人大代表的一些议论。
    ▲梁淑芬（人大代表、湖北省人大常委）：各部委领导下来听听代表的意见是好事。该做到没有做到的主动承担责任，一时解决不了的问题向我们说明情况，这种对话使彼此增进了沟通和理解。当然也有不尽人意之处，比如一个上午有六七个部委的负责人同时来到湖北代表团，对话时间过于仓促，大家感到不过瘾。
    ▲翁心鹤（人大代表、无锡市麻棉纺织厂高级工程师）：对话和质询对各部委领导是一种压力，同时也是一个促进，逼得他们开动脑筋，否则交不了答卷。从对话中可以看出领导人的水平，有的部长对答如流，有的则张口结舌。第一次对话没有对起来，先让代表们集中提了一个小时的问题，领导又讲了一个小时。我们有些领导习惯于做报告，缺少对话的艺术和临场应变的能力。我们要求直接对话，第二次就改成一问一答，痛快淋漓。
    ▲陆文夫（人大代表、中国作家协会副主席）：对话这种方式很好，不仅是部委领导人听取代表的意见，更重要的是我们也听取了他们的意见。平日我们了解的是局部，而他们看到的是全局，尽管有些问题不能马上解决，但也告诉了我们其症结所在。这种双向的交流将局部和全局结合起来了。
    ▲赵宝江（人大代表、武汉市市长）：代表们对对话表现出的热情体现了一种全民都关注国家命运的意向，只靠几个人，或只是上面几个领导人在焦虑，在奔忙，下面事不关己，肯定不会成功。所以代表们纷纷要求国家政治生活要增加“透明度”，是完全必要的。我在对话的场合不大愿意提问，倒不是缺乏热情，而是我深知部委领导的难处，因为我自己在来京前，刚被武汉市人大代表质询过，深知其中滋味。
