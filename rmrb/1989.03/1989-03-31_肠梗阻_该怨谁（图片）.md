    Currently, roads often experience "traffic jams." Apart from poor road conditions and inadequate management, drivers' uncivilized driving habits are a significant cause. On March 14, the ferry terminal at Zhujiang County's Chóutíng in Hubei Province was in a state of severe congestion. Vehicles on the ferry had not yet disembarked, but nearby cars and tractors rushed forward, resulting in a situation where no one could move. Who is to blame for this?

    “肠梗阻”该怨谁眼下，道路时常发生“肠梗阻”除了道路状况不好、管理欠佳外，司机不文明驾驶是重要原因。3月14日，湖北枝江县猇亭汽车轮渡码头上出现拥挤不堪的场面，轮渡上的车辆还没有下完，附近的一些汽车、拖拉机便蜂拥而上，结果，谁都走不动。这种局面怨谁呢？
