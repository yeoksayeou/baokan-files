Calligrapher Shen Peng once told me, "Go see his exhibition. It might give you some insight." As I lingered in Guo Zixu's world of calligraphy, immersed in his free and unrestrained brushwork, I also strongly felt that his characters have a certain "strangeness," that he is pursuing such a "strangeness."

I remember several years ago, when I was still a student at the China Conservatory of Music, I often went to the Academy of Arts, which was next door to our school, to chat with people. One day after lunch, I discussed the appreciation of calligraphy and painting with a friend from the art world, and we had similar feelings: If you look at a piece of calligraphy or painting and only find it beautiful and attractive, then this piece is merely at the level of "beautiful." But another piece, in addition to being beautiful, also makes you feel the author's brushwork is simple and natural, plain and genuine, then this piece has entered a higher level—sincerity. Above sincerity is the artistic realm of "antiquity" and "rusticity." The ultimate realm of artistic freedom is "strangeness." On this topic of "strangeness," I consulted Shen Peng at the celebration of the founding of Wang Xuezhong's Art Research Institute in Tianjin last year. Master Shen said, "That makes sense. 'Strangeness' can be interpreted as personality. Think about it, whether it's beauty, sincerity, antiquity, or rusticity, all have traditional genes. But 'strangeness,' which encompasses beauty, sincerity, antiquity, and rusticity, is entirely filled with personality—it is the Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou; it is Shi Tao and Zheng Banqiao; it is Wu Changshuo and Qi Baishi."

From this, I thought of our own profession of singing. It is well known that the fame of any renowned singer is inseparable from their voice. If you hear Guo Lanying, Li Shuangjiang, or Peng Liyuan's songs on the radio, you can recognize who it is just by their voice. Conversely, if you hear a voice but don't know who it is, then that person is definitely not famous. Because their voice lacks personality (charm). Take Su Xiaoming, for example. Regardless of her vocal technique and singing style, and regardless of the era and background that produced her sensation, there is one point we cannot deny: her voice is unforgettable once heard. Therefore, whether it is Guo Lanying, Li Shuangjiang, Peng Liyuan, or Su Xiaoming, if they did not have their unique personalities, they would not have become famous.

Look at today's countless singing competitions that produce numerous singers, and the countless stars that come and go like a carousel. The media often comments that they haven't even become famous before they are replaced like a carousel. Is there perhaps a reason within themselves, that they lack personality? Especially many singers who emerged in the "northwest wind" with great potential, their singing methods and styles are similar, leading to a phenomenon of mutual cancellation. I wonder if this has caught their attention? It's time to form their own distinct artistic personality!

　　艺术个性杂谈
    郁钧剑
    书法家沈鹏先生对我说：“你去看看他的展览，或许会使你有所悟。”当我流连在郭子绪书法世界中，沉浸于他那潇洒淋漓的笔墨情趣之余，又强烈地感觉到，他的字很有点“怪”味，他在追求那样的一种“怪”味。
    记得数年前我还在中国音乐学院念书时，常常到与我们学校同门的艺术研究院里找人闲聊。一天饭后，与一位美术界朋友聊起欣赏书画之道，颇有同感：如果你去看一幅字画，只觉得它光是好看、漂亮，那么这幅字画仅仅是属于“漂亮”这个档次。而另一幅字画在除了漂亮之外，还能让你感到作者的笔墨平淡自然，朴素率真时，这幅字画就进入了更高一层的档次——质朴。再高于质朴的艺术境界是“古雅”，是“拙”。而最终进入艺术自由王国的境界则是“怪”。就此“怪”论，在去年天津的王学仲先生艺术研究所成立庆典上，我请教过沈鹏先生。沈先生说，言之有理，“怪”者，可否做个性解？仔细想想，漂亮也罢，质朴古雅拙也罢，都有传统的基因在里面。而集漂亮质朴古雅拙之大成后的“怪”，则完全是充满个性的八大山人；是石涛郑板桥；是吴昌硕齐白石。
    由此，我想到了我们唱歌的本行。众所周知，任何著名歌唱家的那点“著名”，都是与他的歌声分不开的。如果在收音机里播放郭兰英、李双江、彭丽媛等人的歌，你光闻其声，就能知此声是何人。反之，如果你闻其声而不知其人者，此君就肯定难以“著名”。因为他的声音缺乏个性（魅力）。又如苏小明，我们姑且不论她的发声方法演唱技巧，姑且不论产生她轰动效应的那支歌那个时代背景，但有一点我们谁也不能否认，她本人的声音音色过耳不忘。因而无论郭兰英、李双江、彭丽媛、苏小明，若没有他们独特的个性，就绝没有他们的“著名”。
    再看看今天有无数大奖赛评选出众多的歌手，有这风那风刮起的众多明星，而报界却老评论说他们还没等走红，就如同走马灯一般的换代了。这其间是否也有他们缺乏个性的自身原因呢？尤其是不少在“西北风”中涌现出来的极有前途的歌手，在演唱方法演唱风格上的雷同，所导致产生了相互抵消的客观现象，不知是否已引起他们的重视？还是形成自己鲜明的艺术个性吧！
