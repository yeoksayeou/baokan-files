PLO and the United States Resume Formal Contact

PLO Adopts More Flexible Attitude Towards Solving the Middle East Problem

CAIRO, March 22 (Xinhua) — The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the U.S. government held a new round of formal talks in Tunis, the capital of Tunisia, today.

The U.S. representative at the talks was Robert, the U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia, while the PLO representative was Rabi, a member of the PLO Executive Committee. It was revealed that the U.S. representative requested the PLO to ease the tension in the occupied territories during the talks, while the PLO representative reiterated the three basic demands.

In addition, Abu Sharif, the press advisor to PLO Chairman Arafat, made a statement expressing willingness to accept guarantees from the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, for the resolution of the Palestinian issue, and to coordinate with the role of the United Nations. Sharif said that as long as Israel accepts the establishment of a Palestinian state, the PLO can consider allowing U.S. troops to be stationed at the sites of the Israeli military in the occupied territories. According to reports, Sharif's statement is another new attempt by the PLO to adopt a flexible policy.

　　巴解与美国再次正式接触        
    巴解对解决中东问题态度更趋灵活
    本报开罗３月２２日电  记者林皎明报道：巴勒斯坦解放组织与美国政府新的一轮正式接触今天在突尼斯首都举行。
    参加会谈的美方代表是美国驻突尼斯大使罗伯特，巴方代表是巴解执委会会员拉布。据透露，美国代表在会谈中要求巴解组织缓和被占领土的紧张局势，而巴解组织代表在会谈中再次重申３项基本要求。
    此外，巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特的新闻顾问阿布·谢里夫发表谈话，表示愿意接受由美国苏联两大国对解决巴勒斯坦问题做出担保，与联合国的作用协调。谢里夫表示，只要以色列接受巴勒斯坦国，巴解组织可以考虑允许由美国部队进驻被占领土以色列军队的据点。据报道，谢里夫这一表态，是巴解组织采取灵活政策的又一新试探。
