The United States has changed its stance and agreed to allow the Khmer Rouge to participate in the future Cambodian coalition government.

The New China News Agency reported from Washington on March 15 that U.S. Secretary of State Baker said today that the United States will change its previous position and agree to allow the Khmer Rouge to participate in the new Cambodian government.

Baker, during a hearing at the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee, said in response to a question that the Khmer Rouge must play some role in the new Cambodian government. However, he added that the United States will oppose Pol Pot himself from holding a position in the new government.

Baker had said in January's confirmation hearing that the U.S. government hopes Cambodia will become a country "free from Vietnamese occupation and free from the Red Khmer."

　　美国改变立场
    同意民柬参加未来柬联合政府
    新华社华盛顿３月１５日电  美国务卿贝克今天说，美国将改变以往立场，同意民柬方面参加未来的柬埔寨联合政府。
    贝克在参院对外工作小组委员会的听证会上回答质询时说，必须让民柬方面在新的柬埔寨政府中担任某种角色。但他又说，美国将反对波尔布特本人在新政府中任职。
    贝克在１月份的任职听证会上曾说，美国政府希望柬埔寨成为一个“摆脱越南占领和摆脱红色高棉”的国家。
