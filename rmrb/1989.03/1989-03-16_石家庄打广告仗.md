Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, March 15th.

On March 16th, the national sugar, wine, and three categories of commercial goods exchange fair will be held in Shijiazhuang. Over 50,000 factories from across the country have been waging an advertising war here since the 12th.

Inside and outside shops, on electric poles, and tree trunks, there are posters and hanging advertisements in various colors. Advertising cars with models and performance teams frequently pass through the streets. In the sky, balloons hang with large banners, and there are airships swaying. It is estimated that the cost of this advertising battle in Shijiazhuang, both in the air and on the ground, has reached tens of millions of yuan.

Opinions on this advertising war vary. A staff member from the city's price bureau told a reporter, "The advertising war makes it difficult for consumers to see the true face of things." Just take the advertisements for Dukan wine, for example. One is from a winery in Shaanxi, and the other two are from wineries in Henan. All claim to be the "authentic" ones, making it quite a mix of genuine and counterfeit products.

　　石家庄打广告仗
    据新华社石家庄３月１５日电  （通讯员王金良、记者于绍良）３月１６日要在石家庄开全国糖酒三类商品交流会，全国各地５万多个厂家１２日在这里打起了一场广告仗。
    商店内外、电线杆、树干上，贴的挂的都是广告，五颜六色；广告彩车，扭扭跶跶的模特广告表演队，在街上不时穿过；在空中，气球上悬挂着巨幅广告条幅，还有充气飞艇在摇曳。据统计，石家庄这场广告战，空中的，地上的，费用达上千万元。
    对这场广告战，人们的看法不一。市物价局一位干部对记者说，广告大战使消费者“难识庐山真面目”。单说杜康酒的广告，一家是陕西的酒厂，另两家是河南的酒厂，都说自己是“正宗”，真有点鱼龙混杂。
