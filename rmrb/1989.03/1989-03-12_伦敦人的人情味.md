The day I arrived in London, the sun was shining brightly, and the weather was warm, as if it were spring in the middle of winter. The neighbors, upon seeing me for the first time, seemed to have coordinated their greetings. They all said almost in unison, "What a beautiful sunny day, London seems to be welcoming you."

On the way from Gatwick Airport to my residence, the streets were lined with two or three-story Gothic-style houses, some of which were from the Victorian era. The air here was humid, and the grass on the ground was still lush and green. Although there weren't many flowers, occasionally, there were still some roses peeking out from the green walls.

Upon arriving at my home, just as I was about to enter, my neighbors happened to be leaving. As soon as they were introduced, I was surrounded by the family of four. They greeted me warmly, smiling and chatting enthusiastically. Looking at their sincere faces, I was so happy that I kept nodding and smiling, forgetting the prepared sentence, "It's nice to meet you."

As soon as I entered my own home, almost before I had a chance to sit down, the doorbell rang. It was the landlady. It turned out that she had prepared a small gift for me. As she handed me the gift wrapped with a red ribbon, she said affectionately, "Welcome. I've been hearing about your arrival for a while, and now you're finally here."

My first impression of Londoners was that they had such a strong sense of warmth and sincerity. It was completely devoid of any pretension or affectation. Last year, before Christmas, a British friend from another city invited us to spend the holiday at her home several times through letters and phone calls. Knowing that I spoke Spanish, she specially invited a British friend who could speak Spanish to join us. Unfortunately, that day we were too busy with work and couldn't make it. Later, I found out that on Christmas Day, her entire family and more than 20 relatives and friends waited for us for a very long time... Needless to say, my feelings of guilt and excitement were equally strong.

The warmth of Londoners is not limited to friends and acquaintances. For foreigners who have just arrived in London, it is inevitable that they will often need to ask for directions. Londoners not only tell you how to get there but also enthusiastically guide you part of the way. If they themselves don't know, they will immediately take out their own personal map to help you find the way or run to a nearby office or store to ask for directions. The enthusiasm and seriousness with which they do this are just like handling their own affairs.

Respect others, and you will be respected; help others, and you will be helped. Perhaps Londoners deeply understand this principle, which is why they have such a strong sense of warmth.

　　伦敦人的人情味
    张文英
    我到伦敦那天，阳光明媚，天气温暖，仿若冬天里的春天。邻居们第一面见到我时，像是商量好了似的，都先后不约而同地说，“多好的艳阳天，伦敦仿佛也在欢迎你。”
    从盖特维克机场到住所的路上，街道两旁多为两、三层的哥特式小洋房，有的还是维多利亚时代的建筑。这儿的空气湿润，地上的草还是绿茵茵的。虽说花已不多，但偶尔也还有未凋零的玫瑰花从绿色的围墙上探出头来。
    到了家，正要进门，恰巧邻居一家出门。一经介绍，我就被这一家四口包围在中间了。他们又是问候，又是微笑，很是热情。望着他们一张张诚挚的脸，我高兴得频频点头，报以微笑，连一路上准备好的一句话，“认识你们很高兴”都忘了说。
    进了自己家门，几乎还没坐定，门铃响了，是房东老太太。原来，她早为我准备好一份小礼品。她一边递过扎有红丝带的礼品，一边深情地说：“欢迎你，早就听说你要来，现在终于盼来了。”
    伦敦人给我的第一印象，是人情味那么浓，那么醇，它丝毫不带虚情假意，矫揉造作。去年圣诞节前，一位外地的英国朋友几次写信和打电话，邀我们去他家过节。她知道我会西班牙语，还特地请了一位能讲西班牙语的英国朋友作陪。可遗憾的是那天我们因工作太忙，终于没有去成。后来我才知道，圣诞节那天，她们全家以及２０多位亲戚朋友等了我们好久好久……不用说，我内心的负疚心理和激动的心情是同样强烈的。
    伦敦人的人情味并不局限于朋友、熟人之间。对于初到伦敦的外国人来说，出门免不了常要问路。伦敦人不仅会告诉你如何走，还会热情地给你引一段路。假如连他自己也不知道，那么他便会马上拿出自己随身携带的交通地图帮你查找，或代你跑到附近的机关或商店问路。那份热忱，那份认真，就和办自己的事一模一样。
    敬人，人敬；助人，人助。也许伦敦人深悟这一番道理，才会有那么浓的人情味。
