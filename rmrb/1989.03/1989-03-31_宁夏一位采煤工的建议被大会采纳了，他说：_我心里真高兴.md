I am truly happy. This time, attending the People's Congress, a suggestion from me, a coal miner, was adopted. Being a "delegate" like this, don't you think it feels great?

I work at the coal mining team five of the first mine in the Shizuishan Mining Bureau of Ningxia. Our mine had to borrow money to pay wages in February, and by mid-March when I came to Beijing for the meeting, the bonus for February was still not paid. Now, the whole country is eagerly waiting for coal. How can we, who have "black gold," be short of money? Who wouldn't ask this question? It's not that we can't mine it. On the contrary, we mine too much, and we have to limit production. Why? Because we can't transport it! There are no railcars!

Last year, during the People's Congress meeting, I raised this issue in a small group meeting, calling for a solution to the railcar problem. However, it didn't even make it into the _Summary Report_. This year, before the meeting, I did some research and found that the problem had become even more serious. The coal piles in the selection towers of various mines are stacked high. Our mine has a coal mountain of nearly 400,000 tons. When the wind blows, you can see the black smoke rolling. It is said that in the entire Ningxia region, the eight state-owned coal mines have accumulated more than 200 million tons of coal. Coal that has been stored for a long time can spontaneously combust, and we have to constantly drill holes and pour water to cool it down. Isn't this urgent? What was once an advantage has now become a big burden. This time, I came here determined to speak out loudly.

On the morning of March 24, Vice Minister of Railways Luo Yun Guang had a dialogue with the Ningxia delegation of People's Congress representatives. I was the second to speak. I laid out the situation of the coal mines, and the director of the Yinchuan Railway Bureau also made a statement. To my surprise, Vice Minister Luo immediately made a decision: to immediately allocate 200 railcars, specifically for transporting coal in Ningxia. Back at the hotel, I picked up my pen and wrote three letters to the regional coal bureau, the mining bureau, and our mine, quickly reporting the good news. I am truly happy!

　　宁夏一位采煤工的建议被大会采纳了，他说：        
    “我心里真高兴”
    本报记者  费伟伟
    我心里真高兴，这回参加人代会，我这个煤矿工人提的建议被采纳了，这样儿当“代表”，你说我心里美不美？
    我是宁夏石嘴山矿务局一矿采煤五队的，我们矿二月份借钱发的工资，三月中旬我来北京开会时，二月份的奖金还在天上哩。现在全国都眼巴巴盼着煤，守着“乌金”咋会没钱花？谁不这样问。不是采不出，恰好相反，是采多了，硬要限产。你说为啥？它运不出！没车皮！
    去年人大开会我在小组会上就提这个问题，呼吁解决车皮，可是连《简报》也没上。今年来开会前，我一了解，这问题更严重了。各矿井储煤场的煤都堆到了选煤楼前，我们一矿平地崛起一座将近四十万吨煤的煤山，风一来，你看吧，真正叫黑烟滚滚。据说，宁夏全区八个国家统配煤矿，积压的煤多达二百万吨以上。存放年长日久的，自己便着火，还得常打洞灌水降温。你说急人不急人？明明是优势，现今却成了个大包袱。我这回来下定决心，非大声疾呼不可。
    三月二十四日上午，铁道部副部长罗云光和我们宁夏团的人大代表对话。第二个发言的就是我。我把煤矿的情况一摆，银川铁路分局局长也作了说明。真没想到，罗副部长当场就拍了板：立即解决二百个车皮，专门给宁夏运煤。回到宾馆，我抓起笔给区煤炭厅、矿务局，还有我们一矿连写了三封信，赶紧报喜。我心里真高兴！
