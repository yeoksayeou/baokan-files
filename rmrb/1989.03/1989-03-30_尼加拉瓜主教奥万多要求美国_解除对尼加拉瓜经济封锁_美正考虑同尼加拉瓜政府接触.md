Nicaragua's Archbishop Obando calls for the U.S. to lift economic blockade on Nicaragua

The U.S. is considering contact with the Nicaraguan government

BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) — Nicaraguan Archbishop Obando on March 26 appealed to the United States to lift its economic blockade on Nicaragua.

Obando made the appeal in a radio broadcast, saying that Nicaragua has shown signs of moving towards democratization, and that the U.S. economic blockade is no longer justified.

The United States began the economic blockade in May 1985, citing Nicaragua's alleged provision of weapons to Salvadoran guerrillas. The blockade includes the suspension of credit to Nicaragua, the halt of bilateral trade, and the prohibition of Nicaraguan commercial flights to the U.S.

Obando also noted that since the March 1988 ceasefire agreement between the Nicaraguan government and the anti-government rebels in Sapoa, the civil war has effectively ended. He stated that while there have been some small-scale clashes, they do not constitute a full-scale war. According to Obando, the true meaning of war has ceased since the Sapoa agreement.

WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) — U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said today that the U.S. government is considering contact with the Nicaraguan government and is seeking solutions to the Central American problem with other Central American countries, European countries, and the Soviet Union.

She said that the U.S. will hold talks with the Nicaraguan government at an "appropriate time" and will also consult with the leaders of the other four Central American countries on regional issues.

Tutwiler stated that the change in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations will depend on the progress of Nicaragua's democratization.

Tutwiler also mentioned that Secretary of State James Baker and other State Department officials have recently met with officials from some Central American countries to discuss U.S. policy towards Central America. U.S. ambassadors to Central American and European countries have reported the current U.S. policy to their host governments and sought their opinions.

She added that the U.S. continues to engage in dialogue with the Soviet Union on the Central American issue, urging them to stop aiding the Nicaraguan government.

　　尼加拉瓜主教奥万多要求美国        
    解除对尼加拉瓜经济封锁 
    美正考虑同尼加拉瓜政府接触
    本报加拉加斯３月２８日电  记者朱满庭报道：尼加拉瓜大主教奥万多２６日向美国发出呼吁，要求解除对尼经济封锁。
    奥万多主教在一家电台广播中说，尼加拉瓜已经做出朝着民主化前进的表示，美国的经济封锁已无理由实行。
    美国自１９８５年５月开始以尼加拉瓜政府向萨尔瓦多游击队提供武器为借口，对尼实行经济封锁，中止对尼信贷，停止双边进出口贸易，禁止尼的商业航班飞抵美国等。
    奥万多还说，从去年３月尼加拉瓜政府与反政府武装在萨波亚达成停火协议后，内战实际上已停了下来。他说，一些小规模冲突算不上什么战争。自萨波亚协议后，真正意义上的战争已经停止了。
    新华社华盛顿３月２８日电美国国务院新闻发言人玛格丽特·塔特怀勒今天说，美国政府正在考虑同尼加拉瓜政府进行接触，并同其他中美洲国家、欧洲国家和苏联一起寻找解决中美洲问题的办法。
    她说，美国将在“适当时候”和尼加拉瓜政府举行会谈，并就地区性问题同中美洲其它４国领导人进行磋商。
    塔特怀勒说，美国和尼加拉瓜政府关系的变化将取决于尼加拉瓜民主化的进程。
    塔特怀勒还说，国务卿詹姆斯·贝克和国务院的一些官员最近会见了一些中美洲国家的官员，讨论美国的中美洲政策。美国驻中美洲和欧洲国家的大使已向驻在国政府通报了美国目前的政策并征求意见。
    她说，美国正在继续同苏联人就中美洲问题进行对话，敦促他们停止对尼加拉瓜政府的援助。
