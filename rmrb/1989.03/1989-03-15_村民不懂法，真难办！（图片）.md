    Villagers Don't Understand the Law, It's Really Hard to Deal With!

    Leshan Paper Mill is a large-scale key enterprise in China specializing in the production of paper for the electronics and power industries. To increase production capacity, the mill, with the approval of the relevant authorities, expanded its raw material storage area and included it in the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" key development projects. After completing all the necessary procedures and obtaining the state land use certificate, construction officially began in October of last year, with a planned completion date of mid-May this year. However, some local villagers, claiming that they did not benefit from the construction of the raw material storage area, have repeatedly obstructed the construction work. As a result, the mill has only completed 30% of the earthwork. The actions of some villagers not only delayed the construction schedule but also caused the country an economic loss of 1,750 yuan per day, which is truly heartbreaking. Villagers don't understand the law, it's really hard to deal with!

    村民不懂法，真难办！
    乐山造纸厂是我国专门生产电子工业、电力工业用纸的大型重点企业。为挖潜增产，经主管部门批准，扩建原料储备场，并列入“七五”重点开发项目。在办完各项手续，取得国家土地使用证书后，于去年十月正式破土动工，计划今年五月中旬全面竣工。然而，当地个别村民，却以建原料场他们没得到实惠为由，多次阻拦施工，致使这个厂至今只完成百分之三十的土方工程。一些村民的做法延误了工期且不说，每天给国家造成的经济损失就达一千七百五十元，实在令人痛心。村民不懂法，真难办！
