Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 16th.

How to investigate and prosecute "official speculation and profiteering" cases? How to handle legal person crimes? How to pursue criminal responsibility for relevant personnel? The Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Prosecutorate held a press conference today to issue important judicial interpretations.

Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, Lin Zhun, believes that the reasons for the weak crackdown on unit speculation and profiteering are manifold. Some cases involve many obstacles and resistance, while others have unclear policy boundaries and insufficiently clear regulations, leading to the problem of "punishment instead of criminal prosecution."

The "Provisions on Handling Criminal Cases of Speculation and Profiteering by Enterprises, Institutions, Agencies, and Organizations" published today point out that enterprises, institutions, agencies, and organizations engaging in speculation and profiteering activities refer to those that violate relevant laws, regulations, and policies of the State Council. Generally, an illegal business amount of 300,000 to 600,000 yuan, or an illegal profit amount of 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, is used as the starting point for pursuing the criminal responsibility of relevant personnel. The scope of responsibility includes the directly responsible managers and other directly responsible personnel.

The reporter noticed that the "Provisions" also point out that in cases of unit speculation and profiteering where individuals enrich themselves, if it constitutes individual speculation and profiteering, it should be punished more severely according to the law; if it constitutes embezzlement or bribery, it should be punished according to the law with multiple offenses combined.

　　处理单位投机倒把案件  高法高检作出司法解释
    本报北京３月１６日讯  记者毛磊报道：如何查处“官倒”案件？如何对待法人犯罪？如何追究有关人员刑事责任？最高人民法院与最高人民检察院今天在新闻发布会上作出了重要司法解释。
    最高人民法院副院长林准认为，对单位投机倒把打击不力的原因是多方面的，有的是干扰多、阻力大，也有的是政策界限不清、规定不够明确，存在“以罚代刑”的问题。
    今天公布的《关于当前处理企业事业单位、机关、团体投机倒把犯罪案件的规定》指出，企业事业单位、机关、团体进行投机倒把活动，是指违反国家有关法律、法规，以及国务院有关规定和政策，一般以非法经营数额达到３０万元至６０万元，或者非法获利数额达到１０万元至２０万元作为依法追究有关责任人员刑事责任的起点，追究的范围包括直接负责的主管人员和其他直接责任人员。
    记者注意到，《规定》中指出，在单位投机倒把活动中中饱私囊的，如果属于个人投机倒把，依法从重处罚；如果属于贪污或者受贿等犯罪，依法实行数罪并罚。
