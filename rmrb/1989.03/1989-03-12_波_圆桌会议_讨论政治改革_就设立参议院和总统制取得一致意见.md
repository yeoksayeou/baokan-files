The Polish "Round Table Conference" political reform subcommittee reached a consensus on March 9 regarding the establishment of a senate, a presidential system, and democratic elections for the next parliament.

According to today's report by the Polish newspaper "Republic," although some representatives expressed doubts about the necessity of establishing a senate, the majority supported the proposal, believing it would fully reflect parliamentary democracy.

On the issue of establishing a presidential system, almost all representatives took a supportive stance.

Regarding the principles of democratic elections for the next parliament, representatives advocated for "more democratic" parliamentary elections, allowing various parties and groups, including the constructive opposition, to participate in parliamentary elections. However, there were disagreements on the allocation of seats. The meeting decided to establish a special working group to discuss and formulate a unified election law to resolve existing differences.

It is understood that the Polish Council of State and Parliament will soon discuss the opinions of the "Round Table Conference" representatives and make specific decisions.

　　波“圆桌会议”讨论政治改革
    就设立参议院和总统制取得一致意见
    新华社华沙３月１０日电  波兰“圆桌会议”政治改革问题小组９日就设立参议院、总统制以及民主选举下届议会问题取得一致意见。
    据波《共和国报》今天报道，尽管个别代表在会上对设立参议院的必要性表示怀疑，但绝大多数代表赞成这一建议，认为这将充分体现议会民主。
    关于设立总统制问题，几乎所有代表都采取赞同的立场。
    关于民主选举下届议会的原则问题，代表们主张今后议会选举“应更加民主”，“应允许各党派、团体，包括建设性反对派参加议会选举”等，但在议席分配问题上有分歧。会议决定成立专门工作组，以讨论和制定统一的选举法，消除目前存在的某些分歧。
    据悉，波兰国务委员会和议会近期将讨论“圆桌会议”代表的上述意见并作出具体决定。
