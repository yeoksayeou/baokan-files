Recently, experts from the Guizhou Academy of Sciences conducted an on-site investigation of the Wujiaodu Hydropower Station and concluded that the station is under severe threat from sediment deposition and must take immediate measures to address the issue.

The Wujiaodu Hydropower Station is located on the upper reaches of the main stream of the Wujiang River. It is the first large-scale hydropower station built in a limestone region in China and one of the 14 large-scale hydropower stations in the country, with a total installed capacity of 630,000 kilowatts and an annual power generation of 3.34 billion kilowatt-hours. The station's generators were put into operation between January 1980 and February 1983.

However, in recent years, due to the continuous destruction of forest vegetation within the reservoir's catchment area and the presence of large areas of terraced farmland on the banks of the upstream and several major tributaries, soil erosion has become increasingly severe, resulting in a continuous influx of sediment into the reservoir. According to expert measurements, the reservoir has already accumulated 180 million cubic meters of sediment, equivalent to 270 million tons. The height of the sediment deposition has reached 660 meters, equivalent to the sediment deposition height designed for 100 years in the future, causing two industrial (cooling for power generation) and living water intake points to be silted up and rendered unusable. The remaining water intake point is only 5 meters away from the sediment. Experts estimate that if no effective measures are taken, this intake point will also be silted up within 5 to 7 years. At that time, the power station will be unable to operate and generate electricity.

### 泥沙淤积　乌江渡电站濒危  专家建议　早动手认真治理

　　泥沙淤积　乌江渡电站濒危
    专家建议　早动手认真治理
    日前，贵州科学院有关专家实地考察乌江渡水电站后认为：该电站正受到泥沙淤积的严重威胁，必须及时采取措施加以治理。
    乌江渡水电站位于乌江主干流上游，是我国目前在石灰岩地区建成的第一个大型水电站，也是全国１４个大型水电站之一，总装机容量为６３万千瓦，年发电量为３３．４亿度。该电站各机组１９８０年１月至１９８３年２月间相继投产。
    但是，这些年来，由于该电站水库流域范围内的森林植被不断遭到破坏，加之上游和几大支流两岸仍然保持着大量的坡耕地，以致水土流失日趋严重，大量泥沙源源不断地注入水库。根据专家实测，目前水库已蓄泥沙１．８亿立方米，约合２．７亿吨。泥沙淤积高程已达６６０米，相当于设计时百年后的泥沙淤积高程，使两个高程的工业（冷却发电机用）及生活取水口先后被淤，不能使用。现剩下的一个高程取水口，距泥沙也仅５米。据推算，如不及时采取有效措施，预计再有５至７年，也将被泥沙淤塞。届时，这个电站无法运行发电。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　本报记者　潘帝都
