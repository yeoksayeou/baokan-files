Beijing is set to launch a large-scale, long-term campaign to promote civilized behavior in anticipation of next year's Asian Games.

"In terms of venue construction, opening and closing ceremonies, and competition organization, we will not be inferior to South Korea," said Zhang Baifu, vice chairman of the 11th Asian Games Organizing Committee. Zhang is known for his straightforwardness.

However, this Beijing municipal vice mayor expressed significant concerns about whether Beijing's citizens will be able to leave a good impression during the Asian Games in September next year.

Today, Zhang invited some journalists in Beijing to visit the ongoing construction of the Asian Games facilities. During a discussion, he revealed that Beijing will soon initiate a large-scale civilized behavior campaign lasting one and a half years. During this period, tens of thousands of volunteers will be deployed to maintain order and correct bad behaviors on the streets.

The public transportation company has decided to implement separate doors for boarding and alighting on buses. For example, on a three-door bus, passengers are required to board through the middle door and alight through the front and rear doors. On a two-door bus, passengers should board through the rear door and alight through the front door. Fines for violations such as cycling in the wrong direction and spitting in public will be significantly increased.

Some people have worried that, due to the low moral standards of certain individuals, hosting the Asian Games in Beijing might result in wasted money and embarrassment. Zhang Baifu believes that this large-scale civilized behavior campaign will bring a new spiritual image to Beijing.

During today's discussion, Zhang Baifu also hoped that Beijing's enterprises and factories would play a more active role in the construction of the Asian Games. He gave an example, saying that the familiar Beijing Cola will disappear from all related activities during the Asian Games. Instead, it will be replaced by Guangdong's Healthy Power drink. This is because Healthy Power provided more favorable competition conditions.

There are several similar incidents. Zhang Baifu stated that Beijing's leaders cannot use administrative means to protect local factories.

　　迎亚运　创新貌
    北京将发起大规模讲文明活动
    新华社北京３月１８日电  （记者曲北林）北京将发起一个声势浩大，旷日持久的文明活动，以迎接明年的亚运会。
    “在场馆建设，开幕式、闭幕式、竞赛组织方面，我们不会比南朝鲜差”，第１１届亚运会组委会副主席张百发今天说。
    但是这位以讲实话闻名的北京市副市长，对北京市民的文明水平能否在明年９月的亚运会期间留下美好的纪录，表示很大的担忧。
    张百发今天邀请在京的一些新闻记者参观了正在建设中的亚运会工程。他在座谈时透露，北京市不久将开展为期一年半的大规模文明活动。届时将有成千上万的志愿者上街维持交通，纠正不良行为。
    公交公司已经决定，公共汽车要实行上、下车用门分开。如：三门车，规定只许中门上，前、后门下。两门车，规定后门上，前门下。对骑车违章、随地吐痰者要大大增加罚款金额。
    有些人曾担心，由于某些人的道德水平不高，在北京搞亚运会，会花了钱，还丢脸。张百发认为，北京市的这次大规模文明活动，将给北京带来新的精神风貌。
    在今天的座谈会上，张百发还希望北京的企业、厂家在亚运会建设中，发挥更积极的作用。他举例说，北京市民司空见惯的北冰洋汽水在亚运会的一切有关活动中，都将消失。取而代之的，将是广东的健力宝饮料。因为健力宝提供了比北冰洋更优越的竞争条件。
    类似的事件还有几起。张百发表示，北京市的领导者，不能采用行政手段来保护本地的厂家。
