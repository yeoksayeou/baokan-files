    The current focus of rectification and restructuring is still to reduce social demand.
    Li Peng says fixed asset investment this year should be reduced by 21% compared to last year

    New China News Agency, Beijing, March 20th - Premier Li Peng, in his government work report to the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, said that the current focus of rectification and restructuring is still to reduce social demand.

    He said, the inflation in our country in recent years has mainly been caused by overheating of the economy and excessive demand. Reducing the scale of fixed asset investment is a major measure that has a decisive impact on reducing total social demand, and it is the primary task to curb inflation and stabilize the overall economy. The State Council has decided: this year, the scale of fixed asset investment in the whole society should be reduced by 92 billion yuan compared to last year, a decrease of 21%; among which, the investment scale of state-owned enterprises should be reduced by 51 billion yuan, a decrease of 19%.

    Li Peng said, the key to reducing and controlling the scale of fixed asset investment is to clean up ongoing projects. Each department and locality must follow the industrial policies and the list of ongoing projects issued by the State Council, and conduct a thorough cleanup, stopping or delaying construction of projects that should be stopped or delayed, and not allowing any deception or fraud. During the period of rectification and restructuring, it is necessary to strictly control new projects. Any project that has not been approved according to regulations must not be started; those that have started construction without authorization must be strictly held accountable by the construction unit and its supervising department.

    He said, in the process of rectification and restructuring, it is also necessary to strictly control the rapid growth of consumption demand. It is necessary to strictly reduce and control collective consumption. This year, the national collective purchasing power should be reduced by 20% based on the 1988 level. Strictly control the growth of total wages, and resolutely stop the issuance of bonuses, goods, and the expansion of allowances and subsidies without authorization. Strengthen the management of wage funds, rectify and improve the wage and bonus issuance methods of enterprises, especially various companies, rectify and strengthen the management and supervision of enterprise self-owned funds, and strictly collect bonus tax and wage adjustment tax according to state regulations. Promote and encourage people's savings, and adopt various methods to correctly guide consumption, absorb and postpone the realization of social surplus purchasing power. All macroeconomic management departments and supervisory departments must take responsibility and strengthen the control and supervision of consumption demand.

　　当前治理整顿重点仍是压缩社会需求        
    李鹏说今年固定资产投资要比上年减２１％
    新华社北京３月２０日电  国务院总理李鹏在七届全国人大二次会议作政府工作报告时说，当前治理整顿的重点仍然是压缩社会需求。
    他说，我国近年来的通货膨胀，主要是由经济过热、需求过旺引发的。压缩固定资产投资规模，是对压缩社会总需求具有决定性影响的重大措施，是抑制通货膨胀、稳定经济全局的首要任务。国务院已经决定：今年全社会固定资产投资规模要比上年压缩９２０亿元，减少２１％；其中，全民所有制单位投资规模压缩５１０亿元，减少１９％。
    李鹏说，压缩和控制固定资产投资规模，关键是清理在建项目。各部门各地方必须按照国务院颁布的产业政策和清理在建项目目录，对号入座，认真清理，该停建缓建的坚决停建缓建，决不允许弄虚作假。在治理整顿期间，必须切实控制新开工项目，凡是没有按规定报经批准的，一律不得开工；擅自开工的，必须严格追究建设单位及其主管部门的责任。
    他说，在治理整顿中，还必须坚决控制消费需求的过快增长。坚决压缩和控制社会集团消费。今年的全国社会集团购买力，要在１９８８年水平的基础上压缩２０％。严格控制工资总额的增长，坚决制止滥发奖金、实物和擅自扩大津贴、补贴的发放范围。加强对工资基金的管理，整顿和改进企业特别是各类公司工资、奖金的发放办法，整顿和加强企业自有资金的管理和监督，严格按国家规定征收奖金税和工资调节税。大力提倡和鼓励人民储蓄，并采取多种办法正确引导消费，吸收和推迟实现社会结余购买力。所有的宏观经济管理部门和监督部门，都要切实地负起责任来，加强对消费需求的控制和监督。
