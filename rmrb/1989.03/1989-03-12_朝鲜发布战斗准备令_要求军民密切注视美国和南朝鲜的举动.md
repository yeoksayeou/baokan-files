The Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army today issued a combat readiness order regarding the joint military exercise "Cooperation Spirit 89" to be held by the United States and South Korea from March 14 to 23.

This combat readiness order was announced in a news release issued by the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army today. The order calls for all members of the Korean People's Army, the People's Security Forces, the Workers' and Peasants' Red Guards, and the Red Youth Guards to be fully prepared for all combat mobilizations.

The news release states that the U.S. and South Korean authorities, despite repeated objections from the North, insist on holding large-scale military exercises. This is a serious provocation against the North and a serious threat to peace in Asia and the world. The North's mobilization of the People's Army and the People's Security Forces, who are engaged in socialist economic construction, to be prepared for any situation is a self-defense measure against war provocations. If the U.S. and South Korean authorities insist on imposing war on the Korean people, the armed forces and all the people of Korea will unite to defend their sacred land and precious revolutionary achievements.

The news release calls on all the people of Korea to heighten their revolutionary vigilance, closely monitor the actions of the United States and South Korea, maintain a state of high alert at all times, and be ready to crush any war provocations, building a steel wall to defend the motherland.
