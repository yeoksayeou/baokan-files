More than 2,000 self-employed individuals in China have decided to show their patriotism by donating 20 million yuan to build a gymnasium for the Asian Games. The gymnasium will be named the "Chinese Individual Laborers and Private Enterprise Operators Gymnasium."

On the afternoon of March 22, National People's Congress delegate and vice-chairman of the China Individual Laborers Association, Hu Dapeng, announced this decision at a discussion meeting of the Beijing delegation. It is reported that the unfinished Moon Temple Gymnasium in Beijing will be the gymnasium they are donating. This is also the first gymnasium in the country to be built through collective fundraising.

　　两千万个体户向亚运会捐赠一座体育馆
    中新社北京３月２３日电  （记者张亮）中国２０００余万个体户决定向国家表示爱国之心——向亚运会捐资２０００万元人民币用以建造一座体育馆，并命名为“中国个体劳动者和私营企业经营者体育馆”。
    全国人大代表、中国个体协会副会长胡大鹏２２日下午在北京代表团的讨论会中，宣布了这一决定。据悉，目前尚未竣工的北京月坛体育馆将作为他们捐赠的体育馆。这也是全国第一座靠团体集资捐赠的体育馆。
