Recently, the State Statistical Bureau provided a report indicating that after three consecutive years of reduction, the area of oilseed crops in China is set to increase this year. It is estimated that the planting area will increase by over 400 million mu compared to last year. Specifically, the areas for sesame, peanuts, and rapeseed will increase by 8.3%, 4.9%, and 1.8% respectively.

The primary reasons for the increase in oilseed planting areas are as follows: first, various regions have placed significant emphasis on oilseed production and have implemented several preferential policies. Second, oilseed crops offer high returns, wide market demand, ease of management, and are suitable for various soil types, making them popular among farmers. In some major producing areas, the market price of oil has risen significantly, thereby stimulating farmers' production enthusiasm. For instance, the peanut planting areas in Shandong and Henan provinces are expected to increase by 4.3% and 5.9% respectively compared to last year.

The report also points out that the yield per unit area of oilseed crops in China remains relatively low, with significant potential for increase. The national average yield per mu for oilseeds was highest in 1984 at 92 kilograms, but it dropped to 83 kilograms last year. The average yield per mu for peanuts is 136 kilograms, with the highest in Shandong province at 200 kilograms. However, nearly 10 provinces and regions have an average yield per mu below 100 kilograms.

　　连跌三年后回升        
    油料扩种四百万亩
    本报北京３月２７日讯  国家统计局最近提供的一份资料表明：今年我国的油料种植面积在连续３年调减的情况下将有所回升，预计播种面积比去年增加４００多万亩，其中，芝麻、花生、油菜籽分别增长８．３％、４．９％和１．８％。
    油料播种面积增加的主要原因是：一、各地普遍重视油料生产，制定了一些优惠政策。二、油料作物收益高、销路广、易管理、肥土壤，农民乐意种。在一些主产区，市场油价上涨幅度较大，从而刺激了农民的生产积极性。其中，山东、河南的花生种植面积将分别比去年增加４．３％、５．９％。
    这份资料还指出：我国目前油料作物单产仍较低，增产潜力很大。全国油料平均亩产，历史最高的１９８４年为９２公斤，去年降为８３公斤。花生平均亩产为１３６公斤，最高的山东省为２００公斤，但有近１０个省、区平均亩产在１００公斤以下。
