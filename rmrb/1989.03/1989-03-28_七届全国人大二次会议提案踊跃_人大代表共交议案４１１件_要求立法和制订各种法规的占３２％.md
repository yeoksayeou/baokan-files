	Vigorous Proposals at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress
	People's Representatives Submit 411 Proposals
	32% Call for Legislation and Formulation of Various Regulations

	BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- By 6 p.m. on March 26, the Secretariat of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress had received a total of 411 proposals. Among these, 131 proposals, accounting for 32% of the total, called for the speeding up of the formulation of various laws and regulations during this session.

	This year, a relatively large number of proposals have called for legislation, indicating that the representatives' legal awareness is increasing. A proposal submitted by 150 representatives is concerned with "solving the problem of insufficient energy and coal funds and urban coal supply." Yusufo·Aisha and 40 other representatives, Gao Sufang and 32 other representatives, have called for the prompt promulgation of the "Urban Law" and the "Urban Management Law."

	The proposals submitted by the representatives reflect their concern for education and the construction of a clean government. Some representatives have proposed accelerating the drafting of the "Teachers Law," while others have suggested that the People's Congress draft specific regulations to ensure the growth of educational funds. Some representatives have proposed implementing the "Compulsory Education Law" to stop student dropouts and children from quitting school. Wu Kangmin and other representatives have also suggested drafting anti-corruption regulations as soon as possible. They believe that certain corrupt practices within the party and government have caused widespread dissatisfaction among the people. Therefore, it is necessary to draft an anti-corruption regulation promptly, providing the people with a legal basis to supervise cadres, especially high-ranking officials.

　　七届全国人大二次会议提案踊跃        
    人大代表共交议案４１１件        
    要求立法和制订各种法规的占３２％
    本报北京３月２７日讯  记者段存章报道：截至２６日下午６时，七届全国人大二次会议大会秘书处，共收到各类议案４１１件。其中，要求本次会议加快制定各种法律和法规的共有１３１件，占到议案总数的３２％。
    今年要求立法的议案较多，说明代表的法律意识在增强。一个由１５０名代表提出的议案，关心的是“解决能源煤炭资金不足和城市煤炭供应问题”。玉素甫·艾沙等４０名代表，高素芳等３２名代表要求尽快颁布《城市法》、《市政管理法》。
    关心教育和关心国家机关廉政建设，在代表议案中得到体现。有的代表提出加快制订《教师法》，有的代表建议人大制订单项法规确保教育经费增长；有的代表提出贯彻实施《义务教育法》，制止学生流失、儿童辍学。吴康民等代表还建议迅速制订廉政法规。他们认为，党政机关的某些腐败现象，广大群众十分不满，应迅速拟订一个廉政法规，使人民有监督干部、特别是高级干部的法律依据。
