The leaders of the three forces of the KPNLF jointly issued a declaration today, deciding to establish the Supreme National Defense Council. Its mission is to ensure the unity and cooperation of the three forces' armies.

The Xinhua News Agency reported from Beijing on March 14 that at noon today, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the KPNLF, Prime Minister Son Sann of the KPNLF United Front Government, and Vice Chairman Khieu Samphan, in charge of foreign affairs of the KPNLF, held a press conference at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse and issued a joint declaration.

This declaration was decided upon after Prince Norodom Sihanouk resumed his position as Chairman of the KPNLF and convened a special meeting in Beijing on March 12, attended by the leaders of the three forces.

The declaration first emphasized that in order to liberate Cambodia as soon as possible, the three forces of the KPNLF are determined to further strengthen their unity. To this end, they decided to establish a Supreme National Defense Council directly led by the leaders of the three forces. The mission of the Council is to ensure the unity, cooperation, mutual respect, and assistance among the three forces' armies.

The declaration pointed out that the nature of the conflict in Cambodia is not an internal war among the Cambodian people, but an invasion and colonial war waged by Vietnam.

The declaration reiterated that Vietnam must withdraw all its troops from Cambodia, whether openly or secretly, in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations on the Cambodian issue. Now, the Cambodian people desire peace more than anyone else, but without absolute independence, without full freedom and self-determination, the Cambodian people will absolutely not accept such "peace."

The leaders of the three forces of the KPNLF also answered questions raised by reporters.

　　民柬三方领导人联合声明  决定成立国防最高委员会     
    使命是保证三方军队团结合作
    本报北京３月１４日讯  记者顾玉清报道：今天中午１２时，民柬主席西哈努克亲王、民柬联合政府总理宋双和民柬负责外交事务的副主席乔森潘在钓鱼台国宾馆举行记者招待会，发表了一项联合声明。
    这项声明是西哈努克亲王恢复民柬主席职务以来，于３月１２日在北京主持召开了一次有三方领导人参加的特别会议后决定发表的。
    声明首先强调，为使柬埔寨尽快获得解放，民柬抵抗力量三方决心继续加强团结，为此，他们决定成立一个由三方领导人直接领导的国防最高委员会。委员会的使命是保证三方军队的团结、合作、相互尊重和帮助。
    声明指出，柬埔寨冲突的性质决不是柬埔寨人之间的内部战争，而是越南进行的一场侵略和殖民战争。
    声明重申，越南必须按照联合国关于柬埔寨问题的有关决议，从柬埔寨撤走它的全部军队，不论是公开的还是隐藏的。现在柬埔寨人民比谁都渴望和平，但是，没有百分之百的独立，没有充分的自由和自决权的“和平”，柬埔寨人民是绝对不能接受的。
    民柬三方领导人还分别回答了记者提出的问题。
