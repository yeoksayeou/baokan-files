In recent years, due to the impact of various forms of art and entertainment, some performance companies have had a tough time. However, the Shenyang City Performance Company has achieved remarkable results. In 1988, it realized a profit of 1.41 million yuan, equivalent to two and a half times the total profit of the three years from 1984 to 1986. It has been consecutively awarded the honor of being an advanced unit in the country and Liaoning Province for "using culture to support culture," and has been commended by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Culture.

How were these achievements made? The company's leadership believes that the key is to implement several transformations: no longer just a platform for propaganda and education, nor merely a venue for film and theater performances, but a place that meets the diverse cultural and spiritual needs of the masses; shifting from a management and welfare-oriented approach to a service and operation-oriented approach; no longer relying on the state, but facing the cultural market with a competitive and progressive attitude, transitioning from a closed system to an open one, and embarking on a path of self-development and sustainable growth.

The Shenyang Art Hall, under the company's management, was once on the brink of loss due to outdated equipment and a single business model. After two months of renovation, the originally single-function movie theater transformed into a comprehensive entertainment facility integrating a dance hall, video hall, Western restaurant, coffee shop, movie theater, beauty salon, billiard room, and store. In 1988, it realized a profit of 600,000 yuan, an increase of 30 times compared to the past.

Over the past few years, the company has successively partnered with 10 cities in the three northeastern provinces, as well as municipalities directly under the central government and separately planned cities, forming a network of performance cooperation. This ensures that various artistic performance groups of different styles and forms continuously come to Shenyang to perform. Last year alone, 118 performance groups from other provinces and cities were hosted. Various theaters, while generally undergoing potential and transformation, have engaged in 15 outward-oriented operations, either showing films and videos or hosting dance parties, billiard games, and other entertainment activities. This not only enriches the cultural life of Shenyang but also achieves significant economic benefits.

　　以文补文提供多种服务
    沈阳演出公司效益显著
    本报讯  近年来，由于多种文艺和娱乐形式的冲击，一些演出公司的日子不大好过。沈阳市演出公司却取得了令人瞩目的成绩，１９８８年实现利润１４１万元，相当于１９８４年至１９８６年三年完成利润总和的两倍半，先后被授予全国和辽宁省以文补文先进单位的光荣称号，受到了财政部、文化部的嘉奖。
    这些成就是如何取得的呢？公司领导认为，最重要的是实行了几个转变：不再是单纯宣传教育阵地，也不仅仅演映影剧，而是满足群众多种精神文化需求的活动场所，由管理福利型变为经营服务型；不再依赖国家，而是面向文化市场竞争进取，由封闭型向开放型转变，走上自我发展良性循环的轨道。
    公司所属的沈阳文艺厅曾因设备陈旧，经营项目单一，濒临亏损的边缘。经过两个月的改造，原来单一的电影厅变成了拥有舞厅、录像厅、西餐厅、咖啡厅、电影厅、美容厅、台球室、商店等多种功能为一体的综合性娱乐设施。１９８８年实现利润６０万元，比过去增加了３０倍。
    几年来，公司先后同东北３省１０城市，全国直辖市和计划单列城市实行联合，形成纵横交错的演出联合体网络，保证了各个不同风格、不同形式的艺术表演团体络绎不绝地来沈献艺，去年一年就接待外省市演出团体１１８个。各剧场在普遍进行挖潜改造的同时，搞外向型经营１５处，或演映影剧、录像，或举办舞会、台球等娱乐活动，既丰富了沈阳市的文化生活，又取得了明显的经济效益。
