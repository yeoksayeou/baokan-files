Energy tightness, the nation focuses on Shanxi.
Shanxi takes full responsibility to dig coal.

	People's Daily, Beijing, March 22nd report: People's Daily reporters Duancunchang, Shanxi Daily reporter Wang Jianrong report: Energy is tight, and the nation's attention is on Shanxi. National People's Congress representative and Shanxi Province Governor Wang Senhao said, Shanxi should make a contribution to easing the nationwide energy tightness.

	Shanxi produces 246 million tons of coal annually, exporting 175 million tons. Last year, despite facing many difficulties in coal production, Shanxi, in order to support national construction and consider the overall situation, overcame numerous challenges to increase coal production. The annual output grew by 6.9% compared to the previous year. This year, January saw a 4.1% increase, February a 1.7% increase, and March's production is also good. Shanxi currently has over 20 million tons of coal in storage.

	In the latter half of last year, Shanxi's coal production encountered new situations and problems. First, resource conditions changed, and some township coal mines exhausted their shallow coal reserves, requiring them to develop deeper layers and increase investment. However, the funding gap is too large. Second, since last year, the prices of negotiated grain and sideline products have surged, reducing miners' actual living standards, and some out-of-province laborers have begun to return. Third, over the past few years, the prices of raw materials needed by coal mines, highway transportation, and coal station loading fees have all risen significantly. The cost per ton of coal to load onto a train has increased from 25 yuan to around 35 yuan, but the coal price remains at the 1985 level of 33 to 37 yuan per ton, making coal mining unprofitable. Many coal mines have to use maintenance fees to cover losses, seriously affecting the production enthusiasm and development momentum of coal mines.

	To address the problems in coal production, the State Council has taken a series of supportive measures. To reduce the pressure of Shanxi coal transportation on railway transportation, Wang Senhao suggested that the state build large-scale thermal power stations along the Yellow River in Shanxi's water-rich areas. On one hand, this would send electricity out, and on the other hand, it would develop high-energy-consuming products such as steel, aluminum, calcium carbide, and coal chemical industry locally.

### 能源紧张　全国瞩目山西  责无旁贷　山西全力挖煤

　　能源紧张　全国瞩目山西        
    责无旁贷　山西全力挖煤
    本报北京３月２２日讯  本报记者段存章、山西日报记者王建荣报道：能源紧张，全国瞩目山西。全国人大代表、山西省省长王森浩说，山西要为缓和全国能源紧张再作贡献。
    山西年产煤２．４６亿多吨，外调１．７５亿吨。去年山西在煤炭生产困难较多的情况下，为了支援国家建设，顾全大局，千方百计克服困难，增加煤炭生产，全年产量比上年增长６．９％。今年１月增长４．１％，２月增长１．７％，３月生产也好。山西现在还存煤２０００多万吨。
    去年下半年，山西煤炭生产出现了新情况、新问题。一是资源条件变化，一些乡镇煤矿浅层煤逐渐挖完，要向深部发展，需要扩大井型，增加投入。但资金缺口太多。二是去年以来议价粮和副食品大幅度涨价，矿工实际生活水平下降，一些外省劳力开始回流。三是几年来煤矿所需原材料价格、公路集运和煤站装车费用都大幅度上涨，每吨煤到上火车的成本由２５元上升到３５元左右，但煤价仍保持１９８５年的每吨３３元至３７元，挖煤无利可图，许多煤矿不得不用维检费弥补亏损，严重影响煤矿的生产积极性和发展后劲。
    针对煤炭生产中的问题，国务院已采取一系列扶持措施。为了减轻晋煤外运对铁路运输的压力，王森浩建议国家在黄河沿岸山西的富水地区建设大型火电站，一方面向外送电，一方面就地发展钢铁、铝材、电石、煤化工等高耗能产品。
