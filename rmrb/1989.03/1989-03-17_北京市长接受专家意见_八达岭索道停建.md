Beijing Mayor Accepts Experts' Advice to Halt Construction of Badaling Cable Car

Beijing, March 16 — The Beijing Municipal Government recently decided to halt the construction of the Badaling Great Wall cable car project, thus ending a two-year-long debate over whether to build the cable car.

On the morning of March 8, Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong and Deputy Mayors Zhang Baifa and He Luli met with four renowned urban planning and landscape architecture experts—Shan Shiyuan, Zheng Xiaoxian, Luo Zhewen, and Xie Ninggao—at the municipal government to discuss the Badaling Great Wall cable car. The four experts presented their arguments for protecting the Badaling Great Wall as a world cultural heritage site. Representatives from the relevant construction units emphasized that the project was a joint venture with Hong Kong investors and that halting construction would result in significant economic losses. After extensive consultations and discussions, weighing the pros and cons, Mayor Chen Xitong ultimately adopted the experts' advice and decided to halt the construction of the Badaling Great Wall cable car. The Beijing Municipal Government's decision was praised by the experts.
