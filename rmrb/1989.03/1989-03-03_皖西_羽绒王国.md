The Anhui province's Liu'an region has become the largest white goose breeding area and the largest down distribution center in the country. Last year, the region's goose population reached 11 million, producing over 1.6 million kilograms of down.

Anhui West white geese are one of the five excellent breeds in the country, with a large body size, white down, large fluff, long down, and good elasticity. In recent years, Anhui West down has been popular both domestically and internationally. Especially in Guzhen, 40 kilometers away from Liu'an City, a 9,300-square-meter professional down market has been established, attracting more than 200 down manufacturers and merchants. The market handles about 10,000 kilograms of down (including duck down) daily, with a transaction volume of over 500,000 yuan. The area has become the largest down distribution center in the country, earning the title of "The Down Kingdom."
