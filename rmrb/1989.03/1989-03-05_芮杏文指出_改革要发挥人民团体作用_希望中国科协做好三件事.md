	Ke Rui Xing Wen pointed out at the 3rd National Congress of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology's 4th Plenary Session that over the past decade of reform and opening up, China has achieved tremendous success, but it also faces numerous problems. However, one thing is certain: the path we have taken is correct. We must firmly continue on this path. Our overall policy of reform and opening up will not change, and our adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles as the foundation of our nation will not change.

	He emphasized that to continue with reform, in addition to the correct leadership and decision-making of the Party and the government, we must also gain the full understanding, participation, and support of the broad masses of the people. Including the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, all people's organizations bear heavy responsibilities and can play significant roles.

	He hopes that the Chinese Association for Science and Technology will accomplish three tasks: first, to carry out reforms within the association; second, to do a good job in serving the national construction and reform; third, to better play the role of a bridge between the Party and the government and the scientific and technological workers, and to assist in the development of science and technology.

　　芮杏文指出
    改革要发挥人民团体作用
    希望中国科协做好三件事
    据新华社北京３月４日电  （记者姜在忠）中共中央书记处书记芮杏文今天在中国科协三届四次全委会上说，改革开放十年来，中国取得了巨大的成绩，面临的问题也不少。但有一条可以肯定，就是我们走的路子是对的。我们要坚定地继续走下去。我们改革开放的总方针、总政策不变，我们坚持四项基本原则的立国之本不变。
    他强调，要坚持改革，除了党和政府的正确领导和决策外，还必须取得广大人民群众的充分理解、参与和支持。包括中国科协在内的各人民团体都肩负着重大的责任，都可以发挥重大的作用。
    他希望中国科协做好三件事情：一是搞好科协的自身改革；二是搞好为全国建设和改革服务的有关工作；三是更好地发挥党和政府联系科技工作者的纽带及发展科技的助手作用。
