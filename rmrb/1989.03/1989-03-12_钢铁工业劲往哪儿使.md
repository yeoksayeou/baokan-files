Over the past few years, China's steel industry has seen significant development, with an annual increase of 300 million tons for five consecutive years, reaching a total annual steel production of 59.22 million tons. However, since the second half of last year, due to insufficient coal and electricity supply and tight transportation, steel production has noticeably declined, and many ferroalloy enterprises have an operating rate of only 50% to 60%.

Entering 1989, this situation has not eased and has even worsened in some regions. Many large steel enterprises have seen a significant drop in coal reserves, with some falling below the critical point. This year, the state will implement a maximum price for steel products and introduce new taxes, increasing certain fees, with the industry expected to see a full-year reduction in profits of 40 to 50 billion yuan. Under these circumstances, many steel enterprises are struggling, feeling helpless in production. Is this really the case? Looking at the following figures and facts, one can find a way out.

	•	Currently, China produces over 470 million tons of various steel materials annually, with the majority being common types such as rebar, strip steel, and coil steel. However, the board and tube materials urgently needed by the national economy are in short supply and have to be imported from abroad. According to statistics from relevant departments, from 1983 to 1987, 34.69 million tons of board and tube steel were imported, accounting for 48.3% of the total steel imports during the same period, equivalent to 52.8% of the domestic production of boards and tubes. Among these, 14.71 million tons of thin plates were imported, equal to 80.5% of the domestic thin plate production during the same period. In recent years, the prices of board and tube materials in the international market have surged dramatically, with oil pipes rising from $479 per ton to $840 per ton, a 75% increase; cold-rolled thin plates have risen from $290 per ton to $550 per ton, a 90% increase. Therefore, it is urgent to increase the production of hot-rolled plates, cold-rolled plates, galvanized plates, tin-plated plates, silicon steel sheets, medium-thick plates, and seamless tubes that are in short supply.

	•	In recent years, although the quality of China's steel products has improved, the "double standard rate" is still less than 30%. Even when producing steel according to international and advanced foreign standards, it is still less than 1/3. Compared to Japan and Europe and America, the gap is significant. Domestic-produced automobile gears have low performance and poor quality, with a lifespan only half that of foreign counterparts. In construction engineering, low-strength bulldozers, excavators, and other machinery can be produced domestically, but high-strength ones need to be imported...

	•	The steel industry is a major energy consumer, consuming about 60 million tons of coking coal annually. Currently, the energy consumption indicators of some steel enterprises vary greatly. Good enterprises need only 900 kilograms of standard coal to produce one ton of steel, while poor ones need over 1300 kilograms. Other technical and economic indicators also vary significantly.

From the above facts, it can be seen that in the future, the steel industry should focus on adjusting the product structure, improving product quality and variety, reducing energy consumption, and tapping internal potential.

In adjusting the product structure, the focus should be on developing board and tube materials that are in short supply, especially increasing the self-sufficiency rate of steel used in power generation, railways, petroleum, automobiles, and light industry, and reducing the use of foreign exchange for steel imports. To meet these needs, the originally planned renovation of old plants and reconstruction using foreign capital should be adjusted accordingly. Attracting funds to concentrate limited funds on the construction of board and tube rolling mills for the above-mentioned urgently needed varieties. Prioritize the renovation and expansion of old plants with good foundations and good investment returns, enabling them to produce high-level products in a specialized and batch manner according to demand. Projects that do not use state foreign exchange and can be self-financed by enterprises with their own production and self-raised foreign exchange and domestic matching funds should be given priority. In short, we can no longer hesitate or be indecisive in developing short-supply products. We should adjust to increase cold-rolled plates, hot-rolled plates, and seamless tubes by 100 million tons compared to 1988, retaining what should be retained and abandoning what should be abandoned.

In improving product quality, the key is to set high standards and strict requirements. For a long time, China has only assessed the quality of steel enterprise products with the pass rate indicator. This pass rate cannot reflect the actual needs of users or represent international standards. Some products have a pass rate of 99% in the factory, but when delivered to the user, they may not be suitable, and it is even more difficult to sell them in the international market. Under this quality assessment, some enterprises often satisfy themselves with "passable" quality rather than "solid." To change this situation, the Ministry of Metallurgy has decided that in the future, steel enterprises should gradually produce according to international standards, with key enterprises reaching over 40% by 1990.

In saving energy consumption, the key lies in management. Why do the same equipment and blast furnaces have such different energy consumption indicators? There is also a strange phenomenon: the more coal-producing regions have higher energy consumption indicators for steel enterprises. This fully illustrates that subjective factors are the main ones. All loopholes must be plugged, and energy consumption must be greatly saved.

The steel industry has high investment and consumption, but also great potential for savings. If the capital and tax rate is increased by 1%, an additional 7 to 8 billion yuan can be earned annually; if the turnover fund occupation is reduced by 1%, nearly 2 billion yuan can be saved; if the yield rate is increased by 1%, an additional 50 million tons of steel can be produced annually; if the energy consumption is reduced by 1%, it is 80 million tons of standard coal; if the cost is reduced by 1%, 3 billion yuan can be saved. In terms of increasing revenue and saving costs, steel enterprises have a lot to do.

　　钢铁工业劲往哪儿使
    本报记者  刘燮阳
    这些年来，我国钢铁工业有了很大的发展，连续５年年递增３００万吨，钢的年产量已达到５９２２万吨。但是，从去年下半年开始，由于煤电供应不足，运输紧张，钢的产量明显下降，许多铁合金企业开工率只有５０％—６０％。
    进入１９８９年，这种状况不但没有缓和，在一些地区反而有加剧之势。不少大型钢铁企业库煤大量下降，有的已降到临界点以下。今年，国家对钢铁产品要实行最高限价，并新征一些税种，增加某些税费，预计全行业全年减利将达４０—５０亿元。在这种情况下，许多钢铁企业叫苦不迭，感到生产无能为力，事实果真是这样吗？只要看看下面一些数字和事实，就可找到出路。
    ——现在，我国一年生产各种钢材达４７００多万吨，其中大部分都是普通常用的螺纹钢、带钢、盘钢等，当前国民经济急需的板材、管材却十分紧缺，不得不从国外进口。据有关部门统计，从１９８３—１９８７年５年中，进口板、管钢材３４６９万吨，占同期进口钢材总数的４８．３％，相当于同期国内生产板管总量的５２．８％。其中，进口薄板１４７１万吨，等于同期国内薄板产量的８０．５％。近几年来，国际市场板材、管材价格急剧上升，石油管已从每吨４７９美元涨到８４０美元，上涨７５％；冷轧薄板已从每吨２９０美元涨到５５０美元，上涨９０％。因此，努力增产热轧板、冷轧板、镀锌板、镀锡板、硅钢片、中厚板、无缝管等短缺品种，已是当务之急。
    ——近几年来，我国钢铁产品质量虽有所提高，但是“双标率”还不足３０％。就是按国际标准和国外先进标准组织生产的钢材，还不到１／３。它和日本、欧美比较，差距甚大。国内生产的汽车齿轮性能低，质量差，使用寿命比国外的要少一半。在建筑工程上需要的推土机、翻土机、挖掘机，低强度的还能生产，高强度的就需要进口……
    ——钢铁工业是耗能大户，每年耗炼焦精煤约６０００多万吨。现在，一些钢铁企业的耗能指标相当悬殊。好的企业每炼一吨钢只需９００公斤标准煤，而差的则要１３００多公斤。其它技术经济指标相差也很大。
    从以上的事实可以看出，今后钢铁工业要在调整产品结构，提高品种质量，降低能源消耗，挖掘内部潜力上，大下功夫。
    在调整产品结构上，要重点发展板、管等短线钢材，特别是要提高发电、铁路、石油、汽车、轻工等部门用钢的自给率，尽量少用外汇进口钢材。为了适应上述需要，原定老厂改造及利用外资的改建项目，要进行必要的调整。要吸引资金投向，将有限的资金集中投放到保上述急需品种的板管轧机的建设上来。优先安排基础好、投资效益好的老厂改造、扩建，使之能按专业化需求、按规模批量生产高水平的产品。对那些不用国家外汇，企业可以自己以产顶进，自筹外汇和国内配套资金落实的项目更要优先安排。总之，在发展短线产品上，我们再不能犹豫不决，举棋不定了，要通过调整，使冷轧板、热轧板、无缝管等钢材比１９８８年再增加１００万吨，该保的保，该舍的舍。
    在提高产品质量上，关键是要高标准，严要求。长期以来，我国对钢铁企业产品质量的考核只有合格率一个指标，这种合格率既不能反映用户的实际要求，也不能代表国际水平，有些产品合格率，在工厂已达到９９％，可是拿到使用单位并不一定合用，拿到国际市场就更难销出去。在这种质量指标的考核下，一些企业对质量的要求常常满足于“过得去”，而不求“过得硬”。为了改变这种状况，冶金部确定今后钢铁企业要逐步按国际标准组织生产，到１９９０年，重点企业要达到４０％以上。
    在节约能耗上，重要的在于管理。同样的设备，同样的高炉，为什么耗能指标相差如此悬殊？还有一个奇怪的现象，越是产煤多的地区，钢铁企业耗能的指标越高。这就充分说明主观因素是主要的。要堵塞一切漏洞，大力节约能耗。
    钢铁工业投资多，消耗高，节约潜力也大。资金利税率每提高１％，每年可增收７亿—８亿元；流动资金占用每降低１％，就可减少近２亿元；成材率提高１％，每年就增加５０多万吨钢材；能耗下降１％，就是８０多万吨标准煤；成本下降１％，就可节省开支３亿多元。在增收节支上，钢铁企业大有文章可作。
