More than 50 species of fish are now thriving in the lakes and ponds of Qinghai, despite the high altitude and low temperatures. The average elevation of the Qinghai Plateau is over 3,000 meters, with temperatures ranging from -10°C to -20°C. However, various types of fish, including the precious red trout, have been successfully introduced and are breeding and growing.

Qinghai has 266 lakes of various kinds, covering an area of over 18 million mu (approximately 1.2 million hectares), which is more than double the area of cultivated land. The marshy riverbanks and plains concentrated in the upper reaches of the Yellow River and the Huangshui Valley provide 410,000 mu (approximately 27,333 hectares) of suitable land for fish farming. Currently, Qinghai has excavated 3,000 mu of fish ponds. Fishermen in Heyin Town, Guide County, have set a high-altitude freshwater fish farming record, producing 314 kilograms of fresh fish per mu annually. Recently, farmers and fishermen have been releasing carp, bighead carp, and grass carp fry into more than 2,000 mu of new ponds.

　　五十种鱼落户青海
    本报西宁３月８日电  记者郅振璞报道：平均海拔３０００米以上的青海高原，目前是—１０℃至—２０℃的低温，但各类湖泊、鱼塘中人工放养的５０多种鱼却在繁衍生长，珍贵鱼种红鳟鱼也已试养成功。
    青海高原有各类湖泊２６６个，水面积达１８００余万亩，比耕地面积多一倍；集中在黄河上游、湟水谷地的沼泽河滩，有４１万亩适于养鱼。现在，青海已开挖鱼塘３０００亩。贵德县河阴镇渔民创造了每亩年产鲜鱼３１４公斤的高原淡水养鱼纪录。近日来，渔农们正把鲤、鲢、草类鱼苗投放进２０００余亩新池塘。
