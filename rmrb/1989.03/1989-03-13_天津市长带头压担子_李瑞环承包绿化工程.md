Tianjin Mayor Takes the Lead in Shouldering Responsibilities
Li Ruihuan Takes on Greening Project

BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) — On the eve of Arbor Day, Tianjin Mayor Li Ruihuan announced at the city's mass tree-planting mobilization meeting that he would take on the key greening tasks for the inner ring road and 10 radial roads. Vice Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee Liu Jinfen will take on the greening tasks for the outer ring road.

The amount of green space in Tianjin has nearly doubled in the past seven years. However, more than 130 hectares of green space have been lost to garbage dumps, toilets, coal plants, and other facilities. Failure to implement tree-planting plans has also been a common problem. Now, the mayor and others are taking the lead in shouldering the greening responsibilities in earnest.
