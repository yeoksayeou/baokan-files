If you don't arrive half an hour early to secure a seat, you'll have to sit on the floor. This is the experience of a student from the economics department at the University of Freiburg in West Germany. Indeed, higher education in West Germany currently faces numerous challenges, with a lack of classrooms being just one of them. Due to the large number of students, there is a shortage of educational funds, professors, teaching assistants, and teaching equipment.

Classrooms are always packed, with students sitting on windowsills and the floor, and even more students crowded in the corridors outside. Despite this, many students still feel dissatisfied, and professors often have to repeat the same course content two to three times. This has become a common phenomenon in many West German universities.

For example, the University of Frankfurt and the University of Bonn each saw their new student intake double this semester compared to last year. The facilities intended for 40 graduate students at the University of Cologne are now accommodating 200.

In the 1988-1989 academic year, West Germany had 1.47 million university students, a 50% increase from a decade ago. However, the number of professors and teaching assistants in 1987 was approximately 81,500, only a 3.3% increase from 1980.

The root of the problem lies in the government's inadequate planning for education. For instance, in the Frankfurt region, the government initially estimated there would be only 18,000 new university students this year, but in reality, there were 34,000, leading to significant funding issues.

According to the West German constitution, citizens have the right to free higher education, provided they obtain a high school diploma. Only medical and certain natural science majors are admitted through competitive examinations.

Education Minister Möller has requested that the federal government increase the higher education budget from 8 billion marks to 10 billion marks (approximately $5.5 billion) and that local governments provide an equal amount of funding. However, this is still insufficient. He hopes that the federal government's higher education budget can be increased to 13 billion marks, with local governments also increasing their allocations to 13 billion. Some profitable large companies have also taken the initiative to provide economic assistance to the universities they have chosen. Additionally, a 7-year supplementary plan requiring 21 billion marks is under discussion. The additional funds will first be used to address teaching difficulties in law, business management, computer science, and humanities.

　　西德学生上课难
    陈封
    “如果你不提前半小时赶到教室去占位子，那就只好坐在地板上。”这是西德弗雷伯格大学一位经济系学生的话。确实，西德的高等教育目前存在许多困难，缺乏教室只是其中之一。由于学生人数太多，于是教育经费、教授和助教以及教学设备都感不足。
    教室总是挤得满满的，窗台和地上都坐满了人，室外走廊也有许多学生挤着听课。即或如此，不少学生仍有向隅之叹，教授们往往不得不将同一课题的内容另外设法挤时间重讲２遍至３遍。这已成为西德很多大学的普遍现象。
    例如法兰克福的约翰·沃福冈·哥特大学和波恩大学本学期新接纳的新生都比去年增加约一倍。科隆大学供４０名研究生的设备，现在已挤入了２００名研究生。
    在１９８８—１９８９学年，西德共有大学生１４７万，比１０年前增加了５０％，而１９８７年教授和助教的人数约为８．１５万，仅比１９８０年增加了３．３％。
    问题的根本原因是政府在教育计划上考虑不周。例如法兰克福地区，政府原来估计今年只有１．８万名大学新生，而实际上却有３．４万名，因而经费便大成问题。
    按照西德宪法，人民有权免费享受高等教育，但应取得中学毕业证书。只有医学和若干自然科学专业通过考试择优录取。
    教育部长莫勒曼虽已请联邦政府将高等教育预算从８亿马克增至１０亿马克（约合５．５亿美元），并要求地方政府提供同等数量的经费，但仍感不足。他希望联邦政府的高教预算再提到１３亿马克，地方政府也同时将拨款增至１３亿。一些盈利的大公司也主动向所选定的大学提供经济援助。此外还有一个为期７年需款２１亿马克的补充计划正在讨论中。所增加的经费首先用于解决有关法律、商业管理、计算机科学和人文科学方面的教学困难。
