The 23rd session of the Kunming Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee recently featured a "citizen observer" section for the first time.

Ten citizen representatives sat in the observer section and listened to the municipal government officials' report on the city's administrative work to the Standing Committee members of the People's Congress. The agenda for this meeting included topics such as the citywide audit of finances, taxation, and prices, as well as personnel appointments and removals at the municipal level.

Zhang Jiaogui, Deputy Secretary-General of the Kunming Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee, told reporters: "The establishment of the observer system by the Standing Committee is aimed at increasing the transparency of the People's Congress's work, further accepting public supervision, creating conditions for citizens to participate in politics and policy-making, and promoting the development of socialist democratic politics."

Li Guangyi, a representative from the Kunming Individual Laborers' Association, expressed his excitement after observing the meeting: "This is the first time I have attended such a solemn and important meeting. The People's Congress Standing Committee's practice of allowing citizens to observe meetings and disclose administrative activities is very meaningful."

The Kunming Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee also specially invited members of democratic parties to observe the meeting. Wu Jinwei, a member of the China Zhi Gong Party, said that after participating in the observation, he realized that the Standing Committee members' opinions on government departments were quite sharp and indeed represented the wishes of the people.

The Kunming Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee also stipulated that citizen representatives attending the observation do not have voting or speaking rights during the meeting, but they can express their opinions orally or in writing to the office of the Standing Committee after the meeting.

　　政务活动公开　增加决策透明
    昆明人大常委会设市民旁听席
    新华社昆明２月２７日电  （记者周晓频）日前在昆明举行的昆明市人大常委会第二十三次会议首次设立了“旁听席”。
    在旁听席就坐的１０位市民代表倾听了市政府负责人向市人大常委们所作的全市政务工作汇报。这次会议的议题既有全市开展财政、税收、物价大检查的情况，也有市级机关人事任免问题。
    昆明市人大常委会副秘书长张家贵对记者说：“人大常委会建立旁听制度，是为了增加人大工作的透明度，进一步接受群众监督，为公民参政议政创造条件，以推进社会主义民主政治建设。”
    昆明市个体劳动者协会的代表李光义旁听后兴奋地说：“我平生第一次参加这样庄严重要的会议。人大常委会通过让市民旁听会议，以公开政务活动，这是很有意义的。”
    昆明市人大常委会还特别注意邀请民主党派人士旁听会议。致公党委员吴金威说，参加旁听后才知道常委们对政府部门提的意见都十分尖锐，确实代表了群众的心愿。
    昆明市人大常委会还规定，参加旁听的市民代表在会上没有表决权和发言权，但可以在会后口头或书面向市人大常委会办公厅发表意见。
