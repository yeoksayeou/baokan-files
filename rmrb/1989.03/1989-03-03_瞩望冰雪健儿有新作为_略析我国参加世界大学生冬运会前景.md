The 14th Winter Universiade will be held in Bulgaria from March 2 to 12. This is a major winter sports event following the 15th Winter Olympics last year. Chinese athletes will participate in indoor short-track speed skating, figure skating, cross-country skiing, and biathlon.

Chinese athletes have participated in three Winter Universiades, and their overall level is in the middle to lower range. Experts predict that Chinese athletes have the best chance of achieving good results in indoor short-track speed skating. In fact, at the 12th Winter Universiade, China's performance in this event was already notable. Zhang Huanyi finished third in the women's all-around event, and the men's team placed fourth in the 5000-meter relay. Last year, they won the gold medal in the demonstration event at the Winter Olympics. In January of this year, at the indoor short-track speed skating competition in Beijing, 8 individuals and 1 team broke 11 world records in 4 events, forming a group of talented athletes. Now, Chinese athletes in this event have the strength to compete with the world's top athletes.

The International Skating Union approved new rules for figure skating in June last year. By June 1990, major competitions will no longer include compulsory figures. This year's European Championships have already modified the competition rules, with compulsory figures scoring only 20% of the total score. If these rules are implemented in this competition, it will be advantageous for Chinese athletes.

In terms of pair skating and ice dancing, Chinese athletes still lag behind foreign athletes in skating style and musical expression, so it is estimated that their rankings will not be high.

In the women's 5-kilometer cross-country and biathlon events, China is already at the forefront in Asia. Experts estimate that Chinese athletes will achieve good results in this competition.

Chinese athletes' participation in this competition is a rehearsal for the second Asian Winter Games next year and the next Winter Olympics.

    瞩望冰雪健儿有新作为
    ——略析我国参加世界大学生冬运会前景
    第十四届世界大学生冬运会于3月2日至12日在保加利亚举行。这是继去年第十五届冬奥会之后规模较大的一次冬季项目体育盛会。我国选手将参加室内短跑道速滑、花样滑冰、越野滑雪和冬季两项的比赛。
    我国选手已参加过3届世界大学生冬运会，总体水平处于中下游。据专家预测，我国选手最有希望获得好成绩的是室内短跑道速滑。其实我国这个项目在第十二届大学生冬运会就已是出墙的“红杏”。展焕丽获得女子全能第3；男队在5000米接力赛中名列第4。去年取得了冬季奥运会表演项目金牌。今年1月在北京举行的室内短跑道速滑比赛中，共有8人1队11次超4项世界纪录，形成了一个人才群。如今，我国选手在该项目中已具备了和世界强手抗争的实力。
    国际滑联去年6月通过了花样滑冰的新规则。到1990年6月，重大比赛将取消规定动作。今年欧洲锦标赛上，比赛规则已作了修改，规定动作的得分仅占总分的20％。如果这次大赛实行上述规则，将对我国选手有利。
    我国双人滑和冰上舞蹈选手与外国运动员相比无论在滑行风格和音乐表现力诸方面尚有差距，估计名次不会靠前。
    女子5公里越野和冬季两项，我国在亚洲已居前列，行家估计我国选手在这次大赛会取得好成绩。
    我国选手参加此次大赛，是明年第二届亚洲冬运会和下届冬奥会前的一次练兵。　梁学增
