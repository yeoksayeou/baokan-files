	Ascending to New Heights
	--- Congratulations on the Opening of the Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

	Once again, it is the time of year when spring returns to the earth. The second session of the seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference opens today in Beijing. Delegates from all over the country and various sectors will gather to discuss national affairs. We warmly congratulate the opening of this conference!

	In the short span of a year since the first session of the seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, our country's reform, opening-up, and socialist modernization construction have made new developments and achieved new successes. At the same time, we have encountered new difficulties and new problems. The policy of rectification and deepening reform has led our economic life into a period of progress through adjustment, requiring the people of all nationalities in the country to make new efforts. During this year, the work of the People's Political Consultative Conference has also made new progress, playing an important role in implementing the policy of rectification and deepening reform, and making active contributions to realizing national reunification and maintaining world peace. In terms of institutional and organizational construction, we have also achieved gratifying results. The united front organization under the leadership of the Communist Party of China is full of vitality.

	This year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Over the past 40 years, there have been various discussions about the future of the People's Political Consultative Conference. However, the Communist Party of China, the democratic parties, and people of insight from all sides have always believed that the People's Political Consultative Conference is suitable for China's national conditions and should be continuously strengthened and developed, fully utilizing its unique functions that are greatly beneficial to the Chinese nation. As early as when the first plenary session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference exercised the functions of the National People's Congress, Zhou Enlai pointed out: "Even after the convening of the National People's Congress through universal suffrage, the Political Consultative Conference will still play a role in consulting, advising, and promoting the work of the central government." Deng Xiaoping emphasized at the fifth session of the fifth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that the People's Political Consultative Conference has a "bright future and much to do." The 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly pointed out that improving the system of the People's Political Consultative Conference is an important aspect of building socialist democratic politics in the primary stage of socialism. Our Constitution solemnly stipulates: "The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a united front organization with a broad representation. It has played an important historical role in the past and will continue to play an important role in the country's political life, social life, and foreign friendly activities, and in the struggle to build socialist modernization, maintain national unity and solidarity." The experiences of the past 40 years, both positive and negative, have proven that whether the People's Political Consultative Conference is valued or neglected, strengthened or weakened, has a great impact on the stability and prosperity of the country.

	The People's Political Consultative Conference gathers talents from all directions and elites from all sectors, known as a "talent pool" and an "intelligence pool." It has a very broad scope of action and should play a role. As a political organization, it should play a more prominent role in the political field, that is, it should better play the role of "political consultation and democratic supervision." There is still a lot of work to be done in this area. The Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, based on a serious summary of historical experience and extensive solicitation of opinions from relevant parties, formulated the "Provisional Regulations of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on Political Consultation and Democratic Supervision," which made specific provisions on the purpose, main content, main forms, and basic procedures of political consultation and democratic supervision. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches great importance to and strongly supports this regulation, requiring all levels of party committees to follow it. In the future, major national decisions will generally be made through the Political Consultative Conference for political consultation. This is a good and important regulation. This will ensure that democracy is fully exercised and decision-making participation is expanded. If this regulation is implemented seriously rather than perfunctorily, the work of the People's Political Consultative Conference will surely reach a new height.

	Being a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is an honor, but being a member of the Political Consultative Conference is not just an honorable title; it is also a heavy responsibility. Being able to participate in politics and dare to participate in politics, and being good at participating in politics, should be the essential qualities of a member of the Political Consultative Conference. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is not the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and does not have the power to lead; it is not the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and does not have the power to legislate; it is not the State Council and does not have administrative power, but it has the right to supervise the leadership, legislation, and administration, the right to speak, and the right to criticize and make suggestions.

	At present, we face many difficulties and problems in our progress, which is precisely the time when we need people from all walks of life to pool their wisdom, offer advice, and help the country out of difficulties and alleviate the people's worries. We hope that the delegates will better fulfill their responsibilities.

### 跨上新的高度——祝贺全国政协七届二次会议开幕

　　跨上新的高度
    ——祝贺全国政协七届二次会议开幕
    又是春回大地时节。中国人民政治协商会议第七届全国委员会第二次会议今天在北京开幕，来自祖国四面八方、各行各业的政协委员又将齐集一堂，共商国家大事。我们热烈祝贺这次会议的召开！
    从全国政协七届一次会议到现在短短一年时间，我国的改革、开放和社会主义现代化建设事业又有新发展，取得了新成就，同时也遇到新困难和新问题，实行治理整顿、深化改革的方针，使我国的经济生活进入一个在调整中前进的时期，更需要全国各族人民做出新的努力。在这一年中，人民政协的工作也有新的进展，为实现治理整顿、深化改革的方针发挥了重要作用，为实现祖国统一、维护世界和平继续做出了积极的贡献，在政协自身的制度建设和组织建设方面也取得可喜的成果。中国共产党领导下的爱国统一战线组织充满了生机和活力。
    今年是中国人民政治协商会议成立４０周年。４０年来，关于人民政协的前途曾经有过这样那样的议论，但是中国共产党、各民主党派和各方面有识之士始终认为，人民政协适合中国的国情，应当不断巩固发展，充分发挥它大有益于中华民族的独特功能。早在中国人民政协第一届全体会议行使全国人民代表大会职权的时候，周恩来就指出：“就是在普选的全国人民代表大会召开以后，政协会议还将对中央政府的工作起协商、参谋和推动的作用。”邓小平在全国政协五届五次会议上强调，人民政协“前程远大，大有可为”。中国共产党的十三大明确指出，完善人民政协制度是在社会主义初级阶段建设社会主义民主政治的重要方面。我国的宪法更是郑重规定：“中国人民政治协商会议是有广泛代表性的统一战线组织，过去发挥了重要的历史作用，今后在国家政治生活、社会生活和对外友好活动中，在进行社会主义现代化建设、维护国家的统一和团结的斗争中，将进一步发挥它的重要作用。”４０年来正反两方面的经验证明：对人民政协是重视还是忽视，是加强还是削弱，对国家的稳定与繁荣有着极大的影响。
    人民政协揽八方之才俊，集各界之精英，被称为“人才库”、“智力库”，它可以和应当发挥作用的天地是很广阔的。那么作为一个政治组织来讲，它更应当在哪方面发挥更突出的作用呢？显然是在政治方面，也就是应当更好地发挥“政治协商、民主监督”的作用，在这方面还有大量工作可做。全国政协常委会在认真总结历史经验并广泛征求有关方面意见的基础上，制定了《政协全国委员会关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定》，对政治协商和民主监督的目的、主要内容、主要形式和基本程序等作出了具体规定。中共中央极其重视和大力支持这个规定，要求各级党委参照执行。今后，国家重大决策在作出之前一般将通过政协进行政治协商。这是一个很好的、很重要的规定。这就使充分发扬民主，扩大决策参与有了制度保证。认真地而不是敷衍地执行这个规定，人民政协的工作必将跨上一个新的高度。
    作为一名全国政协委员是光荣的，但是政协委员绝不只是一个光荣的头衔，也是一种责任的重托。能够参政议政，敢于参政议政，善于参政议政，应当是政协委员必备的素质。全国政协不是中共中央，没有领导权；不是全国人大常委会，没有立法权；不是国务院，没有行政权，但是它对领导、立法、行政有监督的权利，有说话的权利，有批评、建议的权利。
    当前，我们在前进中遇到的困难和问题很多，正是需要各方人士群策群力，建言献计，为国排难，为民解忧之时。希望与会的委员们更好地担起自己的责任来。
