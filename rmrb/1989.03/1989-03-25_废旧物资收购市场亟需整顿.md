Currently, in some state-owned, collective, and individual waste material purchasing companies, stations, and points in our city, there are serious violations of relevant national regulations. They do not ask about the source of the waste materials and collect whatever they see, becoming an important channel for criminals to dispose of stolen goods.

There are many individual farmers who collect waste materials without a license. For example, Tang Mingrong, a villager from Miaozhuang in Hongwu Township, Ziyang County, uses one license to set up five waste material collection points in the city, illegally collecting 20 copper axles worth over 10,000 yuan at one time. In Sanli Township, Erzhuang, Qizhu Village, there are 17 households of farmers collecting waste materials without a license. Among them, Li Derong, an individual waste material collector, collected 6.4 tons of non-ferrous metals in less than a year. Currently, there are at least 2,000 households in our city collecting waste materials without a license.

Some state-owned and collective units are driven by profit. In October last year, the waste material collection station of the Hongta District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jianyang County was found to have illegally collected over 400 kilograms of aluminum ingots, copper wire, and copper sheets in one instance. The waste material collection station of the Nantai District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Lezhi County illegally collected a large amount of stolen goods from thieves. To evade inspections by public security organs, they hid the illegally collected tin ingots, copper wire, and aluminum wire and then sold them at high prices to township enterprises, reaping huge profits.

Some lawbreakers even cross provinces and counties to form networks for collecting waste materials and then sell them at high prices. An agent from Guangdong illegally collected over 30 tons of non-ferrous metals from Wanxian and then illegally collected 500 kilograms of aluminum sheets in our city's central district before being caught.

It is hoped that relevant departments will cooperate to rectify the market for the purchase of waste materials and not give lawbreakers any opportunity to exploit.

### 废旧物资收购市场亟需整顿

　　废旧物资收购市场亟需整顿
    目前，我市一些国营、集体、个体废旧物品收购公司、站、点，严重违反国家有关规定，不问废品来源，见啥收啥，成为不法分子销赃的重要渠道之一。
    无证收购废品的个体农民多。如资阳县红武乡苗村村民唐明容，用一张执照，在城内私设５个废品收购点，一次就非法收购价值１万多元的铜轴２０个。乐至县三里乡二村七组有１７户农民无证收购废品，其中无证收购废品的个体户李德荣在不到一年时间内，就收购了６．４吨有色金属。现在，我市无证收购废品的至少有２０００户。
    一些国营、集体单位见利忘义。去年１０月，简阳县红塔区供销社废品收购站一次就被查获非法收购的铝锭、铜线和铜瓦等４００多公斤。乐至县南塔区供销社废品收购站非法收购了大量盗窃分子的赃物，为了对付公安机关的检查，他们竟把非法收购的锡锭、铜线、铝线等有色金属藏起来，然后高价卖给乡镇企业，牟取暴利。
    有些不法分子还越省跨县，结网收购废旧物资，然后高价倒卖。广东一采购员从万县非法收购有色金属３０多吨，又到我市中区非法收购铝板５００公斤，后来被抓获。
    希望有关部门通力合作，整顿废旧物资收购市场，不给不法分子以可乘之机。
