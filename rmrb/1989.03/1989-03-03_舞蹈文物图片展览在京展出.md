The China Academy of Art Dance Research Institute held a dance artifact photo exhibition at the Chongwen District Cultural Center in Beijing from March 1st to 3rd.

Chinese dance workers have collected a large number of dance artifacts in the past, but most of them were lost during the Cultural Revolution. This exhibition features a portion of the artifacts they have collected in recent years. Mr. Kenji Seishi, President of the Japanese Dance Association, and Ms. Aya Katsuragi, a modern dancer from Japan, specially came to Beijing to attend the opening ceremony.

One of the exhibits is the Yao ethnic minority's "White Horse Dance."

    舞蹈文物图片展览在京展出
    中国艺术研究院舞蹈研究所于3月1日至3日在北京崇文区文化馆举办舞蹈文物图片展览。
    我国舞蹈工作者过去收集了大量舞蹈文物，“文革”中大部散失。这次展出的是他们近年收集的文物的一部分。日本舞蹈学会会长郡司正胜先生和日本现代舞蹈家葵妖子女士专程来京参加了展览开幕式。
    坳瑶游神舞《白马舞》是展品之一。
