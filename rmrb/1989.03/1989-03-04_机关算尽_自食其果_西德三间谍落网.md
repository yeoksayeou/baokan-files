West German security authorities recently uncovered an international spy network that used computers to steal secrets. Three suspects were arrested in Hanover and West Berlin, and a large amount of evidence was seized. It is reported that this is the first case where "infiltrating" military and research department computers was the main spy activity.

West German Television One reported that the three suspected West Germans were recruited by the Soviet intelligence agency, the KGB, in Hanover in the spring of 1985. Driven by greed for money, they infiltrated important computer networks and databases in the U.S., Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Switzerland, and West Germany at the KGB's direction, stealing secret intelligence. They handed over tens of thousands of highly classified codes, ciphers, and programs to the KGB. Their main targets included the U.S. Los Alamos National Laboratory, the European Nuclear Research Centre in Geneva, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and U.S. military facilities in West Germany, among others.

The head of the West German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution stated that the KGB has been trying to steal secrets from Western databases using various technical means. He believes that Western defensive measures are not stringent enough.

　　机关算尽　自食其果
    西德三间谍落网
    本报波恩３月３日电  记者江建国报道：西德安全机关最近破获了一起通过计算机窃密的国际间谍网，三个涉嫌间谍分别在汉诺威和西柏林被捕，查获了大量证据。据报道，以“入侵”军事、科研部门的计算机为主要间谍活动手段这还是头一宗。
    西德电视一台报道说，这３个涉嫌的西德人是１９８５年春在汉诺威被苏联情报机关克格勃招募的。由于贪图钱财，他们按克格勃指示打入美、日、英、法、意、瑞士及西德的重要计算机网络和数据库，窃取机密情报，先后将上万个高度机密的密码、暗语和程序交给了克格勃。他们的主要目标有美国洛斯阿拉莫斯核研究所、日内瓦欧洲核能研究中心、美国航天局以及美军驻西德军事机关等。
    西德宪法保卫局负责人说，克格勃一直在利用各种可能的技术手段试图从西方的数据库中窃密。他认为，西方的防备措施不够严密。
