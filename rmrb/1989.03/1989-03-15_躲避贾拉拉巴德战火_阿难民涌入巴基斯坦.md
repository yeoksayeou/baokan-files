	Thousands upon thousands of Afghan refugees have been fleeing the besieged eastern city of Jalalabad in recent days, seeking refuge in Pakistan.

	Afghan guerrilla forces in Pakistan said on the 13th that groups of Afghan women, children, and elderly people are streaming towards the Khyber Pass leading to Pakistan. It is estimated that this new wave of refugees numbers around 20,000 to 30,000 people.

	Pakistani officials said that in the past few days, approximately 4,000 Afghan refugees have already arrived at refugee camps around the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar.

	Jalalabad is the third-largest city in Afghanistan, about 70 kilometers from the Pakistani border. Afghan guerrilla forces began a large-scale assault on the city on March 6. According to Kabul government spokesman Nabi Amany, the past seven days have seen the fiercest battles in Jalalabad in a decade. Many buildings in the city have been destroyed, and some residential areas have been reduced to rubble.

	Amany said that government forces are still in control of all defensive positions in Jalalabad, but the guerrillas continue to shell the city with artillery and rockets.

　　躲避贾拉拉巴德战火
    阿难民涌入巴基斯坦
    新华社北京３月１４日电  成千上万的阿富汗难民连日来纷纷逃离激战中的东部城市贾拉拉巴德，进入巴基斯坦境内避难。
    在巴基斯坦的阿富汗游击队人士１３日说，成群结队的阿富汗妇女、儿童以及老人正在涌向通往巴基斯坦开伯尔山口的公路。据估计，这批新涌来的难民大约有二三万人。
    巴基斯坦官方人士说，在过去几天中大约有４０００名阿富汗难民已经抵达巴基斯坦西北部城市白沙瓦周围的难民营。
    贾拉拉巴德是阿富汗第三大城市，距巴基斯坦边界约７０公里。阿富汗游击队３月６日开始对它发动大规模进攻。据喀布尔政府发言人纳比·阿马尼说，在过去７天中贾拉拉巴德发生了１０年来最猛烈的战斗。城内许多建筑物被击毁，有的居民区成为废墟。
    阿马尼说，目前政府军仍然控制着贾拉拉巴德的全部防线，但游击队继续向市区发射炮弹和火箭。
