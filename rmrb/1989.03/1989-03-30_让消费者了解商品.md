The same kangaroo jacket, one comrade spent 25.9 yuan to buy one, while another comrade, with the same fabric and style, bought it in a nearby store and spent 55 yuan.

Someone might say, the pricing is too arbitrary, relevant departments should investigate thoroughly. This is correct. However, if consumers had sufficient product knowledge and were more familiar with the market, the situation might be different.

On a Sunday, the author visited a department store and found two counters selling vacuum cleaners. One counter sold various brands of vacuum cleaners, while the other was an exhibition for "Spring Flower" brand vacuum cleaners. "Spring Flower" had extensive advertising, so customers flocked to it. There were also good brands at the other counter, but unfortunately, people were not clear about the quality differences and it was neglected. The salesperson at the other counter, seeing the crowd at the "Spring Flower" counter, said to me: Customers are like this, actually, some models are not as good as ours!

Why doesn't this counter provide some introductions on the spot?

I believe it is also very necessary to inform consumers about the products and do some advertising on the spot.

　　让消费者了解商品
    同样的袋鼠服，一个同志花了二十五点九元买了一件，而另一个同志，同样质地，同样式样，而且就在隔得不远的商店买的，竟花了五十五元。
    有人可能会说，这价格太没谱了，有关部门该好好查查。这话对。不过，要是消费者有足够的商品知识，比较了解行情，情况可能就不一样了。
    星期天，笔者到一家百货大楼，发现卖吸尘器有两个柜台，一个柜台卖各种吸尘器，一个柜台是“春花牌”吸尘器展销。“春花”广告做得多，于是出现了一边倒：买的人都奔“春花”。这个柜台里也有好牌子的，可惜人们不清楚好坏，受到冷落。柜台里的售货员，看着“春花”柜台前人们的抢购劲，对我说：顾客就是这心理，其实，有的型号还不如这边的好呢！
    这边的柜台为什么不作点介绍呢？
    让消费者了解商品，在现场作些广告，我以为也很有必要。
