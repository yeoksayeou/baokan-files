The natural conditions in Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Qinghai Province are exceptionally favorable, and the region is particularly rich in wildlife resources. Local herdsmen respect traditional customs and rarely hunt, allowing precious animals to thrive and multiply.

With the rising prices of wildlife products and the black market, a group of illegal hunters has emerged, including some units and military personnel. In one hiding place of an illegal hunter in a restricted hunting area, 12 musk deer skins were found. Previously, this area had numerous musk deer, with some gullies containing as many as ten or fifteen, and leopards, deer, and large-horned sheep were commonly seen.

As the prices of wildlife skins, fur, meat, and medicinal products continue to rise, the illegal hunting activities of lawbreakers have become more aggressive and often involve sudden, large-scale operations. They aim to make a quick profit before the government implements effective protection measures. During the hunting season, gunshots echo through the mountains, and some even use machine guns to sweep the area. In one restricted hunting area, 28 traps were set up in a 1,000-meter-long gully. In a bushy area on a mountain where musk deer are abundant, steel wire snares are everywhere, indiscriminately capturing both male and female, young and old (female and young musk deer do not produce musk). Particularly regrettable is that due to the excessive number of traps, hunters themselves cannot keep track of them, and many musk deer, after being caught, become prey for eagles, wolves, and other animals. In areas with lynx and foxes, poachers not only use the aforementioned hunting methods but also spread highly toxic poisons, constantly threatening the lives of humans and livestock.

Even more reprehensible is that in Wulan County's Bayin, Tongpu, and Saishike Townships, illegal deer hunters have repeatedly fired at militia members and herdsmen who tried to stop them. Now, many herdsmen are anxious when herding their livestock. In recent years, hundreds of deer have been killed in these three townships. After years of destructive hunting, many highland wildlife populations have plummeted, with some on the brink of extinction.

These illegal hunters not only possess obsolete rifles but also have brand-new semi-automatic rifles without any markings or codes. Some herdsmen are indignant, saying: "We have never hunted protected animals for many years. Now these lawbreakers dare to hunt animals and even shoot at people, and no one does anything about it. Do they have no law?" We also know that deer antlers, musk, leopard bones, and lynx fur are valuable, but considering that these animals eat the grass on our pastures and our livestock, it is more reasonable for us to hunt for profit. If local people also hunt in large numbers, the consequences would be unimaginable.

We appeal to the relevant departments to take effective measures to stop illegal hunting, rescue endangered precious animals, and ensure the safety of herdsmen's production and lives. At the same time, we appeal to the relevant departments to confiscate and control the spread of illegal firearms in society to prevent them from becoming a social problem.

　　偷猎獐豹　危及人畜
    海西高原野生动物在呼救
    青海省海西蒙古族藏族自治州自然条件得天独厚，野生动物资源尤为丰富。当地牧民尊重传统习俗，很少捕猎，珍贵动物都得到繁衍发展。
    随着野生动物产品的收购和黑市价格暴涨，一批非法捕猎者应“运”而生，其中包括部分单位和部队。在某禁猎区的一个非法狩猎者藏身处发现此人铺的獐子皮就有１２张。以往该区一条沟里獐子多则十几只，少则五六只，草豹、鹿、大头羊到处可见。
    随着野生动物皮、毛、肉和药物类产品的不断涨价，不法分子的狩猎行为更加凶猛，并且带有突击性。想在国家全面采取行之有效的保护措施前捞一把。在狩猎旺季，山上枪声不停，甚至有用机关枪扫射的。在某个禁猎区，有处１０００米左右的山沟，并排埋了２８只架子。一座山上獐子多的灌木丛中布满了钢丝套，不分公母、长幼（母獐和幼獐不产麝香）大肆捕杀。尤其可惜的是，因布放的套子太多，狩猎者自己也记不清，收不回，许多獐子被套死后成了鹰、狼等动物的美餐。有猞猁、狐狸的地方，偷猎者不但用上面提到的惯用狩猎手段，还到处投放烈性毒药，时刻威胁着人畜的生命安全。
    更为恶劣的是在乌兰县巴音、铜普、赛什克等乡非法猎鹿者多次向前去制止的民兵、牧民开枪射击，现在许多牧民放牧时也提心吊胆。近几年在这三乡境内捕杀的鹿不下几百只。经过这几年毁灭性猎杀，许多高原野生动物数量猛降，所剩无几，有的已面临绝种。
    这些非法捕猎者不但持有早已作报废处理的步枪，还持有无任何标记编码的崭新半自动步枪等武器。有些牧民忿忿不平地说：我们多年来从未捕杀禁猎动物，现在这些不法分子胆敢打动物，还开枪打人，都没人管，到底对他们有没有“王法”？我们也知道鹿茸、麝香、豹骨、猞猁皮值钱，就这些动物吃我们草场上的草和牲畜来说，我们捕猎牟利比他们在理儿。如果本地人也大量捕杀的话，那后果不堪想象。
    我们呼吁有关部门采取有效措施制止违法捕猎行为，挽救面临绝种的珍贵动物，保障牧民群众的生产和生命安全。同时呼吁有关部门查禁没收社会流散枪支，及早防止“黑枪”蔓延成为社会问题。
