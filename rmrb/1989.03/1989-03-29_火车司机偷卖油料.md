At Fengshi Yan Station in my county, whenever a freight train stops, one often sees farmers carrying iron buckets and oil cans to the locomotive to "buy" fuel. Some locomotive staff even proactively sell fuel to the farmers.

On December 18th of last year, after the 1014th freight train from Lengshuitan to Hengyang stopped at Fengshi Yan Station, the locomotive staff sold a bucket of 6 kilograms of engine oil to an individual household, collecting 10 yuan in cash.

　　火车司机偷卖油料
    在我县风石堰车站，货车一停，常见一些农民提着铁桶、油壶到机车上“买”油料。有的机车人员还主动向农民兜售油料。
    去年１２月１８日，从冷水滩至衡阳的１０１４次货车在风石堰车站停靠后，机车人员将一桶６公斤机油卖给一家个体户，收取现金１０元。
