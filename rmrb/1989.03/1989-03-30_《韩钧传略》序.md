	Foreword to the Brief Biography of Han Jun

	Just as the victory of the War of Liberation was in sight, Comrade Han Jun unfortunately passed away in his prime at the age of 37. Forty years have passed since then. Last summer, Han Jun's wife, Zhang Guang, and some of his comrades wrote this brief biography to commemorate him and asked me to write a foreword.

	I first met Comrade Han Jun in 1932 at the Caolangzi Prison in Beijing. He was arrested during the "August 1st" demonstration and transferred to Caolangzi Prison. In prison, Han Jun stood firm and, together with other political prisoners, bravely fought against the reactionaries. He also persisted in studying Marxist-Leninist theory, English, and Esperanto. In the harsh prison environment, he progressed from being a member of the Communist Youth League to becoming a member of the Communist Party of China. In the spring of 1935, the "Political Training Department" of Nanjing sent the Third Regiment of the Military Police, disguised as judges and political prisoners, into Caolangzi Prison. They discovered that there was a party branch within the prison, leading to a severe white terror against the prison's party organization. In the spring of 1935, 12 political prisoners, including Han Jun, were sentenced to death. Faced with this life-or-death test, Han Jun and the other 11 comrades remained steadfast and fearless, demonstrating the lofty revolutionary spirit of communists. Later, due to the signing of the "He-Mei Agreement," the Nationalist forces retreated south, and the Third Regiment of the Military Police fled in disarray, allowing these 12 comrades to escape death.

	In October 1936, the party organization rescued over 50 of us from Caolangzi Prison, and Han Jun and I went to work in Shanxi. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Yan Xishan accepted the advice of communists and the new faction in Shanxi to establish the "Youth Anti-Japanese Volunteer Corps." Han Jun was appointed to lead the Second Column. During the first anti-communist wave initiated by the Nationalists, at the end of November 1939, Yan Xishan ordered the Second Column to attack the Japanese forces along the Tongpu Railway, while also ordering the reactionary troops to follow closely behind, intending to crush this anti-Japanese revolutionary force from both sides. Han Jun saw through this plot and refused to execute the order, telegraphing Yan: "When one is away from the capital, orders may not be followed..." Yan then accused the Second Column of being "rebels" and Han Jun of being a "traitor," launching the largest attack in the first anti-communist wave, known as the "December Incident" in history. In this event, Han Jun, with his wisdom and courage, foiled the enemy's plot, defended the revolutionary army, and protected the party's forces. However, he did not discuss the matter with the party organization nor seek approval from higher authorities before sending the telegram in his personal capacity, which gave others a pretext to criticize. This was a result of his impatience and lack of composure. Looking back now, a 27-year-old young commander, facing the enemy's attack, was able to adopt a resolute counterattack strategy. The main aspect of his actions was correct.

	At the end of 1944, the party sent Han Jun to work in Henan. In December 1945, the People's Liberation Army of China formed the Chen-She Army Group, with Han Jun serving as the deputy commander. After the liberation of Beijing, Han Jun served as a member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party, the secretary of the Municipal Committee, and the secretary of the Municipal Military Control Commission. On March 23, 1949, just as the country was about to be founded and Han Jun could have fully displayed his talents to serve the party and the country, he passed away. For 40 years, every time I think of him, I feel deeply regretful.

	Han Jun's life was marked by trials in the courtroom, prison, and battlefield. He was steadfast and sincere, quick-witted and decisive, enthusiastic and efficient, and had great talents in military and political work. He made significant contributions to the party and the revolutionary cause. However, no one is perfect. Han Jun was proud and impulsive, which sometimes led to mistakes in his work. Although Han Jun made various errors, he remains one of our good comrades. On the 40th anniversary of his passing, publishing this small book to express the sorrow of his comrades and future generations is very meaningful.

　　《韩钧传略》序
    正当解放战争胜利前夕，韩钧同志不幸英年早逝，当时他只有３７岁。４０年过去了，去年仲夏，韩钧同志的妻子张光和一些战友撰写了这本传略，以兹缅怀并要我作序。
    我是１９３２年在北平草岚子监狱结识韩钧同志的，他在参加“八一”游行示威时被捕转入草岚子监狱。在狱中，韩钧同志立场坚定，和狱中“政治犯”一起与反动派英勇斗争，并坚持学习马列主义理论，学习英语、世界语。在监狱的艰危环境下他由共青团员，转成为中国共产党党员。１９３５年春天，由于南京“政训处”派宪兵第三团分别伪装成法官和政治犯打入草岚子监狱，发现了狱中有我党支部，使狱中党组织遭受了严重的白色恐怖。１９３５年春，把包括韩钧同志在内的１２名政治犯判处死刑。在这场生死存亡的考验面前，韩钧同志和其他１１名同志毫不动摇，视死如归，表现了共产党人的崇高革命气节。后因“何梅协定”签订，国民党势力南迁，宪兵第三团也仓皇逃遁，这１２位同志才幸免于难。
    １９３６年１０月，党组织把我们５０多名在草岚子监狱的同志营救出狱，韩钧同志和我一起到山西工作。抗战爆发后，阎锡山接受共产党人和山西新派的建议，成立“青年抗敌决死队”，韩钧同志受命担任决死二纵队的领导工作。在国民党挑起的第一次反共高潮中，１９３９年１１月底，阎锡山命令二纵队向同蒲铁路线日军驻地进攻，同时又让顽军紧跟背后，企图与日军两头夹击，一举消灭这支抗日革命力量。韩钧同志识破了这一阴谋。拒绝执行并电告阎：“将在外君命有所不受……”。阎诬二纵队为“叛军”，韩钧为“叛逆”，发动了第一次反共高潮中最大的进攻，即为历史上的“十二月政变”。在这一事件中，韩钧同志以机智和勇敢，粉碎了敌人的阴谋，保卫了革命军队，保卫了党的力量。但他未经党组织讨论，也未向上级组织请示，即以个人名义发电，授人以柄，这是他过于急躁，不够沉着老练之处。现在想来，一位２７岁的年青将领，事急路遥，在敌人的进攻面前能采取坚决反击的方针，主流是正确的。
    １９４４年底，党派韩钧同志去河南开展工作。１９４５年１２月，中国人民解放军陈谢兵团组成，韩钧同志任副司令员。北平解放后，韩钧同志任中共北平市委委员、市委秘书长兼市军管会秘书长。１９４９年３月２３日，正当开国之初，韩钧同志可施展才华更好地为党为国报效之际却与我们长辞了，４０年来，每念及，深为惋惜。
    韩钧同志的一生，历经法庭、监狱和战场的考验，他坚定坦诚，机敏果敢，热情干练，在军事和政治工作方面都很有才能，为党和革命事业做出了贡献。但金无足赤，韩钧同志个性骄傲急躁，也给工作带来过失误。虽然韩钧同志有过这样那样的错误，他仍不失为我们的一位好同志。在他去世４０周年之际，出版这本小册子，寄托战友和后人对他的哀思是很有意义的。
