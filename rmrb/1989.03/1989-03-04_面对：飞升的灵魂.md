The driver who came to pick me up was still a young boy, but he had a serene smile on his face. He tilted his head and said, "We're here." A strand of black hair spread out in the morning light. Later, I pondered what this might signify, because just a few hours later, he died.

He took me to the general manager of the Zhongyuan Oilfield Labor Service Company, Zhao Shuming. He smiled at me. Amidst a cloud of smoke, a group of people were discussing whether the rockery in the courtyard obstructed the driveway or something similar. A slightly plump, quick-moving person stood up and glanced back at the driver. The driver smiled brightly and left.

On the day he passed away, the moonlight was beautiful, and the ascending soul could see the oil derricks swaying in the wind and the moonlight at his mother's window. That night, Zhao Shuming was jovial and charming to the guest who had traveled thousands of miles. Suddenly, someone came in and whispered a few words in his ear. He got up and said he would be right back. Soon, he returned and casually told everyone, "A driver had a bit of an accident." The crowd, tasting the sweet wine, seemed not to have heard this soft whisper. I quietly inquired and found out that the "bit of an accident" was the driver who had brought me here, who had died in a car crash dozens of kilometers away.

At this moment, there was a spark of emotion in Zhao Shuming's eyes, and his efficiency and enthusiasm were wiped away by the driver's death.

Zhao Shuming traveled with me, talking about how he set up the initial enterprise of the Labor Service Company—a bicycle repair shop—in the cold wind, how he rushed to Zhengzhou to buy cheap steel plates and fell ill in the bitter cold and rain, and how he shifted the focus of his operations to the grand industrial enterprise, with annual profits exceeding one billion yuan...

"That day, we were drinking, and the driver got killed?" I asked.

His eyes flickered in the moment of greatest joy: "That person died at that time."

The world is like this; a person's painful soul always flies over the happy living and ascends to heaven. Zhao Shuming lowered his head and fiddled with a cigarette: "We arranged his funeral like that of a martyr and gave his family a large sum of compensation. Of course, this doesn't prove anything, but my heart was truly heavy. That day, every time I picked up my glass, I thought of my past companions who had suffered together..."

A faint face might be a relic of a certain period. That day, when the bad news reached my ears, the black man sitting opposite him, squinting his eyes from the cigarette smoke, was a relic of that period.

In 1967, the wind blew the champion of the big competition, Zhao Shuming, from the Jinan Military Region headquarters back to his unit in Changdao. In his worry, the first thing he saw was a black face squinting mischievously in the sunlight. For some reason, he suddenly felt a sense of brightness. Later, during the sea reclamation, when his legs were injured by a stone, Zhao Shuming's blood gushed out, and it was this black face that came over, muttering, "Platoon leader, platoon leader..."

After an explosion, the black man quickly rushed to the side of the mangled comrade, wailing: "Damn it, damn it." Zhao Shuming pushed him aside, placed his finger under the comrade's nose to feel, and sensed a chill. The black man was still lying on the ground, looking at him sadly.

In those difficult days, what could a sincere heart say? After much thought, he wrote: "Recommend promotion to squad leader."

Zhao Shuming loved reading poetry when he was a student, and poetry could comfort his troubled life. At this time, he wrote many poems, describing himself as a lonely eagle. With this mood, he left the army in the early 1970s. The entire platoon of soldiers cried when they sent him off, and that tear-streaked face was the most vivid mark in the hazy crowd.

After 20 years of hard struggle, just as he was about to live in peace, he saw the "lonely eagle" flying from afar.

He poured a very fine wine into a delicate wine cup, and he picked up seafood and placed it in front of that silent face. At this moment, the young man's soul ascended. Zhao Shuming suddenly tasted the various flavors of life, but he said nothing to his comrade, still maintaining a faint smile.

That comrade returned to his hometown after demobilization and, after many twists and turns, became the party secretary of the township. They had just set up a commune enterprise and urgently needed various raw materials. At Zhao Shuming's place, the black man's squinting eyes showed a cunning expression: "Do you think..."

"As one gets older, even simple things can be savored." Zhao Shuming said as he hurried back to the office after seeing off his comrade.

"A friend comes from afar, and a young man's death coincide, is a taste of life." Zhao Shuming probably didn't hear my words, and walked towards the truck unloading sand on the side of the road. He angrily scolded two drivers. After a burst of anger, Zhao Shuming climbed into the driver's seat, tinkered for a while, and started the engine. As he left, he sternly said something to the drivers, then called out to me in a heavy accent: "Let's go!"

He wouldn't linger long in that "taste," the light smile returned to his thoughtful expression—those who have many things to do are always like this.

　　面对：飞升的灵魂
    沙林
    来接我的司机还是个孩子，但有一脸安详的笑。他头一歪说，到了。一缕黑发在晨光下散开。后来我苦思这征兆着什么，因为十几小时后他就死了。
    他把我送到中原油田劳动服务公司总经理赵树桐那里，冲我笑笑。一片烟雾中，一群人正在讨论院中假山是否挡车道之类的问题。一个微胖的、动作快捷的人站了起来，回头看看司机。司机一脸粲然，点点头走了。
    他离逝的那天月色很好，飞升的灵魂尽可以看到风中沉想的井架和母亲窗前的月光。那一夜，赵树桐谈笑诙谐，对不远千里而来的客人极具魅力；忽然有人进来在他耳边说了几句，他起身说去去就来。不一会，他回来淡淡地对大家说，一个司机出了点事。众人正尝那甜味的酒，似没听见这轻声细语。我悄悄打听，知道那“点事”是那位送我来的司机在几十公里外的地方撞车身亡。
    这时候，赵树桐的眼神中有种感动的火花，他的干练、热情都被这司机的死亡抹掉了。
    赵树桐跟我同行，讲他如何在寒风中搭起了劳动服务公司最初的企业——自行车修理铺的棚子，讲他如何到郑州抢购便宜钢板而在凄风苦雨中堕入病乡，讲他如何把经营的重点转到气魄宏大的工业企业上来，年纯利突破了亿元……
    “那天，我们正喝酒，那个司机给撞死了？”我问。
    他的眼睛在最愉快的一刹那间闪动了一下：“那个人是那个时候死去的。”
    世界就是这样，一个人痛苦的亡灵总是掠过幸福的活人而升入天堂。赵树桐低头捏弄一支烟：“我们像烈士一样安排了他的后事，给了他家人一大笔抚恤金。当然这不足以说明什么，但我的心确实很难过，那天我一端起酒就想起过去一起受苦受难的伙伴……”
    一个依稀的面孔可能是一段岁月的信物。那天噩耗传到耳边，他对面那个被香烟熏得眯起眼睛的黑汉子就是过去一段岁月的信物。
    １９６７年的风把大比武的尖子赵树桐从济南军区机关刮回长岛驻地，他在忧思中首先看到的是一张在阳光下狡黠地眯起眼睛的黑面孔，不知怎的，突然生出了一种豁亮的感觉。后来在围海造田时双腿摔到石头上，赵树桐鲜血直冒，又是这张黑面孔凑了过来，嘴里嘟囔着，连长、连长……
    一次爆破过后，黑汉子飞快扑到血肉模糊的战友身旁，凄厉地喊叫：他娘的，他娘的。赵树桐推他个跟头，把手指放到战友的鼻下试了试，感到一阵冰冷。黑汉子这时还躺在地上，忧伤地望着他。
    在那些艰难的日子，对于一颗诚挚的心，他该说些什么呢？沉思良久，他提笔写道：建议提升排长。
    赵树桐上学时爱读诗，诗绪能慰藉苦闷的生活。这时他写了很多诗。把自己描写成孤独的鹰。他怀着这种情绪７０年代初离开了部队。全连的战士送他时都哭了，而那张泪眼矇眬的面孔是模模糊糊的人群中最鲜明的标志。
    经过２０年的艰苦跋涉，正应恬然处世时，看到远方飘然而至的“孤独的鹰”。
    他把很名贵的酒倒入精致的酒盅里，他把海鲜夹到那张默默无语的面孔前，就在这个时刻，那个年轻者的灵魂飞升了。赵树桐一下体味到人生的诸多滋味，但对战友什么也没有说，依然荡着淡淡的笑意。
    那位战友复员回乡，经过不少曲折后当上了乡党支部书记。他们新办社队企业，急需各种原材料。在赵树桐这里，黑壮汉眯着的眼睛露出狡黠的神态：“您看是不是……”赵树桐忙着同别人交谈，没太在意就在他们的需求单上签了字。
    “人到老年，简单的事情也能嚼出些味道。”赵树桐送走战友匆匆赶回办公室时说了这么一句。
    “有朋自远方来和一个年轻人死去碰在一起就是一种人生滋味。”赵树桐大概没听见我的话，朝路边正卸沙石的卡车走去。他怒气冲冲地斥责两个司机。一阵暴怒过后，赵树桐钻进驾驶室，鼓捣一会，弄着了发动机。走时，他很威严地对司机们说了句什么，然后乡音很重地对我喊道：走嘿！
    他不会长久沉湎在那种“味道”中的，那轻捷的笑又换上了沉思——有许多事情要做的人总是这样。
