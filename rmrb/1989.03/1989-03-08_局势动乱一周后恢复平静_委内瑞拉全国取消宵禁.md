    新华社加拉加斯３月７日电  （记者胡积康、方长平）经过一周的动乱，委内瑞拉的紧张局势渐渐缓和下来，首都加拉加斯已恢复了往日的平静。
    昨天，加拉加斯绝大部分超级市场、商店、银行和企事业单位开始营业或办公，人们纷纷回到各自的工作岗位。公共交通基本恢复正常，小学也全部复课，食品和基本生活用品的供应已经正常。但是，各主要街道和居民区仍然有军队和警察巡逻，超级市场门前仍有购物长龙。到昨天为止，绝大部分州取消了宵禁。据悉，如无新情况，近日内加拉加斯的宵禁也可望解除。
    新华社加拉加斯３月６日电　委内瑞拉国防部长伊塔洛·德尔瓦列６日在加拉加斯宣布，从今天起，取消在全国实行的宵禁。
    据国防部发表的公报说，鉴于委内瑞拉全国形势已经恢复正常，根据佩雷斯总统的指示作出了上述决定。公报还宣布，从３月７日上午起恢复正常工作时间。
    委内瑞拉政府是在首都加拉加斯和其它重要城市发生流血骚乱后于２月２８日在全国实行宵禁的。在３天的骚乱中，约有２５０人死亡、１８００人受伤。
