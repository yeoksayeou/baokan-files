The first session of the Soviet People's Congress is scheduled to be held in mid-April. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) has selected 100 representatives who will attend the congress on behalf of the CPSU.

The Central Committee plenary session, which opened this morning, elected 100 people's representatives. Among them are CPSU leaders such as Gorbachev and Ryzhkov, as well as other party workers. Additionally, there are 47 representatives from the production sector and 22 notable figures from the fields of education, science, and culture.

In January, the CPSU Central Committee plenary session approved a list of 100 candidate representatives. This list was compiled after more than 100,000 grassroots party organizations nominated candidates, and after city, district, regional, and republic party organizations selected and recommended them. The Political Bureau then submitted the list to the Central Committee for approval.

A total of 750 representatives, selected by social organizations including the CPSU, will attend the first session of the People's Congress. These representatives make up one-third of the total 2,250 representatives. This is the first time in Soviet history that representatives have been selected in this manner. Previously, Soviet representatives were only elected in various regions and ethnic regions.

Koptuyg, Chairman of the CPSU People's Representatives Election Committee and Deputy Director of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, spoke at the Central Committee plenary session. He pointed out that the CPSU's call for this election demonstrates that the CPSU is indeed the vanguard and leading force of society. The CPSU's candidates emphasized the need to enhance the CPSU's status as the political vanguard of the Soviet people and to firmly implement the party's line in the highest legislative body of the state during their meetings with the public.

In the afternoon, the CPSU Central Committee plenary session moved on to its second agenda item, discussing the tasks of implementing the CPSU's agricultural policy under modern conditions. The plenary session will conclude tomorrow.

　　首届苏联人民代表大会四月中旬举行
    苏共中央全会选出百名代表
    新华社莫斯科３月１５日电  于今天上午开幕的苏共中央全会选出了１００名人民代表，他们将代表苏联共产党出席在４月中旬召开的首届苏联人民代表大会。
    在当选的人民代表中，有戈尔巴乔夫、雷日科夫等苏共领导人和其他党的工作者，还有４７名生产领域的工作人员，及２２名教、科、文等方面的知名人士。
    今年１月召开的苏共中央全会上通过了１００名代表候选人的名单。这是经过１０万多个基层党组织提名，市、区、州和加盟共和国党组织挑选推荐后，才由政治局提交中央全会通过的。
    由包括苏共在内的社会组织选出的人民代表共７５０名，占全代表总数２２５０名的１／３，将出席首届人民代表大会，这在苏联是第一次。过去的苏维埃人民代表只是在各地区和民族地区选出。
    苏共人民代表选举委员会主席、苏联科学院副院长科普秋格在中央全会上发言指出，苏共就这次人民代表选举向全党和全民发出的呼吁书表明，苏联共产党确实是社会的先锋队和领导力量。苏共提出的候选人在与公众会见时都强调了提高苏共作为苏联人民政治先锋队的威信和在国家最高立法权力机构中坚定地执行党的路线的必要性。
    当天下午苏共中央全会转入第二个议题，讨论在现代条件下实现苏共农业政策的任务。全会将在明天结束。
