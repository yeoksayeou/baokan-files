The unique scenery in Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong Gorge in Sichuan Province resembles underground karst caves. Professor Zhang Linshui from Lanzhou University, after conducting research, believes that the unique scenery in Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong Gorge was gradually formed under the action of glaciers during the Quaternary period.

Professor Zhang Linshui discovered a perfectly shaped sheep-back rock on the shore of Longhai Lake during his visit to Jiuzhaigou last year. This rock, which is rare in glacial valley landscapes, is approximately 60 meters long, 30 meters wide, and 12 meters high. To the north of the sheep-back rock, there is an ancient stone circle that has long ceased to be active. The outer ring of the stone circle is composed of large stones, while the inner ring is composed of small stones, which is quite different from the typical stone circles that mainly consist of fine soil in the middle. In the lower reaches of Longhai Lake, there are several glacial moraine hills scattered at the bottom of the seasonal lakes, Shangjiehai and Xiajiehai. The lake embankment of Longhai Lake is also a glacial cliff. The rock face on the lake side of the cliff has a polished surface and glacial scratches formed by glacial erosion. Professor Zhang Linshui said that based on these traces, it can be determined that a large glacier developed here about 10,000 years ago, with its end extending to an altitude of around 2,400 meters near Jinghai. After the glacier retreated, there was a period of dry and cold climate conducive to the development of permafrost.

In his investigation of the nearby Huanglong Gorge scenic area, Zhang Linshui discovered that Huanglong Gorge is also a valley that has been transformed by glacial action.

    九寨沟奇特景观原是冰川形成
    新华社兰州电　（记者陈惠明）四川省九寨沟和黄龙沟风景区出现奇特景观，酷似地下溶洞，兰州大学张林源教授经研究认为，九寨沟和黄龙沟的奇特景观是在第四纪冰川作用下逐渐形成的。
    张林源教授去年到九寨沟考察时，在长海湖边发现一个在山谷冰川地貌中罕见的形态完美的羊背岩，这个羊背岩长约60米，宽30米，高12米。在羊背岩北侧有一个早已停止活动的古石环，石环外围是大石块，中间是小石块，与一般中间主要由细土构成的石环迥然不同。在长海湖下游的上季节海和下季节海湖底，散布着不少冰碛小丘陵。长海湖湖堤也是一冰蚀陡坎，陡坎临湖一侧的岩面上有冰川磨蚀形成的磨光面和冰川流动的擦痕。张林源教授说，根据这些遗迹可以判定，在距今一万年前，这里发育过大冰川，其末端下伸到海拔2400米左右的镜海附近。在冰川退缩后，这里还存在过一段有利于多年冻土发育的干冷气候期。
    张林源在对邻近的黄龙沟风景区的考察中发现，黄龙沟也是一条受到冰川作用改造过的沟谷。
