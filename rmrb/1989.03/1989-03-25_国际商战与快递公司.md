To cope with the rapidly changing international market situation, many large companies in Europe have established product warehouses at specific air freight bases. Each air freight base is equipped with highly efficient courier companies. For example, at the Cologne Airport in West Germany, there is a courier company operated by Australians.

Every night after midnight, the Cologne Airport is bustling with activity, with hundreds of tons of goods being sorted and packed into containers ready to be loaded onto the first flight at dawn. Items as large as a car or as small as a few machine parts can be handled this way. The advantage is that the manufacturer does not need to store spare parts at the production site, thus saving warehouse costs. For instance, if a car factory urgently needs a certain type of cylinder, a telegram can summon it immediately.

An interesting example is: A fashion company in Paris designed a set of the latest trendy women's clothing, but they couldn't find buttons of the right color locally. To get a few buttons for the sample, the fashion company was willing to pay thousands of times the cost of the buttons themselves in freight to have a button company in Cologne Airport send the specified buttons to Paris. Since fashion styles change rapidly, the style is the key to determining the price, and production costs account for only a tiny fraction of the price. If a new style of clothing hits the market and becomes a sensation, attracting millions of men and women to rush to buy it, the high freight cost for the first button sewn on the sample and the high profits the fashion company will make later are negligible in comparison.

This example may illustrate how participants in international business competition are constantly thinking of ways to be the first to seize opportunities.

　　国际商战与快递公司
    为应付瞬息万变的国际市场形势，欧洲许多大公司都在特定的空运基地建立了产品仓库，每个空运基地都设有效率很高的航运快递公司。例如，在西德的科隆航空港，就有一家澳大利亚人经营的快递公司。
    每天午夜以后，科隆机场正是灯火通明工作忙碌的时候，数百吨货物都被分门别类装入集装箱准备凌晨由第一班飞机运往各地。大到一辆汽车，小至几个机器零部件都可如此办理。其优点是制造厂家不必在生产地点储存备用材料，从而可以节省仓库费用。如某汽车工厂急需某种型号的汽缸，一封电报，招之即来。
    一个有趣的例子是：巴黎一家时装公司设计了一套最新潮的女装，就地找不到合适色调的纽扣。为了样装上的一两粒纽扣，时装公司也不惜破费比纽扣本身价格高几千倍的运费，要求驻科隆机场某纽扣公司将指定规格的纽扣快递到巴黎。因时装式样变化极快，式样是决定售价的关键，生产成本只占货价极小部分，如果新式样服装一出台便走红，吸引千千万万男女争相抢购，那缝在样品上第一粒纽扣的昂贵快递运费和服装商以后所得的高额利润相比，实在微不足道。
    这个事例，也许可以说明国际商战的参加者们是如何千方百计为“捷足先得”动脑筋了。
