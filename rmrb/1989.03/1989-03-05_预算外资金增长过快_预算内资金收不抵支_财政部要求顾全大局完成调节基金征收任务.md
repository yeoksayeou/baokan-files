Title: Budgetary Extraneous Funds Grow Too Rapidly, Budgetary Funds Fall Short

	Budgetary extraneous funds in 1988 are estimated to reach 22.7 billion yuan, an increase of 19.23 billion yuan compared to 1978. The annual growth rate has been around 2 billion yuan.

	In recent years, the growth of budgetary funds has slowed down, resulting in a deficit each year, which is in stark contrast to the rapid growth of budgetary extraneous funds. Meanwhile, due to the excessive decentralization of financial resources, the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income has been declining year by year, from 37.2% in 1978 to 19.3% in 1988. The fiscal resources within the national budget are severely insufficient, weakening the macro-control over the economy.

	Recently, the State Council decided to collect national budget adjustment funds, concentrating some financial resources from the budgetary extraneous funds to create conditions for the smooth progress of reform and construction. This will also help to reasonably guide the flow of budgetary extraneous funds, tighten general expenditures, strengthen key areas, reduce total social demand, and control blind construction and consumption expansion. However, due to the overall tightness of funds, there are certain difficulties in levying the adjustment fund, and the task is arduous. The Ministry of Finance requires all regions and departments to consider the overall situation and complete the collection of the adjustment fund for this year in a timely and full manner.

　　预算外资金增长过快  预算内资金收不抵支
    财政部要求顾全大局完成调节基金征收任务
    本报北京３月４日讯  记者王锦鹄从今日在这里召开的全国征集国家预算调节基金工作会议获悉：我国预算外资金１９８８年预计可达２２７０亿元，比１９７８年增加１９２３亿元，每年增长的数额都在２００亿元左右。
    近几年我国预算内资金增长缓慢，收不抵支，连年出现财政赤字，与预算外资金大幅度增长形成鲜明对照。同时，由于财力过于分散，财政收入占国民收入的比重连年下降，由１９７８年的３７．２％下降到１９８８年的１９．３％，国家预算内财力严重不足，削弱了对经济的宏观调控能力。
    最近，国务院决定征集国家预算调节资金，从预算外资金中集中一部分财力，为改革和建设的顺利进行创造条件，也有利于合理引导预算外资金流向，紧缩一般，加强重点，压缩社会总需求，控制盲目建设和消费膨胀。但由于总的资金紧张，开征调节基金有一定难度，任务艰巨。财政部要求各地区、各部门顾全大局，及时足额地完成今年调节基金的征收任务。
