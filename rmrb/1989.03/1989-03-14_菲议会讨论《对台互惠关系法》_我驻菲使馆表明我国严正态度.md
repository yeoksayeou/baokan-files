The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Philippines issued a statement today in Manila saying that China will not accept the "Mutually Beneficial Relations with Taiwan Act" currently being considered by the East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee of the Philippine House of Representatives.

A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy stated in a declaration that the essence of this bill is to treat Taiwan as a "state," engaging in official or quasi-official exchanges, thereby upgrading the existing relationship between the Philippines and Taiwan.

The statement emphasized that this bill violates the principles established in the Sino-Philippine Joint Communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations and also contravenes Administrative Order No. 313 issued by President Corazon Aquino.

The statement said, "We hope that the few legislators who proposed this bill will consider the broader interests of Sino-Philippine friendship, withdraw the draft of the 'Mutually Beneficial Relations with Taiwan Act,' and refrain from actions that harm the feelings of the Chinese people and impede the fundamental interests of the Filipino people."

The East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee of the Philippine House of Representatives agreed to discuss the draft of the "Mutually Beneficial Relations with Taiwan Act" on March 9.

In the March 10 press release, Philippine Foreign Ministry spokesperson Felipe Mabillangan said that the Foreign Ministry opposes this bill because it is inconsistent with the Philippine government's "one China" policy and poses a threat to the good relations between the Philippines and China.

Philippine Foreign Minister Raul Mangalup said on March 13 in a statement to the press, "We maintain our position of not supporting the 'Mutually Beneficial Relations with Taiwan Act.'" He said, "There is no need to enact a law on relations with Taiwan to successfully implement our policy of recognizing Beijing as the government of all China. We support strengthening people-to-people relations between Taiwan and the Philippines."

　　菲议会讨论《对台互惠关系法》
    我驻菲使馆表明我国严正态度
    新华社马尼拉３月１３日电  中华人民共和国驻菲律宾大使馆今天在这里发表声明说，中国决不接受菲律宾众议院东盟和亚太小组委员会正在拟议中的《对台互惠关系法》。
    中国大使馆发言人在一项声明中说，这个法案的实质是将台湾当作“国家”看待，同台湾保持官方或官方性质的往来，以使菲律宾同台湾之间现存的关系升级。
    声明强调说，这个法案违背了中菲建交联合公报所确定的原则，也违反了科·阿基诺总统颁发的３１３号行政命令。
    声明说，我们希望提出这个法案的少数议员以中菲友谊的大局为重，撤回《对台互惠关系法》草案，不要做伤害中国人民感情和妨碍菲律宾人民基本利益的事情。
    菲律宾众议院东盟和亚太小组委员会是３月９日同意讨论《对台互惠关系法》草案的。
    在３月１０日的新闻公报中，菲外交部发言人弗莉佩·马比兰甘说，菲外交部反对这一法案，因为这一法案与菲政府坚持的“一个中国”的政策不一致，将构成对菲中两国良好关系的威胁。
    菲律宾外交部长劳尔·曼格拉普斯１３日也向新闻界发表声明说，“我们坚持不赞成《对台互惠关系法》的立场”。他说，“为了推行我们承认北京作为全中国政府的成功政策，没有必要制订对台关系法。我们赞成加强同台湾之间人民对人民的关系”。
