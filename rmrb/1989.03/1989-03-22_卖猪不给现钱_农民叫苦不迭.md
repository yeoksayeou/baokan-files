On February 2nd, I passed through Jinping Township in Jiange County, Sichuan Province, and found that some farmers, after selling their pigs, did not receive cash but instead received a time deposit or savings account passbook. At the Jinping Township Food Station, which is responsible for purchasing live pigs, many farmers were gathered to collect their pig-sale payments. Some had already come more than ten times. However, they waited from morning till night without receiving any money and had to leave disappointed.

It is understood that since November 1988, this food station has not paid cash to farmers for purchasing live pigs. Donghe Village resident Guo Weichang sold two pigs in November last year and should have received 558 yuan. He went to the food station more than ten times and only in early January this year did he receive 50 yuan in cash and a time deposit passbook. Qingcheng Village residents Zhong Yuan'an and Zhong Shuwu, father and son, sold four pigs and should have received 1010 yuan, but they have not received a single cent. It is hoped that relevant departments will urgently address this problem.

　　卖猪不给现钱        
    农民叫苦不迭
    ２月２日，我路过我省剑阁县锦屏乡，发现一些农民卖了猪，却得不到现金，只能得到１张定期或活期存单。在收购生猪的锦屏乡食品站门口，围着许多来领取卖猪款的农民。有的人已经来过１０多次了。可是，他们从早等到天黑也领不到钱，不得不失望而归。
    据了解，自１９８８年１１月以来，这个食品站收购生猪就没有现金付给农民。灯河村苟维长去年１１月卖了两头猪，应得５５８元。他到食品站去了１０多次，直到今年１月上旬才领到５０元现金和一张定期存单。青城村仲元安、仲树武父子卖了４头猪，应得１０１０元，但未领到一分钱。希望有关部门抓紧解决这一问题。
