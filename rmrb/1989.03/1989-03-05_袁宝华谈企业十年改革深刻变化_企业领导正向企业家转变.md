The transition of enterprise management in China from a closed system to an open one marks a significant turning point in the history of enterprise management.

Yuan Baohua, the president of the China Enterprise Management Association, stated at a report meeting commemorating the 10th anniversary of the association's establishment that Chinese enterprise management is breaking free from the constraints of the old system under the conditions of a product economy. An enterprise operation mechanism characterized by interest-driven and risk-pressure is taking shape. Enterprise personnel generally believe that the transformation of enterprise leaders from administrative roles to entrepreneurs is an irreversible trend, although currently, only a small portion of factory directors (managers) can be considered entrepreneurs. At the same time, the establishment of the factory director responsibility system has strengthened the unified leadership of enterprise production and operations.

Another notable feature of the profound changes in enterprise management is the shift in management focus from emphasizing material resources to "people-centered" approaches. How to attract, cultivate, and utilize talent has become a decisive factor in whether an enterprise can succeed in competition.

Of course, there are still many issues in enterprise management. Yuan Baohua's view is that it is necessary to pay attention to the continuity and relative stability of policies and to emphasize internal enterprise management. It is essential to adhere to the direction of developing public ownership as the mainstay.

　　袁宝华谈企业十年改革深刻变化
    企业领导正向企业家转变
    本报北京３月４日讯  记者江绍高报道：我国企业管理由封闭式转向开放式，这是企业管理史上的一个重大转折。
    中国企业管理协会会长袁宝华昨天在纪念该会成立１０周年报告会上说，中国企业管理正在摆脱产品经济条件下旧体制的束缚，以利益驱动、风险压力为特点的企业经营机制正在形成。企业界人士普遍认为，企业领导者由行政型向企业家转变，已经是一个不可逆转的趋势，尽管目前称得上企业家的还只是厂长（经理）中的一小部分。同时，厂长负责制这一新的领导体制的确立，强化了企业生产经营的统一领导。
    企业管理深刻变化的另一个特点，是管理的重点从着重对物到“以人为中心”，如何聚集人才、培养人才、使用人才，已经成为企业能否在竞争中获胜的决定性因素。
    当然，企业管理工作还存在着不少问题。袁宝华的观点是，必须注意政策的连续性和相对稳定性，重视企业内部管理。必须坚持公有制为主体的发展方向。
