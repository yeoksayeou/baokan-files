Title: The Yuncheng Gold Mine Problem Has Been Exposed for a Long Time, Why Has It Not Been Addressed Yet?

Dear Editor,

    I read the article "How Can the Yuncheng Gold Mine Operate Without Reform?" (see the January 8th issue of People's Daily, page 1, reporter's letter), and while I wouldn't say it was shocking, I must echo the sentiment: how can this be allowed to continue?

    A gold mine funded by the state should be managed with the utmost rigor. However, under the leadership of Yuncheng's Deputy Mayor Yang Tianzhen, this gold mine has become a den of lawlessness and disorder.

    The mined ore, based on its gold content, should yield at least 100 kilograms of gold, but in reality, less than 3 kilograms have been handed over to the state, with over 97 kilograms gone missing; not only gone missing, but the first batch of gold produced by the mine was reportedly taken by Yang Tianzhen for "propaganda" purposes. His nephew, Wang Jiaomu, who is responsible for the mine, has repeatedly sold mined ore illegally, but after being exposed, nothing came of it.

    Even more baffling is that despite the numerous problems exposed in the gold mine, when someone from the Yuncheng Municipal Economic Commission reported these issues to their superiors, not only were the problems not resolved, but the person who reported them was instead reprimanded.

    Reading this, one cannot help but ask: what kind of world is it in Yuncheng now? How can someone like Yang Tianzhen, who is not even a high-ranking official, cover up so much? Considering the fact that the gold Yang took for "propaganda" has still not been accounted for, one has reason to suspect: are there accomplices around Yang Tianzhen, or perhaps even powerful backers supporting him?

    The newspaper exposed this matter over two months ago, and yet there has been no follow-up. I hope that the People's Daily reporter will continue to speak out, and I also hope that the party and government departments in Yuncheng will take action on this matter and give an account to the readers.

### 运城金矿问题揭露多时  为何至今还未作出处理

　　运城金矿问题揭露多时
    为何至今还未作出处理编辑同志：
    读《运城金矿不整顿怎么得了？》（见元月８日人民日报头版记者来信），不敢说触目惊心，也要跟着说一句怎么得了！
    国家投资开采的金矿，理应有极为严格的管理。可这个运城副市长杨天桢领导下的金矿，却成了违法乱纪的“洞穴”。
    矿山已开采的矿石，按含金量计，少说也能出黄金１００公斤以上，可实际只上交国家不足３公斤，有９７公斤多流失了；岂止是流失，金矿第一批生产出来的黄金被杨天桢拿走，据说是用作“宣传”了。杨的表弟王甲木身为金矿负责人，多次盗卖矿石，被揭发后却不了了之。
    更令人纳闷的是，金矿暴露出这么多问题，运城市经委有人向领导报告，问题不但得不到解决，反映人反而受到打击。
    读到此，不禁要问：如今运城那里是什么世道？杨天桢这样一个算不得“高官”的人，何以能一手遮天？联系到被杨拿走用作“宣传”的黄金至今无下落这一事实，人们有理由怀疑：杨天桢周围是否还有同流合污者，抑或还有为其撑腰的后台人物？！
    报纸披露此事已有两个多月了，至今未见有下文，但愿人民日报记者继续仗义执言，也但愿运城的党政部门在此事的查处工作上有所作为，并向读者有个交代。
