Early March in the outer regions of Hohhot is still a frozen land, with biting cold. At Hohhot Railway Station, migrant workers from various places gather in groups around their luggage, shivering in the cold wind. The influx of migrant workers from Guangdong, Hainan, Beijing, and other places has also appeared here.

According to railway station staff, this year's migrant worker movement started earlier than in previous years, overlapping with the spring migration. The railway station staff are extremely busy.

This year's migrant worker flow is different from previous years; it is not one-way but bidirectional. One flow is the influx of people. Many migrant workers from other places come with the hope of making money, seeking various opportunities, but ultimately find nothing. After sighing in disappointment, they embark on their return journey, thus forming the outflow of people.

Today, the reporter counted at the ticket gate that approximately 200 migrant workers got off the 296th train; around 230 migrant workers boarded the 154th train to Changzhou at noon. Estimating for the whole day, the inflow and outflow are roughly equal, around 1,500 people. The reporter interviewed several migrant workers. A group of Jiangsu migrant workers who had just gotten off the train confidently said, "I have been working in Inner Mongolia for 4 years, I have connections, finding work won't be a problem." The migrant workers standing nearby, preparing to board the train, laughed, "Wish you luck, our connections are no good, it's up to you now." I heard them speaking their local dialect and curiously struck up a conversation. It turned out they were migrant workers from Zhuozi County, very close to Hohhot. In previous years, they could find work in Hohhot, but not this year. They had to go far away. I asked them where they planned to go. They countered, "Where is there work?" I said that this year, basic construction projects nationwide are being scaled back, so work is scarce everywhere. They were a bit skeptical, "People in the city live so densely, don't they need to build more houses?"

Today, the reporter also visited several large construction companies in Inner Mongolia that have traditionally employed many migrant workers. The relevant person in charge said: After the Spring Festival, more and more migrant workers are looking for work. In reality, our own workforce is not even fully employed, and we have to go to other places to bid for projects! He hopes the newspaper can convey a message to migrant workers nationwide: The labor market in Inner Mongolia is already saturated, so please do not come here anymore.

### 呼市火车站的双向流动

　　呼市火车站的双向流动
    本报记者  傲腾
    ３月初的塞外呼和浩特仍是冰封大地，寒气袭人。在呼和浩特火车站，来自各地的民工三五成群围着行李堆，在寒风里哆嗦。广东、海南、北京等地来势汹汹的“民工潮”，在这里也出现了。
    据火车站工作人员讲，今年的民工流动早于往年，与春运接上了。火车站的工作人员忙得不亦乐乎。
    今年的民工流向不同于往年，不是单向，而是双向。一个是流入的人潮。外地很多民工抱着外出发财的希望远道而来，遍寻各种门路，最后还是一无所获。在发出失望的叹息之后，他们踏上归途，于是又形成了流出的人潮。
    记者今天在检票口数了一下，从２９６次列车下车的民工大约２００人；中午上开往常州的１５４次列车的民工也大约２３０人。全天估算，流入流出者大体相当，１５００人左右。记者访问了几位民工。十几个刚下火车的江苏民工领头满有把握地说：“我已在内蒙古干了４年，我有关系，找活儿没问题。”旁边扎堆站着准备上车的民工听到了，嘲笑道：“祝你走运，我们的关系不行了，看你的了。”我听他们说当地话，好奇地与他们搭腔，原来他们是离呼和浩特很近的卓资县民工，往年能在呼和浩特找到活儿，今年不行了。只好远走他乡。我问他们打算去哪儿？他们反问我，“哪儿有活儿？”我说今年全国压缩基本建设，哪儿都一样，活儿少。他们有点不信，“城里人住得那么紧，不盖楼住？”
    今天，记者还访问了内蒙古以往用民工较多的几大建筑公司，有关负责人讲：春节以后求活儿的民工越来越多，实际上我们自己的队伍还吃不饱，要到外地投标找活儿干呢！他希望报纸向全国各地民工传个信儿：内蒙古劳务市场已饱满，不要再往这里流动了。
