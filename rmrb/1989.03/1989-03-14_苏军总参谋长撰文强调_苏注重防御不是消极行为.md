Soviet Chief of the General Staff Moiseyev today published an article in *Pravda* emphasizing, "The defensive nature of Soviet military doctrine does not lower but rather raises the requirements for military preparedness," and "We have sufficient capability and determination not to allow anyone to dictate to us from a position of strength."

Moiseyev took over as the Soviet Chief of the General Staff in December last year, replacing Akhromeyev.

In his article titled "The Defensive Orientation of the Soviet Military Doctrine: Its Implementation," he criticized the U.S. Secretary of Defense's budget report for advocating "imposing great pressure on the Soviet Union," aiming to "exhaust the Soviet Union in the vicious cycle of the arms race and confrontation."

He pointed out that although the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as the Warsaw Pact and NATO, "firmly deny that the threat of war comes from them," officials from the United States and NATO frequently claim that "the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries are their military enemies."

This Soviet military leader emphasized, "We are prepared to give our armed forces new qualities," and "to rationally organize scientific research and shorten the time for applying scientific conclusions to military practice."

Moiseyev stressed that the Soviet Union prioritizes defense in strategic, operational, and tactical training of its armed forces, which is not a "passive act" nor does it mean "completely handing over the initiative to the aggressor."

It is noted that this important article by the Soviet Chief of the General Staff Moiseyev was published shortly after the start of the negotiations on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe in Vienna, and while the decision by the Warsaw Pact countries to unilaterally reduce their military forces has not yet received a positive response from NATO countries.

### 苏军总参谋长撰文强调  苏注重防御不是消极行为

　　苏军总参谋长撰文强调
    苏注重防御不是消极行为
    新华社莫斯科３月１３日电  苏军总参谋长莫伊谢耶夫今天在《真理报》上撰文强调：“苏联军事学说的防御性不是降低，而是更加提高对军队战备的要求”，“我们有足够的可能和决心不允许任何人从实力出发来同我们谈话。”
    莫伊谢耶夫于去年１２月接替阿赫罗梅耶夫就任苏军总参谋长。
    他在题为《苏联的军事学说：实现其防御方向》的文章中指责美国国防部长在军费预算报告中宣扬“对苏联施加强大压力”，“要使苏联在军备竞赛和对抗的恶性循环中精疲力竭”。
    他指出，虽然苏联和美国，以及华约和北约，都“坚决否认战争威胁来自它们”，但美国和北约的官方代表经常宣称“苏联和其它华约国是它们的军事敌人”。
    这位苏联军方领导人强调说：“我们准备使自己的武装力量具有新的质量”，“合理组织科研工作，缩减把科学结论运用于军事实践的时间”。
    莫伊谢耶夫强调，苏联在战略、战役和战术方面训练武装力量时把防御放在首位绝不是“消极行为”，也不是把“主动权完全交给侵略者”。
    人们注意到，苏军总参谋长莫伊谢耶夫这篇重要文章是在欧洲裁减常规力量谈判在维也纳刚开始不久、华约国家宣布单方面裁军的决定尚未得到北约国家积极响应的情况下发表的。
