Recently, we conducted a sample survey of 100 households in Huisheng County, which revealed that by the end of 1988, 25.8% of youth aged 6 to 17 had dropped out of school. Among those aged 15 to 17, the dropout rate exceeded 50%.

The reasons for this are as follows: First, tuition and miscellaneous fees are too high, placing a heavy financial burden on students' families, especially those with many mouths to feed and financial difficulties. Currently, educational funds are tight, particularly in rural primary schools. Some schools, in order to improve educational conditions, collect various fees under different names. From 1986 to 1988, the tuition and miscellaneous fees for a middle school student in this area increased annually, amounting to 13 yuan, 21 yuan, and 33 yuan respectively. Coupled with the difficulty of advancing to higher education, some parents stop their children's education after they complete primary school.

Second, influenced by the societal trend of "money worship," some 15- to 16-year-old youths do not want to study, believing that making money is more practical than studying.

Third, some parents hold the one-sided view that studying is only useful if one can enter university; otherwise, it is better to start farming at home or engage in transportation or sideline businesses early.

We hope that the situation in Huisheng County will attract the attention of relevant departments.

### 会同农家子弟失学多

　　会同农家子弟失学多
    最近，我们在会同县作了一次百户农户抽样调查，结果表明：１９８８年底，６岁至１７岁的青少年有２５．８％失学，其中１５岁至１７岁青少年的失学率超过５０％。
    究其原因：一是学杂费太高，给学生家庭造成很重的经济负担，一些人口多、生活困难的农户就更难承受。现在，教育经费紧张，尤其是乡村小学经费更紧。有的学校为了改善办学条件，以各种名目收取学杂费，１９８６至１９８８年，这里一个中学生的学杂费逐年增长，分别是１３元、２１元、３３元；加上升学难度大，一些家长供子女读完小学便止步了。二是受社会上“向钱看”风气的影响，一些十五六岁的青少年不愿读书，认为读书不如捞钱实惠。三是一些家长片面地认为读书一定要考大学才有用，否则不如早点在家务农或跑运输、搞副业。
    会同县这一情况希能引起有关部门重视。
