On the afternoon of the 18th, during the first press conference of the second session of the 7th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), journalists from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan sat alongside mainland journalists. More than twenty journalists from Hong Kong and Taiwan were particularly active, occupying a large section in the middle of the press seats, and promptly placing various large and small recording devices in front of them.

"Journalists from Hong Kong and Taiwan can interview all CPPCC members, and all members have the freedom to be interviewed," announced Lu Zhichao, Vice Secretary-General of the CPPCC.

This year's CPPCC meeting is an annual session, not a session for changing the leadership, so there are fewer journalists from China and abroad compared to last year. However, the news media from Hong Kong and Taiwan seem to have paid special attention to this conference, with an unprecedented number of journalists attending. Last year, only two journalists came from Taiwan, but this year, thirteen came. Forty-three journalists came from Hong Kong and Macau, also more than last year.

Xu Lu, a journalist from Taiwan's "Independent Evening News," said, "During our interview with Mr. Lin Shengzhong, we were interfered with by hotel staff, who rudely questioned us. Can the CPPCC guarantee that in future interviews, we will not be treated rudely by staff?"

Xu Lu came to the mainland for self-funded reporting more than a year ago and became one of the first Taiwanese journalists to enter the mainland for reporting, which caused a lawsuit in Taiwan. She was eventually found not guilty.

"I apologize for the situation Ms. Xu Lu encountered," Lu Zhichao said. He explained, "Our conference is still in the initial stage and is somewhat chaotic. We will do our best to improve our work to avoid such situations. At the same time, we hope to cooperate well with journalists from all over the world to ensure that your reporting proceeds smoothly."

One hour after the CPPCC press conference ended, journalists from China and abroad met again at a reception held by the "News Center" of the Chinese Journalists Association. The head of the NPC news group, Yao Guang, holding a drink, walked among the journalists from Hong Kong and Taiwan asking about the difficulties they encountered during their reporting. Xu Lu and others complained again, and Yao Guang smiled, "We need to improve our work." Fan Rongkang, deputy editor-in-chief of the People's Daily, said to Xu Lu, "This is your second time coming to the mainland. Welcome to come a third time. Unfortunately, Taiwan has restrictions, and I can't go because I am a member of the Communist Party." Xu Lu smiled and said, "I think it will be resolved."

　　海峡两岸记者在一起
    本报记者  凌志军
    十八日下午，在七届全国政协二次会议举行的第一次新闻发布会上，来自港台的记者和大陆的记者坐在一起。二十多位港台记者格外活跃，把记者席的中间占了很大一片，紧接着便把大大小小的录音机摆到前面。
    “来自港台的记者可以采访所有的政协委员，所有委员都有接受采访的自由。”全国政协副秘书长卢之超这样宣布。
    今年的政协会是一次年度的例会，而非换届的会议，中外记者来得比去年少些。但港台新闻界对这次会议似乎格外关注，来的记者也从未有过的多。台湾去年只来了两人，这次来了十三人。港澳来了四十三人，也多于去年。
    台湾《自立晚报》记者徐璐说：“我和我的同事去采访林盛中先生过程中，受到宾馆工作人员的干扰，而且非常粗鲁地讯问我们。请问政协可不可以保证，在未来的采访中，我们可以不受到工作人员粗鲁的对待？”
    徐璐在一年多前自费来大陆采访，成为台湾最先进入大陆采访的记者之一，因此在台湾惹起一场官司，最终判为无罪。
    “我对徐璐女士遇到这种状况表示道歉”，卢之超说。他解释道，“我们的会议还在开始阶段，还比较混乱，我们将尽力做好工作，避免这种状况发生。同时，我们希望同来自各地的记者很好合作，使你们的采访愉快地进行。”
    政协新闻发布会结束后一小时，中国记协“新闻中心”举行的招待会上，中外记者再次相遇。人大新闻组组长姚广举着饮料杯走到港台记者中间询问他们采访中有什么困难，徐璐等人又诉起苦来，姚广笑道：“我们要改进工作。”《人民日报》副总编辑范荣康对徐璐说：“你是第二次来大陆了，欢迎你以后再来第三次。可惜台湾有禁令，我去不了，因为我是中共党员。”徐璐笑道：“我想会解决的。”
