Kabul Foreign Minister Meets with Rajiv Gandhi
Discusses Situation in Afghanistan After Soviet Withdrawal

New Delhi, March 3 (Xinhua) - Afghanistan's Kabul government Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil met with Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Foreign Minister Narasimha Rao today to discuss the situation in Afghanistan following the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops.

An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that Wakil handed over a letter from Kabul government leader Najibullah to Rajiv Gandhi. During the nearly 30-minute meeting, the foreign minister briefed Rajiv Gandhi on the latest developments in Afghanistan.

The spokesperson added that Wakil also held a one-hour meeting with Foreign Minister Rao, but did not disclose the specifics of the discussion.

Local newspapers speculated that the Kabul government foreign minister's visit to India might be related to India's potential humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Due to the blockade by Afghan Mujahideen, the city of Kabul, with a population of 2 million, is facing severe shortages of food and fuel.

Indian officials stated that if the Kabul government makes a request, New Delhi would be willing to provide food aid to Kabul.

　　喀布尔外长会晤拉·甘地
    讨论苏联撤军后的阿富汗局势
    新华社新德里３月３日电  阿富汗喀布尔政权外长阿卜杜勒·瓦基勒今天先后会晤了印度总理拉·甘地和外长纳拉辛哈·拉奥，就苏联全部撤军后的阿富汗局势进行了交谈。
    印度外交部新闻发言人说，瓦基勒向拉·甘地转交了喀布尔政权领导人纳吉布拉的一封信。在近３０分钟的会谈中，这位外长向拉·甘地通报了阿富汗的最新情况。
    这位发言人说，瓦基勒还与拉奥外长进行了１小时会谈。但他没有透露会谈的具体内容。
    据当地报纸估计，喀布尔政权外长的印度之行，可能与印度将向阿富汗提供的人道主义援助有关。由于阿富汗游击队对喀布尔进行封锁，使现有２００万人口的喀布尔市内的食品和燃料十分短缺。
    印度官方人士说，如果喀布尔政权提出请求的话，新德里可能愿意向喀布尔提供食品援助。
