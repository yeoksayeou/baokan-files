    Year Weishi, the chairman of the Chinese Football Association, recently criticized various unhealthy practices within the Chinese football community at a national football training and key regional work conference.

    Year Weishi pointed out that the Chinese football community should stop engaging in shameful activities such as match-fixing, backroom deals, "gentlemen's agreements," and factionalism. Otherwise, the level of Chinese football will never improve.

    Year Weishi said that various unhealthy practices from society have infiltrated the Chinese football community, such as cheating during matches, poor conduct, lax management, mutual blame, forming cliques, and focusing on training without results. These ugly phenomena have seriously harmed the development of Chinese football.

    Year Weishi also advised coaches and athletes who are content with the status quo and lack ambition to stop merely getting by. They should always feel pressure and have a sense of crisis. He emphasized that only by uniting and working together can the backward state of Chinese football be significantly improved.

    This chairman, who has been involved in football for many years, also spoke earnestly, saying that doing football work in China is very difficult. He hoped that coaches would have the spirit of facing difficulties head-on, work hard through their own efforts, and be upright individuals. Otherwise, they would not be able to lead a good team.

　　年维泗批评我国足球界不正之风        
    呼吁不要再搞那些打假球等可耻的事
    中国足球协会主席年维泗在最近举行的全国足球训练和足球重点地区工作会议上，严肃批评了我国足球界的种种不正之风。
    年维泗指出，我国足球界不要再搞那些打假球、拉拉扯扯、“君子”协定、门户之见等可耻的事了，否则我国足球运动水平永远上不去。
    年维泗说，社会上的种种不正之风已侵蚀了我国足球界，如比赛时弄虚作假、作风粗野；管理上松松垮垮，放任自流，互相扯皮，搞小圈子；训练上不讲实效；失败后推卸责任等。这些丑恶的现象已严重危害了我国足球运动的发展。
    年维泗还奉劝那些只想维持现状，不图进取的教练和运动员，不能再混日子了，要时时感到有压力，要有危机感。他强调，只有团结一致、齐心协力，我国足球落后的现状才会有大的改变。
    这位多年从事足球运动的足协主席还语重心长地说，在中国搞足球事业困难很多，希望教练们要有知难而进的精神，要通过自身的努力，做一个堂堂正正的人，否则是不能带好一支队伍的。
