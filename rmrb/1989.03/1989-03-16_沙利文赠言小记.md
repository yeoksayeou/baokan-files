	Notes on Sullivan's Advice
	People's Daily reporter Lü Zhènhuá

	"I am not an expert on China, but I am happy to offer some words of advice to relevant departments in China." In Beijing, during a chance encounter, the president of the American MTS Systems Company, Sullivan, began a casual conversation with Chinese journalists. "Our company has been cooperating with China for exactly 10 years. Nearly 100 scientific research institutions and industrial enterprises in China have our provided experimental equipment. China has obtained advanced technology, and our company has also benefited. It can be said that this is a successful cooperation that satisfies both parties."

	"What do you feel most deeply about in your cooperation with China?"

	"It can be summarized in two words: big and slow. China's territory is vast, the market is large, and the government's reform resolve is great; at the same time, China's institutions are overlapping, and the procedures for handling matters are too cumbersome, so the work efficiency is slow. The time we spend on a single business deal is two to three times longer than in other countries, and the cost is much higher. Even a project that has been discussed for eight or nine years cannot be finalized." He paused for a moment, then suddenly said softly, "I also have worries! Applying for an international telephone line, two years have passed, but there is still no news. It's simply hopeless!"

	This American was very frank, perhaps he could reveal some genuine thoughts. The reporters tentatively asked, "Do you have any suggestions for developing economic cooperation between the two sides?"

	"Suggestions? I don't call them suggestions, but rather opinions." Sullivan blinked a few times with his blue eyes, thought for a moment, and said, "China should pay attention to the development of energy, transportation, communications, and raw materials, and to the related technologies and imports. This is like the source of a great sea, without a source there is no great water. Relying solely on textiles and handicrafts to build a country, the path to changing the entire economic landscape is too distant. Increasing the development of deep-processing products can fundamentally change the situation of foreign exchange shortages. Another, equally important point, is to streamline bureaucratic institutions, reduce layers, and improve work efficiency. It would be best to publicize the cooperation channels, methods, and which matters are handled by whom. We welcome increased transparency."

	MTS Systems Company is a high-tech development company in the United States with extensive global connections. In his interactions with various countries, this president has thought a lot about matters related to China.

　　沙利文赠言小记
    本报记者  陆振华
    “我不是中国问题专家，但乐意向中国有关部门敬赠数言。”在北京一次偶然的机会，美国ＭＴＳ系统公司的总裁沙利文和中国记者开始了一次轻松的谈话，“我公司和中国合作整整１０年，中国近１００个科研单位和工业企业有我们提供的试验设备，中国得到了先进技术，本公司也得利，可谓双满意的成功合作。”
    “你在同中国合作中感融最深的是什么？”
    “可以概括为二个字：大和慢，中国国土大，市场大，政府改革决心大；同时，中国机构重叠，办事手续太繁杂，因而工作效率慢。我们做一笔生意所花的时间比其他国家多二三倍，成本高出许多。甚至一个项目谈了八九年也定不下来。”他停了一下，忽然又小声地说：“我也有愁啊！申请装一条国际电话线，２年过去了，但仍杳无音信。简直毫无办法！”
    这位美国人很坦率，也许能掏出些真心话，记者们试探地问：“你对发展双方经济合作有什么建议？”
    “有。但不叫建议，只可称作意见。”沙利文眨了几下蓝色的眼睛，沉思片刻，说，“中国要重视能源、交通、通信、原材料方面的发展，重视与之相关技术和引进。这好比大海的源，无源没大水。光靠纺织品、工艺品打天下，改变整个经济面貌路程太遥远。增加深加工品开发，才能彻底改变外汇短缺现状。另外，也是极重要的一条，要精简官僚机构，减少层次，提高工作效率。最好把合作渠道、方式、方法和哪些事由谁办，都广而告之。我们欢迎增加透明度。”
    ＭＴＳ系统公司是美国一家高技术开发公司，同世界有广泛的联系。在与各国交往中，这位总裁思考了许多有关中国的事。
