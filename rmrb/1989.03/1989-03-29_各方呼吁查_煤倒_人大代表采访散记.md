It is often said that soldiers are the backbone of wartime, and miners are the backbone of the construction period. This underscores the importance of miners.

On the night of March 25, People's Representative Zhang Fusheng, the team leader of the comprehensive mining team at Wuda Coal Mine's Wuhushan Mine, sought out the reporter, speaking earnestly: "The income of coal miners is too low." He said that in Wuda Coal Mine, the wages, bonuses, and various subsidies for underground workers were 2,556 yuan in 1987 and only 2,604 yuan in 1988, an increase of 1.8%, while the national average wage increase for the same period was 22.1%.

The low income of miners is mainly due to the severe losses of raw coal production enterprises. People's Representative and Mayor of Handan City, Hebei Province, Bai Lutan, said that in 1988, Fengfeng Coal Mine and Handan Coal Mine contributed about 200 million yuan to the city's finances, while the city's subsidies for grain, eggs, and meat to the coal mines reached 300 million yuan. Currently, more than two-thirds of frontline coal miners are temporary agricultural workers. Due to the sharp increase in the price of negotiated grain, the income of temporary workers has sharply decreased, and many have left the mines to return to their villages before and after the Spring Festival. According to an informed representative, Shanxi Province alone has reduced its workforce by 200,000 people due to this.

The shortage of coal affects the power supply of several major power grids, and many factories are operating at reduced capacity due to power shortages. Recently, relevant officials briefed the People's Representatives: given the full industry losses of planned coal mines, the state plans to appropriately increase coal prices. This news brought joy to many representatives, but also added doubts: without thoroughly rectifying the "middlemen" during this time, how much of the price increase will actually reach the coal production enterprises? It is said that currently, the price of coal in Shanxi is only 30-40 yuan per ton, but when "flipped" to Zhejiang, the price per ton increases by more than five times to around 200 yuan. Today, in Qinhuangdao Port, there are more than 140 companies involved in coal trading.

Why is it that despite knowing there are so many "coal flippers," they are not decisively shut down? Why, with so many "coal flippers" rampant in the market, are they not shut down? Many People's Representatives raised questions. A People's Representative from Zhejiang Province said that the state's rectification of the circulation sector must take decisive measures. Otherwise, today they crack down, tomorrow they crack down, the "coal flippers" hibernate, and when the "weather" warms up, they will rise again.

### 各方呼吁查“煤倒”——人大代表采访散记

　　各方呼吁查“煤倒”        
    ——人大代表采访散记
    本报记者  潘岗
    常言道，战争年代的士兵，建设时期的矿工。足见矿工的地位。
    ３月２５日夜，人大代表、乌达矿务局五虎山矿综采一队队长张福生找到记者，意切言恳：“煤矿工人收入太低了”。他说，乌达矿务局井下工人工资奖金加各种补贴，１９８７年为２５５６元，１９８８年也只有２６０４元，增长１．８％，而同期全国职工工资总额比上年增长２２．１％。
    矿工收入低，主要是原煤生产企业严重亏损。人大代表、河北省邯郸市市长白录堂说，１９８８年，峰峰矿务局、邯郸矿务局上交市财政２０００万元左右，而同期市里对矿务局的粮、蛋、肉补贴达３０００万元。目前，一线采煤工有２／３以上是农民临时工。因议价粮价格猛涨，临时工收入锐减，春节前后纷纷离矿返乡。据一位知情的代表说，仅山西就因此减员２０万人。
    煤炭短缺，影响几大电网供电，许多工厂缺电开工不足。日前，有关负责人向人大代表“交底”：鉴于统配矿全行业亏损，国家准备适当上调煤炭价格。此话一出，许多代表欣喜之余，又添疑虑：在“中间环节”未彻底整顿之时，这些提价款，真正能“流”到煤炭生产企业又有多少？据说，如今山西煤在当地吨价只有三四十元，而“倒”到浙江，吨价就提高５倍以上，达２００元左右。在今日的秦皇岛港，插手煤炭经营的公司就有１４０多个。
    明知有那么多“煤倒”为何不坚决取缔？有那么多“煤倒”盛行于市为何取缔不了？许多人大代表提出质询。浙江省一位人大代表说，国家对流通领域的整顿，一定要拿出坚决的措施。要不，今天抓一下，明天抓一下，“煤倒”躲过“冬眠”，等“天气”变“暖”，还会东山再起。
