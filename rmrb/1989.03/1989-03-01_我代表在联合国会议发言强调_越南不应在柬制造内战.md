Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, February 27th.

China's permanent representative to the United Nations office in Geneva, Qian Jiao Dong, said today that if Vietnam genuinely intends to resolve the Cambodian issue, it should not only completely withdraw its troops from Cambodia under strict and effective international supervision but also should not in any form manufacture civil war and turmoil in Cambodia.

Qian Jiao Dong made these remarks at the 45th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. He stressed that Vietnam bears an unshirkable responsibility for achieving domestic peace in Cambodia.

He believed that to ensure that no new dangerous situation arises in Cambodia after Vietnam's withdrawal, the Cambodian interim joint government must be headed by Prince Sihanouk and have representatives from all four parties participating on an equal basis.

Qian Jiao Dong said that some people are now worried about the danger of the Khmer Rouge regaining power, but one should not overlook another danger, that is, the possibility of the Hun Sen-Khieu Samphan faction seizing power alone. Although Vietnam emphasizes that it does not interfere in Cambodia's internal affairs, it is precisely trying to achieve this goal.

### 我代表在联合国会议发言强调  越南不应在柬制造内战

　　我代表在联合国会议发言强调
    越南不应在柬制造内战
    新华社日内瓦２月２７日电  中国常驻联合国日内瓦办事处代表钱嘉东今天在这里说，如果越南真有解决柬埔寨问题的诚意，那么它就不仅应在严格有效的国际监督下真正地从柬全部撤军，而且不应以任何形式在柬制造内战和动乱。
    钱嘉东是在联合国人权委员会第４５届会议上发言时说这番话的。他强调，越南对实现柬埔寨的国内和平负有不可推卸的责任。
    他认为，为保证在越南撤军后不在柬埔寨出现新的危险局势，柬埔寨临时联合政府必须以西哈努克亲王为首，并有四方代表在平等基础上参加。
    钱嘉东说，现在有人担心红色高棉重新掌权的危险，但是，决不能由此而忽视另一个危险，即韩桑林—洪森派单独掌权。尽管越南强调它不干涉柬埔寨的内政，而它竭力企图达到的却正是这样的目的。
