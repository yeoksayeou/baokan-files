The Chinese people have had the habit of drinking tea for a long time, but the exact origin of tea houses is still uncertain.

During the Han Dynasty, Wang Bao recorded the tea market in Pengshan County, Sichuan, but there was no mention of "tea houses." The famous calligrapher Yan Zhenqing once wrote an inscription for a tea house: "Inviting guests to the cold flowers, leading to pure conversations." Therefore, it can be concluded that by the Tang Dynasty, China already had tea houses. By the Song Dynasty, tea houses in Bianliang (Kaifeng) and Lin'an (Hangzhou) were already quite prosperous, known as "tea stalls" and "tea shops." By the Qing Dynasty during the reign of Emperor Qianlong, tea houses were widespread in both the north and south. Beijing's tea gardens even invited performers to entertain guests. By this time, tea houses were no longer just places for drinking tea.

Ancient people also paid great attention to the environment for drinking tea. According to the Ming Dynasty scholar Lu Shusheng's "Record of the Flower House," the ideal place for drinking tea is "cool terrace, quiet room, bright window, winding river, Buddhist temple, Taoist monastery. Pine wind and bamboo moon, walking and chatting..." Of course, for ordinary citizens, tea houses were indeed good places for socializing and chatting, making people linger and forget to leave.

### 茶馆的来历

　　茶馆的来历
    我国人民虽早有饮茶习惯，但茶馆源于何时，目前尚无定论。
    汉时，王褒虽然记述了四川彭山县的茶叶市场，但却没有“茶馆”这一名称。大书法家颜真卿，曾为茶馆书有这样一副对联：“冷花邀座客，代饮引清言。”因而可以断言，至少在唐朝我国就有了茶馆。至宋代，汴京和临安的茶馆业已十分繁荣，称之为“茗坊”、“茶肆”。到了清代乾隆年间，茶馆普及南北方。北京的茶园，还邀请艺人到茶园献艺助兴。此时的茶馆，已不纯为饮茶之所了。
    古人对饮茶环境也很讲究。据明人陆树声《花寮记》记载，饮茶的理想之地是“凉台、静室、明窗、曲江、僧寮、道院。松风竹月，行吟清谈……”当然，对于一般市民来说，茶馆确实是会友清谈，令人流连忘返的好去处。
