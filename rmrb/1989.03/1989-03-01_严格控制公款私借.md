Title: Strictly Control Public Funds Borrowing for Private Use

Recently, during a cash and credit inspection in our district's financial system, it was discovered that some units have a serious problem with individuals borrowing public funds for private use. For example, out of 123 units in Nanchong County, 46 have this issue, with large amounts and long durations. Additionally, in Neixiang County Cement Factory, out of a loan of 10.4 million yuan, 2.24 million yuan was borrowed by individuals.

Those who borrow public funds include employees of the unit as well as other individuals from society. The amounts range from a few hundred yuan to tens of thousands of yuan. In terms of duration, some loans are not repaid for one or two years, while others go unpaid for three to five years.

The reasons for borrowing include: first, borrowing for travel expenses or medical treatment outside the unit and not settling the accounts upon return; second, borrowing to build houses or buy high-end consumer goods; third, borrowing public funds for business or reselling scarce commodities. Additionally, some individuals borrow public funds to deposit in banks and earn interest. This situation not only affects the normal business activities of enterprises and institutions but also corrupts some officials.

To address this problem, I suggest the following: each unit should thoroughly investigate the situation of borrowing public funds and require repayment within a specified period. In the future, borrowing of public funds should be strictly controlled. The amount of public funds borrowed for travel should be strictly controlled based on the number of travelers, time, and tasks. Upon return, accounts must be settled promptly. For those who go out for medical treatment or hospitalization, if the medical expenses exceed 100 yuan, they should be settled directly by the medical unit or financial department. If it is found that public funds are privately deposited to earn interest, severe penalties should be imposed.

### 严格控制公款私借

　　严格控制公款私借
    不久前，我区金融系统在现金、信贷大检查中，发现一些单位私人借公款的现象比较严重。如南召县１２３个单位中，就有４６个单位存在这一问题，且数额大、时间长。又如内乡县水泥厂贷款１０４万元，却有２２．４万元被私人借走。
    借公款的人，有本单位的职工，也有社会上其他人员；从数额上看，少则数百元，多则上万元；从时间上看，有的借款一二年，有的三五年不予归还。
    借款原因：一是出差借支、外出治病借款，回单位后，不及时结算；二是借款盖房、买高档消费品；三是借公款经商、倒卖紧俏商品。此外，还有个别人借公款存银行，坐吃利息。这种情况，不仅影响企事业单位的正常业务活动，还腐蚀了一些干部。
    为解决这一问题，我建议：各单位应认真清理借支公款的情况，并限期归还，今后要严格控制借支公款。对于出差借支的公款金额，要根据出差人数“时间、任务，严格控制，返回后，必须按时结清帐目。凡外出就医或住院，其医疗费用在１００元以上者，应由医疗单位或财务部门直接转帐结算。如发现公款私存，谋取利息者，要给以严惩。中国人民银行河南省南阳分行　靳向阳
