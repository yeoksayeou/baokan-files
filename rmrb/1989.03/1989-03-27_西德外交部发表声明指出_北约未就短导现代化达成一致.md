The West German Foreign Ministry issued a statement today in Bonn denying that NATO has reached a consensus on the modernization of short-range missiles in Europe.

The spokesperson made this oral statement to the German News Agency in response to a report from Brussels.

According to news from Brussels, the Belgian Defense Department today confirmed that a NATO expert group reached a "common position" on the modernization of short-range missiles at a meeting on the 22nd and unanimously agreed to resolve this long-standing issue through compromise. According to this plan, the production and research of new short-range missiles with a range of less than 500 kilometers will be approved, but no decision will be made on deployment for the time being.

The West German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that the report from Brussels has "no basis." He said that the NATO allies have not reached a consensus on the modernization of short-range missiles.

Local sources believe that the West German Foreign Ministry spokesperson's hasty statement indicates that the differences between West Germany and the United States on the modernization of short-range missiles have not been resolved.

After the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union, the modernization of short-range missiles became a contentious issue within NATO. The United States and the United Kingdom advocate for the development, production, and deployment of new short-range missiles and urge NATO to make a quick decision on the "modernization" of short-range missiles. However, West Germany, considering domestic politics and the need to improve relations with the Soviet Union, advocates for not rushing to make a decision on the modernization of short-range missiles. In February of this year, West German Chancellor Kohl explicitly stated that there is no need to make a decision on the "production of the follow-up system (Lance)" before 1991-1992.

### 西德外交部发表声明指出  北约未就短导现代化达成一致

　　西德外交部发表声明指出        
    北约未就短导现代化达成一致
    新华社波恩３月２５日电  （记者戴履斌）西德外交部发言人今天下午在波恩发表声明，否认北约已就欧洲短导现代化问题达成一致意见。
    这位发言人是针对布鲁塞尔一则报道对德新社发表这一口头声明的。
    据来自布鲁塞尔的消息说，比利时国防部今天证实，北约一个专家小组在２２日的会议上已就短导现代化问题取得“共同立场”，并一致同意妥协解决这一争论不休的问题。根据这一方案，将批准北约研究和生产５００公里射程以下的新式短导，但先不就部署问题作出决定。
    西德外交部发言人说，来自布鲁塞尔的这一报道没有“任何根据”。他说，北约盟国并未就短导现代化问题作出一致决定。
    此间人士认为，西德外交部发言人匆忙作此声明，表明西德同美国在短导现代化问题上的分歧还没有消除。
    美苏中导条约签订后，短导现代化问题成了北约内部争论不休的问题。美国和英国主张发展、生产和部署新式短导，并要求北约就短导“现代化”问题迅速作出决定。但是，西德方面出于内政和改善对苏关系的需要，则主张不要就短导现代化问题急于作出决定。今年２月，西德总理科尔明确表示，在１９９１—１９９２年以前，没有必要就“生产（长矛）后续系统”问题作出决定。
