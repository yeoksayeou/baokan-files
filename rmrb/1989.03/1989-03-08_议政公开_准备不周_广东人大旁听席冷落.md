Yesterday morning, the third plenary session of the second session of the Seventh Guangdong Provincial People's Congress was held, with very few people in the audience seats.

Before the meeting, 75 people signed up to attend, which was 1/4 fewer than the originally planned 100 seats. On the first day of the meeting, March 2, there were many people who signed up but did not attend. Yesterday morning's session had only 32 attendees, with a few people dozing off or chatting softly with their neighbors.

Some attendees commented that setting up audience seats is a first for Guangdong Provincial People's Congress meetings and is a significant step towards increasing transparency. However, they regretted that there was insufficient publicity beforehand, and the application process was not simplified enough. The specific arrangements for attending were also quite rigid. As a result, on the first day of the meeting, many people applied to attend through the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Provincial Youth Federation, while the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce had very few applicants. Departments with fewer applicants had to allocate seats to individuals, thus losing the voluntary nature of the process. Those who obtained the right to attend were only allowed to attend three sessions as arranged. Yesterday morning was the last session. Some of them did not come because they could not choose which sessions to attend and were not interested in the content of the speeches. Others could not come due to work commitments, making the audience seats increasingly sparse.

### 议政公开　准备不周  广东人大旁听席冷落

　　议政公开　准备不周
    广东人大旁听席冷落
    本报广州３月７日电  记者梁兆明报道：昨天上午，广东省七届人大二次会议举行第三次大会，旁听席上人数寥寥。
    会前报名旁听的共有７５人，比原来暂定１００个名额少了１／４。２日开幕这一天的两次大会，报了名但没有来旁听的人不少。昨天上午的大会，旁听者减至３２人，有少数人还在打瞌睡，或与邻座轻声攀谈。
    一些旁听者议论说：设旁听席是广东省历届人大会议的第一次，是增加透明度的一大进步，可惜事前宣传不够，又不是自由报名，而是把名额分配到各团体，申请手续也不够简化，旁听的具体做法亦比较呆板。结果，会前向省总工会、省青联申请旁听的人员较多，名额供不应求，而省文联、工商联则寥寥无几。申请旁听人员少的部门，只好把名额分配到人，也就失去了自愿意义。取得旁听资格的人员，只能按安排旁听３次大会，昨天上午是最后一次。他们当中，有的因为不能有选择地来旁听，对大会发言内容不感兴趣而不来，有的因工作在身来不了，旁听席也就一次比一次稀落。
