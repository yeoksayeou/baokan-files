It might be due to the openness of public opinion that people are increasingly concerned about the serious situation and consequences of education and science and technology. It might also be due to the sudden change in the economic environment that people have begun to doubt whether the traditional investment lever can continue to support economic operations. This early spring, the consecutive meetings of Zhejiang Province's science and technology and education work conferences have presented an unusual atmosphere from the very beginning.

An obvious change is that, in addition to representatives from the science and technology and education circles, the top decision-makers from all cities, counties, and districts across the province were almost all ordered to attend. This is quite rare in usual professional conferences.

Science and technology, and education are considered one of the hottest issues today, and the two conferences naturally became the focus of local news units' reporting. However, some reporters felt an indescribable unease: they couldn't find exciting news leads and couldn't arouse their professional excitement.

"The key is the lack of money," some representatives from the science and technology and education circles said. Others believed that "discussing education and science and technology has nothing new to say, the most important thing is how much investment to increase." A scholar studying social sciences discovered: when the provincial leaders' report, which was resolute and strong in language, ended, a sense of disappointment quietly spread in the venue, the reason being that there was no detailed discussion of specific investments.

Although the provincial leaders reminded the representatives not to discuss only the investment issue, like an omnipresent "shadow," the money problem still remained an obstacle that many representatives could not bypass.

A certain company, because it obtained a new technology, is thriving and famous. The research unit that developed this new technology only received 100,000 yuan in transfer fees for this, while the company spends hundreds of thousands of yuan on advertising and promotion every year—is technology not valuable, or is the effect of advertising more tempting?

In recent years, the dropout rate of primary and secondary schools in Zhejiang has gradually increased, and a large number of children have dropped out of school to make money. There are also many college graduates who are cold-shouldered in their job assignments—is knowledge devalued, or is "studying useless books" annoying?

A certain research institute successfully developed a new technology for rice fertilization, which can save fertilizer and increase yield, but it is difficult to promote it on a large scale. The province still has 70% of agricultural science and technology achievements that are idle—is it because there is no money for promotion, or is it because farmers are not interested?

Despite the fact that this is an important conference that decides the direction of Zhejiang Province's science and technology and education development, people vaguely feel that some influence from outside the venue seems to have weakened the importance of the conference.

Almost at the same time as the two conferences were held, the provincial capital Hangzhou was also holding an emergency meeting. Due to the tightening of credit, the city was short of several hundred million yuan in funds, and economic operations were seriously hindered. The mayors faced: some factories could not operate, some goods could not be put on the shelves, and more importantly, how to stabilize public sentiment...

Again, it's the money problem! At the science and technology and education conference, a county magistrate privately revealed his true thoughts: education and science and technology are indeed important. But now there are too many important things. There are food problems, family planning problems, and so many enterprises lack funds, energy, and materials. How can we sit still?

We always hope that education and science and technology will bring great material power, but at the same time, we are in a dilemma because of the lack of material power to start education and science and technology. Perhaps behind the material starting point, there is an even more difficult starting point?

Just before the science and technology and education work conferences were held, a tragedy occurred on the coast more than 200 kilometers away from the provincial capital. A young farmer, Xu Chengfa, who had made a major archaeological discovery, was crushed by the cold eyes, ridicule, and insults of his fellow villagers and drowned himself.

"This family is ruined, the pterosaur harmed him!" Xu Chengfa's old father looked up to the sky and sighed. To be precise, it was ignorance that harmed this agricultural archaeology hero. The government's generous rewards and material relief could not stop this tragedy.

The farmer who "sacrificed" for science will not become the discussion topic of the provincial science and technology and education conference. However, another debate took place among a few reporters and representatives—

"Where did Wenzhou City go wrong in implementing the 'negotiated tuition'?"

"Obviously, it violated national regulations and deviated from the direction of running schools."

"Implementing 'negotiated tuition' increased educational funds. People are willing to pay high tuition to study, which shows that knowledge will not depreciate."

"Because they couldn't afford the high tuition, a primary school student in Hangzhou committed suicide, which has already been condemned by society."

"Why doesn't the private high school run by a rural teacher in Anji County get support?"

"It's also about overcharging fees, with a semester's tuition fee of 150 yuan, who can afford it?"

"I heard he hired a group of retired teachers with high qualifications, and many parents, including those from other provinces, were willing to send their children to this private school. This year, the school's more than 100 graduates ranked second in the county in the college entrance examination. Many students have become backbones in township enterprises. How do you explain this?"

"He runs the school for money, turning the school into a 'learning store'."

"Many universities abroad are privately run. If we can really make money by running education, we won't have to argue endlessly about increasing investment, isn't that meaningful!"

Again, we are stuck with the money problem. Where does the money come from? Where does the money go? Can the tragedies caused by the obstruction of the system, the rigidity of ideas, and ignorance all be explained by money? It seems that here, what is more needed is a firm reform and exploration.

### 寻找新的启动点——浙江省科技、教育会议内外

　　寻找新的启动点
    ——浙江省科技、教育会议内外
    本报记者  高海浩
    也许是社会舆论的开放，使人们日益关注教育、科技的严重现状和后果；也许是经济环境的骤变，使人们开始怀疑传统的投入杠杆能否继续支撑经济运行。今年初春，相继召开的浙江省科技、教育工作会议，一开始便呈现非同寻常的氛围。
    明显的变化是，除了科技、教育界的代表，全省各地、市、县的最高决策首脑几乎全部奉命到会。这在通常的专业性会议上颇为少见。
    科技、教育被称为当今几大热点问题之一，两个会议自然成了当地新闻单位的报道重点。但一些记者却感到一种难言的不安：抓不到精彩的新闻线索，难以激起职业的亢奋。
    “关键是缺钱。”一些科技、教育界的代表说，也有的认为“讨论教育、科技已说不出新套套，最重要的是增加多少投资。”一位研究社会科学的学者发现：当省领导决心坚定、措词强硬的报告结束时，会场上悄悄溢出一股深感失望的情绪，原因是没有详谈具体投入的信息。
    尽管省领导提醒代表们，不要仅仅讨论投入问题。但如同一个无处不在的“影子”，钱的困扰仍是不少代表无法绕开的障碍。
    某公司因为获得一项新技术生意兴隆，名声大振。研制这项新技术的科研单位为此仅得１０多万元转让费，而公司每年花去的广告宣传费高达上百万元——是技术不值钱，还是广告的作用更诱人？
    近几年，浙江中小学流生率逐渐上升，大批孩子丢掉书包去赚钱，还有不少大学生毕业分配受冷落——是知识贬值，还是“读无用书”令人厌烦？
    某科研所研制成功一项水稻施肥新技术，既可节省化肥，又能提高产量，但难以全面推广。全省还有７０％的农业科技成果被闲置——是无钱推广，还是农民没有兴趣？
    ……
    尽管这是决定浙江省科技、教育发展走向的重要会议，但人们隐隐感到，来自会场之外的某种影响力似乎淡化了会议的重要性。
    几乎与两个会议召开的同时，省城杭州也在开一个紧急会议。由于银根紧缩，全市短缺资金数亿元，经济运行严重受阻。市长们面临的是：有些工厂难以开工，有些商品难以上柜，更重要的是人心如何稳定……
    又是钱的困扰！在科技、教育会议上，有位县长私下流露真实想法：教育科技确实重要。可现在重要的事情太多了。粮食问题、计划生育问题、还有那么多企业缺资金、缺能源、缺材料，我们怎能坐得住。
    我们总是希望教育、科技带来巨大的物质力量，同时又为缺乏物质力量启动教育、科技而左右两难。也许在物质启动点的背后还有更难的启动？
    就在科技、教育工作会议召开前夕，离省城２００多公里的海边发生了一场悲剧。曾获重大考古发现的一位青年农民徐成法被同村人的冷眼、讥讽和侮骂压垮，蹈海自尽。
    “这个家完了，翼龙害了他啊！”徐成法的老父亲仰天长叹。准确地说，是愚昧残害了这位农民考古功臣。政府的重金奖励、物质救济毕竟无法制止这场悲剧。
    为科学“殉葬”的这位农民显然不会成为全省科技、教育会议的讨论主题。而在几位记者和代表之间发生了另一场争论——
    “温州市实行‘议价生’错在哪里？”
    “明显违反了国家规定，偏离了办学方向。”
    “搞‘议价生’增加了教育经费。人们愿意出高价读书，不是正能说明知识不会贬值。”
    “因为付不起高学费，致使杭州一位小学生自杀，已经引起社会的谴责。”
    “安吉县有位农村教师办私立高中为什么得不到支持？”
    “也是乱收费，一学期的学费要１５０元，谁付得起。”
    “听说他聘请了一批有水平的退休教师，许多家长包括外省的，愿意把孩子送到这所私立学校。该校今年的１００多毕业生，高考成绩全县第二。许多学生进乡镇企业都成了骨干，这又如何解释？”
    “他办学是为了赚钱，使学校成了‘学店’。”
    “国外许多大学都是私人办的。如果我们办教育真能赚钱，不再为增加投资而争论不休，这不是很有意义吗！”
    ……
    又撞入了钱的困扰。钱从哪里来？钱到哪里去？是不是体制的阻隔、观念的僵化、愚昧造成的悲剧都能用钱来解释呢？看来这里更需要的是坚定的改革和探索。
