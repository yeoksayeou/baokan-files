Natural gas burns cleanly, has wide applications, and offers good economic benefits, making it an important high-quality energy source. Over the past 15 years, many countries have paid great attention to the exploration, development, and rational use of natural gas. Between 1979 and 1987, global natural gas consumption increased by 21.4%. In recent years, despite facing serious challenges from the sharp decline in oil prices, natural gas consumption has still shown significant growth. Between 1986 and 1987, global natural gas consumption increased by 4.6%, making it one of the fastest-growing primary energy sources.

Currently, there are 26 countries and regions with natural gas reserves exceeding 100 billion cubic meters, including China. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of natural gas reserves, production, consumption, and exports. The United States ranks second in production and consumption, West Germany is the largest importer of piped natural gas, and Japan remains the largest importer of liquefied natural gas. The consumption of natural gas in developing countries is also continuing to grow.

In recent years, the Soviet Union has formulated a new energy policy that emphasizes the use of natural gas to replace reduced oil production in the near future. The Soviet Union's natural gas production has increased for several consecutive years. In 1985, the production of natural gas, when converted to oil equivalent, already exceeded that of oil, with a ratio of 1:1.08. Due to the Soviet Union's efforts to develop natural gas, it is increasingly relying on natural gas. It is expected that by 1990, the structure of the Soviet Union's primary energy production will undergo significant changes, with the proportion of natural gas reaching 37.9%, making it the main energy source in the Soviet Union.

Due to the decline in global oil prices, the proportion of imported oil in the total oil consumption in the United States is expected to increase from 32% in 1986 to around 50% in 1990. This will have a significant impact on the United States' energy supply security and the rational use of domestic energy. Considering various factors such as energy supply security, the United States emphasizes the use of domestic natural gas to replace imported oil in its energy policy.

In recent years, there have been new breakthroughs in the exploration of natural gas resources worldwide. Soviet scientists have discovered unconventional natural gas, namely natural gas hydrates (solid natural gas), in the Okhotsk Sea, Black Sea, and the Sea of Japan. Recently, the United States and Canada announced the presence of massive natural gas hydrate reserves in their continental shelf regions. At the same time, advancements in natural gas exploration technology have provided conditions for extracting natural gas from tight rocks. All of these developments have expanded the world's natural gas resources and their geographical distribution. Some foreign scientists believe that the 21st century will be the era of significant natural gas development.

### 储量多　应用广　效益好  天然气饱含生机

　　储量多　应用广　效益好  
    天然气饱含生机
    天然气燃烧干净，应用广泛，经济效益好，是一种重要的优质能源。近１５年来，许多国家都极为重视对天然气的勘探、开发和合理利用。１９７９—１９８７年期间，世界天然气的消费量增长了２１．４％。近年来，尽管天然气遇到了来自石油价格暴跌的严重挑战，但消费量仍有较大的增长。１９８６—１９８７年期间世界天然气的消费量增长了４．６％，在一次性能源消费量中它是增长较多的一种。
    当前，天然气储量在１万亿立方米，产量１００亿立方米以上的国家和地区共有２６个，其中包括中国。苏联天然气的储量、产量、消费量和出口量均居世界第一位。美国的产量和消费量居第二位，西德是管道输送天然气的最大进口国，日本仍然是液化天然气的最大进口国。发展中国家天然气的消费量也在继续增长。
    近年来，苏联新制定的能源政策要求近期内大力用天然气来取代减产的石油。苏联天然气产量连续几年增产，按折算的油当量计算，１９８５年苏联天然气的产量已超过石油，石油与天然气产量的比值为１∶１．０８。由于苏联大力发展天然气，日益趋向于依靠天然气，预计１９９０年苏联一次性能源的生产构成将发生重大变化，天然气的比重将达到３７．９％，成为苏联的主要能源。
    由于世界石油价格下跌，进口石油在美国石油总消费量中占的比重将由１９８６年的３２％增加到１９９０年的５０％左右，这将对美国能源供给安全和合理利用国产能源产生巨大的冲击。美国出于对能源供给安全等各种因素的考虑，在其能源政策中强调用国产天然气来代替进口石油。
    近年来，世界各国在勘探天然气资源方面有新的突破。苏联科学家发现了非常规天然气，即天然气水化物（固体天然气），在鄂霍次克海、黑海和日本海等都取得天然气水化物岩心。不久前，美国和加拿大公布了在其大陆架地区有巨大的天然气水化物储量。同时，天然气勘探技术的进展，为开采致密岩中的天然气提供了条件。所有这些都扩大了世界天然气的资源及其地理分布。国外有些科学家认为，２１世纪将是天然气大发展的时代。
