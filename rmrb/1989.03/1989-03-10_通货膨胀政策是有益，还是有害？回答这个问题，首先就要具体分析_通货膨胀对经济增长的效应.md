To determine whether inflation policy is beneficial or harmful, we must first specifically analyze the impact of inflation on economic growth.

Zhang Shuguang, Yang Zhongwei

Inflation has both positive and negative effects on economic growth, and the actual outcome depends on various conditions and factors.

In Western market economies, under certain conditions, inflation can promote economic growth through two methods and three channels.

First, during inflation, wage increases lag behind price hikes, leading to two scenarios: one is the reduction of real wages, making the marginal benefit of labor greater than the marginal cost. This encourages enterprises to hire more labor, expand production, and gain more profits, resulting in increased employment and economic growth. The second scenario is the reduction of the wage share in total income and the increase of the non-wage income share, which can potentially raise the savings and investment rates, thereby promoting economic growth. This effect is long-term in nature.

Second, inflation itself is a change and adjustment of relative prices. In this process, the industries with the fastest price increases are precisely those that need further development and have strong expansion potential. Their expansion can lead to better resource allocation and more reasonable structural adjustments, thereby promoting economic growth.

However, it is important to note that the negative effects of inflation on economic growth are also evident, manifesting in several ways.

First, inflation increases the uncertainty and risk in economic decision-making, potentially leading to excessive purchasing and inventory accumulation by consumers and producers.

Second, while inflation allows for the adjustment of relative prices, it also causes price signals to quickly become outdated, reducing the value of information accumulation and making it easier for decision-makers to make incorrect adjustments, thereby increasing decision-making costs.

Third, inflation distorts interest rates, leading to a significant reduction or even negative real interest rates. This can result in excessive investment, causing already saturated markets to continue expanding production, leading to ineffective growth and resource waste.

Fourth, the high expectations brought by inflation can stimulate speculative activities, causing some financial assets to fall within the scope of speculation or to be invested in gold, antiques, and real estate for preservation rather than in human and production capital. This can suppress savings and investment, hindering economic growth.

Fifth, to control or absorb inflation, more factor inputs are needed, diverting scarce resources from the production sector to the inflation absorption sector. This is also a form of resource waste.

Clearly, inflation can have both positive and negative effects on economic growth, and the actual outcome depends on many specific conditions. An American scholar analyzed the relationship between inflation and economic growth in 56 countries (including 19 industrialized countries and 37 developing countries and regions) from 1950 to 1980, concluding that in 38 countries, inflation had a neutral effect on economic growth, in 16 countries it was harmful (distorting or reducing efficiency), and in 2 countries (Egypt and Uruguay) it had a stimulating effect. This analysis is authoritative.

In China, the proposals to "seek high-speed development through inflation" and "cure inflation with inflation" are extremely dangerous fantasies.

China's economy is not yet a market economy, and the ongoing reforms have introduced many unique features and complexities to the economic operation mechanisms, all of which will affect the growth effects of inflation. Some domestic scholars, focusing solely on the fact that inflation can increase savings and expand investment under certain conditions, advocate for an inflationary policy. They propose using fiscal overdrafts and loans to banks to accumulate funds for developing basic industries, aiming to suppress consumption, adjust structures, and fill material gaps. They even refer to this as "curing inflation with inflation." This proposal is, to a large extent, a dangerous fantasy.

First, to make inflation truly increase savings and accumulation, and expand investment and promote growth, one prerequisite is that wage and income growth must lag behind price increases. Otherwise, the following scenario may occur: on one hand, the state converts part of consumption expenditure into accumulation through fiscal overdrafts and loans to banks. On the other hand, due to wage and income growth outpacing price increases, the wage share in total income rises, while the tax share falls, leading to a decrease in savings and investment capacity. It should be noted that under China's current system, the state's ability and means to directly control wage and income growth have been significantly weakened, and enterprises lack the behavior of minimizing costs and the power to constrain wage growth. Under these conditions, implementing an inflationary policy is unlikely to achieve the goals of increasing savings and accumulation, expanding investment, and promoting economic growth. Some may argue that in recent years, China's inflation rate has not been low, yet the accumulation rate has increased. In fact, this is not sustainable. If inflation continues to worsen, and other conditions change accordingly, it is questionable whether resident savings can continue to grow abnormally. Savings behavior adjustment is a social learning process with a certain time lag. When inflation worsens and credit crises occur, panic buying for preservation becomes a collective behavior.

Second, to make the resource reallocation effect of inflation achieve the goal of promoting economic growth, it cannot be separated from the rational adjustment of relative prices. Otherwise, the opposite result may occur. First, resources may not truly flow to the sectors that need development, or they may flow more to other sectors, hindering structural adjustments. Because resource allocation is a fierce competition, changes in relative prices are the guiding and leveraging force of competition. Although the government can use administrative power to invest some resources in basic industries, if the prices of basic products and services cannot be raised or raised significantly, other resources that the central government cannot control will flow to sectors with relatively high or significantly increased prices. In recent years, despite the central government's repeated emphasis on strengthening energy and transportation construction, the investment proportion in the energy industry during the Sixth Five-Year Plan was still 0.5 percentage points lower than that during the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and the investment proportion in postal and transportation was only 0.4 percentage points higher than that during the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The combined result is that the Sixth Five-Year Plan's investment in these areas was still lower than that of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. Moreover, the long investment cycle of basic industries, which expands demand in the short term and increases supply in the long term, may further drive inflation, exacerbate shortages, widen the supply-demand gap in basic industries, and even cause the long-term goal of improving supply to fail.

Third, the negative effects of inflation on economic growth do not require very strict conditions and will not encounter significant obstacles. On the contrary, the positive effects of inflation on economic growth require a series of strict conditions, such as adjusting the relationship between wages and prices, making wage growth lag behind price increases, or making the prices of scarce sectors rise, changing relative prices, and guiding more reasonable structural adjustments, etc. This requires corresponding market conditions, a developed financial system, relatively high management capabilities, and more skillful policy operations. These conditions are either not yet met or not fully met. If we act rashly, we will not only fail to cure inflation but may further exacerbate it.

To compare and weigh the positive and negative effects of inflation on economic growth, we must conduct a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of inflation.

Since inflation has both positive and negative effects, there is a need to compare and weigh these effects. If we consider the positive effects as benefits and the negative effects as costs, this comparison and weighing is a cost-benefit analysis of inflation. Moreover, fighting against inflation or utilizing inflation also involves an effect issue, and it also requires the investment of certain factors and resources. Here, there is also a need for comparison and weighing, which is an important part of the cost-benefit analysis of inflation. Whether economic decisions should support or oppose inflation mainly depends on the above two cost-benefit analyses and their comparisons and weighings.

To conduct a cost-benefit analysis of inflation, we must first determine the positive effects or benefits brought by inflation, and second, determine the negative effects or costs of inflation. This includes not only the various expenses paid for implementing inflation and the resource consumption required for absorbing inflation but also the indirect losses caused by inflation, such as the losses from power outages, delayed construction periods, and inventory backlogs. If the benefits of inflation are greater than the expenses and indirect losses caused by inflation, it may be feasible to implement an inflationary policy; under the opposite conditions, an anti-inflation policy should be taken.

In discussing the economic growth effects of inflation, some comrades believe that inflation is an important lever for developing countries to escape low-income status and an important means to improve trade conditions and raise exchange rates. This not only involves the growth effects of inflation but also its development and international effects. However, this argument lacks further theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, while the opposite analysis and evidence are abundant. Improving income levels and trade conditions, raising exchange rates, and improving the position and methods of participating in international division of labor are two major challenges for developing countries on their path to modernization. The fundamental solution lies in improving economic quality and efficiency. Inflation increases the domestic production costs of export products, reducing competitiveness, and forces reliance on continuous devaluation-type adjustments. This artificially expands foreign demand, distorts the economic evaluation of export enterprises, impacts the domestic market, and is not conducive to the operation of foreign investments in China. At the same time, it can also trigger policy retaliation from neighboring countries. China's price system is already distorted, and Western countries use this as an excuse to implement discriminatory policies under the pretext of anti-dumping. If we implement an inflationary policy, we will give others a handle and weaken China's long-term international competitiveness. Therefore, relying on inflation not only cannot improve trade conditions and raise exchange rates but will further lead to the deterioration of trade conditions. Similarly, if economic efficiency and competitive quality cannot be improved, the increased income from inflation is equivalent to waste paper.

Some economic theorists, without fully examining the effects of inflation or conducting a cost-benefit analysis of inflation, rashly propose policies to implement inflation, which at least cannot be seen as a responsible act towards society. If such irresponsible policy suggestions are adopted without scientific analysis, it will have serious consequences.

Currently, China's economic system reform is at a critical stage of comprehensive deepening. Under the existing system framework, economic efficiency cannot be truly improved, and structural adjustments also face insurmountable difficulties. If inflation is used to stimulate economic growth, it can only act as a stimulant, doing more harm than good to the overall reform and development, or even causing harm without benefit. We must not, for the sake of a day's economic development, neglect the success or failure of the reform cause. This is also a historical balance that should not be overlooked or forgotten when weighing the pros and cons of inflation policy.

　　通货膨胀政策是有益，还是有害？回答这个问题，首先就要具体分析
    通货膨胀对经济增长的效应
    张曙光　杨仲伟
    通货膨胀对经济增长有正效应，也有负效应，其实际结果取决于多种情况和条件。
    在西方市场经济中，在一定条件下通货膨胀对经济增长能起某种促进作用，但这要借助以下两种方式通过三条途径来实现。
    第一，在发生通货膨胀情况下，工资的增长滞后于价格的上涨，这会产生以下两种情况：一是降低实际工资率，使劳动的边际效益大于边际成本，这样，企业就愿意雇用更多的劳动力，以扩大产量并获取更多的利润，结果会产生扩大就业与促进经济增长的效果。二是在总收入中，工资所占比重缩小，非工资收入比重增大，这又有可能使储蓄率、投资率提高，从而推动经济增长。这种效应具有长期性质。
    第二，通货膨胀本身就是相对价格的变动和调整。在这种变动和调整中，价格相对提高最快的行业正是需要进一步发展的行业，这也是具有强大扩张动力的行业，它的扩张会使资源得到较好的配置，使结构得到比较合理的调整，从而促进经济增长。
    但是，必须看到，通货膨胀对经济增长的负效应也是很明显的，这有多方面的表现。
    第一，通货膨胀增加了经济主体决策的不确定性和风险，有可能引起消费者和生产者的过度购买和过度存货；
    第二，通货膨胀一方面使相对价格得以调整，但同时又使价格信号迅速老化，降低了信息积累的价值，使人们易于作出错误的调整决策，从而增加了决策成本；
    第三，通货膨胀使利率扭曲，出现实际利率降低过大甚至为负的情况，这就可能形成过度投资，使得市场已经饱和的部门仍继续扩大生产，进而造成无效增长和资源浪费；
    第四，通货膨胀带来的期望很高，会刺激投机活动，使一部分金融资产处于投机范围，或者为保值而投入黄金、古玩、房地产，而不投入人力资本和生产资本。这又会抑制储蓄和投资，阻碍经济增长；
    第五，为了治理或吸纳通货膨胀，需要增加更多的要素投入，从而把稀缺的资源从生产领域转入吸纳通货膨胀领域。这也是一种资源浪费。
    可见，通货膨胀对经济增长既可能起促进的正效应，又可能起抑制的负效应，其效应的实际结果则取决于很多具体情况和具体条件。美国学者曾对５６个国家（其中１９个工业国家和３７个发展中国家和地区）１９５０—１９８０年间通货膨胀与经济增长之间的关系，进行了统计分析和相关检验，得出的结论是：３８个国家通货膨胀对经济增长的作用是中性的，１６个国家是有害的（扭曲或降低效率），２个国家（埃及和乌拉圭）有刺激作用。这个分析是有一定权威性的。
    在我国，“以通货膨胀来谋求高速发展”、“以通货膨胀来医治通货膨胀”的主张，是一种十分危险的空想。
    我国经济目前还不是市场经济，改革的进行使得经济运行的方式和机制出现很多特点和复杂性，这都会对通货膨胀的增长效应产生影响。国内有的学者仅仅抓住通货膨胀在一定条件下有增加储蓄和扩大投资的作用，就主张采用通货膨胀政策，用财政向银行透支和借款的办法，为发展基础产业积累资金，以达到抑制消费、调整结构、弥补物资缺口的目的，而且将其称之为“以通货膨胀来医治通货膨胀”。这种主张在很大程度上是一种十分危险的空想。
    第一，要使通货膨胀真正达到增加储蓄和积累，扩大投资和促进增长的效应，前提条件之一就是必须使工资和收入的增长低于价格的上涨，否则就会出现这样的结果：从一个方面来看，国家通过财政向银行透支和借款，把一部分消费支出转向积累，但是从另一方面来看，由于工资和收入增长快于价格上涨，造成总收入中工资所占比重上升，利税所占比重下降，从而使储蓄和投资能力下降。应该看到，在我国目前的体制结构下，国家直接控制工资收入增长的能力和手段已大大削弱，企业又无成本最小化行为和制约工资增长的力量。在这种条件下，执行通货膨胀政策的结果，很难实现储蓄和积累增加、投资扩大和经济增长的目的。也许有人会提出问题说，近几年我国通货膨胀率不低，而积累率反而有所提高。其实，这是难以持久的。如果通货膨胀继续加剧，相应地其他条件也发生变化，能否继续保持居民储蓄的超常增长，还是个很大的问题。储蓄行为的调整是一个社会的学习过程，有一定的时滞。当通货膨胀加剧和出现信用危机时，抢购保值行为便成为社会共识的集体行为。
    第二，要使通货膨胀重新配置资源的效应达到促进经济增长的目标，离不开相对价格的合理调整。否则就会产生相反的结果。首先是资源不能真正流向需要发展的部门，或者流向其他部门的更多，结构调整就会受阻。因为资源配置是一场激烈的竞争，相对价格的变化就是竞争的导向和杠杆。尽管政府可以凭借行政权力把一部分资源投入基础产业，但是，如果基础产品和服务价格不能提高，或提高不多，其他中央政府控制不了的资源就会流向相对价格较高或提高较多的部门。近几年来，尽管中央三令五申加强能源交通建设，但“六五”时期能源工业投资的比重仍低于“五五”时期０．５个百分点，邮电交通投资比重只比“五五”时期上升了０．４个百分点，二者合计，“六五”比“五五”还是下降了。不仅如此，基础产业投资周期较长产生的短期扩大需求和长期增加供给的特点，还有可能进一步推动通货膨胀，加剧短缺，扩大基础产业的供需差距，甚至会使长期改善供给的目标落空。
    第三，通货膨胀对于经济增长的负效应，其实现并不需要十分严格的条件，不会遇到太大的阻碍。与此相反，通货膨胀对经济增长的正效应，其实现则需要一系列严格的条件，如调整工资和价格的关系，使工资增长滞后于物价上涨，或使短缺部门价格上涨，改变相对价格，引向比较合理的结构调整，等等。这就需要有相应的市场条件，需要有发达的金融体系，需要有较高的管理能力和比较巧妙的政策操作。这些条件我们目前都还不具备，或者不完全具备。如果贸然行动，不仅不能医治通货膨胀，反而会使通货膨胀更进一步加剧。
    为了比较和权衡通货膨胀对经济增长的正负效应，就要对通货膨胀作出全面的成本效益分析。
    通货膨胀既然有正效应，也有负效应，就存在一个正负效应的比较和权衡的问题。如果把正效应看作效益，负效应看作成本，这样的比较和权衡就是通货膨胀的成本效益分析。不仅如此，与通货膨胀作斗争或者利用通货膨胀也有一个效应问题，而且也需要投入一定的要素和资源，这里也存在着一个比较和权衡的问题，这也是通货膨胀的成本效益分析的一个重要内容。经济决策究竟应支持还是反对通货膨胀，主要取决于以上两个成本效益分析，进行比较和权衡。
    进行通货膨胀的成本效益分析，一要确定通货膨胀带来的正效应或效益，二要确定通货膨胀的负效应或成本，它不仅包括实行通货膨胀所支付的各种费用和吸纳通货膨胀所需要的资源消耗，而且包括通货膨胀造成的间接损失，如拉闸限电的损失、工期拖长的损失、库存积压的损失等。如果通货膨胀的效益大于通货膨胀的费用和间接损失，也许实行通货膨胀政策是可行的；在相反条件下，则应该取反通货膨胀的政策。
    在讨论通货膨胀的经济增长效应时，有同志认为，通货膨胀是发展中国家摆脱低收入状态的重要杠杆，是改善贸易条件、提高汇率水平的重要手段。这不仅涉及通货膨胀的增长效应，而且涉及它的发展效应和国际效应。但这种说法并未提出进一步的理论分析和经验证据，相反的分析和证据则是大量的。提高收入水平与改善贸易条件，提高汇率水平，改善参与国际分工的地位和方式，是发展中国家走向现代化进程中的两大难题。解决的根本途径在于提高经济的质量效率。通货膨胀使国内出口产品成本提高，竞争能力降低，只好乞灵于不断进行汇率降低型调整，它人为扩大国外需求，扭曲出口企业的经济评价，造成对国内市场的冲击，也不利于外商在华投资的经营。同时，它还会引起邻国的政策性报复。我国的价格体系本来就是扭曲的，西方国家以此为由，以反倾销为借口实行歧视性政策，如果我们再搞通货膨胀政策，就会授人以柄，削弱我国经济的长期国际竞争能力。因此，靠通货膨胀不仅不能改善贸易条件，提高汇率水平，而且会进一步导致贸易条件恶化。同样，如果不能提高经济效率和竞争质量，靠通货膨胀增加的收入也等于废纸。
    一些经济理论工作者既不全面考察通货膨胀的效应问题，也不进行通货膨胀的成本效益分析，就贸然提出实行通货膨胀的政策建议，这至少不能看作是对社会负责的表现。如果在没有得到有科学根据的分析结果之前，就采纳这种不负责任的政策建议，就会造成相当严重的后果。
    目前，我国的经济体制改革正处在全面深化的关键时期。在现行体制框架下，经济效率难以真正提高，结构调整也有无法克服的困难，如果用通货膨胀来刺激经济增长，只能起到一种强心针的作用，对整个改革与发展害多利少，甚至有害无利。我们切不可因争经济发展一日之长短而置改革大业的成败于不顾。这也是权衡通货膨胀政策之利弊时不应忽视和忘记的历史大天平。
