Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, March 1st.

After the Lantern Festival, Hangzhou residents, holding various New Year supply tickets, lined up to buy their share of New Year goods.

To ensure that the people have a good Spring Festival, the municipal government used fiscal subsidies to prepare various marine products and increased the supply of meat, eggs, and tofu. However, residents seemed less enthusiastic about the tickets. Half a month after the Spring Festival, only about one-quarter of the tickets were redeemed.

Some customers frankly said: The things given by the units during the Spring Festival are more than enough to eat. If the tickets were not about to expire, they could come to buy them in ten days or half a month. A responsible person from the city's commercial system sighed: To have a good Spring Festival, from the government to the units to the people, everyone thinks about how to ensure a good meal, to the point of wasting food. We should change this "eating" trend.

    杭州市民有“口福”过了元宵买年货
    据新华社杭州3月1日电　（实习生汪中国、记者林楠）元宵节之后，杭州群众手持各种春节供应票证，排起长队，购买属于他们的那份年货。
    为了使群众过好春节，市政府用财政补贴准备了各种海水产，增加了肉、蛋、豆制品的供应量。可是居民似乎对票证不那么热情。春节过了半个月后，票证只回收了1／4左右。
    一些顾客直言不讳地说：春节单位发的东西都吃不完。如果不是票证要作废再过十天半月来买也可以。市商业系统一位负责人感慨地说：为过好春节，从政府到单位到群众，想到的都是如何保证吃好，以至出现浪费，应该改改这种“吃”的风气。
