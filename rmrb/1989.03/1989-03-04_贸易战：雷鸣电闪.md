The economies of North America, Western Europe, and East Asia, including Japan, experienced an unexpectedly robust growth in 1988. In 1989, these regions are continuing their growth momentum. If the major industrialized countries do not make significant policy errors, the Western economies are likely to remain relatively stable this year. However, beneath this surface calm, dangerous undercurrents lurk: a trade war could erupt at any moment between the United States, Japan, and Western Europe.

Last year, the United States and Canada signed a regional free trade agreement, and the European Community (EC) countries accelerated their efforts to establish a unified European market by 1992. Japan, the world's largest trade surplus country, heavily relies on the U.S. and Western European markets. South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan Province export 35% to 40% of their goods to the United States. These four countries and regions trade approximately $40 billion annually with the EC. The rise of protectionism in North America and Western Europe poses a serious threat to East Asian countries and regions. Therefore, the idea of forming a trade bloc on the Pacific's western coast is gaining traction.

In 1988, the U.S. trade deficit improved, primarily due to the continuous depreciation of the dollar over three years. To further improve the trade balance in the next two years, the U.S. needs to increase exports. However, the current industrial capacity utilization rate in the U.S. is near saturation, making it challenging to increase exports and reduce the trade deficit to the desired level of $100 billion. This situation makes U.S. trade policy more assertive. The EC, with a population equivalent to that of the U.S. and Japan combined, accounts for 40% of global exports, making it the world's largest market. Last year, bilateral trade between the U.S. and the EC reached $145 billion, while Japan's trade surplus with the EC was $20 billion. Therefore, any move in the EC's trade policy attracts significant attention. Currently, the most concerning issue for the outside world is the EC's new slogan of "reciprocity" in international trade, which implies that countries benefiting from the EC's expanded unified market must also provide equal market access to the EC. Due to the vast differences in market management systems and regulations among countries, determining whether equal market access has been achieved is often difficult, leading to new disputes.

The rising protectionism within the U.S. and the EC makes Japan anxious. In recent years, to avoid international backlash, the Japanese government has allowed the yen to appreciate significantly and has worked to stimulate domestic demand and encourage imports. Despite these efforts, Japan's trade surplus, except for a slight slowdown in 1987, has not decreased in recent years. Moreover, since the second half of last year, it has shown a strong upward trend. This situation forces the U.S. and the EC to resort to protectionism to defend their positions and strike back at Japan. Although the Japanese Ministry of Finance predicts that Japan's trade surplus will decrease from $94.7 billion in 1988 to $88 billion in 1989, private institutions generally believe that Japan's trade surplus will surpass the $100 billion mark. This means that Japan's trade offensive this year will further exacerbate serious international trade friction.

It is well known that trade wars only bring disaster. This is especially true in today's interconnected global economy. Solving market conflicts without resorting to war seems to be no easy task.

　　贸易战：雷鸣电闪
    张振亚
    北美、西欧继日本和东亚地区的经济在去年出乎意料的兴旺之后，１９８９年继续保持着增长势头。假若主要工业国家的经济政策不出现重大差错，今年西方经济很可能相对平稳。不过在表面平静的底层仍然埋藏着危险的暗流：美国、日本、西欧之间随时可能爆发贸易战。
    去年，美国和加拿大签订了地区性的自由贸易协定，欧共体国家又加快步伐，争取在１９９２年建成统一的欧洲市场。日本是世界最大贸易出超国，对美国、西欧的市场依赖甚大。南朝鲜、新加坡、香港和我国台湾省的３５％到４０％的出口输往美国，这四个国家和地区每年同欧共体的贸易金额，高达４００亿美元。贸易保护主义在北美和西欧抬头，必然给东亚国家和地区带来严重威胁。因此，在太平洋西岸建立贸易集团的想法也正在抬头。
    １９８８年美国的外贸逆差有所改善，这主要是美元汇价连续３年下跌的结果。今明两年外贸如要进一步改善，就需要进一步增加出口。可是美国的工业开工率目前已近饱和状态，要增加出口，使外贸逆差再降到所期望的１０００亿美元以下，真是困难重重。这就使美国的外贸政策不得不更趋强硬。欧洲共同体的人口等于美国加日本，在全世界出口贸易中的比重为４０％，是世界最大的市场。去年，美国和共同体的双向贸易高达１４５０亿美元，日本对共同体的出超为２００亿美元，因此，共同体贸易政策上的一举一动，都受到各方注意。目前，最引起外部世界不安的是共同体又提出了在国际贸易中要推行彼此“对等”原则的新口号，其大意是今后凡从共同体扩大了的统一市场中得到贸易好处的国家，也必须为共同体提供同等程度的市场开放。由于各国市场管理的体制和法规千差万别，彼此是否达到同等市场开放往往很难裁决，这就引发新的争吵。
    美国和欧洲共同体内贸易保护主义的日益抬头使日本感到害怕。几年来，为避免外界的群起而攻，日本政府除容忍日元大幅度升值外，还努力刺激国内需求，并在鼓励进口上做出种种姿态。尽管如此，日本的外贸出超除了在１９８７年上升幅度略有减缓，这几年从未出现真正减少。不但如此，从去年下半年起，又出现了咄咄逼人的上升趋势。这一形势逼得美国和欧洲共同体借助保护主义牢守阵地，打击日本。尽管日本大藏省预言今年日本的外贸出超可能从去年的９４７亿美元下降到８８０亿美元，但日本私人机构普遍认为，日本的外贸出超会进一步突破１０００亿美元大关。这就是说，日本的外贸攻势今年将使严重的国际贸易摩擦进一步加剧。
    众所周知，贸易战只会招致灾难。在全球经济紧密结合的今天更是如此。要在不启战端的前提下解决市场矛盾，看来并非易事。
