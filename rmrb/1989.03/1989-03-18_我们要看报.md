	We Want to Read Newspapers

	Previously, our school subscribed to 8 newspapers for each class: two copies of People's Daily, two copies of Reference News, one copy each of Shenyang Daily, China Youth Daily, Sports Daily, and Liaoning Daily. We could keep up with domestic and international news every day. Newspapers became our close companions, and many students would read the newspaper as soon as they finished dinner.

	This year, due to the increase in newspaper prices, the school reduced the number of subscriptions. As a result, each class now only gets Liaoning Daily and Reference News. Students felt a sense of information deprivation.

	In the past, our school library had various reading rooms with newspapers like People's Daily and Guangming Daily, making it very convenient for us to read. However, now our school library, except for the newspaper reading room, has removed newspapers from other reading rooms. Although each department has a resource room with newspapers, due to limited opening hours and small space, especially being far from the study rooms, students rarely go there. Consequently, many students who enjoy reading People's Daily, Guangming Daily, China Youth Daily, and China Sports Daily find it difficult to access them.

	I believe that a school is a place for nurturing individuals and should educate students to care about domestic and international affairs. Currently, educational funds are indeed tight, but to create a good learning environment for students and broaden their horizons, I hope the school can adjust the students' book and newspaper fee expenditures and restore the original number of newspaper subscriptions.

### 我们要看报

　　我们要看报
    以前我校每个班级订有８份报纸：两份人民日报、两份参考消息，沈阳日报、中国青年报、体育报、辽宁日报各１份。我们每天都可以及时了解国内外大事。报纸成了同学们的亲密伙伴，不少同学每天吃完晚饭的第一件事就是看报。
    今年初，因报价调高，学校减少了订报。于是，一个班只有给订了辽宁日报和参考消息。同学们感到了消息了闭塞所带来的一种信息饥渴。
    过去，我校图书馆的各个阅览室都有人民日报、光明日报等，我们读报十分方便。可是，现在我校图书馆除了报刊阅览室外，其它阅览室都撤掉了报刊。虽然各系资料室都有报纸，但因开放时间限制，加上地方小，特别是离自习室远，同学们很少去。这样一来，大多数同学爱看的人民日报、光明日报、中国青年报、中国体育报等，就很难看到了。
    我认为，学校是个培育人的地方，应教育学生关心国内外大事。眼下，教育经费确实比较紧张，但为了给学生们创造一个良好的学习环境，扩大学生们的视野，希望校方尽可能调整一下学生的书报费开支，恢复原有订报数字。
