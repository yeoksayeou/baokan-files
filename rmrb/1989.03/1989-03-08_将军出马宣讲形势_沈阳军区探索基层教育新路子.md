Over 70 generals from the Shenyang Military Region have recently visited grassroots units to discuss the current situation and have found that improving the local environment is a catalyst for in-depth situation education.

Currently, some comrades often complain about the poor social atmosphere and the bad overall environment when discussing situation education.

These generals, during a situation education symposium held recently by the military region, believe that the overall environment and the local environment are interdependent and influence each other. For instance, a certain warehouse is located in a remote and harsh area, but the five college graduates assigned there are quite content. The reason is that the atmosphere there is good, affairs are handled fairly, and it provides excellent conditions for the college graduates to develop. Conducting situation education here is easily accepted. However, in a certain platoon, the political instructor talks every day about reform, party discipline, military discipline, and combating corruption. Yet, when soldiers bring him gifts from home, he accepts them without hesitation. Someone metaphorically described his place as having "unshakable rocks and lingering smoke." How can the soldiers not feel disheartened when he talks about the situation?

　　将军出马宣讲形势
    沈阳军区探索基层教育新路子
    据新华社沈阳３月７日电  （中央电台记者王兴功、新华社记者李月柱）沈阳军区７０多位将军深入基层宣讲形势后感到，优化小环境是形势教育深入的催化剂。
    现在有些同志一讲形势教育，总是埋怨社会风气差，大环境不好。
    这些将军们近日在军区召开的形势教育座谈会上认为，大环境同小环境是相互影响，相互制约的。某仓库驻在艰苦的边远地区，但分到那里工作的五个大学生却很安心。原因在于那里的风气好，办事公道，为大学生成才提供了良好条件。在这里进行形势教育就容易被接受。而有个连队，指导员天天在那里讲改革，讲党风军风，讲克服腐败现象，可战士探家给他的东西，他照收不误。有人形象地说他那里常常是“石林不倒，云烟不散”。他讲形势，战士怎么能不心灰意冷呢？
