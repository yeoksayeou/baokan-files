Seoul subway workers, numbering around 4,000, went on a total strike early on the 16th, paralyzing the subway system that handles 2.4 million passengers daily.

With thousands of passengers forced to take buses and taxis, Seoul's traffic became chaotic.

According to reports, the main cause of the strike is the deteriorating labor-management relations. Due to severe losses last year, the management refused to honor the agreement reached with the union, sparking strong discontent among the workers. The subway workers demanded the resignation of the general manager, the fulfillment of the agreement, and the cessation of suppression against the workers. Although the Seoul municipal government intervened, the talks broke down because the management refused to sign the new "agreement" and provide guarantees.

South Korean "Prime Minister" Kang Young-hoon ordered relevant departments in Seoul to take "emergency transportation" measures to counter the subway strike. Currently, the authorities have deployed 15,000 police to suppress the strike, and over 2,800 strikers have been arrested.

　　汉城地铁职工总罢工
    南朝鲜“国务总理”下令对抗
    本报平壤３月１７日电  记者徐宝康报道：汉城消息，南朝鲜汉城地铁职工４０００多人，１６日凌晨举行总罢工，使日均客运量达２４０万的地铁交通处于瘫痪。
    在成千上万的旅客改乘公共汽车和出租车的情况下，汉城交通呈现一片混乱。
    据报道，此次罢工的主要原因是劳资关系恶化。由于汉城地铁去年亏损严重，资方拒绝履行去年同工会达成的协议，激起职工强烈不满。地铁职工强烈要求，地铁公司总经理辞职，履行协议，并停止对职工的镇压。尽管汉城市政当局出面从中斡旋，但由于资方拒不在新“协议”上签字和作出保证，劳资谈判终告破裂。
    南朝鲜“国务总理”姜英勋昨天下令汉城有关部门，采取“非常运输”措施，以对抗地铁罢工。目前，当局已出动１．５万名警察镇压罢工，２８００多罢工人员被捕。
