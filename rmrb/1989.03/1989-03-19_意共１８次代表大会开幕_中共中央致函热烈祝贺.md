To the 18th National Congress of the Italian Communist Party, dear comrades:

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, extends warm congratulations and sincere respect to the 18th National Congress of the Italian Communist Party.

The Italian Communist Party, with its glorious struggle tradition, has long adhered to independence and self-reliance, based on the actual situation in its country, and united all democratic and progressive forces to maintain national independence, promote democratic reforms, and advance social progress. It has conducted unyielding and courageous struggles, playing an important role in Italian political life. Today, Italian communists, in response to the changing situation, are seriously seeking new strategies, striving to strengthen the party's own construction with a spirit of innovation, and are determined to overcome various difficulties on the road ahead to open a new phase of democratic reform and the struggle for socialism. We sincerely wish for the continuous progress of your just cause.

The Italian Communist Party has raised the banner of peace and disarmament, striving to promote the easing of international tensions, resolutely opposing the arms race and the dangers of war, condemning any unjust and unjustifiable actions of the strong bullying the weak, the rich oppressing the poor, and the powerful subduing the weak. It has made active efforts to establish a new international order of justice, becoming a strong force in maintaining world peace and promoting human progress.

The Chinese and Italian Communist Parties have a traditional friendship and a good cooperative relationship. We both handle party-to-party relations according to the correct principles of independence and self-reliance, complete equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. We believe that, on this basis, the close friendship and cooperative relationship between the Chinese and Italian Communist Parties will continue to deepen and develop, thereby making new contributions to promoting friendship and cooperation between China and Italy and their peoples, to maintaining world peace, to establishing a new international political and economic order, and to promoting social progress and development.

We wish the 18th National Congress of the Italian Communist Party a complete success.

Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
