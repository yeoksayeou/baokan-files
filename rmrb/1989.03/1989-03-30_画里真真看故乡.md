Zhejiang is renowned for its mountains and rivers, and Shaoxing has long been celebrated for its beauty. The hills are like paintings, and the mountain ranges stretch on endlessly; the plains are like embroidery, and the waterways crisscross. That vast expanse of cloudy water is either tenderly affectionate or gently gazing, or murmuring softly, or vast and boundless. It truly is a place where "clouds and water are a thousand layers deep, and one is amidst a thousand layers of clouds and water." As early as the Jin Dynasty, Gu Kaizhi, with the eye of a great painter, praised the beauty of the mountains and rivers of Kuiqi: "Thousands of peaks vie for beauty, ten thousand valleys compete in flow, grass and trees cover the top, like clouds rising and red clouds spreading." The great calligrapher Wang Xianzhi also highly praised it: "Traveling from the mountains of Shanyin, the mountains and rivers reflect each other, making one unable to respond quickly enough." West Lake is known as a paradise, but before the Six Dynasties, its fame was far less than that of Yue Prefecture.

Shaoxing is a historic city, with time flowing slowly, and the land changing with the years. Although the city walls have been renewed and changed day by day, the scenery remains unchanged, retaining its ancient charm. The majestic Great Yu Mausoleum at the foot of Mount Kuiqi, the sturdy King Yue Platform at the foot of Longshan, the Ifye Stream where Goujian smelted and forged swords, the Qinwang Hill where the Qin King traveled east to see the sea, the Autumn Temple and Changtang in the south of the city, and the Zhou Enlai ancestral residence, Baishu Tang in the city, will make visitors feel a sense of reverence, like a burning incense, from ancient times to the present.

The clear waters and Kuiqi Mountain are blessed with talent, and have always been a place where many scholars gather. Outstanding academic and artistic achievements are renowned throughout the world; legendary stories that move the ages, traces can be found everywhere. Wang Xizhi's retreat, Jiezhu Temple, the bridge where an old woman sold fans and wrote on them, the stream where Lan Ting held the purification ceremony, the garden where Lu You lamented "Pinzhen Feng," the Qingting Book House of Xu Wei, the Hundred Grass Garden of Lu Xun, all make one linger and be captivated. Goujian's strategy against Wu once used a not entirely upright and honest beauty tactic. Before being sent to King Wu, Xishi, who came from a poor family, built an earthen platform, tried on silk, and learned singing and dancing. Li Bai has a poem "Viewing Ancient Sites in Yue" expressing the sentiment of rise and fall: "King Goujian of Yue defeated Wu and returned, the loyal knights returned home in brocade, the palace ladies were like flowers filling the spring palace, now only the quails fly." The Xishi Platform now only remains a mound of yellow earth, facing the vast sky, but it is enough to make visitors feel moved and reflect on the past and present.

Many famous names in the literary world have had connections with Shaoxing. Sima Qian, Cai Yong, Ji Kang, Li Bai, Du Fu, Meng Haoran, Yuan Zhen, Fan Zhongyan, Wang Anshi, Su Dongpo, Xin Qiji... all left traces of their travels and famous poems and essays. After the May Fourth Movement, Lu Xun deeply depicted the customs and people of Shaoxing; the name of the Hengsheng Wine Shop became famous; Xu Zhimo wrote many famous works about his hometown; the famous work "Dragon Mountain Dream Remains" by Xu Yinan and Wang Shiying, with a preface by Liu Daibai, is a beautiful essay dedicated to the scenery of Shaoxing. People are known through places, places are known through people, people are known through literature, and literature is known through people. The ancient city of Shaoxing is experiencing a new era, and the long history and cultural traditions have been properly valued and respected.

The "Shaoxing" album published by Zhejiang Fine Arts Publishing House is a product of modern science. Photography has become a specialized subject. The photographer's skills not only achieve true-to-life paintings but also can capture the essence and spirit of the subject. It is hoped that this exquisite album will allow readers to enjoy a virtual tour and recognize the past and present appearance of the ancient city of Shaoxing.

　　画里真真看故乡
    浙江多名山胜水，绍兴自古为世所艳称。丘陵如画，山脉连绵；平原如绣，水网交织。那一片澄明如镜的云水乡，或脉脉含情，或盈盈若睇，或淙淙细语，或浩浩无边，真的是“云千重，水千重，身在千重云水中。”早在晋代，顾恺之用大画家的眼光，盛赞会稽山川之美：“千岩竞秀，万壑争流，草木蒙笼其上，若云兴霞蔚。”大书法家王献之也极口称道：“从山阴道上行，山川自相映发，使人应接不暇。”西湖号称天堂，六朝以前，声名却远不如越州之盛。
    绍兴是历史名城，岁月悠悠，复疆载土，尽管城廓更新，日迁月异，而风景依旧，不减古色古香。会稽山麓峨巍的大禹陵，龙山脚下苍劲的越王台，勾践冶金铸剑的若耶溪，秦王东巡望海的秦望山，城南的秋瑾故宅和畅堂，城中的周恩来祖居百岁堂，会把游人的高山仰止之情，像一瓣心香，一路燃烧，从远古直到现代。
    镜水稽山，钟灵毓秀，自来济济多士，卓越的学术和艺术成就，名垂宇宙；歆动千古的逸闻韵事，踪迹历历可寻。王羲之的别业戒珠寺，为卖扇老妪书扇的题扇桥，兰亭修禊的流觞曲水，陆游悲吟《钗头凤》的沈园池台，徐渭的青藤书屋，鲁迅的百草园，在在使人流连，目迷心醉。勾践沼吴，曾用过不够光明磊落的美人计，出身贫家的西施被选送吴王以前，曾经筑土台，试罗绮，学歌舞。李白有《越中览古》一诗，抒苍桑兴衰之感：“越王勾践破吴归，义士还家尽锦衣，宫女如花满春殿，只今惟有鹧鸪飞。”西施台现在只剩得黄土一丘，独对长空，却也足供游客回肠荡气，怀古思今。
    历代文苑馨香的姓氏，不少和绍兴有过因缘，司马迁、蔡邕、嵇康、李白、杜甫、孟浩然、元稹、范仲淹、王安石、苏东坡、辛弃疾……都留下了萍踪浪迹，诗文名篇。“五四”以后，鲁迅深刻地描画了绍兴的风土人情，咸亨酒店已成为一景；周作人写了许多故乡的名物，乌篷船由此知名；徐蔚南、王世颖合著，刘大白作序的《龙山梦痕》，是专为绍兴风景写照的美文。人以地传，地以人传，人以文传，文以人传。绍兴古城正经历着一个新的时代，悠久的历史传统和文化传统，得到了应有的珍视和重视。
    浙江美术出版社编印的《绍兴》画册是现代科学的产物，摄影艺术已成为一门专门的学问。摄影家的手腕不但能达到画里真真，更能心裁物象，传神摄髓。愿这一精致的画册，能供读者卧游，认取古城绍兴的今昔容颜。
