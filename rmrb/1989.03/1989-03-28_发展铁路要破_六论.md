If transportation does not develop, the national economy cannot develop either. If railway transportation does not develop, other forms of transportation cannot develop either. What is the problem with railways? I believe the key issue is the word "less." In the 20 years before the founding of the nation, 1,000 kilometers of railway lines were added each year, which could barely meet the needs of the national economy's development. However, after the Third Plenum, the national economy developed rapidly, but our railway construction slowed down, with only 300 to 400 kilometers added each year. This is completely abnormal and is influenced by some erroneous and distorted theories. Specifically, there are "three theories" externally and "three theories" within the Ministry of Railways:

External "Three Theories":

1. The theory that railway industry is a sunset industry. Looking at the tight situation of railways in recent years, this theory is self-defeating.

2. The theory of adjusting the structure. It is believed that the current tight situation in railway transportation is due to an irrational structure, and adjusting the transportation structure can solve the problem. We do not oppose adjusting the transportation structure, but if we follow economic laws, we should first adjust the railways. Otherwise, it would be against the national conditions and objective economic laws.

3. The theory of reorganizing the management structure. Many foreign countries do have transportation departments, but most of them were established after the formation of the transportation network, which is completely different from our national conditions. In the 1970s, we merged the departments, but three years later, we separated them again, and there have been failed lessons.

Internal "Three Theories":

1. The theory of investment ratio imbalance. This theory believes that in the past 30 years, too many new lines were built, and the renovation of old lines was not given enough attention. Now, it should be reversed. This theory is unreasonable because before 1980, all major repairs and depreciation fees of railways were handed over to the state, and the funds for updating and renovation were squeezed from railway construction, which is not an imbalance but a reverse imbalance. Now, it is not normal to maintain simple reproduction by digging into expanded reproduction.

2. The theory that new lines lose money. This theory believes that building a new line results in a loss. Railways are infrastructure, and social benefits come first. After the railways are built, the cargo source is not immediately large but gradually attracts more.

3. The theory of focusing on internal potential. This theory believes that potential can solve the problem, such as increasing the electrification coverage rate. In fact, this is obviously not feasible.

Why has railway work not improved? It is because the guiding ideology is not clear.

I believe the best guiding principle for railway work is the "four in all directions, smooth and unobstructed, safe and punctual, and lead the way" sixteen-character policy proposed in the 9th document when Deng Xiaoping oversaw industrial and transportation work in 1975.

### 发展铁路要破“六论”

　　发展铁路要破“六论”
    谭葆宪（铁道部科技顾问、中国科协委员）：交通运输上不去，国民经济也上不去，铁路运输上不去，其它运输也上不去。铁路的问题在哪？我认为关键的问题是一个“少”字。建国前２０年，每年线路增加１０００公里，勉强能适应国民经济的发展。而到三中全会以后，国家的经济大发展了，我们却下来了，每年修三四百公里，这是完全不正常的，是有一种错误、歪曲的理论在影响着。具体地讲，外部有“三论”，铁道部内部也有“三论”：
    外部“三论”：
    ⒈说铁路工业是夕阳工业。看看近几年来的铁路的紧张状况，这种理论不攻自破。
    ⒉调整结构论。认为目前铁路运输紧张，是因为结构不合理，调整运输结构就可以解决问题。调整运输结构我们不反对，但如果按经济规律办事，就首先应该把铁路调整上去，否则就是违反国情、违反客观经济规律。
    ⒊改组管理机构论。国外许多国家的确有运输部，但大部分国家都是在形成运输网以后才成立的，和我们国家的国情完全不同。七十年代我们就合并过，三年之后又分开了，已经有了失败的教训。
    内部“三论”：
    ⒈投资比例失调论。这种理论认为，过去３０年新线修多了，老线的改造没有给予足够的重视，现在应该反过来。这种理论毫无道理，因为１９８０年以前，铁路大修、折旧费全部上缴国家，用于更新改造的资金是从铁路基本建设中挤出来的，不是比例失调，而是反比例失调。现在是维持简单再生产挖扩大再生产的墙脚，这是不正常的。
    ⒉新线赔钱论。这种理论认为，新线修一条赔一条。铁路是基础设施，社会效益是第一位的，铁路修好后，货源不是马上就很大，而是慢慢吸引。
    ⒊唯内涵论。这种理论认为，挖潜就可以解决问题，比如提高电化覆盖率等。事实上这是显然不行的。
    铁路工作为什么一直上不去呢？就是因为指导思想不明确。
    我认为指导铁路工作最好的就是１９７５年邓小平同志主持工交工作时发的９号文件中提出的“四通八达，畅通无阻，安全正点，当好先行”十六字方针。
