This spring, a soldier in a certain unit who was about to be discharged carried a grenade into a ravine, intending to commit suicide because he had not joined the party and feared he would not be able to face his parents. Fortunately, he was discovered, preventing a tragedy. Although this is an isolated incident, it reflects a problem worth noting.

Military families hope that their children will achieve merit, join the party, and be promoted while serving in the military. This is a beautiful wish. Whether in wartime or peacetime, the expectations of relatives have always been a powerful support for soldiers' progress and military construction. However, now, this beautiful wish sometimes becomes a soldier's burden and a difficult point in military work.

"Definitely achieve merit before coming back!" "Definitely join the party before coming back!" "Definitely be promoted before coming back!" Many soldiers receive such letters from home. An officer said, "These rigid quotas are like heavy stones pressing on the soldiers' hearts, seriously affecting their healthy growth."

Parents' hopes for their children to become successful are most concentrated on the issue of joining the party. In a certain unit of the People's Armed Police, 75% of the soldiers who enlisted this year wrote applications to join the party. According to a survey, some of these soldiers who wrote applications to join the party did not do so out of their own will, but under family pressure. A soldier in a certain artillery unit had only been in the army for half a year but had already written six applications to join the party. He often begged party members to introduce him to the party. Once, he barged into a party cell meeting, refused to leave, and insisted on participating in the party's organizational life. The political instructor talked to him, explaining the party's principles and basic knowledge, and educating him to correctly view the issue of joining the party. He said, "Political instructor, I don't understand or want to listen to these principles. Anyway, if I can't join the party, I won't be able to explain it to my parents." Then he bowed and kowtowed to the political instructor, saying, "Please show mercy and help me join the party. No matter what you want, my parents can buy it for you!" A soldier in a certain air force unit was always gloomy. He confided in the political instructor, saying, "It seems that my chance to join the party is 'over.' In half a year, I will be discharged, and I am worried that I won't be able to enter the house. Last winter, my father knew that I had not joined the party and wrote a letter scolding me as an 'unfilial son,' saying that if I can't join the party, I shouldn't come back to see him." Urban soldiers are even more so. A certain communication station this year received 528 urban soldiers, and 83% of the soldiers' parents gave their children the "definite join the party before coming back" task.

If the requirement for children to join the party is to urge them to dedicate themselves to communism and become a noble person, that is good; even if it is for the glory of the family, it is understandable. However, some people's purpose for wanting their children to join the party is astonishing. A mother said when sending her son to the army, "Once you join the party, you will benefit for life!" A soldier in a certain infantry company said, "I joined the army with only one task, to join the party. I have a 'gentleman's agreement' with my father and mother: as long as I join the party and bring glory to their faces, their more than ten million yuan of property will all be mine." Another urban soldier, who had not completed the "join the party" task given by his parents before his discharge, began to defy the company's cadres, eventually losing his reason, violating military discipline, and receiving a demerit upon returning home. The government of his hometown stipulates that those who receive demerits from the army will not be arranged for work. Thus, he quarreled with his parents, saying, "It was all your bad idea to force me to join the party, resulting in my losing everything!"

The psychological pressure on rural soldiers seems to be heavier and more widespread. "Child, in the army, even if it's climbing a knife mountain or entering a fire sea, you must fight hard..." What a beautiful encouragement! However, the conclusion is, "Only by working hard can you strive to be recruited to the city!" "Jumping out of the farming gate," this is the hope and requirement of some parents for their children. Otherwise, learn a skill, and you can hold an iron bowl. A new soldier bluntly said, "I joined the army for 'curved employment.' If I become a volunteer soldier or enter a military academy and be promoted, I will naturally be arranged for work after demobilization." Achieving merit and joining the party are also ways to arrange work; otherwise, learn a skill, and you can hold an iron bowl. A soldier who performed well after enlisting quickly became a squad leader. However, his mother wrote in a letter, "What's the use of being a squad leader? Quickly ask the leader to help you learn to drive a car, come back to run transportation, and make big money." In a certain new recruits' camp, 74% of the soldiers' parents specially went to the unit to give gifts, requesting that the unit's leaders allocate their children to learn to drive a car or cook, or at least learn radio repair.

In wartime, military families hoped for good news of their relatives' achievements from the front, which was an important part of the army's political work. Now, some military families' thoughts on hoping for good news of achievements are different from the past. Some local party committees and governments stipulate that the families of soldiers who achieve merit can receive preferential treatment, and the soldiers can be arranged for work after demobilization. This regulation has its positive significance. However, its negative significance is also significant. Even on the battlefield of blood and fire, achieving merit is not easy, let alone in peacetime! And not achieving merit does not mean not being a good soldier; the original intention of achieving merit should not be to "jump out of the farming gate." Therefore, a soldier wrote at the end of the year, "You asked me to achieve a great merit in the army and arrange work when I

### “入党立功”与“望子成龙”

　　“入党立功”与“望子成龙”
    本报记者  罗同松
    今年春天某部队有名战士退伍时，因为没有入党，怕回去无法向父母交待，携带手榴弹藏入山沟，准备自杀。幸好被人发现，避免了一场悲剧。这虽然是极个别的事例，但却反映了一个值得人们关注的问题。
    军属们希望子女在部队立功、入党、提干，本是美好的愿望。不论是战争时期还是和平年代，亲人的嘱托一直是战士进步、军队建设的有力支持。然而，现在，美好的愿望有时成了战士的苦衷，成了部队工作的一个难点。
    “一定要立个功回来！”“一定要入党回来！”“一定要提干回来！”收到这样的家信的战士相当多。有个军官说：“这种硬指标就像沉重的石头压在战士的心上，严重地影响了他们的健康成长。”
    父母“望子成龙”比较集中地反映在入党问题上，武警某部４个中队今年入伍的战士，有７５％的人写了入党申请书。据调查，这些写入党申请书的战士，有些人并不是自愿要求入党，而是出于家庭的高压。某炮兵部队有个战士入伍才半年，就写了６份入党申请书，而且经常央求党员们介绍他入党。有次排里党小组开会，他闯进门来，赖着不走，非要参加党组织生活不可。指导员找他谈心，给他讲党的宗旨和党的基本知识，教育他正确对待入党问题。他说：“指导员，你讲这些道理我听不懂，也不想听。反正我入不了党，没法向我父母交待。”接着他又向指导员打躬作揖，说：“你开恩吧，照顾我入党，不管要什么，我爸爸妈妈都可以给你买！”空军某部有名战士成天闷闷不乐，他向指导员交心说：“我入党的事看来是‘黄’了。还有半年我就要退伍了，我担心到时候进不了家门。去年冬天我父亲知道我还没有入党，写信骂我是‘不争气的儿子’，还说入不了党，就不要回去见他。”城市籍战士尤甚。某部通信站今年接收５２８名城市籍战士，８３％的战士父母给孩子下了“一定要入党回来”的死任务。
    如果要求孩子入党，是为了督促孩子为共产主义献身，做一个高尚的人，那当然好；就是为了光辉门第，也无可厚非。可是，有些人要孩子入党的目的，令人惊诧不已。有位母亲在送儿子入伍时说：“入了党，一辈子都有利！”某步兵连一名城市籍战士说：“我来参军，唯一的任务是入党。我和爸爸、妈妈有个‘君子协定’，只要我入了党，给他们脸上争了光，他们的１０多万元家产就全部归我。”还有名城市籍战士快到退伍时尚未完成父母交给的“入党任务”，便和连里干部“对着干”，进而发展到失去理智，违犯了军纪，背了个处分回家。而他原籍的政府规定，凡从部队受处分回来的，一律不给安排工作。于是他和父母翻了脸，说：“都是你们出的馊主意，非逼我入党不可，结果害得我鸡飞蛋打！”
    农村籍战士所受的思想压力似乎更重一些，范围更广一些。“孩子，到了部队，就是上刀山、下火海，也要拚命干……”多么美好的鼓励啊！然而结论是“只有好好干，才能争取招工进城呀！”“跳农门”，这便是有的家长对儿女的希望和要求。要不就学门技术，铁饭碗也可以端上。有名新战士直率地说：“我入伍就是‘曲线就业’，要是当了志愿兵，或者进了军校提了干，转业后自然可以安排工作。”立功、入党也是安排工作的“路子”；要不就学门技术，铁饭碗也可以端上。有名战士入伍后表现不错，很快当了班长。可是他母亲来信说：“当班长顶啥用？快向领导说说情，让你去学开汽车，回来可以跑运输，赚大钱。”某新兵营有７４％的战士家长专程到部队送礼，请求部队领导分配他们的子女去学开汽车或学烹饪，要不，学无线电修理也行。
    战争年代，军属们盼望前方的亲人寄立功喜报回家，是部队强有力的政治工作的一部分。如今，有的军属盼寄立功喜报的思想动机和过去也不同了。有的地方党委和政府规定，凡战士立功者，其家属可以受到优待，本人退伍后可以安排工作。这种规定有其积极意义。不过，它的消极意义也不小。即便是在血与火的战场上，立功也是很不容易的，何况平时呢！而没有立功不等于不是好战士，立功的初衷也决不能是为了“跳农门”。因此，有名战士年终在信中说：“你们要求我在部队立个大功，回去好安排工作。我是不孝之子，无法完成这个任务。因为我们连今年没有一个立功的。”
    部队干部热忱希望军属不断对子女进行鼓励，鼓励他们入党，鼓励他们立功，鼓励他们成才，鼓励他们荣升。他们希望多看到这样的来信。“我们家单是养殖一项，今年上半年可望比去年同期增收１．５万元。全家高兴之际，自然想到了国家。要是没有巩固的国防，何来我们的家富？因此，全家人希望你在部队尊重领导，团结他人，认真学习技术，掌握本领，守好国门。全家人也希望你争取入党，争取寄张立功喜报回来！”这封信刊在某防化连墙报上，连指导员说：“这封信比我讲一堂课还顶用！”
