Recently, new-style wuxia novels have gradually infiltrated from the streets into universities, government agencies, and research institutions. Many highly educated gentlemen initially looked down on them, but once they started reading, they became as addicted as if they had drunk from a spring of madness, unable to stop. When a few good friends gather, they often say, "If we don't talk about Jin Yong, Liang Yusheng, and Gu Long at the start, reading all the classics is in vain."

Generally speaking, they do not eagerly discuss the techniques and moves of martial arts, nor do they delve deeply into whether the plot is reasonable or not. So, what exactly attracts these intellectuals who were once or still consider themselves superior? Is it the hopeless love that "asks what love is in this world, making people willing to die for it"? Or is it the loneliness and arrogance of holding a sword and looking around at the vast emptiness? Or perhaps it is the righteous and heroic spirit of breaking out of books to stand up for the weak and the righteous? Can we say that certain characteristics of new-style wuxia novels perfectly match the mindset of some contemporary intellectuals, allowing them to roam in the bewildering and unrestrained world of wuxia through a unique aesthetic approach?

Some intellectuals complain, "Life is boring!" The pages of history, soaked with tears and blood and reflecting the glint of knives and swords for hundreds of years, have heavily turned over. Today, it seems that society should sing "peace and tranquility," but one always feels that there is a lack of a mechanism that allows everyone to fully display their talents. However, the traditional sense of mission and social responsibility of Chinese intellectuals still cling to and press you to do something significant in this life. It is just that long-term suppression has finally made most scholars mature to a state of "wanting to speak but holding back, saying instead that the autumn is cool." But they are still restless, thinking souls, and are often dissatisfied with a life lacking passion. It is almost by chance that they joyfully find a channel for venting their emotions in the loud singing and crying of wuxia novels. Like Yang Guo and Linghu Chong, who have been repeatedly insulted and slandered by the world but finally encounter a strange encounter, practice extraordinary martial arts to eliminate evil and promote good, they can vent their grievances and feel refreshed. These heroic figures despise the distinction between righteousness and evil, disregard social customs, love what they love, and have no regrets or complaints. Although they have gone through many tribulations, they ultimately achieve their goals. This clearly gives those intellectuals who are unable to break free from the middle way some spiritual comfort.

Indeed, reforms have provided some opportunities for people to showcase their talents, but rain will not fall universally, and opportunities are only given to those who have the courage and can dare to take risks. As for the vast majority of scholars, they dare to think but not to act, often hot-blooded when discussing changes, hoping to participate in the reform but not daring to get serious, and can only hide behind the daring and bold images of the heroes to comfort themselves and balance their restless hearts.

Some intellectuals, however, live too tiredly. Overloaded work, poor nutrition, endless household chores tightly bind them; they also strive to make themselves more rounded, numbing their smile muscles in front of others, but behind the scenes, they have a belly full of bitterness that they cannot pour out. But even if they are as smooth as possible, they may not be rewarded with great tasks from heaven, but rather alienate themselves. Thus, they feel humble and pitiful every day, but still do not dare to go against the tide, express their individuality, and live a life of thunder and lightning, truly having a sense of "I will laugh wildly and I will cry, crying happily and crying miserably," and this sadness can only be slightly dispelled when reading about heroes fighting for their dignity and dignity. Their singing, crying, and wild laughter finally find a place to vent.

Regarding withdrawal from the world and entering the world, Confucianism and Taoism have been arguing for two thousand years. Chinese intellectuals have always realized the importance of transcendence only when they are disappointed. Perhaps our nation has a genetic factor of advanced thinking, and the scholars of pre-industrialized society in China have the coldness and loneliness of modern people in a post-industrialized society, deeply experiencing the limitations and emptiness of life. The heroes and young heroes of new-style wuxia novels just happen to resonate with their life insights, walking alone with a sword in the vast wilderness, not asking where they come from, nor caring where they go, silently and proudly enduring endless loneliness and solitude. Ancient scholars who withdrew from the world were called "hidden in the wilderness," and those who entered the world were called "hidden in the court." Now, perhaps a considerable part of those who "live without energy" and "live too tiredly" are both involuntarily and inevitably "hidden" in books—"hidden" in profound treatises, "hidden" in beautiful words and phrases, and also "hidden" in wuxia novels to enjoy the thrill and greatness of life for a moment.

Nie Ganru, who was good at writing miscellaneous essays and suffered from many "movements," was crazy about wuxia and once gave a poem to Liang Yusheng: "Wine does not intoxicate people, how can people get drunk? Books truly make me foolish, and I am originally foolish," which reveals some bitterness within. Perhaps, when it is not about relying on extraordinary martial arts but about displaying one's own talents, standing tall and proud in the world, the state of loneliness when emotions run deep will not seem so attractive and hard to let go of...

### 书生之情寄于书——知识界武侠小说迷心态初探

　　书生之情寄于书
    ——知识界武侠小说迷心态初探
    本报记者  王政
    近年来，新派武侠小说渐由市井渗入高校、机关、科研单位。许多受过高等教育的翩翩君子起初对之不屑一顾，可一旦入眼，便如饮狂泉，欲罢不能。三五好友相聚，大有“开篇不谈金（庸）、梁（羽生）、古（龙），读尽诗书也枉然”之慨。
    一般说来，他们并不津津乐道于武功的路数招式，也不深究故事情节的合理与否。那么，究竟是什么吸引了这些曾经或依然自视甚高的知识分子呢？难道是那种“问世间情为何物，直教人生死相许”的无望情爱？或是那种一剑在手、四顾茫茫的孤傲与寂寞？抑或是破书而出的抑强扶弱、大义凛然的干云豪气？是不是可以说，新派武侠小说的某些特点正好契合了当代某些知识分子的心态，使他们得以用一种独特的审美方式遨游于迷离恣肆的武侠天地之中呢？
    有的知识分子抱怨“活得没劲儿”！几百年浸透眼泪鲜血、映照刀光剑影的历史之页已沉重地翻过去了，今天似乎应该高唱“平安无事”，总感到社会上缺乏一种让每个人都能自如地发挥才干的机制。然而中国知识分子传统的使命感和社会责任感却又生生地缠着你、逼着你这辈子非干出点什么事来不可。只是长期的压抑终于使大部分读书人成熟到了“欲说还休，却道天凉好个秋”的无奈与无为的境界。但他们毕竟是一些不安分的、思维着的灵魂，对于缺乏激情的生活偏偏会时常心有不甘。也算是误打误撞，他们惊喜地在武侠小说的大歌大哭中找到一条痛快淋漓的宣泄渠道。如屡蒙诟辱、满世皆谤，但终于欣逢奇遇，练就不世武功来除奸扬善的杨过与令狐冲，足以使他们一吐憋屈、神清气爽。这些侠义英雄鄙睨正邪之分，不顾世俗礼法，爱我所爱，不悔不怨，虽历尽劫难，但终成正果。这分明给予那些无力摆脱中庸之道的知识分子以某种精神安慰。
    的确，改革提供了某些让人一展雄才的机会，但毕竟不会甘霖普降，机遇只赐予那些有魄力、能豁得出去的弄潮儿。至于绝大多数读书人，则敢想而不敢干，坐而论道往往热血沸腾，希望参与变革却又不敢动真格的，只好躲在大侠们敢作敢为的形象背后安抚自己，平衡一下自己不平静的心灵。
    有的知识分子则活得太累。超负荷的工作，匮乏的营养，没完没了的家务死死地缠住他们；还要努力把人做圆乎一些，在人前麻木了笑神经，背着人则有一肚子倒不出的苦水。但就算圆滑到顶，也未必换来天降大任于斯人，反而异化了自我。于是，日觉卑微可怜、却仍不敢反其道而行之，张扬个性，活出一个轰轰烈烈来，真有股子“我将狂笑我将哭，哭始欣然笑惨然”的悲凉，而这悲凉只有在读到侠义英雄为人格与尊严不惜生死相搏之时方能稍稍散去。他们的歌哭狂笑终于找到了寄托之所。
    关于出世入世，儒道两家颠来倒去折腾了两千年之久。中国的知识分子历来是在失意时才憬悟唯有超脱是为良方。或许本民族有超前思维的遗传因子，处在前工业化社会的华夏士子们却有了后工业化社会那种现代人的冷漠感与孤独感，深味到生命的有限与虚无。而新派武侠小说的大侠、少侠们恰恰与他们的生命感悟一拍即合，一剑茫茫走大荒，不要问我从哪里来，也别管我到哪里去，默默地、傲然地忍受着无限的寂寞和孤独。古代知识分子逸世者谓隐于野，入世者则美其名曰隐于朝。现如今大约相当一部分“活得没劲儿”和“活得太累”的人是既情不自禁又迫不得已地“隐”于书了——“隐”于高头讲章者有之，“隐”于美文丽辞者有之，也包括“隐”于武侠小说在片刻之中享受人生的惊心动魄和伟丈夫气概。
    善写杂文、又迭受“运动”之苦的聂绀弩狂迷武侠，曾有诗赠梁羽生曰：“酒不醉人人怎醉，书诚愚我我原愚”，颇道出一些个中辛酸。或许，等到了不是凭绝顶武功，而是靠施展自己才华，昂首挺胸地活在世上的时候，“武侠”那种情到深处人孤独的境界才不会显得那样迷人，那样令人难以割舍……
