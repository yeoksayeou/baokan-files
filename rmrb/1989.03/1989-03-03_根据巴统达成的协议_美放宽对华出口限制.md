The U.S. Department of Commerce announced today that the United States, in accordance with an agreement reached by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), has made significant revisions to its export restrictions on China.

It is reported that the COCOM agreement has made major revisions to export restrictions in 13 product categories. The most significant changes involve raising the technological level of export items to the People's Republic of China, including telecommunications equipment, metalworking machinery, chemical and petroleum equipment, electrical power equipment, general industrial equipment, transportation equipment, electronics and precision instruments, chemical products, non-metallic products, petroleum products, and other related raw materials.

Paul Friedman, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce in charge of exports, said these revisions indicate that the United States and its COCOM allies are determined to continue improving relations with the People's Republic of China and are willing to support China's promotion of civilian industries. Statistics show that the bilateral trade volume between the United States and China in 1988 was approximately $14 billion.
