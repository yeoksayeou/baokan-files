Today, seedless grapes, plums, peaches, and raspberries imported from Chile suddenly disappeared from the shelves of tens of thousands of supermarkets across the United States. The U.S. authorities issued a nationwide warning to residents: due to the discovery of two grapes containing highly toxic cyanide from Chile, all Chilean fruits should be immediately stopped from being consumed.

The United States has completely banned the import of fruits from Chile. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today ordered relevant ports to seal all Chilean fruits.

On March 2, the U.S. Embassy in Chile received an anonymous call from a Spanish-speaking man saying that Chilean export fruits would be contaminated with poison. A few days later, the embassy received a second call stating that their threat was not a hoax. Subsequently, the U.S. conducted an investigation and finally discovered that two grapes had been injected with cyanide.

Last winter, the United States imported approximately $300 million worth of Chilean fruits, accounting for one-third of the annual fruit import volume. Last year, 80% of the grapes imported by the United States came from Chile. Currently, the U.S. fruit market is in a season of scarcity. Relevant officials said that this incident is a disaster for the $750 million fruit import industry in the United States and Canada, and it is also a devastating blow to Chile's $600 million fruit export industry, as fruits are Chile's second-largest export product after copper. Statistics show that it will take the United States a year to resume normal fruit imports from Chile.

Chile's Minister of the Interior condemned international terrorism for sabotaging the country's economic interests. The Chilean government accused the United States' ban on imports as a "dirty trick" played on Chile.

　　两颗毒葡萄　一片警告声
    美国禁止进口智利水果
    本报华盛顿３月１４日电  记者仓立德报道：今天，美国从智利进口的无籽葡萄、李子、油桃、木莓等新鲜水果，突然从成千上万家超级市场的货架上消失了。美国当局向全国居民发出警告：因从智利进口的葡萄中发现两颗含有剧毒的氰化物，立即停止食用一切智利水果。
    美国已全面禁止从智利进口水果。美国食品药物管理局今天命令有关口岸封存全部智利水果。
    本月２日，美国驻智利使馆接到一名操西班牙语的男子打来的匿名电话，说智利的出口水果将被撒上毒物。几天后，美国使馆接到的第２个电话称他们的威胁不是欺骗。随后美国展开检查，终于发现有两颗葡萄被注射了氰化物。
    美国去冬进口了价值约３亿美元的智利水果，占全年进口水果量的１／３。美国去年进口的葡萄，有８０％来自智利。目前美国水果市场正是青黄不接的季节。有关人士说，这个事件对美国及加拿大７．５亿美元的水果进口业是一场灾难，对智利６亿美元的水果出口业也是一场毁灭性打击，因为水果是智利仅次于铜的第二大出口产品。据统计，美国恢复从智利的正常水果进口需要一年时间。
    智利内政部长谴责国际恐怖主义破坏该国经济利益的活动。智利政府指责美国的抵制进口行动是对智利耍弄的“肮脏伎俩”。
