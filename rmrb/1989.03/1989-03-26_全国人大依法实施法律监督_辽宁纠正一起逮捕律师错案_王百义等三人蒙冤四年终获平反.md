The National People's Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee have effectively supervised the law enforcement agencies, leading to the correction of a wrongful arrest case involving three lawyers in Liaoning Province. After four years of wrongful imprisonment, Wang Baiyi, Wang Licheng, and Wang Zhishuang have finally been exonerated.

The three lawyers from the Tai'an County Legal Consultation Office—Wang Baiyi, Wang Licheng, and Wang Zhishuang—were wrongfully accused of "concealment" for performing their legal duties of defense. They were arrested twice and wrongfully imprisoned for four years. Under the supervision of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, this miscarriage of justice has been rectified.

On May 21, 1984, the Intermediate People's Court of Anshan City held a trial for a "rape resulting in death" case. The Tai'an County Legal Consultation Office assigned lawyers Wang Zhishuang and Wang Licheng to defend the accused. Based on the case materials, the lawyers believed that the evidence against the accused was insufficient and that there were doubts. With the approval of the Legal Consultation Office, they argued for the accused's innocence. After the first trial, the accused appealed, and Wang Zhishuang and Wang Licheng wrote an appeal on behalf of the accused, maintaining that the charges could not be established. The second trial rejected the appeal and upheld the original verdict.

In mid-August of the same year, Wang Changjiu, who had been detained for another case, revealed after his release that lawyer Wang Licheng had leaked case information to the accused during a visit and promised to defend the accused's innocence. Subsequently, Wang Changjiu repeatedly wrote to the procuratorial authorities. The Anshan City People's Procuratorate arrested Wang Licheng and Wang Zhishuang on charges of "concealment." Two months later, they also arrested Wang Baiyi, the director of the Tai'an County Legal Consultation Office, on the grounds that he had directed Wang Licheng and Wang Zhishuang to argue for the accused's innocence. On April 26, 1985, the Anshan City People's Procuratorate filed a lawsuit with the Intermediate People's Court, seeking criminal charges against Wang Baiyi and Wang Licheng. Wang Zhishuang was "exempted from prosecution" due to "minor circumstances." Later, under the supervision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, after a review by the Standing Committee of the Liaoning Provincial People's Congress and other leading agencies, it was concluded that the arrest of the three lawyers from Tai'an was a wrongful case and should be rectified.

In May 1987, two years later, the Anshan City People's Procuratorate arrested Wang Licheng again without discovering new evidence. Later, they declared "exemption from prosecution." Wang Licheng and others, with the support of the All-China Lawyers Association, filed an appeal, which was rejected by the Anshan City People's Procuratorate. The Anshan City Procuratorial authorities still insisted that the lawyers had committed the crime of "concealment."

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress paid close attention to this illegal incident, organized an investigation, and transferred the relevant proposals from the NPC deputies to the Supreme People's Procuratorate for handling. The Supreme People's Procuratorate immediately instructed the Liaoning Provincial People's Procuratorate to order the Anshan City People's Procuratorate to enforce the law strictly and handle the case properly. The Standing Committee of the Liaoning Provincial People's Congress actively supervised the procuratorial authorities to rectify the case. It is reported that the Supreme People's Procuratorate recently reported to the Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress that the case of wrongful accusation against Wang Licheng and the other three lawyers has been rectified. The spiritual and economic losses suffered by Wang Licheng and others due to this wrongful case have been compensated.

　　全国人大依法实施法律监督        
    辽宁纠正一起逮捕律师错案 
    王百义等三人蒙冤四年终获平反
    本报讯  新华社通讯员郭阳、记者周长新、本报记者吴恒权报道：辽宁省台安县法律顾问处王百义、王力成、王志双三律师，依法履行辩护职责反被指控犯有“包庇罪”，两次遭逮捕、蒙冤达４载。在全国人民代表大会及其常务委员会对执法机关实施有效监督下，这一错案近日被纠正。
    １９８４年５月２１日，鞍山市中级法院开庭审理一起“强奸致死人命”案，台安县法律顾问处接受委托指派律师王志双、王力成为被告人辩护。律师根据案卷材料，认为指控被告犯罪的证据不足，存在疑点，经法律顾问处集体同意，为被告作了无罪辩护。一审判决后，被告不服，王志双、王力成依法为被告代写上诉状，坚持认为指控不能成立。二审驳回了上诉，维持原判。
    同年８月中旬，曾因另案被押的王长久出狱后揭发律师王力成借会见被告人之机，向被告人泄露案情，并应许给其作无罪辩护。此后又连续上书检察机关。鞍山市人民检察院据此以“包庇罪”将王力成、王志双二人逮捕；两个月后，又以台安县法律顾问处主任王百义曾主持讨论该案，授意王力成、王志双作无罪辩护为由，指控他犯有“包庇罪”，予以逮捕。１９８５年４月２６日，鞍山市人民检察院向市中级法院提起公诉，要求追究王百义、王力成的刑事责任。王志双因“情节轻微”被“免予起诉”。后在全国人大常委会的监督下，经辽宁省人大常委会等领导机关复查，认为逮捕台安三律师是一起错案，应予纠正。
    １９８７年５月，事隔两年，鞍山市人民检察院在没有发现新证据的情况下，再次将王力成逮捕，其后又宣告“免予起诉”。王力成等人在中华全国律师协会的支持下，提出申诉，被鞍山市人民检察院驳回。鞍山市检察机关仍然坚持认为律师犯有“包庇罪”。
    全国人大常委会对这一违法事件极为关注，组织力量进行了调查，并将人大代表的相应提案转交最高人民检察院处理。该院随即指示辽宁省人民检察院责成鞍山市人民检察院严肃执法，对此案妥善处理。辽宁省人大常委会依法积极督促检察机关纠正此案。据悉，最高人民检察院最近向全国人大内务司法委员会报告王力成等三律师被错误指控一案已经纠正。王力成等人因这一错案而受到的精神上和经济上的损失，已经得到了补偿。
