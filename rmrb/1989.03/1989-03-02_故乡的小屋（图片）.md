The Cottage in My Hometown
Huáng Chéngjiāng  Painting
Yáng Xiǎomín  Poetry

In the bewildering knocks on the door across the river, I went to that distant place.
That night, a lamp lit up twice.
When I could no longer walk, I gazed at the old family outhouse, but I couldn't see Mama.
Standing alone in the snowy wilderness of the night, she prayed for her son's happiness.
And I, with my solitary claps, seemed like an old person's tear—
Half for loving someone, half for hating someone.
In the seemingly dreamless midnight, at the moment of turning back,
Oh, everything is covered in snow. Two yellowed, oil-painted windows, neither closed nor open.
