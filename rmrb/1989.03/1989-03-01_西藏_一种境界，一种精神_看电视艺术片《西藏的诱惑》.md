Tibet is a beautiful and mystical land, a place that artists from China and abroad yearn for and pursue. Recently, the Central Television Station broadcasted Liu Lang's TV art film "The Allure of Tibet." It does not confine itself to the objective recording and representation of physical entities but focuses on the expression of images and the emotional outpouring of subjective feelings, imbuing material objects with a thick layer of emotional color.

The lens of the television camera becomes the eyes of the artist, revealing the artist's soul. Everything it captures, all objective things, strive to express the beauty of Tibet, creating a unique realm of beauty: the cultural relics that have endured the vicissitudes of time, the lush and vast grasslands, the undulating and endless mountains and rivers; even a patch of blue sky, a white cloud, a solitary tree, a stubborn rock, a clump of green grass, a mural, all seem so mystical, permeated with an eternal charm. This artistic truth, elevated by the artist's subjective consciousness, truly grasps and reflects the essence and truth of this mysterious plateau of Tibet.

"The Allure of Tibet" not only showcases the picturesque natural beauty of Tibet but, more importantly, it reveals through beautiful images the spirit of a nation: unyielding faith, persistent pursuit, and the grandeur of selfless dedication. As the artist writes in the "Creator's Preface": "The allure of Tibet is not just because of its history and geography, but because: Tibet is a realm."—The creator's subjectivity becomes the soul of the TV art film.

"The Allure of Tibet" is meticulously woven with the pilgrimage of three generations of religious monks as the warp and the devout artistic pursuits of four famous artists as the weft. It praises and extols that "pilgrimage spirit": "Everyone has a true god in their heart, the true god does not manifest unless the heart is sincere, only those half-hearted people fail to see it"; that persistent pursuit: "I am a lamp, seeking light, seeking fire; I am a drop of water, seeking rivers, seeking seas"; that strict self-reflection: "Everyone in the world bathes, not necessarily in water; repentance is the bathing of the soul, enlightenment is the rebirth of the flesh"; that unyielding pursuit and struggle: "If you do not reach the summit of the mountain, life is a regret; if you do not trace the river to its source, you will end in regret."

Is this only the spiritual realm of religious believers? I think this spiritual realm has a certain universal significance in life. Even ordinary people, who does not have a "true god" in their hearts? This is the ideal and belief, and for this, one pursues and struggles. As the creator says in the "Director's Statement": "Do not underestimate the act of pilgrimage, step by step, kowtowing for thousands of miles, ordinary people cannot do it, here lies the spirit of humanity. Standing here, looking at it, Tibet is a realm."

Because "The Allure of Tibet" delves deeply into this "Tibetan spirit," "Tibetan realm," it possesses a rich cultural consciousness and aesthetic consciousness. "The Allure of Tibet" is an allure of temperament and spirit.

The TV art film is a new artistic form on the screen. Its appearance fully demonstrates that television can not only produce popular "star culture" but also produce refined "philosophical culture," or a combination of both high and low culture.

　　西藏——一种境界，一种精神
    ——看电视艺术片《西藏的诱惑》
    高鑫
    西藏，是一片美丽而神奇的土地，是中外艺术家向往和追寻的地方。最近中央电视台播出的刘郎编导的电视艺术片《西藏的诱惑》，不局限于客观实体的纪录与再现，着力于意象的表现和主观情感的抒发，给物质的客体蒙上了浓重的感情色彩。
    电视摄像机的镜头，化作了艺术家的眼睛，透视出艺术家的心灵。它所捕捉的一切客观事物，都着力表现了西藏的美，创造了独特的美的境界：那历尽沧桑的文化遗址，那葱绿浩茫的草甸，那起伏绵延的山川；甚或是一片蓝天、一朵白云、一棵孤树、一块顽石、一丛绿草、一面壁画，都显得那么神奇，渗透着悠悠神韵。这种被艺术家主观意识升华了的艺术真实，才真正把握和反映了西藏这块神秘高原的精髓和真谛。
    《西藏的诱惑》不仅展示了西藏如图似画的自然风貌之美，更可贵的是：它透过优美的画面揭示了一个民族的精神：坚韧不拔的信念，执著追求的意志，无私奉献的气魄。恰如艺术家在片头的“创作者题记”中所说：“西藏的诱惑，不仅因为它的历史，它的地理，更因为：西藏，是一种境界。”——创作者的这种主体意识，成为电视艺术片的灵魂。
    《西藏的诱惑》以三代宗教僧侣虔诚地跋涉在朝圣之途为经线，以四位著名艺术家虔诚的艺术追求为纬线，精心编织而成。它歌颂和赞美了那种“朝圣精神”：“人人心中有真神，不是真神不显圣，只怕是半心半意的人”；那种执著的追求：“我是一盏灯，祈求光，祈求火；我是一滴水，祈求江，祈求河”；那种严格的自省：“世上人人都洗浴，未必都在水之中；忏悔是心灵的洗浴，省悟是血肉的再生”；那种坚韧不拔的追求和奋斗：“登山不到极顶，人生遗憾；溯流不到源头，抱恨终身”。
    难道，这仅仅是宗教信徒的精神境界么？我以为这种精神境界带有人生的某种普遍意义。即便是普通的人，心中谁没有一个“真神”？这就是理想和信念，并为此去追求、奋斗。恰如创作者在“编导阐述”中所说：“别小看朝圣这件事，一步一步长头，磕上千里之遥，一般人做不到，这里面有人类精神。站在这里看，西藏是一种境界。”
    由于《西藏的诱惑》对这种“西藏精神”、“西藏境界”的深入开掘，使得它具有了浓厚的文化意识和审美意识。《西藏的诱惑》是一种气质和精神的诱惑。
    电视艺术片是荧屏上一种崭新的艺术样式。它的出现，充分说明了电视不仅可以制作通俗的“歌星文化”，而且可以制作高雅的“思辩文化”，或者雅俗共赏的两相结合。
