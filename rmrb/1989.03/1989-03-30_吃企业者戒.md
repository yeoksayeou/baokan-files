Title: A Warning to Those Who Exploit Enterprises

Currently, there are many who exploit enterprises, and they do so in quite ingenious ways. Even in activities like selecting the "Top Ten," there are those who engage in such behavior.

Selecting the "Top Ten" is not entirely a bad thing. If done well, it can promote excellence and limit inferiority, encouraging the production of high-quality goods. The problem is that Chinese people tend to follow trends, and once a trend starts, good things can get distorted. This "Top Ten" and that "Top Ten," today's selection and tomorrow's evaluation, even units and individuals unrelated to product quality inspection join in the fun. Doing things this way, it's no wonder that the "Top Ten" selections become diluted and lose their appeal.

Even worse, in some "Top Ten" evaluations, the awards are treated as commodities. They claim to be selecting, but in reality, they are seeking profit. Whether or not a company makes the list depends entirely on how much money the enterprise contributes. If we say that such evaluations are akin to robbery, it would not be an exaggeration.

The Qingdao Beer Factory and 12 other beer factories are all advanced enterprises. They neither seek empty fame nor yield to bad trends. They jointly refused to participate in the "National Top Ten Beers" selection activity, standing firm and justified. Bad trends actually fear resistance. If a society can treat bad trends like "rats crossing the street," with everyone shouting to drive them away, how can bad trends continue to spread?

　　吃企业者戒
    时下，吃企业者甚多，吃起来很有些花头，评“十佳”之类活动中，也不乏其人其事。
    评“十佳”并不都是坏事，办好了，可以扶优限劣，促进优质生产。问题是，中国人好刮风，而一刮风，好事就给刮变形了。这“十佳”，那“十佳”，今天评，明日选，一些与鉴定产品质量不相干的单位和人也来凑热闹，这么干，不把“十佳”评滥了、评倒了胃口才是怪事。
    更有甚者，“十佳”评选中，有的把奖杯当商品，说是评选，实为图利，能否上榜，全看企业出资多少。如果说这类评选无异于巧取豪夺，恐怕不冤枉。
    青岛啤酒厂等１３家啤酒厂都是先进企业，他们一不图虚名，二不向歪风低头，联合拒绝参加“全国十佳啤酒”评选活动，理直而气壮，做得对。歪风其实怕顶。一个社会对歪风如能像对待“过街老鼠”一样，“人人喊打”，歪风还能刮得起来吗？
