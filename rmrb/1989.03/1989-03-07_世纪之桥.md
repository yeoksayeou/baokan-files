In October 1988, the first academic journal co-founded by architects from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, titled *Architecture and City*, was born.

Last March, the Hong Kong Tourism International Publishing House began to plan the publication of *Architecture and City*. This immediately caught the attention of some architects from both sides of the Taiwan Strait. It seemed that everyone shared a common wish: could this journal become a link between architects from both sides of the Taiwan Strait? If this journal could serve as a "bridge" for Chinese architecture to reach the world, this would indeed be a historic event.

Now, after 39 years of separation, architects from both sides of the Taiwan Strait have finally begun to engage in dialogue in this magazine. See the congratulatory message sent by Huang Changmei, the editor-in-chief of the *Architect* magazine in Taiwan, for *Architecture and City*: "The experiences of the past in the Taiwan Strait, Hong Kong, and Macau regions have been quite different, and the paths they will take in the future are not entirely the same. However, based on the same bloodline, there are many similarities, and there is great concern for each other's future. In the field of architectural profession, each side also has its strengths and weaknesses, which can be learned from or referenced by the other."

Recently, we learned that architects in Taiwan are very interested in the Nationalities Cultural Palace, the Great Hall of the People, and the newly built National Library in Beijing, and have published a series of photo essays in related magazines. At the same time, mainland architects are particularly attentive to the progress of architectural development in Taiwan. Indeed, based on the same bloodline, architects from both sides of the Taiwan Strait are very concerned about the future of Chinese architecture. During the planning period, architects from both sides of the Taiwan Strait almost unanimously proposed the mission and goals of this magazine: to build a "bridge" for promoting exchanges and cooperation between the architectural communities of the mainland, Taiwan, and Hong Kong and Macau, and a "bridge" for connecting Chinese architects with the international architectural community. To embody this common wish, the cover of the inaugural issue of this magazine features a section of the famous painting *Along the River During the Qingming Festival* by the Northern Song Dynasty painter Zhang Zeduan, highlighting a late Northern Song Dynasty urban scene centered around a bridge on the Bian River.

Today, Chinese architectural and urban thoughts have permeated the global architectural philosophical currents. Chinese architecture and cities—the projection of Chinese space—have long transcended national borders and entered the global region. Outside of China, wherever there are Chinese people, there are Chinese architects, and there are buildings that reflect a certain relationship between Chinese space and spirit, such as "Chinatowns" and "Chinese cities." At the "Fourth Annual Meeting of the Modern Chinese Architecture Creation Research Group" held in Hangzhou last October, architects from the mainland and Hong Kong proposed the idea of establishing a "World Federation of Chinese Architects" and hoped that the *Architecture and City* magazine would also serve as a "bridge" connecting Chinese architects around the world.

When we stand on the horizon of history and look around the world, the achievements of Chinese architects from both sides of the Taiwan Strait and Chinese architects worldwide are creating a great revival of Chinese and world architectural culture. I.M. Pei, a Chinese-American architect, has become a source of pride for Chinese architects around the world. It is he who, with his extraordinary struggle and achievements, laid the foundation for the "bridge" for Chinese architects to reach the world. I.M. Pei's success shows that Chinese architects, based on the same bloodline, can excel in the world and make their works stand out in today's world of architecture and cities. Because modern architectural thought has transcended national borders, our time-space reference system coordinates encompass the entire world. Chinese architects are walking towards the world through the "bridge" of openness, stepping onto the international architectural stage to compete with the best. In recent years, a group of young and middle-aged Chinese architects have won multiple international architectural design competitions, showing their prowess and beginning to attract the attention and recognition of the international architectural community.

During my travels abroad, I often encounter foreign architect colleagues who ask me about the situation of Chinese architects. Indeed, Chinese architects have long been unknown to the world, and there have been no world-renowned architectural masters. In addition to the environment, conditions, and level of creation for Chinese architects, the previous isolation was an important reason. Will Chinese architects continue to be unknown in the world? The answer is no. Today, the "bridge" to the world has been built, architects from various countries are engaging in dialogue, exchange, and cooperation with Chinese architects, and the works of Chinese architects are walking towards the outside world through the "bridge." On the horizon of world architecture, the footsteps of future Chinese architectural masters have already begun to resonate.

　　世纪之桥

    １９８８年１０月，第一本由海峡两岸的中国建筑师携手创办的学术刊物——《建筑与城市》诞生了。
    去年３月，香港旅游国际出版机构开始酝酿《建筑与城市》出版事宜，此事立即引起了海峡两岸部分建筑师的关注，似乎大家都有着一个共同的心愿——此刊是否可以成为联系海峡两岸建筑师的纽带？如以此刊架起一座中国建筑通向世界之“桥”，这真是一件具有历史意义的大事。
    现在，隔断了３９年的海峡两岸的中国建筑师终于开始在这份杂志上对话，请看台湾《建筑师》杂志社主编黄长美建筑师为《建筑与城市》杂志所发来的贺词：“海峡两岸与港澳地区过去的经验迥异，未来将走的路子也不尽相同，但在同一血缘的基础上，有许多类似的地方，也对彼此的前途十分关心；在建筑专业的领域中，各自亦均有其长处与缺点，可供对方学习或借鉴。”
    近来，我们获悉台湾建筑师对北京民族文化宫、人民大会堂以及新建的国家图书馆很感兴趣，在有关杂志上发表了一系列图片专题评述；同时，大陆建筑师也特别关注台湾建筑进展的动向。确实，在同一血缘的基础上，海峡两岸的中国建筑师对中国建筑的前途都十分关心。在筹划期间，海峡两岸的建筑师几乎不约而同地提出了这份杂志的宗旨和目标：建立一座促进大陆与台湾、港澳地区建筑界之间开展交流与合作之“桥”，一座中国建筑师与国际建筑界联系之“桥”。为了体现这一共同的心愿，这份杂志创刊号封面选用了北宋画家张择端的传世作品《清明上河图》卷局部，突出了其中以汴河上一座桥为主体的北宋晚期都市画面。
    今天，中国的建筑与城市思想，已经渗入世界建筑哲学思潮。中国的建筑与城市——中国空间的投影，早已越过国界，进入世界区域。在中国以外的任何地方，只要有华人，就有华人建筑师，就有体现中国空间与精神之间某种关系的建筑与“唐人街”、“华城”。去年１０月在杭州举行的“现代中国建筑创作研究小组第四届年会”上，大陆与香港建筑师提出了建立“世界华人建筑师协会”的构想，并希望《建筑与城市》杂志同时成为联系世界各地华人建筑师之“桥”。
    当我们站在历史的地平线上，环顾世界，海峡两岸的中国建筑师、全世界的华人建筑师的成就，正在开创伟大的中国与世界建筑文化复兴。华裔美籍建筑师贝聿铭，已成为全世界华人建筑师的骄傲，正是他以自己非凡的奋斗及成就，奠定了华人建筑师走向世界之“桥”的基石。贝聿铭的成功，说明了在同一血缘基础上的华人建筑师能够称雄于世界，能够使自己的作品立于当今世界建筑与城市之林。由于现代建筑思想已经超越国界，我们的时空参照系的坐标囊括整个世界，中国建筑师正通过“开放”之桥走向世界，到国际建筑舞台上去与强手较量。近年来我国一批中青年建筑师在多项国际建筑设计竞赛中获奖，初试锋芒，已经开始引起国际建筑界的关注与承认。
    我在海外旅行时，经常遇到国外建筑师同行向我了解中国建筑师的状况。确实，中国建筑师多年来不为人知，更没有举世闻名的建筑大师。除了中国建筑师创作的环境、条件及水平之外，以前的封闭是重要原因。难道中国建筑师继续在世界上成为默默无闻之辈吗？结论是否定的。今天，通向世界之“桥”已经架设，各国建筑师已经与中国建筑师进行对话、交流与合作，中国建筑师的作品正通过“桥”走向外部世界，在世界建筑的地平线上，已经开始响起未来中国建筑大师的脚步声。
