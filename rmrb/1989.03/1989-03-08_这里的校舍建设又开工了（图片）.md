Construction of school buildings has resumed here.

On December 9 last year, our newspaper reported on the third page that the construction of eight primary schools in Xuanwu District, Beijing, had halted due to a shortage of building materials.

The municipal and district governments have paid close attention to this matter. After more than two months of work, the two levels of government have invested over 11 million yuan. The district construction commission has unified the supply of steel bars, cement, timber, and other building materials, and solved technical difficulties in construction.

This support has boosted the enthusiasm of the construction units. They have assured the district government that they will complete the construction of 20,000 square meters of school buildings by August 15 this year. By then, more than 11,000 school-age children will be able to start school on time, ensuring that the district will have no two-shift system in primary schools for three consecutive years.

    这里的校舍建设又开工了
    本报去年12月9日在三版用照片报道了北京市宣武区改建和扩建的8所小学校舍，因建筑材料短缺而停工的新闻。
    市区两级政府对此事十分关注。经过两个多月的工作，两级政府投资1100多万元，由区建委统一帮助供给钢筋、水泥、木材等建筑材料，解决施工技术难题。
    这一支持激发了施工单位的积极性，他们向区政府保证：在今年8月15日前完成施工的总建筑面积为2万平方米的校舍。届时，11000多名适龄儿童将按期上学，确保全区连续3年不出现小学二部制。
