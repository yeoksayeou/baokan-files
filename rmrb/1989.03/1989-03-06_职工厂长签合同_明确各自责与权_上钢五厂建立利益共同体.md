Workers and Factory Director Sign Contracts to Clarify Responsibilities and Rights
Shanggang Steel Plant Establishes a Community of Shared Interests

Shanghai, March 5th - Reporter Zhang Shihong reports: Recently, all workers at Shanggang Steel Plant signed a collective contract with the factory director, agreeing to fulfill their respective duties to achieve the maximum economic benefits. This marks a significant step in establishing a community of shared interests within the enterprise.

As early as last year, the plant's union proposed to "uphold the factory director's management authority and protect the workers' legal rights," and to "share responsibilities and risks with the factory director." Based on this proposal, the entire plant established systems for team upgrades, worker representative inspections, and democratic dialogues between workers and the factory director, effectively solving many internal problems. Recently, the plant's union, representing the workers, signed a collective contract with the factory director, focusing on the key issues in enterprise production and management, as well as the hot topics that workers care about, clearly defining the responsibilities and rights of the factory leadership and the workers.

According to the contract, a shared interest consultation meeting will be held every quarter, attended by the factory's party and government leaders, the union, and worker representatives, to conduct inspections. Every half-year, a report will be submitted to the worker representative assembly for review and questioning.

Factory Director Hou Shuting said, "The enterprise needs a self-motivating mechanism. Establishing a community of shared interests aims to foster the workers' sense of ownership, sharing risks and benefits. As the factory director, I will proactively accept supervision from all workers."

　　职工厂长签合同
    明确各自责与权
    上钢五厂建立利益共同体
    本报上海３月５日电  记者章世鸿报道：上钢五厂全体职工最近和厂长签订集体合同，保证履行各自的职责，以取得最大的经济效益，在建立企业利益共同体道路上走出了一大步。
    早在去年初，五厂工会就提出要“维护厂长的管理权威，维护职工的合法权益”，“与厂长共同承担责任，共同承担风险”。根据这个要求，全厂建立了班组升级、职工代表巡视检查、职工与厂长民主对话等制度，有效地解决了厂内许多困难。最近，由厂工会代表职工，与厂长进一步签订了集体合同，主要围绕企业生产经营管理中的难点和职工关心的生活等方面的热点，明确规定厂领导和职工各自的责任和权利。
    根据这个合同，每季度将召开一次厂党政领导、工会、职工代表参加的共同利益协商会议，加以检查；每半年向职代会报告一次，接受职工代表的审议质询。
    侯树庭厂长说：“企业需要有一个自我激励的机制，建立利益共同体，目的是发扬职工的主人翁精神，风险共担，利益共享。我作为厂长，将主动接受全体职工的监督。”
