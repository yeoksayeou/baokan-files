	U.S. and Soviet Foreign Ministers Hold Talks in Vienna
	Both Sides Deem Talks a Good Start
	Bush Welcomes Soviet New Proposal

	BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze held their first talks since the Bush administration took office in Vienna today. The two sides agreed to hold formal comprehensive talks in Moscow in the first half of May, and to discuss the date for a U.S.-Soviet summit during that time. The two foreign ministers also agreed to add a new agenda item to future U.S.-Soviet talks, focusing on international issues such as terrorism, drugs, and environmental protection.

	The talks were held at the residence of the U.S. Ambassador to Austria and lasted over two hours. After the talks, both foreign ministers deemed the meeting a "good start" and laid the foundation for continued cooperation between the two countries. President Bush gave a positive evaluation of the talks between Baker and Shevardnadze at a press conference in Washington today, describing it as a productive meeting.

	According to reports, the U.S. and Soviet foreign ministers discussed a wide range of issues during their talks on March 7. Regarding arms control, Baker told the Soviet foreign minister that the new U.S. administration's review of strategic weapons policy is expected to be completed by the end of April, at which time they will consider resuming strategic arms talks in Geneva. Baker also gave a cautious but positive assessment of the Soviet stance on European arms reduction, stating that the Soviet Union "seems to be moving in the right direction." Regarding Soviet reforms, Baker said that the U.S. believes Gorbachev's reform policies are "beneficial" to both the Soviet Union and the outside world, and hopes that the Soviet Union will successfully implement the reforms. However, the two foreign ministers also had differing views on issues such as the Middle East and Central America, presenting their respective views and engaging in "frank and constructive discussions" on other contentious issues.

	WASHINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bush today said that the Soviet Union's new proposal on reducing conventional forces in Europe is "encouraging."

	President Bush said at today's press conference that, in his view, this new plan indicates that the Soviet Union is moving closer to NATO's position on conventional arms reduction.

　　美苏外长在维也纳会谈
    双方认为会谈是个良好开端     
    布什欢迎苏联新建议
    本报华盛顿３月７日电  记者张启昕报道：美国国务卿贝克和苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽今天在维也纳举行了布什政府执政后的第一次会谈。双方商定，５月上半月，美苏两国外长在莫斯科举行正式的全面会谈，并同意届时就美苏首脑会晤的日期进行讨论。两国外长还同意，在今后美苏会谈的议程中，除了双边关系、裁军、中东及中美洲局势和人权问题外，新增加一项议程。即就恐怖主义、毒品和环保等国际性问题进行讨论。
    会谈是在美国驻奥地利大使的官邸举行的，历时两个多小时。会谈后，两国外长认为，这次会谈是个“良好的开端”，为美苏两国的继续合作打下了基础。布什总统今天在华盛顿举行的记者招待会上对贝克同谢瓦尔德纳泽的会谈作出积极评价，认为这是一次富有成效的会谈。
    据此间消息，美苏外长在７日的会谈中，讨论了范围广泛的问题。关于军备控制问题，贝克向苏联外长表示，美国新政府对战略武器政策的回顾可望在４月底完成，届时将考虑恢复美苏在日内瓦举行的战略武器谈判。贝克还对苏联在欧洲裁军问题的立场作了既有保留、但又积极的评价，认为苏联“看来是朝着正确的方向前进”。对于苏联的改革，贝克表示，美国相信戈尔巴乔夫的改革政策对苏联和外部世界是“有益的”，并希望苏联成功地推行改革。但两国外长也在中东、中美洲等问题上意见不一，阐述了各自的看法，并就其他有争议的问题“进行了坦率的、建设性的讨论”。
    新华社华盛顿３月７日电　美国总统布什今天表示，苏联关于裁减欧洲常规兵力的新建议是“令人鼓舞的”。
    布什总统在今天举行的记者招待会上说，在他看来，这项新方案表明苏联正向北约的常规裁军立场靠拢。
