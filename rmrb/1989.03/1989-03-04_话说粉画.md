Pastel painting is a form of art created using colored pastel pencils on specially made pastel paper of various colors. In Western painting, it is akin to oil painting and watercolor painting. Of course, each has its unique characteristics and style. If watercolor painting emphasizes the use and flavor of water, then pastel painting has its distinctive pastel texture. Some say that pastel painting is a vibrant, fragrant flower in the garden of fine arts.

Pastel painting originated in 15th-century Italy. During the Renaissance, great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo used pastel pencils for sketches and drafts. In 1720, the Venetian female painter Rosalba Carriera brought pastel painting to Paris, where it flourished and spread throughout Europe. Great painters like Boucher, Chardin, and Ladure were all enthusiastic about it, making pastel painting a social trend and reaching its first peak. In the 19th century, masters like Delacroix, Millet, Manet, and Renoir all created pastel paintings. Especially Degas and the American female painter Mary Cassatt, who pushed pastel painting to another height.

In the early 20th century, China established art schools and offered Western painting courses, laying the foundation for the development of pastel, oil, and watercolor painting in China. Before and after the May Fourth Movement, senior artists such as Yan Wenliang, Xu Beihong, Pan Yuliang, Li Chaoshi, and others engaged in pastel painting. Liu Haishu wrote a book titled "Color Pastel Painting." However, starting from the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the lack of pastel materials and various social factors, pastel painting became less popular. It was not until May 1978 that a few senior artists who were passionate about pastel painting advocated for its revival. Over the past decade, the number of pastel artists has grown from a few to over three hundred, and several local pastel painting organizations have been established, along with the publication of three pastel painting collections. Pastel painting has been included in the national salon three times. The seventh National Art Exhibition to be held in 1989 will once again include pastel painting as an exhibition item. This is a significant event marking the second decade of the revival of pastel painting activities.

　　话说粉画
    丁正献
    粉画是用颜色粉画笔在特制的各色粉画纸上所作的一种绘画，在西洋画中，它和油画、水彩画是姐妹画种。当然，它们之间还各有其特性及风貌，如果说水彩画强调水的功用和味道，那么，粉画则有其独特的粉感。有论者称粉画是美术百花园中一朵色彩明丽、气味芬芳的鲜花。
    粉画发源于十五世纪的意大利，文艺复兴时期艺术大师达·芬奇、米开朗琪罗，均曾用粉画笔作过素描和画稿；一七二○年，威尼斯女画家卡里埃拉将粉画带到巴黎，得以在法国繁衍并传遍全欧洲，当时的大画家布歇、夏尔丹、拉杜均非常热衷于此，一时间作粉画成为社会风尚，形成粉画第一个鼎盛时期；进入十九世纪后，大画家如德拉克洛瓦、米勒、马奈、雷诺阿等无不作粉画，尤其德加和美国女画家卡萨特，将粉画推到又一个顶峰。
    二十世纪初，我国兴办起美术学校，开设了西洋画课程，为粉画和油画、水彩画在我国发展奠定了基础。“五·四”前后，老一辈画家颜文梁、徐悲鸿、潘玉良、李超士……等均从事过粉画，刘海粟著有《色粉画》一书。但从抗日战争起，粉画材料来源不继和种种社会因素，粉画趋于冷落。直至一九七八年五月，经几位热心于粉画事业的老画家倡导，粉画开始振兴。十年来，粉画作者已由最初的几个人发展到三百余人，还建立了不少地方粉画组织，出版了三本粉画集。粉画已三次被列入国家沙龙，一九八九年将举办的第七届全国美展，又一次将粉画列为展出项目。这是振兴粉画活动第二个十年起步的一件大事。
