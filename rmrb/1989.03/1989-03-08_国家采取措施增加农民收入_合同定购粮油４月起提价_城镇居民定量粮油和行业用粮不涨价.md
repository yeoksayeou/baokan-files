State Takes Measures to Increase Farmers' Income
Contract Purchases of Grains and Oils to Rise in Price Starting April
Prices of Grains and Oils for Urban Residents and Industrial Use Will Not Increase

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) — Minister of Commerce Hu Ping revealed today that the state has decided to appropriately raise the procurement prices for contract-purchased grains and oils starting April 1. This price adjustment will increase farmers' income from selling grains and oils to the state by several billion yuan. However, the prices for urban residents' rationed grains and oils, as well as grains for industrial use, will not increase.

Hu Ping said that considering the current and future tight supply of grain and oil products in China, it is necessary to ensure normal supply to both urban and rural areas and to arrange for the living needs of people in disaster-stricken areas while strictly controlling grain sales. Measures must be taken to control the increase in the rationed population. Consumption should be guided actively, and the grain consumption structure should be adjusted appropriately. The production of alcoholic beverages that consume a lot of grain should be strictly controlled. The development of the "vegetable basket" project and animal husbandry should fully consider the possibility of grain supply and control grain consumption.

BEIJING, March 7 (People's Daily) — Minister of Commerce Hu Ping said at the national grain work conference today that although grain production decreased by 10.7 billion kilograms last year, by the end of January this year, the country had procured 49.25 billion kilograms of contract-purchased grains, basically completing the plan; 35.3 billion kilograms of negotiated-purchased grains, an increase of 2.5 billion kilograms compared to the same period last year.

Hu Ping pointed out that since 1985, China's grain production has stagnated for four consecutive years. In 1988, compared to 1984, grain production decreased by 13.3 billion kilograms, while the population increased by 61.39 million. The per capita grain possession decreased from 393.5 kilograms to 359 kilograms. Hu Ping said that now, grain production must be given great importance, and efforts should be made to better balance planning and market regulation.

　　国家采取措施增加农民收入
    合同定购粮油４月起提价   
    城镇居民定量粮油和行业用粮不涨价
    新华社北京３月７日电  （记者陈芸）商业部部长胡平今天透露，国家已决定从今年４月１日起适当提高合同定购粮食、食油的收购价格，这两项调价可以使农民向国家交售粮油增加几十亿元的收入。但城镇居民定量供应的口粮、食油以及行业用粮的价格不涨。
    胡平说，鉴于我国当前和今后相当一段时间粮油商品都不宽裕的国情，必须在保证城乡正常供应、安排好灾区人民生活的条件下，严格控制粮食销售。要采取切实措施，控制定量人口的增加。积极引导消费，适当调整粮食消费结构，严格控制耗粮多的饮料酒生产，对“菜篮子”工程和饲养业生产的发展，都要充分考虑粮食供给的可能性，节制粮食消费。
    本报北京３月７日讯　商业部长胡平今日在全国粮食工作会议上说，尽管去年粮食减产１０７亿公斤，但截至今年１月底，全国合同定购粮食已入库４９２．５亿公斤，基本完成了计划；议购粮食３５３亿公斤，比上年同期增加２．５亿公斤。
    胡平指出，从１９８５年以来，我国粮食连续四年徘徊，１９８８年同１９８４年相比，粮食产量减少１３３亿公斤，而人口猛增６１３９万人，一增一减，人均粮食占有量从３９３．５公斤下降到３５９公斤。胡平说，现在必须十分重视粮食生产，并要争取把计划平衡和市场调节搞得更好一些。
