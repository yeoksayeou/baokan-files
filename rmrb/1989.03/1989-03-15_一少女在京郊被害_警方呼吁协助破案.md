A young girl, approximately fifteen years old, was brutally murdered in the suburbs of Beijing. The police are calling on citizens to assist in identifying the victim and providing clues to solve the case.

The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department disclosed to reporters that the victim was about 1.5 meters tall, of average build, and had slightly dark skin. There was an old scar on her right shoulder blade. The body was found on February 11th in two locations: Liujiawosouth Village in Fengtai District and a vegetable field in Chengshousi Brigade. The body had been dismembered, and the head was missing. Near the body, the victim's clothing and shoes were found, including a green cotton-padded jacket with the brand "Jinhu," a pink round-neck sweater with three butterfly patterns embroidered on the chest, red hand-knitted cotton pants, and a pair of size 22.5 pink canvas shoes with foam soles.

Over the past month, the police have sent ten detectives to Nanjing, Zhengzhou, Changchun, and other cities to investigate.

Currently, there has been no progress in the case.

It is understood that Beijing had eight unidentified bodies last year that have yet to be identified.

    北京市公安局刑警队向记者透露，死者身高一点五零米，中等身材，皮肤微黑，右肩胛背下有一陈旧性疤痕。尸体是二月十一日分别在丰台刘家窑南里和成寿寺大队菜地内被发现的。尸体已被肢解，头颅下落不明。陈尸处还发现了死者的锦湖牌军绿色腈纶棉防寒衣一件，玫瑰色圆领毛衣一件（胸前绣有三个蝴蝶图案），朱红色手织腈纶毛裤一条及二十二点五号粉红色双眼帆布面泡沫底鞋一双等物。
    近一个月来，警方已派十名刑警分别到南京、郑州、长春等地调查。
    目前案情尚无进展。
