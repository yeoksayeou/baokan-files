Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th.

China's badminton team will send a squad combining experienced players with newcomers to compete in the 1989 All-England Badminton Open Championships, which begins on March 12th in London.

It was learned today from the Chinese Badminton Association that among the twelve male players participating in the All-England Championships, the four leading players are Yang Yang, Xiong Guobao, Tian Bingyi, and Li Yongbo. The other team members are Wu Wenkai, He Guoqian, Huang Zhen, He Xiangyang, Zheng Yumin, Huang Zhanzhong, Wang Pengren, and Jiang Guoliang.

Among the seven female players, Li Lingwei is the only veteran player, while Shang Fumei and Shi Fangqing also have some reputation. The other four players—Zhou Lei, Sun Xiaqing, Shi Xiaohui, and Nong Qunhua—are all rising stars in recent years.

The team leader is Wang Wenjiao, and the two coaches are Hou Jiachang and Qiu Yufang.

Except for Yang Yang and Xiong Guobao, who will fly directly to London to compete, the other members of the Chinese team are currently participating in an open tournament in Sweden and will then proceed to London. The All-England Badminton Championships is an international event and will provide a good opportunity for China's young players to gain practical experience.

　　中国队将参加全英羽毛球赛
    新华社北京三月七日电  中国羽毛球队将派出以老带新的阵容角逐三月十二日在伦敦开幕的一九八九年全英羽毛球公开锦标赛。
    记者今天从中国羽毛球协会获悉，在参加全英赛的十二名男选手中，杨阳、熊国宝、田秉毅、李永波四员大将打头，其余队员是吴文凯、何国权、黄震、贺向阳、郑昱闽、黄展忠、王朋仁和蒋国良。
    参赛的七名女选手中，李玲蔚是唯一资深的球员，尚幅梅和史方静也小有名气，另外四名选手——周雷、孙小青、史晓惠和农群华，则是近年来崭露头角的新秀。
    中国队的领队是王文教，两位教练为侯加昌和丘玉芳。
    除杨阳和熊国宝将直飞伦敦参赛外，中国队其他选手目前正在瑞典参加公开赛，然后转战伦敦。全英羽毛球赛是国际大赛，对中国年轻选手是一次很好的实战锻炼。
