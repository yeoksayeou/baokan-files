Lebanese factions reach temporary ceasefire agreement after repeated negotiations

BEIRUT, March 17 (Xinhua) – According to today's report by the Lebanese newspaper "Al-Watan," the leaders of various opposing factions in Lebanon have reached an agreement to cease fire for 48 hours starting from 17:30 on the afternoon of the 16th, after multiple rounds of negotiations.

This agreement was reached after multiple contacts between the transitional government of Lebanon, Prime Minister Oun, Muslim Deputy Prime Minister Hus, the leader of the Shiite "Amal" movement Berri, and the leader of the Progressive Socialist Party.

The agreement requires all factions to stop all hostile and military actions at the port.

The bloody clashes that occurred on Tuesday between the government forces led by Oun and the Progressive Socialist Party have resulted in more than 200 casualties.
