    The nation is set to rectify the automobile market and thoroughly clean up sales outlets this year while significantly reducing automobile production. Relevant departments have begun a comprehensive cleanup of existing automobile sales outlets.

    It is understood that over the past five years, domestic demand for automobiles has been excessively high, with last year being another peak year, where the total sales volume increased by over 40% compared to the previous year. However, issues such as illegal operations, smuggling, reselling, and price gouging in the circulation market have been prominent. Prices for sedans have skyrocketed, and a large number of assembled cars and obsolete models have flooded the market.

    To address these issues, the state will reform the automobile circulation system, concentrating market regulation authority with the Ministry of Materials. The authority of various departments to operate automobiles will be either canceled or weakened. During the cleanup, a batch of administrative companies that abuse power and blur the lines between government and enterprise, as well as operators who lack operating conditions and engage in illegal profiteering through price differentials, will have their licenses revoked. The sale of sedans will be strictly managed, with designated sales points, unified pricing, and the collection of consumption tax.

    In related news, approved by the Ministry of Materials, the China Automobile Trade Corporation was recently established. It will execute the distribution and supply of planned products under the direction of the Ministry of Materials, participate in market regulation, and play a leading role in the main channel.

　　国家整顿汽车市场  全面清理销售网点
    本报北京３月１３日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：我国在今年大幅度压缩汽车产量的同时，将大力整顿汽车市场。有关部门已着手对现有汽车销售网点进行全面清理。
    据悉，近５年国内汽车市场需求过旺，去年是又一个高峰年，汽车总销量比上年增长４０％以上。而流通中非法经营、进口走私、转手倒卖、哄抬价格等问题突出，小轿车价格暴涨，拼装汽车、被淘汰车型大量流入市场。
    为此，国家将改革汽车流通体制，把市场调控权集中到物资部，取消或削弱各部门的经营汽车的权力。在清理中，一批利用权力经营、政企不分的行政性公司和不具备经营条件、完全靠价差倒买倒卖非法牟利的经营户要吊销执照。对小轿车销售从严管理，实行定点经营，统一销价，征收消费税。
    又讯　经物资部批准，中国汽车贸易总公司日前成立。它受物资部委托执行指令性计划产品的分配和供应，参与市场调节，发挥主渠道作用。
