The riots in Lhasa have entered their third day. This is the largest-scale riot that Lhasa has seen in recent years. Various signs indicate that this riot was premeditated. The violent acts of a few separatist elements have posed a serious threat to the safety of life and property of all the people in the city. What follows is a record of the rioters' violent acts on March 5 and 6.

March 5 was a Sunday, and the bustling Barkhor Street, rich in ethnic characteristics, was very lively. Incense smoke wafted around the Jokhang Temple, and the stream of people spinning prayer wheels and praying did not stop.

Just after 12 noon, the crowd in front of the Jokhang Temple suddenly became agitated. About a dozen monks, nuns, and young people shouted slogans of "Tibet Independence," with one person holding a paper flag bearing the "Snow Lion" symbol of independence, and began an illegal march. Soon, the crowd swelled to over 500 people. Most of these people wore masks, and some monks and nuns were in civilian clothes. They were aggressive, shouting and cursing. The street immediately fell into chaos, vendors hurriedly packed up their stalls, shops quickly closed their doors, and some pedestrians hurriedly left.

At the door of the Barkhor Street police station and the public security service center, rioters threw stones at the police, injuring two police officers in the legs. The number of rioters attacking the police increased, and stones were thrown from the roof of the Jokhang Temple to the nearby police station. To maintain order on Barkhor Street, the police fired several tear gas canisters, temporarily dispersing the attacking and onlooking crowds. However, the rioters repeatedly incited the crowd to charge at the Barkhor Street police station and the public security service center, using yak ropes to hurl stones. The streetlamps in the central square and the glass windows of the surrounding Tibetan-style buildings were mostly shattered, and the usually peaceful Jokhang Temple square was in ruins.

Around 3 PM, the rioters regrouped and marched in three locations: Barkhor Street, Beijing East Road, and Jiri Road. The reporter saw that these rioters shouted slogans, beat, smashed, looted, and burned, and the doors and windows of more than 20 units, hotels, and restaurants were smashed. On the northern section of Guangming Road, rioters dragged beds, chairs, bicycles, luggage, and other service facilities from the Qingzhen Yimin Restaurant and three adjacent restaurants onto the street and burned them. At that time, the street was filled with thick smoke and flames. On Beijing East Road, about 500 rioters gathered and smashed the doors and windows of a primary school, hospital, and nearby individual businesses. About 300 people wearing large masks took down and smashed the nameplates of government agencies at the entrance of Chengguan District. Meanwhile, on Beijing East Road, a group of thugs beat medical personnel and looted an ambulance, then stood on the hood waving the "Snow Lion" flag. The reporter saw that rioters mixed in with the onlookers threatened the crowd to join them in causing trouble.

Around 5 PM, in the direction of Beijing East Road, the fire in the grain store set by the rioters was raging, and the wind fanned the flames, quickly spreading to nearby residential buildings and shops. Thirty-seven firefighters from the Chengguan District Fire Brigade rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. However, more than 300 rioters set up barricades at the intersection with garbage cans, blocking the firefighting efforts. They also shot at and threw stones from nearby residential buildings at the firefighters, injuring 10 firefighters, two of whom were seriously injured.

In this riot, rioters openly used firearms for the first time, shooting at police and armed police from a building near Beijing East Road. Three armed police were injured by gunfire, one of whom died from a bullet piercing his heart. According to relevant departments, the firearms used by the rioters were smuggled from abroad.

On March 6, the riots continued. That morning, around 10:30, in areas around the Jokhang Temple, the Tibetan Medicine Hospital outpatient department, Chongqing Kang, Beijing East Road, Beijing Middle Road, and the intersection of Dingzi Road, groups of 30 to 50 people dressed in Tibetan clothing, wearing new Tibetan hats, or in ordinary clothes with white headbands, harassed, cursed, and beat passersby. Rioters snatched bicycles from pedestrians and burned them, and some pedestrians were beaten until they were bloodied. A group of rioters at the intersection of Dingzi Road tore off a passerby's ear, pinned him to the ground, and beat and kicked him.

Around 2 PM, groups of 100 to 200 rioters gathered and, in a seesaw fashion, beat, smashed, looted, and burned along Beijing East Road, Beijing Middle Road, and Duosengge Road. More than 20 shops were burned down. The dormitory of the Autonomous Region's Office for Receiving Returned Tibetans and the office building of the Lhasa Urban Construction Bureau had their street-facing windows smashed by rioters. The door of the Chengguan District Administration for Industry and Commerce and some residences were burned down.

　　骚乱分子施暴记
    ——三月五日、六日拉萨街头实录
    新华社记者
    拉萨的骚乱今天进入第三天。这是近几年拉萨发生的规模最大的一次骚乱。种种迹象表明，这次骚乱是有预谋的。少数分裂主义分子的暴行，对全市人民生命财产的安全形成了严重威胁。这里报道的，是３月５日和６日骚乱分子暴行的记录。
    ３月５日是星期天，富有民族特色的八廓街上非常热闹。大昭寺前香烟缭绕，手摇玛尼轮转经朝佛的人流不断。
    １２时刚过，大昭寺广场的人群中突然一阵骚动，只见十几个喇嘛、尼姑和青年呼喊着“西藏独立”的口号，一人手举着一面标志“独立”的“雪山狮子”纸旗举行非法游行。接着，队伍突然增至５００多人。这些人多数戴着口罩，一些喇嘛、尼姑穿着便装，气势汹汹，呼喊叫骂。街上顿时大乱，商贩仓皇收摊，商店迅疾关门，一些行人慌忙离开。
    在八廓街派出所门口和治安服务站门前，骚乱分子向公安人员投掷石块，当场有两名公安干警腿部被击伤。围攻公安人员的骚乱者越聚越多，石块从大昭寺楼顶向附近的派出所飞去。为了维持八廓街的治安，公安人员施放了几颗催泪弹，将围攻和围观的人群暂时驱散。但骚乱者三番五次地鼓动群众向八廓街派出所和治安服务站冲击，用牦牛绳抛甩石块。街心广场的路灯、广场周围藏式楼房的玻璃大多被击毁，平时人们休息、散步的大昭寺广场一片狼藉。
    下午３时许，骚乱者重新纠集队伍，分别在八廓街、北京东路、吉日路三处游行。记者看到，这些骚乱者狂呼口号，打、砸、抢、烧，先后有２０多个单位、旅馆、饭店的门窗被砸。在光明路北段，骚乱分子将清真益民饭馆和毗邻的３家饭店内的床、椅、自行车、行李及其它服务设施拖到大街上烧毁。当时，大街上浓烟滚滚，烈火升腾。在北京东路，骚乱者聚集５００多人，用石块砸碎一所小学、医院和附近个体户的门窗玻璃。大约有３００个戴着大口罩的人，将城关区机关门口挂的机关牌子摘下砸毁。与此同时，在北京东路，一伙暴徒殴打救护人员并抢劫了一辆救护车，然后站在车头挥舞“雪山狮子旗”。记者看到，夹杂在围观人群中的骚乱分子威胁群众跟他们一起闹。
    下午５时许，北京东路方向，被暴徒点燃的粮店大火熊熊，风助火势，很快就会蔓延到附近的居民住房和商店。拉萨市城关区消防队的３７名队员赶至现场奋力灭火。但３００多名骚乱分子在路口用垃圾桶设置路障，阻止灭火。他们还从附近居民楼上向消防队员射击、打石头，当场有１０名队员受伤，其中两名受重伤。
    在这次骚乱中，骚乱分子第一次公开使用枪支，在北京东路附近的楼上向公安人员和武警射击。有３名武警受枪伤，其中一名因子弹穿透心脏而牺牲。据有关部门提供的情况，骚乱分子使用的枪支，有的是从国外偷运进来的。
    ３月６日继续发生骚乱。这天上午１０点多钟，大昭寺广场四周、藏医院门诊部前、冲赛康、北京东路、北京中路、丁字路口等地，身着藏装、戴着新藏帽和穿普通装、头系白条带的暴徒，三五十人一伙，见行人就起哄、谩骂、追打。暴徒抢过行人骑的自行车就烧，一些行人被打得头破血流。一伙暴徒在丁字路口将一名行人耳朵撕裂，按在地上又打又踢。
    下午２点钟左右，暴徒聚集成一二百人一伙，在北京东路和北京中路以及朵森格路拉锯式地打、砸、抢、烧，被烧毁的商店有２０多家。自治区归国藏胞接待办公室的宿舍和拉萨市城建局办公楼临街窗户被暴徒用石头砸碎。市城关区工商行政管理局的大门和一些住房被烧毁。
