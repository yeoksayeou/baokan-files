Roh Tae-woo Unilaterally Changes Nature of Mid-Term Evaluation Faces Strong Opposition from Opposition Parties

	Pyeongyang, March 14, our reporter Xu Baokang reports: Seoul news, South Korean President Roh Tae-woo unilaterally changed the nature of the "mid-term evaluation," facing strong opposition from the opposition parties and various sectors of society, the political situation has stirred up another storm.

	According to reports, Roh Tae-woo promised during last year's election, when he only received 36% of the votes, that he would conduct a "mid-term evaluation" through a national "trust vote" after one year in office. As the date for the "trust vote" approaches, the opposition parties have reached an agreement and unanimously proposed that before holding the "trust vote," the "fifth republic period corruption cases" must be resolved, and the core task of handling the "Gwangju incident" must be promoted, that is, to advance social democratization.

	Facing the challenge from the opposition parties, Roh Tae-woo on the 10th went against his previous promises, proposing that the "mid-term evaluation" does not involve the "trust vote," and that the national vote is mainly an evaluation of "policy."

	The Democratic Party believes that if the "mid-term evaluation" is not linked to the "trust issue," then the national vote is meaningless, and has decided to launch a comprehensive resistance movement.

　　卢泰愚擅改中期评价性质
    遭在野党强烈反对
    本报平壤３月１４日电  记者徐宝康报道：汉城消息，南朝鲜总统卢泰愚擅自改变“中期评价”的性质，遭到在野党和社会各界的强烈反对，政局又起风波。
    据报道，卢泰愚去年在大选时，因只获得３６％的选票，曾许诺在他执政一年时，将通过国民“信任投票”，对他进行“中期评价”。随着“信任投票”日期的临近，在野党达成协议，一致提出举行“信任投票”前，必须解决“第五共和国时期舞弊案”，处理“光州事件”的核心任务，即推进社会民主化。
    面对在野党的挑战，卢泰愚１０日一反以往的许诺，提出“中期评价”不涉及“信任投票”，国民投票主要是对“政策的评价”。
    民主党认为，“中期评价”不与“信任问题”挂钩，那么国民投票就毫无意义，并决定掀起全面抵制运动。
