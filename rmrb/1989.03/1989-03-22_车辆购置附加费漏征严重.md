Title: Severe Undercollection of Vehicle Purchase Additional Fee

The collection of the vehicle purchase additional fee has played a significant role in accelerating the construction of highways. However, since May 1, 1985, there has been a serious problem with the undercollection of this fee. It is understood that over the past four years, Chongqing City has failed to collect over 150 million yuan in vehicle purchase additional fees, accounting for 40% of the total amount that should have been collected. Due to insufficient understanding and support from relevant departments regarding the significance of collecting the vehicle purchase additional fee, as well as weak enforcement, and the lack of effective inspection methods, some units have even arbitrarily reduced or waived the collection of this fee.

It is suggested that relevant departments take measures to mobilize the enthusiasm of automobile and motorcycle manufacturers (assemblers) to collect the vehicle purchase additional fee on behalf of the government, and help them solve specific problems encountered in the collection process. Additionally, departments such as transportation supervision, public security, banking, auditing, and finance should strengthen coordination and jointly monitor and plug loopholes.

### 车辆购置附加费漏征严重

　　车辆购置附加费漏征严重
    征收车辆购置附加费，这对加快公路建设，起到了很好的作用。
    但是，自１９８５年５月１日到现在，这项费用漏征情况严重。据了解，４年来，重庆市车辆购置附加费漏征额超过１．５亿元，占应征额的４０％。由于有关方面对开征车辆购置附加费的意义认识不足，支持不够，贯彻不力，同时也因缺乏有效的检查手段，致使有的单位竟擅自减免车辆购置附加费。
    建议有关部门采取措施，调动汽车、摩托车生产（组装）厂家代征车辆购置附加费的积极性，帮助他们解决代征工作中的具体问题。另外，交通监理、公安、银行、审计、财政等部门还应加强配合，共同把关，堵塞漏洞。
