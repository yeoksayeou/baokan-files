Why Are We Always in a Hurry to Succeed?

	— Notes from the Group Discussions of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress

	By LING Zhijun, Reporter of People's Daily

	"Now we are all asking," said Jiangsu delegate Wu Rong as soon as he began, "why does this habit of rushing for quick success persist after 30 years?" I was a bit surprised. In the past two days, eight delegates from four provinces and municipalities have said almost the same thing to me, and they have reached almost the same conclusion: not only do we need to adjust the economy, but we also need to adjust the guiding ideology of economic construction.

	In the past year, "we have sung a 'four-season song'," said Fujian delegate Zhang Mingjun. "The first quarter was about stability, the second quarter was about large exports, the third quarter was about breakthroughs, and the fourth quarter was about tightening." Zhang Mingjun also believes that there is an ideology of rushing for quick success in our economic guidance.

	"The higher-ups want to double the output, the lower levels want to quadruple or quintuple it."

	"Everywhere there is an 'investment hunger,' as if it can never be satisfied."

	"The decision-makers' expectations are too high, and the common people's appetites are not small."

	The delegates are undoubtedly discussing a crucial issue. Indeed, China can no longer afford to delay. From top to bottom, everyone wants to catch up quickly. Every region, unit, and individual wants to get rich quickly, but rarely do they think about the difficulties and complexities of reform, or that China's economic development will necessarily be a long process.

	From 1988, thinking back to 1978, and then to 1958. Shandong delegate Guo Songnian said: "In 30 years, several generations have passed, but the rush for quick success remains. Today's situation is not 'unexpected'; at least two years ago, the central authorities proposed: if we cannot curb the overheated economy, we will have to undergo a major adjustment, but the temperature still rose, and the thing we tried to avoid still happened. It seems that the rush for quick success is indeed a major malady in economic construction."

	"The rush for quick success is driven by a desire for immediate gains," said Guangdong delegate Zeng Zhaoke. "Now it is an election system for officials, not a lifelong system. New officials take office, and within a few years, they naturally want to achieve something, start projects, build factories, and become rich for the people. As for paying interest and repaying loans, and the overall inflation, that is someone else's problem..."

	In the Shandong delegation, I met Yantai Mayor Yu Zhengsheng. When talking about the causes of the "overheating," he said: "There is an ideology of rushing for quick success, and there is also a mechanism for rushing for quick success. I am the mayor, and I know best the difficulties of governing a place. Without money, one cannot be a mayor. Whoever starts more projects has an easier time; whoever gives more money is more welcome. Therefore, factories oppose the government, and local governments oppose the central government. If the mechanism problem is not solved, and we rely solely on compression, the result will still be a cycle of compression and expansion."

	"In the past, economic construction rushed for quick success. Now, in rectification and adjustment, is there a rush for quick success?" asked a delegate from Heilongjiang.

	We have suffered enough from the "acute economic disease." The delegates have never been as fully aware of the difficulties of reform as they are today.

	"Reform should be prepared for a protracted war and should not expect any magic pill to take effect immediately," said Jiangsu delegate Wu Rong. "This is the greatest lesson of 1988."

　　为什么总急于求成？        
    ——七届人大二次会议分组讨论侧记
    本报记者  凌志军
    “现在我们都在问”，江苏代表吴熔一开口便说，“为什么急于求成的毛病３０年改不了？”我有些惊讶，这两天，有四个省市的８位代表对我说了几乎同样的话，而且得出几乎同样的结论：当前不仅要调整经济，而且要调整经济建设的指导思想。
    在过去一年里，“我们唱了一首‘四季歌’”，福建代表张明俊说，“一季度求稳定，二季度大出口，三季度想攻关，四季度忙紧缩”。张明俊也认为，我们在经济指导上有急于求成的思想。
    “上面要翻两番，下面要翻三番、四番”。
    “到处是‘投资饥渴症’，好像永远吃不饱”。
    “决策者的期望值太高，老百姓的胃口也不小”。
    代表们无疑正在讨论一个关键的问题。诚然，中国再也耽误不起了。从上到下，都想快点赶上去，每个地区、单位，每个人都想快快富起来，但却很少想到改革的艰难、复杂，很少想到中国的经济发展必然是一个很长的过程。
    从１９８８年回想到１９７８年，再回想到１９５８年。山东代表郭松年说：“３０年换了几茬人，仍然是急于求成。今天的局面也不是‘没有想到’，至少两年前中央就提出：如果不能遏制经济过热的势头，将会被迫来一次大的调整，可是温度照样上升，极力想避免的事情还是发生了。看来急于求成确实是经济建设中的一大顽症”。
    “急于求成的背后是急功近利”，广东代表曾昭科说，“现在是干部选举制，不是终身制，新官上任，任期几年，自然是大干一番，上项目，盖工厂，为官一场，致富一方，至于付利息、还贷款，全局的大膨胀，那是后人的事……”
    在山东代表团，我见到烟台市市长俞正声。谈到“过热”的原因，他说：“有急于求成的思想，也有急于求成的机制。我是市长，最清楚为政一方的苦处。手里没钱没法当市长，谁上项目多，谁日子就好过；谁给的钱多，谁就受欢迎，所以，工厂与政府作对，地方和中央作对。不解决机制问题，单纯靠压缩，结果还是进入压而复胀的循环圈。”
    “过去经济建设急于求成，现在治理整顿有没有急于求成的问题？”一位黑龙江代表问。
    我们已饱尝“经济急性病”之苦。代表们从来没有像今天这样充分地估价改革的困难。
    “改革宁可打持久战，不能希望什么灵丹妙药立见奇效”，江苏代表吴熔说，“这就是１９８８年给我们的最大教益。”
