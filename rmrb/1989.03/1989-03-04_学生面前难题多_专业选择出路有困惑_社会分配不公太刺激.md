Students today face numerous challenges. Choosing a major and finding a career path can be confusing, and social inequality can be particularly jarring.

I originally studied geology. In 1984, I listed geology as my first choice for the college entrance exam and was admitted to Peking University. Less than a year later, I realized something was amiss: geology was not highly regarded at Peking University or anywhere else in the country. In 1988, after graduating from Peking University, I switched to philosophy (personally, I still find geology fascinating). Some people said I had jumped out of one "frying pan" only to land in another "fire." Philosophy is no more prosperous than geology (I am still studying philosophy to this day)!

I think that every discipline has its own set of difficulties. The problem is not what we study, but how society directs us. Currently, the broader social environment is in a state of transition, and the entire education sector is like a small boat adrift in the vast sea of a market economy, with very little strength of its own.

Nowadays, there are few students who can study with a clear conscience. The renowned educator Liu DaoYu pointed out several reasons that resonate with many students. I would like to add one more point—the issue of money. For many years, the stipend for graduate students has been a mere 58 yuan per month, and with various subsidies, it barely reaches 80 yuan. After paying for food, which takes up 90% of the stipend, the remaining amount must be carefully allocated, and buying a book requires careful consideration. On the other hand, society presents us with a different picture: former classmates who stopped studying long ago are now doing quite well, spending money generously. Some people spend dozens or even hundreds of yuan on a single dance party, while we can only manage a few jumps in the cafeteria. It is said that the person selling wontons at the gate of Renmin University earns over 400 yuan a month... The stark contrast makes one feel that studying is useless and that "China does not need knowledge."

This "new theory of the uselessness of studying" is similar to the "theory of the uselessness of studying" during the Cultural Revolution, and it inevitably brings national disasters. Around 1978, people may still remember: every industry urgently needed knowledge and talent, but knowledge and talent were in short supply. Many people regretted not studying hard enough. This is not an exaggeration. Our country must immediately take measures to prevent such consequences.

To completely solve the problem of the "new theory of the uselessness of studying," I believe the key steps currently are: first, the state must genuinely prioritize education and implement practical measures, not just talk about it. For example, improving the treatment of intellectuals and not letting the "ninth category" become the "tenth category," etc. The growth rate of educational funding should be higher than that of other sectors, and the state should not focus only on immediate gains. Second, quickly reform the cadre personnel system to form a talent market and make fair competition possible. Third, grant universities autonomy and give students autonomy. Schools should set a total number of credits, and students should be free to choose their courses. Schools should introduce a competitive mechanism.

　　学生面前难题多
    专业选择出路有困惑　社会分配不公太刺激
    中国人民大学研究生  刘华杰
    我本是学地质的。１９８４年高考，我第一志愿就报了地质系，结果考入了北京大学。不到一年，就发现事情“不对头”，在北大、在全国，地质都受到轻视。１９８８年从北大毕业，我改考了哲学（对我个人来讲，地质学仍很有魅力）。有人说我刚逃出一个“火坑”又入另一个“火坑”，哲学并不比地质景气（至今我仍学着哲学）！
    我想，也许哪一学科都有难言的苦衷。问题并不在于我们学什么，而在于个人要受社会定向。目前社会大环境新旧交替，整个教育战线在商品经济的大海中犹如漂浮在海面上的一叶小舟，而它自己的力量又很软弱。
    现在能心安理得读书的学生为数不多，著名教育家刘道玉指出的几点原因道出了广大学生的心里话。这里仅补充一点——钱的问题。研究生助学金多少年来一直是每月５８元，加上各种补贴不足８０元，吃饭得用去９０％，剩下的要仔细研究如何分配，买一本书都得再三考虑。另一方面社会呈现给我们另一番景象：从前的同学早就不读书了，现在有不少都“混”得不错，花钱慷慨大方，有的人参加一次舞会要花几十元或几百元，我们自然是望尘莫及，只好在食堂里蹦跶几下了事。据说人大校门口卖馄饨的每月也赚４００多元……强烈的反差使人感觉学习没用，“中国不需要知识”。
    “新的读书无用论”与“文革”中“读书无用论”一样，伴随而来的必然是民族灾难。１９７８年左右的光景，人们也许还记忆犹新：各行各业迫切需要知识和人才，而知识和人才又是空前的匮乏，许多人后悔当初没有好好学习。这样讲决不是危言耸听，我们的国家必须立即采取措施，防止恶果发生。
    彻底解决“新的读书无用论”，我认为目前要做的关键是：一是国家切实重视教育，落到实处，不能只说不做，比如提高知识分子待遇问题，不让“老九”再变成“老十”等等。教育经费增长率要高于其它部门，国家不能只图眼前利益。二是尽快改革干部人事制度，形成人才市场，使公平竞争成为可能。三是给各大学以自主权，给学生以自主权，学校规定总学分，学生自由选课。学校要引入竞争机制。
