Recently, several incidents involving factory directors and managers in Zhejiang Province have been reported, with some already detained by judicial authorities, others undergoing investigations by over 10 departments, and some having their contracts terminated and being removed from their positions. Public opinion is abuzz. Meanwhile, including some famous entrepreneurs, factory directors and managers have been frequently gathering, expressing their grievances, with the central topic being: "Who will protect the entrepreneurs?"

A few local journalists discussed the widespread anxiety among factory directors and managers, saying: "A year ago today, the 'Bu Xinsheng incident' in Zhejiang caused a strong sense of unease among factory directors and managers. Is this just a coincidence?"

The corruption case involving a factory director in Hangzhou is the most discussed topic among factory directors and managers. This is one of the major cases in the local procuratorate's crackdown on economic crimes. The former provincial and municipal outstanding entrepreneur was accused of accepting bribes totaling over 10,000 yuan and has been detained.

Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Entrepreneurs Association held two special discussions with a group of factory directors and managers regarding this case, raising numerous doubts and demanding that the procuratorate make the case public. After one of the meetings, a famous factory director emotionally told a reporter: "It is normal to investigate and punish factory directors for law violations. Why is there so much publicity, both in newspapers and on television? Now there is a strange phenomenon where it seems that inflation and chaos are all caused by factory directors, which is unfair!"

"This is obviously an overreaction and a hypersensitive response," said several theoretical workers in Zhejiang, analyzing the situation. "This reveals the fragile psychological state of entrepreneurs today. The question is, are environmental constraints and human factors strengthening their psychological barriers and sense of insecurity?"

Unfortunately, this hypothesis seems to be confirmed. When discussing the plight of a factory director in Haining City, many factory directors and managers expressed sadness and despair. Due to accusations from a few workers, over 50 teams and 200 people from provincial and municipal party committees, governments, judicial, audit, union, supervision, and news organizations have been investigating the factory in Haining. The investigation has lasted 19 months and is still not concluded, with the factory director still under continuous investigation.

What frustrates some factory directors and managers is that the issue is no longer whether the factory director is wrong. Instead, it is because the conclusions of the various investigating teams are conflicting, with different opinions on right and wrong. Despite the authority of the investigators, none can make a final decision. It is said that the factory director in this factory can no longer bear the prolonged investigations and has vowed to resign if no conclusion is reached. Another factory director in the area, affected by this, has already resigned from his position. One factory director told a reporter, "Anyone can intervene and investigate the enterprise and its director, but no one's opinion counts. In the end, if the enterprise is ruined, who will take responsibility?!"

People have noticed that the anxious factory directors are seeking legal protection. The controversy over the removal of a factory director in Shaoxing City has already affected the legal community in Zhejiang. Recently, a well-known factory director in Shaoxing received a notice from his superiors to terminate his contract and remove him from his position. However, the factory director refused to comply, stating his disagreement. This immediately sparked a strong reaction. The Zhejiang Provincial Entrepreneurs Club invited a group of legal experts to provide legal opinions on the matter. The unanimous conclusion was that the factory director was not incompetent and had not violated laws or disciplines. In the absence of the contract's expiration, the superior department had no right to arbitrarily transfer the contract operator. The decision to transfer the factory director constituted an "illegal infringement."

However, the court currently has difficulty accepting the factory director's lawsuit. At a meeting, a leader from the Zhejiang judicial system regretted, "Using the law to protect enterprise reform still has many unresolved issues." Economic adjustments have placed enterprises at the center of various conflicts. An economic department leader said, "Studying economic issues cannot be done by only seeing things and not people. How to evaluate the status, role, and significance of entrepreneurs remains an unresolved theoretical question."

It seems that the psychological turmoil and anxiety among factory directors and managers will continue. "Being a factory director requires both patience and the willingness to make sacrifices at any time," said a famous entrepreneur after experiencing several setbacks. Is this their only choice?

    尚难解除的困扰
    ——发生在浙江厂长经理中的一场心理骚动
    本报记者　高海浩
    浙江省近来连续传出几桩有关企业厂长、经理“出事”的消息，有的已被司法机关立案拘捕，有的正在接受10多个部门的轮番调查，也有的被中止承包合同后免去职务。社会舆论沸沸扬扬。与此同时，包括一些著名企业家在内的厂长、经理们频频聚会，纷纷抱怨，集中的话题是：“谁来保护企业家”。
    当地几位报界同行谈及厂长经理中普遍流露的不安心理时说：“1年前的今天，浙江爆出‘步鑫生事件’，也在厂长经理中引起强烈不安，这难道是偶然的巧合？”
    杭州某厂厂长涉嫌受贿案是厂长经理中议论最多的话题。这是当地检察机关打击经济犯罪的大案之一，这位曾获省、市优秀企业家荣誉的厂长，被指控受贿1万多元，已被拘捕。
    最近，浙江省企业家协会连续两次召集一批厂长经理专题讨论，对此案提出诸多疑虑，并要求检察机关公开案情。一位著名厂长会后情绪激动地对记者说：“厂长违法查处，这很正常。为什么又是登报，又上电视，大做文章。现在有一种怪现象，好像通货膨胀、混乱现象都是厂长们造成的，这不公平！”
    “这显然是过激情绪和过敏反应。”浙江省的几位理论工作者就此分析说：“这暴露了目前企业家们心理状态的脆弱。而问题还在于，环境制约，人为因素，是否正在强化他们的这种心理障碍和不安全感？”
    遗憾的是，这种假设正在得到某种印证。谈及海宁市某厂厂长的遭遇，一些厂长、经理们普遍流露出悲凉和伤感。由于几位职工对厂长的一项检举指控，来自省市党委、政府、司法、审计、工会、监察和新闻单位的50多批、200多人次调查队伍，轮番前往海宁这家工厂。历时19个月，至今仍未了结，厂长还在接受不断审查。
    令一些厂长经理们沮丧的是，问题已不是厂长是否有错。而是因为各路人马结论分歧，是非不一，尽管调查者都有来头，竟然没有一个能够拍板定案。据说，这家工厂厂长已无法忍受旷日持久的轮番调查，发誓再不定论，他将辞职。而当地的另一位厂长悲之所及，已辞去厂长职务。有位厂长对记者说“谁都可以插手审查企业和厂长，谁都说了不算，最后企业搞垮了，谁来负责？！”
    人们注意到：感到不安的厂长们开始寻求法律保护。绍兴市某厂厂长的免职风波，已经波及浙江法律界。前不久，在当地颇有名气的绍兴市某厂厂长接到上级调动通知：中止承包合同，免去厂长职务。但厂长表示不服，拒绝执行。此事立即引起强烈反响，浙江省企业家俱乐部专门邀请一批法律专家，对此事进行法律论证。一致的结论是：厂长并非无力经营，也没有违法乱纪，在承包合同没有期满的情况下，上级部门无权随意调动承包经营者。调动厂长的决定已构成“侵权违法行为”。
    但法院目前毕竟难以受理这位厂长的起诉。在一次会议上，浙江省司法界一位领导谈及此事遗憾地说：“用法律保护企业改革，还有诸多难题尚未解决”。经济调整已使企业处于各种矛盾冲突的焦点。一位经济部门的领导说：“研究经济问题不能只见物不见人。如何评价企业家的地位、作用和意义，依然是一个尚未解决的理论命题。”
    看来，发生在厂长、经理中的这场心理困扰和不安仍将继续下去。“当厂长的一要善于忍耐，二要随时作出牺牲。”一位著名企业家谈到他几经挫折后如是说。难道这是他们的唯一选择？
