A market for farmyard manure has emerged in Danzhou County, Hainan.

According to reports from here, some idle laborers collect pig and cow manure daily from pigpens and grazing slopes, dry and grind it, and sell it at about 3 yuan for 50 kilograms. The Chunjiang Cow Farm, which raises over 600 cows, has several tons of dried cow manure fertilizer for sale every day. Sanitation workers also gather "combustible waste," process it into fertilizer, and sell it to users.

　　海南出现农家肥市场
    本报海口３月２３日电  记者罗自苏报道：此间消息说，海南儋县出现农家肥交易市场。
    一些闲散劳力每天从各养猪户的猪圈及放牛坡地，收集猪牛粪便，晒干研细后以５０公斤３元钱左右的价格卖出。养牛６００多头的春江牛场，每天总有数吨干牛粪肥待售。环卫工人也堆集“可燃垃圾”，成肥卖给用户。
