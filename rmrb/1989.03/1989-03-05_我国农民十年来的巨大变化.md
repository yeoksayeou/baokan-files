The significant changes in China's farmers over the past decade

First, the household contract responsibility system has been implemented, and farmers are no longer members of the people's communes. Instead, they have become the owners of the land and independent commodity producers. Across the country, there are 201,680,000 farm households, each essentially functioning as a small enterprise. This is the most fundamental change, and all other changes in the countryside stem from this.

Second, the occupational structure of China's farmers has changed. Farmers have diversified in their occupations. According to statistics from 1987, China had 857,130,000 people engaged in agriculture, but this is merely a distinction between agricultural and non-agricultural households. Among them, nearly 108,000,000 rural laborers have been engaged in or have been engaged for many years in non-agricultural industries, deriving most or all of their income from these industries. These 108,000,000 rural laborers account for approximately 7,000,000 households, making up about 35% of China's total farm households.

Third, the living standards of 800 million farmers have generally improved, with some becoming wealthy first. The income gap among farmers has widened. In 1978, the national per capita net income of farmers was only 134 yuan, with an average consumption of 496 jin of grain per person, including 245 jin of fine grain (all in raw form). The average annual expenditure on living expenses per person was 116 yuan. By 1987, the per capita net income of farmers had reached 462.55 yuan, with an average annual increase of 10%. In 1987, the average consumption of grain per farmer was 508 jin, including 422 jin of fine grain. The average annual expenditure on living expenses per person was 398.29 yuan, an increase of 282 yuan compared to 1978, with an average annual increase of 31.3 yuan, or 14.60% per year. After accounting for price factors, the annual increase was 11%. Nationwide, the basic food needs of the vast majority of farmers have been met.

Additionally, since the rural reforms, under the policy of allowing some regions and farmers to become wealthy first, a number of "ten-thousand-yuan households" have emerged in rural areas. In recent years, there have also been households with tens of millions, hundreds of millions, and even billions of yuan.

Fourth, the political and cultural qualities of farmers in the 1980s have changed significantly compared to those in the 1950s. Now, the development trend of farmers' families is increasingly towards nuclear and small families. Currently, more than 70% of household heads (family elders) in rural areas are young farmers under the age of 40. These farmers were all born after liberation and grew up in the 1960s, and their political qualities are quite different from those of farmers in the 1950s.

The cultural level of contemporary farmers has improved.

Farmers' awareness of commodity economy has greatly increased.

Farmers' traditional concepts are rapidly changing. After more than 36 years of continuous changes in land ownership and management rights, farmers' attachment to land has weakened. The concept of valuing land over migration has also changed. As long as they can leave farming, as long as they can go to the city, as long as they can make money, they will go anywhere.

### 我国农民十年来的巨大变化

　　我国农民十年来的巨大变化
    第一，实行了家庭联产承包制，农民已经不再是人民公社的社员，而是重新成了土地的主人，成了独立的商品生产者。全国２０１６８万个农户，实际成了２亿多个小小企业。这是最本质的变化，农村的一切变化都是由此流觞出来。
    第二，我国农民这个群体的职业结构已经变化了。农民在职业上已经分化了。１９８７年按统计表讲，我国有农业人口８５７１３万人，实际上这只是农业户口与非农业户口的区分。其中近１０８００万农村劳动力已经从事或已经多年从事非农产业，并从该产业中取得大部乃至全部收入。这１０８００万农村劳动力大约为７０００万户，占我国总农户的３５％。
    第三，８亿农民的生活普遍改善，一部分人已经先富起来，农民之间的收入差距拉开了。１９７８年全国农民人均纯收入只有１３４元，农民人均消费粮食４９６斤，其中细粮２４５斤（均为原粮），平均每人生活费支出是１１６元；１９８７年，农民人均纯收入达到４６２．５５元，平均每年递增１０％，１９８７年农民人均消费粮食５０８斤，其中细粮４２２斤。平均每人生活消费支出为３９８．２９元，比１９７８年增加２８２元，平均每年增加３１．３元，每年增加１４．６０％，扣除物价因素每年增加１１％。就全国范围而言，绝大部分农民的温饱问题基本解决了。
    另外，农村改革以来，在让一部分地区、一部分农民先富起来的政策引导下，农村涌现了一批“万元户”，近几年又有十几万元户、百万元户、几百万元户出现。
    第四，８０年代农民的政治素质和文化素质同５０年代相比，已经有很大不同了。现在农民家庭的发展趋向也是日渐核心家庭化和小型化。现在农村里，７０％以上的户主（家长）是４０岁以下的青年农民。这些农民都是在解放后出生、都是在６０年代以后成长起来的，他们同５０年代的农民在政治素质上有很大不同。
    当代农民文化水平提高了。
    农民的商品经济观念大大增强了。
    农民的传统观念正在迅速变化。经过这３６年多的土地所有权和经营权的不断更迭，农民对土地的感情淡薄了。农民重土轻迁的观念也改变了。只要能离农，只要能进城，只要能赚钱，哪里都去。
