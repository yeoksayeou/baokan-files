The severely polluted ocean is calling out to humanity: Enough, it's enough! If we ignore this, the situation will become irreparable! We must not wait until the last fish floats belly-up before we realize the severity of the problem.

People often think that the vast ocean can absorb everything and is indestructible. Thus, the ocean has been treated as a "universal garbage dump." Every year, two hundred billion tons of waste are dumped into the sea, ranging from bottles and cans, plastic bags, to radioactive waste and chemical poisons, and more.

The North Sea and the Baltic Sea are perhaps the most typical examples of being used as garbage dumps. These two seas are relatively shallow and enclosed. The waste dumped into them and the polluted water flowing in do not disperse easily, making the pollution more severe. Take the North Sea, for example. The Rhine, Meuse, and Elbe rivers annually discharge 380 million tons of zinc, 1.35 million tons of lead, 5,600 tons of copper, as well as arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and even radioactive waste. Coastal countries annually dump 145 million tons of general waste into it. Additionally, the North Sea is dotted with about 4,000 oil wells and 150 drilling platforms, connected by 5,000 miles of pipelines to facilities on the southern coast. The most conservative estimate is that these pipelines leak about 30,000 tons of carbon compounds into the surrounding waters annually. As a result, native species like salmon, sturgeon, oysters, ray-finned fish, and black cod have almost completely disappeared. Mass deaths of seals are also common. Scientists have found over 1,000 types of toxins in the bodies of dead seals, clearly indicating that pollution is the cause.

In early 1988, garbage barges from the New York area changed their practice of dumping waste near the coast and began dumping industrial waste in the deep sea, 106 nautical miles from the shore. However, these wastes are still affected by tides and passing ships, causing them to resurface and pollute the sea. Consequently, shrimp and crab shells, as well as fish backs, show burn-like marks, making them unsellable and unfit for consumption.

The bays of the Mediterranean Sea are littered with patches of oil slicks, rotting vegetables, and the carcasses of other animals, emitting a nauseating odor. French marine biologist Jacques Cousteau lamented the severe pollution of the once beautiful Mediterranean Sea in his book "The Wounded Sea."

Additionally, red tides pose a serious threat to the ocean. For a long time, scientists believed red tides to be a natural phenomenon, but now it is generally accepted that red tides are caused by pollutants such as pesticides and fertilizers released into the ocean by humans. These pollutants increase the levels of nitrates and phosphates in the sea, providing the necessary conditions and environment for algae to proliferate. When these algae come into contact with fish gills, they release toxins that kill the fish. In recent years, red tides in the waters around Scandinavia have caused massive fish deaths, estimated to be worth about $200 million. Scientists believe that the deaths of certain marine mammals are also related to algae.

Facing the severe ocean pollution problem worldwide, many countries are taking measures. Some European and American countries have passed laws limiting the use of chemicals like DDT and PCBs, achieving initial results. Countries along the North Sea, except for the UK, have agreed not to dump industrial waste into the North Sea. The 17 countries along the Mediterranean Sea are also working to clean up what is known as "the dirtiest water body in the world." Reports indicate that the red tide problem in the Mediterranean has been basically resolved.

However, from a global perspective, if people do not pay enough attention to ocean pollution and do not take effective measures, the problem will continue to worsen with the rapid development of industry and the continuous increase of coastal populations. We must always keep the ocean's cry in mind.

### 大海的呼喊

　　大海的呼喊
    李景卫
    遭到严重污染的海洋在向人类大声疾呼：够了，已经足够！漠然视之，局面将不可收拾！不要等到最后一条鱼翻着肚子漂上水后，再叫喊问题的严重。
    人们总以为，浩瀚的大海能包容一切，是毁不了的。于是，海洋被当成了“万能的垃圾桶”，每年往海里倾倒的垃圾达二百亿吨，从瓶瓶罐罐、塑料袋到放射性废料、化学毒品等等，无所不包。
    北海及波罗的海恐怕是被当作垃圾桶的最典型的例子。这两个海较浅而且封闭。倒入的垃圾和流进的污水不易疏散，所以污染也更严重。拿北海来说，莱茵河、默兹河和易北河每年向它注入三千八百多万吨锌、一点三五万吨铅、五千六百吨铜以及砷、镉水银，甚至还有放射性废料等；沿岸国家每年向它倾倒一点四五亿吨普遍垃圾。此外，北海海面星罗棋布着约四千口油井和一百五十个钻井平台，由五千英里长的管道与南海岸设施相连。最保守的估计是，这些管道每年向周围海域渗漏的碳氨化合物约三万吨。结果原来在北海土生土长的大马哈鱼、鲟、牡蛎、鳍刺和黑绒鳕等几乎完全消失，海豹成群死亡时有发生。科学家经解剖，发现死亡的海豹体内有一千多种毒素。海豹死亡显然是污染造成的。
    纽约地区的垃圾驳船一九八八年年初改变了在近海倾倒垃圾的作法，开始把工业废料倾倒在离海岸一百零六海里以外的深海里，但是这些废料仍然受到海潮和过往船只的冲击而泛起，污染海水。结果，虾蟹的壳上及鱼背上呈现出火烧般的痕迹，无法出售和食用。
    地中海的各海湾四处漂浮着成片的油污、发霉的蔬菜以及其他动物的尸体，散发出令人作呕的怪味。法国海洋学家雅克·库斯托在他撰写的《受伤的海》一书中，为昔日美丽可爱的地中海被严重污染而深感痛惜。
    此外，红潮也对海洋构成严重威胁。长期以来，科学家们认为红潮是一种自然现象，但现在一般人都认为，红潮是人类排放到海洋里的污染物，如农药、化肥等造成的。这些污染物使海水里的硝酸盐和磷酸盐大量增加，为海藻的繁衍提供了物质条件和创造了生存环境。而这种海藻一接触到鱼腮就释放毒素，致鱼于死。斯堪的纳维亚一带的海域近年来出现的红潮造成鱼类大量死亡，估计价值约二亿美元。科学家们认为，某些海洋哺乳动物的死也与海藻有关。
    面对世界范围内的海洋严重污染问题，许多国家在采取措施。一些欧美国家通过法令，限制诸如滴滴涕、多氯联二苯等化学药品的使用取得了初步效果。北海沿岸的国家除英国外，一致同意不再向北海水域倾倒工业废料。地中海沿岸的十七个国家也在设法治理被称为“世界上最脏水域”的污染。据报道，地中海的红潮问题已基本解决。
    但从全球范围来看，如果人们对海洋污染缺乏足够的重视，不采取有效的对策，那么随着工业的迅速发展和沿海地区人口的不断增加，海洋的污染问题还会继续恶化。我们应当把大海的呼喊时刻放在心上。
