Shanghai has begun a comprehensive adjustment of its industrial product structure, marking the start of a new historical period for Shanghai's industry.

Shanghai's industrial product adjustments have been in preparation for many years, and the conditions are now ripe. Mayor Zhu Rongji emphasized: "We have made up our minds to fight a decisive battle. The earlier we adjust, the more proactive we will be. The later we adjust, the more passive we will be. If we do not adjust, there will be no way out." Shanghai will adapt to the new situation, vigorously develop excellent products, eliminate a batch of outdated products, and some enterprises will be closed, merged, or transformed. In the next two years, 220 products will be prioritized for development, 100 products will be phased out, and 200 construction projects will be prioritized, especially focusing on products that save raw materials and energy.

The municipal government has made many policy regulations to achieve this strategic goal: energy, raw materials, and funds will be concentrated on excellent products, and effective economic policies will be formulated. Products listed for restricted production shall not be arbitrarily expanded in production, nor shall they be spread to suburban counties under any name. Products listed for elimination shall not be transferred, and all preferential policies enjoyed in the past will be abolished. If production continues, all profits will be confiscated. Closure, merger, and transformation will prioritize merger and transformation. For "merger and transformation" enterprises, tenders can be conducted, or auctions can be held.

　　上海工业背水一战  产品厉行选优汰劣
    本报上海３月１５日电  记者章世鸿报道：上海开始全面调整工业产品结构，这标志上海工业将进入新的历史时期。
    上海的工业产品调整已准备了多年，目前条件已经成熟。朱镕基市长强调指出：“我们下了背水一战的决心，早调整早主动，晚调整要被动，不调整没有出路。”上海将适应新形势，大力发展优秀产品，淘汰一批落后产品，一部分企业将关停并转。今明两年，将优先发展２２０个产品，淘汰１００个产品，优先安排２００个建设项目，特别将以节约原材料、能源的产品为突破口。
    市府对实现这一战略目标作了许多政策规定：能源、原材料、资金将集中用于优秀产品，制定有效的经济政策。凡列入限量生产的产品不得擅自扩大生产，也不得以任何名义向郊县扩散。凡列为淘汰产品的，一律不得转移，过去享受的优惠政策一律废除，如继续生产，将没收其全部利润。关停并转，以并转为主。对“并转”的企业可以实行招标，也可以拍卖。
