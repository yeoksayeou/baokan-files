Sudan's Supreme Council has drafted a seven-point political plan, aiming to establish a new coalition government involving various parties by next Monday to overcome the current political crisis.

This plan was formulated after the Supreme Council held a meeting with various political parties and trade unions on the 2nd.

Vice-Chairman of the Supreme Council, Idris Banna, told reporters that the leader of the largest ruling party, the Umma Party, and Prime Minister, Sadiq al-Mahdi, has agreed to this plan. According to the plan, al-Mahdi will announce his resignation on the 5th, and a new government will be formed on the 6th.

However, the Secretary-General of the National Islamic Front, one of the parties in the current coalition government, and Deputy Prime Minister, Hassan al-Turabi, said his organization supports the Democratic Unionist Party, which withdrew from the cabinet last December, to join the new government. But he rejected the peace agreement signed by the Democratic Unionist Party with the southern rebel forces. Turabi also expressed opposition to the Sudanese Communist Party and trade unions joining the cabinet, stating that they are "not qualified."

This political crisis in Sudan was triggered on February 21st when 300 officers submitted an ultimatum to the government. The military demands the formation of a broad-based government and the achievement of domestic peace.

　　苏丹最高委员会草拟七点政治计划
    争取下周成立各党派新的联合政府
    新华社喀土穆３月３日电  苏丹国家最高委员会经协商草拟了一份７点政治计划，争取在下星期一成立一个有各党派参加的新的联合政府，以克服目前的政治危机。
    这项计划是最高委员会２日同各政党和工会组织举行会议之后制订的。
    最高委员会副主席伊德里斯·班纳对记者说，最大的执政党乌玛党领导人兼政府总理迈赫迪已表示接受这项计划。根据这项计划，迈赫迪将于５日宣布辞职，６日成立新政府。
    但是，目前联合政府执政党之一的全国伊斯兰阵线总书记兼内阁副总理图拉比说，他的组织支持去年１２月退出内阁的联合民主党参加到新政府中来，但拒绝它同南方反政府力量签订的和平协议。图拉比还表示反对苏丹共产党和工会组织入阁，因为它们“不够资格”。
    苏丹的这场政治危机是２月２１日由３００名军官签名向政府提出一份最后通牒而引起的。军方要求组成一个基础广泛的政府和实现国内和平。
