Canada to Engage in High-Level Contacts with the PLO
Canada Praises PLO's Efforts for Middle East Peace

Canada's Foreign Minister, Clark, hinted yesterday in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that Canada will soon engage in high-level official contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO).

He praised PLO leader Arafat for making "courageous and constructive" efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East.

Canada is currently the only Western power that has not held high-level meetings with the PLO. Its contacts with the PLO are limited to mid-level officials.

Clark pointed out that Canada's role in the Middle East and its position in the Security Council might be affected by not recognizing the PLO at a high level.

However, a senior official in Mulroney's office said that Mulroney has not initiated a special process to elevate the level of contacts with the PLO.

　　加巴将进行高级接触
    加拿大称赞巴解为中东和平所作的努力
    新华社渥太华３月９日电  加拿大外长克拉克昨天在接受加拿大广播公司采访时暗示，加拿大将会很快同巴解组织进行高级的官方接触。
    他称赞巴解组织领导人阿拉法特为实现中东地区和平作出了“勇敢的和富有建设性的”努力。
    加拿大是迄今唯一没有同巴解组织进行高级会晤的西方大国。它同巴解的接触限制在中级官员的水平。
    克拉克指出，加拿大在中东的作用和在安理会的地位可能会因在高层级别上不承认巴解组织而受到影响。
    然而，一位马尔罗尼总理办公室的高级官员说，马尔罗尼并非开始了提高与巴解组织接触级别的特殊进程。
