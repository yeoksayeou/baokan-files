The declaration from the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) summit indicates that, with the progress of European integration, the association will work with the European Community (EC) to establish a new partnership: existing cooperation will be expanded and deepened, new areas of cooperation will be further explored, the association will strengthen its political and organizational capabilities, and establish joint decision-making and management bodies with the EC. Both sides will strive to achieve the common goal of a "unified European economic area."

This is the first time the EFTA summit has specifically discussed strengthening cooperation with the EC in the integration process. Since its establishment in 1960, the EFTA's relationship with the EC has gone through several stages. Initially, the relationship was quite cool. In the early 1970s, the association's member countries reached a series of free trade agreements with the Community. In the 1980s, both sides were no longer satisfied with the established relationship and, in 1984, jointly issued a declaration in Luxembourg proposing the idea of a "unified and dynamic European economic area" that includes the 18 member countries of both organizations. Since then, cooperation between the two organizations has steadily developed. From the beginning of 1984, both sides have completely abolished tariffs on industrial goods and certain agricultural products. The EC and EFTA have become a free trade area accounting for more than 40% of the world's total trade.

After the EC set the goal of achieving an "internal unified market" by 1992, the EFTA countries felt pressure, fearing exclusion from the unified market. The EFTA member countries are all wealthy nations, and they are heavily dependent on the EC economically, so they hope to strengthen cooperation with the EC to ensure that their trade and industry can compete on equal terms with EC member countries. As Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland said, "This meeting sends a signal that we are willing to further cooperate with the EC."

The EC also recognizes the need to re-evaluate its relationship with the EFTA and its member countries. Due to differences in organizational structure and policies, there are still many issues in the current cooperation between the two major organizations. The EC hopes to establish a "mutual" and "equal" cooperative relationship with the EFTA. It demands that the EFTA "speak with one voice, not six." However, compared to the EC, the EFTA organization is quite loose, with its member countries insisting on their own positions and seeking cooperation with the EC. To this day, there has been no common trade policy, nor has a common arbitration body been established. Therefore, further cooperation between the two major organizations still faces some obstacles.

At the beginning of this year, EC Commission President Jacques Delors, in a speech to the European Parliament, invited the EFTA to establish a "joint institution that can make decisions and manage together" to form a "new type of structural link." This speech has caused a strong reaction in EFTA countries. In addition, enterprises and unions in EFTA countries have also called for accelerating the pace of cooperation with the EC.

However, due to economic and political factors, cooperation within the EFTA is not easy. When it comes to specific issues, it still requires a lot of effort, especially in establishing a common decision-making and management body. The future development direction of the EC is not yet clear, whether it will develop towards Delors' "European Federation" or the loose cooperation advocated by Margaret Thatcher is still undecided. This is also a constraint on the development of cooperation between the two organizations. EFTA member countries are more interested in Thatcher's proposal.

The foreign ministers of the EC and EFTA are scheduled to hold a formal ministerial joint meeting in June this year to specifically discuss measures to further strengthen cooperation. Observers believe that the strengthening of cooperation between the two major economic organizations in Europe will definitely have a significant impact on the future of Europe.

　　努力建立统一的欧洲经济区
    ——评欧洲自由贸易联盟首脑会议
    本报记者  顾耀铭
    欧洲自由贸易联盟首脑会议的声明表明，随着欧洲一体化进程的发展，联盟将同欧共体努力建立一种新的伙伴关系：双方现有的合作将扩大并将深化，新的合作领域将进一步开拓，联盟将从政治和组织上加强力量，同欧共体建立联合的决策和管理机构，双方将为实现“统一的欧洲经济区”共同目标作出努力。
    联盟首脑会议专门讨论加强与欧共体在一体化进程中的合作问题，这还是第一次。欧洲自由贸易联盟自１９６０年成立以来，与欧共体的关系发展经历了几个阶段。最初，彼此关系比较冷淡。７０年代初，联盟的各个成员国与共同体达成了一系列自由贸易协定。进入８０年代后，双方不再满足于已建立的关系，于１９８４年在卢森堡联合发表宣言提出建立包括两个组织１８个成员国在内的“统一的、有活力的欧洲经济区”的合作构想，从此两个组织的合作得到了稳步的发展。从１９８４年初起，双方已完全取消了工业品和某些农产品的关税，欧共体和欧洲自由贸易联盟已成为一个占世界贸易总额４０％以上的自由贸易区。
    欧共体确立了１９９２年实现“内部统一大市场”的目标后，联盟国家感到了压力，担心被排斥在统一市场之外，联盟的成员国都属于富国，加上在经济上对欧共体依赖很深，因此希望能同欧共体加强合作，使联盟国家的贸易和工业能够在同等条件下同欧共体成员国竞争。正如挪威首相布伦特兰夫人说的那样：“这次会议发出了我们愿意进一步和欧共体合作的信号。”
    欧共体也意识到需要重新考虑与联盟及其成员国的关系。由于组织体制和政策等方面的差异，目前两大组织的合作尚存在不少问题。欧共体希望同联盟建立“互惠”、“平等”的合作关系，它要求联盟“能用一个声音表达，而不是六个声音”。然而，与欧共体相比，联盟组织显得很松散，其成员国坚持各自立场，寻求同欧共体的合作，至今尚没有形成共同的贸易政策，也没有建立共同的仲裁机构。因此，两大组织的进一步合作还存在一些障碍。
    今年年初欧共体委员会主席德洛尔在欧洲议会的讲演中邀请联盟就两个组织通过建立“能共同作出决定和管理的联合机构”以形成一种“新型的结构联系”。这个讲话在联盟国家中引起了强烈的反响。此外，联盟国家的企业、工会也纷纷要求加速同欧共体的合作步伐。
    但由于经济、政治因素的制约，联盟内部的合作并非易事。落实到具体问题上仍要费周折，特别是在建立共同的决策和管理机构方面困难更大些。欧共体未来的发展方向尚不明确，是朝着德洛尔的“欧洲联邦”，还是撒切尔夫人主张的松散合作方向发展尚未成定局，这对两个组织的合作发展也是个制约因素。联盟成员国对撒切尔夫人的主张更为感兴趣。
    欧共体和欧洲自由贸易联盟两组织的外长定于今年６月正式举行部长联席会议，具体商讨进一步加强合作的措施。观察家们认为，欧洲两大重要经济组织加强合作，对于欧洲的未来肯定会产生重大影响。
