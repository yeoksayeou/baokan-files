	Ode to the Clear Spring
		Li Runxin

	I have loved clear springs since I was young. Every time I see a clear spring, I am captivated by it. Look at that pool of clear water, as clear as a mirror, as green as jade. Around the clear spring, bushes grow thickly, wild grass flourishes, and flowers bloom vibrantly.

	People living in the desert love clear springs with the same fervor as they love their own lives. Clear springs gush out from the ground; they are the milk of Mother Earth, nourishing all things and all life. Where there is a clear spring, there is an oasis, there is human habitation. Vast deserts are irrigated and transformed by clear springs. Clear springs silently nourish the sandy soil, day and night weaving a green carpet of grass and flowers on the desert, expanding the oasis day by day, shrinking the desert day by day. Without clear springs, there would be no oasis, and the desert would forever be a sea of sand. Who in the world likes the desert?

	If the clear spring dries up, people have no choice but to relocate, taking their children and leaving their hometowns to seek new clear springs and new oases. Camels, the heroic ships of the desert, possess an extraordinary ability: they can sniff out the location of clear springs in the boundless sea of sand and identify the location of oases, carrying people stranded in the desert to the edge of the clear spring, allowing them to settle down in new oases.

	The bonds of kinship, comradeship, and teacher-student relationships among people are like the clear springs of the world. They flow gently into people's hearts, filling the world with human warmth and beauty, allowing us to feel the refreshing green of clear springs in the barren desert of materialism.

	May each person's heart have an ever-flowing clear spring; may we all use our own clear springs to irrigate the hearts of others, letting the clear waters flow to distant lands, expanding the oases to distant lands, expanding...

### 清泉吟

　　清泉吟
    李润新
    我从小就爱清泉。每次看见清泉，就被它迷住，看那汪汪一泉清水，澄如镜，碧似玉。清泉边，灌木丛生，野草勃发，鲜花怒放。
    住在沙漠的人，爱清泉的感情就如同爱自己的生命一样。清泉，从地下冒出来，它是大地母亲的乳汁啊，它哺育着万物，哺育着生命。哪里有清泉，哪里就有绿洲，哪里就有人烟。广阔无垠的沙漠，靠清泉来灌溉，靠清泉来改造。清泉默默地滋润着沙土，日夜不停地用芳草和鲜花编织着绿毯，铺在沙漠上，绿洲一天天扩展着，沙漠一天天缩小着。没有清泉，便没有绿洲，沙漠将永远是一片沙海。在人间，谁喜欢沙漠呢？
    若清泉干涸了，人们就只好搬迁，拖儿带女，离乡背井，去寻觅新的清泉，新的绿洲。骆驼，英雄的沙漠之舟，它有一种非常了不起的本领，就是能在漫无边际的沙海中嗅到清泉之所在，辨出绿洲之所在，把困在沙海中的人驮到清泉边。使人们得以在新的绿洲中安家落户。
    人与人之间同胞情、战友情、师生情，就是人世间的清泉，它汩汩流入人的心田，使人间充满了人情美、人性美，使我们在拜金主义的沙荒中感受到春光明媚的清泉绿色。
    但愿每个人的心底，都有一个永不枯竭的清泉；但愿我们每个人都能用自己的清泉，去浇灌他人的心田，让清源流向远方、远方，让绿洲向远方扩展，扩展……
