The State Supervision Department, in conjunction with the China Petrochemical Corporation and the Yanshan Petrochemical Corporation, recently investigated and dealt with a case of violating financial discipline. The principal responsible party, Director Wu Lianke of the Yanshan Polyester Factory, was removed from his position as director and received a serious warning within the party.

Wu Lianke directly extracted 82.2 tons of polyester chips from the production line and used 22.2 tons to exchange with a wool factory for 4,982.9 meters of wool-polyester fabric, which was distributed to all the workers in the factory. The remaining 60 tons were sold to Jiangsu under the pretext of paying "rush fees" to construction units at a price of 5,700 yuan per ton, earning a profit of 342,000 yuan, all of which was included in off-book income. Of this, 204,000 yuan in cash was stored in the factory's small fund, and 138,000 yuan was recorded in the accounts of the purchasing factory, serving as the factory's off-book fund.

Wu Lianke also violated national price regulations in sales activities, selling products at prices above the regulated rates and using cash or having purchasing factories buy goods to avoid supervision by price and tax departments. According to relevant departments, from December 1986 to August 1988, the factory used the above methods to sell more than 4,000 tons of polyester products, illegally obtaining sales revenue and price differentials totaling 3933,000 yuan. Wu used 1,973,000 yuan of this amount to distribute bonuses and goods excessively and to purchase rationed materials.

　　建立帐外小金库　滥发奖金和实物
    燕化聚酯厂厂长被撤职
    本报北京３月１８日讯  记者舒瑜报道：国家监察部会同中国石化总公司、燕山石化公司，近日查处了一起违反财经纪律案，主要责任者燕化聚酯厂厂长吴连科受到撤销厂长职务和党内严重警告处分。
    吴连科先后直接从成品生产线上提取聚酯切片８２．２吨，用其中的２２．２吨与毛纺厂兑换毛涤布料４９８２．９米，分给全厂职工。其余６０吨，以支付施工单位“赶工费”为由，以每吨５７００元的价格销往江苏，获利３４．２万元全部归入计划外收入，其中２０．４万元所收现金存入厂内小金库，１３．８万元挂在购货厂家的帐上，作为聚酯厂的帐外小金库。
    吴连科还在销售业务中，违反国家的价格规定，价外加价销售产品，对加价部分的收入采用收取现金或由购货厂家代购实物的办法，以躲避物价、税收部门的监督。据有关部门查实，从１９８６年１２月至１９８８年８月，该厂采用上述手段共销售聚酯产品４０００多吨，非法获取销售款和差价款３９３．３万元，吴动用其中的１９７．３万元滥发奖金实物，购买控购物资。
