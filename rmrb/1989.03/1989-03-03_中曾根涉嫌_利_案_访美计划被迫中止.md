Former Prime Minister Nakasone Suspends U.S. Visit Amid "Recruit Cosmos" Stock Scandal

NEW YORK, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro today suspended his U.S. visit due to his involvement in the "Recruit Cosmos" stock scandal.

This was announced by Morishita Gen'ei, the leader of Nakasone's faction, to the press.

According to local newspapers, the arrested former president of Recruit Cosmos, Okuda Hiroshi, had extensively bribed politicians and high-ranking government officials by transferring unlisted stocks, aiming to gain political and business advantages. During Nakasone's administration, in September 1987, Okuda transferred a total of 29,000 shares of such stocks to Nakasone's secretaries. Opposition parties suspect that Okuda's appointment as a member of the government's Tax System Research Commission and the sale of a supercomputer from the American company Cray to Recruit Cosmos by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation might be related to Nakasone's intervention.

Nakasone held a press conference yesterday to address his involvement in the Recruit Cosmos stock scandal. He vehemently denied any connection to the aforementioned incidents. Today, during the budget committee's deliberation of the new fiscal year's budget in the House of Representatives, opposition party members demanded that Nakasone testify.

Nakasone was originally scheduled to visit the U.S. on February 28 to deliver speeches at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University. Given the domestic situation, he ultimately decided to suspend his U.S. visit.

The Recruit Cosmos stock scandal primarily occurred during Nakasone's administration. Therefore, people are closely watching the developments.

    中曾根涉嫌“利”案
    访美计划被迫中止
    新华社东京3月1日电  因涉嫌“利库路特公司股票案”，前首相中曾根康弘今天中止他的访美计划。
    这是中曾根派的领袖森下元晴向报界宣布的。
    据此间报纸报道，已经被捕的利库路特公司前董事长江副浩正以转让未公开上市股票的形式广泛地向政治家和政府高级官员行贿，以谋取政治上和商业上的利益。中曾根内阁时期，1987年9月，江副浩正曾向中曾根首相的秘书等转让了共29000股这种股票。在野党怀疑，江副浩正就任政府税制调查委员会委员之职和日本电信电话公司向利库路特公司转卖从美国克雷公司购买的超级计算机是否与中曾根的干预有关。
    中曾根昨天专就他与利库路特公司股票案的关系举行记者招待会。他断然否认自己与上述两件事情有牵连。今天，在众院预算委员会审议新年度预算时，在野党议员要求中曾根出席会议作证。
    中曾根原定于2月28日赴美访问，在麻省理工学院和耶鲁大学发表演讲。鉴于国内这种形势，他终于作出了中止访美计划的决断。
    利库路特公司股票案主要发生在中曾根内阁时期。因此，人们正在注视着事态发展。
