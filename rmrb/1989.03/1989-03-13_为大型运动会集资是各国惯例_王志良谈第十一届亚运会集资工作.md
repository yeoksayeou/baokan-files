Fundraising for major sports events is an international norm – Wang Zhiliang on the fundraising work for the 11th Asian Games

Wang Zhiliang, the director of the fundraising department for the 11th Asian Games, recently accepted an interview with a reporter. He said: Fundraising for major sports events has been a common practice for host countries in the past. We should change our old mindset and contribute more to the 11th Asian Games.

He introduced that over the past two years, people's views on the fundraising work for the Asian Games have not been entirely consistent. Some people think that China is still poor, so why should we host the Asian Games to show off? Some believe that the reason for fundraising is due to the country's financial difficulties; some doubt whether the Asian Games can be successfully held, and so on.

Regarding this, Wang Zhiliang believes: Fundraising for major sports events has been a common practice for many host countries in the past. For example, the previous Asian Games have used methods such as issuing lottery tickets to raise funds, and countries like the United States and the Soviet Union have also conducted public fundraising when hosting the Olympics. Generally, the host government itself contributes about one-third to two-thirds of the funds. Therefore, whether or not to raise funds does not necessarily reflect the wealth or poverty of the host country; it is not a simple matter of financial strength. Fundraising for major sports events has two main purposes: first, it can enhance international friendship. For other countries, regardless of whether the host country lacks money or resources, providing assistance shows a sense of concern and goodwill; second, it can mobilize the domestic people to care about and participate in the hosting of the sports event. Generally, people pay more attention to things for which they have contributed labor or resources.

As for China's fundraising for the 11th Asian Games, Wang Zhiliang believes that, in addition to the two points mentioned above, there is another important significance. He said: In the past, our country has been accustomed to having the state take care of all big and small matters, including sports activities. Most people are just spectators, and this situation needs to be reformed. This time, our country is hosting the Asian Games, with funds coming from the state budget, local self-raising, and domestic and foreign public fundraising. The state, local governments, groups, and individuals jointly host the event, and overseas Chinese people contribute their strength. This in itself is a worthwhile reform.

Wang Zhiliang revealed that the Asian Games have already raised 280 million yuan. He hopes that all sectors of society can view the fundraising work for the Asian Games with a correct mindset, "those who have money contribute money, those who have people contribute people, and those who have wisdom contribute wisdom." Let everyone's patriotism, which is deeply hidden in their hearts, be reflected in their actions, and work together to successfully host the 11th Asian Games.

　　为大型运动会集资是各国惯例
    ——王志良谈第十一届亚运会集资工作
    第十一届亚运会集资部部长王志良日前接受记者采访时说：为大型运动会集资是过去各主办国的惯常做法，我们应该转变旧观念，为第十一届亚运会集资多作贡献。
    他介绍说，两年多来，人们对亚运会集资工作看法不尽一致。有人认为，中国还很穷，何必打肿脸充胖子去主办亚运会；有的认为，集资的原因是由于国家财力不支；有的对能否办好亚运会表示怀疑，等等。
    对此，王志良认为：为举办大型运动会进行集资，是过去许多主办国的惯例。比如，前届亚运会都曾运用发行彩票等形式搞过集资，美、苏等国主办奥运会也都搞了民间集资。一般说，主办者政府自己大约出资１／３到２／３。可见，是否搞集资并不一定反映主办国的穷富，不是个简单的财力问题。大型运动会集资，一是可以加强国际间友好往来。对于别的国家来说，主办国不管是否缺钱少物，助上一臂之力，表达一种关切和友好的美意；二是可以动员国内人民都来关心和参予运动会的举办。大凡人们对自己付出劳动或财物的事情，其关注程度会更高。
    至于我国为举办第十一届亚运会而集资，王志良认为，除上述两点外，还有一个重要意义。他说：过去我国已习惯了凡大事小事都由国家包起来，包括体育活动。大部分人只是旁观者，这种状况需要改革。此次我国主办亚运会，资金由国家财政出一部分，北京地方自筹一部分，国内外民间集资一部分。国家、地方、集团、个人共同承办，海内外炎黄子孙鼎力相助，这本身就是一个值得欣喜的改革。
    王志良透露，目前亚运会已集资２．８亿人民币。他希望社会各界能够以正确的观点看待亚运会的集资工作，“有钱出钱，有人出人，有智出智”，把大家深藏于内心的爱国热情体现在行动上，同心协力办好第十一届亚运会。
