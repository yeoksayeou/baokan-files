County Committees Must Not Relax Party Discipline Construction: Lessons from Pingxiang's Transformation

Pingxiang County in Hebei Province is a well-known poor county. The original county committee leadership was weak and scattered, with serious bureaucratism, and had been severely criticized twice by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission. In August 1987, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee decided to reorganize the county's leadership. The new county committee, after taking office, focused on improving party discipline and social ethics, leading the people to abide by laws and regulations, work hard, and strive for prosperity. After more than a year of effort, the economy has seen significant development, and the county has begun to shake off its poverty and backwardness.

Due to the serious bureaucratism and irresponsible work of the original county committee, the county saw a rampant trend of producing and selling counterfeit bicycles over several years, leading to chaotic economic order. Many party members were involved in these illegal activities. In Huohong Village, 51 out of 53 party members were involved in assembling and selling counterfeit bicycles. Some government agencies, state-owned, and collective enterprises also turned a blind eye to these illegal activities, with some officials directly participating in the sales. This not only severely damaged the interests of the state and consumers but also tarnished the party's image and social ethics. The original county committee did not only turn a blind eye to these issues but even named 11 township and village party secretaries, who were heavily involved in counterfeit activities, as outstanding party members or awarded them for their achievements. The facts proved that the Pingxiang County Committee at that time had lost its fighting spirit. After an investigation by the Hebei Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission and a recommendation, the Provincial Party Committee approved the adjustment of the Pingxiang County Committee in August 1987.

After taking office, the new county committee, through deep reflection, realized that the counterfeit bicycle case and other serious economic problems in Pingxiang were merely symptoms. The root cause was the county committee's incorrect ideology and the improper relationship between economic construction and party discipline construction. Problems in party discipline indeed exist and cannot be avoided. Avoiding them would only lead to more problems, delaying work and affecting the overall reform.

After reaching a consensus, the new county committee insisted on simultaneously focusing on reform and economic development, and party discipline construction. The county committee strengthened leadership, implementing a responsibility system where county-level leaders are responsible for townships, township leaders for villages, and party members for households. They also included stopping the counterfeit trend and guiding farmers to abide by laws and strive for prosperity in the evaluation criteria for various levels of leadership and each party member. For units that failed to stop the illegal economic activities, the responsible party members and officials would be held accountable.

The goal of strengthening party discipline is to promote economic prosperity and common wealth. The new county committee, while conducting legal and moral education, seriously investigating and dealing with illegal and disciplinary cases, and strengthening internal and external supervision, actively helped the people find legitimate ways to get rich. They established 10 advanced examples, including the party committee of Xunzhao Township, the party branch of Doufengma Village, and farmer entrepreneurs Xu Tongkao and Pan Baoji, who led the people to operate legally and work hard to get rich. The county committee secretary and county mayor hung honor plaques for them. The county committee and government functional departments provided services in information, technology, funds, materials, and other aspects to actively support the development of legitimate township enterprises and family industries, solving the difficulties that arose during the transformation process. Through guiding the people to stop the illegal activities and promoting hard work and prosperity, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the county in 1988 increased by about one billion yuan compared to the previous year. Officials and the people could not help but sigh: Good party discipline has brought vitality to Pingxiang.

　　县委绝不能放松党风建设，这就是——
    平乡变化的启示
    冀纪　仲吉宗
    河北省平乡县是个有名的穷县。原县委领导班子软弱涣散，官僚主义严重，曾两次受到河北省委、省纪委的严厉批评，１９８７年８月河北省委决定改组了这个县的领导班子。新的县委班子任职后，从抓党风和社会风气入手，带领群众遵纪守法，勤劳致富，经过一年多的努力，经济有较大的发展，开始摆脱贫穷落后的面貌。
    由于原县委官僚主义严重，工作不负责任，几年期间，全县城乡生产、销售假冒自行车的歪风盛行，经济秩序混乱。许多党员也参与这种违法活动。霍洪村５３名党员中竟有５１名参与组装倒卖假冒自行车活动。一些机关、国营和集体企业也为不法分子大开绿灯，有的干部也直接参与倒卖。这不仅严重损害了国家和消费者的利益，而且也败坏了党风和社会风气。原县委对此不仅放任不管，甚至把假冒活动严重的乡、村党委书记、支部书记共１１人命名为县优秀党员，或记功授奖。事实证明，当时的平乡县委已丧失了应有的战斗力，经河北省纪委调查并建议，省委批准，于１９８７年８月调整了平乡县委班子。
    县委新班子上任后，经过深刻反思，认识到平乡冒牌自行车案和其它严重经济问题只是一种现象，实质反映出县委的思想不端正，经济建设与党风建设的关系没有摆正。党风方面的问题确实存在，想绕是绕不开的，想回避也是回避不了的，回避的结局必然酿成更多的问题，以至贻误工作，影响改革全局。
    新县委统一认识后，坚持一手抓改革和经济，一手抓党风建设，县委加强领导，实行县级领导包乡、乡领导包村、党员包户的责任制，并把狠刹假冒歪风、引导农民守法致富列入创业立功和对各级班子、每个党员的考核内容，对一些单位经济活动中的歪风制止不力，就要追究有关党员干部的责任。
    抓党风建设，目的是促进经济繁荣、共同致富。平乡县委新班子在开展法纪和道德教育、严肃查处违法乱纪案件、加强党内外监督的同时，还积极帮助群众开辟正当致富门路。他们先后树立了寻召乡党委、豆冯马村党支部和农民企业家徐同考、潘保计等１０个带领群众依法经营、勤劳致富的先进典型。县委书记、县长为他们挂光荣匾。平乡县委、县政府职能部门，分别从信息、技术、资金、物资等方面，积极为发展正当的乡镇企业、家庭工业提供服务，切实解决转产过程中出现的困难。通过引导群众堵刹歪风，促进勤劳致富的活动，１９８８年全县工农业总产值比上年增加一亿元左右。干部、群众无不感慨地说：好党风给平乡带来了生机。
