A Japanese voiceprint expert has recently developed a voice analyzer for individuals. This device can determine within a few seconds whether a bank customer is impersonating an account holder after the customer has spoken a few sentences. This expert was previously a researcher at the police research center. He confirmed that "voiceprints" are highly unique, much like human fingerprints. This voice analyzer can replace identification cards, coded cards, and other forms of identification used by bank customers for deposits and withdrawals.

　　声音证件
    日本一声学专家不久前研制出一种人的声音分析器，它能够在银行顾客说过几句话后几秒钟内，确定出该人是否冒充存户。这位专家曾是警察科研中心的研究员。他确认，“声音痕迹”十分独特，就如同人的指纹一样。这种声音分析器可以代替银行存户存取钱款时使用的身份证、印有本人代码的卡片和其它证件等。
