Leaders of the Frontline States hold summit

	NAMIBIA'S independence process is about to begin. The leaders of the Frontline States held a summit in Gaborone today to discuss the steps towards achieving this goal.

	According to a communiqué issued after the meeting, Chairman of the Frontline States and Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda demanded that the South African authorities allow the Namibian people to gain independence under free and fair conditions.

	Kaunda stated that this is a test for the South African authorities, and before South Africa passes this test, there is no question of any meetings with them.

	The communiqué said the Frontline States condemned the South African security forces' actions against the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in Namibia.

	The communiqué said the Frontline States urged the United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar to take measures to end these actions and ensure that SWAPO can freely participate in the elections for independence throughout Namibia.

	The communiqué also stated that the Frontline States leaders condemned the South African forces allowing non-Namibians to register as voters, attempting to alter the advantage SWAPO is expected to have in the November elections.

	The leaders of Tanzania, Mozambique, Botswana, and Zimbabwe, as well as a representative of the Angolan President, attended the meeting. Leaders of the South West Africa People's Organization, the African National Congress of South Africa, and the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania were also present.

　　纳米比亚独立进程即将开始
    非洲前线国家举行首脑会议
    新华社哈博罗内３月８日电  非洲前线国家领导人今天在这里举行会议，讨论实现纳米比亚独立的进程。
    据会后发表的公报说，前线国家主席、赞比亚总统卡翁达在讲话中要求南非当局允许纳米比亚人在自由和公正的条件下获得独立。
    卡翁达说，这对南非当局是一个考验，在南非通过这一考验之前，不存在与南非进行任何会晤的问题。
    公报说，前线国家谴责在纳米比亚的南非安全部队所推行的反对西南非洲人民组织的运动。
    公报说，前线国家要求联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔采取措施结束这一运动，以确保西南非洲人民组织能在纳米比亚各地自由地参加为实现独立所进行的选举。
    公报还说，前线国家领导人谴责南非部队让非纳米比亚人进行选民登记，企图以此改变在１１月份举行选举时西南非洲人民组织必将取得的优势。
    坦桑尼亚、莫桑比克、博茨瓦纳和津巴布韦的国家领导人以及安哥拉总统的代表出席了会议。西南非洲人民组织、南非非洲人国民大会和阿扎尼亚泛非主义者大会的领导人列席了会议。
