Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, March 6th. Reporter Li Jie reports: Henan Provincial Governor Cheng Weigao recently reported to the provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, saying: "Of the 20 major tasks that the provincial government decided to focus on at the beginning of last year, by the end of the year, 10 had been completed or exceeded, 6 had been basically completed, and 4 had not been completed."

Following this, several deputy governors took the stage in succession to report on which tasks they were responsible for had been completed, which had not been completed, and the reasons for those not completed.

A member of the People's Congress Standing Committee commented with deep feeling: "In the past, once a task was assigned, no one would check whether it was implemented or what the results were. Now, a strict responsibility system has been established, with clear divisions of labor and responsibilities. Each official has an account of what they have done each year and how well they have done it. This way of doing things not only increases the transparency of government work, making it easier for the people to supervise, but also strengthens the sense of responsibility of officials at all levels."

Cheng Weigao told the reporter, "Implementing the target management responsibility system is an important reform to achieve scientific management of government work. Although it is only in the initial stages and needs further summarization and improvement, the direction is correct, and we will continue with it."

　　省长登台述职　政府工作公开
    河南省府目标管理件件有交代
    本报郑州３月６日电  记者李杰报道：河南省省长程维高日前向省人大常委会汇报说：“去年初省政府决定要抓好的２０项重要任务中，到年底，有１０项已完成或超额完成，有６项已基本完成，还有４项没有完成。”
    接着，几位副省长相继登台，汇报了自己分管的工作哪些完成了，哪些没完成以及没完成的原因。
    一位人大常委对此深有感触：“过去，一项工作布置下去，落实了没有，结果好坏，谁也不管。现在，建立了严格的责任制，分工明确，责任清楚，一个干部每年干了些什么，干得如何，全都有个交代。这样做，既提高了政府工作的透明度，便于人民监督，也增强了各级政府的责任心。”
    程维高向记者说，实现目标管理责任制是实现政府工作科学管理的一项重要改革，虽然日前仅仅是起步，还有待进一步总结和完善，但方向是正确的，我们将坚持下去。
