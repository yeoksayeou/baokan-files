The Ministry of Agriculture has issued a warning that crop pests and diseases are likely to be severe this year. Various regions should be vigilant against fake and substandard pesticides.

The Ministry of Agriculture's plant protection experts recently told reporters that last winter was unusually warm, leading to a high density of overwintering pests. This year, crop diseases, pests, weeds, and rodent damage are expected to be severe. Key pests to watch for include wheat blast, wheat aphids, rice sheath blight, rice leafhoppers, rice stem borers, cotton aphids, and cotton bollworms. The affected area is estimated to reach over 500 million mu (approximately 33.3 million hectares). Local authorities should start preparing for prevention and control measures as soon as possible.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the increased occurrence of pests and diseases has exacerbated the supply-demand gap for pesticides. The Ministry of Agriculture has reminded various regions to seriously address pesticide production and supply while being vigilant against the resurgence of fake and substandard pesticides. Although this year's planned pesticide production and import quotas have increased compared to last year, the shortfall of over 10,000 tons from last year and the low end-of-year inventory have left the shortage problem severe.

The Ministry of Agriculture's Pesticide Inspection Institute has warned that in 1988, when crop pests and diseases were at a moderate level, fake and substandard pesticides were already rampant. This year, with the supply-demand contradiction intensifying, some individuals may take advantage of the situation to produce and sell fake and substandard pesticides. Local authorities should take early measures to prevent being deceived by fake and substandard pesticides.

　　农业部发出警报
    庄稼病虫害将偏重发生
    各地谨防假劣农药坑人
    本报北京３月８日讯  记者陈满正报道：农业部植保专家日前对记者说，去冬偏暖，越冬虫口密度大，今年农作物病虫草鼠害将偏重发生，其中小麦赤霉病、小麦吸浆虫、麦蚜、水稻纹枯病、稻飞虱、稻纵卷叶螟、棉蚜、棉花红铃虫都将发生较重。预计受害面积达５亿多亩，各地应及早做好防治准备工作。
    据新华社北京３月８日电　（记者蒲立业、实习生曾继双）病虫害偏重发生加大了农药供需缺口。农业部为此提醒各地，在认真做好农药产供工作的同时，要警惕制售假劣农药死灰复燃。据了解，虽然今年农药计划产量和进口用汇都比去年增加，但由于去年欠产１万多吨，商业部年末库存跌入低谷，紧缺问题仍然严重。
    农业部农药检定所提醒说：１９８８年为农作物病虫害中等发生年，假劣农药就已泛滥成灾。今年供需矛盾加剧，一部分人可能乘机制售假劣农药，各地应及早采取措施，谨防假劣农药坑人。
