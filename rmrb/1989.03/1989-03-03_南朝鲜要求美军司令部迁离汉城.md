	Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 2

	Seoul - With the escalation of anti-American sentiment in South Korea, the South Korean government has demanded the relocation of US military bases from Seoul.

	On February 28, the commander of US forces in South Korea, General Menniti, stated that the US government has agreed in principle to move the US military command and headquarters currently located in Yongsan, Seoul, to another location. The condition is that all relocation costs must be borne by the South Korean side, and the new site must meet American building standards and safety requirements, ensuring complete communication facilities. Only when these conditions are met can the US military command be relocated out of Seoul.
