The nine-day-long seventh session of the second CPPCC is coming to an end. During discussions, at the dining table, and in conversations, the delegates have been buzzing with opinions. Overall, they are satisfied with this session, but there are also some minor regrets.

▲ Wu Xiuping (CPPCC member, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League): From the plenary and small group meetings of the CPPCC, most delegates have a comprehensive view of the current situation. The most commendable aspect of Premier Li Peng's report is his courage to take responsibility for mistakes. Delegates have expressed many opinions, but they are not mere complaints; most of the opinions are constructive. However, the time was too short, and everyone felt they didn't get to fully express their thoughts.

▲ Ma Jiqing (CPPCC member, Vice Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association): Last year's session discussed some hot social issues, and people's emotions were more excited. This year's session, although not as lively on the surface, has seen delegates more calmly analyze the root causes of social hotspots like educational mistakes and economic overheating, which is a step forward from last year. The CPPCC work report was only discussed for half a day, which seems a bit short.

▲ Guan Mengjue (CPPCC member, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League): I have three observations. First, this year's small group discussions and plenary speeches were more calm and practical. Second, this session had fewer empty democratic talks and more practical democracy, making one feel that democracy is progressing steadily. Third, in the past, the China Democratic League's speeches at the plenary were either individual or joint names, but this year, it was in the name of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, reflecting the progress of the democratic parties' collective consciousness. The government leaders' speeches on the democratization and scientification of decision-making are worth noting, but the theoretical guidance for decision-making was not sufficiently discussed, and the analysis of theoretical mistakes in decision-making was insufficient.

▲ Wang Xiaotao (CPPCC member, Researcher at the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine): The plenary session allowed for open and frank discussions, which were both lively and pragmatic. The suggestions made were quite practical. There is only one opportunity to speak each year, and due to the limited time, each person's speech was restricted to ten minutes, but many issues cannot be fully explained in such a short time.

　　满意与遗憾        
    ——记在政协会结束之际
    本报记者  孟晓云
    为时９天的政协七届二次会议即将结束，讨论会上，饭桌前，交谈中，委员们议论丛生，对这次会总的来说是满意的，也有小小的遗憾。
    ▲吴修平（政协委员、民盟中央秘书长）：从政协召开的大会小会来看，大多数委员对当前的形势能够顾全大局，李鹏总理的报告最令人赞赏的一点是有勇气承担失误的责任。委员们发表意见不少，但不是牢骚，意见中建设性的较多。时间仓促，大家感到没有把话讲透。
    ▲马吉庆（政协委员、辽宁农工民主党副主委）：去年的会讨论了一些社会上的热点问题，人们的心情兴奋有余，今年的会从表面上看不那么热闹，但是，大家更为冷静地分析了教育失误、经济过热等社会热点问题的根源，比去年进了一步。政协工作报告只讨论了半天，时间似乎短了一些。
    ▲关梦觉（政协委员、民盟中央副主席）：我谈三点感受，一是今年无论小组讨论还是大会发言都比较冷静，比较实际；二是这次会议讲空头民主的少，讲实际民主的多，让人感到民主在扎扎实实前进；三是以往民盟在大会发言都是个人或联名，今年是以民盟中央的名义登上政协的讲坛，这反映民主党派的群体意识前进了一步。政府领导关于决策民主化科学化的发言值得重视，但对决策的理论指导讲得不够，对决策的理论失误分析不够。
    ▲王孝涛（政协委员、中国中医研究院研究员）：大会能畅所欲言，既活跃又实事求是，提的建议都比较切合实际。一年才有一次发言机会，由于时间仓促，每人发言限制在十分钟之内，而许多事情并非在短时间内能讲清楚的。
