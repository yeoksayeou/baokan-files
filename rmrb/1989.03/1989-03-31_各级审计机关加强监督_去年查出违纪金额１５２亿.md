In the past year, various levels of audit agencies in China have strengthened audit supervision. A total of 192,000 units were audited, an 18% increase from the previous year. Violations of financial discipline amounting to 15.2 billion yuan were uncovered, of which 3 billion yuan should be turned over to the treasury, and 2 billion yuan have already been deposited.

It is understood that last year, the audit agencies focused on auditing self-raised funds for construction projects and the construction of buildings and facilities. In the audit of 27,000 self-raised construction projects, more than 5,500 problematic projects were discovered. Through auditing, 840 million yuan in investments were reduced, and 180 million yuan in various special funds that had been misappropriated were returned. After the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the audit agencies also conducted follow-up audits on projects that the government had decided to suspend or slow down, achieving significant results.

Last year, the audit agencies implemented a regular audit system for the financial revenues and expenditures of 148,000 administrative and public institutions nationwide (including internal audit institutions). This prompted the audited units to strengthen financial management and reduce administrative expenditure.

　　各级审计机关加强监督        
    去年查出违纪金额１５２亿
    本报北京３月３０日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：在过去的一年中，我国各级审计机关加强审计监督，共审计了１９．２万多个单位，比上年增加１８％，查出违反财经纪律的金额１５２亿元，其中应上交财政３０亿元，已入库２０亿元。
    据了解，去年审计机关重点对自筹基建资金和楼堂馆所项目进行了审计，在对２．７万个自筹基建项目的审计中，发现有问题的项目５５００多个，通过审计，压缩投资８．４亿元，归还被挪用的各种专项资金１．８亿元。在十三届三中全会后，审计机关还对政府已决定的停缓建项目开展跟踪审计，取得很大成绩。
    去年，审计机关对全国１４．８万多个（含内审机构审计）行政事业单位财务收支实行了定期审计制度，促使被审计单位加强财务管理，压缩了行政经费开支。
