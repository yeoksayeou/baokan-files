The strike by ground staff at Eastern Air Lines entered its third day today. Due to the majority of pilots refusing to cross the picket line, the company announced the indefinite cancellation of most of its routes and the dismissal of six thousand employees.

Eastern Air Lines attempted to maintain its Washington-New York-Boston shuttle flights and routes to South America today. However, due to a sudden snowstorm in the Washington and New York areas, about two-thirds of the shuttle flights were forced to stop.

Despite Eastern Air Lines facing the threat of bankruptcy, the management has not yielded to the demand from the mechanics' union for a $120 million increase in wages and benefits. The company also requested the federal district court in Miami to issue an order forcing the pilots to return to work.

Meanwhile, it was reported that the courts in New York's Manhattan and Philadelphia have issued orders prohibiting railway workers in the two cities from supporting the strike by Eastern Air Lines' ground staff. The strikers failed to achieve their goal of disrupting railway operations in major metropolitan areas.

　　罢工历时三天　双方妥协无望
    美东航解雇六千职工     
    大部分航线无限期取消
    本报华盛顿三月六日电  记者仓立德报道：美国东方航空公司地勤人员举行的罢工今天进入第三天。由于大多数飞行员拒绝越过罢工纠察线登机，该公司宣布无限期取消大部分航线的飞行，同时解雇六千名职工。
    东方航空公司今天试图保持其华盛顿—纽约—波士顿的区间航班和飞经南美洲的航班。由于华盛顿、纽约地区突降暴风雪，约三分之二的区间航班被迫停飞。
    尽管东方航空公司现在面临破产威胁，资方对机械师工会增加一点二亿美元工资、福利待遇的要求仍未妥协。公司还要求迈阿密联邦地区法院发布命令，迫使飞行员返回工作岗位。
    另据报道，纽约曼哈顿及费城法院已发出命令，禁止两地铁路员工支持东方航空公司地勤人员的罢工活动。该公司罢工者未能实现阻碍大都市地区铁路运行的目的。
