Recently, I went to Shangqiu, Henan, on a friend's request, carrying four down comforters. After getting off the bus at the Shangqiu Bus Station, I was immediately surrounded by six or seven pedicab drivers. They eagerly threw my comforters onto one of the pedicabs. Then, they demanded 40 yuan for "loading fees." Under their threats, I had no choice but to hand over 40 yuan.

Two of the pedicab drivers asked me, "Do you want your goods delivered?" I said, "How much to get to the Shangqiu Railway Station?" They replied, "20 yuan per comforter." I was shocked. The distance from the bus station to the railway station is only about 250 meters, yet they demanded 80 yuan for the delivery. Those two men said that they had already taken my comforters and if I didn't let them deliver, they would not be kind to me. I had no choice but to pay another 80 yuan.

Upon arriving at the Shangqiu Railway Station, the two pedicab drivers told me to unload the goods. I asked them to help me take the comforters to the luggage check-in room, which was only 10 meters away from the station entrance. They smiled and said, "Our job is only to push the pedicab here. Someone else will handle the next step." With that, they unloaded my comforters and left.

Soon, a few more people came over. One tall man wearing a military coat said, "This is not a place to leave goods; violators will be fined." I immediately started to move the comforters. "Why not leave some work for us? We do this for a living!" the tall man said. As soon as he finished speaking, several people started to lift the comforters to the luggage check-in room and demanded money, "10 yuan per comforter for delivery." I had no choice but to pay another 40 yuan.

Four comforters weighing no more than 50 kilograms were extorted 160 yuan in less than 300 meters.

　　我在商丘被敲诈
    前不久，我去河南商丘市，受朋友之托，随行带有４床羽绒被。我在商丘汽车站下车后，就被六七个推三轮的拦住了，他们争先恐后地把我的羽绒被扔到一辆三轮车上。接着，他们便向我要４０元“装车费”。在他们的恐吓下，我不得不拿出４０元。
    两个推三轮车的人问我：“你的货要送吗？”我说：“到商丘火车站要多少钱？”他们说，“每床被子２０元”。我大吃一惊，汽车站到火车站距离不过２５０米，他们竟要收取８０元运费。那两人还说，这４床被子他们运定了，如果不让运，他们就对我不客气。我只好又出了８０元运费。
    来到商丘火车站前，那两个推三轮车的人要我卸货，我请他们帮我把货拉到距站前仅１０米远的车站行李托运房，那两人笑笑说：“我们推车的任务只到这里，下一步还有人办。”说罢，他们把我的羽绒被从车上卸下，推着三轮车走了。
    一会儿，又来了几个人。其中一个穿军大衣的高个子说：“这儿不是放货的地方，违者罚款。”我马上动手去搬被子。“怎么不给哥们儿留碗饭吃？我们几个就是干这个的！”那个高个子话音刚落，几个人便七手八脚地把羽绒被抬到行李托运房门口就伸手要钱，“每床被子１０元运费。”我只得又掏出４０元。
    ４床羽绒被重不过５０公斤，在不足３００米的路途中，我就被敲诈了１６０元。
