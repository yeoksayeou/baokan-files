Economic Growth Continues, Systemic Reforms Deepen
Cultural and Educational Undertakings Develop, Democracy and Legal System Strengthen

New China News Agency, Beijing, March 20th - Premier Li Peng today, in his government work report to the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, pointed out that 1988 was a year in which China's socialist modernization continued to advance.

Li Peng then elaborated on four aspects:

	— The national economy continued to grow. Last year, the gross national product reached 138.53 billion yuan, and the national income reached 115.33 billion yuan. Calculated at comparable prices, these figures increased by 11.2% and 11.4% respectively compared to the previous year. Despite frequent and severe natural disasters nationwide, grain and cotton production decreased, but many other agricultural products and diversified operations further developed, resulting in a 3.2% increase in the total agricultural output value. The national grain procurement task has been basically completed. Industrial production, transportation, and postal services continued to develop. The production of steel, coal, electricity, and petroleum increased significantly, and the growth of daily industrial products and agricultural industrial products in short supply was even faster. The labor productivity of industrial enterprises increased by 9.3% compared to the previous year. The living standards of the majority of urban and rural residents continued to improve.

	— Key construction projects achieved new successes. Nationwide, 78 large and medium-sized construction projects were completed and put into operation, including 178 individual projects within large and medium-sized projects. A number of key power stations, coal mines, railways, and ports were completed and put into operation, adding momentum to modernization construction.

	— Economic systemic reforms continued to deepen. The contract responsibility system for enterprise management gradually improved, and enterprise vitality further increased. Many enterprises, through optimizing labor combinations, improved labor productivity. In terms of macro-control, reforms were gradually carried out in planning, investment, materials, finance, foreign trade, and other aspects, initially strengthening the management of finance, taxation, banking, prices, auditing, customs, industrial and commercial administration, and other aspects.

	— Opening up to the outside world further expanded. The total import and export volume exceeded 100 billion US dollars, an increase of 24.4% compared to the previous year, and the proportion of industrial manufactured goods in exports increased. Actual utilization of foreign capital was 9.84 billion US dollars, an increase of 16.4% compared to the previous year. A total of 5,896 foreign-invested enterprises were approved, the highest number in a decade. International tourism earned 2.22 billion US dollars, a significant increase compared to the previous year.

Li Peng also mentioned that based on economic development, achievements have been made in science, education, culture, health, and sports. The construction of socialist democracy and socialist legal system has been strengthened. The reorganization of the State Council's institutions has been basically completed according to the plan approved by the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress. Public security, security, judicial, and other departments have done a lot of work to maintain social order. The people's army has played a tremendous role and made outstanding contributions in defending the motherland, supporting socialist modernization construction, and disaster relief.
