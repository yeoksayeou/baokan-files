In ancient times, the arts of calligraphy, chess, painting, and music, and the skills of medicine, divination, and astrology, were probably classified based on whether they had direct practical use. Chess, however, was different within the arts; it required two people to play, and one had to know how. One could appreciate calligraphy, paintings, and music without creating them, much like reciting poetry. But enjoying chess books and chess records, treating a game of chess like a painting, a musical piece, or even a poem or a short story, such people are rare. Fortunately or unfortunately, I have this habit. To this day, I still believe that the article and insights in the preface of the "Peach Blossom Spring Chess Records" by the Qing Dynasty go master Fan Xiping (Shi Jun) are as brilliant as the chess records themselves. As for the stories of chess and chess players, even those who do not understand chess can appreciate them.

The history of Chinese chess is long, with many anecdotes, but it seems not as dramatic as Japanese chess history. I do not know why. Someone has already written a "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" style Japanese chess history. As for explaining chess games to tell the turbulent history of Japanese chess, I have only seen one book, "A History of Famous Chess Matches and Masters in Japan" by An Yongyi. The book is good, but the Chinese translation is unsatisfactory in printing. The title is also a bit inferior to the original "Stories of Famous Chess Victories and Defeats."

An Yongyi was born in 1902 and was not a professional chess player but commented on chess. In 1933 (Showa 8), when Hideo Ota and Go Seigen established a new layout and opened a new era, he explained their theories for them. His "History of Famous Chess Matches and Masters in Japan" selects and explains 15 famous chess games from 1682 to 1933, with a brief history attached at the end, published in the 1970s. It is a unique approach to use chess to tell history.

Japanese modern chess history is indeed full of twists and turns, and from chess, one can also see the Japanese society and people before and after the Meiji era. Now, I will only talk about a well-known story in the chess world. Inoue Inshu, who styled himself as Gen'an, spent his life fighting for the "Chess Master" position but ultimately failed. He then took his disciples on a ship to sea, intending to come to China to showcase his talents, but unfortunately, he did not succeed. Sanada Shuyaku was an unfortunate genius chess master who died at the age of 34. These two people, one belonging to the Inoue family and the other to the Hon'inbo family, were rivals. In 1846, Shuyaku visited Gen'an to play a game. At that time, Shuyaku was 18 years old, and Gen'an was 48 years old. After the opening, Gen'an was obviously in a better position. In the middle of the game, the spectators commented that the young man was at a disadvantage. However, a doctor said, "I do not understand chess, but I understand medicine. I see that the person in trouble is not the young man but Gen'an. Because after the young man placed a stone in the center, Gen'an's ears suddenly turned red. This is a sign of surprise and anxiety." Indeed, the young Shuyaku defeated the old Gen'an. This is the famous "The Art of Blushing Ears." This single move itself seems to have no value in occupying territory, but from the overall perspective, its value is immeasurable. It is a brilliant move that connects one's own upper and lower positions and controls the enemy on both sides, making the opponent lose the initiative and unable to respond.

Ears turning red is a physiological phenomenon. The doctor deduced psychological changes from physiological symptoms and then deduced the source of external stimuli from psychological changes, finally making a deduction of losing the chess game from the unrelated red ears. Recently, the world has seen the rise of semiotics or semiology, which is gradually spreading. "The Art of Blushing Ears" can be considered an example of the semiotics method.

"The human is a tool-making animal." This sentence has spread. "The human is a symbol-making animal." This sentence is also spreading. If tools and symbols are both broadly interpreted as means, then the two can be said to be the same thing. Tools, not just language, also have symbolic properties. Symbols (generally, without analysis) have the characteristic of pointing to something beyond themselves. Tools similarly point to something beyond themselves. Both do not stand alone in meaning. For example, an axe, when used for chopping wood, shows its meaning as a tool; in the hand of Li Kui, it is a weapon, that is, a tool for killing. Symbols can have multiple meanings, for example, language symbols, sounds can be lyrics, and characters can be calligraphy. But no matter how you say it, symbols must go from one thing to another, from the surface to the inside, from the external to the internal, from the form to the meaning (sometimes the meaning is within the form). The premise of doing this is to acknowledge symbols, to acknowledge that we both create symbols and live in a symbolic world. We constantly receive and send symbols and the information they convey every day. Looking at the world this way, is it madness or wisdom? I do not dare to say.

War, diplomacy, detective work, romance, dialogue, learning... Since humans had totems, they have lived by the principle of symbols. But the recognition of symbols did not develop until the 20th century, especially the second half. Semiotics or symbol research derived from linguistics is not limited to mathematics and logic; semiotics is also used in law, economics, and politics. Its use in literature and art is even more obvious. "Pointing at the finger to see the moon," is the Zen riddle not also a symbol?

Since the Chinese began carving characters on oracle bones and drawing the Eight Trigrams, we have been accustomed to creating symbols and viewing everything with a symbolic perspective. For example, a person's identity, like a trademark, indicates value and status. Is it that we also treat people as symbols or tools, making our view of people different from that of Europeans and Americans? On this point, I dare not speak casually.

　　耳赤之一手
    金克木
    古时琴棋书画算艺术，医卜星相算方技，大概是以有无直接实用意义划分的。棋在艺术中又不一样，必须有两人对弈而且自己要会。不写，不作，不演奏，可以欣赏字画和音乐，仿佛吟诗。但不下棋而好看棋书、棋谱，把一局棋当作字画、乐曲甚至一首诗、一篇小说来欣赏，这样的人怕不多了。幸或是不幸，我就有这个毛病。我至今还认为清代围棋天才范西屏（世勋）的《桃花泉弈谱·自序》的文章及见解和棋谱同样高超。至于棋和棋手的故事自然是不懂棋也会欣赏的。
    中国围棋历史很长，轶事很多，但似乎不如日本围棋史那么像讲史小说，不知为什么。已经有人写出演义式的日本围棋史话了。以讲解棋局的方式讲日本的风云多变的围棋史的，我只见到安永一的《日本围棋历代名手名局史话》。书很好，可惜汉译本印刷不能令人满意。书名也有点赶不上原名《围棋名胜负物语》简洁。
    安永一生于１９０２年，不是职业棋士，却评论围棋。１９３３年（昭和８年），木谷实和吴清源创立新布局开辟新时代之时，他为他们讲出理论。他这本《史话》选讲了１６８２年到１９３３年的著名棋局１５局，另附简略通史于后，是７０年代的著作。以棋讲史，别辟蹊径。
    日本近代棋史确是波谲云诡，由此也可从围棋看出明治前后的日本社会和日本人。现在只说围棋界大约都知道的一段故事。井上因硕自号幻庵，为争“棋所”官职花费一生心力，最后仍归失败，便带了徒弟搭船出海，想到中国来一展抱负，可惜未能如愿。桑田秀策是不幸３４岁早夭的天才棋圣。这两人，一个属井上家，一个属本因坊家，两家互相对立。１８４６年秀策访幻庵对弈。那时秀策１８岁，幻庵４８岁。开局后，幻庵显然占了上风。下到中盘，观棋的人评论，都以为少年已处于劣势。有一位医生却说：“我不懂下棋，只懂医道。我看处于困境的不是那少年而是幻庵。因为那少年在中央下一子后，幻庵的耳朵忽然通红了。这是吃惊和着急的症象。”果然少年秀策胜了老将幻庵。这就是有名的“耳赤之一手”。这一着孤棋本身似乎毫无占地盘的价值，但从全局看来则其价值之大无法估量，是使自己上下通连又左右制敌，使对手失去主动而无法应付的绝妙一着。流传至今，妙手之名不减。
    耳朵变红是生理现象。医生由生理症候推出心理变化，又由心理变化推出外界刺激来源，终于从毫不相干的耳朵变红作出下棋失利的推断，近来世界上兴起符号研究或符号学，正在逐步扩散。“耳赤之一手”可算符号研究方式之一例。
    “人是制造工具的动物。”这句话已经传开。“人是制造符号的动物。”这句话也在蔓延。如果把工具和符号都作广义解说，都是手段，则两者又可说是一回事。工具，不仅是语言，也具有符号性质。符号（笼统的，不加分析）的特点就是指向本身以外。工具同样指向本身以外。两者都不以本身意义独立。例如斧头，在伐木劈柴时显示意义为工具；在李逵手中是武器，亦即杀人的工具。符号可有多重意义，例如语言符号，语音可以是歌词，文字可以是书法。但不管怎么说，符号都要由此及彼，由表及里，由外延到内涵，由形式达意义（有时意义即在形式之中）。这样做的前提是承认符号，承认我们既制造符号又生活在符号世界里。我们每天不断收发符号和所传的信息。这样来看世界是发疯还是变聪明了呢？我不敢断定。
    战争、外交、侦探、言情、对话、学习……人类自从有图腾以来就应用符号原理生活了。但对符号的认识直到２０世纪，特别是后半世纪才大发展。从语言学引出的符号学或符号研究当然不限于数学和逻辑，符号学也用在法律、经济、政治上。用于文学艺术更不必说。“因指见月”，禅机不也是符号吗？
    我们中国人自从在甲骨上刻字和画八卦以来，就习惯于制造符号并用符号眼光看一切。例如人的身份，如同商标，标明价值和等级。是不是会连人也当作符号或工具以致和欧美人对人的看法大不相同呢？这一点，我可就不能随口乱说了。
