Textile system representatives appeal: accelerate the development of chemical fiber raw materials and address dangerous housing

    The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Mo Xinyuan reports: On the morning of March 24, 75 National People's Congress representatives from the textile system gathered at the Ministry of Textile Industry at the invitation of Minister Wu Wenying.

    Due to raw material shortages and price increases, the textile industry experienced widespread losses in production during January and February this year, and the representatives were deeply concerned. Shanghai representative Mei Shouchun seemed dissatisfied with just discussing the issues and pulled out two draft proposals he had already written, saying, "Since everyone is here today, I have prepared two proposals. Those who agree, please sign." In this way, the proposals "Urgent Need to Accelerate the Development of Chemical Fiber Raw Materials" and "Urgent Need to Address Dangerous Factory Buildings in the Textile System" quickly exceeded the statutory number of proposers. Minister Wu Wenying thanked the representatives for their concern and support for the textile industry.

　　纺织系统代表呼吁：加快发展化纤原料和解决危房
    本报讯  记者莫新元报道：３月２４日上午，全国纺织系统的７５名人大代表应部长吴文英之邀，会聚纺织部。
    由于原料紧缺、涨价，今年一二月份纺织行业的生产出现大面积亏损，代表们忧心忡忡。上海代表梅寿椿似乎不满足于坐而论道，掏出两份已写好的提案草本说：“就着今天人齐，我准备了两份提案，同意的，请签名。”就这样，“加快化纤原料发展刻不容缓”、“纺织系统危险厂房亟待解决”两条提案很快超出了法定的提案人数。吴文英部长感谢代表们对纺织行业的关心和支持。
