Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 20th.

Premier Li Peng said at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress that to ensure that this year's price increase is significantly lower than last year, the state will strengthen price and market management and strictly enforce fiscal discipline.

Li Peng said in the government work report that the most prominent problems and difficulties we face are the emergence of obvious inflation, excessive price increases, and the national retail price index rising by 18.5% compared to 1987. Such a large price increase exceeds the tolerance of the masses, enterprises, and the state, and the actual living standards of a considerable number of urban residents have declined. These situations have attracted widespread social attention and caused serious public concern.

Li Peng emphasized specific measures to strengthen price and market management and strictly enforce fiscal discipline. He said that prices and fees for production materials and daily necessities managed by the State Council, as well as various charges, must not be arbitrarily raised or increased by any department, locality, or enterprise. Prices and fees managed by local governments at various levels must be strictly controlled in accordance with the regulations of the State Council. The maximum prices for important agricultural and sideline products, industrial consumer goods, and certain non-planned production materials as stipulated by the State Council must be strictly enforced. Large and medium-sized cities should compile a list of major sideline food products and other essential commodities for the people, and adopt comprehensive measures such as supporting production and financial subsidies to ensure the market supply of these commodities and maintain basic price stability. Governments at all levels should strengthen the guidance and supervision of price liberalization. For relatively important commodities, the enterprise price increase reporting system must be strictly implemented, reasonable regional, purchase-sale, and wholesale-retail price differentials must be regulated, circulation links must be reduced, and the behavior of transferring burdens through price increases in different places must be stopped. The cultivation of various commodity and material trading markets should be continued, market trading rules should be strictly enforced, and trading activities should be made public and voucher-based. The role of state-owned material and commercial enterprises in absorbing, adjusting, stabilizing the market, and curbing prices should be fully valued, and tax collection and management work for various enterprises and individual industrial and commercial households should be strengthened.

Li Peng also emphasized the need to seriously rectify and improve the circulation methods of important commodities. For scarce agricultural and sideline products, both regional blockades and price hikes and purchases should be prevented, and regional interests should be reasonably resolved through economic means.

　　李鹏指出物价上涨超越群众企业国家承受能力        
    确保物价上涨明显低于去年        
    国家将要加强管理严格纪律
    新华社北京３月２０日电  国务院总理李鹏在七届人大二次会议上说，为了确保今年的物价上涨幅度明显低于去年，国家将切实加强物价和市场管理，严格财政纪律。
    李鹏在政府工作报告中说，我们面临的问题和困难最突出的是出现了明显的通货膨胀，物价上涨幅度过大，全国零售物价总指数比１９８７年上升１８．５％。物价上涨幅度这么大，超越了群众、企业和国家的承受能力，相当一部分城市居民的实际生活水平有所下降。这些情况引起了社会的普遍关注和群众的严重不安。
    李鹏在谈到加强物价和市场管理、严格财政纪律的具体措施时强调，国务院管理的生产资料、生活资料的价格和各项收费，任何部门、地方和企业都不得擅自提价和提高收费标准。各级地方政府管理的价格和收费，要按照国务院的规定，严格控制。对国务院规定的重要农副产品、工业消费品和某些计划外生产资料的最高限价，必须严格执行。大中城市要列出一些主要副食品和其他人民生活必需品的商品目录，采取扶持生产、财政补贴等综合性措施，保证这些商品的市场供应，保持价格的基本稳定。各级政府要加强对放开价格的指导和监督。对比较重要的商品，要认真执行企业提价申报制度，规定合理的地区、进销、批零价格差率，减少流通环节，制止中间盘剥，制止通过易地涨价来转嫁负担的行为。继续培育各类商品和物资的交易市场，严格市场交易规则，促使交易活动公开化、票据化。要充分重视和发挥国营物资企业、商业企业吞吐调剂、稳定市场、平抑物价的作用，加强对各类企业以及个体工商户的税收征管工作。
    李鹏还强调要认真整顿和改进重要商品的流通方式。对于紧缺的农副产品，既要防止地区之间相互封锁，又要防止地区之间抬价抢购，要尽量通过经济办法合理解决地区之间的利益分配关系。
