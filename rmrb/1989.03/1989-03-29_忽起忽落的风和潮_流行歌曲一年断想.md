When the "northwest wind" blew, songs like "Yellow Earth Plateau" and "Sky Songs" echoed throughout the country. Critics rejoiced, thinking we had finally broken free from the influence of Hong Kong and Taiwan pop music, believing that the soft and decadent trends were over, and that our music would dominate the scene. But before the applause could fade, the mournful and proud voice of Taiwan's Tsui Chin singing "Wolf" swept through the streets, even middle school students were eager to see "The World Outside." Soon after, prisoners became widely known, and prison misfortunes seemed strangely glamorous. Songs like "Prison Song" and "Tears of Regret" became extremely popular. But before the sad and bitter humming could fade, with the broadcast of TV dramas like "One Plum Blossom" and "Stars of Last Night," and a song by Su Rui, "Following the Feeling," Taiwanese music once again became the must-sing songs at almost all gatherings.

In the midst of these rising and falling trends, people can't help but feel confused: Are we still following Hong Kong and Taiwan? Can our creations dominate the music scene? Do we really prefer the "northwest wind" or something else? Why does the music scene always sway with every trend?

Is it because the songwriters' creations are too concentrated, with too little variety? People get tired of one style and naturally seek another; or perhaps in this style, some people's tastes are satisfied, while others with different moods, environments, and cultural backgrounds feel left out, eagerly awaiting works that match their inner feelings. If our music scene had a variety of styles coexisting, where everyone could find their own choices at different times and in different environments, the situation would be quite different.

Is it because the creation of popular songs still can't meet the demand? Otherwise, how could songs like "Prison Song," with old tunes and old content, suddenly become so popular? If new works don't come, the old ones will inevitably repeat, at most changing a bit to satisfy some people's psychology. If there were many excellent works circulating, people in various moods would have favorite songs to express their emotions, including sad and sorrowful tunes, and the voices of prisoners wouldn't be so popular.

Is it because our music criticism is too extreme? When discussing the "northwest wind," it seems only this wind can be trusted, and when praising rock music, non-rock music is ridiculed everywhere. Different styles and genres of works have their own inherent value and standards of judgment, and all should be acknowledged by criticism. For example, in Japan, Western popular music has always spread quickly and had a significant influence, but besides new music (learning from Western music), folk songs with national characteristics and traditional enka are still deeply loved by many people.

Is it because we have too much prejudice against Hong Kong and Taiwan songs? Now, some people can't bear to hear that Hong Kong and Taiwan songs are spreading, and this psychological barrier is related to the recent years of criticism against Hong Kong and Taiwan songs. Initially, mainland popular songs started by imitating Hong Kong and Taiwan, which was understandable because the mainland lacked such music. Now that excellent works are coming, there's no need to panic. All excellent works and performances, whether from Hong Kong and Taiwan or abroad, should be welcomed. This is art, and there's no need for narrow political views to interfere.

　　忽起忽落的风和潮         
    ——流行歌曲一年断想
    当“西北风”刮起时，《黄土高坡》、《信天游》响彻大江南北，评论家曾为之雀跃，以为我们终于从港台流行歌曲的风气中走了出来，以为柔弱、颓唐之风已成过去，以为我们的歌风终将主导歌坛……谁知，叫好声未落，哀怨孤傲的台湾齐秦一声“狼”吟席卷大街小巷，以至连中学生都争睹《外面的世界》。紧接着，身系缧绁的人大面积曝光，牢狱之灾竟异常光彩起来，《囚歌》、《悔恨的泪》等等磁带一时格外走俏。然而，这又愁又苦的哼哼声尚未远去，随着电视剧《一剪梅》、《昨夜星辰》的播放，加上一首苏芮的《跟着感觉走》，台湾的歌声又成为几乎所有歌会的必唱曲目。
    在这些风啊潮啊的起落中，人们不由恍惚起来：难道我们还要跟着港台走？我们的创作能否构成歌坛主导？我们到底是喜欢“西北风”还是别的什么？为什么歌坛总在一股风一股潮中荡漾？
    是不是词曲作家的创作太集中，色彩、品种太单调？人们在一种风格中耽搁太久，自然就急于它求，希望换一种风格品尝；或者在这种风格中，一部分人的情趣满足了，而另一批心绪不同、环境不同、文化素养不同的人却感到失落，因而热切企盼适合他们心底感受的作品问世。如果我们的歌坛是一种风格流派纷呈共存局面，各种人在各种时期、各种环境下，都有自己选择的天地，恐怕情形就大不相同了。
    是不是流行歌曲创作还是供不应求？否则，像《囚歌》这类旧曲调旧内容的歌曲何以竟会大放异彩？新的作品不来，旧的肯定会周而复始，至多不过翻翻花样，以满足一些人的心理。如果有大量佳作流行，人们在各种心态下都有喜爱的歌曲可抒发各种情绪，表现内心的种种感受，包括悲凉、忧伤的情调，犯人的歌喉也不致如此走红。
    是不是我们的音乐评论太爱走极端？议论“西北风”时，似乎唯有此风才堪当重任，颂扬摇滚时，又处处嘲弄非摇滚。各种风格和流派的作品，自有其固有价值和判断标准，都应该得到评论的承认。譬如日本，西方的流行音乐一向传播神速，影响较大，但除新音乐（学习西方的音乐）外，带有民族风格的歌谣体歌曲和传统的演歌仍深得许多人的心。
    是不是我们对港台歌曲的成见过深？现在有人一听说港台歌曲流传，在心理上就难以承受，这种心理障碍和近几年对港台歌曲的贬斥有关。当初，大陆流行歌曲是靠仿效港台起家的，这本无可厚非，因为大陆阙如。如今有精采之作传来，也不必恐慌，所有优秀的作品和表演，无论港台或国外的，都应欢迎。这是艺术，无需狭隘的政治观念去猜度。
    大风大潮已过，但愿今后不再被吹得头晕。
