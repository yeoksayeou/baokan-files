An Idea Worth 50 Million Yuan

The decision to proceed with the Baosteel water supply project underwent a thought-provoking transformation. During the construction of the first phase, relevant departments, following the usual practice, decided under leadership guidance to draw industrial water from Dianshan Lake, 72 kilometers away from Baosteel. After the plan was announced, the Shanghai scientific community was in an uproar. Some experts said, "Baosteel is built on the banks of the vast Yangtze River, but it chooses to draw water from an inland lake instead of the nearby river. What kind of decision is this?" They were unwilling to see this unscientific plan implemented. Nearly a hundred experts from the Shanghai Institute of Metallurgy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, East China University of Chemical Technology, and other units took the initiative to conduct a follow-up evaluation. They braved wind and rain to repeatedly test the water quality of the Yangtze River, analyzing and evaluating a large amount of scientific data, and proposed a new idea: to build a reservoir and use Yangtze River water. This scientifically validated suggestion required less labor, less investment, and had better benefits. It was adopted by relevant departments of the State Council and the Shanghai Municipal Government. The implementation results showed that the project saved over 50 million yuan in investment compared to the plan to draw water from Dianshan Lake, and it also saved 25 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. This opened the eyes of relevant government decision-makers. They realized that science is the basis for decision-making. Many decisions made in the past through "brainstorming" and "circling" were often wrong, not because of a lack of effort, but because they deviated from science. They sought advice from scientists and learned that with the development of modern science and social progress, decision-making itself has become a science. As Shanghai Municipal Science and Technology Commission Vice Chairman Wei Hu said, the results of soft science not only help leaders grasp feedback information, discover flaws and shortcomings in decisions, and correct mistakes, but more importantly, the strategic thinking it contains, once transformed into specific plans and policies, will bring huge benefits to the development of society, economy, and technology.

Investment and Output: 1 to 60

Two years ago, the State Science and Technology Commission launched a series of soft science research projects, including one on how to accelerate the development of China's microelectronics technology. The Shanghai Institute of Science and Technology and other units undertook this project. They organized 27 experts to conduct surveys in 17 provinces and cities, including Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Guangdong, and Sichuan, and proposed a "Forecast for the Development of China's Microelectronics Technology." From various proposals, they selected several suggestions: microelectronics technology should develop in regions and levels, adapt to the development of the national economy; economically, enterprises should be given appropriate benefits; start with consumer electronics products to "ignite" and promote the formation of a scale economy. These suggestions were adopted by the then Ministry of Electronics Industry and recommended to the State Council. The State Council made a policy based on this, to reduce the corporate income tax by 50% for a certain period and allocate 10% of the pre-tax profit as a development fund for microelectronics production enterprises. This effectively released the energy of enterprises to develop products. The implementation of these policies brought China's microelectronics industry into a new development period.

The deputy leader of this project group, Wang Xinhua, recently spoke about this matter, saying, "This decision-making research, from collecting materials, listening to experts' opinions to proposing decision-making suggestions, and finally to the national policy being issued, took only over a year, with expenses of only over 100,000 yuan. But the benefits triggered by the implementation of the policy are difficult to estimate."

There are many similar projects with small investments and large outputs. A group of science and technology experts completed a "Consultation on Selecting Key Technology Import Projects," which, by accurately grasping the pulse of Shanghai's economic development, selected 27 large-scale projects. After being adopted and implemented by the municipal government, most of them recovered their investments in a short period, significantly promoting economic development. Due to the drawbacks of the management system, some enterprises in Shanghai had low enthusiasm for earning foreign exchange. Last year, economic experts, through investigation and demonstration, participated in a major decision of the municipal government: to implement the "double-line" contract system for industry and commerce. Industrial enterprises shifted from fulfilling the task of exporting goods to directly contracting export tasks, while foreign trade companies changed from purchasing and selling to contracting export agency indicators, and both parties jointly shouldered the responsibility of earning foreign exchange. The municipal leadership decided to first promote this in the textile industry, which accounts for 40% of the total foreign exchange earnings. This domestically pioneering reform of the foreign trade management system, after being introduced, greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of both industry and commerce, especially the grassroots industrial enterprises, to export and earn foreign exchange. Recent information from several woolen and cotton textile mills shows that the variety of exportable products has generally increased, and the contract performance rate for foreign trade has reached 100%. Shanghai's relevant departments have calculated the input and output effects of soft science. From the more than 500 completed soft science projects, the average research cost for each is only 178,000 yuan, equivalent to 10% of foreign countries. According to a survey of 68 consulting and research institutions, on average, for every yuan invested in consulting and research, 63 yuan of calculable value is created. These soft science institutions have earned the titles of "think tank" and "idea bank" due to their outstanding achievements.

Involving the Hotspots of Social Development

The importance and superiority of soft science have aroused great enthusiasm among Shanghai's decision-makers. Statistics show that currently, the city has more than 150 high-level soft science research institutions such as systems engineering, systems analysis, operations research, testing research, and consulting centers, accounting for more than 1/3 of the national total; many policy research institutions of government agencies have also separated from administrative agencies. More than 3,400 experts from various disciplines have joined the ranks of soft science research. They actively participate in forecasting research, formulate strategic plans, relevant policies, and management measures. A multi-disciplinary, multi-level research network has formed in Shanghai. In the past two years, more than 1,000 large and medium-sized soft science research projects have been completed by research institutions across the city. Among them, 80% have been adopted by relevant departments of various levels of government, playing an increasingly significant role in government decision-making and strongly promoting the process of democratization and scientification of decision-making.

Analyzing these soft science research achievements, one can easily find that their research topics are shifting from micro to macro, from technological economy to comprehensive social development strategies, and the quality of research is continuously improving.

They are involved in the hotspots of social development—how Shanghai should formulate a population development strategy. Experts and scholars from medical, health, population, and sociology research departments have predicted Shanghai's population growth trend and proposed a series of suggestions and policy measures related to population planning, such as family planning and eugenics. After verification, these became government decisions and were implemented, effectively controlling Shanghai's population growth. Statistics show that this city with the largest population in the country has become the city with the lowest birth rate, natural growth rate, second-child rate, and multiple-child rate.

They closely follow the research on the economic and social development of the entire city. More than 1,600 experts from various disciplines have conducted investigations and research on various aspects of Shanghai's economy, science and technology, and society, using more than 70 quantitative analysis methods to process 10 million data points. Based on a thorough understanding of the current situation, they formulated Shanghai's short-term and long-term economic development plans. The completion of this soft science project's research results made Shanghai's decision-makers clear: Shanghai should move towards the goal of becoming a modernized city that is open, multifunctional, technologically advanced, and has a reasonable industrial structure. Based on this strategic goal, a series of supporting policies, plans, and measures have been formulated.

Calling for a Democratized Decision-Making Procedure

To make soft science truly penetrate the high-level decision-making layer of the government, it is first necessary for leaders to strengthen their democratic consciousness and update their decision-making concepts. Five years ago, scientists predicted that by 1990, 500,000 telephone lines would need to be built to meet the needs of Shanghai. However, the relevant departments did not adopt this suggestion, and due to insufficient funds, the number of telephone lines in the city has only increased to 200,000, completely failing to meet the needs of the new situation of reform and opening up, and citizens generally complain about the difficulty of making phone calls. There is another example: in 1986, relevant departments of Shanghai made an incorrect judgment, thinking that the enthusiasm for building residential houses had passed, and planned to reduce the construction area of residential houses in 1987. At this time, experts conducted a sample survey, showing that Shanghai residents' demand for solving the "housing difficulty" was still high. They appealed to the municipal leaders to continue increasing investment to build residential houses. At that time, Mayor Jiang Zemin submitted the experts' suggestions, which had been verified, to the mayor's office meeting for discussion, and the suggestion to continue building 1 million square meters of residential houses in 1987 was adopted. A leader, even a very wise leader, cannot avoid making one-sided or mistaken decisions due to limited knowledge and information. Therefore, leaders must strengthen their democratic and scientific consciousness in decision-making, changing from individual "autocracy" to collective "democracy."

Shanghai's soft science experts believe that the true realization of the democratization and scientification of decision-making also requires reforming the decision-making system and providing legal guarantees. Decision-making work is a complex system engineering, and various decisions have certain risks in the implementation process. Various soft science research results adopted as decisions may also encounter unexpected situations during implementation. Therefore, the state should consider formulating decision-making regulations to legally regulate the procedures of decision-making, the evaluation of decision-making implementation effects, the handling of unexpected situations in decision-making implementation, the rights and responsibilities of soft science research work, as well as the rewards for adopting and implementing research results, so that soft science research and decision-making work have laws to follow.

　　软科学的硬效应
    新华社记者  叶世涛  张学全
    　　　　一个主意５０００万元
    宝钢引水工程的上马，曾有过令人深思的变更过程。在一期工程建设中，有关部门按照惯例由领导决定，从距宝钢７２公里的淀山湖引进工业用水。方案公布后，上海科技界为之哗然。有的专家说：“宝钢建在滔滔长江边，却舍近求远去引内湖水，这是什么决策？”他们不甘心让这种不科学的方案付诸实施，中国科学院上海冶金所、华东化工学院等单位的近百名专家，主动开展了追踪评估。他们风里来，雨里去，对长江水质反复测试，从大量的科学数据中进行分析、评估，提出了一个新主张：筑库取用长江水。这一经过科学论证的建议，耗工少、投资少，效益好，被国务院有关部委和上海市政府采纳，实施结果证明，工程投资比从淀山湖引水方案节约５０００多万元，每年还可节电２５００万度。这使政府有关决策者大开眼界。他们认识到，科学是决策的基础。过去很多“拍脑袋”、“划圈圈”作出的决策之所以屡屡失误，并非用心不好，而是离开了科学。他们向科学家讨教，知道随着现代科学的发展，社会的进步，决策本身也已成为一门科学。正如上海市科委副主任魏瑚所说的，软科学的成果不仅能帮助领导者掌握反馈信息，发现决策的缺陷和不足，弥补失误，更重要的是，它包含的战略思想，一旦转化为具体的规划、政策，就会对社会、经济、科技的发展带来巨大的效益。
    　　　　投入与产出：１比６０
    两年前，国家科委推出了一系列软科学研究项目，其中有一项是我国微电子技术应当如何加速发展。上海市科学学研究所等单位承接了这项课题。他们组织２７名专家，先后分赴辽宁、黑龙江、广东、四川等１７个省、市进行调查，提出了“中国微电子技术发展前景预测”，从多种设想中又筛选出若干建议：微电子技术应当分区域、分层次发展，同国民经济发展相适应；经济上给企业适当让利；从消费类电子产品开始“引爆”，促进规模经济形成。这些建议被当时的电子工业部采纳并向国务院推荐，国务院据此作出了在一定时期对微电子生产企业减免５０％的所得税，提取１０％税前利润作为开发基金的政策，有效释放了企业开发产品的能量。这些政策的实施，使我国微电子工业步入新的发展时期。
    这个课题组的副组长王新华最近谈到此事时说：“这项决策研究从收集资料、听取名家意见到提出决策建议，直至最后国家政策出台，前后只用一年多时间，所花经费不过１０万多元，但政策贯彻后转化引发的效益却很难估算。”
    类似这样投入小产出大的课题还有不少。一批科技专家完成的“选择技术引进重点项目的咨询”，由于摸准了上海经济发展的脉搏，挑选的２７个大型项目被市政府采纳实施后，大多在短期内收回投资，有力地促进了经济发展。由于经营体制的弊端，上海一些企业创汇热情不高。去年，经济专家通过调查论证，参与了市政府的一项重大决策：推行工贸“双线”承包制。工厂企业从承担出口货源拨交任务转为直接承包出口任务，外贸公司从收购包销改为承包出口代理指标，彼此共挑创汇担子。市领导决定今年在占全市创汇总额４０％的纺织行业先行推广。这一国内首创的外贸经营体制改革出台后，大大调动了工贸双方尤其是基层工业企业出口创汇的积极性。几家毛纺、棉纺厂新近传来的信息显示，出口适销品种普遍增多，对外合同履约率达到１００％。上海有关部门核计过软科学投入和产出的效应。从已完成的５００多个软科学课题看，平均每个所花研究费仅１．７８万元，相当于国外的１０％。据对６８家咨询、研究机构抽查，平均每投入一元咨询研究费，创造了可计算的价值６３元。这些软科学机构由于它卓著的成绩，赢得了“智囊团”、“思想库”的美称。
    　　　　涉足社会发展热点
    软科学显示出的重要性和优越性，唤起了上海决策者们对软科学的极大热情。据统计，目前全市拥有系统工程、系统分析、运筹研究、检测研究、咨询中心等高层次软科学、研究机构１５０多家，占全国总数１／３以上；还有许多政府机关的政策研究机构从行政机构中分离出来。有３４００多名各学科专家参加到软科学研究的行列。他们积极参与预测研究，制定战略规划、有关政策、管理措施。一个多学科、多层次的研究网络已经在上海形成。近两年来，全市软科学研究机构已完成大中型软科学研究课题近千项。其中８０％已为各级政府的有关部门采纳，对政府决策所起的作用越来越大，有力地推动了决策民主化、科学化的进程。
    对这些软科学研究成果作番分析，人们不难发现，其研究课题正由微观转向宏观，从技术经济转向社会综合发展战略，研究的质量日趋提高。
    他们涉足社会发展的热点——上海应如何制定人口发展战略。来自医学、卫生、人口学、社会学等研究部门的专家、学者，对上海人口增长趋势进行预测，并提出了节制生育、优生优育等有关人口计划增长的一系列建议和政策措施，经过论证成为政府决策，付诸实施后，上海市的人口增长得到有效控制。统计表明，这个全国人口最多的城市已经成为人口出生率、自然增长率、二孩率和多孩率最低的城市。
    他们紧盯全市经济社会发展研究。全市１６００名各学科专家，对上海的经济、科技、社会等多方面情况进行调查研究，采用７０多种定量分析的方法，处理了１０００万个数据。在充分弄清现状的基础上，制订上海市经济发展的近期和远期规划，这项软课题研究成果的完成，使上海的决策者们明确：上海应该向开放型、多功能、技术先进、产业结构合理的现代化城市目标前进。根据这个战略目标，一系列配套政策、规划、措施都制定出来了。
    　　　　呼唤民主化决策程序
    要使软科学真正深入政府高级决策层，首先要求领导者增强民主意识，更新决策观念。５年前，科学家们对上海市内电话发展作出预测，认为到１９９０年必须兴建５０万门电话才能适应需要，但有关部门未能采纳这个建议，再加上财力不足，到目前市内电话只增到２０万门，完全不适应改革开放的新形势，市民普遍抱怨“打电话难”。还有一例，１９８６年，上海市有关部门判断失当，以为兴建居民住房热已过去，１９８７年可削减住房建设面积。此时专家们作了抽样调查，表明上海居民对解决“住房难”的呼声依旧很高。他们向市领导呼吁，继续增加投资兴建居民住房。当时的市长江泽民把专家经过论证的建议提交市长办公会议讨论，结果采纳了专家的这一建议，作出１９８７年继续兴建１００万平方米住宅的决策。一个领导者、即使是很高明的领导者也难以避免因掌握的知识和情况局限而产生片面或失误。因此，领导者要增强决策的民主意识和科学意识，由个人“独断”变为集思广益的“群断”。
    上海的软科学专家们认为，决策的民主化、科学化的真正实现，还必须改革决策体制和提供法律保障。决策工作是一项复杂的系统工程，各种决策在实施过程中，都有一定的风险性。各项软科学研究成果被采纳作为决策，在实施过程中也可能出现意外。因此国家应当考虑制订决策工作法规，对决策的程序，决策实施效果的评价，对决策实施意外的处理、软科学研究工作的权利、责任，以及研究成果采纳实施后的报偿等都要作出法律规定，使软科学研究和决策工作都有法可循。
