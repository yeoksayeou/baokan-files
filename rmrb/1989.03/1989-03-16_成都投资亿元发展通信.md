Chengdu Invests 100 Million Yuan to Develop Communications

	The recently designated sub-provincial city of Chengdu, Sichuan Province, will invest over 100 million yuan in its communications industry this year for the first time.

	It is understood that in the past two years, the Chengdu Post and Telecommunications Bureau has successively put into operation 22,000 digital telephone lines. However, the number of users waiting to be connected has increased by more than three times compared to two years ago. "Telephones are even more popular than color TVs!" This is how local residents describe the supply and demand contradiction.

	Zhang Yuqiang, the director of the Municipal Post and Telecommunications Bureau, introduced that this year is the year with the highest investment in communications development. The main focus of the investment is on five major projects: expanding the capacity of local telephone lines and introducing wireless mobile telephones.

　　成都投资亿元发展通信
    本报成都３月１５日电  记者陈华报道：新近计划单列的四川省成都市今年对通信业的投资，将首次超过１亿元。
    据了解，近两年来，成都市电信局先后投产了２．２万门程控电话，但待装的用户反比两年前增加了三倍多。“电话比彩电还俏！”这是当地人对供求矛盾的形象评说。
    市电信局局长张渝强介绍说，今年是通信发展投入资金最多的一年，投资的重点主要是市内电话扩容和引进无线移动电话等五大重点工程项目。
