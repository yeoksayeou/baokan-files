Rock Music Innovates
Cui Jian's Concert is Popular

Beijing, March 13 (Xinhua) — Reporter Yi Kai reports: After a year-long hiatus, the "rock singer" Cui Jian returned to the stage yesterday and today in Beijing, once again bringing his unique personality and sharp artistic edge to the city's music scene.

Cui Jian, who gained fame with the song "Nothing to My Name," suddenly stopped performing at the height of his popularity to focus on studying rock music. This effort paid off in his recent solo concert, where he showcased his refined songwriting, arrangement, and singing skills, all imbued with a rich sense of rhythm. Notably, he boldly incorporated traditional Chinese instruments like the guzheng and suona into rock music, achieving impressive artistic results. The Beijing audience enthusiastically welcomed Cui Jian's return. The Beijing Exhibition Hall was packed, with every seat taken. During the concert, each song by Cui Jian was met with thunderous applause and cheers. Some songs had the audience singing along, blending the stage and the audience into one.
