In recent years, the advancement of afforestation technology worldwide has been primarily reflected in the application of biotechnology. Breeding and nursery techniques have made significant progress. Tissue culture of forest trees has begun to be applied in production. The United States has used tissue-cultured torch pine seedlings for small-scale afforestation; New Zealand's Tasman Company commercially plants 100,000 tissue-cultured radiata pine seedlings annually; the Federal Republic of Germany uses tissue culture to mass-produce superior clones of European aspen. By the late 1970s, the application of isoenzymes in forest tree breeding research had increased significantly. It is now possible to effectively identify clones and determine the reliability of hybrids, and to estimate the hybrid rate at the seed stage. American scientists have also successfully fused cells from American elm and Chinese wild elm. More than 20% of the seedlings used for afforestation in countries like the United States, Sweden, Finland, and Japan are genetically improved superior seedlings. The use of biotechnology for container seedling cultivation has the advantages of high survival rate, extended afforestation season, and ease of mechanization, and is being adopted by an increasing number of countries. In Finland and Canada, container seedlings account for 57% and 49% of the total seedling production, respectively. The container seedling operations in Sweden and Finland have achieved a high degree of industrialization and automation.

Previously, the failure of seedling transplantation and afforestation was mainly due to water loss from the seedlings and mechanical damage to the root system. To address this, some countries have taken various scientific measures. New Zealand scientists have invented a new sowing method to reduce the exposure time of seedlings in the air and minimize damage to the root system. They changed the traditional row sowing method to a square sowing method and replaced the flat root pruning method with a box-shaped three-dimensional root pruning method, which prevents root entanglement. Simultaneously, the time from seedling extraction to planting is reduced to a few seconds, minimizing water loss and significantly improving the afforestation survival rate. The United States has developed a root growth control bag for seedlings, which increases the number of fine roots by seven times compared to traditional methods. The Soviet Union uses honey for cutting seedlings, which increases the rooting rate by about 50% compared to the control group.

To prevent new artificial forests from suffering from frost damage, wind damage, and wildlife predation, France began using transparent plastic protective sleeves in oak, white wax, and walnut artificial forests in the early 1980s, achieving satisfactory results. These sleeves have both protective and greenhouse effects. To prevent animals from damaging young seedlings, the United States places iodine-containing repellent tablets in the planting holes, reducing the animal damage rate by about 80% and causing no harm to the seedlings. Additionally, the United States has inserted an exogenous gene into a poplar hybrid, enhancing the poplar seedlings' resistance to herbicides.

    植树育苗有新法

    近年来，世界各国造林技术的进展主要表现在生物工程的应用上。育种和苗圃技术进展较快。林木组织培养已开始初步应用于生产。美国已用火炬松的组培苗进行小面积造林；新西兰塔斯曼公司每年商业种植十万株辐射松组培苗；联邦德国用组培法大规模繁殖欧洲山杨优良无性系。七十年代末，同功酶在林木遗传育种中的应用研究明显增多，现已能用来有效地鉴别无性系及鉴定杂交的可靠性，在种子阶段就可预估杂种率。美国科研人员还利用美国榆和中国北方野榆进行细胞融合已获得成功。如美国、瑞典、芬兰、日本等国造林采用的苗木有百分之二十以上都是经过遗传改良的良种苗。运用生物工程进行容器育苗，具有成活率高、造林季节长、便于机械化等优点，已被越来越多的国家所采用。芬兰和加拿大的容器苗分别占各自国家苗木总产量的百分之五十七和百分之四十九。瑞典和芬兰的容器育苗作业实现了高度的工厂化和自动化。
    以往苗木起苗造林失败，其原因主要是苗木水分蒸发和对根系的机械损伤。为此，一些国家采取了不少科学措施。新西兰科学家为减少苗木在空气中的暴露时间和减轻苗木根系的损伤，发明了一种新的播种方法。他们一改过去的条播法为方形播法，剪根由平面剪根法改为盒式三维剪根法，可避免根系的相互缠绕。同时，苗木从起出到栽植只暴露于空间数秒钟，减少了水分蒸发，使造林成活率大为提高。美国研制出一种苗根生长控制袋，可使苗木须根数量比传统方法多七倍。苏联利用蜂蜜扦插树苗，其生根率比对照组高百分之五十左右。
    为防止新的人工林遭受冻害、风害及野生动物啃食，法国从八十年代初开始在栎、白腊及胡桃等人工林中试用透明塑料防护套，取得了满意的结果。该套具有防护和温室双重效应。美国为预防动物对幼苗的啃食，在植树穴内放含碘驱兽药片，可降低兽害率百分之八十左右，对苗木无害。此外，美国把一种外源基因插入杨树杂种中，增强了杨树苗对除草剂的抗力。
