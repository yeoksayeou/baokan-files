Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 20th.

Seoul, March 20th—South Korean President Roh Tae-woo announced today that the "mid-term evaluation" will be postponed. The opposition group "National Democratic United Front" criticized Roh Tae-woo's decision as "a deception of the people."

Roh Tae-woo said in his speech that holding the "mid-term evaluation" under the current circumstances would lead to severe confrontation between the ruling and opposition parties and political chaos. To avoid the chaotic situation that occurred during last year's general election, he decided to temporarily suspend the "mid-term evaluation." Regarding when it will be held, Roh Tae-woo did not provide a clear timeline, only emphasizing that it will be discussed and resolved at an appropriate time when conditions are met.

According to reports, Roh Tae-woo made this decision primarily to deal with the current crisis. Roh Tae-woo is currently facing severe challenges from the opposition parties, as well as serious issues such as the expansion of labor disputes, the rise of the "anti-Roh" movement, and the surge in student activism.

　　卢泰愚推迟“中间评价”        
    在野团体认为是愚弄国民
    本报平壤３月２０日电  记者徐宝康报道：汉城消息，南朝鲜总统卢泰愚今天上午发表广播讲话，突然宣布“中间评价”延期举行。在野团体“全国民族民主联合会”指责卢泰愚的这一决定是“对国民的愚弄”。    
    卢泰愚在讲话中说，在目前的情况下，如果举行“中间评价”，将导致朝野之间的严重对立和政局的混乱。为避免重现去年大选时出现的混乱局势，决定暂不举行“中间评价”。至于何时举行，卢泰愚没有拿出一个明确的时间表，只强调在适当的时候，在条件具备后再协商解决。
    据报道，卢泰愚之所以宣布这一决定主要是为了应付目前出现的危机。卢泰愚目前不仅受到在野党的严峻挑战，而且还遭受劳资纠纷扩大、“倒卢”运动兴起、学生运动高涨等问题的严重困扰。
