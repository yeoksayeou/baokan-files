	Severe Water Inrush in Shaanxi White Water Coal Mine
	Six Workers Trapped Underground
	Rescued After Seven Days

	XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Xian, March 23 -- Six miners trapped in a coal mine in Baishui County, Shaanxi Province, for seven days after a severe water inrush were all rescued.

	At 9:58 PM on February 22, the Guomai Shareholding Joint Venture Small Coal Mine in Fenglei Town, Baishui County, suddenly experienced a severe water inrush. The water quickly filled the main and auxiliary tunnels, leaving the fate of the six miners who were working underground unknown.

	Upon receiving the news, Baishui County Party Secretary Zhang Bailin and County Magistrate Han Wuxiao rushed to the scene and established a rescue command center. Leaders from the Mining Bureau, Water Resources Bureau, Power Bureau, and hospitals, along with rescue teams, vehicles, and water pumps, hurried to the site. Nearby villages also sent many villagers to join the rescue efforts. Vice Director of the Weinan Regional Administration Bureau, Yan Runsuo, and leaders from provincial and municipal coal departments, along with engineering and technical personnel, arrived the next day. Rescue workers braved the dangers to enter the mine and install water pumps to drain the water. They worked in shifts around the clock, racing against time to pump out the water. It was not until the sixth day that the water level in the tunnels dropped by more than a meter. At this point, a young man entered the mine to search for the miners and heard faint voices from deep within the tunnel. He quickly shouted towards the sound and received a response: "We are all six alive!"

	The news that the six miners were alive brought great joy to the rescuers. They quickly added more water pumps and increased the pumping speed. On March 1, they finally rescued the six miners.

	It turned out that when the water inrush occurred, the fierce water blocked the path to the mine entrance. Team leader Han Changqing quickly led his comrades to the highest point of the auxiliary shaft. The water quickly filled the main and auxiliary tunnels, but fortunately, when they were forced into a higher small cave, the water stopped rising. In the deathly silence, the six comrades encouraged each other, enduring the unbearable hunger and cold, and finally waited for the arrival of the rescue team.

　　陕西白水煤井严重透水        
    六人被困井下        
    七天遇救生还
    新华社西安３月２３日电  （通讯员种白仓、王友民）被大水困于陕西省白水县煤井下７天的６名矿工，经各方抢救全部生还。
    ２月２２日晚９时５８分，白水县冯雷镇郭峁股份联办小煤井，突然发生严重透水事故，大水很快将主、副巷道全部灌满，正在井下挖煤的６名矿工生死不明。
    消息传来，白水县县委书记张百灵和县长韩武孝很快赶到现场，成立了抢救指挥部全力营救。矿务局、水利局、电力局、医院等领导干部带着抢救队员、车辆、水泵等赶到现场，附近两个村也派出许多村民参加抢救。渭南地区行署副专员严润锁和省、地煤炭等部门领导和工程技术人员也于第二天赶来。抢救人员冒着危险下井安装水泵向外抽水。他们一天三班倒，不分昼夜争分夺秒排水。一直到第６天，巷道里的水才降了一米多。这时，一位青年下到井里寻找矿工下落，听见从巷道深处传来微弱的声音。他赶忙朝发声处喊话，得到的回音是：“我们６个人都活着！”
    ６位矿工活着的消息使营救者欣喜万分。他们赶紧增加抽水机器，加快抽水速度，３月１日终于救出了这６名矿工。
    原来，当发生透水事故时，来势凶猛的水头挡住了通往井口的去路，班长韩长青急中生智，带领同伴向副井最高处跑去。大水很快灌满主副巷道，幸运的是当他们被逼进一个较高的小窑洞里时，水停止了上涨。在死一样的寂静中，６个伙伴相互鼓励，忍着难熬的饥饿与寒冷，终于盼到了营救人员的到来。
