In the western part of Ecuador, near the equator in the Pacific Ocean, there is an island group called the Galapagos. "Galapagos" means "tortoise" in ancient Spanish, so it is also called Tortoise Island. The island is scenic, with unusual flowers and plants, as well as strange birds and beasts. The most interesting are the land tortoises and sea turtles. The land tortoises are very large, over 1 meter tall and weighing more than 250 kilograms, making them one of the oldest animals in the world. Local residents often catch land tortoises for children to ride on, and use the tortoise shells as cradles for babies.

　　龟岛
    在厄瓜多尔西部临近赤道的太平洋中，有一个叫加拉帕戈斯的群岛。“加拉帕戈斯”在古代西班牙语里是龟的意思，所以又叫龟岛。岛上风景旖旎，到处是奇花异草和珍禽怪兽。最有趣的是陆龟和海龟。陆龟非常大，高１米多，重达２５０多公斤，是世界上最古老的动物之一。当地居民常捉拿陆龟来给孩子当马骑；用龟壳作婴儿的摇篮。
