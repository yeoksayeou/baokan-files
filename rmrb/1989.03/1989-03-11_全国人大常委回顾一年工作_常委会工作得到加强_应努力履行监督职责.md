The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) reviewed its work over the past year before the convening of the Second Session of the Seventh NPC. The committee members generally felt that over the past year, the NPC Standing Committee, in accordance with the powers granted by the Constitution, had improved and strengthened its work. In developing socialist democracy, improving socialist legal systems, and promoting and ensuring modernization and reform and opening up, it had made new progress. However, there were still shortcomings in supervising the work of the State Council, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, which needed further improvement and effort.

Starting from yesterday afternoon, the members of the Seventh NPC Standing Committee, who are attending the Seventh Session, held group discussions to review the draft report of the NPC Standing Committee, which is to be submitted to the Second Session of the Seventh NPC for deliberation.

Wang Houde, a member of the committee, said that, in general, the Standing Committee had done a lot of work over the past year. However, considering the political and economic situation over the past year and the powers granted by the Constitution and laws, we have not overstepped our authority, but there have been instances of dereliction of duty.

Zhang Ting and Song Qingzhi, members of the committee, believed that the legislative work of the Standing Committee had achieved great results, but the supervision of the implementation of laws was not sufficient, and the phenomenon of having laws but not following them was still serious. There were more problems in the supervision of work. Yao Guang, a member of the committee, suggested that the relationship between "supervision" and "support" should be clarified in the report—whether they are contradictory or consistent.

Yang Jike, a member of the committee, believed that the NPC should establish an inspection committee and an auditing and statistical committee. Only in this way could the work of the government be effectively supervised.

Chen Shunheng, a member of the committee, pointed out that the main shortcomings of the NPC's work lay in the fulfillment of its supervisory responsibilities. In legal supervision and work supervision, there was much to be desired. The NPC's supervision of the government, by making suggestions, proposals, and criticisms, was actually a support for the government's work and should not be confused with interfering with administrative power.

Zhang Shiming, a member of the committee, said that the NPC should not only examine and approve the national economic plan and budget report but also supervise their implementation. If there are changes in the specific implementation process, they should be reported to the NPC and its Standing Committee, and the opinions of the deputies and committee members should be heard to reduce mistakes in the work. Qin Chuan and Gao Xiu, members of the committee, suggested that the report should clearly state the situation of the NPC's lack of supervision and propose specific improvement measures.

### 全国人大常委回顾一年工作  常委会工作得到加强  应努力履行监督职责

　　全国人大常委回顾一年工作
    常委会工作得到加强  应努力履行监督职责
    新华社北京３月１０日电  全国人大常委会委员在七届全国人大二次会议即将召开之前，回首一年的工作时普遍感到，一年来，全国人大常委会根据宪法赋予的职权，改进和加强常委会的工作，在发展社会主义民主，健全社会主义法制，促进和保障现代化建设和改革开放方面，取得了新的进展。但是，在对“一府两院”实行监督方面有失职的现象，还有待进一步改进和努力。
    从昨天下午开始，出席七届全国人大常委会七次会议的委员分组审议了准备提交七届全国人大二次会议审议的全国人大常委会工作报告。
    王厚德委员说，总的来看，一年来人大常委会做了许多工作，但是，根据宪法和法律赋予的职权，同时考虑到一年来政治、经济状况，我们没有越权，但失职是有的。
    张挺、宋承志委员认为，人大常委会立法工作成绩很大，但如何监督法律实施却做得不够，有法不依的现象仍很严重，工作监督方面的问题更多。姚广委员提出，“监督”与“支持”到底是什么关系，是矛盾的，还是一致的，在报告中应予明确。
    杨纪珂委员认为，人大应成立监察委员会、审计统计委员会，只有这样，才能对政府的工作实行有效的监督。
    陈邃衡委员指出，人大工作的不足之处主要体现在履行监督职责方面，在法律监督和工作监督方面，都做得很不够。人大对政府实行监督，提意见、建议和批评，实际上是对政府工作的支持，而不能同干预行政权力混为一谈。
    章师明委员说，人大不仅要审查和批准国民经济计划和预算报告，而且要监督其执行情况。如果在具体执行过程中有变动，应向人大及其常委会汇报，听取代表和委员的意见，以减少工作中的失误。秦川、高修等委员建议，报告对人大监督不力的情况应讲得明确，并提出具体改进的办法。
