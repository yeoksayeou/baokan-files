Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 13th. Reporter Xu Baokang reports: The Ministry of People's Armed Forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today, strongly condemning the "Team Spirit 89" military exercises conducted by the United States and South Korea. The statement asserted that these exercises are an intolerable provocation against North Korea's peace efforts and a criminal act that goes against the global trend of détente.

The statement said, "The 'Team Spirit 89' joint military exercises not only disrupt the atmosphere of dialogue but also seriously threaten the North-South dialogue. This fully proves that the 'peace' and 'détente' advocated by the United States and South Korea are mere deception. No matter how the United States and South Korea claim that the military exercises are 'defensive training,' this cannot conceal their aggressive and provocative nature."

The statement concluded by demanding that the United States immediately stop the military exercises and withdraw all its troops and weapons from South Korea.

　　朝鲜人民武装力量部声明
    谴责美与南朝鲜军事演习
    本报平壤３月１３日电  记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜人民武装力量部发言人今天发表声明，强烈谴责美国和南朝鲜举行“协作精神８９”军事演习，并指出，这是对朝鲜北方和平努力的不可容忍的挑战，是逆世界缓和潮流而动的犯罪行为。
    声明说，“协作精神８９”联合军事演习，不仅破坏了对话气氛，而且严重地威胁着北南对话。这充分证明，美国和南朝鲜叫嚷的“和平”、“缓和”是欺人之谈。无论美国和南朝鲜怎样标榜军事演习是“防御训练”，但这决不能掩盖其进攻和挑衅的性质。
    声明最后要求美国立即停止军事演习，从南朝鲜撤走全部军队和武器。
