The Xingdian Forest Farm implemented the responsibility system, and Party Secretary He Jizhou led the workers to green 160,000 mu of barren mountains and artificially cultivate 1,900 mu of Eucommia ulmoides. The once unremarkable township-run forest farm has been built into a Eucommia ulmoides base. Now, Xingdian Forest Farm has over 600 mu of Eucommia ulmoides that can be exported to earn foreign exchange. Not only has it paid off old debts, but it also makes a profit of over 200,000 yuan each year, with an average income of over 1,000 yuan per person.

Old He is in his forties, upright and incorruptible. He does not take a single cent of money from unknown sources and dares to resist crooked ways. In 1988, Eucommia ulmoides was in high demand both domestically and internationally, and many merchants came to buy it. Some merchants wanted to give Old He a kickback, while others were willing to pay a handling fee, but Old He neither took it openly nor secretly. Once, a merchant came to Old He at night and said, "Sell me two tons of Eucommia ulmoides, and I'll give you 1,000 yuan as a kickback." Saying this, he pushed a stack of money towards Old He. Old He's face turned dark, and he stood up and said, "You're trying to take advantage of me, but you won't succeed!" The merchant could only leave dejectedly.

Another time, a leading comrade said to Old He, "I want to buy some Eucommia ulmoides. If you agree, I'll give you a large color TV." Old He replied, "We are all Communist Party members and must act according to the rules. We must let the people see that Communist Party members are good, and the Communist Party is good!" These words made the leading comrade blush.

Under Old He's influence, the Party members and cadres of Xingdian Forest Farm strictly adhere to the Party branch's clean government measures, selling all the Eucommia ulmoides to the state. Among the Party members who built houses in the entire farm, not one bought timber from the forest farm. The people praise Old He and the Party branch he leads as the "guardian spirits" of the forest farm.

　　绿化荒山　廉洁奉公        
    何积洲是林场的守护神
    星甸林场实行责任制以后，党支部书记何积洲带领职工绿化荒山１６万亩，人工栽培杜仲１９００多亩，把原来不起眼的乡办林场建设成一个杜仲基地。如今星甸林场已有６００多亩杜仲可出口赚取外汇，不但还清了陈年欠债，而且每年盈利２０多万元，人均收入１０００多元。
    老何今年４０多岁，廉洁奉公，来路不明的钱，他一分也不要，并且敢于抵制歪门邪道。１９８８年，杜仲在国内外市场上十分紧俏，不少商贩前来买杜仲。有的商贩要给老何回扣，有的愿付手续费，但老何明不取，暗不收。一次，一个商贩晚上找到老何说：“你卖我两吨杜仲，我给你１０００元回扣。”说着，便把一大叠钱推到老何面前。老何脸色铁青，站起来说：“想打我的主意，办不到！”那个商贩只好灰溜溜地走了。
    又一次，一个领导同志对老何说：“我想买些杜仲，你若答应，给你台大彩电”。老何却说：“我们都是共产党员，要按章程办事，要让群众从我们身上感到共产党员好，共产党好！”一句话，说得那位领导人面红耳赤。
    在老何的带动下，星甸林场的党员干部都严格遵守党支部的廉政措施，把杜仲全部卖给国家。全场家里盖房的党员中，没有一人在林场买木料。群众赞扬老何和他领导的党支部是林场的“守护神”。
