	Seek Truth from Facts and Treat the Symptoms Accordingly
	——National People's Congress Deputy, Wenzhou Municipal Committee Secretary Dong Chaocai on Guiding Consumption

	Reporter: Pan Gang

	Wenzhou youth indulge in high consumption: a pair of leather shoes costs 1,200 yuan, a coat 8,000 yuan, and they buy them anyway; Wenzhou farmers indulge in high consumption: chairs tombs priced at tens of thousands of yuan are everywhere.

	National People's Congress Deputy, Wenzhou Municipal Committee Secretary Dong Chaocai analyzed that, apart from these people seeking vanity and showing off, it is also related to the unclear national policy on the private economy. Since 1987, Wenzhou City has formulated regulations for the management of private enterprises, thereby stabilizing the fear of change in these people and guiding them to use their money for expanding production. Various places have strengthened political and ideological work, and collective weddings for young people have gradually increased, and the construction of "chair tombs" has also decreased.

	Dong Chaocai said that as long as young people act within their means and dress well with their own earnings, there is nothing wrong with that. Young people should be guided correctly, and administrative intervention must be avoided.

	Dong Chaocai believes that the emergence of extravagance and waste is ultimately a reflection of low personal quality. In fact, with the development of the commodity economy, people's spirit of adventure and competitiveness have increased compared to the past. He gave an example, saying that now Wenzhou youth are very eager to learn. After Wenzhou was hit by a disaster, it was these young people who rebuilt their homes.

　　实事求是　对症下药        
    ——人大代表、温州市委书记董朝才谈引导消费
    本报记者  潘岗
    温州青年高消费：一双皮鞋１２００元，一件大衣８０００元，照买；温州农民高消费：造价数千上万元的“椅子坟”鳞次栉比。
    全国人大代表、温州市委书记董朝才分析说，除了这些人图虚荣、讲“派头”外，与国家对私营经济政策不明确有关。１９８７年以来，温州市制定了私营企业管理条例，从而稳定了这些人的怕变心理，引导他们将钱用在扩大再生产上。各地普遍加强了政治思想工作，青年集体婚礼逐渐增多，建“椅子坟”也少了。
    董朝才说，青年人只要量力而行，用自己挣来的钱穿得好一些，也没有什么不好。对青年人应正确地加以引导，千万不要行政干预。
    董朝才认为，铺张浪费等现象的出现，归根到底，还是人的素质差的反映。其实，随着商品经济的发展，人们的冒险精神、竞争意识比过去增强了。他举例说，现在温州青年非常好学。温州遭灾后，重建家园的就是这些年轻人。
