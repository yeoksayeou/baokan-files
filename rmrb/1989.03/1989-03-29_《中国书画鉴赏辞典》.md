Edition: 8

The appreciation of art is a subjective activity for the art appreciator. A dictionary requires scientific rigor and the introduction of knowledge, along with rational judgment. Combining these two aspects is the original intention behind the compilation of the "Dictionary of Chinese Calligraphy and Painting Appreciation" by China Youth Press: it not only guides appreciation but also introduces knowledge.

Chinese calligraphy and painting emerged in a unique and ancient cultural environment. Over thousands of years, they have traversed a long journey from their inception, through infancy and maturity, to change, and from practical use to artistic expression. The dictionary includes 1,243 entries on calligraphy and painting from various dynasties, spanning from the Neolithic period to the present day. Each entry explains the era, school, style evolution, and historical evaluations of the artists and their works. Each piece of art is accompanied by illustrations. Through text and images, one can gain an understanding of the development and changes in Chinese calligraphy and painting art.

　　《中国书画鉴赏辞典》
    艺术鉴赏是艺术欣赏者的主观活动。辞典要求科学性，需要介绍知识，有理性判断。将二者合一，是中国青年出版社出版《中国书画鉴赏辞典》的编纂初衷：既引导鉴赏，又介绍知识。
    中国的书法与绘画是在一种特殊而古老的文明环境中产生的。几千年来，它们走过了从发端、童稚、成熟到变化，由实用到艺术化的漫长路程。辞典共收历代绘画、书法条目１２４３个，上从新时器时代、下迄当代，条目释文兼及作家作品的时代环境、流派承续、风格演变及历代评价等。每幅作品都有图例。图文并茂，从中领略到中国书法和绘画艺术发展变化的历程。
