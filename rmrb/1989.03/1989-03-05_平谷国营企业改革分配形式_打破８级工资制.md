Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 4th.

The 172 state-owned enterprises in Pinggu County, excluding some special industries, have completely abolished the eight-grade wage system and implemented a distribution method based on individual contributions. County Party Secretary Liu Fuhai explained that the leaders of each enterprise are best positioned to determine the value of each position within their enterprise and to assess how much each individual should be paid. After a year of effort, the following distribution methods have been explored: commercial, construction, and enterprises with relatively simple products implement quantity-based wages; administrative departments without rigid indicators and highly mechanized production lines implement position-based wages; purchasing, catering, and service industries implement commission-based wages; technical personnel, veteran workers, and veteran cadres implement structural wages.

Practice has shown that these wage systems complement each other, and enterprises can adopt different methods based on their specific situations, either singly or in combination, thereby eliminating egalitarianism in distribution.

Currently, in the state-owned enterprises of this county, incomes vary from person to person and from month to month. People have begun to develop a new concept: for enterprises, to issue more bonuses, they must improve efficiency; for individuals, to earn more, they must work harder.

　　平谷国营企业改革分配形式
    打破８级工资制
    本报北京３月４日讯  记者颜世贵报道：京郊平谷县１７２家国营企业（除一些特殊行业），彻底打破８级工资制，根据贡献大小给报酬。县委书记刘福海介绍说，每个企业的领导最有资格确定本企业每个岗位的价值，最了解每个人应得多少工资。经过一年努力，目前探索出这几种分配形式：商业、建筑及产品比较单一的企业，实行含量工资；没有硬指标的后勤科室和机械化程度较高的生产流水线，实行岗位工资；购销、饮食、服务行业，实行提成工资；技术人员、老工人、老干部，实行结构工资。
    实践表明，这几种工资形式相配套，企业视不同情况而采纳，有的单一，有的兼而有之，破除了分配中的平均主义。
    现在，在这个县的国营企业，人与人之间、月与月之间收入都不一样。人们开始树立了一个新的观念：对企业来说，要想多发奖金，就得提高效益；对个人来说，要想多拿钱，就得多干活。
