The manager's heart ablaze, warms workers' hearts, and spreads to users: Fang Guozheng's "Fireball Theory"

Those in the know understand that running a liquefied gas supply station is a money-losing business. The more gas sold, the greater the loss, and naturally, workers' bonuses are not high. However, the manager of a liquefied gas supply station in Beijing, Fang Guozheng, has made his enterprise thrive. Everyone is enthusiastic, and the station has been named a model unit in Beijing year after year. Recently, the company conducted a user survey, and the results showed that 99.7% of users were satisfied with Fang Guozheng's Hujiayuan station.

At 36 years old, what secret does Fang Guozheng have? He explains it this way: "Use the fire in your heart to illuminate the hearts of every worker; when the workers' hearts are warm, they will naturally pass on their love to thousands of users."

Young worker Liu Jingyang used to be addicted to smoking, drinking, and gambling, and he didn't work hard, earning him the nickname "Three Ghosts." Higher-ups, seeing that he was incorrigible, planned to fire him. Fang Guozheng wanted to help him. Liu lived at the station, and Fang Guozheng didn't go home either; he did the laundry and mended the quilts. Liu liked to play, so Fang Guozheng spent his free time taking photos and fishing with him, seizing the opportunity to have a heart-to-heart talk. Once, Liu was absent from work for several days, and Fang Guozheng braved the rain to ride his bike for over two hours to visit him, warming Liu's heart. Liu repeatedly said, "Brother Fang, I'll do whatever you do."

Liu really changed. His work became more outstanding, and higher-ups wanted to transfer him to Dashanzi station to be the manager. Before leaving, he held Fang Guozheng's hand, tears streaming down his face: "Brother Fang, you wanted me to prove myself, right? Now you'll see."

Not long after Liu arrived at Dashanzi station, he indeed turned a lagging station into one that was relatively satisfactory to users.

In the station, every worker can recount several instances of "Brother Fang" doing good deeds for them. Xiaogeng's father was bedridden, and Fang Guozheng visited him at home. Seeing that there was no refrigerator in the house, making it inconvenient for the patient to live, Fang Guozheng immediately went home and took the refrigerator ticket, which his sister had obtained with great difficulty, and gave it to Xiaogeng. Liu Fengzhen's husband's workplace was far from home, and Fang Guozheng went everywhere to plead on his behalf, finally helping Liu Fengzhen's husband transfer to a workplace near home.

The workers, having received love, passed it on to the users without hesitation. The work of replacing gas cylinders is heavy, with each person carrying 4 tons of liquefied gas cylinders every day. Yet, everyone still wanted to give more to the users. When users brought empty cylinders to exchange for gas, the station weighed each one. If there was any remaining gas, they immediately refunded the money. For the elderly, weak, and women who found it inconvenient to exchange gas, they recorded the names of those in difficulty and delivered cylinders to their doors at regular intervals, without taking any payment.

Not long ago, during the election of people's representatives in the Hujiayuan area, many voters who directly or indirectly knew Fang Guozheng cast their votes for him. They hoped that Fang Guozheng could promote his "Fireball Theory" further.

　　站长心中一团火，烧热职工心，再传给用户
    方国政的“火团理论”
    懂行情的人都知道，经营液化气是个赔本的买卖，出售越多，亏损越大，职工奖金自然也高不了。然而，京都一家液化气供应站站长方国政却把企业办得挺红火，大伙儿的劲鼓起来了，站里年年被评为北京市先进单位。前不久，公司作了一次用户抽样调查，结果有９９．７％的用户给方国政所在的呼家楼站投了满意票。
    ３６岁的方国政有何绝招？他这样解密：“用自己心里的火团去照亮每个职工的心；职工心头热了，自然会将爱送给千百个用户。”
    青年工人刘敬阳，过去嗜烟酒，爱赌博，就是工作不上劲，被人称为“三鬼”。上级看他屡教不改，准备将他开除。方国政一心想帮助他。小刘住在站上，方国政也不回家；洗衣服，缝被褥，方国政把这些活包下来；小刘喜欢玩，方国政便工余陪他照像、钓鱼，趁机推心置腹一番。一次，小刘几天未上班，方国政冒雨骑车两个多小时赶去看望，把小刘的心暖得热乎乎的。小刘一遍遍地说：“方哥，以后你咋干我咋干。”
    小刘真的变了，他的工作越来越出色，上级要调他到大山子站当站长。临别前，他拉着方国政的手，眼泪刷刷往下流：“方哥，你不是希望我争口气吗？以后你看我的。”小刘到大山子站不久，果然把一个后进站调理得让用户比较满意了。
    在站里，哪个职工不能道出几件“方哥”给自己办的好事。小耿父亲瘫痪在床，方国政上门探视，见屋内没有冰箱，病人生活不便，即刻回家把妹妹好不容易弄到的冰箱票要来给了小耿；刘凤贞的爱人单位离家远，他到处磕头，终于帮刘凤贞的爱人调到离家近的单位工作。
    职工们得到了爱，又把爱毫不吝惜地传与用户。换气活儿重，光搬运液化气钢瓶每人每天摊４吨。可大伙儿还想着给用户奉献更多。用户提来空瓶换气，站里逐个过秤，若有剩气，立即退款。老弱妇孺换气不便，他们将困难户登记入册，定时送瓶上门，不取分文报酬。
    不久前，呼家楼地区选市人大代表，许许多多直接或间接了解方国政的选民把票投给了他。他们期望，方国政能把他的“火团理论”推广开去。
