In the Zhongfa residential community in the eastern part of Beijing, one often hears the soft strains of a piano floating through the air. Upon listening, one finds that the melodies are all famous tunes from the 1930s and 1940s; upon closer inspection, one can faintly hear an old man's voice humming along.

This is not a renowned artistic household. The pianist is an ordinary housewife—80-year-old Zhang Wanyi, and the singer is her husband, the textile expert Zhou Chunzuo.

The couple has been married for 63 years, enduring the military wars, the Anti-Japanese War, the War of Liberation, and the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, moving through Jiangsu, Shanghai, Shandong, Tianjin, Beijing, and Hubei. Through numerous storms and trials, they have supported each other, weathering the storms together. Mr. Zhou Chunzuo is a member of the 4th, 5th, and 6th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. After the Cultural Revolution, he served as the deputy director of the Textile Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Textile Industry. Now, at the age of 83, he still reads the newspapers diligently every day and enjoys thinking. His views on economic issues have been published in some newspapers. When the reporter went to interview him, he took out a recent article—“How to Make Stocks Serve Socialism”—and asked the reporter to submit it for publication.

Mrs. Zhang Wanyi took care of the household and educated their children after the war. Their two sons and one daughter are now senior engineers or associate professors, and their grandchildren have all completed their studies and are serving the public and society.

In the spring of 1986, it was the couple's 60th wedding anniversary. Mrs. Zhang Wanyi proposed not to hold a banquet or accept gifts, but only to ask their descendants to write poems in commemoration. Some close relatives and friends, upon hearing the news, also sent poems. The couple's “Fifteen Poems on Remembrance” was printed together with these poems in a self-funded collection titled “Family Celebration.”

A son-in-law returning from abroad brought back an electronic piano for Mrs. Zhang Wanyi. To comfort his wife, who had stopped playing the piano and forgotten the tunes, Mr. Zhou Chunzuo transcribed some old scores from memory, and the music was revived. Now, they get up at dawn every day, with Mrs. Zhang Wanyi preparing breakfast, and then they go together to fetch milk and take a walk. After that, they return to the small garden in front of their house to practice Tai Chi together. They spend one hour each in the morning and afternoon, either playing chess for entertainment, discussing poetry, or playing the piano and singing together. New works are constantly being added to their family poetry collection:

		Flowers bloom anew every day, spring eternal in the small courtyard,
		Flowers bloom in spring, people live long,
		The moon is full, flowers are beautiful, joy knows no bounds. (Zhou Chunzuo, “Song in Front of the Flowers”)

		The morning light is faint, the birds fly at dawn,
		Practicing in the pine forest, dew wets the clothes,
		After practicing Tai Chi, the body is healthy,
		Leaning on canes, they slowly return home. (Zhang Wanyi, “Morning Exercise”)

　　吟到白头歌更多
    本报记者  冯媛
    在北京城东的中纺里居民小区，你常可以听到袅袅的琴音飘荡。辨其旋律，皆是三四十年代的名曲；驻足谛听，依稀可闻一苍老男音低声相和。
    这不是一个名闻遐迩的艺术之家。弹琴的是一普通主妇——八旬老人章婉仪，唱和的是她的丈夫、纺织专家邹春座。
    老两口结婚已经六十三年了，其间历经军阀内战、抗日战争、解放战争和“文革”内乱，辗转江苏、上海、山东、天津、北京、湖北等地。几度风雨，几度沉浮，他俩都相依相助，度尽劫波。邹春座先生是第四、五、六届全国政协委员，“文革”后还任纺织部纺织科学研究院副院长。现在虽已八十有三，但他每天仍勤于阅报，乐于思考。他的关于经济问题的见解，曾见诸一些报刊。记者前去采访时，他还取出一篇近作——《如何才能使股票为社会主义服务》，让记者代为投稿。
    章婉仪老太太抗战后专理家务和教育子女。他们的二子一女现在已是高级工程师或副教授，孙子外孙们也都完成了学业，服务于公众和社会。
    一九八六年春节，是老两口结婚六十周年，老太太章婉仪倡议不请客不受礼，唯求晚辈献诗留念。一些至亲好友闻讯，也纷纷鸿雁传诗。老两口的“戏作忆旧十五题”，也和这些诗一起自费印成了一册《家庆纪念》诗集。
    女婿出国归来，为章婉仪捎回一架电子琴。为安慰老伴因辍琴忘调，邹春座凭记忆抄出一些旧谱，唱随之乐得以重续。他们现在每天黎明即起，老太太备好早餐后双双去取牛奶、散步，然后回到家门前的小花圃同练太极；他们每天上下午各抽一小时，或围棋消遣，或书诗切磋，或琴歌酬唱，家庭诗抄中，不断增添新作：
    百花日日换新红，四季如春小院中，花自长春人自寿，月圆花好乐无穷。（邹春座《花前酬唱》）
    晨色稀微宿鸟飞，松林同练露湿衣，拳罢太极身形健，双杖相扶缓缓归。（章婉仪《清晨锻炼》）
