The signing of the Southwest African Peace Agreement by Angola, Cuba, South Africa, and the United States under American mediation has ushered in a new era of peace and development for Southern Africa. Namibia is set to achieve independence on November 1, 1989. With Namibia's independence, the entire continent of Africa will have completed its decolonization process.

A Significant Achievement

Namibia has been under the rule of South Africa's apartheid regime for 74 years. The United Nations has repeatedly demanded that South Africa withdraw from Namibia, but the South African authorities have consistently ignored these demands. It was not until December 22, 1988, that the four parties—Angola, Cuba, South Africa, and the United States—reached an agreement in New York. This agreement stipulated that Cuba would withdraw its 50,000 troops from Angola within 27 months, while also implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, which was passed 10 years ago, to allow Namibia to move towards independence.

The Southwest African Peace Agreement clearly stipulates that South Africa's tens of thousands of troops in Namibia must be completely withdrawn by November 1, 1989, ending South Africa's administrative control over Namibia. Angola, Cuba, and South Africa have agreed not to interfere in Namibia's internal affairs and not to use their territories to threaten Namibia's independence and security. Thus, Namibia's long-standing war and South Africa's oppression will come to an end. This is a significant achievement of the long-term struggle by African countries, particularly the frontline states, and a major victory for the international community, especially African countries, in their fight against racism. An independent Namibia joining the ranks of the Organization of African Unity will strengthen the unity of African countries.

A Good Start

According to the agreement reached by the four parties, Cuba is withdrawing its troops from Angola in phases, and the implementation of Resolution 435 on Namibia's independence has begun.

The United Nations Secretary-General has quickly dispatched a mission to assist Namibia. The United Nations has allocated $416 million as operational funds for the mission during Namibia's transitional period. A peacekeeping force of 4,650 personnel, 1,700 logistical staff, 300 military observers, and 100 headquarters staff have already arrived in Namibia to begin preparations for various tasks.

South Africa's "cabinet government" in Namibia announced its dissolution on February 28. Before the elections, Namibia will be managed jointly by the South African administrator in Namibia and the United Nations Special Representative. South African Army Commander Jani Herdenis announced on January 27 that South Africa has begun withdrawing its troops and equipment from Namibia. He stated that South Africa will strictly adhere to the terms of Resolution 435, and the withdrawal of the last batch of troops will be completed within a week after the election date in Namibia is confirmed.

The South West Africa People's Organization has achieved a ceasefire with South African forces. The 69,000-plus Namibian refugees in Angola will begin returning to their country in phases starting May 15 over a six-week period to participate in the November elections. It appears that the implementation of Resolution 435 and the realization of the four-party agreement have had a good start.

Challenges Ahead

Namibia's journey to true independence will not be smooth sailing.

Firstly, will South Africa renege on its commitments, create obstacles, and delay Namibia's independence process? South Africa has a history of such actions and has recently taken steps to create obstacles and hinder the elections.

Secondly, can Namibia hold free and fair elections and form a government smoothly? Namibia has a population of 1.59 million, with 11 major tribes and over 40 political parties, making the situation very complex. However, it is estimated that under the specific assistance and supervision of the United Nations mission, the elections will proceed as scheduled.

Thirdly, which party will win the elections? What path will the ruling party take? This is a matter of concern for Africa and the international community. The "People's Organization" led by Nujoma has fought for national liberation for over 20 years and enjoys the support of the Namibian people. However, they also have a weak domestic base and need to do more work among the voters through the elections. Additionally, domestic factions such as the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance and the Patriotic Front, composed of three parties, are also actively campaigning to gain more votes. Nujoma, the chairman, said that if his organization wins, it will establish a democratic socialist state with a mixed economy; his government will implement a policy of national reconciliation and hopes that foreign companies will expand their investments in Namibia. Currently, there are over 70,000 whites in Namibia who have capital, technical skills, and management experience. How to handle them requires a prudent policy.

Furthermore, there is the issue of the sovereignty of Walvis Bay. Currently under South African control, it belongs to Namibia, but South Africa refuses to hand it over, which may lead to disputes between South Africa and Namibia. How to resolve this is still uncertain.

In summary, Namibia's independence is imminent, and people hope that all parties involved will follow the trend of détente, making efforts to promote and realize Namibia's independence process, rather than the opposite.

### 跨上独立征程的纳米比亚

　　跨上独立征程的纳米比亚
    安哥拉、古巴、南非在美国调解下，正式签署的西南部非洲和平协议，为南部非洲开创了一个和平、发展的新阶段。纳米比亚将在今年１１月１日实现独立。纳米比亚独立之时，将是全非洲实现非殖民化之日。
    　　　　重大的成果
    纳米比亚被南非种族主义政权统治了长达７４年。联合国曾多次要求南非撤出纳米比亚，南非当局始终置若罔闻。直到去年１２月２２日，安、古、南、美４方在纽约达成协议，要古巴驻安哥拉的５万军队在２７个月内撤走，同时规定，从今年４月１日起实施联合国安理会１０年前通过的关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议，使纳米比亚走上独立。
    西南部非洲和平协议明确规定，南非在纳米比亚的数万军队，到１９８９年１１月１日前全部撤出，结束南非对纳米比亚的行政管理，安、古、南３方同意不干涉纳米比亚的内政，不得把本国领土用来威胁纳的独立和安全。这样，纳米比亚旷日持久的战乱与南非的奴役将告结束。这是非洲国家、特别是前线国家长期斗争的重大成果，也是国际社会、尤其是非洲国家抗击种族主义斗争的一大胜利。独立的纳米比亚加入非洲统一组织的行列，有利于增强非洲国家团结的力量。
    　　　　良好的开端
    根据４方达成的协议，古巴正分阶段从安哥拉撤军，执行关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议也已迈开步伐。
    联合国秘书长迅速派出赴纳米比亚的援助团。联合国已拨款４．１６亿美元作为援助团在纳米比亚过渡时期的活动经费。一支４６５０人组成的维持和平部队、１７００名后勤人员、３００名军事观察员和１００名总部工作人员已经抵达纳米比亚，开始筹备各项工作。
    南非在纳米比亚的“内阁政府”已于２月２８日宣布解散。大选前，纳米比亚由南非在纳的行政长官同联合国派出的特别代表一道管理。南非陆军司令詹尼·赫尔登伊斯１月２７日向报界宣布，南非已经开始从纳米比亚撤出它的军队和装备。他表示，南非将严格履行４３５号决议的条款，最后一批军队的撤离工作将在纳米比亚选举日期确定后的一周内完成。
    西南非洲人民组织已同南非军队实现停火。在安哥拉的６．９万多纳米比亚难民，将于５月１５日起的６周内陆续返国，以便参加１１月的独立大选。看来，实施４３５号决议和落实４方协议已有了良好的开端。
    　　　　面临的考验
    纳米比亚要跨上真正独立的征程不会是一帆风顺的。
    首先，南非是否会出尔反尔、节外生枝、拖延纳米比亚的独立进程。南非以往在这方面是有劣迹的，最近也有制造障碍、妨碍大选的举动。
    其次，纳米比亚能否进行自由、公正的大选，顺利组成政府。纳米比亚人口１５９万，有１１个大部族，４０多个政党，情况很复杂。不过，人们估计，在联合国援助团的具体协助与监督下大选会如期举行。
    第三，大选中哪个政党会赢得胜利？执政党会走什么道路？这是非洲和国际社会普遍关注的。努乔马领导的“人民组织”为民族解放进行了２０多年的斗争，受到纳米比亚人民的拥戴，但是，他们在国内也有基础薄弱的一面，需要通过竞选做好选民的工作。另外，纳米比亚的国内派，诸如特恩哈尔民主联盟以及由３个政党组成的民族爱国阵线等党派，也都在积极进行竞选，争取获得更多的选票。努乔马主席说，如果他的组织获胜，将建立一个混合经济体系的“民主的社会主义国家”；他的政府将执行民族和解政策，希望外国公司在纳米比亚扩大投资。目前在纳米比亚有白人７万多，他们拥有资金、懂得技术、又会管理，如何对待他们需要有妥善的政策。
    此外，还有一个沃尔维斯湾的归属问题。现在在南非控制下，它本属纳米比亚，但南非拒不交还，这可能会引起南非与纳米比亚之间的争端，如何解决尚难预测。
    总之，纳米比亚的独立指日可待，人们期望有关各方顺应缓和潮流的大势，努力推动和实现纳米比亚的独立进程，而不是相反。
