The Shantou International Trade Development Company has, since the beginning of this year, adapted to the needs of homeland construction by actively leveraging the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Teochew compatriots around the world. It has decisively established business networks overseas and gradually set up overseas joint ventures, taking new steps towards becoming a transnational company and achieving initial successes.

In January of this year, the company co-hosted the "China Shantou Export Commodities Exhibition" in New York City, USA, showcasing thousands of Teochew products for the first time in the United States. This exhibition attracted the attention and praise of various circles in the United States. Based on this, the company reached an agreement with the Sino-American Trade Center in New York, Hida Limited, and Bai Li Seafood Products Limited to jointly establish "Wanfengda" Limited in New York City. At the same time, the company, in collaboration with the Bangkok Bank of Thailand, the Mingtai Group Limited of Thailand, and the China Light Industry Products Import and Export Corporation, established the "Chao Thai Trade Development Company" in Bangkok, Thailand, to build a bridge for trade and investment between Shantou and Bangkok. This is the first joint venture established by Shantou in Thailand and is scheduled to open in Bangkok in May. Earlier, the company had already established a joint venture with the China Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corporation and other companies in Harbin to conduct trade with the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and Eastern Europe. Recently, the first batch of barter trade products, the famous Chaozhou tangerines, has been shipped.

Currently, the company has more than 20 wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint ventures, distributed in Shantou, Jieyang, Raoping, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong. These cover various industries such as transportation, electricity, textiles, plastics, light industry, electronics, real estate, tourism, hotels, and trade, with a total investment of over 200 million yuan. It is a well-known group enterprise in the famous hometown of overseas Chinese, Shantou City.
