Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 28th.

Patients in urgent need of hospitalization have to pay an "advance bed fee"; residents who finally get to use gas have to pay a "preliminary gas supply fee"; a middle or high school student attending school in another district has to pay thousands of yuan in "borrowed study fees"… These arbitrary fees and charges, which have long been a source of complaint among the people, are now being addressed in Nanjing.

Recently, the Nanjing Municipal Government conducted a thorough review of the 54 administrative departments under its jurisdiction regarding their fee-collecting practices.

Yesterday, the city officially announced the cancellation of 114 unreasonable fee items, the reduction of 17 excessively high fee standards, and the consolidation of some duplicate fees with similar natures. Additionally, the city standardized the fees for social education and training classes. The "cross-district borrowed study fees," "middle and high school extended class fees," "tutoring class fees," "patient turning fee," "hospital bed fee," "out-of-town vehicle entry permit fee," "South Lake area transit fee," and "gas and liquefied gas transfer fees," among others, are all on the list of canceled fees.

To effectively curb the practice of arbitrary fee collection, the Nanjing Municipal Government also announced that starting now, an approval certificate system will be implemented for administrative and public service fees. Beginning May 1st, all fees will be collected with certificates.

    南京取消不合理收费项目
    据新华社南京３月２８日电  （记者张行端）病人急病住院，要付“提前住院加床费”；居民用上盼望已久的煤气，要交“提前通气费”；一个中小学生跨区上学，要出上千元的“借读费”……这些群众怨声不断的乱摊派、乱收费现象，在南京市开始得到治理。
    南京市政府最近对所属５４个行政主管部门的收费情况进行了清理。
    该市昨天正式宣布：取消１１４项不合理收费项目，降低过高收费标准１７项，合并了一些性质相同、重复收费项目，并统一了社会办学、培训班等的收费标准。群众意见较大的“跨区借读费”、“中小学延长班费”、“补习班费”、“病人翻身费”、“住院加床费”，以及“外地车辆入境通行证费”、“南湖小区过境费”、“两气（煤气、液化气）过户费”等等，都在取消之列。
    为了有效制止乱收费现象，南京市政府还宣布：从现在开始，对行政事业性收费实行许可证制度，并于５月１日起全面实行凭证收费。
