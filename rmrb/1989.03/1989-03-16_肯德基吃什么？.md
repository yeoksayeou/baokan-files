	What Does KFC Serve?
	By Zhu Jianhong, People's Daily

	“KFC's fried chicken has been written about so much by reporters, what else can you write about?” When I walked into the modest and shabby office of Beijing KFC Limited, the public relations department's Ms. He poured a bucket of cold water over my head.

	The U.S. KFC International Company has opened more than 7,700 fried chicken fast-food restaurants worldwide. The sales volume of the Qianmen branch in 1988 topped all other branches globally, attracting batch after batch of reporters to "uncover the secret."

	“Why is KFC so successful? I think everyone feels it a bit, but no one has explained it clearly.” She asked me, “What do these people actually come here to eat?”

	Eating Chicken?

	At the beginning of the year, KFC opened a branch in Dongsi. On the opening day, an elderly woman beamed with joy as she entered the store, saying, “Now it's convenient! I don't have to go all the way to Qianmen anymore!” It turned out that this elderly woman visited the Qianmen fried chicken store every few days, despite her advanced age and the inconvenience of taking the bus, sometimes even hiring a taxi. Why? Just to buy a few pieces of fried chicken. The assistant manager of the Dongsi branch, Ms. Gong, told me that there are indeed some loyal customers like this elderly woman.

	Indeed, KFC's fried chicken has a crispy skin and tender inside. One bite and the mouth is filled with a warm, fragrant aroma. However, if we talk about the art of eating chicken, it's the Chinese who excel. Boiled, roasted, steamed, braised, stir-fried, sautéed, braised, soft-fried, steamed, child-style, beggar-style... there are hundreds of methods, and it's hard to say that American fried chicken stands out. Besides, loyal customers are in the minority. More people are coming for the first time, and some people are not used to the strong fried flavor. It can be said that the attraction is not the "unique good taste" of American "roasted chicken."

	Eating "Fast"?

	Life's pace is speeding up, and some predict that fast food will become a trend. KFC is entering this trend with a fast pace. Isn't there already the saying "KFC leads the new trend in fast food"?

	Eating at KFC is not as complicated as Chinese dining culture. If you wish, you can have a full meal in 15 minutes at KFC. Chicken pieces, bread, accompanied by a side salad and mashed potatoes, consider nutritional matching and are both delicious and economical. There are also canned drinks like cola, beer, and orange juice to choose from. The counter service staff are efficient and quick with serving and collecting payments. The restaurant staff will politely ask, "Are you done?" after you finish your meal and then take away the tray. In this fast-paced atmosphere, the leisurely dining style of "a plate of peanuts, two ounces of baijiu, slowly sipping and savoring" has no place, and customer turnover is naturally fast.

	However, during peak dining hours, it is common to see lines of two or three hundred people waiting outside KFC. When there are many people, the line can even stretch several hundred meters down the street. Fast food can't be eaten quickly. To its left and right, there are many restaurants, food stalls, and even some that are deserted. If it were just for speed, it would be hard to explain why people would rather wait in line here!

	Eating "Style"?

	Eating KFC fried chicken has become a new trend in Beijing.

	Beijing has many fast foods: boxed meals, noodles, buns, dumplings, pancakes, fried dough sticks, and various pastries. However, in people's eyes, these are places for outsiders to patronize. Beijingers, unless absolutely necessary, would not go to these street corners and alleys to show their faces. Eating at KFC, on the other hand, is not only not embarrassing, but it is also quite stylish. Chicken is a genuine American taste, and the restaurant is also American-style: imported tables and chairs are elegant and simple; the lighting is neither too bright nor too dark; the service staff speak softly, smile politely; the walls are adorned with American landscapes and pictures of Colonel Sanders (the founder of KFC) sitting on a green lawn, looking at you with a friendly gaze. Eating American-style food in an American atmosphere gives a strange sense of self-satisfaction. Therefore, KFC is high-class, and young men love to bring their girlfriends here; when relatives and friends come from afar, the host can also invite them to KFC and have a lot of face; Beijingers, who are the most particular about style and gifts, also move their weddings here; and customers who come for birthdays and various commemorative days are even more numerous.

	Of course, Beijing has many high-class and stylish places, but a young lady humorously said, "I also want to try Maxim's (a high-end French restaurant), but can I afford it?" At KFC, a person with a normal appetite can spend as little as seven or eight yuan, or as much as twenty yuan. Outside, there are three price lists hanging, and those who are interested can take a look and know right away, with no fear of being embarrassed. Also, everyone who comes here has a plate, all with the same content. Whether you have a lot of money or a little, whether you are a high official or a commoner, everyone is equal. Unlike other restaurants, where you order exotic delicacies and I order home-cooked dishes, there is inevitably a psychological imbalance. Everyone can afford "KFC," just like in the past when everyone wore military uniforms, and now everyone wears jeans, distinguishing between rich and poor, noble and humble.

	Eating "Name"?

	There are 1,000 customers with 1,000 different situations, but perhaps 500 will say, "I came because of the name." From the beginning of KFC's establishment, the company held a press conference for domestic and foreign reporters to heavily promote it, and also spent $100,000 to rent a communications satellite to broadcast to the world. At the same time, special attention was paid to the trademark—the portrait of Colonel Sanders—promotion, with the white-bearded old man's image printed on the restaurant's exterior walls, glass, tableware, staff uniforms, and name cards, always paying attention to leaving a deep impression on people.

	Since its opening, the company has consistently followed the unified regulations of the U.S. KFC International Company for management, with stable quality and prices. The fame is getting louder and louder, and the number of customers is increasing. Opened for just over a year, "KFC" has already become a famous brand in Beijing.

	The reserved Beijingers' fondness for "KFC" inevitably makes one think of a current consumption trend. Hotels should stay in joint ventures, clothes should be imported, shoes should be imported, electrical appliances, furniture, cosmetics, food... as long as it has a bit of "foreign" flavor, it seems to be particularly favored. The reasons behind this are relatively complex. "KFC" may have benefited from this trend.

	Eating "Culture"?

	What do people eat at KFC? They eat chicken, eat "fast," eat "style," eat "name," it seems to have a bit of each, but it also seems to be a superficial reason. In my opinion, the deeper reason is that they are eating American culture.

	Opening up not only brought investment opportunities for foreign businesses but also brought many opportunities and channels for domestic people to understand and learn about foreign cultures. "KFC," as a symbol of American culture, embodies characteristics such as efficiency, quality, equality, and credibility, providing people with a direct and specific opportunity and occasion to understand American culture. KFC's success among Beijingers has become a symbol: people's unconscious recognition and acceptance of modern qualities such as efficiency and quality. Of course, it also includes some factors that do not need to be absolutely affirmed or denied.

	With the continuation of the opening up, more people will turn their attention to China. Undoubtedly, KFC's current position in the fast-food industry will face challenges from all sides. Who can say that KFC will have everlasting charm? The most direct challenge at present is "KFC" to the Chinese food industry: why does the Chinese food industry, which has so many "chicken" dishes, not have the charm of a "chicken" from across the Atlantic?

### 肯德基吃什么？

　　肯德基吃什么？
    本报记者  朱剑红
    “肯德基炸鸡都快被记者写滥了，你还能写什么东西？”当我走进北京肯德基有限公司那简陋、寒酸的办公室，公共关系部的何小姐给我兜头泼了一盆冷水。
    美国肯德基国际公司在世界各地开了７７００多个炸鸡快餐厅，前门快餐厅的销售额１９８８年居世界各分店之冠，引得一批又一批的记者来这里“探秘”。
    “肯德基到底为什么这么成功？我看大家都感觉到一点儿，但都没说清楚。”她反问我：“你说这些人到底是来吃什么来了？”
    　　　　吃鸡？
    年初，肯德基在东四开了个分店。开张时，一位老太太眉开眼笑地来到店里，连说：“这下好啦！省得我大老远跑前门啦！”原来这位老太太隔三岔五地去一趟前门炸鸡店，一大把年纪还不辞辛苦挤公共汽车，有时甚至花钱雇出租跑一趟。为的什么？就为买几块炸鸡。东四分店经理助理龚小姐告诉我，还真有爱吃的，像老太太这种回头客也有那么一些。
    的确，肯德基炸鸡皮酥里嫩，一口咬下去，热乎乎的满口香气。可是，要论吃鸡吃得绝，还得数中国人，烧、烤、蒸、煮、溜、炒、扒、软炸、汽锅、童子、叫化……名堂不下数百种，怎么也轮不到美国炸鸡来拔尖儿。此外，回头客毕竟占少数，更多的人是初次登门，有些人还很吃不惯炸鸡那股浓郁的起酥油味儿。可以肯定，吸引顾客的绝不是那“独一无二好味道”的美国“烧鸡”。
    　　　　吃“快”？
    生活节奏变快，有人预言，快餐将成潮流。“肯德基”正是以快节奏投入这个潮流，不是很快就有了“肯德基领导快餐新潮流”的说法吗？
    吃“肯德基”，没有中国饮食文化的繁琐。如果你愿意，在肯德基餐厅可以在１５分钟内一饱。鸡块、面包、配以佐餐的沙拉、土豆泥，既考虑营养的搭配，又美味实惠。还有可乐、啤酒、桔汁等罐装饮料供选。柜台服务员配餐、收款熟练利落。餐厅服务员在顾客用完餐时会彬彬有礼地上前问一声：“你用完了吗？”然后把托盘收走。这种快的氛围中，那种“一盘花生米，二两老白干，慢慢酌细细品”的消磨式就餐方式无法立足，顾客的周转自然很快。
    不过，在就餐高峰时期，肯德基快餐厅门口排起二三百人等候是常有的事，人多时甚至排到几百米外的马路上，快餐并不能快吃。在它的左右有不少饭店、餐馆、食品摊，有的冷冷清清，如果仅仅是图快，又很难解释为什么人们宁肯在这儿排队！
    　　　　吃“派”？
    吃肯德基炸鸡成了北京的新时髦。
    北京有不少快餐，盒饭、面条、包子、饺子、煎饼、油条以至各色西点等等。不过，在人们眼里，那是外地人光顾的地方，北京人不到不得已时，是不到那街头巷尾抛头露面。而吃肯德基快餐，不但不丢“份儿”，相反是颇有派头的一桩事。鸡，是地道的美国味儿，餐厅，也是美国味儿：进口的餐桌餐椅古朴雅致；光线既不太亮，又不太暗；服务员软声细语、微笑如仪；墙上挂着美国风光图片、翘腿坐在茵茵绿草上椅座中的山德士上校（肯德基炸鸡创始人）在照片上向你投来亲切的注视。美国气氛中吃美国味儿，有一种莫名其妙的自尊满足感。所以，肯德基够档次，小伙子爱上这里请女朋友的客；家中有亲朋自远方来，主人到肯德基请一桌也很有面子；北京人最讲派儿最挑礼儿的婚宴也移师此处；至于来过生日等各种纪念日的顾客更是多。
    当然，北京城够档次、有派头的地方多的是，不过，一位小姐幽默地说：“马克西姆（一家高级法式餐厅）我也想尝尝，尝得起吗？”到肯德基呢？一个食量正常的人，少则七八元，多则２０元足矣。门外还挂着三块价格表，有意问津者看上几眼便可了然，决无锦囊羞涩之虞。还有，上这儿来的人手一盘，都是一样的内容，钱多钱少，高官百姓，人人平等。不像别的饭店，你点山珍海味，我要家常炒菜，相形之下，心理上难免不平衡。人人吃得起“肯德基”，就像从前人人都穿军装，现在又都穿牛仔服一样，分不清贫富贵贱。
    　　　　吃“名”？
    １０００个顾客有１０００种情况，但也许有５００个会说：“慕名而来”。肯德基建店伊始，公司举行中外记者招待会大力宣传，还花１０万美元租用通讯卫星向世界转播。同时还特别重视商标，——山德士上校头像——的宣传，餐厅外墙上、玻璃上、餐具上，工作人员的服装上、名片上，都印着这个白胡子老头像。处处注意给人留下深刻印象。
    肯德基开业以来，公司一直坚持按美国肯德基国际公司的统一规定进行管理，质量与价格稳定。名气越叫越响，顾客越来越多。开业不过一年有余，“肯德基”已然成为北京的名牌货。
    矜持的北京人对“肯德基”的偏爱不禁使人联想到时下的一种消费倾向。饭店要住合资的，穿衣要穿进口的，买鞋要买舶来的，电器、家具、化妆品、食品……只要沾点“外”的光，似乎格外受青睐。个中缘由，较为复杂。“肯德基”也许沾了这种趋向的光。
    　　　　吃“文化”？
    在肯德基，人们吃到了什么？吃鸡，吃“快”，吃“派”，吃“名”，似乎都有一些，但又好像表层的原因。依我看，深层的，恐怕是吃了美国文化。
    开放，不仅给外商带来了投资机会，也给国内的人们带来了诸多认识、了解外国文化的机会和渠道。“肯德基”作为美国文化的一种形象，体现了效率、质量、平等、信誉等特点，给人们带来一个直接、具体认识美国文化的机会和场合。肯德基在北京人中的成功成为一个象征：人们对效率、质量等现代化品质的一种不自觉的认可和接受。当然还包含着一些并不需要绝对肯定或绝对否定的因素。
    随着开放的继续，会有更多的人把眼光投向中国。无疑，肯德基目前在快餐业的地位将受到各方挑战。谁能说，肯德基会有永久的魅力呢？而目前最直接的则是“肯德基”向中国食品业的挑战：为什么具有这么多的“鸡”的中国食品业，却不如一个来自大西洋彼岸的“鸡”有魅力？
