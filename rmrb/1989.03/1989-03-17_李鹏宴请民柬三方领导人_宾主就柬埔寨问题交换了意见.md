Li Peng Hosts Dinner for Leaders of the Three Cambodian Factions

The host and guests exchanged views on the Cambodian issue in a friendly atmosphere.

New China News Agency, Beijing, March 16 - Premier Li Peng hosted a dinner for Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, and his wife, as well as for Khieu Samphan, Vice-Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea responsible for foreign affairs, and for Son Sann, Prime Minister of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse this evening.

The host and guests exchanged views on the Cambodian issue in a friendly atmosphere.

Li Peng said, "The recent meeting of the leaders of the three Cambodian factions in Beijing, under the leadership of Prince Sihanouk, to discuss the strategy for the struggle against Vietnam, is of great significance."

He added, "We are pleased to see that the resistance forces in Cambodia have further strengthened their unity. This marks the beginning of a new stage in the struggle of the Cambodian people."

Prince Sihanouk said, "The three Cambodian factions have strengthened their unity in military, political, and diplomatic struggles. This unity is based on a common foundation, which is the five-point peace plan proposed by the Democratic Kampuchea and its implementation plan."

He continued, "After the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, we advocate the establishment of a four-party national unity government in Cambodia, not led by any one faction, but jointly administered by the four factions."

Li Peng said, "Prince Sihanouk's proposal for the establishment of a national unity government is excellent. It will not only be supported by the Cambodian people but will also gain the support of the international community."

Mrs. Zhu Lin, wife of Premier Li Peng, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Shucai, and Ambassador Jiang Yulang of the Democratic Kampuchea to China, among others, attended the meeting and dinner.

　　李鹏宴请民柬三方领导人
    宾主就柬埔寨问题交换了意见
    新华社北京３月１６日电  国务院总理李鹏今晚在钓鱼台国宾馆会见并宴请民主柬埔寨主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王和夫人、民柬联合政府总理宋双和负责外交事务的民柬副主席乔森潘。
    宾主在亲切友好的气氛中就柬埔寨问题交换了意见。
    李鹏说，民柬三方领导人在西哈努克亲王领导下最近在北京举行会晤，共商抗越斗争大计，具有重要意义。
    他说，我们感到高兴的是，柬埔寨抵抗力量之间进一步增强了团结。这标志着柬埔寨人民的斗争进入了一个新的阶段。
    西哈努克亲王说，民柬三方在军事、政治、外交斗争中增强了团结。这种团结是有共同基础的，就是民柬提出的五点和平计划和其实施方案。
    他说，“在越南撤军后，我们主张成立柬埔寨四方民族团结政府，不是以任何一派，而是由四派共同主持政府。”
    李鹏说，西哈努克关于建立民族团结政府的主张很好，不仅会得到柬埔寨人民的拥护，也将得到国际社会的支持。
    李鹏总理的夫人朱琳、外交部副部长刘述卿、以及民主柬埔寨驻中国大使江裕朗等参加了会见和宴请。
