The bustling countryside market was filled with the cries of men selling mountain sparrows they had caught. In the foothills of Changbai Mountain in Liaoning Province's Fushun County, sparrows are as common as flies, and passersby paid them no mind.

Lǐ Míng, who had spent years working in the mountains, approached them. He first smiled, then offered them cigarettes, and finally pleaded, "Birds are the natural enemies of forest pests." The bird sellers harrumphed impatiently and continued to hawk their wares.

At 43 years old, Lǐ Míng knew his words carried little weight. He dug into his pockets, haggled down the price, and bought 10 little birds, then released them in front of everyone.

The onlookers shook their heads in bewilderment: What difference does it make if you release a few more birds in our village's wild woods?

Lǐ Míng had no words to respond. He had sent 20 yuan to help save the giant panda, 20 yuan to repair the Great Wall, and 100 yuan for the Great Khingan fire... With his monthly salary of 76 yuan and two children in school, every time he donated money, he had to eat pickled vegetables for days.

Lǐ Míng was the director of the county's forest pest and disease prevention and quarantine station. Though his title sounded impressive, he had no subordinates. Ten years ago, he moved from the county's forestry bureau to the countryside to establish this small station. From then on, the county's 2 million mu of forest pest and disease prevention, monitoring, and treatment work fell on his shoulders. He said, "The Party has given me a job similar to that of a woodpecker."

For a full 10 years, he traversed over 200 villages and 5 forest farms in the county. In all the artificial forests, economic forests, sparse forests, secondary natural forests, shrub forests, and nurseries, he had invested his spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Not to mention the hardships of eating wind and dew, crossing mountains and valleys, every year he organized the release of over 5,000 kilograms of pesticides and disease-preventing drugs. Each year, he saved over 10,000 cubic meters of timber from pest and disease damage, equivalent to a net benefit of over 4 million yuan.

Once, Hai Lang Township experienced a pest outbreak. Lǐ Míng was overwhelmed on the mountain, and just as the pest eradication window was about to close, he didn't have the money to hire people to go into the mountains. In desperation, he ran to a nearby school. The teachers and students, without a word, led a team up the mountain and worked for two days, controlling the pest outbreak.

From then on, he took it upon himself to promote the protection of birds, animals, and forests. He hosted programs like "A Bird a Week" and "Wildlife and Plant Protection" on the county radio station, published the "Forest Pest and Disease Bulletin," and wrote two books, "Beneficial Birds" and "100 Questions on Rodent Control." He also published over 400 popular science articles in more than 30 newspapers and magazines nationwide.

In the vast 2 million mu of forest, Lǐ Míng had not planted many trees. However, whenever the land turned green and the autumn forests were laden with fruit, the locals would remember the song of the "woodpecker" deep in the forest.

　　森林里的“啄木鸟”
    辽宁　李世明
    嘈杂的乡间集市上，几个汉子在高声叫卖捕来的山雀。在长白山余脉的辽宁省抚顺县，山雀满天飞，怎么说也算不上稀有珍禽，行人不屑一顾。
    常年钻山的黎明却凑了过来，先递笑脸，再敬香烟，继而恳谈“鸟是森林害虫的天敌”。卖鸟人不耐烦地哼一声，仍在招揽生意。
    ４３岁的黎明自知人微言轻，只好翻空衣袋，几经还价，买下１０只小鸟，并当众放飞了。
    啧啧，围观的行人大惑不解：在咱村的野林子里，就差你放的这几只鸟？
    黎明无言以对。抢救大熊猫，他寄去２０元；修长城，他寄去２０元；大兴安岭火灾，他寄去１００元……他每月７６元的工资，两个孩子又上学，每次掏钱，他都得啃上几天的咸菜。
    黎明是县森林病虫害防治检疫站的站长。官衔受听，却无一兵一卒。１０年前，他从县林业局到乡下建起了这个小站，从此，全县２００多万亩山林的检疫、测报、病虫害防治工作，就担在了他的肩上。他说：“党给了我一个和啄木鸟类似的差事。”
    整整１０年了，他跑遍了全县２００多个村屯和５个林场，在所有的人工林、经济林、疏林、自然次生林、灌木林、苗圃中，都倾注了他的春秋冬夏。不说餐风露宿、越岭翻山吃了多少苦，每年经他组织施放的灭虫除病药物，就达５０００多公斤。每年在虫口病魔中夺回木材损失１万多立方米，相当于获净效益４００多万元。
    一次，海浪乡发生虫灾。黎明在山上顾东顾不了西，眼看就要错过灭虫时机，他又没有大把的票子雇人进山。万般无奈，他只好跑到附近的学校。师生们二话没说，拉着队伍上山干了两天，控制住了虫灾。
    从此，他把宣传爱鸟、爱兽、爱森林为己任，在县广播站开办了《每周一鸟》、《野生动植物保护》等节目，创办了《林木病虫简报》还出版了《益鸟》、《鼠害防治百问》两本书，并在全国３０多家报刊杂志发表科普作品４００多篇。
    在２００万亩浩翰的森林里，黎明没种过几棵树。然而，每当绿染大地、果满秋林的时候，当地人都会记得林子深处那“啄木鸟”的歌唱。
