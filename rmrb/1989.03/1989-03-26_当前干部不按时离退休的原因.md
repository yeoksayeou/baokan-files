Cadres who have reached a certain age should promptly handle their retirement procedures. This is an institution that the Party and the state have long established. It helps to avoid the aging of the cadre corps and promotes the development of cadre system reform. In recent years, many senior comrades have understood the situation, been open-minded, selfless, and dedicated, and have voluntarily requested retirement. They have taken the lead in abolishing the lifetime cadre system and promoting the process of the "four modernizations" of the cadre corps. However, there are still some cadres who have reached retirement age but are reluctant to step down, occupying positions and affecting the construction of the cadre corps.

Cadres who have reached retirement age are reluctant to step down promptly. Apart from a few who feel that their health is still good and want to continue working for a few more years, the majority of the reasons are:

First, economic factors. According to retired senior cadres, there are no bonuses or allowances after retirement, and salary adjustments do not apply. Fixed salaries and rising prices. Therefore, they want to wait until after the salary reform to retire.

Second, social atmosphere factors. Due to the influence of improper party discipline, some cadres with positions and power drive small cars, live in spacious houses, and have their wives and children well-arranged. They are accustomed to enjoying privileges and naturally do not want to retire; some have not yet arranged for their children and want to use their work convenience to wait for an opportunity to fulfill their wishes before retiring; some, because of poor relations with their superiors, deliberately hold back and refuse to give way.

Third, ineffective measures. Some units do not strictly implement the cadre retirement system and have not put this work on the agenda. They only talk about it verbally and do not dare to take a firm stance. As a result, those who listen retire, while those who drag their feet continue to sit in their positions, and promotions and salary increases are still within the line. As some retired senior cadres say: those who retire are not as good as those who wait, those who wait are not as good as those who drag their feet, and those who drag their feet are not as good as those who cause trouble. This creates a situation where others retire, so I retire; others do not retire, so I do not retire.

### 当前干部不按时离退休的原因

　　当前干部不按时离退休的原因
    干部到了一定年龄，应该及时办理离退休手续，这是党和国家早已规定了的制度。它有利于避免干部队伍老化，有利于推动干部制度改革的发展。几年来，许多老同志深明大义，胸怀坦荡，无私忘我，纷纷恳切请退，用自己的实际行动，带头废除干部职务终身制，带头促进干部队伍“四化”的进程。但是，还有一部分达到离退休年龄的干部迟迟不愿退下来，既占了编制，又影响了干部队伍建设。
    到了离退休年龄的干部不愿及时退下来，除了个别人觉得自己身体尚好，还想继续干几年外，其大多数原因是：
    一、经济方面的因素。据已退下来的老干部反映，现在休息后没奖金，没补贴，调整工资沾不上边；死工资，活物价。因此，想等到工资改革后再退下来。
    二、社会风气的因素。由于党风不正带来的影响，一些有职有权的干部，车子坐得小小的，房子住得宽宽的，老婆孩子安排得好好的，习惯享受特权，固然不肯退下来；还有的子女没有安排完，想利用手中工作之便，等待机会了却心事后再休息；还有的因为与领导关系不融洽，故意憋气不让位。
    三、措施不力的因素。有些单位执行干部离退休制度不严格，没有把这项工作摆上议事日程。只是口头说说，不敢碰硬，结果，“听话”的退了下来，东缠西磨的照常坐“交椅”，调职调级在线内。正如有些退下来的老干部说的那样：退的不如等着看的，看的不如拖的，拖的不如捣蛋的。造成别人退了，我也退，别人不退，我也不退的攀比现象。
