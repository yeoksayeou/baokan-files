The second meeting of the joint commission composed of Angola, Cuba, and South Africa concluded today in Havana, Cuba, reaching an agreement on prisoner exchange.

The meeting, which began on March 20, was held in secret. Representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union attended as observers.

The news release issued at the end of the meeting stated that the prisoner exchange will begin on April 1, 1989. The prisoners include one South African, three Cubans, twelve Angolans, and one Angolan pilot who crashed in Namibia last year.

During the meeting, the representatives discussed the implementation of the three-party agreement signed on December 22, 1988, in New York. The agreement, signed by Angola, Cuba, and South Africa, aims to achieve the independence of Namibia and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.

The release said that this three-party meeting was conducted in a constructive atmosphere. The next meeting will be held in the last week of April in South Africa.

After the meeting, the Cuban and South African delegations held separate press conferences. Cuban spokesman Hidalgo expressed satisfaction with the prisoner exchange agreement, calling it a positive achievement of this three-party meeting. He also announced that since the signing of the New York three-party agreement, 3,230 Cuban soldiers have returned from Angola.

South African spokesman Van Hilderen believed that all parties are fulfilling the agreement. He pointed out, "The entire peace process is proceeding smoothly without major obstacles."

    会议期间，各方代表讨论了有关履行１９８８年１２月２２日在纽约签署的３方协议的事项。由安哥拉、古巴和南非签署的３方协议的目的是实现纳米比亚独立和古巴从安哥拉撤军。
    公报说，这次３方会议是在建设性的气氛中进行的，下一次会议将于４月份的最后一个星期在南非举行。
    会议结束后，古巴和南非代表团分别举行了记者招待会。古巴代表团发言人伊达尔戈指出，古巴对战俘协议的达成表示很满意，认为它是这次３方会议取得的一个积极成果。他还宣布，自从纽约３方协议签署以来，从安哥拉回国的古巴军人已达到３２３０人。
