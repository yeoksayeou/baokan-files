A white fur hat, a white shirt with edged trim, and a beautifully embroidered vest. Around the waist, a blue satin sash. This is the traditional attire of the Tu people. His name is Tong Chengrong. He is the county magistrate of Huizu Tu Autonomous County in Qinghai Province and is 46 years old. He is the sole representative of the 130,000 Tu people in the province.

"What do you plan to discuss as the representative of the Tu people at this meeting?" the reporter asked.

"I have been thinking a lot about agricultural issues," Tong Chengrong said with a thoughtful expression on his weathered face. "Premier Li Peng's report specifically mentioned agricultural issues, which aligns with my thoughts. Without grain, there is no stability." He said, "I won't talk about the changes of the past few years. I just want to discuss the current issue of insufficient agricultural momentum. In our area, fertilizers and pesticides often run out. I often think that instead of investing in a 'scattershot' manner, it would be better for the state to concentrate funds to build large-scale fertilizer and pesticide factories to ensure the needs of agricultural production. There is also an issue that bothers farmers: currently, there are too many grain procurement items, and the prices are not entirely reasonable. Farmers are at a loss, and it is difficult to do the work below."

　　一位土族代表的期待
    本报记者  王谨
    白色的毡帽，带饰边的白衬衫上套着漂亮的绣花坎肩，腰间扎着蓝软缎带子。嗬，地道的土族盛装。他叫童成荣，青海省互助土族自治县县长，今年４６岁。他是全省１３万土族民众中的唯一代表。
    “你代表土族群众来议政，准备在这次会议上讲点什么？”记者问。
    “我考虑比较多的是农业问题。”童成荣黑红的脸上显出沉思的神情。“李鹏总理报告中特别提到农业问题，这与我的想法很对路。无粮不稳。”他说：“这些年的变化就不说了，我只想谈谈目前农业后劲不足的问题，我们那儿化肥、农药经常‘断顿’、脱销。我常想，与其说‘撒糊椒面’式地投资，不如由国家集中资金建一些大型化肥厂、农药厂，以保证农业生产的需要。还有一个引起农民不快的问题，现在粮食征购的项目太多，加之价格定得不尽合理，农民无所适从，下面的工作不好做。”
