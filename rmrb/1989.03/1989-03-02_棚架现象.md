Title: The Shed Phenomenon

The officials of Tongxu County in Henan Province have humorously coined a new term: "shed." The "shed" mentioned in the "Ci Yuan" dictionary refers to "a structure made of bamboo or wood." The "shed" that Tongxu County officials refer to is not a building but a specialized term with rich connotations: any work that has only an empty framework but lacks practical implementation and results is called a "shed." For example, "policy shed" refers to policies that are not implemented.

Several comrades from the Policy Research Office of the Tongxu County Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a month-long investigation into the implementation of rural economic policies in three townships and ten villages in the county. They concluded that "rural policies are seriously shed-like." They cited numerous facts, such as the issue of reducing unreasonable burdens on farmers. From the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council to the provincial and municipal committees and the county committee, there have been repeated orders and specific regulations. However, in the ten villages they investigated, the burden on farmers not only did not decrease but actually increased year by year. For instance, in recent years, various levels of party committees have repeatedly issued directives to improve the contract responsibility system and protect farmers' enthusiasm for production. A few years ago, Tongxu County issued land use certificates to all farmers in the county. This time, upon inspection, it was found that in nine out of the ten villages, the land use certificates were locked in the village office cabinets...

Item after item, decisions have been made, and formal documents have been issued, and in the leaders' work agenda, they have been listed as "completed" items, but in the grassroots level, they have not been implemented or have been implemented very little. This kind of "shed phenomenon" is not unique to rural areas. If you observe carefully around you, it can be seen everywhere in various industries.

Where does the "shed phenomenon" come from? Who should be held responsible for such matters? Of course, one can criticize grassroots cadres in various ways, even to the point of disciplinary action; but those who should be more criticized are probably the higher-level leaders who are negligent in checking and implementing work. Nowadays, many leading organs are very busy. There are endless meetings, reports to be written and conveyed, and a constant stream of comings and goings, making them quite busy. But it seems that many leading cadres have overlooked the most important link: implementing item after item of decisions, supervising and checking, and ensuring effectiveness.

Everything depends on implementation. Any correct decision, if not carried out, is just an empty document, and even worse. This principle is well known. Why do many tasks often get stuck at the implementation stage? The reason is simple: implementation requires leaving the office, facing numerous headaches that were not encountered during the report-making process; the correctness of the decision, the leader's determination and ability, etc., will all be severely tested. Especially for the implementation of some decisions, leading cadres need to lead by example. For example, to govern cleanly and eliminate corruption, one must have great courage and resolutely start with oneself. Just demanding that others implement without including oneself will lose persuasiveness and ultimately lead to the "shedding" of the decision.

A few years ago, a central leader pointed out that we still talk more than we do, and our work is not solid. After a few more years, how much has this shortcoming been overcome? The information from Tongxu County in Henan Province is worth the attention of those who care about the cause of reform.

### 棚架现象

    棚架现象季音
    河南通许农村干部幽默地创造一个新词：“棚架”。《辞源》“棚”字条有段注解：“用竹、木搭成的蓬架或小屋。”通许县干部所说的“棚架”不是指建筑，而是一个有丰富内涵的专用词：凡工作徒有空架子，没有落到实处取得实效的，称为“棚架”。比如说，“政策棚架”，就是指政策没有落实。
    中共通许县委政策研究室有几位同志，到本县3个乡10个村，对落实农村经济政策情况作了一个多月调查，最后得出一个结论：“农村政策严重棚架。”他们列举了许多事实，例如，减轻农民不合理负担问题，上至党中央、国务院，下至省、市委和县委，早已三令五申，并相继作出了具体规定。可是在他们调查的10个村里，农民负担不但没有减轻，反而一年比一年加重。又如，近年间各级党委多次作出部署，要求完善承包责任制，保护农民的生产积极性，几年前通许县为此给全县农民发了土地使用证。这次一查，10个村子竟有9个村的土地使用证被锁在村办公室柜子里……
    一项项早就作出决定，下达了正式文件，在领导工作日程上被列入“已办”的事项，在基层都根本没有办，或者很少办。这类“棚架现象”当然不是农村独有，注意观察一下周围，在各行各业，是到处可以看到的。
    “棚架现象”从何而来？谁应当对这类事负责？当然，可以对基层干部作这样那样的批评，直至处分；但更应当受批评的，恐怕还是对工作疏于检查与落实的上级领导。现在许多领导机关都很忙。没完没了的会议，做不完的报告与传达，加上川流不息的送往迎来，确实忙得不亦乐乎。但看来有不少领导干部忽略了最重要的一环：把一项项的决定付诸实施，督促检查，务求实效。
    凡事贵在落实，任何正确的决定不去实行，不过是一纸空文，甚至更糟。这个道理人所共知。何以许多工作往往就在落实这一关被卡住了？说来原因也简单：落实，就得走出办公室，面对在做报告的时候未曾遇到的令人头疼的众多矛盾；决策是否正确，领导的决心与能力，等等，都将受到严峻的考验。特别是有些决策的落实，需要领导干部身体力行，拿出榜样。比如为政清廉，清除腐败现象，就得拿出极大的勇气，坚决从自己做起。只是要求别人落实，不把自己摆进去，就会失去说服力，最终导致决策的“棚架”。
    一位中央领导同志几年前曾指出过，我们现在还是讲得多，做得少，工作不扎实。又是几年过去了，这个缺点克服了多少？河南通许县传来的信息，值得关心改革大业的人们关注。
