In March, the entire Soviet Union was engulfed in the fervor of electing people's representatives: on the 26th, regional and ethnic regional elections will be held, and various social organizations are convening meetings to select their representatives. In the past one or two months, almost every day in the major newspapers of the Soviet Union, on the front page, you can see reports of candidates meeting with voters and local elections of candidates. Currently, the Soviet Union has selected 8,000 candidates for people's representatives, and through elections, 2,250 representatives will be selected. They will attend the first People's Congress of the Soviet Union as masters.

This election of people's representatives has aroused widespread attention among the Soviet people, igniting the great enthusiasm of the broad masses of voters, because the people's representatives will listen to the people's opinions and act on them. According to the resolution of the 19th Congress of the CPSU, in terms of political reform, the party and the government will be separated. Major policies will be formulated by the party central committee, and party organizations will be freed from daily administrative affairs. The People's Congress is the highest state power organ. According to the Soviet Constitution, major state issues such as the adoption and amendment of the constitution, the formulation of domestic and foreign basic policies, and the approval of national economic and social development plans, will be handled by the People's Congress. The responsibilities of the people's representatives are heavy, so in this election of representatives, voters are very serious and enthusiastic.

The difference between this election of people's representatives in the Soviet Union and past elections is that in the past, it was an equal number of candidates, while this time it is a differential number of candidates. Candidates nominated by the grassroots are not limited, and candidates must be approved by voters at the preliminary election meeting before they can be registered. In the past, when selecting people's representatives, there were regulations on the age, gender, occupation, and other indicators of the representatives. This time, there are none, thus ensuring the freedom of choice for voters. Furthermore, in the past, people's representatives were all pre-selected by various levels of leadership organizations, and voters simply voted. This time is different; it is completely nominated by grassroots unit meetings or a certain number of voters. Therefore, in this election, candidates are no longer selected based on their positions but on their personal achievements and virtues. According to a responsible person from the Soviet Central Election Committee, 1/3 of the mayors of small cities did not become candidates for people's representatives, and two first secretaries of state committees also failed.

Competitive elections are a major feature of this election of people's representatives in the Soviet Union. Preliminary election meetings are held enthusiastically. According to the *Izvestia*, the Smolny district of Leningrad selected 3 candidates from 8. Candidates gave election speeches, and 460 attendees representing 250,000 voters asked the candidates questions from all aspects. Finally, the editor-in-chief of *Nevsky* magazine, Nikolsky, and the famous mathematician and non-party member Fadeyev were selected as candidates. On television, the speeches of candidates and the live situation of voters asking questions were also broadcast. Within various districts, there are often gatherings of people collecting signatures for certain candidates. A responsible person from the Soviet Central Election Committee recently emphasized that the high political activism of the Soviet people is the most outstanding feature of this election movement. The committee received more than 7,000 letters and appeals in the three months of work.

According to the quota allocation, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union selected 100 people's representatives. According to the regulations, the first secretary of the party committee also serves as the chairman of the Soviet. In January, the CPSU Central Committee selected 100 candidates for people's representatives from 207 people proposed by the state party committees and the central committees of the union republics. On March 19, the Soviet newspapers published the names of 12 members and alternate members of the Politburo, including the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Gorbachev, and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Ryzhkov, and the number of votes they received for and against, which is the first time in the history of Soviet elections. During their candidacy period, they traveled to various places to meet with voters and delivered speeches, explaining political and economic reforms from various aspects and expressing their views on issues in the reforms. They all emphasized the role of the party as the vanguard and leading force of society. Voters noticed that some members of the CPSU Politburo and candidates for Soviet people's representatives had their own unique insights when expounding their political views.

On March 26, the entire Soviet Union will hold regional and ethnic regional elections. The elected people's representatives, together with the 2,250 representatives selected by various organizations, will attend the Soviet National People's Congress on April 15. The People's Congress will be able to widely absorb the participation of the masses in state affairs management and move towards a system of self-governance. The Soviet people have fully felt this through the process of electing people's representatives.

　　在苏联选举人民代表的日子里
    方荣萱
    ３月，全苏联卷入选举人民代表的高潮：２６日将举行地区和民族地区的选举，各社会团体纷纷召集会议，要选出这些组织的人民代表。近一两个月来，在苏联各大报纸几乎每天在头版都能看到候选人同选民会见和各地推选候选人的报道。目前，苏联全国已推选出８０００名人民代表候选人，通过竞选将选出２２５０名代表。他们将以主人翁的资格出席苏联首次建立的人民代表大会。
    这次人民代表的选举引起苏联人民普遍的关注，激发了广大选民的极大热情，因为人民代表将广泛听取人民的意见办事。根据苏共第１９次代表会议的决议，在政治改革方面，实行党政分开。大政方针由党中央制定，党组织摆脱日常管理事务。人民代表大会是国家最高权力机构，根据苏联宪法规定，有关国家重大问题，如通过和修改宪法、商定国内外基本方针、批准国家经济和社会发展规划等，将由人民代表大会负责解决。人民代表的责任重大，因此在这次代表的选举中选民十分认真、热情。
    这次苏联人民代表的选举与过去的选举很大的不同点是，过去是等额选举，而这次是差额选举，基层提名候选人不限，候选人必须在预选会上由选民通过才能登记。过去选人民代表，对代表的年龄、性别、职业等指标都有规定，这次完全没有，从而保证了选民自由选择。再有，过去的人民代表都是由各级领导机关事先拟好名单，选民一投票了之。这次不同，完全由基层单位会议或一定数量的选民自由提名。因此，这次选举中，候选人再不是凭职务，而是看个人的实绩和品德。据苏联中央选举委员会负责人透露：１／３的小城市市长未能当上人民代表候选人，两个州的州委第一书记也落选。
    竞选，是这次苏联人民代表选举中的一大特点。预选会开得热烈活跃。据《消息报》报道，列宁格勒斯莫尔尼选区从８名候选人中推选。候选人发表竞选演说，代表２５万名选民的４６０名与会者向竞选者提出各方面的问题。最后，《涅瓦》杂志总编辑尼科利斯基和著名数学家、无党派人士法捷耶夫等３人当选为候选人。在电视中，也播放了竞选人发表演说和选民提问的现场情况。在各选区内，经常有一些人聚集为某候选人征集签名。苏联中央选举委员会负责人最近强调说，苏联人民的高度政治积极性是这次选举运动的最突出的特点，该委员会在工作的３个月里就收到了７０００多封来信和呼吁书。
    根据名额分配，苏联共产党选出了１００名人民代表。按规定，党委第一书记兼任苏维埃主席。１月间苏共中央全会从州党委和加盟共和国党中央提出的２０７人中选出１００名人民代表候选人。３月１９日苏联报刊公布了苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫、政治局委员、部长会议主席雷日科夫等１２名政治局委员、候补委员和中央书记当选，并公布了每个候选人得到的赞成票和反对票，这在苏联选举史上还是第一次。他们在作为候选人期间分赴各地与选民们会见，并发表讲话，从各方面阐述政治、经济改革，并就改革中的问题发表自己的看法。他们都强调了党作为社会的先锋队和领导力量的作用。选民们注意到，有的苏共政治局委员、苏联人民代表候选人在阐述政见时，有自己的独特见解。
    ３月２６日，苏联全国将进行地区和民族地区的选举。选举出的人民代表同各团体组织选出的代表一起共２２５０人，将在４月１５日出席苏联全国人民代表大会。人民代表大会将能广泛吸收人民群众参加国家事务管理，向人民自治的管理体制迈进，苏联人民从人民代表的选举进程中充分体会到这一点。
