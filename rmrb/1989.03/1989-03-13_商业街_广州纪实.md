	Commercial Street
    —A Report from Guangzhou
    Zhang Yongmei

    One end spans the arc over Zhujiang River,
    The other end reaches the Dragon and Phoenix Sports Stadium,
    The ancient vegetable fields transformed into a constellation of carrying poles,
    Guangzhou Road—the broad and long carrying pole.

    Buildings line the road, each displaying its unique charm,
    Like fashion models strutting for a competition,
    Or a colorful parade,
    Forming a lineup to celebrate a festive occasion.

    At night, strings of small suns rise,
    The display windows of department stores are like patches of dawn sky,
    During the day, stars seem to race,
    The decorations of lamps and hardware shine brightly like the Milky Way.

    Walking through this kilometer of commercial competition,
    The blueprints of skyscrapers can become components,
    A kilometer can adorn a century-old bridal chamber,
    A kilometer can attract wealth from all directions.

    A kilometer is a shrunk version of the earth’s expanse,
    Hong Kong, Macau, Southeast Asia, Europe, and America are all vibrant and colorful;
    A kilometer is an unprecedented orchestra,
    Different tunes clash and harmonize in various melodies.

    A kilometer has statues of Guan Yu,
    Electric red candles are offered to legends;
    A kilometer has a bookstore that has sadly closed,
    Fingers only count money, not turn the pages of poetry.

    Commercial Street echoes with the remnants of pastoral songs,
    A few old farmers smoke in the former vegetable fields,
    Leisurely watching cows grazing on the empty land,
    Are they daydreaming about tomorrow or reminiscing about yesterday?

    The bees and butterflies of yesterday no longer come to pick flowers,
    Swallows circle above the rooftops, lost and confused;
    The old farmers, now property owners, say:
    The city should develop, develop.

### 商业街——广州纪实

　　商业街
    ——广州纪实
    张永枚
    一头挑着横跨珠水的长虹，
    一头挑着龙翔凤舞体育馆，
    古老的菜地变成扁担星座，
    广州大道——宽长的扁担。
    群楼在道边各显风姿，
    似时装女郎飘来竞选，
    又如五色盛装的仪仗，
    列成队庆贺节日盛典。
    夜来有成串的小太阳升起，
    百货橱窗是片片朝霞的天，
    白日有颗颗似要奔跑的星，
    灯饰五金的银河眨闪亮眼。
    走过这货殖争妍的一公里，
    摩天楼的蓝图能变成构件，
    一公里能打扮百年的洞房，
    一公里能诱惑四方的财源。
    一公里是缩小的地球宇空，
    港澳东南亚欧美缤纷斑斓；
    一公里是前所未有的乐队，
    不同音调的争鸣各弄管弦。
    一公里有一尊尊关圣帝君，
    通电的红蜡烛向神话奉献；
    一公里有家书店惨然倒闭，
    手指头只数钞票不翻诗篇。
    商业街缭绕着牧歌的余响，
    三两老农在昔日菜地抽烟，
    悠然望着空地吃草的水牛，
    是畅想明日还是回忆昨天？
    昨天的蜂蝶已不再来采花，
    天台上盘旋着迷失的北燕；
    成为房产股东的老农说道：
    城市嘛就应该发展、发展。
