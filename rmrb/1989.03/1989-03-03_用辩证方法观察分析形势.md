	Observing and Analyzing the Situation Using Dialectical Methods
	Secretary of the CPC Zhengzhou Municipal Committee, Cao Lei

	How to deepen the education on the situation? Since the beginning of this year, the CPC Zhengzhou Municipal Committee has proposed to carry out activities of analyzing and discussing the situation among various levels of leading organs and leading cadres, that is, to focus on the hot and puzzling issues that the masses are most concerned about, to link a social phenomenon, to use a basic viewpoint, and to solve a cognitive problem.

	It is necessary to break away from the influence of old ways of thinking

	With the deepening of the reform, many complex situations and problems have emerged in the economic and ideological spheres, which require us to think, analyze, and study them seriously.

	One is the phenomenon of coexistence. In the process of reform, benefits and drawbacks, gains and losses, achievements and problems, progress and imbalance often go hand in hand. Both positive and negative aspects are strongly manifested, developed, and struggled, making it difficult for people to make accurate judgments about these phenomena at times, and even to distinguish between the mainstream and the secondary trends. For example, after the reform and opening up, production has developed, and people's living standards have improved, but some negative phenomena, corruption, and ugly incidents have increased and become more serious compared to the past; the single ownership system has been changed, and individual economies have developed, increasing the effective supply of society, but due to some individual entrepreneurs getting rich, the problem of "unequal distribution" has become prominent, and so on.

	Two is the phenomenon of contrast. Due to various reasons, some people have developed self-contradictory attitudes and behaviors. Many people are confused by this seemingly illogical phenomenon. For example, the overall situation is better than ever before, but people's ideological problems are more than ever before; some people even say that now eating steamed buns is not as delicious as eating steamed buns in the past, but if you say go back to the past to eat steamed buns, they will not agree.

	Three is the phenomenon of diversified cognition. It can be said that almost no reform measure can be supported by everyone at once. Different people can have completely different, even completely opposite, understandings of the same problem. For example, decision-makers often focus on the theoretical proposal of reform, the promotion of reform measures, and the macro effects when observing the situation, while some of the masses often observe and evaluate the situation from the perspective of partial interests and personal benefits: "You say the reform has achieved great results, but why hasn't the amount of vegetables in my basket increased?" When the market price of vegetables rises, citizens, vegetable farmers, and vegetable vendors will have completely different reactions.

	The above-mentioned objective realities are the basic realities we face in carrying out the education on the situation. If we only list some figures and examples, and discuss the situation in a superficial way, while avoiding the real problems and ideological problems that exist in large quantities in life, or not conducting specific analysis, but using the traditional way of thinking, simply summarizing these complex phenomena as "very good" or "very bad," it is obviously not possible to fundamentally solve people's ideological problems.

	The emergence of many contradictions is determined by the times

	The basic characteristics of our times are mainly manifested in two aspects. One is that the whole society is in the midst of great changes, and great changes mean great changes and great development, but at the same time, it is inevitable that there will be great shocks in some aspects. Before the reform, our entire system was "single-patterned," and in the ideological sphere, it was "uniform opinion." Under the single material allocation system, the order in the circulation field was orderly, and the speculators had few opportunities, but economic activities were like a stagnant pool; under the closed-door policy, some negative phenomena were difficult to produce, but the economy was long-term backward, and people's lives were long-term unimproved; in the era of "uniform opinion," the whole country had one voice. During the ten years of turmoil, the economy was on the verge of collapse, but it was still "singing and dancing everywhere." "The situation is very good, not just a little good." In such a political environment, of course, people's complaints were few, but people not speaking did not mean they had nothing to say, and not complaining did not mean they had no complaints. Therefore, now that people's discussions are more, they dare to speak the truth, it is a sign of people's active thinking, enhanced democratic atmosphere, and the progress of democratic politics, a symbol of social progress.

	Another important characteristic of our times is that two systems are in the process of replacing each other. People have many ideological problems and opinions because, in the process of reform, there are indeed many problems objectively. Generally, there are several situations: (1) There are many contradictions and frictions between the old and new systems in many aspects, and some problems are mainly the result of the old system still playing a role. But the conditions for realizing this wish are not yet mature. (2) Problems caused by the new system being imperfect and uncoordinated. (3) Mistakes made due to lack of experience. Reform is a great unprecedented feat, with no ready-made experience to follow, so it is inevitable that there will be mistakes in the work. At present, China's reform has entered the stage of comprehensive development from single breakthroughs and has entered the deep layer from the shallow layer, with greater difficulties and more complex situations, and it is inevitable that problems will arise.

	Another reason why people have many ideological problems and complaints is the problem of cognition itself. One is to use old ideas to look at the new problems that arise in the reform, and the more one looks, the more problems one sees; the other is that the expectations for the reform are too high, and the desire for consumption is too high. Always hoping that one change will bring benefits, and every reform measure will have an immediate effect. Due to the lack of ideological preparation, especially the lack of preparation to pay the price for the reform, so once encountering problems like the rapid rise in prices, doubts and wavering about the reform arise, and even the confidence in the future of the reform is lost.

	Solving the problem of methods and standards for observation and analysis

	We must insist on using dialectical methods to observe the situation. Some people do not use historical and developmental views to look at the problems that arise in the reform, but rather cut off history or blindly compare. In the past, when everyone was drinking porridge, even if there were some ideological problems, as long as a bit of "remembering bitterness and thinking sweetness" was done, it would disappear. Now some people, especially young people, do not like to compare with the pre-reform era. Once they compare vertically, someone will say it's already the 1980s! As if the 1980s should be good in every way, and every desire should be satisfied. Some people do not observe and analyze the situation from a macro perspective, do not specifically analyze the causes of various problems, but attribute all phenomena to the reform, and even raise a series of questions, such as why there was no inflation before the reform? Why are there more corruption phenomena after the reform, and so on.

	We must insist on using the standard of productive forces to observe the situation. Using different standards to observe the situation will lead to different conclusions. Some people judge the situation purely by prices, thinking that stable prices for a long time mean the situation is very good; some judge the overall reform situation by party discipline and social ethics, thinking that the situation is worse now than before, and the more the reform, the worse it gets; some judge by personal feelings. Before the reform, when the majority of people's basic needs were not met, whoever could wear a military coat would feel very proud and satisfied, and their personal feelings would be very good. Now that the distribution gap has widened, the psychological balance that people have long formed is broken, and opinions are more numerous. Using the standard of productive forces to observe the situation, one will find that through reform and opening up, production has developed, the economy has been revitalized, and people's living standards have improved. More importantly, it has ended a closed and stagnant situation and opened up a new historical development period. In this sense, the other problems that appear with the development of productive forces are problems of progress. Of course, we must not ignore these problems, but we must combine the education on the situation with specific actions to solve problems, and make great efforts to solve the problems that the masses are most concerned about in the reform.

	In summary, if we solve the problem of methods and standards for observing the situation, we will be able to correctly judge the situation, have confidence in the future of the reform, correctly deal with and solve some problems that arise in the reform, further boost our spirits, and do a good job in the reform.

    用辩证方法观察分析形势
    中共河南省郑州市委书记　曹磊
    如何将形势教育引向深入？从今年元月开始，中共郑州市委提出在各级领导机关和领导干部中开展对形势的分析、研讨活动，即围绕当前群众议论最多的热点疑点问题，联系一种社会现象，运用一个基本观点，解决一个认识问题。
    必须摆脱旧的思维方式影响
    随着改革的深入，当前在经济领域和思想政治领域出现了许多复杂的情况和问题，需要我们认真地去思考、去分析、去研究。
    一是，共生现象。在改革过程中，利和弊、得和失、成绩和问题、前进和失衡常常相伴而生，而且正反两个方面都在顽强地表现、发展和抗争，以致使人对这些现象的是非曲直一时难以作出准确的判断，甚至难以分清主流和支流，比如，改革开放以后，生产发展了，人民生活提高了，但某些不良现象，腐败现象，丑恶现象比过去多了，严重了；改变了单一的所有制形式，个体经济发展起来以后，增加了社会的有效供给，但由于有些个体户发了大财，“分配不公”的问题也突出了，如此等等。
    二是，反差现象。由于种种原因，一些人产生了自相矛盾的心态和言行。相当多的人又为这种看起来似乎不符合逻辑推理原则的现象所困惑。比如，整个形势比以往任何时候都好，而人们的思想问题又比任何时候都多；有的人甚至说现在吃白蒸馍还不如过去吃窝窝头是味，但你要说再回到过去吃窝窝头的年代，他又不同意了。
    三是，认识多元化现象。可以说几乎没有一项改革措施能一下就被所有人所拥护。对同一个问题在不同人之间可以产生截然不同甚至完全对立的认识，比如决策者往往注重从改革理论的提出、改革措施的推进和宏观的效果等方面看形势，而一些群众则往往从局部利益和个人所得实惠上观察、评价形势：“你说改革成绩很大，我这菜篮子里的东西怎么增加不多？”市场菜价上涨，市民和菜农、菜贩子就会有完全不同的反响。
    以上这些客观存在，就是我们进行形势教育所面对的基本现实。如果仅仅停留在罗列一些数字、举一些典型事例，就事论事地去讲形势如何好、成绩如何大，而对生活中大量存在的现实问题和人们的思想问题采取回避的态度，或者不去进行具体的分析，而是按照传统的思维方式，简单地把这些复杂的现象归结为“好得很”或“糟的很”，显然是不能从根本上解决人们的思想问题的。
    产生诸多矛盾是由时代决定的
    我们这个时代的基本特征突出表现为两个方面。一是整个社会正处在大变革之中，大变革就意味着大变化、大发展，同时也不可避免地会在某些方面出现大的震荡。改革前，我们在整个体制上是“模式单一”，在思想领域是“舆论一律”。在单一的物资统配体制下流通领域秩序井然，倒爷们很少有可乘之机，但经济活动却像死水一潭；在闭关自守情况下，某些消极现象当然难以产生，但经济长期落后，人民生活长期得不到改善；在“舆论一律”的年代，全国上下一个声音。十年动乱期间，经济已经到了崩溃的边缘，还是“到处莺歌燕舞”。“形势大好，不是小好。”在那样的政治环境下，当然人们的议论少、牢骚少，但人们不说话不等于没话说，不发牢骚不等于没有牢骚。所以说，现在人们的议论多，敢讲真话，是人们思想活跃，民主气氛增强、民主政治向前推进的表现，是社会进步的象征。
    我们这个时代的另一个重要特征，就是两种体制正处在交替之中。人们的思想问题多、意见多，是由于在改革过程中，客观上确实存在不少问题，大体分这么几种情况：（一）新旧两种体制在许多方面矛盾多、摩擦多，有些问题的产生主要是旧体制还在起作用的结果。但目前实现这个愿望的条件还不成熟。（二）由于新的体制还不完善、不配套产生的问题。（三）由于缺乏经验而造成的工作上的失误，改革是前无古人的伟大创举，没有现成的经验可循，因而也免不了会出现工作上的失误。在目前的情况下，我国的改革已从单项突破进入到全面展开，由浅层次进入到深层次，难度更大，情况更复杂，出一点问题在所难免。
    人们思想问题多，牢骚多的另一个原因，是认识本身的问题，一是用旧的观念看待改革中出现的新问题，越看问题越多；二是对改革的期望值过高，消费欲望过高。总希望一改就能得到实惠，每一项改革措施都能收到立竿见影的效果。由于缺乏思想准备，特别是缺乏为改革付出代价的思想准备，所以一旦遇到像物价上涨过猛这样的问题，就对改革产生了怀疑、动摇，甚至对改革的前途丧失信心。
    解决观察分析的方法和标准问题
    要坚持用辩证的方法看形势，有的人不是用历史的、发展的观点看待改革中出现的问题，而是割断历史或盲目攀比。过去在大家都喝稀粥的年代，即使有一点思想问题，只要一搞忆苦思甜，就会烟消云散。现在有些人特别是青年人总不喜欢让跟改革前比，一纵向比，有人就会说现在都什么时候了？现在是80年代！似乎80年代就应该什么都好，什么欲望都应该得到满足，还有的不是从全局上观察分析形势，不是去具体地分析出现各类问题的原因，而是把一切现象都归咎于改革，甚至会提出一系列的问题，什么改革前怎么没有通货膨胀？为什么越改腐败现象越多了等等。
    要坚持用生产力标准看形势，用不同的标准观察形势就会得出不同的结论。有人单纯以物价看形势，认为物价长期不动就是形势大好；有的仅仅以党风、社会风气为标准判断整个改革形势，认为今不如昔，越改越糟；还有的以自我感受为标准。改革前，在多数人的温饱问题还没有解决的时候，谁能穿上一件军大衣就感到非常荣耀和满足，自我感觉非常好，现在分配上一拉开差距，人们长期形成的心理平衡就被打破了，意见也就多了。用生产力标准看形势，就会发现通过改革开放，生产发展了，经济搞活了，人民生活提高了。更重要的是，它结束了一个封闭、停滞的局面，开创了一个新的历史发展时期，从这个意义上说，伴随着生产力发展而出现的其它一些问题，都是前进中的问题。当然对这些问题，我们也绝对不可忽视，要把形势教育同解决问题的具体行动结合起来，下大力气去解决改革中出现的群众意见最大的问题。
    总之，观察形势的方法和标准问题解决好了，我们就能正确地判断形势，对改革的前途充满信心，就能正确地对待和解决改革中出现的一些问题，进一步振奋精神，搞好改革。
