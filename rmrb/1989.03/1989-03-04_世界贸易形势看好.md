The global trade situation looks promising. In the past year, global trade has seen a significant rebound, with its growth rate doubling the average rate of the 1980s. The improvement in the global trade situation is evident in the following ways:

First, the growth rate of global trade has been substantial. According to a report released by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on February 28, the global trade volume growth rate increased from 5.5% in 1987 to 8.5% in the previous year. The export value of global commodities in 1987 was $247.995 billion, and in 1988, it was approximately $280 billion. Reviewing the development of global trade since the 1980s, apart from 1984 when the export volume of global commodities reached a high growth rate of 9.5%, 1988 was the year with the fastest growth.

Second, the foreign trade of various countries has seen different degrees of growth. Western developed countries account for more than 60% of the total global trade volume, and their rapid growth in foreign trade played a leading role in the development of global trade in 1988. In the first half of 1988, the export value of commodities from Western developed countries increased by 14.6% compared to the same period in 1987. Affected by the depreciation of the US dollar, the US export in 1988 increased by 26.8% compared to 1987. Despite the appreciation of the yen, Japan's total export value in 1988 reached $264.86 billion, an increase of 15.6% compared to 1987, and the import value reached $187.4 billion, an increase of 25.4% compared to the previous year, both setting historical records. The foreign trade of Western European countries was also active, with the export value in the first half of 1988 increasing by 9% and imports increasing by 10.9% compared to the same period in 1987. In the first nine months of 1988, the export and import of the Federal Republic of Germany increased by 5.6% and 4.7% respectively compared to the same period in the previous year, with the annual export growth rate reaching 5.5%. The foreign trade of developing countries also saw significant growth in the previous year, with the export value in the first five months of 1988 increasing by 17.5% and the import value increasing by 14.4% compared to the same period in 1987. The rapid growth of foreign trade in the "Four Asian Tigers" is particularly noteworthy. Taiwan's export value in 1988 is expected to reach $62 billion, an increase of 15% compared to 1987, with the trade surplus second only to Japan. South Korea's export value in 1988 is expected to reach $56.9 billion, an increase of 20% compared to 1987, and Singapore's export value reached $39 billion, an increase of 30% compared to the previous year. Hong Kong's export value increased by 11%. The total export value of Latin America in the previous year reached $102 billion, surpassing the $100 billion mark for the first time. The foreign trade of OPEC member countries saw limited growth due to the sluggish oil prices.

Third, the trade imbalances between major trading countries have improved. Since the 1980s, the foreign trade of major trading countries has been severely imbalanced, with the US having a huge trade deficit on one hand, and Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, and the "Four Asian Tigers" having large trade surpluses on the other. This situation has exacerbated conflicts between Western industrialized countries, leading to trade frictions and severe fluctuations in financial and foreign exchange markets.

In 1988, the US trade situation improved for the first time since 1980, with the trade deficit decreasing by 19.4% compared to 1987. At the same time, Japan's trade surplus decreased by 2.9% compared to 1987. It is worth noting that the Federal Republic of Germany's trade surplus continued to increase in 1988, with the first nine months of the year seeing an increase of 8.7% compared to the same period in 1987, reaching 90.9 billion marks.

Fourth, the development of the global economy has promoted trade growth. According to a report released by the United Nations at the beginning of this year, the global economic growth rate in 1988 was 4%, higher than any year since 1984. The US economic growth rate was 3.8%, while Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany had growth rates of 5.8% and 3% respectively. At the same time, their economic indicators showed some characteristics of an economic cycle upswing, with fixed capital investment and private consumption increasing, high enterprise operating rates, rapid industrial production growth, rising global stock markets and interest rates, active markets, and increased employment. These developments can largely be attributed to the expansionary fiscal and monetary policies adopted by Western countries to prevent the negative impact of stock market crashes on economic and trade development. The growth of the global economy has stimulated increased demand for commodities in the global market, promoting the expansion of global commodity supply.

Fifth, the trend of trade bloc formation and regionalization has become more pronounced. Facing the pressure of trade protectionism from the US and Europe, intra-regional trade in Asia increased significantly in 1988. Trade between Japan, the "Four Asian Tigers," ASEAN countries, and mainland China has become closer, and trade relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have also strengthened. Asia may become a new global economic center to rival Europe and the US. In 1988, the acceleration of the European Community's efforts to build a unified large market and the signing of the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement had a positive impact on the economic and trade development of the relevant regions, but also caused concern in other regions and countries. As a component of global economic integration, the trend of bloc formation and regionalization in global trade can promote the development of global trade, but it obviously has a certain exclusivity towards other regions.

Looking ahead to 1989, the global economic situation remains promising. The number of orders, fixed capital investment, and private consumption held by enterprises in the US and Western European countries continue to show an upward trend. The favorable factors that drove the growth of global trade in 1988, such as the easing of the international situation, the adjustment of trade imbalances, economic adjustments and reforms on a global scale, technological progress, and the trend of trade bloc formation and regionalization, will continue to play a role this year. If the inflation rates of major industrialized countries in the world and the rise in global commodity prices are kept at a relatively low level in the current year, global trade will continue to grow. The European Economic magazine hosted by the European Community predicts that the global trade volume will grow by 6% in 1989. However, there are also some unfavorable factors in the development of global trade, such as trade protectionism and the possibility of a rapid rise in global commodity prices. In the context of global trade development, most developing countries, due to the impact of an unfair international economic order, remain in a disadvantageous position, especially facing the pressure of trade bloc formation and regionalization, it is even more necessary to strengthen South-South cooperation.

　　世界贸易形势看好
    童书兴
    在刚刚过去的一年中，世界贸易显著回升，其增长速度为８０年代以来平均速度的一倍。世界贸易形势的好转表现为：
    一、世界贸易增长幅度较大。据关税及贸易总协定２月２８日发表的报告，去年世界贸易量增长率从１９８７年的５．５％增至８．５％，１９８７年世界商品的出口额为２４７９９．５亿美元，１９８８年按年率计算约为２８０００亿美元。回顾８０年代以来世界贸易的发展，除１９８４年世界商品的出口量达到９．５％的高增长率以外，１９８８年是增长最快的年份。
    二、各国的对外贸易都有不同程度的增长。西方发达国家贸易额占世界贸易总额的６０％以上，它们外贸的迅速增长对１９８８年世界贸易的发展起主导作用。１９８８年上半年，西方发达国家的商品出口值比１９８７年同期增长１４．６％。受美元汇率下浮的影响，美国１９８８年出口比１９８７年上升２６．８％。尽管受到日元升值的影响，日本１９８８年全年的出口额仍达到２６４８．６亿美元，比１９８７年增长１５．６％，进口额达到１８７４亿美元，比前年增长２５．４％，进出口总额均创历史最高纪录。西欧各国的对外贸易也较活跃，１９８８年上半年出口额比１９８７年同期增长９％，进口增长１０．９％。联邦德国１９８８年头９个月出口和进口分别比前年同期增长５．６％和４．７％，全年出口增长５．５％。发展中国家的对外贸易去年也有较大增长，出口额１９８８年１—５月比１９８７年同期增长１７．５％，进口额增长１４．４％。亚洲“四小”外贸增长之迅速，引人注目。我国台湾１９８８年的出口额可望达到６２０亿美元，比１９８７年增长１５％，贸易顺差额之大仅次于日本。南朝鲜１９８８年的出口额可达到５６９亿美元，比１９８７年增长２０％，新加坡的出口额达到３９０亿美元，比前年增长３０％。香港出口额增长１１％。去年拉美地区的出口总额达到１０２０亿美元，首次突破１０００亿美元的大关。欧佩克成员国的对外贸易因石油价格疲软增幅不大。
    三、各主要贸易国之间贸易失衡有所改善。８０年代以来世界主要贸易国的外贸严重失衡，一方面美国存在巨额贸易逆差，另一方面日本、联邦德国，以及亚洲“四小”有大量贸易顺差。这种情况加剧了西方工业国家之间的矛盾，导致贸易摩擦和金融、外汇市场的剧烈动荡。
    １９８８年，美国的外贸状况自１９８０年以来第一次有所改善，贸易逆差比１９８７年减少１９．４％。与此同时，日本外贸顺差比１９８７年减少２．９％。值得注意的是，联邦德国的贸易顺差在１９８８年继续增加，仅１９８８年头９个月就比１９８７年同期增加８．７％，达到９０９亿马克。
    四、世界经济的发展促进了贸易发展。据联合国今年年初发表的世界经济年度报告称，１９８８年世界经济增长率为４％，比１９８４年以来任何年份都高。美国经济增长率为３．８％，日本和联邦德国分别为５．８％和３％。同时它们的经济指标具有经济周期高涨的某些特征，固定资本投资和私人消费都在增长，企业的开工率很高，工业生产增长较快，世界股市和利率回升，市场活跃，就业有所增加。这些在很大程度上应当归结于西方国家为防止股市暴跌对经济、贸易发展产生的不利影响所采取的扩张性财政、货币措施。世界经济的增长刺激着世界市场商品需求的增加，促进了世界商品供应的扩大。
    五、贸易集团化和地区化趋势得到明显加强。面对着美、欧贸易保护主义的压力，１９８８年亚洲地区内部贸易大幅度增加，日本、“四小”、东盟国家及中国大陆之间的贸易更加紧密，上述国家和地区与苏联东部的贸易关系也在加强。亚洲可能成为与欧、美抗衡的新的世界经济中心。１９８８年欧洲共同体加快筹建统一大市场工作以及美加自由贸易协定的签署，均对有关地区的经济、贸易发展产生有利影响，同时也引起世界其它地区和国家的不安。世界贸易中的集团化和地区化倾向作为世界经济一体化的构成部分，能够促进世界贸易的发展，但它显然对其他地区又具有一定的排他性。
    展望１９８９年，世界经济形势仍然看好。美国和西欧国家企业手中的订单数量、固定资本投资和私人消费仍呈增长的趋势。促使１９８８年世界贸易增长的其他有利因素诸如国际局势缓和、贸易失衡的调整、世界范围的经济调整和改革、科技进步、贸易的集团化地区化趋势等仍将在今年继续发挥作用。如果今年世界各主要工业国的通货膨胀和世界商品价格上涨保持在较低的水平上，世界贸易仍将继续增长。欧共体主办的《欧洲经济》杂志预测，１９８９年世界贸易量将增长６％。但是在世界贸易发展当中也存在一些不利因素，诸如贸易保护主义、世界商品价格有上涨过快的可能等。在世界贸易发展的形势下，大多数发展中国家因受到不合理的国际经济秩序的影响仍处于不利的地位，特别是面对贸易集团化和地区化的压力，更有必要加强南南合作。
