The New China News Agency, New York, March 3rd: According to a spokesman for the United Nations, Iranian officials and United Nations officials held four meetings on the 2nd and 3rd of this month to prepare for the next round of direct talks between the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq, scheduled for later this month.

Participants in these four meetings included Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hussein Rawasani and the personal representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Jan Eliasson, along with other United Nations officials.

The details of the talks have not been disclosed, but it is speculated that the main topics of discussion were the date and location of the next round of direct talks between the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq.
