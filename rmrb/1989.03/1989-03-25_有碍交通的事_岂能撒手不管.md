Title: Issues Hindering Traffic Cannot Be Ignored

Last summer, at the intersection of Renmin Road in Xianyang, Shaanxi, and the West (Xi'an) to Baoji (Baoji) Highway, a certain unit dug a trench approximately two meters deep and three meters wide. Almost a year has passed, and there are still no signs of laying pipes, burying wires, filling the trench, or repairing the road.

This is a critical traffic artery, with frequent passing vehicles. Drivers often have to drive cautiously, skirting the edge of the trench. At night, there are no traffic lights or signals, and an accident can easily occur. Drivers and pedestrians are all complaining.

Who knows which unit is responsible for this project, and why did they dig up the road and then ignore it? Why haven't the relevant municipal and traffic departments taken any action? Can we just let this "roadblock trench" continue to obstruct the highway like this!

### 有碍交通的事　岂能撒手不管

　　有碍交通的事　岂能撒手不管
    去年夏天，在陕西咸阳市人民路和西（安）宝（鸡）公路连接处，某单位挖了一条深约二米、宽近三米的沟，至今快一年了。沟里存满积水，却不见铺管、埋线、填沟、修路的迹象。
    这是一段交通咽喉地带，过往车辆频繁，驾驶员常常提心吊胆地开车从沟边擦过。到了晚上，这里又没设置灯光信号，一不小心，就会发生意外，驾驶员和行人更是叫苦不迭。
    不知这是谁家搞的什么工程，为什么挖开了马路就不再过问了？有关市政、交通部门又为何不予追究？难道睁着眼让这条“拦路沟”就这样在公路上继续横躺下去！
