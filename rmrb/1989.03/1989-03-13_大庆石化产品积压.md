According to a report from the *China Petrochemical News*, petrochemical products, which were once in high demand, are now piling up at the Daqing Petrochemical Company. The company has 20,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, paraffin, and acrylic fibers that have been sitting in warehouses since the beginning of the year. Notably, 2,000 tons of high-quality fertilizers urgently needed for agricultural use are stored outdoors. If it rains or snows, the potential loss would be significant. It is understood that the main reasons for this situation are poor coordination among intermediate links and insufficient railway transportation capacity. Additionally, purchasing units are facing financial shortages.

　　大庆石化产品积压
    本报讯  据《中国石化报》报道：一向紧俏的石化产品，而今在大庆石化总厂积压。这个厂今年生产的２万吨化肥、石蜡、腈纶丝一直在仓库里沉睡，尤其是２０００吨农业战线急需的优质化肥存放在露天里，一旦遇到雨雪，损失不可设想。据了解，造成上述问题主要是中间环节协调不力，以及铁路运力不足；其次是购货单位资金短缺。
