Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, March 22nd.

A United Nations spokesperson announced today that UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar will hold another round of consultations with officials from Iraq and Iran at the end of this month and the beginning of next month to prepare for the resumption of direct talks between the foreign ministers of the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, March 22nd.

Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati recently wrote to the UN Secretary-General, stating that Iran rejects Iraq's proposal to exchange 100,000 prisoners of war unless Iraq withdraws its troops to the internationally recognized border.

In his letter, Velayati also accused Iraq of attempting to amend the ceasefire plan passed by the UN Security Council in 1987 to keep its troops stationed on Iranian territory.

He said that as long as Iraq refuses to take concrete measures on important issues such as troop withdrawal, any new proposals from Iraq will not be accepted by Iran.

The Iranian side claims that Iraqi forces are still occupying 2,663 square kilometers of Iranian territory. However, UN experts estimate that the area of Iranian territory under occupation is approximately 1,000 square kilometers.

　　德奎利亚尔致力恢复两伊谈判        
    伊朗拒绝伊拉克交换战俘建议
    新华社联合国３月２２日电  一位联合国发言人今天宣布，联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔将在本月底、下月初同伊拉克和伊朗官员举行另一轮磋商，为恢复两伊外长直接谈判做准备。
    新华社联合国３月２２日电　伊朗外长韦拉亚提日前致函联合国秘书长，表示伊朗拒绝伊拉克关于交换１０万名战俘的要求，除非伊拉克将其部队撤至国际公认的边界线以内。
    韦拉亚提在信中还指责伊拉克企图修改联合国安理会１９８７年通过的两伊停战计划，以使其部队继续驻扎在伊朗领土上。
    他说，只要伊拉克在撤军等重要问题上拒绝采取具体措施，那么它的任何新建议都将不会被伊朗接受。
    伊朗方面声称，伊拉克军队目前仍占领着伊朗２６６３平方公里的领土。但据联合国专家估计，伊朗被占领土的面积大约为１０００平方公里。
