The Trouble of Naming

The Toyota Motor Corporation's U.S. division recently named a new, expensive model of car "LEXUS," hoping that customers would associate the name with "LUXURY" (meaning luxurious and comfortable in English). However, things did not go as planned. After Toyota adopted this name, it sparked a lawsuit, forcing the company to go to court. In mid-January, a federal judge in New York ruled: because "LEXUS" is too similar to the name of the legal consulting firm "LEXIS" owned by the Mead Corporation in Ohio, Toyota must abandon this name, otherwise, it will have to pay compensation to cover the loss of Mead Corporation's trademark value.

It seems that Toyota is reluctant to give up the "LEXUS" trademark because the company has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing and promoting the LEXUS car. Changing the name now would result in significant losses, and finding a new suitable name is not easy. If Toyota cannot win the lawsuit, it will have to pay compensation.

An American corporate identity consultant, Siegel, said that with the increase in new products and companies, there are fewer and fewer easy-to-remember and unregistered words available for trademarks.

　　取名的苦恼
    设在美国的日本丰田汽车分公司最近给一种价格昂贵的新款式汽车取名ＬＥＸＵＳ，希望顾客听到这个名字，能联想起ＬＵＸＵＲＹ（豪华、舒适的意思）这个英文字。不料事与愿违，丰田起用这个名字后，却惹起了一场官司，被迫对簿公堂。１月中旬，纽约一位联邦法官裁决：由于ＬＥＸＵＳ同美国俄亥俄州米德公司所属的法律咨询公司ＬＥＸＩＳ的名字太相近，因此，丰田公司必须放弃这个名字，否则就要支付一笔赔偿费，以补偿米德公司商标价值的损失。
    看来，丰田公司不肯放弃ＬＥＸＵＳ这一商标名称，因为该公司已经花费了数百万美元来开发和推销ＬＥＸＵＳ汽车，现在改名损失太大，而且另求佳名也非易事。丰田公司如不能胜拆，就只好作出赔偿了。
    美国一位企业识别顾问西格尔说，新产品与公司激增后，人们易记上口并尚末登记成为商标的词所剩无几了。
