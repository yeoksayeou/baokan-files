An American patient who relies on an artificial heart device to sustain life has lived for 83 days, becoming the longest-living patient in the United States to be maintained by such a device.

The patient, named Jack Fisher, is 43 years old and is currently hospitalized in a Pittsburgh hospital. He is now entirely dependent on the artificial heart device to keep him alive while waiting for a human heart donation.

The device, known as the "Novacor" artificial heart, is placed in the lower part of Fisher's abdomen and is powered by an external electrical source. This device can replace 85% of the heart's functions.

    美一病人靠人工心脏已维持生命八十三天
    新华社纽约2月28日电美国一位靠人工心脏装置维持生命的病人迄今已活了83天，成为美国靠人工装置维持生命最长的病人。
    这位名叫杰克·费希尔的病人今年43岁，目前住在匹兹堡一家医院里。他现在完全靠人工心脏装置维持生命，以等待有人捐献心脏。
    这一称做“诺瓦科”的人工心脏装置被安放在费希尔的胃的下部，靠与体外连接的电力驱动。这种装置可代替心脏85％的功能。
