The cold wind has begun to blow, but the cicadas still sing proudly, unaware of the approaching winter, often becoming the pitiful and laughable figures in fables. In today's world, there are also many "cicada-like" figures with impaired judgment, and Nguyen Co Thach, the Vietnamese Foreign Minister, is one of them.

Recently, Nguyen Co Thach visited Thailand, but due to his insistence on old conditions for withdrawal, he returned empty-handed. However, at the end of his visit, he boasted without restraint: that regardless of whether the Cambodian issue is resolved or not, Hanoi will continue with economic reforms. The implication is that although Vietnam insists on not withdrawing its troops, its domestic economy is on the right track and heading towards prosperity. Nguyen Co Thach, though cunning, has shown no wisdom in this declaration.

It is well known that Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia for 10 years has not only caused Cambodia to suffer from the ravages of war, but Vietnam itself has also experienced economic stagnation, financial exhaustion, and widespread public discontent. "Prolonged military campaigns deplete national resources." This aptly describes Vietnam's situation. At the same time, the international community, including Western Europe, North America, and Japan, has repeatedly stated that Vietnam will not receive funds or aid unless it withdraws its troops. Vietnam's internal resources are depleted, and external aid is tight, making economic reforms an illusion. Is there any country in the world that can develop its economy while engaging in prolonged military conflicts?

Vietnam's economic difficulties are closely related to its invasion of Cambodia. To develop the economy, the Cambodian issue must be resolved first. Otherwise, any self-congratulation will be as futile as the cicada's self-deception.

　　自欺欺人
    冷风吹起来了，秋蝉还要自鸣得意地唱个不停，不知冬之将至，使它常常成为寓言中可怜又可笑的角色。在今日世界上，也不乏理智不健全的“蝉”式人物，越南外长阮基石可算是其中一个。
    近日，阮基石访问泰国，由于坚持撤军条件的老调儿，弄得两手空空而返。可是他在访问结束时，却自鸣得意起来，漫无边际地胡吹一通：什么无论柬埔寨问题解决不解决，河内都将继续进行经济改革。那言外之意，越南虽然顶着不撤军，可国内经济却正步入正轨、走向繁荣。阮基石虽属老谋深算，可这一通表白无高明之处。
    众所周知，越南侵柬１０年，不仅使柬埔寨饱受战祸，越南本身也是经济萎缩、国用枯竭、民怨沸腾。“久暴师则国用不足。”用在越南，恰如其分。同时，国际社会，包括西欧、北美、日本也都多次表示，越南不撤军，不提供资金，不提供援助。越南内源空虚、外援紧张，经济改革不过是空中楼阁。世界上有在穷兵黩武中发展经济的国家吗？
    越南的经济困难与侵柬紧密相关，发展经济首先要解决柬埔寨问题。否则，任何自鸣得意，也只能是秋蝉那样自欺欺人罢了。
