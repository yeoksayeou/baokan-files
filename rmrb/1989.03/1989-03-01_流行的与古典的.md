According to the "Yue Ji" (Records of Music), during the early Warring States period, Wei Wen Hou once told Confucius' student Zi Xia, "When I wear my formal cap and listen to ancient music, I am afraid I might fall asleep, but when I listen to the music of Zheng and Wei, I do not feel tired." Here, "ancient music" refers to the elegant music of ancient times, such as the "Shao" and "Wu"; "the music of Zheng and Wei" refers to the popular folk music of that time, which was probably similar to the songs and music sung by men and women during their romantic encounters in the mulberry and willow groves. This Wei Wen Hou was quite honest and lovable, as he did not hide his preference for "popular" music over "classical" music in front of scholars.

Confucius, on the other hand, had a special fondness for ancient music. After appreciating the "perfect and beautiful" music of "Shao," he was so moved that he "did not taste meat for three months." He was extremely displeased with the music of Zheng and Wei, saying, "I dislike the disorder that the music of Zheng brings to elegant music." Later, Xunzi and the "Yue Ji" also criticized the music of Zheng and Wei as "making people's hearts lustful" and "music of a chaotic age." Since there was no recording technology in ancient times, the sound effects of this "music of a chaotic age" are unknown. However, the lyrics of the music of Zheng and Wei have been preserved. It is said that among the 300 poems edited by Confucius, the "Zheng" and "Wei" sections together have 60 poems, accounting for about 1/5 of the entire book. According to Zhu Xi's statistics, there are still about 20-30 poems about "adultery and elopement." This shows that Confucius was quite tolerant of the music of Zheng and Wei and did not completely judge its value based on his personal likes and dislikes.

Human nature tends to "like novelty and dislike old things," which leads to endless changes in art. This can be seen in the history of drama. In the Yuan Dynasty, the northern tunes were prominent, but by the mid-Ming Dynasty, the southern tunes of the Haiyan style had become popular, and the northern tunes gradually declined. By the Jiaqing period, the folk gradually replaced the Haiyan tunes with the Kunshan tunes. When the Kunshan tunes first emerged, they were only popular among the folk singers and had not yet entered the grand halls of the wealthy. However, by the Qing Dynasty during the Qianlong reign, they had completely become ancient and elegant "Ya Bu," and listeners "could not help but be confused and not know what it was about" (as quoted by Jiao Xun). The "Hua Bu" local tunes that gradually emerged in the folk, "even children could understand," were deeply welcomed by the people. The Ming Dynasty drama theorist Wang Jide once said, "The tunes of the world change every thirty years." This is not an empty statement.

All this is not surprising. Popular art is always the result of social psychological stimulation. At a specific time, it appears to be simple and easy to understand, and it naturally resonates with the emotions of the people, making it easily accepted and loved by the masses of that time. Classical art, on the other hand, is a product of a past era. The original state of the collective psychology at the time of its prosperity no longer exists, and with the passage of time, these arts become increasingly elegant and even profound. This sense of distance often makes ordinary people who have not received specialized training feel unfamiliar and unsatisfied. As early as the Qing Dynasty, Li Yu pointed out: "Performing ancient plays is like singing Qing Qu, it can only please the ears of a few connoisseurs, and cannot entertain the eyes of the guests in the hall." Therefore, whatever is popular is always the majority's, and whatever is classical is always the minority's. For a collective art like drama, which requires the cooperation of many people, it is naturally easy to tend towards popularization and trendiness.

However, due to the rapid changes in social psychology, new popular arts are constantly being introduced to replace old popular arts. Thus, "popularity" inevitably has the characteristic of "transience." Classical art is different. It has undergone two kinds of selection, "of the times" and "historical," and thus becomes an art that can be preserved for a long time. If a certain popular art can still be popular after being selected for ten, a hundred, or even more years, then this small number of works that have been passed down have become "classical." Just as the folk songs that were once popular in the mulberry and willow groves have been passed down to this day and have become deep and profound "classical" representatives of an era. From this perspective, whatever is popular is always transient, and whatever is classical is always enduring. Because of this, many dramatists are keen to make unremitting efforts to recreate classical dramas, making them appear in new forms to audiences of each era. "Popular" stimulates artistic innovation, and "classical" affirms artistic inheritance. The former promotes the fission, recombination, and renewal of artistic types and forms, while the latter maintains the "ecological balance" of the entire artistic world, allowing the artistic essence of history to be passed down from generation to generation, preserving many choices for future generations.

There are also many intersecting phenomena. For example, while pursuing fashion, one revives the classics; while promoting tradition, one inspires innovation; the classics borrow new trends to spread widely, and the popular borrows tradition to go even further, and so on. Take, for example, the re-performance of Shakespeare's plays four hundred years ago. In today's world, there is Shakespeare speaking ancient English, and there is Shakespeare speaking modern Chinese; there is a retro-style Shakespeare that pursues the original Globe Theatre, and there is a avant-garde Shakespeare with jazz accompaniment; there is Shakespeare in Japanese kimono, and there is Shakespeare in Chinese opera costumes.

　　流行的与古典的
    叶长海
    据《乐记》载，战国初魏文侯曾对孔子学生子夏说：“吾端冕而听古乐则唯恐卧，听郑卫之音则不知倦。”这里的“古乐”，指的是上古的《韶》《武》等雅乐；“郑卫之音”，是指当时流行的民间“新乐”，大概与桑间濮上男女幽会求爱的歌乐相类。这位魏文侯也还老实得可爱，在雅士面前，并不隐瞒自己爱听“流行的”而不爱听“古典的”的俗趣。
    孔子则特别钟爱古乐，他欣赏“尽善尽美”的《韶》乐后，竟“三月不知肉味”。对于郑卫之音他极为反感，所谓“恶郑声之乱雅乐也。”而后荀子和《乐记》也把郑卫之音贬为“使人心淫”和“乱世之音”。古时没有录音技术，这种“乱世之音”的音响效果究竟如何，不得而知。但郑卫之音的歌词文字却传留不少。相传经孔子删订过的诗三百篇中，《郑》风《卫》风共计６０篇，约占全书１／５。按照朱熹所统计，其中“淫奔”之诗还有二三十篇。足见孔夫子对郑卫之风也还相当宽容，并不完全以个人好恶而定取舍。
    人心之“喜新厌旧”，引起艺术无休止的变化。考之于戏剧史，就足以为证。戏曲声腔于元代重北曲，明代中期则已盛行南曲系统的海盐腔，北曲渐趋式微。至嘉靖间民间又渐渐以昆山腔取代了海盐腔。昆山腔方兴起时，也只流播于民间歌儿之口，并未登富贵之家的大雅之堂，但到了清代乾隆年间就完全成为古奥的“雅部”，听者“无不茫然不知所谓”（焦徇语）。而逐渐兴起于民间的“花部”诸地方声腔剧种，“虽妇孺亦能解”，也就深受百姓欢迎。明代戏曲理论家王骥德曾称：“世之腔调，每三十年一变”。当非虚妄之论。
    这一切说怪不怪。凡流行艺术，总是社会心理刺激的结果，在特定的时间里，显得通俗易懂，与众人情趣相合，自然易于为当时民众所接受所喜爱。古典艺术则是过去某个时代的产物，在它兴盛时的那种群众心理原状已不复存在，加以时间的距离，这些艺术愈来愈显得典雅甚或艰深。这种距离感常使未受专门训练的一般人感到不亲切不解渴。清初的李笠翁就已点明：“演古戏如唱清曲，只可悦知音数人之耳，不能娱满座宾朋之目。”故而，凡是流行的，总是多数人的，凡是古典的，总是少数人的。像戏剧这样的群体性艺术，需要许多人的合作，自然容易倾向通俗化、流行化。
    但是，由于变化的社会心理又总是迅速地推出新的流行艺术以取代旧的流行艺术，于是“流行性”也就不可避免地兼有“短暂性”。古典艺术则不然。它曾经过“时代的”和“历史的”两种选择，因而就成为一种可以长期保留的艺术。如果“流行的”某种艺术品经过十年、百年甚至更长的时间遴选依然流行于世，那么这少量传世之作就已变成“古典的”了。就如当年流行于桑间濮上的俗唱，流传于今都已成了代表一个时代的深奥的“古典”。从这个角度看，凡是流行的，总是短暂的，凡是古典的，总是长存的。惟其如此，也就有不少戏剧家喜欢不遗余力地对古典戏剧进行再创造，使之不断地以新面貌出现于各个时代的观众之前。“流行的”刺激了艺术的创新，“古典的”肯定了艺术的传承。前者促使艺术类型形态的裂变、重组与更新，后者则维护了整个艺术世界的“生态平衡”，让历史的艺术精华代代相传，为后人保留了许多选择的机会。
    更有许多交叉的现象。如：在追求时尚时却复活了古典，在弘扬传统时却启发了创新，古典的借新潮得以广为传播，流行的借传统反而行之弥远，等等。且以四百年前莎士比亚戏剧的重演为例。在今天的世界上，有说古代英语的莎士比亚，也有说现代汉语的莎士比亚；有追寻当年环球剧场样态的复旧式的莎士比亚，也有爵士乐伴唱的先锋派的莎士比亚；有穿着日本和服的莎士比亚，也有穿着中国戏装的莎士比亚……
