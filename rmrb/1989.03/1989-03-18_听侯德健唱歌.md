At popular song concerts in Beijing, it is often heard that a minority of the audience shouts at the singers, "Get off the stage! Get off the stage!" Newspapers have published many articles criticizing such uncivilized behavior, and the performance organizers have repeatedly announced the "Audience Guidelines" in the theater. However, the effect seems to be minimal. Some "experts" have come out to explain: This is a form of emotional release for modern audiences. They come to the theater to spend money, half to listen to songs, and half to release their emotions, or even more to release their emotions, and there is no need to criticize them.

However, for the singers, this is always a spoiler. For the majority of the audience, such shouting is also hard to accept. Every time such a situation occurs, seeing the singers facing the shouts of "Get off the stage! Get off the stage!" (even if it is only a minority), standing calmly in the center of the stage, and picking up the microphone, I admire their on-stage courage.

Recently, Hou Dejian, who has been absent from the Beijing music scene for several years, suddenly appeared on stage. How did he deal with the shouts of "Get off the stage!"?—He presented the audience with a new song, "Get Off the Stage":

Get off the stage, my nerves are already weakening;
Get off the stage, this stage seems no longer to belong to me.
Get off the stage, yesterday you were still cheering for me;
Get off the stage, but today why do you hate me so much.
Get off the stage, actually, none of us have made any big mistakes;
Get off the stage, why do you hate him, he hates you, and you hate me.
...

The audience was first taken aback, then realized, and thus the following scene unfolded: Under Hou Dejian's direction, the entire audience sang "Get off the stage" in unison, forming an invisible chorus, enhancing Hou Dejian's uniquely flavored singing. The stage and the audience blended into one, creating a very lively atmosphere. After the song ended, Hou Dejian bowed and left the stage, and the audience responded with calls for "another one" and applause. Hou Dejian is clever, Hou Dejian is "cunning," Hou Dejian knows how to play tricks, all of which are fine. What I want to say is, Hou Dejian came from Taiwan, and he may not know what "ideological and political work" is, but his guiding art, for some of our professional ideological and political workers, may also be enlightening!

　　听侯德健唱歌
    吴滤
    在北京的流行歌曲演唱会上，经常听到少数观众冲着歌星吼叫：“下去吧！下去吧！”
    报纸上发表过不少文章，批评观众的这种不文明行为，演出单位在剧场也反复宣讲“观众须知”。然而，收效似乎都不大。一些“专家”出来解释说：这是现代观众的一种情绪宣泄，他们花钱来剧场，一半是为听歌，一半是为了宣泄，甚至更多是为了宣泄，无须指摘。
    不过，对于歌星来说，这总是杀风景的事情。对于多数听众来说，这种嗓音也是难以接受的。每当这种场合，见到歌星们迎着“下去吧，下去吧”的叫声（尽管只是少数人），从容地站到舞台正中，拿起扩音器时，我是很佩服他们的临场勇气的。
    最近，阔别北京歌坛数年之久的侯德健忽然登台亮相了。他怎么对待“下去吧”的叫声呢？——他奉献给听众一首新歌《下去吧》：
    下去吧，我的神经已经正在衰弱；
    下去吧，这舞台好像不再属于我。
    下去吧，昨天你们还在为我吆喝；
    下去吧，可今天你们怎么这么恨我。
    下去吧，其实咱们大家都没有什么大错；
    下去吧，为什么你恨他，他恨你，你又恨我。
    ……
    听众始而一愣，继而悟了过来，于是出现这样的剧场效应，在侯德健的指挥下，全场观众齐唱“下去吧”，无形中组成一支伴唱大军，烘托着侯德健独具韵味的歌声，台上台下，交融一体，气氛极为热烈。一曲歌了，侯德健躬身退场，台下报以“再来一个”的叫声和掌声。侯德健聪明，侯德健“猴精”，侯德健会玩小计谋，这都不错。我想说的是，侯德健是由台湾过来的，他或许不知道什么叫“思想政治工作”，但他的疏导艺术，对于我们某些专业思想政治工作者，恐怕也是有所启迪的吧！
