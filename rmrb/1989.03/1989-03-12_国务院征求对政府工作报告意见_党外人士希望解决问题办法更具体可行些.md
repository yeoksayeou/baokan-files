The State Council is seeking opinions on the Government Work Report. Non-Communist Party members hope for more specific and feasible solutions to problems.

The State Council, through the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China, held a symposium from March 7 to 10 to gather opinions on the draft of the "Government Work Report" from non-Communist Party members.

Yán Míngfù, a member of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the head of the United Front Work Department, presided over the meeting.

Leaders from various democratic parties, relevant people's organizations, and some ethnic and religious figures, as well as non-partisan intellectuals and non-Communist Party members, totaling 120 people, attended the symposium.

Yuán Mù, Director of the Research Office of the State Council, attended the meeting and introduced the drafting process of the report under the personal supervision of Premier Li Peng, as well as the main themes and basic content of the report.

During the symposium, participants spoke freely and expressed their views frankly, offering many candid and sincere opinions on the draft report.

In their speeches, participants pointed out that the draft of the "Government Work Report" focuses on the principles of improving the economic environment, rectifying economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms, addressing the core issues, and aligning with China's current reality. This will help further mobilize all ethnic groups in the country to boost confidence, enhance morale, and work together to overcome various difficulties on the path forward, steadfastly continuing the work of rectification and order.

Participants noted that the draft of the "Government Work Report" does not shy away from or conceal the difficulties and problems faced in China's current reforms and construction, nor does it hide the mistakes made in the work. This reflects a pragmatic attitude and a sense of responsibility to the people. Participants hope that the report will propose more specific and feasible measures and methods to solve these problems, ensuring that the work of rectification and order can proceed smoothly and healthily.

During the symposium, participants also offered many insightful opinions and suggestions on issues related to education, ethnic minorities, religion, national reunification, and diplomacy.
