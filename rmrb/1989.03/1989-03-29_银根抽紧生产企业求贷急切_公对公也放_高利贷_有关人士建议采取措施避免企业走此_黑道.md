		Recent tightening of credit has left some manufacturing enterprises in a desperate need for loans. Non-production units are taking advantage of this situation to lend money at high interest rates to these enterprises.

		During a recent investigation in the three northeastern provinces, reporters from Xinhua News Agency discovered that some non-production units and enterprises are lending money at high interest rates to manufacturing enterprises that are in urgent need of funds.

		A director of a large factory that produces supporting equipment for national key projects told reporters that since last September, the factory's working capital has been in a state of emergency. Raw materials could not be purchased, and 70% of the factory's workshops had to stop production. In this desperate situation, through introductions, the factory managed to borrow 32.1 million yuan from a non-production enterprise in the south, two military units in North China, and two public institutions in Northeast China. The loan periods ranged from 2 to 3 months, with interest rates between 13% and 16%, far exceeding the bank loan interest rates. This temporarily alleviated the urgent need for funds.

		Directors who borrowed money through this channel refused to provide the names of the lenders to reporters. One director said, "When I was in the most difficult time, they saved me. If I betray them, the bank cannot guarantee my funds, and I will only be seeking my own destruction! In the end, it is still the country that suffers the most."

		Why, when national funds are so tight, do banks allow units and enterprises with idle funds to lend money privately, causing a large amount of funds to circulate outside the system? It was learned that these lenders used the pretexts of "joint venture investment," "return of goods payments," "purchase of materials," and other legal names to "deceive" the banks, transferring large sums of money to the borrowers' accounts. Some economists suggest that the state should take effective measures to quickly bring this part of idle funds under the macro-control of the banks. Some directors hope that the state will ensure the funding needs of key enterprises related to the national economy and people's livelihood, so that they do not have to seek a way out from the "black market."

　　银根抽紧生产企业求贷急切        
    公对公也放“高利贷”     
    有关人士建议采取措施避免企业走此“黑道”
    本报讯  新华社记者新彦、高欣、金虎报道：最近，记者在东北三省调查时发现，有些非生产性企事业单位，正趁国家抽紧银根之机，向一些急需资金的生产企业放“高利贷”。
    一家专门为国家重点工程生产配套设备的大工厂厂长告诉记者，去年９月以后，全厂流动资金告急，原材料无法购进，７０％的分厂停产。在求贷无门的绝境下，经人介绍，先后从南方一个非生产企业、华北两个部队和东北两个事业单位借到３２１０万元，借期２到３个月，利率为１３％到１６％，远高于银行贷款利率，总算解了燃眉之急。
    通过这种途径借到“高利贷”的厂长们，都拒绝向记者提供放贷户名。一个厂长说：“在我最困难的时候，是他们救了我。我如果把他们‘卖’了，银行又保证不了我的资金，还不是自寻绝路！到头来还是国家损失大。”
    为什么国家资金这么紧张，银行却听凭那些握有闲置资金的企事业单位私自放贷，让大量资金“体外循环”呢？经了解，那些放贷户都是假借“联营投资”、“退还货款”、“购买材料”等合法名义，“瞒”过银行，将大笔资金转到借贷户名下的。一些经济界人士建议国家采取得力措施，尽快将这部分闲置资金纳入银行宏观控制轨道。一些厂长则希望，国家应保证关系国计民生的重点企业的资金需求，使他们不必再从“黑道”上去寻出路。
