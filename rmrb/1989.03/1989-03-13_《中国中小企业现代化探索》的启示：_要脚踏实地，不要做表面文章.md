In the contemporary global economy, small and medium-sized industrial enterprises hold a significant position. Countries around the world place high value on these enterprises. Over the past few years, China's small and medium-sized enterprises have developed rapidly. By the end of last year, their total number exceeded 400,000 (including township enterprises, reaching 7.4 million), accounting for 99.4% of the total number of industrial enterprises, 70% of the total industrial output value, and over 80% of the employment. Although China has a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises, their quality is relatively low compared to industrialized countries, and they generally face issues of low technological and management levels and poor economic efficiency. Through deepening reforms, improving the quality and modernization level of small and medium-sized enterprises, and enabling them to play a greater role in socialist construction, is an important task before us.

However, how can we improve the quality of small and medium-sized enterprises? People have different ideas and approaches. One approach is to focus on superficial gestures, creating new slogans and phrases, proposing things like "new work methods" and "new responsibility systems" to replace solid, practical work. If genuine effort is put into work methods, management systems, and regulations, conducting reforms and innovations thoroughly and meticulously rather than superficially, that would be commendable. However, in reality, some practices are merely empty in name, offering little actual benefit to improving economic efficiency or promoting the development of small and medium-sized enterprises. Another approach is to start from the actual situation of China's small and medium-sized enterprises, focusing on strengthening the foundational work of enterprises, seriously improving enterprise management, and investing significant effort into studying and solving various practical problems related to the forces and relations of production that affect enterprise development. The former approach may seem lively on the surface but yields poor results; the latter approach requires real effort but can improve the quality and level of enterprises, fundamentally solving the problem of low economic efficiency.

Zheng Zonghan's new book, "Exploring the Modernization of China's Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises," advocates for the latter approach and offers many insights worth noting. The book starts from the actual situation of China's small and medium-sized enterprises, studying their current state, analyzing their advantages and disadvantages, their scale, organizational structure, labor tools, labor objects, products, labor force quality, and the main problems, contradictions, and causes of backwardness in township enterprises, and proposing solutions to these problems. The author does not address these issues superficially but combines theory with practice, elevating the discussion to the level of identifying patterns, thus providing enlightenment.

The author believes that we should gradually transform China's small and medium-sized enterprises. The focus should be on enterprise management, production technology, human quality, and macro-management, with technology and management being the foundation. Some issues related to production technology have been raised by people for a long time but have not been systematically studied; others are often overlooked. For example, the modernization of labor objects. The author points out that in technological transformations, people generally pay more attention to labor tools but often overlook labor objects. In fact, the importance of the modernization of labor objects is not inferior to that of labor tools. The modernization of labor objects not only directly determines the quantity, variety, quality structure, cost, and benefits of an enterprise's products but also determines the enterprise's process flow, production development direction, and even the social production structure. Therefore, choosing more appropriate labor objects, expanding the scope of labor objects, improving the composition of labor objects, making more natural and economic resources that were not originally labor objects enter production, and using labor objects more scientifically and rationally, are important conditions for accelerating the modernization process of small and medium-sized enterprises and improving their economic benefits.

For example, the issue of enterprise scale. The author believes that small and medium-sized enterprises play an important role in modernization construction, but this does not mean they can play a role unconditionally; whether small and medium-sized enterprises can play a role and even exist and develop depends on several conditions, among which the rationality of the enterprise scale is an important condition. From the perspective of a single enterprise, the scale of the enterprise will be constrained by factors such as capital, supply of raw materials, market demand, and management level; from the perspective of an industry, the scale of the enterprise will be constrained by the total demand for products in the entire industry and the total supply of raw materials; while the scale of all small and medium-sized enterprises will be constrained by the overall national economy and total demand. The scale of enterprises exists in the relationship between the initial scale, optimal scale, maximum scale, individual enterprise scale, and departmental total production scale, and it should be continuously adjusted according to changes in macro conditions. The author analyzed the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises in several industries such as water resources, small and medium-sized motors, and watches, and pointed out that the irrationality of enterprise scale and industry scale is an important reason for low economic benefits. To address the problem of long-term low efficiency, we must start from the overall situation, first improve and calculate the total benefits of the entire society, and consciously adjust the scale and structure of enterprises. These insights are all worth noting.

This book is rich in data, with many materials obtained from the author's own field investigations. The book's shortcoming is that it does not delve into management issues, perhaps because this issue has been discussed extensively in other works.

　　《中国中小企业现代化探索》的启示：
    要脚踏实地，不要做表面文章
    汪从容
    在当代世界经济中，中小型工业企业占有重要位置。世界各国对中小型企业都给予很高的评价。这些年来，我国中小型企业发展很快，到去年底止，总数已超过４０万个（加上乡镇工业达７４０万个），占工业企业总数的９９．４％，产值占工业总产值的７０％，就业人数占８０％以上。我国中小企业数量很大，但与工业发达国家比，素质较低，普遍存在技术水平、管理水平低和经济效益差的问题。通过深化改革，提高中小企业的素质和现代化程度，使之在社会主义建设中发挥更大的作用，是摆在我们面前的一项重要任务。
    但是如何提高中小企业的素质？人们的想法和做法存在着很大的差异。一种是做表面文章，在新口号、新提法上搞花样翻新，提出诸如什么“新工作法”、“新责任制”等等，来代替踏踏实实的实际工作。如果真正在工作方法和管理体制、规章制度上下工夫，认真地而不是草率地、深入细致地而不是表面地进行改革和创新，那是值得称道的；可是实际上有些做法只是徒具虚名，对提高经济效益，促进中小企业发展并不会带来多少实际好处。另一种是从我国中小企业的实际出发，脚踏实地地加强企业的基础工作，认真地加强企业管理，花大力气研究和解决影响企业发展的生产力和生产关系方面存在的种种实际问题。前一种做法表面热闹，效果不好；后一种做法要下真工夫，却能够提高企业的素质和水平，从根本上解决经济效益低的问题。
    郑宗汉的新著《中国中小型企业现代化探索》一书，在倡导后一种做法上提出了不少值得重视的见解。这本书从我国中小企业的实际出发，研究了中小企业的现状，分别对中小企业的优势和不足之处，对它们的规模、组织结构、劳动手段、劳动对象、产品、劳动力素质以及乡镇企业中存在的主要问题、矛盾和落后的原因作了解剖，并提出了解决这些问题的办法。作者在回答这些问题时，不是就事论事，而是理论结合实际，提高到规律性上进行研究，从而给人以启迪。
    作者认为应对我国中小企业逐步进行改造。重点是企业管理、生产技术，人的素质和宏观管理，其中技术和管理是基础。有关生产技术上的问题，有些人们早已提出来，但没有作系统的研究；有的是时常被人忽视的。例如劳动对象现代化问题。作者提出，在技术改造中，人们一般比较重视劳动手段，而常常忽视劳动对象。其实，劳动对象现代化的重要性并不比劳动手段低。劳动对象的现代化不仅直接决定企业产品的产量、品种、质量结构、成本和效益，而且决定着企业的工艺流程、生产发展方向直至社会生产结构。因此，选择更适当的劳动对象，扩大劳动对象的范围，改善劳动对象的构成，使更多原来不是劳动对象的自然资源和经济资源投入生产，以及更科学合理地使用劳动对象，就成为加速中小企业现代化进程，和提高其经济效益的重要条件。
    再如企业规模问题。作者认为，中小型企业在现代化建设中具有重要作用，但是决不是说它们可以无条件地发挥作用；中小企业能否发挥作用以至能否存在发展，决定于若干条件，其中企业的规模合理与否是一个重要条件。从一个企业看，企业的规模会受到资金、原材料供应量、市场需求、管理水平等因素的制约；从一个行业来说，企业规模会受到整个行业产品需求量和原材料供应总量的制约；而所有中小企业的规模又会受到整个社会经济和总需求的制约。企业规模存在着起始规模、最优规模、最高规模、个别企业规模和部门生产总规模相互关系的规律，它应该随着宏观条件的变化而不断调整。作者解剖了我国水源、中小电机、手表等几个行业中中小型企业的情况，提出企业规模和行业规模不合理是经济效益低的重要原因。要立足于全局，首先改善和计算全社会的总效益，对企业规模和结构进行自觉调整，才能解决效益长期低的问题。这些见解，都值得重视。　　这本书资料比较丰富，有不少材料是作者在自己实地调查中取得的第一手资料。本书不足之处是对管理问题未花笔墨，或许是因为这一问题在别的论著中已谈得很多的缘故。
