Over 600 female representatives attended the Seventh National People's Congress (NPC) Working Conference. On the evening of March 21, some of these female representatives were invited to the All-China Women's Federation for a discussion. Zhang Zhuoying, Vice Chairman and First Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, welcomed them back to their "home" to discuss national politics.

Choson (Korean) ethnic representative Yan Zaisun believes that the improvement of women's social status largely depends on the improvement of women's own qualities. Women should cultivate a spirit of self-respect, self-confidence, self-reliance, and self-strengthening. Sichuan representative He Yuxing appealed to stop the practice of some units "preferring a short man over a heroine" and to truly achieve gender equality in employment, education, and promotions.

Qiang ethnic representative Yang Songying said, "In our area, 80% of the agricultural labor force is female. Women's labor requires science and cultural knowledge. However, in remote areas, parents are willing to let their sons go to school but not their daughters. This not only affects the quality of the next generation of women but also impacts women's political status."

Hunan representative Si Maqiong started from the uncivilized behavior of some young women in society, advocating for strengthening female education and suggesting the appointment of a dedicated female guidance counselor in middle schools.

Sichuan Provincial People's Congress representative Huang Qixian, who is also a Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, suggested strengthening management to prohibit illegal individual and private business owners from infringing on the legal rights of female employees; the judicial departments should punish, according to law, the relatively prominent bigamy phenomena in some regions; formulate township and village enterprise labor laws to strictly prohibit the employment of child labor; implement the Compulsory Education Law to stop student dropout and children from quitting school; formulate regulations to investigate and ban prostitution activities; and take effective measures to crack down on crimes such as the trafficking of women and children.

　　岂能“宁用武大郎、不要穆桂英”        
    ——人大部分妇女代表座谈侧记
    本报记者  冯媛
    出席七届人大工作会议的，有６００多位妇女代表。３月２１日晚，部分妇女代表应邀到全国妇联座谈。全国妇联副主席、书记处第一书记张帼英欢迎她们回“娘家”议国政。
    朝鲜族代表严载顺认为，妇女社会地位的提高，在很大程度上取决于妇女自身素质的提高。妇女要树立自尊自信自立自强精神。四川代表何玉兴呼吁，要制止一些单位“宁用武大郎，不要穆桂英”的做法，真正实现在就业、入学、提干诸方面的“男女平等”。
    羌族代表杨松英说：“我们那里农业劳动力８０％是妇女，妇女劳动需要科学，需要文化知识。但是在偏僻地区，家长愿让男娃娃上学，不愿让女娃娃上学，这不仅影响下一代妇女素质的提高，也影响到妇女的政治地位。”
    湖南代表司马琼从社会上一些青年妇女言行不文明谈起，呼吁加强女性教育，建议在中学设专门的女生训导主任。
    四川省人大代表黄启璪，又是全国妇联副主席。她建议，加强管理，禁止不法个体工商户侵犯女雇工合法权益；司法部门依法惩处一些地区较为突出的重婚现象；制订乡镇企业劳动法，严禁雇佣童工；贯彻实施义务教育法，制止学生流失、儿童辍学；制订查禁和取缔嫖娼卖淫活动的法规；采取有力措施打击拐卖妇女、儿童等犯罪活动。
