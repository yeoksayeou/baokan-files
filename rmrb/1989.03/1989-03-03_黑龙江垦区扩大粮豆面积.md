	The Heilongjiang Reclamation Area, a major commercial grain base in China, is increasing its investment by 140 million yuan this year for agricultural infrastructure construction. The grain and bean planting area that has been confirmed so far is 27.56 million mu, an increase of 3.63 million mu compared to last year.

	To ensure a bumper harvest this year, the reclamation area is taking every possible measure to increase agricultural investment and improve production conditions. It will also vigorously promote ten new agricultural technologies with significant yield-increasing effects, such as the promotion of high-yield varieties, chemical weeding, and deep fertilization for wheat. The goal is to increase grain and bean production by 300 million kilograms through these measures.
