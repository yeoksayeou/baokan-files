The U.S. Department of Commerce announced on March 23 that the adjusted annual growth rate of the U.S. Gross National Product for the fourth quarter of last year was 2.4%, and the adjusted economic growth rate for the entire year was 3.9%.

The Department of Commerce stated that the original estimate for the economic growth rate in the fourth quarter of last year was 2%, and for the entire year, it was 3.8%. The upward revision of the economic growth rate for the fourth quarter is due to the fact that government spending and business investment in new equipment in that quarter were higher than originally estimated.

The Bush administration predicts that the U.S. economy will grow by 3.2% this year, while private economists predict a growth of only 2.7%.

　　去年美经济增长３．９％        
    今年预计将稍有下降
    新华社华盛顿３月２３日电  美国商务部２３日宣布，去年第４季度美国调整后的国民生产总值的增长年率为２．４％，去年全年调整后的经济增长率为３．９％。
    商务部说，去年第４季度的经济增长率原估计为２％，全年的经济增长率为３．８％。去年第４季度的经济增长率往上调，是因为该季度美国的政府开支和企业对新设备的投资增长率比原先估计的高。
    布什政府预计，今年美国经济将增长３．２％，而私人经济学家们预计仅能增长２．７％。
