Labor Dispute Case Sparks Controversy: Dismissal: Light or Heavy? Judgment: Fair or Unfair?
Reporters: Jiang Tianqing, Gu Yunling, Yanfu Masses Daily

On December 22, 1988, the People's Court of Dongtai City, Jiangsu Province, held a trial for a labor dispute case. The presiding judge announced the verdict on the spot: to revoke the decision of Dongtai Glass Fiber Factory to dismiss worker Pan Ronggui; to compensate Pan Ronggui's wages and benefits; and to restore Pan Ronggui's job.

As the presiding judge's words fell, the court erupted in chaos. Subsequently, this news quickly spread throughout Tai City and gradually affected various counties and districts in Yancheng City.

The Origin of the Case

This was the first labor dispute case in Yancheng City. On March 4, 1988, Pan Ronggui, a full-time contract worker at Dongtai Glass Fiber Factory, was approved by the workshop director to take 10 days of compensatory leave and left on March 6. On March 7, another worker, A, also requested 5 days of leave and left on March 10. Both did not return by the due date and their whereabouts were unknown. On March 23, the factory issued a notice to Pan and A to return to work within a specified period. On March 25, they were issued a "yellow card" warning. Before this, the families of both had gone out to look for them without success. On April 9, the factory's management committee, factory management committee, and trade union committee unanimously decided to dismiss Pan Ronggui for consecutive absences of 24 days and A for 26 days, in accordance with the "Enterprise Law" and the "Enterprise Employee Reward and Punishment Regulations" as well as the factory's relevant regulations.

On April 12, Pan Ronggui went to the factory to express his objection to being dismissed and on April 16, filed a complaint with the Dongtai City Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission (A did not file a complaint). The Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission conducted mediations on May 6 and 10, but Pan Ronggui did not attend. On June 15, the arbitration commission made a ruling, confirming that Pan had actually been absent for 18 consecutive days, and the factory's decision to dismiss him was correct. Pan refused to accept the arbitration decision, refused to receive the arbitration decision book, and sued Dongtai City People's Court. The court made the judgment mentioned at the beginning of this article after more than five months.

Before and after the trial of this case, Dongtai Glass Fiber Factory and the court had intense disputes. Dismissal: Light or Heavy?

The factory's decision to dismiss Pan Ronggui and the arbitration commission and court's handling of the case were mainly based on the 18th article of the third chapter of the "Enterprise Employee Reward and Punishment Regulations" issued by the State Council in 1982, which states: "If an employee frequently absents without valid reasons, fails to improve after criticism and education, and is absent for more than 15 consecutive days, or accumulates more than 30 days of absence within a year, the enterprise has the right to dismiss the employee." However, there were sharp disagreements on how to specifically apply this article.

What was Pan Ronggui's usual performance before he was absent? The factory believed that since Pan joined the factory, he had not been proactive, had lax labor discipline, and had been caught stealing factory steel on November 15, 1984, during his shift. He was recorded as absent for one day, suspended from work for four days for inspection, and removed from the list of the factory's sixth session of the Workers' Congress. The court's judges, however, believed that Pan Ronggui had skills, had been a team leader, and had been elected to the Workers' Congress, so his performance should be considered good.

Had he been criticized and educated without effect? The factory believed that when the factory formulated the employee reward and punishment methods and the interim regulations for handling disciplinary employees, Pan Ronggui was directly involved. According to these regulations, the factory had also handled two workers. Therefore, Pan Ronggui's consecutive absences were deliberate; before his dismissal, the factory had issued a notice to return to work within a specified period and a "yellow card" warning. Education should not be viewed as a single form of face-to-face criticism after the fact but should be understood as multiple methods and forms. Otherwise, if an employee is absent for a long time, the enterprise would have no way to handle it. Moreover, Pan Ronggui has not yet admitted his error of being absent for 18 days to the factory and has shown no signs of repentance. After the judgment, he even proudly went to the power distribution room, where smoking is strictly prohibited, to ask someone to smoke. The court believed that the factory, knowing that Pan's whereabouts were unknown and his family's search was unsuccessful, issued a notice to return to work within a specified period and a "yellow card" warning, which, since they were not actually delivered to Pan, did not have an educational effect. Later, when Pan was absent without leave and without the opportunity to defend himself, the decision to dismiss him was made hastily and without due diligence. During the court's trial, Pan was able to recognize his mistake and express remorse. The factory, in response to the court's point that Pan was not given the opportunity to defend himself, cited relevant regulations and believed this was not a necessary condition.

Were there mitigating circumstances for the error of being absent for 18 days? The factory believed that when Pan Ronggui requested compensatory leave, the workshop director had clearly stated that exceeding the leave would be considered an absence. During Pan's absence, his family had come to the factory to extend his leave, which was neither valid nor had a time limit and was correctly not recognized. The court believed that since 1984, Pan Ronggui had accumulated 24.5 days of compensatory leave for overtime work over more than four years. Workers have the right to work and also the right to rest. Additionally, Pan's family had applied for an extension of leave, which should be considered a condition for lenient treatment.

The reporter interviewed Pan Ronggui himself. When asked why he was absent, he said it was due to family disputes and he went out to clear his mind. When asked why he did not attend the arbitration mediation, he said he had gone to Gaoxian Village, Mengzhuang Town, Huixian County, Henan Province, to the Gaoxian Glass Fiber Factory for personal matters.

Trial: Fair or Unfair?

The factory believed that the Dongtai City Court had violated the law in multiple aspects during the trial of this case and held doubts about the legal effect of the judgment. The main reasons were threefold:

In terms of the statute of limitations for the lawsuit, the Dongtai Court's notice of acceptance stated: "Our court has received your lawsuit against Dongtai Glass Fiber Factory for your dismissal on July 6, 1988..." However, the court later stated that Pan Ronggui had sued the court on June 30. Consequently, there were obvious traces of the court's personnel altering the legal documents, changing the date from July 6 to June 30, in the court's stamp on Pan's lawsuit. The factory believed that the court's personnel had tampered with legal documents and, based on the "Interim Regulations on the Handling of Labor Disputes in State-Owned Enterprises" issued by the State Council, believed that Pan Ronggui's statute of limitations for the lawsuit should have ended on June 29, and the arbitration decision would take effect from June 30 and should be executed. The court should not have accepted the case, let alone tried it.

During the trial of this case, in the court investigation stage, the judges read out evidence favorable to Pan Ronggui but did not read out unfavorable evidence; they asked questions favorable to the plaintiff, and if the plaintiff did not answer fully, they provided hints. In the debate stage, an extremely rare scene occurred: the judges and the factory's representatives engaged in a debate, and the factory's representatives protested twice on the spot. Based on this, the factory believed that the collegial panel representing the state to exercise judicial power had become Pan Ronggui's spokesperson.

The delivery of the judgment exceeded the legally prescribed time limit, and the content of the judgment was significantly different from the court's announcement, omitting the last two points. The factory believed this damaged the dignity of the law.

The judges of this case believed that the trial was extremely cautious and emphasized that the law was not perfect, the court had few personnel, and it was difficult to enforce the law, hoping that all parties would understand.

The court pointed out regarding the statute of limitations for the lawsuit in this case that when Pan refused to accept the arbitration decision, the arbitration commission left the decision book with the factory and could not be considered delivered. The arbitration commission, based on the 23rd article of the fifth chapter of the "Yancheng City Labor Dispute Arbitration Commission Work Rules," believed that leaving the arbitration documents at the workplace or residence of the party concerned was considered delivered.

The Lawsuit Has Not Yet Concluded

After the court trial, factory director Zhu Huiren said: "Only requiring enterprise reform, without corresponding reforms in other aspects, is like putting us factory directors on the fire!"

During the interview, the reporter invited six enterprise leaders for a discussion. Their indignation was evident. They supported the glass fiber factory in fighting the lawsuit to the end!

In Dongtai City Committee and City Government, the reporter also heard different opinions. Some comrades believed: If people like Pan Ronggui are not dismissed, what discipline and system can be maintained? How can we talk about labor and personnel system reform?! Some comrades believed that bad practices can infiltrate everywhere, including law enforcement agencies, and were worried about this, suggesting that while emphasizing the court's independent trial and independent case handling, legal supervision should be strengthened. Some comrades believed that the handling of people should be more cautious, especially for someone like Pan Ronggui, who is over 30 and unmarried, will he become an unstable factor after being dismissed?

How do ordinary workers view Pan Ronggui's dismissal? On the afternoon of January 18, the reporter conducted a public opinion survey at the glass fiber factory. The reporter handed out 86 opinion forms to the workers on duty and collected 85. The attitudes towards dismissing Pan Ronggui were as follows: 43 supported it, 23 thought it was too heavy, 17 abstained, and 2 opposed. Obviously, more than half supported it. Those who supported it believed: Even during the time of the "iron rice bowl," no one dared to be absent for so many days. Now, with the factory director's responsibility system and contract management, Pan Ronggui dared to be absent for dozens of days, which is unimaginable! Those who opposed it believed: Pan Ronggui should be given a chance to correct his mistake. Making a mistake does not mean he should be struck down with one blow.

The final answer to the dispute over this case will be given by the law. Dongtai Glass Fiber Factory is not satisfied with the first-instance judgment of Dongtai Court and has appealed to the Intermediate People's Court of Yancheng City. How the Intermediate Court will judge, everyone is waiting to see!

    劳动争议案引出的争议
    除名：是轻还是重？判决：是公还是不公？
    江苏《盐阜大众报》记者　姜天庆　顾云岭
    1988年12月22日，江苏省东台市人民法院开庭审理一起劳动争议案。审判长当庭宣判：撤销东台市玻璃纤维厂将该厂工人潘荣贵除名的决定；补发潘荣贵的工资及各种待遇；恢复潘荣贵的工作。
    审判长话音刚落，法庭哗然。之后，这一消息迅速传遍台城，渐渐波及到盐城市各县区。
    案件的缘起
    这是盐城市第一起劳动争议案。1988年3月4日，东台市玻璃纤维厂全民合同制工人潘荣贵经车间主任批准补休10天，3月6日外出。3月7日，同厂的女工A亦请假5天，10日外出。两人均到期未归，且去向不明。3月23日，厂方向潘、A两人分别发出限期回厂通知书，25日发出“黄牌”警告。此前，两人家属皆分别外出寻找，未有着落。4月9日，厂务会、厂管理委员会、工会委员会确认潘荣贵已连续旷工24天，A已连续旷工26天，按照《企业法》和《企业职工奖罚条例》以及厂里有关规定，一致议决分别予以除名。
    4月12日，潘荣贵到厂对将他除名表示异议，于16日向东台市劳动争议仲裁委员会申诉（A未申诉）。劳动争议仲裁委员会分别于5月6日、10日进行调解，潘荣贵却均未到场。6月15日，仲裁委作出裁决，确认潘实际连续旷工18天，厂方决定除名是正确的。潘不服裁决，拒收仲裁决定书，并向东台市人民法院起诉，法院在5个多月后作出本文开头的判决。
    在审理此案前后，东台玻纤厂等方与法院发生了激烈争议。除名：是轻？是重？
    厂方将潘荣贵除名以及仲裁委和法院审理此案，主要依据国务院1982年发布的《企业职工奖罚条例》第3章第18条，即“职工无正当理由经常旷工，经批评教育无效，连续旷工时间超过15天，或者一年以内累计旷工时间超过30天的，企业有权予以除名”。但在如何具体适用这一条上却存在尖锐分歧。
    潘荣贵连续旷工前的一贯表现怎样？厂方认为，潘进厂以来不求上进，劳动纪律松弛，曾于1984年11月15日当班时间偷窃厂里钢材，被派出所查实后记旷工一天，停工检查4天，取消厂一届六次职代会主席团成员资格。而法院审判人员认为，潘荣贵有技术，当过班长，被选进职代会，应当说表现是好的。
    是否经批评教育无效？厂方认为，厂里制定职工奖惩办法和有关处理违纪职工的暂行规定时，潘荣贵都是直接参加的，按此规定，厂里也先后处理过2名工人。因此，潘荣贵连续旷工是明知故犯；对他除名前，厂方曾发出限期回厂通知书和“黄牌”警告。教育，不应视为事后当面批评一种，应当理解为多种途径和形式。否则，职工连续旷工时间再长，企业不就无法处理？况且，潘荣贵至今未向厂方承认其旷工18天的错误，无任何悔过表现。判决后，他还洋洋得意地到严禁烟火的配电间请人抽烟。法院认为，厂方在明知潘外出去向不明，家人寻找未着的情况下，发出限期回厂通知和“黄牌”警告，因未实际送达潘本人，故起不到教育的作用，后在他出走未归、没有申辩的情况下就作出除名决定，显得仓促和欠慎重。法院审理中潘能认识错误，表示悔改。厂方针对法院提出的没有让潘申辩这一条，引据有关法规，认为这不是必须条件。
    对旷工18天的错误有无从轻情节？厂方认为，潘荣贵请补休假时，车间主任即言明，超假即以旷工论处。潘在外不归期间，家里人曾来厂为其续休，既无正当理由，又无期限，不予承认是对的。法院认为，潘荣贵从1984年起，4年多时间累计有加班补休假24.5天。工人有劳动的权利，也有休息的权利。另外，潘的家人曾代为续假，均应视为从宽处理的条件。
    记者采访过潘荣贵本人。对为什么旷工？他说因家庭纠纷外出散散心。问他仲裁调解时为何不到场？他说因私事到河南省辉县孟庄乡高村峥嵘玻纤厂去了。
    审判：是公？不公？
    厂方认为，东台市法院审理此案中多处违法，对判决的法律效力持怀疑态度。主要理由有三：
    在诉讼时效上，东台法院受案通知书称：“我院已接到你于1988年7月6日诉东台玻纤厂对你除名不服的起诉状……”但法院后称潘荣贵是6月30日向法院起诉的。因而，案卷中法院盖在潘的诉状上的收阅章日期出现了将7月6日改为6月30日的明显痕迹。对此，厂方认定法院有关人员篡改法律文书，并根据国务院发布的《国营企业劳动争议处理暂行规定》第3章第25条：“当事人一方或者双方对仲裁不服的，可以在收到仲裁决定书之日起15日内向人民法院起诉……”认为潘荣贵的起诉有效期应为6月29日止，30日起仲裁决定即发生法律效力，应予执行。法院根本不应受理此案，更不应予以审判。
    在开庭审理此案期间，庭审调查阶段，审判人员有利于潘荣贵的证词就宣读，不利于他的证词就不读；有利于原告的问题就提，原告答不全则予以提示。辩论阶段，出现了极为少有的场面：审判人员和厂方的代理人进行辩论，厂方委托代理人两次当庭提出抗议。据此，厂方认为，代表国家行使审判权的此案合议庭竟成了潘荣贵的代言人。
    判决书的送达超过法律规定的期限，且判决内容比当庭宣判的有重大改动，删去了后两条。厂方认为这有损法律的尊严。
    此案审判人员则认为此案审理是极为慎重的，同时强调了法律不健全，法院人手少以及执法难等原因，希望各方理解。
    法院针对此案诉讼时效问题指出，潘拒收仲裁决定时，仲裁委将决定书留置予厂方，不能视为送达。而仲裁委根据江苏省《劳动争议仲裁委员会工作规则》第5章第23条规定，认为把仲裁文书留在当事人的单位或住处，即视为送达。
    诉讼尚未终结
    法庭审判后，厂长朱惠人说：只要求企业改革，其他方面不配套改革，不是把我们厂长放在火上烤？！
    采访中记者曾邀请了6个企业的负责人座谈。他们对此事的激愤之情溢于言表。他们支持玻纤厂把官司打到底！
    在东台市委、市政府，记者也听到几种不同的反映。一些同志认为：对潘荣贵这样的人不除名，还有什么纪律制度可言？还谈什么劳动人事制度改革？！一些同志认为，不正之风无孔不入，也会渗透进执法机关，并为此而忧心忡忡，建议在强调法院独立审判、独立办案的同时，要加强法律监督。还有一些同志认为，处理人要慎重一些，特别是像潘荣贵这样的人，30出头，尚未结婚，除名后被推到社会，会不会成为不安定的因素？
    普通工人对潘荣贵除名怎么看？1月18日下午，记者在玻纤厂搞了一次民意测验，记者向当班人员当面发了86张意见表，收回85张，对将潘荣贵除名的态度分别是：赞成43人，认为过重23人，弃权17人，反对2人。显然，赞成的超过半数以上。持赞成态度者的意见是：过去“大锅饭”盛行的时候，也没有人敢旷工这么多天。现在厂长负责制，经营承包了，潘荣贵竟敢旷工几十天，真想不到！持反对态度者的意见是：应当给潘荣贵一次改正错误的机会。犯了错误，不能一棍子打死。
    对此案的争议最终将由法律来作出回答。东台玻纤厂不服东台法院一审判决，已将该案上诉至盐城市中级人民法院。市中级法院如何判决，人们拭目以待！
