According to banking experts, as the global technological revolution advances, the trend for Chinese banks will be towards electronic banking. Along with this trend, China's banking system will undergo three major transformations:

- Banks will no longer be purely engaged in deposit, loan, and remittance services but will gradually develop into multifunctional financial institutions;
- Currently, the primary source of income for Chinese banks is the interest differential between deposits and loans, but in the future, service fees will become the main source of income for banks;
- Banks will shift from the management of money and currency issuance to information management.

　　我国银行将出现三种变革
    据有关银行专家分析预测，随着世界新技术革命的深入，银行电子化是我国银行今后的发展趋势，伴随这种趋势，我国银行系统将出现三种变革：
    ——银行不再是单纯经营存款、贷款、汇款的金融机构，而逐渐向多功能的金融机构发展；
    ——目前我国银行收入的主要来源是存款和贷款之间的利息差额，而今后将以服务费作为银行主要收入来源；
    ——银行将由钱财保管、货币发行转向信息管理。
