Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, Tehran, March 14th.

Gunfire has shattered six months of relative calm along the Iraq-Iran border, as military engagements resumed between the two countries. Both sides have accused the other of violating the ceasefire agreement.

The Iraqi Foreign Ministry issued a statement on March 14th, asserting that Iranian forces opened fire on Iraqi troops in the border region the previous night. The statement, however, did not provide specific details about the conflict. It demanded that the United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar record Iran's actions as an official document of the Security Council.

Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic News Agency of Iran quoted an Iranian military officer, accusing Iraq of violating the ceasefire agreement in the southern front, resulting in the injury of five Iranian soldiers.

The Iranian side stated that Iraqi forces fired at their positions at 9 PM local time on March 13th, prompting the Iranian military to retaliate in self-defense.

Since the ceasefire agreement between the two countries took effect on August 20th of last year, the 1,180-kilometer-long border between Iraq and Iran has remained relatively calm under the supervision of the United Nations Military Observer Group.

　　枪炮声打破半年平静
    两伊边境重开战
    双方相互指责违反停火协议
    新华社巴格达、德黑兰３月１４日电  伊拉克和伊朗军队１３日在南部边界地区发生交火，两国相互指责对方违反了停火协议。
    伊拉克外交部１４日发表声明说，伊朗军队１３日晚在边境地区向伊拉克军队开了火。但声明没有提供冲突的具体细节。声明要求联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔将伊朗的这一行动作为安理会正式文件记录在案。
    与此同时，伊朗伊斯兰共和国通讯社当天援引伊朗一名军官的话，谴责伊拉克在南部战线违反停火协议，打伤５名伊朗士兵。
    伊朗方面说，伊拉克军队在１３日当地时间２１点向伊朗阵地开火，“伊朗军队被迫自卫还击”。
    自去年８月２０日两伊停火协议生效以来，在联合国军事观察团的控制下，１１８０公里长的两伊边境一直保持相对平静。
