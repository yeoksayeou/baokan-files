The international stage is witnessing a dazzling diplomatic contest between the United States and the Soviet Union.

At the end of last year, Gorbachev, during the transition between two U.S. administrations, announced at the United Nations that the Soviet Union would reduce its military personnel by 500,000 in Eastern Europe and on its own territory, which shook the entire European continent. At the same time, the Soviet Union actively worked to adjust its relations with Asian countries. Gorbachev visited India and then, using the Moscow meeting between the foreign ministers of China and the Soviet Union as an opportunity, the Soviet foreign minister successively visited Japan, the Philippines, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and China. The Soviet Union's diplomatic offensive from the Atlantic and Pacific wings put considerable pressure on the United States.

Facing the Soviet offensive, the newly inaugurated President Bush, although he had not yet formed his foreign policy decision-making team, was not idle. In Europe, U.S. Secretary of State Baker visited 14 Western European allied countries from February 11 to 16, understanding the mood in Western Europe after the Soviet Union announced unilateral disarmament, attempting to bridge the gap between the United States and West Germany on the modernization of short-range missiles, and seeking a common position for NATO in the upcoming negotiations on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe. This visit prepared the United States for adjusting its European policy in the new situation.

In Asia, President Bush took the opportunity of attending the funeral of Japan's Emperor Hirohito to visit Japan, China, and South Korea, estimating the position of Northeast Asia in future U.S. Asian policy. Foreign media considered this a move by the United States to preempt Gorbachev in the triangular relationship, using this step to strengthen U.S.-China friendly cooperation and balance the impending normalization of Sino-Soviet relations.

Meanwhile, Soviet diplomacy advanced in the Middle East, the junction of Europe and Asia. The United States, due to its support for Israel, found it difficult to adapt to the new situation after the declaration of the establishment of the Palestinian state and may only come up with a more innovative plan after Israeli Prime Minister Shamir's visit to the United States.

In this situation, the Soviet Union, taking advantage of the completion of its withdrawal from Afghanistan and the improvement of its image in the Arab world, sent Foreign Minister Shevardnadze to visit Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Iraq, and Iran starting from February 17, and held talks with Israeli Foreign Minister Arens in Egypt to seek the initiative in convening an international conference to solve the Middle East problem. He was received by Khomeini in Iran, and at a time when Western relations with Iran were deteriorating due to the Rushdie affair, he strengthened Soviet-Iranian relations, gaining a significant diplomatic point.

The author believes that up to now, these frequent diplomatic activities by the United States and the Soviet Union are all aimed at strengthening their respective positions. However, since they occur in the context of a global trend toward détente, these diplomatic contests are also products of a competitive coexistence between the United States and the Soviet Union seeking a balance of interests. If the United States and the Soviet Union can do more for world and regional peace and development on the basis of considering their own and each other's interests, 1989 may be a year full of hope.

### 眼花缭乱的外交角逐

　　眼花缭乱的外交角逐
    塞北
    国际舞台上正在展开一场令人眼花缭乱的美苏外交角逐。
    去年年底，戈尔巴乔夫在美国两届政府交替之际，在联合国宣布从东欧和本土裁军５０万人，震动了整个欧洲。与此同时，苏联积极着手调整同亚洲国家的关系。戈尔巴乔夫访问了印度，接着以中苏外长莫斯科会谈为契机，苏联外长先后访问了日本、菲律宾、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中国。苏联的外交攻势，从大西洋和太平洋两翼对美国形成了很大压力。
    面对苏联的攻势，刚刚入主白宫的布什总统虽然还未能组成美国对外政策的决策班子，却并非无所作为。在欧洲方面，美国国务卿贝克从２月１１日到１６日对西欧１４个盟国进行了旋风式的访问，了解在苏联宣布单方面裁军的情况下西欧的情绪，试图弥合美国与联邦德国之间在短程导弹现代化上的分歧，并谋求北约集团在即将举行的欧洲裁减常规军备谈判中的共同立场。这次访问为美国在新形势下调整欧洲政策作了准备。
    在亚洲方面，布什总统乘参加日本裕仁天皇葬礼的机会访问了日本、中国和南朝鲜，以估计东北亚地区在今后美国亚洲政策中的地位。外电认为这是美国在大三角关系中比戈尔巴乔夫先着的一鞭，用这一步加强美中友好合作关系，平衡即将到来的苏中关系正常化。
    与此同时，苏联外交却在欧洲与亚洲的接合部中东地区推进。美国在这个地区由于支持以色列，对于巴勒斯坦国宣告成立以后出现的新形势一时难以适应，要在以色列总理沙米尔访美以后也许才能拿出一个较有新意的方案。
    在这种形势下，苏联乘完成了从阿富汗撤军、自己的形象在阿拉伯世界有所改善之机，派出外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽从２月１７日开始，历访叙利亚、约旦、埃及、伊拉克和伊朗，并在埃及同以色列外长阿伦斯进行会谈，谋求召开国际会议解决中东问题的主导权。他在伊朗得到霍梅尼的接见，在西方因拉什迪事件同伊朗关系趋于恶化之际加强了苏伊关系，在外交上得了不小的一分。
    笔者认为，迄今为止，美苏这些频繁的外交活动，都是为了加强各自的地位。但是，由于是在国际形势趋向缓和的大背景下出现的，所以这些外交角逐也是美苏力求利益平衡的竞争共处格局下的产物。如果美苏都能在照顾自己和对方利益的基础上为世界和地区的和平与发展竞相做更多的事，１９８９年也许是大有希望的一年。
