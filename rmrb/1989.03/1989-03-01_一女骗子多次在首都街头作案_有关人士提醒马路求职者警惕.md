A female con artist in her thirties has repeatedly deceived job-seeking young women from outside Beijing, using her silver tongue to lure them into traps. The police and relevant authorities have warned "street job seekers" to be vigilant and avoid falling victim to such scams.

This female con artist has been operating since last August, using the pretext of job introductions and trips to other provinces to lure several young women from outside Beijing to rural areas in Anhui, where she has made off with their money. Young women from Sichuan, such as Tang, Huang, and Shi, were taken to Anhui and had their freedom restricted, enduring various forms of humiliation.

The con artist's primary operating area is the illegal labor market under the Jian Guo Men Interchange. Li Ruixin, the general manager of the Beijing Three-Eight Home Service Company, confirmed that since the beginning of last year, six young women from outside Beijing have been deceived and taken away. The company, in collaboration with the Beijing Public Security Bureau, has rescued two of these women from Anhui, while the whereabouts of the other four remain unknown.

On January 7 of this year, this notorious con artist was caught while lurking near the Three-Eight Service Company, attempting to commit another crime. However, she soon escaped.

Li Ruixin appeals to young women from outside Beijing who are seeking domestic service jobs in the city to be vigilant and to register with the local Three-Eight Service Companies to prevent being deceived and scammed while waiting for job opportunities in illegal labor markets.

　　一女骗子多次在首都街头作案
    有关人士提醒马路求职者警惕
    本报讯  记者袁建达、李双泰报道：一名三十来岁的女人仅凭三寸不烂之舌，在北京拐骗外地求职女青年频频得手，警方及有关人士告诫“马路求职者”谨防上当。
    这名女骗子自去年８月以来，以介绍工作、到外地游玩等为诱饵，把数名在京求职的外地女青年诱骗到安徽农村，获取横财。四川姑娘唐某、黄某、石某等被拐到安徽后，人身失去自由，遭到百般凌辱。
    这名女骗子的作案场所主要在建国门立交桥下的非法劳务市场。北京市三八家务服务总公司总经理李瑞琴证实，自去年年初以来，已发现６名外地求职女青年被拐骗。这家总公司和北京市公安局密切合作，从安徽解救了其中的２位女青年，另４人下落不明。
    今年１月７日，这名作恶多端的女骗子到三八服务总公司门前伺机作案时，曾被抓获，但不久又伺机逃脱。
    李瑞琴呼吁外地来京寻找家庭服务工作的女青年提高警惕，认真到本市各三八服务公司登记备案，以防在非法劳务市场待聘时上当受骗。
