Product quality is a crucial aspect that many enterprises in developed countries strictly control. This is because high quality is a necessary condition for products to enter the international market.

The quality of products on the contemporary international market not only refers to the various internal performances and external designs of the products, but also includes the usability of the products, as well as the packaging quality. In today's increasingly fierce international market competition, those who possess this modern quality awareness, whose products are both beautiful and affordable, have a greater chance of success. On the other hand, enterprises that disregard consumer interests, use famous brand labels and certificates, but produce substandard goods to cheat customers, are certainly doomed to fail.

In addition to ensuring the product itself is of high quality, good service attitudes and sales techniques also seem to be part of modern enterprise quality awareness. Meeting customers' consumption psychology with enthusiastic and considerate service is, of course, another path to the enterprise's success.

　　要有现代质量意识
    产品质量是发达国家许多企业严格把握的重要一环。因为，高质量是产品进入国际市场的必要条件。
    当代国际市场上的产品质量，不仅指产品内在的各种性能和外观造型，还包括产品的适用性，以及包装质量等。在当今国际市场竞争日趋激烈的形势下，谁具有这种现代质量意识，谁的产品物美价廉，谁取胜的可能性就大。而那些无视消费者利益，挂着名牌商标和合格证，产品却以次充好、坑害顾客的企业，肯定是没有出路的。
    除了产品本身质量过硬外，良好的服务态度和销售技术似乎也是现代企业质量意识的组成部分。以热情、周到的服务去满足顾客的消费心理，当然也是企业的一条成功之道。
