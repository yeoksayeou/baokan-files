The New Authority is Indispensable

Liu Donghua

What is “new authority”? In my understanding, “new authority” refers to the leadership authority in the era of reform and the construction of a new era, which undertakes historical missions. It is not the authority of an autocratic regime itself. “New authority” can only be assumed by “this one” chosen by difficult times, relying on the political acumen and extraordinary wisdom of a statesman; while the old authority of an autocratic regime can be assumed by anyone, blindly bestowing authority on whoever takes the position. Peter the Great of Russia, Emperor Meiji of Japan, and Sun Yat-sen of China, although at different levels, all belong to the former category; the countless incompetent rulers and corrupt officials in the history of Chinese feudalism belong to the latter. The mission of “new authority” is solely to conclude the old era and open a new century, helping a nation and a country to step onto a new level of human civilization.

Whether it is Tang Taizong and Song Taizu, or the prosperous reigns of Kangxi and Qianlong, ultimately, the enlightenment of feudal emperors is only for the purpose of consolidating the autocratic regime and strengthening centralized rule. It is merely a repetition of thousands of years of feudal rule and cannot achieve any qualitative breakthrough. On the contrary, the “enlightened despotism” of “new authoritarianism” implements reforms with an iron fist, ultimately abolishing the autocratic regime, saying goodbye to centralized politics, and achieving economic development and political prosperity.

When it comes to “new authoritarianism,” some people often contrast it with democratic politics, believing that the two are incompatible. In fact, new authoritarianists have awakened from the illusion of democracy and turned to seeking a realistic path to democratic politics. Yes, over the past hundred years, China’s patriots have indeed been striving for the goal of freedom and democracy, facing countless difficulties and obstacles. In the past decade of reform and opening up, more and more people have begun to understand that the coexistence of old and new systems has made the construction of democracy and the rule of law achieve some success, but there are also many difficulties. Today, although everyone from top to bottom is calling for the promotion of democratic politics and strengthening public supervision, who will implement it? Who has the ability to implement it? Who will stop the illegal and disciplinary actions of party and government officials? Who has the ability to stop them? It seems that only by relying on the functions of the law and the supervision of the masses, and relying on the leadership of the Communist Party and the authority formed by its collective wisdom, can we proceed. The stingy old man of history only pushes out the “new authority” that can seize this opportunity after paying enough price. Therefore, if “new authority” politics is a bridge, then it is a bridge that the Chinese nation cannot avoid and must cross.

Crossing the bridge is not easy, but once we safely reach the other side, the bridge will have completed its historical mission and will no longer be necessary. At that time, people will also eliminate their concerns about “new authority”; at the same time, it will also prove that “new authority” politics is in line with the logic of historical development.

### “新权威”不可少

　　“新权威”不可少
    刘东华
    什么是“新权威”？我的理解，“新权威”乃是改革年代、新厦即起之际，承担历史重任的领袖权威，而绝非专制政体本身的权威。“新权威”只能由艰难时势选定的“这一个”来充任，凭仗的只是政治家的雄才大略、超人智慧；而专制政体的旧权威则连稻草人都能胜任，轮到谁就把权威盲目地加在谁身上。俄国的彼得大帝，日本的睦仁天皇，中国的孙中山，虽属不同层次，但均有类于前者；我国封建史上数以百计的昏君佞臣则属于后者。“新权威”的使命，惟在于为旧时代结尾、新世纪开篇，扶持一个民族、一个国家跨上人类文明的新阶梯。
    唐宗宋祖也好，康乾盛世也罢，归根结底，封建帝王的开明不过以巩固专制政体、强化集权统治为目的，不过是几千年封建统治的重复，不可能有任何质的突破；相反，“新权威主义”的“开明专制”则以铁腕作风力行改革，最后摒弃专制政体，以高度集权向集权政治诀别，以实现经济发展、政治繁荣。
    谈到“新权威主义”，一些人还通常把它与民主政治对立起来，认为二者水火不容。事实上，新权威主义者是从民主的幻象中醒了过来，转而致力于寻找一条抵达民主政治的现实通道。是的，近百年来，中国的志士仁人确实一直在为自由民主的目标历尽艰难险阻，十年来的改革开放使越来越多的人开始懂得，新旧体制共存，使得民主、法制建设虽取得一些成就，但困难亦不少，如今尽管上上下下几乎都在喊推进民主政治，喊加强舆论监督，然而，让谁去落实？谁有能力去落实？对于党政干部中的违法违纪行为谁去阻止他们？谁有能力阻止他们？恐怕只有依靠法律的职能和群众的监督，只能依靠共产党的领导和他的集体智慧所形成的权威。吝啬的历史老人是在坐收了足够的代价后，才把能够把握住这个机会的“新权威”推了出来。因此，如果说“新权威”政治是一座桥的话，那么，它是中华民族无以回避、非过不可的桥。
    过桥，是不容易的，而一旦顺利地抵达彼岸，桥也就完成了它的历史任务，没有存在的必要了。那时人们也就消除了对“新权威”的顾虑；同时，也就证明了“新权威”政治是符合历史发展逻辑的。
