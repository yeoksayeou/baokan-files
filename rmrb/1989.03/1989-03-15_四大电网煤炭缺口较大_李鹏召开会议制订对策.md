Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 14th. (Reporter: Lǐ Píngdìng) The issue of power supply shortages, which is currently constraining China's economic development, is expected to ease. On March 13th, Premier Li Peng convened a meeting to address the coal shortages in the Northeast, North China, East China, and Central China power grids, ensuring a stable power supply.

Premier Li Peng emphasized at the meeting that significant efforts must be made to increase national power generation in the second quarter. Particularly, the power generation in the four major grids must be boosted to meet the national plan's requirements for this year.

The meeting determined the following specific measures:

First, for the coal shortages in the four major grids, preferential economic policies will be implemented. The State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Energy will be responsible for coordinating and ensuring coal supply, production, and transportation contracts in each region. For the East China grid, which faces significant issues, coal supply will mainly rely on transporting coal from Shanxi. Railways will accelerate maintenance, and water transport will increase capacity. Coal mines that have not reached their planned production capacity due to various reasons must quickly achieve their production goals.

Second, the four major grids must take effective measures to ensure safe operation, particularly focusing on the safe production of key power plants. All regions and departments should consider the overall situation and, according to the requirements of economic restructuring, prioritize ensuring power supply for key enterprises in transportation, energy, and raw materials. The State Planning Commission and the Ministry of Energy will jointly dispatch power usage supervision teams to strictly supervise the implementation of power usage plans by each grid.

Third, relevant departments will formulate regulations for power dispatch management, strengthening the legal and transparent nature of power dispatch management to facilitate public supervision. For the current illegal resale of coal for power generation to gain excessive profits, relevant authorities will investigate and severely punish the involved units and individuals.

The heads of the State Planning Commission, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Communications, Ministry of Materials, and the State Price Bureau attended the meeting.

　　四大电网煤炭缺口较大  李鹏召开会议制订对策
    据新华社北京３月１４日电  （记者李安定）成为我国当前经济发展制约因素的电力供应紧缺问题可望缓解。３月１３日，国务院总理李鹏召开会议，就解决东北、华北、华东、华中四大电网煤炭缺口，确保电力供应作出安排。
    李鹏总理在会上指出，要下大力气在第二季度把全国发电量增加上去。特别是要把四大电网的发电量抓上去，力争达到今年国家计划要求的水平。
    会议确定采取以下具体措施：
    一、对于四大电网所需煤炭出现的缺口问题，采取优惠的经济政策，由国家计委和能源部负责，分地区逐片落实，实行计划、生产、运输合同一本账。对问题较大的华东电网，煤炭供应主要依靠晋煤外运，铁路要加速维修，水运要增加运力，因各种原因没有达到计划的煤矿要尽快达到生产能力。
    二、四大电网要采取有效措施，确保安全运行，特别是抓好主力电厂的安全生产。各地区、各部门应该顾全大局，根据经济结构调整的要求，优先保证交通、能源、原材料等重点企业用电。国家计委、能源部要联合派出用电监督小组，严格监督各电网执行用电计划。
    三、责成有关部门制订电力调度管理条例，加强电力调度管理的法制化、公开化，以便于群众监督。对于当前非法转手倒卖发电用煤，牟取暴利的单位和个人，要组织力量，核查清楚，严肃处理。
    国家计委、能源部、铁道部、交通部、物资部和国家物价局负责人出席了这次会议。
