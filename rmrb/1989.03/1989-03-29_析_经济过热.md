	Analyzing "Economic Overheating"

	Eagerness for quick results and an overheated mind are indeed important reasons for the frequent mistakes in our economic construction.

	Some people regard economic overheating as a problem that universally exists at present, as a phenomenon that universally exists in the entire economic domain, which is not convincing.

	Is the agriculture, which serves as the foundation of the national economy, and the grain, cotton, and oil that have stagnated for many years, overheated?

	Are the energy, transportation, telecommunications, and raw material industries that seriously constrain the development of the national economy overheated?

	Is the scientific and technological endeavor, which is the primary productive force, and the educational cause overheated?

	If it is overheated, it must be cooled down and suppressed.

	Whether the above-mentioned sectors are overheated or overcooled, whether they need to be cooled down or warmed up, whether they need to be suppressed or strengthened, should be easy to determine.

	Of course, in some other sectors, the phenomenon of overheating indeed exists seriously.

	Blindly expanding the construction scale of processing industries, pursuing production value and quantity one-sidedly, competing with each other in construction speed;

	Indiscriminately building non-production facilities such as halls, pavilions, and institutions, especially too many high-end hotels and restaurants that are detached from China's actual life;

	Confusing government and enterprise, official and business, and the emergence of many illegal trading companies that seek excessive profits, which corrupt social ethics and cause great chaos in the circulation field;

	Consumption desires are too high, consumption demand grows too fast, group purchasing power is out of control, and the import of high-end sedans and such materials is too much, etc.

	These overheating phenomena fuel inflation and price increases, so they must be cooled down and suppressed, and swift and decisive measures must be taken.

	Following the trend, adopting a one-size-fits-all approach, and blindly following others will result in supporting one side while neglecting the other, or one tendency covering another. Solving complex economic problems can only be done by adopting a scientific analytical attitude, clarifying which sectors are overheated, which are overcooled, which need to be suppressed, and which need to be maintained, in order to reverse short-term behaviors, increase effective supply, and implement the policies of rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform, ensuring the stable development of the economy.

	Our mistakes, I am afraid, should be found more in macro-level decision-making.

### 析“经济过热”

　　析“经济过热”
    急于求成，头脑过热，确实是我们经济建设屡犯错误的重要原因。
    有些人把经济过热当作目前普遍存在的问题，当作整个经济领域普遍存在的现象，则不足以服人。
    难道作为国民经济基础的农业，徘徊了多年的粮、棉、油，是过热吗？
    当前严重制约国民经济发展的能源、交通、电讯和原材料工业，是过热吗？
    作为第一生产力的科学技术和教育事业，是过热吗？
    过热，就得降温，就要抑制。
    上述部门，是过热，还是过冷，是降温，还是升温，是抑制，还是强化，应该说是不难搞清楚的。
    当然，在另一些部门，过热现象也确实严重存在。
    盲目扩大加工工业的建设规模，片面追求产值、产量，互相攀比建设速度；
    滥盖非生产性的楼、堂、馆、所，特别是脱离我国现实生活的高级宾馆、高级饭店搞得过多；
    政企不分、官商不分、非法倒买倒卖，牟取暴利的公司一哄而起，败坏了社会风气，造成了流通领域的极大混乱；
    消费欲望过高，消费需求增长过快，集团购买力失控，进口高级小轿车这类物资过多等等。
    这些过热现象，助长了通货膨胀和物价上涨，因此应当降温，应当抑制，而且要快刀斩乱麻，令行禁止。
    刮风，搞一刀切，人云亦云，其后果是扶得东来西又倒，或者是一种倾向掩盖另一种倾向。解决复杂的经济问题，只能采取科学分析的态度，弄清哪些热，哪些冷，哪些该压，哪些该保，才能扭转短期行为，增加有效供应，才能实现治理、整顿和深化改革的方针，保证经济稳定的发展。
    我们的失误，恐怕要多从宏观决策上找原因。
