The deepest source of power for Chinese agriculture lies within the hundreds of millions of farmers. Whether they are active or passive is crucial to the strength of the agricultural foundation. Exploring a path that can sustainably motivate farmers to release their maximum potential is key to gaining a powerful driving force for strengthening the agricultural foundation.

In my view, this path can be summarized as: cooperative specialization + intensive family farm operations. To achieve the ultimate goal of commercialization, socialization, and modernization of Chinese agriculture, based on the initial stage of socialism and drawing on domestic and international experiences, it is universally meaningful to develop intensive family farm operations of various kinds on the basis of improving the responsibility system for household contract operations. What is meant by family farm operations is the adoption of modern enterprise management methods for various types of family farms, including planting, livestock, horticulture, and so on. These can be specialized large households, specialized joint households, or family farms within state farms, etc. Various types of family farm operations are independent, have clear property rights, are self-reliant, and are connected to the market, possessing the status of legal entities. This is a model that is both suitable for moderate-scale operations and adapts to the characteristics of agriculture.

Since nature intervenes in the agricultural production process, agriculture has characteristics such as seasonality, risk, and precision. If the scale of agricultural operations is too large, even adopting a large-scale centralized management form, it will not only lead to reduced land output due to coarse cultivation but also make it difficult to adapt to the characteristics of agriculture due to the inability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Historical experience has repeatedly proven that large-scale agricultural enterprises built with huge state investments and managed by officials, such as chicken farms with ten thousand birds, pig farms with ten thousand heads, cattle farms with a thousand heads, and farms with a hundred acres, should not be the universal path for the development of China's agricultural productivity. Such large-scale agricultural enterprises are also rare in Western European countries with high levels of agricultural modernization. The average size of a farm in France is 382.5 acres, in Ireland 337.5 acres, in West Germany 260 acres, in the Netherlands 217.5 acres, and in Belgium 204 acres. In China, where agricultural productivity is still low, developing family farm operations is a form of development that fully utilizes the advantages of family operations, has low investment, and high output.

People might ask, does adopting the form of family farm operations hinder large-scale operations and agricultural modernization? The answer is no. Even in highly developed economies, the form of family farms still has strong vitality. Here, two points need to be clarified: first, modern family farm operations are not the same as traditional small-scale farming; second, appropriate scale operations in agriculture are relative and should be determined based on objective conditions. In the current stage of China's rural areas, a family breeding farm raising dozens, or even two to three hundred, pigs, hundreds or even two to three thousand poultry, and dozens or even a hundred to two hundred dairy cows is already considered to have a certain scale. As for the scale of a family planting farm, in the Northeast region, operating ten to twenty hectares of cultivated land, and in the south, planting two to three hectares or more is also considerable. Undoubtedly, such scale family farms and breeding farms can fully adopt modern production methods and advanced technological equipment to improve the level of agricultural specialization, socialization, and commercialization.

The necessary condition for the widespread development of family farm operations is to establish and improve a cooperative system that provides specialized services. The cooperative system mentioned here is completely different from the traditional centralized and collectivized cooperative system, which concentrates land, labor, and large machinery and adopts collective labor methods. The rural cooperative system that needs to be established and improved is a farmer cooperative organization that adheres to the principles of self-governance, autonomy, and self-help, serves farmers, and promotes their economic development, and operates on the principles of democracy, equality, voluntariness, and mutual benefit. Its function is to undertake the specialized services commonly needed by family farm operations. Various specialized cooperative organizations form a service network for family farm operations and become a link between farmers and the market, industry, and agriculture.

The development path of cooperative specialization + intensive family farm operations is not only a complete negation of the traditional cooperative model of collectivization but also a perfection of the great achievement of rural reform—the household contract responsibility system. This development model has the advantages of moderate scale, flexibility, and quick adaptability, while maintaining the adaptability of fine farming in traditional Chinese agriculture, and creates a mechanism to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm, initiative, and self-investment. It will truly turn agriculture into the business of hundreds of millions of farmers and may become a new path for the development of Chinese socialist agriculture.

### 探索强化农业基础的新路

　　探索强化农业基础的新路
    中国农业最深厚的动力蕴藏在几亿农民之中。他们是积极还是消极，攸关农业基础的强弱。探索一条能持久激励农民释放出最大能量的农业发展道路，就能获得强化农业基础的雄厚动力。
    我的看法，这条道路可以概括为：合作化专业服务＋集约化农民家庭企业经营。为实现我国农业商品化、社会化和现代化的最终目标，从社会主义初级阶段国情和吸取国内外经验出发，在完善农业联产承包制的基础上，发展集约化经营的各类农民家庭企业是有普遍意义的事情。所谓农民家庭企业，是采用现代企业经营方式的种植、畜牧、园艺等各类农民家庭农场。它们可以是专业大户，专业联户，或国营农场中的家庭农场等。各种农民家庭企业，都是独立自主、产权明晰、自负盈亏、连接市场、具有法人地位的农业基本单位和微观主体。这是一个既利于适度规模经营，又适于农业特点的发展模式。
    由于自然介入了农业生产过程，因而使农业具有季节、风险性和精细性等特点。如果农业经营规模过大，甚至采取庞大的集中化经营形式，不仅会因耕作粗放而降低土地产出率，而且会因顾此失彼而难于适应农业的特点。历史经验一再证明，靠国家花巨资建设、派官员经管的十万只鸡场、万头猪场、千头牛场、百顷农场等大型农业企业，不应成为我国农业生产力发展的普遍道路。这种大型农业企业，在西欧农业现代化水平很高的国家里也不多见。法国平均每个农场的种植面积３８２．５亩，爱尔兰为３３７．５亩，西德为２６０亩，荷兰为２１７．５亩，比利时为２０４亩。在农业生产力尚低的我国，发展农民家庭企业是一条充分发挥家庭经营优势、投入低而产出高的发展形式。
    人们的反问可能是，采取农民家庭企业形式，岂不阻碍规模经营和农业现代化？回答是否定的。不要说在经济还很落后的我国，就是在经济高度发达的国家里，农民家庭农场形式依然具有强大生命力。这里需要明确二点：一是现代农民家庭农场经营不等于传统小农经济；二是农业适度规模经营是相对的，应依据客观条件而决定。在现阶段的我国农村，一座家庭饲养场，养数十头、乃至二、三百头生猪，养数百只乃至二三千只家禽，养数十头乃至一二百头奶牛已算初具规模了。至于一个农民家庭种植场的规模，在东北地区经营一二十公顷耕地，在南方种植二三公顷或再多些也算可观了。毫无疑问，这样规模的农民家庭农场和饲养场，完全可以采用现代生产方式和先进技术设备，提高农业专业化、社会化和商品化水平。
    普遍发展农民家庭企业的必要条件是健全和完善提供专业化服务的合作制。这里所说合作制，完全区别于那种集中化、集体化的传统合作制，即把土地、劳力、大机具等集中起来、采用集体劳动方式的那种农业合作化。现在要健全和完善的农村合作制，是以自治、自主、自助为方针，以为农民服务和促进其经济发展为宗旨，以民主、平等、自愿、互利为原则的农民合作组织。它的职能是承担农民家庭企业所共同需要的专业化服务。各种专业合作组织形成为农民家庭企业提供服务的网络，成为连接农民和市场、工业和农业的纽带。
    合作化专业服务＋集约化农民家庭企业经营的发展道路，既是对合作化等于集中化的传统合作制模式的彻底否定，又是对农村改革的伟大成果——家庭联产承包责任制的完善。这种发展模式，既具有适度规模、灵活、快速的随机应变性，又保持我国传统农业中精耕细作的应变性，还创造一种激发农民积极性、主动性和自我投入的动力机制。它将把农业真正变成几亿农民的事业，很可能成为我国社会主义农业发展的一条新路。
