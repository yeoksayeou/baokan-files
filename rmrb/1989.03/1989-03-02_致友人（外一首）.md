To a Friend (and Another Poem)

To a Friend

You are a sculpture that stands tall,
Cold and stern like cliffs and glaciers.
The sun melts the frost from your eyelashes,
A new horizon corrects your gaze.
How many tender seedlings
Have you nurtured with your heart's water?
How many nameless farmers
Have you lifted up, elevating them to
Stars in the night sky?
Your heart is a ship, carrying
Authors, readers, soldiers, generals,
Cities and villages.
Against the wind and waves, you sail forward,
Panning for gold in the sand.
Though you are carefree and composed,
You have worn out several pairs of iron shoes.
The gold you mine, with
Brilliant autumn leaves, composes
A song of a rugged autumn path.

Olive Tree

A distant, unfamiliar love,
A seed carried by a migratory bird,
Petals of many colors fluttering,
Beyond the mountains and the sea,
The sun and moon's glow surges,
Bathing you in pure fragrance.
Even if time leaves too many blanks,
When we meet, we will still smile brightly.
In mid-autumn,
You still hold onto spring.

    致友人（外一首）
    晨梅
    是仰视的雕塑
    冷峻的巉岩冰川
    是太阳融化了冰封的眼睫
    是新的风景线
    矫正了你的视点
    多少稚嫩的幼苗
    是你用心泉浇灌
    多少无名的耕者
    是你的双手托起　升华为
    夜幕的新星
    你的心是船　装着
    作者读者士兵将军
    装着都市村庄
    顺风逆浪扬帆向前
    沙里淘金
    虽潇洒从容　也　
    磨破了几双铁鞋
    你挖掘的金子伴着
    绚烂的落叶　谱写了
    一曲曲坎坷的金秋路
    　　　　橄榄树
    渺茫的爱
    陌生而遥远
    飞鸿衔去一颗种子
    五彩花瓣纷纷扬扬
    山和海的那边
    涌动日月岚光
    沐浴你素洁芬芳
    纵然岁月留下太多空白
    相见时仍会嫣然一笑
    仲秋时分
    依然挽着春天
