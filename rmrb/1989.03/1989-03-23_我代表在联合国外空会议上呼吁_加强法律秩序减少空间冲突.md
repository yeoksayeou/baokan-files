	UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Chinese delegation, He Qi Zhi, today called for strengthening the legal order in outer space at the 28th session of the Legal Subcommittee of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. He said this would promote the development of outer space activities.

	He Qi Zhi welcomed the recent proposal by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space to designate 1992 as the International Space Year.

	He Qi Zhi said, "The formulation of legal norms for the management of outer space activities and the development of international space law are of great significance in promoting the development of space activities, reducing space conflicts, and thereby promoting international cooperation and trust, as well as peace and security for mankind."

	The issue of the use of nuclear power sources in outer space is a central issue in space law.

    本报联合国３月２２日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国代表团团长贺其治今天在联合国外空委法律分委会第２８届会议上呼吁加强外空法律秩序，以促进外空活动的发展。
    贺其治对外空委科技分委会最近建议１９９２年为国际空间年表示欢迎。
    贺其治说，“制定管理外空活动的法律准则，发展国际空间法，对于推动空间事业的发展，减少空间冲突，从而促进国际合作和信任以及人类的和平与安全，有着极其重要的意义”。
    外空使用核动力源问题，是空间法的一个中心问题，贺其治表示中国对此问题十分关注，要求在严格的基础上制定保证在外空使用核动力源的安全规章，因为一旦发生事故，任何国家都可能受到影响。
