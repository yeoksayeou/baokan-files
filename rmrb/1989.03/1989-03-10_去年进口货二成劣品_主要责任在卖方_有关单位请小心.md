	Last year, the proportion of substandard imported goods in China has been increasing, reaching approximately 21% in 1988. This issue should alert relevant parties to be more vigilant.

	According to Zhu Zhenyuan, the Director of the State Administration of Commodity Inspection, 1988 saw the inspection of over 70,000 batches of imported goods, with 15,900 batches found to be substandard. Mechanical and electrical products had the most prominent quality issues, while some imported timber, wool, and rubber also exhibited problems such as poor quality, adulteration, and shortages. It is understood that last year, the commodity inspection department issued certificates and demanded compensation from foreign sellers totaling approximately $100 million.

	Zhu Zhenyuan also revealed that to enhance the quality of inspections for imported and exported goods, the Chinese commodity inspection department has, in recent years, sent personnel to participate in product quality inspections in nearly 20 countries, including Japan, the United States, and the Federal Republic of Germany. Currently, preparations are being made to establish a joint inspection agency in the Federal Republic of Germany.

　　去年进口货二成劣品
    主要责任在卖方　有关单位请小心
    本报讯  记者陆振华报道：国家商检局局长朱震元３月８日向记者透露，近年来我国进口商品中不合格比例呈上升趋势，去年约达２１％，应引起有关各方警惕。
    朱震元说，１９８８年，我国商检部门累计检验进口商品７万多批，不合格批次达１．５９万批。其中，机电产品质量问题最为突出，一些进口木材、羊毛、橡胶等货物也存在质次掺假数量短缺等现象。据了解，去年经商检部门出证，先后向外商索取赔款约１亿美元。
    朱震元还透露，为提高进出口商品检验质量，中国商检部门近年来已派员到日本、美国、联邦德国等近２０个国家参与商品质量检验，目前正准备在联邦德国成立联合检验机构。
