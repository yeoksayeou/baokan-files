	Soviet delegation head Oleg Grinevsky on March 10 emphasized again at the second plenary session of the talks on confidence-building and security measures in Europe that, in order to increase military transparency, the Soviet Union still insists on including naval and air forces in the negotiation scope. The situation where the agreement on monitoring troop movements reached in Stockholm in 1986 did not include naval and air forces must be corrected.

	Grinevsky believes that the navy, especially aircraft carriers, "has obvious offensive characteristics." When necessary, these warships deployed in European waters can launch attacks on land. NATO has consistently opposed the inclusion of naval and air forces in the talks on confidence-building and security measures.

	The Warsaw Pact insists on its demands based on the fact that the "Final Document" of the Madrid follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe stipulates that "confidence-building and security measures include the entire European continent and the adjacent sea and air spaces." The talks on confidence-building and security measures are held in accordance with the provisions of the final document of the Madrid follow-up meeting.

	It is reported that, in addition to the Warsaw Pact countries, Iceland, Cyprus, Malta, and the Nordic countries of Finland, Sweden, and Norway have also requested the inclusion of naval forces in the negotiations.

　　苏联代表团团长强调
    海空军纳入谈判
    新华社维也纳３月１０日电  （记者肖力）苏联代表团团长奥列格·格里涅夫斯基１０日在欧洲建立信任和安全措施谈判第二次全体会议后再次强调，为了增加军事透明度，苏联仍然要求将海军和空军力量纳入谈判范围。１９８６年在斯德哥尔摩达成的有关部队调动监督协议没有包括海、空军的情况必须得到纠正。
    格里涅夫斯基认为，海军、尤其是航空母舰“具有明显的进攻性质”，必要时，这些部署在欧洲海域的军舰可以向陆地发起进攻。北约一直反对将海、空军纳入建立信任和安全措施的谈判。
    华约坚持其要求的根据是，欧安会马德里续会《最后文件》规定，“建立信任和安全措施包括整个欧洲以及与此相邻的海域和空间”。建立信任和安全措施谈判就是根据马德里续会最后文件的规定举行的。
    据报道，迄今除华约国家以外，还有冰岛、塞浦路斯、马耳他以及北欧的芬兰、瑞典和挪威都曾要求将海军力量纳入谈判。
