Soviet women's volleyball coach Karpol believes that until the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, the world women's volleyball landscape with Cuba, the Soviet Union, China, and Peru as the top four will not change.

This is what Karpol recently said in an interview with a local newspaper. The coach also divided the current top 12 women's volleyball teams in the world into three levels, believing that Cuba, the Soviet Union, China, and Peru belong to the first level. Currently, the Soviet women's volleyball team is at its peak and is the strongest among the top four.

The second level includes Japan, East Germany, the United States, and Brazil. These four teams have similar levels and can potentially defeat teams from the first level, but winning any international major tournament is quite challenging. South Korea, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Italy belong to the third level.

　　苏女排教练卡尔波尔认为        
    世界女排格局四年不会变
    新华社哈瓦那３月２０日电  苏联女排教练卡尔波尔认为，直到１９９２年巴塞罗那奥运会，古巴、苏联、中国和秘鲁为世界女排四强的格局将不会改变。
    这是卡尔波尔最近接受此间报纸记者时说的。这位教练还把目前世界女子排坛１２支强队分成３个级别，认为古巴、苏联、中国和秘鲁队属第一个级别。目前苏联女排正处于鼎盛时期，是四强之首。
    第二个级别的队包括日本、民主德国、美国和巴西。这４个队水平相当接近，也有可能击败第一级别中的队，但要取得任何一次国际大赛的胜利困难不小。南朝鲜、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和意大利４个队属于第三级别。
