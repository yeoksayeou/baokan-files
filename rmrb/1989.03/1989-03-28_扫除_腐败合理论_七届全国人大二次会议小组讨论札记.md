	Sweeping Away the "Theory of Inevitable Corruption"
		—Notes from the Small Group Discussions of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress

	By Yuán Jiàndá, Reporter for this paper

	Interviewing deputies and attending small group discussions, I found that anti-corruption remains a hot topic among the deputies.

	Wang Tíngdòng, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, said: "Some people think that corruption is a direct result of reform and opening up, that prosperity inevitably brings corruption, and that we should first have corruption and then deal with it. Thus, the standard for clean governance seems to be lowered, and even the clean behavior of cadres is called 'orthodox conservatism,' while the unclean behavior is considered a minor issue."

	Although there are only a few cadres with corrupt behavior, there are many who are diligent in their work and selfless in their service. However, once the "theory of inevitable corruption" forms an underground public opinion and an internal norm, its danger cannot be underestimated. "This is not an exaggeration," said Nuè Róngguì, Deputy Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee. He said that in some places, clean cadres are isolated and attacked, the network of relationships cannot be broken, and corruption cannot be stopped, all because of this so-called "theory."

	To build a "big environment" for clean governance, let cadres and the masses understand and accept clean governance, and corruption will become a target of public criticism and will collapse on its own. Jiangxi Vice Governor Jiǎng Zhùpíng advocates strengthening education and propaganda to eliminate the market for the "theory of inevitable corruption"; Shū Shèng, Mayor of Jingdezhen City, calls for high-level cadres to lead by example and for powerful cadres to be strict with themselves; rural teacher Táo Yùlán hopes that cadres at all levels will strengthen their party spirit and legal awareness and not let the corrupt philosophy of life, disguised in colorful wrappings, blind their eyes.

	In recent years, everyone has been busy with construction and speed, and ideological and political work has been neglected. This is of course due to propaganda, but more importantly, it is due to the lack of a sound system, ineffective measures, and weak supervision. Ershan Vice Governor Wáng Shuāngxī asked: "Why does the 'theory of inevitable corruption' still have a market? It is because many of our systems are not sound and perfect."

	Nuè Róngguì proposed a suggestion: When formulating policies and guidelines, we should fully consider the possible derived problems and formulate corresponding regulations to avoid a pile of problems to be "managed" later. He said, on the issue of clean governance, we cannot hesitate any longer.

　　扫除“腐败合理论”        
    ——七届全国人大二次会议小组讨论札记
    本报记者  袁建达
    采访人大代表，旁听小组讨论，我发现，廉政，仍是代表们议论的热点。
    山西省人大常委会主任王庭栋说：“有人认为，腐败现象是改革开放直接带来的，同外国一样，繁荣就得腐败，先腐败后治理。于是，现在廉洁标准似乎要降低了，甚至把干部廉洁行为说成‘正统保守’，把不廉洁反而当作小节。”
    有腐败行为的干部毕竟是极少数，勤政为业、克己奉公的大有人在。但是，“腐败合理论”一旦形成一股地下的社会舆论，一种内部准则，它的危险就不可低估了。“这绝非危言耸听。”云南省委副书记聂荣贵说，现在有的地方廉洁干部受孤立、遭打击，关系网冲不破，腐败现象禁不绝，就是这种不是理论的“理论”在起作用。
    建设廉政的“大气候”，让干部和群众都来理解廉政、接受廉政，腐败现象便会成为众矢之的，不攻自破。江西省副省长蒋祝平主张加强教育、加强宣传，扫除“腐败合理论”的市场；景德镇市市长舒圣估呼吁高层干部以身作则，实权干部严以律己；乡村教师陶玉兰则希望各级干部加强党性和法制观念，不要让包上花花绿绿伪装的腐败处世哲学蒙住了自己的双眼。
    这几年，上上下下忙建设、忙速度，思想政治工作被忽视了，这当然有宣传上的原因，但更主要的是制度不健全、措施不得力，监督欠有力。陕西省副省长王双锡问：“为什么‘腐败合理论’还有一定的市场？就是因为我们的许多制度不健全、不完善。”
    聂荣贵提出一条建议是：在制定政策和方针时，要充分考虑到可能派生的问题，并制定相应的规定，以免问题成堆再去“治理”。他说，在廉政问题上，我们不能再犹豫了。
