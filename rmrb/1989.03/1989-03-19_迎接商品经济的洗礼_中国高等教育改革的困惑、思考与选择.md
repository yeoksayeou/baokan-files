In 1895, Sheng Xuanhuai, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, established the Tianjin Middle-Western Academy. In 1898, the Qing government set up the Imperial University. Thus began modern higher education in China.

This was an event that occurred at the turn of the last century. The educational reform, which included "abolishing the imperial examination system and promoting schools," accelerated the disintegration of the traditional society that had lasted for two thousand years and guided a genuine social revolution.

As we approach the 21st century, at the turn of a new century, we are undergoing a more profound and extensive educational reform. This will drive China towards a modern society.

**Crisis in the Best of Times**

The reform of higher education in the 1980s has been arduous.

In the autumn of 1987, two years after the issuance of the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Educational System Reform," after several small disturbances in the student movements had subsided, the optimistic early reform attempts at Shanghai Jiaotong University and others gradually faded away. Almost all universities across the country experienced the phenomenon of graduates being returned for reallocation, with over 5,000 people having to undergo second or third rounds of allocation. Although this is a small number, in a country lacking in talent and under the "guaranteed allocation" system, this can be seen as a harbinger of unusual changes.

One wave had not yet subsided when another rose. In the spring of 1988, as representatives of the "Two Sessions" (the Seventh National People's Congress and the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference) were loudly calling for insufficient educational funding, almost all universities across the country were embroiled in the bitter-sweet experiences of "paid social services." The days of university presidents were indeed tough: relying on state allocations, Tsinghua University had a deficit of 800 million yuan, Peking University had a deficit of 1 billion yuan, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics had a deficit of 700 million yuan, and Guangzhou University had a deficit of 60 million yuan... University presidents, plagued by fiscal deficits, had to focus on "economic income."

With the arrival of the scorching summer, the trend of commercialization swept through university campuses. The student coffee shop at Renmin University of China and the commercial first floor of Beijing Normal University were famous in Beijing; teachers selling snacks, PhD students setting up stalls, and university students becoming campus individual entrepreneurs were no longer news.

A trend of disdain for learning was quietly spreading.

A teacher from the Philosophy Department at Renmin University of China told the reporter that during her lectures, students started from the last row, and when asked why, they replied: "It's convenient to slip out." In some classes, students took turns attending lectures, with one person designated to take notes, while the rest pursued "sideline businesses." When asked why there was still one person taking notes, they replied: "To pass the exams."

A survey of 30,000 university students in Shanghai found that only 1/4 were studying seriously.

Last year, Hangzhou University expelled several students, and the expelled students actually held a banquet to thank their teachers.

In 1987, 700 postgraduates dropped out, and in 1988, the number reached over 900. Last autumn, an institute at Northeastern University of Technology planned to enroll 10 postgraduates but only managed to admit 4, and in the end, only one showed up. Renmin University of China enrolled one master's student last year, but the student did not report, instead reporting to the Tourism Bureau to become a guide.

The "new theory of uselessness of studying" suddenly emerged.

More worrisome than the few students who disdained learning was the few teachers who disdained teaching. According to estimates by education circles in the capital, about 1/3 of university teachers were not fully focused on teaching. The loss of young teachers was also becoming a problem. A PhD graduate from Peking University firmly refused to stay at the university and became the manager of a restaurant.

In the universities of the capital, a new sarcastic saying circulated: "Look at you, poor as a professor, stupid as a PhD."

These sudden messages from the higher education sector stirred up a wave of "national worries" and plunged many into confusion. People were asking: What exactly is wrong with China's education?

Some people concluded: We are facing an "educational crisis." Others, however, believed: Our education is in the best period in history.

Those who held the latter view also presented their evidence. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, China's educational undertakings have developed rapidly. From 1977 to 1988, the number of ordinary universities increased from 404 to 1,075; the number of enrollments increased from 273,000 to 669,700; the number of students exceeded 2 million. Such a rate of development is not only unprecedented in China's educational history but also rare in the world. What is particularly noteworthy is that the development of higher education has been progressing with the process of reform and opening up, and the entire process from enrollment, training to allocation has already or is undergoing a series of reforms.

Two views, each holding one end, which is right and which is wrong?

The reporter, for this reason, visited a large number of experts in the education sector, officials from educational administrative departments, and researchers from educational research institutions. The reporter also conducted investigations and interviews in some famous universities from north to south. During the investigation, a new perspective gradually became clear.

Professor Chen Minheng, President of East China University of Chemical Technology, believes: "All the confusions currently encountered in university reforms are essentially the conflict between two mechanisms during the transition from socialist product economy to socialist commodity economy, a difficulty in progress."

Indeed, China has a tradition of valuing education, but education in the feudal era had almost only one purpose: to cultivate officials for the feudal dynasty. Especially from the Sui and Tang dynasties to the late Qing dynasty, the imperial examination system made becoming an official the only way to succeed through education. Due to the separation of education from the economy and technology, despite the two-thousand-year tradition of valuing education, it still led to the decline of modern times. Therefore, the transition of traditional Chinese education to modern education at the end of the last century was a historic progress for the Chinese nation.

However, the origin of modern education in China is quite different from that of Europe and America. For example, modern higher education in Britain was a direct product of the Industrial Revolution, a call from the internal dynamics of economic development and the market. While China's modern education was, after the Self-Strengthening Movement, like machines and warships, transplanted from the outside. It cultivated a large number of talents for the modernization of China, but due to the lack of a solid economic foundation and the constant threat of national crisis, it could not have a healthy development in the first half of this century.

The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 opened a glorious chapter in China's educational history. With the rapid advancement of industrialization, the educational cause achieved unprecedented development. In a few years, education provided the country with millions of specialized talents, becoming an important intellectual foundation for the construction of the republic. The batch of intellectuals cultivated by New China is still one of the pillars of our national cause, and their achievements in the educational cause of New China are undeniable.

However, due to the choice of the product economy model for the entire national economic system, higher education, after the adjustment of departments and faculties, was quickly incorporated into the highly centralized planned track. A prominent feature of this educational system is the state's comprehensive management, from the establishment of schools, the setting of majors, investment and allocation of funds to the enrollment and allocation of students, all relying on the state's plan. "Uniformity in schools, uniformity in textbooks," equating the cultivation of talents with the production of machine parts. This "product" model hindered the development of individuality, the old educational system affected the vitality of schools, teachers, and students, leading to the rigidity of teaching and the stagnation of educational productivity. Added to this was the "class struggle as the main course" in universities starting from the early 1960s, developing into the catastrophe of the Cultural Revolution, several upheavals, making higher education on the verge of collapse. The old educational system, along with the product economy, hit a wall in history.

After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, China underwent a fundamental turn. With the great success of rural economic reforms, urban economic reforms were fully launched, gradually clarifying the target model of reforms, which is to abandon the old system of product economy and establish a new system of socialist planned commodity economy. Especially in recent years, urban and rural markets are developing rapidly, and commodity production is stirring the entire society.

Education was one of the earliest areas to "rectify the chaos and return to normalcy," and the call to value education spread from the campuses after the Cultural Revolution to the entire society. However, the emphasis on education at that time was basically to restore the educational model of the 17 years before the Cultural Revolution. Following this line of thought, the "educational revival" also repeated the drawbacks of the old educational system under the product economy.

There is an interesting comparison. In 1958, the peak of higher education development in the 17 years before the Cultural Revolution, some called it the "education explosion": that year, 860 new universities were established, and the number of students increased by 2/3 compared to the previous year. Due to far exceeding the national capacity, it had to be adjusted down later. This "explosion" was indeed related to the erroneous guiding ideology of the "Great Leap Forward," but the more intrinsic reason lay in the mechanism of running schools, which only needed the approval of higher authorities and was not subject to social and market verification. While the state only allocated funds based on the scale and number of enrollments of schools, this stimulated universities to pursue scale and size.

Unexpectedly, in the mid-1980s, another "explosion" occurred. In just 1985, 114 new (including upgraded) universities were established nationwide, averaging 3 to 4 new universities per week. Originally, the national talent structure was unreasonable, with a severe shortage of intermediate and senior technical talents, but some vocational and technical colleges were competing to upgrade. Because after upgrading to a university, the school leaders could be promoted, the teachers' promotion rates increased, and the funds and job prospects were all taken care of by the state, why not? The out-of-control development of universities in 1985 had multiple causes, completely different from the brain fever of 1958, but their root cause was the old system of product economy.

Due to the constraints of internal and external environments, the reform of the educational system has been slow to catch up with the pace of economic system reform. This has created a gap: the tide of commodity economy suddenly surged to the walls of the university, and everything in the campus has not yet adapted to the external changes. All contradictions and confusions arise from this.

If this is called an "educational crisis," then this "crisis" precisely provides the impetus and opportunity for reform. As long as it is guided properly, the "crisis" can be turned into "vitality."

China's higher education will undergo a new transformation in the tide of commodity economy. This is the second major transition in China's educational history of several thousand years. It is brewing a new change in the civilization of the Chinese nation. In this sense, China's educational cause is indeed in the best period in history, truly!

**System: Collision Inside and Outside the Walls**

A thought-provoking question: Why, after more than 30 years of building a vast educational system in China, is it still difficult to produce educators?

A university president told the reporter that the direction of the school gate and the size of the toilet holes are not something he can manage; they have to be approved by the educational administrative department according to the construction plan. As for what departments the school should set up, what majors, what courses, how many teachers, how many students to enroll... there is still a unified plan to manage.

Under the old system, universities were merely appendages of the educational administrative department, not a genuine social entity. They had no autonomy and were powerless to determine their own fate.

The reform of universities, like the reform of the economic system, began with decentralization. A responsible comrade from the Policy Research Office of the State Education Commission told the reporter that now the commission, except for the approval of new universities and the formulation of university major catalogs, has delegated all powers downwards, and there is nothing more to delegate. Some powers, such as planning, financial, and personnel powers, are not in the hands of the commission but are held by the planning, financial, and personnel departments, and we are powerless. However, university presidents are still complaining about the lack of autonomy, what is the reason?

The person in charge of the Teaching Department of the Guangdong Provincial Higher Education Bureau said that the State Education Commission has delegated the management power of some universities to the provinces or ministries. How do the provinces manage? They still manage in the same way as the commission used to.

The university presidents said that delegating management power to the provinces or ministries only adds a more incompetent "mother-in-law" for us.

Under the product economy system, everything in the university was taken care of by the superiors, sleeping in the warm cradle of the state, although there was no autonomy, no educators were produced, but it was comfortable. The problem is that the product economy is rapidly disintegrating, and the market suddenly pushes competition and risk in front of the presidents, whether it is educational funding or the allocation of graduates, the state can no longer take full responsibility. Presidents call for autonomy, almost calling for the right to survive.

President Luo Zhengqi of Shenzhen University said, "Universities should become independent educational entities, have legal person status, and be able to survive and develop in the social environment of commodity economy."

Professor Chen Minheng, President of East China University of Chemical Technology, believes that the goal of university reform is to establish a running mechanism that adapts to the commodity economy, and it can be imagined that society and the market will become the true "superiors" of universities. Of course, in modern society, universities cannot completely detach themselves from the macro-management of the government.

However, there are currently no conditions to achieve this goal in one step. The external market is not developed, and the internal running mechanism is not established. Chen Minheng said: "Under these circumstances, some powers, even if delegated down, the presidents dare not accept them."

The commodity economy is changing the relationship inside and outside the university walls. The "product" of the university is mainly talent, and talent will gradually enter society through the market. Whether the talent is suitable depends on whether it meets the needs of society; and in the increasingly developed conditions of commodity economy, the selection and verification of the market will, in turn, direct the setting of majors and the cultivation of talents. From this perspective, the phenomenon of graduates being returned for reallocation in the autumn of 1987 is not entirely a bad thing.

However, real life is much more complicated. In early 1988, the State Education Commission planned to introduce a reform plan: starting from 1989, universities would enroll students without guaranteed allocation. The news, once revealed by the media, caused a stir in the educational circles and society, with many people believing that the conditions were not ripe, and students were particularly concerned about the lack of equal opportunities in competition, holding a skeptical attitude towards the reform.

Indeed, we currently do not have a sound talent market, or we are facing a distorted market, and the information it reflects cannot reflect the actual needs of society. For example, many employers reject university graduates, not because they do not need these professional talents, but because those who cannot perform the job occupy the positions and there is no elimination mechanism. President Zhang Shixun of Guangzhou University said that only when the large social environment implements the reform of the labor and personnel system and truly forms a talent labor market, can the reform of universities be smoothly completed.

However, the current problem is that we cannot wait until the large environment is rectified before we start the reform in a leisurely manner. The reforms inside and outside the walls can only be carried out simultaneously or crosswise, and they can only complement each other. This determines that the reform of universities will encounter a series of special difficulties.

Chen Minheng keenly noticed that the impact of the commodity economy will first be reflected in student employment, and students will bear the pressure from society the earliest. However, in general, schools and teachers do not directly bear this pressure. Their work, good or bad, does not have a direct relationship with society, with funds allocated annually, old lecture notes distributed, and regardless of the storms, they stably enjoy the "iron rice bowl." The fiscal deficit is a fiscal deficit, and the state will not formulate a university bankruptcy law. This is also an important reason for the slow progress of university reforms.

Chen Minheng firmly believed in this point and boldly promoted the reform of the internal management system in East China University of Chemical Technology. His basic idea is to pass the pressure of students to the teachers and all staff of the school. The school implemented a system where teachers hang their names on the blackboard for classes, and students can choose teachers and courses; the number of students attending classes and the quality of teaching are used to evaluate the work performance of teachers, which is linked to their remuneration, titles, etc. During the summer vacation of 1987, the school demoted all section-level and below cadres on the spot and reappointed them for a term of 2 years, with the assessment completely based on their teaching service performance.

Introducing the mechanism of equal competition is a basic characteristic of the new educational system under the commodity economy. Schools produce talents, and talents compete in the talent market. Behind the competition of talents is the competition of schools in the educational market. President Ding Shisun of Peking University predicted: The out-of-control development of universities has many that are not what they seem, occupying the limited educational funds but unable to cultivate the corresponding number of qualified talents. Once equal competition is launched, the merger or elimination of schools will be inevitable.

The proportion of educational investment in China is too low, below the average of developing countries, which is an undeniable fact. The Central Committee and the State Council have decided to gradually increase the proportion of educational funds year by year. However, there is another equally serious problem, that is, the low efficiency of educational investment, which is probably also below the average of developing countries.

Statistics show that during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, China's educational expenditure increased by 72% compared to the "Sixth Five-Year Plan," but 77.7% of it was personnel expenses, and the funds used to improve teaching were less than 1/3.

The school organization is bloated, and there are too many redundant personnel. In 1986, the World Bank surveyed 136 universities in China and found that the average student-teacher ratio was 1:3.7 (according to the survey by China's educational administrative department, the student-teacher ratio of ordinary universities, including graduate students, correspondence students, and night school students, reached 1:7 in 1988). While in other countries in East Asia and the Pacific region, this ratio is 1:12, and China's ratio in 1949 also reached 1:7.3. The surveyors said: "Undoubtedly, China's professors should have their salaries increased, but they should also teach more students."

The fundamental way to reduce the bloat is to break the "iron rice bowl" and reform the labor and personnel system, but this is not something that a single school or institute can implement alone. Under the current environment, the effective promotion of reform can be seen in the "long-term division of labor" system of teachers at East China University of Chemical Technology. The school, based on the strengths and weaknesses of each teacher, divides and uses them: those who are good at teaching are allowed to focus on teaching; those who are good at technology development and management are brought out to show their skills; and the income from development and management benefits the state, the school, and all teachers. The result of "long-term division of labor" is to open up a new field of service to society, partially solving the problem of insufficient funds, while avoiding the disaster of "chasing money" impacting teaching.

The nature of the commodity economy is to activate everything, and only with living water is there vitality. The shortage of educational funds, of course, the state has the responsibility to gradually increase it, but schools relying on the state and waiting for the government to feed them is also not desirable. Under the conditions of the commodity economy, the sources of educational funds should be diversified, including state investment, social investment, and the increase of school assets. Several years ago, Deng Xuchu, the former Party Secretary of Shanghai Jiaotong University, who led the reform exploration of the university, proposed the idea of establishing school assets. Now, in Shenzhen University and some other universities, they have begun to establish their own industries, especially some new science and technology parks, giving people new hope.

However, we are still unfamiliar with the commodity economy, and currently, some people in society have a vulgar and one-sided understanding of the commodity economy, thinking that engaging in the commodity economy is simply about making money. In fact, we are building a socialist planned commodity economy, which is a completely new economic operating mechanism and social order. Some educators expressed their worries to the reporter, saying that when education enters the sea of commodity economy to swim, we must prevent going astray. We call for the market, but we must also see that the market is not omnipotent. Especially the thermometer of the market reflecting the demand for talents often reflects the short-term needs of the economy, while the educational cycle is relatively long. For the long-term talent needs of the country, there must still be planned guidance, such as the cultivation of basic research and high-tech talents, applied talents related to the national economy and people's livelihood, and the cultivation of teachers, etc.

Getting out of a stagnant pool and learning to swim in the sea of commodity economy, while not losing direction, the "crisis" can be turned into "vitality."

**Talents: The Urgent Call of the Century**

A sense of crisis is spreading in the educational circles of various developed countries in the world. This sense of crisis is mainly not from the relationship between education and politics, but from the challenges of the economy and technology. To meet this challenge, over the past twenty years, the higher education of the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France has successively begun major reforms.

As humanity approaches the 21st century, peace and development have become the main themes of international life. What will determine the future glory and decline of a country, the rise and fall of a nation, will no longer be mainly military confrontation, but the competition of comprehensive national power. The so-called comprehensive national power includes economic, technological, military, and other strengths, and the foundation that supports this comprehensive national power is mainly education.

When Bush took office as the President of the United States, he declared: He would strive to fulfill his promise made during the election to be an "education president." Bush said: "Education is the key to enhancing national competitiveness and the key to strengthening national spirit."

In fact, as early as the 1950s, American scholar Schultz, who won the Nobel Prize, proposed the new theory of education economics. Since then, Western developed countries have experienced a period of unprecedented growth in educational funds for over 20 years, and thus reaped economic growth. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization pointed out in a research report: People with different levels of education have different abilities to improve labor productivity: primary school 43%, middle school 108%, university 300%. Some Western scholars, using the input-output method, calculated that the role of intelligence factors (technological progress) in economic growth, at the beginning of the century, was only 5% to 20%, and now it has reached 60% to 80%.

Obviously, education can no longer be regarded as a social welfare undertaking but should be regarded as a highly profitable investment in productivity, an investment in the future.

In the 1960s and 1970s, when Western developed countries were adapting to the arrival of the new technological revolution, and when the "Four Little Dragons" of Asia were preparing for industrial transfer and investing heavily in education, we were in the predicament of the product economy and the turmoil of class struggle, missing the "golden period" of educational investment, and are still suffering the consequences today.

Now, as we welcome the new era of the 21st century, many countries have once again shifted their strategic focus to education. What about the situation in China?

The Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "We should put the development of science and technology and education in a leading position, and make economic construction rely on technological progress and the improvement of the quality of laborers." Our development strategy is very clear, and the Party and the state's determination to develop education is very great.

However, it is worrying that when we need to tighten our belts to run education, a trend of extravagance has emerged in society; we can spend tens of billions of dollars to import cars, but we have no money to run education; some places compete to build grand buildings, but do not repair dilapidated school buildings...

More worrying is the sudden spread of the "disdain for learning" trend. Although the proportion of students who disdain learning is not large, this "wind" disturbs people's minds. The reporter, from north to south, interviewed many university students and asked them why they felt that "studying is useless," and the answers were almost unanimous: "No matter how good you study, it's not as good as being an individual entrepreneur!"

Some people say this is brought about by the commodity economy.

Indeed, we have had a tradition of valuing education and learning since ancient times, but it is not that the Chinese people are born to love reading, but the interest orientation of "all professions are inferior, only reading is superior," and reading is the ladder to enter officialdom in the feudal era that formed it. After the founding of the country, the product economy opened the "iron rice bowl," but university graduates still had better material treatment and social status than other social groups. Therefore, although there was the "uselessness of studying" during the Cultural Revolution, after the disaster, once the college entrance examination was restored, the "theory of the uselessness of studying" immediately dissipated.

The "new theory of the uselessness of studying" that has emerged today is different from the "theory of the uselessness of studying" during the Cultural Revolution. It occurs in the confusion of the transition between the old and new systems. The emergence of the "new theory of the uselessness of studying" is obviously related to the unfair distribution in society, such as "those who make missiles are not as good as those who sell tea eggs." Some people blame this on the reform, blame it on the commodity economy. In fact, this is precisely the result of the underdevelopment of the commodity economy. Because our market is not developed, or we can say we only have half a market, those who sell tea eggs, individual entrepreneurs, private enterprises, and township enterprises can obtain benefits through market exchange of their labor, while those who make missiles and teach still rely on the wage income of the state. The former uses the method of the commodity economy to settle accounts, while the latter still uses the method of the product economy to distribute, the conflict of the coexistence of the two systems makes the price of talents and knowledge far lower than their value. This is the crux of the problem.

Undoubtedly, to break through this confused fog, it is not to retreat but to advance, to accelerate the development of the market and speed up the reform. In the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, where the commodity economy has taken the lead in development, people have seen such hope.

Last December, the reporter came to Shenzhen University and did not see the commercial atmosphere in some university campuses in the mainland. The atmosphere of studying was very strong. The library closes only at midnight every day; the classrooms are brightly lit at night. Students coming from outside to attend night school, their bicycles are lined up in rows, forming a magnificent sight. The number of applicants for the first choice of undergraduate programs has been increasing year by year, with an average of 16 applicants for one admission last year.

In this university, which does not guarantee allocation, the reporter asked a student: "What is your motivation for studying?" The answer was: "To improve competitiveness." In Shenzhen, the situation of two people, one with a university degree and one without, in career competition is completely different; similarly, two people with university degrees, those who study well and those who do not, have different situations in competition. The full development of the talent market and the full development of the commodity economy, once the correct interest orientation is formed, will be beneficial to the return of the tradition of valuing education and learning.

The existence of the commodity economy will inevitably change the students' concepts. However, in some universities in the mainland, this change in concepts still needs a process. Chen Minheng made a careful analysis of the students of East China University of Chemical Technology. He found that many university students seem to have new ideas, but many of them still have the old concepts caused by the product economy in their minds. They wait for the government to arrange everything for them, are used to benefiting without taking risks, and they still do not fully understand the socialist commodity economy. They do not understand that if the school does not run well, the teachers do not teach well, and they do not study well, they may not be able to sell themselves. Now, university students entering society are not mainly because of their poor business skills, but because of their poor psychological quality, poor ability to withstand pressure, and inability to adapt to the needs of social changes.

Of course, this cannot be blamed on the students, but on the problems of our higher education itself. Professor Gao Qi of Beijing Normal University proposed that under the conditions of the commodity economy, universities should cultivate free laborers. On the one hand, they should teach students how to make a living, how to choose a career, and cultivate their risk awareness; on the other hand, they should teach them basic knowledge, how to be a person, and methods of self-cultivation, so that students' personalities can be fully developed, and after entering society, they can adapt to the environment and choose the career that can best display their talents, rather than relying solely on the state.

In recent times, there has been a debate in the domestic educational circles about the function of education. One view emphasizes that education should serve economic construction, while another view emphasizes that education is about cultivating people and improving people's quality. Of course, there is also a third view, which is to combine the two, starting from improving people's quality to achieve the goal of serving society. The function of education should be multifaceted. The reform of higher education should not only adapt to the development of the commodity economy but also adapt to the construction of democratic politics and spiritual civilization. Our schools are not only places to impart knowledge but also places to teach how to be a person.

In the initial stage of the development of the commodity economy, it is inevitable to be accompanied by a certain degree of chaos. When people are dissatisfied with the decline of social morality, they almost all turn their hopeful eyes to our schools.

Higher education has always been a hall of national spiritual culture. Overcoming the "new theory of the uselessness of studying" and purifying the entire social atmosphere all require a call for a noble cultural spirit, a far-sighted vision for the nation and the future. People first place their hopes on higher education, hoping that a batch of new people with modern qualities will come out of there one after another.

Many enlightened people in the educational circles told the reporter that if our universities do not want to fall behind in the world, they must establish a new concept of talents from now on, that is, to cultivate students' independence, competition, innovation, and international awareness. This is the talent needed by the commodity economy and the construction of democratic politics, and this is the new-type builder needed in the 21st century.

Under the conditions of the product economy, universities cultivate uniform talents of the same type, emphasizing the commonality of education. Such talents have many advantages, but in the new situation of the development of the commodity economy, the construction of democratic politics, and the rapid development of high technology, there are many inapplicable aspects. In the face of the tide of the commodity economy, how higher education can cultivate new-type talents who have common ideals and pursuits, as well as distinct and lively personalities and innovative spirits, has become a prominent problem. Under the guidance of the national educational policy, each school should have its own characteristics, each major should have its own characteristics, and each student should be taught according to his abilities, fully developing his potential.

The waves of the new technological revolution are crashing against the university walls. Since the 1970s, in the tide of global educational reform, educational thought has undergone great changes, with the most significant being the shift from traditional knowledge education to innovative education. However, the teaching content of most universities in China is outdated, and the teaching methods are rigid, and the emergence of the "new theory of the uselessness of studying" is also related to "reading useless books." Experts from the Chinese Educational Science Research Institute called for: changing educational thought, cultivating talents for the 21st century, and this should be put on the agenda of educational reform.

"Facing modernization, facing the world, facing the future," an unprecedented sense of urgency is before us.

Educational backwardness is an important reason for national backwardness. Low national quality is the biggest obstacle to national rejuvenation. The hope for the revitalization of education lies in reform.

The builders of the 21st century have already entered our schools. Everyone who cares about the future and destiny of the motherland should care about education, care about educational reform!

    １９８７年秋，在《中共中央关于教育体制改革的决定》发布两年多之后，几起学潮的小麻烦平息之后，上海交通大学等充满乐观情调的先期改革尝试渐渐销声匿迹，几乎全国高校都出现了毕业分配退生现象，有５０００多人不得不进行第二、第三次分配。这虽然是个不大的数字，但在一个人才匮乏的国度，在“包分配”的体制下，这也可说是一叶惊秋，传递的是不同寻常的信息。
    一波未平，一波又起。１９８８年春，正当“两会”（七届全国人大、七届全国政协会议）代表在会上大声疾呼教育经费不足时，几乎全国高校都卷进了“社会有偿服务”的酸甜苦辣之中。大学校长们的日子的确不好过：按国家拨款，１９８８年清华大学亏空８００万元，北京大学亏空１０００万元，北京航天航空大学亏空７００万元，广州大学亏空６０万元……被财政赤字困扰的大学校长，不得不去抓“经济收入”。
    随着炎炎夏日的到来，经商热在大学校园兴起。中国人民大学的学生咖啡厅、北京师范大学的商业一层楼，名播京华；教师卖小吃、博士摆商摊、大学生当起校园个体户，已非新闻。
    一股厌学风在悄悄蔓延。
    中国人民大学哲学系一位老师告诉记者，她讲课时，学生从最后一排坐起，问原因，答曰：“溜起来方便。”有的班级学生轮流来听课，来的人指定一人记笔记，其余人搞“副业”，问为何还有一人记笔记，答曰：“应付考试。”
    有人对上海市３万名大学生作调查，认真学习的只有１／４。
    杭州大学去年开除几名学生，被开除者竟然为此设宴感谢老师。
    １９８７年研究生退学者７００多人，１９８８年达９００多人。去年秋，东北工学院的一个研究所计划招收１０名研究生，只录取到４人，而最后来报到的，只有一人。中国人民大学去年录取一名硕士生，没来报到，却到旅游局报到当导游去了。
    “新的读书无用论”突然抬头。
    比少数学生厌学更值得注意的，是少数教师厌教。据首都教育界人士估算，高校约有１／３的教师没有集中精力上课。青年教师的流失也正在成为问题。北京大学一位博士毕业生坚决不愿留校，到一个饭店当了经理。
    在首都高校流传着一句新的调侃语：“看你穷得像个教授，傻得像个博士。”
    来自高等教育界这些突如其来的消息，搅起一片“神州忧思”，也使许多人陷入迷惘。人们在问：中国的教育究竟出了什么事？
    有人认定：我们出现了“教育危机”。而也有人认为：我们的教育处于历史上最好时期。
    持后一种观点的人也摆出了自己的根据。党的十一届三中全会以来，我国教育事业大发展。从１９７７年至１９８８年，普通高校数从４０４所增至１０７５所；招生数从２７．３万人增至６６．９７万人；在校生突破２００万。这样的发展速度非但在中国教育史上为仅见，在世界上也是不多的。尤其值得注意的是，高等教育的发展是随着改革、开放的进程展开的，从招生、培养到分配的整个过程已经或正在进行一系列改革。
    两种观点，各执一端，究竟孰是孰非？
    记者就此拜访了一大批教育界的专家、教育主管部门的官员、教育科研机构的研究人员，并且从北到南考察和采访了一些著名大学。在考察过程中，一个新的视角逐渐清晰起来。
    华东化工学院院长陈敏恒教授认为：“目前高校改革中遇到的一切困惑，本质上都是从社会主义产品经济向社会主义商品经济转轨时两种机制的冲突，是一种前进中的困难。”
    中国历史上的确有重教育的传统，但封建时代的教育几乎只有一个目的，就是为封建王朝培养官吏。尤其是从隋唐到清末的科举制，把做官作为读书的唯一出路。由于教育与经济、科技相剥离，虽有两千年的重教传统，依然导致了近代的衰败。所以上世纪末中国传统教育向近代教育的转轨，是中华民族的一个历史性进步。
    然而中国近代教育的发端与欧美有很大不同。如英国的近代高等教育，是工业革命的直接产物，是经济发展与市场的内在动力呼唤出来的。而中国的近代教育，是洋务运动后像机器和炮舰一样从外部移植过来的。它为推进中国的近代化培养了大批人才，但由于始终缺少一个坚实的经济基础，又常处于民族危亡的风雨之中，所以在本世纪的前半个世纪，它不可能有一个健康的发展。
    １９４９年中华人民共和国的成立，揭开了中国教育史上辉煌的一页。随着工业化的迅速推进，教育事业获得了前所未有的发展。在十几年时间里，教育为国家的建设和管理输送了几百万专门人才，成为构筑共和国大厦的重要智力基石。新中国培养的这批知识分子，至今是我们民族大业的支柱之一，在他们身上体现了新中国教育事业不可抹杀的成绩。
    但是，由于整个国家的经济体制选择了产品经济模式，高等教育在经过院系调整后，被迅速纳入高度集中计划的轨道。这种教育体制的一个突出特点，是国家的大包大统，从建校、专业设置、投资拨款到学生的招收与分配，都靠国家的一本计划。“千校一面，万人一书”，把培养人才等同于生产机器零件。这种“产品”模式妨碍了人的个性发展，旧的教育体制影响了学校、教师和学生的活力，导致教学的僵化和教育生产力的萎缩。再加上从６０年代初开始的“大学要以阶级斗争为主课”，发展到“文革”的浩劫，几次折腾，弄得高等教育奄奄一息。旧的教育体制同产品经济一起，在历史面前碰了壁。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，中国社会发生了根本性的转折。随着农村经济改革的巨大成功，城市经济改革全面展开，逐步明确了改革的目标模式，是要抛弃产品经济旧体制，建立社会主义有计划的商品经济新体制。尤其是近几年来，城乡市场正在加速发育，商品生产搅动了整个社会。
    教育本来是较早“拨乱反正”的一个领域，重视教育的呼声从“文革”劫后的校园里传遍全社会。但当时的重教，基本上是重建“文革”前１７年的教育模式。沿着这一思路的“教育复兴”，同时也重复了产品经济下旧教育体制的弊病。
    有一个有趣的对比。１９５８年，是“文革”前１７年我国高等教育发展的高峰，有人称之为“教育爆炸”：这一年新办高校８６０多所，在校生比前一年增加２／３。由于大大超过了国力的承受力，后来不得不调整下马。这次“爆炸”固然与“大跃进”的错误指导思想有关，更内在的原因却在于办学的机制，只需上级领导点头，不受社会和市场的检验。而国家又只根据学校规格和招生数量拨款，这就刺激高校单纯追求规格与规模。
    没有想到，８０年代中期又出现了一次“爆炸”。仅１９８５年，全国新办（包括升格）高等学校１１４所，平均３至４天一所。本来国家的人才结构就不合理，中等专业技术人才奇缺，一些中专和大专却拚命抢着升格。因为升成大学后，校领导可随之升官，教师们晋升职称的比例增加，经费和学生出路反正有国家大包大揽，何乐而不为呢？１９８５年的高校发展失控，原因是多方面的，与１９５８年的头脑发热有完全不同的动因，但它们的病根都是产品经济的旧体制。
    教育体制改革由于内外环境的限制，迟迟未能跟上经济体制改革的步伐。这就产生了一个落差：商品经济的大潮突然冲到大学的院墙下，校园里的一切还来不及适应外界的变化。一切矛盾与困扰由此而起。
    如果说，这就是“教育危机”的话，那么这“危机”恰恰提供了改革的动力与机会，只要引导得法，“危机”就有可能变成“生机”。
    中国的高等教育将在商品经济的大潮中进行一次新的改造。这是中国几千年教育史上的第二次大转轨。它酝酿着中华民族的文明新变迁。从这个意义上讲我国教育事业处在历史上最好时期，千真万确！
    　　　　体制，在围墙内外撞击
    一个发人深思的问题：中国３０多年来建立了庞大的教育体系，可为什么难出教育家？
    一位大学校长告诉记者，校园门朝哪个方向开，厕所坑位多大尺寸，他管不了，要由教育行政部门根据基建计划审批。至于学校办什么系、设什么专业、开什么课、要多少老师、招多少学生……更有一本统一的计划管着。
    在旧体制下，大学只是教育行政部门的附庸，不是一个真正的社会实体。它没有自主权，无力决定自己的命运。
    高校的改革，如同经济体制改革一样，从放权开始。国家教委政研室负责同志告诉记者，现在教委除新办大学的审批权和制定大学专业目录外，权已经都放下去了，再没有可放的了。有些权，如计划、财政、人事权，并不掌握在教委手里，而是由计划、财政、人事部门掌握着，我们也无能为力。可是，大学校长们还是嚷嚷没有自主权，这是怎么回事？
    广东省高教局教学处负责人说，国家教委把部分高校的管理权下放给省或部委。省里怎么管？还不是像教委以前那样管。
    大学校长们则说，把管理权下放给省或部委，只是给我们增加了一个更不高明的婆婆。
    在产品经济体制下，大学的一切都由上级包揽着，睡在国家温暖的摇篮里，虽然没有自主权，不出教育家，倒也舒舒服服。问题是产品经济正在急速解体，市场把竞争与风险突然推到校长们面前，无论是教育经费还是毕业生分配，国家很难再大包大揽下去了。校长们呼唤自主权，几乎是在呼唤生存权。
    深圳大学校长罗征启说，大学要成为独立的办学实体，要有法人地位，才能在商品经济的社会环境中生存发展。
    华东化工学院院长陈敏恒认为，高校的改革目标，是建立一套与商品经济相适应的运行机制，可以设想让社会和市场成为高校的真正“上级”。当然，在现代社会，高校不可能完全脱离政府的宏观管理。
    不过，目前还没有条件一步走到这个目标。外部的市场不发育，内部的运行机制未建立。陈敏恒说：“在这种情况下，有些权力放下来校长也不敢要。”
    商品经济正在改变着大学院墙内外的关系。大学的“产品”主要是人才，而人才要逐步通过市场走向社会。人才是否适用，取决于是否符合社会的需要；而在商品经济日益发展的条件下，市场的挑选与检验，将反过来指挥专业设置与人才培养。从这个角度看，１９８７年秋高校毕业分配的退生现象，并不完全是坏事。
    然而，实际生活要复杂得多。１９８８年初，国家教委打算出台一项改革方案：从１９８９年起，高校将招收不包分配的学生。消息一经新闻媒介披露，教育界内外舆论哗然，不少人认为条件不成熟，学生尤其担心竞争缺乏平等的机会，对改革持怀疑态度。
    确实，目前我们还没有一个健全的人才市场，或者说面临的是一个扭曲的市场，它反馈的信息不能反映社会的实际需求。比如许多用人单位拒收大学生，并非不需要这些专业人才，而是因为不能胜任工作的人占据了岗位而又没有淘汰机制。广州大学校长张士勋说，只有社会大环境实行劳动人事制度的改革，真正形成人才劳务市场，高校的改革才能顺利完成。
    然而现在的问题是我们不可能等大环境治理好了才从容起步改革，院墙内外的改革只能同步或交叉进行，只能是相辅相成。这就决定了高校改革会遇到一系列特殊困难。
    陈敏恒敏锐地察觉到，商品经济的冲击会首先在学生就业上反映出来，学生最早承受着来自社会的压力。而在一般情况下，学校和老师不直接承受这种压力。他们的工作好坏，与社会不发生直接关系，每年经费照拨，旧讲义照发，任凭风浪起，稳吃“大锅饭”。财政赤字归财政赤字，国家总不会制定一个大学破产法。这也是高校改革进展迟缓的一个重要原因。
    陈敏恒认准了这一点，在华东化工学院大胆推行内部管理体制的改革。他的基本思路是把学生的压力传递给教师和学校的全体职工。学校实行了教师挂牌上课制度，学生可以选择老师，选择课程；以学生听课人数多寡与教学质量高低来衡量教师的工作实绩，并与待遇、职称等挂钩。１９８７年暑假，学校对全院处级及其以下干部一律就地免职重新聘任，任期２年，完全以对教学服务的实绩进行考核。
    引入平等竞争的机制，是商品经济下新教育体制的基本特征。学校生产的是人才，人才要到人才市场上去竞争。人才竞争的背后，是学校在教育市场上的竞争。北京大学校长丁石孙预言：高校发展失控，有不少名不副实，它们挤占了有限的教育经费，却培养不出相应数量的合格人才，平等竞争一旦展开，学校的淘汰或合并将不可避免。
    我国教育投资比例过低，在发展中国家的平均值以下，乃不争之事实。党中央和国务院已决心逐年增加教育经费的比例。但还有一个问题同样严重，即教育投资效益过低，恐怕也在发展中国家的平均值以下。
    统计表明，“七五”期间我国教育事业费比“六五”增加７２％，但其中７７．７％是人头费，用于改善教学的经费不足１／３。
    学校机构臃肿，冗员充斥。１９８６年，世界银行对我国１３６所大学调查，发现平均师生比为１∶３．７（据我国教育主管部门调查，普通高校师生比如将研究生、函授生、夜大生计算在内，１９８８年达１∶７）。而在东亚和太平洋地区的其它国家，这一比例是１∶１２，我国１９４９年的比例也曾达到过１∶７．３。调查者说：“毫无疑问，应给中国的教授提高工资，但他们教的学生也应该更多。”
    消肿的根本出路在于敲碎“铁饭碗”，改革劳动人事制度，但这决不是一校一院可以单独实行的。在现有环境下有效推进改革，当数华东化工学院的教师“扬长分流”制度。学校依据每个教师的长处和短处，分而用之：擅长讲课的，让他一门心思教学；擅长技术开发和经营的，拉出来让他大显身手；而开发经营的收益，国家、学校和全体教师都得好处。“扬长分流”的结果，是开辟了为社会服务的新领域，部分解决了经费不足的困难，而又避免了单纯“抓钱”冲击教学之祸。
    商品经济的性格是把一切都搞活，活水才有生机。教育经费不足，国家当然有责任逐年增加，但学校躺在国家身上，等着政府来喂养也是不足取的。在商品经济条件下，教育经费的来源应当多元化，包括国家投资、社会投资和校产增殖。曾经领导上海交通大学改革探索的该校前党委书记邓旭初几年前就提出了建立校产的主张。如今在深圳大学和其它一些高校，已经开始创办自己的产业，尤其是一些新兴的科学工业园，使人们看到了新的希望。
    但是我们对商品经济毕竟是陌生的，目前社会上就有些人对商品经济产生庸俗、片面的理解，以为搞商品经济就是单纯捞钱。其实我们要建设的社会主义有计划商品经济是一种全新的经济运行机制和社会秩序。说高校改革要适应商品经济正是指要适应新的机制和秩序。一些教育界人士不无忧虑地对记者说，当教育来到商品经济的大海游泳的时候，要防止误入歧途。我们呼唤市场，但也要看到，市场不是万能的。尤其是市场的温度计所反映的人才需求，往往是经济上的近期需要，而教育周期比较长，对于国家远期的人才需求，还是要有计划指导，例如基础研究和高技术人才的培养、有关国计民生的应用人才培养和师资的培养等。
    走出一潭死水，到商品经济的大海里学会游泳，而又不迷失方向，“危机”才能变成“生机”。
    　　　　人才，跨世纪的急切召唤
    一种危机感在世界各发达国家的教育界蔓延。这种危机感，主要不是来自教育与政治的关系，而是来自经济科技方面的挑战。为迎接这种挑战，近一二十年来，美国、日本、苏联、英国、法国的高等教育，相继开始了重大改革。
    在人类走向２１世纪的时候，和平与发展成为国际生活的主旋律。决定未来国家荣辱、民族兴衰的，将不再主要是军事对抗，而是综合国力的竞争。所谓综合国力，包括经济、科技、军事等实力，而托起这综合国力的基石，主要是教育。
    布什在登上美国总统宝座时宣称：他将努力兑现他在竞选时所作的要当一位“教育总统”的许诺。布什说：“教育是提高民族竞争力的关键，是增强国民精神的关键。”
    其实，早在５０年代，获得诺贝尔奖金的美国学者舒尔茨就提出教育经济学的新理论。此后，西方发达国家有过长达２０年的教育经费的空前增长，并由此收获了经济的增长。联合国教科文组织在一份研究报告中指出：不同文化水平的人，其提高劳动生产率的能力不同：小学４３％，中学１０８％，大学３００％。西方有些学者应用投入产出法计算得出：智力因素（科技进步）在经济增长中的作用，在本世纪初只有５％到２０％，而现在已达６０％到８０％。
    显然，教育已不能再被看作社会福利事业，而应被认作是一本万利的生产力投资，是对未来的投资。
    ６０年代和７０年代，正当西方发达国家为适应新技术革命的到来，正当“亚洲四小龙”为准备产业转移而对教育大量投资时，我们正好处在产品经济的困境和阶级斗争的动乱中，错过了教育投资的“黄金时期”，至今在饱尝着它的苦果。
    如今在迎接２１世纪的新纪元时，许多国家又把战略重点放到教育上。那么，中国的情况又是怎样呢？
    党的十三大指出：要“把发展科学技术和教育事业放在首要位置，使经济建设转到依靠科技进步和提高劳动者素质的轨道上来”。我们的发展战略是很明确的，党和国家发展教育的决心是很大的。
    但值得忧虑的是，正当我们需要勒紧裤带办教育的时候，社会上出现了一股奢侈风；可以花几十亿美元进口小轿车，却无钱办教育；有的地方竞相盖楼堂馆所，却不去修校舍危房……
    更值得忧虑的，就是突然弥漫的“厌学风”，厌学的学生比例虽不大，但此“风”扰乱人心。记者从北到南采访了许多大学生，问他们为什么觉得“读书无用”，得到的回答几乎异口同声：“学得再好也不如一个个体户！”
    有人说，这是搞商品经济带来的。
    确实，我们自古以来就有重教好学的传统，但并非中国人天生爱读书，而是封建时代“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”、读书是进入仕途的阶梯这一利益导向促成的。建国后，产品经济虽然开了“大锅饭”，但大学毕业生在物质待遇和社会地位方面还是略优于其他社会群体的。所以虽有“文革”中的倒行逆施，浩劫一过，一旦恢复高考，“读书无用论”立即烟消云散。
    眼下出现的“新的读书无用论”与“文革”中的“读书无用论”不同，它是在新旧体制转轨这一非常时期发生的混乱。
    “新的读书无用论”的出现显然与“搞导弹的不如卖茶叶蛋的”之类社会分配不公有关，有人把它归罪于改革，归罪于商品经济。其实，这恰恰是商品经济不发达造成的。由于我们的市场不发育，也可以说只有半个市场，卖茶叶蛋的、个体户、私营企业和乡镇企业可以通过市场交换自己的劳动而获得收益，搞导弹的、教书的却仍靠国家的工薪收入。前者是用商品经济的方法结算，后者仍用产品经济的方法分配，两种体制并存的冲突，使得人才与知识的价格远远低于其价值。这就是问题的症结。
    毫无疑问，要冲出这一混乱的雾区，不是后退，而是前进，是加速发育市场，加快改革。在商品经济的发展先走一步的深圳特区，人们看到了这样的希望。
    去年１２月，记者来到深圳大学，反而不见内地一些大学校园的商业气息，读书的气氛很浓。图书馆每天午夜才关门；教室里入夜灯火通明。从校外来读夜大学的学生，自行车列成方阵，蔚为壮观。本科生报名人数逐年增加，去年报第一志愿者平均１６人录取１人。
    在这所不包分配的大学里，记者问一位同学：“你们读书的动力是什么？”回答是：“为了提高竞争力。”在深圳，有大学学历与没有大学学历的两个人，在职业竞争中的状况完全不一样；同样有大学学历的两个人，学得好的与学得不好的在竞争中的态势也不同。人才市场的充分发育，商品经济的充分发展，一旦形成正确的利益导向，必将有利于唤回重教好学的传统。
    商品经济的社会存在必将改变学生的观念。而目前在内地一些大学，这种观念变革还需要一个过程。陈敏恒对华东化工学院的学生作了仔细的分析。他发现，许多大学生好像思想很新，其实不少人头脑里仍有产品经济造成的旧观念。他们等待政府给他们安排好一切，习惯于不冒风险而能受益，他们还不能完全理解社会主义的商品经济。他们不明白，学校办不好，教师教不好，自己学不好，他们就可能销不出去。现在的大学生走上社会，主要不是业务能力差，而是心理素质不行，承受能力差，适应不了社会变革的需要。
    这当然不能怪学生，而是我们高等教育本身的问题。北京师范大学高奇教授提出，在商品经济条件下，大学要培养自由的劳动者。一方面，要教给学生谋生手段、择业能力和培养其风险意识；另一方面，要教给他们基本知识、做人的道理和自我修养的方法，使学生的个性得到充分发展，走上社会后能适应环境，选择最能发挥自己才能的职业，而不是一味地依靠国家。
    最近一个时期，国内教育界发生了关于教育功能问题的争论，一种意见强调教育为经济建设服务，另一种意见强调教育就是育人，就是提高人的素质。当然，也还有第三种意见，那就是把两者结合起来，从提高人的素质着手来达到为社会服务的目的。教育的功能应当是多方面的。高教改革不光要适应商品经济的发展，还要适应民主政治和精神文明的建设。我们的学校，不光是传授知识的场所，更是教会怎样做人的地方。
    在商品经济发展的初始阶段，不可避免地伴随着一定程度的混乱。当人们不满于社会道德水准跌落的时候，几乎都把希望的目光投向我们的学校。
    高等学校从来是一个民族精神文化的殿堂。克服“新的读书无用论”，净化整个社会的空气，都需要呼唤一种高尚的文化精神，一种为民族为未来的高瞻远瞩的目光。人们首先寄希望于高等学校，希望从那里走出一届又一届具有现代品格的新人。
    教育界的许多有识之士告诉记者，我们的大学要想不在世界上落后，一定要从现在起就树立新的人才意识，即培养学生自立、竞争、创新和国际意识。这正是商品经济和民主政治建设所需要的人才，正是２１世纪所需要的新型建设者。
    在产品经济条件下，高校培养的是整齐划一的同类型人才，教育强调共性。这样的人才有许多优点，但在商品经济发展、民主政治建设和高技术突飞猛进的新形势下，有许多不适应之处。在商品经济的大潮面前，高等教育如何培养出既有共同的理想和追求、又有鲜明活泼的个性和创新精神的新型人才，成为一个突出的问题。在国家的教育方针指导下，每个学校要有自己的个性，每个专业要有自己的个性，每个学生都应因材施教，充分发展他的潜能。
    新技术革命的浪潮拍击大学院墙。７０年代以来，在世界教育改革的潮流中，教育思想发生了很大变化，其中最主要的是传统的知识教育让位于创新教育。而我国目前大多数高校教学内容陈旧、教学方法呆板，“新的读书无用论”出现显然也与“读无用书”有关。中国教育科学研究所的专家们呼吁：改变教育思想，培养２１世纪的人才，应当提上教育改革的议事日程。
    “面向现代化，面向世界，面向未来”，一种前所未有的紧迫感摆在我们面前。
    教育落后是国家落后的重要原因。民族素质低下是民族振兴的最大障碍。振兴教育的希望在于改革。
    ２１世纪的建设者现在已进入我们的学校了。一切关心祖国前途和命运的人们，都来关心教育，关心教育改革！
