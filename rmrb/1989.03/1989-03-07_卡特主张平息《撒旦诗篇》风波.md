Carter Advocates Calming the "Satanic Verses" Controversy

NEW YORK, March 5 (Xinhua) — Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has called for negotiations to ease the "Satanic Verses" controversy and resolve the resulting diplomatic crisis between Western Europe and Iran.

This view was expressed in an article published in today's New York Times.

In the article, Carter pointed out that breaking off diplomatic relations with Iran would be an "excessive reaction." Only appropriate public statements and private discussions can ease the explosive situation caused by the book.

Carter believes that Iran's religious leader Khomeini's death sentence on the book's author Salman Rushdie is a "repugnant response." The West should protect the author's life and freedom of publication, but the West should also pay attention to the anger of millions of Muslims towards this book.

　　卡特主张平息《撒旦诗篇》风波
    本报纽约３月５日电  记者刘开宸报道：美国前总统卡特主张通过协商平息《撒旦诗篇》风波，妥善解决因此引起的西欧与伊朗的外交危机。
    此看法是卡特在今天的《纽约时报》上发表的一篇文章中提出来的。
    他在文章中指出，如与伊朗断交将是一个“过度反应”，只有得体的公开声明和私下讨论才能缓和因此书而引起的爆炸性的形势。
    卡特认为，伊朗宗教领袖霍梅尼对该书作者拉什迪的死刑判决确是一个“令人憎恶的反应”，西方应保护作家的生命安全和出版自由；但是，西方也应注意千百万穆斯林对此书的愤怒之情。
