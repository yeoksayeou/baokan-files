Title: The Joy and Worry of Leadership Attention to Education

Educators from the grassroots level almost unanimously emphasize that for any region to vigorously develop education, the first step is to have leadership attention, especially from the top leaders. This is indeed the case. For instance, when the provincial leaders of Shandong paid attention to education, Shandong's education made significant progress in recent years. Similarly, when the county leaders of Wutai County in Shanxi paid attention to education, the long-standing issue of insufficient education funds in the county was effectively resolved. Recently, it was heard that the State Education Commission will reward a batch of such leaders, which is appropriate. These far-sighted leaders indeed treat the development of education as a major issue related to the prosperity of the country and the nation. For their efforts in promoting the development of education, the people and our future generations will not forget them.

Developing education indeed requires leadership attention. However, what if Zhang, the provincial governor, pays attention to education during his term, but Li, the next provincial governor, does not? In reality, such situations are not uncommon in our country. Naturally, every leader inevitably has their own preferences. However, if our education cause is merely dependent on the wisdom of a particular leader, then the so-called "education is the foundation of a hundred-year plan" and the so-called "must insist on placing the development of education in a prominent strategic position" would be difficult to achieve. If the development of the education cause is merely dependent on the wisdom of a particular leader, this is indeed a tragedy for the education cause.

From this perspective, to insist on "education as the foundation," the primary condition is not to seek leadership attention, but to seek a mechanism, a new education development operation mechanism based on the socialist commodity economy. It should not change with the change of leaders, but be determined by national legislation. Under the current education operation mechanism, schools are merely appendages of administrative organs. The driving force and performance evaluation of schools do not come from the needs of economic and social development, but from the planned indicators of higher-level leadership departments. Higher-level attention means education development; higher-level neglect means education stagnation. Education is detached from society, and education itself lacks dynamism and vitality.

Therefore, the urgent task is to reform the current education system, adapt to the development of the socialist commodity economy, and establish a new education development operation mechanism. Moreover, it is necessary to determine the status and tasks, rights and obligations, interests and responsibilities of education through legislative procedures to ensure the development of the education cause. In Pingdu County, Shandong Province, a county-wide unified People's Education Fund was established. After being discussed and approved by the County People's Congress, it became a local regulatory institution, thus ensuring that regardless of who becomes the county magistrate, the People's Education Fund system will be implemented. If from the central to the local levels, all aspects of the education cause are established in the form of national laws or local regulations, then whether it is Zhang, the provincial governor, Li, the director, Wang, the mayor, or Ma, the county magistrate, they will all perform their duties according to the needs of social and economic development and the provisions of national laws, truly placing the education cause in a prominent strategic position, without the need for people to call for their attention.

Only in this way can education truly embark on the path of development.

　　领导重视的喜和忧
    马尚
    来自基层的教育工作者，在谈到发展教育事业的时候，几乎都无一例外地强调，任何地方要想大力发展教育，首先一条是要领导重视，而且要一把手重视，那个地方的教育才能有生机。事实也确是如此。君不见山东省省长、书记重视教育，山东的教育近几年便取得长足发展；山西省五台县县长、书记重视教育，该县教育经费长期短缺问题便得以妥善解决。近闻国家教委将奖励一批这样的领导，这是应该的。这些富有远见的领导者们，确实把发展教育当做关系国家富强、民族兴盛的大事来抓，对于他们为发展教育事业所作出的种种努力，人民和我们的子孙都不会忘记的。
    发展教育当然需要领导重视，不过，假如张省长执政时重视教育，而李省长执政时又不那么重视教育，该怎么办？实际上，这样的事情在我们的国家并不鲜见。自然，每位领导者都不可避免地会有自己的好恶。但是，如果我们的教育事业只是随着好者兴、恶着衰，那么，所谓的“百年大计，教育为本”、所谓的“必须坚持把发展教育事业放在突出的战略位置”，又从何说起呢？教育事业的发展只是寄托在某位领导者的明智之上，这委实是教育事业的悲哀。
    如此看来，要坚持“教育为本”，首要的条件并不是寻求领导重视，而应该寻求一种机制，一种建立在社会主义商品经济基础之上的新的教育发展运行机制。它不随领导者的更迭而变化，而由国家立法加以确定。在现行的教育运行机制下，学校不过是行政机关的附庸，学校办学的动力和效益检验，并不是来自经济和社会发展的需求，而是上级领导部门的计划指标。上级重视，教育就发展；上级忽视，教育就停滞。教育与社会脱节，教育本身亦缺乏动力与活力。
    因此，当务之急是改革现行教育体制，适应社会主义商品经济的发展，建立起新的教育发展运行机制，而且应该通过立法程序，确定教育的地位和任务、权利和义务、利益和责任等等，确保教育事业的发展。在山东省平度县，建立了全县统筹的人民教育基金，经县人民代表大会讨论通过后，使其成为具有地方法规性的制度，这就保证了不管谁当县长，人民教育基金制度都将执行。如果从中央到地方都把教育事业的方方面面，以国家立法或地方性法规的形式确立下来，那么，无论张省长、李主任，还是王市长、马县长，都将按照社会和经济发展的需求，依据国家法律的规定，去履行他们的职责，真正把教育事业放在突出的战略位置，而无须人们去呼唤他们重视。
    唯其如此，教育才能真正走上发展之途。
