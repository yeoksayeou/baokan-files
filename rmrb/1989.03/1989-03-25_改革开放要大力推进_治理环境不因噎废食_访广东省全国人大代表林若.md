Guangdong Province is a star in China's reform and opening-up economy. However, in recent years, people have had many criticisms about its social environment. Does economic development necessarily come with bad social practices? With this question in mind, the reporter interviewed People's Representative and Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Lin Ruo.

Lin Ruo said that since the implementation of the open policy, Guangdong's social problems have indeed increased compared to the past, but they are not as bad as some people say, with everything being wrong.

Lin Ruo believes that the socialist commodity economy has replaced the product economy, leading to a significant increase in the population's mobility. With so many people moving around quickly, how can there not be some problems? From a provincial perspective, social problems are mainly concentrated in a few large cities like Guangzhou. The vast majority of medium and small cities and rural areas have stable social order, with fewer complaints, grievances, and dissatisfied sentiments.

"This is also a characteristic of Guangdong," Lin Ruo said with a smile. "We must pay attention to various problems that arise in society, but we cannot abandon everything because of minor issues. As long as we persist in promoting economic construction on one hand and ideological and political work on the other, society will continue to prosper, and problems will be reduced to the minimum."

　　改革开放要大力推进        
    治理环境不因噎废食       
    ——访广东省全国人大代表林若
    本报记者  袁建达
    广东省是中国改革、开放的经济“明星”，但是，近年来人们对它的社会环境似乎颇多微词。经济发展是否就必然与不良风气结伴而行？带着这个问题，记者采访了人大代表、中共广东省委书记林若。
    林若说，自从实行开放政策以来，广东的社会问题确实比从前多了些，但绝不像某些人说的那样丑恶丛生，什么都不行。
    林若认为，社会主义商品经济取代了产品经济，使得社会上流动人口大大增加。那么多人迅速流动，怎么会不发生一些问题呢？从全省来看，社会问题仅仅集中在广州等少数几个大城市，广大的中小城市和农村社会秩序十分稳定，牢骚、怨言、不满情绪市场较少。
    “这也算是广东的特色吧。”林若笑着说：“我们要重视社会上出现的各种问题，但不能因噎废食。只要坚持一手抓经济建设，一手抓思想政治工作，社会就会持续繁荣，问题就能减少到最低限度。”
