Shanghai's well-known Mayfair toothpaste series improved its hygiene standards last year by referencing U.S. federal quality standards. As a result, its market value doubled, and its export earnings increased by 35% compared to the previous year. Shanghai-produced basketballs, volleyballs, and soccer balls, which adopted international standards, have had 8 varieties approved for international competition use, with annual exports exceeding 1 million units.

These are two examples of Shanghai's industrial products adopting international standards to improve economic benefits. Currently, Shanghai has 2,200 industrial items that have adopted international or advanced foreign standards. Additionally, several hundred textile, light industrial, and chemical products have adopted trade quality agreement standards according to international customs.

International standards are quality standards formulated by international authoritative academic organizations or testing institutions, representing the advanced level of contemporary times. Adopting international standards allows enterprises to gain a quality advantage in participating in international market competition. Shanghai's shipbuilding industry's adherence to the quality regulations of the international Lloyd's Register has significantly improved the reputation of its exported ships and shipbuilding steel in the international market.

In recent years, the Shanghai municipal government has been actively promoting the adoption of international standards by enterprises. They have organized special training classes to lecture on international standards and train personnel. They have also included the implementation of international standards as an important part of strengthening enterprise management and promoting technological progress, incorporating it into the contracts signed with various enterprises.

### 上海企业向国际标准看齐  两千多项出口工业品身价倍增

　　上海企业向国际标准看齐        
    两千多项出口工业品身价倍增
    据新华社上海３月２５日电  （记者吴复民）遐迩闻名的上海美加净系列牙膏，去年参照美国联邦质量标准提高了卫生指标，结果身价倍增，出口创汇额比上年骤增３５％。上海生产的篮、排、足球采用国际标准后，有８个品种被批准为国际比赛用球，出口数量每年超过１００万只。
    这是上海工业产品采用国际标准提高经济效益两例。如今，这个市已有２２００项工业品采用国际标准或国外先进标准；还有数百种纺织、轻工和化工产品，按照国际惯例，采用了贸易质量协议标准。
    国际标准是由国际权威学术团体或检测机构制订的质量标准，代表着当代先进水平。采用国际标准，可使企业在参与国际市场竞争中占据质量优势。上海造船行业执行国际劳氏船级社的质量规范，出口船舶和船用钢板在国际市场声誉鹊起就是明证。
    上海市政府近年来着力推动企业采用国际标准。他们专门举办学习班宣讲国际标准，培训干部；还把执行国际标准作为加强企业管理、推进技术进步的重要内容，列入同各企业签订的承包合同。
