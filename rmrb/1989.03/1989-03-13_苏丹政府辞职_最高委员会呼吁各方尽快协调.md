The Sudanese government has resigned. The Supreme Council calls for swift coordination among all parties.

	BEIJING, March 12 (Xinhua) -- According to local radio broadcasts, the Sudanese Supreme Council today formally accepted the resignation of the current Sudanese government led by Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi. The Sudanese government led by Sadiq al-Mahdi formally submitted its resignation to the Sudanese Supreme Council last night.

	The Supreme Council issued a statement late on the 11th, stating that the resignation of the Mahdi government makes it possible to implement the 7-point political plan signed by various political and military factions in Sudan. The statement calls on various political factions in Sudan to quickly coordinate their positions, protect the democratic system, and reach a consensus on the formation of a new government.

	The final formal resignation of the Mahdi government is directly related to the military's submission of a strongly worded third "memorandum" yesterday. The military demands that the Supreme Council respond to their three questions within 72 hours: whether the political factions are deliberately delaying the resolution of the current crisis; whether the political factions have the sincerity to implement the 7-point political plan; and whether the current government has resigned to the Supreme Council.

	According to an official from the Supreme Council, the resignation of the current Sudanese government does not include Sadiq al-Mahdi himself.

　　苏丹政府辞职
    最高委员会呼吁各方尽快协调
    本报开罗３月１２日电  记者林皎明报道：据此间电台广播，苏丹最高委员会今天正式接受以迈赫迪总理为首的苏丹现政府的辞呈。以迈赫迪总理为首的苏丹现任政府是在昨天晚间向苏丹最高委员会正式提出辞呈的。
    最高委员会１１日晚发表公报指出，迈赫迪政府辞职使苏丹政军各界签署的７点政治计划有实现的可能。公报呼吁苏丹国内各政治派别尽快协调立场、保护民主体制，就新政府的组成达成一致意见。
    迈赫迪政府的最后正式辞职，与军界昨天提出措辞强硬的第３份“备忘录”有直接因果关系。军界要求最高委员会在７２小时内必须回答他们的３个问题，即政界是否故意拖延解决目前危机；政界有无诚意贯彻７点政治计划；现任政府是否已向最高委员会辞职。
    据最高委员会官员宣布，现任苏丹政府辞职不包括迈赫迪本人。
