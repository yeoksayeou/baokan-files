There are many people in life who do not know how to rest. To a large extent, this is due to a lack of correct understanding of what rest is. Summarized, the misconceptions about rest are as follows:

Static immobility is rest. Many people think that being physically still is rest. This understanding is incomplete. Because, the meaning of rest is to temporarily stop work, study, or activity. If a mental worker lies in bed or sits on a sofa, continuously thinking about problems, and using a lot of brainpower, this is not rest. On the contrary, if it is not like this, but lying or sitting there chatting with others, or closing one's eyes to relax, or enjoying music, these are all forms of rest.

Entertainment is the best rest. Appropriate entertainment can relax the body and mind, and should be considered a good form of rest. However, if the entertainment is not appropriate, including excessive entertainment, prolonged duration, or entertainment with gambling elements, these are not rest and are harmful to the body.

The more rest, the better. Rest is the recovery of the body and mind (brain). The length or amount of time should be based on the degree of fatigue. For example, a university student who has attended two consecutive classes needs only a ten to fifteen minute break. For adults, working eight hours during the day and sleeping eight hours at night is sufficient. If the rest time is too long, or if one sleeps more than eight to nine hours every night, leading to a decrease in physical activity time and a weakening of bodily functions, it can easily lead to various diseases and is also an important cause of obesity.

### 人对休息误解多

　　人对休息误解多
    生活中到处都有不会休息的人。不会休息很大程度上与对休息缺乏正确的认识有关。归纳起来，对休息的误解有以下几种。
    静止不动就是休息，许多人以为身体静止不动就是休息，这种理解是不全面的。因为，休息的含义是暂时停止工作、学习或活动。如果一个脑力劳动者躺在床上或坐在沙发上，持续思考问题，大动脑筋，就不是休息。相反，如果不是这样，而是躺在或坐在那儿与别人聊天，或闭目养神，或欣赏音乐，这些都是休息。
    娱乐是最好的休息，适当的娱乐，可以使身心放松，应该说是一种很好的休息。但是，如果娱乐不当，包括娱乐无度，持续时间过长，或带有赌博性质的娱乐，都不是休息，对身体有害而无益。
    休息越多越好，休息是身心（脑）的休整，时间的长短或多少要根据疲劳的程度。比如，大学生连续上了两节课，课间休息十至十五分钟就够了。对于成年人来说，白天工作了八个小时，晚上睡八小时足矣。如果休息时间长，或每晚睡眠超过八至九个小时，导致体力活动时间减少，机体机能减弱，容易引起多种疾病，也是肥胖的重要原因。　　（２月１１日《工人日报》韩绍安文）
