Such Individual Fast Food Stalls

Rice is packed in snake-skin bags; vegetables are served in old canned food boxes; a fruit basket is used as a fast food stall. "Who cares about hygiene? As long as we can make money!" With a few shouts, these unlicensed fast food stalls can attract customers. This is what I witnessed at the Wuchang Railway Station Square. The Food Hygiene Law has been in effect for many years. Shouldn't these unlicensed fast food stalls, which do not meet food hygiene standards and sell food indiscriminately, harming people's health, be shut down?

### 如此个体快餐摊

　　如此个体快餐摊
       饭，用蛇皮袋装着；菜，用旧罐头盒盛着；用个水果筐一装，就算是个快餐摊了。“管它卫生不卫生，只要能赚到钱！”随着几声吆喝，这些个体快餐摊也能招徕顾客。这就是我在武昌火车站广场的所见所闻。食品卫生法已公布多年了，像这种不具备饮食卫生条件，随意兜售食品，有损人们身体健康的无照个体快餐摊，难道不应当取缔？
