Hainan is forging a new path for building a large special economic zone. This is what the National People's Congress representatives, Provincial Party Secretary Xu Shijie, and Governor Liang Xiang revealed during an interview with a reporter.

What is new about this approach? Unlike other special economic zones, Hainan is not focusing on individual projects for introduction and cooperation. Instead, it is learning from the experiences of special economic zones like Shenzhen, and combining this with Hainan's economic characteristics—weak economic foundation but abundant resources. The plan is to designate several areas along the coast with convenient transportation for foreign investors to develop in large blocks. By implementing internationally proven management methods, Hainan aims to use these areas to radiate and demonstrate the potential, driving the entire special economic zone to take off.

Yangpu is the demonstration point and breakthrough for the development zone. The plan covers 100 square kilometers, with 30 square kilometers to be developed by the famous Kumagai Group Limited. Other international financial groups are also interested in Yangpu. In addition to implementing the relevant policies of the Hainan Special Economic Zone, Yangpu Development Zone will be even more open in other aspects. Foreign investors will have full operational and management rights, and the legal rights of foreign investors and expatriates in the development zone will be protected by Chinese law. However, China retains sovereignty over the development zone, and all foreigners must abide by Chinese laws and regulations. Development projects must also comply with China's resource laws and environmental protection laws. The state will dispatch customs authorities to take necessary measures for supervision.

To promote the construction of the development zone and attract investors, Hainan is making great efforts to strengthen infrastructure construction and improve the investment environment.

　　海南正走出办大特区新路        
    划出若干区域让外商承包开发 
    推行国际管理法带动特区起飞
    本报讯  记者高新庆报道：海南正走出一条办大特区的新路子。这是全国人大代表、省委书记许士杰、省长梁湘接受记者采访时透露的。
    新在哪里？与其他特区不同，不是一个项目一个项目的引进、合作，而是学习深圳等特区经验，结合海南经济基础差、底子薄，但资源丰富的特点，在沿海交通便利的地区划出若干区域，让外商成片承包开发，放手推行国际上行之有效的管理办法，以其辐射和示范作用，带动整个特区起飞。
    洋浦是开发区的示范点和突破口。规划１００平方公里，其中３０平方公里将由著名的熊谷组有限公司承包，国际其他大财团也对洋浦颇感兴趣。洋浦开发区除实行海南特区的有关政策外，在其他方面将更加放开，外商有充分的经营管理权，外国投资者和外籍人员在开发区的合法权益受到中国法律的保护。但中国拥有开发区主权，一切外籍人都要遵守中国的法律、法规，开发的项目也要合乎我国的资源法、环保法。国家派海关机构，采取必要的手段实行监督。
    为促进开发区建设和吸引投资者，海南正下大力强化基础设施建设和改善投资环境。
