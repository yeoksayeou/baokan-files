	Mirage of the Sea
	Meyuan

	Last autumn, a mirage appeared on the sea near Penglai in Shandong. Someone recorded it on video. But the television footage was just a flash, and it was not clear.

	Not long after, at the "Penglai Fairyland Photography Exhibition," I saw two photographs of the mirage. I stared at these two precious photographs for a long time, and my thoughts became as elusive as the mirage itself.

	Penglai is a place where mirages often appear. During the reign of Emperor Zhezong of the Song Dynasty, Su Shi was transferred to the position of Prefect of Dengzhou. He stayed there for only five days. According to him, because he prayed devoutly, the heavens were moved, and the mirage specially appeared for him. He wrote a long poem called "Sea Mirage." Perhaps this man was being mysterious, or perhaps he really had this fortunate encounter. I won't dwell on it, but the poem is very good. "The eastern sea is empty and vast, the immortals appear and disappear in the clear sky. The floating world creates countless illusions, how can there be palaces and pearls hidden in the sky?" He did not believe that there were really any buildings in the sky, thinking it was just an illusion created by the floating world. It cannot be denied that this is a profound insight. The sensitive antennae of poetry often reach the forefront of science, and this is an example.

	In the autumn of 1982, I climbed Penglai Pavilion, thinking it would be great to see a mirage. But looking far away, the sea and sky merged into one, vast and empty; looking close, the waves crashed against the shore, and flowers and snow flew. There was not even a trace of a mirage. Embedded in the wall were stone carvings, including Su Shi's handwritten poem "Sea Mirage," and the words "The sea does not raise waves." These four characters were written by a certain official during the Opium War. During the Battle of the Yellow Sea, a Japanese warship fired a cannon that hit the character "不," leaving a clear crack. Seeing this crack, my interest in appreciating the mirage vanished. I once wrote a poem: "Blood like a tide from a hundred battles, winning the sea that does not raise waves. Try to peel off the moss and see the cannon marks, dare to sing in peace after such a victory!"

	This time, although I was looking at photographs, I really saw it. So, this is what a mirage looks like. It's as if there's a thin layer of mist, and in the distance, you can see a tall castle or a deep palace. The outer contours are clearly visible, even the eaves can be distinguished, but inside the contours, it's all dark green, and nothing can be seen. Perhaps inside, there are giant pearls, two-meter-long corals, rows of dragon livers and phoenix marrow, and wine that grants eternal life; perhaps inside, there is a feast, with green phoenixes and white cranes, all the immortals gathered, with jade flutes and golden pipes, and heavenly maidens dancing; but perhaps it is a flying saucer from outer space, inhabited by highly intelligent extraterrestrial creatures. Who knows?

	What is a mirage? To the ancients, it was very mysterious. The "Biyi" says: "The shen is shaped like a large snake, with scales all reversed below the waist. Some say it looks like a dragon with ears and horns, a red mane on its back. It breathes out air to form towers and pavilions, which look red and green in the distance, as if in smoke and fog. High-flying birds, when tired, rest there to catch their breath, and when they are happy, they come, but their breath is sucked down, and they fall." Look, the shen originally had horns and ears, a red mane on its back, and was a large sea monster resembling a snake. The mirage was originally formed by its breath, and was a trap it set to catch flying birds. The sea is full of fish, but for some reason, it must catch flying birds. This story is strange and somewhat terrifying, how interesting! If someone caught such a creature and kept it in a pond, letting it spit out towers for people to admire, it would surely cause a sensation around the world. Unfortunately, science has proven that mirages are just reflections of certain places on land, reflected onto the sea by light, which is really disappointing. There are not just a few instances where beautiful myths have been made disappointing by science.

	Fortunately, science not only makes illusions disappear but also turns illusions into reality. I remember that when I climbed Penglai Pavilion, I wrote a poem expressing the strange idea of building a mirage park on the sea. Now it seems that this idea is still too narrow. The wings of my poetry can never soar beyond the range of ordinary birds. Perhaps this is why I can never write good poetry.

	Let's open our minds, in a few decades, a few hundred years, a few thousand years, humans will build huge cities on the sea and under the sea, build space cities in outer space, build a mountain-view hotel on the moon, and build a grand theater on Pluto. People may be able to live in houses in the deep layers of the Pacific Ocean, have lunch on the moon, and go to the theater on Pluto in the evening. Building a mirage park is like a mustard seed, what is that? Even the mirage seems narrow and crude, only worthy of being a low-grade handicraft sold on a street stall. At that time, if I am still alive, I will definitely write a new poem, write it into a banner that covers the sky and hang it on Mount Everest. If I practice for another 1,000 years, my poetry will surely surpass Li Bai; my calligraphy will also surpass Wang Xizhi.

　　海市茫想
    梅苑
    去年秋季，山东蓬莱的海面上出现了海市蜃楼，有人摄制了录像。但电视镜头只是一闪，看不真切。
    不久以后，在“蓬莱仙境摄影展”上看到了两幅海市的照片。我面对这两幅珍贵的照片端详了很久，思绪也如同那蜃楼一样缥缈起来。
    蓬莱是海市容易出现的地方。宋哲宗年间，苏轼调任登州刺史，在这里只呆了五天。据他说，因为他虔心祈祷感动了上天，海市特地为他出现。他写了一首长诗《海市》。也许是此公故弄玄虚，也许是真的有这一番巧遇，不去管它，诗是写得很好的。“东方云海空复空，群仙出没空明中。荡摇浮世生万象，岂有贝阙藏珠宫？”他不相信海上真的有什么空中楼阁，认为不过是浮世生出的幻影，不能不说是一种高明的见解。诗的敏感的触角往往能够跑到科学的前头，这就是一例。
    １９８２年秋，我登上了蓬莱阁，心想要能够看到海市该多好。但远看海天相接，一派清空，近看惊涛拍岸，飞花溅雪，连一点海市的影子也没有。嵌在墙上的石刻，有东坡手书《海市》诗，还有“海不扬波”四个字。这四个大字是鸦片战争时某守官所书。甲午海战时，日舰发炮击中“不”字，裂痕赫然在焉。看到这裂痕，观赏海市的雅兴索然了。曾写诗道：“碧血如潮百战多，赢来大海不扬波。炮痕试剥苍苔看，敢放承平入醉歌！”
    这一回，看的虽然是照片，却真的看到了。海市，原来是这个样子的。好像隔着一层薄薄的雾，远望一处高大的城堡，或者一处深邃的楼阁。外部的轮廓看得分明，连檐角都可以辨认，可轮廓以内一色青黑，什么也看不清楚。说不定那里面陈设着斗大的珍珠、丈二的珊瑚，罗列着龙肝凤髓，还有饮一杯就寿逾千春的美酒；说不定那里面正在宴饮，青鸾白凤，群仙毕至，玉萧金管，天女飞回；然而也说不定那是来自天外的飞行器，里边住着智能很高的外星怪物，谁知道呢？
    海市是怎么回事？在古人看来是很神秘的。《埤雅》说：“蜃，形似蛇而大，腰以下鳞尽逆。一说状似螭龙，有耳有角，背鬣作红色。嘘气成楼台，望之丹碧隐然，如在烟雾。高鸟倦飞，就之以息，喜且至，气辄吸之而下，今俗谓之蜃楼”。你看，蜃原来有角有耳，背生红毛，是形似大蛇的一种海怪，蜃楼原来是它嘘气而成的，是它捕食飞鸟设下的圈套。海里有的是鱼，但不知为什么非捕食飞鸟不可。这故事奇异还带着几分恐怖，多有意思！假如有谁捕到这么一只池养起来，让它吐出楼台供人观赏，准会哄动全世界。可惜科学已经证明，海市蜃楼不过是光把陆地上某一处所折射到海上的幻影，实在扫兴。美丽的神话传说，被弄得扫兴的事，不止这一件。
    好在科学不但能使幻影破灭，还能够把幻影变成实体。记得我那次登蓬莱阁曾写过一首词，发出在海上建筑一处海市公园的奇想。现在看来，这想法还是太狭小了。我的诗的翅膀总是超不出凡鸟所及的范围，这也许是我总写不出好诗来的缘故吧。
    把思想放开去，几十年，几百年，几千年，人类会在海上和海底建造起巨大的城市，会在外层空间建造起太空城，在月亮上建造起环山饭店，在冥王星上建造起大剧院。人们也许可以居住在太平洋深层的住宅里，午饭在月亮上吃，晚上到冥王星上去看戏。建造一个海市公园犹如芥子，算个什么？连海市也显得狭小拙劣，只能算是小摊上出卖的低档工艺品了。那时候如果我还在，一定要重新写一首诗，写成铺天盖地的条幅挂在珠穆朗玛峰上。如再练上１０００年，我的诗笃定会超过李太白；字，也会超过王羲之的。
    在人生的道路上浮现着许多海市的幻影，在人类发展的道路上也浮现着许多海市的幻影。切不要责怪它们荒唐诡异，也不要责怪迷恋幻影的人幼稚可笑。正是这些幻影诱导着历史前进。但要小心，有的幻影是蜃气化成的楼台，要想跑过去拥有这楼台，却不免葬身海怪之腹。
