	“Adapting to national conditions” originally advocated for seeking truth from facts, but sometimes it is used as an excuse to protect backwardness. At the beginning of implementing the “household responsibility system” in rural areas, some people emphasized “adapting to national conditions” and insisted that “the people’s commune is good.” When urban enterprises implemented “contracting,” some people used “adapting to national conditions” to cling to the “iron rice bowl.” Now, when promoting competitive selection and differential elections for officials, some people bring it up again, wanting to continue being “judges of horses.”

	I support the idea that any reform must “adapt to national conditions.” It conforms to dialectics and is the experience gained by many generations at a cost. Ignoring national conditions and acting recklessly will only lead to more painful repetition of this experience. However, this does not mean that any “national conditions” should be adapted to and not changed; nor does it mean that adapting to national conditions will bring about the “Four Modernizations” from the sky.

	Our “national conditions,” apart from the necessity to adhere to the “Four Cardinal Principles,” I think there are at least two more points: one is that there are too many feudal elements; the second is that we are too poor and too backward. Reform is actually about transforming these backward “national conditions.” The current problem is that while there is an impatient desire to achieve everything in one step, the more significant issue is that we have adapted to the backward elements in our “national conditions” for too long. Sometimes, it is like trying to adapt to a new skin on old bones, which is impossible.

	To be honest, I do not believe that those who use “adapting to national conditions” as an excuse to protect backwardness do not understand this simple logic. Some common knowledge of dialectics can be understood even by ordinary people. Ask the common people, how many still want to “endure poverty”? How many are reluctant to let go of the old system and find the new system “psychologically unbearable”? Some people’s so-called “adapting to national conditions” is simply about adapting to their own interests. You say that the “iron rice bowl” is bad in every way, but it has one big advantage: it is convenient to be an “official in peace.” You say that competitive selection and differential elections for officials are good in every way, but it has one big disadvantage: mediocre people want to be officials, and studying “flattery” is like seeking fish in a tree. It is clear that those who often use “adapting to national conditions” to scare people do not necessarily not understand “national conditions,” but rather think “what do national conditions have to do with me?”

	Reform, especially political system reform, naturally cannot be as rapid as the “Yellow River’s water.” However, for some slow-paced people, the reason they want to “take it slow” is that their minds are filled with too many old habits. As for those who do not even want to “take it slow” and want to “adapt” in that way for their entire lives, that is another matter.

### “适应国情”析

　　“适应国情”析
     楠客
    “适应国情”本是提倡实事求是，但有时竟被人用作保护落后的借口。农村实行“大包干”伊始，有些人强调“适应国情”，坚持“人民公社好”；城里企业实行“承包”，有些人则借“适应国情”，留恋“大锅饭”；现在推行干部竞争、差额选举，又有些人端出它来，想继续当“伯乐”。
    我是赞成任何改革动作都要“适应国情”的。它符合辩证法，也是多少代人付出代价得出的经验。不顾国情瞎折腾，最后只能更痛苦地重复这个经验。然而，这既不是说任何“国情”都要“适应”，动它不得；也不是说做到了“适应国情”，“四化”便会从天而降。
    我们的“国情”，除了必须坚持“四项基本原则”这一条外，我看至少还有两条：一是封建的东西太多；二是太穷，太落后。改革，实际上就是改造那些落后的“国情”。现在的问题，虽有干什么事都想“一步到位”的急躁情绪，更主要的，恐怕还是对“国情”中落后的成分适应太久，有时候简直像老骨头上的一块新皮，无法适应而硬要适应。
    老实说，我不相信把“适应国情”作为“保护落后”口实的人连这丁点道理都不懂。有些辩证法的常识，白丁也可以无师自通。去问问平头老百姓，有几个还想“安贫”？有几个对旧体制爱不释手，而对新体制都“心理承受能力不够”？有些人所谓的“适应国情”，不过是想适应他自己的利益。你说“大锅饭”这不好那不好，但它有个最大的好处：当“太平官”可方便了；你说干部的竞争、差额选举这好那好，可是它有一个最大的不好：平庸之辈想当官，死啃“马屁学”如同缘木求鱼。可见，动辄以“适应国情”吓人的人中，有些人并非真的不懂“国情”，而是“国情如何关我啥事”。
    改革，特别是政治体制改革，自然不能猛如“黄河之水”，欲速往往不达。然而，对某些慢节奏者来说，之所以要“慢慢来”，乃是因为他们自己头脑里积习太多；至于那些连“慢慢来”也不肯，一辈子就想那样“适应”下去的人，那就是另一回事了。
