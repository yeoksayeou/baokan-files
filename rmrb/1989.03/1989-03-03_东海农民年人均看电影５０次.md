Last year, the number of movie-goers in Donghai County, Jiangsu Province, reached 45 million. With a population of 800,000 farmers, the average number of movies watched per person was over 50.

Located in northern Jiangsu, Donghai County was once known for its cultural poverty. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the cultural life has become rich and colorful. There are over 500 villages in the county, and each village has a movie screening point.

    东海农民年人均看电影50次
    去年，江苏省东海县看电影的观众达4500万人次，全县80万农民人均看电影在50次以上。
    位于苏北地区的东海县，过去是有名的文化贫困县。党的十一届三中全会以来，文化生活丰富多彩，全县500多个乡村，每个乡村有一个放映点。
