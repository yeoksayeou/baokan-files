To March 13th of this year, the European Currency Unit (ECU, abbreviated as ECU) has been in existence for 10 years. In just 10 short years, it has demonstrated remarkable vitality and gained increasing favor in the international financial market.

The European Currency Unit is a "basket currency" created by the European Community, which has the substance of a currency but does not issue banknotes. It is primarily used for mutual settlements between the central banks of member countries and can also be used as foreign exchange reserves by member countries. Over the past 10 years, the European Currency Unit has "earned its own position" and far exceeded its originally defined scope of use. Its total bank assets have surged from over $70 billion in 1982 to more than $100 billion by March 1988. In the capital market, the issuance of European Currency Unit bonds has also made significant progress. When European Currency Unit bonds were first issued in 1981, people were still cautious, and the issuance amount was limited. However, starting from 1982, the situation changed significantly. To date, the total issuance of European Currency Unit bonds has exceeded $33 billion. In countries like the United States, Japan, and Canada, European Currency Unit bonds have also become popular. Deposits, loans, credit cards, and traveler's checks in European Currency Units have also rapidly expanded and are welcomed by people both within and outside the European Community.

In international trade, the use of the European Currency Unit is also becoming increasingly widespread. Since 1980, the Saint-Gobain Industrial Group in France has used the European Currency Unit to set product prices in some of its subsidiaries. In 1987, several large French companies, including Total, began using it for daily transactions. Last May, the International Air Transport Association also decided to use the European Currency Unit as a means of settlement.

It is worth noting that due to the strong development momentum of the European Currency Unit, the attitude of the West German banking authorities towards it has also changed. Starting from June 1987, they allowed West German citizens to open European Currency Unit accounts in banks.

The European Currency Unit has achieved such rapid development mainly because of its stable value. It is composed of multiple currencies, and the fluctuations of individual currencies have little impact on it. Moreover, its value is not only stable but also rising. For example, from September 1985 to the end of 1987, its exchange rate against the U.S. dollar rose by 64%. In addition, the interest rates of the European Currency Unit are fair, and using this currency for financing can reduce the risk for users. For these reasons, some people estimate that by 1995, the European Currency Unit may become the unified currency of the European Community.

　　“篮子货币”受青睐
      姚立
    到今年３月１３日，欧洲货币单位（ＥＣＵ简称埃居）已经诞生１０年了。在短短的１０年中它展示出了强大的生命力，在国际金融市场得到越来越多人的青睐。
    欧洲货币单位是欧洲共同体创设的一种有货币之实、但不发行钞票的“篮子货币”，主要用于各成员国中央银行的互相结算，也可用作成员国的外汇储备。１０年来，欧洲货币单位“已经赢得了自己的地位”，并大大超出了原定的使用范围，其银行资产总额已从１９８２年的７０多亿美元猛增到１９８８年３月的１０００亿之多。在资本市场上，欧洲货币单位的债券发行量也有了较大突破。１９８１年，欧洲货币单位债券刚发行时，人们还多持谨慎态度，发行金额有限。但从１９８２年起，形势发生较大变化，迄今，欧洲货币单位的债券发行总额超过３３０亿美元。在美、日和加拿大等国，欧洲货币单位的债券也成了抢手货。欧洲货币单位的存款、放款、信用卡和旅行支票等业务也迅速扩大，受到欧共体内外国家人们的欢迎。
    在国际贸易中，欧洲货币单位的使用也日益广泛。法国的圣·戈班工业集团从１９８０年起即在一些国家的子公司间用欧洲货币单位标定产品价格。１９８７年，法国道达尔等几家大企业更把它用于日常交易之中。去年５月，国际航空运输协会也决定用欧洲货币单位作为结算的一种手段。
    值得一提的是，由于欧洲货币单位强劲的发展势头，西德银行当局对它的态度也在发生变化，于１９８７年６月开始准许西德公民在银行开设欧洲货币单位的户头。
    欧洲货币单位所以取得这样迅速的发展，主要是因为它的币值稳定。它由多国货币组成，个别货币币值的变化对其影响不大。不仅如此，它的币值还稳中有升。例如，从１９８５年９月至１９８７年底的２年多中，它对美元的汇价就上升了６４％。此外，欧洲货币单位的利率公平，用这种货币筹资，可以减少用户的风险。正因如此，有人估计，到１９９５年，欧洲货币单位将可能成为欧共体的统一货币。
