In 1988, China's national economy developed in the context of deepening reforms and accelerating opening-up. Economic strength was further enhanced, foreign economic exchanges expanded, and education, science and technology, culture, and healthcare saw new developments. Preliminary calculations show that the national income for the year was 13,853 billion yuan, up 11.2% from the previous year; national income was 11,533 billion yuan, up 11.4%. The main issues in the national economy's development were: excessive social demand, worsening supply-demand imbalances and structural contradictions, and rapid price increases leading to noticeable inflation. In the fourth quarter, various regions and departments made significant efforts in implementing the policy of rectifying the economic environment and order, achieving some initial results.

I. Agriculture

In 1988, the total agricultural output value was 5,618 billion yuan, up 3.2% from the previous year. Among these, the output value of crop farming decreased by 0.5%, forestry increased by 3.8%, animal husbandry increased by 10.5%, sideline production increased by 10.4%, and fishery increased by 11.8%.

Major agricultural products saw varying degrees of decrease in production, but grain and cotton production were better than initially anticipated. Sugar crops saw a significant increase in production, reversing two consecutive years of decline. Some regions saw excessive increases in tobacco planting areas. The contradiction between agriculture and the overall economic development further intensified.

The production of major agricultural products is as follows:

		1988		Percentage Increase from Previous Year
Grain		39,401 million tons		-2.2
Cotton		4.20 million tons		-1.1

Sugar beet		13.29 million tons		63.2
Hemp		1.08 million tons		-4.8
Tobacco		2.33 million tons		42.4
Silkworm cocoons		0.44 million tons		9.3
Tea		0.54 million tons		7.2
Fruits		16.62 million tons		-0.4

Afforestation and greening efforts saw new progress. The second phase of the "Three-North" Shelterbelt Project exceeded the annual afforestation target, coastal shelterbelt construction showed initial results, and artificial shelterbelt strips in plain areas saw significant development. However, illegal logging continued to occur frequently in some areas.

In livestock farming, pig raising rebounded, with the number of pigs sent to market and the number of pigs in stock both increasing. The production of major products such as meat, poultry, eggs, and milk continued to increase. The number of grass-eating livestock continued to grow. However, due to the increase in feed prices, pig production was not stable.

The production of major livestock products and the number of livestock are as follows:

		1988		Percentage Increase from Previous Year
Pork, beef, mutton		21.88 million tons		10.2
Milk		3.69 million tons		11.7
Wool		2.24 million tons		7.3
Pigs sent to market		275 million head		5.2
Large livestock at year-end		125 million head		2.9
Pigs at year-end		342 million head		4.4
Sheep at year-end		201 million head		11.4

Fishery production continued to develop. The total aquatic product output for the year was 10.46 million tons, up 9.5% from the previous year. Of this, freshwater product output increased by 11.1%, and marine product output increased by 8.4%.

Agricultural production conditions improved. By the end of 1988, the total agricultural machinery power nationwide was 26.48 billion watts, up 6.6% from the previous year; large and medium-sized tractors totaled 860,000 units, down 1.9%; small and walk-behind tractors totaled 5.98 million units, up 12.7%; trucks totaled 590,000 units, up 7.5%; irrigation and drainage machinery power totaled 6.55 billion watts, up 4.7%; fertilizer application was 21.42 million tons, up 7.1%; agricultural plastic film was 337,000 tons, up 17.5%; rural electricity consumption was 72.2 billion kWh, up 9.6%. Agricultural water conservancy construction was strengthened.

The overall rural economy saw new developments. In 1988, the total rural social output value was 12,078 billion yuan, up 12.9% from the previous year. Of this, the output value of rural industry, construction, transportation, and commerce increased by 22.5%, with their share rising from 50.4% the previous year to 53.5%, while the share of agricultural output value decreased from 49.6% to 46.5%.

II. Industry

In 1988, the total industrial output value was 18,100 billion yuan, up 20.7% from the previous year; excluding village and below-village industries, it was 15,181 billion yuan, up 17.7%. In the total industrial output value, state-owned industry grew by 12.7%, collective-owned industry grew by 8% (of which rural industry grew by 35%), individual industry grew by 46%, and jointly-owned, cooperative, and foreign-invested industries grew by 97%.

The development of light industry accelerated in 1988, with a total output value of 8,950 billion yuan, up 22.6% from the previous year. This was mainly due to the rapid growth of light industry using non-agricultural products as raw materials, and the even faster growth of various high-grade durable consumer goods. Heavy industry also developed at a relatively high speed, with a total output value of 9,150 billion yuan, up 18.8% from the previous year. Among these, processing industry grew even faster, far exceeding the growth of energy and raw material industries, leading to further intensification of structural contradictions in industrial production.

In 1988, state-owned industrial enterprises under the budget realized profits and taxes of 155.8 billion yuan, up 17.4% from the previous year; the turnover days of fixed working capital were reduced from 104 days the previous year to 97 days; the labor productivity of all employees increased by 9.3%; the quality of most products remained stable; energy consumption continued to decrease, with the industrial sector saving 30 million tons of energy, achieving a 5.6% energy-saving rate. However, the comparable product costs of state-owned industrial enterprises under the budget increased by 12.3%, and the losses of loss-making enterprises increased by 26.6%.

Industrial enterprise reforms achieved new results. In 1988, 9,024 state-owned large and medium-sized industrial enterprises implemented the contract responsibility system, with profits and taxes increasing by 20.8% from the previous year. Some enterprises began piloting the shareholding system. By the end of 1988, there were 10,804 horizontal economic alliances among industrial enterprises at the county level and above nationwide.

III. Fixed Asset Investment and Construction Industry

In 1988, the total fixed asset investment completed nationwide was 431.4 billion yuan, an increase of 67.3 billion yuan, up 18.5% from the previous year; excluding price factors, the actual work volume saw a slight increase. Of this, state-owned units accounted for 269.5 billion yuan, up 17.3%; collective-owned units accounted for 62.1 billion yuan, up 13.5%; individual investments accounted for 99.8 billion yuan, up 25.4%. However, the total scale of ongoing construction investment nationwide remained large, at approximately 1.3 trillion yuan, an increase of 12% from the previous year. This was mainly due to the excessive number of newly started non-key projects and the significant increase in off-budget investments. The work of cleaning up ongoing fixed asset investment projects has achieved some results. Nationwide, 14,400 investment projects were decided to be stopped or slowed down, which can reduce investment in the next few years by 44.2 billion yuan.

The basic construction investment of state-owned units was 154.3 billion yuan, up 14.9% from the previous year. The investment structure saw some changes: the energy industry completed 37.1 billion yuan in investment, with the share increasing from 22.5% the previous year to 24%; the raw material industry completed 20.6 billion yuan in investment, with the share decreasing from 14.6% the previous year to 13.4%; the transportation and postal industry completed 21.8 billion yuan in investment, with the share decreasing from 15.3% the previous year to 14.1%; the light textile industry completed 6.2 billion yuan in investment, the agricultural industry completed 7.1 billion yuan in investment, and the education and health industry completed 9.5 billion yuan in investment, with their shares all seeing a slight decrease from the previous year; the commerce and finance industry completed 8.4 billion yuan in investment, with the share increasing from 5.1% the previous year to 5.5%; the urban construction industry completed 9.4 billion yuan in investment, with the share increasing from 5.9% the previous year to 6.1%. In basic construction investment, production-oriented construction investment was 103.3 billion yuan, with the share increasing from 65.5% the previous year to 66.9%; non-production-oriented construction investment was 51 billion yuan, with the share decreasing from 34.5% the previous year to 33.1%. However, the investment in office buildings and conference halls still increased significantly.

The 203 key projects organized by the state according to reasonable construction periods completed 42.1 billion yuan in investment, up 16.3% from the previous year. Nationwide, 78 large and medium-sized basic construction projects and 138 large and medium-sized project sub-projects were completed and put into operation. The completion and operation of some key power stations, coal mines, railways, ports, and scientific research projects added to the country's modernization construction capabilities.

The main production capacities newly added nationwide in basic construction were: power generation equipment capacity of 9.99 million kW, coal mining of 309 million tons, oil mining of 157.7 million tons (including updated and other investment-increased capacities), ethylene of 600,000 tons, cement of 24.6 million tons, flat glass of 7.92 million standard boxes, railway operational mileage of 419 kilometers, railway double-track mileage of 820 kilometers, electrified railway mileage of 1,487 kilometers, and coastal port handling capacity of 87.8 million tons.

In updated and transformed investment, 37.5 billion yuan was used to increase product production capacity, up 37.4%; 13.5 billion yuan was used to increase varieties, up 24.1%; 4.9 billion yuan was used to improve product quality, up 14.8%; 3.1 billion yuan was used to save energy, up 18.8%. The year saw nearly 40,000 updated and transformed projects completed and put into operation, with newly added fixed assets of 63.4 billion yuan.

The reform of the construction industry deepened. State-owned construction enterprises implemented various economic contract responsibility systems for 119,000 projects, accounting for 83.2% of all construction projects; the construction area was 1.7 billion square meters, accounting for 85.6% of all construction areas. Of these, the bidding and contracting of single projects and construction areas accounted for 21.6% and 28.6% of the contracted projects and construction areas, respectively. In 1988, the total industrial output value of state-owned construction units completed was up 1.7% from the previous year, and the labor productivity of all employees increased by 1.8%.

　　１９８８年国民经济和社会发展统计公报
    中华人民共和国国家统计局
    （１９８９年２月２８日）
    １９８８年，我国国民经济在深化改革、加快对外开放中发展，经济实力进一步增强，对外经济交流扩大，教育、科技、文化、卫生事业有了新的发展。初步计算，全年国民生产总值①１３８５３亿元，比上年增长１１．２％；国民收入１１５３３亿元，比上年增长１１．４％。国民经济发展中的主要问题是：社会需求过旺，供求总量矛盾和结构性矛盾加剧，物价上涨过猛，出现了明显的通货膨胀。进入第四季度，各地区、各部门在贯彻执行治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序方针中，做了不少工作，初步获得一些成果。
    一、农业
    １９８８年农业总产值５６１８亿元，比上年增长３．２％；其中种植业产值下降０．５％，林业产值增长３．８％，牧业产值增长１０．５％，副业产值增长１０．４％，渔业产值增长１１．８％。
    主要农产品产量中，粮、棉、油有不同程度减产，但粮食、棉花生产比原来预料的要好；糖料有较大幅度增产，扭转了连续两年减产的局面；部分地区烤烟面积增加过猛。农业与国民经济发展不相适应的矛盾进一步加剧。
    主要农产品产量如下：
    　　　　　　　　　　１９８８年　比上年增长百分比
　　粮　食　　　　　　　　３９４０１万吨　　　　－２．２
　　棉　花　　　　　　　　　　４２０万吨　　　　－１．１
　　油　料　　　　　　　　　１３２０万吨　　　　－１３．６
　　　其中：油菜籽　　　　　５０４万吨　　　　－２３．８
　　甘　蔗　　　　　　　　　４９０８万吨　　　　  ３．６
　　甜　菜　　　　　　　　　１３２９万吨　　　　  ６３．２
　　黄红麻　　　　　　　　　１０８万吨　　　　－４．８
　　烤　烟　　　　　　　　　　２３３万吨　　　　  ４２．４
　　蚕　茧　　　　　　　　　　　４４万吨　　　　  ９．３
　　茶　叶　　　　　　　　　　　５４万吨　　　  　７．２
　　水　果　　　　　　　　　１６６２万吨　　　　－０．４
    造林绿化有新的进展。“三北”防护林二期建设工程超额完成当年造林任务，沿海防护林建设初见成效，平原地区人造防护林带有显著发展。但一些地方乱砍滥伐林木的现象仍然屡禁不止频繁发生。
    畜牧业生产中，生猪饲养回升，肉猪出栏头数、存栏头数均有增长。肉、禽、蛋、奶等主要产品产量继续增加。草食牲畜持续发展。但由于饲料价格上涨，生猪生产不够稳定。
    主要畜产品产量和牲畜头数如下：
    　　　　　　　　　　　１９８８年　　　比上年增长百分比
　　猪牛羊肉　　　　　　　　２１８８万吨　　　　　　　１０．２
　　牛　奶　　　　　　　　　　３６９万吨　　　　　　　１１．７
　　绵羊毛　　　　　　　　　２２．４万吨　　　　　　　　７．３
　　肉猪出栏数　　　　　　　２．７５亿头　　　　　　　　５．２
　　大牲畜年末数　　　　　　１．２５亿头　　　　　　　　２．９
　　猪年末数　　　　　　　　３．４２亿头　　　　　　　　４．４
　　羊年末数　　　　　　　　２．０１亿只　　　　　　　１１．４
    渔业生产持续发展。全年水产品产量达１０４６万吨，比上年增长９．５％；其中淡水产品产量增长１１．１％，海水产品产量增长８．４％。
    农业生产条件有所改善。１９８８年末全国农业机械总动力达２６４８亿瓦特，比上年增长６．６％；大中型拖拉机８６万台，下降１．９％；小型及手扶拖拉机５９８万台，增长１２．７％；载重汽车５９万辆，增长７．５％；排灌动力机械６５５亿瓦特，增长４．７％；化肥施用量２１４２万吨②，增长７．１％；农用薄膜３３．７万吨，增长１７．５％；农村用电量７２２亿千瓦小时，增长９．６％。农田水利建设有所加强。
    整个农村经济有新的发展。１９８８年农村社会总产值③１２０７８亿元，比上年增长１２．９％；其中农村工业、建筑业、运输业和商业产值增长２２．５％，所占比重由上年的５０．４％上升到５３．５％，农业总产值所占比重则由４９．６％下降为４６．５％。
    二、工业
    １９８８年工业总产值１８１００亿元，比上年增长２０．７％；不包括村及村以下工业为１５１８１亿元，增长１７．７％。在工业总产值中，全民所有制工业增长１２．７％，集体所有制工业增长．８％（其中乡村工业增长３５％），个体工业增长４６％，中外合资、中外合作和外商独资经营的工业增长９７％。
    １９８８年轻工业发展加快，总产值为８９５０亿元，比上年增长２２．６％。主要是以非农产品为原料的轻工业增长快，各种高档耐用消费品增长更快。重工业也以较高的速度发展，总产值达到９１５０亿元，比上年增长１８．８％。其中的加工工业增长更快，大大超过能源、原材料工业的增长，致使工业生产结构性矛盾进一步加剧。
    主要工业品产量如下： 1988年　比上年增长百分比纱　454万吨　3.9布　176亿米　1.7呢绒　2.65亿米　持平机制纸及纸板　1210万吨　6.0糖　455万吨　－10.0原盐　2200万吨　24.7卷烟　3095万箱　7.4合成洗涤剂　129万吨　8.2日用精铝制品　8.57万吨　－19.0自行车　4122万辆　0.1电视机　2485万部　28.5

    １９８８年预算内国营工业企业实现利润和税金１５５８亿元，比上年增长１７．４％；定额流动资金周转天数由上年的１０４天缩短到９７天；全员劳动生产率比上年提高９．３％；多数产品质量保持稳定；能源消耗继续下降，工业部门节约能源３０００万吨，节能率达５．６％。但预算内国营工业企业可比产品成本上升１２．３％，亏损企业的亏损额上升２６．６％。
    工业企业改革取得新的成果。１９８８年全民所有制大中型工业企业实行承包经营责任制的有９０２４个，实现利税比上年增长２０．８％。一些企业开始进行股份制试点。到１９８８年末，全国县以上工业企业中，已有横向经济联合组织１０８０４个。
    三、固定资产投资和建筑业
    １９８８年全国固定资产投资完成４３１４亿元，比上年增加６７３亿元，增长１８．５％；扣除价格因素，实际工作量略有增长。其中全民所有制单位２６９５亿元，增长１７．３％；集体所有制单位６２１亿元，增长１３．５％；个人投资９９８亿元，增长２５．４％。但全国在建工程投资总规模仍然偏大，约１．３万亿元，比上年扩大１２％。主要是新开工的非重点项目过多，预算外投资大量增加。清理固定资产投资在建项目工作已经取得一些成效。全国决定停缓建的投资项目１４４００多个，可压缩今后几年的投资４４２亿元。
    全民所有制单位基本建设投资１５４３亿元，比上年增长１４．９％。投资结构有所变化：能源工业部门完成投资３７１亿元，比重由上年的２２．５％上升到２４％；原材料工业部门完成投资２０６亿元，比重由上年的１４．６％下降为１３．４％；运输邮电部门完成投资２１８亿元，比重由上年的１５．３％下降为１４．１％；轻纺工业部门完成投资６２亿元，农业部门完成投资７１亿元，文教卫生部门完成投资９５亿元，比重均比上年略有下降；商业、金融部门完成投资８４亿元，比重由上年的５．１％上升到５．５％；城市建设部门完成投资９４亿元，比重由上年的５．９％上升到６．１％。在基本建设投资中，生产性建设投资１０３３亿元，比重由上年的６５．５％上升到６６．９％；非生产性建设投资５１０亿元，比重由上年的３４．５％下降为３３．１％。但楼堂馆所投资仍然增加较多。
    国家按合理工期组织建设的２０３个重点项目完成投资４２１亿元，比上年增长１６．３％。全国建成投产的大中型基本建设项目７８个、大中型项目单项工程１３８个。一些重点电站、煤矿、铁路、港口及科研项目的建成投产，为我国的现代化建设增添了后续能力。
    全国基本建设新增加的主要生产能力有：发电装机容量９９９万千瓦，原煤开采３０９０万吨，原油开采１５７７万吨（包括更新改造和其他投资增加的能力），乙烯６０万吨，水泥２４６万吨，平板玻璃７９２万重量箱，铁路交付营业里程４１９公里，铁路复线里程８２０公里，铁路电气化里程１４８７公里，沿海港口吞吐能力８７８万吨。
    企业技术改造稳步前进。１９８８年全民所有制单位完成更新改造投资９５５亿元，比上年增长２５．８％；占全民所有制单位投资比重，由上年的３３％上升到３５．４％。更新改造投资中，用于增加产品生产能力的３７５亿元，增长３７．４％；用于增加品种的１３５亿元，增长２４．１％；用于提高产品质量的４９亿元，增长１４．８％；用于节约能源的３１亿元，增长１８．８％。全年建成投产更新改造项目近４万个，新增固定资产６３４亿元。
    建筑业改革进一步深化。全民所有制建筑施工企业实行各种经济承包责任制的工程达１１．９万个，占全部施工工程的８３．２％；施工面积１．７亿平方米，占全部施工面积的８５．６％。其中投标承包的单位工程和施工面积，分别占承包单位工程和施工面积的２１．６％和２８．６％。１９８８年全民所有制施工单位完成的建筑业总产值比上年增长１．７％，全员劳动生产率提高１．８％。但建筑施工队伍存在窝工现象，亏损企业有所增加。
    地质普查勘探工作取得新成果。１９８８年新发现及有新进展的主要矿产地２８１处，５５个矿种新增加了探明储量，其中煤炭９３亿吨，铁矿７．６亿吨，黄金储量也有增加。油气普查勘探取得较大进展。
    四、运输邮电
    交通运输在紧运行、深挖潜中进一步发展。各种运输工具完成的运输量如下：
　　　　　　　　　　　　１９８８年　　　　　　比上年增长百分比货物周转量　　　　　　　２３３５５亿吨公里　　　　　５．１
　铁路　　　　　　　　　　９８７６亿吨公里　　　　　４．３
　公路　　　　　　　　　　２８７１亿吨公里　　　　　９．５

    铁路部门努力挖潜，扩大了旅客列车编组并增开旅客列车。公路运输部门积极开展长途客运，减轻铁路负担，全国跨省公路客运线已达２５００多条。
    运输部门经济效益进一步改善，运输效率继续提高。铁路货运机车平均日产量８２．９万吨公里，比上年增长１％；铁路运输收入比上年增长６．９％；铁路运输人员劳动生产率提高５％。集装箱运输业务有较快发展，全年铁路和水运完成的集装箱运量达１６５１万吨，比上年增长８％。但运输不适应经济发展的状况进一步加剧，铁路运输长期超负荷运行。交通运输事故较多。
    邮电事业继续发展。１９８８年完成邮电业务总量４９．１亿元，比上年增长２６．３％。年末城市市内电话用户达到３６２万户，比上年末增长２３．５％。
    五、国内商业和物资供销
    商品销售大幅度增长。１９８８年社会商品零售总额７４４０亿元，比上年增长２７．８％；扣除价格上涨因素，实际增长７．９％。在社会商品零售总额中，农业生产资料零售额８９９亿元，增长２７．５％；消费品零售额６５４１亿元，增长２７．９％。全年售予社会集团的消费品零售额达６６５亿元，比上年增长２０．３％。
    各种经济类型商业全面发展。全民所有制零售额增长２９．９％，供销合作社零售额增长２７．９％，其他集体所有制零售额增长２１．２％，合营经济零售额增长２７．７％，个体经济零售额增长３０％，农民对非农业居民零售额增长２９．１％。
    各类消费品零售普遍增长。吃的商品零售额比上年增长２８．２％，穿的商品增长２１．４％，用的商品增长３１．３％；扣除物价上涨因素，吃、穿、用商品分别增长４．３％、７．７％和１３．２％。受通货膨胀和抢购风影响，不少消费品零售量超常增长。其中粮食增长８％，食盐增长２０％，肥皂、洗衣粉增长２０％以上，电视机、录音机、电风扇、洗衣机、电冰箱等耐用消费品分别增长２０％至５０％。
    零售物价上涨过猛。１９８８年零售物价总水平比上年上升１８．５％（其中１２月份比上年同月上升２６．７％）。分城乡看，城镇上升２１．３％，农村上升１７．１％。分商品看，食品类价格上升２３％，其中粮食上升１４．１％，肉禽蛋上升３６．８％，鲜菜上升３１．７％，水产品上升３１．１％；衣着类上升１２．７％；日用品类上升１２．２％；药及医疗用品类上升２４．８％；燃料类上升１６．１％；农业生产资料类上升１６．２％。
    １９８８年职工生活费用价格总水平比上年上升２０．７％。
    生产资料需求过旺。全国物资系统销售各种生产资料达２３６２亿元，比上年增长５１％；扣除价格因素，实际增长２４．３％。通过物资系统销售的钢材３９６６万吨，比上年增长１６．４％；木材２９６６万立方米，增长１４．３％；煤炭２７０１５万吨，增长８．８％。生产资料价格上涨幅度大。１９８８年物资部门１５种主要生产资料销售价格总指数比上年上升２１．５％，其中钢材上升２１％，铜上升５０％，铝上升３８．６％。
    市场物价管理中的主要问题是：秩序较混乱，违法经营活动增多，乱涨价现象突出。由于通货膨胀、物价上涨过猛，影响市场稳定，一年内相继出现几次较大的抢购风，致使商品紧缺面扩大。进入第四季度后，市场乱涨价现象有所收敛。
    六、对外经济贸易和旅游业
    据海关统计，１９８８年进出口货物总额达１０２７．９亿美元，比上年增长２４．４％；其中出口总额４７５．４亿美元，增长２０．６％；进口总额５５２．５亿美元，增长２７．９％。扣除不收付外汇的援助捐赠、来料加工和外商作为投资进口等货物后，逆差３０．９亿美元。

    保险事业迅速发展。１９８８年各类财产险承保总额达１７９７０亿元，比上年增长１８．８％；共有７２１６万户家庭参加了家庭财产保险，各种人身保险投保人数已达１５８６７万人。国内财产险业务共处理赔案２６２万件，赔款支出４３亿元，为受灾的企业、家庭和个人及时恢复生产、经营，安排生活，发挥了作用。
    十、人口
    １９８８年全国人口出生率为２０．７８‰，死亡率为６．５８‰，自然增长率为１４．２‰。年末全国总人口为１０９６１４万人，比上年末增加１５４１万人。现正面临人口生育高峰期，育龄妇女人数逐年增多，完成计划生育的预定任务仍然是极其艰巨的。
    注：本公报各项数据是年度的初步统计，都没有包括台湾省。公报所列国民生产总值、国民收入和各项总产值数据，都是按当年价格计算的；比上年增长速度是按可比价格计算的。
