Science is a struggle for truth—Recalling Comrade Li Zhi's Academic Career

Comrade Li Zhi has passed away. However, his spirit of daring to pursue truth and uphold truth has not left us. In the field of history, he was known for his diligent thinking and his honesty and courage in speaking out. His bold statements and innovations were based on his profound study of Marxist and Leninist works, making them always deep and powerful. Some events that happened more than twenty years ago still often come to mind and cannot be forgotten.

I first met Comrade Li Zhi in 1955. At that time, I mainly sought his guidance and assistance in my research work. In late 1960, he was transferred to the position of deputy director of the Institute of Modern History at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and became the editor-in-chief of "Historical Research." I was also transferred there and worked under his leadership in the editorial department, increasing my interactions with him. Through these interactions and conversations, I not only understood his scientific attitude but also learned his approach to observing problems. I remember that when he talked about the state of historical research at the time, he said: Since liberation, we have emphasized guiding historical research with the materialist view of history, which has been very successful. However, there are also some biases. The main issues are the lack of a spirit of seeking truth from facts, too much empty talk, and too little solid research. There is an overemphasis on class struggle and a neglect of historical attitudes, as well as a tendency to modernize ancient peasant wars. These are not conducive to the development of historical studies and are contrary to historical materialism.

At that time, it was an era when "class struggle as the key link" dominated everything. The appearance of these biases in the field of history was not surprising, and everyone had become accustomed to them. Comrade Li Zhi, however, was thinking about these problems and was doing so in connection with the basic principles of Marxism and Leninism. He was also considering and beginning to clarify these issues theoretically. It can also be said that as early as the 1960s, he was already thinking about "rectifying the wrongs and restoring the right path." This is reflected in several articles published in "Historical Research" at that time, which attracted much attention and sparked considerable debate.

First, he invited Comrade Deng Tuo to write "Mao Zedong Thought Opens the Path for the Development of Chinese Historical Science," emphasizing "seeking truth from facts." He stressed that in any work, including historical research, one must adhere to the spirit of seeking truth from facts. At the same time, he personally drafted a speech for Comrade Fan Wenlan at the centenary meeting commemorating the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, titled "Against Empty Talk." When it was published, he made several revisions. I remember that when I saw the proofs, I suggested to Comrade Li Zhi that although I agreed with Comrade Fan's "opposition to empty talk," his article itself was also "empty talk." He said that for now, it had to be like this. If we fired "real shots," wouldn't we hit someone? Now, firing empty shots and talking nonsense is not just one person's problem; it is a tendency. Clearly, "opposing empty talk" was a response to the tendency of empty talk, big talk, false talk, and nonsense, and its meaning was very clear.

Next, he invited Comrade Cai Meibiao to write "On Some Issues in the Discussion of Chinese Peasant Wars," which clearly explained the economic status and living characteristics of ancient peasants, the causes, demands, and prospects of peasant wars, and criticized the tendency to modernize the study of peasant war history. After its publication, it sparked a great debate. Apart from the published critical articles, two incidents left a deep impression on me. One was that Comrade Sun Zuomin was criticized and sent to the countryside for labor after publishing an article criticizing the history of peasant wars. After Cai's article was published, Sun was called back from the countryside, and soon he sent an article agreeing with Cai's views. This incident sparked another debate. The other was that after Comrade Liu Guifu returned from a trip to Nanjing, he told me that a certain leader there was very angry after reading Cai's article, believing that we had relied on peasants to achieve victory and that we had deep feelings for peasants. Denying peasants and peasant wars was "counter-revolutionary." I strongly disagreed with this view and reported it to Comrade Li Zhi. He believed that having feelings for peasants was one thing, but researching the history of ancient peasant wars was another. We are leading a peasant war under the proletariat. If we equate ancient peasant wars with our peasant wars, then ancient peasant wars have no future; they are either suppressed, or they are recruited, or they are transformed into feudal autocracy, like Liu Bang and Zhu Yuanzhang. Are we like that? That kind of argument is not materialism. However, Comrade Cai Meibiao's article was always criticized, and during the Cultural Revolution, it was labeled as a "poisonous weed."

Third, he invited Comrade Ning Ke to write "On Historicism and Class Perspective," mainly to oppose the non-historicism tendency in historical research. In this article, the class perspective is materialism, and historicism is the dialectical view, which was proposed by Comrade Li Zhi. Whether it is accurate can be discussed, but emphasizing that research problems should be approached with a dialectical method is undoubtedly correct. Although Ning's article still emphasized the class perspective, believing that the class perspective is the core of historical materialism, in that era of "class struggle as the key link, year after year, month after month, day after day," proposing "historicism" was a significant shock and a great disrespect. Therefore, it quickly received critical articles from Guan Feng and Lin Yushi, but there were also expressions of agreement. After Ning's article was reprinted in the People's Daily, Comrade Luo Ruiqing had instructed military leaders to read it. After discussing with Comrade Li Zhi, Comrade Ning Ke wrote another article, "On the Historicism of Marxism," further explaining the principles of historicism and emphasizing the class perspective. When I saw the second proofreading, I felt that there was too much emphasis on the class perspective, so I added "one of" after "the class perspective is the main content of historical materialism." Because Marx spoke of historical materialism, he first emphasized that social existence determines social consciousness, and there are also productive forces and productive relations, base and superstructure, and then class and class struggle, so I added "one of." However, this "one of" brought even greater "crimes" and more struggle sessions to Comrades Li Zhi and Ning Ke during the Cultural Revolution.

Regarding the biases in historical research, Comrade Li Zhi had discussed with Comrade Zhou Yang, then the deputy director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee, who was also in charge of the office for science and education textbooks. He asked Comrade Li Zhi to edit a book on Marxist classics on historical science so that everyone could understand the basic views of the classics. The specific work was done by me and several other comrades, and the editorial format was Comrade Li Zhi's opinion. In the arrangement of chapters, apart from chapters on history and historical science, materialist historical view, dialectical law of historical development, etc., the chapter on research methods occupied the most space, including class analysis method, starting from facts, detailed possession of materials, historical attitude to observe problems, concrete analysis of concrete situations, etc. There were also special sections on "upholding scientific nature" and "there is no smooth road in science." After I arranged the table of contents, Comrade Li Zhi made some modifications, such as the subtitles "theory is the guide for research work, not clichés and labels," "indignation cannot promote science, objectivism will lose its way," "despising dialectics cannot avoid punishment, playing with dialectics will lead to sophistry," etc., which were all carefully considered. When collecting the speeches of Marx and Lenin, Comrade Li Zhi required that they be as objective and comprehensive as possible, but there was also selection.

Comrade Li Zhi put a lot of effort into editing this book. His basic idea was to encourage everyone to read more of Marx and Lenin's works and, in the "editor's note," emphasized that readers should "pay attention to what the original author said at what time, in what context, and for what purpose, and correctly understand it." He also suggested that it would be best to check the original text and carefully interpret the original meaning to establish one's understanding on a reliable basis. This fully demonstrated his serious scientific attitude.

However, even such a book was criticized. One of the charges was that "upholding scientific nature" was "opposing revolutionary nature"; another charge was that it only talked about the "class analysis method" and did not mention the "class struggle perspective," which was a "degradation" of the perspective to a method. In fact, revolutionary nature and scientific nature are closely linked. Without scientific nature, there can be no revolutionary nature. Engels once said: "The more science shows itself to be brave and resolute, the more it conforms to the interests and aspirations of the workers." Lenin also said: Historical materialism has never sought to explain everything but only to point out the "method of explaining history." Is this also a degradation and denial of revolutionary nature? Only those who can only talk empty talk and clichés, but do not truly understand the basic principles of Marxism and Leninism, would make such absurd accusations.

On June 3, 1966, the "Central Cultural Revolution Group" fabricated "Seizing the Historical Field Occupied by the Bourgeoisie," which was published as a headline article on the front page of the People's Daily and in a preface to an article criticizing Wu Han on the second page, saying: Since 1961, there has been a new editor-in-chief, and "Historical Research" has become a field occupied by the bourgeoisie, publishing a series of poisonous weeds. Thus, the long-term persecution and struggle against Comrade Li Zhi began.

However, history is the best witness. The several articles mentioned above and that book on historical science are not "poisonous weeds" but are adhering to the basic principles of Marxism and Leninism, opposing leftist empty talk, and are the earliest examples of "rectifying the wrongs and restoring the right path." After the Cultural Revolution ended, Comrade Li Zhi, as the editor-in-chief of "Historical Research," was the first in the academic community to rectify the wrongs and restore the right path, criticize the "Gang of Four," criticize the remnants of feudalism, appeal for the rehabilitation of historians who were persecuted to death, and strive for the development of historical studies. All of this is inseparable from Comrade Li Zhi's unyielding spirit of upholding scientific attitudes. Comrade Li Zhi's spirit of daring to pursue truth and uphold scientific nature is truly worthy of our learning.

　　科学是为真理而斗争的事业
    ——忆黎澍同志学术生涯二三事
    丁守和
    黎澍同志去世了。但是他勇于追求真理、敢于坚持真理的精神，并没有离开我们。在史学界，他是以勤于思考，正直敢言著称的，而他的直言和创新又是基于对马列著作的精湛研究，因而总显得深刻有力。有些事过去二十多年了，但仍然时常回旋于脑际，不能忘怀。
    我认识黎澍同志是在１９５５年，那时主要是在研究工作中向他请教，求得帮助。１９６０年底，他调任中国科学院近代史研究所副所长，主编《历史研究》。我也随之调来，在他领导下负责编辑部工作，接触自然多起来。在这些接触和交谈中，我不仅体会到他的科学态度，而且了解到他观察问题的方法。记得他在谈到当时史学研究的状况时曾说过：解放以来，我们强调用唯物史观指导历史研究是很有成绩的，但也存在一些偏向。主要是缺乏实事求是精神，空洞议论多，扎实研究少，只讲阶级斗争，忽视历史态度，还有将古代农民战争现代化倾向等。这是不利于史学发展的，也是有背于历史唯物论的。
    当时正是“以阶级斗争为纲”统帅一切的时代，在史学界出现这些偏向并不奇怪，大家都习以为常。黎澍同志却思考这些问题，而且是联系马列主义的基本原理进行思考，同时还设想并着手从理论上予以澄清。也可以说还在６０年代初，他就在考虑“拨乱反正”了。这就是那时《历史研究》发表的几篇颇为引人注目，并引起很大争论的文章。
    首先是请邓拓同志写《毛泽东思想开辟了中国历史科学发展的道路》，强调“实事求是”，无论任何工作，包括历史研究工作，都必须坚持实事求是的精神。同时他自己亲自为范文澜同志起草在纪念太平天国一百周年会议上的讲话《反对放空炮》。在发表时又作了多次修改。记得我在看校样时曾向黎澍同志提出，范老“反对放空炮”，我很赞成，不过他的文章本身也是“空炮”。他说现在只能是这样，如果放“实炮”那不打着人了吗！现在放空炮说空话不是哪一个人的问题，而是一种倾向。可见“反对放空炮”，正是反对那种空炮空话乃至大话假话废话等不良倾向，其意义是很清楚的。
    其次是请蔡美彪同志写《对中国农民战争史讨论中几个问题的商榷》，从正面阐明了古代农民的经济地位和生活特点，农民战争的起因、要求和前途等问题，着重批评了农民战争史研究中的现代化倾向。发表后引起很大争论。除已发表的批判文章外，还有两件事给我印象很深。一是孙祚民同志因发表批评农民战争史的文章而受到批判，并下放劳动。蔡文发表后，孙才被从农村调回来，不久他寄来一文赞成蔡文的意见。此事又引起争论。一是刘桂五同志出差南京回来后告诉我，那里某负责人看了蔡文很生气，认为我们就是依靠农民取得胜利的，我们对农民很有感情，否定农民和农民战争就是“反革命”。我很不同意这种意见，并向黎澍同志作了汇报。他认为，对农民有感情是一回事，研究古代农民战争史又是一回事，我们是无产阶级领导的农民战争，如果将古代农民战争和我们的农民战争说得差不多，那么古代农民战争是没有前途的，或被镇压，或受招安，或转化为封建专制，如刘邦、朱元璋，我们是这样吗？那种说法不是唯物论。然而蔡美彪同志的文章却一直受到非议，“文革”中被打成“大毒草”。
    第三是请宁可同志写《论历史主义和阶级观点》，主要是反对历史研究中的非历史主义倾向。其中阶级观点是唯物论，历史主义是辩证法的看法，是黎澍同志提出的。是否确切当然可以讨论，但强调研究问题要用辩证的方法，无疑是对的。宁文尽管还是强调阶级观点，认为阶级观点是唯物史观的核心，但在那“阶级斗争为纲，年年讲，月月讲，天天讲”的年代，提出“历史主义”就是很大的冲击，就是大不敬。因而很快收到关锋、林聿时的批判文章，但也有表示赞同的。宁文在《人民日报》转载后，罗瑞卿同志就曾指示军队领导同志阅读。经与黎澍同志商量，宁可同志又写了《论马克思主义的历史主义》一文，进一步阐明了历史主义原则，同时更强调了阶级观点。我在看二校清样时，觉得讲阶级观点太多，便在“阶级观点是历史唯物主义的主要内容”后面加上了“之一”。因为马克思讲唯物史观，首先是强调社会存在决定社会意识，还有生产力与生产关系，基础与上层建筑，然后是阶级与阶级斗争等，所以加上了“之一”。然而这个“之一”却给黎澍和宁可同志在“文革”中带来更大的“罪责”，更多的批斗。
    对于历史研究中的偏向，黎澍同志曾向当时的中宣部常务副部长周扬同志谈过。周扬同志当时还兼管文科教材办公室的工作。他要黎澍同志编一本关于马克思主义经典作家论历史科学的书，以便让大家了解经典作家的基本观点。具体工作是由我和其他几位同志做的，编辑体例则是黎澍同志的意见。在章节安排上，除历史和历史科学、唯物主义历史观、历史发展的辩证法等章外，占篇幅最多的是研究历史的方法，包括阶级分析法、从事实出发、详细占有材料、用历史态度观察问题、具体情况具体分析等，还特列了“坚持科学性”和“在科学上没有平坦的大道可走”两节。在我排列出目录后，黎澍同志又作了修改，如“理论是研究工作的指南，不是套语和标签”，“义愤不能推进科学，客观主义要迷失方向”，“蔑视辩证法不能不受到惩罚，玩弄辩证法必然通向诡辩主义”等小题，都是经过多次推敲才定下来的。在集录马列的言论时，黎澍同志要求尽量客观全面，但也有选择。
    黎澍同志为编辑这本书是花了很多心思的。他的基本想法是要大家多读些马列的著作，并在“编辑说明”中强调，读者应该“注意原作者是在什么时间，什么场合，为着什么事情而讲这些话的，正确地加以理解”。还提出最好查对原文，细绎原意，使自己的理解建立在可靠的基础上面。充分显示了他的严肃的科学态度。
    然而就是这样一本书，却又被横加指责。罪名之一是，“坚持科学性”即是“反对革命性”；罪名之二是，只讲“阶级分析方法”，未讲“阶级斗争观点”，是把观点“贬低”为方法。实际上，革命性和科学性是紧密结合在一起的，没有科学性也就不可能有革命性。恩格斯就说过：“科学愈是表现得勇敢和坚决，它就愈符合于工人们的利益和向往。”列宁也说过：历史唯物主义从来没有企求说明一切，而只企求指出“说明历史的方法”。难道这也是贬低与否认革命性吗？只有那些只会说空话、套话，而没有真正弄懂马列主义基本原理的人，才会提出这样荒唐的指责。
    １９６６年６月３日，“中央文革小组”炮制的《夺取资产阶级霸占的史学阵地》，以社论形式在《人民日报》头版头条发表，并在第二版一篇点名批判吴晗的材料的前言中说：自从１９６１年来了一个新主编，《历史研究》便成了资产阶级霸占的阵地，发表了一系列大毒草。于是，对黎澍同志的长期的迫害、批判斗争就开始了。
    然而历史是最好的见证。上面提到的那几篇论文和那本论历史科学，决不是什么“大毒草”，而是坚持马列主义基本原则，反对“左”倾空谈，是最早的“拨乱反正”。“文革”结束后，黎澍同志主编的《历史研究》又首先在学术界拨乱反正，批判“四人帮”，批判封建主义遗毒，为遭迫害致死的史学家呼吁平反，为史学的开拓前进而努力，这都是与黎澍同志始终坚持科学态度的大无畏精神分不开的。黎澍同志这种勇于追求真理，敢于坚持科学性的精神，是很值得我们学习的。
