More than 80 representatives and committee members from the literary and artistic circles gathered at the Capital Hotel today to discuss various issues related to the development of Chinese literature and arts. The Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles (Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles) was the organizer of this meeting.

Half an hour before the meeting, Rui Xingwen, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, arrived at the softly lit conference hall. He sat with everyone around a round table, chatting warmly, listening attentively to the opinions of the artists, and sincerely sharing his own views. He praised the artists for their active and realistic performance during the two sessions, and for proposing many practical solutions to the current problems.

The "Several Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Prospering Literature and Art" and the role of culture and arts in modern construction were the focus of many representatives and committee members. Committee members Zhao Tu, Liu Wenxi, Luo Yusheng, and Huang Xinde all mentioned some unhealthy trends in current literature and arts, as well as the difficulties facing national arts and serious arts. Their views are that the state should adopt protective policies for national arts and serious arts, clarify the standards of right and wrong, guide people to implement the Party's literary and artistic policies, and follow the path of serving the people and socialist construction. Guan Shan Yue representative expressed his concerns, saying that the central government now says it will intervene less in literature and arts, which he supports. However, he is worried that the literary and artistic circles might become chaotic without clear standards of right and wrong. He hopes that the central government will intervene where necessary, criticize when needed, and encourage more positive promotion and guidance.

Wu Zuqiang, chairman of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, introduced the recent work of the Federation and the key points of this year's work plan to the attendees. Chen Dengke, Wu Zuguang, Zhou Dexiang, Luo Huilan, Ma Zitong, and Chen Shufang also spoke at the meeting.

　　文艺界人大代表政协委员呼吁        
    民族艺术严肃艺术亟需保护
    据新华社北京３月２６日电  （记者张万象、吴明）文艺界８０多位人大代表、政协委员今天聚会首都宾馆，探讨中国文学艺术发展的种种问题。中国文联是这次聚会的“导演”。
    中共中央书记处书记芮杏文在会前半小时就来到灯光柔和的会议厅，与大家围坐在圆桌前亲切叙谈，认真听取文艺家们的意见，也坦诚地说出自己的看法。他称赞文艺界的朋友们在两会上表现得活跃又实事求是，对当前存在的问题提出了不少实实在在的解决办法。
    《中共中央关于进一步繁荣文艺的若干意见》和文化艺术在现代化建设中的地位作用问题，是许多代表、委员关注的焦点。赵沨委员、刘文西代表、骆玉笙委员、黄新德委员都谈到当前文艺中的一些不健康倾向和民族艺术、严肃艺术面临的困扰。他们的观点是：对民族艺术、严肃艺术国家应该采取保护政策，分清是非标准，引导人们执行党的文艺政策，走为人民服务、为社会主义建设服务的道路。关山月代表力陈心中的忧虑。他说，中央现在说对文艺少干预，我很赞成。现在我怕的就是文艺界乱了，没有是非标准。我希望中央该过问的就过问，该批评的就批评，该鼓励的要鼓励，多做一点正面的提倡和引导。
    吴祖强代表文联主席团，向与会者介绍了文联最近的工作情况和今年的工作计划要点。陈登科、吴祖光、邹德华、罗惠兰、马识途、陈书舫等也在会上先后发言。
