Society Focuses on Transformers Frenzy: Praise and Criticism Mixed
Beijing Television Station Not Planning to Stop Broadcasting the Show

A report by Lai Renqiong from Beijing: After the news that NPC Standing Committee members Hu Dexiu and others suggested stopping the broadcast of "Transformers," various opinions have emerged in society. Beijing Television Station, after considering various opinions, has decided not to stop broadcasting the show.

With the broadcast of the American television advertisement "Transformers," a wave of enthusiasm for Transformers has swept through major cities like Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. In a short time, Transformers series toys and picture books have taken over the toy counters in state-owned department stores and street stalls. Transformers produced in the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are priced from tens of yuan to over a hundred yuan. The expensive Transformers toys have made many parents groan in frustration. Students compare with each other, and if one buys it, the whole class follows. Those who have already bought small ones are clamoring for larger, more expensive ones. During the discussion of the "Import and Export Commodity Inspection Law" at the National People's Congress Standing Committee, some committee members also expressed concern over the large-scale import of Transformers toys by certain departments. For this reason, 20 standing committee members led by Hu Dexiu jointly wrote a letter suggesting that the television station stop broadcasting "Transformers." After the news was published, it immediately sparked various discussions among parents and people from all walks of life.

Recently, the reporter visited Hu Dexiu. She took out a few "Transformers" color picture books and said, "Once, my grandson insisted that I tell him the story of 'Transformers.' I hadn't watched the TV show, but as soon as I looked at the picture book, the pictures and text were not beautiful, the ideas were absurd, promoting war, and the meaning was incoherent, making it impossible to tell. Then I looked at the price, a picture book with only a dozen pages, some priced at eight or nine jiao, some at over one yuan, with print runs all above sixty or seventy thousand copies, the highest reaching 250,000 copies. At the NPC Standing Committee small group meeting, I casually mentioned this matter, and I didn't expect that the fellow committee members who had become grandparents all had the same feeling. Everyone talked about how the TV broadcast time affected children's meals and how the high price of toys exceeded the affordability of ordinary Chinese families. Thus, we put forward several suggestions to the relevant departments."

However, the "Xinmin Evening News" published an article stating that the television show "Transformers" is full of the wisdom, passion, imagination, and masculinity of industrial society. The characters Optimus Prime and Megatron represent justice and tyranny, goodness and aggression, respectively, with clear right and wrong, bringing joy and enlightenment to children that adults cannot understand.

What people are most concerned about is whether the television show "Transformers" will be stopped. The responsible person at Beijing Television Station said in an interview with the reporter, "We take the suggestions of 20 NPC Standing Committee members very seriously, but television shows are different from toys and publications. After our station broadcast this show, it was welcomed by many viewers, especially children. Everyone thinks that this show is good for children's intelligence development and imagination. Therefore, we have reported to the relevant departments and decided to continue broadcasting. As for the report by a foreign news agency that 'the spokesperson of Beijing Television Station said that higher authorities do not allow continued broadcasting,' there is no such thing. Up to now, we have not received any instructions from any higher authorities or leaders to stop broadcasting."

    社会关注变形金刚热褒贬不一
    北京电视台不准备停播电视片
    本报北京3月1日讯　记者赖仁琼报道：人大常委胡德华等建议停播《变形金刚》的消息见报后，在社会上引起褒贬不一的各种议论，北京电视台在听取各种意见后不准备停播该片。
    随着美国电视广告片《变形金刚》的播放，北京、广州、上海等大城市掀起了一股不大不小的金刚热。一时间，变形金刚系列玩具和画册占据了各国营商场的玩具柜台和街头小摊。美国、香港、台湾生产的变形金刚，售价从十几元到100多元。价格昂贵的变形金刚玩具使不少家长叫苦不迭。学生们互相攀比，一人买了，全班都跟着买。已经买了小个儿的，还吵着要大个儿的、价钱更高的。出席全国人大常委会的一些委员在讨论《进出口商品检验法》时，也为某些部门大量进口变形金刚玩具而深感忧虑。为此，以胡德华为首的20位常委联名写信，建议电视台停播《变形金刚》。消息见诸报端后，立即引起了孩子家长和社会各界的种种议论。
    最近，记者走访了胡德华同志。她拿出几本《变形金刚》彩色画册，说，有一次，我的小孙子非让我讲《变形金刚》的故事，我没看过电视，但一看画册，画面、文字不美，思想内容荒谬，宣扬好战，加上意思不连贯，根本没法讲。再一看定价，十几页一本的画册，有的八九角，有的一元多，印数都在六七万册以上，最多的竟达25万册。在人大常委小组会上，我顺便提到此事，没想到同组那些做了爷爷奶奶的常委们都有同感。大家从电视播放时间影响孩子吃饭说到玩具价高超越普通中国家庭的承受力。于是，我们向有关部门提出了几点建议。
    然而，《新民晚报》发表署名文章，认为电视片《变形金刚》充满了工业社会的智慧、热情、幻想和阳刚之气，片中的擎天柱和霸天虎分别代表正义和霸权，善良和好战，是非非常分明，给孩子带来的乐趣和启迪是成人无法理解的。
    人们最关心的是电视片《变形金刚》会不会停播？北京电视台负责人在接受记者采访时说，我们对20位人大常委的建议非常重视，但电视片不同于玩具和出版物，我台播放此片后受到很多观众特别是儿童的欢迎。大家认为该片对儿童智力开发、提高想象力有好处。所以我们已向有关部门打了报告，决定继续播放。至于有家外国通讯社报道“北京电视台新闻发言人说，上面不让继续播放”，根本无此事。直到现在，我们没有接到任何上级部门和领导关于停播的指示。
