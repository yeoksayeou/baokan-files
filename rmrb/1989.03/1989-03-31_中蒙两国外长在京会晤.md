Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Mongolian People's Republic Foreign Minister Tsedenbal Gonbozul today both expressed optimism about the prospects for further development in relations between the two countries.

Gonbozul, at the invitation of Qian Qichen, arrived in Beijing this morning for a visit to China. He is the first Mongolian foreign minister to officially visit China since the establishment of diplomatic relations 40 years ago. Qian Qichen described this visit as a "major event" in the history of Sino-Mongolian relations and believed that the visit would make a "positive contribution" to the further development of friendly cooperative relations between the two countries.

During the afternoon meeting, Qian Qichen pointed out that there are currently "no outstanding issues" between China and Mongolia.

Gonbozul stated that further developing and expanding friendly cooperative relations with China is one of the "main principles" of Mongolia's foreign policy.

The talks lasted for more than two hours in a friendly atmosphere. Qian Qichen said that over the past 40 years, although the development of relations between the two countries has experienced some twists and turns, overall, Sino-Mongolian relations in the fields of politics, economy, trade, culture, and technology have all developed.

Both foreign ministers expressed satisfaction that the common border between China and Mongolia has remained peaceful.

Foreign Minister Gonbozul invited Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to visit Mongolia at a convenient time. Qian Qichen gladly accepted the invitation.

In the evening, Qian Qichen hosted a banquet to welcome Gonbozul and his delegation.

Before the banquet, the two foreign ministers, on behalf of their respective governments, signed three agreements: one on the establishment of the Sino-Mongolian Economic, Trade, and Technology Cooperation Committee, one on mutual visits by citizens of both countries, and one on the re-establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic Consulate General in Hohhot, China.
