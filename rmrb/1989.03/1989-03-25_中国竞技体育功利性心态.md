After the Seoul Olympics, there have been many conflicting opinions about the General Administration of Sport's overemphasis on competitive sports and the resulting phenomena. Summarized, these opinions mainly revolve around reducing the emphasis on gold medals, focusing on the development of mass sports, and the functions of the General Administration of Sport. Among these, the recognition of competitive sports and its role and significance in the overall development of sports is a crucial issue.

For a long time, those who advocate prioritizing the development of competitive sports have emphasized that competitive sports have a strong social utilitarian nature, including political utilitarianism. They believe that gold medals can arouse patriotic fervor and play a special role in revitalizing China. Specifically, they argue that sports funding is limited, and only by concentrating it on competitive sports can the maximum effect be achieved. The "scattershot" approach is not conducive to promoting the overall progress of the sports industry and achieving the goal of becoming a sports powerhouse in this century. They also argue that improving the physical fitness of the entire population requires the joint efforts of all sectors of society, not just the General Administration of Sport.

Sports cannot do without competitive sports, and competitive sports cannot do without gold medals. The key is how we perceive them.

China is currently a developing country with an underdeveloped economy and a relatively low standard of living. However, the Chinese people yearn for prosperity, strength, and the ability to stand among the world's nations. The stark contrast between harsh reality and strong aspirations has created a significant gap. Neither the backward economic development level nor the excellent traditional culture can satisfy the Chinese people's urgent desires. Under this mindset, the Chinese people naturally feel especially proud and even ecstatic about anything that brings them honor. The "May 19th" incident and the Chinese women's volleyball team's "three consecutive championships" and "five consecutive championships" reflect this same mindset from two extremes. This is the manifestation of the political utilitarianism that emphasizes competitive sports and worships gold medals. Thus, competitive sports have been distorted under this mindset, losing their original meaning.

The utilitarian nature of competitive sports is objectively existent. Acknowledging this fact does not mean it possesses objective truth. What is important is that we do not elevate it to an unattainably high position and pursue unrealistic goals. The true value of competitive sports in the overall development of sports lies in the fact that it is a means for humans to strive against themselves and fully demonstrate their physical abilities. Secondly, it can drive and promote the development of mass sports.

Competitive sports can only survive and develop if they are closely related to widespread mass sports. Gold medals only have true meaning and value when they are deeply rooted in the rich soil of mass sports.

　　中国竞技体育功利性心态
    江流水
    汉城奥运会后，人们对体委过于偏重竞技体育及由此而来的一系列现象提出了不少相悖的意见。归纳起来不外是淡化金牌意识，注重发展全民体育等体育功能、体委职能等问题。这中间，对竞技体育的认识和它在整个体育事业发展中的地位和作用是一个重要问题。
    长期以来，持优先发展竞技体育观点的人强调，竞技体育具有强烈的社会功利性，包括政治功利性。认为，金牌可以唤起爱国热情，可以起到振兴中华之特殊作用。具体的根据还有：体育经费有限，只有集中用于竞技体育，才能发挥最大的效用，“撒胡椒面”的办法无助于推动整个体育事业的进步和在本世纪内达到体育强国的目的；全民身体素质的提高，有赖于全社会各方面的共同努力，而非体委独家可以所为。
    体育不能没有竞技体育，竞技体育也不能没有金牌。关键是我们如何认识它。
    中国现在是一个发展中国家，经济不发达，人民生活水平不高。但中国人渴望富裕，渴望强盛，渴望能立于世界民族之林。冷峻的现实与强烈的渴望形成了巨大的反差。落后的经济发展水平和优秀的传统文化都无法满足中国人现实的急切渴望。在这种心态下，中国人自然会为每一件能够使自己荣耀的事而感到特别的自豪，以至疯狂。“五·一九”和中国女排的“三连冠”、“五连冠”从两个极端反映了这种同样的心态。这就是强化竞技体育，崇尚金牌的体育政治功利主义的表现。于是竞技体育在这种心态下被扭曲了，从而失去了它本来的意义。
    竞技体育的功利性是客观存在的，承认这个事实，绝不意味着它具有客观真理性。重要的是我们不能把它抬到无限高的位置上，而做出不切实际的追求。竞技体育对整个体育发展的真正价值在于：它是人类与自身奋争，充分展示人的体能的一种手段。其次，它可以带动和促进整个群众体育的发展。
    竞技体育只有与广泛的群众体育密切相关才能生存发展。金牌也只有深深植根于丰厚的群众体育土壤才具有真正的意义和价值。
