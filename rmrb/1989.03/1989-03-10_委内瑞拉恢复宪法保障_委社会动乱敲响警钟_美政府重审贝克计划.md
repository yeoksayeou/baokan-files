Venezuela Restores Constitutional Guarantees
Venezuela's Social Unrest Rings Alarm Bells; U.S. Government Re-evaluates Baker Plan

CARACAS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government's cabinet decided in a meeting last night that constitutional guarantees for various civil rights would be restored starting today.

The head of the Central News Office at the Presidential Palace, Yedra, announced last night that the cabinet meeting heard a report from the Minister of the Interior about the normalization of the national situation. It was decided that a notification would be sent to the National Assembly today, explaining the reasons for the suspension of constitutional guarantees and the appropriateness of their restoration.

CARACAS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- According to local newspapers, the U.S. government is currently expediting the re-evaluation of the "Baker Plan" to seek a more practical solution to the debt problem.

The deteriorating situation in Latin America has caused strong concern in the Bush administration. Even in Venezuela, a country with a relatively stable democratic system, economic austerity measures have led to serious social unrest, making the U.S. authorities' consideration of re-evaluating the "Baker Plan" more urgent.

In the autumn of 1985, then-U.S. Secretary of the Treasury James Baker proposed a plan to address the international debt crisis. The plan called for international financial institutions and commercial banks to increase new loans to major debtor countries to support their economic adjustments. However, after the Baker Plan was proposed, international commercial banks responded coldly, and many debtor countries still faced difficulties in obtaining new loans.

U.S. President Bush had previously indicated that he would reconsider the "Baker Plan" after his election, but his actions have been slow since taking office. The recent social unrest in Venezuela has once again sounded the alarm for the United States.

　　委内瑞拉恢复宪法保障
    委社会动乱敲响警钟　美政府重审贝克计划
    本报加拉加斯３月９日电  记者朱满庭报道：委内瑞拉政府内阁在昨晚举行的会议上决定，从今天起恢复宪法对各项公民权利的保障。
    总统府中央新闻办公室主任耶德拉昨晚宣布，在昨天的内阁会议上，听取了内务部长关于全国局势已经正常的报告，决定于今天通告国会，说明取消宪法保障理由和恢复宪法保障已合时宜。
    本报加拉加斯３月９日电　记者朱满庭报道：据此间报纸报道，美国政府目前正加紧重新审查“贝克计划”，以便寻求一项解决债务问题的更加现实的办法。
    拉美国家形势的恶化已引起布什政府的强烈不安，在委内瑞拉这个民主政体较稳固的国家也因经济紧缩引起了严重的社会动乱使得美国当局重审“贝克计划”的考虑更加迫切。
    １９８５年秋，当时任美国财长的詹姆斯·贝克提出对付国际债务危机的计划，要求国际金融机构和商业银行增加对主要债务国的新贷款，支持这些国家调整经济。但是，贝克计划提出后，国际商业银行反应冷淡，广大债务国获得新贷款仍困难重重。
    美国总统布什在当选后曾表示要重新考虑“贝克计划”，但布什就职后却行动迟缓。委内瑞拉最近发生的社会骚乱给美国再次敲响了警钟。
