Title: Failure to Secure Planned Materials Leads to Halt in Yan Mountain Drip Irrigation Production

Yan Mountain drip irrigation equipment was jointly developed and produced by relevant departments in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, and the National Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower in 1985. It has the advantages of water-saving, energy-saving, and "increasing production and income," and is suitable for various terrains, soil types, and crops. Over the past five years, Yan Mountain drip irrigation equipment has covered over 90,000 acres of farmland, achieving good economic benefits and paving a new path for the development of drip irrigation technology in China.

At the 1986 International Drip Irrigation Conference, it was recognized that Yan Mountain drip irrigation equipment has reached the advanced level of similar products in the 1980s internationally. To better serve agricultural production with this new product, in 1985, the Hebei Provincial Economic Commission invested 100,000 yuan to renovate the machinery for producing drip irrigation equipment, significantly increasing the production capacity of drip irrigation equipment. In 1987, this product passed the national-level technical appraisal and was included in the national "Spark Program." For this reason, the Ministry of Water Resources and the Ministry of Light Industry allocated 504 tons of raw materials for the production of Yan Mountain drip irrigation equipment. However, relevant departments only supplied 15 tons last year, leaving a huge gap, causing the production of Yan Mountain drip irrigation equipment to be basically in a state of suspended production awaiting materials.

Due to the insufficient supply of raw materials, last year, Zunhua County only fulfilled 12.5 tons out of the 100 tons of drip irrigation equipment production contracts signed with some units. This year, more than 1,000 tons of production contracts can be signed, and foreign customers also demand orders. However, due to the lack of guaranteed raw materials, domestic and foreign contracts cannot be signed. This not only affects the production of Yan Mountain drip irrigation equipment but also hinders its entry into the international market. We hope that relevant departments at the national and provincial levels will work together to ensure the supply of raw materials and create conditions for the promotion of this achievement.

### 计划原料不落实  燕山滴灌已停产

　　计划原料不落实        
    燕山滴灌已停产
    燕山滴灌设备是１９８５年河北省遵化县有关部门与国家水利科学院联合研制生产的，具有节水、省能和“增产增收”的特点，适用于各种地形、各类土壤和多种农作物。５年来，燕山滴灌设备已覆盖９万多亩耕地，取得了较好的经济效益，为发展我国滴灌技术闯出了一条新路。
    １９８６年的国际滴灌会议上认定：燕山滴灌设备具有国际８０年代同类产品的先进水平。为使这一新产品能更好地为农业生产服务，１９８５年河北省计经委投资１０万元，改造了生产滴灌设备的机器，大大提高了滴灌设备的生产能力。１９８７年，这一产品通过了国家级技术鉴定，并被列入国家“星火计划”。为此，水电部、轻工部为燕山滴灌设备的生产单列了５０４吨的原材料计划。但是，去年有关部门只供应了１５吨，缺口太大，使燕山滴灌设备的生产基本处于停工待料的状态。
    由于原材料供应不足，去年遵化县与一些单位签订的滴灌设备生产合同１００吨，只兑现了１２．５吨。今年的生产合同可订出１０００多吨，国外客户也要求定货。但还是由于原材料无保证，国内外合同都不敢签。这不仅影响了燕山滴灌设备的生产，还影响了燕山滴灌设备打入国际市场。希望国家和省有关部门通力协作，落实原材料的供应，为这一成果推广创造条件。
