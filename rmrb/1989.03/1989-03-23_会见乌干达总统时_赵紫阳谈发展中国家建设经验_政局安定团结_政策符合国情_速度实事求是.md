During a meeting with Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, shared China's experiences in building a developing country. He emphasized three key points: maintaining a stable and united political situation, implementing policies that suit the country's conditions, and pursuing a realistic and gradual development speed.

Zhao Ziyang stated, "Based on China's experiences over the years, developing countries should remember three things when building their nations: First, the political situation must be stable, with a united and harmonious political environment; second, there should be practical, flexible, and country-specific social and economic policies; third, the development speed should be realistic and based on actual conditions, progressing step by step."

Zhao Ziyang mentioned that developing countries can take advantage of the easing international situation to address their domestic development issues and narrow the gap with developed countries. To seize this opportunity, it is essential to achieve domestic political stability, adopt policies suited to the country's conditions, and promote international cooperation.

He also noted that China, being a developing country itself, faces challenges such as cultural, educational, and technological backwardness, and a shortage of talent. Therefore, China is implementing an open-door policy to attract technology, talent, and management experience from abroad. He emphasized that developing countries should also engage in technological cooperation, as South-South cooperation should focus on technology sharing.

During the meeting, Zhao Ziyang praised Museveni's domestic policies and expressed hope for closer ties between the two countries.

Museveni briefed Zhao Ziyang on Uganda's political and economic situation.

　　会见乌干达总统时        
    赵紫阳谈发展中国家建设经验       
    政局安定团结　政策符合国情　速度实事求是
    本报北京３月２２日讯  记者孙毅报道：“根据中国多年来的经验，发展中国家要建设好自己的国家，应该记住三点：第一是政局要稳定，要有一个安定团结的政治局面；第二是要有一个务实的、灵活的、符合国情的社会政策和经济政策；第三，发展速度要实事求是，应该从实际出发，循序渐进。”这是中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天下午在中南海会见乌干达共和国总统约韦里·卡古塔·穆塞韦尼时说的一番话。
    赵紫阳说，发展中国家可以利用国际形势走向缓和这个有利的时机很好地解决自己国内的发展问题，以缩小同发达国家之间的差距。要不失掉这个时机，就需要我们实现国内的政局稳定，采取符合本国国情的政策，并且发展国际合作。
    赵紫阳说，中国也是一个发展中国家，文化、教育、科技落后，缺乏人才，所以我们现在实行对外开放政策，引进技术人才和管理经验。他说，发展中国家之间也应进行技术合作，南南合作的一个重要方面就是技术合作。
    会见时，赵紫阳还对穆塞韦尼总统在国内奉行的政策表示赞赏。希望双方来往更密切。
    穆塞韦尼总统向赵紫阳总书记介绍了乌干达国内的政治和经济情况。
