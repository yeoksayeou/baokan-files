In Beijing, Taiwanese Compatriots Call for Rectification of the "2·28" Uprising

	New China News Agency, Beijing, February 28th - Some Taiwanese compatriots in Beijing gathered this morning at the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (Taiwan Alliance) Central Hall to hold an academic seminar commemorating the 42nd anniversary of the "2·28" Uprising.

	The Chairman of the Taiwan Alliance Central Committee, Cai Zimin, briefly outlined the historical and ideological background of the "2·28" Uprising, refuting various falsehoods propagated by the Kuomintang (KMT) authorities about the uprising. He pointed out that the "2·28" Uprising was a struggle for democracy and self-governance by the people of Taiwan against the oppressive rule of the KMT. Only by correctly addressing the history of "2·28," upholding the democracy and justice of the Taiwanese people, and eliminating provincial barriers, can the future be opened up, and Taiwan society develop healthily.

	Lin Liyun, President of the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, said in her speech that the "2·28" Uprising was an uprising by the people of Taiwan to fight for democratic rights and to seek a decent living. It was not, as the KMT maliciously distorted, about "Taiwan independence" or "separatism." Some of the survivors of the "2·28" Uprising of that year came to mainland China, and over the past 40-plus years, they have made significant contributions to the construction of mainland China.

	She said that over the past 40-plus years, the people of Taiwan have demanded that the Taiwan authorities face history, reveal the truth about "2·28," commemorate the martyrs, and apologize to the survivors and the families of the martyrs. However, to this day, there has been no response from the Taiwan authorities, and they have even made some unreasonable statements, which has caused resentment among the people of Taiwan. We once again hope that the Taiwan authorities will respect the will of the Taiwanese people for peace, democracy, and freedom, and rectify the history of "2·28," so that the wounds of the Taiwanese people can heal as soon as possible.

	Lin Liyun pointed out that on the occasion of the 42nd anniversary of the "2·28" Uprising, we advise the Taiwan authorities to learn from history, follow the trend of national reunification, respect the will of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, further open up exchanges between the two sides, and make a wise choice for the early reunification of the motherland.

	Wu Ketao, Jiang Nong, Ye Jidong, Xu Mengshan, and others spoke at the seminar.

　　在京台胞举行座谈时呼吁
    台当局应为“２·２８”起义平反
    新华社北京２月２８日电  部分在京台籍人士今天上午在台盟中央礼堂聚会，举行纪念“二·二八”起义４２周年学术座谈会。
    台盟中央主席团主席蔡子民简述了“二·二八”起义的历史和思想背景，驳斥了国民党当局对“二·二八”起义的种种不实之词。他指出，“二·二八”起义是台湾人民反对国民党苛政、要求民主自治的全岛性斗争。只有正确对待“二·二八”的历史，伸张台湾人民的民主与正义，消除省籍隔阂，才能开辟未来，使台湾社会健康地发展。
    全国台联会会长林丽韫在发言中说，“二·二八”起义是台湾人民为争取民主权利，求得温饱的起义，是台湾人民正义的反抗。并不是国民党肆意歪曲宣传的那样是什么“台独”、“分离”等等。当年“二·二八”起义的部分幸存者来到祖国大陆，４０多年来为祖国大陆的建设做出了重大贡献。
    她说，４０多年来，台湾人民要求台湾当局面对历史，公布“二·二八”真相，祭奠死难者，并向事件幸存者及死难者家属道歉。但时至今日，未见台湾当局有任何表示，而且还发表一些不合情理的讲话，从而引起台湾人民的反感。我们再次希望台湾当局尊重台湾人民要求和平、民主自由的意愿，对“二·二八”这段历史给予平反，使台湾人民４０多年的伤痕早日愈合。
    林丽韫指出，在纪念“二·二八”起义４２周年之际，我们奉劝台湾当局吸取历史教训，顺应祖国统一的时代潮流，尊重海峡两岸的民意，进一步开放两岸交流，为祖国早日统一做出明智的抉择。
    吴克泰、江浓、叶纪东、徐萌山等先后在座谈会上发了言。
