The first batch of Chinese players participating in the 40th World Table Tennis Championships arrived in Dortmund, the host city, and immediately began intense pre-competition adaptation training.

Head coach Xu Shao Fa told reporters: The team members are in high spirits, training normally, and in good physical condition. Most of the team members have already adjusted to the time difference.

The team members Jiang Jialiang, Chen Longcan, Teng Yi, Ma Wenge, Yu Shentong, Chen Jing, Li Huifen, Hu Xiaoxin, Chen Zihe, as well as Wei Qingguang, Chen Zhibin, Lin Zhigang, Liu Wei, Ding Yaping, and 14 other team members arrived here on the afternoon of the 22nd after more than 20 hours of travel. The next day, they began training.

On the 24th, it was Easter, and local residents had a four-day holiday. Offices were closed, shops were not open, and even the usually busy streets were quiet. But the Chinese table tennis players had no thoughts of celebrating. They focused on their training. At around 9 o'clock in the morning, they went to the Abteilon Club. This club has been established for exactly 40 years and has trained many table tennis players. Our national table tennis star Liang Ge Liang played here from 1983 to 1986. When they heard that the Chinese team was coming to practice, club director Mr. Biti came to the club early to make personal arrangements. Many of the club's fans also gave up the opportunity to be with their families and came to watch.

During the nearly two-hour training session, the team members were excited. Under the guidance of the coaches, they practiced both techniques and physical fitness, each working hard and meticulously. Biti, who has been playing table tennis for over 30 years, got itchy hands and challenged Ding Yaping in a friendly match. He played with skill and precision, showing deep foundations. After the training, Biti, on behalf of the club, presented Xu Shao Fa with a pickaxe-shaped cane with a miner's emblem and wished the Chinese table tennis team smooth sailing and success in this competition.

After lunch and a short rest, the Chinese table tennis players appeared again in the training hall of the Westfalen Stadium, the venue for this World Table Tennis Championships. Unexpectedly, the fans from the Abteilon Club were already waiting there. Xu Shao Fa humorously said, "The Chinese table tennis team already has its first cheerleading squad."

The Chinese table tennis team was the first foreign team to arrive at the venue. Since there are still a few days until the reception for the event, they are temporarily staying in a small, somewhat poor hotel. Three or four people share a small room without a bathroom. They eat Chinese food, which, though not abundant, is to their taste. "Is the accommodation and food a bit poor?" Li Huifen's answer was straightforward, "We don't mind if the accommodation and food are a bit poor. The important thing is to train hard and play well in the competition."

Deputy head coach Zhang Xiaolin revealed this information to the reporter: The team members train very hard, but the problem is that there is still some time before the competition. We coaches need to control the training volume, train techniques, and also maintain physical strength, and try to avoid the team's competitive state peaking too early.

　　厉兵秣马迎大战
    参加第四十届世界乒乓球锦标赛的中国队首批球员到达赛地多特蒙德之后，即投入了紧张的赛前适应性训练。
    总教练许绍发告诉记者：队员们精神饱满，训练正常，身体状况良好，大多数队员已过时差关。
    男女团体赛队员江嘉良、陈龙灿、滕毅、马文革、于沈潼、陈静、李惠芬、胡小新、陈子荷，以及韦晴光、陈志斌、林志刚、刘伟、丁亚萍等１４名队员是经过２０多小时的颠簸劳顿后，于２２日下午抵达这里的。第二天，他们便开始了训练。
    ２４日是复活节，当地市民放假四天，机关不办公，商店不营业，连往日汽车穿梭不息的街道也显得十分冷清。但中国乒乓健儿们没有过节的心思，一心扑在“球”上。上午９点来钟，他们又来到了阿布泰隆俱乐部。这个俱乐部已成立整整４０年，曾培养了不少乒乓好手。我国乒坛名将梁戈亮１９８３年—１９８６年间曾在这里打过球。听说中国队要来练球，俱乐部主任比蒂先生便早早来到俱乐部，亲自张罗安排，俱乐部的不少球迷也放弃与家人团聚的机会，赶来观看。
    在两个来小时的训练中，队员们显得兴奋，在教练的指导下，既练技术，又练身体素质，个个认真卖力，一丝不苟。已打了３０多年乒乓球的比蒂手痒了，拿起球拍与削球手丁亚萍比试一番。他打得有板有眼，一招一式都显示出深厚的功底。训练结束后，比蒂代表俱乐部向许绍发赠送了装有矿工标志的鎯头式手杖，并祝愿中国乒乓球队在本届比赛中能够一帆风顺取得成功。
    用过午餐，稍事休息后，中国乒乓健儿又出现在本届世乒赛赛场威斯特法伦体育馆训练馆里。想不到阿布泰隆俱乐部的球迷们早已等候在那里了。许绍发风趣地说：“中国乒乓球队已经有了第一支啦啦队。”
    中国乒乓球队是第一支到达赛地的外国球队，由于离大会接待的时间还有几天，他们暂住在一家条件比较差的小旅馆里，三四个人住一间没有盥洗室的小房。吃的是中国餐，虽不丰盛，倒还合口味。“这样的膳宿条件是否差了些？”李惠芬的回答很直率，“膳宿条件差点儿不在乎，重要的是要抓紧训练，才能打好比赛。”
    副总教练张燮林向笔者透露了这样的信息：队员们练起来都很刻苦，问题是离比赛还有一段时间，我们教练要掌握训练量，要练技术，也要保持体力，尽量避免队员竞技状态的高潮过早出现。
