At the education-themed press conference held on the 24th by the National People's Congress, reporters from various outlets eagerly raised their hands to ask questions, creating a forest of arms.

Mr. Tan Zhigang from the Taiwan China Times wore a snowy white jacket; Miss Lin Cuifen from the Hong Kong Ming Pao wore a floral top, and they also had the opportunity to speak. A female reporter who did not get a chance to speak, dressed in a black coat, regretted, "If I had known this, I would have worn a bright-colored dress."

    在２４日人大召开的教育专题记者招待会上，各路记者争先恐后提问，手臂像森林般举起，衣着鲜艳者沾了光。本报记者李泓冰穿一件大红外套，格外醒目，一下子被会议召集人点了“将”。台湾中国时报的谭志强先生身着雪白的夹克衫；香港明报的林翠芬小姐穿一件花背心，他们也有幸发了言。一位没有得到发言机会、身着黑大衣的女记者不无遗憾地说，早知道如此，我不如穿一套亮色的裙子来。
