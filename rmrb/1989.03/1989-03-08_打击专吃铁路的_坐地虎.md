Since last May, incidents of theft and illegal acquisition of railway equipment have frequently occurred on the Lanzhou-Wuwei section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the Lanzhou-Chengdu section of the Baolan Railway, both under the jurisdiction of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau. Although our bureau has taken some measures, the results have been minimal.

On the early morning of December 7 last year, the Lanzhou Railway Public Security Bureau apprehended two individuals, Ren Liuzhi and Liang Ziying, who were selling stolen railway equipment at the Lanzhou West Station Agricultural Machinery Factory. The bureau also seized over three tons of railway equipment that the factory had illegally acquired over five days. During the investigation, another accomplice, Ren Ping, was arrested, and 91 new railway frogs were recovered. On December 9, the track maintenance worker Lü Fengcheng discovered that 18 fishplate tails had been stolen from a railway bridge on the Baolan line, and another set of fishplate tail bolts had been removed. Fortunately, the track maintenance worker discovered this in time, preventing a potential derailment. The investigation revealed that these materials had been sold to scrap metal collectors by the thieves.

It is hoped that relevant departments will take measures to severely crack down on those who prey on the railway, thereby ensuring the safety of train operations.

### 打击专吃铁路的“坐地虎”

　　打击专吃铁路的“坐地虎”
    去年５月以来，在兰州铁路局管辖的兰新铁路兰（州）武（威）段和包兰铁路兰（州）银（川）段，大肆盗卖和非法收购铁路器材的事件时有发生。我局虽采取了一些措施，但收效甚微。
    去年１２月７日凌晨，兰州铁路公安分局将正在兰州西站农机厂销赃的任六志、梁自英２人当场抓获，并查获了这家工厂连续５天非法收购的铁路器材３吨多。追赃过程中，又抓获了他们的同伙任平，追回火车新闸瓦９１块。１２月９日，分守岭养路工区巡道工吕风成在包兰线巡道时，发现一座铁桥护轮轨的鱼尾板被拆盗１８块，另一组鱼尾板螺栓被拆掉。幸亏巡道工发现及时，才避免了一起可能导致列车颠覆的事故。经调查，这些器材已被盗窃者卖给收废铁的人。
    希望有关部门采取措施，狠狠打击那些专吃铁路的“坐地虎”，以保证行车安全。
