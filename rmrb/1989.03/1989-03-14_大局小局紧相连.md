Title: The Big Picture and the Small Picture Are Interconnected

From last winter, the entire country has been facing an energy crisis: some thermal power plants have been forced to shut down, some large steel mills are anxious because they only have enough coal for a few days, some fertilizer enterprises are short of coal and electricity and have stopped production, and some small and medium-sized enterprises, including township enterprises, are also facing difficulties...

People are puzzled, how did the situation become so tense so quickly? Answering this question is not so simple. Some say that the main reason is that the policy of favoring certain sectors is not being implemented, leading to lagging energy production; others say that the rapid development of processing industries has caused a severe imbalance in energy supply and demand. This, of course, makes sense. Some people also point out that regional fragmentation, where each area looks after its own interests, is one of the main reasons for the worsening energy crisis.

Those who propose the latter view have evidence to support it: fertilizer production is a key industry for supporting agriculture, which is the big picture, but fertilizer enterprises are major energy consumers. Moreover, the fertilizers produced may not all be used locally. Cutting the electricity and coal supply to a fertilizer enterprise can ensure the production of a large number of processing enterprises. When local authorities do the math, they can't afford to worry about the "big picture," so fertilizer enterprises frequently face emergencies, to the point where the central government has to issue an urgent notice to ease the situation; moreover, the manager of a large steel plant told the author that because of the lack of electricity, they had to shut down nine out of ten steel furnaces this year. This plant produces special steel, with an electricity consumption of 550 kilowatt-hours per ton, but it has to stop production, while those small steel furnaces set up by local governments, with an electricity consumption of over 700 kilowatt-hours per ton, continue to operate because they are the "treasures" of the local area.

Therefore, the energy crisis is due, on the one hand, to insufficient investment in energy production and slow results, and on the other hand, to the pursuit of local interests, which leads some places to focus on small issues rather than the big picture. This involves both systemic problems, with rigid barriers between sectors, blocks, and regions; and issues of unfair distribution of benefits, where having something is better than not having anything. Thus, redundant construction occurs, with some having heads but no bodies or tails, some having bodies but no heads or tails, and even those with nothing starting up, engaging in large and small battles to seize energy and raw materials. As a result, what could have been maintained smoothly cannot be maintained, and what was already tense becomes even more so. Add to this the chaos caused by official and private speculators, and things become even more chaotic!

This raises the question that in terms of economic development strategy, a holistic approach is necessary. While developing production in various places, one must consider the characteristics of each place, but should also adjust the industrial structure, enterprise structure, and product structure of the locality according to the state's industrial policies. One cannot turn a large chessboard into many self-enclosed small chessboards, where the pieces in the small chessboard move easily, but the pieces on the large chessboard cannot move, and the big picture becomes an empty phrase! Modern production is socialized production, and difficulties in the big picture will inevitably bring difficulties to each part. Of course, to solve this problem, it is important to clarify industrial policies at the macro level and formulate corresponding measures; it is equally important for each place and each part to have a holistic approach, otherwise, macro decisions will be difficult to implement.

　　大局小局紧相连
    江畅
    从去年冬季以来，全国上下能源紧张：一些火电厂被迫停机，一些大钢铁厂因只有几天用的煤而着急，一些化肥企业缺煤缺电断了“炊”，一些中小企业，包括乡镇企业也遇到了困难……
    人们困惑，何以一下子就紧张到这种程度？回答这个问题当然不那么简单。有人说，主要是倾斜政策不倾斜，能源生产滞后；有人说，加工工业发展太快，能源供需严重失衡。这，当然有道理。还有人提出，地方割据，各顾各，也是加剧能源紧张的主要原因之一。
    提出后一个观点的，有例为证：化肥生产是支农工业的重点，是大局，但化肥企业是耗能大户，况且生产出来的化肥也并不一定都用在当地，砍掉一个化肥企业的用电用煤，可以保一大片加工企业的生产。地方上一算这个账，也就顾不得这个“大局”了，于是一时间，化肥企业频频告急，直弄到中央下紧急通知才缓过这口气；还有，一个大型钢厂的厂长向笔者诉说，因为没电，他们今年十台炼钢炉停了九台。这个厂是生产特种钢的，吨钢耗电５５０千瓦·时，却被迫停产，而那些地方办的小炼钢炉，吨钢耗电多达７００多千瓦·时，也照样生产，因为那是地方上的“宝贝疙瘩”。
    所以，能源的紧张，一方面是能源生产投入不足，见效也慢，另一方面各自的利益关系，促使一些地方顾小局而不顾大局。这里既有体制上的毛病，条条之间、条块之间、块块之间，壁垒森严；又有利益分配不公的问题，你有毕竟不如我有。于是重复建设，有头的安身子、尾巴，有身子的安头安尾巴，甚至什么都没有的都上，展开了一场场大大小小争夺能源和原材料的战斗。这样一来，本来可以平稳维持的，维持不住了；有些紧张的就急剧紧张。再加上官倒、私倒推波助澜，乘机作祟，岂不就乱了套！
    这里就提出了一个问题，在经济发展的战略上，必须有一个全局思想。各地发展生产，固然要考虑各地的特点，但应依照国家的产业政策，调整本地的产业结构、企业结构和产品结构。不能搞成一个大棋盘上划许多自我封闭的小棋盘，小棋盘里的子好走，大棋盘上的子却走不开了，大局也就成了一句空话！现代化生产是社会化的生产，大局上的困难，又势必给每个局部带来困难。当然，要解决这个问题，宏观上进一步明确产业政策，并制订相应的措施非常重要；而各个地方各个局部树立全局思想也是同样重要的，不然宏观决策也难以落实。
