Yugoslavia Investigates Organizers of Albanian Strike

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) — The Internal Affairs Department of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo in Yugoslavia issued a statement today. Three individuals—Albanian member of the Kosovo Provincial Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, A. Vlasic, Chairman of the "Trepca" United Labor Organization Business Committee, A. Abrasihaj, and the manager of the "Stari Trg" mine (where the Albanian strike took place), B. Kavaja—have been summoned by the provincial Internal Affairs Department.

The statement said that the available evidence confirms that the activities of Vlasic and the other two individuals are linked to the events of 1988 and 1989, constituting criminal cases. They will be handed over to the judicial authorities for further investigation after being summoned.

Vlasic previously held the positions of Central Committee member of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and member of the Provincial Committee of the League of Communists of Kosovo. After being removed from his position as a member of the Provincial Committee of the League of Communists of Kosovo in November 1988, 100,000 Albanians protested in the capital of Kosovo. After being removed from his position as a Central Committee member of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in early February this year, Albanian workers at the "Stari Trg" mine initiated the strike, leading to strikes and protests in more than 10 cities in Kosovo. One of the demands of the recent general strike by Albanians was the restoration of Vlasic's position.

　　南追究阿族人罢工组织者
    科索沃前领导人受审
    本报贝尔格莱德３月２日电  记者严正报道：南斯拉夫科索沃自治省内务部今天发表公报，科索沃共盟省委委员阿·弗拉西、“特雷普查”联合劳动组织业务委员会主席阿·阿布拉希伊和“斯塔尔特尔格”矿（阿族人罢工所在矿区）经理布·卡瓦亚被省内务部传讯。
    公报说，已经掌握的材料证实，弗拉西等３人的活动与１９８８年和１９８９年的事件有关系，已构成了刑事犯罪案件。他们被传讯后将交司法机关进一步审理。
    弗拉西曾任南共联盟中央委员和共盟省委主席团成员之职。１９８８年１１月他被解除共盟省委主席团成员的职务后，科索沃首府曾发生过１０万阿族人的抗议示威；今年２月初他被解除南共中央委员的职务后，由“斯塔尔特尔格”矿阿族工人首先发难，在科索沃爆发了１０多个城市的阿族人罢工和抗议活动。最近这次阿族人总罢工的要求之一，就是恢复弗拉西的职务。
