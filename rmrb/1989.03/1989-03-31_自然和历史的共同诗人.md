Sha Qing, currently a graduate student at the Lu Xun Literary Institute, is a journalist. Originally, he wanted to express his concern and exploration of people and society through news reports. However, this desire was unknowingly influenced by various factors and became a curve, failing to achieve his original goal of directly penetrating the essence of things and the human soul. In 1985, Sha Qing wrote "Beijing Loses Balance," fully realizing this point. This piece of reportage literature depicts Beijing, which is troubled by the water resources crisis. Some in the literary circle evaluate it as the first attempt by reportage literature writers to build ecological awareness in the hearts of Chinese people in recent years. In a series of subsequent reportage literature, Sha Qing wanted to represent the city—the essence of human civilization—in a desperate search for a new point of harmonious coexistence with nature. He strenuously guides people to calm the nature's intolerable revenge against human plundering.

The unceasing pursuit made Sha Qing's soul and style almost break through some old frameworks overnight. He resolutely abandoned his previous writing style, which was praised by many, and the enviable career of a "famous journalist." He strictly examined himself, saying, "Before 'Beijing Loses Balance' was published, what I wrote as reportage literature was actually the result of subconscious compliance, a mixture of character news, reportage literature, and biography." The "rebirth" made Sha Qing's gaze as clear as the infusion of spirituality. When he looked at the western region again (in the early 1980s, he went to the western region to track giant pandas and wrote a series of news reports that were popular among both the elite and the masses), he, like a melancholy historian, placed the present Loess Plateau under the five-thousand-year sky, letting readers watch it gradually disappear in the clouds with him. This is his reportage literature "Dimly, the Great Earth Bay," a work where human history and nature are closely combined. Nature and ecology have always been the themes that Sha Qing closely pursues. However, once the inspiration about people and society floats in front of his eyes, he will follow it into the secular world. "Dimly, the Great Earth Bay" and his ongoing work "Cultural Games" are such "turning point" works. The latter is a view from a high place of our nation's contemporary spiritual journey. Because of the high vantage point, all our actions seem to have a touch of both comic and tragic colors. The article does not have a clear conclusion, but in the "game" intervals, Sha Qing's anxious eyes can be seen from time to time.

In his writing practice, Sha Qing tries to make each of his works different, saying that this is an attempt to delay aging, as a person cannot repeat himself too many times. The greatest surprise Sha Qing gives people is the difference in his reportage literature style: "Majestic Capital" is like a middle-aged man from a familiar village writing it, while the author of "Dimly, the Great Earth Bay" is like an emotionally intense and fluent essayist, and "Heat Island" should be written by a young experimental novelist... When he was in charge of the "New Star Concert" back then, he was considered too young, but now, he has entered the literary world with a mature soul.

　　自然和历史的共同诗人
    现在鲁迅文学院读研究生的沙青是一位记者，本来，他想通过新闻表现自己对人和社会的关注探索。当然这种愿望在不知不觉中受到各种因素的影响而成为曲线，没有达到如他原来所想的直锲事物本质和人类心灵的目的。沙青在１９８５年写《北京失去平衡》时彻底认识到了这一点。这篇报告文学写的是因水资源危机而苦恼着的北京，文学界有人评价说它是近年来报告文学家企图在中国人心中构建生态意识的第一次尝试。在以后一系列的报告文学中，沙青想代表城市——人类文明的凝缩，在苦苦寻找一个新的与自然和谐相处的点，他费力地劝导人们去平复自然界对人类蹂躏的忍无可忍的报复。
    不息地追求使沙青的心灵和文体几乎是在一夜间冲破了一些旧有的框框。他毅然抛弃了被许多人叫好的过去的写法和令人羡慕的“名记者”生涯。他严格审视自己说，《北京失去平衡》发表以前我所写的所谓报告文学实际是下意识迎合的结果，是人物通讯、报告文学和传记的混合体。“涅槃般的重生”使沙青的目光清澈得有如溶进灵性，再看西部时（８０年代初他曾去西部追踪大熊猫，写了一系列雅俗共赏的新闻报道。）像忧郁的史学家一样把现在的黄土高原放到了五千年的天幕上，让读者和他一起看着它在云霞中一点点隐没，这就是他的报告文学《依稀大地湾》，一部人的历史和自然结合得很紧的作品。自然、生态一向是沙青紧紧追寻的题材，可一旦关于人和社会的灵感飘过眼前，他会紧跟着走入世俗中的。《依稀大地湾》和他正在写的《文化游戏》就是这样的“转念”之作。后者是站在高处看我们民族当代的精神历程，正因为站在高处，因而我们所有人的举动都显得有些喜剧色彩和悲凉。文章没有明确的结论，只是在“游戏”的间隙中时时可见沙青焦灼的双目。
    在写作实践中，沙青尽量使自己的作品篇篇不同，他说这是企图延缓衰老，一个人对自我重复不了多少次。沙青给人最大的惊奇就是其报告文学风格的差异：《皇皇都城》像一个熟悉乡里的中年汉子写的，而《依稀大地湾》的作者则像是一位感情强烈流畅的美文家，《热岛》则应该是一位青年实验小说家写的……当年操办《新星音乐会》时他曾被认为太嫩，如今，他却以成熟的心灵走进了文学的天地。
