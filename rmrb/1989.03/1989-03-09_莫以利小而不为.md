Title: Do Not Disdain Small Profits

Recently, a colleague wanted to buy lighter flints and headed straight for the Ningbo Yaguang Small Commodities Store. However, the long sign was gone, and the store name had changed to "Gulou Market." The goods had also changed from the original small items priced at twenty yuan or less to high-end items like pressure cookers, gas cylinders, and refrigerators. He went with high hopes but returned disappointed.

Whether a business can make money does not entirely depend on the price of the goods. Wenzhou Qiaotou Town became famous by producing and selling buttons; Beijing's unemployed youth started with large bowl tea and quickly became a company with a business volume of several hundred million yuan... This shows that low-priced, small-profit goods, due to their wide consumer base, can turn small businesses into big deals. On the other hand, focusing only on high-end goods might end up in a loss. Business operators should think carefully about this.

　　莫以利小而不为
    黄明朗
    最近，一位同事想买打火机电石，径直奔向宁波耀光小商品商店，可是那串长长的招牌不见了，店名已改为“鼓楼商场”，商品也从原来二十元以下的小商品变为高压锅、煤气瓶、冰箱之类的高档货。他乘兴而去，扫兴而归。
    做生意能否赚钱，并不完全取决于商品价钱大小。温州桥头镇靠生产、销售纽扣成了大气候；北京待业青年靠大碗茶起家，一跃成为营业额几千万元的大公司……这说明，价低利微的商品，由于消费者众多，是可以使小生意变成大买卖的。相反，眼睛只盯着高档货，搞不好，也可能赔本。愿经营者慎思之。
