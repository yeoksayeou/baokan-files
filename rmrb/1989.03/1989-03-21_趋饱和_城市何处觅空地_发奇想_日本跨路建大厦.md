Japan's Cabinet on the 17th approved amendments to four urban development laws, including the Road Law. According to the amendments, Japanese cities will promote the integrated development of roads and buildings to fully utilize the space above and below highways.

Japanese major cities are nearing land saturation. The business community, eager for development, sees this situation as a hindrance to various industries. They are looking for every possible space and have already set their sights on the space above and below highways.

According to the cabinet-approved amendments, the right to use the space above and below roads will change from being solely owned by road managers to being shared by road managers and surrounding landowners. Under the condition of ensuring traffic safety and smooth flow, it will be possible to build high-rise buildings across roads.

Although this amendment still needs to be approved by the Diet, the impatient Japanese construction industry has already begun planning. The Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway Public Corporation is preparing to build a ten-story building across the highway in Hakusaki. The Japan Road Public Corporation, currently constructing the Tokyo Outer Ring Road, is also planning to collaborate with the Saitama Prefecture and Mitaka City housing company to build high-rise residential buildings across the road while constructing it, aiming to sell and profit from it. These plans are scheduled to be implemented within the year.

In a few years, such cross-road skyscrapers may become another unique landscape on the Japanese archipelago.

　　趋饱和　城市何处觅空地        
    发奇想　日本跨路建大厦
    本报讯  日本内阁１７日通过了道路法等４项有关城建法律的修正案。根据修正案，日本城市今后将推进道路与房屋的总体开发，以充分利用高速公路的上下空间。
    日本大城市土地利用已近饱和。锐意发展的经济界认为，这种状况阻碍着各项事业的发展。他们见缝就想插针，早就打起了高速公路上下空间的主意。
    根据内阁通过的修正案，道路上下空间的使用权将由道路管理者独有变为道路管理者与周围土地所有者共有。在保证行车安全、通畅的情况下，可横跨道路修建高楼大厦。
    虽然这项修正案还有待国会批准，但性急的日本建筑业界已开始进行筹划。首都高速公路公团准备在箱崎横跨高速公路建一座十层大楼。日本道路公团目前正承建东京外环路。他们也准备和道路所经过的埼玉县和光市住宅公司合作，在筑路的同时，建起跨路高层住宅，出卖牟利。这些计划都打算在年内付诸实施。
    再过几年，这种跨路大厦也许会成为日本列岛的又一奇特景观。
