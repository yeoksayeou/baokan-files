The credit scale of Hebei Province, which had been a source of concern last August, has now been effectively controlled.

The various levels of banks in Hebei have actively pursued the collection of loans. During the comprehensive inspection of credit and cash management, the various levels of government uncovered more than 10 issues involving violations of credit and cash management, with a total amount of 4.26 billion yuan. While resolutely curbing over-scale loans, the entire province has recovered overdue loans and other unreasonable loans totaling 1.8 billion yuan, significantly easing the tension in the supply and demand of funds.

　　清收贷款　严肃纪律
    河北有效控制信贷规模
    本报石家庄３月５日电  记者杨振武、陈国琦报道：去年８月还令人担忧的河北省信贷规模，如今得到有效控制。
    河北各级银行积极催收贷款。各级政府在信贷现金大检查中，查出１０多个违反信贷现金管理的问题，涉及金额４２．６亿元。全省在坚决压缩超规模贷款的同时，收回逾期贷款和其它不合理贷款１８亿元，大大缓和了资金供求矛盾。
