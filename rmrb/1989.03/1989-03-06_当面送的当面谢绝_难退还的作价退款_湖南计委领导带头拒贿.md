	Leaders of the Hunan Provincial Planning Commission lead by example in refusing bribes, maintaining integrity, and winning praise from grassroots groups.

	The Hunan Provincial Planning Commission has the authority over certain personnel, financial, and material resources in the province. Over a period of time, some units or individuals, in order to solve certain problems through the commission, would send gifts or money when handling matters. The leaders of the Hunan Provincial Planning Commission firmly resist this improper practice. They refuse gifts on the spot, persuade and decline them; if gifts are discovered later, they return them through the organization; if they cannot be returned, they compensate for the value. According to incomplete statistics, the six members of the commission's party group have returned gifts and cash a total of 41 times, with a total value of over 6,600 yuan.

	In November of last year, a certain city's cement factory wanted the provincial planning commission to reduce the factory's mandatory plan. The factory director placed cash in an envelope and sent it to the home of the party secretary and director of the provincial planning commission, Wang Xiaofeng, who refused it. Later, the factory director had a classmate bring a fur coat worth 863 yuan to Wang's home, leaving it unnoticed by Wang's family. Upon returning from an out-of-town trip, Wang learned of the incident and immediately handed the fur coat over to the provincial planning commission's party group, writing a letter to the organizational party committee. The letter stated: "Please return this item. Strengthen the propaganda and education of the factory leaders. It is truly heartbreaking to see public funds being spent like this! To govern cleanly, one must not only set an example but also need the support of enterprises and the masses."

　　当面送的当面谢绝　难退还的作价退款
    湖南计委领导带头拒贿
    本报长沙３月５日电  记者吴兴华报道：湖南省计委领导成员在经济活动中带头拒礼拒贿，保持廉洁，受到基层群众的称赞。
    省计委掌握全省一定的人、财、物权。一段时间以来，有的单位或个人为了从该委解决某些难题，办事时便送物、送钱。对这种不正之风，湖南省计委的领导成员坚决予以抵制。他们做到当面送的，当面说服谢绝；事后发现送的，通过组织退还；难以退的，作价退款。据不完全统计，计委党组６名成员，先后退回礼物、现金４１人次，礼物折款和现金共６６００多元。
    去年１１月，某市水泥厂为了要省计委核减该厂指令性计划，派厂负责人将钞票放在信封内，送到省计委党组书记、主任汪啸风家里，遭到拒绝。后来，这个厂的负责人又托同学拿了一件价值８６３元的裘皮女式大衣到汪家，乘其家属不注意，丢下就走了。汪啸风从外地回来后，得知这件事，马上将裘皮大衣交到省计委党组，并给机关党委写了一封信。信中说：“请将此物退回。要加强对厂领导宣传教育。公家的钱这样花，真痛心啊！为政清廉，除了自己以身作则外，还需要企业和群众支持。”
