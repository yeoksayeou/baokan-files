	The Cultural Significance of Product Imagery
		– Reflections on Technical Aesthetics

	The boundaries between technology and art have long been a subject of debate. In ancient times, technology was based on production experience and intuitive perception, with a focus on the study of proportions and scales as the core of its improvement. Art, as the creation of beauty, also requires certain skills as a prerequisite. In both handicraft production and artistic creation, the products embody human spiritual individuality, thus becoming expressions of human will, ideas, and emotions. In the modern industrial age, technology and art have undergone qualitative differentiation, with technology combining with science to produce technical science and engineering technology. However, technology and art still have innumerable connections.

	If one seeks to differentiate between technology and art, one should start with their purposes. The purpose of technology is to create products with practical functions, while the purpose of art is to express and reflect human social life through the creation of artistic images. This results in a qualitative difference between products and artworks in their external forms. However, people always hope to integrate aesthetic activities into material production, making everyday items pleasing to the eye. Therefore, some methods of image creation are also applied to material products. However, this pursuit of artistry is not always successful; sometimes it produces the opposite effect.

	Recently, I saw a traveler carrying a bag and holding a delicate large cake box, inside which was a figure of an elderly person made of cake. Obviously, the traveler was bringing birthday wishes to an elderly person far away. However, when the family members eat this birthday cake, the figure symbolizing the elderly person's longevity will be "tortured" by the knife and fork. What kind of psychological reaction will the elderly person have? This phenomenon also exists in daily items. There is a type of plastic glue bottle designed in the shape of a woman, with the woman's head as the bottle cap. When you open the bottle cap to use the glue, you have to twist off the woman's head. What a cruel design concept!

	Garbage bins shaped like precious animals once became popular, but they were criticized because the product's image did not match its function, going against people's good feelings of protecting rare birds and the ecological environment. Therefore, it not only failed to create an interesting environment but also clashed with the modern lifestyle of tall buildings and busy traffic.

	In the history of modern industrial design, there have been different choices for product imagery. The development of aerodynamics once made streamlined shapes fashionable. The famous industrial designer Levy once designed a refrigerator with a rounded top, which drew criticism. Housewives complained that even an egg could not be placed on top of the refrigerator, making it very inconvenient. Later, the design of refrigerators changed to a flat-box shape, which better met practical needs. Initially, streamlined cars had an appearance like a beetle, giving people an unpleasant association. People felt that this car, like a beetle, would only crawl slowly and clumsily. However, the current boat-shaped and wedge-shaped car designs avoid this negative association, giving people a sense of dignity and brightness.

	In summary, the shapes of industrial products and the creation of artistic images have fundamental differences. Artistic images often mimic social life images, while product images are the sensory presentation of their own functions. The beauty of product images lies in the orderliness and purposefulness unique to their functional structures. The structure of a product and its external form do not have a one-to-one correspondence, thus leaving ample room for people to engage in aesthetic creation of product forms. Excellent designers are good at utilizing the inherent beauty of product materials and structures, adapting to different psychological needs of people, and creating product images with distinctive features of the times.

### 产品形象的文化意味——技术美学随感

　　产品形象的文化意味        
    ——技术美学随感
    技艺相通，因此对于技术和艺术的分野历来颇有争议。在古代的手工业生产中，技术是建立在生产经验和直观感受的基础上，对于比例和尺度的钻研成了它赖以改进的核心；而艺术作为美的创造也必须以一定的技巧为前提。在手工业生产和艺术生产中都物化了人的精神个性，因此它们的产物都成为人的意志、观念和情感的表达。在当今的工业化时代，技术和艺术有了质的分化，技术与科学的结合产生了技术科学和工程技术。但是，技术和艺术之间仍然具有千丝万缕的联系。
    如果要寻找技术和艺术的区别，那么首先应该从它们的目的性出发。技术的目的在创造具有实用功能的产品，而艺术的目的在于通过艺术形象的塑造表现和反映人的社会生活。这就使产品和艺术品之间在外部形态上有了质的不同。然而，人们总是希望把审美活动融合到物质生产中，使日常生活的用品具有令人赏心悦目的外观。因此，也把某些形象塑造的手段用于物质产品。但是，在这种艺术性的追求中，并非都是成功的，有些甚至事与愿违，产生出完全相反的效果。
    笔者近日看到一位旅客背负行囊，手里提着一个精致的大蛋糕盒，盒里是一尊用奶油蛋糕做成的寿星老。显然，这位旅客是为远方的老人带去生日的祝贺。但是，当全家人分食这个生日蛋糕的时候，这个象征老人长寿的寿星老将被刀叉所“凌迟”。那么老人又会产生怎样的心理感受呢？在日常用品中也有这种现象。有一种塑料的胶水瓶被做成了一个仕女的形象，而仕女的头就是瓶盖。当你打开瓶盖使用胶水时，就得拧下仕女的头。这又是一种多么残酷的设计构思啊！
    借用珍贵动物的形象做成的垃圾桶曾经风靡一时，它所以遭到许多非议，正是由于产品的形象与它的功能很不协调，有悖于人们保护珍禽异兽和生态环境的美好情感。因此，它不仅未能创造出富于情趣的环境，反而与楼房林立、交通繁忙的现代生活情调格格不入。
    在现代工业设计的历史上，也出现过对产品形象的不同选择。空气动力学的发展，曾经使流线型的造型成为一种时髦。当年著名工业设计家勒维就曾设计过顶部为圆弧的冰箱，引起过人们的非议。家庭主妇抱怨说，冰箱上面连个鸡蛋都放不住，实在不方便。后来设计的冰箱改为平板箱体造型，才更加符合实用的要求。最初采用流线型的汽车，外观象一只甲虫，使人产生一种形象不佳的联想。人们感到这车大概也像甲虫一样，只会笨拙而徐缓的爬行。而目前船型和锲型的汽车造型就避免了这种消极联想的效应，给人以庄重而明快的感觉。
    总之，工业产品的造型与艺术形象的塑造有本质的区别。艺术的形象往往是对社会生活形象的模拟，而产品形象则是其自身功能的感性呈现。产品形象的美在于体现出其自身功能结构所特有的秩序感和合目的性。产品的结构与其外在形式之间并不存在单一对应的关系，因此为人们对产品形式进行审美创造留下了广阔的余地。优秀的设计师善于利用产品质料和结构自身的美，适应人们不同的心理需求而创造出具有时代特色的产品形象。
