Two major coal mines in Hegang and Yanzhou have completed underground high-speed railways.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on March 18, China's underground coal transportation has begun using high-speed railways.

According to the China National Coal Industry Bureau, two underground high-speed railways have been completed, with speeds reaching 22 kilometers per hour. One of these railways is located at the Xingan Mine of the Hegang Mining Bureau, with a length of over 2,000 meters. The other is at the Nantun Coal Mine of the Yanzhou Mining Bureau, stretching 1,034 meters.

The running speed and transportation capacity of these underground high-speed railways are more than double that of electric locomotives, indicating that coal transportation in China's mines has entered the ranks of modernization.
