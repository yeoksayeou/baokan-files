The factory that produces the Mig-29 air superiority fighter, the Moscow Red Banner Machine Building Plant, recently opened its doors to journalists from NATO countries, allowing them to view the Mig-branded civilian machinery produced there.

This was the headline news on the front page of the Soviet Union's *Izvestia* on March 3. The report stated that journalists from the United States, Britain, and Canada recently visited this, the oldest aircraft manufacturing plant in the Soviet Union. The plant's origins trace back to a bicycle factory, which produced Russia's first aircraft in 1909. During the Great Patriotic War, the plant manufactured the Il-2 ground attack aircraft, and in the 1950s and 1960s, it produced the Il-18 turboprop airliner, which became the mainstay of Soviet civil aviation.

Since the start of reforms in the Soviet Union, the military aircraft industry not only frequently participates in international aviation exhibitions but also provides products for the commercial market.

*Izvestia* reported that the plant director believes, "Now, we only produce according to orders. The idle production equipment and technical workforce have been redirected to produce civilian consumer goods." Recently, the plant transformed food processing machinery from blueprints to prototypes in just 18 days, quickly putting them into production to supply agricultural and industrial enterprises. This year, the plant will also produce 250,000 juice squeezers and more than 20 other types of civilian consumer goods.

### 苏联改革后　军工转民用  米格机厂生产民用机械

　　苏联改革后　军工转民用
    米格机厂生产民用机械
    新华社莫斯科３月３日电  生产米格—２９型空中优势战斗机的莫斯科红旗机械厂最近对北约国家的记者敞开了大门，允许他们参观该厂生产的米格牌民用机械。
    这是苏联《消息报》３日晚的头版新闻。报道说，美国、英国和加拿大的记者最近参观了这家苏联最老的飞机制造厂。该厂的前身是自行车厂，１９０９年造出了俄国第一架飞机。此后，该厂在卫国战争中生产了伊尔—２型歼击机，在５０—６０年代生产了成为苏联民航主力飞机的伊尔—１８型涡轮螺桨客机。
    苏联开始改革后，军用飞机工业不但经常到国外参加航空展览，还提供商业市场。
    《消息报》报道说，该厂厂长认为，“现在只照订单生产，闲下的部分生产设备和技术力量已转向生产民用消费品。”该厂不久前用１８天时间便把食品加工机械由草图变成样机，很快投产，供应农工综合体企业。今年该厂还将生产２５万只果汁挤压器及２０多种其他民用消费品。
