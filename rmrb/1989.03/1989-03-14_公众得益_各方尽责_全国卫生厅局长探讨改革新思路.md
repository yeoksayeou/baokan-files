The public benefits, all parties take responsibility: National Health Bureau directors discuss new reform paths

    The People's Daily, Beijing, March 13th: Reporter Aixiao reports, Li Tieming emphasized at the closing of the national health bureau directors' meeting today that the health sector should and must deepen its reforms. He said that investment in health is as necessary for social material reproduction and population reproduction as intellectual investment. He supports Chen Minzhang's proposal to develop China's health sector by exploring the path of "the public benefits, all parties take responsibility."

    Chen Minzhang proposed at the national health bureau directors' meeting that to deepen health reforms, one must fully recognize the mutually beneficial relationship between health development and social economic development, enhance the awareness of national and individual joint investment in health, and establish the concept of "health for all, all for health." Medical and health services can benefit the nation, collectives, and individuals, so health investment should also mobilize various aspects of society to reasonably share a portion.

    Chen Minzhang believes that the current situation in China is that people's living standards have significantly improved, which provides the possibility and favorable conditions for mobilizing social groups and individuals to actively adjust their consumption structure and gradually increase the proportion of health investment. A sample survey shows that the average medical and health expenditure of rural residents has already accounted for about 2% of their per capita income. It is necessary to correctly guide people to consciously invest in health, implement collective medical funding and various forms of compensation and insurance systems in rural areas, and explore a new path to rationally divert national consumption funds and achieve social health security.

　　公众得益　各方尽责
    全国卫生厅局长探讨改革新思路
    本报北京３月１３日讯  记者艾笑报道：李铁映在今天闭幕的全国卫生厅局长会议上强调，卫生战线应该而且必须深化改革。他说，卫生事业投资和智力投资一样，是社会物质再生产和人口再生产的必要投入。他支持陈敏章提出的发展我国卫生事业，走“公众得益、各方尽责”的探索之路。
    陈敏章在全国卫生厅局长会议上提出：要深化卫生改革，就应充分认识卫生发展与社会经济发展双向促进关系，增强国家与国民共同重视健康投资的意识，确立“健康为人人，人人为健康”的观念。医疗卫生服务可以使国家、集体、个人都受益，因而卫生投资也应动员社会各方面都来合理分担一部分。
    陈敏章认为，目前我国的情况是人民生活水平有了明显提高，这就为动员社会群体和个人积极调整消费结构、逐步加大健康投资比例提供了可能性和有利条件。抽样调查表明，农村居民目前用于医疗卫生保健的平均费用，已占人均收入的２％左右。正确地引导人们自觉进行健康投资，在农村实行集资医疗和多种形式的保偿、保险制度，探索一条疏导国民消费基金合理分流，实现社会健康保障的新路，已势在必行。
