    Tibetan youth Losang Ciren follows in his father's footsteps, walks thousands of miles to enlist

    XINHUA, Shigatse, Tibet, March 1 — Tibetan youth Losang Ciren from Gyirong County braved temperatures of minus 10 degrees Celsius and walked for half a month to reach the Shigatse Military Enlistment Office on February 26 to enlist in the army.

    Losang Ciren, 19, had a father who was a deputy platoon leader in a Tibet border defense unit. In May 1973, while on a border patrol mission, he was caught in an avalanche and died a heroic death. To fulfill his father's wish, Losang Ciren resolved to join the army. When he learned that his county had no enlistment quota this year, he set out on February 12 with the encouragement of his mother, carrying a letter of recommendation from the local government and some rations. Despite the heavy snow, he embarked on a journey of over 500 kilometers to Shigatse to enlist. Along the way, he endured harsh conditions, walking by day and resting by night. After 15 days, when he arrived in Shigatse, his feet were covered in blisters, and his face and hands were cut by the cold wind.

    The leaders of the Shigatse Military Enlistment Office immediately approved his request to undergo a physical and cultural examination.

    藏族青年洛桑次仁继承父业
    徒步千里　报名参军
    本报西藏日喀则3月1日电　西藏吉隆县藏族青年洛桑次仁冒着零下10摄氏度的风雪天气，步行半个月，于2月26日来到日喀则地区征兵办公室要求参军。
    洛桑次仁今年19岁，他的父亲曾是西藏边防某部的一位副连长，1973年5月在执行边防巡逻任务中遇到雪崩光荣献身。为继承父亲的遗愿，他立志当兵。当他得知今年本县没有征兵任务时，在母亲的鼓励下，于2月12日带着当地人民政府的证明和干粮，冒着纷飞大雪，起程前往500多公里外的日喀则报名应征。一路上，风餐露饮，日行夜宿。15天后，当他到达日喀则时，双脚打满了血泡，脸和手被寒风吹出道道血口。
    地区征兵办公室的领导当即批准他参加体检文化考查。
