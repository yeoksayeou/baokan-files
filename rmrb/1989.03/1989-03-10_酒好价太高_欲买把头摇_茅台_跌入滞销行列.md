According to a report by the *Market News*, after the price adjustment of famous cigarettes and liquors on July 28 last year, the inventory of Maotai liquor significantly increased. Since January this year, the sales personnel of the Maotai Liquor Factory have changed their traditional practice of selling on-site and have actively gone to government agencies, factories, schools, and other units to promote sales, with a promotional price of 125 yuan per bottle.

A responsible person from the Light Textile Industry Bureau of Guizhou Province said that the production of Maotai Liquor Factory is currently normal. Last year, 1,300 tons were produced, and this year, 1,700 tons are planned. However, there are significant issues with sales. In previous years, by this time, the liquor had not even been packaged, and long queues of vehicles waiting to pick up the goods had already formed outside the factory gate. Some people even failed to obtain the liquor and had to seek help from others to get vouchers. Now, however, a large quantity of Maotai liquor is unsold. The main reason is that the price adjustment this time was too large, and consumers' purchasing power is limited.

In addition, Maotai liquor was listed as one of the 29 controlled commodities at the end of last year. Hotels, restaurants, and reception centers are social groups that fall within the scope of purchasing power control, and public banquets are not allowed to serve national-level famous liquors.

The export range has also been reduced from the previous 28 countries and regions to about 20.

### 酒好价太高　欲买把头摇  “茅台”跌入滞销行列

　　酒好价太高　欲买把头摇
    “茅台”跌入滞销行列
    本报讯  据《市场报》报道，去年７月２８日名烟名酒调价后，茅台酒库存大量增加。今年１月以来，茅台酒厂供销人员一改过去坐地销售的传统，主动到机关、厂矿、学校等单位上门推销，推销价每瓶１２５元。
    贵州省轻纺工业厅一位负责人说，目前茅台酒厂的生产基本正常，去年生产１３００吨，今年计划生产１７００吨。但是，销售上却大成问题。往年这个时候，酒还未包装好，厂门外提货的车辆已排成长龙，还有一些人因为弄不到酒而到处托人批条子，而今却出现了大批茅台酒卖不出去的情况。究其原因，主要就是这次调价的幅度太大，消费者的购买力还有限。
    此外，茅台酒去年底被列入２９种专控商品，宾馆、饭店、招待所都是社会集团，属于购买力控制范围，公家摆宴不准上国家级名酒。
    外销范围也由过去的２８个国家和地区减少到２０个左右。
