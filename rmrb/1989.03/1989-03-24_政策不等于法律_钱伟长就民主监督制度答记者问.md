Policy is Not the Same as Law
Qian Weichang Answers Questions on the Democratic Supervision System

The current session of the CPPCC National Committee has formulated the "Provisional Regulations of the CPPCC National Committee on Political Consultation and Democratic Supervision." This is undoubtedly a very important document for the activities of the CPPCC. This provisional regulation is not a law, but it is more than just an internal regulation of the CPPCC. What kind of document is it? How much binding force does it have?

Qian Weichang: This question has also been raised by some CPPCC members at this meeting. My view is that this provisional regulation is a policy of the Party. This regulation has been given attention and support by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which has issued a notice requiring all levels of party committees to follow it. Since it is a policy of the Party, it certainly has binding force. However, it is not a law, but a policy. Policies can change, but once they become laws, they are not easily changed. We should strive to make it into a law.

Reporter: Does the CPPCC have this problem in other aspects?

Qian Weichang: The status, role, and nature of the CPPCC are currently not clearly defined by any law; they are all defined by the Party's policies. For example, the nature of the CPPCC is a united front organization led by the Communist Party of China, which is defined by the Party's policy and not by any law. Again, the work of CPPCC members in submitting proposals: since the seventh session of the first meeting of the CPPCC, 99% of the proposals submitted by members have been responded to, and 1% have not been responded to. If they do not respond, is there any legal responsibility? Currently, there is no legal regulation. Of course, from policy to becoming a law, there is a process. The policy must mature before it can be established as a law.

　　政策不等于法律        
    钱伟长就民主监督制度答记者问
    本报记者  毕全忠
    记者：本届政协常委会制定了《政协全国委员会关于政治协商、民主监督的暂行规定》，这对政协的活动来说无疑是一个十分重要的文件。这个暂行规定并不是法律，可又不仅仅是政协内部的一个规章，它究竟是一个什么性质的文件？有多大约束力？
    钱伟长：这个问题，有的政协委员在这次会上也提出来了。我的看法是：这个暂行规定是党的政策。这个规定得到了中共中央的重视和支持，中共中央已发出通知，要求各级党委参照执行。既然是党的政策，当然有约束力。但是，它毕竟不是法律，而是政策。政策是会变的，成为法律之后就不容易变了。我们要努力使它成为法律。
    记者：政协的其他方面也存在这个问题吗？
    钱伟长：政协的地位、作用、性质等目前也还没有明确的法律规定，也还都是由党的政策规定的。例如，政协的性质是中国共产党领导的统一战线组织，这是党的政策规定的，并没有法律规定。再如政协委员的提案工作，政协七届一次会议以来，委员提案９９％得到办复，还有１％没有办复。他不办、不答复，有没有法律责任？现在没有法律规定。当然，从政策到成为法律要有个过程，政策成熟了，才能立为法律。
