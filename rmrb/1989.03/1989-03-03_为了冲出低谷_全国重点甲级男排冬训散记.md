Early spring in February, at the Hunan Chengzhou Sports Training Base, teams of tall and sturdy young men are training in the gymnasium. The first national key first-class men's volleyball winter training is taking place here in a tense and enthusiastic atmosphere.

The Fair Lady Commander Inspects the Troops

At the winter training mobilization meeting, among the more than one hundred tall and strong men, a beautiful woman is seated. She is Zhou Xiaolan, former captain of the Chinese women's volleyball team and current deputy director of the volleyball department of the State Sports Commission. The entire audience of young athletes stared at her, waiting to see how this former female volleyball hero would give the winter training mobilization speech. Unexpectedly, Zhou Xiaolan did not read from a script or give a formal speech. When she talked about young athletes learning the hardworking and pioneering spirit of old athletes, she raised her voice and asked the entire audience, "Do all the athletes present know the content of 'three from one big'? Who can stand up and answer?" A player from the Beijing team stood up and replied, "From difficulty, from strictness, from actual combat, carry out large-scale training." The audience burst into laughter...

The Old Expert Works Day and Night

The first task of the men's volleyball winter training is to improve the team spirit. The training group, composed of experts and researchers from various places, sets an example by working hard. The group leader, Wang Zuhong, vice-chairman of the Chinese Volleyball Association, left after the Spring Festival and arrived at the base on the fifth day of the first lunar month, spending the night of the 11th to check the preparations. Ji Erxian from the Jiangsu Provincial Sports Commission is a 57-year-old veteran expert. His former student, Zhou Zhihua, the former head coach of the national men's volleyball team, received the notice and could not buy a sleeper berth, enduring a 30-hour journey from Shanghai to Chengzhou.

The New Coach Demonstrates with Action

The gymnasium is brightly lit, and each team is seated in rows watching about a dozen young men training. This is the Hubei team giving a training demonstration, running the "8" shape and diving to save the ball. The players continuously leap into the air, chasing the ball thrown by the coach. Gradually, their steps slowed, their breathing became heavy, and their movements became distorted. "Stop!" Coach Zhang Renjiang shouted. He was the former captain of the Chinese men's volleyball team and had only started coaching last year. "Keep your eyes on the ball, lift your body into the air, and try to use your arms to lift the ball. Don't be afraid of falling; practicing defense is all about enduring hardship. First, you have to be fearless, and your movements won't be distorted." After saying this, he took a few steps into the court and leaped into the air. The demonstration action was accurate and beautiful, with his hands and feet completely off the ground, and his body leaping like a carp. The players, with sweat on their faces, applauded. They admired the coach's excellent skills, saw their own shortcomings, and were determined to master the basics.

    为了冲出低谷
    ——全国重点甲级男排冬训散记
    早春二月，湖南郴州体育训练基地，一队队高大英武的小伙子摔打在训练馆，第一次全国重点甲级男排冬训正在这里紧张而热烈地进行。
    俏女将会场点兵
    冬训动员大会上，百余名人高马大的男子汉中间，端坐着一位俊俏的女子。她就是原中国女排名将、现国家体委排球处副处长周晓兰。全场小伙子目光直视着她，看看这位昔日的女排骁将怎样来作冬训动员讲话。哪知周晓兰并不照本宣科做官样文章。谈到年轻运动员要学习老运动员艰苦创业的传统作风时，她略为提高声音向全场发问：“在座的运动员是不是都知道‘三从一大’的内容？请哪位站起来回答？”北京队中站起一位答道：“从难从严从实战出发，进行大运动量训练。”会场荡起了笑声……
    老专家昼夜兼程
    男排冬训第一条即抓作风。由各地抽调专家和科研人员组成的训练组以身作则。组长、中国排协副主席王祖洪过完春节，正月初五就上路，提前在11号深夜赶到基地，翌日上午便同周晓兰一起下场地、串宿舍，检查各项准备工作。江苏省体委的计尔煊，是位年已57岁的老专家，前国家男排主教练邹志华即是他的学生。他接通知后没买到卧铺挤上车，从上海到郴州整整熬了30个小时。
    新教练飞身示范
    训练馆里灯光通明，各队分队而坐观看场内十来个小伙子摔打滚翻。这是湖北队给大家上训练观摩课，跑“8”字鱼跃救球。只见队员们不停地腾身跃起，追逐着教练手中抛出的球。渐渐地脚步慢了，气息粗了，动作也变形了。“停！”张仁江教练叫道。他是原中国男排队长，去年才执教。“眼睛要看球，身体要腾空，尽量用手臂去起球。不要怕摔，练防守就是找苦吃嘛。首先要敢摔，动作才不会变形。”说完，几步走到场内，纵身一跃。这个示范动作准确而漂亮，手脚完全腾空，身体如鲤鱼打挺一般。脸上挂着汗珠的队员们鼓起掌来。他们钦佩教练的好身手，看清自己的差距，决心练好基本功。
