Title: Fault of the Name? Fault of the Person?

	It is unclear from when some manufacturers started renting booths in shopping malls, calling them "information windows": they sell goods and "collect" customer feedback on the products.

	That day, the author was at the Dongdaqiao Department Store in the children's clothing section, where a manufacturer was operating a booth (a small badge on the chest served as proof). I thought that since the manufacturer had sent someone, they should be able to introduce the features of their products and listen to customer feedback. However, no. Ask this, no answer; ask that, no knowledge. I told her that as information, she could suggest what kinds of children's clothing to produce more of. She stared into the distance with disdain. Previously, I thought this was a special case, but after observing some similar "information windows," I found that most were like this. Therefore, I have doubts about whether it can live up to its name.

	I think that the factory sending such a person to the "window" is quite unfortunate!

	There is a well-known brand of refrigerators that often advertises on television, and recently, during an evaluation for outstanding enterprise management, it was surprisingly not selected. The reason is simple: a certain consumer bought a refrigerator from this factory that had a problem. When they contacted the factory to have their maintenance department come and fix it, they were met with coldness, let alone maintenance. The judges, upon hearing of this, almost unanimously voted against it.

	This factory missed a good opportunity to gain an important honor. Is it unfair? Both unfair and not unfair. It is unfair because, overall, the quality of this factory's refrigerators is indeed good. It is not unfair because they do not pay attention to after-sales service. When products are in high demand, people become arrogant and do not value user feedback, which deserves criticism. The more famous the brand, the less it should act like a brand and put on airs; the more in demand, the more attention should be paid to product quality and service quality.

### 名之过？人之过？

　　名之过？人之过？
    小可
    不知从何日起，一些厂家在商场租柜台，其名曰信息之窗：既卖货，又“回收”顾客对产品的意见。
    那一天，笔者在东大桥百货商场卖儿童服装处，看见厂家经营的一角（胸前有小牌牌为证）。在我想来，厂家派出的，当然能介绍本厂产品的特点，又能听听顾客的意见。然而，不。你问这，没有；问那，不知道。你对她说，是否能作为信息，多生产一些什么样的儿童服装。她两眼盯着远方，不屑一顾。先前我以为是特别一例，后来观察过一些类似的“信息窗口”，发现多是如此。于是，我对它是否能名副其实，颇有怀疑。
    我想，工厂把这样的人派到“窗口”上，算是倒了邪霉！
    有一个电视常有广告、人们较为熟知的名牌电冰箱厂，在最近的一次企业管理优秀奖评选时，竟然落选了。原因很简单：某消费者买的这个厂生产的电冰箱出了毛病，和厂家联系请他们的维修部去维修，遭到了冷遇，更谈不上维修。评委们闻知此事，几乎一致投了反对票。
    这个厂家丢掉一次获得重要荣誉的好机会，冤不冤呢？又冤。又不冤。说它冤，是因为从总体看来，这个厂家的电冰箱质量确实不错。说它不冤，不注意售后服务，产品紧俏人也跟着“牛气”起来，不珍惜用户的意见了，理应受到批评。越是名牌，越不要以名牌自居摆架子，越要搞好服务；越是抢手的时候，越该注意产品质量和服务质量。
