Title: Stop the Behavior of Tearing Off Mail Stamps

We have resumed communication with our relatives in Taiwan, but every letter we receive from Taiwan has had its stamps torn off. Some envelopes are torn, and one letter was even lost.

We went to the Nanjing City Post Office and the local post office to inquire, and the postal staff said: "Taiwanese stamps are novel and attractive, and they might have been taken by postal system employees who collect stamps. Because before the mail is delivered to your mailbox, non-postal system personnel cannot come into contact with these letters. There are too many intermediate links in the mail from Taiwan, and we cannot guarantee that your stamps will not be torn off in the future."

　　制止撕揭信件邮票的行为
    我们和台湾的亲戚恢复了通信，可是，收到的每封台湾来信的邮票都被人撕去了。有的信封被撕破，有封信还遗失了。
    我们曾去南京市邮局和地段邮局查问，邮局人员回答说：“台湾邮票新奇好看，可能被邮电系统那些爱好集邮的人撕去了。因为在信件投进你的信箱前，非邮电系统人员是无法接触这些信件的。台湾来信中间环节太多，我们无法保证你的邮票今后不被撕去。”
