According to reports from our correspondents abroad, on March 20, major stock markets in the West experienced significant declines.

The Nikkei 225 Index of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, after dropping 77.23 points on March 17, plummeted another 366.21 points the following day, falling to 31,654.80 points. This was the largest single-day decline in the Tokyo stock market this year.

On the same day, the New York Stock Exchange saw not only a decline in stock prices but also a lackluster trading volume. By the end of the trading day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen to 2,262.50, a drop of 29.64 points.

The Financial Times 100 Index in London also fell by 19.5 points, closing at 2,053.6 points.

The widespread decline in Western stock markets was primarily due to increased concerns among traders that rising inflation in the United States would lead to higher interest rates.

A research report released by the University of Wisconsin-Madison on March 20 stated that the stock market crash on October 19, 1987, not only dampened public interest in stock investments but also brought personal and psychological problems to stockbrokers.

The report said that after the stock market crash, many brokers were plagued by severe depression, a result of instability, customer complaints, economic losses, and the pressure from superiors to maintain high sales volumes.

The report also indicated that since the stock market crash, the success of brokers seemed to come at the expense of their family lives. Among the brokers surveyed, one-third reported emotional crises within their families, 26% reported marital discord, 15% reported alcoholism or drug abuse at home, and 6% reported physical or mental abuse at home. The survey also found that 56.4% of the brokers' spouses suffered from severe depression after the stock market crash, and the incidence of depression among brokers was also high, at one-third.

　　西方股市普遍下跌        
    股票经纪人遭受沉重打击
    新华社北京３月２１日电  据本社驻外记者报道，２０日，西方主要股市又出现大幅度下跌。
    东京日经２２５种工业股票平均指数，继１７日下跌７７．２３点后，昨天又猛跌３６６．２１点，降到３１６５４．８０点。这是今年以来东京股市跌幅度最大的一天。
    同一天，纽约股市不仅股票价格下跌，而且交易清淡。到打烊时，道·琼斯３０种工业股票平均指数降到２２６２．５０，一天下跌２９．６４点。
    伦敦《金融时报》１００种工业股票平均指数也跌了１９．５点，到收盘时降到２０５３．６点。
    西方股市普遍下跌，主要因交易者们对美国通货膨胀上升会引起利率上升的担心加重。
    新华社纽约３月２０日电　美国威斯康星—麦迪逊大学的研究人员２０日公布的一份研究报告说，１９８７年１０月１９日发生的股市暴跌不仅削弱公众对股票投资的兴趣，而且给股票经纪人带来了家庭问题和抑郁症。
    报告说，股市暴跌后，许多经纪人忧心如焚、患了严重的抑郁症，这是不稳定、顾客的抱怨、经济损失和上司施加的要求保持高销售量的压力的结果。
    报告说，自股市暴跌以来，经纪人的成功似乎是以牺牲其家庭生活为代价而达到的。在接受调查的经纪人中，１／３的人说有一名家庭成员有感情危机问题，２６％的人报告说性生活不和谐，１５％的人说在家里有酗酒和吸毒行为，还有６％的人说在家里遭受肉体或精神虐待。调查还发现，５６．４％的经纪人的配偶在股市暴跌后患上了严重的抑郁症，经纪人中得抑郁症的比例也较高，达１／３。
