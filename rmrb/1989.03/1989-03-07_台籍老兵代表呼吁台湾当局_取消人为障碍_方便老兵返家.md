Taiwanese veterans' representatives have called on the Taiwan authorities to remove man-made obstacles and facilitate the return of veterans to their homeland.

The People's Daily, Beijing, March 6th - Correspondent Yuan Jiandá reports: The head of the Taiwan Veterans Returning Home Association today issued a statement in Beijing, urging the Taiwan authorities to remove the various man-made obstacles and allow Taiwanese veterans to return to their hometowns to reunite with their families. This statement is in response to the Taiwan authorities' regulation on December 2nd last year, which stated that former Nationalist Party Taiwanese soldiers currently stranded in mainland China can apply to return to Taiwan with their families to settle down.

He believes that Taiwanese veterans have been stranded in mainland China for over 40 years, and the vast majority have started families and established careers. They primarily hope to return to Taiwan to visit relatives and pay respects to their ancestors, rather than to settle down. Allowing them to return to Taiwan with their spouses and minor children to settle down means that their adult children will have to stay in mainland China. This will undoubtedly cause another separation of families. Therefore, this regulation is an intentional obstruction and discrimination against Taiwanese veterans.

The spokesperson criticized the Taiwan authorities for arbitrarily adding political overtones to the return of Taiwanese veterans. He said, "Today, the mainland government has abandoned past grievances and has not imposed any restrictions on Taiwanese compatriots who come to the mainland to visit relatives or travel. They are all warmly received, and even those who were anti-communist in the past are treated equally. It is hoped that the Taiwan authorities can also act on humanitarian principles, take responsibility for history, and take responsibility for the parents and siblings of Taiwanese veterans, removing all unreasonable restrictions."

It is understood that there are more than 1,000 former Nationalist Party Taiwanese soldiers currently stranded in mainland China, mainly distributed in the provinces and regions of Fujian, Shanghai, Sichuan, Shandong, and Guangdong.

　　台籍老兵代表呼吁台湾当局
    取消人为障碍　方便老兵返家
    本报北京３月６日讯  记者袁建达报道：台籍老兵返乡探亲协进会负责人今天在此间发表谈话，呼吁台湾当局取消人为设置的种种障碍，让台籍老兵顺利返回家乡与亲人团圆。这次谈话是针对去年１２月２日台湾当局关于目前滞留大陆的前国民党台籍军人可以申请携眷返台定居的规定而发表的。
    他认为，台籍老兵滞留大陆已有４０多年，绝大多数已成家立业。他们首先希望回台探亲、扫墓，而非定居。只允许他们携配偶和未成年子女返台定居，那么他们已成年子女就只能留在大陆。这样无疑会造成他们再一次的亲人分离。因此，这一规定是对台籍老兵的有意刁难和歧视。
    这位发言人指责台湾当局对台籍老兵返乡行为无端加上许多政治色彩。他说，今天，大陆政府已捐弃前嫌，对来大陆探亲旅游的台湾同胞未作任何限制，均予热情接待，即使是当年的反共人士也一视同仁。希望台湾当局也能本着人道主义原则，对历史负责，对台籍老兵的父老兄妹负责，取消一切不合理限制。
    据了解，目前滞留大陆的国民党台籍老兵有１０００余人，主要分布在福建、上海、四川、山东、广东等省区。
