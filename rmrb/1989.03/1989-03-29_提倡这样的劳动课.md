In recent years, the phenomenon of university students being "high scorers but low achievers," middle and primary school students lacking independent living skills, poor work habits, and not valuing the fruits of labor has been quite worrying.

The Beijing Municipal Education Association conducted a survey of over 2,500 middle and primary school students in 10 districts of Beijing. The results showed that 73.8% of the students have self-care abilities, 19.2% need parental assistance, and 7% are completely taken care of by their parents. In urban areas, 5.4% of high school students do not fold their own bedding, wash their own clothes, and some even do not wash their own handkerchiefs. A few high school students have their mothers help them with tasks like washing their feet and cutting their nails. This phenomenon is particularly severe in key schools. Students educated in this manner may achieve high scores, but their practical skills are lacking.

The widespread pursuit of high admission rates in the education sector and society at large is the direct cause of this phenomenon. Therefore, actively promoting labor education is an important condition for cultivating all-around talents. The 38th session of the UNESCO General Conference in 1981 emphasized the importance of integrating education with productive labor. This not only helps to cultivate skilled labor but also closely links education with the ever-changing conditions of labor, aiding in the comprehensive development of individuals. Thus, strengthening labor education and training in ordinary schools has become a significant trend in educational development worldwide, meeting the objective demands of modern society for education.

According to statistics from the State Education Commission in 1987, 76.7% of primary and secondary schools in the country have implemented labor education. Among these, only 59.5% of schools meet the curriculum standards for labor education, and this is only in terms of the number of classes taught. In reality, due to varying understandings of labor education among school teachers, as well as the lack of teaching materials, teachers, and facilities, some schools' labor classes often become mere hygiene duty classes or large-scale clean-up days, existing in name only.

Teaching labor classes effectively requires certain conditions, but we cannot wait for all conditions to be met before starting labor classes, as this would delay the development of one or even several generations. Conditions need to be created. Recently, at the invitation of the Beijing Education Association, the reporter visited a labor class at Beijing No. 12 Middle School and Beijing Kangdan Primary School, gaining much inspiration. These two schools have successfully implemented labor classes, with the main feature being practicality and simplicity, starting from cultivating students' self-living abilities and labor consciousness.

In the labor class for the second-year students at Beijing No. 12 Middle School, students voluntarily form groups to learn skills such as bicycle repair, cooking, and knitting. During the labor class for the second-grade students at Kangdan Primary School, students learn to sew buttons, embroider, tie dust mops, and make small handicrafts. The small butterflies made by the children from corn stalks and feathers are almost indistinguishable from real ones. Many of these activities are daily chores in students', families', and schools' lives, making the children very interested in learning. They do not require special labor venues, tools, or teachers. Bringing their own or their parents' and teachers' bicycles, they can disassemble, clean, and reassemble them anew; with a few yuan for a small needle and a few balls of old yarn, after a week of learning, a beautiful knitted hat can be worn on their heads. The school can hire teachers with special skills to teach labor classes. Students who learn these skills not only use them in their daily lives but also benefit from them for life. Parents happily say, "It's great that the school teaches the children these skills!"

Through labor, students not only learn skills such as bicycle repair, cooking, and knitting but also significantly enhance their thinking, creativity, and practical abilities. They also experience the hardships and joys of labor.

Such labor classes are worth promoting widely.

### 提倡这样的劳动课

　　提倡这样的劳动课
    本报记者  王娜梅
    近年来出现的大学生“高分低能”、中小学生缺乏独立生活能力、劳动习惯差、不珍惜劳动成果等现象，十分令人忧虑。
    北京市教育学会对北京１０个区县２５００余名中小学生进行过调查，７３．８％的学生有自理能力，１９．２％的学生需要家长帮助，７％的学生是由家长完全包办的。城镇５．４％的高中生自己不叠被不洗衣，甚至连自己的手帕也不洗，个别高中生洗脚、剪指甲也让妈妈帮忙。这种现象在重点校尤为严重。这样培养出来的学生虽能考高分，但动手能力差。
    教育界和整个社会普遍存在的追求升学率的错误倾向是造成这种现象的直接原因。因此，积极提倡劳动教育便构成造就全面发展人才的重要条件。１９８１年联合国教科文第３８届大会决议中指出教育与生产劳动一体化的重要性，这样不仅可造就熟练劳动力，而且使教育与日新月异的劳动条件更紧密地联系起来，并且有助于个人的全面发展，因此在普通学校中加强劳动教育和劳动训练已成为世界各国教育发展的一大趋势，这是现代社会生产对教育的客观要求。
    据国家教委１９８７年的统计，全国７６．７％的中小学开展了劳动教育。其中劳动教育达到教学大纲要求标准的学校只占学校总数的５９．５％，而且是仅就授课时数而言。实际上，由于学校教师对劳动教育认识不一以及没有教材、教师，缺乏场地等原因，一些学校的劳动课往往成为卫生值日课或大扫除，名存实亡。
    上好劳动课要具备一定的条件，但不能等一切条件都具备了才上劳动课，那将耽误一代甚至几代人。条件要自己去创造。前不久记者应北京教育学会之邀参观了北京１２中和北京看丹小学的一节劳动课，颇受启发。这两所学校劳动课开展得好，最大特点是因地制宜、因陋就简，能从实际出发、从培养学生自我生活能力开始培养学生的劳动观点。
    北京１２中初二年级的劳动课，是让学生们自愿分组学习修理自行车、烹饪、编织等技能。看丹小学二年级的劳动课上，学生们有的学钉扣子、有的学绣花、有的学绑墩布，还有的学做小工艺品，孩子们用高粱秆和羽毛做的小蝴蝶几乎可以乱真。以上不少内容都是学生、家庭、学校生活中离不开的日常劳动，孩子们学起来很感兴趣，不需要特别的劳动场地、工具和教师，搬来自己或家长、老师的自行车，就能拆卸擦洗、组装一新；几角钱一把的小钩针、几团旧毛线，经过一周的学习，一顶漂亮的绒线帽就戴到自己头上了。学校可以聘请有特长的教师承担劳动课教学任务。学生学会了这些本领不仅平常用得上，而且终身受益。家长们高兴地说：“学校教会孩子们这些活太好了！”
    学生通过劳动学会的不仅是修理自行车、做菜、编织等技能，还使他们的思维创造能力和动手能力明显增强，同时从中体会到劳动的艰辛和快乐。
    这样的劳动课值得大力提倡。
