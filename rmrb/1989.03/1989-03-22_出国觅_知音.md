Title: Seeking "Kindred Spirits" Abroad

	“This issue, a few months ago I asked several celebrities to write articles, but I haven’t seen a single word yet. I didn’t expect that you would write it. However, it’s best not to publish it for now.” A leader, after reading the thesis, summoned the author to his office. The author, of course, was unknown.

	Those “several celebrities” probably have “solved” many problems. Therefore, this “issue” naturally also had high hopes for them. Unexpectedly, “a few months” passed, but there was “not a single word,” causing him to fall from the peak of high hopes to the valley of disappointment. Just as he was worried, he saw the article written by the “unexpected” person, but it was not what he was seeking.

	Whether the article is good or bad, I will not comment. “It’s best not to publish it for now,” waiting for the “celebrities” to decide. Not judging an article by its merit, but deciding an article by “fame,” I don’t know how many people think this way. This academic hierarchy and “celebrity” tenure system makes it so that “the pupil surpasses the master” cannot “excel the master,” but is suppressed by the master, becoming a stone blocking the spring of talent. The “Chen’s Theorem” and other academic theories, therefore, need to be “exported” first, discovered and named by blue-eyed wisdom, and then “imported” again, creating a phenomenon of “seeking kindred spirits abroad and determining status upon return,” the reason for which lies here.

	Central leaders have said: In academic circles, the right and wrong of academic issues and the gains and losses of literary works, leaders should intervene and interfere less, and let them resolve through equal discussions. This is a feasible path to resolve the “feudal marriage” between academia and power, change the history of “the heavens do not change, nor does the way change” of “each leading the fashion for hundreds of years,” and adapt to the social needs of talent competition.

### 出国觅“知音”

　　出国觅“知音”
    “这个问题，几个月前我就请几位名人写文章，至今只字未见，想不到你竟写出来了。不过，最好暂不发表。”一位领导看了论文，在办公室召见作者说。作者自然是无名的。
    那“几位名人”，大概曾“解决”了许多问题。因此，“这个问题”自然也寄厚望于他们。不料，“几个月”过去了，却“只字未见”，使他从厚望的峰巅跌入失望的谷底。正在着急中，看到了“想不到”者写出的文章，但并非求之不得。
    文章是非优劣，不置品评，“最好暂不发表”，等待“名人”定夺。不以文章论名，而以“名”定文章，我不知道有多少持这种思维模式的人。这种学术等级制和“名人”终身制，使“青出于蓝”不能“胜于蓝”，而是制于蓝，成了压在人才泉眼上的石头。“陈氏定理”及其他学术理论等，所以要先“出口”，由蓝色慧眼发现定名后，再“转内销”，造成一种“出洋觅知音，回国定名分”的反常现象，原因盖出于此。
    中央领导讲过：学术上的是非和文艺作品的得失问题，领导要少介入，少干预，由他们通过平等的讨论解决。这是解决学术与权力的“封建婚姻”纠葛，改变“天不变道亦不变”的“各领风骚数百年”的历史，适应人才竞争的社会需要的可行之路。
