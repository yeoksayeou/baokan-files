West Germany and Japan are both developed industrial countries with massive trade surpluses. Due to their rapid economic growth, they have both faced pressure from the United States, which has seen a sharp increase in its trade deficit, and from Western European countries, which have experienced slow economic growth. These countries demand that West Germany and Japan take measures to open their markets, stimulate domestic demand, and reduce their trade surpluses. In other words, they want these countries to contribute to the balanced growth of the global economy. In 1988, Japan's trade surplus was $94.79 billion, a 1.7% decrease from 1987, but Western countries still exerted pressure on it and threatened to impose trade protectionism. In contrast, West Germany, which has seen continuous growth in its export trade for five years, has a much more favorable external environment, which is somewhat puzzling to outsiders.

The reason why the international community has few criticisms of West Germany's growing trade surplus can be attributed to several factors:

Firstly, although West Germany's trade surplus in 1988 increased significantly compared to 1987, the growth was mainly due to exports to Western Europe, particularly capital goods (including raw materials, machinery, and factories). At the same time, West Germany's trade surplus with the United States has been decreasing for two consecutive years. This contrasts sharply with Japan's aggressive export strategy in 1988, which primarily focused on consumer goods. France, Italy, and the United Kingdom are the main importers of West Germany's capital goods. Since these products help increase the production capacity of Western European countries and promote their economic growth, the importing countries naturally have fewer complaints about West Germany.

Secondly, unlike Japan, which expanded its exports under the appreciation of the yen, West Germany's significant increase in exports benefited greatly from the recent depreciation of the Deutsche Mark. By the end of 1988, the Deutsche Mark had depreciated by 11.2% against the US dollar compared to the end of 1987, and by 4% against the currencies of the European Monetary System countries. The depreciation of the Deutsche Mark was due to the United States' repeated interest rate hikes to curb economic overheating, which led to a high US dollar exchange rate, as well as West Germany's need to increase the supply of its own currency in the financial market to maintain the stability of the French franc and Italian lira within the European Monetary System. These factors clearly do not implicate West Germany, but West Germany's exports have benefited significantly from the currency depreciation.

Thirdly, while West Germany's exports continued to grow at record levels, imports also increased significantly. In 1988, West Germany's exports grew by 7.7% compared to 1987, and imports grew by 7.4%, with the growth rates of imports and exports almost equal. This was the fastest year of import growth for West Germany since 1986. Although this growth rate is still far from Japan's, considering the small domestic market and the basic policy of stable currency in West Germany, achieving this result is quite impressive.

In fact, what other Western countries are currently concerned about is the overheating of the West German economy, rather than its trade surplus. Due to the rapid growth of exports and domestic demand, the operating rate of West German enterprises in 1988 reached 88%. Economic overheating can lead to inflation and may result in higher interest rates and turbulence in the international financial market. West Germany is the economic leader of Western Europe. The future development of the West German economy cannot but attract the high attention of its Western partners.

### 西德贸易盈余增长  何故未遭责难？

　　西德贸易盈余增长        
    何故未遭责难？
    蒋千红
    西德、日本，都是拥有巨额贸易盈余的发达工业国家，由于经济实力的迅速增长，它们也都受到近年来贸易逆差激增的美国和经济增长缓慢的西欧国家的压力，要其采取措施开放市场，刺激内需，减少贸易盈余。一句话，要它们为世界经济的均衡增长做出贡献。１９８８年，日本贸易顺差为９４７．９亿美元，比１９８７年降低１．７％，但西方国家仍向它施加压力，并以贸易保护主义相威胁。而出口贸易连续五年增长的西德，外部环境却要好得多，这就不免使局外人感到蹊跷。
    外界对西德贸易盈余增长少有责备，原因大致有以下几点：
    其一，西德去年的贸易盈余虽在总体上较１９８７年有较大幅度增加，但增长部分主要是对西欧的出口，其中又以资本货物（包括原料、机器和厂房）增长的比重最大。同时，西德对美国的贸易顺差已是连续两年下降。这就同１９８８年恢复凌厉的出口攻势、出口产品又以消费品为主的日本形成鲜明的对照。法国、意大利、英国是西德资本货物的主要进口国。由于这类产品有利于增加西欧国家的生产能力，促进其经济增长，进口国对西德自然少有烦言。
    其二，同在日元升值形势下扩大出口的日本不同，西德出口的大幅度增长在很大程度上受惠于近几个月来西德马克的贬值。西德马克对美元１９８８年末比１９８７年末贬值１１．２％，对欧洲货币体系国家的货币贬值４％。马克贬值原因既有美国为抑制经济过热而不断上调利率，从而引起美元汇率高启，又有西德为维持法国法郎、意大利里拉在欧洲货币体系中币值的稳定，不得不向金融市场增加本国货币供给的因素。这些板子显然都打不到西德的屁股上，而西德的出口却由于货币贬值而获益非浅。
    其三，在西德出口继续呈创纪录增长的同时，进口也有了大幅度增加。１９８８年，西德出口比１９８７年增长７．７％，进口增长７．４％，进出口增长幅度几乎持平。这是自１９８６年以来西德进口增长速度最快的一年。尽管这一增长幅度还远远比不上日本，但考虑到西德国内市场狭小和实行稳定货币的基本政策，取得这一成绩已是很能堵住别人的嘴了。
    其实，其他西方国家目前担忧的主要是西德国内的经济过热，而不是它的贸易盈余。由于出口和国内需求同时迅速增长，１９８８年西德企业的开工率已达８８％。经济过热会引起通货膨胀，并可能导致利率抬高和国际金融市场的动荡。西德是西欧经济的老大哥。西德经济今后的发展动向，不能不引起它的西方伙伴的高度关注。
