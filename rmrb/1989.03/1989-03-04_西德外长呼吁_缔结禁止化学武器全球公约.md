Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 2nd.

West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher warned on March 2nd at the United Nations Disarmament Conference in Geneva that if a comprehensive global convention to ban chemical weapons is not concluded and implemented, the danger of their proliferation and use will increase. Genscher called on representatives of countries participating in the United Nations Disarmament Conference to accelerate the negotiations for a global chemical weapons convention.

In discussing the involvement of some West German companies in the proliferation of chemical weapons, he pointed out that this directly affects West Germany's reputation. He said that the West German government is taking a series of measures to prevent West German companies or individuals from participating in the manufacture of chemical weapons in other countries.

However, he also noted that due to the lack of a global convention, neither national nor international measures can effectively prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons. He said, "Only by concluding a global, effectively verifiable convention that completely prohibits the development, production, possession, acquisition, transfer, and use of chemical weapons, and by completely destroying existing chemical weapons under international supervision, is there no other choice."

Genscher optimistically pointed out that, with political will, the issues hindering the conclusion of a global convention could be resolved by the end of this year.

　　西德外长呼吁
    缔结禁止化学武器全球公约
    新华社日内瓦３月２日电  西德外长根舍２日在日内瓦联合国裁军会议上警告说，如果不缔结并履行一项全面禁止化学武器的全球性公约，扩散和使用化学武器的危险就会增加。根舍在发言中呼吁参加联合国裁军会议的各国代表加速化学武器全球公约的谈判。
    他在谈到西德一些公司介入化学武器扩散一事时指出，这直接影响到西德的信誉。他说，西德政府正采取一系列措施，防止西德的公司或个人参与在别国制造化学武器的活动。
    然而他又认为，由于尚未缔结全球性公约，国家或国际性措施都不能有效地防止化学武器的扩散。他说，“只有缔结一项全球性的、有效核查的公约，完全禁止研制、生产、拥有、获得、转让和使用化学武器，并在国际监督下彻底销毁现存的化学武器，别无其他选择。”
    根舍乐观地指出，只要有政治诚意，那些阻碍达成全球性公约的问题在今年年底之前有可能得到解决。
