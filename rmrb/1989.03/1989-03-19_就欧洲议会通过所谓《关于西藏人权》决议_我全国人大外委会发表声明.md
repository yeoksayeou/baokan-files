The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China's Foreign Affairs Committee issued a statement today regarding the European Parliament's adoption of the so-called "Resolution on Human Rights in Tibet." The full text of the statement is as follows:

	1. Despite repeated warnings and serious representations from the Chinese side, the European Parliament went ahead and adopted a so-called "Resolution on Human Rights in Tibet" on March 16. This resolution irrationally criticizes the legitimate measures taken by China to maintain social order in Lhasa and to safeguard national unity, distorts the correct policies of the Chinese government in Tibet regarding nationality and religion, and openly pressures the Chinese government on the so-called "Tibet issue." The European Parliament's actions constitute a gross interference in China's internal affairs. We express strong indignation and deep regret over this.

	2. The events that occurred in Lhasa in early March were neither ethnic nor religious issues, nor were they human rights issues. Instead, they were violent actions instigated by a few separatist elements aiming to split the motherland. These individuals raised the slogan of "Tibet independence," engaged in acts of beating, smashing, looting, and arson, resulting in multiple casualties and significant property damage, severely disrupting social order. They even openly fired at police on duty. The violent actions of these separatist elements are intolerable to any sovereign state. The necessary measures taken by the Chinese government to maintain law and order are completely legitimate and beyond reproach. The situation in Lhasa has now basically stabilized, and social life is returning to normal.

	It should be pointed out that this incident was instigated by external forces attempting to split China. They smuggled weapons into the country and incited the riot. We regret that some members of the European Parliament have aligned themselves with these separatist elements.

	3. Tibet has been an inseparable part of China's sacred territory since the 13th century, and the Tibetan people are members of the great family of the Chinese nation. This is a fact recognized by all countries, including the member states of the European Community. Any attempt to internationalize the Tibet issue under the pretext of human rights is firmly opposed by the Chinese government and people and will never succeed. The European Parliament's disregard for basic international norms and attempt to interfere in the Tibet issue and China's internal affairs is unacceptable to the Chinese people.

	4. It is well known that Tibet was previously under a feudal serfdom system that was even darker and more brutal than that of medieval Europe. Under that system, the Tibetan people had no basic personal freedom, let alone human rights. It was only after the abolition of the serfdom system that the broad masses of the Tibetan people enjoyed unprecedented democracy and freedom. In the past decade, the central government has implemented a series of special preferential policies for the Tibet Autonomous Region. Tibet has made widely recognized progress in various fields such as economy, culture, and education. The Tibetan people enjoy full democratic rights and religious freedom under the Constitution and practice regional ethnic autonomy. It is astonishing that the European Parliament ignores such obvious facts.

	5. Regarding the issue of negotiating with the Dalai Lama, our position has always been clear. The central government of the People's Republic of China is willing and prepared to negotiate with the Dalai Lama. Recently, external separatist forces have created unrest, poisoning the atmosphere for improving relations between the Dalai Lama and the central government. We believe that negotiations must be conducted under the premise of safeguarding national unity. Tibet independence is out of the question, semi-independence is out of the question, and disguised independence is also out of the question. The central government's negotiations with the Dalai Lama do not allow any foreign government, organization, or individual to intervene. The European Parliament's resolution calling for the European Community member states to engage in so-called "mediation" is firmly opposed and unacceptable to us.

	6. The National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China highly values and has always been committed to developing friendly and cooperative relations with the European Parliament. However, some members of the European Parliament have repeatedly interfered in China's internal affairs, greatly hurting the national feelings of the Chinese people. We strongly demand that the European Parliament immediately stop interfering in China's internal affairs and avoid damaging bilateral relations.

### 就欧洲议会通过所谓《关于西藏人权》决议  我全国人大外委会发表声明

　　就欧洲议会通过所谓《关于西藏人权》决议
    我全国人大外委会发表声明
    新华社北京３月１８日电  全国人民代表大会外事委员会今天就欧洲议会通过所谓《关于西藏人权》决议发表声明。声明全文如下：
    一、欧洲议会不顾中国方面的多次劝阻和严正交涉，竟于３月１６日通过一项所谓《关于西藏人权》的决议。这一决议无理指责中国为保障拉萨正常社会秩序和维护祖国统一而采取的正当措施，歪曲中国政府在西藏实行的正确的民族和宗教政策，并公然就所谓西藏问题向中国政府施加压力。欧洲议会这一举动是对中国内政的粗暴干涉。我们表示强烈的愤慨和极大的遗憾。
    二、３月上旬在拉萨发生的事件，既不是民族、宗教问题，也不是什么人权问题，而是少数分裂主义分子蓄意制造的分裂祖国的暴力行动。这些人提出“西藏独立”的口号，打、砸、抢、烧，造成了多起人员伤亡和重大财产损失，严重破坏了社会秩序。他们还公然向值勤的警察开枪。这些分裂主义分子违反法律的暴力行为是任何主权国家都不能容忍的。我国政府为了维护法律和秩序而采取的必要措施是完全正当的、无可非议的。目前拉萨局势已基本稳定，社会生活趋于正常。
    应该指出的是，这次事件是由国外妄图分裂中国的势力一手挑起的。他们派人偷运武器入境，策动暴乱。我们深感遗憾的是，欧洲议会的某些人竟然与这些分裂分子遥相呼应。
    三、西藏从公元１３世纪起就是中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，藏族人民是中华民族大家庭的一员，这是世界各国包括欧洲共同体各成员国政府所公认的事实。任何以人权为借口使西藏问题国际化的企图，都是中国政府和人民所坚决反对的，也是绝不会得逞的。欧洲议会无视起码的国际关系准则，企图插手西藏问题、干涉中国内政，这是中国人民决不允许的。
    四、众所周知，西藏过去实行的是比欧洲中世纪制度还要黑暗、残暴的农奴制。在那个制度下，西藏人民连最起码的人身自由都没有，根本谈不上什么“人权”。正是在摆脱了农奴制度后，广大西藏人民才享受到从未有过的广泛的民主和自由。近１０年来，中央人民政府对西藏自治区采取了一系列特殊的优惠政策。西藏自治区在经济、文化、教育等各个领域都取得了公认的进步。藏族人民依照宪法实行民族区域自治，并享有充分的民主权利和宗教信仰自由。欧洲议会对如此明显的客观事实竟然视而不见，这不能不令人感到吃惊。
    五、关于同达赖喇嘛谈判的问题，我们的态度一直是明确的。我国中央人民政府愿意并准备同达赖喇嘛进行谈判。最近国外分裂主义势力制造骚乱，毒化了达赖喇嘛同中央人民政府改善关系的气氛。我们认为，谈判必须在维护祖国统一的大前提下进行，西藏独立不行，半独立不行，变相独立也不行。我国中央人民政府同达赖的谈判决不允许任何外国政府、组织或个人插手。欧洲议会决议要求欧洲共同体成员国进行所谓“斡旋”，这是我们坚决反对，不能接受的。
    六、中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会十分珍视并一贯致力于发展同欧洲议会的友好合作关系，但欧洲议会的一些人却一再干涉中国内政，极大地伤害了中国人民的民族感情。我们强烈要求欧洲议会立即停止干涉中国内政的行动，避免给双边关系带来损害。
