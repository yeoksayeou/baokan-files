Tianmen City is one of the regions in our province where rural cable broadcasting networks are relatively well-developed. However, in recent years, the situation of broadcasting lines being stolen has been quite serious. According to incomplete statistics, in 1988, the entire city reported over 450 cases of broadcasting line theft, with over 2,400 kilograms of broadcasting lines stolen. Last year, just in Tuoshi Township, there were over 50 cases of broadcasting line theft, with over 400 kilograms of lines stolen. Even more serious is that in this township, while repairing the broadcasting lines, lines installed during the day would be stolen at night, sometimes even being stolen three or four times in a single day.

We appeal to the relevant departments to take measures, crack down on lawbreakers, and ensure the smooth operation of rural cable broadcasting networks.

　　农村广播网破坏严重
    天门市是我省农村有线广播网搞得比较好的地区之一，但近年来，广播线路被盗情况相当严重。据不完全统计，１９８８年，全市发生广播线被盗案件４５０多起，被盗广播线达２４００多公斤。去年，仅拖市乡就发生广播线被盗案件５０多起，广播线被盗４００多公斤。更为严重的是，这个乡在维修广播线路时，白天架线，晚上广播线就被偷盗，有时竟然一天内被盗三四次。
    呼吁有关部门采取措施，打击不法分子，以保证农村有线广播网的畅通。
