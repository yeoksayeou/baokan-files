	The Key to Clean Governance Lies in Strict Institutions

	People's Representative and Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Chen Guangyi, discussed his thoughts on the government work report delivered by Premier Li Peng. He emphasized that the key to clean governance lies in strict institutions.

	Fujian's clean governance pilot project last year was conducted in 25 departments and 16 counties and cities, totaling 58 pilot points. The Provincial Committee stipulated that while focusing on ideological education and investigating major cases, each pilot point should address issues that the public is most concerned about, most discussed, and most prone to loopholes. These include credit, material allocation, engineering contracting, approval for overseas travel, conversion from agricultural to non-agricultural status, relocation of household registration, tax collection, confiscation of property, issuance of business licenses, land allocation, construction of buildings, as well as recruitment of workers, cadres, students, and the allocation of graduates from colleges and universities. These "hot spots" were regulated to standardize work and institutionalize procedures. This move was welcomed by all sectors of society.

	Chen Guangyi said that previously, some departments and units had their own regulations, but few actually followed them. Why? Because enforcement was not strict, and there were difficulties in following the rules. Therefore, the essence of clean governance lies in strict institutions, which include both the establishment of institutions and their enforcement. Enforcement of institutions must emphasize "seriousness" and cannot leave room for flexibility or special policies. It must be as strict as a high-voltage power line in the air, which no one dares to touch.

	Chen Guangyi said that the reason the clean governance pilot project was welcomed was that the procedures for handling matters were made public and transparent, allowing the public to supervise. Regardless of who it is, if they violate the regulations and party discipline, they must be strictly constrained. As long as there are strict institutions and supervision from all directions, clean governance is guaranteed.

　　廉政关键在于严格制度
    新华社记者  蔡珪村
    人大代表、中共福建省委书记陈光毅审议李鹏总理政府工作报告时，结合福建省去年的廉政建设试点经验谈了体会。他指出：廉政建设的关键在于严格制度。
    福建去年的廉政试点，是在省直机关２５个部门和１６个县市进行的，共有５８个试验点。省委规定，在抓思想教育、查处大案要案的同时，各试验点要把当前群众最关心，议论最多，又最容易出漏洞的信贷、物资分配、工程承包、审批出境出国、农转非、迁移户口、征收税费、罚没财物、发放工商执照、批地盖房，以及招工、招干、招生和大中专毕业生分配等“热点”订出条条，使工作规范化，办事制度化。此举受到社会各界的欢迎。
    陈光毅说，以前一些部门、单位也订有自己的制度，但真正能按制度办事的并不多，原因何在？就是“执法”不严，有章难循。所以，廉政建设的根本在于严格制度，而严格制度包括订制度和执行制度两方面。执行制度，一定要强调“严肃性”，绝不能在执行中“留有余地”，搞“特殊政策、灵活措施”。要严得像架在空中的高压电线一样，谁也不敢去碰它。
    陈光毅说，廉政建设试点之所以受到欢迎，就是办事制度公开有了尺度；办事结果公开有了透明度，使群众便于监督。不论是谁，只要是违反了制度，违反了党纪党规，就要严格地受到制约。只要有了严格的制度，又有来自四面八方的监督，廉政是有保证的。
