	Who Issues the Permit, Who Sells? Every Case Must Be Investigated Thoroughly
	Strengthen Management and Supervision, Tighten Every Link
	Henan Cracks Down on Fertilizer Market

	BEIJING, March 11 (Xinhua) -- The media's criticism of the chaotic management of the fertilizer market in Kaifeng and other places, where multiple parties profit and farmers are exploited, has drawn the attention of the Henan Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government. They have clearly stated that they welcome and support the media's supervision. Serious issues of using power for personal gain and interfering with the implementation of fertilizer monopoly policies must be thoroughly investigated and severely dealt with.

	To this end, Governor Cheng Weigao has proposed five specific opinions:

	--- Thoroughly investigate the sources of black-market fertilizers. Who issued the permits, to whom they were issued, and who sold them must be investigated case by case. All violations of monopoly regulations and misuse of power to issue permits for personal favors must be investigated and dealt with seriously according to the circumstances.

	--- Organize the departments of industry and commerce, petrochemicals, prices, and supply and marketing to immediately conduct a comprehensive inspection of fertilizer sales across the province.

	--- Further strengthen and improve the fertilizer monopoly management system. For locally produced fertilizers that can be directly supplied, local governments can approve direct supply after examination.

	--- Implement an open supervision system. Publicize the quantities of procurement and sales, and the distribution methods, and accept public supervision.

	--- All levels of government and relevant departments must strengthen their leadership over fertilizer production and sales. No one is allowed to interfere with the monopoly work.

　　谁批条谁倒卖　件件查清
    重管理重监督　环环抓紧     
    河南整顿化肥市场
    本报郑州３月１１日电  记者李而亮报道：新闻单位对开封等地化肥市场管理混乱、多方渔利、坑害农民问题的批评，引起河南省委、省政府的关注。他们明确表示，欢迎支持新闻单位的舆论监督，对以权谋私、干扰化肥专营工作落实的严重问题，要彻底查清、严肃处理。
    为此，省长程维高提出了五点具体意见：
    ——彻底查清黑市中化肥的来源，谁批的，批给谁的，谁倒卖的要一件件查清楚，而且要把所有违犯专营规定、利用职权批条子送人情的问题查清，分别情况严肃处理。
    ——组织工商、石油化工、物价、供销等部门，立即在全省开展化肥销售大检查。
    ——进一步加强完善化肥专营管理办法。凡是能够实行直供的地产化肥，经当地政府批准可以直供。
    ——实行公开监督制度。公开采购、销售数量、分配办法，接受群众监督。
    ——各级政府、有关部门要切实加强对化肥生产、销售的领导，任何人都不准干扰专营工作。
