More than 2,500 women from various circles in the capital gathered at the Great Hall of the People this morning to celebrate International Women's Day and the 40th anniversary of the founding of the All-China Women's Federation.

Yang Shangkun, Hu Qili, Song Renqiong, Yan Mingfu, Chen Pixian, Hab Zhen, Lei Jieqiong, and Kang Keqing came to be among the women, congratulating them on their holiday and posing for a group photo with representatives of the national "March 8th Red Banner Holders," outstanding women's federation cadres, and veteran women workers.

On behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, Chen Muxia, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the All-China Women's Federation, extended her highest respect to women of all ethnic groups who have made outstanding contributions to the prosperity and development of the republic. She also extended warm greetings to sisters in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao, and to overseas Chinese sisters. She expressed heartfelt congratulations to the 1,008 "March 8th Red Banner Holders," 504 outstanding women's federation cadres, and nearly 7,000 veteran women workers who received honorary titles and certificates this time!

Chen Muxia said, "This year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the All-China Women's Federation. The basic experience of the All-China Women's Federation over 40 years is: to carry out women's work independently under the leadership of the Communist Party, to seek the progress and development of women from the progress and development of society, and at the same time, women should strive through their own efforts and contributions to gain social understanding and recognition. This is the basic path of the contemporary Chinese women's liberation movement."

Huang Qixian, Vice President and Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, read out the decision of the All-China Women's Federation to commend the national "March 8th Red Banner Holders," to commend outstanding women's federation cadres, and to award honorary certificates and commemorative medals to veteran women workers who have worked in the women's federation for more than 30 years. Kang Keqing, as an old leader of the women's liberation movement, received the honorary certificate and commemorative medal for veteran women workers from President Yang Shangkun. Also receiving the honorary certificates and commemorative medals were Cai Chang and Deng Yingchao.

Zhang Zhenying, Vice President and First Secretary of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, presided over the meeting. Li Jinzhao, former president of the Shaanxi Provincial Women's Federation, Jin Hua, president of the Gongzhuling City Women's Federation in Jilin Province, and Jin Qingmin, the first woman to climb the "death zone" of the Antarctic interior, representing veteran women workers, outstanding women's federation cadres, and national "March 8th Red Banner Holders," respectively, spoke at the meeting.

　　首都各界妇女集会庆“三八”
    妇联表彰千余“三八”红旗手五百多优秀妇联干部
    同时授予近七千老妇女工作者荣誉证书和纪念章
    本报北京３月７日讯  记者冯媛报道：首都各界２５００多名妇女今天上午欢聚在人民大会堂，庆祝三八国际劳动妇女节暨全国妇联成立４０周年。
    杨尚昆、胡启立、宋任穷、阎明复、陈丕显、习仲勋、雷洁琼、康克清来到妇女中间，向她们祝贺节日，并和全国“三八”红旗手、全国优秀妇联干部和老妇女工作者代表合影留念。

    陈慕华说，今年是中华全国妇女联合会成立４０周年。全国妇联４０年的基本经验是：坚持在共产党的领导下独立自主地开展妇女工作，从社会的进步与发展中求妇女的进步与发展，同时，妇女要通过自己的拚搏与贡献去争取社会的理解与承认。这是当代中国妇女解放运动的基本道路。
