Gorbachev Proposes New Agricultural Policy at CPSU Central Committee Plenum

Fundamental Transformation of Rural Economic Relations to Pave the Way for Various Forms of Management

Gorbachev, the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, delivered a report titled "On the Party's Agricultural Policy Under Modern Conditions" at the expanded plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee, which began today. In his report, he proposed a new agricultural policy aimed at restoring the status of peasants as landowners, thereby reliably solving the food problem and adjusting the urban-rural relationship.

The core idea of this new policy is to "fundamentally transform rural economic relations," and "changing the existing views on socialist ownership from both theoretical and practical perspectives" is the key to implementing this policy.

In summarizing the lessons learned from Soviet agriculture during the Soviet regime, Gorbachev first emphasized the need to establish production relations and management forms that ensure the firm position of peasants as landowners. He stressed that "it is necessary to provide broad opportunities for peasants to demonstrate independence, initiative, and proactivity," "resolutely overcome the indifference of rural laborers towards the ownership that currently only formally belongs to them," and "broadly utilize various forms of management and economic accounting relations to thoroughly change the forms of realizing socialist ownership rights." He suggested opening the door to various forms of management. He called for a new attitude towards the labor of individual peasant families.

How to view the leasehold system is another prominent issue. Since the Soviet Union began implementing the leasehold system, people have had various different views. Gorbachev clearly pointed out that "developing leasehold relations in rural areas is the most important, perhaps decisive, path to reforming socialist ownership relations in the current stage." He also emphasized that various forms of leasing can be developed, and stockholding can be adopted.

This CPSU Central Committee General Secretary pointed out that there is inevitably a transitional period from the start of agricultural reform to the full functioning of the new economic mechanism, during which various forms, including state orders, should be utilized.

Agricultural reform cannot avoid the price issue. There is a significant disconnect between the procurement, wholesale, and retail prices of agricultural products in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev suggested in his report that flexible procurement prices for agricultural products should be implemented starting from January 1, 1990.

The new agricultural policy emphasizes expanding the autonomy of local grassroots production units and opposing administrative command leadership methods. Gorbachev proposed to the plenary session to completely abolish the district agro-industrial associations, dissolve the State Agro-Industrial Committee, and establish a Food and Procurement Committee affiliated with the Council of Ministers to be responsible for developing agro-industrial complexes and organizing food supply.

　　戈尔巴乔夫在苏共中央全会提出新农业政策
    根本变革农村经济关系  要为各种经营形式开路
    据新华社莫斯科３月１５日电  苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫在今天开始举行的苏共中央扩大全会上作了题为《关于在现代条件下党的农业政策》的报告。他在报告中提出了一项旨在恢复农民作为土地主人的地位，从而可靠地解决食品问题和调整好城乡关系的新的农业政策。
    这项新政策的核心思想是“根本变革农村的经济关系”，而“从理论和实践上改变现有的看待社会主义所有制的观点”是贯彻这一政策的关键。
    戈尔巴乔夫在总结苏维埃政权期间苏联农业方面的教训时，首先强调要建立能保证农民作为土地主人的牢固地位的生产关系和经营形式，强调“应该给农民表现独立性、进取性和主动性提供广阔的可能性”，“坚决克服农村劳动者对目前只是形式上属于他们的所有权的冷漠态度”，“需要广泛利用多种经营形式和经济核算关系来彻底改变实现社会主义所有者权利的形式”。他建议，要为各种经营形式敞开道路。他呼吁用新的态度对待农民一家一户的劳动。
    如何对待租赁制是又一突出的问题。苏联开始实行租赁制以来，人们产生了各种不同的看法。戈尔巴乔夫明确指出，“在农村发展租赁关系是改革社会主义所有制关系最重要的，也许在当前这一阶段是决定性的途径。”他还强调，可发展多种形式的租赁，并且可以采取股份制。
    这位苏共中央总书记指出，从开始农业改革到新的经济机制充分起作用之间不可避免要有一个过渡阶段，在这期间应该利用包括国家订货在内的各种形式。
    农业改革不能回避价格问题。苏联农产品的收购、批发和零售价之间存在着很大的脱节现象。戈尔巴乔夫在报告中建议，从１９９０年１月１日起对农产品实行灵活的收购价。
    新的农业政策强调扩大地方的基层生产单位的自主权，反对行政命令的领导方法。戈尔巴乔夫向全会建议全面取消区农工联合公司，撤消国家农工委员会，成立一个附属于部长会议的粮食和收购委员会来负责发展农工综合体和组织食品供应。
