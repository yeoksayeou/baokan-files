Currently, the number of ships navigating the Yangtze River has increased severalfold compared to ten years ago, which has brought many new challenges to the oil supply management work.

The oil used by ships is highly flammable and explosive. According to relevant safety regulations, water-based oil stations, oil storage facilities, oil barges, and ship berthing points must maintain a certain safe distance from urban ports, docks, bridges, buildings, and other structures. They should not be near passenger and cargo docks, and there should be no open flames within a 50-meter radius. However, at present, along the Yangtze River route, various ports, including some major cities' large ports and urban docks, have numerous unauthorized water-based oil stations, oil storage facilities, oil barges, and ship berthing points, lacking proper fire safety distances.

For example, in the Chongqing Port area, from the upper and lower reaches of the Chaotianmen Central Dock to the Tongyuanju Dock and the Chaoyang River Dock over a 10-kilometer stretch of the river, there are 9 oil stations and oil storage facilities, oil barges, and ship berthing points. Along the less than 4,000-meter stretch of the Jialing River from the Chaotianmen Dock to Zengjiayan, there are 12 oil stations and oil storage facilities, oil barges, and ship berthing points. These oil stations and berthing points are managed by 14 different units, most of which are set up independently by the users. The oil storage capacity of these stations and points ranges from a few dozen tons to 2,000 tons, with an annual oil throughput of over 230,000 tons. Within these port areas, there are 151 passenger and cargo docks, with over 2,000 large and small passenger and cargo ships berthed, and the surrounding areas of the oil stations, storage facilities, barges, and ship berthing points are almost all ships using open flames.

It is suggested that relevant departments conduct a thorough inspection and rectification of the oil stations, storage facilities, barges, and ship berthing points along the Yangtze River. Those that do not meet fire safety standards should be relocated. Additionally, it is recommended to reform the current decentralized management system of oil supply for Yangtze River navigation. Relevant departments should take over the unified management of navigation oil supply, establish public water-based refueling stations along the river, and be responsible for the oil supply work for navigation.

### 建立统一的长航油料管理体制

　　建立统一的长航油料管理体制
    目前，在长江上航行的船只数量比１０年前增长了几倍，这给油料供应管理工作带来许多新问题。
    船舶用的油料易燃、易爆。按有关安全的规定，供应储存船舶油料的水上油站和油囤、油驳、油船停泊点，必须与城区港口、码头、桥梁、房屋等建筑物有一定的安全距离，不能靠近客货码头，周围５０米的范围内不得有明火。但是，现在长江航线各港区，即使是一些大城市的大型港口、城区码头，也到处违章设置水上油站和油囤、油驳、油船停泊点，没有防火安全距离。
    例如，重庆港朝天门中心码头上下游港区、铜元局码头至朝阳河码头１０多公里的江段上，就有９个油站和油囤、油驳和油船停泊点；在朝天门码头至曾家岩不到４０００米的嘉陵江江段上，就有１２个油站和油囤、油驳、油船停泊点。这些油站和停泊点，分别属于１４个单位，其中绝大多数是使用单位自行选点擅自设置的。这些油站和停泊点的油料常储量，少则１０多吨，多则２０００吨，每年进出油料达２３万多吨。在这些港区内，有客货运码头１５１个，停泊大小客货船２０００多艘，油站和油囤、油驳、油船停泊点的周围几乎都是使用明火的船只。
    建议有关部门对长江各港区的油站和油囤、油驳、油船停泊点进行一次清理整顿，对不符合防火安全要求的，要督促有关单位搬迁。此外，改革长江航运油料自供自存分散管理的体制，由有关部门统一经营管理航运油料，在沿江设立水上公共加油站，负责航运油料的供应工作。
