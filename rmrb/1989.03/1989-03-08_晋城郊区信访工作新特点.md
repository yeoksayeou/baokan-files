In 1988, the petition office of our district received a total of 155 letters from the masses and 197 visits. The issues reflected in these letters and visits have changed significantly compared to the past:

Economic disputes have increased. There were 56 cases in total throughout the year, making it the main focus of petitions. These include issues such as unequal contract terms, difficulties in fulfilling contracts upon expiration, frequent looting of orchards, and chaotic price increases for daily necessities.

Group petitions have become more frequent. There were 3 group petitions involving 137 people throughout the year. In mid-June, 47 people from Ludian Village, Chuandi Township, went to the district government to report that the mining activities of Shangliu Coal Mine had caused cracks in the residents' houses, posing a threat to their property and safety. The district government held several meetings of the district mayor's office and decided that Shangliu Coal Mine and Dongyan Coal Mine would compensate for the losses amounting to 430,000 yuan.

Attention to cadre issues. Throughout the year, 35 letters reflected issues such as cadres using their power for personal gain, illegally occupying arable land, and having poor work styles, an increase from 1987. Zhang Shuangxi from Liu Village, Xiaocun Township, fearlessly reported multiple times about the financial chaos and tax evasion issues in the village's coal mine. After investigation and rectification by relevant departments, 430,000 yuan in taxes were recovered for the state, and 2 million yuan in income was increased for the masses. Some party members and villagers from Zhujiayao Village, Xiaocun Township, wrote letters reflecting the issue of village cadres illegally occupying and demarcating arable land. After verification, the party branch secretary and the village committee director were dismissed from their posts and received disciplinary actions.

　　晋城郊区信访工作新特点
    １９８８年，我区信访办公室共受理群众来信１５５件，来访１９７人次。这些来信来访反映的问题，与过去相比，发生了很大的变化：
    经济纠纷上升。全年共５６件，已成为群众上访的重点。其中包括承包条件不平等、合同到期难兑现、果园屡遭哄抢、生活必需品乱涨价等等问题。
    集体上访增多。全年集体上访３批１３７人次。６月中旬，川底乡芦庄村４７人到区政府反映，上六煤矿采矿造成住户房屋裂缝，影响财产生命安全问题。区政府多次召开区长办公会，决定由上六煤矿和东掩煤矿赔偿损失４３万元。
    关注干部问题。全年来信中，有３５件反映干部以权谋私、乱占耕地及作风败坏等问题，数量比１９８７年增加。下村乡刘村张双喜不畏权势，多次来信反映本村煤矿财务混乱、偷税漏税等问题，经有关部门调查整顿，为国家收回税款４．３万元，为群众增加收入２０万元。下村乡朱家窑村一些党员和群众来信，反映本村干部乱占乱划耕地问题，查实后，村党支部书记、村委会主任等分别被撤职和受到党纪处分。
