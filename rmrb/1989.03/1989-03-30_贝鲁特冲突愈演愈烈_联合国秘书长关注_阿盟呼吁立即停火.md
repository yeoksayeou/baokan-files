Beirut Conflict Escalates

UN Secretary-General Expresses Concern, Arab League Calls for Immediate Ceasefire

BEIRUT, March 28 (Xinhua) — The fighting between the Lebanese Christian military government and Syrian forces along with Lebanese Muslim militias in Beirut intensified on March 27.

According to local newspapers, citing the words of government military chief General Aoun, they repelled an all-night assault led by Syrian tanks, killing 15 Syrian soldiers, destroying two Syrian tanks, and one missile base.

There have been no reports from the Syrian military and Muslim militias so far.

During the night of March 27, both sides bombarded each other's positions with artillery, firing approximately 5,000 shells in total.

Since March 14, the sound of gunfire and artillery has not stopped in Beirut, with 84 people killed and about 355 injured. Military experts here estimate that the war causes daily economic losses of $135,000.

UNITED NATIONS, March 28 (Xinhua) — UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today expressed concern over the worsening situation in the Lebanese capital Beirut due to recent days of gun battles and shelling.

Secretary-General's spokesman Giuliani said that Pérez de Cuéllar is "saddened by the loss of innocent civilian lives in the escalating conflict in Beirut."

The UN Secretary-General also expressed hope that the Arab League's Lebanon Committee, led by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Saad, would succeed in its upcoming mediation efforts.

UNITED NATIONS, March 28 (Xinhua) — The Arab League today called for a ceasefire among the warring factions in Lebanon to facilitate the election of a new central government and restore peace in this war-torn country.

Arab League Permanent Observer to the United Nations, Clovis Maksoud, said at a press conference that the Arab League is "deeply concerned" about the escalation of fighting in Lebanon and the loss of innocent civilian lives.

He pointed out that Israel's continued occupation of southern Lebanon and disregard for relevant UN resolutions are the root causes of the deteriorating situation in Lebanon.

    新华社贝鲁特３月２８日电  黎巴嫩基督教军政府的军队同叙利亚军队及黎巴嫩穆斯林民兵在贝鲁特的战斗２７日进一步恶化。
