A few years ago, some places in Jiangsu Province proposed the idea of "the people's education, the people manage, manage well for the people," which is now gradually being recognized and accepted by the entire province and has turned into action.

In recent years, Jiangsu Province has been increasing its funding for the development of basic education year by year. In 1988, the province allocated 2.12 billion yuan for basic education development, an increase of 26.8% over 1987. Of the newly added 450 million yuan, fiscal allocations and funds raised from various social channels were almost equal. This year, to ensure a significant increase in social investment for the development of the education cause, Jiangsu Province stipulates that, in addition to ensuring that fiscal allocations at all levels achieve "three increases and one priority," efforts must be made to improve the collection of education surcharges in urban and rural areas. In rural areas, for those borne by township and village enterprises or cooperative economic organizations, the collection rate should be equivalent to 1.5% to 2% of the local per capita social net income; for those borne directly by farmers, the collection rate should be equivalent to 1% to 1.5% of the per capita social net income, with households having a per capita income of 300 yuan or less exempted. In cities, the collection ratio of education surcharges can be raised to no less than 2% of the product tax, value-added tax, and business tax. Localities can also prioritize 10% from the urban maintenance and construction fee to improve the conditions of primary and secondary schools.

Due to the multi-channel fundraising and increased educational investment, Jiangsu's primary and secondary schools have spent 1.2 billion yuan in the past decade on rural primary and secondary schools, building and renovating 16 million square meters of school buildings, and the "three mud schools" have basically disappeared. Out of the 2,000 townships in the province, 1,670 have newly built junior high school experimental centers. The structure of secondary education has been reasonably adjusted, and secondary vocational and technical education has developed rapidly. Local higher education and adult education have also seen significant development.

　　增加拨款　多方集资
    江苏全民办教育
    据新华社南京３月１０日电  （《中国教育报》记者杨建业、新华社记者牟维旭）几年前江苏省一些地方提出的“人民教育人民办，办好教育为人民”的思想，如今已逐渐被全省上下所认识和接受，并变成行动。
    近几年来，江苏省用于发展基础教育的经费逐年增加。１９８８年全省用于发展基础教育的经费共２１．２亿元，比１９８７年增长２６．８％。在新增加的４．５亿元中，财政拨款与多渠道从社会上筹措的资金几乎平分秋色。今年，为了保证发展教育事业的社会投入有较大幅度增加，江苏省规定，除各级财政拨款必须切实做到“三增长、一优先”外，要进一步搞好城乡教育费附加的征收工作。在农村，凡由乡村企业或合作经济组织负担的，其征收率应相当于当地农民人均社会纯收入的１．５％到２％；凡由农民直接负担的，其征收率应相当于农民人均社会纯收入的１％到１．５％，人均收入３００元以下的农户免征。在城市，教育费附加的征收比例可提高到不低于产品税、增值税和营业税的２％。各地还可以从城市维护建设费中优先提取１０％用于改善中小学办学条件。
    由于多渠道筹措资金，增加教育投入，江苏各地中小学近１０年用于农村中小学的经费达１２亿元，新建和修建校舍１６００万平方米，“三泥学校”已基本消失。全省２０００个乡镇中已有１６７０个新建了初中实验中心。中等教育结构得到合理调整，中等职业技术教育发展很快。地方高等教育和成人教育也得到较大发展。
