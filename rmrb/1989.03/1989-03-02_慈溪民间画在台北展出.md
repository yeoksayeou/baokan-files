30 pieces of folk art from Cixi, Zhejiang, were exhibited last month at the Fengming Art Gallery in Taipei, Taiwan. This marks the first time that folk art from a county-level (or city-level) area in mainland China has been exhibited in Taiwan.

The folk art from Cixi City, which vividly depicts the local customs and rural atmosphere of southern Jiangnan, has gained some recognition both domestically and internationally. It participated in the first National Art Festival last year. In recent years, it has also been showcased in the United States, Japan, East Germany, Australia, Hong Kong, and other countries and regions.

    慈溪民间画在台北展出
    30幅浙江慈溪民间画上月在台湾省台北市凤鸣画廊展出。这是大陆县（市）级民间画首次在台湾展出。
    表现江南民间风土人情，乡土气息浓郁的慈溪市民间画在国内外有一定影响，去年，曾在全国首届艺术节参展。近年先后在美国、日本、民主德国、澳大利亚、香港等国家和地区展出。
