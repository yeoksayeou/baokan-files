Three lawyers from Taian County, Liaoning Province, were accused of "aiding and abetting" for performing their legal duty of defending clients and were detained twice, wrongfully imprisoned for four years. This wrongful case has finally been rectified. This is the result of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee supervising the law enforcement agencies according to the law.

The appearance of people's lawyers in the court to participate in the defense is an important part of the criminal procedure. An important content of strengthening socialist democracy and legal system construction is to improve the lawyer system. To maintain and respect the lawyers' right to defend is beneficial to the development of socialist democracy and to the maintenance of the dignity of the Constitution and laws.

In the defense activities in the court, people's lawyers, based on facts and in accordance with the law, present materials and opinions to prove the innocence of the defendant, or to reduce or exempt the defendant's criminal responsibility, and to protect the defendant's legal rights. Lawyers performing their defense duties help the people's courts to fully understand the case and correctly apply the law, thus making a legal and just judgment. Throughout the trial process, the tasks of lawyers and prosecutors and judges are parallel and not contradictory. Therefore, in the trial activities, prosecutors and judges must seriously listen to the lawyers' defense opinions and respect the lawyers' right to defend.

In the past decade, with the gradual improvement of socialist democracy and legal system in our country and the rapid development of economic construction, the role of lawyers has become increasingly prominent, and the work of lawyers has been increasingly respected and supported by all sides. However, in some regions and departments, some judicial personnel or leading comrades have weak legal awareness, ignore the importance of lawyers' work, and even mistakenly believe that lawyers defending the accused are "opposing the prosecutors," "losing their stance," and "aiding and abetting criminals." Some people blame the problem of once ineffective crackdown on criminal activities on the lawyers' defense. With these wrong understandings, it is inevitable that incidents of detaining defense lawyers on charges of "aiding and abetting" will occur. The wrong case that happened in Anshan City has had a very bad influence in society.

Since the restoration of the lawyer system in our country, the number of people engaged in the lawyer profession has rapidly increased. However, the overall quality of this team still cannot meet the needs of today's legal system construction. It is inevitable that some of them will have deviations or even errors in their defense activities. The correct attitude towards these problems should be to maintain and respect the lawyers' right to defend while giving them enthusiastic help, so that they can gradually improve their political and professional level, and promote the perfection of the lawyer system.

Although this wrong case has been rectified, what caused this wrong case that should not have happened? And what caused the delay in rectifying it? Obviously, it is worth the Anshan Municipal People's Procuratorate to reflect on this, so as to seriously draw lessons from this incident, while seriously dealing with the relevant responsible persons, strengthen the study of the Constitution and laws, and continuously enhance the awareness of the rule of law.

At present, in the main aspects of political life and social life in our country, the situation of having no law to depend on has basically changed. However, people have strong opinions about the phenomenon of having laws but not following them, enforcing laws but not strictly, and violating laws but not investigating them in some regions. Under this situation, it is very necessary for the people's congresses at all levels and their standing committees to seriously perform the supervisory functions entrusted by the Constitution. In strengthening and improving the socialist democracy and legal system construction in our country, the people's congresses at all levels and their standing committees can do a lot.

### 律师辩护权不容侵犯

　　律师辩护权不容侵犯
    辽宁省台安县三位律师因依法履行辩护职责反被指控犯有“包庇罪”，两次遭逮捕、蒙冤达四年。这桩不该发生的错案终于得以纠正。这是全国人大及其常委会对执法机关依法实施监督的结果。
    人民律师出现在法庭上，参与辩护，是刑事诉讼程序中的重要环节。加强社会主义民主和法制建设的一项重要内容，就是健全律师制度。维护和尊重律师的辩护权，有利于发扬社会主义民主，有利于维护宪法和法律的尊严。
    在法庭的辩护活动中，人民律师以事实为根据，以法律为准绳，提出证明被告人无罪、罪轻或者减轻、免除其刑事责任的材料和意见，维护被告人的合法权益，是他们的职责。律师履行辩护职责，有助于人民法院更全面地查明案情，正确地适用法律，从而做出合法的公正判决。整个诉讼过程中，律师同公诉人员和审判人员的任务是并行不悖的。因此，审判活动中，公诉人员和审判人员必须认真听取律师的辩护意见，尊重律师的辩护权。
    近十年来，随着我国社会主义民主与法制的逐步健全，随着经济建设的迅速发展，律师的作用越来越明显，律师工作也越来越受到各方面的尊重和支持。但是，在一些地区和部门，有的司法人员或领导同志，法制观念淡薄，无视律师工作的重要性，甚至错误地认为，律师为被告人辩护是与公诉人员唱对台戏，是“丧失立场”、“包庇罪犯”，有的把一度存在的对刑事犯罪分子打击不力的问题，也归罪于律师的辩护。存在着这些错误认识，就难免不发生以“包庇罪”逮捕辩护律师的事件。发生在鞍山市的这桩错案，在社会上造成了很坏的影响。
    我国律师制度自恢复以来，从事律师工作的人员迅速增加，但这支队伍的素质，从总体上说，还不能适应当今法制建设的需要。他们中有些人在辩护活动中出现这样或那样的偏差甚至错误，在所难免。对待这些问题的正确态度应当是在维护和尊重律师辩护权的同时，给他们以热情帮助，使他们逐步提高政治和业务水平，促使律师制度日臻完善。
    这桩错案虽然纠正了，但是，是什么原因造成这桩不该发生的错案？又是什么原因迟迟得不到纠正？显然值得鞍山市人民检察院作一番反思，以便从这次事件中认真吸取教训，在严肃认真地处理有关责任者的同时，加强对宪法和法律的学习，不断增强法制观念。
    目前，我国在政治生活和社会生活的主要方面，已基本改变了无法可依的状况。但是，人们对一些地区存在的有法不依、执法不严、违法不究的现象很有意见。这种情况下，很需要各级人民代表大会及其常务委员会认真履行宪法赋予的监督职能。在加强和健全我国的社会主义民主和法制建设方面，各级人民代表大会及其常务委员会可以大有作为。
