Edition: 3

The delegates, after listening to the government work report, conducted a serious and thorough discussion. Meanwhile, many delegates also submitted written suggestions, criticisms, and opinions. For example, some delegates suggested enacting a banking law to stabilize the financial system and control prices; enacting a fixed asset investment law to strengthen the management of construction scale; establishing rules for reviewing national economic and social development plans to enhance the macro-decision-making and supervisory capabilities of state power organs; suggesting reforming the supervision mechanism to strengthen anti-corruption efforts; suggesting establishing a "People's Representative Forum" in news media, etc. All of these reflect the delegates' attention to major national issues.

Below are selected suggestions, criticisms, and opinions from the delegates.

	Suggestion to Amend the "Price Management Regulations"

Lake South Province delegate Zhang Xia proposed that, based on the new situations and problems that have emerged, the "Price Management Regulations" should be amended and improved in the following aspects: First, the "Price Management Regulations" clearly stipulate three types of pricing: state-set prices, state-guided prices, and market-adjusted prices. However, in practice, state-set prices are insignificant, and the number of state-set price items is very few. Local pricing authority is even smaller. Due to the lack of pricing authority, it is difficult to grasp the legal supervision standards. Second, the "Price Management Regulations" stipulate that reasonable purchase-sale price differences, wholesale-retail price differences, and regional price differences are allowed. Later, the State Price Bureau issued a document to control the price differences of liberalized price items, which led to contradictions and chaos in the implementation of the "Price Management Regulations." Third, currently, many provinces and cities have two prices for certain commodities within and outside the province, forming the phenomenon of "commodity tourism" and the chaotic situation of "buying tickets on the spot" in recent years, which also provides opportunities for officials and illegal elements to take advantage of. These problems are difficult to solve with the "Price Management Regulations." Fourth, the "Price Management Regulations" only stipulate the authority to issue fines for price supervision and inspection, making it difficult to truly and effectively stop various price-related illegal behaviors, especially for the illegal behaviors of individual business owners, the price departments are powerless.

	Suggestions on Anti-Corruption Construction

Hunan delegates Peng Renjie and two others proposed: Over the past year, China's anti-corruption efforts have achieved some successes, but the current anti-corruption measures are not enough to fundamentally eliminate the existence and spread of corruption. Although the number of personnel in the discipline inspection, supervision, audit, and procuratorate teams has been increasing year by year, and the number of institutions has been increasing year by year, there are still many problems with party and government conduct. The main reason is that the current supervision system is not entirely scientific, mainly manifested in three aspects: First, the supervision departments are led by the supervised objects, which weakens the function of supervision. Second, the supervision functions are chaotic. For the same case, such as economic issues, it can be a matter for the audit, or it can be a matter for the supervision, and it can also be a matter for the discipline inspection and the procuratorate. Everyone can initiate a case for investigation and handling, but when encountering a difficult object, they can also shift the responsibility to each other, resulting in the phenomena of "having laws but not enforcing them" and "enforcing laws but not strictly" occurring from time to time. Third, there is a lack of strong and effective supervision over administrative leaders at all levels. It is suggested to transform the current relatively weak internal supervision system into a strong external supervision system. Therefore, it is suggested to transfer the institutions and personnel of the administrative audit part of the supervision department and audit department under the government to the same-level People's Congress, and let the People's Congress directly supervise the government, forming a rigorous democratic supervision system with the "power supervision" of the People's Congress as the center and mass supervision as the foundation, to ensure the cleanliness of the organs.

	Suggestion to Establish a "People's Representative Forum" in News Media

Guangxi delegate Li Guoyun proposed: Currently, there are 40 million representatives at all levels of people's congresses in China, who should become the bridge between the government and the people. Except during the congress sessions, representatives have few opportunities to reflect the people's demands and criticize government work. To improve the ability of the broad masses of representatives to participate in politics, it is suggested to establish a "People's Representative Forum" or "special program" in various news media (newspapers, television, radio, etc.) in China to publish the political views of the broad masses of representatives, which is beneficial to the development of democracy in China.

	Suggestion to Have Major Construction Projects Approved by People's Congresses at All Levels

Guizhou delegate Wang Lusheng proposed: The waste in economic construction is shocking, and some are even called "tuition fees." The so-called "connection projects" and "leader projects" can be found from top to bottom, and they are rampant and cannot be stopped. Scientific decision-making and democratic decision-making are not forthcoming, and precious construction funds are arbitrarily disposed of, which is heartbreaking. It is suggested that major construction projects arranged by the central government be classified into levels according to the size of the investment (considering the nature of the project) and be reviewed and approved by the National People's Congress, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the specialized committees. Only projects that have passed the review can obtain the qualification for planning items. The same should be done at the provincial, municipal, and county levels.

	Suggestion for the People's Congress to Participate in the Inspection of Construction Investment

Jiangsu Province delegate Weng Xinhe proposed: The high speed of economic development is an important reason for social disorder. "High speed, high indicators" have been wrong tendencies that have occurred many times since the founding of the country. Compressing basic construction is emphasized every year, but it has never been compressed down. This point should be borne by the State Council, and it should not just call for it every year. In addition to calling for it, the approval system should be strictly implemented. The National Development and Reform Commission has the power to approve, and it should do a good job. Our country has many regulations on the approval of construction projects, design standards, budget estimates, and final accounts, and it is not that there are no laws to follow. However, personal relationships replace legislation, and the will of superiors, acquaintances' recommendations, and internal connections are more useful. The National Development and Reform Commission should first set an example, and then the local development and reform commissions should do a good job at their own checkpoints, clarify responsibilities, and if a department cannot control it, the person in charge of that department should resign. Who approves the project should be responsible for it, and after the completion of the project, if the effect is not achieved, if there is a lack of water, electricity, raw materials, and sales channels, the approver should be responsible, and the root cause should be investigated to the end, and it should not be dealt with carelessly. It is suggested that the National People's Congress require the State Council to report every year whether the construction investment has been implemented, and other people's congresses at all levels should also inspect construction projects.

　　多出主意　多想办法        
    ——来自七届全国人大代表的建议、批评和意见
    代表们在听了政府工作报告后，进行了严肃而认真的审议。同时，许多代表还通过书面形式提出了建议、批评和意见。例如有的代表建议制定银行法，以稳定金融，平抑物价；制定固定资产投资法，以加强对基建规模的管理；制定国民经济和社会发展计划审查规则，以加强国家权力机关的宏观决策和监督工作的能力；建议通过改革监督机制，加强廉政建设；建议在新闻媒介中设立人民代表论坛等等。这些都表明了代表对国家的重大问题的关注。
    下面是代表建议、批评和意见选登。
    　　　　建议修改《价格管理条例》
    湖南省代表张霞提出，要根据目前出现的新情况、新问题，修改《价格管理条例》，建议针对以下方面进行修改、完善：一、《价格管理条例》中明确规定了国家定价、国家指导价和市场调节价三种价格形式，但在实践中，国家定价部分无足轻重，定价的商品极少，地方定价权更小，由于缺乏定价权，依法监督的标准难掌握。二、《价格管理条例》中规定：允许合理的购销差价、批零差价、地区差价，后来，国家物价局又发文对放开价格商品的差率进行控制，引发了《价格管理条例》执行中的矛盾和混乱。三、目前不少省、地出现某些商品省内省外两个价，形成“商品旅游，价格滚雪球”的怪现象和近年的“坐地买票”的混乱局面，也给官倒私倒，不法分子以可乘之机，这些问题，《价格管理条例》都难以解决。四、《价格管理条例》中关于物价监督检查的手段只规定了划款权限，难以真正有效地制止各种价格违法行为，特别对个体户的违法行为物价部门无能为力。
    　　　　关于廉政建设的建议
    湖南代表彭仁阶等三人提出：一年多来，我国的廉政建设虽然取得了不少成绩，但是，现在的廉政措施，还不足以从根本上消除腐败现象的存在和蔓延，尽管纪检、监察、审计、检察队伍的人员逐年增加，机构逐年增多，但是党风、政风却有不少问题，究其原因，重要的一条就是现行的监督体系不尽科学，主要表现在三个方面：一是监督部门受监督对象的领导，使监督的功能软化。二是监督职能混乱。同一案件，例如经济问题，可以是审计的事，也可以是监察的事，同样可能是纪委和检察的事，大家都可以立案查处，但碰到棘手的对象也可以互相推诿，以致“有法不依”和“执法不严”的现象时有发生。三是对各级行政领导缺乏应有的强有力的监督。建议把现有的比较软弱的内部监督体系改造成为强有力的外部监督体系。因此建议：把现在归属于政府的监察部门、审计部门中的行政审计部分的机构和人员转交给同级人民代表大会，由人大直接实行对政府的监督，形成以人大的“权力监督”为中心，群众监督为基础的严谨的民主监督体制，确保机关廉洁。
    　　　　建议在新闻媒介中
    　　　　设立人民代表论坛
    广西代表李国运提出：我国现有各级人代会代表４００万人，他们应当成为政府与人民之间联系的桥梁。现除代表会期间，代表有机会反映人民的要求，批评政府工作外，其他时间机会甚少。为了提高广大人民代表参政议政的能力，建议在我国各种新闻媒介（报纸、电视、广播等）中设立“人民代表论坛”或“专题节目”，发表广大人民代表的政见，有利于我国民主建设。
    　　　　建议重大建设项目交由
    　　　　各级人代会审议通过
    贵州代表王录生提出：经济建设中大量浪费，触目惊心，有的还美其名曰“交学费”。所谓“条子工程”、“首长工程”，从上到下，随处可遇，而且屡禁不止。科学决策、民主决策呼之不出，宝贵的建设资金被任意支配，令人心痛。建议：中央一级安排的重大建设项目，按投资数额的大小（考虑工程的性质）分成等级，分别交由全国人民代表大会、人大常委会、专门委员会进行审议。只有通过审议的项目，才取得计划列项的资格。省地县各级也照此办理。
    　　　　建议人大参与检查基建投资
    江苏省代表翁心鹤提出：经济发展速度过高是社会秩序紊乱的重要原因之一，“高速度、高指标”是建国以来多次发生的错误倾向。压缩基本建设是每年都强调的，但是始终压不下去。这一点国务院要承担责任，不能年年空口喊叫，除了号召，要严格审批制度。国家计委掌握审批大权，应该把好关。我国基建的立项审批、设计规范、概算、决算的法规制定不少，并非无法可依。但是人情代替立法，长官意志、熟人说项、内部疏通反而更有用。国家计委首先要树立榜样，再是地方计经委把好各自的关口，明确责任，哪个部门管不住，请那里的主管引咎辞职。什么人批的项目要负责到底，完工后效果达不到，缺少水电、无原料、少销路，审批人要负责，追根问底，决不马虎了事。建议全国人大要求国务院报告每年基建投资是否落在实处，其他各级人大都来检查基建项目。
