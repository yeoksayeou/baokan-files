San Salvador, February 28th: The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), a Salvadoran guerrilla group, announced on the 28th that it accepts the government's peace proposal.

The guerrilla organization issued a statement saying that if the government forces agree to a ceasefire and facilitate negotiations, the guerrillas are prepared to hold talks with government and party representatives in El Salvador from March 4th to 5th.

The statement emphasized that the guerrillas agree with President Duarte's idea of holding a citizen's referendum on postponing the presidential election. The statement pointed out that the government must clearly understand that the talks between the guerrillas and the government will primarily discuss postponing the national elections, originally scheduled for March 19th, to September, and stopping repressive actions. Only then will the guerrillas discuss all the issues raised by the government.

The guerrillas' statement said that the talks between the two sides should be "negotiations aimed at reaching a final agreement, rather than just an exchange of views."

On the 26th, Salvadoran President Duarte had stated that if approved by the parliament, the elections could be postponed to April 30th, and a citizen's referendum could be held on this issue. Duarte's proposal was a response to the guerrillas' suggestion to postpone the elections. Duarte said that the government is prepared to start talks with the guerrillas in Guatemala on the 28th while implementing the ceasefire.

According to another report, the Salvadoran military announced on the 28th that to support President Duarte's peace proposal, the government forces will cease military operations for three months starting immediately.

    萨游击队接受和平建议
    尼加拉瓜决定释放1900多名政治犯
    新华社墨西哥城2月28日电　圣萨尔瓦多消息：萨尔瓦多游击队法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线28日宣布接受政府提出的和平建议。
    游击队组织发表的一项公报说，如果政府军接受停火，为谈判提供便利，游击队准备于3月4日至5日同政府和各政党代表在萨尔瓦多举行会谈。
    公报强调，游击队同意杜阿尔特总统关于就推迟总统大选问题举行一次公民投票的想法。公报指出，政府必须明确，游击队和政府举行会谈，将主要讨论把原订3月19日的全国大选推迟到9月份举行和停止镇压行动等问题。只有这样，游击队才将讨论政府提出的所有问题。
    游击队的公报说，双方的会谈应是“为达成最后协议而进行的谈判，而不应只是简单的交换意见”。
    萨尔瓦多总统杜阿尔特26日曾表示，只要得到议会批准，大选可推迟到4月30日举行，并考虑就此问题举行一次公民投票。杜阿尔特的建议是对游击队方面提出的推迟大选建议的答复。杜阿尔特说，政府准备在停火同时，于2月28日开始在危地马拉同游击队对话。
    另据报道，萨尔瓦多军方28日宣布，为支持杜阿尔特总统的和平建议，政府军从即日起停止3个月的军事行动。
    新华社马那瓜2月28日电尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加28日就释放1900多名政治犯问题向国会递交一份法律草案。
    尼加拉瓜政府准备释放的政治犯，大部分是索摩查统治时期的国民警卫队成员。
