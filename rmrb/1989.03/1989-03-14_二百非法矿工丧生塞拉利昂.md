Xinhua News Agency, Dakar, March 12th.

Over 200 illegal miners of various nationalities died last week in a diamond mine collapse in Kotobi village in southern Sierra Leone.

According to tourists returning from the diamond mining area to the capital Freetown, rescue workers have given up hope of finding any survivors by the 12th.

Last December, Kotobi was officially designated as a diamond mining area. News of this spread, attracting thousands of people, particularly from Senegal and Burkina Faso, who rushed to the area to engage in illegal mining.

The accident may have been caused by illegal miners fleeing from police actions to drive them out, leading to vibrations that caused the mine shaft to collapse. The Sierra Leonean authorities have begun investigating this tragedy.

　　二百非法矿工丧生塞拉利昂
    新华社达喀尔三月十二日电  据来自弗里敦的消息，二百多名不同国籍的非法矿工上星期在塞拉利昂南部的科托比村一次钻石矿倒塌事故中丧生。
    据从钻石矿区返回首都弗里敦的旅游者说，救援人员十二日已放弃了寻找生存者的希望。
    去年十二月，科托比被正式宣布为钻石矿区。消息传开后，成千人，特别是塞内加尔和布基纳法索人涌向这里非法开采。
    这次事故可能是在非法采矿者躲避警方采取的驱逐行动，逃跑引起震动，造成坑道塌方而酿成的。塞拉利昂当局已着手调查这起惨案。
