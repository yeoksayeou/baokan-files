Title: An Initial Analysis of the U.S. Trade Situation

In 1988, the United States saw a noticeable improvement in its foreign trade situation. According to a report released by the U.S. Department of Commerce on February 17, the country's trade deficit for the year was $137.3 billion, a reduction of $33 billion from the $170.3 billion deficit in 1987. This marked the first time since 1980 that the annual trade deficit had decreased compared to the previous year.

A closer examination of the current U.S. trade situation reveals several key points. First, in December 1988, both U.S. imports and exports grew, reaching record highs. Second, in December, the export of manufactured goods increased to $19.8 billion, $2.1 billion higher than the monthly average for 1988. However, imports of manufactured goods also surged to $31.9 billion, significantly exceeding the export figure. Third, while U.S.-European trade improved in 1988, the trade situation with Japan showed little improvement, with the trade deficit with Japan accounting for about half of the U.S.'s annual trade deficit. The imbalance in U.S.-Japan trade remains a significant issue in the bilateral relationship.

The improvement in the U.S. trade situation in 1988 came as a surprise to many economists, and the White House was pleased with the development. However, many in the U.S. economic community believe that the country still faces numerous trade issues, and the outlook is not optimistic. First, while the trade deficit decreased in 1988, it remains high in absolute terms, and the trend of running a deficit has not fundamentally changed. Over the past few years, the U.S. has typically reduced its trade deficit by devaluing the dollar. However, the monthly trade figures for 1988 show that U.S. exports fluctuated, and the deficit hovered around $10 billion, indicating that devaluation has not solved the fundamental trade problems.

Second, other methods to expand exports are unlikely to yield quick results. Currently, U.S. exports are relatively low compared to imports. Some economists argue that export growth must be 1.5 times that of imports to control the worsening trade deficit. One analysis suggests that if U.S. exports grow by 12.5% in 1989 and imports grow by no more than 8.5%, the deficit can be kept at the 1988 level, highlighting the difficulty of the problem. Another approach to expanding exports and reducing imports is through international trade negotiations to adjust trade relations. However, this is not something that can be achieved overnight. The new trade law passed by the U.S. Congress in April 1988 aims to pressure U.S. trading partners to open their markets to American goods, which inevitably leads to disputes and conflicts with trading partners. Additionally, reducing the federal budget deficit to decrease domestic demand is another method. Currently, the U.S. government and Congress are negotiating the budget for the next fiscal year (1990), with a key issue being how to reduce the significant budget deficit. This is no easy task. Even if the 1990 budget deficit is reduced to the legal limit of $100 billion, the absolute figure remains substantial. Moreover, reducing domestic demand involves other economic issues, making it even more challenging.

　　美国外贸形势初析
    本报记者  张启昕
    １９８８年，美国的对外贸易状况有明显的改善。根据２月１７日美国商务部的报告，去年美国贸易逆差为１３７３亿美元，比１９８７年的１７０３亿美元减少３３０亿。这是自１９８０年以来，全年外贸赤字第一次比上个年度减少。
    如果进一步分析美国当前的外贸形势，大致可以看出以下一些特点：第一，１９８８年１２月美国外贸的进出口均有增长，而且都达创纪录水平；第二，１２月份的进出口商品中，制造业产品的出口增加，达１９８亿美元，比１９８８年月平均水平高出２１亿美元，但是，进口的制造业产品也大幅度上升，达３１９亿美元，大大超过出口额；第三，１９８８年的美欧贸易有了改善，但美国对日本的贸易状况改善不大，对日逆差仍占美国全年外贸逆差的一半左右。美日贸易不平衡仍是两国关系中的一大隐患。
    美国１９８８年外贸形势的好转，出乎许多经济界人士的预料，白宫也为之高兴。但美国经济界不少人士认为，美国外贸方面的问题不少，前景并不乐观。首先从去年外贸形势看，外贸赤字虽然减少，但只是同１９８７年相比而言，其绝对数额仍然很高，入超的趋势并未根本扭转。在过去几年里，美国缩小贸易逆差，通常采取的办法是使美元贬值。但１９８８年各月的外贸情况表明，美国出口幅度时升时降，逆差时低时高，始终保持在每月逆差１００亿美元上下的水平，可见，美元贬值并没有解决贸易的根本问题。
    其次，扩大出口的其他办法也难很快见效。美国外贸目前的现状是，出口额相对来说比进口额小，有的经济学家认为，出口增长的幅度必须比进口大１．５倍，才能制住美国外贸逆差的恶化。有的材料分析，１９８９年美国的出口如能增长１２.５％，而进口增长不超过８.５％，才能把逆差限制在１９８８年的水平上，足见问题之困难。当前扩大出口、减少进口还能采用另外一个办法，即通过国际贸易谈判，调整贸易关系。但这并不是一下子就能办到的。１９８８年４月美国国会通过的新贸易法，企图迫使美国的贸易伙伴对美货开放市场，这就难免造成美国与贸易伙伴之间的争吵和冲突。再就是降低联邦预算赤字，减少国内需求。目前美国政府和国会正在为下年度（１９９０财政年度）的预算进行磋商，中心议题是如何把巨额财政赤字降下来，难度不小。但即使把１９９０年的财政赤字降到１０００亿美元的法定水平，其绝对数仍相当可观。而且要减少国内需求，还牵涉国内经济的其他问题，谈何容易。
