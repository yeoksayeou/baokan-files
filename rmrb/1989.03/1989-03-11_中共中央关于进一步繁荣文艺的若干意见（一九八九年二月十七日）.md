Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, China's literature and art have entered a new era of prosperity and vitality. With the vigorous development of socialist modernization and the deepening of reform and opening up, the literature and art sector faces new situations and tasks. It is of great significance to earnestly implement the basic line of the Party in the primary stage of socialism, to summarize the historical experience since the founding of the People's Republic, especially the experience of the past decade, to improve and strengthen the Party's leadership over the literature and art sector, and to adhere to the policy of long-term and stable development of literature and art. This will help consolidate and develop a political situation of stability, unity, democracy, and harmony, promote the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization, and further prosper socialist literature and art.

I. Correctly Assess the Current Situation of Literature and Art

(1) Over the past decade, China's literature and art have undergone historic changes. The main features of these changes are: the majority of literature and art workers have broken free from the long-standing "leftist" shackles of the "class struggle as the key link" after the basic completion of socialist transformation, have broken through the narrow understanding of the functions of literature and art, have achieved significant liberation of thought, have gained considerable freedom in creation, and have a completely new spiritual outlook. Literary and artistic works have not only increased in quantity to an unprecedented level but have also made significant progress in reflecting social life in terms of breadth and depth. They have played an important role in promoting the emancipation of thought, inspiring people to engage in socialist modernization, adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, and enriching the spiritual and cultural life of the people. While carrying forward the excellent national cultural traditions, many literary and artistic works have actively absorbed beneficial foreign cultures, achieving new breakthroughs in art, and presenting a thriving scene of diversity in content, themes, forms, and styles. Literary criticism and theoretical research in literature and art have gradually become active, and literary and artistic concepts have been updated and developed. Mass cultural activities have become increasingly widespread and vigorous. New literary and artistic practices have nurtured new literary and artistic talents, and a large number of outstanding young artists have emerged, bringing vitality and energy to the literary and artistic circles. A socialist literary and artistic team, composed of the old, middle-aged, and young, and welcomed and trusted by the people, is gradually growing and strengthening. It can be said that these ten years have been a period of active thought, abundant achievements, and the emergence of talents in the literary and artistic circles.

(2) The good situation in the literary and artistic circles comes from the deep implementation of the line since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, from the inspiration and promotion of the situation of reform and opening up, from the rectification and major adjustments of the Party's policies and principles in the literary and artistic circles over the past ten years, and from the creative labor of the broad masses of literary and artistic workers. After the end of the ten years of turmoil, the Party organizations have rectified the wrong cases of a large number of literary and artistic workers, restored the reputation of a large number of excellent literary and artistic works that were defamed; according to the changes in the objective situation, the slogan of "literature and art serving politics" is no longer put forward, and "serving the people and serving socialism" is taken as the direction of literary and artistic work; the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is reaffirmed, and a series of policies aimed at liberating the productive forces of literature and art are formulated; at the same time, the Party has also appropriately criticized and guided some negative phenomena that have appeared in the literary and artistic circles. The Party's transformation in guiding ideology and leadership methods has inspired the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of literary and artistic workers, creating a favorable environment and atmosphere for them to engage in literary and artistic creation with a relaxed mind.

(3) The main problems in the current literary and artistic work are: the leadership of literature and art and the literary and artistic system do not fully adapt to the new situation, and the economic policies related to literature and art under the conditions of socialist commodity economy are not yet perfect; there are not enough outstanding literary and artistic works that deeply reflect social changes and the spirit of the times, and some works that are negative, vulgar, demoralizing, and have adverse effects on society have emerged; scientific and realistic literary criticism has not been carried out frequently and actively; some comrades in the literary and artistic team lack understanding of the history and culture of the motherland, lack the spirit of diligent study of professional basic skills; some comrades lack a sense of social responsibility and have varying degrees of detachment from reality. Therefore, further emancipating the mind, strengthening the consciousness of construction, enhancing unity, prospering creation, and strengthening theoretical research have become urgent tasks for literary and artistic work in the new situation.

(4) In the process of reform and opening up and the development of socialist commodity economy, social phenomena are complex, and people's thoughts, concepts, and aesthetic habits are undergoing great changes, which cannot but reflect on the understanding of literary and artistic issues. Therefore, the situation in the literary and artistic circles must be objectively and dialectically analyzed in the process of development, and it is absolutely not allowed to be simplified. It is necessary to prevent only seeing the good side and not facing the problems that must be solved; it is also necessary to prevent exaggerating the shortcomings and using old ideas and old methods to observe and solve new problems.

II. Adhere to the "Two Serves" Direction and the "Hundred Flowers" Policy

(1) Adhering to the direction of "serving the people and serving socialism" and the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" is the fundamental guarantee for the long-term and stable development of China's socialist literature and art. Socialist literature and art are an important part of the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. By giving full play to the various functions of literature and art, we can invigorate the national spirit, improve the quality of the people, enlighten people's wisdom, beautify people's minds, and continuously meet the diverse and multi-level needs of the broad masses for cultural life. We should educate, influence, and inspire the people, promote social progress. Our literature and art should uphold the banner of patriotism and socialism, promote socialist humanism, and strive unremittingly for the Four Modernizations and the rejuvenation of China. We should advocate all excellent works that are conducive to socialist modernization and comprehensive reform, advocate all excellent works that are conducive to inspiring people to strive for progress, innovation, and active progress, and advocate all excellent works that are conducive to cultivating people's moral sentiments. This should be the main theme of China's literary and artistic creation. We need both the enthusiastic praise of revolution and construction and everything beautiful, and the lashing out at ugliness and decay. The purpose and tone should be to enhance the national self-confidence and strengthen the national cohesion, promoting the development of socialist construction and reform and opening up. As long as it does not violate the Constitution, laws, and relevant state regulations, all works that are harmless in thought and acceptable in art and can give people artistic enjoyment and entertainment are allowed to exist.

Our literary and artistic workers should inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of Chinese revolutionary literature and art, correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the state and society, and put the interests of the state and the people first. They should follow the laws of historical development, recognize their sacred mission in the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, fully exert their creative abilities, and make due contributions to helping people, especially the younger generation, become a new generation with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline.

(2) Literary and artistic creation, as a special kind of spiritual labor, particularly requires the exertion of individual creativity. It is necessary to further create a stable, united, democratic, and harmonious social environment for artists to concentrate on creation. What to write and how to write should be freely decided by the artists. It is necessary to truly guarantee the freedom of creation and criticism, encourage creativity, advocate free competition among different styles, schools, and sects, and advocate scientific and realistic criticism and counter-criticism. Problems in literary and artistic creation should be discussed, studied, and explored by the artists themselves, and gradually solved in artistic practice. Party organizations and government agencies should not interfere.

The freedom of creation is our Party's long-standing correct proposition, which is protected and constrained by the Constitution and laws. It is not allowed to regard the freedom of creation as bourgeois liberalization, to see some problems in creation and negate and cancel it, nor is it allowed to regard it as the cancellation of the social significance and social responsibility of literature and art.

(3) Literature and art are basically a social and cultural phenomenon. Literature and art are not the same as politics and cannot be subordinated to politics, let alone be subordinated to temporary, specific, and direct political tasks. However, literature and art cannot be separated from politics. It should be seen that some literary and artistic works have a great influence on people's ideological and political aspects, but their influence should not be exaggerated.

(4) It is necessary to correctly understand and handle the relationship between carrying forward national cultural traditions and absorbing foreign cultures. The development of socialist literature and art requires the protection and inheritance of the excellent cultural heritage of all ethnic groups in China, as well as the learning from the excellent cultural achievements of foreign countries. For the traditional culture of China, it is not allowed to adopt a contemptuous and negative attitude, and it is necessary to adhere to the policy of critical inheritance, taking the essence and discarding the dross; for foreign culture, it is necessary to adhere to the policy of opening up, absorbing all beneficial things, and rejecting all ugly and decadent things. It is necessary to overcome and resist the influence of feudal and capitalist decadent ideology and morality. On the basis of inheriting the fine cultural traditions of the Chinese nation, it is necessary to select and absorb the excellent cultures of various countries in the world, and create a brilliant new culture of the Chinese nation with the spirit of the times.

(5) Socialist literature and art is the unity of political directionality and the diversity of content, form, style, and school. Our artists should be consistent in the fundamental direction of "serving the people and serving socialism" and in the fundamental task of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and maintaining national unity. We should fully and correctly understand the relationship between the "Two Serves" and the "Hundred Flowers." Without the "Two Serves," the "Hundred Flowers" would lose its direction; without the "Hundred Flowers," the "Two Serves" could not be realized. The two are unified and inseparable and should not be regarded as mutually opposed and mutually exclusive.

III. Strive to Improve and Strengthen the Party's Leadership over the Literature and Art Sector

(1) The Party's leadership over the literature and art sector is the leadership of political principles and political direction. This mainly refers to formulating and adjusting the principles and policies of literature and art, doing a good job in ideological and political work, ensuring that literature and art develop in the correct direction; through the guarantee and supervision of Party organizations and the vanguard and exemplary role of Party members to carry out work; according to the standard of both virtue and ability, recommend important cadre candidates to the literature and art departments, and strengthen the construction of the leading cadre team. The Party cannot replace the government agencies in managing the functions of literature and art, nor can it take charge of the activities of mass literary and artistic organizations. If the Party's leading organs deviate from the above principles, interfere too much and too specifically in other aspects of the literature and art sector, it will restrict the creative play of literary and artistic organizations and artists, and also make themselves bogged down in specific affairs, affecting political leadership, and it is not conducive to playing a macro-regulatory and guiding role in the literary and artistic circles.

(2) The Party's leading organs should fully respect the characteristics and laws of literature and art, and intervene and interfere less in specific literary and artistic works and academic issues. The quality of literary and artistic works should be judged by the broad readers, audiences, and the literary and artistic circles themselves, and should be tested by history. Some literary and artistic issues are difficult to distinguish right from wrong at the moment, and it is allowed to discuss them at leisure without rushing to conclusions. Some do not need to make a unified conclusion. Except for those that violate the Constitution and laws and must be prohibited, general academic and artistic issues should not be solved by administrative orders, but only by democratic and equal discussions. It is necessary to advocate correct and good things through active and healthy criticism, criticize and oppose incorrect and bad things, and promote the development of academic and artistic pursuits. In literary and artistic and academic discussions, the principle of equal opportunities for all parties involved in debates and competitions should be implemented; newspapers and periodicals as commentary platforms should not only publish one kind of opinion they appreciate but also refuse to publish another different opinion, especially to prevent unhealthy trends and emotions from monopolizing the commentary platform. For artists and their works, it is necessary to adhere to the specific analysis of specific problems, not to generalize everything or negate everything. It is necessary to prevent taking administrative measures against the entire literary and artistic circles or a certain literary and artistic department due to the errors of individual works or individuals.

(3) Leaders should correctly implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, and strive to explore and study the ways and methods of leading the literary and artistic work well under the new historical conditions. They should respect, understand, and care for the broad masses of literary and artistic workers, strengthen exchanges and dialogues with them, so that the literary and artistic circles understand the efforts of the Party to realize the Four Modernizations and the rejuvenation of China, the work being carried out, the problems faced, and the solutions. The personal opinions of leaders as readers or audiences on literary and artistic works should not be regarded as instructions that must be implemented by literary and artistic workers.

To ensure the long-term and stable development of China's literature and art sector, it is necessary to safeguard all the rights of artists and literary and artistic organizations granted by the Constitution and laws, and to further establish and improve various regulations in the literary and artistic sector. For works that must be prohibited due to violations of the law, they should be handled by judicial organs or the government and its authorized departments in accordance with the law or relevant regulations.

IV. Accelerate and Deepen the Reform of the Literary and Art System

(1) The purpose of the reform of the literary and art system is to further develop the productive forces of literature and art, prosper socialist literature and art, and meet the growing cultural life needs of the Chinese people. In recent years, the reform of the literary and art system has achieved some results in the aspects of rationalizing relations, transforming functions, adjusting layouts, and improving management, but the steps are not big. The situation of disordered relations, low efficiency, and overly centralized management has not been fundamentally changed, and it is necessary to accelerate the reform.

(2) The reform of the literary and art system should first rationalize the relations between the Party, the government, and mass literary and artistic organizations, and clarify their respective functions. The Party should implement political leadership and strengthen the macro-guidance of literature and art. The government should mainly guide, plan, coordinate, serve, supervise, and manage the literary and art sector through legal, administrative, economic, and other means. The main function of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles is to be responsible for the liaison, coordination, and service of the members of various organizations, and the association, in addition to the above functions, is also responsible for doing a good job in criticism, publishing periodicals, and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the members. The Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Association should closely contact the masses, improve the mechanism, and become a true representative of the artists, a bridge and channel for communication and dialogue between the Party, the government, various sectors of society, and the literary and artistic circles and artists.

(3) In the management system of literature and art, it is necessary to expand the autonomy of various literary and art units, introduce the competition mechanism, promote the flow of talents, and enhance the vitality and dynamism of literary and art units, and stimulate the enthusiasm and creativity of literary and artistic workers. The reform of the literary and art management system is a systematic project, and it is necessary to study and formulate supporting reform measures. It is necessary to actively and cautiously promote the "dual-track system" in the performing arts troupes: the state-owned performing arts troupes should be fewer but better, representing the national and local artistic level or having special historical preservation value, and be run by the cultural administrative departments of the government; non-state-owned performing arts troupes should be freely organized by artists, implementing collective ownership or individual ownership, self-management, independent accounting, and self-balancing profits and losses. The state should put forward different requirements for performing arts troupes of different ownerships, formulate different management methods, prevent the state-owned performing arts troupes from appearing new phenomena of "eating from the big pot" and "holding the iron rice bowl," and also make the non-state-owned performing arts troupes get the due support.

(4) Establish and improve the socialist cultural market, and correctly guide the cultural consumption of the masses. At present, a cultural market that provides spiritual products and cultural entertainment services to people in the form of commodities is taking shape in China. The government implements macro-control and indirect leadership over the cultural market, using the market mechanism to organize and guide the cultural consumption of the masses, which is one of the ways to improve the quality of spiritual products and services. Our literary and artistic work must take social benefits as the highest standard. It is necessary to strive to improve the quality of spiritual products, improve business management, and improve economic benefits, so that social benefits and economic benefits can be well combined.

(5) Formulate and improve various economic policies in the literature and art sector. The production of spiritual products is different from the production of material products, and the state should give tax concessions to the literature and art sector and appropriately relax the price policy. It is necessary to encourage and support the production of excellent spiritual products, restrict the production of inferior spiritual products, and guide the healthy development of the literature and art sector. In the old, young, border, and poor areas, the literature and art sector is relatively backward, and the state should give more support and help.

V. Strengthen the Self-Construction of the Literary and Art Team

(1) The prosperity of socialist literature and art requires our literary and artistic workers to strive to improve their ideological and professional qualities. It is necessary to advocate that artists strive to learn Marxism, learn the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, learn literary and artistic theories and scientific and cultural knowledge, go to the practice of reform and construction, and continuously improve their ideological and creative levels. Life is the source of literary and artistic creation, and the great practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the fertile soil for literary and artistic creation. The close connection with the people is the artistic life of all progressive literary and artistic workers. Maintaining a close connection with social life and the people is the foundation for the prosperity and development of socialist literature and art. Literary and artistic creation that is detached from the times and the people has no future. The Party and the government should take practical measures to solve the practical problems encountered by literary and artistic workers in deepening their lives.

(2) Strengthening the unity of the literary and artistic team is an important issue in the construction of socialist literature and art. Over the past half century, the revolutionary literary and artistic movement led by the Party has achieved different achievements in different periods; batch after batch of literary and artistic workers have undergone severe tests and made outstanding contributions to the revolutionary literary and artistic cause. Today, the great goal of realizing the Four Modernizations and the rejuvenation of China, and the arduous task of prospering socialist literature and art require literary and artistic workers to unite more closely, carry forward the revolutionary fine traditions, seek common ground while reserving differences, overcome various difficulties and interferences, and strive for new victories.

In the situation of drastic social changes, it is inevitable that there will be some ideological differences and confusion in the literary and artistic team. This is a problem in the process of advancement and is not to be feared. The comrades in the literary and artistic circles should, in the process of deeply studying the basic line of the Party in the primary stage of socialism, in life and creative practice, unify their understanding to one center and two basic points, and concentrate their energy on producing works and talents. The final result of the unity and self-construction of the literary and artistic team should be reflected in providing more excellent spiritual products for the people.

Our slogan remains: emancipate the mind, seek truth from facts, and unite as one to look forward. Those who cling to rigid ideas and those who negate Marxism are both in the minority. Do not regard those whose thoughts cannot keep up with the pace of reform as rigid, nor regard those who have said a few exaggerated words as engaging in bourgeois liberalization.

The Communist Party members in the literary and artistic circles should play a model and leading role in promoting the unity of the literary and artistic team and the prosperity of literature and art. They should be models in implementing the Party's line, principles, and policies, models in being proactive and diligent in work, and models in being sincere and united with comrades. Especially the leading comrades and old comrades in the literary and artistic circles should set an example and set a model for the younger generation.

It is necessary to unite all patriotic and pro-socialist artists, unite all artists who maintain national unity, including the artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas Chinese, and make more contributions to the great cause of national reunification and the further prosperity of literature and art.

(3) Our country is in a great era of profound changes and moving towards national rejuvenation. Our literary and artistic workers should deeply understand their historical mission, enhance their sense of mission and responsibility, cherish the hard-won favorable conditions today, actively engage in the prosperity of literature and art, and strive together to reach the peak of socialist literature and art.

　　中共中央关于进一步繁荣文艺的若干意见
    （一九八九年二月十七日）
    党的十一届三中全会以来，我国文艺事业出现了繁荣兴旺的新局面。随着社会主义现代化建设的蓬勃发展和改革开放的不断深入，文艺事业面临着新的形势和任务。认真贯彻党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，总结建国以来特别是新时期十年来的历史经验，改善和加强党对文艺事业的领导，坚持长期稳定地发展文艺的方针和政策，对于巩固和发展安定团结、民主和谐的政治局面，促进社会主义物质文明和精神文明的建设以及社会主义文艺的进一步繁荣，具有重要的意义。
    　　　　一、正确估价当前的文艺形势
    （一）十年来，我国的文艺事业发生了历史性的重大变化。这种变化的主要标志是：广大文艺工作者摆脱了在社会主义改造基本完成以后长期“以阶级斗争为纲”的“左”的桎梏，突破了对文艺功能的狭隘理解，思想获得很大解放，创作获得很大自由，精神面貌焕然一新。文艺作品不仅数量空前增加，而且在反映社会生活的广度和深度上有了明显进步，在促进思想解放，激励人们投身社会主义现代化建设，坚持四项基本原则和改革开放，丰富人民群众的精神文化生活方面，作出了重要贡献。在发扬民族文化优良传统的同时，许多文艺作品积极吸收外来的有益文化，在艺术上有了新的突破，内容、题材、形式、风格出现了多样化的欣欣向荣的局面。文艺评论和文艺理论研究逐渐活跃，文艺思想观念有了更新和发展。群众性的文化活动日益广泛蓬勃地开展起来。新的文艺实践，造就了新的文艺人才，一大批优秀的青年文艺家脱颖而出，给文坛、艺坛带来了生气和活力，一支为人民群众所欢迎和信赖的由老、中、青组成的社会主义文艺队伍正在逐步发展壮大。可以说，这十年是文艺战线思想活跃、成果丰硕和人才辈出的时期。
    （二）文艺战线的好形势，来自党的十一届三中全会以来路线的深入贯彻，来自改革开放形势的鼓舞和推动，来自十年来党在文艺战线上的拨乱反正和对文艺方针、政策的重大调整，来自广大文艺工作者创造性的劳动。结束十年动乱以后，党组织为大批文艺工作者平反了冤假错案，为大批受到诬陷的优秀文艺作品恢复了名誉；根据客观形势的变化，不再提“文艺为政治服务”的口号，将“为人民服务、为社会主义服务”作为文艺工作的方向；重申坚持“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，并制定了一系列旨在解放文艺生产力的政策；同时，党对文艺界出现的某些消极现象也进行了适当的批评和疏导。党在指导思想和领导方法上的转变，激发了广大文艺工作者的积极性和创造性，为他们心情舒畅地从事文艺创作创造了有利的环境和气氛。
    （三）当前文艺工作中存在的主要问题是：文艺领导工作和文艺体制与新形势的要求不太适应，社会主义商品经济条件下有关文艺工作方面的经济政策还不够健全；深刻反映社会变革和时代精神的杰出文艺作品不够多，还出现了一些消极、庸俗、涣散人心、对社会有不良影响的作品；科学的实事求是的文艺批评，未能经常地活跃地开展起来；文艺队伍中一些同志对祖国的历史文化缺乏了解，对专业基本功缺乏刻苦钻研的精神；有些同志缺乏社会责任感，存在着不同程度的脱离生活实际的情况。因此，进一步解放思想，强化建设意识，增进团结，繁荣创作，加强理论研究，就成为新形势下文艺工作亟待解决的课题。
    （四）在改革开放、发展社会主义商品经济的过程中，社会现象错综复杂，人们的思想、观念、欣赏习惯发生着很大的变化，这不能不反映到对文艺问题的认识上来。因此，对于文艺战线的形势，必须放在发展过程中作客观的、辩证的分析，千万不能简单化。既要防止只看到好的一面，不去正视那些必须解决的问题；又要防止把缺点看过了头，用老观念、老办法去观察和解决新问题。
    　　　　二、坚持“二为”方向，坚持“双百”方针
    （一）坚持文艺“为人民服务、为社会主义服务”的方向，坚持“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，是长期稳定地发展我国社会主义文艺事业的根本保证。
    社会主义文艺事业是社会主义精神文明建设的一个重要组成部分。要通过充分发挥文艺的多种功能，来振奋民族精神，提高人民群众的素质，启迪人们智慧，美化人们心灵，不断满足广大群众对文化生活的多样化、多层次的需要，熏陶、感染、教育、鼓舞人民，促进社会进步。我们的文艺要高举爱国主义、社会主义的旗帜，弘扬社会主义人道主义精神，为实现四化、振兴中华而不懈奋斗。要提倡一切有利于社会主义现代化建设和全面改革的优秀之作，提倡一切有利于激发人们奋发图强、开拓创新、积极进取的优秀之作，提倡一切有利于陶冶人们道德情操的优秀之作，这应当成为我国文艺创作的主旋律。我们需要对革命和建设及一切美好事物的热忱歌颂，也需要对丑恶、腐朽事物的鞭挞，目的和基调都应该是提高民族的自信心，增强民族的凝聚力，促进社会主义建设和改革开放的发展。只要不违反宪法、法律和国家有关规定，一切思想上无害、艺术上可取、能给予人们以艺术享受和娱乐的作品，都允许存在。
    我们的文艺工作者，要继承和发扬我国革命文艺的优良传统，摆正个人同国家、社会的关系，把国家和人民的利益放在首位，顺应历史的发展规律，认识自己在社会主义精神文明建设中的神圣使命，充分发挥自己的创作才能，为帮助人们特别是青少年成为有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的一代新人作出应有的贡献。　　（二）文艺创作作为一种特殊的精神劳动，尤其需要发挥个人的创造精神。要进一步创造一个让文艺家能够潜心创作的安定团结、民主和谐的社会环境。写什么，怎么写，文艺家应当享有充分的自由。要切实保障创作自由和评论自由，鼓励创造，提倡不同风格、流派、学派的自由竞赛，提倡科学的实事求是的批评和反批评。文艺创作上的问题，应当由文艺家们自己去讨论、研究和探索，在艺术实践中逐步求得解决，党组织和政府机构不要横加干涉。
    创作自由是我们党多年的正确主张，它受到宪法和法律的保护和制约。既不能把创作自由说成是资产阶级自由化，看到创作中出点问题就否定和取消它，也不能把它理解为对于文艺的社会意义、社会责任的取消。
    （三）文艺基本上是一种社会文化现象。文艺不等同于政治，不能要求文艺从属于政治，更不能要求文艺从属于临时的、具体的、直接的政治任务。但是，文艺又不能脱离政治。应该看到，一些文艺作品在影响人们的思想政治方面，具有很大作用，但又不可夸大它们的作用。
    （四）要正确认识和处理发扬民族文化传统与吸收外来文化的关系。发展社会主义文艺，需要保护和继承我国各民族的优秀文化遗产，也需要借鉴外国的优秀文化成果。对我国传统文化，不能采取鄙薄、否定的态度，必须坚持批判继承的方针，取其精华，弃其糟粕；对外国文化，必须坚持实行开放政策，吸收一切有益的东西，摒弃一切丑恶腐朽的东西。要克服和抵制封建主义和资本主义腐朽思想道德的影响。要在继承中华民族优良文化传统的基础上，选择和吸收世界各国的优秀文化，创造出具有时代精神的光辉灿烂的中华民族新文化。
    （五）社会主义文艺是政治方向一致性和内容、形式、风格、流派多样性的统一。我们的文艺家在“为人民服务、为社会主义服务”的根本方向上应当是共同的，在建设有中国特色的社会主义和维护祖国统一的根本任务上应当是一致的。我们要全面正确地理解“二为”与“双百”的关系，离开“二为”，“双百”就失去了方向；离开“双百”，“二为”就不能实现。二者是统一的，不可分离的，不应该把它们看成是相互对立和相互排斥的。
    　　　　三、努力改善和加强党对文艺事业的领导
    （一）党对文艺事业的领导是政治原则、政治方向的领导。这主要是指制定和调整文艺方针、政策，做好思想政治工作，保证文艺沿着正确的方向发展；通过党组织的保证监督作用和党员的先锋模范作用去开展工作；按德才兼备的标准向文艺部门推荐重要干部人选，加强领导班子建设。党不能取代政权机关管理文艺的职能，也不能包办群众文艺团体的活动。党的领导机关如果离开上述原则，对文艺事业中的其他方面管得太多太具体，就会限制文艺团体和文艺家创造性的发挥，也使自己陷入具体事务之中，影响政治领导，不利于在文艺界发挥宏观调节和引导的作用。
    （二）党的领导机关要充分尊重文艺的特点和规律，对具体的文艺作品和学术问题，要少干预、少介入。文艺作品的优劣，应由广大读者、观众和文艺界自己去评判，并要经受历史的检验。有些文艺问题的是非一时难以分清，应允许从容讨论，不要急于下结论，有的也毋需作出统一的结论。除了违反宪法和法律，必须禁止的以外，一般学术和艺术问题，不能用行政命令的方式来解决，而只能进行民主的、平等的讨论。要通过积极的、健康的评论来提倡正确的、好的东西，批评和反对不正确的、不好的东西，推动学术和艺术的发展。在文艺和学术讨论中，要对争辩、竞赛的各方实行机会均等的原则；作为评论阵地的报纸、刊物，不能只发表自己欣赏的一种观点，而拒绝发表另一种不同的观点，特别要防止不健康的思潮和情绪垄断评论阵地。对文艺家和作品，要坚持具体问题具体分析，不要以偏概全，肯定一切或否定一切。要防止因个别作品、个别人的错误而对整个文艺界或某个文艺部门采取普遍的行政措施。
    （三）领导者要正确执行党的路线、方针和政策，努力探索和研究在新的历史条件下领导好文艺工作的方式和方法。要尊重、理解和关心广大文艺工作者，加强同他们的交往和对话，使文艺界了解党为实现四化、振兴中华而进行的努力、正在进行的工作、面临的问题和解决的办法，同时也听取文艺工作者的意见。领导者作为读者或观众对文艺作品发表的个人意见，文艺工作者可以不视为必须贯彻执行的指令。
    为了使我国文艺事业得到长期稳定的发展，要维护宪法和法律赋予文艺家和文艺团体的一切权益，并进一步建立和完善文艺领域的各项法规。凡因违法必须禁止的作品，由司法机关或政府及其授权的部门依照法律或有关规定作出处理。
    　　　　四、加快和深化文艺体制改革
    （一）文艺体制改革的目的是进一步发展文艺生产力，繁荣社会主义的文艺，满足我国人民日益增长的文化生活需求。近几年来，文艺系统的体制改革，在理顺关系、转变职能、调整布局、改善管理等方面取得了一些成绩，但步子不大。关系不顺，效率不高，管理体制过于集中的状况，尚未得到根本改变，必须加快改革。
    （二）文艺体制改革首先要理顺党、政府和群众文艺团体之间的关系，明确它们各自的职能。党要实行政治领导，加强对文艺的宏观指导。政府主要是通过法律、行政、经济等多种手段，对文艺事业进行指导、规划、协调、服务、监督和管理。文联的主要职能是负责对各团体会员联络、协调和服务，协会除了上述职能外，还负有搞好评论、办好刊物、保障会员正当权益的职责。文联和协会应当密切联系群众，改善机制，成为真正代表文艺家的群众团体，成为党、政府、社会各界同文艺界以及文艺家之间协商对话的渠道和桥梁。
    （三）在文艺管理体制上，要扩大各文艺事业单位的自主权，引入竞争机制，促进人才流动，以增强文艺事业单位的生机和活力，调动文艺工作者的积极性和创造性。文艺管理体制的改革是一项系统工程，要研究制定配套改革措施。要在艺术表演团体中积极而审慎地推行“双轨制”：国营的艺术表演团体要少而精，代表国家和地方艺术水平或者具有特殊历史保留价值的艺术表演团体，由政府文化主管部门主办；非国营的艺术表演团体，由艺术家自由组合，实行集体所有制或个体所有制，自主经营，独立核算，自负盈亏。国家对不同所有制的艺术表演团体提出不同的要求，制定不同的管理办法，既要防止国营的艺术表演团体出现新的吃“大锅饭”、端“铁饭碗”的现象，又要使非国营的艺术表演团体得到应有的支持。
    （四）建立和完善社会主义文化市场，正确引导群众的文化消费。当前，一个以商品形式向人们提供精神产品和文化娱乐服务的文化市场正在我国形成。政府对文化市场实行宏观调节和间接领导，运用市场机制来组织和引导群众的文化消费，是提高精神产品质量和服务质量的方式之一。我们的文艺工作必须把社会效益作为最高标准。要努力提高精神产品的质量，改善经营管理，提高经济效益，使社会效益和经济效益很好地结合起来。
    （五）制定和完善文艺事业方面的各项经济政策。精神产品的生产不同于物质产品的生产，国家对文艺事业要在税收上给予优惠，在价格政策上适当放活。要鼓励、扶持优秀的精神产品的生产，限制低劣的精神产品的生产，引导文艺事业健康发展。老、少、边、穷地区，文艺事业比较落后，国家要更多地给予扶持和帮助。
    　　　　五、加强文艺队伍的自身建设
    （一）社会主义文艺事业的繁荣，要求我们的文艺工作者努力提高自己的思想素质和业务素质。要提倡文艺家努力学习马克思主义，学习党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策，学习文艺理论和科学文化知识，到改革和建设的实践中去，不断地提高自己的思想水平和创作水平。生活是文艺创作的源泉，建设有中国特色的社会主义的伟大实践是文艺创作的肥沃土壤，同人民群众之间的血肉联系是一切进步文艺工作者的艺术生命所在。同社会生活实践和人民群众保持密切的联系，是社会主义文艺事业兴旺发达的根基。脱离时代、脱离人民群众的文艺创作是没有前途的。党和政府要采取切实措施，解决文艺工作者深入生活所遇到的实际问题。
    （二）加强文艺队伍的团结，是建设社会主义文艺事业的一个重要问题。半个多世纪以来，党领导下的革命文艺运动，在不同的时期取得了不同的成就；一批又一批的文艺工作者经受了严峻的考验，为革命文艺事业作出了卓越贡献。今天，实现四化、振兴中华的伟大目标，繁荣社会主义文艺事业的艰巨任务，要求文艺工作者更加紧密地团结起来，发扬革命优良传统，求大同，存小异，排除各种困难和干扰，去争取新的胜利。
    在社会剧烈变革的情况下，文艺队伍中出现一些思想上的分歧和混乱是难以避免的。这是前进中的问题，并不可怕。文艺界的同志要在深入学习党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线的过程中，在生活和创作实践中，把认识统一到一个中心、两个基本点上来，把精力集中到出作品和出人才上来。文艺队伍的团结和自身建设的最终成果，要体现在为人民提供更多的优秀精神产品上。
    我们的口号仍然是：解放思想，实事求是，团结一致向前看。固守僵化观点的人和否定马克思主义的人，都是极少数。不要把思想一时跟不上改革步伐说成是僵化，也不要把讲了点过头话说成是搞资产阶级自由化。
    文艺工作者中的共产党员应当在促进文艺队伍团结和繁荣文艺方面起模范带头作用。他们应当成为执行党的路线、方针和政策的模范，积极进取、奋发工作的模范，真诚待人、团结同志的模范。特别是文艺界的领导同志和老同志，更要以身作则，为年轻一代树立楷模。
    要团结一切爱国的、拥护社会主义的文艺家，团结一切维护祖国统一的文艺家，包括台湾同胞、港澳同胞和海外侨胞中的文艺家，为祖国的统一大业和文学艺术的进一步繁荣多作贡献。
    （三）我们的国家正处在一个深刻变革，走向民族振兴的伟大时代。我们的文艺工作者要深刻认识自己所肩负的历史重任，增强使命感和责任心，珍惜今天来之不易的有利条件，积极投身于繁荣文艺的事业，共同攀登社会主义文学艺术的高峰。
