Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 29th.

The masses have reported a large number of case leads. Cases of embezzlement and bribery that have been reported and investigated account for half of the major cases investigated by the procuratorial organs.

The Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Liu Fuzhi, said today that the establishment of reporting agencies at all levels of procuratorial organs across the country indicates that reporting work has played a significant role in the fight against embezzlement and bribery crimes.

Liu Fuzhi said that by the end of 1988, there were 2,784 procuratorial organs nationwide that had established reporting centers (stations) or set up reporting hotlines, and 158 large and medium-sized cities had established reporting centers. In the second half of 1988, various reporting agencies received a total of more than 147,000 reports, of which more than 52,000 involved embezzlement and bribery issues. The procuratorial organs are currently investigating these reports, and more than 5,700 cases have been filed for investigation, including more than 1,500 major cases involving amounts of 100,000 yuan or more. The number of major cases filed through reporting channels accounts for 50% of the total number of embezzlement and bribery major cases investigated by the procuratorial organs, which is more than 2,900 cases.

He said that in the past half year, we have investigated issues involving 241 department-level cadres. Preliminary investigations have found: 15 cases to be true (8 cases have been filed, 2 people have been arrested, 1 person has been prosecuted); 88 cases are still under investigation; 115 cases fall within the scope of party and administrative discipline, and have been transferred to relevant departments for handling; 23 cases are found to be false reports. Among the reported materials, 19 involve provincial and ministerial-level cadres, with 4 people's issues currently under investigation; 11 cases fall within the scope of party and administrative discipline, and have been transferred to relevant departments for handling; 4 cases are found to be false reports.

Liu Fuzhi said that the masses' reports have provided the procuratorial organs with a large number of valuable case leads, greatly strengthening the procuratorial organs' foundation in the fight against embezzlement and bribery crimes, and also promoting the work of handling complaints and appeals. Currently, the reporting work has begun to gain momentum and has shown initial effectiveness. In the second half of 1988, more than 650 people across the country surrendered to the procuratorial organs with illicit funds and items, totaling more than 6.23 million yuan.

He said that the procuratorial organs sincerely welcome and seriously handle reports from any quarter and any individual regarding embezzlement and bribery issues, and hope that people will speak out without reservation. Regardless of whose embezzlement and bribery issues are involved, the procuratorial organs will definitely conduct a thorough investigation, adhere to the facts, adhere to the law, handle cases impartially, and will not show leniency.

　　群众举报大量案件线索        
    举报立案的贪污受贿大案占检察机关侦查大案的一半
    新华社北京３月２９日电  最高人民检察院检察长刘复之今天说，全国各级检察机关建立举报机构的情况说明，举报工作在反贪污、受贿犯罪斗争中起到了显著作用。
    刘复之说，截至１９８８年底，全国有２７８４个检察院建立了举报中心（站）或设置举报电话，１５８个大中城市建立了举报中心。１９８８年下半年各举报机构共受理举报材料１４７０００多件，其中反映贪污、受贿问题的有５２０００多件，检察机关正在进行调查，现已立案侦查的有５７００多件，万元以上的大案有１５００多件。通过举报渠道立案的大案数占检察机关立案侦查的全部贪污、受贿大案２９００多件的５０％。
    他说，半年来，我们调查了涉及２４１名司局级干部的问题。初步查明：属实的１５人（已立案８人，逮捕２人，起诉１人）；正在调查的８８人；属于党纪、政纪范围的１１５人，已转有关部门查处；属于举报不实的２３人。举报材料中涉及１９名省、部级干部，有４个人的问题正在调查；属于党纪、政纪范围的１１人，已转有关部门查处；属于举报不实的４人。
    刘复之说，群众举报，为检察机关提供了大量有价值的案件线索，有力地加强了检察机关开展反贪污、受贿犯罪斗争的群众基础，也推动了受理控告、申诉的工作。目前举报工作开始形成一定声势，初步显示了威力。１９８８年下半年，全国有６５０多人携带赃款、赃物到检察机关投案、自首，金额总计６２３万多元。
    他说，检察机关竭诚欢迎和认真受理来自任何方面、任何个人关于贪污、受贿问题的举报，并且希望知无不言、言无不尽。不论涉及任何人的贪污、受贿问题，检察机关一定认真调查，忠于事实，忠于法律，秉公办案，绝不手软。
