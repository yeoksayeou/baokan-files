Clever Combination, Friendly Collaboration:
Peking Opera and Kabuki Jointly Stage "Dragon King" in Japan

Our reporter Sun Dongmin and Yu Qing report from Tokyo: A grand mythological play "Dragon King," performed using both Chinese Peking Opera and Japanese Kabuki arts, premiered today at the Shinbashi Enbujo Theater in Tokyo, receiving a warm welcome from the Japanese audience.

As cultural exchanges between China and Japan continue to deepen, theater artists from both countries have independently proposed a bold idea: Can the two Eastern arts, Chinese Peking Opera and Japanese Kabuki, be combined and performed on the same stage? Now, through the joint efforts of theater artists from both countries, this idea has finally come to fruition.

The mythological play "Dragon King" is based on the story of "Ne Zha's Rebellion in the Sea" from the "Investiture of the Gods." The director of the China National Peking Opera Company, Lü Ruiming, and the Japanese Kabuki scriptwriter Naha Shoho, adapted and reworked the story based on Japanese mythology. The plot revolves around the Shang Dynasty in China and the Jomon period in Japan, when the country was known as Wa. Beneath the deep waters of the East China Sea lies the Dragon Palace of the Eastern Sea Dragon King Ao Guang. During a visit to Mount Fuji, the Chinese boy Ne Zha encounters the Dragon Prince Ao Bing abducting the wife of the Japanese fisherman leader Haiyan. Ne Zha, acting bravely, kills Ao Bing and rescues Haiyan's wife. Grateful, Haiyan and Ne Zha become sworn brothers. Enraged, the Dragon King uses his magic to flood the Chen Tang Pass, which is guarded by General Li Jing. Ne Zha, to protect the villagers, takes responsibility and commits suicide in front of his parents. Haiyan decides to go to China, sincerely appealing to the heavens to bring Ne Zha back to life. After many tribulations, Ne Zha and Haiyan join forces to defeat the enemy, subdue the Dragon King, and restore peace and tranquility to the vast ocean.

Vice Minister of Culture Ying Ruocheng and Director of the China National Peking Opera Company Lü Ruiming, who specially came from Beijing to attend the premiere in Tokyo, believe that since the 20th century, theater artists worldwide have been striving to pursue different forms of expression. However, for a considerable period, naturalism dominated the stage.

Peking Opera and Kabuki, as Eastern theater arts, often draw from legends, traditional stories, and historical figures. In terms of artistic techniques, they are not bound by time and space, both emphasizing singing, dancing, dialogue, stage presence, and martial arts. They use percussion instruments and employ exaggerated, distorted forms to depict life, openly acknowledging the artificiality of the stage and revealing the inner secrets to the audience. Therefore, the joint performance of "Dragon King" by Peking Opera and Kabuki has both a common foundation and challenges. Whether these two theater arts can be fused without giving the impression of being pieced together was a concern before the performance. However, the performance proved these concerns to be unfounded. On the magnificent stage, both countries' traditional artistic styles were preserved, aided by modern lighting, sets, and a three-dimensional stage with elevators, presenting vivid images to the audience.

In the backstage dressing room, we interviewed the two main actors from China and Japan, Ichikawa Ennosuke and Li Guang. Ichikawa's grandfather (the second Ennosuke) led the Kabuki troupe to visit China in 1955 and was received by Chinese leaders. In 1956, he hosted the great master Mei Lanfang in Japan. The Ichikawa family has dedicated three generations to Sino-Japanese friendship. The current Ennosuke has visited China four times and has developed a deep friendship with Li Guang. He expressed his hope that Chinese audiences could also see "Dragon King" performed in China. Li Guang said that due to the joint efforts of artists from both countries, the cooperation was smooth, and in the parts where the Peking Opera and Kabuki stages intersect, both sides have incorporated each other's strengths. The reporter observed that Mr. Ichikawa made great efforts to present the plot using Peking Opera forms, leaving a deep impression with his outstanding performance. The mutual inspiration and absorption of the actors from both countries undoubtedly enriched their respective artistic expressions.

Japanese government officials and friendly organizations have given enthusiastic encouragement to the joint performance by Chinese and Japanese artists. In his congratulatory message, Japanese Foreign Minister Uno said that this performance is an unprecedented innovation in the world, noteworthy not only between China and Japan but also in the history of global cultural exchanges.

It is reported that the play will be performed in Tokyo and Nagoya until the end of May and will later be performed in China. Recently, tickets for the performance in Tokyo have been sold out in advance.

　　巧妙结合　友好联袂
    京剧与歌舞伎合排《龙王》在日公演
    本报东京３月４日电  记者孙东民、于青报道：一出用中国的京剧和日本的歌舞伎两种艺术形式同台演出的大型神话剧《龙王》今天正式在东京新桥演舞场开始公演，受到日本观众的热烈欢迎。
    随着中日两国文化交流的不断发展，两国的戏剧艺术家都曾不约而同地提出大胆设想：能否把东方艺术的两枝奇葩——中国的京剧与日本的歌舞伎合二为一，同台演出呢？现在，经过两国戏剧家的共同努力，这一设想终于如愿以偿。
    神话剧《龙王》基本素材取自《封神演义》中的“哪吒闹海”，中国京剧院院长吕瑞明与日本歌舞伎剧本作家奈河彰辅又根据日本的神话传说，改编加工而成。剧情大意是，在中国的殷商时代，当时的扶桑列岛之国日本还被叫做倭的绳文时期，横亘两国的东海海底深处是东海龙王敖光的龙宫。中国少年哪吒到富士山游玩时，恰巧碰到龙太子敖丙掠夺日本渔民头领海彦之妻。哪吒见义勇为，打死龙太子敖丙，救出海彦之妻。海彦感其恩义，与哪吒结拜兄弟。既恼又怒的龙王施展法术，水淹总兵李靖镇守的陈塘关，哪吒为保护村民在父母面前引责自刎。海彦决计前往中国，以诚打动上苍终于使哪吒复生，后经七灾八难，哪吒与海彦合力斗敌，降伏龙王，辽阔的海洋又恢复了和平与安宁。
    特意从北京赶来出席东京首场演出的文化部副部长英若诚和中国京戏院院长吕瑞明认为，进入２０世纪以来，全世界的戏剧家都在努力追求不同的表现形式，但相当一段时间，舞台上自然主义占统治地位。
    京剧和歌舞伎作为东方的戏剧艺术，在取材上多是表现传说、传统故事、历史人物；在艺术手法上都不受时空的限制，都讲歌舞、台词、亮相、武打，都用打击乐，都是用变形、夸张的形式表现生活，都公开承认舞台的假定性，把内心的奥秘完全告诉观众。正因为如此，京剧与歌舞伎同台演出《龙王》既有共同基础，也有困难之处。两种戏剧艺术能否融合在一起，而不至给人留下拼凑的印象，事前在一些人中不无担心。演出结束，证明这种担心是多余的。在华美的舞台上，既保持着两国传统的艺术风格，又借助现代的灯光、布景和有升降的立体舞台，一个个生动的形象展现在观众面前。
    在后台化妆室里，我们访问了正在化妆的中日两位主要演员市川猿之助和李光。市川的祖父（第二代猿之助）１９５５年曾第一次率歌舞伎剧团访问过中国，受到中国领导人的接见，１９５６年，他又在日本接待了梅兰芳大师，市川祖孙三代致力于日中友好。现在的猿之助曾４次访华，与李光结下了深厚友谊。他表示，希望中国的观众也能看到《龙王》在中国演出。李光说，由于两国艺术家的共同努力，双方合作顺利，在京剧与歌舞伎舞台接点部分，双方都融汇了对方的长处。记者看到，市川先生为用京剧形式表现剧情做出了巨大的努力，他出色的表演给人留下深刻印象。两国演员互为启发吸收，无疑丰富了各自的艺术表现手段。
    对于中日两国艺术家的同台演出，日本政府人士和友好团体给予了热情鼓励。日本外相宇野在贺词中说，这次公演在世界上是史无前例的创举，不仅在中日两国之间，在世界文化交流史上也是值得注目的尝试。
    据悉，此剧将在东京和名古屋上演至５月底，以后还要在中国公演。日前，在东京演出的剧票已提前售完。
