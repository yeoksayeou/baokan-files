	Chile and the U.S. Jointly Draft Plan to Calm Grape Controversy
		Our reporter Cang Lide reports from Washington, March 15: Yesterday and today, U.S. authorities have not discovered any fruits from Chile contaminated with cyanide. Some grapes, apples, peaches, and plums imported from Chile, after being inspected, have reappeared on the U.S. market.

		To resolve the fruit dispute between the U.S. and Chile, the Chilean Foreign Minister arrived in Washington today. He said that fruit exports are a major issue for Chile, affecting the livelihoods of 200,000 people and $600 million in foreign exchange earnings. He hopes to find a compromise solution with the U.S. side.

		Officials from both the U.S. and Chile are drafting a plan. The main points are: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will dispatch 500 inspectors to visually inspect 10% of each type of Chilean fruit. If no issues are found, the fruits will be allowed to be sold. However, Chilean melons are excluded from this plan because visual inspection cannot determine if harmful toxins have been injected. The Chilean authorities will immediately implement special inspections and safety measures at farms, stations, and docks.

		The U.S. action to boycott imported fruits has angered Chilean farmers. It is estimated that currently, 17,000 Chilean fruit industry workers have lost their jobs, and the fruit production and export industry has suffered severe losses.

		According to reports, two grapes containing cyanide were found in Philadelphia last Sunday, originating from the Campo Lindo vineyard in Chile. The perpetrator has not yet been found.

　　智美共拟计划平息葡萄风波
    本报华盛顿３月１５日电  记者仓立德报道：昨日至今日，美国当局再未发现任何沾染氰化物的智利水果。从智利进口的部分葡萄、苹果、油桃、李子等，经过检验后重新出现在美国市场上。
    为解决美、智之间的水果争端，智利外长今天抵达华盛顿。他说，水果出口是关系到智利２０万人生计和６亿美元外汇收入的大问题，希望能与美国方面找到妥协解决方法。
    美、智双方官员正在拟定一项计划，主要内容是：美国食品和药物管理局指派５００名检验员，对每种智利水果抽样１０％进行目力检查，如无问题即允许上市。但智利甜瓜被排除在外，因靠目力无法知道是否注射过有害毒素。智利当局则立即在水果农场、货站、码头采取特殊检查及安全措施。
    美国抵制进口水果的行动已引起智利果农的愤怒。据估计，目前已有１．７万名智利果业职工丧失了工作，水果生产及出口业遭到严重损失。
    据报道，星期日在费城发现的两颗含有氰化物的葡萄，其产地在智利的坎波林多葡萄园。眼下还未找到破坏者的踪迹。
