Today, social order in Lhasa is gradually stabilizing. Water, electricity, and food supplies are basically normal. Schools have reopened. Some individual businesses that were previously hesitant have now reopened. In the Beijing East Road area, some units are reinstalling the glass that was smashed during the disturbances, and sanitation workers have cleaned up the remnants of the vandalism, looting, arson, and other chaos. Due to the extensive damage to the property of merchants in this area, it will be difficult for them to recover in the short term.

Lhasa Mayor Luo Ga said in an interview with a reporter that to ensure the supply of meat and butter to residents, the government is expediting the organization of goods and clearing the channels of circulation. It has also decided to provide each household with 4 pounds of butter per month at a subsidized price, with the government covering the difference between the market price and the subsidized price of 2.5 to 3 yuan per pound.

　　拉萨水电食品供应正常  街头骚乱残物清扫干净
    本报拉萨３月１１日电  记者卢小飞报道：今天，拉萨社会秩序趋于稳定。水、电、食品供应基本正常。各小学今天开学。一些曾心有余悸的个体商店已开门营业。北京东路一带，一些单位正在安装被骚乱分子打碎的玻璃，清洁工已将打、砸、抢、烧留下的残物清扫干净。由于这一带商户的财产基本被烧光、抢光，短期内还难以恢复元气。
    拉萨市长洛嘎在接受记者采访时说，为保障居民的肉食、酥油供给，政府正加紧组织货源，疏通流通渠道，并决定每户居民每月凭证供应４斤酥油，每斤价格低于市场价２元５角至３元，差价由政府补贴。
