People's Daily, Washington, March 10th. Reporter Zhang Qixun reports: President Bush announced this afternoon at the White House that he has nominated Representative Richard Cheney to be the Secretary of Defense. This is the day after the Senate rejected Tor's nomination, and Bush has proposed a new candidate for the position of Secretary of Defense.

Cheney is 48 years old. From 1975 to 1976, he served as the White House Chief of Staff under President Ford. He has worked with Bush in Republican Party leadership positions and is currently the second-highest-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives and a key member of the House Intelligence Committee's Budget Subcommittee. Bush introduced Cheney at today's press conference, saying that Cheney is a widely respected, principled individual who has handled defense issues in both the government and Congress. He believes that Cheney will become an outstanding leader of America's military forces.

According to reports, Cheney's nomination has been praised by both parties in Congress. The Senate Armed Services Committee announced that it will begin hearings next week and proceed as quickly as possible. Democratic Senator and committee chairman Nunn said that Cheney is experienced and highly qualified, and that his confirmation will not encounter any obstacles.

    据报道，切尼这一人选受到国会两党的赞赏。参议院军事委员会宣布将于下周开始举行听证，并尽速进行。民主党参议员、军委会主席纳恩称，切尼经验丰富，十分称职，对他的确认不会遇到障碍。
