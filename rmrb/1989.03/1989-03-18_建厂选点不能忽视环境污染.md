Title: Factory Site Selection Must Not Overlook Environmental Pollution

	At the end of last year, our region conducted a survey of the environmental protection work in 17 counties (cities). It was found that some counties (cities) have blindly set up township enterprises, bringing new pollution to urban and rural environments.

	Along the 10-kilometer stretch of the E River that runs through the city of Yuxian County, 21 coke plants have been put into operation in the past one or two years, with another 6 coke plants under construction. One small-scale coke plant is less than 30 meters away from the water source. The director of the Urban Construction Bureau of Yuxian County said, "The groundwater layer here is 8 to 10 meters below the surface. Once polluted, the drinking water for humans and livestock in the entire county will be a problem."

	Near the national key cultural relic protection unit, Guangsheng Temple in Hongdong County, two factories, the Shanxi Province Coking Plant and the Linfen Region Cement Plant, were built in the early 1970s. The pollution problems caused by this irrational layout have not been resolved. In April 1985, the village of Guting, located less than 300 meters from Guangsheng Temple and the source of the Huoquan River, built a paper mill. In 1986, Hongdong County issued a document ordering this paper mill to cease production, and the Industrial and Commercial Bureau revoked the mill's business license. However, to this day, the factory continues to operate. In February 1988, a small blast furnace started production about 400 meters from Guangsheng Temple, with no measures taken to treat the discharged water, gas, and slag. Near the small blast furnace, a formic acid plant is under construction in Guting Village.

	The Xunshui River, which flows through the city of Puxian County, used to have clear water. Due to the pollution from the waste water used for slag washing and dust removal by the Puxian Power Plant, the river water has turned black, and the riverbed is covered with a layer of coal ash up to 10 centimeters thick.

	In 1986, a castor oil factory was built in Yonghe County with an investment of 3.1 million yuan, located on the banks of the Zhi River, less than two kilometers from the county seat. After the factory started production in February 1988, more than 20 tons of oily wastewater was discharged into the Zhi River untreated every day, making the water in the Zhi River undrinkable for humans and livestock. Reasonably planning the layout of township industrial projects can not only reduce environmental pollution but also save investment in pollution control. It is hoped that relevant departments will carefully consider this when selecting sites for factory construction.

### 建厂选点不能忽视环境污染

　　建厂选点不能忽视环境污染
    去年底，我地区对１７个县（市）的环保工作作了调查，发现一些县（市）在兴办乡镇企业中，盲目设点，给城乡环境带来新的污染。
    在纵贯乡宁县城的鄂河两岸１０多公里内，近一二年已有２１家炼焦厂投产，还有６家炼焦厂正在建设之中。一家土炼焦厂距水源不到３０米。乡宁县城建局长说：“这里的地下水层距地面８米至１０米，一旦被污染，全县城的人畜饮水都会成问题。”
    在国家重点文物保护单位洪洞县广胜寺附近，７０年代初，先后建起了山西省焦化厂和临汾地区水泥厂。这种不合理布局带来的污染问题还没有解决，１９８５年４月，圪同村在距广胜寺和霍泉源头不到３００米处，又建１家造纸厂。１９８６年洪洞县行文要求这家造纸厂停产，工商部门也吊销了这家造纸厂的执照，但时至今日，这家工厂仍照常生产。１９８８年２月，一座小高炉又在距广胜寺区约４００米处点火投产，未见有人对排放的水、气、渣采取治理措施。在小高炉附近，圪同村的一座草酸厂正在兴建。
    流经蒲县县城的昕水河，原来河水清澈，由于蒲县电厂冲渣除尘的废水污染，河水已成黑色，河床上积淀的煤灰厚达十几厘米。
    １９８６年，投资３１０万元建设的永和县蓖麻油厂，位于芝河边，距县城不到两公里。１９８８年２月这家油厂投产后，每天有２０多吨油脂污水未经处理便排入芝河，致使人畜都不能饮用芝河水。合理布局乡镇工业建设项目，不仅可以减轻环境污染，而且还能节省治理污染的投资，希望有关部门在选点建厂时，慎重考虑。
