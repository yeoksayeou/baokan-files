Before the Opening

On the afternoon of March 20th, at around 2:30 PM, some party and state leaders attending the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress gathered in a rest room near the conference hall's presidium.

Commissioner of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Wan Li, greeted the reporters covering the congress with a broad smile. When the reporter informed him that the opening ceremony would be broadcast live on radio and television, Wan Li interrupted with a laugh, "I know, you want me to speak slowly and clearly during the chairing of the meeting. But everyone is afraid of my Shandong accent. It seems my Shandong accent is here to stay!"

Premier Li Peng, dressed in a dark blue double-breasted suit, looked dignified and elegant. He quickly entered the rest room and shook hands with everyone who had arrived earlier. At that moment, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang walked in, shaking hands with Li Peng while humorously saying, "Today you are the 'matchmaker,' the main focus will be on your performance!"

"Being this 'matchmaker' is not easy," Li Peng replied.

"Don't worry," Zhao Ziyang said with a smile.

Zhao Ziyang then asked Li Peng, "How long will the report take to deliver? Do you need a break in the middle?"

Li Peng answered, "About two hours, a total of 55 pages, no need for a break."

Seeing Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Yao Yilin, Li Peng walked over to shake hands with them.

Li Xiannian asked Li Peng, "Will you be standing or sitting while delivering your report?"

"Reporting to the Chairman, I will be standing," Li Peng replied.

"Can you stand for more than two hours?" Li Xiannian asked.

"He is a strong laborer, he can handle it!" Yang Shangkun interjected humorously.

Li Peng, smiling, greeted Wang Zhen and said to Yang Shangkun, Li Xiannian, and Wang Zhen, "Please rest assured, I can handle it."

After that, Li Peng sat down between Li Xiannian and Yao Yilin. Yao Yilin said to Li Peng, "I have read the government work report several times, it is well revised."

Li Peng said, "Drafting and revising the report is not an easy task. Let's hear the representatives' opinions during the meeting."

As Hu Yaobang entered the rest room, he greeted each person present with a handshake. Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Alpuo Awangjinmei, shook hands with Hu Yaobang and asked, "How has your health been recently?"

"After a trip to Nanning, I lost two kilograms," Hu Yaobang replied, holding up two fingers.

"Being thin is good for the elderly," Qiao Shi chimed in with a smile.

"Indeed, it's a good thing. You can't buy old age thinness with money," Hu Yaobang agreed.

Seeing Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang stood up to shake his hand, inquiring about his health and advising him to take care of himself.

Hu Yaobang said, "You are busy with work and have a heavy burden, you should also take care of your health!"

"Let's both take care of our health," Zhao Ziyang replied.

The bell signaling the start of the meeting rang. Wan Li stood up and invited everyone to take their seats. Zhao Ziyang was the first to stand, gesturing with his hands, "Today, you should walk in front, you are the host!"

Li Peng followed, "I am here to report my work to the representatives."

Li Xiannian said, "You are here to report your work, go!" With that, Wan Li, Zhao Ziyang, Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Li Xiannian, and others walked towards the presidium of the conference hall.

　　开幕之前
    ３月２０日下午２时半左右，出席七届全国人大二次会议的党和国家一些领导人来到大会堂主席台附近的一间休息室。
    万里委员长满面笑容地同采访人代会的记者打招呼。记者告诉他，今天广播和电视将现场转播大会开幕式实况。没等记者把话说完，万里就笑着说：“我知道，你是让我主持会时说话慢一点，声音清楚一点。不过，谁都怕我这山东话。看来，我的山东话是改不了啦！”
    李鹏总理今天身穿一套藏蓝色双排扣西装，显得庄重、潇洒。他快步走进休息厅，同先到的同志一一握手。这时，赵紫阳总书记走了进来，他一面同李鹏握手，一面风趣地说：“今天你是‘红娘’，主要看你的戏啦！”
    “这个‘红娘’不好当啊！”李鹏说。
    “没关系。”赵紫阳笑着说。
    赵紫阳关切地问李鹏：“报告大概要念多长时间？要不要中间休息一下？”
    李鹏回答：“大约两个小时，一共５５页，不需要休息。”
    看到全国政协主席李先念和国务院副总理姚依林也来了，李鹏走过去同他俩一一握手。
    李先念问李鹏：“你今天是站着讲还是坐着讲？”
    “报告主席，我站着讲。”
    “站两个多小时能顶得住吗？”
    “他是壮劳力，能行！”一旁的杨尚昆诙谐地插话。
    李鹏一边笑着向王震打招呼，一边对杨尚昆、李先念、王震三位老同志说：“请三位主席放心，我能行。”
    说完，李鹏就势坐在李先念和姚依林中间。姚依林对李鹏说：“政府工作报告我看了几遍，改得不错。”
    李鹏说：“起草报告、修改报告，都不是轻松的事，会上再听听代表们的意见吧。”
    胡耀邦一进休息室，就同在座的每个同志握手、打招呼。全国人大常委会副委员长阿沛·阿旺晋美一面同他握手，一面问：“最近身体怎么样？”
    “到了趟南宁，跑瘦了两公斤。”胡耀邦伸出两个指头比划着说。
    “老年人瘦点有好处。”乔石笑着搭话说。
    “的确是好事。有钱难买老来瘦嘛！”胡耀邦赞同地说。
    见胡耀邦来了，赵紫阳站起来同他握手，询问他的身体近况，要他注意身体。
    胡耀邦说：“你现在工作忙，担子重，也要注意身体啊！”
    “咱们都要注意保重身体。”赵紫阳说。
    大会开幕的预备铃声响了。万里起身请大家入席。赵紫阳第一个站起来，打着手势说：“今天你应该走在最前面，你是东道主嘛！”李鹏接着话说：“我今天是来接受代表审议工作的。”李先念说：“你是来报告工作的，走！”说罢，万里和赵紫阳、杨尚昆、李鹏、李先念等一起走向大会主席台。
