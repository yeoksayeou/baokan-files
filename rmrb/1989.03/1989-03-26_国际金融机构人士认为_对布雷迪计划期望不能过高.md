Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 24th.

According to a report by the *Washington Post* today, financial officials from Western Europe and some international financial institutions believe that new U.S. proposals to reduce the debt of third-world countries should not be over-optimistic.

The report said that although U.S. Treasury Secretary Brady's new proposal to reduce the debt of third-world countries, made on March 10, has been welcomed, if the U.S. does not come up with detailed implementation measures, it may lead to disappointment.

A senior official from the World Bank said that the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can make significant contributions to reducing the debt of third-world countries, but they cannot bear additional financial burdens. Therefore, the first step is to solve the problem of funding guarantees for debtor countries.

Some financial officials from Western Europe believe that without solving the problem of funding sources, Brady's proposal may disappoint debtor countries, potentially leading them to stop repaying their debts.

An official from the U.S. Treasury said that it is natural for the new plan to reduce the debt of third-world countries to cause unease, and he hopes that this unease can be resolved soon.

　　国际金融机构人士认为        
    对布雷迪计划期望不能过高
    新华社华盛顿三月二十四日电  据《华盛顿邮报》今天报道，西欧金融界和一些国际金融机构的负责人认为，对美国减免第三世界债务的新建议不应寄于过高的希望。
    报道说，美国财政部长布雷迪三月十日提出减免第三世界债务的新建议虽得到人们的欢迎，但如果美国提不出实施的详细措施，就可能引起失望。
    世界银行的一位高级官员说，国际货币基金组织和世界银行可为减免第三世界债务作出重大贡献，但它们难以承担额外的资金负担。因此，首先要解决为债务国担保的资金来源问题。
    西欧金融界的一些人士认为，如果不解决资金来源，布雷迪建议就难免使债务国失望，从而有可能导致它们停止偿还债务。
    美国财政部的一位官员说，新的减免第三世界债务计划引起不安是自然的，希望这种不安能很快得以解决。
