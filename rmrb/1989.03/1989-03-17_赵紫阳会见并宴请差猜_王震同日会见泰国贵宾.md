Zhao Ziyang Meets and Hosts Dinner for Chatichai
Wang Zhen Meets Thai Guests on the Same Day

BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) — General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Ziyang, said that with the international situation becoming more relaxed, major powers are shifting from military confrontation to competition in comprehensive national strength. This provides a good opportunity for developing countries like us. We should make use of this trend to speed up our own development and narrow the gap between us and developed countries.

He made the remarks this afternoon at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse when meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan. He praised the good relations between China and Thailand, saying that the two countries have conducted fruitful cooperation in various fields with satisfactory results. "In economic cooperation between China and Thailand, there are many things to do. We will actively promote this aspect," he said.

On the Cambodian issue, Zhao Ziyang said that China and Thailand have always supported each other. At this crucial moment when a political settlement of the Cambodian issue is in sight, China and Thailand should continue to work together to push for an early settlement of the Cambodian issue.

Chatichai expressed his thanks for the warm reception he received during his visit to China. He said that the current international situation is forcing Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia. Vietnam has announced that it will withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of September this year, and it should keep its promise.

After the meeting, Zhao Ziyang hosted a dinner for Chatichai and his wife. Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila attended the meeting and dinner.

In another development, Vice President Wang Zhen met with Thai Prime Minister Chatichai this morning at the Great Hall of the People. The two sides had a friendly and cordial talk.
