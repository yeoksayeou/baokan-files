The Mysterious Eyes
Xiang Jing

	I had never paid much attention to the things around me, but when I looked up, I was greatly surprised, thinking it must be an illusion. However, it was true: on the gray-green tree trunk, there was an eye embedded, lifeless yet exuding a strange vitality... one, then another, some close together, others far apart, seemingly watching the bustling world. But why were they always single eyes? And where did they come from?

	Were they carved by mischievous children? But children's handiwork could not be so lifelike. Besides, those high places were beyond the reach of children's hands. Then, were they the work of artists? However, walking past five or six trees, I saw that each trunk was meticulously carved with these many eyes.

	It was indeed a mysterious puzzle.

	In my bewilderment, a bizarre idea flashed through my mind, and I suddenly remembered an old Chinese saying: "Heaven has eyes." It seemed that heaven really had eyes. Not to mention the places where people live and work, even on these streets and open fields, there were countless eyes watching every passerby. Whether it was joy or sorrow, good or evil, it was all recorded in some eye. Now, there is a fashionable phrase, "increase transparency," but it seems that everything has always been exposed and transparent.

	But where did the vitality in these eyes come from?

	I gazed at the row of tall, green poplars stretching towards the sky, at their sturdy trunks firmly rooted in the earth, and gradually began to understand: the trees stood tall because of their deep roots in the soil. And beneath the earth... Oh, could it be? Could it be that the spirits of those who lie buried here, in the underworld, rise along the roots and attach themselves to the tree trunks? Look at these eyes: some are joyful, some sad, some wise, some dull, gentle and cold, cunning and angry, all mixed together—is this how the departed are? If so, there should be my ancestors and my forebears among them. Suddenly, these many eyes became familiar to me, and I carefully examined each one, searching for my long-departed ancestors. Thinking that one day, I too would become one of these eyes, I felt a sense of unease. At that time, what kind of expression would my eyes have?

	Standing under the trees, gazing, contemplating, and thinking for a long time... gradually, my thoughts went back to every late spring, when the gardeners climbed the ladders, wielding sharp tools, and chopped away at the branches. With each crackling sound, green branches fell to the ground, covering this street. Thus, in the places that had been pruned, a round scar remained, which was the embryo of the eyes, and with the growth of the tree rings and the washing of the rain, these scars not only resembled eyes but also had their own unique expressions.

	I stood in front of the trees for a long time, pondering for a long time, and could not help but be amazed, shocked, and moved by the childlike wonder and magic of nature.

	I had already reached the end of the row of poplars, and turning back to look, I could still clearly feel the presence of each eye. They could grow on tree trunks, and surely they could also attach themselves to any object. They not only capture the behavior and souls of the masses but also watch over the joys and sorrows of every transient life, blessing the upright and good, and angering the heartless and unrighteous...

　　神奇的眼
    向荆
    未曾留意过身旁的事物，这一抬头便大大吃惊了，以为是自己的错觉。然而，千真万确，在泛着绿意的银灰色树干上嵌着一只眼睛，尽管没有生命，却自有一股灵气在游弋……一只，又一只，有的凑在一起，有的远远独自注视，仿佛在窥视纷繁的人生。可为什么总是单只的眼睛呢？它们又从何而来的呢？
    是淘气包们刻上去的？可孩子的手笔哪有这么传神。况且，那高处，是孩子的手所不能及的。那么，是画家们的杰作？然而，一连走过五六棵树，却见每一根树干上都一丝不苟地刻着这许多眸子。
    真是个神奇的谜团。
    迷惑中一个怪诞的想法在脑子里闪了一下，陡然记起中国的一句老话：苍天有眼。如此看来，苍天果真是有眼睛的了。且不提人们居住、工作的场所，就连这街道和旷地，原也有无数只眸子在盯着过往的每个行人。不论是喜还是忧，是善还是恶，都已存入某一只眸子里了。现在，有句时髦用语，叫做：增加透明度，却原来，一切本就是裸露的，一览无余的。
    而这眸子中的灵气又是从何而来？
    久久地望着这排静静伸向天空的青杨，望着它那牢牢伫立在大地上的粗壮的躯干，渐渐有些感悟：大树所以能够站立起来，靠的是深深扎入泥土中的根须。而地下……噢，莫不是？难道说长眠者的英灵，在九泉之下顺着根须的吮吸，升腾上来附在树干上？瞧这些眼神，有的愉悦、有的忧伤、有的聪慧、有的呆滞，温和与冷漠、狡黠与愤怒交织在一起——难道逝者如斯夫吗？若如此，其中该有我的前辈和我的祖先了。顿时，这许多的眸子便同我亲近起来，我仔细辨别每一只眸子，寻找我那久已作古的先人。想到有一天，我的整个都将化作这么一只眸子，心中不禁有些惶惑。到那时，我的眼神会是其中的哪一类呢？
    站在树下久久地注视着、审度着、沉思着……渐渐我的思绪追溯到每年暮春时节，园林工人架着云梯，手握利刃，登上树杈，随着咔嚓咔嚓的砍伐声，绿色的枝条便铺满这条街道。于是，在修理过的地方便留下了一个圆形的斑痕，这便是眸子的雏形，又随着树干年轮的增加，风雨的洗涤，这些斑痕便不仅酷似眸子并且具有了自己独特的神情。
    又在树前站立了良久，沉吟了良久，我不得不为大自然的童心与魔力而赞叹、而震惊、而倾倒。
    已经走到这排杨树的尽头了，返身望去，我仍然清晰地感觉到每一只眸子的存在。它们既可在树干上生长，想必也能够在任何物体上附着。它不但拍摄着芸芸众生的行为与灵魂，也在注视着每个人生过客的悲喜忧游，为正直善良祝福、更为那些无情无义而愤怒……
