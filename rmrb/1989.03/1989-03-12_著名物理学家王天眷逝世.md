Renowned physicist, research fellow of the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, member of the 5th, 6th, and 7th National Committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, chairman of the Spectroscopy Committee of the Chinese Physical Society, chairman of the Time and Frequency Committee of the Chinese Society of Metrology, consultant of the Quantum Electronics and Optoelectronics Committee of the Chinese Institute of Electronics, editorial board member of the Journal of Chinese Instruments and Meters, and member of the Chinese Communist Party, Professor Wang Tianjuan, passed away in Beijing on February 20, 1989, at 6 PM due to illness. He was 77 years old.

Professor Wang Tianjuan was born in Huangyan, Zhejiang, in April 1912. He graduated from the Department of Physics at Tsinghua University in 1938 and obtained his Ph.D. from Columbia University in the United States in 1953. After returning to China in 1960, he worked at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan, where he held positions including research fellow, director of the research room, and director of the institute. He also served as vice-chairman of the Hubei Physical Society, member of the Hubei Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and representative of the Hubei Provincial People's Congress. Since 1981, he has been a research fellow at the Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Professor Wang Tianjuan participated in revolutionary movements and progressive organizations in his early years, including the December 9th Student Movement, the Society for the Study of Science, the Shanghai Anti-Imperialist League, and the National Salvation Vanguard. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1936.

Professor Wang Tianjuan dedicated his life to research in radio frequency and microwave spectroscopy, stimulated emission, quantum frequency standards, and atomic and molecular physics, making significant contributions. He participated in the initial experiments of the ammonia quantum amplifier, first measured the influence of the nuclear electric 16-pole moment on the electric 4-pole resonance spectrum line, and invented the signal feedback oscillator detection circuit (Wang Circuit), which was recognized by the spectroscopy community at that time.

Professor Wang Tianjuan loved his country and devoted his life to scientific research, nurturing a group of talents in spectroscopy and optics for the nation.
