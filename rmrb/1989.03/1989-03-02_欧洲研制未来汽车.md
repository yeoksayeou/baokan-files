The European Community's "Prometheus" project for developing cars in the 1990s has entered a decisive stage. Over the next four years, participating countries will allocate approximately 800 million marks (about $437 million) for this purpose.

The "Prometheus" project is part of the Eureka technological cooperation within the European Community. The plan envisages using the most advanced electronic technology to improve existing car equipment, enabling drivers to be aware of road conditions in a timely manner. For example, through optical and acoustic radar systems, drivers can be prepared for fog, ice, traffic accidents, and other dangerous situations in advance, preventing accidents before they happen. It is estimated that if drivers receive relevant information half a second earlier, traffic accidents can be reduced by 60%.

Federal Minister of Research Liselotte Funcke recently told the Bonn press that the Federal Republic of Germany will invest approximately 330 million marks (about $180 million) over the next four years, with the remaining amount to be shared by the other participating countries: France, Britain, Italy, and Sweden.

    欧洲研制未来汽车
    新华社波恩2月27日电　欧洲共同体研制90年代汽车的“普罗米修斯”计划已进入决定性阶段，今后4年参与研制的国家将为此拨款约8亿马克（合4.37亿多美元）资金。
    “普罗米修斯”计划是欧共体“尤里卡”科技合作的一个项目。计划设想采用最先进的电子技术改进现有的汽车装备，使驾驶员能及时了解路面情况。例如通过光学、声学的雷达系统，可使驾驶员对雾、冰、交通事故和其他危险情况及早作好准备，防患于未然。据估计，如果司机得到有关信息早半秒钟，交通事故可减少60％。
    联邦德国研技部长里森胡贝尔最近对波恩报界说，联邦德国今后4年将投资约3.3亿马克（合1.8亿多美元），余额将由此计划其余参与国法、英、意、瑞典分担。
