The Police Officer Painter
    – Impressions of Liu Wenliang
    By Lai Renqiong, People's Daily Reporter

    Liu Wenliang is the deputy director of the Public Security Bureau of Langfang, Hebei. His paintings, when exhibited at the China Art Museum in Beijing, caused a great stir. Some said that his paintings seemed to be written with an entire vat of ink and a full heart of emotion, with waves of ink blending with the sea of emotions, rolling and surging on the paper, like a great river rushing forward, flowing a thousand miles. After seeing them, I felt that this description was not exaggerated.

    People might wonder: Was it a painter who became a police officer, or a police officer who became a painter? In any case, both roles are united in Liu Wenliang.

    Indeed, Liu Wenliang is a genuine old public security officer. Since 1951, when he first put on his police uniform, he has been in the public security field. People are familiar with the thrilling and twisting stories of public security officers breaking cases, tracking down criminals, and capturing fugitives, but they rarely know how the passion of an artist flows through the veins of this police director. I entered a corner of the art gallery, and the taciturn Liu Wenliang told me about some things beyond his works.

    Liu Wenliang was born in a family of folk artists in Shifang Town, Ba County, Hebei. In his early years, his family was poor, and due to the turmoil of war, he did not receive a formal education. However, his father's artistic activities made Liu Wenliang, from a young age, absorb art through his ears and eyes. When he grew a little older, he followed his father to sell paintings and paper cuts to make a living. His painted gourds were very popular among the villagers. However, the war raged on, and the young Liu Wenliang had to put down his brush and join his father and brothers in the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation.

    Perhaps it was the hardships of displacement that left a deep impression, or perhaps it was the habit formed by his special job in public security, but without a stable environment, he often found himself drawing in his mind. Some of his works, although drawn on paper, he felt were still not up to his mental image, and he would immediately destroy them. Over the decades, he has drawn and destroyed countless pieces. By chance, a painter friend discovered his secret and was not only amazed by his talent but also astonished by his almost bizarre method of drawing and then destroying. His friends advised him, "You must keep your paintings!" Thus, there are today the unique works hanging in the art gallery.

    This police officer painter has neither a drawing board nor a studio to this day. Often, when the mood strikes, he spreads out paper and ink on the ground and starts painting. His subjects are diverse, from landscapes to birds and animals. He paints cats, bamboo, frogs, and lotuses the most. One painting, "With me here, rodents dare not act recklessly," not only depicts the majesty of a cat but also expresses the feelings of public security officers in maintaining social stability and being loyal to their duties.

    "My paintings are the expression of my inner self," said Liu Wenliang.

　　警官画家
    ——刘文梁印象
    本报记者  赖仁琼
    刘文梁是河北廊坊公安局副局长，他的画在北京中国美术馆展出时引起一片惊叹。有人说，他的画似用整缸的墨，满腔的情灌写出来的，墨浪交融着情海在纸上滚滚翻腾，仿如大河奔流，一泻千里。我看过之后，觉得这话并不过分。
    人们或许会问：到底是画家当了警官，还是警官成了画家？不管怎么说，反正两者统一在刘文梁身上了。
    确实，刘文梁是地地道道的老公安。从１９５１年穿上警服至今，一直吃公安这碗饭。人们熟知公安人员破案侦缉、追捕逃犯等惊险曲折的故事，却鲜知艺术家的激情怎样在这位公安局长的血管里奔流。我步入美术馆展厅一角，不善言辞的刘文梁向我讲述了他作品以外的一些事情。
    刘文梁出生在河北霸县胜芳镇一个民间艺人家里。幼时家贫，加之战乱，未能接受正规教育。但是，父亲的艺术活动使刘文梁从小耳濡目染，稍大他便随父亲卖画剪纸，以此糊口。他画的葫芦深得乡民喜爱。然而战火连连，少年刘文梁不得不放下画笔，跟随父兄投身抗日战争和解放战争。
    也许是饱受颠沛流离之苦打下的烙印，也许是从事公安这一特殊职业养成的习惯，没有安定的环境，便常常在脑子里作画。有的虽然画到纸上了，过不多久，他感到与心中的画相较仍有距离，立即毁掉。几十年里，他不知画了多少又毁了多少。一个偶然的机会，一位画家朋友发现了他的秘密，不仅惊喜于他的才情，更惊异于他画了又毁的近乎怪异的作法。朋友们劝他，一定要把画留下来！于是才有了今天挂在美术馆展出的那些独具风采的作品。
    这位警官画家至今既无画案更无画室。常常是情之所至，便在地上摊开纸墨，乘兴挥毫。他绘画题材广泛，从山川风物到鸟虫走兽。画得最多的是猫、竹、青蛙、荷花。一幅“有吾在此，鼠辈休想放肆”，既画出了猫的虎威又画出了公安人员维护社会安定、忠于事业的情感。
    “我的画是我内心的表白。”刘文梁如是说。
