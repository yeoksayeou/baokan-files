Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 23rd.

Deputies to the Seventh National People's Congress (NPC) continued to deliberate on the government work report today. Deputies analyzed the issues of economic overheating and excessive demand from various angles and discussed ways and measures to reduce social demand and increase effective supply.

Several dozen officials from various ministries and commissions of the State Council, including many ministers, attended the meetings of various deputy groups today to listen to opinions, provide information, and answer questions from the deputies. Starting today, the ministers will attend the meetings during the deliberation of the government work report.

Many deputies believe that the task of reducing the total fixed asset investment scale by 9.2 billion yuan this year, proposed by Li Peng in the government work report, is in line with China's current reality, but it is also a challenging task. The key now is to persistently implement it and ensure it is carried out effectively. Leaf Rutan, a deputy from Zhejiang, said that economic overheating is not a temporary issue but a result of errors in guiding ideology. To truly control economic overheating and excessive demand, strong measures are needed. There are macro-control targets, but often the corresponding means are lacking. Liu Shibai, a deputy from Sichuan, said that after half a year of rectification and adjustment, the situation of economic overheating, excessive demand, and market tension has eased somewhat, but the problems have not been fundamentally solved. The growth rate of township enterprises is still above 20%, and the investment enthusiasm of local governments and enterprises is still strong. In particular, there is still no spirit of preparing for a tight budget. He suggested strengthening the administrative functions and authority of the state, using economic means, and resolutely curbing the excessive total social demand.

Some deputies believe that while reform is necessary, the approach of "crossing the river by feeling the stones" taken in the past two years is correct, but it is also important to strengthen research in social sciences and enhance the scientific nature and foresight of decision-making. Wang Hongji, a deputy from the People's Liberation Army, believes that for major issues, there should not be only one voice or one plan. Especially, different opinions from all sides should be listened to, fully discussed, and the pros and cons weighed to reduce mistakes. Many deputies believe that eliminating the "overheating" phenomenon should be treated as a long-term task and not allowed to recur every few years.

Some deputies believe that the issue of economic overheating needs to be analyzed specifically. Liu Huixian, a deputy from Heilongjiang, said that for the current problems, it is not appropriate to simply blame high speed. The key is whether the speed is reasonable.

　　人大代表审议政府工作报告        
    探讨压缩社会总需求的良策
    据新华社北京３月２３日电  出席七届全国人大二次会议的各代表团今天继续审议政府工作报告。代表们从不同角度剖析了经济过热、需求过旺的问题，探讨了压缩社会需求、增加有效供给的途径和措施。
    包括许多部长在内的国务院各部、委的几十名负责干部，今天到各代表团听取意见，介绍情况并回答代表们的询问。从今天开始，部长们在审议政府工作报告期间都将列席会议。
    许多代表认为，李鹏在政府工作报告中提出的今年压缩全社会固定资产投资规模９２０亿元的任务是符合我国当前实际的，但是，这项任务也是艰巨的。现在的问题是如何坚持不懈地抓下去，使它落到实处。浙江代表团的叶如棠代表说，经济过热不是一时的问题，而是指导思想上失误造成的。要真正控制经济过热，需求过旺，必须要有强有力的措施。现在有宏观调控目标，但往往缺乏相应的手段。四川代表团的刘诗白代表说，治理整顿已过半年，经济过热、需求过旺、市场紧张的状况有所缓解，但问题没有根本解决，乡镇企业的增长速度还在２０％以上，地方政府和企业的投资冲动还很强烈，尤其是上下还没有一个过紧日子的精神准备。他建议强化国家的行政职能和权威，注意运用经济手段，把过大的社会总需求坚决压下去。
    一些代表认为，搞改革，前两年讲要摸着石头过河，这是对的，但也要加强社会科学理论研究，增强决策的科学性和预见性。解放军代表团的王宏济代表认为，对一些重大问题，不能只有一种声音，一种方案。特别要多听各方面不同的意见，充分论证，权衡利弊，减少失误。不少代表认为，应该把消除“过热”现象作为长期任务来抓，不要过几年再热一次。
    一些代表认为，对经济过热的问题需要具体分析。来自黑龙江的刘恢先代表说，对现在存在的问题，不能简单地怪高速度，关键是速度是否合理。
