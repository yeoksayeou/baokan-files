Kabul Requests Direct Talks with the U.S.
Soviet Media Reveals Situation in Kabul

Kabul, March 26 (Xinhua) - An official from the Kabul government of Afghanistan said on the 25th that they hope to hold direct talks with the United States and suggested that the U.S. send a delegation to visit Kabul to observe the actual situation in Afghanistan.

The official said that as a first step, the Kabul government hopes that the U.S. will send a delegation composed of senators and other individuals to visit Kabul to understand "our sincerity and determination in politically resolving the Afghan issue."

The official also suggested that the European Community assist in facilitating contact between Kabul and the U.S.

Moscow, March 25 (Xinhua) - According to today's reports in Soviet newspapers, the Afghan government army is taking measures to strengthen the defense of the capital, Kabul.

The newspaper Izvestia published a report from its correspondent in Kabul, stating that all government agencies in Afghanistan are guarded by armed soldiers, with armored personnel carriers stationed nearby. Most of the staff in these agencies have become soldiers. Out of the 90 staff members in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 70 have been deployed to guard the airport.

The report said that economic difficulties are evident throughout Kabul, with many disabled people and refugees from rural areas on the streets. The Soviet Union supplies 200 tons of flour to the city daily. Despite the hardships, Kabul does not give the impression of being under siege. The latest issue of the weekly Novoye Vremya quoted Soviet Deputy Defense Minister General Valenikov as saying that after the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the battlefield situation there has not changed significantly, and the government army has sufficient strength to control key cities.

However, in an article, Pravda quoted Kabul garrison commander General Mukhtar as saying that anti-government forces have obtained rockets with a range of 50 kilometers from the United States, and there is a possibility of attacks from all directions on Kabul.

　　喀布尔要求同美直接会谈        
    苏联报刊披露喀布尔现状
    新华社北京３月２６日电  喀布尔消息：阿富汗喀布尔政府官员２５日要求同美国直接会谈，并建议美派代表团访问喀布尔，考察阿富汗实际情况。
    这位官员说，作为第一步，喀布尔政府希望美国派出由参议员和其他人士组成的一个代表团访问喀布尔，以便了解“我们政治解决阿富汗问题的诚意和决心”。
    这位官员还建议欧洲共同体为促使喀布尔与美国接触提供帮助。
    新华社莫斯科３月２５日电据苏联报纸今天报道，阿富汗政府军正采取措施加强对首都喀布尔的防卫。
    《消息报》发表该报驻喀布尔记者的报道说，阿富汗政府机关都由荷枪实弹的士兵把守，附近停有装甲运兵车。大部分机关工作人员都成了战士。外交部９０个机关人员中有７０个去守卫机场。
    报道说，喀布尔市内经济困难随处可见，街上有许多残疾人和从农村逃出的难民。苏联运往该市仅面粉每天就达２００吨。尽管困难重重，但喀布尔还没有给人留下已被围攻的印象。最新一期的《新时代》周刊援引苏联国防部副部长瓦连尼科夫大将的话说，在苏联军队撤出阿富汗以后那里的战场形势没有发生大的变化，政府军有足够的力量控制着重要城镇。
    但是，《真理报》在一篇报道中援引喀布尔卫戍部队指挥员穆赫塔尔将军的话说，反政府军从美国方面得到了射程为５０公里的火箭炮弹，不排除从四面八方向喀布尔发动攻击的可能性。
