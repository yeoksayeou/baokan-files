Ren Jianxin, President of the Supreme People's Court, reported to the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress on the work of the Supreme People's Court, stating that fighting crime and maintaining social stability is a long-term, arduous, and complex task. The criminal adjudication work of the people's courts must be strengthened to ensure and promote the smooth progress of construction and reform.

Ren Jianxin said that in 1988, the people's courts at all levels across the country accepted 313,306 criminal cases, an increase of 8.2% over the previous year; concluded 312,475 cases, an increase of 7% over the previous year; and sentenced 368,790 defendants, an increase of 13% over the previous year. Overall, the courts across the country have timely and effectively cracked down on criminal activities, striking accurately.

He said that while social order is generally stable, there are still many problems and destabilizing factors. The situation remains quite severe. The number of major criminal cases accepted by the courts nationwide has increased significantly. Mobile criminals are rampant, and in large and medium-sized cities, transportation hubs, and coastal open areas, mobile criminals account for a significant proportion of all criminal cases, reaching over 50% in some places.

He said that in recent years, a notable issue in criminal cases is the increasing number of juvenile crimes. In 1988, among the convicted criminals, those who were 14 years old and above but under 18 years old accounted for 8.9%, an increase of 13.8% over the previous year. To strengthen the comprehensive treatment of juvenile delinquency, we propose that this year, according to needs and possibilities, in large and medium-sized cities and coastal open areas, basic-level people's courts and some intermediate people's courts should gradually establish juvenile criminal case collegial panels. We also hope that through legislation and improving judicial organizations and procedures, we can gradually perfect the judicial system for the rehabilitation of delinquent youth.

Ren Jianxin said that in 1988, the courts across the country accepted 55,180 economic crime cases, concluded 55,710 cases (including cases from the previous year), and sentenced 74,923 defendants. Overall, the courts across the country have seriously implemented the policy of severe punishment for serious economic crimes, adhering to the principles of being decisive, cautious, and accurate.

Ren Jianxin emphasized that criminal activities that endanger social stability and disrupt the economy, as a social phenomenon, will continue to exist in China's primary stage of socialism. Therefore, in the coming period, we must adhere to the policy of "one hand building, one hand enforcing the law." The state's dictatorial function must not be abandoned.

　　任建新向七届人大二次会议报告高法工作        
    社会治安基本稳定        
    面临形势相当严峻
    去年各级法院受理刑事案件三十一万三千多件，判处被告人三十六万八千多名
    新华社北京３月２９日电　最高人民法院院长任建新今天向七届全国人大二次会议报告最高人民法院工作时指出，同犯罪作斗争，稳定社会治安，是一项长期、艰巨和复杂的任务，人民法院的刑事审判工作必须加强，以保障、促进建设和改革的顺利进行。
    任建新说，１９８８年全国各级人民法院受理刑事案件３１３３０６件，比上年增加８．２％；审结３１２４７５件，比上年增加７％；判处被告人３６８７９０名，比上年增加１３％。总的来看，全国法院对犯罪活动的打击是及时的、有力的，打得准的。
    他说，当前全国社会治安基本稳定，但存在的问题和不安定因素仍然不少，我们面临的形势还是相当严峻的。全国法院受理的重大刑事案件大量增加。流窜犯很猖獗，在大中城市、交通干线和沿海开放地区，流窜犯作案在全部刑事案件中占很大的比重，有的地方高达５０％以上。
    他说，近几年来在刑事案件中值得注意的一个问题是青少年犯罪不断增多。１９８８年判处的罪犯中，１４岁以上不满１８岁的未成年人占８．９％，比上年增加１３．８％。为加强对少年犯罪的综合治理，我们提出今年要根据需要和可能，在大、中城市及沿海开放地区的基层人民法院和一部分中级人民法院，逐步建立未成年人刑事案件合议庭，并希望通过立法以及健全审判组织和程序，逐步完善矫治失足少年的司法制度。
    任建新说，１９８８年，全国法院受理的刑事案件中，有经济犯罪案件５５１８０件，审结５５７１０件（含上年未结案），判处被告人７４９２３名。从总体上看，全国法院对严重经济犯罪活动认真贯彻了依法从严惩处的方针，坚持了一要坚决、二要慎重、务必搞准的原则。
    任建新强调，危害社会治安和破坏经济的犯罪活动，作为一种社会现象，在我国社会主义初级阶段还会长期存在。因此，在今后一个相当长的时期里，必须坚持“一手抓建设、一手抓法制”的方针。国家的专政职能不能丢。
