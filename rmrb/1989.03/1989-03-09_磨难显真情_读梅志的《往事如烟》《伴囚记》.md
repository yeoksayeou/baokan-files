Every nation has its outstanding women.

I have always had a deep dislike for the Tsarist Russian regime, but I have always greatly admired the strong Russian women. It is not wrong to say that this admiration contains elements of affection. Respect and love have always been intertwined. The Russian women in Turgenev's works are always stronger than the men. They have strong characters, pure hearts, deep education, elegant manners, and a passion for life. They also possess a sublime spirit of self-sacrifice for their ideals. Examples include Nadezhda (_Rudin_), Elena (_On the Eve_), and the woman in _The Threshold_ who fearlessly presses on despite the danger of being crushed. Nekrasov's long poem _Russian Women_ also describes the wives of the Decembrists in a similar vein. When their husbands were suppressed by the Tsar for the cause of Russian liberation and exiled to the icy wilderness of Siberia, these women abandoned their noble status and luxurious lives, resolutely embarking on a long and arduous journey to Siberia to find their husbands. Every time I read these works, I feel a pure and holy warmth flowing from the lines of the book, straight into the depths of my heart.

From Mei Zhi's two memoirs, _Smoke of the Past_ and _Imprisoned Together_, I not only saw the image of an upright intellectual who stood by her convictions and feared no persecution, but also the figure of a strong woman from our nation. Great personal tragedies reveal extraordinary character. In 1955, the "Hu Feng Counter-Revolutionary Clique" case, which shocked the world, occurred. From the wrongful imprisonment in 1955 to the liberation in 1979, the more than 20 years of imprisonment and spiritual torment added a deep and tragic warrior-like hue to the life journey and love life of this couple who endured hardships together.

Mei Zhi's writing is straightforward. She recounts the unforgettable days and nights she spent with Hu Feng, her heart's pain and joy, love and hatred. Yet all these emotions are expressed so simply, so deeply, so resiliently, revealing the character of a refined, elegant, and deeply emotional Chinese intellectual woman. At the same time, they contrast beautifully with Hu Feng's rugged, unyielding, and fiery masculine character. The many small details recorded in the book, though written casually, are all imbued with profound thoughts and emotions, making the reader moved and touched. In _Smoke of the Past_, she writes about the scene when she met her husband, whom she had not seen for ten years. The strong, silent, yet powerful handshake, the wordless, long gaze—wave after wave of sadness washed over my heart. In _Imprisoned Together_, she recounts a small incident: In a labor reform tea plantation in Sichuan, one day, "I suddenly saw a branch of early-blooming white tea flowers, two blooms side by side. This reminded me of 1942 spring in Guangdong, where the guerrilla base was surrounded by tea trees blooming with similar white tea flowers. At that time, F (referring to Hu Feng) specially picked one that was also double-bloomed and gave it to me. Now, I picked the flower and happily handed it to him, hoping to evoke pleasant memories to make him feel better. But he took the flower and only glanced at it with a sad expression."

During the period when Hu Feng was ill and bedridden, she noticed that her husband's sleeping face had a "serene, peaceful beauty," and her heart trembled: "Don't leave me like this! No, I can't let you go before me! You still have so much to do, so much to say.... You can't leave this world with this unjust accusation.... You must live on!" She wrote a short poem in her heart—“Great mountains and small mountains press on your shoulders” “Don't kneel / Don't fall”—expressing her will. In the face of great adversity, as a wife, she did not complain or leave her husband, but stood firm. She deeply understood her husband's character and mission. She wanted to stand by her husband: "All illusions have been shattered. I will face reality and go with F towards the unknown 'future'!" She went to prison with her husband for another six years. Only a woman with rare insight, willpower, and integrity could do this. Hu Feng was right: "As long as we are together, we are a family. With you, I have everything." The strength and warmth of a tenacious woman are often the most important factors for a steadfast scholar's success.

These are two heavy, blood-and-tear-written little books. From them, we glimpse the sublime flower of love nurtured by two strong hearts with blood.

　　磨难显真情
    ——读梅志的《往事如烟》《伴囚记》
    孙乃修
    每个民族都有自己杰出的女性。
    我对沙皇俄国素来厌恶，然而对坚强的俄罗斯女性却一向极敬佩，说起这种敬佩含有爱慕也不妨。因为敬与爱向来是相伴而生的。屠格涅夫笔下的俄罗斯女性，总比男性强，她们性格坚强、心灵纯真、教养深厚、举止优雅，对生活充满热情，并且有着为理想而献身的崇高精神，娜达丽亚（《罗亭》）、叶琳娜（《前夜》）以及《门槛》中那位不怕粉身碎骨而勇往直前的女郎，就是极好的例子。涅克拉索夫写的长诗《俄罗斯妇女》描写的十二月党人妻子也是如此。她们把夫妻间深挚、纯真的爱和对真理的追求融为一体，把伟大的爱情和为事业而献身的崇高牺牲精神结合在一起。在她们的丈夫为俄国的解放事业而遭到沙皇镇压、被流放到冰天雪地的西伯利亚时，她们抛弃了自己的贵族地位和豪华生活，毅然踏上充满艰难的漫漫征途，去西伯利亚寻找自己的丈夫。每当读到这些作品，都感到有一股圣洁的热流从书的字里行间流溢出来，一直流进心灵深处。
    从胡风夫人梅志的两本追忆往事的书《往事如烟》和《伴囚记》中，我不仅看到了一个坚持自己信念、不畏迫害的正直知识分子的性格形象，而且也看到了我们民族的一位坚强女性的身影。重大的人生灾难能见出非凡的人格。１９５５年出现了震动中外的“胡风反革命集团”案件。从１９５５年冤狱铸成到１９７９年获得解放，漫长的２０余年囹圄生活和精神磨难为这对患难夫妻的人生历程和爱情生活增添了浓厚悲壮的战士色彩。
    梅志的文笔是平实的。她记述了和胡风一起度过的那些难忘的日日夜夜，记述了自己心灵的痛苦和喜悦、爱与憎，然而所有这些感情的表述又都是那么朴实，那么深沉，那么柔韧，显示出一位温文优雅、情感深挚的中国知识分子女性的性格，同时又与胡风那种嵚崎磊落、刚强不阿、勃然大怒的男子汉性格形成绝妙的对照。书中记述的许多细节小事虽然都是信笔淡淡写来，但却都浸透着深刻的思想情感，读来令人感动，令人恻然。《往事如烟》中写到与离别十年的丈夫相见时的情景，那强忍住感情、静静然而有力的握手、无言的久久对望，一缕缕悲哀袭上我的心头。《伴囚记》写了这样一件小事：在四川的劳改茶场，有一天，“我忽然看到了一枝早开的白色小茶花，还是两朵并蒂的。这使我忆起了１９４２年春在广东东江游击队住的山寮附近也有几丛茶树正开着这样白色的小茶花，Ｆ（指胡风）那时还特意采了一朵也是这样的双双开在一起的小花送给我。现在，我将花采下，很高兴地递给他，想唤起美好的回忆来使他心情愉快些。但他接过花，只淡淡地用忧伤的眼神望着它。”在胡风患病卧床期间，她发现丈夫的睡容有“静穆的、安详的美”，心里一阵发颤：“可别这样离我而去啊！不，我决不能让你比我先走！你还有许多事要做，你还有许多话要说。……你不能带着这不白之冤，轻易地离开人世呀！……你要活下来！我不敢抱着他痛哭，只有坐在他身旁饮泣。”她信笔写下小诗——“大山小山压在你的肩上”“别屈膝／别倒下”——中，表达自己的意志。大难临头，作为妻子，她不是埋怨或离开丈夫，而是坚强地挺住。她深知丈夫的人格和事业，她要和丈夫站在一起：“一切幻想都破灭了。我将面对现实，和Ｆ一起奔向未知的‘前程’！”她同丈夫一同又去坐了六年牢。这只有极少有慧眼、有意志、有操守的女性才能做到。胡风说得很对：“只要我们在一起，就是一个家。有你，我就有了一切。”一位坚韧的女性，她的力量和温暖，往往正是一位不屈的志士赖以成功的最重要因素之一。
    这是两本用血和泪写成的沉甸甸的小书。从这里，我们窥见两颗坚强的心灵用血浇灌出来的崇高的爱情之花。
