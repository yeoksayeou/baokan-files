		Film "Half Flame, Half Sea Water" Warned Over Plot Involving Relevant Departments

		According to a report from our newspaper, the Beijing Film Studio adapted Wang Shuo's novel of the same name into the film "Half Flame, Half Sea Water." Due to a nude scene, the film has recently been given a "yellow card warning" by the relevant departments involved in the plot.

		This film delves into the complex souls of several modern urban youths. The so-called nude scene is actually more like a half-revealed pose, showing at most the back of the female actor. The love-making scene between the male and female leads only shows the back of the male actor and the female actor's neck and above, and is quite restrained.

		The film is directed by the middle-aged director Xia Gang. After screening the film for dozens of film experts, he told the inquirers: "This is the complete film, uncut. Based on the review opinions, we plan to make some edits." An official from the Film Bureau believes that this film has not "violated the rules." Some experts have noted that this film is very meticulous and refined in its artistry, with distinctive features in cinematography and music.

　　因影片情节涉及有关部门
    《一半是火焰一半是海水》受警告
    本报讯  北影厂根据王朔同名小说改编拍摄的影片《一半是火焰一半是海水》，因有裸戏，日前被影片情节中涉及到的有关部门“黄牌警告”。
    这部影片着力展示几个现代都市青年的复杂灵魂。所谓裸戏，其实是犹抱琵琶半遮面，顶多呈现了女演员的背部而已。男女主人公的做爱场面，也仅仅拍到男演员的背和女演员的颈项以上，还是十分克制的。
    该片是中年导演夏钢拍的。作品给几十位电影行家放过之后，他告诉询问者：“这是全片，未删减过。根据审查意见，准备动点剪刀。”电影局的一位官员认为此片并没有“犯规”。一些行家注意到，此片艺术上很讲究很细致，摄影、音乐都有自己的特色。
