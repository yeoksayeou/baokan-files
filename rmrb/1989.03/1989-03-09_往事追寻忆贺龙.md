Fifty years ago, the people of northern Shanxi called Comrade He Long the "Living Dragon." This was because after he led the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army to northern Shanxi, he governed wisely, and the weather was favorable, thus earning this praise.

Comrade He Long dedicated his life to the Party and the country, leaving a legacy that will be remembered in history. He was brave and fearless, frank and generous. It was precisely because of his distinctive and unique personality that his revolutionary achievements shone even brighter, and many legendary stories about him circulated among the people. This article only records some trivial incidents from my interactions with him, as a tribute to my sorrow for him. From these trivial memories, one can also glimpse his character and demeanor.

(1) Comrade He Long was a person of strong party spirit. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, Comrade He Long went to northern Shanxi, while I went to southeastern Shanxi. Although we were separated by mountains and rivers, I often heard about his situation. He was not only good at leading troops and fighting, but also had a firm proletarian party spirit. He often said that party spirit is not an abstract thing, but must be reflected in one's daily words and deeds. He called the people's army the "Party Army," meaning that the army must follow the leadership of the Party and fight for the liberation of the Chinese people. It should not be like the warlords, turning the army into a tool for personal and a few people's private interests. Comrade He Long came from the old army, so he had a particularly deep understanding of the nature of the people's army. He often educated his subordinates that northern Shanxi was a shield for the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region and a channel for the Party Central Committee to communicate with other base areas, with important strategic significance. The Party Central Committee sent us here, and we must take root here. He had a famous saying: "A person cannot be without a head, and a party and an army cannot be without a head." This head is the Party Central Committee led by Comrade Mao Zedong. At any time, we must maintain this head. During the stalemate phase of the Anti-Japanese War, due to the enemy's blockade, the material life in various base areas was extremely difficult, and northern Shanxi was no exception. Many soldiers still did not have winter clothes by winter. Even in such circumstances, the Jin-Sui Base Area led by Comrade He Long, like other anti-Japanese base areas, first thought of supporting the Party Central Committee, sending the limited materials produced by their own troops to Yan'an. He said, "The Central Committee has difficulties, which are our difficulties. At any time, we must not forget the overall situation and must first help the Central Committee overcome difficulties." He was always putting the interests of the Party above his personal interests and the overall interests above local interests. As Comrade Ren Bishi said, "The greatness of Comrade He Long lies in his consistent loyalty to the revolution and the Party."

(2) First Meeting. The time was autumn 1943. I went from Shanxi to Yan'an to prepare for the Seventh National Congress of the Party. Due to the postponement of the conference, several of us who returned from the front line requested to participate in the Rectification Movement, which was approved by the Central Committee. We immediately entered the Central Party School, and I was assigned to the first branch of the school. Comrade He Long was then the commander-in-chief of the Five Provinces Joint Defense Army of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Jin-Sui, living in Yan'an. One day, I went with Comrade Luo Ronghuan to visit him. He was very enthusiastic and, with a strong Xiangxi accent, said: "Welcome, welcome! Comrade Yibao, although we are meeting for the first time, we were both in the Shanxi anti-Japanese base area, and your name has been familiar to me for a long time. This is your first time in Yan'an, and you must have many inconveniences. If you have any difficulties, please tell me." He immediately instructed the surrounding comrades to make a set of clothes for me and Luo Ronghuan. He said, "Other items have been arranged by the Central Committee, and things produced by ourselves, such as milk and fruits, you will all have." The first meeting made me feel that he was a frank and generous person. At that time, whether in Yan'an or in the front-line anti-Japanese base areas, mutual care and concern between comrades and between superiors and subordinates were prevalent. This comradeship and moral ethos were an important source of strength for the revolutionary army to unite and overcome various difficulties and achieve continuous victories.

(3) At the bedside of Comrade Guan Xiangying. In December 1943, Comrade Guan Xiangying was hospitalized for treatment of tuberculosis. One day, when I went to visit him, Comrade He Long happened to be there. Seeing me, he asked: "How is it, Yibao? Do you know Xiaoguan (he always called Xiangying by this name)?" I replied, "Yes, we have known each other for a long time. In the summer of 1930, Comrade Xiangying worked at the Central Military Commission and came to the north to inspect the development of military work. At that time, I was working at the Military Commission of the North China Bureau of the Communist Party, and he visited Tianjin and Tangshan, both of which were accompanied by me. We got along very well, especially his Marxist theoretical cultivation, which left a deep impression on me." Then, Guan Xiangying slowly and softly said: "Comrade Yibao has been engaged in military work for a long time and has developed party organizations in several divisions of the Jin army. His work is very good, and he has rich experience." Comrade He Long nodded and smiled: "I am ignorant! It turns out that you have been a military worker for a long time. That's even more worthy of respect." He continued, "We are like this. The Party arranges for us to do whatever it needs. Military work, party and government work, mass work, and underground work, all need to be done. This is good for tempering oneself and increasing one's abilities. 'Practice makes perfect, practice makes talent.' Our party cadres, including all aspects of cadres who can really shoulder heavy responsibilities, are all tempered and grown through practice. This is the case now, and it will still be the case after the revolution is successful. The ancient saying 'Prime ministers rise from the provinces, and generals emerge from the ranks' probably contains this meaning!"

(4) Reflecting on the "Rectification" in Xiang-E-West Hubei. This is something he talked about when I asked him about the situation in Xiang-E-West Hubei. He said: "In the 'Rectification' in the Soviet area, Xiang-E-West Hubei was the most 'leftist' and suffered the heaviest losses. Under the command of Xia Xian, four 'Rectifications' were carried out. Many comrades were labeled as 'Reorganizationists,' 'Anti-Internationalists,' and 'Counter-revolutionaries,' and were cruelly killed. Among them, more than ten high-ranking officers such as Wan Tao, Liu Kemin, and Duan Dechang were killed. Clearly knowing that they were all good comrades, but their lives could not be saved. When Xia Xian accused Duan Dechang of being a 'Reorganizationist' and wanted to kill him, I could no longer bear it and stood up to argue with him fiercely, but it was to no avail. When Duan Dechang was killed, he looked at me and cried out, 'He Long, I do not oppose you, I only oppose Xia Xian! Do not forget the people of Honghu, and you must fight back to Honghu.' This bloody lesson, I will never forget it."

When he said this, Comrade He Long could no longer control his indignation. He raised his voice and said: "Why did such an extremely 'leftist' and excessive struggle and internal strife occur within the Party? The reasons are complex, involving factionalism, line struggles, and personal character issues. And Xia Xian had serious problems in all three aspects!" I said: "Not only Xia Xian did such stupid things, and not only did they occur in Xiang-E-West Hubei." He continued: "Now it's good. Comrade Mao Zedong is in charge of the Party Central Committee, and the Party's life is more democratic than before. It seems that we probably will not repeat such mistakes in the future." However, wishes are just wishes. He never imagined that 30 years later, it was precisely during the "Cultural Revolution" initiated by Comrade Mao Zedong that he himself was persecuted to death and did not escape the disaster. Of course, it was not just Comrade He Long; it can be said that none of us comrades expected such a serious "Ten Years of Chaos." History once again left us with a heavy lesson.

(5) "Speak out if you have opinions." One day in 1944, Comrade He Long invited me to go hunting in the wilderness and rest for a while. On the way, he asked me, "What do you think about a recent incident?" I asked him what incident, and he said, "It's about taking a ride in an American plane!" It turned out he was referring to an incident where a high-ranking leader of the Central Committee took a ride in an American military observation plane and flew a few circles over Yan'an. Then, he spoke quite excitedly about his views: "Since they call it the American Military Observation Group, stationed in Yan'an, it is to observe us. We also need to observe them, and according to international etiquette, we should have friendly exchanges with them, which is no problem. But what is the need to take a ride in their plane? Such a thing happening to a high-ranking responsible comrade, I think it is too indiscreet, really a mess! What kind of influence will this have on the Party? I will raise this issue at the Central Committee meeting. If you have opinions, you should speak out directly, and if there is something to criticize, you should criticize it, no matter who it happens to. You absolutely cannot avoid speaking out just because someone is a high-ranking official, and keep it secret. I think that in the political life of the Party, especially among high-ranking cadres, we should maintain the spirit of daring to speak out. The ancients even advocated 'pointing out mistakes to one's face,' if we cannot do this, what kind of communists are we!" I did not comment on the incident he mentioned because I was not familiar with the situation, but I appreciated his spirit of speaking out. I think his remarks at that time were thought-provoking, and today this spirit of speaking out is still worth learning and carrying forward.

(6) A long discussion on the exchange of views on cadres. After liberation, Comrade He Long served as the vice chairman of the Southwest Military and Political Commission and the commander of the Southwest Military Region, and we had fewer opportunities to meet. In June 1950, the Seventh Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee was held, and everyone gathered in Beijing. At that time, I was the first secretary of the North China Bureau and naturally should fulfill the duty of a "host," inviting several comrades from the Central Bureau to my home, and Comrade He Long also came. I remember that during our conversation, in addition to expressing the joy of building the country and our respective work situations, we also talked about our views on some cadres. The topic returned to the Anti-Japanese War period.

Comrade He Long said, "The 120th Division arrived in northern Shanxi, and the work was carried out smoothly, which is inseparable from the work that the comrades of the Sacrifice and Salvation Alliance and the Death-Defying Squad had done there before. Whether it was the Fourth Death-Defying Brigade, the Labor and Defense Brigade, the Temporary First Division, or the Second Death-Defying Brigade that later moved from southwestern Shanxi to northern Shanxi, they all united and cooperated well with the 120th Division." I asked him, "What do you think of the cadres of the Sacrifice and Salvation Alliance and the Death-Defying Squad there?" He asked me in return, "There are a few cadres who are controversial. Why do you still use them?" I explained to him, "When the Party Central Committee and the North China Bureau sent me to Shanxi to carry out united front work, they repeatedly instructed that we could 'wear Shanxi hats' and 'speak Shanxi dialect.' This form is special, but it is beneficial to us. As long as they advocate resistance against Japan, especially those around Yan Xishan, the more we unite, the broader and the better. When I was commissioned to build the new Shanxi army, it was at a time when the Yanmen Pass was lost, the Jin army retreated, and Yan Xishan felt helpless, that is, when people said he was at his most progressive, he told me through Liang Hua that Mr. Yan had an idea: whether the political commissars of the five divisions (that is, the four Death-Defying Brigades and the Labor and Defense Brigade) should be held by people from Shanxi would be better, so it would be easier to say to Mr. Jiang. The cadres you mentioned were arranged in this situation, and later they were also reported to the North China Bureau (at that time, the Shanxi Public Work Committee only did open work, and the party organizations within the Sacrifice and Salvation Alliance and the Death-Defying Squad were responsible for the Shanxi Temporary Work Committee). After eight years of anti-Japanese war and three years of liberation war, these comrades have all performed well. When I reported this work to the Party Central Committee, Comrade Mao Zedong basically made a summary, saying: 'Your work is done well, using a few people to unite the majority, which is very good, this is a success of the Party's united front, a special form.' Comrade He Long did not say anything after hearing this.

I then asked him, "What do you think of Comrade Niu Yincan?" He said, "Niu Yincan, as the deputy director of the Jin-Sui Administrative Office, performed poorly. His family is a landlord, and during the land reform, he was not firm in his stance when fighting his father." I immediately said, "Comrade He, please allow me to speak frankly. I think your view is wrong. You seem to lack a comprehensive understanding of him. Niu Yincan was originally a student at Tsinghua University and an active participant in the 'December 9th' Movement. Later, he was sent by the Party to work in Shanxi. According to the opinions of Comrade Liu Shaoqi and the North China Bureau, I focused on military work after fully entering it, and Niu Yincan took charge of the daily affairs of the Sacrifice and Salvation Alliance (when I met Comrade Zhu De in the Taihang area, he suggested that I take the new Shanxi army regiment and try to get Yan Xishan's approval to move to the Shangdang area. He also told me that you should focus on military work, and someone else should take over the Sacrifice and Salvation Alliance). I think he has made at least two major contributions. First, when organizing the county self-defense teams, Yan Xishan issued 5,000 rifles and more than 200 light machine guns, and through his efforts, these weapons were basically in the hands of Communist Party members. Second, before Yan Xishan launched the 'December Incident,' he promptly withdrew more than 400 cadres, preserving the Party's strength. His father was an enlightened gentleman and had also done some good things for us. I think there were 'leftist' errors in the land reform in Jin-Sui (we also had some), and it was not appropriate to fight his father. Especially using iron wire to pierce the old man's nose and let Niu Yincan lead him, making him 'graze,' this excessive behavior is extremely inhumane. Therefore, it is not appropriate to blame Comrade Niu Yincan for 'poor performance' and 'unfirm stance.'"

I have a flaw: once I start arguing, as long as I think I have some reason, it is not easy for me to accept others' opinions. Then, I asked him another question: "Comrade He, in your opinion, are there any good cadres among the cadres of the Death-Defying Squad in Jin-Sui?" He said, "How could there not be? The cadres of the Sacrifice and Salvation Alliance and the Death-Defying Squad are all good. Han Jun is one of them. This person is very capable and also writes good articles." I said, "Yes. Han Jun was the director of the political department of the Second Death-Defying Brigade and was actually in full charge. Later, he also served as your secretary. I have had a long and deep relationship with him. Of course, it is not to say that he has no flaws. For example, being a bit arrogant is one of his flaws."

In summary, this conversation was very frank, with both consensus and differences, but the mood was very pleasant. I gained several insights from it: First, it is not easy to judge people. For the same cadre, due to different angles and methods of observation, different lengths and depths of contact, and different environments, opinions often differ, and praise and criticism are common; second, therefore, in evaluating, assessing, and appointing cadres, it is necessary to widely solicit the opinions of everyone, and then analyze and distinguish them to obtain a more comprehensive and true understanding. Especially for cadres who are more familiar and close to oneself, it is more important to listen to others' opinions and not to think that one's own views are so accurate and reliable; third, leaders are also promoted from ordinary party members, and it is inevitable that there will be biases and distortions in judging people and things, and there will be inconsistencies in understanding, so it is necessary to exchange views frequently to eliminate differences and unify understanding. These insights were very helpful to my later work, especially in handling cadre appointments.

(7) Regarding stopping the construction of "Big Roofs." After three years of economic recovery, the country entered large-scale economic construction. At this time, some places began to show off, pursue luxury, and waste money. For example, in the construction of houses, Beijing, Changchun, Xi'an, Chongqing, Anshan, and other places started a trend of building "Big Roof" buildings. The so-called "Big Roof" is to add a palace-style roof to modern buildings. Indeed, architects designed such houses, which belong to a school of architectural art and style, and there is nothing wrong with that. When conditions permit, it is not inappropriate to build some in public places. The problem is that pursuing formal beauty one-sidedly, without considering whether economic conditions permit, and without looking at whether it is practical, universally promoting it, and building all kinds of houses in this way, it is inevitable that it becomes a bit absurd. I remember that at that time, Beijing built 39 "Big Roof" buildings, wasting a lot. The Changchun Geological Institute built a "Geological Palace," with a coiled dragon and carved beams and pillars, and the construction cost exceeded the budget by 50%. The "Four Departments and One Committee" building in Sanlitun, Beijing, also wanted to imitate it. I said, "This roof can only be seen by birds, spending a lot more money, and there is one less floor that cannot be used." Due to the intervention of Comrade Li Fuchun and me, the plan to build a "Big Roof" for the State Planning Commission was canceled, and this matter was supported by Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. At that time, I was the chairman of the National Production and Saving Commission, and Comrade Mao Zedong asked me to issue an order in the name of the Central Committee to immediately stop the trend of building "Big Roofs." Comrade He Long strongly supported this. He said, "The Central Committee's decision is correct, and we must firmly implement it. There is no room for negotiation, and whoever does not implement it will be held accountable!" He also personally arranged for the "Sichuan Daily" to publish an article, widely propagating it. Like many old revolutionaries, Comrade He Long had experienced many hardships and deeply understood the difficulty of creation, and he was naturally very resolute in opposing extravagance and waste. The trend of building "Big Roofs" was able to be quickly stopped, first because the Central Committee discovered it in time and made a decisive decision to correct it, and second because the actions of various places were consistent and could be enforced. I think this is also a successful experience to be learned from. As the saying goes, "Bad winds should not be allowed to spread!" This is something everyone understands. However, the way to stop the wind is to do it when it is just beginning to sprout and has not yet spread. This cannot be ignored.

In searching for the past, the intention is to look forward. Not forgetting the revolutionary achievements and revolutionary spirit of the departed, drawing lessons from them, and striving forward, to better open up the future of socialism, this should be the best memorial for Comrade He Long and all revolutionary predecessors.

　　往事追寻忆贺龙
    薄一波
    ５０年前，晋西北的老百姓称贺龙同志为“活龙”。因为他率八路军一二○师进驻晋西北后，治理有方，风调雨顺，故而得此称颂。
    贺龙同志为党为国毕生奋斗，功垂史册。他骁勇过人，坦诚豪爽，正是由于他这种鲜明、独特的个性，使他的革命业绩倍生光彩，在群众中流传着许多脍炙人口的传奇故事。本文仅记述我同他交往中的一些琐事，以寄托我对他的哀思。从这些琐忆之中，也能窥识他的人品与风范。
    （一）贺龙同志是个党性很强的人。抗战初，贺龙同志到晋西北时，我去了晋东南。虽山水相隔，但关于他的情况，时有所闻。他不但善于带兵打仗，而且有坚定的无产阶级党性。他常说，党性不是抽象的东西，而是要体现在日常的一言一行之中。他把人民的军队称之为“党军”。就是说，军队必须服从党的领导，必须为中国人民的解放事业奋斗。而不能像军阀那样，把部队变成为个人和少数人谋私利的工具。贺龙同志是从旧军队中走过来的，因而对于人民军队的性质认识得特别深切。他时常教育自己的部下，晋西北是陕甘宁边区的屏障，是党中央与其他根据地取得联系的通道，具有重要的战略地位。党中央派我们来到这里，我们就要在这里扎下根来。他有一句名言：人不能没有自己的头，一个党、一个军队也不能没有自己的头。这个头就是以毛泽东为首的党中央，任何时候我们都要维护好这个头。在抗战的相持阶段，由于敌人的封锁，各根据地物质生活极端困难，晋西北也同样，不少战士到了冬天尚无御寒的棉衣。即使在这种情况下，贺龙同志领导的晋绥根据地同其他抗日根据地一样，首先想到的是支援党中央，把自己部队生产的有限物资送往延安。他说，中央有困难，就是我们的困难，任何时候，我们不能忘记全局，不能忘记应该首先帮助中央克服困难。他就是这样，总是把党的利益置于个人利益之上，把全局利益置于局部利益之上。正如任弼时同志所说，贺龙同志的伟大之处，“在于他对革命、对党的一贯忠诚”。
    （二）第一次见面。时间在１９４３年秋天。当时我从山西去延安，准备参加党的七大，因会期推迟，我们从前方回去的几位同志要求先参加整风运动，得到中央批准，随即都进入中央党校，我编在党校第一支部。贺龙同志时任陕甘宁晋绥五省联防军司令员，住在延安。有一天，我同罗瑞卿同志去拜访他。他对我们非常热情，操着浓厚的湘西口音说：欢迎欢迎！一波同志，我们虽是初次相识，但我们同在山西抗日根据地，你的名字早就熟悉了。你初次来延安，一定有很多不便吧，有什么困难尽管对我说。他当即吩咐周围的同志，要给我和罗瑞卿同志每人做一套衣服。他说，其他用品中央已有安排，自己动手生产的东西，如牛奶、水果，你们都会有的。第一次见面，就使我感到，他是个开诚相见、厚以待人的人。那个时候，无论是延安还是前方抗日根据地，同志之间、上下级之间，互相关心、互相体贴蔚然成风。这种同志关系和道德风尚，正是革命队伍团结一致、同心同德地渡过各种难关和不断取得胜利的重要力量源泉。
    （三）在关向应同志病榻前。１９４３年１２月间，关向应同志因患肺病住院治疗。一天我去看望时，恰巧贺龙同志也来了。他见我便问：怎么，一波，你认识小关（他一直是这么称呼向应同志的）？我回答说：是啊，我们早就相识了。１９３０年的夏天，向应同志在中央军事委员会工作，到北方来巡视军事工作的开展情况。我当时在中共顺直省委军委工作，他到天津、唐山等地都是由我陪同的。我们相处很好，特别是他的马克思主义理论修养，给我留下深刻印象。接着，关向应同志缓慢而低声地说：一波同志很早就从事军运工作，在晋军几个师中都发展了党的组织，工作得很好，经验丰富。贺龙同志颔首笑道：恕我寡闻！原来你早就是军事工作者，那更当刮目相看了。他接着说：我们这些人就是这样，党安排什么就干什么。军事工作、党政工作、群众工作、地下工作，都需要去做，这对锻炼自己，增长才干，也很有好处。“实践出真知，实践出人才”。我们党的干部，包括各个方面真正能担当重任的干部，都是从实践中锻炼、成长起来的。现在是这样，将来革命成功以后也还会是这样。古人所说的“宰相起于州部，猛将发于卒伍”，大概也包含这个意思吧！
    （四）回顾湘鄂西的“肃反”。这是一次我问他在湘鄂西的斗争情形时谈起来的。他说：在苏区“肃反”中，湘鄂西是搞得最“左”、损失最惨重的一个。在夏曦的指挥下，前后进行了四次“肃反”。许多同志被扣上“改组派”、“反国际”、“反革命”的帽子，惨遭杀害。其中师以上的干部就有万涛、柳克明、段德昌等１０余人。明明知道他们都是好同志，但就是救不了他们的命。当夏曦以“改组派”的罪名要杀害段德昌同志时，我实在忍无可忍，拍案而起，同他激烈争辩，可还是无济于事。段德昌同志被害时，他望着我失声痛哭，并高声喊道：贺胡子，我不反对你，我只反对夏曦！你不要忘记洪湖人民，一定要打回洪湖去。这个血的教训，我是永远也忘不了的。
    讲到这里，贺龙同志已无法控制自己的激愤情绪，他提高嗓音说道：为什么党内会发生这样“左”得出奇的过火斗争和内耗事件？原因很复杂，有宗派问题，有路线问题，也有个人品质问题。而夏曦在这三个方面都有严重问题！我说：干这种蠢事的何止一个夏曦，又何止是在湘鄂西发生过。接着他说：现在好了，毛泽东同志主持党中央工作，党内生活比过去民主多了。看来，今后大概不致　再重蹈这样的覆辙了。但是，愿望毕竟是愿望。他万万没有想到，时过３０年之后，正是在毛泽东同志发动的“文化大革命”中，他自己也被迫害致死，而未能幸免于难。当然，不只是贺龙同志，可以说我们所有的同志都未曾料到会发生这样严重的“十年内乱”。历史又一次给我们留下了沉重的教训。
    （五）“有意见就要直言不讳”。１９４４年的一天，贺龙同志约我去野外打猎，稍事休息。途中，他问我，你对最近发生的一件事怎么看？我问他什么事，他说，就是坐着美国人的飞机兜风啊！原来他指的是中央一位领导人乘坐美军观察组的飞机在延安上空转了几圈的事。接着，他比较激动地讲了自己的看法：人家既然叫美军观察组，驻到延安，就是来观察我们的。我们也要观察他们，按照国际礼仪，同他们友好交往，这是没有问题的。可是有什么必要坐着他们的飞机去兜风？这样的事情发生在一位高级负责同志身上，我看太不检点，真是乱弹琴！这对党的影响好吗？中央开会时，我还要当面提出。有意见就要直言不讳，该批评的事就要批评，不管它发生在谁身上，绝不可因为官大就避而不讲，讳莫如深。我觉得，在党内特别是高级干部的政治生活中，应该保持敢于直言的正气。古人尚且主张“面折其过”，如果我们都做不到这一点，还叫什么共产党人！对于贺龙同志讲的这件事，我因不了解情况，当时未予置评，但我赞赏他的直抒己见的精神。我以为他的这番议论在当时是有思而发的，在今天这种直言不讳的精神仍是值得我们学习和发扬的。
    （六）一次就干部问题交换看法的长谈。解放初，贺龙同志担任西南军政委员会副主席、西南军区司令员，我们见面的机会不多。１９５０年６月召开党的七届三中全会，大家齐集北京。我当时是华北局的第一书记，自然应尽“地主”之谊，分别请了几个中央局的同志到家里作客，贺龙同志也来了。记得在同他交谈中，除了畅叙建国的喜悦心情和各自的工作情况，还谈到对一些干部的看法。话题又回到抗战时期。
    贺龙同志说，一二○师到了晋西北，工作开展得很顺利，这同牺盟会、决死队的同志先前在那里进行的工作是分不开的。无论是决死四纵队、工卫旅、暂一师，还是后来由晋西南转移到晋西北的决死二纵队，同一二○师都团结、配合得很好。我问他：你对牺盟会、决死队在那里的干部怎么看？他反问我：有几个干部是有争议的，你为什么还要用？我向他解释说：党中央和北方局派我到山西开展统一战线工作时，曾反复指示，可以“戴山西帽子”、“说山西话”，这种形式是特别的，但对我们有利。凡是主张抗日的人，特别是阎锡山周围的人，团结得越多越广泛越好。在委任我组建山西新军时，是正值雁门关失守，晋军溃退，阎锡山感到无可奈何的时候，也就是人们所说的他表现最进步的时期，他经过梁化之转告我说，阎先生有个想法，先组建的五个旅（即四个决死纵队和工卫旅）的政委，是否由山西籍人担任比较好，这样对蒋先生那里也好说一些。贺总刚才说的这几个干部就是在这种情况下安排的，后来也报告过北方局（当时山西公开工作委员会，只做公开工作，牺盟会、决死队中的党组织由山西临时工委负责）。经过八年抗战和三年解放战争，这些同志表现都是好的。在我向党中央汇报这段工作时，毛泽东同志基本上作了个总结，他说：你们的工作做得不错，以少数人团结了多数人，很好嘛，这是党的统一战线的成功，是特殊形式的。贺龙同志听后未再说什么。
    我又问他，你看牛荫冠这个同志怎么样？他说：牛荫冠身为晋西北行署副主任，表现不好。他家里是地主，土改中斗争他父亲时，他立场不坚定。我当即表示：贺总，恕我直言，我觉得你这种看法不对。你似乎对他还缺乏全面了解。牛荫冠原是清华大学学生，“一二九”运动的积极参加者，后来由党派到山西工作。遵照刘少奇同志和北方局的意见，我全力转入抓武装工作后，由牛荫冠负责牺盟会的日常事务（在五台地区我同朱德同志会面时，他建议我带的山西新军总队，设法取得阎锡山的同意转到上党地区。他也对我说过，你应全力抓武装，牺盟会的工作另找一个人代替主持）。我看他至少有两个大的贡献。一是在组建各县自卫队时，阎锡山发了５０００条步枪，２００多挺轻机枪，经过他的努力，这些枪支基本上掌握在共产党员手中。二是在阎锡山发动“十二月事变”前，他及时撤退了４００多名干部，为党保存了力量。他的父亲是个开明士绅，对我们也是作过些好事的。我认为晋西北的土改中有“左”的错误（我们那里也有过），斗争他父亲是不应该的。特别是用铁丝穿着老人的鼻子，让牛荫冠牵着，搞所谓“放牛”，这种过火行为是极不人道的。因此不能责怪牛荫冠同志“表现不好”、“立场不坚定”。
    我这个人有个毛病，一旦争辩起来，只要自认为还有点道理，是不大容易接受别人意见的。随后，我又追问了他一句：贺总，照你看，在晋西北的决死队干部中也有个把好一点的没有呢？他说：怎么没有？牺盟会、决死队的干部都是好样的，韩钧就是一个。这个人很能干，文章也写得好。我说：是的。韩钧是决死二纵队的政治部主任，实际上他是负全责的，后来还给你当过秘书。我同他交往久而深。当然不是说他没有缺点，比如有些骄傲自大，就是他的一个毛病。
    总之，这次谈话，各自都很坦率，既有共识，也有歧见，但心情都很愉快。我从中得到这样几点启示：一是看人很不容易。对于同样一个干部，由于观察的角度、方法不同，同他接触的长短、深浅、环境不同等等，往往看法各异，褒贬不一，这是常有的事；二是既然如此，在评价、考核、任用干部时，一定要广泛征求大家的意见，再加以分析、鉴别，以取得比较全面、真实的认识。特别是对自己比较熟悉、亲近的干部，更要注意多听听别人的意见，切不要以为自己的看法就那么准、那么有把握；三是领导同志也是从普通党员中逐步提拔起来的，看人看事也难免有偏颇、失真的地方，也会发生认识上的不一致，这就需要经常交换看法，以利消除分歧，统一认识。这些启示对我后来的工作尤其是处理干部任用问题，是很有助益的。
    （七）关于制止盖“大屋顶”。三年经济恢复之后，国家转入了大规模经济建设。这时，一些地方开始出现讲排场、摆阔气、追求豪华、铺张浪费的风气。比如，在房屋建造上，北京、长春、西安、重庆、鞍山等地，兴起了一股盖“大屋顶”楼房的风。所谓“大屋顶”，就是在现代建筑上加一个宫殿式的屋顶。诚然，建筑师们设计出这种房子，是属于建筑艺术和风格上的一个流派，无可厚非。有条件时，在一些公共场合适当地修建一些，也未尝不可。问题是片面追求形式上的美观，不顾经济条件是否允许，也不看是否适用，普遍推行，什么房子都这么盖，就不免有些荒唐了。记得当时北京市就修建了３９座“大屋顶”楼房，浪费惊人。长春地质学院修建一个“地质宫”，盘龙华表，雕梁画栋，造价竟超出预算指标５０％。北京三里河建“四部一会”大楼，也要仿效。我说，这种屋顶只能给飞鸟看，多花许多钱，还有一层楼不能使用。由于李富春同志和我的干预，才取消了国家计委大楼盖“大屋顶”的计划，此事得到了毛泽东、周恩来同志的支持。我当时是全国增产节约委员会主任，毛泽东同志要我以中央的名义立即通令各地，迅速煞住盖“大屋顶”的风。对此贺龙同志是非常拥护的。他说，中央的决定很正确，我们要坚决执行，没有任何条件可讲，谁不执行就唯谁是问！他还亲自布置《四川日报》发表文章，广泛加以宣传。贺龙同志同许多老革命家一样，历尽沧桑，深知创业维艰，处处自奉俭约，他如此坚决地反对铺张浪费，乃是很自然的。那次盖“大屋顶”的风，所以能很快煞住，一是中央发现及时，纠正的决策果断，二是各地行动一致，能做到令行禁止。我想，这也是垂鉴于后的一个成功经验。所谓“歪风不可长！”这是大家都懂得的。然“止风”之道，应在刚起“青蘋之末”而未及弥漫之时。这一点不可不察。
    追寻往事，意在前瞻。不忘记谢世斯人的革命事迹和革命精神，从中获取教益，励志前行，更好地开拓社会主义的未来事业，这应是我们对贺龙同志和所有革命先辈的最好的纪念。
