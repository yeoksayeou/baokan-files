The recent financial, tax, and price inspection revealed that currently, issues such as spreading costs indiscriminately, withholding profits, arbitrary fees, price hikes, and excessive bonuses are prevalent in enterprises. Among these, more than 50% of the total number of enterprises and units have tax evasion problems.

Why do socialist enterprises with decades of management experience disregard laws and regulations so blatantly? Why do factory directors and managers, who wear the crown of "excellent enterprise leaders," not cherish their own honor? During the "Two Sessions," the reporter interviewed some representatives, which somewhat alleviated the doubts.

		Inequitable Distribution Leads Enterprises to "Retain" People with Money

The director of a large enterprise in Beijing received 290 yuan in bonuses last year, which made people envious. However, two smaller factories producing the same product, with significantly lower labor efficiency, had one director receiving 15,000 yuan in bonuses and the other receiving 20,000 yuan. A national "excellent enterprise leader" from Henan said that because he has strictly followed the relevant regulations for many years, the morale in his enterprise is low, and people want to leave.

To retain employees, directors resort to various illegal means. Some exchange scarce products for low-priced food, while others increase the numbers for "overtime pay" and "subsidies."

		Incomplete Legal System Leaves Enterprises Confused

A large petrochemical enterprise in Sichuan has been providing water and electricity at a loss for surrounding factories, mines, and residents for many years. However, this "good deed" did not impress the local auditing department. During a check last year, they insisted that this was selling water and electricity, demanding the payment of back taxes. This person, who is a deputy to the National People's Congress and the director of the factory, said helplessly, "Although our factory is in the right, we just can't find a clear regulation in the laws and regulations, so we have to reluctantly accept the loss and reluctantly pass these 'secondary taxes' on to the surrounding enterprises."

The lack of detailed regulations and unclear stipulations leave enterprises confused. Currently, various economic law enforcement departments are tasked with collecting fines and confiscations. Many law enforcement officers avoid individual households, small enterprises, and loss-making enterprises that clearly violate regulations, focusing instead on large and medium-sized key enterprises with good performance, known as having "more oil." These enterprise leaders believe that as the reform deepens and the legal system improves, the above problems will become history.

### 企业违纪为何多

　　企业违纪为何多
    本报记者  潘岗
    刚刚结束的财税物价大检查发现，目前乱摊成本、截留利润、乱收费、乱涨价、滥发奖金等违纪现象，在企业中普遍存在。其中存在偷漏税问题的企业和单位，就占总户数百分之五十以上。
    为什么有几十年管理经验的社会主义企业，竟如此漠视法纪？为什么戴着“优秀企业家”桂冠的厂长、经理，竟如此不珍惜自己的荣誉？“两会”期间，记者访问了部分代表，总算释了些许疑虑。
    　　　　分配不公使企业以钱“留”人
    北京某大型企业厂长，去年得了二百九十元奖金，人们眼红的不得了。而生产同一产品，人均劳效比该厂低一大截的另外两家小厂，一家厂长奖金领到一万五千元，一家厂长拿到二万整。河南一全国“优秀企业家”说，由于他多年来严格按有关规定办事，弄得所在企业“人心思走”。
    为了留住职工，厂长们便在违纪上“各显神通”。有的用紧俏产品换回低价副食品，有的在“加班费”，“补贴费”上加大数码。
    　　　　法制不健全使企业无所适从
    四川某大型石化企业，为给周围厂矿、居民提供方便，多年来赔钱为他们提供水、电。可是，这一“义举”并未感动当地审计部门。去年一次检查，硬说这是卖水、卖电，要求补交税款。这位当厂长的人大代表无可奈何地说，虽然我们厂没错，可就是在法规条文里找不到明确的规定，只好干认倒霉，违心地将这些“二次税”转嫁到周围企业。
    法规条文不细，规定不明，使企业无所适从，而目前各个经济执法部门都承担罚没款“任务”，许多执法人员避开违纪明显的个体户、小企业、亏损企业，专门检查效益好、所谓“油水大”的大中型骨干企业。这些企业家认为，随着改革的深化和法制的健全，上述问题都将成为历史。
