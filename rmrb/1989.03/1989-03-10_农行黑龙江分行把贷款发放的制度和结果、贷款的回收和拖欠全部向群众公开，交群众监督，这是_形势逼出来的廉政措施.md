The Agricultural Bank of Heilongjiang Branch has, over the past two years, started from the issues that draw the most public complaints and are most prone to corruption, launched the "Fair and Clean, Civilized Banking" campaign across the system, implemented the open loan system, and mobilized the broad masses of farmers to supervise, effectively curbing the unhealthy tendencies in agricultural loans.

After the implementation of rural reforms, the service objects of the Agricultural Bank changed from 600,000 production teams across the province to 3.8 million rural households, increasing the workload and dispersing the work scope, making management more difficult. Farmers urgently need funds for purchasing fertilizers and seeds, buying vehicles and horses, building houses, and engaging in business. Under the same conditions, whoever gets the loan can become wealthy first. The contradiction between supply and demand for funds is becoming increasingly sharp, providing opportunities for those who seek personal gain through power. Some staff members take advantage of their positions to engage in malpractice, lending favors, collecting interest, taking kickbacks, investing in profitable ventures, and even extorting and accepting bribes. Some people collude internally and externally to fraudulently obtain loans and gain benefits. According to the investigation from 1984 to 1985, there were 5,396 cases of using loans for personal gain across the province, totaling 19.7 million yuan, involving 1,723 employees, and farmers had many complaints.

How to solve this problem? Campaigns to rectify discipline and curb bad practices, party rectification, and the handling of major cases have been carried out, and a number of people have been dealt with. Over the years, many methods have been tried, but the effects have not been significant. The facts have told the leaders of the provincial Agricultural Bank that relying solely on internal forces to rectify corruption is not enough, and it is necessary to rely on social forces and mobilize the broad masses of farmers to supervise. In early 1986, the agricultural banking system across the province launched the "Fair and Clean, Civilized Banking" campaign, implementing the open loan system with the main content of publicizing loan objects, purposes, and amounts.

At that time, both inside and outside the Agricultural Bank, there were people who did not agree with the open loan system. Some people thought it was too troublesome and unnecessary, while others thought it was inviting trouble and putting oneself in a passive position. Some people even thought it was just a few leaders singing high notes about "fairness and cleanliness."

Should it be publicized or not? Can it be publicized? Dare it be publicized? The leaders of the provincial Agricultural Bank believed that about 7% of the employees in the provincial agricultural banking system had problems with using loans for personal gain, and the problem was serious. If the "small clowns" are not exposed, they will inevitably cause "big clowns." Strengthening internal management is indeed important, but supplementing the deficiencies in the management system with organized public supervision is more suitable for the current transition period between the old and new systems. The Agricultural Bank actually has no regulations and rules that are not suitable for public disclosure. Open management publicizes the agricultural loan policies and the system and regulations of the Agricultural Bank to the public, clarifies the bottom line of loan issuance and use, and lets the public evaluate it themselves. This is beneficial for restraining power and achieving fairness and justice, and it should be done with confidence and determination.

To make the open loan measures practical and easy to operate, the Heilongjiang Branch conducted careful pilot tests over two years, gradually expanding the scope of openness from farmers' loans to collective, individual industrial and commercial households, and family farm loans, from the original "three openings" to "five openings," making open management penetrate the entire process of credit fund operations.

Policy openness. The relevant rural credit policies, principles, and loan conditions are handed over to the public. In the past, loans were decided by bank cadres and township leaders, "I lend to you, and it is also in accordance with the policy; I do not lend to you, and it is also in accordance with the policy." Now, the broad masses of farmers participate together. During the spring plowing loan peak season, the grassroots business halls organize rural cadres and farmer representatives to study and jointly evaluate who should be lent to and who should not be lent to; who should be lent more and who should be lent less, based on the policy.

Loan interest rate openness. Differential interest rates are implemented, with some rates high and some rates low, and some even subsidized; floating interest rates are implemented, with some that can be lowered and some that can be raised. In the past, some people took advantage of the public's lack of understanding of these policies of ups and downs and more or less, engaging in malpractice and deducting from the public. In response to this situation, the benchmark interest rate, floating method, and penalty for default are disclosed to the public, and the interest rate price and interest rate policy are publicized, so that the public can use this to protect their legitimate rights and interests.

Loan issuance openness. The loan objects, purposes, and amounts are publicized to the public for evaluation of fairness, making it impossible for credit management decision-makers and handlers to favor personal relationships.

Loan recovery openness. For those who borrow money but have the ability to repay but do not repay, the overdue loans are publicized regularly to promote mutual supervision among the public. To encourage active repayment, the loan repayment situation is also publicized regularly, and the credit rating results of borrowers are recorded in the economic archives as a basis for future loans.

Open handling of illegal and disciplinary loan cases. The branch formulated the "Regulations on Penalties for Violating Regulations," clearly stipulating the penalties for violating which regulations, and some typical cases with significant influence and their handling results are compiled into booklets and distributed to grassroots units.

Over the past three years, 98% of the grassroots banks across the province have implemented open agricultural loan management, showing significant effects in four aspects.

The more than 10 billion yuan of loans issued annually by the agricultural banking system across the province are under public supervision, effectively curbing the unhealthy tendencies of using loans for personal gain, greatly reducing the phenomena of backdoor deals, note writing, and favor loans, and significantly improving the loan quality.

In 1987, a sample survey of 375,000 large loans exceeding 10,000 yuan was conducted in 13 cities and prefectures across the province, with only 3.4% having problems. In May 1988, a loan of 570 million yuan from 864 business halls in 31 cities and counties was checked item by item, with 96% of the loans being reasonable and satisfying farmers. Over the past three years, the Agricultural Bank of Zhaodong City has issued a total of 890,000 loans, amounting to more than 92 million yuan, with no cases of using loans for personal gain found.

Party and government departments are satisfied, and farmers' grievances have been alleviated.

In the past few years, during the spring plowing loan peak season, farmers would often complain to newspapers, radio stations, and letters and visits departments, with hundreds of complaints and accusations. Since the loans were publicized in 1986, the number of complainants has been decreasing.

Those who use loans for personal gain and commit malpractice have been punished. Over the past three years, the province has publicly investigated and dealt with 306 cases of illegal and disciplinary actions, with 226 people receiving legal and disciplinary or administrative penalties. These people, who were once considered "powerful" by some, have now become outcasts. The image of the Agricultural Bank has significantly improved, with 70% of the county (city) banks across the province being evaluated as advanced units in spiritual civilization construction last year, and a large number of advanced collectives and individuals who adhere to principles and are enthusiastic about serving farmers have emerged.

Administrative interference has been reduced, and the autonomy of bank operations and management has been strengthened, making funds more reasonably and effectively utilized. The province has achieved a balance in agricultural loan issuance and recovery for three consecutive years, and has recovered 280 million yuan of overdue loans; the scale of agricultural loans has increased by more than 8 billion yuan over three years, playing a role in developing the rural commodity economy.

　　农行黑龙江分行把贷款发放的制度和结果、贷款的回收和拖欠全部向群众公开，交群众监督，这是——
    形势逼出来的廉政措施
    谷伟
    中国农业银行黑龙江分行两年来，从群众意见最大、最容易发生腐败现象的问题入手，在全系统开展“公正廉洁、文明办行”活动，实行农贷公开制度，发动广大农民进行监督，基本上克服了农贷上的不正之风。
    农村实行改革之后，农行的服务对象由全省６万个生产队变为３８０万个农户，工作量增加，工作面分散，管理难度大。农民买肥购种、添车置马、砌房建屋、办货经商，对资金需求很迫切，同等条件下谁能取得贷款谁就能先富。资金供求矛盾日益尖锐，为一些以权谋私的人提供了可乘之机，一些工作人员利用工作之便营私舞弊，放人情款，收人情息，吃回扣，入好汉股，甚至索贿受贿；有些人内外勾结，骗取贷款，获取好处。据１９８４年到１９８５年两年的清查，全省以贷谋私５３９６笔，合计金额１９７０万元，涉及职工１７２３人，农民意见很大。
    用什么办法解决这个问题呢？整纪刹风、整党，查处大案要案，抓过一批、撤过一批。几年来办法没少想，效果却不明显。事实告诉省农行的领导，单靠内部力量整治腐败现象不行，必须依靠社会力量，发动广大农民进行监督。１９８６年初，全省农行系统开展了“公正廉洁、文明办行”的活动，实行以贷款对象公开、贷款用途公开、贷款数额公开为主要内容的农贷公开制度。
    当时，农行内外都有人不赞成农贷公开。有人认为太麻烦，没必要，也有人认为是自讨没趣，自找被动。还有人认为，这是几个领导唱唱“公正廉洁”的高调罢了。
    究竟要不要公开，能不能公开，敢不敢公开？省农行领导认为，全省农行系统有７％左右职工存在以贷谋私的情况，问题是严重的，“小丑”不扬，必酿“大丑”；加强内部管理固然重要，但以有组织的群众监督来补充管理体制中存在的不足，更适合目前新旧体制交替过程的特点；农行实际上也没有什么制度、规定不宜公开。公开化管理把农贷政策和农行制度、规定交给群众，亮清贷款发放、使用的底数，让群众自己去评判，有利于制约权力，实现公正和公平，就应理直气壮，下决心实行。
    为使贷款公开的措施切实可行、易于操作，黑龙江分行经过认真试点，两年来逐步把公开的范围，从农民贷款扩大到对集体、个体工商户贷款和家庭农场贷款等方面，由原来的“三公开”到“五公开”，使公开管理贯穿于信贷资金运动的全过程。
    政策公开。将有关农村信贷的政策、原则和贷款条件交给群众。过去放款是银行干部和乡长说了算，“我贷给你也合乎政策，不贷给你也合乎政策”，现在是广大农民共同参与。春耕放款旺季，基层营业所组织农村干部和农民代表研究，共同依据政策衡量谁该贷，谁不该贷；谁该多贷，谁该少贷。
    贷款利率公开。实行差别利率，有的利率高，有的利率低，有的还贴息；实行浮动利率，有的可下浮，有的可上浮。过去，有些人就利用群众对这一上一下、一多一少的政策不了解，营私舞弊，克扣群众。针对这种情况，把基准利率、浮动办法、违约处罚等向群众交底，公布利率牌价和利率政策，群众就能依此来维护自身的合法权益。
    贷款发放公开。将贷款对象、用途、金额公布于众，让群众评判是否公正，使信贷管理决策者和经办人都无法徇私情。
    贷款回收公开。对于一些借了钱，有能力还而不还的人，定期公布逾期贷款，促进群众互相监督。为鼓励积极还贷，还定期公布贷款归还情况，并把借款人的信用程度考评结果记入经济档案，作为以后贷款的依据。
    违法违纪贷款的处理公开。分行制订《关于违反规章制度的处罚条例》，对违反哪条给什么处罚，规定得清清楚楚，明明白白。还将一些影响较大的典型案例及其处理结果编印成册，下发基层单位。
    ３年来，全省９８％的基层行实行农贷公开管理，在四个方面表现出明显的效果。
    全省农行系统每年发放的１０多亿贷款置于群众的监督之下，使以贷谋私的不正之风受到有效抵制，走后门、批条子、贷人情款的现象大大减少，放款质量显著提高。
    １９８７年全省１３个地市抽查３７．５万笔千元以上的大额贷款，有问题的仅占３．４％。１９８８年５月，逐笔检查３１个市县所属８６４个营业所贷款５．７亿元，投向合理、农民满意的占９６％。肇东市农业银行三年来共贷款８９万笔，９２００多万元，没有发现一起以贷谋私的问题。
    党政部门满意，农民的气顺了。
    前几年，每逢春耕放款旺季，农民纷纷向报社、电台、信访部门投诉，控告信不下百封。自１９８６年贷款公开以来，投诉者越来越少。
    以贷谋私、贪赃枉法的人受到了惩治。三年来，全省公开查处了３０６起违法违纪案件，２２６人分别受到法纪和党纪、政纪处理。这些过去被一些人认为“本事大”的人，现在成了过街老鼠。农行的形象明显好转，去年全省有７０％的县（市）行被当地评为精神文明建设先进单位，涌现出一大批坚持原则、热心为农民办事的先进集体和个人。
    减少了行政乱干预，增强了银行经营管理的自主权，资金得到更合理、更有效的使用。全省连续３年实现农业贷款收放平衡，还收回了２．８亿元陈欠贷款；农贷规模３年增加８亿多元，为发展农村商品经济发挥了作用。
