One suggestion equals 70 million yuan. The Electric Power Branch of the Construction Bank of Hunan Province proposed a lock plan, significantly reducing the investment in the construction of the Wuxiangxi Hydropower Station.

A suggestion from the Electric Power Branch of the Construction Bank of Hunan Province regarding changes to a construction project has been adopted by the State Energy Department, saving 70 million yuan in investment for the Wuxiangxi Hydropower Station, a national key project.

Originally, the navigation structures of the Wuxiangxi Hydropower Station were designed to use a balance weight large screw ship lift. In August of last year, the Electric Power Branch of the Construction Bank of Hunan Province, which is responsible for the loan for this project, conducted extensive investigations and comparisons and proposed changing the ship lift to a lock. This suggestion drew the attention of higher authorities. The Water Resources and Hydropower Planning and Management Bureau immediately organized engineers from the Central South Hydropower Survey and Design Institute to conduct a new economic and technical evaluation. The final decision was to adopt the "lock" plan.

According to preliminary calculations, this plan can save 76.97 million yuan in investment compared to the original plan, saving the country 25.03 million US dollars in foreign exchange expenditures.

　　１项建议＝７０００万元
    湖南建行电力支行提出船闸方案
    五强溪水电站建设投资大为节省
    新华社长沙２月２８日电  （通讯员胡玉明）湖南省建设银行电力支行提出的一项有关改变建设工程的建议，被国家能源部采纳，为五强溪水电站建设节省投资７０００万元。
    国家重点工程五强溪水电站的通航建筑物原来设计采用平衡重大螺杆升船机。去年８月，负责这项工程贷款的湖南省建设银行电力支行，经过反复调查研究和多方比较，提出了将升船机改为船闸的建议，引起了上级有关部门的重视。水利水电规划管理局立即组织中南水电勘测设计院的工程技术人员重新进行经济和技术论证。最后确定采用“船闸”方案。
    据初步计算，这个方案比原来的方案可节省投资７６９７万元，为国家节约外汇支出２５０３万美元。
