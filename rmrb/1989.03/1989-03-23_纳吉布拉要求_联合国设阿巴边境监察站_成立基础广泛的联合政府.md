Kabul authorities' leader Najibullah delivered a radio broadcast to the nation on the evening of March 21, urging the United Nations to establish monitoring stations on the Afghan-Pakistan border and calling for the formation of a broad-based coalition government in Afghanistan.

He said that since the United Nations established monitoring stations on the Soviet-Afghan border during the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, it should also establish monitoring stations on the Afghan-Pakistan border to oversee military activities in the border region.

He reiterated the Kabul authorities' policy of national reconciliation, calling on various Afghan resistance groups to join the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan in establishing a broad-based coalition government.

Regarding the resistance groups' siege of Jalalabad, Najibullah said that government forces are defending their positions.

　　纳吉布拉要求        
    联合国设阿巴边境监察站        
    成立基础广泛的联合政府
    新华社北京３月２２日电  喀布尔消息：喀布尔政权领导人纳吉布拉３月２１日晚向全国发表广播讲话，敦促联合国在阿富汗—巴基斯坦边境设置监察站，并呼吁在阿富汗成立一个具有广泛基础的联合政府。
    他说，既然联合国在苏联从阿富汗撤军时在苏阿边境设立了监察站，那么它也应当在阿巴边境设立监察站，以监视边境地区的军事行动。
    他重申了喀布尔政权的民族和解政策，呼吁阿富汗各派游击队同人民民主党一起建立一个具有广泛基础的联合政府。
    在谈到游击队围攻贾拉拉巴德市时，纳吉布拉说，政府军正守卫着他们的阵地。
