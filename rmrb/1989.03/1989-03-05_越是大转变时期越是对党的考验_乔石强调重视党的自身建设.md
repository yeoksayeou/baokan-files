Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 4th.

The March 5th issue of the "Party Building" magazine published a speech by Qiao Shi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, on strengthening party building. He pointed out that during a period of great transformation, it is even more important to emphasize and strengthen the party's own construction.

In this speech at the Central Party Building Research Class, Qiao Shi, in relation to the new situation, discussed the issue of strengthening party building. He said, our party is currently in a historical period of great transformation. This is another great and profound transformation since the founding of the party. The greater the transformation, the greater the test for the party, and the more it is necessary to emphasize and strengthen the party's own construction.

Qiao Shi pointed out that over the past few decades, we have accumulated many good experiences and traditions in strengthening party building, which are still applicable today and should be inherited and carried forward. At the same time, we must use the basic viewpoints and methods of Marxism to study the theory and practice of strengthening the construction of a ruling party under new historical conditions, gradually change the concepts and practices that do not meet the requirements of the new situation, and continuously create new experiences and practices. In terms of party building, which practices from the past must be adhered to, and if not adhered to, will weaken party building and weaken party leadership; which practices must be reformed, and if not reformed, will similarly weaken party building and weaken party leadership, these are issues that need to be carefully studied. Both adherence and reform must be based on reality and seek truth from facts. Adherence must be adhered to in essence, and reform must be reformed in essence. Our goal is to strive to build our party into a strong core leading the people to build socialism with Chinese characteristics. This is a major issue facing the entire party.

　　越是大转变时期越是对党的考验
    乔石强调重视党的自身建设
    据新华社北京３月４日电  ３月５日出版的《党建》杂志发表了中共中央政治局常委乔石关于加强党的建设的讲话。他指出，在大转变时期更要重视和加强党的自身建设。
    乔石在中央党的建设研究班上的这篇讲话，联系新形势，谈了加强党的建设的问题。他说，我们党正处在一个历史性的大转变时期。这是建党以来党的又一次巨大而深刻的转变。越是大转变时期，越是对党的考验，也越需要重视和加强党的自身建设。
    乔石指出，过去几十年中，我们为加强党的建设积累了许多好经验、好传统，对于今天仍然适用的，当然要继承和发扬。同时，我们又必须运用马克思主义的基本观点和方法，研究新的历史条件下加强执政党建设的理论和实践，逐步改变不适应新形势要求的观念和做法，不断创造新经验、新做法。在党的自身建设方面，过去哪些做法是必须坚持的，不坚持就会削弱党的建设，削弱党的领导；哪些做法是必须改革的，不改革就同样会削弱党的建设，削弱党的领导，这是需要很好研究的。坚持和改革都要从实际出发，实事求是。坚持要坚持在点子上，改革也要改革在点子上。我们的目标，是努力把我们党建设成为领导人民建设有中国特色的社会主义的坚强核心。这是全党面临的一个重大课题。
