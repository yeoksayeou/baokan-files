The Six Major Environmental Disasters in the World

1. The Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Plant Accident. On March 28, 1979, a reactor at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in the United States experienced the most serious accident in U.S. nuclear power history. Most of the reactor's components were destroyed, and some radioactive materials leaked out.

2. The Mexico City Liquefied Gas Explosion. On November 19, 1984, an explosion occurred at a liquefied gas supply station on the outskirts of Mexico City. Fifty-four gas storage tanks exploded and caught fire, killing more than 1,000 people, injuring more than 4,000, destroying over 1,400 buildings, and leaving 30,000 people homeless.

3. The Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster. On December 3, 1984, a serious accident occurred at a pesticide factory in Bhopal, India, owned by the U.S. Union Carbide Corporation. Highly toxic methyl isocyanate leaked out, resulting in the deaths of more than 2,000 people and affecting 200,000 others.

4. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Accident. On April 26, 1986, the fourth reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant near Kiev exploded and caught fire, releasing a large amount of radioactive material, causing severe environmental pollution. About 130,000 residents were evacuated. The radioactive dust produced by the accident spread with the wind to Northern Europe and Western Europe, causing pollution in several European countries. In the accident, 31 people died, and 237 people suffered severe radiation injuries.

5. The Rhine River Pollution Incident. On November 1, 1986, a warehouse fire occurred at the Sandoz chemical company in Basel, Switzerland, located on the Rhine River. Large quantities of toxic chemicals stored in the warehouse flowed into the Rhine River with the firefighting water, severely poisoning the river. Aquatic life in the river died in large numbers, and residents along the river had difficulty obtaining drinking water.

6. The Brazilian Radioactive Contamination Accident. In September 1987, a lead container containing the radioactive isotope cesium-137 discarded by the Cancer Research Institute in Goiânia, Brazil, was sold as scrap to a scrap metal company in the city. On September 28, workers at the scrap metal company opened the lead container, releasing the radioactive material. People in the surrounding area were exposed to high doses of nuclear radiation, resulting in the deaths of three people, acute radiation sickness in more than 30 people, and harm to over 200 others.

　　世界六大公害事件
    １、美国三里岛核电站事故。１９７９年３月２８日，美国三里岛核电站的一座反应堆发生一起美国核电史上最严重的事故，反应堆大部分元件烧毁，一部分放射性物质外泄。
    ２、墨西哥液化气爆炸事故。１９８４年１１月１９日，墨西哥首都近郊的一座液化气供应站发生爆炸事故，５４座储气罐爆炸起火，死１０００多人，伤４０００多人，毁房１４００余幢，３万人无家可归。
    ３、印度博帕尔毒气泄漏事故。１９８４年１２月３日，美国联合碳化物公司设在博帕尔市的一家农药厂发生严重事故，剧毒物质异氰酸甲酯外泄，死亡２０００余人，２０万人受害。
    ４、苏联切尔诺贝利核电站事故。１９８６年４月２６日，基辅市附近的切尔诺贝利核电站４号反应堆爆炸起火，大量放射性物质外泄，对周围环境造成严重污染，附近１３万居民紧急疏散。事故产生的放射性尘埃，随风飘向北欧、西欧等地区，使欧洲诸国受到污染。事故中，有３１人死亡，２３７人受到严重的放射性伤害。
    ５、欧洲莱茵河污染事件。１９８６年１１月１日，位于莱茵河畔的瑞士巴塞尔桑多兹化工公司的一座仓库起火，仓库中贮存的大量有毒化学品随灭火用水流入莱茵河，使莱茵河受到严重毒化，河中的生物大量死亡，沿河居民饮用水一度发生困难。
    ６、巴西放射性污染事故。１９８７年９月，巴西戈亚尼亚市癌症研究所丢弃的一个装有放射性同位素铯—１３７的铅罐，被当作废品卖给该市的一家废品收购公司。９月２８日，废品公司的职工将铅罐砸开，里面的放射性物质外泄，周围的人受到大剂量的核辐射，有３人死亡，３０多人患急性放射病，２００多人受害。
