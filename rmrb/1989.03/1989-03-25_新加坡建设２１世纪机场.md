Singapore is constructing a 21st-century airport. The Changi International Airport in Singapore is renowned as the "world's finest airport." This airport handles over a million air passengers each month and is highly modernized and convenient.

However, the Singapore Civil Aviation Authority feels that this is still not enough. It has allocated $650 million to build a new airport terminal, which is scheduled to be operational next year. The goal is to create a miniature city where all the needs of travelers can be met. In addition to business centers and medical facilities, the new terminal will feature gyms, barbershops, daycare centers, and even air-conditioned parking lots for rental cars, which is particularly important in the equatorial climate. For the convenience of passengers, the two buildings will be connected by high-speed automatic elevators. As the airport expands, it is expected that by the 21st century, the annual passenger capacity of Singapore's Changi Airport will increase to 20 million.

　　新加坡建设２１世纪机场
    新加坡樟宜国际机场被人们称为“世界最优秀机场”。该机场每月接送１００多万飞机乘客，现代化和方便程度较高。
    然而新加坡民航局觉得这一切还不够，它已拨出６．５亿美元建设新机场大楼，将于明年投入使用。据说，其目的是建造一座微型城市，那里将为满足游客的任何要求创造条件。除营业中心和医疗中心外，新楼内将开设健身房、理发馆、托儿所，甚至有空调设备的出租汽车停车库，这在赤道气候条件下相当重要。为方便乘客，两座楼房由高速自动电梯连接。随着航空站的扩大，预计进入２１世纪，新加坡樟宜机场的通过能力一年将增加到２０００万人。
