Walking through the streets of Stockholm, you will notice from the large and small posters that Sweden's cooperative societies are particularly numerous. From housing, car refueling, retail consumption to insurance, savings, entertainment, and funerals, every industry has cooperative societies. The most influential consumer cooperative society has members that make up about half of the total population. Many infants are registered into housing cooperative societies even before they are born, because new housing requires queuing, sometimes for as long as 7-8 years.

In Sweden's mixed economic model, cooperative societies are the "third force" after private enterprises and state-owned economies, playing an indispensable role in Sweden's economy and social life.

The director of the Swedish Cooperative Society Research Institute, Aimei Bolein, introduced to the reporter that the history of Swedish cooperative societies can be traced back over 100 years. At that time, industrialization had just begun, and the influx of rural populations into cities caused severe shortages of housing, clothing, and food. To solve problems of eating, dressing, and housing, some people spontaneously organized various cooperative societies using their savings and loans. Subsequently, during the early stages of Sweden's economic development and the 1930s when overcoming economic recession, cooperative societies played an important role. Today, Sweden has become an industrialized country, but the strength of cooperative societies has not weakened; instead, it has continued to develop.

According to data provided by Aimei Bolein, currently, 20% of retail consumer goods are operated by cooperative society stores, over 60% of food consumption is provided by agricultural cooperative societies, and two-thirds of post-war new housing is constructed by housing cooperative societies.

Swedish cooperative societies are freely organized. Their purpose is not to make a profit but to meet the direct needs of members through mutual aid, differing from joint-stock companies. Cooperative societies are independent of political parties and churches, practicing democratic management. Management personnel are elected by members. The highest authority belongs to the members' congress. Each cooperative society has strict regulations to follow. Cooperative societies are responsible to their members, so they must compete with private companies and state-owned enterprises according to market rules, providing members with reasonably priced products and superior quality services. In terms of production cooperative societies, agricultural cooperative societies formed by family farms hold an important position. They provide members with processing, storage, repair, and other services, are responsible for product development and sales, and provide farmers with various information.

The development of Swedish cooperative societies is inseparable from the government's active support. The government provides cooperative societies with a large amount of low-interest loans and other conveniences, and also allocates funds from the budget each year to subsidize cooperative societies. The parliament has a special parliamentary cooperative society committee.

### 形式多样　促进生产　方便群众  合作社——瑞典一宝

　　形式多样　促进生产　方便群众
    合作社——瑞典一宝
    本报记者  顾耀铭
    走在斯德哥尔摩的街头，你会从大大小小的招贴牌上发现，瑞典的合作社特别多。从住房、汽车加油、零售消费到保险、储蓄、娱乐、丧事，各行各业都有合作社。影响最大的消费者合作社的成员约占总人口的一半。不少婴儿出生前就被父母登记加入了住房合作社，因为要求新房须排队，有时长达７—８年。
    在瑞典的混合经济模式中，合作社是在私营企业和国营经济之后的“第三种力量”，在瑞典的经济和社会生活中有着不可忽视的作用。
    瑞典合作社研究所负责人艾姆勃雷恩向记者介绍说，瑞典合作社的历史可以追溯到１００多年前。当时，工业化刚开始，农村人口涌入城市，造成了房荒、服装和食品匮缺等严重困难。为了解决吃、穿、住等问题，一部分人用自己的积蓄和借贷自发地组织了各种合作社协会。随后，在瑞典经济发展初期和本世纪３０年代克服经济衰退的时期合作社都起了重要作用。今天，瑞典已成了工业发达国，但是合作社的力量非但没有削弱，而且还有发展。
    据艾姆勃雷恩提供的数据，目前，零售消费品的２０％由合作社商店经营，食品消费６０％以上是农业合作社提供的，战后２／３的新建住房是住房合作社建造的。
    瑞典的合作社是自由组合起来的。它的目的不是盈利，而是通过互助满足会员的直接需要，不同于股份制。合作社独立于政党和教会，实行民主管理。管理人员是社员推选的。最高权力属于社员大会。各合作社都有严格的章程可循。合作社要对自己的成员负责，因此它必须按照市场规律同私人公司和国营企业竞争，向社员提供价格合理的产品和质量优异的服务。在生产合作社方面，由家庭农场组成的农业合作社占了重要地位。它向社员提供加工、贮存、修理等服务，还负责产品的开发和销售，并向农场主提供各种信息。
    瑞典合作社的发展同政府的积极支持是分不开的。政府向合作社提供大量低息贷款和其它方便，每年还从预算中拨出资金补贴合作社。议会里专门设有议会合作社委员会。
