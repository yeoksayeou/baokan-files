It's strange, but I have a deeper understanding of Aya than anyone else, even though we don't interact much.

Before the New Year, I don't remember how I met her. I don't know if she even remembers me. We bumped into each other in the hallway, and I blurted out, "Aya, give me a New Year's card!" It was abrupt, but I didn't feel rude. The next day, she quietly came to my desk: "I drew it, it's not good!" I opened the small package and saw a little girl in a cotton-padded jacket holding a string of candy apples, with a small red fingerprint in the bottom right corner. The fingerprint was drawn with a pen to look like a plump little cherry, with two childish characters "Aya" written below it. The poetry, the flavor, hey, the girl holding the candy apples was just like Aya herself! "It's really good, I like it very much!" I exclaimed, but when I looked up, she was already gone.

This is Aya, the Aya who I couldn't forget after just one meeting. Her eyes, when she looks at you, don't seem to be sizing you up at all, but rather, she lays out her entire inner world for you to see. She speaks slowly and clearly, each word distinct, like pearls falling onto a jade plate. She walks slowly, her long hair swaying as she goes, as if she were alone in the world, so free and easy. I can't remember which great poet said, "You can take my air, take my bread, but you can't take my smile." Isn't that smile Aya's calm and peaceful smile? She's not particularly beautiful, but she has charm.

Someone gave me a calligraphy scroll, and I wanted to have it mounted. Aya's face popped into my head, so I went to her without hesitation. She still agreed shyly, "Okay, but I'm not very good at it!"

By chance, I saw a photo album of her daughter and couldn't put it down. Was it the girl's expressive eyes that reminded me of her mother? Was it Aya's childlike heart that reminded me of the girl? Perhaps it was "loving the house and the sparrows," and I even liked her daughter. I couldn't figure it out, so I didn't think about it. I just did what I wanted to do straight away: "Give me a photo, the best one!" I said without giving her a chance to refuse. She smiled and pushed the album towards me: "Pick whichever you like, but you know, I only have one of each photo, I'm only giving it to you because you asked..."

Normally, people need frequent interaction to get to know each other. Thinking about it, although we work in the same building, we rarely see each other. When we do meet, we might exchange a smile, nod briefly, or say a quick hello. I don't even know where her home is, what her husband does, or how old she is. Is it "love at first sight"? No, it seems like we were already in love before we even met, connected by something unseen. Maybe others wouldn't think we're good friends, but I know, no one is closer to me than she is.

I don't know when it started, but gradually, I felt a sense of unease. I kept asking Aya to do this and that, so confidently, so thoughtlessly. She fulfilled all my requests without hesitation, and I accepted her gifts generously. But could I return the favor? I wasn't sure. So, I warned myself: don't bother her anymore. But somehow, it felt like something was guiding me, and I would find myself knocking on her door without thinking, and she would always agree so readily. I felt more and more uneasy, tossing and turning in bed for several nights. Suddenly, my gaze fell on a toy, and I stared at the two dolls holding hands, so close and intimate. Ah, why didn't I think of it before? That's what "childhood sweethearts" are like! I suddenly realized, true feelings have no suspicion, like clear river water flowing from a dense forest, bringing life to the grass and laughter to the pebbles. Really, as long as our hearts are in sync, our emotional world will have a spring that never dries up, always fresh and sweet.

At this moment, I really wanted to run over and knock on Aya's door. This time, I had no requests, no demands, I just wanted to tell her that there is a beautiful understanding between our hearts, connected by two innocent hearts.

    无猜
    张彬彬
    说也怪，我和阿雅交往不多，却有一种比任何人都更深一层的了解。
    新年前，我不知怎么认识了她，她是否认识我可不知道。走廊相遇，开门见山：“阿雅，给咱张贺年片！”要得唐突，却不觉得冒昧。第二天，她悄悄来到我桌前：“我画的，不好！”我打开小纸包，只见方寸之间，穿棉猴的小姑娘一手插兜，一手拿着一串糖葫芦，右下角是一枚小小的红指印，用笔勾出一道小弯，像个水灵灵的小樱桃，樱桃把下歪斜着两个稚拙的小字“阿雅”。那诗意，那韵味，嘿，拿糖葫芦的女孩不正是阿雅本人的写照么？！“真好，我很喜欢！”我赞叹着，抬头时，人已不见了。
    这就是阿雅，那个才见一面就忘不掉的阿雅。她那双眼睛瞧人时，丝毫也不觉着是在打量你，而是向你和盘端出她的内心世界。她说话不慌不忙，字字清晰，大珠小珠落玉盘。她走路不紧不慢，披肩发一甩一甩的，遗世独立似地飘逸。记不清哪位大诗人说过：“可以拿走我的空气，拿走我的面包，却拿不走你的微笑”。这微笑不就是阿雅宁静安详的微笑么？！她长得不算漂亮，可有魅力。
    别人送我一幅字画，想裱一下，脑子里又蹦出阿雅，便毫不犹豫地找她。她仍是那么羞答答地应诺：“行，只是裱不太好！”
    偶然见到她女儿的一个影集，不知怎么竟爱不释手。是女孩那会说话的眼睛像妈妈？是阿雅童心未泯像那女孩？或许是我“爱屋及乌”，连她的女儿都喜欢了。想不明白便不想，想做的直来直去：“给张照片，要最好的！”我不容反驳地说。她笑了，纤纤玉手将影集推到我面前：“随你挑，不过，你知道，这些照片我每样仅一张，只是你要，我才给的……”
    按常理，人必须频繁接触才能了解。细细想来，我与她虽在一个楼里上班，平素却少往来，见面顶多互递一个微笑，随便点一点头，简短的问声好。我甚至不知道她的家在哪，她的丈夫做什么，她的年龄多大。是“一见钟情”么？不，我们好象没见面便钟情了，没认识之前就被什么悄悄地沟通了。也许别人不会认为我俩是好朋友，可我心里清楚，没有谁会比我与她更亲密了。
    不知什么时候起，心里渐渐漫上些许不安。我让阿雅办这办那，那么不假思索，那么自信，她对我的要求无限地满足，我对她的馈赠慨然接受。可我能投桃报李么？不清楚。于是暗暗告诫自己：再不麻烦她了。可冥冥之中，总好像有些什么左右着我，有事总情不自禁地去敲她的门，她也总是那么爽快地满口应承。我越来越不安了，好几晚躺在床上翻来覆去睡不着。忽然有一天，我的目光落在玩具上，久久注视着那两个手拉手的娃娃，她们情同手足，亲密无间。哎呀，我怎么没想到，那不就是两小无猜么？我恍然醒悟，真正的感情是没有猜忌的，好像清澈的河水，从密密的林中流出，给小草带来绿色的生命，给鹅卵石带来滴溜溜的笑声。真的，只要心心相印，我们的情感世界就会有一眼永不枯竭的清泉，永远甘冽。
    这时候，我真想跑过去敲阿雅的门。这回无所需，无所求，只是想告诉她，我俩心灵中有种美好的默契，那是靠两颗无猜的心沟通的。
