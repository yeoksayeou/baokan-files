Some bachelors in a certain factory jointly wrote a letter of opinion and posted it in the factory's bulletin board, demanding a change in the situation where dinner always consists of leftovers. The personnel director, acting on orders, reprimanded them: "Posting big character posters is illegal! If you don't tear them down yourselves..."

In a certain institution, after a few employees received their professional appointment letters individually, they jointly wrote a suggestion letter and posted it next to the wall newspaper, demanding the breaking of the secrecy surrounding the evaluation and appointment process, the public display of the evaluation results, and a meeting to explain the reasons for any "exceptional" appointments. The institution's leadership warned them: "Posting big character posters is illegal and is an expression of liberalization!"

What is a big character poster? In the eyes of these "officials," it seems that if the characters are big and the paper is large, it is a big character poster. To say they do not understand that "big character poster" is a specific political concept would be too harsh. They are using the charge of "writing big character posters" to silence others, which is probably a remnant of the "raising the banner" mentality. Our laws indeed no longer protect citizens' right to write big character posters, but they do not regulate the size of the paper or the font used for writing opinions or suggestion letters. As long as it is not publishing speeches that attack the socialist system, endanger social order, or defame citizens, whether one writes in tiny characters or in "1st grade" font, no one has the right to interfere!

Currently, many grassroots units have high enthusiasm for public participation in politics and democratic supervision. Establishing a public opinion supervision area within the unit and posting opinion letters signed by employees is not a bad strategy for increasing transparency and strengthening democratic management.

### “大字报”质疑

　　“大字报”质疑
    鄢烈山
    某厂几个单身汉联名写了一份意见书贴在厂部公告栏里，要求改变晚餐总吃残菜剩饭的状况。人保股长奉命训斥：“贴大字报犯法！你们若不自动撕……”
    某所几个工作人员在个别接到专业职务聘请书后，联名写了一份建议书，贴在壁报旁，要求打破评聘的保密状态，张榜公布评定结果，并开会说明“破格”者凭什么“破格”。所领导正告他们：“贴大字报是违法的，是自由化的表现！”
    什么叫大字报？在这些“官”们看来，似乎字儿大、纸儿大就是大字报。说他们根本不明白“大字报”是个特定的政治概念未免冤枉，他们是以“写大字报”的罪名堵人家的嘴巴，这大概也是“上纲上线”的遗风吧？我们的法律的确不再保护公民有写“大字报”的权利，但并未规定写意见或建议书的用纸尺寸和字体大小。只要不是发表攻击社会主义制度、危害社会治安、侮辱诽谤公民等言论，提意见时是写蝇头小楷还是写“１号字”，谁也无权干涉！
    现在不少基层单位群众参政和民主监督的积极性很高，在单位里开辟一块舆论监督园地，张贴职工署名的意见书，不失为提高透明度、强化民主管理之一策。
