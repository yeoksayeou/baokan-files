		A Liter of Milk Only Worth Three Pieces of Bubble Gum

		Recently, farmers in many areas of the Vojvodina Autonomous Province in Yugoslavia have stopped delivering milk and have been pouring their produced milk into the wilderness in buckets, protesting the low price of milk purchases.

		According to reports, the current purchase price of a liter of milk in Yugoslavia is not even as much as a liter of mineral water, equivalent to the price of three pieces of bubble gum.

		Dairy products are the most important food for Yugoslav residents, and changes in their prices directly affect the lives of thousands of households. The federal government has decided to raise the purchase price of milk starting April 1. However, it is estimated that the new price still cannot balance the cost of milk production, and thus cannot meet the demands of the farmers. In February this year, Yugoslavia's milk production has significantly decreased, and it is estimated that this month it will continue to decline. Local news media have issued warnings: if this continues, cities will soon face a shortage of milk, and believe that the only way to expand milk production is to allow milk prices to be freely formed in the market.

　　一升牛奶只抵三块泡泡糖
    近来，南斯拉夫粮仓伏伊伏丁那自治省许多地区的农民纷纷停止交售牛奶，并把自己生产的牛奶成桶成桶泼洒荒野，以此对牛奶收购价格太低表示不满和抗议。
    据报道，目前南斯拉夫一升牛奶的收购价还不及一升矿泉水，只相当于三块泡泡糖的价钱。
    奶制品是南斯拉夫居民最重要的食品，其价格变动情况直接影响着千家万户的生活。联邦政府已作出决定，从四月一日起提高牛奶的收购价。但据计算，新的价格仍不能使牛奶生产收支相抵，因此也不能满足农民的要求。今年二月份南斯拉夫的牛奶产量已显著下降，估计本月份还将下跌。当地的新闻媒介已发出警告：如此下去，城里很快会出现缺奶现象，并认为，要扩大牛奶生产，唯一办法是允许牛奶在市场自由形成价格。
