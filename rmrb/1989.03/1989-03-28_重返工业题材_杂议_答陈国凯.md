	Reflections on Returning to Industrial Themes
		— A Reply to Chen Guokai

	Dear Guokai,

	I hope this message finds you well. We just parted ways, and you suddenly sent me this “open letter” (published in the March 17th edition of this newspaper), challenging me. Regarding the topic of “returning to industrial themes,” the complexities involved cannot be summed up in a few words. Let me think about it seriously for a night.

	In late 1982, after completing the short story “New Year’s Greetings,” I did not write any more novels set in factory life for six years. I found myself at the peak of my industrial novel writing, only to suddenly disappear. Once you rise to the literary stage, you must also know when to leave. At that time, I felt that I had reached my own insurmountable boundary; my industrial themes had run out of options. It should not have been like this; it constrained me, and I also mistreated my beloved theme. Industrial themes are the easiest to consume oneself. I was oppressed by the life I portrayed and the characters I created. Lovable readers, like “Learning from Lei Feng,” promoted and sought out my fictional characters in real life, creating many tragicomic scenes that were laughable and pathetic, making me feel guilty. I felt that the responsibility of a writer was too great, and literary freedom was too little.

	In 1983, urban reforms gradually began. Large-scale industrial reforms were different from the household responsibility system in rural areas. I was familiar with factory life, but I could not predict what it would become. I had no confidence, no self-assurance. Rather than forcing myself to express poorly, it was better to remain silent discreetly. Moreover, the momentum of reform was extraordinarily swift, and the “reform literature” trend was surging. The literary scene was already lively, and a few less people joining the fray would not matter. Although during my creation, I relied most on imagination, when observing and analyzing life, I was concerned with reality, attempting to grasp the destiny of reality and find my own depth within it. Let the depth of reality nourish my thoughts, and let the absurdity of reality stimulate my imagination. Industrial themes are fraught with danger. In enterprises, key figures in production activities often find themselves at the center of various conflicts. They are mostly leaders. Policy-oriented, era-sensitive, difficult to control, with strong political colors, changing with the changes in life. It is very difficult to turn China's unique politics into beauty, at least more difficult than turning other lives into beauty. Creating them into literary images with lasting life is even more difficult. Since Watt invented the steam engine, sparking the first industrial revolution, nearly 200 years have passed. It has dramatically changed the face of the world and rapidly advanced human civilization. Yet, how many masterpieces reflecting industrial themes are there?

	Artists comfortably enjoy the fruits of large-scale industry. They lack the necessary interest in it, even disdaining it, adopting an aristocratic arrogance towards workers (the current economic reasons for actively marrying into the business world are another matter).

	Industry is, of course, also a product of human culture; it contains human essence. But human form will definitely be changed by technology. Six years ago, Jacques Ellul's book left a deep impression on me—modern science and technology, armed and driven by industry, are a powerful authoritarian force. They transform human life fundamentally, subtly infiltrating every aspect of life, forming an irresistible alien universe. They impose their laws on the world and eliminate all resistance. They perpetuate themselves, grow exponentially, and their direction is irreversible. Human intervention is futile; rather, human choices must be restricted by it. It disregards cultural and conscious differences, controlling economic development and social progress. Humans remain rulers, but are also ruled by technology. Poverty, pollution, war, social chaos—these constitute the true forces striking humanity, gradually causing people to lose their original characteristics. How do we find the value of industry and humans? Especially in modern industry, discovering the value of humans? The modern material civilization brought by modern industry—is it the victory of industry, or the victory of humans? These questions have been troubling me, making me unsure of what kind of “industrial characters” I should create.

	I digressed. But these were my genuine thoughts at the time. I needed to temporarily distance myself from industrial themes to reflect, introspect, and savor the experience. Since this is an era of “deconstruction and reconstruction,” every writer cannot help but think, doubt, explore, deny, and reconstruct. Not writing industrial-themed novels for a few years does not mean breaking away from industrial themes. I am free to come and go. My pen has distanced itself from industry, but I have not. I am destined to experience, observe, and analyze factory life. Besides, there are people who do not let me “escape” from industrial themes. They say I am something of industrial themes, something of “reform literature.” I am flattered and feel unworthy. When I wrote industrial-themed novels, I did not know what “reform” was, and I still do not understand the concept of “reform literature.” Many Chinese concepts are produced in a haphazard, presumptuous manner: industrial themes equal reform, writing industrial themes is writing “reform”; writing “reform” is “reform literature.” “Reform” itself has no rules, but the slogan of “reform literature” is shouted loudly, rising in a frenzy, a swarm. China has never lacked those who chase trends or go against the flow. Thus, both “reform” and literature are tarnished. People see literary works that depict “reform” themes and first raise a question in their hearts. If there is nothing else to read, they are unwilling to touch it.

	I have no “ism” to discuss; in creation, I mainly trust my intuition. I also cannot find a ready-made theory to explain today's social trends or the current state of contemporary literature. Theories, no matter how good, can only act as midwives. Modern theories are ambitious, seemingly ready to replace the emotional labor of childbirth. However, industrial themes are still in a semi-taboo state. Fashionable people, elegant and carefree individuals, and those seeking eternity will not visit. Industrial themes have become short-lived themes, themes that are laborious and unrewarding. Those who advocate theme determinism do not like it, saying it determines failure. Those who oppose theme determinism also do not like it. It is truly a situation where “good men do not do it, and bad men cannot do it.” Although every contemporary person's life cannot do without modern industrial products, literature seems to be able to stand independently from industrial society.

	Modern social trends are cunning, are prematurely ripe, rotten, not fully ripe. Literature wants to become an appendage of this trend or turn itself into a new trend. It can be broad-minded, playful, deep, eloquent, crafty, lazy, humorous, sharp, beautiful, enjoy... everything. It is clear that not only industrial themes are impoverished, but also human character, literary character, and social character. Contemporary writers are ashamed of the contemporary era. Enjoying the contemporary era is fine, but portraying it seems to be awkward, insufficient. Reality tortures contemporary literature like God mocks Salieri: “Everywhere you see clever mediocrities, I can only forgive you, Amen!”

	I apologize for returning to the topic of industrial themes. Do not regard leaving industrial themes and returning to industrial themes as a grand occasion like a festival. Every time a writer writes a piece, it is a new beginning. This is the most crucial part. No matter what you write, you must mobilize all your life experiences. Writing industrial themes is not just about understanding factory life.

	The natural world follows the law of ebb and flow. For example: breathing, day and night, cold and warm, tides ebbing and flowing, etc. The life of writing also needs to be balanced, constantly adjusting the frequency. In the past few years, I have published two novels, six novellas, and a batch of short pieces, feeling light and free, with a peaceful mind. From south to north, I have investigated many enterprises and visited many businesspeople. I personally value the feelings and gains of these few years, which cannot be summarized as “energetic” or “not energetic.” Why return to industrial themes? The reason is simple: in the past two years, I have regained the freedom to feel factory life. Without fresh feelings, I leave; with feelings, I return. I value my own feelings, not the themes. I do not think themes have a decisive meaning for me. I am not a great writer, and my works will not be eternal. Therefore, I have no burden. Using a phrase from Nana Moscoli: industrial themes are my drug.

	In this once-serious literary “territory” of industrial themes, there is always a feeling of not belonging. First, I think of the responsibility that my peers do not like to hear. Currently, it is the responsible and hardworking entrepreneurs and diligent farmers who are supporting China's difficult but hopeful economy. The state demands taxes from them, employees demand bonuses, society demands high-quality industrial and consumer goods, and they still have to endure the squeeze from speculators, private dealers, and various economic rebels—these economic rebels' destructive power is no less than that of the political rebels during the “Cultural Revolution.” Considering the current state of society and the economy, the state of enterprises, and the emotions of employees, what rights do writers have, and what rights do they not have? It is impossible to avoid the confusion about industrial reality, and it is also impossible to avoid the criticism of the moral crisis in society.

	I still want to find that firm and uplifting passion from before. But I do not want to be a “mirror” or a “whip.” Based on my own psychological structure, I will find a new literary perspective to examine and perceive industrial themes. Especially, I should dare to face and reconstruct the spiritual reality, not just realistically copy factory life. Even with alcohol for courage, I have not spoken confidently about industrial themes. Because I still need to soberly estimate: “Are industrial themes also full of confidence in you?” With completely new content and completely new artistic forms, opening up a new path for industrial themes—how difficult.

	There is also a critic who evaluates the merits of a novel: how deeply the character images enter people's hearts? Can they become long-term spiritual companions for readers? Do they truly grasp people's thoughts? I guess new wave writers might sneer at this standard. This standard was nothing to past great writers, but for many contemporary writers, including myself, it is indeed unattainable. Rather than failing to reach it, it is better to negate the standard itself, cursing it to the extreme. Do not have any standards, rebuild your own values, or simply do not have values. Criticism and sweeping are very convenient, but literary sweeping will never produce the situation that the sweepers hope for—standing alone in a vast expanse of white. What is the standard for industrial themes? The standard for literature is its standard, and there should be no new standards.

	Because: the shock of a novel is not from the theme, but from the way it is presented. If I am only “grand” and “energetic” when writing about large enterprises, then the “grand” and “energetic” is the large enterprise, not me. Industrial themes do not necessarily have to be grand; they can be delicate. I think that portraying industrial life more needs delicate emotions, needs to freely and thoroughly unleash creative imagination, and needs to embody a comprehensive soul of contemporary society.

	Industrial themes cannot avoid this fact: in today's troubled world, economically backward countries, even if they do not easily become political colonies of developed countries, will inevitably become colonies of developed economies and modern science and technology. People comfortably accept this reality and enjoy the cultural achievements of modern humanity. Social forms have changed, people's attitudes have changed, large enterprises are large cultures. In literary terms, the boundaries of themes are becoming increasingly blurred. Literature will no longer have “inherited territories.”

	I do not promise anything to others or to myself. Just like in popular songs, “follow your feelings, hold the hand of your dreams.” Dreams are useless, but creation cannot be without dreams. Now still in a dream, let's wait until the dream ends to evaluate its good or bad fortune.

	Once the conversation starts, it is hard to stop. Today, there is no alcohol involved. Are you tired? Sleepy? Let's stop here. I wish you and I both have a good sleep.

	Handshake!

### “重返工业题材”杂议——答陈国凯

专栏：

　　“重返工业题材”杂议        
    ——答陈国凯
    国凯兄：近安！
    刚分手，你突然又来这么一封“公开信”（见本报３月１７日）将我一军。关于“重返工业题材”，这个中的酸甜苦辣非一两句话能说得清楚，让我认真地想了一晚上。
    １９８２年底写完短篇小说《拜年》，６年来便没有再写以工厂生活为背景的小说。我是在自己的工业小说的创作高峰突然消失的。登上了文坛，一定还要懂得什么时候离开文坛。当时我感到自己成了自己无法逾越的疆界，我的工业题材走投无路。它不应该是这个样子，它束缚了我，我也糟踏了自己心爱的题材。工业题材最容易吞食自我，我受到我所表现的生活、我所创造的人物的压迫。可爱的读者像“学雷锋”一样在现实生活中推广和寻找我虚构出来的人物，闹出许多可哭可笑和哭笑不得的悲喜剧，使我有负疚感。我感到作家的责任太大，文学的自由太少。
    １９８３年，城市改革逐渐起步。大工业的改革不同于农村的分田到户。我所熟悉的工厂生活会变成什么样子？无法预测，没有把握，没有自信。与其勉强地拙劣地表达，不如知趣地沉默。更何况改革之势迅猛异常，“改革文艺”风起云涌，文坛已经热闹起来，少几个凑热闹的没有关系。尽管我在创作的时候最信赖的还是虚构，在观察和剖析生活时关心的却是现实，企图能把握现实的命运，在现实中找到自己的深度。让现实的深刻养育自己的思想，让现实的荒诞激发自己的想象力。工业题材是险象环生的。在企业里，生产活动中的关键人物，往往也处在各种矛盾的中心，他们多是领导干部。政策性强，时代感强，难以驾驭，有强烈的政治色彩，随生活的变化而变化。很难把中国这种特殊的政治变为美，至少比把其它生活变成美要难。把他们创造成有长久生命力的文学形象更难。自瓦特发明蒸汽机掀起第一次工业革命，至今快２００年了，剧烈地改变了世界的面貌，飞速地推进人类文明的进程。可是反映工业题材的巨著有多少？
    艺术家们心安理得地享受大工业的成果。对大工业又缺少应有的兴趣，甚至不屑一顾，摆出贵族对工人的傲慢（当前因经济原因主动跟企业家联姻是另一回事）。
    工业当然也是人类文化的产物，它包容着人的内涵。但人的形式肯定要被技术改变。六年前，雅克·艾吕尔的书给我造成的刺激至今还有印象——由现代科学技术武装并推动的工业，是一股强大的集权主义力量，它对人类生活进行脱胎换骨的改造，巧妙地侵入到生活的各个领域之中，形成一个不可抗拒的陌生的宇宙。它把自己的法则强加给世界并消灭一切反抗。自我长存，成指数增长，方向无法扭转，人的干预算不了什么，倒是人的选择必须要受到它的限制。它漠视文化和意识的差异，控制了经济的发展和社会的进步。人仍然是统治者，同时也受到技术的统治。贫穷、污染、战争、社会混乱，构成对人类的真正的打击力量，会使人逐渐地丧失原有的特性。怎样找到工业与人的价值？特别是在现代工业中发现人的价值？现代工业带来的现代物质文明，到底是工业的胜利，还是人的胜利？这些问题困扰着我不知该创作怎样的“工业人物”。
    扯远了。但这些都是我当时的真实想法。我需要暂时与工业题材拉开点“历史的距离”，对工业生活及自身进行一番感悟、自省和玩味。既然这是个“解构和重构”的时代，每个作家就不可能不思考，不怀疑，不探索，不否定，不重构。几年不写工业题材的小说，不等于跟工业题材“一刀两断”。我是来去自由的，笔跟工业拉开了距离，人并未拉开距离。命中注定要承担体验、观察和剖析工厂生活的角色。何况还有人不让我“逃离”工业题材呢？他们说我是工业题材的什么，是“改革文学”的什么。我受宠若惊，受之有愧。我写工业题材小说时还不知“改革”为何物，至今也搞不清“改革文学”的概念。中国的许多概念就是这样起哄式的想当然的产生的：工业题材等于改革，写工业题材就是写“改革”；写“改革”就是“改革文学”。“改革”本身还没有章法，“改革文学”的口号倒喊得震天价响，一轰而起，一窝蜂，中国又向来不缺赶大潮的和反潮流的勇士。于是既弄臭了“改革”，又弄臭了文学。人们一见到表现“改革”题材的文艺作品，先在心里打个问号。倘若不是实在没有别的东西好看是不愿问津的。
    我没有什么“主义”好谈，创作中主要是信任自己的直觉。我也找不到一种现成的理论能解释今天的社会时尚，能解释当代文学现状。理论再好也只能充当催生婆，现代理论雄心勃勃大有取代有情男女自己做产妇的架式。然而，工业题材仍然处于半禁区的状态。时髦人物、优雅潇洒之士、追求永恒的人物是不会光顾的。工业题材成了短命题材，吃力不讨好的题材。题材决定论者不喜欢它，说它决定失败。反对题材决定论的人也不喜欢它。真是“好汉子不干，赖汉子干不了”。尽管每个当代人的生活里都离不开现代工业产品，文学似乎离开工业社会仍能卓然独立。
    现代社会时尚是圆巧，是瘪熟、烂熟，不是饱满的成熟。文学想变成这种时尚的附庸，或者把自己变成一种新的时尚。会豁达，会玩世不恭，会深沉，会说话，会造句，会做人，会慵懒，会幽默，会尖刻，会漂亮，会享受……什么都会。可见贫困的不单是工业题材，是人的品格，是文学的品格，是社会的品格。当代作家愧对当代。享受当代可以，表现当代则显得捉襟见肘，力不从心。现实生活折磨当代文学就像上帝嘲笑萨烈瑞：“随处可见的聪明的庸才们，我只好赦免你们，阿门！”
    对不起，再回到工业题材的话题上来。你不要把离开工业题材和返回工业题材看得像过节日一样隆重。作家写哪一篇不是重新开始？这是最要命的。不管写什么都要调动自己的全部生活。写工业题材也不是只懂工厂生活就足够了。
    自然界存在盈虚起伏的法则。比如：呼吸吐纳，日夜更迭，冷暖交替，潮涨潮落，等等。写作的生活也要张弛有致，不断调节频率。这几年我发表了两部长篇小说，六部中篇小说和一批短文，轻松自由，心境平和。从南到北调查了许多企业，访问了许多企业家。我本人非常重视这几年的感受和收获，不是“带劲”或“不带劲”所能概括的。为什么又要“重返工业题材”？理由很简单，近两年对工厂生活恢复了感觉的自由。没有新鲜的感觉就离开，有了感觉再回去。我重视自己的感觉，而不是题材。我不认为题材对自己有决定意义。我不是大作家，我的作品也不可能永恒。因此我便没有包袱。套用娜娜·莫斯科莉的一句话：工业题材是我的毒品。
    在工业题材这片过去严肃的文学“领地”里，总有一种我不属于自己的感觉。首先想到的又是为同行们所不爱听的责任。目前是有作为有责任感的企业家和踏踏实实耕种的农民在支撑着中国艰难但还有希望的经济，国家找他们要税利，职工找他们要奖金，社会找他们要高质量的工业品和消费品，他们还要受到官倒、私倒以及各色经济造反派的夹迫——这经济造反派的破坏力不亚于“文化大革命”中的政治造反派。考虑到社会和经济的现状，企业的现状，职工的情绪，作家有哪些权利，没有哪些权利呢？无法回避对工业现实的困惑，也无法回避对社会道德危机的批判。
    我还要找回以前那种坚定昂扬的热情。但不想当“镜子”，也不能当“鞭子”。依据自己的心理格局重新找到审视和感知工业题材的文学视角。尤其应该勇于正视和改造精神现实，而不仅仅是真实地复制工厂生活。即使有酒精壮胆，我也没有说出对工业题材充满信心的豪言。因为还要清醒地估计到“工业题材对你是否也充满信心”？以全新的内容和全新的艺术形式，开辟一条工业题材的新路——谈何容易。
    还有一位批评家这样评价一部小说的优劣：人物形象深入人心的程度如何？是否能成为读者长期的精神伴侣？是否真正掌握了人们的思想？我猜新潮作家很可能对此标准嗤之以鼻。这标准对过去的大作家不算什么，对包括我在内的许多当代作家来说确乎是高不可攀。与其达不到，不如把标准本身给否了，骂它个狗血喷头。不要任何标准，重建自己的价值观念，或干脆不要价值观念。批判和扫荡是很省事的，但文学的扫荡永远都不会出现扫荡者希望出现的局面——身前身后一片白茫茫，唯他屹立。工业题材的标准是什么？文学的标准就是它的标准，不该再有新的标准。
    因为：小说的震撼力不是靠题材，而是表现题材的方式。我如果只在写大企业的时候才“雄浑”，才“带劲”，那“雄浑”和“带劲”的是大企业，而不是我。工业题材也未必就只能豪放，不能婉约。我倒以为，表现工业生活更需要细腻的感情，更需要痛快淋漓地发挥创造性想象，更需要体现当今社会的一种整体的灵魂。
    工业题材也无法回避这样一个事实：在当今这个多灾多难的地球上，经济落后的国家即便不会轻易沦为发达国家的政治殖民地，也必然会成为发达经济和现代科学技术的殖民地。人们舒舒服服地接受这个现实，享用现代人类的文化成果。社会形态变了，人们的心态变了，大企业就是大文化。从文学意义上说，题材的界限越来越模糊。文学不会再有“世袭领地”。
    我不向别人也不向自己许诺什么。正像通俗歌曲里唱的“跟着感觉走，牵着梦的手”。梦是没有用的，创作却不可无梦。如今尚在梦中，待梦醒了再来评说其吉凶祸福吧。
    话一扯开就收不住了。今天可没有酒精的成分。你烦了？困了？就此打住。愿你我都睡个好觉。
    握手！
