Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, March 17th.

Power-for-money deals have become the root of corruption in Hainan. Provincial Party Secretary Xu Shijie emphasized that Hainan must vigorously combat corruption.

“Do you want me to handle something for you? Bring money.” “Do you want me to sign a document for you? Bring money.” “Do you want allocated goods? Bring money.” In Hainan, exchanging power for money has become a prevalent corrupt practice. Xu Shijie demanded that Hainan’s efforts to build a clean government must address this core issue.

In the year since Hainan became a province and a special economic zone, it has achieved notable progress in opening up and revitalizing the economy. However, some lawbreakers have taken advantage of the transition between old and new systems to exchange power for money, fanning the winds of corruption. A certain so-called group company, with no money at all, managed to obtain a credit certificate worth 102 billion yuan and a license for a state-owned enterprise from the relevant departments. Some units do nothing substantial but make money by buying and selling approval documents. Moreover, some party members and cadres demand exorbitant sums from investors, causing many potential investors to leave and those already investing to face difficulties. Hainan’s development and construction have thus been disrupted and damaged, and social morals have been tarnished.

Regarding this, Xu Shijie emphasized at the provincial discipline inspection and supervision meeting that the special policies granted by the central government to Hainan are for the development of Hainan’s construction and do not allow anyone to illegally seek personal gain. The issue of exchanging power for money must be thoroughly investigated and the results of the investigation must be made public.

Xu Shijie stressed the importance of an open administration system and open administration results. Procedures, processes, and results that are prone to fraud and bribery must be made public. If they are not made public, the People’s Congress and the government, along with relevant departments, have the right to audit the accounts.

It is reported that the Hainan Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government have decided to first make public the allocation of loans, fertilizers, and construction projects. Some important approval documents will also be reviewed.

　　权钱交易　腐败根源  公开办事　治理之本
    许士杰强调海南大力肃贪
    本报海口３月１７日电  记者罗自苏报道：“你要我办事么，拿钱来。”“你要我批条子吗，拿钱来。”“你要牌价物资吗，拿钱来。”在海南，以权力和金钱做交易已成为风气腐败的根源。省委书记许士杰要求，海南抓廉政建设必须切中这一要害。
    海南建省办大特区一年来，开放搞活取得了明显成绩，但一些违法分子利用新旧体制交替之际，以权力与金钱做交换，刮起腐败之风。有一家所谓的集团公司根本没钱，居然在经办部门弄到１０２亿元的资信证明和全民所有制企业的执照；有的单位什么实事也不干，专靠买卖一纸批文赚钱。还有少数党员干部冲着投资者“狮子大开口”，不少来投资者打道回府，正在投资者也进退两难。海南的开发建设因此受到干扰破坏，社会风气也遭玷污。
    对此，许士杰在省纪检监察会议上强调指出，中央给海南的特殊政策，是用来发展海南的建设、不允许任何人非法谋利的。以权力与金钱作交易的问题，一定要查个水落石出，并公布清查结果。
    许士杰强调公开办事制度、公开办事结果，要将那些容易舞弊受贿的办事手续、过程和结果公布于众，如果不公开，人大、政府等有关部门有权查帐。
    据悉，海南省委、省政府已决定首批公布贷款、化肥和基建项目分配情况，一些重要批文也将清理。
