How many trophies can the Chinese team win at the upcoming 40th World Table Tennis Championships? Xu Yansheng and other table tennis authorities unanimously believe: it won't be "seven," nor will it be "zero."

Several experts recently held a discussion with reporters from the capital's sports media, analyzing the situation facing Chinese athletes in this World Table Tennis Championships. Xu Yansheng said, generally speaking, two phrases sum it up: there is hope, but there are also some concerns. The team's past experience shows that when both technical and mental aspects are well addressed, good results can be achieved. Currently, both aspects have some issues. In terms of technical play, our near-table fast attack has not seen new developments in recent years, and no new stars have emerged. When competing against foreign strong players, even if we win, it feels shaky.

Xu Yansheng believes that it is unlikely for Chinese athletes to make significant breakthroughs in technical play in a short period. However, through the recent closed training camp, some technical details have improved, such as improving the quality of serves and enhancing the ability to play long rallies. There will still be some progress.

When discussing the team's mental issues, Li Furong added that after Wu Shaozu, the director of the State Sports Commission, specially went to the Huangshi training base to give a motivational speech, the entire team responded positively. There is now a more unified understanding of previously confusing issues, such as how to view the relationship between individual and collective, whether to prioritize national interests, and how to handle the wind of going abroad.

Li Furong told the reporter that the team recently held an open tournament, and new players like Yu Shenpeng, Ma Wen'ge, and Deng Yaping performed well. Looking long-term, it is not feasible to continue without introducing new players. This time, the team will not rely solely on veterans; they plan to combine veterans with rookies. The specific lineup for the team competition has not been finalized yet.

Li Furong also pointed out that in recent years, table tennis players from various countries have consistently targeted China, aiming to defeat us. Apart from striving to improve their skills, they have come up with many other measures. For example, in this championship's doubles events, European athletes have broken national boundaries to optimize their pairing strategies, more than in previous editions. This significantly enhances their doubles strength.

Qiu Zhonghui, who works in sports research, also shared her views. She disagreed with Xu Yansheng's opinion that the women's team is fortunate this time and that the opponents' strength has weakened. She said that just because South Korea's Yang Young-ja might not participate, it does not mean the opponents are weak. In fact, Yang Young-ja is well-known and has been studied by us many times, making her easier to deal with. Instead, it is the lesser-known foreign newcomers who pose a greater threat to us.

　　中国队能夺几座奖杯？
    ——我乒乓权威谈第四十届世乒赛形势
    中国乒乓球队在即将开幕的第四十届世界乒乓球锦标赛上能拿几座奖杯？徐寅生等几位乒乓球界权威的一致看法是：不是“七”，也不是“○”。
    几位行家日前与首都体育记者座谈时，分析了这届世乒赛中国选手面临的形势。徐寅生说，总的看两句话：有希望，但又有点不妙。乒乓球队过去的经验是，当技术和思想两方面的问题都解决得比较好时，就能够取得较好成绩。目前恰恰两方面都存在一些问题。技术打法上，我们近台快攻这几年没有新发展，人员上也没有涌现新的尖子。与国外强手比赛，我们即使胜了也显得哆哆嗦嗦。
    徐寅生认为，中国选手短时间在技术打法上不大可能做到大的突破，但通过最近这段封闭式集训，一些技术具体环节处理好些，如提高发球质量，加强打相持球的能力，小的进步还是会有的。
    在谈起队里思想方面的问题时，李富荣接着说，最近国家体委主任伍绍祖专程去黄石训练基地做了动员报告以后，全队反映很好，对一些原来认识比较混乱的问题，如怎样看待个人与集体的关系，要不要以国家利益为重，怎样对待出国风等，现在认识比较一致。
    李富荣告诉记者，队里最近打了一次公开赛，于沈潼、马文革、邓亚萍等新手表现不错。从长远看，再不启用新手不行了，这次不会全用老将，准备以老带新，团体赛具体上谁队里还没有最后定下来。
    李富荣还指出，这些年各国乒乓好手一直把目标对准中国，力争打败我们。他们除了努力提高技术外，还想了不少其它措施，比如这一届锦标赛的双打项目，欧洲运动员纷纷打破国界优化组合配对，比过去历届都多。这样就大大提高了他们双打实力。
    从事体育科研工作的丘钟惠也谈了她的一些看法。她不同意徐寅生说的这次女队运气不错、对手实力减弱这种看法。她说，只看到南朝鲜的梁英子可能不参赛，就以为对手弱了是不对的。其实梁英子名气大，早被我们研究多少次了，反而好对付些。倒是那些名气不大的外国新秀给我们的威胁更大。
