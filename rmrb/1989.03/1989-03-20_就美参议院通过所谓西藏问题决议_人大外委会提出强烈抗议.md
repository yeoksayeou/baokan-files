On March 16, 1989, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution on the so-called Tibet issue. In response, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China issued a solemn statement today. The full text of the statement is as follows:

1. The U.S. Senate's resolution distorts the history and reality of China's Tibet Autonomous Region, defames the Chinese government's actions in Tibet as "suppression" and human rights violations, openly supports the violent acts of a few Tibetan separatists, and demands that the U.S. administration and international organizations interfere in Tibet's affairs. We express our strong indignation and protest against the U.S. Senate's blatant interference in China's internal affairs.

2. The recent events in Lhasa are neither ethnic nor religious issues, nor are they human rights issues. They are premeditated and intentional violent activities aimed at splitting the country, orchestrated by a few separatists. These individuals, under the banner of "Tibetan independence," have been engaging in acts of arson, looting, and even shooting at police and armed guards on duty, disrupting the normal social order and religious activities in Lhasa, and causing loss of life and property among the local people. They are far from being "unarmed protesters." Any sovereign state cannot tolerate such separatist violence. To maintain national unity, ensure social stability and the safety of citizens' lives and property, and protect public property from being damaged, the Chinese government has taken necessary measures. This is a completely legitimate sovereign act. After the imposition of martial law in Lhasa, the situation there quickly stabilized and returned to normal, which was welcomed by the local people. The facts have proven that the violent actions of a few separatists are unpopular.

3. It must be pointed out that a few individuals, under the guise of defending human rights, are engaging in separatist activities in an attempt to gain sympathy and support from foreign countries. Their goal is to restore the feudal serf system in Tibet. People will never forget that under the serf system in Tibet, the people had no basic personal freedom, let alone human rights. It was only after the democratic reforms and the abolition of the serf system that the Tibetan people enjoyed unprecedented democracy and freedom. Within the family of ethnic minorities, the legitimate rights and religious freedom of the Tibetan people are protected by the constitution. Over the past thirty years, the Tibet Autonomous Region has made significant progress in various fields such as politics, economy, and culture, and the living standards of the Tibetan people have been significantly improved, which is evident to all. To express sympathy and support for the disturbances created by a few Tibetan separatists is tantamount to supporting their attempt to restore the dark serf system in Tibet.

4. It is well known that Tibet is an inseparable part of China's territory, and the Tibet issue is China's internal affair. No foreign government, parliament, or international organization has the right to interfere. Any attempt to split China and undermine the unity of the Chinese nation, regardless of its origin, will be firmly opposed by the Chinese government and people. We are willing and prepared to hold talks with the Dalai Lama, but only on the premise of maintaining national unity. Tibetan independence is out of the question, semi-independence is out of the question, and disguised independence is also out of the question. The U.S. Senate's resolution, which demands that the U.S. government and international organizations interfere in China's Tibet affairs, is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people.

5. Over the past ten years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, the two countries have made significant progress in their relations. Further development of this friendly relationship is in the fundamental interests and wishes of the people of both countries. The 1982 Sino-U.S. Joint Communiqué clearly states that mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs are the fundamental principles guiding the relations between the two countries. We hope that the U.S. Congress, in the interest of maintaining the overall situation of Sino-U.S. relations, will stop all activities that interfere in China's internal affairs.

### 就美参议院通过所谓西藏问题决议　人大外委会提出强烈抗议

　　就美参议院通过所谓西藏问题决议
    人大外委会提出强烈抗议
    新华社北京３月１９日电  １９８９年３月１６日，美国国会参议院通过一项所谓西藏问题的决议。对此，中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会外事委员会今天发表严正声明。声明全文如下：
    一、美国国会参议院这一决议歪曲中国西藏自治区的历史和现实，污蔑中国政府在西藏实行“镇压”和侵犯人权，公然支持西藏少数分裂主义分子的暴行，要求美国行政当局和国际组织插手西藏事务。对美国国会参议院这种粗暴干涉中国内政的行为，我们表示极大的愤慨并提出强烈的抗议。
    二、最近在拉萨发生的事件，既不是民族、宗教问题，更不是人权问题，而是少数分裂主义分子预谋和蓄意制造的分裂祖国的暴力活动。这些人打着“西藏独立”的旗帜，到处打、砸、抢、烧，甚至向执勤的公安武警开枪射击，破坏了拉萨的正常社会秩序和宗教活动，造成了当地人民的生命财产损失。他们根本不是什么“手无寸铁的示威者”。而对于这种分裂主义的暴力行为，任何主权国家都是不能容忍的。为维护国家统一、保障社会安定和公民的人身财产安全以及保护公共财产不受侵犯，中国政府采取了必要的措施。这是完全正当的主权行为。拉萨实行戒严后，那里的局势很快平静下来，恢复正常，受到了当地人民的欢迎。事实证明，少数分裂主义分子的暴力行为是不得人心的。
    三、必须指出，少数人打着维护人权的幌子制造分裂活动，企图得到外国的同情和支持，其目的是要在西藏恢复封建农奴制度。人们永远不会忘记，在农奴制下的西藏人民，连最起码的人身自由都没有，哪里有什么“人权”可言。正是在实行民主改革、摆脱了农奴制之后，西藏人民才享受到从未有过的广泛民主和自由。在民族大家庭中，西藏人民的正当权益和宗教信仰自由受到宪法的保障。三十年来西藏自治区在政治、经济、文化等各个领域取得了显著进步，西藏人民的生活水平得到了明显提高，这是有目共睹的。对西藏少数分裂主义者制造骚乱表示同情和支持，不能不使人认为实际要支持他们在西藏恢复黑暗的农奴制度。
    （⑴⑵）四、众所周知，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，西藏问题，是中国的内政，任何外国政府、议会或国际组织都无权干涉。任何分裂中国、破坏中华民族团结的行为，无论来自何处，都将遭到中国政府和中国人民的坚决反对。我们愿意并准备同达赖喇嘛举行谈判，但要在维护祖国统一的前提下进行，西藏独立不行，半独立不行，变相独立也不行。美国参议院的决议竟然要求美国政府和国际组织插手中国西藏事务，这是中国人民绝对不能接受的。
    五、中美建交十年来，两国关系取得了显著进展。进一步发展这种友好关系，符合两国人民的根本利益和愿望。１９８２年的中美联合公报明确指出：互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不干涉内政是指导两国关系的根本原则。我们希望美国国会从维护中美关系的大局出发，停止一切干涉中国内政的活动。
