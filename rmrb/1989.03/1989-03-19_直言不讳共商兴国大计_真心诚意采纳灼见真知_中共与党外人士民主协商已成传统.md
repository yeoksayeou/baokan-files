Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 17th.

The Communist Party of China (CPC) has established a good tradition of democratic consultation with leaders of various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-partisan patriotic figures on important national issues.

According to incomplete statistics, since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC, there have been 28 democratic consultation meetings and symposiums held by the main leaders of the CPC Central Committee with leaders of various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-partisan patriotic figures. The depth and breadth of these consultations have significantly expanded.

Over the past decade, the CPC Central Committee has sought opinions from various quarters on many major policies, important personnel arrangements, and related important issues, or briefed them on the situation and exchanged views. The consultation topics have covered economic system reform, political system reform, scientific and technological system reform, educational system reform, spiritual civilization construction, price and wage reform, the CPC's rectification campaign, relevant situations of important CPC conferences, and united front issues.

At these symposiums and consultation meetings, leaders of various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-partisan patriotic figures have spoken frankly and openly, presenting their views and suggestions with a spirit of mutual trust. The CPC has genuinely listened to and adopted their insights and wisdom, creating a harmonious and united atmosphere.

Leaders of various democratic parties have welcomed the CPC's practice of democratic consultation. Chairman of the Chinese Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD) Consultative Committee, Sun Xiaocun, who is over eighty years old, said at a symposium, "The multiple democratic consultation meetings show that the CPC Central Committee is genuinely consulting with non-party figures. Some non-party figures believe that the form of democratic consultation meetings is good, and the content of consultations has become increasingly deep and rich over the years."

The CPC's democratic consultation with various democratic parties and non-partisan figures on major national policies has not only become a good tradition at the central level but also in various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. Some provincial, autonomous regional, and municipal CPC committees have specially drafted relevant articles on the democratic consultation system, making it institutionalized. Some provinces and autonomous regions have also issued documents instructing municipal and county CPC committees to formulate corresponding consultation systems.

　　直言不讳共商兴国大计  真心诚意采纳灼见真知
    中共与党外人士民主协商已成传统
    据新华社北京３月１７日电  中共中央就国家的重要问题与各民主党派、全国工商联负责人和无党派爱国人士进行民主协商，已形成良好传统。
    据不完全统计，党的十一届三中全会以来，由中共中央主要负责人出面与各民主党派、全国工商联负责人和无党派爱国人士举行的民主协商会、座谈会已达２８次。协商对话的深度和广度有了很大发展。
    十年来，中共中央就国家许多大政方针、重大人事安排和有关重要问题，征求各方面人士的意见或向他们通报情况，交换意见。协商的内容涉及到经济体制改革、政治体制改革、科技体制改革、教育体制改革、精神文明建设、物价工资改革、中共整党活动、中共重要会议的有关情况以及统一战线问题等。
    在这些座谈会、协商会上，各民主党派、全国工商联负责人和无党派爱国人士本着肝胆相照的精神，直言不讳地提出自己的意见和建议，中国共产党真心诚意地听取和采纳他们的真知灼见，协商呈现出团结和谐的气氛。
    各民主党派负责人对于共产党同他们进行民主协商的做法得到发展表示欢迎。年过八旬的民建中央咨议委员会主席孙晓村在一次座谈会上说：“多次民主协商会表明，中共中央是真心诚意地同党外人士协商的。一些党外人士认为，民主协商会的形式很好，几年来协商的内容不断深入和丰富。”
    中共同各民主党派、无党派人士就国家大政方针进行民主协商，不仅在中央，而且在各省、自治区、直辖市，都形成了良好的传统。一些省、自治区、直辖市的中共党委，已专门拟定了有关民主协商制度的条文，使之制度化。有些省、自治区还发文责成各市、县党委也制定相应的协商制度。
