The first National Billiards Individual Open Competition has entered the semi-finals. Our reporter, Li Beida, reports from Beijing on March 5th: From playing on makeshift tables in alleys to donning formal suits and competing in a modern sports hall prepared for the Asian Games, for some young players, this is truly an honorable affair. The "Anjiu Ruanhe Qixing Cup" National Billiards Individual Open Competition, which began on March 1st, has now completed its first stage. A total of 75 players have advanced to the semi-finals in the Snooker and 16-ball events.

The participants come from various walks of life and are competing as individuals. Before the competition, the organizers were quite concerned about management issues. However, after several days of competition, it was evident that the over 200 participants adhered to discipline, respected the referees, and maintained a good order of competition. Most players demonstrated standardized techniques. The youngest participant, Mu Xiaoxuan from Tianjin, is only 6 and a half years old. Although he lost both of his matches, he still played several impressive shots that received praise from experts and was well-received. Notable Chinese billiards players such as Wang Zong, Wang Lin, Wang Lanying, and Lin Tao from Beijing were unexpectedly eliminated by several newcomers. These upsets, along with the news that several players from Xinjiang have advanced to the semi-finals, have also surprised the experts.

The second stage of the semi-finals will begin on the 6th. The top 20 players in both events will be decided on the 8th and 9th, and the competition will become even more intense.

　　首届全国台球个人公开赛进入复赛
    本报北京３月５日讯  记者李北大报道：昔日在街头巷尾玩“野台子”消遣，如今换上笔挺的西装、走进为亚运会准备的现代化体育馆正儿八经地参加全国比赛，这对一些小青年们来说，还真是荣耀的事情。从３月１日开幕的“安酒·柔和七星杯”全国台球个人公开赛至今已结束了第一阶段比赛，共有７５人进入司诺克和１６球两项比赛的复赛。
    参加比赛的选手来自社会各个阶层，而且是以个人名义，赛前组织者十分担心比赛不好管理。几天赛事表明，２００多名选手遵守纪律，服从裁判，竞赛秩序井然。大部分选手动作规范，年龄最小的天津选手穆小轩只有６岁半，两场比赛虽然都失利，但仍打出很多令行家赞扬的漂亮球，受到好评。北京的王宗、王林、王兰英、蔺涛等我国台球名将大意失荆州，被几位新手淘汰。这些冷门与新疆几名选手跻入复赛的消息同样令行家们感到意外。
    第二阶段复赛从６日开始展开，８、９日将决出两项比赛的前２０名，竞争将更为激烈。
