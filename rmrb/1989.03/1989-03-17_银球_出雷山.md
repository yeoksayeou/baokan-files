The Leigong Mountain, part of the Miao Mountains, stretches across the northeastern part of Leishan County, Guizhou. Its main peak stands at 2,179 meters above sea level. It is named Leigong Mountain because it is often shrouded in clouds and mist, and thunderstorms frequently occur in the valleys.

We set out from the county seat and climbed along the winding mountain paths. Gazing around, we saw only layer upon layer of mountains, dense forests, cascading waterfalls, and ancient trees hanging upside down. As we ascended, the mist thickened, sometimes reducing visibility to just a few meters. When we reached the 1,400-meter mark, the mist suddenly cleared, and we found ourselves in a lush green tea garden. Row upon row of neatly pruned tea trees followed the contours of the mountain. Some slopes were almost vertical, a testament to the hard work of the original cultivators. This is the birthplace of the famous "Silver Ball Tea"—the Juesan Tea Plantation.

Silver Ball Tea is a type of green tea. It appears spherical, about the size of a child's glass marble, each weighing 2.5 grams. When brewing, one ball is used per cup. As the hot water is poured, the ball gradually unfolds into whole tea leaves. The leaves are thick and tender, the tea water is a light yellow and clear, and it has a rich aroma with a slight sweetness. Even after brewing four or five times, the lingering fragrance remains strong, making it a premium tea.

The workers at the Juesan Tea Plantation are mostly Miao women. They told us that the high altitude, abundant rainfall, diffuse light, and large temperature differences between day and night all contribute to the excellent natural quality of the tea leaves. In 1982, the former director, Mao Kexu, and others decided to change the situation where Leishan lacked famous teas. They aimed to create a spherical tea different from the loose, pressed, and brick teas on the market. They selected high-quality green tea with one bud and two leaves, carefully selecting and processing it. Utilizing the abundant gum in the tender leaves, without adding any additives, they handcrafted the spherical tea. After its release, Silver Ball Tea was loved by everyone and quickly entered the market. A foreign embassy in Beijing even traveled to Guizhou to acquire this tea. Previously, Juesan tea leaves were sold for only 8-9 yuan per kilogram, but Silver Ball Tea was priced at 74 yuan per kilogram. Both Silver Ball Tea and Tianma Tea, created by the Juesan Tea Factory, were awarded "Provincial Excellent" and "Ministry Excellent" products.

The emergence of "Silver Ball" from Leishan has opened up new avenues for Leishan County to utilize its natural advantages and overcome poverty.

In Leishan County's population of 123,000, 82% are Miao. The isolation of the "Nine-Mountain Range" has kept the county's total industrial and agricultural output value at only 30.88 million yuan, a mere 40% increase over the past decade. Currently, 30% of households still struggle to meet basic food needs. County Party Secretary and Miao cadre Lu Dingzhou told me, "To shake off poverty, Leishan needs to develop industry, grain production, and forestry. However, given the county's terrain of nine mountains, half water, and half fields, accelerating the development of diverse agricultural and sideline products and processing industries seems to be the fastest way to help the Miao people escape poverty. Among these, tea production holds the most promise."

In his book "The Classic of Tea," Tang Dynasty tea sage Lu Yu discussed the relationship between tea quality and soil, stating: "The best tea grows on rotten rocks, the middle grade on gravel, and the lowest on yellow soil." The term "rotten rocks" refers to the sandy yellow soil formed by the weathering of sandstone, which is precisely the soil characteristic of Leigong Mountain. After visiting Leishan, experts from the Guizhou Tea Research Institute joyfully pointed out: "Leishan has no limestone and no alkaline soil, a rare condition in the province and the country suitable for tea cultivation." The warm and humid climate of Leigong Mountain is not ideal for grain production but is very beneficial for tea trees. Leishan's tea gardens are mostly in forest environments, basically free from pollution. Their conclusion is: Leishan tea is destined to be extraordinary.

Leishan County began planting tea in 1973, accumulating 6,000 mu of tea gardens over the years. In the past, due to lack of leadership attention and frequent system changes, many tea gardens were abandoned and neglected. By 1987, the total tea production was still less than that of a slightly larger township tea plantation in Zunyi County. In recent years, the county established a tea leadership group, with the county party secretary as the head. After a year of hard work, they reclaimed most of the old tea gardens and opened up an additional 1,900 mu. Last year, the county produced nearly 20,000 kilograms of tea, an 84% increase over the previous year. The county plans to build a base for famous, high-quality, and special green tea with 10,000 mu of tea gardens in the near future.

To help as many Miao people as possible escape poverty, the current director of the county's beverage and food factory, Mao Kexu, took new measures: starting in 1987, he signed contracts with several of the poorest Miao townships, encouraging farmers to plant tea on marginal land. For every 500 seedlings planted, the factory provides seeds and a certain amount of mixed fertilizer free of charge, and during the tea picking season, the factory sets up collection points to purchase the tea and ensures on-the-spot payment in cash. He also dispatched 12 technical personnel to provide technical guidance. Under this "leading dragon," over 3,600 households have planted tea trees, accounting for 70% of the total households in these townships. Old Mao told me, "If a household plants 500 seedlings, by 1990, they can earn at least 60,000 yuan. By 1993, when the tea trees enter their high-yield period, production can increase threefold, which is a reliable and substantial income."

The man praised as the "pioneer of Leigong Mountain," Old Mao, has an even deeper thought: "To protect the ecological environment of Leigong Mountain, simply prohibiting people from cutting trees indiscriminately is not enough. If the Miao people have no other way to make money besides cutting trees, Leigong Mountain will inevitably face the fate of being stripped bare. Our factory, in addition to making tea, also develops more than 30 kinds of beverages, jams, and canned foods using the mountain's natural resources such as kiwifruit, bamboo shoots, Chinese bayberries, and cordyceps. Since 1984, we have paid farmers 1.45 million yuan through the purchase of mountain delicacies."

Leigong Mountain gave birth to Silver Ball Tea, and Silver Ball Tea carries the hopes of Leigong Mountain.

### “银球”出雷山

　　“银球”出雷山
    本报记者  朱维群
    雷公山，属苗岭山脉，横亘于贵州雷山县东北境，主峰海拔２１７９米。因它终年云遮雾裹，山间经常雷电交加，故得此名。
    我们从县城出发攀援在山上的羊肠小路上，极目四望，唯见重峦叠嶂，林木幽深，飞瀑漱石，古木倒悬。随着山势增高，云雾渐浓，有时能见度不过数尺。上到海拔１４００米的山腰，云雾忽散，我们已置身于一片碧绿的茶园中了。一排排修剪齐整的茶树依山势而植，有的坡地几乎近于直立，可以想见当初开垦者的艰辛。这里就是雷公山一绝“银球茶”的发源地—觉散茶场。
    银球茶属绿茶类，外观呈球状，大小有如孩子玩的玻璃弹球，每颗重２．５克。饮用时每杯一颗，冲开水后圆球渐渐伸展为片片完整的茶叶。叶片肉厚而鲜嫩，茶水微黄而清澈，饮之醇香而微甜，冲上四五遍水后余香尤浓，真是茶中精品。
    觉散茶场职工多为苗家，而且大多是妇女。他们告诉我，这里海拔高，雨量充沛，漫射光多，昼夜温差大，茶叶自然品质特好。１９８２年，老场长毛克翕等决心改变雷山缺少名茶的状况，琢磨着创一种不同于市场现有的散茶、坨茶、砖茶的球状茶。他们选一芽二叶初展的高档青茶，环环精选、精制，又利用嫩叶胶质丰富的特点，不加任何添加剂，以手工制成球状。银球茶问世后，人见人爱，很快打入市场。某外国驻华使馆为了购得此茶，从北京一直寻访到贵州。觉散茶叶过去不过八、九元一公斤，而银球茶则上升到７４元一公斤，并同觉散茶厂创制的天麻茶双双被评为“省优”、“部优”产品。
    “银球”出雷山，开阔了雷山县利用自然优势战胜贫穷的思路。
    在雷山县１２．３万人口中，苗族占８２％。“九万大山”的封闭，使全县工农业总产值迄今不过３０８８万元，比１０年前仅增长４０％。目前尚有３０％的农户未能解决温饱问题。县委书记、苗族干部陆定洲对我说：“雷山要摆脱贫穷，工业、粮食、林业都离不了。但是根据全县九山半水半分田的特点，加快发展多种农副产品的种植业和加工业，看来是帮助苗族群众尽快脱贫的捷径。其中，又以茶叶生产最有希望。”
    被民间尊为茶神的唐代陆羽在他所著的《茶经》中论及茶叶品质与土壤的关系时说：“上者生烂石，中者生砾壤，下者生黄土。”所谓烂石，系指砂页岩风化形成的砂质黄壤，这恰恰是雷公山的土壤特征。贵州省茶研所专家来雷山考察后欣喜地指出：雷山全县找不到一片石灰岩，找不到一块碱性土，这是全省和全国都少有的宜茶土壤。雷公山的温湿气候对粮食生产不够理想，对茶树却十分有利。雷山茶园多在森林环境中，基本上无污染。他们的结论是：雷山茶注定不同凡响。
    雷山县１９７３年才种茶，历年积累茶园６０００亩。过去由于领导不重视、体制又多变动，不少茶园丢荒失管。到１９８７年茶叶总产量尚不及遵义县一个稍大的乡村茶场。近年县里成立茶叶领导小组，县委书记任组长，苦干一年，除垦复了大部分老茶园，又新辟１９００多亩。去年全县产茶近２万公斤，比上年增８４％。县里计划近年内在全县建成有万亩茶园的名优特绿茶基地。
    为了带动尽可能多的苗族群众脱贫，现任县饮料食品厂厂长的毛克翕又采取了新措施：从１９８７年起同几个最贫穷的苗族乡签定合同，鼓励农民利用地角田边种茶。凡种满５００窝的，厂里无偿给予种籽和一定数量混合肥，采茶时节厂里负责设点收购并保证当场付给现金。他还派出１２名技术人员专职负责技术指导。在这个“龙头”带领下，已有３６００多户种下茶树，占这几个乡总农户的７０％。老毛对我说：“一户种５００窝，到１９９０年至少可收入６０万元，到１９９３年茶树进入高产期，产量可增加三倍，这是一笔不小的可靠收入。”
    被人们誉为“雷公山的开拓者”的老毛，还有一层更深的想法：“保护雷公山生态环境，单纯靠禁止群众乱砍乱伐还不够。如果苗族群众除了砍树没有其他找钱的路子，雷公山终难逃砍伐一空的厄运。我们厂除了制茶叶，还利用山上的天然资源开发出猕猴桃、竹笋、杨梅、天麻等二三十种饮料、果酱、罐头等食品，１９８４年以来通过收购山鲜付给农民１４５万元。”
    雷公山孕育出银球茶，银球茶寄托着雷公山的希望。
