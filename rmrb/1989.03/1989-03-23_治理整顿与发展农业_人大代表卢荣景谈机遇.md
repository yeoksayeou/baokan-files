Last winter and this spring, Anhui Province alone invested over 10 million laborers in agricultural water conservancy projects, completing over 400 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. It has been many years since we have seen such fervent water conservancy construction!” – This is the information provided by People's Congress Representative Lu Rongjing during the discussion on Premier Li Peng's government work report. This member of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Governor said:

“Reducing fixed asset investments and canceling a batch of ongoing projects is also one of the goals of rectification and adjustment. On one hand, it drives a large number of migrant workers away from construction sites of buildings and halls, making the surplus labor force in rural areas even more redundant. On the other hand, it also creates an opportunity to strengthen the human resources input in the agricultural frontline, turning troubles into blessings to some extent.”

“While suppressing the total social demand, we are also striving to increase effective supply; this is also one of the goals of rectification. Effective supply primarily refers to important agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, and oil. Obviously, while the state is tightening monetary policy, it will also do everything possible to ensure the supply of funds for agriculture. For a major producer of grain, cotton, silk, and pork – Anhui – this undoubtedly presents an opportunity for national investment to tilt towards the Jianghuai region. The State Council decided that starting from April 1st this year, the purchase price of contracted grain will be increased by an average of 18%. Just this measure alone will allow Anhui farmers to earn an additional 1.5 billion yuan!”

“Compared to other industries, Anhui's agricultural production has not only not been very ‘hot’ in recent years but has even been a bit ‘cold.’ One of the goals of rectification and adjustment is precisely to solve the problem of lagging agricultural development. This gives Anhui the opportunity to turn ‘imbalanced cold and hot’ into ‘appropriately balanced cold and hot.’ Currently, the province's over 90 million mu of grain fields have a yield rate lower than the national average; over 70 million mu of cultivable water areas have 30% lying fallow; over 20 million mu of barren hills and slopes have 31.2% not well developed. With the entire Party and the people genuinely strengthening the foundational position of agriculture in the national economy, these production and resource potentials will turn into wealth.”

　　治理整顿与发展农业        
    ——人大代表卢荣景谈机遇

    “去冬今春，安徽仅在农田水利建设上就投入了１０００多万个劳动力，完成的土石方达４亿多立方米。好多年没看到这么热火的兴修水利了！”——这是人大代表卢荣景在讨论李鹏总理政府工作报告时提供的消息。这位中共安徽省委书记、省长说：
    “压缩固定资产投资，砍掉一批在建项目，这也是治理整顿的目标之一，它一方面促使大批民工离开楼堂馆所工地，使农村多余劳动力更加多余；另一方面也造就了加强农业第一线人力投入的机遇，麻烦事也会在一定程度上变成好事。”
    “在抑制社会总需求的同时，努力增加有效供给，这也是治理的目标之一；而有效供给首先是指粮棉油等重要农副产品。显然，国家在紧缩银根之际也要千方百计保证农业资金供应。这对于粮食、棉花、蚕丝、生猪等紧缺农副产品生产大户——安徽来说，无疑有了国家投资要向江淮大地倾斜的机遇。国务院决定从今年４月１日起，将合同定购粮食的收购价格平均提高１８％。仅此一项，安徽农民就可多得１５亿元呢！”
    “和其他行业比较，近年来安徽的农业生产不但不怎么‘热’相反还有点儿‘冷’。治理整顿的目标之一，正是要解决农业发展滞后的问题。这就使安徽有了变‘冷热失调’为‘冷热适度’的机遇。目前全省９０００多万亩粮田，产出率低于全国平均水平；７００多万亩可养水面，有３０％在撂荒；２０００多万亩荒山荒坡，有３１．２％没有很好开发。随着全党全民切实加强农业在国民经济中的基础地位，这些生产和资源潜力将会变成财富。”
