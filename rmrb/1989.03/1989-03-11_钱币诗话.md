The earliest instance of money entering poetry can be found in the "Mang" chapter of the "Book of Songs": "Mang, the simple fellow, carries cloth to barter for silk. It is not to barter for silk, but to seek me out." Here, cloth can be seen as the prototype of money.

China's currency has a long history. Cowrie shells were the earliest form of currency in China. The "Book of Songs" contains the line "Grant me a hundred friends." At that time, cowrie shells were counted in units of "friends," with two strings of 10 or 20 shells called one friend. By the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, China had various main currencies such as cloth, knives, and coins. Therefore, poets' works also included new coin-related poetry. For example, Zhao Junsheng of the Western Han Dynasty wrote, "A man values righteousness, why use coins and knives?"; the Tang Dynasty poet Liu Yuxi wrote, "The power is divided among the three tripods, the business changes with the five copper coins"; the Northern Song Dynasty poet Mei Yaochen wrote, "Next, observe the gold-inlaid knife, one knife is worth five knives," and so on. In the fourth year of Wude, the appearance of Kaiyuan Tongbao marked a new milestone in China's currency history and was used continuously until the fall of the Qing Dynasty.

However, money has a dual nature. The Ming Dynasty painter Shen Zhou clearly explained the merits and demerits of money in his poem "Reciting Poetry": "This tiny body can handle all matters, like a spring flowing deeply with benefits. It can fairly price goods in the market, and when it floods, children have a loving heart." Nevertheless, throughout history, poems about money have mostly criticized it, cursing the evils of "money can move gods" and "no money, no justice in the court." The Qing Dynasty poet Yuan Mei wrote, "The emperor's words remain, but people's affairs are left to the brother." Here, "brother" is another name for money, known as Kongfang Xiong. Yuan Mei's poem deeply exposes the phenomenon of money's omnipotence. For example, the Tang Dynasty poet Li He wrote, "The elm buds urge each other without knowing the count, Shen Lang's green coins fill the city roads," sarcastically mocking the actions of Shen Chong during the Eastern Jin Dynasty, who minted light coins that flooded the market and deceived the common people.

It is worth mentioning that the various coins have also become a source of joy for collectors. The Qing Dynasty scholar Li Guangting was a passionate collector of ancient coins and had a close relationship with "Kongfang Xiong," often mentioning them in his poems. Once, a friend of his acquired a Guangzhong Tongbao ancient coin and asked Li Guangting for a poem. Li was stumped because the coin was not recorded in the "Coin Catalog," and he did not know when or where it was minted. He lamented that it was a difficult topic, but ultimately he wrote a long poem, which included the lines: "I happened to meet the Kongfang brother, and first recognized the Guangzhong brother. With one coin, he gave it to me, wanting me to speak at length." He directly referred to the coin as "brother," which was a novel association. For example, 50 years ago, the famous ancient coin collector and researcher Fang Dishan, when his daughter got married and did not have enough dowry, gave her a rare ancient coin as a gift. He also wrote a couplet, which read: "Two young hearts without suspicion, one ancient coin seals the betrothal; four directions in trouble, three cups of wine seal the marriage." The couplet was well-matched and was once famous.

　　钱币诗话
    林集
    以钱入诗，最早见于《诗经·氓》中“氓之蚩蚩，抱布贸丝。匪来贸丝，来即我谋。”这里的布可以看作当时钱币的雏型。
    我国的货币有着悠久的历史。贝，是我国最早的货币。《诗经》就有“赐我百朋”的诗句。当时，贝以“朋”为计算单位，两串１０个或２０个叫一朋。到了春秋战国，我国出现了布、刀、钱等主要货币。因此，诗人笔下又有了新的钱币诗话。如西汉卓文君的“男儿重义气，何用钱刀为”；唐代大诗人刘禹锡的“势分三足鼎，业变五铢钱”；北宋诗人梅尧臣的“次观金错刀，一刀平五刀”等等。武德四年，开元通宝的出现，在我国货币史上开创了一个新的里程碑，并一接沿用到清朝灭亡。
    然而，钱币也有两重性。明代画家沈周在《吟诗》诗中，把货币的功过说得很明白，诗曰：“个许微躯万事任，似泉流动利源深。平章市物无偏价，泛滥儿童有爱心。”不过，历代咏钱诗文，对钱币还是以贬居多，诅咒“钱能通神”、“有理无钱莫进衙”等弊端。清朝诗人袁枚吟诗诗云：“一代帝王留字去，万般人事让兄骄。”这里的“兄”即是钱币的别称，叫孔方兄。袁枚此诗深刻揭露了金钱万能的现象。又如，唐代诗鬼李贺写的“榆荚相催不知数，沈郎青钱夹城路”，辛辣地讽刺了东晋时沈充所铸轻钱充斥市场、欺骗庶民的行径。
    值得一提的是，五花八门的钱币又成了收藏家的乐趣。清朝文人李光庭是个古钱收藏迷，与“孔方兄”关系非常密切，入诗也多。一次，他的文友得一光中通宝古钱，向李光庭索诗。李苦于《钱谱》没有载，不知何时何地铸造，自叹是拈窘之题，但最终还是赋一长诗，其中有云：“适逢孔方子，初识光中兄。一文持遗我，欲我长言赓。世系不可考，羌无故实微。”他直称此钱为“兄”，可谓联想新奇。又如，５０年前著名的古钱收藏研究专家方地山，其女出嫁不备妆奁，仅以一珍稀古钱为礼，并自作对联一副，上联“两小无猜，一个古钱先下定”；下联“四方多难，三杯淡酒便成亲。”对仗工整，一时传为美谈。
