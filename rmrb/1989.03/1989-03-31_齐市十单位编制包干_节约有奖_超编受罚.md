Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 29th.

Ten direct-subordinate units in Qiqihaer City, Heilongjiang Province, have signed fixed personnel quota contracts with the city government based on their established quotas. These contracts stipulate rewards for savings and penalties for excesses, with a one-time settlement at the end of the year. If all ten units can fulfill their contracts by the end of the year, it is estimated that the state can save over 130,000 yuan in administrative expenses, and the ten units can receive a total of 57,000 yuan in bonuses.

The contracts specify that during the fixed quota period, while completing their work tasks, each unit that saves one personnel quota will receive a reward of 1,500 yuan from the city's finance department. For each excess personnel, 10% of the salaries of the unit's leading members will be deducted.
