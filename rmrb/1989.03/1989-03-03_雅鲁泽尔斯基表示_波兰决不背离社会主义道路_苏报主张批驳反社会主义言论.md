	Jaruzelski States Poland Will Not Deviate from the Socialist Path
	Pravda Advocates Refuting Anti-Socialist Statements

	New Xinhua News Agency Warsaw, March 1 - The First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, Jaruzelski, recently stated in a speech that no one can make Polish communists "deviate from the socialist path."

	This Polish leader made the above statement at a party organization meeting held in the military on February 27. His speech was published today in the "People's Tribune."

	Jaruzelski pointed out in his speech: "If someone wants us to abandon the socialist path, then I advise them to give up this idea."

	The Polish leader condemned the extreme opposition's denial of the history of the People's Republic of Poland and martial law. He said that the current socialist reforms and changes are a continuation of the people's past history, and that the implementation of martial law in 1981 was "necessary." Without martial law, there would be no stability in the country and the current "Round Table Conference."

	Jaruzelski also criticized some people for being politically indecisive, saying that this "independence" is actually another form of dependence.

	When talking about the current domestic situation in Poland, he said that the lives of the Polish people are difficult and unstable, but the Polish people are "experiencing a great era of rapid change."

	New Xinhua News Agency Moscow, March 1 - The Soviet Union's "Pravda" published an article by the Director of the Marxism-Leninism Institute of the CPSU Central Committee, Smirnov, on March 1, stating that the anti-socialist views appearing in the press should be refuted.

	Smirnov expressed in the article that the influence of "left" and "right" forces on the reform should not be underestimated. Some people, when commenting on historical issues, completely deny the socialist nature of the Soviet Union. "They doubt the socialist future of the Soviet Union and doubt the reality and vitality of Marx's theory of socialism."

	He also criticized the central press for not daring to refute the above statements. He believed that "this passive stance means surrender in political thought. It will also lose the important feature of pluralism - the debate of opinions."

	This academician believed that socialist pluralism should promote the constructive study of Lenin's concepts on socialism, ownership forms, opposition to bureaucracy, development of new management forms, and cooperation, among other important issues.

    雅鲁泽尔斯基
    表示波兰决不背离社会主义道路
    苏报主张批驳反社会主义言论
    新华社华沙3月1日电  波兰统一工人党中央第一书记雅鲁泽尔斯基目前在讲话中说，任何人也不能使波兰共产党人“背离社会主义道路”。
    这位波兰领导人是2月27日在军队召开的一次党组织会议上作上述表示的。他的讲话今日刊登在《人民论坛报》上。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基在讲话中指出：“如果有人想要我们放弃社会主义道路，那末奉劝他还是打消这一念头为好”。
    波兰领导人谴责了极端反对派否定人民波兰历史和军管的言论。他说，现在的社会主义革新和改革是过去人民历史的继续，1981年实行军管是“必要的”，没有军管就没有国家的稳定和现在的“圆桌会议”。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基还批评有些人在政治上动摇不定，说这种随风倒、“标榜独立性”，实际上“是另一种依赖性”。
    在谈到当前波兰国内形势时他说，波兰人民的生活是困难的和不平静的，但是波兰人民“正经历着一个瞬间万变的伟大时代”。
    新华社莫斯科3月1日电苏联《真理报》1日发表苏共中央马列主义研究所所长斯米尔诺夫的文章，认为应对报刊上出现的反社会主义观点进行批驳。
    斯米尔诺夫在文章中表示，不能低估“左”和“右”的势力对改革的影响，有人在评论历史问题时，完全否定苏联的社会主义性质。“他们怀疑苏联的社会主义前途，怀疑马克思关于社会主义理论的现实性和生命力。”
    他还批评中央报刊不敢对上述言论进行批驳。他认为，“这种静观的立场意味着政治思想上的投降。而且也会丧失意见多元化的重要特点——意见争论。”
    这位院士认为，社会主义多元化应该促进建设性地研究列宁关于社会主义的概念、所有制形式、反对官僚主义、发展新的经营形式和合作制等重要问题。
