	Reward the Meritorious, Punish the Guilty:
	Western Film Studio Takes a Hard Line on Filming Discipline

	New China News Agency, Xi'an, March 2 (Reporter: Bu Yun Tong) A free and easy attitude seems to be commonplace in the arts world. However, Wu Tianming, the director of the Xi'an Film Studio, does not simply view these as the artistic flair and romanticism of artists. On March 1, at a meeting of all employees, he announced: A batch of wasteful, gambling, fighting, and low-yield film crews and individuals will be given administrative penalties or fined. This is the first action taken by Wu Tianming since he resumed his position as director to rectify filming discipline.

	In the film "God Dragon Special Effects Team," a cinematographer used public funds to make over 10 private long-distance calls during filming, with one call costing 396 yuan. The crew had arranged meals, but he privately ate out and claimed 500 yuan. The studio decided to suspend him from duty and fine him 1,246 yuan. He was also fined 1,000 yuan for participating in gambling within the studio. The crew privately sold beverages and ran an actor training class, earning over 14,000 yuan, which was all turned over to the public.

	The director and production manager of "Chang Island Fangzi" had personal conflicts and both left the crew without authorization, causing economic losses. Both were fined 500 yuan each; a clapperboard operator injured a taxi driver and was given a major demerit, with medical expenses of over 5,700 yuan to be borne by the individual.

	The director and production manager of "The Grave Robbers of East Mausoleum" were also fined for a gambling incident within the crew. Meanwhile, Zhang Zien, Teng Wenji, Huang Jianxin, and Xu Shanshan, directors of "God Phoenix and Dragon," "The Chess King," "Misplacement," and "Blind Flow," respectively, had 9 films that incurred economic losses and failed contracts, and were fined between 370 and 8,300 yuan.

	Those who make mistakes are punished, and those who perform well are rewarded. On the same day, a batch of films, directors, screenwriters, and cinematographers that won major domestic and international awards and the studio's second "Bronze Chariot and Horse Award" last year, as well as films that achieved significant economic benefits, were commended. The 5-part serial film "The Grave Robbers of East Mausoleum" had good economic benefits, and the crew received a reward of 65,000 yuan. Zhang Zien's "God Phoenix and Dragon" crew lost money and was fined 2,260 yuan, but his film "God Whip" had good benefits and was rewarded with 11,500 yuan. Zhang Zien himself was awarded the "Bronze Chariot and Horse Award" for outstanding director and also received a reward of 500 yuan.

　　有功者奖　有过者罚
    西影厂铁面无情整顿拍片秩序
    新华社西安３月２日电  （记者卜云彤）自由散漫的作风在艺术界似乎已是见怪不怪了。但西安电影制片厂厂长吴天明并没有把这些简单地看成艺术家的潇洒、浪漫。３月１日，他在全厂职工大会上宣布：对一批挥霍浪费、赌博斗殴及效益差的摄制组和个人给予行政处分或经济罚款。这是新年伊始吴天明连任厂长后整顿拍片秩序采取的第一个行动。
    影片《神龙特技队》一个摄影师在拍片期间用公费打私人长途电话１０多次，有一次花费高达３９６元；摄制组安排有伙食，但他却私自在外边吃饭报销５００多元。厂部决定令他停职检查，并罚款１２４６元。他在厂内参加赌博另罚１０００元。这个摄制组私自倒卖饮料，办演员训练班，收入１４０００多元也全部归公。
    《川岛芳子》导演与制片主任闹个人矛盾，分别擅离摄制组，造成经济损失，两人分别罚款５００元；场记打伤出租司机，记行政大过，药费５７００多元由个人负担。
    《东陵大盗》摄制组导演、制片主任因组里发生赌博事件也被罚款。同时，张子恩、滕文骥、黄建新、许还山等人导演的《神凤威龙》、《棋王》、《错位》、《盲流》等９部影片因经济亏损，承包失败，分别被处以３７０至８３００元的罚款。
    有过者罚，有功者奖。同一天，一批在去年获得国内外大奖和本厂第二届“铜车马奖”的优秀影片、编导、摄影等和获得较大经济效益的影片受到嘉奖。５集连续电影《东陵大盗》经济效益好，摄制组得到６５０００元奖励。张子恩的《神凤威龙》摄制组亏本被罚２２６０元，但他拍的《神鞭》效益较好，又被奖励１１５００元，张子恩本人被评为“铜车马奖”优秀导演，也获得５００元奖金。
