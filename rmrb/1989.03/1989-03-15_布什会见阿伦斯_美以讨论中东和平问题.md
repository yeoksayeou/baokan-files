Our reporter, Zhang Qixun, reports from Washington, March 13th: President Bush met with Israeli Foreign Minister Arens today at the White House. During their 30-minute discussion, they focused on how to end the violence between Israeli troops and Palestinians in the occupied territories.

It is reported that President Bush has proposed "new ideas" for Middle East peace. A White House statement said that Bush hopes not to miss the opportunity for peace and hopes that Israeli Prime Minister Shamir will bring "new ideas" during his visit to the U.S. next month.

Arens arrived in Washington today. Before meeting with Bush, he held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Baker. Baker told reporters after the meeting that effective, reciprocal steps must be taken to ease tensions in the occupied territories and create a good atmosphere for peace talks. These steps include the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Palestinian gathering areas, the release of detained Palestinians, and the reopening of schools. Arens said Israel will try to ease the situation, but he reaffirmed Israel's stance of not negotiating with the PLO. He said that even though there have been changes in the Middle East in recent months, the Shamir government is not willing to back down from its original position.

This is the first high-level meeting between the U.S. and Israel since Bush took office, indicating that the U.S. government is beginning to take action on Middle East peace, gradually building trust between the conflicting parties and laying the foundation for peace talks.

　　布什会见阿伦斯
    美以讨论中东和平问题
    本报华盛顿３月１３日电  记者张启昕报道：布什总统今天在白宫会见以色列外长阿伦斯，双方在３０分钟的交谈中，集中讨论如何结束在被占领区发生的以色列军队与巴勒斯坦人之间的暴力冲突。
    据称，布什总统对中东和平提出了“新的思想”，白宫的声明说，布什希望不要丧失和平的时机并希望以色列总理沙米尔下月访美时带来“新的思想”。
    阿伦斯是今天抵达华盛顿的。在同布什会见以前，他曾同美国国务卿贝克举行了会谈。贝克在会谈后对记者说，必须采取一些有力的、互有往来的步骤，缓解被占领区的紧张局势，以便为和谈创造一种良好的气氛。据称，这些步骤包括以军撤离巴勒斯坦人的集聚区、释放被逮捕的巴勒斯坦人，让学校重新开学等。阿伦斯表示以色列将设法缓和局势，但他重申以色列决不同巴解组织进行谈判的立场。他说，即使近几个月来中东地区发生了变化，沙米尔政府也不愿从原来的立场退让。
    这是布什执政以来美以之间的第一次高级会谈，表明美国政府开始采取中东和平行动，以使冲突双方逐步建立信任，为和平谈判奠定基础。
