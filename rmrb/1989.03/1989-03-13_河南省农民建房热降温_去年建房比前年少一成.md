The per capita housing area for farmers in Henan Province has reached 16.95 square meters, essentially achieving the goal set by the State Planning Commission of 17 square meters per person by the year 2000. According to a recent survey of 4,200 rural households, the number of households building new homes in 1988 decreased by 10.58% compared to the previous year.

It is understood that the main reasons for the cooling trend in farmers' house building are:

- In the past few years, with the significant increase in farmers' income, housing expenditure for rural households has consistently been the highest among all living expenses. As a result, the living conditions and quality of rural housing have greatly improved.

- The implementation of the Land Management Law and the improvement of relevant systems have led to the establishment and improvement of housing management systems in various places. The practice of taxing the use of arable land for housing construction has, to some extent, controlled the pace of house building.

- The significant increase in the prices of building materials has constrained the scale of rural households' house building.

　　河南省农民建房热降温
    去年建房比前年少一成
    本报郑州３月１２日电  记者李杰报道：河南省农民人均住房面积已达１６．９５平方米，基本上实现了国家计委规划的到２０００年农村人均住房面积１７平方米的目标。据最近对该省４２００户农民家庭抽样调查表明，１９８８年新建住房的农户比上年减少１０．５８％。
    据了解，农民建房出现降温趋势的主要原因是：
    ——前几年，随着农民收入的大幅度提高，农户住房支出的增长速度一直位居各项生活消费支出的首位，农户住房的条件得到了较大改善，住房质量也大大提高。
    ——《土地管理法》的实施和有关制度的完善，各地都建立健全了农房管理制度，对建房占用耕地实行纳税，在一定程度上控制了建房速度。
    ——建材价格大幅度上涨，制约了农户建房的规模。
