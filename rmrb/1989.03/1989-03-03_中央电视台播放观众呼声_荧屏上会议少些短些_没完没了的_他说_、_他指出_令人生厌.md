CCTV Broadcasts Viewer Feedback: Fewer and Shorter Meetings on Screen, "He Said," "He Pointed Out" Are Annoying

Newspaper Xinhua Beijing March 2nd: Tonight, CCTV news anchors relayed viewer feedback regarding current meeting news through the television screen.

Some viewers' opinions were quite sharp. A staff member from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said: "In 'News Simulcast,' meeting news follows one after another. Phrases like 'he said' and 'he pointed out' go on and on. Every time this happens, my child gets impatient and says, 'You go home and say it yourself,' and then switches the channel."

A teacher from Hebei Province wrote in a letter: "Meeting reports should focus on solving actual problems and conveying new information to the audience. They shouldn't just generally report who attended and who spoke." He hopes that meeting and reception news can be made shorter and more concise, and not cover every detail.

A retired cadre from Linfen, Shanxi Province, and a viewer from Peking University also expressed a strong desire to reduce meeting news and change the reporting format.

The news anchor then expressed the views of the 'News Simulcast' program staff on the viewer feedback. She said, "The viewers' opinions are excellent and also reflect our thoughts. However, reforming 'News Simulcast' requires the efforts of television workers and the support of society. We sincerely hope that various sectors and departments will invite us to cover fewer meaningless news events in the future. We also hope that television journalists across the country can change their news concepts, bring back real news, and send real news."

    中央电视台播放观众呼声
    荧屏上会议少些短些
    没完没了的“他说”、“他指出”令人生厌
    新华社北京3月2日电  今晚，中央电视台新闻播音员通过电视屏幕，转述了观众对当前会议新闻的意见。
    一些观众的意见很尖锐。经贸部一位干部说：《新闻联播》中会议新闻一条接一条。“他说”“他指出”这样的话没完没了。每当这个时候，我的孩子就很不耐烦来一句“您回家自己说吧”，“乓”就给换台了。
    河北省一位教师在信中说：“会议报道应重在解决了什么实际问题，向观众传播些新的信息，不要总是泛泛地报道谁出席、谁讲话。”他希望会议、会见新闻编得短些，精炼些，不要面面俱到。
    山西临汾市一位离休干部、北京中国人民大学的观众也表达了减少会议新闻、改变报道形式的强烈意愿。
    播音员随后表达了电视台新闻联播节目工作人员对观众意见的看法。她说，观众的意见很好，也说出了我们的心里话。但《新闻联播》的改革，需要我们电视工作者的努力，更需要社会的支持。我们衷心希望各界、各部门今后少邀请我们参加没有意义的新闻的报道，也希望全国的电视记者能改变新闻观念，拍回真正的新闻，送来真正的新闻。
