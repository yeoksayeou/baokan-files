The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Central United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China hosted a banquet at the Beijing Hotel this evening to welcome deputies to the National People's Congress and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from Hong Kong and Macao.

Yan Mingfu, head of the Central United Front Work Department, addressed the banquet, expressing heartfelt thanks and sincere greetings to the Hong Kong and Macao friends participating in the two sessions. He hoped that the Hong Kong and Macao representatives would freely express their views on the country's major policies and various aspects of development and construction during the two sessions, and offer good suggestions and opinions to help improve the country's affairs.

Hab Zibin, Zhu Xuefan, Rong Yiren, Fei Xiaotong, Wang Renzhong, Fang Yi, Gu Mu, Yang Jingren, Wang Guangying, Liu Jingji, and Cheng Siyuan attended the banquet.

After the banquet, Yan Mingfu answered questions from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan reporters. He said that the matter of democratic parties and non-party personnel in China taking up high-level state positions is currently being broadly discussed among various democratic parties and various people. A reporter asked if there were any candidates for the position of vice premier among them. Yan Mingfu replied that it was possible that someone would take on a position higher than vice premier. However, he said that this involved many aspects such as organizational laws, and it would take some time, making it impossible to discuss this matter at this session of the National People's Congress.

    中共中央统战部长阎明复在宴会上致词，向参加两会的港澳朋友表示衷心感谢和诚挚问候。他希望港澳代表在两会期间，能够就国家大政方针和各方面的发展、建设畅所欲言，提出好的建议和意见，把我们国家的事情办得更好。

    宴会后，阎明复在回答港澳台记者的问题时说，中国的民主党派和无党派人士出任国家高级职务一事正在各民主党派、各方面人士中进行广泛的酝酿。有记者问，他们当中有没有副总理级人选。阎明复回答说，可能有人将担任超过副总理级的职务。但是他说，这涉及组织法等许多方面的问题，需要一些时日，来不及在这次人代会上讨论。
