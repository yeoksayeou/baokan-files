	Venezuela's Situation Basically Calm
	Government Decides to Lift Curfew in Two Provinces and Continue Austerity Economic Policies

	Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, March 3

	Given that the situation in the Venezuelan provinces of Sucre and Bolivar has returned to normal, the government decided on March 3 to lift the curfew in these two provinces.

	At the same time, the Venezuelan government also decided to reduce the curfew time in the remaining provinces nationwide by 3 hours starting from March 3.

	On February 27, many important cities across Venezuela saw bloody riots against the government's austerity economic policies, resulting in hundreds of deaths and over 300 injuries.

	To control the situation, the government declared a state of emergency nationwide and imposed a curfew on February 28.

	After the government took measures, the situation in most parts of the country quickly stabilized, and order was restored.

	Currently, 144 gas stations, 80% of supermarkets, 70% of convenience stores, 35% of food stores, and 56 supermarkets that escaped damage in the capital region have all resumed operations. Public transportation in major cities has also basically returned to normal.

	The Venezuelan government stated that although riots occurred nationwide, the government will continue to implement the established austerity economic policies.

	On March 3, although there were still military patrols in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas, some shops had already resumed business. According to reports, at least 300 people died and economic losses amounted to several million dollars in the recent days of unrest in Venezuela.
