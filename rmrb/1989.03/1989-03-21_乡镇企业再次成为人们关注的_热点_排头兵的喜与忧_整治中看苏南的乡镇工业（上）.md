Rural Enterprises Become a Hot Topic Again
The Joys and Sorrows of the Vanguard
—Observing the Rural Industry in Suzhou During Rectification (Part 1)

Over the past three years, I have visited Suzhou twice, both times during periods of national macro-control and bank credit tightening. Each visit brought different impressions; the first time, the reports of success were genuine, but the worries seemed exaggerated. This time, both the successes and worries are real, and the sense of crisis seems even stronger.

A Set of Incongruous Scenes

Scene 1: In Beishan Township, Wuxi County, a newly built leather factory. Most of the new equipment is idle, and only a few small piles of cowhide are spread out in the raw hide workshop. The factory director shows me the newly dyed colorful leather, saying, "It's a popular item, in high demand, and raw materials are easy to obtain. The only problem is a lack of funds. We have to operate at half capacity."

Scene 2: In Dongshan Township, Wuxi County, the exterior of the Jincheng Cable Factory is quite impressive. In the 4,800-square-meter workshop, only about 20 people are working. Last year, the soaring prices of copper and aluminum forced them to halt production. A kilometer of cable sells for over 110,000 yuan, but the 6 tons of copper needed to produce this cable costs 140,000 yuan. They had to stop the large machines and switch to producing small household wires, using a sledgehammer to kill a fly.

Scene 3: Three years ago, I visited a glass factory that was just starting trial production. Now, it has split into four separate entities, each seeking its own path. Some workers are installing a latex glove production line, while another production line, already installed in the same workshop, lies idle. "Since we can't even keep one line running, why install a second one?" the reporter wondered, but no one answered.

Scene 4: She leads the innovation plastic factory, producing packaging bottles for several daily chemical factories in Shanghai. The products are in high demand and have a good reputation. However, in the latter half of last year, "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer," and the trading units delayed payments, pushing them into a desperate situation of robbing Peter to pay Paul.

Perhaps these are scenes that shouldn't be put together, but they do reflect one aspect of the current state of rural industry in Suzhou.

A Few Optimistic Voices

Suzhou is not entirely shrouded in gloom; there are also many optimists.

The soaring copper prices have driven many factories to the brink. However, Zhang Liangui, the deputy director of the Antenna Factory in Nanqiao Village, Wuxi County, openly told the reporter, "From our factory's perspective, I actually hope the price goes up a bit more. Others can't take it, but we can produce more." In reality, the rise in copper prices initially had a significant impact on their factory, which relies entirely on copper. With no other options, they reduced non-production personnel and strictly controlled raw material consumption through a responsibility system. As a result, production costs dropped by nearly 50%!

On the train back to Beijing, I coincidentally met Zhao Maomei, who was in Beijing for a meeting. She is the deputy general manager of Huaxi Village Agricultural-Industrial-Commercial Combined Enterprises in Jiangyin City. "How has life been after strengthening macro-control?" I asked. To my surprise, she replied firmly, "Let them control as they wish, I am not afraid!" Her confident tone comes from her substantial financial resources. Last year, this small village of Huaxi achieved "three ones": one billion yuan in output value, 100 million yuan in taxes and profits, and 100 million yuan in foreign trade procurement. Currently, the village has over 400 million yuan in fixed assets and 400 million yuan in working capital. Not only do they have no loans, but they have also invested several million yuan externally.

The Authorities' Assessment Remains: Significant Achievements, Many Difficulties

It is undeniable that in 1988, the rural industries in Suzhou and Wuxi continued to develop impressively. In addition to maintaining over 30% growth in output value, sales revenue growth has also caught up and surpassed the growth rate of output value. Profits have reversed the downward trend of the previous two years, showing a significant increase. Tax revenues have also increased in tandem, with both exceeding 25%. The provision of agricultural development funds is around 100 million yuan each, far exceeding the same-period national investment in agriculture.

Under the impetus of the coastal economic development strategy, the export-oriented economy has made significant strides. The foreign trade procurement value of rural industries in Wuxi increased by over 40% compared to the previous year, while Suzhou saw a 70% increase. "Three types of enterprises" (foreign-funded, jointly-funded, and cooperatively-funded) in Suzhou increased from 11 at the beginning of the year to 77 by the end of the year.

The authorities in both cities are frank about the difficulties they face:

First, there is a severe shortage of funds, with some enterprises on the verge of collapse. Last year, the self-owned portion of the allocated working capital for rural enterprises in Suzhou accounted for only 5%; the slightly better situation in Wuxi was just over 10%. This round of bank credit tightening is like removing the bottom of the pot.

Second, the soaring prices of raw materials have severely affected rural industries. After the rectification and rectification, new contradictions have emerged. Originally, high prices meant there were places to buy; now, with many materials under monopoly, rural enterprises that rely on the market to find supplies are at a loss as to where to go for help!

Third, the energy gap has widened. Over the past three years, to alleviate the power shortage, many townships in Suzhou have raised funds to build small power plants. Since last year, the soaring coal prices and coal shortages have caused these "newborns" to be on the verge of collapse, and the power gap has reopened.

From the perspective of the mayor: Rural industries, which account for about two-thirds of the city's industrial output value, have problems, which means the entire economy is sliding.

From the perspective of urban enterprises: Most have established joint venture and supporting relationships with thousands of rural enterprises. If the lower levels catch a cold, the upper levels will cough.

For rural areas, rural industries are the lifeline. In recent years, all undertakings have been based on the material foundation created by rural industries. Without saying more, the loss of over 100 million yuan in agricultural development funds provided by rural industries each year would make it impossible to stabilize agriculture.

A Bit of Analysis

Xi Yepin, the director of Zhangjiagang Vibration Rubber Factory and vice-chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Rural Enterprises Association, shared with the reporter an analysis of the situation by the association: "In the process of rectification and rectification, at least 30% will be eliminated, 30% will undergo significant adjustments, and the remaining 30% will be able to overcome difficulties and develop smoothly."

In reality, enterprises that are doing well or relatively well generally have product advantages, not only are they popular in the market but also have low energy and material consumption, belonging to the "small, light, thin" type; they have relatively strong economic strength, basically relying on self-owned funds for operation, and the bank's tightening of credit has little impact on them. They have formed relatively stable joint ventures with some large urban enterprises and can resist the waves by leveraging the group's advantages.

However, enterprises with high energy and material consumption, producing "stupid, big, and rough" products or long-term products, enterprises that completely rely on bank "blood transfusions" to survive, and lone-wolf enterprises have all fallen into difficulties after the tightening.

In the environment of rectification and rectification, the direction in which rural enterprises should adjust and the type of enterprises they should align with is quite clear. However, the actual implementation is not so simple. Thousands of factories scattered across the countryside, each factory often supporting an entire village's livelihood, and the part borrowed from the bank also needs to be repaid with interest. Returning to the narrow fields of less than one mu per person? Both emotionally and practically, it is not feasible.

The adjustment of rural enterprises cannot adopt the methods of state-owned enterprises. In Suzhou, all the factory directors I met, whether they were doing well or struggling, have expressed similar sentiments: Every year is difficult, but every year we get through it. Relying on our flexible mechanisms and hardworking spirit, and the strength we have accumulated, we will definitely get through the difficulties.

　　乡镇企业再次成为人们关注的“热点”        
    排头兵的喜与忧 
    ——整治中看苏南的乡镇工业（上）
    本报记者  吴长生
    ３年两次到苏南都遇上国家加强宏观控制，银行压缩信贷规模，但每次感受不同，前次报喜实、报忧虚，这次则是二者俱实，而且危机感似乎更强烈一些。
    　　　　一组本不该拼到一起的镜头
    镜头一：吴江县北厍乡，一家新建的皮革厂。新设备大多停着，原皮车间，只在西头摊着几小堆牛皮。厂长请我看刚刚整烫出来的彩色皮革，说：“俏货，抢手得很，原料也不难弄，就缺资金。只好半开半停。”
    镜头二：无锡县东?镇，外观颇有气派的金城电缆厂。４８００平方米的大车间里，大约只有２０来人在干活，去年，翻着跟头涨价的铜和铝把他们压“趴”下了。１公里电缆才卖１１万多元，而生产这段电缆的６吨多铜却要１４万元。他们只好停下大机器，转产利高些的小型民用线，牛刀宰鸡。
    镜头三：３年前，我访问过的一家玻璃厂，那时刚刚试产，如今却已一分为四，各寻生路了。一些工人正在安装乳胶手套生产线，而就在同一车间里的另一条早已装好的生产线却静静地“睡”着。“既然一条线都保不住，还安装第二条干什么呢？”记者纳闷儿，可无人作答。
    镜头四：她领导的创新塑料厂，为上海几家日化厂生产包装瓶，产品销路好，声誉很不错。可去年下半年，“城门失火，殃及池鱼”，经销单位拖欠货款，使他们陷入拆东墙补西墙的窘境。
    也许，这是一组不该拼到一起的镜头，但它们却展示苏南乡镇工业现状的一个方面。
    　　　　几位顺风顺水者的“高论”
    苏南并非愁云密布，也有不少乐天派。
    铜价暴涨，逼得许多厂家走投无路。无锡县南桥村天线厂副厂长张良魁却毫不掩饰地对记者说：“单从我们厂角度讲，我倒希望它再涨一段时间。别人受不了，我正好多做。”其实，铜材涨价，开始对他们这个全要“吃”铜的厂冲击也蛮大。没别的法子，他们就下狠心压非生产人员，用责任制狠卡原材料消耗。结果，产品成本竟下降了近５０％！
    在回京的火车上，巧遇进京开会的赵毛妹，她是江阴市华西村农工商联合企业的副总经理。“加强宏观控制以后，日子怎样？”没想到她竟硬硬气气地回答：“随他怎么控，我不怕！”说话“气粗”，是因她的确“财大”。去年，这个小小的华西村实现了“三个一”：一亿元产值、１０００万元利税、１０００万元外贸收购额。眼下全村有４０００多万元固定资产，还有４０００多万元流动资金，不光没贷款，还向外投资了几百万。
    　　　　主管部门的估计依旧：成绩不小，困难不少
    不可否认，１９８８年，苏州、无锡两市乡镇工业的新发展的确依然引人瞩目。除产值继续保持３０％以上的增长而外，销售收入的增长也大步赶了上来，并超过产值的增长速度。实现利润则扭转了１９８６、１９８７连续两年下降的趋势，有了明显回升。上缴税金同步增加，幅度均在２５％以上。提供建农基金都在１亿元左右，大大超过同期国家的农业投资。
    在沿海经济发展战略的催动下，外向型经济长足发展。乡镇工业外贸收购额，无锡比上年增长４０％多，苏州增长了７０％。“三资”企业，年初苏州只有１１家，年末已变为７７家。
    两市的主管部门对面临的困难也毫不隐讳：
    一是资金紧，紧得一批企业临近“断炊”。去年，苏州乡镇企业定额流动资金中的自有部分只占５％；稍好些的无锡也只占１０％多一点。此次银行压缩信贷，无异于釜底抽薪。
    二是原材料价格暴涨，乡镇工业受害非浅。实行整顿、治理以后，又出了新矛盾。原来价高，还有处可买；如今众多物资实行专营，一向依靠市场找米的乡镇企业，竟不知该到哪个门去“化缘”了！
    三是能源缺口加大。近３年，为了缓和电力不足的矛盾，苏南不少乡镇自筹资金办起了小电厂。去年以来，煤价暴涨和煤源不足，致使这批“新生儿”奄奄待毙，电力缺口重新拉开。
    从市长角度看：已占到全市工业产值２／３左右的乡镇工业出问题，就意味着整个经济滑坡。
    从城里企业看：多数已与数以千计的乡间企业建立了联营配套关系，下面“伤风”，上面就“咳嗽”。
    对农村，乡镇工业更是命根子。近几年兴办的一切事业，基本都是建立在乡镇工业创造的物质基础上的。别的不说，每年失去乡镇工业提供的上亿元建农基金，农业根本就稳不住。
    　　　　仅是一点分析
    张家港市振业橡胶厂厂长奚也频，是江苏省乡镇企业家协会的副会长，他对记者介绍了最近协会对形势作的一点分析：“在整顿、治理中，至少有３０％要被淘汰，３０％要实行较大调整，另外３０％能克服困难顺利发展。”
    从实际看，好过、比较好过的企业，一般都占有产品优势，不光在市场上好销，而且能耗低、物耗少，属于“小、轻、薄”类型；具有较雄厚的经济实力，基本靠自有资金运转，银行紧抽银根对它影响不大，与一些城市大企业结成较牢固的联营对子，在风浪面前可以借助群体的优势进行抵抗。
    而那些高能耗、高物耗，生产“傻、大、粗”产品或长线产品的企业，那些完全靠银行“输血”度日的企业，那些单打独闯的企业，在紧缩后，大多陷入了困境。
    在整顿、治理的大环境中，乡镇企业该向什么方向调整，该向哪类企业靠拢，讲道理是很明了的。但具体实行，并不那么简单。分散在农村的成千上万家厂子，一个厂，往往连着一村人的饭碗，向银行借的那部分也是要还本付息的。重新回到那人均不足一亩的狭小耕地上去？从感情到实践都行不通。
    乡镇企业的调整，采取国营企业的办法是不行的。在苏南，我接触的所有厂长，不管日子好过的还是日子难过的，都讲过这类意思的话：年年难过，年年过。凭着我们灵活的机制和吃苦耐劳的劲头，凭着我们已经积累的实力，难关总会过去的。
