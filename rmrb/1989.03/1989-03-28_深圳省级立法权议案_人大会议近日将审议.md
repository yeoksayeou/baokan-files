The second session of the Seventh National People's Congress will soon review a bill to authorize the Shenzhen Municipal People's Congress and its Standing Committee to formulate local regulations for the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. If this bill is passed, Shenzhen will become the first city in China to have provincial-level legislative authority.

Recently, the reporter interviewed Shenzhen Mayor Li Huo. He told the reporter that Shenzhen is China's earliest economic special zone and also a reform experimental area. After eight years of exploration, Shenzhen has found a path, and the current situation urgently requires the establishment of a legal system that operates according to international practices. Now the conditions are basically in place. He said that reform must be coordinated with legal construction; otherwise, reform will lack legal protection. Therefore, this bill is a big deal for Shenzhen.

Mayor Li Huo revealed to the reporter the legislative plan for Shenzhen if the bill is passed. He said that the municipal people's congress, which has been prepared for several years, will be elected and formed within this year; over the next two years, more than a hundred main regulations will be formulated, and within four to five years, several hundred related implementation details and supplementary regulations will be completed. Currently, the drafting of 15 main regulations, including the "Shenzhen Municipal Administrative Supervision Regulations," "Commodity Purchase and Sale Regulations," and "Investment Protection Regulations," has been completed.

He said that in the legislative process, Shenzhen will systematically borrow and refer to the laws of Hong Kong and foreign countries, not only in economic aspects but also in related administrative management regulations.

The passage of this bill will enable Shenzhen to be the first to establish a new commercial economic order that operates according to international practices and will explore experiences for establishing such a new order nationwide.

　　深圳省级立法权议案        
    人大会议近日将审议
    本报北京３月２７日讯  记者王行增报道：七届人大二次会议近日将审议授权深圳市人大及常委会制定深圳特区法规的议案。此议案如若通过，深圳市将成为我国第一个拥有省级立法权的市。
    日前，记者采访了深圳市市长李灏。他向记者介绍说，深圳是中国最早的经济特区，也是中国改革试验区，经过８年摸索，深圳已走出了一条道路，目前的形势迫切要求建立按国际惯例办事的法律体系，现在条件已经基本具备。他说，改革必须和法律建设协调进行，否则改革就没有法律保障。因此，这项议案对深圳来说是一件大事。
    李灏市长向记者透露了议案如通过后深圳市的立法规划。他说，筹备数年的市人大将在年内选举产生；今明两年内制定上百项主条例法规，四五年内完成数百个各类相关配套的实施细则等附属条例。目前，包括“深圳市行政监察条例”、“商品买卖条例”、“投资保护条例”等在内的１５个主条例的起草已经完成。
    他说，深圳在立法过程中，将比较系统地借鉴和参考香港和外国的法律，除经济方面的以外，还有相关的行政管理方面法规。
    这项议案的通过，将使深圳率先建立起按国际惯例办事的商品经济新秩序，并将为全国范围内建立这种新秩序探索经验。
