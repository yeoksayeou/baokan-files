The "Three Elders" Sports Association was established in Beijing today after a long period of preparation. Li Menghua, Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, was the first to pay the 10 yuan membership fee, becoming a member of the association. The "Three Elders" Sports Association aims to connect retired coaches, athletes, and sports workers scattered across the country, providing them with a platform to contribute to the development of sports.

Ma Yumin, an outstanding athlete from the 1950s known for her enthusiasm and dedication, was elected as the president of the "Three Elders" Sports Association. She expressed that for a long time, many retired coaches and athletes had difficulty finding their place and opportunities to contribute. She hoped that this organization would care for them, and now this family has been established. The association will regularly organize activities, including sports consultations and academic exchanges, becoming a significant force in the development of sports.
