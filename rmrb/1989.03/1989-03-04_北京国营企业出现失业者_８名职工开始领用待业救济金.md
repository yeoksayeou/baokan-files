Beijing's first batch of unemployed workers in state-owned enterprises begin receiving unemployment benefits

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3 (Correspondent Zhu Lunxin, Reporter Liu Puquan): Eight employees from Beijing Micro Motor Factory have recently terminated their labor contracts with the enterprise and returned to society as unemployed. According to the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau, they are the first batch of unemployed workers in Beijing's state-owned enterprises.

Beijing Micro Motor Factory is the first medium-sized industrial enterprise in Beijing to implement a full-employee labor contract system. In January of this year, 49 employees who voluntarily signed labor contracts with the enterprise had their contracts expire. Three of them renewed their long-term labor contracts with the enterprise, while the remaining 46 expressed their unwillingness to renew. Among them, 38 were transferred out of the enterprise when their labor contracts expired, and 8 returned to society as unemployed.

It is understood that among these 8 unemployed individuals, there are 2 cadres and 6 workers, with most of them under the age of 30. After leaving their original enterprise, 7 of them deposited their personal files in the municipal and district-level talent exchange centers and labor markets; the other employee transferred their file to the street office where their household registration is located and completed the unemployment registration procedures, beginning to receive unemployment benefits as stipulated in the State Council's "Provisional Regulations on Unemployment Insurance for Employees of State-Owned Enterprises."

A responsible person from the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau pointed out that employees transitioning from internal unemployment to social unemployment is a major breakthrough in labor system reform. It sets a precedent for breaking the fixed-worker system that has been in place for over 30 years, achieving a two-way selection between enterprises and employees, and establishing a new type of employment system that allows for entry and exit, relative stability, and reasonable mobility.

　　北京国营企业出现失业者
    ８名职工开始领用待业救济金
    据新华社北京３月３日电  （通讯员朱伦信、记者刘浦泉）北京市微电机总厂的８名职工，最近终止了同企业签订的劳动合同，回到社会待业。据北京市劳动局今天向记者透露，他们是北京国营企业的首批失业者。
    北京微电机总厂是北京市第一家实行全员劳动合同制的中型工业企业。今年１月，这个厂４９名自愿与企业签订劳动合同书的职工在合同到期后，有３人与企业续签了长期劳动合同，其余４６人表示不愿续订合同。其中，３８人在劳动合同终止时调出企业，８人回到社会待业。
    据了解，这８名待业人员中，有干部２名、工人６名，年龄大都在３０岁以下。他们离开原来的企业后，有７人将本人档案寄存在市、区两级人才交流中心和劳务市场；另１名职工将自己的档案转入本人户口所在的街道办事处，并办理了待业登记手续，开始享受国务院关于《国营企业职工待业保险暂行规定》的待业救济金。
    北京市劳动局负责人指出，职工由企业内部待业转入社会待业，是劳动制度改革的一大突破。它为打破沿袭３０多年的固定工制度，实现企业与职工的双向选择，建立一种能进能出、相对稳定、合理流动的新型用工制度开创了先例。
