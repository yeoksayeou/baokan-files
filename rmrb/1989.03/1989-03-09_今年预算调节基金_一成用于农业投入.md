This year's budget adjustment fund, newly levied by the state, will have 10% of the amount allocated to both the central and local governments used for agricultural investment, according to Vice Minister of Finance Chi Haibin. This decision was made by the State Council to support and strengthen agriculture. Additionally, 301 impoverished counties will be exempt from the state budget adjustment fund. Apart from the projects specified in the "Collection Method" by the State Council that can be exempted from the state budget adjustment fund, new vegetable land development funds and genuine welfare enterprises for the disabled managed by the Ministry of Civil Affairs will also be exempted.

Chi Haibin emphasized that all regions, departments, and units must comply with the "Collection Method" regulations and promptly and fully remit the funds. No department or individual is allowed to arbitrarily grant exemptions. In cases of natural disasters or unexpected accidents requiring exemption from the state budget adjustment fund, the exemption authority lies with the provincial financial departments, but it must be strictly controlled. For other cases with genuine difficulties requiring exemption, approval from the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation is necessary. Units with annual incomes below 5,000 yuan and individual business households with incomes below 2,000 yuan can have minor exemptions, which must be approved by the provincial tax departments.

　　今年预算调节基金
    一成用于农业投入
    本报北京３月８日讯  财政部副部长迟海滨今天在全国征集预算调节基金工作会议上说，为了支持和加强农业，国务院决定今年新开征的国家预算调节基金，按中央和地方各自分得额的１０％用于农业投入。对３０１个贫困县免征国家预算调节基金。除国务院“征集办法”规定可以免征国家预算调节基金的项目之外，新菜地开发基金及由民政部门办的真正的残疾人福利企业，也将免征。
    迟海滨指出，各地区、各部门、各单位都必须按照“征集办法”的规定，及时足额交纳。任何部门和个人都不能乱开减免口子。遇到自然灾害和意外事故需减免国家预算调节基金，减免权限在省财政部门，但必须从严掌握。其他确有困难需减免的，必须报请财政部和国家税务局批准。年收入在５０００元以下的单位、２０００元以下的个体工商户的少额减免，须经省税务部门批准。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（王锦鹄　李琦）
