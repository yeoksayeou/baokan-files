The drug problem is a serious social issue in the capitalist world today. In the relationship between the United States and some Latin American countries, it has now become a new point of friction.

In the United States, drug abuse has long been rampant. Just last year, 23 million Americans used drugs, and the illegal drug trade amounted to nearly $100 billion. The U.S. drug problem has even alarmed the White House. In his inaugural address, President Bush loudly proclaimed, "The most obvious problem now is drug abuse," because the deadly "germ" of cocaine has caused "serious damage" to the American body.

All the cocaine used by Americans comes from the "Golden Triangle" of Peru, Colombia, and Bolivia, while Mexico's marijuana and heroin account for about 40% of the U.S. market supply. For this reason, the U.S. authorities have made this region a priority for anti-drug efforts, accusing their southern neighbors of failing to combat drugs, allowing them to flow into the United States. Latin American countries, however, believe that such accusations are unfair, blaming the United States for its own lax drug enforcement, which has also caused them harm.

Objectively speaking, it is unfair for the United States to place the primary responsibility for drug abuse on Latin American countries. Drug abuse is a pathological phenomenon in capitalist society. The United States has had a drug problem for decades, and the anti-drug war has been waged countless times, but it has been ineffective, and the situation is getting worse. It is precisely because the United States has a vast drug market that some people take the risk of producing and selling drugs. Only by resolutely curbing the demand for drugs can the production of drugs be effectively reduced. The best strategy for the United States to fight drug abuse is to first get its own house in order regarding domestic drug enforcement.

It should be said that some Latin American drug-producing countries are severely affected by drugs and have made great efforts to combat them, achieving some success. However, drug abuse, trafficking, and eradication are not only social issues but also economic ones. Latin American countries have weak economic strength and financial difficulties, making it hard for them to eradicate drug harm. The high profits from producing and trafficking drugs attract many people. This not only affects the normal agricultural production of Latin American countries but also causes a large influx of "drug dollars," seriously disrupting their economic life. It seems that drugs are a scourge for both producing and consuming countries, and the situation is worsening. Eradicating the "drug germ" should be a shared responsibility of the United States and Latin American countries, requiring joint efforts from both sides.

It is noted that since President Bush took office, he has made "fighting the drug war on all fronts" a national policy and proposed various specific measures to combat drugs. Some U.S. political figures have even suggested that the United States invest some funds in rural areas of Latin America to create new job opportunities, allowing former drug-producing farmers to leave drug production. Although this idea is well-intentioned, it is somewhat naive. It should be recognized that drug abuse is not limited to the United States and Latin American countries but has become a global issue. Due to the huge profits brought by drugs, some drug trafficking organizations have become international groups. They use various illegal means, even aircraft, cannons, and warships, to engage in armed drug trafficking, acting extremely rampantly. Destroying these "drug kingdoms" is no easy task. The U.S. drug problem has become a chronic disease that is difficult to cure. To eradicate this "germ" rooted in the corrupt capitalist system and to awaken thousands of cocaine and heroin addicts to the right path is not something that can be achieved overnight. Therefore, fighting drug abuse is a long-term, complex, and arduous task. As the "drug kingdom," the United States certainly has a major responsibility, but the international community also needs to strengthen cooperation, jointly eradicate drug-producing areas, cut off the channels for drug abuse, and awaken humanity's conscience to fight against drugs. Perhaps this way, some effects can be achieved.

### 扫毒是共同的任务

　　扫毒是共同的任务
    管彦忠
    毒品问题是当今资本主义世界的严重社会问题。而在美国和一些拉美国家关系中，如今更成了一个新的摩擦点。
    在美国，毒品早已泛滥成灾，仅去年美国就有２３００多万人服用毒品，毒品非法交易额近千亿美元。美国的吸毒问题更是惊动了白宫。布什总统在就职演说中大声疾呼：“现在最明显的问题是吸毒问题”，因为致命的可卡因“病菌”已对美国躯体造成“严重的损伤”。
    美国人服用的可卡因全部来自秘鲁、哥伦比亚和玻利维亚这个“白三角”，墨西哥的大麻和海洛因占美国市场供应量的四成左右。为此，美国当局把这一地区视为肃毒的重点，并指责南部邻邦扫毒不力，致使毒品源源不断运往美利坚；拉美国家认为，这种责备不公平，责怪美国自己禁毒不严，使它们也深受其害。
    平心而论，美国把毒品泛滥的主要责任推给拉美国家是欠公允的。吸毒是资本主义社会一种病态现象。美国出现吸毒问题少说也有几十年历史了，扫毒战也不知搞过多少回，但屡禁不止，且大有道高一尺，魔高一丈之势。正因为美国有广大的毒品市场，才使得一些人铤而走险，干起生产、贩卖毒品的营生。只有坚决抑制对毒品的需求，才是减少毒品生产的有效途径。美国要同吸毒作斗争，最为上策的还是先把国内禁毒的事办好。
    应该说，拉美一些毒品生产国深受毒品之害，它们也是下了大气力扫毒的，并取得了一定成绩。但吸毒贩毒和扫毒不仅是社会问题，也是一个经济问题。拉美国家经济实力薄弱，政府财政困难，清除毒害力不从心。而生产和贩卖毒品的高额利润又使许多人趋之若鹜。这不仅影响了拉美国家正常的农业生产，还使“毒品美元”大量涌入，严重冲击了这些国家的经济生活。看来，毒品对生产国和消费国都是祸害，而且愈演愈烈，铲除毒品“病菌”应当是美国和拉美国家的共同责任，需要双方作出努力。
    人们注意到，布什总统上任后，已将“在各条战线上进行反毒品战”定为国策，并提出了同毒品作斗争的各种具体措施。有的美国政界人士还建议美国拿出一部分资金在拉美农村地区投资，以创造新的就业机会，使从前靠毒品谋生的农民脱离毒品生产。这一主意虽用心良好，但稍嫌天真。应该看到，毒品泛滥不仅限于美国和拉美国家，甚至已是超越国界、洲界的全球性问题。由于毒品带来了暴利，一些贩毒组织已成为国际性集团，它们利用种种非法手段，甚至动用飞机、大炮、兵舰，武装贩毒，活动极其猖獗，要摧毁这些“贩毒王国”绝非易事。而美国的吸毒问题已成为久治不愈的痼疾，要铲除植根于资本主义腐朽制度的这一“病菌”，使千千万万沉溺于可卡因、海洛因的“瘾君子”迷途知返也非一朝一夕所能奏效。因此，同吸毒作斗争是一个长期的、复杂的、艰巨的任务。作为“吸毒王国”的美国固然有重大责任，国际社会也有必要加强合作，共同努力，摧毁毒品生产地，切断毒品泛滥通道，唤醒人类同毒品作斗争的良知，这样也许能收到一些成效。
