The People's Daily, Shijiazhuang, March 24th - Reporter Chen Guoqing reports: Hebei will use two years to reform the current rural administrative management system, strengthen grassroots organizational construction, and adapt to the needs of rural economic development and social administrative management.

For many years, the county-level administrative setup and personnel allocation in Hebei have been characterized by having more personnel and larger organizations at higher levels and fewer personnel and smaller organizations at lower levels, resulting in a "top-heavy" structure. To address this issue, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have decided to delegate more authority to the townships. County-level departments stationed in townships, except for the Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau, Taxation Bureau, and Police Stations which will be under the dual leadership of both county and township, will all be transferred to the townships. The scale of townships will be appropriately adjusted. Townships with expanded scales can establish police stations, financial bureaus, taxation bureaus, and industrial and commercial bureaus to enhance the management functions and economic strength of the townships. At the same time, while establishing and improving village committees, village offices will also be set up.

    河北改革农村行政体制
    本报石家庄３月２４日电  记者陈国琦报道：河北将用两年时间，改革现行农村行政管理体制，加强基层组织建设，以适应农村经济发展和社会行政管理的需要。
    多年来，河北各县在机构设置和人员配备上，上多下少，上大下小，头重脚轻，形成“倒金字塔”。为解决此弊端，省委、省府决定给乡镇放权。县直部门派驻乡镇的机构和人员，除工商局、税务所和派出所实行县乡镇双重领导外，其余都放到乡镇。适当调整乡镇规模。规模扩大的乡镇，可设立派出所、财政所、税务所、工商所，以加强乡镇的管理职能和经济实力。在建立健全村委会的同时，建立村公所。
