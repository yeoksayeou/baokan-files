Shanghai, the largest city in China, has built 39.85 million square meters of housing in the past 10 years. This achievement has increased Shanghai's per capita housing area from 4.3 square meters 10 years ago to the current 6.15 square meters.

At the time of Shanghai's liberation, the total housing area was 23 million square meters. The housing area added in the past 10 years is equivalent to 1.73 times the housing area at the time of liberation and 2.35 times the housing area added in the 29 years after the founding of the nation.
