A Nepali man's ignorance and superstition nearly resulted in a tragic incident.

According to a report by the Nepalese News Agency today, a man from eastern Nepal attempted to sacrifice his daughter to the gods due to his ignorance and superstition.

The 21-year-old man, Bahadur Tamang, has been suffering from a chronic illness for a long time without any improvement. In his desperation to rid himself of his ailments, he came up with the idea of sacrificing his own daughter to the gods.

Fortunately, just as he was about to slit his daughter's throat, his wife arrived and stopped the tragedy from unfolding.

Tamang has been arrested by the police, and his daughter is currently receiving treatment in a hospital.
