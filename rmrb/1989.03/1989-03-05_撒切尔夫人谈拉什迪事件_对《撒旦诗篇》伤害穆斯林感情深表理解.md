	Thatcher Discusses the Rushdie Affair
	Expresses Deep Understanding of the Hurt Feelings of Muslims Over "The Satanic Verses"

	BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) — British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher yesterday spoke in her constituency of Finchley in north London about the Rushdie affair, expressing deep understanding of the hurt feelings of Muslims over "The Satanic Verses." She said: "This is just like the behavior of a Christian that deeply wounds the feelings of people who believe in Christianity." She also pointed out that as a "religion with a wide range of believers, its firm faith is sufficient to withstand such events."

	Observers here believe that the UK and Iran are on the verge of completely severing diplomatic relations. The British government's move is aimed at appeasing Muslim anger and is the first step towards resolving the dispute with Iran.

	According to reports, Iran has responded to Thatcher's remarks. The official Tehran Radio said that Thatcher's comments on the Rushdie affair are a small step in the right direction, but they are far from enough.

　　撒切尔夫人谈拉什迪事件
    对《撒旦诗篇》伤害穆斯林感情深表理解
    本报伦敦３月４日电  记者陈特安报道：英国首相撒切尔夫人昨天在她所在选区北部伦敦芬奇里就拉什迪事件发表谈话，对《撒旦诗篇》一书“伤害了穆斯林人”的感情深表理解。她说：“这正如一个基督教徒的行为深深地刺伤了信仰基督教的人民的感情一样。”她同时指出，作为“信徒广泛的宗教，其坚定信仰足以抵挡这类事件”。
    此间观察家认为，英伊两国正处于完全断绝外交关系的边缘，英国政府此举旨在平息穆斯林的愤慨，是朝解决同伊朗纷争的方向迈出的第一步。
    据报道，伊朗已对撒切尔夫人的讲话作出反应。官方的德黑兰电台说，撒切尔夫人对拉什迪事件的评论是向正确的方向迈出的一小步，但还远远不足。
