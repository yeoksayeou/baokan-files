On the morning of February 10, I visited 10 pharmacies in Nanyang City, including those on Jikang Road, Zhongzhou Road, and Renmin Road, but I couldn't find any contraceptives. It is understood that in recent years, many pharmacies in our city have never stocked contraceptives. This situation should be of concern to relevant departments.

　　南阳市缺避孕药具
    ２月１０日上午，我跑了南阳市济康、中州路、人民路等１０家药店，但是没有买到一种避孕药具。据了解，近几年来，我市许多药店从来不储备避孕药具。这种现象应引起有关部门的重视。
