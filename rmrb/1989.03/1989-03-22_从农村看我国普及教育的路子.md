China's education has developed rapidly, but overall it remains relatively backward. This is most evident in the low level of education universalization and the fact that the average educational attainment is less than 5 years. The concern expressed by people from all walks of life about the education issue is justified. To fundamentally change this situation is not something that can be achieved overnight; it requires early planning. Among these issues, rural education is particularly important. I would like to share some of my views here to stimulate discussion.

		Fully Recognize the Strategic Position of Rural Education

In China's school education system, there are 218 million students. Among them, 214 million are receiving middle school education or below (including middle school), and 80% of these students are in rural areas. This determines that the main focus of China's universal education is in rural areas, and the difficulties also lie in rural areas. Especially in mountainous areas, pastoral areas, and some minority regions where modern education traditions are lacking, the difficulty of achieving universal education is even greater. If we do not fully consider these characteristics, we will deviate from our national conditions.

To revitalize China's economy, agriculture will be a long-term constraint. However, the reality of agricultural production is that approximately 70% of mature agricultural technologies have not been promoted and applied nationwide. The effective rate of fertilization is only 30% on average, and even simple technologies such as pruning fruit trees and preventing poultry diseases are not mastered by the majority of farmers. China still has 220 million illiterates and semi-illiterates, 92% of whom are in rural areas. County and township enterprises generally lack technical and managerial talents, and there is a lack of high-quality labor. For a long time, there has been a situation of high consumption, severe pollution, and low product quality.

From the perspective of educational reform, rural education has a more direct and obvious relationship with local construction. Compared with urban education, it relies less on the reform of systems such as labor, personnel, and wages, making educational reform easier to implement. This is somewhat similar to the economic system reform starting from rural areas.

		Rural Education Must Be Radically Reformed

Since the founding of the People's Republic, especially in the ten years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's rural education has made tremendous progress. However, due to the lack of emphasis on the relationship between education and the economy in educational guidance, rural education often follows the urban education model, resulting in a general tendency to detach from rural realities. Many counties can proudly say that they have a certain number of local students who have graduated from university and entered Beijing's Zhongguancun, the most densely populated area of intelligence in the country. However, the local landscape remains unchanged, and the poverty of the farmers has not changed much. The traditional educational idea of leaving agriculture for higher education, the objective existence of urban-rural differences, and the underdevelopment of commodity economy make these places often regard helping students to enter state-assigned colleges and universities as the best educational outcome. Most of these students who leave the countryside do not return. While primary, middle, and high school graduates who return to the countryside to participate in productive labor often lack preparation in ideology, vocational skills, and labor skills, and it takes a long time for them to adapt. What is called adaptation is often to engage in production labor according to traditional backward production technology, and the role of education has not been fully played. In the past two years, the dropout rate among junior high school students has increased, and in some provinces where the commodity economy has begun to develop, it once reached over 14%. This is not only due to the short-sighted behavior of parents and society, which needs to be restrained by legal and ideological education, but also because junior high school education itself cannot provide students with the skills and techniques to get rich, which is an important reason for the lack of attraction to students and parents. After the announcement last year that university graduates will gradually no longer be assigned jobs, this contradiction has become more prominent.

In the past 40 years, China has established a number of higher and secondary vocational schools oriented towards agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and other fields, with an annual output of more than 70,000 graduates. According to this figure, every township in the country can be allocated more than one such university or vocational school graduate each year. However, since the founding of the People's Republic, these schools have always had difficulties in enrollment and students changing their majors after graduation. Even now, 50% or even more graduates change their majors to engage in other work. On the front line of agriculture, the proportion of scientific and technical personnel is very low. A more prominent problem is that education cannot cultivate a large number of new-type agricultural laborers who have socialist consciousness, culture, technology, and management skills. This has resulted in a situation where agricultural university professors promote agricultural science and technology to illiterates and scientifically illiterate people. It is like marching towards modernization, where this army has commanders but lacks a large number of qualified soldiers armed with modern science and technology. It is also important to note that graduates from agricultural universities and most vocational schools are always paid salaries and have to go to fully state-owned units, which, under the condition of backward agricultural production, find few suitable positions in rural areas.

After the first step of rural economic system reform was completed, rural productivity has significantly improved. Rural areas urgently need scientific and technological knowledge and management skills, and rural education needs to be reformed accordingly.

		The Universalization of Rural Education Should Combine with Vocational and Technical Education

Social needs are the fundamental driving force for the development and reform of education. The development of rural social productivity drives rural education, which is not subject to human will. Under this situation, rural areas have gradually shown a trend of comprehensive educational reform. Education below the county level is mainly middle school education and below. Among the students receiving this education, only about 3% of the same-age population can enter higher education, and the vast majority will return to the countryside or stay in the county for employment. Therefore, education below the county level should mainly cultivate talents for the local area. Rural education can be roughly divided into three categories: basic education, vocational and technical education, and adult education. Adult education refers to education after school, excluding literacy education, mainly vocational and technical education. Therefore, in terms of content, rural education is only basic education and vocational and technical education. Currently, vocational and technical education and adult education in rural areas have developed to a certain extent. However, the development speed is still lower than that of cities, and the inland is lower than the coastal areas, with extremely uneven development, far from meeting the needs of rural construction.

The development of vocational and technical education has a significant effect on promoting the improvement of rural productivity and increasing farmers' income. Typical surveys have shown that farmers' income level is directly proportional to their cultural structure. Those with higher educational attainment also have higher per capita household income. Those with a certain level of education and who have learned some agricultural science and technology have much higher income than those who have not learned technology. This shows that from the perspective of cultivating qualified labor, it is not enough to only teach students cultural and scientific knowledge; vocational and technical education is also necessary.

Pingdu County in Shandong Province has developed rural basic education while basically forming a network of vocational and technical education and adult education, promoting significant growth in local agricultural and industrial production. The State Education Commission cooperated with Hebei Province to conduct comprehensive educational reform pilot projects in three counties designated by the state as poverty-stricken areas, mainly exploring a path that combines basic education with vocational and technical education. Except for a small amount of support in teacher training, the state has not given any financial preferential treatment to educational reform. Now, the rural educational reform in these three counties has achieved some experience, and it has begun to produce effects in promoting economic development. The per capita income of the three counties has increased significantly for two consecutive years, and many townships and villages have already shaken off poverty. These facts show that whether in relatively affluent areas or relatively poor areas, rural education has common laws.

		The Key is to Establish a "Mutual Promotion" Mechanism Between Education and Economic and Social Development

Implementing universal education combined with the development of vocational and technical education requires further reform of the educational system. First, the development of vocational and technical education must be combined with local economic and social development. This requires the county-level government to plan and organize the development of education, science and technology promotion, and economic development in an integrated manner, transforming education to primarily serve the local construction by cultivating primary and intermediate-level talents and improving the quality of laborers.

From the perspective of education itself, basic education should comprehensively cultivate students' qualities and continuously improve educational quality. While organizing students to systematically learn cultural courses, labor technology courses should be added in certain stages; the curriculum should be linked to local production and living conditions to appropriately increase local content; students can also choose to study some practical technical content; students' extracurricular activities can also learn some elementary practical techniques.

Vocational and technical education, in addition to vocational high schools and vocational education centers established by counties as the backbone, should currently focus on the development of vocational and technical education in the junior high school stage. The forms should be diversified. In some places, after students graduate from primary school, they can learn some simple practical techniques.

The development of vocational and technical education requires necessary conditions such as professional technical teachers and practice and experimental sites. To make full use of existing conditions, fully exert effectiveness and potential, it is necessary to change the original situation where basic education, vocational and technical education, and adult education are separate systems, and achieve the unified use of professional teachers and practice and experimental sites. The county should arrange professionals from various systems to teach in schools.

From the existing experience, such reforms in rural education will make education turn to serving the local cultivation of talents and improving the quality of laborers, which may greatly alleviate the tendency to pursue high admission rates. Education is combined with the aspirations of farmers to get rich, enhancing farmers' enthusiasm for sending their children to school. The social benefits of basic education will take a long time to show. While vocational and technical education, as long as it is targeted at the needs of local construction, can start with some "short, flat, and fast" practical technical training, economic effects can be seen in one or two years. Therefore, it is easy to attract the attention of county, township, and village-level leaders and the masses, thereby promoting the improvement of school conditions and the increase of educational funds.

China's rural areas urgently need cultural, scientific, and technological knowledge, production and management knowledge, and modern civilization information. As long as education truly turns to the track of serving local construction, rural schools have a lot to do. This will greatly stimulate the enthusiasm for running schools among the masses, forming a virtuous cycle between education and construction, "education promotes wealth, wealth promotes education." Many difficulties in education can be solved relatively smoothly. Qinglong County, Hebei Province, Caochang Village is a small village. The village invested 170,000 yuan in ten years to run a farmers' cultural and technical school, persistently carried out part-time education, popularized science and technology, and carried out legal education, not only promoting the per capita income from 50 yuan in 1978 to 700 yuan in 1987, but also eliminating phenomena such as gambling, fighting, theft, superstition, and disrespect for the elderly in the village. The cadres and masses of the village deeply felt from practice that "investment in education is the most profitable investment."

The experiment of rural education reform also provides new ideas for urban education reform, that is, gradually establishing a "mutual promotion" mechanism between education and urban economic and social development, and making the entire education system more dynamic. The reform of rural education will also guide the reform of higher education such as agriculture, normal, and medical education that serves rural construction, and seek new development mechanisms.

The main body of China's education is the universalization of various types of education below the middle school level. From rural areas, we can draw lessons: we must strive to explore the path of educational development that suits China's national conditions. As long as the right path is found, the prospects for the education cause will become brighter and brighter.

　　从农村看我国普及教育的路子
    何东昌
    我国的教育发展很快，但在总体上还较落后。这突出地表现在教育的普及水平比较低，人均受教育程度不足５年。教育问题引起各界有识之士的忧虑是有道理的。要根本改变这种状况，决非一日之功，必须及早予以筹划。这中间农村教育问题尤为重要。现在谈一点我的看法，以期引起讨论。
    　　　　充分认识农村教育的战略地位
    在我国学校教育系统中，学生人数已达２．１８亿人。其中接受中等以下（含中等）教育的学生人数为２．１４亿人，他们中有８０％在农村。这就决定了我国普及教育的大头在农村，难点也在农村。特别是在人口居住十分分散或者流动不定的山区、牧区和缺乏近代教育传统的某些少数民族地区，普及教育的难度更大。不充分考虑这些特点，就会脱离我们的国情。
    要振兴我国的经济，农业将是长期的制约因素。而农业生产面临的现实是：全国约有７０％的早已成熟的农业技术成果没有得到推广应用，施肥的有效率平均只有３０％，果树剪枝、家禽防疫这类最普通的简易技术也没有为广大农民所掌握。我国尚有２．２亿文盲、半文盲，其中９２％在农村。县乡镇企业普遍缺乏技术人才和管理人才，缺乏素质较好的劳动者，长时间存在消耗高、污染大、产品质量低的状况。
    从教育改革的角度看，农村教育与当地建设的关系比较直接和明显。与城市教育相比，对劳动、人事、工资等制度配套改革的依赖要少得多，教育改革易于着手。这与经济体制改革从农村开始有某些相似之处。
    　　　　农村教育必须大力改革
    建国以来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来的十年，我国农村教育有了巨大的发展。但由于在教育指导思想上，没有重视研究教育与经济的关系，往往习惯于用城市教育的模式去要求农村教育，致使农村教育在总体上依然存在脱离农村实际的倾向。不少县可以自豪地讲有多少本地学生大学毕业后进入全国智力最密集的北京中关村地区。但是当地山河面貌依旧，农民的贫困状态没有多少改变。为脱离农业生产而升学的传统教育思想、城乡差别的客观存在和商品经济的不发达，使这些地方往往把帮助学生升入国家包分配的大中专学校作为最好的教育结果。这部分离开农村的学生绝大多数是不返回本地的。而回乡参加生产劳动的小学、初中、高中毕业生又大都在思想上、职业技术上和劳动技能上缺乏准备，往往要经过很长时间才能适应。而所谓适应也大多是按传统的落后的生产技术从事生产劳动，没有充分发挥出教育应有的作用。近两年来初中学生中辍学流失的比率有所增长，有的商品经济开始发展的省份，一度高达１４％以上。这其中固然有家长和社会的短视行为，要用法律和思想教育的手段加以制约，但是初中教育本身不能给学生以致富的本领和技术，对学生和家长缺乏吸引力也是一个重要原因。去年公布了大学毕业生今后将逐步实行不包分配以后，这个矛盾进一步突出了。
    我国在４０年间已建设起一批面向农业的农、林、水产等高等学校和中等专业学校，每年毕业生可达７万人以上。按此数字计算，全国每个乡每年都可以分配到１名以上这样的大学或中专毕业生。但是建国以来这类学校一直存在着招生困难、学生毕业改行的问题。至今仍有５０％甚至更多的毕业生改行从事其它工作。在农业第一线，科技人员的比例很低。更突出的问题是，教育不能造就大批有社会主义觉悟的、有文化、有技术、懂经营的新型农业劳动者。以致形成了农业大学教授面向文盲、科盲推广农业科学技术的局面。这好比向现代化进军中，这支大军只有指挥员，而缺乏大批用现代科学技术武装起来的合格的战斗员。还要看到，农业高等学校和大部分中专学校的毕业生是一直拿工资的，要到全民所有制单位去，这在农村生产水平落后的条件下是找不到多少合适岗位的。
    农村经济体制改革的第一步完成以后，农村生产力有了明显提高。农村迫切需要科学技术和经营知识，急需农村教育的相应改革。
    　　　　农村教育的普及要走与职业技术教育相结合的路子
    社会需要是教育发展和改革的根本动力。农村社会生产力的发展对农村教育的推动，是不以人的意志为转移的。在这种形势下，农村逐渐出现了教育综合改革的势头。县以下的教育主要是中等以下的教育。在接受这些教育的学生中，只有３％左右的同龄人能够进入高等学校，绝大多数要回乡或留在县镇就业。因此，县以下的教育主要应该为本地区培养人才。农村教育大体可以分为三类：基础教育、职业技术教育和成人教育。成人教育是指学校后的教育，除了扫盲以外主要是职业技术教育。因此就内容来区分，农村教育只是基础教育和职业技术教育两类。现在农村职业技术教育和成人教育有了一定发展。但其发展速度仍然低于城市，内地又低于沿海，发展极不平衡，远远不能适应农村建设的需要。
    职业技术教育的发展，对于促进农村生产力的提高，增加农民收入具有明显的作用。典型调查表明，农民收入水平是与其文化结构成正比例的。受教育程度较高的，家庭人均收入也相应较高。而有了一定文化水平，又学习一些农业科学技术的，其收入比没有学习技术的要高得多。这说明，从培养合格劳动者的角度看，只教给学生文化科学知识还不够，还必须进行职业技术教育。
    山东省平度县在发展农村基础教育的同时，基本形成了职业技术教育和成人教育的网络，促使当地工农业生产明显增长。国家教委与河北省合作，在河北省三个国家确定为贫困地区的县进行教育综合改革的试点，主要是探索出一条基础教育与职业技术教育相结合的路子。对这三个县除了在培训师资方面给予少量支持外，国家对教育改革没有任何经费上的优待。现在这三个县的农村教育改革已经取得了一些经验，在促进经济发展上已开始产生作用。三个县的人均收入连续两年以较大幅度增长，不少乡、村已经脱贫。这些事实说明，不论比较富裕的地方还是相对贫困的地方，农村教育有共同的规律。
    　　　　关键是建立教育与经济社会发展的“互促”机制　
    实行普及教育与发展职业技术教育结合，需要进一步改革教育体制。首先，职业技术教育的发展，必须与当地经济和社会发展结合起来。这就需要县一级政府把经济发展、科技推广和教育发展统一加以规划，统一组织实施，把教育转向主要为当地建设培养初、中级人才和提高劳动者素质服务。
    从教育内部讲，基础教育要全面培养学生的素质，不断提高教育质量。在组织学生系统学习好文化课程的同时，要在一定阶段增加劳动技术课；在课程设置中要联系当地生产和生活实际适当增加乡土内容；学生还可以选修一些实用技术的内容；学生课外活动也可以学点初级实用技术。
    职业技术教育，除了县里举办的职业技术高中和职教中心作为骨干以外，当前大多数地方要重点发展初中阶段的职业技术教育。形式要多样化。有的地方，也可以在学生小学毕业后，学习一些简单的实用技术。
    发展职业技术教育，必须有专业技术师资、实习实验场地等必备条件。为了充分利用现有条件，充分发挥效益和潜力，应当改变基础教育、职业技术教育、成人教育原来三方面各成体系的状况，做到专业教师、实习实验场地统筹使用。县里要统一安排各系统的专业人才到学校兼课。
    从已有的经验看，农村教育这样改革，使教育转向为当地培养人才和提高劳动者素质服务，可能会大大缓解片面追求升学率的倾向。教育与农民群众的致富愿望结合起来了，增强了农民送子女上学的积极性。基础教育的社会效益要经过较长时间才能显示出来。而职业技术教育，只要针对当地建设的需要，在开始时搞一些“短平快”的实用技术培训，在一两年内就可以在经济上看到效果。因而容易引起县乡村三级领导干部和广大群众的重视，从而促进了学校办学条件的改善、教育经费的增加等。
    中国的农村迫切需要文化科学技术、生产经营知识和现代文明的信息。只要教育真正转到为当地建设服务的轨道上来，农村学校可以办的事情多得很。这将使广大群众中蕴藏着的办学积极性极大地激发出来，形成教育与建设之间互相促进的良性机制，“教促富、富促教”，教育上的许多困难都可以比较顺利地解决。河北省青龙县草场村，是个不大的村庄。全村在十年间投入１．７万元举办农民文化技术学校，常年不懈抓业余教育，普及科学技术加上开展了普法教育等，不仅促使人均收入从１９７８年的５０元上升到１９８７年的７００元，而且村里赌博、打架、偷摸、迷信和不尊敬老人的现象也消失了。村里的干部群众从实践中深深体会到“对教育的投入是效益最大的投入”。
    农村教育改革的试验，也为城市教育改革提供了新的思路，那就是逐步建立起教育与城市经济和社会发展的“互促机制”，把整个教育搞活。农村教育的改革还必将引导为农村建设服务的如农业、师范、医学等高等教育加速改革，并寻求到新的发展机制。
    中国教育的大头是普及中等以下的各类教育，从农村可以得到启示：一定要努力探索适合我国国情的教育发展途径，只要路子找对了，教育事业的前景就会越来越光明。
