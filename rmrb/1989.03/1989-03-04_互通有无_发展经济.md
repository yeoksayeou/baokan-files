International trade is an important component of the world economy. As reform and opening up deepen, the economic lives of the Chinese people are becoming increasingly connected with those of other countries and regions around the world. Foreign trade is thus becoming an increasingly important driving force for China's economic development.

Currently, the world economy is experiencing sustained growth, and the volume of international trade is continually expanding. However, at the same time, trade competition among countries is becoming increasingly fierce. In this context, we must closely monitor the development trends and market dynamics of international trade, learn from the advanced experiences of foreign countries in developing trade, and strive for new developments in China's foreign trade.

    国际贸易是世界经济的一个重要组成部分。随着改革、开放的深入进行，我国人民的经济生活同世界其他国家和地区发生着日益密切的联系，对外贸易也愈益成为我国经济发展的重要动力。
    当前，世界经济持续增长，国际贸易额不断扩大。但与此同时，各国间的贸易竞争也日益激烈。在这种形势下，我们必须密切注视国际贸易的发展趋势和市场动向，借鉴外国发展贸易的先进经验，争取我国外贸有新的发展。　编者
