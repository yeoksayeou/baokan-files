Poor Management Leads to Unquantifiable Losses for Renault

Profit of 8.9 Billion Francs in the Previous Year

	PARIS, March 23 (Xinhua) — According to today's Le Monde, the French state-owned Renault automobile company made a net profit of 8.9 billion francs last year, making it the most profitable enterprise in the French industrial sector.

	Renault is a long-established state-owned enterprise in France with over 180,000 employees. Due to poor management, it has been incurring losses for several years, with the worst year seeing a loss of 12.5 billion francs. It was not until 1987 that the company made a profit of 3.7 billion francs.

	Renault's turnaround is related to government subsidies and a favorable domestic and international automobile market. However, the main reason is the improvement in management and efficiency. The company believes that over the past five years, it has laid off 30,000 employees, and the productivity of the workers has increased, enabling the enterprise to steadily rise in the competitive market.

　　经营不善　雷诺损失难计        
    去岁扭亏　净盈法郎８９亿
    本报巴黎３月２３日电  据今天《世界报》报道，法国国营雷诺汽车公司去年获得８９亿多法郎的纯利，成为法国工业界效益最好的一家企业。
    雷诺是法国一家老牌的国营大企业，有１８多万员工。由于经营管理不善，近些年来年年亏损，最严重的一年亏损１２５亿法郎，直至１９８７年公司才获得３７亿法郎的利润。
    雷诺汽车公司的“翻身”与政府资助和国内外汽车市场看好有关，但主要原因仍是改善管理，提高效益。该公司认为，近５年间裁减３万员工，工人的生产效力得到提高，从而使企业在竞争中稳步上升。
