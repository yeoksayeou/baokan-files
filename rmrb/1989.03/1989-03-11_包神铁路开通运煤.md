The newly constructed Baogandao (Baotou to Shengmu) railway began coal transportation today. The first train, fully loaded with high-quality coal, is speeding towards the Zhangjiakou power station in Hebei Province.

The Baogandao railway, with a total investment of over 300 million yuan, starts from the Wanshuiquan station on the Baolan (Baotou to Lanzhou) line in the north and ends at the Dalitata station in Shengmu County, Shaanxi Province in the south. The railway is 172 kilometers long and is a dedicated coal transportation line for the development of the Shenfu and Dongsheng coalfields. The designed annual transportation capacity is 100 million tons. It is estimated that over 100 million tons of coal will be transported this year. The opening of the Baogandao railway for coal transportation will play an important role in alleviating the energy shortage in China.

　　包神铁路开通运煤
    本报北京３月１０日讯  新建包（头）神（木）铁路今天开通运煤。第一列满载优质煤的列车直向京津唐电网的张家口市下花园发电厂飞驰。
    总投资３亿多元的包神铁路，北起包（头）兰（州）线上的万水泉站，南至陕西省神木县的大柳塔，全长１７２公里，是开发神府、东胜煤田的一条运煤专用线。设计年运量为１０００万吨。预计今年运煤可达１００万吨以上。包神铁路开通运煤，对缓解我国能源紧张状况将起到重要作用。
