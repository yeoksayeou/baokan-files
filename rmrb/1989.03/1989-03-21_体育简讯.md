The sports management training class sponsored by the International Olympic Committee began on March 20 at the Beijing Institute of Physical Education. The trainees include over forty sports leaders from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong, and students from the sports management department of the Beijing Institute of Physical Education.

The first Asian-African Games are scheduled to be held from November 24 to December 1 this year in New Delhi, the capital of India. This decision was made at a high-level meeting held on the 19th after the Asian-African Sports Coordination Committee accepted the application from the Indian Olympic Committee.

The first Asian-African Games will include events such as football, basketball, volleyball, handball, tennis, wrestling, judo, athletics, field hockey, and weightlifting. The lion has been chosen as the mascot for this event.
