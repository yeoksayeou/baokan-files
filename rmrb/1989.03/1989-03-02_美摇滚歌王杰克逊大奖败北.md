The 31st Annual Grammy Awards, often referred to as the "Oscars of Music," were recently held at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Two black rock stars, Bobby McFerrin and Tracy Chapman, took home the top prizes. Michael Jackson, once a rock king, has seen his star fade, securing only a nomination for the Best Record of the Year, but failing to win.

Bobby McFerrin, who rose to fame in the United States last year, was a standout. His album "Don't Worry, Be Happy" won the awards for Best Record of the Year and Best Song of the Year. Additionally, his "Brothers" was named the Best Male Jazz Vocal Performance.

Competing with McFerrin was black female singer Tracy Chapman. Her album "Fast Car" won the awards for Best New Artist, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Best Female Pop Vocalist.

    美摇滚歌王杰克逊大奖败北
    有“奥斯卡音乐奖”之称的美国第三十一届格拉米音乐大奖颁奖典礼最近在洛杉矶的圣殿大会堂隆重举行，两位黑人摇滚乐歌星博比·麦克菲林和特蕾西·查普曼获得大奖。曾经红极一时的摇滚歌王迈克尔·杰克逊走了下坡路，只获得年度最佳唱片奖的提名，没有得奖。
    去年走红美国的中年黑人摇滚歌星博比·麦克菲林引人注目，他灌制的唱片《别着急，快活些》夺得最佳年度唱片奖和最佳年度歌曲奖。此外，他的《哥儿们》还被评为最佳男声爵士歌曲奖。
    同麦克菲林抗衡的是黑人女歌星特蕾西·查普曼，她的唱片《快车》夺得最佳新秀、最佳女声通俗唱法和最佳女子通俗歌手三项大奖。
