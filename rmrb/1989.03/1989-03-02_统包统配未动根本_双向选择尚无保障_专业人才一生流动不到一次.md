Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 1st.

According to the latest statistics from relevant departments, the current annual mobility rate of professional and technical personnel in China's scientific research institutions, colleges and universities, and large and medium-sized enterprises is less than 2%, and the number of times professional and technical personnel move in their lifetime is less than once.

It is understood that more than 40 provinces, municipalities, and ministries, over 250 cities, and more than 1,000 counties across the country have established talent exchange service agencies, forming a talent mobility service network from top to bottom.

According to relevant departments, in recent years, the flow of talent has shown a trend of positive and reverse crossover and diversification.

Although China's talent mobility work has made some progress in recent years, from an overall perspective, the difficulty in talent mobility remains the main trend. According to the analysis of relevant departments, the fundamental reason for the difficulty in talent mobility is that the talent management system characterized by unified allocation and distribution has not been fundamentally changed. This system establishes a stable relationship between personnel and departments after allocation, suppressing individuals' right to choose their careers and organizations' right to hire. The social security system for the "mutual selection" right has not yet been formed, while the current system of enterprises providing social welfare has strengthened the dependence of talent on enterprises. Traditional concepts formed under the conditions of a product economy have not been eliminated. The management of talent mobility is led by multiple authorities with unclear responsibilities.

### 统包统配未动根本　双向选择尚无保障  专业人才一生流动不到一次

    统包统配未动根本　双向选择尚无保障
    专业人才一生流动不到一次
    新华社北京3月1日电　（记者胡清海）据有关部门最新统计，目前我国科研、高校和大中型企业的专业技术人员年均流动率不到2％，专业技术人员一生中的流动次数还不到一次。
    据了解，现在全国已有40多个省、直辖市、部委、250多个地市、1000多个县成立了人才交流服务机构，从上到下基本形成了人才流动服务网络。
    据有关部门介绍，近年来，人才流向已呈正向和逆向交叉的多元化趋势。
    我国的人才流动工作近几年虽然取得一定进展，但从总体上看，人才流动难仍是目前的主要倾向。据有关部门分析，造成人才流动难的根本原因是：以统包统配为特征的人才管理体制并未从根本上触动。这种体制使人员分配后即与部门之间建立了稳定关系，抑制了个人的择业权和单位的用人权。“双向选择”权利的社会保障体系尚未形成，而现行的以单位办社会福利的体系，强化了人才对单位的依附关系。在产品经济条件下形成的传统观念尚未破除。人才流动管理工作的多头领导，职责不清。
