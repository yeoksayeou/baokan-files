West Germany to Increase Funding for Universities

	NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- West German Chancellor Kohl and the premiers of West German states signed a joint assistance plan in Bonn on March 10 to increase funding for universities.

	Currently, West German universities have a total of 1.5 million students. In recent years, many universities and departments have faced severe challenges due to overcrowding, insufficient faculty, and inadequate teaching facilities. The joint assistance plan signed today stipulates that over the next seven years, the federal and state governments will allocate 2.1 billion marks to universities and departments facing particularly severe difficulties, such as business administration, information science, electronics, and mechanical engineering.

	UK to Implement Worker Training Plan

	NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Thatcher announced a 3 billion pound (approximately 6.9 billion dollars) training plan in Newcastle, northern England, on March 9. The plan aims to establish 100 private enterprise training institutions in the UK by 1993.

	This private training plan is an innovation in the training methods for British workers and will replace all existing government training programs.
