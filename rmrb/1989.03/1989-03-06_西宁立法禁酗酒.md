Xining Enacts Law to Prohibit Drunkenness

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xining, March 4th - Yesterday's meeting of the Seventh Session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh People's Congress of Qinghai Province approved the "Regulations on Strictly Prohibiting Drunkenness and Causing Trouble in Xining City" drafted by the Standing Committee of the Xining City People's Congress. The enactment of this local regulation provides a legal basis for eliminating the increasingly prominent problems of drunkenness and criminal behavior after drinking in the Xining area.

Drunkenness and criminal behavior after drinking have long seriously affected the normal social order in the Xining area. In 1987, public security cases induced by drunkenness accounted for 46.1% of all public security cases in the city. Among these, there were 64 cases of assault with a knife after drinking, accounting for 42.6% of all assault cases.

　　西宁立法禁酗酒
    据新华社西宁３月４日电  （记者王宏伟）昨天举行的青海省七届人大常委会第七次会议审议批准了西宁市人大常委会制定的《西宁市严禁酗酒滋事的规定》。这一地方性法规的制定，为消除西宁地区日益突出的酗酒滋事和酒后犯罪现象，提供了法律依据。酗酒滋事和酒后犯罪行为，多年来一直严重影响着西宁地区的社会正常秩序。１９８７年全市因酗酒诱发的治安案件占全部治安案件的４６．１％，其中酒后持刀伤人案件有６４起，占全部伤人案件４２．６％。
