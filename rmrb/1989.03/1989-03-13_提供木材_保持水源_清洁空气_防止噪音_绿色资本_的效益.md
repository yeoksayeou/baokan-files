	Providing Timber, Maintaining Water Sources,
	Cleaning the Air, Reducing Noise
	The Benefits of "Green Capital"
	By Jiang Jian Guo, Reporter for People's Daily

	In West Germany, trees seem to follow you wherever you travel. Even in large cities like Munich and Frankfurt, there are vast forests.

	Recently, the reporter visited Dr. Anton Hammer, the director of the Forestry Bureau in Baden-Baden and the chairman of the Urban Forestry Working Committee.

	Dr. Hammer said that the national forest coverage rate in West Germany is 20%, with a forest area of 7.3 million hectares. 31% of the forests are state-owned, 44% are privately owned, and 25% are owned by municipalities. There are 27,000 forestry personnel. The Urban Forestry Working Committee, established seven or eight years ago, holds a federal-level meeting at least every two years to exchange experiences.

	Baden-Baden has the most urban forests in West Germany. The forest area accounts for 61% of the city's total area. The famous Black Forest originates from here.

	Dr. Hammer said that forests are not just timber production bases for cities; more importantly, they are places for rest and recuperation, sources of clean water and fresh air, and barriers against noise. Baden-Baden, a small city, has become a famous European spa and tourist destination, as well as a conference center, thanks to its forests. A book about the local forests given to the reporter by Dr. Hammer contains the following figures: the water storage capacity in the forest area is 50 to 200 liters per square meter, and each hectare absorbs 68 tons of dust annually. The concentration of floating dust in the forest air is one-twentieth to one-thousandth of that in industrial cities. Therefore, Baden-Baden people call it "green capital" and "green lungs."

	Dr. Hammer introduced that the task of the city's forestry bureau is to protect and utilize this "green capital." West Germany has forestry laws at all levels, with each level being more stringent and detailed. One ancient and unchanging principle is that the amount of timber cut should not exceed the growth amount, and for every tree cut, another must be planted. He said that the city's forestry bureau divides the municipal forests into several different protection levels. The first level is the nature reserve and "natural monument." The purpose is to protect precious tree species and animals. Next is the scenic protection area.

	The strict management is for better utilization. The annual income from timber production in Baden-Baden's urban forests is approximately 40 million marks, all of which is used for forest management and construction. More importantly, it is used for tourism, rest, and hunting. Regarding hunting, Dr. Hammer said that it should be beneficial for maintaining ecological balance. There are strict regulations on the types and quantities of game, and violations will result in heavy fines or imprisonment. It is particularly worth mentioning that 12 kilometers of educational paths have been opened in the forest area to disseminate forestry knowledge.

	Dr. Hammer pointed out that in recent years, industrial acid rain has caused significant damage to forests. However, the situation has improved with planned fertilization and reduced soil acidification.

	At the end of the interview, Dr. Hammer said, "I have been a 'forestry official' all my life and am very fond of this job because it is a cause that benefits future generations."

### 提供木材　保持水源  清洁空气　防止噪音 “绿色资本”的效益

　　提供木材　保持水源
    清洁空气　防止噪音
   “绿色资本”的效益
    本报记者  江建国
    西德　在西德各地旅行，树总像影子似地伴随着你。即使慕尼黑、法兰克福这些大城市，也都有大片的森林。
    最近，记者专程访问了巴登—巴登市的森林管理局局长、城市森林工作委员会主席安东·哈默博士。
    哈默博士说，西德全国森林覆盖率为２０％，森林面积为７３０万公顷。３１％是国有林，４４％是私有林，２５％为市镇所有，林业人员２７０００人。城市森林工作委员会成立七八年来，至少每两年召开一次联邦级会议，交流经验。
    巴登—巴登是西德城市森林最多的地方。森林面积占全市面积的６１％。著名的黑森林就从这里发端。
    哈默博士说，森林对于城市来说，不仅仅是木材生产基地，更主要的是休息疗养之地、清洁的水源和清新空气的基地，是防止噪音的一堵墙。巴登—巴登这个小城能成为欧洲驰名的疗养城、旅游胜地，会议中心，与森林是有关的。哈默博士送给记者的一本关于本地森林的书中有这样几个数字：林区每平方米蓄水量为５０至２００升，每公顷每年消化６８吨灰尘。林间空气中的浮尘是工业城市的二万分之一到一千分之一。巴登—巴登人因此称它是“绿色的资本”、“绿色的肺”。
    哈默博士介绍，对于这“绿色的资本”，市林管局的任务一是保护，二是利用。西德各级均有森林法，一级比一级严格细致。其中，一个古老不变的原则是砍伐量不得超过生长量，砍多少棵种多少棵。他说，市林管区把市属森林分成几个不同的保护等级。第一等是自然保护区和“自然纪念碑”。目的是保护珍贵的树种和动物。其次是风景保护区。
    管严的目的是为了用好。巴登—巴登城市森林生产的木材年收入约４００万马克，全部用于森林管理建设，更重要的是用于旅游，休养，狩猎。提到狩猎，哈默博士说，这要有利于维持生态平衡。同时对狩猎品种和数量都有严格规定，违反规定要罚以巨款或坐牢。特别值得一提的是，在林区还开辟了１２公里的教学用路，传播林业知识。
    哈默博士指出，近年来工业酸雨对森林损害很大，由于有计划地施以肥料，减少土壤酸化，情况已有好转。
    采访结束时，哈默博士说，他当了一辈子的“林务官，十分热爱这个工作，因为这是为子孙造福的事业”。
