The Polish Interior Minister, Kiszczak, met today with former Solidarity Union Chairman Walesa to exchange views on the discussions held over the past four weeks at the "Round Table Conference."

The "Round Table Conference" began on February 6 in Warsaw, with 57 representatives from various sectors of Polish society discussing issues such as economic, political, and social reforms, the diversification of trade unions, and the future development of Poland. Over the past four weeks, the conference has made some progress. Representatives have reached a consensus or are close to agreeing on issues such as implementing local autonomy, allowing the Solidarity Union to publish newspapers, and holding non-confrontational parliamentary elections. However, on key issues such as the Solidarity Union's share of radio and television programs, social supervision and intervention in economic reforms, and the appointment of officials, there are still significant differences of opinion among the representatives.

During today's meeting, Kiszczak and Walesa will review the discussions of the past four weeks and make efforts to resolve differences and reach a comprehensive agreement. Analysts here estimate that both sides will make concessions on some specific issues to enable the "Round Table Conference" to achieve the long-awaited national reconciliation that the Polish people desire.

According to the pre-arranged plan, the "Round Table Conference" will last six weeks and is scheduled to conclude in late March. The Polish government spokesman, Urban, believes that the final two weeks are crucial for the conference's successful conclusion. He said that the conference will sign a comprehensive agreement on issues related to overcoming the economic crisis and economic and political reforms.

It is believed that whether these goals can be achieved will depend on the sincerity of the representatives participating in the "Round Table Conference," especially the sincerity of the Solidarity Union representatives. Therefore, Kiszczak's fifth meeting with Walesa will, to a large extent, determine the progress of the "Round Table Conference."

　　波兰内务部长会见瓦文萨
    就圆桌会议交换意见
    新华社华沙３月２日电  （记者汤德乔）波兰内务部长基什查克今天在这里会见前团结工会主席瓦文萨，就“圆桌会议”４周来的讨论情况交换意见。
    “圆桌会议”于２月６日在华沙开始，５７名波兰各界代表在会上讨论了波国内经济、政治、社会改革、工会多元化以及有关波兰今后发展等问题。４周来，会议取得了一定进展，各方代表在实行地方自治、允许团结工会创办报纸、进行非对抗性的议会选举问题上观点一致或接近，但在关于团结工会分享电台、电视台节目、对经济改革进行社会监督和干部任命制等关键问题上各方代表各执己见，存在分歧。基什查克与瓦文萨在今天的会晤中，将回顾４周来的讨论情况，并为消除意见分歧、达成一揽子协议作出努力。此间分析家们估计，双方将在一些具体问题上作出妥协，以使“圆桌会议”能达成波兰人民期望已久的民族谅解。
    按照预先计划，“圆桌会议”举行６周，将于３月下旬闭幕。波兰政府发言人乌尔班认为，最后２周对会议的圆满成功至关重要。他说，会议将签署一揽子有关克服经济危机、经济和政治改革等问题的协议。
    据认为，这一切能否如愿以偿，将取决于参加“圆桌会议”的各方代表的诚意，首先是团结工会代表的诚意。因此，基什查克与瓦文萨第５次会晤将在很大程度上决定“圆桌会议”的进程。
