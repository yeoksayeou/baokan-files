	Wu Shaozu, the director of the State Sports Commission, said at the national sports competition work conference today that implementing the Olympic strategy must adhere to the principle of shortening the front and emphasizing key points.

	He pointed out that our country's experience and lessons from participating in the Olympics twice tell us that to achieve good results in the Olympics, we must grasp the main contradictions, concentrate our forces to fight decisive battles, and implement the idea of the whole country as one chessboard, achieving "domestic training, unified against the outside."

	Wu Shaozu believes that the main problem to be solved at present is that the country implements the Olympic strategy, and each place implements the Full National Games strategy, with inconsistent ideas and unable to unite as one. He hopes that the comrades in the sports sector will unify their understanding and truly understand that we need to implement the Olympic strategy, and local areas need to make sacrifices.

	How to emphasize the Olympic strategy? He pointed out that the projects set by the Full National Games should align with the Olympics, and the seventh Full National Games should follow this principle; key points should be emphasized, concentrating human, financial, and material resources; a scientific scoring method should be formulated, and an evaluation system beneficial to the Olympic strategy should be established; for some projects not included in the seventh Full National Games, protective measures should be taken, such as recording the results of a few winter projects in the seventh Full National Games, and mandatorily retaining advantageous projects like parachuting; for those who contribute to the Olympic strategy, there should be a set of reward measures.

	When talking about competition work, Wu Shaozu said that competition is the soul of sports work, the connection point between competitive sports and mass sports, and a charming thing that can attract the masses to participate in sports activities. To better play the leveraging role of competitions, it is necessary to handle the relationship between competitions and training. Training is the center, with its own rules and systematic, scientific nature, while competitions are a verification and promotion of training.

	Regarding the issue of competition ethics, Wu Shaozu strongly called for no disturbances, no strikes, or fights; opposed falsification, falsifying age and identity; and severely punished those who violate regulations by taking stimulants.

	The conference, which ended today in Beijing, discussed the project plan for the seventh Full National Games and commended the best and excellent competition areas in 1988, as well as 505 national excellent referees.

　　伍绍祖说奥运战略要突出重点
    全运会项目应向奥运会靠拢
    新华社北京３月１３日电  （中国体育报记者张平平、新华社记者王俊璞）国家体委主任伍绍祖今天在全国体育竞赛工作会议上说，实行奥运战略，一定要贯彻缩短战线、突出重点的方针。
    他指出，我国两次参加奥运会的经验、教训告诉我们，要在奥运会上取得好成绩，必须抓主要矛盾，集中兵力打歼灭战，贯彻全国一盘棋思想，做到“国内练兵，一致对外”。
    伍绍祖认为，当前需要解决的主要问题是，国家实行奥运战略，各地实行全运战略，想法不一致，拧不成一股绳。他希望体育战线的同志要统一认识，真正理解我们要实行奥运战略，局部要做出牺牲。
    如何突出奥运战略？他指出，全运会所设项目要向奥运会靠拢，第七届全运会应按这一原则；要突出重点，集中使用人力、财力和物力；要制定科学的记分办法，建立有利于奥运战略的评价体系；对没有列入七运会的一些项目，采取照顾或保护措施，如少数冬季项目的成绩在七运会中记分，跳伞等优势项目作指令性保留；对那些为奥运战略做出贡献的，要有一套奖励办法。
    伍绍祖在谈到竞赛工作时说，竞赛是体育工作的灵魂，是竞技体育与群众体育的连接点，是具有魅力的一件事，可以把群众吸引到体育活动中来。要更好地发挥竞赛的杠杆作用，必须处理好竞赛与训练的关系，训练是中心，有它自己的规律和系统性、科学性，竞赛则是对训练的检验、促进。
    谈到赛风问题，伍绍祖大声疾呼，绝不允许闹事，不允许出现罢赛、打架等不良现象；反对弄虚作假，虚报年龄、身份；如有违反规定服用兴奋剂者，严惩不殆。
    今天在北京结束的这次会议，讨论了七运会设项方案等问题，并表彰了１９８８年全国最佳赛区和优秀赛区，以及５０５名全国优秀裁判员。
