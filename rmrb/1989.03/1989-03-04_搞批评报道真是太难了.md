In late September 1988, we went to Tian Tai Township in the suburban district of Fuling City to investigate the issue of some leading cadres in the suburban district and Tian Tai Township arbitrarily using handcuffs to detain and beat farmers Hu Zuxiao, Hu Shunan, Wang Changming, and Yuan Wanjun.

After the investigation, we exchanged views with Township Head Zhang Zaifu and District Committee Secretary Zeng Guangwen, and suggested that they handle the matter seriously. However, during our investigation, Zhang Zaifu called the editorial department of our newspaper and said, "You should handle this matter carefully, otherwise, our township will not subscribe to the Fuling Daily next year." Zeng Guangwen also sent people to our newspaper office to plead on two occasions. When Zeng Guangwen and Zhang Zaifu learned that we had reported the situation to the municipal committee, they wrote a letter to the Fuling Regional Committee and Administrative Office on behalf of some grassroots cadres in Tian Tai Township, complaining about us. Zhang Zaifu also told the villagers, "You shouldn't make trouble anymore. The two reporters who came to investigate last time have been arrested by the public security bureau," and so on.

Due to their obstruction, the problem of some cadres in Fuling City's suburban district violating laws and discipline has not been resolved to this day.

　　搞批评报道真是太难了
    １９８８年９月下旬，我们前往涪陵市城郊区天台乡，调查城郊区和天台乡个别领导干部随意动用手铐拘禁、拷打农民胡祖超、胡顺安、王长明、袁万军等人的问题。
    调查结束后，我们与天台乡乡长张在福和城郊区委书记曾广文交换了意见，并建议他们认真处理。然而，就在我们调查期间，张在福就打电话给我报社编辑部说，你们要慎重处理这件事，否则，我乡不订明年的涪陵日报。曾广文还先后两次派人到我们报社说情。当曾广文、张在福等人知道我们向市委反映情况后，他们便以天台乡部分基层干部的名义，向涪陵地委、行署写信，告我们的状；张在福还对村里的农民说：“你们不要闹了。上次来调查的那两个记者被公安局抓了”等等。
    由于他们的阻挠，涪陵市城郊区个别干部违法乱纪的问题至今未得到处理。
