Zhou Ziqi, aged 65, was originally an engineer at the county's Water Conservancy and Agricultural Machinery Bureau. In 1983, when he retired, his wife suggested he return to his hometown in Su'nan to enjoy his retirement, but he insisted on staying in the county, willing to contribute to the water conservancy cause.

In the summer of 1984, Shanghai's Chuandong Farm commissioned the county's Water Conservancy and Agricultural Machinery Bureau to design a supplementary project for the Nonggan River, which needed to be completed before the flood season. This design was time-sensitive, had high requirements, and was technically complex. Zhou Ziqi took on the task and, despite the scorching heat, worked for over 90 days, averaging more than 10 hours a day, including holidays, to successfully complete the 500,000-character design book and related charts.

After retiring, Zhou Ziqi also served as a technical consultant for the county's Water Conservancy Survey and Design Office and the county's Second Construction Company. In the winter of 1985, the Second Construction Company was building a high-capacity wine storage facility in Anhui Province, with a construction cost of 680,000 yuan. During the construction, the concrete impermeability test did not meet the design requirements. The company's leadership sought out Zhou, who immediately rushed to the construction site hundreds of kilometers away in Suzhou City. After repeated observations, calculations, and experiments, he found a solution to the problem, timely preventing a quality accident and saving the Second Construction Company over 100,000 yuan. To improve the technical skills of the company's technical staff, Zhou also wrote relevant teaching materials and trained 25 technical backbones.

To share his years of experience and insights, and to help future workers avoid detours, Zhou Ziqi proactively requested to write the "Water Conservancy Chronicle of Dafeng County" for the county's archives office. To complete this task, Zhou worked tirelessly for 9 months, reviewing his notes from over 30 years of work in Dafeng County, visiting hundreds of knowledgeable individuals, and completing a 300,000-character draft despite being ill. To develop the county's coastal tidal flats, Zhou walked over 250 kilometers to conduct surveys and inspections, and based on his experience, wrote a report. This report provided new arguments and solutions for developing tidal flats and improving saline-alkali lands, and was included in the "Compilation of Chinese Agricultural Engineering," receiving recognition and awards from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

In recent years, Zhou has designed 26 water conservancy projects, solved 27 construction technical problems, organized and directed 45 construction projects, and written 1.1 million characters of materials and textbooks. However, most of the work Zhou has done is voluntary and unpaid.

　　离休后继续作奉献  周子期是个好党员
    ６５岁的周子期，原是我县水利农机局的工程师，１９８３年离职休养时，老伴劝他回苏南家乡享享清福，但他坚持留在我县，愿为水利事业尽点力。
    １９８４年夏，上海市川东农场委托我县水利农机局设计农干河配套工程，要求在汛期前完成。这项设计时间紧、要求高、技术复杂。周子期揽了下来后，冒着酷暑，苦熬了９０多天，平均每天工作１０多个小时，节假日也不休息，圆满完成了５０万字的设计书和有关图表。
    周子期离休后还担任县水利勘测设计室、县第二建筑公司技术顾问。１９８５年冬，县二建公司在安徽省承建高沪酒库工程，造价６８万元。在施工中，混凝土防渗试验达不到设计要求。县二建公司领导人找到老周，他立即赶到数百公里之外的宿州市工地。经过反复观察、计算、试验，他终于找到了解决问题的办法，及时地排除了质量事故，为县二建公司挽回１０多万元的经济损失。为了提高县二建公司技术人员的技术素质，老周还为他们编写了有关教材，培训了２５名技术骨干。
    为了把自己多年的体会和经验写出来，使后人工作少走弯路，周子期主动向县志办公室请求编写大丰县水利志。为了完成这一任务，老周废寝忘食地翻阅了自己在大丰县工作３０多年记下的几百万字的笔记，走访了数百名知情人，带病干了９个月，完成了３０万字的初稿。为了开发我县的沿海滩涂，老周步行２５０多公里调查勘测，并结合自己的经验，写成了一份调查报告。这份调查报告为开发滩涂、改造盐碱地提供了新的论据和出路，被编入《中国农业工程汇编》，受到中国农科院的表彰和奖励。
    这几年，老周设计大小水利工程２６项，解决施工技术难题２７个，组织指导建筑工程４５处，编写资料、教材１１０万字。然而，老周所干的这些工作，大部分是无偿服务。
