Yu Zhengsheng, a delegate to the Seventh National People's Congress and the mayor of Yantai City, told reporters that one of his main thoughts during the review of the government work report was to establish several pilot zones to better implement the series of policies and directives on rectification and deepening reform issued by the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

He believes that there are some deficiencies in the current laws and regulations, and generally, the penalties are too light, which creates loopholes in law enforcement and leads to market chaos and a weak government.

Such pilot zones can be seen as a comprehensive experimental zone that integrates legal system construction, rectification, and reform. The main feature is that legal authorization should be significant, and the measures for reform and rectification should be reflected through legal forms to strengthen legal system construction and use it to drive reform and rectification. Currently, the focus should be on solving two major issues: market order and government integrity.

　　俞正声建议：设立整治试验区
    本报记者  于宁
    “为了使党中央、国务院制定的治理整顿、深化改革的一系列方针、政策更好地落实，最好能设立几个试验区，摸索办法和经验。”七届全国人大代表、烟台市市长俞正声告诉记者，这是他在审议政府工作报告时最主要的想法之一。
    他认为，现行的法律、法规有一些不足之处，一般来讲处罚偏轻，给执法过程中出现一些不正当的现象造成空隙，于是形成混乱的市场，软弱的政府。
    这种试验区，可以说是法制建设、治理整顿和改革三者结合起来的综合性试验区，主要特点是法律授权要大，改革的措施、治理整顿的措施要通过法律的形式来体现，强化法制建设，用法制建设来带动改革和整顿。当前要突出解决市场秩序和政府的廉洁两大问题。
