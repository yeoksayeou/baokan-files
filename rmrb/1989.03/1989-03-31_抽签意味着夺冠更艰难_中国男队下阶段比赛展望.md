The draw for the second stage of the team competition has been revealed, and insiders can see that the prospects for both the Chinese men's and women's teams are grim, especially for the men's team. Regardless of the fact that the West German men's team is in top form and will pose a significant threat to the Chinese players, the most unfavorable situation for the Chinese team is that the Swedish men's team and the South Korean men's team are in the same group. As long as these two teams give their all to defeat the Chinese Taipei team, regardless of the outcome of their match against each other, they will both advance. After advancing, one of these two teams will definitely be drawn into the same half as the Chinese team in the third stage of the knockout round. This means that the Chinese team will definitely face either the South Korean team or the Swedish team before reaching the final, or even before reaching the top four. The unfavorable draw in the second stage has laid a dangerous trap for the Chinese men's team in the third stage.

　　抽签意味着夺冠更艰难        
    ——中国男队下阶段比赛展望
    团体赛第二阶段抽签揭晓后，内行的人一眼看出中国男女队前景严峻，尤其是男队。且不说同组的西德男队气势正旺，将给中国小伙子造成很大威胁。对中国队最不利之处在于，瑞典男队和南朝鲜男队抽在同一个组，他们两个队只要全力拚掉中国台北队，无论相互之间胜负如何，都将双双出线。出线后在第三阶段淘汰赛中，这两个队必有一队会抽在中国队这半区。也就是说，中国队在进入决赛前、甚至进入前４名以前，就肯定要碰上南朝鲜队或瑞典队，如果失利连争冠资格都没有。第二阶段抽签的不理想给中国男队第三阶段埋下危险。
