Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 27th.

The Soviet Union's Defense Minister, Yazov, announced on the 27th the timeline for reducing Soviet troops stationed in Eastern Europe and withdrawing them back to Soviet territory.

Yazov made this announcement during an interview with the Soviet newspaper *Izvestia*, which published his remarks today.

Yazov stated that the unilateral reduction of troops will be carried out in phases over the next two years. Each year, the first half will be a preparation phase, during which measures will be taken to change the organizational structure of combined arms units, transforming them into a defensive nature. From May to August each year will be the second phase, during which the troops to be reduced will be withdrawn back to Soviet territory.

Yazov said that by August 15th of this year, the Soviet Union will reduce two tank divisions in East Germany and one tank division in Hungary. Additionally, 24 tactical missile launchers, 2,700 tanks, and other equipment will be reduced.

In 1990, the Soviet military will withdraw two tank divisions from East Germany and one tank division from Czechoslovakia. They will also withdraw airborne assault forces, river crossing landing forces, and 260 combat aircraft from these countries. By the end of 1990, the troop reduction tasks will be fully completed.

Yazov said that after the restructuring of the Soviet armed forces, the number of combined arms divisions will be halved.

He also announced that the Soviet Union will invite foreign journalists to observe the aforementioned troop reduction activities.

　　苏宣布裁减东欧驻军时间表
    新华社莫斯科２月２７日电  苏联国防部长亚佐夫２７日宣布了苏联裁减驻东欧部队并将其撤回苏联本土的时间表。
    亚佐夫是对苏联《消息报》发表谈话时作这一宣布的。该报今天发表了他的谈话。
    亚佐夫说，苏联单方面裁军将在今明两年内分阶段进行。每年上半年为准备阶段，采取措施，改变诸兵种合成兵团的组织结构，使其转向防御性质。每年５月至８月为第二阶段，将应裁减的部队撤回苏联本土。
    亚佐夫说，今年８月１５日前苏联将裁减驻民主德国的两个坦克师和驻匈牙利的１个坦克师。同时，将削减２４个战术导弹发射装置、２７００辆坦克和其它装备。
    １９９０年苏军将从民主德国撤回两个坦克师，从捷克斯洛伐克撤回１个坦克师。还将从这些国家撤回空降强击部队、渡河登陆部队以及２６０架作战飞机。到１９９０年底全部完成裁军任务。
    亚佐夫说，苏联武装力量的结构改变后，诸兵种合成师的数量将减少一半。
    他还宣布，苏联将邀请外国记者参观上述裁军活动。
