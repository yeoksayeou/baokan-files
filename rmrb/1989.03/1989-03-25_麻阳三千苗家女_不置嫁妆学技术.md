The new folk song of the Miao people, "A good son does not need his mother's land, a good daughter does not seek a dowry; she does not care if her home has everything, but only wants a pair of skillful hands," reflects the changing marriage concepts of Miao girls in our county today.

Over the past year, 3,165 Miao girls in our county's rural areas have used the money they would have spent on dowries to go to the city or other places to learn technical skills in livestock raising, planting, processing, and repair work.

The county has taken note of the new demands of rural Miao girls and allocated more than 200,000 yuan in special funds for training last year. The county's Communist Youth League and Women's Federation, along with other organizations, have actively coordinated with science and technology, agricultural technology, and animal husbandry and fisheries departments to hold more than 200 training sessions on over 10 different technical skills, creating conditions for Miao girls to learn these skills. Some of these girls, after completing their training, have become key figures in the county's cow, goose, and pig farming industries. For example, Zheng Aixiang, a Miao girl from Jun Tian Village in Huangshuang Township, loves raising cows. She spent 1,000 yuan to study livestock breeding and veterinary medicine at the regional animal husbandry and veterinary school. After marrying, she started a cow farming business in April of last year. The 12 cows she raised are all healthy and well-fed. So far, her family has sold 10 draft cows, earning more than 7,000 yuan. At the beginning of last year, Ou Xiaomei, a Miao girl from Longpan Village in Lanchun Township, spent 1,500 yuan to learn radio and television repair technology in the county. Now, she often repairs televisions and tape recorders for her fellow villagers.

　　麻阳三千苗家女　不置嫁妆学技术
    “好儿不要娘田土，好女不把嫁妆求；不图家中样样有，但求有双灵巧手。”这首苗家新山歌，反映了当今我县苗家姑娘婚嫁观念的新变化。
    去年以来，我县农村已有３１６５名苗家姑娘，用准备购置嫁妆的钱，进城或到外地学习饲养、种植、加工和修理等技术。
    县里注意到了农村苗家姑娘的这种新要求，去年特地拨出了２０多万元专款作为培训经费。县共青团和妇联等组织也主动与科技、农技和畜牧水产等部门联系，举办了２００多期１０多种技术的培训班，为苗家姑娘学技术创造条件。一些姑娘学成后，成为县里养牛、养鹅和养猪的骨干力量。例如，黄双乡军田村苗族姑娘郑爱香喜欢养牛，花１０００元到地区畜牧兽医学校学习养殖和兽医技术。她到婆家后，于去年４月搞起了养牛业，饲养的１２头牛，头头膘肥体壮。到目前为止，她家已出栏耕牛１０头，获利７０００多元。去年初，兰村乡龙盘村苗族姑娘欧小梅花１５００元到县里学习无线电和电视机的修理技术。现在，她经常给乡亲们修理电视机和收录机。
