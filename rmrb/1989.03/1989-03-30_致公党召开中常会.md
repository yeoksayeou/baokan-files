The second session (expanded) of the ninth Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party was held in Beijing on March 26th.

Attendees carefully studied and discussed the spirit of the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress and the second session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. They expressed agreement with the government work report delivered by Li Peng. The meeting believed that the objectives and policies for rectification and austerity measures outlined in the government work report are clear, and the tasks are feasible. As long as the established policies, measures, and guidelines are resolutely implemented, the difficulties on the path forward can be overcome, and greater achievements in rectification and austerity can be realized.

The meeting called on all members of the China Zhi Gong Party to seriously study and understand the spirit of the "two sessions," actively participate in the practice of rectification and austerity and deepening reforms, and contribute to the implementation of the objectives and measures for rectification and austerity over the next two years as determined by the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress.
