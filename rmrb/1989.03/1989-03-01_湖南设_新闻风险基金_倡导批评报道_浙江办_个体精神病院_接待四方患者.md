Hunan's *News Picture Newspaper* has established a "news risk" fund starting from this year's January.

A six-year-old girl named Liú Yù Jié from Taishan Temple Village, Laohekou City, Hubei Province, can see in the dark with her right eye. Even with the lights off, she can kill mosquitoes inside the mosquito net and pick up small items like needles and threads from the ground. (Jiàn Bào)

Wang Huí Qín, a young woman from Zhejiang, has opened the country's first private mental hospital. She is a village doctor from Donglian Village, Sanlian Township, Shangyu County, with only a junior high school education. However, through years of unremitting effort and learning from masters, she has mastered a unique skill in treating mental illnesses. Since she started practicing medicine, she has treated over 2,000 patients from within and outside the province. (Zēng Zhāo Píng)
