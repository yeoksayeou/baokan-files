And County, known for its abundant production of rice, cotton, oilseeds, and vegetables, braved the wind and snow to enter its 11th spring since the reforms. The day after the Lantern Festival, a reporter visited this county.

In the morning, snowflakes danced, and in the afternoon, a fine rain fell. County Party Secretary Hong Lianwen introduced to me: To ensure a bumper harvest this year, on the eighth day of the lunar new year, they invited village, township, district, and county-level cadres to the county to discuss urgent matters. He also frequently glanced at the sky, anxiously saying, "It has been raining for more than ten days. The 200,000 mu of wheat, 300,000 mu of rapeseed, and 50,000 mu of vegetables in the fields must quickly be drained to prevent frost and disease..."

He invited me to rush to the county's largest agricultural area, Shenxiang District, to take a look. Along the way, everything was lush, with hardly any idle land. The wheat and rapeseed were growing well. It was just that the water in the ridges and furrows was too much. In the evening, we arrived at the district. The district Party Secretary Li Daqiang, who had just returned from the fields, seemed to understand Secretary Hong's thoughts and immediately said, "Our most urgent task is to mobilize all the farmers in the district to go to the fields to drain the water and protect the roots of the crops."

He then listed a series of "urgent tasks": hybrid rice seeds are still short by half, fertilizers are short by one-third, wheat fields have wheat mites, rapeseed stems have aphids, and the specialized pesticides are still not available...

The "urgent tasks" are endless, and for this year's bumper harvest, people's hearts are racing in the "spring rush"!

The next day, rain mixed with hail fell all day. I went to Chengnan Township. Here, there were plastic greenhouses everywhere, and few villagers were seen. Upon inquiry, it turned out that all the men, women, and children in the township had been guarding the vegetable greenhouses day and night for the past two days. As soon as there was snow on the greenhouses, they gently brushed it off, fearing that the hail would break the greenhouse tops...

A villager from Taiping Village, Huang Jialai, said that early spring vegetables are now on the market or about to be on the market. This year's spring chili peppers can be harvested a month earlier than usual. If the greenhouse gets sick, not only will our economy suffer, but the residents of nearby Nanjing, Wuhu, and Ma'anshan will also face a big problem with their vegetable supply. These past few nights, at least 1,500 people in the village have been resisting the wind and snow in the greenhouses.

On the 23rd, wind, rain, and hail struck simultaneously. People sitting indoors felt very cold. The county's functional departments were busy as ever. Procurement personnel, some of whom had just returned from the rain, and others who were about to go out into the wind; the phones and telegrams for linking agricultural resources were constantly coming and going. Half of the fertilizers have been secured, and the power department has elevated agricultural electricity from "last priority" to "top priority," but the gap is still too large. They hope that the East China Power Grid can send more electricity...

From February 24th to March 4th, the reporter also traveled around the rural areas of southern Anhui along the Yangtze River, and everywhere was a scene of spring busyness and hope.

　　雨雪知春归
    ——和县三日记
    本报记者  张振国
    盛产大米、棉花、油料、蔬菜的安徽和县，顶风冒雪步入改革后的第１１个春天。元宵节后的第一天，记者走访了这个县。
    上午大雪纷纷，下午细雨蒙蒙。县委书记洪连文一边向我介绍：为争取今年农业丰收，正月初八，他们就把村、乡、区、县四级干部请到县里商讨急务；一边又不时地眼看天象，心急如焚地说：“雨已下了十多日，在田的２０多万亩小麦、３０多万亩油菜、５万多亩蔬菜，必须抓紧抽沟沥水，防冻、防病……”
    他约我赶到全县最大的农业产地——沈巷区看看。一路葱绿，几乎不见闲田。小麦、油菜长势特好。只是横竖成行的垄沟中积水过多。傍晚，我们到达区里。刚从田头回来的区委书记李大量，好像看透了老洪的心思，劈头就说，我们当务之急，就是动员全区农民下田抽沟沥水，保住作物的命根子。
    他紧接着提了一连串的“当务之急”；杂交稻良种尚缺一小半，化肥尚少１／３，麦田里见有麦蜘蛛，油菜芯里发现蚜虫，而专营的农药至今无着落……
    “急务”连连，为了今年丰收，人们的心在“春忙”中跳动！
    次日，雨夹冰雹下了一天。我到城南乡。这里四下一片片塑料大棚，村民寥寥。一打听，才知全乡男女老少这两天都日夜守候在菜棚中。棚上一有积雪，就用手轻轻把它拂去，生怕棚顶被冰雹打破……太平村农民黄家来说，早春细菜正上市，或即将上市，今年春辣椒可比往年提前个把月，棚一出病，不光我们经济受损失，临近的南京、芜湖、马鞍山的市民吃菜也成大问题。这几天晚上，村上最少有１５００人在大棚里抵抗风雪。
    ２３日，风雨冰雹交加。人们坐在屋里，都感到很冷。县里职能部门忙得火热。采购人员，有的正冒雨归来，有的正顶风外出；联系农资的电话、电报来往不断。化肥已到手一大半，电力部门把农业用电由“老小”提到“老大”的位置，但缺口太大，他们希望华东电网能多送些电来……
    ２月２４日到３月４日，记者又在安徽大江南北的农村跑了一圈，所到之处，也都是一片春忙，一片希望。
