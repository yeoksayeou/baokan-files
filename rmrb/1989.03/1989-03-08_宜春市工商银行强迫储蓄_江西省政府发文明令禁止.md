Yichun City Industrial and Commercial Bank Forced Savings
Jiangxi Provincial Government Issues Order to Prohibit

The Yichun City Industrial and Commercial Bank in Jiangxi Province began deducting 25% of the salaries of employees from various enterprises and institutions starting on October 15, 1988, and forcibly saving the amount, causing difficulties for some employees. Most employees are dissatisfied with this forced savings practice and are unaware of when the deductions will stop, whether the deducted salaries will be reimbursed, and when they will be reimbursed. We believe that this practice of forcibly deducting salaries for savings violates the principle of "voluntary deposits" and the constitutional provisions protecting citizens' legal income. The result is that it has caused confusion among the people, damaged the relationship between the government and the people, and also harmed the bank's own reputation.

Response

Since August 1988, our province has faced a severe shortage of funds in production, construction, and circulation. At that time, some profitable enterprises could not secure loans, affecting production; purchasing agricultural and sideline products, some issued blank receipts, some issued invoices but could not get the money, and some did not have money to purchase at all; part of the export products and normal materials and commercial reserves were also affected. In Xindian County, 30% of township enterprises stopped production due to a lack of working capital. In this situation, to cope with the emergency, the provincial, municipal, and county governments actively raised funds from all sides, including mobilizing government officials and employees to voluntarily save, to alleviate the urgent needs of production and purchasing agricultural and sideline products. However, some places, in the process of absorbing savings, violated the principle of "voluntary deposits," deducted employees' salaries, and forcibly saved, causing a very bad influence among the people.

On October 16, Governor Wu Guanzheng, while investigating Poyang Lake, heard the people's opinions on forced savings and immediately instructed Secretary Zhang Fengyu of the Provincial Government to take effective measures to stop the practice of forced deduction of savings. The next day, the Provincial Government issued a telegram, emphasizing that no unit or individual should engage in forced deduction of savings. The Provincial Government issued a notice on November 15, clearly stipulating that those who continue to forcibly deduct and cause dissatisfaction among the people will be held accountable by the leaders of the units.

Currently, the practice of forced deduction of savings in various places in our province has been basically stopped.

### 宜春市工商银行强迫储蓄  江西省政府发文明令禁止

　　宜春市工商银行强迫储蓄
    江西省政府发文明令禁止
    江西宜春市工商银行于１９８８年１０月１５日起，扣发有关企事业单位职工的２５％工资，强行储蓄，给一部分职工生活带来困难。大部分职工对强行储蓄的做法不满；对工资要扣发到何年何月，扣发的工资能否偿还，什么时候偿还，也都一无所知。我们认为，这种强行克扣工资储蓄的做法，违背了“存款自愿”的原则和宪法关于保护公民合法收入的规定，其结果是，造成了人们的思想混乱，有损政府和群众的关系，也损害银行自身的信誉。
    　　　　　　　　江西宜春市民政局　民言
    答复
    １９８８年８月以来，我省生产、建设和流通领域的资金短缺的问题十分突出。当时，一些效益好的企业因贷款得不到保证，生产受到影响；收购农副产品，有的打了白条，有的开了票取不到钱，有的没有钱干脆不收购；部分创汇产品和正常的物资、商业储备也受到影响。新干县有３０％的乡镇企业因缺少流动资金而停产。在这种情况下，为了应急，省、地、县从各方面积极筹措资金，其中包括动员机关干部职工自愿储蓄等，以缓解生产和收购农副产品的燃眉之急。但是，个别地方在吸收储蓄过程中，违背“存款自愿”的原则，扣发职工工资，强行储蓄，在群众中造成了很不好的影响。
    １０月１６日，省长吴官正在鄱阳湖调查时，听到群众对强行储蓄的意见后，连夜电告省政府张逢雨秘书长，指示要采取有力措施，制止强行扣款储蓄的做法。次日，省政府即下发了明传电报，强调任何单位和个人不得搞强行扣款储蓄。省政府于１１月１５日发出通知，明确规定，对继续搞硬性扣款、引起群众不满的要追究单位领导人的责任。
    目前，我省各地强行扣款储蓄的做法已基本被制止。
