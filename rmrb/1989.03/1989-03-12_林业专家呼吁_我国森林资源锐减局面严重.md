Recently, more than 200 experts called for the protection and development of China's forest resources to curb the severe decline in forest resources. The experts pointed out that China's per capita forest area ranks 121st in the world. Over the past decade, the forest area in state-owned forest regions nationwide has decreased by 23.1%, and the forest stock volume has dropped by 22%. By the end of this century, the nation's supply of nearly mature timber suitable for logging will decrease from the current 26 billion cubic meters to 12.48 billion cubic meters, with mature timber nearly exhausted. Due to the decline in forest quality, since the founding of the People's Republic, the area of soil erosion in China has increased by 400,000 square kilometers, with a total soil loss of 5 billion tons. This is equivalent to losing a 1-centimeter-thick layer of fertile soil from all arable land each year. The nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium carried away by annual soil erosion are equal to the amount of chemical fertilizer applied nationwide each year. In the past decade, the average area affected by droughts and floods nationwide has reached 470 million mu, an increase of 65% compared to the early days of the People's Republic. The experts urgently suggest:

(1) The entire nation and society must recognize the crisis facing forest resources and understand the value of forest resources.

(2) Clearly define the ownership of forest resources, reverse the fragmented and ineffective management system, establish goal-oriented management and a responsibility system, and strictly adhere to the Forest Law.

(3) Implement administrative, economic, and legal measures to protect the old forest regions in Northeast and Southwest China. Simultaneously, in the southern and northeastern regions with favorable conditions, designate 200 to 250 million mu of forest land to develop fast-growing, high-yield forests and short-rotation industrial forests.

(4) Rely on science and technology to protect forests and develop forestry.

　　林业专家呼吁
    我国森林资源锐减局面严重
    不久前，２００多名专家呼吁：保护和发展我国森林资源，抑制森林资源继续锐减的严重局面。专家们指出，我国人均占有森林面积居世界第１２１位。１０年来，全国国有林区森林面积减少２３．１％，森林蓄积量下降２２％，到本世纪末，全国可供采伐的近成熟林将由现在的２６亿立方米下降到１２．４８亿立方米，其中成熟林将消耗殆尽。由于森林质量下降，建国以来，我国水土流失面积增加４０万平方公里，流失总量５０亿吨，相当于全国耕地年损失一厘米厚的沃土层，年水土流失带走的氮、磷、钾成份，同全国年施化肥量相等。近１０年全国平均水旱灾害面积达４．７亿亩，比建国初期增加６５％。专家们紧急建议：
    （一）要让全民族、全社会都正视森林资源的危机，认识森林资源的价值。
    （二）明确划分森林资源的所有权，扭转管理体制分散和管理不力局面，建立目标管理和责任制，严格按森林法办事。
    （三）采取行政、经济、法律等综合措施，保护好东北、西南等地的老林区，同时在南方和东北条件好的地区，划出２至２．５亿亩林地，发展速生丰产林和短周期工业林。
    （四）依靠科学技术保护森林，发展林业。
