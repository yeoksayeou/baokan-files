The military has always played a significant role in Argentina's political life. After the military handed over power to a civilian government in December 1983, there have been ongoing disagreements between the two sides and within the military itself, particularly regarding the Falklands War and the prosecution of certain officers. Over the past two years, there have been three instances of military mutiny and two attacks on military barracks. The following account of last December's mutiny may help people understand this important factor influencing Argentina's political situation.

Colonel Ali Seneldin
To discuss this mutiny, one must first introduce this individual. Ali Seneldin is currently 57 years old and is the oldest colonel in the army, known as the "Turk." He does not smoke or drink, follows a vegetarian diet inspired by Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, and is considered a "mysterious figure" within the army.

During the 1982 Falklands War, he led his troops to defend the runway of the capital airport on the Falkland Islands, shooting down a British Harrier jet, and received praise from his superiors. Before withdrawing from the Falklands, he hid his saber in a secret location and swore to his comrades, "One day, we will return!" He was later sent to Panama as a military attaché and served as the operations director of the Second Army. In the past two years, he was hired by Panama as a military advisor.

The Panama Plot
Although Seneldin was in Panama, he maintained close ties with Argentine military personnel. A year ago, when some officers plotted to cause trouble, he thought it was "not the right time." Last autumn, he learned that he was not included in the list of promotions to general at the end of the year, so he took the initiative to become the mastermind of the mutiny. He coordinated the timeline of the operation with his accomplices in the country.

He knew that Argentina's intelligence agency was closely monitoring his movements in Panama. Therefore, although he booked a ticket to return to the country on December 13, he left at the end of November, under the pretext of visiting friends in the Panamanian countryside, and suddenly flew south, landing in Uruguay. After landing, he took a hovercraft to secretly return to the country and went straight to the May Barracks.

At the same time, on the night of November 30, more than 50 soldiers from the "Albatross" squadron of the coastal guard stationed near the presidential palace, Olivos, boarded three trucks with a large amount of weapons and ammunition and left the camp without authorization. On December 1, under Seneldin's command, they occupied the infantry school at the May Barracks and later moved to the 601st Camp in Maltrivi. Seneldin issued a statement declaring that he did not recognize the leadership of Army Chief of Staff General Caridi.

The Park Meeting
After the incident, government troops surrounded the infantry school and dispatched helicopters to hover over the rebel camp. During this time, the sound of grenade explosions mixed with gunfire.

The mutinous soldiers at the 601st Camp were tense as they constructed fortifications and laid mines. Meanwhile, Seneldin and Army Chief of Staff Caridi were negotiating in the park across from the 601st Camp. The commander of the 1st Armored Brigade, General Caseres, was present as a guarantor. They discussed issues such as army unity, ending the prosecution of military personnel, increasing the military budget and salaries. Seneldin also demanded that Caridi retire. The meeting ended successfully, and the mutiny stopped. Two weeks later, Caridi resigned as Army Chief of Staff, and military personnel also received a pay raise.

　　阿根廷兵变内情
    管彦忠
    军队在阿根廷政治生活中历来占有重要地位。１９８３年１２月军政权交权给文人政府以后，双方及军队内部在对待马岛战争及审讯一些军官等问题上一直存在分歧。近两年发生过３次军人哗变和两起袭击兵营的事件。下面记述的去年１２月兵变的一些内情，可能有助于人们了解影响阿根廷政局的这个重要因素。
    塞内尔丁上校　谈这次兵变，必须先介绍这个人。阿里·塞内尔丁现年５７岁，是陆军中年纪最大的上校，人称“土耳其人”。他不嗜烟酒，采用印度圣雄甘地的清真食谱，被视为陆军中的“神秘人物”。
    在１９８２年的马尔维纳斯战争中，他率部保卫马岛首府的机场跑道，击落过英国猎狗式飞机，受到上级表扬。撤离马岛之前，他把马刀藏到一个秘密地点，对同伴发誓说，“总有一天我们会回来的！”他后来被派往巴拿马当过武官，担任过第二军作战部长。前两年，他被巴拿马聘为军事顾问。
    巴拿马密谋　塞内尔丁身在巴拿马，却同阿根廷军人有着密切联系。一年前，有的军官密谋闹事时，他认为“不是时候”。去年秋天，他得知在年底晋升将军的名单中没有他，就主动担当起了兵变的主谋。他跟在国内的同谋商定了行动时间表。
    他知道阿根廷情报机构严密监视着他在巴拿马的行踪。所以，他虽然订了１２月１３日回国的机票，却于１１月底，借故到巴拿马内地向友人辞行，乘上飞机突然南下，在乌拉圭着陆后，他改坐气垫船秘密返回国内，上岸后直奔５月兵营。
    与此同时，即１１月３０日夜晚，驻扎在总统官邸奥利沃斯附近的海岸警卫部队“信天翁”支队５０多名官兵，分乘３辆卡车，带着大批武器弹药，擅自离开营地。１２月１日，他们在塞内尔丁的指挥下占领了５月兵营的步兵学校，后又转移到了马尔特里镇的６０１营。塞内尔丁发表声明，宣布不承认陆军参谋长卡里迪将军的领导。
    公园里的会晤　事件发生后，政府军包围了步兵学校，并出动直升飞机到叛军营地上空盘旋。这时间，手榴弹爆炸声中夹杂着枪声。
    占领６０１营的哗变官兵紧张构筑工事，布设地雷。与此同时，塞内尔丁跟陆军参谋长卡里迪则正在６０１营对面公园里谈判。装甲兵第一旅旅长卡塞雷斯将军在场作保证人，他们谈到了陆军的团结、结束对军人的审讯、增加军事预算和军饷等问题。塞内尔丁还要求卡里迪退役。会晤圆满结束，兵变停止。两周后，卡里迪辞去陆军参谋长职务，军人也增加了工资。
