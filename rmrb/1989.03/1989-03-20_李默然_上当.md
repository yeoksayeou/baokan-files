	Like in previous years, some delegates from the film and television industry at the People's Congress became the focus of many reporters and staff members who requested autographs as soon as they appeared in the Great Hall of the People. The tall and imposing figure of Li Moran became a prime target for autograph seekers during the opening ceremony of the People's Congress on March 19.

	Political Consultative Conference delegate and member of the National Federation of Literature and Art, Zhao Xin, also pushed his way into the small crowd, casually handing over his conference materials bag to Li Moran, requesting an autograph. Li Moran looked up and saw his old friend Zhao Xin smiling at him. He gave Zhao Xin a hearty pat on the shoulder. Amidst the laughter, the two old friends, who had not seen each other in a long time, shook hands tightly.

　　李默然“上当”
    和历年政协大会一样，一些来自影视界的委员在人民大会堂一露脸，许多记者、工作人员就纷纷围上去请求签名留念。身材高大的李默然在３月１９日的政协开幕式上成为签名迷们的重点“捕捉”对象。
    政协委员、全国文联的赵寻也挤进这个小圈子，顺手递上自己装会议文件的材料袋，请李默然签名。李默然一抬头，发现老朋友赵寻正冲着自己乐。他重重地在赵寻肩上拍了一下。在愉快的笑声中，两位久别重逢的老朋友双手紧紧握在一起。
