Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 1st.

Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru said that if the Soviet Union wants to significantly develop its relationship with Japan, it should return the four northern islands to Japan. Once the territorial dispute is resolved, the two countries can sign a peace treaty.

This statement was made by Prime Minister Takeshita during an interview with a journalist from the Soviet newspaper *Izvestia*. It is the first time in decades that a Japanese prime minister has given a talk to a Soviet publication. *Izvestia* published the full text of the interview this evening.

In the interview, Takeshita pointed out that last year, the trade volume between Japan and the Soviet Union reached $5.9 billion, setting a historic high. Cultural exchanges between the two countries have also increased compared to the past. However, since the peace treaty has not been signed, the relationship between the two countries remains unstable.

Prime Minister Takeshita emphasized that the 1855 Japan-Russia Treaty stipulates that the islands of Shikotan, Kunashiri, Etorofu, and Habomai are Japanese territory. Since the end of World War II in 1945, the Soviet Union has occupied these four islands. The Soviet Union previously did not acknowledge the existence of a territorial issue between the Soviet Union and Japan, but now it agrees to discuss this issue. However, its fundamental position has not changed. The Soviet Union should make a political decision on resolving the territorial issue with Japan and signing a peace treaty, and engage in serious dialogue.

Regarding Japan's Asia-Pacific policy, the Japanese prime minister stated that Japan's basic policy is to "ensure peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region," engage in extensive dialogue with countries in this region, and frequently exchange views with the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, which play important roles in maintaining peace and security in the region.

Regarding the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally reduce its military by 500,000 personnel, Prime Minister Takeshita said that if the Soviet Union significantly reduces its military presence in the Far East, it would indicate that the Soviet Union genuinely desires peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. This action would be welcomed.

    竹下登对苏联记者发表谈话
    北方四岛归还日本  日苏关系才能发展
    新华社莫斯科3月1日电  日本首相竹下登说，如果苏联想与日本的关系有大的发展，就应该把北方4岛归还日本。领土争执解决后，两国就可以签订和平条约。
    这是竹下登首相在接受苏联《消息报》记者采访时说的一番话。几十年来日本首相首次对苏联报刊发表谈话。《消息报》今晚全文刊登了这一谈话。
    竹下登在谈话中指出，去年日苏贸易额达59亿美元，创历史最高纪录。双边文化交流也比过去有所增加。但是，由于和平条约尚未签订，两国关系仍不稳定。
    竹下首相指出，1855年日俄条约规定，齿舞、色丹、国后、择捉4岛是日本领土。1945年第二次世界大战结束以来，苏联占领了这4个岛。苏联过去不承认苏日存在领土问题，现在同意讨论这个问题，但是其根本立场尚未改变。苏联应该就与日本解决领土问题和缔结和平条约问题作出政治决定，并着手进行认真的对话。
    在谈到日本的亚太政策时，日本首相说，日本的基本方针是“保证亚太地区和平与稳定”，与这一地区的国家进行广泛对话，同对保障该地区的和平与安全起重要作用的美国、苏联和中国经常交换意见。
    竹下登首相谈到苏联决定单方面裁军50万人的问题时说，如果苏联大量裁减在远东地区的军队，那么就表明苏联确实希望亚太地区的真正和平与局势稳定，这一行动将受到欢迎。
