Xinhua News Agency, Ismalia, March 25th.

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordanian King Hussein, and PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasser Arafat held their second trilateral summit in five months today at noon in Ismalia, a city in the middle of the Suez Canal.

After the trilateral summit, the three leaders held a press conference. President Mubarak said at the conference that the leaders of Jordan, Egypt, and Palestine had exchanged views on the latest developments in the Palestinian issue. This meeting was held just before my visit to the United States and King Hussein's visit to the United States in May, and this opportunity to exchange views is very beneficial.

When asked by our reporter whether it is possible to hold direct talks between Palestine and Israel before the Middle East peace international conference, Chairman Arafat replied that direct talks between Palestine and Israel must be held within the framework of the Middle East peace international conference chaired by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
