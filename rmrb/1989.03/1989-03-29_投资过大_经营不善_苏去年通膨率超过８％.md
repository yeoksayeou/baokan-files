Soviet inflation has been on the rise in recent years due to an overemphasis on the production of means of production, excessive national economic investment, and poor management. The inflation rate for last year reached 8.4%.

The head of the Social Issues, Distribution Relations, and Resident Income Research Office at the Soviet State Planning Commission's Research Institute, Shmarov, revealed in an article published in the 13th issue of this year's "Economic News" that the inflation rate in the consumer sector of the Soviet national economy averaged 5.7% annually from 1981 to 1985. It has been increasing each year since then, reaching 6.2% in 1986 and 7.3% in 1987.

The author noted that the price increases of cooperative products, black-market goods, and services were not included in these statistics.

The article states that last year, resident income increased by 8.5%, but a significant portion of this increase was offset by inflation. In many regions, residents were unable to purchase meat and dairy products from state-owned stores and had to buy goods at negotiated prices. Compared to 1986, the price of essential potatoes increased by one-third, bread by one-quarter, and children's clothing and shoes by half.

Since the start of economic reforms, Soviet enterprises have gained greater freedom in determining product varieties and prices. Enterprise bonuses have increased, and the portion of cooperative income allocated to labor remuneration has been too high, leading to a surge in cash flow. However, anti-inflation measures have not kept pace.

The article advocates for the state to implement savings protection and adjust wages, pensions, and social allowances in accordance with the inflation rate.

    苏去年通膨率超过８％
    新华社莫斯科３月２７日电  苏联由于偏重生产资料生产、国民经济投资过大和经营不善，近年来通货膨胀率逐渐上升，去年已达８．４％。
    苏联国家计委科研所社会问题、分配关系和居民收入研究室主任什马罗夫发表在今年第１３期《经济报》上的文章，首次披露了苏联国民经济消费领域的通货膨胀率：１９８１—１９８５年期间年均为５．７％。此后逐年上升，１９８６年为６．２％，１９８７年为７．３％。
    作者说，合作社产品、黑市商品和劳务的涨价还未统计在内。
    文章说，去年居民收入增长８．５％，相当大部分被通货膨胀抵消了。许多地区的居民由于无法从国营商店买到肉和奶制品，不得不买议价商品。同１９８６年相比，去年苏联人日常生活不可缺的土豆涨价１／３，面包涨价１／４，童装和童鞋涨价１／２。
    自经济改革开始以来，苏联企业在自定产品品种和价格方面获得了较大自由，企业奖金增加，合作社收入中用于劳动报酬的部分过大，现金猛增，但反通货膨胀措施没有跟上。
    这篇文章主张国家实行保值储蓄并根据通货膨胀率相应增加工资、退休金和社会赡养金。
