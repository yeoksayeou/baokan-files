In the Alps between Switzerland and Austria, there is a picturesque and wealthy small principality called Liechtenstein. The country's total land area is only 160 square kilometers, with a population of 27,000. It has the highest per capita income in Europe and no unemployment. For 50 years, Liechtenstein has been governed by a coalition of two parties, maintaining a policy of permanent neutrality and living in peace with the world, with domestic tranquility, like a paradise on earth.

The former head of state, Prince Francis Joseph, ascended the throne in 1938 and only stepped down in 1984 to his son Adam. Prince Joseph advocated women's political rights in the 1950s, but it was not until 1984 that it was approved in a national referendum. The current head of state, Adam, is dissatisfied with the slow pace of his subjects' work. He said his father once suggested implementing new tax laws, but it has been dragged on for decades with no resolution.

This rare peaceful small country recently experienced a political storm, causing the entire nation to be in an uproar. In fact, this storm originated from a small matter. The princely family owns 500 works by the 17th-century Flemish painter Rubens. If all were sold, the princely family could become world-class billionaires. However, the late Prince Joseph did not want to sell them but suggested building a museum to exhibit his collection for the people to enjoy.

Regarding the location of the museum and who should fund its construction, the 15-member parliament composed of representatives from the two parties has been in heated debate without resolution. Prince Adam had to order the dissolution of the parliament and decided to hold elections this March. Now, every evening, groups of people gather in the streets to listen to members of the Progressive Citizens' Party or the Patriotic Union attacking each other on the museum issue. This is a political fervor that Liechtenstein has never seen in 50 years.

Most Liechtensteiners have conservative thoughts and prefer to stay hidden in the mountains, isolated from the world. However, Prince Adam's thoughts are more open, wanting to persuade his subjects to agree to Liechtenstein joining the United Nations. He said that through the United Nations, the country's sovereignty and interests would be better guaranteed, and the international community would no longer mistakenly think that Liechtenstein is a haven for tax evaders and other criminals. However, this opinion has not received widespread support from the people, who believe that joining the United Nations is too expensive and will drag their country into international disputes. Although Prince Adam expressed his willingness to donate part of the required funds, it is still difficult to change the stubborn attitude of the people. Therefore, this national affair, which is even bigger than the museum construction issue, is moving at a snail's pace and it is unknown when it will be resolved.

　　小国“大”风波
    陈封
    在瑞士和奥地利之间的阿尔卑斯山区，有个风景如画的富裕小公国，叫列支敦士登。全国土地面积仅１６０平方公里，人口２．７万，人均收入是欧洲各国中最高的，没有失业者。５０年来，列支敦士登一直由两党联合执政，实行永久的中立政策，与世无争，国内承平，犹如一块人间乐土。
    前国家元首佛朗西斯·约瑟夫亲王１９３８年登基，直到１９８４年才让位于其子阿达姆。约瑟夫亲王在５０年代就主张妇女有参政权，但迟至１９８４年才在全民投票中被通过。现任国家元首阿达姆就对他的臣民慢节奏的办事作风不满，他说他父亲曾建议实行新税律，拖了几十年至今仍无下文。
    这个世间稀有的宁静小国最近竟发生了一次政治风波，闹得举国喧腾。实际上，这场风波起因于一件小事。亲王家族藏有５００幅１７世纪法兰德斯画家鲁宾斯的作品，如果全部出售，可使亲王家族成为世界级豪富。但是老约瑟夫亲王不愿出售，而建议建造一个博物馆，展出他的收藏，让人民共赏。
    关于博物馆的地址选在何处和由谁出钱修建，在两党代表组成的１５人议会里，迄今争论不休，无法解决。阿达姆亲王只好下令解散国会，决定今年３月举行大选。现在每天晚上街头总聚集着一群群的人聆听进步柏格党或祖国同盟党员在博物馆问题上互相攻击对方的激烈言论。这是列支敦士登公国５０年来从未有过的政治热潮。
    大多数列支敦士登人的思想都比较保守，愿意深藏在群山之中，与世隔绝。但是阿达姆亲王的思想却较开放，想要说服他的臣民同意列支敦士登加入联合国。他说通过联合国组织，国家的主权和利益更能得到保障，也可使国际社会不再误认为列支敦士登是逃税者和其他犯罪分子的避难所。可是这一意见并未受到人民的广泛支持，理由是加入联合国太费钱，还会使他们的国家卷入国际纷争之中。虽然阿达姆亲王表示愿意捐献一部分所需的费用，但也难以改变民众的顽固态度。所以，这个比建造博物馆问题更大的国家大事，按蜗牛爬行的速度，还不知要拖到哪年才能解决。
