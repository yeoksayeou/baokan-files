Thirteen leading beer breweries, including Qingdao Beer Factory, Beijing Beer Factory, and Guangzhou Beer Factory, recently jointly wrote to the Ministry of Light Industry, publicly declaring their refusal to participate in the "National Top Ten Beers" selection event organized by the Beijing Municipal Alcohol Product Quality Supervision and Inspection Station and other units.

The *Economic Reference* on March 29 revealed the content of the joint letter titled "Please Understand the Difficulties of Enterprises." The letter stated: "In recent years, various beer evaluation activities have proliferated in society. Many units unrelated to beer production and quality improvement have also taken the lead in organizing beer evaluations and seeking sponsorship from breweries." This "evaluation trend" has imposed a heavy burden on enterprises. If they do not participate, they fear offending someone and worry about future production difficulties.

The joint letter appeals to relevant leading departments and all sectors of society to understand the difficulties faced by enterprises and to focus more on organizing production, improving efficiency, and enhancing product quality.

　　十三家名优啤酒厂联名上书        
    拒绝参加十佳啤酒评选
    本报讯  青岛啤酒厂、北京啤酒厂、广州啤酒厂等１３家名优啤酒厂近日联名上书轻工部，公开表示不参加由北京市酿酒产品质量监督检验站等单位联合举办的“全国十佳啤酒”评选活动。
    《经济参考》２９日披露了这封题为《请理解企业的难处》的联名信，信中写道：“近年来，社会上各种评酒活动泛滥，一些与酒类生产无关、与提高产品质量无关的单位，也纷纷牵头组织评酒、拉厂家赞助。”这股“评酒风”给企业带来沉重的负担。若不参加，又怕得罪什么人，担心今后生产会遇到麻烦。
    联名信呼吁有关领导部门和社会各界理解企业的难处，多从组织生产、提高效益和提高产品质量上关心企业。
