    Zhejiang Implements Forest Fire Insurance
    According to Xinhua News Agency in Hangzhou on March 1st, Zhejiang Province currently has 1.55 million acres of forest under fire insurance. The new insurance product launched by the provincial insurance company has been welcomed by local residents, forestry departments, and the government.

    This forest fire insurance adopts a premium pooling method, where farmers and county, township governments share the premiums in a certain ratio, and insurance is purchased and compensated uniformly. The premium income and compensation payments are also shared by the insurance company and the township government in a certain ratio, with "shared benefits and shared risks." The insurance regulations stipulate that insurance compensation can only be used for afforestation. For those without compensation, 20% of the previous year's premium is returned as fire prevention facilities fee when renewing the insurance, to promote the benign cycle of forestry production.

    浙江实行森林火灾保险
    据新华社杭州三月一日电（记者林楠）浙江省目前已有一百五十五万亩森林实行了火灾保险。省保险公司推出的这一新险种受到当地群众、林业部门和政府的欢迎。
    这一森林火灾保险，实行的是保费统筹办法，即由林农与县、乡镇政府按比例分担保费，统一投保，统一付赔。保费收入和赔款支出也由保险公司和乡镇政府按比例“有利共享，风险共担”。保险条例规定，保险赔款只能用于造林，无赔款的在续保时返还上年保费的百分之二十作为防火设施费用，以促进林业生产的良性循环。
