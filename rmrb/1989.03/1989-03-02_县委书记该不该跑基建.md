Title: Should County Party Secretaries Run Construction Projects?

Recently, reporters conducted a survey in 12 counties in Hebei Province and found that all county party secretaries had been involved in construction projects, although the frequency varied. Some county party secretaries, after successfully completing a project, personally took on the role of chief engineer, continuing to secure materials, funds, and even sales channels.

Following the lead from above, some township party secretaries also turned township enterprises into "township party committee enterprises."

Should party secretaries run construction projects? Some say no, arguing that it is not conducive to the separation of party and government functions, not conducive to controlling the ever-expanding scale of construction projects, and not conducive to building a clean government.

However, some county party secretaries believe that not running construction projects is not an option. In an era when the party's work focus has shifted to the economy, higher authorities often use economic growth rates as the primary criterion for evaluating the performance of county party secretaries. The most effective way to increase production and profits is to launch new, large-scale projects.

They say that in a time when the commodity economy is not yet fully developed and the "official hierarchy" still holds significant influence, the success rate of securing projects is often related to one's position. For example, in a county in the Shijiazhuang region, a small power plant was to be built. The county government and the economic commission sent people to purchase equipment from a certain place, but the price was consistently quoted at 1.5 million yuan. Later, when the county party secretary got involved, the responsible person from the other side said, "Wow, you really value us, even the secretary came!" Thus, the price was halved.

### 县委书记该不该跑基建

    县委书记该不该跑基建●一说弊端甚多　●一说不跑不行
    记者最近对河北省12个县进行了调查，发现所有的县委书记都跑过基建项目，只是次数多少不同。有的县委书记在项目跑成之后，还亲自兼任工程总指挥，继续跑原料、跑材料、跑资金，甚至跑销路。
    上行下效。一些乡的党委书记也把乡镇企业办成了“乡党委企业”。
    书记跑基建，到底该不该？有人说不该，因为不利于党政分工，不利于压缩一再膨胀的基建规模，不利于廉政建设。
    但是，一些县委书记认为不跑基建不行。在全党把工作重点转移到经济上来的今天，上级往往把经济增长幅度作为考核县委书记工作好坏的主要标准。而增加产值、利润的最有效途径，莫过于新上较大的项目。
    他们说，在商品经济还不很发达、“官本位”有着强大市场的今天，跑项目的成功率还常常与职务的高低有关。石家庄地区某县要建一座小电厂，县政府、经委几次派人去某地购买设备，对方一直要价150万元。后来，县委书记出面了，对方的负责人说：“啊哟，你们真重视我们，连书记都来了！”于是，价格降了一半。
