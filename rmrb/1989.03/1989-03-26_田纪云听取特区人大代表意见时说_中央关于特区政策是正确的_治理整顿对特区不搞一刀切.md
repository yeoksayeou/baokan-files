	田纪云 Listens to Special Zone People's Congress Representatives' Opinions, Says Central Policies on Special Zones Are Correct, and Special Zones Will Not Be Treated with a One-Size-Fits-All Approach During Rectification and Adjustment

	BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) — How should special zones be handled during the rectification and adjustment? Vice Premier Tian Jiyun's response is: invite them in, go out, nurture with imports, both ends abroad, and manage "three-resource" enterprises well.

	Tian Jiyun this morning participated in the discussion of the Guangdong People's Congress delegation's special zone sub-group, after listening to the opinions of Shenzhen Mayor Li Huo, Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda, and others, said that the practice of the past 10 years has proven that the central government's decision to establish economic special zones is correct. Without special zones, without the coastal development strategy, opening up to the outside world would be an empty talk. If during the rectification and adjustment, special zones are also treated with a one-size-fits-all approach, the efforts of 10 years of opening up will be in vain.

	Tian Jiyun said that while achievements have been made, there are also phenomena of economic "overheating," which also need rectification and adjustment. In the future, the focus of work should be on rectification and adjustment while insisting on implementing the coastal development strategy.

	Tian Jiyun said that in the next two years, it is a period of major adjustments in the international economic structure, industrial structure, and investment direction. This opportunity is fleeting and rare. He hopes that the three special zones will make use of the current central policies and favorable international opportunities, not only inviting foreign investors in but also setting up factories abroad, developing projects with funds, energy, raw materials, and products all facing abroad, and managing the existing "three-resource" enterprises well, to push the special zone economy to a new level.

　　田纪云听取特区人大代表意见时说        
    中央关于特区政策是正确的        
    治理整顿对特区不搞一刀切
    本报北京３月２５日讯  中新社记者张许、本报记者王行增报道：在治理整顿中，特区怎么办？田纪云副总理的回答是：请进来，走出去，以进养出，两头在外，办好“三资企业”。
    田纪云今天上午参加人大广东代表团特区小组的讨论时，听取了深圳市长李灏、珠海市长梁广大等人的意见之后说，１０年来的实践证明，当初中央决定兴办经济特区的决定是正确的。不办特区，不搞沿海发展战略，对外开放也是一句空话。如果在治理整顿中，对特区也实行“一刀切”，１０年开放的努力就会付诸东流。
    田纪云说，在取得成绩的同时，也存在着经济“过热”现象，也需要治理整顿，今后工作的重点应该是在治理整顿的同时坚持贯彻沿海发展战略。
    田纪云说，今后两年，正是国际上经济结构、产业结构和投资方向大调整的时期，这个机会稍纵即逝，千载难逢。他希望３个特区利用中央现有政策和国际上的有利机遇，不仅请外商进来投资，还可以到国外办厂，发展资金、能源、原材料和产品都面向海外的“两头在外”项目，办好现有的“三资”企业，把特区经济推向一个新的台阶。
