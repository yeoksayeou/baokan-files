Senior analysts are gathering in Washington to draft a U.S. defense policy report, which is expected to be completed by April 21. It is said that this report will have a significant impact on how the United States interacts with the Soviet Union and other countries in the future.

This policy report was ordered by President Bush. The experts involved in drafting the report include some who have been drawn from various American "think tanks," while others are experienced individuals from the Pentagon, the State Department, and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.

It is revealed that the policy report consists of four parts: a comprehensive review of the current U.S. defense capabilities; policies needed for the 1990s; whether changes are needed in conventional and nuclear forces; and arms control policies.

Some observers believe that the Bush administration currently faces several major decisions: whether to produce the "dwarf" missile with a single warhead mounted on a truck or the giant MX missile with 10 warheads launched from railcars? How much effort is being made to achieve the space-based anti-missile plan? When will the U.S.-Soviet Geneva arms control talks resume? Some people also complain that the Bush administration's "policy formation is slow," and the drafting of the policy report is "dragging on."

    美防务政策报告即将形成
    本报讯  据外电报道，布什政府的分析家们正忙于起草一份美国防务政策报告，并定于４月２１日完成。据称，该报告必将对未来美国如何同苏联和其他国家打交道产生很大的影响。
    这份政策报告是布什总统下令起草的。起草这份报告的专家中，一些人是从美国各“思想库”抽调出来的，其他人则为来自五角大楼、国务院和军备控制和裁军署的经验丰富者。
    据透露，这份政策报告由四个部分组成：全面检查美国现有的国防力量；９０年代所需要的政策；常规力量和核力量是否需要有变化；军备控制政策。
    一些观察家认为，眼下布什政府面临这样几项重大抉择：是生产放在卡车上的单弹头“侏儒”式导弹还是生产１０个弹头的从铁道车辆上发射的巨型ＭＸ导弹？想要实现以太空为基地的反导弹计划的努力有多大？何时恢复美苏日内瓦军备控制谈判？有人还抱怨布什政府“政策的形成缓慢”，政策报告的起草“拖拉不前”。
