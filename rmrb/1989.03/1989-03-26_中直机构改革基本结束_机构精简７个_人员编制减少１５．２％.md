Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 25th.

The reform of the organizational structure and personnel allocation of the institutions and public service units directly affiliated with the Communist Party of China Central Committee has basically been completed.

Since the Central Committee's Political Bureau approved the reform plan for the central directly affiliated institutions, the Secretariat of the Central Committee has studied and formulated the "Implementation Plan for the Reform of the Central Directly Affiliated Institutions" and organized its implementation.

Over the past year, various departments of the Central Committee have, in accordance with the principles of separating party and government functions and streamlining and improving efficiency, divided the original functions and transferred the functions that should be exercised by government departments to the relevant government departments. At the same time, they have strengthened the functions of guiding the party's own construction, conducting investigations and research, and providing suggestions for the formulation of central policies. Various departments of the Central Committee have also adjusted and streamlined their internal organizations in accordance with the requirements of transforming functions.

After the reform, the structure of the institutions and public service units directly affiliated with the Central Committee has become more rational and can basically meet the needs of the Central Committee's work. The number of directly affiliated institutions with actual work has been reduced from 24 to 17, the personnel allocation of directly affiliated working departments has been reduced by 19.5%, and the personnel allocation of directly affiliated public service units has been reduced by 9.9%. Compared with the situation before the reform, the total personnel allocation has been reduced by 15.2%.

　　中直机构改革基本结束        
    机构精简７个人员编制减少１５．２％
    新华社北京３月２５日电中共中央直属工作机构和事业单位的调整和定机构、定职能、定人员编制的工作基本结束。
    自中共中央政治局原则批准中央直属机构改革方案以来，中共中央书记处研究制定了《党中央直属机构改革实施方案》并组织了实施。
    一年多来，中央各部门按照党政分开要求和精简、效能原则，对原有职能进行分解，将过去承担的应由政府部门行使的职能移交给了政府有关部门。同时，加强了指导党的自身建设、调查研究及为中央制定方针政策提出建议的职能。中央各部门还按照转变职能的要求，调整和精简了内部机构。
    机构改革后，党中央的直属机构和事业单位的结构趋于合理，基本上能够适应党中央工作的需要。有工作实体的直属机构由改革前的２４个精简为１７个，直属工作部门人员编制减少１９．５％，直属事业单位人员编制减少９．９％，与改革前相比，人员编制共减少１５．２％。
