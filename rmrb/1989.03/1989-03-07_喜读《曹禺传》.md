In the field of Chinese drama literature, research on writers and their works has primarily focused on Cao Yu and Xia Yan, with more attention given to Cao Yu. However, there is a noticeable lack of in-depth studies on the creator himself—the author. As a playwright who has influenced several generations, Cao Yu has left behind many mysteries. For example, in 1933, when Cao Yu was only 23 years old, he wrote "Thunderstorm." How could a 23-year-old, with limited life experience, produce a work with such complex structure, rich content, tight plot, and intricate characters? Additionally, why did Cao Yu, in his twenties and thirties, create classic works like "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," "Wild Fields," and "Peking Man," but after the founding of the nation (or after the victory of the War of Resistance), his plays did not match his maturity in quality?

Recently, I read "The Biography of Cao Yu" by Tian Benxiang, and it was incredibly satisfying. The most significant aspect of this biography is that it explores Cao Yu's life trajectory, unveiling the secrets behind his achievements, and revealing his inner world through his life story and experiences.

"The Biography of Cao Yu" is a scholarly work, and this is what determines the book's character and basic appearance.

In general biographies, the content about the subject's youth does not take up much space. However, "The Biography of Cao Yu" breaks this convention, dedicating over 100,000 words to Cao Yu's youth, which is about one-third of the entire book. In these 100,000 words, the author meticulously describes how Cao Yu's family planted the seeds of his anguish—his father and brother's influence. Then, the author patiently introduces the cultural background of Cao Yu's growth—his exposure to classical Chinese literature and the May Fourth New Culture, as well as his fascination with traditional Chinese opera and modern theater.

At first glance, one might wonder why so much space is dedicated to Cao Yu's youth, written in such detail. However, when one reads about why Cao Yu wrote "Thunderstorm" and how he wrote it, one realizes the author's intention. It is not about recording every detail or adding unnecessary branches; rather, it is about systematically and comprehensively providing the factors that shaped the creator—Cao Yu the writer. His personality, cultural awareness, aesthetic taste, and dramatic origins are all covered. After laying this groundwork, the author naturally describes how Cao Yu wrote "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," "Wild Fields," and even the seeds of plays like "Peking Man" and "Family," waiting for the right external conditions to mature.

The author subtly lets us understand Cao Yu through the narration of his family history and the arrangement of his experiences.

I believe that the parts of this biography that describe how Cao Yu created plays like "Thunderstorm," "Sunrise," "Wild Fields," "Peking Man," and "Family" are the most vivid, most interesting, and most beneficial sections.

Taking "Thunderstorm" as an example, the initial inspiration for writing it came from a friend and his sister-in-law's love affair. This sister-in-law became the prototype for Si Si. The other seven characters in the play also have prototypes, all of whom Cao Yu was very familiar with. As he wrote the biographies of these characters, he gradually incorporated elements from other people, and in structuring the plot, he made them typical, finally creating eight vivid characters that have been performed for over 50 years.

One of the great features of "The Biography of Cao Yu" is its combination of academic and literary value. It reveals the secrets of the creator, giving it academic value as mentioned above; its literary value is shown in: first, the vivid and lifelike description of Cao Yu's personality, especially his anguish and sense of crisis, his state of obsession during the creative process, all of which are written with great artistic flair. Second, the book's structure is well-balanced, with the main narrative being the biographer's account, interspersed with the subject's memories and materials obtained from interviews with informed individuals, making the reading experience engaging and colorful. Third, the writing is elegant, with the author's passion and talent evident in every line, making this biography highly readable and infectious.

### 喜读《曹禺传》

　　喜读《曹禺传》
    许国荣
    在中国话剧文学领域里，作家作品的研究热点，相对集中在曹禺和夏衍二位身上，其中研究曹禺的尤其多。稍感不足的是，时下学者研究曹禺作品的多，对作家——创作主体进行深入研究的极少。而作为影响过几代人的剧作家曹禺，又确实给人留存着众多难以说清的疑窦。比方说，１９３３年写《雷雨》时曹禺才２３岁。而《雷雨》结构之繁复，内涵之丰富，情节之紧凑，人物性格之复杂，何以能出自涉世未深的２３岁青年之手？还有，为什么二三十岁年纪，曹禺写出了《雷雨》、《日出》、《原野》、《北京人》这些经典作品，而建国之后（或抗战胜利之后）写的剧本质量却不能和作家的成熟同步？
    近读田本相著《曹禺传》，大有解饥解渴之感。十分重要的一点是，这本传探究了曹禺的人生轨迹，揭开了曹禺取得成就的奥秘，在身世、经历的叙述中，为我们展示了曹禺的内心世界。
    《曹禺传》是学者的制作。正是这一点决定了这本书的品格和基本面貌。
    在一般传记里，传主青少年时期的内容不占太多篇幅，《曹禺传》一反常规，青少年时期，即《雷雨》写作前用了１０多万字，占全书字数１／３弱。在这１０多万字里，作者详尽地写了家庭为曹禺种下苦闷的种子——父、兄的影响……接着又不厌其烦地介绍曹禺成长的文化背景——中国古典文学、“五四”新文化对他的薰陶，戏曲和文明戏和他系上情结……
    在初读时刻，也许会纳闷：何以青少年事要费这多笔墨，写得这样详尽？待看到曹禺为什么要写《雷雨》，是怎样写《雷雨》时，才发现作者的用心。既非有闻必录，也非旁添枝节，他是系统地、多方面地提供形成创作主体——作家曹禺的“这一个”的因素，他的性格，他的文化意识，他的审美情趣，他的戏剧渊源。待写够了这一些，加上曹禺内心的苦闷，情感的躁动，戏剧手段的娴熟，于是水到渠成，顺理成章地去描述怎样写《雷雨》、《日出》、《原野》，甚至连《北京人》、《家》这些剧本的种子都埋好，只等外部条件的成熟了。
    作者就是这样在叙述家史、铺排经历中悄悄地让我们了解了曹禺。
    我以为，这本传里写《雷雨》、《日出》、《原野》、《北京人》、《家》这些剧本如何创作出来的这些笔墨，是最最生动、最让人感兴趣，也最叫人受益的部分。
    以《雷雨》为例，最早萌发写《雷雨》的，是曹禺一位好朋友和嫂嫂的恋情。这位嫂嫂成为蘩漪的原型。这个戏里的其他七个人物也都有原型，都是曹禺熟悉不过的。在写人物小传时渐渐揉进了另外一些人的因素，再在结构剧情时加以典型化，终于出现了活生生的、被人演了５０多年的八个人物。
    《曹禺传》的一大特色是兼具学术性和文学性。揭示了创作主体的奥秘，使它具备学术价值如上述；它的文学价值则表现在：第一，对曹禺性格的描写相当生动传神，特别是他的苦闷和忧患意识，他在创作进程中的痴迷境界，都写得极富神韵。第二，全书布局疏密有致，行文以作传人的叙述为主，不时插入传主的回忆及访问知情人得来的材料，三者交叉行进，不显枯燥，反添色彩。第三，文采斐然，处处感受得到作者横溢在字里行间的热情，流淌在学术见解里的才情。这些特点，使这本《曹禺传》具有可读性和感染力。
