On the afternoon of January 15, heart-wrenching cries echoed from the home of Xian Jialin in Wujia Village, Huashan Township, Baojing County, Hunan Province. Eight carpenters were hurriedly making a coffin for the deceased Xian Jialin, who had mistakenly consumed poisoned food prepared by his daughter, Xian Xinfu.

Xian Jialin, a 56-year-old villager, has a 24-year-old daughter named Xian Xinfu. Xian Xinfu married Yang Changming, a young man from Tianchong Village, Baojing County, in October 1985. They have two children. Since last winter, Xian Xinfu claimed that her marital relationship was strained and demanded a divorce, but she couldn't provide any valid reasons. She intended to poison her husband to facilitate the divorce. On January 14, she mixed methyl parathion into a dish of spicy tofu. Xian Xinfu's original intention was to poison her husband, but unfortunately, her father mistakenly consumed the poisoned food.

Currently, the criminal Xian Xinfu has been arrested and is in prison. The case is under investigation.
