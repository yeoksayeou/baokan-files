This year marks the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. As France prepares for grand celebrations, the publishing industry is also joining in, with an estimated 200 books on the French Revolution expected to be published by the end of the year. However, contrary to the celebratory mood, a new trend has emerged in French intellectual and historical circles, re-evaluating the merits and demerits of the revolution. This is exemplified by the work of François Furet and Mona Ozouf, "Critical Dictionary of the French Revolution," which has caused quite a stir. This is indeed surprising, as the French Revolution's place in French and world history has long been established and is considered a settled matter, not subject to revision.

However, a trendy new school of thought in the historical field likes to re-evaluate historical events that have already been judged, even overturning previously established conclusions. This is somewhat reminiscent of Guo Moruo's attempt to rehabilitate Cao Cao's image, although the analogy is not entirely accurate, as Guo Moruo was challenging Cao Cao's negative image in folklore, not his historical role. This school of thought has a specific term in the historical field. If translated literally as "revisionism," it can be called the "revisionist school," but it is more straightforward to refer to it as the "rewriting school" or the "reinterpretation school."

In fact, over the past 200 years, there have been debates about the French Revolution, but the view that affirmed the necessity of the revolution ultimately prevailed. If the earlier debates were about the necessity of the revolution, the current debates focus on whether the use of terror to consolidate the revolution was necessary. In other words, the debate is not about the goals of the revolution but about the means of the revolution.

In fact, the debate about the means of the revolution is not new. Any history textbook points out that during the Reign of Terror, countless people were killed, and the number of innocent victims on the guillotine is unknown (according to Jean-François Fayet in "Revolutionary Justice: Chronicles of Terror," between 1792 and 1795, 17,000 people were executed). To the point where Madame Roland, as she was about to be executed, lamented, "Ah, freedom, how many crimes are committed in thy name!" And after Robespierre sent many of his opponents to the guillotine, he himself eventually met the same fate, which is undoubtedly a historical tragedy.

But the greatest tragedy lies in the fact that the goals of the revolution, as proclaimed in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, were to uphold freedom and equality, these basic human rights, while the means to defend the revolution were the terror that suppressed and trampled these basic human rights, which is an ironic twist. However, for 200 years, the prevailing argument in the debates has been that due to the rampant counter-revolution, the Reign of Terror was completely necessary to protect the fruits of the revolution, and the innocent victims could only be seen as sacrifices on the path of historical progress.

The new arguments challenging this justification are: considering the high number of sacrifices (according to René Sédillot in "The Cost of the French Revolution," approximately 2 million people died due to revolutionary violence), the cost is too high. This does not include the long-term internal strife and conflicts within the French nation that lasted for 100 years, until the fall of Napoleon III, when France was finally able to establish a republican system guided by the ideals of the original revolution. Moreover, the most harmful legacy is that the terror tactics of the French Revolution and their justifications planted the seeds for other countries to follow suit with mass arrests and killings, and this serious and tragic consequence is not limited to France alone.

### 法国大革命功过新论

　　法国大革命功过新论
    今年是法国大革命的２００周年。正当法国朝野上下在忙着准备盛大庆典的时候，出版界也来凑个热闹，预计在今年年终之前将有２００种左右有关法国大革命的书出版。但是与整个庆典调子不调和的是，法国思想界和史学界忽然冒出了一股重新估价大革命的功过是非的思潮，其中以法朗索瓦·富勒特和蒙娜·奥佐夫合编的《法国大革命评论辞典》为代表，颇引起一些轰动。这不能不说是一件令人意想不到的事。因为大革命在法国历史上乃至世界历史上的地位早已有定评，并且已经写进历史教科书中，应该说是无可争议，不容翻案的。
    但是如今国外史学界流行一种时髦的新学派，对于历史上早已有定评的事件喜欢来个观念更新的再认识，甚至把原来已有的结论来个彻底的推翻，颇有点当年郭沫若为曹操翻案的味道。虽然这个比喻不尽恰当，因为郭沫若翻的是曹操在民间传说中的反面形象的案，而不是他在历史上正面作用的案。这一学派在史学界有个专门名词，若按“修正主义”一词的定译，可以叫“修正学派”，但这总不如称为“改写学派”或“翻案学派”来得干脆。
    其实，在这次对法国大革命作重新估计之前，２００年来对于法国大革命的认识不是没有争议的，但终以后来流行的肯定革命的必要性一派占上风而告终。如果说当初的争议是关于革命的必要性的话，这次的争议则是关于为巩固革命而采取恐怖手段是否有必要的争议，也就是说不是关于革命的目的的争议，而是关于革命的手段的争议。
    其实，再来一个关于革命的手段的争议，也不是从今日始。在任何历史教科书中都曾指出过，在恐怖统治期间，杀人无数，断头台上的枉死者不知有多少（据让—法朗索瓦·法耶德在《革命的正义：恐怖纪事》一文中估计，在１７９２年到１７９５年之间，断头台上送命者有１．７万人），以致罗兰夫人在上断头台时有“啊！自由，多少罪行假汝之名以行”之叹，而罗伯斯庇尔在把许多对手送上断头台上之后，最终自己也落到一个上断头台的下场，这不能不说是一场历史的悲剧。
    但最大的悲剧还在于当初人权宣言中所标榜的革命目标是为了维护自由和平等这些基本人权，而为了保卫革命所采取的手段竟是扼杀和践踏这些基本人权的恐怖统治，这又无异是个莫大的讽刺。但是２００年来在争议中占上风的始终是这样的辩解：由于反革命的猖狂，为了维护革命的成果，恐怖统治是完全必要的，枉死者也只好作为历史前进途上的牺牲品而自认晦气了。
    如今对这种辩解提出质疑的新论点是：考虑到牺牲人数之多（据雷内·塞迪洛特在《法国大革命的代价》一文中的估计，因革命的暴力而丧生的约有２００万人），这个代价未免太大了。这还不算因此而造成的法兰西民族的长期内讧和冲突达１００年之久，直到后来拿破仑三世垮台，法国才得以建立以当初大革命的理想为指导原则的共和政体。而尤其贻害无穷的是，法国大革命的恐怖手段及其辩解播下了日后其他国家其他革命按此效法实行错捕滥杀的种子，这个严重的悲惨后果就不限于法国一国了。
