Theft and robbery have been rampant along the Gui-Kun railway in the Huala area. Since September of last year, stations such as Xin Yao, Huala, and Guan Le on the Gui-Kun railway have frequently experienced thefts of railway transportation materials, resulting in a loss of over 150,000 yuan in state property.

The Liuzhi Railway Public Security Bureau reported that the criminals involved in stealing railway transportation materials are mostly local farmers. These individuals hide near the stations during the day and, after dark, board the stopped freight trains to steal without restraint. They steal a wide range of items, from large appliances like refrigerators, televisions, and washing machines to smaller items such as shoes, socks, and medicines—whatever they can get their hands on. On December 4th of last year, 25 boxes of Cha Hua brand cigarettes, valued at over 56,000 yuan, were stolen from the 825th freight train while it was stopped at the Huala railway station. By the end of last year, more than 10 such thefts had occurred along the 70-kilometer railway line within the Liuzhi Special Economic Zone. Additionally, similar thefts of railway transportation materials have been reported at other stations along this railway line, such as Shuicheng East, Lanba, Shuangshui, and Yema Zhai.

Theft and robbery of railway transportation materials along the Gui-Kun railway have been a long-standing issue. It is hoped that relevant local authorities will cooperate and strengthen legal and protective education efforts to jointly maintain railway security.

### 贵昆线花赖一带盗贼猖獗

　　贵昆线花赖一带盗贼猖獗
    去年９月以来，贵昆线上的新窑、花赖、关寨等火车站经常发生盗窃铁路运输物资案件，国家财产损失达１５万多元。
    六枝铁路公安派出所反映，盗窃铁路运输物资的不法分子多是当地农民。这些人白天隐藏在车站附近，天黑后货车到站停靠时，便肆无忌惮地上车盗窃。他们盗窃的物品，大到冰箱、彩电、洗衣机；小到皮鞋、袜子、药品，见啥偷啥。去年１２月４日，８２５次货车在花赖火车站停靠时，茶花牌香烟被盗２５箱，价值５６０００多元。截至去年底，仅六枝特区境内７０多公里的铁道线上，就发生盗窃铁路物资案件１０多起。此外，这条铁路线上的水城东站、滥坝、双水、野马寨等地，盗窃铁路运输物资的现象也时有发生。
    贵昆线上，铁路运输物资被盗窃哄抢由来已久。希望地方有关部门大力配合，加强法制和爱路护路教育，共同维护铁路治安。
