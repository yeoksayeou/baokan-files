	State Council Teleconference Mobilizes All Regions to Prioritize Agriculture and Ensure Agricultural Resource Supply

	BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) — The State Council held a nationwide teleconference today, urging all regions to mobilize immediately to ensure the supply of agricultural production resources.

	Vice Premier Chen Junsheng presided over the meeting. He emphasized that in the current production arrangements, everything must give way to agriculture. This is the big picture. Because first, we need to eat, and second, agriculture is seasonal.

	Vice Minister of the State Planning Commission and Deputy Director of the State Council's Leading Group for Agricultural Production Resources Coordination, Ye Qing, said that the current supply of agricultural resources is still tight. In terms of varieties, agricultural film is better than fertilizer, fertilizer is better than pesticides, and the supply-demand contradiction for pesticides is particularly prominent. The production rate of small fertilizer plants is insufficient.

	According to the requirements of the State Council leaders for "increasing quantity, timely supply, stable prices, and comprehensive services," the meeting required all regions to firmly grasp the specialized operations of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films this year, and to make good use of the funds recently invested by the People's Bank of China in pesticides, fertilizers, agricultural films, seeds, and agricultural machinery. In response to the situation where pesticides have been in short supply for several consecutive years, the State Council requires that pesticide production be taken as a key point for agricultural production resources this year.

　　国务院电话会议动员各地
    安排生产先保农业  农资供应务须落实
    本报北京３月１６日讯  记者高保生报道：国务院今天召开全国电话会议，要求各地紧急动员起来，落实农业生产资料的供应。
    国务委员陈俊生主持了今天的会议。他强调，在当前生产安排上，一切要为农业让路，这是大局。因为一是要吃饭，二是农业季节性强。
    国家计委副主任、国务院农业生产资料协调领导小组组长叶青说，当前农资供应仍然偏紧，从品种看，农膜好于化肥，化肥好于农药，农药供需矛盾比较突出。小化肥生产开工率不足。
    根据国务院领导提出的“数量增加，供应及时，价格平稳，服务周到”的要求，会议要求各地在今年的农资供应中，坚定不移地抓好化肥、农药、农膜专营工作，用好人民银行最近投于农药、化肥、农膜、种子和农机的资金。针对农药连续几年欠供的情况，国务院要求把农药生产作为今年农业生产资料的重点来抓。
