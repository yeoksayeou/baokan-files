    Yang Shangkun Meets Martinez
    Both Sides Emphasize Developing Friendly Relations Between the Two Countries

    Beijing, March 30 (Xinhua) — Reporter Ding Gang: State Chairman Yang Shangkun met with Argentine Vice President Victor Martinez this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People.

    Yang said, "China and Argentina have many common points on many issues, and bilateral cooperation has achieved results. Both sides should continue to work hard to further develop friendly relations between the two countries."

    Martinez said, "The Argentine government attaches great importance to developing relations with China. This is the consensus of all parties in Argentina and is the political basis for the development of Argentine-Chinese friendly relations."

    Yang said, "Opening up means making friends and developing together with friends. Argentina is a good partner for cooperation with China. Both sides can learn from each other and complement each other's strengths and weaknesses."

    Yang emphasized, "China attaches great importance to relations with Latin American countries and hopes that this friendly relationship can continue to deepen."

    When talking about the current international situation, Yang pointed out that there are still many problems in the development of the world economy. The rich are very rich, and the poor are very poor. Many developing countries are under the heavy burden of external debts, making it difficult to balance the development of the world economy. Therefore, China advocates the establishment of a new economic order in the world.

    Martinez believes that human-created wealth should not always fall into the hands of developed countries. The solution to this problem should be to strengthen mutual support among developing countries. China and Argentina can strengthen cooperation to promote the establishment of a new international economic order.

　　杨尚昆会见马丁内斯        
    宾主强调发展两国友好关系
    本报北京３月３０日讯  记者丁刚报道：国家主席杨尚昆今天下午在人民大会堂会见了阿根廷副总统维克托·马丁内斯。
    杨主席说，中阿两国之间在许多问题上都有共同语言，双边合作也有成绩。双方应继续努力，以使两国友好关系进一步发展。
    马丁内斯副总统说，阿根廷政府重视发展对华关系，这是阿根廷所有政党的一致意见，也是阿中友好关系发展的政治基础。
    杨主席说，讲开放就是要找朋友，同朋友们共同发展。阿根廷是一个同我国合作的好朋友，双方可以互相学习、取长补短。
    杨主席强调，中国非常重视同拉丁美洲国家的关系，希望这种友好关系能够不断深入发展。
    杨主席在谈到当前的国际形势时指出，世界经济的发展仍存在着许多问题，富的很富，穷的很穷。许多发展中国家承受着外债的重压，使世界经济的发展难以平衡。所以，中国主张在世界上建立新的经济秩序。
    马丁内斯副总统认为，不能让人类创造的财富总落在发达国家手中。解决这个问题的办法应该是加强发展中国家的相互支持。中阿两国可以加强合作，推动新的国际经济秩序的建立。
