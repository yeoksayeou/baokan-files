North-South Korea's Second Vice-Ministerial Talks Make No Progress

Our reporter Xu Baokang reports from Panmunjom: The second round of vice-ministerial talks between North and South Korea was held this morning in the "Unification Pavilion" on the North's side of Panmunjom. Due to heated arguments over the "Team Spirit '89" joint military exercises, no agreement was reached.

The head of the North's delegation, Baek Nam-jun (pictured, standing on the left in the middle), proposed three points regarding the "Team Spirit '89" joint military exercises being held in South Korea: stop the "Team Spirit '89" joint military exercises; all troops and equipment mobilized for the exercises must be immediately withdrawn; and if the South Korean military wants to conduct exercises without the participation of foreign troops, the scale must be reduced and the name changed.

The South's representatives rejected the North's demands. Both sides agreed to hold the third preparatory meeting on April 12 in Panmunjom.

　　朝鲜北南第二次副部级会谈无进展
    本报板门店３月２日电  记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜北南双方今天上午在板门店北方一侧的“统一阁”举行了第二次副部长级会谈，由于双方在“协作精神８９”联合军事演习问题上发生激烈争吵而没有达成任何协议。
    北方代表团团长白南俊（左图中左立者）在发言中对在南朝鲜举行的“协作精神８９”联合军事演习向南方提出了三点建议：停止“协作精神８９”联合军事演习；所有被动员参加演习的部队和武器装备必须立即撤出演习；南朝鲜军队在没有外国军队参加的情况下要演习也必须缩小规模并更名。
    南方代表拒绝了北方的要求。双方商定４月１２日在板门店举行第三次预备会谈。
