    China has over 400 open ports. Last year's import and export transportation volume reached over 180 million tons.

    According to the vice-chairman of the State Council's Port Management Committee, Shi Xiyu, China currently has 126 first-class ports, 287 second-class ports, totaling 413 ports. Sea, land, and air import and export transportation are unprecedentedly busy.

    Last year, China's port construction and management saw significant breakthroughs. Several ports and airports completed expansion and renovation projects. The state approved the opening of eight ports, including Shidao Port, Qingdao Liuting Airport, and Zhengzhou Airport. Additionally, several ports are awaiting approval for opening. Last year, the total import and export transportation volume at various ports reached over 180 million tons, exceeding the annual plan by 13.8%, setting a historical record. The number of people checked for entry and exit reached 68.83 million, the highest in a decade. Various ports also received 893,000 Taiwanese compatriots, an increase of tenfold compared to the previous year.

    China's port work still faces challenges. First, there is a significant disparity between railway transport capacity and volume. Coupled with the rapid development of regional trade between China and the Soviet Union and border trade, measures have not kept up, leading to severe overloading and cargo congestion. Second, ports like Dalian and Qinhuangdao have delays in exporting goods, resulting in a large number of ships waiting to be loaded, causing adverse effects.

　　我开放口岸逾四百个
    去年进出口运输量达一亿八千多万吨
    本报北京３月１１日讯  记者陆振华报道：国务院口岸领导小组副组长石希玉透露，我国已有一类口岸１２６个，二类口岸２８７个，总数达到４１３个，海、陆、空进出口运输空前繁忙。
    去年我国口岸建设和管理有重要突破，一批港口、机场扩建改造竣工，国家相继批准开放了石岛港、青岛流亭机场、郑州机场等８个口岸，还有一批口岸正待批准开放。去年各口岸完成进出口运输量达１．８亿多吨，超过年计划的１３．８％，创造了历史最高纪录。全年检查入出境人员６８８３万人次，是１０年来最多的一年，各口岸还接待了入境台湾同胞８９．３万人次，比上年增加１０倍。
    我国口岸工作仍喜中有忧，一是铁路运力和运量矛盾突出，外加中苏间地区贸易和边境贸易发展迅速，措施没有及时跟上，造成了一些严重压车压货现象；二是大连、秦皇岛等港出口货物集运不及时，发生大量船只待装，造成不良影响。
