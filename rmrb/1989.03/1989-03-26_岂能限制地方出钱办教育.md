	How Can We Restrict Local Investment in Education?

	Reporter Xiang Bing

	“Every day we talk about mobilizing all aspects to actively invest in education, but we restrict local governments from spending money to build schools.” The words of National People's Congress delegate and Yuxi Municipal Committee Secretary Shuan Yuhua startled the reporter. He told the reporter that in recent years, Yuxi's financial revenue has increased year by year, and the investment in education has also increased year by year, reaching 22 million yuan in 1988. This year, they planned to invest even more to bring Yuxi's basic education to a new level. However, they did not expect that at the beginning of this year, relevant national departments, while controlling the scale of construction projects, also controlled the basic education construction that had never been within the control range, issuing a plan to reduce the scale. “Yuxi's educational construction funds for this year have been restricted to 6 million yuan, and we can only use the remaining financial resources for other things.”

	“Increasing educational funds is a call from the entire society. Now, not only has the investment in educational construction been reduced, but local governments are also not allowed to spend money on education. I really don't understand how the relevant decision-making departments are thinking?” Zhaotong Municipal Committee Deputy Secretary for Education and Culture Wu Jinzhuang told the reporter that Yunnan Province's educational investment last year was 160 million yuan. Unexpectedly, the national directive plan for this year controls Yunnan Province's investment at 120 million yuan, a reduction of 25% compared to last year.

	Speaking of this, Wu Jinzhuang couldn't help but become a bit excited: “Reducing the scale of non-production construction is an opportunity to transfer funds to the educational cause, but a directive from the decision-making department has strangled the enthusiasm of the society to invest in education. When will the decision-makers in the state organs change this one-size-fits-all approach to work!”

　　岂能限制地方出钱办教育
    本报记者  向兵
    “天天讲调动各方面积极性办教育，却又限制地方出钱盖学校。”人大代表、云南玉溪地委书记段毓华的话，让记者感到吃惊。他告诉记者，玉溪地区近几年财政收入年年增长，用在教育上的投资也年年增加，１９８８年达到了２２００万元。今年本打算再多投一些，使玉溪的基础教育上到一个新台阶。然而想不到，今年初国家有关部门在压缩基建规模时，对从不纳入控制范围的基础教育基本建设也实行控制，下达压缩性指令计划。“玉溪地区今年用在教育基建的经费被限制在６００万元内，我们剩下的财力也只好拿去干别的事了。”
    “增加教育经费，这是全社会的呼声。现在不仅压缩了对教育基建的投资，又不准地方出钱办教育，真不明白有关决策部门是怎么想的？”昭通地区分管文教的副专员吴锦庄告诉记者，云南省去年教育投资为１．６亿元。没想到国家今年下给云南省的指令性计划控制在１．２亿元内，竟比去年减少了２５％。
    说到此，吴锦庄禁不住有些激动：“压缩非生产性建设规模正是向教育事业转移资金的一个机会，而决策部门的一条指令却把社会办教育的积极性扼杀了。国家机关的一些决策人，什么时候能改一改这种一刀切的工作方法！”
