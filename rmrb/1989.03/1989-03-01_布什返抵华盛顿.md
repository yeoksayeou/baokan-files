    Bush Returns to Washington
    People's Daily, Washington, February 28th. Reporter Zhang Qixun reports: U.S. President Bush concluded his 5-day visit to Asia and returned to Andrews Air Force Base on the evening of the 27th.

    Bush spoke at the base, saying that this was a fruitful visit, which strongly demonstrates that "the United States is now, and will continue to be, a Pacific nation." It is said that Bush's first task upon returning home will be to meet with senators, aiming to persuade the Senate to confirm Tower as the Secretary of Defense.

　　布什返抵华盛顿
    本报华盛顿２月２８日电  记者张启昕报道：美国总统布什结束５天亚洲之行后，于２７日晚返抵安德鲁斯空军基地。
    布什在基地发表讲话说，这是一次富有成果的访问，它有力地表明“美国现在是，今后仍将是一个太平洋国家”。据说，布什回国后即将着手的第一件事是会见参议员们，意欲说服参议院确认托尔担任国防部长。
