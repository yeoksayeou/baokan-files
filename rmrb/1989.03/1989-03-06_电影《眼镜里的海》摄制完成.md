The filming of a color feature film "The Sea in the Glasses," written and performed by middle school students, has been completed by the Zhujiang Film Studio. The film has been screened in Guangzhou and Beijing, receiving warm welcome from middle school students and their teachers and parents.

"The Sea in the Glasses" depicts the mental state of a group of students in their final year of junior high school, and the ripples stirred in their hearts by various social currents. It reflects some flaws in the educational system and raises some thought-provoking questions. It sincerely appeals to teachers, parents, and society to give more understanding, trust, and correct guidance to middle school students who are in their "dreamy years."

Li Chunli, the screenwriter who just entered Renmin University of China last year, was originally a student of Beijing No. 31 Middle School. She was only 17 years old when she completed this script.

　　电影《眼镜里的海》摄制完成
    一部由中学生自编自演的彩色故事片《眼镜里的海》，由珠江电影制片厂摄制完成。影片在广州、北京试映受到中学生和他们的老师、家长的欢迎。
    《眼镜里的海》描写的是一群即将毕业的初中三年级学生的心态，以及社会上各种思潮折射到他们心灵所掀起的涟漪，从而透视出教育制度上的一些弊端，提出了一些令人深思的问题。它向教师、家长、社会真诚地呼唤：对处在“多梦时节”的中学生要给予更多的理解、信任和正确引导。
    去年刚进入中国人民大学学习的编剧李春利原是北京３１中的学生，完成这部剧本时刚满１７岁。
