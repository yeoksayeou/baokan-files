To address the issue of social inequality in distribution, it is necessary to gradually improve the distribution system, resolutely eliminate illegal income, and protect legal income, said Premier Li Peng at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress.

Li Peng said that the current wage system in government agencies and public institutions should continue to be reformed and gradually improved. Enterprises should implement and improve the system of linking total wages to economic performance, ensuring that the growth of workers' wages is genuinely based on increased labor productivity and economic performance.

Li Peng said that starting this year, efforts will be made to quickly establish and improve the system of declaring personal taxable income, and to further strengthen the collection of personal income adjustment taxes to regulate excessive income disparities. This work will begin in major cities, first implemented among personnel in various levels of leadership, various types of companies, and individual business owners. He said that paying taxes in accordance with the law is the obligation and responsibility of all taxable entities and individuals. It is necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and education to instill in all enterprises and citizens the legal concept of paying taxes in accordance with the law, and to resolutely combat all illegal tax evasion behaviors.

　　逐步改进分配制度        
    解决社会分配不公
    新华社北京３月２１日电  国务院总理李鹏在七届全国人大二次会议上说，为解决社会分配不公问题，必须逐步改进分配制度，坚决取缔非木法收入，保护合法收入。
    李鹏说，机关、事业单位的现行工资制度要继续进行改革，使之逐步完善。企业要推行和完善工资总额同经济效益挂钩的制度，使职工工资的增长真正建立在提高劳动生产率和经济效益的基础之上。
    李鹏说，从今年起，将尽快建立和完善个人应税收入的申报制度，进一步加强个人收入调节税的征收工作，以调节收入差距的过分悬殊。这项工作先从大城市做起，先在各级领导机关和各类公司人员以及个体工商户中开始实行。他说，依法纳税是所有应税单位和个人应尽的义务和责任，必须通过广泛深入的宣传教育使所有企业和公民都养成依法纳税的守法观念，并同一切偷税漏税的违法行为进行坚决的斗争。
