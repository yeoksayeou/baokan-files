Without coal, there would be no electricity. Without coal, other industries would also struggle to advance. The supply-demand relationship for coal has once again become tense, with serious shortages and insufficient future capacity. Issues exist with investment policies, pricing policies, and the coal mining workforce. The way forward lies in opening up multiple channels, leveraging the enthusiasm of various parties to develop mines; renovating and optimizing existing mines to enhance production capacity; addressing the coal price issue and gradually rationalizing it; and, most importantly, showing deep concern for the lives of coal miners.

Starting from last year, the situation where the coal supply-demand relationship had eased for three consecutive years has changed. Nationwide coal social inventory levels have been gradually decreasing, especially in coal-deficient regions such as East China, Northeast China, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, and Hunan, which have frequently issued emergency alerts.

According to relevant departments, this tense situation will not ease in the coming period but is likely to worsen. In the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the national coal production target for 1990 is set at 1 billion tons, an increase of only 130 million tons from the actual production in 1985, averaging an annual increase of 260 million tons. However, the combined coal demand from the power, steel, and domestic sectors alone requires an additional 376 million tons, resulting in an annual shortfall of 116 million tons. Adding other industrial coal demands, the cumulative coal shortfall during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period will be nearly 700 million tons. By the end of the century, if the total industrial and agricultural output value is planned to grow at an annual rate of 6%, the minimum demand for primary energy will be 1.47 billion tons of standard coal, making the supply-demand contradiction even more pronounced. The lack of future capacity in the coal industry will seriously affect the development of the national economy.

To alleviate the energy shortage, a crucial measure is to increase necessary investments in the coal industry. In the past two years, some people mistakenly believed that the coal issue had been resolved due to the temporary easing of the situation. This is a misconception. The construction cycle for coal mines is relatively long, typically taking around 10 years from the start of construction to production for large and medium-sized mines. Without early investment in coal mines, coal production will be difficult to secure when needed. Over the years, although the state has provided some investment in the coal industry, the investment has been insufficient, far less than that in the power industry. Without coal, how can there be electricity? The total investment for the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" construction of state-owned coal mines is 3.15 billion yuan, with 2.52 billion yuan planned for the first four years, but only 2.35 billion yuan was actually allocated, a shortfall of 170 million yuan. Under the condition of insufficient investment, only 4,992 million tons of mines were started in four years, a shortfall of 8,380 million tons; 8,991 million tons of mines were planned to be put into production in four years, a shortfall of 4,221 million tons. This will have a very serious impact on future coal production.

Solving the coal investment issue requires opening up multiple channels. Relying solely on central fiscal funds is not feasible. It is necessary to fully leverage the enthusiasm of local governments to develop mines and to effectively utilize foreign capital to develop coal mines. The raising of coal mine construction funds should gradually move away from the current complete reliance on fiscal support, where funds are allocated based on availability. The principle should be that whoever uses coal should fund the mine development.

Rationally utilizing investments and tapping the production potential of existing mines is a crucial step in increasing coal production. It must be acknowledged that some of China's key coal mines have long been overloaded while lacking investment. A batch of old mines are entering the aging and decommissioning phase. It is estimated that state-owned coal mines will decommission 4,300 million tons of capacity by the year 2000, with aging mines reducing production by 3,000 million tons, resulting in a total reduction of 7,000 million tons. In this situation, is coal production helpless? The answer is no. Just looking at the working face conditions of coal mines in China can reveal the problem. Currently, the mechanization rate of national key coal mines is only over 30%, and that of local coal mines is around 15%, meaning that in 1 billion tons of coal, the vast majority is mined manually, with low efficiency. Even for working faces that have adopted mechanization, their efficiency has not been fully utilized. If we can fully leverage the efficiency of mechanization, improve the single output and single advance of working faces, increase efficiency, and improve recovery rates, we can increase coal production by over 1,000 million tons in one year. Therefore, in the future, we should rationally utilize funds, select coal mines with abundant reserves and good conditions, strengthen management, improve the level of mechanization, carry out expansion and technological transformation, tap potential, reduce personnel and increase production, and make up for the decline in old mines.

The coal price issue is the most sensitive issue and also the most important factor affecting the development of coal production. Without solving this, the coal industry lacks the "blood transfusion" function, where can the future capacity come from? According to national industrial census data, from 1949 to 1985, the state's investment in the coal industry totaled over 75.89 billion yuan, while the recovered profits and taxes during the same period accounted for only 29.6% of the investment, which is not only far below the average recovery rate for the entire industry (207.18%), but also below the average recovery rate for the mining industry (92.13%). In recent years, although the name of basic construction investment has been changed to loans, due to the coal mines' inability to repay the principal and interest, it is essentially still a gratuitous input. Moreover, the state still has to allocate a large amount of funds to subsidize coal mine losses each year. For example, in 1987, the state allocated over 7 billion yuan (5.81 billion yuan for investment and 1.449 billion yuan for loss subsidies), which is essentially a form of dark subsidy to coal-using units and local governments through the supply of low-priced coal. Under such circumstances, coal-using industries and local governments are unwilling to invest money in developing coal mines. In the past few years, the investment by various provinces (autonomous regions) in coal mines was 959 million yuan, reduced to 715 million yuan in 1986, and 766 million yuan in 1987. If the factor of rising prices of construction materials is deducted, the actual reduction is even greater.

From the perspective of coal mines themselves, due to the low coal prices, the production costs of coal mines cannot be compensated by the selling price, and they have long relied on state subsidies to sustain themselves. Coupled with the state's financial difficulties, the "blood transfusion" to coal mines is insufficient, causing coal mines to be in a long-term predicament. From 1959 to 1988, the entire industry of state-owned coal mines had 11 years of losses. Enterprises with losses exceeding 50% had 19 years. In 1987, the loss rate reached 72.8%. The loss rate of local state-owned coal mines also reached 53%. The coal industry is related to various industries and thousands of households, and the coal price issue is a very sensitive problem. Solving this problem requires time and process, but it cannot be avoided. Only by gradually rationalizing coal prices can the coal industry develop healthily.

Stabilizing the coal mining workforce and showing deep concern for the lives of coal miners is an indispensable guarantee for increasing the future capacity of the coal industry. The working conditions of the coal industry are harsh and dangerous. Overseas, miners' wages are generally higher than those in other industries. In China, for the past 20-30 years, the average wage of the coal industry has always been at the forefront of various industries. In recent years, the situation has changed, dropping from the 4th position in 1984 to the 12th position in 1985. After the wage adjustment in 1986, it once again rose to the 3rd position, but due to the entire industry's losses, workers could not receive their due wages. In 1987, the wage level dropped to the 11th position nationwide. How can such a situation stabilize the coal mining workforce?

There are only 12 years left until the year 2000, and if the production of coal, as the main energy source, is not properly arranged and future capacity is not emphasized, it will be too late to address the issue when it is truly unsustainable.

　　煤炭工业后劲在哪里？
    本报记者  刘燮阳
    没有煤，哪有电？没有煤，其它工业也上不去。煤炭供求关系再度紧张，后劲严重不足，投资政策、价格政策，矿工队伍都存在问题，出路在于开辟多种渠道，发挥多方面积极性办矿；改造挖潜，提高现有矿井生产潜力；正视煤价问题，并且逐步理顺；同时百倍地关心矿工生活。
    从去年开始，连续３年煤炭供求关系暂时缓和的局面发生了变化，全国煤炭社会库存量逐步下降，特别是华东、东北、两广、两湖等缺煤地区，多次告急。
    据有关部门预测，这种紧张状况，在今后一个相当长的时期内不但得不到缓和，反而有加剧之势。在“七五”计划安排中，１９９０年全国煤炭产量确定为１０亿吨，比１９８５年实际产量仅增长１．３亿吨，平均每年增长２６００万吨。而电力、钢铁工业、生活用煤三项合计需增供３７６０万吨，每年缺口１１６０万吨。再加上其它行业用煤，“七五”期间累计煤炭缺口将近７０００万吨，到本世纪末，工农业总产值如按年均增长６％的速度规划，一次能源需要量最少需１４．７亿吨标准煤，供需矛盾更为突出。煤炭工业后劲不足，将会严重影响国民经济的发展。
    缓解能源紧张，重要的措施是增加对煤炭工业必要的投入。前两年，由于煤炭有了暂时的缓和，有的同志以为煤炭问题已经解决，这是一种误解。煤矿的建设周期比较长，大中型矿井从破土动工到生产一般都需要１０年左右时间，不给煤矿及早的投入，到时候想要煤是要不出来的。这些年来，国家对煤炭工业虽然给予了一些投入，但投资太少，远不如电力工业，没有煤，哪来的电？统配煤矿“七五”建设总投资３１５亿元，前４年应安排投资２５２亿元，实际安排２３５亿元，少投资１７亿元。在投资少的情况下，４年只开工矿井４９９２万吨，少开工８３８０万吨；４年预计投产矿井８９９１万吨，少投产４２２１万吨，这就给今后的煤炭生产带来极为严重的影响。
    解决煤炭的投资，要开辟多种渠道，光靠中央财政，是难以承担的。要充分发挥地方办矿的积极性，要很好利用外资发展煤矿。煤矿建设基金的筹措，应当逐步摆脱迄今为止完全依赖财政，有钱就多给，没钱就少给的状况，原则上应是谁用煤谁出钱办矿。
    合理用好投资，挖掘现有矿井的生产潜力，是提高煤炭生产的重要一环。应当承认，我国一些骨干煤矿，长期以来处于负荷过重而投资不足的状态。一批老井相继进入衰老报废期，预计统配煤矿在２０００年前要报废矿井能力４３００万吨，衰老井减产３０００万吨，衰老和报废井共减产７０００多万吨。在这种情况下，煤炭生产是不是无能为力了呢？答曰：否。只要看看我国煤矿工作面的状况就可看出问题。目前，全国统配煤矿机械化的程度只有３０％以上，地方煤矿只有１５％左右，也就是说在１０亿吨煤中，绝大部分是靠人工开采的，效率很低，即使已经采用机械化的工作面，效能也未充分发挥。如果我们很好发挥机械化的效能，提高工作面单产、单进，提高效率，提高回收率，１年就可增产上千万吨煤炭。因此，今后要合理利用资金，选择一些储量丰富、条件较好的煤矿，通过加强管理，提高机械化程度，进行扩建和技术改造，挖掘潜力，减人增产，弥补老井衰减。
    煤炭价格问题是最敏感的问题，也是影响煤炭生产发展最重要的问题。不解决，煤炭工业缺乏“输血”机能，哪里能有后劲？据全国工业普查资料，自１９４９年至１９８５年，国家对煤炭工业的投资累计达７５８．９亿多元，同期回收的利税仅占投资的２９．６％，这不仅大大低于工业总平均回收率（２０７．１８％），而且也低于采掘工业平均回收率（９２．１３％）。近年基本建设投资虽然名义上改为贷款，但由于煤矿根本没有还本付息的能力，实质上仍然是无偿投入。而且，国家每年还要拿出一大笔钱补贴煤矿亏损，以１９８７年为例，国家１年要拿出７０多亿元的资金（投资５８．１亿元，亏损补贴１４．４９亿元），实际上是通过煤矿供应低价煤的形式暗补了用煤单位和地方。在这样一种情况下，用煤行业和地方都不愿把钱投在办煤矿上。这几年各省（区）对于煤矿的投资为９．５９亿元，１９８６年减为７．１５亿元，１９８７年为７．６６亿元。如果扣去建设用原材料涨价因素，实际的下降幅度还要大些。
    从煤矿自身来说，由于煤价太低，煤矿的生产费用不能从售价中得到补偿，长期靠国家补贴过日子，又加上国家的财政困难，给煤矿“输血”无法输足，使煤矿长期陷于困境。从１９５９年到１９８８年的３０年间，统配煤矿全行业亏损的年份达到１１年。企业亏损而超过５０％的有１９年。１９８７年的亏损面达到７２．８％。地方国营煤矿的企业亏损面也达到５３％。煤炭涉及各行各业，涉及千家万户，煤价问题是一个很敏感的问题，解决这个问题需要时间和过程，但是，不能回避，只有逐步理顺煤价，煤炭工业才能健康发展。
    稳定矿工队伍，百倍地关心矿工生活是增加煤炭工业后劲不可缺少的重要保证。煤炭行业职工作业条件艰苦、危险。国外的矿工工资普遍高于其它行业。在我国的前２０—３０年内，煤炭行业的平均工资也一直居于各行各业之前。近几年情况发生了变化，已经由１９８４年的第４位降到１９８５年的第１２位。１９８６年工资调整后一度回升到第３位，但由于全行业亏损，工人拿不到应拿的工资。１９８７年工资水平又降到全国第１１位。这种状况怎么能够稳住煤矿工人队伍？
    现在离２０００年只有１２年了，作为主要能源的煤炭生产，不安排好，不重视后劲，到实在不能为继的时候再抓，就来不及了。?
