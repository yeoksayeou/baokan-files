	With the opening of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to international navigation, China's largest inland port—Nanjing Port—has gradually shifted to external operations, directly handling the transportation of import and export goods. In 1988, Nanjing Port received 302 international shipping vessels, handling 218 million tons of foreign trade goods.

	Previously, Nanjing Port primarily handled goods transferred via railways and highways, and ocean-going ships could not dock. Goods exported from this city and the provinces and municipalities along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River all had to be transported to Shanghai for export, which took more time and resulted in greater cargo damage.

　　内河港南京港已向外转
    据新华社南京三月二十七日电  （记者费强）随着长江下游航道的对外开放，我国最大的内河港—南京港已逐步向外转，直接承担进出口物资的运输业务。一九八八年，南京港接待国际航运船舶三百零二艘次，吞吐外贸物资二百一十八万吨。
    南京港过去以中转铁路、公路的物资为主，海轮不能靠港。这个市及长江上游各省、市出口的货物都要运往上海出口，费时多，货物损耗大。
