The 1989 Minorlin Cup Chinese Chess Master Tournament concluded today in Beijing. Reporter Wang Dazhao reports: Hebei's Li Laiqun has become the first Chinese chess master. In the afternoon's final match, he defeated Zhao Guorong from Heilongjiang.

The tournament, organized by the Railway Sports Association and others, featured six chess players in a single round-robin format. Li Laiqun, Zhao Guorong, and Guangdong's Lü Qin had the same score. After calculating the small points, Lü Qin was 0.75 points behind and finished third, watching as the two international grandmasters competed for the chess master title. Li Laiqun, who usually avoids "chaotic" games, drew the first move and took every opportunity to initiate an attack. In the end, he won amidst a fierce battle.

However, the 30-year-old chess master did not show much joy in his post-match interview. He was worried about the rumors that chess competitions might be removed from the National Games. Li Laiqun said, "I love playing chess, not for the title of chess master, but because millions of Chinese people love playing chess. We should not spend so much energy imitating foreign countries' newly developed sports projects and neglect developing our own national culture."

### 中国象棋棋圣赛结束  河北名将李来群获冠军

　　中国象棋棋圣赛结束
    河北名将李来群获冠军
    本报北京３月３日讯  记者汪大昭报道：河北省名将李来群今天成为中国象棋第一位棋圣。他在下午进行的１９８９年少林口乐杯象棋棋圣赛决赛中，战胜了黑龙江的赵国荣。
    由火车头体协等主办的这次比赛，六名棋手先进行单循环赛，李来群、赵国荣和广东的吕钦积分相同，经过计算小分，吕钦以０．７５分之差落在第三位，只能坐视两位特级国际大师争夺棋圣头衔。一向不喜下“乱”棋的李来群抽签后走，竟不错过每个机会，主动邀赵国荣对攻，最后在一阵混战中得胜。
    但是，这位３０岁的棋圣在赛后谈话时，脸上并无喜色。原来，关于象棋比赛将被排出全运会的风声正引起他的不安和忧虑。李来群说，我爱下棋，不是为了棋圣头衔，而是因为千千万万中国老百姓爱下棋。我们不应该用很多精力去仿效外国人刚刚搞起来的新兴体育项目，而不重视发展自己的民族文化。
