Taiwan's "Guangda 2" Ship Caught Smuggling Cigarettes
Offenders Admit Facts; Zhongbao Customs to Handle Appropriately

Xinhua News Agency, Zhuhai, March 10th - Chairman of the Taiwan Guanghua Shipping Company, Chen Yingren, and three others arrived in Zhuhai on the morning of March 9th. They met with relevant personnel from the Zhongbao Customs to discuss the incident where the Taiwan cargo ship "Guangda 2" was caught smuggling cigarettes on March 3rd.

At 1:20 AM on March 3rd, the Zhongbao Customs anti-smuggling vessel intercepted a Taiwan cargo ship carrying a large quantity of smuggled foreign cigarettes near the waters off Danggan Island in Zhuhai City. The ship, named "Guangda 2," had 4,700 boxes of smuggled cigarettes in its cargo hold, valued at 10 million yuan. According to the customs investigation, since last year, the "Guangda 2" has repeatedly smuggled cigarettes into mainland China. The cigarettes it carried this time, including brands like "Kent," "555," and "Marlboro," were intended to be transferred to pre-arranged smuggling ships in the waters between Hong Kong and Taiwan.

Zhongbao Customs Director Yang Junsheng told reporters that according to the initial investigation by the customs, this is a major smuggling case, and the facts have been basically confirmed. The relevant personnel on the ship who were questioned by the customs also admitted to the smuggling activities, as well as the methods, locations, and contact codes for transferring the smuggled goods. Chairman of the Taiwan Guanghua Shipping Company, Chen Yingren, also admitted the smuggling facts of the "Guangda 2" during his contact with our side.

Yang Junsheng pointed out: China's "Customs Law" has clear regulations on smuggling crimes and smuggling activities. We must handle smuggling activities according to the law, which is the responsibility entrusted to the customs by the state. For this, we will handle it appropriately according to relevant laws and policies, based on the case and the attitude of the parties involved.

    拱北海关关长杨俊声告诉记者，据海关初步审理，这是一起重大的走私案件，情况已基本查实。接受海关调查的船上有关人员也供认进行走私以及交接私货的方法、地点和联络暗号。台湾光华轮船股份有限公司董事长陈盈仁在与我方接触中也承认了“光大二号”货轮的走私事实。
    杨俊声指出：我国《海关法》对走私罪和走私行为有明确规定。对走私活动我们必须依法查处，这是国家赋予海关的职责。对此，我们将按照有关法律和政策，根据案情和当事人的态度将尽快作出妥善处理。
