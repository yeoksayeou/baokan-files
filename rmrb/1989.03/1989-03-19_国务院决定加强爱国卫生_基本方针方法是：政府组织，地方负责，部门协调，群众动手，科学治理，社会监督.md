The State Council recently issued a decision on strengthening patriotic hygiene work.

The decision states that the national and local patriotic hygiene committees are non-permanent institutions under the State Council and local people's governments, responsible for the unified leadership and coordination of national and local patriotic hygiene and disease prevention work. The basic principles and methods for this work are: government organization, local responsibility, departmental coordination, mass participation, scientific management, and social supervision. The focus of medical and health work should be on prevention. Based on the public's affordability, social fundraising, voluntary services, and paid services should be carried out in a way that suits local conditions to develop public welfare health services. We warmly welcome donations and investments from people at home and abroad to build health and welfare facilities.

To achieve the strategic goal of "everyone enjoying health care by the year 2000," the document specifies the main tasks for the current period: persist in using scientific methods to continue organizing and leading the "Four Pests" eradication campaign; in cities and rural areas nationwide, especially in large and medium-sized cities and open tourist areas, environmental improvement should be carried out in a focused and step-by-step manner, adding health infrastructure, strengthening health supervision, and further improving the environmental health situation; coordinate relevant departments to implement the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" stipulations for rural water improvement, so that by 1990, 80% of the rural population will have access to safe and hygienic drinking water; vigorously develop the health education industry for all, popularize health science knowledge, and enhance the public's self-health care capabilities; organize and coordinate relevant departments to formulate preventive measures and emergency responses for major epidemics, poisoning accidents, and other sudden events.

The decision proposes that the current focus should be on deepening reforms, exploring new mechanisms and methods, and strengthening the management of patriotic hygiene work. Competitions and evaluations are effective methods to motivate the masses and should continue to be used. Establish the Patriotic Hygiene Month system and plan to do a few things that benefit the masses.
