Since liberation, China has built many large bridges across the Yangtze River, such as the Wuhan and Nanjing bridges. However, which one is truly the "First Bridge over the Yangtze River"?

In 1987, Xinhua News Agency published an article titled "There Was a Bridge over the Yangtze River 600 Years Ago," which stated that as early as 618 years ago, there was a bridge over the Yangtze River at Qutang Gorge. During the early Ming Dynasty, Zhu Yuanzhang sent generals Tang He and Kang Mocai to capture Qutang Pass. The emperor of the Summer Kingdom, Ming Sheng, ordered Mo Ren to cast iron chains across the river at Qutang Gorge, and to drill holes in the rock walls on both sides to erect an iron chain bridge. Wooden planks were laid on the bridge, and cannons were placed on it to guard the pass. Tang He and his troops saw the bridge and retreated in awe, in the year 1369. This flying bridge was 925 meters long. In fact, as early as the Jin Dynasty's Tai Shi Eighth Year (273 AD), Wu Jian, the governor of Pingtai, had connected multiple iron chains across the Yangtze River at strategic points in western Hubei Province, such as Xiling, Yidao, and Jingmen, to block the Jin army's advance eastward. This was 1,096 years earlier than the Qutang Gorge iron chain bridge.

However, the first bridge over the Yangtze River that could truly accommodate large armies and transport goods was built during the Song Dynasty's Kaibao Seventh Year, or 975 AD. During this time, Song Taizu Zhao Kuangyin sent generals Cao Bin and Pan Mei to lead troops to attack the Southern Tang Dynasty. They built a large floating bridge across the Yangtze River near the Southern Tang capital of Jinling (Nanjing) using thousands of large ships connected together. Later, Cao Bin and Pan Mei led their troops across the river as if walking on flat ground and eventually captured Jinling, destroying the Southern Tang Dynasty. This floating bridge was approximately 1,400 to 1,500 meters long, slightly shorter than today's Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, and has a history of 1,013 years. I believe this seems to be the "First Bridge over the Yangtze River."

### 哪个是“长江第一桥”

　　哪个是“长江第一桥”
    解放后我国修建了武汉、南京等多座长江大桥，但究竟哪座是“长江第一桥”？
    １９８７年，新华社发《六百年前就有长江大桥》称：早在６１８年前，瞿塘口就建有长江大桥。明初，朱元璋派大将汤和康茂才等夺瞿塘关，夏国皇帝明升命令莫仁铸在瞿塘口江面横贯铁链锁江，又在两岸石壁打孔，架起铁索桥，桥面上铺木板，放上大炮，严守关口，汤和等望桥兴叹，畏而退，时为１３６９年。这座飞桥长９２５米。其实，早在晋泰始八年（公元２７３年），吴建平太守吴彦，就于湖北省西部的西陵、夷道、荆门等地长江江碛要害处，用多道铁锁连系两岸横断江路，抵御晋师东下。它比瞿塘口铁索桥要早１０９６年。
    但是，真正能行大军，运众物的长江大桥，应是宋开宝七年即公元９７５年，宋太祖赵匡胤派大将曹彬、潘美等率兵伐南唐时，在南唐国都金陵（南京）之西的采石长江江面上，用数千艘大船连接两岸而成一座大浮桥。后曹彬、潘美帅兵由此渡江，若履平地，终于攻克金陵，灭了南唐。这座浮桥长约一千四五百米，略短于今日的南京长江大桥正桥，已有１０１３年的历史了。我认为这似乎是“长江第一桥”。
