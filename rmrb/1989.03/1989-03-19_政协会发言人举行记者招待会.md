Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 18th.

The spokesperson for the 7th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held his first press conference this afternoon.

He announced to the approximately 200 Chinese and foreign journalists present that the central theme of the 7th National Committee of the CPPCC's second session is to discuss and consult on the treatment of the economic environment, the rectification of economic order, the comprehensive deepening of reforms, and other major issues of concern to the people.

Lu Zhichao first introduced the progress of the work of the CPPCC in various aspects since the first session of the 7th National Committee and announced the main agenda of this session. He said that the session will elect additional vice-chairpersons and standing committee members of the CPPCC. He then answered questions from the journalists.

When asked about the political consultations before major national decisions are made, Lu Zhichao said that such consultations are becoming more frequent. He cited many examples, including the scientific debate over the Three Gorges Project, which has drawn both domestic and international attention. The CPPCC has held multiple consultations and discussions on this matter. The 14 specialized committees of the CPPCC also frequently communicate with relevant government departments to consult on important issues and have conducted dozens of special investigations and studies on this basis.

Some Taiwanese and foreign journalists asked about the participation of non-Communist Party members in the leadership of various levels of government. The deputy director of the CPPCC's press group and secretary-general of the Jiusan Society, Zhao Weizhi, introduced the situation in this regard. He said that according to the principle of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, more non-CPC members will hold government leadership positions in the future. This work is currently being discussed by the various democratic parties and the CPC.

    有记者问及国家重大决策在作出前的政治协商情况。卢之超说，这样的协商日益增多。他举出许多实例，其中包括国内外瞩目的三峡工程科学论证，政协就多次进行了协商讨论。全国政协的１４个专门委员会还经常与政府有关部门联系，对一些重要问题进行协商，在此基础上进行了几十项专题调查研究。
    有的台湾记者和外国记者问及不是中国共产党党员的人士参加各级政府领导工作问题。政协会议新闻组副组长、九三学社秘书长赵伟之介绍了这方面的情况。他说，根据中国共产党领导的多党合作的原则，今后将有更多的非中共党员担任政府领导职务。这项工作正由各民主党派和中共研讨之中。
