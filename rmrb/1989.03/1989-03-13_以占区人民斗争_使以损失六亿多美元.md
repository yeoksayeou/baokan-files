The struggle of the Palestinian people in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip has caused Israel to suffer economic losses amounting to $666 million.

The Israeli minister of communications, Gad Yaacobi, was quoted by Israeli newspapers as saying that the resistance of the Palestinians in the occupied territories has resulted in significant economic damage to Israel.

The minister stated that Israel's economic growth rate for 1988 was initially projected to be 2.5%, but the actual growth rate was only 1%, significantly lower than the 1987 growth rate.

According to reports, the tourism industry has been severely affected, with the number of tourists decreasing by 14% compared to the previous year. Production has also been seriously impacted, with the total sales of Israeli goods to the occupied territories dropping by 70% in 1988. Yaacobi warned that Israel's economic losses this year may be similar to those of last year.

　　以占区人民斗争
    使以损失六亿多美元
    新华社开罗３月１２日电  据以色列报纸援引以色列电讯部长加德·雅各比的话报道说，在被占领的约旦河西岸和加沙地带巴勒斯坦人的反抗斗争，已使以色列遭受６．６６亿美元的经济损失。
    这位以色列部长说，１９８８年以色列经济增长率预计可达２．５％，而实际只增长１％，大大低于１９８７年的增长速度。
    据报道，旅游业受到打击，游客比前一年减少１４％。生产受到严重影响，以色列商品１９８８年向被占领土的出售总额下降７０％。雅各比警告说，今年以色列的经济损失可能将同去年差不多。
