Hong Kong's Lantau Island has yielded Bronze Age artifacts

HONG KONG, March 10 — The Hong Kong Archaeological Society recently conducted excavations at the village of Shap Wat in Pung Tree Bay on Lantau Island, uncovering artifacts dating back 3,000 years to the Bronze Age. This discovery provides evidence that residents of the region at that time were capable of producing bronze tools.

According to Qin Wei-Liang, the society's president who oversaw the excavation, this is a significant find for Hong Kong archaeology. Among the unearthed artifacts are a sandstone mold used for casting bronze axes and a bronze arrowhead. This sandstone mold is the first of its kind to be discovered in Hong Kong's prehistoric history.

Qin Wei-Liang noted that preliminary research indicates the Shap Wat site also contains artifacts from the late Neolithic period (around 4,000 years ago) and fragments of Tang Dynasty kilns. The excavated items include a finely polished stone tool from the late Neolithic period used for woodworking.

He also revealed that another important discovery from this excavation is the remains of a rhinoceros from the Bronze Age. This proves that rhinoceroses still inhabited Hong Kong during the Bronze Age. He explained that rhinoceros remains have been found in some southern Chinese regions, but these are all from the Paleolithic or Neolithic periods. This archaeological finding confirms that rhinoceroses were still present in southern China during the Bronze Age.

It is reported that near the excavation site, a complete Bronze Age pottery vessel was unearthed during a housing construction project in 1972. This pottery vessel is believed to have been a burial item.

　　香港南丫岛发现青铜时代文物
    本报香港３月１０日电  香港考古学会最近在南丫岛榕树湾沙甫村进行考古发掘时，在一处遗址发现了属青铜时代、距今３０００年前的遗物，证明当时该地区居民已能制造青铜用具。
    据负责发掘工作的该会会长秦维廉说，这是本港发掘工作中一项重要发现，因为出土遗物中包括一个由沙岩制成制造铜斧的铸模及一个铜箭镞，这种沙岩铸模是本港首次发掘出来的史前遗物。
    秦维廉表示，据目前初步研究调查所得，沙甫村遗址亦藏有新石器时代晚期（约４０００年前）的遗物，及唐代的灰窑碎片；出土文物中还有一新石器时代晚期的精细打磨木工用的有段石?。
    他还透露，这次进行的发掘工作，另一项重要发现，是在遗址中发现青铜时代的犀牛骨骼遗址。这证明香港在青铜时代仍有犀牛。他解释说，犀牛遗址曾在华南一些地区发现，但这些全属旧石器时代或新石器时代的遗址。这次考古发现，证明了到青铜器时代，华南地区仍有犀牛生活。
    据悉，在发掘遗址附近，于１９７２年在进行建屋工程时，也曾掘出一完整的青铜时代的陶罐。该陶罐相信为葬品之一。
