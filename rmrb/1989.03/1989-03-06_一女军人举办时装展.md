The first fashion show hosted by a soldier, "Wang Yawen Fashion Design Exhibition," was held here today. Unlike most fashion shows, this exhibition, which aims to provide a stylish wardrobe for women soldiers who have transitioned from military to civilian roles, has clearly won the favor of its intended audience. Wang Yawen, 34, is a fashion designer at the Navy Political Department's Television Drama Production Center.

　　一女军人举办时装展
    据新华社北京３月４日电  （通讯员杨永革、记者张海平）第一个由军人举办的时装展览——“王雅文服装设计展”今天在这里举行。与大多数时装展不同，这个旨在使脱去军装、改为文职的军中女性得到一个漂亮服饰的展览显然受到了它的顾客的欢迎。３４岁的王雅文是海军政治部电视剧制作中心的服装设计师。
