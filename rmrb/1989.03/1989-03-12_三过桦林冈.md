Last spring, one day, I was heading to F City for a work assignment. I didn't have time to eat dinner before leaving. I told the driver, Xiao Zhang, to buy some snacks for the road to stave off hunger. Xiao Zhang decisively said, "Don't bother, we can stop at a small restaurant along the way!" I said, "This road, I've traveled it countless times, and I've never seen any decent restaurants." He said, "How can there be none? Huanglingang has several!"

Hearing this, I couldn't help but laugh. Indeed, on the way to F City, there is a place called Huanglingang, and on the hill, there are a few small restaurants. But what kind of restaurants are they? In the summer, flies swarm in clouds above your head, and you can't shoo them away. In the winter, wind and snow blow in through the door and window cracks, and you can't brush them off. The food they serve is either too salty or too bland. The soup made from dishwater and the dishes made from dirty roots make it impossible for you to swallow. Many times, I'd rather endure the growling of my empty stomach than stop there for a moment. Today, when Xiao Zhang mentioned Huanglingang again, I quickly shook my head and said, "Spare me, that Huanglingang of yours is really not worth praising!"

"You're always stuck in the past, things are changing all the time! This time, follow me, I guarantee you'll be satisfied!"

I half-believed, half-doubted him and set off on the road.

The car sped along like a lightning bolt, jostling me up and down. Before long, the little bit of tea and leftover food in my stomach was all shaken out, and my belly was growling with hunger. Xiao Zhang seemed to notice my predicament and quickly reassured me, "Don't worry, we're almost there!"

The car passed through a desolate wilderness and entered a forested area. The night gradually fell, and the lights from the birch trees filtered through, casting dappled shadows. Climbing the hill, the car stopped at a place where the lights were relatively bright. Getting out of the car, I saw a new brick building in front of me, with a modern design, small and elegant; two new wine banners hung at the door, with red backgrounds and golden tassels shining brightly under the lights; above the door, a long rectangular red plaque with bold, upright characters read: "Spring Light Restaurant." The calligraphy was elegant and had the air of a master's work.

Xiao Zhang gently knocked on the door, and immediately heard someone call out, "Coming!" The voice was clear and melodious. As the door opened, a young woman, about twenty-seven or twenty-eight, greeted us with a smile, "Welcome, please come in!"

Entering, the room was dazzlingly bright. The white walls gleamed under the radiant lights. Four round tables were neatly arranged, with a small flower bed in the middle: lush green cycads, blooming roses, in a riot of colors. The air was filled with a faint fragrance. Xiao Zhang glanced at me, as if to say, "How about it, are you satisfied?" At the same time, he whispered in my ear, "The one who just opened the door is the owner, everyone calls her Sister Lan."

"Please sit down and rest," Sister Lan smiled and came over to us, holding a ceramic tray with steaming towels. I took one and wiped my hands and face while sizing her up. She had a pair of bright, black eyes shining under a sky-blue triangular headscarf; a white apron was tied around her slender waist, making her look spirited and efficient.

"Sister Lan, don't you recognize me?" Xiao Zhang smiled and said to her.

"Oh, it's Xiao Zhang! I'm sorry, I didn't see you clearly just now. Where are you from?"

"From the provincial capital," Xiao Zhang replied.

"Thank you for coming, please give us your support!" Sister Lan smiled, her cheeks dimpling. "How would you like to order?"

Xiao Zhang knew my eating habits and casually ordered a few dishes I liked, saying, "Can you hurry? We're starving!"

"Please wait a moment," Sister Lan smiled sweetly, "First, have some tea," and then asked me, "Where is this gentleman from?"

"Jiangsu," Xiao Zhang quickly answered for me.

In the blink of an eye, Sister Lan returned, bringing two cups of tea, placing one in front of me and handing the other to Xiao Zhang. I opened the tea cup lid, and a fragrant aroma filled the air. The deep green tea leaves floated up and down in the cup; this was genuine Huangshan Maofeng tea. In Xiao Zhang's cup, however, was the jasmine tea that people from the Northeast love. Oh, I understood why she had just asked me where I was from.

Before we finished our cups of hot tea, the dishes we ordered were served: thin pancakes, smooth rice porridge, and four small stir-fried dishes, all perfectly seasoned, hot and cold just right.

I ate my fill, sweet and fragrant.

During the meal, Xiao Zhang quietly told me: Sister Lan was originally an employee of a certain government agency in the provincial capital. Dissatisfied with the "big pot" distribution system there, she and her husband, who worked as a chef in a hotel, decided to take unpaid leave and chose the busy highway at Huanglingang to open this small restaurant. Her husband manages the kitchen; Sister Lan handles all the front-of-house duties. Because of their attentive service and delicious food, the restaurant has been thriving since it opened, with a steady stream of repeat customers. Just as we were eating, more people came to the restaurant, and all the tables were full. Later, when the room was too crowded, Sister Lan came over and politely asked everyone, "Gentlemen! We really can't handle it today. If you need to eat urgently, please go to the two restaurants next door, they are serving dinner."

"How about we go over there to drink wine with flies?" one customer shouted.

"I'm afraid the sand in the rice will chip my teeth!" another customer grumbled.

"Then please wait a moment, gentlemen!" Sister Lan went into the inner room and quickly brought out a long bench and a stack of books and magazines, smiling and saying, "Please sit down and rest, it will be ready soon!"

The night deepened, and more customers came, but Sister Lan's service was still meticulous and orderly, greeting and seeing off guests with ease.

I passed through Huanglingang for the second time two months later in the summer. That evening, I was returning from F City to the provincial capital, and the driver was still Xiao Zhang. We could have eaten dinner in F City and then left. But I still remembered the delicious meal at Huanglingang, so I declined the host's invitation and hurriedly set off. At that time, the nighttime Huanglingang was hidden in the dense shade of the white birch trees. The car stopped in front of the Spring Light Restaurant. Sister Lan, as usual, greeted us with a smile. Her face seemed a bit haggard, her complexion not as vibrant as before, but she was still clean and efficient, moving quickly. As soon as we sat down, she brought two cups of tea: one was Maofeng, and the other was jasmine, it seemed she had "stored" our information.

This time, we ordered two cold dishes and two cans of beer first. Sister Lan skillfully opened the beer bottle caps for us. Xiao Zhang asked her, "Why not bring two pull-tabs? Sold out?"

"Upstairs said: this is excessive consumption, not in line with our national conditions; we've canceled it and switched to bottled beer. The taste is better!" she said.

"Huh, you're quite policy-conscious!" Xiao Zhang laughed and said to her.

"That's not quite right. But the principle of 'big rivers fill small rivers' is something we understand!" she replied.

For some reason, this time, before we even finished a cup of beer, the lights suddenly went out, and the room was pitch black.

Xiao Zhang and the other customers quickly asked, "What's going on?"

"Please forgive us, this is a temporary power outage!" Sister Lan called out from inside the room. She quickly came out with a large bundle of candles, "Scratch, scratch," lighting the candles one by one, and at the same time hanging a six-sided lantern on the ceiling, instantly making the room bright and red again.

"Huh, Sister Lan, you really know how to handle things!" someone shouted in praise.

"Well, this is a temporary measure!" a customer said.

Xiao Zhang curiously asked, "What happened?"

"It's because Sister Lan didn't serve some people well!" the customer explained angrily, "A few days ago, several important guests came here to eat, and Sister Lan charged a bit of the cost, and they got upset! Look, they're making trouble now. Hmph, it's like a 'power tiger'..."

"Please, gentlemen, don't say that," Sister Lan came out from the inner room and quickly covered up, "It's just that our fuse blew!"

This time, as we left the restaurant, we felt our steps were heavy; Xiao Zhang started the car without a word, but it didn't move a few steps, the car stopped, "Damn it, something's wrong!" Xiao Zhang got out and found that the front tire was flat, and the car was stuck in a small ditch by the roadside, refusing to budge; despite the engine roaring loudly.

Sister Lan heard the noise and came out, seeing the situation, her brows furrowed tightly, and she sighed, "Isn't this deliberately making things difficult for us?" She simultaneously explained to us: recently, several nights in a row, customers' bicycle valves were pulled out, and car tires were punctured.

At this time, the lights in the neighboring houses were on, and strange singing and laughter came from inside.

With great difficulty, we changed the spare tire. When our car started, the lights in the Spring Light Restaurant were still off, but the customers had already left...

The autumn wind was chilly. I passed through Huanglingang for the third time. Unable to withstand the killing frost of autumn, the small white birch leaves had all fallen, leaving bare branches trembling in the cold air.

The sky was overcast, with not a single gap, and sitting in the car, I felt cold from my toes to my head. How I longed for a cup of hot soup to warm my body. Xiao Zhang, while stepping on the accelerator, said to me, "When we get to Huanglingang, let Sister Lan brew a cup of hot wine, and pair it with a plate of braised pork, and you'll be steaming with warmth."

Xiao Zhang's infectious words made my mouth water.

We arrived at Huanglingang at around two in the afternoon, just when hunger was at its peak. The car screeched to a halt in front of the Spring Light Restaurant. We eagerly got out of the car and looked, our hearts immediately sank. The restaurant's wine banners were gone, the restaurant sign had been taken down, leaving a long rectangular white mark. The door was tightly closed, and someone had written in large, bold strokes on the wall: "This house is for sale, price to be discussed."

I couldn't help but be startled: what was going on? Just as I was wondering, the side door of the restaurant opened, and a large truck drove out from the courtyard, loaded with kitchen utensils and household items. Sister Lan, wrapped in a headscarf, sat at the back of the truck, her face pale. "Sister Lan!" Xiao Zhang ran over to greet her, but the truck started moving. Sister Lan waved her hand, saying nothing. Soon, the truck disappeared in a cloud of dust. I stood there for a long time, gazing into the distance...

　　三过桦林冈
    程树榛
    去年春天的一天，我赶着去Ｆ地公出。晚饭未来得及吃就上路了。我让司机小张买点点心带上，以便路上充饥。小张果决地说：甭带了，在路上下小馆吧！我说，这条路我走过多少次了，从来未见到有什么像样的饭馆。他说，怎么没有？桦林冈就有好几家呢！
    听了他这话，我不禁哑然失笑。不错，在去Ｆ地必经之处，是有一个名叫桦林冈的所在，冈上确实有几家小饭馆。可那是什么样的饭馆呀！夏天，苍蝇成群结队地在你头上盘旋，赶都赶不走。冬天，风雪从门缝窗口直往你身上钻，掸都掸不掉。做出来的菜，咸不咸，淡不淡；刷锅水烧的汤，带泥的根做的菜，让你根本没法下咽。我好多次宁肯忍受辘辘饥肠的抗议，也不愿在那儿停留一会儿。今天当小张又提起桦林冈时，我连忙摇头说：“饶了我吧，你那个桦林冈实在不敢恭维！”
    “你别总翻老皇历，情况在不断变化嘛！这回跟我走，包您满意！”
    我将信将疑同他上路了。
    汽车风驰电掣般地飞速行驶，颠簸得我上下直扑腾。没过一会儿，胃里那点残茶剩饭，就被折腾光了，肚里饿得直叫唤。小张似乎看出我的窘态，连忙安慰我说：“别急，就要到了！”
    汽车经过一段杳无人烟的荒原，开到一片森林地带。夜幕便渐渐垂下来，点点灯光透过白桦林，筛出斑驳树影。攀上土冈，汽车在一处灯光较为明亮的地方停了下来。下车一看，呈现在我眼前的是一座新盖的砖房，式样新颖，小巧玲珑；门前挂两个崭新的酒幌儿，红底金边的穗儿在灯光下亮得耀眼；门脸上高悬一个长方形红字匾额：春光饭馆。字迹劲猷挺拔，有名家之风。
    小张上前轻轻地敲了敲门，立即听到有人叫了声：“来了！”声音清脆圆润，随着大门敞开，一个大约二十七八岁的青年妇女满面春风地向我们打招呼：“客人请进！”
    进门一看，室内一片炫亮，雪白的墙壁在灿灿灯光映照下，通明耀眼。四张圆形方桌，整齐地摆开，中间是个小花坛：葱绿繁茂的君子兰，盛开的月季，姹紫嫣红，色彩纷呈。空气里飘着一股淡淡的香味。小张望了望我，似乎在说：怎么样，还满意吧？同时悄悄向我耳语：“刚刚开门的那位，是这儿的老板娘，人们都叫她兰嫂。”
    “客人先请坐下休息！”老板娘含笑来到我们面前，手里端着一个瓷盘，盘中盛着冒着热气儿的毛巾。我接过一方，一边擦拭着手脸，一边打量着她。只见她一双黑亮的大眼睛，在天蓝色的三角头巾下闪着亲切的光；雪白的小围裙，束在窈窕的腰围间，显得飒爽、利落。
    “兰嫂，不认识我了？”小张笑着对她说。
    “噢，原是小张师傅！怪我眼拙，刚刚没看清，您从哪来？”
    “从省城来，”小张回答。
    “谢谢光临，请多多关照！”兰嫂笑了，两颊现出两个好看的酒窝。“请问怎么用餐？”
    小张知道我的饮食习惯，随口点了几样我爱吃的饭菜，说：“能不能快点？我们可饿坏了！”
    “请稍候，”兰嫂莞尔一笑，“先喝杯茶，”又转而问我：“这位客人是哪里人？”
    “原籍江苏！”小张忙代我回答。
    转眼间，兰嫂过来了，端上两杯茶，一杯放在我面前，一杯递给小张。我打开茶杯盖，一股清香扑鼻，深绿色的茶叶在杯里上下飘游着，这是标准的黄山毛峰；而小张杯里却是东北人爱喝的茉莉花茶。哦，我悟出来她刚刚询问我是哪里人的原因了。
    一杯热茶未尽，我们所要的饭菜端上来了：薄薄的烙饼，匀匀的米粥，外加四盘小炒，全都冷热可口，咸淡相宜。　　
    我甜甜香香地吃了个饱。
    在吃饭期间，小张低声告诉我：兰嫂本是省城某机关的工作人员，因不满意那儿“吃大锅饭”的分配方式，便和在一家宾馆作厨师的丈夫一起停薪留职，选择交通要道桦林冈，开了这个小饭馆。灶上的事由他丈夫掌管；里里外外的应酬儿都由兰嫂负责。由于他们服务周到，饭菜可口，自开设以来，一直生意兴隆，“回头客”不断。就在我们吃饭当儿，饭馆内陆续又来了好多人，几张桌子都坐得满满登登；到后来，室内挤不下了，兰嫂过来向大家央求说：“客人们！今儿实在照应不过来了，如急着用餐，请到隔壁两个餐馆看一看，那儿正在供应晚餐。”
    “怎么，让我们到那边用苍蝇就酒喝？”一位客人高声地说。
    “我怕米饭里的沙子硌了我的牙！”另一位客人悻悻地应和着。
    “那就有劳客人稍候了！”兰嫂步入内室，旋即搬出一条长凳，还拿着一摞书刊画报，笑着说：“先请坐下休息，一会儿就得！”
    夜色渐浓，客人也越来越多，但是兰嫂对客人的照应却妥贴周到，迎来送往，有条不紊。
    我第二次经过桦林冈是两个月之后的夏天。那天傍晚，我从Ｆ市回省城，开车的仍是司机小张。我们本来是可以在Ｆ市吃完饭再走的。但我对桦林冈那一餐的余香犹存，就谢绝了主人的挽留，急着上路。这时，夜的桦林冈正隐蔽在白桦织成蓊蓊郁郁莽莽苍苍的浓荫中。车子停在春光饭馆前。兰嫂照例笑盈盈地迎了出来。她的面容似乎有些憔悴，气色不如上次那么鲜活，但仍干净利落，行动迅捷。刚落坐，便端上两杯茶：一杯是毛峰，一杯是茉莉，看来她是把我们两人的信息都“储存”起来了。
    这次，我们先要了两盘凉菜，又要了两罐啤酒。兰嫂熟练地为我们打开啤酒瓶盖。小张问她：怎么不来两个“易拉罐？卖没了？”
    “上边说了：这是超消费，与咱们国情不合；我们把它免了，换瓶装的。这味道更好呢！”
    “嗬，还挺讲究政策的！”小张笑着对她说。
    “那倒说不上。不过，大河涨水小河满的道理，我们还是懂得的！”
    不知怎的，这一次还没等我们一杯酒下肚，电灯忽然灭了，室内一片漆黑。
    小张和其他客人忙问：“怎么搞的？”
    “请原谅，这是临时停电！”兰嫂在室内连声应道。随即手持一大把洋蜡走了出来，“嚓嚓”，连连划着火柴把洋蜡点着，同时又在天棚上挂起一个六角宫灯，一下子满屋又照得通红透亮。
    “嗬，兰嫂，你可真有办法！”有人高声赞美。
    “咳！这也是不得已而为之！”一位客人说。
    小张连忙好奇地问：“怎么回事？”
    “是兰嫂对有些人侍候不周呗！”那人愤懑地解释，“前两天，几个有来头的客人到这儿吃饭，兰嫂收了点成本费，就不高兴了！喏，这不找茬儿来了。哼，真是‘电老虎’……”
    “请客人不要这么说，”兰嫂从室内出来，连忙掩饰，“是俺家保险丝坏了！”
    这一次从饭馆走出时，我们只觉得脚步很沉重；小张一声不吭地启动了汽车，没开出几步，车便不动了，“妈的，出鬼了！”小张下车一看，前轮的轮胎软了，车身陷在路侧的小沟里不愿动弹；尽管发动机叫得山响。
    兰嫂闻声出来，见此情景，眉头皱得很紧，不由叹道：“不是成心要我们的好看吗？”她同时向我们解释：最近几天晚上，连连发生顾客自行车气门心被拔、汽车轮胎被扎的事。
    这时，南邻北舍的灯光却亮着，从里边传来怪声怪气的歌声、笑声。
    好不容易才将备用的轮胎换上。等我们汽车开动时，春光饭馆里的电灯还没亮，而客人却已走光了……
    秋风萧瑟。我第三次路过桦林冈。经不起秋的肃杀，小白桦的树叶，已经落光了，秃秃的枝条，在阴冷的空气中瑟瑟抖动。
    天上彤云密布，连一点缝儿都不闪，坐在汽车里从脚跟往上边发冷。多么想喝一杯热汤来暖暖身子。小张一边加大油门一边对我说：“等到桦林冈，让兰嫂烫一杯热酒，再配上一盘狗肉，包你身上淌热气儿。”
    小张富有感染力的语言，令我满口生津流涎。
    到达桦林冈已是午后两点钟，正是饿得叫劲的时候。小车在春光饭馆门前嘎然停住。我们兴冲冲地从车上下来一看，心里顿时凉了半截。饭馆门前酒幌儿不见了，饭馆匾额已摘下来，留下个长方形的白印儿。大门紧闭，粉壁上有人用粗大的笔触写下如此字样：此房出售，购者面议。
    我不禁吃了一惊：这是怎么回事？正惊疑间，饭馆侧旁大门开了，一辆大卡车从院里开出来，车上装满了炊具和家庭用品。兰嫂包着一块头巾坐在车尾上，面容凄楚。“兰嫂！”小张跑过去招呼，可是，卡车开动了。兰嫂扬了扬手，什么也没说。不一会儿，卡车在扬起一片烟尘后消失了。我久久伫立在那儿，怅然地望着远方……
