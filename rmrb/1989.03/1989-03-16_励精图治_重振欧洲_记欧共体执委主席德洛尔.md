From the outside, Jacques Delors appears unassuming—of average height, with squinting eyes, and a calm demeanor. Compared to the charismatic politicians of his time, he might seem ordinary. Yet, it was he who, a few years ago, took office as the President of the European Commission when the continent was filled with pessimism. In a short span, he leveraged the construction of a unified market to revive Europe's spirit, bringing new vigor to the old continent. Some believe he could become, after Jean Monnet, the most extraordinary figure to contribute to European integration.

Self-Made Scholar: Delors was born on July 20, 1925, in Paris. In France, entering the civil service usually requires attending prestigious institutions like the École Nationale d'Administration, École Normale Supérieure, or École Polytechnique. Delors, however, did not have this privilege. After graduating from high school, he joined the Banque de France as a clerk, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father. Nevertheless, he did not abandon his studies. He worked during the day and attended night classes at the bank's advanced research center, studying economics and law. He spent late nights reading, earning a degree in economics and, through years of practical work, becoming an undeniable expert in finance and economics. Delors, who started as a bank clerk, eventually became a lecturer at the École Nationale d'Administration, the cradle of training high-level administrators.

Delors is a member of the Socialist Party. After the Socialist Party came to power in France in 1981, he took over the Ministry of Finance and was widely regarded as the most capable minister at the time.

"The Relentless Worker": Those who have worked with him describe him as a "relentless worker." As the President of the European Commission, he arrives at the office at 8:30 AM and leaves 12 hours later. He reads large volumes of documents at an astonishing speed, earning him the nickname "the whale." He takes 180 flights a year, traveling, attending meetings, and lobbying. In recent years, the Commission has printed 9,600 speeches, most of which were delivered by him. This intense work schedule naturally affects his colleagues. One of his associates said, "He has no hobbies to occupy his time, and he works on Saturdays too. Fortunately, he goes to Mass on Sundays..." He is a devout Catholic. But upon returning from church, he often dives back into work. His wife lamented, "We have said goodbye to the cinema, even though he loves it."

"The Man of Europe": When he took office in 1985, the European Community faced severe challenges: financial shortages, slow technological development, sluggish economic reforms, and high unemployment. Soon after taking office, Delors proposed the goal of establishing a unified market by the end of 1992. He tirelessly advocated for this, mediating between the 12 member states, finally gaining their agreement. Last year, the special summit in Brussels, after 38 hours of "marathon talks," unanimously adopted the "Delors Plan," named after him, clearing the way for the realization of the unified market. After the meeting, Delors appeared before reporters at 2 AM. The usually reserved Delors showed a smile. Because he had won a "decisive victory."

Last June's European Community summit in Hanover was unforgettable for Delors. In the evening, the leaders held a traditional "fireside chat," inviting him to join them. They asked him to continue as the President of the Commission. Thus, Delors became the second President in the 30-year history of the European Community to serve more than four years.

Now, the talk of "European decline" has been dispelled, and the whole world is discussing the construction of the European market, the rise of the "European Tiger." Therefore, the famous French magazine "Horizons" named him the "News Figure of 1988," calling him "The Man of Europe."

An Ordinary Man: Delors lives modestly, avoids ostentation, and particularly dislikes the theatrical style of politicians. He enjoys being with his old union friends. Delors is a cycling enthusiast and is very familiar with famous cyclists. He has often attended races, cheering with the crowd. He is also a jazz lover. However, his daughter shakes her head when it comes to jazz.

It is said that he can be authoritarian, always believing he is right. But then again, perhaps it is this steadfast confidence that has led to his success in his career. He is a politician and also an ordinary man.

　　励精图治　重振欧洲
    ——记欧共体执委主席德洛尔
    姚立
    从外表看，雅克·德洛尔个头不高，老眯缝着眼，谈吐平淡，少有激情。跟那些叱咤风云的政治家相比，他也许显得太平常了。然而，就是他，几年前当旧大陆充满悲观情绪之时，走马上任，担任了欧共体执委会主席。短短几年，他就以建设统一市场为杠杆，重振了欧洲的士气，使旧大陆出现了虎虎生机。有人认为，他有可能成为继让·莫内之后对欧洲建设贡献最大的不寻常人物。
    自学成才　德洛尔１９２５年７月２０日生于巴黎。在法国，要步入仕途，多半得经国立行政学院、高等师范学校或理工学院等名牌大学。德洛尔却与此无缘。他高中毕业后，进入法兰西银行当了一名小职员，操其祖父和父亲的旧业。不过，他并没有放弃学业。他白天工作，晚上到银行的高级研究中心上夜校，学习经济与法律，深夜还秉灯苦读。他靠这股钻劲获得了经济学学士，并通过十几年的实际工作，成了一名无可争议的金融和经济学家。银行小职员出身的德洛尔最后却以教师的身份登上了培养高级管理人才的摇篮国立行政学院的讲坛。
    德洛尔在政治上属社会党。１９８１年社会党在法国执政后，他出掌财政部，被公认为法国当时最能干的部长。
    “拚命三郎”　跟他共过事的人说，他工作时像“拚命三郎”。担任欧共体执委会主席后，他每天８点半到办公室，１２个小时后才离开。他每天都以极快的速度阅读大量文件，因此得了个绰号：“巨鲸”。他一年要乘坐１８０次飞机，出访、开会、游说……近几年，执委会打印的讲话稿有９６００份，其中大部分出自他口。这种紧张的工作节奏自然要累及合作者，他的一位同事说：“他没有什么嗜好可以占去他的时间，周六也照常工作，幸亏星期天他要去作弥撒……”他是个虔诚的天主教徒。但从教堂回来，他往往又一头扎进工作里。他的夫人遗憾地说：“我们已和电影院告别了，尽管他很想去。”
    “欧洲先生”　他１９８５年任主席时，欧共体面临严峻挑战：资金匮乏、科技发展缓慢、经济结构改革步履维艰、失业率高。德洛尔上台不久，便提出１９９２年底建成统一大市场的目标。他为此奔走呼号，斡旋于１２个成员国之间，终于征得了它们的同意。去年初，布鲁塞尔特别首脑会议经过３８小时的“马拉松会谈”，又一致通过了一项以他的名字命名的“德洛尔计划”，为实现统一大市场扫清了障碍。会议结束后，德洛尔于凌晨两点出现在记者们面前。感情内向的德洛尔的脸上露出了微笑。因为他取得了一场“决定性的胜利”。
    去年６月的欧共体汉诺威首脑会议是德洛尔所难忘的。晚上，首脑们举行过传统的“炉边会晤”，把他叫到炉边，他们请他继续连任执委会主席。这样，德洛尔就成了欧共体３０多年来第二位任期超过４年的主席。
    如今，“欧洲衰落”的议论已为之一扫，整个世界都在谈论欧洲大市场建设，在谈论“欧洲虎”的跃起。所以法国著名的《方位》周刊选他为“１９８８年新闻人物”，称他为“欧洲先生”。
    一个普通人　德洛尔生活简朴，不事张扬，尤其讨厌那种近乎表演的政客作风。他最乐意的是跟当年那些工会朋友在一起。
    德洛尔酷爱自行车赛，非常熟悉那些著名的赛车手，他多次到现场观看，跟观众们一起高喊“加油”。他还是个爵士乐爱好者。不过，他女儿谈起爵士乐就摇头。
    据说他有点专断，总认为自己对。可是话又说回来，或许也正是这种坚定的自信心使他能赢得事业上的成功。他是个政治家，也是个普通人。
