Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 3rd.

The Fushun Petrochemical Plant No. 1 took advantage of the market shortage of petrochemical products to sell excess gasoline, diesel, and other products without adhering to the state's unified pricing policy. They violated financial discipline by using methods such as surcharges and disguised price increases to illegally obtain 21.27 million yuan. Recently, they have been seriously investigated.

Since 1987, the Fushun Petrochemical Plant No. 1 has used "fundraising" and "rebates" as excuses to collect additional fees of 50 to 100 yuan per ton on top of the state-regulated prices from oil purchasing units. To evade inspections by relevant departments, these additional fees were not recorded in the factory's sales income accounts but were instead directed to external accounts or temporarily held in the accounts of purchasing units.

The plant also used the provision of oil products as a condition to directly purchase grains, oils, fish, meat, eggs, and other food items at low prices from purchasing units, totaling over 4,000 tons, and collected disguised surcharges amounting to 4.3 million yuan. Additionally, the plant discovered during self-inspection that they had used "compensatory trade" with purchasing units as a pretext to disguise price increases and retain sales income totaling 10.51 million yuan.

Relevant officials from the State Council's Taxation, Finance, and Price Inspection Office, the Supervision Department, and the State Price Bureau pointed out: The Fushun Petrochemical Plant No. 1 violated state regulations by arbitrarily raising prices, damaging state interests, and engaging in deception by setting up private accounts to evade inspections. The severity of the situation warrants serious punishment. Considering that the plant initially self-inspected and revealed part of the problem and later, under the supervision and assistance of the inspection team, actively provided clues and cooperated with the inspection, showing a good attitude of admitting mistakes, they have been given lenient treatment. The State Price Bureau, Fushun Petrochemical Company, and the company's party committee have decided: The plant's illegally obtained surcharges and low-price purchases of various food items will be confiscated and turned over to the state treasury. The main responsible person, plant director Wang Qing San, will receive an administrative demerit and a serious party warning. Other responsible persons will also receive appropriate disciplinary and party disciplinary actions.

Relevant officials stated that problems similar to those at the Fushun Petrochemical Plant No. 1, involving violations of price policies and financial discipline, are not isolated incidents in steel, petroleum, petrochemical, chemical, non-ferrous metals, and agricultural resource production and operation units. All units should take this as a warning, proactively inspect and correct issues, and hand over any privately set accounts. Inspection teams dispatched by various regions and departments to enterprises should also focus on whether there are violations of price policies and private accounts, and thoroughly investigate these issues.

　　违反财经纪律营私肥己
    抚顺石油一厂受到查处
    有关负责人指出此类问题并非个别现象
    本报北京３月３日讯  新华社记者王迎春、本报记者潘岗报道：抚顺石油一厂趁市场石化产品紧缺之机，在销售计划外汽油、柴油等产品时，不执行国家统一限价，违反财经纪律，采取价外加价、变相涨价等手段，获取非法收入２１２７万元，最近受到严肃查处。
    １９８７年以来，抚顺石油一厂以“集资”、“返利”等形式，除向购油单位收取国家规定的价款以外，每吨还收取价外加价款５０元至１００元。为逃避有关部门的检查，这些加价款未进工厂销售收入帐，而指定购油单位将款汇至厂外帐户或在购油单位“挂帐暂存”。
    这个厂还以提供油品为条件，直接向购油单位低价索购粮、油、鱼、肉、蛋等各种食品４０００余吨，收取变相加价款４３０万元。此外，该厂在自查中还查出以与购货单位搞“补偿贸易”为名，变相加价，截留销售收入１０５１万元。
    国务院税收、财务、物价大检查办公室，监察部和国家物价局有关负责人指出：抚顺石油一厂违反国家规定，任意抬高价格，损害国家利益，而且弄虚作假，私立帐册，逃避检查，情节严重，理应受到严肃处理。鉴于该厂在大检查之初尚能自查出部分问题，后在检查组的督促帮助下，又主动提供线索，配合检查，认错态度较好，故予以从宽处理。国家物价局、抚顺石化公司和公司党委分别决定：对该厂利用厂外帐户收取的加价款和低价索购各种副食品的非法所得全部收缴国库，并给予主要责任人厂长王庆三行政记大过、党内严重警告处分。对其他责任人也分别给予政纪、党纪处分。
    有关方面负责人说，类似抚顺石油一厂的违反物价政策和财经纪律的问题，在钢铁、石油、石化、化工、有色金属、农资等生产经营单位不是个别现象。各单位都要引以为戒，主动检查纠正，交出私设的帐册。各地区、各部门派赴企业的检查组，也要把有无违反价格政策和私立帐册等问题，作为重点查深查透。
