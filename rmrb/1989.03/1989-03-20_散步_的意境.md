The mood of a stroll is a realm of freedom.

The aesthete Zhuāng Báihuá was an aesthete who cherished strolling. In 1957, he wrote an essay titled "A Stroll in Aesthetics," in which he revealed the aesthetic connotations of poetry and painting in a poetic and elegant manner. In 1981, he compiled and published his collection of aesthetic and artistic essays under the title "A Stroll in Aesthetics," further constructing his transcendent and elegant aesthetic style and temperament.

The underlying admiration may not be obvious, but it is indeed real and profound, reflecting his persistent pursuit. He adheres to the simplicity of "strolling," savoring the essence of life in the simplicity of "strolling."

Master Zhuāng seems to be merely talking to himself: "Strolling is a free and unconstrained action. Its weakness is that it lacks planning and system. During a stroll, one can occasionally pick a fresh flower by the roadside, or pick up a piece of jade discarded by others but of personal interest."

Yes. Walk silently, walk calmly, walk lightly, walk to one's heart's content, walk with ease. Think of nothing else, care for nothing else. As long as one is walking, thinking, seeking, beauty will be discovered, flowers will be discovered; even if sometimes what is discovered is merely a "jade stone" discarded by others, as long as it is of "personal interest," that "jade stone" is surely a satisfying gain.

The life of a stroller is indeed plain and unremarkable, but it is not without being a choice in life. The mood of a stroll is peaceful and poetic, vast and profound. Perhaps, only those who possess ample spiritual freedom and are content with the solitude within can truly choose the path of strolling, can truly complete the forging of one's character in the midst of strolling.

### “散步”的意境

　　“散步”的意境
     李慧之
    “散步”是一种自由的境界。
    美学家宗白华是一位崇尚“散步”的美学家。一九五七年，他写了题为《美学的散步》一文，在娓娓诗意中，揭示了诗、画艺术的美学意蕴；一九八一年，他又以《美学散步》为题，编辑出版了他的美学、艺术文集，进一步构筑了他超然淡雅的美学风格和情调。
    深隐其中的崇尚也许是不显然的，但毕竟实实在在让人感到了他的深刻固执的追求。他固守着“散步”的淡泊，他在淡泊的“散步”中品味人生的三昧。
    宗先生似乎只是自言自语地对自己说：“散步是自由自在的、无拘无束的行动，它的弱点是没有计划，没有系统。”“散步的时候，可以偶尔在路旁折到一枝鲜花，也可以在路上拾起别人弃之不顾而自己感兴趣的燕石。”
    是的。默默地走，平静地走，轻松地走，尽兴地走，坦然地走。无意其它，无顾其它。只要走着，思索着，寻着，美就会发现，鲜花就会发现；即使有时发现的只是被人丢弃的“燕石”，只要“自己感兴趣”，那“燕石”又何尝不是一种足以自得的收获呢？
    “散步”的人生的确平淡无奇，但却也不失为人生选择之一种。“散步”的意境是平宁而富于诗意的，是广远而深沉的。也许，只有那些拥有着充分心灵自由并且甘于其中寂寞的人们，才可能真正选择“散步”的路，才可能真正于“散步”之中完成人格的铸就……
