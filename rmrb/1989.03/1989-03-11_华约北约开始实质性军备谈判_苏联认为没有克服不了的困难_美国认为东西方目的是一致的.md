VIENNA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Warsaw Pact and NATO, two major military blocs with 23 countries, held their first substantive talks on European conventional arms control here at the Hofburg Palace.

The agreement of the Vienna Follow-up Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) stipulates that the European conventional arms control talks will cover conventional forces stationed on land from the Urals to the Atlantic across the entire European continent (including the territory of the Soviet Union west of the Ural River and the Caspian Sea). Naval forces, nuclear weapons, and chemical weapons are not included in the negotiations. However, the conventional parts of dual-capability weapons (i.e., those that can use nuclear weapons as well as conventional weapons) must be included in the negotiations. The agreement also stipulates that the 23 countries participating in the European conventional arms control talks should maintain close contact with the 35 countries participating in the European negotiations on confidence-building and security measures, and regularly report to 12 neutral and non-aligned countries, listening to their suggestions.

At a press conference, Oleg Grinevsky, head of the Soviet delegation, warned that discussions about the balance of forces between the two sides are dangerous because comparing various weapon systems is very difficult. He believes that people should first determine a maximum value and then calculate it through inspections, and then reach an agreement through data exchange. The Soviet Union, in principle, accepts measures for international supervision and on-site inspections. He stated that the main contents of the future negotiations to reach an agreement are already quite clear, and it seems that there are no insurmountable difficulties. An agreement on conventional arms reduction can be expected within 2-3 years. He also criticized NATO for limiting conventional arms reduction to only three types of weapons and said: "The Soviet Union has too many tanks, so it will reduce the excess part, and as for air power, NATO must cut more." He concluded by saying that the Soviet Union's unilateral withdrawal should not be seen as an unfounded concession, and the momentum of arms reduction depends on the efforts of both sides.

Stephen Ledogar, head of the U.S. delegation for conventional arms control, said that the plenary session on March 9 was very beneficial and marked a good start. The purpose of the East-West conventional arms control talks is consistent, namely, to first limit offensive weapon systems.

Regarding the Warsaw Pact's request to include naval and air forces in the negotiating agenda, Ledogar believes this will be a problem. Additionally, there are differences in the methods of calculating the number of troops between East and West. Although the NATO plan does not specifically mention reducing the number of troops, reducing tanks, artillery, and armored vehicles naturally includes the personnel using these equipment.

　　华约北约开始实质性军备谈判
    苏联认为没有克服不了的困难
    美国认为东西方目的是一致的
    新华社维也纳３月９日电  （记者肖力）由华约和北约两大军事集团２３国参加的欧洲常规军备谈判９日在维也纳霍夫堡宫举行首次实质性会谈。
    欧安会维也纳续会《最后文件》的协议规定，欧洲常规军备谈判的对象是东西方驻扎在从乌拉尔至大西洋整个欧洲（包括乌拉尔河和里海以西的整个苏联领土）陆地上的常规军备。海军、核武器、化学武器不包括在谈判范围之内，但是双重性能的武器（即能使用核武器，也能作常规武器）的常规部分必须纳入谈判，协议还规定，参加欧洲常规军备谈判的２３国要和参加欧洲建立信任和安全措施谈判的３５国保持密切联系，并定期向１２个中立和不结盟国家通报情况，听取他们的建议。
    苏联代表团团长奥列格·格里涅夫斯基在记者招待会上告诫说，围绕双方军力对比数据的讨论是危险的，因为双方各种武器系统的比较十分困难。他认为，人们应该首先确定一个最高数值以及通过核查来计算，然后通过交换数据来达成一致。苏联原则上接受实施国际监督和实地核查的措施。他表示，今后谈判达成协议的主要内容已经十分清楚，看来没有克服不了的困难。２、３年之内就可望在常规裁军方面达成一些协议。他还批评北约仅仅将常规裁军限制在３种武器范畴之内，并说：“苏联拥有过多的坦克，因此将减少多余的部分，至于空军力量，北约就必须多裁。”他最后还表示，不要把苏联的单方面撤军看作是无根据的让步，裁军的势头要靠双方的努力。
    美国常规裁军代表团团长斯蒂芬·莱多格则表示，９日的全体会议非常有益，是一个良好的开端。东西方常规裁军会议的目的是一致的，即首先要限制进攻型武器系统。
    在谈到华约要求把海、空军纳入谈判日程的问题时，莱多格认为，这将会成为一个问题。此外，东西方在部队人数计算方法上也存在差异。北约的方案虽然没有专门谈到裁减军队人数，但是在裁减坦克、火炮和装甲车时就自然包括了使用这些装备的人员。
