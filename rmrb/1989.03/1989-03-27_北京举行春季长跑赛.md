Ironman athlete Lian Yushan had the honor of becoming the focus of attention in the capital today. He won first place in the men's 10-kilometer race of the Beijing Spring Long-Distance Running Race with a time of 26 minutes and 18 seconds. More than 1,000 athletes participated in today's competition.

Due to funding, transportation, and other reasons, the Beijing Spring Festival City Marathon, which had been held continuously for 25 years, was changed to the Spring Long-Distance Running Race this year, with the longest distance reduced from the previous 25 kilometers to 10 kilometers. According to officials organizing the event, although the number of participants in today's competition was significantly reduced compared to the past, they were all genuine long-distance running enthusiasts, overcoming the previous practice of units assigning and gathering participants.

The Beijing Changzheng Senior Citizens Long-Distance Running Team and the Beijing Marathon Long-Distance Running Team, composed of young people, both performed exceptionally well. One team aims to strengthen the body and prolong life; the other aims to toughen the will and improve performance. Their common point is that they are self-organized and persistent.

　　北京举行春季长跑赛
    本报北京３月２６日讯  记者李北大报道：铁人运动名将连玉山今天有幸成为京城万众瞩目的人物，他在北京春季长跑赛男子１０公里比赛中勇夺第一，成绩是２６分１８秒。１０００多名选手参加了今天的比赛。
    由于经费、交通等诸多方面的原因，连续举办了２５年之久的北京春节环城赛跑从今年改为春季长跑赛，最长距离也由过去的２５公里改为１０公里。据组织赛事活动的官员讲，今天的比赛虽然参赛人数比过去大为减少，但都是真正的长跑爱好者，克服了以往环城赛单位摊派、凑人数的作法。
    北京长征老年人长跑队和由年轻人组成的北京马拉松长跑队两支民间长跑队成绩突出，一支是以强身健体、延年益寿为目的；一支是以磨练意志，提高成绩为宗旨，他们的共同点是自发组织，持之以恒。
