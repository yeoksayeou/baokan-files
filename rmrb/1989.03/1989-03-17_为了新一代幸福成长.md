	For the Happy Growth of the New Generation
	Bai Sun  Poem

	Even if the stars and moon surge,
	The sunlight is vast and boundless,
	The spring water bursts forth from the rocks,
	The forest is filled with the south wind,
	The birds on the branches
	Give the world countless hints.
	I also want to remind you,
	Pay attention to the season of many dreams.
	The green leaves and the spring water,
	And the birds unafraid,
	After all, they are still tender.
	The end of the dream is tomorrow.
	Do not let hope be dislocated.
	While the spring tide surges on the lawn,
		The flowers are in full bloom.

　　为了新一代幸福成长
    白隼  配诗
    纵然星月澎湃
    阳光浩浩荡荡
    泉水从岩缝脱颖而出
    林间有南来的风
    小鸟在枝头
    给世界万千暗示
    我也要提醒你
    请注意多梦时节
    绿叶和泉水
    还有小鸟无畏
    毕竟稚嫩
    梦的尽头才是明天
    不能让希望脱臼
    趁春汛在草坪涌动
    　　花事正浓
