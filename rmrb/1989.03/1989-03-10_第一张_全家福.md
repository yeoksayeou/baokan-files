	The First "Family Portrait"
	On February 20, 1989, when the full moon of the Lantern Festival rose to the zenith, 80-year-old widow Sun Yulan of Face Market Street in Yantai City, trembling with both hands, held up the "family portrait" filled with olive green, facing the sky with boundless emotions: "I have lived alone for 13 years, all thanks to the people's police!"

	Sun Yulan had no children in her life. Before she reached the age of 70, her husband passed away, and her life was full of hardships. A few years ago, the Yantai City Traffic Police Brigade launched an activity to bring warmth to society. The young members of the first squad visited and learned about the widowed elderly Sun Yulan. Since then, the police and the people have formed an unbreakable bond. Every day, the police officers would come to Grandma Sun's house in groups of three or five. Some would cook and wash dishes for the elderly; some would help carry water and sweep the yard; others would go to the street to buy vegetables, coal, and flour for Grandma Sun. Laughter and joy broke the silence of the previously quiet courtyard, moistening the lonely heart of the elderly.

	To reduce the burden on the police officers as much as possible, Grandma Sun would tidy up and clean the house by herself when everyone was not around. As a result, she worked all day and fell ill. The next morning, when police officer Hao Jun entered the door, he saw that Grandma Sun was feverish and unconscious. Without saying a word, he rushed to the hospital to call a doctor. Police officers who heard the news rushed to the store to buy canned food, cakes, and malted milk. However, the elderly only shook her head and did not open her mouth. Little Hao, sitting beside the elderly, was so anxious that he wanted to cry. Finally, he sincerely said to the elderly's ear: "Grandma, tell me what you want to eat. You can't eat when you are sick, it will harm your body." The elderly heard this and tears streamed down her face. She tightly held Hao Jun's hand and after a long time, she said, "Child, Grandma only wants to eat some fish dumplings." Little Hao immediately cheered up and rushed to the Sifu Street Restaurant to buy two pounds of steaming hot fresh fish dumplings. Neighbors saw this and said, "Grandma Sun has a son in her old age, she is blessed!"

	Since then, the 14 young members of the first squad of the traffic police brigade have clearly divided their responsibilities, each taking care of their own duties. Inside and outside the home, Grandma Sun had nothing to do. To alleviate the loneliness of the elderly in her later years, the team also arranged for young members to chat and have a family talk with Grandma Sun every week. On weekends and holidays, they would watch movies and go to the park with the elderly. This rich and colorful life made Sun Yulan's heart full of warmth.

	Years passed, and thirteen years have gone by. The first squad of the Yantai City Traffic Police Brigade has changed four team leaders, and more than 90 young members of the Communist Youth League have been transferred and developed. Taking care of Grandma Sun's life has been passed down from generation to generation and has never been interrupted.

	Before the Spring Festival this year, the young members of the first squad almost broke down Grandma Sun's door. Some brought round peaches, bags of fruits, and pastries; some brought dried shrimp, fresh fish, and eggs. This abundant festival gift seemed to be nothing special to Grandma Sun. Because in her heart, she only had one lifelong wish: she wanted to take a "family portrait" with the public security officers who had been with her day and night for 13 years as a permanent memory.

　　第一张“全家福”
    １９８９年２月２０日，当元宵节的圆月移上中天，烟台市面市街年逾八旬的孤寡老人孙玉兰，双手颤巍巍地捧起那张充满橄榄绿的“全家福”照片，面对苍天无限感慨：“我孤身生活１３载，全托人民警察的福啊！”
    孙玉兰一生无儿无女，未近古稀之年老伴就先她而去，生活可谓坎坷。前些年，市交通警察支队开展向社会送温暖活动，一中队的团员青年在走访时，了解到孤寡老人孙玉兰。从此后，警民间便结下不解之缘。每天，干警们三五成群地到大妈家，有的替老人做饭洗碗；有的帮助担水扫院；还有的到街上给大妈买菜买煤买面，欢声笑语打破了这座以往寂静的小院，滋润了老人那孤独的心田。
    孙大妈为了尽量减轻干警们的劳累，趁大家不在时，自己动手拾掇、清整，结果忙活了一天就病倒了。第二天一大早，民警郝军进门一看，孙大妈浑身发烧，昏迷不醒，他二话没说，转身跑到医院请大夫。闻讯赶来的民警，分别到商店买来了罐头、蛋糕和麦乳精，可老人只是摇头却不肯张嘴，坐在老人身旁的小郝急得直想哭，最后他恳切地对着老人的耳边说：“大妈您想吃啥跟我讲，生了病不吃饭会伤身体的啊。”老人听了泪水洗面，她紧握着郝军的手，半晌才露出一句话：“孩子，大妈只想吃点鱼馅水饺。”小郝一下子乐了起来，飞奔到四德街饭店，买回二斤热气腾腾的鲜鱼水饺。街坊邻居见了都说：“孙大妈老来得子，有福啊！”
    从此后，交警一中队１４名团员青年明确分工，各负其责，家里家外孙大妈啥事都插不上手。为了解除老人的晚年寂寞，团支部还每周安排团员青年去同孙大妈聊天、拉家常，星期天和节假日，同老人一起看电影、逛公园。这丰富多彩的生活，使孙玉兰心底暖流潜动。
    暑往寒来，转眼十三载。烟台市交警一中队团支部更换了四任团支部书记，调动和发展过９０多名共青团员，照顾孙大妈的生活是茬茬相传，从没间断。
    今年春节前夕，一中队的团员青年简直踏破了大妈的门槛，有的送来圆圆的寿桃、一包包水果和糕点；有的送来了海米、鲜鱼和鸡蛋，这丰盛的节日礼品，孙大妈似乎并不稀罕。因为，在老人的心底里，只有一个平生的夙愿，她要与自己朝夕相处１３年的公安干警，在节日里拍下一张“全家福”，作为永恒的纪念。徐忠
