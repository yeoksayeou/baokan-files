The People's Congress exercises legal and work supervision over the government, while the CPPCC conducts democratic supervision. How can these supervisory mechanisms avoid being mere formalities and truly play an effective role? In the current situation where China's supervisory mechanisms are not yet fully developed, the key lies in the government's proactive acceptance of supervision from the People's Congress and the CPPCC, and respecting the democratic rights of people's representatives and CPPCC members.

Over the past year, the Dalian Municipal Government in Liaoning Province has genuinely created conditions for people's representatives and CPPCC members to participate in political and policy discussions.

Publicizing Government Work for Supervision

For people's representatives and CPPCC members to participate in political and policy discussions, they must first be informed. Without understanding the government's work, or even knowing which departments exist and their respective functions, their criticisms and suggestions will be limited to personal experiences or superficial phenomena, making it difficult to effectively supervise the government's work. To enable people's representatives and CPPCC members to be informed, the government must practice open governance.

The Dalian Municipal Government has started by increasing the transparency of its work, providing people's representatives and CPPCC members with more channels to be informed. Last year, they changed from reporting government work once a year at the People's Congress to inviting over 200 national, provincial, and municipal people's representatives and CPPCC members to the government auditorium six months later to report on the municipal government's work for the first half of the year. Leaders of the municipal government and its departments frequently hold seminars and discussions to report on their respective work. In addition, all regular meetings, on-site work meetings, and special work meetings held by the municipal government, as well as inspections at the grassroots level, invite some people's representatives and CPPCC members to participate. By the end of last year, nearly 1,000 people's representatives and CPPCC members had participated in various meetings and activities of the municipal government, submitting 800 criticisms, suggestions, and proposals.

Inviting Supervision Before Major Decisions

Participating in decision-making is an important aspect of people's representatives and CPPCC members exercising their democratic rights. If the government treats this as a mere formality and lacks sincerity in listening to the opinions of people's representatives and CPPCC members, it often turns into notifying them after decisions have been made, making supervision a mere formality.

The Dalian Municipal Government has stipulated that for major policies affecting the entire city and significant issues related to people's lives, the opinions of people's representatives and CPPCC members must be seriously considered before making decisions. Last year, the municipal government invited people's representatives and CPPCC members to join relevant department leaders in studying price work. A people's representative suggested establishing a people's price supervision team, which was highly valued by the municipal government. Soon, a team of over 200 people, mainly composed of people's representatives and CPPCC members, including retired cadres, intellectuals, and worker representatives, was formed. They worked with relevant departments to handle over 600 price violation cases, uncovering 1,527,000 yuan in price violations. Education is an issue that has been strongly reflected by the public in recent years and is difficult to solve. In the second half of last year, the Dalian Municipal Government spent two months, with the mayor presiding, holding over 30 different types of seminars with people's representatives, CPPCC members, educators, and relevant parties to collectively develop 15 measures, gradually solving the difficulties in the education sector.

Practice has shown that most people's representatives and CPPCC members come from the grassroots level and best understand the people's hardships and demands. Some are experts and scholars. Seriously listening to their opinions before making decisions can avoid major mistakes, making decisions more scientific and democratic, which is beneficial to the government's work. Why not do it?

Establishing Special Institutions to Accept Supervision

Whether the criticisms, suggestions, and proposals of people's representatives and CPPCC members can take effect and to what extent is directly related to whether the government is sincere in accepting supervision. If sincere, it will seriously handle and implement them, making them play a role in improving and promoting the government's work.

In March last year, the Dalian Municipal Government established a proposal office within the general office, specifically responsible for handling the criticisms, suggestions, and proposals of people's representatives and CPPCC members, ensuring their implementation at the organizational level. On the morning of the 27th day of the lunar New Year last year, the CPPCC proposal office received a proposal from a member stating that the Songshu Cocoon Station owed farmers 500,000 yuan in cocoon payments, and nearly 200 farmers could not arrange for their New Year's living expenses and spring production. The proposal office immediately called the municipal government proposal office. One hour later, the municipal government proposal office replied: it had reported to the deputy secretary-general and instructed relevant departments to solve the problem as soon as possible. For issues frequently raised by people's representatives and CPPCC members, such as vegetables, gas, and traffic, the Dalian Municipal Government directly convened relevant commission, office, and bureau leaders to solve problems on-site, while inviting people's representatives and CPPCC members to participate and supervise, achieving remarkable results. Last year, Dalian's annual vegetable supply reached 387,000 tons, with the autumn vegetable supply increasing by 53,000 tons compared to the previous year, basically meeting the needs of the citizens.

　　在监督机制尚未健全情况下，大连市政府制订措施        
    主动自觉接受人大政协监督
    刘清敏
    人大对政府实行法律监督和工作监督，政协对政府实行民主监督，如何使这些监督避免走过场，真正发挥切实有效的作用？在我国目前监督机制尚不健全的情况下，关键在于政府要自觉地接受人大和政协的监督，尊重人民代表、政协委员的民主权利。
    一年来，辽宁省大连市人民政府实实在在为人民代表和政协委员参政议政创造条件。
    　　　　公开政府工作供监督
    人民代表、政协委员参政议政，前提是要知情。不了解政府的工作，甚至对政府有哪些机构，各自的职能是什么也不清楚，提出的批评、建议只能局限于身边的事情或一些表面现象，难以对政府工作进行实质有效的监督。而要人大代表和政协委员知情，就离不开政府的政务公开。
    大连市政府从提高政府工作的透明度入手，为人民代表和政协委员拓宽知情的渠道。去年，他们由过去一年一次在人代会上报告政府工作，改为半年过后邀请在大连的２００多位全国、省、市人民代表和政协委员到政府礼堂，向他们全面汇报市政府上半年的工作。市政府和部门的领导经常通过座谈会、研讨会等形式，向人民代表和政协委员通报分管的工作。除此以外，凡是市政府召开的常务会、现场办公会、专项工作会以及到基层检查工作，都邀请部分人民代表和政协委员参加。到去年底，人大代表和政协委员已有近千人次参加了市政府的各种会议和活动，写出批评、建议和提案８００多件。
    　　　　重大决策之前请监督
    参与决策是人民代表、政协委员行使民主权利的重要内容。如果政府把它仅仅看成是例行公事，缺乏听取人民代表和政协委员意见的诚意，往往就会由决策前协商变成决策后通知，使监督流于形式。
    大连市政府规定，对涉及全市的大政方针和人民生活的重大问题，在决策之前必须认真听取人民代表和政协委员的意见。去年，市政府邀请人民代表和政协委员同有关部门的领导同志一起研究物价工作，一位人民代表建议成立人民物价监察队，得到市政府的高度重视。不久，一支以人民代表和政协委员为主体的，有老干部、知识分子和工人代表参加的２００多人的人民物价监察队诞生了。他们会同有关部门处理各种违价案件６００多起，查出违价金额１５２．７万余元。教育是近几年人们反映比较强烈、解决难度又比较大的问题，大连市政府去年下半年集中两个月时间，由市长主持召开了有人民代表、政协委员、教育战线和有关方面同志参加的３０多个不同类型的座谈会，集中大家的智慧制订出１５项措施，使教育战线存在的困难逐步得到解决。
    实践证明，人民代表、政协委员多数来自基层，最了解人民群众的疾苦和要求，有些人还是专家学者，在决策之前认真听取他们的意见，可以避免工作的重大失误，使决策更加科学化、民主化，这是对政府工作有利的好事，政府何乐而不为呢？
    　　　　设立专门机构接受监督
    人民代表、政协委员的批评、建议和提案能否起作用，作用大小，同政府有无诚意接受监督直接相关。如果有诚意，就会认真办理落实，使其发挥出改进推动政府工作的作用。
    大连市政府于去年３月在办公厅内设立了提案处，专门负责办理人民代表、政协委员的批评、建议和提案，从组织上保证了这些批评、建议和提案的落实。去年农历腊月二十七上午，市政协提案处接到一位委员反映松树茧站拖欠蚕农茧款５０万余元，近２００名蚕农无法安排春节生活和春季生产的提案，立即打电话给市政府提案处。１小时后，市政府提案处马上回话：已向主管的副秘书长汇报，并责成有关部门尽快解决。对人民代表和政协委员反映比较集中的蔬菜、煤气、交通等问题，大连市政府由市长直接召集有关委、办、局负责同志下基层现场办公解决，同时邀请人民代表、政协委员参与和监督，取得显著效果。去年，大连市全年蔬菜上市量达到３８．７万吨，秋菜供应量比上年增加５．３万吨，基本满足了市民的需要。
