Recently, Sichuan Province conducted a survey of 140 individual households, 90 production enterprises, 23 companies, and 20 government and organizational units in 7 cities and 3 counties regarding their cash holdings. The results showed that individual households and private enterprises that primarily engage in cash transactions hold a significant amount of cash, making them one of the largest cash holders.

Among the 140 surveyed individual households, the average cash holding per household was 6,433 yuan. Out of these, 19 households held more than 10,000 yuan, accounting for 13.6% of the surveyed households. The highest holding was over 90,000 yuan, while the lowest was around 1,000 yuan. If we calculate based on an average of 3,000 yuan per household, the total cash held by the 1.65 million individual households in the province would be approximately 5 billion yuan, which is about two-thirds of Sichuan Province's total fiscal revenue in 1987. Private enterprises also prefer not to deposit their cash in banks at low interest rates. They keep about 90% of their production and operational income in cash, which is outside the state's financial management system. Most of this cash is used for further production and operations, while the rest is directed towards the consumer market.

Enterprises and government units scattered across the region have formed numerous "small treasuries," creating many underground cash reserves. According to the survey, the average cash reserve for 90 production enterprises, 23 companies, and 20 government and organizational units was around 4,000 yuan, with the highest reserve reaching 45,000 yuan, far exceeding the cash reserve limit set by the bank. Moreover, some of this cash has been converted into bonuses and allowances for employees, inflating the consumption fund. For example, a supply and marketing department in Chongqing distributed 249,000 yuan in year-end bonuses, averaging 1,189 yuan per person.

The large amount of cash circulating in society has made it difficult for banks to withdraw cash. In November of last year, the net cash injection by Sichuan Province's banks was 5.15 billion yuan, an increase of 65.1% compared to the same period last year.

    “笼”外现金寻踪
    不久前，四川省对7市3县的140户个体户、90家生产企业、23家公司及20个机关团体手存现金进行了调查。结果发现，以现金交易为主的个体户和私营企业手存现金数额奇大，成为拥有现金的大户之一。
    被调查的140户个体户平均每户手持现金6433元，其中手持现金在1万元以上的19户，占被调查户的13.6％，最多的达9万多元，最少的也在千元左右。如果按每户平均3000元计算，全省165万个体户手持现金总额约50亿元，相当于1987年四川省财政总收入的2／3。私营企业同样不愿拿低利率把现金存入银行，他们手中生产经营收入占90％的现金游离于国家金融管理系统之外，其中多数继续用于生产经营，剩下的投向消费市场。
    企业、机关星罗棋布的“小金库”形成了众多的蓄积现金的“地下湖”。据调查，90家生产企业、23家公司和20个机关团体平均库存现金4000元左右，最多的企业达4.5万元，大大高出银行核定的现金留存额。而且一部分现金变成了职工包里的奖金、补贴等，膨胀了消费基金，如重庆市某供销部门发放年终奖金24.9万元，人均1189元。
    现金在社会上大量沉淀，造成银行回笼困难。去年11月份四川省银行收支相抵净投放5.15亿元，比上年同期增长65.1％。
