The Unending Flow of the Long River

May 10th of this year marks the first anniversary of the passing of Mr. Shen Congwen. In remembrance of Mr. Shen, the Hunan Literature and Art Publishing House will solemnly publish a large-scale documentary collection titled "The Unending Flow of the Long River," comprising 400,000 words. Mrs. Zhang Zhaohe, Mr. Shen's wife, is the overall planner and designer of this book. Contributors to this book include Mr. Shen's old friends, relatives, scholars, and writers, among them Ba Jin, Huang Yongyu, Wang Zengqi, Jin Jiefu (from the United States), Ma Yueran (from Sweden), and Mr. Shen's second son, Hu Chu, totaling 56 people.

The book, from various angles, portrays Mr. Shen's character and qualities with sincere emotion and substantial materials, providing the first comprehensive and three-dimensional depiction. Many of the mysteries left by Mr. Shen throughout his life are also accurately answered in this book.

The book also includes Mr. Shen's unfinished manuscript, "Abstract Lyricism." The manuscript was discovered in the materials returned after being confiscated for several years. This is a very important work in which Mr. Shen, after liberation, for the first time comprehensively and systematically expounds his fundamental views on literature and art.

　　《长河不尽流》
    今年五月十日，是沈从文先生逝世一周年。为缅怀沈先生，湖南文艺出版社将隆重推出四十万字的大型文献资料性文集《长河不尽流》。沈从文夫人张兆和先生是这本书的整体构思者和设计者。参与本书写作的有沈先生的故旧亲朋及学者、作家，其中有巴金、黄永玉、汪曾祺、金介甫（美国）、马悦然（瑞典）、沈先生次子虎雏等五十六人。
    本书从不同角度，用真挚的感情，翔实的材料，第一次全面、立体地刻划了沈从文的人格和品质。沈先生一生留下的许多谜，也在这本书中有着准确的解答。
    书中还收有沈从文未写完的遗稿——《抽象的抒情》。稿件是在被查抄数年后退还的材料中发现的。这是一篇十分重要的著作，沈从文在解放后第一次较全面、系统理性地阐述自己关于文学艺术的基本观点。
