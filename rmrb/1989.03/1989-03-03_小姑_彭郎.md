From Wuhan, I took a boat down to Poyang Lake, where the water and sky merged, and the vast waves resembled the sea. There was a solitary peak standing alone, which is the Great Solitary Mountain (also known as Big Aunt Mountain). Because the mountain resembles a shoe, it is also called "Shoe Mountain." It guards the lake entrance and, across the water to the west, faces Lu Mountain, like two sentinels guarding the gateway to Jiangxi. As the boat continued downstream, the Big Aunt Mountain gradually disappeared from view, and ahead, the Little Aunt Mountain slowly emerged.

The Tang dynasty poet Gu Kuang wrote, "When the Big Aunt Mountain disappears, the Little Aunt Mountain appears." In the Song dynasty, Ouyang Xiu's "Return to the Countryside" records: "In the river, there are Big and Little Solitary Mountains standing alone. Common people refer to them as Big and Little Aunt Mountains. Near the river, there is a rock called Peng Lang Rock, and 'Lang' is a transformation of 'Lang' (wave). It is said that this is the husband of the Little Aunt." Su Dongpo, in his inscription on Li Shunxun's painting of the "Long River's Solitary Island," wrote: "Boatmen, do not be reckless; the Little Aunt married Peng Lang last year." The Aunt and Lang face each other across the water, guarding each other day and night. Below them, the Machang Pass serves as a shield, and it has always been a crucial strategic point for river defense. Over time, combined with the descriptions by famous scholars, this scenic spot has become a romantic tale, celebrated for its beauty.

The Little Aunt Mountain resembles a woman's hair bun and is also known as the Bun Mountain. It stands in the river to the northwest of Pengze County (now part of Anhui's Susong County), in a treacherous location. It is known as the "Pillar of the Sea Gate" and the "First Pass of the Sea Gate," with hundreds of stone steps winding up the mountain. Along the way, there are famous sites such as Tianmen, Longer Cave, Mituo Pavilion, Xianyue Tower, Half-Side Pagoda, Jiechao Temple, Shuizhuang Pavilion, Imperial Poem Stele, and Longjiao Rock, all of which have been "renovated" to welcome visitors. The view from the mountain top of the surging river tides is also a must-see, and in 1985, it was designated as a key tourist area in Anhui.

Currently, the relevant departments in Pengze County, Jiangxi Province, have rebuilt the Peng Lang Pavilion, Guan Ju Pavilion, and Longjin Temple on Peng Lang Rock, and there is a statue of "The Little Aunt and Peng Lang Depend on Each Other," making the beautiful and virtuous image of this romantic legend concrete.

Traveling here, you cannot help but be attracted by the charming figure of the Little Aunt, lingering and reluctant to part, with thoughts of staying longer. You might as well take the opportunity to climb the mountain and feast your eyes on the beautiful scenery of the river and mountains. Facing the relentless flow of the river, day and night without rest, your thoughts will wander.

    小姑·彭郎
    倪建中
    自武汉乘轮下行至鄱阳湖口，见水天相接，洪涛如海，有一峰独峙，即大孤山（大姑山）。因山形似鞋，又叫“鞋山”，屏障湖口，西与庐山隔水相望，宛如守备江西门户的水陆“双岗”。顺流下驶，后面大姑山逐渐隐没，前眺小姑山慢慢显现。唐代顾况诗云：“大姑山尽小姑出”，宋欧阳修《归田录》谓：“江中有大小孤山巍然独立，世俗转孤为姑，江侧石矶曰彭浪矶，又转浪为郎，云是小姑夫婿”。苏东坡题《李思训画长江绝岛图》句：“舟中贾客莫漫狂，小姑前年嫁彭郎。”姑、郎隔水相望，朝夕厮守。其下有马当要塞为之屏蔽，向为江防重地，自古民间传闻，再加上名士绘形绘色的描述，遂有此景物拟人的风流韵事，引为美谈。
    小姑山形似妇女发髻，又名髻山，屹立在彭泽县下流偏北江中（现属安徽宿松县），形势险厄，古称“海门天柱”、“海门第一关”，有数百石级盘绕上山。其间一天门、龙耳洞、弥陀阁、先月楼、半边塔、界潮祠、梳妆亭、御诗碑、龙角石等胜迹都已“新装”迎客，山顶观大江涌潮也称一绝，1985年辟为安徽重点旅游区。
    现江西省彭泽县有关部门在彭郎矶已重建彭郎亭、观姑亭、龙津寺，并有“小姑彭郎两相依”塑像，使这个风流神话的真善美形象具体化。
    旅行至此，你不免被小姑倩影吸引，留恋惜别，意存盘桓，则不妨旅次乘兴登临，饱餐江山美色。面对不舍昼夜无时或息的逝川，遐想联翩。
