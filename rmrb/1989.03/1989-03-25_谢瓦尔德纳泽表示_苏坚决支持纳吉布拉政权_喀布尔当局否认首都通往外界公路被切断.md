Tass News Agency, Moscow, March 23rd. Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze stated that the Soviet Union firmly supports the Najibullah regime.

Recently, the Afghan civil war has intensified, and Soviet public opinion has shown increased concern over the situation in Afghanistan. It was in this context that Shevardnadze made the above statement in response to a question from a Tass reporter. His remarks were reported by Tass this evening.

The foreign minister said that the Soviet Union made the decision to withdraw troops after considering the cessation of external interference in Afghanistan and the implementation of the Geneva Accords. He believes that what is happening in Afghanistan now encourages those advocating a hardline stance in all hotspots. He emphasized that failure to adhere to the Geneva Accords would cast doubt on further resolution of the Afghan problem.

When asked whether Soviet-provided weapons are fueling the Afghan civil war, Shevardnadze said that if all parties stop providing military aid to the Afghan anti-government forces, the Soviet Union is also prepared to take corresponding measures. However, the Soviet Union will not take unilateral steps.

Regarding the recent tense situation around Kabul, with the sound of cannon fire, Shevardnadze stressed that there is a Soviet embassy in Kabul and many civilian personnel remain, and any attempt to harm their safety will be met with a firm response from the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 24th. Amani, a spokesman for the Afghan Foreign Ministry, denied in a press conference in Kabul yesterday that the roads from Kabul to the outside world had been cut off. He said that two supply convoys from Kabul to the besieged Jalalabad had already arrived.

Amani, when discussing the recent battle for Jalalabad, said that the Mujahideen had fired 2,000 rockets and shells at the outer defenses of the government troops in Jalalabad the day before, but there had been no close combat between the two sides.

    新华社莫斯科３月２３日电  苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽表示，苏联坚决支持纳吉布拉政权。
    最近，阿富汗内战激烈，苏联舆论对阿富汗事态的关注程度较前增强，谢瓦尔德纳泽是在此背景下回答塔斯社记者提问时作以上表示的。他的谈话今晚塔斯社已作报道。
    这位外长说，苏联是在考虑停止从外部干涉阿富汗、日内瓦协议得到遵守的情况下作出撤军决定的。他认为，现在发生在阿富汗的事情正鼓励所有热点地区那些主张采取强硬态度的人。他强调，不遵守日内瓦协议将使进一步解决阿富汗问题成为疑问。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽在回答苏联提供武器是否使阿富汗内战火上加油这一问题时说，如果各方对阿富汗反政府军都停止军援，苏联也准备采取相应措施。但苏联不会单方面采取步骤。
    在谈到喀布尔周围近日炮声轰隆的紧张局势时，谢瓦尔德纳泽强调指出，喀布尔驻有苏联使馆，并留下不少文职人员，任何侵害他们安全的企图都将受到苏联的坚决反击。
    据新华社北京３月２４日电喀布尔政权外交部发言人阿马尼昨天在喀布尔举行的新闻发布会上否认关于喀布尔通往外界的公路被切断的说法，他说，从喀布尔开往贾拉拉巴德的两个运输给养的车队已经抵达被围困的贾拉拉巴德。
    阿马尼在谈到最近贾拉拉巴德的攻防战时说，游击队前天向贾拉拉巴德政府守军外围防线发射了２０００发火箭和炮弹，但双方没有发生近战。
