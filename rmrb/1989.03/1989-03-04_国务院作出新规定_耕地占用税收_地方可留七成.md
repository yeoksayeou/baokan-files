The State Council has issued new regulations. Starting from January 1, 1989, the revenue from the agricultural land use tax will be divided between the central and local governments in a 30:70 ratio, with the central government receiving 30% and local governments receiving 70%. The State Council recently issued a notice emphasizing the importance of strictly enforcing the collection of the agricultural land use tax. All levels of government, ministries, and directly affiliated institutions must pay high attention to the collection of this tax. All land-using units and farmers must cherish the limited arable land resources and pay taxes according to the law for the land they use.

The notice states that the approval for land use must be strictly controlled. The 1989 non-agricultural construction land use plan issued by the State Planning Commission and the State Land Administration must not be exceeded arbitrarily. The financial departments will levy taxes according to the approved land use area and relevant regulations. After adjusting the revenue-sharing ratio, the 20 percentage points relinquished by the central government will go directly to the counties, and neither the provincial nor the municipal governments are allowed to intercept them. The central government's revenue targets must be guaranteed by all regions, and any region that fails to meet the central government's revenue targets due to actual land use must make up the difference from local finances. The uncollected taxes from 1988 must continue to be collected, still following the 50:50 sharing ratio between the central and local governments.

The notice stresses that the scope of tax reductions and exemptions must be strictly controlled. Outside the scope of tax reductions and exemptions stipulated in the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Land Use Tax," no region, department, or individual has the authority to arbitrarily stipulate tax reductions or exemptions.

　　国务院作出新规定
    耕地占用税收  地方可留七成
    本报北京３月３日讯  记者王锦鹄、蒋亚平报道：国务院决定，从今年１月１日起，耕地占用税收入中央和地方的分成比例，由原来的对半分成调整为“倒三七”比例分成，即中央３０％，地方７０％。国务院最近发出通知，要求各级人民政府，各部委、各直属机构高度重视耕地占用税的征收工作；各用地单位和广大农民要十分珍惜有限的耕地资源，对占用的耕地要依法纳税。
    通知指出，各地对占用耕地的审批必须从严掌握，国家计委和国家土地管理局下达的１９８９年非农业建设占用耕地计划不得随意突破，财政部门按核准的耕地占用亩数依照有关规定征税。在调整中央和地方分成比例后，中央让出的２０个百分点给县，省、地两级都不得截留。中央的收入任务，各地必须保证完成，凡实际占用了耕地而完不成上交中央任务的，要用地方财政补足。１９８８年应收未收的税款要继续组织征收，仍按中央、地方对半比例分成。
    通知强调，各地必须从严控制减免范围。在《耕地占用税暂行条例》规定的减免范围之外，任何地区、部门和个人都无权擅自规定减税、免税。
