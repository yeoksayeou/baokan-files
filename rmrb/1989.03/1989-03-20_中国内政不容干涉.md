	China's Internal Affairs Are Not Subject to Interference
	Běn Bào Píng Lùn Yuán

	The violent riots instigated by a few separatist elements in Lhasa have been quelled by the necessary measures taken by the Chinese government to maintain law and order, and the situation has now basically stabilized. At a time when the incident has already subsided, the European Parliament and the U.S. Senate, ignoring China's warnings and negotiations, have both passed resolutions on the so-called "Tibet issue," unreasonably accusing the Chinese government of "violent suppression" and "human rights violations" in Tibet and Lhasa, demanding that China lift the martial law, and even proposing that the European Community countries mediate talks with the Dalai Lama. This is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs. The actions of the European Parliament and the U.S. Senate have provoked strong indignation among the Chinese people, and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has issued a solemn statement refuting these claims. We support this just stance representing the will of the Chinese people.

	Everyone knows that in early March this year, a few separatist elements in Lhasa set fire to cars, smashed shops, and shot at police officers, causing a rare riot in Tibet in the past 30 years. The violent actions of these few individuals seriously disrupted public order and caused significant damage to the lives and property of the people of Lhasa. To ensure the safety of the people and maintain normal social order, the local government ordered the arrest of a few troublemakers and declared martial law in Lhasa. This is a legitimate measure taken by any sovereign state to maintain internal law and order, and there is no question of "military suppression." Are we to allow rioters to create violence and harm the lives and property of the people? Would any sovereign state tolerate such actions? The facts prove that it was precisely because martial law was declared in time that the violence was stopped, Lhasa quickly returned to calm, and the people were able to live and work in peace. The actions taken by the Chinese government this time to maintain national unity are purely internal affairs of China and have been wholeheartedly supported by the broad masses of Tibetan and Han people. The resolutions of the European Parliament and the U.S. Senate have made distorted accusations and unreasonable demands against the Chinese government, and we deeply regret such actions that disregard the norms of international relations.

	It is well known that since the 13th century, Tibet has been an inseparable part of China's territory, and the Tibetan people are members of the Chinese family of 56 ethnic groups. In recent years, the central government has always given special care to the Tibet Autonomous Region, implementing a series of preferential policies, and making significant progress in various aspects. The Tibetan people also enjoy full democratic rights and religious freedom under the protection of the constitution. The Tibet Autonomous Region is becoming more prosperous within the family of the motherland. Therefore, the recent riots in Lhasa are not about human rights, nor are they about ethnic or religious issues. In essence, the core issue is that a few separatist elements want to separate Tibet from the territory of the motherland. Such treacherous acts of splitting the motherland are absolutely unacceptable to the 1 billion Chinese people, including the Tibetan people. We must clearly declare that Tibet's independence is out of the question, semi-independence is out of the question, and disguised independence is also out of the question. This is something we will not waver on. In the annals of the Chinese nation, at any time and place, secession is never popular.

	The further prosperity of Tibet and its opening to the outside world must have a stable and united environment. However, there are always some people internationally who try to use the so-called "Tibet issue" to interfere in China's internal affairs, and a few separatist elements domestically also try to rely on foreign forces to pressure the Chinese government. They attempt to use this method of internal and external coordination to force China to accept their illegal demands and achieve the goal of splitting the motherland. Such despicable attempts will never succeed, whether in the past, present, or future.

	The Chinese government and people have always valued friendly cooperation with the European Parliament and also value friendly relations with the United States. We have also noted that the European Parliament recently passed a resolution supporting the restoration of China's status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and we welcome this. However, we firmly oppose the interference in China's internal affairs by some members of the European Parliament and the U.S. Congress, as it can only hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and damage friendly relations between both sides. We hope that some members of the European Parliament and the U.S. Congress can adhere to the norms of international relations and stop their unwise actions of interfering in China's internal affairs.

　　中国内政不容干涉
    本报评论员
    西藏少数分裂主义分子在拉萨市制造的暴力骚乱，经我国政府采取必要措施，维护法律和秩序，现局势已基本稳定。正当事件业已平静之时，欧洲议会和美国参议院不顾我国的劝阻和交涉，就所谓西藏问题分别通过决议案，无理指责中国政府在西藏和拉萨市采取了“暴力镇压行动”、“侵犯人权”，要求中国方面取消戒严令，甚至提出要欧洲共同体国家进行什么“斡旋”，以与达赖喇嘛谈判。这完全是粗暴干涉中国的内政。欧洲议会和美国参议院的这种行径，已激起了我国人民的强烈愤慨，我全国人大外委会已发表严正声明，予以驳斥。我们支持这一代表中国人民意志的正义立场。
    谁都知道，今年３月上旬，西藏少数分裂主义分子在拉萨街头烧汽车、砸商店、向民警开枪射击，制造了西藏３０年来罕见的一场骚乱。这一小撮人的暴力行动，严重扰乱了社会治安，给拉萨人民的生命财产造成了重大损失。为了保障人民群众的生命安全和维护正常的社会秩序，当地政府下令对极少数肇事者绳之以法，并宣布在拉萨市内实行戒严。这本来是任何一个主权国家为维护内部法律和秩序所采取的正当措施，根本谈不上什么“武力镇压”。难道要我们听任暴徒任意制造暴力骚乱、伤害人民生命财产吗？哪个主权国家会容忍这样做呢？事实恰恰证明，正是由于及时宣布了戒严令，才制止了暴力骚乱，使拉萨迅速恢复了平静，人民群众得以安居乐业。我国政府这次为维护祖国统一而采取的行动纯属中国内政，得到了广大藏、汉族人民的衷心拥护。欧洲议会和美国参议院的决议案对中国政府提出了歪曲事实的指责和毫无道理的要求，我们对于这种无视国际关系准则的作法极为遗憾。　　
    众所周知，西藏自公元１３世纪起就是中国版图上不可分割的组成部分，藏族同胞是中国５６个民族的大家庭之一员。近年来，中央人民政府一直对西藏自治区予以特殊关怀，实施了一系列优惠政策，使西藏自治区在各方面取得了不小的进步，藏族人民也在宪法保护下享有充分的民主权利和宗教信仰自由。西藏自治区在祖国大家庭里正日趋繁荣。因此，拉萨最近发生的骚乱事件既不是什么人权问题，也不是什么民族、宗教问题，说到底，其核心问题是极少数分裂主义分子要把西藏从祖国的领土中分裂出去。这种分裂祖国的背叛行为是包括藏族人民在内的１０亿中国人民所绝对不能答应的。我们必须明确地宣告，西藏独立不行，半独立不行，变相独立也不行，这是一点也不会含糊的。在中华民族的编年史上，无论何时何地，分邦裂国从来都是不得人心的。
    西藏的进一步繁荣与对外开放，必须具备安定团结的环境。但是，目前国际上总有一些人企图利用所谓“西藏问题”染指中国内政，而国内的极少数分裂主义分子也企图仰赖外国势力向中国政府施加压力，他们企图以这种内外呼应的方法迫使中国接受他们的非法要求，以达到分裂祖国的目的。这种卑劣的企图无论过去、现在还是将来，都是不会得逞的。
    中国政府和人民一向珍视同欧洲议会的友好合作关系，也珍视中美之间的友好关系。我们也注意到，近日欧洲议会也通过了决议，支持恢复我国在关贸总协定的地位，对此我们表示欢迎。但是，对于欧洲议会和美国国会中的一些人干涉中国内政的行为，我们是坚决反对的，因为它只能伤害中国人民的感情，损害双方之间的友好关系。我们希望，欧洲议会和美国国会中的某些人士能够遵守国际关系准则，停止干涉中国内政的不智之举。
