My experience in writing critical articles is that one must set aside personal biases, respect news facts, dare to criticize societal ills, and insist on writing with integrity. Over the past 10 years, county, municipal, provincial, and national newspapers and radio stations have published more than 30 of my critical articles. Some of these articles have caused significant reactions in my county.

In the summer of 1986, a leading unit in my county, Suzhuang Village, occupied the school's toilet for two years to build a stage. Hundreds of teachers and students were left without a place to use the restroom. For this, I co-wrote a critical article with others, which was subsequently adopted by several news organizations at the central and provincial levels. How could a leading unit tolerate being criticized? At the time, some county leaders were restless, seizing on minor issues in the article to claim that the report was inaccurate and challenging the news organizations. However, in the end, Suzhuang Village did resolve the issue of the school having no toilets.

In May 1988, an incident occurred at my school where students with lower grades were effectively driven away. I reported this to relevant news organizations, and both the Shanxi Daily and Legal Daily exposed the incident. Because I exposed the school's problems, I faced criticism. The school's displeasure is not to mention, and some county leaders also frowned upon me for tarnishing the county's image. Some even went to the Shanxi Daily to complain about me.

Because of writing critical articles, I have become a well-known "risk-taker" in the county, using my pen to stir up trouble. Some leaders who are happy to report good news but angry to report bad news see it this way. Those who were criticized curse and insult me, and some even send threatening letters. Friends and relatives also advise me to report more good news and less bad news to avoid big trouble. Some people even keep their distance from me. Facing various pressures, my attitude is: stay calm and fearless. I am a Communist Party member. As long as I act uprightly and write articles truthfully, daring to fight against various unhealthy tendencies, I will be without guilt to the Party and the people.

### 面对种种压力  我仍秉公执笔

　　面对种种压力  我仍秉公执笔
    我写批评稿的体会是：抛开私心杂念，尊重新闻事实，敢于抨击时弊，坚持秉公执笔。１０年来，县、市、省、中央级报刊、电台发表我写的批评稿３０多篇，有些批评稿在我县引起很大的反响。
    １９８６年夏初，我县的先进单位苏庄村因修建舞台，占学校厕所长达２年，数百名师生无处上厕所。为此，我与别人合写了一篇批评稿，先后被中央和省里的一些新闻单位采用了。先进单位岂容得抹黑？当时县里一些领导人坐卧不安，他们抓住稿中的一些枝节问题，说报道失实，向新闻单位发难。但最后，苏庄村还是解决了学校无厕所的问题。
    １９８８年５月，我校发生一件变相赶走差等生的事，我向有关新闻单位作了反映，山西日报、法制日报都披露了此事。由于我外扬家丑，因而招致非难。校方反感且不说，县里有关领导人也板起面孔说我给县里抹黑，有人还专程到山西日报社告我的状。
    我因写批评稿，成了闻名全县的用笔杆惹是非的“风险人物”，一些乐于报喜，怒于报忧的领导人更是这样看。被批评者对我诅咒、谩骂，甚至给我写恫吓信。亲朋好友也劝我要多报喜少报忧，以免吃大亏。有的人则对我敬而远之。面对种种压力，我的态度是：一冷静，二不怕。我是个共产党员，只要自己行得正，实事求是地写稿，敢于同各种不正之风作斗争，就无愧于党和人民。
