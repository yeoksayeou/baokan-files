Workers at a Polish factory, who had been on strike demanding significant wage increases, decided to return to work today after being informed that the factory was on the brink of bankruptcy.

On February 28, workers at the Marchelski Cotton Mill in Lodz, a major center of the Polish textile industry, went on strike to demand higher wages. Following the strike, negotiations between the factory manager and the strike committee representatives failed to reach an agreement. The 12-day strike pushed the already loss-making enterprise to the edge of collapse.

According to Polish Television, after being informed of the potential closure of the factory, the factory manager and strike representatives held talks on March 11 to discuss ending the strike. The strikers accepted the wage increase proposal made by the factory manager at the beginning of the strike, which included a monthly wage increase of 15,500 zlotys (approximately $31) and immediate resumption of work. They also agreed to work on holidays to make up for the losses incurred during the strike.

The Polish Press Agency commented that the strikers' decision was "wise and correct." Although their demand for a significant increase in monthly wages was not fully met.

　　要求大幅提薪而罢工　工厂濒于破产
    作出明智抉择即复工　弥补罢工损失
    波一棉纺厂工潮平息
    新华社华沙３月１１日电  （记者汤德乔）波兰一家工厂罢工工人被告知该厂行将倒闭后，今天宣布复工。
    ２月２８日，波兰纺织工业中心罗兹市的马尔赫莱夫斯基棉纺厂工人举行罢工，要求增加工资。事发后，工厂经理与罢工委员会代表进行了谈判，但未获结果。持续１２天的罢工使这家亏损企业濒于破产。
    据波兰电视台报道，在这家工厂被告知可能倒闭后，３月１１日工厂经理同罢工工人代表就结束罢工问题进行谈判。罢工者接受了工厂经理在罢工初期提出的提薪方案，即罢工者月工资提高１５５００兹罗提（折合３１美元）；立即结束罢工；利用假日工作，以弥补罢工造成的损失。
    波通社发表评论指出，罢工者作出的抉择“是明智的和正确的”。尽管他们提出的大幅度提高月工资的要求并没有得到满足。
