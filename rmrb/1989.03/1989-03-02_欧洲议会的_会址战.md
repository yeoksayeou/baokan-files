Title: The "Venue War" of the European Parliament

The European Parliament is the supervisory and advisory body of the European Community, the first international parliament. However, where is its venue? No one can clearly state it. Because at the time of the European Community's establishment, only a temporary regulation was made: the permanent secretariat is in Luxembourg, the various committees and parliamentary groups of the Parliament are in Brussels, Belgium, while plenary sessions must be held in Strasbourg, France. Therefore, for many years, the parliamentarians have had to shuttle between the three cities. When holding monthly meetings, they gather in Strasbourg from all corners of Europe. The thousands of translators, secretaries, technical staff, and document personnel based in Luxembourg, along with tons of documents and office supplies, move en masse to Strasbourg. It is like a "great migration." After the meeting ends, everyone returns to their respective places in the opposite direction.

Obviously, this situation cannot continue. Many people strongly hope for a fixed venue. But opinions on where to choose are difficult to unify. Some say, move to Brussels! The reason is that Brussels has convenient transportation with the outside world, and the Commission, the Council of Ministers, and the permanent correspondents of various countries are all there. Others say, Strasbourg is good, because the facilities are complete here, and it is a symbol of Franco-German reconciliation.

In fact, the venue of the Parliament has been debated for many years without a decision, mainly because France, Luxembourg, and Belgium all want the venue to be in their own country. This way, they can gain the political prestige of being a European capital and also reap economic benefits.

At the end of last year, the Political Affairs Committee of the European Parliament passed a proposal to move the special plenary session to Brussels. This made France panic, because if the proposal is passed, Strasbourg will lose its advantage in the long-term "venue war." Therefore, on the eve of the January general assembly's vote on the proposal, French Minister for European Affairs Edith Cresson and the "Mr. Strasbourg" specially appointed by French Prime Minister visited Strasbourg to lobby, trying to reverse the situation. President Mitterrand also took the field, exceptionally delivering a New Year's address in Strasbourg, in which he also meaningfully referred to Strasbourg as the "capital of Europe."

However, the parliamentarians still passed the aforementioned proposal. The Belgians, eager and quick, immediately sent bulldozers to the construction site of the future European Parliament building in Brussels. The French media lamented "a defeat." To reverse the disadvantage, France is taking active measures to strive to maintain Strasbourg's position as the "capital of Europe." It seems that the "venue war" will not be decided in the short term.

    欧洲议会的“会址战”
    姚立
    欧洲议会是欧洲共同体的监督和咨询机构，是第一个国际性议会。可是它的会址在哪儿呢？谁也难一语说清。因为欧共体在成立之初只作过临时规定：常设秘书处在卢森堡，议会的各个委员会和议会党团设在比利时的布鲁塞尔，而开全体会议则须到法国的斯特拉斯堡市。所以多年来，议员先生们不得不在3个城市之间穿梭奔忙。每月举行会议时，他们便从欧洲各个角落云集斯特拉斯堡。以卢森堡为基地的上千名翻译、秘书、技术人员及资料人员，则拖带着数以吨计的文件和办公用品，浩浩荡荡奔赴斯市。活像一场“大迁徙”。会议结束后，大家又各奔东西，按着逆方向回窝儿。
    显然，常此下去是不行的。不少人强烈希望能有一个固定的会址。但选在何处，意见很难统一。有的说，到布鲁塞尔去！理由是布市与外界的交通方便，而且执委会和部长理事会以及各国常驻记者都在那儿；有的则说，斯特拉斯堡好，因为这里设施还齐全，而且是法—西德和解的象征。
    其实，议会会址多年议而不决，主要原因是：法国、卢森堡和比利时都要把会址设在本国，因为这样既可获得欧洲首都的政治声望，又能捞到经济实惠。
    去年年底，欧洲议会政治委员会通过一项提案，主张议会特别全会改到布鲁塞尔开。这一下，法国慌了手脚，因为此案一旦通过，斯市在多年的“会址战”中将丧失优势。于是，在今年1月大会就提案表决的前夕，法国欧洲事务部长克勒松女士和法国总理专门任命的“斯特拉斯堡先生”特来斯市游说，试图扭转局面。密特朗总统也披挂上阵，破例地在斯特拉斯堡发表了新年祝辞，辞中他还意味深长地将斯市称为“欧洲的首都”。
    不过，议员们还是通过了上述提案。比利时人心急手快，赶紧把推土机开进了布鲁塞尔未来欧洲议员聚会的大厦工地。法国舆论哀叹“吃了败仗”。为了扭转劣势，法国正在采取积极措施，力争保住斯市的“欧洲首都”的地位。看来，“会址战”短期内还难见分晓。
