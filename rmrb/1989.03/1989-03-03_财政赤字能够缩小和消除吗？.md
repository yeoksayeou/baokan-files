Fiscal deficits can be reduced and eliminated? By Huang Juibo

Fiscal revenue and expenditure is the process by which the state collects a portion of social products and then redistributes them to form social demand. Therefore, whether fiscal revenue and expenditure are balanced reflects and constrains the balance between social total demand and total supply. Maintaining fiscal balance with a slight surplus can suppress demand and seek balance between social total supply and demand. Conversely, if expenditure exceeds revenue, resulting in a deficit, it will inevitably widen the gap between social total supply and demand. In the process of rectifying the economic environment and regulating the economic order, implementing a tight fiscal policy to reduce and eliminate deficits is an urgent requirement to curb excessive demand and inflationary trends.

One root cause, three specific reasons

Economic overheating, where social total demand exceeds total supply, is the fundamental cause of noticeable inflation and excessive price increases in economic life, and it is also the main reason for the occurrence of consecutive fiscal deficits in recent years. Since 1985, the economy has been overheating continuously. The scale of fixed asset investment by state-owned enterprises increased by 41% in 1985 compared to the previous year, and then increased by 17% and 16% in 1986 and 1987, respectively. At the same time, the growth of consumption funds has been too fast. The total wage bill for employees increased by 20% and 13% in 1986 and 1987, respectively, both exceeding the growth rate of the national income.

Economic overheating, demand expansion, and price increases have put tremendous pressure on the fiscal system. First, economic overheating has stimulated excessive demand for enterprise funds, forcing continued tax cuts and concessions, and a sharp increase in bank investment loans and enterprise repayment of principal and interest, resulting in a continuous decline in the proportion of enterprise profits remitted to the fiscal system. Taking state-owned industrial enterprises as an example, the proportion of profits remitted to the fiscal system was 52.5% in 1985, 44.5% in 1986, and 37.7% in 1987. Second, the over-speed operation of production has aggravated the shortage of resources and their irrational allocation, as well as the imbalance of product structure, leading to a decline in overall economic efficiency. The proportion of national income in the total social product decreased from 42.4% in 1985 to 40.4% in 1987, a decline of 2 percentage points in two years. Coupled with the loss of price increase income and state tax revenue, it constrained the growth of fiscal revenue. In 1987, fiscal revenue grew by only 3.8% compared to the previous year, while the national income calculated at comparable prices grew by 9.4%, and the retail price index increased by 7.3%, which was actually a negative growth. Third, economic overheating and price increases have pushed up fiscal expenditures, especially various expenditures and subsidies to stabilize prices and ensure people's livelihood, which have grown rapidly. Therefore, despite strict control over expenditures, there is still a shortfall. The continuous fiscal deficits have further widened the gap between social total demand and total supply. Realistically recognizing the causes of fiscal deficits in recent years and their impact on economic life can deepen our understanding of the urgency of rectifying the economic environment and conducting economic adjustments; it can deepen our understanding of the urgency of strictly controlling expenditures and reducing fiscal deficits to curb the imbalance between social total supply and demand.

There is historical experience, great difficulty, and the possibility of resolution

Historical experience shows that in economic adjustments, reducing and eliminating deficits is not only necessary but also possible. The fiscal deficits caused by the "Great Leap Forward" over three years were reduced through efforts to cut expenditures, and after the economy returned to normal development, several years of fiscal balance with a slight surplus were achieved. The huge deficit that occurred in 1979 was also reduced through expenditure cuts, and in 1981, basic balance was achieved despite the decline in fiscal revenue, and later, with the steady development of the economy, fiscal revenue and production grew in tandem, achieving fiscal balance with a slight surplus in 1985.

The process of reducing and eliminating deficits in these two instances has valuable experience. First, cutting fiscal expenditures has achieved significant results. In 1961, fiscal expenditures were cut by 44% compared to the previous year, and in 1962, they were cut by another 17%, achieving a slight surplus that year despite a 12% decline in fiscal revenue compared to the previous year; in 1980, fiscal expenditures were cut by 4.8% compared to the previous year, and in 1981, they were cut by another 8.1%, achieving the commendable result of reducing the huge deficit of 17.06 billion yuan in 1979 to 2.55 billion yuan in 1980 despite fiscal revenue being lower than in 1979. Second, in the context of economic adjustment, the basic balance between total supply and demand was quickly restored, various proportions were adjusted, economic efficiency improved, and fiscal revenue and production grew in tandem. In 1963, industrial production increased by 8.5% compared to the previous year, and fiscal revenue increased by 9.2%; in 1964, industrial production increased by 19.6% compared to the previous year, and fiscal revenue increased by 16.7%; in 1983, industrial production increased by 11.2%, and fiscal revenue increased by 11.1%; in 1984, industrial production increased by 16.3%, and fiscal revenue increased by 20.2%. Third, fiscal policy and monetary policy worked closely together and supported each other. The fiscal and banking sectors cooperated closely to handle various legacy issues well while implementing a dual-tight policy, ensuring the normal needs of enterprise working capital, and bringing the economic operation onto a stable and coordinated development track.

However, it should also be noted that there are some new situations in the current reduction and elimination of deficits, which have increased the difficulty. For example, the contract responsibility system has broken the mechanism of fiscal revenue growing in tandem with production, capping the growth rate of fiscal revenue; the disorder in the distribution order, the widespread and serious phenomenon of enterprises and units eroding state revenue; the obvious inflation, making some fiscal expenditures need to increase with the rise of prices, and the state also needs to use a considerable amount of financial resources to stabilize prices and implement value-preserving savings, etc. All of these indicate that the current fiscal situation is severe. There are great difficulties in both increasing revenue and cutting expenditures. However, we must not only see the difficulties but also strengthen our confidence in overcoming them and, based on the new situation, adopt new strategies to reduce deficits.

The way out: Implement a tight fiscal policy, control expenditures, concentrate funds, and manage finances in accordance with the law

Based on the current situation, to reduce and eliminate deficits, fiscal work must be integrated with deepening reforms, both strictly controlling expenditures and increasing fund supply.

(1) Unify understanding and implement a tight fiscal policy. Historical experience since the founding of the People's Republic has repeatedly proven that the policy of maintaining fiscal balance with a slight surplus is completely correct. The recent "vicious cycle" of economic overheating, excessive demand, credit control failure, fiscal deficits, excessive currency issuance, and inflation also proves that the view of using expansionary monetary policy and deficit financing to stimulate economic growth is untenable and must be abandoned. Only by adhering to the principles of living within one's means and acting within one's capabilities, implementing a tight fiscal policy, and resolutely avoiding over-allocation, can we ensure that the rectification of the economic environment achieves real results.

(2) Strictly control expenditures and tighten the belt for two to three years. In recent years, some localities, departments, and enterprises have arbitrarily drawn funds, blindly competed in construction scale, issued bonuses and subsidies, used public funds for banquets and gifts, and flaunted wealth, inflating demand and exceeding the national economy's capacity, and also burdening various levels of finance with heavy debts. We must strictly enforce financial discipline, strictly control expenditures, and thoroughly correct these practices. Cutting fiscal expenditures not only requires reducing the total demand for funds but also adjusting the expenditure structure, balancing priorities, and treating different expenditures differently. We must also emphasize economic efficiency and resolutely curb extravagance and waste. Newly increased fiscal revenue should mainly be used to support price and wage reforms and necessary expenditures for agriculture, education, and science, while some expenditure items should be significantly reduced compared to the previous year.

(3) Appropriately concentrate funds and reasonably increase fiscal revenue. After ten years of reform and construction, the national economy has achieved significant development, and the state's total financial strength has increased significantly, but the problem of rapid growth in extra-budgetary funds and slow growth in budgetary funds has also emerged. Calculated at comparable levels, the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income was 31.9% in 1979 and is expected to drop to 19.3% in 1988. The state's concentrated financial strength is too small, which is not conducive to ensuring the overall needs of reform and construction, and also weakens the state's macro-control capabilities. Therefore, while strictly controlling expenditures, it is also necessary to open up channels and appropriately concentrate funds. We must adjust the distribution relationship and concentrate extra-budgetary funds in a certain proportion; we must rectify the distribution order, seriously rectify taxation and clean up enterprise price increase income, block various tax evasion and avoidance practices, and recover the lost revenue; we must reform and improve the tax system, concentrate tax management authority, rectify tax exemptions and reductions, and play the role of taxation in regulating production and consumption, regulating social distribution inequities, and regulating the unreasonable price ratios of agricultural products.

(4) Implement legal financial management and harden budget constraints. Currently, the softening of budget constraints is a problem that deserves attention. Every year, after the budget is passed by the people's congresses at various levels, it often changes frequently during execution, and there are also many cases of opening loopholes and issuing vouchers, which is an important reason for the passivity of fiscal work. In the process of rectification, regulation, and reform, we must emphasize legal financial management and strengthen budget constraints. First, we must strengthen the budget concept, and after the budget is passed by the people's congresses at various levels, it has legal effect and cannot be arbitrarily changed. Matters that must be handled in the current year should be carefully considered and properly arranged when reporting and compiling the budget; during budget execution, do not open loopholes for increased expenditures and reduced revenues, and changes that must be made should also go through certain legal procedures. Second, we must strengthen the construction of budget laws and regulations, and the entire process from budget compilation, approval, execution to final accounts should be brought under legal jurisdiction to achieve standardization. Third, we should gradually implement the budget disclosure system. For example, regularly disclosing the budget execution situation to accept public supervision and achieve the democratization of budget management.

    财政赤字能够缩小和消除吗？
    黄菊波
    财政收支是国家把一部分社会产品集中起来，又再分配出去形成社会需求的过程。因而，财政收支是否平衡，成为社会总需求与总供给平衡状态的反映和制约条件。坚持财政收支平衡，略有结余，可以抑制需求，谋求社会总供需之间的平衡；反之，支大于收，发生赤字，必然扩大社会总供需之间的矛盾。在治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序中，实行紧缩的财政政策，压缩和消除赤字，是抑制过旺需求和通货膨胀态势的紧迫要求。
    一个总根子，三个具体原因
    经济过热，社会总需求超过总供给，是造成经济生活中出现明显的通货膨胀，物价上涨幅度过大的根本原因，也是近几年又连续发生赤字的主要原因。1985年以来经济持续过热，全民所有制单位固定资产投资规模在1985年比上年猛增41％的基础上，1986年和1987年分别又比上年增长了17％和16％；同时消费基金也增长过快，职工工资总额1986年和1987年分别比上年增长了20％和13％，都超过了国民生产总值的增长幅度。
    经济过热，需求膨胀，物价上涨，给财政带来了巨大压力。首先经济过热，刺激了企业资金需求过旺，迫使继续减税让利，银行投资贷款和企业还本付息支出剧增，使企业实现利润中上交财政的比重不断下降。以国营工业企业为例，1985年实现利润中上交财政的比重为52.5％，1986年下降为44.5％，1987年又下降为37.7％。其次，生产的超高速运行，加剧了资源的紧缺程度及其配置不合理的趋向，以及产品结构的失衡，导致总体经济效益下降。国民收入占社会总产值的比重，由1985年的42.4％降到1987年的40.4％，两年下降了2个百分点，再加上涨价收入和国家税利的流失，制约了财政收入的增长。1987年财政收入仅比上年增长3.8％，而按可比价格计算的国民生产总值增长9.4％，零售物价指数上升7.3％，实际上是一种负增长。再次，经济过热和物价上涨把财政支出抬了上去，特别是用于平抑物价、保障人民生活的各项支出和补贴迅猛增长。因此，尽管从紧控制支出，仍然入不敷出。财政的连年赤字，又扩大了社会总需求与总供给的矛盾。实事求是地认识近几年来财政赤字的原因及其对经济生活的影响，可以加深我们对治理经济环境、进行经济调整的认识；可以加深我们对严格控制支出，压缩财政赤字，以制约社会总供需失衡的紧迫性的认识。
    有历史的经验，有很大的难度，有解决的可能
    历史经验证明，在经济调整中，缩小和消除赤字不仅是必要的，也是可能的。三年“大跃进”造成的财政赤字，经过努力压缩支出，做到了缩小赤字，并在经济步入正常发展后，实现了连续几年的财政收支平衡，略有结余。1979年发生的巨额赤字，同样通过压缩支出，在财政收入下降、停滞的情况下，1981年实现了基本平衡，以后随着经济的稳步发展，财政收入与生产同步增长，1985年实现了收支平衡，略有结余。
    这两次压缩和消灭赤字的过程有着可贵的经验，一是压缩财政支出取得了显著的成效。1961年财政支出比上年压缩44％，1962年又比上年压缩17％，这一年在财政收入比上年下降12％的情况下实现了略有结余；1980年财政支出比上年压缩4.8％，1981年又比上年压缩8.1％，这一年在财政收入低于1979年的情况下，取得了把1979年的巨额赤字170.6亿元在1980年内压缩到25.5亿元的可喜成绩。二是在经济调整的大气候下，迅速恢复了总供需的基本平衡，调整了各项比例关系，经济效益有所提高，实现了财政收入与生产的同步增长。1963年工业生产比上年增长8.5％，财政收入增长9.2％；1964年工业生产比上年增长19.6％，财政收入增长16.7％；1983年工业生产增长11.2％，财政收入增长11.1％；1984年工业生产增长16.3％，财政收入增长20.2％。三是财政政策和银行政策密切配合、相互支持。财政与银行通力合作，在实行双紧政策的同时，较好地处理了各种遗留问题，保证了企业流动资金的正常需要，使经济运行步入稳定协调发展的轨道。
    但是，也要看到，当前压缩和消除赤字有着一些新的情况，增加了难度。例如承包制打破了财政收入与生产同步增长的机制，包死了财政收入的增长幅度；分配秩序混乱，企业和单位侵蚀国家收入的现象相当普遍和严重；明显的通货膨胀，使有些财政支出需要随物价的上升而有所增长，而且国家还要用相当的财力来平抑物价和实行保值储蓄等等。所有这些，说明我们面临的财政形势是严峻的。在增加收入和压缩支出两个方面都有很大难度。但是，我们既要看到困难，也要增强克服困难的信心，并根据新的情况，采取新的压缩赤字的对策。
    出路：实行紧缩的财政政策，控制支出，集中资金，依法理财
    根据当前实际情况，压缩和消除赤字，要把财政工作的治理、整顿同深化改革结合起来，既要严格控制支出，又要增加资金供给。
    （一）要统一认识，实行紧缩的财政政策。建国以来的历史经验反复证明，坚持财政收支平衡、略有结余的方针是完全正确的。近年来出现的经济过热、需求过旺、信贷失控、财政赤字、货币超量发行、通货膨胀这种“怪圈”，也证明那种用扩张的货币政策和赤字财政来刺激经济增长的观点是站不住脚的，必须摒弃。只有坚持量入为出、量力而行，实行紧缩的财政政策，坚决不搞超分配，才能保证治理经济环境取得切实成效。
    （二）要严格控制支出，过两三年紧日子。近些年来，一些地方、部门、企业乱拉乱扯资金，盲目攀比建设规模，竞相发放奖金、补贴，用公款请客送礼，讲排场、摆阔气，膨胀了需求，超过了国民经济的承受能力，也使各级财政背上了沉重的包袱。要严肃财经纪律，严格控制支出，加以彻底纠正。压缩财政支出，不仅要压缩资金需求总量，而且要调整支出结构，有保有压，区别对待，还要切实讲求经济效益，狠刹奢侈浪费之风。新增加的财政收入，应主要用于支持价格、工资改革和必要的农业、教育、科学支出，有些支出项目则要比上年明显压缩。
    （三）要适当集中资金，合理增加财政收入。经过十年改革和建设，国民经济获得了很大发展，国家总财力有明显的增长，但也出现了预算外资金增长很快、预算内资金增长慢的问题。按可比口径计算，财政收入占国民收入的比重1979年为31.9％，1988年预计降为19.3％。国家集中的财力过少，不利于保证改革和建设的全局需要，也削弱了国家的宏观调控能力。因此，在严格控制支出的同时，还必须开辟财源适当集中资金。要调整分配关系，按一定比例集中预算外资金；要整顿分配秩序，认真整顿税收和清理企业涨价收入，堵塞各种偷漏现象，把流失的收入收回来；要改革和完善税制，集中税收管理权限，整顿减免税，并发挥税收在调节生产和消费、调节社会分配不公、调节农产品不合理比价中的作用。
    （四）要实行依法理财，硬化预算约束。当前，预算约束软化，是一个值得重视的问题。每年预算经过各级人民代表大会通过以后，在执行中往往变动较多，开口子、批条子的情况也不少，这是导致财政工作被动的一个重要原因。在治理、整顿、改革中，必须强调依法治财，强化预算约束。首先，要增强预算的观念，预算经各级人代会通过以后，具有法律效力，不得随意变动。当年必须办的事，应在申报和编制预算时作周密考虑，妥善安排；预算执行中不要再开增支减收的口子，必须变动的也应经过一定的法律程序。其次，要加强预算法规建设，从预算的编制、审定、执行到决算全过程都应纳入法律范围，实现规范化。再次，要逐步实行预算公开制度。例如定期公开预算执行情况，以接受人民监督，实现预算管理民主化。
