	This Poetic and Dreamlike Era
	– Watching the Movie *A Time to Remember*
	Gù Xiáng

	It’s another poem, a cinematic poem.

	Two years ago, I watched the first film directed by one of the directors of this film, Lin Hongtong, titled *Death and the Maiden*. I still can’t forget the old man and the girl lingering at the gates of death, their soulful dialogue imbued with poetic sentiment and charm, their poetic contemplation on the value of life; I can’t forget the frames, shapes, and compositions imbued with poetic rhythm; I can’t forget the yellow-leaf-covered alley, the birch forest bathed in the autumn sun, the delicate, simple large blocks of color, and the smooth, flowing camera movements like clouds and water; I can’t forget that romantic and idealistic poetic style. In *A Time to Remember* (Beijing Youth Film Studio), Lin Hongtong persistently and steadfastly continues his unique artistic exploration, pursuing the poetic art of cinema. What is supplemented is that *A Time to Remember*, compared to the former, has greater entertainment value and has made new progress in exploring the intersection of art and entertainment.

	This is a children’s film. But don’t think it’s just shallow “child’s play.” It has both the charm and imagery of children’s perceptions and a profound layer of meaning and artistic depth. It transcends and blends the worlds of adults and children; it is a stylized children’s film with a high aesthetic taste. It can be said to be suitable for all ages.

	The film is composed of three spaces: the space representing the children’s world, the dream world space, and the space of Lù Fēi’s family. Running through them is emotion and human sentiment, and permeating them is a touching romantic atmosphere.

	The children chat on the ancient observatory, singing the children’s song, “It’s not that I don’t understand, the world changes fast,” with the setting sun’s glow, the contrast between the ancient astronomical instrument and the modern buildings in the background, expressing a strong sense of history; the “candlelight evening” displays the decorations and arrangements, the design of the candlelight and special lighting effects, the religious-style children’s humming, creating a solemn and sacred feeling, all with a romantic and poetic quality. The children’s yearning for the future world, their affirmation of self-worth, is different from that of the “Red-Cloaked Girl.” Their thoughts roam freely, and they have their own thoughts about life.

	If the children’s space creates a romantic world that is dreamlike yet not, then the dream space created by Lù Fēi’s five dreams is an even more poetic and ideal, magical world. Endless fields of fragrant grass, shrouded in a faint morning mist. An ancient banyan tree, lush and towering, hanging countless white birdcages. Lù Fēi in a red shirt listens intently as an old man with a long black beard sings an ancient song under the tree’s shade. Their dialogue reflects the child’s thoughts and pursuit of beauty and nature. The film fully exploits the infectious power of cinema’s comprehensive form. Here, the single-color treatment of green, white, red, and black, natural lighting effects, and the use of long-focus lenses, accompanied by the old and young’s dialogue imbued with the philosophy of man and nature, form a mysterious dreamlike feeling and a sense of harmony with nature, permeated with a poetic atmosphere and mood.

	The children’s space and the dream space mainly rely on the rendering of atmosphere, psychology, sensation, and emotion to create a psychological atmosphere and life interest; through light and shadow, shape, and sound, they form a rhythmic beauty and poetic charm. The space of Lù Fēi’s family, however, carries the main storyline of the entire film. This “real” drama needs to be coordinated and unified with the poetic style of the entire film, which is a significant challenge. The director here not only pursues the poetic indoor lighting effects and shapes but also strives to excavate the poetic essence in life. The return of the Chinese-American cellist Huá Guāng brings imbalance to the tranquility of Lù Fēi’s family, bringing waves of emotion between her father and mother, making Lù Fēi feel uneasy. In front of the advertisement for Huá Guāng’s personal concert, she pops her bubble gum on the advertisement, childishly expressing her discontent with Huá Guāng. But when she unconsciously comes to the concert hall, appreciating Huá Guāng’s *Love for the Homeland* chapter, which is like weeping and yearning, like grievance and longing, like poetry and dreams, she seems to have understood something, vaguely tasting Huá Guāng’s inner emotional world. In the concert hall’s lounge, Lù Fēi meets Huá Guāng, and Lù Fēi gives Huá Guāng a light kiss on the cheek, silently conveying their human communication and understanding of each other’s hearts, conveying the sublime harmony between people. With the children’s participation, the relationship between father and mother is also reconciled, and life returns to its former tranquility and warmth. The family space story is a life world with ideal and romantic colors, poeticized. The poetic style of the entire film is to make the children enter an artistic world of human beauty where their souls are purified and nurtured.

	To speak of the film’s shortcomings and regrets, in terms of art, it is precisely in the handling of some scenes in the family space that are too realistic, and the poetic atmosphere and flavor are slightly weak.

### 这如诗如梦的年华——看电影《多梦时节》

　　这如诗如梦的年华
    ——看电影《多梦时节》
    顾骧
    又是一首诗，电影诗。
    两年前，我看过本片导演之一林洪桐独立执导的第一部影片《死神与少女》。我至今还忘不了在死亡门前徘徊的老人与少女，具有诗的情思与神韵的心灵对话，对生命价值诗意的思考；忘不了被赋予诗的旋律的画面、造型、构图，忘不了那铺满黄叶的林荫小道，秋阳照射下的白桦林，淡雅、单纯的大块面色彩和舒缓、流畅，运动如行云流水的镜头；忘不了那富于理想和浪漫色彩的诗化风格。在《多梦时节》（北京青年电影制片厂）里，林洪桐锲而不舍、执著如一地进行着他个性独特的艺术探索，电影诗化的艺术追求。而弥补欠缺的是，《多梦时节》较之前者，具有更大的观赏性，在探索艺术与娱乐的契合点上，有了新进展。
    这是一部儿童影片。但切莫以为它只是浅白的“小儿科”。它既有儿童情趣和形象的感知，又具有深长的意味层面和艺术意蕴。它超越成人与儿童世界，融和成人与儿童世界，它是一部审美情趣较高的风格化的儿童影片。可说是老少咸宜。
    影片由三个空间组成：表现孩子们世界的空间、梦幻世界的空间与罗菲的家庭空间。贯串其中的是情感、人情，弥漫其中的是一种动人的浪漫气息。
    孩子们在古观象台上“侃大山”，唱着“不是我不明白，这世界变化快”的儿歌，夕阳余晖交映下，古老天象仪与背景上现代建筑的对比，表现出强烈的历史感；“烛光晚会”展现的陈设和布置，烛光的设计和特殊光效，宗教式童声哼唱，造成虔诚的圣洁感，都具有一种理想的浪漫色彩与诗的品格。孩子们对未来世界的憧憬，对自我价值的确认，已不同于“红衣少女”，他们思想自由驰骋，对生活有着自己的思考。
    假如说孩子们的空间，创造了一个似梦非梦的浪漫世界，那么罗菲的五次梦境所营造的梦幻空间，更是一个诗情浓郁的理想、神奇的世界。一望无际的芳草地，泛着蒙蒙晨雾。一棵浓绿蔽天的古老大榕树，悬挂着数不清的白色鸟笼。红衫罗菲在树荫下谛听黑衣长须老人唱一支古老的歌。他们之间的对话，反映了孩子对美、对自然的思考和追求。影片充分发挥了电影综合造型的感染力。在这里，绿、白、红、黑等单色彩处理，自然光效，以及长焦镜头的运用，伴着一老一少蕴含着人与自然哲理的对话，构成一种神秘的梦幻感和大自然的和谐感，渗透着诗的氛围和情调。
    孩子们的空间与梦幻空间，主要靠意境、心理、感觉、情绪的渲染，造成心理氛围和生活情趣；通过光影、造型、声音，构成旋律美、诗情美。而罗菲家庭空间，负载着全片主要故事情节线，这“实”的戏，要与全片诗化风格相协调、统一，是一个不小的难点。导演在这里不仅追求诗一般的内景光效与造型，更致力于挖掘生活中诗的内涵。华裔大提琴家华光的返国，带来罗菲家庭宁静的失衡，带来爸爸与妈妈情感的波澜，使罗菲感到不安。在华光个人作品音乐会广告牌前，她把泡泡糖弹在广告牌上，稚气地发泄对华光的不满。但当她不由自主地来到音乐厅里，品味了华光那如泣如诉，如怨如慕，如诗如梦般的《献给故乡的恋人》的乐章，她似乎领悟到了什么，朦朦胧胧体味到了华光的内心情感世界。在音乐厅休息厅里，罗菲与华光会面，罗菲在华光面颊上轻轻一吻，无言地传达出他们人性的沟通与心灵的理解，传达出人与人之间崇高的和谐感。在孩子参与下，爸爸妈妈关系也得到了和解，生活恢复了往日的平静与温馨。家庭空间的故事，是带有理想色彩、浪漫色彩、诗化了的生活世界。全片诗化风格，是为了使孩子们进入一个心灵受到净化与陶冶的人性美的艺术世界。
    要说影片的不足与遗憾，就艺术而言，也正在家庭空间某些戏处理过实，诗的意境和韵味稍弱。
