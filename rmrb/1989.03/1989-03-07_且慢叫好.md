Title: Hold Your Applause

Recently, I have seen in the newspapers that some departments and units have established "public affairs transparency supervision boxes" to strengthen anti-corruption efforts. I was about to applaud, but upon further thought, I believe it is better to wait and see.

In the past, we often read or heard reports about places setting up these "boxes," and we have applauded them. Unfortunately, we rarely see follow-up reports on them. This is not the fault of the news organizations, because although the public's opinions and suggestions are put into the boxes, the problems have not been solved. No wonder the public sighs when they see the "boxes."

Whether it is a "supervision box" or a "suggestion box," this is not the goal, but merely a means, which still needs to be transformed into actual results. Upper-level leaders should use it to widely listen to the public's voices and wishes, then diagnose and treat the problems, solving the issues within the organization and the public's actual difficulties. This should be the true purpose. If it is used to prop up appearances and deceive superiors and subordinates, even if boxes are set up in every household, what use will they be? I fear they will eventually become wastepaper boxes.

I hope to see follow-up reports about the "public affairs transparency supervision boxes"!

　　且慢叫好
    晓虹
    近来，在报上看到有些部门和单位为加强廉政建设设立“政务公开监督箱”的消息，本欲为之拍手叫好，但略一思忖，又觉得还是等等看为妥。
    过去，我们时常读到或听到一些地方设立这“箱”那“箱”的报道，也曾为它们叫过好。遗憾的是，之后很少见到它们的连续报道。这自然怨不得新闻单位，因为群众的意见、建议虽然装进了箱里，但问题并没有得到解决。难怪群众会望“箱”兴叹了。
    设立“监督箱”也好，“意见箱”也罢，这不是目的，只是一种手段，还有待于转化为实际效果。上级领导通过它广泛听取群众的呼声和愿望，然后对症下药，解决自身存在的问题和群众的实际困难，应该说这才是目的所在。如果用它来支撑门面，欺骗上级和下级，即使挨户设箱又有何用？只怕以后会变成废纸箱。
    但愿能读到关于“政务公开监督箱”的后续报道！
