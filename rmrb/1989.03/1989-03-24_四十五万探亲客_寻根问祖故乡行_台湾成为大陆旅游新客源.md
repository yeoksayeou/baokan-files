		As the Taiwanese authorities gradually relax their policies towards the mainland, the number of Taiwanese visitors returning to their hometowns for family visits and tourism has been increasing rapidly. In 1988, 450,000 visitors entered the mainland, making Taiwan the second-largest source of organized tourists after Japan.

		The characteristics of these visitors include: longer stays, averaging 15 to 21 days; higher spending (including transportation costs), with 13.44% spending over $5,400; a majority of male visitors, with over 70% being men; a significant portion over 50 years old; and a high rate of repeat visits.

		An official from the International Market Development Department of the National Tourism Administration predicts that in the coming years, the number of first-time visitors from Taiwan will see significant growth, and the number of repeat visitors will also be substantial. In addition to family visits and tourism, business travel and youth tourism are also on the rise.

　　四十五万探亲客　寻根问祖故乡行
    台湾成为大陆旅游新客源
    本报北京３月２３日讯  记者刘霄报道：随着台湾当局对大陆政策的逐步放宽，台胞回乡探亲旅游人数增长很快，１９８８年入境４５万人次，在我有组织接待的旅游者中，一跃成为仅次于日本的第二大客源市场。
    来访台胞的特点是：停留时间长，平均为１５天至２１天；支出较高（含交通费），１３．４４％的人花费超过５４００美元；来访者中男性占七成，５０岁以上者居多；再访率高。
    国家旅游局国际市场开发司负责人预计，今后几年，台湾来大陆的初访客会有较大的增长，回头客亦很可观。除了探亲旅游之外，商务旅游和年轻人的观光旅游势头看好。
