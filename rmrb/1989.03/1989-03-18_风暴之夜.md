	Stormy Night
	Yin Xiaoqi

	Under the vast sky, I dare say that on the night of May 3, 1988, everyone was restless. A relentless heatwave had been tormenting people for days, leaving them exhausted and mentally drained. After a day of hard work, lying on a bed that felt like it was covered in fine sand, tossing and turning, unable to sleep.

	In the late night, the wind finally picked up. The moon hid behind the clouds, and though there was no hint of coolness in the air, there was at least a glimmer of hope.

	When the wind came, it was like a caravan of wandering nomads traveling on a rugged mountain road. Horses, carriages, and equipment clattered and bumped, jostling and clanging, creating an array of unbelievable sounds. The caravan drew nearer, and many people were busy, bustling about, unloading timber, breaking glass, creating a lively scene. The pleasant sound of metal clashing seemed to come from heaven, ethereal and mysterious. As the gusts swept through, dry branches and fallen leaves took center stage, soaring through the night sky like messengers on a battlefield, striking fear into the hearts of all who witnessed them.

	Some people woke up, quietly listening to this exquisite symphony; others half-awoke, murmuring, "What's going on?" and then turned over to sleep even more soundly. Ah! The masterpieces of the wind were only fit to be their lullabies. Still, others did not wake up at all, seemingly oblivious to the world around them.

	Suddenly, the heavens and earth were filled with the roar of countless troops, shaking the world to its core. Ears could not distinguish any single sound; everything merged into a vast, irresistible tide.

	In an instant, heavy rain poured down from the sky, fierce arrows of rain pelted the ground, years of pent-up frustration released in a single night, the force of it was awe-inspiring. The tin roofs, once proud and boastful, now became dull drums, humming indistinctly, their former proud resonance turned into flattering drumbeats. Only the humble, unnoticed ditches became strong and brave, guiding the raging torrents to their rightful places.

	At this moment, perhaps someone was dreaming: immersed in the bustling scenes of rural house-building and livestock returning home, or indulging in a lavish banquet, drinking and singing, feasting and reveling. Someone, startled, uttered words of wisdom: this wind, this rain, the principles of living—everything has its measure, neither too much nor too little, to maintain the essence of "moderation." Someone else, with the keen eyes of a hawk, watched this vast scene, observing, enjoying, and appreciating the rare sensations and beauty brought by this extraordinary storm.

	The ancients described the swiftness of Genghis Khan's Mongol cavalry as "coming like a falling sky, departing like a flash of lightning." It is fitting to borrow this phrase. The storm vanished like a falling sky and a flash of lightning as dawn broke.

	Only a few days later did we learn that on May 4, a solar flare had exploded, causing abnormal weather conditions worldwide. Oh! How our social life needs a bit of solar flare explosion to bring more vitality and passion.

　　风暴之夜
    尹小奇
    苍穹下的人们，我敢说在１９８８年５月３日上半夜都躁动不安。残酷的热浪连续几天冲击着人们，使人疲惫不堪、心力憔悴。经历一天劳累躺在好像铺上细沙的床上翻身打滚，辗转难眠。
    下半夜终于起风了，月亮躲进云层，空气中虽然没有一丝凉意，但毕竟是有希望了。
    风来的时候，好像一队游荡漂泊的“大篷车”行进在崎岖山路上，人马道具碰碰磕磕、挤挤攘攘、叮咚咣当发出各种难以置信的声响。车队渐渐近了，很多人在忙碌、喧嚷，卸下木料，摔破玻璃，热闹非凡。悦目的金属撞击声仿佛来自天国，幽幽的、神秘的。疾风过处，枯枝败叶大出风头，它们飞行夜空，俨然驰骋沙场翰海的信使，令人心惊胆战。
    有人醒了，静静聆听这美妙绝伦的交响乐；有人半醒，“怎么回事？”一转身睡得更香，哎！天地间风的杰作只配给他当催眠曲；也有人没醒，看来精神麻木不愧为养身之道。
    突然，乾坤间充塞千军万马，把大地搅得一佛出世，二佛涅槃。耳朵分辨不出任何单一的声音，一切都化为波澜壮阔、锐不可当的潮流、趋势。
    大雨在顷刻间从天而降，愤怒的箭矢密集而强劲地射向地面，多年怨气在一夕发泄，来势之猛令人望而生畏。历来以铜锣自诩的洋铁皮屋顶，却成了一张闷鼓，不知所云地哼哼着，昔日傲岸的清响变成了殷勤献媚的鼓吹。只有平时最为卑贱不起眼的沟壑，变得坚强勇敢，它把咆哮不已的洪流编组列队，输送到该去的地方。
    这时也许有人做着好梦：沉浸在乡村盖房上梁、牛羊归莳的喧腾中，或者正在公费盛宴上纵酒狂歌、饕餮大嚼。有人在虚惊中呼出警世之言：这风、这雨、这做人的道理千头万绪，无过无不及才不失其“中庸”之精义。也有人用鹰隼般锐眼注视这莽莽场景，观察、享受并感激这罕见风暴所带来的快感、美感。
    古人用“来如天坠，去如电逝”来形容成吉思汗蒙古铁骑的行军迅捷。不妨借来一用，风暴在天将亮时天坠电逝了。
    几天之后，才知道５月４日太阳黑子发生了爆炸，造成世界范围的气候异常。天啦！我们的社会生活多么需要来点黑子爆炸，使她有更多活力与激情。
