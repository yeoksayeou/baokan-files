The Southern Tang Dynasty's last emperor, Li Yu, wrote in his poem "The Night of the Crow's Cry": "The flowers in the forest have faded with the spring red. Too hasty. Often regret the cold rain in the morning and the wind at night. Rouge tears. Leave people drunk. When will it be repeated? It is the eternal regret of life that water flows eastward." Unexpectedly, a thousand years later, someone took the words "regret water" from this poem as his pen name. He is Zhang Xinyuan.

Zhang Xinyuan took the name "Zhang Henshui," and his real name was forgotten by people. In January 1938, he traveled via Hankou to Chongqing and lived in a humble thatched cottage at the foot of Jianwen Peak in Taizi Gully, South Hot Springs, beginning his arduous writing career. This humble abode was what Chongqing people called a "partitioned" house, which was surrounded by bamboo strips, with yellow mud filling the gaps, the roof made of thatch and straw tiles, and the rafters tied with bamboo strips. Its shabby appearance was evident.

Chongqing is often foggy, with continuous autumn rain. After a few rains, the house would drip with small raindrops. Zhang Henshui would write while placing large and small basins around the room to catch the water. Whenever the sky was overcast and rain was about to fall, he would be busy, so he jokingly named his residence "Waiting for Leaks Studio." Here, he lived an "self-sufficient" life for eight years, often carrying several dozen pounds of rice back to South Hot Springs from the city, a journey of over forty li. At that time, he was already over 50 years old and had to cook for himself. His manuscript fees were meager, and he was short of money, not buying a single piece of clothing for three years. Seeing the nearby official residence of Kong Xiangxi and Lin Sen's Tingquan Tower, he wrote a couplet and pasted it on the door of his thatched cottage: "Close the door to stop the thousand-li journey," "Across the mountain, people start a half-room hall," with the horizontal inscription: "North Viewing Studio," perhaps taking the meaning of "Wang Anshi's 'Northward exile, tears fill the handkerchief'."

At that time, South Hot Springs had only a very small power plant, and Zhang Henshui's Waiting for Leaks Studio was not qualified to install electric lights. He wrote by candlelight in this humble room, producing eight million characters of novels, short stories, and various essays such as "Mountain Window Sketches," "Madness," "Peaceful Flowers," "Eighty-One Dreams," "Heroes of Central Plains," "Long Live the Tigers," "Difficult Road to Shu," "Biography of a Peddler," and "New Biography of Water Margin," which were published in "Xinmin Daily," "News Daily," "National Public Daily," Hong Kong's "Li Bao," Hankou's "Shen Bao," "Kunming Evening News," and "Travel Magazine," among others.

Zhang Henshui spent eight years in the Waiting for Leaks Studio, averaging about 3,000 characters per day. At that time, life was difficult due to frequent air raids by Japanese planes, and it was not easy to produce so many works. "Eighty-One Dreams" was even reprinted and distributed in Yan'an. Zhou Enlai met with him in Chongqing and fully affirmed his creative career in the Waiting for Leaks Studio.

    待漏斋与八百万字
    陈显涪
    南唐后主李煜有《乌夜啼》云：“林花谢了春红。太匆匆。常恨朝来寒雨夜来风。胭脂泪。留人醉。几时重。自是人生长恨水长东。”没料到一千多年后，有人取此阕词中的“恨水”二字，作为自己的笔名，他就是张心远。
    张心远取名“张恨水”，真名倒被人淡忘。1938年1月他取道汉口来到重庆，住在南温泉建文峰麓桃子沟边一所简陋的茅屋中，开始了艰苦卓绝的笔耕生涯。这座陋舍乃重庆人称呼的那种“夹壁”房子，即四围用竹篾编织，黄泥巴涂抹缝隙，房顶用茅草和稻草做瓦，椽子用竹篾捆绑，其寒酸之态可见一斑。
    重庆多雾，秋雨绵绵。几场雨过后，屋里便滴滴嗒嗒地下起了小雨，张恨水一边写作，一边在房中摆满了大小瓦盆接水。每当阴霾密布，雨水将至之时，他便忙得不亦乐乎，因此自我解嘲，将下榻之地取名为“待漏斋”。在这里，他过了八年的“自给自足”生活，常常扛着几十斤米从城里步行四十多华里返回南温泉，其时已年逾50，还得生火自炊。稿酬微薄，手头拮据，三年未置一件衣物。目睹不远处孔祥熙官邸和林森的听泉楼，他感而写了对联贴在茅屋门口，上联曰：“闭户自停千里足”，下联曰：“隔山人起半间堂”，横批：“北望斋”，许是取陆放翁“北放中原泪满巾”之意。
    当时，南温泉只有一个很小的电厂，张恨水的待漏斋是没有资格安电灯的，他秉烛穷灯，在这间陋屋内写了《山窗小品》、《疯狂》、《太平花》、《八十一梦》、《中原豪侠传》、《虎贲万岁》、《蜀道难》、《负贩列传》、《水?新传》等中、长篇及各种散文八百万字，分别发表在《新民报》、《新闻报》、《国民公报》、香港《立报》、汉口《申报》、《昆明晚报》、《旅行杂志》等。
    张恨水在待漏斋8年，平均每天约写3千字。当时日机空袭，生活艰苦，能创作出这样多作品，殊非易事。《八十一梦》还曾在延安翻版发行，周恩来在重庆接见了他，充分肯定了他在待漏斋中的创作生涯。
