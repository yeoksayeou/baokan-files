Dreams Never Stop
— A Visit to United Technologies Corporation

The title of a documentary film shown to the reporter during a visit to the American "United Technologies Corporation" is "Dreams Never Stop." The film vividly introduces the development of the company's "Sikorsky" aircraft manufacturing plant. The founder of the plant, Sikorsky, had long dreamed of aircraft being able to fly vertically. On September 14, 1939, he finally sat in his homemade simple helicopter and lifted off the ground by a few inches, initially realizing his dream. He and his colleagues were not satisfied and continued to dream of aircraft that could ascend and descend freely in high-altitude flight. Decades have passed. Now, the helicopters they manufacture are at the forefront of the world.

"United Technologies Corporation" is a famous high-tech company in the United States. Although the reporter's visit was brief, it left a deep impression.

The company has always prioritized research and development. In 1987, the total research and development expenditure was $8.97 billion, slightly more than the fixed asset investment of $8.39 billion that year. The company's headquarters has a dedicated "Science Research Center," where over 1,000 scientists and engineers are engaged in major projects. Each subsidiary also has its own research centers, focusing on improving their respective products.

The current focus of the company's research centers includes computer science, advanced materials, advanced propulsion systems, high-temperature superconducting materials, and devices. The company has already applied computers to solve scientific research problems and continues to research many technologies related to artificial intelligence, computer architecture, and supercomputers. To develop the propulsion system for spaceplanes, they are studying supersonic combustion technology and placing photon research in a crucial strategic position. It is not difficult to predict that in many products, photonic instruments and systems will replace conventional electronic devices, thereby improving the measurement and information transmission functions of optical flight systems.

The company is a global enterprise, with over 300 manufacturing plants in 25 countries, totaling $11.9 billion in assets. Its product lines, including industrial control systems, helicopters, military electronic instruments, rocket propulsion systems, and aerospace systems, are popular both domestically and internationally. In 1987, the sales revenue reached $17.2 billion, with a net income of $5.92 billion.

A manager told the reporter, "Facing the fierce competition of the 21st century, our company must continuously research and develop high technologies to maintain the leading position of our products in the global market." The reporter believes that their new dreams will also be realized.

　　梦想永不停止
    ——访美国联合技术公司
    本报记者  刘开宸
    《梦想永不停止》。这是记者参观美国“联合技术公司”时看到的一部电影纪录片的片名。该片生动地介绍了公司“西科尔斯基”飞机制造厂的发展情况。厂的创始人西科尔斯基早年曾梦想飞机能垂直飞行。１９３９年９月１４日，他终于坐上自制的简易直升机，飞离地面数英寸，初步实现了他的梦想。他和同事们并不满足，还梦想飞机能升能降，在高空中进退自如。几十年过去了。现在，他们制造的直升机，在世界上处于领先地位。
    “联合技术公司”是美国著名的高技术公司。记者在一天参观中，虽是“走马看花”，但还是给人留下了深刻印象。
    公司一直把研究、开发放在首位。１９８７年，总的科研费为８．９７亿美元，比同年的固定资产开支８．３９亿美元还多一些。公司总部设有专门“科学研究中心”，１０００多名科学家、工程师在进行重大项目研究，公司下属各系统也设有科研中心，着重改进本系统的产品。
    公司科研中心现在研究的重点项目是电脑科学、先进材料、先进推进器、高温超导材料和器件等。公司已应用电脑来解决科研问题，并继续研究人工智能、电脑结构和超级电脑的许多技术。为发展宇航飞机的推进系统，他们正研究超音速的燃烧技术，还把研究光子放在重要的战略地位，不难预料，在许多产品中光子仪器和系统将代替常规的电子器件，从而改进光导飞行系统的测量和传递信息功能。
    公司是全球性的大企业，在２５个国家内有３００多个制造厂，共有资产１１９亿美元。它的系列产品，如工业控制系统、直升机、军事电子仪器、火箭推进器和宇航系统等，畅销国内外。１９８７年销售额达到１７２亿美元，净收入为５．９２亿美元。
    一位经理对记者说：“面对２１世纪的激烈竞争，我们公司要不断研究、开发高技术，以保持公司产品在世界市场上的领先地位”。记者相信，他们新的“梦想”也会实现的。
