Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 12th.

"Hundred years of wages for one house." This is the lament many people have expressed recently about the commercial housing market that has opened in Beijing. In fact, this is just one track of housing commercialization; another track, where units sell housing to employees at a discounted price, is also being laid.

This is the vision of housing privatization described by an official from the State Council's Housing Reform Office to our reporter.

Housing sold by the real estate industry to society is genuine commercial housing. The price includes all costs such as construction fees, demolition fees, land fees, municipal infrastructure fees, and various taxes, plus the profits of the construction units. In some large cities, the housing price has even reached 2,800 yuan per square meter. Those who rely solely on their wages can only sigh in admiration. However, the large income gap in society is a fact today. The rich have money but no place to live, and they can buy high-end commercial housing. The state has income, the buyer has a home, and consumption funds are diverted, achieving three benefits at once. Otherwise, all the money would be squeezed into the vegetable basket, which is not necessarily a good phenomenon.

The new trend in housing reform has shifted from the past pilot programs of issuing vouchers and rent subsidies based on a certain percentage of wages to the transition of units selling public housing to employees at discounted prices. In Beijing, several pilot units have sold housing to employees, with prices around 200 yuan per square meter, equivalent to the depreciated construction cost. For example, a certain joint venture company purchased commercial housing provided by the market at 2,000 yuan per square meter and then sold it to employees at a discounted price of 200 yuan. After the unit implemented the discounted price, 42% of the public housing in a certain construction company with an average monthly income of 216 yuan for employees has been bought by employees; however, in a certain central department where employees have a monthly income of 120 yuan, only one person has paid a deposit for the sale of existing housing. Due to the lack of a method to raise rents at the same time as selling houses, low-income earners are still observing the unit's discounted housing sales.

It is understood that according to the housing reform plan formulated by the State Council, this year 150 to 200 cities across the country will enter the housing reform ranks. It is estimated that if half of the existing public housing is sold, it can recover more than 200 billion yuan in currency.

    国务院房改办公室负责人说
　　住房私有化将走双轨    
    市场房市场价　单位房优惠价
    今年全国一二百城市进行房改
    新华社北京３月１２日电　（记者李安定）“百年工资一套房。”对于日前在北京开办的商品房市场，不少人发出如此感叹。其实，这只是住房商品化的一条轨，单位建房优惠出售给职工的另一条轨也在铺设中。
    这是国务院房改办负责人向记者描绘的住房私有化前景。
    由房地产行业向社会出售的是货真价实的商品房，房价中土建费、拆迁费、占地费、市政配套费等各种费用税收，加上承建单位的利润全部摊入，个别大城市房价甚至达到每平方米２８００元，仅靠工资收入者对此只有望房兴叹。然而社会收入差距之大已是今日事实，富裕者有钱没房住，买高档商品房，国家有收入，买主有住房，消费资金分流，一举三得。不然钱都挤向菜篮子，也不见得是好现象。
    住房改革的新动向，已从过去试点的按工资的一定比例给予职工发放补贴的发券提租，转向单位以优惠房价出售公房过渡。北京几个试点单位向职工卖房，房价在２００多元一平方米，相当经过折旧的土建费。如某合资公司以每平方米２０００元的价格购买了市场提供的商品房，再以２００元的优惠价卖给职工。单位实行优惠价后，职工月平均收入２１６元的某建筑公司４２％的公房已被职工买去；而在职工月收入１２０元的中央某部出售现有住房，却只有１人缴纳了定金。由于卖房的同时提高租金的办法没有出台，低收入者对单位优惠卖房还在观望。
    据悉：按照国务院制定的房改方案，今年全国１５０至２００个城市将进入住房改革行列。据测算，现有公房只要出售一半便可回笼货币２０００多亿元。
