In the future, all new residential buildings in Shanghai will be equipped with telephone communication facilities, making it more convenient for residents to install telephones. Shanghai is the first major city in the country to implement this practice.

The "Residential Building Telephone Communication Design Standards" compiled by the Shanghai Municipal Telephone Bureau is the first set of design specifications for residential building telephone communications in the country. According to these "Standards," new high-rise and mid-rise residential buildings, as well as multi-story buildings with higher construction standards, will have telephone communication lines installed in every household.

　　上海建住宅　先装电话线
    据新华社上海３月１０日电  今后上海新建住宅将全部敷设电话通讯设施，居民装电话更方便了。上海实行这一做法，在全国大中城市中还属首家。
    由上海市市内电话局编制的《住宅建筑电话通讯设计标准》，是国内第一部住宅建筑电话通讯设计规范。根据这个《标准》，新建高中层住宅及建筑标准较高的多层建筑，电话通讯管路装到每一住户室内。
