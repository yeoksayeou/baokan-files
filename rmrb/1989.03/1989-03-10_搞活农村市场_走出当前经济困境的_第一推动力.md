Title: Revitalizing the Rural Market—The "Primary Driving Force" to Overcome the Current Economic Dilemma

In late January of this year, I went to Liyang County in Jiangsu Province and discussed the current economic situation with the county's Communist Party Secretary, Wu Chunsheng. Many places and enterprises are feeling the pinch of tight funds. At the same time, the printing of currency has not stopped, so I asked, "Where has all the money gone?"

Wu Chunsheng gave a concise answer: "It is estimated that about half of the circulating currency in the country is in the hands of individuals (rural households and individual laborers in urban and rural areas). If we calculate that there are 200 million rural households, and each household has savings of approximately 500 to 1,000 yuan, that would amount to one or two trillion yuan. If about 100 billion yuan of this is not stagnant and circulates through the normal commercial-banking system, then the rural financial system will become active, and other commodity markets will follow suit."

This is a very straightforward and clear line of thought.

How can we make the rural financial market start to move first?

As we all know, the current approach is mainly to raise the interest rates on bank deposits to attract as much of the farmers' idle funds into savings as possible. This policy decision is certainly important, but it is not easy to implement. However, Wu Chunsheng told me that the best and fastest way at present is to release the goods that farmers urgently need and like into the rural market. For example:

1. Agricultural production materials (fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural films, and suitable agricultural machinery, etc.);
2. Building materials, including interior decorations;
3. Various household appliances, especially televisions, and other durable appliances. Although there is a shortage of electricity in rural areas, they are still welcome as decorations and for backup use;
4. Updating rural transportation tools, such as small agricultural trucks and motorcycles;
5. Various novel daily necessities (including clothing, hats, kitchen utensils, etc.).

Once the rural market is activated, everything will follow. The current emphasis on adjusting the structure of industries, enterprises, and products will then have a direction. Otherwise, if we do not adapt to the market, especially if we ignore the changes in the supply and demand relationship of the rural market and continue to subjectively formulate a set of industrial and product policies, we will eventually return to the old model of traditional planned economy for products.

China's rural market is the largest and last major market in the world. Economists and businessmen around the world with foresight are all eyeing this market, which is still largely "blank." For example, if a farmer buys a pair of leather shoes, that would require hundreds of millions of pairs of leather shoes. If each rural household provides one egg per day, that would mean hundreds of millions of eggs on the national market every day. The "vegetable basket" for all urban families every day still relies on the large and small "gardens" in the countryside? The production potential and purchasing power of China's rural areas are immense!

A famous American economist, Professor Theodore W. Schultz, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics, once said that the "primary driving force" of China's reform is rural reform, and thus it has taken the correct path. Now, people are once again discussing how to get China's reform out of the current dilemma. In my opinion, it is still necessary to rely on rural reform as the "primary driving force." In other words, the new round of China's reform should first be to revitalize the rural market on the basis of the household contract responsibility system (i.e., individual ownership by laborers). The rural market we are talking about includes not only the exchange and circulation of commodities (goods), but also the labor market, technology market, capital market, and even the land transfer and leasing market, and so on.

I emphasize the extreme importance of the rural market because the market issue is the dividing line between the new and old economic systems in the reform of the economic system. As long as we affirm and grasp the theme of revitalizing the rural market, many specific problems, difficulties, frictions, and bureaucratic issues, such as the price of agricultural products, the urban-rural commodity network, the organization and management of the rural market, and macro-control, and so on, can be further studied seriously and carefully.

### 搞活农村市场——走出当前经济困境的“第一推动力”

　　搞活农村市场
    ——走出当前经济困境的“第一推动力”
    童大林
    今年１月下旬，我到了江苏溧阳县，同县委书记吴春生谈起了当前经济形势。许多地方、企业都感到资金紧张。同时，钞票的印发又未中断，于是，我问：“钱都到哪里去了？”
    吴春生同志简洁回答我：全国现钞估计有一半在个人（农村家庭、城乡个体劳动者）的手里。农村乡镇以２亿户计算，如每户积款大约５００至１０００元，就有一两千亿元。如果有１０００亿元左右不沉淀而通过正常的商业——银行系统流动起来，那么农村金融系统一活起来，其它商品市场也就活起来了。
    这是一个非常简单明了的思路。
    怎样才能使农村金融市场首先松动起来呢？
    大家知道，现在采取的办法，主要是提高银行的存款利率，企图尽量把农民的沉资吸引到储蓄方面来。这方面的决策当然很重要，实行起来却不很容易。但是吴生同志告诉我，当前最好最快的办法，还是把农民急需的、喜欢的商品投放到农村市场上来。例如：一、农业生产资料（化肥、农药、农膜和适用的农机，等等）；二、建筑材料，包括屋内的装饰品；三、各种家用电器，特别是电视机，其他耐用电器，尽管农村缺电，但作为摆饰和备用，也是受欢迎的；四、农村交通工具的更新，如农用的小型装载汽车、摩托车等；五、各种花样新颖的日用品（包括服装、鞋帽、厨房用具等等）。
    农村市场活起来了，一活百活。现在强调的产业、企业、产品结构的调整也就有了方向。否则，不适应市场，尤其是不顾农村市场的供求关系的变化，而仍然主观地制定一大套产业结构和产品政策，终究还要走回传统的产品计划经济的旧模式中去。
    中国农村市场是全球最大最后的世界市场。全世界有识的经济学家和企业家都盯着这个至今仍然“空白”的大市场。比如说，一个农民购买一双皮鞋，那就需要几亿双皮鞋呵。每一家农户每天提供一个鸡蛋，每天全国市场上就有上亿个鸡蛋。全国城市所有家庭每天的“菜篮子”还不是要靠农村的大大小小“菜园”？中国农村的生产潜力、购买力大着呢！
    美国有位著名的获得过诺贝尔经济学奖的舒尔茨教授说过，中国改革的“第一推动力”是农村改革，因而走上了一条正确的道路。现在人们又都在探讨中国改革如何走出当前困境。依我看来，还是要依靠农村改革这个“第一推动力”。明确地说，新一轮的中国改革，首先就是要在农村家庭承包制（即劳动者个人所有制）的基础上搞活农村市场。我们所说的农村市场，不仅仅是商品（货物）的交换、流通，还要包括劳务市场、技术市场、资金市场，以至土地转让、租赁市场，等等。
    我所以非常强调农村市场的极端重要性，还在于市场问题是经济体制改革中新旧体制的分水岭。只要把搞活农村市场这个大主题肯定了，抓住了，许许多多的具体问题、困难问题、摩擦问题、扯皮问题，诸如农产品价格问题，城乡商品网络问题，农村市场的组织管理和宏观调控问题，等等等等，再进一步认真仔细地研究就是了。
