People's Daily, Tianjin, March 7th

In the context of reducing construction scale and controlling consumption funds, the Tianjin Municipal Government this year insists on spending less and doing more, genuinely serving the people.

At the Tianjin Municipal Government expanded meeting yesterday, 20 good deeds for urban and rural people were approved, with stabilizing prices being the top priority. Planting 1 million trees in the urban area, eliminating dilapidated school buildings in the suburbs, and opening 30,000 new telephone lines within the city... all have been specifically arranged.

In response to this year's situation, Tianjin Mayor Li Ruihuan emphasized that doing good deeds should be combined with rectification, rectification, and deepening reform. He called for mobilizing the masses to participate in voluntary labor, and for leaders and backbones to selflessly dedicate themselves, leaving behind a legacy of hard work and struggle.
