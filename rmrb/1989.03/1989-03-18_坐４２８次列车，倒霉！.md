We had a miserable experience on Train 428.
On January 19, we boarded Train 428 in Jinan. At the "Conductor's Office," we were waiting to purchase tickets. The conductor asked, "Will you need a receipt or not?" He then explained: if we needed a receipt, we would pay the full fare; if not, we would receive a short-distance ticket, and the remaining fare would be exchanged for food. We were puzzled and asked, "Wouldn't you be at a loss?" The conductor replied frankly, "Neither side loses, the country does." One of our colleagues paid 2.7 yuan to purchase a ticket, and the conductor gave a 7 jiao short-distance ticket and some cigarettes and malt sugar. We observed that many passengers on this train exchanged their ticket money for goods.

We also noticed that groups of peddlers did not buy or supplement tickets, instead selling substandard goods on the train. A group selling "high-quality wool coats" priced each coat at 360 yuan and sometimes even insulted the passengers. An old railway worker who frequently took this train said, "There are many people who have been cheated! Some cry, some stomp their feet and curse, but who cares?"

During the journey, although the train's boiler had boiling water, the attendants refused to let passengers draw water, claiming that the boiler was steaming their rice. Thirsty passengers had no choice but to buy the train's milk to quench their thirst. A small plastic cup of diluted milk powder cost 2 jiao, which was quite exploitative! Throughout the journey, the broadcast system did not work, and no one announced the stations, causing passengers who might miss their stop to anxiously ask around. The toilets and washrooms in each car were filthy, with sewage everywhere; many of the lights in the cars were damaged.

Taking this train was indeed a misfortune.

### 坐４２８次列车，倒霉！

　　坐４２８次列车，倒霉！
    １月１９日，我们从济南登上４２８次列车。在“列车长办公席”桌前等着补票。列车长问：“报销不报销？”接着，他向我们解释：报销即照实补票；不报销则给张短途车票，剩余的票价款换成吃的东西相送。我们不解地问：“这样，你们不是吃亏了吗？”列车长直言相答：“双方都不亏，亏的是国家。”我们中的一位同志拿出２．７元钱补票，列车长给了一张７角钱的短途票，又给了香烟、麦芽糖等。我们观察到，在这趟列车上，用补票钱换回东西的旅客颇多。
    我们还发现，成帮结伙的小贩不买票、不补票，随车兜售伪劣商品。一伙卖“高级呢子大衣”的商贩，每件大衣要价３６０元，有时还说一些羞辱旅客人格的话。一位常坐这趟车的铁路老职工说：“上当的人多着哩！上当后有的哭、有的跺脚骂娘，谁管？”
    行车中途，车上锅炉虽烧有开水，乘务员却以锅炉蒸着他们的米饭为由，不让旅客打水。旅客们渴了，不得不买列车上的牛奶解渴。一小塑料杯用奶粉冲的很稀的牛奶卖两角钱，太坑人了！一路上广播没有响过，也没有人报站，怕坐过站的旅客心神不安地到处询问。每节车厢的厕所、洗漱间都脏乱不堪，污水遍地；车厢里的照明灯许多已经损坏。
    坐上这次列车，算是倒了霉。
