The Soviet space program is also undergoing reforms. The astronaut training center, which was previously as secretive as a defense factory, is now open to foreign journalists and will be open to foreign tourists starting in March. The reporter visited this center, located 38 kilometers northeast of Moscow, and witnessed the secrets of the "Star City."

	Positioned on the ground is the orbital complex

	The escort for the tour was the center's director, General Klimuk. According to this general, who has been to space, Star City was established in 1960. Sixty-seven Soviet astronauts have been trained here and have gone to space, with 19 of them having gone twice, 17 three times, and Dzhanibekov having gone five times. The rest have only gone once.

	Star City has 13 buildings and 3,500 residents, housing only military astronauts and their families. Civilian astronauts live in Moscow.

	Klimuk first led the reporters to see the model of the orbital complex, which is composed of the "Peace" orbital station (15 meters long, 4.1 meters in diameter, 20 tons), the "Quantum" laboratory (7 meters long, 4.1 meters in diameter, 12 tons), and two spacecraft. The size, equipment, and color of this model are exactly the same as the actual objects currently in orbit. Astronauts practice operating the equipment on the ground until they are proficient before going to space. Klimuk posed for a photo with the reporters in front of this 36-meter-long behemoth and said that soon two new laboratories will be sent into space to form a "T" shape with the current orbital complex.

	Weightlessness and Overload

	The reporters were then led to the outside of a cylindrical water tank that is 12 meters deep and 23 meters in diameter. Through the porthole, one could see astronauts Solovyov and Serebrov practicing entering and exiting the orbital station and pulling out and opening the solar panels outside the cabin under the guidance of three instructors. Their movements were graceful and unhurried.

	A doctor was already seated in the capsule at the end of the long arm of the centrifuge. As soon as the reporters arrived, the laboratory director pressed a button, and the centrifuge started to spin. The reporter asked, "Can he handle it?" The director said, "Don't worry, this is only three times the force of gravity. Astronauts train at up to ten times the force of gravity and must accurately complete various operations. The maximum overload humans have experienced is 21 times the force of gravity for 1.5 seconds! On April 5, 1975, astronauts Lazarev and Makarov experienced a rocket malfunction during launch, the emergency system activated, and the landing capsule returned to the ground, leaving them unconscious. After recovering, they went to space again." The director pointed to the still-operating centrifuge and said, "This thing can create 30 times the force of gravity. In this situation, a person would definitely die."

	Having a snack in the astronauts' cafeteria

	Astronauts eat 3,000 calories a day in the orbital station. The bread is about half an inch square, one piece per bite, 10 pieces per package. The soup is concentrated and diluted with hot water, while solid foods like steak and meat patties are heated before eating. Klimuk said to the reporters, "Are you hungry?" and then led them to the Star City cafeteria to have snacks, coffee, fruit juice, sandwiches, pies, and fruit cakes... indeed, it was quite refined.

	Next, the reporters also visited the space museum. Initially, due to the limited volume of the launch seats, the height limit for astronauts was 1.72 meters, and the weight limit was 75 kilograms. The first astronaut, Gagarin, was short and stocky, standing only 1.64 meters tall. Now the weight limit is 80 kilograms, and there is no height limit (the Polish astronaut is 1.91 meters tall). The white spacesuit with a reflective visor caught the reporters' attention. This suit weighs 85 kilograms, mostly made of metal, but the sleeves and legs can extend to accommodate people of different heights. When wearing it, one enters through a rectangular door on the back, which has a life support system that can last 6 hours in open space. Last December, due to a mechanical failure, the Soviet-French astronauts took 5 hours and 57 minutes to complete their work, and if it had taken a few more minutes, the oxygen would have run out, which was very dangerous! During space operations, the temperature on the sun-facing side of the suit reaches 140°C, while the shaded side is -140°C, but the temperature inside the suit remains around 25°C. Astronauts wear tight-fitting suits for 8-9 hours a day to compensate for the lack of atmospheric pressure in a weightless state. Since the incident of an astronaut's spacesuit catching fire in pure oxygen, astronauts wear asbestos suits in pure oxygen chambers, which do not self-ignite at 80°C.

	$10 million for a ticket

	Klimuk introduced to the reporters that foreigners who want to go to space first need to spend half a year studying Russian, and then two years training in various aspects, including the life support systems on the spacecraft and orbital station, emergency self-rescue systems, and survival skills after forced landing, whether in the African jungle or the Arctic ice fields, they must be able to survive for 1-2 days until the rescue team arrives. The equipment on the orbital station and the scientific research tasks to be completed must be rehearsed in advance. Of course, some foreign astronauts have lighter tasks, such as the Vietnamese and Afghan astronauts who studied for a year and flew two orbits before returning.

	"Is space travel a money-losing business?" the reporter asked.

	"Not necessarily," Klimuk said. "A rocket costs 2-3 million rubles, and a spacecraft costs 7-8 million. India paid $7.5 million for its astronaut to go to space because just two years of training costs $2 million, the power consumption of the centrifuge is not less than that of a small city, and training for weightlessness requires not only water tanks but also large cargo planes. The Soviet Union generally charges $12-15 million for training a foreign astronaut. The U.S. moon landing program cost $20 billion, but it gained $200 billion in new technology."

	An American pop star has applied several times, offering $10 million, to request that the Soviet space agency let him "hitch a ride to space."

	Starting in March, the Soviet Union will organize foreign tourists for space tourism, including visiting Star City. With new ideas, space travel and the economy are not in conflict.

### 宇航城巡礼

　　宇航城巡礼
    盛世良
    苏联宇航事业也在改革，过去同国防工厂一样保密的宇航员培训中心现在不仅让外国记者参观，而且从３月起将对外国游客开放。记者前天到莫斯科东北３８公里的这个中心，亲眼目睹了“星城”的奥秘。
    　　　　位于地面的轨道联合体
    陪同参观的是培训中心主任克利穆克，据这位上过太空的少将介绍，星城始建于１９６０年，经该中心培训并已上过天的苏联宇航员有６７位，其中１９人两度游环宇，１７人三次上太空，贾尼别科夫５次登天，其余的都只升空一次。
    星城共有１３栋房，３５００居民，只供飞船指令长等军人宇航员及家属居住，文职宇航员都住在莫斯科。
    克利穆克先领记者参观由“和平号”轨道站（长１５米、外径４．１米，重２０吨）、“量子”实验室（长７米，外径４．１米，重１２吨）和两艘飞船串联成的轨道联合体模型。这个模型的尺寸、设备、色彩都同目前在轨道上的实物一模一样。太空人上天前就在地面把操作演练到得心应手的程度。克利穆克在这３６米长的庞然大物前同记者合影时说，很快要把另外两个新的实验室送上天，同目前在太空飞行的联合体作“丁”字形对接。
    　　　　失重与超重
    记者被领到深１２米，直径２３米的圆柱形水舱外。透过舷窗可以看到，太空人索洛维约夫和谢列希罗夫正在３名教练引导下，练习进出轨道站，把绞接式太阳能电池板拖出舱外打开。动作优雅，不慌不忙。
    一位博士研究员已坐在离心加速器长臂顶端的舱内。待记者一到，实验室主任一按电纽，加速器便呼呼地转了起来。记者问：“他受得了吗？”主任说：“放心，这只３倍于重力，太空人训练时最高达１０倍，而且还要准确地完成各项操作。人类经受过的最大超重是１．５秒的２１倍！１９７５年４月５日宇航员拉扎列夫和马卡罗夫起飞时，火箭出故障，应急系统起动，降落舱弹回地面，两人已昏死过去。康复后，他们还上过天。”主任指指还在驱动的加速器说：“这家伙能造成３０倍的超重，人在这种情况下必死无疑。”
    　　　　在太空人餐厅吃点心
    太空人在轨道站吃的是３０００大卡一天的航天餐。面包半寸见方，一口一只，１０只一包。汤是浓缩的，用开水稀释，牛排和肉饼等固体食品则加热后食用。克利穆克对记者说：“肚子饿了吧？”随即领我们到星城餐厅吃点心、喝咖啡、果汗、夹肉面包、馅饼、果料蛋糕……果然吃得很考究。
    接着，记者还参观宇航博物馆。最初，由于起飞座椅体积有限，宇航员身高上限为１．７２米，体重上限为７５公斤。第一名太空人加加林短小精悍，身高仅１．６４米。现在体重上限８０公斤，身高不限（波兰太空人高１．９１米）。带反光面罩的白色太空作业服引起了记者的兴趣。这套衣服重８５公斤，大部分由金属构成，但袖子和裤腿可伸缩，以备不同身高的人使用。穿着时由背部的长方形门钻入，门上是生命维持系统，可供在开放宇宙中活动６小时。去年１２月，由于机械故障，苏法宇航员用了５小时５７分才完成作业，再过几分钟氧气即告尽，真悬！在太空作业时，作业服向阳面温度达１４０℃，背阴面为－１４０℃，但作业服内总是２５℃左右。太空人每天要穿８—９小时的紧身服，以弥补失重状态下缺乏的大气压力。自从发生宇航员在纯氧中衣服着火的惨祸后，纯氧舱内穿的都是石棉服，在８０℃的纯氧中不会自燃。
    　　　　１０００万美元一张票
    克利穆克对记者介绍，外国人想上天，先要用半年时间进修俄语，用２年从事各种训练，其中必不可少的有飞船和轨道站上的维持生命系统、应急自救系统、迫降后的生存本领，不论迫降在非洲莽林还是北极冰原，都要能存活１—２天，以待救生人员赶到。轨道站上的设备，要完成的科研任务，都要事先演练。当然，有的外国宇航员任务较轻，如越南人和阿富汗人学习一年飞两圈就回来了。
    “宇航是赔钱的买卖吧？”记者问。
    “不尽然，”克利穆克说。“一枚火箭二三百万卢布，飞船成本七八百万。印度为让飞行员上天付了７５０万美元，因为仅两年培训即要２００万美元，离心加速器的耗电量不下于一座小城市，训练失重除了在水舱，还要用大型货机。苏联接受一名外国宇航员一般要１２００万—１５００万美元。美国人登月计划耗资２００亿美元，但是，而由此获得的新技术值２０００亿美元。”
    美国一位流行歌星已几次申请，想出１０００万美元，请苏联宇航总局让他“搭便车上天。”
    苏联从３月起组织外国游客作航天旅游，包括参观星城。有了新思维，宇航同经济毫不冲突的。
