The award ceremony for the "Excellent Overseas Chinese Newspaper and News Agency 1988 Olympic Reporting" was held in Guangzhou today. The event was jointly organized by the *People's Daily* Overseas Edition, *Guangzhou Daily*, *Football* Newspaper, and Hong Kong's *Winning* Magazine.

This activity has sparked strong reactions in the domestic and overseas news circles. A total of 28 newspapers and news agencies from both domestic and overseas submitted over 200 articles and more than 170 photographs. Participants and submissions from mainland China and Taiwan accounted for more than half of the total.

The organizing units invited renowned experts from the national news industry to Beijing for a thorough and repeated evaluation. A total of 40-plus gold, silver, bronze, and commendation awards were selected. Chen Zhiyin from Singapore's *Lianhe Zaobao* and Huang Weikang from *China Sports News* won the gold awards for written reports. Lin Ximing from Taipei's *United Daily News* won the gold award for photographic reporting.

This selection activity has built a bridge between domestic and overseas Chinese newspapers and news agencies, especially between the news industries on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, fostering close communication, exchange, and cooperation. Therefore, its significance far exceeds the scope of the selection. During the award ceremony, the chairman of the evaluation committee, deputy editor-in-chief and chief editor of the *People's Daily* Overseas Edition, Yu Huanchun, the vice-chairman of the evaluation committee, general editor of the *Guangzhou Daily*, Huang Yongzhan, and representatives from the sponsoring companies presented certificates and prizes to the winning authors.

The winners from Taiwan were unable to attend due to unforeseen circumstances. They conveyed their greetings and thanks to their friends in the mainland news industry through a phone call to the evaluation committee.
