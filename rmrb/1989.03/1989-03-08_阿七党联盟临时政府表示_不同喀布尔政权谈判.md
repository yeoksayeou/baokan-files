The Afghan Seven-Party Alliance Provisional Government has declared that it will not negotiate with the Kabul regime to resolve the Afghan crisis.

The president of the provisional government, Mujaddidi, stated in an interview with the Frontier Post in Peshawar yesterday that it is impossible for the provisional government to negotiate with the Kabul regime.

In response to the suggestion made by the vice-president of the Kabul regime that if peace could be restored in Afghanistan, President Najibullah would resign, Mujaddidi said, "If Najibullah surrenders without bloodshed, the Afghan Mujahideen will pardon him."

Mujaddidi reiterated his statement made on February 24, "The Afghan Mujahideen have the capability to relocate the provisional government back to Afghanistan within a month."

The Afghan Seven-Party Alliance Provisional Government was established on February 23 in the important Pakistani city of Rawalpindi.

　　阿七党联盟临时政府表示
    不同喀布尔政权谈判
    新华社伊斯兰堡３月７日电  阿富汗７党联盟临时政府总统穆贾迪迪拒绝就解决阿富汗危机问题同喀布尔政权举行谈判。
    穆贾迪迪昨天在白沙瓦向《边疆邮报》发表谈话说，临时政府同喀布尔政权举行谈判是不可能的。
    在回答喀布尔政权副总统提出的、假如能确保阿富汗恢复和平喀布尔政权领导人纳吉布拉将辞职的建议时，阿７党联盟临时政府总统穆贾迪迪说，“如果纳吉布拉在不发生流血的情况下投降，阿富汗圣战者将赦免他。”
    穆贾迪迪重申他２月２４日所说的话，“阿富汗圣战者有能力在一个月之内将临时政府迁回阿富汗”。
    阿富汗７党联盟临时政府是２月２３日在巴基斯坦的重要城市拉瓦尔品第成立的。
