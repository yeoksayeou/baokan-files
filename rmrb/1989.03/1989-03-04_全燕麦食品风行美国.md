Whole oat products are sweeping the United States. The owner of the "Bread Basket" company, Salo, said, "Two years ago, people didn't know what this thing was. In the past, it was used to feed livestock. Now, people are going crazy looking for it." Salo was referring to whole oat flour products. In one week in February, just in Washington D.C., the pastry king, Lidman, sold 72,000 oat bran muffins. The 39-year-old Lidman himself is a living advertisement. In the past, he loved cream-filled chocolates and could eat nearly a kilogram at a time. Fourteen months ago, his weight reached 150 kilograms, and his cholesterol level soared to a frightening 324, which is 124 points higher than the normal standard. The doctor warned, "You are practically a walking corpse." Later, he ate two or three oat bran muffins every day like taking medicine. Soon, his weight significantly decreased, and his cholesterol level dropped to 175.

Lidman discovered that oat products taste good and are beneficial to health. He then invented a fat-free muffin, each containing 16 grams of oat bran, flour, skim milk, protein, and fruit juice. When this muffin was first launched in the spring, no one paid attention to it. By autumn, Lidman's 200 retail stores were booming. Now, companies like "Fields," which has 600 chain stores, and "Health Valley" from California, have all launched oat-based cookies and pastries with various unique ingredients. In the oatmeal market with annual sales reaching $600 million, the sales of whole oatmeal increased by more than nine times last year. The price of half a kilogram of oat bran also rose from less than 40 cents to nearly $2.

Over the past 10 years, more and more Americans have realized the relationship between high cholesterol and heart disease. Whole oat products have emerged in this context. In the best-selling book "Cholesterol 8-Week Cure," author Robert Kowalski wrote that medical research has shown that oat bran fiber can reduce cholesterol levels by 10% to 20%. However, some scientists believe that only by eating 35 grams of oat bran, equivalent to 2-3 muffins, per day can cholesterol be reduced by 3%. Regardless, oats are still a heart-healthy food, and therefore, they are very popular among Americans.

### 全燕麦食品风行美国

　　全燕麦食品风行美国
    本报记者  仓立德
    “面包篮”公司老板萨罗说：“两年前人们还不知这玩意儿是什么，过去它是用来喂牲口的。现在人们发了疯似的找它。”萨罗指的是全燕麦粉食品。在２月的一周内，单是在华盛顿市，糕点大王利德曼便卖掉７．２万只燕麦麸饼。３９岁的利德曼本人便是个活广告。过去他酷爱奶油巧克力点心，一口气能吃掉近１公斤。１４个月前，他的体重升到１５０公斤，胆固醇指数升到吓人的３２４，比正常标准高出１２４。医生警告说：“你简直像个活死人。”后来，他像服药一样每天坚持吃二三只燕麦麸饼，不久，体重明显下降，同时，胆固醇指数降至１７５。
    利德曼发现燕麦食品口感很好，而且有助于健康，于是发明了一种无脂肪松饼，每只含有１６克燕麦麸及面粉、脱脂奶、蛋白和果汁。去年春天，这种饼刚上市时无人问津。到了秋天，利德曼的２００个零售店生意兴隆。现在，拥有６００家连锁商店的“菲尔兹”公司、加州的“健康谷”公司等，纷纷推出了配料各有特色的全燕麦饼干、糕点等。在每年销售额达６亿美元的麦片市场上，全燕麦片的销量去年猛升了９倍多。半公斤的燕麦麸价格也由不到４０美分涨至近２美元。
    过去１０年中，越来越多的美国人认识到高胆固醇与心脏病之间的关系。全燕麦食品正是在这种背景下应运而生的。在畅销的《胆固醇８周疗法》一书中，作者罗伯特·科瓦尔斯基写道，医学研究证明，燕麦麸纤维可使胆固醇水平下降１０％—２０％。但也有的科学家认为，只有每天吃３５克燕麦麸，即２—３只饼，才能使胆固醇减少３％。不管怎么说，燕麦还是一种有益于心脏的健康食品，因此大受美国人的青睐。
