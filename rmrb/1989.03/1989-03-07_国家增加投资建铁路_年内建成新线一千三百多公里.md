Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 6th.

Despite the state's reduction in the scale of construction projects, this year's investment in the construction of the transportation artery, the railway, is still about 4% higher than last year's.

Reporters learned from the Ministry of Railways that this year's railway construction funds are difficult to secure, so the project arrangements must ensure timely completion and the formation of operational capacity. Any overspending due to various factors must be absorbed internally, and wasteful spending must be prevented.

After the initial success of the "North Battle for Daqin, South Attack on Hengyang-Guangzhou" campaign in the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," this year China will accelerate the construction of the railway network in East China and a number of key double-track and electrified railways. The plan is to complete and put into operation 1,320 kilometers of new lines.

To increase transport capacity, the Ministry of Railways will allocate special funds to speed up the construction and renovation of hubs and stations in Xuzhou, Shenyang, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Harbin, Wuhu, Yingkou, and Bayuquan.

According to the introduction, this year's plan is to complete and put into operation 782 kilometers of electrified railways, including segments of the Beitongpu, Guiyun, Chuanqian, and Yingxu lines. The plan also includes the completion of 449 kilometers of double-track railways, with a total of 17 projects on lines such as the Zhegan, Huhang, Jiaoji, and Xulian.

　　国家增加投资建铁路
    年内建成新线一千三百多公里
    新华社北京３月６日电  （实习生姜歆远、记者周宗敏）尽管国家压缩基建规模，但今年对运输大动脉铁路建设的投资，仍然比去年增加了４％左右。
    记者从铁道部获悉，今年铁路建设资金筹措难度很大，因此项目安排要求确保按期投产、形成能力。对各种因素造成的超概算部分要自我消化、防止敞口花钱。　　在“七五”重点战役“北战大秦、南攻衡广”初战告捷后，今年我国将加速华东铁路干线网及一批重点复线和电气化铁路的建设，计划建成投产新线１３２０公里。
    为增加运输能力，铁道部将拨出专款，加紧建设改造徐州、沈阳、天津、石家庄、郑州、哈尔滨、芜湖、营口、鲅鱼圈等枢纽和客站。
    据介绍，今年计划建成投产电气化铁路北同蒲、贵昆、川黔、鹰厦线各段共达７８２公里。建成复线４４９公里，共计有浙赣、沪杭、胶济、徐（州）连（云港）等各线上的１７个项目。
