Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, March 11th.

The new plan proposed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury acknowledges the need to reduce (developing countries') debt, but it has not yet met the aspirations of Latin America. This was the preliminary comment made by Venezuelan President Jaime Lusinchi at the meeting of foreign ministers of the eight-nation Latin American group, regarding the new plan proposed by the United States yesterday to address the debt issue.

Lusinchi said at a press conference in Georgetown that Latin America has not asked for debt forgiveness, but rather hopes that efforts made to solve the debt problem will be recognized. The amounts paid by Latin American countries have allowed creditor banks to reduce the value of the debt and sell these debts at a price far below their nominal value in the secondary market. Therefore, Latin American countries hope that the debt can be reduced to the level of the secondary market. In this way, we can reasonably handle the debt problem without sacrificing our development.

Lusinchi welcomed the fact that the United States and Latin America are beginning to align their positions on the debt issue, expressing that this will lead to a dialogue between Latin America and the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, March 10th.

After U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady announced the "Brady Plan" on March 10th to reduce the external debt of Third World countries and promote economic growth, the Mexican government immediately responded, expressing support for the plan, and considering it the "first positive response" from the United States to a series of proposals made by Mexico over the past three months to address the external debt problem.

　　委内瑞拉总统谈美新债务计划
    要求减少拉美国家债务值 
    墨西哥支持美国“布雷迪计划”
    本报加拉加斯３月１１日电  记者朱满庭报道：美国财政部提出的新计划理解到必需减少（发展中国家的）债务，但是还没有满足拉丁美洲的愿望。这是委内瑞拉总统佩雷斯在出席拉美８国集团外长会议时，对美国昨天提出的新的解决债务问题计划的初步评论。
    佩雷斯在瓜亚那城举行的记者招待会上说，拉丁美洲没有要求豁免债务，而是希望人家看到我们为解决债务问题作出的努力。拉美国家所支付的款项已经使债权银行有可能降低债务值，有可能在二级市场上以大大低于债务名义额的价格出售这些债务。因此，拉美国家希望债务能减少到二级市场的水平上。这样，我们才能合理地处理债务问题而不致牺牲我们的发展。
    佩雷斯欢迎美国与拉丁美洲在债务问题上开始立场接近，表示这将导致拉美与美国的对话。
    新华社墨西哥城３月１０日电　在美国财政部长尼古拉斯·布雷迪１０日宣布了减少第三世界国家外债，促使经济增长的“布雷迪计划”后，墨西哥政府今天立即作出反应，表示支持这一计划，认为这是美国对墨西哥近３个月来提出的一系列解决外债问题的建议的“第一个积极的回答”。
