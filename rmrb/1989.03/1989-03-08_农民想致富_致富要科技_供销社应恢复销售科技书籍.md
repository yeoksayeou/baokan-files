During my investigation in rural areas, I found that many farmers are worried about buying scientific and technical books. Recently, I visited several grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and indeed did not see any scientific and technical books related to agriculture and animal husbandry. In the past few years, supply and marketing cooperatives did sell such books, but because they were not profitable and caused trouble, they were gradually discontinued. This has caused varying degrees of loss to some specialized farming households and farmers growing grain and cotton.

Farmer Chen Wu raised 15 female rabbits last spring, and by now, they have produced over 200 baby rabbits. He wanted to buy a book on rabbit raising. He went to the city bookstore three times and asked others to help him look for it but still could not find it.

The farmers in Zhouzhuang Village have been treating pests for cotton and grain by having a village agricultural technician mix the pesticides in the field. Last summer, the village agricultural technician was away for half a month, and many cotton fields in the village had insufficient pesticide, resulting in damage from pests. A few farming households, when treating sorghum for pests, used too much pesticide and killed many plants. They said, "If we could buy a book that teaches us how to use pesticides, even if it costs 10 yuan per book, we would buy it."

With the development of household farming, farmers are very willing to spend money buying scientific and technical books. To eliminate poverty, one must first eliminate ignorance. Farmers know that scientific and technical books are the "all-purpose guide" and the "living money god." Now, their demand for learning and applying science is stronger than ever. Supply and marketing cooperatives should adapt to this situation, meet their needs, and quickly resume and actively purchase and sell more and better scientific and technical books on agriculture and animal husbandry.

　　农民想致富　致富要科技
    供销社应恢复销售科技书籍
    我在农村调查中见到，不少农民都在为购买科技书籍而发愁。前一阵子走访了部分基层供销社，确实看不到有关农牧方面的科技书籍。前些年供销社曾经销售这类书籍，只因没什么利，又麻烦，就慢慢地被取消了。这样，给农村一些养殖专业户、种粮棉的农民带来了不同程度的损失。
    农民陈五，去年春天饲养１５只母兔，到现在已产仔兔２００多只。他想买一本讲养兔知识的书，他三次去城里书店，又托人四处打听也没有买到。
    周庄村的农民为棉花、粮食治虫害，一直还靠村里的一位农技员到田头配药。去年夏天，村农技员出门半月，村里的不少棉田用药量少，被虫吃掉了。有几家农户为高梁治虫时，因用多了药，烧死了不少。他们说：“只要能买到教咱们怎么用药的书，就是１０元钱１本咱们也买。”
    随着农村家庭养殖业的发展，农户是十分需要、也舍得花钱买科技书的。治穷先治愚。农民晓得科技书是“百事通、活财神”。现在他们学科学、用科学的需求比以往任何时候都强烈。供销社要适应这一形势，满足他们的需求，尽快恢复并积极采购销售更多更好的农牧业科技书籍。
