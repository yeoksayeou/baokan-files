The Foundation of the Ivory Tower
Siwei

If intellectuals engage in pure academic and artistic pursuits, and if the immaculate sanctuary of academia and art is likened to an ivory tower, then China has historically had few places for such a tower to stand.

In feudal times, there's no need to elaborate. Even if scholars occasionally dabbled in scholarship and art, it was mostly as a stepping stone to officialdom or as a pastime for officials. Only official rank could bring wealth, and whether one pursued scholarship or indulged in art, one still needed to eat. The "Poet Saint" Du Fu is said to have written poetry that was "refined through hardship," yet he had already suffered from "hardship and bitterness, his hair turning white with frost." The Ming dynasty scientist Song Yingxing wrote "Tian Gong Kai Wu," but ended up in poverty and distress. Apart from court entertainers, in the two thousand years of feudal society, there was no environment for pure academia and art.

The "May Fourth Movement" was a turning point, bringing modern academia and art with the New Culture Movement. However, repeated national crises and increasingly intense class struggles shattered the academic and artistic dreams of a few intellectuals. When "not even a single peaceful desk could be found in all of North China," talking about an ivory tower would naturally invite criticism from progressive intellectuals.

After the founding of the nation, academia and art gained a healthy and new environment for development. But with the frequent political movements that followed, everything was guided by "class struggle as the key link," and a significant portion of academia and art became political appendages, making it impossible to allow the existence of an ivory tower.

In theory, after a decade of reform and opening up, there should finally be a relatively relaxed academic and artistic environment, allowing the ivory tower of intellectuals to quietly descend. Unfortunately, the sudden surge of the commercial economy directly threatens the ivory tower, putting it in danger of being overturned again.

There is no doubt that the development of socialist commodity economy with planning, and the formation of the market, can provide new driving mechanisms for some academic research and artistic production, and overall, it is beneficial to the creative labor of intellectuals. But the problem also has another side: not all academic achievements and artistic products can be exchanged for money. If all activities are placed on a single scale supported by economic levers, a considerable number of intellectuals will have to change careers to make a living or earn money.

A healthy society should allow everyone to reasonably and legally strive for their own interests, which, in the broader sense, is also for the benefit of the entire society. Most of them are busy with immediate interests. But as part of social division of labor, there must be a few people who transcend immediate interests and care more about the long-term and ultimate interests of the nation and humanity. These are the theoretical intellectuals that any society cannot do without. Their labor results may not be easily converted into money, but they can lead a nation towards prosperity.

Therefore, a far-sighted nation should allow the existence of the ivory tower and create conditions for this small number of intellectuals to transcend immediate gains, to pursue academia for the sake of academia, and to think for the sake of thinking. And for those friends currently wandering at the base of the ivory tower, try not to be tempted by the external stench of money, endure the hardships, and the whole society will recognize and acknowledge your value in due time.

### 象牙塔的立足之地

　　象牙塔的立足之地
    四维
    如果知识分子从事纯学术与艺术的工作，而把那座纤尘不染的圣洁的学术与艺术的殿堂比作象牙塔的话，那么，中国历来就少有象牙塔的立足之地。
    封建时代不必说了，读书人即使偶尔弄弄学问与诗画，也大抵作为做官的进身之阶或者做官的闲暇消遣。因为唯有官阶才能换钱，而无论做学问还是玩艺术，总得吃饱了饭才成吧！“诗圣”杜甫据说写诗“穷而后工”，却早就“艰难苦恨繁霜鬓”；明末科学家宋应星写《天工开物》，终至穷愁潦倒。除了宫廷帮闲，两千多年的封建社会，没有纯学术与艺术的生存环境。
    “五四”是一个转折点，新文化运动带来了近代学术与艺术。然而，一次又一次的民族危亡与越来越白热化的阶级斗争打破了少数知识分子的学术梦与艺术梦。当“华北之大放不下一张平静的书桌”时，侈谈象牙塔，便理所当然地遭到先进知识分子的责难。
    建国后，学术与艺术获得了健康发展的崭新天地。但后来频繁的政治运动一起，一切“以阶级斗争为纲”，相当一部分学术与艺术沦为政治的附庸，也就不可能允许象牙塔的存在。
    照理说，在改革开放十年之后，好不容易有了一个比较宽松的学术环境和艺术环境，知识分子的象牙之塔可以悄然降临了。不料，突如其来的商品经济大潮直逼象牙塔下，它面临着被再度倾覆的危险。
    毫无疑问，社会主义有计划商品经济的发展，市场的形成，可以使部分学术研究与艺术生产获得新的动力机制，从总体上看有利于知识分子的创造性劳动。但问题还有另一面：并不是所有学术成果与艺术产品都能换现钱的。如果把一切活动都置于由经济杠杆支撑的唯一天平之上，有相当一批知识分子就只能改行去谋生或挣钱。
    一个健全的社会，应当让每个人都合理合法地为自己的利益、从总体来说也就是为全社会的利益而努力。他们中的大多数人是为眼前的利益奔忙的。但作为社会分工的一部分，必须有少数人超越眼前的利益，更多地关怀民族与人类的长远利益乃至终极利益。这就是任何社会都不可缺少的一批理论型知识分子。他们的劳动成果难以换现钱，却能引领一个民族走向富强。
    因此，一个有远见的民族应当允许象牙塔的存在，应当创造条件让这部分为数不多的知识分子超越眼前的功利，为学术而学术，为思想而思想。而目前在象牙塔下徘徊的朋友，也尽量不要为外界的铜臭所诱，要耐得冷板凳，全社会认识并承认你的价值为时不会太久的。
