The increase-producing bacteria, jointly developed and promoted by Beijing Agricultural University and the agricultural plant protection system, was tested, demonstrated, and applied on nearly 50 varieties of crops in 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government in 1988, covering an area of 200 million mu. Controlled experiments show that the application of increase-producing bacteria generally increases grain and oil crop yields by about 10%, and vegetable yields by 20-30%, with an input-output ratio of approximately 1:30.

"One egg for a basket of grain" is how farmers in Hunan province evaluate the increase-producing bacteria. The bacteria are inexpensive, costing only 8 jiao per mu; they are easy to use, requiring only two seed treatments and two foliar sprays per year. The promotion of increase-producing bacteria has been included in the Ministry of Agriculture's "Harvest Plan." Fifteen provinces and cities across the country have decided to promote its use.

Increase-producing bacteria were developed by Professor Chen Yanxi of Beijing Agricultural University based on the theory of plant ecological engineering after years of research and were successfully created in 1979. After several years of testing and demonstration, the increase in production has been proven to be significant.

Recently, experts have appraised that this increase-producing bacteria is at the forefront in terms of quality and benefits both domestically and internationally.

　　增产菌名不虚传        
    亿亩田果然增产
    本报北京３月２２日讯  记者陈满正报道：由北京农业大学和农业植保系统联合开发和推广的增产菌，１９８８年在２９个省、自治区、直辖市近５０个品种作物上试验、示范和应用，面积达２亿亩次。对照试验说明，施用增产菌，粮油作物一般增产１０％左右，蔬菜可增产２０—３０％，投入产出比大约为１∶３０。
    “一个鸡蛋换一筐谷”，这是湖南农民对增产菌的评价。增产菌价格便宜，一亩地只需８角钱；使用方便，一个年度只需用增产菌拌种两次喷叶面两次。推广使用增产菌已被列入农业部的“丰收计划”。全国已有１５个省市决定推广。
    增产菌是北京农业大学陈延熙教授根据植物生态工程学理论，经过长期钻研于１９７９年研制成功的。经过几年试验、示范，证明增产效果明显。
    最近，专家鉴定，这种增产菌在质量、效益方面均处于国内外领先地位。
