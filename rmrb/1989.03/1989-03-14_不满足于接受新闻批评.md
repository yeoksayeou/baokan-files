Title: Unsatisfied with Accepting News Criticism

In an era where newspaper criticism is challenging, the Communist Party of China's Xi'an City Committee in Shaanxi Province values the role of public opinion supervision, actively supports media outlets in conducting criticism, and seriously investigates issues exposed and criticized by the media. This is commendable. To stay informed, they have assigned personnel to watch and listen to news daily, established a registration system, and recorded each article criticizing various aspects of the city, promptly supervising relevant departments to address the issues. Compared to some leaders who are untouchable and even retaliate, the Xi'an City Committee's approach is rare and valuable.

However, it must be said that news criticism and public opinion supervision are just one form of criticism and supervision. If party and government agencies rely solely on news criticism to advance their work, there will be significant gaps. For instance, last July, after *People's Daily* and other media outlets reported the incident of farmers in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, having their orchard looted, the city committee secretary wrote a letter asking the county committee secretary and county mayor to take effective measures to resolve the issue. The mayor also rushed to the county to investigate. This is certainly a good thing. However, I have also wondered: what if the media had not reported it? As far as I know, incidents like High Liangzuo's are not isolated in some regions. Some farmers, after being robbed by thugs, appeal from the township to the county, from the county to the city, and from the city to the province, only to encounter "difficulty seeing officials, difficulty getting a response, and difficulty getting things done." They are passed around like a hot potato, with no one taking responsibility. Should the plight of the people only be addressed after it appears in the newspapers?

For a long time, some of our leading agencies have developed a tendency towards laziness and bureaucratic habits, turning a deaf ear to the people's voices. "Even if the people report, the officials do not investigate" has become commonplace. The newspaper where I work receives almost half of its daily mail as complaint letters. A large number of petitions are sent to media outlets, which in itself is a problem: if law enforcement agencies and party and government agencies fulfill their duties, would there be so many complaint letters?

There is a saying now: "Fear the notice, but dread the newspaper." It must be acknowledged that some people "value" news criticism precisely because, under public scrutiny, covering up mistakes only backfires, leading them to take corrective actions.

Of course, the Xi'an City Committee's approach is good, and it is not easy to do so. What I want to say is that our party and government agencies should not be satisfied with just valuing newspaper criticism. The number of issues that can be published in newspapers is extremely small. If we truly want to get the work done, we should look downwards, listen to the people's voices, accept the people's criticisms and suggestions, and resolve more problems before they appear in the media.

　　不满足于接受新闻批评
    秦耕
    在报纸批评比较困难的今天，中共陕西省咸阳市委重视发挥舆论监督作用，积极支持新闻单位开展批评，认真查办新闻单位揭露和批评的问题，值得称道。为了及时掌握情况，他们安排专人每天收看、收听新闻，建立登记制度，把批评本市方方面面的稿件逐件登记，及时督促有关部门查处。与某些老虎屁股摸不得，甚至反咬一口的领导者相比，咸阳市委的做法，难能可贵。
    不过，话说回来，新闻批评和舆论监督只是批评和监督的一种形式。党政机关倘若仅仅借助新闻批评推进工作，那将会产生很大的疏漏。比如说，去年７月，《人民日报》等新闻单位报道了陕西礼泉县农民高良佐承包的果园被哄抢一事后，市委书记为此写信要求县委书记和县长采取有效措施加以解决；市长还赶赴该县进行查处。这当然是好事一桩。不过我也曾想过：假如新闻单位没有报道，将会如何？据我所知，在一些地区，像高良佐这样的事情并非个别。一些果农在遭歹徒洗劫之后，从乡告到县，从县告到市，从市告到省，结果得到的是“人难见，脸难看，事难办”，踢皮球，没人管。对于群众的疾苦难道非要等到见诸报端之后才予以重视和查办么？
    长期以来，我们一些领导机关养成了一种惰性和衙门作风，对群众的呼声充耳不闻，“民虽告，官不纠”，早已司空见惯。笔者所在的报社，每天所收信件几乎有一半是告状信。大量的诉状投向新闻单位，这本身就是一个问题：如果执法部门和党政机关克尽职守，何至于有这许多告状信呢？
    现在有一种说法：不怕通报，就怕见报。不应讳言的是，有些人“重视”新闻批评，实在是由于众目睽睽之下文过饰非只能适得其反，于是才下力纠正。
    当然，咸阳市委的做法是好的，能够这样做就很不容易。我这里想说的是，我们的党政机关不能只以重视报纸上的批评为满足。报纸上能登出来的毕竟极少极少。真要想把工作做好的话，应该眼睛朝下，耳朵贴地，倾听群众的呼声，接受群众的批评建议，将更多的问题解决在见诸新闻媒介之前。
