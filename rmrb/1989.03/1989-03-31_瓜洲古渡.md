	The Ancient Ferry at Guazhou
	One wave
	Once pushed forward the prosperity of the Tang Dynasty
	One small boat
	Again carried away the humiliation of the Song Dynasty
	Merchants, monks, prosperity, and decline all crossed over
	Joy, sorrow, kings, and nobles all crossed over
	The poet's sorrow
	Has dampened the peaks of Wu
	In the eyes of the drunkard, a few stars and fishing boats
	Glory, decay, poetry, and spears...
	Half have gone with the passing water
	Half like sand and soil
	Here they settle and linger
	The modern wind blows green over the south and north of the river
	From the ferry window
	Black Africa and white Europe are seen
	The ancient ferry is once again filled with lush poetic charm
	At night
	The river is adorned with fireworks
	In the spring rain, the ten-thousand-mile Yangtze River is like a green vine
	On which a melon hangs, green and fresh...

　　瓜洲古渡
    一层浪
    曾推来唐的繁华
    一扁舟
    又载去宋的屈辱
    渡商渡僧渡兴渡亡
    渡欢渡忧渡王渡侯
    诗人的愁
    染湿了点点吴山
    醉了的眼里有三两星火渔舟
    光荣、腐朽、诗情、戟钩……
    一半都随了逝水
    一半如沙如土
    在此沉积、淹留
    现代风吹绿了江南江北
    渡轮窗口
    探出黑的非洲白的欧洲
    古渡头又氤氲着葱茏的诗意
    夜晚
    江里火树银花
    春雨中，长江万里绿藤上
    一只瓜又碧绿碧绿……
