Hong Kong singer and actor Xu Xiaoming began a charity performance for the 20 million young people of Guizhou Province on the night of the Lantern Festival. All proceeds from the performance and the income from the recordings of the songs made in Guizhou will be donated to the Guizhou Youth Foundation.

This is the second time Xu Xiaoming has returned to the mainland to dedicate his efforts to the cause of education by holding charity performances to raise funds. The first time was in 1985 when he performed in Beijing.
