Cuba and the U.S. have resumed direct mail service. The Xinhua News Agency reported from Havana on March 21 that the Cuban Postal Service has begun distributing mail and photographs directly from the United States in Havana. This restores postal services between Cuba and the United States, which had been suspended for more than 20 years.

Before the resumption of postal services, mail between Cuba and the United States took 3 to 4 weeks to reach the recipient. Now, it only takes 2 days.

The 1988 U.S. Trade Act, which took effect this February, lifted restrictions on the import and export of mail between Cuba and the United States. Subsequently, Cuba established the Cuban Postal Service, which is responsible for directly distributing mail from the United States.

　　古美恢复直接通邮
    新华社哈瓦那３月２１日电  古巴邮包公司已开始在哈瓦那办理分发直接来自美国的信件和照片。这样，中断了２０多年的古、美两国间的邮政业务又重新恢复。
    在没有恢复邮政业务以前，古、美之间的信件需费时３或４个星期才能抵达收件人手中，而现在只需要２天。
    今年２月生效的１９８８年美国贸易法，取消了古、美间邮件进出口的限制。之后，古巴建立了负责直接分发来自美国信件的古巴邮包公司。
