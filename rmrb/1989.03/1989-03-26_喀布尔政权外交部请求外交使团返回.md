Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, March 25th.

The Foreign Ministry of the Kabul regime issued a statement today, requesting that diplomatic missions that withdrew from Kabul before the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops return and guaranteeing their safety.

According to reports, the government statement was first distributed to the media and will then be formally submitted to the United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. The statement said that some people had feared that Kabul might quickly become a battlefield after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops, but in fact, such a situation has not occurred, and diplomatic missions returning will have no need to worry about their safety.

Currently, only 19 countries' diplomatic missions are operating in Kabul, the majority of which are from the Soviet Union, Eastern European countries, and some neutral countries. The embassies of most Western major countries have been almost entirely closed.

It is reported that the above request from the Kabul government is particularly directed at the United States because "the United States is a guarantor of the Geneva Agreement and can promote the peace process."

　　喀布尔政权外交部请求外交使团返回
    本报伊斯兰堡３月２５日电  记者任毓骏报道：综合当地报纸和外电今天消息，喀布尔政权外交部发表声明，请求在苏联全部撤军前夕撤离的外交使团重返喀布尔并保证其安全。
    据报道，这份政府声明先在新闻界散发，然后将正式送交联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔。声明说，有人曾担心在苏联完全撤军后喀布尔很快可能变成流血的战场，但事实上并没有出现这样的局面，外交使团返回后不必为其安全担忧。
    据统计，目前只有１９个国家的外交使团在喀布尔开门办公，其中绝大多数属于苏联、东欧国家和一些中立国，西方主要国家的使馆几乎全部关闭。
    据报道，喀布尔政府的上述请求特别是针对美国提出的，因为“美国是日内瓦协议的保证国，可以促进和平进程。”
