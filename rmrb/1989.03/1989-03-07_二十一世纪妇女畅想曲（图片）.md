		**A Vision of Women in the 21st Century**

		How will women live in the 21st century? Based on the global trends in science and technology, the American magazine *Whole Earth Review* has made predictions and composed a vision of women in the 21st century. Celebrating one's 150th birthday will no longer be a mere fantasy.

		Sitting in front of a computer, women will perform "heavy labor" as easily as playing the piano.

		By inputting nutritional data into the computer, one can enjoy ideal delicacies.

		Household chores will be significantly reduced, allowing women more time to participate in cultural and sports activities.

		Even after reaching the age of sixty, women will maintain a healthy and beautiful figure, with a back that looks as youthful as a young girl's.

		The "artificial womb" will eliminate the hardship of ten months of pregnancy.
