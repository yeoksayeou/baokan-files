Recently, the head coach of the Chinese table tennis team, Xu Shàofā, revealed a true figure: in recent years, more than 180 Chinese table tennis players have gone abroad through various channels.

With the 40th World Table Tennis Championships approaching, people naturally wonder: will the Chinese team face challenges from their own "overseas army"?

The reporter recently spoke with officials from the Chinese Table Tennis Association and got the impression that the situation is not as severe as some might think. Most of the Chinese table tennis players who have gone abroad will not participate in the World Championships. They can be roughly divided into three categories. The first category is those sent abroad officially, mainly as foreign aid coaches, acting as emissaries to execute cultural exchange agreements between countries. There is also a part sent abroad officially through agreements between the Chinese Table Tennis Association and foreign table tennis associations, earning some benefits for the Chinese Table Tennis Association.

The second category, which is the largest in number, can be called "self-sent." They mainly go abroad through friends' introductions or their own contacts. Most of them study and play table tennis at the same time, earning money to support themselves and their spouses' studies and living expenses. Some mainly earn a living by playing table tennis, similar to foreign professional players, with higher incomes and better living conditions. People like Guō Yuèhuá and Cáo Yànhuá basically fall into this category. They often participate in competitions in Europe, which are mostly invitation tournaments and prize money tournaments, and the athletes represent themselves or their clubs.

The third category consists of a few individuals who have acquired foreign citizenship. They have settled in a place through marriage or joining relatives and changed their citizenship. If they want to represent their current country in international competitions, they must meet the following conditions: first, they can only participate in competitions two years after acquiring new citizenship, and second, they must apply to the International Table Tennis Federation for approval before they can compete. In the World Championships, this type of overseas player may pose a threat to the Chinese team. It is understood that currently, only a few people, such as Dīng Yì and Wáng Xiǎomíng, fall into this category. Dīng Yì, who has joined Austrian citizenship, was originally from Shanghai and was later selected for the August First Sports Team, with average results domestically. Wáng Xiǎomíng was originally a player from Sichuan and has now acquired French citizenship.

Through understanding the above situation, we can know that the so-called "own people fighting own people" will not be the main problem in the 40th World Table Tennis Championships. The biggest obstacle for the Chinese team to win the championship is still the strong teams from Sweden and South Korea.

### 出国选手会“反戈一击”吗？

　　出国选手会“反戈一击”吗？
    前不久，中国乒乓球队总教练许绍发透露了一个真实的数字，近几年我国乒乓球选手通过各种途径出国的已达１８０多人。
    现在第４０届世乒赛临近，人们自然关心这样一个问题：中国队会不会遇到自己的“出国大军”的挑战？
    记者近日与中国乒协官员交谈，得到的印象是：情况还不至于那么严重。大多数出国的我乒乓选手不会参加世乒赛。他们出国大致分为三类情况。第一类是公派，以援外教练为主，作为执行国家间文化交流协定的使者；还有一部分公派的是经由中国乒协与国外乒协达成协议，派出打球，根据协议中国乒协能有一些收益。
    第二类人数最多，就叫“自派”吧，主要是通过朋友介绍或自己联系出去的。他们大部分人边打球边上学，靠打球本领挣些钱供自己及爱人上学、生活；还有一些人主要以打球谋生，与国外职业球员相似，收入较高，生活条件较好。像郭跃华、曹燕华等基本可算这一类。他们在欧洲经常参加比赛，比赛类型多为邀请赛、奖金赛，运动员只代表个人或所属俱乐部。
    第三类是个别已加入外国国籍的选手。他们通过结婚、投靠亲属在当地定居，并转变了国籍。如果他们要代表现在所属国参加世界比赛，须符合以下条件：首先是加入新国籍两年以后才能参赛，其次是要申报国际乒联批准后方许登场。在世乒赛上这类出国的人有可能对中国队构成威胁。据了解，当前属于这一类的仅有丁毅、王晓明等少数几人。加入奥地利籍的丁毅，原是上海人，后被选到八一队，在国内成绩平平。王晓明原是四川队女将，现加入了法国国籍。
    通过了解上述情况，我们可以知道，所谓“自己人打自己人”在第４０届世乒赛不会构成主要问题，中国队夺冠的最大障碍仍是以瑞典和南朝鲜选手为首的几支欧亚劲旅。
