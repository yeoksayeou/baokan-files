    On the Refusal of Entry to Zhuo Siming and the Return of Printed Materials Brought by Liu Qian Shi and Others

    The Relevant Authorities Respond to Journalists' Questions

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 29th - Today, our reporter interviewed officials from the Public Security Bureau's Entry-Exit Management Bureau and the Tianjin Customs regarding the reports from Hong Kong news agencies about the prohibition of Zhuo Siming, a reporter from the Hong Kong magazine "Contention," from entering the mainland and the return of printed materials brought by Liu Qian Shi, the director of the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Union, and others.

    Officials from the Public Security Bureau's Entry-Exit Management Bureau and the Tianjin Customs pointed out that the refusal of entry to Zhuo Siming and the return of printed materials exceeding personal use brought by Liu Qian Shi and others were decisions made by the public security organs and customs in accordance with the law.

    An official from the Public Security Bureau's Entry-Exit Management Bureau explained that Zhuo Siming was sentenced to two years in prison by the Beijing Intermediate People's Court in 1985 for the crime of forging documents. He was released in September 1987 after serving his sentence and returned to Hong Kong. According to Article 15 of the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Chinese Citizens Traveling to Hong Kong or Macao for Private Affairs," those "suspected of engaging in criminal activities" are not allowed to enter the mainland. The Entry-Exit Management Department did not allow Zhuo Siming to enter the mainland when he arrived at Tianjin Airport by plane from Hong Kong at 2 PM on the 28th with Liu Qian Shi and six other Hong Kong residents.

    The official said that for the sake of national security and interests, all countries have regulations prohibiting certain individuals from entering. He emphasized, "The refusal of entry to individuals like Zhuo Siming is an extremely rare occurrence. The mainland's regulations regarding the entry and exit of compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan remain unchanged, and in the future, we will continue to provide convenience."

    An official from the Tianjin Customs, when interviewed by our reporter, said that on the afternoon of the 28th, customs officials at Tianjin Airport found nearly two thousand copies of printed materials such as "Declaration for Democracy and Human Rights," "Petition," and "Open Letter to the National People's Congress" in the luggage of Liu Qian Shi and six others during a legal inspection of the passengers' belongings. Article 28 of the "Customs Law of the People's Republic of China" and Article 4 of the "Customs Regulations on the Management of Printed Materials Carried or Mailed by Individuals into and out of the Country" stipulate that printed materials carried into the country by travelers should be within reasonable quantities for personal use and should be subject to customs supervision.

    The official said that Tianjin Customs, in accordance with the above regulations, decided to return the printed materials exceeding personal use brought by Liu Qian Shi and others and allowed the printed materials within personal use to pass. At dawn on the 29th, Tianjin Customs notified Liu Qian Shi and others, who had already arrived in Beijing, of the return decision by telephone. The return processing is a normal administrative management activity carried out by the customs in accordance with the law, which is beyond reproach. The customs' regulations on the management of printed materials entering and exiting the country apply to all incoming travelers and have been officially published to the public.

　　就拒绝庄思明入境和退运刘千石等人的印刷品事        
    我有关部门答记者问
    新华社北京３月２９日电  本社记者今天就香港新闻机构报道的禁止香港《争鸣》杂志记者庄思明入境和退运香港基督教工业联合会主任刘千石等人带进的印刷品一事访问了公安部出入境管理局和天津海关的负责人。
    公安部出入境管理局和天津海关的负责人指出，禁止庄思明入境和退运刘千石等人带进超出自用范围的印刷品，是我公安机关和海关依法作出的决定。
    公安部出入境管理局负责人介绍说，庄思明１９８５年回内地期间曾因犯有变造证件罪，被北京市中级人民法院依法判处有期徒刑两年，１９８７年９月刑满释放回港。根据《中国公民因私事往来香港地区或者澳门地区的暂行管理办法》第１５条规定，“被认为有可能进行犯罪活动的”不准入境的规定，出入境管理部门在庄思明２８日下午２时同刘千石等６名香港人士一道由香港乘飞机到达天津机场时，没有准许他入境。
    这位负责人说，为了国家的安全和利益，世界各国都有禁止某些人入境的规定。他强调说：“像庄思明这样不准入境的只是极个别现象。大陆对香港、澳门和台湾的同胞出入境的有关规定不变，今后仍将给予方便。”
    天津海关的负责人在接受本社记者采访时说，２８日下午，天津机场的海关人员在依法检查旅客携带物品时，发现刘千石等６人的行李中，带有“争取民主人权声明”、“请愿书”、“致人大公开信”等印刷品近两千份。《中华人民共和国海关法》第２８条和《海关对个人携带和邮寄印刷品进出境管理规定》第４条规定，旅客携带进境的印刷品应以自用、合理数量为限，并应接受海关监管。
    这位官员说，天津海关根据上述法令规定，决定对刘千石等人超出自用范围的印刷品予以退运出境，对他们自用范围的印刷品予以放行。２９日凌晨，天津海关将退运决定以电话通知已到达北京的刘千石等人。退运处理是海关依法执行的正常行政管理活动，是无可非议的。海关关于印刷品进出境管理的规定，对所有进境旅客都适用，这是早已对外正式公布了的。
