The oil and gas exploration project in the western part of the Taiwan Strait, specifically in the Fujian sea area, has recently commenced. A reconnaissance team from the South China Sea Geological Survey Command has already entered this sea area to begin preliminary work. In recent years, the South China Sea Geological Survey Command has discovered several sedimentary basins along the Fujian coast, including the Jinjiang, Jiulongjiang, and Hanjiang basins, which have the potential for oil formation. According to marine geology experts, these depressions have large spatial scales, which are favorable for the generation and storage of oil and gas, making them promising areas for oil and gas exploration.

    福建海域勘察油气田
    据新华社福州三月一日电　（通讯员郑国平）台湾海峡西部福建海域寻找油气勘察项目最近开始实施。日前，南海地质调查指挥部一支先遣队已进入这个海域开始先期工作。近年来，南海地质调查指挥部在福建沿海发现有成油条件的晋江、九龙江、韩江沉积盆地。据海洋地质专家分析，这几处凹陷空间规模较大，有利于油气的生成和储存，是良好的油气远景区。
