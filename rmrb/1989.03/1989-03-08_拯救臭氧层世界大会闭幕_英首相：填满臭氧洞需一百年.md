The Ozone Layer Protection Conference in London concluded today. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in her closing speech, called on all nations to take joint action to protect the ozone layer.

Thatcher said that the depletion of the ozone layer is causing global climate changes that threaten everyone. If everyone wants protection, then all countries in the world should take unified action. She said that even if all harmful chemicals were banned tomorrow, it would still take 100 years to fill the ozone holes that have already been depleted.

In discussing the responsibilities of developed countries and their expectations for developing countries, Thatcher said, "I realize that some countries hope to reduce and stop the damage to the ozone layer without strictly limiting their own economic development. It is clearly unacceptable for some countries, which are mainly responsible for the problems we face and have already industrialized, to expect other countries to sacrifice the ideals and living standards of their people to pay the same price for protecting the ozone layer."

　　拯救臭氧层世界大会闭幕
    英首相：填满臭氧洞需一百年
    本报伦敦３月７日电  记者陈特安报道：英国首相撒切尔夫人今天上午在拯救臭氧层伦敦会议闭幕式上发表讲话，呼吁每个国家共同采取行动，保护臭氧层。
    撒切尔夫人说，臭氧层的流蚀引起了全球性气候的变化，将危及到每个人。如果所有的人都想得到保护的话，那么，世界上所有国家都应一致行动起来。她说，即使所有有害的化学物品明天就被禁止，也还将要花费１００年的时间才能把已流蚀的臭氧洞填满。
    在谈到发达国家的责任及对发展中国家的希望时，撒切尔夫人说，我意识到一些国家希望在减少和停止对臭氧层的破坏的同时，将不会严格限制它们国家的经济发展。一些对造成我们面临的大部分问题负有主要责任并且已经工业化了的国家期望其他国家牺牲本国人民的理想和生活水平，为保护臭氧层付出同样的代价，这显然是不能允许的。
