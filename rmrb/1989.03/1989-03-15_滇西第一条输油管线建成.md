The first oil pipeline in western Yunnan was completed and began supplying oil today. This pipeline starts in Luofeng County in the south and ends in Xiangyun County in the north, stretching 200 kilometers in length. It has an annual oil transport capacity of approximately 180,000 tons. Western Yunnan lacks railway lines and air routes, and all mechanical and vehicular fuel must be transported by oil tankers. Previously, one-fifth of the vehicles constantly shuttling on the roads were oil tankers. The completion of the oil pipeline significantly shortens the oil transport distance.

　　滇西第一条输油管线建成
    新华社昆明３月１４日电  （记者段建勋）滇西第一条输油管线今日竣工供油。这条输油管线南起禄丰县，北终祥云县，全长２００公里，年输油量约１８万吨。滇西没有铁路线，也没有航空线，机械、车辆用油全靠运油车拉运。过去公路上穿梭不停的车辆有１／５是油罐车。输油管线的建成，大大缩短了运油路程。
