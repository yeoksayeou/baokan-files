		Industrial production maintained a certain growth rate in the first two months of this year, but structural contradictions have become more pronounced. According to statistics from the State Statistical Bureau, the national industrial output value for February was 8.41 billion yuan, an increase of 7.5% compared to the same month last year. Of this, the light industry output value was 4.27 billion yuan, up 7.8%, and the heavy industry output value was 4.14 billion yuan, up 7.2%. The total industrial output value for state-owned enterprises was 5.42 billion yuan, up 1.8%, and for collectively-owned enterprises, it was 2.67 billion yuan, up 17.6%.

		From January to February, the national industrial output value totaled 18.18 billion yuan, an increase of 8% compared to the same period last year. Of this, light industry grew by 7.9%, and heavy industry by 8.1%. Among light industrial products, long-line products such as bicycles, sewing machines, and radios continued to see reduced production. A few durable consumer goods, such as color televisions, refrigerators, and electric fans, maintained relatively rapid growth. However, due to constraints on energy, particularly electricity, the production of most raw materials declined, and the production of agricultural support products was also sluggish.

		To meet the requirements of reducing the scale of basic construction, ensuring effective supply, and adjusting the production structure, it is necessary to take concrete measures to boost electricity production, organize the supply of raw materials and electricity for light textile products, and ensure the production of agricultural support materials. The key to boosting electricity production is to focus on coal production and organize the transportation of coal. For light textile products and agricultural support products, it is essential to guarantee the supply of electricity, raw materials, and funds to stabilize the market and ensure the normal progress of spring farming.

　　工业生产保持增长
    结构矛盾依然突出
    本报讯  据国家统计局资料，今年头两个月工业生产虽保持了一定的增长速度，但结构性矛盾进一步突出。今年２月份全国完成工业总产值８４１亿元，比去年同月增长７．５％。其中，轻工业产值４２７亿元，增长７．８％，重工业产值４１４亿元，增长７．２％。全民所有制工业总产值５４２亿元，增长１．８％，集体所有制工业总产值２６７亿元，增长１７．６％。
    １至２月份，全国共完成工业总产值１８１８亿元，比去年同期增长８％。其中轻工业增长７．９％，重工业增长８．１％。轻工产品中，自行车、缝纫机、收音机等长线产品继续减产；少数耐用消费品，如彩色电视机、电冰箱、电风扇等仍保持较快增长。但是，受能源、特别是电力不足制约，大部分原材料生产下降，支农产品的生产也不景气。
    从压缩基本建设规模、保证有效供给、调整生产结构的要求来看，当前应采取切实措施，把电力生产保上去，组织好轻纺产品生产的原材料和电力供应，保证农用生产资料的生产。抓电力，首要的是抓煤炭生产，同时还要组织好煤炭的运输。对轻纺产品、支农产品应在电力、原材料和资金供应上加以保证，以利稳定市场和确保春耕生产正常进行。
