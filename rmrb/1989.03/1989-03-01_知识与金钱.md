Knowledge and Money

    According to reports, a university student in Zhejiang who was excellent in both academics and character published a marriage advertisement and received a letter from a young woman: "Studying is hard, studying is busy, what use is studying? Those who hold a pen are no better than beggars. People like you are the most unlucky in the world. Purely making a joke of university students. Culture cannot be eaten, ideals cannot be spent. Nowadays, girls eat RMB. Those like you who have a pen but no RMB can only marry a 50-year-old woman. If you marry a wife in the future, I advise your children not to go to university. Finishing primary school is enough. Now there are computers, advise them to sell soft-shell turtles, then they will become billionaires."

    I don't know if there really is such a young woman who wrote such a harsh letter, perhaps it was made up by some man. In any case, it indeed reflects a social mentality—"studying is useless": where in the books is there a "beauty"? The beauty humiliates the scholar.

    Although the university student was spoken of so poorly, yet millions of middle school students are still competing to enter university. Some parents tighten their belts to send their children to self-funded universities. It is known that a self-funded student costs one or two hundred thousand yuan! It is said that now in China, 1 out of every 7 university students is a self-funded student. This again shows that university still has a great attraction.

    On one hand, there is an example of a university student being humiliated in a marriage advertisement, on the other hand, university has a great attraction, seemingly there is an inexplicable contradiction between the two. In fact, with a little analysis, one can see the complex relationship between knowledge and money: the girl who "eats RMB" values money, students go to university to gain knowledge, knowledge is not equal to money, or rather, the amount of knowledge is not directly proportional to the amount of money, so the girl who "eats RMB" does not want to marry a university student. Someone has spoken bluntly, what is called "studying is useless," in fact, is that studying does not bring money.

    Knowing that studying does not bring money or brings little money, yet so many young people are competing to enter university, how can this phenomenon be explained? Is it to obtain a diploma and seek a position? Is it to secure an "iron rice bowl" that is not good to eat but will not starve? Those who have this kind of purpose in going to university cannot be said to be nonexistent, but the majority of people go to university to learn knowledge. Knowledge is ultimately useful. However, the imbalance between this knowledge and money will obviously affect students' enthusiasm for pursuing knowledge, and it is even more unfavorable for the transformation of knowledge into money—not only the remuneration that knowledge workers should receive for their labor, but also related to the increase of social wealth and the improvement of the living standards of all the people.

### 知识与金钱

　　知识与金钱
    李德民
    据报载：浙江一位品学兼优的大学生刊登征婚广告后，收到一位姑娘的来信：“读书苦，读书忙，读书有啥用场？像你握着笔杆的，不如讨饭，像你这种全世界顶背时的背时鬼，纯粹给大学生闹笑话。文化当不了饭吃，理想当不了钱花。现在的姑娘都吃人民币，像你这种有笔杆，没有人民币的，只有娶个５０岁的老太婆。如果你今后娶上老婆，劝你的儿女不要上大学，读到小学五年级够了，现在都有计算机，劝他卖甲鱼，那时他就成亿元户了。”
    我不知道是否真有这样一位姑娘写出这样一封用语刻薄的来信，也许是哪位男士杜撰出来的。不管怎样，它确实反映了一种社会心态——“读书无用”：书中哪有什么“颜如玉”？“颜如玉”把书生羞辱了一番。
    尽管那位大学生被说得如此寒碜，可是，千百万中学生还在争着考大学，有些家长勒紧腰带供孩子自费上大学，须知一个自费生要花一两万元啊！据说现在我国７名大学生中就有１名自费生。这又表明，大学还是有巨大的吸引力的。
    一个例子是大学生征婚被羞辱，另一方面又是大学具有巨大吸引力，两者之间似乎有着难以解释的矛盾。其实，略作分析，可以看出其中知识与金钱的复杂关系：“吃人民币”的姑娘看重金钱，学生上大学得到知识，知识不等于金钱，或者说知识的多少与金钱的多少不成正比，所以，“吃人民币”的姑娘不愿下嫁大学生。有人把话说穿了，所谓“读书无用”，其实是读书无钱。
    明知读书无钱或钱不多，却有那么多青年争着进大学，这种现象又怎么解释？是为了混张文凭谋个一官半职？是为了端上个吃不好也饿不死的“铁饭碗”？抱着这类目的上大学的不能说没有，但大多数人上大学还是为了学知识。知识终究是有用的。但是，这知识与金钱之间的比例失调，显然会影响学生追求知识的积极性，更不利于知识转化为金钱——不只是知识分子的劳动应取得的报酬，还关系着整个社会财富的增加，全体人民生活水平的提高。
