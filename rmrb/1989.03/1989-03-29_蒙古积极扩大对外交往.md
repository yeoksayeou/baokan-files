Mongolia is actively expanding its foreign exchanges.

March in the Mongolian plateau is in the windy season; traditionally, this is not the tourist season. However, tickets for the international train between Beijing and Ulaanbaatar need to be booked several weeks in advance. This reflects, to some extent, the expansion of Mongolia's exchanges with the outside world.

Mongolia is the largest landlocked country in the world. Although it has established diplomatic relations with over 100 countries, it has long had close ties with only a few, while its exchanges with most other countries have been minimal. Therefore, the world has always had a sense of mystery about Mongolia.

Today, as Foreign Minister Gombosuren has said, the Mongolian government "while ensuring participation in the international socialist division of labor, has begun to implement a policy of reasonably participating in the world economy, especially in economic ties with the Asian region." In the hotel where the reporter is staying in Ulaanbaatar, guests from all over the world, including businessmen, diplomats, and architects from the United States, West Germany, Britain, Czechoslovakia, Japan, Pakistan, and others, come and go. The corridors and dining rooms are filled with the rhythms of multiple languages. In this atmosphere, one cannot help but feel the vitality of Mongolia's expanded foreign exchanges and openness.

Of course, friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) has been, and still is, the cornerstone of Mongolia's foreign policy. Over the decades, economic aid and technological cooperation from the Soviet Union and CMEA member countries have played a huge role in Mongolia's economic and social development. In 1988, 90% of Mongolia's total foreign trade was conducted with the Soviet Union and CMEA member countries.

However, in recent years, with the easing of international relations, the Soviet Union and CMEA countries have shifted their focus to domestic reforms, and Mongolia's cooperative relations with them have undergone some adjustments. For example, Mongolia and the Soviet Union have agreed that Soviet troops stationed in Mongolia will be largely withdrawn within two years; the more than 22,000 experts working in Mongolia will also be withdrawn by 75% within two years. Economic cooperation will also shift from aid-based to joint ventures and joint operations. Even in the area of aid, it will shift from "turnkey projects" to Mongolia building its own projects with equipment provided by the Soviet Union. Additionally, the two countries will improve their settlement systems to enhance the efficiency of economic cooperation.

During visits and meetings, from central government departments to provincial and county leaders, there is a strong interest in normalizing relations with China and developing economic cooperation between the two countries. Deputy Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Otov believes that the prospects for developing economic and trade relations between the two neighboring countries, China and Mongolia, are very broad, with great potential in the development of natural resources, processing manufacturing, and Sino-Mongolian medical cooperation.

At the same time, Mongolia is taking active steps to develop relations with other Asian countries. In recent years, Mongolian leaders or high-level delegations have visited countries such as North Korea, India, Japan, Nepal, and Malaysia in the Asia-Pacific region, and have received visits from North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, Indian President Venkata Raman, and Lao leader Kaysone Phomvihane, bringing bilateral relations with these countries to a new stage.

In 1987, Mongolia established diplomatic relations with the United States. In September 1987, Ulaanbaatar held its first roundtable conference with British and Mongolian scholars, business leaders, and government officials to discuss Mongolia's expanded exchanges with the West. Currently, Mongolia has begun exchanging scholars and sending students to study in countries like Britain and the United States. Mongolian Television has launched English language teaching programs.

Mongolia's exchanges with the outside world are increasing, and the mysterious veil over Mongolia is gradually lifting. The blue sky, white clouds, grasslands, and herds—the enchanting scenery of the Mongolian plateau attracts tourists from afar, and Mongolia will gradually join the process of global economic cooperation.

　　蒙古积极扩大对外交往
    本报记者  丹林
    ３月的蒙古高原，正值风季；按惯例，这不是旅游季节。然而，往返北京—乌兰巴托的国际列车客票，却要提前几周才能订到。这从一个侧面反映了蒙古与外部世界交往的扩大。
    蒙古是世界上最大的内陆国家。它虽与１００多国建立有外交关系，但长期只与少数国家往来较多，同其它大多数国家交往甚少，因此，世人对蒙古总有一种神秘感。
    如今，正如贡布苏伦外长所说：蒙古政府“在确保参与国际社会主义分工的同时，开始实行合理地参与世界经济，尤其是亚洲地区经济联系的方针”。在记者下榻的乌兰巴托饭店，来自世界各地的游客和实业家、外交家和建筑师进进出出，他们来自美国、西德、英国、捷克斯洛伐克、日本、巴基斯坦……走廊上、餐厅里荡漾着多国语言的韵律，在这种气氛中，人们不能不感受到蒙古扩大对外交往与开放的活力。
    当然，与苏联和经互会成员国间的友好合作，过去是、现在仍然是蒙古对外政策的基石。几十年来，苏联与经互会成员国提供的经济援助与技术合作对蒙古的经济社会发展起过巨大的作用。１９８８年蒙古对外贸易总额中９０％是在同苏联及经互会成员国之间进行的。
    然而，近年来随着国际关系出现缓和趋势，苏联与经互会国家重点转向国内改革，蒙古与它们的合作关系也出现某些调整。例如，蒙苏商定：驻蒙苏军将在两年内大部撤走；在蒙工作的２．２万余名专家两年内也将撤走７５％。经济合作也将由援助为主向合资、合营为主的形式过渡；即使在援助方面也将由“交钥匙工程”转向由苏联提供设备、蒙古自行建造的形式。此外，两国间将完善结算制度以提高经济合作效益。
    访问会见中，从中央部委到省县领导人对中蒙关系正常化与发展两国经济合作关系都表现出强烈兴趣。外经部副部长奥托布认为，中蒙两个邻国间发展经贸合作关系前途极为宽广，在开发自然资源加工制造业以及中蒙医合作等方面都大有可为。
    与此同时，蒙古还采取积极步骤发展与其它亚洲国家的关系。过去几年中，蒙古领导人或高级代表团访问了朝鲜、印度、日本、尼泊尔、马来西亚等亚太国家，接待了朝鲜领导人金日成、印度总统文卡塔拉曼、老挝领导人凯山·丰威汉的访问，使蒙古与这些国家的双边关系发展到一个新的阶段。
    １９８７年，蒙古与美国建立了外交关系。１９８７年９月，乌兰巴托首次举行了英蒙学者、企业界领导人和政府官员的圆桌会议，探讨蒙古扩大与西方交往等问题。目前，蒙古已开始与英美等西方国家交换学者和互派留学生。蒙古电视台已推出英语教学节目。
    蒙古与外部世界的交往在增加，笼罩蒙古的神秘面纱正在消失。蓝天、白云、草场、畜群——迷人的蒙古高原景色吸引着不远万里而来的各国游客，而蒙古也将逐渐加入世界经济合作的进程。
