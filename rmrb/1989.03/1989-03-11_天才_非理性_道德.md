Title: Genius, Irrationality, and Morality
Author: Fang Fei

Edition: 5

The Zhejiang People's Publishing House recently released several new books, each with distinctive features worth noting. *Genius and Outstanding Achievements* begins by stating, "In the 2000-year history, the topic of genius, due to facts and fantasies, truths and fallacies, reverence and fear, as well as appreciation, has become quite confusing." This book starts with an imaginative essay on genius and outlines the development and current state of the field of creative social psychology. The editor, Robert S. Albert, claims to have removed personal biases and included articles with differing viewpoints. For instance, on the topic of genius, the book includes both the "genetic determinism" theory and the "social environment influence" theory. As for the editor himself, he holds a moderate view, believing that creativity should not be seen primarily as a quality, ability, or creation of an individual. The development and behavior of outstanding individuals "are supported by the triple helix of family, education, and profession."

Creative social psychology is a new and popular field. This book will be helpful not only to domestic experts and scholars in psychology and education but also to many ambitious university students, despite the current trend of "book learning is useless" spreading in university campuses. The famous mathematician Hardy writes at the end of this book: "A person's primary responsibility, a young person's primary responsibility, is to have aspirations. Aspirations are a noble passion, and they generally take many forms... but the highest aspiration is the one that leaves behind something of eternal value for people."

For today's university students, the philosopher Ernst Cassirer is not an unfamiliar name. His translated work, *An Essay on Man*, was quite popular in university campuses a few years ago. Recently, his *The Myth of the State* has also been published in Chinese. This is Cassirer's last work, written between 1943 and 1945. Although he had left Europe, which was shrouded in the clouds of war, and was teaching at an American university, he still closely followed this world war that brought calamity to humanity. In this book, he examines the history of Western political thought and points out that while people maintain a rational attitude in the field of natural science, the social and political domain of humans is often ruled by irrational mystical forces, which is the root of the political myth. In his view, the rampage of fascism and irrationalism in the field of thought and culture are not unrelated. Cassirer hopes for the rational scientific spirit of humanity, thereby controlling and eliminating the myths in human political and social life, and rebuilding human culture.

*Moral Value Theory* is a work of ethics that explores the fundamental questions of good and evil and how to be a good person. For university students, this issue is indeed of utmost importance. Today's university students have a strong sense of self, unprecedented in history. However, accompanying the awakening of self-awareness is often a sense of self-loss, falling into what is called a humanistic crisis. The author, Shang Ge Ling, believes that "the main manifestation of the contemporary humanistic crisis is the split of human nature and the loss of self, so the effort to solve this crisis is first and foremost a moral effort... rebuilding the value system."

### 天才·非理性·道德

　　天才·非理性·道德
    浙江人民出版社最近推出几种新书，颇有特色，值得一读。《天才和杰出成就》一书开门见山地指出：“在２０００年的历史中，天才这个课题由于事实和幻想，真理和谬误，敬畏和恐惧，还有欣赏，已变得扑朔迷离。”这本书从关于天才的一篇富有想象力的随笔开始，概述了创造性社会心理学这一学科的发展过程和现状。主编罗伯特·Ｓ·艾伯特自陈他力求去除个人偏见，兼收不同观点的文章。如在天才问题上，既收入“遗传决定论”说，也包括“社会环境影响论”。至于主编本人，持的是折衷态度，认为不能把创造性设想为主要是某个个人的特质、能力或创造，杰出人物的发展和行为“受到家庭、教育和职业这个三重螺旋体的支撑”。
    创造性社会心理学是一门新兴且热门的学科。此书不但对国内的心理学、教育学专家、学者有所帮助，对诸多志存高远的大学生也是颇有价值的，虽说时下大学校园里“读书无用论”正在不胫而走。著名数学家哈迪在本书末写道：“一个人的首要职责，一位年青人的首要职责，无论如何是有抱负。抱负是一种崇高的激情，它一般情况下采取许多种形式……但最崇高的抱负是那种为人们留下某种含有永恒价值的东西的抱负。”
    对当今大学生来说，哲学家恩斯特·卡西尔不是一个陌生的名字。他的《人论》一书中译本几年前在大学校园很是流行过一阵子。最近，他的《国家的神话》中译本亦已问世。这是卡西尔生前最后一部著作，写于１９４３年至１９４５年间。其实他虽已远离战争乌云笼罩的欧洲，执教于美国大学，但仍密切关注着这场给人类带来浩劫的世界大战。在这本书中，他考察了西方政治思想史，指出人虽然在自然科学领域中持理性态度，而人的社会政治领域却常为非理性的神秘力量统治，这正是政治神话产生的根源。在他看来，法西斯的肆虐和思想文化领域的非理性主义是不无关系的。卡西尔寄希望于人们的理性科学精神，由此制服、杜绝人类政治社会生活中的神话，重建人类文化。
    《道德价值论》是一本伦理学著作，探讨的是何为善恶、怎样做人的大问题。这个问题对于大学生而言，实在是重要之至的。今日大学生自我意识之强，确为前所未有。然而伴随自我意识的觉醒而来的又往往是种种自我失落感，陷入所谓人文危机。作者商戈令认为“当代人文危机的表现主要是人性的分裂和自我的失落，那么解决这一危机的努力，便首先是道德上的努力。……重建价值体系。”
