The arts community has strongly advocated that, given the proliferation of commercial films, it is urgent to create conditions for the survival and development of high-quality art films. To this end, two art cinemas in Shanghai will soon open. Eleven art cinemas will also be established in nine major cities across the country in the near future.

Shanghai Film Bureau Deputy Director Cheng Zhigou told reporters that the emergence of commercial films is inevitable, but they indeed affect the improvement of China's film art level. We have the responsibility to cultivate a group of audiences with a relatively high appreciation level and improve the general public's artistic appreciation. If we continue to lower the audience's taste, art films will have no place to stand, and the consequences will be serious. The establishment of art cinemas will be recorded in the annals of film history.

The managers of the Ping'an and Shengli art cinemas expressed that they will strive to attract more audiences for high-quality films, regardless of box office revenue.

The first film to be screened at the art cinemas is "The Evening Bell." The Shanghai Film Bureau has prepared ten excellent films for successive screenings to create an impact.

It is understood that the art cinemas will also re-screen a batch of representative films from various periods. The arts community hopes that films such as "Wu Xun Transmits," "Regiment Commander," "Flute Across the Horizon," and "The Last Emperor" can be shown again to the audience, so that people can understand the historical development of Chinese cinema.

　　为艺术影片发展创造条件
    全国首家艺术影院在上海创办
    本报上海３月１２日电  记者章世鸿报道：文艺界强烈呼吁，鉴于商业化电影的泛滥，当前迫切需要为高层次的艺术影片的生存和发展创造条件。为此，上海两家艺术电影院即将开幕。全国九大城市也将近期内创建１１家艺术电影院。
    上海电影局副局长成志谷对记者说，商业化电影的出现是不可避免的，但它确实影响我国电影艺术水平的提高。我们有责任造就一批具有较高欣赏水平的观众，提高广大观众的艺术欣赏力。如果把观众的胃口越调越低，艺术影片没有立足之地，其后果将是严重的。艺术影院的建立将载入电影史册。
    平安、胜利两家艺术影院的经理表示：他们将为高层次的影片争取更多观众，不计较票房收入。
    艺术影院放映的第一部影片是《晚钟》，上海电影局已准备好十部优秀影片陆续放映，以造成声势。
    据悉，艺术影院还将复映一批各个时期有代表性的影片。文艺界希望《武训传》、《关连长》、《洞箫横吹》、《清宫秘史》等影片能再次同观众见面，以了解我国电影发展的历史进程。
