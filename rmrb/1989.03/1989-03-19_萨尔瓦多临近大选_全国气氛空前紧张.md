In the run-up to El Salvador's elections, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) has intensified its resistance activities and military operations, creating an atmosphere of unprecedented tension throughout the country.

The elections are scheduled for March 19th. To disrupt this election, a few days ago, the guerrilla forces called for a nationwide transportation strike starting from the early hours of the 16th, and gas stations to cease operations. Yesterday, El Salvador's land transportation was in a state of paralysis. The highways passing through Central America via El Salvador were cut off, public buses in the capital, San Salvador, stopped running, and only a few private cars and taxis were seen on the streets. The military dispatched military vehicles to transport people to work. In the past two days, the guerrillas also blew up 17 power transmission towers, causing 6 high-voltage power lines and 3 hydroelectric stations to stop supplying electricity. The government said that the country's power supply has been reduced by 50%. The guerrillas also placed a bomb near the presidential palace the day before yesterday. The guerrillas have warned that they will attack polling stations on election day and have urged people not to vote.

In January of this year, the guerrilla forces proposed a peace initiative, agreeing to participate in this year's elections, but demanded that the election date be postponed from March to September to allow for the organization of election campaigns. However, due to opposition from domestic far-right forces, especially the military, the authorities rejected the guerrillas' proposal and insisted on holding the elections as originally scheduled. As a result, the guerrillas' stance has hardened again, deciding to boycott the elections and stating that they will not accept the military's unilateral ceasefire proposal.

With domestic peace unachievable and the economy in chaos, President Duarte's health has deteriorated due to the spread of liver cancer, making it difficult for him to continue his duties. The ruling Christian Democratic Party's prestige is waning. Many people believe that the far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance may gain the upper hand in the elections. President Duarte recently told The New York Times that if the Nationalist Republican Alliance comes to power, it will exacerbate the civil war with the guerrillas, leading to a confrontation between the people and the government, and increasing support for the guerrilla side.

### 萨尔瓦多临近大选  全国气氛空前紧张

　　萨尔瓦多临近大选  全国气氛空前紧张
    本报加拉加斯３月１７日电  记者朱满庭报道：在萨尔瓦多大选前夕，游击队组织法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线加紧了抵制活动和军事行动，全国气氛空前紧张。
    大选预定在１９日举行。为了抵制这次大选，几天前，游击队方面号召全国运输业从１６日凌晨开始罢工，加油站停止营业。昨天萨尔瓦多的陆路交通已处瘫痪状态。中美洲通过萨尔瓦多的公路中断，首都圣萨尔瓦多公共汽车停驶，街上只有少量的私人汽车和出租汽车。军队只出动军车运送上班的人们。前两天，游击队还炸毁了１７座输电塔，６条高压线路和３个水电站停止供电。政府方面说，全国电力供应减少５０％。游击队前天还在总统府附近安放了炸弹。游击队已经警告说，大选那天要攻击投票站，要求人们不要去投票。
    今年１月，游击队方面提出一项和平倡议，同意参加今年的大选，但要求把大选日期从３月份推迟到９月份，以便进行竞选组织工作。但在国内极右势力，特别是军队方面的反对下，当局拒绝了游击队的主张，坚持大选按原定的日期举行。为此，游击队的立场也再次强硬起来，决定抵制大选，并表示不接受军方的单方面停火建议。
    国内和平无法实现，经济陷于混乱，杜阿尔特总统由于肝癌扩散，病情恶化，难以继续视事，执政的基督教民主党威信日减。不少人认为，极右翼的民族主义共和联盟可能在大选中占上风，杜阿尔特总统最近对《纽约时报》发表讲话说，民族主义共和联盟上台将会加剧同游击队的内战，这将导致人民与政府的对立，增加对游击队方面的支持。
