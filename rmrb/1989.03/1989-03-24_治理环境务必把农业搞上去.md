To address environmental issues, it is essential to prioritize agriculture. In the process of rectifying the economic environment and restoring economic order, ensuring a bumper harvest for the next two years and creating favorable conditions for the long-term development of agriculture is a crucial task.

Agriculture plays a highly sensitive role in China's national economy, as proven by years of practice. In recent years, China's national economy has encountered some instability, with imbalances within the industrial sector, between industries, and between departments. However, the overall imbalance is largely due to the lack of coordination between agriculture and industry, as well as other non-agricultural sectors. Addressing this structural imbalance is a key issue in rectifying the economic environment. Slowing down the overheated industrial growth and boosting agricultural development should be two complementary aspects of the rectification and adjustment efforts.

Food and clothing are the primary needs of people, and only with ample food and clothing can other endeavors flourish. The overheated industrial growth and the sluggish agricultural development have led to tensions in people's lives. In recent years, the stagnation of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil has quickly made our economic lives tight. Some cities have had to reintroduce rationing for major food items; in some places, it is difficult to purchase satisfactory agricultural products; and the price increases in agricultural products due to supply shortages have become a highly sensitive issue. This situation has a significant impact on people's lives and emotions. The stagnation of agriculture also imposes a significant constraint on other sectors. According to statistics, the output value of light industry using agricultural and sideline products accounts for about one-third of the total output value of light industry. In China's total export value of primary products, agricultural and sideline products account for about six to seven-tenths, and processed products also account for a considerable proportion. If agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and other related industries "catch a cold," many subsequent sectors will also be affected. More importantly, the shortage of agricultural products not only drives up the prices of processed goods made from agricultural products but also pushes up the prices of various other products. The rise in food prices directly increases the burden on enterprise employees and raises enterprise costs. Given that many enterprises currently find it difficult to absorb the price increases, it is inevitable that various products will compete to raise prices. It is certain that as long as the situation in agriculture does not improve and the effective supply of agricultural products does not increase, inflation cannot be curbed, and the task of rectifying the economic environment cannot be completed.

In the process of rectifying the economic environment, a crucial task is to adjust the relationship between industry and agriculture, to slow down the overly fast industrial growth, and to give due attention to the relatively sluggish agriculture. In the early 1980s, China's agriculture grew rapidly, which was a success of the household contract responsibility system in rural areas and a result of a significant adjustment in the relationship between agriculture and industry in the national economy. In recent years, agriculture has significantly weakened, agricultural investment has decreased, and agricultural engineering, agricultural-related industries, and other related work such as agricultural science and technology have been neglected to varying degrees. This has hindered the further development of agriculture to higher and deeper levels, making agricultural issues increasingly prominent in the face of the growing demand for the national economy and people's lives. This shows that the stagnation of agriculture is not due to any problems within agriculture itself, nor is it due to any deviations in rural reforms. It cannot be blamed on the "household contract responsibility system" after the "Great Leap Forward." Instead, it is the result of the development of contradictions between industry and agriculture, and between urban and rural areas in the new situation. Therefore, whether from the perspective of the overall rectification of the economic environment or from the development of the rural economy, it is necessary to further adjust the relationship between industry and agriculture and implement a policy of tilting towards agriculture.

Once agriculture improves, the effective supply of agricultural products will increase, and the development of various sectors will be much smoother. The various pressures in the current economic life will also gradually ease.

　　治理环境务必把农业搞上去
    本报评论员
    在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序中，把农业搞上去，首先求得今明两年农业丰收，继而为农业的长远发展创造良好的条件和打下坚实的基础，是摆在我们面前的一项关键性任务。
    农业在我国国民经济这个大的系统工程中处于十分敏感的地位，已被多年的实践所证明。近年来，我国国民经济中出现了一些不稳定的因素，这当中有工业内部产业与产业、部门与部门、行业与行业之间的不平衡问题。但从总体上看，跟农业与工业以及其他非农产业发展不协调关系甚大。解决这个大的结构性失调，无疑是治理经济环境突出的一个大问题。把过热的工业速度降下来，把农业的温度升一升，应当是治理整顿工作并行不悖的两个方面。
    吃饭穿衣是人的第一需要，丰衣足食才会有各项事业的繁荣。工业过热，农业偏冷带来的问题，首先是人民生活的紧张。这几年，农业主要是粮、棉、油等大宗农产品的徘徊，很快就使我们的经济生活变得紧巴起来。一些城市主要副食品不得不重新采取凭票供应的办法；一些地方难以买到满意的农产品；由于供应不足引起的市场农产品价格上涨，成为一个十分敏感的问题。这种状况对于人民生活和人们的情绪影响很大。农业上不动，对其他部门也形成很大制约。据统计，以农副产品为原料的轻工业产值约占轻工业总产值的１／３，我国出口的初级产品总额中，农副产品约占六七成，制成品也占相当比例。农业、林业、畜牧业等产业打个“喷嚏”，其后的许多部门都得“感冒”。更为重要的是，农产品供应不足，不仅推动着以农产品为原料的加工品的涨价，也在推动着其他各类产品价格的上升。食品价格上涨，直接加大了企业职工的负担，加大了企业成本，在相当多企业目前还难以消化涨价因素的情况下，势必要推动各类产品竞相涨价。可以肯定，只要农业的状况不改变，农产品的有效供给不增加，通货膨胀就不可能得到抑止，治理经济环境的任务也就不可能完成。
    在治理经济环境中把农业搞上去，当前重要的一项任务是调整工业和农业的关系，把过高的工业速度降下来，使偏冷的农业得到应有的重视。８０年代初期，我国农业增长较快，是农村实行联产承包责任制这一大的改革取得的成功，也是在国民经济中对工农业关系实行大调整带来的结果。近年来，农业明显削弱，农业投入减少，农业工程、农用工业以及和农业有关的其他诸如农业科技等工作受到了不同程度的忽视，因而妨碍了农业向更高更深层次发展，使得农业问题在国民经济和人民生活需求一个劲儿增长的形势面前愈益突出出来。这说明，农业徘徊，主要并不是农业自身出了什么问题，不是农村改革出现了什么偏差，不能归罪于“大包干”后一家一户的经营，而是工农矛盾、城乡矛盾在新形势下有所发展的结果。因此，无论从治理经济环境大局出发，还是从农村经济发展来看，都要进一步调整工农关系，实行农业倾斜政策。
    农业上去了，农产品的有效供给增加了，各行各业的发展就会顺利得多，目前经济生活中的种种压力也就会逐步减轻。
