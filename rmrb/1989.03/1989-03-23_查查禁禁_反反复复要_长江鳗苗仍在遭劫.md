The illegal fishing of eel fry in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River has surged again after a brief decline following the seizure of thousands of boats. Since March 14, the government of Nantong City, Jiangsu Province, has taken emergency action to investigate and punish lawbreakers.

Among the more than a thousand people caught, very few are fishermen. Most are ship owners and farmers. Among them, more than 30% are from Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shandong provinces. Some local officials are also involved in these illegal activities.

Due to outdated inspection methods and some law enforcement officers being bribed, the inspection and prohibition work is even more difficult. Jiangsu has over 1,000 kilometers of coastline along the Yangtze River and the sea, but it has fewer than 30 fishery administration boats. In the face of lawbreakers using modern tools like walkie-talkies, the inspection force seems insufficient.

Relevant officials from Jiangsu Province and the Ministry of Agriculture pointed out: The urgent task is to quickly lower the current purchase price of eel fry and to solve the problem of insufficient inspection and prohibition forces as soon as possible.

### 查查禁禁　反反复复要  长江鳗苗仍在遭劫

　　查查禁禁　反反复复           
    长江鳗苗仍在遭劫
    长江中下游滥捕鳗鱼苗的势头，在数千条船被查处后曾一度减弱，近日又重新抬头。自３月１４日以来，江苏省南通市政府又一次紧急行动，查获并惩处不法分子。
    从被查处的上千名违法人员看，渔民比例很少，大多数是运输船主及农民。其中，浙江、安徽、山东等省的船民占３０％以上。一些基层干部也混杂其间，大搞非法活动。
    由于查处手段落后，加上少数执法人员财迷心窍，甘作内应，查禁工作难度更大。江苏沿江沿海岸线１０００多公里，渔政船艇却不足３０条。在不法分子普遍使用对讲机等现代工具的情况下，查处工作力量显得单薄。
    江苏省和农业部有关负责人指出：当务之急是把现行的鳗苗收购价迅速降下来，同时尽快解决查禁力量不足的问题。
