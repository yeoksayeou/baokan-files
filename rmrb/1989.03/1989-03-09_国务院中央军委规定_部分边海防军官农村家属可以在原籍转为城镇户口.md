Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 8th.

The State Council and Central Military Commission recently stipulated that some rural family members of officers in the People's Liberation Army's border and coastal defense units can change their household registration to urban in their hometowns.

The notice issued by the State Council and Central Military Commission for forwarding the report from the Ministry of Public Security and the General Political Department, among other departments, states that the People's Liberation Army units stationed in border, island, desert, and remote areas bear the arduous tasks of building and defending the border and coastal defenses. Due to the constraints of the stationing conditions, some family members of officers who meet the conditions for relocation cannot accompany their spouses, causing many difficulties for the officers and their families. For these units, allowing the family members of officers who meet the conditions for relocation but reside in rural areas to change their household registration to urban in their hometowns and arrange appropriate jobs is conducive to stabilizing the officers' thoughts and building the border defense forces.

The notice requires all regions, departments, and units to, from the perspective of consolidating the border and coastal defenses and national security, actively implement the household registration change for officers' family members residing in rural areas, handle urban resident grain and oil supply procedures, arrange jobs, and enroll children in schools.

　　国务院中央军委规定
    部分边海防军官农村家属可以在原籍转为城镇户口
    据新华社北京３月８日电  国务院、中央军委新近规定，人民解放军边海防等部队部分农村户口军官家属可在原籍转为城镇户口。
    国务院、中央军委为批转公安部、总政治部等部门的报告发出的通知指出，人民解放军驻边防、海岛、沙漠和边远地区的部队，担负着建设和保卫边防、海防的艰巨任务，由于受驻地条件的限制，部分符合随军条件的军官家属不能随军，给军官及其家属的生活带来了许多困难。对这些部队中符合随军条件而家居农村不能随军的军官家属，允许其在原籍转为城镇户口并安排适当工作，有利于军官思想的稳定和边疆部队的建设。
    通知要求各地区、各部门、各单位要从巩固边防、海防和国家安全的大局出发，对家居农村的军官家属的转户，办理城镇居民粮、油供应手续，安排工作和子女入学等，积极落实。
