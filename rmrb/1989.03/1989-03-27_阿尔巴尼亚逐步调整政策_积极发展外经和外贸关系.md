In recent years, as Albania has gradually adjusted its foreign policy, it has significantly increased its economic and trade exchanges with the outside world, playing an important role in promoting national economic construction.

Since the emergence of a positive trend of understanding and cooperation in the Balkans, Albania has attached greater importance to developing stable economic relations with countries in the region and beyond, and its economic and trade exchanges have become increasingly frequent. In addition to continuing traditional trade, Albania last year also conducted border trade with neighboring countries such as Yugoslavia, Greece, and Italy. While continuing to trade with Eastern European countries, a notable new feature in Albania's foreign relations over the past one or two years has been the rapid development of economic and trade relations with Western developed countries. Last year, Albania signed its first government-to-government economic and trade agreement with Japan. Albania's trade volume with Austria last year increased by nearly 60% compared to the previous year, reaching 330 million Austrian schillings. To ensure the steady development of trade and the expansion of economic cooperation, the two countries signed their first annual trade agreement this year. Albania's economic relations with West Germany have developed rapidly since the establishment of diplomatic ties in October 1987. The bilateral trade volume last year exceeded 100 million marks. Albania now considers West Germany as one of its most important economic and trade partners.

Starting last year, Albania also established government-level economic, industrial, and technological cooperation committees with countries such as West Germany, Austria, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, and France. These committees serve as coordinating bodies to promote various forms of bilateral economic cooperation. Currently, a number of projects and equipment imported from abroad are under construction or installation.

Albania's trade with China has also seen some recovery and development in recent years. The annual trade volume between the two countries is now maintained at over $40 million.

To adapt to the new situation in foreign economic and trade development, Albania has begun to move away from its previous rigid and outdated trade practices, adopting internationally accepted flexible trade and payment methods such as compensation trade, processing with supplied materials, leasing, and deferred payments. This provides new possibilities for further expanding foreign economic and trade activities.

　　阿尔巴尼亚逐步调整政策        
    积极发展外经和外贸关系
    新华社地拉那３月２５日电  近年来，随着对外政策的逐步调整，阿尔巴尼亚大大增加了与外界的经贸往来，对国家经济建设起了重要的推动作用。
    自从巴尔干地区出现谅解与合作的积极进程以来，阿尔巴尼亚更加重视与该地区及其他国家发展稳定的经济关系，与它们的经贸往来日趋频繁。除继续进行传统的贸易外，阿尔巴尼亚去年又与邻国南斯拉夫、希腊和意大利开展边境贸易；在继续与东欧国家进行贸易的同时，与西方发达国家迅速发展经贸关系是近一两年来阿对外关系中一个引人注目的新特点。去年，阿首次同日本签订了政府间经贸协议。阿与奥地利的贸易额去年比前年增加近６０％，达到３．３亿奥地利先令。为保证稳步发展贸易，扩大经济合作，阿奥两国今年又签订了第一个年度换货议定书。阿与联邦德国的经济关系自１９８７年１０月建交以来发展迅速。双边贸易额去年已超过１亿马克。阿已把联邦德国视为最重要的经贸伙伴。
    阿从去年起还同联邦德国、奥地利、希腊、土耳其、保加利亚、法国等国家成立了政府间经济、工业与技术合作混合委员会，作为协调和促进双边多种形式经济合作的机构。目前，一批从国外引进的项目和设备正在建设或安装中。
    阿与中国的贸易近年来也有所恢复和发展。目前两国年度贸易额保持在４０００多万美元。
    为了适应对外经贸发展的新形势，阿开始注意摆脱以往陈旧僵化的贸易方式，试行了诸如补偿贸易、来料加工、租赁、延期付款等国际上通行的灵活贸易和支付方式，为进一步扩大对外经贸提供了新的可能。
