The 4th Company of the Dashaoshan Hero Regiment of the Guangzhou Military Region, known for their strict adherence to discipline and the nickname "not even a single hair harmed," has maintained and carried forward the fine tradition of the people's army loving the people for 40 years since they performed guard duties in Beijing in 1949. Look, on March 4th, during a training march, this company had gone a whole day and night without drinking water, but no one touched a single stalk of sugarcane that was within reach.

    甘蔗田里
    1949年在北京担任警卫任务期间以严守群众纪律饮誉军内外，有“秋毫无犯连”之称的广州军区塔山英雄团四连，40年如一日，保持和发扬人民军队爱人民的优良传统。你瞧，3月4日，这个连在拉练中，已一天一夜没喝上水了，但谁也没有动一根顺手可得的甘蔗。
