Today morning, at the Jingxi Hotel where Tianjin's representatives to the Seventh National People's Congress are staying, a reporter asked the representatives from Tianjin: Why did the 1988 survey of 1,000 households in Tianjin show that 84.9% of the people understand the prices of subsidiary foodstuffs and are satisfied with the supply of subsidiary foodstuffs?

Zhang Huaguo, Director of the Tianjin Municipal Economic Commission and a delegate to the National People's Congress, said that the municipal government has invested a lot of effort in building vegetable and subsidiary foodstuff bases, laying a material foundation for stabilizing prices. For example, this year the municipal government decided to increase the per capita commercial vegetable field from 4.8 mu to 5.3 mu.

The people of Tianjin, who live by the Bohai Sea, love to eat fish and shrimp. However, four years ago, there was no fish or shrimp to eat. Mayor Li Ruihuan called out in 1985, "Struggle for three years, and eating fish will not be difficult." He encouraged suburban farmers to take advantage of their proximity to the sea and the abundance of ponds to vigorously develop marine and freshwater aquaculture. By 1988, the city's aquaculture area had doubled compared to 1984, and the aquatic product output reached 87,000 tons.

Nian Jinglin, Vice Chairman of the Trade Union of the Zhongyuan Company of the Tianjin Municipal First Commercial Bureau and a delegate to the National People's Congress, said: "Open the newspapers of Tianjin, listen to the radio of Tianjin, and there are always news about price inspections." This national first-class labor model, who is still working at the counter today, has a deep understanding of the relationship between strengthening price supervision, strictly enforcing price discipline, and the price situation in Tianjin.

Today, Tianjin not only has more than 300 professional price inspection personnel who take it as their duty to stop price hikes, but also more than 5,000 volunteer price inspectors have emerged from the masses. In 1988, the city handled more than 10,000 cases of price-related violations, with a total economic penalty of more than 17 million yuan.

Zhu Zhaofang, a senior engineer at the Tianjin Municipal Urban Construction Survey and Design Institute and a delegate to the National People's Congress, said that in the past two years, Tianjin's prices have been relatively low and stable among large and medium-sized cities in the country. The broad masses of Party members and League members taking the initiative to share the country's worries is an important reason. Why did the panic buying in the summer and autumn of 1988 only last a week in Tianjin? From my unit, it is because the Party organization spoke in time, and Party members and League members took the lead in guarding their posts and not joining the panic buying.

　　天津代表畅谈物价较稳原因：
    建好菜园鱼池　强化市场监督
    本报北京３月１８日讯  记者鹿舫报道：今天上午，在天津市出席全国人大七届二次会议代表下榻的京西宾馆，记者问来自天津的人大代表：为什么天津１９８８年千户居民问卷调查，８４．９％的群众对副食品价格表示理解，对副食品供应表示满意？
    全国人大代表、天津市经委主任张华国说，市政府花大力气建设蔬菜、副食品基地，为稳定物价奠定了物质基础。譬如，今年市政府决定商品菜田由人均４．８厘增加到５．３厘。
    渤海之滨的天津人爱吃鱼虾，而４年前就是没鱼虾吃。市长李瑞环１９８５年带头喊出“奋战３年、吃鱼不难”。他鼓励郊县农民利用靠海边、坑塘多的优势，大力发展海水和淡水养殖。到１９８８年，全市水产养殖面积比１９８４年增加了一倍，水产品产量达８．７万吨。
    全国人大代表、天津市一商局中原公司工会副主席年景林说：“翻开天津的报纸，听天津的广播，老有物价检查的新闻。”这位至今仍在站柜台的全国特等劳模，对强化物价监督、严肃物价纪律与天津物价形势间的关系，感触良多。
    今天，天津不仅有３００多名专业物价检查人员以制止乱涨价为己任，而且从群众中涌现出５０００余名义务物价检查员。１９８８年，全市共处理有关物价的违纪案件１万多起，经济制裁总金额达１７００多万元。
    全国人大代表、天津市政工程勘测设计院高级工程师朱兆芳说，近两年天津的物价在全国大中城市中是较低较稳的一个，广大党团员主动为国分忧是重要原因。１９８８年夏秋之交的抢购风，为什么天津只刮了一个星期？从我所在单位看，是由于党组织及时发话，党团员带头坚守工作岗位而不去抢购。
