Political disagreements do not affect citizenship rights
    Poland restores citizenship of government officials from World War II

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, March 19 (Reporter Dong Fusheng) The Polish government today announced the restoration of Polish citizenship for five leaders of the Polish bourgeois government and military during World War II.

    This is a decision made by the Polish Council of Ministers on March 15. This is the second major rehabilitation decision announced by Polish authorities in recent days. On March 14, the Polish Supreme Prosecutor's Office announced the rehabilitation of former Deputy Commander of the National Army, General O.E. Firdof.

    Today, those whose citizenship was restored by the Polish government include: Stanislaw Mikolajczyk, who served as the Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile in London during World War II, and later returned to the country to serve as the Deputy Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of National Unity of Poland and the Chairman of the Polish Peasant Party. In 1947, he fled abroad and subsequently had his Polish citizenship revoked; General Wladyslaw Anders, who was one of the main military leaders of the Polish government-in-exile, had his Polish citizenship revoked by the Provisional Government of National Unity of Poland in September 1946. Additionally, there are three activists from right-wing parties who had their Polish citizenship revoked in 1949.

    The Polish Council of Ministers emphasized today, when announcing the restoration of citizenship for the aforementioned five individuals, that 40 years ago, the Polish government revoked their citizenship due to "sharp political disagreements," and that political disagreements should not result in their expulsion from the "citizen family," especially those with patriotic merits who should not be expelled.

　　政治分歧不影响公民权        
    波恢复二战期间政府人士国籍
    新华社华沙３月１９日电  （记者董福生）波兰政府今天宣布为第二次世界大战期间波兰资产阶级政府和军队的５名领导人恢复波兰国籍。
    这是波兰部长会议３月１５日作出的决定。这是近几天来波兰当局宣布的第二起重大平反决定，３月１４日波兰最高检察院曾宣布为原国家军副司令员奥·埃·菲尔多夫少将平反昭雪。
    今天，被波兰政府宣布恢复国籍的有：斯坦尼斯瓦夫·米科瓦伊奇科，第二次世界大战期间他担任在伦敦的波兰流亡政府的总理，战后回国任波兰民族团结临时政府副总理、波兰农民党主席。１９４７年他逃亡国外，随后被取消波兰国籍；瓦迪斯瓦夫·安德尔斯将军，他是波兰流亡政府的主要军事将领之一，１９４６年９月被波兰民族团结临时政府宣布取消波兰国籍。此外，还有１９４９年被取消波兰国籍的３名当时的右翼党派的活动家。
    波兰部长会议今天在宣布为上述５人恢复国籍时强调，４０年前波兰政府是因为“尖锐的政治分歧”取消他们国籍的，而政治分歧是不应该把他们开除“公民大家庭”的，尤其是那些“有着爱国功绩的人”更不应被开除。
