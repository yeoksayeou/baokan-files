The Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China recently issued an order to commend units that participated in the earthquake relief efforts in the Lancang and Gengma regions of Yunnan Province.

The order, signed by Military Commission Chairman Deng Xiaoping, states that on November 6, 1988, the Lancang and Gengma regions of Yunnan Province experienced consecutive earthquakes measuring 7.6 and 7.2 on the Richter scale. The Chengdu Military Region and Air Force units promptly executed the directives of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, dispatching large numbers of troops, vehicles, aircraft, and nearly ten thousand militia members to participate in the rescue and relief efforts. They fought tirelessly for over 30 days, making significant contributions to the success of the earthquake relief operations. They earned the high praise of the Party and the government and the respect and love of the local ethnic minority populations.

To honor the advanced units that emerged during the earthquake relief efforts, the Central Military Commission decided:

To award the "Model Medical Team for Earthquake Relief" honorific title to the medical team from the 62nd Hospital of the People's Liberation Army;
To confer a second-class collective merit citation on a certain anti-aircraft artillery brigade.

The order calls on all military personnel to learn from their selfless dedication, unyielding spirit, and commitment to serving the people; to learn from their fearlessness in the face of danger, heroic tenacity, and unyielding advance; to learn from their strict adherence to orders, integrity, and high sense of organizational discipline; to learn from their consideration for the overall situation, close coordination, and united struggle. They are to take these units as examples, thoroughly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee and the expanded meeting of the Military Commission, and solidly strengthen the comprehensive construction of the grassroots level. They are to continuously improve the combat effectiveness of the troops and make greater contributions to the defense and construction of the motherland!
