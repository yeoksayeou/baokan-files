Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 4th.

Taipei: The Taiwan "High Court" yesterday overturned a previous verdict, acquitting two Taiwanese businessmen who were previously sentenced to prison for conducting direct trade with the mainland. The court allowed the two businessmen to be released on bail using their household registration as collateral.

Taiwanese businessmen Lin Guanmin and Guo Shuhai were sentenced to five years in prison each by the Taiwan "High Court" in May last year for selling eel fry to the mainland. This ruling sparked widespread outrage in Taiwan. Public opinion held that as cross-strait exchanges continued to expand, it was unreasonable and unjust to charge businessmen with "aiding the enemy" under the so-called "Sedition Act" for conducting trade with the mainland. Guo and Lin appealed to the Taiwan "Supreme Court," which subsequently remanded the case back to the "High Court" for a retrial.

　　与大陆直接贸易无罪
    被判“资匪罪”的两台商获释
    新华社香港３月４日电  台北消息：台湾“高等法院”昨天更改一项判决，对去年被判处有期徒刑的两名与大陆直接贸易的台湾商人改判无罪，当庭允许两名商人以户口作保释放。
    台湾商人林关民、郭树槐，于１９８７年间因贩卖鳗鱼苗到大陆，被台湾“高等法院”于去年５月以“资匪罪”各判徒刑５年。这在台湾各界引起极大的不平。舆论认为，随着海峡两岸交流日渐扩大，商人到大陆贸易却被引用所谓的“惩治叛乱条例”来加罪，实在是于理于情不容。郭、林二人不服判决，上诉至台湾“最高法院”，而后此案被驳回“高等法院”更审。
