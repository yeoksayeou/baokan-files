Theft of railway transported goods is becoming increasingly severe. In recent years, the theft along railway lines has been worsening. Just in my company's business department, there were over 2,000 cases of cargo theft insurance claims last year, with compensation amounting to over 2 million yuan. According to incomplete statistics from the Shanghai Commercial Storage and Transportation Joint Venture Company, from January to November last year, this company shipped goods including color televisions, VCRs, tape recorders, clothing, blankets, high-end leather shoes, electronic keyboards, cameras, and bicycles, totaling nearly 3 million yuan in scarce and valuable items and resources, with 5,996 cargo cars stolen. Compared to 1982, the value of stolen goods has increased nearly tenfold, and the number of stolen cargo cars has doubled.

Currently, a notable feature of the theft of railway transported goods is the shift from individual items to whole items, from low-end to high-end goods, from petty theft to organized gang theft, and from the north to the south. On November 1, 1988, six cargo cars sent by the Shanghai Storage Company to Yunnan were stopped at Xichang South Station in Sichuan. Eight or nine people forcibly climbed onto the cars and looted the goods. When four escorts tried to stop them, the thieves used stones to violently attack the escorts, displaying extreme arrogance.

Another feature of railway theft is the involvement of railway employees in stealing railway transported goods. On October 28, 1988, a train from Shanghai to Mianyang, Sichuan, stopped at a station en route. Around 3 AM, an escort saw a train maintenance worker jump onto the cargo car and use a knife to cut open the covering to steal goods. When the escort chased after him, he intercepted one of the thief's signal lamps. When the train reached the next station, two people claiming to be station directors stopped the escort and snatched the signal lamp.

The rampant theft of railway transported goods not only causes losses to the state's resources and affects market supply but also corrupts social morals and creates a negative impact. It is urged that the railway public security departments and local governments along the railway lines strictly fulfill their duties and severely crack down on theft crimes.

### 偷盗铁路运输货物现象日趋严重

　　偷盗铁路运输货物现象日趋严重
    近年来，铁路沿线的偷盗风越刮越盛。仅我公司营业部去年受理的货物被盗保险就有２０００多起，赔款金额达２００多万元。据上海商业储运联营公司的不完全统计，去年１至１１月，这家公司发出的货物中就有彩色电视机、录相机、收录机、服装、毛毯、高档皮鞋、电子琴、照相机、自行车等价值近３００万元的紧俏商品和贵重物资被盗，被盗车皮数达５９９６车。与１９８２年相比，被盗金额增加近１０倍，被盗车皮数翻了两番。
    当前，盗窃铁路运输货物的一个显著特点是：从零星转向整件，从低档商品转向高档商品，从小偷小摸、单干转向公开、团伙盗窃，从北方蔓延到南方。１９８８年１１月１日，上海商储公司发往云南的６车皮货到四川西昌南站时，有八九个人强行爬上车抢劫货物。４名押运人员阻拦时，盗窃者竟用石块猛砸押运员，气焰甚为嚣张。
    铁路职工盗窃铁路运输物资，是铁路盗窃的另一个特点。１９８８年１０月２８日，上海发往四川绵阳的列车停靠在中途某站，凌晨３点左右，押运员见一名列车检修员跳上货车，用刀划破苫布行窃。押运员追赶时，截下行窃者的一只号志灯。车到下一站时，有两个自称是站内主任的人拦下押运员，抢走号志灯。
    偷盗铁路运输物资风盛行，不仅使国家的物资蒙受损失，影响市场供应，而且败坏社会风气，造成恶劣影响。呼吁铁道公安部门和铁路沿线各级地方政府严格履行职责，严厉打击盗窃犯罪分子。
