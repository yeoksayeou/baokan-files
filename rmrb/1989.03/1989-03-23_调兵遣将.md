Interviewing “Two Sessions,” Hong Kong and Macau journalists were particularly active, but unfortunately, they were “outnumbered and outmatched,” often having to choose between different tasks. This is what happened: Hong Kong TVB’s Chen Huier complained to the reporter: “Yesterday, I covered the morning session at the Great Hall of the People and attended a press conference in the afternoon, sending out two reports, but I missed Yan Mingfu’s speech at the Hong Kong and Macau delegation.” “Fortunately,” she pointed to the nearby Miss Xie Caiyun: “She came last night, and now I feel much more at ease.”

From her name card, the elegant and refined Miss Xie is a senior reporter. Although her title is high, she is only in her early twenties. She interrupted her overseas coverage and flew directly to Beijing to assist Chen Huier.

　　调兵遣将
    采访“两会”，港澳记者异常活跃，但无奈“势孤力单”，常常顾此失彼。这不，香港无线电台的陈慧儿向记者“诉苦”：“昨天，上午大会堂采访，下午参加新闻发布会，发了两个稿儿，阎明复在港澳组的发言却没听上。”“幸好”，她手指身边的谢彩云小姐：“她昨晚赶来了，我就踏实多了。”
    从名片看，秀丽端庄的谢小姐是高级记者，职务虽高，年龄不过二十出头。她是中断了在国外的采访，直飞北京的，以助陈慧儿一臂之力。
