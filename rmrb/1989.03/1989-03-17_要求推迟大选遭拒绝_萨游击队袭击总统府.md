Request to Postpone Elections Rejected; Salvadoran Guerrillas Attack Presidential Palace

San Salvador, March 16th - Salvadoran guerrillas attacked the presidential palace in the southern district of the capital, San Salvador, on the evening of the 15th using bombs.

A colonel from the presidential palace's security forces told the media that at 6:35 PM on the 15th, the guerrillas fired several bombs using a grenade launcher at the security forces' outpost. Several bombs fell inside the presidential palace, injuring one security personnel. There was no significant material damage inside the presidential palace. President Duarte was not in the presidential palace when the guerrillas launched the attack. Nearby residential buildings were also hit by guerrilla gunfire, injuring six people.

The recent military offensives launched by the guerrillas aim to disrupt the national elections scheduled for March 19th.
