Open and Honest Discussion – A Record of a Talk by Newly Added National CPPCC Members

By Zhang Heping and Xiaodu

Yesterday afternoon, more than 20 newly added members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) were invited to the "Home of Non-Communist Parties and Personages Without Party Affiliation," the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China.

Among them were prominent figures from democratic parties, religious circles, cultural circles, economic circles, and experts, scholars, as well as leaders from the Party, government, and military. Notable figures included Liang Congjie, grandson of Liang Qichao; Feng Lida, daughter of General Feng Yuxiang; Lin Li, daughter of Lin Boqu; and He Luli, daughter of former Mayor of Beiping, He Shiyuan.

As the host, Vice Minister of the United Front Work Department, Wu Lianyuan, gave an opening speech and then pointed to a "female general": "Comrade Feng Lida, please speak first, but today we won't discuss qigong." The remark was warm and humorous, eliciting a round of hearty laughter.

Vice President of the Naval General Hospital and Vice Chairman of the National Qigong Research Association, Feng Lida, with her short hair neatly combed, spoke eloquently: "As a new member, I am both unfamiliar and familiar with the CPPCC." She fondly recalled her years following her father, Feng Yuxiang, and her mother, Li Dequan, in Chongqing during their work with the old CPPCC. "Unfortunately, the cooperation failed, and the civil war began." Reflecting on history, Feng Lida had deep feelings: "I realize that when the country can achieve multi-party cooperation and political consultation for common goals and democracy, the country will prosper and flourish."

As soon as she finished speaking, Yu Xizhong, a standing committee member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, took the microphone: "Reform and rectification are indeed the responsibility of the Communist Party and the government, but they also need the joint efforts of people from all walks of life. Complaining is useless, and just raising problems is not enough; we must also come up with good solutions." He expressed his willingness, as an old member of the industrial and commercial circles, to contribute ideas and strategies for reform and rectification.

Ding Guangxun, President of the China Christian Council, told everyone that recently, a book titled "Seek Common Ground While Reserving Differences" was published in the United States. The author, a scholar studying Chinese issues, believes that the theory and practice of the united front are a great creation and development of the Communist Party of China in politics. "He highly appreciates our political consultation system, and I also highly appreciate it." Ding Guangxun added: "I think where there is great power, there needs to be supervision. Our country is a large country and a large party, holding great power, making it easy to have corruption, and especially needing supervision."

Shen Jiyuan, who once served as a secretary to Sun Yueshi in the Resources Commission of the former National Government, expressed his feelings: "Scholars serve those who recognize their talents." He hoped that the Communist Party would do more to leverage the role of intellectuals.

Hong Kong and Macau delegates Lu Dazhuan and Lu Guangsheng also shared their thoughts. "With over a billion people in the country, 2,000 CPPCC members are less than two per million." These figures made Lu Dazhuan deeply aware of the heavy responsibility on his shoulders. He expressed that as a CPPCC member, he would participate in politics and policy-making well; as a Hong Kong entrepreneur, he would contribute to the stability and economic prosperity of Hong Kong.

Liang Congjie, son of the late famous architect Liang Sicheng, currently the director of the Chinese Culture Academy Publishing House and the editor of the "Intellectuals" series, said: "I have many friends in the cultural circle, including some 'sensitive individuals.' Although I do not agree with all their views and actions, as a CPPCC member and a representative of public opinion, I have the responsibility to open channels so that their opinions can be reflected."

Recently appointed Vice Minister of the United Front Work Department, Wan Shaofen, gave the closing speech, saying: "Those present are both new members and old friends. I hope everyone will make greater contributions to the revitalization of the nation, economic prosperity, and the prosperity of the country!"

The article then ends.

　　坦诚相见　畅所欲言
    ——全国新增政协委员座谈侧记
    本报记者  张何平  晓渡
    昨天下午，２０多位新增补的全国政协委员应邀来到有“党外人士之家”之称的中共中央统战部。
    他们中，有民主党派和宗教界、文化界、经济界等著名人士、专家学者及党政军领导人。其中不乏“名门之后”——梁启超先生的孙子梁从诫、冯玉祥将军的女儿冯理达、林伯渠同志的女儿林莉、原北平市长何思源先生的女儿何鲁丽等。
    作为“东道主”，统战部副部长武连元作“开场白”后，手指一员“女将”：“冯理达同志，请你先谈谈，但今天不谈气功。”亲切、诙谐，惹得一阵爽朗笑声。
    海军总医院副院长、全国医学气功研究会副理事长冯理达一抹短发，侃侃而谈：“作为新委员，我对政协既生疏，又熟悉。”她深情地回忆当年跟随致力旧政协工作的父亲冯玉祥、母亲李德全在重庆的那段生涯。“可惜，后来协商失败，内战开始。”回顾历史，冯理达深有感触：“我体会，当国家能够做到多党合作，政治协商，为共同目标讲民主时，国家就能兴旺发达。”
    话音刚落，全国工商联常委于熙钟要过话筒：“治理、整顿，固然是共产党和政府的事情，但也需要各界有识之士鼎力相助。发牢骚没有用，光提出问题也不够，还得提出好办法。”他表示，作为老工商界人士要为治理、整顿献计献策。
    中国基督教协会会长丁光训告诉大家，最近美国出了一本书，书名叫《求同存异》。写书人是研究中国问题的学者，他认为统一战线的理论和实践是中国共产党在政治上的一大创造和发展。“他很欣赏我们的政治协商制度，我自己也很欣赏。”丁老又说：“我觉得凡权力大的地方，就需要监督。我国是大国、大党，掌握大的权力，容易发生腐败现象，尤其需要监督。”
    曾经在原国民政府资源委员会为孙越崎老先生任秘书的沈嘉元抒发感慨：“士为知己者用”。他希望共产党在发挥知识分子作用方面做更多的工作。
    港澳委员陆达权和卢广声也谈了心里话。“全国有十亿多人，政协委员２０００挂零，１００万人还不到两个。”这几个数字，使陆达权委员深深意识到肩上的重任。他表示，作为政协委员，要很好地参政议政；作为香港的企业家，要为香港的稳定和经济繁荣作出贡献。
    已故著名建筑学家梁思成先生的儿子，现任中国文化书院编译馆馆长、《知识分子》文丛主编的梁从诫教授说：“我在文化界有很多朋友，包括一些‘敏感人物’。虽然我对他们的观点、做法不都赞成，但作为政协委员，民意代表，有责任疏通渠道，使他们的意见能够反映上来。”
    不久前调任统战部副部长的万绍芬作了“压轴”发言，她说：“在座的既是新委员，又是老朋友。希望大家为民族振兴、经济繁荣和国家昌盛，做出更大的贡献！”
