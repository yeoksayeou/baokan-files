	“Spirit” in different contexts has different meanings. Sometimes it refers to the essence of content, and sometimes it refers to a person's disposition. The former includes things like the spirit of superior instructions, the spirit of leadership speeches, the spirit of conference documents, and so on.

	However, these two different concepts of spirit are not entirely unrelated. For instance, in life, there are people who are particularly good at listening to the spirit from above. When there is a spirit from above, their spirit also comes. If there is a period when there is no spirit from above, they become listless, even to the point of being hospitalized or going to a sanatorium. But once they hear that there is a new spirit from above, it's as if they've been injected with a stimulant, and they will jump out of bed, becoming spirited again. This is a type of person who, under long-term "only above" influence, almost lacks independent thinking ability.

	Of course, firmly implementing the spirit from above is not entirely a bad thing. However, “above” is not just one entity; everyone wants to have their own spirit, and that's where the trouble starts.

	You have a spirit, I have a spirit, everyone has a spirit; you have one spirit, I have one spirit, a new spirit every day—what do we do? In reality, whether it's economic construction, democratic political construction, legal construction, Party construction, or spiritual civilization construction, there are overall guidelines and inherent laws that cannot be changed every day. If everywhere there is a new spirit, it means that everywhere there is no spirit. Once the spirit is scattered, it loses its effectiveness, and the spirit will be wasted.

	Rather than having one spirit per person, one spirit per day, causing confusion and lack of direction below, losing independent thinking and initiative, it would be better to have fewer spirits so that everyone can concentrate their spirits.

	When the spirit from above is reduced, and following a general spirit and objective laws as the spirit becomes more prevalent, our work will probably be easier, and everyone will truly be spirited.

### “精神”二重唱

　　“精神”二重唱
    “精神”在不同地方，含义也不同，有时指内容实质，有时又指人的气质。前者如上级指示精神、领导讲话精神、会议文件精神等等。
    但是，精神的这两个不同概念之间也不是绝对不搭界。比如说，生活中有一些人，专好探听上头精神。上头有了精神，他的精神也就来了。若是上面有一段时间没有精神，他也无精打彩起来，甚至住进医院、疗养所。而一旦闻说上头又有了新精神之后，就好像注进了兴奋剂，会一跃从病床上跳将下来，重新精神抖擞起来。这是在长期“唯上”的薰陶下几乎没有独立思考能力的一种人。
    当然，坚决贯彻上头精神的精神不全是坏事。然而，“上头”不只一个，谁都想有自己的精神，事情就麻烦。
    你也有精神，我也有精神，大家都有精神；你一个精神，我一个精神，一天一个精神，怎么办呢？其实，经济建设也好，民主政治建设也好，法制建设也好，党的建设也好，精神文明建设也好，都有总的遵循，都有它自身的固有规律，不可能天天都有新精神。如果到处都是新精神，等于到处都没有精神。精神一分散，也就没有多大作用了，精神怕就要白费的。
    与其一人一个精神、一天一个精神，弄得下面手忙脚乱，无所适从，失去了独立思维和自主精神，还不如少点精神，大家也好精神集中。
    什么时候上头精神少了，按一种总精神和以客观规律为精神多了，我们的事情大概就好办了，大家也就能真正精神百倍了。
