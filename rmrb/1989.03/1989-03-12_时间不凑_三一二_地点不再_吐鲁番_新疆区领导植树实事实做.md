The chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Tiemuerdawaimaiti, recently stated that starting this year, during the annual Arbor Day, the regional party, government, and military leaders will no longer, as in previous years, specially travel to the early-spring region of Turpan for tree planting. Instead, they will plant trees according to the local climate and season.

Every year on Arbor Day, most of Xinjiang is still cold and frozen. Therefore, the regional leaders and heads of departments and bureaus would drive nearly 400 kilometers to Turpan to participate in tree planting, which was time-consuming and labor-intensive, and added a burden to the local area.

　　时间不凑“三一二”　地点不再“吐鲁番”
    新疆区领导植树实事实做
    本报乌鲁木齐三月十一日电  记者曾坤报道：新疆维吾尔自治区主席铁木尔·达瓦买提日前说，从今年起，每逢植树节，区党政军领导不再像以往那样专程去春来早的吐鲁番植树，将按当地节气，实实在在种树。
    每年植树节，新疆大部分地区仍然天寒地冻。于是，区领导及厅局负责同志便驱车近四百里，专程到吐鲁番参加植树，费时费力，给当地增加了负担。
