Unheard of and Unseen
Strange Red Lights Appear in Argentina and Cuba at Night

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 15 - A compilation of reports from our correspondents in Buenos Aires and Havana: On the night of March 13, people in southern Argentina and Cuba witnessed an unusual red light.

In Bariloche, a city in the province of Río Negro in southern Argentina, many people saw the entire sky covered in a faint red hue around 10 PM on the 13th. This phenomenon lasted for approximately two hours.

On the same day, from 7 PM to 9 PM, almost the entire country of Cuba could see a colorful aurora borealis. According to eyewitnesses, starting from 7 PM, the aurora borealis would sometimes appear white, then yellow, then blue, then purple, and finally red. Locals said that seeing such an aurora borealis in the tropical region of Cuba at night was unprecedented.

Scientists from Argentina and Cuba believe that the aforementioned abnormal phenomena may be related to the intense activity within the sun that has been occurring since the beginning of the month.

　　闻所未闻　见所未见
    阿根廷古巴夜间出现异常红光
    新华社北京３月１５日电  综合本社驻布宜诺斯艾利斯和哈瓦那记者报道：在阿根廷南部和古巴，人们３月１３日夜看到一种异常的红光。
    在阿根廷南部内格罗河省的巴里洛切市，许多人在１３日夜２２时左右看到整个天空被淡红色所笼罩。这种景象持续了大约２小时。
    同一天１９时至２１时，几乎在古巴全国都可以看到五彩缤纷的北极光。据目击者说，从１９时开始，这种北极光时而呈白色、时而变为黄色、时而呈蓝色、时而呈紫色、时而又变成红色。当地人说，在地处热带的古巴夜间看到这种北极光前所未闻。
    阿根廷和古巴的科学家认为，上述异常现象可能与本月初以来太阳内部的剧烈活动有关。
