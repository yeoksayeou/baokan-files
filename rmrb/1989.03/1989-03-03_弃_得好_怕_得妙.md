Title: "Abandonment" Done Well, "Fear" Done Brilliantly

According to reports, Hebei Province Governor Yue Qifeng recently voluntarily gave up his "approval slip authority." Previously, he had the authority to approve expenditures of up to 300,000 yuan per time. However, during the exercise of this power, the governor felt there were many drawbacks and believed it was not appropriate to continue with personal discretion. Therefore, he voluntarily "abandoned" this authority. This power was indeed "abandoned" well and brilliantly! I couldn't help but exclaim, "Would another one like this be possible!"

The dividing line between a sound legal system and an unsound one lies in how power is exercised—whether it is through personal dictatorship or democratic consultation and voting. Especially in our socialist country, almost all production and consumption resources, as well as the control of currency, are concentrated in the hands of party and government leaders. If strict management systems are not established and effective democratic supervision is lacking, and if the governor continues to approve expenditures with "approval slips," it would inevitably open the door to corruption, "official profiteering," and "official theft," as well as to corrupt officials. Many loopholes in today's economic domain stem from this anti-democratic tradition of "chief approval slips." Those lawbreakers only need to obtain, persuade, or deceive a chief's approval slip, and they can pass through as if they have a "royal decree," easily selling off resources worth millions of yuan or evading taxes to act as compradors. Therefore, it is necessary to pass legislation to transfer the authority to control resources from "chief approval slips" to elected legislative bodies, such as the standing committees of people's congresses at various levels, which can only approve projects and expenditures by a majority or absolute majority vote. I recall that Western media once reported that France's Pompidou, Giscard d'Estaing, and Mitterrand, three presidents, all had plans to renovate the Élysée Palace. However, the parliament did not allocate funds, and the three presidents "had the will but not the money," so they had to give up. Former U.S. President Reagan wanted to provide financial aid to the Nicaraguan anti-government forces but failed to secure funds because Congress did not allocate them. If such things happened in China, as long as the chief signs off, the money would be in hand! Therefore, some lawbreakers specifically study and ponder how to get the chief to "approve slips." Now, the Hebei governor no longer approves, and others have no way in. "Reform means the transfer of certain powers," so this is indeed a major event in political and economic system reform, and a powerful measure to improve the economic environment.

In response to the Hebei governor, Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji recently said when asked how to ensure the implementation of Shanghai's anti-corruption regulations: "I am most afraid that I myself cannot strictly abide by the rules." (Approximate meaning, no specific source to verify) What a brilliant, accurate, and touching response! It is precisely what we lack the most and thus the most precious. If every leader could "reflect on oneself three times a day" and "fear" whether oneself and one's family members have engaged in power-seeking behavior, it would truly be fortunate for the country and the people! I hope Mayor Zhu will always "fear" and hope that every leader will always "fear." As the saying goes, "If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked." Conversely, as long as the upper beam is straight, there is no need to fear the lower beam being crooked. How is this said? The logic is self-evident: only leaders who abide by the law themselves have the right, courage, and confidence to punish their subordinates who violate laws and discipline.

One governor "abandoned" well, one mayor "feared" well. I wish there were more such governors and mayors. The more such "officials" there are, the more hope there is for revitalizing China, and the more confidence there is in the "Four Modernizations"!

### “弃”得好　“怕”得妙

    “弃”得好　“怕”得妙

    据报道：河北省省长岳岐峰同志最近自动放弃了“批条权”。在此之前，他本享有每次不超过30万元的“批条权”。但在施行这项权力的过程中，这位省长感到弊端多，认为不宜再搞个人独断。于是，他就主动“弃权”了。这个权实在“弃”得好，“弃”得妙！我禁不住高呼：“再来一个要不要！”
    法制健全不健全的分水岭就在看如何施行权力上，是个人专权，还是民主协商和表决。尤其在我们社会主义国家，几乎全社会的生产资料和消费资料以及货币的支配，都集中在党政机关领导人手中，如果不建立严格的管理制度，如果缺乏有效的民主监督，而一味由省长“批条子”去支配全民的财富，那就难免给营私舞弊，给“官倒”和“官盗”以及贪官污吏大开绿灯。我们今天经济领域的许多漏洞就出自这种“首长批条子”的反民主传统。那些不法之徒，只要求得、磨得或者骗得一张首长批的条子，就如有了“圣旨”一般通行无阻，动辄就能倒卖价值千百万元的物资，或逃避税收去作洋买办。因此，必须通过立法，把财物支配大权从“首长批条”转移到民选的立法机构，比如各级人民代表大会的常务委员会，由人民代表机构以多数或绝对多数票通过才能立项、开支。曾记得西方报刊有一次报道说：法国的蓬皮杜、德斯坦和密特朗三届总统都有过修缮爱丽舍宫的打算。但议会不拨款，三位总统“心有余而钱不足”，只好作罢。美国前总统里根很想给尼加拉瓜反政府武装以财政援助，也因国会不拨款而始终搞不到钱。这类事情如果在我们中国，只要首长大笔一挥，早就钞票到手了！因此有些不法之徒就专门琢磨，推敲如何使首长“批条子”。而今，河北省长不批了，“弃权”了，别人也就无孔可钻了。“改革意味着某些权力的转移”，可见，这实在是政治和经济体制改革中的一件大事，也是治理经济环境的一项有力措施。
    同河北省长遥相呼应的是上海市长朱熔基同志。不久前，有朋友问朱市长：如何才能保证上海市廉政法规的实施？我们这位市长回答说：“我最怕的是我自己能不能严格遵守。”（大意，手头无资料，未核实）真是回答得妙！中肯、坦率、感人，算得上一句至理名言！身为领导，能严格律己，首先律己，这正是我们最缺乏的，因而也是最可贵的。如果我们每个领导者都能“吾日三省吾身”，“怕”一下自己和自己的家庭成员有没有以权谋私行为，那可真是国家幸甚、人民幸甚！希望朱市长永远“怕”下去，更希望每个身为领导者的同志也永远“怕”下去。俗话说：“上梁不正下梁歪。”反过来说，只要上梁摆得正，就不怕下梁歪。此话怎讲？此理不言自明：只有自己遵纪守法的领导者，才有资格、有勇气和有信心去制裁其下属的违法乱纪者。
    一位省长“弃”得好，一位市长“怕”得好。但愿能多有些这样的省长和市长。这样的“长字号”干部越多，振兴中华越有希望，“四化”大业越有信心！
