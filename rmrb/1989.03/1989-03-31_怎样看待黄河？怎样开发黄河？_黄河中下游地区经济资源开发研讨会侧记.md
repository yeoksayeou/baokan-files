At the symposium on the economic resource development of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, held by the Henan Provincial Academy of Social Sciences and other units, the following ideas proposed by the attendees are quite enlightening.

		Is the Yellow River Only a Disaster River?

The Yellow River, is it a disaster river, or a beneficial river? Some say it is a genuine disaster river; others say it cannot be generalized as a disaster river. This symposium raised the question, "Is the Yellow River a disaster river?" Indeed, for many years, the Yellow River has been China's first major disaster river. However, it cannot be denied that the Yellow River also has its beneficial aspects. The Yellow River itself is a rich resource that can be developed.

The Yellow River has abundant hydropower resources, and multiple large-scale hydropower stations can be built. The Yellow River has abundant water resources, with hundreds of billions of cubic meters of water flowing down each year, which can not only irrigate farmland and transport sediment but also provide rare high-quality industrial and domestic water for coastal cities. The vast riverbanks and sandy wastelands created by historical Yellow River floods and changes in course are land resources that can be developed and utilized. The large amount of sediment flowing down from the upper reaches of the Yellow River each year contains abundant nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, with the nitrogen content equivalent to the total annual production of nitrogen fertilizer in the country, which can be used to create soil and fertilize fields.

		Flood Control and Development Hand in Hand

Managing the Yellow River, is it flood control or development? In the past, it was mainly flood control; now, it is necessary to focus on development. It seems that flood control and development should go hand in hand, with development subordinated to flood control.

Developing the Yellow River, the opinions of the attendees can be summarized in one point: diversification. The middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River have complex situations and varying conditions, and the development of the Yellow River can only start from reality, adapt to local conditions, and adapt to the times, without being confined to a single format, and with diverse approaches. Generally speaking, there are three aspects: agricultural areas along the Yellow River, industrial belts along the Yellow River, and tourist groups along the Yellow River. For each aspect, there are also diverse approaches. In agricultural areas, it is suitable for agriculture, suitable for forestry, suitable for animal husbandry, and suitable for fisheries. Particularly worth mentioning is the development of fruit farming in the vast sandy wastelands along the Yellow River, which has obvious economic and social benefits. For example, the afforestation work in Shandong Province has achieved remarkable results, not only expanding the forest coverage but also increasing the timber reserves. Focusing on this aspect of development is a far-sighted move.

		More Global Perspective

Developing the Yellow River involves the relationship between the whole and the parts. The development of the Yellow River, of course, is the development of various regions, various aspects, and various units. However, various regions, aspects, and units cannot develop in isolation. There must be both local actions and a global blueprint, both short-term plans and long-term strategies. Short-term behavior and individual actions will inevitably lead to serious consequences. For example, the utilization of Yellow River water resources requires a comprehensive arrangement and long-term planning. The water resources of the Yellow River are abundant but also scarce, and the supply-demand contradiction is becoming increasingly prominent. If the middle and upper reaches use too much, the lower reaches will be insufficient, and if agriculture uses too much, industry will be insufficient. Again, for example, the utilization of the riverbank lands inside the dikes, if too much emphasis is placed on grain production, it will affect flood control, and the two must be balanced. At the meeting, some representatives proposed using riverbank grasslands to raise cattle and geese, which can achieve both economic and social benefits, which is a new approach that considers the overall situation. The development of the Yellow River needs more such new ideas.

　　怎样看待黄河？怎样开发黄河？        
    ——黄河中下游地区经济资源开发研讨会侧记
    在河南省社会科学院等单位召开的黄河中下游地区经济资源开发研讨会上，与会代表提出的下述几个思想很有启发。
    　　　　黄河仅仅是害河吗？
    黄河，是害河，还是利河？有人说是地地道道的害河；也有人讲，不能笼统地说是害河。这次会上，有人又提出了“黄河是害河吗？”的疑问。的确，多少年来，黄河是中国的第一大害河。但不可否认，黄河也有其利的一面，黄河本身就是可供开发的丰富资源。
    黄河有丰富的水力资源，可以兴建多级大型水电站。黄河有丰富的水资源，每年流下的几百亿立方米水，不仅可以灌溉农田，输送泥沙，而且可以给沿海大中城市提供难得的优质工业用水和生活用水。历史上黄河泛滥和改道造成的大片河滩及沙荒地，是可以开发利用的土地资源。黄河上游每年流下的大量泥沙，含有丰富的氮磷钾，其含氮量相当于全国年产氮肥的总产量，可以用来造地肥田。
    　　　　防洪与开发并举
    治理黄河，是防洪，还是开发？过去，主要是防洪；现在，要注重开发。看来，防洪与开发应并举，开发要服从防洪。
    开发黄河，与会代表的意见，归结到一点就是多样化。黄河中下游各地区，情况复杂，条件各异，开发黄河只能从实际出发，因地制宜，因时制宜，不拘一格，多种多样。大致说来，不外三个方面、沿黄农业区，沿黄工业带，沿黄旅游群。就每个方面说，亦是多种多样。在农业区是宜农则农，宜林则林，宜牧则牧，宜渔则渔。特别值得提及的，是利用沿黄大片沙荒地发展林果业，具有明显的经济社会效益。如山东省的绿化工作，成绩就十分显著，不仅扩大了林木覆盖率，而且增加了木材的积蓄量。致力于这方面的开发，是极有远见之举。
    　　　　多一些全局性
    开发黄河，有个全局与局部的关系问题。黄河开发，当然是各个地区、各个方面、各个单位的开发，但是，各地区、各方面、各单位不能各自孤立地开发，既要有局部的举动，也要有全局的蓝图，既要有近期的方案，又要有长期的战略。短期行为，各自行事，必将造成严重的后果。比如，黄河水资源的利用，就要有全盘的安排，长期的打算。黄河的水资源是丰富的，又是短缺的，水的供需矛盾日趋突出，中上游用多了，下游就不足，农业用多了，工业就不足。又如黄河堤内滩地的利用，过分看重粮食，就会影响防洪，二者必须兼顾。会上，有的代表提出利用河滩草地养牛、养鹅，可兼得经济、社会效益，就是一种兼顾全局的新思路。开发黄河，需要更多的这样的新思路。
