The Communist Party Committee of Liu Pan Shi City in Guizhou Province recently decided to implement three systems—recusal, declaration, and transparency—in the city's party and government organs. This aims to ensure that clean government is put into practice and welcomes supervision from all sectors of society.

The main contents of these three systems are as follows:

Recusal System: Members of the Party Committee, government, and other leading cadres should recuse themselves when discussing issues related to their own or their relatives' arrangements, rewards, and punishments. The spouses and children of principal leading cadres should not be appointed to leading positions in the region's or unit's discipline inspection, supervision, organizational personnel departments, and procuratorial and judicial organs. The spouses and children of other leading cadres should not be assigned to work in departments directly led by the individual.

Declaration System: This year, it will first be implemented for the issue of private housing for cadres. Cadres and their family members who build private houses should declare in advance to the organization the location, standards, building materials, source of funds, and purpose of the house. Deputy county-level and above cadres should declare to the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government; county-level and deputy section-level cadres should declare to the County Party Committee and County Government; other cadres should declare to the party and government leaders of their respective units.

Transparency System: Departments and units that manage law enforcement, adjudication, and other powers, except for individual cases involving state secrets, should publicize the rules, procedures, results, and deadlines for handling matters. The amount of taxes and fines, the distribution of relief grain and funds, the supply of scarce products and daily necessities, recruitment, employment, military recruitment, and the allocation and use of materials should all be made public within a certain scope to facilitate supervision.

　　六盘水市委三项制度促廉政
    一回避二申报三公开
    本报贵阳３月８日电  中共贵州省六盘水市委最近决定，市党政机关实行回避、申报和办事公开三项制度，使廉政落到实处，并欢迎各界群众监督。
    这三项制度的主要内容是——
    回避制度：党委、政府及其他领导班子成员在研究自己或亲友的安排、奖惩等问题时，当事者应回避；主要领导干部的配偶和子女，不得安排在本地区、本单位的纪检、监察、组织人事部门和检察、审判机关担任领导工作；其他领导干部的配偶和子女，也不安排在本人直接领导的部门工作。
    申报制度：今年先在干部私人建房问题上实行。干部及其家属修建私房，应事先将建房地点、标准、建筑材料和资金来源、房屋用途等向组织申报。副县级以上干部向市委、市政府申报；正副区（科）级干部向县委、县政府申报；其他干部向所在单位党政领导申报。
    办事公开制度：掌管执法、审判等权力的部门和单位，除个别涉及国家机密的以外，要把办事的规章、程序、结果、期限等公布于众。税费、罚款的数量，救济粮款的发放，紧俏产品、生活物资的供应，招生招干招工征兵，财物的指标及使用等，凡是可公开的，都要在一定范围公开，便于接受监督。
