Actor Zhou Lijing caused a traffic accident on February 26, and then assaulted the victim. The capital's media outlets have widely reported and commented on the incident.

That day at around 10 AM, Beijing Post and Telecommunications Bureau employee Dai Baowen and his wife, who was carrying a child, were crossing the western entrance of Xidan Xiaoshihu Hutong. Zhou Lijing had just started his right-turning "Dacia" car, which hit Dai's right thigh. Dai hit the car hood with the bag in his hand and shouted, "How are you driving this car?" Zhou got out of the car and shouted at Dai, "You're hitting my car, I'll beat you up!" He then pushed Dai to the ground twice. Dai's wife stepped in to protect him and was also pushed by Zhou. Zhou threatened, "I'll beat you. I have money, if I injure you, I'll pay for your treatment." According to Beijing Post and Telecommunications Hospital's diagnosis, Dai's right buttock soft tissue was contused.

West District traffic police confirmed that Zhou did not have a driver's license and the car had no license plate. The car was impounded for further investigation.

　　周里京交通肇事　新闻界纷纷评说
    本报讯  电影演员周里京２月２６日开车撞人后，又动手打伤了被撞者。首都新闻界对此纷纷报道和评说。
    这天１０点多，北京电报局职工戴保文与怀抱小孩的妻子穿行西单小石虎胡同西口。周里京刚启动右行的“达奇亚”牌小轿车撞了戴的右大腿。戴用手中的布袋拍了一下车头，喊道：“你这车是怎么开的？”周下车后冲着戴嚷道：“砸我车，我揍你！”说完，连推了戴两个跟头。戴妻上前拦护，也挨了周的一个推掌。周扬言：“就打你。我有钱，打伤了我给治。”经北京邮电医院诊断，戴右臀部软组织被挫伤。
    西单交通民警证实，周无驾驶执照，车也没牌照，先扣其车待查处。
