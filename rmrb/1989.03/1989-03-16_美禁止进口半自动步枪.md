Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 14th.

The Bush administration today announced an immediate ban on the import of semi-automatic rifles. It is estimated that 110,000 rifles, for which importers had already applied, will be affected by this ban.

Since the serious shooting incident in California on January 17th, calls for stricter gun control have been growing nationwide. Yesterday, the California legislature passed a bill banning the personal ownership of semi-automatic rifles. The Bush administration's decision came against this backdrop.

　　美禁止进口半自动步枪
    本报华盛顿３月１４日电  布什政府今天宣布立即禁止进口半自动步枪。估计进口商已经申请进口的１１万支枪将因此停止进口。
    自从今年１月１７日加利福尼亚州发生严重枪杀事件后，全国要求加强枪支控制的呼声不断。昨天，加州议会通过一项禁止个人拥有半自动步枪的法案。布什政府的上述决定是在这种背景下产生的。
