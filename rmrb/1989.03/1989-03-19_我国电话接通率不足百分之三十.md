The connection rate for local telephone calls in China is less than 30%, while the connection rate for long-distance calls is only around 20%, said Zhang Ligui, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.

The fundamental reason is that communication capacity is severely insufficient, and construction and development cannot keep up with social demand. Additionally, the telecommunications department has not fully and effectively utilized the already built networks and communication equipment, resulting in low overall network operating efficiency.

He believes that the reasons for the low network operating efficiency can be summarized into four aspects. First, call volume is concentrated. Users tend to make calls in the morning or within two hours after starting work in the afternoon, causing communication trunk lines and local exchange machines to operate at full capacity, leading to congestion. Second, users are not familiar with the correct methods of using the telephone. When the called party does not answer or the line is busy, the caller repeatedly dials the number, occupying long-distance circuits for a long time, causing the precious long-distance circuits to perform "useless work." Third, some long-distance telephone exchanges arbitrarily change numbers or upgrade positions, and some cities or units expand telephone capacity without prior notification or publicity, resulting in a large number of users dialing the wrong numbers, occupying a large amount of circuits. Fourth, departmentalism within the postal and telecommunications enterprises is at play. Some exchanges located on long-distance trunk lines, in order to ensure the smooth flow of long-distance calls within their region, artificially close the long-distance circuits of the terminal exchanges, causing communication interruptions in the regions where the terminal exchanges are located.

### 我国电话接通率不足百分之三十

　　我国电话接通率不足百分之三十
    邮电部电信总局局长张立贵说，目前，我国市内电话接通率不到３０％，而长途电话接通率仅在２０％左右。
    根本原因是通信能力严重不足，建设和发展跟不上社会的需求。其次，电信部门对已建成的网络和通信设备没能充分、有效地利用，全网运行效率比较低。
    他认为全网运行效率低的原因大致有四个方面。第一，话务量集中。用户习惯在早晨或下午上班后两小时打电话，使通信干线和市话交换机满负荷，形成阻塞。第二，用户不熟悉正确使用电话的方法。在被呼叫方无人接或电话忙时，呼叫人连续挂拨电话，长时间挤占长途电路，使宝贵的长途电路进行“无效劳动”。第三，有些长途电话局随意改号、升位，一些城市或单位扩大电话容量，既不提前通报，也不作宣传，致使大批用户用错码呼叫，占用了大量电路。第四，邮电企业内部的本位主义作怪。一些处于长途干线上的汇接局，为了保证本地区内的长话畅通，人为地关闭末端局的长途电路，使末端局所在地区通信中断。
