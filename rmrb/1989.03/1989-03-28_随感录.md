Random Thoughts

    (1)
    Those who demand perfection from reformers are infinitely tolerant of critics.
    They set a "perfect standard" for reformers, and thus those who specialize in criticism have a stick to beat others with. This stick can always hit someone, because those who work hard are never perfect, and because they are busy working and neglect to defend themselves.

    (2)
    “Can you guarantee that you won’t fail in what you do?” Who can guarantee no failure? Thus, there is a reason to do nothing.
    We do things by first considering whether there is a possibility of success. As long as the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, we persist.

    (3)
    Interpersonal relationships and respect for elders are paramount, while truth and justice are secondary. For the sake of relationships, sometimes truth and justice can be “ignored.” Offending someone is a big taboo, while offending the truth is a minor taboo, or even no taboo at all.
    “How can you speak to a respected person in such a tone?” He does not ask whether the speaker’s words are close to the truth or contain bitter grains of truth.

    (4)
    In terms of expression, it is better to have hypocritical humility than straightforward honesty. This makes it difficult for people to understand each other’s true thoughts, requiring a lot of guesswork. Even in the hottest summer, the soul wears a cotton-padded jacket. This is one reason why Chinese people live so tiredly.
    Chinese people do not emphasize packaging on products, but they overemphasize packaging on thoughts. There are those who do not emphasize packaging, but after suffering losses, they have learned to be clever.

    (5)
    “Elevating to the highest level” was once a highly developed mode of thinking. At that time, there was the general line of class struggle, and many “sub-lines.” Besides the “lines,” there were “threads,” making it easy to elevate. There were many places to elevate.
    Thus, the equation was formed: analysis = elevating to the highest level = criticism.
    This mode of thinking has not yet disappeared today: you mention a problem, and before he has even heard the details, he starts elevating it. Who knows how high he elevates it to, but elevating to the highest level does not need to follow the “sufficient reason law.” Thus, there are always scholars who, after writing, have to strive for a higher level in their statements.

    (6)
    Some people deduce from a few ready-made “laws,” considering this “thinking.” Before and after, they do not humbly observe reality or objectively listen to others. These “laws” are numerous. Such as: “The rich must be ruthless,” “Youth must be radical,” “The elderly must be rigid,” “Exploration must produce heresy,” “Scholars must be poor”...
    These “laws” are often expanded and personified: the factory director represents “productive forces,” the secretary represents “ideological work,” old cadres represent “revolutionary traditions,” young people represent “blindly following the West”...
    Thus, when one person observes another, after hearing a few words from the other, he starts categorizing: either the “rigid” type or the “liberalization” type... Thus, there is nothing specific, only “lines” and “threads,” and those ready-made “laws.” The mind has only a few boxes, how can inspiration not be exhausted? How can analysis be specific?

    (7)
    Emphasizing purity one-sidedly, opposing inclusiveness and multiculturalism, often leads to a single and fragile thinking pattern. Qin Shi Huang’s burning of books and burying of scholars, and Emperor Wu of Han’s abolition of a hundred schools of thought in favor of Confucianism, may be the beginning. This is one of the reasons for China’s long-term stagnation.
    Inclusiveness is not a hodgepodge or a blend, but a thinking mechanism that is beneficial to development. Only inclusiveness can compete and compare, can “tolerate practice to distinguish, giving small new thoughts the opportunity to grow.”
    A non-inclusive culture is a single culture. A single culture will “create” a fragile national psychology, “create” a fragile state.
    The broader the source of thinking nutrients, the greater the scope of thinking, the greater the ability to think.

　　随感录
    （一）
    求全责备于改革的人，无限宽容于挑剔的人。
    给改革者定了一个“完美的标杆”，于是那些专门挑剔的人，便有了打人的杆子。这杆子总可以打人的，因为实干的人总不会是完美的，更因为他忙于干事疏于防备。
    　　　　（二）
    “你们干事情，是否保证不失败？”谁能保证不失败？于是有理由什么事也不干。
    我们干事情，先想有无成功的可能，只要利大于弊，就坚持干下去。
    　　　　（三）
    人际关系、尊卑长幼为首要，真理是非则为次要，为了关系有时是非可以“不要”。冒犯谁，是大忌，冒犯真理，是小忌，甚至无忌。
    “你怎么能用这样的语气同尊者说话？”他并不问言者说的内容是否接近真理，或者含着苦涩的真理的颗粒。
    　　　　（四）
    在表达方式上，宁可要虚伪的谦逊，不要直率的诚实。这使人们彼此了解真实思想时要花费很大精力去猜测。其灵魂，即令是三伏天也穿着棉皮大衣。这是中国人活得太累的原因之一。
    中国人在商品上不讲究包装，在思想上却过分讲究包装。原也有不讲包装的，但因吃了亏，也学乖了。
    　　　　（五）
    上纲，曾在一个时期成为最发达的思维方式。那时有阶级斗争总纲，还有许多“分纲”，除了“纲”，还有“线”，因而上起来很容易，有的是地方上。
    于是形成这样的等式：分析＝上纲＝批判。
    这样的思维方式如今并未绝迹：你说一个问题，那件事情他还没听清，便开始往上提了，上纲多高不晓得，反正上纲是不需要遵守“充足理由律”的。于是总有掌笔的秀才在写好之后又不得不在提法上力求其高度。
    　　　　（六）
    在若干现成的“定律”中推断，一些人即把它当成“思考”，此前，此后，没有虚心地体察实际，没有客观地倾听对方。这些“定律”，一划拉一大把。诸如：“为富必定不仁”，“青年必然偏激”，“年老必定僵化”，“探索必出异端”，“文人必须贫穷”……
    这些“定律”又常常扩大并形象化和人格化：厂长代表“生产力”，书记代表“思想工作”，老干部代表“革命传统”，小青年代表“迷信西方”……
    于是，一个人观察另一个人，听了对方几句话就开始给人家归类了，或“僵化”型，或“自由化”型，……于是什么具体的东西都没有了，只有“纲”和“线”，还有那些现成的“定律”。脑中就那几个方格，灵感思维怎能不枯竭？分析怎能做到具体？
    　　　　（七）
    片面地强调纯洁，一味地反对兼容并包和多元文化，常常造成思维定式的单一和脆弱。秦皇焚书坑儒禁止争鸣，汉武罢黜百家，独尊儒术恐为其发端。这是造成中国社会长期停滞的原因之一。
    兼容并非杂烩和调合，而是一种有利发展的思维机制。兼容才可以竞争、比较，可以“容忍实践去鉴别，给弱小的新思维以成长的机会”。
    非兼容的文化是单一的文化，单一文化将“造就”脆弱的国民心理，“造就”脆弱的国家。
    思维的养料源有多广，思维的跨度有多大，思维的能力就有多大。
