The results of the Yanwu Essay Contest were announced today. We sincerely thank the more than 15,000 authors who enthusiastically participated and the broad readership. We also express our deepest gratitude to the Yancity Radio Factory for their enthusiastic cooperation and strong support.

This essay contest used a scoring system for evaluation. Twelve judges scored the 88 published works individually, and then the scores were tallied. The top 30 works were selected based on the total scores. According to the contest rules, there are five first prizes, ten second prizes, and fifteen third prizes. We will award certificates and prize money to the winners and extend our congratulations in advance.

Among the winning authors, there are well-known essayists such as Qin Mu, as well as famous writers from other literary genres like Wang Meng, Lu Wenfu, Wang Zengqi, Liu Xinhua, Gong Liu, Bao Chang, Jia Pingwa, and Fan Zeng. There are also old friends from "Dadi" and "Literary Works," as well as new authors who are participating for the first time. Particularly noteworthy is the group of grassroots amateur authors, such as Hu Zhaomu, Yang Yutang, Lin Yin, Xing Xiuling, Zhang Xianbin, Chen Sizhang, and Zhang Zhengping, who won awards in this contest. Although their works may still be somewhat immature in terms of language and technique, they are rich in the breath of life, sincere, and unadorned. This once again proves that our essay writing should be rooted in the vast soil of life.

There are still many shortcomings in this essay contest we organized. We welcome criticism and suggestions from all authors and readers.

In response to the broad readership's request, the Yanwu Essay Contest will be compiled and published. In addition to the 88 published works, it will also include some high-quality works that were not published, totaling about 100 pieces.

　　致作者和读者
    燕舞散文征文评选今天揭晓了。我们谨向踊跃应征的一万五千余名作者和广大读者表示深切的感谢，向热忱与我们合作，给予我们大力支持的盐城无线电总厂表示深切的感谢。
    这次征文的评选，采取了计分法。先由１２名评委对已发表的８８篇作品分别打分，再将这些分数汇总，依据得分多少取前３０名获奖。根据征文规定，一等奖五名；二等奖十名；三等奖十五名。我们将向获奖者颁发证书和奖金，谨此先致贺忱。
    在获奖作者中，既有读者早已熟知的散文家，如秦牧，也有主要是从事其它文学创作的名家，如王蒙、陆文夫、汪曾祺、刘心武、公刘、鲍昌、贾平凹、范曾等；既有《大地》、《文学作品》的老朋友，也有与它们第一次结缘的新作者。尤其可喜的是，一批来自基层的业余作者，如胡昭穆、杨云堂、林荫、邢秀玲、张晏斌、陈四长、张征平等，在这次征文中获了奖。他们的作品尽管在文字和技法上还稍嫌稚嫩，但生活气息浓郁，不矫情，少雕饰。这再一次证明：我们的散文创作要进一步发展，还是应该扎根于广袤的生活厚土。
    我们举办的这次散文征文活动，还存在许多不足之处，欢迎广大作者和读者批评指正。
    应广大读者要求，燕舞散文征文将结集出版。除收集已发表的８８篇作品外，还将增补部分质量较好、未能刊出的征文作品，共计百篇左右。
