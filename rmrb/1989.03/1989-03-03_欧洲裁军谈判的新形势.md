The negotiations on the reduction of conventional forces in Europe are about to resume. Whether this time can break through the long-standing stalemate remains to be seen.

This round of negotiations has attracted more attention than before because of the new situation of unilateral arms reductions by the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union has announced that it will reduce its forces by 500,000 over the next two years in its own territory and Eastern Europe, and withdraw part of the weapons and equipment deployed in Eastern Europe. In coordination with the Soviet Union, Eastern European countries have also announced the reduction of their own conventional forces. So far, out of the seven Warsaw Pact countries including the Soviet Union, six have announced unilateral arms reductions to varying degrees. This situation is unprecedented in history and has attracted international attention.

According to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, they decided to unilaterally reduce their forces for two reasons: first, to adjust their military forces to make them more defensive; second, to further promote the détente process and facilitate the success of the talks on reducing conventional forces in Europe scheduled for March.

NATO countries have cautiously welcomed the unilateral arms reductions by the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe but have taken a negative stance on taking corresponding actions. NATO's reasoning is that the Warsaw Pact's military forces deployed in Europe are already numerically superior to NATO. It seems that NATO's response to this matter is quite passive. Because many Westerners also believe that although the actions of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe cannot fundamentally eliminate the imbalance of strength between the two military blocs, they will have a positive effect on the process of arms reduction and détente in Europe.

In early January, the follow-up meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) reached a compromise agreement on the target, form, and scope of the negotiations on conventional forces in Europe after a tough negotiation. It agreed to achieve stability and security in Europe through the establishment of a low-level balance of land-based conventional forces and effective and strict verification. The public opinion believes that this is the most significant progress since the Helsinki Conference in 1975, breaking the 14-year stalemate of balanced arms reduction in Central Europe.

It is precisely considering the above background, especially the current trend of easing international tensions, that people begin to hope for a new round of negotiations on the reduction of conventional armed forces in Europe. They hope that it can come out of the "dialogue of the deaf" and reach an arms reduction agreement that is conducive to peace and stability in Europe as soon as possible. At the same time, people are also aware that due to the decades-long severe confrontation between the two major military blocs in Europe and the difficulty in eliminating mutual distrust, the new round of negotiations will be a tough process of bargaining.

    欧洲裁军谈判的新形势
    方荣萱
    欧洲常规力量裁军谈判即将重开。这一次能否打破长期以来的僵局，人们拭目以待。
    此次谈判之所以比以往引人注目，是因为出现了苏联、东欧单方面裁军的新情况。苏联已宣布于今后两年内在本土和东欧裁军50万，并撤走部署在东欧的部分武器装备。与苏联协调行动，东欧国家也相继宣布裁减自己的常规部队。迄今，在包括苏联在内的华约7国中，已有6国宣布不同程度的单方面裁军。这种情况在历史上尚属首次，引起了国际舆论的注目。
    根据苏联、东欧方面的解释，他们决定单方面裁军，一是为了对自己军事力量作调整，使之具有“更多的防御性质”；二是“为了进一步推动缓和进程，促进3月份举行的裁减欧洲常规军备的会谈取得成功”。
    北约国家对苏联、东欧单方面裁军表示谨慎的欢迎，但对采取相应行动持否定态度。北约的理由是，华约部署在欧洲的军事力量在数量上本来就超过北约。看来，北约对此事的反应相当被动。因为，不少西方人士也认为，苏联和东欧的行动，虽然不能从根本上消除两大军事集团间的实力不平衡状态，但对欧洲的裁军与缓和进程会起积极推动作用。
    今年1月初举行的欧安会续会经过一番艰苦谈判，曾经就欧洲常规军力谈判的目标、形式和范围等授权问题达成妥协性一致，同意通过建立陆基常规力量低水平的均衡及有效和严格的核查来实现欧洲的稳定与安全。舆论认为，这是自1975年赫尔辛基会议以来进展最大的一次续会，打破了中欧均衡裁军14年无结果的局面。
    正是考虑到上述背景，特别是当前国际局势缓和的大趋势，人们开始对新的一轮欧洲常规武装力量裁军谈判寄予希望，希望它能从“聋子对话”的状态中走出来，早日达成有利于欧洲和平与稳定的裁军协议。与此同时，人们也意识到，由于欧洲两大军事集团几十年严重对峙、相互间的不信任难以一下子消除，新的一轮谈判将是一番艰苦的讨价还价。
