	The recent phenomenon of forcing enterprise workers to participate in savings and fundraising, which has occurred in many places across the country since last winter, has sparked strong reactions among workers.

	According to materials provided by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in recent times, some local banks in Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Guangxi, Hunan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia have issued mandatory savings targets to enterprises, forcibly deducting savings—deducting wages by a certain proportion and replacing them with various savings vouchers and reward tickets. Otherwise, workers will not be able to withdraw their wages in cash. It is understood that forced savings and fundraising have seriously affected workers' normal lives and the development of enterprise production.

	Recently, a responsible official from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions commented on this phenomenon, stating that while the union supports workers in participating in patriotic savings to support national construction, it firmly opposes the practice of forcing or indirectly forcing savings and fundraising. Banks mobilizing savings and social or enterprise fundraising should all adhere to the principle of voluntariness. Economic experts here believe that the practice of forced savings and fundraising is detrimental to the stability of workers' lives and the normal development of the economy and should be corrected.

　　全总负责人强调        
    不该强迫职工储蓄集资
    据新华社北京３月２４日电  （记者徐克洪 实习生文远新）强迫企业职工参加储蓄和集资，去冬今春以来，我国许多地方出现的这一现象，在职工中引起强烈反响。
    据中华全国总工会提供的资料，最近一段时间里，辽宁、黑龙江、山东、江苏、浙江、安徽、广西、湖南、陕西、甘肃、宁夏等地的一些地方银行纷纷向企业下达指令性储蓄指标，硬性扣储——按比例扣发工资，代之以各种储蓄存单和奖券，否则不予提取工资现款。据了解，强行储蓄和集资已严重影响了职工的正常生活和企业生产的发展。
    全总负责人最近就此现象指出，工会支持职工参加爱国储蓄，支援国家建设，但坚决反对强迫或变相强迫储蓄、集资的做法。银行动员储蓄以及社会集资或企业内部集资，都应坚持自愿的原则。此间经济界人士认为，强行储蓄和集资的做法，对职工生活的稳定和经济的正常发展有害无益，应当予以纠正。
