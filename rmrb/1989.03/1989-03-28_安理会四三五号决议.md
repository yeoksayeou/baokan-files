On December 22 of last year, Angola, Cuba, and South Africa formally signed a tripartite agreement in New York, setting April 1 of this year as the date for the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435. Namibia, the last remaining colony on the African continent under long-term South African occupation, will achieve independence.

Resolution 435 was adopted by the United Nations Security Council on September 29, 1978. Its main provisions are as follows: South African troops must withdraw from Namibia, ending their illegal rule; the United Nations Secretary-General will appoint a special representative to ensure that free and fair elections are held under UN supervision and control in Namibia; under the authorization of the Security Council, a United Nations Transition Assistance Group will be established for a period of 12 months to assist the Secretary-General's special representative; the resolution welcomes the signing of a ceasefire agreement between the South West Africa People's Organization and South Africa; and it opposes any unilateral actions taken by South Africa regarding the election procedures or the transfer of power.

Before the First World War, Namibia was a German colony. After the war, the League of Nations entrusted it to South Africa for administration. The South African authorities illegally annexed Namibia in 1949. Since then, the people of Namibia have been tirelessly fighting against foreign aggression and striving for national independence. However, for the past 10 years, South Africa has been obstructing the implementation of Resolution 435. After a year of negotiations, Angola, Cuba, and South Africa finally signed an agreement, setting a timetable for Namibia's independence.

　　安理会四三五号决议
    去年１２月２２日，安哥拉、古巴和南非在纽约正式签署了三方协定，确定今年的４月１日为实施安理会４３５号决议的日期。纳米比亚这个被南非长期占领的非洲大陆上最后一个殖民地将实现独立。
    ４３５号决议是１９７８年９月２９日由联合国安理会通过的，其主要内容是：南非军队从纳米比亚撤出，终止其非法统治；由联合国秘书长任命一特别代表，保证在联合国的监督控制下，在纳米比亚举行自由公正的选举；在安理会的授权下，设立一个为期１２个月的联合国过渡时期协助团，协助秘书长特别代表工作；欢迎西南非洲人民组织同南非签订停火协议；反对南非就选举程序或移交权力所采取的一切单方面措施。
    纳米比亚在第一次大战前曾是德国殖民地，战后国际联盟将它交给南非进行委任统治。南非当局在１９４９年非法吞并了纳米比亚。从此纳米比亚人民为反对外来侵略、争取民族独立进行了不懈的斗争。但１０年来，南非一直阻挠４３５号决议的实施。经过１年的会谈，安哥拉、古巴和南非终于签署了协议，确定了纳米比亚实施独立的时间表。
