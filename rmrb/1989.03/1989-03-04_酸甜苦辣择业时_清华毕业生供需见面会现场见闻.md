The three-day job allocation meeting for Tsinghua University's 1989 graduates concluded today.

	“Opening with a bang” are the female students

The main hall of the school building was packed with people.

On the morning of the 1st, the first students from the Radio Department to reach an agreement with employers and sign a contract were two female students. Graduate student Zhou Wei and Tianjin native undergraduate Liang Zhongli were both recruited by the Second Academy of the Aerospace Industry. The teacher in charge of guiding students' employment, Gui Yuzong, happily said, "I was worried about the female students' allocation. Today, the first to sign up in our department are two female students, it seems the situation is optimistic."

	Joint ventures are popular

The Beijing Foreign Enterprise Service Company is recruiting graduates for foreign enterprises' offices in China. Such units are currently the hot spots for students' employment, with several hundred people signing up. These units conduct on-the-spot English oral exams. Many students, who have been studying foreign languages for years, eagerly stepped forward to show off their skills. Of course, there are also those who are not impressed. Electrical Engineering graduate student Ma Yujie thinks, "Just by saying a few words, can it really reflect one's English level?"

The China Nonferrous Metals and Minerals Import and Export Corporation is another hot spot, and students with related majors are all eager to sign up.

	This factory has a big appetite

The Fushan Radio Factory No. 8, located in the Pearl River Delta, attracted 300 students. Its advertisement prominently reads, "As long as the major matches, students from all over the country are welcome," "We will take as many doctoral students as possible."

A few days ago, this factory had already set up camp in Tsinghua. Students had already heard that the factory's "Galaxy" audio equipment is a leader in the country, has high economic benefits, and graduate students can get a two-bedroom apartment... Despite the fact that the factory's booth was almost crushed by the crowd, the reception staff patiently answered students' questions.

	The troubles of students from other provinces

Seven or eight graduate students from the Electrical Engineering Department, whose hometowns are outside Beijing, gathered at the sign-up counter, unanimously complaining, "Some units in Beijing only recruit Beijing students and do not want those from other provinces, such competition is not fair." "Beijing students who study poorly can still stay, but students from other provinces, no matter how well they study, cannot enter Beijing."

	Everyone has a hard time

For this, the reporter interviewed the person in charge of graduate allocation at the State Education Commission. He believes: There is indeed a problem of unfair competition opportunities. Now, the allocation work cannot be entirely rigid or entirely liberal, the difficulty is great. If it is entirely liberal, Beijing can absorb all of Tsinghua's graduates. But Tsinghua is the Tsinghua of the whole country, not just Beijing's Tsinghua, it should face the whole country. Moreover, due to population issues and housing shortages, Beijing cannot possibly take in so many students from other provinces. The state, employers, and students all have a hard time! A student who has not found an ideal unit said, "In the vast world, among the masses, people cannot have the opportunity to show themselves at the same time. However, when the opportunity comes, do not miss it..."

### 酸甜苦辣择业时——清华毕业生供需见面会现场见闻

　　酸甜苦辣择业时
    ——清华毕业生供需见面会现场见闻
    本报记者  蒋涵箴
    清华大学１９８９年毕业生分配供需见面会为期３天，今天闭会。
    　　　　“开门红”的是女生
    学校主楼大厅人山人海。
    １日上午，无线电系最早与用人单位谈妥并签订协议书的，是两名女生。研究生周伟及天津籍的本科生梁忠莉都被航空航天部二院要去了。在场负责指导学生就业的桂裕宗老师乐呵呵地说：“我就担心女生分配。今天，我系打头炮的是两名女生，看来形势是乐观的。”
    　　　　合资企业受青睐
    北京外国企业服务公司代外资企业在中国的办事处招收毕业生。这样的单位，是目前学生就职的热点，大约有好几百人报名。这些单位要当场口试英语。许多学生几年来苦读外语，今天争相上前露一手。当然，也有人对此不以为然，电机系女研究生马幼捷认为：“就凭这样说两句，能真正反映外语水平？”
    中国五金矿产进出口公司也是一个热点，只要专业与它沾些边的同学，都争相报名。
    　　　　这个工厂胃口真大
    位于珠江三角洲的佛山无线电八厂，吸引了３００名同学。它的广告牌上，引人注目地写着：“只要专业对口，全国各地的同学都要”，“博士生有多少要多少”。
    几天之前，这个厂就在清华“安营扎寨”。同学们早已听说该厂的“银河牌”音响设备，是国内的佼佼者，经济效益高，研究生去能分到两房一厅……尽管这家工厂的摊位快要挤塌了，接待人员仍是耐心地解答同学们的问题。
    　　　　外地学生的苦恼
    电机系七八名老家在外地的研究生围在报名处，异口同声地发牢骚：“北京市的一些单位只招北京学生，不要外地的，这样的竞争机会不平等。”“北京学生学得不好也能留下，外地生学得再好也进不了北京。”
    　　　　都有一本难念的经
    为此，记者采访了国家教委主管毕业生分配的负责同志。他认为：确实存在着竞争机会不公平的问题。现在分配工作既不能统死，也不能全部放开，难度较大。如果要全部放开，北京能消化掉清华的全部毕业生。可清华是全国的清华，不是北京的清华，它要面向全国。再说北京由于人口问题、住房紧张，也不可能进这么多外地学生。国家、用人单位、学生都有一本难念的经！一位未找到理想单位的同学说：“大千世界，芸芸众生，人不可能同时得到展示的机会。然而，当机会来时，千万别错过……”
