A unique "Panda World" has recently been completed in Fuzhou Zoo and opened to the public during the Spring Festival.

At the top of the big dream mountain inside the park, green bamboo contrasts with a pyramid-shaped panda gymnasium. The less than two-year-old panda princess "Rongrong" often practices shooting hoops, riding a stationary bike, and crossing a balance beam here, her movements graceful and effortless, leaving spectators in stitches. Behind the gymnasium is a panda activity area covering more than ten thousand square meters, where ancient banyan trees and pine trees provide shade. A surrounding wall encloses the area. The pandas play and frolic here, experiencing a life close to nature. It is understood that a panda archive, a panda art gallery, and a panda hospital will be built here in the future.

　　福州熊猫喜迁新居
    中新社讯  记者陈国明报道：别具一格的“熊猫世界”最近在福州动物园建成，并于新春时节对外开放。
    园内大梦山顶，绿竹映衬着一座金字塔型的熊猫体育馆。不到两岁的熊猫公主“榕榕”，常在这里投篮、踏车、跨晃板，动作潇洒自如，观者无不捧腹。体育馆背后是一片面积万余平方米的熊猫活动场所，松树古榕遮天蔽日，一道围墙环绕四周。熊猫们在这里嬉戏玩耍，体验重返大自然的生活。据了解，这里还将陆续兴建熊猫档案馆、熊猫艺术馆和熊猫医院。
