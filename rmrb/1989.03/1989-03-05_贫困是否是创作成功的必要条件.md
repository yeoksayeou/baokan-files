Is poverty a necessary condition for creative success? Dan Zhengping wrote in the first issue of 1989's *Tianjin Literature* that the idea that "literature hates prosperity" and "poetry is refined through poverty" has been emphasized for decades in literary history and literary theory textbooks. Almost all writers believe in this notion. Historically, poverty has indeed nurtured a great number of outstanding writers, but there are also many who, despite being of noble birth, holding high positions, and enjoying generous salaries, have become masters and famous writers. Du Fu and Cao Xueqin, for example, became great writers after experiencing extreme poverty, but they also once enjoyed luxurious and extravagant lives. A life of complete, lifelong poverty is unlikely to produce a poet.

Artistic creation requires at least basic material conditions for survival. Only after meeting the practical needs of clothing, food, shelter, and transportation can one engage in artistic and other activities. Artistic creation requires a rich cultural background, and acquiring such a background requires substantial economic conditions.

Unfortunately, we, who have always glorified poverty, have overlooked this phenomenon. We focus only on the hardworking poets like Jia Dao and the impoverished writers like Wu Jingzi, Cao Xueqin, and Pu Songling, believing that poverty plus effort equals success, as if it were the only way to cultivate writers.

It is this absurd belief that has led many talented and potential individuals to seal themselves off in poverty, meditating and practicing, hoping for the arrival of the goddess of luck, and thus distancing themselves further from the surging tide of life filled with desires. It is also this misconception that has led many young people, who lack talent but rely on poverty and diligence, to blindly devote themselves to literature, pouring their hearts and souls into it, wasting their prime years on ineffective labor, filling boxes with manuscripts, and rarely having a single piece published or worth reading.

The muse of art is not infatuated with money, nor does she favor poverty. She only loves talent, passion, and inspiration.

### 贫困是否是创作成功的必要条件

　　贫困是否是创作成功的必要条件
    单正平在１９８９年第１期《天津文学》撰文说，“文章憎命达”，“诗穷而后工”，一直是几十年来文学史著作和文学理论教科书所强调的规律。文学家们几乎无人不相信这种观念。从历史看，贫穷固然哺育了一大批优秀作家，但出身贵族、身居高位、俸禄优厚而成为大师名家的也比比皆是。杜甫、曹雪芹固然穷极而后成大家，却也曾有过轻裘肥马金屋玉床的豪华奢侈生活。彻底的、从生到死一以贯之的赤贫生涯很难产生诗人。
    艺术创作需要起码的物质生存条件，人只有在解决了衣食住行的实际需求后才可能从事艺术和其他活动。艺术创作需要丰富的文化素养，而文化素养的获得要以丰厚的经济条件为代价。
    遗憾的是，一贯以贫穷为光荣的我们对这一现象视而不见，只是死盯着贾岛式的苦吟派和落了魄的吴敬梓、曹雪芹、蒲松龄，把贫穷加努力即是成功当作培养作家的不二法门。
    正是这一荒谬的信念，使许多有才华、有潜力的人将自己封闭在贫穷的境界中凝神修炼，期待幸运之神降临，反而越来越远地脱离了充满欲望的生活洪流。也正是这一谬见，使许多本无天赋、只以贫穷勤奋为资本的好青年盲目献身文学，呕心沥血，把大好年华虚掷在无法计量的无效劳动中，积稿盈箱，难得有一首半篇付梓问世、值得一读。
    艺术之神既不钟情于金钱，也不倾心于贫困，她只热爱天才、激情和灵感。
