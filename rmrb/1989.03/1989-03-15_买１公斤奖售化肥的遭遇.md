On January 8th, snowflakes were falling, and I went to the Wangzhuang grain store in my city to collect subsidized diesel and a 1-kilogram fertilizer coupon. I hurried to the oil depot. The gate was tightly shut, and more than 10 farmers, shivering from the cold, were waiting outside the depot. It was almost noon, but the depot's gate was still closed.

I couldn't buy the diesel, so I went to the fertilizer sales office. I encountered an old man carrying fertilizer. My heart leaped with joy, and I rushed into the room, took out my fertilizer coupon, and asked to buy fertilizer. A plump female clerk said, "Sold out!" I said, "There's clearly a big pile over there, how can you say it's sold out?" The clerk said, "That's high-priced fertilizer." I turned around and chased after the old man who had bought fertilizer, asking, "Is there any subsidized fertilizer left?" The old man said, "There is, but they just won't sell it. I had an argument with that clerk, and then I got a familiar person to intervene, and she finally sold it to me." Hearing the old man's words, I went back into the room and said, "Are you selling fertilizer based on personal connections or based on coupons?" "Sold out, there's no use talking about it!" the clerk retorted. I said a thousand kind words to her, but she remained unmoved. I have always been enthusiastic about delivering grain to the state, and why am I being treated this way when buying subsidized diesel and fertilizer? I had no choice but to go to the Wangzhuang grain store. The staff there said, "The fertilizer hasn't been sold out." They told me to find the leader of the township supply and marketing cooperative. The leader of the township supply and marketing cooperative told me, "You just go and say we agree to give it to you." I returned to the fertilizer sales office, but the clerk still refused to sell it. Later, the leader of the township supply and marketing cooperative sent someone with me to the clerk selling the fertilizer. The clerk told me to come back in three days. I said, "Buying 1 kilogram of fertilizer costs 5.8 yuan, can you make me run around for days?" With no choice, I had to find the leader of the township supply and marketing cooperative again. Finally, with the intervention of the leader of the township supply and marketing cooperative, the clerk sold me 1 kilogram of fertilizer.

For 1 kilogram of subsidized fertilizer, I ran around for a whole day, didn't even eat lunch, and covered more than 30 kilometers of unnecessary distance, exhausting all my words.

　　买１公斤奖售化肥的遭遇
    １月８日，雪花纷扬，我到我市王寨粮店领了奖售柴油和１公斤化肥票，急忙赶到油库。只见大门紧闭着，１０多个冻得发抖的农民守候在油库门口。快晌午了，油库的大门还没开。
    柴油买不成了，我又来到售化肥处。迎面碰上一个提着化肥的老汉，我心里一喜，三步并作两步走进屋里，掏出化肥票要买化肥。一个胖胖的女营业员说：“卖完了！”我说：“明明一大堆，你咋说卖完了？”营业员说：“那是高价化肥。”我转身追上那位买化肥的老汉问道：“奖售化肥还有没有？”老汉说：“有是有，可他们就是不卖，我和那位营业员吵一架，又搬来熟人，她才卖给我。”听了老汉的话，我返身进屋，说：“你卖化肥是看人情还是凭证？”“卖完了，再说也没用！”营业员没好气地说。我对她好话说了千千万，她还是无动于衷。我年年积极向国家交粮，购买奖售柴油和肥料为何受这般刁难。我只好找到王寨粮店，粮店同志说：“化肥没卖完。”他们让我找乡供销社领导人。乡供销社领导人对我说：“你只管去，就说我们同意给。”我回到卖化肥处，营业员还是不卖。后来，乡供销社领导人派人和我一起找到卖化肥的营业员，营业员让我３天后再来。我说：“买１公斤化肥５角８分钱，你能让我跑几天？”无奈，我只得再找乡供销社领导人。最后，在乡供销社领导人的干预下，营业员才将１公斤化肥卖给我。
    为了１公斤奖售化肥，我整整跑了１天，中午饭也没吃，跑了３０多公里冤枉路，费尽了口舌。
