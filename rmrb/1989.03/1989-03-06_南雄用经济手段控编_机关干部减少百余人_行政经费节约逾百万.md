Nanxiong Uses Economic Measures to Control Staffing
Reduces Number of Government Officials by Over a Hundred
Saves Over a Million in Administrative Expenses

GUANGZHOU, March 5 (Xinhua) — In Nanxiong County, Guangdong, officials have implemented a system where staffing quotas are linked to salaries and administrative expenses. By using economic measures to control staffing, the county has reduced the number of officials in party, government, and mass organizations by 168, maintaining a three-year period without exceeding the quota, and saving over 1.08 million yuan in administrative expenses.

The county, based on the principle of separating party and government functions, has separated units with enterprise and institutional characteristics from party and government organizations, redefining staffing and reducing positions and personnel. Through these efforts, the number of officials in county party, government, and mass organizations has been reduced from 875 to 707.

They have implemented a system where staffing quotas are linked to administrative expenses, rewarding reductions and penalizing excesses. After defining the quotas, the financial department issues salaries and administrative expenses according to the quotas, implementing a package deal.

　　南雄用经济手段控编
    机关干部减少百余人
    行政经费节约逾百万
    本报广州３月５日电  广东南雄县在实行干部编制与工资挂钩的基础上，继续实行干部编制与行政经费包干。由于用经济手段“控编”，县党政群机关干部减少１６８人，保持３年不超编，还节约行政经费１０８万元。
    这个县根据党政分开的原则，将属于企事业性质的单位从党政机关分出去，重新定编定员，减少职数和工作人员。经过努力，使县党政群机关干部从８７５人减少到７０７人。
    他们实行编制与行政经费挂钩，节编有奖，超编受罚。定编之后，由财政部门按编制发给工资和行政经费，实行包干。
