The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League is one of China's eight democratic parties, with over a thousand members, primarily consisting of middle and high-level intellectuals from Taiwan.

Reporter: Our economic reforms have encountered some mistakes. Is this related to insufficient ideological preparation?

Zheng Lizhi (from Taipei, Taiwan, 63 years old, came to the mainland in 1949. Currently the director of the International Economics Research Institute at Fudan University): Yes, it is. Recently, inflation reached double digits, and many people were outraged, unable to tolerate the reforms. This is a clear indication of insufficient ideological preparation. In fact, China's inflation is relatively mild compared to the rest of the world. Although the country is facing difficulties, the future remains optimistic. I noticed that the Premier's government work report did not use phrases like "the situation is excellent" or "very good," which is very realistic. Asking everyone to endure a few difficult years is acceptable, but if the problems persist for several years, it would be a disaster. The Communist Party, with over 60 years of experience and 47 million members, is capable of leading the country. However, it should avoid making too many mistakes.

Reporter: The decline in education is a hot topic at the "Two Sessions." Some people believe the core issue is insufficient educational funding. What is your opinion?

Chen Zhongyi (from Taipei, Taiwan, 64 years old, studied in the U.S. in 1951 and voluntarily came to the mainland after graduation, currently a professor at Tsinghua University's Department of Hydraulic Engineering): The government work report mentioned an increase of 5 billion yuan in educational funding this year. The national government has made significant efforts, and if this funding is genuinely allocated to educational causes, it would be excellent. However, I believe funding is not the fundamental issue. The central government should thoroughly investigate the causes of the decline in education. Education serving socialism is fine, but fundamentally, it is about improving the quality of the entire nation. Therefore, we should strengthen basic education and correct the current imbalance where higher education is prioritized over primary education.

Reporter: Democratic supervision is an important responsibility of the CPPCC. How do you think this aspect is being fulfilled?

Wu Ketao (from Yilan County, Taiwan, 64 years old, returned to the mainland in 1949, formerly the deputy general manager of the business department at the International Trust and Investment Corporation): I feel that the work of the CPPCC is not entirely normal. The NPC has clear legal bases, but the CPPCC does not. This makes it difficult to exercise democratic supervision. In the past, the CPPCC engaged more in discussions and less in governance; it emphasized long-term coexistence more than mutual supervision; it focused more on cooperation than opposition. The government and the United Front Work Department should create conditions for democratic parties to play a supervisory role. Some documents are only sent to the United Front Work Department, and we do not have the time to go there to review them. If it is truly democratic supervision, the democratic parties should be trusted.

Chen Zhongyi: The CPPCC report mentioned that 28% of proposals were adopted, but I think this proportion is too low. Is it due to the quality of the proposals, or other reasons? Especially regarding proposals for rectification, party discipline, and prices, which ones were adopted? There are no concrete examples, making it feel like a mere formality.

Reporter: The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League represents 3 million Taiwanese compatriots and their relatives on the mainland. Can it play a unique role in promoting reunification across the Taiwan Strait?

Xu Mengshan (from Yunlin County, Taiwan, came to Shanghai in 1946 to study, and after liberation, served as the secretary of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League headquarters, currently a member of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Central Advisory Committee): The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League has a better understanding of the situation in Taiwan. At the beginning of last year, the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League and the Taiwan Federation requested the establishment of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, which was established in September, greatly encouraging everyone. However, there have been some major decisions regarding Taiwan that were made without consulting the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. We hope that the formulation of major policies toward Taiwan will involve representatives from the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. Recently, the state stipulated that Taiwanese compatriots visiting relatives are given a $400 exchange quota, but without subsidies, which is unreasonable. Visiting relatives in Taiwan should be treated the same as visiting other parts of China, with travel expenses reimbursed or subsidized by the state. During this meeting, we have proposed a dialogue with the government officials responsible for Taiwan affairs to engage in political consultation and democratic supervision.

　　与台盟委员谈热门话题
    本报记者  何伟
    台湾民主自治同盟，中国８个民主党派之一，有盟员千余人，主要是台籍中高级知识分子。
    记者：我们的经济改革出现失误，这是否与思想准备不足有关？
    郑励志（台湾台北人，６３岁，１９４９年来大陆。现任复旦大学国际经济研究所所长）：是的。前一段出现通货膨胀，达到百分之十几，许多人哇哇叫，革命革到头上就受不了了，这正是思想准备不足的表现。其实，中国的通货膨胀就世界来讲是“小巫见大巫”。现在国家遇到困难，但前途还是乐观的。我注意到总理的政府工作报告，没有用“形势大好”、“很好”之类的词汇，很实际。要求大家过几年苦日子是可以的，如果过几年，问题还不能解决就糟了。共产党经过６０多年，有４７００多万党员，是能领导好的，只是不能失误太多。
    记者：教育滑坡是“两会”的热门话题，有人认为问题的焦点是教育经费不足，你怎么看？
    陈仲颐（台湾台北人，６４岁，１９５１年留学美国，毕业后志愿来大陆，现为清华大学水利系教授）：政府工作报告中提到今年增加教育经费５０亿，国家政府已尽了很大努力，如果这５０亿真正落在教育事业的实处，当然很好。不过，我认为经费不是根本因素。中央应该很好地摆开一个真正办教育的架式，仔细研究一下造成教育滑坡的原因。教育为社会主义服务是没有问题的，但根本上是为了提高全民族的素质。因此，应该加强基础教育，纠正目前教育头重脚轻的倾向。
    记者：民主监督是政协的重要职责，你认为这方面履行得怎样？
    吴克泰（台湾宜兰县人，６４岁，１９４９年回大陆，曾任国际信托投资公司业务部副总经理）：我觉得政协工作不大正常，人大有明确的法律依据，政协却没有。这就难以行使民主监督权。过去政协议政多，参政少；长期共存多，互相监督少；合作多，反对少。政府和统战部应为民主党派发挥监督作用创造条件。有些文件，只发到统战部，我们哪有时间跑去参阅呢？既然是民主监督，就应相信民主党派。
    陈仲颐：政协报告提到有２８％的提案被采纳，我认为比例太少，究竟是提案质量问题，还是什么其它原因？尤其是治理整顿、党风、物价等提案，哪些采纳，没有实际例子，使人感到是个花架子。
    记者：台盟是大陆３００万台胞和台属的代表，在促进海峡两岸统一方面是否可以发挥优势？
    徐萌山（台湾云林县人，１９４６年到上海读书，解放后任台盟总部秘书长，现任台盟中央评议委员）：台盟对台湾情况了解较多，去年初台盟台联要求成立国务院台湾事务办公室，９月就成立了，大家很受鼓舞。但也有一些对台重大决策，并没有与台盟协商就出台了。我们希望重大对台政策的制订应让台盟代表参加。前不久国家规定：台籍同胞探亲，每人给４００美元的兑换额，而没有补贴，很不合理。赴台湾探亲应像去中国其它地方一样，路费由国家报销或补贴。这次开会，我们已提出与政府对台工作负责人对话，为的是参政议政民主监督。
