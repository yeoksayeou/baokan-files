Strike Lasts Six Days, Losses Mount
Eastern Air Lines Files for Bankruptcy

	WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Due to the stalemate between labor and management, Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern Air Lines and its parent company Texas Air Corporation, announced today in New York that Eastern Air Lines has filed for bankruptcy protection.

	Lorenzo's decision came on the sixth day of a strike by Eastern Air Lines' ground staff. Since the strike began, the company has been losing over $4 million a day. Its cash reserves can only last for 45 days, and out of 33,000 employees, only 1,500 remain. The company is also facing pressure from creditors. Currently, Eastern Air Lines is trying to attract passengers with discounted tickets for flights between Washington, New York, and Boston, and is barely maintaining three weekly international flights to Latin America. All other flights, numbering in the thousands, have been suspended indefinitely.

	Lorenzo and Eastern Air Lines President Phil Bakes stated that the bankruptcy filing is to place the company under the protection of Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. This will allow the company to rehire employees and reorganize into a smaller, more cost-effective airline. They also plan to sell off some of the company's assets.

	Meanwhile, three unions representing Eastern Air Lines employees—the International Association of Machinists, the Air Line Pilots Association, and the Transport Workers Union—are trying to prevent the sale of the company's assets. They hope that, like Pan American World Airways, a favorable bidder will buy the entire company, benefiting the unions. Union members plan to present their own reorganization plan to the court as creditors and shareholders of the company.

	Lorenzo used a similar bankruptcy strategy six years ago to reorganize Continental Airlines, which he owned, into a low-cost, non-union company.

### 罢工六天　损失巨大  美东航宣告破产

　　罢工六天　损失巨大
    美东航宣告破产
    本报华盛顿三月九日电  记者仓立德报道：由于劳资双方互不妥协，美国东方航空公司及其母公司——得克萨斯航空公司董事长弗兰克·洛伦佐今天在纽约宣布，东方航空公司向联邦破产法庭提出破产。
    洛伦佐的破产决定是在东方航空公司地勤人员罢工进入第六天时作出的。罢工开始后，该公司每天损失达四百多万美元，储存的现金只够维持四十五天，三万三千名雇员只剩下一千五百名；同时还面临来自债权人的压力。目前该公司正在用低价票吸引顾客乘坐华盛顿—纽约—波士顿的区间航班，并勉强维持每周三班的拉美国际航班。其余上千次航班均告无限期停飞。
    洛伦佐及东方航空公司总裁菲尔·贝克斯表示，宣布破产是为了将该公司置于联邦破产法第十六章条款的保护下，以便重新招聘职工，另外组织一家业务缩小、成本降低的航空公司。他们还打算着手拍卖该公司的部分财产。
    与此同时，东方航空公司的三个工会——国际机械师协会、航空驾驶员协会和运输工人工会力图阻止拍卖财产的行动，希望像环球航空公司那样对工会有利的投标者将东方航空公司全部买下。工会会员将以公司债权人、持股人的资格向法庭提出自己的重组计划。
    洛伦佐六年前曾用破产办法，将他拥有的大陆航空公司重组成一家低成本、没有工会的公司。
