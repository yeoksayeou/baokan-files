The European Community and the Middle East

Israeli Prime Minister Shamir frequently visits the United States because Israel's relationship with the United States is extraordinary. However, since Shamir took office again last December, the first country he visited was France. Soon, Shamir will also visit Spain. It seems that Shamir has a special fondness for the European Community countries.

The European Community countries' favor with Shamir is not without reason. These countries have shown concern for the Middle East situation in recent times. The President of the European Commission, Delors, pointed out that "seeking to achieve something in the Middle East and proposing initiatives" is one of the three major goals of the European Community this year. The "trio" consisting of the former, current, and future presidents of the European Community recently visited countries such as Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. The French Foreign Minister specially visited Israel. The European Parliament has also been actively engaged in this matter. The meeting of European Community foreign ministers held in Madrid on February 14 decided to maintain contact with all parties, including the United States and the Soviet Union, to promote the early convening of an international conference. The European Community's active attitude towards Middle East affairs has been welcomed by Arab countries, which hope that the European Community countries will play a greater role in resolving the Middle East problem. However, the European Community's proposal to convene an international conference in the Middle East and to promote direct dialogue between Israel and the PLO is diametrically opposed to the views of the Israeli authorities. This has made Shamir restless, so he rushed to Europe to lobby, trying to win the sympathy of the European Community countries.

In fact, Europe's concern for the Middle East situation is not new. When the European Community proposed to "speak with one voice" in international affairs, it was first reflected in the Middle East issue. On one hand, this is because the two regions are geographically close, and the war and peace in the Middle East have a significant impact on Europe's stability and security; on the other hand, economic relations are close, with Europe's oil supply mainly relying on the Middle East, while Middle East countries import a large number of industrial products from Europe. Especially after the formation of the European single market in 1992, "the Middle East is one of the important targets for the European Community's external development." Therefore, promoting the Middle East peace process and easing the tension in this region is obviously in the immediate and long-term interests of the European Community countries.

Of course, the easing of the international situation, the shift of superpowers from confrontation to dialogue, and especially the significant adjustments in the policies of the PLO, have all provided opportunities for the European Community to conduct active diplomacy. European Community countries generally praise the PLO's contribution to breaking the Middle East peace talks stalemate and, in turn, demand that the Israeli authorities change their attitude. This is undoubtedly pressure on the Israeli authorities, which insist on a rigid stance.

In the past, Europe in international politics often had to follow the constraints of U.S. foreign policy, and in the Middle East issue, it was often required to synchronize with U.S. policy. But with the changes in the world situation, the shake-up of the bipolar world structure, and the gradual formation of a multipolar world, the European Community is also actively seeking to play a role in politics. It is not difficult to understand that in order to expand its influence in the Middle East and to have a say in promoting the Middle East peace process, the European Community needs to take a relatively balanced stance on the Arab-Israeli dispute, even distancing itself from the United States to some extent. President Mitterrand told the visiting Shamir, "The approach of leaving the Middle East issue entirely to the United States and the Soviet Union may bring more dangers to the long-term interests of Middle East countries, including Israel." It can be seen that the European Community hopes to play a role that is not insignificant in the Middle East political arena.

The European Community's exploration and efforts to promote the Middle East peace process are valuable, and its participation will give new impetus to the development of the Middle East situation.

### 欧共体与中东

　　欧共体与中东
    柯月霖
    以色列总理沙米尔经常访问美国，因为以色列与美国的关系不同寻常。然而，自从沙米尔去年十二月再次担任政府首脑以来，第一个访问的国家却是法国。不久，沙米尔还将访问西班牙。看来，沙米尔对欧共体国家似乎特别有股热乎劲。
    欧共体国家受到沙米尔的青睐并非没有缘由。因为这些国家近一个时期来都对中东局势表示关注。欧共体委员会主席德洛尔就指出，“争取在中东有所作为，提出倡议”是欧共体今年工作的三大目标之一。以欧共体前任、现任和下任主席组成的“三驾马车”最近访问了约旦、埃及和叙利亚等国。法国外长专程访问了以色列。欧洲议会也为此积极展开活动。二月十四日在马德里举行的欧共体外长会议已决定为促成国际和会早日召开而同包括美苏在内的各方保持接触。欧共体对中东事态的积极态度，受到了阿拉伯国家的欢迎，它们希望欧共体国家在解决中东问题中能发挥更大的作用。然而，欧共体要求召开中东国际和会和促使以色列与巴解组织直接对话的主张，与以色列当权者的看法大相径庭。这一来，沙米尔坐不住了，于是奔赴欧洲进行游说，试图争取欧共体国家对自己的同情。
    其实，欧洲关心中东局势非自今日始。当年欧共体提出在国际事务中“用一个声音说话”最早就体现在中东问题上。这一方面是因为两者地理相近，中东的战和对欧洲的稳定与安全影响极大；另一方面是经济关系密切，欧洲的石油供应主要依靠中东，而中东国家则从欧洲进口大量工业品。特别是一九九二年欧洲大市场形成后，“中东是欧共体向外发展的重要目标之一”。因此，推动中东和平进程，缓和这个地区的紧张局势，显然是符合欧共体国家当前和长远的利益的。
    当然，国际局势的日趋缓和，超级大国从对抗走向对话，特别是巴解组织政策的重大调整，都为欧共体开展积极外交提供了契机。欧共体国家普遍赞扬巴解组织为打破中东和谈僵局作出的贡献，进而要求以色列当局改变态度。这对坚持僵硬立场的以色列当局无疑是一种压力。
    过去，欧洲在国际政治中经常受到美国对外政策的制约，在中东问题上也往往被要求与美国政策同步。但随着世界形势的变化，两极世界格局的动摇，多极世界逐步形成，欧共体也积极谋求在政治上发挥作用。人们不难明白，为了在中东地区扩大自己的影响，以期在推动中东和平进程中有所作为，欧共体需要在阿、以争端问题上采取比较均衡的立场，甚至与美国拉开一定距离。密特朗总统对来访的沙米尔就这样说，“把中东问题完全交给美苏的办法，可能给中东国家，包括以色列的长远利益带来更多的危险。”可见，欧共体希望在中东政治舞台上扮演的并不是无足轻重的角色。
    欧共体为推动中东和平进程所作的探索和努力是有价值的，它的参与将会给中东局势的发展以新的推动。
