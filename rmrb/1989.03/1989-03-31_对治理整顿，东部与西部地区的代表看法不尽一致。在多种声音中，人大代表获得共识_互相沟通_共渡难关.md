    On the issue of economic adjustment, representatives from eastern and western regions hold differing views. Amidst the various opinions, the National People's Congress representatives have reached a consensus: mutual communication and overcoming difficulties together.

    This year's National People's Congress has left a strong impression of diverse voices.

    At the beginning of the meeting, representatives from western regions started expressing their views. "For coastal regions, the tightening policy is like cutting off the tail of a cow, but for our impoverished regions, it is like smashing the head of a cow with a brick," said a representative from Qinghai Province. This statement was immediately supported by representatives from Gansu and Inner Mongolia. A representative from Gansu said, "The raw materials produced by the western regions are mostly sold at low prices to the eastern regions for processing, allowing the eastern regions to gain excessive profits, while we, the poor provinces, are left guarding the 'money pot' (raw materials) and begging for food..."

    Representatives from eastern regions also could not remain silent. A representative from a province in southeastern China said, "Regarding the adherence to economic laws, one cannot say it is important when it is convenient and ignore it when it is not. Economic adjustment and rectification should also follow economic laws." He countered, "Have we not learned enough lessons from being punished by objective economic laws?"

    Each side has its own reasoning. A Western journalist even concluded that "China's economic tightening policy has caused dissatisfaction among local officials." In fact, as a sociologist pointed out, having different voices reflects the representatives' concern for the people's cause and their cherishing of their own powers. As for the conflicts between local interests and overall interests, many representatives have made pragmatic analyses and offered suggestions.

    A representative from Chongqing said, "We fully support the strategy of developing coastal regions. In the past few years, the inland regions have indeed benefited from the implementation of this strategy. For example, exporting and earning foreign exchange, introducing technology, etc. If we go back ten years, everyone would be treated equally, and no one would be able to develop, and the national economy would only be able to 'stand still'." An economist said, "Developing the coast and driving the inland is the inevitable path to national prosperity. As long as the coast can maintain equal exchange with the inland, the inland can take off economically; only with the support of the inland can the coastal regions develop sustainably." Yun Nan Province Governor He Zhiqiang suggested clearly, "Whether the focus of industrial layout should be on the coast or the west, I think it is better to discuss it according to the national industrial policy. For example, Yun Nan's phosphate ore, which is exported in large quantities every year, is not as cost-effective as focusing on local processing; while the rubber industry and coastal processing industry have already formed a pattern, occupying little transportation capacity, I support continuing to leverage coastal processing capabilities."

    Regions need communication and coordination, and so do industrial departments. A coal miner from Inner Mongolia reported to the reporter that farmers were mining coal and damaging resources, calling for the immediate ban on small coal mines. A farmer representative from Hebei also reported to the reporter, "The hardest hit are the farmers. Now, the dirty and heavy work that urban residents do not want to do is almost all taken over by farmers. In coal mines, workers are reluctant to go down the pits, and 70% of the frontline mining workforce are farmers." The reporter temporarily acted as a matchmaker for the two representatives, and the result of information communication was that both agreed: small coal mines, as one of the ways for farmers to get rich and reduce poverty, should still be allowed to develop, but while developing, management and guidance should be strengthened...

    Different voices can create a chaotic noise or form a magnificent chorus, and the key here is that everyone needs to communicate and have a sense of responsibility and urgency to overcome difficulties together. People's Congress representative and former chief engineer of Hangzhou Silk Industry Company, Kuang Yan, who has witnessed the frequent "silkworm cocoon wars" in recent years, said with deep feelings, "Economic work is like a string of grasshoppers on a rope, upstream and downstream products, inland and coastal regions, none can do without the other. If one only cares about oneself and the interests of one's own region, one can only be cutting one's own feet."

    "Communication and coordination are key," many representatives said, and they think so.

　　对治理整顿，东部与西部地区的代表看法不尽一致。在多种声音中，人大代表获得共识——        
    互相沟通　共渡难关
    本报记者  潘岗  莫新元
    今年的人大会议，给人突出的印象是多种声音。
    会议讨论伊始，西部地区的代表就放起“连珠炮”。“对于沿海地区来说，紧缩政策就像用刀割牛尾巴，而对我们贫困地区来说，就像用砖头砸牛的头。”青海省一位人大代表这样说。此话一出，即得到甘肃、内蒙古部分代表的响应。甘肃省一位代表说，西部生产的原材料绝大部分被低价调给东部地区加工，使东部地位加工业得以获得超额利润，而我们这些穷省，守着“钱罐子”（原材料）讨饭吃……
    东部地区的代表也“坐”不住。一位来自东南某省的代表说，对于按经济规律办事，不能认为重要时就讲，不重要时就不讲。治理、整顿也要按经济规律办事。他反问：“难道我们受客观经济规律惩罚的教训还少吗？”
    公说公有理，婆说婆有理。一位西方记者甚至得出这样的“印象”：中国经济紧缩政策“已引起地方官员的不满。”其实，正如一位社会学家所说，有不同声音，正反映了代表对人民事业的关心，对自己权力的珍惜。至于一些地方利益和整体利益之间的矛盾，许多代表都作了实事求是的分析和提出了建议。
    一位来自山城重庆的代表这样说，对发展沿海地区战略，我们是大力支持的。因为这几年间，内地也确实从这一战略的实施中得到了好处。比如出口创汇，引进技术等。如果倒退十年，大家什么都“一碗水端平”，谁也就别想发展，国家经济也只好“原地踏步走”。一位经济学专家说，发展沿海，带动内地，是图谋国家兴盛、繁荣的必由之路，只要沿海能坚持与内地“平等交换”，内地才能在经济上起飞；只有内地给沿海以支持，沿海地区发展才有不竭的源泉。云南省省长和志强则明确建议，工业布局重点，是放在沿海好，还是西部好，我认为还是根据国家产业政策区别论证为好。例如云南的磷矿石，每年大量外运加工就不如重点在本地加工合算；而橡胶工业、沿海加工业已成格局，所占运力不大，我就支持继续发挥沿海加工能力。
    地区之间需要沟通，需要协调，产业部门之间又何尝不是这样呢？内蒙古一煤矿工人向记者反映农民挖煤破坏资源，呼吁赶快查禁小煤窑。河北一农民代表也向记者反映，最苦的是农民，“现在城里人不愿干的脏活、重活，几乎都是农民‘包圆’，煤矿工人嫌累不愿下井，采掘第一线有７０％是农民”。记者临时当起这两位代表的“红娘”，信息沟通的结果是，两人一致认为：小煤窑作为农民致富、脱贫的途径之一，还得允许发展，但发展的同时，要加强管理、引导……
    有不同的声音，可以产生一个混乱的噪音，也可以组成雄浑的合唱，这里起关键作用的是大家要互相沟通，要有共渡难关的责任感和紧迫感。人大代表、原杭州市丝绸工业公司总工程师匡衍，亲眼目睹了近年频频发生的“蚕茧大战”造成的危害，他深有体会地说，经济工作就像一条绳上的蚂蚱，上游产品和下游产品、内地和沿海谁也离不开谁。如果只顾自己和本地区利益，只能是砍自己的脚。
    “重在沟通与协调。”许多代表这样说，也这样想。
