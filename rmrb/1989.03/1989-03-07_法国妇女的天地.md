With the improvement of the overall educational level of society, more and more French women are pursuing career success. They are no longer satisfied with gifts on Mother's Day or Grandmother's Day, nor are they content with the social etiquette of "ladies first." They are increasingly stepping into society to carve out their own new world.

Currently, French women make up 44% of the total workforce. The fields of fashion, finance, commerce, and secretarial work are their stages for showcasing their talents. Bernadette, the deputy representative of the Manhattan Bank, manages finances as skillfully as a man; Romilly, a professor of ancient Greek, has been elected as the second female academician in the 300-year history of the French Academy; Marion Vanier, a mother of three, has become the general manager of the French Amstrad Computer Company.

The enhanced ability of women to support themselves means that marriage is no longer the only guarantee of their livelihood. Therefore, family breakdowns and cohabitation without marriage are becoming more common. Currently, there are 6 million single women, and out of every 5 children, 1 lives in a single-parent household. Although parents generally believe that children are the best gift between men and women, women who are dedicated to their careers, just like those who enjoy food and entertainment, yearn for freedom and to be free from household chores. Therefore, they are generally unwilling to take on the "social duty" of childbearing. The total fertility rate of French women is 1.8, which is lower than the replacement-level fertility rate. The government has taken various measures to encourage childbearing, but the results have been limited. Some French women do not value the "family image" but pursue career success. They strive to open up new horizons with their own value rather than their gender.

　　法国妇女的天地
    魏玉琴
    随着全社会教育水平的提高，法国越来越多的妇女在追求事业的成功，她们不再满足于母亲节、祖母节时的礼物，更不满足于“女士优先”的社交礼仪，她们越来越多地走上社会，去闯出自己的新天地。
    目前，法国就业妇女占就业人口总数的４４％，服装、金融、商业及秘书等行业是她们施展才华的舞台：曼哈顿银行副代表伯纳德特女士，理财像理家一样比男人干得好；古希腊语女学者罗米利教授已当选法兰西学院成立３００年来的第二位女院士；３个孩子的妈妈玛丽昂·瓦尼埃当上了法国阿姆斯塔德计算机公司的总经理。
    妇女谋生能力的增强使得婚姻不再是她们赖以生活的唯一保障，所以，家庭解体和未婚同居现象日益增多。目前单身妇女已达６００万，５名儿童中就有一名是生活在单亲家庭之中。尽管父母们普遍认为孩子是男女之间互相赠送的最好礼物，但一心扑在事业上的女性和热衷于美食、娱乐的女性一样，渴望自由和摆脱家务，因此，一般不愿意多尽生养子女这一“社会义务”。法国妇女总和生育率１．８个，低于人口更替水平生育率。政府为鼓励生育采取了多项措施，但收效不大。法国一些妇女不看重“家庭形象”，而追求事业的成功。她们努力以自身的价值而不是以性别，去开辟新天地。
