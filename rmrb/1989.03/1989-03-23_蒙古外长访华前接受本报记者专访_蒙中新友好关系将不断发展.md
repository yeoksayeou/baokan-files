Mongolian Foreign Minister Gombosuren Accepts Interview with Our Reporter Before Visiting China

	Mongolian-Chinese Friendship Will Continue to Develop
	Our reporter Danlin reports from Ulaanbaatar: Mongolian Foreign Minister Gombosuren accepted an interview with our reporter on the afternoon of March 18, emphasizing that in recent years, due to the efforts of both sides, the process of normalizing Mongolian-Chinese relations has made significant progress. Active steps are being taken to restore relations between the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and the Communist Party of China; cultural, scientific, and technological cooperation and trade exchanges between the two countries are expanding; the two countries have signed consular treaties, border regulations, and treaties for handling border issues, and the two countries have also conducted their first joint inspection of the border.

	In reviewing the 40-year history of Mongolian-Chinese relations, Gombosuren pointed out that there have been periods of active development and periods of relative stagnation. Currently, the task at hand is to further normalize the relationship between the two socialist neighboring countries and develop cooperation in all areas. He believes that under the guidance of the spirit of the 1960 Mongolian-Chinese Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty, the new friendly relations between the two countries will continue to develop.

	At the invitation of the Chinese Foreign Minister, Gombosuren will visit Beijing at the end of this month. This will be the first official visit by a Mongolian Foreign Minister to China. He expressed that during the visit, he will reaffirm the Mongolian government's firm stance on actively developing friendly relations with China based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, and exchange views with the Chinese Foreign Minister on strengthening mutual trust and developing cooperation in various fields. He said that both sides have agreed to discuss issues such as the establishment of an intergovernmental economic, trade, and technological committee during the visit. In addition, Gombosuren also expressed that briefly understanding the excellent historical and cultural traditions of the Chinese people and their current reform efforts is also an important part of his visit to China.

	When discussing the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, Gombosuren pointed out that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations not only serves the interests of the peoples of both countries but also has significant implications for consolidating peace and security in Asia and the world. He also pointed out that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is particularly important for Mongolia, which is located between the two great powers. From this perspective, he wishes the upcoming high-level Sino-Soviet meeting success.

	Finally, in response to the question about the Mongolian Party's Nineteenth Central Committee's Fifth Plenary Session on the issue of integrating the development of foreign relations with domestic development tasks, Gombosuren pointed out that under the guidance of the thought of the Fifth Plenary Session, the Mongolian government, while ensuring participation in the international socialist division of labor, has begun to implement a policy of reasonably participating in the world economy, particularly in the economic ties of the Asian region.

　　蒙古外长访华前接受本报记者专访        
    蒙中新友好关系将不断发展
    本报乌兰巴托电  记者丹林报道：蒙古外长贡布苏伦３月１８日下午接受本报记者专访时着重指出：近几年来，由于双方的努力蒙中关系正常化的进程出现了明显的进展。为恢复蒙古人民革命党和中国共产党的关系正在采取积极步骤；两国间的文化、科技合作与贸易往来正在扩大；两国间已签订了领事条约、边界制度和处理边境问题的条约，两国还对边界进行了首次联合检查。
    在回顾蒙中关系近４０年的历程时，贡布苏伦指出，两国关系有过积极发展的时期，也有过相对停滞的时期。当前，使两个社会主义邻国间的关系进一步完全正常化，发展各方面的合作是我们的共同任务。他相信，在１９６０年蒙中友好互助条约的精神指导下，两国间新的友好关系将会不断发展。
    应中国外交部长的邀请，贡布苏伦外长将于本月末访问北京。这将是蒙古外长对中国的首次正式访问。他表示将在访问中重申蒙古政府在和平共处原则基础上积极发展同中国友好关系的坚定立场，并就加强两国间的信任和发展各个领域的合作与中国外长交换意见。他说，双方已商定，访问期间将就建立两国政府间经贸科技委员会等问题进行讨论。此外，贡布苏伦还表示，简要地了解中国人民历史、文化的优良传统以及当前的改革事业也是他访问中国的重要内容之一。
    在谈到中苏关系正常化问题时，贡布苏伦指出：中苏关系正常化不仅符合两国人民的利益，且对巩固亚洲和世界和平与安全有着重大意义。他还指出，中苏关系正常化对地处中苏两大国之间的蒙古来说，尤为重要。从这一点出发，他祝愿不久将举行的中苏高级会晤取得成功。
    最后，在回答有关蒙党十九届五中全会关于发展对外关系要与国内发展任务相结合问题时，贡布苏伦指出，在五中全会这一思想的指导下，蒙古政府在确保参与国际社会主义分工的同时，开始实行合理地参加世界经济、尤其是亚洲地区经济联系的方针。
