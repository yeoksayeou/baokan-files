The resolution passed by the meeting emphasized that the China Democratic National Construction Association, as a party participating in the multi-party cooperation led by the Communist Party of China, should, in this crucial period of construction and reform, exhibit a spirit of shared destiny and shoulder the responsibilities it should bear. It requires that all levels of the China Democratic National Construction Association and all party members correctly understand the current situation, focus on the central task of rectification and deepening reform, actively offer suggestions and think of ways to promote clean governance, and further play a role in political participation and supervision. At the same time, it is necessary to adapt to the development and changes in the situation across the Taiwan Strait, strengthen contacts with relevant circles in Taiwan, promote the "three links" and two-way exchanges across the strait, and continue to work for the promotion of national reunification. The meeting called on all party members to boost their spirits, strengthen their confidence, resolutely safeguard the political situation of stability and unity, and work hard on various tasks to strive for the victory of rectification and deepening reform.

This meeting also reviewed and passed the "1989 Work Points of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association," the "Decision of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association on the Establishment of a Complaint Center," and other proposals.
