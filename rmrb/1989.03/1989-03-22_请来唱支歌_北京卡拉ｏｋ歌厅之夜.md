Beijing's nights are quiet and uneventful. The few dance halls available offer the same old routines: ballroom dancing and disco. When I heard that a karaoke bar had opened in the Geological Hall on Beijing's Xisi Street, I was immediately intrigued.

"Karaoke is a form of entertainment that has been popular in Japan and other countries in recent years. Guests can sing freely with tape accompaniment. Tonight, I will be your host, and we'll start with a lively tune from our band." The host, Su Lijun, was poised and confident. He is a bus driver for Route 12, but in his spare time, he often goes to bars and karaoke bars to sing. He was invited to host here by the manager. Unlike the other patrons, he doesn't sing for his own enjoyment but to make a name for himself one day.

As he spoke, a note was passed to him. He immediately approached the audience: "Next, Mr. Liu from Table 13 would like to sing a song."

A young man who looked like a college student stepped onto the stage. As the music for "Stars of Last Night" played, he began to move his body. Perhaps due to nervousness, he couldn't sing well. Little Su comforted him, "Don't worry, let's sing together."

Two more young men took the stage one after the other. From their performances, they seemed to be regulars at the karaoke bar, performing naturally with pleasant voices. One was Wang Wei, who works at the Gas Company. He said he has always loved singing and comes here to satisfy that desire. Perhaps because he practices here often, he has recently participated in several singing competitions with good results. The other was a vocational high school student, Ren Hongjian. When asked why he came to sing, he replied, "For fun!"

Occasionally, real actors also appear here. I saw two familiar faces from the movie "Two Sons Open a Shop." The actor who played "Big Tiger," Cui Bin, is from the China Peking Opera Troupe. He sang a song but was recognized halfway through and had to switch to a Peking opera piece. "Bamboo Pole" Liang Tian, with his slender body, sang and performed various humorous actions, making the entire audience laugh.

The duty manager, Cong Zheming, introduced that the karaoke bar has been open for over a month. Initially, it was just karaoke, but they found that customers had difficulty adapting to this format, often leading to lulls. So, they invited a band and several amateur or professional singers to combine self-entertainment with appreciation, renaming it the Karaoke Bar.

This place can accommodate about 50 people each day, sometimes even more. The patrons include students, workers, managers, clerks, and individual business owners. Some come to chat about love, others to discuss business, some to socialize, and others to satisfy their singing desires or simply to pass the time. Several individual business owners from Liulichang are regulars here. Feng Zhitong owns an antique shop called "Zhitong Pavilion." He said the evenings are too boring, so he comes here for some entertainment.

In cities like Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Kunming, nightlife is rich and varied, with some activities lasting all night. Karaoke is very popular, and there are always singers. Beijing, however, is more monotonous, and the karaoke situation is not ideal. Most people only listen to songs and rarely sing themselves. Therefore, karaoke in Beijing is somewhat ahead of its time and carries some risks. But the general manager of the Geological Hall, Jiang Yixin, believes that someone has to dare to be ahead in any endeavor; otherwise, it's hard to develop, and entertainment is no exception. He also has an insight: those who come to the karaoke bar are mostly ordinary people who don't stand out in society, but here they can fully express themselves, and there are people to applaud and encourage them, showing their value and boosting their confidence.

### 请来唱支歌——北京卡拉ＯＫ歌厅之夜

　　请来唱支歌        
    ——北京卡拉ＯＫ歌厅之夜
    陈原
    北京的夜晚很冷寂，有限的一些舞厅都是老一套：交际舞、迪斯科。当得知位于北京西四的地质礼堂开了家卡拉ＯＫ歌厅，立刻引起我的兴趣。
    “卡拉ＯＫ是近些年流行于日本等国的娱乐形式，来客可自由演唱，有磁带伴奏。今晚由我主持，先请乐队奏一支欢快的曲子。”主持人苏立军落落大方。他是１２路公共汽车的司机，近几年工作之余常去酒吧、歌厅唱歌，来这里主持是应经理聘请。他和在座的那些顾客不同，不为自娱，而是为了有朝一日能唱出个名堂来。
    说话间，一张纸条递过来。他立即走向观众：“下面，１３号桌的刘先生想唱首歌。”
    一位大学生模样的青年走上台来。《昨夜星辰》的曲子一放，他就开始舞动身子。或许由于紧张，怎么也唱不好。小苏安慰说：“别慌，我们一起唱。”
    接着，又有两位男青年相继登台。从他们的演唱看，似乎是歌厅常客，表演自然，歌喉也动听。一叫王巍，在煤气公司工作。他说从小就喜欢唱歌，到这里来是想满足这种欲望。可能因为常在这里，有机会锻炼，他最近还参加了几次唱歌比赛，成绩不错。另一位是职业高中学生任鸿健。问他什么来唱歌，答“好玩呗！”
    这里不时也有真正的演员出现。我见到电影《二子开店》中的两张面孔。演“大虎”的崔斌是中国评剧院演员，一首歌没唱完就让大家认出来了，只得回到老本行，唱段评戏。“麻杆”梁天晃着精瘦的身体，边唱边做各种滑稽动作，令全场捧腹。
    值班经理丛者明介绍，这个卡拉ＯＫ歌厅已开办一月有余。开始时只是卡拉ＯＫ，后来发现客人们对这种形式一时还难适应，常常冷场，便请来乐队和几位业余歌手甚至专业歌手，把自娱和欣赏结合起来，更名为卡拉ＯＫ歌厅。
    此处每天能接待５０人左右，有时还爆满。来客中有大中学生、工人、经理、职员、个体户。谈情说爱的，聊生意的，交际的，满足歌唱欲望的，还有纯粹消磨时间的。琉璃厂的几家个体户是这里的常客。冯志忠开了家“志忠阁”古玩店，他说晚上太枯燥，来这里娱乐娱乐。
    在上海、广州、昆明等地，夜间娱乐活动丰富多采，有的通宵达旦，卡拉ＯＫ极爱欢迎，歌者不绝。北京就比较单调，卡拉ＯＫ的情况也不理想，多数人只听歌，难得张口。因而，卡拉ＯＫ在北京有些超前，需要承担一些风险。但地质礼堂总经理姜一新认为，干什么事都要有人敢于超前，否则就难以发展，娱乐也是如此。他还有一番见解：来卡拉ＯＫ歌厅的人多是普通百姓，在社会上不惹人注目，但在这里就可以尽情表现，还有人鼓掌助兴，体现了自己的价值，增强了自信心。
