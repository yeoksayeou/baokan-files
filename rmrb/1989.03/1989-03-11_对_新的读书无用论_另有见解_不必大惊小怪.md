Title: Another Perspective on the "New Theory of Reading Being Useless" — No Need to Be Alarmed

	The "new theory of reading being useless" is on the rise. I believe this is a normal phenomenon in the process of social development, and there is no need to be overly concerned.

	It is widely accepted that the current level of productivity in our country is quite low. In some places, the issue of basic sustenance has just been addressed, while in others, it is still a work in progress. A person who is starving will be focused on obtaining a piece of bread rather than considering matters like the ceasefire between Iraq and Iran. In other words, if a person's immediate interests are not met, asking them to have a broad vision is like trying to catch a fish by climbing a tree. One important reason for dropping out of school to engage in business is that people's material needs are far from being satisfied, and thus their spiritual needs are neglected.

	Reform has introduced a competitive mechanism, and the principle of "survival of the fittest" is gradually entering various aspects of social life. "Natural selection" forces everyone who wants to survive to leverage their strengths and avoid their weaknesses. Some people are good at business, and with a shout, money comes in; others excel in reading, and they can memorize what they read. If you make the former read books, their minds may not open up; similarly, if you make the latter switch to shouting, a single "woe—" might scare away the customers. The world is diverse, and everyone has their own strengths and aspirations. Fully showcasing each person's unique qualities will make life vibrant and colorful. Why should everyone be forced to read books? If one can live well without reading, why should they read?

	It is said that Beijing's university campuses are divided into two types of students: "Tao Pai" (those who take the TOEFL to go abroad) and "Ma Pai" (those who play mahjong and enjoy leisure). In this regard, we can also divide them into two groups: the "Academic Group" and the "Business Group." In fact, today's students and parents are not all swept up in the trend of dropping out to do business; there are many who value learning and encourage their children to strive for progress.

	"When people have enough food and clothing, they know shame and honor." The "new theory of reading being useless" is just a temporary phenomenon in the process of reform. As the level of productivity improves, once people's material needs are met to a certain extent, they will naturally have spiritual needs. Today, the fact that young people in Guangzhou hang "university diplomas" on their stalls is a clear example.

	The "new theory of reading being useless" is fundamentally different from the previous "theory of reading being useless": in the past, if you wanted to read, you couldn't; today, if you want to read, you are encouraged to read, and if you don't read, you are advised to read. This point must be distinguished.

### 对“新的读书无用论”另有见解——不必大惊小怪

专栏：我看“新的读书无用论”

　　对“新的读书无用论”另有见解——
    不必大惊小怪
    北京房山桥梁厂  白承杰
    新的“读书无用论”抬头，我认为是社会发展中的正常现象，不必大惊小怪。
    世所公认，目前，我国的生产力水平相当低，有的地方刚刚解决温饱问题，有的地方还处于“正在进行时”。一个忍饥挨饿的人，他一个心眼想的就是怎样得到一片面包，而决非去考虑什么两伊停火之类。这就是说，如果一个人的眼前利益还顾不过来，你让他高瞻远瞩，岂不缘木求鱼？弃学经商的一个重要原因，就是人们的物质需求远未满足，当然精神需求要受委屈了。
    改革引入竞争机制，优胜劣汰逐渐进入社会生活的各个领域，“物竞天择”迫使每个要生存下去的人必须扬长避短。有的人善于经商，吆喝一声钱就能来；有的人长于读书，过目成诵。假如让前者去读书，他的脑袋不一定能开窍；同样，让后者“改行”去吆喝，一声“苦哇——”，不把顾客吓跑了才怪呢。世界本来千姿百态，人各有所长、人各有志，充分展示每个人的特色，生活才会充满七色阳光。为什么要“一刀切”地让每个人都去读书呢？眼下，如果不读书生活得并不错，他为什么要去读书呢？
    据说，北京的大学校园分为“托派”（考托福出国）和“麻派”（搓麻将逍遥）两类学生。我看，在这个问题上，也可以类似分为两派——“学派”和“商派”。其实，当今的学生和家长并非都被刮进辍学经商风里，重视学习、督促孩子上进的大有人在。
    “衣食足，知荣辱”。“新的读书无用论”只是改革进程中出现的暂时现象，随着生产力水平的提高，人们对物质的需求达到一定程度后，自然会有精神上的需求。当今，广州青年把“大学文凭”挂到货摊上，即见一斑。
    “新的读书无用论”与曾有过的“读书无用论”有着根本性的区别：过去，你想读书，读也读不成；今天，你想读鼓励你读，不读劝你读。这一点要分清。
