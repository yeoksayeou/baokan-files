As the world is about to enter the 1990s, some countries have already begun planning their long-term strategies for the 21st century. The newly elected Bush administration in the United States is also conducting intensive research on this issue. On March 16, President Bush outlined the basic strategic vision that the United States will adopt in the 1990s and beyond in a speech in Houston.

Bush emphasized in his speech that the United States needs to formulate a long-term agenda to address the challenges it will face in the 21st century, both domestically and internationally. He asked, "What preparations will we make for the new world that begins in 11 years?" He believes that these preparations should include: investing in the economy and education; protecting the environment and avoiding short-sighted actions that may cause long-term damage; and viewing global changes from a long-term perspective to determine America's foreign policy and measures. To achieve this, the United States must stimulate investment in the economy, strengthen research and development programs, and increase funding for scientific research; reduce capital gains taxes to create a favorable environment for economic growth, competition, and effective investment; prioritize environmental protection; encourage and improve the quality of education; and formulate a "strategy to ensure freedom" for national security, paying attention to every changing factor on the international stage. However, Bush also acknowledged that achieving these goals "is not something that can be done in a day." The blueprint for America's next century that Bush has outlined may or may not be fully realized, but the actions of the United States will undoubtedly attract widespread attention.

　　布什谈美国２１世纪战略
    本报讯  在世界即将跨入９０年代之际，一些国家已在规划２１世纪的长期战略。美国新上台的布什政府，也在就此问题加紧进行研究。布什总统３月１６日在休斯敦的一次讲话简要概述了美国在９０年代以至２１世纪将采取的基本战略构想。
    布什在讲话中强调，美国需要制订一项长远的议事日程，以对付２１世纪国内外面临的挑战。他说，当前一个至关重要的问题是：“我们将为１１年之后开始的新世界做哪些准备工作？”他认为，准备工作包括：在经济和教育方面投资；保护环境、避免采取会造成长期损害的目光短浅的行动；从长远的眼光来看待世界格局的变化，以确定美国的对外政策及措施。为此，美国必须刺激经济方面的投资、加强研究与开发计划、增加科研经费；降低资本收益税，以创造一种有利于经济增长、促进竞争和富有成效的投资气候；把保护环境列为最优先考虑的问题；必须鼓励和提高教育质量；必须制订一项“确保自由”的国家安全战略，并重视国际舞台上出现的每一个变化因素。但是，布什也承认，要做到这些“并非一日之功”。而布什总统所描绘的美国下世纪的蓝图能在多大程度上得以实现，恐怕谁都难以预料。但是，美国的举动无疑将受到人们的普遍关注。
