On January 27, two farmers from Hubei's Zao Yang County brought a batch of coffins to our township to sell. Within less than a day, all the coffins were sold out. Currently, in Wu Gou Village of our township, 115 out of the 147 elderly people over the age of 50 have their own coffins. Some young people in rural areas believe that preparing a coffin for the elderly is a way of showing filial piety. However, relevant departments do not pay enough attention to funeral reform work. The trend of buying coffins for the living elderly in our area will only become more prevalent.

　　抢购棺材影响殡改
    １月２７日，湖北枣阳县两个农民将一批棺材拉到我乡销售。不到一天时间，这批棺材便被抢购一空。现在，我乡吴沟村的１４７名５０岁以上的老人中，１１５人有了棺材。一些农村青年认为，给老人准备一口棺材，是对老人尽了孝心。有关部门对殡葬改革工作不重视，我们这里给活着的老人买棺材的风将越刮越盛。
