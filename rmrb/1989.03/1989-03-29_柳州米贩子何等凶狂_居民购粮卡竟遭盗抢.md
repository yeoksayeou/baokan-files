Since last October, some lawless elements in our city have been buying up grain everywhere and reselling it. According to incomplete statistics from the city's grain department, 43 grain stores in the city area have nearly 20,000 kilograms of grain bought up by grain speculators daily. Some of these speculators sell the grain at a higher price locally or transport it to other places for high-profit resale.

Additionally, some grain speculators have even stolen or openly snatched residents' grain coupons, altered them, and used them to buy grain at stores. In early December last year, the city's grain department seized 7 altered grain coupons and a privately made official seal from a grain speculator's home. In the past three months, over 500 households in the city have reported the loss of their grain coupons, many of which were stolen or snatched by grain speculators while residents were queuing to buy grain.

Recently, the city's grain, public security, and industrial and commercial departments conducted a joint operation, seizing 125,000 kilograms of grain bought up by speculators and penalizing 447 speculators. However, this problem has not been fundamentally resolved.

　　柳州米贩子何等凶狂        
    居民购粮卡竟遭盗抢
    去年１０月以来，我市一些不法分子到处套购粮食，进行倒卖。据市粮食部门不完全统计：市区４３个粮店一天有近２万公斤粮食被米贩子套购。一些米贩子将套购来的粮食，或就地加价销售，或运往外地高价倒卖。
    另外，有的米贩子竟偷盗和公开抢夺居民的购粮卡，涂改后到粮店买粮食。去年１２月初，市粮食部门从一个米贩子家中查获７本被涂改过的购粮卡和一枚私刻的公章。近３个月来，全市有５００多户居民申报购粮卡丢失，其中不少是在排队购粮时，被米贩子盗走或抢走的。
    前不久，我市粮食、公安、工商部门联合行动，共查获被米贩子套购的粮食１２．５万公斤，处罚米贩子４４７人次。然而，这一问题还没有从根本上得到解决。
