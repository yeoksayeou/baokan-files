A sculptor taking up oil painting is nothing new in the world of art, where there seems to be no end to the variety of artistic experiments. However, Chen Huan, a sculptor recognized by the art world for his success, has completely switched to a new medium and language, focusing on the human body as his subject. This cannot help but draw the attention of both the sculpture and painting communities. Historically, the transition from three-dimensional sculptural forms to two-dimensional canvas painting has been fraught with difficulty, and many view it as a daunting challenge.

The exhibition features 37 oil paintings, all depicting female figures, with most of the compositions filled with realistic human forms. This type of composition has been classic in traditional art, but Chen Huan manages to present a fresh and surprising visual experience. This is mainly due to the fusion of stylized human art with modern cultural dilemmas, resulting in a subtle and lyrical visual image.

Chen Huan has been influenced by Western traditions of human body art, and his oil paintings reflect a deep resonance with these traditions. The female figures in his works, in their gestures and expressions, consciously or unconsciously follow the principles of classical masters. In paintings like "Morning Light" and "Confusion," the reclining figures evoke the grace and elegance of Greek reliefs. In "Fading Dream," one can see the soft beauty of Michelangelo's female sculptures. Chen Huan's mastery of realistic techniques, combined with his absorption of traditional human body representation models, gives his paintings a perfect form that easily resonates with aesthetic sensibilities.

However, Chen Huan's paintings cannot return to the rationality and harmony of traditional human body art. The contradictions and disorder of reality make his human figures depart from pure idealism. The expressions of the figures in his paintings are more languid and restless compared to those of previous eras. The human forms and the artist's intentions both contain a sense of human struggle and deep reflection, making the pursuit of ideals seem more subtle and restrained, conveying a heavy modern cultural atmosphere.

The modern elements in these paintings are also evident in Chen Huan's evolution from three-dimensional sculptural techniques to two-dimensional compositions of form and color. In "Interval," the female figure is abstracted into a thin "silhouette," floating ambiguously in a space composed of multiple planes, with symbolic and dreamlike qualities. As time progresses, he increasingly emphasizes the expressive nature of form, weakening the detailed expressions of the human body, and replacing them with rhythmic colors and the organization of lines and shapes. Because the classical models of human body art are embedded in the paintings as a quality, the lyrical nature remains as a persistent undertone. Therefore, seemingly disorderly techniques often become the "deliberate roughness" and harmonious variations within the complete composition.

Compared to various conceptual arts that focus on deconstruction and criticism, and to the rough, primitive arts that draw on ancient and ethnic aesthetics, Chen Huan's oil paintings are nostalgic, a retrospective of the glorious classical spirit with the attitude of "knowing it is impossible yet striving for it." What is particularly interesting is that, at present, avant-garde artistic languages and national aesthetic sentiments struggle to harmonize perfectly, leading to a new trend in improving the basic weaknesses of artistic expression. In this context, Chen Huan's stylistic paintings have found fertile ground in an increasingly academic art environment.

Since Chen Huan's paintings stand at the intersection of perfection and disorder, tradition and modernity, maintaining a delicate balance of conflicting emotions, the artistic language itself holds great potential for transformation and variation. How to strengthen adaptability and foresight within the expressive language will be the future challenge for Chen Huan.

　　艺术风格的新尝试
    ——观《陈皖山人体油画展》
    王勇
    雕塑家弄起油画来了，这在几乎无奇不有、令人眼乱的种种艺术尝试中，算不得新奇。但陈皖山作为美术界认可的成功雕塑家，现在完全更换工具和语言，且以人体为表现对象，就不能不让雕塑圈和画界的人审慎视之。历史上雕塑家由三维的体积、空间塑造转为平面画布上的二维刻画，由于几无大成而被很多人视为畏途。
    展厅里３７张油画，清一色的女人体，大都以具象人体充盈整个画面。这种构图在传统中有过多的经典性创造，已成为一种危险的稳态格局。而陈皖山却借以表现出了令行家、观众诧异的新颖画境。这主要是因人体艺术的风格化程式与现代文化困扰的交织，在他的创作中形成了一种蕴藉、抒情的视觉图像。
    陈皖山曾受教其中的西方人体艺术传统，在这些油画中流露出了浓厚的回光余韵。女人体举手投足，一顾一颦，都有意无意追寻着古典大师的造型法则。从《晨光》、《惑》等画中的倚躺人体，可以感到某些希腊浮雕的曼妙多姿；在《残梦》中，又能见到米开朗基罗女像塑造的柔美情采。陈皖山以熟练的写实技巧为基础，对艺术史中积累的人体表现模式的吸取和趋近，使他的画取得一种极易契合审美心理的完美形致。
    但陈皖山的画已不可能回复传统人体艺术的理性与和谐。现实感受的矛盾和无序使他的人体不得不脱离单纯的理想主义。画中形体的表情较之前代更显慵倦和不安。人体情态和作者的创作意向，都隐含一种人性受阻的困厄和深吟，使得理想的追寻变得委婉回还，传达出凝重的现代文化气息。
    这些画中的现代意味还表现在，经一年多探索，陈皖山的绘画语言已从最初的立体形塑，发展到平面上的形块、色彩构成。《间隔》把女人体抽象化为细薄的“剪影”，飘浮游移在多个平面构成的不确定的空间中，具有隐喻的象征性和梦幻感。越到后来，他越加强了形的写意性，弱化了人体细节的表情能力，代之以色彩节奏，线、形秩序的组织。由于人体艺术的经典程式已作为一种气质敷设在画面内部，抒情性始终作为顽强的底色，所以，似是无序的技巧表现常常恰到好处地成为完整画意中“精心的粗率”及和谐的变奏。
    比起种种以解析批判为能事的观念艺术，和以先民边地原始性为参照的粗犷艺术，陈皖山的油画是怀旧的，是对辉煌的古典精神“知其不可为而为之”的回顾。尤其令人感兴趣的是，目前前卫艺术语言和民族审美情愫一时难以完美通融，艺术运动产生了一种改善艺术表现力基本薄弱点的新趋向，在这种局势下，陈皖山的风格主义绘画在学术性日渐增强的艺术环境中找到了土壤。
    由于陈皖山的绘画处于完美与无序、传统与现代的某种临界面上，以两难的情感维系着风格的微妙；那么，这种艺术语言本身就潜伏了转化变异的极大可能。在表现语言中如何加强应变力和预见性，将是未来对陈皖山的考验。
