The Qinling Gold Mine in Lingbao County, Henan Province, is one of the major gold-producing areas in China. In recent years, more than 50 collective units and individual operators have been illegally mining gold, causing severe damage to the mineral resources. According to incomplete statistics, since 1986, the Si Fang Gou Mine alone has lost 3,201 kilograms of gold.

Facing this situation, the Qinling Gold Mine has repeatedly reported to the relevant higher authorities, requesting them to urge the collective units and individuals mining gold in the Si Fang Gou mining area and other places to withdraw completely by January 1, 1988. However, these collective units and individuals have continued to mine gold, making it impossible for the Qinling Gold Mine to carry out its basic construction work normally. The 8 million yuan of construction funds planned for 1988 could not be completed on schedule, and the planned production of 5,000 taels of gold in the Si Fang Gou Mine has completely failed.

The mine director of the Qinling Gold Mine appeals to the leaders at all levels of Henan Province, Sanmenxia City, and Lingbao County to take immediate measures to help solve this problem.

　　秦岭金矿满目疮痍
    河南灵宝县秦岭金矿是我国黄金重要产地之一。近几年来，当地５０多个集体单位和个体户乱挖滥采金矿，致使矿产资源遭到严重破坏。据不完全统计，自１９８６年以来，仅四范沟矿就损失黄金达３２０１公斤。
    面对这一情况，秦岭金矿曾多次向上级有关部门反映，要求他们敦促在四范沟矿区等地开采金矿的集体单位和个人，在１９８８年１月１日前全部撤离。但是，这些集体单位和个人竟我行我素，继续采挖金矿，使秦岭金矿的基本建设工作不能正常进行，１９８８年计划安排的８００万元的基建无法如期完成，四范沟矿５０００两黄金产量计划已经全部落空。
    秦岭金矿矿长呼吁河南省、三门峡市和灵宝县各级领导同志尽快采取措施，帮助他们解决这一问题。
