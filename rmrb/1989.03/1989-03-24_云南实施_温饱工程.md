Yunnan is implementing the "Food Security Program." Recently, the province has arranged for the planting of 100,000 acres of hybrid corn covered with plastic film. Agricultural supplies and funding for related services are gradually being put in place. Among the 125 agricultural counties (cities) in the province, 41 are impoverished counties. Experiments have shown that promoting one acre of film-covered corn can solve the food security problem for one person. Therefore, the entire province will plant 100,000 acres this year. In addition to enjoying interest-free loans and development funds, impoverished counties will receive a special subsidy of 6 million yuan from the provincial finance department. Provincial-level production, scientific research, and educational departments have also organized training classes for technical personnel.

　　云南实施“温饱工程”
    本报昆明３月２３日电  云南实施“温饱工程”，日前已安排１００万亩地膜覆盖杂交玉米的种植计划，农用物资、资金等配套服务正逐步落实。该省１２５个农业县（市）中，有４１个贫困县。试验证明，推广一亩地膜玉米，即可解决一个人的温饱。为此，全省今年种植１００万亩。贫困县除享受贴息贷款和发展资金外，省财政安排专项补助经费６００万元；省级生产、科研、教育部门还举办了技术骨干培训班。
