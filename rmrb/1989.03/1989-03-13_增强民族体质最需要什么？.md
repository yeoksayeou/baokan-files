The debate around "The Dream of a Strong Nation" continued until the Seoul Olympics torch was extinguished. People faced with the current state of Chinese sports were at a loss for words. The truth in literature and the truth in life had a surprising collision.

In terms of my career in reportage literature, I would say I had some luck. However, the subsequent widespread discussions about Chinese sports issues across China were beyond my expectations.

I remember it was around 1985 when the Chinese women's volleyball team won another international competition. People were spreading the news and smiling with joy. In the early morning, I strolled towards the hospital opposite my residence. This was the largest medical center in the Taihang Mountains, named Taihang White Memorial Peace Hospital. There, I met several doctors who were enthusiastic about sports. When I shared the joy of the women's volleyball team's victory with them, our door was repeatedly pushed open. Surrounded by the moans of patients, my friends' enthusiasm was interrupted again and again.

In the corridors, on the small squares, everywhere were my fellow countrymen with faces as pale as vegetables, their sickly bodies bent over, and deep sighs coming from their mouths. Many patients came from the distant mountainous areas, and on the disorderly small carts, donkeys, and even wheelbarrows, there were rusty quilts and straw. The registration area was crowded with patients' relatives, who were arguing with each other.

What did they need? What was the relationship between Chinese sports and them? Where should Chinese sports go? This desolate scene lingered in my mind for a long time. This scene happened precisely at the moment when the women's volleyball team was at the height of its fame. The people of the mountains spoke without words, forcing me to start thinking coldly about Chinese sports for the first time.

I do not believe the claim that China has 300 million people participating in sports. Even if we assume that there are 300 million sports participants, how many times do my fellow countrymen go to the hospital each year? This was the first question that prompted me to think after witnessing that scene in the Taihang Mountains. I went to the local epidemic prevention station and health bureau to ask, but the answers were vague.

In the late 1970s, Chinese sports began to disappear from the playgrounds of children, from the high chimneys of factories, and from the "intellectuals' crowded" residential buildings. Sports were increasingly becoming the domain of a few. What was even more worrying was the spiritual and mental deficiencies caused by the new generation of children having no access to sports.

Some sports institutions had already started to pursue gold medals single-mindedly, and the allure of gold medals had blinded our eyes, to the point where this extremely abnormal phenomenon was considered normal.

Sports, as an advanced culture, were introduced into China and then assimilated by Chinese traditional culture. It was increasingly moving away from the essence of sports.

When I returned to my hometown in the Taihang Mountains, in that White Memorial Peace Hospital, I saw that scene again. The patients were the same, the noise was the same, and my fellow countrymen were the same. I returned to the deep contemplation of whether what is most needed to enhance the national physique is gold medals. Chinese sports cannot abandon them, abandon these fertile lands and mothers who nurture contemporary sports elites and will give birth to future sports elites. I said to myself: My elders, I am doing my duty.

　　增强民族体质最需要什么？
    赵瑜
    围绕《强国梦》的争论延续到汉城奥运会火炬熄灭。人们面对中国体育的现状，一时无语。文学的真实和生活的真实发生了一次惊人的碰撞。
    就报告文学创作生涯而言，我说我还有些运气。而后来遍及华夏的各式各样的关于中国体育问题的讨论，却是我所料不及的。
    记得是１９８５年前后，中国女排又一次在国际大赛中获胜，人们奔走相告，笑逐颜开。凌晨，我信步走向住所对过的一所医院。这是太行山区规模最大的一个医疗中心，名字叫太行白求恩和平医院。在那里我遇到几位热衷于体育的内科医生，当我和他们分享女排胜利的乐趣时，我们的门却被频频推开。在四周一片患者的呻吟的包围之中，我的朋友的谈兴一次又一次被打断。
    走廊里、小广场上，到处是面如菜色的我的同胞，他们抱病的躯体弯曲着，嘴里发出深沉的喘息。许多患者来自远郊的山区，一辆辆无秩序的小平车、毛驴车乃至独轮车上，铺陈着生锈的被褥和谷草。挂号处拥挤着患者的家属们，他们在争吵着。
    他们需要什么？中国体育究竟同他们是什么关系？中国体育应该向何处去？这怆凉的一幕，在我的脑海里久久不能散去。而这一幕恰恰是在女排声誉日高的一个胜利关头发生的。山区人以他们无声的发言，逼迫我第一次开始冷心肠地思考中国体育。
    我不相信中国拥有三亿体育人口一说。姑按体育人口果有三亿而论，那么，我的同胞们每年上医院看病的人次又是多少？这就是太行山上那一幕促使我思索的第一个问题。我到当地防疫站和卫生局去问，答者惘然。
    七十年代后期往后，中国体育开始从儿童们的操场上、从工厂高高的烟囱下，从“知识分子成堆”的杂居楼中消失、消失。体育越来越成为少数人的事情。而最令人焦急的是一代新生儿童因无缘于体育所造成的精神上心灵上的残缺。
    一些体育机构已经在单纯地追求金牌了，金牌迷闪了我们的眼睛，直至这种非常反常的现象被认作正常的事情。
    体育作为一种先进文化引入华夏以来又被中国的传统文化同化掉了。它越来越远离了体育的本质。
    当我回到了太行山上的故乡，在那所白求恩和平医院，我重又看到了那幕情景。病人依旧，噪杂依旧，同胞们依旧。我回到了对民族体质的增强最需要的是不是金牌的问题的深深的思考中。中国体育不能抛弃他们，抛弃这些养育着当代体育精英，并孕育着将来的体育精英的沃土和母亲，我在心中默默地说：我的父兄，我在尽我的责任。
