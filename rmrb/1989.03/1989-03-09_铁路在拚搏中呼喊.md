The year 1988 was the most challenging year for China's railways.

Derailments, collisions, and fires on passenger trains occurred frequently. Major passenger train accidents causing significant casualties happened one after another. For a time, public opinion across the country was in an uproar. Minister of Railways Ding Guanggen resigned to take responsibility for the nation.

Opinions on this varied. Some believed this handling was appropriate, that Ding Guanggen should have resigned long ago; others thought he was taking the fall for others, and this would not solve the fundamental problems of the railways.

So, what are the fundamental problems of the railways? Is it that the economic reform of the railway system is not thorough enough? Is it that the basic work is weak? Is it that the system is not strict, management is poor, labor discipline is lax? Is it that the quality of the workforce is poor? Or is it that political and ideological work is weak?

These undoubtedly contain correct elements, but they seem to miss the point. Because the above problems exist in various industries in China, not just in the railways. Why then do the railways become the prominent weak link constraining the development of the national economy, even causing so many serious problems?

Chinese railways have reached their limit. For freight, the main lines can only meet 70% of social demand, and for routes to Shanghai and Guangzhou, only 50% can be met. For passenger transport, it is peak season every day, with trains generally overloaded by 50% to 100%, and during the Spring Festival and summer, about 800,000 to 900,000 people stand while traveling every day.

Domestic and foreign experts and insightful individuals have pointed out the root cause: the fundamental problem is that the development of Chinese railways is seriously lagging behind.

The State Council's Economic, Technological, and Social Development Research Center, in its "Preliminary Study on China's Industrial Policy," analyzed the super-ratio of basic industries during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" and pointed out that the development ratio of railways was negative (railway construction was -0.05), belonging to the backward type. In fact, the lag in railway development is not limited to just the "Sixth Five-Year Plan."

Statistical data show that over the years, the growth rate of railway transportation volume has always lagged behind the growth rate of industry, and the increase in major railway transportation equipment has lagged behind the growth in transportation volume. From 1950 to 1987, China's industrial growth was as follows: raw coal increased 21 times, oil increased 670 times, steel increased 91 times, pig iron increased 55 times, electricity increased 107 times, cement increased 131 times, timber increased 9 times, fertilizers increased 1114 times, and the main indicators of railway transportation converted to ton-kilometers increased 20.6 times. However, the total length of operational railway lines only increased by 1.4 times, the total power of locomotives only increased by 6.5 times, the total number of passenger car seats only increased by 4.9 times, and the total tonnage of freight cars only increased by 12.1 times.

As a country with 9.6 million square kilometers of territory, China has only 52,600 kilometers of railways. In terms of per capita railway ownership, it ranks 100th in the world, and in terms of railway ownership per unit of land area, it ranks 70th in the world.

Chinese railways not only have fewer lines but also have poor equipment and low capacity. The double-track rate of railways nationwide is 22%, only two-thirds of that of the Soviet Union, and half of that of France and West Germany. The electrification rate is 11%, and the combined internal (internal combustion) and electric (electric locomotives) rate is only over 30%, while the Soviet Union's electrification rate reached 34% in 1985.

According to relevant departments, when the ratio of China's industrial output value to railway freight volume (elasticity coefficient) is 1:0.5, railway transportation is relatively adaptable to the needs of the national economy. Due to the long-term lag in railway development, the elasticity coefficient has been decreasing from 1:0.5 since the "Fifth Five-Year Plan" to 1:0.3, and by 1988, the elasticity coefficient had dropped to 1:0.147.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Railways, the average interval between trains on major national railway lines is less than 10 minutes. Even with such a high train density, it still cannot meet social needs. Every month, more than 5,000 people apply to the Railway Transportation Bureau for extra train cars.

Passenger transport is the same. Despite increasing passenger volume by 50 million trips per year, and nearly 1 billion trips in 1988, it is still overloaded every day.

Beijing Railway Station once conducted a survey, finding that 15,000 people want to leave Beijing every day but cannot. The reason is simple: they cannot buy train tickets.

Now, the concept of full-load operation is advocated, but railway workers are contributing beyond their capacity.

"Early 7 (7 AM start), late 8 (8 PM end), Sundays are wasted." This has become a common saying among railway officials and workers.

The Beijing Railway Section, during the Spring Festival in the previous year, was short of 1,000 people. Many train attendants completed one trip and then immediately started another, with some people working continuously for over 50 days without returning home.

On one hand, there are few pieces of equipment and low-level equipment, and on the other hand, there is high-intensity transportation and overloaded operation.

The transportation density of Chinese railways has reached 2,500 million ton-kilometers per kilometer, ranking second in the world. The annual output per locomotive is 1/5 higher than in the United States, the annual output per freight car is 2.8 times higher than in the United States, and the annual output per passenger car also ranks among the world's top.

When people praise these mostly 1950s equipment and technology for achieving economic benefits comparable to those of developed countries today, some rigorous experts sharply point out: operating like this is against scientific laws, it is at the cost of reducing the safety factor, and it will inevitably "pay the price."

Unfortunately, this came true. The series of tragic accidents that occurred on the railways in the first quarter of last year were serious warnings: Chinese railways have reached their limit. They are struggling and crying out in pain, and must take radical measures to address the root causes.

Under the pressure of rapid economic development, the proportion of railway construction investment has long been low and shows a downward trend. Moreover, in railway construction, there are cases of not considering economic benefits, arbitrary decisions, and blindly starting projects.

Railways are praised as the "forerunner of modern industrialization." Many economically developed countries in the world have gone through a period of concentrated investment and priority development in the early stages of industrialization.

China's industry is mainly distributed in the eastern coastal regions, while raw materials are mostly in the western regions. Grain is transported from the north to the south, and coal is transported from the north to the south. Railway transportation plays a crucial role. From the national conditions, railways should also be developed as the backbone of comprehensive transportation, with tilted investments and key development.

However, the reality is disappointing.

Under the pressure of rapid economic development, the proportion of railway construction investment in the total national investment shows a downward trend. From 1950 to 1952, it was 14.5%; during the "First Five-Year Plan," it was 10.7%; during the "Second Five-Year Plan," it was 9%; during the "Third Five-Year Plan," it was 12.3%; during the "Fourth Five-Year Plan," it was 10.5%; during the "Fifth Five-Year Plan," it was 6.4%. The central government clearly decided to make railways a key area for national investment during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan," but the proportion dropped to 4.5%. During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," it was less than 5%.

It is self-evident that the serious lag in railway development is directly due to insufficient investment.

However, under the extremely limited investment, there are also cases in railway construction of arbitrary decisions, blindly starting projects, and not considering economic benefits, such as building "political lines" and "war preparedness lines."

The Shaoshan Railway, built during the era of personal cult, now has few passengers and no goods to transport, resulting in severe losses. The Tong-Huo (Liaoning-Hulinhe) line was started without sufficient argumentation. The state invested 600 million yuan to build 420 kilometers of track with a capacity of 20 million tons, but the current volume is only 1/10 of the capacity, as there were originally not many goods to transport there.

The total industrial and agricultural output value and national income of the East China region account for 1/3 of the country. However, what about the railways? They only account for 1/10 of the country, and the per capita railway ownership is less than half of the national average.

Several retired comrades who have worked in railway leadership positions pointed out with self-reproach that they did not place railway development in a strategic position, invested insufficiently, and delayed construction, "this is indeed a strategic mistake." In fact, this responsibility should be borne by the national macro-decision-making departments. In the old management system, from management ideas to management methods, they all restricted the advanced development of railways.

Railways are social infrastructure, and their main function is to create social benefits. According to relevant departments, for every 1,000 million tons of coal for power plants transported to the East China region by railways, the local area can create an additional 20 billion yuan in industrial output value.

Social benefits should be higher than the enterprise benefits of railways. Many countries' fiscal subsidies for railways account for about half of the cost. China, however, has long emphasized the enterprise benefits of railways, treating railways as a department that provides a large amount of accumulation to the state, implementing low depreciation and high tax policies. Look at two sets of data:

The railway business tax rate was 25% in 1965 and 15% from 1972 to 1985. It was not only higher than the rates for transportation, aviation, and telecommunications departments (all 3%) but also higher than those for dance halls and billiard rooms (10%). In 1986, it was adjusted to 5%, which was still 66% higher than the rates for transportation, aviation, and telecommunications departments. From 1950 to 1985, railways paid a total of 115.6 billion yuan in taxes and profits to the state, which was 33 billion yuan more than the state's total investment in railways during the same period.

The low depreciation and high tax policies not only restricted the expansion and reproduction of railways but also resulted in annual deficits in simple reproduction. Chinese railways are now operating on steel ropes and the edge of a volcano. Not having accidents is lucky; having major accidents is a punishment.

The basic depreciation rate of railways was only 1% before 1980, far below the national industrial average of 3.92%; it was adjusted to 3% in 1980, 3.5% in 1985, and 4% in 1986, still below the national industrial average of 5.1%. If calculated based on the national industrial average, from 1953 to 1987, the railway transportation department accumulated 29 billion yuan less in basic depreciation funds.

Railways are a large interconnected system. The entire network has 3.2 million employees and over 5,500 large and small stations. Every day, 20,000 freight trains and 2,000 passenger trains run, crossing thousands of mountains and rivers. Everything is in motion, and if a key person is negligent for an instant or a critical component fails unexpectedly, it can lead to a disaster.

Among the national railways, 12,900 kilometers of rails are overused, including 120,000 damaged rails. There are over 96,000 roadbed diseases. Many tunnels and bridges are severely damaged. Signal equipment, from quantity to quality, does not meet the requirements. Currently, the Liuzhou Railway Bureau alone has 124 stations using oil lamps for signals, accounting for 62% of the total number of stations in the bureau. Among the 2,000 passenger trains running every day, 2,294 carriages are still from the 1935-1938 production.

The Shenshan Line, according to regulations, should be overhauled after running 5 billion ton-kilometers. Now, some sections have reached 13 billion ton-kilometers and are still in overuse.

The Datong Railway Bureau, which is responsible for half of the coal transportation out of Shanxi, has seen its transportation volume increase by over 10% annually for several years, far exceeding the capacity of the equipment. This bureau mainly transports coal from the Datong-Zhangjiakou section, and damaged rails are found every day. The bureau has no spare rails and can only cut and use old rails. To prevent derailment accidents, they specially dispatch people to guard the lines day and night, like taking care of a patient. The bureau chief said, "The task is pressing, and we have no way out, we can only do it this way."

In 1986, the labor system reform led to a wave of replacement strikes sweeping through the railways, with 91,000 people replacing jobs in the transportation department alone. A significant number of these people, without proper training, took up positions and worked independently, and their ideological, cultural, and professional technical qualities were obviously not up to the task.

"Big hats and high shoulders, railway employees have high treatment." In the past, people took pride in being a railway worker. Now, the new railway saying is "Contract responsibility system, the more you contract, the drier you get."

This is not to say that the contract responsibility system is wrong, but rather that the internal and external environment of the contract is too tight, and workers have not gained much personal benefit. In the three years of the contract responsibility system, the average wage income of railway workers has been below the average line of the energy and transportation departments. After deducting the factor of price increases, the average wage of railway workers in 1987 actually decreased (by -0.4%). How can railway workers not complain and grumble in such a situation?

Railways have many dirty, hard, dangerous, and responsible jobs. The Fengxi Electric Locomotive Section imported a batch of electric locomotives, needing to recruit 100 drivers, but only 20 people signed up, and only 2 were left in the end.

Such railways can be said to be operating on steel ropes and the edge of a volcano without exaggeration.

Railway freight rates have not been adjusted for many years, with freight per ton-kilometer costing less than 2 fen; for passengers, one egg can travel one stop. Low freight rates against high prices have put railways in a dilemma.

When the state formulates railway freight rates, it emphasizes the aspect of serving society, highlighting social benefits, and implementing a low freight rate policy.

Railways implemented unified freight rates in 1955, which have not been adjusted for many years. One ton of goods transported 1 kilometer costs less than 2 fen, equivalent to 1/11 of the road freight rate and 1/60 of the air freight rate. For passengers, one egg can travel one stop, and one roasted chicken can travel one day.

"Without adjusting freight rates, the contract responsibility system will be difficult to continue, and passenger and freight transportation will also be difficult to continue!"

This is the cry of the railways.

A private entrepreneur in Guangzhou said that transporting the same batch of goods by railway for 5,000 kilometers costs the same as transporting it by road for 500 kilometers. At first, he thought the railway staff had made a mistake, but when he confirmed it was correct, he could not help but say with some regret, "The railway is too cheap."

Container transportation, the cost per million ton-kilometers for railways is 266 yuan, but only 264 yuan is charged, resulting in a loss of 2 yuan. Perhaps only Chinese railways can do such a loss-making business.

Fuel prices, steel prices, and electricity prices are all rising, and railway expenditures are increasing year by year. According to statistics, from 1986 to 1988, railways increased their expenditures by over 6 billion yuan due to rising raw material and fuel prices.

On one hand, there are low freight rates and low depreciation, and on the other hand, there are high tax rates and high prices. Squeezed from both sides, railways are in a dilemma and have to rely on old equipment to get by. This is the crux of the railway transportation tension and the constraint on the development of the national economy.

An expert familiar with the railway situation said that railways must quickly adjust freight rates to get out of the dilemma. Continuing to rely on old equipment to get by will have unthinkable consequences.

It is now time to use the spirit of building the Daqing Oil Field to develop railways. If railway construction is not urgently addressed, by the end of the century, half of the passenger and freight volume in the East China region will be unable to be transported in and out. By then, talking about mistakes will be too late.

A railway friend once jokingly asked and answered himself: Who is China's largest strike force? It is the railways. Today, they rush to transport coal, tomorrow they rush to transport fertilizers, and the day after tomorrow they rush to transport grain.

At a small seminar, an expert excitedly said that since liberation, if railway investment could have maintained a reasonable proportion, Chinese railways would not be in today's situation.

Regrettably, even now, not everyone can recognize this.

To change the current situation of Chinese railways, the only way out is reform.

First, update concepts and truly recognize and follow the law of transportation first, accelerating the expansion of transportation capacity. Currently, the strategic position of railway transportation in the country should be firmly established, implementing tilted investments and moderately advanced development. According to domestic and foreign experts' arguments, China's railway investment should account for more than 10% of the country's construction investment.

Second, establish the concept of "comprehensive transportation," achieving water where appropriate, road where appropriate, and railway where appropriate, adjusting the transportation structure. It is no longer possible to cram everything onto the railways as it is now. Currently, China's transportation industry, whether railways, roads, waterways, aviation, or pipelines, are all lagging behind and need to develop synchronously. In synchronous development, based on national conditions, a comprehensive transportation system with railways as the backbone, a coordinated structure, and an appropriate scale should be established as soon as possible to achieve greater benefits with less investment. Currently, the advantages of roads, waterways, and civil aviation should be fully utilized to divert traffic from railways, reduce the pressure on the main railway lines as much as possible, give railways a chance to "breathe," and quickly address the "short legs" to undertake more arduous tasks.

Third, quickly and reasonably adjust railway freight rates, increase railway accumulation, and accelerate railway development. The relationship between railway freight rates and industrial and agricultural production prices and road, aviation, and waterway freight rates should be rationalized. This is not only beneficial to the development of railways but also to promoting the rational division of labor among various modern transportation methods, forming greater transportation capacity. Of course, the adjustment of railway freight rates should consider both the needs of railway development and the society's affordability.

Fourth, mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties to build and manage railways, changing the model of state-owned railway construction, and implementing joint construction of railways by the central and local governments. Practice has proven that local railway investment is cost-effective, has a short construction period, is flexible in operation, and has good benefits. It can open up channels, encourage multi-party funding, and vigorously develop local railways.

Fifth, railway construction should be scientifically argued, correctly decided, carefully calculated, and investment should be saved. Do not follow arbitrary decisions or blindly start projects, emphasize economic benefits, and achieve greater output with less input.

Sixth, manage and operate the existing railways well. Railways must ensure the transportation of national key materials, strictly prohibit the use of train cars and tickets for personal gain, and greatly improve the quality and level of passenger and freight services, truly becoming the "pioneer."

　　铁路在拚搏中呼喊
    本报记者  张国荣
    １９８８年，是中国铁路最难过的一年。
    翻车。撞车。客车着火。旅客列车重大伤亡事故迭出。一时间，全国上下舆论哗然。铁道部长丁关根引咎辞职，以谢国人。
    对此，议论颇多。有人认为这样处理好，丁关根早该辞职；也有人认为他是代人受过，这不能解决铁路的根本问题。
    那么，铁路的根本问题是什么？是铁路经济体制改革不彻底？是基础工作薄弱？是制度不严，管理不善，劳动纪律松弛？是职工队伍素质差？或是政治思想工作薄弱？
    这些无疑都包含着正确的成分，但又似乎都未说到点子上。因为，上述问题，在我国各行各业中都存在，并非铁路所独有，可为什么偏偏铁路成为制约国民经济发展的突出薄弱环节，甚至出了那么多严重问题？
    中国铁路已到了力量的极限。货运，主要干线只能满足社会需求的百分之七十，去往上海、广州方向只能满足百分之五十；客运，天天是高峰，列车一般超员百分之五十上下，高的达百分之一百，从春运到暑期，每天约有八九十万人站着乘车
    国内外专家和有识之士一语破的：根本问题是中国铁路发展严重滞后。
    国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心曾在《我国产业政策的初步研究》中，对“六五”期间基础产业超前系数作了分析，指出铁路发展的超前系数为负数（铁道铺设为—０．０５），属滞后型。其实，铁路发展滞后岂止一个“六五”期间。
    统计资料表明，多年来，铁路运量的增长速度总是落后于工业增长速度，而铁路主要运输设备的增加又落后于运输量的增长。从１９５０年到１９８７年，我国工业增长：原煤２１倍，石油６７０倍，钢９１倍，生铁５５倍，发电量１０７倍，水泥１３１倍，木材９倍，化肥１１１４倍，铁路运输主要指标换算吨公里增长２０．６倍，而铁路营业线总长度却只增加１．４倍，机车总功率只增加６．５倍，客车总席位只增加４．９倍，货车总吨位只增加１２．１倍。
    作为一个拥有９６０万平方公里国土的国家，我国仅有铁路５．２６万公里。按人均铁路拥有量居世界第１００位之后，按国土面积平均拥有铁路量居世界第７０位之后。
    中国铁路不仅数量少，而且装备差，能力低。全国铁路复线率２２％，仅为苏联的２／３，法国和西德的１／２；电化比重１１％，内（内燃机）、电（电力机车）相加不过３０％多，而苏联仅电化比重１９８５年已达到３４％。
    据有关部门测算，当我国工业产值和铁路货运量二者之比（弹性系数）为１∶０．５时，铁路运输比较适应国民经济发展的需要。由于铁路发展长期滞后，弹性系数自“五五”开始，从１∶０．５逐步降到１∶０．３，至１９８８年，弹性系数已降为１∶０．１４７。
    据铁道部统计，全国铁路主要干线列车平均间隔时间不到１０分钟。就是这么高的行车密度，也仍然满足不了社会的需要。每月有５０００多人到铁道部运输局申请要计划外车皮。
    客运也是如此，尽管每年增运５０００万人次，１９８８年几乎增运１亿人次，仍然天天暴满。
    北京火车站曾作过统计，每天有１．５万人想离开北京而走不了。原因很简单：买不到火车票。
    现在提倡满负荷工作法，铁路职工却在超负荷作贡献。
    “早７（七时上班）晚８（８时下班），星期天白搭。”这已成为铁路干部、工人的口头禅。
    北京列车段，去年春运，缺员１０００多人，许多列车员跑完这趟车又套跑另一趟车，有的人竟连轴转５０多天未回家。
    一方面是少数量的设备，低水平的装备，另一方面却是高强度的运输，超负荷的运转。
    我国铁路运输密度已高达每公里２５００万吨公里。居世界第２位，每台机车年产量比美国高１／５，每辆货车年产量比美国高２．８倍，每辆客车年产量也居世界前列。
    当人们称赞这些大多５０年代的设备和技术，赢得了与当今世界发达国家相媲美的经济效益时，一些严谨的专家尖锐地指出：这么干是违背科学规律的，是以降低安全系数为代价的，必遭“报应”。
    不幸而言中。去年一季度，铁路连续发生的惨痛事故就是严重的警告：中国铁路已经到了力量的极限。它在拚搏中呼喊，在痛苦呻吟，必须对症下药，采取根本性的解决措施。
    在经济高速发展的重压下，铁路建设投资比重长期偏低，且呈下降趋势。而铁路建设中不讲经济效益，长官意志，瞎指挥，盲目上马的事也非绝无仅有
    铁路，被誉为“现代工业化的先驱”。世界上许多经济发达国家在工业的初期，都曾走过密集投资、优先发展的道路。
    我国工业多分布在东南沿海地区，而原材料又多在西部，南粮北运，北煤南调，铁路运输具有举足轻重的作用。从国情出发，也应把铁路作为综合运输中的骨干，倾斜投资，重点发展。
    可是，实际情况却让人黯然神伤。
    在经济高速发展的重压下，铁路建设投资占全国总投资比例却呈下降趋势。１９５０—１９５２年为１４．５％；“一五”为１０．７％；“二五”为９％；“三五”为１２．３％；“四五”为１０．５％；“五五”为６．４％；中央明确决定“六五”把铁路作为国家投资的重点，可是比重却下跌到４．５％；“七五”这几年不到５％。
    不言而喻，铁路发展严重滞后，直接原因是投资严重不足。
    然而，在投资极其有限的情况下，铁路建设中，长官意志，瞎指挥，不讲经济效益，搞什么“政治线”、“战备线”，盲目上马的事也并非绝无仅有。
    个人迷信年代建设的韶山铁路，如今旅客稀少，无货可拉，亏损严重。通（辽）霍（林河）线，论证不足，就匆忙上马。国家投资６亿元，建成４２０公里线路，运能２０００万吨，现在运量只有运能的１／１０，原来那里并无多少货物可拉。
    华东地区工农业总产值和国民经济收入均占全国１／３。可铁路呢？只占全国１／１０，人均铁路拥有量不到全国的一半。
    几位从事铁路领导工作现已退下来的老同志，不无自责地指出，没有把铁路发展置于战略地位，投资不足，建设滞后，“这确实是一个战略失策”。其实，这个责任应当由国家宏观决策部门来负。在旧的管理体制中，从管理思想到管理方法，都是限制铁路超前发展的。
    铁路是社会的基础设施，其主要功能是创造社会效益。据有关部门测算，铁路向华东地区每增运１０００万吨电厂用煤，当地就可以多创造二百亿元工业产值。
    社会效益应当高于铁路的企业效益。许多国家对铁路的财政补贴占成本的一半左右。我国却长期强调铁路企业效益，把铁路当作向国家提供大量积累的部门，实行低折旧、高税收政策。请看两组数据：
    铁路上缴营业税率，１９６５年为２５％，１９７２至１９８５年为１５％，不仅比交通、航空、邮电等部门（均为３％）高，而且比舞厅、弹子房（为１０％）还高。１９８６年调整为５％，也比交通、航空、邮电部门高６６％。１９５０至１９８５年铁路向国家共上缴税利１１５６亿元，比国家在此期间对铁路总投资还多３３０亿元。
    低折旧，高税收政策，不仅使铁路扩大再生产受到限制，连简单再生产也逐年欠帐。中国铁路现在是在钢丝绳和火山口上作业，不出事故，是侥幸；出大事故，就是惩罚
    铁路基本折旧率１９８０年以前仅为１％，大大低于全国工业企业３．９２％的平均水平；１９８０年调为３％，１９８５年调为３．５％，１９８６年调为４％，仍低于全国同期工业企业５．１％的水平。若按全国工业企业平均水平计算，１９５３至１９８７年，铁路运输部门累计少提基本折旧基金２９０亿元。
    铁路是大联动机。全路现有职工３２０万，５５００多个大小车站。每天开行货车２００００列，客车２０００列，跨越千山万水，一切皆在动中，只要一个关键人物瞬间疏忽，一个要害部件意外故障，都会酿成灾祸。
    全国现有铁路中，超期使用钢轨１．２９万公里，其中有损伤钢轨１２万根。铁路路基病害有９．６万多处。不少隧道、桥梁严重失修。信号设备从数量到质量都不适应，仅柳州铁路局目前就有１２４个车站的信号使用油灯。占该局车站总数的６２％。每天开行的２０００列旅客列车中，有２２９４节车厢还是１９３５—１９３８年制造的。
    沈山线按规定跑５亿吨公里，钢轨即需大修。现在有的地段已达１３亿吨公里，仍在超期服役。
    承担着晋煤外运一半任务的大同铁路分局，几年来每年运量都以１０％以上的高速度递增，大大超出了设备的承受能力。这个分局运煤主要出口大同张家口段，现在每天都发现有重伤钢轨。分局没有备用轨，只得切割旧钢轨替用。为防止断轨翻车事故的发生，专门派人日夜值班，像看护病人一样看护线路。分局长说，任务压顶，我们没有退路，只能这么干。
    １９８６年，劳动制度改革，一场突击顶替风席卷铁路，仅运输部门就顶替上来９．１万人。其中相当数量的人未经正规训练，就顶岗独立作业，思想文化和业务技术素质明显不适应。
    “大盖帽垫肩高，铁路员工待遇高”。过去人们以当一名铁路职工为荣。现在铁路新民谚是“大包干，越包越干”。
    这并不是说大包干错了，而是说包干的内外环境太紧，职工个人并未得到多少实惠。大包干３年来，铁路职工平均工资收入水平在能源交通部门的平均线以下。扣除物价上涨因素，１９８７年铁路职工平均工资增长竟变成为负数（—０．４％）。这种状况怎么能让铁路职工不叫苦、不埋怨？
    铁路脏、累、苦、险工种多，责任大。丰西电力机务段，进口一批电力机车，需要招收１００名司机，报名的只有２０人，最后留下的仅２人。
    这样的铁路，说它是在钢丝绳上和火山口上作业并不为过。
    铁路运价多年不动，物运吨公里不到２分钱；客运，１个鸡蛋坐一站。低运价对高物价，使铁路陷入困境。
    国家在制定铁路运价时则强调了为社会服务的一面，突出社会效益，实行低运价政策。
    铁路１９５５年实行统一运价，多年不动。１吨货物运１公里不到２分钱，只相当于公路运价的１／１１，航空的１／６０。客运，一个鸡蛋坐一站，一只烧鸡坐一天。
    “运价不调整，大包干难以为继，客货运输也将难以为继！”
    这是铁路发出的呐喊。
    广州一位个体户讲，他运同样一批货物，铁路运５０００公里竟同公路运５００公里价钱相等。开始他以为铁路工作人员算错了，当他确认没错时不无感慨地说，铁路太便宜了。
    集装箱运输，铁路每万吨公里成本是２６６元，可只收２６４元，倒贴２元。大概只有中国铁路，才干这样亏本的买卖。
    燃料涨价，钢材涨价，电涨价，铁路支出逐年增加。据统计，１９８６至１９８８三年，铁路因原材料燃料涨价增加支出６０多亿元。
    一面是低运价、低折旧，一面是高税率、高物价，两面夹击，使铁路陷入困境，不得不长期靠拚设备吃老本过日子。这正是铁路运输紧张、制约国民经济发展的症结所在。
    一位熟悉铁路情况的专家说，铁路要走出困境，必须尽快调整运价，再靠拚设备吃老本过日子，后果将不堪设想。
    现在已到了用当年建设大庆油田的精神来搞铁路的紧迫关头。再不抓紧铁路建设，到本世纪末，仅华东地区就会有一半客货运量吞不进吐不出，到那时再讲失误，为时已晚
    一位铁路朋友曾开玩笑地自问自答：中国最大的突击队是谁？是铁路。今天抢运煤炭，明天抢运化肥，后天又抢运粮食。
    在一个小型座谈会上，一位专家激动地说，解放以来，如果铁路投资能保持一个合理的比例，中国铁路绝不会是今天的样子。
    令人惋惜的是，至今也并非所有的人都能认识到这一点。
    要改变中国铁路目前的状况，出路只有改革。
    第一，更新观念，真正认识和遵循交通先行的规律，加快扩大运输能力。当前，应当切实确立铁路运输在国家的战略产业地位，实行倾斜投资，适度超前发展。据国内外专家论证，我国铁路投资以占国家基建投资１０％以上为宜。
    第二，树立“大交通”的观念，作到宜水则水，宜路则路，宜铁则铁，调整运输结构。再不能像现在这样什么都往铁路上挤。目前我国交通运输业不论铁路、公路、水运、航空、管道，都很落后，需要同步发展。要在同步发展中，从国情出发，尽快建立起以铁路为骨干的，结构协调、规模适当的综合运输体系，以较少的投资，发挥较大的效益。当前，要充分发挥公路、水运、民航的优势，搞好对铁路的分流，尽可能减轻铁路主要干线的压力，让铁路有“喘息”的机会，抓紧补“短腿”，以便承担更加繁重的任务。
    第三，尽快合理调整铁路运价，增加铁路积累，加快铁路发展。要理顺铁路运价与工农业生产价格和公路、航空、水运运价的关系。这不仅有利于铁路发展，也有利于促进各种现代化运输方式合理分工，形成更大运输能力。当然，铁路运价的调整，既要考虑铁路自身发展的需要，又要考虑社会的承受能力。
    第四，调动各方面建设和管理铁路的积极性，改变国家独资修路的模式，实行中央和地方合资修路、合营铁路。实践证明，地方铁路投资省、工期短、经营活、效益好，可以广开渠道，鼓励多方集资，大力兴办地方铁路。
    第五，铁路建设要科学论证，正确决策，精打细算，节约投资。不搞长官意志，不搞盲目上马，讲求经济效益，以较少的投入取得较大的产出。
    第六，管理和经营好现有铁路。铁路必须确保国家重点物资运输，必须严格禁绝以车皮、车票谋私，大力提高客货服务质量和水平，真正当好“先行官”。
