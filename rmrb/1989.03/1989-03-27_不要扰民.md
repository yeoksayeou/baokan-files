The sixth and seventh issues of the *Outlook Weekly* this year report: On the night of January 9, it was raining and snowing in Zhengzhou. Two ordinary vans drove out of the train station. Seated in the vans were Comrade Zhao Ziyang and the responsible comrades from Henan Province who had come to welcome him. There were no police cars leading the way; just like other vehicles, they stopped at red lights and went at green lights. Comrade Zhao repeatedly instructed: “Do not disturb the people.”

This news made me deeply moved.

In recent years, some places have emphasized pomp and show, indulging in extravagance and waste, and this trend has been difficult to stop. Take, for example, the reception of some higher-level leaders or inspection teams and delegations. Often, police cars lead the way, and a fleet of small cars follows, sometimes even not allowing other vehicles to pass, which makes the people unhappy. I think this is probably not the intention of the higher-level leaders, but rather the doing of lower-level comrades for some reason. However, some leaders who accept this willingly only encourage such practices that alienate the people.

Of course, in special situations such as welcoming foreign dignitaries, using police cars to lead the way is understandable. However, when leaders go to the grassroots, it is ultimately to get close to the people and delve into reality. If police sirens are constantly blaring and there is a large entourage, the people will avoid them at all costs. How can one get close to the people in such a situation? Now, since the central leadership has set an example, various levels of leaders might as well learn from it and focus more on doing practical things for the people.

### “不要扰民”

　　“不要扰民”
    《瞭望》周刊今年第６—７期载：１月９日晚，郑州市雨雪交加，从火车站驶出两辆普通面包车，车上坐的是赵紫阳同志和前去迎接他的河南省负责同志。没有警车开道，同过往的大小车辆一样，红灯停，绿灯行。紫阳同志再三交代：“不要扰民”。
    这条消息使我感慨不已。
    近几年来，一些地方讲排场，摆阔气，铺张浪费之风屡禁不止。就拿迎送上级来的某些领导或检查团、代表团来说，往往是警车开道，小车成龙，有时甚至不让其他车辆通行，惹得老百姓不高兴。笔者想，这恐怕未必是上级领导同志的本意，而是下级同志出于某种考虑所为吧。但是某些领导欣然领受，就助长了这种脱离群众的做法。
    当然，遇到类似迎接外国贵宾等特殊情况，用警车开道并无不可。但是，领导同志下到基层，毕竟是为了接近群众、深入实际。如果动辄警笛长鸣，前呼后拥，老百姓避之唯恐不及，哪里还谈得上接近呢？现在，既然中央领导做出了表率，各级领导不妨学一学，把更多的精力放在为群众多办实事上。
