Dreaming of Drawing
— An Interview with Zhang Le Ping, the Father of "Sanmao"

Chen Li

The stone pillars and winding corridors. In the heart of Shanghai, within a bustling hospital, I search for an unfamiliar room number and a name familiar since childhood.

"Is Master Zhang Le Ping here?" I push open a dark red wooden door, only to see two elderly white-haired individuals sitting opposite each other in the sparsely furnished room.

The one closer to the window slowly rises from the wicker chair, his broad face and large eyes framed by slightly oversized winter clothing that cannot conceal his tall stature. Upon hearing that I had come specifically to invite him to write a creation talk for the "Sanmao Wanderings" for the Sea Swallow Publishing House, he eagerly pulled out the wicker chair, insisting that I sit down, while he moved to the hospital bed.

"I can't write much now. I have Parkinson's disease, and my hands shake. Otherwise, I can think and you can take notes." Master Zhang spoke in a Shanghai accented Mandarin.

The task was urgent, and I begged Master Zhang to find one or two of his previously published creation talks. He sighed and told me that he had been hospitalized for over a year, and his manuscripts and drawings at home were difficult for others to find. He himself could not easily slip out, and leaving the hospital required special permission. The conversation naturally turned to the internationally renowned "Sanmao Wanderings." Recently, American news broadcasts mentioned that Hong Kong had reprinted it, and there were also translations abroad, with sales increasing. In some places, a "Sanmao" craze had even emerged.

"But I haven't received a single reprinted sample book, it was a friend who got me a copy from Hong Kong." Master Zhang said, leaning over a small table piled with books and drawings to search.

"I remember when I was young, I saw your comics. There was one where Sanmao had his finger in his mouth, looking enviously at the little lamb and puppy nursing, and I almost cried."

"Ah, found it!" Master Zhang opened the sketchbook to the first page, which was indeed "Lonely and Helpless." He smiled, his eyes shining, but his voice trembled slightly, "When I conceived these six wordless sequential comics, I also shed tears. Have you noticed my signature on this page? Look for it!"

I looked through each one, until the last, but I didn't find Master Zhang's signature.

"Haven't found it yet? It escaped many people's eyes back then, even the inspection agencies didn't notice." With a mix of cunning and bitterness, Master Zhang's shining eyes clouded over, "Turn the drawing sideways and look from the back."

On the first frame, there were a few inconspicuous curved lines. Standing it up and looking from the back, there was indeed a free and elegant signature, 1947.

"There's a meaning here, it's injustice, a person standing up against injustice. Thinking back on our generation's life, it's been very difficult. During the Cultural Revolution, even such comics were labeled as poisonous weeds, and they forced me to tear them apart in public..."

"My heart is passionate, I dream of drawing." Master Zhang's face glowed with a reddish hue, his eyes even more radiant, "I want to draw a new 'Sanmao Wanderings.' Now, some children are wandering the streets, teachers can't manage them. Who should be blamed? This situation must be changed; if not, our descendants will curse us. How to change it? I want to look at the surroundings through a child's eyes, drawing out beauty and ugliness, drawing out goodness... to give children hope. Sometimes at midnight, when I think of it, I get excited, just like before, I will shed tears."

"Master, a set of drawings is like a short story, with touching plots and exciting endings, right?"

"Yes! This is a wordless sequential comic, it needs good ideas. I have already drawn the grid and outlined the lines. I think of something, then draw it down. As soon as I am discharged, I will start working on it."

"Looking forward to seeing your new work."

"Good!" As I left, Master Zhang extended a large, strong, and warm hand, firmly grasping mine.

　　做梦都在画
    ——访“三毛”之父张乐平
    陈丽
    石柱长廊，回旋楼道。在上海闹市一座医院里，我寻找一个陌生的房号和一个幼时就熟悉的名字。
    “张乐平老师在么？”推开一扇暗红色的木门，只见空荡荡的病房里两位白发老人相对而坐。
    靠近窗口的一位从藤椅里欠身缓缓站起，方脸，大眼，略嫌肥大的冬装掩不住他那高大的身躯。一听说我是专程前来约请他为海燕出版社写《三毛流浪记》创作谈的，他欣然拉开藤椅，非让我坐下，自己则挪到病榻上。
    “我现在写，有点困难。患了帕金森症，手有点抖。要不，我想想，一边说一边由你执笔。”张老一口上海味的普遍话。
    任务急，我央求张老将以前发表的创作谈寻出一二。他叹了一声，告诉我，住院一年多了，家中的文稿、画稿，别人难以找到，自己又不能随便溜出去，出院是要经特许的。话题自然而然就谈到蜚声海内外的《三毛流浪记》上。最近美国新闻广播中提到，香港翻印了，国外也有译本，销路愈来愈广，有的地方还掀起了“三毛”热。
    “可我一本重印样书也没得到，还是朋友给我弄到一本香港印的。”张老说了，趴到堆满书、画的小桌上翻找。
    “我记得小时候看您的漫画，有一幅画了三毛嘴里含着手指头，眼馋地瞅着小羊羔、小狗娃吃奶，我眼泪都快掉下来了。”
    “呵，可找到了！”张老翻开画册，掀到第一页，正是“孤苦伶仃”。他微笑着，两眼放光，声音却有点颤抖，“当年我构思这六幅无文连环漫画，也落泪了。你注意到这一页上有我的签名么？找找看！”
    我一幅一幅看过去，直到最后一幅，也没发现张老的签名。
    “还没找到吧？当年也躲过了好多人的眼睛，甚至连检查机关也没发现。”几分狡黠几分酸楚，张老闪闪放光的眼睛里浮上了几缕云翳，“把画横过来，从反面看。”
    在第一幅的框线上，有几道不显眼的曲线，立起来从背面看，果然有飘逸潇洒的签名，１９４７。
    “这里有寓意，就是不平，人立不平。回想我们这一辈人的一生，活得很艰难。文化大革命中，连这样的漫画也说成是毒草，硬要我当众一点点扯碎……”
    “我的心很热烈，做梦都在画。”张老脸上泛着红光，眼睛更加神采奕奕，“我想再画一部新的三毛流浪记。现在，有的小孩流落在马路上，老师管不了。应该归罪于谁？一定要改变这种状况；不改变，子孙要骂我们的。怎么改变？我想通过一个孩子的眼睛来看周围的事物，画出美和丑，画出善……，要给孩子们以希望。有时半夜里，想到激动处，也像以前，会流下眼泪。”
    “老师，一组画就像一个短篇小说，也有动人的情节和精彩的结尾，是吧？”
    “对！这是无文连环画，要有好的构思。我已经打好方格，勾好线。想到一点，先画下来。一出院，就动手。”
    “愿早日看到您的新作。”
    “好咯！”
    临别时，张老伸出一双大手，有力地温暖地握住我的手。
