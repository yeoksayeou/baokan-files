In the context of the national strategy to accelerate the development of coastal regions, how should a southwestern border province like Yunnan adjust its strategy and establish its own development plan? National People's Congress delegate and Governor of Yunnan Province, He Zhiqiang, brought his thoughts on this issue to the NPC session.

"Yunnan fully supports the development strategy for coastal regions," He Zhiqiang told the reporter. "The coastal economy needs to develop, and the southwest also needs to develop. This involves the reasonable adjustment of the layout and distribution of benefits between the central government and local governments, and between local governments. Overall, the economic relationship between the east and west of our country has not yet been fully sorted out, and some contradictions are still developing. The work is quite challenging."

This high-level engineering technician and Naxi ethnic governor said: "Yunnan is a province that receives subsidies from the central government, but the price difference of raw materials that Yunnan sends out at domestic prices is more than the national subsidies. We are considerate of the bigger picture. We hope that the country will gradually adjust policies to enhance the vitality of western development. This time, I will negotiate with relevant departments of the State Council, for example, whether it is possible to implement a single-item quota system for certain raw materials, allowing the province to have some discretion over the surplus production."

He believes: "Some comrades often vaguely discuss whether the focus of industrial layout should be in the east or the west. I think it is better to discuss this based on national industrial policies. For example, Yunnan's phosphate rock, which is exported in large quantities for processing, is not as cost-effective as focusing on local processing. As for the rubber industry, the coastal processing industry has already formed a pattern, and the transportation capacity it occupies is not large, so I support continuing to leverage coastal processing capabilities. Of course, we should also develop the processing industry. The southwest and the coast should seek to establish a new cooperative pattern in the development of commodity economy. It is increasingly difficult to rely solely on national administrative orders to regulate this."

"The important lesson from the coastal development strategy is to fully utilize the international environment to accelerate one's own development. We cannot help but think, if the coastline is a port, why can't the land border be a port?" This is the second issue that He Zhiqiang brought to Beijing.

Yunnan has a border line of over 4,000 kilometers, and it has geographical, economic, and historical advantages for developing trade with Southeast Asia. Within Yunnan Province, regions that rely on the east have developed faster, while border regions have lagged. He Zhiqiang pointed out: "For many years, due to political reasons, Yunnan's border has become a dead border. In recent years, with the favorable international situation, our direct trade with some countries, much of which is border trade, has gradually increased. But to truly form an inland port, we need the country to come up with a more comprehensive policy. Currently, the State Council does not have a single agency overseeing land ports, and we have to run to many departments for every matter. We propose that the country pay attention to solving this problem."

　　沿海在发展，云南怎么办？
    本报记者  朱维群
    在国家加快沿海地区发展战略中，云南这样的西南边陲省，应该如何因势调整、确立自己的发展谋略？全国人大代表、云南省长和志强带着对这个问题的思考来到人大会议上。
    “对于沿海地区发展战略，云南是全力支持的。”和志强对记者说，“沿海经济要发展，西南也要发展，这就涉及一个中央与地方、地方与地方之间合理调整布局、合理分配利益的问题。总的来看，我国东西部经济关系尚未完全理顺，有的矛盾还在发展，工作难度比较大。”
    这位高级工程技术人员出身的纳西族省长说：“云南是吃中央财政补贴的省，但是云南平价调走的原材料价格差价多于国家的补贴。我们是顾大局的。我们希望国家逐步调整政策，增强西部自身发展的活力。我这次将和国务院有关部门协商，例如，能否对某些原材料实行单项基数包干，超产部分给省里一些支配权。”
    他认为：“有些同志常常笼统地谈工业布局重点放在东部好还是西部好。我认为还是根据国家产业政策区别论证为好，例如云南的磷矿石，每年大量外运加工就不如重点在本地加工合算。而橡胶工业，沿海加工业已形成格局，所占运力又不大，我就支持继续发挥沿海加工能力。当然，我们也应该发展加工业。西南与沿海应当在商品经济发展中寻求建立新的协作格局，单纯依靠国家行政指令来调节，越来越困难了。”
    “沿海发展战略给人的重要启示就是，充分利用国际环境加快自身发展。我们不能不想到，海岸线是口岸，陆地边界为什么不能成为口岸？”这是和志强带到北京的第二个问题。
    云南边境线４０００多公里，在地理位置、经济结构和人文历史方面都具有开展对东南亚贸易的优越条件。云南省内历来靠东部的地区发展较快，而靠边境地区较慢。和志强指出：“多年来由于政治原因，云南边界成了一条死边界。这几年国际形势有利，我们与一些国家的直接贸易、其中大量是边境贸易逐渐增多，但要形成真正的内陆口岸，还需要国家拿出比较完备的政策。现在国务院对陆地口岸还没有一个总管机构，我们办每件事都得跑很多部门。我们提议国家重视解决这个问题。”
