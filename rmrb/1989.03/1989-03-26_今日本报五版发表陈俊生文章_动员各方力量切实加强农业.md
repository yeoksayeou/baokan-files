Today, the fifth page of this newspaper published an article by Chen Junsheng titled "Mobilize All Sides to Strengthen Agriculture."

The article states that China's agricultural development potential is immense. To achieve significant progress in agricultural productivity, the key lies in creating a dynamic economic mechanism that mobilizes all relevant forces to promote vigorous agricultural development. The success of China's rural reforms is not the result of a single measure but a comprehensive, coordinated effort. It is not realistic to rely on a single measure to achieve extraordinary results. Agricultural policies, science and technology, and investments should all be given priority.

The article emphasizes that agricultural policies should be tilted towards agriculture, science and technology should be tilted towards agriculture, and investments should be tilted towards agriculture.

    动员各方力量切实加强农业
    本报讯  本报今天第五版刊登陈俊生的文章《动员各方力量切实加强农业》。
    该文认为，我国农业发展潜力很大，要使农业生产力获得长足发展，关键在于能否创造一种动员各方面力量，促进农业生机勃勃发展的充满活力的经济运行机制。中国农村改革的成功，决不是某一项措施孤军深入，而是全面配套，综合起作用的结果，不能寄希望于某一措施出奇制胜。对农业政策要倾斜，科技要倾斜、投入要倾斜。
