Some major cities in the United States often come up with a slogan to boost their citizens' pride. For example, Boston is known as the "Cradle of Liberty," and San Francisco has the phrase "I Left My Heart in San Francisco." New York, as a major economic and cultural hub in both the United States and the world, is no exception.

"I Love New York" and "The Big Apple"

In New York's slogan "I Love New York," the word "love" is replaced by an apple, as New York is nicknamed "The Big Apple." According to the "American Slang Dictionary," any big city can be called "The Big Apple," or it can refer to the main commercial and entertainment district of a city. Another meaning is a fast-paced jazz dance called the Charleston that was popular around 1936. The reason this dance is called "The Big Apple" has some connection to New York. At that time, jazz music was sweeping across America, and many musicians performing in small towns around the country aspired to perform in New York to gain fame. Among them, there was a saying: "There are many apples on the tree, but performing in New York is performing the big apple." Thus, a dance called "The Big Apple" was born. Soon after, a nightclub named "The Big Apple" opened in the Harlem district of New York. From then on, "The Big Apple" became the nickname for New York City, but its main meaning is that New York is the proving ground for artists in various fields to demonstrate their achievements.

The Theater District of Broadway

When talking about New York's cultural life, the first thing that comes to mind is Broadway.

Broadway is a north-south avenue in New York that has become synonymous with the "Theater District." Because the lights here are bright all night, it is also known as the "Great White Way." In the area where the Sixth and Eighth Avenues intersect with 41st and 52nd Streets, there are about 30 theaters that perform shows every night, including serious dramas and musicals with singing and dancing. Musicals have become a lasting feature of Broadway, with some shows running for several years and thousands of performances.

The performances on Broadway, whether in terms of art or commerce, are generally mature works. Some works that are innovative in art but uncertain in commerce often first perform in "Off-Broadway" for trial runs. After a successful trial, they move to Broadway. Off-Broadway refers to small theaters scattered throughout Manhattan, and there are about 20 of them. In addition, there are even smaller "Off-Off-Broadway" venues, numbering over 100, with a wider distribution and different venues, including warehouses, basements, churches, and schools, some of which can only accommodate about 20 spectators. The quality of the performances varies, but many innovative works originate here. Many famous actors also first made their debuts here.

Seeing a show on Broadway can be quite expensive, with high-priced tickets costing several dozen dollars. Tickets can be purchased at the theater's box office from 10 AM until showtime. If purchased through a hotel or ticket agency, a service fee is required, the amount of which depends on how easily the tickets for that performance can be obtained. Most audiences coming here to watch shows use the Times Square ticket agency at the corner of 47th Street, which specializes in selling tickets for various Broadway theaters. The prices are cheaper, and buying two tickets only requires paying for one.

　　纽约的文化生活（上）
    董乐山
    美国一些大城市为了激发市民的自豪感，常常提出一句口号，比如波士顿是“自由的摇篮”，旧金山是“我把心留在了旧金山”等等。作为美国以至世界经济和文化重镇的纽约也不例外。
    “我爱纽约”和“大苹果”
    在纽约的口号——“我爱纽约”中，“爱”是用一只苹果来代替的，因为纽约的外号叫“大苹果”。据《美国俚语辞典》，任何大城市都可叫作“大苹果”，也可指一个城市的主要商业和娱乐区。另有一义是指１９３６年左右一度流行过的一种快节奏的爵士音乐舞蹈吉特巴舞。为什么把这种舞蹈叫作“大苹果”，则与纽约有些关系，当时，爵士音乐风靡美国，许多在各地小城镇巡回演奏的乐师都渴望到纽约演出，以获得成名的机会。他们中间流传一句话：“树上有许多苹果，但到纽约去演奏是演奏大苹果。”于是一个名叫“大苹果”的吉特巴舞诞生了。接着纽约黑人区哈莱姆开张了一家叫“大苹果”的夜总会。从此“大苹果”成了纽约市的外号，但它主要的含义还是指，纽约是各行各业艺术家证明自己成就的试验场。
    戏剧中心百老汇
    一提到纽约的文化生活，首先想到的莫不是百老汇。
    百老汇是纽约一条南北向大道，如今已成了“戏剧中心”的同义词。由于这里彻夜灯光明亮，又有“白光大道”之称。这条大道左右的第六号大道和第八号大道与第四十一号街和第五十二号街交叉的一个地区里，约有３０家剧院每天晚上上演节目，其中有正经八百的话剧，也有载歌载舞的音乐剧。音乐剧几乎成了百老汇一个经久不变的特色，有的剧目一演就是好几年、上千场。
    在百老汇演出的，不论艺术上或商业上，一般都是成熟的作品。有些艺术上创新而在商业上没有把握的作品，往往先在“外百老汇”作试验性演出，一炮打响了以后，再搬到百老汇来。外百老汇是指分散在曼哈顿的一些小剧场，甚至会议厅，总数大约有２０个左右。除此之外，还有规模更小些的“外外百老汇”，有１００个之多，分布更广，场地也不同，有空仓库、地下室、教堂、学校，有的地方只能容纳２０来个观众。演出质量参差不齐，但许多创新之作都发轫于此。许多名演员最初也是在这里崭露头角的。
    在百老汇看一场戏，票价惊人，高的需要好几十美元。从早上１０时到开演前可以在剧场售票处买票，如果通过旅馆或代售处，则需付一笔服务费，多少视该场演出的票是否容易购得而定。到这里来看戏的一般观众多半利用时报广场第四十七号街街口的一个代售处，那里专门代售百老汇各剧场的门票，价格便宜，买两张票只需付一张票钱。
