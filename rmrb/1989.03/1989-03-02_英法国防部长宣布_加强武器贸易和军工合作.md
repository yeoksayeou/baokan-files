	Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 28

	French Defense Minister Chevenement and British Defense Secretary Younger today announced in Paris that France and Britain have decided to increase arms trade between the two countries and expand cooperation in weapons development.

	The two defense ministers made the announcement at a joint press conference. Younger, who accompanied British Prime Minister Thatcher to the Franco-British summit, held talks with the French defense minister on bilateral weapons cooperation.

	Chevenement, speaking on the issue of military-technological cooperation between the two countries, pointed out that such cooperation is a "good way" to promote the military industry in Western Europe. He believes that "without a European military industry, there can be no European defense." To this end, France has proposed the "Eureka" plan aimed at weapons development.

	Younger, in his speech, expressed appreciation for France's readiness to participate in the future NATO air defense command system. He said that discussions between the two countries on this issue would lay a "good foundation" for France to join the system based on its position. It is reported that France's proposal to join the system is conditional on France's defense independence, as France is not part of the NATO military integration organization.

    英法国防部长宣布
    加强武器贸易和军工合作
    新华社巴黎2月28日电  法国国防部长舍韦内芒和英国国防大臣扬格今天在这里宣布，法英决定增加两国间的武器贸易，并扩大两国在武器研制方面的合作。
    两国国防部长是在联合举行的记者招待会上发表上述决定的。扬格在陪同英国首相撒切尔夫人参加法英首脑会议期间同法国防部长就两国武器合作问题举行了会谈。
    舍韦内芒在谈到两国军事科技合作问题时指出，这种合作是促进西欧军事工业的“好办法”。他认为，“如果没有欧洲的军事工业，就不可能有欧洲的防务”。对此，法国已倡议制定旨在武器研制的“尤里卡”计划。
    扬格在讲话中对法国准备参加未来的北约空中防务指挥系统表示赞赏。他说，两国就这一问题的讨论将为法国根据它的立场加入这一系统打下“良好的基础”。据报道，法国提出加入这一体系是以法国防务独立为条件的，因为法国不属于北约军事一体化组织。
