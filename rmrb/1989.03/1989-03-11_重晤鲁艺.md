Qiaozigou is located about 10 miles east of Yan'an City. It is an ordinary village in the mountains of northern Shaanxi. Nearly 50 years ago, the "Lu Xun Academy of Arts" was often referred to as Qiaozigou. A long poem by the poet Tian Lan (then a teacher at Lu Xun Academy) was titled "I Am a Citizen of Qiaozigou." However, there is a rare Catholic church here. The church is a Western Gothic-style building, with large, rough-textured base stones, green brick walls, arched doors and windows, and a spire with a cross towering into the sky. Surrounding the church walls is a winding stream that flows into the Yan River. It adds an exotic touch to Qiaozigou.

It seems that the builders had foreseen the future fate of the church. The quiet, staggered courtyard layout and the bright cave dwellings are perfectly suited for a school campus. Even the church's copper bell is suitable for signaling the start and end of classes, with its clear and resonant sound. Except for the teachers who mostly lived in the caves on the east side of the valley, the students mostly lived in the courtyard below the mountain. Large classes and lectures were usually held in the church. The church was also used as a dance hall for weekend dances and as a stage for rehearsals and performances. The square on one side of the church was also a sports field, often used for basketball and volleyball games. For collective activities such as going up the mountain to clear land or going into the city to attend meetings, everyone would gather here to depart. This original Catholic church had become a different kind of sanctuary. The students, all dressed in gray uniforms, lived austerely here, dedicating themselves to revolutionary art like saints.

For many years, I have longed to revisit my alma mater. Whenever I think of this, I remember Zhou Yang, who long oversaw the work of Lu Xun Academy, and some of the articles in the "Art Work Agreement" he formulated, which I can still recite; I remember Mao Dun, who taught the course "Chinese Urban Literature" at the Lu Xun Academy's Literature Department, and can still see his figure lecturing under the trees in the campus in photographs; I remember Xian Xinghai's creation of the "Yellow River Cantata" at Lu Xun Academy, which can be said to have its source in Lu Xun Academy. Shouldn't posterity remember them and everything about Lu Xun Academy?

In the summer of 1987, I, a former student of the Literature Department of Lu Xun Academy, had the opportunity to return to Yan'an for the first time. When I revisited my alma mater, I was moved and surprised. It was not that it had deteriorated beyond recognition, but rather that the sturdy brick-topped cave dwellings were still there, allowing me to immediately recall what they were used for and who lived there in the past. However, the layout and appearance had completely changed. It is said that it had changed hands several times, first becoming a local agricultural machinery repair factory and later a local pottery kiln. Each owner, according to their own convenience and temporary needs, demolished and blocked many places, making it chaotic and unrecognizable. Currently, it seems to be a dormitory and warehouse for the families of employees of a certain unit. The church has been turned into a warehouse, with its doors and windows nailed shut. Peering through the cracks, one can only see a dark, cluttered pile of debris. The church has indeed aged, with a large crack in one corner and the walls leaning outward. The employees' families hanging diapers to dry and cooking in the courtyard, and the few employees passing through the courtyard, all looked at me, the visitor, with strange glances, as if they had no idea that this place had once been a revolutionary art academy. There isn't even a single written marker here.

This made me think of the Revolutionary Memorial Hall in Yan'an, where the body of the white horse that Chairman Mao rode during the War of Liberation is displayed, meticulously preserved and occupying a bright and spacious exhibition room. At Wangjiaping, where Chairman Mao once lived (not his main residence), the small house where he once bathed and the wooden bathtub he used are both preserved for people to visit. Is the historical value of Lu Xun Academy less than that of a horse or a wooden tub? Chairman Mao once personally inscribed the motto "Unity, Seriousness, Hard Work, Modesty" for Lu Xun Academy, and the calligraphy was engraved on the wall of the campus square. Why is this not protected, allowing the wall to crumble and the characters to fade? I felt confused and contradictory, and personal worship cannot fully explain this. Then I thought of the inscriptions on the cliffs and pavilions at Qingliangshan. Those who were once students of "Antai" and "Lu Xun Academy" were listed alongside historical figures of the time simply because they held important positions. A random work by an attendant was even carved into a separate stele. Of course, this may not have been at the request of the person himself. Once something happens, even if the person strongly requests to keep it, it would be difficult to succeed. The cliff is not left with the scars of this excavation?

After returning to Beijing, the old people of Lu Xun Academy all asked me about my impressions of revisiting my alma mater. What should I say? I saw the fading of cultural and historical awareness, which left deeper marks on the Lu Xun Academy site than the erosion of the years, wind, rain, and heat. The church of Qiaozigou, like an old, deaf-mute person in twilight, with its cracks and leaning, symbolizes the cracks and leaning of culture and history. These are hard to express, so I could only answer: "It's hard to say in a few words."

However, I reassured them: The church in Qiaozigou was also the venue for the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, so there is a wooden cross sign by the muddy road in front of the church gate with the words "Site of a Certain Meeting." Fortunately, there is such a political reason, and the support of this political cross, so the cracked and leaning church will not collapse into a ruin with no markings for the time being.

　　重晤鲁艺
    朱寨
    桥儿沟在延安城以东１０多里，是一个普通的陕北农村山沟峁梁。将近５０年前，“鲁艺”前面常冠以桥儿沟，诗人天兰（当时鲁艺的教员）一首长诗的题目就叫作《我是桥儿沟的一个公民》。这里却有一座稀有的天主教堂。教堂是西方哥特式建筑，大块的糙纹基石，青砖墙面，拱门长窗，塔式尖顶，十字架高耸天空。绕着教堂的墙基，有一道曲溪汇入延河。它给桥儿沟点缀上异国的风彩。
    仿佛建筑者开始已预料到未来教堂的命运，幽静、错落的庭院布局，敞亮的窑洞设计，正适合作校园校舍，连教堂的铜钟，也适宜传达上课下课的号令，钟声嘹亮而悠扬。除了教员多住在沟内东山窑洞，学生们大都住在山下这庭院内。上大课，听报告，大都在教堂里面。教堂还是周末舞会的舞厅，排练演出的剧场。教堂一侧的广场，也就是运动场，常有篮、排球比赛。每有集体活动，如上山开荒，进城参加大会，都在这里集合出发。这原来的天主教堂，变成了另一意义上的圣堂。一律灰布制服的男女学生，在这里过着清苦的生活，像圣徒一样向革命艺术奉献虔诚。
    多少年，我期待着重晤母校。每念及此，我便想起曾长期主持鲁艺工作的周扬同志，他制定的“艺术工作公约”中的部分条文，我至今还能背诵；想起为鲁艺文学系开设过《中国市民文学》课程的茅盾先生，还可以在照片中重见他在校园树荫下讲课的身姿；想起冼星海在鲁艺创作的《黄河大合唱》，可以说这首音乐的黄河，就泉涌于鲁艺。对于他们，对于鲁艺的一切，后人不是应该去追念吗？
    １９８７年初夏，我这个当年鲁艺文学系的学生，第一次有机会重回延安。当我重晤母校的时候，我不免动情而且愕然了。倒不是它破败得已不复辨认，而是那些坚固的砖面平顶窑洞依然健在，使我可以立刻想起当年曾做何用，谁曾居住，但格局面貌已全非。据说它曾几经易主，先是做当地农机修理厂；后归当地陶瓷窑。几届主人根据各自的方便和临时需要，拆除和堵塞了不少处，零乱得不成格局。目前看来似乎是某一单位的职工家属宿舍兼库房。教堂作了库房，门窗钉封。从隙缝向里瞧，只见黑洞洞废料杂物堆积。教堂确实苍老了，一角裂开了大的立缝，墙壁在向外倾斜。出屋来晾尿布、生炉子的职工家属和路过院落的个别职工，对于我这个来访者投以奇怪的目光，好像他们根本不知道这里曾经是一个革命艺术学院。这里竟然连一个文字的标记也没有。
    这不能不使我想到，在延安革命纪念馆里陈列着毛主席解放战争时骑过的一匹白马遗体，被修整得栩栩如生，独占了一间明亮宽敞的展览室。在王家坪毛主席曾居住的地方（并不是他的主要居留处），他一度用来洗澡的小平房和使用过的木澡盆，都珍护着供人瞻仰。难道鲁艺的历史价值不如一匹马、一个木盆？当年毛主席曾手书“团结、严肃、刻苦、虚心”给鲁艺作为校训，手迹放大深刻在校园广场的墙壁上。这为什么不加保护，让墙圮字泯？我感到困惑矛盾，单用个人迷信不能完全解释。于是我又想到清凉山某窟穴、游亭处的碑石题刻。当年不过是“抗大”、“鲁艺”的学员，因为身居要职，便与时代历史名人并列题刻。一位随从者的即兴之作，居然也单独立碑镌刻。当然，这不一定出于本人的要求。一旦有变故，即使本人强求保留也难如愿。崖壁上不是又留下因此挖补的狼藉吗？这又是什么迷信崇拜？
    我回京后，鲁艺老人见面都问我重晤母校的观感。我说什么呢？我看到的是文化、历史意识的淡薄，比岁月的风雨暑寒的侵蚀，给鲁艺校址留下了更深的斑痕，当年的教堂如垂暮聋哑老人，以它的断裂倾斜暗示文化历史的断裂倾斜。这些都难以言传，我只好回答：“一言难尽”。
    不过，我告慰他们：桥儿沟教堂还曾是中共中央六届六中全会开会的会场，因此教堂门前泥路旁立有写着某某会址的十字木牌。幸有这样的政治原因，有这个政治十字架的支撑，断裂倾斜的教堂一时还不至于坍塌成没有任何标记的废墟。
