The Afghan Seven-Party Alliance Provisional Government held its first cabinet meeting since its establishment last month in Afghan territory. The meeting discussed the current battle situation in Jalalabad.

According to a representative of the Afghan Seven-Party Alliance, the provisional government, led by President Mujaddidi, convened this meeting in the Shauoi guerrilla training camp in Paktia Province, 12 kilometers from the Pakistani border. Mujaddidi stated, "The top priority of the Mujahideen government is to overthrow the Najibullah regime by force," and expressed the hope that the next meeting would be held in a location near Kabul.

He added that the Afghan Mujahideen would soon capture "all major cities, including Kabul."

Reports indicate that the Kabul regime has expressed confidence in winning the battle in Jalalabad, located 150 kilometers east of Kabul.

Diplomatic sources in Islamabad quoted a spokesperson from the Kabul regime's Foreign Ministry as saying that the Jalalabad airport, as well as various military outposts and districts in the city, remain under government control.

Seven of the 14 cabinet ministers attended this secret meeting. Two member organizations of the Seven-Party Alliance, the Afghan National Islamic Revolutionary Front led by Gailani and the Afghan Islamic Party (Khalis faction) led by Khalis, did not attend due to political disagreements with the provisional government president and other party leaders.

Diplomatic sources say that the Seven-Party Alliance provisional government held its first cabinet meeting in Afghan territory on the eve of the Islamic Conference Organization's foreign ministers' meeting scheduled for March 13 in Saudi Arabia. This move is aimed at garnering more support from countries, especially Islamic nations.

Reports indicate that the battle between the Afghan Mujahideen and government forces in Jalalabad is still ongoing. Some wounded have been transported to the International Red Cross in Peshawar, Pakistan, for treatment.

　　阿七党联盟临时政府内阁会议
    讨论贾拉拉巴德局势  寻求更多国家的支持
    新华社伊斯兰堡３月１１日电  据阿富汗７党联盟人士今天说，阿富汗７党联盟临时政府昨天在阿富汗境内举行自上个月成立以来的第一次内阁会议，讨论了贾拉拉巴德当前的战斗形势。
    临时政府总统穆贾迪迪在距离巴基斯坦边界１２公里的帕克蒂亚省游击队训练营地沙沃伊召开的这次会上说，“用武力推翻纳吉布拉政府是圣战者政府的首要任务”，并希望不久在喀布尔附近的某个地方举行下次会议。
    他说，阿富汗游击队在不久的将来将攻克包括喀布尔在内的“所有大城市”。
    据报道，喀布尔政权方面表示，它将赢得在喀布尔以东１５０公里贾拉拉巴德进行的这场战斗。
    此间外交界人士援引喀布尔政权外交部发言人的话说，贾拉拉巴德机场以及该城的各军事哨所和各区仍在政府军的控制之下。
    ７党联盟人士说，１４名内阁部长中的７人出席了这次秘密会议。７党联盟的两个成员组织，盖拉尼领导的阿富汗全国伊斯兰革命阵线和以哈利斯为首的阿富汗伊斯兰党（哈利斯派），由于同临时政府总统和其他党派领导人在政治上的某些分歧，没有出席这次内阁会议。
    外交人士说，在定于３月１３日在沙特阿拉伯召开的伊斯兰会议组织外长会议前夕，７党联盟临时政府在阿富汗境内举行第一次内阁会议，是为了争取更多国家，特别是伊斯兰国家的支持。
    据报道，阿富汗游击队同政府军在贾拉拉巴德展开的战斗目前仍在进行，一些伤员已被运送到巴基斯坦白沙瓦的国际红十字会接受治疗。
