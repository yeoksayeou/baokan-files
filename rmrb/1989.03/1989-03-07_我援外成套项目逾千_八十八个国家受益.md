Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th.

China has provided over 1,200 complete aid projects to 88 countries since it began offering overseas aid in 1954. These projects cover various fields such as agriculture, light industry, metallurgy, electricity, transportation, and municipal engineering. They have played a positive role in helping developing countries build their national economies and enhance self-reliance.

In recent years, China has adopted methods such as participating in management and cooperative management to assist recipient countries in managing enterprises, ensuring that Chinese aid projects operate efficiently after completion. For instance, the Tanzania-Zambia Railway, built with Chinese aid, has been profitable every year since Chinese experts began participating in its management.

Li Lanqing, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, stated at the opening of the 1989 Second National Overseas Aid Mechanical and Electrical Products Ordering Conference yesterday that overseas aid should be treated as a key national task. Priority should be given to ensuring the supply of raw materials, fuel, and transportation arrangements. Production plans should be strictly implemented, and a rigorous production management and quality inspection system should be established to ensure product quality. The goal is to elevate the production and supply of overseas aid mechanical and electrical products to a new level. The conference recognized several advanced units and individuals for their outstanding work in supplying overseas aid mechanical and electrical products.
