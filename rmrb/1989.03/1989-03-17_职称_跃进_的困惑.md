Title: The Confusion of "Leap Forward" in Professional Titles

Edition: 5

The joint initiative by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Huabei Pharmaceutical Factory, and our newspaper, titled "Hot Topics Among Youth," has received enthusiastic support from young people across the country. We have received a large number of submissions. Due to the limited number of editors, we are unable to respond to each submission individually, and we will not return unused manuscripts. We appreciate your understanding.

During the "Great Leap Forward," a commune could establish hundreds of factories in a single day. As long as you made a sign out of wooden boards or hard paper, a garbage dump could become a fertilizer factory, and a shoe repair stall could become a shoe factory.

Nowadays, in many places, the "reform" of professional titles is also experiencing a "Great Leap Forward." Promotion requires a certain level of education. Without it, one must pass an exam equivalent to that level. Thus, many people who have long passed their prime reading years are picking up books again. In just a week or two, most of them surprisingly pass the exam. Consequently, the knowledge structure changes rapidly, and the number of people with professional titles increases dramatically. The speed of development in one year is equivalent to that of several decades in the past. Isn't this a "Great Leap Forward"?

Facing these "supermen," "superwomen," "super elders," and "super matriarchs," even Yang Zhenning and Tsung-Dao Lee would probably sigh in admiration; if Nobel were alive, he might stand in respect.

How can "supermen," "superwomen," "super elders," and "super matriarchs" leap from elementary or middle school level to vocational or college level in just a few hundred hours? The scientificity of the method has also "leaped forward," not as simple and disgusting as the upgrading of garbage dumps and shoe repair stalls in the 1950s. There are exam papers and invigilators, all very formal. What is not seen is the forced growth. The exam papers are easily obtained to the point of being "infinitely easy." In a certain city, the college-level English exam covered only the first fifteen pages of the first year of middle school, and a notice was issued in advance; the exam discipline was relaxed to the point of being "infinitely loose," returning to the era of "allowing book flipping and whispering." In a certain factory, the invigilators were even invited to "another room to drink tea." Daring to speak out, this was done by the Weaving and Dyeing Factory in Xingtai City. (See the February 14 issue of China Youth Daily).

The "Great Leap Forward" confused the national economy with falsehoods and substandard products, leading to the subsequent "three years of disaster," causing great suffering for people of all ages. With thousands of "fertilizer factories," why build a chemical fertilizer factory? With "shoe factories" everywhere, the shoe industry certainly does not need to develop. The "Great Leap Forward" in the reform of professional titles will also have endless troubles. If the position of senior designer in a design institute is occupied by those who have "leaped forward" in knowledge, what awaits is high consumption and low efficiency, and the accumulation of irrational designed products; if a factory director who cannot even explain Ohm's law to a child suddenly becomes an "engineer," the child will throw away his schoolbag and never want to study again. The child's innocence is blameless: since one can easily "leap forward" to a college level when grown up, why bother to study hard now? If these current or future "knowledge workers" are transferred to Zhongguancun in Beijing, even after a hundred years, the moon will not bear the footprints of Chinese people.

　　职称“跃进”的困惑
    杨树森
    由团中央、华北制药厂与本报联合主办的《青年热门话题》有奖征文自征稿以来，得到广大青年的热情支持，来稿十分踊跃。因编辑人手所限，不能对来稿逐篇复信提出意见，稿件不用也就不退稿了，敬请作者谅解。

    “大跃进”期间，一个公社一天能办起几百个工厂；只要用木板或黄板纸之类的硬东西做个牌子，垃圾堆便是肥料厂；修鞋摊便是制鞋厂了。
    如今在不少地方，职称“改革”又“大跃进”了。晋级需要有一定学历。没有，则要通过相当于其水平的考试。于是，一些早过最佳读书年龄的人纷纷拿起书本，只个把星期功夫，其中绝大多数居然过了关。进而，知识结构骤变，有职称的人数猛增。其发展速度一年等于过去几十年，这不是“大跃进”么？
    面对这些“神男”、“神女”和“神叟”、“神妪”，杨振宁、李政道们大概也会自叹不如；诺贝尔如在世，恐怕也要肃然起敬。
    几百小时之内，何以使“神男”、“神女”和“神叟”、“神妪”由小学、初中水平一下子“跃进”到中专、大专水平呢？其方法的科学度也有“跃进”，不像五十年代对垃圾堆和修鞋摊升级那样简单得令人呕吐。既有试卷，也有监考，堂而皇之。见不得人的则是拔苗助长。试卷容易到了“无穷易”。某市考大专英语，命题的范围是初中第一册前十五页，事先还出了“安民告示”；考试的纪律也松到“无穷松”，退到“可以翻书，可以交头接耳”的年代。某厂考试，监考人员竟被请到“另室喝茶”。斗胆明说一下，此乃邢台市织染厂所为。（见二月十四日《中国青年报》）。
    “大跃进”中以假乱真、以次充好扰乱了国民经济，导致了后来的“三年灾害”，使全国老老少少吃尽了苦头。有成千上万个“肥料厂”，还建化肥厂干什么？“制鞋厂”星罗棋布，制鞋业当然无须发展。职称改革“大跃进”也会是后患无穷。设计所的高级设计师岗位如果让真是靠“大跃进”跃来的“知识分子”占据了，等待着的将是高消耗低效率，将是设计不合理产品的积压；一个连欧姆定律也辅导不了孩子的厂长一旦荣膺“工程师”，孩子便会扔下书包再也不肯上学。孩子的天真无可指责：既然长大后可以轻而易举地“跃进”为大专水平，何必现在苦读寒窗？将现在的或将来的这类“知识分子”调到北京中关村，即使再过一百年，月球上也绝不会印上华籍华人的足迹。
