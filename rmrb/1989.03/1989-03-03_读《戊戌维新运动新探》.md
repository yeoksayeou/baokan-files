Column: Book Reviews

Six years ago, I had the opportunity to work with Comrade Dai Yi on the editorial committee for the second volume of "Biographies of Qing Dynasty Figures." This is how I came to know Comrade Kong Xiangji. At that time, he had already published articles such as "The Alteration and Causes of the 'Hundred Days' Reform Memorials' and 'A Study of Kang Youwei's Reform Memorials in the Hundred Days,'" beginning to show a unique approach in his research on the history of the Hundred Days' Reform. After knowing each other for a long time, I found that Comrade Kong Xiangji has a tenacious spirit and a broad perspective, with deep insights into the history of the Hundred Days' Reform. Recently, he has published nearly a million words of articles, covering the thoughts and activities of Kang Youwei and other reformers, the complex relationships and struggles between various political factions during the reform movement, and the entire process of the movement's rise, development, and failure. It can be said that he has provided a systematic and relatively comprehensive account of the Qing Dynasty's New Policies. Therefore, I suggested that he select several representative works reflecting various aspects of the reform movement, compile them into a collection, and publish it through a publishing house, so that scholars, university history majors, and those who enjoy reading historical books can refer to it, and it will also help promote the study of the history of the Hundred Days' Reform.

After Comrade Kong Xiangji selected the articles to be included in this collection, I read them again. As the first reader, I feel obliged to provide a review.

It is undeniable that for a long time, the research and accounts of the Hundred Days' Reform have largely relied on books and pamphlets published and circulated in the market, occasionally supplemented by a small amount of manuscript or copied records. Most of these materials are reliable, but there are also some discrepancies and inaccuracies. Liang Qichao once frankly admitted: "Twenty years ago, I wrote 'A Record of the Hundred Days' Coup.' Later, those who wrote the history of the Qing Dynasty considered it a valuable historical source. However, to say that everything recorded is true history, I no longer dare to claim. Why? Because it was influenced by emotions, and the truth was exaggerated." (Collected Works of the Ice-Drinking Room, Volume 73, Page 91). From this, we can see that the history of the Hundred Days' Reform written based on materials published in the market or privately stored is rigorous and can be considered reliable, but it is difficult to ensure that all the content is completely true.

The value of this collection lies in the fact that the included articles are based on the author's exploration of the archives related to the Hundred Days' Reform stored in the First Historical Archives of China, and then comparing and collating them with the published editions circulating in the market. Archives have always been recognized by historians as the most original historical materials, and the Hundred Days' Reform was mainly initiated and deployed by the Qing Dynasty rulers, and then suppressed and abolished by themselves. Therefore, the archives retained by the Qing government to this day are the original records that must be consulted to understand and study this reform movement. In 1958, the Commercial Press published "Archival Materials on the Hundred Days' Reform," but it only included 430,000 words, which is only a small part of the vast archives. Comrade Kong Xiangji, with this in mind, began his research on the history of the Hundred Days' Reform by delving into the First Historical Archives of China, diligently and tirelessly, year after year, sifting through the dusty case files and books, browsing and copying, enduring several winters and summers, before finally sorting and arranging Kang Youwei's memorials from the 25th year of the Guangxu reign to the 26th year. The hard work involved can be imagined. Take Kang Youwei's "Third Memorial to the Qing Emperor," for example. As Comrade Kong told me, this memorial had long been torn into three parts in the piled-up case files, with the beginning and end separated and filed in different volumes. However, he did not hesitate to carefully search and verify in pile after pile of volumes, and after several months of concentrated effort, a complete "Third Memorial" was finally restored. This not only helps to clarify many controversial issues but also restores a precious historical artifact for the National Archives. It is precisely because of such arduous desk work that Comrade Kong Xiangji was able to write one article after another on the Hundred Days' Reform, with solid historical evidence and fresh insights.

It is also worth mentioning that the author's efforts in collecting and organizing archival materials are not aimed at continuing the old tradition of historians who consider the verification of historical events as the ultimate goal of historical studies. Instead, he adheres to the scholarly method of possessing a large amount of materials and conducting research on the history of the Hundred Days' Reform based on reliable historical facts, exploring its development laws and the internal connections of the entire event, so as to provide a scientific and materialistic interpretation of this major historical event. Most of the articles in this collection have this significance. For example, "A New Discussion on the Causes of the Failure of the Hundred Days' Reform" and "Guangxu and the Hundred Days' Reform" demonstrate the author's careful consideration, not being confined to established views, and using sufficient and reliable materials to attempt to explore the historical laws of the success and failure of the Hundred Days' Reform. Of course, it cannot be said that all the views expressed in the articles in this collection have become definitive and have no room for others to comment. Rather, in the various aspects discussed in the articles, the author's views generally provide further avenues for exploration or valuable opinions for reference in the study of the history of the Hundred Days' Reform.

To be honest, Comrade Kong Xiangji's research on the history of the Hundred Days' Reform in recent years has already shown promise, but some issues are still not completely resolved. For example, in his most extensive exploration of Kang Youwei's "Hundred Days' Reform Memorials," there are still a few unresolved issues. For instance, the "Preface to the Memorials of the Hundred Days' Reform" by Mai Zhonghua attached to the book states: During the Hundred Days' Reform, the master wrote sixty-three memorials by hand, outlining the general principles of a generation of reforms, and some were written by others. After the Hundred Days' Reform, many were lost, and even the titles could not be remembered. However, the "A Study of Kang Youwei's Reform Memorials in the Hundred Days" compiled in this collection lists sixty-six articles, three more than what Mai Zhonghua mentioned. Among these sixty-six articles, which ones were written by Kang Youwei? Which ones were written by others? Are there any cases of mistaken attribution? These issues may not be crucial, but if they can be explored and clarified, it will be helpful in restoring the "true record" of the Hundred Days' Reform movement.

    读《戊戌维新运动新探》
    林增平
    六年前，由于参加戴逸同志主持的《清代人物传稿》（下编）编委会，遂得以与孔祥吉同志订交。那时，他已发表了《〈戊戌奏稿〉的改篡及其原因》、《康有为戊戌年变法奏议考订》等论文，开始显露了在戊戌维新史的研究中另辟蹊径的势头。相识既久，我发现孔祥吉同志确有一股锲而不舍的韧劲，对戊戌变法史的研究，视野更广阔，思路也颇深邃。到近期，发表的文章已近百万字，内容涉及康有为等维新派的思想和活动，变法运动中朝野各派政治力量之间纵横离合、扑朔复杂的关系及其斗争，整个运动的兴起、发展及其失败的过程，可以说对清末维新新政有了系统和较全面的论述。因此，我建议他选录若干分别反映维新运动各个方面的代表作，辑为一集，交出版社出版，以便学术界同人和高校历史专业学生以及爱好浏览历史书刊的人们披阅参考，且有助于推进戊戌维新史的研究。
    经祥吉同志自行选录在本集中的论文，我又通读一遍。作为第一个读者，似乎有义务首先对此作出评述。
    不容讳言，长期以来人们对戊戌变法的研究和叙述，其资料来源，一般是大量取自坊间刊印流传的书刊，间或杂以少量手稿或抄本的纪述。这些资料，大部分是可信的，但也存在或多或少传闻异词之失，也难免某些隐讳失真之弊。梁启超就曾坦率地承认：“吾二十年前所著《戊戌政变记》，后之作清史者记戊戌事，谁不认为可贵之史料。然谓所记悉为信史，吾已不敢自承。何则？感情作用所支配，不免将真迹放大也。”（《饮冰室合集》专集之七十三，第91页）。据此可知，只凭坊间刊刻或私家所存史料撰述的戊戌变法史，其严谨者自应称作信史，但要使所述内容悉与“真迹”吻合，则显然难以做到。
    这本集子的可贵之处，就在于所收论文系作者从查阅现藏于中国第一历史档案馆中有关戊戌维新的档案入手进行探索，并以之同坊间流传的刊本对照校勘，从而加以分析研究所获致的成果。档案，历来为史家公认最为原始的史料，而戊戌变法，又主要是清朝统治者自行发动和部署，旋又自行加以取缔和废止的。因此，迄今保留下来的清政府的档案，就更属了解和研究这一变法运动必须查阅的原始记录。1958年，中华书局曾出版过《戊戌变法档案史料》一书，但仅刊录了43万字，毕竟只是汗牛充栋，仅档案中很少一部分。祥吉同志正是有鉴于此，因而在开始研究戊戌变法史时，就一头扎进了中国第一历史档案馆，孜孜不倦，兀兀穷年，在山积尘封的案卷遗书中爬罗剔抉，浏览抄录，经历几度寒暑，才将康有为从己未至戊戌的奏折梳理排比，整理出来。此中艰辛，是可以想象得到的。就以康有为的《上清帝第三书》来说，据小孔告诉我，这份上书在垒砌成堆的案卷中久已被割裂为三部分，头尾脱离，且归入不同的卷宗。而他却不惮其烦，细心地在一叠叠的卷宗中检索校核，经几个月聚精会神地梳理，一份完整的《第三书》才得以“破镜重圆”。这就不仅能借以澄清不少聚讼纷纭的问题，而且为国家档案馆修复了一件弥足珍视的历史文物。正由于经历了如此艰难备尝的案头劳作，祥吉同志才得以撰写出一篇篇史事确凿、新意盎然的有关戊戌变法的学术论文。
    还值得提出的是，作者致力于档案资料的搜集和整理，并不是旨在继承旧时代史学家以考订史事为历史学终极目的之旧传统，而是本着占有大量资料，以确凿可信的史实为基础的治学方法，来进行戊戌变法史的研究，探索其发展规律和全部事变的内在联系，俾可对这一重大历史事件作出科学的、唯物主义的论述。本论文集中的大部分文章就具有这种意义。如《戊戌维新失败原因新论》、《光绪与戊戌维新》等即表现了作者思虑周密，不囿于成说，以充分可靠的资料为依据，试图探索戊戌变法成败之历史规律的治学态度和方法。当然，不能说作者在本集所收论文中所表述的见解都已经成为定论，没有他人置喙的余地。而只是在论文涉及的各个方面，作者所陈述的看法，一般都为推进戊戌变法史的研究提供了进一步探索的途径或值得参考的意见。
    实事求是地说，祥吉同志近年对戊戌变法史的研究虽已崭露头角，但有些问题也并不能认为已经圆满地解决，扫数了结。比如，以他探索最多的康有为《戊戌奏稿》来说，就还有少量未曾弄清的问题。如该书所附麦仲华所撰《南海先生戊戌奏稿凡例》称：戊戌数月间，先生手撰奏折都六十三首，一代变法之大略在焉，亦有代作者。戊戌抄没，多所散佚，即篇目亦不能忆。而本集所辑《康有为戊戌年变法奏议考订》，胪列竟有六十六篇之多，较麦仲华所说多三篇。这六十六篇中有哪些是康有为所撰？有哪些是他人捉刀？其中哪些或有张冠李戴之嫌？这些问题也可能无关宏旨，但若能一一探索清楚，对还原戊戌变法运动的“真迹”，也是有作用的。
