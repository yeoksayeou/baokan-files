Hu Qili, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat, met with a delegation from the Tokyo YMCA led by Chairman Abumi Yoshimi and Honorary Chairman Okuyama Tadashi in Zhongnanhai this morning.

Hu Qili highly praised the Tokyo YMCA for its long-term efforts in promoting friendship between Chinese and Japanese youth and for its contributions to Chinese youth studying in Japan. He said that many Chinese trainees who studied in Japan have become key figures in their enterprises after returning home. They not only learned technology but, more importantly, they understood the situations in both China and Japan, becoming seeds for the further development of Sino-Japanese friendship.

Hu Qili said that the Tokyo YMCA's consistent efforts for Sino-Japanese friendship are in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples and youth of both China and Japan.

The delegation is in Beijing to participate in the third Sino-Japanese Youth Enterprise Management Seminar, which opened yesterday and is jointly organized by the All-China Youth Federation, the Chinese Young Entrepreneurs Association, and the Tokyo YMCA.
