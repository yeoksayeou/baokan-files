Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 30th. Reporter Yang Zhenwu reports: On March 29th, Yu Quefeng, Governor of Hebei Province, who is currently in Beijing attending the National People's Congress, commented on two critical reports from two newspapers.

A letter to the editor published in today's *People's Daily*, titled "Planned Materials Not Implemented, Yan Mountain Drip Irrigation Has Stopped Production," criticized certain departments for not supplying raw materials for state-approved agricultural water-saving equipment on time and in the required quantities. Yu Quefeng commented: "The materials used for drip irrigation equipment are not extensive. Despite current material difficulties, support must be provided. Please have the Provincial Planning Commission and Tangshan City immediately resolve the required raw materials. Regarding the materials confirmed for last year, were they not fully supplied or were they intercepted in the middle? Please investigate and clarify this as well."

Yu Quefeng told the reporter that issues like these are often things that leaders like us do not hear about or see when we go down to the grassroots. Newspapers and radio stations publicize these issues, not only promoting the resolution of problems but also helping us overcome bureaucratism. They have indeed been of great help to us.

This governor also said that for news and public opinion supervision, if the criticism is factual, it should be seriously investigated and handled; for those reports where the content is basically accurate but some details are incorrect, the focus should be on clarifying the main issues, and while seriously investigating and handling them, do not get bogged down in minor details; even if some critical reports are not entirely accurate, it is required that, under the premise of clarifying the matter, explanations should be made to the relevant departments on the one hand, and on the other hand, lessons should be learned to prevent similar problems from occurring.

Yu Quefeng said that our work needs supervision from all sides, and public opinion supervision is particularly important. We should give strong support and protection to this supervision. Although we hope that journalists will make the facts as accurate as possible and the criticism more correct when publishing critical reports, 100% accuracy is impossible. We make mistakes in our work, so how can we demand that critical reports have no errors? We should look at the main points of critical reports and not be overly critical of every small detail.

### 河北省长岳岐峰谈支持舆论监督  对批评报道不能求全责备

　　河北省长岳岐峰谈支持舆论监督        
    对批评报道不能求全责备
    本报北京３月３０日讯  记者杨振武报道：３月２９日，正在此间参加全国人代会的河北省长岳岐峰，就两家报纸的两篇批评报道发表了意见。
    刊登在这天《人民日报》上的读者来信《计划材料不落实，燕山滴灌已停产》，批评了一些部门对国家定型的支农节水先进设备不按时按量供应原材料问题。岳岐峰对此批示：“滴灌设备所用材料不多，当前材料再困难，也要给予支持。请省计委和唐山市立即解决所需原材料。对去年确定给的材料，是没有给够还是中间截留了？也望查清。”
    岳岐峰对记者说，类似这样的问题，多是我们这些领导干部平时听不到，下去看不到的。报纸、电台把它公之于众，不但可以促使问题的解决，而且有助于我们克服官僚主义，实在帮了我们的大忙。
    这位省长还说，对新闻舆论监督，凡是批评属实的，就认真查处；对那些内容基本属实，情节有些出入的批评报道，着眼于弄清主要问题，在认真查处的同时不纠缠细节；即使有些批评报道不完全属实，也要求在把事情搞清楚的前提下，一方面向有关部门作出解释，一方面举一反三，防止类似问题的发生。
    岳岐峰说，我们的工作需要各方面的监督，舆论监督尤不可少。对这个监督，我们应当给予大力支持和保护。尽管我们希望新闻界的同志在发表批评报道时，尽量把事实搞得准确一些，批评得更正确些，但百分之百的准确也是不可能的。我们干工作还有出错的时候，怎能苛求批评报道不出一点差错？对批评报道要看主流，不能求全责备。
