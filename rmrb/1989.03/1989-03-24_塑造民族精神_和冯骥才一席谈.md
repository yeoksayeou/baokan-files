Just as his 1.90-meter height is eye-catching, Feng Jicai's remarks on building national spirit attracted the attention of everyone present. After the press conference, the reporter visited this writer, who is known for his quick thinking and passionate nature.

Reporter: Why did you raise the issue of spiritual construction at this crucial juncture of economic reform?

Feng: China is currently in a painful historical transition period. It needs a strong spiritual pillar to support people through this process. For a long time, a simple, imposed ideology has replaced people's hearts. As the country opens its doors, people's hearts also open, but without something solid to fill them, mental confusion arises. Therefore, the central authorities propose to pursue both material and spiritual civilizations simultaneously, which is wise. People need beliefs, and a nation needs cohesion. We won the eight-year War of Resistance and endured the three years of "natural disasters" thanks to a spiritual force. The state should, like economic construction, have concrete plans for national spirit construction, formulate plans, and implement them step by step.

Reporter: It seems like this is a massive systematic project. After the First World War, the West also experienced what Nietzsche called the "death of God" period. Did they undertake such a project?

Feng: No, they did not. Because the West, based on its history of religion and individualism, people have their own inner spirits. In China, the masses have had only the thoughts of rulers for thousands of years, not their own souls. Now, we are building socialist spiritual civilization, so we must study people's mental states and build their souls. This is not something that the usual political and ideological work can solve. Just having some stage-specific slogans and short-term behaviors will not be enough to cultivate a spirit and truly inspire people. Recently, I proposed to Comrade Yan Mingfu that a team including history, psychology, sociology, aesthetics, philosophy, and cultural studies should be established to specifically study this issue, propose plans, and provide options for relevant departments to choose and implement. Yan Mingfu agreed with my opinion and hopes that our democratic parties can do some work in this regard.

　　塑造民族精神        
    ——和冯骥才一席谈
    本报记者  向兵
    就像他一米九○的个子引人注目一样，冯骥才一番建设民族精神的发言，吸引了所有在场的人。记者会后拜访了这位思维敏捷、富于激情的作家。
    记者：你为何在经济改革节骨眼上提出精神建设问题？
    冯：中国正处在痛苦的历史嬗变时期，它需要有强大的精神支柱来支撑人们走过这一历程。长期以来，一种外加的简单的思想，封闭、代替了人的心灵。在国门打开的同时，人们的心灵也打开了，然而没有坚实的东西去填充它们，于是便出现了心灵紊乱的现象。所以中央提出两个文明建设一起抓，这是明智的。人要有信念，民族要有凝聚力。我们赢得八年抗战，闯过三年“自然灾害”，靠的就是一种精神力量。国家应像抓经济建设那样，对民族精神建设也有切实的构想，制定出规划，一步一步抓。
    记者：看来这是个庞大的系统工程。第一次大战后，西方也出现过尼采所说的“上帝死了”的时期，他们搞过这种工程吗？
    冯：没有。因为西方在宗教和崇尚个性的历史基础上，人们有自己的内心精神。而中国大众几千年来只有统治者的思想，没有自己的心灵。我们现在要搞的是社会主义精神文明建设，就得研究人的心态，建设人的心灵。这不是常说的政治思想工作所能解决的。光有一些阶段性的口号、短期行为，想塑造一种精神、真正振奋人心，是不行的。前些日子，我向阎明复同志提议，应建立包括历史学、心理学、社会学、美学、哲学、文化学在内的班子，专门研究这个问题，提出方案，供有关部门选择、实施。阎明复赞成我的意见，希望我们民主党派在这方面做些工作。
