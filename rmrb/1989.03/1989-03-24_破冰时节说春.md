Title: Speaking of Spring During the Ice-Breaking Season

The spring in Sichuan comes quietly. There are no rivers breaking ice, no plains melting snow, and no eaves dripping with icicles. Instead, the thick clouds gradually thin out, and the revived sunlight often breaks through the clouds. The remaining winter clouds occasionally bring a drizzle. The weather is unpredictable, with sudden warmth followed by lingering cold, and frequent clouds and fog. This is the characteristic of spring in the basin, which is often cloudy and misty.

The phrase "A sudden spring breeze blows, and thousands of trees burst into blossom like pear flowers" is just a poetic description of the snow in winter. Perhaps because of the long duration of winter, writers and poets always idealize spring: swallows flying, grass growing, clear rivers and blue skies, red flowers and green willows, all filled with warmth.

Is the transition from winter to spring really as dramatic as a sudden change in the world overnight? It is not so simple. Everything that comes too easily does not reveal the true charm of spring. Imagine, after a long, harsh winter, reviving the frozen world and giving life back to all things—what a monumental task! What a great transformation!

I remember seeing the spring during the ice-breaking season on the Yellow River...

A vast plateau, winter hurriedly retreats, leaving patches of white snow on the shaded slopes and river valleys. The exposed yellow earth has not yet been touched by green. The wind is still biting, but the ice on the Yellow River has cracked, revealing a riverbed filled with broken ice and muddy yellow water.

Boats watch from the shore.

The sunlight seems too weak for the Yellow River.

I feel the struggle and pain of the Yellow River. There is no sound of waves, only the crashing of ice floes and the cracking of ice blocks. Under the ice, the water flows silently, carrying the heavy burden left by winter, flowing quietly...

I stand on the shore, filled with a sense of respect that I cannot suppress.

Spring awakens this great river, but the journey from the winter's grip to the surging flow is not completed by a gentle spring breeze or the calls of geese. The surging river must endure the immense pain of the ice-breaking period and carry away the heavy ice blocks left by winter with its own struggle and flow.

This is the revival of the river's life in spring—liberating itself through change.

Perhaps this is the true meaning of spring—

The old order of ice blocks is destroyed, the ice blocks that refuse to leave and the river water yearning for the sea struggle against each other. Ice blocks collide and press against each other, muddy water forces the ice blocks to break and shift, and in the chaos, the struggling water gathers strength. The ice blocks, in their transformation, defend their territory. Everything proceeds slowly but firmly, sometimes moving, sometimes stopping. Gradually, the water becomes turbulent and powerful, and gradually, the ice blocks are shattered, swallowed, and carried away...

I believe this is the best explanation of spring. Spring is a change, a vibrant force replacing the rigid and stagnant power. In this struggle and competition, the process of change is full of chaos, displacement, collision, struggle, resistance, aggregation, and collapse... a slow and painful process of development and transformation.

Ice three feet thick is not formed in one day of cold, and the vast expanse of ice and snow in winter cannot be changed by a few gentle spring breezes. The magnificent sight of the river breaking ice gives me an enlightenment.

Spring is beautiful, it brings hope and a future to all life. However, whether it is a great river breaking free from the ice layer or a seedling breaking through a hard shell, are they not accompanied by the pain of breaking?

So, when our ancient nation once again welcomes its own spring, and when unprecedented reforms are taking place on this land, facing the "ice-breaking season" with its collisions, contradictions, pains, and chaos of transformation, can we retreat? Can we curse the spring?

Since sunlight belongs to everyone, who can refuse the arrival of spring?

It is better to have less of the overly romanticized spring described by writers and poets, because we inevitably have to walk through the muddy paths of spring, with its sudden warmth and lingering cold, unpredictable weather, and storms...

　　破冰时节说春
    叶延滨
    四川的春是悄悄来的。没有江河破冰，没有原野融雪，更没有挂满冰凌柱的屋檐滴哒滴哒落下水珠的诗意。只是常常密布的浓厚云层渐渐稀疏，恢复了生机的阳光常拨开云隙，而那些尚未消褪的冬云又不时飘洒淅沥冷雨。乍暖还寒，阴晴无信，这是多云多雾的盆地春季的特色。
    忽如一夜春风来，千树万树梨花开，这只是诗人的春意，难怪诗人用此来形容严冬的雪景；大概因为对冬的一种恨其漫长的心情，文人墨客总把春尽量美化：莺飞草长，江碧天净，花红柳绿，其情融融。
    从冬到春果真是一夜间天地焕然一新，如此潇洒浪漫么？
    其实不然。一切得之太易，反而不解春的可爱之处。试想，从漫长的严冬中让冰封的世界复苏，让万物重新获得生机，这该是多么艰巨的“工程”——多么巨大的变革啊！
    我想起曾经在黄河滩上看到的破冰时节的春……
    一片苍茫的高原，严冬匆匆撤退，在阴坡和河谷还残留着皑皑白雪。重新露面的黄土上还没有绿色的点染，风依旧刺脸，只是黄河上的坚冰已经崩裂，在我们眼前展现一条遍体创伤、杂乱无序、布满冰块和浊黄水流的河床。
    船在岸上观望。
    阳光对于黄河也显得太柔弱。
    我感到黄河的挣扎与痛苦。没有涛声，只有冰排撞击的轰响，只有冰块迸裂的声音，而在冰块下的水流沉默地缓缓负载着严冬留下的沉重负担，静静地流……
    我站在岸上，内心产生一种难以抑制的敬意。
    春天唤醒了这条大河，然而从严冬的禁锢走向奔腾，不是一阵春风几声雁啼就可以完成的。涌动的河流之躯要承担巨大的破冰期的阵痛，承担冬天留下的重负，要用它自己的挣扎和流淌之力把这些残存的巨大冰排冰块带走。
    这就是江河的生命在春天的复苏——在变革中解放自己。
    也许这就是真正的春意——
    旧有的冰块封固的秩序被破坏了，不肯离去的冰块和向往大海的河水互相角逐，冰块撞击彼此倾压，混浊的流水迫使冰块断裂错位，混乱中挣扎的水流聚集力量，蜕变中相互靠拢的冰块据守着地盘，一切在缓慢而坚定地进行，时动时停，渐渐地流水显得湍急有力，渐渐地冰块被撞碎被吞没被带向远方……
    我认为这是春的最好注释。春乃一种变革，一种生机勃勃的力量代替僵化禁锢的力量。在这种力量的角逐、较量之中，变革的过程就是充满了混乱，错位，冲撞，挣扎，对抗，聚合，崩裂……这样一个痛苦的缓慢发展的蜕变进程。
    冰冻三尺非一日之寒，千里冰封万里雪飘的严冬格局要得到改变，也不是几缕柳条中的春风就可以实现的，大河破冰期的壮观给我以启示。
    春天是美好的，它给一切生命以希望和未来。然而，大至江河挣脱冰层的禁锢，小至种籽顶破坚实的果壳，不都伴随着破裂的痛苦吗？
    那么当我们这个古老的民族又一次迎来自己的春天，在这片土地上进行着前所未有的改革事业的时候，面对“破冰时节”那些冲撞，矛盾，痛苦和蜕变中的混乱和丑恶，我们能够退回去吗？我们难道可以诅咒春天么？
    既然阳光谁也不能垄断，那么春天的到来谁又能拒绝呢？
    只是那种被文人墨客过于浪漫化的春意还是少一点好，因为我们不可避免地要在乍暖还寒，阴晴无信，风雨交加之中走过春天泥泞的道路……
