On March 23, the Tianjin delegation discussed the government work report, focusing on finding effective measures for rectification, order, and deepening reforms.

Han Enjia (Advisor to the Municipal Government): The policies for rectification and order are correct, and the initial results are fragile. This round of rectification and order is essentially a new adjustment, different from the adjustments in the 1960s and the previous two, as it occurs during the transition from the old to the new system. The political, ideological, and economic foundations are vastly different, so we must timely study new situations and problems and adopt new strategies. Many issues are difficult to resolve with current methods.

Li Ruihuan (Mayor of Tianjin): The loan interest rates, especially for long-term loans, are as high as 25% annually. The average profit rate for light and heavy industries is only around 10%. With such high interest rates, there are only two options: raising prices or going bankrupt, which would cause financial problems. In Tianjin, the textile and cotton industries are 100% in the red, and this industry is a pillar of Tianjin!

Qing Qifu (General Manager of Tianjin Bicycle Factory): Just the price increases for steel and nickel have cost the Tianjin bicycle industry billions over the past year. The ripple effect means the processing industry can't absorb such costs, so they have to pass them on to consumers. Therefore, we hope the maximum price limit will be announced soon.

Li Ruihuan: Fixed assets can be controlled, including those outside the plan, which can be phased out first. The problem lies in the consumer funds, where some people earn tens or hundreds of millions, and we don't know how they do it. It's like underground seepage where you can't find the leak. We need to consult more doctors, and we representatives are the doctors. We need to diagnose and treat the illness comprehensively, regulating the spleen, stomach, and liver, rather than using simple treatments. We need to study the condition comprehensively, find the symptoms, and then prescribe and brew the medicine. Now, people just take the medicine as soon as they get it, treating one symptom but causing another. We need to consult more experts, examine, inquire, and diagnose properly. Just prescribing medicine without proper diagnosis is too dangerous! (Interjection: If it doesn't heal, taking more medicine won't help either.) (Laughter)

Hu Qili: Now, rectification and deepening reforms have reached this stage. The method of isolated efforts or treating symptoms individually is not effective. We must coordinate, synchronize, and gradually implement comprehensive measures. To make progress in this area, we need scientific and democratic decision-making. Complex problems cannot be solved by a single leader or a few wise decisions. It's not the era where a few phrases or a few characters can solve China's problems. Everyone is anxious, concerned for the country and the people, and proposes many plans. Some solutions are too simple: Will privatization solve all problems? Will a multi-party system solve everything? Problems are not that simple.

Tianjin has done relatively well in recent years, and the people are generally satisfied. The reason is that the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government pay attention to democratic and scientific decision-making, treating issues that the people care about as the focus of decision-making, and using the people's emotions as the first signal for decision-making. To overcome temporary difficulties and move forward, we must rely on collective wisdom and cannot use simple prescriptions. Everyone has different roles, but we are all performing in the play of China's reform and opening up. We cannot mess it up!

Li Ruihuan: We often use a single word to summarize complex social phenomena, such as hot, cold, left, or right. To say everything is overheated and needs to be cooled down with an air conditioner, is that feasible? We need to analyze! Is grain hot or cold? Is cotton hot or cold? I think talking about imbalance is more appropriate. We must affirm the achievements of the reform; without affirmation, we cannot boost morale. We must adhere to the direction of the reform; without adherence, China has no way out. We must acknowledge the problems that have arisen during the reform; without acknowledgment and scientific analysis, we cannot solve them well. We must summarize the experiences (both positive and negative) of the reform process; without summarization, we cannot truly improve our level. I want to emphasize that to get through the difficulties, we must rely on the people. The people are the practitioners, the masters of the state. Mayors and governors are elected by everyone; you are servants and should listen to the masters. Firmly believe that relying on the people is the fundamental prescription for doing a good job and overcoming difficulties. The principle of "the boat that carries you can also capsize you" should be well considered.

Liu Hangying (Female, Writer): I hope that the dialogue between ministers and representatives can become a regular practice, timely listening to opinions and suggestions. Hu Qili is in charge of ideology, and I hope the issue of social public morality can be put on the agenda. There is a saying, "In these days, who is afraid of whom?" Now it has changed to, "In these days, who doesn't cheat whom?" (Laughter) I feel that morality has deteriorated to this extent, and if we don't rectify it, how can it work? We should also put news supervision on the agenda. Our reporters are still too weak. Last year, the National People's Congress was a bit more active, but this year, under the current situation, it seems to have tightened up again. I, along with Zi Long and Ji Cai, suggested to Hu Qili that central leaders should make timely television speeches. We need to improve political transparency. If there are problems, we should directly tell the people, don't pretend to be profound. How can the people not complain if they are not informed?

### 为治理整顿寻良方——天津代表团讨论实录

　　为治理整顿寻良方        
    ——天津代表团讨论实录
    本报记者  高新庆
    ３月２３日，天津代表团审议政府工作报告，议论的中心集中在如何为治理、整顿、深化改革寻找良方上。
    韩恩甲（市府顾问）：治理整顿的方针政策是正确的，取得的成效是初步的，还很脆弱。这次治理整顿，实质上是一次新的调整，和６０年代以及前两次调整有很大的不同，是在新旧体制转换时期进行，政治、思想、经济基础都大不一样，必须及时地研究出现的新情况新问题，采取新的对策。按目前的一些办法，难题很多。
    李瑞环（天津市市长）：贷款利率，特别是长期贷款各种利率高达年利２５％，轻重工业平均利润率只１０％多一点，这样高的利率，谁也没办法，出路只有两条，一个是涨价，一个是亏损破产，这样财政就成问题。天津纺织、棉纺１００％亏损，这行业是天津一个支柱呀！
    邢起富（天津自行车厂厂长）：光钢材、镍两项原材料涨价，天津自行车行业一年多支出几个亿，连锁反应，加工业没这么大消化能力，只得转嫁到消费者身上。所以我们盼最高限价早日出台。
    李瑞环：固定资产容易压，包括计划外的可以先死后活。问题是消费基金这一块，有挣几十、几百万的，不知什么法子弄的，像地下渗水找不到渗漏的地方。要多找大夫会诊，咱们代表就是大夫，要按中医辨证论治研究药方，调脾、调胃、调肝，不能采取简单疗法。要综合研究病情，找出病症，再抓药、熬药。现在拿到药就治，治好嗓子眼，那里又拉稀，治好了拉稀又出个什么病（一片笑声）。要会诊嘛，要多找点人望闻问切嘛，一不问二不切就抓药，太危险！（插话：久治不愈，再吃药更不管用了）（一片笑声）
    胡启立：现在治理整顿、深化改革已经到了这样的程度，孤军深入，或者像大家说的头疼医头、脚疼医脚的办法是不行的，必须协调、同步、渐进、配套。要在这方面有所前进，必须有科学决策，民主决策。复杂的问题，不是某一个领导人或某一个英明领导一概括，作一个决断，八句话四个字（众人哈哈大笑），或多少句话，十六个字就把中国治了，这个不行，已经不是那个时代。大家很着急，忧国忧民，提出很多方案，有的处方简单：私有化把问题都解决了？多党制就解决了？问题能那么简单？
    天津这几年工作做得较好，群众比较满意，原因是天津市委、市政府注意决策民主化、科学化，把群众关心的热点当作决策的重点，把群众的情绪作为决策的第一信号。要克服暂时的困难，再前进一步，必须群策群力，不能简单处方，要大家摸脉、分析。大家角色不同，但同演中国改革开放这台戏，不能演砸了！
    李瑞环：我们总是好用一个词来概括复杂的社会现象，比如说热啦冷啦，“左”啦右啦。要说都是过热，都放电冰箱冰一冰行不行？要分析嘛！粮食是热还是冷？棉花是热还是冷？我说讲失衡比较恰当。对改革的成绩必须肯定，不肯定就不能振奋精神；对改革的方向必须坚持，不坚持中国就没有出路；改革过程中发生的问题必须承认，不承认，不进行科学的分析，就不能较好地解决；改革过程中的经验（包括正反两方面）必须总结，不总结就不能真正提高水平。我想强调的是要度过难关，必须依靠群众。群众是实践的主体，群众是国家的主人，市长、省长是大家选的嘛，你是仆人，还不应该听听主人的。坚定地相信依靠群众是我们办好事业、克服困难最基本的处方，载舟覆舟的道理要好好琢磨琢磨。
    刘航鹰（女，作家）：希望部长与代表对话能够成为一种制度，及时听取意见、建议。启立同志是抓意识形态的，希望把社会公德问题提到议事日程上来抓。有句俏皮话，前几年叫“这年头谁怕谁”，现在改了，叫“这年头谁不坑骗谁”（众笑！）我觉得人心日下到这一步了，不治理一下哪行？还应该把新闻监督提到日程上来。我们的记者还很软弱，去年人大稍微活跃了一阵子，在今年形势下，好像又紧了。我和子龙、骥才曾向启立同志建议，中央领导同志及时发表电视演说。要提高政治透明度，有什么问题可以直接向老百姓讲嘛，不要在那里故作高深状，群众不知情，怎么不埋怨？
