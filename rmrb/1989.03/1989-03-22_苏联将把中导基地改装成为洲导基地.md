The first deputy director of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Press Department, Perfiliev, announced on the 20th that the Soviet Union has begun converting some of the SS-20 medium-range missile bases that are to be destroyed into SS-25 intercontinental ballistic missile bases.

He said that the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by the Soviet Union and the United States on December 8, 1987, stipulates that both sides have the right to use these medium-range missile bases as land-based ballistic missile or cruise missile bases. The Soviet Union is strictly following the provisions of the treaty in doing so. He also said that the Soviet Union has informed the United States in advance of its intention to carry out such conversions.

　　苏联将把中导基地改装成为洲导基地
    苏联外交部新闻局第一副局长佩尔菲利耶夫２０日宣布，苏联已开始把要销毁的ＳＳ—２０中程导弹的一些基地改装成ＳＳ—２５洲际弹道导弹基地。
    他说，１９８７年１２月８日苏美签署的中导条约规定，双方有权将这种中程导弹基地用作陆基弹道导弹或巡航导弹基地，苏联是严格按照条约的规定这样做的。他还说，苏联已将要进行这种改装的打算事先通知了美国。
