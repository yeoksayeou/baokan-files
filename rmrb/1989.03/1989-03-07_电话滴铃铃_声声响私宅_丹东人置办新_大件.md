	The sound of the telephone rings in private homes
	Dan Dong residents purchase new "big items"

	Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 6 - (Reporter Chen Guangming) In Dan Dong City, Liaoning Province, installing a residential telephone has become an important part of people's home furnishings and purchasing of "big items."

	For many years, Dan Dong City has lagged behind in transportation and telecommunications, earning it the nickname "dead-end street" from outsiders. However, the reforms and opening up have brought new vitality to Dan Dong. The city has introduced and installed a 10,000-line programmable control telephone system, significantly improving its domestic and international communication conditions. At the same time, the mindset of Dan Dong residents is also changing. In the past, people would save money to buy color TVs, refrigerators, and combination cabinets, but no one was interested in installing a telephone. Now, they consider installing a telephone as an important "big item" to purchase.

	A certain cadre saved money for several years to buy a color TV, a stereo, and a washing machine. Last year, she spent 1,200 yuan to install a telephone herself. She said, "Buying a refrigerator can be delayed, but installing a telephone cannot be postponed. In modern society, the pace of work and life has accelerated, and there is less time to visit relatives and friends or handle affairs. Using a telephone to communicate information is quick, timely, convenient, and saves a lot of time." Dan Dong City installed 2,501 telephones last year, breaking the record for the number of installations since the founding of the nation. Among them, 1,800 were private telephones. In January of this year, 348 telephones were installed, more than half of which were private telephones.

	It is understood that the main people installing private telephones in Dan Dong City are enterprise contractors or lessees, individual business owners, specialized householders, lawyers, journalists, and cadres from municipal agencies. In addition, there are some retired cadres and workers engaged in second jobs. This Spring Festival, the tradition of visiting relatives and friends in person, which has been formed over many years, has been diluted due to the rapid increase in private telephones. Using the telephone to greet the New Year has become a trend in Dan Dong.

### 电话滴铃铃　声声响私宅  丹东人置办新“大件”

　　电话滴铃铃　声声响私宅
    丹东人置办新“大件”
    新华社沈阳三月六日电  （记者陈光明）在辽宁省丹东市，安装住宅电话已经成为人们设计家庭摆设和购置“大件”的一项重要内容。
    丹东市多年来由于交通电讯事业发展较慢，外地人称这里是“死胡同”。近年来的改革开放给丹东带来活力。这里引进安装了万门程控电话设施，同国内外的通讯条件有了明显改善。与此同时，丹东人的观念也在变。过去人们有钱只想买彩电、冰箱、组合柜等“大件”，对装电话无人问津。而现在，则把装电话作为重要“大件”来置办。
    一位机关干部积攒了几年钱，先后购买了彩电、收录机、洗衣机，去年又自己花费一千二百元安装了电话。她说：“冰箱可以延迟购买，电话不可不装。现代社会，工作和生活的节奏都加快了，没有更多时间去访亲寻友联系事务。用电话沟通信息，既迅速及时便利，又节省大量时间。”丹东市去年共装电话二千五百零一台，突破了建国以来历年装机量。其中私人电话占一千八百台。今年一月又装了三百四十八部电话，一多半是私人电话。
    经了解，丹东市安装私人电话的主要是企业承包人或租赁者、个体户、专业户，从事律师、记者等职业的人和市直机关干部。此外，还有一些离退休干部和搞第二职业的工人。今年春节，多年来形成的登门拜年传统因私人电话迅速增加而被冲淡了，用电话拜年在丹东已蔚然成风。
