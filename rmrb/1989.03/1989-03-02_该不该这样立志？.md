Title: Should One Set Such Ambitions?

I saw a report praising the ambition of a factory director from a remote province. This director said: "I just don't believe that a province with several thousand people would only watch television sets produced in other provinces." Later, his ambitious goal was indeed realized. People in his province started watching locally produced color televisions, and the quality was also quite good. There is no doubt that this factory director's achievements deserve praise. The spirit of not being content with falling behind is also commendable. However, if we promote it as a guiding ideology for economic development, we need to analyze it carefully.

Indeed, there was a time when we promoted such ambitions: if others can do it, I can do it too; if others have it, I want it too. From the perspective of "contending for honor," this is very valuable. However, in the context of modern commodity economics, it is not necessarily advisable to do this without analysis.

Take color televisions as an example. It is said that there are already more than 100 color television production lines nationwide. Last year, in the national color television quality competition, 47-inch (18-inch) color televisions that won the first prize had 58 different brands. The national color television production last year reached 10.27 million units, although it did not reach the world's top, but in terms of the number of brands, China can be said to be the world's most.

In this "most," there is a serious problem of repeated introductions and repeated constructions. "Color televisions everywhere," "electricity everywhere," the result is scattered production points, huge investments, and the inability to form the scale benefits of specialized large-scale production, leading to a waste of productive forces. South Korea's Samsung company alone produces 2.5 million television sets a year, equivalent to the production of dozens of factories in our country, not to mention the large companies like Philips of the Netherlands, Sony, and Panasonic of Japan. Why do we have so many manufacturers, and the production of color televisions still cannot meet the market demand? One of the reasons is that having many manufacturers does not form an overall advantage.

In the context of modern commodity economics, not only a province, but even a country, cannot have everything. There must be mutual exchange. Any country cannot be self-sufficient without participating in the world market. Our country is vast, with each province and region having its own advantages. There is no need for one to have something, and the other to also have it; one to do something, and the other to also do it. Commodity economics is an exchange economy. Without mutual exchange, what is commodity economics?

Long-term natural economics have formed the small production idea of not seeking help from others in everything. Currently, the fiscal stove system, the segmented market, the chaotic circulation order, and the tight supply of commodities have further exacerbated this idea. Therefore, during the rectification and adjustment process, it is also very important to change this idea.

    该不该这样立志？
    皮子
    我看到一个材料，内容是表扬一位偏远省份厂长的志气。这位厂长说：“我就不相信几千万人的省总看外省生产的电视机。”后来，他的雄心壮志果然实现了，本省的人果然看上了本省的彩色电视机，而且质量也不错。没有疑问，这位厂长的事迹是应该表扬的。不甘落后的精神也是值得肯定的。但是，如果把它作为发展经济的指导思想来加以宣扬，却需要加以分析。
    不错，有一个时期我们宣传过这样的志气：别人能干的我也能干，别人有的我也要有。从“争气”的角度看十分可贵，但在现代商品经济条件下，不加分析地都这样做，并不见得可取。
    就以彩电为例，据说，目前全国已有彩电生产线100多条。去年，全国彩色电视机质量评比，获得一等奖的47厘米（18英寸）彩电就有58个牌号。全国彩电产量去年已达到1027万台，虽然还够不上世界第一，但论彩电的牌号之多，中国可谓世界之最。
    这个“之最”中，就包含着严重的重复引进、重复建设。“遍地挂彩”，“到处带电”，结果是分散布点，耗资巨大，形不成专业化大生产的规模效益，造成生产力的浪费。南朝鲜一个三星公司就年产电视机250万台，等于我国十几个、二十几个工厂的产量，更不要说荷兰的“菲利浦”、日本的“松下”、“索尼”等大公司了。为什么我们有这么多的厂家，彩电生产还远远满足不了市场需要？厂家多，形不成整体优势，就是原因之一。
    在现代商品经济条件下，不要说一个省，就是一个国家，也不能应有尽有，总要互通有无。任何国家也不能脱离世界市场而自给自足。我们国家幅员广阔，省与省之间，地区与地区之间，各有各的优势，大可不必你有什么，我也要有什么，你上什么，我也上什么。商品经济就是交换经济。没有互通有无，还有什么商品经济！
    长期的自然经济，使人们形成了万事不求人的小生产观念。当前，财政分灶的体制，互相分割的市场，混乱的流通秩序，紧缺的商品供应，又助长了这种观念。因此，在治理整顿过程中，扭转这种观念，亦是相当重要的。
