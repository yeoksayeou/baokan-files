A Song No Longer Ancient

By Zhou Da Yi, People's Daily Reporter

“Ba—dang! Clang! Ba—dang! Clang!…”

An ancient and monotonous song resonates from the primitive wooden loom, echoing through the gray-yellow wooden houses of the Water ethnic minority village. Year after year, it endures without fading.

The handwoven cloth is less than a meter wide, as thick as copper coins, with an indigo blue base and small white flowers woven throughout. From the hands of Water ethnic minority women, it slowly extends from one end of the loom to the other, steadily and persistently.

In Water ethnic minority families, handwoven cloth is clothing, bedding, the warmth of the home, and also the pride of Water ethnic minority women. For these women, the ability to weave handwoven cloth is a measure of skill and a mark of talent. A cadre from the township enterprise bureau in the only Water ethnic minority autonomous county in the country—Guizhou Province’s Sandu Water ethnic minority autonomous county—told me: “If a Water ethnic minority woman can make the whole family wear clothes made from her own handwoven cloth during festivals, she is considered very capable and will be praised. If she buys fabric from the market to make clothes, she will be laughed at by everyone.”

The market economy first acknowledges the value of human labor. When the tide of reform finally reached the Water ethnic minority region, the narrow space of wooden structures was broken through, hearts filled with love and honor were opened, and the traditional concept of weaving with indigo and small white flowers faded. The value of Water ethnic minority women’s labor, long buried, was finally discovered. Handwoven cloth flowed from the ancient loom to the market and overseas.

The deputy director of the Economic Commission of Sandu County, Jiang Xiangqin, provided the following information: Now, every year, handwoven cloth woven by Water ethnic minority families is exported, reaching 120,000 meters annually, with over 200 varieties, mainly exported to Japan, earning 120,000 US dollars in foreign exchange.

In Shuidong Township’s Shuimeng Village, in a wooden house with a television antenna sticking out of the window, the hostess, Pan Shuixian, laid out roll after roll of woven handwoven cloth in front of me for me to admire. As I stroked these pieces of cloth, soaked with the sweat and toil of a Water ethnic minority woman’s countless days and nights, I asked her, “Are these for sale?” “Yes!” she proudly told me, “In 1988, I sold four or five rolls.” She smiled, her voice light and cheerful, revealing a fresh idea—that the warmth of the family and the praise of neighbors are no longer the true reflection of her labor’s value. Water ethnic minority women now take pride in being able to enter the market. Pan Shuixian expressed this great change in their mindset in very simple words. “In the past, I only thought about making clothes for the adults and children,” she said, pulling over the children clustered around her and pointing to the handwoven cloth clothes they were wearing, “This cloth is thick and durable. Now that I weave more cloth, other places also want to buy this cloth, so I sell it on the street. Other families are the same; if they weave too much, they sell it. Some families can sell over 10 rolls in a winter!” Pan Shuixian and the Water ethnic minority women around her all said that now they lack money, not food or clothing. They have already learned where to realize the value of their labor.

“How do you sell them?”

“A roll of 10 meters can be sold for over 20 yuan.” She earned over 100 yuan from selling handwoven cloth in 1988. She seemed quite satisfied.

In the county’s Tangzhou Township’s Zhonghua Village, a Water ethnic minority grandmother, dressed in a half-length jacket woven from her own handwoven cloth, laughed and said to me, “I am 58 years old, and I have been weaving cloth since I was 25. I have trained over 50 apprentices. In the past, life was hard, and to save money, we grew our own cotton and wove our own cloth to make clothes.” I asked, “Isn’t it troublesome to do everything yourself?” The old woman, full of experience, replied, “Weaving handwoven cloth is a lot of work!” She introduced: Water ethnic minority women, from spring to summer, from autumn to winter, grow cotton, pick cotton, and then have to go through drying, twisting, carding, rolling, spinning, dyeing, and finally weaving on the loom. When weaving, they also need to match different colored threads to weave various patterns, such as diagonal, circular, peppercorn, square, fishbone, and basket weave patterns…

Her introduction made one understand that in that ancient and monotonous loom sound, the hard work and sweat of Water ethnic minority women are condensed. The labor they put into their handwork is not less than producing a color television, but their products have not yet reflected the cost of their labor.

The simple Water ethnic minority women, most of whom have not been to school and are illiterate or semi-illiterate, hope to realize the value of their labor but do not understand the principle of the dual nature of labor. Therefore, they are mostly easy to satisfy and continue to follow the ancient method of working hard for every roll of handwoven cloth worth over 20 yuan.

However, a few clever Water ethnic minority women have already begun to emphasize efficiency, relying on modern industry to expand the creative domain of hand labor, and to get rid of labor that cannot reflect value. Pan Shuixian from Shuimeng Village told me, “Growing cotton requires land. With limited land, the cotton grown is not enough. Moreover, growing cotton and spinning yarn takes too much time. Now we buy factory yarn from the market to weave cloth.” The director of Sandu County’s Ethnic Textile Factory confirmed this new trend: “In recent years, the demand for yarn in our market has increased, and the yarn we produce is in short supply. In 1988, we sold over 100,000 kilograms of yarn, while in 1981, we only sold 27,000 kilograms of yarn.”

Water ethnic minority women free up the land used for growing cotton to grow oranges, soybeans, and chili peppers, and sell them in the market. Just the money from selling a kilogram of chili peppers can buy a kilogram of cotton yarn.

Although the price factor is a shadow over the development of the seemingly too cheap handwoven cloth, the important thing is that they have stepped out of the self-sufficient small world. They are already exploring new paths to better realize the value of their labor.

### 一支不再古老的歌

　　一支不再古老的歌
    本报记者  邹大毅
    “巴—嗒！哐哐！巴—嗒！哐哐！……”
    一首古老而单调的歌，从原始的木制织布机上重重地奏鸣出来，悠悠回荡在水族村寨灰黄色的木板楼房里。年复一年，经久不衰。
    土花布，宽不足一米，厚若铜钱，靛蓝底色，织满青白色的小花，从水族妇女带茧子的手下，一点一点地向织机的另一头延伸，缓慢而执著。
    在水族家庭里，土花布是衣服，是床垫，是家庭的温馨，也是水族妇女的骄傲。对水族妇女来说，能织土花布，是一种能力的尺度，才华的标志。在全国唯一的水族自治县——贵州省三都水族自治县，乡镇企业局一位干部告诉我：“一个水族妇女到了过节时，能让一家大小都穿上用自己织的土花布做的衣服，她就被人看作很能干，就能受到夸奖。如果到市场上去买布做衣服，就要被大家笑话。”
    市场经济首先承认的是人的劳动的价值。当改革的大潮终于涌到三都水族地区后，木板构筑的狭小空间被突破了，被爱心和荣耀填充的心灵已经敞开，用靛蓝和小白花编织的传统观念的光晕已经淡化，长期被掩埋着的水族妇女劳动的价值才被发掘出来，土花布才从古老的织机上流向市场，流向海外。
    三都县经委副主任蒋向芹提供了这样一个情况：现在，每年都有水族家织的土花布出口，一年可达１２万米，品种有２００多种，主要出口到日本，创汇１２万美元。
    在水冬乡水蒙村，一幢窗口里伸出电视接收天线的木板楼房里，女主人潘水仙捧出一匹匹织好的土花布，放在我面前，任我观赏。抚摸着这些浸润着一个水族妇女无数个日日夜夜辛勤劳作的土布，我问她：“这些布是要卖的吗？”“卖！”她自豪地告诉我，１９８８年她卖了四五匹了。街上卖布的人很多。她那笑容，那轻快的语调，透出一个清新的观念，那就是，家庭的温馨和邻里的赞誉已不再是自己劳动的价值的真正反映，水族妇女已经以能否走进市场为荣。潘水仙用很质朴的话道出了她们观念上的这一大转变。“过去只想给大人、娃娃做衣服穿”，她拉过簇拥在身边的几个孩子，指着他们身上的土花布衣服，“这种布厚实，耐穿。现在自己织的布多了，其他地方也有人要买这种布，就上街卖了。别人家也是这样，织多了，就要卖。有的人家一个冬天就可以卖１０多匹呢！”潘水仙和她周围的几个水族妇女都说，现在缺的不是吃穿，缺的是钱。她们已经懂得到什么地方去实现自己劳动的价值。
    “你们怎么卖法呢？”
    “一匹１０米，可以卖２０多元。”她１９８８年卖的土花布，收入１００多元。她似乎很满意。
    在这个县的塘州乡中化村，一位身穿自己织的土花布半长褂的水族老妈妈乐呵呵地对我说：“我５８岁了，从２５岁就开始织布，徒弟都带出了５０多个。以前生活苦，为了省钱，都是自己种棉花、织布做衣服。”我问：“什么都自己弄，麻烦不麻烦？”老人满有经验地回答说：“织土花布事情多哟！”她介绍说：水族妇女从春到夏，从秋到冬，种棉花，摘棉花，然后要经过晒、绞、弹、卷、纺、染，最后是上机器织。织的时候还要搭配不同颜色的纱，编织出各种各样的花纹来，有斜纹、回纹、花椒纹、方格纹、鱼骨纹、笆摺纹……
    她的介绍，使人领悟到了，在那古老而单调的机杼声中，凝结了水族妇女多少辛勤与心血，她们的手工付出的劳动消耗，并不比生产一台彩电少，然而她们的产品远未反映出她们付出的代价。
    质朴的水族妇女，大多没有上过学，处于文盲半文盲状态。她们希望实现自己劳动的价值，但却不会懂得劳动二重性的道理。所以，她们大多数易于满足，她们仍然依循着古老的方式为每一匹２０多元的土花布而操劳着。
    但是少数精明的水族妇女已经开始讲究效率，依靠现代工业来拓展手工劳动的创造领域，摆脱那些不能体现价值的劳动。水蒙村的潘水仙告诉我：“种棉花要用土地。土地少，种的棉花不够用。而且自己种棉花、纺纱太费时间。我们现在上街买工厂的纱来织布了。”三都县民族纺织厂厂长证实了这个新趋势：“这几年我们这里市场上对纱的需求量大了，我们生产的纱已经供不应求。１９８８年就卖掉１０多万公斤纱，而１９８１年只卖掉２．７万公斤纱。”
    水族妇女把种棉花的地省出来，种柑桔，种黄豆，种辣椒，到市场上卖。光是一斤辣椒卖得的钱，就可以买一斤棉纱。
    尽管物价的因素是水族妇女那显得太便宜了的土花布发展的阴影，但重要的是，她们已经迈出了那种自给自足的小天地，她们已经在探索更能实现自己劳动价值的新路子。
