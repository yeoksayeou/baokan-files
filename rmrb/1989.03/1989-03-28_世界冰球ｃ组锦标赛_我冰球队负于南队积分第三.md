World Ice Hockey C Group Championship
China's Ice Hockey Team Defeated by Yugoslavia, Ranks Third

Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, March 26 (Reporter Xǔ Yuánǎi) The Chinese ice hockey team today lost 1-8 to the European powerhouse Yugoslavia in the World Ice Hockey C Group Championship.

In today's match held at the Blacktown Ice Rink in the suburbs of Sydney, Yugoslavia's excellent defense and fast-paced offense dominated the game, putting China's team in a passive position throughout. China's team used a two-three defensive formation in the front court to intercept, but the players' speed and individual skills were clearly inferior to their opponents. The goal was breached multiple times. Yugoslavia scored three goals in each of the first and second periods. Liu Wenwu scored the only goal for China in the third period at the 7-minute mark. So far, China has played six matches, with a record of 3 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses, accumulating 7 points, temporarily ranking third behind Yugoslavia and the Netherlands.

    新华社悉尼３月２６日电  （记者许钺乃）中国冰球队今天在世界冰球Ｃ组锦标赛中，以１∶８负于欧洲劲旅南斯拉夫队。
    今天下午在悉尼市郊黑城冰球场进行的这场比赛中，南斯拉夫队以出色的防守和快速进攻，掌握了场上的主动权，使中国队一直处于被动局面。中国队今天在前场以二三联防打阻击，但队员的攻防速度和个人技术明显不如对方，球门多次被对方突破。南斯拉夫队在第１局和第２局比赛中各攻入３个球。中国队的刘文武在第３局７分钟时为中国队打入了唯一一球。至此，中国队已进行了６场比赛，成绩是６战３胜，１平，２负积７分，暂列南斯拉夫和荷兰队之后居第三位。
