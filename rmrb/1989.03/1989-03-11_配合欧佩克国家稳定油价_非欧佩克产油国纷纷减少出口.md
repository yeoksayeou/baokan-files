Title: Non-OPEC Oil-Producing Countries Reduce Exports to Stabilize Prices in Coordination with OPEC

	In coordination with OPEC countries to stabilize oil prices, several non-OPEC oil-producing countries have announced that they will reduce their oil exports by 5% each day during the second quarter of this year. The global oil market has responded positively, with oil prices showing a slight increase while remaining generally stable.

	Taking the New York oil market as an example, from March 1 to March 6, the April futures contract for U.S. standard crude oil—West Texas Intermediate—rose from $18.30 per barrel to $18.67 per barrel. The April futures contract for North Sea Brent crude oil increased from $17.25 per barrel to $18.15 per barrel, both exceeding the OPEC's target price of $18 per barrel.

	The decision by non-OPEC oil-producing countries to reduce their oil exports by 5% is in line with the principles agreed upon at the joint meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries held in London in late February. During the meeting, non-OPEC countries proposed that they would voluntarily reduce their oil exports based on their individual situations. Most of these countries will start reducing their daily oil exports by 5% from April 1, while a few countries, due to domestic circumstances, will temporarily freeze their oil export volumes. OPEC countries were not required to take reciprocal measures. The two sides quickly reached an agreement. This is the first time that OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries have coordinated efforts to stabilize oil prices. Some oil analysts here believe that while the reduction in oil supply by non-OPEC countries has more symbolic significance than practical impact, its importance lies in the fact that it marks a good beginning, indicating that non-OPEC oil-producing countries are serious about cooperating with OPEC countries.

	The second quarter of this year is approaching, a period when oil demand typically decreases. On March 6, the May futures contract for U.S. standard crude oil on the New York oil market was $18.09 per barrel, and the June futures contract was $17.72 per barrel. This indicates a weakening trend in the global oil market, necessitating continued coordination between OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries to jointly address the severe challenges.

### 配合欧佩克国家稳定油价  非欧佩克产油国纷纷减少出口

　　配合欧佩克国家稳定油价
    非欧佩克产油国纷纷减少出口
    本报纽约３月１０日电  记者刘开宸报道：几天来，一些非欧佩克产油国纷纷宣布在今年第二季度内每天减少原油出口５％，以帮助欧佩克国家稳定石油价格。世界石油市场立即有了积极反应，原油价格在基本平稳的情况下，略有上升。
    以纽约石油市场为例，从３月１日到６日，美国标准原油——西得克萨斯中质油的４月期货，从每桶１８．３０美元涨到１８．６７美元；北海布伦特原油的４月期货，从每桶１７．２５美元涨到１８．１５美元；都超过了欧佩克规定的每桶１８美元的“目标价”。
    非欧佩克产油国宣布减少原油出口５％，是执行今年２月下旬在伦敦召开的欧佩克和非欧佩克产油国联席会议上确定的原则。非欧佩克国家当时在会上提出，它们将根据各国情况自动减少原油出口。其中大多数国家将从４月１日起每天减少原油出口５％，个别国家因国内特殊情况，暂时冻结原油出口量。对欧佩克国家并未要求采取相等措施。双方很快达成了协议。这是欧佩克与非欧佩克产油国为稳定油价而进行的首次协调。这里的一些石油分析家认为，非欧佩克国家削减原油供应量，虽然象征意义大于实际作用，但其意义重大，因为这次协调是一个良好的开端，表明非欧佩克产油国要与欧佩克国家合作的态度是认真的。
    今年第二季度就要来临，是原油需求减少的淡季。３月６日纽约石油市场上，美国标准原油的５月期货，每桶为１８．０９美元，６月期货为１７．７２美元，这表明世界石油市场的趋势是疲软的，需要欧佩克与非欧佩克产油国继续协调，共同应付严峻的挑战。
