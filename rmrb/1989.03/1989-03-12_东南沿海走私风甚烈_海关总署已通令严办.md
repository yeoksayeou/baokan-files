The Customs General Administration spokesperson revealed today that smuggling along the southeast coast has been severe this year, with a significant increase in major cases involving smuggled cigarettes. The Customs General Administration has ordered all coastal customs offices to strictly enforce inspections.

According to statistics, from January to early March this year, customs authorities have seized 22 cases of smuggled cigarettes at sea, confiscating over 30,000 cartons of imported cigarettes worth nearly 100 million yuan. This amount far exceeds the total value of smuggled cigarettes seized by customs last year. The smuggling vessels include those from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and foreign countries, as well as domestic vessels, many of which are dedicated smuggling ships.

The Customs General Administration spokesperson pointed out that maritime smuggling activities violate Chinese laws and disrupt the country's economic order. They must be severely cracked down upon. The Customs General Administration has ordered coastal customs offices to strengthen inspections. Regardless of the nationality of the smuggling vessels, whether they come from mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan, they will all be dealt with according to the law.
