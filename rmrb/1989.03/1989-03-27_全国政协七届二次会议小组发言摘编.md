National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Seventh Session, Second Meeting, Group Speeches Excerpts

	Chemical Industry Ministry Chemical Research Institute Deputy Director Cheng Siquan said:
		To Improve the Decision-Making Level of the Leadership

	Our leaders should have a democratic style of being open-minded, have the magnanimity to tolerate different opinions, have the courage to boldly adopt new suggestions, and have the courage to take responsibility for decision-making mistakes. Soft science workers should respect the leadership, but should not flatter the leadership; should acknowledge reality, but should not compromise with reality. The CPPCC is a department where talents gather, and it should give full play to the group advantage to conduct special research on major issues. Without research, there is no decision-making power.

	Peking University Economics Professor Chen Daishun said:
		Hoping the Central Government Will Listen More to "Folklore"

	Historically, folk songs and rhymes have always reflected the voice of the people. The central leadership should understand public opinion more and listen to these voices more. Last year, I went to Hong Kong and met with people from various circles. A scholar with little property said he was very afraid of 1997, saying he had no power and no money, and that he could not bear the corruption that would come. This reflects the mindset of many middle and lower-class scholars in Hong Kong. Some of our teachers are very sad about the current state of education in our country, saying that the treatment of professors is getting lower and lower.

	Hunan Finance and Economics College Finance Department Director Wang Shiying said:
		The Rectification and Cleanup Must Be Serious

	The rectification and cleanup are related to the future of the country and must eliminate interference and have ironclad guarantees. Now, not only is there "official profiteering," but there is also "academic profiteering." It is said that the People's Bank of China's Education Department has a higher professional training program that violates the Ministry of Education's regulations and hands it over to a few vocational schools to run a "management cadre academy," resulting in the Education Department selling quotas and the management cadre academy selling diplomas. The rectification and cleanup must be serious. If there is one exception and another special case, even the best central policies will be discounted and go through the motions.

	China Youth University of Politics Party Committee Secretary Zhao Ximing said:
		To Have a Comprehensive Understanding of Youth

	In recent years, various sectors of society have had fluctuating evaluations of the younger generation, with both praise and criticism. Sometimes they are called the "lost generation," thrown to the ground, and sometimes the "thinking generation," praised to the sky. Relevant departments have many doubts about young students, and whenever it comes to memorial days like May 4th and December 9th, they are afraid that young people will cause problems. Are young people really so untrustworthy? Last year, we conducted a large-scale survey on youth issues in eight provinces and cities, and the results showed: 89% of young people support reform, 81.83% of young people think it is necessary to adhere to the four cardinal principles, but it should not be rigid. It can be seen that the majority of young people support reform and uphold the four cardinal principles. We should guide them to overcome their own shortcomings in the process of progress on the basis of trust.

	Chen Jiazheng said:
		Suggesting the Establishment of Regulations to Punish Corruption

	In the rectification of the economic environment and the cleanup of economic order, many law enforcement agencies have inconsistent punishments for criminals, and some even use fines instead of law. This is not conducive to rectification and cleanup. It is necessary to publicize typical cases in newspapers, but this is not done enough at present. It is suggested that the NPC and the State Council establish regulations to punish corruption.

	KMT Revolutionary Committee Central Committee Standing Committee Member Xu Yifang said:
		Strengthening County-Level Political Consultation

	At the grassroots level, many people do not understand what the democratic parties are. There is a big difference between the upper and middle levels and the grassroots level. The upper level pays attention to it, but when it comes to the lower level, the work is relatively difficult. Democratic parties at the municipal level can participate in political consultation, and if they can do so at the county level, it would be good, so that the CPPCC at all levels can play its role.

### 全国政协七届二次会议小组发言摘编

　　全国政协七届二次会议小组发言摘编
    化工部化工研究总院副院长成思危说：
          要提高领导层的决策水平
    我们的领导者要有虚怀若谷的民主作风，有容忍不同意见的雅量，有大胆采纳新建议的魄力，有承担决策失误责任的勇气。软科学工作者要尊重领导，但又不能迎合领导；要承认现实，但又不迁就现实。政协是人才荟萃的部门，要发挥群体优势，对重大问题作专题研究。没有研究就没有决策权。
    北京大学经济学院教授陈岱孙说：
    　　希望中央能多听听“民谣”
    从历史上看，顺口溜、民谣一直都反映人民的心声，中央领导应多了解民意、多听听这种心声。去年我去香港，接触到各界人士。有一个没什么财产的知识分子说，他很怕１９９７年，他说自己无权、无钱，不正之风污染过来受不了。这反映了香港不少中下层知识分子的心态。我们一些教师对我国教育现状很伤心，说教授待遇越来越低。
    湖南财经学院金融系主任王世英说：
    　　治理整顿要动真格的
    治理整顿关系国家前途，一定要排除干扰，要有铁的保证。现在不仅有“官倒”，还出现“学倒”，据说人民银行教育司有个高等专业培训计划，违反教委规定，交给几个中专学校办“管理干部学院”，结果是教育司卖指标、管理干部学院卖文凭。治理整顿要动真格的，若这个例外，那个特殊，中央政策再好也要打折扣、走过场。
    中国青年政治学院党委书记赵喜明说：
    　　对青年要有全面认识
    这些年，社会各界对青年一代的评价忽高忽低，褒贬不一，一会儿是“垮掉的一代”，摔到地下，一会儿是“思考的一代”，捧到天上。有关部门对青年学生疑虑重重，以至一到“五四”、“一二·九”等纪念日，便生怕青年出问题。青年一代就真的如此不值得信任吗？去年，我们在全国８个省市搞了一次较大规模的青年问题调查，结果表明：８９％的青年赞成改革，８１．８３％的青年认为有必要坚持四项基本原则，但不能僵化。可见青年的主体是支持改革，拥护四项基本原则的。我们要在信任的基础上引导他们在前进中克服自身的缺点。
    沈嘉元委员说：
    　　建议制订惩治贪污条例
    在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序中，许多执法机关惩治犯罪分子宽严不一，有的甚至以罚代法，这对治理和整顿不利。在报纸上公布典型案例是必要的，但目前做得还不够。建议人大、国务院制订惩治贪污条例。
    民革中央常委徐以枋说：
    　　应加强县级政治协商
    在基层不少人对民主党派是什么都不太懂，上层中层同基层相差很大，上面很重视，而到了下面，工作较困难。市一级民主党派能够参加政治协商，到了县一级，如果能这样就好，使各级政协都能发挥作用，就好了。
