British and French leaders discuss the "Satanic Verses" incident
Thatcher says UK-Iran relations have effectively been severed

PARIS, Feb. 28 (Xinhua) — French President François Mitterrand and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held their 13th summit meeting yesterday in Paris. The two leaders primarily discussed European conventional arms control talks, East-West relations, bilateral relations, and the Middle East situation.

Regarding the crisis sparked by "The Satanic Verses," President Mitterrand said at a post-summit press conference, "It is normal for people to gather and protest, but threatening to kill is another matter."

It is believed that Mitterrand's remarks were directed at the recent protests by Muslims in Paris.

According to reports, Prime Minister Michel Rocard has instructed that the use of violence and threats of murder be pursued "in accordance with the law."

Thatcher stated that diplomatic relations between the UK and Iran have effectively been severed.

It is reported that the leaders of France and Britain analyzed the possible developments of the situation during their meeting and formulated security measures, but did not disclose them to the public.

Regarding the modernization of Western Europe's short-range missiles, Thatcher reiterated Britain's demand for the early deployment of more modern short-range missiles, opposing West Germany's proposal to defer the issue until 1992.

President Mitterrand hopes to further consult with West German leaders before the May NATO summit.

He emphasized that this is also a matter of West German national sovereignty, and sufficient time should be given for consideration.

President Mitterrand also stated that only if a new unfavorable imbalance emerges between the Warsaw Pact and NATO in short-range missiles will NATO need to modernize its short-range missiles.

　　英法首脑讨论《撒旦诗篇》事件
    撒切尔夫人说英伊关系实际已中断
    本报巴黎２月２８日电  记者张启华报道：法国总统密特朗和英国首相撒切尔夫人昨天在巴黎举行第１３次首脑会晤，双方主要讨论欧洲常规裁军谈判、东西方关系、双边关系及中东问题等。
    关于《撒旦诗篇》引起的危机，密特朗总统在会晤后举行的记者招待会上说，“人们集会抗议，这是正常的，但以杀人相威胁，这是另一回事。”
    据信密特朗总统是针对前天巴黎穆斯林教徒上街游行一事而如是说的。
    据报道，罗卡尔总理已指示，对使用暴力和凶杀的威胁要“按照法律予以追究”。
    撒切尔夫人表示，英国与伊朗的外交关系实际上已经中断。
    据透露，法英领导人在会晤中分析了事态可能的发展，并制订了安全措施，但没有向外公布。
    关于西欧短程导弹现代化问题，撒切尔夫人重申英国要求尽早装备更为现代化的短导，反对西德关于把这个问题拖到１９９２年再定的建议。
    密特朗总统希望在５月北约首脑会议前能同西德领导人进一步磋商。
    他强调说，这也是西德国家主权的问题，应该给西德以充分的时间作考虑。
    密特朗总统还表示，只有华约与北约之间在短导方面出现新的不利的不平衡，北约才需要实现短导的现代化。
