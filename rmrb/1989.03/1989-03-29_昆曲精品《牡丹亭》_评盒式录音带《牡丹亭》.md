The world is full of contradictions. Artworks of great value are often difficult to understand because they require a high level of cultural refinement and artistic appreciation. European operas and symphonies are like this, and so is Kunqu opera. It is no wonder that in the hometown of Kunqu, Suzhou, there was once a tradition where families would have their children learn to sing Kunqu, believing it to be a mark of cultural refinement. Kunqu opera is indeed an art form with high appreciation value. It has preserved a collection of world literary classics such as "The Peony Pavilion" and "The Peach Blossom Fan." Its singing and performances embody the essence of Chinese stage art. However, for the general public, Kunqu opera can be difficult to appreciate. Therefore, to promote and preserve this traditional art form and make it accessible to more people, work needs to be done from various angles. The Jiangsu Audio-Visual Publishing House has released a cassette tape of Zhang Jiqing's performance of "The Peony Pavilion" (edited by Liang Yanhui), utilizing modern media to allow more people to appreciate this traditional art.

"The Peony Pavilion," a Kunqu opera, is a masterpiece on the stage. It is a masterpiece by the great playwright Tang Xianzu of the Ming Dynasty. The opera tells the story of the protagonist Du Liniang, who dies for love and then comes back to life for love, calling for the liberation of emotions and fiercely resisting the Neo-Confucianism that suppresses emotions. The music of Kunqu is also very beautiful and melodious. Its winding melodies, adorned with intricate decorations, form a unique lyrical style of Chinese classical music, endowing the protagonist Du Liniang with a beautiful musical image. Zhang Jiqing's performance is also renowned. She is skilled at expressing the most touching emotions from the depths of a character's heart through her beautiful voice and masterful singing techniques.

This cassette tape is a selection of scenes from "The Peony Pavilion," but it is the essence of the entire play, including selected segments from the "Garden Visit," "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Searching for Dreams," and "Separation of Souls" scenes. Attentive listeners will notice that the singing in these four scenes has four different moods. The four pieces in the "Garden Visit" scene, "Step by Step," "Drunken Return," "Cotton Robe," and "Good Sister," are a blend of pleasant spring scenery and joyful feelings. The "Dream of the Red Chamber" scene's "Mountain Goat" is a lament of youthful sorrow. The five pieces in the "Searching for Dreams" scene, "Lazy Painting," "Tete Order," "Jiaqingzi," "Yin Order," and "Jiang'er Water," include both sweet memories of dreams and sadness for the passing of dreams. The "Separation of Souls" scene's "Jixianbin" expresses the sorrowful farewell to the world due to excessive grief.

The accompanying music on this cassette tape is also enchanting. It does not merely satisfy the traditional accompaniment of "supporting the melody and preserving the tune," but creates an atmosphere that makes the singing more poetic and deepens the expression of the character's inner emotions. It sometimes takes the listener into a world of bright spring light and birdsong, as in the "Garden Visit"; sometimes it uses a quiet atmosphere to express the character's reflections on youth, as in the "Dream of the Red Chamber".... It is no easy task for an orchestra to create such profound atmospheres and yet harmonize with the traditional style of Kunqu.

　　昆曲精品《牡丹亭》        
    ——评盒式录音带《牡丹亭》
    世界上的事情就这样矛盾，有价值的艺术，往往难于理解。因为它需要有较高的文化素养与艺术鉴赏水平。欧洲的歌剧、交响乐如此，中国的昆曲也是如此。无怪乎在昆曲的家乡苏州过去有这样一种风气，一般人家总要让自己的子弟习唱昆曲，认为这是一种文化教养。昆曲确是一种有较高欣赏价值的艺术，它保存了一批诸如《牡丹亭》、《桃花扇》这样的世界文学名著，它的歌唱与表演也汇集了我国舞台艺术的精华。但对一般人来说，昆曲确也难于欣赏。因此，要使这一传统的艺术文化得以发扬光大，使得多数人能欣赏它，能领略它美之所在，需要从各方面去进行工作。江苏音像出版社推出的张继青演唱的《牡丹亭》（梁艳慧编辑），利用现代化的传播媒介，使更多的人去欣赏昆曲这一传统艺术。
    昆曲《牡丹亭》，可以说是戏曲舞台上的艺术精品。《牡丹亭》是明代大戏剧家汤显祖的力作，它以主人公杜丽娘为情而死、又为情而复生的情节，呼唤情的解放，对扼杀情的理学给以猛烈反抗。昆曲的音乐又是非常优美动听的，它婉转曲折的旋律，经过花团锦簇般的装饰，构成了中国古典音乐特有的抒情风格，并以此赋与了主人公杜丽娘的美好的音乐形象。张继青的演唱又是脍炙人口的，她善于通过美妙的歌声，通过纯熟的演唱技巧，把人物内心深处最为动人的情感细致地表达出来。
    这盒录音带只是《牡丹亭》的一部分选曲，但却是全剧的精粹，包括《游园》、《惊梦》、《寻梦》、《离魂》四个折子的选段。细心的欣赏者一定会觉察，这四折戏的唱腔，具有四种不同的情调。《游园》的〔步步娇〕、〔醉扶归〕、〔皂罗袍〕、〔好姐姐〕四支曲子，是旖旎的春光与愉悦的心情交织在一起的歌唱；《惊梦》折的〔山坡羊〕，则是青春幽怨的倾诉；《寻梦》的〔懒画眉〕、〔忒忒令〕、〔嘉庆子〕、〔尹令〕、〔江儿水〕五支曲子，既有对梦境的甜美回忆，又有为梦境逝去的感伤；《离魂》的〔集贤宾〕一曲，则唱出了终因伤情过度而辞别人世时哀伤的心声。
    这盒录音带的伴奏音乐也是诱人的。它不以传统伴奏的“托腔保调”为满足，却创造了一种意境，把歌唱衬托得更有诗意，深化了人物内心的情感的表达。它时而把人带入春光明媚、莺声燕语的境界，如《游园》；时而又以幽静的气氛抒发人物对青春的感怀，如《惊梦》……。乐队音乐能写出如此深邃的意境，并且又能与昆曲的传统风格相协调，确非易事。
