How to achieve development during the period of rectification and readjustment? This is a new topic that many factory directors and managers are currently exploring. During the meeting, five representatives from the enterprise sector of Shandong Province held a special discussion on this topic.

Deputy General Manager and Chief Engineer Yang Mianmian of Qingdao Refrigerator Factory said: "Rectification and readjustment are very necessary. It's like a train that is running too fast; the track cannot keep up, and the connecting rods have problems. Slowing down a bit and making some repairs will be beneficial." General Manager Sun Huaxin of Laiwu Xinghua Industrial Company said: "The current industrial structure has too much emphasis on processing industries, making it a big belly with front and back disconnected, which must be adjusted." General Manager Liu Yanjin of Jinning Electronic Optical Instrument Factory expressed agreement, saying: "The guiding principles are correct, and the industrial policies are good. The key is to implement them thoroughly and not to be half-hearted. We are afraid of policy changes, from one extreme to another, causing large-scale ups and downs."

During the rectification and readjustment period, many enterprises face new difficulties, mainly: shortage of funds, insufficient energy, and scarcity of raw materials. How to solve these problems? General Manager Li Guorui of Laiwu Steel Factory said that from a macro perspective, support from higher authorities is needed, and from within the enterprise, efforts should be made to tap into its own potential, strengthen management, promote dual increases and dual reductions, and lower consumption and costs. Under the premise of ensuring the completion of the state's mandatory plans, more products that are needed and sell well in society should be produced, and economic benefits should be greatly improved. General Manager Zhao Duxue of Changle County Leda Industrial Company said that the reform of the system should be continued, giving enterprises more autonomy and truly pushing them into the market. Currently, there are still too many "mothers-in-law" controlling the enterprises. The more successful an enterprise is, the more it is controlled.

Liu Yanjin believes that the development of enterprises has internal and external factors, with the external factor of national policy playing a leading role. The recently published industrial policies are good, with both support and suppression, and clear focus.

The representatives unanimously requested that the state and relevant departments at higher levels should not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach to different enterprises. Li Guorui said: "Currently, funds are tight, and banks should not tighten their control over enterprises to the same extent but should go down to investigate and research, clarify which enterprises should be supported, and thus provide strong support; which enterprises should be suppressed, and thus firmly restrict them." Liu Yanjin said: "The implementation of profit and tax linkage is good, but the method of linkage should be differentiated. The starting points of different enterprises are not the same, and a uniform linkage method will not be beneficial to enterprises that originally had good performance. We cannot whip the fast cow."

　　产业政策好　只盼早落实        
    ——山东省企业界人大代表的心声
    本报记者  于宁
    如何在治理整顿中求得发展？这是当前很多企业的厂长、经理正在努力探索的新课题。会议期间，来自山东省企业界的５位全国人大代表就此专门进行了座谈。
    青岛市电冰箱总厂副厂长兼总工程师杨绵绵说：“进行治理整顿很有必要，好比一列机车开得太快了，路基不适应，连杆有毛病，适当放慢速度，修整一下，大有好处。”莱芜市兴华实业总公司总经理孙华心说：“现在的产业结构中加工工业比重太大，是个大肚子，前后脱节，非调整不可。”济宁电子光学仪器厂总厂厂长刘延民表示赞同，他说：“指导方针对，产业政策好，关键在于贯彻到底，不要虎头蛇尾。我们就怕政策多变，从一个极端跑到另一个极端，造成大上大下。”
    在治理整顿中，许多企业遇到新的困难，主要是：资金短缺、能源不足、原材料紧缺。怎样解决这些问题呢？莱芜钢铁总厂厂长李国瑞说，从宏观上需要上级的支持，从企业内部要努力挖掘自身潜力，加强经营管理，开展双增双节，降低消耗和成本。在顾全大局、保证国家指令性计划完成的前提下，多生产社会上需要的适销对路的产品，大力提高经济效益。昌乐县乐达实业公司总经理赵笃学说，应当继续推进体制改革，给企业更大的自主权，把企业真正推到市场上去。现在企业的婆婆还是太多。哪个企业搞得好一些，婆婆就管得更厉害。
    刘延民认为，企业发展有内部因素和外部因素，外部因素中起主导作用的是国家的政策。新近公布的产业政策有保有压，重点明确，非常好。
    国家和上级有关部门对不同的企业不要一刀切，是五位企业家一致的要求。李国瑞说：“现在资金紧张，银行对企业不应同等程度地收紧，而应下去调查研究，搞清哪些企业是该保的，从而大力扶持；哪些企业是该压的，从而坚决限制。”刘延民说：“实行利税挂钩很好，但是挂的办法应有区别。各个企业的起点不一样，挂法千篇一律，原来效益好的企业就不合算。不能鞭打快牛。”
