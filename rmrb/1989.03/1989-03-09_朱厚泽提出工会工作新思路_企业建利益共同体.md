In base-level units, establish enterprise benefit communities and promote the mass and democratic construction of base-level trade unions. This is a new direction for promoting trade union work proposed by the first secretary of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Zhu Houze, at the "Experience Exchange Meeting on Deepening Enterprise Reform by Relying on the Masses of Workers" currently being held in Beijing.

Zhu Houze believes that after ten years of reform and the gradual establishment of a new order of commodity economy, enterprises have the possibility of becoming independent, self-supporting commodity operating units with relative independence, providing external conditions for the establishment of enterprise benefit communities. From the perspective of the enterprise's internal environment, to form a benefit community, three conditions are needed. First, it is necessary to coordinate the material interests of all parties; second, there must be a common pursuit and a common ideal to form the enterprise spirit; third, the vast majority of workers should be able to participate in the enterprise's decision-making. In short, within the enterprise benefit community, people have common material interests, spiritual consensus, and a common value system, thereby forming harmonious interpersonal relationships.

At the meeting, Zhu Houze also proposed two other new directions for promoting trade union work: one is to promote the work of local trade unions participating in politics and legislation, especially strengthening the political participation of municipal-level trade unions, to better play the role of trade unions as a social and political organization. The other is, on the basis of revitalizing the grassroots and strengthening the legislation and political participation of the upper levels, to promote the reform of the trade unions themselves.

　　朱厚泽提出工会工作新思路
    企业建利益共同体
    新华社北京３月７日电  （记者顾洪洪）“在基层建立企业利益共同体，推进基层工会的群众化、民主化建设。”这是全总书记处第一书记朱厚泽，在正在北京召开的“依靠职工群众深化企业改革经验交流会”上提出的推动工会工作的一个新思路。
    朱厚泽认为，经过十年改革和商品经济新秩序的逐步建立，使企业有可能成为独立的自负盈亏的商品经营单位，具有了相对的独立性，为建立企业利益共同体提供了外部条件。从企业内部来讲，要形成利益共同体，还需要三个条件，一是要协调各方面共同的物质利益关系；二是要有共同的追求、共同的理想，形成企业精神；三是广大职工能参与企业的决策。总之在企业利益共同体内的人，物质上有共同的利益关系，精神上有共识，有共同的价值观，从而形成和谐的人际关系。
    在会上，朱厚泽还提出了推动工会工作的另外两个新思路：一个是推动地方工会参政议政工作，尤其是加强市一级工会的参政议政，更好地发挥工会这个社会政治团体的作用。一个是在搞活基层、强化上层立法、参政议政基础上，推进工会自身改革。
