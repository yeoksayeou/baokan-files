The General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine today held a dialogue with business representatives from 14 countries to hear their opinions and suggestions on China's commodity inspection work.

The two-hour dialogue was lively. An American business official expressed the hope that China's commodity inspection departments would further improve their work efficiency. The Japanese business representative said that in China's foreign trade system reform, export rights have been delegated to local foreign trade companies, and some of the products exported to Japan by these companies have quality issues. He hoped that the commodity inspection departments would help do a good job in inspecting export products.

It is understood that such dialogue meetings will be held regularly.
