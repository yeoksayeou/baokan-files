The State Forest Fire Command has issued a notice. A forest fire in Jin County, Liaoning Province, on March 14 resulted in serious casualties. The command has ordered relevant departments to thoroughly investigate the responsibilities and take serious action. It also requires all regions to learn from this incident, implement the forest fire prevention responsibility system, and strive to achieve the goal of significantly reducing the number of forest fires and losses this year compared to last year, and to prevent major forest fires.

Deputy Minister of Forestry Liu Guangyun pointed out at the scene of the Jin County fire that the main cause of this forest fire was lax fire management and complacency. Although the local area had made arrangements for fire prevention this spring, the responsibility system was not implemented, inspections and supervision were insufficient, and the use of fire in violation of regulations was widespread, leading to the fire.

The State Forest Fire Command stated in the notice that those who performed well in firefighting should be commended and rewarded; the Liaoning Provincial Forest Fire Command Office was criticized for not grasping the situation of this forest fire in a timely manner and was ordered to conduct a thorough review and improve its work.

It is understood that some forest areas in southern China have entered a critical period for fire prevention, and the forest areas in Northeast China and Inner Mongolia have also entered the spring fire prevention period. The Ministry of Forestry requires all regions to focus on comprehensive prevention work centered on fire source management, learn from the lessons of the Jin County fire, and not be complacent in any way.

　　国家森林防火总指挥部发出通报        
    锦县森林火灾伤亡重大 
    务必查清责任吸取教训
    本报北京３月２３日讯  记者高保生报道：３月１４日发生在辽宁省锦县的一场森林火灾，造成了严重的人员伤亡事故。最近，国家森林防火总指挥部发出通报，责成有关部门认真查清责任，作出严肃处理，并要求各地认真吸取教训，落实森林防火责任制，为实现今年森林火灾次数和损失明显低于去年、不发生大的森林火灾目标而努力。
    林业部副部长刘广运在锦县火灾现场指出，这场森林火灾主要是由于火源管理不严、思想麻痹大意造成的。今春当地对防火工作虽然作了部署，但责任制不落实，检查、监督不够，违反规定用火很普遍，以至酿成火灾。
    国家森林防火总指挥部在通报中提出，对扑火有功人员给予表扬奖励；辽宁省森林防火指挥部办公室对这起森林火灾情况掌握不及时，责成其认真检查，改进工作。
    据了解，目前我国南方一些林区已进入防火关键时期，东北、内蒙古林区也进入春季防火期。林业部要求各地狠抓以火源管理为中心的全面预防工作，吸取锦县火灾教训，不能有丝毫的麻痹大意。
