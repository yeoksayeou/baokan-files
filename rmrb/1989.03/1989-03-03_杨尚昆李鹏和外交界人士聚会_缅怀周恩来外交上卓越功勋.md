Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, and diplomats gathered to commemorate Zhou Enlai's outstanding diplomatic achievements

	Beijing, March 2 (Xinhua) — On the eve of the 91st anniversary of Comrade Zhou Enlai's birth, the "Zhou Enlai's Diplomatic Thought and Practice Seminar" opened today at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

	Leaders Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Wu Xueqian, Qin Jiwei, Geng Biao, Ji Pengfei, Huang Zhen, and more than 500 colleagues from the diplomatic front and experts and scholars researching international issues gathered to commemorate Zhou Enlai's outstanding achievements in the diplomatic field.

	At the meeting, greetings from Li Peng and Li Xiannian were read.

	In his greeting, Li Peng pointed out that Comrade Zhou Enlai is not only a great revolutionary of the proletariat but also a great diplomat of the proletariat. He has done a great deal of pioneering and effective work on China's diplomatic front, winning China a high international status and reputation. It is a very meaningful task to systematically expound and summarize Comrade Zhou Enlai's diplomatic thoughts and practices. He hoped that all diplomatic personnel would take Comrade Zhou Enlai as an example, study his diplomatic thoughts and practices, and apply them concretely in light of the changing and developing world situation, and carry them forward.

	In his greeting, Li Xiannian said: Comrade Zhou Enlai has made historical and enormous contributions to the development of mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese people and the people of the world, to the opposition against imperialism, to the maintenance of world peace, and to the promotion of the progress of human beings. He has written a brilliant chapter in the history of diplomacy in China and the world, winning high praise from the international community. Comrade Zhou Enlai is not only an outstanding leader beloved by the Chinese people but also a renowned statesman and diplomat recognized by the contemporary world.

	Foreign Minister Qian Qichen delivered a speech at the opening ceremony. He said that Comrade Zhou Enlai is one of the main leaders of our party and state, and at the same time, he is the most influential diplomat in contemporary China and the world. For 26 years, Comrade Zhou Enlai, as a decision-maker, commander, and practitioner, with extraordinary energy, talent, and wisdom, made the most comprehensive and outstanding contributions to the diplomatic cause of New China. All major foreign actions since the founding of the nation were personally practiced and directly commanded by Comrade Zhou Enlai. After reviewing Comrade Zhou Enlai's diplomatic practice since the founding of the nation, he said that Comrade Zhou Enlai's diplomatic practice can be said to be a microcosm of the diplomatic history of New China. Calling Comrade Zhou Enlai the founder and pioneer of New China's diplomacy is well-deserved. In the 1980s, under the direct leadership of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the new situation opened up by China's diplomacy was also developed on this basis.

	He finally pointed out that in the new situation, we should focus on learning and researching Comrade Zhou Enlai's thoughts on independence and self-reliance, peaceful coexistence, foreign economic relations, etc., to promote the establishment of a new international political order and a new international economic order, and to create a more favorable international environment for China's socialist modernization construction.

	Geng Biao, Ji Pengfei, Xia Yan, Li Qi, Han Nianlong, and other comrades spoke at the meeting. The seminar was organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

    杨尚昆李鹏和外交界人士聚会
    缅怀周恩来外交上卓越功勋
    本报北京3月2日讯　记者成元生、温宪报道，在周恩来同志诞辰91周年前夕，“周恩来外交思想与实践研讨会”今天在北京人民大会堂开幕。
    杨尚昆、李鹏、吴学谦、秦基伟、耿飚、姬鹏飞、黄镇等领导人和500多名外交战线的同志及研究国际问题的专家、学者聚集一堂，共同缅怀周恩来在外交战线的丰功伟绩。
    会上，宣读了李鹏和李先念的贺词。
    李鹏在贺词中指出，周恩来同志不仅是伟大的无产阶级革命家，而且也是伟大的无产阶级外交家，在我国外交战线上进行了大量的、卓有成效的开创性工作，为我国赢得了崇高的国际地位和威望。系统地阐释、总结周恩来同志的外交思想与实践，是一项很有意义的工作。他希望全体外事人员都要以周恩来同志为榜样，努力学习他的外交思想与实践，结合世界形势的变化和发展加以具体运用并使之发扬光大。
    李先念在贺词中说：周恩来同志为发展中国人民和世界各国人民的相互了解和友谊，为反对帝国主义、维护世界和平和促进人类进步事业，作出了历史性的巨大贡献，在中国和世界外交史上谱写了光辉的篇章，赢得了国际社会的高度赞扬。周恩来同志不但是中国人民敬爱的卓越领导人，也是当代世界公认的杰出的政治家和外交家。
    外交部长钱其琛在开幕式上发表了讲话。他说，周恩来同志是我们党和国家的主要领袖之一，同时也是当代中国和世界最有影响的外交家。周恩来同志在长达26年中，以决策人、指挥者、实践家三位一体的身份，以异乎寻常的精力、才能和智慧，为新中国的外交事业作出了最全面、最杰出的贡献。建国以来的所有重大对外行动，都是周恩来同志亲自实践和直接指挥的。他回顾了建国以来周恩来同志的外交实践后说，周恩来同志的外交实践可以说是新中国外交史的缩影。把周恩来同志称作新中国外交的创始人、奠基者是当之无愧的。80年代，在邓小平同志的直接领导下，我国外交所开创的新局面也是在这个基础上发展起来的。
    他最后指出，在新的形势下，我们要着重学习、研究周恩来同志关于独立自主、和平共处，对外经济关系等方面的思想，为促进国际政治新秩序和国际经济新秩序的建立，为我国社会主义现代化建设创造更加有利的国际环境而努力。
    耿飚、姬鹏飞、夏衍、李琦、韩念龙等同志在会上作了发言。这次研讨会是由外交部举办的。
