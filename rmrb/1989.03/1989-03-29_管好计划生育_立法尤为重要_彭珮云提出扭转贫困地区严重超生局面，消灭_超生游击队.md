The head of the State Family Planning Commission, Peng Peiyun, said on March 27 while participating in the discussion of the Heilongjiang Provincial Delegation that the urgent task of family planning work is to strengthen leadership and accelerate legislation.

Peng Peiyun said that the current situation facing China's family planning work is very severe. In some places, weak leadership and false reporting of achievements are quite serious. The Party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to this. Premier Li Peng said that in the future, the State Council will hold two meetings a year, chaired by him, to jointly coordinate and solve problems related to family planning. The main leaders of local party and government organizations must take personal responsibility, establish a system of accountability at all levels, and achieve results in the short term. The National Bureau of Statistics will publish the population natural growth rate indicators for each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government every year to strengthen supervision of family planning work in various places.

Peng Peiyun pointed out that in order to reverse the serious overpopulation situation in impoverished areas, the State Council has decided to combine poverty alleviation work with family planning and will take measures to quickly "eliminate" the "guerrilla" overpopulation in the floating population.

When discussing family planning legislation, Peng Peiyun said that without legal basis, family planning work is difficult to carry out, and current legislation is particularly urgent. The State Council has decided to first draft the Provisional Regulations on Family Planning, which will be issued this year, and formal legislation will be carried out when the time is ripe.

    彭珮云提出扭转贫困地区严重超生局面，消灭“超生游击队”
    新华社北京３月２８日电  （记者徐江善、郑战国）国家计划生育委员会主任彭珮云２７日在参加黑龙江省代表团讨论时指出，计划生育工作的迫切任务是，加强领导，加快立法。
    彭珮云说，当前我国的计划生育工作面临的情况十分严峻，领导不力、虚报成绩在一些地方相当严重。党中央、国务院对此十分重视。李鹏总理说，今后国务院每年召开两次由他主持的国务院办公会，共同协调、解决计划生育方面的问题。各地党政主要负责同志要亲自抓，层层建立责任制，在短期内抓出成效。国家统计局每年公布各省、自治区、直辖市人口自然增长率的指标，以加强对各地计划生育工作的监督。
    彭珮云指出，为了扭转贫困地区超生严重局面，国务院已决定，把扶贫工作与计划生育结合起来，并将采取措施尽快“消灭”流动人口中的“超生游击队”。
    在谈到计划生育立法工作时，彭珮云说，没有法律根据，计划生育工作很难开展，当前立法工作尤其迫切。国务院决定先制定出计划生育暂行条例，在今年内出台，时机成熟后，再正式立法。
