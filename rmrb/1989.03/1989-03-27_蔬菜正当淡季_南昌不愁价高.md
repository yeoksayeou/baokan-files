Vegetables in the Off-Season: Prices in Nanchang Remain Stable

	Nanchang, March 26 (Xinhua) — The vegetable production units and large-scale vegetable growers in the suburban counties and farms of Nanchang have recently signed vegetable production and sales contracts with the state-owned and collective vegetable markets (stores) of the city's vegetable company. This is a measure taken by Nanchang to get through the spring off-season and avoid sharp fluctuations in vegetable prices.

	The Nanchang urban area requires about 300,000 kilograms of vegetables daily. During the peak season, the vegetable fields in the suburban counties can produce over 500,000 kilograms, leading to a surplus; during the spring off-season, only about 200,000 kilograms can be supplied, causing prices to skyrocket.

	Currently, the vegetable company and vegetable production units are implementing a new method of contract bidding and purchasing. This allows for a planned supply of vegetables by the month and by the day, ensuring a stable supply regardless of the season. A minimum protective price for vegetables is set to maintain stability.

　　蔬菜正当淡季        
    南昌不愁价高
    本报南昌三月二十六日电  南昌市各郊县和农场的蔬菜生产单位和种菜大户，近日纷纷与市蔬菜公司的国营、集体菜场（店）签订蔬菜产销订购合同。这是南昌市为渡过每年春淡，避免菜价暴涨暴落而采取的措施。
    南昌市区日需蔬菜三十多万公斤。在旺季时郊县各菜地可出产五十多万公斤，形成积压；春淡季节只能上市二十多万公斤，菜价暴涨。
    现在蔬菜公司和蔬菜生产单位实行投标合同订购新方法，可以按月按日定计划上市数量，不分淡季旺季定出最低蔬菜保护价。
