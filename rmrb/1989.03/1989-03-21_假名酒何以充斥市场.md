Title: How Fake Liquor Floods the Market

Fake liquor has become rampant in the market. The manager of the Wuliangye Liquor Factory in Yibin revealed to a reporter before the New Year: at least 70% of the "Wuliangye" sold in the market is counterfeit.

Before the Spring Festival, the Standard Metrology Bureau of Xi'an City inspected four department stores selling Xifeng Liquor, and found none of them were genuine.

Since last year, Sichuan Province has discovered and sealed up more than 830,000 bottles of various fake liquors; Shenyang City has seized nearly a million bottles of fake white liquor in just one year.

The proliferation of fake liquor seriously harms the interests of consumers. People are puzzled: after years of crackdowns and suppression, why has this illegal activity become more rampant?

	Gigantic profits lead to reckless behavior

Last month, the Shenyang City Bureau of Industry and Commerce busted a gang selling fake Maotai and fake Wuliangye, totaling 42,000 bottles. Industry and commerce officials went to the source of these fake liquors in Taiqian County, Henan Province, and were shocked: households in the countryside buy low-quality liquor from the market for 3-4 yuan per bottle, replace the labels with self-made fake brands, and resell them for 50-60 yuan per bottle. A single family workshop can produce 8,000 bottles of fake liquor in one night.

The shortage of high-quality branded liquor provides an opportunity for lawbreakers to produce and sell fake liquor. The huge profits generated by the significant price increase of branded liquor in the second half of last year have further tempted these lawbreakers to take risks.

It is worth noting that some state officials, driven by greed, have also been drawn into this "black tide" and cannot extricate themselves. Peng, the office director of the Judicial Bureau of Tongren Region, Guizhou Province, sold 8,000 bottles of fake Maotai liquor. Among these, Peng alone made a profit of 1.8 million yuan from selling 2,400 bottles to Yichun City, Jiangxi Province. Another major case of producing and selling fake Maotai liquor in Guizhou Province involved a diverse group of suspects, including party members, military personnel, university teachers, retired cadres, unemployed individuals, and released prisoners.

	Political achievements make cases hard to investigate and prosecute

In October 1987, the China Consumers' Association and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce held an unprecedented exhibition of counterfeit goods in Beijing. For a time, counterfeit goods became the talk of the town. Good-hearted people once again thought that this time, counterfeiting would be completely eradicated, or at least significantly curbed! However, reality played a trick. In the following year and a half, the "rats" still strutted down the streets...

People were outraged and began to turn their attention to the law enforcement agencies: "What are you doing? How can you not even stop the sale of fake branded liquor?"

Faced with the public's inquiries, many economic law enforcement officials had bitter complaints. What was the difficulty? Although the production and sale of fake branded liquor harmed consumers, it could open up a tax source for local governments and increase fiscal revenue. The increase in fiscal revenue was an important indicator for evaluating the performance of a government.

In Shaanxi Province, a county produced and sold tens of millions of bottles of fake branded liquor in the first half of 1987, but the county government, considering the "revenue," long allowed the proliferation of fake liquor. This resulted in the "brand-name" inferior liquor being sold all the way to Beijing. Last year, in just three months, two district bureaus of industry and commerce in Beijing seized more fake Xifeng liquor from this county than the commercial department allocated to Beijing in a year.

Not just one place, government officials at various levels loudly declared at meetings that they would strictly seal off fake liquor factories. But when law enforcement agencies took real action, they would find every possible way to intervene, even personally issuing orders to resume production.

Thus, a strange phenomenon emerged. Almost all cases of producing and selling fake branded liquor investigated by local law enforcement agencies were against outsiders, not locals. They loudly condemned fake branded liquor from other places, but turned a blind eye to local production and sale of fake liquor. This abnormal phenomenon was sarcastically referred to as "blind spots."

The current fiscal management system and the cadre evaluation system have not only strengthened the utilitarianism of local governments but also made various administrative law enforcement departments have to act according to the facial expressions of local government leaders. The economic law enforcement "blind spots" thus produced are worth pondering.

Producing and selling counterfeit and shoddy goods to make illicit profits is not an innovation by lawbreakers in China. The problem is that countries with relatively healthy commercial order have a set of severe punishment measures. In our country, although senior leaders have repeatedly emphasized that "lawbreakers should be fined until they go bankrupt," this directive has been ignored in some places and has not been implemented.

"Save the branded liquor! Clean up the counterfeit brands!" The public's calls are still fresh in our minds. How to truly protect the interests of consumers, I'm afraid we can no longer treat this matter lightly.

### 假名酒何以充斥市场

　　假名酒何以充斥市场
    ·造假名酒有暴利可图        
    ·一些国家工作人员见利忘义卷入“黑潮”        
    ·地方政府当成“财路”，睁只眼，闭只眼
    本报记者  潘岗
    元旦前夕，宜宾五粮液酒厂厂长向记者发表谈话：市场上出售的“五粮液”，起码有７０％是假货。
    西安市标准计量局春节前抽查了四个百货商场销售的西凤酒，无一真货。
    四川省去年以来已发现、封存各类假酒达８３万多瓶；沈阳市一年间就查获假冒白酒近百万瓶。
    假酒泛滥，严重损害着消费者的利益。人们弄不明白：经过持续数年的打击、制止，为何这种非法活动反而愈演愈烈？
    　　　　巨额利润引发铤而走险
    沈阳市工商局上月破获了一起贩卖假茅台、假五粮液４．２万瓶的团伙。工商管理人员前去这些假名酒的产地——河南省台前县一看，目瞪口呆：一家一户的农民，从市场上买来三四元一瓶的劣等酒，换贴上自制的假商标，转手就卖五六十元一瓶。而一个家庭作坊，一夜间就产假酒８０００瓶。
    优质名酒供应不足，给不法分子制售假名酒以可乘之机。去年下半年名酒销价大幅度提高后产生的巨大利润，更诱发了这些不法分子铤而走险。
    值得注意的是，一些国家工作人员见利忘义，也卷入这一“黑潮”而不能自拔。贵州省铜仁地区司法局办公室主任彭某，倒卖假茅台酒８０００余瓶。其中仅倒卖给江西省宜春市２４００瓶一笔，彭就获利１８万元。而贵州省破获的另一起制售假茅台酒大案，作案人员囊括了党员干部、现役军人、大学教师、离休干部、待业人员、劳改释放者各色人等。
    　　　　谋取政绩使案件难查难办
    １９８７年１０月，中国消费者协会、国家工商局在京举办了规模空前的假冒商品展览会，一时间，假冒商品成为过街老鼠。善良的人们又一次以为，这下假冒行为不说彻底绝迹，也该大大收敛了！然而，现实又开了个玩笑。此后一年多，“老鼠”仍大摇大摆地过街穿道……
    人们愤怒了，开始把目光投向执法机关：“干什么吃的？怎么连小小假冒名酒也制止不了？”
    面对群众的质询，许多经济执法人员有苦难言。难在何处？制售假名酒虽然坑害消费者，但它却能为当地政府开辟税源，增加财政收入。而财政收入的增加，正是考察一届政府“政绩”的重要依据。
    陕西有个县１９８７年上半年制售假名酒几十万瓶，而该县政府一味考虑“财路”，长期听任假酒泛滥。致使“名牌”劣酒一路销向北京。去年，仅北京市两个区工商局３个月查获的产自这个县的假西凤酒，就比商业部门一年调拨给北京的真西凤酒还多。
    不止一地的政府要员，大会上口口声声表示要严加查封假酒厂。可当执法机关动了真格的时候，又千方百计说情，甚至亲自批示恢复生产。
    于是就出现了这样的奇怪现象。地方执法机关查处的制售假名酒案件，差不多都是只查外地，不查本地。对外地产的假名酒声而讨之，而对当地制售假名酒活动，则睁只眼，闭只眼。这种不正常的现象，被人们讽刺为“灯下黑”。
    现时的财政分灶吃饭的体制和干部考核制度，既强化了地方政府的功利主义意识，又使得各行政执法部门必须仰视当地政府首长脸色行事。由此产生的经济执法“灯下黑”现象，很值得深思。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    制售假冒伪劣商品，赚取不义之财，并非不法分子在中国的首创。问题是，商品经济秩序比较健全的国家，有一套严厉的惩罚措施。而在我国，尽管高级领导人多次强调对于不法分子“要罚得他们破产”，然而这一指示在一些地方至今被束之高阁，未能落到实处。
    “救救名酒！”“清除假冒的名牌货！”群众的呼声言犹在耳。如何真正保护消费者的利益，恐怕再不能等闲视之了。
