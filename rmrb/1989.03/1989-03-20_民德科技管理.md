	Technological Management in the GDR
	By Xǔ Hóngzhì, People's Daily Reporter

	Recently, the reporter interviewed Klaus Hermann, State Secretary and Deputy Minister of the Science and Technology Department of the German Democratic Republic, on the issue of integrating scientific research with production.

	Hermann pointed out that the Science and Technology Department is responsible for formulating technological plans, studying the integration of scientific research with production, determining the number of central plans, the extent of autonomy for joint enterprises, and establishing a system of responsibilities.

	The state should focus on the most important research projects. 20% of technological capabilities should be applied to executing national plan projects, while 80% should be used for projects determined autonomously by joint enterprises. In 1989, the total national research funding amounted to 13 billion Marks, of which 3 billion Marks were allocated by the state, with the remainder being borne by the joint enterprises.

	The Science and Technology Department focuses on key projects, particularly high technologies and critical processes, such as the development of microelectronics, new materials, and biotechnology. The state-funded research funds are primarily concentrated on these projects.

	Hermann introduced some practices of integrating scientific research with production in the GDR. He said that the GDR has begun to establish research institutions directly within joint enterprises, managing everything from research and development to manufacturing and sales. In addition to comprehensive engineering within joint enterprises, since 1985, joint enterprises have been able to sign cooperative research and development contracts with academies and universities. Another method is for joint enterprises to collaborate with academies to establish research institutes, thereby enabling research results to quickly generate economic benefits.

	He also mentioned that basic scientific research should not be neglected. A strong foundation in basic research is essential for future development.

	When discussing international cooperation, Hermann said that a country like the GDR cannot do everything on its own. Therefore, developing international cooperation in high technology is very important. It is gratifying to note that in recent years, the cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and China in science and technology, especially in high technology, has been progressing smoothly. Chinese research institutions are important partners for the German Democratic Republic. He expressed that there is a broad prospect for scientific and technological cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and China.

　　民德科技管理
    本报记者  许宏治
    最近，记者就科研与生产相结合这一问题，采访了民主德国科技部国务秘书、副部长克劳斯·赫尔曼。
    赫尔曼指出，科技部负责制定科技计划，研究科研与生产相结合的问题，确定应有多少种中央计划，给联合企业多大的自主权，建立什么样的责任制。
    国家要把最重要的科研项目抓好。２０％的科技能力应用于执行国家计划项目，８０％用于联合企业自主确定的项目。１９８９年全国科研经费总共为１３０亿马克，其中３０亿马克系国家拨款，其余由联合企业承担。
    科技部重点抓主要项目，特别是高技术、关键工艺，如发展微电子、新材料、生物工程等。国家拨给的科研经费也主要集中使用于这些项目。
    赫尔曼介绍了民主德国科研与生产相结合的一些做法。他说，民德已经开始实行直接在联合企业内设立科研机构的办法，从研究、开发、制造一直到销售，均由联合企业管理。除了在联合企业进行的综合工程外，从１９８５年起，联合企业可以和科学院、高等学校签订合作研究、开发的合同。还有一种办法是联合企业和科学院合办研究所，这样，能使科研成果尽快地产生经济效益。
    他还说，基础科学研究也不可忽视。有了强大的基础研究能力，才能为发展奠定基础。
    谈到国际合作问题时，赫尔曼说，像民德这样的国家不可能什么都自己搞，因此，发展高技术方面的国际合作很重要。令人高兴的是，近年来，民主德国和中国在科技特别是在高技术方面的合作进行得很顺利。中国的科研机构是民主德国的重要伙伴。他表示，民主德国和中国之间的科技合作有着广阔的前景。
