		Spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Date for Consultations Between Chinese and Vietnamese Vice Foreign Ministers Not Yet Determined

		Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 9th: Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Li Zhaoxing stated today that the specific date for the second round of consultations between the vice foreign ministers of China and Vietnam on the political resolution of the Cambodian issue has not yet been determined.

		He made these remarks at a press conference this afternoon in response to reports that Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach had stated on the 8th that Vice Foreign Minister Ding Rulian would visit China in mid-March.

		Li Zhaoxing said, China's consistent stance is that the normalization of Sino-Vietnamese relations depends on whether the Cambodian issue can be resolved quickly and justly through political means. He pointed out that Nguyen Co Thach's recent statements and Vietnam's recent actions once again demonstrate that Vietnam persists in its rigid stance and lacks sincerity in politically resolving the Cambodian issue. As long as the Cambodian issue remains unresolved justly and fairly, and Vietnam's stance does not change substantially, Sino-Vietnamese relations will not see significant improvement, let alone normalization.

### 外交部新闻发言人说  中越副外长磋商日期尚未商定

　　外交部新闻发言人说
    中越副外长磋商日期尚未商定
    新华社北京３月９日电  外交部发言人李肇星今天在这里说，中国、越南两国副外长就政治解决柬埔寨问题再次举行磋商的具体日期尚未商定。
    他是在下午的新闻发布会上就有报道称越南外长阮基石８日说丁儒廉副外长将于３月中旬访华讲这番话的。
    李肇星说，中越关系正常化取决于柬埔寨问题能否尽快得到公正合理的政治解决，这是中国的一贯立场。他指出，阮基石最近的讲话和越南最近的行动再次表明，越南仍坚持其僵硬立场，缺乏政治解决柬埔寨问题的诚意。柬埔寨问题迟迟得不到公正合理的解决，越南的立场没有实质性改变，中越关系也就难有大的改善，更谈不上正常化。
