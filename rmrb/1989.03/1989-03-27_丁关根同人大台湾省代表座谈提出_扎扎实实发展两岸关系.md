Ding Guangren Discusses with NPC Representatives from Taiwan Province on Developing Cross-Strait Relations

	BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Ding Guangren, Director of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, visited the delegation of National People's Congress (NPC) representatives from Taiwan Province yesterday to discuss further development of cross-strait relations.

	Ding said that in accordance with the spirit of the State Council, the Taiwan Affairs Office will, under the premise of adhering to the principles of peaceful reunification and "one country, two systems" and the rectification and reform of the open policy, develop cross-strait relations, increase contact, enhance understanding, and promote mutual recognition and common ground.

	He said that this year, three aspects of work should be focused on: first, continuing to develop cross-strait economic and trade exchanges; second, doing a good job in receiving Taiwanese compatriots returning to the mainland for visits and tourism, with a focus on improving the quality of reception; third, increasing exchanges in the fields of culture, sports, academia, and education. These three aspects of work have great potential and will promote the development of cross-strait relations in a direction conducive to peaceful reunification.

	During the meeting, the representatives made many positive suggestions on developing cross-strait exchanges and the work of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office. Ding expressed that he would actively study and coordinate with relevant departments to solidly develop cross-strait relations.
