The county mayor's mailbox is really effective. On July 5th of last year, County Mayor Jiang Huanchang listened to the suggestions of the masses and established the "County Mayor's Mailbox."

Before the "County Mayor's Mailbox" was set up, because local issues could not be promptly reported, some problems that the masses urgently needed to solve could not be addressed. After the "County Mayor's Mailbox" was established, the masses could promptly reflect their problems, and it also facilitated the county government leaders in understanding the actual situation and solving the problems in the masses' production and life. On May 3rd of last year, the power supply to the Xidaowozi Residential Community was cut off, and the power supply department delayed in restoring it. In early July, a fifth-grade student from the attached primary school of County No. 7 Middle School wrote a letter to the "County Mayor's Mailbox" to report this issue. The county government immediately held a meeting to discuss the restoration of the power supply. The next day, Deputy County Mayor Wang Shouzhi and leaders and technical personnel from relevant departments went to the Xidaowozi Residential Community. Subsequently, relevant county leaders personally organized fundraising, followed up on materials, and solved construction difficulties. Two months later, the lights in the Xidaowozi Residential Community were on again.

Last summer, a heavy rainstorm caused the drainage ditch near the central market in the county seat to be blocked, and the surrounding residential areas were flooded. Some masses reported this problem to the relevant departments, but no one paid attention, so they had to complain to the "County Mayor's Mailbox." On July 15th, Comrade Jiang Huanchang convened a meeting, criticized the work style of mutual buck-passing among the relevant departments, and required the immediate organization of forces to drain the accumulated water.

By the end of last year, the "County Mayor's Mailbox" had received 52 letters from the masses reflecting problems, of which 11 related to the vital interests of the masses had all been resolved.

### “县长信箱”真顶用

　　“县长信箱”真顶用
    去年７月５日，我县姜焕昌县长听取群众建议，设立了“县长信箱”。
    在“县长信箱”设立前，因下情不能及时上达，致使一些群众迫切需要解决的问题得不到解决。设立“县长信箱”后，群众有问题可以及时反映，也便于县政府负责人了解实际情况，解决群众生产、生活中的问题。去年５月３日，西大洼子居民小区断了电，供电部门迟迟没有接通，７月上旬，县七中附小五年级一名学生写信向“县长信箱”作了反映。县政府当即召开会议，研究恢复供电的问题。第二天，副县长王守志和有关部门领导同志及技术人员，一起来到西大洼子居民小区。随后，县里有关领导人亲自组织筹款，过问材料，解决施工难点。两个月后，西大洼子居民小区的电灯又亮了。
    去年夏季一场暴雨，县城中心市场附近的排水沟堵塞，民房周围都是积水。一些群众向有关部门反映这一问题，无人理睬，只得投诉“县长信箱”。７月１５日，姜焕昌同志召集会议，批评了有关部门互相推诿扯皮的工作作风，并要求迅速组织力量排出积水。
    到去年底，“县长信箱”已收到群众反映问题的来信５２件，其中关系群众切身利益的１１件已全部得到了解决。
