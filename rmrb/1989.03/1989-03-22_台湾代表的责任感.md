On the afternoon of March 21, the reporter visited the residence of the Taiwan Province delegation. The reporter knocked on the doors of several representatives.

Reporter: Representative Fan, discussions will begin tomorrow. What do you plan to say?

Fan Zengsheng (49 years old, from Taoyuan, Taiwan, Master's degree, Deputy Director of Shanghai Port Bureau): I returned to the country from the United States in 1980. These years, I have truly felt the prosperity that reform has brought to the economy and the benefits it has brought to the people. The achievements of the country's various works are evident to all. However, there are also many difficulties and problems currently facing us, the most prominent of which is the obvious inflation and price increases. Premier Li Peng proposed that we should prepare to tighten our belts for a few years. I think to achieve this, we must start with the government at all levels. If the government does not set an example, it will lose its appeal. If the government and the party's leading organs set a good example, the people of the entire nation will work together to improve the rectification and adjustment.

When the reporter knocked on the door of Huang Shunxing, who became a "newsmaker" at the first session of the Seventh National People's Congress, he was talking with a reporter from Taiwan.

Reporter: I'm sorry to interrupt, it seems you had a prior appointment.

Huang Shunxing (65 years old, from Zhanghua, Taiwan, University degree, Advisor to the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Standing Committee Member of the National People's Congress): Yes, if you had made an appointment in advance, it would have been better. However, I can briefly share some of my thoughts with you. Tomorrow, we will discuss the government work report, but the report was only distributed to the representatives the night before last. The National People's Congress meets once a year, and it is not easy. When reviewing such an important government document, it should at least be distributed to the representatives upon their arrival in Beijing.

The reporter visited the room of Representative Lu Yizhong, who was reading documents.

Reporter: Sorry to disturb you.

Lu Yizhong (41 years old, from Taizhong, Taiwan, University degree, Head of the Engineering Mechanics Research Room and Professor at the Xi'an Transportation University in Shaanxi Province): Let me talk to you about the education issue. Teaching was quite enjoyable a few years ago, but now students are unwilling to study and only want to make money early. We teachers feel uncomfortable about this.

Just then, Representative Wu Guozhen returned to the room.

Reporter: Representative Wu, please share your thoughts as well.

Wu Guozhen (41 years old, from Taipei, Taiwan, Ph.D., Member of the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Chemistry): My views are somewhat similar to those of Lu Yizhong. Currently, the "uselessness of studying" theory is resurfacing, and it can be said that "positive and negative logic is reversed, and values are confused." I feel that our country's education is facing a crisis. We must face this crisis and take measures to reverse it, which is the positive approach...

　　台湾代表的责任感
    本报记者  王谨
    ３月２１日下午，记者来到台湾省代表团的驻地，叩开了几位代表的房门。
    记者：范代表，明天就要进行讨论了，你打算说些什么？
    范增胜（４９岁，台湾桃园人，硕士，上海港务局副局长）：我１９８０年从美国回国，这些年确实感受到改革给经济带来了繁荣，给人民带来了实惠。国家各项工作所取得的成绩，是有目共睹的。但是，目前面临的困难和问题也不少，最突出的表现是明显的通货膨胀、物价上涨。李鹏总理提出要准备过几年紧日子，我觉得要做到这一点，首先要从各级政府做起，政府起不到表率作用，就会失去号召力。政府和党的领导机关做好了样子，全国民众就会同舟共济搞好治理整顿。
    记者敲开曾在七届人大一次会议上成为“新闻人物”的黄顺兴代表的房门时，他正和一位来自台湾的记者谈话。
    记者：来得不巧，看来你事先有约会。
    黄顺兴（６５岁，台湾彰化人，大学，中国农业科学院顾问，人大常委）：是呀，你要是事先约一下就好了。不过，我可以简单向你谈一点我的想法。明天就要讨论政府工作报告了，可是报告直到前天晚上才发到代表的手中。全国人民代表大会一年开一次不容易，审议这么重要的政府文件，起码应该在代表到北京报到时就发到代表的手中。
    记者来到陆毅中代表的房间，他正在看文件。
    记者：打扰了。
    陆毅中（４１岁，台湾台中人，大学，陕西省西安交通大学工程力学系教研室主任、教授）：我跟你谈谈教育问题吧。前些年教书还比较愉快，现在学生不愿读书，只想早点赚钱，我们作教师的心里不舒服。
    正说着，吴国祯代表回到了房间。
    记者：吴代表你也谈谈吧。
    吴国祯（４１岁，台湾台北人，博士，台盟中央主席团委员，中国科学院化学所研究员）：我的看法和陆毅中有些相似。目前，“读书无用论”又有所抬头，可以说是“正负逻辑颠倒，价值观念错乱”。我觉得我国的教育正面临着一场危机，正视这场危机并采取措施扭转它，才是积极的……
    时间有限，虽未能深谈，但却从几位代表的言谈中看到奔涌在他们心中的“代表意识”和责任感。
