At the Hebei Hotel, this reporter interviewed National People's Congress representative and Executive Vice Governor of the Shandong Province, Xíngtái Region, Xú Jīnzài, on the issue of integrating science and technology with the economy.

Xú Jīnzài reviewed the achievements made in recent years by more than ten counties and cities in the Xíngtái Region in deepening the reform of the scientific and technological system and comprehensively promoting the integration of science and technology into the economy. He summarized, "From the practice in the Xíngtái Region, the higher the level of scientific farming, the higher the grain and cotton yields; the higher the level of fruit tree management, the higher the fruit production; the higher the level of scientific breeding, the faster the development of livestock and poultry."

Xú Jīnzài proposed three constructive opinions on forming a mechanism to promote the close integration of science and technology with the economy:

First, develop technology contracting groups. This is an important form of leveraging the advantages of scientific and technological personnel, conducive to giving full play to the roles of various talents, forming a technological synergy, and truly unifying the economic and technological contracting and service activities in the pre-production, production, and post-production stages.

Second, promote the separation of administration and technology. This is an important channel for forming an efficient and flexible new scientific and technological operation mechanism and for transferring science and technology to the production and economic sectors.

Third, strengthen scientific and technological input around advantages. This is an effective way to enhance the role of science and technology in economic construction. In scientific and technological input, it is necessary to emphasize the close integration of science and technology with local advantages and to explore the best input-output benefits.

Xú Jīnzài said, "The path of relying on capital, resources, energy, and manpower to develop the economy is no longer viable. Instead, we must rely on reform and internal development. All of these cannot be separated from technological progress."

"The most crucial point is that science and technology must enter the main battlefield of economic construction. Only in this way can we achieve the revitalization of China's rural economy."

　　科技要进入经济建设主战场        
    ——访全国人大代表、邢台地区行署专员徐金在
    本报记者  李建兴
    在河北饭店，记者就科技与经济相结合的问题采访了全国人大代表、河北省邢台地区行署专员徐金在同志。
    徐金在同志历数了近几年邢台地区十几个县市深化科技体制改革，全面推动科技进入经济取得的成绩后，总结说：“从邢台地区的实践看，哪里的科学种田水平高，哪里粮棉产量就高；哪里果树管理水平高，哪里的果品产量就高；哪里的科学饲养水平高，哪里的畜禽发展就快。”
    徐金在同志提出了促进科技同经济密切结合机制形成的三条建设性意见：
    一，发展技术承包集团。这是发挥科技人员群体优势的重要形式，有利于发挥各种人才的作用，形成技术合力，使产前、产中、产后等环节的经济技术承包、服务活动真正统一起来。
    二，推行政技分离。这是形成高效、灵活的新型科技运行机制，疏通科技向生产领域和经济领域转移的重要渠道。
    三，围绕优势增强科技投入。这是强化经济建设中科技效能的有效途径。在科技投入中，必须注重使科技与当地优势紧密结合，探索最佳投入产出效益。
    徐金在说：“再靠拚资金、拚资源、拚能源、拚人力来发展经济，这种路子行不通了，而是要靠改革、靠内涵。这些都离不开科技进步。”
    “最关键的一点是科技要进入经济建设主战场。只有这样，才能实现我国农村经济的振兴。”
