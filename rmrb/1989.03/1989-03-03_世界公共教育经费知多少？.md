According to recent figures released by UNESCO, by 1986, the world's public education funding totaled $793 billion. Developed countries accounted for 87 percent of this amount, while developing countries, though only contributing 13 percent, had increased their share by 4 percent compared to 1970.

In the vast Third World, African countries saw a continuous and significant increase in education funding during this period. Algeria, Egypt, and Nigeria alone accounted for over 50 percent of the total education funding in Africa.

Additionally, Brazil and Mexico contributed over 50 percent of the total education funding in Latin American countries.

From 1970 to 1986, the world's per capita education funding increased by 370 percent, rising from $44 to $162. Statistics show that in developed countries, per capita education funding increased from $141 to $594, a 420 percent increase. This growth rate was lower than that of the vast majority of developing countries. In the Third World, per capita education funding increased from $5 to $28, a 560 percent increase.

    据联合国教科文组织最近公布的数字，至一九八六年，世界公共教育经费共达七千九百三十亿美元，发达国家占百分之八十七，发展中国家虽仅占百分之十三，但已比一九七○年的百分之九增加了百分之四。
    在广大第三世界，非洲国家在此期间的教育经费有持续的明显增加，而阿尔及利亚、埃及和尼日利亚的教育经费占非洲教育经费总额的百分之五十以上。
    此外，巴西和墨西哥的教育经费也占拉丁美洲国家总额的百分之五十。
    自一九七○年至一九八六年，全世界的人均教育经费增加了百分之三点七倍，即从四十四美元增至一百六十二美元。据统计，发达国家的人均教育经费由一百四十一美元增至五百九十四美元，增加四点二倍，增长幅度小于广大的发展中国家。第三世界国家的人均教育经费在同一时期从五美元增至二十八美元，增加五点六倍。
