The Transformers Wave

Reporter Lai Renqiong

No one had anticipated that within a few short months, major cities like Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing would be swept by a rapid and intense "Transformers" craze. On February 19, Hu Dexue and 20 other members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress suggested stopping the broadcast of the American television series "Transformers." Suddenly, opinions from all sectors of society were divided, with both praise and criticism. Transformers became a hot topic of conversation on the streets. Domestic and foreign newspapers in the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan also published news and commentary on the subject. Such widespread attention to a children's television show and its related toys is unprecedented in our country.

Why did Transformers become so popular in China in such a short time?

Children are obsessed, parents reluctantly pay

Television broadcasts boost toy sales

During the New Year and Spring Festival, Beijing's Xidan Commercial Center, Longfu Department Store, and Wangfujing Department Store jointly held an exhibition and sale of American "Hasbro" Transformers. Children who received "lucky money," students who performed well in their exams, parents who had promised their children, and outsiders who joined the queue all rushed to the toy counters. Some people bought as soon as they had money, while others hesitated and worried about the high prices. At this time, children clung to the counter, and some even questioned their parents for not keeping their promises! Loving parents gritted their teeth and bought the toys. Children who got the "Optimus Prime" were overjoyed, while parents left a heavy impression on the sales staff.

The deputy manager of the Wangfujing Toy and Entertainment Store, Qin Fangming, introduced that this store only exhibited and sold four or five types of Transformers, but the retail revenue reached over 800,000 yuan. No other toy has sold as well as Transformers. In fact, the real products from the American "Hasbro" company were few, and most were imitation counterfeits. However, among the tens of thousands of buyers, regardless of where the "Transformers" on the counter were made or whether the price was reasonable, as long as the packaging box had English letters, they would generously pay.

Compared to state-owned stores, individual vendors in Beijing have more information, faster procurement, and earlier sales. They were the first to take large amounts of cash to Guangdong to place orders. Experts estimate that Guangdong supplied individual vendors with "Transformers" at 8 yuan each, with a cost of only 2-3 yuan, but they sold them for 35-36 yuan in Beijing. A state-owned store sold "Transformers" at the Temple Fair in Ditan, which were all bought by individual vendors and resold at double the price before leaving the fairground.

Despite the high prices of "Transformers" toys, which were several times or even tens of times higher than their production costs and had long surpassed the affordability of ordinary Chinese families, there were still people who willingly paid high prices to individual vendors. Some spent over a hundred yuan to buy "Optimus Prime" and "Megatron." During the height of the "Transformers" craze, from kindergarten to primary school students, over 90% had a Transformers toy. Someone told the reporter that in Guangzhou, a parent bought 40 Transformers for their child, spending over 2,000 yuan, and in Shanghai, a child stole 300 yuan from home to buy Transformers.

The sales staff at the toy store said that television advertising greatly helped toy sales. If it weren't for the television, Transformers on the counter would not have sold.

Outdated ideas, missing out on business opportunities

Lost opportunity, too late to catch up

When it comes to the "Transformers" craze, Meng Qingxuan, the director of the Beijing Toy Research Institute, still regrets it deeply. Three years ago, the American "Hasbro" company learned that a certain television station in Beijing might broadcast the animated series "Transformers," and quickly sent representatives to Beijing for negotiations. However, Beijing did not create conditions for joint ventures, and the American side was concerned about various factors such as transportation, telecommunications, customs clearance, and station reporting that would delay the production and sales of toys, resulting in failed negotiations. Soon, "Hasbro" company found two toy factories in Singapore and Hong Kong for joint production of "Transformers" toys, and then found several factories in Shenzhen for assembly.

Relevant personnel in Beijing did not pay much attention because there had been dozens of such unsuccessful negotiations. However, when they saw that cities from south to north were competing to sell "Transformers," and over a hundred stores in Beijing sent staff to Guangdong to urge orders, colleagues in the Beijing toy industry finally realized the missed opportunity. In the heat of the moment, a few factory directors were inspired and boldly proposed to produce "Transformers." Meng Qingxuan said, do not underestimate plastic "Transformers," one type of "Transformers" requires 20-30 molds, with a mold fee of 60,000-70,000 yuan, and it is said that the complete set of Transformers has over 600 types, how much would the mold fee be? Moreover, Beijing's mold production generally takes over 4 months, and the technology and craftsmanship are far behind, so the idea of starting production was abandoned.

Currently, although the "Transformers" craze in Beijing has cooled down, the impact of Transformers is still worth reflecting on for China's toy industry.

Learn from Guangdong, research the market, and innovate

Reflect and rise, re-recognize the toy industry

Transformers were developed by the Japanese five years ago. After being unsold in the domestic market, they sold the patent to the American "Hasbro" company. In 1986, the sales of "Transformers" in the United States reached 1.6 billion dollars. Later, Americans imitated the Japanese and set their sights on the Chinese market with over 300 million children. The "Hasbro" company indeed had a smooth sale.

Why did the Americans on the other side of the Pacific Ocean study the psychology of the Chinese people so deeply? Why did they understand the market situation in China so accurately? They did not come early or late, but specifically came after the television series "Transformers" was broadcast to promote "Transformers," is this not worth us studying carefully?

The technological level of a country can be directly reflected in the toy manufacturing industry. Although toys are small, they involve many disciplines and fields such as electronics, machinery, modeling, chemistry, textiles, metallurgy, plastics, psychology, education, art, health, and more.

With the development of science and technology and the improvement of people's living standards, toys are also required to have decorative, ornamental, and collectible properties. Newlyweds buy a long-haired teddy bear to decorate and display in their cabinet; someone spends hundreds of yuan to buy over 100 miniature cars of world-famous brands, just for collection. Currently, the toy industry has become an economic pillar in many countries around the world, while our country only regards it as a small commodity. In fact, the design, production, and sales of toys are complex, and our country has an increasingly broad market, why can't we change our strategy in time to quickly catch up with the world's advanced level?

As both the manager of the Beijing Toy Industry Company and the director of the Beijing Toy Research Institute, Meng Qingxuan does not feel relaxed when talking about the current situation of Beijing's toy industry. Beijing has 12 toy manufacturers, producing 7 categories of toys including metal, plastic, and wood. Due to various reasons such as traditional products, rising raw material prices, and backward technology, the output value dropped from 54 million yuan in 1986 to 37 million yuan in 1988. Beijing produces over 1,000 types of toys, with only 1/3 being popular. Excluding 10% sold locally, the rest are mostly exported to the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest regions where toy manufacturing is not yet developed. The Beijing Wangfujing Toy and Entertainment Store, which specializes in toys, has almost no Beijing-made toys on its counters! Last year, several toy factories had to produce civilian chimneys, timers, furniture, and other items to "support" toys, otherwise, the toy factories in trouble would be difficult to continue!

In contrast to Beijing's toy industry, southern provinces have emerged and are thriving. Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other provinces introduce thousands of new toy varieties each year. Guangdong Province alone has increased its toy factories from the original 7-8 to over 1,500, with an annual output value increasing from the original 30 million yuan to 1.5 billion yuan in 1987, with most products exported to Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, the United States, and other places. In Shenzhen, an individual toy egg processor is known as the "Toy King," processing over 10 million toy eggs a year, all sold to Europe and America. In Guangdong and Fujian coastal areas, joint-venture factories, wholly-owned factories, and township enterprises producing toys are everywhere. Their success not only gives us various beneficial thoughts and enlightenment but also lets us see the prospects and hope of China's toy industry.

May more people care about toys, care about children, and design the future!

"Transformers" attract children like a magnet, but our country's toy industry has few products with such charm.

### 变形金刚冲击波

　　变形金刚冲击波
    本报记者  赖仁琼
    谁也未曾料到，在短短几个月内，广州、上海、北京等大城市相继兴起一阵疾如风、快如电的“变形金刚”热。２月１９日，胡德华同志等２０位人大常委建议停播美国电视片《变形金刚》。一时间，社会各界议论纷纷，褒贬不一，变形金刚成为人们街谈巷议的热门话题。国内和美国、香港、台湾的多家报纸也纷纷就此发表消息和评论。如此众多的人从不同角度关注一部儿童电视片的播映和玩具的进口、销售，这在我国还是第一次。
    为什么变形金刚能在极短时间风靡中国？
    　　　　孩子着魔　痴心父母忍痛解囊
    　　　　电视连播　助玩具商一臂之力
    元旦春节期间，北京西单商场、隆福大厦、王府井百货大楼玩具娱乐品商场联合举办美国“孩之宝”变形金刚展销。得了“压岁钱”的孩子，期末考了好成绩的学生，向儿女“许了愿”的家长和看见长队就跟着排的外地人，纷纷涌到玩具柜台前。有人掏钱就买，也有人为价高而踌躇、犯愁。这时，孩子赖在柜台前不走，有的甚至质问父母说话不算数！痴心的父母一咬牙，买！孩子得到“大力神”，欢天喜地，而父母，留给售货员一个沉重的背影。
    王府井玩具娱乐品商场副经理钦方明介绍，这家商场仅展销四、五个金刚品种，零售款即达８０多万元，从没有哪种玩具像变形金刚这样畅销。其实，真正的美国“孩之宝”公司的产品是少量的，大部分是仿制的冒牌货。然而成千上万的买主中，不管柜台上的“金刚”产于何地？价钱是否公道？只要是包装盒上印着英文字母的变形金刚，便慷慨解囊。
    与各国营商店相比，北京的个体摊贩信息灵、进货快、销售早。他们最先携带大量现款赶到广东订货。行家估算，广东批给个体户８元１个的“金刚”，成本也就二、三元，而他们拿回北京卖三十五六元。有家国营商店在地坛庙会出售的“金刚”被个体户全部买下，然后不出地坛门就翻番出售。
    尽管价格昂贵的“金刚”玩具售价高出造价几倍甚至几十倍，并且早已超越普通中国家庭的承受力，然而，自愿掏钱买小贩的高价“金刚”者有之，出手百余元买“擎天柱”、“大力神”者有之。“金刚”热盛行时，从幼儿园小班的孩子到小学高年级学生，９０％以上都有一个变形金刚玩具。有人告诉笔者，广州有家长为孩子买４０多个“金刚”，花去两千多元，上海有个孩子从家里偷拿３００多元去买变形金刚。
    玩具店的售货员说，电视宣传给玩具销售帮了大忙。如果不看电视，变形金刚摆在柜台上也没人买。
    　　　　观念陈旧　找上门来的生意不做
    　　　　失去良机　再想找回已时过境迁
    提起“金刚”热，北京玩具研究所所长孟庆选至今都后悔莫及。３年前，美国“孩之宝”公司得知北京某家电视台可能播放动画片《变形金刚》，便火速派员来京谈判。但是，北京没有为合资创造条件，美方担心交通、电讯、报关、报站等诸多因素贻误玩具生产和销售“战机”，谈判失败。不久，“孩之宝”公司在新加坡、香港找了两个玩具厂合资生产“金刚”玩具，随后又在深圳找了几个厂组装。
    北京有关人士并未在意，因为这样不成功的谈判有过几十次。然而，当他们见到从南到北的大城市竞相销售“金刚”，北京百余家商店派员坐镇广东催货时，北京玩具业的同仁们才深感痛失良机。热浪之中，有几个厂长怦然心动，大胆提出生产“金刚”。孟庆选说，切莫小看塑料“金刚”，一种“金刚”需要开模具２０至３０多个，需模具费六、七万元，据说全套变形金刚有６００多种，那模具费得多少呢？加之北京生产模具一般得４个多月，技术、工艺都远不及人家，只好打消了上马的念头。
    目前，尽管北京的金刚热已经降温，但变形金刚的冲击，是很值得我国玩具业反思的。
    　　　　借鉴广东　研究市场推陈出新
    　　　　反思奋起　重新认识玩具行业
    变形金刚是日本人５年前研制的。本国滞销后，便将专利卖给美国“孩之宝”公司。１９８６年，全美“金刚”销售额１６亿美元。之后，美国人又仿效日本人，把目光瞅准了有３亿多儿童的中国市场，“孩之宝”公司果然“销运”亨通。
    远在大洋彼岸的美国人为什么把中国人的心理研究得如此之透？对中国市场的行情摸得如此之准？他们早不来，晚不来，偏偏赶上电视片《变形金刚》播放后推销“金刚”，难道不值得我们很好地研究吗？
    一个国家科技水平的高低，可直接从玩具制造业反映出来。玩具虽小，但它涉及到电子、机械、造型、化工、纺织、冶金、塑料、心理、教育、美术、卫生等许多学科和领域。
    随着科学技术的发展，人民生活水平的提高，又对玩具提出了装饰性、观赏性、收藏性等要求。新婚夫妇买个长毛绒狮子狗摆在组合柜里，是为了装饰和观赏；有人花几百元买１００多辆寸余长却制造精美的世界名牌小轿车也仅是为了收藏。目前，玩具业已成为世界上不少国家的经济支柱，而我国却只把它作为小商品。其实，玩具的设计、制造、销售是门复杂的学问，而我国又有一个越来越广阔的市场，为什么不能及时改变策略，以便迅速赶上世界先进水平呢？
    既是北京玩具工业公司经理，又兼北京玩具研究所所长的孟庆选，谈起目前北京玩具业现状时并不轻松。北京有玩具厂家１２个，分别生产金属、塑料、木制等７类玩具。因传统产品多、原材料涨价、技术落后等多种原因，产值从１９８６年的５４００万下降至１９８８年的３７００万。北京地区生产玩具品种１０００多个，好销的只占１／３，除１０％在本地销售外，其余的大都外销到东北、西北、西南等玩具制造尚不发达地区。专营玩具的北京王府井玩具娱乐品商场，柜台上几乎没有北京产的玩具！去年，几个玩具厂不得不以生产民用烟囱、定时器、家具等来“养”玩具，否则，身陷困境的玩具厂难以为继！
    与北京玩具业相反，南方各省异军突起，蒸蒸日上。广东、福建、浙江、江苏等省每年推出玩具新品种数千种。仅广东一省，玩具厂从原来的７、８家增至现在的１５００多家，年产值从原来的３０００多万猛增到１９８７年的１５个亿，产品大部分出口到香港、日本、南朝鲜、美国等地。深圳有个加工“玩具蛋”的个体户，人称玩具王，一年加工“玩具蛋”１０００多万个，全部销往欧美。在广东、福建沿海生产玩具的合资厂、独资厂、乡镇企业星罗棋布。他们的成功除了给我们种种有益的思考和启迪，还让我们看到了中国玩具业的前景和希望。
    愿更多的人关心玩具，关心孩子，设计未来！

    “变形金刚”像磁石一样吸引孩童，我国的玩具业却极少具有如此魁力的产品。
