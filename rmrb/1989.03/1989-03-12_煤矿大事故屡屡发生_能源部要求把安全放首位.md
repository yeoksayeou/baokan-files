Major accidents in coal mines have occurred frequently. The Ministry of Energy requires prioritizing safety.

BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) — According to information obtained by Xinhua today from the Ministry of Energy, in 1988, there were more than 250 major accidents in coal mines in China resulting in the deaths of three or more people. Over 6,000 people lost their lives, with a significant proportion of these accidents occurring in township coal mines. It is reported that 36% of major accidents were caused by gas and coal dust explosions, followed by roof collapses, water inrushes, and flooding.

Discussing the causes of these accidents, a responsible official from the Ministry of Energy said that, in addition to outdated equipment and long-standing management issues, the recent overall shortage of coal has led to new problems. The pressure to meet production targets and increase output has led to neglect of safety measures. Many coal mines face financial difficulties, leading some bureaus and mines to prioritize operations over safety. Additionally, some township and individual coal mines engage in reckless mining practices, contributing to the increase in fatal accidents.

In response, the Ministry of Energy has issued opinions on coal mine safety, emphasizing that all coal mines must firmly prioritize safety in production and strive to achieve higher standards. The goal for this year is to reduce the death rate per million tons of coal to below 2 for state-controlled mines and below 6 for local mines.

　　煤矿大事故屡屡发生
    能源部要求把安全放首位
    本报北京３月１０日讯  记者王彦田报道：记者今天从能源部获悉：１９８８年我国煤矿发生３人以上重大死亡事故２５０多起；有６０００多人丧生，其中乡镇煤矿占的比重较大。据介绍，重大事故中瓦斯煤尘爆炸占了３６％，其次是冒顶、透水、水灾事故。
    谈到事故原因，能源部负责人说，除了技术装备差、管理上的老问题外，近年煤炭全面紧张也带来了新问题。因为压任务、突产量，忽视安全生产；煤矿增支因素多，日子不好过，一些局矿重经营，轻安全；一些乡镇和个体煤矿胡挖滥采，也使死亡事故增多。
    为此，能源部就煤矿安全工作提出意见，要求各煤矿坚定不移地把安全生产放在第一位，要向更高标准扎实迈进；提出今年统配煤矿百万吨死亡率力争降到２以下，地方煤矿降到６以下。
