Reforming the Old System, Exploring New Paths
The Seventh National Art Exhibition Prepares to Overcome Difficulties

Our reporter Ma Ke and Xinhua News Agency reporter Yin Hongzhu report from Beijing, March 2: The preparation work for the Seventh National Art Exhibition, which had been delayed due to insufficient funds, has now been turned around thanks to the joint efforts of relevant departments and artists across the country. The reporter learned from the recent China Artists Association working conference held here that this large-scale art exhibition is now ready and will be held as scheduled.

Our country's national art exhibitions are held every five years. In the past, the funds were fully provided by the Ministry of Culture, and the China Artists Association and its local branches, which were responsible for the specific organizational work, also followed the "unified" old method, mainly relying on administrative means to organize artists' creations. As a result, the state spent a lot of money, but the effect was not very good.

This national art exhibition, the Ministry of Culture's funding is only half of the previous exhibition. Facing such limited funds, the organizers and artists at various levels of the exhibition, with a spirit of pioneering and innovation, sought new paths. On the one hand, they utilized their own advantages, carried out various paid services, increased capital accumulation, and actively sought support and sponsorship from local and social sectors. On the other hand, they increased the transparency and consultation of organizational work, activated the atmosphere of artistic research, and fully mobilized the enthusiasm of artists for creation, thus enabling the preparation and creation work of the exhibition to proceed smoothly.

The situation reflected by the representatives from various places indicates that tens of thousands of artists are currently working hard to create, striving to show their talents in the Seventh National Art Exhibition.

Vice Minister of Culture Ying Ruocheng praised the approach of cultural departments, art organizations, artists, and social forces working together to run cultural enterprises at this conference. He believes that in the reform of the cultural system, "collective wisdom, increasing transparency, mutual respect, and mutual consultation" should form an atmosphere.

The Seventh National Art Exhibition, co-sponsored by the Ministry of Culture and the China Artists Association, will kick off with a printmaking exhibition in Kunming in May, followed by exhibitions of Chinese painting, oil painting, sculpture, printmaking, and other genres in Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Harbin, Shenyang, Shenzhen, and other cities.

In September, 300 award-winning works selected from various exhibition areas will be gathered in Beijing and exhibited during the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation and the second China Art Festival. At that time, national-level gold, silver, and bronze medals, as well as individual awards from the Wu Zuoren International Art Foundation, will be presented.

The organizing committee of the Seventh National Art Exhibition was established on February 27, with Ying Ruocheng as the chairman and Wu Zuoren, president of the China Artists Association, as the vice chairman.

    改革旧体制　探寻新路子
    七届全国美展走出困境筹备就绪
    本报北京3月2日讯　记者马克、新华社记者尹鸿祝报道：曾经因为经费不足而使七届全国美术作品展览筹备工作一度进展缓慢的状况，如今在各地有关部门和美术家们的共同努力下得以扭转。记者从最近正在这里召开的中国美术家协会工作会议上得知，这次大规模的美展目前已准备就绪，展览将如期举行。
    我国的全国性美展每五年举行一次，以往的经费均由文化部“全包”下来，而负责具体组织工作的中国美术家协会及各地分会也是遵循“大一统”的老办法，主要依靠行政手段去组织美术家的创作，结果往往是国家花钱不少，但效果并不太好。
    这次全国美展，文化部拨款数额仅为上届美展的一半。面对如此少的经费，展览的各级组织者和美术家们以开拓进取的精神寻求新路。他们一方面利用自身优势，开展各种有偿服务，增加资金积累，大力争取地方、社会的支持与赞助，另一方面增加组织工作的协商与透明度，活跃艺术研讨气氛，充分调动美术家的创作积极性，从而使美展的筹备、创作工作得以顺利开展。
    与会各地代表汇集的情况表明，数以万计的美术家目前正在加紧创作，力争在七届全国美展中一显身手。
    文化部副部长英若诚在这次会议上对文化部门、艺术团体、艺术家和社会力量联合办文化事业的作法表示赞赏。他认为，在文艺体制改革中，“集思广益、增加透明度、互相尊重、互相协商”，应该形成一种气氛。
    由文化部和中国美术家协会联合主办的七届全国美展，将由5月于昆明举行的版画展拉开序幕，之后陆续在北京、南京、广州、上海、哈尔滨、沈阳、深圳等地分别举行中国画、油画、雕塑、版画等十几个画种的展览。
    9月份，从各个展区评选出的300件获奖作品将汇集北京，在建国40周年之际和第二届中国艺术节期间展出。届时将颁发国家级的金银铜牌奖及吴作人国际美术基金会等单项奖。
    第七届全国美展组委会已在2月27日成立，英若诚任主任委员，副主任委员是中国美术家协会主席吴作人。
