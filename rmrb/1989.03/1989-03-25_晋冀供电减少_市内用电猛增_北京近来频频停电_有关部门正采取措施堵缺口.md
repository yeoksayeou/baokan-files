		Power Supply from Shanxi and Hebei Decreases, Urban Electricity Demand Surges
		Beijing Experiences Frequent Power Outages, Relevant Departments Taking Measures to Address the Shortage

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 24 (Reporters Pan Shantang and Wu Xiaojun) This year, Beijing has experienced numerous temporary power outages, affecting both industrial production and the daily lives of residents.

A responsible official from Beijing's planning, energy-saving, and electrical safety department told reporters that Beijing is an energy-deficient city, with one-third of its electricity supplied by Shanxi and Hebei provinces. However, since the second half of last year, these two provinces have faced coal shortages for power generation, resulting in reduced electricity supply to Beijing.

Another factor contributing to Beijing's significant electricity shortage is the rapid increase in electricity consumption. Last year, the state allocated only a 3.15% increase in electricity to Beijing compared to the previous year, while urban residential electricity consumption surged by 28.67%. According to a survey, in recent years, Beijing residents have added tens of thousands of infrared electric heaters and nearly 60,000 air conditioners to their households, along with a large number of color televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines. The total electrical capacity of these household appliances is at least 100,000 kilowatts. Additionally, the completion and operation of several high-end and mid-range hotels and restaurants have further widened Beijing's electricity supply gap.

To alleviate the current severe power shortage, relevant departments in Beijing are taking measures, including prioritizing coal supply to power plants and implementing reduced electricity quotas for some major electricity consumers. Furthermore, Beijing's electricity department will issue electricity bonds to raise funds for the construction of new power plants.

　　晋冀供电减少　市内用电猛增        
    北京近来频频停电   有关部门正采取措施堵缺口
    据新华社北京３月２４日电  （记者潘善堂、吴小军）今年以来，北京市临时拉闸限电次数繁多，不仅使工业生产受到影响，也给市民生活带来不便。
    北京市主管计划、节约、安全用电部门的负责人告诉记者，北京是能源短缺的城市，１／３的电力靠山西、河北两省输送。但从去年下半年开始，这两省发电用煤短缺，因而对北京的供电量减少。
    用电量增长过快，是造成北京电力缺口过大的另一个原因。去年国家给北京的电力只比前年增加３．１５％，而城镇居民生活用电却增长了２８．６７％。据调查，近年来，北京居民家庭增加了上万个红外线电子加热器和近６万台空调机，还有数量众多的彩电、冰箱、洗衣机等，这些家用电器的电容量至少在１０万千瓦以上。再加上几十家用电大户——高、中级旅游饭店、宾馆陆续建成使用，使北京的供电缺口越来越大。
    据了解，为了缓解目前严重缺电的状况，北京市有关部门正采取措施，优先给电厂供煤，并对一些用电大户实行减额供电。此外，北京市电力部门还将发行电力债券，集资新建电厂。
