When mentioning Soviet youth, the older generation in China naturally thinks of Soviet youth heroes like Ostrovsky, Zoya, Stakhanov, and Gagarin. Decades have passed, and what are today's Soviet youth thinking and doing?

Currently, the Soviet Union is undergoing reforms in the political and economic spheres. The 66 million Soviet youth, who make up nearly a quarter of the country's total population, are enthusiastic supporters of this reform. A public opinion poll in Moscow last year showed that the vast majority of youth support the government's reform policies. According to Soviet newspapers, in recent years, the number of honest and hardworking young people has increased, with 75% of young workers nationwide working diligently and paying attention to product quality. In Moscow, there are 45,000 young people under the age of 35 who have formed more than 30 scientific and technological research centers, engaging in research and promoting research results during their spare time, creating an annual value of 50 million rubles.

Soviet youth care about national affairs, with 60% joining the Komsomol. Among the 20 million members of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, 18% are under 30 years old. Currently, the broad masses of Soviet youth are actively participating in the elections for Soviet People's Deputies, and many outstanding young people have been nominated as candidates for People's Deputies.

Diligence and a love for learning are characteristics of Soviet youth. Most Soviet youth families subscribe to three or four newspapers and magazines, and enjoy having books at home. In the Soviet Union, whether in parks, on buses, or in lines for shopping, one often sees young people engrossed in reading, diligently studying. Domestic and foreign literary classics, as well as magazines reflecting contemporary thought trends, are their favorite reading materials.

Young people are the main force in construction. They build the Baikal-Amur Mainline and the Tyumen oil fields in the uninhabited wilderness of Siberia, construct the giant Yamburg oil and gas field in the harsh climate of the Arctic Circle, and make their own contributions in fields such as aerospace, sports, and Antarctic exploration. University students actively participate in public welfare labor during their spare time, and every summer vacation, tens of thousands of them volunteer to go to construction sites in Siberia, the Far East, and the Arctic. Some even work in stores, hotels, as salespeople, cleaners, and waiters. Their actions not only support national construction but also increase personal income and reduce family burdens. In the earthquake relief efforts in Armenia, Soviet youth of various ethnic groups donated blood to the injured, participated in voluntary labor to raise funds for the disaster area, and formed construction teams to build houses for the victims.

Among Soviet youth, there are also those who do not understand the reforms and feel confused, who are bewildered by many unfortunate events that have occurred in the country over the 70 years since the October Revolution, and who have short-sighted views, pursuing comfortable small family lives. Some acquire wealth through improper means, even resorting to crime. Some youth, when facing difficulties in love, marriage, or work, turn to alcoholism, drug abuse, or even suicide. In recent years, the Soviet Union has averaged 50,000 to 60,000 suicides per year, with a significant portion being young people. Among young women, there are also those who are lazy and live off prostitution, with some contracting AIDS as a result.

In today's Soviet Union, "many conflicts, unstable" young families have become a social problem. According to official statistics, in 1986, there were 347 divorces per 1,000 couples nationwide; in 1987, 9.531 million families broke up. The divorce rate in large cities is as high as 50%.

These negative trends are spreading among Soviet youth, and many have left the Komsomol. The number of Komsomol members has decreased from 42 million in 1985 to 38 million in 1988.

The Soviet government and the Komsomol have expressed great concern about the above situation.

　　他们在想什么做什么？
    ——当今苏联青年面面观
    万成才
    提起苏联青年，我国中老年一代很自然就会想起奥斯特洛夫斯基、卓娅、斯达汉诺夫、加加林等苏联青年英雄。岁月流逝，３０多年过去了，当今的广大苏联青年在想些什么？做些什么？
    目前，苏联正在进行政治、经济等领域的改革，占全国总人口近１／４的６6００万苏联青年是这场改革的热情支持者。莫斯科去年一次民意测验结果表明，绝大多数青年支持政府的改革方针。据苏联报纸报道，近几年来诚实工作的青年人数增加了，全国７５％的青年工人劳动认真，重视产品质量。莫斯科有４．５万３５岁以下的青年，组成了３０多个科学技术研究中心，利用工余时间从事研究和推广研究成果，每年创值５０００万卢布。
    苏联青年关心国家大事，其中６０％加入共青团，在２０００万苏共党员中，３０岁以下的青年占１８％。目前，广大苏联青年正积极参加苏联人民代表的选举活动，许多优秀青年已被推举为人民代表的候选人。
    勤奋好学是苏联青年的特点。苏联青年的家庭一般都订有三、四种报刊，喜欢家庭藏书。在苏联，无论在公园、公共汽车上还是排队购物，经常可看到青年们手不释卷，孜孜地攻读。国内外文学名著以及反映当代思想潮流的刊物都是他们最喜爱的读物。
    青年人是建设大军的主力。他们在荒无人烟的西伯利亚修建贝阿大铁路和秋明油田，在气候恶劣的北极圈内建设巨大的扬堡油气田，在宇航、体育、南极探险等领域也作出了自己的贡献，……大学生们利用课外时间，积极参加公益劳动，每年暑假都有数十万人志愿奔赴西伯利亚、远东和北极地带等地区的工地。有的还到商店、旅馆当售货员、清洁工、服务员等。他们的行动既支援了国家建设，也增加了个人收入，减轻了家庭负担。在亚美尼亚的抗震救灾中，苏联各族青年纷纷为伤员献血，参加义务劳动为灾区筹款，以及组成建筑突击队为灾民盖房。
    在苏联青年中也有人对改革不理解而感到彷徨，对十月革命７０年来国家所发生的许多不幸事件感到迷惑不解，还有目光短浅，追求个人舒适的小家庭生活的，有的通过不正当的手段获取财富，甚至走上犯罪的道路。有的青年在恋爱婚姻或工作问题上不顺心就沉湎于酗酒、吸毒，甚至轻生。近年来，苏联平均每年有五六万人自杀，其中相当的一部分是青年。女青年中也有好逸恶劳者，靠卖淫为生，个别的因此染上了艾滋病。
    在今天的苏联，年轻家庭“多冲突，不稳固”已成为一个社会问题。据官方统计，１９８６年，全国平均１０００对夫妇中有３４７对离婚；１９８７年有９５３．１万个家庭破裂。大城市的离婚率高达５０％。
    在苏联青年中，这些不良倾向在蔓延，不少人因此离开了共青团，共青团的人数已由１９８５年的４２００万减少到１９８８年的３８００万。
    　苏联政府和共青团等组织对上述情况已表示出极大的关注。
