Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, March 8th.

The venue for this summer's World University Games remains undecided. The World University Sports Federation held an executive committee meeting in Sofia today to discuss the relocation of the 1989 Summer University Games due to Brazil's withdrawal from hosting the event.

According to the chairman of the World University Sports Federation's executive committee, Primo Nebiolo, the 1989 Summer University Games, scheduled to be held in August, cannot be confirmed at this time. The Brazilian government has decided to withdraw from hosting due to financial reasons, and the Bulgarian government has also expressed its inability to host due to financial constraints. Therefore, the location for this summer's World University Games is still uncertain. However, Nebiolo hopes to finalize the relocation issue by the end of this month.

Nebiolo revealed at the press conference that, based on the current situation, the World University Sports Federation may be able to persuade the West German government to host the games in a city that has previously hosted the Olympics.

　　今夏世界大学生运动会会址仍待定
    新华社索非亚三月八日电  （记者王金柏）世界大学生体联今天在索非亚举行了执委会会议，讨论由于巴西放弃承办一九八九年夏季大学生运动会而引起的这届世界大学生运动会易址举行问题。
    据世界大学生体联执委会主席普里莫·内比奥罗今天下午在新闻发布会上宣布，预定于今年八月举行的一九八九年世界大学生夏季运动会，由于巴西政府提出因财政原因决定放弃承办权，保加利亚政府也表示了由于财政原因无力承办的立场，所以，今年夏天的世界大学生运动会在何地举行，目前还不能确定。但是内比奥罗希望能在本月内最后确定今年夏季大学生运动会的易址问题。
    内比奥罗在记者招待会上透露，据目前情况看，世界大学生体联有可能说服联邦德国政府，请联邦德国举办过奥运会的城市承办。
