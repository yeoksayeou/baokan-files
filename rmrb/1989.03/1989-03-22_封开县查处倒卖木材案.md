Your newspaper published on January 18, on the fifth page, a letter from a reader titled "When Will This 'Flipping' Stop?" and a reporter's investigation report titled "The Central-South Company's Network of Illegal Timber Sales." These reports exposed the involvement of our county's Five Metals and Electrical Appliances Company in illegal timber sales. The county Party committee and government attached great importance to this issue and immediately decided to have the deputy county magistrate in charge of finance, commerce, and legal affairs convene relevant responsible persons to investigate and handle the case. Now, the 790,000 yuan illegally gained by the Five Metals and Electrical Appliances Company from selling timber has been fully confiscated. Relevant departments will seriously deal with the persons responsible for the illegal timber sales.
