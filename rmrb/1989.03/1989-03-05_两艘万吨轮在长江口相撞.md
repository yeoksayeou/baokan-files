Two 10,000-ton ships collided in the Yangtze River estuary at Duck Mouth Sand waterway this morning.

According to reports, the two colliding ships were a 20,000-ton coal carrier "An Yuan" fully loaded by the Shanghai Maritime Bureau and a 10,000-ton container ship "Bo Ku Yi" of the Polish Ocean Lines. At the time of the collision, the bow of "Bo Ku Yi" was embedded in the hull of "An Yuan" between the third and fourth holds, causing the ship to take on a large amount of water.

After the collision, Shanghai salvage and port authorities worked closely together to organize the rescue. The two ships ran aground in nearby waters, clearing the waterway. By 11:41 AM, the tightly locked "Bo Ku Yi" and "An Yuan" had separated. The bow of "Bo Ku Yi" was partially damaged, while "An Yuan" was more severely damaged.

According to the Shanghai Maritime Safety Supervision Bureau, the cause of the collision is currently unknown, and the extent of the damage is difficult to estimate at this time.

　　两艘万吨轮在长江口相撞
    据新华社上海３月４日电  （记者冯亦珍）今天上午，两艘万吨级货轮在长江口鸭窝沙航槽水域相撞。
    据悉，两艘相撞的货轮，一艘是上海海运局满载的两万吨级煤轮“安源”号，另一艘是中波轮船公司的万吨级集装箱船“波库依”轮。相撞时，“波库依”轮的船首嵌入“安源”轮三至四舱的船体内，货轮大量进水。
    两船相撞后，上海救捞、港务等单位紧密配合组织抢救，两船在附近水域冲滩搁浅，让出航槽。到上午１１时４１分，紧紧咬住的“波库依”轮与“安源”轮已分离。“波库依”轮的船首部分破损，“安源”轮损坏较严重。
    据上海海上安全监督局介绍，目前两船相撞的原因不明，损失暂时也难以估算。
