Xinhua News Agency, Panmunjom, March 28th.

North and South Korea's sports delegations today held their second round of talks in Panmunjom to discuss forming a unified team for the 1990 Beijing Asian Games. They agreed to use a map of the Korean Peninsula as the design for their team flag.

During the first round of talks on March 9, both sides reached an agreement on the team anthem. Today, after three hours of negotiations, they agreed to use a single-colored map of the Korean Peninsula without any text as the flag design. However, they have not yet decided on the color to be used.

Regarding the selection of athletes and team formation, the North originally proposed selecting the best athletes through joint training to form a unified team. The number of athletes and the leadership should be determined based on principles that promote national harmony and unity. The South, however, suggested first selecting athletes through competitions and then conducting joint training. The team with more selected athletes should provide the main leadership.

Today, both sides agreed in principle to first conduct joint training and then hold selection matches. However, details on how to train, how to compete, and how to form the team have not been finalized.

Regarding the name of the unified team, both sides have not yet reached a consensus.

Both sides agreed to hold their third round of talks on April 18 at the Peace House on the South's side of Panmunjom.

　　朝鲜北南双方就队旗队歌达成协议
    新华社板门店３月２８日电  （记者朱克川）朝鲜北方和南方的体育代表团今天在板门店就统一组队参加明年北京亚运会而举行第二次会谈时，同意以朝鲜半岛地图为队旗的图案。
    在３月９日举行的第一次会谈中，双方就统一队的队歌问题达成了协议。今天，双方代表经过３个小时会谈，同意以没有任何文字标志的单一颜色的朝鲜半岛地图为队旗图案，但是尚未确定采用哪种颜色。
    在选拔运动员和组队问题上，北方原来主张通过共同训练选拔最优秀的运动员组成统一队，人数和负责人应该根据有利于民族和睦与团结的原则确定；南方则认为，应首先通过比赛选拔运动员，然后进行共同训练，入选运动员多的一方派出该队的主要负责人。
    今天，双方只就先进行共同训练后进行选拔赛这一原则达成协议。如何训练、如何比赛和如何组队问题尚无结果。
    关于统一队的名称，双方尚未取得一致意见。
    双方商定，４月１８日在板门店南方一侧的和平之家举行第三次会谈。
