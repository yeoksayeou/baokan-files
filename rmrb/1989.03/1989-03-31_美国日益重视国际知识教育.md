The United States is increasingly valuing international knowledge education.

	“Is China big?”
	“China is bigger than the United States.”
	“Really? I always thought the United States was the largest country in the world, and China was just very populous.”
	“Actually, Canada is also larger than the United States.”
	“What did you say? Canada? I thought Canada was part of the United States!”

This isn't American humor; it's a conversation the reporter had with the owner and instructor of a driving school in Washington, D.C.

At a recent press conference held at the Washington Foreign Correspondents' Club, a reporter heard an American journalist ask a young Canadian who was studying management at Disney World, "What impression do you have of the United States?" He replied without hesitation, "That's the fact that almost all Americans think we Canadians are just like them."

Americans who know little about the outside world are not uncommon. In a recent Gallup poll of adults, 43% couldn't locate France on a map; 66% couldn't point out Greece; 89% didn't know where Romania was; and 45% couldn't even locate their own state of New York. In a survey of 5,000 high school students in seven major cities, 40% of those in Boston couldn't name the six states in the New England region, even though Boston is in one of them.

This situation has caused concern among many enlightened individuals in the political and economic spheres. Many people believe that the development of the U.S. economy depends to a large extent on the international market. U.S. exports account for 9% of the country's total output; for every $10 billion in goods and services exported, 25,000 jobs are created domestically; half of the income of the 23 largest U.S. banks comes from overseas. From the 1990s to the next century, mutual dependence and penetration among countries will be a major trend in the global economy, and all countries will maximize the use of foreign trade to achieve domestic economic growth. However, Virginia Governor L. Douglas Wilder warned, "We do not understand the languages, cultures, and geographical features of our competitors," and the lack of international knowledge among Americans will affect the international competitiveness of U.S. products, thereby weakening the United States' international status.

To change this situation, the U.S. education sector is currently placing great emphasis on international knowledge education, and a wave of learning foreign languages and world geography and history is sweeping through elementary and secondary schools across the country: the number of students learning foreign languages in Wisconsin has reached its highest level since World War I; in Florida, 100,000 elementary school students are learning foreign languages; New York State requires all ninth and tenth graders to study foreign history and culture; 44% of middle school students in Virginia are learning foreign languages, the highest proportion in the country.

However, many governors believe that these efforts are far from sufficient. A working group led by New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean has recently proposed a series of new suggestions to improve national international knowledge education:

	• Include international knowledge, including foreign languages and world geography, in the compulsory curriculum for the earliest grades of elementary school;
	• Require every college graduate to be proficient in a foreign language and familiar with the cultures of other countries;
	• Create opportunities for teachers to study international knowledge;
	• Encourage businesses and residents to increase their support for international knowledge education;
	• Help businesses obtain more information about export markets, trade rules, and foreign cultures.

### 美国日益重视国际知识教育

　　美国日益重视国际知识教育
    本报记者  仓立德
    “中国大吗？”
    “中国比美国大。”
    “真的？我一直以为美国是世界上最大的国家，中国只是人多而已。”
    “其实加拿大面积也比美国大。”
    “你说什么？加拿大？我还以为加拿大是美国的一部分呢！”
    这可不是美国式幽默，而是记者学开车时，与华盛顿一家驾驶员训练公司老板兼教练的一段对话。
    在华盛顿外国记者中心不久前举行的一次新闻发布会上，记者听到一位美国记者问一个到迪斯尼世界学习经营管理的加拿大小伙子：“你对美国什么印象最深？”他不假思索地答道：“那就是几乎所有美国人都认为我们加拿大人跟他们没什么两样。”
    对外界情况知之甚少的美国人并非绝无仅有。在最近对成年人的一次盖洛普民意测验中，４３％的人在地图上找不到法国；６６％的人指不出希腊的位置；８９％的人不知罗马尼亚在何处；４５％的人竟然连本国的纽约州在哪里也不甚了了。在一项对７大城市５０００名高中学生的调查中，波士顿４０％的被调查者说不出新英格兰地区６个州的名称，而波士顿所在的州恰恰便是其中之一。
    这种状况引起政界、经济界许多有识之士的忧虑。不少人认为，美国经济发展在很大程度上依赖国际市场。美国的出口值占全国总产值的９％，每出口价值１０亿美元的商品和劳务，便意味着在国内增加２．５万个就业机会；美国２３家最大银行有一半收入来自海外。从９０年代到下个世纪，各国相互依赖、相互渗透将是世界经济发展的大趋势，各国都将最大限度地利用对外贸易来实现国内经济的增长。然而，弗吉尼亚州州长拉尔德·贝利尔斯警告说，“对于我们的竞争对手，我们既不懂它们的语言和文化，也不知道它们的地理特征”，美国人国际知识的贫乏将影响美国产品的国际竞争力，进而削弱美国的国际地位。
    为改变这种状况，目前美国教育界十分重视国际知识教育，一股学习外语及世界地理、历史的热潮正在全国各州中、小学兴起：威斯康星州学外语的学生人数已达到第一次世界大战以来的最高峰；在佛罗里达州，小学生学外语的人数已有１０万名；纽约州规定所有初三、高一学生必须学习外国历史和文化；弗吉尼亚州的中学生有４４％都在学外语，比例高居全国之首。
    然而，许多州长都认为上述努力还远远不够。以新泽西州州长托马斯·基恩为首的工作组近来还就改进全国国际知识教育问题提出了一系列新建议：
    ——将国际知识，包括外国语和世界地理，列入小学最低年级的必修课；
    ——规定每个大学毕业生必须通晓一门外语，并熟悉其他国家的文化；
    ——为教师进修国际知识创造机会；
    ——企业和居民增加对国际知识教育的资助。
    ——帮助企业界获得更多有关出口市场、外贸规则及外国文化的信息。
