The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's Propaganda Department article states:
To Treat Public Sentiment as the First Signal

The article states that carefully listening to the voices of the people and understanding their sentiments ensures that all decisions and measures align with the will of the people, gaining their support and approval. This is a fundamental requirement of the Party's mass line and an important aspect of leadership. The article states that any decision or measure must align with public sentiment and meet the aspirations of the people; otherwise, if public sentiment is low or even hostile, the matter cannot be successfully handled. Public sentiment often reflects the people's feelings, understanding, and attitudes towards various social phenomena in real life. To ensure that all our decisions and measures align with the aspirations and demands of the people, leaders should treat public sentiment as the first signal and timely grasp the public sentiment.

	To Place Corporate Culture in a More Important Position

	In the first issue of 1989, the magazine "Method" published an article by Gong Yu Zhi, which states that an enterprise itself represents a new culture. In particular, a socialist modern enterprise undoubtedly represents a new culture, with advanced productive forces, advanced science and technology, an advanced working class, advanced management, a demand for advanced and broad social connections, and a new mode of operation. It exists as a culture in society.

	The new culture represented by advanced enterprises also requires a broader cultural background and environment that matches it. A cultural ideology of small-scale and backward production is incompatible with this, so coordination is needed. The direction of coordination is to make our entire cultural environment overcome all backward elements and develop towards modernity. This process requires a new cultural environment, and the overall cultural environment of society should promote the better and healthier development of enterprises, making the development of enterprises and the overall culture mutually beneficial.

	The discussion of culture should be broader, and corporate culture should be placed in a more important position. This is the more practical significance of cultural discussion.

	Qin Benli Discusses:

	The Responsibility of the Media and How to Gain Trust

	On January 31, Qin Benli, the editor-in-chief of "World Economic Herald," discussed some fundamental issues of the media with Larry Murphy, the executive chairman of the World Media Association, and public relations manager John Robbins in Washington. He said: For any media to gain the trust of the public, it must do the following three things: First, tell the truth, be honest, and report the facts as they are to the readers, seeking truth from facts; second, have diverse voices, that is, publish various different and even opposing ideas and viewpoints, not just reflecting the government's voice but more importantly, reflecting the people's voice, allowing people to make independent judgments about national affairs based on facts; third, protect those speeches that are fundamentally beneficial to reform and opening up, and to mobilize and inspire people's enthusiasm, and provide ample opportunities for those who want to speak but dare not or have no chance to speak, especially intellectuals. The greatest responsibility of the media is to promote the development of human civilization and social progress, enabling people to fully enjoy democracy and freedom and live a happier life. Specifically, for China's current reality, it is to help promote the smooth and healthy development of China's reform and opening-up cause, which is the only way forward for China.

　　新视角
　　中共天津市委宣传部文章说：
    要把群众情绪作为第一信号
    文章说，细心地倾听群众呼声，体察群众的情绪，使一切决策和措施符合人民群众的意愿，博得群众的拥护和支持，这是党的群众路线的根本要求，也是重要的领导艺术。文章说，任何决策或措施，都必须顺应群众情绪，符合群众愿望；否则，群众情绪不高，甚至气呼呼，事情就不可能办好。群众情绪往往反映群众对现实生活中各种社会现象的感受、认识和态度，为了使我们的一切决策和措施都符合群众的愿望和要求，从领导的角度来说，就应当把群众情绪作为第一信号，及时把握群众情绪。

　　龚育之提出：
    把企业文化摆在更重要的位置上
    《方法》杂志一九八九年第一期发表的龚育之的谈话说，企业本身代表一种新的文化。特别是社会主义现代化企业，无疑代表一种新的文化，有先进的生产力，有先进的科学技术，有先进的工人阶级，有先进的经营管理，有一种要求先进的、广阔的社会联系，有一种新的运转方式，它本身就作为一种文化在社会上存在。
    先进企业代表的新文化也需要有一个与它相适应的更广阔的文化背景和环境。一个小生产落后环境的文化思想观念，与之格格不入，这就要做协调工作。协调的方向就是要使我们整个文化环境能够克服一切落后的东西，向现代方向发展。这一过程要求有一个新的文化环境，而整个社会的文化环境应当促使企业发展得更好、更健康，使企业的发展和整个文化的发展互相促进。
    应当把文化的讨论搞得更宽阔一些，把企业文化摆在更重要的位置上，这是文化讨论更实在的意义。
　　钦本立谈：
    传播媒介的责任和怎样取得信赖
    《世界经济导报》总编辑钦本立一月三十一日在华盛顿与世界传播媒介协会执行主席莱里·默菲特和公共关系经理约翰·罗宾斯讨论传播媒介的一些基本问题时说：任何传播媒介要想取得大众对它的信赖，都必须做到如下三点：一是讲真话，讲实话，把事实原原本本地告诉读者，实事求是；二是要有多种声音，即同时发表各种不同的、甚至相对立的思想与观点，不仅要反映政府的声音，更要反映人民的声音，让人们根据事实独立地对国家大事做出判断；第三，要保护那些从根本上有利于改革与开放、有利于调动和激发人们的积极性的言论，要给那些想讲话而不敢讲话或没有机会讲的人、特别是知识分子提供充分讲话的机会。传播媒介的最大责任就是有助于推动人类文明的发展和社会的进步，使人民充分享受民主与自由，过上更幸福的生活。具体到中国目前的实际，就是要有助于推动中国的改革与开放事业更顺利、更健康地发展，这是中国唯一的出路。
