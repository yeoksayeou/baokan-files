Some farmers do not want to deposit their money in the bank, thinking that keeping it at home is safer. However, due to poor management, they end up suffering losses.

Last February, a farmer in our county took 2,450 yuan in cash to buy tractor parts. Since the parts were not available, he returned home disappointed. Back home, he wrapped the cash in a cloth and placed it in an unused iron stove. That afternoon, guests came to his house, and his wife lit the stove to cook, not bothering to check what was inside. As a result, over 2,000 yuan in cash turned to ashes.

Another farmer in our county wrapped 500 yuan in biscuit paper and placed it in a drawer. When he went to retrieve it, he found that it had been chewed to pieces by rats.

A villager in Hanwang Township of our county sold apples for 1,500 yuan in 1985. At that time, he deposited 1,300 yuan in the bank and kept 200 yuan for spending. Upon returning home, he wrapped the deposit slip and the 200 yuan in cash together and stuffed them into a crack in the roof beam. Unfortunately, during the rainy summer, the humidity in the house caused the deposit slip and the cash to rot. When he discovered this, he rushed to the Agricultural Bank branch. The bank staff, based on the information he provided about the deposit time, name, and address, found the record of his deposit. After verification, the 1,300 yuan deposit slip was valid, and the bank staff immediately processed the replacement for him. The 200 yuan in cash, however, was too rotten to be recognized, so he had to accept the loss.

The above examples illustrate that it is better to deposit money in the bank promptly. This benefits both the country and the individual. Why not do it?

### 钱还是存入银行好

　　钱还是存入银行好
    一些农民有钱不愿存银行，以为钱在自己手里才保险。结果保管不善，反使自己受害。
    去年２月的一天，我县一农民拿着２４５０元现金去买拖拉机零部件，因缺货扫兴而归。回到家里，他用一块布把现金如数包好，放到闲置的铁炉子里。当天下午，他家中来了客人，他的妻子便点燃那只铁炉支锅炒菜，急忙中也顾不得查看，结果２０００多元现金化为灰烬。我县另一农民用饼干纸包起５００元现金放在抽屉里，待取用时发现已被老鼠咬成了一堆碎屑。
    我县韩旺乡有一村民，１９８５年卖苹果收入１５００元。当时，他存入银行１３００元，留下２００元准备零花。回到家后，他把存款单和２００元现金包在一起，塞在屋梁的缝中。谁知夏季阴雨连绵，屋内潮湿，加上疏忽，１３００元的存单和２００元现金全部烂掉了。他发现后急忙跑到农业银行营业所，营业所的同志根据他提供的存款时间、姓名、住址等线索，查到了他的存款单留底。经核实，那张１３００元的存款单有效，农行营业所的同志当即给他补办了手续。２００元现金由于霉烂严重，无法辨认，只好自认晦气。
    以上几个事例说明，有钱还是及时存入银行好，这样做既利国又利己，何乐而不为呢！
