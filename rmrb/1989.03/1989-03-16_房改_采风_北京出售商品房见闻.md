Housing has always been a headache for urban residents. For the residents of Beijing, the capital, this problem is even more pronounced. Since the housing reform measures were introduced, "commercial housing" has become a hot topic among Beijing residents.

	Longing for a Home

Xiao Liu, 29, works in the Electrical Equipment Development Department of the Municipal Power Supply and Distribution Company. His wife is an accountant at another unit, and they have a 4-year-old daughter. Although they live in a one-bedroom apartment, they are content with their situation. However, when a commercial housing building, 305, was constructed near their residence in the Xiluoyuan residential area, he was tempted. If he could buy a unit here for his aging parents, it would not only improve their living conditions but also make it convenient for mutual visits.

On the afternoon of February 27, Xiao Liu rushed to the Municipal Real Estate Trading Center across from the North Gate of Tian Tan. He hurried to the second-floor hall. In front of the "First Batch of Commercial Housing Prices" posted on the north wall, he stood still.

At this moment, I approached him for a chat. He said, "I can only look at the building and sigh! The 305 building has the worst floor and orientation, but each square meter still costs 1,600 yuan. Buying a two-bedroom apartment with a building area of 56.44 square meters would cost nearly 90,000 yuan. He said, "According to our reliable income, it would take 80 years to buy a two-bedroom apartment for the elderly!" He patted his black leather jacket and glanced sideways at the purchase registration office, then left.

	Eager Buyers

"Please give me a housing purchase registration form!"

"Comrade! We have been registering for days now, when can we pay the housing purchase fee?"

Several people gathered around the table at the housing purchase registration office.

"You can register and wait," the female staff member at the Municipal Real Estate Trading Center replied to a young couple's inquiry, "When to pay the housing purchase fee, please wait for the notice."

A woman with long hair, wearing a red wool coat, retorted, "Once the payment is made, I will feel at ease!"

In the first-floor hall of the trading center, I met Ma Jinlin, the 56-year-old director of the center. He introduced that this first batch of commercial housing for sale totals 20,000 square meters, equivalent to 350 units. The price per square meter ranges from 1,600 to 1,900 yuan (based on the building area). Director Ma also sighed, saying the price is quite high. Why so high? He explained that the infrastructure costs around these commercial buildings, such as roads, schools, and shops, are not covered by the state, and the local government cannot afford them, so they have to be included in the housing price; otherwise, the housing development department cannot build houses. After taking office, Old Ma opened the center with a trial sales mindset. Unexpectedly, in just half a month, these 350 units were "reserved" for 320 units.

From their funding sources, there are several types: those who receive assistance from overseas relatives, those who receive substantial economic compensation after being exonerated of false, wrong, or mistaken cases, those with inherited family wealth, a few retired or retired technical personnel with significant profits in collective or private enterprises, a few wealthy individual business owners, and some who borrow from relatives and friends to buy a house. There are also a few writers, famous actors, and well-known figures.

	Various Forms

Opening the commercial housing market to society is not the only model for Beijing's housing reform. The city is also experimenting with internal commercial housing markets in 10 relatively large enterprises and institutions. Beijing Heavy Machinery Factory is one of the 10 pilot units.

The factory has a total of 100,000 square meters of self-owned housing, but it can only collect 98,000 yuan in rent per year. However, the annual maintenance and management costs for these self-owned houses amount to over 600,000 yuan.

To find a way to both build houses and reduce maintenance and management costs, Factory Director Wu Zongjiang proposed the "sales and rentals coexist, voluntary participation" housing reform policy. With the approval of the factory's labor congress and the municipal housing reform office, they implemented this policy by selling 3,000 square meters of newly built housing. The sales targets are 112 households of employees who have reached the factory's housing allocation limit. The sales price combines the internal price of the enterprise and the preferential price for length of service; the price per square meter ranges from 210 to 357 yuan. Employees with more than 20 years of service can buy at the lower price. The enterprise guarantees a 5-year warranty for the sold houses.

By early March, of the 112 households eligible to buy, 60 had registered to "reserve" a unit. To be honest, although the enterprise's internal housing price is much lower than that of the trading center, it is still not in line with the income of state-owned enterprise employees.

For the 52 households that did not register to "reserve" a unit, the factory also has a plan: they will rent out the "second-hand" houses vacated by the buyers to them. This way, the factory also stabilizes the emotions of these 52 households.

### “房改”采风——北京出售商品房见闻

　　“房改”采风
    ——北京出售商品房见闻
    本报记者  张书政
    住房，向来就是城里人头痛的事儿。对首都北京的居民来说，这个问题就更突出了。自从住房改革的措施出台之后，“商品房”可就成了北京人的热门话题。
    　　　　望房兴叹
    小刘，２９岁，在市送变电公司的电工机具开发部工作。其妻是某单位会计，有一个４岁女儿。虽住一居室，倒也安于现状。可是，当他们住处附近的西罗园住宅小区盖起一栋３０５号商品楼时，他动了心。要是能在这里给年迈的父母购一套房，一来改善他们的生活条件，二来方便互相的来往，该多好！
    ２月２７日下午，小刘来到天坛北门对面的市房地产交易所，急步二楼大厅。在北墙挂的《第一批商品房售价表》前，他愣住了。
    这时，我上前与他攀谈。他说：“我只能望楼兴叹！３０５号楼楼层和朝向是条件最差的，每平方米也得１６００元，买个二居室，建筑面积５６．４４平方米，要付近９万元。他说：“按我家可靠收入数计算，得８０年后才能给老人买上二居室！”他拍拍黑皮夹克衣襟，向购房登记处乜斜一眼，走了。
    　　　　购房心切者
    “请给我一张购房登记表！”
    “同志！我们都登记好几天啦，购房款什么时候交哇？”
    几个人围在购房登记处的桌子前。
    “你们登完记就等着吧！”市房地产交易所女工作人员回答一对青年夫妇的问话时说：“什么时候交购房款，请听通知。”
    秀发披肩，穿红色呢大衣的少妇反馈一句：“交了款，心里就踏实了！”
    在交易所一楼大厅，我见到了５６岁的交易所马金林所长，他介绍说，这次出售的第一批商品房，共计２万平方米，合３５０套。每平方米售价１６００—１９００元（指建筑面积）。马所长也感叹，售价够高的。为什么这么高，他说，这些商品楼附近的道路、学校、商店等市政建设费用国家不管，地方政府拿不起，只好摊入房价；否则，房屋开发部门无法建房。老马就任所长后，带着试售的心情开张了。没想到，开张仅仅半个月，这３５０套房子居然被“认购”了３２０套。
    从他们的资金来源上分，有这样几类：得到国外亲友资助的人。平反冤假错案时得到较多经济补偿的人。有祖传家财的人。
    少数离、退休后在集体或私人企业里有巨额盈利的技术人员。少数发了财的个体户。也有人在亲友中东拆西借、七拼八凑地集资买房。极少数作家、名演员、知名人士等。
    　　　　多种形式
    向社会开放商品房市场，并非北京“房改”的唯一模式，该市在１０个比较大的企事业单位中，试行着单位内部的商品房市场。北京重型机器厂就是这１０家试点单位之一。
    “北重机”自有房屋建筑面积１０万平方米，一年只能收缴９．８万元房租，而这些自有房屋每年投入的维修和管理费用竟达６０多万元。
    为寻找一个既要建房、又能减少维修和管理房屋费用的路子，厂长吴宗江提出了“售、租并举，坚持自愿”的“房改”方针。经厂职代会和市“房改办”批准，他们按这一方针，将新建的３０００平方米房屋出售。售房对象是，已进入企业分房界限的１１２户职工，售房价格，实行企业内部价和工龄优惠价相结合；一平方米在２１０元至３５７元之间。２０年以上工龄的职工买，按低价算。房屋售出后，企业保修５年。
    至３月初，该厂１１２户售房对象中，已有６０户登记“认购”。说实在的，虽说企业内部房价比交易所低得多，但与国营职工收入仍不协调。
    对于没有登记“认购”的那５２户职工，厂里也有个安排，准备把购房户腾出来的“二流房”租给他们；厂里这样做，也安定了这５２户职工的情绪。
