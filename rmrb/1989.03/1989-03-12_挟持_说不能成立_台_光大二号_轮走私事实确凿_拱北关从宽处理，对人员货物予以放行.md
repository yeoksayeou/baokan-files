The "hijacking" claim cannot stand. The facts of the Taiwan "Guangda No. 2" ship's smuggling are clear. The Hong Kong Customs have handled the case leniently, allowing the personnel and cargo to pass.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on March 11, a spokesperson for the General Administration of Customs stated today that the Taiwan "Guangda No. 2" cargo ship's illegal smuggling of cigarettes is a confirmed fact. The Hong Kong Customs, in accordance with the "Customs Law," have handled the case leniently, seizing all the smuggled cigarettes, and allowing the ship's personnel and cargo to pass.

The spokesperson said that in recent days, the Taiwanese media have extensively reported on the case of the Hong Kong Customs seizing the Taiwan cargo ship "Guangda No. 2." Some reports claim that the ship had "no contraband" and was "hijacked" by the Hong Kong Customs to Zhuhai. This claim is contrary to the facts. The fact is that, in addition to loading ceramics and scrap iron, the ship also carried 4,760 boxes of foreign cigarettes from Hong Kong. On the early morning of March 3, it entered the waters of Danggan Island in Zhuhai City and was seized by the Hong Kong Customs' anti-smuggling vessel.

According to Article 49, Paragraph 1, Item (2) of the "Customs Law of the People's Republic of China" and Article 7, Paragraph 1, Item (2) of the "Supplementary Provisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the Punishment of Smuggling Crimes," transporting and selling goods that are restricted from entering and exiting the country in our internal and territorial waters, with a significant amount and without legal proof, should be treated as smuggling. The Hong Kong Customs' seizure of the "Guangda No. 2" is in accordance with the law. The relevant parties have admitted to the smuggling facts and acknowledged that they have violated the law.

　　“挟持”说不能成立
    台“光大二号”轮走私事实确凿   
    拱北关从宽处理，对人员货物予以放行
    据新华社北京３月１１日电  海关总署发言人今天指出，台湾“光大二号”货轮违法走私香烟事实确凿，拱北海关依据《海关法》予以从宽处理，没收全部走私香烟，对货轮人员及所载货物予以放行。
    这位发言人说，近日来，台湾新闻界以大量篇幅报道我拱北海关缉获台湾货轮“光大二号”一案，有些报道称该船“绝无违禁品”，是被我海关“挟持”到珠海的。这种说法是违背事实的。事实是，该船从香港除装载瓷土、废铁等货物外，还载有４７６０箱外国香烟，于３月３日凌晨驶入我珠海市担杆岛海域被我拱北海关缉私艇缉获。根据《中华人民共和国海关法》第四十九条第一款第（二）项和《全国人大常委会关于惩治走私罪的补充规定》第七条第一款第（二）项的规定：在我内海、领海运输、贩卖国家限制进出口的货物，数额较大，没有合法证明的，应按走私罪论处。拱北海关查扣“光大二号”轮，是依法执行职务。有关当事人对走私事实已供认不讳，承认触犯法律。
