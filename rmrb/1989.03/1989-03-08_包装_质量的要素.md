Packaging—An Element of Quality

Reporter Gù Yàomíng

Paying attention to packaging is a distinctive feature of Danish products. The reporter visited the Danish Packaging and Transport Research Institute, located in the western suburbs of Copenhagen. The institute has only 40 staff members working in a small red-brick building. However, this work is increasingly valued by Danish enterprises and companies.

"Packaging is not just about external decoration; it also plays a protective role during the transportation of products. Additionally, it must prevent light, gas, and odors. Our work involves researching the most reasonable, economical, and effective packaging and transportation methods for products from the time they leave the factory until they reach the hands of the user," said the institute's director, Haagen-Petterson, pointing to various exhibits in the display room. When the institute was first established, it had only 8 people. With the development of the Danish economy and the increasing importance of packaging technology, the institute has seen rapid growth.

Petterson took out a few newly designed packaging boxes and said, "The design of the packaging exterior should not cost too much, but it should attract customers through style and color, and it should also be convenient to use." To design these packaging boxes, the institute repeatedly studied customer psychology, making numerous comparisons and modifications before finalizing the design. The designers placed samples on supermarket shelves to observe how attractive they were to customers and whether customers understood the product's content and usage from the packaging's instructions and illustrations. The institute believes that the quality of the packaging exterior will play a crucial role in the product's position on the market shelves.

The packaging requirements for pharmaceuticals are very high and are a key area of research. It must be convenient to use and resistant to high temperatures, cold, and humidity. For example, to ensure that the packaging of medicines prevents children from easily opening and ingesting them while also being convenient for the elderly and infirm to use, the institute designed some medicine bottles. They took these bottles to kindergartens to observe how long it took children to open them and sent them to nursing homes for the elderly to try opening, until the design was perfect. The reporter saw in the exhibition hall that some medicine bottle caps needed to be pressed first, while others needed to be turned in a clockwise direction and then counterclockwise before they could be opened.

Food packaging is also very meticulous. The institute has solved several problems through multiple experiments, such as preventing fish and meat from absorbing each other's odors during transportation; ensuring that apples and tomatoes do not cause the apples to produce ethylene, which softens the tomatoes; preventing fresh flowers and vegetables from affecting the color of the flowers; and maintaining the freshness of roasted meats and grilled chickens as they leave the factory.

Reducing the damage to goods during transportation has been a research focus of the institute since 1983. The reporter visited the institute's computer simulation laboratory and saw some cardboard packaging boxes undergoing simulated tests of vibration, compression, falling, and hard impacts during transportation. Here, they also conduct tests for frost resistance, heat resistance, and artificial rain. The institute has installed black boxes in some transport vehicles to record the vehicle's running conditions, observing the degree of shaking under different conditions, and thus designing reasonable packaging.

"Rational integration of packaging, production, and transportation can protect the quality of products and save a lot of money," emphasized Director Petterson. He believes that the ideal situation is to consider packaging design simultaneously when designing new products. For example, a power supply unit of an electrical appliance was originally installed on the side of the appliance, which made packaging difficult and did not prevent collisions. If it is installed at the bottom of the appliance, it can protect the product and save packaging costs. The institute conducted a sample survey of 7 large Danish enterprises and found that the rational integration of packaging and transportation can save Danish enterprises more than 7 billion Danish kroner annually.

### 包装—质量的要素

　　包装—质量的要素
    本报记者  顾耀铭
    注重包装是丹麦产品的一大特色，记者采访了座落在哥本哈根市西郊的丹麦包装和运输研究所。该所仅有工作人员４０名，在一幢红砖小楼里办公。然而，这项工作越来越受到丹麦企业和公司的重视。
    “包装不仅仅是外表装饰，而且在产品运输过程中要起保护作用，此外还要防光、防气、防味，我们的工作是研究产品从离开厂家到用户手里全过程的最合理、经济和有效的包装及运输方法。”研究所总经理哈根门·彼特森指着陈列室里的各种展品对记者说。这个所刚建立时只有８个人，随着丹麦经济的发展和包装技术日益受到重视，该所得到迅速发展。
    彼特森拿出几个新设计的包装盒，说：“包装的外表设计既不能花费太多的资金，又要通过款式和色彩吸引顾客，还要使用方便。”为设计这些包装盒，研究所反复研究顾客心理，经过多次比较修改后才定型。设计人员曾将样品放在超级市场的货架上，观察它对顾客究竟有多少吸引力，顾客看了包装上的说明和图案后对产品的内容和用途是否明白。研究所认为，包装外表的好坏，对于商品在市场货架上占据的位置将起重要作用。
    医药用品的包装要求很高，是研究的重点。它既要使用方便，又要耐高温、严寒和潮湿。如，为使药品的包装既能防止儿童轻易打开吞食，又方便体衰病弱的人使用，该所设计了一些药品瓶子，拿到幼儿园，观察孩子花多少时间把瓶子打开，又送到养老院，请老人打开，直到设计得两全其美为止。记者在陈列厅看到有的药瓶盖子要先用手压一下，有的要先往顺时针方向转一圈，再朝逆时针方向转才能打开。
    食品的包装也很考究。研究所经过多次试验，解决了一些难题，如，把鱼和肉放在一起运输时不互相串味；苹果和西红柿放在一起时，不会让苹果产生的乙烯促使西红柿变软；鲜花和蔬菜放在一起，不会影响花的颜色；烤肉、烧鸡能保持刚出厂时的新鲜味道等。
    如何减少运输途中货物受损程度是该所自１９８３年以来一直在研究的课题。记者参观了这个所的计算机模拟试验室，看到一些硬纸包装箱正在经受运输过程中的震动、挤压、坠落、硬撞的模拟试验。在这里还进行抗冻、抗热、受人工雨淋等测试。研究所在一些运输货车内安装了黑盒子，记录路途运行情况，从中观察车辆在不同条件下颠簸的程度，从而设计出合理的包装。
    “包装和生产、运输的合理结合既可以保护产品的质量，又能节约大量资金。”彼特森总经理强调说。他认为最理想的是在设计新产品的时候就把包装设计同时考虑进去。如一个电器的整流器原来安装在电器的侧面，给包装带来困难，不易防止冲撞。如果把它改装在电器的底部，这样既能使产品得到保护，又能节约包装费用。该所曾对７个丹麦的大企业做了抽样统计，数据表明，包装和运输的合理结合可以使全国的企业每年节省７０多亿丹麦克朗。
