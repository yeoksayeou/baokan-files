		In the past, aquaculture was rarely practiced in the rural areas of Helan County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. Recently, however, a unprecedented wave of aquaculture enthusiasm has swept through the county. The total area of water used for fish farming has reached 41,000 mu (approximately 2,733 hectares), and last year's annual production of fresh fish exceeded 15 million kilograms. The county government has not only invested 1.8 million yuan to establish two fish fry hatching points but has also mobilized banks to provide over 4 million yuan in low-interest loans to support specialized households. Additionally, over 4,000 mu of fish ponds have been improved and upgraded for better fish farming.

　　塞北贺兰兴养鱼
    本报讯  过去极少养鱼的宁夏回族自治区贺兰县农村，近来出现空前的养鱼热。全县养鱼水面达４．１万亩，去年年产鲜鱼突破１５０万公斤。县政府不仅拿出１８万元建起两处鱼苗孵化点，而且动员银行拿出４０多万元低息贷款支持专业户，修精养鱼塘４０００多亩。
