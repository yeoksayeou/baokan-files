In September of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Standards and Metrology, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the Municipal Bureau of Machinery and Electronics conducted a spot check on 646 units in Shanghai (mainly individual, collective, and state-owned stores, as well as a small number of factories). They found that 361 units were selling or producing counterfeit, substandard, and uncertified low-voltage electrical equipment. Out of the 1,128 types of low-voltage electrical equipment inspected, 83.2% were found to be counterfeit, substandard, or uncertified products.

The prevalence of counterfeit and substandard low-voltage electrical equipment is particularly severe in the East China and North China regions.

The main sources of these counterfeit and substandard low-voltage electrical equipment are in Wenzhou. In Liuyi Town and Xianlian Market of Leqing County, shops and factories producing and selling counterfeit and substandard low-voltage electrical equipment are numerous. There are as many as 36 shops that print counterfeit brand labels. Apart from a few factories that hold production permits issued by the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, the rest are all producing without certification.

Since 1986, Shanghai enterprises have been allowed to handle their own scrap materials. As a result, they have been buying up batches of discarded electrical equipment at high prices and in cash, often even offering home delivery services. With millions of enterprises in Shanghai and the enormous number of low-voltage electrical equipment discarded each year, counterfeit and substandard product manufacturers have no shortage of raw materials. Additionally, factories producing low-voltage electrical equipment, as well as their supporting and processing plants, have gaps in managing defective products, semi-finished products, components, and labels, providing opportunities for the production of counterfeit and substandard goods.

They divide the collected scrap and substandard low-voltage electrical equipment into two parts. Those that are externally intact are washed with soap water, repainted, and polished with shoe polish, then labeled with a brand. Those that are externally damaged have their silver contacts removed, melted down, and replated with copper contacts, assembled into "high-quality products" using defective and substandard parts.

Some manufacturers also adopt forms such as joint ventures and joint sales with Shanghai businesses to deceive and evade scrutiny. Some factories, stores, wholesale departments, and individual businesses in Shanghai also provide underground warehouses, fake invoices, fake contracts, transportation services, bank accounts, fake factory labels, and fake brand labels for these counterfeit and substandard products. As for the buyers, some are indeed deceived, but most are not unaware; they simply cannot resist the temptation of bribes and kickbacks.

### 假冒、劣质、无证、低压电器面面观

　　假冒、劣质、无证、低压电器面面观
    去年九月份，上海市标准计量局、市工商局和市机电局对上海六百四十六个单位（主要是个体、集体、国营商店和少量工厂）进行抽查，发现三百六十一家出售和生产假冒、劣质、无证低压电器；被抽查的一千一百二十八种低压电器中，假冒、劣质、无证产品竟达百分之八十三点二。
    伪劣低压电器充斥全国尤以华东、华北地区为甚。
    伪劣低压电器主要“出身地”在温州。乐清县柳市镇、仙垟集市，生产、销售伪劣低压电器的店铺、工厂鳞次栉比，仅印制假冒商标标牌的就有三十六家之多，这儿的工厂除极少数持有机电部门颁发的生产许可证外，其余的均为无证生产。
    从一九八六年起，上海各企业可自行处理废旧物资，于是，他们便以高价、现金兼“上门服务”，把成批的废旧电器“收购”到手，上海的企业数以万计，每年报废的低压电器数字大得惊人，伪劣品制造者何愁无“米”下锅。此外，生产低压电器的工厂及其配套厂、加工厂，对生产过程中出现的残次品、半成品、零配件、商标的管理有漏洞，也给伪劣品制造者以可乘之机。
    他们将搜罗来的废次低压电器，分为两部分，表面完好的，用肥皂水洗一洗，再油漆一新，然后用皮鞋油擦一擦，贴上商标；表面残缺的，则取出其中的银触头，然后熔化银子，镀上铜触头，用残次品、劣质品拼凑而成“优质产品”。　　一些厂家还采取与上海厂商联营、联销等形式，瞒天过海。上海的一些工厂、商店、批发部门和个体户还为这些伪劣商品提供地下仓库、代开发票、代订合同、代办运输、提供银行帐号、卖厂牌、卖商标等等。至于购货者一方，有些固然是上当受骗，但多数人并非不清楚，而是经不住贿赂、“回扣”的诱惑。
