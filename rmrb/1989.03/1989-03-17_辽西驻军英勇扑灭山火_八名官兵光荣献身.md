Troops in Liaoxi bravely extinguish major forest fire, eight soldiers sacrifice their lives

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 16 - (Correspondents Ren Yanjun, Xiao Fuheng) 1,400 soldiers from a unit stationed in Liaoxi bravely extinguished a major forest fire, with eight officers and soldiers sacrificing their lives to protect the country's forest resources.

On the morning of March 14, a fire broke out in Kangjia Forest Farm, about 10 kilometers northwest of Jinzhou City, due to farmers burning tree bark. The fire, fueled by an 8-level wind, quickly spread towards the national forest nature reserve and an important military communication hub, threatening three natural villages with nearly a thousand residents who were surrounded by the flames.

Upon hearing the news, the unit immediately dispatched troops to fight the fire. The mountains were high and the forests dense, with strong winds and fierce flames. The soldiers fearlessly engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the inferno. Without water or firefighting equipment, they used tree branches and shovels to beat back the flames. Sharp tree stumps pierced the feet of some soldiers, and the fire singed the clothes, hair, and eyebrows of many, but the soldiers paid no heed. They dug firebreaks around the 20-square-kilometer fire zone.

Deputy Political Instructor Wang Fuxiang led the troops to chase and extinguish the flames approaching the communication hub. Suddenly, the wind direction changed, and the raging fire surrounded the unit. Wang Fuxiang directed the firefighting efforts while organizing the soldiers to break out of the encirclement.

After a 10-hour battle, the fire was extinguished. The three villages, the national forest nature reserve, and the military communication hub were safe, but Wang Fuxiang and seven other officers and soldiers had sacrificed their young lives.

　　辽西驻军英勇扑灭山火
    八名官兵光荣献身
    新华社沈阳３月１６日电  （通讯员任燕军、肖福恒）辽西驻军某部１４００名官兵英勇扑灭特大山火，８名干部、战士为保护国家森林资源光荣献身。
    ３月１４日上午９时，锦州市西北１０公里外的康家林场，因果农焚烧果树皮引起山火。大火在８级大风下迅速扩展，烧向国家林木自然保护区，烧向重要的国防通信枢纽，３个自然村落近千名群众被火蛇包围。
    驻军某部闻讯，立即出动部队扑救。山高林密，风大火猛，官兵们奋不顾身与烈火展开了殊死搏斗。没有水，没有灭火工具，他们就用树枝和铁锹扑打。尖利的树茬穿透了一些战士的脚掌，大火燎着了许多人的衣服、头发、眉毛，指战员们全然不顾。在２０多平方公里的火区四周打起火道。营教导员王福祥带领部队追打逼近通信枢纽的火头。蓦然，风向突变，肆虐的大火团团围住这支部队。王福祥一面指挥打火，一面组织战士突围。
    经过１０个小时的鏖战，大火被扑灭了。３个村庄、国家林木自然保护区和国防通信枢纽安然无恙，而王福祥等８名干部战士却献出了年轻生命。
