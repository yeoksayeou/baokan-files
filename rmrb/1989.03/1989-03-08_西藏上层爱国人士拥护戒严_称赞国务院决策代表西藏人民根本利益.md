Tibetan Upper-Class Patriots Support Martial Law

Praise the State Council's Decision as Representing the Fundamental Interests of the Tibetan People

Today in the evening, the martial law order signed by Premier Li Peng and the order issued by Chairman Duoji Cairang of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Government were broadcast across Lhasa via television. People rushed to tell each other, and the frowns that had been etched on their faces for three days finally relaxed.

Tibetan upper-class patriots, unable to contain their pent-up indignation, expressed their views one after another. Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference, Lama Sengzhu, said: "This is exactly the decision I have been hoping for. It represents the fundamental interests of the Tibetan people."

Famous Tibetan scholar Qia Bai Citanpingcuo said: "The martial law order is very timely. Where it needs to be firm, it must be firm."

Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference, Gongba Sa Duoji Jiaza, told the reporter: "The rioters took advantage of the government's restrained attitude over the past few days, thinking it was weak and exploitable. We cannot let them continue to do as they please."

Today during the day, a small number of separatist elements in Lhasa continued their riotous activities from the previous two days. They beat passersby, looted shops that had already been looted, causing some officials and workers to be unable to go to work, and some primary schools to suspend classes. Vice Chairman of the Tibet Buddhist Association, Cemei Lin Living Buddha, said: "This reminds one of the armed struggles during the Cultural Revolution."

Some residents who had once harbored illusions about "Tibetan independence" saw that the once prosperous and clean streets were now riddled with scars from the rioters, and couldn't help but shake their heads: "Tsk, so this is what 'independence' looks like." It is reported that some residents who participated in the protests were coerced by a small number of separatist elements.

　　西藏上层爱国人士拥护戒严
    称赞国务院决策代表西藏人民根本利益
    本报拉萨３月７日电  记者卢小飞报道：今天傍晚，李鹏总理签署的国务院戒严令和多吉才让主席发布的西藏自治区人民政府令通过电视屏幕传遍拉萨。人们纷纷奔走相告，３天来紧锁的眉头舒展了。
    西藏上层爱国人士按捺不住憋了几天的愤慨，纷纷发表见解。自治区政协副主席拉敏·索朗伦珠说：“这正是我盼望着的决定，它代表了西藏人民的根本利益。”
    著名藏族学者恰白·次坦平措说：“戒严令非常及时，该硬的地方一定要硬起来。”
    自治区政协副主席贡巴萨·土登吉札对记者说：“骚乱分子视政府前几天的克制态度为软弱可欺，决不能再任其为所欲为了。”
    今天白天，拉萨的少数分裂主义分子仍在继续前两日的骚乱活动。他们殴打过往行人，抢劫已被抢劫过的商店，致使一些干部和职工无法上班，一些小学被迫停课。西藏佛协副会长策墨林活佛说：“这使人想起了‘文革’的武斗。”
    一些曾经对“西藏独立”抱有过幻想的居民，看到昔日繁荣整洁的街道如今被骚乱分子弄得满目疮痕，不由摇起了头：“嗐，原来‘独立’就是这个样子的。”据悉，一些参加游行的居民是被极少数分裂主义分子胁迫去的。
