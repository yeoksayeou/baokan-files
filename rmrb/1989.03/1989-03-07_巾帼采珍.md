Women Running a School

In the capital of the Dominican Republic, Santo Domingo, there is a notable girls' home economics school. It was established by a group of volunteer housewives for orphans and abandoned children. The girls here learn embroidery, tailoring, and sewing, as well as hairdressing, flower cultivation, and office administration. The school has been in operation for twenty-five years, transforming many children who were abandoned by society into useful talents. Some graduates have gone on to university, while others have become secretaries or engaged in other professions.

Women-Only Taxis

Japan's taxi services have many problems, and Japanese women have many complaints: "When driving at night, the driver deliberately takes a detour through remote areas..." "For short distances, the driver's arrogance and rudeness are unbearable." To address this, the Daikai Taxi Company in the Hyogo Ward of Kobe City has introduced "women-only taxis." Drivers of these taxis must undergo a professional ethics assessment. These black mid-sized cars have a pink "women-only" sign on the roof. When the driver opens the door for ladies, soothing music plays inside. The interior is carpeted in green and equipped with special services such as a telephone, making it popular among women.

Women's Proposal Day

In the UK, the extra day added in a leap year (February 29th) is designated as "Women's Proposal Day." On this day, women are free from social conventions and can boldly propose to the men they like or to hesitant lovers. In 1288, Scotland passed a law making February 29th "Women's Rights Day," imposing fines on men who chased after women indiscriminately. "Women's Proposal Day" may have originated from this. Currently, men who refuse a woman's proposal on this day either pay one pound as a symbolic "penance" or give silk to the "heartbroken woman."

According to relevant departments, more than 90% of men accept the girls' affections on this day. February 29th has become a day when many British women decide their fate.

　　巾帼采珍
    家庭主妇办学校
    多米尼加首都圣多明各，有一所引人注目的女子家政学校，它是由一批家庭主妇志愿为孤儿和弃儿办起来的。姑娘们在这里学习刺绣、裁剪和缝纫，还学习理发、养花和文秘专业知识。该校创办已二十五年了，把许多被社会抛弃的孩子培养成有用人才，有的毕业生进入大学深造，还有的姑娘当上了秘书或从事其它工作。
    妇女专用出租车
    日本的出租汽车服务存在不少问题，日本妇女对此颇有微词：“当深夜行车时，司机故意驶过偏僻之处……”“对短距离路程，司机的傲慢无礼使人无法忍受。”为此，日本神户市兵库区的大开出租汽车公司设置了“妇女专用出租车”。驾驶这种车的司机需先经过职业道德的考核。这种黑色的中型车，车顶安装有“妇女专用”字样的粉红色标志灯，当司机为太太、小姐们打开车门时，车内立即响起令人心旷神怡的轻音乐。车内铺着绿色的地毯、配有电话等特殊的服务设备，受到女性的普遍欢迎。
    妇女求爱日
    英国每逢闰年增加的这一天（二月二十九日）定为“妇女求爱日”。这一天，妇女有权摆脱世俗的清规戒律，大胆地向自己中意的男人或犹豫不决的情人求爱。一二八八年，苏格兰曾通过一项法律将二月二十九日定为“妇女权利日”，对那些放肆追逐女性的人课以罚款。“妇女求爱日”可能即源于此时。目前，对在这一天拒绝姑娘求爱的男子或是用一英镑作为象征性“赎罪”，或是用绸缎赠给“伤心的女方”。
    据有关部门调查，百分之九十以上的男子都在这一天接受了姑娘们的恋情。二月二十九日这一天，已经成为很多英国妇女决定命运的日子。
