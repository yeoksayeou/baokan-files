    Nima Zeren, a member of the Chinese Artists Association, has recently been appointed as a senior researcher in traditional Tibetan Buddhist painting at the Chinese Tibetan Buddhist College. He is the first Tibetan painter to receive this title.

    Nima Zeren, currently serving as a deputy researcher at the Sichuan Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Art Museum, graduated from the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts' Ethnic Middle School in 1962.

    Recently, the central government allocated a significant amount of funds to restore the Tashilhunpo Monastery, rebuild the stupas of the fifth to ninth Panchen Lamas, and dispatched a large number of painters to paint murals. Among the many painters, Panchen Erdeni Qojue Gyantsen, vice chairman, selected Nima Zeren to paint his portrait mural. Using traditional Tibetan painting techniques and modern painting skills, blending ancient and modern styles, and integrating Eastern and Western elements, Nima Zeren successfully completed this important task.

    尼玛泽仁晋升高级研究员
    本报讯　中国美术家协会会员尼玛泽仁，最近被中国藏语系高级佛学院聘为佛学院藏传佛教传统绘画高级研究员，成为第一个获得这一职称的藏族画家。
    现任四川省甘孜藏族自治州艺术馆副研究馆员的尼玛泽仁，1962年毕业于四川美术学院民族中专班。
    前不久，中央拨出巨款修复扎什伦布寺，新建五至九世班禅灵塔，并派出大批画家绘制壁画。在众多画家中，班禅额尔德尼·确吉坚赞副委员长选派了尼玛泽仁绘制自己的肖像壁画。他采用藏族传统绘画手法和现代绘画艺术技巧，古为今用，中西结合，出色地完成了这一重托。
