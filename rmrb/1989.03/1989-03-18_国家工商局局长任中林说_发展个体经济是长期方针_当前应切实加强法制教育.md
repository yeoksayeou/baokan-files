Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, Ren Zhonglin, Says Developing Individual Economy is a Long-Term Policy; Current Focus Should Be on Strengthening Legal Education

    The People's Daily, Beijing, March 17 — Reporter Pan Gang: During the "rectification," what will be the future for the 14 million urban and rural individual industrial and commercial households nationwide? Ren Zhonglin, Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said today that the central government's proposal for rectification and adjustment is to create good conditions for the healthy development of the individual economy. Encouraging the development of the individual economy is a long-term policy, not a temporary measure. He said that the immediate task is to strengthen ideological education, legal education, and professional ethics education for individual industrial and commercial households.

    The current session of the Chinese Individual Labor Cooperative Federation meeting provided data showing that in 1988, the total output value of individual industries, construction, and transportation nationwide reached 5.16 billion yuan. The retail sales of individual industrial and commercial households accounted for 13.8% of the total social retail sales. Since 1981, individual industrial and commercial households have paid 3 billion yuan in taxes to the state. At the same time, problems in the production and operation of individual industrial and commercial households are also prominent. For example, some do not adhere to professional ethics, some evade taxes, some engage in speculation, smuggling, and the production and sale of counterfeit goods, and a small number even gamble and engage in prostitution, leading to criminal activities. It is reported that last year, more than ten thousand individual households had their business licenses revoked, and several thousand were subjected to criminal penalties.

    Ren Zhonglin said that the individual economy will continue to develop, especially in remote areas, minority areas, and economically underdeveloped regions.

    发展个体经济是长期方针  当前应切实加强法制教育
    本报北京３月１７日讯  记者潘岗报道：在“整治”中，全国１４００万户城乡个体工商户出路何在？国家工商局局长任中林今天在此间称：中央提出治理、整顿，也是为个体经济的健康发展创造良好条件。鼓励发展个体经济是一项长期方针，不是权宜之计。他说，当务之急是，对个体工商户切实加强形势教育、法制教育和职业道德教育。
    正在召开的中国个体劳协理事会议提供的情况表明，１９８８年间，全国个体工业、建筑业、运输业总产值达５１６亿元。个体工商户商品零售额，占社会商品零售额的１３．８％。１９８１年以来，个体工商户向国家缴纳税金达３００亿元。与此同时，个体工商户生产、经营中存在的问题也相当突出。如，有的不讲职业道德，有的偷税漏税，有的从事投机倒把、走私贩私、制售假冒商品活动，还有极少数人赌博、嫖娼，走向犯罪道路。据称，去年被吊销营业执照的个体户有上万个，有数千人受到刑事处分。
    任中林说，个体经济还要继续发展，特别是边远地区、少数民族地区和经济不发达地区要发展。
