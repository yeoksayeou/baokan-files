　　中行在美筹资九千万美元
    标志在国际金融市场已具有一定影响
    新华社纽约３月８日电  （记者薛力敏）据中国银行纽约分行今天透露，它首次在美国牵头筹集国际银团贷款已获成功，这标志着它在国际金融市场上已经具有较大的影响。
    中国银行美国地区总经理王雪冰透露，总额达９０００万美元的国际银行贷款签字仪式于３月１日在纽约举行，参加这个贷款银团的有加拿大帝国商业银行、日本第一劝业银行、美国第一芝加哥银行和日本三和银行。
    这笔贷款是为中国化工进出口总公司所属中化美国有限公司筹集的，用于收购美国ＵＳＸ公司属下的佛罗里达农业化工公司的全部资产和产权以及ＵＳＸ公司在另一家公司５０％的股权。这是中国银行迄今为止在美国筹集的最大一笔资金，因而此举引起了当地金融界的兴趣与注意。
    王雪冰说，许多国际银行均积极要求参加这次融资活动，因此中行仅用３周时间就完成了全部筹款工作。
    这次筹资活动说明中行在国际金融市场上已经具有一定的影响和较高的信誉。
