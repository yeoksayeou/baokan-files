The craze for color TVs, refrigerators, cars... in recent years, the heat is rolling, various places are competing to produce hot-selling products, leading to repeated construction and repeated introductions, resulting in significant waste. Some people think that this way, they can manage everything without asking others, even if the overall efficiency is not high, it has not caused anyone to retreat, but instead, it has become more intense.

There are reasons for this. Take color TVs, for example. If your region does not produce color TVs, you can buy them from regions that do. However, things are not that simple. The color TV market is a seller's market, and color TVs have become the hottest item among hot items. Having color TVs means having fiscal revenue, and having color TVs means having other scarce resources. Those who have color TVs are naturally wealthy and powerful, while those who do not have to beg and plead, but it is still difficult to secure a reliable supply. Even if they go through great hardships to get a little, for the local population of several million or tens of millions who are eagerly waiting for color TVs, it is like a drop in the bucket. Therefore, this confirms a common saying: "Having a father and a mother is not as good as having one's own." Isn't there a catchy phrase: "If you don't build a textile mill or a brewery, you can't be a county magistrate; if you don't build a color TV factory, you can't be a provincial governor." These textile mills, breweries, and color TV factories are not only achievements but also bring many conveniences to the local area.

Facing a shortage economy and a fragmented market, because it is difficult to ask others for everything, it has stimulated some places and people to do everything big and complete, small and complete, in order to achieve the goal of not asking others for anything. Despite the state's repeated prohibitions against arbitrarily starting projects, the enthusiasm in various places is hard to curb.

To develop a socialist commodity economy, it is necessary to weaken the idea of not asking others for anything. To truly weaken this idea, one must make it easy to ask others, which relies on the balance between total demand and total supply, and the formation of a national unified market.

Someone might say, the state of shortage economy cannot be eliminated in the short term, and a national unified market cannot be formed overnight, so what should we do? Does this mean that we are completely powerless to change the situation where it is difficult to ask others? No! It should be said that there is still something we can do.

First of all, various departments and regions must have a holistic view, with local interests subordinated to overall interests. Reduce the scale of basic construction, and firmly press down on projects that should be reduced. Only by firmly pressing down can the contradiction between total supply and total demand be eased. Reasonably organize commodity exchanges, do not engage in regionalism, and make scarce commodities have a reasonable overall flow. Promote economic cooperation and mutual benefit between regions. For example, regions without designated hot-selling products can cooperate with designated regions to invest jointly, share profits, or provide supporting production of components for designated regions, with designated regions returning part of the products. This is beneficial for promoting scale operations and achieving scale benefits.

### 万事不求人与求人万事难

　　万事不求人与求人万事难
    皮子
    彩电热、冰箱热、汽车热……这几年热浪滚滚，各地争上热门产品，重复建设，重复引进，浪费很大。有人觉得，这样可以万事不求人，尽管总体效益不高，也没有使人后退，相反愈来愈烈。
    这也有它的原因。就说这彩电吧，你这个地区不出彩电，本可以向出彩电的地区购买，可是，事情没这么简单。彩电市场是卖方市场，彩电成了俏货中的俏货，有了彩电就有了财政收入，有了彩电就有了其它紧俏物资。手里有彩电者自然是财大气粗，没彩电者求爷爷告奶奶，也难有可靠的货源，即使千辛万苦弄到一点，对本地几百万、几千万盼彩电望眼欲穿的需求者来说，也是杯水车薪。所以，这就应了一句俗话：爹有娘有不如自己有。不是有这么一句顺口溜吗？不办纱厂、酒厂不能当县长，不办彩电厂不能当省长。这纱厂、酒厂、彩电厂，既是政绩，又给地方带来许多方便。
    面对短缺的经济、分割的市场，因万事求人难，更激发了一些地方、一些人去搞些大而全、小而全的东西，以达到万事不求人的目的。尽管国家三令五申不准乱上项目，可是各地热劲难减。
    发展社会主义的商品经济，必须弱化万事不求人的观念。真正弱化这个观念就要做到求人不难，这有赖于社会总需求与总供给的平衡，有赖于全国统一市场的形成。
    有人会说，短缺的经济状态不可能在短期内消除，全国统一市场也不可能一下子形成，怎么办？是不是现在对改变求人难的状况就完全无能为力了呢？不是的！应该说还是可以有所作为的。
    首要的，是各个部门、各地要有全局观念，地方利益服从全局利益。压缩基本建设规模，该压缩的项目就要坚决压。坚决压才能缓解总供给与总需求的矛盾。合理地组织商品交流，不搞地方割据，使紧缺商品有个总体合理的流向。推进地区之间的经济合作互助互利。比如，没有热门产品定点的地区与定点的地区联合投资、利益分成，或为定点地区配套，生产零部件，定点地区返还部分产品，这样，有利于促进规模经营，实现规模效益。
