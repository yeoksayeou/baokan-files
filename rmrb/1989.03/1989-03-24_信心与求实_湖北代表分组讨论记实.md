On March 22 and 23, representatives from Hubei Province attending the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress discussed the government work report delivered by Premier Li Peng. The reporter recorded the speeches of several representatives.

Zhao Baojiang (Mayor of Wuhan): Premier Li Peng's government work report has three prominent features: concentration, pragmatism, and clarity. As one of the central cities, Wuhan should follow the national unified planning and seriously implement the rectification and austerity measures. The report's shortcoming is that it does not clearly propose the tasks and roles of the national central cities.

Lin Jinxing (Professor at Huazhong University of Science and Technology): I feel that the government work report uses some exaggerated phrases when talking about the achievements of reform, which do not quite match the reality and are somewhat contradictory to the problems mentioned later. If the achievements are exaggerated, it may cause a backlash among the people.

Chen Shuiwen (Director of Yichang Region): In previous years, when the agricultural situation was better, some people made the wrong estimation that "there is more grain than we can eat and more cotton than we can use," resulting in losses. Due to the lagging policies, farmers' enthusiasm for production was dampened, leading to a decline in agriculture. Recently, we saw a couplet in Yichang County's Yaque Ling Town. The upper couplet reads, "Pesticides rise, plastic films rise, fertilizers rise, but grain prices do not rise," the lower couplet reads, "Taxes are collected, funds are raised, levies are increased, but wages are hard to come by," and the horizontal scroll reads, "What to do." This couplet reflects farmers' dissatisfaction with some current policies. I fully agree with the government work report's proposal to adjust the economic structure and strengthen agriculture's fundamental role in the national economy during the rectification and austerity period.

Guo Zhenqian (Governor of Hubei Province): We must solve the problems in economic life, such as inflation, rapid price increases, and overheating, through practical work and reform. We cannot retreat, and there is no way to retreat.

Zhao Ziqiang (Deputy Director and Chief Engineer of Wuhan Post and Telecommunications Science Research Institute): Rectifying the economic environment and order cannot be done by treating symptoms without addressing the root cause. Just as with a person, to reduce illness, one must fundamentally improve one's physical condition. Rectification and austerity must start from improving the quality of the entire population, especially that of cadres.

Hu Changmin (Vice Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of China National Democratic Construction Association): Strengthening the construction of clean government requires rationalizing and improving the constraint mechanism. Currently, the supervision and audit departments are subordinate to the same-level government, making it difficult to effectively supervise the bureaus and offices under the same government. As someone resisting the work of the audit and supervision departments said, "You are a bureau, and I am a bureau. Why should you supervise me?" I suggest that the audit and supervision agencies be placed under the National People's Congress to independently exercise supervision, which may better play the role of audit supervision and be beneficial to the construction of a clean government.

    ——湖北代表分组讨论记实
    本报记者  王谨
    ３月２２日、２３日，出席七届人大二次会议的湖北省代表就李鹏总理所作的政府工作报告进行了热烈的讨论。记者笔录了几位代表的发言。
    赵宝江（武汉市市长）：李鹏总理所作的政府工作报告有三个显著特点：集中、求实、明确。武汉作为中心城市之一，要按着全国一盘棋的思想，认真抓好治理整顿。报告不足的是，对全国中心城市的任务和作用没有明确提出。
    林金铭（华中理工大学教授）：我觉得政府工作报告在讲改革成绩时，用的一些修饰字眼不太切合实际，而且与后面谈到的问题有些矛盾。成绩讲的不切合实际，反而会造成老百姓的逆反心理。
    陈水文（宜昌地区专员）：前些年，农业形势好一些，有的人就作出“粮食吃不完，棉花用不完”的错误估计，结果吃亏了。由于政策跟不上，农民的生产积极性受到挫伤，农业出现了滑坡。不久前，我们曾在宜昌县鸦雀岭镇看到一家农民挂的对联。上联是“农药涨薄膜涨化肥涨就是粮价不涨”，下联是“税务要集资要提留要就是工钱难要”，横幅是“怎么办”。这副对联反映了农民对现行某些政策的不满。我很赞成政府工作报告提出在治理整顿中认真调整经济结构，切实加强农业在国民经济中的基础地位。
    郭振乾（湖北省省长）：对经济生活中存在一些问题，如通货膨胀、物价上涨过快、经济过热等等，必须通过实实在在地做工作，通过改革加以解决，决不能走回头路，也没有回头路可走。
    赵梓森（武汉邮电科学研究院副院长兼总工程师）：治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序，不能“头疼医头，脚疼医脚”。正像一个人一样，要少生病，就要从根本上提高身体素质。整顿治理，也需要从提高全民特别是干部的素质入手。
    胡昌民（民革武汉市委副主任委员）：加强廉政建设要理顺和完善制约机制。现在是监察和审计部门隶属于同级政府，对同级政府的委办局进行监督，实际很难有效实施监督，因为同样都是政府的机构。正像有人抵制审计、监督部门的工作时说的，“你也是局，我也是局，凭什么你监督我。”我建议审计、监督机构划归人大，独立行使监督权，这样可能更有效地发挥审计监督作用，有利于政府的廉政建设。
