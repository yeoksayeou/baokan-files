A recent invention in China's automobile industry has stirred excitement both domestically and internationally. This is the reciprocating piston internal combustion engine invented by Li Zhengzhong, chairman of Sichuan Global Technology Development Company, which has been hailed by domestic and foreign experts as a major breakthrough in internal combustion engine design.

This new type of engine, developed using the principle of the direct line, features a reciprocating piston without a connecting rod. Its key advantages include:

- **Compact Size**: It is 40% to 50% lighter than conventional engines of the same class.
- **Simple Structure**: 75% of its components are interchangeable with those of conventional engines, saving materials.
- **Fuel Efficiency**: It generally reduces fuel consumption by 13% to 16% and extends the engine's lifespan.
- **Easy Start and Smooth Operation**: It starts easily, runs smoothly, and has minimal vibration, significantly enhancing passenger comfort.
- **Reduced Pollution and Noise**: It burns gasoline more completely, reducing emissions and noise.
- **Cost-Effective**: It is affordable.

This new type of internal combustion engine can be widely used in cars, trucks, airplanes, and ships. It is reported that the State Patent Office has recently granted this invention a patent.

　　我汽车工业一项发明振奋人心  新型内燃机体小低耗少污价廉
    据新华社成都３月１８日电  （记者李南玲、实习生胡杰）我国汽车工业的一项新发明最近震动了国内外汽车行业。这就是四川环球技术开发公司董事长黎正中发明的曲柄圆滑块往复活塞式内燃机，它被国内外专家认为是内燃机结构上的重大变革。
    应用直蚌线原理发明的这种无连杆的往复活塞式发动机的突出优点是：体积小，比同类常规机轻４０％至５０％；结构简单，７５％的零部件可与常规同类机通用，节约原料；油耗一般可下降１３％至１６％，发动机的使用寿命相对延长；容易启动，运转平稳，几乎无振动，大大提高了乘坐时的舒适感；汽油燃烧更为充分，排污减少，噪音低；成本低廉。
    这种新型内燃机可广泛用于轿车、货车、飞机、轮船上。据了解，国家专利局最近已正式授予这项发明以专利权。
