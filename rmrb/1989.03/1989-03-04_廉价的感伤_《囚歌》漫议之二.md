Cheap Sentimentality

A Discussion on "Prison Song" Part II

Jin Zhaojin

Songs of vagrant beggars, "sent-down youth" songs, including "Prison Song," all primarily express emotions of longing for family, melancholy, disappointment, and nostalgia. They are typical examples of sentimentalism but carry a strong vulgar style. To put it further, it is a delicate emotion accompanied by a crude style, a kind of romantic sentiment from the lower classes. This peculiar combination of high and low culture deeply reflects the imbalance in contemporary Chinese social culture. In terms of their melancholic emotions, they carry a sense of opposition to the current culture, and thus, at their core, they are a sickly, weak, and twisted psychological emotion suppressed.

Musically, these songs lack creativity in their melodies and structures, but their unique singing styles inject a kind of vitality. Songs of vagrant beggars have a strong "hoodlum" flavor, "sent-down youth" songs emphasize natural and sincere vocalization, and prison songs focus on unique vocal techniques. These all give the songs unique aesthetic characteristics. However, from what I have heard on the tapes, they have not fully expressed these unique styles. On the contrary, a considerable part of the singing, under electronic accompaniment, only reveals the singer's low taste. Therefore, tapes like "Prison Song" do not represent any progress, either in consciousness or in music. Their cultural significance is far from comparable to the "northwest wind" on the music scene. Their only important value is to make people publicly aware of the existence of historical music cultures like those of vagrant beggars, "sent-down youth," and prison inmates.

However, it has become popular and turned into a trend. We must further observe this phenomenon.

One reason is easy to understand: the strong "northwest wind" has led to a psychological reversal in auditory aesthetics, and another style, or more precisely, a soft and lyrical style, must re-emerge to create the balance of styles needed in popular culture. Because popular culture is often multi-layered and changes rapidly with societal psychological shifts.

There is a phenomenon worth noting: currently, Taiwanese singer Qixin's songs, like Qiong Yao's novels, are occupying middle schools, while "Prison Song" targets a broad range of young people in society. If we notice that a considerable number of young people in society and individual business owners have long been suppressed and ignored by society, it is easy to understand why they like these songs.

However, there is a problem worth worrying about. In terms of the overall situation of reform and opening up, China obviously needs a cultural spirit of change and independence, rather than a melancholic and decadent nostalgia. The popularity of "Prison Song" shows a clear indication of an unhealthy social psychology and a lack of public morale. Sad and despondent songs like "Prison Song" have become popular because they match the current social psychology, but this does not mean that we should unconditionally affirm the intrinsic meaning of any cultural phenomenon. I believe that the popularity of tapes like "Prison Song" once again clearly shows the generally low cultural quality of society, just like a few years ago when a batch of vulgar tapes like "Ji Gong Plays with a Nun" spread.

　　廉价的感伤
    ——《囚歌》漫议之二
    金兆钧
    盲流歌曲，“知青”歌曲，包括《囚歌》等，均以抒发思念亲人、惆怅、失意、怀旧等情绪为主要内容，是一种感伤主义的典型表现，但又具有浓重的俚俗风格。进一步说，也就是粗俗风格伴随下的细腻情感，是一种带有浓重浪漫气息的底层情绪。这种雅俗文化的奇异结合深刻地反映出我国当代社会文化不平衡的特点。就其忧怨情绪而言，它带着对现文化的对抗，因此骨子里是一种病态的、孱弱的、压抑下扭曲的心理情绪。
    从音乐上，它们的旋法、曲式缺乏创造性，但其独特的演唱方式给它注入了一种活力。盲流歌曲带有浓重的“痞气”，“知青”歌曲讲求发声的自然真挚，劳改犯歌曲的唱法注重特殊的音色处理，这些都给歌曲带来了独特的审美特点。然而，就我听到的盒带中，还远远未能全面表现出这些独特的风格，相反，相当部分的演唱只是在电声伴奏下显示出了歌手的低格调。因此，《囚歌》等盒带本身从意识到音乐上都不意味着任何进步，其文化上的积极意义远远不能与歌坛的“西北风”相提并论。它唯一重要的价值是使人们公开注意到盲流、“知青”等历史音乐文化的存在，注意到劳改人员音乐文化的存在。
    但它终于流行，并成为一股大潮。对此，我们还必须进一步作出观察。
    有一个原因是易于理解的，即强劲的“西北风”之盛行导致了听觉审美的心理逆反，另一种风格，或明确地说，阴柔的抒情风格必然要重新出现以造成大众文化所需要的风格的平衡，因为大众文化往往是多层次的，而且是随着社会的心理转变而迅速变化的。
    有一个现象值得注意，在当前，台湾歌手齐秦的歌曲如同琼瑶小说一样正在占领着中学，而《囚歌》则以广大社会青年为对象。如果注意到相当一批社会青年与个体户曾长期受压抑，不被社会所重视，这些歌曲为他们所好就不难理解了。
    但有一个问题值得忧虑，就改革开放之大形势而言，中国显然更需要具有变革和独立意识的文化精神，而不是惆怅颓唐的怀旧情调。《囚歌》之流行，除去猎奇心理（因演员的特殊身份引起）外，明显地显示出社会心理的不健全和民气的不振。悲凉、颓丧的《囚歌》等歌曲磁带由于吻合了目前的这种社会心理，故而盛极一时，但这并不意味着人们应该无条件地肯定任何文化现象的内在意义。我认为，《囚歌》等磁带的流行，再一次明确显示出了社会文化素质的普遍低下，这如同几年前一批庸俗不堪的磁带诸如《济公戏尼姑》之类的流传一样。
