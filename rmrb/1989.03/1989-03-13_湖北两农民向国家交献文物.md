Two farmers in Hubei donate cultural relics to the state

People's Daily, Enshi, March 12th - On February 22nd, farmers Long Baohai and Huang Haoran from Jinlongba Village in Enshi City, Hubei, discovered seven cultural relics in a cave in their village. The relics include a set of bells, a long-necked pot, a short-necked pot, and a ding (a type of ancient Chinese cooking vessel). Except for the bells, the other five relics are adorned with fish patterns, crane patterns, name patterns, taotie (a mythical gluttonous beast) patterns, and animal patterns, each with unique and intricate designs. Preliminary investigations by the cultural relics department suggest that these artifacts date back to the Eastern Han Dynasty.

The two farmers refused high offers from private collectors and voluntarily handed over the relics to the Enshi City Cultural Relics Bureau on March 9th. Recently, they were commended by relevant departments in Enshi City.
