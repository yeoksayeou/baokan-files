Deputies to the Seventh National People's Congress, Second Session, emphasized the need for the entire nation to uphold the spirit of hard work and self-reliance during their discussions of the government work report delivered by Premier Li Peng and the reports by Ma Yipeng and Wang Zhenqian. They pointed out that without this spirit, the rectification and austerity drive would be difficult to achieve, and the country's prosperity would be impossible.

Many deputies believe that upholding the spirit of hard work and self-reliance is crucial for enhancing the cohesion of the people and their confidence in overcoming difficulties. Vice Chairman Hab Zhenqin stressed during the group discussion that the Yan'an spirit is about seeking truth from facts, self-reliance, hard work, and wholeheartedly serving the people, sharing weal and woe with the masses. He said that this spirit must never be abandoned. To carry forward our fine traditions, we must not just make reports to the people; we must lead by example.

Song Renqiong, Vice Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission, proposed that socialism requires hard work and self-reliance, and we must strive for ten, twenty years, even until the mid-21st century. He said that at any time, we must not abandon the tradition of hard work and self-reliance.

Li Ruihuan, Mayor of Tianjin, said that maintaining and carrying forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance should start from the leadership at all levels. There must be a spirit of perseverance, striving for success, and sharing weal and woe with the people. We must insist on the practice of cadres participating in labor and going deep into the realities, and oppose the trend of extravagance and waste. Effective measures must be taken to ensure this.

Chen Futa, a deputy from Henan, mentioned that the ancient saying "Prosperity comes from thrift, ruin comes from extravagance" is worth pondering. He criticized that some village cadres borrow 210,000 yuan to buy a Santana car, which is unacceptable.

Li Changchun, Governor of Liaoning Province, said that the idea of tightening our belts for a few years should not only be held by governments at all levels but also be propagated among all the people, so that everyone is prepared to overcome long-term difficulties. We should not raise people's expectations too high, making the Party and the government always in a state of "owing debts."

Many deputies reflected that there has been a serious "slip" in the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, with weakened ideological and political work. Everything is solved by giving money, and work is done through "paid services."

Lu Shenghe, a deputy from Liaoning, said that the power of examples is infinite. In the past, we publicized a group of model workers, who played an important role in socialist construction. Now we need to sing praises for those who dedicate themselves to hard work and self-reliance, publicize their spirit, and inspire the whole nation to overcome difficulties. All news, publishing, and other propaganda units should take this as their mission.

　　人大代表审议政府工作报告时强调        
    全国上下共同艰苦奋斗
    治理整顿不难取得成效
    据新华社北京３月２８日电  出席七届全国人大二次会议的代表在审议李鹏总理和姚依林、王丙乾所作的报告时强调全国上下要发扬艰苦奋斗的精神。他们指出，没有这样一种精神，治理整顿很难取得成效，国家富强也是不可能的。
    许多代表认为，发扬艰苦奋斗的精神，对增强人民群众的凝聚力和克服困难的信心有重要意义。习仲勋副委员长在分组审议时强调，延安精神就是实事求是，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，全心全意为人民服务，同群众同甘共苦。他说，这些精神任何时候也不能丢掉。而要发扬我们的好传统，不能只靠向群众作报告，主要靠以身作则。
    中顾委副主任宋任穷代表提出，搞社会主义就要艰苦奋斗，要奋斗十年、二十年直到二十一世纪四五十年代。他说，任何时候都不能丢艰苦奋斗传统。
    天津市市长李瑞环代表说，保持和发扬艰苦奋斗精神，应该从各级领导做起，要有那么一种卧薪尝胆、发奋图强、与群众同甘共苦的劲头。要坚持干部参加劳动、深入实际的做法，反对铺张奢侈之风。并且要有切实有效的措施作保证。
    河南代表陈福泰谈到，古语说“历览前贤国与家，成由勤俭败由奢”，这很值得深思。他批评说，现在有的村干部贷２１万巨款去买桑塔纳轿车坐，这怎么得了。
    辽宁省省长李长春代表说，过几年紧日子的思想不仅各级政府要有，还要在全体人民中进行宣传，使大家有长期克服困难的思想准备，不能把各方面的胃口吊起来，使党和政府总是处于“欠帐”的状况。
    许多代表反映说，社会主义精神文明建设出现了严重的“滑坡”现象，思想政治工作削弱，什么事情都靠发钱解决问题，靠“有偿服务”做工作。
    辽宁代表卢盛和说，榜样的力量是无穷的。以前我们宣传了一批劳模，在社会主义建设中起了重要作用。现在我们更需要为艰苦奋斗的奉献者唱赞歌，宣传他们的精神，激励全国人民克服困难。一切新闻、出版等宣传单位，应当以此为己任。
