    World Table Tennis Championship Diary
    March 26, Sunny

    Xu Yinsheng, the team leader, and Li Furen, the deputy team leader, along with four other members, arrived here from China this morning. They were accommodated at the Queen Hotel in the small town of Hagen, on the outskirts of Dortmund.

    Upon learning of Xu Yinsheng's arrival, many Chinese journalists flocked to interview him about his thoughts on returning to Dortmund after 30 years to participate in the World Table Tennis Championship. He replied, "I just got off the plane and am still disoriented. I don't even know what the city looks like, so how can I have any thoughts? You journalists always ask the same questions."

    Today, the Soviet team appeared in the training hall. Coach Zhang Xianlin noticed that the European women's singles champion, Bratova, was not present. Upon inquiry, it was discovered that during a recent international competition, she had refused to play after disagreeing with a referee's judgment. Despite the coach's efforts, she still refused to take the court, and the Soviet team decided to remove her from the World Table Tennis Championship roster. Zhang Xianlin was deeply moved and told Xu Shaofa, "Their team management is so strict, showing no favoritism to their star players. If they don't do this, how can the team's morale improve? I think when it's necessary to be strict, the coach should take responsibility." Xu Shaofa agreed.

    The World Table Tennis Championship is approaching, and the Westfalen Stadium, which was quiet just two days ago, has suddenly become lively.

    Today, the Chinese team trained less. The road to the stadium was congested with heavy traffic. Today is the last day of the Easter holiday, and there are many cars on the road.

    The team members only exercised for about an hour in the stadium. Today is the 21st birthday of young player Ma Wenge. After dinner, Xu Shaofa brought out a custom-made large cake, and let Xiaoma cut it into dozens of pieces. Everyone celebrated his unusual birthday before the start of the World Table Tennis Championship with laughter and wishes.

    In the afternoon, after the Chinese team finished training, the Swedish team immediately began training in the same venue. I and several Chinese journalists are old acquaintances with the Swedish men's team coach, Ost. We greeted each other warmly. Then we directly asked him about his expectations for the men's team competition. He replied frankly, "I hope to compete with the Chinese team in the final. We have faced each other in the final for three consecutive championships and lost all three times. There is an old Chinese saying, 'Things do not happen three times,' but I hope this time we can win."

    When asked who had the best chance of winning the men's singles title, Ost first mentioned China's Chen Longcan, followed by South Korea's Liu Nanqui, China's Teng Yi, and North Korea's Kim Chengxi. Strangely, he did not mention Jiang Jialiang at all.

　　世乒赛日记
    ３月２６日晴
    徐寅生团长和李富荣副团长一行四人，今早从国内飞抵这里，他们被安排多特蒙德市郊区小镇哈根的皇后旅馆。
    不少中国记者得知徐寅生抵达的消息，纷纷前来请他谈时隔３０年再来多特蒙德参加世乒赛的感想，他说：“我刚下飞机，晕头转向的，连市区什么模样的都不知道，哪来什么感想。你们记者怎么全是一样的题目。”
    苏联队今天出现在训练馆里，张燮林教练突然发现苏联女队中欧洲女子单打冠军布拉托娃没有露面，一打听才知道在前不久一次国际比赛中，她因对裁判的一个误判有意见便赌气不打了。教练做工作后，她仍不肯上场，苏联队便决定将她从世乒赛报名单上撤下来。张燮林很有感触地对许绍发说，“人家队伍管理多严，对尖子队员一点也不袒护，不这样的话，队里风气怎么能正起来。我看该严就得严，教练敢于负责任。”许绍发很赞同。

    距世乒赛开幕的日子越来越近，威斯法伦体育馆前２天还显得冷冷清清，现在一下子热闹起来。
    今天，中国队练得不多，来体育馆的路上堵车堵得很厉害。今天是复活节假期的最后一天，汽车多极了。
    队员们在比赛馆只活动了一个小时左右，今天是小将马文革２１岁生日，晚饭后，许绍发端出一个订做的大蛋糕，让小马用刀切成几十份，大家在欢笑声中祝贺他在世乒大赛开始前渡过这个不平常的生日。
    　　　　３月２８日　晴
    下午，中国队训练完后，瑞典队紧接着在同一场地训练。我和几位中国记者同瑞典男队教练奥斯特是老相识，一见面便热情地互致问候。随后我们直截了当问他对男子团体赛有何展望，他也很爽快地回答：“希望决赛中再同中国队一争高低。我们已连续３届同中国队决赛，三战三负。中国不是有句老话吗，事不过三，但愿这次轮到我们取胜。”
    谈到谁最有希望摘取男子单打桂冠时，奥斯特首推中国的陈龙灿，其次他说有南朝鲜的刘南奎、中国的滕毅、朝鲜的金成熙。奇怪的是他根本没有提江嘉良。
