Currently, a wave of intense spring plowing and management, without letting up on measures until the harvest is secured, has swept across both the northern and southern regions.

Because many local party and government departments have started to focus their work on agriculture, the overall situation for spring plowing this year is better than last year. However, there are also worrying shadows. According to the National Bureau of Statistics' survey of more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions nationwide, the available quantities of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films this year are 17%, 21.6%, and 31.2% short of the demand, respectively; the shortages of seeds, diesel, and small and medium-sized farm tools are even greater, reaching 50%, 34.9%, and 28.4%, respectively. Since the beginning of spring, there have been widespread reports of shortages of agricultural production materials across the country, with the most prominent supply-demand contradiction being pesticides. According to the National Plant Protection Station's forecast, due to the unusually high temperatures in winter and spring, the base number of pests surviving the winter is large, and this year's crop diseases, pests, and weeds are likely to be more severe. However, the national pesticide production in January and February this year only completed 74.3% of the plan. Even if the plan is fully completed, it will still fall far short of the demand planned by the agricultural supply departments. Due to the high prices and shortages of agricultural materials, coupled with a lack of funds and slow material allocation, many regions' urgently needed agricultural materials such as fertilizers have not yet reached the hands of farmers. In addition, heavy snowfall in some southern regions has posed a threat of waterlogging to crops, and the fluctuating temperatures will also have an adverse effect on the greening and jointing of wheat.

At this critical moment of spring plowing and management, the Ministry of Agriculture believes that all regions must not relax in the slightest and must grasp each agricultural task solidly and link by link. They must treat the task of securing a bumper harvest this year as a tough battle.

　　春耕正忙　农资苦少
    农业部提醒：夺丰收不可丝毫懈怠
    据新华社北京３月６日电  （记者蒲立业、实习生曾继双）目前，一场丰收不到手、措施不松劲的春耕春管热潮，已在南北方普遍掀起。
    由于许多地区的党政部门工作重点已开始转向农业，今年春耕生产总的形势好于去年。但是，也笼罩着令人不安的阴影。据国家统计局对全国２０多个省、市、区的调查，今年全国化肥、农药、农膜可供量比需求量分别缺少１７％、２１．６％和３１．２％；良种、柴油及中小农具缺口更大，分别达５０％、３４．９％和２８．４％。入春以来，各地普遍反映农业生产资料紧缺，其中供需矛盾最突出的是农药。据全国植保总站预测，由于冬春气温偏高，病虫越冬基数大，今年农作物病虫草害将偏重发生，但今年１—２月份全国农药生产却只完成计划的７４．３％，即使全部完成计划，也与农资部门要货计划相差甚远。由于农用物资价高货缺，加上资金缺乏，物资调拨速度缓慢，不少地区的化肥等急需农用物资迄今仍未到达农民手中。此外，南方部分地区普降大雪，使农作物面临渍涝威胁，忽高忽低的气温，也将对小麦返青拔节产生不利影响。
    当此春耕春管的关键时刻，农业部认为，各地不可有丝毫懈怠，务必扎扎实实、一环扣一环地抓好各项农事工作，把夺取今年农业丰收当做一场硬仗来打。
