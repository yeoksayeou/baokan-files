Night Song

	Spring Night at the Square

	This is a spring night at Tiananmen Square.

	The wind has rested in the distant, silent woods.

	The night mist, like clouds, gently descends along the stone steps of the Monument to the People's Heroes, bestowing a deep blue sea's tranquility upon every brick and every inch of space in the square. I know that the frenzied shouts stirred by deception have already fled from the alleys surrounding the square. The heart-rending struggles and flowing blood have also cooled down. Only the dazzling lights still bloom like thoughts, silently gazing.

	People have finally returned to their solemn simplicity. The night of the square has finally gained the tranquility to sweep away any sudden storms or hurricanes—

	It is the tranquility that has grown from the ruins after the turmoil.

	The spasms of yesterday and the glory of tomorrow are thus connected by a solid bridge.

	Reflection and conviction drive today's march forward.

	Thus, history returns to spring, returns to the open road, beginning to use the mighty force of bulldozers, steel, music, classrooms, and fertile fields to heal its deep, abyssal sufferings and wounds. For history, under the solemn starlight, has leaned against the majestic and ancient Great Wall to contemplate the entire path of destiny, thereby finding its compass, its star chart, and its bright and shining Big Dipper.

	Spring night, this is the most tranquil moment of Tiananmen Square.

	The wind has long rested in the distant woods.

	Time has regained all that is its own...

	New Year's Bell

	The New Year's bell rings.

	The New Year's bell echoes over the starry river in the sky, carrying the vast and boundless energy of distant mountains and forests, fluttering like mist and clouds, falling into the fields of my soul...

	The final reckoning of the year has ended.

	The first plowing of the new year begins.

	So, let's plant a garden of sunflowers again!

	But the streets remain the same, still bearing yesterday's burdens.

	The lights remain the same, still as hazy as yesterday.

	The fireworks in the children's hands still pierce the night's blockade, exploding in the sky with a thousand human emotions and myriad expressions.

	My heart is filled with a bit more melancholy.

	But it is also filled with many more green winds of hope.

	So, let's plant a garden of sunflowers again!

	In the New Year's night, the bell rings softly.

	The New Year's bell, like mist and clouds, echoes over the starry river, over the vast distant lands, seeping into the furrows of my blood-soaked fields...

	At the Twilight Crossroads

	I stand at the twilight crossroads.

	The twilight rolls in with the weeping of twilight clouds from all directions.

	A bird like a meteor swiftly flies past my eyes.

	In this indescribable moment, she carries away countless indescribable secrets.

	Thus, with a pair of eyes that pave the way to the heavens, I silently send her to the farthest end of the sky.

	Is she the spirit of the departing day?

	Where will she rest?

	Will there be her bed, her branches, and her grasslands?

	And the distant place is where the sea of night surges and roars.

	Will she be afraid of the night's waves?

	She is lonely, perhaps.

	Will she weave her own joy?

	This tiny spirit, this fleeting messenger of time, takes my heart like a runaway horse, very far, very far...

	Red Scarf

	Red scarf...

	The red scarf rides the wind, drifting away in the land of stars.

	The dream boat sails through confusion, with a long and bumpy journey.

	In the morning, I see outside the window, spring snow embracing silver waves.

	Is it the moonlight that withered yesterday?

	Is it the white chrysanthemums that withered in the wilderness?

	Only the abundant branches of the oleander sway solemnly in the snow waves, like a joyful garden hidden in the clear and warm air, faintly revealing its laughter.

	Ah, the song has faded, the laughter pours down from the clouds.

	Seeing the white snow, I still see the spring light.

	In this wistful season, there is still a dazzling light.

	The red scarf drifts away in the land of stars.

	The red scarf leaves a piece of joyful sorrow...

　　夜歌
    刘虔
    广场春夜
    这是天安门广场的春夜。
    风，歇息在远方沉寂的林莽。
    夜霭如云，沿着英雄纪念碑前的石阶悠悠而下，用一汪深海的幽蓝把绿荫的安详赠与了广场上的每一块砖石和每一寸充实的空间。我知道，那些被蛊惑的呼号激荡起来的疯狂，早已从广场四周的路巷逃遁了。撕人心肺的格斗同流淌的怒血也已冷却。只有耀眼的华灯依然张开花朵一般的思想，无语而凝睇。人们终于复归于崇伟的质朴，广场之夜也终于获得了足以扫荡任何突然袭来的雷暴和飓风的宁静——
    是从动乱之后的瓦砾间生长起来的宁静。
    昨天的痉挛与明天的辉煌因之有了坚固的桥梁。
    省悟和信念推动着今天的进军。
    这样，历史便又回到了春天，回到了坦途，开始用推土机的伟力、钢铁、音乐、课堂和田野的丰盈来平复她深渊般的苦难与创伤。因为历史已经在庄严的星光下依傍着巍峨而苍老的长城思考了整个命运的道路，从而找到了它的罗盘，它的星图，它的明光灿灿的北斗。
    春夜，这是天安门广场最宁静的时刻。
    风，早已歇息在远方的林莽。
    时光，重新拥有了自己的一切……
    年夜钟声
    年夜，钟声响起。
    年夜的钟声漫过长空星河之水，挟着远山丛林苍莽之气，纷纷扬扬，如雾如云，飘落于我灵魂的田野里……
    一年最后的清算结束了。
    新年最初的耕耘开始了。
    那么，再种一园太阳花吧？！
    只是大街依旧，依旧有昨日的重负。
    只是灯光依旧，依旧是昨日的朦胧。
    孩子们手中的烟火，依旧穿过夤夜的封锁，在天宇之上爆出人间千种风情万般音容。
    我的心多了一些惆怅。
    但也多了许多期望的绿风。
    那么，再种一园太阳花吧？！
    年夜里，钟声悠悠响起。
    年夜的钟声如雾如云，漫过星河之水，漫过漠漠远土，浸入了我的血水滋润的田垄……
    在黄昏的路口
    我站在黄昏的路口。
    暮色卷着暮云的泣声，从四方涌来。
    一只雀鸟如流星从我眼前匆匆飞过。
    在这难以名状的时刻，她带走了许许多多难以名状的秘密。
    于是，我用一双目光铺就的天路，默默地送她到了远空的尽处。
    她就是那即将离去的白昼的精灵吗？
    她将在哪儿歇脚呢？
    那里可有她的眠床，她的枝头和草丛？
    而远方，正是夜之海湃澎汹涌的地方。
    她会因夜的风浪而恐惧吗？
    她是寂寞的，也许。
    她可会编织自己的欢乐？
    这个娇小的精灵，这个倏然而去的时光使者，带着我的心如脱缰之马走得很远很远……
    红红的纱巾
    红红的纱巾……
    红红的纱巾驾着风飘逝在星辰之国里。
    梦舟划过窘惑，航程漫长而坎坷。
    清晨起来，但见窗外春雪拥着银浪。
    那是昨日凋谢的月光吗？
    是旷野凋谢的白菊花吗？
    只有繁枝纷披的桃金娘在雪浪中庄严摇曳，如一座气清日暖的乐园隐隐显露的欢语。
    呵，歌声远了，笑声从云中倾泄。
    但见白雪，犹见春光。
    怅惘的时节，也有耀眼的光芒。
    红红的纱巾飘逝在星辰之国里了。
    红红的纱巾留下一片欢乐的哀伤……
