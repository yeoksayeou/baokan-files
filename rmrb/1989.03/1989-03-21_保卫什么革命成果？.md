Title: Defend What Revolutionary Achievements?

On the tenth anniversary of Vietnam's large-scale invasion and occupation of Cambodia, the Vietnam People's Army Central Military Commission and the Ministry of National Defense's publication, "National Defense," published a lengthy article evaluating the decision by the Le Duan faction to invade Cambodia. If this article could truly help the Vietnamese authorities recognize the right and wrong of their Cambodian war and its consequences, it would not be a futile attempt at repentance and reform. Unfortunately, the conclusion of this article is: "Regardless of whether a political solution to the Cambodian issue can be reached, the revolutionary achievements in Cambodia must be defended." In other words, it is "definitely necessary to defend" the situation where Cambodia is under Vietnamese military occupation and the Heng Samrin puppet regime is in sole power.

Over the past ten years, the Vietnamese authorities have spared no effort in defending this "achievement," to the point where the domestic economy is in ruins and they are extremely isolated internationally. This "revolutionary achievement" is nothing but a bitter pill for the Vietnamese authorities to swallow. In the context of international efforts to resolve the Cambodian issue from various angles, the proposal to "defend the achievements" in the article "National Defense" is clearly a bad idea rather than good advice to the Vietnamese highest decision-making authorities.

The reason why this lengthy "theoretical" article concludes with "defend the achievements" is that it emphasizes that Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia was "very necessary" and "completely correct." Starting from the premise of "justified invasion," what kind of good article can be written?

### 保卫什么革命成果？

　　保卫什么革命成果？
    在越南大举出兵侵占柬埔寨十周年之际，越共中央军委和国防部机关刊物《全民国防》杂志发表了一篇长文，评说黎笋集团的侵柬决定。如果这篇文章真能帮助越南当局认识其侵柬战争的是非和利害，倒也不失为悔过思改之举。但遗憾的是，这篇文章的结论竟是：“不管柬埔寨问题能否达成政治解决办法，柬埔寨革命成果一定要保卫。”说白了，就是“一定要保卫”柬埔寨处于越军占领之下和韩桑林傀儡独家掌权的局面。
    １０年来，越南当局保卫这个“成果”不可谓不卖力，直保得国内经济凋敝，国际上十分孤立。这种“革命成果”，对越南当局来说无异于一颗难以下咽的苦果。在国际上多方谋求解决柬埔寨问题的形势下，《全民国防》杂志的文章提出“保卫成果”的主张，究竟是在向越南最高决策当局出好主意还是馊点子就昭昭然了。
    这篇洋洋洒洒的“理论”长文之所以作出“保卫成果”的结论，是因为它强调越南出兵侵柬“十分必要”、“完全正确”。从“侵略有理”的前提出发，能作出什么好文章？
