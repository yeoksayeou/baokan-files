The reform and opening up have brought about a situation where "hundreds of families engage in commerce," making economic forms diversified, commodity operations decentralized, and economic interest relationships diversified and complex. Under these circumstances, the commercial management system that was adapted to the "monopoly of state-owned commerce" has obviously become outdated. It is necessary to establish a new system for unified management of social commerce and market activities, strengthen macro-control within the circulation sector, and adapt to the new pattern of "hundreds of families engaging in commerce." This is not only an objective requirement for the development of a planned commodity economy but also an important aspect of the current rectification of the circulation order.

The establishment of a new system for unified management of social commerce and market activities involves the unified national management of commodity operators (enterprises or individuals) of various economic forms and organizational forms and their market activities. This does not mean micro-managing every purchasing and selling activity of each commodity operator. If it did, it would be a return to the old system. The fundamental task of unified management of social commerce should be to coordinate, coordinate, serve, and supervise the purchasing and selling activities and interest distribution of commodity operators of various economic forms and organizational forms in society from a macro perspective. It should create conditions that are conducive to the smooth operation of commodity circulation and create a market environment that is conducive to production, consumption, and the normal operation of the entire national economy. In this sense, establishing a new system for unified management of social commerce and market activities is not only an important aspect of the current rectification of economic order but also an important aspect of deepening the overall reform and establishing a new order for the socialist commodity economy. Therefore, how to grasp the principles and goals of "unified management" is a very important issue.

The state's management of social commerce and market activities should reflect the principle of "unified management, equal legal status." That is, the unified management of the state over commodity operators and their market behaviors, whether through economic means, legal means, or administrative means, should have equal effectiveness for commodity operators of various departments, regions, and economic forms, placing them in an equal legal status and enabling them to compete on an equal market basis. The central and local governments should certainly have a division of management authority, but the management of any level of government must adhere to the principles of "unified and equal" on the premise of separating government and enterprise. Except for certain flexible policies for "old, young, border, poor, and special" regions, it is generally not allowed to arbitrarily "provide policies" or create special conditions for commodity circulation and market behavior issues. In terms of laws and regulations, it is not allowed to have any "adjustments." In this regard, it is crucial to coordinate and standardize the management behaviors of governments at all levels and various business departments, and to solve the problem of "multiple departments and multiple policies."

One of the important goals of unified management of social commerce and market activities is to standardize market behavior. To this end, it is necessary to quickly establish a complete set of laws and regulations related to commodity circulation and market behavior. "The more open and active, the more management is needed," and it should not be limited to meetings but should be concretized into various rules and regulations with operability and measurability. In addition to the laws and regulations such as the "Enterprise Law," "Economic Contract Law," "Trademark Law," and "Temporary Regulations on Advertisement Management" that have been promulgated and implemented, it is urgent to formulate laws and regulations such as the "Commercial Law," "Anti-Monopoly Law," "Consumer Protection Law," "Price Law," "Financial Law," and "Bill Law." For those that are not yet mature, it is not a problem to first promulgate temporary regulations. Considering that China is an agricultural country and farmers' economic interests are often affected by market activities, it is also possible to consider formulating special regulations such as the "Farmers' Market Interest Law." All laws and regulations that have been promulgated and implemented should provide independent judicial guarantees separate from administrative authorities and promptly punish various illegal behaviors.

Stabilizing the market situation is also an important goal of unified management of social commerce and market activities. In this regard, the most important thing is to organize the circulation of important commodities that are crucial to the stability of the overall market. The so-called "important commodities that are crucial to the stability of the market" should meet two conditions: they must be commodities that are in short supply or are likely to be in short supply for a relatively long period; they must also be important commodities related to the national economy and people's livelihood. There are not many such commodities, but they are either basic means of subsistence for people such as grain, or basic means of production for agriculture such as fertilizers and plastic film, or basic raw materials for processing industries such as steel and cotton, or resource-constrained products related to sustainable resource use such as timber, or special commodities that have an important impact on national financial revenue such as gold and cigarettes. According to supply and demand conditions, it is necessary and not difficult to separate these "important minorities" from the "general majority" at the right time and implement coordinated planning and administrative management for their circulation in terms of price, credit, taxation, purchasing and selling methods, and purchasing and selling channels. This will ensure the reasonable allocation of important resources, ensure the basic stability of people's lives, prevent resource-destroying operations such as killing the hen that lays the golden eggs, prevent certain folk groups or individuals from obtaining huge excess profits, and prevent large fluctuations in market prices. The market will then be basically stable. This is one of the main conditions for the normal operation of the economy under the condition of a "shortage economy" and is directly related to the fairness of social distribution.

To implement unified national management of social commerce and market behavior, or to establish a commercial management system that adapts to the new pattern of commodity circulation, it is necessary to establish an authoritative government agency for managing social commerce and market activities. In this regard, it is necessary to conduct investigations and research, summarize experiences, propose scientific designs, and make scientific decisions.

　　建立统一管理社会商业的新体制
    纪宝成
    改革开放带来了流通领域“百家经商”的局面，不仅经济形式多元化了，商品经营分散化了，经济利益关系也多元化、复杂化了。在这种情况下，过去与国营商业“一统天下”相适应的商业管理体制显然已经过时。建立起统一管理社会商业和市场活动的新体制，加强流通领域内的宏观调控，以与“百家经商”的流通新格局相适应，既是发展有计划商品经济的客观要求，也是当前整顿流通秩序的一项重要内容。
    建立统一管理社会商业和市场活动的新体制，对各种经济形式、各种组织形式的商品经营者（企业或个人）及其市场活动实施统一的国家管理，当然不是要从微观上管死每一个商品经营者的购销活动。如果这样，那就成了旧体制的复归。统一管理社会商业的根本任务，应是从宏观上对全社会各种经济形式、各种组织形式的商品经营者的购销活动、利益分配进行统筹、协调、服务和监督，富有建设性地创造有利于商品流通顺畅运行的条件，创造有利生产、有利消费、有利整个国民经济正常运转的市场环境。从这种意义上说，建立统一管理社会商业和市场活动的新体制，不仅是当前整顿经济秩序的重要内容，也是全面深化改革、建立社会主义商品经济新秩序的重要内容。因此，如何把握“统一管理”的原则和目标，是个十分重要的问题。
    国家对社会商业和市场活动实施管理应当体现“管理统一，法人平等”的原则。就是说，国家对商品经营者及其市场行为实施的统一管理，无论是使用经济手段、法律手段抑或行政手段，对各个部门、各个地区、各种经济形式的商品经营者都应具有同等的效力，使他们处于同等的法人地位，能够在平等的市场条件下开展竞争。中央和地方政府在统一管理的权限上当然应当有所划分，但无论哪一级政府的管理都必须在政企分开的前提下贯彻“统一、平等”的原则。除对“老、少、边、贫、特”等地区可以制定某些灵活政策外，一般不应允许在商品流通、市场行为问题上随便“给政策”、搞特殊，在法令法规问题上不允许搞什么“变通”。在这方面，协调、规范各级政府、各个业务主管部门的管理行为，解决好“部门林立，政出多门”问题，至关重要。
    对社会商业和市场活动实施统一管理的重要目标之一是规范市场行为。为此，必须尽快建立健全一整套有关商品流通、市场行为的法令法规。“越是开放搞活，越要加强管理”，不能只停留在会议桌上，而应具体化为各种规章、条例，具有可操作性和可衡量性。当前，除已颁布实施的《企业法》、《经济合同法》、《商标法》、《广告管理暂行条例》等法令法规外，迫切需要制订《商业法》、《反垄断法》、《保护消费者利益法》、《价格法》、《金融法》、《票据法》等法令法规。一时难以成熟的，不妨先行颁布暂行条例。鉴于我国是个农业大国，农民的经济利益又经常受到市场活动的侵犯，还可考虑专门制订《农民市场利益法》之类的法规。凡已颁布实施的法令法规，应当切实提供独立于行政之外的司法保证，及时惩处各种违法行为。
    稳定市场局势也是对社会商业和市场活动实施统一管理的一个重要目标。在这方面，最重要的是组织好关乎稳定市场大局的重要商品的流通。所谓“关乎稳定市场大局的重要商品”应同时具备两个条件：它们必定是较长时期内供不应求或极易出现供不应求的紧缺型商品；它们同时是关系国计民生的重要商品。这类商品品种并不多，但它们或者是人们基本的生存资料如粮食，或者是农业生产基本的生产资料如化肥、农膜，或者是加工工业的基本原材料如钢材、棉花，或者是关系资源永续利用的资源约束型产品如木材，或者是对国家财政收入有重要影响的特殊商品如黄金、卷烟等。根据供求情况，因时制宜地将这些“重要的少数”从“一般的多数”中分离出来，对其流通在价格、信贷、税收、购销方式、购销渠道等方面实施配套的计划管理和行政管理，既很必要，也不困难。这样做了，保证重要资源的合理配置，保证人民生活的基本稳定，防止出现杀鸡取蛋式的资源破坏型经营，防止某些民间集团或个人获取巨额超额利润，防止出现市场物价的大幅度波动，市场就会基本稳定的。这既是“短缺经济”条件下经济正常运转的主要条件之一，也直接关系到社会分配的公平性。
    要对社会商业和市场行为实行统一的国家管理，或者说，要建立起适应商品流通新格局的商业管理体制，就必须建立权威性的管理社会商业、市场活动的政府机构。在这个方面，应当调查研究，总结经验，提出科学的设计，作出科学的决策。
