Li Peng, during his participation in the discussion with the Liaoning delegation, emphasized that the most important task in economic rectification is to adjust the industrial and investment structures.

Li Peng stated today during the discussion with the Liaoning delegation at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress that the purpose of rectifying the economic environment and economic order is to appropriately reduce the growth rates of production, basic construction scale, and consumption funds, thereby balancing social total supply and demand.

Li Peng said that during the rectification process, it is important to avoid excessive reduction in economic growth rates. The growth rate can be reduced to an appropriate level, such as 8%, 7%, or even 6%. If a 6% growth rate can be maintained, China's total industrial and agricultural output can still double by the end of the century.

The Premier said, "We do not want the growth rates of sectors that are already weak in the national economy, such as energy, transportation, raw materials, and agricultural production, to be reduced too much. Otherwise, it will increase the difficulty of rectification." He believes that this should be avoided. However, he added, it is also impossible to achieve significant growth in these weak sectors during rectification. Developing energy, transportation, raw materials, and agriculture is a long-term task.

Li Peng pointed out that without adjusting the structure, rectification will be difficult to achieve results. He emphasized that adjusting the structure is a challenging task. Both industrial structure and fixed asset investment structure need to be adjusted simultaneously. He said that when formulating adjustment plans, the principle should be to support what needs to be supported and not support what should not be supported. He believes that only in this way can the national economy develop in a stable and healthy manner.

　　李鹏参加辽宁代表团讨论时指出        
    治理整顿调整结构最重要
    经济薄弱环节的发展速度不能降得过多
    据新华社北京３月２５日电  国务院总理李鹏今天在这里说，治理整顿的一项最重要的任务，就是要调整好产业结构和投资结构。
    李鹏今天在参加七届全国人大二次会议辽宁代表团的讨论时说，治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的目的，就是要把包括生产增长、基本建设规模和消费基金膨胀的速度适当降低，从而使社会总供给和社会总需求趋于平衡。
    李鹏说，在治理整顿过程中要避免经济发展速度降低过多，要降到一个适当的程度，如降到８％、７％、甚至６％，也是可以的。如果能保持６％的速度增长，到本世纪末，中国的工农业总产值还是可以翻两番的。
    这位总理说：“我们不希望把一些本来在国民经济中就很薄弱的环节，如能源、交通、原材料和农业生产发展的速度降得过多。否则，就会增加治理整顿的难度。”他认为，这也是应该避免的。但是，他又说，要想在治理整顿中使这些薄弱环节有大幅度的增长，也是不可能的。发展能源、交通、原材料和农业，是一项长期的任务。
    李鹏指出，如果不调整好结构，治理整顿就难以取得成效。他强调说，调整结构是一项艰巨的任务。既要调整产业结构，又要调整固定资产投资结构，两者要同时进行。他说，在制定调整方案时，要体现这样一个原则，即有的要保，有的要压，该支持的支持，不该支持的则不能支持。他认为，这样才能使国民经济得以稳定、健康地发展。
