Column: People's Forum

Comrade Deng Xiaoping once said, "The more people in the Party and among the masses who are willing to think and ponder, the better it is for our cause." There are many such people now. Many ordinary people are watching the changing landscape brought about by reform and opening up, and they have a sense of excitement and a strong desire to express their views as masters of the country. The "People's Forum" is timely, providing a platform for those who "think and ponder" to speak out and encouraging more people to do the same. This will undoubtedly be beneficial to our cause.

What should the "People's Forum" discuss? The editors said in the opening remarks, "Any issue in the fields of society, economy, politics, culture, and education can be discussed." This refers to the scope of discussion, and my understanding is that "there are no restrictions on the topics." Although it is said this way, I think there may still be a problem of "what to say." This matter is "sensitive," so let's avoid it; that issue has not yet been decided, so let's set it aside for now; this is something that an authority has already commented on, so don't say anything more... If the editors and authors are burdened with such heavy baggage, the forum can only repeat well-known conclusions and lack originality. However, reality always presents sharp problems that force people to answer. If we evade the issue and do not speak from the heart, what use is a mouthpiece? If we do not speak to the point, discussions and debates will be chaotic. Therefore, "being close to reality, daring to speak the truth, and opening up channels for expression" should be the biggest feature of this column. Of course, there are still many voices that are not beneficial to our cause, but those are not the voices of the people. The mouthpiece of the Party and the people should never emit such sounds.

I believe that when the people frequently discuss issues in the Party's newspapers, it has at least two benefits: First, it helps people understand the changes in the society they live in, either to be inspired and encouraged, or to be alerted and reflect, thereby innovating and advancing more spiritedly; second, it helps politicians and decision-makers continuously examine and understand the pros and cons of national policies, from the top to the bottom, and use them as references for decision-making.

Those who "think and ponder" often see problems when they look at society. They fully affirm the achievements but do not overlook the problems. The prominent social problems today, such as unhealthy trends and corruption, are indeed worrying and make those with a conscience unable to ignore them. Loudly calling out, advising good and preventing evil, sincerely offering advice, and starting with oneself, expressing inner concerns and forming a strong public opinion, intervening in life and seeing results, and promoting the health of the social body, this discussion will not be in vain.

Of course, the majority of the people are not experts, but their advantage is that they are straightforward and unpretentious. They are not confined to fixed patterns and often start from personal feelings, making their discussions fresh like morning dew. They propose new ideas and creative suggestions, perhaps they talked about one aspect but did not consider the other. This is fine because there has never been an absolutely "comprehensive" theory. "Literature is an eternal matter, gains and losses are known by the heart." The power of public opinion is limited after all, and phrases like "one word can revive a nation" are exaggerated for great people. As long as there is something valuable in the words of the common people, it is worth welcoming as "one person's opinion." This one person's opinion, if kept in the stomach, will have no effect and may even make the person sick. Chatting privately is also of little use, but if it is expressed through one's own mouthpiece—the Party's newspaper—it may be able to join the collective effort to push society forward.

I like and look forward to the "People's Forum." I have expressed some opinions, which are also one person's opinion.

### 人民心声情最真——写给《人民论坛》

　　人民心声情最真        
    ——写给《人民论坛》
    小平同志说过：“在党内和人民群众中，肯动脑筋，肯想问题的人愈多，对我们的事业就愈有利。”现在这样的人不少，很多普通百姓注视着改革开放所引起的变幻的风云，都有一种主人翁的亢奋的参与意识和焦灼的表达愿望。《人民论坛》恰逢其时，给那些“肯动脑筋，肯想问题”的人提供了一块发言的园地，并将带动更多的人去“动脑筋”、“想问题”，这对于我们的事业肯定会大有裨益。
    《人民论坛》论什么好？编者在“开场”白中说，“举凡社会、经济、政治、文化、教育各个领域的问题均可”。这是就议论范围而言，我的理解，即“题材无限制”。话虽这么说，但我考虑也许仍存在一个“说什么”的难题。这件事“敏感”，回避了吧；那个问题尚无定论，暂且搁置；这是某权威表过态的，不要再说三道四了……如果编者、作者都背着如此沉重的包袱，那论坛也就只能重复现成的、众所周知的结论而见不到新意了。可现实总是将尖锐的问题推到人们面前逼人回答。顾左右而言他，不道心声，要喉舌何用？言不及义，讨论争鸣也是乱弹。所以，“贴近现实，敢讲真话，广开言路”，应该是本栏最大的特色。当然，不利于我们事业的聒噪仍然未绝，但那不是人民心声，党和人民的喉舌什么时候也不能放出那种声音。
    人民群众在党报频发议论，我看至少有两利：一利于人们了解大家生存于其中的社会相的变化，或受到鼓舞、鞭策，或引起警觉、反思，从而革故鼎新，更加精神振奋地前进；二利于政治家、决策者不断从中考察、了解上自国家大政方针之得失，下至平民百姓的情绪和呼声，以之为决策的参考。
    “肯动脑筋”的人看社会，往往是“肯想问题”，他们看到成绩充分肯定，但也不放过问题。当下突出的社会问题，如不正之风、腐败现象等，实在令人忧心，使稍有良心者欲置之度外而不能。大声疾呼呀，劝善戒恶呀，竭诚献策呀，“从我做起”呀，患于中而发于外，形成强大的舆论，干预生活并见实绩，促使社会机体走向健全，这议论才算没有空发。
    当然，人民群众的大多数并不是专家，但他们的优点则是率直而不加矫饰。他们不囿于固定模式，多从切身感受出发，议论带有春风朝露般的清新气息。他们提出新鲜观点、创造性建议，也许说了这一方面，没顾上另一方面。这也不要紧，因为从来就没有什么绝对“全面”的理论。“文章千古事，得失寸心知”。舆论干预的力量毕竟有限，什么“一言可以兴邦”之类的话，对于伟人来说是夸大其辞。老百姓的话只要有一点可取之处，就不失“一家之言”，就值得欢迎。这一家言，装在肚子里什么作用也起不了，还可能把人憋坏，私下里唠叨也好处无多，而通过自己的喉舌——党报喷发出来，也许就能汇入推动社会前进的合力中去。
    我喜欢并寄望于“人民论坛”，发了点议论，也算一家之言吧。
