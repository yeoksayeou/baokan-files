Due to years of continuous warfare, Uganda once faced severe difficulties. Under the leadership of President Museveni, the Ugandan people have made strenuous efforts over three years and finally welcomed peace and stability.

When Museveni took office in January 1986, Uganda's economy was on the brink of collapse. Facing the aftermath of war, the Museveni government adopted a policy of stabilizing the political situation and vigorously developing the economy, which quickly turned around the domestic economy. In the fiscal year from July 1987 to June 1988, the country's Gross Domestic Product grew by 6%, with agriculture increasing by 8% to 10%, manufacturing by 20%, and construction by 14%.

Uganda's economic recovery achieved such remarkable results in just three years mainly because the government adopted policies suited to the country's conditions. President Museveni has pointed out that Uganda neither practices socialism nor capitalism. Based on Uganda's national conditions, he formulated an economic development policy of primarily private enterprise, supplemented by state-owned enterprises, and a combination of public and private sectors.

　　实行符合国情政策        
    乌干达振兴经济成绩显著
    新华社坎帕拉３月２０日电  （记者白景山、张颖生）由于连年战乱，乌干达一度困难重重。在穆塞韦尼总统领导下，乌干达人民经过３年艰苦的努力，终于迎来了和平和稳定。
    穆塞韦尼１９８６年１月执政之初，乌干达民生凋敝，经济濒于崩溃。面对满目的战争创伤，穆塞韦尼政府采取努力稳定政局、大力发展经济的方针，使国内经济很快出现转机。在１９８７年７月至１９８８年６月的财政年度，国内生产总值增长６％，其中农业增长８％至１０％，制造业增长２０％，建筑业增长１４％。
    乌干达经济恢复在短短３年里能取得这样显著的成绩，主要是由于政府采取了符合国情的政策。穆塞韦尼总统曾指出，乌干达既不搞社会主义，也不搞资本主义。他根据乌干达本国国情，制订了以私营为主、国营为辅、公私并举的经济发展方针。
