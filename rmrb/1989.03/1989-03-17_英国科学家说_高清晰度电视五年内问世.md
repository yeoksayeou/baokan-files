Xinhua News Agency, London, March 15th.

British scientists recently said at a discussion held here that high-definition television sets may be available within five years.

High-definition television sets mark a revolutionary change in television quality, comparable to the transition from black-and-white to color television.

The European Community, Japan, and the United States all regard the development of high-definition television sets as a key to the advancement of the electronics industry.

High-definition television images have double the horizontal scanning lines of ordinary television, making them as clear as watching a movie.

The aspect ratio of high-definition television screens, both in width and height, is closer to that of movie screens, at 16:9, while ordinary television screens are 4:3.

High-definition television images contain four times the information of ordinary television images.

The first European demonstration of high-definition television was held last autumn at the International Broadcasting Convention in Brighton, UK. It had 1,250 horizontal scanning lines, compared to the 625 lines of ordinary television.

　　英国科学家说
    高清晰度电视五年内问世
    新华社伦敦３月１５日电  英国科学家最近在这里举行的一次讨论会上说，高清晰度电视机可能在５年内问世。
    高清晰度电视机标志着电视质量的革命，这次革命可以同黑白电视向彩色电视转变相媲美。
    欧洲共同体、日本和美国都把高清晰度电视机的研制视成电子工业发展的关键。
    高清晰度电视图像的水平扫描线比普通电视增加一倍，看起来同看电影一样清楚。
    高清晰度电视机屏幕的宽度和高度的比例接近于电影屏幕，为１６比９，而现在普通电视机屏幕为４比３。
    高清晰度电视图像含有的信息量比普通电视图像信息量大４倍。
    欧洲高清晰度电视的第一次表演是去年秋天在英国布赖顿举行的国际广播大会上进行的，它有１２５０条水平扫描线，而普通电视只有６２５条。
