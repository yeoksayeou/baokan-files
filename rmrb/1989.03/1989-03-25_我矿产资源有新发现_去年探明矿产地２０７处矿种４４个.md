China has achieved significant results in geological exploration. According to statistics from the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, 207 new industrial mineral deposits were discovered nationwide last year, encompassing 44 different types of minerals.

Experts have confirmed that among these newly discovered mineral deposits, 34 are of large-scale mine size, and 46 meet the standards for medium-sized mines. The white card lead-zinc mine in Qiaojia, Yunnan, covers an area of 8 square kilometers with significant potential reserves, making it the largest and richest lead-zinc deposit discovered in recent years. The large-scale bauxite deposits in Xiaoyi, Jiaokou, and Yuanping in Shanxi Province have estimated geological reserves of up to 80 million tons. The diatomite deposit in Tengchong, Yunnan, has estimated reserves exceeding 1 billion tons, equivalent to 20 large-scale mines, making it the largest diatomite deposit discovered in the world to date.

It is reported that last year, 65 types of minerals saw an increase in proven reserves nationwide. Among these, significant increases were noted in gold, silver, aluminum, lead-zinc, titanium, rare earth, kaolin, diatomite, and tremolite mines. Preliminary calculations for the newly increased proven reserves of 40 types of minerals indicate a potential value of 30.28 billion yuan, equivalent to 133 times the total investment in geological exploration by the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources in 1988.

　　我矿产资源有新发现        
    去年探明矿产地２０７处矿种４４个
    新华社北京３月２４日电  （记者赵明亮）我国地质勘探又获重大成果。据地质矿产部统计，去年全国新发现工业矿床的矿产地有２０７处，矿种４４个。
    经专家证实，这些新发现的矿产地中有３４处达到大型矿规模，４６处符合中型矿标准。云南巧家白卡铅锌矿矿区范围达８平方公里，远景储量可观，是近年来新发现的规模最大、品位最富的铅锌矿床。山西孝义、交口、原平三个大型铝土矿床，预测地质储量可达８０００万吨。云南腾冲硅灰石矿床预测储量在１亿吨以上，相当２０个大型矿床，是目前世界上发现的规模最大的硅灰石矿床。
    据介绍，去年全国新增加探明储量的矿产有６５种，其中新增储量较大的有金、银、铝、铅锌、钛、稀土、高岭土、硅灰石和透辉石矿等。据对４０种矿产新增探明储量的初步测算，潜在价值达３０２８亿元，相当于１９８８年地矿部门地质勘探费总投资的１３３倍。
