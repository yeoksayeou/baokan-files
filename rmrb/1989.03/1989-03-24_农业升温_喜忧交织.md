Title: Agriculture Warms Up: Mixed Feelings

Several representatives from Hunan discussed agricultural issues and expressed a mix of joy and concern. One representative's words were quite representative: "Agriculture is warming up, but currently, it's only warming up on paper and in words, not in the fields." Wang Lianfu, a representative of the National People's Congress and the director of the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Economy Commission, said, "Last year, the province issued 90 million yuan in white receipts for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products, and by the end of February, 40 million yuan had not been redeemed. What will the farmers store? How will the province invest? Some inputs for production materials may also decrease, such as the province's small-scale fertilizer production, which will decrease by 360,000 tons this year."

Yuan Dongwu, the party secretary of Shanguan Village in Linxiang County, explained the problem from a grassroots perspective. He said, "The state assigns tasks to farmers, and each level adds a bit more; while the state's investment in agriculture, each level cuts a bit off. We are like carrying straw in the rain—the heavier it gets. Since the contracted purchase of grain is a mandatory plan, can we also establish an 'investment law' to make agricultural investment a mandatory task?"

This year, the prices of 14 major agricultural production materials in Hunan have all increased. Mayor Wang Keying of Changsha used Wangcheng County as an example: "This county's grain price increase actually increased revenue by 4.669 million yuan, but this year, just the price increase of ammonium carbonate will require an additional 6.695 million yuan, which will not only offset the benefits to farmers but also be insufficient."

Some representatives said that the state's demand for grain is passed down through counties, townships, and villages, but credit, energy, and production materials are passed down through "vertical" channels, and "horizontal" authorities have no say. Everything related to agriculture requires incense and prayers, and farmers describe it as: "What is visible cannot be managed, and what can be managed is not visible. There are benefits to be collected, and there are burdens to be passed down." Yuan Dongwu said, "Agriculture needs to warm up, and power needs to be delegated."

　　农业升温　喜忧交织
    本报记者  朱维群
    几位湖南代表谈农业问题时，普遍的感觉是喜忧交织。一位代表的话颇具代表性：“农业要升温，但现在是只是升在纸面和嘴巴上，还没有升在田里。”人大代表、湖南省农经委主任王连福说：“去年全省收购农副产品开出白条子金额９０００万元，到２月底还有４０００万未兑现。农民拿什么储？省里又拿什么投？有些生产资料投入也可能下降，如本省小化肥今年将减产３６万吨。”
    临湘县上源村党支部书记元东吾则从基层角度说明问题。他说：“国家给农民下任务，层层都要加一点；而国家对农业投入，层层都要截一点。我们是下雨天担稻草——越担越重。既然合同定购粮是指令性计划，能不能也立个‘投入法’，把农业投入也搞成硬性任务。”
    今年湖南１４种主要农业生产资料全部涨价。长沙市市长王克英以望城县为例说：“这个县粮食提价实际增收４６６．９万元，但是今年仅碳铵一项涨价就要多支出６６９．５万元，将农民获益全部抵消还不够。”
    有的代表说，国家要粮是通过县、乡、村向下要的，但是信贷、能源、生产资料等是通过“条条”下来的，“块块”做不了主。办农业事事得烧香拜佛，农民形容：“看得见的管不着，管得着的看不见”，“有利益就上收，有包袱就下放”。元东吾说：“农业要升温，权力就得下放。”
