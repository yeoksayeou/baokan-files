The road silently endures both love and hatred, praise and curses. It bears the weight of passing wheels, the tread of footsteps, the rhythmic songs of laborers, and the tears of sorrow. Yet, you are a clarion call, rallying the thirsty and the eager into battle. You are a muse, guiding steadfast lovers on their journey. You are a just judge, awarding each contestant their rightful score.

You are formless, but the pioneers with hearts of courage forge you through thorny thickets and desolate wastelands, making you tangible. You persist through new ideas and aspirations, through triumphs and failures, shining like a beacon and inspiring like a tape recording.

Indeed, the rain of evil and the winds of the world may twist you into a confusing fork, even leading to a quagmire. But you are also a patient and guiding mother, nurturing fledglings and watching them soar into the clear sky. You mark each treacherous stretch with a prominent sign—“!”

Oh, road, may your extension become a fluttering banner, beckoning every vibrant youth to stride towards a golden season! May every traveler discern each road's marker in the colorful mist, heed the road's every warning, and take the first step on their thousand-mile journey.

　　路
    默默地默默地承受爱也承受恨，承受礼赞也承受诅咒……任车轮轧过去，任步履踏过去，任声声夯歌在你背上叩响，也任滴滴苦泪在你身边忏悔。
    但你毕竟是一支号角，催渴求的方阵出征；毕竟是一尊缪斯，使忠贞的恋侣阔步；毕竟是一位公正的裁判，给每一名参赛者亮出他应有的得分！
    你本无形，但有心的开拓者在无人问津令人畏缩的荆棘与荒漠中终于辟出有形的你。你便在新的构思新的攀求中延续，在成功与失败的较量中，你神奇如一盏亮灿灿的标灯，也神奇如一盒启迪后人的磁带……
    诚然，邪恶的雨世俗的风，把你铸成令人迷惘的支岔，甚至通向一方泥潭……但你又似一位循循善诱的慈母，将只只乳燕开导，且笑送它们飞上晴朗的天空。你在每节险段树起一块醒目的符号——“！”
    路呵，但愿你的延伸化作猎猎旌旗——招引每一棵活动的青春树走向金色的季节！更愿每一位跋涉者在五彩缤纷的迷雾里明辨每一条路的标记，铭记路的每一句忠告，迈好千里征程的第一步。
