In 1961, on May Day, Chairman Mao came to Shanghai. I, along with various Shanghai figures, including Chen Wangdao, Shen Tilan, Shen Kewei, Zhou Xinfan, Jin Zhonghua, and others, met Chairman Mao at the Jinjiang Hotel. That night, around 11 o'clock, I was already asleep at home when I received a phone call from a newspaper reporter. They asked me to write a poem or a song to be published in the next day's *Liberation Daily* to welcome Chairman Mao. I firmly declined, saying I couldn't write anything. The reporter insisted, saying, "It doesn't matter, the requirements are not high, just write one." I said, "Chairman Mao is an expert, the requirements cannot be low." Since I couldn't refuse, I reluctantly wrote one, titled *Meeting Chairman Mao on May Day*, set to the tune of *Xian Zhong Xin*, which reads:

    "This life is fortunate, early basking in spring breeze.
    Cleansing old stains, like rebirth.
    Again this time, listening to his guidance,
    For scholarship, all that is reasonable, should be debated.
    Emotions not yet over, enthusiasm surging,
    Night deep, still receiving his earnest teachings.
    Just at this festive season, the earth rejoices.
    People's hearts are content, all are advancing,
    Do not follow old ways."

Chairman Mao saw this poem and called me. On May 3rd at 3 PM, I went to Chairman Mao's residence. He was sitting in the living room reading the newspaper. I walked into the living room alone, and Chairman Mao stood up and said his first words:

    "One poem, I've seen it, but there must be more than one, right?"

I said, "Only one, I have never published poetry or songs in the newspaper before, this is indeed the first."

Chairman Mao said, "There must be more than one." Meaning to say, I am also like someone who often writes these things. I immediately relayed what I had said to the reporter, "Chairman Mao is an expert, the requirements cannot be low."

Chairman Mao smiled and said, "Chairman Mao is only that much of an expert."

I said, "Usually, I occasionally write a few lines, that's just dabbling in poetry."

Chairman Mao said, "What's wrong with dabbling in poetry?"

I said, "Those who dabble in poetry are just venting their grievances."

Chairman Mao said, "What's wrong with venting grievances? If you don't vent your grievances, can you live?"

At this point, I relayed someone else's opinion to Chairman Mao, saying:

    "It is said that Qu Yuan's *Li Sao* is also a venting of grievances, saying that 'Li' and 'Lao' are homophones."

Chairman Mao said, "It might be so, but it might not necessarily be."

I then expressed my own opinion, saying, "Li Sao might be a venting of grievances, a venting of grievances might be just talking nonsense. Lao and Luo are homophones, and Sao and Suo are also homophones. Saying Luo Suo, might just be venting grievances." What I said had no basis, but Chairman Mao still smiled and did not say I was being absurd. I further said, smiling, "Chairman Mao teaches us to speak with wit, we really should pay attention."

Chairman Mao said, "Yes! Always being dry, what's the fun in that?" I said, smiling, "Recently, I found an explanation for 'wit': when wisdom exceeds need, there might be wit; when wisdom cannot meet the need, not only can there be no wit, it might even be embarrassing."

It was already 6 PM, and my conversation with Chairman Mao was not yet over. Later, we turned to talking about politics. I happened to mention Mr. Deng Yanda, and Chairman Mao immediately asked me, "Do you know Deng?" I said, "I know him." Chairman Mao said, "Mr. Deng Yanda is a good person, I like this person." At this point, Chairman Mao and I had dinner at a small table. After dinner, I took my leave and returned home, and Chairman Mao escorted me to the car.

This was in May 1961. By 1965, I saw Chairman Mao again in a old-style villa in the western suburbs of Shanghai. As soon as I entered the door, Chairman Mao stood up smiling and said, "We meet again." "We meet again" were the words Chairman Mao often used when he first saw me. This time, Chen Pishan was also present. After I greeted Chairman Mao and shook hands, we immediately engaged in a lively conversation. The range of our conversation was quite broad. Talking about the history of philosophy, Chairman Mao said, "Hu Shi's *History of Chinese Philosophy* only wrote half of it, and there was no continuation." I said, "Hu's *History of Chinese Literature* also only wrote half of it, and there was no continuation." Chairman Mao then talked about "No one has written the *History of Chinese Buddhism*, which is also a problem."

Regarding classical poetry, we talked about Li Shangyin; I immediately forgot myself and casually hummed a seven-character quatrain by Li Shangyin in Hunan dialect, which goes:

    "Beyond the seas, we only hear of nine provinces,
    This life uncertain, the next life unknown.
    We only hear the tiger soldiers' night watch,
    No more rooster calls to announce the dawn.
    This day, the six armies are stationed together,
    At that time, the seventh night, laughing at the cowherd."

I hummed the fifth and sixth lines a few times, but I couldn't hum the seventh and eighth lines. Chairman Mao knew I had forgotten, so he smiled and recited them for me, saying, "How can four generations be the son of heaven, not as good as Lu's Moqiu." When Chairman Mao recited them, I hummed along after him. For a moment, the mood was relaxed, beyond the ordinary. Who would have thought that this would be the last time. After this, except for hearing Chairman Mao's speech recording once, I never had the opportunity to personally receive his teachings again!

### 与毛主席谈诗词

　　与毛主席谈诗词
    周谷城
    １９６１年五一节，毛主席来到了上海，我同上海各界，其中有陈望道、沈体兰、沈克非、周信芳、金仲华……等人，在锦江饭店楼下晋见了毛主席。这天晚上，大约１１点钟左右，我在家里已经睡了，忽接报馆记者的电话，要我写一首诗或一首词，在第二天的《解放日报》上发表，以欢迎毛主席。我坚决推谢，说写不出。记者强求说：“不要紧，要求不高，写一首好了。”我说“主席是内行，要求不能不高。”因推辞不了，勉强写了一首，题目叫《五一节晋见毛主席》，调寄《献衷心》，词曰：
    “是此身多幸，早沐春风。蠲旧染，若新生。又这回倾听，指点重重：为学术，凡有理，要争鸣。
    情未已，兴偏浓，夜阑犹在诲谆谆。况正逢佳节，大地欢腾。人意泰，都奋进，莫因循。”
    毛主席见了这首词后，便打电话召我。５月３日下午３时，我到毛主席的住处，他正坐在客厅里看报。我一人走进客厅，毛主席起来第一句话即说：
    “词一首，看到了，怕不止一首吧！”
    我说：“只有一首，我从来没有在报上发表过诗词，这确是第一首。”
    毛主席说：“总怕不止一首。”意思就是说我也像个常常写这些东西的人。我随即转述我对记者说的那句话，“主席是内行，要求不能不高。”
    毛主席笑着说：“主席也只有那么内行。”
    我又说：“平时，我也偶然写几句，那是附庸风雅。”
    毛主席说：“附庸风雅有什么坏处？”
    我说：“附庸风雅的人，无非是发发牢骚而已。”
    毛主席说：“发牢骚有什么不好？有牢骚不发，过得吗？”
    谈至此，我又向毛主席转述别人的意见，专讲字义，说：
    “据说，屈原的《离骚》就是牢骚，说是‘离’‘牢’同声。”
    毛主席说：“可能是这样，但也未必一定。”我于是进一步发表自己的意见说：“离骚可能就是牢骚，牢骚可能就是罗唆。牢罗同声，骚唆也是同声。念罗唆，可能就是发牢骚。”我所说的并没有什么根据，但主席仍微笑着，没有说我荒唐。我更进一步笑着说：“主席教我们说话要风趣，真该好好注意。”
    毛主席说：“是呀！老是干巴巴，有什么味。”我又笑着说：“我近来替‘风趣’找出了一种解释：智慧超过需要时，可能有风趣；智慧赶不上需要时，不仅不能有风趣，可能要丢丑。”
    已是六点钟了，我同毛主席的谈话还没有完。后来转而谈政治。我偶然提及了邓演达先生，毛主席随即问我：“你认识邓？”我说：“我认识。”毛主席说：“邓演达先生这个人很好，我很喜欢这个人。”谈至此，毛主席同我在一个小桌子上吃晚饭。饭后，我即告辞回家，毛主席一直把我送到汽车上。
    这是１９６１年５月的事。到１９６５年，我又在上海西郊一个旧式的别墅里见了毛主席。我一进门，毛主席即起而笑着说：“又碰到了。”“又碰到了”这几个字，是毛主席每次见到我的时候第一句常用的话。这次在座的，有陈丕显同志。我同毛主席握手问好之后，随即转入畅谈。谈话的范围真够广了。谈到哲学史，毛主席说：“胡适之的中国哲学史，只写了一半，就没有下文了。”我说：“胡的白话文学史，也只写了一半，就没有下文。”毛主席又谈到“中国佛教史没有人写，也是一个问题。”
    关于旧体诗，我们谈到了李商隐；我当即忘乎所以，随便把李商隐的一首七言律诗，用湖南腔调哼起来，曰：
    海外徒闻更九州，他生未卜此生休。空闻虎旅鸣宵柝，无复鸡人报晓筹。此日六军同驻马，当时七夕笑牵牛。
    把五六两句哼了几遍，七八两句居然哼不出来。毛主席知我已忘记了，他便笑着，自己代我念出，曰：“如何四纪为天子，不及卢家有莫愁。”毛主席念出时，我又跟着他的后面哼。一时心情舒畅，超出寻常。万万料想不到，这竟是最后的一次。这一次后，除了听过毛主席一次讲话录音外，再没有机会亲聆他的教益了！
