Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 28th. People's Daily reporters Huang Wei and Wang Yougong report: As International Women's Day approaches, the Chinese Academy of Sciences held a symposium titled "Reflections and Hopes of Female Technologists."

Representatives at the symposium included veteran female scientists from China, middle-aged female technologists who participated in key national research projects such as the electron-positron collider accelerator, the agricultural Yellow-Huai-Hai campaign, and Antarctic expeditions, as well as young female technicians who have achieved success in their ordinary technological posts. They openly discussed their experiences of overcoming various difficulties in work and family life to achieve success in their careers.

Standing Committee member of the National People's Congress and chairwoman of the All-China Women's Federation, Chen Muxia, praised them, saying, "Your achievements in work are a source of pride for us women. Women not only engage in social work but also bear the responsibility of household chores. Carrying two burdens, you have paid more labor, which should be recognized and understood by society."

　　“三八”节前女科技人员谈甘苦
    妇女劳动需要社会公认
    本报北京２月２８日讯  新华社记者黄威、本报记者王友恭报道：“三八”妇女节来临之际，中国科学院召开“女科技人员的思考与希望”座谈会。
    出席座谈会的女科技工作者代表中，有我国老一辈女科学家，有参加电子对撞机加速器、农业黄淮海战役、南极考察等国家重点科研项目的中年女科技人员，还有在平凡科技岗位上做出成绩的青年女技术人员。她们畅谈了自己如何克服工作和家庭的种种困难，在事业上有所作为的经历。全国人大常委会副委员长、全国妇联主席陈慕华赞扬她们说，你们在工作上取得的成就，是我们女同志的骄傲。女同志既要从事社会工作，又要承担家务，两副担子一起挑，付出的劳动是比较多的，这应该得到社会的公认和理解。
