Last June, when our city's leaders went to the countryside, they discovered that in some rural areas, many students were betrothed by their parents. Upon learning of this situation, the municipal Party committee and government instructed relevant departments to take joint measures to liberate these "child betrothals." The measures taken include: first, incorporating ideological and moral education as an important component of school political classes, guiding students to consciously resist early marriage and romantic relationships; second, using various forms to widely propagate the benefits of late marriage and late childbearing and the harms of early marriage and childbearing; third, making the resistance against arranging "child betrothals" an important component in the selection of civilized villages, civilized families, civilized schools, and civilized individuals, thereby closely coordinating society, families, and schools to work together to change old customs and establish new norms.

Over the past half year, this city has already had 21 students voluntarily annul their engagements.

　　莱阳市解放“娃娃亲”
    去年６月，我市领导人下乡时，发现一些农村不少在校学生由家长做主，订了“娃娃亲”。了解到这一情况后，市委、市政府责成有关部门联合采取措施，解放这些“娃娃亲”。采取的措施：一是把理想道德教育作为学校政治课的一项重要内容，引导学生自觉抵制早婚早恋；二是利用多种形式，广泛宣讲晚婚晚育的好处和早婚早育的害处；三是把抵制订“娃娃亲”，作为评选文明村、文明家庭、文明学校、文明个人的一项重要内容，使得社会、家庭、学校密切配合起来，共同改旧俗，树新风。
    半年多来，这个市已有２１名在校学生主动解除了婚约。
