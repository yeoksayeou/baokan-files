The scenic wonder of Yanzidong in South Yunnan has recently opened to the public, attracting tens of thousands of Chinese and foreign tourists daily who come to enjoy the sights.

Yanzidong is located between Jianshui County in South Yunnan and the famous tin city of Gejiu, about 220 kilometers from Kunming. Standing tens of meters high, it is majestic in appearance. The Lu River flows through the cave, with rippling waves reflecting the scenery. Boating on the river allows visitors to enter the cave for nearly 800 meters. Inside Yanzidong, there are countless stalactites, stalagmites, and stone flowers, creating a myriad of shapes and patterns that are both fascinating and bewildering. In mid-January of this year, Bulgarian cave expert Dr. T. Beron, who has surveyed over 60 countries, visited Yanzidong and commented, "Yanzidong is one of the most magnificent and spacious caves in the world."

　　滇南奇景燕子洞开放
    据新华社昆明３月２８日电  （记者李承祖、刘远达）滇南奇景燕子洞最近正式对外开放，每天都有成千上万的中外游客来到这里，乘兴游览。
    燕子洞在滇南建水县至著名的锡都个旧市之间，距昆明２２０多公里，它高数十米，气势恢宏，泸水河从洞中穿过，碧波涟涟。河上荡舟，可直入洞内近８００米。燕子洞内到处是石笋、石树、石花，变化万端，扑朔迷离。今年１月中旬，曾考察过６０多个国家的保加利亚著名洞穴专家特·贝龙博士游览了燕子洞后评价说：“燕子洞是世界上最壮观、空间最大的洞穴之一。”
