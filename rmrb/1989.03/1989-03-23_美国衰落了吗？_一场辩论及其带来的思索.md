**Has America Declined?**
**A Debate and Its Reflections**

**By Cang Lide, People's Daily Reporter**

Is America destined to repeat the history of the Spanish Empire, Napoleonic Empire, British Empire, and other great powers that rose and fell over the past 500 years? What changes will America's international status undergo in the 21st century? The publication of Paul Kennedy's "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" at the beginning of last year sparked a nationwide debate in America that continues to this day. People have presented their views, attempting to answer or reflect on the questions raised in the book from different angles.

The focus of the debate is whether America has declined. "Say goodbye to the first kiss, fellow countrymen!" "America is coming to Europe!" "Japan, the rising superpower, is emerging as a major player!" — These shocking headlines appeared in several authoritative newspapers and magazines. In the eyes of those who believe in America's decline, the country's international status has clearly diminished since World War II. The main arguments are as follows: In terms of the economy, America's share of the world's gross national product has dropped from 50% in the early post-war period to 25% today. America has gone from being the world's largest creditor to the largest debtor, with severe trade and fiscal deficits. Japan and Western Europe are poised to challenge America's dominance. In terms of military power, the Soviet Union has reached parity with America; the rise of regional powers poses an increasing threat to America's national security. In terms of technology, America's post-war monopoly has been shaken, with Japan and Western Europe catching up or even surpassing America in some cutting-edge technologies. In the international relations landscape, "the most striking change in the world today is the decline of the superpowers" (Kissinger); the bipolar confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is shifting towards multipolarity, and so on.

Those who oppose this view argue that America has not declined and will continue to play a leading role in the world. In their eyes, America's net debt as a percentage of its gross national product is minimal, and its fiscal deficit is lower than Japan's. America's technology is still at the forefront globally. Militarily, America has recently regained its strength. The Wall Street Journal believes that the early post-war period was an "abnormal historical period," and it is understandable that America's share of the world's gross national product was abnormally high at that time. From the 1960s to the present, this share has remained at around 25%, and it is expected to rise to 30% by 2010, still double that of Japan. Currently, America plays a crucial role in the global economy. If America were to significantly reduce its trade deficit by cutting imports, it would slow down the development of countries like Japan and West Germany and potentially trigger a global economic recession. The newspaper also compared the strengths of various countries in terms of population, gross national product, average annual growth rate from 1966 to 1987, inflation rate, labor force, trade volume, energy, agriculture, military, and living standards. The conclusion is that America will retain "global leadership" from the 1990s into the next century, provided it has the "determination."

This debate is ongoing and does not require a detailed evaluation of each viewpoint. What is impressive is the strong sense of crisis among American intellectuals and the impact of the debate on the decision-making layer.

In the past, books like "The Ugly American" and "Japan as Number One" have repeatedly warned about various problems in American society. This time, the debate is like a "warning in prosperous times," sounding an alarm for America's future. After the publication of "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers," major newspapers and magazines immediately introduced it. To be fair, America currently faces no "imminent crisis." However, since the end of World War II, the balance of power among countries has changed, and the international relations landscape has evolved. How should America reassess itself? What strategies should it adopt to maintain its international status? Should it be vigilant and prevent potential dangers, or should it remain complacent and wait for "thousands of ships to pass by"? This is the background and starting point of this debate. In terms of the deeper reflections brought about by the debate, the near and far concerns of the intellectual community are not just alarmist. Many experts believe that America should review its past, understand its environment, adjust its strategies, and face the future.

During the debate, the academic and intellectual communities have published numerous books and articles, offering advice to the decision-making layer. Think tanks such as the Washington Institute for Strategic Studies and the Brookings Institution have proposed important suggestions, including: America should actively promote détente with the Soviet Union to create a lasting peaceful environment for economic development; national security strategy should shift from military competition to economic competition; pay attention to the trend of the global economic center shifting from Europe to the Asia-Pacific region and adjust diplomacy accordingly; encourage industrial investment and strengthen high-tech development; reduce overseas military forces and share the defense burden with allies; improve education quality from preschool and enhance national quality, and so on.

The American political circle highly values this debate. After taking the oath of office, President Bush repeatedly emphasized that his government's focus is on "the bright future of the next generation" and that he will be the "education president." He also called on the American people to curb the extravagant pursuit of material enjoyment and revive the tradition of hard work and entrepreneurship...

What America will look like in the next century is hard to predict. The key is, in an era of "global change" (Bush's words), how to seriously consider the future of the country and the fate of the nation. Currently, the strong sense of crisis in powerful America is indeed commendable.

### 美国衰落了吗？——一场辩论及其带来的思索

　　美国衰落了吗？         
    ——一场辩论及其带来的思索
    本报记者  仓立德
    美国注定要重演５００年来西班牙帝国、拿破仑帝国、大英帝国等强国盛极而衰的历史吗？美国在２１世纪的国际地位将发生何等变化？耶鲁大学史学教授保罗·肯尼迪的《强国的兴衰》（又译《大国的兴衰》）去年初问世后，触发了一场席卷美国朝野的辩论。这场辩论至今仍在进行。人们各陈己见，试图从不同角度对书中涉及的上述命题给予某种回答或思索。
    美国是否衰落是辩论的焦点。“向第一吻别，乡亲们！”“美利坚，欧洲上来啦！”“超级大富日本以重要超级大国姿态崛起！”——触目惊心的标题出现在几家权威性报刊上。在衰落论者看来，二次大战后美国国际地位已明显下降。主要论据是：在经济上，美国已从战后初期占世界国民生产总值的５０％下降到目前的２５％；美国由世界最大债权国变为最大债务国，外贸、财政赤字严重；日本、西欧将与美国并驾齐驱。在军事上，苏联已与美国平分秋色；地区性强国的兴起对美国国家安全的威胁愈益增大。在科技上，美国战后的垄断地位已经动摇，日本、西欧在一些尖端技术领域已赶上甚至超过美国。在国际关系格局中，“目前全球最突出的变化是超级大国的衰落”（基辛格语）；美苏“两极对立”向多极化发展，等等。
    与上述观点针锋相对的人则认为，美国没有衰落，仍将发挥世界性领导作用。在他们的眼中，美国的净债额在国民生产总值中所占比例甚微，财政赤字所占比例亦少于日本；美国科技在总体上仍居世界前列；军事上最近几年已恢复实力。《华尔街日报》认为，战后初期是“历史异常时期”，美国当时在世界国民生产总值中所占比例偏高是可以理解的，而６０年代至今，这一比例一直保持在２５％左右，到２０１０年将升至３０％，同现在一样仍为日本的２倍。当前美国在世界经济中起着举足轻重的作用，美国若以减少进口来大幅削减外贸赤字，将使日本、西德等发展速度放慢，并进而触发世界性经济衰退。该报还从人口、国民生产总值及其１９６６年至１９８７年平均年增长率、通货膨胀率、劳动力、贸易额、能源、农业、军事、生活水平等方面，综合对比了各方的实力，其结论是，从９０年代直至下个世纪，美国仍具有“全球领导能力”，所需要的只是“决心”。
    这场辩论还在深入，自不必对各种观点一一褒贬臧否。它给人以深刻印象的是美国知识界浓厚的忧患意识及辩论对决策层的影响。
    过去，针对美国社会的各种弊端，《丑陋的美国人》、《日本名列第一》等著作不断提出警告。而这次的辩论则犹如“盛世危言”，为美国的未来鸣起了警钟。《强国的兴衰》出版后，各重要报刊均立即予以评介。平心而论，美国目前并无“迫在眉睫的危机”，然而，二次大战结束迄今，各国实力对比已发生变化，国际关系格局也随之演变；美国应如何重新认识自我？应采取何种对策保持其国际地位？是居安思危，防患未然，还是固步自封，坐待“沉舟侧畔千帆过”？这正是这场辩论的大背景和出发点。就辩论带来的深层思索而言，知识界的近虑远忧绝非危言耸听，许多专家认为，美国应审视往昔，认识环境，调整对策，面向未来。
    在辩论中，学术界、思想界纷纷著书立说，为决策层出谋划策。华盛顿国际战略问题研究所、布鲁金斯研究所等“智囊团”提出的一些重要主张有：美国应积极推进对苏缓和政策，争取持久的世界和平环境，为发展经济创造条件；国家安全战略应从注重军事竞争转向经济竞争；重视世界经济重心从欧洲转向亚太地区的趋势，外交应做相应的调整；鼓励工业投资，加强高技术开发；收缩海外军事力量，与盟国分担防务重负；从学前儿童开始，改善教育质量，提高国民素质，等等。
    美国政界高度重视这场辩论。布什总统宣誓就职后，一再强调其政府的着眼点在于“下一代的光明前途”，要当“教育总统”，并号召美国人民力戒贪图物质享受的奢靡之风，发扬勤奋劳作、艰苦创业的传统……
    下个世纪美国究竟会变成什么样子，恐怕谁也掐不准。问题在于置身一个“世界巨变的时代”（布什语），应怎样严肃对待国家的前途和民族的命运。目前国力强大的美国有如此强烈的忧患意识，倒是值得赞许的。
