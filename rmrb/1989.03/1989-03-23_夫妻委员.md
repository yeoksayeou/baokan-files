Husband and Wife Delegates

Xu Guangxian and Gao Xiaoxia, a husband and wife duo, are both members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Both are professors in the Department of Chemistry at Peking University and are assigned to the same small group. Whenever the CPPCC holds a meeting, the couple moves their "home." This time, they moved their "home" to the Xiangshan Hotel. The couple seems to have little interest in the evening's television recordings. Instead, they either discuss Li Peng's government work report or prepare for their group meeting speeches. Xu Guangxian said, "Our views on education are basically the same."

　　夫妻委员
    徐光宪和高小霞夫妻双双是政协委员，两人都是北大化学系的教授，编在一个小组。每逢政协开会，老两口就搬一次“家”。这回他们把“家”搬到香山饭店。夫妇俩对每晚的电视录相似乎不大感兴趣，有时间或议论李鹏总理的政府工作报告，或准备小组会上的发言。徐光宪说：“我们两对教育方面的看法基本一致。”
