	Israeli Foreign Minister Again Refuses to Negotiate with the PLO, Proposes "Three-Legged" Plan for the Middle East Issue

	Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 16th — (Reporter Lei Lili) Israeli Foreign Minister Arens, currently visiting the United States, once again refused to negotiate with the PLO and refused to acknowledge the PLO as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.

	Arens made these remarks in New York after concluding a three-day visit to Washington. He said that during his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Baker, he explicitly pointed out that contact with the PLO is "meaningless for the peace process in the Middle East."

	Arens said that the peace process in the Middle East is a "difficult, painful, and slow process," and therefore a "three-legged" approach is needed.

	Arens said that first, the United States and Egypt should persuade King Hussein of Jordan to participate in the negotiations to resolve the Palestinian issue. Second, Israel should negotiate with the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Third, Israel should negotiate with Arab countries.

	Arens categorizes Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as "Jordanian citizens" and refers to Palestinians living in Israel as "Israeli Arabs."

	Arens also denied reports that he and Baker had differing views on the Middle East peace process during their talks.

　　以外长再次拒绝同巴解谈判  提出中东问题“三条腿”方案
    新华社纽约３月１６日电  （记者雷力利）正在美国访问的以色列外长阿伦斯今天对美国犹太人组织发表讲话时再次拒绝与巴解进行谈判，拒绝承认巴解是巴勒斯坦人民的合法代表。
    阿伦斯是在结束华盛顿的三天访问后抵达纽约的。他说，在与美国国务卿贝克的会谈中，他明确指出与巴解接触对中东地区的和平进程“毫无建设意义”。
    阿伦斯说，中东的和平进程是非常“艰难、痛苦和缓慢的进程”，因此要采取“三条腿”走路的方法。
    阿伦斯说，首先，美国和埃及应说服约旦国王侯赛因参加解决巴勒斯坦问题的谈判。第二，以色列与约旦河西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人谈判。第三，以色列与阿拉伯国家进行谈判。
    阿伦斯把住在约旦河西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人划为“约旦公民”，而把生活在以色列的巴勒斯坦人称作“以色列阿拉伯人”。
    阿伦斯今天还否认他同贝克的会谈中就中东和平进程各执己见的报道。
