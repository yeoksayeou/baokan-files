Loyal and Exemplary — In Deep Mourning for Comrade Zhu Liangcai

Our respected mentor and friend, Comrade Zhu Liangcai, has completed his glorious life and left us. We are deeply saddened by his passing. Everyone must die. For some, their bodies may perish, but their spirits live on. Comrade Zhu Liangcai is such a person. Whenever we think of him, his immortal spirit inspires reverence and a great force that motivates us to live, study, and work like him.

Comrade Zhu Liangcai joined the revolution in 1925 and was one of the old fighters who followed Chairman Mao, Commander Zhu, and Commander Chen in the struggle on Jinggangshan. He devoted his entire life to the cause of liberating the Chinese people and defending the socialist construction of our motherland. Throughout his long years, whether in the enemy's court, on the battlefield of blood and fire, in the struggle against erroneous lines, or in the construction of the army after the revolution's victory, history has proven that he was a seasoned proletarian revolutionary, a loyal communist warrior, and an outstanding political leader and military commander in our army. He was highly respected, exceptionally talented, and an invaluable leader.

We first met Comrade Zhu Liangcai in the Jin-Cha-Ji base area during the anti-Japanese war. One of the most striking impressions he left on us was his unwavering loyalty to the Party. He always thought and acted in the interests of the Party, urgently addressing its concerns, and placing the Party's and people's interests above all else. His personal interests were always subordinate to those of the Party and the people. Because of this, he had great authority and strong appeal and cohesion, able to unite and lead the masses to accomplish their tasks well.

During the war years, he was wounded three times. On two occasions, he left the hospital before his wounds had healed, and his long-term selfless work had left him with a weakened body due to overwork. During his tenure as the Political Commissar of the Beijing Military Region, he often suffered from headaches. When the pain became unbearable, he would take two painkillers. At that time, shortly after the founding of the nation, the army was very busy with construction, and he wanted to do more work. However, due to his illness, he could not work full days. This troubled him greatly. He said, "I am the principal leader, but because of my illness, I cannot do much work, which affects the work of the military region. What should I do? Let younger and more energetic comrades take over, and I will rest and recover. When I am better, I will return to work." At that time, he was only 58 years old and could have worked while resting and recovering. However, he considered the bigger picture and requested to be relieved of his duties to rest and recover. The Central Military Commission leaders approved his request and praised him for his open-mindedness, consideration for the greater good, and dedication to the Party, calling on everyone to learn from him.

Even though Comrade Zhu Liangcai had stepped down from his position, his heart never left the Party's cause. He placed great importance on studying Marxism-Leninism and the works of Chairman Mao, as well as Party documents. After the publication of "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," he studied it very seriously. He read books and documents word by word, carefully pondering their meanings, and marking important points with lines and circles. He would even make marginal notes. When he was tired or had a headache, he would put down the book and rest for a while before continuing. Later, as his eyesight deteriorated, he used a magnifying glass to read. When he could no longer see even with the magnifying glass, he had others read to him or listened to broadcasts with earphones. The medical staff said, "Comrade Zhu is indeed tenacious." Every time we visited him, he would talk endlessly about the spirit of the Central Committee's documents. Once, he showed Comrade Fu Chongbi the marked "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" and said that these views should be more widely publicized. He also spoke to the comrades who came to visit him about the situation, saying that although the country still faced some difficulties, the reform and opening-up were going well. Our Party and country have hope. My mood is very pleasant, unlike during the "Cultural Revolution" when I was worried all the time.

Comrade Zhu Liangcai firmly supported and implemented the Party's correct lines, principles, and policies, and had a strong sense of discipline. During the Long March, he resolutely opposed Zhang Guotao's erroneous line, standing out clearly, fearless of being attacked. During the Anti-Japanese War, in the regions and units under his leadership, he boldly used intellectuals, uniting and educating them, enabling these comrades to achieve excellent results in the fields of culture, propaganda, theory, and education. Some became leading figures in these fields. He often said that after entering the city, we must still practice thrift and oppose waste. When subordinates submitted reports requesting him to approve funds, he would always have his secretary check the financial regulations or ask the financial director if it complied with the regulations and if he had the authority to approve it. Even if he had the authority, he would still check if there was money available. He said, "It seems like it's just a matter of approving a few dollars, but the state's finances are still difficult. This is a matter of policy and discipline, and it cannot be taken lightly or dealt with casually."

Comrade Zhu Liangcai highly valued the Party's fine traditions and was a firm defender and model executor of them. He said, "Frugality can help maintain integrity, and frugality can cultivate virtue." The sofa covers in his reception room were patched and reused until they were very worn out before he allowed the management department to replace them with new ones. He regulated that his family members and children could not ride in his car casually. He told his secretary that only items issued within the system could be accepted, and nothing could be casually requested from the management department. Someone said his secretary was too mechanical, but the secretary said, "The Political Commissar requires this, and there will be criticism if it is violated."

Comrade Zhu Liangcai dedicated his life to the political work of our army from the time he went to Jinggangshan. He had rich experience in political work and made outstanding contributions to it. During the Anti-Japanese War, Jin-Cha-Ji was known as the "Model Anti-Japanese Base Area," and as Comrade Nie Rongzhen's assistant in military political work, he made significant contributions. He actively organized model party branches and campaigns to kill the enemy and establish merit, and personally trained cadres to share party branch work experience, enhancing the fighting role of party branches and strengthening the army's combat effectiveness. He paid great attention to commendations, timely discovering and publicizing typical examples such as the "Five Heroes of Wolf Mountain," "People's Militia Hero Li Yong," and "The Mother of the Troops, Rong Guanxiu," greatly inspiring the enthusiasm of the broad masses of soldiers and civilians to unite and resist Japan.

Comrade Zhu Liangcai cared for and protected cadres, was fair and upright, and had good democratic practices. He never divided cadres into "this faction" or "that faction," but treated them as "people from all directions," equally and based on merit. He never spoke ill of cadres behind their backs but raised any issues face-to-face. During past political movements, he protected many comrades.

Comrade Zhu Liangcai's life was like a blazing torch, burning brightly and splendidly. Let us, like Comrade Zhu Liangcai, dedicate our lives to the motherland and the people!

　　忠心耿耿　堪称楷模        
    ——沉痛悼念朱良才同志
    我们尊敬的良师益友朱良才同志，走完了他光荣的一生离去了。对他的逝世，我们深感悲痛。人总是要死的。有的人躯体死了，精神还活着。朱良才同志就是这样的人。一想到他，他那不朽的精神，就使人肃然起敬，就有一股巨大的力量，鼓舞着我们要像他那样对待生活、学习、工作。
    朱良才同志１９２５年参加革命，是跟随毛主席、朱总司令、陈老总坚持井冈山斗争的老战士。他为中国人民的解放事业，为保卫祖国社会主义建设，忠心耿耿地战斗了一生。在漫长的岁月里，朱良才同志无论在敌人的法庭上，在血与火的战场上，还是在同错误路线作斗争中，在革命胜利后军队建设中，历史证明，他是一位久经考验的无产阶级革命家，忠诚的共产主义战士，我军优秀的政治工作领导者和军事指挥员。他德高望重，才能出众，是一位不可多得的领导人。
    我们是在抗日烽火燃烧的晋察冀根据地认识朱良才同志的，他给我们突出的印象之一，就是对党赤胆忠心，总是想党之所想，急党之所急，把党和人民的利益看得高于一切，个人利益自觉服从党和人民的利益。正因为如此，他有很高的威信，有很强的号召力、凝聚力，能够团结、领导群众去很好地完成任务。
    在战争年代，他曾三次负伤，有两次伤未愈就出院了，加上长期奋不顾身地工作，因之积劳成疾身体虚弱。他在担任北京军区政治委员期间，常常头痛。痛得厉害了，吞两片止痛药。那时建国不久，军队建设十分繁忙，他一心想多做工作，但却因病不能坚持全天工作。他为此而苦恼，他说：我是正职，因病不能多抓工作，对军区工作有影响。怎么办呢？让年富力强的同志来干吧，我休息治病，病好了，再工作。当时，他只有５８岁，本可以一边治病休息，一边工作。但他却从大局出发，向中央军委领导同志请求免职休息医病。中央和军委领导同志批准了他的请求，并赞扬他思想开明，顾全大局，一心为党，号召大家向他学习。
    朱良才同志虽然人从工作岗位上退下来了，但他的心一刻也没有离开党的事业。他非常重视学习马列和毛主席著作，学习党的文件。《邓小平文选》发行后，他学习很认真。他读书、看文件逐字逐句，细心体会，重要之处还要划上杠杠、圈圈，有的地方还作眉批、旁批。读累了，头痛了，折上书，过一会儿，再读。后来，他的眼力不行了，就拿着放大镜看；拿着放大镜也看不见了，就让别人读给他听，戴上耳机听广播。医护人员说：朱老实在顽强。我们每次去看他，他总是滔滔不绝地谈中央文件精神，有一次还把划了红杠杠的《邓小平文选》拿给傅崇碧同志看，说应该多宣传这些观点。他还对来看他的同志讲形势，说国家虽然还面临一些困难，但改革、开放的形势很好。我们党和国家是有希望的。我的心情很舒畅，不像“文革”那时忧心忡忡。
    朱良才同志坚决拥护和贯彻党的正确路线、方针、政策，纪律观念很强。在长征途中，他反对张国焘的错误路线旗帜鲜明，虽遭打击，但无所畏惧。抗日战争时期，在他领导的地区、单位，他大胆使用知识分子，团结教育他们，使这些同志在文化、宣传、理论、教育等领域做出很好的成绩，有些人成为这些事业的领导骨干。他经常说，进城后，我们还要厉行节约，反对浪费。下面送来请他批发经费的报告，凡是他拿不准的，总要秘书查查财务法规，或问问财务部长，看看符合不符合规定，他有没有权力批，有权力批也要看有没有钱。他说：看来是批几个钱的问题，国家财政还困难，这是个政策、纪律问题，不可以掉以轻心随便对待。
    朱良才同志十分珍惜党的优良传统，是党的优良传统的坚定维护者和模范执行者。他说：俭可以助廉，俭可以养德。他家会客室的沙发套破了补补再用，实在破旧得很啦，他才允许管理部门换新的。他的汽车，他规定家属、小孩不能随便乘坐。他告诉秘书，凡是制度内发给他的东西才能要，不能随便向管理部门要东西。有人说他的秘书太机械了，这位秘书说：政委是这样要求的，违背了要受批评的。
    朱良才同志从上井冈山起，就把毕生精力献给了我军的政治工作。他有丰富的政治工作经验，对我军的政治工作有卓越的建树。抗日战争时期，晋察冀被誉为“模范抗日根据地”，他作为聂荣臻同志在军队政治工作方面的一个助手，是有贡献的。他积极组织开展模范党支部和杀敌立功运动，并亲自集训骨干向他们传授党支部工作经验，提高了党支部的战斗堡垒作用，增强了部队战斗力。他很重视表彰先进，及时发现和宣传了“狼牙山五壮士”、“民兵英雄李勇”、“子弟兵的母亲戎冠秀”等典型，极大地鼓舞了广大军民团结抗日的热情。
    朱良才同志关心爱护干部，公道正派，有良好的民主作风。他从来不把干部分成这个“山头”的、那个“山头”的，而是“五湖四海”，一视同仁，任人唯贤。他在背后从来不说干部的坏话，有什么意见当面提出。在过去的政治运动中，他保护了不少同志。
    朱良才同志的一生有如一支熊熊的火炬，燃烧得十分光明灿烂。让我们像朱良才同志那样，把自己的一生贡献给祖国和人民吧！
