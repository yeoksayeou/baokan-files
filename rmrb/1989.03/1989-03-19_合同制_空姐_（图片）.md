Contract-Based Flight Attendants

The flight attendants on Southwest Airlines' 4401/2 route, which regularly flies from Chengdu to "the Roof of the World" – Lhasa, are mostly contract-based workers who started their careers in civil aviation in 1985. Under the leadership of cabin manager Chen Juanjuan (third from the right), they have carried out high-quality service activities, earning high praise from both Chinese and foreign passengers.

    合同制“空姐”
    常年由成都飞往“世界屋脊”——拉萨的西南航空公司4401／2航班的“空中小姐”，大多数是1985年走上民航岗位的合同制工人。她们在乘务长陈娟娟（右三）的带领下开展优质服务活动，博得了中外旅客的高度赞扬。
