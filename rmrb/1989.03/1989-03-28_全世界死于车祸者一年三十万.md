In recent years, the number of people dying in traffic accidents has been alarmingly high.

According to a survey by a Swiss insurance company, 300,000 people die in car accidents worldwide each year.

In the United States and Europe, the fatality rate due to car accidents is 50 per million. From 1973 to 1983, work-related accidents and car accidents were the leading causes of death worldwide, surpassing cancer, heart disease, and infectious diseases.

Starting from 1985, with the implementation of traffic safety education, improvement of road conditions, speed limits, and the regular use of seat belts, the number of traffic accidents has significantly decreased. In Europe, the accident rate per 10,000 vehicles dropped from 190 in 1970 to 94 in 1985. During the same period, Japan saw a reduction from 403 to 120.

In 1985, the countries with the fewest traffic accidents were Australia, Switzerland, Norway, and Denmark. That same year, Iceland, South Africa, Austria, and Belgium recorded the highest number of accidents.

　　全世界死于车祸者一年三十万
    近年来，因交通事故死亡人数多得惊人。
    据瑞士一家保险公司的调查，世界上每年有３０万人死于汽车交通事故。
    在美国和欧洲，车祸造成的死亡率为百万分之五十。１９７３年至１９８３年工伤事故和汽车交通事故是世界上造成死亡最主要的原因，超过了癌症、心脏病和传染病。
    从１９８５年起，由于开展交通安全教育、改善道路状况、限制车速及经常使用安全带等措施，交通事故的数字明显下降。在欧洲，每万辆汽车的事故率已从１９７０年的１９０辆下降到１９８５年的９４辆，同期在日本从４０３辆减至１２０辆。
    １９８５年交通事故较少的国家是澳大利亚、瑞士、挪威和丹麦，同年冰岛、南非、奥地利和比利时的车祸则创造了“纪录”。
