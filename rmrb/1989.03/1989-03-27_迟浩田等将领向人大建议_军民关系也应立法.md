Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 26th. Reporter Gao Xin Qing reports: Senior leaders attending the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, including General Der Hao Tien, the Chief of the General Staff, and three Major Generals Zhang Zhi Jian, Cai Ren Shan, and Kong Xian Li, have proposed that legislation should be established for military-civilian relations.

The generals pointed out that unity between the military and civilians is one of the three fundamental principles of our army. In the new era of developing a commodity economy, while the fundamental interests of the military and civilians are aligned, some conflicts and disputes have arisen, such as disputes over real estate, the encroachment of military barracks and training grounds, compensation for training-related incidents, and the placement of demobilized military officers, among others.

How to resolve these conflicts and disputes? The generals told the reporter that the traditional method is for the military and local authorities to negotiate, showing mutual understanding and accommodation, relying on emotions and morality. This method is still largely in use, but it is no longer effective because it is too arbitrary. "The fundamental solution is to legislate military-civilian relations, providing both the military and local authorities with a common legal basis to follow and be constrained by."

General Der Hao Tien told the reporter, "Not only should military-civilian relations be legislated, but national defense projects and military marriages should also have protective laws."

　　迟浩田等将领向人大建议        
    军民关系也应立法
    本报北京３月２６日讯  记者高新庆报道：出席七届人大二次会议的总参谋长、上将迟浩田和三位少将张志坚、蔡仁山、孔宪礼建议：军民关系也应立法。
    将军们指出，军民一致是我军三大原则之一。在新时期发展商品经济的大环境中，在根本利益一致的前提下，军民之间也产生一些利益冲突和矛盾，如房地产纠纷，部队营房、靶场被挤占，训练中的赔偿，部队转业干部的安置，等等。
    如何解决这些矛盾、冲突？将军们告诉记者，传统的办法是军地协商，互谅互让，靠感情、道德，现在基本还沿用这个办法，不过不大灵了，因为带有很大的随意性。“根本的解决办法是对军民关系立法，使军地双方都有共同遵循、约束的法律依据”。
    迟总长对记者说，不仅军民关系要立法，国防工程、军婚都应该搞一个保护法。
