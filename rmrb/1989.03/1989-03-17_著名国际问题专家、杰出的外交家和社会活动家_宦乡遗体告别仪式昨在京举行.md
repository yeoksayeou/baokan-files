Comrade Xun Xiang was born in Zunyi, Guizhou, on November 2, 1909. In his youth, he was filled with patriotism and democratic ideals. In 1938, driven by his passion for resisting Japanese aggression and saving the nation, he took on the role of editor-in-chief of the *Frontline Daily* for the Third War Zone of the Nationalist Government. During this period, he gradually accepted the influence of the Communist Party of China's ideology. After the New Fourth Army Incident, he used his position to rescue Comrade Feng Xuefeng and others from the concentration camp in Shangrao. In May 1948, he joined the Communist Party of China. After the founding of New China, he served as the director of the European and African Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1954, he was transferred to serve as China's first envoy to the United Kingdom. After returning to the country in 1962, he served as the deputy minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the director of the Policy Research Office. During the Cultural Revolution, he was persecuted. In 1976, he resumed work and served as the ambassador to the European Economic Community, Belgium, and Luxembourg. In 1978, he served as the vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Since 1982, he has served as the general secretary of the State Council's International Affairs Research Center (renamed the China International Affairs Research Center in 1988).

Comrade Xun Xiang also served as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress, chairman of the China Pacific Economic Cooperation National Committee, chairman of the China Peaceful Unification Promotion Association, chairman of the National Taiwan Research Association, chairman of the China International Law Society, and honorary president of the *World Economic Herald*. Additionally, he was a member of the United Nations Development Planning Commission, an executive member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, a member of the Standing Committee of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference, an academician of the Royal Scientific Academy of Morocco, an honorary researcher of the London Economic Research Institute, and an honorary doctor of laws from the University of Glasgow in the United Kingdom.

Comrade Xun Xiang devoted himself to the study of world economics and international politics for a long time, achieving profound insights. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, his research work and academic activities entered a new stage, making important contributions to the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy. Over the past decade, he published a large number of research reports and academic papers with unique insights.

His outstanding academic achievements made him one of the most renowned international affairs experts in contemporary China, and he also enjoyed high prestige internationally.

Comrade Xun Xiang was loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and loyal to Marxism. Even when he was ill, he remained deeply concerned about international situations and national affairs, repeatedly offering analyses and policy suggestions. Comrade Xun Xiang always cared about the great cause of national reunification, doing a lot of work in his lifetime, and even during his illness, he was still thinking about how to contribute to the realization of the unification of the people across the Taiwan Strait.

During his treatment in Shanghai, Comrades Zhao Ziyang, Wan Li, and Hu Qili had sent people to visit him multiple times.
