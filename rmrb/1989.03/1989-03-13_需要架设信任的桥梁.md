The three-day opening ceremony of the European conventional arms talks and the talks on building confidence and security measures in Europe in Vienna has concluded successfully. Now, the negotiations have entered the substantive stage. Compared to the "Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions in Central Europe" talks, which have been ongoing for 15 years without results, this meeting has two notable features. First, the atmosphere of the meeting is relatively good. In the Hofburg Palace, instead of the usual scenes of mutual accusations and attacks seen in past arms talks, there was a calm and rational atmosphere of discussion and consultation. Representatives from various countries jointly explored new paths for European disarmament. Second, the breadth of participating countries in the history of European disarmament is unprecedented. All 23 member countries of NATO and the Warsaw Pact are participating in the negotiations, and 35 member countries of the CSCE (including many neutral and non-aligned countries) are also present to discuss the establishment of confidence and security measures. The broad participation of European countries shows the high level of concern and importance that each country attaches to European disarmament.

At this meeting, the Warsaw Pact and NATO each presented their own disarmament proposals. Of course, there are still significant differences between the two proposals, but there are also some basic common points. For example, both sides agree on eliminating the existing imbalance in conventional arms, significantly reducing troops and conventional weapons, and transforming the organizational structure of conventional arms into a defensive nature. Originally, people did not expect that a single meeting could solve the long-standing disarmament issues, nor did they expect that the two sides could easily cross the path of negotiations filled with traps, quagmires, and thorns. However, both sides presented relatively practical disarmament proposals at this meeting, showing a spirit of seeking common ground and a reconciliatory atmosphere. People saw new hope from this, strengthening their confidence in disarmament. As some Western observers pointed out, this reconciliatory atmosphere is more important than reaching a specific agreement, because with this atmosphere, arms talks may be able to end the long-standing stalemate of "deaf dialogue" and get out of the dead end. British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe said that there is indeed a sense of "hope," and many participants also believe that this meeting may become a good starting point for overcoming European divisions and building trust and understanding.

The success of this round of negotiations is closely related to the current trend of easing East-West relations. It reflects that the European people no longer want their countries to become the arena for superpower arms races, nor do they want their territories to become powder kegs for two military blocs. At the same time, whether in Eastern Europe or Western Europe, all countries feel the pressure of economic competition. Spending huge sums on arms is against the trend, and using manpower and financial resources for economic development and strengthening national power is a wise choice. The strong desire of the European people for peace and disarmament is a huge driving force for the two superpowers to seriously sit down at the negotiating table.

Based on historical experience, the author believes that the key to the success of future disarmament talks lies in establishing mutual understanding and trust. Over 40 years of the Cold War and confrontation have erected a wall of opposition and suspicion between East and West Europe. In arms control talks, this manifests as deep mistrust, constant defenses, and unwillingness to compromise. Looking back at the "Central European Disarmament Talks" that began in 1977, over 15 years and 45 rounds of talks, each time starting with challenges and ending with arguments. After more than a decade, the number of arms has not been reduced but has instead been in a spiral of increase, which cannot be described as anything other than a tragedy for Europe and a page worth reflecting on in the history of disarmament.

Of course, we should also clearly see that truly establishing trust and understanding will be a long and tortuous process. The iceberg will not melt overnight. Moreover, the United States and the Soviet Union have not yet given up their competition over Europe, and in the negotiations, they remain important constraints. Therefore, European disarmament still requires the continued efforts of the peoples and governments of European countries. However, we should also optimistically see that since the wind of détente has already blown into the negotiating hall in Vienna, people have reason to expect the arrival of the spring thaw in Europe.

　　需要架设信任的桥梁
    郑园园
    历时３天的欧洲常规军备谈判和欧洲建立信任和安全措施谈判开幕式在维也纳已圆满结束，现在，谈判进入实质性阶段。同延续了１５年而毫无结果的“中欧共同均衡裁军谈判”相比，这次会议有两个显著的特点，一是会议气氛较好。在霍夫堡宫里，人们看到的不是以往裁军谈判常有的那种互相指责、互相攻讦的场面，而是一种心平气和磋商和讨论的景象，各国代表共同探索解决欧洲裁军的新路子。二是与会国的广泛性在欧洲裁军史上也是未曾有过的。北约和华约２３个成员国全部参加谈判，３５个欧安会成员国（其中不少是中立和不结盟国家）也同时与会参加建立信任和安全措施的讨论。欧洲国家的广泛参与，表明各国对欧洲裁军的高度关注和重视。
    这次会议上，华约和北约分别提出了自己的裁军方案，当然，这两个方案还存在不小的分歧，但也有一些基本的共同点，如在消除现有常规军备的不平衡状况、大幅度裁减军队及常规武器，以及在将常规军备的组织结构改为防御性质方面，双方都取得一致意见。本来，人们并不期望通过一次会议就解决积累多年的裁军难题，也并不指望双方能轻轻松松地跨过那条充满圈套、泥淖和荆棘的谈判之路。但是，这次会议上双方都提出了比较切实的裁军方案，表现出一种求同精神与和解的气氛，人们从中看到了新的希望，增强了裁军的信心。正如西方一些观察家指出的，这种和解气氛比达成某一项具体协议更为重要，因为有了这种气氛，军备谈判有可能结束长期的“聋子对话”僵局，走出死胡同。英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪表示，现在确实有一种“希望之感”，许多与会代表也认为，这次会议可能会成为克服欧洲分裂、建立信任和理解的良好开端。
    此次谈判能获得这样的开端，是同当前东西方关系趋向缓和的大背景分不开的。反映了欧洲人民再也不愿自己的国家成为超级大国扩军角逐的场所，再也不想把自己的领土变成两个军事集团的火药库。同时，无论在东欧还是西欧，所有国家无一例外地感到经济竞争的压力，耗费巨资搞军备有悖于潮流，把人力财力用于发展经济，增强实力才是明智的选择。欧洲人民争取和平与裁军的强烈愿望是促使两个超级大国认真坐到谈判桌前的巨大推动力。
    根据历史的经验，笔者认为，今后裁军谈判成功与否的关键在于要建立相互的理解和信任。４０多年的冷战和对峙，在东西欧之间耸立起了一座对立和猜疑的冰山，表现在军控谈判中，就是疑心重重、处处设防互不相让。反观从１９７７年开始的“中欧裁军谈判”，１５年间举行了４５轮谈判，回回都以诘难开始，以争吵告终。十几年谈下来，军备数量不见削减，反而竞相攀比，使军备数量螺旋式地上升，不能不说这是欧洲的悲剧，是裁军史上值得反思的一页。
    当然，我们也应该清楚地看到，要真正建立信任和理解，要经历一个漫长而曲折的过程。冰山不会消融于一旦。而美苏两国尚未放弃对欧洲的争夺，在谈判中，它们仍然是重要的制约因素。因此，欧洲的裁军还有待欧洲各国人民和政府的不断努力。不过，我们仍然应该乐观地看到，缓和之风既然已经吹进维也纳的谈判大厅，人们有理由期待欧洲冰雪消融的春天的来临。
