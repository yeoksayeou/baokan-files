Start Afresh!
—To Jiang Zilong
Chen Guokai

Zilong,

This time you came to Shenzhen and we had a long talk over tea. I was most delighted by your words: “I will return to industrial themes!”

It is time to return to your “hometown”!

Over the years, I have been closely following your writing. I am pleased to see that despite your leadership role in the Tianjin Writers Association, you remain detached and have not stopped writing. You are working on novellas and novels. I, a lazy person by nature, can hardly understand where you find such boundless energy? It is a joy to see that you have not been tied down by mundane affairs!

I have read most of your works published in recent years. To the surprise of many readers, you have stepped out of the familiar industrial realm, and your pen has turned to other social strata. The art of writing has no boundaries; one writes what one feels, without being constrained. After reading your recent novel “Ziwei Liu De,” I was even amazed at how much medical knowledge you possess. You write about the lives of all walks of life with ease, and these works have already been commented on by critics. Critics' views are more insightful than mine, so there is no need for me to elaborate. I will just share one feeling: regardless of how your artistic techniques and subjects change, your style remains that of Jiang Zilong—bold and vigorous, unrestrained and expansive.

But overall, I feel that reading these novels is not as exciting as reading your industrial-themed works. This is just a feeling, and I cannot explain the reason. Perhaps it is because I have a preference for industrial-themed works. A critic said you are the son of a large enterprise, and I appreciate this statement. Large enterprises have forged your character and infused your soul. Although our artistic personalities are different, I prefer romance and humor, but I have always admired the grand style and the scenes of iron and fire in your works. I am just a small worker in a large enterprise, playing a minor role on the sidelines, but I am happy to see that the literary world has produced a group of sons of large enterprises.

Now, Chinese enterprises are in a state of excitement, anxiety, confusion, and bewilderment. Contemporary industrial-themed novels are obviously weak. People hope to hear the strong voices from the literary world, the sons of large enterprises, from the depths of their hearts, rather than cheap advertising literature. We have bid farewell to the era of literature serving politics and short-term gains, but literature is not just a small decoration in a highbrow study, nor is it just a sentimental and romantic dream of lovers, nor is it just a joke for self-entertainment or a small trick for others to enjoy. Of course, these all have their reasons for existence, but literature should resonate with a powerful voice on the chest of the times.

Zilong, I understand your intention to return to industrial themes. Your return is not a simple repetition of the past. Any literary phenomenon cannot be a simple repetition. Over the years, your emotions have not left the business world, and businesspeople also need writer friends. From our long talk, I know you are very concerned about the fate of Chinese enterprises. In the business world, you have so many friends, you understand and empathize with them, and you feel deeply about their joys and sorrows. In my opinion, large enterprises are your true creative territory. Every writer has his creative territory. Faulkner once said that he spent his life writing about a place the size of a postage stamp in his hometown. Return to your territory! There are countless difficulties and hardships, as well as beautiful and strange scenery and colorful characters. A large enterprise is a society. In a sense, it more concentratedly reflects the various contradictions in our society and condenses the soul of our nation. Your pen re-entering this familiar territory will stir up new waves of emotion, inspiring stronger creative inspiration. After a few years, having experienced the seven colors of life, your heart has accumulated more blocks, and with a drink and a long song, you will definitely have a new voice that touches the heart. I eagerly look forward to it.

Zilong, once you have made up your mind, keep moving forward, raise your wise sails, and with your bravery, start afresh!

I wish you success!

Wishing you a peaceful spring!

　　重新开始吧！
    ——致蒋子龙
    陈国凯
    子龙：
    这次你来深圳把盏长谈，我最高兴的是你说的那句话：“我会重返工业题材！”
    是应该重返“故乡”了！
    这些年来，我一直注视着你的创作。我高兴地看到，你尽管担任了天津作协的领导工作，还很超脱，没有放笔。你在写中篇、长篇。我这懒惰成性的人甚至难以理解你哪来这么旺盛的精力？你没有被繁杂的事务捆住手脚，可喜可贺！
    近年来你发表的作品我大体读了。出乎许多读者的意料，你走出了熟悉的工业领域，笔端转向别的社会阶层。文章之道本来没有什么疆界，有所感则有所言，无需作茧自缚。读完你最近的长篇《子午流德》，我甚至惊讶你怎么懂得那么多医学知识。三教九流的生活你涉笔成趣，这些作品已有评论家评说，评论家的见解比我高明，勿须我再赘言。只说一点感觉：不论你的艺术手法和描写对象如何变化，气质还是蒋子龙的——骠悍雄浑、恣肆汪洋。
    但从总体而言，读这些小说我觉得不如读你写的工业题材小说带劲，这只是感觉，说不清什么道理。也许是我对工业题材的作品有点偏爱吧。一位评论家说你是大企业的儿子，我很欣赏这句话。大企业锻造了你的品格，浇注了你的灵魂。尽管我们的艺术个性不同，我偏爱浪漫幽默，但我一直欣赏你作品中雄浑的气势和铁火交融的画面。我只是大企业的一名小工，在路边敲敲石子的角色，但我为中国文坛上出现了一批大企业的儿子而高兴。
    如今中国企业正处于兴奋激动焦躁困惑之中，当代工业题材小说明显疲软。人们希望听到文学界里大企业儿子们发自内心深处的强劲声音，而不是廉价的广告文学。我们已经告别了文学为政治服务的急功近利的年代，但文学毕竟不只是高雅书斋里的小摆设，更不只是缠绵哀艳的鸳鸯蝴蝶梦，也不只是插科打诨的自娱或供人玩赏的小把戏。当然这些都有其存在的理由，但是文学应该以更强有力的声音在时代的胸膛上搏动。
    子龙，我理解你重返工业题材的意思，你的重返绝不是过去的重复。任何文学现象都不可能是简单的重复。多年来，你的感情没有离开企业界，企业家们也急需作家朋友。一席长谈，我知道你十分关注中国企业的命运。在企业界你有那么多朋友，你熟悉和理解他们，对他们的悲欢际遇感受弥深。以愚见，大企业是你创作的真正领地。每个作家都有他的创作领地。福克纳有句名言，他一辈子就写他家乡那块邮票大的地方。重返你的领地吧！那儿有说不完说不清的艰难困苦，也有绮丽奇妙的风光和风流人物。一个大企业就是一个社会。从某种意义上说，它更集中地反映了我们社会的各种矛盾，浓缩了我们民族的灵魂。你的笔重新进入这熟悉的领地，会使你感情上掀起新的层波迭浪，激发更强烈的创作灵感。几年的时光流逝，悟透了七彩人生，胸中垒块渐多，把酒长歌，完全有扣人心弦的新声迸发。我热切地祈望着。
    子龙，下了决心就一直朝前走，鼓起你智慧的风帆，带着你一身豪气，重新开始吧！
    预祝你的成功！
    顺祝春安！
