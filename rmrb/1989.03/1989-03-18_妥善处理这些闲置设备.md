A Point of Hope

	Properly Handle These Idle Devices

	Currently, after the closure of some township enterprises, many idle devices remain. Due to poor management, some are rusted, some have been stolen, and some have been sold as scrap. In Jiuzhen Town of our city, the idle devices of village-level enterprises alone are valued at over ten million yuan. We hope that the relevant departments will promptly handle these idle devices to prevent the loss of public property.

　　妥善处理这些闲置设备
    目前，一些乡村企业关闭后，留下许多闲置设备。由于管理不善，有的受到锈蚀，有的被盗一空，有的被当做废品卖掉。我市九真镇村一级的企业闲置的设备价值达一千多万元。希望有关部门及时处理好这些闲置设备，使人民财产免遭损失。
