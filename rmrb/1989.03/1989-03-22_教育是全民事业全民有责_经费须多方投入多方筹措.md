Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 21st.

Education is a public undertaking, everyone is responsible. Funds must be sourced from multiple channels and mobilized from multiple parties.

Premier Li Peng's government work report pays special attention to education. He calls on all levels of government, departments, and industries to further enhance their understanding of education, highly value its long-term strategic importance, and ensure the development of the education sector during the period of rectification and austerity.

Premier Li Peng said that in 1989, the State Council decided not only to not reduce educational funds but also to significantly increase them. The government's educational funds will reach 3.74 billion yuan, an increase of 500 million yuan, a growth of 15.4%. In addition, urban and rural educational surcharges and other off-budget educational funds will also see a substantial increase. Premier Li Peng pointed out that, in the long term, solving the problem of insufficient educational funds cannot rely solely on increasing government financial allocations. It is necessary to reform the education system through reform, making education a public undertaking and a public responsibility, increasing the entire society's investment in education. While continuing to increase government financial allocations and clearly defining the proportion of educational funds that each level of government must bear, efforts should be made to reform the school management system, develop social forces to run schools, and open up new channels for raising educational funds. In recent years, some places have actively taken various measures to mobilize the enthusiasm of all sectors of society and the people to develop education, promoting the development of the education sector. As long as these new experiences are seriously summarized and continuously improved, it is entirely possible to gradually increase the proportion of educational funds in the gross national product.

The development of the education sector must start from China's actual situation. Premier Li Peng believes that due to significant differences in the economic and cultural foundations of various regions, while increasing the responsibilities of local governments, more decision-making power should be granted to local governments, enabling them to decide on major issues in education work based on local conditions.

Premier Li Peng has high hopes for the broad masses of teachers. He said that the development and reform of education must rely on and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of teachers, and strive to cultivate a high-quality teaching team. Teacher training work should be strengthened in a planned and step-by-step manner, expanding the sources and channels for cultivating teachers. Measures should continue to be taken to improve the working and living conditions of teachers. At the same time, in-depth reforms of the school internal management system should be carried out, optimizing the teaching team, and continuously improving the ideological and professional quality of the broad masses of teachers.

Li Peng also emphasized the importance of improving and strengthening ideological and political education, and seriously addressing issues such as school discipline and school culture. For the current chaotic phenomena in some schools, such as arbitrary fees, issuing diplomas indiscriminately, teachers and students engaging in business, and lax teaching discipline, as well as the problem of some students dropping out of school in some places, all levels of government and education departments must pay high attention, take effective measures to correct them, and strive to create a good environment for teaching and educating people.

### 教育是全民事业全民有责  经费须多方投入多方筹措

　　教育是全民事业全民有责        
    经费须多方投入多方筹措
    新华社北京３月２１日电  李鹏总理的政府工作报告，对教育给予特别的关注。他要求各级政府、各部门和各行各业进一步提高对教育的认识，高度重视教育的长期重要战略地位，在治理整顿期间努力保证教育事业的发展。
    李鹏总理说，１９８９年国务院决定对教育经费不仅不减少，而且有较大幅度的增加。政府的教育经费将达到３７４亿元，比去年增加５０亿元，增长１５．４％。此外，城乡教育费附加等预算外教育经费，也将有较多增加。李鹏总理指出，从长远看，解决教育经费不足的问题，只靠增加政府财政拨款是不够的。必须通过改革，使教育事业成为全民的事业、全民的责任，增加全社会对教育的投入。在继续增加政府财政拨款并明确各级政府财政所必须负担的教育经费比例的同时，要积极改革办学体制，发展社会力量办学，开辟筹措教育经费的新渠道。近些年，一些地方积极采取各种措施调动社会各方面和人民群众发展教育的积极性，促进了教育事业的发展。只要认真总结这些新鲜经验，不断加以完善，完全有可能逐步增加教育经费在国民生产总值中的比重。
    发展教育事业，要从我国的实际情况出发。李鹏总理认为，由于各地经济文化基础差异较大，要在加重地方政府责任的同时，赋予地方政府更大的统筹权和决策权，使他们能够根据当地的情况来决定教育工作的重大问题。
    李鹏总理对广大教师寄予厚望。他说，教育的发展和改革，必须坚决依靠和充分发挥广大教师的积极性和创造性，努力培养一支素质优良的教师队伍。要有计划、有步骤地加强教师培训工作，扩大教师的来源和培养途径。要继续采取措施，改善教师的工作条件和生活条件。同时，要深入进行学校内部管理体制的改革，优化教师队伍，不断提高广大教师的思想和业务素质。
    李鹏还要求把改进和加强思想品德和政治教育放到重要位置，并切实抓好校风、校纪建设。对当前少数学校中存在的乱收费、滥发文凭、师生经商、教学纪律松弛等某些混乱现象，以及一些地方出现的中小学生辍学、弃学问题，各级政府和教育部门必须高度重视，采取有力措施予以纠正，努力造就良好的教书育人环境。
