Title: China's "Agricultural to Non-Agricultural" Population Severely Out of Control

Over the past nine years, the total number of China's "agricultural to non-agricultural" population has exceeded 40 million, averaging 4.7 million per year. Currently, this trend shows no signs of abating, and the resulting conflicts are a cause for concern.

Data provided by relevant departments indicate that for every "agricultural to non-agricultural" person absorbed by the city, an annual grain and oil subsidy of 120 yuan is required. With 4.7 million people, the country would need to increase its expenditure by 560 million yuan annually. Adding the 40 million people who have been transferred over the past nine years, the annual expenditure would be 4.8 billion yuan. This enormous expenditure is undoubtedly a heavy burden on China's current economic situation. This does not include the fact that 40% of the "agricultural to non-agricultural" population each year needs to be placed in employment, and 40% have no housing, which further exacerbates the city's employment, housing, education, medical care, and transportation difficulties.

The root of the problem lies in the chaotic policies. Statistics show that of the 4.7 million "agricultural to non-agricultural" people each year, about 50% are due to local regulations. Relevant departments have called for a comprehensive cleanup and rectification, and currently, it is necessary to change the situation where five or six departments at the central level approve "agricultural to non-agricultural" work. It is suggested to establish an organization to coordinate "agricultural to non-agricultural" work, unify the formulation of relevant policies, and make "agricultural to non-agricultural" work adapt to urban construction. The state should also formulate policies to guide surplus rural labor, develop local sideline and industrial production, and ease urban pressure.

### 我国“农转非”人口严重失控

　　我国“农转非”人口严重失控
    ９年来，我国“农转非”人口总数已超过４０００万，平均每年４７０万人。目前，这种势头仍然有增无减，由此引发的诸多矛盾令人担忧。
    有关部门提供的测算数据表明，城镇每接收一名“农转非”人员，每年需要给予粮油补助１２０元，按４７０万人计算，一年国家就要增加支出５．６亿元，加上９年累计转移的４０００多万人，一年就要支出４８亿元。这笔巨额的支出对于我国目前的经济状况来说，无疑是一个沉重的负担。这还不包括在每年的“农转非”的人口中，有４０％的人需要安置就业，有４０％的人没有住房，这更加剧了城镇的就业、住房、入学、就医、交通等方面的困难。
    政出多门是“农转非”人口失控症结所在。据统计，在每年４７０万“农转非”人口中，有５０％左右是由地方自行规定政策造成的。有关部门呼吁对此做一次全面的清理和整顿，当前要改变中央一级五六个部门审批“农转非”工作的状况，建议建立一个组织协调“农转非”工作的机构，统一制定有关政策，使“农转非”的工作与城镇建设相适应。国家还应制定政策，引导农村剩余劳力，发展当地工副业生产，以缓解城市压力。
