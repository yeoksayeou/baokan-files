After Voting, Gorbachev Talks to Reporters
Gorbachev Jokes About Opposition Votes

Soviet leader Gorbachev said, "Now, there are people interfering with the reforms from both the 'left' and the 'right,' even trying to make the reform ship unsteady. This is not acceptable. I believe in the people, and we will definitely hold firm!"

Gorbachev went to a polling station on Lenin Hills this noon to vote for people's representatives amid light drizzle. After voting, he answered questions from reporters.

When asked how he viewed the 12 opposition votes against him, Gorbachev smiled and said, "Not many. If there were no opposition votes, I would be disappointed, because I feel that not everything is going as smoothly as we had hoped." He then asked the reporter, "Are you also afraid of sharp criticism?"

Gorbachev emphasized that the Soviet people are the main actors in determining the course of the revolution. Only when the working people take action in every place can the reform succeed.

When a Western reporter asked if there was a contradiction between the diversity of opinions, promoting democracy, and the criticism of Yeltsin during the election, Gorbachev said, "In the election, not only Yeltsin was criticized, but the people also evaluated what we did in the past, present, and during the reform period. This is good. Now, the activities of the ruling leaders and the heads of state organs have all received various evaluations. Why should some of us be exempt from criticism and supervision?"

　　投票之后答记者        
    戈氏笑谈反对票
    新华社莫斯科３月２６日电  （记者唐修哲）苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫说：“现在有人从‘左’的和‘右’的方面来干扰改革，甚至想使改革的大船摇晃不定，这是不行的。我相信人民，我们一定能坚持住！”
    戈尔巴乔夫今天中午冒着蒙蒙细雨来到列宁山上的一个选区投票选举人民代表。投票后回答了记者的问题。
    当有记者问他如何看待１２张反对他的选票时，戈尔巴乔夫微笑着说：“不多。如果没有一张反对票那倒会使我失望，因为我感觉到，不是一切都进行得像我们所期望的那样圆满”。他还反问记者：“难道尖锐的批评把你们也吓住了吗？”
    戈尔巴乔夫强调苏联人民才是决定改革命运的主要角色。只有劳动人民在各个地方都行动起来，改革才能成功。
    当一名西方记者问到意见多元化、发扬民主同竞选过程中批评叶利钦之间是否有矛盾时，戈尔巴乔夫说：“在选举中不仅叶利钦受到了批评，对过去、现在、以及改革年代我们干的事，选民都作了评价，这很好。现在执政的领导人及国家机关的负责人的活动都得到了各种评价，为何我们中间要有人置身于批评之外、可以不受监督呢？”
