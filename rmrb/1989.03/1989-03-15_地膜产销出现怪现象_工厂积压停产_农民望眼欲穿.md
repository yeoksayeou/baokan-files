Letter to the Editor:

The spring planting season has begun, and many provinces and cities are facing a severe shortage of agricultural plastic film, a crucial need for rural areas. This issue urgently needs to be addressed.

This year, due to the state's increase in cotton procurement prices, farmers' enthusiasm for cotton cultivation has surged. Many places are planning to expand their cotton fields, but they are struggling to obtain agricultural plastic film. Shandong Province's Huimin region is a key cotton-producing area in China. This year, the region has allocated over 3 million mu (approximately 200,000 hectares) for cotton cultivation, an increase of over 400,000 mu compared to last year, requiring more than 5,000 tons of plastic film. The provincial agricultural materials company planned to supply 1,050 tons, but farmers have only managed to purchase 400 tons. If the necessary plastic film is not procured soon, the cotton harvest may be in jeopardy.

According to informed sources, provinces such as Sichuan, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, as well as the Beijing and Tianjin municipalities, are all facing severe shortages of agricultural plastic film. However, strangely, many plastic film production factories in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, Zhejiang, Xi'an, Sichuan, and Henan are currently experiencing significant inventory backlogs. Some factories have had to halt or reduce production due to excessive capital tied up in inventory and a lack of storage space.

The primary cause of this situation is the recent tightening of credit, which has led to a severe shortage of funds for agricultural materials companies to purchase products. Another factor is the recent implementation of specialized management, which has disrupted the existing sales channels for some agricultural materials companies. The original sales channels of the production factories have been disrupted or severed, and the agricultural materials companies have not been able to quickly establish their own wholesale and sales networks, resulting in bottlenecks at certain stages.

Agricultural plastic film has been widely promoted in rural China in recent years and plays an increasingly important role in ensuring agricultural harvests. This product has a strong seasonal demand and cannot afford to miss the planting season. Relevant departments should take decisive measures to quickly deliver the produced plastic film to farmers and encourage factories to resume and increase the production of plastic film.

### 地膜产销出现怪现象  工厂积压停产　农民望眼欲穿

　　地膜产销出现怪现象
    工厂积压停产　农民望眼欲穿
    春耕大忙已经开始，不少省市农村急需的农用地膜出现了产销脱节的现象，需亟待解决。
    今年由于国家提高了棉花收购价格，农民种棉积极性高涨，许多地方都准备扩大棉田面积，却为买不到农用地膜而苦恼。山东省惠民地区是我国重点产棉区，今年全区共落实棉花种植面积３００多万亩，比去年增加４０多万亩，需要地膜５０００多吨。省农用物资公司计划供应１０５０吨，但现在农民实际买到４００吨，如近期内仍买不到所需农膜，棉花丰收将成泡影。
    据了解情况的人士告诉记者，四川、山东、河北、河南、山西、陕西等省和京津地区农村，都有农用地膜供应严重不足问题。但奇怪的是，目前北京、天津、青岛、大连、浙江、西安、四川、河南等许多省市生产农用地膜的塑料厂，产品却在大量积压，有不少厂因占用资金过多，无钱购买原料，加上仓库爆满，产品无地存放，被迫停产和半停产。目前天津塑料公司所属各厂已积压地膜３７００吨，四川省定点生产地膜的工厂共积压１５００吨。
    造成这种现象的主要原因之一，是近期银根抽紧，许多农业生产资料公司收购资金严重不足。另一个原因是，今年刚刚实行专营，有些地方农资公司的销售渠道不畅，生产厂原有的销售渠道被打乱或中断，农资公司又未能迅速建立起自己的批发和销售网络，在一些环节上出现了“中梗阻”现象。
    农膜近年来在我国农村大面积推广，对保证农业丰收起着越来越大的作用。这种产品需求季节性很强，误不得农时。有关部门应尽快采取果断措施，把生产出的农膜送到农民手中，并促使工厂早日恢复和增加农膜生产。
