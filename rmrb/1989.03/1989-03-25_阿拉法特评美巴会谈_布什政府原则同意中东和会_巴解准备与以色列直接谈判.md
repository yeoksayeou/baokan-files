Arafat Comments on US-Palestine Talks
Bush Administration Principally Agrees to Middle East Conference
PLO Prepares for Direct Talks with Israel

CAIRO, March 24 (Xinhua) — Correspondent Lin Jiaoming reports: PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat described the second round of official talks between the PLO and the United States as "positive" and "serious." He personally chaired a meeting of the PLO Executive Committee just hours after the talks concluded to discuss the results of the PLO-US talks.

Arafat's comments on the PLO-US talks were made at a press conference held in Tunis on March 23. He pointed out, "Both the PLO and the United States have a clear desire to continue bilateral dialogue and achieve results." He added that this round of talks "shows that the new U.S. administration is concerned about the PLO-US dialogue," despite Israel's efforts to sabotage and disrupt it. He expressed that the PLO's demand for a Middle East conference is clear. It requires that all parties to the Middle East dispute participate in the conference on an equal footing. This is similar to the positions of Western Europe, the Soviet Union, China, and non-aligned countries. He believes that the Bush administration has agreed in principle to hold a Middle East conference, but at the same time, the United States requires choosing a way to prepare for such an international conference through achieving direct talks between the PLO and Israel.

Arafat denied that there was any proposal for U.S. troops to replace Israeli forces in occupied territories.

Arafat revealed that before Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordanian King Hussein visit the United States, he will meet with them in Cairo to discuss the matter. He called for an Arab summit to be held in Riyadh to discuss the latest developments in the Palestinian issue, Egypt's return to the Arab League, and the Lebanese crisis. If Arab countries agree to hold an emergency summit, then the proposal by King Hassan II of Morocco to hold the summit in Rabat can be accepted.

The PLO Executive Committee meeting to study the results of the PLO-US talks is scheduled to last for two days. According to reports, the meeting was held in an "optimistic atmosphere." The meeting believed that the PLO-US dialogue has entered into substantive consultations on Middle East peace and is preparing for a Middle East conference. According to the analysis, the relationship and sequence of the Middle East conference and direct talks between the PLO and Israel may be the focus of this PLO meeting's discussions.

　　阿拉法特评美巴会谈        
    布什政府原则同意中东和会       
    巴解准备与以色列直接谈判
    本报开罗３月２４日电  记者林皎明报道：巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特认为，巴美第２轮正式会谈是“积极的”和“认真的”，并在会谈结束数小时后亲自主持召开执委会会议，研究巴美此轮会谈结果。
    阿拉法特主席对巴美会谈的这番评价是２３日在突尼斯召开的记者招待会上作出的。他还指出，“巴美双方都有确定无疑的愿望继续双边对话，并取得成果”。这次会谈“表明美国新政府关注美巴对话”，尽管以色列千方百计破坏和企图中断它。他表示，巴解组织要求召开中东和会的立场是明确的。它要求与中东争端各方以平等地位参加会议。这与西欧、苏联、中国和不结盟国家的立场相似。他认为，布什政府原则同意召开中东和会，但是美国同时要求选择通过实现巴以直接谈判筹备这样的国际会议的可能方式。
    阿拉法特主席否认有让美国部队取代以色列在被占领土据点的建议。
    阿拉法特透露，在埃及总统穆巴拉克和约旦国王侯赛因访美之前，他将与他们在开罗会晤磋商。他呼吁，在利雅得召开阿拉伯首脑会议，讨论巴勒斯坦问题的最新事态发展、埃及回归阿盟和黎巴嫩危机问题。如果阿拉伯各国同意召开紧急首脑会议，则可以接受摩洛哥国王哈桑二世的建议在拉巴特召开。
    研究美巴会谈结果的巴解执委会会议预定进行２天。据报道，会议“充满乐观气氛”。会议认为，美巴对话已经转入中东和平实质问题的磋商，并为中东和会做筹备工作。据分析，中东和会与巴以直接谈判的关系和先后顺序问题可能是巴解组织这次会议讨论的重点。
