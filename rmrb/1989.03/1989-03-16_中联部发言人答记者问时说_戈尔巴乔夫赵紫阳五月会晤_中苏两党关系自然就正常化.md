	Spokesperson of the International Liaison Department Says
	Gorbachev and Zhao Ziyang's Meeting in May Will Normalize Relations Between the Two Parties

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 15 -- (Reporters Yang Guoqang and intern reporter Pang Zhenyi) Spokesperson Wu Xingtang of the International Department of the Communist Party of China said today that when Soviet leader Gorbachev visits China in mid-May, he will meet with CPC Central Committee General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. The relations between the two parties will naturally normalize.

	The spokesperson, in an afternoon press conference in response to reporters' questions, said that the high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union signifies the beginning of the normalization of relations between the two countries. In the future, the relations between the two parties will not be the same as in the 1950s, but rather a new type of relationship based on new foundations.

	He said, "The Communist Party of China not only maintains broad contacts with communist parties around the world, but also with socialist parties, third-world developing countries' political parties, and other friendly parties."

	Wu Xingtang revealed that currently, there are nearly 260 friendly parties around the world that have exchanges with China. He said, "In our exchanges with these parties, we handle our relations with them based on the four principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs."

	The spokesperson also announced that, at the invitation of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party, the Central Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party, and the Central Committee of the San Marino Communist Party, Politburo member Song Ping will lead a CPC delegation tomorrow to attend the 18th National Congress of the Italian Communist Party in Rome and visit San Marino and Portugal.

    新华社北京３月１５日电  （记者杨国强、新闻实习生庞震毅）中共中央对外联络部发言人吴兴唐今天在这里说，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫５月中旬访华时，将同中共中央总书记赵紫阳会晤，中苏两党关系也就自然而然地正常化了。
    这位发言人在下午举行的新闻发布会上回答记者提问时表示，中苏高级会晤意味着中苏两国关系开始正常化。今后中苏两党关系不是５０年代的那种关系，而是在新的基础上的新型关系。
    他说，中国共产党不仅同世界上的共产党，而且同社会党、第三世界发展中国家的政党和其它友好政党也有广泛的联系。
    吴兴唐透露，现在，世界上同中共有交往的各种友好政党已有近２６０个。他说：“在同这些政党交往中，我们都是以独立自主、完全平等、互相尊重、互不干涉内部事务的４项原则来处理同它们的关系的”。
    这位发言人还宣布，应意大利共产党中央委员会、葡萄牙共产党中央委员会和圣马力诺共产党中央委员会的邀请，中共中央政治局委员宋平将于明天率领中共代表团，先后出席意大利共产党在罗马举行的第十八次全国代表大会和访问圣马力诺、葡萄牙。
