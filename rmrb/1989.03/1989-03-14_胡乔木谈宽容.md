People's Daily, Beijing, March 13th. Reporter Kong Xiaoning reports: Comrade Hu Qiaomu said today that our government and ruling party should adopt a tolerant attitude towards scientists and support them. When evaluating scientific research, one must use a scientific attitude and scientific methods.

At the celebration of the publication of the "Chinese Historical Atlas" held today at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Hu Qiaomu, currently serving as a Standing Committee member of the Central Advisory Commission and Honorary President of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, expressed the above views. He said that science and scientists fully deserve the respect and attention of society. The scientific cause is one that grows in the midst of difficulties and loneliness. Politicians, in their treatment of science and scientists, should first advocate and support, and second, maintain an objective attitude. An objective attitude can, to some extent, be said to be a tolerant attitude.

Hu Qiaomu believes that politicians are people who hold a certain amount of power and find it difficult to admit they are wrong. When they use a certain standard to measure the things around them, they will consider some things to meet the standard and others not to. In such a situation, one should advocate for a tolerant attitude.

Hu Qiaomu also believes that for leaders to truly adopt a tolerant attitude, they must shed the fixed ideas and habits formed over a long period of life, as well as their own interests. To make this tolerance truly realized, one must be prepared to acknowledge that even if an opinion is considered wrong, it has the right to exist.

He emphasized that leaders should not let their long-held habits and interests influence their judgment of scientific issues. Only in this way can China's science develop.

　　胡乔木谈宽容
    本报北京３月１３日讯  记者孔晓宁报道：胡乔木同志今天在此间说：我们的政府和执政党应该对科学家采取宽容的态度，支持他们。对于科学研究如要作评价，一定要用科学的态度，科学的方法。
    在中国社会科学院今天召开的《中国历史地图集》出版庆祝会上，目前担任中顾委常委和中国社会科学院名誉院长的胡乔木发表了上述看法。他说，科学和科学家完全有理由受到社会的尊重和重视。科学事业是在困难与寂寞中成长起来的。政治家们对待科学和科学家，一要倡导、支持，二要保持一种客观的态度。客观的态度在某种意义上也可以说是宽容的态度。
    胡乔木认为，政治家是掌握一定权力的人，很难承认自己是不正确的，当他对于周围事物用一种标准去衡量时，会认为某些合标准，某些不合标准。在这种情况下，就应要求采取宽容态度。
    胡乔木还认为，领导者要真正采取宽容的态度，就必须脱离自己长期生活中形成的固有观念，脱离自己的习惯和利害。为了让这种宽容真正实现，应有这种准备：即使认为某种意见是错误的，也要承认它有存在的权利。
    他强调指出：领导者不应让自己长期形成的习惯和利害影响自己对科学问题的判断，只有这样，中国的科学才能发展。
