When we heard that Comrade Zhu Yunqian's condition had worsened, we rushed to the hospital to visit him, but he could no longer greet us warmly and chat for a long time as he had in previous visits. Although we knew he would not be with us much longer, we still hoped he could spend another Chinese New Year with his family and us. However, just a week before the Spring Festival, he left us forever.

When we stood by Comrade Yunqian's body, we saw his pale face calm and serene, reflecting his guiltless and unrepentant heart before his death. This descendant of a poor peasant from Lianhua County, Jiangxi, was a leader of the children's team in his village during his youth. At the age of 12, he joined the Communist Youth League, and at 13, he joined the Red Army. From that time on, for more than half a century, he dedicated everything he had to the revolutionary and construction causes led by the Communist Party of China. During the war years, he fearlessly sacrificed himself, participating in and commanding many battles and campaigns, contributing to the liberation of the Chinese people. In peacetime, he worked diligently and conscientiously, achieving remarkable results whether in the military, academies, or leadership organs. During the ten years of turmoil, he was falsely accused and persecuted, but his faith remained unwavering, and he clearly distinguished right from wrong, resolutely resisting and fighting against the counter-revolutionary clique of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing. Through long-term rich practice, he was tempered into an outstanding military commander and an outstanding political work leader.

Losing such an old comrade is heartbreaking, especially for those who have worked with him.

We got to know Comrade Yunqian at different times and worked with him for varying lengths of time, but our impressions of him are consistent. If what we knew about his past was hearsay, then his words and deeds during his time at the General Political Department were what we witnessed firsthand. When he took up the position of Deputy Director of the General Political Department, it was a time of reconstruction after the Gang of Four had been smashed. The personnel work he was in charge of also faced numerous long-standing problems. This was undoubtedly a severe test for Comrade Yunqian—of his current work level, his revolutionary spirit, and even his physical health.

Just as he had done every time before when accepting tasks from the organization, Comrade Yunqian did not shrink back or fear. Instead, he immediately threw himself into the work with great enthusiasm. Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, under the leadership of the General Political Department Party Committee, he followed the instructions of the Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and Chairman Deng Xiaoping, and worked tirelessly on a large number of difficult and meticulous specific tasks. He analyzed the situation with his colleagues, listened carefully to feedback from all sides, and studied ways to solve problems. Whenever there was work to be done, whether in the office or at home, whether during the day or at night, he was always available for discussion. He had no hobbies to begin with, so he had even less time to rest.

His health had been good, but it deteriorated due to overwork. However, he paid no heed to his own well-being and continued to devote himself to his work. I remember during an important meeting, he fell ill and was sent to the hospital. As soon as he felt a bit better, he disregarded the doctor's advice and continued to attend the meeting. He often dragged his weak body to the troops, investigating the situation of various levels of cadres, grassroots cadres, and retired senior cadres, and studying solutions. Even when he was recuperating in another place, he took the time to visit nearby rest homes and coastal defense troops to see the cadres and soldiers. It was because of this that he could propose insightful suggestions and opinions based on reality, providing a basis and reference for the decisions of the Military Commission and the General Political Department. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the progress and achievements made in the construction of the cadre team in our army also reflected Comrade Yunqian's heart and contribution!

When Comrade Yunqian did personnel work, he insisted on fairness and impartiality, caring for and loving cadres, and valuing the training and improvement of cadres. He actively implemented the decisions of the Military Commission, stabilizing cadres in thought and organization, striving to promote the normal replacement of old and new cadres through planned entry and promotion, so that cadres could work solidly for a few years in a position, undergo tempering, accumulate experience, and enhance their abilities. To this end, he devoted a lot of effort to the training of cadres, seriously and solidly grasping the basic training and level training of cadres. In 1980, Chairman Deng proposed selecting some young, educated outstanding cadres to be trained in academies. Comrade Yunqian personally led the department's cadres to the troops to select candidates. After recommendations from various levels of party committees, he successively selected five batches of outstanding battalion and regimental cadres in their 40s with high school education or above and good moral and intellectual qualities to be trained and further educated in academies, providing a talent pool for the realization of the "four modernizations" of the military cadre team. During a trip to the troops to attend a meeting, he discovered that a leading cadre team was not cohesive, so he had individual and collective talks with the members of the team, reasoning with them and appealing to their emotions, which enhanced the team's cohesion.

For senior cadres, Comrade Yunqian also cared for and helped them with deep feelings. During the ten years of turmoil, many senior cadres were persecuted. To ensure that the wrongful cases of these senior cadres were rectified as soon as possible, Comrade Yunqian followed the regulations of the Central Committee and the Military Commission, doing a great deal of work to solve many historical problems. In recent years, many veteran cadres who had fought in the north and south and were advanced in age had retired from the front line. Comrade Yunqian not only ensured their political and living treatment according to the party's policies but also valued their expertise and role in the four modernizations of the country. He thought of many ways to manage the rest homes and arrange for retired cadres, combining the actual situation of the troops. For the practical difficulties and problems raised by retired cadres, as long as they were within the scope of the policy, he did his best to help solve them. In April 1986, while recuperating in Guangzhou, he also visited several rest homes, held a symposium with retired cadres, listened to their opinions, and required the staff of the rest homes to do a good job, so that those who had made contributions to the Chinese revolution and construction could enjoy a peaceful old age and live a healthy life.

Comrade Yunqian is a high-ranking cadre of our army who grew from a Red Army soldier. Throughout his long revolutionary career, he always put the party's needs and interests first, without considering personal fame and status, and never used his power for personal gain. Sometimes when he was in a deputy position, he required himself to do more specific work and took responsibility when there were problems. At the beginning of the founding of the country, to build a modernized new type of troops, he was transferred from the military chief of staff to the position of division commander. He had no complaints about this and devoted himself wholeheartedly to his work. When working with younger and less experienced comrades, he always put the party's cause first, never acted senior, and discussed matters with others. For the work of others, whenever needed, he helped with ideas and methods, actively providing assistance. In the leading cadre team, when the names of younger comrades were listed before his, he paid more attention to respecting and supporting their work, showing the broad-mindedness of a communist. It was because of this that people respected him more. Many people were deeply moved when they talked about Comrade Yunqian's character. We ourselves also have personal experiences.

The style of integrity and honesty is also well reflected in Comrade Yunqian, worthy of our learning. He had strict requirements for his family members and children and never said a word about arranging for his children. For gifts from inside and outside the military, he politely declined, and when he could not decline, he paid more than the actual price. Not long before his death, comrades from Lianhua County who came to Beijing to participate in the old revolutionary base commodity exhibition brought him two local duck breasts, two bottles of wine, and a pound of tea leaves, saying it was the intention of the local people. He firmly declined, so he sent someone to deliver 100 yuan and a letter, saying, "I appreciate the deep affection, but the living conditions of the people in the old revolutionary base are still difficult, please definitely accept this money, hoping that the hometown will prosper soon."

Although he had done a lot of work for the party and the people and had many virtues, he always examined his thoughts and work. In 1984, during the party's rectification and personal self-examination, he seriously examined the shortcomings and deficiencies in his work, deeply analyzed his thoughts, formulated measures, and strove to improve in practice. When he knew his condition was critical and his days were numbered, he still reported his thoughts to the party group leader. He reviewed his life, with tears in his eyes, saying, "I have been in the party for over 50 years, done some work for the party, and consider myself a qualified party member, but there are also unqualified aspects. I hope to hear the comrades' criticisms for the last time!" This was his last heart-to-heart talk with the party before his death.

Seventy years ago in this season, Comrade Zhu Yunqian came into the world; seventy years later in this season, he left us hurriedly. In the early spring of Beijing, we irrevocably bid farewell to this outstanding party member of the Communist Party of China, a loyal communist warrior who has been tested by time, but his achievements, his thoughts, his character, and his style will always remain deeply in our memory, never to be forgotten!

　　我们不会忘记他        
    ——悼念朱云谦同志
    听说朱云谦同志病情转重，我们急忙赶到医院看望时，他已不能像前几次那样，久久握住我们的手亲切交谈了。尽管知道他将不久于人世，但还是希望他能和他的家人及我们一起再过一个中国人民传统的春节。可是距春节只有一个星期的时候，他却离开了我们，永远地离开了。
    当我们站在云谦同志的遗体旁，看到他苍白的脸庞安详而坦然，映现出他临终前心中的无愧无悔。这个井冈山下莲花县贫苦农民的后代，少年时期就是乡儿童团的负责人，１２岁加入共青团，１３岁参加工农红军。从那时开始的半个多世纪的时间里，他把他的一切，都毫无保留地全部奉献给了中国共产党领导的革命和建设事业。战争岁月，他舍生忘死，无所畏惧，参加和指挥过许多战役战斗，为中国人民的解放事业做出了贡献；和平年代，他勤勤恳恳，兢兢业业，不论在部队、院校还是领导机关，都做了卓有成效的工作；在十年动乱中，他受到诬陷和迫害，但信仰不渝，是非分明，对林彪、江青反革命集团进行了坚决的抵制和斗争。长期的丰富实践，把他锻炼成为一位优秀的军事指挥员，一位优秀的政治工作领导者。
    失去了这样一位老同志，怎能不令人哀痛呢？何况又是与他一起工作过的人。
    我们和云谦同志的相识有先有后，共事时间有长有短，但对他的突出印象却是一致的。如果说对他过去的情况是耳闻的话，那么他在总政期间的言行则是我们亲眼所见。他调任总政副主任时，正值粉碎“四人帮”以后的百废待举之际，他分管的干部工作，同样面临着多年积存的一个个难题。这对云谦同志无疑是一个严峻的考验，现有工作水平的考验，革命事业心的考验，也包括身体的考验。
    像过去每一次接受组织交给的任务一样，云谦同志没有畏惧，没有退缩，而是立即满腔热情地投入工作。特别是党的第十一届三中全会后，他按照党中央、中央军委和邓小平主席的指示精神，在总政党委领导下，竭尽全力地做着大量的、棘手的、细致的具体工作。他和机关同志一起分析情况，认真听取来自各方面的反映，研究解决问题的办法。只要是工作上的事，不论在办公室还是家里，不论白天还是黑夜，都可以随时找他谈。本来就没有什么业余爱好的他，就更没有休息的时间了。
    他的身体原先是不错的，由于劳累而变得较差了，但他不顾自己，仍然一心扑在工作上。记得一次重要会议期间，他病了被送进医院，身体刚好一些就不顾医生劝阻继续参加会议。他还常常拖着病弱的身体到部队去，调查各级班子、基层干部和离退休老干部的情况，研究解决的办法。就是在外地疗养时，他也抽时间到附近的干休所和海防部队的连队去看望干部战士。正因为这样，他才能从实际出发，提出有见解的建议和意见，为军委和总政决策提供依据与参考。十一届三中全会后，我军干部队伍建设上所取得的进步和成绩，也渗透着云谦同志的一份心血，一份贡献啊！
    云谦同志做干部工作时坚持公道正派，关心爱护干部，重视干部的培训和提高。他积极贯彻军委的决议，从思想上和组织上稳定干部，力争通过有计划的进出、晋升，促进新老正常交替，使干部在一个岗位上扎扎实实干几年，经受锻炼，积累经验，增长才干。为此，他在干部的培养训练上倾注了不少心血，认真扎实地抓好干部的基础训练和本级训练。１９８０年，邓主席提出选些年轻、有文化的优秀干部到院校培养后，云谦同志亲自带领机关干部到部队物色对象，经各级党委推荐，先后选了五批４０岁左右、具有高中以上文化程度、德才条件好的优秀师、团干部送院校培养深造，为实现军队干部队伍的“四化”提供了人才来源。一次，他到部队参加一个会议的过程中，发现有个领导班子不够团结协调，就找这个班子的成员逐个谈心，集体谈话，晓之以理，动之以情，使这个班子增强了团结。
    对老干部，云谦同志也是以深厚的感情关心、帮助他们。在十年动乱中，许多老干部遭到迫害。为使这些老干部的冤假错案尽快得到平反，云谦同志遵照党中央和军委的规定，做了大量的工作，解决了不少历史遗留问题。近几年，许多南征北战、年事已高的老干部从第一线退了下来，云谦同志不仅按党的政策，在保证他们的政治、生活待遇上做了许多工作，而且还重视他们的专长和作用，在国家四化建设中发挥余热。对干休所的管理、离休干部的安置，他结合部队实际，想了好多办法。离休干部提出的一些实际困难和问题，凡在政策允许的范围内，他都尽量帮助解决。１９８６年４月，他在广州疗养休息的时候，还去看望了几个干休所，召开离休干部座谈会，征求他们的意见，要求干休所的工作人员切实把工作做好，使那些曾经为中国革命和建设事业作出过贡献的老同志能安度晚年，健康长寿。
    云谦同志是一位从红军小战士成长起来的我军高级干部。在他长期的革命生涯中，一贯把党的需要、党的利益摆在第一位，不计较个人名利地位，不以职权谋取私利。有时担任副职，他就要求自己多做具体事情，有了问题也勇于承担责任。建国之初，为建设现代化的新兵种，他从军参谋长调任为师长。对此，他毫无怨言，全身心地做好工作。在与比他年龄小、资历短的同志一起共事时，他总是以党的事业为重，从不摆老资格，遇事相互商量；对别人分管的工作，凡需要时，他帮助出主意想办法，积极给予协助。在领导班子里，当比他年轻的同志的名字排到他的前面时，他更注意尊重、支持其工作，表现了共产党人的宽阔胸怀。正因为这样，人们更尊敬他。不少人说到云谦同志这方面的思想品格时，都十分感动。我们自己，也有亲身的体会。
    清正廉洁的作风，在云谦同志身上也有着很好的体现，值得我们学习。他对家属子女要求严格，从未为孩子的安排说过一句话。对军内军外送来的礼品，他婉言拒绝，实在拒绝不了时，就以超过实际价格的钱付款。在他逝世前不久，莲花县来京参加老区开发商品展览会的同志，给他带来家乡的土特产两只板鸭、两瓶酒和一斤茶叶，说这是家乡人民的心意。他坚辞不掉，就派人送去１００元钱和一封信，信中说，这深情厚意我领了，但老区人民的生活还很困难，这点钱请一定要收下，希望家乡早日富裕起来。
    尽管他为党为人民做了大量工作，有很多优点，但他仍然时时检查自己的思想和工作。１９８４年整党个人对照检查时，他认真检讨工作中的缺点和不足，对思想作深刻的解剖，制定了措施，并在以后的实践中努力改进。在他自知病情危重、来日无多的时候，还向党小组长作思想汇报。他回顾自己的一生，噙着泪水说：“我入党５０多年，为党做了一些工作，自认为是个合格的党员，但也有不合格的地方，我希望能最后一次听到同志们的批评！”这是他生前向党最后一次交心。
    ７０年前的这个季节，朱云谦同志来到了人间；７０年后的这个季节，他又匆匆地离去了。在北京的初春里，我们无可挽回地送走了这位中国共产党的优秀党员，久经考验的忠诚的共产主义战士，但他的业绩，他的思想，他的品格，他的作风，却依然深深留在我们的记忆之中，永远难以忘怀！
