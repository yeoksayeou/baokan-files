The scientific and technological community is facing three impacts
— Yao Jinzhong discusses concerns and hopes

People's Daily reporter Wang Xingzeng

Yao Jinzhong, a delegate to the National People's Congress who has been engaged in scientific and technological work since the 1960s, is currently the director of the Shantou Ultrasonic Instrument Research Institute. In a conversation with a reporter, he expressed concerns about the current state of the scientific and technological workforce.

He said that Premier Li Peng, in his government work report, once again emphasized that the development and progress of science and technology are the true hope for the revitalization of China's economy, and that efforts should be made to organize and implement the national key scientific and technological research projects during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period. Currently, the vast majority of projects in the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" key scientific and technological research projects are completed by state-owned enterprises. However, due to the lack of coordination in the reform of the scientific and technological system, the scientific and technological community is facing three impacts.

The first is the impact of inflation. Nowadays, the tendency to pursue money is very serious, and no one wants to engage in high technology. Many scientific and technological personnel are engaged in second jobs and cannot concentrate on scientific research. Imagine, has any Nobel Prize winner ever divided his attention to engage in a second job?

The second is the impact of the reversal of mental and physical labor. This impact has caused instability in the scientific and technological workforce. For example, our institute has four university graduates who have worked for four years. Now they have resigned to work in the special economic zone for foreign trade, earning more than 300 yuan per month, which is more than us. However, the state has nurtured them for so many years, and now they are doing work that has nothing to do with what they have learned.

The third is the impact of unequal competition among various types of ownership, that is, state-owned research institutes do not have equal competition with collective and individual enterprises. Many people who have achieved success in scientific and technological positions are hired away by collective and individual enterprises with high salaries, and their salaries and housing can be solved. However, we state-owned units do not have this ability and power. Such mobility is difficult to say is a reasonable flow.

Yao Jinzhong hopes that the state will make a decision to take corresponding protective measures and provide a scientific and technological environment for scientific and technological personnel to concentrate on science and technology.

　　科技界面临三个冲击        
    ——姚锦钟谈忧虑与希望
    本报记者  王行增
    从６０年代开始从事科技工作的人大代表姚锦钟，现任汕头超声仪器研究所所长。在同记者的交谈中，他对当前科技队伍的现状表示了忧虑。
    他说，李鹏总理在政府工作报告中再次强调，科学技术的发展和进步是实现我国经济振兴的真正希望所在，要求抓紧“七五”期间国家科技攻关计划的组织实施。目前，“七五”科技攻关计划的绝大多数项目是靠全民所有制企业完成，但由于科技体制改革的不配套，科技界正面临着三个冲击。
    第一个是通货膨胀的冲击。现在向钱看的倾向很严重，高科技没有人愿搞。一些科技人员纷纷从事第二职业，不能集中精力搞科研。试想哪一个诺贝尔奖金获得者曾经分心去搞第二职业呢？
    第二个是脑体倒挂的冲击。这个冲击造成科技队伍的不稳定。例如，我们研究所有４名大学生，工作了４年，如今辞职到特区搞外贸，每月收入３００多元，比我们多。可是国家培养了他们这么多年，而现在干的跟学的根本无关。
    第三个是多种所有制竞争不平等的冲击，就是说全民所有制的科研所同集体、个体企业之间没有平等的竞争。许多在科技岗位有成就的人，被集体、个体企业高薪聘走，工资、房子都能解决。而我们全民所有制单位就没有这个能力和权力。这种流动很难说是合理的流动。
    姚锦钟希望国家下决心采取相应的保护措施，为科技人员提供一个一心一意搞科技的环境。
