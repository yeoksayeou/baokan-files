Yue Mountain Township in our county has engaged in fabrication and favoritism in its marriage registration work. From 1985 to 1987, this township issued marriage certificates to 350 couples, among whom 79 couples did not meet the legal marriage age. One girl under the age of 15 also received a marriage certificate. Among these cases, 7 couples were approved collectively by the township government, and 31 couples were approved individually by township leaders who wrote notes or expressed their opinions. The marriage registration clerk, in order to meet the improper demands of some township leaders' relatives and acquaintances, even altered the birth dates on the household registration books.

　　月山乡婚姻登记中弄虚作假
    我县月山乡在婚姻登记工作中弄虚作假，徇私舞弊。１９８５年至１９８７年，这个乡为３５０对青年男女办理了结婚登记，其中竟有７９对不够法定婚龄，１名不满１５岁的少女也领到了结婚证。这里面有７对是经乡政府集体同意给办理的；有３１对是乡领导人个人批条子、表态后给办理的。乡婚姻登记员为了满足个别乡领导人的亲友、熟人的不正当要求，竟涂改户口簿上的出生日期。
