After the Second World War, a noticeable change in the armed forces of various countries is the significant increase in the number of female soldiers. Countries that previously did not recruit female soldiers have now lifted the ban; countries that only allowed female soldiers to perform non-combat duties have expanded the scope. In the United States, female soldiers can perform strategic duty shifts in underground nuclear launch control centers, just like male soldiers. Female soldiers in Denmark are allowed to board any ship except submarines. Now, many countries recognize that women are an important force in the national armed forces, and some countries with small populations and limited manpower are paying more attention to recruiting female soldiers.

Currently, how many female soldiers are there in the world? According to relevant statistics, there are about 500,000 female soldiers worldwide, accounting for about 2% of the world's total military strength of 26.6 million. Among them, NATO has the most, with 13 out of 15 member countries having female soldiers, totaling nearly 300,000, accounting for 6.6% of NATO's total military strength of 4.5 million and 60% of the world's total number of female soldiers. In comparison, the countries in the Warsaw Pact have far fewer female soldiers, with only about 20,000.

The country with the most female soldiers in the world is the United States, with approximately 200,000 to 220,000 female soldiers, accounting for 40% to 45% of the world's total number of female soldiers, 70% of NATO's total number of female soldiers, and 10% of the total number of U.S. military personnel. In comparison, the Soviet Union has about 10,000 female soldiers, accounting for only 2% of the Soviet Union's total military strength. Apart from the U.S. and the Soviet Union, other countries with a relatively high number of female soldiers include Canada with 20,000, the United Kingdom with 16,000, France with 12,500, Israel with 12,000, the Netherlands with 4,500, Greece with 900, Norway with 450, and West Germany with 150, which is the least among NATO countries.

China is the country with the second-highest number of female soldiers in the world, with approximately 100,000 active-duty military personnel, of whom 80% are on the technological front. For example, in the naval technological cadre, women make up more than half, truly living up to the name of "half of the sky."

Currently, the vast majority of female soldiers are enlisted personnel or non-commissioned officers, with very few becoming commissioned officers, and even fewer becoming high-ranking officers.

　　世界女兵知多少？
    余洋　章臣
    第二次世界大战后，各国军队中一个明显的变化，是女兵大大增多了。过去不招收女兵的，现在开禁了；原来只准女兵担当非战斗任务的，现在也扩大了范围。美国的女兵可以同男兵一样，在地下核发射控制中心担任战略值班任务。丹麦女兵被准许登上除潜艇以外的任何舰船。现在，不少国家认识到，女性是国家武装部队的一支重要力量，一些人口少，兵源匮乏的国家，更重视招收女兵。
    目前世界上的女兵有多少？据有关资料统计，总共有五十万人左右，约占世界总兵力二千六百六十万人的百分之二左右。其中，北约集团最多，十五个成员国中十三个国家有女兵，接近三十万人，占北约集团总兵力四百五十万人的百分之六点六，占世界女兵总数的百分之六十。与之相比，华约集团各国的女兵要少得多，只有二万多人。
    世界女兵最多的国家是美国，目前大约有二十至二十二万人，占世界女兵总数的百分之四十至四十五，占北约集团女兵总数的百分之七十左右，占美国军人总数的百分之十左右。与之相比，苏联的女兵有一万人左右，仅占苏联军队总兵力的百分之二左右。除美苏之外，其他女兵较多的国家还有，加拿大二万人，英国一万六千人，法国一万二千五百人，以色列一万二千人，荷兰四千五百人，希腊九百人，挪威四百五十人，联邦德国一百五十人，是北约集团中女兵最少的。
    中国是世界上仅次于美国的女兵最多的国家，目前有现役军人约十万人，其中百分之八十分布在科技战线上，如海军科技干部中，妇女占了一半以上，是名副其实的“半边天”。
    眼下，绝大多数女兵是士兵或军士，升为军官的极少，高级军官更是稀少。
