	Associate Professor Wang Houde from Tianjin Medical College recently resigned from his position and moved to a rural area in Hebei Province to settle down. He now serves as the technical director of a privately-run biological technology research institute.

	Last spring, Wang Houde went to Yuxing Township in Cang County, Hebei Province, and helped local farmers Wang Maopu and others establish this biological technology research institute and experimental factory. This allowed his meticulously researched and successfully developed live strain BE yeast feed additive technology to bear fruit. By adding BE yeast to feed for chickens, ducks, fish, and other animals, the production of meat and eggs can be increased by 10%, and the disease rate can be reduced by more than 20%.

　　副教授王厚德下乡办科研所
    据新华社石家庄３月２８日电  天津市医学院副教授王厚德最近辞职到河北省农村安家落户，担任一家民办生物技术研究所的技术负责人。
    去年春天，王厚德到河北沧县兴济镇余庆屯村，帮助农民王茂普等建起了这个生物技术研究所和实验工厂，使自己精心研究成功的活菌种ＢＥ酵母饲料添加剂生产技术在这里结出了果实。将ＢＥ酵母加入鸡、鸭、鱼等饲料中，可提高肉、蛋产量１０％，使疾病率降低２０％以上。
