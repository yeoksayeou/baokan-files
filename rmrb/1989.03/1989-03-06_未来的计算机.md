A reader asked, is it possible to create computers using non-electronic components in the future, since electronic computers are made from electronic components?

Comrade Tairan responds to this question: It is anticipated that several new types of computers will emerge in the future.

Optical Computers

Generally speaking, the speed of a computer mainly depends on the time it takes for each switching device to change state. Currently, the fastest electronic devices have a switching speed that cannot be less than one billionth of a second, meaning the operating speed of computers is difficult to exceed one billion operations per second. Therefore, even the most advanced electronic computers today are far behind the human brain in terms of functionality.

The rapid development of laser technology has inspired people: can lasers be used to transmit signals and create optical computers (also known as laser computers)? Theoretically, the computing speed of optical computers can reach one trillion operations per second, which is a thousand times faster than current computers and has a storage capacity a million times larger. It is predicted that digital optical computers may be realized by the year 2000.

Biological Computers

The "language" used by electronic computers to transmit information ultimately consists of only "0" and "1," which correspond to "on" and "off."

If organic molecules also possess "on" and "off" functions, they can become the basic components of computers, thus creating organic computers.

Scientists have discovered that some semi-quinone organic compounds and hydrogen in protein molecules possess "on" and "off" electrical properties. Therefore, theoretically, it is possible to manufacture semi-quinone or protein-type computers. Biological computers may have the characteristics of being small in size and high in efficiency; they can utilize the inherent self-regulating functions of biological organisms; and the biochemical components made of organic molecules operate through chemical reactions, so they require very little energy to run the machine.

Superconducting Computers

The operating speed of superconducting electronic devices is 10 to 100 times faster than current integrated circuits, and the power consumption is only one-thousandth of that of integrated circuits. With the continuous advancement of research and application of high-temperature superconducting materials, the birth of superconducting computers by the year 2000 is hopeful.

Fuzzy Computers

So far, electronic computers have a noticeable flaw: a large amount of fuzzy information in natural phenomena and human society is difficult for computers to process, sometimes even rendering them helpless. The world is vast and ever-changing, and it is difficult to describe human brain thinking using simple logical systems such as "yes" and "no," "on" and "off," "true" and "false."

When humans first developed computers, they intended to use the decimal system, but they struggled to find devices that could stably output 10 different states. Certain crystals used in optical computer hardware can produce a continuous increase in transmitted light intensity as the incident light intensity increases. By reasonably selecting some states of the transmitted light intensity, a multi-valued logic system can be realized, which is the foundation of the computer logic system for processing fuzzy information. Therefore, the breakthrough in devices that can output more than two stable states (or multi-stable devices) is the key to developing fuzzy computers. The advent of optical fuzzy computers will be a matter of the year 2000. This type of computer, which possesses artificial intelligence, will have a profound impact on human society.

　　未来的计算机
    泰然
    有读者问，电子计算机是用电子器件构成的计算机，将来是否能用其他非电子器件制成计算机呢？
    泰然同志就此作了回答：预计未来将会出现几种崭新的计算机。
    光学计算机
    一般来说，计算机的速度主要取决于每个开关器件改变状态所需要的时间。而目前最快的电子器件的开关速度也难以小于十亿分之一秒，也就是说，计算机的运行速度很难超过每秒十亿次。因此，目前最先进的电子计算机的功能与人脑相比还差得很远。
    激光技术的迅猛发展启迪了人们：可否利用激光来传送信号制造出光学计算机（也称激光计算机）呢？从理论上讲，光学计算机的运算速度可高达一万亿次，这要比目前计算机的速度快上千倍，存储容量大百万倍。预测，光学数字式计算机有可能在２０００年前后实现。
    生物计算机
    电子计算机传送信息的“语言”归根到底只有“０”和“１”两种，恰恰与“开”和“关”相对应。
    如果有机物分子也具备了“开”和“关”的功能，它也就能成为计算机的基本元件，从而创造出有机计算机。
    科学家们发现，一些半醌类有机化合物以及蛋白质分子中的氢具备“开”和“关”的电气性能。因此，从理论上讲，可能制造出半醌型或蛋白质型计算机。生物计算机可能具备的特点是，体积小，功效高；能发挥生物本身固有的自我调节机能；由有机分子构成的生物化学元件是通过化学反应工作的，所以，只需很少的能量，机器就能运行。
    超导计算机
    超导电子器件的工作速度要比现在的集成电路快１０至１００倍，而功耗仅为集成电路的千分之一。随着高温超导材料的研究和应用不断深入，２０００年前后超导计算机的诞生是有希望的。
    模糊计算机
    迄今为止的电子计算机有一个明显的缺点：自然现象和人类社会中的大量模糊信息较难为计算机所处理，有时甚至使计算机无能为力。大千世界变化无穷，简单地用“有”与“无”、“开”与“关”、“是”与“非”等逻辑体系是很难描述人的大脑思维的。
    在人类研制计算机之初，打算应用十进位数制，但苦于无法寻得能够稳定输出１０种状态的器件。光学计算机硬件采用的某些晶体能随入射光强度的连续增大产生透射光强度连续提高的现象，合理地选取透射光强度的一些状态就能实现多值逻辑系统，而这种系统则是用于处理模糊信息的计算机逻辑系统的基础。因此，能够输出两个以上稳定状态的器件（或者说多稳态器件）的突破是研制模糊计算机的关键。光学模糊计算机的问世将是２０００年后的事。这种具有人工智能的计算机对人类社会产生的影响将是极其重大的。
