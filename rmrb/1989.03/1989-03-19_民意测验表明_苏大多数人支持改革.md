The director of the All-Union Center for Public Opinion Research, Zaslavskaya, said that the majority of Soviet people support the ongoing reforms, with only a small number opposing them.

She made these remarks at a press conference held on the evening of the 17th in Moscow. She said that a recent public opinion poll showed that 70% of residents actively support the reforms, with intellectuals being the most enthusiastic; 15% of residents sympathize with the reforms, 11% are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and only 4% are opposed to the reforms.

Zaslavskaya also revealed that 80% of those surveyed believe the pace of reform is too slow. About three-quarters of these people base their judgment on the supply of consumer goods, and 55% of people view the reforms based on price stability. She believes that, judging from the recent resolution passed by the Central Committee of the CPSU to fundamentally change agricultural policy, 1989 will be a turning point in the supply of food and consumer goods to residents.

Regarding the public's attitude towards the proposed price reforms, this academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences said that 20% have no clear opinion on the matter, another 20% express support, but 60% of residents oppose price reforms, believing it will lead to a significant increase in the prices of daily consumer goods.

　　民意测验表明
    苏大多数人支持改革
    新华社莫斯科３月１８日电  全苏舆论研究中心主任扎斯拉夫斯卡娅说，大多数苏联人都支持目前正在进行的改革，只有少数人持反对态度。
    她是１７日晚在此间举行的记者招待会上说这番话的。她说，最近举行的一次民意测验表明，７０％的居民积极拥护改革，其中以知识分子的态度最为积极；１５％的居民同情改革，１１％的人持观望态度，反对改革者只占４％。
    扎斯拉夫斯卡娅还透露，８０％的被调查者认为改革速度缓慢，其中约有３／４的人是根据消费品供应状况作此判断的，５５％的人是根据物价是否稳定来看待改革的。她认为，从刚刚结束的苏共中央全会通过的根本改变农业政策的决议来看，在居民的食品和消费品供应方面，１９８９年将是转折之年。
    谈到居民对拟议中的价格改革所持的态度时，这位苏联科学院院士说，２０％的人对此无明确看法，另有２０％的人表示支持，但有６０％的居民反对进行物价改革，认为它会导致一系列日用消费品大幅度涨价。
