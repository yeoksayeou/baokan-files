Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, March 23rd. Reporter Wang Aisheng reports: The Taiyuan Aluminum Factory in Shanxi Province has implemented a housing reform plan titled "Public Ownership of Housing, Mortgage Leasing, Paid Allocation, Interest in Lieu of Rent," which has been widely welcomed by employees. As of yesterday, 41 units of housing have been allocated, and over 90,000 yuan in mortgage payments have been collected.

The factory completed a residential building in 1988 and is currently constructing another. A total of 80 units are available for employee allocation. The factory, based on the spirit of housing reform and the actual affordability of most of its employees, proposed a simple and feasible housing reform plan: Housing allocation still follows the conditions of public housing for private use, prioritizing based on housing shortage severity, length of service, time of entry into the factory, and technical title level. For a three-bedroom unit, 3,000 yuan in mortgage payments are required; for a two-bedroom unit, 2,200 yuan. The housing is for long-term personal use, and the residents' children and direct relatives have permanent use rights, but they cannot transfer or lease the property. Rent is waived (water, heating, and gas are charged according to regulations), and the mortgage interest is used to cover the rent, with no additional subsidy fees provided to the residents. If, after several years, the resident is transferred to another job, the housing is returned upon departure, and the mortgage is refunded without interest.

According to preliminary calculations, 3,000 yuan in mortgage payments deposited in the bank, with a five-year fixed term, can yield an annual interest of 450 yuan, averaging 37.50 yuan per month, nearly ten times the current rent. If the five-year interest is reinvested, starting from the sixth year, the monthly interest can reach 65.25 yuan. This plan has been widely welcomed by the employees.

Recently, Taiyuan Aluminum Factory Director Yang Wenfu wrote to central leaders, proposing to promote this plan. Yang Wenfu wrote: "There are at least 50 million units of public housing nationwide. If each unit is determined based on the income level of employees in different regions, it is estimated that each unit can collect between 3,000 and 5,000 yuan in mortgage payments (higher amounts can exceed 10,000 yuan), which is completely feasible. If an average of 4,000 yuan per unit is collected, 50 million units can generate 200 billion yuan in cash, which will have a significant impact on stabilizing the market." "This approach can help to withdraw currency, increase revenue, reduce expenditures, stabilize prices, and reduce collective purchasing power, expanding investment in infrastructure, which is a beneficial policy for both the country and the people."

　　住房公有　抵押出租　有偿分配　以息代租        
    太原铝材厂房改方案简便易行
    本报太原３月２３日电  记者王艾生报道：山西省太原铝材厂试行“住房公有，抵押出租，有偿分配，以息代租”的住房改革方案，受到职工普遍欢迎。截至昨天，已分配住房４１套，收回抵押金９万多元。
    该厂１９８８年建成住宅楼一栋，同时，又在兴建一栋。可供职工分配的住房共８０套。厂里根据住房改革的精神，以及本厂大多数职工的实际承受能力，提出了一个简便易行的住房改革方案：住房分配仍按照公房私住的条件，以住房紧缺程度、工龄长短、入厂时间、技术职称高低等分先后进行。分得一套三居室，交抵押金３０００元；分得一套二居室，交抵押金２２００元。归本人长期居住，住户的子女及直系亲属享有永久使用权，但不得转让，不得出租。免收房租（水、暖、煤气按规定收费），以抵押金利息顶租，不再发给住户补贴费。若干年后，如调动工作，人走交房，押金退还，不付利息。
    据初步计算，３０００元抵押金存入银行，以定期五年计算，每年可得利息４５０元，平均每月３７．５０元，高出现行房租近十倍。把五年利息再存入银行，从第六年起，月息可达６５．２５元。这个方案，职工群众普遍欢迎。
    太原铝材厂厂长杨文福最近给中央领导同志写信，提出推行这种方案的建议。杨文福写道：“全国至少有５０００万套公房，每套按不同地区职工收入承受能力来确定押金，估计每套收３０００—５０００元（高者可超１万元）完全可以行通。如平均以４０００元一套计，５０００万套可一次性收回押金２０００亿元现金，这对稳定市场有着巨大作用。”“既可回笼货币，增收节支，稳定物价，又可减少集团购买力，扩大基建投资，是利国利民的好事。”
