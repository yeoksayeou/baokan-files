Wang Ping and Her Art

Wang Ping is a pure and profound woman.

Two years ago, the 32-year-old Wang Ping brought over a hundred of her ceramic and wood sculptures to the China Art Museum for an exhibition. The exhibition, with its strong folk and ethnic characteristics and modern artistic atmosphere, attracted the attention of the art world. Tomorrow, she will bring 30 metal sculptures and 50 prints to the central hall of the China Art Museum once again.

Wang Ping's clothing and expressions all exude the simplicity and clarity of the Guizhou plateau. When she talks about her various feelings towards art, her profound thoughts are truly surprising.

"I believe that the true success of an art exhibition is the spiritual state presented in the exhibition hall. It is familiar yet unfamiliar to the audience. It is familiar because it possesses the language of this cultural circle, and it is unfamiliar because people do not know that this spiritual state is the manifestation of their own culture. They feel both mystery and familiarity from it."

Interacting with Wang Ping, you will be infected by her aggressive demeanor. She often has imaginative ideas and unconstrained frankness. She does not create based on concepts but rather on the direct sensations and imagination of life. As long as she feels and imagines it, her hands will execute it. Whether it is figurative, distorted, or abstract, she can skillfully combine them into a whole. Perhaps this is because Wang Ping has never attended an art academy and has not undergone formal training, so she does not need to standardize or restrict herself with a set of rules, but rather develops her unique artistic personality naturally—along the trajectory of distortion, abstraction, and composite construction. Facing Wang Ping's works is like facing primitive life; they are simple, unconstrained, joyful when they want to be, and angry when they want to be.

Wang Ping has practiced Chinese painting, printmaking, and oil painting, but she believes that sculpture is the most satisfying, allowing her to carve out a living person with real knives and axes. Wang Ping's purpose in pursuing art is to understand people, discover people, create people, and inspire people. Art is first and foremost for people.

This time, the bronze sculpture "Huabiao II" is an image of a mother. The emaciated and aged mother, kneeling on the ground, struggles to support her dozens of children, with a distorted shape resembling a Huabiao. Wang Ping told me, "The Chinese concept is that children are raised by their parents from birth to old age. The mother is very poor and the burden is extremely heavy. The children only know how to complain, but no one thinks about their own mother. We can see an entire country from a single family." The female artist strives to express the entire nation's survival culture and the philosophical significance of life in modern life through her works, thus opening up a spiritual space for people.

In the Miao Mountains and Dong villages, in the valleys and plains, in all these places shrouded in the mysterious colors of Eastern culture, Wang Ping's nature, passion, and hope have found a foothold. She draws nourishment from traditional folk art and, with the thinking, rhythm, and speed of a modern person, surpasses tradition, confidently stepping into a new realm.

Wang Ping is a courageous and enterprising woman.

　　王平和她的艺术
    本报记者  孟晓云
    王平是一个单纯而深刻的女性。
    两年前，３２岁的王平，带着她的上百个陶雕、木雕，在中国美术馆举办了个展，以浓烈的民间、民族特色和现代艺术气息引起美术界的关注。明天，她又将带着３０件金属雕塑及５０幅版画，再次走进中国美术馆中央大厅。
    王平从衣着、表情都透出一种贵州高原的淳朴、明净，她谈起对艺术的种种感受时，那些深刻的思索着实让人吃惊。
    “我以为画展的真正成功，是在展厅里表现出来的一种精神状态，它对于观众既熟悉又陌生。熟悉是因为它具有这个文化圈子里的语言，陌生是大家不知道这种精神状态的存在就是自己这种文化发生的事，他们从中感受到神秘又感受到亲切。”
    和王平接触，你会被她咄咄逼人的气势所感染。她常有发人奇想的想象和无拘无束的率真。她不是凭理念，而是凭生命的直感、想象进行创作的，只要感受到、想象到，她的手就做到。不论具象、变形、抽象，她能妥善地把它们结合为一个整体。这或许是因为王平从没有进过艺术院校，也没有进行过正规训练，使她用不着以正规的一套来规范自己，束缚自己，而是顺乎天性地发展了自己独特的艺术个性——沿着变形、抽象、综合构成这一轨迹开拓。面对王平的作品，就像面对着原始的生命，它们质朴，无拘无束，要喜则喜，要怒则怒。
    王平练过国画、版画、油画，但她认为，搞雕塑最为痛快，可以用真刀、真斧砍出一个活人。而王平从事艺术的目的就是要了解人，发现人，创造人，启发人。艺术首先是为了人。
    这次展出的青铜雕《华表之二》，是一个母亲的形象。跪在地上干瘪而衰老的母亲竭力顶着她的几十个孩子，变形的造型呈华表状。王平对我说：“中国人的观念，子女由父母养起来，从小到老，母亲很穷，负担极重，孩子们只知道抱怨，但谁也不为自己的母亲着想。我们从一个家庭可以看到一个国家”。女艺术家在她的作品中极力表现整个民族的生存文化和现代生活中的生命的哲学意义，因此，她的作品为人们开拓了一种精神空间。
    在苗岭、侗寨，在山坳、平川，在这一切笼罩着东方神秘色彩的民族文化沃土中，王平的秉性、热情、希望都有了落脚之处。她在传统的民间艺术中汲取营养，又以现代人的思维、律动和速度超越了传统，充满自信地走向一个新的境界。
    王平是勇于进取的女性。
