Two British journalists who entered Lhasa as tourists but conducted reporting activities were ordered to leave Tibet within 24 hours tonight by relevant departments of the Tibet Autonomous Region.

Guy Dinmore of Reuters in Beijing and Jasper Becker of the British Guardian, entered Lhasa as tourists without the approval of the Tibet Autonomous Region's Foreign Affairs Office for their reporting activities. On March 6, they took photographs and conducted interviews at the scene of disturbances caused by a few rioters, in violation of Articles 16 and 17 of the "Guidelines for Foreign Journalists in China" issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Article 3 of the No. 3 Notice issued by the Lhasa Municipal Government in 1987, which states that "foreigners are not allowed to gather and take photographs of disturbances instigated by a few splittist elements." They also obstructed the Tibet Foreign Affairs Police in the performance of their duties.

The Foreign Affairs Section of the Public Security Bureau of the Tibet Autonomous Region, in accordance with Article 19, Paragraph 7 of the "Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security," imposed fines and verbal warnings on Dinmore and Becker, respectively, and ordered the two journalists to leave Tibet within 24 hours.

　　违反我国规定　妨碍民警公务
    两英国记者被责令离藏
    新华社拉萨３月８日电  （记者王浩）以旅游者的身份在拉萨从事采访活动的两名英国记者今晚被西藏自治区有关部门责令限时离开西藏。
    英国路透社驻北京记者丁凯（ＧＵＹ　ＤＩＮＭＯＲＥ）和英国《卫报》驻北京记者白克尔（ＪＡＳＰＥＲ　ＢＥＣＫＥＲ），在西藏自治区外事办公室未同意他们来西藏采访的情况下，最近以旅游者身份来到拉萨。他们于本月６日擅自在少数骚乱分子制造的骚乱现场拍照、采访，违反了外交部制定的《外国驻华记者须知》第１６、１７条规定和拉萨市人民政府１９８７年第３号通告第３条“外国人不得围观、拍摄少数分裂分子操纵的闹事活动”的规定，并妨碍了西藏外事民警执行公务。
    西藏自治区公安厅外管处依照《中华人民共和国治安管理处罚条例》第１９条第７款规定，分别对丁凯和白克尔给予罚款和口头警告，责令这两名记者在２４小时内离开西藏。
