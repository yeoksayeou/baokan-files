Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 4th.

The State Council Safety Committee recently forwarded the Ministry of Communications' "Notice on the Major Accident of a Boat Capsizing at the Anping Township Ferry in Tongling County, Anhui Province," requiring all regions to strengthen the management of township vessels.

According to the Ministry of Communications' "Notice," at 4 PM on January 11, Hu Xinghua, who had contracted the Hu Family Ferry at Anping Township, Ye Family Village in Tongling County, Anhui Province, illegally handed over the boat to his son, Hu Shuqing, who did not know how to drive it. The boat, which could only carry 17 people, was loaded with 27. When the boat was 200 meters out into the river, it began to sink. Hu Shuqing then mistakenly stopped the engine, accelerating the sinking of the ferry. All passengers fell into the water, resulting in 19 deaths.

In response, the State Council Safety Committee and the Ministry of Communications require all regions to:

1. Further implement the responsibility of county and township (town) governments in managing township ferries. All ferry points must register with the maritime supervision authorities to obtain a "Ship Inspection Certificate," "Ship Crew (Ferry Worker) Certificate," and define the "Ship Name Plate" and "Load Line." They must also register with the industrial and commercial administration to obtain a "Business License." Otherwise, they are not permitted to engage in ferry services.

2. Ferry point ferry contracts must implement a safety responsibility system and cannot be managed by contracting out and leaving it to chance.

3. Effectively implement the management of township vessel managers and provide them with business and technical training and guidance.

4. Strengthen the supervision and management of ferry point safety.

　　国家安委会交通部要求各地
    加强对乡镇船舶管理
    新华社北京３月４日电  国家安全生产委员会近日转发了交通部《关于安徽省铜陵县安平乡渡口发生翻船重大事故的通报》，要求各地加强对乡镇船舶的管理。
    据交通部的《通报》介绍，元月１１日下午四时，承包安徽铜陵安平乡叶家村胡家渡口的胡兴华，擅自将船交给不懂驾驶的小儿子胡树青独自渡运，只能坐１７人的船却坐了２７人，当船行至２００米宽的江中时，船体下沉。而胡树青又错误停机，加速了渡船的沉没，人员全部落水，死亡１９人。
    为此，国家安全生产委员会、交通部要求各地：
    一是要进一步落实县、乡（镇）政府管理乡镇客渡的责任。各渡口必须到港航监督机关办理“船舶检验证书”、“船员（渡工）证书”，标定“船名牌”、勘划“载重线”，并要到工商部门办理“营业执照”，否则不得从事客渡运。
    二是渡口渡船承包，一定要落实安全责任制，不能以包代管，放任自流。
    三是切实做好乡镇船舶管理员的落实工作，并给予业务技术培训和指导。
    四是加强对渡口安全的监督管理。
