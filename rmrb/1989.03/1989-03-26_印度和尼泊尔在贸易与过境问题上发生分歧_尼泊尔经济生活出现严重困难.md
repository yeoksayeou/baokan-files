Recently, Nepal has seen a wave of "panic buying" across the country. People are rushing to buy kerosene, cooking oil, and salt, and long queues of cars are waiting to refuel. Some customers have even clashed with shop owners, suspecting that merchants are selling goods to restaurants and eateries at higher prices for profit. Police have set up checkpoints at oil product sales stores and markets to maintain order and prevent chaos.

According to reports, the reason for the panic buying in Nepal is that India notified the Nepalese government on March 1 that it would stop supplying edible oil, salt, and petroleum products to Nepal by the end of the month.

Nepal is a landlocked country that does not produce oil, and only produces a small amount of coal and salt. It relies entirely or mainly on imports from India or third countries via India for its oil, coal, and salt. In the past, India provided Nepal with 160,000 tons of coal, 165,000 tons of salt, and approximately 250,000 tons of petroleum products annually.

Observers here believe that India's halt on supplying oil and coal to Nepal will paralyze many of Nepal's industries. It is estimated that within a month, all means of transportation in Nepal will be unable to operate due to a lack of fuel.

India's reason for stopping the supply of these essential items to Nepal is that the trade and transit agreements between the two countries expired on March 23 and March 26, respectively. Due to differing opinions, the two sides have not reached a consensus on signing new agreements. Therefore, in the absence of new agreements and with the old ones expired, the Indian government unilaterally announced the termination of the trade and border agreements between the two countries on March 23, stopping the supply of essential items to Nepal. This action has caused Nepal to lose its "preferential treatment" status in India.

The direct reason for the failure of the Nepalese and Indian governments to reach an agreement on the new agreements is that India insists on combining the two agreements into one, while Nepal believes that trade is a phased, bilateral matter. As a landlocked country, its transit trade is not only long-term but also involves third countries, so two agreements should be signed. According to informed sources, there are also other indirect reasons, one of which is India's dissatisfaction with some actions of the Nepalese government.

In 1987, the Nepalese government issued a regulation that all foreigners residing in Nepal must obtain a work permit issued by the country to work in Nepal. According to reports, India considers this an "unfriendly act" and accuses Nepal of violating the spirit of the "Peace and Friendship Treaty" between the two countries.

According to the 1950 "Peace and Friendship Treaty" signed by the two countries, citizens of both countries can freely enter each other's territories without visas, and both sides' citizens have the privilege of engaging in trade and commerce in each other's territories. As a result, a large number of Indians have flocked to Nepal, causing some difficulties for Nepal's social and economic stability. However, India believes that the regulation on issuing work permits to foreigners restricts Indians' work in Nepal.

On March 17 and 18, Nepal and India successively announced the failure of their negotiations on renegotiating the trade and transit agreements. Nepal immediately experienced a wave of panic buying, severely affecting Nepal's economic development and social stability. Currently, the Nepalese government, based on relevant international regulations that landlocked countries should enjoy transit freedom, is actively seeking to reach an agreement with the Indian government to ensure normal trade exchanges and maintain traditional friendship between the two peoples.

　　印度和尼泊尔在贸易与过境问题上发生分歧        
    尼泊尔经济生活出现严重困难
    新华社记者  李英  肖成林
    最近，尼泊尔全国各地都出现了“抢购风”，人们争先恐后地抢购煤油、食油和食盐，汽车也排长队等着加油，一些顾客甚至同商店老板发生了冲突，因为他们怀疑商贩们为了牟取暴利而把货物卖给出价更高的饭店和餐馆。警察还在出售石油产品的商店和市场上设立了岗哨，维持秩序，防止混乱。
    据报道，尼泊尔出现抢购风的原因是因为印度３月１日通告尼泊尔政府，它将于本月底停止向尼泊尔供应食用油、食盐和石油产品。
    尼泊尔是个内陆国家，它不生产石油，只生产极少量的煤和食盐。其所需石油、煤和食盐全部或主要靠从印度进口或通过印度从第三国进口。过去，印度每年向尼泊尔提供１６万吨煤，１６．５万吨食盐和２５万吨左右的石油产品。
    此间观察家们认为，印度停止向尼泊尔供应石油和煤将使尼泊尔许多工业陷入瘫痪，而且估计不到一个月，尼泊尔国内的所有交通工具将因缺乏燃料而不能行驶。
    印度宣布停止向尼泊尔供应上述必需产品的理由是两国签署的贸易条约和过境条约分别于３月２３日和３月２６日期满。双方则因意见分歧，未能就签订新条约达成一致，因此，在旧条约期满，新条约没有签订的情况下，印度政府单方面宣布两国贸易条约和边境条约在３月２３日终止，停止向尼泊尔供应必需品，从而使尼泊尔丧失了它在印度的“特惠国待遇”。
    尼印两国政府未能就新条约问题达成一致意见的直接原因是印度坚持将两个条约统一为一个条约，而尼泊尔则认为贸易是阶段性的、双边的，而作为内陆国，它的过境贸易不仅是长期性的，而且还涉及第三国，因此应签署两个条约。据消息灵通人士说，还有其他间接原因，其中之一是印度对尼泊尔政府的一些做法不满。
    尼泊尔政府于１９８７年颁布了所有居住在尼泊尔的外国人必须持该国颁发的工作许可证方能在尼泊尔工作的规定。据报道，印度认为这是对印度的“不友好行为”，指责尼泊尔的这种做法违背了两国的“和平友好条约”精神。
    根据两国１９５０年签定的《和平友好条约》，两国公民可以自由进入对方领土，无须办理签证，双方公民有在对方国土上从事贸易和商业等特权。这样，大批印度人纷纷涌进尼泊尔，给尼泊尔的社会和经济稳定造成了一定困难。而印度认为，关于发放外国人工作许可证的规定限制了印度人在尼泊尔的工作。
    尼泊尔和印度于３月１７日和１８日先后公布双方在重新签订贸易条约、过境条约问题上交涉失败，尼泊尔全国随即刮起了抢购风，给尼泊尔经济发展和社会稳定造成严重影响。目前，尼泊尔政府根据国际上有关内陆国应享有过境自由权的有关规定，正在积极努力，寻求同印度政府达成一致意见，保证正常的贸易往来，维护两国人民的传统友谊。
