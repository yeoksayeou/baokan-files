For many years, experts have believed that people who are constantly in a state of tension, known in medical terms as "Type A behavior," are more likely to develop heart disease. However, the latest research indicates that mistrusting others and being easily irritated, angry, or prone to outbursts is more dangerous.

At a recent meeting of the American Heart Association, Dr. Williams of Duke University Medical Center pointed out that constantly working hard, being in a state of tension, and disturbing others does not necessarily harm the heart. What is harmful is having a strong sense of hostility when dealing with people, being easily angered, and not being good at controlling oneself. He believes that people should focus on studying the harm that anger does to the heart.

In a study led by Dr. Williams, 118 students underwent personality tests and were tracked over a 25-year period. In the group with the strongest sense of hostility, 20% had died, while in the group with the weakest sense of hostility, only 5% had died. This result shows that people who are suspicious and do not trust others are at a higher risk of heart disease. They are easily angered, often complain, and show their displeasure with a long face. According to a survey, about 20% of the American population has this problem.

Currently, there is a theory that the adrenaline produced by the sympathetic nervous system directly affects a person's emotions, while the parasympathetic nervous system can neutralize adrenaline. People who are easily angered have a parasympathetic nervous system that responds slowly. On the other hand, people who are not easily angered have a parasympathetic nervous system that acts as a protective mechanism when the sympathetic nervous system, which produces adrenaline, is active.

### 发怒易患心脏病

　　发怒易患心脏病
    多少年来，有关专家认为，总是处于紧张状态的人，即医学上所谓的“Ａ型行为”者容易得心脏病。但是，最新的研究表明，对人不信任，容易急躁、生气、发脾气才是致命的。
    在前不久举行的美国“心脏协会”的一次会议上，杜克大学医学中心的威廉斯博士指出，总是卖力工作、总是处于紧张状态、喜欢打扰别人，对人的心脏不一定有害。有害的是与人打交道时，敌对意识太强，容易生气，又不善于克制。他认为，人们应集中精力来研究生气对于心脏的危害。
    威廉斯博士主持的一项研究中，对１１８名学生进行了性格测试跟踪，２５年后，在敌对意识最强的一组人中，有２０％已死亡，而在敌对意识最弱的一组中，死亡者仅占５％。这一结果表明，好猜忌、对别人不信任的人，得心脏病的风险较大。他们容易发怒，总是抱怨，并拉长脸显示自己的不愉快。据调查，美国人口中，大约有２０％的人存在此类问题。
    目前，有一种理论认为，人的交感神经系统产生的肾上腺素直接影响人的情绪，但副交感神经系统则可以中和肾上腺素。容易发脾气的人，副交感神经起作用总是很慢。不易发怒的人则不同，当产生肾上腺素的交感神经系统作祟时，他们的副交感神经系统会起到保护作用。
