The title of "Art Master" will no longer be just a colloquial honor bestowed by the public on artists; it will also be a national recognition. This year, during the National Day celebrations and the second China Art Festival, the Ministry of Culture will confer the honorary title of "Art Master" on a group of artists.

The Ministry of Culture has proposed that the selection criteria for Art Masters should be artists who, in fields such as fine arts, music, drama, opera, dance, puppetry, shadow play, and acrobatics, have made significant contributions to China's art industry through creative work. Their achievements should represent the highest level of Chinese national art and enjoy high prestige both domestically and internationally. Additionally, they should be at least 65 years old. To ensure the lifelong and representative nature of the "Art Master" honor, the first selection will be limited to 50 people.

The Ministry of Culture will establish a selection committee chaired by Minister Wang Meng, with renowned figures from the literary and artistic circles participating. The selection of Art Masters will be done through anonymous voting by the committee members.

It is understood that the Art Master selection activity will be held every two years in the future.

　　艺术大师桂冠谁属
    文化部年内评选揭晓
    新华社北京３月３日电  （记者邵建武）“艺术大师”将不再仅仅是民间对艺术家的尊称，而且也是国家对艺术家的肯定，今年国庆节和第二届中国艺术节期间，文化部将授予一批艺术家以“艺术大师”荣誉称号。
    文化部提出的评选原则是，艺术大师应该是在美术、音乐、戏剧、戏曲、舞蹈、木偶、皮影、杂技等艺术领域，以创造性的劳动，为我国艺术事业作出了重大贡献的艺术家，他们的成就代表了中华民族艺术的最高水平，在国内外享有崇高声望，年龄在６５岁以上。为了体现“艺术大师”荣誉称号的终生性和代表性，首次评选将限定在５０人以内。
    文化部将组成由部长王蒙为主任委员、有文艺界知名人士参加的评选委员会。艺术大师人选由评委会以无记名投票方式产生。
    据悉，艺术大师的评选活动今后将每两年举行一次。
