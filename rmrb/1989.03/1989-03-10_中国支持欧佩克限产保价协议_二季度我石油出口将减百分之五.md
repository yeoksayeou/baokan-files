China will reduce its oil exports by 5 percent in the second quarter of this year to support the OPEC production cut agreement.

The state has designated the China National Chemical Import and Export Corporation to handle all oil import and export business. The corporation's general manager, Zheng Dunxin, recently told a reporter from this news agency that the plan is to reduce oil exports by 5 percent in the second quarter of this year.

He said that after the 84th ministerial meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reached an agreement on production quotas for the first half of 1989, we noted that OPEC's production had significantly decreased in January and February. The continuous decline in international oil prices has been reversed. To cooperate with OPEC in stabilizing the global oil market and gradually restoring the price of crude oil to $18 per barrel, we have made the above decision.

　　中国支持欧佩克限产保价协议
    二季度我石油出口将减百分之五
    新华社北京３月９日电  中国今年二季度将减少５％的石油出口量，以支持欧佩克限产保价协议。
    国家指定中国化工进出口总公司统一经营石油进出口业务，这个公司的总经理郑敦训日前向本社记者透露，拟在今年第二季度减少石油出口５％。
    他说，石油输出国组织第８４届部长级会议就１９８９年上半年的产量配额等问题达成协议之后，我们注意到今年１—２月份欧佩克的产量有了较大幅度减少，国际石油价格持续下跌的局面有所扭转。为了配合欧佩克稳定世界石油市场，逐步恢复每桶原油１８美元所做的努力，我们做出了上述决定。
