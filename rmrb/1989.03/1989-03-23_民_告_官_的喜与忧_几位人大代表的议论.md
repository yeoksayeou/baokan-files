The past year has seen a noticeable increase in the phenomenon of "citizens suing officials" across various regions. Is this a good thing? Is it a cause for concern? Let's hear what a few People's Congress representatives have to say.

	Yu Guoqing: The Government Must Also Abide by the Law

Last year, in January, a news item from Benxi City, Liaoning Province, made headlines: Coal mine owner Ren Guangfu, dissatisfied with the administrative penalty decision by the city government, sued the government in the district people's court. The city government's legal representative, Mayor Yu Guoqing, upon receiving the court notice, immediately appointed a legal representative to appear in court. In court, both sides engaged in a heated debate, each presenting their arguments. Ultimately, the district court ruled to overturn the city government's administrative penalty decision.

Discussing this case, the 52-year-old Yu Guoqing sincerely said, "Although the city government did not win the lawsuit, the fact that the public dares to sue the government in court is itself a cause for celebration. He believes that government officials and ordinary citizens participating in litigation activities on an equal footing, and the court handling the case fairly and impartially, are all results of recent efforts to popularize legal knowledge and promote democratic politics.

	Guan Chunlan, Zhao Jinduo: Appearing in Court Does Not Lower Authority

Last spring, a Hui woman from Baoding City, Hebei Province, dissatisfied with a city government ruling, filed a lawsuit in court, bringing Mayor Zhu Zhenshan to the defendant's seat.

Guan Chunlan, vice chairperson of the Baoding City People's Congress Standing Committee, mentioned this incident and said, "After the court's review, it was found that the city government's ruling was clear and the procedure was legal, so it should be upheld. Now, Zhu Zhenshan is still the mayor, and his authority remains high."

Zhao Jinduo, executive vice governor of Cangzhou Region, said, "To achieve the rule of law, it is necessary to enact laws allowing 'citizens to sue officials.' This can make the government and its staff better accept supervision, increase political transparency, and also enhance citizens' legal awareness."

	Sun Wenzhong: Hope the Administrative Litigation Law is Enacted Soon

Sun Wenzhong, director of the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, said, "Citizens suing officials shows that the public knows how to use the law to protect their legal rights. Government leaders standing in the defendant's seat is itself a manifestation of strengthened legal awareness. Now, our country has over 130 laws and administrative regulations that stipulate 'citizens can sue the government' in court. To enable the courts to handle administrative cases in a timely manner according to legal procedures, it is very necessary to expedite the formulation of a unified national administrative litigation law. I hope the administrative litigation law, which is soon to be reviewed, will be enacted and implemented as soon as possible."

　　“民”告“官”的喜与忧        
    ——几位人大代表的议论
    本报记者  潘岗  袁建达
    过去的一年，各地“民”告“官”现象明显增多。是喜？是忧？请看几位人大代表的议论。
    　　　　于国磬说：政府也得守法
    去年年初，辽宁本溪市爆出一条新闻：个人煤矿业主任广福不服市政府行政处罚决定，到区人民法院状告市政府。市政府法人代表——市长于国磬接到法庭通知，立即委托诉讼代理人出庭应诉。法庭上双方唇枪舌剑，据理力争。最后区法院作出终审裁定：撤销市政府行政处罚决定。
    谈到这个例子，五十二岁的于国磬诚恳地说，虽然市政府没有胜诉，但群众敢于依法同政府打官司，这本身就是值得高兴的事。他认为，政府官员与普通群众平等地参加诉讼活动，法院依法公正审理，都是近年来普及法律常识，推进民主政治的结果。
    　　　　关春兰、赵金铎说：上法庭不等于降低威信
    前年初春，河北省泊头市一回族妇女，因不服市政府一项裁决，依法向法院提起诉讼，将泊头市市长朱振山推上被告席。
    泊头市人大常委会副主任关春兰谈及此事时说，法院经过审理认为，市政府裁定事实清楚，程序合法，应予维持。现在，朱振山照样是市长，威信还是蛮高的。
    沧州地区行署专员赵金铎说，实现依法治国，颁布“民”告“官”法律是非常必要的，它可使政府及其工作人员更好地接受监督，增加政治民主透明度，也可增强公民的法制意识。
    　　　　孙琬钟说：希望行政诉讼法尽早颁布
    国务院法制局局长孙琬钟说，民告官，说明群众知道用法律保护自己的合法权益了。政府首长能站上被告席，本身就是法制观念增强的表现。现在，我国已有一百三十多个法律、行政法规作出了“老百姓”可以到法院“告政府”的规定。为了使法院能按法定程序及时处理好行政案件，十分必要抓紧制定一部全国统一适用的行政诉讼法。希望即将审议的行政诉讼法早日颁布施行。
