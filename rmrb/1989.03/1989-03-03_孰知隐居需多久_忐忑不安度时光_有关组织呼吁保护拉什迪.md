Xinhua News Agency, London, March 2nd.

Who knows how long one must hide? Anxiously passing the time. Organizations call for the protection of Rushdie.

According to a report by the British newspaper *The Times* on March 2nd, the author of *The Satanic Verses*, Salman Rushdie, said on March 2nd from his hiding place that he does not know how much longer he will need to stay hidden.

The report states that Rushdie told the editor of Viking Publishers, which published *The Satanic Verses*, that he has no fixed plans and feels well.

The report quotes an unnamed manager of Viking Publishers as saying, “(Rushdie) said he often feels anxious and does not know how long he will have to stay in his current hiding place.”

Since the Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for Rushdie's death, Rushdie has been under the protection of British police, and no one knows his current address.

According to the report, more than 1,000 renowned writers, publishers, and booksellers from around the world, who are members of the committee to defend Rushdie and his publishers, issued a joint statement to the world on March 2nd, calling on governments to reject Iran's threats against Rushdie. The statement says that Khomeini's death sentence violates the *International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights*, of which Iran is a signatory.

    孰知隐居需多久　忐忑不安度时光
    有关组织呼吁保护拉什迪
    新华社伦敦3月2日电  据英国《泰晤士报》2日报道，《撒旦诗篇》的作者拉什迪2日在他的隐蔽处说，他不知道还要隐藏多久。
    报道说，拉什迪对出版《撒旦诗篇》的瓦伊金出版社主编说，他没有固定的计划，他感觉良好。
    报道援引不愿透露姓名的瓦伊金出版社经理的话说：“（拉什迪）说他时常感到忐忑不安，也不知在他目前的隐蔽处还要呆多久。”
    自从伊朗宗教领袖霍梅尼宣布要处死拉什迪以来，拉什迪一直处于英国警方的保护之下，无人知道他目前的住址。
    据报道，保卫拉什迪及其出版商国际委员会的1000余名世界著名的作家、出版商和零售商2日联名向全世界发表一份声明，呼吁各国政府拒绝伊朗对拉什迪的威胁。声明说，霍梅尼死刑令违犯了《关于民权和政治权利的国际公约》，而伊朗是这一公约的签字国。
