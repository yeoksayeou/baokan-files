Edition: 6

Chentangang is the sole water source for the residents and production activities of Jinfeng Town and the surrounding six townships in Longle County, Fujian Province. Since 1984, Jinfeng Town has established 299 enterprises, including ramie, paper, towels, leather, synthetic fibers, machinery, and dyeing industries. These enterprises discharge 342,000 tons of industrial wastewater into Chentangang annually, leading to severe water pollution. The Jinfeng Town water plant often has to halt water supply, making it extremely difficult for residents to access drinking water. The pollution of Chentangang has also resulted in reduced crop yields and the poisoning and death of numerous poultry and livestock. We urge relevant departments to urgently address the pollution in Chentangang.

　　尽快整治长乐陈塘港污染
    陈塘港是我省长乐县金峰镇及周围６个乡镇居民生活和生产用水的唯一水源。１９８４年以来，金峰镇先后兴建了苎麻、造纸、毛巾、制革、合成纤维、机械加工、漂染等２９９家企业。这些企业每年向陈塘港排放工业废水达３４２万吨，致使陈塘港水源严重污染，金峰镇自来水厂经常被迫停止供水，居民饮水非常困难。陈塘港水源污染还使农作物减产，大批禽畜中毒死亡。呼吁有关部门尽快整治陈塘港。
