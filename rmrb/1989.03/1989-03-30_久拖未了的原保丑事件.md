The Long-Delayed Case of Yuan Baochou

In April 1988, during the first session of the National People's Congress in Beijing, NPC delegate and lawyer Jin Hui spoke about the issue of the Long Treatment Automobile Transport Company in Shanxi Province's Changzhi City violating state regulations to seize collective enterprises and dismiss the manager of the collective enterprise, Yuan Baochou. Nearly a year has passed since then, what is the current situation?

In September 1979, the Long Treatment Company established the Long Treatment Labor Service Company to arrange jobs for unemployed youth within the company. Under the leadership of Yuan Baochou (who served as deputy manager and later as manager), the company gradually developed and grew stronger. In 1984, Yuan Baochou was named a labor model of Changzhi City, and the Labor Service Company was twice named an advanced collective for arranging jobs for unemployed youth and developing the collective economy at the provincial and municipal levels.

During this period, the Long Treatment Company adjusted its leadership team, and Wang Maoyao became the manager. After Wang took office, some unpleasant incidents occurred between him and Yuan Baochou. First, Wang Maoyao wanted to take back a factory that had been supporting the Labor Service Company, and Yuan Baochou reported this. Second, Wang Maoyao wanted to buy a car for his brother to engage in individual transportation, and in January 1985, he personally borrowed 260,000 yuan from Yuan Baochou, which Yuan Baochou did not agree to.

In January 1987, Long Treatment decided to adjust a batch of mid-level cadres, and Yuan Baochou was internally designated to be transferred to the Automobile 5th Team as the team leader. According to the regulations of the Changzhi City Government, the transfer of the manager of the Labor Service Company should be approved by the Municipal Labor Service Company in advance. Long Treatment went to the Municipal Labor Service Company to seek opinions, but the Municipal Service Company did not agree to the transfer. However, Long Treatment insisted on the transfer and appointed Wang Lirwen, the deputy manager of Long Treatment, to concurrently serve as the manager of the Labor Service Company. Due to the opposition of the vast majority of the employees of the Labor Service Company to this appointment order, Yuan Baochou also did not go to the 5th Team to take up his post. Long Treatment then requested support from the Provincial Transport Company. On January 17, the Provincial Transportation Department and the Provincial Transport Company jointly sent a telegram: "Comrade Yuan Baochou and all employees of the Labor Service Company... shall not use any excuse to interfere with the reform of the enterprise leadership system..." Long Treatment conveyed this telegram to the employees, and in some party member study sessions, they also criticized Yuan Baochou. This further intensified the conflict. Therefore, on January 20, the party secretary of the Provincial Transport Company, Huo Qingling, and the disciplinary inspection secretary, Li Mingjian, came to Long Treatment. After listening to various opinions, they decided that Yuan Baochou would not go to the 5th Team but would return to work at the Labor Service Company. This eased the conflict. However, for unknown reasons, the Provincial Transport Company suddenly changed its mind three months later. On April 23, the leaders of Long Treatment and the Provincial Transport work team held a joint meeting. Without going through the proper procedures, they removed Yuan Baochou from his position as team leader of the 5th Team and stopped paying his salary. At the same time, they decided to abolish the four official seals of the original Labor Service Company, use new seals, freeze the bank account, change the legal representative, and decided to send a work team to the Labor Service Company the next day to assist the new leadership in their work.

The manager of the Provincial Transport Company, Ren Shoulong, also said at the meeting: "We need to send some strong men in, and once they go in, they will make him retreat."

The employees of the Labor Service Company, who had heard about this, also took some measures to resist. They convened a general meeting of employees according to relevant regulations and democratically elected a manager. Of the 131 people present, Yuan Baochou was elected manager with 124 votes in favor and 7 abstentions. On the day the work team arrived, some employees also locked the doors and closed the windows in advance. Therefore, when the 15-member work team entered the service company's location at the Transportation Building on April 24, they could not open the door and had to force it open, smash the windows, cut the power lines, and seal the cars.

After the incident, the Shanxi Provincial Labor Bureau and the Provincial Labor Service Company formed an investigation team, clarified all the facts, and wrote an investigation report. Soon, the Provincial Transportation Department also sent an investigation team to Changzhi, and the investigation results were basically the same. However, strangely, this matter became like a stone sinking into the sea.

By April 1988, Wang Senhao, the governor of Shanxi Province, learned of the situation and was very angry, pointing out that this was an illegal and disorderly behavior, and expressed the need to remove interference and handle the matter seriously. Subsequently, under the direct intervention of the Shanxi Provincial Committee, a joint investigation team was formed by the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission supervising the Provincial Transportation Department, Changzhi City, and the Provincial Labor Service Company. From May 11 to July 10, they conducted an in-depth investigation and wrote an investigation report. In the report to the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, it was proposed to handle Yuan Baochou's work "in accordance with the principle of seeking truth from facts and giving full play to his strengths." The Party Group of the Provincial Transportation Department also stated that "in accordance with the suggestions of the investigation report and the opinions of the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, the work arrangement for Yuan Baochou should be promptly and properly handled." The Provincial Labor Service Company "suggested restoring Comrade Yuan Baochou to his position as manager of the Labor Service Company," and the relevant leaders of the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government made instructions. However, from then until now, half a year has passed, and the issue of restoring Yuan Baochou's position remains "as elusive as the Yellow Crane."

### 久拖未了的原保丑事件

　　久拖未了的原保丑事件
    １９８８年４月，全国人大第一次会议在京召开期间，人大代表、律师晋辉，就山西省长治市汽车运输公司违反国家有关规定，强占集体企业，罢免集体企业经理原保丑的问题作了发言。如今已事隔近一年，情况如何呢？
    １９７９年９月，长运公司为安置本公司待业青年，成立了长运劳动服务公司，在原保丑（先为副经理、后为经理）的带领下，逐步发展壮大。１９８４年，原保丑被评为长治市劳动模范，劳动服务公司也两次被评为省、市安置待业青年和发展集体经济的先进集体。
    在此期间，长运公司调整了领导班子，王茂尧担任了经理。王任经理后，与原保丑发生了些不愉快的事。一是王茂尧要收回支援劳动服务公司的一个工厂，原保丑告了状。二是王茂尧为给其弟买汽车搞个体运输，１９８５年１月当面向原保丑借款２．６万元，原没有同意。
    １９８７年１月，长运决定调整一批中层干部，原保丑被内定调汽车５队任队长。按长治市政府规定，调劳动服务公司经理应事先征得市劳动服务公司的同意，长运到市劳动服务公司征求意见，市服务公司不同意调动。但长运公司坚持要调，并任命长运公司副经理王立文兼任劳动服务公司经理。由于劳动服务公司的绝大多数职工反对这项任免令，原保丑也不到５队赴任。长运公司便要求省运输公司支持。１月１７日，省交通厅、省运输公司联名打来电报：要求“原保丑同志及劳动服务公司全体职工，……不得以任何借口干扰企业领导体制改革……”，长运公司把这份电报向职工做了传达，在部分党员学习会上，还就原保丑问题进行了批判。这样一来，使得矛盾更趋尖锐和激化。因此，１月２０日，省运公司党委书记霍庆玲、纪检书记李明鉴等来到长运，在听取了各方面的意见后，决定原保丑不去５队，仍回劳动服务公司工作。从而使得矛盾趋于缓和。但不知什么原因，在时隔３个月之后，省运公司突然改变了主意。４月２３日，长运领导及省运工作组召开联席会议，在未履行手续的情况下，免去原保丑５队队长职务，停发了工资。同时决定废除原劳动服务公司４枚公章，启用新章，冻结银行帐号，更换法人代表，并决定第二天派工作组进驻劳动服务公司协助新班子开展工作。
    省运公司经理任守龙还在会上说：“要派一些彪形大汉去，这些人一进去，就使他退却”。
    早有耳闻的劳动服务公司职工，也采取了些抵制措施。他们根据有关文件规定，召开职工大会民主选举经理。到会１３１人，原保丑以１２４票赞成、７票弃权当选为经理。在工作组进驻的那天，一些职工还事先锁了门、关了窗。所以，当４月２４日由１5人组成的工作组进到服务公司所在地交通大厦时，门打不开，就强行撬门、砸玻璃，切断电线、封存汽车。
    事情发生后，山西省劳动局和省劳动服务公司组成调查组，弄清了全部事实，写出了调查报告。不久，省交通厅又派调查组到长治，调查结果基本相同。但奇怪的是这件事如石沉海底。
    转眼到了１９８８年４月，参加人代会的山西省省长王森浩了解到情况后很生气，指出这是违法乱纪行为，并表示要排除干扰，认真处理。此后，在山西省委的直接干预下，由省纪委监督组织省交通厅、长治市和省劳动服务公司派员组成联合调查组，从５月１１日—７月１０日又深入地调查，写出了调查报告。在省纪委向省委的报告中，提出对原保丑的工作，“本着实事求是、发挥专长的原则，妥善处理”。省交通厅党组也表示对原保丑的工作安排，“根据调查报告的建议和省纪委的意见，尽快妥善安排”。省劳动服务公司“建议恢复原保丑同志劳动服务公司经理职务”，省委及省政府有关领导都作了批示。然而，从那时到现在又半个年头了，原保丑恢复职务的问题仍然“渺如黄鹤”。
