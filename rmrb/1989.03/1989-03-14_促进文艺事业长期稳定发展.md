In the new situation where China's socialist modernization and reform and opening up are deepening, and the arts face challenges and tests from the times, the Communist Party of China Central Committee issued the "Several Opinions on Further Prospering the Arts." This is a major event in China's arts field. Studying and implementing this document conscientiously is an important guarantee for promoting the long-term stable development of China's socialist arts.

This document was drafted by relevant leading departments of the CPC Central Committee after soliciting opinions from cadres and workers in the arts at various levels, and was discussed and adopted by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. The document seriously summarizes the experiences and lessons of the Party in leading the arts, explores and studies the guiding ideology and methods for leading the arts work under new historical conditions, and has important guiding significance for improving and strengthening the Party's leadership over the arts.

For a long time, the Party has had some successful experiences in leading the arts, but also many mistakes, even painful lessons. Insisting on taking class struggle as the key link and having a narrow understanding of the functions of the arts, has seriously restricted and injured the productive forces of the arts, obstructing the normal and healthy development of the arts. During the ten years of turmoil, the literary and artistic circles were desolate. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Party rectified the wrongs, respected the laws of artistic creation, made major adjustments to the arts policies, and greatly liberated the minds of the broad masses of arts workers, giving them great freedom in creation. China's arts have undergone historic major changes. Although there were also some unhealthy tendencies in the development of arts work in these ten years, the Party's leadership over the arts has indeed become more mature. The document clearly points out that the Party's leadership over the arts is leadership in political principles and direction, is to formulate and adjust arts policies, do ideological and political work, and ensure that the arts develop in the correct direction; the leading organs of the Party should fully respect the characteristics and laws of the arts, and intervene less in specific arts works and academic issues; leaders should correctly implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, and strive to explore and study the ways and methods of leading the arts under new historical conditions, etc. These are very precious summaries of experience, and are crucial for ensuring the long-term stable development of China's arts.

The document proposes that under new historical conditions, we should still adhere to the direction of "serving the people and serving socialism" for the arts, adhere to the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," and clearly put forward that "our arts should hold high the banner of patriotism and socialism, advocate socialist humanism, and strive unremittingly for the four modernizations and the rejuvenation of China." Arts workers, as a special group of spiritual laborers, have full freedom in what to write and how to write. The Party no longer requires the arts to be subordinate to politics, nor does it require them to be subordinate to temporary, specific, and direct political tasks. For arts workers, there is the issue of correctly understanding the social significance of the arts and clarifying their social responsibilities. We should inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of China's revolutionary arts, fully play the various functions of the arts, and create more excellent works that are conducive to socialist modernization and comprehensive reform, that are conducive to inspiring people to strive for progress, innovate, and take the initiative, and that are conducive to cultivating people's moral sentiments. This will enhance the nation's self-confidence, strengthen the nation's cohesion, and promote the development of socialist construction and reform and opening up. This is the sincere hope of the Party and the people for arts workers. We believe that the broad masses of arts workers will not disappoint this hope. China's socialist arts will surely have a long-term stable development.

　　促进文艺事业长期稳定发展
    本报评论员
    在我国社会主义现代化建设和改革开放不断深入，文艺事业面临时代挑战和考验的新形势下，中共中央发布了《关于进一步繁荣文艺的若干意见》。这是我国文艺领域的一件大事。认真学习和贯彻执行这个文件，是促进我国社会主义文艺事业长期稳定发展的重要保证。
    这个文件，是中共中央有关领导部门，在各级思想、文化、宣传干部和文艺工作者中广泛征求意见，经党中央政治局讨论制定出来的。文件认真总结了我们党在对文艺事业的领导方面的经验教训，探索和研究了在新的历史条件下领导好文艺工作的指导思想和方式方法，对改善和加强党对文艺事业的领导，具有十分重要的指导意义。
    长期以来，党在对文艺事业的领导方面有过一些成功的经验，也有许多失误、甚至惨痛的教训。坚持“以阶级斗争为纲”和对文艺功能的狭隘理解，曾经严重束缚和挫伤了文艺生产力，阻碍了文艺事业正常、健康的发展。十年动乱时期，文坛艺坛一片荒漠。党的十一届三中全会以后。拨乱反正，文艺创作的规律得到尊重，文艺方针政策作了重大调整，广大文艺工作者思想获得很大解放，创作获得很大自由，我国的文艺事业发生了历史性的重大变化。尽管这十年中文艺工作的发展中也存在一些不健康的倾向，但是党对文艺工作的领导毕竟趋于成熟了。这个文件明确指出，党对文艺事业的领导是政治原则、政治方向的领导，是制定和调整文艺方针、政策，做好思想政治工作，保证文艺沿着正确的方向发展；党的领导机关要充分尊重文艺的特点和规律，对具体的文艺作品和学术问题，要少干预、少介入；领导者要正确执行党的路线、方针和政策，努力探索和研究在新的历史条件下的领导文艺的方式和方法，等等，都是极其宝贵的经验的总结。对保证我国文艺事业长期稳定的发展至关重要。　　
    这个文件提出在新的历史条件下，仍然要坚持文艺“为人民服务、为社会主义服务”的方向，坚持“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，并鲜明地提出“我们的文艺要高举爱国主义、社会主义的旗帜，弘扬社会主义人道主义精神，为实现四化、振兴中华而不懈奋斗”。文艺工作者作为一个特殊的精神劳动者，写什么和怎么写都享有充分的自由，党不再要求文艺从属于政治，更不要求从属于临时的、具体的、直接的政治任务。对文艺工作者来说，则有一个正确地理解文艺的社会意义和明确自己的社会责任问题。我们要继承和发扬我国革命文艺的优良传统，充分发挥文艺的多种功能，多创作有利于社会主义现代化建设和全面改革的优秀之作，有利于激发人们奋发图强、开拓创新、积极进取的优秀之作，以及有利于陶冶人们道德情操的优秀之作，以提高民族的自信心，增强民族的凝聚力，促进社会主义建设和改革开放的发展。这是党和人民对文艺工作者的热忱希望。相信广大文艺工作者是不会辜负这个希望的。我国的社会主义文艺事业，必将有一个长期稳定的发展。
