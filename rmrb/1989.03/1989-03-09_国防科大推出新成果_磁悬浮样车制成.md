National University of Defense Technology Unveils New Achievement: Magnetic Levitation Test Car Completed

    CHANGSHA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- National University of Defense Technology today revealed to the media: China's first small-scale magnetic levitation experimental test car has been successfully developed.

    Magnetic levitation trains use magnetic force to lift the train body off the ground, separating it from the track. The train's forward motion is driven by a linear induction motor. Its characteristics include high speed, with a potential top speed of 500 kilometers per hour; low noise; superior comfort and stability during travel, making it the best among current transportation options; long lifespan; and low maintenance costs. Experts predict that magnetic levitation trains could be a highly sought-after high-tech product by the end of this century or the beginning of the next.

    The Automatic Control Department of National University of Defense Technology has been researching this technology for many years. The small-scale magnetic levitation principle test car they developed has no wheels; the distance between the car and the track during operation is approximately 5 millimeters; it weighs 140 kilograms and can carry an effective load of 80 kilograms (including a battery that will soon be removed, weighing 60 kilograms); it is driven by a linear motor and runs smoothly on a 10-meter-long track, with a maximum speed of approximately 10 meters per second.

    This achievement by National University of Defense Technology indicates that China has mastered the core technology of magnetic levitation trains, opening a new field in China's automated technology research.

　　国防科大推出新成果
    磁悬浮样车制成
    本报长沙３月８日电  记者吴兴华报道：国防科技大学今天向新闻界披露：我国第一台小型磁悬浮实验样车研制成功。
    磁悬浮列车靠磁力把车身悬离地面，使其与轨道脱离接触。列车前进由直线感应电机推动。它的特点是：速度快，时速可达５００公里；噪音低；乘坐时平稳、舒适程度是当前行驶的交通工具中最好的；寿命长；维修费用低。专家们预计，磁悬浮列车可能是本世纪末下世纪初高技术产品的抢手货。
    国防科技大学自动控制系对该项技术已进行多年的研究。他们研制的小型磁悬浮原理样车没有车轮；运行时车轨之间距离约５毫米；毛重１４０公斤，可承受有效载荷８０公斤（含不久将被去掉的蓄电瓶６０公斤）；由直线电机推动，在１０米长的轨道上运行平稳，最高速度约每秒１０米。
    国防科技大学的这一研制成果，表明我国已掌握磁悬浮列车的核心技术，开创了我国自动化技术研究的一个新领域。
