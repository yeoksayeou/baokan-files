In the afternoon of March 22, the reporter attended the discussion meeting of the CPPCC Ethnic Group Subcommittee and heard a vivid speech by Lobsang Loden, the Vice Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region CPPCC.

I arrived in Beijing on March 14, a few days after the martial law was imposed on March 8. We felt that the martial law issued by the State Council against a few separatist elements was timely. After the imposition of martial law, all the members and staff of our CPPCC office were able to go to work on time and restore normal work order.

The Tibet Autonomous Region CPPCC brings together many people from the ethnic and religious circles as well as other sectors. However, a few separatist elements say that the CPPCC members are the running dogs of the Communist Party and the Han people, a bunch of pigs raised by the Communist Party, and that these offices are pigsties, threatening to smash and burn them. They have distributed such reactionary leaflets or open letters.

Their evil deeds exposed their evil intentions, which is to restore their lost paradise, to oppress the majority as they did in the past.

Under such circumstances, a few people in the United States and Europe specifically made so-called resolutions on the Tibet issue, blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs, using the so-called human rights issue to support Tibetan independence and separatism.

To say that there are no human rights in Tibet is actually a blatant lie. The real lack of human rights was under the feudal serfdom system.

I am 55 years old this year. When Tibet was peacefully liberated, I was only 19. At that time, our Lamu family was the largest family in the rear of Tibet. Although I was only 19, I owned my own estate. In the estate, the vast majority of serfs had no personal freedom. I myself had written such notes, saying that I no longer wanted this serf, giving it to another estate. To change people, just write a note. To become a monk in a temple, one had to be approved. Under the feudal serfdom system, serfs indeed had no personal freedom, and from the perspective of religious belief, they had no freedom of belief. At that time, there were many monks in the major temples in Tibet, but many of them were not out of religious belief but were conscripted labor. At that time, Tibet's economy was very backward. Now, under the leadership of the Party, the Tibetan people truly have the freedom of religious belief.

In our Tibet Autonomous Region, ethnic minorities, including Tibetans, account for more than 60% of the provincial-level cadres, and about 80-90% of the county-level cadres are Tibetans or other ethnic minorities. All the cadres working in the districts of the counties are ethnic minorities. Some people say there are no human rights in Tibet, which is a blatant lie.

Premier Li Peng said in his report that as long as the Dalai Lama gives up the idea of "Tibetan independence," does not engage in separatist activities, and maintains national unity and ethnic solidarity, the central government is willing to negotiate with him. Premier Li Peng's words fully reflect the wishes of the broad masses of the Tibetan people and the broad masses of monks and nuns. In history, Tibet regarded the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama as the leaders of the nation and religion, and they were highly respected. There was a saying in the past: the sun and the moon in the sky, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama on the earth. However, if the Dalai Lama does not give up the idea of "Tibetan independence," it would be against the interests of religion. Therefore, I hope the Dalai Lama can start from the fundamental interests of the Tibetan people and from the interests of maintaining national unity, and give up the idea of "Tibetan independence."

　　索朗伦珠谈西藏人权        
    ——政协民族组小组讨论实录
    本报记者  费伟伟
    ３月２２日下午，记者在政协民族组的小组讨论会上，听到西藏自治区政协常务副主席拉敏·索朗伦珠这样一番生动的发言。
    我是３月１４日来北京的，离３月８日实行戒严有好几天了。我们感到，国务院针对少数分裂主义分子下的戒严令下得正是时候。戒严后，我们政协机关所有的委员和职工才能按时上下班，恢复正常工作秩序。
    自治区政协聚集了许多民族界、宗教界还有其他阶层的人。但是少数分裂主义分子讲，政协的人是共产党、汉人的走狗，是共产党养的一群猪，这些机关是猪圈，扬言要砸烂，要烧。他们散发过这样的反动传单或公开信。
    他们的罪恶行径暴露了他们的罪恶目的，就是想恢复他们失去的天堂，像过去那样，少数人骑在多数人脖子上作威作福。
    在这样的情况下，美国和欧洲的少数人专门作出所谓西藏问题决议，很露骨地干涉我国的内政，利用所谓人权问题支持西藏独立，搞分裂。
    说在西藏没有人权，这实际上是睁着眼睛说瞎话。真正没有人权是在封建农奴制度下。
    我今年５５岁，西藏和平解放时才１９岁。当时我们拉敏家族是后藏最大的家族。我虽然只有１９岁，却拥有自己的庄园，在庄园里，广大的农奴是没有任何人身自由的。我自己也曾写过这样的条子，说我的这个农奴不要了，给另外一个庄园。再换人，写个条子就行了。要求到寺庙当喇嘛，只有经过批准才能当的。在封建的农奴制度下，农奴确实是没有任何人身自由的，就是从宗教信仰的角度讲，他们也没有信仰的权利。当时在西藏各大寺院的喇嘛很多，但是有许多不是出于宗教信仰，是支差。当时西藏经济非常落后，现在在党的领导下，西藏人民才真正有宗教信仰的自由。
    在我们西藏自治区省级干部中，藏族和其他少数民族干部占６０％以上，县级干部中大约８０—９０％是藏族或其他少数民族干部，在县里的区工作的干部全部是少数民族干部。有人讲在西藏没有人权，这是睁着眼睛说瞎话。
    李鹏总理在报告中讲，达赖喇嘛只要放弃“西藏独立”的主张，不搞分裂活动，维护祖国统一和民族团结，中央政府就愿意同他进行谈判。李鹏总理这段话完全符合广大西藏人民的心愿，符合广大僧尼的心愿。在历史上，西藏把达赖和班禅作为民族和宗教的领袖，对他们两个是非常敬重的。过去有句俗话：天上太阳和月亮，地上达赖和班禅。但是，如果达赖喇嘛不放弃“西藏独立”的主张的话，就违背了宗教的利益。所以我希望达赖喇嘛能够从西藏人民的根本利益出发，能够从维护祖国统一的利益出发，放弃“西藏独立”的主张。
