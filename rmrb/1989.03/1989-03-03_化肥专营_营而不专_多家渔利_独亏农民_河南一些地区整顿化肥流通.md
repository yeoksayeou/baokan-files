People's Daily, Zhengzhou, March 2nd. Reporter Li Erliang recently visited Minquan and Lankao counties in Henan and learned that the supply of fertilizers in these areas is still through multiple channels, leading to a chaotic market and high prices.

The lack of effective regulation in the distribution channels is one of the reasons why the fertilizer monopoly policy is difficult to implement. After the implementation of the monopoly policy, non-monopoly units and individual vendors have not been able to transfer their accumulated fertilizers to the agricultural resource departments due to issues related to price, funds, and quality. A significant amount of fertilizers are still stuck in non-monopoly channels. According to Minquan County, if all these fertilizers were to be accepted, it would require 5 million yuan. The county's finances are strained, and the bank is also unable to provide assistance. On the other hand, according to Minquan County leaders, due to the current tight funds and transportation issues, the main channels also find it difficult to ensure a stable supply of fertilizers. They are also concerned that while local control is strict, external control is lax, and the local market will still be affected.

Non-monopoly entities directly purchasing fertilizers from manufacturers for resale is another cause of the chaotic fertilizer market. During the off-season for fertilizer sales, some manufacturers, in order to reduce inventory and recover funds, sell freely. Non-monopoly units and individuals take advantage of this to buy in bulk and hoard, creating artificial shortages. Before the Spring Festival, a fertilizer plant in Lankao County sold 5,000 tons of fertilizers to clear inventory, most of which were bought by non-monopoly entities. These fertilizers are still causing trouble in the market.

From the problems exposed in the fertilizer black market in Kaifeng, it is evident that the more important cause of the chaos is that monopoly units issue vouchers to sell fertilizers, which are then resold. According to investigations by relevant departments, the Kaifeng Agricultural Resources Company issued approximately 600 vouchers to various "connections" from January 1st to February 17th, selling 462 tons of fertilizers, estimated to be about 1/4 of the planned supply. A significant portion of these fertilizers ended up in the black market.

As long as the situation of multiple channels supplying fertilizers does not change, the ones who suffer are still the farmers. This year, for wheat top-dressing, many fertilizers did not reach the farmers through normal channels and prices. Due to criticism from the media, various levels of government and relevant departments recently conducted a cleanup of the fertilizer market. With the wheat top-dressing season basically over, the chaotic situation in the fertilizer market has been rectified. However, people are concerned that if the problems are not fundamentally resolved, when the next peak season for fertilizer use arrives, will the monopoly work face another impact?

### 化肥专营　营而不专  多家渔利　独亏农民  河南一些地区整顿化肥流通

    化肥专营  营而不专
    多家渔利  独亏农民
    河南一些地区整顿化肥流通
    本报郑州3月2日电　记者李而亮近日在河南民权、兰考两县了解到，这里化肥供应仍是多渠道经营，市场混乱，价格居高不下。
    流通渠道整顿不力，是化肥专营难落实的原因之一。实行专营后，属非专营单位、个体户积存的化肥在向农资部门移交中，由于价格、资金、质量等问题不能成交，相当数量的化肥仍滞留在非专营渠道。据民权县反映，如果将其全部接收过来，需要500万元资金。县财政无力，银行也爱莫能助。另一方面，据民权县领导说，由于目前资金、交通运输紧张，主渠道也难以保化肥供应的稳定。他们还担心，当地卡得紧，外地管不住，本地市场还是要受冲击。
    非专营者直接从厂家挖货倒卖，是化肥市场混乱的另一原因。化肥销售淡季时，为了减少库存、回笼资金，一些厂家放手销售，非专营单位与个人趁机套购，囤积居奇。年前，兰考县一家化肥厂为解决积压，抛售5000吨化肥，大多为非专营者买去。这些化肥至今还在市场上兴风作浪。
    从开封市化肥黑市暴露的问题看，专营单位凭条子把化肥批出去转手倒卖，是造成混乱的更重要原因。据有关部门的调查，开封市农资公司从元月1日到2月17日，给各种“关系户”开后门批条子约600张，批出化肥462吨，据估算占计划供应化肥的1／4。其中不少进了黑市。
    多渠道供应化肥的状况不改变，吃亏的还是农民。今年小麦追肥，许多化肥没有通过正常渠道和价格到达农户手里。由于新闻单位的批评，各级政府和有关部门最近对化肥市场进行了整顿，加上小麦追肥已基本结束，化肥市场的混乱状况已经扭转。人们担心，如果问题得不到根本解决，在紧接着而来的农药、农膜和下一个化肥施用高峰到来时，专营工作会不会再度受到冲击？
