The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's national savings work conference, which concluded today in Xi'an, proposed that this year, attracting savings from individual businesses should be a key focus of savings work.

According to relevant national departments, there are currently over 23 million individual businesses in China engaged in industries such as manufacturing, commerce, transportation, and repair services. Assuming an average of 3,000 yuan in cash per business per year, the country has nearly 70 billion yuan in substantial savings.

The conference proposed a series of measures to provide savings services for individual industrial and commercial households, mainly including: establishing special counters for individual businesses in savings outlets with conditions, providing large-denomination cash; offering appointment-based deposits and withdrawals, and door-to-door collection services for individual businesses; providing cash management services, trial check services, and large-denomination time-deposit savings for individual businesses; and operating multi-functional services such as savings, loans, and remittances in some well-established savings outlets in market trading areas. Many grassroots banks and branches also plan to appoint savings agents among individual businesses with good business practices and reliable credit.

　　开设专柜　上门服务　保管现金　试办支票
    工商银行为个体户储蓄行方便
    据新华社西安３月４日电  （记者姜卯生）今天在西安闭幕的中国工商银行全国储蓄工作会议提出，今年要把吸收个体户的存款作为储蓄工作的重点来抓。
    据国家有关部门公布，目前我国从事工业、商业、运输业以及修理服务业的个体户已达２３００多万户，以每户平均年持现金３０００元计算，全国就有近７００亿元数额可观的储源。
    会议就此提出了一系列为个体工商户储蓄存款提供服务的措施，主要内容是：有条件的储蓄所将开设个体户专柜，提供大面额现钞；对个体户开展预约存取款，进行上门收款；为个体户开办现金保管业务、试办支票业务和大面额定活两便储蓄业务；在集市贸易区一些基础好的储蓄所开办存、放、汇多功能业务。许多基层行、处还打算在一些经营作风好、信誉可靠的个体户中聘请协储员。
