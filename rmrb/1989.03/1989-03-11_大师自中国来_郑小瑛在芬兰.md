On the eve of Christmas 1988, Zheng Xiaoying boarded a flight to Helsinki with her beloved baton and scores. She was invited by Mrs. Irma Revelle, Chair of the Vaasa Opera Society and Vice Chair of the Finnish Opera Federation, to conduct Puccini's famous opera "Madame Butterfly" at the Vaasa Opera House. This was her second visit to Finland after successfully conducting the Central Opera Theater at the Savonlinna Opera Festival in the summer of 1988. The Finnish media paid close attention to this event. Upon her arrival, local newspapers reported extensively with headlines such as "Master from China arrives at Vaasa Opera House," "A 'Butterfly' flies from China to Finland," and "An unofficial cultural exchange – Zheng Xiaoying returns to Finland." Mrs. Revelle was delighted, saying, "To bring Zheng Xiaoying from Beijing is an unexpected Christmas gift from God." For Zheng Xiaoying, the Central Opera Theater was her familiar partner, but this time she had to collaborate with an entirely unfamiliar opera house, which presented some challenges.

The first difficulty Zheng Xiaoying encountered was a 36-member orchestra. Typically, for such a grand opera, the orchestra would need at least 68 members. She spent a great deal of effort adjusting the orchestration and score for this smaller ensemble to maintain the integrity of the sound. With her traditional style, clear rhythm, and appropriate tempo, she led the small orchestra to perform at its best.

As an opera conductor, one must not only "watch" the orchestra and "see" the stage performance but also "listen" to the singers. Opera singers often perform from memory, and mistakes are inevitable during the performance. This requires the conductor to react quickly and timely guide the rescue. Zheng Xiaoying is an experienced conductor who can effectively organize the orchestra and singers, leaving room for soloists. Thus, Puccini's multi-layered and highly abstract music seamlessly integrates with the stage's realistic dramatic performance.

On January 5, "Madame Butterfly" premiered at the Seinäjoki Theater and was a great success. The Finnish media immediately gave it high praise. The *Tampere Morning Post* commended the Seinäjoki "Butterfly" as reaching the "highest national standard." The focus of the praise ultimately fell on conductor Zheng Xiaoying: "The soul of the entire performance is Zheng Xiaoying from the Central Opera Theater of China," "The Chinese conductor's sensitive, flexible, and profound understanding of Puccini's score is one of the conditions for the success of the Seinäjoki 'Butterfly,'" and "Her conducting gestures are a feast for the eyes."

The performance in Seinäjoki sold out for 16 consecutive shows, even attracting many people from neighboring Sweden. A manager from a Swedish opera house expressed interest in inviting Zheng Xiaoying to conduct as a guest. Her charm left a deep impression on local music lovers.

　　“大师自中国来”
    ——郑小瑛在芬兰
    田润民
    １９８８年圣诞节前夕，郑小瑛带着她那心爱的指挥棒和乐谱登上了飞往赫尔辛基的班机。她是应芬兰瓦沙歌剧协会主席、全芬歌剧联合会副主席伊尔玛·雷维尔夫人的邀请，前往芬兰指挥瓦沙歌剧院演出世界著名歌剧《蝴蝶夫人》的。这是她于１９８８年夏季成功地指挥中央歌剧院参加了芬兰萨沃林纳歌剧艺术节以后，第二次赴芬兰访问。芬兰舆论界对此十分注目。她一到芬兰，当地报界纷纷以“大师从中国来到瓦沙歌剧院”、“一只‘蝴蝶’从中国飞到芬兰”、“一次非官方文化交流——郑小瑛再次来芬兰”为题进行报道。雷维尔夫人十分高兴地说：“能从北京把郑小瑛请来，是上帝赐给我们的意外的圣诞礼物。”对郑小瑛说来，中央歌剧院毕竟是她的“老搭档”，这一次要和一个完全陌生的歌剧院合作，还是有些困难。
    郑小瑛遇到的第一个困难是一个只有３６人的乐队。通常，排这样一部大歌剧，乐队至少要６８人，为此，她花了很大的功夫为这个小乐队调整声谱和总谱，使乐队和声基本上保持完整。她以传统的风格、清晰的节奏和恰当的速度进行指挥，使这支小乐队的演奏达到了最佳水平。
    作为歌剧指挥，不仅要眼“盯”着乐队，“看”台上表演，还要“听”演员歌唱。歌剧演员由于“背谱”演唱，演出中难免出错，这就要求指挥迅速作出反应，及时带队“抢救”。郑小瑛是个经验丰富的指挥家，她能够把乐队和演员很好地组织在一起，并给独唱演员留有余地，从而使普契尼多层次的、非常抽象的音乐与舞台上反映现实生活的戏剧表演融为一体。
    １月５日，《蝴蝶夫人》在塞纳约基市剧院首演成功。芬兰报界立即予以高度评价，《坦培列晨报》称赞塞纳约基剧院的“蝴蝶”“达到了（芬兰）国家的最高水平。”对这场演出赞美的焦点最后集中在指挥郑小瑛身上：“整个演出的灵魂是中国中央歌剧院的指挥郑小瑛”，“中国指挥对普契尼总谱敏感、灵活及深刻的理解是塞纳约基‘蝴蝶’成功的条件之一”，“她指挥的手势对眼睛来说是一种享受”。
    在塞纳约基演出１６场，场场爆满，甚至吸引邻国瑞典许多人前来观看。一家瑞典歌剧院的经理还表示要邀请郑小瑛去瑞典担任客座指挥。她的风采给当地音乐迷们留下了极深的印象。
