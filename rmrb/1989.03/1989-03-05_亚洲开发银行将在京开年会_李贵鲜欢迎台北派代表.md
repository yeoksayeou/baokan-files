The 22nd annual meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank will be held in Beijing from May 4 to 6 this year.

Li Guixian, the Chairman of this year's meeting and Vice Premier and Governor of the People's Bank of China, met with the Secretary-General of the Asian Development Bank, Alan P. P. Adak, this morning. Li expressed his welcome to all members of the ADB to come to Beijing for the meeting.

Li asked Adak and the ADB authorities to convey a message to Taiwan: We welcome a delegation from Taipei to attend the 22nd annual meeting, provided that they comply with the memorandum of understanding reached between the Chinese government and the Asian Development Bank. We will provide conveniences for the Taipei delegation and give them a good reception.

The memorandum of understanding clearly stipulates that, from the time the People's Republic of China is admitted as the sole legal representative of China to the Asian Development Bank, the authorities in Taiwan will remain in the ADB under the name of "Chinese Taipei."
