	Sudanese Parties Demand Dissolution of Cabinet and Formation of National Salvation Government

	Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, February 28th - On the 27th, 38 political parties and organizations in Sudan submitted a memorandum to the Supreme Council of the State, the Cabinet, and the Parliament, demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and the establishment of a national salvation government.

	The memorandum calls for the dissolution of the current cabinet and the formation of a new cabinet to accept and implement the peace agreement reached last November between the former coalition government partner, the Democratic Unionist Party, and the southern rebel forces.

	Earlier the same day, Prime Minister al-Mahdi appealed to the military and trade unions to allow him to form a new government, otherwise, he would resign. His threat provoked a reaction from various parties, further exacerbating the situation.

	Meanwhile, the General Command of the Sudanese Armed Forces, after holding an emergency high-level military meeting, issued a statement tonight demanding that the Head of State al-Mirghani and Prime Minister al-Mahdi meet all the demands outlined in their memorandum of the 20th. They insisted on the military's constitutional right to ensure national security and territorial integrity, as well as to defend the goals and achievements of the 1985 People's Revolution.

	The military statement rejected accusations of indiscipline within the military. It pointed out that steadfastly supporting the military is the only way to restore the country's strategic and military balance.

	The statement emphasized that the armed forces support democracy and the choice of the Sudanese people.

    苏丹各党派要求解散内阁
    成立民族救国政府
    新华社喀土穆2月28日电  苏丹38个政党和组织27日向国家最高委员会、内阁和议会递交一份备忘录，要求萨迪克·迈赫迪总理辞职，成立一个民族救国政府。
    备忘录要求解散现内阁，组成一个新内阁，以接受和实施前联合政府伙伴联合民主党去年11月同南方反政府力量达成的和平协议。
    同一天早些时候，迈赫迪总理在议会讲话中呼吁军队和工会组织让他放手组织新政府，否则他将辞职。他的威胁激起了各党派的反应，使局势进一步恶化。
    与此同时，苏丹武装部队统帅部在举行高级军队紧急会议后于今晚发表一项声明，要求国家元首米尔加尼和总理迈赫迪满足他们20日备忘录中提出的所有要求，并坚持军队行使宪法中规定的确保国家安全和领土完整以及保卫1985年人民革命的目标和成果的权力。
    军方声明拒绝了军队不遵守纪律的指责。它指出，坚持不渝地支持军队是这个国家恢复战略和军事平衡的唯一途径。
    声明强调，武装部队支持民主和苏丹人民的抉择。
