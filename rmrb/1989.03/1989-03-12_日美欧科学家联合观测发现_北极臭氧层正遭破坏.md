Our reporter Yu Qing reports from Tokyo on March 11th: The results of a joint observation of the Arctic ozone layer by Japanese, American, and European scientists indicate that the Arctic ozone layer, like the Antarctic ozone layer, is located in the stratosphere at an altitude of 25 to 30 kilometers above the Earth. It absorbs ultraviolet rays from the sun, protecting life on Earth.

This observation revealed that in the Arctic stratosphere at altitudes of 22 to 28 kilometers, the ozone concentration has decreased by an average of about 15% annually, with a maximum decrease of approximately 30%. These conditions are conducive to the formation of an "ozone hole."

　　日美欧科学家联合观测发现
    北极臭氧层正遭破坏
    本报东京３月１１日电  记者于青报道：此间发表的日美欧科学家联合观测北极臭氧层结果表明，北极臭氧层同南极臭氧层是地球上空２５～３０公里处的同温层，能吸收太阳的紫外线，保护地球上的生物。
    这次观测发现，在北极上空２２～２８公里处，臭氧量比例年平均减少约１５％，最多约达３０％，并具备形成“臭氧洞”的条件。
