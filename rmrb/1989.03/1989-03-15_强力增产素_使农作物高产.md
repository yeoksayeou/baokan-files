"Strong Growth Promoter" Boosts Crop Yields

The People's Daily, Shanghai, March 14 — Reporter Xiao Guan Gen reports: In 1988, after spraying "Strong Growth Promoter" on 3,700 mu of rice and over 40 mu of soybeans, Shanghai Hongxing Farm saw yield increases of 10% and 28% respectively. Today, users and research units from various regions gathered at Shanghai Railway University for a technical exchange meeting to discuss the broader application of this achievement.

The "Strong Growth Promoter" developed by the Applied Chemistry Research Room at Shanghai Railway University is a plant nutrient suitable for various crops. It is composed of trace elements, the newly developed efficiency enhancer K, and bee-derived triacontanol. After trials in various regions, grain crops saw yield increases of over 10%, while economic crops and vegetables saw increases of 30%.

　　“强力增产素”使农作物高产
    本报上海３月１４日电  记者萧关根报道：１９８８年，上海红星农场的３７００亩水稻和４０多亩黄豆喷洒“强力增产素”后，产量分别增加１０％和２８％。今天，各地用户和研制单位在上海铁道学院举行应用技术交流会，准备在更大范围推广这个成果。
    上海铁道学院应用化学研究室研制的“强力增产素”是一种适用于多种农作物的植物营养剂，由微量元素、增效剂Ｋ和蜂提三十烷醇组成，其中增效剂Ｋ为国际首创。经各地试验，粮食作物可增产１０％以上，经济作物和蔬菜增产３０％。
