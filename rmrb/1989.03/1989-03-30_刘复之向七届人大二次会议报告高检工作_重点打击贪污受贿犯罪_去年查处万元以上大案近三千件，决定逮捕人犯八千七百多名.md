Liu Fuzhi, the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said today that last year, all levels of procuratorial organs made the fight against corruption and bribery a top priority in their work to combat economic crimes. This effort has achieved certain results.

Liu Fuzhi said, in 1988, procuratorial organs nationwide accepted a total of over 45,700 cases of corruption and bribery, and initiated investigations into 21,100 cases. The number of cases initiated was 10.4% less than the previous year. A total of over 2,900 major cases involving amounts of 100,000 yuan or more were investigated, which was 6.8% less than the previous year. A total of 8,777 suspects were arrested, and 10,356 suspects were prosecuted before the people's courts (including cases carried over from 1987).

Liu Fuzhi said, by the end of 1988, the procuratorial organs had received judgments from the people's courts for 5,911 suspects. Of these, 5,642 were sentenced to imprisonment or more severe punishments, including 74 who were sentenced to life imprisonment or more severe punishments. Among those sentenced, 190 were county-level officials, and 4 were division-level officials; 3,754 were Communist Party members.

Liu Fuzhi said, based on the problems that have been exposed, the current situation with corruption and bribery crimes has the following five prominent features: First, the amounts involved in corruption and bribery are large. According to statistics on cases investigated in 1988, there were 122 cases involving amounts between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan, 22 cases involving amounts between 500,000 and 1,000,000 yuan, and 15 cases involving amounts over 1,000,000 yuan. Second, a large number of those involved in corruption and bribery are grassroots officials who manage finances, accounting for nearly 70% of the offenders. These individuals are often managers, accountants, or procurement officers in enterprises and institutions. Third, a significant number of cases occur in the banking, construction, grain, supply and marketing, and materials sectors. Fourth, the methods used in these crimes are cunning and deceitful. Bribery and corruption often involve organized crime, or single-line contacts, making it difficult to gather evidence and investigate. Fifth, there has been an increase in corruption and bribery cases involving foreign economic activities. Some criminals demand or accept bribes from foreign or overseas businessmen, and the amounts involved are large. Some criminals flee with the money after committing the crime.

He said, based on the problems that have been exposed, the situation with corruption and bribery crimes is serious and harmful, and the people deeply detest it. Among the criminals, some are repeat offenders, but the majority have fallen into crime in an environment where "everything is about money."

Liu Fuzhi pointed out that, based on the problems that have been exposed, overall, the cadres of the Party and state organs are honest and law-abiding. Only a small number have fallen into corruption and bribery crimes. Of course, we cannot therefore relax our efforts in the fight against corruption and bribery, nor can we relax our efforts in promoting clean governance and building a clean government.

　　刘复之向七届人大二次会议报告高检工作        
    重点打击贪污受贿犯罪       
    去年查处万元以上大案近三千件，决定逮捕人犯八千七百多名
    新华社北京３月２９日电最高人民检察院检察长刘复之今天说，去年一年各级检察机关把打击贪污、受贿犯罪的斗争列为检察机关打击经济犯罪的第一位工作，作为检察工作的一个重点来抓，并取得了一定成效。
    刘复之说，１９８８年全国检察机关共受理贪污、受贿案件共４５７００多件，已立案２１１００多件，立案数比上年减少１０．４％。全年共查处万元以上贪污、受贿大案２９００多件，比上年减少６．８％。决定逮捕贪污、受贿人犯８７７７名，向人民法院提起公诉的人犯１０３５６名（含１９８７年度积存数）。
    刘复之说，到１９８８年底，已收到人民法院对５９１１名人犯的判决，判处有期徒刑以上刑罚的５６４２名，其中判处无期徒刑以上刑罚的７４名。被判刑的县级干部１９０名，司局级干部４名；共产党员３７５４名。
    刘复之说，从已经揭露的问题看，当前贪污、受贿犯罪主要有以下５个突出特点：一是贪污、受贿的金额大。根据对１９８８年立案侦查的案件的统计，贪污、受贿１０万至５０万元的１２２件，５０万至１００万元的２２件，１００万元以上的１５件。二是基层掌管财物实权的人多，有近７０％的作案分子是企事业单位的厂长、经理、财会、采购等人员。三是发生在银行、建筑、粮食、供销、物资系统的多。四是作案手段诡秘狡猾，行贿、受贿有的是集团犯罪，更多的是采取单线联系，往往没有现场、不留痕迹，调查、取证的难度很大。五是在对外经济活动中的贪污、受贿案件增多。一些犯罪分子向国外、境外商人索取或接受他们的贿赂，而且犯罪金额大，有的作案后携款潜逃。
    他说，从已经揭露的问题看，贪污、受贿犯罪的情况是严重的，危害很大，群众深恶痛绝。犯罪分子中有的是惯犯，但绝大多数则是在“一切向钱看”的邪气中堕落、犯罪的。
    刘复之指出，从已经揭露的问题看，总体上说，党和国家机关工作人员队伍是廉洁的，是奉公守法的。堕落为贪污、受贿犯罪分子的始终是少数。当然，我们不能因此而放松同贪污、受贿犯罪的斗争，不能放松为政清廉教育和廉政建设。
