Recently, some meteorological stations and bureaus across the country have had a diminishing focus on serving agricultural production, leading to a gradual decline in the quality of meteorological broadcasts.

Taking Dongyang City as an example, during the era of "Learning from Dazhai in Agriculture," the county radio station's meteorological programs included both short-term weather forecasts and long-term weather predictions. In addition to broadcasting the weather forecast for the next two days twice a day, there were also decadal weather reports. Particularly during the spring plowing season, there were specialized weather forecasts for seedling cultivation. At that time, the meteorological service was indeed comprehensive.

However, with the implementation of the agricultural production responsibility system, the decadal weather reports and specialized weather forecasts for the seedling cultivation period were quietly discontinued. The duration of the weather forecasts was also shortened; what was originally a two-day forecast was reduced to just a one-day forecast.

To achieve a bountiful harvest in agricultural production, the efforts of the meteorological departments are indispensable. As someone living in a rural area, I deeply understand the farmers' difficulties.

To achieve a bountiful harvest in agricultural production, farmers hope that meteorological stations can restore the decadal weather reports and improve the accuracy of regular weather forecasts. This request should not be too much to ask of the meteorological department's staff.

### 夺得粮食丰收　期望气象广播

　　夺得粮食丰收　
    期望气象广播
    近年来，各地一些气象台、站为农业生产服务的观念淡薄了，气象节目服务质量逐渐下降。
    拿东阳市来说，在“农业学大寨”的年代，县广播站的气象节目既有近期的天气预报，也有长期的天气预测。除每天早晚二次播送未来两天的天气预报外，还有天气旬报。特别是春耕生产期间，专门有春播育秧的天气预报。那时的气象节目服务可谓周到。
    可是，随着农业生产责任制的落实，天气旬报和春播育秧期间的天气预报不知不觉地被取消了，天气预报的时间也缩短了，本来预报两天的，变成只预报当天的了。
    要夺取农业生产的丰收，没有气象部门的努力，谈何容易？笔者身居农村，深切地了解农民的苦衷。
    为了夺取农业生产的丰收，农民们盼望气象台站能恢复气象旬报，提高平时的气象预报的准确性。这点要求，应该说不是难为气象部门的同志们吧。
