A U.S. super tanker ran aground today about 40 kilometers south of Valdez Harbor in Alaska, resulting in a serious oil spill of over 8 million gallons. An oil slick about 1 kilometer wide and 8 kilometers long has formed on the surface of Prince William Sound.

According to reports, the "Valdez," a tanker belonging to the Exxon Shipping Company, was fully loaded with 60 million gallons of Alaskan crude oil and was heading for Long Beach, California. After leaving the harbor, it attempted to avoid icebergs but unfortunately struck a reef. The ship's hull is still leaking, and the marine pollution has not been cleaned up. The Valdez Harbor has been closed by the Coast Guard.

This is the most serious oil spill accident to date in Alaska. The local fishing industry will suffer losses, and the pristine ecological environment will be damaged.

　　美国大型油轮触礁        
    造成严重漏油事故
    本报华盛顿３月２４日电  记者仓立德报道：美国一艘大型油轮今天在阿拉斯加州瓦尔德兹港以南约４０公里处触礁，造成８００多万加仑原油漏油的严重事故，在威廉太子湾海面上形成一条宽约１公里、长达８公里的飘油带。
    据报道，这艘属于埃克森船运公司的“瓦尔德兹”号油轮满载６０００万加仑阿拉斯加原油，准备驶往加利福尼亚州的长滩。出港后，为躲避冰山，不幸撞上礁石。目前船体裂缝还未完全堵住，海上污染也没有得到清理。瓦尔德兹港已遭海岸警卫队关闭。
    这是阿拉斯加州迄今最严重的一次原油泄漏事故，附近海域的水产业将受损失。纯净的生态环境将遭到破坏。
