    Fallen Leaves Return to Their Roots
    – Deeply Mourn the Passing of Mr. Miu Yuntai
    Lǐ Xībì

    Our country's renowned patriotic democratic personage, political activist, and Vice Chairman of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Mr. Miu Yuntai (1894–1988), passed away on September 3 due to illness at the age of 94. Before liberation, Mr. Miu worked tirelessly for national democracy and against imperialist aggression, defending national sovereignty. In the late 1970s, Mr. Miu returned from the United States and settled in Beijing, making significant contributions to China's modernization and the cause of national reunification, and to consolidating and developing the patriotic united front. His outstanding deeds are widely known among the people.

    I parted ways with Mr. Miu in Kunming in 1949 and did not see him again until 1979 when he returned to China to settle in Beijing. Few of our elders remain, and seeing Mr. Miu again was deeply moving. I used the phrase "fallen leaves return to their roots" to praise Mr. Miu's patriotic act of returning to China. Mr. Miu then shared with me the details of his journey from Hong Kong to the United States and his eventual return to China.

    After leaving Hong Kong, Mr. Miu went to the United States and lived with the former president of Tsinghua University, Mei Yizhi. They agreed to study a few more years and learn more history. They each applied to Columbia University and New York University for admission. Mr. Miu had already registered for night classes at New York University, but due to his family's illness, he had to give up his studies. Chen Cheng, Ye Gongchao, and Jiang Tingfu had repeatedly invited him to Taiwan, but he declined. Although he was abroad, he remained deeply concerned about the situation in his homeland and eagerly awaited the opportunity to return and see the tremendous changes that had taken place after liberation. In 1973, the moment he had long awaited finally arrived. He learned that Premier Zhou Enlai welcomed his return to China for a visit. He eagerly accepted the invitation and, accompanied by his daughter Youcheng and granddaughter Zhu Hong, returned to his motherland after more than 20 years of separation. When Mr. Miu arrived in Beijing, Premier Zhou hosted a banquet in his honor. Premier Zhou and Mr. Miu had not seen each other since the old Political Consultative Conference, more than 20 years ago, and they were both excited to reunite. Premier Zhou also invited Mr. Miu to rest in Beidaihe and met with Marshal Zhu De, who was also resting there. During the Xinhai Revolution, Mr. Miu studied at the Yunnan Speech School, while Marshal Zhu De trained at the Yunnan Military Academy. This meeting was particularly warm. In early 1976, the news of Premier Zhou's passing reached the United States, and Mr. Miu, with a heavy heart, hosted a solemn memorial service in New York, attended by more than a thousand overseas Chinese and Chinese-Americans. That same year, Mr. Miu returned to China for a second visit. By then, the "Gang of Four" had been overthrown, the gloom had lifted, and the sky was clear. Mr. Miu saw a new era of stability and unity in his homeland, and his two visits deepened his understanding and love for socialist China. He decided to return to China to live in a socialist society. In 1979, Mr. Miu resolutely returned to Beijing with his wife, Zhao Peilan. He first went to the American Embassy to declare his renunciation of American citizenship and the restoration of his Chinese citizenship. Mr. Miu's patriotic actions won the admiration and respect of people from all walks of life. He was elected as a member of the Standing Committee of the Fifth National People's Congress and a member of the Fifth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and later as Vice Chairman of the Political Consultative Conference. Mr. Miu was deeply moved by the political status bestowed upon him by the Party and the people. He said with emotion: "Fallen leaves returning to their roots is a common occurrence in old age, but the leaves must also protect the roots; only then can the branches and leaves flourish." Mr. Miu spent ten years in China, and his actions deepened the meaning of the phrase "fallen leaves return to their roots."

    叶落归根
    ——沉痛悼念缪云台先生
    李希泌
    我国著名爱国民主人士、政治活动家、中国人民政治协商会议第七届全国委员会副主席缪云台先生（1894—1988）于9月3日病逝，享年94岁。缪老在解放前为国家民主和反对帝国主义侵略，保护国家权利而不懈努力，70年代末，缪老归自美国，定居北京，为我国四化建设和祖国和平统一事业，为巩固和发展爱国统一战线作出重要贡献，其荦荦大节，多为国人所共知。
    我于1949年和缪老在昆明分别后，一直到1979年缪老回国定居才重逢京华。父辈寥寥无几，遇见缪老，倍感亲切。我用“落叶归根”一词赞美缪老回国定居的爱国行为。缪老遂将解放初他从香港转往美国和回国定居的经过详以告我。
    缪老从香港转往美国后，和原清华大学校长梅贻琦住在一起。他们相约再读几年书，更多学点历史。他们分别到哥伦比亚大学和纽约大学索取入学简章。缪老已到纽约大学登记上夜课，后来由于家属患病，不得已而放弃了学习的打算。陈诚、叶公超和蒋廷黻曾迭电邀约他去台湾，他都谢绝了。他虽身居海外，但他仍非常关心祖国的情况，渴望回国看看解放后翻天覆地的变化。1973年，他盼望已久的时机终于来到了。他获悉周恩来总理欢迎他回国参观。他欣然应召，携带他的女儿瑜成和外孙女朱虹，回到了阔别20余年的父母之邦。当缪老到达北京时，周总理设晚宴欢迎他。周总理和缪老自旧政协会议后，分别已有20余年，旧友重逢，倍感兴奋。周总理又邀请缪老去北戴河休息，并会见了正在那里休息的朱德委员长。辛亥革命时，缪老在云南方言学堂学习，朱委员长则在云南讲武堂习武，此次相见，十分亲切。1976年初，周总理逝世的噩耗传到美国，缪老怀着悲痛的心情，在纽约主持举行了一次隆重的追悼会，参加的华侨和华裔共有千余人。同年，缪老再度回国参观。这时，“四人帮”已被打倒，阴霾顿扫，晴空万里，缪老看到了祖国呈现安定团结的新局面，于是两次回国参观，增加了他对社会主义祖国的了解和热爱。他决定回国定居，过社会主义社会的生活。1979年，缪老毅然偕夫人赵佩玱女士回到北京。他首先到美国大使馆声明放弃美国国籍，恢复中国国籍。缪老的爱国行动，赢得了各界人士的赞扬和尊敬。他被选为第五届全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员和第五届全国政协常委，以后又当选为政协副主席。缪老对党和人民给予的政治地位感愧交加，他感奋地说：叶落归根是老年人的常情，但叶落还须护根，根固然后枝叶才能繁茂。缪老归国十年，用实际行动深化了“叶落归根”一词的含义。
