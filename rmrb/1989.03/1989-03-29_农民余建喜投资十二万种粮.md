Farmer Yu Jianxi Invests 120,000 Yuan in Grain Production

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan on March 28, (correspondent Zhang Daoguo, intern Yang Xingguo) The young farmer Yu Jianxi from Hubei Province's Zhongxiang County invested more than 120,000 yuan in grain production this winter and spring.

	Yu Jianxi is 27 years old this year. His hometown, Qinshui Village, is located in a mining area where industrial and sideline production have developed rapidly. After adjusting the industrial structure, some farmers in the village thought that farming income was low and began to leave their land fallow. Before the winter sowing last year, Yu Jianxi took the initiative to contract 600 mu of land from the village, signing a 5-year contract: to pay the village 18,000 yuan in land fees each year and to be responsible for the village's 90,000 jin of grain procurement task.

　　农民余建喜投资十二万种粮
    据新华社武汉３月２８日电  （通讯员张道国、实习生杨兴国）湖北省钟祥县青年农民余建喜去冬今春用于粮食生产的投资达１２万多元。
    余建喜今年２７岁，他的家乡秦冲村地处矿区，工副业生产发展很快。产业结构调整后，村里部分农民认为种粮收入低，出现撂荒现象。去年冬播前，余建喜主动承包了村里６００亩地，签订了５年的承包合同：每年向村里上缴１．８万元土地费，担负全村９万公斤的粮食定购任务。
