Title: No "God"

There is a saying in the business world that "the customer is king." This phrase is generally correct and holds true in some foreign countries. However, within our borders, as long as our material production cannot meet consumption demands and the market is dominated by sellers, I believe that we, as customers, will not enjoy the privilege of being "king."

The film industry has also adopted this phrase: "the audience is king." However, I doubt any audience member truly believes this. Half of a film's nature is that of a commodity. From this perspective, our financial means are still insufficient to allow audiences to watch whatever they want. The other half of a film is art, which is also subject to ideological and moral regulations and carries educational and cognitive functions. From this perspective, the audience cannot be supreme. Since it is not possible, we might as well not say it.

Apart from objective conditions, the subjective aspect of film creators also does not support this idea. If the audience is "king," what are the artists? Devotees or servants? Young director Wu Ziniu, who recently returned from West Berlin with a Silver Bear award, said at a meeting early this year: "I do not think the audience is 'king.' If the audience is 'king,' we would have to be at its beck and call, fundamentally losing the subjectivity of film or reversing the subject-object relationship. The subject of film should be the creator. I think we should respect the audience's aesthetic tastes, but also consider and even emphasize the creator's subjectivity." He gave the example of Xie Jin, who has so many fans because the audience respects his artistic creation, and he has cultivated tens of thousands of fans. If there is a "king," Xie Jin is the "king."

I sympathize with Wu Ziniu's views. If artists always put themselves behind others (the audience) and always follow others' lead, how can they talk about artistic creation? Moreover, those who say "the audience is king" may be eyeing the money in the audience's pockets. At the same time, I think artists—whether it is Xie Jin or the "Fifth Generation" directors—are not "kings" either. When they are freely creating, they should consider the audience's acceptance ability and the communication between the subject and object. Perhaps individual artists in the fields of fine arts and music can close their doors and consider themselves "kings," but in film, which involves high costs, industrial production, collective creation, collective viewing, and cannot survive without the audience, there is no room for a "unique and supreme" "king."

On one hand, artists are asserting their individuality and respecting originality; on the other hand, in the tide of commodity economy, the audience has full freedom of choice. Therefore, today is an era without a "king." What should we do? Film Bureau Director Teng Jinxian proposed: "Creators and the audience should be in a mutually constraining equal relationship." Although there are still many difficulties in implementing this, it is not a bad ideal relationship.

We do not want to be "kings," and we do not want to worship "kings." Making films and watching films are both human activities, and that is enough.

### 没有“上帝”

　　没有“上帝”
    李彤
    商业界有种说法，叫“顾客就是上帝”。这话按说不错，在某些外国也是实情。但在国门以内，只要我们的物质生产还赶不上消费要求，只要市场还是卖方的一统天下，我相信，我们作为顾客就暂且享受不到“上帝”之福。
    电影界也横向移植说：“观众就是上帝”。但是大约没有哪个观众对此信以为真。电影的一半属性是商品，单就这方面说，我们的财力还不足以供观众想看什么就看什么。电影的另一半是艺术，还有意识形态包括道德规范管着，还承担着教化功能和认识功能，从这方面说，观众也不可能是至高无上的。既然办不到，干脆就别说。
    除了客观条件外，电影创作者主观那一方面也不干。观众是上帝，那艺术家是什么？信徒还是臣仆？刚刚从西柏林抱回了银熊奖的青年导演吴子牛，今年初在一次会议上说：“我认为观众绝不是‘上帝’。如果观众是上帝，我们就得受它摆布，也就从根本上丧失了电影的主体性，或者颠倒了电影的主客体。电影的主体应当是创作者。我觉得既要尊重观众的审美趣味，又要考虑甚至强调创作者的主体意识”。他举例说，谢晋之所以拥有那么多观众，是因为观众尊重谢晋的艺术创作，他培养了成千上万观众。如果说有“上帝”的话，谢晋才是“上帝”。
    我很同情吴子牛的说法。艺术家要是时时甘居人（观众）后，处处俯仰随人，还谈得上什么艺术创造呢？何况口里称“观众就是上帝”者，也许眼里盯着的是观众口袋里的钱。同时我以为，艺术家——无论是谢晋还是“第五代”导演——也不是“上帝”，他们在恣意挥洒地进行创作时，总要考虑一点观众的接受能力，考虑一点主客体之间心灵的沟通。或许从事美术、音乐的个体艺术家还可以关起门来以“上帝”自居，在电影这样一种高成本、工业化生产、集体创作、集体观赏、离开了观众便难以存活的艺术里，容不下一个“唯我独尊”的“上帝”。
    一边是艺术家们张扬个性、尊重独创；一边是商品经济大潮里观众有充分的自由选择权。所以，于今是一个没有“上帝”的时代。那怎么办？电影局长滕进贤提出：“创作人员与观众应处于双向制约的平等关系之中。”虽说认真做起来还有不少难处，但这终不失为一种理想的关系。
    我们不想当“上帝”，我们也不想拜“上帝”。拍电影、看电影的都是人，这就够了。
