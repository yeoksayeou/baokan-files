The Imbalanced Scale of Reason
— A Brief Discussion on the Necessity of Liberal Arts University Students Reading Natural Science Books
By Liu Gang, Reporter of People's Daily

When we examine the knowledge structure of contemporary liberal arts university students, we easily find that on the scale of knowledge, the end with natural science knowledge is high up and trembling in the air.

Modern science has undergone one revolution after another, and numerous interdisciplinary fields have emerged. To explain this phenomenon of "knowledge tilt" merely by the classification and specialization of modern science development seems to avoid the responsibility that the cultural tradition hidden behind social and historical appearances should bear.

In fact, it is not a new idea that liberal arts university students should read more natural science knowledge. From the time when colonialists used the achievements of modern science and technology, such as rapid-fire guns and cannons, to ruthlessly trample on what was considered the "ultimate civilization" of China, countless patriots have passionately called for the rise of the scientific spirit, which was regarded as the "craft of the petty" by traditional ethical culture. However, when they explained why the mainstream of Chinese culture, which is humanities, should absorb advanced science and technology, they tended to be superficial in the sense of seeking knowledge, thus neglecting the exploration of the intrinsic essence of man creating science and the development of science.

The development of history to this day has made natural science research recognized in the sense of epistemology. Some of the evils in traditional culture that hinder the development of natural science have been negated and criticized by people in theory. However, we have not solved the problem of the intrinsic organic connection between humanities and natural science, nor have we clarified the true value of natural science in the construction of modern Chinese culture. This is particularly evident in the current liberal arts education system. As is well known, the method of liberal arts education is basically of an "injection" nature; the knowledge that liberal arts students learn during their university years is mostly "truth" that is close to ideology. On the one hand, various humanities become the verification of certain sacred classic theories, knowledge becomes dogma, and the development and enrichment of disciplines are limited to the interpretation of established "truth." On the other hand, people's ability to think independently is constrained, and thinking becomes rigid. Thus, authority is established, and the exegesis and interpretation of authority certainly do not require as much wisdom as is needed to negate an authority; while the spirit of science, such as refutation and falsification, is weakened, and wisdom is distorted to a certain extent.

Whether it is the development of humanities or natural science, it must follow the laws of its own development while following the laws of the development of human thought and wisdom. As a symbol of human civilization, wisdom is abstracted from the organic synthesis of natural science and humanities. Therefore, the value evaluation of the development level of natural science in a certain period is, in form, knowledge, but in meaning, it is wisdom, which is connected with the perfection of man and the affirmation of human value. In terms of man's full realization, what is important is not the acquisition of knowledge, but the sublimation of knowledge into wisdom. Any behavior that neglects natural science knowledge may harm the pursuit of human perfection.

The most lively factor in human wisdom is the creativity of independent thinking. Since natural science was liberated from religious beliefs, people's ability to think independently has developed freely, and a sun of reason has risen in people's hearts. Under the sunlight of reason, any authority and doctrine must be re-examined, and any self-evident "axiom" must be critically examined in thought. Whatever stands up to criticism and examination will remain the truth; whatever does not stand up to criticism and examination, even if it was once our belief, must be discarded. This "ruthless" light of reason from natural science also illuminates the research of humanities. It provides us with ideological weapons to fight against superstition, ignorance, and dogma in humanities caused by social limitations, helping us to distinguish between metaphysical nonsense and scientific foresight. Therefore, studying and learning natural science can help us truly grasp the essence of reason.

The scientific way of thinking is the starting point and methodology for us to engage in scientific activities. Generally speaking, some basic ways of thinking come from the logical summary of natural science experience. In the history of thought, many qualitative breakthroughs in humanities occurred after natural science revolutions because they borrowed new ways of thinking abstracted from the achievements of natural science. Kant, the German philosopher who was praised by the West as the embodiment of modern thought and the mentor of modern thought, through his profound thinking on Newton's theory and astronomical knowledge at that time, re-examined categories such as time and space, finite and infinite, nature and man, overcame the one-sidedness of traditional rationalism and empiricism in the way of thinking, and constructed a new foundation of thought for modern humanities. It is difficult to imagine that humanities would not borrow the achievements of natural science and achieve a methodological revolution and a theoretical leap. If one is only intoxicated with the deduction of disciplinary system concepts and ignores the methodological significance of natural science, any development of humanities is equivalent to the medieval theological school's "how many angels can stand on the tip of a needle."

From the subjective aspect, as a liberal arts university student, reading widely some natural science books and actively capturing the sparks of wisdom from them can liberate the mind, broaden the horizon, promote the perfection of personality, and break through the limitations of objective education and cultural traditions to seek theoretical insights. Otherwise, one day, you may find that wisdom is also high up and trembling in the air on the scale of thought.

　　失衡的理性天平
    ——小议文科大学生阅读自然科学书籍的必要性
    本报记者  刘刚
    当我们检查当代文科大学生的知识结构时，我们不难发现，在知识的天平上，自然科学知识的一端高高地翘起，在空中颤抖。
    现代科学已经历了一次又一次的革命，各种边缘学科大量出现，对这种“知识倾斜”现象，仅仅用近代科学发展所造成的学科分类和专业化来解释，似乎并不能推脱掉那种藏在社会和历史表象背后的文化传统所应承担的责任。
    其实，文科大学生应多涉猎一些自然科学知识已不是什么新鲜的道理。从殖民主义者用近代科学技术成果制造的快枪利炮，无情地践踏了自认为是“文明之至”的中华大地起，就有无数仁人志士慷慨地呼唤过被传统的伦理文化视为“小人”之术的科学精神的崛起。然而，他们在阐述主流是人文科学的中华文化为什么要汲取先进的科学技术时，不免流于求知意义上的肤浅，从而忽略了人创造科学和科学发展中人的内在本质的探求。
    历史发展到今天，自然科学研究已在认识论意义上得到重视，传统文化中一些阻碍自然科学发展的劣根性也被人们从理论上进行否定和批判。但实际上，我们始终没有解决好人文科学和自然科学内在的有机联系问题，没有弄清在构建现代中华文化中自然科学的真正价值。它尤其突出地表现在现行的文科教育制度中。众所周知，文科教育方法基本上是“灌输”性质的；文科学生在大学期间所学到的知识，大多是与意识形态相贴近的“真理”。一方面，各门人文科学成为对某些神圣的经典理论的证实，知识变成教条，学科的发展和丰富被限定在对既定“真理”的解释上。另一方面，人独立思考问题的能力受到制约，思维僵化。于是权威建立了，对权威的考据和阐释肯定不需要否定一个权威所需要的那么多的智慧；而反驳和证伪等科学精神弱化了，智慧在一定程度上被扭曲了。
    无论是人文科学还是自然科学的发展都必须在遵循自身发展规律的同时，遵循人类思维和智慧发展的规律。作为人类文明标志之一的智慧，是从自然科学和人文科学两部分的有机合成中抽象出来的。因此对自然科学一定时期发展水平的价值评估，从形式上讲是知识，而从其意义上看却是智慧的，是和人的完善与人的价值的肯定相联系的。就人充分实现而言，重要的不是获得知识，而是把知识升华成智慧。任何忽视自然科学知识的行为，都有可能对追求人的完善产生危害。
    人类智慧中最活泼的一个因素是人独立思维的创造力。自从自然科学从宗教信仰中解放出来以后，人的独立思维的能力得到发展的自由天地，人们的心中升起了一颗理性的太阳。在理性的阳光下，任何权威和信条都必须被重新检验，任何不证自明的“公理”都必须在思想上进行批判。凡是经得起批判和检验的东西仍将是真理；凡是经不起批判和检验的东西，即使它曾是我们的信仰，也必须加以抛弃。这种来自于自然科学的“无情”的理性之光同样也照亮了人文科学的研究。它为我们同社会局限性造成的人文科学中的迷信、愚昧、教条等斗争提供了思想武器，帮助我们辨别哪些是形而上学的玄谈，哪些是科学预见。因此，研究和学习自然科学能使我们真正地把握住理性的实质。
    科学的思维方式是我们从事科学活动的出发点和方法论。一般说来，一些基本的思维方式来自于对自然科学经验的逻辑总结。思想史上，人文科学许多质的突破之所以都发生在自然科学革命之后，就是因为借鉴了从自然科学成果中抽象出来的新的思维方式。被西方誉为近代思想化身和现代思想导师的德国哲学家康德，通过对牛顿理论和当时天文学知识的深刻思考，重新考察时间和空间、有限和无限、自然和人等范畴，克服了传统的唯理论和经验论哲学在思维方式上的片面性，为近代人文科学构筑了一个全新的思想基础。很难设想，人文科学不借鉴自然科学的成果，就能进行一场方法论上的革命，实现一次理论上的飞跃。如果仅仅醉心于学科体系概念的推演，无视自然科学在方法论上的意义，任何人文科学的发展不过等同于中世纪神学院“一个针尖上能站几个天使”而已。
    从主体方面说，作为一个文科大学生广泛地阅读一些自然科学的书籍，积极地从中捕捉智慧的火花，既可以解放思想，开拓思路，促进人格的完善化，又可以冲破客观的教育文化传统等限制，求得理论的真知灼见。否则，有一天，你也许会发现在思维的天平上，智慧也被高高地翘起，在空中颤抖。
