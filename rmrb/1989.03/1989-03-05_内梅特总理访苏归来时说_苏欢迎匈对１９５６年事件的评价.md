Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 3rd.

Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Politburo member and Prime Minister Nemeth said tonight upon returning from his visit to the Soviet Union that Soviet leader Gorbachev, when discussing the Hungarian Party's Central Committee plenary session held on February 10-11 and the evaluation of the 1956 events, expressed welcome for the Hungarian Party's evaluation of past events and finding solutions. However, he noted that this is not the final conclusion because further research needs to be conducted within Hungary and internationally.

He said that Gorbachev expressed welcome for pluralism, believing that the essence of pluralism is a democratic issue. At the same time, he pointed out that whether pluralism is to be realized under a one-party system or, as chosen by the Hungarian Party, under a multi-party system, this will be determined by practice. Gorbachev said that the Soviet Union will realize pluralism under a one-party system, but the Soviet Union will not object to Hungary's choice of transitioning from a one-party system to a multi-party system.

He believes that a multi-party system is not a panacea. Its essence is to promote democracy, people's participation in politics, and enhance the people's sense of ownership.

　　内梅特总理访苏归来时说
    苏欢迎匈对１９５６年事件的评价
    新华社布达佩斯３月３日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党政治局委员、政府总理内梅特今晚访苏归来时在机场向匈牙利记者说，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫在谈到对匈党２月１０—１１日的中央全会和对１９５６年事件的评价时表示，欢迎匈党对过去事件的评价，并找到解决的办法。但认为这不是最后定论，因为还要在匈国内和国际上继续进行研究。
    他说，戈尔巴乔夫表示欢迎多元化，认为多元化的实质是民主问题。但同时指出，是在一党制条件下实现多元化，还是像匈党所选择的在多党制条件下实现多元化，这将由实践来决定。戈尔巴乔夫说，苏将在一党制条件下实现多元化，但苏对匈选择从一党制向多党制过渡的形式不会提出任何非议。
    他认为，多党制不是什么灵丹妙药，它的实质是发扬民主、人民参政和增强人民的主人翁感等。
