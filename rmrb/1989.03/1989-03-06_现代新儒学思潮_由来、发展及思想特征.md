The Modern Neo-Confucian Movement

——Its Origins, Development, and Ideological Characteristics

Li Zonggui

Confucianism has developed through three stages: Confucianism, Neo-Confucianism, and Modern Neo-Confucianism. The concept of Modern Neo-Confucianism has recently become popular in the academic and social circles within China. Some people believe that "Modern Neo-Confucianism, in essence, is a cultural trend formed by a group of scholars on the other side of the Taiwan Strait who have mastered modern thought and methods. Through their reflection on China's unsuccessful 'modernization' over the past century and their study of the successful modernization experiences of Japan, Singapore, and other Eastern countries, they have formed a contemporary cultural trend." Others believe that Modern Neo-Confucianism refers to "a new trend that emerged during the Anti-Japanese War to reform traditional Confucianism. It takes Chinese traditional culture as the 'essence,' absorbs Western culture as a 'tool,' and reconstructs traditional Chinese culture, making it a new type of culture that can retain China's traditions and characteristics while adapting to the times and global situation." Still, others believe that "Modern Neo-Confucianism emerged in the 1920s as a scholarly and ideological school that aims to continue the Confucian 'Dao' and is characterized by a strong adherence to Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism. It seeks to integrate and harmonize Western learning with Confucianism to achieve modernization." These definitions each have their merits, but I believe the latter is the most comprehensive, accurate, and concise.

Modern Neo-Confucianism is relative to the original Confucianism of the Pre-Qin period and the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties. Generally, it is believed that the Confucianism represented by Confucius, Mencius, and Xunzi in the Pre-Qin period is the first stage of Confucianism's development, known as Original Confucianism. During the Song and Ming dynasties, Confucianism was reconstructed through the integration of Buddhism, making it philosophical, which is the second stage of Confucianism's development. This period's Confucianism is known as Neo-Confucianism, and its philosophers are known as Neo-Confucians. Overseas scholars have become accustomed to this terminology. Before and after the May Fourth Movement, a group of intellectuals faced the collapse of China's traditional ethics and value system, the invasion of imperialist culture, and the spread of Marxism-Leninism in China. They sought to restore the status and value system of traditional culture, promote Confucianism, and adapt to the times, marking the third stage of Confucianism's development, known as Modern Neo-Confucianism. Scholars with independent ideological systems who represent this social and cultural trend are known as Modern Neo-Confucians, distinguishing them from Neo-Confucians of the Song and Ming dynasties.

Pioneers of Modern Neo-Confucianism:

Liang Shuming, Xiong Shili, He Lin, and Feng Youlan

Since the second half of the 19th century, China's political, economic, military, and social conditions have deteriorated. Western powers imposed various humiliations on the Chinese nation, and China's resistance against foreign invasions often met with setbacks. In terms of ideology and culture, Western influences spread, and traditional ethical concepts and value systems collapsed. China's journey from tradition to modernity was fraught with difficulties. How to recognize the value and future of Chinese traditional culture, face the challenge of Western culture, and find a correct path from tradition to modernity became a major practical problem that a generation of intellectuals pondered. During this period, various ideological and scholarly schools emerged: National Essence School, Western Learning for Practical Use School, Complete Westernization School, and others. Among them, intellectuals represented by Liang Shuming, Zhang Junmai, Feng Youlan, He Lin, and Xiong Shili advocated the fundamental spirit and value system of Chinese traditional culture. Since the 1920s, they have sought to maintain the essence and leading position of Chinese traditional culture in the conflict between Chinese and Western cultures and between tradition and modernity. They have used this as a basis to integrate Western learning and harmonize Chinese and Western cultures to respond to the challenges of Western culture and Marxism. These intellectuals are what we call Modern Neo-Confucians, and the social and scholarly cultural trends they represent are the Modern Neo-Confucian trend.

Liang Shuming is a pioneer of Modern Neo-Confucianism. As early as 1921, he published the book "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies." He believed that the difference between Eastern and Western cultures lies in the fundamental differences in "life orientation." He used the standards of "will" moving forward, backward, and maintaining balance to categorize the Western, Indian, and Chinese cultural systems into three different orientations. He believed that only a life based on Confucian thought could make one taste the "true flavor of life," and thus Confucian thought is the ideal destination of human culture. "The future culture of the world is the revival of Chinese culture." During the peak of the May Fourth Movement's anti-Confucian and anti-traditional fervor, he publicly advocated Confucianism, promoted Confucian studies, and advocated "following the path of Confucius," doing nothing but "expounding Confucius."

Xiong Shili participated in the Xinhai Revolution in his youth, believed in Buddhism in his middle age, and advocated the study of the Yogacara school. Later, he turned from Buddhism to Confucianism, using the "Book of Changes" as his doctrine, and created a unique philosophical system called "New Yogacara." He believed that after the May Fourth Movement, people's pursuit of Western science and technology was actually an emotional attachment to the superficial aspects of Western thought, a result of blindly worshipping the West. He demanded that the understanding of the West must be combined with the reconstruction of China's value system, that is, the establishment of the "essence" of Chinese culture. His philosophy was an effort in this regard from an ontological perspective.

He Lin advocated "New Heart Learning." "New Heart Learning" is a product of the integration of Western Neo-Hegelianism and Chinese Lu-Wang Heart Learning. He Lin held a negative attitude towards both National Essence and Complete Westernization. In August 1941, he published an article titled "The New Development of Confucian Thought" in the magazine "Thought and Era," first proposing the concept of "Neo-Confucianism" in the sense of what we now call "Modern Neo-Confucianism," and providing a detailed and systematic exposition of the ideological views of Neo-Confucianism. This article is considered a representative work of Modern Neo-Confucianism. In the article, he clearly proposed the idea of "taking Confucian thought as the essence and Western culture as the tool." He believed that over the past thousands of years, Confucian thought has been constantly reconstructed in its development process and has always been able to adapt to the new spirit of the times. Based on his observations of the trends in modern Chinese culture and thought, he asserted that Neo-Confucianism is the mainstream of modern Chinese thought, and reality is "forming a new Confucian movement." He believed that "national revival, in essence, should be the revival of national culture, the revival of Confucian culture." He advocated the introduction and mastery of Western culture to enrich Confucian thought. The life and death of the Chinese national spirit and culture depend on whether Western culture can be Sinicized, Chineseized, and made Chinese. "The question of whether Chinese culture can be revived is also the question of whether it is possible to Sinicize Western culture, to take national spirit as the essence, and to use Western culture as the tool."

Feng Youlan advocated "New Metaphysics." During the War of Resistance, he wrote "Six Books of Zhengyuan," including "New Metaphysics," "New Discussions," "New Social Ethics," "New Origin of Man," "New Origin of Dao," and "New Words of Knowledge," which mainly propagated his "thought close to Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism." He publicly stated that his New Metaphysics is "continuing" Song-Ming Metaphysics, not "following" it. The "new" lies in his taking Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism as the orthodox, absorbing Western philosophy, mainly using the logical analysis methods of new realism to study Chinese traditional philosophy, reconstructing Song-Ming Metaphysics, and integrating new realism with Cheng-Zhu Neo-Confucianism to form a new metaphysical thought system.

Generally speaking, the social and scholarly cultural trends represented by the above four scholars, Liang, Xiong, He, and Feng, are the early stage of the development of Modern Neo-Confucianism. After liberation, the Modern Neo-Confucian trend in mainland China was basically silent and mainly shifted to the Hong Kong and Taiwan regions, where it developed further.

Representative figures of Hong Kong and Taiwan Neo-Confucianism in the 1950s:

Tang Junyi, Mou Zongsan, Xu Fuguan, and Qian Mu

In the 1950s, Tang Junyi, Mou Zongsan, Xu Fuguan, and Qian Mu, representing Hong Kong and Taiwan Neo-Confucians, wrote books, delivered speeches, and traveled between Asia, Europe, and America to promote the value system of Chinese traditional culture centered on Confucianism and to promote traditional Confucianism. They used Western philosophical methods to analyze Chinese culture, used the shortcomings of modern Western society to contrast the advantages of Chinese culture, and advocated the adoption of certain positive elements of Western culture to reconstruct Chinese-centered culture. The most representative work is the cultural declaration "A Declaration to the World on Chinese Culture" (subtitled "Our Common Understanding of Chinese Scholarship Research and the Future of Chinese and World Culture") co-authored by Tang Junyi, with Mou Zongsan, Xu Fuguan, and Zhang Junmai as co-signers, which caused a sensation at the time. The "declaration" systematically expounded their basic positions and views on the past, present, and future of Chinese culture, as well as the relationship between Chinese and Western cultures, and proposed the ideological guideline of Modern Neo-Confucians to "return to the roots and innovate."

They believed that the cultures of the East and West should be viewed with equal eyes. They stood on the cultural position of national essence, based on traditional Confucianism (mainly Lu-Wang Heart Learning), and vigorously expounded the value of Chinese culture. They believed that Chinese culture takes the heart-mind as the source of all values. Traditional heart-mind learning is dominated by the theory of innate goodness. Heart-mind learning is the foundation of moral practice, which "generates practice through enlightenment and increases enlightenment through practice. Knowledge and action depend on each other and progress together." "Heart-mind learning is the essence of Chinese culture. Without understanding heart-mind learning, one cannot understand Chinese culture." Chinese ethics and morality have the basis of human inner spiritual life and the religious transcendental emotions it contains. Its moral practice advocates the harmony of heaven and man, the unity of heaven and man, which can make heaven and man interpenetrate, heaven is within man, and man communicates with heaven. The goal of Chinese logic is the completion of human moral personality. Chinese spiritual civilization is superior to the West, and Westerners should learn from Eastern culture. At the same time, they also analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of Chinese and Western cultures, explored the issue of the integration of Chinese and Western cultures, and made a prospect for the future culture of the world. They acknowledged that Chinese culture must accept Western or global culture and affirmed the scientific and democratic spirit of the West. They also gave a negative evaluation of the May Fourth Movement's criticism of traditional culture, believing that Marxism-Leninism is incompatible with Chinese national conditions.

In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the spiritual loss and emptiness brought by the highly developed Western capitalism, the success of the "Four Little Dragons" in Asia, and the spiritual value disintegration caused by China's "Cultural Revolution," Modern Neo-Confucians became more convinced of the correctness of their ideological direction and thus more active, initiating a wave of "Confucian revival." Their basic views were consistent with the Modern Neo-Confucianism since the 1950s, except that their attacks on Marxism-Leninism and the May Fourth Movement were more explicit and intense.

In recent years, with the questioning of the setbacks in social development since the founding of the People's Republic, the reflection on cultural authoritarianism during the "Cultural Revolution," and especially with the difficulties encountered in the deepening of reform and the influx of Western ideologies during the opening up, people have begun to explore the value and fate of traditional culture, especially its relationship with modernization. In this trend, the Modern Neo-Confucian trend has also spread to the mainland. In the fields of intellectual history, philosophy, and history, there is a growing tendency to evaluate traditional culture, especially Confucian thought, more highly, especially the views that negate the May Fourth Movement, negate Lu Xun, and denigrate the "cultural rupture" caused by the May Fourth Movement, which have become prevalent. The advocates of "Confucian revival" have found "kindred spirits" on the mainland and seem to have seen a glimmer of hope.

Five ideological characteristics of Modern Neo-Confucianism

Generally speaking, the Modern Neo-Confucian trend has the following characteristics:

1. A firm stance on national cultural essence. Emphasizing the "unity" and superiority of Chinese culture, affirming that Chinese culture has a living inner vitality, advocating taking the values of Chinese culture as the basic orientation, shaping personality, building society, and integrating Western culture.

2. A strong sense of "scattered flowers and fruits" of national culture, hoping that the whole nation can "identify" with the value of traditional culture and reach a "consensus" to promote Chinese culture.

3. Believing that Chinese culture has strong adaptability and assimilative power, which is not contradictory to modernization. It contains the idea of developing science and technology and the source of democratic politics. Believing that the middle way is superior to Western instruments, Western science and technology are indeed good, but they also bring a series of problems in thought and culture. Science and democracy without a foundation of thought and a self-adjusting mechanism of morality are rootless. Only Chinese culture can solve the problems of modern society and post-industrial civilization. The West should learn from Chinese culture.

4. Chinese and Western cultures can be integrated. Chinese culture should absorb scientific, democratic, and other thoughts from Western culture, making itself not only the subject of moral practice but also the "political subject." In the soil of Chinese culture, absorb the nutrients of Western culture, and cultivate modern Chinese culture.

5. Negating the ideological direction of the May Fourth Movement. Believing that the May Fourth Movement did more harm than good to Chinese culture, destroyed the inheritance of the "Dao" of Chinese scholarship and culture, and caused a rupture in national culture.

These characteristics reflect the value system and basic political stance of Modern Neo-Confucians.

In summary, the ideology of Modern Neo-Confucianism is worth our serious study, to be affirmed and rejected, and should not be simply denied or blindly advocated.

　　现代新儒学思潮
    ——由来、发展及思想特征
    李宗桂
    儒学发展三阶段：
    儒学——新儒学——现代新儒学
    现代新儒学是近年来在国内学术界和社会上流行的概念。有人认为，“现代新儒学，实质是海峡彼岸一批掌握了现代思想和方法的学者，在对中国近百年来‘现代化’不成功的历史经验的反省，以及对日本、新加坡等东方国家‘现代化’的成功经验所作的研究中形成的一种当代文化思潮”。有人认为，现代新儒学是指“抗日战争时期兴起的一种改造传统儒学的新思潮。……以中国传统文化为‘本体’，吸收西洋文化，以之为‘用具’，对传统的中国文化进行加工、制作、改造，使之成为一种既能保持中国的传统和特色，又能适合时代潮流和世界形势的新型文化”。有人认为，“现代新儒家是在本世纪２０年代产生的以接续儒家‘道统’为己任、以服膺宋明儒学为主要特征，力图用儒家学说融合、会通西学以谋求现代化的一个学术思想流派”。这几个定义各有其道理，我以为后者较为全面、准确、简练。
    现代新儒学是相对于先秦原始儒学和宋明新儒学而言的。一般认为，先秦以孔子、孟子和荀子为代表的儒学，是儒学发展的第一阶段，称为原始儒学。经过宋明时期援佛入儒，对儒学进行改造，使儒学哲理化，是儒学发展的第二阶段。这一时期的儒学被称为新儒学，其哲学家被称为新儒家。海外学者已习惯用这种指称。“五四”前后，一批知识分子面对中国传统伦理和价值系统的崩溃，帝国主义文化的入侵和马列主义在中国的传播，欲图恢复传统文化的地位和价值系统，弘扬儒学，以适应时代潮流，是儒学发展的第三阶段，即时人所称的现代新儒学。代表这一社会文化思潮的有独立思想体系的学者，被人们称为现代新儒家，以区别于宋明新儒学和新儒家。
    现代新儒学先驱：
    梁漱溟、熊十力、贺麟、冯友兰
    十九世纪下半叶以来，中国政治、经济、军事和社会状况日益恶化。西方列强将种种屈辱强加于中华民族，中国反抗列强侵略斗争屡遭挫折。在思想文化方面，西风东渐，传统伦理观念和价值系统分崩离析，中国在从传统走向现代的进程中，步履维艰。如何认识中国传统文化的价值和未来的命运，迎接西方文化的挑战，找到一条从传统走向现代的正确道路，成为一代知识分子苦苦思虑的重大现实问题。这时期，各种思想学术流派应运而生：国粹主义派，中体西用派，全盘西化派，不一而足。其中，以梁漱溟、张君劢、冯友兰、贺麟、熊十力等为代表的知识分子，推崇中国传统文化的基本精神和价值系统，自本世纪２０年代起，力图在中西文化冲突、传统与现代的冲突中，保持中国传统文化的本体和主导地位，并以此为基础来会通西学、融合中西，以回应西方文化的挑战和马克思主义的冲击。这些知识分子便是我们所说的现代新儒家，他们所代表的社会思潮和学术文化思潮，便是现代新儒学思潮。
    梁漱溟是现代新儒学的先驱。早在１９２１年，他就出版了《东西文化及其哲学》一书。他认为，东西文化差异在于“人生路向”上的根本不同。他以“意欲”向前、向后、持中为标准，将西方、印度、中国三大文化系统归结为三条不同的路向，认为只有以儒家思想为基本价值取向的生活，才能使人尝到“人生的真味”，因而儒家思想才是人类文化的理想归宿，“世界未来文化就是中国文化的复兴”。在五四运动反儒学、反传统的高潮时期中，他就公开高举儒家旗帜，提倡孔学，鼓吹“走孔家的路”，除了“替孔子去发挥外，更不作旁的事”。
    熊十力早年参加辛亥革命，中年崇信佛学，推崇法相唯识之学，后由佛归儒，以《易传》为宗，独创“新唯识论”的哲学体系。他认为“五四”以后，人们对西方科学技术的追求，实际只是情绪化地执著于西方思想的皮毛，是盲目崇拜西方的心态作祟。他要求对西方的认识必须与中国价值系统的重建相辅而行，即须先建立中国文化之“体”，而他的哲学就是从本体论上为此而作的努力。
    贺麟倡导的是“新心学”。“新心学”是西方新黑格尔主义和中国陆王心学相结合的产物。贺麟对国粹主义和全盘西化的观念都持否定态度。他于１９４１年８月，在《思想与时代》杂志上发表了《儒家思想的新开展》一文，第一次提出了我们现在所说的“现代新儒学”意义上的“新儒学”概念，并对新儒学的思想观点作了详细系统的阐述。这篇文章被看作现代新儒学的代表作。在文中，他明确提出了“以儒家思想为本体，以西洋文化为用具”的主张。他认为，数千年来，儒家思想在其发展过程中，不断得到改造，总是能够适应新的时代精神。根据对中国现代文化动向和思想趋向的考察，他断言，新儒学是中国现代思潮的主流，现实社会正在“蔚成一个新儒学运动”。他认为，“民族复兴，从本质上说，应该是民族文化的复兴，儒家文化的复兴”。他主张输入与把握西方文化，以充实儒家思想。中华民族精神和文化的生死存亡，取决于能否把西方文化儒化、华化、中国化。“中国文化能否复兴的问题，亦即将西洋文化中国化是否可能，以民族精神为体，以西洋文化为用是否可能的问题。”
    冯友兰提倡的是“新理学”。他在抗战时期写了《新理学》、《新事论》、《新世训》、《新原人》、《新原道》、《新知言》等“贞元六书”，集中宣传了他的“接近于程朱道学的那套思想”。他公开声明，他的新理学是“接着”宋明理学讲的，而不是“照着”讲的。所谓“新”，在于他以程朱道学为正宗，吸收西方哲学，主要是用新实在论的逻辑分析方法，研究中国传统哲学，改铸宋明理学，把新实在论与程朱道学融合起来，形成一个新的形而上学思想体系。
    一般说来，以上梁、熊、贺、冯四位所代表的社会和学术文化思潮，是现代新儒学发展的前期阶段。解放以后，现代新儒学思潮，在大陆基本上处于销声匿迹的状态，主要转移到了港台地区，并得到了新的发展。
    ５０年代后港台新儒学代表人物：
    唐君毅、牟宗三、徐复观、钱穆
    ５０年代，以唐君毅、牟宗三、徐复观、钱穆等人为代表的港台现代新儒家，著书立说，发表演说，奔波于亚欧美三大洲，宣扬以儒学为核心的中国传统文化的价值系统，弘扬传统儒学。他们用西方哲学的方法对中国文化进行解析，用现代西方社会的弊端对照中国文化的长处，同时主张采纳西方文化中的某些积极因素，以重新建构中国本位文化。其中，最有代表性的是由唐君毅执笔，牟宗三、徐复观、张君劢共同署名，轰动一时的文化宣言：《为中国文化敬告世界人士宣言》（副题是：《我们对中国学术研究及中国文化与世界文化前途之共同认识》）。“宣言”系统阐述了他们对中国文化的过去、现在和未来，以及中西文化关系等问题的基本立场和观点，提出了现代新儒家“返本开新”的思想纲领。
    他们认为，现时东西文化应以平等眼光看待对方。他们站在民族本位的文化立场上，依据传统儒学（主要是陆王心学），竭力阐扬中国文化的价值。他们认为，中国文化以心性为一切价值的根源。传统的心性之学以性善论为主流。心性之学是人的道德实践的基础，它“依觉悟而生实践，依实践而更增觉悟，知行二者相依而进”。“心性之学，乃中国文化之神髓所在”，“不了解心性之学，即不了解中国文化”。中国伦理道德有人的内心精神生活的根据，及其所包括的宗教性的超越感情。其人生道德实践主张天人合德、天人合一，能使天人交贯，天内在于人，人上通于天。中国的义理之学，目标在于人的道德人格的完成。中国精神文明高于西方，西方人应向东方文化学习。同时，他们也剖析了中西文化各自的优缺点，探讨了中西文化的结合问题，并对世界未来文化作了展望。他们承认，中国文化必须接受西方或世界之文化，肯定西方的科学和民主精神。他们还对五四运动对传统文化的批判，作了否定性的评价，认为马列主义与中国国情不相容。
    六七十年代，由于西方资本主义高度发达而带来了精神上的失落感、空虚感，由于亚洲“四小龙”的成功，由于中国“文化大革命”而造成的精神价值的解体，使现代新儒家们更坚信其思想方向之正确，因而更加活跃，掀起了“儒家复兴”的波澜。其基本观点与５０年代以来的现代新儒学是同一思想方向，只不过对马克思主义和五四运动的攻击更加明显激烈而已。
    近几年来，随着人们对建国以来的社会发展屡遭挫折、经济建设落于人后的诘难，随着人们对“文革”中文化专制的反思，特别是随着改革深化过程中出现的种种磨难，开放过程中西方思潮的涌入，引发了人们对传统文化的价值、命运，尤其是和现代化的关系的探讨。在这股潮流中，现代新儒学思潮也播散到了大陆。思想史界、哲学史界以及历史学界，都有对传统文化特别是儒家思想评价越来越高的倾向，特别是否定五四运动、否定鲁迅，诋毁五四运动造成了“文化断层”的观点，也大行其道。“儒学复兴”的倡导者们在大陆找到了“知音”，似乎看见了一线希望的曙光。
    现代新儒学：
    五个思想特征
    大致说来，现代新儒学思潮具有如下特征：
    一、有着坚定的民族文化本位立场。强调中国文化的“一本性”和优越性，肯定中国文化有活的内在生命力，主张以中国文化的价值为基本取向，塑造人格，建设社会，融合西方文化。
    二、有强烈的民族文化“花果飘零”的心态，希望全民能对传统文化的价值“认同”，取得“共识”，以弘扬中国文化。
    三、认为中国文化具有很强的适用性和同化力，与现代化并不相矛盾，本身蕴含着发展科技的思想，包含着民主政治的根源。认为中道高于西器，西方科技固然好，但也带来了思想文化上的一系列弊端，而没有思想根基和道德自我调适机制的科技、民主，是无本之末。只有中国文化才能解决现代社会以及后工业文明的问题，西方应向中国文化学习。
    四、中西文化可以融合。中国文化应吸纳西方文化中的科学、民主等思想，使自己不仅成为道德实践的主体，而且成为“政治的主体”。在中国文化的土壤中，吸收西方文化的养料，培养出现代意义的中国文化。
    五、否定五四运动的思想方向。认为五四运动对中国文化的破坏多于建设，破坏了中国学术文化“道统”的继承，造成了民族文化的断层。
    这些特点，反映了现代新儒家们的价值体系和基本政治立场。
    总之，现代新儒学的思想，值得我们认真研究，加以扬弃，而不应简单否定，或者盲目倡和。
