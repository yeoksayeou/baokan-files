Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 8th.

The latest statistics provided by China Customs indicate that in 1988, the export value of China's joint ventures, foreign-owned, and cooperatively-owned enterprises (referred to as "three-resource enterprises") reached $24.16 billion, an increase of over 70% compared to the previous year.

Of the total export value, 77.5% came from processing trade, amounting to $19.07 billion. Exports using domestic materials accounted for $4.66 billion, or 18.9%.

Approximately half of the exported goods were mechanical and electrical products, while textiles and garments made up about a quarter. Other significant export items included tape recorders, stereo systems, electric fans, calculators, watches, jewelry, toys, and shoes. The production bases for these export products were mainly located along the coast, with Guangdong accounting for about 80% and Fujian around 10%. The four special economic zones of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, and Xiamen had "three-resource" enterprises that exported $1.02 billion in 1988, accounting for 42% of the total export value of "three-resource" enterprises. The primary export destinations for these products were Hong Kong, followed by Japan and the United States.

According to data from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, by the end of last year, China had approved the establishment of nearly 16,000 "three-resource" enterprises, with approximately 7,000 of them already in operation or production.
