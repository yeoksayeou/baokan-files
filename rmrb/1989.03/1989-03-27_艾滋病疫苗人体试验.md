The first person to receive an AIDS vaccine and survive has shown an immune response to the virus. This person is the French doctor Daniel Zagury.

On one day in November 1986, Dr. Zagury intentionally cut his own skin and injected a type of AIDS vaccine he had been researching. He used genetic engineering technology to combine an AIDS virus with the smallpox virus to create the vaccine. Then, he introduced this vaccine into his body to test whether his immune system would be infected.

Two months after the first vaccine injection, a miracle occurred. The French doctor discovered through a blood test that this combined virus vaccine could induce a strong cellular immune response, thereby producing a powerful AIDS virus antibody in his body, preventing his immune system from being reinfected and controlling the spread of the virus. So far, his body has shown no adverse reactions. His spirit of dedication to conquering AIDS has been widely praised.

Researchers at the French National Cancer Institute said the next step in the research is to vaccinate chimpanzees and then infect them with the AIDS virus to observe whether they have immunity.

Currently, many countries are accelerating the development of an AIDS vaccine. Britain has decided to grant the AIDS vaccine research wartime powers. St. Stephen's Hospital in London has developed an AIDS vaccine. According to a report in _The Times_ last year, this AIDS vaccine is based on a synthetic protein called HGP-30. Researchers said that after successful trials on the first batch of volunteers, they will conduct more extensive trials among groups at high risk of AIDS infection, such as homosexuals and drug abusers.

In 1988, an American doctor developed an AIDS vaccine and conducted trials on nine people who were at risk of developing AIDS. Later, he conducted trials on 54 people who were already infected with the AIDS virus. The result was that these people did not develop into AIDS patients.

The doctor believed that the vaccine has a strong inhibitory effect on AIDS. This vaccine can simulate antibodies to resist the already formed AIDS virus, including injecting into the human body the AIDS virus that has been killed and treated with radiation, and stripped of its protein shell. Scientists believe that if this research progresses smoothly, the performance of this vaccine can become stable. After the human body is injected with this vaccine, it will produce an antibody that specifically destroys the internal structure of the AIDS virus, thereby killing this virus.

Experts estimate that after a few more years of trials, the AIDS vaccine can be used in clinical practice, thereby effectively curbing the spread of the AIDS virus.

### 艾滋病疫苗人体试验

　　艾滋病疫苗人体试验
    第一个注射艾滋病疫苗而存活的人，已呈现出对病毒的免疫反应。这个人是法国医生丹尼尔·扎格瑞。
    １９８６年１１月的一天，扎格瑞医生划破自己的皮肤，注入他研究的一种艾滋病疫苗。他应用基因工程技术，将一种艾滋病病毒与天花病病毒组合后制成疫苗。然后，他把这种疫苗渗入体内，试一试他自身免疫系统是否受到感染。
    注射第一种疫苗后两个月，奇迹出现了。这位法国医生通过血液检查发现，这种组合病毒制成的疫苗，能够引发一种强有力的细胞传递的免疫反应，从而使他体内产生了极强的艾滋病病毒抗体，使他的免疫系统不受复发感染，以控制病毒的蔓延。迄今为止，他的身体尚未出现不适反应。他为攻克艾滋病而献身的精神受到广泛的赞誉。
    法国国家肿瘤研究院的研究人员说，研究工作的下一步是，给黑猩猩接种疫苗，再使它们受艾滋病病毒感染，观察它们是否有免疫能力。
    目前，许多国家加紧研制艾滋病疫苗。英国决定给艾滋病疫苗研究以战时权力。伦敦圣斯蒂芬斯医院已研制出一种艾滋病疫苗。据《泰晤士报》去年报道，这种艾滋病疫苗是以叫做ＨＧＰ—３０的人造蛋白为基础制成的。研究人员说，在第一批志愿者身上进行试验成功后，将在容易感染艾滋病毒的人群如同性恋者和滥用毒品者当中进行更为广泛的试验。
    １９８８年，美国一位医生试制成一种艾滋病疫苗，并在９个可能发生艾滋病的人身上做了试验。其后，他又对５４个已感染艾滋病病毒的人进行试验。结果，这些人没有发展为艾滋病患者。
    这位医生认为，该疫苗对艾滋病具有较强的抑制作用。这种疫苗可以模拟抗体反抗已经形成的艾滋病病毒，包括向人体内注射已经被杀死并经过放射处理、剥光其蛋白质外皮的艾滋病病毒。科学家们认为，如果这项研究进展顺利，这种疫苗的性能可以趋向稳定，人体注射这种疫苗后，将会产生一种专门破坏艾滋病病毒内部结构的抗体，从而将这种病毒杀死。
    专家们估计，再过几年的试验，艾滋病疫苗可望用于临床实践，从而有力地遏制艾滋病病毒的传播。
