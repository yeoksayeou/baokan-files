The second session of the Seventh National People's Congress opens today in Beijing. This is a crucial meeting held at a time when rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform are underway. The session will review the government work report and other reports, as well as drafts of the Administrative Litigation Law and the Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress. It is a meeting that has attracted both domestic and international attention. We extend our warm congratulations to the congress!

The past year was an unforgettable one. It marked the 10th year of China's reform and opening up, a year of continued progress in the modernization of socialism, and a year when significant inflation and excessive price increases led to the implementation of the policy of rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform. After nearly half a year of intense work, the policy of rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform has begun to show results. The overheating of the economy has started to cool down, and the upward trend in prices has been somewhat curbed. The broad masses of the people believe that as long as we continue to steadfastly implement this policy, the difficulties on the road ahead can be overcome, and a new order for socialist commodity economy can gradually be established.

Like many profound social changes in the world, the reform we are undertaking in the primary stage of socialism must inevitably go through a long process from shallow to deep and from easy to difficult. In the initial stage, the focus of reform is on the most prominent and superficial problems in the old system, making it relatively easy to achieve noticeable results in a short period. However, as the reform expands and deepens, it inevitably encounters the deep-seated and complex contradictions within the old system, making the difficulties and risks of reform tenfold or even a hundredfold greater. The question is whether we will press on despite the difficulties or retreat in the face of them. This is a stern test from history. When reform is sailing smoothly and making rapid progress, it is easy to hear unanimous praise; but when encountering certain difficulties and twists, various opinions will inevitably arise. This is not surprising. The key is that all those who strive for the Four Modernizations and the rejuvenation of China must have a clear understanding of the historical trend, a firm belief in the basic line of the party in the primary stage of socialism, and sufficient confidence in the future of reform. We must not be swayed by various wrong opinions.

The great achievements made since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and the initial results of rectification and adjustment since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee have undoubtedly enhanced the prestige of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council. However, high trust in the party and government does not mean being silent about the shortcomings and mistakes in leadership work; having confidence in the future of reform and opening up does not mean avoiding the problems that arise on the road ahead. Loving the people, being loyal to the people, seeking truth from facts, and daring to speak out are the necessary qualities for people's representatives to exercise the powers granted by the constitution and laws. Nearly 3,000 deputies from all over the country, with the 11 billion people of all ethnic groups, share the same breath. They have a deep understanding of the great achievements of the 10-year reform, a true understanding of the difficulties and problems encountered in the process, and many insightful views on overcoming difficulties and removing obstacles. The annual session of the National People's Congress is the best platform for expressing the voices of the people of all ethnic groups and strata; it is also an excellent opportunity to mobilize and inspire the people of the whole country to participate in the arduous task of rectification and adjustment, deepening reform, and enhancing cohesion and unity. Current hot topics among the people, such as price issues, agricultural issues, education issues, and corruption issues, can all be discussed during the review of the government work report, and constructive criticism and suggestions can be put forward. Through the exchange of different opinions, we can certainly make the measures for rectification and adjustment more thorough and better achieve the goals set by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has made important contributions to the implementation of the policy of rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform. Over the past year, the Standing Committee has repeatedly listened to the work reports of the State Council and relevant departments, and has put forward many valuable opinions and suggestions. After the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the Standing Committee adopted the "Decision on Strengthening Democracy and the Legal System to Maintain Stability and Unity and Ensure the Smooth Progress of Reform and Construction," which promoted the progress of rectification and adjustment work. To better adapt to the new situation of reform and opening up and socialist construction, the Standing Committee has made several improvements to its own work, strengthened legislative work and supervision of the implementation of laws, strengthened the construction of work systems, improved the openness of work, and further strengthened its ties with deputies to the National People's Congress, local people's congresses, and the people. The new progress in the work of the Standing Committee reflects, to some extent, that under the conditions of rectification and adjustment, the construction of socialist democratic politics in our country is proceeding in an orderly and steady manner. The Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress to be reviewed at this session will further institutionalize the work of the people's congresses and their standing committees. The Administrative Litigation Law to be reviewed at this session will further provide legal protection for the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and organizations.

The people of all ethnic groups in the country have high expectations for the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress. The representatives bear heavy responsibilities. All representatives should fulfill their duties, work together, speak freely, and pool their wisdom. They will certainly make this session a great meeting that boosts morale and strengthens confidence, and a meeting that promotes rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform.

　　共商治理整顿深化改革大计
    ——祝贺七届全国人大二次会议开幕
    第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议今天在北京开幕。这是在治理整顿、深化改革的关键时刻召开的一次会议。这次会议将审议政府工作报告和其他报告，审议行政诉讼法和全国人民代表大会议事规则等法律草案，是国内外瞩目的会议。我们向大会致以热烈的祝贺！
    过去的一年是难忘的一年，是我国实行改革开放的第１０年，是社会主义现代化事业继续前进的一年，也是出现明显的通货膨胀、物价上涨幅度过大，开始实行治理整顿、深化改革方针的一年。经过近半年紧张的工作，治理整顿、深化改革的方针已初见成效，经济过热开始降温，物价上涨势头有所减弱。广大人民群众相信，只要继续坚定不移地贯彻这个方针，前进道路上的困难是可以克服的，社会主义商品经济的新秩序一定能够逐步建立起来。
    同世界上很多深刻的社会变革一样，我们正在进行的社会主义初级阶段的改革也必然经历一个由浅入深、从易到难的长过程。在初始阶段，改革的锋芒所向是旧体制中弊端最突出又最浅层的部分，因而易于在较短时间内取得明显成效。但是随着改革的扩展和深入，不可避免地触及旧体制中深层的盘根错节的矛盾时，改革的难度和风险就十倍百倍地增大了。是知难而进，还是知难而退，这是历史对我们的严峻考验。当改革轻扬风帆、高歌猛进之时，不难听到众口一词的赞誉；而当遇到某些困难和曲折，需要进行必要的调整时，这样那样的议论也会纷至沓来。这并不奇怪。问题在于，一切立志为实现四化、振兴中华而奋斗的人们，对历史发展的大趋势要有明确的认识，对党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线要有坚定的信念，对改革的前途要有充分的信心，决不能为各种错误的意见所动摇。
    党的十一届三中全会以来所取得的巨大成就，十三届三中全会以来治理整顿的初步成果，提高了党中央、国务院的威望，这是毫无疑义的。但是，对党和政府的高度信赖，并不是对领导工作的缺点和失误噤若寒蝉；对改革开放的前途充满信心，也不是对前进道路上出现的问题讳莫如深。热爱人民，忠于人民，实事求是，敢于直言，这是人民代表行使宪法和法律赋予的职权所必需的品格。来自祖国四面八方的近３０００位全国人大代表，与１１亿各族人民呼吸相通，对１０年改革的巨大成就有深切的感受，对前进中的困难和问题有真切的了解，对克服困难、排除障碍也有很多真知灼见。一年一次的全国人大会议，正是把各族各阶层人民的心声表达出来的最好讲坛；也是动员和鼓舞全国人民共同参与治理整顿、深化改革的艰巨任务，增强向心力、凝聚力的极好机会。当前人民群众最热门的话题，例如物价问题、农业问题、教育问题、廉政问题等等，在审议政府工作报告的时候，都可以展开讨论，提出建设性的批评意见，出主意，想办法。通过不同意见的相互磋商，一定可以把治理整顿的措施搞得更周密，更好地实现党的十三届三中全会提出的目标。
    为实现治理整顿、深化改革的方针，全国人大常委会做出了重要贡献。一年来，全国人大常委会多次听取国务院及有关部委的工作汇报，提出很多宝贵的意见和建议。党的十三届三中全会后，人大常委会作出《关于加强民主法制维护安定团结保障改革和建设顺利进行的决定》，推动了治理整顿工作的进展。为了更好地适应改革开放和社会主义建设的新形势，全国人大常委会对自身的工作进行了若干改进，加强了立法工作和对法律实施的监督，加强了工作制度的建设，提高了工作的开放程度，进一步密切了同全国人大代表、地方人大和人民群众的联系。全国人大常委会工作的新进展，从一个方面反映出在治理整顿的条件下，我国社会主义民主政治的建设正在有条不紊地、稳步扎实地前进。这次会议将要审议的全国人民代表大会议事规则，将使人大及其常委会的工作进一步制度化。这次会议将要审议的行政诉讼法，将使公民和组织的合法权益进一步得到法律的有力保障。
    全国各族人民对七届全国人大二次会议寄予厚望。人民代表，重任在肩。全体代表克尽职守，共同努力，畅所欲言，集思广益，一定能把这次会议开成一个振奋精神、增强信心的大会，推动治理整顿、深化改革的大会。
