Today, we invite them to observe our session. Now, the guests have taken their seats in the foreign guests' section on the second floor. On behalf of the presidium and all the representatives, please allow me to extend a warm welcome to Speaker Dennis Yang and the entire delegation. At this moment, the hall erupted in warm applause.

	The four major tasks to be completed for the 1989 macro-control target

	Yao Yilin made the report on behalf of the State Council. He said that in 1988, the gross national product reached 1,385.3 billion yuan, an 11.2% increase over the previous year in comparable prices; national income reached 1,153.3 billion yuan, an 11.4% increase over the previous year in comparable prices.

	He said that the macro-control targets for the 1989 plan are:

		— Maintain a moderate economic growth rate. Agricultural production will increase by 4% over the previous year; industrial production will increase by 8%; gross national product will increase by 7.5%.

		— The total fixed asset investment for the entire society will be reduced by more than 20% compared to the previous year, and the investment structure will be further improved according to the state's industrial policy.

		— The national budget deficit and the amount of currency issued will both be lower than the previous year.

		— By effectively controlling demand and increasing and improving effective supply, the national retail price index will have a significantly lower increase than the previous year.

	Yao Yilin said that the main tasks for the 1989 plan include: resolutely reducing the scale of fixed asset investment and adjusting the investment structure; controlling the rapid growth of consumption demand and gradually easing the contradictions of social distribution inequality; striving for significant increases in agricultural production, especially in grain, cotton, and oilseed production; lowering the excessively high industrial growth rate and seriously adjusting the production structure; properly adjusting the import and export commodity structure and further expanding foreign economic cooperation and technological exchanges; further developing science, technology, education, and cultural, health, and sports undertakings.

	He pointed out that the main tasks for economic system reform in 1989 are: further improving and developing the enterprise contract responsibility system; vigorously rectifying the economic order, especially the circulation order, and promoting the construction of a new socialist commodity economic order; and strengthening and improving macro-economic control.

	The 1989 national budget deficit is 7.4 billion yuan, advocating hard work and doing a good job in increasing production and saving

	Wang Boqian, in his report on behalf of the State Council, first introduced the execution situation of the 1988 national budget. He said that overall, the execution of the 1988 budget was relatively good. According to the current estimated figures, the national financial revenue for 1988 was 258.782 billion yuan, and the national financial expenditure was 266.831 billion yuan. After deducting revenue and expenditure, the financial deficit was 8.049 billion yuan. These estimated figures will change somewhat after the national final accounts are compiled, but it is estimated that the deficit amount will not exceed the budget.

	Regarding the draft of the 1989 national budget, Wang Boqian said that the draft of the 1989 national budget now submitted for deliberation has a total financial revenue of 285.68 billion yuan, an increase of 10.4% over the estimated execution amount of the previous year; the total financial expenditure is 293.08 billion yuan, an increase of 9.8% over the estimated execution amount of the previous year; after deducting revenue and expenditure, the expenditure exceeds the revenue by 7.4 billion yuan, a reduction of 6.49 billion yuan compared to the estimated deficit of the previous year.

	Wang Boqian pointed out that to ensure the completion of the 1989 national budget, all regions and departments must have a unified understanding, consider the overall situation, carry forward the spirit of hard work and frugality, and combine the rectification, rectification, and reform with the movement of increasing production and saving, and do a solid job in all aspects.

	He proposed that this year, the movement of increasing production and saving, increasing revenue and saving expenditure should be continued to ensure the stable growth of financial revenue; open up financial resources, concentrate funds, and organize various revenues; control financial expenditure, reduce the purchasing power of social groups; deepen financial and tax reforms, improve the enterprise contract responsibility system and various forms of financial contracts implemented for local areas; strengthen budget management, and strictly enforce financial discipline.
