Gorbachev: Initial Steps in Conventional Arms Reduction

Last December, Soviet leader Gorbachev announced at the United Nations that the Soviet Union would reduce its military by 500,000 troops and a significant number of conventional weapons within two years. This year, the Soviet Union further announced a 14.2% reduction in military spending. These two major military reductions by the Soviet Union have sparked strong reactions from various quarters.

Three Distinct Notes

The Soviet Union's decision to reduce its military forces initially sounds like a sharp crack, but upon closer examination, it reveals three distinct notes. The first note is "unilateral reduction"—unlike other countries that negotiate and bargain, the Soviet Union is making a unilateral decision. The second note is "significant reduction"—reducing by 500,000 troops, which accounts for 12% of the total Soviet military, and also significantly reducing the number of conventional weapons, including 10,000 tanks, 8,500 artillery pieces, and 800 fighter jets deployed in the European part of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. The third note is "comprehensive reduction"—reducing troops in the Western, Far Eastern, and Southern theaters by 240,000, 200,000, and 60,000 respectively. Following the Soviet Union, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and other countries have also announced military reductions and cuts in military spending. This series of military reduction actions indeed gives one a sense of being overwhelmed.

Three Birds with One Stone

Currently, military reduction is a major issue in the realm of national security strategy, involving the intersection of politics, diplomacy, and military affairs. Gorbachev's move aims to achieve three goals.

Firstly, to promote domestic reforms. The Soviet Union's reforms have been ongoing for over three years, but the economy has not shown significant improvement. Last year's economic growth rate was likely less than 1%. One of the main reasons is that the military is too large, with annual military spending actually reaching over $200 billion, accounting for 16% to 18% of the gross national product and about one-third of government expenditures. Gorbachev seems intent on changing the decades-old policy of "guns before butter" to see results from the reforms as soon as possible.

Secondly, to further open up the diplomatic front. Withdrawing troops from Eastern Europe can reduce Western Europe's suspicions of the Soviet Union; reducing troops in the Far East is intended to create a good atmosphere for the upcoming Sino-Soviet summit; and for the new U.S. President Bush, this is to show that the Soviet Union is willing to push forward arms reduction talks and maintain a détente.

Thirdly, to implement military strategic adjustments. The Soviet Union claims that its security concept has shifted from absolute security for itself to "considering the security of others and mutual security and trust." Military buildup has also shifted from the past "the more the better" to "maintaining a reasonable and sufficient level." Additionally, within just two months, about 20 high-ranking generals, including army commanders, have had their positions adjusted, with the 50-year-old Marshal Moiseyev replacing Marshal Akhromeyev as the Chief of the General Staff being the most notable, strengthening the forces supporting reform. No wonder the public opinion calls Gorbachev's military reduction decision a brilliant move.

Three Movements from One Action

Internationally, Gorbachev's military reduction decision has had the effect of pulling one string and moving three parts:

First, it has stirred up enthusiasm in Western European countries. The leaders of Western European countries have expressed welcome for this, but at the same time, they have pointed out the fact that the Soviet Union still maintains a conventional force advantage after the reduction. On March 6, the 23 member countries of NATO and the Warsaw Pact began negotiations on European armed forces, and both sides have reached preliminary agreements on the principles, projects, and regions of reduction. Some people believe that under the current political climate, the prospects for conventional arms reduction are good.

Second, it has touched the "sensitive nerves" of the United States. Europe is the strategic focus of the U.S.-Soviet competition. The United States believes that the Soviet Union's strategic goal is to drive it out of Europe, so it has been trying every means to drive a wedge between the U.S. and Europe. The United States feels that under the Soviet Union's peace offensive, Western Europe is a bit too enthusiastic and even naive about the Soviet Union. West Germany openly defied the United States on the issue of modernizing short-range missiles, and Western European countries lent about $100 billion to the Soviet Union last year. In this situation, the United States wants to give the U.S.-Soviet relationship a "cool treatment." Bush announced that he would use three months to review the policy. The United States, from a geopolitical perspective, believes that no matter how the Soviet Union changes, it will always be the United States' strongest rival. Moreover, it has doubts about the prospects of Gorbachev's reforms. Therefore, the U.S. and Europe still have a lot of hard work to do in coordinating their policies towards the Soviet Union.

Third, it has pushed the world situation to continue developing in the direction of détente. The Soviet Union's unilateral military reduction decision is in line with the overall trend of dialogue replacing confrontation, and objectively benefits world peace and development. If the Soviet Union can continue in this direction, it will naturally receive welcome from people.

### 戈尔巴乔夫：常规裁军初试刀

　　戈尔巴乔夫：常规裁军初试刀
    去年底，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫在联大宣布，苏联将在两年内裁减军队５０万和大量常规武器。今年初，苏又宣布削减军费１４．２％。苏联这两个裁军大动作，引起了各方强烈反响。
    一响三音
    苏联的裁军决定乍听是一声脆响，细辨则有三音。第一音为“单方面裁”——不同其它任何国家讨价还价，自家“一口清”。第二音为“大幅度裁”——裁减５０万，占苏军总数的１２％，同时还将“大大减少常规武器数量”，其中包括部署在苏欧洲部分和东欧国家的１万辆坦克，８５００门大炮和８００架战斗机。第三音为“全方位裁”——在西部战区，远东战区和南方战区分别裁减２４万、２０万和６万兵员。继苏联之后，匈牙利、波兰、民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚等国也纷纷宣布裁军，削减军费。这一叠连串的裁军行动，的确给人以目不暇接之感。
    一石三鸟
    在当前，裁军是国家安全战略范畴内的重头戏，是政治、外交、军事三者交叉的敏感领域。戈尔巴乔夫出一石，意在三鸟。
    首先，推动国内改革。苏联改革３年多，经济尚无多大起色。去年经济增长率实际上可能还不足１％。其重要原因之一是军队过于庞大，军费实际开支每年高达２０００多亿美元，占国民生产总值１６％至１８％，占政府财政支出约１／３。戈尔巴乔夫似有意，要改变一下几十年来“先大炮后黄油”的基本方针，使改革尽早见成果。
    其次，进一步打开外交局。从东欧撤军可减少西欧对苏的疑虑；削减远东驻军，意在给将要举行的中苏首脑会晤创造良好气氛；而对于美国新总统布什，这是要表明苏联愿意推进裁军谈判，保持缓和势头。
    第三，落实军事战略调整。苏联宣称它的安全概念已由过去绝对确保己方安全，变为“同时考虑对方安全和与对方的共同安全及相互信任”。军备建设也从过去的多多益善变为“保持合理足够水平”。另外，仅仅两个月之内，就有约２０名军区司令以上的高级将领调整了职务，其中年仅５０岁的莫伊谢耶夫上将接替阿赫罗梅耶夫元帅出任苏军总参谋长最引人注目，增强了支持改革的力量，难怪舆论把戈尔巴乔夫这一裁军决定称为一着妙棋。
    一发三动
    从国际上看，戈尔巴乔夫的裁军决定起到了牵一发而动三方的效果：
　　第一，它激起了西欧国家的热情。西欧各国首脑对此表示欢迎，但同时又指出了苏联裁军后仍占有常规力量优势的事实。３月６日，北约和华约的２３个成员国开始举行欧洲武装力量谈判，双方已就裁减的原则、项目、地域等达成初步协议。有人认为，在目前政治气候下，常规裁军前景看好。
    第二，它触动了美国的“敏感神经”。欧洲是美苏争夺的战略重点。美国认为，苏联的战略目标是要把它挤出欧洲，于是千方百计地离间美欧关系。美国觉得，在苏联和平攻势下，西欧对苏联有点过份热情甚至轻信。西德在短程导弹现代化问题上公然与美国顶牛，西欧国家去年给苏联的贷款约百亿美元，在这种情况下，美国想对苏美关系先来个“冷处理”。布什宣布要用３个月的时间进行政策复审。美国从地缘政治角度认定，苏联不论怎么变，总是美国最强劲的对手。再说，它对戈尔巴乔夫改革的前景也心存疑虑。所以，美欧在协调对苏政策方面还有艰苦的工作要做。
    第三，它推动了世界局势继续向缓和方向发展。苏联单方面裁军的决定符合对话代替对抗的总趋势，客观上有利于世界的和平与发展。如果苏联能循此方向继续走下去，自然会受到人们的欢迎。
