Author: Lingnan
Date: 1989-03-10
Edition: 4

The editor-in-chief of "The People's Literature," Liu Xinwu, wrote in the January issue of this year, stating that the journal would take contemporaneity, pioneering spirit, and exchange as its guiding principles. He also announced that three special issues would be planned for the year, aiming to showcase the diverse landscape of literary creation and the development of literature. Recently, the special issue on novels has been compiled and will be released in late March.

This special issue features a collection of short stories by renowned authors. Wang Meng's "Early Spring Rondo," Zhang Jie's "The Last Height," and Lin Jinlian's "Misty" each have distinct styles and unique charms. Feng Deying, known for his long novels, also contributes a short story titled "Xixiaodi" to add variety to the issue.

Three young authors who have been innovative in recent years are making their debut in "The People's Literature" for the first time. Yu Hua's "Blood and Plum Blossoms," Su Tong's "Completion of the Ritual," and Ge Fei's "Harmonium" are both legendary and full of modern vibes.

Promoting new literary talents is a long-standing mission of "The People's Literature." The authors of the novels in this special issue are mostly emerging writers. Following the publication of Cha Jianying's novella "Ice River Under the Jungle" in the 11th issue last year, this issue features her short story "Requiem for Rosa and Joe." Yang Jianmin's "Temptation" is the debut work of a 20-year-old from Jiangxi Province. Additionally, there are "Northwest Black Man" by Lei Jianzheng from the Northwest and "Critical Point" by Li Wei from the Northeast.

If classified by themes and styles, the novels in this issue can be titled with various names such as realism, modernity, supernatural, martial arts, history, romance, and more, making it quite interesting. To complement the creative works, the special issue includes four theoretical and critical columns: "Literary Roundtable," "Dialogue and Implicit Dialogue," and others, focusing on discussions around novels. Tang Dao's discussion on artistic forms is insightful; the "Novelists' Voices" column invites the authors of this issue to share their views, adding to the readers' interest.

　　《人民文学》推出专号展示小说创作现状
    本报讯  《人民文学》主编刘心武，在该刊今年元月号上，曾经撰文表明，将以时代性、开拓性、交流性作为编刊经纬，并预告今年拟出三个专号，通过多元的创作景象，展示文学的发展态势。日前，小说专号已编就绪，即于３月下旬面世。
    这一期专号集中发表了一组名家的短篇力作。王蒙的《初春回旋曲》，张洁的《最后的高度》，林斤澜的《氤氲》，风格迥异，各具魅力。专事长篇的冯德英，也以其《西小地》为短篇增添花色。
    近年锐意创新的三位新生代作家，而今同时在《人民文学》上头一回“亮相”。余华的《鲜血梅花》，苏童的《仪式的完成》，格非的《风琴》，既有传奇色采，又富新潮气韵。
    大力推举文学新人是《人民文学》一贯宗旨，专号上的小说作者大都初露头角。继去年１１期发表查建英的中篇《丛林下的冰河》后，这一期又推出了她的短篇《献给罗莎和乔的安魂曲》，杨剑敏的《诱惑》，则是江西省２０岁小伙子的处女作。另有，西北作者雷建政的《西北黑人》，东北作者李蔚的《临界》。
    倘按题材手法分类，这一期专号的小说不妨分别冠以诸如现实、现代、志怪、武侠、历史、言情等等名目，煞是好看。为与创作配合，专号开设了“文学圆桌”、“对话和潜对话”等四个理论批评专栏，围绕小说展开探讨。唐弢关于艺术形式的论述，深中肯綮；“小说家言”特请当期作家各抒己见，更添读兴。
