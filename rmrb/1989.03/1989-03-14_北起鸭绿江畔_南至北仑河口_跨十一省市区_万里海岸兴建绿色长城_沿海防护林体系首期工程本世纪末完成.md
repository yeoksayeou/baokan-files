A senior official from the Ministry of Forestry revealed to the capital's news organizations today that following the world-renowned "Three-North" Shelterbelt Project, another large-scale ecological greening project approved by the state— the first phase of the national coastal protection forest system—will commence shortly before and after the Tree Planting Festival this year.

The coastal protection forest stretches from the Yalu River in Liaoning Province to the Beilun River in Guangxi, covering a total of 1.8 million kilometers of mainland coastline. It includes 195 coastal counties (cities, districts) in 11 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, with a total area of 25.1 million hectares. Among these, 12 are island counties with an area of 360,000 hectares.

The coastal regions play a crucial strategic role in the national economic development. Due to their location in the transition zone between land and sea, where the climate is prone to sudden changes, these areas are highly susceptible to natural disasters such as typhoons, heavy rain, floods, and sandstorms. Statistics show that the average annual economic loss caused by these disasters amounts to 2.9 billion yuan, seriously endangering people's lives and property.

The construction of coastal protection forests began in the early 1950s. In 1952, some provinces and cities established specialized institutions to manage the construction and management of coastal protection forests. In 1955, 346,000 hectares of coastal windbreak and sand-fixing forests were planted. Unfortunately, this beneficial project has long been in a state of no planning, no investment, and no systematic planning, resulting in slow progress. Especially, some of the coastal forest belts that were well-constructed in the 1950s and 1960s were severely damaged during the decade of turmoil and the subsequent years of indiscriminate logging, leading to the recurrence of natural disasters such as wind and sand. To improve the ecological environment of the coastal regions, the Ministry of Forestry, based on the Seventh Five-Year Plan for national economic and social development, has listed the construction of the coastal protection forest system as a key national protection forest project.

The total construction volume of this protection forest system is set at 3.55 million hectares. The first phase of the project, from 1989 to 2000, will cover 2.49 million hectares, increasing the forest coverage rate in the entire region from the current 24.9% to 34.8%. The second phase, scheduled from 2001 to 2010, plans to afforest an additional 1.07 million hectares.

　　北起鸭绿江畔　南至北仑河口　跨十一省市区
    万里海岸兴建绿色长城
    沿海防护林体系首期工程本世纪末完成
    本报北京３月１３日讯  记者谢联辉报道：林业部负责人今天向首都新闻单位透露，继世界闻名的“三北”防护林工程之后，国家批准的我国又一大规模的生态绿化工程——全国沿海防护林体系第一期工程，在今年植树节前后陆续展开。
    沿海防护林，北起辽宁的鸭绿江口，南至广西的北仑河口，大陆海岸线长１．８万余公里，包括沿海１１个省市自治区的１９５个海岸线县（市、区），总面积为２５１０万公顷，其中岛屿县１２个，面积为３６万公顷。
    沿海地区在全国经济发展中具有重要战略地位。因该地区处于海陆交替、气候突变地带，极易遭受台风、暴雨、洪涝、风沙等自然灾害危害。据统计，平均每年因此造成的经济损失达２９亿元之巨，严重危害人们的生命财产。
    沿海防护林建设起于５０年代初期。在１９５２年，一些省市就建立了专门负责建设管理海岸防护林的机构，１９５５年营造海岸防风固沙林３４．６万公顷。可惜，这项利国利民的工程由于长期处于无计划、无投资、无体系“规划”状态，进展缓慢，特别是一些５０年代和６０年代建设较好的林带，遭到十年动乱时期和前些年的乱砍滥伐，已经治理的风沙等自然灾害又重新开始危害。为改善沿海地区生态环境，林业部根据国家国民经济和社会发展第七个五年计划，把沿海防护林体系建设列为全国重点防护林工程项目。
    这个防护林体系建设总工程量确定为３５５万公顷。１９８９年至２０００年为第一期工程，工程量为２４９万公顷，完成之后全区森林覆盖率由现在的２４．９％增加到３４．８％；第二期工程，时间安排在２００１年至２０１０年，规划造林面积为１０７万公顷。
