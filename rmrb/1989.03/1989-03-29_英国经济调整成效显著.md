The British economy has shown significant adjustment results under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher over nearly a decade. The series of major adjustments she has implemented have yielded notable effects.

Since the late 1970s, Britain has been carrying out large-scale economic adjustments. By the early 1980s, the economy began to gradually shake off its "ailing" state and showed signs of improvement. Today, the results are even more evident. Between 1982 and 1987, Britain's annual average GDP growth rate was 3.1%, significantly higher than in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1988, Britain's economic growth rate was 4.7%, higher than all Western developed countries except Japan.

Of course, due to the prolonged "British disease," the gap between Britain and other developed countries is still large, and Britain has not yet shaken off its relatively backward position. At the end of the 1960s, Britain was second among the five major Western countries in per capita GDP, but by the end of the 1980s, it had fallen to the last place. Therefore, it will take some time for Britain to catch up again.

In recent years, Britain's economic growth has benefited from a significant increase in labor productivity. In terms of total factor (labor, capital) productivity growth, Britain has outperformed other countries. Taking the steel industry as an example, a few years ago, Britain's labor productivity was the lowest among the five major Western countries, with per capita steel production 40% lower than West Germany. Now, it has become the most efficient. In 1980, producing one ton of steel required 14.5 man-hours, but now it only requires 6 man-hours. The number of employees in the steel industry has decreased by two-thirds compared to 1980, but production has significantly increased.

During the adjustment process, the Thatcher government, on the one hand, reduced subsidies for some traditional industries and, through privatization or other means, reduced the production of traditional industries in decline. On the other hand, it vigorously promoted the development of new technologies. Technological progress and increased labor productivity have enhanced the competitiveness of British manufacturing. Between 1960 and 1980, Britain's share in the world's manufactured goods exports declined from 12% to 7%. But since the early 1980s, this downward trend has been reversed, and the competitiveness of British industrial products in the international market has been improving.

From a macroeconomic perspective, after Thatcher took office, she implemented a monetary tightening policy, gradually changing the "stagflation" situation, and achieving relatively rapid economic growth under low inflation. In 1980, Britain's annual consumer price increase rate was 20%, which dropped to 4.1% in 1987 and only slightly increased in 1988. The significant drop in the consumer price index is related to the drop in energy prices and the development of the North Sea oil fields, but the most important factor is the control of money supply and relatively rapid production growth. In 1980, Britain's money supply (M3) annual growth rate was as high as 18.5%, which dropped to about 8% in 1988. Generally, it achieved a proper match between money supply growth and production growth.

It is worth noting that during the adjustment period, British workers' real wages have significantly increased. Between 1982 and 1988, the national workers' real wage growth rate was 20%. British workers' real wage growth was achieved under the condition of improved product competitiveness, which is a stark contrast to the situation in the 1960s.

It should be noted that although the British economy faced unfavorable internal and external environments at the start of the adjustment, it later shook off stagnation and transitioned from low-speed to recovery. Meanwhile, domestically, the development of North Sea oil was also an important favorable factor for the British economy. The development of the North Sea oil fields turned Britain from an oil-importing country into an oil-exporting country. In 1985, oil production reached its peak, with daily production of 2.5 million barrels. That year, oil production value accounted for 6% of GDP, and oil exports accounted for 21% of total export income. Currently, these two aspects still account for 3% and 11%, respectively. Oil exports allowed the government to increase fiscal revenue while implementing tax cuts. Without this favorable factor, it would have been difficult to implement large-scale adjustment policies.

Of course, adjustments inevitably come at a cost. One of the costs is increased unemployment over a period.

Of course, there are still many problems in the British economy, such as the per capita output value of the manufacturing industry being lower than that of most developed countries, 30% lower than Japan, 40% lower than the United States, and nearly 50% lower than West Germany. If the growth rate since the 1980s continues, it will take Britain more than 40 years to catch up with the United States' level in the manufacturing industry. However, economic development has its own internal laws. For example, rapid economic growth is a good thing, but if it overheats, it will increase demand, accelerate credit expansion, lead to price increases and market instability, and cause economic imbalances. After experiencing the relatively high economic growth in 1988, the Thatcher government is now considering cooling down the economy.

### 英国经济调整成效显著

　　英国经济调整成效显著
    撒切尔夫人执政近１０年来，对英国经济进行了一系列重大调整，成效颇为显著。
    ７０年代末英国经济就开始实行大规模调整，到８０年代初逐步摆脱“病魔缠身”的局面，出现好转，至今，成效更加明显。１９８２—１９８７年间，英国的国内生产总值年平均增长率为３．１％，大大高于６０年代和７０年代。１９８８年英国经济年增长率为４．７％，高于除日本以外的所有西方发达国家。
    当然，由于“英国病”拖得太长，与其他发达国家拉开的距离太大，英国还没有从相对落后的地位中摆脱出来。６０年代末，英国在西方５大国中按人均国内生产总值居第２位，到８０年代末则处于末位。因此，英国要重新赶到前头尚需时日。
    近年来，英国经济的增长得益于劳动生产率的显著提高。在劳动生产率的增长中，总要素（劳动、资本）生产率的增长好于其他国家。以钢铁部门为例，前些年，英国的劳动生产率曾是西方５大国中最低的，人均钢产量低于联邦德国４０％，而目前已成为最有效率的了。１９８０年生产１吨钢需１４．５个人小时，而如今只需要６个人小时，钢铁部门雇佣人数较之１９８０年减少了２／３，但产量却明显增长。
    在调整过程中，玛·撒切尔政府一方面削减对一些传统工业的补贴，并通过私有化或其他方式减少处于衰落状态的传统工业生产，另一方面则大力推动新技术的发展。技术进步和劳动生产率的提高使英国制造业增强了竞争力。１９６０—１９８０年间，英国的制成品出口在世界制成品出口中的地位呈下降趋势，由占１２％降到７％。但自８０年代初以来下降趋势开始扭转，英国工业品在国际市场上的竞争力在提高。
    从宏观经济角度看，撒切尔夫人执政后实行通货紧缩政策，逐步改变了“滞胀”的局面，实现了低通货膨胀下的经济较快增长。１９８０年英国的消费物价年上涨率为２０％，１９８７年降到４．１％，１９８８年只略有上升。消费物价指数大幅度下跌虽然与能源价格下跌、开发北海油田有关，但最主要的是控制货币发行和生产较快增长。１９８０年英国的货币供应量（Ｍ３）年增长率高达１８．５％，１９８８年降到约８％。大体上实现了货币供给增长与生产增长之间适度配合。
    值得注意的是，在调整期间，英国职工实际工资大大增长。１９８２—１９８８年间，全国职工实际工资增长幅度为２０％，英国职工实际工资的增长是在产品竞争力提高的条件下实现的，这与６０年代的情况形成鲜明的对照。
    应该看到，英国经济的调整虽然起步时内外环境都不利，但后来经济摆脱停滞，并由低速转入复苏，与此同时，在国内，北海石油的开发也是促进英国经济的一个重要有利因素。北海油田的开发使英国由石油进口国变为出口国。１９８５年石油产量达到高峰，日产达２５０万桶，是年，石油产值占国内生产总值的６％，石油出口占全部出口收入的２１％，目前这两个方面的比例仍分别为３％和１１％。石油出口使政府能够在推行减税的同时增加财政收入。如果没有这个有利因素，大规模调整的政策是难以施行的。
    当然，调整不可能不付出一定代价。其代价之一就是在一个时期内失业增加。
    当然，英国经济中存在的问题仍不少，如制造业的人均产值仍比大多数发达国家为低，比日本低３０％，比美国低４０％，比联邦德国低近５０％。如果按８０年代以来的增长速度，那么，英国制造业的人均产值要赶上美国的水平还要４０多年的时间。不过，经济发展有自己内在的规律，例如，经济增长快是件好事，但过热了会增大需求，加速信贷膨胀，导致物价上升和市场不稳，使经济失衡。在经历了１９８８年的较高经济增长之后，玛·撒切尔政府现在考虑降温了。
