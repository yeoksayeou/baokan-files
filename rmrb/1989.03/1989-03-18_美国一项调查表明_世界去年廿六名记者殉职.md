Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 16th.

A survey by the U.S. Committee to Protect Journalists shows that at least 26 journalists died on duty worldwide in 1988. The survey covered 85 countries and regions and identified the Philippines and Afghanistan as the most dangerous places for journalists. In the Philippines, five journalists were killed while on assignment, and in Afghanistan, four journalists lost their lives.

The report condemns the Israeli authorities for preventing Palestinian journalists from reporting in the occupied territories. It states that at least 44 Palestinian journalists were detained last year.

The report was released on the fourth anniversary of the abduction of American journalist Terry Anderson in Beirut. Today, friends, colleagues, and some politicians gathered on Capitol Hill in Washington to commemorate the occasion.
