Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 9th.

Spring plowing is underway in both southern and northern Jiangnan, and many farmers are worried about the shortage of chemical fertilizers. Professor Shi Yuanchun, the president of Beijing Agricultural University, has a message for everyone: formula fertilization can reduce fertilizer usage by 10% while increasing crop yield by 10%. This year, more than one-third of the nation's 14 billion mu of farmland will promote this technology. Don't miss this good opportunity.

Professor Shi Yuanchun showed a report from the Ministry of Agriculture to the reporter, explaining that last year, many places suffered from disasters, but the plots that used formula fertilization generally reduced the extent of yield reduction. Some even achieved a bumper harvest in a disaster year. The quality of agricultural products has also improved, and formula fertilization has played a significant role in this.

    用肥减一成　产量增一成
    配方施肥有妙用
    据新华社北京３月９日电  （记者鹿永建）江南江北已扬鞭春耕，许多农民朋友为化肥不足搓手顿足。北京农业大学校长石元春教授捎话给大家：配方施肥能把用肥量减一成，作物产量增一成，今年全国１４亿亩耕地有１／３以上要推广这项技术，请大家莫错过这好机会。
    石元春教授拿出农业部一份报告对记者讲，去年不少地方受了灾，但是凡配方施肥的地块大都降低了减产程度，有的甚至灾年夺丰收。农产品的品质也改善了：都少不了配方施肥一份功劳。
