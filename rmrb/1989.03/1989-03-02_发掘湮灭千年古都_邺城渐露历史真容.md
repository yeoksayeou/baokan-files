The ancient city of Ye, a city of great significance in the history of Chinese urban development, has gradually revealed its true form after being buried for a thousand years.

This ancient city is located in Linzheng County, Hebei Province. In the year 204 AD, Wei King Cao Cao established his capital here. Later, the Later Zhao, Ran Wei, Former Yan, Eastern Wei, and Northern Qi dynasties also made this their capital.

Ye City is divided into two parts: the Northern City and the Southern City. The Northern City was first built during the Wei Dynasty, and the Southern City was constructed during the Eastern Wei Dynasty. By the end of the 6th century, Ye City was destroyed in the turmoil of war.

Over the past five years, the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the Hebei Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics have jointly organized excavations and surveys here. Xu Guangji, who is in charge of this work, recently introduced to reporters the significance of the excavation and survey of Ye City, especially the Northern City of Ye. He said that during the period from the Han to the Tang Dynasties, the planning and layout of ancient Chinese cities underwent significant changes, and this change began with the Northern City of Ye. The most distinctive feature of the layout of Ye City is that a major east-west thoroughfare divides the city into northern and southern sections, and there is a symmetrical and evenly distributed central axis.

    发掘湮灭千年古都  邺城渐露历史真容
    据新华社北京3月1日电  （记者吴会劲、通讯员朱岩石）中国城市发展史上具有划时代意义的一座古代都城——邺城，在湮没千年之后，正逐渐显露出真相。
    这座古城位于河北省临漳县境内，公元204年魏王曹操在这里建都，之后，后赵、冉魏、前燕、东魏、北齐，也以此为都。
    邺城分北城和南城两部分，北城始建于曹魏，南城营建于东魏，6世纪末邺城毁于战乱。
    近5年来，中国社会科学院考古研究所和河北省文物研究所在这里联合组织了勘探发掘。主持这项工作的徐光冀日前向记者介绍了邺城、尤其是邺北城勘探发掘的重要意义：在汉至唐期间，中国古代都市的规划布局发生了很大变化，而这个变化就始于邺北城。邺城格局的最大特点，一是一条横贯东西的大道将城分为南北两区，二是有对称均匀的中轴线。
