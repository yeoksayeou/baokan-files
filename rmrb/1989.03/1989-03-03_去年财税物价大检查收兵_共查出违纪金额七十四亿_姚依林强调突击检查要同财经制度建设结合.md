    Last year's nationwide inspection of taxation, finance, and prices concluded before the Spring Festival. Today, the State Council held a meeting in Beijing to report on the inspection results. Vice Premier Yao Yilin, after listening to the reports, emphasized that the inspections of taxation, finance, and prices are not just year-end spot checks but should be linked with daily work and combined with the strengthening of financial and economic systems to lay a foundation for the success of the rectification and adjustment.

    According to the report from the State Council's Office for the Inspection of Taxation, Finance, and Prices, this year's inspection was more extensive, in-depth, and effective compared to previous years. By the end of January this year, 7.38 million enterprises, institutions, administrative units, and individual industrial and commercial households nationwide had conducted self-inspections, covering 91.5% of the total. Local governments and departments dispatched nearly 600,000 personnel to inspect 2.57 million enterprises and units, covering 38.6% of the total. Through self-inspections and key inspections, a total of 7.41 billion yuan in various funds that should have been turned over to the state treasury were found to have been violated, with 5.65 billion yuan already turned over, representing increases of 26.5% and 18.1% respectively compared to the previous year.

    This inspection revealed that the prominent illegal and disciplinary issues in various places are as follows:

    First, evading and underreporting industrial and commercial taxes and energy and transportation funds totaling 4.22 billion yuan, accounting for 34.3% of the total amount of violations. Nationwide, about 50% of enterprises and units have tax evasion issues, with some places reaching 70% to 80%. Individual industrial and commercial households have even more widespread tax evasion.

    Second, inflating costs, embezzling profits, falsely reporting losses, and encroaching on state revenues, totaling 3.86 billion yuan, accounting for 31.4% of the total amount of violations. Many enterprises violate the cost management regulations by arbitrarily expanding the scope of cost expenditures, encroaching on state revenues. Some enterprises appropriate revenues that should be turned over to the state as their own. Some law enforcement departments violate the law, privately appropriating and using confiscated funds, spending recklessly.

    Third, arbitrary price increases and illegal charges, encroaching on state and user interests, totaling 1.46 billion yuan, accounting for 11.9% of the total amount of violations. This problem is particularly prominent in some monopolistic industries and commercial companies.

    Fourth, excessive issuance of bonuses and gifts, entertainment, business trips at public expense, and reckless purchase of controlled commodities, wasting state funds, totaling 520 million yuan, accounting for 4.2% of the total amount of violations. Despite the State Council's issuance of a series of documents promoting clean governance, some enterprises and institutions continue to issue money and goods recklessly, expanding consumption funds, and losing control in some regions and units.

    Fifth, a number of economic crime cases involving embezzlement, theft, bribery, abuse of power for personal gain, and embezzlement by custodians, although the number of people involved is small, the harm is great.

    At the meeting, 26 personnel from the State Council's inspection teams sent to various places were commended.

    去年财税物价大检查收兵
    共查出违纪金额七十四亿
    姚依林强调突击检查要同财经制度建设结合
    本报北京3月2日讯  本报记者王锦鹄、新华社记者丁坚铭报道：1988年全国税收、财务、物价大检查工作到春节前已基本结束。今天国务院在此间召开了大检查情况汇报会。国务院副总理姚依林听取汇报后强调，税收、财务、物价大检查不仅仅是年终性的突击检查，而是要进一步同日常工作相联系，要同加强财经制度建设结合起来，为治理整顿取得成效打好基础。
    从国务院税收、财务、物价大检查办公室的汇报情况看，这次大检查的声势、规模、深度和成效都好于往年。截至今年1月底，全国有738万个企业、事业、行政单位和个体工商户进行了自查，自查面为91.5％；各地方和部门派出近60万人对257万户企业、单位进行了重点检查，检查面为38.6％。通过自查和重点检查，全国共查出各种应上交财政的违纪金额74.1亿元，已上交入库56.5亿元，分别比上年增加26.5％和18.1％。
    这次大检查发现，各地突出的违法违纪问题，一是偷漏工商税和能源交通基金共计42.2亿元，占违纪金额的34.3％。从全国情况看，存在偷漏税问题的企业和单位约占总户数的50％，有些地方达70％至80％。个体工商户偷漏税情况更为普遍。
    二是乱挤成本、截留利润，虚报亏损，侵占国家收入，共查出38.6亿元，占违纪总额的31.4％。不少企业违反成本管理条例的规定，擅自扩大成本开支范围，挤占国家收入。还有些企业把应上交国家的收入据为单位所有。有些执法部门执法犯法、私自截留、动用罚没收入，胡花乱支。
    三是乱加价，乱收费，侵占国家和用户利益。共查出14.6亿元，占违纪金额的11.9％。这一问题在一些垄断性行业和商业性公司中尤为突出。
    四是滥发奖金实物，请客送礼，公费旅游，乱购专控商品，挥霍国家资财。共查出这方面资金5.2亿元，占违纪总额的4.2％。在国务院颁发一系列为政清廉的文件之后，一些企事业单位仍无收敛，继续滥发钱物，扩大消费基金，在一些地区和单位已失去控制。
    五是贪污盗窃，行贿受贿，以权谋私，监守自盗等一批经济犯罪案件，人数虽不多，但危害极大。
    会上，有26位国务院派往各地的大检查工作组的工作人员受到了表彰。
