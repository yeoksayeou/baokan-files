Xinhua News Agency, March 8th.

Pig production and sales have once again become unstable. Commercial departments are facing a surplus of pork, while some regions are reporting difficulties in selling pigs.

According to a report by our correspondent Pan Gang, just three months ago, Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai were worried about the decline in pork reserves. Now, these three major cities are facing a surplus of pork. Relevant departments have provided information indicating that this situation is not unique to these three cities. By the end of February this year, the national commercial system had a surplus of pork, reaching an all-time high in storage quantities.

Since mid-November last year, the main pig-producing areas have seen a sharp increase in pig purchases. By the end of the year, the national state-owned commercial food departments had a pig inventory of 19.92 million heads. By the end of January this year, this number had increased to 22 million heads. Currently, the cold storage facilities in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai have exceeded their reasonable capacity by 10% to 20%. In some places, farmers are once again facing difficulties in selling their pigs.

Currently, the second quarter's pig purchasing "small peak season" is approaching. According to past trends, the next few months usually see a surplus of three to four million heads of pigs in purchases over sales. Relevant personnel are concerned that it will be difficult to clear the inventory in the producing areas, and purchasing pigs in the next few months will be a major problem.

　　生猪产销再度反复
    商业部门猪肉胀库
    部分地区农民又喊卖猪难
    本报讯  记者潘岗报道：３个月前还在为猪肉库存下降发急的北京、天津、上海３大城市，如今又为猪肉胀库发愁了。有关部提供的情况表明，这一情况不仅３大市存在，到今年２月末，全国商业系统猪肉普遍胀库，库存数量达历史最高水平。
    去年１１月中旬以来，生猪主产区生猪收购量急剧增加。到年末，全国国营商业食品部门生猪库存１９９２万头，今年１月末又增加到２２００万头。目前，北京、天津、上海３大市冷库已超过合理容量１０％—２０％。在一些地方农民卖猪难又重新抬头。
    眼下，第二季度生猪收购“小旺季”即将到来。按照往年规律，未来的几个月一般都购大于销三四百万头生猪。有关人士担心，产区难腾库，今后几个月收购生猪将成大问题。
