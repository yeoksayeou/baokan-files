A person who claimed to be the director of the tobacco bureau in Lěngshuǐtān, Hunan, traveled to Shaoyang City at the end of last December, spreading false information. He claimed that a close friend of his was a shareholder of an American bank and had established an investment insurance company in Dalian, Liaoning. The company supposedly had 700 million yuan deposited in the Dalian Industrial and Commercial Bank, and he was tasked with finding loan recipients or joint venture partners. This "director" carried with him a letter of authorization from the Dalian Investment Insurance Company, as well as loan application letters and letters of intent from various units such as the Agricultural Bank of Hengnan County and the Construction Bank of Lǔpǔ County. Many of these documents bore the seals of county-level or higher government agencies. An investigation by the Shaoyang Construction Bank revealed that the tobacco bureau in Lěngshuǐtān did not have such a "director," and the 700 million yuan was entirely fictitious.

Since last year, the Shaoyang Construction Bank has encountered numerous instances of people introducing foreign investments, some introduced by individuals, some by social organizations, and a significant portion by relevant authorities. However, none of these introductions have yielded results. Some units, including government departments, believe that writing a loan application for the relevant "intermediaries" and affixing a seal is acceptable, as long as no upfront fees are paid, even if the loan is not secured. In reality, some of these so-called "intermediaries" use the guarantees provided by banks or official documents bearing government seals to deceive and defraud, causing severe political and economic harm to the country.

Therefore, it is hoped that places and units in need of loans will be cautious and not easily believe in foreign investment introducers of unknown origin, to avoid being deceived and defrauded.

　　求贷心切者警惕        
    外资引荐人有诈
    一名自称湖南冷水滩市烟草局局长的人，去年１２月底来到邵阳市四处活动，他谎称他的一好友是美国某银行的股东，在辽宁大连市开设了一家投资保险公司，现有７亿元人民币存大连工商银行，委托他寻找贷款单位或合资伙伴。这位“局长”随身携带有大连投资保险公司的委托书，以及衡南县农业银行、溆浦县建设银行等许多单位给他的贷款申请书和意向书，许多文件盖有县级以上人民政府的大印。经邵阳市建设银行调查，冷水滩市烟草局根本没有这位“局长”，７亿元人民币当然也系子虚乌有。
    去年以来，邵阳市建设银行多次遇到过引荐外资的“好事”，有个人介绍的，有社会团体介绍的，还有相当一部分是有关主管部门介绍的，但都没有结果。有些单位甚至是政府部门认为，给有关“中介人”写一份贷款申请，盖个章，只要不先付手续费，即使贷不着款也问题不大。其实，一些所谓“中介人”利用银行提供的担保或盖有政府大印的批文到处招摇撞骗，给国家带来极坏的政治和经济影响。
    因此，希望那些需要贷款的地方和单位，切勿轻信来路不明的外资引荐者，谨防上当受骗。
