Tianjin people's nightlife is restricted. According to regulations from Tianjin municipal authorities, entertainment venues cannot operate past 10 PM. However, according to people's habits, nightlife is precisely the cultural activities that take place after 10 PM.

Tianjin people love excitement. In the early days after liberation, famous areas like Nan Market, Bird Market, Pao Yi Street, and Quanyi Market were bustling with over a hundred entertainment venues of various sizes. There were large theaters, small playhouses, story-telling teahouses, and also venues for cross-talk and drum ballads. There were also dance halls and billiard rooms. People of different social strata could choose according to their preferences. These cultural venues not only provided Tianjin people with entertainment but also nurtured a group of artists. Counting some of today's famous figures, such as the "Golden Voice King" Luo Yusheng and the humor master Ma Sanli, they all rose to fame on these cultural stages. In the 1980s, Tianjin people's interests became more diverse, especially with the emergence of modern means of expression like television, VCRs, and tape recorders, which expanded the cultural life of the masses. However, Tianjin people's nightlife is not vibrant: the time for activities is getting shorter, and the venues are getting fewer. With a population of eight million, Tianjin has only thirty-four professional cinemas, one hundred and three film theaters, seventy-eight dance halls, six music teahouses, and over three hundred VCR screening points. Even if all these venues are full, they can only accommodate five percent of Tianjin's population.

The lack of vibrancy in Tianjin people's nightlife is first related to the degree of openness in people's minds. When it comes to nightlife, some people naturally associate it with capitalists, rich young masters, and even prostitutes from before liberation, as if nightlife only belongs to these people and not to the common folk. Some leaders say, "Reading books and newspapers at night is good; wasting good time in dance halls and theaters is pointless." Or they say, "Good people don't go to such places of amusement." Or, "Who will take responsibility if something happens?" By night, most of Tianjin's common folk can only stay at home.

Next is the preservation of reputation. In recent years, Tianjin's social security situation has been good, enjoying a reputation nationwide, so they preserve it. Some people passively preserve it, not wanting to organize many activities. If a case occurs, they push it out as much as possible, fearing that the case will happen in their jurisdiction.

Generally speaking, cultural centers are connected with commercial centers. People go there not only for entertainment but also to shop and taste snacks. Currently, Tianjin does not have such a social environment and conditions: store operating hours are relatively short. Watching TV, listening to the radio, reading newspapers and books, respectively account for 94.4%, 84.5%, and 83.1% of the total population. Spontaneous cultural activities like family outings and watching films and performances are mostly enjoyed by people only on holidays.

If one says Tianjin has no nightlife, it does not reflect the reality. "Wealth brings joy" has become the trend of the times. Under the tide of reform and opening up, Tianjin people's consciousness of self-expression and self-entertainment is increasingly strong, thus emerging street culture, family culture, folk culture, tourism culture, venue culture, field culture, youth culture, campus culture, enterprise culture, and military camp culture, all of which have formed their own characteristics and styles.

Despite this, Tianjin people still feel regretful. Overall, nightlife is still dull and monotonous. They hope that relevant departments will provide enthusiastic support to make nightlife more vibrant and rich.

### 天津人的遗憾：  夜生活截至晚十点

　　天津人的遗憾：
    夜生活截至晚十点
    张淑英
    天津人的夜生活是受到限制的。据天津市有关部门规定，娱乐场所的营业时间不得超过晚上十点钟。而按照人们的习惯，夜生活恰恰是晚上十点钟以后那段时间的群众文化生活。
    天津人是很爱热闹的。解放初期，闻名全国的南市、鸟市、估衣街、劝业场等繁华地区，遍布着百余个大小不等的娱乐场所，有大剧场，小戏院子，说书茶馆，也有相声、鼓曲的曲艺厅，还有舞厅和台球厅，不同层次的人们根据自己的爱好进行选择。这些文化阵地不仅为天津人提供了娱乐场所，而且在这块沃土上造就了一批艺术家。数数当今的一些名人，如“金嗓歌王”骆玉笙，幽默大师马三立等，就是在这些文化阵地上逐渐成名的。进入八十年代，天津人的爱好更加广泛，尤其是现代的表现手段，如电视、录相、录音机等出现后，扩大了群众的文化生活领域。然而，天津人的夜生活并不活跃：活动的时间越来越短，阵地越来越少。全市八百万人口，能选择的文化阵地只有三十四个专业电影院，一百零三个影剧院，七十八家舞厅，六个音乐茶座和三百多个录相放映点，全部客满也只能容纳天津市人口的百分之五。
    天津人的夜生活不活跃，首先与观念上的开放程度有关系。一提夜生活，一些人便自然地与解放前的资本家、阔少爷、甚至妓女挂上钩，似乎夜生活只属于这些人，老百姓不需要。一些领导说：“晚上读读书，看看报多好，大好时光浪费在舞厅、戏院没出息”；或说：“好人不去那种玩闹地方”；再就是“出了问题谁负责”？到了晚上，天津绝大部分老百姓就只好猫在家里。
    其次是保荣誉。这几年天津市社会治安情况良好，在全国享有声誉，于是就保。有些人是消极的保，不愿多搞活动，如果发生了案件，尽量往外推，生怕案件发生在自己管辖的区域内。
    一般地说，文化中心都与商业中心相连接，人们到那里不仅可以娱乐，还可以逛商店、品尝小吃。目前天津还不具备这样的社会环境和条件：商店营业时间比较短。看电视、听广播、读书看报，分别约占居民总数的百分之九十四点四、百分之八十四点五和百分之八十三点一。举家游玩、观看影剧演出等即兴性的文化活动，多数人只是在节假日有此雅兴。
    如果说天津没有夜生活也不符合实际。“富而思乐”已成为当今时代的潮流。在改革开放的大潮下，天津人自我表现、自我娱乐的参与意识日趋增强，于是出现了街头文化、家庭文化、民俗文化、游览文化、阵地文化、田野文化、青年文化、校园文化、企业文化、军营文化，并都已形成了各自的特色和风格。
    尽管如此，天津人依然感到遗憾，夜生活总的说还是枯燥乏味，希望得到有关方面热情的支持，让夜生活活跃起来，丰富起来。
