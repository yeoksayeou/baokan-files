Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji recently said at a citywide meeting to clean up construction projects that any promises he had made in the past regarding some construction projects that do not align with the cleanup principles are null and void.

Zhu Rongji said that writing notes and pulling strings have been major reasons why efforts to clean up construction projects have been ineffective for many years. As a result, projects that should not have been started often "squeeze" out those that should have been, leading to low investment returns. Zhu Rongji emphasized that Shanghai must stop any projects that should be halted.

　　朱熔基谈上海压缩基建项目
    该下的一定要下  市长承诺不作数
    新华社上海３月１１日电  （通讯员沈志芳、记者季进成）上海市市长朱熔基日前在全市清理基建项目动员会上说，过去他对一些基建项目所作的允诺，凡与清理原则不符的，都不作数。
    朱熔基说，批条子、说人情是多年来清理基建项目收效甚微的重要原因。于是，一些不该上的项目往往在物资、资金、施工力量上“挤”该上的项目，投资效益不高。朱熔基表示，上海该下的项目一定要下。
