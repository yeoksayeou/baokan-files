IMSS is the abbreviation for the Mexican Social Security Institute and is an effective social insurance system in Mexico. In public buildings across Mexico, people often see the letters IMSS and a sculpture of an "eagle protecting a mother breastfeeding her child." This is the image of IMSS.

IMSS was established in 1945 and is an institution that carries out medical and health care, cultural and sports activities, and welfare work. The state stipulates that 18% of the total wages of all employees nationwide should be used as the social security fund for IMSS. In this fund, enterprises pay 70%, employees contribute 25%, and the remaining 5% is subsidized by the state from fiscal revenue. Each employee contributes approximately 4.5% of their salary, and one person's insurance covers the entire family. The state only needs to spend a limited amount of money, and employees' contributions are not much, with the bulk coming from enterprises. This solves a major social problem. Now, out of Mexico's 82 million people, IMSS covers 36 million. Starting in the late 1970s, IMSS expanded its coverage from private enterprise employees to rural areas.

Currently, IMSS has 1,260 primary hospitals, 255 general hospitals, and 10 national-level central hospitals across the country. IMSS's primary hospitals, also known as "family integrated hospitals," in addition to general outpatient services and routine examinations, are also responsible for family planning and water quality improvement and other health care work. Each doctor is responsible for several hundred households, providing preventive injections and establishing health records. Most common diseases can be treated in primary hospitals. General hospitals are well-equipped and have specialized departments; they usually have dozens to a few hundred beds. For serious and difficult cases, they are treated in central hospitals. The construction and equipment of IMSS central hospitals are also funded by the social security fund. They possess Mexico's most advanced medical equipment and top medical experts. IMSS also cooperates with the Ministry of Health to implement health and epidemic prevention plans through the medical network. Nationwide, 8,189 health committees have been established, with 49,633 volunteers; each person is responsible for 25 households.

IMSS has also established kindergartens and cultural, sports, and other social welfare facilities across the country. Its theaters, cultural centers, and sports facilities are generally open to the public for free. IMSS also operates vacation villages with relatively low fees. On weekends, people flock out of the noisy and polluted cities to vacation villages by the mountains and rivers, where they can hike, swim, have picnics, and breathe the fresh air of nature. IMSS also provides retirement benefits to retired employees, and this year, more than a million people have received their retirement benefits.

Mexico is a developing country with limited financial resources and cannot yet meet all social needs. However, through the joint efforts of the state, enterprises, and employees, IMSS actively carries out social security activities for workers. Mexican public opinion believes that its significance lies in the state protecting workers' rights, enterprises recognizing workers' rights, and workers having their own rights.

　　伊姆斯人人喜        
    ——墨西哥社会保险制度一瞥
    本报记者  郭伟成
    伊姆斯（ＩＭＳＳ）是墨西哥社会保险委员会的缩写，也是墨西哥行之有效的一种社会保险制度。在墨西哥各地的公益建筑上，人们常可以看到ＩＭＳＳ的字样和一座“雄鹰展翅保护着一位给幼儿哺乳的母亲”的雕塑，这就是伊姆斯的形象。
    伊姆斯创建于１９４５年，是开展医疗保健、文化体育、优抚等社会福利活动的机构。国家规定，每年以相当于全国职工工资总额１８％的费用作为伊姆斯的社会保障基金。在基金中，企业支付７０％，职工交纳的保障金占２５％，剩余５％由国家从财政税收中给予补贴。每一职工交纳的约占其工资的４．５％，而且一人投保，全家受益。国家只需支出有限的钱，职工的支出也不很多，大头由企业出，这样就解决了一个很大的社会问题。现在，墨西哥全国８２００万人中，伊姆斯已经包下了３６００万人。７０年代末开始，伊姆斯的保障范围从私人企业职工扩大到了农村。
    目前，伊姆斯在各地拥有１２６０家初级医院，２５５家综合性医院、１０家全国性中心医院。伊姆斯的初级医院，也称“家庭一体化医院”，除了普通门诊和常规检查外，还负责计划生育、改良水质等卫生保健工作。每个医生分片联系数百户居民，进行预防注射，建立健康档案。大多数常见病都可以在初级医院解决。综合性的医院设备齐全，分科治疗；一般拥有数十张到二三百张病床。逢到重病、疑难病症，便由中心医院收治。伊姆斯中心医院的基本建设与设备也是由保障基金中支出的。它们拥有墨西哥最先进的医疗设备以及一流的医学专家。伊姆斯还与卫生部配合，通过医疗网推行卫生防疫计划。全国建立起８１８９个卫生委员会，有４９６３３个义务员；每人联系２５户居民。
    伊姆斯还在全国建立了幼儿园以及文化、体育等社会福利设施。它开办的剧院、文化中心和体育设施一般免费向公众开放。伊姆斯还开设了收费较低的度假村。逢到周末，人们纷纷走出嘈杂而又污染的都市，来到依山傍水的度假村，或登高、击水，或野炊，呼吸大自然的清新空气。伊姆斯还向退休职工发放退休金，今年已经有１００多万人领取它的退休金。
    墨西哥是一个发展中国家，财力有限，还不可能满足所有的社会需要。但是，伊姆斯通过国家、企业、职工三方集资的办法，积极开展劳动者的社会保障活动。墨西哥舆论认为，它的意义在于国家保护劳动者的权利，企业承认劳动者的权利，而劳动者拥有自己的权利。
