The article “What Does 'Kentucky Fried Chicken' Serve?” raises a question: Why does the Chinese food industry, with so many chicken dishes, not have the same appeal as a chicken from across the Atlantic? Indeed, I do not believe that American fried chicken is more to the taste of Chinese people than Chinese roasted chicken, nor do I believe it is more economical. Yet, "Kentucky Fried Chicken" has made a splash in Beijing. The reporter's analysis is that people go to "Kentucky Fried Chicken" not just to eat chicken, or to eat quickly, or to eat a snack, or to eat a famous brand. Deeper down, it seems they are eating American culture. Perhaps this hits the nail on the head. Economics is intertwined with culture.

On this topic, it is interesting to note that not far from "Kentucky Fried Chicken" is a newly opened Lao She Tea House. Besides attracting a large number of Chinese tea drinkers, it also attracts many foreign tea drinkers who want to experience China's "national essence." A British man, after visiting, said, "I have been in China for 7 years, and today I am experiencing Chinese culture for the first time." Foreigners visiting the Lao She Tea House are greeted by young men in brown robes and young women in red cheongsam; the experience of drinking green tea and eating chestnut steamed buns is probably similar to that of Chinese people visiting "Kentucky Fried Chicken," being greeted by well-dressed men and women, and eating fried chicken and drinking cola. If "Kentucky Fried Chicken" as a symbol of American culture embodies efficiency, quality, equality, and credibility, then the Lao She Tea House as a window to showcase Chinese culture seems to embody leisure, elegance, dignity, and antiquity. As for whether the Lao She Tea House, if opened in the United States, would be successful, it is hard to say, but its appeal is certainly not just in the tea, but in the culture, which is certain.

Recognizing that "economics is intertwined with culture" is indeed important. In business, whether in food or clothing, one must consider how to meet people's needs for clothing and food, and naturally, how to make money. However, if one stops there, without recognizing the cultural aspects, without recognizing that it can reflect different cultures, and without recognizing that people have an increasing cultural demand in these consumptions, then it is likely to be a low-level, inferior business. Therefore, those engaged in economics must study people's consumption psychology and also study people's cultural psychology, and strive to inject new cultural concepts into business operations to adapt to and guide consumers. Only then can it be considered a sophisticated business.

"Kentucky Fried Chicken" recognized this point and achieved success. Some of our enterprises have begun to understand this point and have tasted the sweetness. However, there are still quite a few business operators who are slow or even numb to this. They either stick to old ways without injecting new cultural elements, or blindly imitate without innovation, or are dazzled by the impact of foreign goods. Considering that our country's economy has just solved the problem of basic subsistence and is just beginning to move towards a moderately prosperous society, this may be understandable, but we cannot stay at this step. Business operations that do not reflect modernization cannot be called modern business operations.

　　经济里面有文化
    李德民
    《“肯德基”吃什么》提出了一个问题：为什么具有这么多“鸡”的中国食品业，却不如一个来自大西洋彼岸的“鸡”有魅力？的确，我就不相信美国的炸鸡比中国的烧鸡更对中国人的口味，也不相信它比中国烧鸡更实惠，可是，“肯德基”确实在北京打响了。记者分析，人们到“肯德基”，除了吃鸡，吃“快”，吃“派”，吃“名”，深一层看，恐怕还是吃了美国文化，也许，这话说到了要害处。经济里面有文化。
    提起这个话题，说来也巧，离“肯德基”不远有个新开张的老舍茶馆，除了吸引大量中国茶客，还吸引不少外国茶客，他们要看看中国的“国粹”。一位英国人光顾之后说：“我在中国呆了７年，今天第一次得到中国文化享受”。外国人到老舍茶馆受到穿棕色长褂小伙和穿红缎子旗袍姑娘的接待；喝清茶吃栗子面窝窝头的感受，大概跟中国人到“肯德基”受到西装革履的先生和小姐的接待，吃炸鸡喝可乐的感受差不多。如果说，“肯德基”作为美国文化的一种形象，体现了效率、质量、平等、信誉等特点，那么，老舍茶馆作为展示中国文化的一个窗口，似乎也体现了悠闲、雅致、体面、古朴的特点。至于老舍茶馆如果在美国开设了分馆能不能打响，还难以肯定，但它的吸引力也绝不只在于茶，而在于文化，这点是可以肯定的。
    认识到“经济里面有文化”，此点确乎重要。搞经营，比如说搞食品、搞服装，自然要考虑到怎么满足人们的衣、食要求，自然也要考虑到赚钱。但是仅此而已，不认识到这里面有文化，不认识到它可以体现不同文化，不认识到人们在这些消费中有日益增高的文化需求，那很可能是一种低级的、蹩脚的经营。因此，搞经济的，一定要研究人们的消费心理，也一定要研究人们的文化心理，并努力把新的文化观念注入经营之中，去适应和引导消费者，那才可能是高明的经营。
    “肯德基”认识到了这一点，它取得了成功。我国有些企业开始懂得这一点，也尝到了甜头。但是，还有相当多的经营者，对此感觉迟钝甚至麻木。他们或者墨守旧的一套而不思注入新的文化因素，或者盲目模仿而无所创造，或者在洋货冲击面前眼花缭乱。考虑到我国经济刚刚解决温饱，才开始迈向小康的大背景，这也许是可以理解的，但我们总不能停留在这一步。不体现现代化的经营，很难称为现代化的经营。
