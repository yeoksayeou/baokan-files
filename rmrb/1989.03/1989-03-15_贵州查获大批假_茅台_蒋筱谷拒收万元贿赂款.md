On January 7th, the market inspection team of the Guizhou Province, Guiyang City, Commerce Bureau seized 150 boxes (1,800 bottles) of fake Maotai alcohol, 1,900 sets of fake Maotai alcohol labels, four large jars of loose white alcohol, and 1,925 empty bottles of fake Maotai alcohol from the office of Chen Qinliang, the former director of the Guiyang Command of the Second Railway Bureau.

According to relevant personnel, Chen Qinliang had convened the Command Service Department Manager Sun Huiliang and others to plan and sell fake Maotai alcohol. Chen's office had become an underground workshop for mixing and manufacturing fake alcohol.

The next day after the case was exposed, Zhang Jishi, the director of the Guiyang City Alcohol Monopoly Bureau, and others rushed to the home of the market inspection team leader, Jiang Xiaogu, to plead for leniency. Soon after, Zhang Jishi brought Sun Huiliang, the manager of the Second Railway Bureau Command Service Department, to Jiang Xiaogu's home again, repeatedly requesting "more understanding." When the two left, they casually placed a package wrapped in paper. Jiang was unable to stop them, and upon returning to the room and opening it, found one hundred thousand yuan in cash. The next morning, Jiang Xiaogu reported the matter to the secretary of the municipal disciplinary committee and handed the cash over to the leadership of the municipal commerce bureau.

　　贵州查获大批假“茅台”
    蒋筱谷拒收万元贿赂款
    本报讯  记者江宝章报道：今年１月７日，贵州省贵阳市工商局市场检查大队在铁二局贵阳指挥部原指挥长陈钦良办公室查获假茅台酒１５０箱（１８００瓶）、假茅台酒商标１９００套、散装白酒四大坛，还查获假茅台酒空瓶１９２５个。
    据有关人员交代，陈钦良曾召集指挥部服务部经理孙惠良等人，策划、制售假茅台酒。陈的办公室成了勾兑制造假酒的地下作坊。
    案发的第二天，贵阳市酒类专卖局科长张继诗等人窜到市场检查大队长蒋筱谷家说情。不久，张继诗又带铁二局指挥部服务部经理孙惠良再次来到蒋筱谷家，再三要求“多多包涵”。两人走时随手放下一包用纸包的东西。蒋追之不及，回房打开一看，是一万元现金。第二天上午，蒋筱谷向市纪委书记报告了此事，并把现金交市工商局领导。
