The contract for the Sino-Soviet cooperation project to upgrade the Jiamusi Paper Mill was signed in Beijing on February 3.

The Jiamusi Paper Mill, built with Soviet aid in the 1950s, is currently the largest paper-making enterprise in China, with an annual production capacity of 170,000 tons of paper.

The contract states that the Soviet side will invest 1.34 billion Swiss francs, providing design, equipment, and technology to build a production line for 85,000 tons of corrugated paper annually. The necessary raw materials, mainly coniferous wood, will also be primarily supplied by the Soviet side. The Jiamusi Paper Mill will repay the investment with its products. The project is expected to take five years to complete and four years to recover the full investment. Construction is planned to begin next year.

    合同书说，苏方投资一点三四亿瑞士法郎，提供设计、设备及技术，在造纸厂建设年产八点五万吨牛皮箱板纸。生产所需的针叶木材原料也主要由苏方负责。佳木斯造纸厂以产品偿还。此项目预计工程五年，投产四年可收回全部投资。计划明年动工。
