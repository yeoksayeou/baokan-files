Recently, I came across the book "Dynamic Analysis and Policy Research on China's Economy" edited by Wú Jìnglián and Hú Jì, published by Renmin University of China Press. This book has piqued my interest. The book compiles over a dozen research reports written by the authors since 1984 based on the development of China's economy, and can be considered another representative work from the influential "comprehensive reform theory" school of thought in China's reform forum. In the academic circles of China, among the theoretical works on macroeconomic management, it is rare to find a book that conducts extensive surveys and uses empirical methods to analyze the economic dynamics of each period and propose specific policies. It is precisely because of these features that we can use today's facts to look back and verify: were the authors' past analyses and suggestions correct? Were the predictions about development verified? This is a practical way to summarize experiences and verify the theories on which these research reports are based, and deepen the empirical research on reform theories.

Analyzing economic dynamics is a very complex issue. The authors of this book do not stop at the speed of output value and temporary surface phenomena but focus on the core issues of macroeconomic management—whether the total demand and supply of society are generally balanced in terms of quantity and structure, whether resource allocation is optimized, and whether overall efficiency (including conventional efficiency and total factor productivity) is gradually improving. These are fundamental issues that relate to the sustainable, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy and create a favorable environment for reform. Based on a large amount of facts and data, the authors strive to make correct analyses. For example, after China's national economy experienced relatively stable development from 1981 to 1983, the issuance of currency surged in the second half of 1984, with the annual issuance increasing by 49.5% compared to the previous year. How should this phenomenon be viewed? Some comrades believe that this is a normal phenomenon under the conditions of reform and opening up. The authors of this book pointed out at that time that in addition to normal factors, there were a large number of abnormal factors, which were the result of excessive wage growth, lax control of administrative expenses, and overly large construction scale. They also predicted that if monetary tightening was not appropriately implemented and the speed of industrial development was not slowed down, it could lead to inflation and affect the progress of reform. Again, when the industrial growth rate reached 23% in the first quarter of 1985 on the basis of a 17.3% increase in the fourth quarter of the previous year, some people believed that this was a sign of China's economy "taking off." The authors of this book, on the one hand, affirmed the achievements, and on the other hand, emphasized that this high speed was achieved through investment and consumption stimulation, as well as excessive credit and foreign exchange support. They again proposed that such super-high-speed growth not only hindered the progress of reform and the development of a planned commodity economy but also exacerbated economic structural imbalances and fostered unhealthy practices. Furthermore, due to the implementation of several adjustment measures by the central government, the industrial growth rate in the first quarter of 1986 dropped to 4.4%, and some products began to accumulate. Some people believed that this was due to tight monetary policy and insufficient demand, leading to production shrinkage, and advocated for relaxing monetary management and increasing social demand. The authors of this book pointed out that this was the result of conscious braking after the super-high-speed growth in the fourth quarter of 1985, and the situation was basically normal. At the same time, they pointed out that the accumulation of some products was the result of the previous period's long-term overcapacity and the disappearance of false purchasing power, and that the constraint on economic development was the shortage of resources (energy, raw materials, etc.) rather than insufficient demand. They emphasized the need to further adjust the industrial structure on the premise of maintaining total control. For example, at the end of 1987, the implementation of the economic stabilization policy achieved some results, and the inflation of social total demand was relatively reduced, while total supply increased significantly. At this time, some people believed that the national economy had stabilized and improved, and in order to achieve high-speed development, it was necessary to consciously use inflation and fiscal deficits to accumulate construction funds. The authors of this book believed that the problems existing in the national economy, especially the imbalance of industrial structure, the destruction of the agricultural foundation, and the overly large scale of construction investment, had not been fundamentally eliminated. They advocated for continuing to implement the "dual-tight" policy of finance and currency (while preventing "one-size-fits-all" measures) and predicted that due to the accumulation of demand inflation in recent years, a more severe inflation might occur. The authors emphasized that the opportunity of tightening should be used to create conditions for long-term stable development, deepen reform, and create a relatively relaxed environment for the implementation of more significant coordinated reforms. I believe that all these analyses, in general, have scientific foresight and have withstood the test of practice.

Correct analysis of the situation is the basis for proposing correct policies, but it is not easy to truly propose complete and feasible policies. The authors of this book have always believed that in the process of reform, it is not advisable to adopt a single-item breakthrough approach without overall planning and rely on "impact reflection" and "feeling the way across the river." They consistently advocate for the "comprehensive reform theory," that is, advocating for coordinated reforms in macro-control, market, and enterprises, and on this basis, implementing various measures in a coordinated and "interactive" manner. Based on this idea, the authors, in response to the specific situation and prominent problems of each period, strive to propose practical and feasible suggestions. The authors believe that enterprise system reform is very important (the "price-tax-finance-linkage plan" proposed in 1986 was relatively weak in this aspect, which was quickly strengthened later), but it is not advisable to bypass price system reform and market competition mechanism formation and adopt a single-item breakthrough approach. The authors believe that in a certain sense, price system reform is the key to the success or failure of the entire economic system reform, but this reform must be carried out under the condition of a generally balanced supply and demand. In an environment where inflation has already occurred, price system reform not only cannot achieve the expected effects but will also lead to a cycle of price increases and "double distortions." Therefore, the environment must be treated first. In January 1987, the authors proposed to vigorously promote the "three guarantees and three controls" to create a relaxed economic environment within one or two years, followed by the implementation of preliminary coordinated reforms. I believe that the time required for environmental treatment is too short, the risk is great, and it is difficult to achieve. Later, the authors proposed two alternative plans in September 1987: "thoroughly treating the environment and implementing large-scale coordinated reforms" and "moderately treating the environment and implementing medium-scale coordinated reforms." I believe these are more realistic. The contents of these two plans are not fundamentally different, except that the latter plan takes a longer time. Regardless of which plan, it is necessary to first tighten up and then establish a new mechanism, gradually removing some temporary administrative measures implemented during the environmental treatment stage. The basic ideas of these policies are consistent with the spirit of the resolution of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party held in September 1988.

Now, the significant achievements and serious problems of the decade of reform and development are clearly presented. The current problem is the result of the development of past contradictions. When readers study the experience of China's decade of economic system reform, they might as well take a look at this book, make their own judgments on its correctness and shortcomings, and draw what they consider beneficial. I sincerely hope that economists from various schools of thought in China can also compile and publish their articles and research reports written over the past decade. By adhering to the principle that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth, we can jointly summarize experiences, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths, seek truth, and this will definitely be beneficial to the advancement of the great and arduous cause of socialist construction.

　　一本反映“整体改革论”学派观点的代表作
    《中国经济的动态分析和对策研究》
    李成瑞
    最近看到吴敬琏、胡季同志主编的《中国经济的动态分析和对策研究》（中国人民大学出版社出版），使我发生了浓厚的兴趣。这本书汇集了作者１９８４年以来根据我国经济发展的形势撰写的十几篇研究报告，可说是我国改革论坛上有影响的“整体改革论”学派推出的又一本代表作。在我国学术界，关于宏观经济管理的理论著作中，像这样通过大量调查研究，用实证方法对每段时间经济动态进行分析，提出具体的对策，据我所知还是不多见的。正因为这本书具有上述特色，我们可以用今天的事实回头来检验一下：作者过去的分析和建议是否正确？对发展的预测是否得到了验证？这是总结经验的一个实证性的好办法，也是检验这些研究报告所依据的理论，从而加深改革理论研究的一个实证性的好办法。
    经济动态的分析是一个十分复杂的问题。本书作者不是停留在产值速度和一时表面现象上，而是紧紧抓住宏观经济管理的核心问题——社会总需求与总供给在总量与结构上是否大体平衡，资源配置是否向优化发展，整体效益（包括常规效益与全要素生产率）是否逐步提高这样一些关系到国民经济持续稳定协调发展并为改革创造有利环境的根本问题，根据大量的事实与数据，力求作出正确的分析。比如，我国国民经济在经过１９８１—１９８３年比较稳定的发展之后，１９８４年下半年货币发行猛增，全年货币发行比上年增长４９．５％。对这一现象应当如何看待？有的同志认为这是改革、开放下的正常现象，本书作者当时就指出其中除了正常因素之外，含有大量的不正常因素，它是工资增长过快、行政经费控制不严、基建规模过大的结果，并且预言，如不适当地紧缩货币，放慢工业发展速度，可能造成通货膨胀，影响改革的进行。又如，当１９８５年一季度工业速度在上年四季度增长１７．３％的基础上进一步达到２３％的时候，有人认为这是我国经济“起飞”的表现，本书作者一方面肯定了成绩的一面，一方面着重分析了这种高速度是靠投资和消费膨胀的刺激，以及信贷、外汇过量支持的结果，并再次提出：这种超高速增长不仅妨碍改革的推进和有计划商品经济的发展，而且加重了经济结构的不协调，助长了不正之风。再如，由于中央采取了若干调整措施，使１９８６年第一季度工业速度下降到４．４％，部分产品出现了积压，有人认为这是银根过紧、需求不足造成了生产萎缩，主张放松货币管理，增加社会需求。本书作者指出，这正是１９８５年四季度超高速后自觉刹车的结果，情况基本正常；同时指出部分产品的积压是前一时期长线过长和虚假购买力由膨胀到消失的结果，制约经济发展的是资源短线（能源、原材料等）而不是需求不足；着重阐述了根本出路是在保持总量控制的前提下，进一步调整产业结构的意见。再比如，在１９８７年底，实行稳定经济政策取得了一定的效果，社会总需求的膨胀相对减缓，总供给有较多的增加。这时，有人认为国民经济已经稳定好转，为了取得高速度的发展，需要有意识地利用通货膨胀和财政赤字来积累建设资金。本书作者则认为，国民经济中存在的问题，特别是产业结构失衡、农业基础遭受破坏、基建投资规模过大等不稳定因素并未根本消除，应当继续执行财政金融“双紧”政策（同时防止“一刀切”），并预言，由于近几年来需求膨胀的积累，可能酿成比较剧烈的通货膨胀。作者强调应当把紧缩当作一次机会，为长期稳定发展、深化改革创造条件，为推出较大的配套改革造成相对宽松的环境。我认为，所有这些分析，今天看来总的说是具有科学的预见性的，是经受住了实践的检验的。
    正确的形势分析是提出正确对策的基础，但要真正提出完整可行的对策决非易事。本书作者一向认为在改革中不宜采取单项突进、不作通盘规划而凭“撞击反射”、“摸着石头过河”的做法；一贯坚持“整体改革论”，也就是主张宏观调控、市场、企业三方面配套改革，并在这一前提下实行各项措施的配套和“联动”。作者根据这一思想，针对每一时期的具体情况和突出的问题，力求提出切实可行的建议。作者认为，企业制度的改革是十分重要的（１９８６年提出的“价税财金联动方案”中这方面比较薄弱，后来很快予以加强），但决不能绕开价格体系改革和市场竞争机制的形成而单项突进。作者认为在一定意义上讲价格体系改革是整个经济体制改革成败的关键，但这一改革必须在供求大体平衡的条件下进行。在已经出现通货膨胀的环境中，价格体系的改革不但不能达到预期的效果，反而会产生价格的轮番上涨和“双重扭曲”，因此，必须首先治理环境。１９８７年１月，作者曾提出大力推行“三保三压”，用一二年的时间造成宽松的经济环境，随后推出初步配套改革的意见。我认为，这里对治理环境所需的时间设想得太短，风险很大，难以实现。后来，作者于１９８７年９月提出“充分治理环境，大步配套改革”和“中度治理环境，中步配套改革”两个可供选择的方案，我认为是比较现实的。这两个方案的内容没有本质的不同，只是后一种方案时间要长一些。不论哪种方案，都需要先行紧缩，然后建立新机制，逐步解除治理环境阶段所实行的一些临时性行政措施。这些对策的基本思路，是与１９８８年９月举行的党的十三届三中全会决议的精神相吻合的。
    现在，十年改革和发展的重大成绩和严重问题都鲜明地呈现在面前。目前的问题是过去矛盾发展的结果。读者在研究我国十年经济体制改革中的经验时，不妨看看这本书，对它的正确性和不足之处作出自己的判断，并汲取自己认为有益的东西。我热切地希望我国各个学派的经济学家也能把过去十年撰写的论文研究报告汇编出版。坚持以实践为检验真理的唯一标准，共同总结经验，互相切磋，取长补短，探求真理，这对推进伟大而艰巨的社会主义建设事业，一定是有所裨益的。
