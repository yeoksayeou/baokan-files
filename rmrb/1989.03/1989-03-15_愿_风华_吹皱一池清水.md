I am not saying that miscellaneous essays are a stagnant pool, on the contrary, they are still quite lively. The problem is that they are chaotic and disorganized, all lumped together under the label of "miscellaneous essays." Many of them are "miscellaneous" but not "essays," generally presenting a scene where art and vulgarity coexist, and profundity and shallowness are side by side. Therefore, improving the quality of miscellaneous essays, especially their artistic quality, I believe is a task for the present and the long-term future. Currently, the publication of miscellaneous essay collections, selected works, and various types of essay contests, explanations, textbooks, and appreciation guides is booming. I am both pleased and worried about this. I always feel that the current situation of miscellaneous essay creation cannot withstand such a strong wave of momentum, so we should also consider whether there is an issue of "overheating," which is not good. As the saying goes, "not only is it of no benefit, but it also causes harm." There are already quite a few selections and appreciations that have been published, and there are still four or five being rushed to print. I wonder how much confidence there is in their sales?

However, this time the "Youthful Brilliance" miscellaneous essay contest by the People's Daily (August-October 1988) shows some new developments. I feel that it has made significant progress and gains in the three important aspects of miscellaneous essay topics, writing styles, and the range of authors. Moreover, it may be the most remarkable since liberation (considering all three aspects). "Youthful Brilliance" has broken out of the narrow circle of miscellaneous essay topics, looking at the vast world of Chinese reality, using facts to prove that the writing topics for miscellaneous essays are indeed boundless, truly "under heaven, all is my land," this is one. Secondly, it proves that the writing styles, methods, or formats and models of miscellaneous essays can and should be "a hundred flowers blooming." Although there has been significant progress in this regard since the new period, there are still too many authors stuck in the inertia of generalization, formulaic writing, and uniformity. This has caused considerable dissatisfaction among many readers. "Youthful Brilliance," however, has given us a good example. The form of miscellaneous essays can indeed adopt the various methods of "eight immortals crossing the sea, each showing their own skills." If "miscellaneous essays" also have eight-legged essays, is there anything worth doing in the world? "Miscellaneous essays" are born to be the enemy of eight-legged essays in both thought and form. If we change the method and tone to advocate a single tone of "miscellaneous essay eight-legged essays," wouldn't it be laughable? I hope those who enjoy this can reflect on themselves, otherwise, one day they will reveal their true selves. Thirdly, there is the expansion of the range of authors, who are no longer just a fixed list but include people from various professions, somewhat giving the feeling of "all the wise gathering, young and old together." This shows that our miscellaneous essay authors still have considerable strength and great potential. Some high-level authors are still in a state of hiding their talents. This can be said to be a powerful proof that miscellaneous essay creation still has a great future for development and improvement. This also proves that the miscellaneous essay creation represented mainly by Lu Xun cannot be criticized or ridiculed into submission. If miscellaneous essays were to collapse with just one criticism, wouldn't it mean that the cause Lu Xun pursued had no great value? I believe that editors of literary publications can also draw good lessons from this essay contest. They must not engage in cliquism and should seriously adopt good articles from various social figures.

I hope that this "Youthful Brilliance" miscellaneous essay contest can have a positive impact on miscellaneous essay authors and editors nationwide, that is: to gather talents from all sides, broaden horizons, break through frameworks, and improve quality—strive to improve quality from both thought and artistic aspects.

　　愿“风华”吹皱一池清水
    严秀
    我不是说杂文是一潭死水，相反的它还是比较活跃的。问题是杂乱纷呈，一齐都算入“杂文”笔下，很多都是“杂”而不“文”的，普遍呈现出艺术与庸俗齐飞，深刻与浅薄并列的局面。所以提高杂文质量，尤其是艺术质量，我以为是当前及今后长时期的任务。目前出版杂文集、选集以及各种类型的征文精选、讲解、讲义、鉴赏工具书等正方兴未艾，对之我是一则以喜，一则以惧的，总觉得目前的杂文创作情况是经不起这么大的势头的波澜推涌的，因此也要考虑一下是否有“过热”的问题存在，“过热”是不好的，正是所谓“非徒无益，而又害之”。属于选文加鉴赏一类的已出的不算少，现在正在赶编的还有四五种，不知销路上有几成把握？
    但这回人民日报的“风华”杂文征文（１９８８年８—１０月）却有些新气象。我觉得它在杂文的题材、笔法与作者范围这三个重要方面都得到了较大的发展与收获，而且可能是解放后最可观的一次（综合三者而言）。“风华”突破出了杂文题材不够宽广的圈子，放眼中国现实的大千世界，用事实说明了杂文的写作题材确是无比宽广的，真可谓“普天之下，莫非吾土”了，这是一。其次，它证明了杂文的笔法、方法或叫做格式与模式也是可以而且应当“百花齐放”的。新时期以来在这方面虽然大有进步，但是有太多的作者仍处于一般化、公式化与千人一面的惯性中，为此而引起了相当多的读者很大的不满。“风华”却给了我们一个较好的例子，杂文的形式是完全可以采用“八仙过海，各显神通”的多种方式的，如果“杂文”也有八股，天下事尚可为乎？“杂文”天生下来无论在思想上与形式上都是八股文的天敌，如果变个法门、变个腔调来提倡一个腔调的“杂文八股”，岂不令人发笑？希望乐此不疲者，能够自省一下，否则终有一天会原形毕露的。第三，是作者范围的扩大，作者已不老是那么一批名单，而是多种行业的人都有了，多少有点“群贤毕至，少长成集”的味道。这件事说明我们杂文作者的力量还相当雄厚，还大有潜力，有些高水平的作者还处在韬光养晦之中。这一点，可以说是杂文创作还大有发展和提高的前途的有力证明。这也证明，以鲁迅为主要代表的杂文创作事业是不可能被骂倒或被挖苦倒的。如果杂文被一骂就倒，岂不说明鲁迅所从事的事业也没有多大价值么？我以为报刊文艺编辑更可以从此次征文中得到很好的启示，千万不要搞小圈子主义，要认真采用各种社会人士的好文章。
    我希望这次“风华”杂文征文，对全国的杂文作者和编者都能引起一种积极的作用，即：广揽众才，拓宽视野，打破框框，提高质量——从思想和艺术两个方面努力去提高质量。
