	Experts Compare the Educational Situation of Chinese and American Children
	Chinese Children Value School Life, Spend More Time on Extracurricular Studies and Less on Entertainment, and Bear Great Academic Pressure from Parents

	According to a joint survey conducted by the Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and psychologists from the University of Chicago, Chinese children place more emphasis on learning compared to their American counterparts.

	The survey results indicate significant differences in the degree to which Chinese and American children enjoy school and their eagerness to receive an education. This is because Chinese children, from the moment they start school, receive "five loves" education and are more influenced by collectivist ideals. Chinese students spend a lot of time in school for learning and activities, and the school's various regulations make primary school students focus more on their studies. In contrast, while American children also receive education on loving their country, they spend less time in school, and their extracurricular activities are rich and colorful, adding knowledge that cannot be found in textbooks and enhancing certain cognitive abilities, but also diverting students' attention from classroom learning.

	The research report points out: American first-grade children spend an average of 18.4 hours per week on watching TV, exercising, and playing, while Chinese children spend only 9.2 hours; meanwhile, the time spent on reading, doing homework, or educational activities, American first-grade children spend an average of 3.5 hours per week, while Chinese children spend 7.8 hours.

	Scholars participating in this study believe that the reasons for these differences, aside from the influence of traditional education in China and the United States, are mainly due to the fact that Chinese children bear a greater academic pressure compared to their American peers. This is because they must pass unified examinations to advance to middle school, high school, and university, and the schools they can attend are directly related to their future employment. The pressure they bear is something that American children have never experienced. This pressure also affects the parents of Chinese children. American parents do not emphasize grades; they pay more attention to cultivating children's social skills and cognitive abilities.

　　专家比较中美儿童就学状况
    中国儿童看重学校生活，课外学习时间长而娱乐时间短，承受家长的学习压力大
    据新华社北京３月６日电  （记者陈金武、李希光）由中国科学院心理研究所和美国芝加哥大学的心理学家联合进行的一项调查研究表明：中国儿童比美国儿童更看重学习。
    调查结果表明，中、美儿童对学校的喜爱程度及对受教育的渴望程度存在着显著差异。这是因为中国儿童从入学起就受到“五爱”教育，更多地受到集体主义观念的教育；中国学生在校学习、活动的时间很长，学校的各项规章制度使小学生更多地把自己的注意力集中到学习上。而美国儿童虽然也受热爱祖国的教育，但在校时间很短，校外生活安排得充实、多彩，增加了某些课本上学不到的知识，提高了某种认识能力，但也分散了学生对课内学习的注意力。
    这项研究报告指出：美国一年级儿童每周用在看电视、运动和玩的时间平均为１８．４小时，中国儿童只用９．２小时；而每周用在阅读、做家庭作业或教育活动上的时间，美国一年级儿童平均为３．５小时，中国儿童为７．８小时。
    参加这项研究的学者认为，造成这种差异的原因除了受中、美两国传统教育的影响外，主要是因为中国儿童比起他们的美国同伴来，承受着更大的学习压力。因为他们必须通过统一的考试才能升入初中、高中、大学，而他们能考入哪所学校又与他们未来的就业有着直接的关系。他们所承受的这种压力是美国儿童从未感受到的。这种压力还波及到中国儿童的家长。美国家长并不看重分数，他们更注重儿童社会技能和认识能力的培养。
