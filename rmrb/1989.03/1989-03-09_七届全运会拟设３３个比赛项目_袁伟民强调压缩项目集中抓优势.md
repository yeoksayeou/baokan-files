The 7th National Games to Include 33 Competition Events
Yuan Weimin Emphasizes Project Reduction and Focus on Strengths

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 8th. - Reporter Li Beida reports: Vice Minister of the State Sports Commission Yuan Weimin revealed today at the National Sports Key Project Layout Meeting that the State Sports Commission plans to set up 33 competition events for the 7th National Games, with 28 of them being Olympic events. The remaining 5 non-Olympic events are gymnastics, fin swimming, wushu, go, and softball.

	Yuan Weimin said that reducing the number of competition events is to concentrate efforts on China's strength projects. He also pointed out that local sports commissions should find ways to prevent projects not included in the National Games from declining. Representatives from Beijing and the PLA, however, believe that projects such as parachuting and modern pentathlon, which are not included in the National Games, will inevitably face being cut. Local sports commission officials believe that the evaluation of local sports work is largely dependent on the results of the National Games, and the development of reduced projects is a specific and complex issue. The director of the Inner Mongolia Sports Commission, who has already cut the "three major ball games," said calmly, "If we consider the popularity and promote the all-around development of sports, we have no reason to do so. But now we are talking about gold medals, and we have to do it."

	Yuan Weimin pointed out several prominent issues in the sports sector at the meeting. He said that hard training is the foundation, and science is the key. Nowadays, everyone easily agrees on hard training, but scientific research is not going well. Some teams lack systematic training and are keen on invitation tournaments, essentially for appearance fees and high prizes, while the top-level national A-level league cannot motivate players' enthusiasm, which is very abnormal. When talking about the management of sports teams, Yuan Weimin still emphasized ideological education. He said that athletes cannot lack ideals, pursuits, and goals.

　　七届全运会拟设３３个比赛项目
    袁伟民强调压缩项目集中抓优势
    本报北京３月８日讯  记者李北大报道：国家体委副主任袁伟民今天在全国体育重点项目布局会议上透露，国家体委拟定第七届全运会设立３３个比赛项目，其中２８项为奥运会比赛项目。另外５个非奥运会项目是技巧、蹼泳、武术、围棋、垒球。
    袁伟民说，压缩比赛项目是为了集中精力抓我国的优势项目。他同时指出，各地体委要想办法使没有被列入全运会的项目不致衰落、萎缩。而北京、解放军等代表认为，未被列入全运会的跳伞、现代五项等项目，势必面临被砍掉的厄运。各地体委同志们认为，地方体育工作的评定，在很大程度上取决于全运会的成绩，压缩下来的项目如何发展是个具体而复杂问题。已砍掉“三大球”的内蒙古体委主任心情坦然地说，“要是考虑群众普及性，提倡体育全面发展，我们没有理由那么做，但现在讲的是金牌，我们不得不那么干了。”
    袁伟民在会上指出了目前体育界存在的几个突出问题。他说，苦练是基础，科学是关键，现在对于苦练大家认识容易统一，科研却开展得不太理想。一些运动队训练缺乏系统性，热衷于打邀请赛，说穿了无非是为了出场费、高额奖金，而全国最高一级的甲级联赛反倒调动不了队员们的热情，很不正常。在谈到运动队管理时，袁伟民仍然强调思想教育。他说，运动员不能没有理想、追求、目标。
