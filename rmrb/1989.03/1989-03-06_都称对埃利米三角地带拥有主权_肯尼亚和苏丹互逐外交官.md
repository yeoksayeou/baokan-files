Both countries claim sovereignty over the Ilemi Triangle

Kenya and Sudan expel diplomats

New China News Agency, Nairobi, March 5 - According to today's report by Kenya's Sunday Nation, Kenya and Sudan have each expelled two diplomats from the other country.

The Kenyan government expelled two senior Sudanese diplomats from Nairobi on March 3. The reason given was that a senior Sudanese diplomat had claimed at a press conference that a triangular area under Kenyan control on the border belonged to Sudan.

According to the report, the Sudanese government retaliated by ordering two Kenyan diplomats in Khartoum to leave within 48 hours.

Earlier this year, Sudan accused Kenya of including the disputed Ilemi Triangle in the northwestern part of Kenya in its map published last year.

However, Kenya's Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Ouko, said that the triangular area would forever be part of Kenya.

　　都称对埃利米三角地带拥有主权
    肯尼亚和苏丹互逐外交官
    新华社内罗毕３月５日电  据肯尼亚《星期日民族报》今天报道，肯尼亚和苏丹相互驱逐对方的两名外交官。
    肯尼亚政府３日驱逐了两名苏丹驻内罗毕的高级外交官。其理由是：一名苏丹高级外交官在记者招待会上声称，肯尼亚控制的边境地区的一个三角地带属于苏丹。
    据报道，苏丹政府针锋相对，４日命令驻喀土穆的两名肯尼亚外交官在４８小时内离境。
    今年早些时候，苏丹指责肯尼亚去年出版的地图中把肯尼亚西北部有争议的埃利米三角地带纳入了版图。
    但是，肯尼亚外交和国际合作部长奥科说，这个三角地带将永远是肯尼亚的一部分。
