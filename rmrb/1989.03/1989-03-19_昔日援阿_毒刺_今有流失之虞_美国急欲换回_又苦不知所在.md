The "Stinger" portable surface-to-air missiles, which were once used to aid Afghanistan, may now be at risk of being lost. The U.S. government is urgently trying to retrieve them but is struggling to locate them.

According to a report from our newspaper, due to concerns that "Stinger" missiles might fall into the hands of international terrorists and be used to attack U.S. targets, the Bush administration recently instructed the Central Intelligence Agency to exchange these missiles with the Afghan Mujahideen.

The "Stinger" missiles had previously inflicted heavy losses on Soviet aircraft in Afghanistan. After the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan, these advanced weapons lost their original purpose. The U.S. government plans to exchange advanced irrigation equipment, trucks, and medical supplies with the Afghan Mujahideen for these missiles, and even considers buying them back with money.

It is estimated that the Afghan Mujahideen still possess between 200 to 500 "Stinger" missiles. These advanced missiles are highly valued in the Middle East market. U.S. officials are concerned that the Mujahideen might sell them for profit, turning them into intimidating weapons in the hands of international terrorists. The problem is that the U.S. does not know which factions of the Mujahideen still have these missiles or where they are stored. Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said: "These missiles may never come back!"

　　昔日援阿“毒刺”　今有流失之虞
    美国急欲换回　又苦不知所在
    本报讯  由于担心“毒刺”式导弹会流入国际恐怖分子之手用以袭击美国的目标，布什政府不久前责成中央情报局向阿富汗游击队换回美国提供的这种导弹。
    “毒刺”式轻便肩射导弹曾在阿富汗战场上重创苏军飞机。苏军撤出阿富汗后，这种先进武器就失去了原有的作用。美国政府打算用先进的灌溉设备、卡车和医疗器械等，向阿富汗游击队换回这种导弹，甚至考虑用钱买回。
    据估计，阿富汗游击队目前仍掌握有２００—５００枚“毒刺”式导弹。这种先进的导弹在中东市场上身价颇高，美国官员担心游击队会转卖牟利，成为国际恐怖分子手中的威慑性武器。麻烦的是，美国并不清楚哪些派别的游击队还有这种导弹，以及储藏在什么地方。前国防部长卡卢奇说：“这些导弹也许永远回不来了！”
