Two hot topics: land and prices
— Minister of Agriculture He Kang answers questions from Chinese and foreign journalists

Reporters Ling Zhijun and Zhu Weiqun

Land issues and agricultural product prices have become the two hot topics of concern for Chinese and foreign journalists. At the press conference held on the afternoon of March 21 during the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, Minister of Agriculture He Kang answered questions from Chinese and foreign journalists.

Reuters (UK): In other socialist countries, such as Poland, farmers are allowed to buy land themselves. Is there a similar trend in China?

He Kang: Currently, we are improving the responsibility system for production quotas and extending the contract period. The ownership belongs to the collective, and farmers can transfer the usage rights after investing in the land. For wasteland that requires long-term development, we have extended the contract period to 50 years, and it can be inherited.

China Radio International: Can the increase in the state's grain procurement price offset the increase in grain production costs?

He Kang: This is also a concern of ours. This year, the state's grain procurement price will increase by 18%, but the increase in the price of production materials is even higher. Implementing "monopoly" can avoid high-price speculation in the middle, stabilizing the price of production materials. At the same time, for grain outside the contract procurement, farmers can sell it at market prices, obtaining partial compensation.

Economic Daily: There are reports that China is now the third-largest grain importer in the world and may become the largest grain importer. What is your opinion?

He Kang: Before 1984, China was always importing grain, with annual imports exceeding 10 million jin. In 1985 and 1986, our grain was net exported. After 1987, it became net imported again. Due to last year's disasters, imports this year will be more. As the Minister of Agriculture, I hope to import as little as possible.

United Daily News (Taiwan): How much grain does China need to import?

He Kang: This is mainly the responsibility of the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. If the harvest is good, there will be no need to import much.

Labor Daily (Yugoslavia): Currently, in some prosperous regions of China, farmers who have contracted land do not cultivate it themselves but hire farmers from poor regions to do so. What is the government's attitude towards this?

He Kang: For those who have contracted land but do not fulfill their responsibilities, their contract rights should be terminated according to regulations, and the land should be subcontracted to households that can better utilize the land. In the future, we will strengthen work in this area to prevent land from being left idle.

Izvestia (Soviet Union): Reports indicate that over the past 40 years, China has lost a large amount of arable land and has not strictly managed the existing arable land area. How do you, as the Minister of Agriculture, assess this situation?

He Kang: This is indeed a very serious problem. Over the past 40 years, China's per capita arable land has decreased from 1/5 hectare to 1/10 hectare. We have established the State Land Administration to strictly manage land, and at the same time, we collect arable land occupation tax to limit land occupation and use this tax to develop new land. Originally, 400,000 hectares of land were reduced each year, but last year, only 200,000 hectares were reduced.

United Daily News (Taiwan): I heard that grain coupons are no longer widely used in the south. Is this a challenge to central authority?

He Kang: Now, grain coupons have become negotiable instruments, reflecting the price difference between contracted grain and market grain. As far as I know, grain coupons are still valid everywhere.

Voice of America: You mentioned earlier that the government will increase some new tax sources, such as fruits and aquatic products. Can you talk about this in detail?

He Kang: Approximately 5% to 15% tax will be collected. Depending on the different varieties, high-profit products like sea cucumbers will be taxed higher. At the same time, if fruits are grown on wasteland, less tax or no tax will be collected, but if arable land is used to grow fruits, heavy taxes will be imposed.

　　两个热点：土地与价格          
    ——农业部长何康答中外记者问
    本报记者  凌志军  朱维群
    土地问题与农产品价格成为中外记者关注的两个热点。在七届人大二次会议２１日下午举行的记者招待会上，农业部长何康回答了中外记者的提问。
    英国路透社记者：别的社会主义国家，例如波兰，让农民自己买土地，中国有没有这种潮流？
    何康：我们现在采取的是完善联产责任制，延长承包合同期。所有权是集体的，农民在土地上投资后，可以有偿转让使用权。对于需要长期开发的荒山荒地，我们已把承包期延长到５０年，而且可以继承。
    中国国际广播电台记者：请问国家粮食收购价提高的幅度，能不能抵消生产粮食成本上升的幅度？
    何康：这也是我们担心的，今年国家粮食收购价将提高１８％，但生产资料上涨的幅度更高。实行“专营”就可以避免中间高价倒卖，使生产资料的价格稳定。同时在合同定购以外的粮食，农民可以按市价出售，得到部分补偿。
    《经济日报》记者：有报道说中国现在是世界第三大粮食进口国，而且还将成为最大的粮食进口国，请问你有何看法？
    何康：１９８４年以前，我国粮食一直进口，每年在１０００万斤以上，１９８５、１９８６年我们的粮食是净出口，１９８７年以后又成了净进口。由于去年的灾荒，今年进口更多一些。作为农业部长，我希望尽量少进口。
    台湾《联合报》记者：请问中国需要进口多少粮食？
    何康：这主要由商业部、经贸部负责。收成好，就不需要进口很多。
    南斯拉夫《劳动报》记者：目前中国有些富裕地区的农民承包土地自己不种，雇贫困地区的农民来种，政府对此有何看法？
    何康：对已经承包而不履行责任的农民，应按规定停止他的承包权力，把土地转包给更好利用土地的农户。今后我们将加强这方面的工作，不使土地荒废。
    苏联《消息报》记者：据报道，过去４０年中国失去了大量的耕地，也没有严格地管好现有的耕地面积，您作为农业部长，对这种形势如何估计？
    何康：这确实是一个非常严重的问题。中国４０年来人均占有的耕地从１／５公顷减少到１／１０公顷。我们已建立国家土地管理局，严格管理土地，同时收耕地占用税，限制占用土地，用这个税开发新的土地。原来每年要减少土地４０万公顷，去年减少了２０万公顷。
    台湾《联合报》记者：听说全国粮票在南方已不大通行，这是否是对中央权威的抵消？
    何康：现在粮票变成了有价证券，它反映订购粮价与市场粮价的差价。据我了解，粮票还是可以到处通行的。
    美国之音记者：你刚才讲政府将要增加一些新的税源，像水果水产等，你能不能具体地谈一谈？
    何康：大约要收５％到１５％的税。根据不同的品种，像海参等海珍品等高利润的产品，收得就高。同时，如果在荒地种水果，可以少征税和免税，占用耕地种水果，就要重税。
