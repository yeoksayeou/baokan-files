Setting off firecrackers is a traditional way of celebrating in our country, so firecracker production is very popular. Although in recent years there have been increasing calls to control the setting off of firecrackers, firecracker production is still thriving. Just in our region, there are more than 8,000 firecracker workshops. Due to poor production conditions and workers not strictly following regulations, shocking accidents occur frequently.

On the evening of January 20 this year, in the village of Zhaoqiao, Wangdian District, Lixin County, farmers Cai Dengbang and others were illegally producing firecrackers. They used a kerosene lamp for lighting, and someone accidentally knocked it over, igniting 2,500 firecrackers stored in the warehouse. Three people were burned to death and two were injured.

On December 4 last year, in the village of Dianji, Wuming District, Fuyang County, Wang Conghua's family was producing firecrackers when an electric motor sparked, igniting scattered gunpowder on the ground, causing a fire. This led to the explosion of 300 kilograms of primer stored in the courtyard. Wang's mother and one daughter were burned to death, another daughter was injured, 21 houses were burned down, and the economic loss was nearly 40,000 yuan.

According to statistics from the public security bureau of our region, in 1988, there were 15 firecracker production explosions in the Fuyang region, resulting in 25 deaths, 33 injuries, 51 houses destroyed, and direct economic losses of more than 85,000 yuan.

According to investigations, there are more than 5,000 illegal firecracker workshops in our region. These illegal producers use their homes as workshops, and some use open flames, which can easily lead to disasters. In the 15 explosions that occurred in our region last year, illegal producers accounted for 13 of them.

Each illegal firecracker workshop is like a powder keg. Once an explosion occurs, it not only destroys itself but also harms the surrounding area. We hope that relevant departments will strengthen management and resolutely shut down illegal firecracker workshops.

　　鞭炮生产留下的“死亡档案”
    燃放鞭炮是我国民间传统的庆贺方式，因此鞭炮生产十分红火。尽管近几年社会上要求控制燃放鞭炮的呼声越来越高，但目前鞭炮生产仍很兴旺，仅我地区就有生产鞭炮的作坊８０００多户。由于作坊生产条件差，制作者又不严格按规定操作，触目惊心的伤亡事故时有发生。
    今年１月２０日晚，利辛县望盯区赵桥村农民蔡登榜等人非法生产鞭炮时，用煤油灯照明，有一人不慎将煤油灯碰翻，引燃库存的２５００多盘鞭炮，烧死３人，烧伤２人。
    去年１２月４日，阜阳县伍明区店集乡王从华家在生产鞭炮时，由于电动机打火，引燃散落在地面上的零星火药，导致失火，引爆院内已配好的３００公斤引药，王的母亲和一个女儿被烧死，另一个女儿被烧伤，烧毁房屋２１间，经济损失近４万元。
    据我地区公安处统计，１９８８年，阜阳地区因生产鞭炮而发生爆炸事故１５起，死亡２５人，受伤３３人，炸毁房屋５１间，直接经济损失８．５万多元。
    据调查，我地区非法生产烟花爆竹的个体作坊有５０００多户。这些非法生产者把自家的住房当作作坊，有的明火作业，极易造成灾祸。在去年我地区发生的１５起爆炸事故中，非法生产者就占１３户。
    一家家非法生产鞭炮的作坊犹如一个个火药库，一旦爆炸，不仅毁灭自己，而且殃及四邻。希望有关部门加强管理，坚决取缔非法生产鞭炮的个体作坊。
