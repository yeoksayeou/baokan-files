Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 24th.

The current situation of energy, raw materials, and transportation in China is quite tense. The State Council has decided to take measures to alleviate this tension.

Vice Minister of the State Planning Commission, Ye Qing, revealed this information during a meeting with the Henan delegation to the National People's Congress on March 23rd. Ye Qing explained the current situation regarding the supply of energy, raw materials, and transportation, as well as the reasons behind this tension. He emphasized that gradually easing this tension is a crucial step in increasing effective supply and stabilizing the economy. He disclosed that after multiple discussions, the State Council has decided to implement the following measures:

	— Increasing coal production is the fundamental solution to the current energy supply-demand imbalance. This year, coal production will increase by 10 million tons, with additional coal supplied to the North China, Northeast, East China, and Central China power grids. For local coal mines in Shanxi, in addition to maintaining existing preferential policies, new financial compensation measures will be implemented.

	— Implementing unified management of coal transportation, establishing a coal transportation leadership group to coordinate and manage coal transportation, and implementing unified transportation prices for both planned and non-planned coal. This will eliminate additional charges for excess transportation and non-planned coal, reduce intermediary links, free up some funds, and stabilize coal prices.

	— Strictly adhering to the allocated power usage indicators, prioritizing the allocation of power for key needs such as coal, petroleum, steel, non-ferrous metals, fertilizers, and transportation.

	— Adjusting prices appropriately to address the operational losses in the coal and petroleum transportation industries.

	— Starting this year, the state will implement a policy of prioritizing investment in energy, transportation, and raw materials infrastructure. All investments will see an increase.

　　能源原材料交通运输紧张        
    国务院采取五项缓解措施
    新华社北京３月２４日电  （记者周晓农）国家计委副主任叶青２３日参加人大河南代表团会议时透露，我国当前能源、原材料、交通运输相当紧张，国务院已决定采取措施缓解。
    叶青代表介绍目前能源、原材料供应和交通运输紧张的状况及形成紧张状况的原因。他说，逐步缓解这种紧张状况是增加有效供给，稳定经济的重要环节。他透露，国务院经过多次研究，已决定采取以下措施：
    ——增加煤炭生产，是当前解决能源供需矛盾的根本措施。今年增加煤炭产量１０００万吨，增供华北、东北、华东、华中４大电网用煤。对山西地方煤矿，除原有的优惠政策不变外，还将实行新的资金补偿措施。
    ——实行煤炭运输统一管理，成立煤炭调运领导小组，统筹安排和协调煤炭运输，对计划内外的煤炭实行统一运价，取消超运加价和计划外加价，减少中间环节，挤出部分资金，平抑煤炭价格。
    ——严格按照分配指标用电，优先安排煤炭、石油、钢铁、有色金属、化肥和交通运输等重点需要。
    ——适当调整价格，解决煤炭、石油运输行业经营亏损问题。
    ——从今年起，国家对能源、交通、原材料等基建投资实行重点倾斜政策，各项投资都有增加。
