Lee Kuan Yew on Singapore-China Relations
Singapore-China Relations to Follow Indonesia-China Resumption of Diplomatic Ties
Singapore Adheres to the One-China Policy

BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Singapore evening newspaper on March 9, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said on March 8 during a meeting with Taiwanese journalists that regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations between Singapore and China, he does not have a specific timeline, but it will definitely be after Indonesia and China resume diplomatic ties.

Lee Kuan Yew said that China and Indonesia will probably take about a year to complete the procedures for resuming diplomatic ties, and Singapore may establish diplomatic relations with China a few months after that.

Lee Kuan Yew reiterated Singapore's "one-China" policy. He said that Singapore had already declared its recognition of only one China in the United Nations as early as 1971.

According to a report by Taiwan's "China Times," Lee Kuan Yew said during the interview that after Singapore establishes diplomatic relations with China, it will not affect the current economic relations between Singapore and Taiwan, but Singapore will acknowledge in its diplomacy that China is the sole legitimate government.

    新加坡坚持只有一个中国的立场
    新华社北京３月１０日电  据新加坡９日晚报报道，新加坡总理李光耀８日在接受台湾记者的来访时说，对于新加坡与中国建交一事，他并没有一个时间表，但肯定是在印尼与中国复交之后。
    李光耀说，中国和印尼大概要花一年的时间来完成复交的程序，而新加坡可能要在此之后再过几个月后才能够与中国建交。
    李光耀重申了新加坡政府所持的“一个中国”立场。他说，新加坡早在１９７１年就在联合国表明了只有一个中国的立场。
    另据台湾的《中国时报》报道，李光耀在接受采访时说，新加坡与中国建交后，不会影响到目前的新台经济关系，但新加坡在外交上承认中国是唯一的政府。
