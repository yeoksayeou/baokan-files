	Ningxia Forestry Bureau Urges Media to Focus on Problems in Forestry Reporting
	According to Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, March 14 — On the eve of Arbor Day, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Forestry Bureau held a press conference, urging the media to pay attention to the declining situation in forestry construction and hoping that in forestry reporting, less emphasis will be placed on achievements and more on studying problems.

	In recent years, the autonomous region has made significant achievements in forestry construction. However, since 1986, the annual seedling cultivation area in the entire autonomous region has only been over 5,000 mu, while the actual demand is 12,000 mu. This year, out of 19 counties and cities, 10 have already experienced a shortage of seedlings.

　　宁夏林业厅吁请新闻界
    林业报道要少吹
    据新华社银川３月１４日电  （记者王漫沧）植树节前夕，宁夏回族自治区林业厅举行记者座谈会，吁请新闻界注意林业建设的滑坡现象，希望在林业报道中少吹成绩，多研究问题。
    近几年来，自治区的林业建设取得了很大成绩。但是，从１９８６年开始，全自治区每年的育苗面积只有５０００多亩，而实际需要量为１．２万亩。今年１９个县市中，已有１０个县发生苗木短缺。
