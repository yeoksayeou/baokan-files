Title: This Heart Is Beyond Control

In recent years, the supplement sections of newspapers have been most welcoming of miscellaneous essays, followed by periodicals, and then publishers. This is not hard to understand, as miscellaneous essays are inherently time-sensitive. If you write a miscellaneous essay addressing current issues, newspapers can publish it within a couple of days if they deem it necessary; periodicals, with a publication cycle of at least three months, will make it seem outdated by the time it comes out; and by the time you slowly compile, edit, print, and bind it into a book, and readers buy it from a bookstore, it will have become an ancient account book. Lu Xun advocated that texts attacking contemporary issues should perish along with those issues. Any miscellaneous essay writer who follows this teaching has never placed the idea of "permanence" at the forefront of their mind, and if they can't publish a book, they won't, but they will still write.

That being said, having the opportunity to compile and publish a collection is still a joy. It's not that the issues haven't been resolved, but rather a hope to leave some traces, perhaps to remind future generations of some lessons learned, and to avoid paying the price again. Now, I can compile my miscellaneous essays from the past three years into a small collection and hand it over for publication, all with this hope in mind.

As for the order of the articles, they are still arranged by the time of writing. Looking at the table of contents, I can't help but laugh at myself: 11 pieces in 1986, 19 pieces in 1988, and only 3 pieces in 1987, forming a perfect wasp-waisted shape. Was I particularly lazy in 1987? I remember not stopping my pen, but most of what I wrote were book reviews, prefaces, and reading notes, which are compiled in another collection. Broadly speaking, those can also be considered miscellaneous essays, as they discuss neither pure literature nor pure academia. I have never understood what pure literature or pure academia is; it's just that the sources, methods, and directions are somewhat different from those of miscellaneous essays that directly face reality, with a slightly stronger "literary flavor," but they are all "mixed flavors." That collection is titled *Mixed-Flavor Reading*. As for why I wrote fewer direct-facing-reality essays in 1987, I can't quite remember, but it's probably best not to delve into it. Not writing doesn't mean not thinking; if you don't write for a while, you will eventually write. Things that weren't written in time, if you think about them in your heart, are not without benefit. When you write them out later, they might be deeper and more enduring than immediate writings. I am somewhat numb, and looking at these three years of miscellaneous essays, there are almost none that are based on the latest "current events." What I am concerned about can only be said to be "worldly affairs," things that I have thought about for a long time. I dare not say that I have reached the depth and endurance of writing, as I lack precisely this. It is always superficial and easily exhausted, which is related to one's cultivation and learning, and there is no way around it. However, it is still enough to prove: thought is something that no one can stop. You can make someone not write, but you can't make someone not think; even if you want to stop yourself from thinking, you can't. An ancient woman poet wrote in a poem titled *Lady Wenjun Listening to the Zither*: "In the past, just laughing at Lady Wenjun, who would have believed that the silk strings could mislead one's body? Today, before playing, the heart is already in chaos, this heart is beyond control." It has long been said. My 1987 was a year when I did not believe that silk strings could mislead one's body, thinking that I could forget worldly affairs and extinguish all anger and delusion. The result was that in that year, I wrote those things that, although slightly "literary," are all "mixed flavors," and the following year, I wrote even more miscellaneous essays. It is evident that "this heart is beyond control" is indeed an unbreakable truth. Fortunately, there is an article titled *I Am Also Thinking...*, which I remember was not the original title; this was changed by the editor when it was published, and it can be used to serve as the title for the entire book. In the future, whether I will write miscellaneous essays, how many I will write, and whether I will be able to publish a book, are all difficult to say, but "I am also thinking..." will probably not change.

　　“此心原自不由人”
    舒芜
    这几年，报纸的副刊上最欢迎杂文，期刊次之，出版社又次之。这本来不难理解，杂文本来就是时间性很强的。你针对时弊写的杂文，日报上只要认为有必要，两三天见报也办得到；期刊出版周期最短三个月，登出来已近于明日黄花；等你慢慢结集，编发校印，装订成书，直到读者从书店买到，更成了古久先生的陈年帐簿了。鲁迅主张，攻击时弊的文字，当与时弊一同消亡。凡遵奉他这个遗教的杂文作者，从来不把什么“永久性”念念不忘地放在心儿里，不能出书就不出吧，写还是要写的。
    话虽如此说，能有结集出版的机会，也还是高兴的。倒不是高兴时弊仍未消亡，而是希望籍此留下一点痕迹，或者可以让后代人记得曾经有过什么样的一些教训，尽量避免重付代价。我现在能将三年间发表的杂文编成小集，交付出版，便是抱着这样的希望。
    至于文章次序，仍依写作时间为序。排成目录一看，自己有些好笑：１９８６年１１篇，１９８８年１９篇，而中间１９８７年只有３篇，恰恰成了一个蜂腰形。难道是我１９８７年特别懒么？记得倒也没有停笔，不过写的多半是书评、序跋、读书笔记之类，编在另一个集子里了。广义地说，那些也可以算作杂文，因为谈的都不是纯文艺、纯学术，我也从来不懂何为纯文艺、纯学术，无非是取材、取径、取向等等与直面现实的杂文有些不同，“书味儿”稍稍多一些，可是又都“串味儿”，那个集子就题名为《串味读书》。至于１９８７年何以少写直面现实之文，我记不大清楚，反正是宜粗不宜细。记不清也罢了。
    不写不等于不想，一时不写，迟早要写，没有及时写出的，放在心里多想一想，也不无好处，将来再写出来，或许比即感即发之文深厚耐读一些。我是比较麻木的，一查这三年的杂文，取材于最新鲜的“时事”的几乎没有，所关心的只能说都是“世事”，都是想来想去想了好久的事情。我岂敢说已经达到了深厚耐读的境界，缺少的正是这个，总是伤于浅露易尽，这关乎功力学养，没有法子。可是，它仍然足以证明：思想是任谁无法阻止的。要人不写，办得到；要人不想，办不到；甚至，自己要自己不想，也办不到。古之某才女题《文君听琴图》诗云：“昔年刚笑卓文君，岂信丝桐解误身。今日未弹先已乱，此心原自不由人。”早已慨乎言之。我的１９８７年，是我不相信丝桐误身，自以为可以忘怀世事，泯绝嗔痴的一年。结果，当年便写下了那些虽略带“书味儿”，但全都“串味儿”的东西，次年更是大写起杂文来，可见“此心原自不由人”确是颠扑不破的至理。恰好有一篇文章的题目是《我也正在想……》，记得原来不是这个题目，这是发表时编者给改的，恰好可以用来兼作全书之名。将来杂文还写不写，写多少，出不出得成书，都很难说，只有“我也正在想……”大致不会变的。
