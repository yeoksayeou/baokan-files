The reforms in Soviet higher education can be broadly divided into two periods: in the late 1960s and early 1970s, a number of comprehensive institutions combining teaching, production, and scientific research were established in universities to accumulate experience in cultivating talents; in the subsequent period, the pace of reform accelerated, with the policy of integrating education, production, and scientific research and granting more autonomy to universities.

The reforms in Soviet higher education began in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some of the basic ideas of reform proposed at that time were gradually implemented in the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s.

	Establishing a number of comprehensive institutions combining teaching, production, and scientific research in universities

	At that time, the Soviet Union anticipated that the rapid development of modern science and technology required specialized personnel to have a solid foundation and strong adaptability. The goal of cultivating talents with a broad professional background was proposed, and a series of major measures were taken to establish a number of comprehensive institutions combining teaching, production, and scientific research in universities to explore new paths for cultivating talents and accumulate valuable experience.

	However, due to well-known objective reasons, the political and economic life of the Soviet Union was in a state of "stagnation" during this period, and some reforms often could not break through institutional issues, thus failing to achieve breakthrough progress. The reform and development of higher education also could not avoid being affected.

	In 1985, after Gorbachev became the General Secretary of the CPSU, the situation changed. That year, the Central Committee of the CPSU held a June Plenum to specifically study issues related to education, science, and technology. At the 27th Congress of the CPSU held in February 1986, Gorbachev emphasized: "The speed and depth of our educational reforms are still not satisfactory, and there is a trend of slowing development in the educational sector compared to the world level. If this trend cannot be reversed in the short term, it means that we will fall into the most dangerous state of social backwardness, and it will take decades to get rid of this backwardness." On June 1, 1986, the Central Committee of the CPSU proposed the "Basic Guidelines for Reforming Higher and Secondary Specialized Education" (draft) for nationwide discussion. About 12.5 million people participated in the discussion, and approximately 200,000 opinions and suggestions were received. On March 21, 1987, this "Basic Guidelines" was officially approved and published by the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR, followed by the publication of five related resolutions on improving the quality of talent cultivation and utilization, improving the cultivation of university faculty and scientific research personnel, strengthening scientific research in universities, increasing the salaries of university staff, and improving the material conditions and living conditions of university students.

	Establishing connections between universities and national economic departments and scientific research institutions

	The basic approach of this reform is the integration of education, production, and scientific research, and to establish new connections between universities and relevant departments of the national economy and scientific research institutions. According to the "Basic Guidelines" and related resolutions, the Soviet government increased its investment in higher education. In addition, the method of directed and partially paid training was implemented (from 1988 to 1990, the production sector needed to pay 3,000 rubles for one university student, which was about 25% of the training costs), and the funds for higher education could roughly be doubled. Furthermore, several specific measures were stipulated to promote the scientific research work of universities. The original 503 specialties were further reduced to 299; the teaching plan was significantly adjusted, and the classroom teaching hours were reduced by nearly one-third. The cultivation of high-level talents was further emphasized, and universities and research institutes of the Academy of Sciences with conditions opened three-year doctoral programs. The USSR State Committee for Higher Education canceled tens of thousands of documents previously issued, and this alone is enough to show that the steps of this reform are very significant.

	Reforming the management system within higher education and universities

	With the gradual expansion of higher education reform, there have been many new developments in the reform of the management system within higher education and universities. On March 8, 1988, the Council of Ministers of the USSR announced the abolition of the USSR State Committee for Higher and Secondary Specialized Education, the USSR Ministry of Education, and the USSR State Committee for Vocational and Technical Education, and the establishment of the new USSR State Committee for People's Education (abbreviated as "USSR State Education Committee"), with the personnel of the original three departments reduced by half. The aim is to strengthen the centralized leadership of educational work and macro-management. Other new measures related to higher education reform are more concentrated in the "Regulations of the USSR Higher Education Institutions" (draft) published last October.

	Compared with the "Regulations of the USSR Higher Education Institutions" promulgated in 1969, the new "Regulations" (draft) have the following new features:

	First, the new "Regulations" (draft) propose: "Universities, within the scope of the state demand plan, complete teaching, scientific research, and production work on the basis of signing contracts with university management agencies (USSR State Education Committee, the national education departments of the union republics, and other relevant business departments), and can also use the method of signing contracts directly with business departments and enterprises." "Departments and higher authorities can only issue instructions to universities based on the authority prescribed by law." There are also some decentralization provisions, such as universities having the right to independently determine their organizational and management structure and the right to autonomously use funds from any source, strengthening the position of universities as independent legal entities.

	Second, the new "Regulations" (draft) also list the production and sale of various goods (including goods produced in cooperation with foreign companies), providing paid services to residents as one of the main tasks of universities. Schools can open various paid preparatory classes, advanced courses, sell idle equipment, tools, materials, and even cooperate with capitalist country companies to conduct import and export business, which was unimaginable in the past.

	Third, post-university education (including cadre training and retraining) occupies a relatively prominent position in the new "Regulations" (draft). If necessary, those who have received higher education can receive a second higher education.

	Fourth, compared with the past, it is more open and pays more attention to international exchanges in higher education.

	Fifth, the approach in ideological and political education has also changed, emphasizing more on communist moral education.

	The reform of Soviet higher education is still ongoing, and some newly emerging problems need to be further addressed. For example, after the work of universities is based on economic accounting, the issue of whether it is reasonable to receive higher education for free has been raised and has become a topic of discussion. There are also different opinions in society about some reform measures. Some people in the Soviet industrial sector believe that strengthening the scientific research and technological development work of universities is not feasible because this is not moving forward towards the 21st century, but rather a step backward. The research center should be transferred to industrial enterprises. The "University Bulletin" will organize a public debate on this issue.

	The practices and trends of Soviet higher education reform have raised many new questions for people.

　　苏联高等教育改革不断深化
    苏联高等教改大致可分两个时期：在６０年代末和７０年代初，建起一批高校教学、生产和科研综合体，为培养人才积累经验；在此后时期，改革步子加快，方针是实行教育、生产和科研一体化并向高校放权。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    苏联的高等教育改革起步于６０年代末和７０年代初，那时提出的一些改革基本思想在７０年代和８０年代前半期不断得到实施。
    　　　　建立一批高校教学、生产和科研的综合体
    当时，苏联预计到现代科学技术的迅速发展要求专门人才有良好的基础训练和较强的适应能力，提出了培养专业面宽的人才目标并采取一系列重大措施，建立了一批高校教学、生产、科研综合体为探索人才培养的新途径积累了宝贵的经验。
    但是，由于众所周知的客观原因，这一时期苏联的政治和经济生活处于“停滞”状态，一些改革往往因不能触及体制上的问题而无法取得突破性进展。高等教育的改革及发展也不能不受到影响。
    １９８５年戈尔巴乔夫就任苏共总书记后，情况有了新的变化。当年，苏共中央召开六月全会，专门研究文教和科技发展的问题。在１９８６年２月举行的苏共二十七大上，戈尔巴乔夫强调指出：“我们进行教育改革的速度和深度还不能令人满意，已经出现了教育领域同世界水平相比较发展缓慢的趋势。如果不能在短期内扭转这一趋势，就意味着我们将要陷入社会最危险的落后状态，而要摆脱这种落后，就要几十年的时间。”１９８６年６月１日，苏共中央提出《改革高等和中等专业教育的基本方针》（草案），供全国讨论。参加讨论的有１２５０万人，收到的意见和建议约２０万条。１９８７年３月２１日这个《基本方针》经苏共中央和苏联部长会议批准正式公布，随即又公布了改进人才培养质量和使用、改进高校师资和科研干部培养工作、加强高校的科学研究、提高高校工作人员工资、改进高校学生的物质待遇和生活条件等问题的５个有关决议。
    　　　　建立高校同国民经济部门和科研机构之间联系
    这次改革的基本路子是教育、生产和科研的一体化，按新的方式来建立高校同国民经济各有关部门和科研机构之间的相互联系。根据《基本方针》及有关决议，苏联政府增加对高等学校的投入，再加上实行定向和部分有偿培养的办法（１９８８年到１９９０年期间，生产部门要一名大学生需支付３０００卢布，约占培养经费的２５％左右），高等教育的经费大体可增加一倍。此外，还规定了一些有利于促进高校科学研究工作的具体措施。原有的５０３种专业进一步缩减为２９９种；教学计划作了大幅度的调整，课堂教学时数压缩近１／３。高层次人才的培养进一步得到重视，有条件的重点高校和科学院的研究所开设三年制的博士生部。苏联高教部取消了过去颁发的上万个文件，仅此一例，足以说明这次改革的步子是很大的。
    　　　　改革高等教育和高校内部的管理体制
    随着高等教育的改革逐渐铺开，高等教育内部和高等学校内部管理体制的改革也出现了不少新的进展。１９８８年３月８日，苏联部长会议宣布撤销苏联高等和中等专业教育部、苏联教育部和苏联国家职业技术教育委员会，成立新的苏联国家国民教育委员会（简称“苏联国家教委”），原有三个部委的人员编制削减一半。旨在加强对教育工作的集中领导，加强宏观管理。其他有关高等教育改革的新措施比较集中地体现在去年１０月公布的《苏联高等学校条例》（草案）之中。
    与１９６９年颁布的《苏联高等学校条例》相比，新的《条例》（草案）有以下新特点：
    一、新的《条例》草案提出：“高校在国家需求计划范围内与高校管理机关（苏联国家教委、各加盟共和国国民教育部委及其他主管业务部委）在签订合同的基础上完成教学、科研和生产工作，也可用与业务部门和企业直接签订合同的办法进行。”“部委及其他上级机关只能根据立法规定的权限向高校发布指示。”其他还有一些放权规定，如高校有权独立确定其组织和管理结构，有权自主使用任何来源的资金等，加强高校作为独立法人的地位。
    二、新的《条例》（草案）把生产和销售各种商品（其中包括与外国公司合作生产的商品），为居民提供有偿服务也列为高校的主要任务之一。学校可以开办各种收费的升学培训班、进修班、出售闲置设备、工具、材料，甚至可以与资本主义国家公司合作进行进出口业务。这在过去是很难想象的。
    三、大学后的教育（包括干部进修及再培养）在新的《条例》（草案）中占有相当突出的位置，如有需要，还可以让受过高等教育的人接受第二次高等教育。
    四、较之过去，更为开放，更重视高等教育的国际交流。
    五、在思想政治教育方面提法也有所改变，比较强调共产主义道德教育。
    苏联高等教育改革还在进行，一些新出现的问题还有待于进一步解决。比如高校的工作建立在经济核算的基础上之后，免费接受高等教育是否合理的问题就被提了出来，成为讨论的话题。对有些改革的措施社会上也有不同的看法。苏联工业部门就有人认为，加强高校的科研和科技开发工作是行不通的，因为这不是朝２１世纪向前运动，而是后退。科研中心应该转移到工业企业中去。苏联《高校通报》将就此问题组织公开辩论。
    苏联高等教育改革的做法和动向向人们提出了不少新的思考题。
