On March 22nd in the afternoon, in the Beijing Hall of the Great Hall of the People, the Beijing delegation reviewed the government work report. Li Peng, in his dual capacity as a National People's Congress delegate and Premier of the State Council, participated in the discussion and listened to the delegates' opinions on the government work report.

	"Don't neglect agriculture when it's low, cut it when it's high, and ignore it when it's just right"
	People's Congress delegate Zhang Zhanlin (Party Secretary of Liu Minying Village, Daxing County) said that in recent years, many young people in rural areas are unwilling to engage in agricultural production. Go to the fields and see, those working in agriculture are mostly over 50 years old. He hopes that the government and relevant departments will not "neglect agriculture when it's low, cut it when it's high, and ignore it when it's just right."

	Li Peng said, "Our country has so many people, and the food problem can only be solved by ourselves. We must pay great attention to agricultural production and manage it tightly."

	"Hope our Premier can be the Education Premier"
	People's Congress delegate Tao Xiping (Director and Party Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau) introduced the achievements, difficulties, and problems of Beijing's education work in recent years, especially the experience of raising funds through multiple channels in some places. Li Peng said, "Now there are many single children, and every family spends money on clothes, toys, and candy for their children without hesitation. To improve educational conditions, let parents and grandparents contribute a little money. As long as the reasons are explained clearly, everyone will support it."

	People's Congress delegate Tao Dayong (Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Financial and Economic Committee, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League) said excitedly, "From a national perspective, education is still in a potential crisis, with 'soil erosion,' and an unstable teaching staff. In 5 to 10 years, the problem will be very serious and must be addressed. Now the idea that studying is useless is very influential. University students are called 'Trotskyists'—studying for the 'TOEFL' to go abroad; those who don't study are called 'Mahjong players'—playing mahjong. This is a strange phenomenon. We should take this problem seriously. The U.S. President is an education president. I hope our Premier can be the education premier."

	Li Peng said, "The education problem is indeed very serious, such as teachers' salaries and educational facilities. The central government will hold a meeting to specifically discuss education issues."

	"Family planning needs hard measures"
	People's Congress delegate Hu Yamei (Director of Beijing Children's Hospital) said that although the government work report has a special section on family planning, it is not strict enough. If you "advocate" and they don't listen, what do you do? Those with 'genuine difficulties' can have a second child, but what constitutes 'genuine difficulties'? It should still rely on the law, with hard measures. It is not allowed to 'buy children.' Some people would rather pay thousands or tens of thousands of yuan in fines to have children. Effective measures should be taken to stop the 'childbearing guerrillas.'"

	Li Peng deeply agreed, saying, "The rapid increase in population is indeed a major obstacle to China's economic development."

	"The problem of coal shortage has been reported for a long time"
	People's Congress delegate Yan Chengzong (Director of the Beijing Municipal Economic Commission) said, "Now everyone knows that coal is in short supply. In fact, last October, we sent people to investigate coal mines and railways in Shanxi and found this problem, and repeatedly reported it to the relevant departments. However, the relevant departments insisted that there is coal, just that it cannot be transported. Until the problem was fully exposed, it was taken seriously. The situation we reported early was not believed by the relevant departments."

	Li Peng said, "We originally received information that Shanxi has plenty of coal. The important reason for the decline in Shanxi's coal production is that many small coal mines are losing money and stopping production. In the future, some preferential policies should be adopted to support the production of small coal mines in Shanxi."

　　北京代表与总理议大事
    本报记者  于宁
    ３月２２日下午在人民大会堂北京厅，北京代表团审议政府工作报告。李鹏以全国人大代表和国务院总理的双重身份参加讨论，听取代表们对政府工作报告的意见。
  　　　　对农业不要“少了喊，多了砍，不多不少没人管”
    人大代表张占林（大兴县长子营乡留民营村党支部书记）说，近几年，很多农村青年不愿意从事农业生产。到地里去看看，干农活的差不多都是５０岁以上的人。希望政府和有关部门对农业不要“少了喊，多了砍，不多不少没人管”。
    李鹏说，我们国家人这么多，吃饭问题只能靠我们自己解决。对农业生产要十分重视，抓得很紧。
    　　　　“希望我们的总理当教育总理”
    人大代表陶西平（北京市教育局局长、党组书记）介绍了近几年来北京市教育工作取得的成绩和存在的困难和问题，特别是一些地方多渠道筹集经费的经验。李鹏说，现在独生子女很多，每个家庭为孩子买衣服、玩具、糖，花钱都不心疼。为改善教育条件让父母和爷爷、奶奶出点钱，只要把道理讲清楚，大家是会拥护的。
    人大代表陶大镛（全国人大财经委员会副主任、民盟中央副主席）很激动地说，从全国来看，教育还是陷在潜在的危机，“水土流失”，教师队伍不稳，５年到１０年以后，问题会非常严重，必须正视。现在读书无用论影响很厉害。大学里读书的叫“托派”——念“托福”，出国留学；不读书的叫“麻派”——打麻将。这是一种奇怪的现象。这个问题看得严重一点好。美国总统是教育总统。希望我们的总理是教育总理。
    李鹏说，教育的问题的确很严重，例如教师待遇、教育设施等，中央将开会专门讨论教育问题。
    　　　　“计划生育要有硬性措施”
    人大代表胡亚美（北京儿童医院院长）说，政府工作报告中虽然有专门一段讲了计划生育，但是讲得不够硬，你“提倡”，他不听怎么办？“确有实际困难”的可以生二胎，什么叫“实际困难”？还是应当靠法制，有硬性措施。不能允许“花钱买孩子”，有的人宁可挨几千元、一万元的罚，也要生。对“生孩子游击队”也要采取有效的措施予以制止。
    李鹏深表赞同地说，人口迅速增长的确是妨碍我国经济发展相当主要的原因。
    　　　　“煤炭吃紧的问题我们早就反映了”
    人大代表阎承宗（北京市经委主任）说，现在大家都知道煤炭紧缺，其实去年１０月我们就派人到山西的煤矿和铁路去调查过，发现了这个问题，并连续多次向主管部门反映。可是主管部门坚持说有煤，就是运不出来。以至于到问题充分暴露出来以后才引起重视。我们早就反映的情况，主管部门不相信。
    李鹏说，我们原来得到的信息一直是山西的煤炭不少。山西煤炭产量下降的重要原因是许多小煤窑亏损、停产，今后要采取一些优惠政策支持山西小煤窑的生产。
