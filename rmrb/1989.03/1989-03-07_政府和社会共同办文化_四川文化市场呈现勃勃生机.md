Art forms such as Sichuan opera, symphony orchestras, and ballet, alongside commercial dance halls, billiards, and video rentals, are bringing vibrancy to Sichuan's cultural market.

According to the provincial cultural bureau, last year, 200 million people participated in various cultural market activities across the province. Chengdu alone has nearly a hundred commercial dance halls, and advertisements for various video tapes are ubiquitous on the streets, attracting much attention.

Sichuan's cultural budget has consistently been at the bottom of the national rankings, and in recent years, it has been decreasing by approximately 20% annually. To meet the growing demand for spiritual and cultural needs, a wave of socially-driven cultural initiatives is emerging. Various forms of socially-run cultural and artistic groups and activities are springing up.

In Ziyang County, the acrobat Zhou Zhaowen and his family of five perform as a "specialized acrobatic household," traveling from village to village. They are not only popular at the grassroots level but have also recently qualified to participate in the second China Arts Festival.

Recently, Sichuan Province has adjusted and streamlined one-third of its various professional performing arts troupes, reducing personnel by over 8,000, a rate of adjustment that is among the highest in the country. Most of the personnel affected by these adjustments have moved on to the "second stage" of cultural operations. Currently, the number of performance troupes organized by society far exceeds those run by cultural departments.

Cultural experts generally agree that the flourishing of the cultural market is a product of the commodity economy. However, some issues arising from the current development are worth noting. The relative emphasis on highbrow versus lowbrow culture, the true motives behind some young people's engagement in billiards, and similar phenomena all indicate that strengthening the management of the cultural market is urgent.

### 政府和社会共同办文化  四川文化市场呈现勃勃生机

　　政府和社会共同办文化
    四川文化市场呈现勃勃生机
    本报成都３月６日电  记者陈华报道：以川剧、交响乐、芭蕾舞为代表的艺术与以营业性舞会、台球、录相为代表的大众文化娱乐并存，给四川的文化市场带来了生机。
    据省文化厅统计，全省去年有２亿人次参加了文化市场的各类活动。成都已有近百家营业性舞厅，各种录相片广告充斥街头，引人注目。
    四川的文化事业费用一直居全国之末，近年还在以每年约２０％的速度递减。为了满足人们对精神文化日益增长的需要，一个社会办文化的热潮正在兴起，各种形式的社会办的文化艺术团体和文化活动应运而生。
    资阳县杂技艺人周召文全家５口以“杂技专业户”的形式走村串乡演出，不仅在基层广受欢迎，最近还获得了进军第二届中国艺术节的资格。
    不久前，四川省已调整和精简了１／３的各类专业艺术表演团体，精简人员８０００多人，调整幅度在全国名列前茅。调整下来的大多数人员走向了文化经营的“第二舞台”。现在社会举办的各种演出团体数量已大大超过文化部门主办的专业剧团。
    文化界人士普遍认为，文化市场的勃兴是商品经济的产物。目前发展中的一些问题值得注意。对雅俗文化的倚轻倚重、一些台球桌上的青年已不再掩饰娱乐后的真正动机——以赌博求得刺激，诸如此类现象的出现都说明：加强文化市场的管理已刻不容缓。
