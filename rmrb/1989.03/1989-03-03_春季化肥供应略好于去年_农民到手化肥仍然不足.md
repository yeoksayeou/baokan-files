Xiaojunxi reports from the Ministry of Agriculture that during this year's spring farming season, the national supply of fertilizers is slightly better than last year. The supply through the supply and marketing cooperatives has increased by approximately 7% compared to the same period last year, with most of it already delivered to rural areas. However, due to high prices and a shortage of funds, farmers are still short of fertilizers, which warrants serious attention from all regions.

The specialized management of fertilizers has effectively controlled the chaotic situation of multiple channels of buying and selling. Historically, the demand for fertilizers in the first half of the year accounts for about 60% of the annual usage. The supply and marketing cooperatives have currently stockpiled 53 million tons of fertilizers, which is about 85% of the current demand. The prominent issue at present is that farmers are not purchasing enough fertilizers. In previous years, farmers would typically have 20-30% of their spring farming fertilizers ready by this time. This year, due to a lack of funds and the continued high prices of fertilizers, farmers' enthusiasm for purchasing fertilizers has been affected. The main reason for the high fertilizer prices is that some regions have not implemented the State Council's regulations on fertilizer prices. Provinces, prefectures, and counties have set their own comprehensive sales prices, leading to a chaotic situation where one commodity has multiple prices, creating opportunities for illegal resale. According to a survey in Dalian City, various fertilizers have increased in price by an average of 45% compared to last year.

### 春季化肥供应略好于去年  农民到手化肥仍然不足

    春季化肥供应略好于去年
    农民到手化肥仍然不足
    本报讯　记者肖俊熙从农业部获悉：今年春耕生产期间，全国化肥供应略好于去年，供销社系统可供化肥比去年同期增加约7％，大部分已送到农村，但由于价格高、资金短缺，农民实购化肥不足，应引起各地严重注意。
    化肥专营，使多头倒买倒卖等混乱现象基本上得到控制。根据历年情况，上半年所需化肥占全年用肥量的60％左右，供销社系统现已备肥5300万吨，约占此间需肥量的85％。当前突出的问题是，农民实际买到手的化肥不足。往年此时，农民一般已备20—30％春耕用肥，今年因缺资金，加上化肥价格仍高，影响农民购肥积极性。而化肥价格太高的主要原因是一些地方仍然没有执行国务院有关化肥价格的规定，省、地、县层层制定销售综合价，因而出现了一货多价等混乱现象，给非法倒卖创造了条件。据大连市调查，各种化肥比去年平均涨价45％。
