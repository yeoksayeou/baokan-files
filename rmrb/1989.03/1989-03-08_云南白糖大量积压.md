Currently, it is the peak season for sugar production. Many sugar mills in Yunnan have their warehouses overflowing, with white sugar piled up in offices and corridors. If the sugar is not quickly transported away, nearly 300,000 tons will have to be stored outdoors. Why is there an accumulation of sugar in the production areas despite the nationwide restriction on sugar supply in urban and rural areas? Provincial authorities attribute this to three main reasons: First, the import of sugar has been relatively smooth, easing the supply-demand contradiction, but some sugar mills have kept their self-sold sugar prices high, missing the opportunity to sell. Second, buyers lack funds, significantly reducing the amount of sugar stored in scattered locations. Third, there is a shortage of gasoline, leading to a substantial decrease in sugar transport vehicles.

　　云南白糖大量积压
    据新华社昆明３月７日电  （记者罗苹）目前正值榨糖旺季，云南不少糖厂的仓库已经暴满，堆放在办公室、走道里的白糖如不迅速运走，将有近３０万吨不得不露天放置。全国城乡普遍限量供应白糖，为何产地却大量积压？省有关部门回答说，原因有三个：一是进口糖到货情况较好，供求矛盾已趋缓和，而一些糖厂的自销糖价格仍居高不下，坐失了出售良机。二是买方资金短缺，分散储存的数量大为减少。三是汽油紧缺，运糖车辆大大减少。
