Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 17th.

Soldiers in the People's Liberation Army will start wearing new summer uniforms on May 1st. These uniforms are designed to adapt to international military fashion trends and will make the soldiers appear more spirited.

A responsible official from the relevant department told reporters today that this new summer uniform is intended for soldiers to wear during routine duties and formal occasions. The design has been significantly improved: the jacket now features an open collar instead of a buttoned collar, four pockets instead of two, and shoulder straps for rank insignia. The trousers have also been redesigned to replace the old, loose-fitting style. Female soldiers' summer uniforms are similar to those of female officers. Soldiers wearing these new uniforms will not wear ties but will pair them with standard-issue knitwear. The military caps are similar to the 85-style officer caps. Soldiers in these new uniforms will appear more spirited and vigorous.

Sergeants, professional sergeants, and military academy students will also switch to these new summer uniforms, which are similar in style to officers' summer uniforms.

The official stated that logistics departments in various units are currently working diligently to ensure that all soldiers receive their new uniforms by May, guaranteeing a proper fit for everyone.

　　我军士兵将着新夏装
    适应国际趋势　穿上更显精神
    新华社北京３月１７日电  （记者徐京跃）我军士兵今年５月１日起将解开风纪扣，换穿适应国际军服发展趋势的新式开领夏常服。
    有关部门负责人今天对记者说，这种新式夏常服供士兵在平时及一般礼仪场合着穿，式样有较大改进，上衣由关领式改为开领式，由两个口袋改为４个口袋，并增加佩带军衔标志的肩绊；军裤亦同时改变了过去的肥裤腿、大裤裆旧式样。女战士的夏常服式样与女军官的基本相同。士兵换着夏常服后，不系领带，配制式针织衫，军帽式样与８５式军官大檐帽基本相同。战士穿上这种新军装，更显得精神抖擞，英姿勃勃。
    军士长、专业军士、军队院校学员将同时换着新式夏常服，样式与军官夏常服基本相同。
    这位负责人说，目前各部队后勤部门正在紧张做好发放工作，以保证全军士兵在５月份开始穿上适体的新式军服。
