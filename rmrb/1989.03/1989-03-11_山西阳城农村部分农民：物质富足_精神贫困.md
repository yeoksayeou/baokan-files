Some farmers in the rural areas of Yangcheng County, Shanxi, although materially rich, are spiritually impoverished.

Superstition is rampant. In many villages, the belief in gods and ghosts is very serious. Some people, when ill, do not seek medical treatment but instead go around seeking gods and spirits; some people, when giving birth, also invite geomancers and Taoist priests; some people invite geomancers to choose the location of their houses and graves. One farmer, after toiling to build six new rooms, had a family member fall ill from overwork, and a yellow cow died from neglect. The geomancer said that the orientation of the house was wrong. The farmer then sold the new house at a very low price, tears in his eyes.

Gambling is rampant. In many villages, during festivals or off-seasons, some people gamble all night. In one village, there were more than 10 gambling dens in a single night. Some people, after losing money, even resort to physical fights.

Gift-giving is prevalent. For almost every event such as weddings, funerals, college entrance, joining the army, finding a job, giving birth, a child's 100-day celebration, first birthday, building a new house, relocating, or contract signing, gifts are given. The amount of money for gifts is increasing. Especially for wedding dowries, there are various types of gifts such as visiting gifts, recognition gifts, engagement gifts, letter gifts, and wedding gifts, ranging from a few hundred yuan to over a thousand yuan. Some farmers with poor economic conditions have to borrow money to give gifts, otherwise, they cannot get married.

Overpopulation is serious. Nowadays, many farmers, after giving birth to a girl, want a boy; after giving birth to a boy, they still want a girl; after having two children, they still want a third. A couple who already have four girls still hope that the fifth child will be a boy. They consulted a fortune-teller, who said that the seventh child would be a boy. The couple discussed and decided: "Then we will have the seventh child!"

Sanitation is poor. Some farmers raise poultry and livestock, and the area in front of and behind their houses is full of pig manure and chicken droppings, making it difficult for people to walk. Some people dig latrines by the ditches and fields, and during rain, the excrement overflows, emitting a foul odor. In some places, dozens or even hundreds of households use the same pond to wash rice, vegetables, pig feeders, and diapers. Many farmers keep their large livestock in the same courtyard as their living quarters, mixing humans and animals. These unsanitary habits seriously pollute the environment and endanger personal health.

Regarding these various uncivilized phenomena, many grassroots officials in rural areas turn a blind eye and do nothing.

### 山西阳城农村部分农民：物质富足　精神贫困

　　山西阳城农村部分农民：
    物质富足　精神贫困
    我县地处太行山区，这些年，不少农民虽然在物质生活上富足了，可精神生活却极度贫困。
    迷信盛行。不少村庄信神信鬼的现象非常严重。有的人生病不求医，到处请神求仙；有的生儿育女也要请阴阳、道士；有的请风水先生看宅子、选坟地等。有一农户辛辛苦苦盖了６间新房，家中一男子劳累过度病倒了，喂养的一头黄牛也因照顾不周，死了，风水先生说什么这座房子修的朝向不对头。这家农民便含着眼泪用很低的价钱，把新房卖给了别人。
    赌博成灾。在不少乡村，每逢节日或农闲时间，有些人赌博通宵达旦。有个村在一个夜晚，就设有１０多处赌场。有的赌输了钱，还大打出手。
    送礼成风。大凡婚丧事、升学、当兵、招工、生儿育女、小孩百日、周岁、修新房、闹移居、搞承包都要送礼，送礼钱越来越多。特别是结婚彩礼，什么串门礼、认亲礼、订婚礼、传书礼、结婚礼，少则几百元，多则上千元。一些经济条件差的农户要贷款送礼，否则婚事难成。
    超生严重。现在，许多农民生了女孩，想要男孩，生了男孩，还想要女孩；生了二胎，还想要三胎，不达到目的不罢休。有对夫妇已生了４个女孩，还指望第５胎生个男孩。他俩求神问卦，算命人说到第７胎才是男孩。这对夫妇商量后说：那就生到第７个吧！
    卫生很差。有些农户禽畜放养，村里房前屋后尽是猪粪、鸡屎，令人难以插足。有的在沟边田头随便挖“茅坑”，一下雨，粪便外溢，臭气熏人，有些地方几十户、上百户人在一个池塘里淘米、洗菜，同时又洗猪食桶、洗尿布。不少农户的大牲畜都喂养在住人的院里，人畜混杂。这些不卫生的习俗严重地污染了环境，危害人身健康。
    对于这些种种不文明的现象，不少农村基层干部置若罔闻，听之任之。
