    A coup attempt in Afghanistan was thwarted, tribal elders advocate internal reconciliation

    ISLAMABAD, March 3 (Xinhua) — According to today's report from the Pakistani newspaper "Frontier Post," the Kabul regime foiled a coup involving over 500 high-ranking officials on February 13. The plotters were reportedly led by a vice president.

    The newspaper cited a news release from the Afghan News Media Center in Peshawar, stating that the second vice president, Gulbuddin, discovered the plot and reported it to Najibullah before the coup could be executed. Najibullah took emergency measures, and the coup was ultimately aborted.

    The report also mentioned that Najibullah has prepared emergency measures within the presidential palace, including the completion of a helicopter landing pad and a helicopter on standby 24/7. There are reports that the Kabul authorities have drafted plans to destroy the radio station, television station, communication center, airport, and 28 other military depots.

    According to a commander of the Islamic Party's Harakat faction of the Afghan resistance forces, the Soviet Union left 1,000 soldiers who speak Pashto from the Central Asian region of the Soviet Union to guard Najibullah's presidential palace. These soldiers wear Afghan military uniforms and maintain close ties with the Afghan secret police, controlling the intelligence system in Kabul.

    Another report from the same newspaper stated that some prominent Afghan tribal elders have called for an end to mutual killings among Afghans after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops. They advocate for a ceasefire using traditional methods. This method is called "Tig," where a white stone representing peace is placed between the conflicting parties, leading to a ceasefire and the start of dialogue. The dialogue is moderated by tribal elders, and both parties must adhere to the peace agreement reached.

　　阿富汗一起政变流产
    部落长老主张内部和解
    本报伊斯兰堡３月３日电  记者任毓骏报道：据巴基斯坦《边疆邮报》今日消息，喀布尔政权于２月１３日挫败了一起由５００余名高级官员参与的内部政变。据报道，策划者为一位副总统。
    这家报纸的消息来源是设在白沙瓦的阿富汗新闻媒介中心发布的新闻稿。据报道，喀布尔政权第二副总统古尔达德发觉了这起密谋并在政变者动手之前向纳吉布拉报告。纳吉布拉采取了紧急措施，这场政变终于流产。
    报道还说，纳吉布拉在总统府内的应急措施已就绪，一个直升机起降场已修建完毕，一架直升机全天候命。有消息说，喀布尔当局已制订了炸毁电台、电视台、通讯中心、机场和另外２８个军事仓库计划。
    另据阿抵抗力量伊斯兰党哈里斯派的一位游击队司令所说，苏军留下１０００名讲普什图语的来自苏联中亚地区的官兵担任纳吉布拉总统府的警卫，这些官兵身穿阿富汗军装，与阿富汗秘密警察保持密切联系，控制着喀布尔的情报系统。
    这家报纸的另一条消息说，一些著名的阿富汗部族长老呼吁，苏联完全撤军后，阿富汗人不应该继续互相残杀，双方应该放下武器使这个饱尝战祸的国家实现和平。他们主张用古老的传统方式实现停火。这种方式称之为“蒂格”，即在冲突双方之间置放代表和平的白色石头，双方实现停火，开始对话。对话由部落长老主持，双方都必须履行达成的和平协议。
