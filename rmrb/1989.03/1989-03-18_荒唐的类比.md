Title: Absurd Analogies

	Israel's Foreign Minister Arens recently compared some countries' suggestion that Israel should accept the "land for peace" proposal to the appeasement policy adopted by Britain and France towards Germany in the past. He implied that if Israel withdraws from the occupied territories, it would be repeating the event of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland being ceded to Germany. He claimed that Israel today should not repeat this historical mistake and can only "protect itself in the right way."

	Arens made an absurd analogy. Czechoslovakia was the victim of the British and French appeasement policy, while Hitler was the blatant aggressor, which is common historical knowledge. However, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have always been Palestinian territories, as clearly stated in the United Nations' 1947 partition resolution. It was only in 1967 that Israel forcibly occupied these areas. Now, as the foreign minister, Arens is attempting to distort history by portraying Israel as the victim instead of the aggressor. It's astonishing that he could come up with such an idea!

	Of course, if Israel truly "protects itself in the right way," there would be nothing to object to. The Palestinian people have long acknowledged Israel's right to exist. However, the Israeli authorities should follow the historical trend, completely abandon the foolish practice of occupying others' territories to "protect their own interests," and through dialogue and political means, accelerate the peace process in the Middle East.

### 荒唐的类比

　　荒唐的类比
    以色列外长阿伦斯最近把一些国家要以色列接受“以领土换和平”的建议，比喻为当年英、法对德国的“绥靖政策”，言下之意是，如果以色列从被占领土上撤走，就意味着当年捷克斯洛伐克苏台德地区被割让给德国的事件的重演。他声称，今天的以色列不应该再蹈这段历史的覆辙，只能“以正确的方式保护自己”。
    阿伦斯作了个荒唐的类比。当年的捷克斯洛伐克是英法“绥靖政策”的牺牲者，而希特勒则是明目张胆的侵略者，这是历史常识。而约旦河西岸和加沙地带则从来就是巴勒斯坦领土，这在联合国１９４７年的分治决议中也是写得明明白白的，只是在１９６７年被以色列强行霸占。现在，身为外长的阿伦斯竟然企图以曲解历史的手法，把以色列从侵略者改扮成受害者，真亏他想得出！
    当然，以色列若果真“以正确的方式保护自己”自然无可厚非，巴勒斯坦人民早就承认以色列的合法存在权利。但以色列当局应该顺乎历史潮流，彻底抛掉以霸占别人领土来“维护自己利益”的愚蠢作法，通过对话和政治解决的途径，以加速中东和平进程。
