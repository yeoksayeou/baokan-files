People's Daily, Tokyo, March 30th.

Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru today delivered a speech in the Diet aimed at improving Japan-North Korea relations. He stated that the Japanese government expresses deep remorse and regret to all people on the Korean Peninsula. This is the first time the Japanese government has publicly expressed remorse for its past colonial policies to the North Korean side (similar views have been expressed to South Korea in the past).

Takeshita used the full name "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" for the first time in his speech (previously referred to as North Korea), indicating a new understanding to improve Japan-North Korea relations, to realize direct dialogue between governments as soon as possible, and to hope for unconditional negotiations on outstanding issues between Japan and North Korea, acknowledging the fact that relations between the two sides have been distant so far.

　　竹下希望改善日朝关系        
    对侵朝历史表示深刻反省
    本报东京３月３０日电  记者于青报道：日本首相竹下登今天在国会发表旨在改善日本和朝鲜关系的新见解中说，日本政府向朝鲜半岛所有的人表明深刻的反省和遗憾之意。这是日本政府第一次在公开场合，对过去的殖民地政策，正式向朝鲜方面表示反省（过去曾向南朝鲜方面表示过类似见解）。
    竹下在讲话中首次使用“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国”的全称（过去称北朝鲜），表示要基于新的认识改善日朝关系，尽早实现政府间直接对话，希望就日朝间悬案进行无前提条件协商，承认迄今双方关系疏远的事实。
