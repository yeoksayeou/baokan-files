The Shanxi provincial government recently decided to allocate special funds to establish a "Puppet Shadow Play Art Research Room" in Houma City. This is the first specialized research institution for puppet shadow plays in our country.

Puppet shadow plays are a unique form of Chinese folk art. The ancient art of puppet shadow plays was once widespread in cities and countryside, with a glorious history. The Western cultural community regards it as the precursor to theater and the first film in human history. It embodies the rich cultural heritage of the Chinese nation. The establishment of this puppet shadow play research room, advocated for many years by renowned puppet shadow play expert Lian Zhenhua, fills a long-standing gap in our country's cultural and folklore research.

    山西成立皮影研究室填补文化研究空白
    山西省政府最近决定拨专款在侯马市建立“皮影艺术研究室”。这是我国的第一个皮影戏专门研究机构。
    皮影是我国独有的民间艺术。古老的皮影戏过去曾遍及城乡，有过灿烂的历史；西方文化界称之为戏剧的前身，人类史上的第一部电影。它积淀着中华民族文化的丰富内容。经著名皮影戏专家廉振华多年呼吁而建立起的这个皮影研究室，填补了长期以来我国文化、民俗学研究上的一个空白。
