　　比一比　谁的产品好
    李璐
    埃森是联邦德国中西部鲁尔区的工业中心。在斯泰累大街上，有一座驰名全欧的埃森优良工业产品造型陈列馆。它的宗旨是为产品的不断“优生”，淘汰劣质产品、推陈出新服务。
    这里展出的工业产品，从日常生活用品到工业品样样俱全。全国的工厂、公司、企业都竭力争取委托该馆展出自己的产品，并以展出的品种繁多为荣。展品不索取报酬，但须经过专家组成的审查委员会评定，确认为优质产品才能获准展出。
    陈列馆以其独特的魅力吸引着世界各地的观众。馆内专门设有服务人员，向观众解释各种产品情况，同时直接听取消费者的意见，整理成文，送交新产品的设计者和生产单位，以便改进。这个展览馆不仅为新产品的宣传与推销起了积极作用，而且产品直接受到广大消费者的评比与监督，有利于改进产品质量。
