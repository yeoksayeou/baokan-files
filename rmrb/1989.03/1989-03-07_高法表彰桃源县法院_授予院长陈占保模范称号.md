Today, at a commendation meeting held in Changsha, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court Zhu Mingshan announced the conferral of the honorary title of "National Court Model" to Chen Zhanbao, Director of Taoyuan County People's Court. The Taoyuan County People's Court was awarded a collective first-class merit citation.

Chen Zhanbao, Director of Taoyuan County People's Court, has been diligent and responsible in his duties for decades, enforcing the law strictly and maintaining high case quality standards. Since 1984, he has resisted 88 instances of intervention, refused 16 invitations to dine with litigants, and declined 3,287 yuan in cash and gifts. Once, a cousin of his was involved in a brawl and injured someone. The local police, considering their relationship, did not take action. Upon hearing this, Chen immediately contacted the police station, insisting on handling the matter according to the law. Later, the person was administratively detained for 15 days by the public security bureau and fined 558 yuan for medical expenses.

The Taoyuan County People's Court has steadfastly served the reform, opening up, and development of the rural commodity economy, strictly enforcing the law and managing the court strictly. All aspects of their work have achieved remarkable results.
