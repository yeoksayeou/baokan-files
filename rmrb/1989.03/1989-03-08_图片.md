The image shows a tea packaging machine provided by the Danish B&L Trading House to the market. This packaging machine can package 1200 tea bags per minute. The material for the packaging bags is made of water-soluble filter paper. The tea packaging process is fully automated. The paper boxes are self-locking and do not require adhesive, thus avoiding any impact on the tea's aroma. Since the tea bags are placed overlapping inside the paper box, each box can hold 25 tea bags.

    图为丹麦宝隆洋行向市场提供的一种茶叶包装机。这种包装机每分钟可包装1200个茶叶包。包装袋的材料是采用可泡水的过滤纸。茶叶包装盒过程是全自动化的。纸盒为自锁型，不需用胶粘合，以免影响茶叶香味。由于纸盒内茶叶包重叠放置，每个纸盒可装25包茶叶。
