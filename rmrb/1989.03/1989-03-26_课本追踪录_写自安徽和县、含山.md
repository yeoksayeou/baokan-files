	Tracking Textbooks
		—From Anhui's He County and Han Shan County
		By Zhang Zhen Guo, Reporter for This Paper

	After the news titled “Anhui’s Middle and Primary School Textbooks Are Substandard, Late, and Excessive” was published on the second page of this paper on March 11, there were varying opinions: some said it was true, others said it might not be, and a few even challenged those who reported the facts. What is the actual situation? Here are a few incidents the reporter encountered recently:

	On March 17, the reporter happened to encounter a truck loaded with books. Upon asking, the driver said, “I am from the Xuchang Region’s Xinhua Bookstore. The school has been in session for many days, but the students still haven’t received all the main textbooks…” I boarded the truck and saw that it was delivering “Senior High Geography” textbooks to He County and Han Shan County.

	I followed the truck to the Xinhua Bookstore in He County. The delivery truck was still parked at the door. The deputy manager, Wei Xingping, said, “Delivering textbooks before the start of classes so that every student has a copy”—this should be a matter of course, but this year it couldn’t be done. Even now, there are still two main subjects’ textbooks that haven’t reached the students. People are criticizing us for ‘misleading the youth,’ and we have no grounds to defend ourselves.”

	The textbook custodian, Yong Qiu Lan, brought me a large bundle of defective books: The elementary school “Language” textbook, Volume 6, “Kite Flying,” printed by the She County Printing Plant in Anhui, has four blank pages. The middle school “English” textbook, Volume 2, printed by the Anqing Color Printing Plant, has pages 56 and 57 stuck together and can’t be separated. The middle school “Algebra” textbook, Volume 2, printed by the Xuchang Region Printing Plant, has pages 97 to 100 torn and the paper color is uneven. The middle school “Language” textbook, Volume 4, printed by the Hefei Xinghua Printing Plant, is missing 22 pages…

	I then went to the Han Shan Normal School. When I asked about the textbooks, the director of education, Zhang Mengqi, became angry. He opened a room and pointed to a large pile of discarded books, saying, “These are self-study guides for ‘Algebra and Elementary Functions’ (Volume 1) published by the Anhui Education Publishing House, priced at 0.91 yuan per book. Because there is money to be made, they arrived early. However, the main textbooks have been delayed for two years and had to be discarded.”

	He became even more angry and told another story: “Because they ordered some ‘Natural Science Foundations’ (Volume 2) and political textbooks printed by the Education Publishing House, the former has been overdue for half a year and the latter for more than a year. The teachers had no choice but to ‘dig into their stomachs’ to compile lecture notes and make do with teaching.”

	Li, the director in charge of textbook printing at the Anhui Provincial Press and Publication Bureau, told me: “This autumn, the province needs 5,900 tons of paper for textbooks, but so far only 1,500 tons have been secured. Several large paper mills have not delivered a single sheet of textbook paper by this time. The goal of ‘delivering textbooks before classes start so that every student has a copy’ on September 5 will be a bigger question mark…”

### 课本追踪录——写自安徽和县、含山

　　课本追踪录
    ——写自安徽和县、含山
    本报记者  张振国
    《安徽中小学教材差、迟、滥》的消息３月１１日在本报二版登出之后，有说确实如此，有说未必如此，甚至有个别人刁难反映实情的同志。情况究竟如何？请看记者近日碰到的二三事：
    ３月１７日，记者偶然遇到一辆满载书本的汽车。上前一问，司机说：“我是巢湖地区新华书店的，学校已开学多日，学生还未拿齐主要课本……”我登车一看，是送往和县、含山两县的《高中地理》。
    追到和县新华书店。那辆运书的汽车还停在门口。副经理伋兴平说：“课前到书，人手一册”，这种天经地义的事，今年却做不到。直到今日，还有两门主课的书本未到学生手里。人家骂我们“误人子弟”，我们有什么理由辩解呢？
    课本保管员雍秋兰抱了一大捆残书给我看：安徽歙县印刷厂印的小学《语文》第六册《放风筝》等文，有４面是白页。安庆彩色印刷厂印的初中《英语》第二册，５６和５７页粘在一起分不开。巢湖地区印刷厂印的初中《代数》第二册９７至１００页纸张碎裂、纸色不一。合肥杏花印刷厂印的初中《语文》第四册缺２２页……
    我又来到含山师范学校。一问起课本的事，教导主任张孟琪就生气。他打开一间屋，指着一大堆废书说，这是安徽教育出版社出版的《代数与初等函数》（上册）自学辅导资料，０．９１元１本。因有钱可赚，早就到书。可是，正本等了两年还未到，只好作废。
    他越说越生气，又给讲了件“挖肚子教书”的事：因他们订购一些教育出版社印制的《自然科学基础》（下册）和政治课本，前者已逾期半年未到，后者已逾期１年多未到。老师没办法，只好“挖肚子”编讲义，凑合着教。
    安徽省新闻出版局统管课本印刷的李处长告诉我：今秋，全省课本用纸需５９００吨，到目前才有１５００吨，好几家大纸厂时至今日一张课本纸未交。９月５日“课前到书，人手一册”，将是一个更大的问号……
