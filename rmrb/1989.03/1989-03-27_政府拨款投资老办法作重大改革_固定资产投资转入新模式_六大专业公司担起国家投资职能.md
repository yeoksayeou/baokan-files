In the past year, China has undertaken significant reforms in its investment management system, thereby changing the traditional government allocation investment system.

As a symbol of this reform: China established six specialized investment companies with legal person status last year, making them economic entities responsible for the State Council's development and operation of fixed asset investments.

Starting this year, the state's fixed asset investment plan and management have gradually begun to operate under the new model.

The National Energy Investment Company is responsible for investing in and developing coal, electricity, nuclear power, energy conservation, and petroleum industry projects.

The National Transportation Investment Company is responsible for investing in and developing railway, highway, waterway, and civil aviation projects.

The National Materials Investment Company is responsible for developing and operating steel, non-ferrous metals, petrochemical, chemical, building materials, non-metallic minerals, pharmaceuticals, and gold projects.

The National Machinery, Electronics, Light Industry, and Textiles Investment Company is responsible for investing in and developing machinery, electronics, shipbuilding, automotive, light industry, textiles, and tobacco projects.

The registered capital of the above four companies is RMB 800 million each (including USD 100 million in foreign currency).

The National Agricultural Investment Company is responsible for investing in and developing agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries, and feed industry projects.

The National Forestry Investment Company is responsible for investing in and developing forestry and forestry industry projects. The registered capital of these two companies is RMB 400 million each (including USD 20 million in foreign currency).

These six specialized companies not only have the functions of state-owned holding companies, ensuring the preservation and appreciation of funds, but also have the function of undertaking state policy-oriented investments, ensuring the completion of state plans.

　　政府拨款投资老办法作重大改革        
    固定资产投资转入新模式
    六大专业公司担起国家投资职能
    据中新社北京３月２５日电  （记者戴亚平）在过去的一年里，中国在投资管理体制方面进行了重大改革，从而改变了政府拨款的传统投资体制。
    作为这一改革的标志：中国于去年建立了能源、交通、原材料、机电轻纺、农业、林业六个具有法人地位的专业投资公司，使之成为国务院开发和经营固定资产投资的经济实体。
    自今年开始，国家固定资产投资计划和管理已逐步按新模式运行。
    国家能源投资公司负责投资开发和经营煤炭、电力、核电、节能和石油工业项目。
    国家交通投资公司负责投资开发和经营铁道、公路、水运、民航项目。
    国家原材料投资公司负责开发和经营钢铁、有色金属、石油化工、化工、建材、非金属矿、医药、黄金项目。
    国家机电轻纺投资公司负责投资开发和经营机械、电子、船舶、汽车、轻工、纺织、烟草项目。
    上述四个公司的注册资金额分别为人民币８亿元（其中外币１亿美元）。
    国家农业投资公司负责投资开发和经营农业、牧业、渔业和饲料工业项目。
    国家林业投资公司负责投资开发和经营林业、森林工业项目。这两个公司注册金额分别为人民币４亿元（其中外币２０００万美元）。
    这６家专业公司既具有国家控股公司的职能，使资金保值增值，又有承担国家政策性投资的职能，确保国家计划完成。
