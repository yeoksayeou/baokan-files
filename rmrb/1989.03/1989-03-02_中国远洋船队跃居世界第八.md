China's overseas shipping fleet has risen to the eighth position in the world. Currently, the overseas shipping companies own more than 600 vessels, including full container ships, roll-on/roll-off ships, oil tankers, refrigerated ships, and passenger ships, with a total deadweight of over 13 million tons. These vessels sail to more than 600 ports in over 150 countries and regions, making them a highly competitive large-scale transportation enterprise on the international stage.

In the 1960s, China's overseas shipping fleet had only a few dozen ships. The Bank of China utilized foreign exchange funds obtained from abroad to support the purchase of ships, changing the previous situation where overseas transportation mainly relied on chartered foreign ships. By the end of 1988, the Bank of China had cumulatively signed 6.5 billion U.S. dollars in loan contracts with the overseas shipping companies.

    中国远洋船队跃居世界第八
    本报北京3月1日讯　我国远洋商船队已跃居世界第8位。目前，远洋运输公司拥有全集装箱船、滚装船、油船、冷藏船和客船等600多艘，载重量达1300多万吨，航行于世界150多个国家和地区的600多个港口，成为在国际上具有相当竞争力的大型运输企业。
    60年代，我国远洋船队只有几十艘船，中国银行利用从境外吸收的外汇资金，支持其买船，改变过去远洋运输主要依靠租用外轮的局面。至1988年底，中国银行累计与远洋公司签订了65亿美元的贷款合同。
