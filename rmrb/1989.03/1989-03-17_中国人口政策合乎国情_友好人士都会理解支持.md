China's population policy is in line with national conditions, and friendly people will understand and support it.

    New China News Agency, Beijing, March 16 - Foreign Ministry spokesman Li Zhaoxing said today that China's implementation of family planning, control of rapid population growth, and improvement of population quality is not only beneficial to China's own development but also beneficial to the stability of the population and economic development in Asia and the world.

    At today's afternoon press conference, Li Zhaoxing made the above comments in response to reports about differing opinions within the U.S. Congress on China's population policy and the ensuing debate.

    He said that a country's population policy is a matter of that country's sovereignty. China's population policy is formulated based on its own national conditions.

    He expressed the belief that anyone who wishes for China's prosperity and for the continuous improvement of the living standards of the Chinese people will understand and support China's family planning policy.

　　中国人口政策合乎国情  友好人士都会理解支持
    新华社北京３月１６日电  外交部发言人李肇星今天在这里说，中国实行计划生育、控制人口过快增长、提高人口素质，不仅有利于中国的自身发展，而且有利于亚洲和世界人口的稳定和经济的发展。
    在今天下午的新闻发布会上，李肇星针对有关美国国会内对中国人口政策持两种意见并就此展开争论的报道，作了上述评论。
    他说，一个国家的人口政策是这个国家的主权。中国的人口政策是根据自己的国情制订的。
    他表示相信，任何希望中国繁荣、希望中国人民生活水平不断提高的人都会理解和支持中国的计划生育政策。
