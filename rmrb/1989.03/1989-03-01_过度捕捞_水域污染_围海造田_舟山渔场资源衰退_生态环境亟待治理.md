Overfishing, water pollution, and reclamation are causing the decline of Zhoushan fishery resources, which urgently need ecological restoration.

Zhoushan is an important commercial fish base in China, and the issues surrounding its marine industry and fishery resources are of great concern to people.

Numerous facts indicate that Zhoushan fishery resources are currently in decline. Before the 1970s, large and small yellow croakers, horse mackerel, and flounder were the pillars of Zhoushan's fishery industry, known as the "four major economic fish species." They typically accounted for about two-thirds of the total catch. However, by 1986, this had dropped to just over one-third. Large and small yellow croakers and flounder no longer form significant fishing seasons, with their catches being minimal. In 1988, horse mackerel resources hit their lowest point since the 1970s, with a 39.6% decrease in the first half of the year compared to the same period the previous year, and an 8% decrease during the winter fishing season. Now, marine fishery resources have shifted towards low-value and offshore fish species. In Zhoushan, the fish species with catches exceeding 10,000 tons, apart from horse mackerel, include mackerel, yellow croaker, horsehead, and shrimp, which are collectively referred to as the "new four major fish species" by the locals. In recent years, Zhoushan's fishery production has been able to maintain its original level mainly by developing and utilizing these "new four major fish species." However, since 1987, these "new four major fish species" have also shown signs of decline.

The decline of Zhoushan fishery resources is due to multiple factors, but the main ones are: overfishing that exceeds the reproductive capacity of fishery resources; increasing marine pollution that severely harms fishery resources; and unchecked reclamation that destroys fish spawning grounds.

Zhoushan fishery resources are a significant national asset. In recent years, Zhoushan has adjusted its operations and strengthened marine environmental monitoring, achieving remarkable results. From 1984 to 1987, Zhoushan's marine fishery production and income increased, with total output and total value surpassing historical highs. People metaphorically describe Zhoushan's fishery industry as having taken a "V-shaped" turn, emerging from the trough. Faced with these facts, many people praise, saying, "This is the benefit of paying attention to marine ecological balance and marine environmental protection."

Therefore, the author appeals to all parties to take concrete measures to comprehensively restore the marine ecological environment. In this way, Zhoushan fishery can still achieve significant results.

### 过度捕捞　水域污染　围海造田  舟山渔场资源衰退　生态环境亟待治理

　　过度捕捞　水域污染　围海造田
    舟山渔场资源衰退　生态环境亟待治理
    舟山是我国的重要的商品鱼基地，舟山的海洋业和舟山渔场的水产资源问题尤为人们所关注。
    大量事实表明，目前舟山渔场水产资源正在衰退。７０年代之前，近海的大小黄鱼、带鱼、比目鱼，是舟山渔业的支柱，号称“四大经济鱼类”。一般年份占到总产量的２／３左右，而１９８６年已降到１／３多一点，其中大小黄鱼、比目鱼已形不成渔汛，产量寥寥无几。１９８８年带鱼资源降到了７０年代以来的最低点，上半年比上年同期减少３９．６％，冬汛比上年同期减少８％。现在，海洋水产资源已向低值鱼类和外洋性鱼类转化。舟山市渔获品种中，产量上万吨的鱼类除带鱼外，有鲭、黄鲇鱼、马面鱼和虾类等，群众称之为“新四大鱼类”。前几年舟山渔区水产品产量所以能基本保持原有水平，主要靠开发利用这“新四大鱼类”。但是，从１９８７年起，这“新四大鱼类”也出现衰退迹象。
    造成舟山渔场水产资源衰退的原因是多方面的，但主要的是：捕捞强度超过水产资源的增殖能力；渔场污染日趋严重，水产资源深受其害；无止境的围海造田，破坏了鱼类的产卵场。
    舟山渔场水产资源是国家的重要财富。近几年来，舟山市调整作业，加强海洋环境检测，因而收到了事半功倍的效果。１９８４—１９８７这四年中，舟山海洋渔业增产、增收，总产量和总产值都超过了历史的最好水平。人们形象地比喻舟山渔业走了一个“Ｖ”字形的弯路，已从低谷里走了出来。在事实面前，许多人称赞说，这是注意了海洋生态平衡和海洋环境保护所得到的好处。
    为此，笔者呼吁各方面切实采取措施，对海洋生态环境进行认真的综合治理。这样舟山渔场仍然是可以有所作为的。浙江　张龙年
