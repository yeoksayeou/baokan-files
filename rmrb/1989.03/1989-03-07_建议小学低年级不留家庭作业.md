	The new semester has begun, and children are once again carrying heavy school bags to and from school. With this, the hearts of parents also feel heavy. Children start school at 7:30 AM, and the morning reading time from 7:30 to 8:00 AM has somehow become a formal class period. After school in the afternoon, there are still remedial classes, making their school hours as long as an adult's workday. After returning home, adults can relax and watch TV, but children are tied to their desks doing homework. The daily homework load for lower grades in primary school is generally more than two hours, and it multiplies several times during holidays and vacations. Teachers mean well, but the results are often the opposite.

	Firstly, children aged seven or eight have not yet fully developed their brains and bodies, and they cannot endure long periods of writing at a desk. After school, they are not given time to play and jump around, which can harm their vision, physical strength, and energy. Secondly, without leisure time for extracurricular activities, children lose the opportunity to observe society, understand nature, and develop various interests, which is akin to stifling their intelligence. Some children have already started learning music, painting, and foreign languages in their preschool years, but once they start school, it becomes very difficult to continue. Is it too cruel to make children tearfully resist the allure of "Little Dot" and "Seven Boards"? Thirdly, the number of students in lower-grade classes is large, often fifty or sixty per class, making it difficult for teachers to provide individual guidance. After school, parents want to guide their children in a targeted manner, but because the homework is general and lacks specificity, they end up not being able to do so. After completing the homework, it's time to go to bed, and parents do not want to take away their children's sleep time. Some parents know that their children's handwriting is poor, but to rush through the homework, they do not dare to take the time to correct their children's handwriting, so they let them write in a "dragonfly" style.

	Therefore, I believe that homework for lower grades in primary school does more harm than good. I suggest that homework be completed within the two afternoon classes and not assigned as homework. The time after class should be left for children to play hopscotch, read fairy tales, watch "One Piece," play the violin, take a bath, or visit the park. Please, teachers, be kind and give children a colorful childhood. I bow on behalf of the children!

　　建议小学低年级不留家庭作业
    小青
    新学期开始，孩子们又背着沉甸甸的书包上下学了，随之家长的心也沉甸甸的。孩子们早晨７点半就到校，７点半到８点的晨读不知何时已成正式课时。下午放学之后还有辅导课，跟大人上班时间一样长。回家后大人还能看看电视松弛一下，可孩子们却要拴在书桌旁做家庭作业。小学低年级的日作业量一般都在两小时以上，逢节假日就不知翻几番了。老师用心良苦，效果却适得其反。
    其一，七八岁的孩子大脑、身体尚未发育成熟，承受不了长时间的伏案写字，放学了还不给他们玩耍、蹦跳的时间，会损害他们的视力、体力和精力。其二，无课外活动的余暇，把孩子们观察社会、了解自然、发展各种兴趣的机会都剥夺了，无异于扼杀孩子们的智慧。有些孩子在幼儿阶段学音乐、绘画、外语等已经上道，可一上学就很难坚持了。让孩子含着眼泪拒绝《小不点》、《七巧板》的诱惑，不是太残酷了吗？其三，现在小学低年级班级人数多，一班五六十人，老师很难个别指导。放学后，家长很想有针对性地辅导孩子，因为作业有普遍性，少针对性。可忙完作业就该上床了，家长实在不忍心再剥夺孩子的睡眠时间了。有的家长明知孩子字写得不好，可为了赶作业，不敢耽误时间矫正孩子的字体，只好由他“龙飞凤舞”去了。
    由此我认为，小学低年级家庭作业弊多利少，建议作业在下午的两节课之内完成，就不要留家庭作业了。课后的时间留给孩子们跳方格、读童话、看《一休》、拉提琴、洗海澡、逛公园吧，请老师高抬贵手，还给孩子们一个丰富多彩的童年，我代孩子们向老师鞠躬了！
