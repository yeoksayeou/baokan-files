    Love should not have boundaries. But soldiers have a unique profession, and during their short service period, their main focus is on military, political, and cultural training, and they must be ready for combat tasks at any time. "Love" cannot be as unrestrained as it is for civilians. Therefore, the General Political Department explicitly stipulates that "soldiers are not allowed to have romantic relationships with local young women during their service. Upon demobilization, they are not allowed to take local young women with them."

    However, in recent years, the boundaries of love have been quietly crossed, and local girls' love affairs have troubled the military camps. Soldiers are also seeking "a lifelong partner" among local young women. It is understood that in a certain division, about 9% of soldiers in units with frequent contact with the local population have established romantic relationships with local young women, while in remote mountain units with less contact, the figure is around 4%.

    Having romantic relationships with local young women affects military-civilian relations. In a certain island, there are few young women, and local young men have difficulty finding partners. The island's military leadership has stipulated that even officers are not allowed to have romantic relationships on the island. However, upon demobilization, a platoon leader took a talented and beautiful "August 1st" female militia platoon leader from the island, causing a very bad impression locally. During a military training session at a local high school, a soldier fell in love with a female high school student, who then lost interest in her studies and her grades plummeted. Later, her parents tried to persuade her to break off the relationship with the soldier, but she refused. In a fit of anger, she took several hundred yuan from home and ran away. Her family caused a stir at the military unit. An old soldier in a certain unit had a two-year relationship with a local rural girl. Later, due to family opposition, the girl demanded a breakup. In despair, the old soldier struck the girl's head with a grenade, leading him to a life of crime.

    Having romantic relationships with local young women also directly affects military construction. A supply soldier in a certain unit fell in love with a local young woman. The young woman demanded that he deliver goods to her family when purchasing supplies for the unit. To please the young woman, the soldier delivered fresh chickens, ducks, fish, and vegetables to her family for free for several years, becoming an unofficial "son-in-law." Soldiers' monthly allowances are only twenty or thirty yuan, and some spend over a hundred yuan on a single outfit to satisfy the young woman's desires. Dining out with the young woman is also common. Some soldiers, lacking financial means, turn to their parents, causing a burden on their families. To meet with local young women, soldiers often go out privately, stay out all night, and violate discipline. Some even use their duties to secretly meet with their partners. Some are so engrossed in "romance" that they neglect their work, studies, and training. Due to the fear of being discovered in the local area, secret lovers are often in a state of tension, leading to accidents during the execution of duties.

    Many soldiers have romantic relationships with local young women, but very few actually get married. This is because the relationship between men and women is often impulsive and arbitrary, with a weak emotional foundation. Uninformed meetings, brief encounters, distant families, cultural differences, and significant economic disparities result in a marriage rate of only about 8%, while the divorce rate is over 60%. According to a survey by a certain division over five years, a soldier from an urban communication unit took a local rural girl with him upon demobilization. He spent over a thousand yuan on gifts to help her find a job and register her residence in the city, but his efforts were in vain. His elderly parents also looked down on the village girl, and they eventually parted in pain.

    In recent years, the reasons for love crossing the "military line" in large quantities are as follows: First, soldiers have more contact with local young women through military-civilian cooperation, student military training, military-civilian celebrations, and training in civilian homes, leading to emotional attachments. However, military education is insufficient, and measures are ineffective, ultimately resulting in "love fruits." Second, soldiers' service ages are mostly between 18 and 25, the prime of their youth. Due to the influence of bad books, magazines, and the early dating trend in society, they seek early contact with the opposite sex. Third, soldiers from families with financial difficulties and those with poor personal conditions find it hard to find partners at home and want to use their military status to find a partner. Fourth, local residents want to find wealthy individuals, encouraging their daughters to throw "love knots" at military technicians. Fifth, some girls have a bad reputation locally, making it difficult for them to get married, so they try every means to find an unsuspecting local soldier to marry. A local girl in a certain regiment became pregnant and claimed that the child was a certain soldier's, demanding to marry him. However, the soldier had only met her three times and had already demobilized and returned home a year and a half earlier. According to a survey by a certain regiment, over 40% of local girls who have relationships with soldiers have problematic lifestyles.

    The spread of "local love" in military camps is not an incurable disease. The Beijing Military Region's certain regiment has adopted eight comprehensive measures, including educating soldiers about military policies and regulations, educating them about local love tragedies, family assistance education, strengthening administrative management, enriching the unit's cultural life, and helping elderly, disabled, and financially struggling soldiers find partners through local women's federations. The results have been remarkable. In the past two years, due to effective education and measures, the number of soldiers having romantic relationships with local young women has decreased from 6% to 0.1%.

### 爱情越过“军事线”  是放任不管，还是精心疏导？

　　爱情越过“军事线”
    是放任不管，还是精心疏导？
    陈辉
    “男大当婚，女大当嫁”。爱情不应有禁区。但士兵有其特殊的职业，在短暂的服役期中，他们的主要精力用于学军事、政治、文化，并随时准备担负战斗任务，“爱情”不能像常人那样没有“界线”，随心所欲。为此，总政治部明文规定“战士在服役期间，不准在驻地与地方女青年谈恋爱。退伍时，不准将驻地女青年带走”。
    但是，近几年来爱情的“禁区”被悄悄地突破了，地方姑娘的爱情困扰着驻地军营。士兵们也在驻地女青年中寻求“百年之好”。据了解，某师在与地方接触多的部队中，约有９％的战士与驻地姑娘建立了恋爱关系，接触少的偏远山区部队也占４％左右。
    和驻地女青年谈恋爱，影响了军民关系。某海岛，女青年少，当地小伙子找对象困难，驻岛部队领导规定，干部也不准在岛上谈恋爱。然而，一名班长复员时，却把岛上一名才貌出群的“三八”女子民兵班长带走，在当地造成很坏的影响。某团在地方一所中学军训时，一名战士和女高中生谈上恋爱，该生无心学习，成绩直线下降。后来，父母苦口劝其与那位战士断绝关系，该女不从，一气之下，从家中拿了几百元钱，离家出走，女方全家到部队闹得满城风雨。某部队一名老战士与驻地一农村姑娘相爱两年，后来女方迫于家庭反对，要求分手。这名老兵在绝望中，竟用手榴弹狠击女方头部，走上了犯罪道路。
    和驻地女青年谈恋爱，也直接影响了部队建设。某部一名连队给养员和驻地姑娘谈上了恋爱，姑娘要求他给连队采购时，要为她家送货上门。为讨姑娘欢心，这名战士连续几年把为连队采购的鸡鸭鱼肉，新鲜蔬菜，免费奉送，成了未上门的“特供女婿”。战士津贴费每月仅有二、三十元，有的为满足姑娘的奢望，一套衣服就花去上百元，陪姑娘下馆子也是常事。有的战士财力不足，便向父母伸手，给家中造成负担。为了和驻地姑娘约会，私自外出，夜不归宿，违反纪律的现象也时有发生，有的还利用执勤时偷着和女方约会。有的整日陷入“罗漫谛克”之中，无心工作、学习、训练。由于在当地搞对象怕人发现，偷恋者精神长期处于紧张状态，执行公务时，神不守舍，由此酿成的事故也不少。
    和驻地女青年谈恋爱的多，但真正成婚的却很少。这是因为，男女双方这种关系盲目性大，随意性强，感情基础不牢。不摸底细的相识，短暂的会面，家庭相距的遥远，风俗习惯的差异，经济条件的悬殊，使成婚率仅在８％左右，而离婚率又高达６０％多。据某师５年来的调查，某部通信连战士系城市兵，复员时把驻地农村姑娘带走成婚，为女方在市里找工作、上户口，花了上千元送礼，仍未能如愿。家中老人又对这位村姑冷眼相看，最后只好痛苦地分手。
    近几年来，爱情大量越过“军事线”的原因：一是部队战士通过军民共建、学生军训、军民联欢、民房驻训和驻地女青年接触多了，双方产生了感情，但部队教育不够，措施不力，终酿成“爱果”。二是战士服役年龄大都在１８—２５岁，正是青春旺季，由于受不良书画、刊物刺激和社会上早恋风的影响，渴求过早接触异性。三是家庭困难，本人条件差的战士回家找对象不易，想借穿军装的优势，找个对象。四是当地群众想找致富能人，纷纷让自己的姑娘向部队技术兵投“绣球”。五是有些姑娘在当地有劣迹，出嫁困难，便千方百计找不知底细的驻地战士攀亲。某团一位驻地姑娘怀了孕，来部队说孩子是某战士的，要求和那位战士结婚。而这名战士仅和她见过三次面，早在一年半前就复员回家乡了。据某团调查，和战士搞对象的驻地姑娘有４０％多的生活作风有问题。
    驻地“爱情”在军营泛滥，也并非不治之症。北京军区某团在战士中采取部队有关政策、规定教育，驻地爱情悲剧教育，家庭协助教育，以及加强行政管理，丰富连队业余文化生活，通过地方妇联为大龄、伤残和家庭困难的战士找对象等８种方式，进行综合治理，收效甚佳。近两年来，由于教育有方，措施得力，战士与驻地女青年的恋爱人数由６％下降到０．１％。
