Non-local residents stranded in Lhasa must re-register

    Lhasa, March 20 (Reported by Lu Xiaofei) The Tibet Autonomous Region People's Government has decided to re-register non-local residents stranded in Lhasa starting from March 21. Those who contribute to the local economy, culture, and technology will be handled leniently, while those who are unrelated to local construction will be strictly examined. A small number of non-local residents who seriously disrupt local production and living order will be cleared out. This is another extraordinary measure taken by the autonomous region government since the imposition of martial law in Lhasa.

    Duoji Cairang revealed that in recent years, the floating population in Lhasa has surged, with tens of thousands of long-term residents. During major festivals or religious activities, the floating population can reach 70,000 to 80,000. Although most of these people have gone through legal procedures and have played a positive role in local economic construction and social services, Lhasa, with a population of only about 100,000, still feels the pressure. Among the stranded residents, there are some who have entered blindly without proper occupations. According to investigations, a small number of them have participated in riots or looting, and some have engaged in other criminal activities.

　　外地滞留拉萨人员        
    必须重新申报登记
    本报拉萨３月２０日电  记者卢小飞报道：西藏自治区人民政府决定从３月２１日起，对滞留拉萨的外来人口重新进行申报登记。对有利于促进地方经济、文化、科技发展的外来留居人员将从宽掌握，对那些与地方建设无关的外来滞留人员将从严审查，少数严重影响当地生产、生活秩序的外来滞留人员将受到清理。这是拉萨实行戒严以来自治区人民政府采取的又一非常措施。
    多吉才让透露，近年来，拉萨市流动人口激增，长年滞留者有三四万人，遇有重大节日或宗教活动，流动人口多达七八万人。虽然其中多数人办理了合法手续，并对当地经济建设和社会服务发挥了良好作用，但只有十几万人口的拉萨市仍然感到压力很大。滞留人员中有一部分盲目流入的无正当职业，据查有少数人参与了骚乱或打、砸、抢，有的人有其它刑事犯罪活动。
