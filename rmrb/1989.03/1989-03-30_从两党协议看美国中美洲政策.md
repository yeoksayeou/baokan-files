On March 24, President Bush signed a bipartisan agreement on Central American issues with congressional leaders, outlining the key points of U.S. policy towards Central America. The agreement has been welcomed by domestic public opinion, which views it as a major diplomatic move by the Bush administration, indicating a clear shift in U.S. policy towards Central America.

The bipartisan agreement was finalized after several weeks of negotiations between Secretary of State Baker and leaders from both parties in Congress. Its main points can be summarized as follows: Firstly, the U.S. has taken a more proactive stance towards peace in Central America. The U.S. has explicitly expressed its support for the peace and democratization process in Central America, endorsing the goals set by the Esquipulas Peace Agreement (signed by the heads of state of five Central American countries in August 1987) and is willing to work with Latin American countries to achieve these goals. Secondly, the U.S. has adjusted its policy towards Nicaragua. President Bush stated that the U.S. does not seek to dictate Nicaragua's political direction; this is a matter for the Nicaraguan people to decide. The U.S. policy aims to promote Nicaragua's democratization process, urging Nicaragua to honor its commitments to achieve democracy and elections. Regarding the anti-government forces in Nicaragua, the U.S. will continue to provide humanitarian aid, including food, housing, and medical supplies, at the current level until February next year when Nicaragua holds elections. However, the U.S. demands that these forces refrain from military actions and supports their voluntary return home. Thirdly, the U.S. has made demands of the Soviet Union, asserting that the Soviet Union has no legitimate security interests in Central America and should cease all aid that does not align with the peace process in Central America. Generally, the most notable feature of the bipartisan agreement is that the U.S. has shifted its focus from the military means favored during the Reagan era to diplomatic efforts, seeking "democracy, peace, and security" in Central America.

The Bush administration's adjustment of U.S. policy towards Central America through the bipartisan agreement is a timely move. It is seen as a response to both domestic and international developments. Over the past few years, the situation in Central America has undergone significant changes. Latin American and Central American countries have, through their own efforts, proposed plans for the peace process in Central America, with a trend towards ceasefires and dialogue among relevant countries. In February, Central American countries reached a specific agreement for achieving domestic peace in Nicaragua. Concurrently, the Nicaraguan government has also adjusted its policies in a timely manner for the peace and future of Central America. These developments undoubtedly pose a challenge to U.S. diplomacy. Additionally, after years of policy debates, the U.S. government has recognized that its past Central American policies lacked domestic and international support and were a failure, necessitating change. The bipartisan agreement was formed against this backdrop.

However, the bipartisan agreement is just the beginning of U.S. policy towards Central America. U.S. newspapers have noted that it is a statement of principles, not an action plan. On March 24, President Bush stated that he hopes to see a democratic Central America where all countries can coexist peacefully. In the coming days, people will be watching to see what concrete actions the U.S. will take to promote the peace process in Central America.

### 从两党协议看美国中美洲政策

　　从两党协议看美国中美洲政策
    本报记者  张启昕
    布什总统３月２４日同国会领袖签署了一项有关中美洲问题的两党协议，提出了美国中美洲政策的要点，受到国内舆论的欢迎，认为这是布什政府采取的一个重大外交政策行动，表明美国的中美洲政策发生了明显变化。
    两党协议是贝克国务卿同国会两党领袖经过几周协商后确定的，就其主要内容而言，可以看出这样几个方面：首先，美国对中美洲和平采取了更为积极的态度。美国明确表示支持中美洲的和平与民主化进程，支持埃斯基普拉斯协议（即１９８７年８月中美洲５国首脑签署的中美洲和平协议）所确定的目标，并愿与拉美国家一起为其实现而努力。其次，美国对尼加拉瓜的政策作了新的调整。布什总统表示，美国并不要求对尼加拉瓜政治发号施令，这是由尼加拉瓜人民自己决定的。美国的政策是促进尼加拉瓜的民主化进程，要求尼加拉瓜遵守自己的诺言，实现民主与选举。对于尼加拉瓜反政府力量，美国将继续提供目前水平的包括食品、住房和医药等人道主义援助，直到明年２月尼加拉瓜举行选举，但美国要求尼加拉瓜反政府力量不采取军事行动，并支持他们自愿返回家园。其三，美国对苏联提出了要求，认为苏联在中美洲并无合法的安全利益，应该停止一切不符合中美洲和平进程的援助。一般认为，两党协议最显明的特点是美国已把政策的重点从里根时代所倚重的军事手段转向运用外交努力，寻求中美洲的“民主、和平与安全”。
    布什政府通过两党协议调整了美国的中美洲政策不失为适合时宜的一步。人们认为，这是由国内外形势决定的。几年来，中美洲形势已发生巨大变化，拉美国家和中美洲国家通过自己的努力，已为中美洲的和平进程提出了规划，出现了有关国家实行停火、对话的趋势，今年２月，中美洲国家又为尼加拉瓜实现国内和平达成了具体协议。与此同时，尼加拉瓜政府为中美洲和平和本国的前途也适时调整了政策。这些无疑对美国的外交是种考验。其次，美国政府经过多年的政策争论，也认识到过去的中美洲政策得不到国内外的支持，是个失败，必须改变，两党协议正是在这种背景下，逐步酝酿形成的。
    然而，两党协议仅仅是美国中美洲政策的开篇。美国报纸认为，它是原则的声明，还不是行动计划。布什总统２４日称，他希望看到一个民主的中美洲，在那里的所有国家能够和平相处。在今后的时日里，美国拿出什么实际行动来促进中美洲的和平进程将是人们所关注的。
