Ignoring the ruling party's decision, Botha insists on remaining South African president

	New York, March 16 – South African President Botha, who had been resting for eight weeks due to a mild stroke, resumed work on the 15th.

	On the morning of the 15th, Botha first met with cabinet members in his office in Cape Town, and then went to the parliament to listen to the finance minister's presentation of the 1989-1990 fiscal budget report.

	The 73-year-old Botha was hospitalized on January 18 for treatment of a mild stroke. On January 19, the Minister of Constitutional Development and Planning, Horn, was sworn in as acting president. On February 2, Botha resigned from his position as chairman of the ruling National Party due to health reasons. His position was taken over by the Minister of Education and the leader of the National Party in the Transvaal Province, 52-year-old de Klerk.

	During Botha's absence, there was intense competition within the ruling party over who would become the next president. The National Party's decision-making committee met late on the 13th and decided that the party's new leader, de Klerk, would become the state president. However, Botha stated that according to the constitution, his term does not expire until March 1990. He ignored the party's decision and claimed that he might still run for the next presidency.

　　置执政党的决定于不顾
    博塔坚持留任南非总统
    新华社北京三月十六日电  开普敦消息：南非总统博塔因轻度中风休息了八周以后，十五日恢复工作。
    博塔十五日早晨首先在开普敦的办公室会见了内阁成员，然后前往议会听取财政部长向议会提交的一九八九—一九九○年度财政预算报告。
    七十三岁的博塔一月十八日因轻度中风住院治疗。一月十九日立宪发展和计划部长霍尼斯宣誓就任代理总统。二月二日博塔因健康原因辞去了执政的国民党主席的职务。他的职务由教育部长、国民党德兰士瓦省领导人五十二岁的德克勒克接任。
    在博塔离职期间，南非执政党内围绕今后究竟谁当总统的问题展开了激烈竞争。国民党的决策委员会十三日深夜开会决定，该党新领导人德克勒克将任国家总统。但博塔说，根据宪法，他的任期到一九九○年三月才期满。他对党的决定置之不理，并声称他可能仍要竞选下届总统。
