Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th — (Reporter Ding Jianming) Entering February, China's urban and rural savings saw a good growth trend. According to data from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the Bank of China, the China Construction Bank, and the rural credit cooperatives, these four specialized banks and credit cooperatives collectively increased savings by 20.36 billion yuan in February, approximately 5 billion yuan more than the same period last year.

The specific amounts of savings increases for each bank in February are as follows: the Industrial and Commercial Bank increased by 8.45 billion yuan, the Agricultural Bank increased by 3.8 billion yuan, the rural credit cooperatives increased by 5.47 billion yuan, the Construction Bank increased by 1.63 billion yuan, and the Bank of China increased by 1.02 billion yuan. It is understood that urban and rural savings increasing by 20 billion yuan in one month is unprecedented since the founding of the country. As a result, the balance of urban and rural savings deposits in China has exceeded 40 billion yuan.

According to analysis, the main reasons for the significant increase in savings deposits in February are: since the beginning of the year, the market has been relatively stable, and the upward trend in prices has been somewhat controlled, leading to a stabilization of residents' psychological state; secondly, due to the rapid growth of consumption funds in January, banks increased personal wage expenditures by 61% compared to the same period last year, leaving residents with more cash on hand. Additionally, starting from February 1, banks again raised the interest rates for savings deposits.

It is worth noting that according to past patterns, February is generally the month with the highest increase in savings deposits each year. Therefore, relevant officials believe that the savings situation should not be taken lightly. Especially in the first two months, the proportion of urban savings deposits to wage cash expenditures is still lower than in previous years, and rural savings have not fundamentally improved. They believe that residents' psychological tolerance remains fragile. To maintain the momentum of savings growth, the key is for the state to take effective measures to stabilize prices and resolutely curb the arbitrary price hikes in various places.

### 市场相对稳定　银行调高利率  上月城乡储蓄增加二百多亿

　　市场相对稳定　银行调高利率
    上月城乡储蓄增加二百多亿
    据新华社北京３月１０日电  （记者丁坚铭）进入２月份，我国城乡储蓄出现了较好的增长势头。据中国工商银行、中国农业银行、中国银行和中国人民建设银行及信用社提供的情况，２月份，这４家专业银行和信用社共增加储蓄２０３．６亿元，约比去年同期多增加５０亿元。
    ２月份各家银行储蓄增加的具体数额是：工商银行增加８４．５亿元，农业银行增加３８亿元，农村信用社增加５４．７亿元，建设银行增加１６．３亿元，中国银行增加１０．２亿元。据了解，城乡储蓄一个月增加２００亿元，这在建国以来还属首次。至此，我国城乡储蓄存款余额超过４０００亿元。
    据分析，２月份储蓄存款大量增加的主要原因是，年初以来市场相对稳定，物价上涨的势头有所控制，居民心理趋于平稳；其次，由于元月消费基金增长迅猛，银行对个人的工资性支出比去年同期增加了６１％，居民手持现金较多，再加上从２月１日起，银行又一次调高了储蓄存款利率。
    值得一提的是，按照以往规律，每年２月份一般都是储蓄存款增加最多的月份。因此有关人士认为，对储蓄形势决不能掉以轻心。特别是前两个月城镇储蓄存款增加额占工资性现金支出的比重仍然低于前几年水平，而且农村储蓄至今未有根本性好转。他们认为，目前居民的心理承受能力仍很脆弱，要继续保持储蓄增长势头，关键是国家要采取有效措施稳定物价，坚决刹住各地的随意乱涨价风。
