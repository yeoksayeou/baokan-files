Nepalese Foreign Minister Upadhyaya today emphasized that "transit is a right that a landlocked country should enjoy," and that how many transit points India can provide for Nepal should be resolved through bilateral consultations.

Recently, India, citing the expiration of the Nepal-India trade agreement and transit agreement without the signing of new ones, closed most of the transit points on its border that had previously been provided to Nepal, cutting off most of Nepal's trade routes with the outside world, and announced the suspension of the supply of petroleum products and some goods to Nepal.

Upadhyaya went to New Delhi on the 26th to hold talks with Indian Foreign Minister Rao, but the talks were unsuccessful.

He said that currently, Nepal's goods can only enter through two transit points, affecting people's lives, "in fact, difficulties have already arisen."

　　尼泊尔外交大臣强调        
    内陆国享有过境权
    新华社加德满都３月２７日电  尼泊尔外交大臣乌帕德亚亚今天强调说，“过境是一个内陆国应享有的权利”，而印度能给尼泊尔提供多少过境点则应是双边协商解决的问题。
    最近，印度以尼印贸易条约和过境条约期满而两国未能签新约为由，关闭了其边界过去为尼泊尔提供的大多数过境点，切断了尼泊尔与外界大部分贸易往来线路，并宣布停止向尼泊尔提供石油产品、部分商品等。
    乌帕德亚亚于２６日前往新德里同印度外长拉奥会谈，但未获成功。
    他说，目前尼泊尔的商品只能通过两个过境点进入尼泊尔，人民生活受到了影响，“事实上已经出现困难”。
