On January 28, the Man Kam To port in Shenzhen, which had previously experienced traffic congestion causing complaints and dissatisfaction among Hong Kong drivers, saw improvements under the direction of the Shenzhen Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government. The customs, border control, public security, inspection, and ten other units collaborated to develop measures to address the issue. The congestion problem has now been resolved. Currently, one vehicle is processed every 10 seconds, and during peak times, up to 7,000 to 12,000 heavy-duty trucks pass through the border daily.

    繁忙的文锦渡
    1月28日，曾一度出现塞车现象引起香港司机的抱怨和不满的深圳文锦渡口岸，在深圳市委、市政府的指挥下，文锦渡海关、边防、公安、检验等十个单位经过协商，共同制订了改进措施，塞车现象已解决。现在，每10秒钟可放行一辆车，遇有高峰时，每天过关载重汽车达7000辆至12000辆。
