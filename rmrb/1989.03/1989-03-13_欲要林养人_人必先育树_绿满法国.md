France's forest area covers 14 million hectares, accounting for more than one-quarter of its total land area, making it one of the countries with the most forest land in the European Community.

Forests provide not only social benefits but also significant economic returns. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, forest products bring in 140 billion francs annually for France. Paris's forests attract more than 100 million domestic and international tourists each year. Maintaining ecological balance is also considered an important task in developing forestry. The pine forests in the southern region of Aquitaine, for example, help to stabilize sand dunes.

"To have forests nourish people, people must first nurture trees," says Monsieur Monot, a technical consultant for the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. France has been systematically developing its forestry industry in the decades since the war. Each year, approximately 50,000 hectares of new forest are planted, increasing the area of man-made forests by more than 2 million hectares and creating 15,000 kilometers of forest belts along roads. The newly added forest land is mostly barren hills and wild areas, thereby continuously expanding the country's green spaces.

France's rapid development of its forestry industry is primarily due to a complete and rigorous set of regulations. From the 1115 land survey law for forest land to the present, there are 36 national regulations.

France's implementation of a three-tier ownership system is beneficial for the development and protection of forestry. The state and local governments own 3.6 million hectares of forest, while private ownership accounts for more than 10 million hectares, divided among more than 2 million forest owners. To enhance private forestry initiatives, the state has implemented strong support policies. It is reported that since 1946, France has established the "National Forest Fund" (accumulated from taxes on forest products), providing low-interest loans and subsidies to forest owners. Monsieur Monot said that over the decades, the total expenditure of this fund has reached 170 billion francs. To better address the funding issues for private forestry development, local forestry investment committees have been established in recent years. In terms of technology and management, the state has also established regional forestry centers in various areas for supervision and guidance. As for state-owned and local forestry, they are uniformly led by the state's forestry management department. They regard forest protection as a crucial task in developing forestry, mainly including preventing diseases, pests, pollution, and fires.

### 欲要林养人　人必先育树  绿满法国

　　欲要林养人　人必先育树
    绿满法国
    本报记者  张启华
    法国　法国的森林面积达１４００万公顷，占国土面积１／４以上，是欧洲共同体国家中的森林大国之一。
    森林向人们的奉献不仅具有社会效益，经济效益也十分可观。据农林部介绍，林产品每年给法国带来１４００亿法郎的收入。巴黎的森林，每年接待国内外游人１亿多人次。维持生态平衡，也被视为发展林业的重要任务，南方的阿基旦松林就有固沙之利。
    “欲森林养人，人必首先养树”。农林部的技术顾问莫诺先生说，法国在战后的几十年间，一直有计划地发展林业。每年造林约５万公顷。使战后的人工林面积迅速增加２００多万公顷，公路林带１５０００公里。新增加的林地多为荒坡野岭，从而使全国的绿色空间不断扩大。
    法国林业发展迅速，首先是因为有一套完整、严密的法规。法国从１１１５年制订的森林土地丈量法开始，到现在涉及全国性的法规有３６种。
    法国执行的三级所有制有利于发展、保护林业。国家和地方占有的森林为３６０万公顷，私有林达１０００万公顷以上，分属２００多万个林主所有。为了提高私人造林的积极性，国家采取了有力的扶持政策。据介绍，从１９４６年起，法国设立了“国家森林基金”（从林产品抽取的税金积累起来），向林主提供低息贷款和补助。莫诺先生说，几十年来，这笔基金支出总数达１７００亿法郎，为了更好地解决私人发展林业的资金问题。近年来，各地还建立了林业投资委员会。在技术、经营管理方面，国家还分片成立“地区林业中心”，加以监督和指导，至于国营和地方的林业，则由国家的林业管理处统一领导。他们把保护森林作为发展林业的一项极为重要的工作，主要包括防止病虫害、污染和火灾。
