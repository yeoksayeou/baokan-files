The real estate trading market in Chengdu has been open since last October. In just over four months, more than 170 transactions have been completed, and now people are making such transactions every day. However, because room prices and land prices are not separated, homeowners are selling not only their own property but also the land that belongs to the state when they sell their houses. Therefore, a large amount of money that should belong to the state has flowed into the pockets of individuals or enterprises.

Retired worker Luo, who bought 46 square meters of dilapidated rooms for tens of thousands of yuan (old currency 10,000 yuan equals new currency 1 yuan) in 1951, is now struggling to repair the house due to lack of funds. He sold 21 square meters of it for 9,000 yuan. Qiu has a 42.8 square meter wooden house, each square meter sold for over 1,500 yuan, totaling 65,000 yuan. It is easy to imagine that even the house itself cannot be sold for such a high price.

It is reported that the vast majority of the selling price goes to the homeowner, and the trading market only collects 3% of the total price. Of this 3% income, the market and the Municipal Housing Management Bureau Property Supervision Office share it in a 7:3 ratio, with the market getting 7 and the supervision office getting 3, while the state does not get a single cent.

Due to the profitability of real estate operations, various companies for land development and housing development have emerged like mushrooms after rain. It is understood that there are more than 20 such companies in Chengdu alone, and even a small city like Deyang has 7.

It is reported that Hong Kong manages urban land by leasing it, with the house following the land. Land prices and rents have become an important source of income for the Hong Kong government. In mainland China, however, land has long been used without compensation, with phenomena such as illegal occupation, early occupation, late use, or privatization of public land widely existing, which must be solved as soon as possible.

### 房价地价要分开——房地产交易市场提出的新问题

　　房价地价要分开        
    ——房地产交易市场提出的新问题
    本报记者  罗茂城
    成都市房地产交易市场从去年１０月开放以来，短短四个多月，成交１７０多笔，现在每天都有人在作这种交易。但是，由于目前房价地价不分，房主在卖房的同时，把本来属于国家所有的地产也卖掉了。因此，大量本应属国家收入的钱，流入了个人或企业的腰包。
    退休老工人罗某，１９５１年花了几十万元（旧币１万元等于新币１元）买到４６平方米的几间平房。现在，房子已破烂不堪，苦于无钱维修。于是，他出卖了其中的２１平方米，以９０００元成交。邱某有一间４２．８平方米的木板房，每平方米卖价高达１５００余元，总计６．５万元成交。不难想象，光房屋，无论如何卖不到这么高的价钱。
    据介绍，所卖房款绝大部分为房主所得，交易市场只收房款总额的３％。在这３％的收入中，市场与市房管局房产监理处三七分成，市场得７，监理处得３，国家则一分钱也未得。
    由于经营房地产有利可图，各种牌号的以征地或拆迁建房出售的土地开发公司、房屋开发公司便雨后春笋般地冒出。据了解，仅成都市就有２０余家，小小德阳市也有７家。
    据了解，香港对城市土地的管理，实行批租的办法，房随地走。地价、地租成为香港政府重要财源之一。而内地，长期以来对土地采取“无偿使用”的办法，乱占滥用、早占迟用、占而不用或化公为私等现象大量存在，必须尽快加以解决。
