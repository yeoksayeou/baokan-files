Editor's Note: Today, we publish a series of letters from readers that reflect various difficulties faced in agricultural production in some rural areas. The readers not only raise problems but also analyze them based on actual situations. We hope that relevant government departments will pay attention to the issues raised in these letters, conduct a comprehensive analysis of their causes, and formulate effective countermeasures.

Ensuring Increased Agricultural Investment is Implemented

Recently, I conducted a survey in some counties in western Henan and found that most farmers have not yet received the materials they need for spring farming. Fertilizers and pesticides required for winter wheat management have not been purchased, mainly due to a lack of funds among these farmers.

The reasons for the lack of agricultural investment implementation are as follows:

First, local financial allocations to agriculture have decreased. Most funds are used for township enterprises, construction, and administrative expenses. Some townships have not even allocated funds for agriculture.

Second, the Agricultural Bank is reluctant to lend. Due to the long loan period, small loan amounts, low profits, and high risks associated with agricultural loans, the Agricultural Bank reduces the proportion of agricultural loans when arranging funds. Some Agricultural Banks even pass this task entirely to credit cooperatives, which lack the capacity to lend to farmers.

Third, farmers' grain sales proceeds cannot be redeemed. Due to financial shortages, most banks issue IOUs to farmers who sell grain. According to one farmer, his family sold dried potatoes last autumn and earned over 1,100 yuan, but the bank only paid 100 yuan in cash, which was barely enough to buy one bag of high-priced urea.

We appeal to all levels of party and government departments to take measures to ensure that the work of increasing agricultural investment is truly implemented.

### 增加农业投入要落到实处

专栏：心里话

　　编者按：今天刊登的这组来信，从不同侧面反映出目前农村一些地方在生产中面临的困难。读者在来信中不仅提出了问题，而且还从实际情况出发，作了一些分析。我们希望政府有关部门能重视来信中反映的这些问题，进一步综合分析产生的原因，以便制定出有效的对策。
    增加农业投入要落到实处
    最近，我在豫西一些地县调查，了解到大部分农户今年春耕生产需要的物资尚未到手，麦田越冬管理需要的化肥、农药至今仍未购买，主要是这些农民缺少资金。
    导致农业投入未落实的原因是：
    一、地方财政对农业的投入减少，大部分资金用于办乡镇企业、搞建设及行政费开支，有的乡镇甚至没有安排农业用款。
    二、农业银行不愿贷款。由于农业贷款周期长，金额小，利润低，风险大，农业银行在安排资金计划时，尽量降低农业贷款的比例，有的农业银行甚至把这个任务全部推给信用社，而信用社又无力给农民发放贷款。
    三、农民的卖粮款不能兑现。由于资金紧缺，大部分银行给卖粮的农民打白条。据一户农民反映，他家去年秋天卖薯干收入１１００多元，银行只付给现金１００多元，仅够买１袋高价尿素。
    呼吁各级党政部门采取措施，把增加农业投入的工作真正落到实处。
