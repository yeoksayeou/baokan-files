The U.S. is currently considering a diplomatic policy proposal towards the Soviet Union, which involves exchanging the Soviet Union's relaxation of political and military control over Eastern European countries for a U.S. and Western countries' pledge not to interfere in the affairs of the region.

The U.S. State Department spokeswoman, Margaret Tutwiler, said today that the proposal, which was announced by Secretary of State Baker yesterday, aims to promote "democratic self-determination and individual freedom" in Eastern European countries. She claimed that there are already "encouraging signs" in some Eastern European countries moving in this direction.

However, Baker himself, in an interview with The New York Times, said that in implementing this proposal, one must be cautious, "so as not to give the impression that we are moving closer to the Soviet Union and dividing Eastern Europe."

Baker said that this proposal was put forward by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.

Our reporter Zhang Qixun reports from Washington, March 28: The new U.S. Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, said today that although the Soviet Union is not as aggressive as before, the U.S. should still be cautious. The U.S. will deploy a certain missile defense system to deter potential Soviet nuclear attacks.

Cheney, in outlining his defense stance to television reporters, said that the "Star Wars" plan of the Reagan administration was an overly exaggerated proposal, but if it is a system that can deter a Soviet first strike and thus enhance deterrence capabilities, that is another matter, and it must be considered in conjunction with the modernization of land-based missiles. It is reported that the Bush administration is considering a missile defense system called "Brilliant Pebbles," which involves placing a large number of small missiles in space orbits to intercept incoming missiles.

　　美在东欧问题上同苏讨价还价        
    切尼称美将部署导弹防御系统遏制苏联
    新华社华盛顿３月２８日电  美国政府目前正考虑一项对苏外交政策建议，以苏联放松对东欧国家的政治和军事控制换取美国及西方国家不介入该地区事务的承诺。
    美国国务院发言人塔特怀勒今天说，由国务卿贝克昨天公布的这一建议旨在促进东欧国家中的“民主自决和个人自由”。她宣称，一些东欧国家中目前已经出现了朝着这一方向迈进的“可喜迹象”。
    但贝克本人在接受《纽约时报》采访时说，在实施这一建议时还应小心谨慎，“不应让人认为，我们正在同苏联接近并且正在分割东欧。”
    贝克说，这一建议是由前国务卿基辛格提出的。
    本报华盛顿３月２８日电　记者张启昕报道：美国新任国防部长切尼今天说，尽管苏联不像以前那样咄咄逼人，美国对苏联还应小心谨慎。美国将部署某种导弹防御系统，以遏制苏联可能的核进攻。
    切尼在对电视记者概述他的防务立场时说，里根政府时期被过于夸大的“星球大战”计划是项非常遥远的建议，但如果是一种能遏制苏联第一次打击、从而提高威慑能力的系统，那是另一回事，就必须与陆基导弹现代化一起加以通盘考虑。据称，布什政府正在考虑一种被称为“灿烂卵石”的导弹防御系统，在空间轨道布下大批小导弹，阻击来犯的导弹。
