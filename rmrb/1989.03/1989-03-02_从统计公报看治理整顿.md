The National Bureau of Statistics has published the 1988 National Economic and Social Development Statistical Report, which was fully released yesterday. 1988 was a year of significant fluctuations in China's economic life. The economic and social development situation of that year is of great concern to people from all walks of life. The publication of the statistical report provides a relatively comprehensive set of data. A serious analysis and study of the statistical report not only helps to understand the trajectory of our country's progress in the past year but also helps to further clarify the direction for the future.

The report both reports good news and bad news. It tells us that in 1988, China's national economy developed through deepening reforms and accelerating opening up, economic strength was further enhanced, external economic exchanges expanded, and education, science and technology, culture, and health care saw new developments. It also tells us that there are prominent problems, mainly that social demand is too strong, supply-demand total quantity contradictions and structural contradictions are intensifying, and prices are rising too rapidly, resulting in obvious inflation.

Statistical figures show that China's economic structural contradictions are not easing but are intensifying. The industrial growth rate reached 20.7%, while the agricultural growth rate was only 3.2%. Within agriculture, the production of grain, cotton, and oilseeds all saw negative growth. The rapid growth of industry is not in line with the slow development of agriculture. Within industry, the growth of processing industry and rural industry is too fast, while the growth rates of raw coal, crude oil, and steel are only between 2.2% and 5.2%. The development of energy and raw materials is obviously lagging. Last year, the cargo turnover of railways and highways increased by 4.3% and 4.8% respectively, again showing that the slow growth of transportation capacity is not in line with the high-speed development of the entire national economy. These structural contradictions are a serious obstacle to China's sustained, stable, and coordinated economic development.

From the long-standing contradiction of social total demand exceeding total supply, there are new developments. Although great efforts were made last year to compress construction, the total investment in fixed assets nationwide still grew by 18.5%, and the investment in non-productive construction such as buildings and halls reached 51 billion yuan. In this situation, coupled with the further expansion of social purchasing power, the supply-demand gap ratio in 1988 compared to 1987 did not narrow but expanded from 13.6% to 16.2%. This inevitably led to obvious inflation, rapid price increases, and a decrease in the actual income of some residents.

In summary, the achievements of 1988 are significant, but the problems are also acute, and the economic situation is still quite severe. From this, it can be seen that the decision made at the end of September last year by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee to resolutely implement the policy of rectifying the economic environment, restoring economic order, and deepening reforms is completely correct. Moreover, after several months of rectification and order restoration, initial results have been seen. The momentum of rapid price increases has been curbed, progress has been made in compressing the scale of fixed asset investments, social purchasing power has been controlled, the work of rectifying companies is being deepened, the chaotic situation in circulation is beginning to improve, and the state's macro-control capabilities are gradually increasing. Without the policy of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the subsequent arduous work, the problems shown in the statistical report would certainly be much more serious. The initial changes over the past five months have eased people's doubts and gradually increased their confidence: as long as we continue to firmly implement the policy determined by the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the difficulties in economic life can be gradually overcome.

    从统计公报看治理整顿
    本报评论员
    国家统计局公布的1988年国民经济和社会发展统计公报已于昨天全文发表。1988年是我国经济生活发生较大波动的一年。这一年的经济和社会发展的情况究竟怎样，社会各界人士都很关心。统计公报的发表，为人们提供了一份较为全面的资料。认真分析研究统计公报不仅便于了解去年我国行进的轨迹，更有助于进一步明确今后的走向。
    公报既报喜，又报忧，既告诉我们：1988年我国国民经济在深化改革、加快对外开放中发展，经济实力进一步增强，对外经济交流扩大，教育、科技、文化、卫生事业有了新的发展；又告诉我们：存在的问题很突出，主要是社会需求过旺，供求总量矛盾和结构性矛盾加剧，物价上涨过猛，出现了明显的通货膨胀。
    统计数字显示出我国经济的结构性矛盾不是缓和了，而是在加剧。工业增长率高达20.7％，农业增长率只有3.2％，而农业内部的粮食、棉花、油料的生产都是负增长，工业过快增长与农业低速发展不相适应。在工业内部，加工工业、乡村工业发展过快，而原煤、原油、钢的增长幅度只达2.2％至5.2％之间，能源、原材料的发展显然是滞后的。去年，铁路、公路货物周转量分别增长了4.3％和4.8％，又显示出交通运输能力的缓慢增长同整个国民经济的高速发展不相适应。这些结构性的矛盾对于我国经济持续、稳定、协调的发展是一个严重的障碍。
    从多年积累下来的社会总需求超过总供给的矛盾来看，又有新的发展。尽管去年用了很大力气去压缩基建，但是全国固定资产的投资仍然增长18.5％，楼堂馆所等非生产性建设投资达到510亿元之多。在这种情况下，再加上社会集团购买力的进一步膨胀，1988年同1987年相比，供需差率不是缩小了，而是从13.6％扩大到16.2％，这就不能不导致通货明显膨胀、物价迅猛上涨以及部分居民实际收入下降。
    总而言之，1988年的成绩很大，问题也很尖锐，经济形势还是相当严峻的。由此可见，去年9月底党的十三届三中全会决定坚决采取治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的方针，是完全正确的，而且经过近几个月的治理、整顿，已经初见成效。物价上涨过猛的势头已被遏制，压缩固定资产投资规模已有进展，社会集团购买力受到控制，整顿公司的工作正在深入展开，流通秩序混乱的状况开始扭转，国家宏观调控的能力逐步增强。如果没有十三届三中全会的方针及随后的艰苦工作，统计公报所展示的问题肯定严重得多。5个月来的初步变化使人们的疑虑有所缓解，信心逐步增强：只要继续坚定不移地贯彻十三届三中全会确定的方针，经济生活中出现的困难是可以逐步克服的。
