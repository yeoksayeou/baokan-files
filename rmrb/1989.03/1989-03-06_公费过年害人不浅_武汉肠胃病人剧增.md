Recently, the number of patients visiting major hospitals in Wuhan has suddenly increased, with a significant number of cases involving relapses of stomach diseases, acute gastroenteritis, food poisoning, and acute pancreatitis. According to investigations, one major cause is the distribution of New Year goods using public funds.

Tongji Medical University Affiliated Hospital conducted a survey, revealing that in February of this year, out of 48,164 patient visits, 8,436 cases were due to overeating, excessive drinking, or consuming spoiled food, leading to relapses of stomach diseases, acute gastroenteritis, food poisoning, and acute pancreatitis. On average, there were over 300 such cases per day.

Reporters visited some patients' families and discovered that many units in Wuhan have made it a trend to use public funds for New Year celebrations. According to a survey of 180 households on ShangHai Street, each household received between 300 to over 2,000 yuan worth of food. With so much food, how can it all be consumed or stored? Additionally, Wuhan's higher-than-usual temperatures this year have caused many foods to spoil, leading to wastage.

　　公费过年害人不浅
    武汉肠胃病人剧增
    据新华社武汉３月５日电  （实习生王汉清、记者杨正文）近日来，武汉市各大医院就诊人数突然剧增，其中胃病复发、急性胃肠炎、食物中毒和急性胰腺炎等病患者居多，据调查，一个重要原因是公费年货所致。
    同济医科大学附属协和医院做了一个统计，今年２月份，在该院就诊的４８１６４人次中，因暴饮暴食、酗酒或吃了变质食物引起的胃病复发、急性胃肠炎、食物中毒、急性胰腺炎等病例，达８４３６人次，平均每天３００多人次。
    记者就此事走访了一些病患者的家庭。发现武汉市一些单位今年春节公费过年成风。据对上海街１８０户市民的走访调查，每户多者分了２０００多元钱的食物，少的也分有３００多元钱的年货。如此多的年货如何吃得下，存得住？加之武汉今年气温较高，不少食物久存变质，只好白白扔掉。
