Title: Waste and Pollution Seen Through the Flow of Excrement

Including the floating population, Beijing has over 10 million people. Each person excretes several kilograms of feces daily, and multiplying these two figures results in an astronomical number. How much of this returns to nature, to the land?

All the feces from residential buildings are sent to septic tanks for general dilution and liquefaction, then flow through the sewers and eventually end up in rivers on the outskirts of the city, spreading pollution. This severely contaminates the water sources, breeds pathogens, and harms both humans and animals. Apart from residential buildings, Beijing's eight urban districts have several hundred public toilets that produce over 4,000 tons of feces daily. These feces are transported out of the city by the sanitation department.

Most of the feces transported out of the city are sold, with only 15-20% finding a market. The rest, which cannot be sold, are dumped into certain rivers.

It is unclear when the notion that "modernizing agriculture no longer requires farm manure" became popular. Meanwhile, the price of chemical fertilizers has soared.

Chemical fertilizers indeed play a crucial role in increasing agricultural yields. According to relevant experiments, one kilogram of pure nitrogen can increase wheat production by 5.9-6.1 kilograms (equivalent to 1.2 kilograms of wheat per kilogram of ammonium sulfate), and one kilogram of pure phosphorus (P2O5) can increase wheat production by 5.7-6.3 kilograms (equivalent to 0.7-0.8 kilograms of wheat per kilogram of superphosphate). Clearly, chemical fertilizers offer quick benefits to land contractors.

At the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, an expert introduced the fertilization situation in Beijing: the amount of chemical fertilizer (using nitrogen as an example) applied per mu in 1977 was 10.1 kilograms, but by 1987, it had reached 61.5 kilograms. According to the general requirement for organic matter in soil, the amount of organic fertilizer applied per mu per year should be 4,000-6,000 kilograms. However, the average annual application of organic fertilizer in Beijing's grain fields is far below this level. Due to the excessive use of chemical fertilizers, the organic matter in the soil has decreased. Generally, good grain fields should have an organic matter content of around 2.4%. However, the average organic matter content in Beijing's grain fields is only around 1.43%, which is obviously too low.

Here, we see the two extremes of a vicious cycle: one extreme is severe pollution, and the other is severe waste. Soil fertility is declining, while the import of chemical fertilizers requires an unknown amount of foreign exchange. The production of chemical fertilizers consumes an unknown amount of raw materials, coal, and electricity.

When will this vicious cycle end?

### 从粪便流向看浪费和污染

　　从粪便流向看浪费和污染
    加上流动人口，北京市有１０００多万人，每个人每天要排泻粪便数千克，二者中间加个乘号真是个天文数字，它们有多少回归自然、回归了土地呢？
    所有居民楼的粪便都是入化粪池进行一般稀释溶化处理后，入下水管道，七折八弯最后都到郊外的河流之中去“四处漂溢”，严重污染了水源，病菌繁衍，人畜遭殃。除了居民楼，北京市８个城区的几百个公共厕所，每天还产生粪便４０００多吨，这些粪便都是由环卫部门搬运出城。
    拉出城的粪便一般销纳１５—２０％，大部分销不出去的，只好在某某河扔掉了。
    不知从何年开始，“搞农业现代化不再需要农家肥”的观念流行了。化肥则身价倍增。
    化肥对于农产品的增产确实起着重要的作用。据有关试验表明：一公斤纯氮增产小麦５．９—６．１公斤（折合１公斤硫铵增产１．２公斤小麦），１公斤纯磷（P2O5）增产小麦５．７—６．３公斤（折合１公斤过磷酸钙增产０．７—０．８公斤小麦）。显然，化肥对土地的承包者来说有急功近利之效。
    在北京市农业局，一位专家介绍了北京土壤的施肥情况：亩施化肥（以氮为例）１９７７年为１０．１公斤，而１９８７年达到了６１．５公斤。按一般土地所需有机质含量，每年亩施农肥应达到４０００—６０００公斤，而北京粮田平均年亩施有机肥大大低于这个水平。由于大量施用化肥，土壤有机质下降，一般较好的粮田有机质含量应２．４％左右。而北京地区粮田有机质含量平均才１．４３％左右，显然是偏低的。
    在这里，我们看到恶性循环的两极，一极是严重污染。一极是严重浪费。土壤肥力下降，而化肥进口不知道要花多少外汇，化肥生产不知道要浪费多少原材料，浪费多少煤、多少电。
    这种恶性循环何时了？
