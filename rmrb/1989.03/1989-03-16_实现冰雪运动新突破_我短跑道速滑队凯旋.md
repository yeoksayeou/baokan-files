The Chinese short track speed skating team that participated in the Sofia World University Winter Games returned to Beijing this afternoon. Xu Yansheng, deputy director of the State Sports Commission, who went to the airport to welcome them, said that the results they achieved in this competition represent a breakthrough in the history of China's ice and snow sports.

In this University Winter Games, Chinese short track speed skaters won a total of 5 gold medals and 2 silver and bronze medals each. The female athletes' performance was particularly outstanding (4 gold medals, 1 silver medal, 2 bronze medals). Xu Yansheng believes that the term "breakthrough" is not merely because they won a few more gold medals, but more importantly, these results have boosted confidence and courage for the development of China's ice and snow sports, especially key projects like short track speed skating.

Coach Xin Qingshan of the Chinese short track speed skating team introduced that 80% of the world's top athletes participated in this competition. The Chinese women's team is a world powerhouse, and their main competitors in this competition were Italy and Japan. He also said that the results of this contest did not show a significant breakthrough. This is due to the tactical nature of short track speed skating, which often affects the results. Therefore, in this competition, the struggle between the strong teams and the rankings are more indicative of the situation.

The athlete who won the most medals for the Chinese team this time is a 19-year-old girl from Jilin, Guo Hongru. She consecutively won the gold medals for the 1000m, 1500m individual, and 3000m relay races, as well as the bronze medal for the 500m individual race.

In the 4th World University Winter Games held four years ago, short track speed skating was included as a competition event, and at that time, only female athletes from China won 2 bronze medals.

China's short track speed skating has made rapid progress in recent years and has now reached the world's advanced level. More and more people are joining this sport.

　　实现冰雪运动新突破
    我短跑道速滑队凯旋
    新华社北京３月１５日电  （记者梁希仪）参加索非亚世界大学生冬运会的中国短跑道速滑队今天中午回京。前往机场迎接的国家体委副主任徐寅生说，他们在这次比赛中取得的成绩是中国冰雪运动史的一次突破。
    中国短跑道速滑选手在本届大学生冬运会上共获得５枚金牌和银、铜牌各２枚，其中女选手的成绩尤为突出（４枚金牌、１枚银牌、２枚铜牌）。徐寅生认为，说取得突破倒不仅仅是因为多拿了几块金牌，更重要的是，这些成绩对开展我国冰雪运动、特别是像短跑道速滑这类我国冰雪重点项目增添了信心和勇气。
    中国短跑道速滑教练辛庆山介绍，８０％的世界好手都参加了这次比赛。中国女队是世界强队，这次比赛的主要竞争对手是意大利和日本。他还说，这次角逐的成绩没有很大突破。这是由于短跑道速滑的战术性较强，往往影响成绩的缘故。因此，在这一比赛中，强队之间的拚搏和名次是比较能说明问题的。
    中国队这次获奖牌最多的是１９岁的吉林姑娘郭洪茹。她先后夺得１０００米、１５００米个人和３０００米接力赛３枚金牌，以及５００米个人铜牌。
    在４年前的世界大学生冬运会上，短跑道速度滑冰曾被列为比赛项目，当时中国只有女选手获得２枚铜牌。
