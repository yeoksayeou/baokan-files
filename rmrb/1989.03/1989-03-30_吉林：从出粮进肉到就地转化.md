Every year, the Northeast region exports a large amount of corn to the interior while importing 100,000 tons of pork from the interior. This is equivalent to at least 400,000 tons of corn being "re-imported," which not only wastes manpower and resources but also increases the pressure on transportation. What should be done? Liu Jiang proposes—

Jilin Province is an important commercial grain base in China. Over the past 10 years, due to the implementation of various policies and the promotion of advanced scientific technologies, the province's grain production has increased significantly. By 1988, the total grain production had reached 16.98 billion kilograms, an increase of 85.1% compared to 1978. The per capita grain possession is the highest in the country.

Although Jilin has abundant grain, its conversion rate is low, and a large amount of commercial grain needs to be transported out to realize its value. After a bumper harvest, the problems of insufficient storage and transportation are quite common. Meanwhile, pig production has developed slowly, and pork supply has long been unable to meet local demand, requiring an annual import of 20,000 tons from outside the province. Long-term pork imports from outside the province not only exacerbate the supply-demand contradiction of pigs in the interior, increase national and local financial subsidies, but also result in long-distance transportation from the south to the north. Moreover, importing 1 ton of pork from outside the province is equivalent to importing 4 tons of corn, which is essentially a round-trip transportation, adding to the pressure on railway transportation.

How to utilize Jilin's abundant corn resources to vigorously develop commercial pig production? People have been thinking about this for many years, but the problem of pigs growing for half a year in a year due to the cold climate in the north has not been solved, and no solution has been found.

In the past two years, the comprehensive matching pig-raising technology with plastic greenhouses as the main body has been successfully tested, demonstrated, and promoted in rural areas, bringing hope for the local conversion of grain. In 1988, Jilin Province comprehensively summarized and promoted the comprehensive pig-raising matching technology with plastic greenhouses as the main body in Lishu County. The so-called "four good and four changes" were implemented: good housing, changing winter cold housing to warm greenhouse housing; good breed, changing local pigs to hybrid improved pigs; good feed, changing single feed to full-price compound feed; good method, changing traditional "hanging frame" pigs to linear fattening. Using this new technology, the temperature in the pigsty in winter can be increased by 10 degrees during the day and 20 degrees at night. Winter fattening can increase by more than 500 grams per day, and the feed-to-meat ratio can reach 3.5 to 4:1, achieving two batches of pigs per year in cold northern regions, with significant effects. Currently, the number of pigs raised in greenhouses in the province has reached 977,000, accounting for about 1/5 of the winter raising quantity, and continues to maintain a good momentum of development.

While promoting new technologies, in May of last year, the provincial government further liberalized the purchase and sale policies for pigs. According to investigations, adopting "four good and four changes" and price liberalization, farmers can earn a pure income of 50 to 80 yuan per pig, making pig raising an important path to prosperity.

Currently, the pork production and sales gap in the Northeast region is about 100,000 tons. If Jilin can achieve self-sufficiency in pork without affecting the national grain allocation plan, it can support Liaoning and Heilongjiang. The entire Northeast region can also reduce the import of 100,000 tons of pork each year, equivalent to reducing the export of 400,000 tons of corn. This not only makes full use of the conversion advantages of the Northeast corn belt, eases the pressure on railway transportation, but also makes a positive contribution to the national balance of pig production and sales. More importantly, the development of pig production will lead thousands of households to the path of prosperity and gradually become an important industry in rural economic development.

The strategic vision of transforming the Northeast region from exporting grain and importing meat to local conversion is of great significance and far-reaching influence. The following measures must be taken at present.

(1) Formulate specific plans and clarify the direction of development. Jilin Province's proposed three-step plan target and the basic idea of emphasizing agricultural areas and suburban areas, stabilizing pastoral and mountainous areas are reasonable and feasible. In the relatively long period in the future, it is still necessary to adhere to the policy of mainly family breeding, with the state, collective, and individuals all participating, and to take the road of socialized services combined with family breeding, with enterprises leading farmers, relying on technological progress and scale breeding to improve commercial production capacity.

(2) Strengthen infrastructure construction. (1) Strengthen the breeding system of superior breeds. (2) Strengthen the feed system. (3) Strengthen the disease prevention and control system. (4) Strengthen the slaughtering, processing, and cold storage facilities to improve the market's absorption and adjustment capacity for pork.

(3) Adjust policies to ensure balanced growth of supply and demand. First, cancel the import of pork to Jilin Province; gradually reduce the allocation of pork to the Northeast region, with the supply-demand gap filled by Jilin Province; establish Jilin Province's pork export allocation plan according to the development situation.

(4) Mainly adjust internally to achieve a balance between the supply and demand of protein feed. The main task is to adjust the planting structure in the Northeast region, appropriately increase the production of leguminous crops; develop leguminous forage, achieve multiple substitutions for protein feed; the state should strictly control the export of cake and meal to Jilin Province and the Northeast region, and gradually reduce it, stopping the export within three to five years.

(5) Broaden channels and increase funding for the pig industry. Funds should be raised through multiple channels and forms, relying mainly on local and public self-raising, with appropriate state support. First, local governments should increase their investment. Second, mobilize the public and society to raise funds. It can adopt the method of public stock participation or joint operation, or establish inter-regional production and sales economic cooperation zones, through the formulation of preferential policies, attract cities, factories, and enterprises to invest in the production area to set up farms. At the same time, the state should provide appropriate support.

　　吉林：从出粮进肉到就地转化
    东北地区每年向关内调运大量玉米，同时从关内调去十万吨猪肉，这等于至少有四十万吨玉米“倒流”，这既造成人力物力的浪费，也增加了运输的压力，怎么办？刘江设想——
    吉林省是我国重要的商品粮基地。近１０年，由于各项政策的落实和先进科学技术的推广，全省粮食大幅度增产。到１９８８年，粮食总产已达１６９．８亿公斤，比１９７８年增长８５．１％。人均占有粮食量居全国首位。
    吉林虽然粮多，但转化水平低，大量商品粮需靠外运才能实现价值。丰收之后，储不下、运不走的现象较为普遍。与此同时，生猪生产却发展缓慢，猪肉供应长期不能自给，每年需从省外调进２万吨。长期从省外调肉，不仅加大了关内生猪的产销矛盾，增加了国家和地方的财政补贴，而且南肉北调，运距较远。况且，从省外调进１吨猪肉，等于又调回了４吨玉米，实际是往返运输，加重了铁路运输的压力。
    如何利用吉林丰富的玉米资源优势，大力发展生猪商品生产？人们思考多年，但都因北方气候寒冷，一年养猪半年长肉的问题没有解决而找不到出路。
    近两年，以塑料暖棚为主体的综合配套养猪技术在农村成功试验、示范、推广，给粮食就地转化带来了希望。１９８８年，吉林省全面总结推广了梨树县以塑料暖棚为主体的综合养猪配套技术。实行所谓“四良四改”，就是良舍，改冬季冷舍养猪为扣暖棚养猪；良种，改本地猪为杂交改良猪；良料，改单一饲料为全价配合饲料；良法，改传统“吊架子”猪为直线育肥。采用此项新技术，冬季猪舍内温度白天可提高１０度，夜间可提高２０度，冬季育肥日增重５００克以上，料肉比达到３．５至４∶１，做到了北方寒冷地区一年出二茬猪，效果十分明显。目前，全省扣棚饲养的生猪已达９７．７万头，占寒冷季节饲养量的１／５左右，并继续保持着良好的发展势头。
    在推广新技术的同时，去年５月，省政府又进一步放开了生猪购销政策。据调查，采用“四良四改”和价格放开，农民养一头猪纯收入在５０元—８０元左右，已成为农民致富的重要门路。
    目前，东北地区猪肉产销缺口在１０万吨左右。如果吉林在不影响国家粮食调拨计划的基础上，就地转化，率先达到猪肉自给有余，既可支援辽宁、黑龙江；整个东北地区每年也可少调进１０万吨猪肉，相当于减少调出４０万吨玉米。这不仅可以充分发挥东北玉米带的转化优势，缓解铁路运输的压力，还将对全国生猪产销平衡做出积极贡献。更为重要的是，生猪生产的发展将带动千家万户走上致富之路，并逐步成为农村经济发展的重要产业。
    实现东北地区从出粮进肉到就地转化的战略设想，意义重大，影响深远。目前必须抓好以下措施。
    （一）制定具体规划，明确发展方向。吉林省现在提出的三步规划目标以及突出农区和城郊，稳定牧区和山区的基本思路是合理和可行的。在今后较长时期内，还应坚持家庭饲养为主，国家、集体、个人一齐上的方针，走社会化服务与家庭饲养相结合，企业带农户的路子，依靠科技进步和规模饲养，提高商品生产能力。
    （二）加强基础设施建设。（１）加强良种繁育体系建设。（２）加强饲料体系建设。（３）加强疫病防治体系建设。（４）加强屠宰加工和冷藏设施建设，提高猪肉市场的吞吐、调节能力。
    （三）调整政策，保障产需均衡增长。首先取消对吉林省猪肉的调入；逐年减少对东北地区猪肉的调拨，供需缺口由吉林省替补；根据发展情况，建立吉林省的猪肉出口调拨计划。
    （四）以内部调节为主，实现蛋白饲料供求平衡。主要是调整东北地区的种植结构，适当增加豆科作物的生产；发展豆科牧草，实现蛋白饲料的多种替代；国家对吉林省和东北地区的饼粕出口要严格控制，并逐年减少，三五年内停止出口。
    （五）广辟渠道，增加对养猪业的资金投入。资金筹集应坚持多渠道、多形式，立足于地方、群众自筹为主，国家适当扶持的原则。首先是地方政府应增加投入。其次是发动群众和社会集资。既可采取群众入股或联办的方式，也可建立跨地区的产销经济协作区，通过制定优惠政策，吸引城市、工厂、企业在产区投资办场。同时国家要适当扶持。
