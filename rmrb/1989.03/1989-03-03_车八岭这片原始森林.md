In an era where the sound of logging is ubiquitous and forests are shedding tears and blood, the emergence of a pristine primitive forest seems like a fleeting dream. However, it is a university professor who has turned this dream into reality.

In the early 1980s, a mountain road was hastily built into this vast expanse of primitive forest. The Forestry Bureau and the Forestry Farm decided to collaborate, aiming to log the entire stock of 410,000 cubic meters of premium timber. Renowned forestry expert and professor from South China Agricultural University, Xu Yanqian, who had just surveyed the forest, urgently appealed: "It must not be cut down! It must not be cut down!" He presented his findings from the field, stating that the forest was rich in plant and animal species, a "treasure trove of biodiversity" and the "jewel of Nanling." He proposed to establish a nature reserve as soon as possible.

Professor Xu's call was timely and powerful, and the axes and saws were put down. This rescued and protected primitive forest is Cheba Ling.

Cheba Ling is located in the southeastern part of Shixing County in northern Guangdong. It covers an area of 88,000 acres. The main peak, Tianping Jia, stands at 1,256 meters above sea level. It is a transitional zone between the South Asian and North Asian tropical regions, home to more than 2,000 plant species, more than the total number found in central and northern China. The abundant plant resources provide an ideal habitat for wild animals. Species from the north and south converge here, with birds flying, beasts roaming, deer calling, and tigers roaring, making the forest lively.

Last winter, we had the fortune to visit and personally witness the rare wonders of Cheba Ling. As we entered the reserve through the "North Gate," we saw the dense layers of trees, wild and charming, pushing the sky into narrow slits and forcing the path to dodge left and right. They often stretched out their branches to tug at our clothes, as if welcoming us warmly. Rows and clusters of cypresses and camellias hung with strings of flowers, like bouquets and firecrackers prepared just for us. Those rare trees that usually hide deep in the forest, such as the cypress, three-pronged fir, horse-ear tree, umbrella flower tree, and wild soybean, all revealed their true beauty and elegance. In the valley, we saw a 44-meter-high fir tree, so large that several people couldn't wrap their arms around it. Its rough bark, straight trunk, and swaying green leaves displayed a majestic and heroic spirit. This "green forest hero" took over 200 years to shape the image of the tallest and largest fir tree in Guangdong.

According to Professor Xu Yanqian's plan, the Cheba Ling Nature Reserve is divided into four management areas: the absolute protection area, the scientific research area, the restoration and utilization area, and the introduced species recovery area. Led by a forest ranger, we quietly explored the absolute protection area of Danzhubeng. At the entrance, a wooden sign boldly read: "Protecting tigers is a merit, hunting tigers is a crime!" We stepped on the fallen leaves, mustering our courage to move forward, feeling a sense of tranquility mixed with excitement. Naturally, we couldn't encounter all the small parrots, large water deer (commonly known as mountain cows), golden civets, spotted large cats, tree-dwelling short-tailed monkeys, shy musk deer, golden leopards, sika deer, yellow-bellied tragopans, black storks, pangolins, and various other birds and beasts.

"Where is the South China tiger?" As we were about to leave, we couldn't forget the sign about protecting tigers. The staff honestly told us: every year, tiger roars are heard in the reserve, and tiger footprints and droppings have been found. The South China Endangered Animal Survey Team confirmed that Cheba Ling hides the rare South China tiger, and they advised us to be careful not to wander around next time we visit.

    车八岭这片原始森林
    蔡常维
    在伐木声四起，森林流泪又流血的今天，新冒出一个濯濯荡荡的原始森林，似乎是一个飘渺的梦，而把梦境变成现实的是一位大学教授。
    80年代初期，一条山间急造公路开进这片茫茫的原始森林，林业厅与林场首次合作，决心伐林取木，拿下总蓄积量41万立方米的上等木材。刚刚考察过这片林海的著名林业专家、华南农业大学教授徐燕千奔走呼号，高声大喊：砍不得！砍不得！他用自己实地调查的结果说明：密林中动植物资源极其丰富，可称为“物种宝库，南岭明珠”，建议尽快建立自然保护区。
    徐教授的呼吁及时而有力，举起的锯斧放下了。这片被抢救、保护下来的原始森林就是车八岭。
    车八岭地处粤北始兴县东南部，总面积8.8万亩。主峰天平架，海拔1256米。它是南亚热带和中亚热带的过渡地带，繁衍着2000多种植物，植物种类超过我国中部和北部的总和。丰富的植物资源又为野生动物提供了理想的栖息地，南北动物种属汇集于此，禽飞，兽走，鹿鸣，虎啸，山林显得十分活跃。
    去冬，我们有幸前往，亲身领略了车八岭的罕见奇观。当我们从“北门”进入保护区时，只见那重重叠叠的树木带着野性的爱娇，把天空挤成缝，把小路迫得左闪右躲，还时时伸出枝丫牵住你的衣裳，表示对你的亲切的挽留。成行成片的苍山子、腊梅，挂起串串花朵，像是早就为你准备好了的花束和鞭炮。那些平日藏在密林深处，不肯轻易露芳容的珍稀树木，如观光木、三尖杉、伯乐树、伞花木、野大豆等都用自身的美姿和神韵显出真颜。山坳里我们看见一株高44米，数人合抱不了的杉树，那粗砺的树皮，笔直的主干，摇曳的绿叶，显示出威武雄壮的树魂。这位“绿林好汉”花了200多年功夫，才塑造出广东省内最高、最大的“杉树王”的英雄形象。
    按徐燕千教授的规划，车八岭自然保护区划分为四个管理作业区，即绝对保护区、科学研究区、改造利用区和引种恢复区。在护林员的带领下，我们进入单竹坑绝对保护区悄悄一游。路口一块木牌赫然写着八个大字：“保虎有功，猎虎违法”！我们踏着落叶，壮着胆子往前走，感到静谧中带有骚动。自然，林中小若一指的鹦鹉、大如牛马的水麝（俗称山牛）、金黄的果子狸、斑花的大灵猫、吊挂树上的短尾猴、羞于见人的乌獐，还有金钱豹、梅花鹿、黄腹角雉、黑鹳、穿山甲、苏门羚等多种飞禽走兽，我们不可能一一幸会。
    “华南虎呢？”临别时，我们不忘那个“保虎”的告示牌子。工作人员实话相告：保护区内年年闻虎啸，还发现老虎的脚印和粪便。经华南濒危动物考察队证实，车八岭隐藏着罕见的华南虎，叮嘱我们下次来时不要乱跑，小心一点为妙。
