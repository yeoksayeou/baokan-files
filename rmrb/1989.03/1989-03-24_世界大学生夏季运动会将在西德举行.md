The 1989 World University Summer Games will be held in West Germany.

	BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) — The city of Duisburg in the Federal Republic of Germany will host the 1989 World University Summer Games in August this year.

	This announcement was made by the International University Sports Federation on the 22nd. It concludes two months of deliberation by the federation to select a venue for the games, which are second only to the Olympics in terms of comprehensive sports events.

	The World University Games are held every two years. This edition was originally scheduled to be held in São Paulo, Brazil, but was later canceled due to financial issues.

	Prior to this, Kiev in the Soviet Union was another candidate city to host the games.

	Although Duisburg can hold the games as originally scheduled from August 20 to 30, it will not be able to host all 10 events. Only athletics, rowing, men's basketball, and fencing will be held.

　　世界大学生夏季运动会将在西德举行
    新华社北京３月２３日电  布鲁塞尔消息，联邦德国的杜伊斯堡将于今年８月承办１９８９年世界大学生夏季运动会。
    这一消息是国际大学生体联２２日宣布的。它结束了国际大学生体联两个月来对选择这一仅次于奥运会的综合性运动会会址的探索。
    世界大学生运动会每两年举办一届，这届运动会原订在巴西圣保罗举行，后因财政问题，圣保罗宣布放弃主办。
    在此之前，苏联基辅是承办这届运动会的另一个候选城市。
    杜伊斯堡虽然能够按原定时间于８月２０日至３０日举行运动会，但却无法承办全部１０个项目的比赛，届时将只进行田径、赛艇、男子篮球和击剑４项比赛。
