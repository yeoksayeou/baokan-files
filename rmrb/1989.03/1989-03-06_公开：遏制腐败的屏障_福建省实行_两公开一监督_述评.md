Corruption is currently a hot topic among the masses. How to curb corruption? The Party and the government have repeatedly emphasized strict party discipline and regulations, and punished corrupt officials. However, corruption has not been effectively curbed. Practice has shown that a power restraint mechanism must be established to eliminate the arbitrariness and variability of those in power, preventing corrupted power from running amok.

Over the past year, Fujian Province has strengthened the construction of clean governance by starting from the openness of administrative procedures, openness of administrative results, and relying on public supervision. The province selected 20 departments and 10 counties for pilot projects, and the results have proven that—

Transparency is a new mechanism with constraints

In the past, administrative work, including matters closely related to the masses, was conducted in a very secretive manner. Even if the work was fair, the masses still had doubts. The less transparent the work, the more opportunities it provided for those who engage in malpractices.

When it comes to recruiting staff or workers, personnel and labor department officials would complain, "People come to find me at work, block me on the way home, and wait for me at home." Letters of recommendation would fly around, resulting in those who should be recruited not getting in, while those who should not get in. Favoritism would offend others, making it difficult to please everyone.

However, once this matter is made public, through a fair competition process to select the best, the results are posted publicly and accepted by the masses for supervision, the situation changes dramatically.

Last year, Nanping City recruited 29 staff members, with over a thousand applicants. However, only about a hundred had the courage to enter the examination room. A fair competition eliminated 90% of those who wanted to take the wrong path. A single exam paper selected 29 people from over a hundred. The selected candidates accounted for only 2% of the applicants. If it were not made public, how much effort would it take to select 20-30 people from a thousand? How many people would be involved in pulling strings? How much corruption would be generated and spread among them! It is evident that even under the current system, transparency can produce a new mechanism with constraints.

Transparency should break through the most vulnerable points for power-money exchanges

Transparency cannot be rushed. If it is rushed, the outcome is often that it fizzles out quickly. Fujian adopts a solid, results-oriented, step-by-step approach, avoiding formalism.

Through questionnaires, the province selected units and departments that directly interact with residents and enterprises, and from there, identified the positions and links with the most public complaints and the highest likelihood of power-money exchanges and favoritism as the breakthrough points for transparency. The administrative basis, procedures, results, and deadlines are made public to facilitate public supervision.

Lianjiang County used transparency to address the "three chaotic" issues in personnel, land, and financial management. They investigated and published one batch after another, allowing the public to supervise. As a result, over 80 county-level and bureau-level officials who illegally occupied land to build houses were punished, and 29.5 million yuan in illegal funds were recovered. Yongtai County, to solve the problem of unfair fertilizer distribution, made the distribution principles, quantities, and prices public, effectively curbing the improper practices in fertilizer distribution. Nanping City, targeting the loopholes in forestry logging approvals, published the administrative procedures and fee standards. Changle County made the public approval and review processes for overseas travel and residency in Hong Kong public, and within half a year, under public supervision, 29 applicants were found to have falsified information, their certificates and passports were revoked, and the responsible parties were punished. The Provincial Taxation Bureau made the tax collection procedures public, effectively preventing tax officials from accepting bribes, abusing power, and dereliction of duty...

Transparency is for supervision, and a supervision system including functional departments, democratic parties, mass organizations, media, and the public must be established. Problems found during supervision must be resolutely and promptly addressed to make transparency effective. Places in Fujian with good clean governance are all related to the leaders' personal integrity and their willingness to tackle hard issues. After Pinghe County seriously investigated and punished a major case of profiteering from sugar smuggling, they held a clean governance announcement meeting, making the investigation results public, which had a strong impact throughout the county.

Transparency is the first step in democratic political construction

In the past, tense relations between officials and the masses in some places were partly due to a lack of communication and understanding. After the administrative procedures and results were made public, the masses understood how the government works, and the situation improved.

Because the administrative procedures and deadlines were made public, the pressure from the masses forced the government to change its work style and improve efficiency: matters that should be handled, you cannot easily avoid; with deadlines, you cannot easily delay; to act according to law and regulations, the handling personnel must be familiar with the business, understand laws and policies, "confused meals" cannot be eaten, and those with low qualifications cannot handle the work. This not only promotes clean governance, enhances officials' sense of responsibility, but also improves their professional skills and enhances their initiative.

During the transition from a planned economy to a market economy, when administrative behavior, market behavior, and enterprise behavior have not yet been strictly regulated by law, power-money exchanges and other corrupt behaviors are most likely to occur. Therefore, clean governance, as a long-term and arduous systematic project, will continue throughout the transformation from a planned economy to a market economy. Clean governance is not the responsibility of any single department; it should be a joint effort by the entire society. From Fujian's practice, it is clear that coordination between upper and lower levels and between departments is necessary. Some matters cannot be addressed by departments alone; some matters cannot be handled by local governments alone. As some comrades have said: economic development and clean governance are the two wings of revitalization. Without one, takeoff will be unbalanced. Clean governance plays a significant role in reform and opening up, maintaining social stability and unity, and promoting the current rectification and regulation. Clean governance is, in fact, an essential part of establishing a new order for socialist commodity economy.

　　公开：遏制腐败的屏障
    ——福建省实行“两公开一监督”述评
    本报记者  张铭清
    腐败现象，是当前群众议论的一个热点。
    如何遏制腐败？党和政府三令五申，严格党纪政纪，惩治贪官污吏。但是，腐败现象并没有得到有效的遏制。实践证明，必须建立一种权力制约机制，以消除掌权柄者办事的随意性和多变性，防止变了质的权力在歧途上运行。
    一年来，福建省从公开办事制度、公开办事结果、依靠群众监督入手，加强廉政建设。全省选择省直２０个部门和１０个县区进行试点，结果证明——
    公开是有约束力的新机制
    过去，机关办事，包括那些与群众密切相关的事，都搞得十分神秘。即使办事公正，群众也还是有怀疑。办事越不透明，越给营私舞弊者以可乘之机。
    一提到招干、招工，人事、劳动部门的同志就叫苦不迭，“上班有人找，路上有人堵，回家有人等”，条子满天飞，结果是该进的进不来，不该进的倒进来了，顾了张三得罪了李四，弄得里外不是人。
    可是，这件事一旦公开进行，通过平等竞争程序择优招收，结果张榜公布，接受群众监督，情形就大不一样了。
    南平市去年招干２９人，报名者达千人之众，可有胆量进考场的不过百余人，一个平等竞争把９０％想走歪门邪道的人给堵了回去。一张考卷又把２９人从百把人中挑了出来。入选者只占报名的２％。如果不是公开，要从千人中挑２０来人不知要耗费多少精力？不知要牵动多少人来走后门，其中又不知有多少腐败现象滋生蔓延！可见，即便在现行体制下公开，也会产生有约束力的新机制。
    公开要从最易发生权钱交易处突破
    公开，不能一哄而起，一哄而起的结局往往是一哄而散。福建采取的是扎实进行、注重实效、逐步推开、不搞形式主义的办法。
    通过问卷调查，全省选择了直接与居民和企业打交道的单位和部门，又从中找出群众意见最大、最容易发生权钱交易、以权谋私的部位和环节作为公开的突破口，向群众公开办事依据、程序、结果和期限，以便于群众监督。
    连江县用公开的办法治理人事、土地和财务管理中的“三乱”，查清一批公布一批，让群众监督，结果８０多名占地盖房的科局级干部受到处理，清出违纪财务金额２９５万多元。永泰县为解决化肥分配不公问题，把化肥的分配原则、数量、价格公之于众，有效地堵住了化肥分配中的不正之风。南平市针对林区采伐审批中的漏洞，公布办事制度和收费标准。长乐县把群众意见最大的出国审批、赴港定居工作，实行报批手续公开、审批结果三榜公布，仅半年就在群众监督下查出２９名弄虚作假的申请对象，吊销了他们的证件和护照，查处了有关责任者。省税务局公开办税制度，有效地防止了税务人员贪赃枉法、弄权渎职……
    公开是为了监督，必须建立包括职能部门、民主党派、群众团体、舆论机关和群众在内的监督体系。对监督中发现的问题进行坚决及时的查处，才能使公开行之有效。福建廉政建设搞得好的地方，无不与那里的领导自身廉洁和敢于碰硬有关。平和县在严肃查处倒卖白糖牟取暴利的大案后，召开廉政公告大会，把查处结果公之于众，在全县引起了强烈反响。
    公开是民主政治建设的第一步
    过去，一些地方干群关系紧张，一个重要原因是相互间缺乏沟通和了解。公开了办事制度和结果后，群众知道了机关是怎么办事的，彼此有所了解，情况就好多了。
    因为公开了办事程序和期限，群众的压力迫使机关作风转变和办事效率提高：该办的事，你想不办，不那么容易；有了期限，你想拖下去就不好交代；要做到依法办事、照章办事，经办人必须熟悉业务，掌握法令政策，“糊涂饭”吃不得了，素质不高干不了，又逼着办事人员学习钻研业务。这不仅促进了廉政建设，增强了干部的责任心，也提高了他们的业务素质，增强了他们的进取心。
    处在新旧体制交替、商品经济日趋活跃，而行政行为、市场行为和企业行为尚未通过法制形式严密规范的时候，权力和金钱交换等腐败行为最容易滋生蔓延。因此，廉政建设这一长期、艰巨的系统工程，将贯穿于产品经济向商品经济转化的始终。抓廉政建设不是哪个部门的事，应该全社会一起抓。从福建的实践看，必须上下配合，条块结合。有些事，条条不讲话，块块抓不动；有些事，块块不动手，条条抓不了。正如有的同志说的：经济建设和廉政建设是振兴的两翼，缺少一个，起飞就要失衡。廉政建设对改革开放、维护社会安定团结，对当前进行的治理、整顿的促进作用是显而易见的。廉政，实际是建立社会主义商品经济新秩序的题中应有之义。
