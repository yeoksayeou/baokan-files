Japan has unearthed what is believed to be its oldest artifact, a bronze mirror inscribed with the name of a Chinese craftsman. The discovery was made yesterday in the 51st ancient tomb at Gongen Mountain in Hyogo Prefecture. Scholars involved in the excavation say the artifacts, dating back to the latter half of the 3rd century, are the earliest ever found in Japan.

Among the unearthed items are five triangular-rimmed beast mirrors, fragments of clay figurines, bronze arrowheads, iron swords, and axes. This is the first time that triangular-rimmed beast mirrors and clay figurines have been found together. Three of the five mirrors bear the names of their Chinese makers. It is said that similar beast mirrors have not been found in China or Korea.

In the early 3rd century, there was a kingdom in western Japan known as Yamatai, ruled by a queen named Himiko. Historical records show that in 238, the queen sent envoys to the capital of the Wei Dynasty, Luoyang. The Wei Emperor conferred upon Himiko the title of "King of Wa, Friend of Wei" and presented her with a gold seal and a purple ribbon. There are differing opinions among scholars about the location of Yamatai, with some suggesting it was in the Kyushu region and others in the Kinki region. The recent discovery of these important artifacts provides new evidence for determining the location of Yamatai, sparking great interest among Japanese archaeologists and historians.

　　日本发现最古老的文物
    本报东京３月１２日电  记者于青报道：铭文中记有中国制造者姓名的三角缘神兽镜昨天从日本兵库县境内权现山第５１号古墓中出土。参加发掘的学者认为，这批公元三世纪后半期的文物，是迄今在日本发现的最早期的文物。
    出土文物中有５枚三角缘神兽镜、若干陶俑碎片、铜箭头、铁剑和斧子等。三角缘神兽镜和陶俑同时出土还是首次。５枚三角缘神兽镜中的三枚上有中国制造者的姓名。据说同类兽镜还未见在中国和朝鲜出土。
    公元三世纪初，日本西部地区有一个以女王“卑弥呼”为首的邪马台国。史载２３８年，女王第一次派使臣到当时的魏国首都洛阳。魏明帝曾授与“卑弥呼”为“亲魏倭王”称号和金印紫绶。关于邪马台国所在地，学界有不同说法，一说在九州地区，一说在近畿地区。新出土文物的重要发现，为考证邪马台国所在地提供了新的材料，引起日本考古学和历史学者的极大兴趣。
