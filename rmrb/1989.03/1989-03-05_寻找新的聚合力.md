	Seeking New Cohesive Forces
	Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Yani and Li Zhenghua

	Almost all enterprises face a dilemma: the inflation of bonus amounts and the growth of labor productivity are not proportional! Traditional ideological and political work has also lost its former authority. Where is the oasis in the spiritual world of enterprises? What force can effectively unite our team? A batch of outstanding enterprises in Shanghai started from this point to—

	Seek New Cohesive Forces

	Enterprises are not just "profit machines," and enterprise members are not merely the realizers of efficiency.

	"Work and family are the two pillars of life. For workers, half of their life's aspirations are vested in the enterprise. The enterprise should become the destination of workers' life values."

	Shanghai Solvent Factory Director Zhou Boxiua takes this view as an important principle in leading the enterprise. He has been reflecting on a question: how to understand the function of enterprises? The basic function of enterprises is to create profits, but if enterprises are completely equated with "profit machines," the status of workers as the main body of the enterprise will be weakened or even reversed. Now, even Western countries are beginning to explore the cohesive force of "enterprise culture" centered on people. Why don't we, a country that has always valued spiritual factors, play to our strengths?

	Thus, in early 1987, when the term "enterprise culture" was not yet fashionable, Zhou Boxiua included it in the "Shanghai Solvent Factory Green Book," which serves as the enterprise's development outline, and elaborated it as "respect, understanding, equality, and participation." In 1988, the factory implemented a labor and personnel system reform, and Zhou Boxiua's procedure was to start with cadres and then workers. At that time, although he had been appointed by the competent department, he insisted on a full-vote, secret ballot, and announced on the spot that if the votes did not exceed 2/3, he would resign. The entire factory's workers showed unusual concern and interest, and the voting results showed that 75.81% were in favor.

	Subsequently, there was a top-down, step-by-step election and appointment, all conducted in a democratic procedure, with no one able to override the selection and votes with personal will. Zhou Boxiua used such seemingly extreme methods to instill a cultural consciousness.

	Many enterprise leaders, in their confusion over various phenomena, also had similar epiphanies. They unanimously introduced this "culture" into their thinking, which was full of numbers.

	Shanghai Coal Transportation Company has many workers who were once disillusioned with their jobs, calling the company's location, Shanggang District 7, "being cheated, suffering, and eating coal and dust." With such a mindset, going to work every day was akin to hard labor. However, while many enterprises lament the dispersion of their workforce, here, dedication is the norm.

	In Shanghai Coal Transportation Company, people of different levels and types can find places that suit their needs. Young people with special talents and hobbies can join interest activity groups, skilled female workers can go to the "Women's World," old workers have the "Fortune Hall" for entertainment, and busy cadres have the "One Relaxation" dance party. On the night of the annual company arts festival, a group of young workers crossed the river to see their wharf and their company. Such a change in workers' mindset is probably difficult to achieve with just institutional management alone.

	The central position of the factory director determines his influence on the enterprise's spirit, style, and values.

	Just after the New Year of 1988, in a few high-rise offices in the Shanghai Ruijin Building, a small "second textile machine fever" arose. For half a month, groups of people came here every day to explore. It turned out that Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory was recruiting 150 technical and management personnel from society. The recruitment advertisement highlighted the "technology-based factory" principle but did not promise "attractive remuneration." However, the number of applicants reached 1,800. Among them, many were cadres and engineers with good jobs in Shanghai's urban areas, and the second textile machinery factory is geographically Shanghai's "Siberia"! Just two years ago, this factory was "unable to recruit and retain," and from 1984 to 1986, 450 people "jumped ship" in three years, accounting for 1/10 of the total number of workers in the factory! In just two years, how did the second textile machinery factory gain such a strong appeal?

	Let's ask a few applicants to answer:

	The second textile machinery factory has a director who "dares to be the first in the world," and it's exciting to work under such a "leader";

	The leadership team is full of vitality, and joining such an enterprise has a future;

	...

	People's job choices are increasingly being attracted by the charm of entrepreneurs.

	The development of a commodity economy has pushed entrepreneurs to the forefront of the economic stage. The role of entrepreneurs is becoming increasingly prominent. An outstanding entrepreneur can make an enterprise "rise from the dead" and become a strong player in a competitive environment filled with "rivals"; while an unqualified enterprise manager may cause a promising enterprise to lose its luster.

	Shanghai Second Textile Machinery Factory Director Huang Guancong and the leadership team of this factory are indeed unique in style. In 1987, Huang, the director, was the first in Shanghai's large and medium-sized enterprises to voluntarily apply for full-employee contracting; last year, they were the first to strive for foreign trade export earnings contracting; in the same year in October, they also "squeezed" into the ranks of trial-point enterprises with liberalized operations.

	The result of this proactive reform is that the factory's profits increased by 19.5% and 28.4% in two years, respectively, and export earnings soared from $5,000 in 1985 to $11.28 million in 1988. Meanwhile, workers' living and welfare have also improved significantly.

	Huang Guancong believes: the charm of an entrepreneur is not just a spirit of exploration and courage; it must also have an inspiring demeanor and transparent behavior.

	In the early days of contracting, workers had high expectations for their personal income after contracting, and their understanding of the leadership's relevant distribution policies was not the same, causing the entire factory to be full of discussions. Huang Guancong and the factory leadership decided to launch a "dialogue" activity with workers, using collective heart-to-heart talks to explain the contents of the contract, distribution principles, and leadership intentions clearly, finally winning the workers' praise and support. Now, this dialogue has become an institution in the factory, with at least one session held every month.

	It is with such a style and demeanor that Huang Guancong and his partners have made the "second textile machinery factory" establish an image of a "self-recommended, forward-looking reform trial-point enterprise" in society; within the enterprise, this high-density, fast-paced thinking and progress have put everyone in a state of excitement and urgency. A new worktime quota has increased the efficiency of each position by an average of 15.88%. All meetings, party and league activities, as well as environmental cleaning, are conducted during off-duty hours. Here, there is no director's trouble of "one hand grasping material civilization and one hand grasping spiritual civilization" and being "overwhelmed." He uses this bold and vivid style to shape the enterprise's image, like a magnet, infecting and attracting all the cadres and workers in the factory. Who can say this is not political and ideological work?

　　寻找新的聚合力
    新华社记者  陈雅妮  李正华
    几乎所有的企业都面临着一个困扰：奖金额的膨胀和劳动生产率的增长并不
    成正比！而传统的思想政治工作又失去了往日的权威。何处是企业精神世界
    的绿洲？靠什么力量有效地聚集我们的队伍？上海一批优秀企业从这个起点
    上，开始——
    寻找新的聚合力
    企业不仅是“利润机器”，企业成员也不止是效益的实现者。
    “工作和家庭，是人生的两大支点。对于工人来说，他的人生寄托有一半在企业，企业应该成为职工人生价值的归宿。”
    上海溶剂厂厂长周伯华把这个观点作为他领导企业的一项重要原则。他一直在反省一个问题：究竟怎样认识企业功能？企业基本功能是创造利润，但是如果把企业完全等同于“利润机器”，职工作为企业主体的地位也就淡化甚至颠倒。如今连西方国家也开始探索以人为中心的“企业文化”的内聚力，我们这个历来重视精神因素的国度，为什么不发挥自己的优势？
    于是，１９８７年初，在“企业文化”这个外来语尚未时髦起来的时候，周伯华就将它写进了作为企业发展大纲的《上海溶剂厂绿皮书》，并将它演绎为“尊重、理解、平等、参与”。１９８８年工厂实行劳动人事制度改革，周伯华的程序是先干部后工人。当时，他虽然已由主管部门任命，但坚持要来一次全员无记名投票，并当场宣布，票数不过２／３自动辞职。全厂职工表现出异乎寻常地关切和兴趣，投票结果，赞成票占７５．８１％。
    以后便是由上而下的逐级竞选、聘任，完全按民主程序进行，谁也不能以个人意志来左右人选和选票。周伯华就是用这样一些看上去有点极端的办法，灌输一种文化意识。
    许多企业领导人在对种种现象的困惑中，也有类似周伯华的顿悟，他们不约而同地在满是数字的思考中，引入了这种“文化”。
    上海煤炭装卸公司有许多职工曾经对自己的工作厌烦透了，称公司所在的上港七区是“上当吃亏，倒霉（煤）吃灰”。怀着这种心情，每天上班，无异于是苦役。可是如今，就在许多企业慨叹职工队伍涣散时，这里却敬业成风。
    在上海煤炭装卸公司，各个不同层次、不同类型的人都能找到适合自己需要的场所。有特长爱好的年轻人可以参加兴趣活动小组，心灵手巧的女职工可以去“女子大世界”，老工人有“福禄宫”消遣，劳碌的干部们有“一轻松”舞会。在一年一度的公司艺术节之夜，一群青年工人结伴渡江，要隔着黄浦江看看自己的码头，看看自己的公司。职工这种心态变化，仅仅靠制度管理恐怕是难以实现的。
    厂长的中心地位，决定着他对企业精神、风格、价值观的影响。
    １９８８年元旦刚过，在上海瑞金大厦几间高层写字间里，兴起了一股小小的“二纺机热”。一连半个月，每天都有成群结队的人来此探寻。原来，上海第二纺织机械厂正向社会招聘１５０名技术和管理人员。招聘广告上亮出的是“科技立厂”宗旨，并没有“待遇从优”的许诺，但填表报名者竟达１８００之众。这里面不少是在上海市区有一份好工作的干部、工程师，而二纺机从地理位置上讲，可是上海的“西伯利亚”！就在前两年，这个厂还“招不进，留不住”，从１９８４年到１９８６年，３年有４５０人“跳槽”，占全厂职工人数的１／１０！仅两年时间，二纺机何来这么大的吸引力？
    不妨请几位应聘者来回答：
    二纺机有个“敢为天下先”的厂长，跟着这样的“头”干起来有劲；
    领导班子有生气，投靠这样的企业有奔头；
    ……
    人们择业的眼光，正在被企业家的魅力所吸引。
    商品经济的发展把企业家们推到了经济舞台的前面。企业家的作用日益突出。一位优秀的企业家，可以使企业“起死回生”，在“敌手”林立的竞争中成为强者；而不称职的企业经营者，也可能会使前景灿烂的企业失去光辉。
    上海第二纺织机械厂厂长黄关从以及这个厂的领导集团，确实风格独异。１９８７年，在上海大中型企业中，黄厂长第一个主动要求试行全员承包；去年，他们第一个争取外贸出口创汇承包；同年１０月，他们又“挤”进了放开经营试点企业的行列。
    这种主动改革的结果，使工厂在两年时间里，利润分别增长１９．５％和２８．４％，出口创汇由１９８５年的５０００美元，猛增到１９８８年的１１２８万美元。而职工生活福利也随之得到较大改善。
    黄关从认为：企业家的魅力，并不仅仅是因为一种开拓精神，一种勇气，它还必须具有动人的气度和透明的行为。
    这个厂承包初期，职工们对承包后的个人所得期望很高，对领导的有关分配政策理解也不尽相同，全厂议论纷纷。黄关从和厂领导决定与职工开展“对话”活动，用集体谈心的形式把承包内容、分配原则、领导意图解释得一清二楚，终于赢得职工的好评和支持。现在这种对话已在厂里形成制度，每月至少举行一次。
    黄关从及其伙伴们正是以这样一种风格和气度，使“二纺机”在社会上树立一个“毛遂自荐、超前改革试点企业的形象；在企业内部，这种高密度快节奏的思考和行进，使得上上下下都处于一种兴奋和紧迫之中。一个新的工时定额，就使各个岗位的效率平均提高１５．８８％。所有的会议、党团活动以及环境清扫，全部在业余时间进行。在他这里，没有许多厂长“一手抓物质文明，一手抓精神文明”而“分身无术”的苦恼，他就是用这种浓墨重彩的大写意塑造着企业的形象，像磁铁一样感染和吸引着全厂的干部职工。谁能说这不是政治思想工作呢？
