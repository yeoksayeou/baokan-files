On the evening of March 28th, the night before the World Table Tennis Championships began, the Chinese table tennis team held a heart-to-heart meeting at the Queen Hotel where they were staying. Xu Yansheng and Li Furong shared their experiences and lessons from participating in multiple World Table Tennis Championships, offering several pieces of advice to the younger team members.

Xu Yansheng recalled his first participation in the World Table Tennis Championships 30 years ago, saying, "At that time, I had a certain level of skill and really wanted to perform well, but I lacked confidence. As a result, I couldn't hold my ground in crucial moments and regretted it for a long time." He said, "Now is the time for us to strive for the honor of our country and repay the nation for its nurturing. We must cast aside all personal desires and distractions, and focus all our energy on playing well in the matches."

Li Furong said, "I remember during the 36th World Table Tennis Championships, we introduced Cai Zhenhua. Before the team final, some people saw Cai lose a match and began to question whether he should play against the Hungarian team. After discussing with other coaches, we believed that Cai Zhenhua's playing style was advantageous against the Hungarian team. In practice, it was proven that he was the right choice."

　　战胜对手要先战胜自己        
    ——徐寅生、李富荣赛前谈体会
    ３月２８日晚，世乒赛开幕前夜，中国乒乓球代表团在下榻的皇后旅馆开了一个谈心会。徐寅生、李富荣用自己多次参加世乒赛的经验体会和教训，对年轻队员谈了几点希望。
    徐寅生回忆起３０年前第一次参加世乒赛情景时说：“当时我具备了一定实力，也很想打好，可就有点信心不足。结果在关键时刻没有顶上去，自己懊悔了很久。”他说，现在正是需要我们为祖国荣誉而拚搏以报答国家培养之际，必须抛弃一切私心杂念，集中全力打好比赛。李富荣说：“记得第３６届世乒赛上我们启用蔡振华。团体决赛前，有人见小蔡失利过一场，便对是否用他打匈牙利队产生动摇。我和其他教练商量后认为，蔡振华打法对打匈牙利队有利，实践证明他上对了”。
