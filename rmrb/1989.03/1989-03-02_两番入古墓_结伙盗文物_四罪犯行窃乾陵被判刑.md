Four criminals who broke into Qianling to steal cultural relics have been sentenced.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, XI'AN, March 1 - (Correspondent Zhang Huaxin) Four criminals who infiltrated Qianling to steal valuable cultural relics from the museum have recently been sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison by the Qian County People's Court in Shaanxi Province.

In April 1988, Liu Chunli, Liu Xiangcun, Liu Suicun, and Liu Yangshen, farmers from Beizhai Village, Yuling Township, Lingbao County, Henan Province, conspired to break into the Qianling Museum in Shaanxi. They entered the side passage of the accompanying tomb of Princess Yongtai in Qianling and stole 2 female horse-riding figurines (second-class cultural relics), selling them for 1200 yuan and squandering the money. On June 4, they once again broke into Qianling and stole 8 precious artifacts, including a Tang tri-colored screen hat figurine from the accompanying tomb of Prince Zhanghuai, before fleeing back to Lingbao.

The public security authorities have recovered all the stolen cultural relics. The Qian County People's Court recently sentenced Liu Chunli to 10 years in prison, and the other three were sentenced to 3, 5, and 9 years in prison respectively.
