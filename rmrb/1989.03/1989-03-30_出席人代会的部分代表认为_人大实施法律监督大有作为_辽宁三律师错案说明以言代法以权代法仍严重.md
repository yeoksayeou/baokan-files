Some representatives attending the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress (NPC) believe that the NPC's legal supervision has great potential. The case of three lawyers in Liaoning shows that "rule by speech" and "rule by power" are still severe.

A report by this newspaper, "The National People's Congress Exercises Legal Supervision According to Law, and Liaoning Corrects a Case of Wrongful Arrest of Lawyers," has been widely discussed by some representatives attending the session. They generally believe that the supervisory role of the National People's Congress is being strengthened and has great potential.

The famous lawyer Wang Gong, a representative of the Seventh National People's Congress, who had advocated for the correction of the case of the three lawyers in Liaoning during the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, said that although the case had gone through many twists and turns, it was finally corrected. This is a true reflection of the difficult progress of China's legal system. Given the current state of China's legal system, handling and publicizing major typical cases can significantly raise the public's legal awareness and strengthen socialist legal system. He suggested that the Law on the Supervision of the People's Congress be promulgated as soon as possible to institutionalize and legalize the supervisory role of the People's Congress.

Zhang Tiejun, a representative of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial People's Congress, said that the case of the three lawyers was artificially complicated, indicating that the phenomena of "rule by speech" and "rule by power" are still severe. To create a good legal environment, not only should the supervisory role of the People's Congress be strengthened, but the leadership of the Party committees at all levels over the judicial organs should also be strengthened.

Zhang Huanwen, a representative of the National People's Congress and President of the Liaoning Provincial Higher People's Court, believes that the People's Congress should exercise legal supervision according to law, and the law enforcement agencies should consciously accept supervision. The reason why the case of the three lawyers has been delayed for so long is directly related to the lack of awareness of some law enforcement agencies to accept supervision. The weak legal awareness of some law enforcement personnel, who do not handle cases according to facts and law, is also an important reason for the wrongful case.

Duanmu Zheng, Director of the Law Research Institute of Zhongshan University, said that cases of infringing upon the rights of lawyers are not just one or two. The case of the three lawyers in Liaoning was solved under the supervision of the National People's Congress, which has set a vivid example for law enforcement personnel, showing that the principles of "rule of law," "strict enforcement of the law," and "punishing lawbreakers" must be adhered to. From this principle, the direct responsible parties for this wrongful case should be held accountable; otherwise, the legitimate rights of citizens cannot be truly protected.

　　出席人代会的部分代表认为        
    人大实施法律监督大有作为 
    辽宁三律师错案说明以言代法以权代法仍严重
    本报讯  记者吴恒权报道：出席七届全国人大二次会议的一些代表，看了本报《全国人大依法实行法律监督，辽宁纠正一起逮捕律师错案》的报道后普遍认为，全国人民代表大会的监督职能正在加强，且大有作为。
    曾在七届全国人大一次会议上为纠正辽宁三律师错案呼吁的著名律师王工代表说，此案虽几经周折，但终获纠正，这是我国法制建设在艰难中前进的真实写照。鉴于我国法制还不健全的现状，通过对重大典型案件的处理和宣传，对于提高全民的法律意识，加强社会主义法制，具有明显的作用。他建议尽快制定人民代表大会监督法，使人大的监督职能制度化、法律化。
    人大代表、辽宁省人大副主任张铁军说，三律师案被人为地复杂化了，说明以言代法、以权代法的现象还很严重。要创造良好的法制环境，不仅要加强人民代表大会的监督，而且还要加强各级党委对司法机关的领导。
    人大代表、辽宁省高级人民法院院长张焕文认为，人大依法履行法律监督，执法机关应该自觉接受监督。三律师案之所以久拖不决，与一些执法机关缺乏自觉接受监督的意识有直接的关系。少数执法人员法制观念淡薄，不依事实和法律办案，也是造成错案的重要原因。
    中山大学法学研究所所长端木正代表说，侵犯律师辩护权的案件并非仅有一二件。辽宁三律师错案在全国人大的监督下得以解决，为执法人员上了生动的一课，说明有法必依、执法必严、违法必究的原则必须坚持。从这一原则出发，造成这起错案的直接责任者应该受到追究，否则，公民的合法权益难以得到真正维护。
