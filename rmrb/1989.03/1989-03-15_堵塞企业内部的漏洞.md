Plugging the Gaps in Enterprise Management

The frequent theft of state and collective property has become an increasingly serious social problem. The issues reflected in this investigative report should be given serious attention.

The losses suffered by the Linfen Steel Company due to theft are indeed staggering. The brazen actions of the thieves, on the one hand, reflect the moral degradation and weak legal awareness of some people. On the other hand, it also reflects the lack of attention and ineffective measures by local governments. However, these are external factors. The fundamental reason lies in the numerous management loopholes within the enterprise, which provide opportunities for thieves.

In fact, as long as the enterprise truly focuses on internal rectification, it is completely possible to effectively curb theft. Consider this: if the gate guards at Linfen Steel were more vigilant and the security system more stringent; if the warehouse management system were more robust and employees' responsibilities clearer; if the company strengthened legal education for its employees and their families did not join the ranks of the thieves... These measures are not difficult to implement. With determination, the trend of theft will certainly be curbed. These issues remind us that while enterprises seek to establish a harmonious external environment, they must start from their own problems, strengthen management, plug loopholes, and prevent issues before they arise.

Of course, while enterprises strictly enforce regulations, they must also resolutely strike against thieves, whether they come from outside or inside the enterprise. Those with serious offenses must be brought to justice. Only by closely integrating enterprise management systems with the law can the property of the state and the people be protected from the harm of lawbreakers.

　　堵塞企业内部的漏洞
    国家和集体财产频频被盗，这已成为一个日益严重的社会问题。这篇调查汇报所反映的问题，应该引起人们的高度重视。
    临汾钢铁公司因被盗造成的损失确实惊人，偷盗者如此肆无忌惮，一方面反映了目前一些人道德沦丧，法制观念淡漠，另一方面也反映出地方政府重视不够，制止不力。但这只是外因，问题的一个根本原因在于，企业内部管理上的漏洞太多，给偷盗者以可乘之机。
    事实上，只要真正从企业内部加以整治，是完全可以有效地制止偷盗行为的。试想想，如果临钢门岗把守认真，门卫制度严格；如果库房管理制度健全，职工职责分明；如果公司加强对职工的法制教育，职工及其家属不加入到偷盗者的行列……这些工作并不很难做到，下决心做了，偷盗之风肯定会有所收敛。这些问题提醒我们，企业在寻求建立和谐的外部环境的基础上，一定要从自身存在的问题着手，加强管理工作，堵塞漏洞，防患于未然。
    当然，在企业严格制度的同时，对那些无论是来自外部的，还是来自内部的盗贼，要坚决地给予打击，情节严重者，要绳之以法。只有把企业内部的管理制度和法制紧密地结合起来，国家和人民的财产才能避免不法分子的侵害。
