The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia Refuses to Remove Šuvaković from Office

	New Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, March 29th - The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia today issued a statement, refusing to comply with the request from the extraordinary congress of the League of Communists of Vojvodina to remove the chairman of the Central Committee, Šuvaković, from his post.

	The Central Committee made this decision after discussing the request made by the extraordinary congress of the League of Communists of Vojvodina on January 19th this year and the supplementary arguments presented by the Provincial Committee of the League of Communists of Vojvodina on February 20th.

	In mid-January this year, the media and leaders of Serbia and Montenegro began to criticize the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and its chairman, Šuvaković, by name. Subsequently, the extraordinary congress of the League of Communists of Vojvodina formally proposed to remove Šuvaković from his post on January 19th.

	At the 20th extraordinary session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia held at the end of January and the beginning of February, there was a heated debate over the responsibility of the Central Committee and its chairman, Šuvaković.

	On one hand, the central committee members from Vojvodina, Serbia, and Montenegro emphasized that the Central Committee and Šuvaković were responsible for the deterioration of the situation in Yugoslavia and demanded the removal of Šuvaković from his post.

	On the other hand, the central committee members from Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and other republics expressed disagreement with the unprincipled attacks on the Central Committee and Šuvaković, believing that the pursuit of responsibility should be realistic.

	At that time, the result of the debate was that the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia believed that the arguments presented by the League of Communists of Vojvodina for the removal of Šuvaković from his post were insufficient and that the matter would be discussed again after the League of Communists of Vojvodina provided supplementary arguments.

　　南共联盟中央主席团        
    不同意解除舒瓦尔职务
    新华社贝尔格莱德３月２９日电  南共联盟中央主席团今天发表公报，不同意伏伊伏丁那自治省共盟非常代表会议关于解除共盟中央主席团主席舒瓦尔职务的要求。
    中央主席团是在讨论伏省共盟非常代表会议今年１月１９日提出的要求和伏省共盟省委主席团２月２０日提出的补充论据后作出这一决定的。
    今年１月中旬，塞尔维亚和黑山两共和国的新闻工具和领导人开始点名批评南共联盟中央主席团及其主席舒瓦尔。接着，伏省共盟非常代表会议于１月１９日正式提出了解除舒瓦尔职务的要求。
    在１月底２月初召开的南共联盟２０中全会上，围绕着中央主席团及其主席舒瓦尔的责任问题进行了激烈的争论。
    一方面，伏伊伏丁那、塞尔维亚和黑山的中央委员强调，中央主席团和舒瓦尔对南斯拉夫局势恶化负有责任，要求解除舒瓦尔职务。
    另一方面，克罗地亚、斯洛文尼亚、波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那等共和国的中央委员则表示不同意对中央主席团和舒瓦尔进行无原则的攻击，认为追究责任应实事求是。
    当时争论的结果是，南共联盟中央委员会认为，伏省共盟要求解除舒瓦尔职务的论据不足，待伏省共盟提供补充论据后再讨论这一问题。
