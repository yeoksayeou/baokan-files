The British Embassy in Lebanon announced today that its consular office will close starting from the 14th and cease operations.

This action by Britain is to prevent retaliation from pro-Iranian militias in Lebanon due to the Rushdie incident.

The statement once again urged the 2,700 British expatriates to leave Lebanon. The statement said that the British Foreign Office is advising British citizens not to travel to Lebanon.

The largest teachers' union in Britain said on the 13th that after the uproar caused by Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses," some British schools have seen a surge in racial discrimination.

The National Union of Teachers, at the launch of its new curriculum against racial discrimination, said that white students have begun to mock their Asian classmates' religious beliefs. Incidents of racial discrimination have increased.
