This year marks the 30th anniversary of the abolition of the feudal serf system and the implementation of democratic reforms in Tibet. As a feudal serf system, it has become a thing of the past in our country. However, history cannot be forgotten; it reminds people to cherish the hard-won present and inspires them to shoulder the responsibility of building a united, prosperous, and civilized new Tibet.

Thirty years ago, Tibet's social system was a "politico-religious" feudal lord system, where the government, nobility, and upper echelons of the monasteries were the three major landlords, making up about 5% of the total population. They owned all of Tibet's land, pastures, and most of the livestock. In contrast, the serf class, which made up more than 90% of Tibet's population, had no personal freedom. Generation after generation, they belonged to the three major landlords, were forced to perform heavy labor for the landlords, and bore the heavy burden of taxes and corvée labor. They struggled year-round in poverty, hunger, and on the brink of death.

In the spring of 1959, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, Tibet carried out democratic reforms. This was a great revolution that completely buried the feudal serf system, a great change in Chinese history, and it fully aligned with the fundamental interests and urgent wishes of the broad masses of the Tibetan people. From then on, Tibet turned a new page in its history.

The bottom right shows the whip used for flogging and the finger-clamping instrument. The top right shows the serf Gedah, who had his eyes gouged out, denouncing the crimes of the serf owners during the democratic reforms: The serf owners placed heavy stone hats on the serfs' heads and struck them with stones, squeezing out their eyeballs, and then used sharp knives to gouge out the eyeballs.

    ——西藏废除封建农奴制度３０周年
    今年是西藏废除封建农奴制度、实行民主改革３０周年。作为封建农奴制，在我国已经成为昨天的历史。但是，历史不能忘记，它让人们珍惜来之不易的今天，激励人们自觉地肩负起建设团结、富裕、文明的新西藏的重任。
    ３０年前，西藏的社会制度是“政教合一”的封建领主专政的农奴制度，官家（西藏地方政府）、贵族、寺庙上层僧侣是西藏三大领主，约占总人口的５％，占有西藏的全部土地、草场和绝大部分牲畜；而占西藏总人口９０％以上的农奴阶级，却没有人身自由，祖祖辈辈属于三大领主，被迫为农奴主进行繁重的劳动，负担着沉重的差役租税，终年挣扎在贫困、饥饿、死亡线上。
    １９５９年春天，在中国共产党领导下，西藏实行了民主改革，这是彻底埋葬封建农奴制度的一场大革命，是中国历史上的一场伟大变革，它完全符合广大藏族人民的根本利益和迫切愿望。西藏历史从此翻开了新的一页。

    原西藏地方政府对农奴实行的酷刑：左上为足械刑。左下为手械刑。右下为鞭笞人的法鞭和夹手指刑具。右上为被挖去双眼的农奴格达在民主改革中控诉农奴主罪行：农奴主将沉重的石帽戴在农奴头上，用石头敲击，将眼珠挤压出来，再用利刀把眼珠剜下。
    拉萨市民主改革前的贫民区，破烂、肮脏，臭气熏天。
    一位农奴背着农奴主爬山越岭，气喘吁吁。这就是原西藏农奴制度中的“人背人”差役。
    1959年8月，西藏墨竹工卡县的翻身农奴兴高采烈地焚烧三大领主的剥削文契。
    一九五九年八月，西藏山南地区凯松溪卡胜利完成了土地改革。讨饭的农奴索朗群宗（中）分到了土地，高兴地搬起石块作地标。
