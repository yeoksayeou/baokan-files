Xinhua News Agency, Rome, March 18th.

At the 18th National Congress of the Italian Communist Party held on March 18th, General Secretary Occhietto delivered a work report to the congress.

Occhietto's report was divided into 12 parts, covering a series of major issues both domestically and internationally, within and outside the party.

When discussing the issue of peace and war, Occhietto believed that the East and West should not only end the Cold War but also avoid direct confrontations. He thought that military expenditures should be significantly reduced, and the saved funds should be used to develop human welfare, advance science, and alleviate the debt burden of Third World countries.

Regarding the reform and democratization process in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, Occhietto stated that the reforms in these countries have achieved some noticeable successes, and their significance is global and far-reaching. Of course, reforms also face some resistance and difficulties, which is natural and a part of the progress. As long as they continue on the path of reform, both the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries will benefit more.

When discussing the domestic situation in Italy, Occhietto pointed out that Italy is in a turbulent period of change. To make the country vibrant, it must undergo genuine and effective systemic reforms. Every Italian citizen, especially communists, has an unshirkable responsibility for these reforms.

In his report, Occhietto also discussed issues such as strengthening party unity, the relationship between the Italian Communist Party and other political parties, and the hopes placed on the younger generation.

Occhietto believed that without a strong and powerful Communist Party participating, it would be impossible to complete the systemic reforms in Italy. To take on this responsibility, the Italian Communist Party must strengthen its unity. For this reason, he proposed in his report the need to strengthen party unity and construction, enhance the party's combat effectiveness, and strive to fulfill the sacred mission entrusted by the times.

　　意共总书记奥凯托在１８大报告中号召
    加强团结参与意体制改革
    新华社罗马３月１８日电  在１８日召开的意大利共产党第１８次全国代表大会上，意共总书记奥凯托向大会作了工作报告。
    奥凯托的报告共分１２个部分，内容涉及意大利国内外、意共党内外等一系列重大问题。
    在谈到和平与战争的问题时，奥凯托认为，东、西方不仅应当结束冷战，还必须避免正面冲突。他认为，应当大幅度地裁减军备，把裁减下来的钱用于发展人类的福利事业、发展科学和减轻第三世界国家的债务负担。
    关于苏联及东欧国家的改革与民主化进程问题，奥凯托表示苏联及东欧国家的改革已取得某些明显的成就，其意义是全球性的、深远的。当然，改革也遇到一些阻力和困难，这是自然的，它是前进中的困难。只要沿着改革的道路走下去，无论苏联或东欧其它国家，均将获益更大更多。
    在谈到意大利国内情况时，奥凯托指出，意大利正处在一个动荡的变革时期，要使这个国家具有活力，必须对其进行真正的、行之有效的体制改革。对于改革，意大利每个公民、尤其是共产党人都有一份不可推卸的责任。
    奥凯托在报告中还谈到了加强党的团结问题、意共与其政党之间的关系问题以及寄希望于青年一代的问题等。
    奥凯托认为，要完成意大利体制改革，没有一个坚强有力的共产党参与是不行的，而意共要担当起这份责任，就必须加强党的团结。为此，他在报告中向全党提出了加强党的团结和建设、增强党的战斗力、为完成时代赋予的神圣使命而努力奋斗的要求。
