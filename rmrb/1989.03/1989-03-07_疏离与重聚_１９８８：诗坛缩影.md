Although the creative reality is diverse and confusing, and poetic concepts are polarized and contradictory, if we conduct a comprehensive and specific examination of today's poetry scene, and if we clarify long-standing misconceptions about poetry, we might be able to make a judgment about the current state of poetic creation that aligns with the inherent artistic qualities of poetry. The "unfavorable" view has some merit, but it is not comprehensive and at least does not internally express the creative trend. After the peak of poetry has faded, in recent years, there have been very few works that have sparked widespread social resonance; under the theoretical influence of advocating pure poetry, there is indeed a tendency to distance oneself from reality and avoid contradictions; a style of poetry that is obscure and mystical has a relatively large coverage. When we scan the development of poetry longitudinally, we see that it has entered a trough. But this does not mean that poetry has fallen. At the beginning of a new historical period, poets were given a long-sought opportunity to reflect on and evaluate historical merits and demerits, and to call out with conscience and passion the voices that had long been suppressed in their hearts. A deep sense of anxiety and a sharp critical edge, as the spiritual core of poetry, give poetry its vitality. This is a refutation of the false trends that have spread across the poetry scene, but it is not a sign that poetry has entered a free state. After the pattern of life changes, as industrial civilization squeezes the purification of the soul, the tentacles of poetry must extend to a broader world. Thus, poets, in their observation of the world, expand from a political perspective to a perspective of life and humanity. Perhaps the phenomena of life are forever elusive, and perhaps the mysteries of the universe are forever inscrutable, but poets open the doors to the world of humanity, to listen to the sounds of the heart, to glimpse the true face of humanity, to rediscover human existence, to re-evaluate human value, to re-search for the position that humans should occupy in the coordinate system of time and space, and to explore the desire for human transcendence and the limitations that are difficult to transcend. Poetry, from historical temporality, moves towards philosophical eternity, meaning that poetry that simply explains life phenomena is discarded. Therefore, the trend of poetry distancing itself from political interpretation is unstoppable, and the trend of non-ideological poetry is unstoppable. This is the inner current of today's poetry scene, which appears chaotic but is actually orderly.

Like all art forms, poetry cannot be separated from life or from the times, but poetry conveys human emotions in a concrete manner, so it can be called the dance of emotions; poetry releases the energy of life in the flow of emotions, so it can be called the music of the soul. It is difficult to strictly define the themes of poetry, but for the sake of convenience, we often divide poetry into those that are close to social life and those that delve into inner emotions. When poetry faces the vast and subtle world of humanity, when poetry permeates cultural consciousness and philosophical spirit, the two directions converge—like every wave that reflects a rainbow, even the externalization of a poet's personality internally and subtly expresses the era's spirit, value orientation, and aesthetic pursuit; like the vast sea that is gathered by countless rivers, even the depiction of social landscapes shimmers with individuality and human light. Ke Ping's "Poet Mao Zedong" (People's Literature, December 1988) is more about the novelty of the approach than the novelty of the conception. He depicts the spiritual demeanor of this politician who had a significant impact on Chinese history and reality, and naturally cannot avoid politics, but Ke Ping understands Mao Zedong as a person forged by history: his poetic temperament contains the accumulated essence of Chinese culture, and his poetic temperament also directly or indirectly guides the course of a segment of history. Shao Yanxiang's narrative long poem "The Last Soliloquy" (China Poets, Inaugural Issue) is about Stalin's wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, before she committed suicide, allowing us to glimpse the character and soul of another politician from a special angle. Shao Yanxiang and Ke Ping both show the dialectical law of the existence of the world and humanity: what kind of history will forge what kind of person; what kind of person will forge what kind of history.

Originally, military poetry should be the most politically charged, because war is political bloodshed. However, poetry should not be a political interpretation in symbolic form. We are pleased to see that military poetry has expanded significantly in recent years. Patriotism and the spirit of dedication are still its grand themes, but they are no longer based on unthinking adherence to a formulaic concept, but rather on a mature reflection on the value of life. In the poets' multi-dimensional thought space, humans stand at the center. Only by re-recognizing the essence of humanity can one re-recognize the meaning of life and discover and express new value judgments and new moral concepts. He Dongjiu's series of poems "The Magic Finger" (Liberation Army Literature, November 1988) expands the psychological tension field through the accumulation of images, filling it with rich philosophical connotations. He confronts a harsh fact: when death descends, life and reason both freeze, "the height of the monument and the height of the church / become stillness." Historical temporality will be submerged in the eternity of time and space, "to be forgotten is the true misfortune of yellow soil / and white bones," hoping that they, with the price of their lives, exchange for the enlightenment of reason—"when the flag of the republic soars / history gives today / a sober foundation." Poets no longer make realistic descriptions of life appearances but rather penetrate through the appearances to explore the essence of life phenomena, transforming perceptions into magical yet accurate illusions. "The feeling of the magic finger / is an absolute image / listening to the bell from the bottom of the water / appreciating a cup of tea / gradually thick, gradually thin / sometimes green, sometimes yellow." This sense of ease gives people an unprecedented surprise and a near-cruel awakening—after we have understood too much about the inevitability of history, the poet opens the door to the world of life, allowing us to glimpse a life phenomenon that is sometimes hidden and sometimes revealed: the war clouds that cover the sky often originate from the nerve endings of humans. Necessity is contained within contingency; any individual is a general. As long as human desires do not cease, wars will not end, and peace will not come through naive wishes. Liu Shixin's "Tombstone Declaration" (Stars, April 1988) is a tragic war story. The sacrifices use the tombstone as a support, and in the loneliness and sadness of being forgotten, there is a rational sublimation, beginning to face the fact that humans, in entering the vortex of war, become "a theme of contradiction between history and reality," and a "human secret" that is difficult to solve. The poet's thoughts have penetrated through the drama of survival and death, attempting to decipher the Sphinx riddle of human culture. Military poetry, from a unique angle, showcases the inner current of contemporary poetry: the simple way of presenting themes is facing a challenge. The muse of poetry soars in a broader sky where history and reality, material and spirit, subject and object are fused.

We cannot ignore the fact that the awakening of life consciousness, like a resurrected spirit, gives poetry new vitality. This is an opportunity given by the times, and it is also a fundamental characteristic of the times reflected from the depths of the human soul. People have revived the desire to transcend themselves and recognize the limitations that are difficult to transcend. Thus, poetry travels in the eternal contradictions and temporary non-contradictions, in the collisions of unity and non-unity, harmony and non-harmony between subject and object, sparking fireworks, constituting the external radiance of humanity. Zhang Junlan's "The Endless Corridor" (Tianjin Literature, May 1988) turns the pain of coexisting hope and despair, the struggle of seeking liberation and the inability to liberate, the unending human aspirations and the constantly shattered human ideals into poetic emotions, like the undulating and turbulent river of life, flowing sometimes gently and sometimes rapidly. After everything is shattered, before bidding farewell to the world, one still hopes that people can "speak more perfectly, let me take away a perfect fairy tale / even if it is a lie, it should be as perfect as possible." Life, indeed, is like an endless corridor. Choice and being chosen can be recognized but are difficult to grasp. This human limitation that is difficult to transcend, under the illumination of Eastern cultural psychology, is shrouded in a layer of mournful yet warm light. Thus, we see that at the moment of extreme sadness, "it is a day of mourning," "it is a day of celebration," "it is a life sentence," "it is a victory wreath." Liu Zhanqiu, with "Pure and Impure Lyric Poems" as the title, wrote a large number of lyric short chapters, which is the release of the light of life, the externalization of his personality, and also the expression of the awakening of humans who have gained self-awareness. Countless vivid images are the embodiments of life pulsating with blood, and at the same time, they bear the imprint of the times and culture. He also has worries, which often stem from dissatisfaction with the psychological limitations of a generation. Ideology and traditional morality weigh heavily on the soul, even to the point of alienating people. Two mutually attractive lives "are like two ships, close yet separate / wandering, wandering, wandering is the goal / disliking winter, yet fearing the scorching summer / unable to find a season of life" (Stars, May 1988). The above examples are just a few, intended to illustrate that the current state of poetic creation cannot be summarized as "unfavorable." On the contrary, poetry, under the new cultural background, is struggling to give birth and quietly expanding.

Of course, taking a lighthearted optimistic attitude towards the current creative situation will be blind or superficial in thinking. The polarization of poetic concepts leads poetry to two extremes: the former believes that poetry cannot be separated from politics and must view society and life from a political perspective, regarding the presence or absence of a sense of anxiety as the sole standard for having or not having a sense of historical responsibility, and regarding the ability to cause social resonance as the sole measure of poetic value. This ignores poetry's basic character as elite culture, reducing poetry to the level of folk songs that can only truly express emotions but lack profound aesthetic connotations, or viewing poetry as a single social tool and denying that it can also be a personal tool and a form of life. The latter, on the other hand, moves from a narrow concept to another narrow concept, leading poetry studies into the twisted alleys of pure fantasy and falling into the maze of metaphysics. "Forcing new words to express sorrow" becomes a trend, a fashion: once life consciousness is mentioned, it must be about human loneliness, human distortion, human repression, human expansion; once human self-awareness is mentioned, it is about self-exposure, self-torture, self-negation, self-expansion; once deep feelings are mentioned, it is about bitterness, sensuality, strangeness, absurdity. Thus, mutual imitation and mimicry, some poems are plain and lack emotional charm, some poems are obscure and mystical, deliberately appearing profound. These two tendencies are both hidden dangers for the development of poetry.

　　疏离与重聚
    ——１９８８：诗坛缩影
    张同吾
    虽然创作实境百态纷呈、乱花迷眼，虽然诗歌观念两极对峙、南辕北辙，假如我们对今日诗坛做全面的具体的考察，假如我们对诗澄清了由来已久的误解，也许能够对当前诗歌的创作现象做出符合诗歌自身艺术特质的辨识。“不景气”说不无道理，但不全面，至少未能内在地表述创作趋向。当诗的高峰消隐之后，近几年极少产生引起广泛社会反响的作品；在主张纯诗的理论怂动之下，的确有远离现实回避矛盾的倾向；一种艰涩的和虚玄的诗风有着较大的覆盖面。我们对诗的发展做纵向扫瞄，看到它进入了低谷。但这并不意味诗的跌落。新的历史时期开始时曾给诗人以长久寻觅终能获得的契机，去思考与评价历史功罪，并以良知和热忱呼喊出久蕴心底的声音。深切的忧患意识和犀利的批判锋芒，做为诗的精神内核而使诗获得生命力。这是对蔓延于诗坛的虚假之风的驳正，却不是诗歌进入自由状态的标志。当生活格局产生递变之后，当工业文明挤压着心灵净化，诗的触角必然要向更广阔的天地伸展，于是，诗人俯瞰世界便从政治视角扩展为人生视角和人性视角。也许生命现象永难求解，也许宇宙奥秘永难穷尽，诗人却开启通往人的世界的门牖，去谛听人的心音，去窥探人的真容，去重新发现人的存在，去重新认识人的价值，去重新寻找人在时空纵横交错的坐标系中应有的位置，去重新探究人的超越欲望与难以超越的局限。诗从历史暂时性走向哲理永恒性，意味着那种简单地解释生活现象的诗受到厌弃。因此，诗疏离于政治阐释的趋势是不可阻拦的，非意识形态化的趋势是不可阻拦的。这便是当今诗坛看似无序实而有序的内在流势。
    诗像一切艺术样式一样不能脱离生活、不能脱离时代，但诗是以具体化的方式传导人的情绪，因此可以称之为情绪的舞蹈；诗是在情感的流动中释放生命的热能，因此可以称之为心灵的音乐。很难对诗进行严格的题材界定，为了表述的方便，我们常常按着诗人注视生活的视角，分为贴近社会生活的诗和切入内心感情的诗，当诗面对着宏阔而又精微的人的世界的时候，当诗渗透着文化意识和思辨精神的时候，两种走向殊途同归——像每一朵浪花都折射出七彩虹霓，即使是诗人性格的外化，也内在地含蓄地表现时代气韵价值取向和美学追求；像苍茫大海由千江万水所汇聚，即使是表现社会风貌，也闪灼着个性色彩和人性光辉。柯平的《诗人毛泽东》（《人民文学》１９８８年１２月号）与其说构思的新颖，莫如说是切入题旨的角度新颖，他描绘这位对中国历史与现实产生重大影响的政治家的精神风貌，自然无法躲避政治，但柯平却把毛泽东做为历史铸造的人来理解：他的诗人气质蕴含着中国文化的积沉，他的诗人气质也直接或间接地潜引着一段历史的航向。邵燕祥的叙事长诗《最后的独白》（《中国诗人》创刊号），是写斯大林的妻子娜捷日达·阿利卢耶娃自杀之前的内心独白，从一个特殊的角度让我们窥见另一位政治家的性格和灵魂。邵燕祥和柯平一样都表现了世界与人存在的辩证规律：有什么样的历史，就会铸造什么样的人；有什么样人，就会铸造什么样的历史。
    本来，军旅诗应该是最富有政治色彩的，因为战争便是流血的政治。但是，诗却不该是政治形象化的解说词。我们欣喜地看到军旅创作近年有了明显的拓展，爱国主义与奉献精神仍然是它的宏大主题，然而已经不是来自对一种程式观念的不假思索的笃信，而是来自对人生价值的成熟的思考。在诗人们多维的思想空间里，人站立在中心位置，在重新认识人的本质的时候才会重新认识生命的意义，才会发现和表现新的价值判断和新的道德观念。贺东久的组诗《魔指》（《解放军文艺》１９８８年１１月号）以意象迭加的方式扩展了心理张力场，填充了丰富的哲理内涵。他正视一个严酷的事实：当死神降临以后，生命与理性同时凝固，“碑的高度与教堂的高度／成为静止”。历史暂时性将在时空永恒性里湮没，“被遗忘是黄土／和白骨的真正不幸”，但愿他们以生命的代价，换取理性的彻悟——“当共和国的旗帜飞腾起来／历史给今天／以清醒的基座”。诗人不再对生活表象进行逼真的描摹，而是透过表象去探究生命现象的真谛，把感知化为神奇而又准确的幻象。“魔指的感觉／是绝对的意象／聆听来自水底的钟声／欣赏一杯茶／渐浓　渐淡／时绿　时黄”。这种轻松感给人以前所未有的惊诧和近似严酷的警醒——在我们懂得了太多的历史必然性之后，诗人开启了生命世界之门，让我们窥见了一个或隐或现的生命现象：遮天盖地的战争风云往往发端于人的神经末梢。必然寓于偶然，任何个别都是一般。人欲不灭战争不绝，和平不会在天真的祈望中到来。刘世新的《墓碑宣言》（《星星》１９８８年４月号）是一篇悲壮的战争史话，牺牲者以墓碑为依托，人在被遗忘的孤独与悲凄之中有一种理性的升华，开始正视走进战争怪圈的人同战争一起，都成为“历史与现实相矛盾的主题”，而且是一个难以求解的“人类自身的秘密”。诗人的思索已经透过生存与死亡的活剧试图破译人类文化的斯芬克斯之谜。军旅诗的创作仅仅从一个独特的角度，展示了当今诗歌的内在流势：那种简单地解释题旨的表现方式面临着挑战，诗的缪斯在历史与现实、物质与精神、主观与客观相融合的更为广阔的天宇飞翔。
    我们不能不看到，生命意识的觉醒如同复活的精灵，给诗以新的活力。这是时代给予人的契机，又是从人的灵魂深处折映出的富有本质性的时代特征。人们复活了超越自我的欲望并认识难以超越的局限，于是诗便在矛盾的永恒性与不矛盾的暂时性里穿行，在主观与客观相统一又不统一相和谐又不和谐的冲撞里击溅出火花，构成人性的外烁。张俊兰的《绵绵不尽的长廊》（《天津文学》１９８８年５月号）把希望与失望并存的痛苦，把寻求解脱难以解脱的困境，把永不断绝的人生希冀和时时破灭的人生理想所酿成的人类悲剧化为诗情，像起伏跌宕的生命之河，时而舒缓时而湍急地流淌。当一切都破灭之后，在告别人世之前，仍希望人们能把话“说得圆满些，让我带走一个完美的童话／尽管是谎言也要尽量说得圆满。”生命，的确犹如不尽的走廊，选择与被选择都可以认识而难以把握，这种难以超越的人类局限，在东方文化心理的烛照之下，笼罩着一层凄切而又温馨的光环。于是我们看到了在悲伤极至的时刻，“是忌日哀悼”，“是生日狂欢”，“是无期徒刑”，“是胜利花环”。刘湛秋以《纯与不纯的抒情诗》为总标题写了大量抒情短章，是生命之光的释放，是他性格的外化，又表现了获得自主意识的人的觉醒。无数的鲜活的意象都是跳动着脉搏流动着血液的生命的化身，同时又有着时代与文化的印痕。他也有忧思，那往往是源于对一代人心理局限的不满，意识形态和传统道德给人的心灵以重压乃至使人异化，两个互相吸引的生命“像两只船，相靠而又分离／漫步，漫步，漫步就是目的／讨厌冬天，却又害怕酷夏／找不到一个人生的季节”（《星星》１９８８年５月号）。以上例举只是挂一漏万，意在说明当前诗歌创作绝非用“不景气”所能概括，相反，诗在新的文化背景之下正苦苦孕育悄悄拓展。
    当然，对当前创作态势持轻松的乐观态度，会失之盲目或失之思维轻浅。诗歌观念的两极分野，把诗引向两种异端：前者认为诗不能脱离政治，必须从政治视角看社会看人生，把有无忧患意识看作有无时代责任感的唯一标准，把能否引起社会反响视为衡量诗歌价值的唯一标尺，这样便无视了诗作为精英文化的基本品格，把诗降低到像民谣一样，只能真实地宣泄感情而缺乏深邃的美学内涵，或是把诗单一地视为社会工具而否定了它同样可以是个人工具和生命形式。后者则表现为从一种观念的狭窄走向了另一种狭窄的观念，把诗学推入纯粹幻境的曲折的小巷而陷入玄学的迷阵。“为赋新词强说愁”成为一种风气，成为一种时髦：一讲生命意识，就一定是人的孤独、人的扭曲、人的压抑、人的伸张；一讲人的自觉，就是自我暴露自我虐待自我否定自我扩张；一讲深层感觉，就是苦感性感陌生感荒诞感。于是，相互摹仿东施效颦，有的诗平白如水毫无情韵，有的诗艰涩虚玄故做深奥。这两种倾向都是诗歌发展的隐患。
