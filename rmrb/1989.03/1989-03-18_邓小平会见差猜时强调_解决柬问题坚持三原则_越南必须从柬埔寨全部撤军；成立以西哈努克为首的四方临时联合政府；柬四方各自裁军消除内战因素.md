Central Military Commission Chairman Deng Xiaoping emphasized: "The Cambodian issue must be resolved cleanly, and we must not let it become like the situation in Afghanistan. On the Cambodian issue, we insist on three principles: First, the Cambodian issue should be politically resolved, and the precondition is that Vietnam must truly withdraw all its troops from Cambodia; second, the government in power in Cambodia should be a four-party interim coalition government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, and this should be guaranteed by the international community; third, the political resolution of the Cambodian issue must eliminate the factors of civil war. China advocates that the four parties in Cambodia should each reduce their military forces." This was what Deng Xiaoping said this morning when he met with Prime Minister Chatchai in the Great Hall of the People.

He also said, "The Cambodian issue is very complex. The essence of this issue is Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia. This is a major principle. We want to resolve the Cambodian issue, but we cannot help the invaders. The primary issue is that Vietnam must withdraw its troops from Cambodia. By withdrawal, we mean that all armed forces composed of Vietnamese must withdraw from Cambodia, including the tens of thousands of Vietnamese hidden in the Khmer Rouge-Hun Sen army and the Vietnamese hidden in the Cambodian militia in the form of immigrants. If these Vietnamese do not withdraw from Cambodia, it will bury the factors of civil war. At the same time, a four-party interim coalition government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk must be established. Now, Vietnam is being arrogant. Whether Vietnam's words are credible depends on their actions. China and Thailand have cooperated very well on the Cambodian issue, and we hope this can continue."

Dressed in a gray Zhongshan suit, Deng Xiaoping was in high spirits, expressing special welcome and thanks to Prime Minister Chatchai for visiting China. He recounted the scenes of the three previous meetings with Chatchai and recalled, "In 1978, when I visited Thailand, I received a warm welcome and I am very grateful. Your wife is not present today, but I have heard your wife's beautiful singing." At this, the meeting hall resonated with laughter. "In Southeast Asia, China's best friend is Thailand. The potential for Sino-Thai cooperation is enormous." Deng Xiaoping continued, "It should be said that all ASEAN countries have good relations with us." He praised President Suharto's decision to restore relations between Indonesia and China and said that the normalization of relations between China and Indonesia would help China and ASEAN countries further develop friendly and cooperative relations.

Prime Minister Chatchai expressed his thanks for the meeting with Deng Xiaoping. He said, "The Thai people still remember Chairman Deng's participation in the shaving ceremony of the Thai crown prince during his visit to Thailand in 1978, and he was very satisfied and happy. Because Sino-Thai relations are very close, after I became prime minister, I decided to visit China first. Although Sino-Thai relations are very close, the two countries have different social systems, but we can develop close and friendly relations." He also expressed his complete agreement with Chairman Deng's three principles for resolving the Cambodian issue.

The entire meeting lasted 1 hour and 40 minutes, far exceeding the scheduled time.

	17th morning, Central Military Commission Chairman Deng Xiaoping and Prime Minister Chatchai had a 100-minute cordial conversation in the Fujian Hall of the Great Hall of the People, and they showed no signs of fatigue, smiling brightly as they walked to a screen by the entrance of the hall. Prime Minister Chatchai happily said, "This is a good place for a photo," and Chairman Deng nodded repeatedly. Then, the two leaders shook hands tightly for a long time as they bid farewell.

　　邓小平会见差猜时强调
    解决柬问题坚持三原则
    越南必须从柬埔寨全部撤军；成立以西哈努克为首的四方临时联合政府；柬四方各自裁军消除内战因素
    本报北京３月１７日讯  记者温宪报道：中央军委主席邓小平强调说：“柬埔寨问题要干净地解决，不要出现像阿富汗那样的形势。在柬埔寨问题上，我们坚持三项原则：第一，柬埔寨问题应当政治解决，其前提是越南必须真正地从柬埔寨撤出其全部军队；第二，在柬埔寨当权的应该是以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，并且由国际保证；第三，政治解决柬埔寨问题必须消除柬埔寨内战的因素。中国主张柬埔寨四方的军队各自减少。”这是邓小平今天上午在人民大会堂会见差猜总理时讲的。
    他还说，柬埔寨问题非常复杂。这一问题的实质是越南侵略柬埔寨。这是个大的原则问题。我们要解决柬埔寨问题，但不能帮助侵略者。首要的问题是越南必须从柬埔寨撤军。所谓撤军，是指所有由越南人组成的武装力量都要从柬埔寨撤出去，包括埋伏在韩桑林—洪森军队中的几万越南人和用移民方式埋伏在柬埔寨民兵中的越南人。这些越南人不撤出柬埔寨，就埋伏了打内战的因素。同时，要成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。现在，越南在翘尾巴。越南的话是否可信，要看行动。中泰两国在柬埔寨问题上合作得很好，希望能继续下去。
    身着灰色中山装的邓小平兴致勃勃，表示特别欢迎和感谢差猜总理访华。他历数了过去三次会见差猜总理的情景，还回忆说：“１９７８年我访问泰国时，受到了盛情接待，很感谢。你夫人今天没有在座，我曾听过你夫人美丽的歌声。”这时，会见大厅内顿时荡起一片欢笑。“在东南亚，中国最好的朋友是泰国。中泰合作的潜力大得很。”邓小平接着说，“应该说东盟各国和我们都有良好的关系。”他赞扬了苏哈托总统决定恢复印尼和中国的关系，并说中国、印尼关系正常化的实现将有助于中国和东盟国家进一步发展友好合作关系。
    差猜总理对邓小平的会见表示感谢。他说：“泰国人民仍然记得邓主席１９７８年访泰时参加了泰王储的剃度仪式，并对此表示非常满意和高兴。由于泰中关系很密切，我担任总理后就要首先访问中国。泰中两国虽然社会制度不同，但可以发展密切、友好的关系。”他还表示完全同意邓主席所阐述的解决柬埔寨问题的三项原则。
    整个会见持续了１小时４０分钟，大大超出了预定的时间。

    １７日上午，中央军委主席邓小平和差猜总理在人民大会堂福建厅经过了１００分钟的亲切交谈之后，毫无倦意，满面春风地走到大厅门口一幅屏风前。差猜总理高兴地说：“这里是照相的好地方”，邓小平主席连连点头。接着，两位领导人长时间地紧紧握着双手告别。
