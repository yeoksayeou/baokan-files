Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 4th.

The Bush administration has approved an agreement to jointly develop and produce a new type of F-16 fighter jet with Japan. This agreement includes the transfer of the latest aerospace technology from the U.S. to Japan, aiming to help Japan modernize its air force by the end of the 1990s.

However, many members of Congress have opposed this agreement. They believe that Japan should purchase American jet fighters to help reduce the $50 billion trade deficit.

Some members of Congress have also written to President Bush, expressing their intention to oppose the $7 billion joint project when it is discussed in Congress.

An unnamed member of Congress said that the government will formally present this technology transfer agreement to Congress on March 13.

　　布什政府批准
    美日合作生产新型战斗机
    为减少美日贸易赤字许多议员反对
    新华社华盛顿３月４日电  据美国国会议员今天证实，布什政府已批准一项同日本合作研制和生产Ｆ—１６新型战斗机的协议。
    这项协议包括美国将向日本转让最新航天技术，帮助日本在９０年代末期实现空军现代化。
    但是，此项协议遭到许多国会议员的反对。他们认为，日本应当购买美国的喷气式战斗机，以便减少５００亿美元贸易赤字。
    一些国会议员还写信给布什总统，表示要在国会讨论该项协议时反对这一耗资７０亿美元的合作计划。
    一位不愿披露姓名的国会议员说，政府将在３月１３日向国会正式提出这项技术转让协议。
