Opening Remarks

From the Year of the Dragon to the Year of the Snake, transportation has been a major concern for the Chinese people: buying tickets is difficult, traveling is difficult, shipping goods is difficult, and with various traffic accidents, people cannot help but worry: the so-called "pioneer" of national economic development, what is really going on?

To answer this question, it is not something that can be done with a few words, nor can it be explained by a few articles from a single department. Moreover, to truly solve the transportation issues in our country today, it is not only necessary for the transportation department to work hard, but also for various levels of decision-making departments to understand, and for the broad masses of the people to understand and support. In short, it requires collective wisdom and joint efforts. For this reason, we have decided to launch a broad discussion on transportation issues. The theme is: How can we quickly change the severely backward situation of transportation in our country?

Transportation connects production, circulation, and consumption, linking all parts of the country, involving thousands of households, and affecting all industries. It plays an important role in implementing the adjustment policy. Therefore, our discussion is open to the entire society, and we welcome people from all walks of life to participate. Leaders can talk about their ideas and methods; experts and scholars can explain their views; colleagues from the transportation department can share their difficulties and thoughts; ordinary people can also comment based on their personal experiences.

In short, since it is a discussion, there is no need to be confined to one format. We welcome everyone to express their opinions in various forms with the spirit of speaking without reservation. Criticisms, suggestions, and strategies can all be published, whether macro or micro, without any restrictions. We also welcome debates with different opinions. Regardless of the author's occupation or position, all will be treated as "one person's opinion."

The discussion will start with railways and then expand to roads, waterways, civil aviation, pipelines, and urban public transportation.

The article "Railways are Struggling and Calling Out" is long because it aims to introduce the situation of railway transportation to the readers. Due to space limitations, we hope that in the following discussions, each article should not exceed 1,500 words.

We look forward to receiving your contributions. Please send your articles to the Economic Department of the People's Daily (marked "Transportation Discussion").

### 开场白

　　开场白
    从龙年到蛇年，交通运输一直是国人关注的热点之一：买票难、乘车难、运货难，再加上各种交通事故，人们不禁要焦心地问：号称发展国民经济的“先行官”，究竟是怎么回事？
    要回答这个问题，决不是一两句话能办到的，也不是某个部门一两篇文章可以说清的。而且，时至今日，真正要解决我国交通方面的问题，不仅需要交通运输部门的努力，还需要各级决策部门的“明白”，广大群众的理解和支持。总之，要靠集思广益，群策群力。为此，我们决定开展一次交通运输问题的广泛讨论。主题是：如何尽快改变我国交通运输严重滞后的局面？
    交通运输联结生产、流通、消费，沟通全国各地，涉及千家万户，影响各行各业，在贯彻调整方针中居于重要地位。因此我们这个讨论是面向全社会的，欢迎各界人士都来参加讨论。领导干部可以谈谈自己的构思和办法；专家、学者可以阐明自己的观点；交通运输部门的同志可以亮一亮自己的困难和想法；普通群众也可以从自己的切身感受出发，评论一番。
    总之，既然是讨论，就不必囿于一格。我们欢迎大家本着知无不言的精神以各种形式发表自己的意见，批评、建议、对策均可发表，宏观、微观不拘一格，也欢迎不同意见的争论。不论作者干何职业，职位高低，一律都视为是“一家之言”。
    讨论将首先从铁路开始，然后扩展到公路、水运、民航、管道及城市公共交通等方面。
    《铁路在拚搏中呼喊》文字长了，为的是向读者介绍铁路运输的情况。因篇幅有限，在以后讨论中，希望每篇来稿最长不要超过一千五百字。
    我们期待着大家的来稿。来稿请寄人民日报经济部工交组。（注明交通讨论稿）
