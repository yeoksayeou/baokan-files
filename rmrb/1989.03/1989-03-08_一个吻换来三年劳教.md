A Kiss in Exchange for Three Years of Re-education Through Labor

On December 8, 1988, a pair of shiny handcuffs locked around the hands of Wang Jianqing, a young man from a certain unit in Jiuquan, Gansu. A kiss in exchange for three years of re-education through labor—this was something he had never imagined.

One summer day, Wang Jianqing saw a book titled "Rose Dream" on the street. He had heard that this was a book banned by the state. Curiosity drove him to buy it for 10 yuan. That night, he lay in bed, eagerly reading it with a flashlight. The obscene language in the book made him lose his mind.

On the evening of November 29, around 9 PM, Wang Jianqing saw a young woman walking towards him on the street and suddenly had impure thoughts. He grabbed the young woman's wrist and forcefully kissed her, making lewd gestures. The young woman struggled desperately, and the two of them tussled together. She shouted, "Help! Catch the hooligan!" At that moment, a couple heard the commotion and rushed over. Wang Jianqing did not have time to pick up his hat that had fallen to the ground and fled in a panic. The Nanmen Police Station in Jiuquan, based on the clues provided by the hat, found the culprit in less than half an hour. Wang Jianqing was finally sentenced to three years of re-education through labor.

　　一个吻换来三年劳教
    本报讯１９８８年１２月８日，一副铮亮手铐锁住了甘肃酒泉市某单位青年王建青的双手。一个吻换来三年劳教，这是他原来不曾想过的。
    夏日的一天，王建青从街上看到一本名为《玫瑰梦》的书。他听人说，这是国家禁止出版发行的一部书。一种好奇心驱使他花１０元钱买了下来。当晚，他躺在被窝里，迫不及待地打着手电筒偷看，书中那些淫秽的语言使他神魂颠倒。
    １１月２９日晚２１时左右，王建青在街上见到一女青年迎面走来，顿生邪念。他一把抓住女青年的手腕，用力抱住她肆意接吻，耍流氓动作。女青年拚命反抗，同王建青撕扯在一起，大喊：“快来人哪，抓流氓！”恰在这时，一对男女闻声赶来。王建青顾不得去拣掉在地上的帽子，仓皇逃走。酒泉市南关派出所根据这顶帽子提供的线索，不到半个小时就查出了案犯。王建青终于被劳教三年。
