		Dropping out to start a business: hope or concern?

		Zhao Aijing

		An unexpected event occurred without any mental preparation from my parents. During the winter vacation, my younger brother suddenly announced to my parents: he wanted to drop out of school and return to his hometown to start a stone materials factory. My brother, who was about to secure an "iron rice bowl" after just one more semester, made this decision, which was like a blow to the head for my parents, who were already in their sixties. My mother was first stunned into silence, then she began to plead and scold him with tears. My brother, who was scolded to the point of frustration, retorted, "You might as well consider the past three and a half years as wasted, and just let it go." My father was so angry that he couldn't speak, just sitting there smoking in silence. Seeing that she couldn't change his mind, my mother then called me in to try to persuade him.

		However, my thoughts were also full of contradictions. On one hand, I admired my brother's courage to start a business and explore a new life. On the other hand, I felt a sense of regret and pity for his decision. I didn't expect that my brother's thoughts would change so quickly. He entered Beijing Iron and Steel Institute from a county town in September 1985. At that time, his thoughts were as pure as the blue sky, and he was passionate about double degrees, graduate studies, and studying abroad... How did his thoughts change so much in such a short time?!

		That night, I planned to have a talk with my brother. But before I could "soften his heart," he took the initiative and said, "Brother, you've only worked for a few years, how did your thoughts become so conservative? You remember, right? In 'The Third Wave,' it says: people can only truly realize themselves by finding the best choice. Right now, the power plant being built in our hometown is a key project in the national 'Eighth Five-Year Plan,' with an investment of several hundred million yuan! Once construction begins, how many bricks, cement, and stone materials will be needed, but what our hometown lacks the most is the construction industry. I've studied enterprise management in school, and if I go back to my hometown to start a stone materials factory, it will benefit both the country and myself. As the saying goes, time waits for no one. Why not do what I've decided on quickly, instead of waiting to get that diploma? Does having a diploma mean having real skills?"

		My younger brother spoke passionately. But I felt that he was making starting a business too easy. For example: how to acquire land? Where to build the factory? Where will the funds come from? Technical strength? Workers' meals and accommodation? Upstream and downstream channels... Had he considered all these questions? Moreover, had he thought about the various worries that might come after giving up the "iron rice bowl"?... I listed these questions for him in the tone of someone who had been through it, urging him to think carefully. But my brother answered all my questions fluently. It seemed he had been planning this for a long time. He sincerely told me, "Brother, it seems you still don't understand me. My personality is to face death and then live. Some people think this is a risk, but I think it's a driving force for starting a business. Everyone has their own aspirations. Why should the younger generation have to follow the path already paved by the older generation, instead of blazing a new trail forward?"

		I find it difficult to simply judge my brother's choice as right or wrong. The reform tide has brought such unrest and turmoil to the once peaceful campus. Is this a hope or a concern for our nation? I'm not sure, but I really want to find the answer.

　　弃学办实业希望？忧虑？
    赵爱晶
    父母一点精神准备都没有的事发生了。弟弟寒假回来，突然向父母摊牌：他要中途辍学，回家乡办石料厂。眼看只剩一学期就要端上“铁饭碗”的弟弟，突然做出这一抉择，对于年龄已６０开外的双亲来说，无异当头一棒！母亲先是痴呆呆地傻了半晌，继而便一把鼻涕一把泪地规劝、数落。不料，被数落急了的弟弟，又没深没浅地嘣出一句：“你们权当我这三年半是白过了，不就想开了？”父亲越发气得说不出话来了，望着身高马大的儿子，打又打不得，只好坐在那抽闷烟。母亲见自己“回天无术”，又“搬”我上阵。
    然而，我的思想也充满了矛盾。一方面，打心眼儿里佩服弟弟这种勇于创业和拓展新生活的勇气。另一方面，却又隐隐为弟弟的这一抉择惋惜和遗憾。我没想到，弟弟的思想“滑坡”得竟这般快。他是１９８５年９月才从县城考入北京钢铁学院的。那时，他的思想纯洁得就像蔚蓝蔚蓝的天，他钟情的是双学位、研究生和出国深造……曾几何时，他的思想竟出现了这样大的落差？！
    那晚，我打算和弟弟谈一谈。谁知，弟弟还没待我“温火攻心”，倒先发制人了，他说：“哥，你才工作了几年？思想怎么就变得这样迂腐守旧。你还记得吧？《第三次浪潮》中讲：人，只有找到最佳选择，才能真正实现自我。眼下在咱们家乡上马的电厂，是国家‘八五’计划的重点项目，仅投资就几千万元呢！一破土动工，需要多少砖、灰、石、料，可咱们家乡最缺少的就是建筑产业。我在学校学过企业管理，回家乡办个石料厂，于国于己都有利。常言道，时不我待。为什么这认准了的事不快去干，非要让我等着去领那张文凭纸？难道有了文凭就等于有了真才实学？”
    六弟语调激昂。我却觉得，他把创业看得太容易了。比如：如何征地？在哪建厂？资金从何而来？技术力量？工人吃宿？上下渠道……这些他都考虑好了吗？还有，他是否想过扔了“铁饭碗”以后可能给他带来的种种后顾之忧？……我以一个过来者的口气，把这一个个问题给他摆出来，促他三思。谁知，弟弟对我所提的问题，对答如流。看来他是“蓄谋已久”了，他恳切地对我直言道：“哥，看来你还是不了解我。我的个性就喜欢置之死地而后生。有人认为这是一种风险，我却认为是一种创业的动力。人各有志。为什么后一辈就非得在老一辈已经踏平的路上走，而不是自己开辟一条新路前进呢？”
    对弟弟的这一抉择，我很难简单地用错和对来判断。改革的大潮给昔日宁静的校园里掀起的这种躁动和不平静，究竟是我们民族的一种希望？还是一种忧虑？我说不清楚，但又很想得到答案。
