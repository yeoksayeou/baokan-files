Title: Why Be So Keen on Making "Directories"?

Recently, some people have shown interest in compiling directories. There are directories for engineers, editors, a national compilation of newspapers and periodicals, and a directory of senior-level intellectuals... the list goes on. How many of these directories are actually of practical use is questionable. Moreover, it is even more puzzling that those who compile national directories are not departments or units that have control over or are familiar with national circumstances, but rather scattered units across various regions, some of which are even "obscure." Therefore, it is even more questionable whether these units can compile national directories well.

In the world today, there are countries that compile directories, but generally, these are directories of notable figures, either national or international. Some of China's notable figures have also been included in world directories of notable people. However, the kind of "national directories" that include everyone in a particular profession, as mentioned earlier, seem more like "professional household registries" and appear to have little use.

Yet, these pointless activities have sparked the interest of so many people, whose primary focus is simply on making money. An editor friend told me: Not long ago, he received a letter and form from a unit in a certain place that was compiling a national directory of editors. The letter stated that as long as one fills out the form, attaches a photo, and remits 80 yuan, one can be included in the "editor directory." He said, "This is a trick to deceive people. If they can really get tens of thousands of editors across the country to be included in this directory, they could make a small fortune. However, I think there won't be many people who fall for it."

Currently, some people are keen on compiling directories, indeed treating it as a means of making money. Just consider the "editor directory" for example, 80 yuan per person. If several thousand editors across the country are included in this directory, they would become millionaires. However, the significance of such a directory, which simply records whatever the individual fills in, is self-evident. Who would need to frequently refer to such a directory with no practical value?

### 何必热衷搞“名录”！

　　何必热衷搞“名录”！
    池文
    近来，有些人对编纂名录感到兴趣，工程师名录、编辑名录、全国报刊总汇、高级职称知识分子名录……不一而足。这些名录，其中究竟有多少是有实用价值的，恐怕令人怀疑。而且，更令人奇怪的是，这些搞全国性名录的，都不是掌握和熟悉全国有关情况的部门和单位，而是分散在各地的有的甚至是“名不见经传”的单位，因而更令人怀疑，由他们中的某些人来搞全国性的名录，能搞得好吗？
    当今世界上搞名录的国家是有的，但一般都是搞名人录，或全国性的，或世界性的，我国有些著名人士也有收进世界名人录的。但像上面所说的各系统各行业只要是这一专业的就都囊括在内的“全国名录”，却有点像“专业户口册”，似无多大用处。
    无益之事却激发了那么多人的兴趣，他们的着眼点无非是一个“钱”字。一位编辑朋友告诉笔者：前不久他收到某地一家搞全国编辑名录的单位的来函和表格，说是只要登记好表格，附上照片，并且汇上八十元钱，就可以上这本“编辑名录”。他说：“这是骗人的把戏，他们真要是能把全国成千上万的编辑都拉到这名录上来，倒是可以发一笔不小的横财。不过，我想上当的不会多。”
    现在有些人热衷于搞名录，确实是将此视作生财之道的。请想想，就以那“编辑名录”来说，一人八十元，如果全国有几千个编辑上了这名录，他们就是腰缠万贯的万元大户了。可这种根据本人随意填写的内容照登一番的名录，究竟有多大的意义，是可想而知的。有谁需要经常去翻这种没有实用价值的名录呢！
