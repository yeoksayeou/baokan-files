The U.S. Senate held a full session today to formally debate the nomination of Thor to serve as Secretary of Defense. The debate between opposing sides was intense.

Democratic Senator and Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Nunn stated in the debate that Thor's "problem of excessive drinking" cannot be ignored, as the Secretary of Defense, second only to the President in the nuclear command position, is different from the Secretary of the Interior. Republican Senator and key member of the Armed Services Committee Warner said that Thor has made "countless contributions" in the Senate over 24 years, and the 70 senators who have worked with him do not deny his diligent performance.

A few days ago (February 26), Thor, to dispel doubts about his drinking, promised in a televised speech that he would not touch alcohol while serving as Secretary of Defense, and if he broke his word, he would immediately resign.

The full session will continue the debate.

　　托尔能否担任国防部长？
    美参院开始激烈辩论
    本报华盛顿３月２日电  记者张启昕报道：美国参议院今天举行全体会议，就提名托尔担任国防部长之职开始正式辩论。意见不同的双方争论激烈。
    民主党参议员、参院军委会主席纳恩在辩论中说，不能忽视托尔“用酒过量的问题”，因国防部长不同于内政部长，居于仅次于总统的核指挥岗位上。共和党参议员、军委会主要成员华纳尔说，托尔在参院２４年里作出“无数贡献”，与他共事过的７０位参议员，谁也不否认他的尽职表现。
    几天前（２月２６日），托尔为消除对他饮酒的疑虑，在一次电视讲话中保证，在他担任国防部长职务时，决不沾酒，如果食言，立即辞职。
    全体会议将继续进行辩论。
