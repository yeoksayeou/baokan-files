The Soviet Union has declared that it is expelling an American diplomat for "using his diplomatic status to engage in prohibited activities." It has ordered U.S. Deputy Military Attaché Colonel Daniel Gantzer to leave the country within 48 hours.

According to a statement read today by Grigoriy Grashimov, head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's press department, the decision was conveyed to a counselor at the U.S. Embassy in the Soviet Union during a meeting with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Karpov on March 14. Gantzer was accused of attempting to enter a restricted area to photograph military targets.

Local observers believe that the Soviet Union's action is clearly a retaliation for the U.S. expulsion of the assistant military attaché at the Soviet Embassy in the United States, Colonel Yuri Pakhtusov, a week earlier.

It is noteworthy that the new U.S. administration has been in office for only a short time, and already the U.S. and the Soviet Union have begun expelling spies from each other's countries. Grashimov commented on this today, saying that some people in the United States are trying to sabotage Soviet-American relations.

　　苏联驱逐一名美国外交官
    新华社莫斯科３月１５日电  （记者竺承军）苏联以“利用外交身份从事违禁活动”为由，宣布美国驻苏使馆副武官丹尼兹尔·甘季中校为不受欢迎的人，并勒令他４８小时内离境。
    据苏联外交部新闻局局长格拉西莫夫今天宣读的一项声明说，上述决定是１４日苏联外交部副部长卡尔波夫召见美国驻苏使馆一名参赞时告知对方的。甘季的罪名是企图进入禁区拍摄军事目标。
    此间观察家认为，苏联此举显然是对美国一周前驱逐苏联驻美使馆助理武官尤里·帕赫图索夫中校行动的报复。
    美国新政府上台不久，苏美之间就开始互相驱逐间谍，这一点令人注目。格拉西莫夫今天对此发表评论认为，美国有一些人企图破坏苏美关系。
