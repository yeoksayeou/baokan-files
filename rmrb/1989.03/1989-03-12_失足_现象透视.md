In the midst of China's social transformation, the issue of youth "stumbling" and even committing crimes has become a serious social problem.

This is not an exaggeration. According to the "Annual Report on Juvenile Crime in China," from 1950 to 1959, juvenile crime accounted for about 20% of all criminal offenses; from 1959 to 1965, the proportion increased to 30%; during the "Cultural Revolution" decade, it rose to approximately 60%; in 1983, it surged to 60.2%; in 1985, it reached 71.42%; and in 1986, it peaked at 72.47%.

The causes of youth stumbling are multifaceted. Apart from personal weakness, lack of social experience, and being easily deceived, family structure defects and educational mistakes are significant factors. According to statistics from relevant departments in Hangzhou and Shanghai, out of 5,021 juvenile delinquents, 1,274 were influenced by unfavorable family factors, meaning that in every four cases of juvenile crime, one is related to the family. Parents' improper behavior or incorrect educational methods, such as overindulgence or physical punishment, are highly detrimental to a child's growth.

Under the influence of materialism and the new "education is useless" ideology, the number of dropouts and underachieving students has increased significantly, providing a constant supply of potential youth offenders. Dropouts are typically at a critical age for adolescent development; without proper guidance from society and school, an increase in crime rates is inevitable. Recently, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau apprehended a car thief named Wang Wei, who, at just 17 years old, stole 105 cars alone in two to three years after dropping out of school in April 1986.

Social influences are also significant. Currently, the three major social evils—gambling, pornography, and illegal publications—are catalysts for corrupting youth.

According to statistics, in 1987, public security agencies nationwide handled tens of thousands of gambling cases and punished tens of thousands of gamblers. Some weak-willed youth fall into the gambling trap after watching and learning to gamble. On April 2, 1986, a high school student in Shanghai hacked his parents to death with an axe because he had lost money gambling and his parents refused to give him more.

Pornography is a silent killer. According to statistics from relevant departments in Guizhou Province, out of over 1,100 commercial video playback points, 1/5 have been found to have played obscene videos. In 86 counties (cities, districts) across the province, 73 have been infiltrated by obscene videos, accounting for 85% of the total. According to incomplete statistics from the Tongren region, in just half a year, 1,286 obscene video screenings were seized, with 227,500 viewers, of whom over 90% were youth. Some youth engage in hooliganism while watching obscene videos. Last October, while passing through Shishi Town in Fujian Province, the author witnessed a "porn market" that lived up to its name, with obscene playing cards and videos everywhere. The sellers openly boasted, "We sell suits, playing cards, and videos, all genuine Hong Kong goods!"

Illegal publications have an even greater impact on youth. According to partial statistics from relevant national departments, in recent years, various regions have discovered 1,372 illegal books and magazines. If each is circulated at 50,000 copies, the total would be 68.6 million. Due to youth's lack of discernment, these publications have a particularly negative impact on them. Some start their downward spiral after reading just one or two bad books.

The state has long had regulations prohibiting gambling, pornographic materials, and illegal publications. The current problem is primarily the lax enforcement of these laws. It seems that decisively shutting down "porn markets" is urgently needed to save those who have stumbled and warn those who are lost. Additionally, efforts must be made to build more youth activity venues to correctly guide youth in developing their talents, enriching their interests and hobbies, and filling their lives with healthy spiritual pursuits. Only when the entire society cares for youth will there be more who succeed and fewer who stumble!

　　“失足”现象透视
    周伟新
    在我国的社会变革中，青少年“失足”以至犯罪，已经成为一个严重的社会问题。
    这不是危言耸听。据《中国青少年犯罪研究年鉴》统计，１９５０—１９５９年间，青少年犯罪占整个刑事犯罪的２０％左右；１９５９—１９６５年，比例为３０％；“文革”十年期间约为６０％；１９８３年上升为６０．２％；１９８５年为７１．４２％；１９８６年则达到７２．４７％。
    导致青少年失足的原因是多元的。除了自身意志薄弱、社会经验甚少、受骗上当以外，家庭结构缺陷，家庭教育失误是一大原因。据杭州、上海有关部门统计，５０２１名违法犯罪青少年中，由家庭的不利因素导致犯罪的有１２７４名，四起青少年犯罪案件中就有一起与家庭有关。父母的行为不检点，或者采取溺爱、打骂等不正确的教育方法，对孩子的成长十分不利。
    在拜金主义、新的“读书无用论”的冲击下，学校流失生、双差生大量增加，为失足青年提供源源不断的预备队。流失生年龄一般处于青少年成长的关键期年龄段；离开了社会和学校的正确教育引导，犯罪率上升是很自然的。最近，上海市公安局查获了一窃车犯王维，年仅１７岁，自１９８６年４月辍学后，竟在二三年内单独偷车１０５辆。
    社会的影响也是不可忽视的。当前社会上的三大浊流——赌博、黄色污染、非法出版物，成为毒害青少年的催化剂。
    据统计，１９８７年，全国公安机关共查处赌博案件数十万起，处罚赌徒数十万人。一些意志薄弱的青少年，就是由看赌、学赌继而陷进赌博浊流的。１９８６年４月２日，上海市一名在校高中生，手持利斧，将亲生父母活活劈死，其直接动因就是赌博输了钱，而父母不给。
    黄色污染是杀人不见血的。据贵州省有关部门统计，在１１００多个营业性的录像播放点中，已查实播放过淫秽录像的占１／５。在全省８６个县（市、区）中，传入淫秽录像的有７３个，占总数的８５％。仅据铜仁地区的不完全统计，在半年时间内，就查获播放淫秽录像１２８６场，观众达２２７５００多人次，其中青少年占９０％以上。有的青年边看淫秽录像，边干流氓勾当。去年１０月笔者路过福建省石狮镇，那里的“黄货市场”真是名不虚传，淫秽扑克、录像带比比皆是。卖主也若无其事地张扬：“这里卖西装、扑克牌、录像带，正宗的港货！”
    非法出版物对青少年的冲击更大。据国家有关部门的部分统计，最近几年各地发现的非法书刊达１３７２种，若按每种发行５万册计算，总共就有６８６０万册。由于青少年缺乏较高的评判能力，这些读物对他们产生的“负效应”尤为显著。有的就是从看一两本坏书开始，走上堕落之路的。
    查禁赌博、淫秽物品和非法出版物，国家早有明令公布的法规。当前的问题主要是执法不严。看来，坚决取缔“黄货市场”已刻不容缓，这样才能挽救失足者，警醒迷途者。另外，还要加强青少年活动场所的建设，以正确地引导青少年发挥各自的特长，丰富他们的兴趣和爱好，充实他们健康的精神生活。只有全社会都来关心青少年，有为者才会越来越多，失足者才会越来越少！
