Three million female entrepreneurs are showcasing their achievements. According to incomplete statistics, China currently has nearly 30,000 female entrepreneurs. In Guangdong, where the commodity economy is developing rapidly, there are more than 7,000 female entrepreneurs.

On March 7, the "First National Female Entrepreneurs' Business Achievement Exhibition" opened at the China Revolutionary Museum in Beijing. The 185 enterprises participating in this exhibition come from 24 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, covering nearly 20 industries including light industry, pharmaceuticals, hardware, chemicals, electronics, and machinery. Among them, 9 enterprises are among China's top-tier enterprises with the highest management levels, and there are also several private enterprises and joint ventures with foreign capital. More than half of the products from these enterprises managed by female entrepreneurs have won international gold awards, national quality awards, provincial and ministerial quality awards. The exhibition features female entrepreneurs from Qingdao and Guangzhou, who are particularly eye-catching.

Female entrepreneurs are hailed as the "most charming women" in today's China. This is because they possess high-quality skills and are engaged in competitive, risky, and creative businesses, showcasing the new image of women in the development of the commodity economy. It is reported that 17 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have established female entrepreneurs' associations or friendship associations. A survey by the Women's Federation of Jilin Province shows that in the province's state-owned and collective enterprises, more than 1,700 women hold the positions of factory director or manager. Among the 388,000 individual and joint-venture enterprises in the province, more than half are managed by women. In Putian City, Fujian Province alone, more than 2,100 enterprises are run by women. Township enterprises have provided a new stage for women to display their talents. In Jiangsu Province, there are more than 1,700 female factory directors and managers in the township enterprises of 11 cities and 41 counties.

　　三万女企业家大展风采
    本报讯  记者冯媛报道：据不完全统计，我国目前女企业家已近３万。在商品经济率先发展的广东，女企业家就逾７０００名。
    ３月７日，“全国首届女企业家经营成果博览会”在北京中国革命博物馆开幕。参加这次博览会的１８５家企业来自全国２４个省、市、自治区，包括轻工、医药、五金、化工、电子、机械等近２０个行业，其中有９个企业属于我国目前经营管理水平最高的企业——二级企业，也有数家私营企业和中外合资企业。这些由女企业家经营管理的企业中，半数以上的产品荣膺国际金奖、国优和省优、部优。博览会上，青岛和广州的女企业家群格外引人注目。
    女企业家被誉为当今中国“最有魅力的女性”，这是因为她们具备较高的素质，又从事着充满竞争、风险、创造的事业，在商品经济发展中已初展新女性的风采。据介绍，全国已有１７个省、市、自治区成立了女企业家协会或联谊会。吉林省妇联的一项调查表明，该省的国营、集体企业中，有１７００余名女性担任了正副厂长（经理），全省３８．８万个个体户办、联户办企业中，也有一半以上由女性经营管理。福建省仅莆田市就有２１００余家企业由女性负责。乡镇企业为女性施展才能提供了新天地。江苏省１１个市、４１个县的乡镇企业中，就有女厂长经理１７００多名。
