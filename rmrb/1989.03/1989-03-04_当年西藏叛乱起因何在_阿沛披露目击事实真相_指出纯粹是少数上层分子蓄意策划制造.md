The cause of the "armed rebellion" that occurred in Tibet in 1959 has been a subject of speculation. A widely circulated rumor abroad claims that the uprising was triggered because the Tibetan Military Region intended to put the Dalai Lama and key officials of the then Tibetan local government, the Kashag, on a plane to be sent to the interior. A witness to these events, Alphé Alphé, currently a Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, recently revealed the true facts to a reporter from "China Tibet."

The Curtain Rises on the Rebellion

Alphé Alphé said: On the morning of March 10, 1959, the streets of Lhasa were in chaos. People were crying and running around, shouting, "Go to Norbulingka to protect the precious jewel! The Han people are going to kidnap him!" The precious jewel is a reverent term used by Tibetans for the Dalai Lama. Thus, with hearts filled with shock, confusion, and fear, people rushed to Norbulingka, using the protection of the Dalai Lama as a pretext, and surrounded Norbulingka, marking the beginning of the "armed rebellion."

The Dalai Lama Wants to Watch a Performance

This vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee of Tibetan ethnicity introduced: "After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, every year during the 'breaking of the ninth month,' the Tibetan Work Committee and the Tibetan Military Region's leaders were invited to watch the 'Cham dance.' In 1959, the year of the Earth Pig according to the Tibetan calendar, only the political commissar of the Tibetan Military Region, Tan Guan San, and the deputy commander, Deng Shao Dong, were invited to the Potala Palace. When the Dalai Lama met with the two military leaders, he voluntarily expressed his wish to watch the new performance by the Tibetan Military Region's cultural troupe. Tan and Deng immediately agreed and arranged for the performance to be held at the military region's auditorium according to the Dalai Lama's request."

All the Kalons, or key officials of the then Tibetan local government, were aware of this process. Later, because the Dalai Lama had something to attend to, the time to go to the military region to watch the performance was delayed.

The Storm Breaks

On the afternoon of March 9, 1959, around 3 PM, an official from the United Front Department of the Tibetan Work Committee told Alphé that the Dalai Lama had decided to go to the military region to watch the cultural troupe's performance on March 10 and that the Kashag officials did not need to go to Norbulingka the next day; they could go directly to the military region's auditorium to wait for him. According to the usual procedure, for such activities, Kashag officials should first go to Norbulingka and then accompany the Dalai Lama. Alphé felt that the situation was abnormal and sensed that something was amiss.

The Deputy Commander of the Tibetan Military Region is Attacked

That evening, around 6 or 7 PM, Alphé received a call from the acting Kalon, Liu Xia, saying that all the Kalons should gather at Norbulingka at 9 AM on March 10 to discuss the arrangements and then go together. At that time, serving as the secretary-general of the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee, Alphé said: "On the morning of March 10, I did not go directly to Norbulingka but first went to the Preparatory Committee to lead a political study session and also waited for a call from Norbulingka to see what the situation was. Before 10 AM, the deputy commander of the Tibetan Military Region and the Kalon and commander-in-chief of the Tibetan local government's army, Sangpo Zainwang Rinzin, was injured by stones while on his way to Norbulingka. After 10 AM, the brother of Pabala Geleng Jie, Kangjin Solang Dainzi, was killed by rebels at the gate of Norbulingka. It was clear that the Dalai Lama could not go to the military region to watch the performance. We also could not go to Norbulingka. I then rushed from the Preparatory Committee to the military region." Alphé Alphé said: "This is the cause and the entire process of the 'March 10 Incident' in 1959."

How the Rumor Was Created

Some people abroad, when writing about this period of history, claim that the reason the Dalai Lama did not go to the military region to watch the performance was because the military region proposed that only personal staff and a few guards could be brought along, and other officials could not accompany him. Regarding this, Alphé Alphé said: "This is completely untrue."

He said that according to the usual procedure, at that time, the Dalai Lama, as the leader of Tibet and the chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Preparatory Committee, how could he not bring along accompanying officials and guards when going out to participate in activities? In fact, at that time, the Tibetan Military Region not only invited the Dalai Lama but also invited all the Kalons of the Kashag, the Dalai Lama's two tutors, and some high-ranking lamas and nobles. Alphé Alphé said: "The rebellion that occurred in Tibet in 1959 was entirely unjustified. It was not caused by the central government's policies or the central government itself but was instigated by a few upper-class elements. The reason for the emergence of statements that contradict the facts is that some people with ulterior motives created rumors, and even many officials of the original Tibetan local government, both monastic and secular, believed these rumors."

### 当年西藏叛乱起因何在  阿沛披露目击事实真相  指出纯粹是少数上层分子蓄意策划制造

　　当年西藏叛乱起因何在
    阿沛披露目击事实真相
    指出纯粹是少数上层分子蓄意策划制造
    本报讯  一九五九年发生在西藏的“武装叛乱”起因究竟何在？流行于海外的一种谣传说，因为当时西藏军区要把达赖喇嘛和当时西藏地方政府——噶厦政府的主要官员抓上飞机送往内地。这一事件的见证人、现任全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长阿沛·阿旺晋美最近向《中国西藏》的记者披露了这一事件的真相。
    叛乱帷幕的拉开
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说：一九五九年三月十日上午八点多钟，西藏拉萨街头一片混乱。人们在哭喊着奔走相告：“到罗布林卡去保护如意至宝吧！汉人要把他劫走了！”如意至宝是藏族人对达赖喇嘛的尊称。于是，人们怀着震惊、惶惑、恐怖的心情，涌向罗布林卡，以保护达赖喇嘛为名，包围了罗布林卡，揭开了“武装叛乱”的帷幕。
    达赖喇嘛要看文艺节目
    这位藏族出身的全国人大常委会副委员长介绍说：“西藏和平解放后，每年‘破九’都邀请西藏工委和西藏军区的负责人去看‘跳神’。一九五九年，藏历称土猪年的‘破九跳神会’举办时，只有西藏军区政委谭冠三和副司令员邓少东应邀前往布达拉宫。达赖喇嘛会见两位军队负责人时主动提出要看西藏军区文工团演出的新节目。谭、邓当即欣然应允，并根据达赖喇嘛的要求安排在军区礼堂演出。”
    在那里的全体噶伦，即原西藏地方政府的主要官员也都知道这个过程。后来，因为达赖喇嘛有事，去军区看演出的时间就这样拖了下来。
    风云突变
    一九五九年三月九日下午三时左右，西藏工委统战部一位官员告诉阿沛，达赖喇嘛决定三月十日去军区看文工团演出，并要求噶厦官员明天不用到罗布林卡了，可直接去军区礼堂等他。按一般规矩，这一类活动，噶厦官员都应先到罗布林卡，然后随达赖喇嘛出行。阿沛觉得情况不正常，预感要出事。
    西藏军区副司令员被打
    当天下午六七点钟，阿沛接到代理噶伦柳霞·土登塔巴的电话说，要全体噶伦于三月十日上午九时到罗布林卡集合，研究好去的办法后随同他一起去。当时任西藏自治区筹委会秘书长的阿沛说：三月十日上午我没有直接去罗布林卡，而是带着官服先去自治区筹委会主持政治学习，同时等待罗布林卡的电话，看有什么情况。不到十点钟，西藏军区副司令员、西藏地方政府噶伦兼藏军总司令桑颇·才旺仁增坐车去罗布林卡途中被人用石头打伤。十点钟过后，帕巴拉·格列朗杰的哥哥堪穷索朗降措被叛匪打死在罗布林卡门口。很明显，达赖喇嘛是不可能到军区看演出了。我们也不可能去罗布林卡了。我就从筹委会赶到了军区。阿沛·阿旺晋美说：“这就是一九五九年‘三月十日事件’的起因和全过程。”
    谣言是怎样产生的
    国外有人在写这一段历史时，说当时达赖喇嘛不去军区看演出，是因为军区提出在看演出时只准带私人工作人员和少部分警卫，不准其他官员随同前往。对此，阿沛·阿旺晋美说：“这是根本没有的事情”。
    他说，按照常规，当时达赖喇嘛作为西藏的领袖，又是西藏自治区筹委会主任，外出参加活动怎么可能不带随行官员和警卫人员！？事实上，当时西藏军区不仅邀请了达赖喇嘛，而且还邀请了噶厦所有噶伦、达赖喇嘛的两位经师和部分大活佛以及部分贵族。阿沛·阿旺晋美说：“一九五九年在西藏发生的叛乱是毫无道理的。它不是中央政策和中央造成的，而是少数上层分子自己搞起来的。之所以出现有悖事实的说法，是由于别有用心的人制造了谣言，而包括原西藏地方政府的许多僧俗官员也听信了这一谣言。”
