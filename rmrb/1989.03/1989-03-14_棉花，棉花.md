Title: Cotton, Cotton...

The situation has changed so rapidly that it is astonishing.

Just a few days ago, people were still worried about this year's cotton production. Some even presented detailed survey data to prove that farmers were reducing the area they planted with cotton. Officials had to spend a lot of effort to persuade farmers to plant cotton, with little effect. One cotton farmer told me directly, "Without a good price, why bother planting it?"

On March 8, Hebei Province held a provincial radio conference to convey the State Council's notice on price increases. Farmers immediately took action, sending organic fertilizer to the fields, transporting chemical fertilizer to farms, and opening the doors of county seed stations. Here, a group of farmers who originally did not plan to plant cotton and had not prepared seeds gathered...

Before the State Council issued the notice on raising the cotton purchase price, I left Beijing, entered the central part of Hebei, and followed the trail of cotton from cotton mills to cotton fields, also tracing the mindset of people.

"I am already at my wits' end," said Ma Enhua, the director of the Baoding First Cotton Textile Mill, as soon as he opened his mouth. His conversation with the reporter was frequently interrupted by the urgent reports from the workshop directors: the 100,000 spindles in the entire mill were consuming the last batch of stored cotton.

However, upon arriving in the countryside, I found cotton everywhere. On the main roads, farmers' carts and "small four-wheelers" loaded with cotton passed by. In the small cotton ginning mills in the countryside, the courtyards were piled high with cotton. The supply and marketing cooperative officials admitted that the cotton purchase plan had not been completed. They believed that farmers still had cotton in their hands but were unwilling to sell. I followed the farmers' cotton-carrying vehicles to a small spinning mill and was amazed to find so much cotton here. The warehouse inside and outside was piled high with cotton, and outside, more "small four-wheelers" were still pulling cotton bales in. This was quite different from the situation in the large cotton mills in Baoding City.

Last year, Baoding experienced heavy rain and pests, and the cotton yield did indeed decrease. However, it seems that the situation is better than I imagined. There is cotton in the countryside, and the large cotton mills in the city should not have been so tense. The problem is that relying solely on the call for "patriotic cotton" and low-priced monopoly cannot attract farmers to sell all their cotton to the city.

I went to Anxian County, a high-yield cotton county in central Hebei. It is said that to mobilize farmers to sell "patriotic cotton," the county committee's five teams went to the countryside to persuade farmers door-to-door, finally completing the cotton purchase task. This is a rare achievement in the area, and thus received praise from higher authorities. However, County Committee Secretary Yang Tingfang had no joy on his face. Think about it, asking farmers to sell patriotic cotton once, losing nearly 10 million yuan in income. As a leader, is he happy or bitter?

"The most difficult thing is that we have to deal with farmers without considering value," Yang Tingfang said.

His words sparked a wave of discussion among the surrounding people. I have interviewed many county committee leaders and have never seen someone discuss their achievements with such a bitter tone.

The law of value has indeed taken root in people's hearts. Perhaps this is where the hope for cotton lies, I thought.

### 棉花，棉花……

　　棉花，棉花……
    本报记者  凌志军
    形势转变之快令人吃惊。
    就在几天前，人们还在为今年的棉花生产担心，有人甚至拿出详细的调查数据，证明农民正在削减种棉的面积。干部费了不少口舌去说服农民种棉，收获不大。一位棉农亲口对我说：“没个好价，何苦种它。”
    ３月８日，河北省开了全省广播大会，传达了国务院关于提价的通知。农民们立即行动起来，有机肥送到地里，化肥运进农家，县种子站打开了大门，这里聚集起一群原来不打算种棉也没有备种的农民……
    国务院关于提高棉花收购价的通知发布前，我出京城，入冀中，从棉纺厂到棉花田，一路寻着棉花的踪迹，也寻到了人们的心态。
    “我已经焦头烂额了”，保定第一棉纺织厂厂长马恩华一开口便说。他与记者的谈话不断被车间主任们的告急打断：全厂１０万纱锭正在吞吃着最后一批库存棉花。
    但是，一到乡下，却发现到处都有棉花。大路上，农家的马车和“小四轮”满载着棉花擦身而过。乡间小小的轧花厂里，院内院外堆得满满的。供销社的同志承认棉花收购计划未能完成，他们认为农民手里还有棉花，只是不愿卖。我随着农民的运棉车来到一家小纺纱厂，简直不能相信这里竟有这么多棉花，仓库内外，堆积如山，外面仍不断有“小四轮”拖着棉包开进来。这同保定城里大纱厂的景况不可同日而语。
    去年保定多雨、多虫，棉花减产是确实的，但现在看来，毕竟比我想象的要好些。乡下有棉，城里的大纱厂原不该那样紧张的。问题是仅凭“爱国棉”的号召和低价的专营，还不能吸引农民把棉花都卖到城里去。
    我来到安国县，这是冀中棉花高产县，据说，为动员农民交售“爱国棉”，县委五套班子一起下乡，挨户说服农民，总算完成了棉花收购任务。这是当地很少有的大成绩，因而受到上级表扬。但县委书记杨廷芳却没有一点喜色。你想想，让农民卖一次爱国棉，少收入１００多万元。作为一个领导者，他心里是喜还是酸？
    “最难办的事是必须不按价值和农民打交道”，杨廷芳说。
    他的话，引起周围人们的一片议论。我采访过不少县委领导，还从未见过以如此苦涩的口吻谈论自己政绩的场面。
    价值的法则毕竟已深入人心。也许，这正是棉花的希望所在，我想。
