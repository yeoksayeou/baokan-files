	New discoveries have been made at the Sanxingdui cultural site in Sichuan. The site and its surrounding areas have yielded a concentration of artifacts dating back to the Shang and Zhou dynasties.

	According to investigations by the Sichuan Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, numerous early Ba-Shu cultural sites and artifact points are distributed in the Yazi River basin north of the Sanxingdui site in Guanghan City.

	Last November, Chen De'an, deputy leader of the Sichuan Provincial Archaeological Team, led a team of six to follow the Yazi River northward from the Sanxingdui site, covering over 150 kilometers on foot. They discovered 10 Sanxingdui cultural artifact points. Among these, three sites have extensive cultural relics with rich contents.

	This investigation collected some pottery shards and stone tools. The pottery is mainly composed of sand-tempered yellow-brown earthenware and sand-tempered gray earthenware. The shapes include common high-stemmed beans and small flat-bottomed jars, all typical of Sanxingdui culture, dating from the middle to late Shang Dynasty to the early Western Zhou Dynasty. Combined with previous discoveries of early Shu culture sites in other places, it can be generally confirmed that within a radius of about 3000 square kilometers around the Sanxingdui site, including Guanghan, Shifang, Peng County, Xindu, and Chengdu, there are densely distributed early Shu culture—Sanxingdui culture—ancient sites.

	In 1986, when a large number of exquisite pottery, gold, and bronze artifacts and masks were unearthed from the sacrificial pits at the Sanxingdui site, people speculated that this might have been the political and economic center of the early Shu kingdom. The results of this investigation further confirm this point, providing important materials and clues for further research on Ba-Shu culture.

    四川三星堆文化遗址有新发现
    遗址周围文物点密集出土器物时代在商周时期
    新华社成都3月1日电  （记者陈燮）经四川省文物考古研究所调查，在广汉市三星堆遗址北部的鸭子河流域，分布着密集的早期巴蜀文化遗址和文物点。
    去年11月，四川省考古队副队长陈德安率领一个由6人组成的考查组，沿着绕三星堆遗址流过的鸭子河北上，步行150余公里，共发现10个三星堆文化文物点。其中3处遗址文化遗物分布广泛，内涵十分丰富。
    此次调查采集到一些陶器残片和石器。陶器以夹沙黄褐陶，夹沙灰陶为主。器形为常见的高柄豆、小平底罐等，均属三星堆文化典型器物，时代大至在商代中晚期至西周早期。联系以前其他地方早期蜀文化遗址的发现，基本可确定在三星堆遗址周围的广汉、什邡、彭县、新都、成都等地3000平方公里左右范围内，密集地分布着早期蜀文化——“三星堆文化”的古遗址。
    1986年，当大量陶、金、青铜等精美器物、面具由三星堆遗址祭祀坑中出土时，人们便猜测这里是早期蜀国的政治经济中心，此次调查结果进一步确认了这点，这为巴蜀文化的进一步研究提供了重要资料和线索。
