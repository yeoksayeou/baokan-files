The Public Security Bureau of Dongchuan City in Yunnan Province has made a new attempt in the reform of its cadres system. The bureau organized a democratic election for the positions of sub-bureau chiefs, where the candidate with the most votes of confidence would become the chief.

"I am only 28 years old, I have a college degree, and I have worked in criminal investigation, public security, and the office. Later, I served as the director of a sub-bureau. I have a broad knowledge base and can tolerate others. I have the confidence to be a good sub-bureau chief!" This was the impromptu speech given by Huang Hong, the former director of Xin Village Sub-Bureau, at the democratic election meeting organized by the Public Security Bureau of Dongchuan City.

As soon as Huang Hong finished speaking, Wang Jifu, a police officer from Tangdan Sub-Bureau, stood up. He passionately said, "My advantage is that I can endure hardship, I like to work hard, and I don't want to live a mediocre life, to be an ordinary person. I am most afraid of having nothing to do and weekends..."

Their speeches were not long but were to the point and well-structured.

Everyone voted based on their ideological qualities, work abilities, and considering their speeches. The voting results were: Huang Hong received full votes, and Wang Jifu was elected with the majority of votes. Both became the first democratically elected chiefs of Xin Village and Tangdan Sub-Bureaus.

The election results were basically consistent with the upper-level predictions.

The police officers deeply felt that as long as the standards for selecting cadres are given to the masses, the cadres elected from the bottom up have a more solid mass base. This way, it respects the masses, and the upper levels are also satisfied. It is truly a win-win situation, and everyone is happy.

　　东川市公安局干部制度改革的新尝试——        
    谁的信任票多谁就当所长
    “我年方２８，上过大专，又干过刑侦和治安工作，还做过办公室工作，之后又当过派出所指导员。我知识面较广，而且还容得了人，我有信心当好派出所长！”这是前不久在云南省东川市公安局组织的民主选举派出所长的大会上，原新村派出所指导员黄洪即席发表的竞选演说。
    黄洪的话音刚落，汤丹派出所民警王吉福站了起来，他慷慨陈词道：“我的优势在于吃得了苦，喜欢多干工作，不愿碌碌无为地混日子，做庸人，最怕没事干和过星期天……”
    他俩的话不多但语气中肯，有板有眼。
    大伙儿根据他俩的思想素质，工作能力，并参考他们的演说辞，纷纷投出信任票。
    投票结果：黄洪全票通过，王吉福以多数票当选，双双成为新村和汤丹两个派出所民主选举的第一任所长。
    选举结果与上级的预测基本一致。
    干警们深有体会地说：只要把选拔干部的德才标准交给群众，自下而上选出的干部更有坚实的群众基础。这样做，既尊重了群众，上级也满意，真是两全齐美，皆大欢喜。
