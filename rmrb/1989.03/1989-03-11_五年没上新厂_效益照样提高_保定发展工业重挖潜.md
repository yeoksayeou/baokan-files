No new factories have been built in Baoding in the past five years, yet industrial production capacity has doubled and profits have increased by more than three times. This is the most notable aspect of the development of state-owned industrial enterprises in Baoding, Hebei Province, over the past five years.

The Baoding Municipal Party Committee and municipal government have consistently adhered to the principle of relying on potential and winning through adjustment. Over the past five years, almost all of the fixed asset investments in Baoding's state-owned industrial sector have been used for enterprise technological transformation. Now, 60% of the city's industrial output value and 70% of its profits come from technological transformation.

Turning around losses and reducing material consumption are the two major steps Baoding's industry has taken to tap potential and increase efficiency. More than 70 enterprises have taken a number of reform measures for this purpose. In 1983, more than half of the city's factories were operating at a loss; by 1988, there was only one enterprise with operational losses.

　　五年没上新厂　效益照样提高
    保定发展工业重挖潜
    本报石家庄３月１０日电  记者凌志军报道：没有新上一个工厂，工业生产能力增长１倍，利润增长３倍多，这是河北省保定市全民所有制工业企业近５年发展中最引人注目的一点。
    保定市委、市政府始终贯彻一个方针：立足于挖潜，靠调整取胜。５年间保定市全民所有制工业的固定资产投资，几乎全部用于企业技术改造。如今，全市工业６０％的产值和７０％的利润来自技术改造。
    扭转亏损和降低物耗是保定市工业挖潜增效的两大步骤，７０多家企业为此采取了不少改革措施。１９８３年，全市一半以上的工厂亏损；到１９８８年，经营性亏损企业仅有１家。
