An Unpredictable Showdown
– Preview of the Aping Cup Go Final

Due to complex background reasons, the venue for the Aping Cup Go final has not yet been determined, and the date of the final has also been postponed. It is said that the match will now take place in May. However, since Chinese Go fans are not very familiar with Cho Hun-hyeon, it is necessary to preview this decisive battle for the highest prize in the world of Go.

In the past, Go players from mainland China had very little interaction with those from South Korea. The only notable encounters were between Nie Weiping and Cho Hun-hyeon, and Zhao Chengjun. In 1985, when Nie Weiping visited the United States, he had a chance encounter with Cho Hun-hyeon, resulting in two rapid games that ended in a draw. However, these two rapid games do not seem to prove anything. Therefore, some people use the records of their matches against top Japanese players as a reference.

During last year's Aping Cup semifinals in Seoul, a Go expert from Seoul told a Chinese Go expert that Cho Hun-hyeon has had more wins than losses against top Japanese players in recent years. However, Nie Weiping's record against top Japanese players is also very impressive. Therefore, this comparison still does not resolve the question. Thus, some people pay attention to the evaluations of Cho Hun-hyeon in the Go world.

Fujisawa Hideyuki once said, "Cho Hun-hyeon is one of the best Go players in the world today."

Interestingly, Nie and Cho have many similarities. Cho Hun-hyeon was born in 1952, the same year as Nie Weiping. Nie Weiping became a 9-dan in 1982, and Cho also became a 9-dan that same year. Cho is also known as the "victory teacher" in the Go world, and Nie Weiping's strong will to win is also well-known. There is another intriguing similarity: the backgrounds in which Nie and Cho grew up are somewhat similar.

Cho Hun-hyeon, during his youth, went to Japan to study Go under the tutelage of Seiwa Kakuya. Seiwa had cultivated a genius like Go Seigen and famous players like Hashimoto Utaro. Cho's current level is undoubtedly linked to Seiwa's guidance. However, in 1972, Cho left Japan due to military service and never returned to study Go in Japan. Cho's prime period was spent in "teacherless" Seoul. In this regard, Nie Weiping is similar, but Nie is more "homegrown." It is easy to imagine the difficulties a Go player would face growing up in such an environment.

When Cho Hun-hyeon was serving in the military, some people criticized him, saying that he could not continue studying Go in Japan like Zhao Chengjun because of his "poor performance." However, Cho's victory in the Aping Cup semifinals has reversed this evaluation, and his reputation has far surpassed that of Zhao Chengjun.

Nie Weiping has already defeated Zhao Chengjun, and now another opponent, who is already evaluated higher than Zhao Chengjun, has emerged. Obviously, Nie Weiping has no reason to be complacent. Although experts analyze that in the first round of the Aping Cup, Cho Hun-hyeon's victory over Kobayashi Koichi was somewhat lucky, and Nie Weiping defeated Kobayashi Koichi decisively in the Fujitsu Cup. But this comparison is still indirect. In terms of overall strength and willpower, Nie Weiping may have a slight advantage, but the author still believes that Nie Weiping should be prepared for a tough five-game battle.

### 难以预测的决战——应氏杯围棋决赛展望

　　难以预测的决战
    ——应氏杯围棋决赛展望
    由于复杂的背景原因，应氏杯围棋赛的决赛地迄今尚未最后确定，决赛日期也因故拖后，据说已推到５月间进行。但由于中国棋迷对曹薰铉颇为生疏，故展望这场当今世界最高奖金的棋战决战是十分必要的。
    过去中国大陆棋手与南朝鲜棋手交往极少，除聂卫平与曹薰铉、赵治勋较量过，余皆空白。１９８５年聂卫平访美时，曾与曹薰铉邂逅相遇，结果下了两盘快棋打成平手，但两盘快棋似乎说明不了任何问题。因而有人拿二人对日本超一流棋手的战绩为参照物。
    去年汉城应氏杯半决赛，汉城棋界人士曾对中方棋界人士说，曹薰铉近年来与日本超一流棋手之间的比赛胜多负少，但聂卫平对日本超一流选手的战绩也极其辉煌。因此，这个对比还是难以解疑。于是又有人留心棋界对曹薰铉的评价。
    藤泽秀行先生曾几次说：“曹薰铉是当今世界最好的棋手之一。”
    说来也有趣，聂曹之间尚有不少相似之处，曹薰铉１９５２年生，与聂卫平同庚；聂卫平１９８２年升为九段，曹也同年晋升九段，曹与棋界也“胜负师”之称，聂卫平的取胜意志之强也是众所周知。还有一个更耐人寻味的相似之处是，聂曹二人成长的背景也隐隐相似。
    曹薰铉少年时代为学棋曾到日本拜濑越宪作先生为师。濑越先生曾培养出一代奇才吴清源和桥木宇太郎这样的著名棋手，曹有今天显然与濑越的栽培有着必然的联系。但是１９７２年，曹因服兵役离开日本，此后再也没有去日本学棋。曹的棋艺成熟期基本是在“无师无敌的”汉城渡过的。在这点上聂卫平也是如此，只是比起曹来，聂“土生土长”得更彻底些，而一个棋手要在这种背景中成长起来困难是可想而知的。
    曹薰铉服兵役时，曾有人非议他，说他之所以不能像赵治勋那样特许继续在日钻研棋艺是因为“表现不好”，但应氏杯半决赛的胜利，对曹的评价发生了大逆转，声价顿时远远超过赵治勋。
    聂卫平已经击败了赵治勋，眼下又冒出了一个在评价上已超过赵治勋的对手。显然聂卫平是没有任何轻敌的理由的。尽管行家们分析说，在应氏杯首轮比赛中，曹薰铉战胜小林光一那盘棋多少有些侥幸，聂卫平在富士通杯棋赛中则杀得小林光一稀里哗啦。但这种对比毕竟是间接的。从综合水平及意志力上看，聂卫平可能略胜一筹，但笔者仍认为，聂卫平有必要做好苦战五局的准备。
