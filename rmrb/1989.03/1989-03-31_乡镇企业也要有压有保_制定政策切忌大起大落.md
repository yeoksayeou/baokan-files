	Township Enterprises Should Have Both Pressure and Support
	Policy Making Should Avoid Extreme Fluctuations

	BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Delegates attending the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress have been closely following the current difficulties faced by township enterprises. They believe that township enterprises should have a long-term, stable policy, and in the current situation, a policy of both pressure and support should be adopted, avoiding extreme fluctuations.

	Deputy to the National People's Congress, General Manager of Guangdong Yuhua Industrial Company, Qu Jianquan, spoke about the current plight of his enterprise: the operating rate is only half, and the production volume in the first quarter has decreased by 40%. If this trend continues, his plan to export 400,000 microwave ovens and earn 20 million dollars in foreign exchange will only be half completed. This is currently the largest microwave oven production and export company in China. Qu Jianquan's current dilemma is not that the products have no market, but the "identity" problem. "In the past, one leader said township enterprises are the 'greatest success,' another leader said they are the 'necessary path,' but now that the national economy is in difficulty, we have become the target of criticism. Banks' loans to us are 'one-size-fits-all,' with no working capital, how can I produce?"

	Many representatives from various provinces and cities mentioned that some policy-making departments should eliminate their biases. Deputy to the National People's Congress, Secretary of the Nantong Municipal Committee of Jiangsu Province, Wu Rong, said: "In recent years, whenever there are three situations, someone comes out to criticize township enterprises: one is economic overheating; two is grain reduction; three is improper practices. It seems that all these are caused by township enterprises, which is not fair."

	The representatives listed the contributions made by township enterprises in various ways over the years: nearly 10% of the national fiscal revenue, half of the farmers' income, most of the funds for supporting agriculture, as well as funds for rural education and construction, all come from township enterprises.

	More representatives mentioned that a large number of high-quality enterprises and foreign exchange-earning enterprises have emerged, becoming models for the township enterprise army. Today, township enterprises should also have both pressure and support. While firmly slowing down the overall speed, there should be policies to encourage enterprises to self-improve, upgrade, and improve their standards, especially not to suppress good enterprises.

### 乡镇企业也要有压有保  制定政策切忌大起大落

　　乡镇企业也要有压有保        
    制定政策切忌大起大落
    本报北京３月３０日讯  记者凌志军报道：出席七届人大二次会议的代表关注着乡镇企业目前的困境。他们认为，对乡镇企业应有一个长期稳定的政策，在当前也要采取有压有保的方针，切忌大起大落。
    人大代表、广东裕华实业公司总经理区鉴泉谈起他的企业现在的窘境：开工率仅一半，第一季度产量下降４０％。照此下去，他的年出口４０万台微波炉、创汇２０００万美元的计划只能完成一半。这是中国目前最大的微波炉生产、出口厂家。区鉴泉现在的苦恼，不是产品没销路，而是“名分”的困扰。“过去这个领导说乡镇企业是‘最大的成功’，那个领导说是‘必由之路’，可现在国家经济困难，我们又成了众矢之的。银行贷款对我们是‘一刀切’，没有流动资金，我拿什么生产？”
    许多省市的代表谈到，有些制定政策的部门应消除偏见。人大代表、江苏省南通市市委书记吴熔说：“这些年，每逢三种情况，就有人出来骂乡镇企业：一是经济过热；二是粮食减产；三是不正之风。好像这都是乡镇企业造成的，这不公平。”
    代表们历数这些年乡镇企业以各种方式为国家作出的贡献：国家财政收入的近１０％、农民收入的一半、大部分支农资金以及乡村教育、建设资金，都来自乡镇企业。
    更多的代表谈到，现在已经出现了一大批高质量的企业和创汇企业，成为乡镇企业大军中的样板。今天，对乡镇企业也要有压有保，在总量上坚决放慢速度的同时，要有鼓励企业自我改造、上等级、上水平的政策，尤其不能把好企业压死。
