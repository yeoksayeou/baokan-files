Recently, there has been a perception that young people are indifferent to political pursuits and have little interest in joining the Party. Some Party organizations complain about the lack of young people applying to join the Party, finding it difficult to recruit new members. What is the actual situation? Recently, we conducted a survey of 600 young workers in 12 contracted enterprises in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, who have not applied for Party membership. The results are both exciting and concerning.

Among the 600 young people surveyed, 415 have the desire to join the Party but have not written an application, accounting for 69.2% of the total surveyed. The reasons for not applying to join the Party are complex and can be broadly categorized into four types. The first category is those who want to wait until they meet the conditions for Party membership before applying. There are 286 such individuals, accounting for 69%. They subjectively want to join the Party but are unclear about the Party's basic knowledge and the conditions for Party membership, not knowing in which direction to specifically strive. The second category is those who want to wait until older activists join the Party before applying, with 44 individuals, accounting for 10.6%. They believe that since older activists have not yet joined the Party, their applications would not be prioritized. The third category is those who want to wait for the organization to approach them before applying, with 45 individuals, accounting for 10.8%. They fear that if they apply, the Party organization might deem them unqualified, making it embarrassing if they do not get accepted. Additionally, there are 40 individuals who do not dare to apply due to fear of being ridiculed and isolated by others.

Among the 600 young people surveyed, 185 clearly stated that they do not want to join the Party, accounting for 30.8% of the total surveyed. Of these, 20 believe that joining the Party has no benefits, 12 are reluctant to join because they think it will restrict their ability to get rich, and 16 believe that "I am better than Party members, so why join the Party?" Additionally, 3.8% of the young people still doubt the Party's policy of "emphasizing performance," carrying the burden of "family issues" and believing that applying would be futile. Among those who do not want to join the Party, 130 (accounting for 70.3%) believe they once had strong political aspirations, but due to the vagueness of their ideals and beliefs, and when their aspirations were thwarted or they encountered Party members engaging in improper conduct or impure issues within the Party organization, they became disheartened and disappointed.

The survey results indicate that despite the various issues among young people, the majority who clearly express a willingness to join the Party organization have a certain level of political awareness and are not entirely indifferent to political pursuits.

However, while there is excitement, there is also concern. Many young people who want to join the Party are not very clear about the Party's basic knowledge, including the conditions and goals for Party membership. Their political aspirations are, in reality, vague and lack a rational foundation, making it difficult to sustain them over the long term.

To maintain this precious political ambition among young people and to improve their political quality, Party organizations need to change their mindset and improve their working methods to suit the characteristics of young people. They should seriously implement the policy of "maintaining standards, ensuring quality, improving structure, and cautiously developing new members" to improve the quality of new Party members, giving young people a direction to learn and strive for.

　　通化６００名未写入党申请的青年职工调查表明
    政治追求：未冷　矛盾太多：困惑
    目前，不少人认为青年人对政治上的追求冷漠，对入党没有兴趣。有些党组织叫苦于青年中申请入党的少，发展青年入党很困难。实际情况究竟怎样？最近，我们对吉林省通化市属１２家承包企业中６００名未写入党申请的青年进行了一次入党问题调查，结果是让人兴奋又令人担忧。
    被调查的６００名青年中，有４１５名有入党愿望而没写申请书，占调查总数的６９．２％。不写入党申请的情况比较复杂，大体可以分为四种。一是想等具备了党员条件再写申请，这样的青年有２８６名，占６９％。他们主观上想入党，但是对党的基础知识、党员条件不清楚，不知道应该朝哪个方向具体努力。第二种是想等老积极分子入党后再写，有４４名，占１０．６％。他们认为，老积极分子还没有入党，自己写了也排不上号。第三种是等组织找自己谈再申请，有４５名，占１０．８％。他们害怕自己一旦提出申请，党组织又认为不够条件，入不了党太难堪。还有４０名是因为怕别人讽刺挖苦受孤立而不敢申请。
    被调查的６００名青年中，有１８５名明确表示不想入党，占调查总数的３０．８％。其中，认为入党没有好处的２０名，嫌入党受约束影响致富的有１２名，有１６名是因为“我比党员强，入党干啥”而不想入党。还有３．８％的青年仍在怀疑党“重在表现”的政策，至今背着家庭“问题”的包袱，认为提出申请也白搭。不想入党的青年中，有１３０名（占７０．３％）认为他们曾有过较强烈的政治追求，但因追求的理想和自己的信念比较模糊，当自己的追求受到挫折，或遇到某些党员搞不正之风、党组织的某些不纯问题时，就变得灰心和失望。
    调查的结果告诉人们，尽管在青年中有这样或那样的问题，但明确表示愿意加入党的组织、有一定政治觉悟的是大多数，并不是青年人都对政治上的追求没有任何兴趣。
    但在令人兴奋的同时，也让人不无担忧。许多想入党的青年，对党的基础知识包括党员条件和奋斗目标都不甚清楚。他们的政治追求，实际上是模糊的，没有理性支柱，不可能维持长久。
    要保持青年中这种可贵的政治上进心，提高他们的政治素质，党的组织要转变观念，针对青年人的特点改进工作方法。要认真执行“坚持标准，保证质量，改善结构，慎重发展”的方针，提高新党员的质量，使青年人有学习和努力的方向。
