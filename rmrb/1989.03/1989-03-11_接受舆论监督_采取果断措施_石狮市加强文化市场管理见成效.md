	Accepting Public Opinion Supervision and Taking Decisive Measures
	Shishi City Strengthens Cultural Market Management with Success

	Editor's Note: Shishi City's approach of seriously accepting public opinion supervision, acting swiftly, and taking decisive measures to strengthen cultural market management serves as a mirror for those units and individuals who cover up shortcomings and errors and ignore public criticism. What is particularly commendable is that the Propaganda and Cultural Departments of Fujian Province seized this opportunity to rectify the cultural market across the province. If all levels of leadership departments could act like Fujian Province in managing the cultural market—speaking and doing, speaking and managing, and being determined to achieve results—our work would be much easier.

	On January 14th, your newspaper's fifth edition published a letter to the editor titled "A Word to the People of Shishi," which exposed the chaotic state of Shishi City's cultural market, where obscene videos and publications were rampant on the streets. After investigation, it was confirmed that the situation was true. Comrade He Shaochuan, a member of the Provincial Party Committee and head of the Propaganda Department, instructed that the leaders of Shishi City and relevant units should "take effective measures to achieve results."

	On January 16th, Shishi City Party Secretary Liu Chengye and Deputy Secretary Su Fuda, along with leaders from the Public Security Bureau and relevant departments, held a special meeting to deploy the investigation work. By February 10th, the city had uncovered three points of obscene video copying, seizing 42 video players, 9 televisions, and 1 generator; confiscated 8,187 illegally copied video tapes (including 687 obscene tapes), 519 illegally copied audio tapes, 15 sets of nude playing cards, 10 obscene publications, and goods worth over 360,000 yuan; 9 people were placed under residential surveillance, 8 were fined, and 7 received other punishments. The Industrial and Commercial Bureau and the Urban Management Supervision Squad dealt with 26 street vendors selling illegal video tapes, cleared out chaotic stalls, and removed chaotic slogans and advertisements, significantly improving the urban environment. Before the Spring Festival, the province concentrated its efforts to handle more than 50 cases of illegal video copying and broadcasting, seizing more than 1,000 obscene video tapes, more than 20,000 sets of obscene playing cards, and a batch of illegally published books, detaining and investigating some lawbreakers, and dealing with relevant responsible parties.

	On January 27th, the Provincial Cultural Bureau, based on Shishi City's handling and severe crackdown on social evils, formulated the Provincial Cultural System's Video Distribution Regulations, strictly prohibiting the smuggling, copying, and screening of reactionary, obscene, violent, murderous, and superstitious video tapes.

	Shishi City is a comprehensive reform experimental city in our province. Now, the people of Shishi, along with the people of the entire province, are taking the newspaper and readers' concern and support for Fujian and Shishi City as a driving force to strive to build Shishi City into a "civilized window," letting the famous overseas Chinese hometown "Pearl of Minnan" shine with new luster.

　　接受舆论监督　采取果断措施
    石狮市加强文化市场管理见成效
    编者按：石狮市这种认真接受舆论监督，雷厉风行，采取果断措施加强文化市场管理的做法，给那些对缺点错误遮遮掩掩，对群众批评置之不理的单位和人提供了一面镜子。尤其可贵的是，福建省宣传、文化部门抓住此事，举一反三，主动地对全省的文化市场进行整顿。如果我们各级领导部门都像福建省抓文化市场那样，说干就干，说管就管，并且决心抓出成效，我们的事情就好办了。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    今年１月１４日，你报第五版刊登题为《向石狮人进一言》的读者来信，反映石狮市文化市场混乱，淫秽录像、书刊充斥街头。经查，情况属实。省委常委、宣传部长何少川同志批示，石狮市和有关单位领导要“采取有力措施，抓出成效。”
    １月１６日，石狮市委书记刘成业、副书记苏富达会同市公安局及有关部门领导同志，专门召开会议，具体部署清查工作。截至２月１０日，全市查出复制淫秽录像点３个，缴获录像机４２台，电视机９台，发电机１台；查获非法复制录像带８１８７盒（其中淫秽录像带６８７盒），非法复制录音带５１９盒，裸体扑克１５副，淫秽书刊１０本，赃款赃物价值３６万多元；已办理监视居住手续的９人，被罚款的８人，作其它处理的７人。市工商局和市容监察大队处理了街头兜售非法录像带的２６个推销者，清理乱设的摊位，清除乱贴的标语广告，使市容有了明显改观。春节前，全省集中力量查处非法录像和淫秽录像的复制和播放５０多起，收缴淫秽录像带１０００多盒，淫秽扑克２万余副及一批非法出版的书刊，收容审查了一些违法分子，处理了有关责任者。
    １月２７日，省文化厅根据石狮市查处和严厉打击社会丑恶现象的情况，制定了省文化系统录像片发行办法，严禁走私、翻录和放映反动、淫秽、恐怖凶杀、散布封建迷信的录像带等。
    石狮市是我省改革的综合试验城市。现在，石狮人正在和全省人民一起，把报纸和读者对福建和石狮市的关心和支持，作为前进的动力，为把石狮市建设成“文明窗口”而努力，让著名侨乡“闽南明珠”放出新的光彩。
