From the east-southeast suburbs of Paris, at the French royal palace of Fontainebleau, take a car heading northwest through lush, verdant forests to reach a small, ordinary village by the forest—Barbizon.

There are no grand palaces or mansions here, but it is a tourist destination, especially beloved by painters and art enthusiasts from various countries. This is because it is the birthplace of the French "Barbizon School," known for its significant position in the history of world art and its fresh, elegant charm.

In the mid-19th century, Paris was filled with the corrupt and decadent political atmosphere of the late Bourbon dynasty. The art world was dominated by the rigid classical doctrines of the academic school. Many artists felt oppressed and weary, often leaving the bustling city to Barbizon to sketch or settle in the village. They used the scenic beauty of the Fontainebleau Forest and the simple rural life as their creative subjects, expressing their love for their country and their longing for freedom. In their works, natural landscapes were no longer just the background for figures but became the main subjects. They paved the way for French realistic landscape painting and inspired the creation of the Impressionist style.

Following the winding, cobblestone paths, there are a few restaurants and grocery stores along the way, but the few art studios are unique to this village. A two-story brick building with a wooden sign hanging above the door reads: "Père Ganne's Inn." Painters such as Millet, Jacque, Rousseau, Corot, and Diaz often gathered here to discuss art, and some even lived here. A painting by Millet, "The Angelus," hangs by the door. The inn has not been renovated and retains its ancient appearance from over a hundred years ago, a true "old man," though it is no longer in business. The ground floor is the Barbizon School Museum, displaying many of their famous works created in Barbizon, such as Corot's "Souvenir of Montfou," "The Pond," Rousseau's "The Road to Fontainebleau Forest and Sunset," Diaz's "Fontainebleau Forest," and Millet's "The Sower," "Gleaners," "The Man with the Hoe," and "The Shepherdess." The small exhibition room is filled with visitors, but it is silent, as if everyone is quietly reading a series of pastoral poems with deep emotional resonance.

In the center of the village stands a two-story cottage, which was rented by Théodore Rousseau, one of the founders of the Barbizon School, in 1847. He lived and worked here for twenty years until his death in 1867. It was later converted into his painting museum. A small alley nearby is named after Rousseau. Not far away, a burst of vibrant red catches the eye, like a magnificent sunrise, which is a cottage covered in maple leaves. A sign on the wall reads: "Millet's residence from 1849 to 1875," which was rented from a farmer's barn. He came from a peasant family and lived in poverty, working the land while creating art. He held deep affection for peasants and was the first in European art history to depict "heroes of the soil," fundamentally changing the tradition of painting that focused on emperors, nobles, high society, and religious stories.

From Millet's former residence and museum, one can see the Fontainebleau Forest outside the village. Leaving the village, I walked slowly up the rolling hills, stepping on the golden fallen leaves, which crunched underfoot. Occasionally, a few acorns and pinecones would fall from the trees. Scattered around the hillside were some thick, sturdy rocks. On one facing me, a rectangular bronze relief was embedded: the side profiles of Rousseau and Millet, two close friends, gazing together at the dense forest.

Their contributions were not limited to painting. I noticed that on a nearby rock, there were a few lines of text: "In 1853, the artists living in Barbizon, including Rousseau and Millet, petitioned the government to protect the artistic resources of Fontainebleau. This sparked a social trend of protecting nature, and it is said that the global environmental protection movement originated from this." I sat down to rest for a moment under the rocks. The surrounding mountains, forests, and fields were so tranquil and profound. Nature provided artists with endless inspiration, and artists became ardent protectors of nature. Thus, more and more painters came here to sketch, including the French Impressionists Monet, Sisley, and painters from Romania, Hungary, Japan, and other countries. The national characteristics and local flavor of this forest village nurtured the globally influential "Barbizon" style.

　　巴比松画乡情
    杨兆麟
    从巴黎市东南郊的法国王家宫苑枫丹白露乘汽车向西北行驶，穿过葱翠、繁茂的大森林，到达林边一个普通的村庄——巴比松。
    这里没有堂皇富丽的王宫、府邸，却是一个旅游胜地，尤其为各国的画家和艺术爱好者们所向往，因为这里是法国“巴比松画派”的诞生地，以它在世界美术史上的重要地位和清新、优雅的风貌而独具魅力。
    １９世纪中叶，巴黎弥漫着波旁王朝末期的腐败、没落的政治空气，画坛则被僵守古典教条的学院派所统治，一些画家感到压抑和厌倦，常常离开喧闹的市区，到巴比松来写生或者移居村中，以枫丹白露森林的旖旎风光和淳朴的农村生活为创作题材，寄托对祖国的热爱和对自由的渴望。在他们的作品中，自然风光不再只是人物的背景，而是描绘的主要对象，他们开拓了法国现实主义风景画的道路，并且启发和诱导了印象画派的创作风格。
    沿着弯弯的石块铺砌的道路走去，街边有几家饭店、杂货铺，唯独那几间画室是在别的村庄看不到的。一座砖石结构的二层楼，门端横悬一块木牌，白底黑字：戈纳老爹饭店。米勒、雅克、卢梭、柯罗、迪阿兹等画家经常在这里聚会谈艺，有的曾住在这里，门旁挂着米勒的名作《晚祷》。这家饭店未加修饰，仍然保持着它１００多年前的古旧面貌，是一位名副其实的龙钟“老爹”，只是早已不营业了。楼下是巴比松画派博物馆，展出他们在巴比松创作的许多名画，像柯罗的《孟特芳丹的回忆》和《池塘》，卢梭的《枫丹白露森林路口和日落》，迪阿兹的《枫丹白露的森林》，米勒的《播种者》、《拾穗》、《扶锄的人》、《牧羊女》等。不大的展室里挤满了参观的人们，却悄无声息，都好像在默读一首首有着浓郁抒情意味的田园诗。
    村子中间有二层小楼，是巴比松画派创始人之一卢梭１８４７年租用的一家农舍，他在这里创作、生活了整整２０个春秋，直到１８６７年逝世，以后改为他的绘画博物馆，屋旁一条小巷取名卢梭街。走不多远，眼前闪现一片艳红，犹如瑰丽的朝霞，那是一座爬满了枫叶的农舍。墙上的一块牌子标明：米勒１８４９年到１８７５年的住所，是租用农民的谷仓。他出身于一个农民的家庭，生活清贫，在这里一面耕种、一面创作。他对农民怀着深厚的感情，在欧洲美术史上第一个以“泥土上的英雄”作为绘画的主人，根本改变了帝王贵族、上流社会、宗教故事占有画面的传统。
    从米勒故居和博物馆可以看到村外的枫丹白露森林。出了村口，我缓步走上起伏的丘陵，踏着金灿灿的落叶，脚下沙沙作响，树上不时掉下几颗橡实和松塔。山坡上散落着一些厚墩墩的岩石，迎面的一块上，横嵌着长方形的青铜浮雕：卢梭和米勒这一对挚友的侧面头像，他们并肩凝望着翁郁的大森林。
    他们的贡献不仅限于绘画方面，我发现旁边的一块岩石上刻着几行字：１８５３年卢梭、米勒等在巴比松居住的艺术家们，向政府申请保护枫丹白露的艺术资源。一时形成了保护大自然的社会风尚，据说，如今在全世界广为发展的环境保护运动即导源于此。我坐在岩石下面小憩片刻，周围的山林草野多么恬静、多么深邃啊。大自然给予艺术家们无尽的创作灵感，艺术家们又成为大自然的热心保护者。于是，越来越多的画家到这里来写生，包括继之发展起来的法国印象画派的莫奈、西斯莱和罗马尼亚、匈牙利、日本等国的画家。这个林边村庄的民族特色和乡土气息陶冶出具有世界影响的一代“巴比松”画风。
