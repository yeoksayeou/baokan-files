Edition: 5

In recent years, some enterprises, institutions, organizations, and government agencies have violated national laws, regulations, and policies, as well as relevant regulations and policies of the State Council, using various means to engage in speculative activities to seek illegal profits for their units. Particularly, some agencies and units have used their authority to engage in speculative activities, seriously disrupting the normal economic order and environment, and hindering the smooth progress of reform and construction. In addition to administrative penalties imposed by relevant state administrative departments in accordance with the "Interim Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Speculation" and other administrative regulations, those whose offenses are serious and constitute crimes must be punished in accordance with the law, and the criminal responsibilities of the directly responsible persons in charge and other directly responsible persons shall be investigated. Based on the relevant provisions of the Criminal Law, the relevant supplementary provisions of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the judicial interpretations in the "Answers to Several Specific Issues in the Application of Laws in the Handling of Economic Crime Cases at Present (Trial)" (No. 3 of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate in 1985), the following provisions are specially made on how to handle the crimes of speculation by state agencies, enterprises, and institutions:

1. Enterprises, institutions, organizations, and government agencies that violate national laws, regulations, and policies, as well as relevant regulations and policies of the State Council, engage in speculative activities to seek illegal profits for their units, with particularly large amounts involved, and use vicious means to seriously disrupt the socialist economic order or seriously harm the interests of the state, collective, and the people, shall, in addition to being punished in accordance with administrative regulations, have the criminal responsibilities of the directly responsible persons in charge and other directly responsible persons investigated in accordance with the law. All property obtained from the unit's speculation shall be confiscated.

Generally, the amount involved in speculative activities by enterprises, institutions, organizations, and government agencies that reaches 300,000 to 600,000 yuan, or the illegal profit amount reaches 100,000 to 200,000 yuan, is considered the starting point for "particularly large amounts." The higher people's courts and people's procuratorates of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government can, in accordance with the economic development and economic crime situation of their regions, together with relevant departments, refer to the above-mentioned amounts to propose specific amount standards for their regions. In handling cases, they should combine the amount standards determined by their regions with other constituent conditions of unit speculation to decide whether to investigate the criminal responsibilities of relevant personnel.

Speculative activities by enterprises, institutions, organizations, and government agencies with vicious means refer to the above-mentioned units colluding with other units or individuals to engage in speculative activities, or converting planned materials and quotas into non-planned materials and quotas for resale at a higher price to seek excessive profits, etc.

Although the speculative activities of enterprises, institutions, organizations, and government agencies have not reached the prescribed amount standards, if there are other particularly serious circumstances, such as producing, selling, and speculating in fake pesticides, seeds, fertilizers, as well as fake medicines and fake alcohol, disrupting agricultural and industrial production or endangering people's lives and health; using funds and materials with special important uses such as disaster relief and rescue for speculation; and speculating in important agricultural materials, grains, and other important production and living materials that affect the national economy and people's livelihood, the criminal responsibilities of the directly responsible persons in charge and other directly responsible persons shall also be investigated in accordance with the law. If the law or judicial interpretation has other provisions on the nature of the crime and the amount standard, it shall be handled in accordance with the provisions.

2. Enterprises, institutions, organizations, and government agencies that, for the purpose of seeking illegal profits, collude with speculative units (including units with subordinate relationships) to provide approval documents, sources of goods, funds, account numbers, invoices, certificates, or provide transportation, storage, labor organization, or other conveniences, if the circumstances are serious, the directly responsible persons in charge and other directly responsible persons shall be investigated for criminal responsibilities as accomplices in speculation in accordance with the law.

3. For speculative crimes by enterprises, institutions, organizations, and government agencies that meet the standards of the first article, the directly responsible persons in charge and other directly responsible persons shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of Article 117 of the Criminal Law; for a few cases with particularly serious circumstances, they shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of Article 118 of the Criminal Law. For those who embezzle among the directly responsible persons in charge and other directly responsible persons, they shall be punished more severely in accordance with the law if they are found to be involved in individual speculation; if they are found to be involved in embezzlement or bribery, they shall be punished in accordance with the law for multiple offenses.

State functionaries who use their positions to commit speculation crimes individually or in collusion with others shall be punished more severely in accordance with the provisions of Article 119 of the Criminal Law and the relevant provisions of the "Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Severely Punishing Criminals Who Seriously Disrupt the Economy."

Private enterprises or individuals who illegally establish economic organizations and engage in speculation that constitutes a crime shall be identified as individual speculation.

4. Cases that have been handled in accordance with the relevant provisions of the "Answers to Several Specific Issues in the Application of Laws in the Handling of Economic Crime Cases at Present (Trial)" by the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate before the issuance of these provisions shall not be changed. Cases that have not been handled or are being handled after the issuance of these provisions shall be handled in accordance with these provisions.

　　依法惩处“官倒”
    ——最高人民法院最高人民检察院关于当前处理企业事业单位机关团体投机倒把犯罪案件的规定
    近几年来，一些企业事业单位、机关、团体违反国家有关法律法规，以及国务院有关规定和政策，通过各种手段进行投机倒把活动，为本单位牟取非法利益，特别是有些机关、单位利用手中掌握的权力从事投机倒把活动，严重地破坏了正常的经济秩序和经济环境，妨害了改革和建设事业的顺利进行。对此，除一般应由国家行政主管部门依照国务院《投机倒把行政处罚暂行条例》及其他行政法规予以行政处罚外，其中情节严重，构成犯罪的，必须依法惩处，追究其直接负责的主管人员和其他直接责任人员的刑事责任。根据刑法的有关规定、全国人大常委会的有关补充规定，并参照最高人民法院、最高人民检察院（８５）高检会（研）字第３号《关于当前办理经济犯罪案件中具体应用法律的若干问题的解答（试行）》中，关于如何处理国家机关、企业事业单位投机倒把罪的几个问题的司法解释，特作如下规定：
    一、企业事业单位、机关、团体违反国家有关法律、法规，以及国务院有关规定和政策，进行投机倒把活动，为本单位牟取非法利益，数额特别巨大，并且手段恶劣，严重破坏社会主义经济秩序或者严重危害国家、集体和人民群众利益的，除按照行政法规予以处罚外，对直接负责的主管人员和其他直接责任人员应依法追究刑事责任。单位投机倒把所得的一切财物，应予追缴。
    企业事业单位、机关、团体进行投机倒把活动，一般以非法经营数额达到３０万元至６０万元，或者非法获利数额达到１０万元至２０万元为“数额特别巨大”的起点。各省、自治区、直辖市高级人民法院、人民检察院可以根据本地区经济发展状况以及经济犯罪情况，会同有关部门，参照上列数额意见，提出本地区具体数额标准。并在办理案件中，将本地区确定的数额标准和单位投机倒把的其他构成条件结合起来考虑，决定是否追究有关人员的刑事责任。
    企业事业单位、机关、团体进行投机倒把活动手段恶劣，是指上述单位与其他单位或个人内外勾结进行投机倒把活动，或者把国家计划内物资、指标转为计划外物资、指标，加价倒卖牟取暴利等。
    企业事业单位、机关、团体的投机倒把活动虽未达到规定的数额标准，但有其他特别严重情节的，如生产、推销、倒卖假农药、假种子、假化肥、以及假药、假酒等伪劣商品，破坏工农业生产或者危害人民生命和健康；以救灾抢险等有特殊重要用途的款物进行投机倒把；以及倒卖重要农用物资、粮食等影响国计民生的重要生产、生活资料等，亦应依法追究直接负责的主管人员和其他直接责任人员的刑事责任。如果法律或司法解释对犯罪性质、数额标准另有规定的，依照该规定办理。
    二、企业事业单位、机关、团体为牟取非法利益，与投机倒把单位（包括相互有隶属关系的单位）通谋，为其提供批件、货源、资金、帐号、发票、证明，或者为其提供运输、保管、组织劳务或者给与其他方便，情节严重的，对其直接负责的主管人员和其他直接责任人员，以投机倒把的共犯依法追究刑事责任。
    三、企业事业单位、机关、团体进行投机倒把犯罪，符合本规定第一条标准的，对其直接负责的主管人员和其他直接责任人员，依照刑法第１１７条的规定处罚；对于少数情节特别严重的，依照刑法第１１８条的规定处罚。对于直接负责的主管人员和其他直接责任人员中饱私囊的，分别不同情况，如果属于个人投机倒把，依法从重处罚；如果属于贪污或者受贿等犯罪，依法实行数罪并罚。
    国家工作人员利用职务上的便利个人或伙同他人犯投机倒把罪的，依照刑法第１１９条和全国人大常委会《关于严惩严重破坏经济的罪犯的决定》中的有关规定，从重处罚。
    私营企业或者个人非法成立的经济组织投机倒把构成犯罪的，应按个人投机倒把认定。
    四、本规定下发以前，按照最高人民法院、最高人民检察院《关于当前办理经济犯罪案件中具体应用法律的若干问题的解答（试行）》中的有关规定处理过的案件，不再变动。本规定下发以后尚未办理或者正在办理的案件，按照本规定办理。
