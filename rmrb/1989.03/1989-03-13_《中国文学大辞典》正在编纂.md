Author: Shé Kē
Date: 1989-03-13
Edition: 4

The compilation of the "Encyclopedia of Chinese Literature" began last year. The project is led by Liu Zaifu and Ma Liangchun, the current and former directors of the Institute of Literature at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The encyclopedia will consist of approximately ten volumes and 45,000 entries, totaling 20 million words. It will cover all literary phenomena from ancient to contemporary times, including writers, works, literary trends, schools, societies, periodicals, events, and movements. Literary theory, ethnic minority literature, literature from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and folk literature will also be given due attention, with corresponding entries allocated according to their significance. In addition to creative writers, theorists, critics, translators, and editors will also be included for their unique contributions to Chinese literature. Publishing departments across the country have provided a wealth of previously unpublished biographical materials on contemporary editors, enriching the content of this encyclopedia. This will be the most comprehensive literary reference work of its kind in contemporary times.

In terms of writing the entries, the authors of this encyclopedia adhere to an objective narrative style, striving for accuracy, conciseness, and clarity. For writers, the entries will sequentially introduce their biographies, works, historical significance, and influence. For works, the entries will sequentially introduce their genre, author, length, editions, main content, and social evaluations. For ancient texts, the entries will also briefly describe subsequent annotations, compilations, editing, and critiques. For societies and schools, the entries will focus on their origins, principles, key members, and activities. For periodicals, the entries will focus on their nature, issues, founding principles, publication dates, and influence. Major entries will also introduce the editors of each issue.

The book will be published by Tianjin People's Publishing House.
