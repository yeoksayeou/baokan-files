Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, March 12th.

Famous for its honey tangerines, Jiangxi Province's Nanfeng County has added 30,000 mu of new citrus groves over the past three years, bringing the total area of citrus cultivation in the county to 60,000 mu.

Many villages in Nanfeng County lack electricity, capital, and talent, making it difficult to establish township and village enterprises. However, honey tangerines are their traditional product. Based on this, they took decisive measures to develop "green enterprises" as a key focus for the development of township and village enterprises.

This approach has yielded remarkable results. Currently, every village in the county has citrus orchards covering 6,200 mu, and each village has its own orchard farm.

　　南丰发展“绿色企业”
    新华社南昌３月１２日电  （通讯员吴武、记者李沁源）以蜜桔闻名的江西省南丰县３年新增桔园３万亩，使全县柑桔面积达到６万亩。
    南丰县许多村没有电，缺资金少人才，办乡镇工业企业较困难，蜜桔却是它们的传统产品。据此他们断然采取措施，把发展“绿色企业”作为发展乡镇企业的重点。
    此举产生令人叹服的结果，现在全乡共有柑桔林６２００亩，村村有了园艺场。
