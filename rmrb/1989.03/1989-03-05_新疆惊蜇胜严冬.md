Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, March 3rd

The season has reached the time of "Awakening of Insects" (惊蛰), but there are still no signs of spring in various parts of Xinjiang. Today, the temperature in Urumqi dropped to minus twenty-one degrees Celsius, approaching the lowest value since the beginning of winter.

Meteorological authorities say this is due to a strong cold air mass from Western Siberia. The recent heavy snowfall has covered the entire city of Urumqi with nearly twenty centimeters of snow.

　　新疆惊蜇胜严冬
    据新华社乌鲁木齐三月三日电  （记者樊英利）时令已近惊蜇，但新疆各地却依然看不到春天的迹象。今天乌鲁木齐的气温是负二十一摄氏度，接近入冬以来的最低值。
    气象部门说，这是由西西伯利亚的一股强冷空气造成的。近日的一场大雪，竟使乌鲁木齐全城皆白，积雪近二十厘米。
