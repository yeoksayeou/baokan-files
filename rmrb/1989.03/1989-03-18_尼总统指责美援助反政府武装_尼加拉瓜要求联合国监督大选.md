Xinhua News Agency, Managua, March 15th.

Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega expressed concern on March 15th over the U.S. government's plan to continue providing new "humanitarian" aid to Nicaraguan anti-government forces, stating that this would "harm the peace process in Central America."

A U.S. State Department official announced on March 12th that the U.S. plans to provide approximately $50 million in aid to Nicaraguan anti-government forces from April of this year to February of next year, in order to pressure the Nicaraguan government to hold free elections as scheduled in February 1990.

Ortega, at a press conference on March 15th, urged U.S. President George H.W. Bush and the U.S. Congress to respect the new agreement reached in February by the five Central American heads of state to accelerate the peaceful resolution of the Central American issue.

Ortega pointed out, "Only a plan that benefits the cessation of activities by anti-government forces is truly humanitarian aid."

Last February, after the U.S. stopped providing military aid to Nicaraguan anti-government forces, it provided $27 million in "humanitarian" aid. This sum will be fully provided by March of this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Managua, March 16th.

Nicaraguan Vice President Sergio Ramirez stated on March 16th that if the U.S. government insists on continuing to provide aid to Nicaraguan anti-government forces, the Nicaraguan government will find it difficult to grant amnesty to all political prisoners in the coming days.

Ramirez made these remarks after a meeting with members of the National Reconciliation Commission.

Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, March 16th.

A United Nations spokesperson said today that Nicaragua has formally requested that the United Nations oversee the 10-month election process in Nicaragua, which is set to conclude on February 25, 1990.

The UN spokesperson said that the United Nations is currently considering Nicaragua's request.

According to the agreement reached by the five Central American heads of state at their summit in El Salvador last month, the various parties in Nicaragua will spend four months preparing for the elections and then six months campaigning.

The election date is set for February 25, 1990.

　　尼总统指责美援助反政府武装
    尼加拉瓜要求联合国监督大选
    新华社马那瓜３月１５日电  尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加１５日对美国政府将继续向尼反政府武装提供新的“人道主义”援助计划表示担忧，认为这“将会损害中美洲和平进程”。
    美国国务院官员１２日宣布，美计划在今年４月至明年２月期间向尼反政府武装力量提供约５０００万美元的援助，以迫使尼政府在１９９０年２月如期举行自由选举。
    奥尔特加总统１５日在记者招待会上呼吁布什总统和美国国会尊重中美洲５国首脑今年２月达成的加速中美洲问题和平解决的新协议。
    奥尔特加指出，“那种有利于实现反政府武装停止活动的计划才是真正的人道主义援助”。
    去年２月，美国向尼加拉瓜反政府武装停止提供军援后，提供了２７００万美元的“人道主义”援助。这笔钱于今年３月将提供完毕。
    新华社马那瓜３月１６日电　尼加拉瓜副总统塞尔希奥·拉米雷斯１６日指出，如果美国政府坚持继续向尼加拉瓜反政府武装力量提供援助，尼政府很难在今后几天内大赦全部政治犯。
    拉米雷斯是在同全国和解委员会的成员举行会议之后向新闻界发表上述讲话的。
    新华社联合国３月１６日电　联合国一位发言人今天说，尼加拉瓜已正式请求联合国监督尼加拉瓜持续１０个月的大选过程，直至１９９０年２月２５日大选结束。
    这位联合国发言人说，联合国目前正在考虑尼加拉瓜的这一要求。
    根据中美洲５国总统上月在萨尔瓦多举行的首脑会议上达成的协议，尼各党派将在４个月的预选期内进行选举的组织和动员准备，然后用６个月的时间进行正式竞选。
    大选日期定在１９９０年２月２５日。
