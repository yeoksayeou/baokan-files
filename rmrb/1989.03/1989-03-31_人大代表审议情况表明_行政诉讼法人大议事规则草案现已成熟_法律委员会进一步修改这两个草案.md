The Seventh National People's Congress Legal Affairs Committee held a meeting this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People to summarize the opinions of various delegations on the Administrative Litigation Law and the Rules of Procedure for the National People's Congress, conduct research and analysis, and make amendments item by item.

Most representatives believe that the newly drafted Administrative Litigation Law is an important law following the Criminal Procedure Law and the Civil Procedure Law. This draft has undergone public discussion and multiple revisions and is now mature, and should be passed as soon as possible. Representatives pointed out that the promulgation of the Administrative Litigation Law is an important measure to support the current efforts to rectify the economic environment, rectify economic order, and promote clean governance. It is an effective law to ensure that administrative officials strictly follow the law and improve work efficiency.

Some representatives are concerned that many administrative management tasks currently lack legal basis and often rely on administrative orders. They worry that after the implementation of the Administrative Litigation Law, the supporting laws and regulations may not keep up, affecting grassroots work. They hope that supporting laws and regulations will be in place, or that the implementation of the Administrative Litigation Law will be delayed.

Regarding the draft Rules of Procedure for the National People's Congress, representatives believe that as the highest organ of state power, the National People's Congress should conduct its deliberations in accordance with the law and be protected and supervised by the law. It is necessary to formulate rules. At the same time, it is consistent with relevant provisions of the Constitution and the Organic Law of the National People's Congress, and it is suggested that it be promulgated and implemented.

　　人大代表审议情况表明        
    行政诉讼法人大议事规则草案现已成熟        
    法律委员会进一步修改这两个草案
    本报北京３月３０日讯  记者晓渡报道：第七届全国人民代表大会法律委员会今天下午在人民大会堂举行会议，汇总各代表团对行政诉讼法与人民代表大会议事规则的意见，进行研究分析，逐条修改。
    多数代表认为：新制定的行政诉讼法，是继刑事诉讼法和民事诉讼法之后又一个重要法律。这个法的草案经过全民讨论，多次修改，现已成熟，应当尽快通过。代表指出，颁布行政诉讼法是配合当前治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、搞好廉政的重要措施。它是维护和促进行政机关工作人员严格依法办事，提高工作效率的有效法律。
    有些代表认为，目前有许多行政管理工作无法可依，常常是靠行政命令来工作。他们担心行政诉讼法实施后，配套的法律法规跟不上，影响基层工作。希望配套法律法规跟上，或推迟实施行政诉讼法。
    对全国人民代表大会议事规则草案，代表们认为：作为我国最高权力机关的全国人民代表大会，它的议事活动应该依法进行并得到法律的保护和监督，制定规则是很必要的。同时，它与我国宪法、全国人大组织法的有关规定相一致，建议颁布施行。
