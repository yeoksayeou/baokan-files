Just after the New Year, the Communist Party of Shandong Province's Yantai Municipal Committee made a decision: to confer the title of "Model Communist Party Member" on Jia Cuntai, the Party Branch Secretary of Qiaoguo Township's Qiaotou Village in Laizhou City, and to posthumously recognize his son, the 18-year-old Communist Youth League member Jia Wenkai, as a formal member of the Chinese Communist Party. They also called on all Party members, Youth League members, and cadres and the masses of the entire city to learn from this pair of "heroic father and son."

Facing Life and Death

On July 25, 1988, Jia Cuntai, the Party Branch Secretary of Qiaotou Village in Qiaoguo Township, Laizhou City, and his family of four were weeding and spraying pesticides in their contracted orchard. The weather was scorching. Jia Wenkai, Jia Cuntai's eldest son and a member of the Communist Youth League, had gone to a nearby reservoir to wash a few melons and was on his way back when he heard two splashes. Looking back, he saw two teenagers from the same village, Jia Jianping and Wang Yingguang, who had been playing by the reservoir, fall into the water! He saw the two 15-year-old boys struggling desperately in the water, screaming for help.

Seeing this, Jia Wenkai dropped the melons and ran towards the reservoir. He forgot that he didn't know how to swim, didn't take off his clothes, and didn't remove his glasses. He jumped into the water and lunged towards Wang Yingguang. With all his might, he pushed Wang Yingguang towards the shore. Turning back, he went to save Jia Jianping. Jia Jianping, who was struggling, clung tightly to Jia Wenkai and wouldn't let go. Exhausted from a morning of hard work, Jia Wenkai was at his wits' end. He struggled to push Jia Jianping away, but to no avail...

Just as Jia Wenkai was desperately trying to save Jia Jianping, Jia Cuntai heard the cries for help, dropped his tools, and rushed down the hill. When he reached the reservoir, he saw that Wang Yingguang, who had been pushed towards the shore by Jia Wenkai from the deep water, had slipped back into the deep water.

At this moment, Jia Wenkai, Jia Jianping, and Wang Yingguang were all struggling in the water, their cries for help tearing at the heart.

Jia Cuntai, this ordinary Communist Party member, first lunged towards Wang Yingguang. He pushed Wang Yingguang from the deep water towards the shore. Just as he was about to turn back, Wang Yingguang, in his panic, slipped back into the deep water. Jia Cuntai took a deep breath and lunged towards him again, using all his strength to push him onto the shore.

At this time, Jia Wenkai and Jia Jianping, who were in the water, had both lost their strength and sunk to the bottom. Jia Cuntai, who was not a good swimmer, was also exhausted. He knew he no longer had the strength to save both Jia Jianping and Jia Wenkai. Facing the two children struggling in the water, he thought his son was a tall man of 1.8 meters, who could hold out for a while. So, with all his might, he dove down and pulled Jia Jianping from the bottom of the water to the shore.

Jia Jianping was saved!

Jia Cuntai, who had been struggling in the water for nearly half an hour, was now pale-faced and weak-limbed from exhaustion and water inhalation. When he threw himself into the water to save his son, who had already sunk to the bottom, he found he couldn't dive down...

When the villagers rushed to pull Jia Wenkai from the water, the boy had stopped breathing. At that time, he was only 18 years old.

Two Generations of Sacrifice

Jia Cuntai, this Communist Party member with nearly 20 years of Party membership, chose to save others first when his son and another person were both in mortal danger. His deeds moved people to tears. In fact, his numerous ordinary deeds over the past decade or so were equally moving!

Fifteen years ago, Jia Cuntai, who had just entered his prime, took on the responsibility of being the Party Branch Secretary of Qiaotou Village. What was Qiaotou Village like at that time? Thousands of acres of farmland were all on the slopes, and the soil was just bare rock. The villagers had to struggle to get water. The thousand-plus villagers all looked to Jia Cuntai, hoping he could lead them to a better life. Jia Cuntai told everyone, "You all trust me, so I'll be your old yellow cow, working hard to pull you all to a better life."

The village lacked water for people and livestock, so Jia Cuntai decided to dig wells first. However, for generations, no one in the village had ever dug a well with water. No one was willing to waste their effort. Jia Cuntai led his wife and daughter to start the work first. The villagers were moved by his sincerity and also came to the construction site to work. After three months of hard work, they finally dug a well with abundant and sweet water. Then, he led everyone to continue working hard, digging three more wells, and installing water pumps for each well. The clear spring water flowed through the pipes to every household's kitchen, and the villagers finally no longer had to worry about water.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the wave of commodity economy swept through the sleepy mountain village and also stirred Jia Cuntai's heart. He wanted the villagers to get rich as soon as possible. He heard that Zhejiang's Ruian produced a type of weaving machine that was cheap and had a market for its products. He took the village's only 10,000 yuan and boarded a southbound train. He went to Ruian and back, spending less than 100 yuan. The sound of the plastic weaving bag factory's machines started up. The villagers earned a considerable income from the factory every year, but who knew how much effort Jia Cuntai had put into this factory!

Jia Cuntai's selfless dedication deeply influenced his son, Jia Wenkai. There was an elderly man in the village, Jia Wenlu, who was a veteran of the Korean War. His wife had been paralyzed for years, and he had no children. During the busy seasons of spring and autumn, the old man could take care of the fields but not the home. Jia Wenkai heard about this and helped the old man with his work for several busy seasons in a row.

Jia Wenkai was a good boy and a good student. From the first grade, he had always been the class monitor. Because of his excellent academic performance and conduct, he was honored to join the Communist Youth League at the age of 15.

Last summer, Jia Wenkai was admitted to Laizhou City's Tenth Middle School. From the first day he stepped into the school, he silently dedicated everything he had with the noble character of a Communist Youth League member: when the school's doors, windows, and podiums were broken, he would find tools to fix them quietly; the school's well was too deep, making it difficult for teachers to draw water, so he would find a few classmates to deliver water to the teachers' homes and offices after lunch and during extracurricular activities; his family's life was relatively difficult, but whenever he heard that a classmate was short of meal tickets, he would always lend a helping hand...

After Jia Wenkai was elected class monitor, if a classmate was sick, he would actively seek medical treatment and deliver meals; if a classmate was sick at home, he would visit and comfort them, help them catch up on their studies; he also organized mutual help and learning activities in the class.

At the end of 1987, the first-year class was evaluated as the only "civilized class" in the entire school.

"We Are All Your Children"

The heroic deed of Jia Cuntai and Jia Wenkai in saving others at the cost of their own lives was understood and respected by the entire society. After Jia Wenkai's death, many people from the surrounding villages came to express their condolences. A worker from the county fertilizer factory heard that Jia Cuntai was short of fertilizer for the autumn planting season and voluntarily bought five bags of fertilizer and sent them to Jia Cuntai's home. The more than 30 classmates from Jia Wenkai's former class heard that the class monitor's family's contracted peanut field had not been harvested yet, so they came to Qiaotou Village as a group to help Jia Cuntai dig up and carry the peanuts back home. The students told Jia Cuntai and his wife, "Uncle and Aunt, Wenkai is gone, but we are all your children."

　　听到呼救声，儿子不习水性跳下水
    救出两少年，父亲却失去了亲生子
    英雄父子
    元旦刚过，中共山东省烟台市委作出决定：授予莱州市程郭乡桥头村党支部书记贾存泰“模范共产党员”称号，追认其子、１８岁的共青团员贾文凯为中国共产党正式党员，并号召全市党团员和干部群众学习这一对“英雄父子”。
    　　　　面对生死选择
    １９８８年７月２５日中午，山东莱州市程郭乡桥头村党支部书记贾存泰一家四口正在自己承包的果园里锄草、喷药。天气炎热。贾存泰的长子、共青团员贾文凯到附近水库洗了几个甜瓜正往回走，忽听“扑通”、“扑通”两声响，回头一看，刚才还在水库边嬉戏打闹的本村两位少年贾建平、王英光落水了！只见这两个１５岁的孩子在水里拚命挣扎，高喊救命。
    见此情景，贾文凯扔掉甜瓜，向水库跑去。他忘了自己不习水性，衣服未脱，眼镜未摘，就跳进水里向王英光扑去。他用尽全力，将王英光推向岸边，回头又去救贾建平。正在挣扎的贾建平死死抱住贾文凯不放，此时，劳累了一上午的贾文凯精疲力尽。他拚命往外推贾建平，但无济于事……
    就在贾文凯拚命抢救贾建平的时候，贾存泰听到呼救声，撂下农具，直冲下山来。跑到水库边时，只见被贾文凯从深水中推向岸边的王英光，又滑进了深水。
    此时此刻，贾文凯和贾建平、王英光同时在水中挣扎，呼救声揪心撕肺。
    贾存泰这位普通的共产党员，首先扑向王英光。他用力把王英光从深水推向岸边，正要回头，惊慌中的王英光又一次从岸边滑进深水。贾存泰深吸一口气，再一次扑过去，用尽全力，把他推到岸上。
    这时，正在水中的贾文凯和贾建平都因无力挣扎而沉到了水底。水性不好的贾存泰也已精疲力尽，他知道自己已没有能力把建平和文凯都救出水来，面对正在水中挣扎的两个孩子，他觉得儿子是个１．８米的高个子，能顶一阵，于是用尽气力，沉下去，把贾建平从水底下拉出来，送上岸。
    贾建平得救了！
    在水中搏斗了近半个小时的贾存泰，连累带呛，此时已面色苍白，四肢无力。当他不顾一切地扑向水里，要去救自己那早已沉入水底的儿子的时候，却怎么也沉不下去了……
    当村里群众赶来把贾文凯从水下捞上来时，孩子已停止了呼吸。此时，他年仅１８岁。
    　　　　两代人的奉献
    贾存泰，这位近２０年党龄的共产党员，在亲生儿子与别人同处在生死关头的时候，毅然先救别人，事迹催人泪下。其实，他十几年来那一件件平凡的事迹，又何尝不让人感动！
    １５年前，刚刚踏入而立之年的贾存泰，挑起了桥头村党支部书记的重任。当时的桥头村是个什么样呢？全村数千亩耕地，都挂在山坡上，擦破地皮就是光石板，村里人吃水贵似油。全村上千口人眼巴巴的看着贾存泰，希望他能带领大伙过上好日子。贾存泰对大伙说：“大伙信任俺，俺就给大伙当老黄牛，拚命也给大伙拉出个好日子来。”
    村里人畜缺水吃，贾存泰决心先打井。可是，村里几辈人都没有打出过有水的井，谁也不愿意出这份冤枉力。贾存泰领着妻子女儿，先干起来，村里人被他的诚心感动了，也纷纷来到了工地干起来。经过３个月的苦战，终于打出了一眼水又旺又甜的井。接着，他又带领大伙连续奋战，打出了３眼井，并且给每眼井都安上水泵。清清的泉水通过管道，流到了家家户户的锅台上，村里的百姓终于不再愁吃水了。　
    党的十一届三中全会以后，商品经济的浪潮冲击着沉睡的山村，也冲击着贾存泰的心，他多么想让村里的群众尽快富起来。听说浙江瑞安出一种编织机，价钱便宜，织出来的产品也有销路，他便把村里仅有的一万元钱拿出来，登上了南下的列车。到瑞安一去一回，他只花了不到１００元钱，塑料编织袋厂的机器声响起来了。村里人每年从厂里获得一笔可观的收入，可谁知道贾存泰为这个厂付出了多少心血！
    贾存泰无私的奉献精神深深地影响着儿子贾文凯。村里有位贾文录老人，是位参加过抗美援朝的老复员军人。他老伴，长年瘫痪在坑上，身边又无儿无女，每到三夏三秋大忙季节，老人顾了地里，顾不了家里。贾文凯听说后，连续几个农忙季节，都去帮助老人干活。
    贾文凯是个好孩子，也是个好学生。他从上一年级起，就一直任班长。因品学兼优，１５岁就光荣加入了共青团。
    去年夏天，贾文凯考入了莱州市第十中学。从踏进校门的第一天起，他就以一个共青团员的高尚情操，默默地奉献着自己的一切：学校的门窗、讲台坏了，他找来工具悄悄修好；学校的井太深，老师打水有困难，他每天午饭后和课外活动时间，找几个同学把水送到老师的家里和办公室里；他自家生活比较困难，但一听说哪位同学饭票不够了，总是伸出援助之手……
    贾文凯当选班长后，班里的同学病了，他主动求医送药，打水送饭：有的同学因病在家休息，他登门探望、安慰，帮助补习功课；他还在班里开展互帮互学活动。
    １９８７年底，高一班被评为全校唯一的“文明班”。
    　　　　“我们都是您的孩子”
    贾存泰、贾文凯父子舍己救人的英雄行为，得到了整个社会的理解和敬佩。贾文凯死后，周围村很多人登门表示安慰。有位在县化肥厂工作的工人，听说贾存泰秋种缺化肥，主动帮买了五袋化肥，送到贾存泰家里。贾文凯生前所在班的３０多名同学听说班长家里责任田的花生还没有收，他们就集体来到桥头村，帮助贾存泰刨完搬回家。同学们对贾存泰夫妇说：“大叔、大婶，文凯不在了，我们都是您的孩子。”
