The Imbalanced Structure

	Reporter Liu Guilian
	The State Council's 9 ministries and 24 provinces and municipalities were, to varying degrees, drawn into the silk cocoon war last year. The reporter went to Sichuan Province to investigate the impact and troubles brought by the "silk cocoon war" to the silk industry. One

	Nanchong is a major silk cocoon producing area in Sichuan Province, and it is also home to several large silk factories. The Nanchong Second Silk Factory, praised by international peers as the "largest silk reeling factory in the world," is a factory with 4,000 employees, nearly 80 years of history, and first-class equipment, specializing in the production of export silk and silk products. Factory director Liang Wenbin told the reporter that after the silk cocoon war, the supply of raw materials was no longer guaranteed, and the factory has been in a state of "waiting for rice to cook" or even "no rice to cook." In 1988, the entire factory was short of 150 tons of dry cocoons, meaning it had to stop production for half a month. In the first half of 1989, it is uncertain how many cocoons can be allocated.

	Silk cocoons are reeled into silk, and silk is woven into silk. Now let's talk about the Nanchong Silk Weaving Factory. This factory, which is the top foreign exchange earner in Sichuan Province, had to stop production in parts after the silk supply was cut off, and eventually faced a complete shutdown. The factory sends cars to silk factories every day to "roam around," often only able to get a hundred or so pounds of silk, while the factory consumes 2.5 tons of silk per day. Each day of shutdown results in 35,000 meters of silk not being woven, and $50,000 in foreign exchange earnings lost.

	In Chengdu, the manager of the Chengdu Silk Company told the reporter that the biggest victim of the silk cocoon war in Sichuan is Chengdu. Chengdu's silk industry relies on 95% of its raw materials from various counties, and the impact of the "silk cocoon war" has made the raw material supply here lose its foundation. The Chengdu Shu Brocade Factory is a key enterprise with complete production facilities and strong technical strength, and its products are popular in Western Europe, North America, Hong Kong, Macau, and Southeast Asia. Now, the planned raw material quota for the factory can only be purchased at 10%. The factory's famous product, soft satin bedding, has been cut, and the flash satin bedding has been set aside. The few ethnic minority products and traditional Shu Brocade that are listed as must-preserve items can only be woven intermittently.

	To protect the foreign exchange-earning enterprises, some regions had to resort to administrative orders: silk factories must guarantee the silk supply plan, otherwise, the supply of cocoons will be stopped, and electricity will be rationed; for counties that do not hand over cocoons, in addition to disciplinary actions, the financial subsidy quota for the county will also be deducted. Two

	According to relevant officials in Sichuan Province, Sichuan produced 10,000 tons of silk in 1988, exported 3,000 tons of silk, and used 4,000 tons of silk for weaving. In theory, these 10,000 tons of silk should not only meet the needs of the province but also be able to sell some to other provinces. Why has silk suddenly become so scarce?

	Price imbalances have led to serious imbalances within the silk industry.

	From cocoons to silk, and from silk to silk fabric, the price should normally increase with each step. However, due to various reasons, the prices of cocoons, silk, and silk fabric have become distorted, making the price of silk not only much higher than that of cocoons but also higher than that of silk fabric (raw silk fabric). Exporting 1 ton of silk can fetch over 200,000 yuan, while exporting 1 ton of silk woven into raw silk fabric still does not fetch this price. As a result, everyone is increasingly focusing on silk, making silk the true "queen of fibers."

	It is more profitable to set up a silk factory to reel silk than to sell cocoons. No one wants to let the profits flow away, so various places have rushed to set up silk factories. The national annual cocoon production is 7 million piculs, but the current silk reeling capacity has exceeded 10 million piculs. In the past three years, Sichuan's cocoon production has only increased by 10%, while the processing capacity has doubled. The province requires the closure of 27 factories, but none have been closed.

	Market prices have a kind of "magic" over the direction of goods. The price of silk determines its value.

	The first destination of silk is no longer the factory for weaving silk fabric, but the market for competing exports. Special economic zones and coastal regions can buy silk for export at nearly double the regulated price, which has caused a large amount of silk to flow out of Sichuan. For a period of time, whether it is the silk industry or non-silk industry, local or foreign, with or without backing, openly or secretly, production departments or trade departments, everyone has joined the silk grab, and some have even used military trucks and planes. Despite the State Council's notices, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade's regulations, the Price Bureau and the Industrial and Commercial Bureau's "orders," provincial documents, and law enforcement inspections, it is still difficult to effectively control the resale of silk.

	The silk cocoon war is actually a silk grab war, and people are competing to buy and sell silk.

	Silk is in high demand, and its price continues to rise in competition, taking away the reasonable price that the silk weaving industry can digest, making silk fabric trend towards decline, and high-end silk, which requires investment in funds and technology to create higher added value, is even more shrinking. Three

	The silk cocoon war has brought difficulties to the silk industry and left room for thought.

	Why are cocoons, silk, and silk fabric out of proportion? Why is silk particularly in high demand? Is it normal for silk to be so in demand, is it a good thing, a bad thing, or a mix of both? How to adjust the relationship between the three?

	On the one hand, technologically advanced, well-equipped, and management-experienced large factories are in a state of "no rice to cook" or "waiting for rice to cook," while a batch of silk reeling factories using manual, fire-heated methods from the 1920s and backward silk weaving factories are on the rise, showing a thriving trend. On the one hand, factories with good production conditions are worried about the price increase of raw materials, while on the other hand, factories with very poor production conditions have plenty of high-quality, low-priced raw materials to enjoy. How to correct this inverted phenomenon?

	From the situation in Sichuan, on the one hand, factory directors are calling out for raw materials, on the other hand, raw materials are being "passed around" in the circulation sector. How to solve this problem? Cocoons, silk, and silk fabric are a systematic project. To eliminate the silk cocoon war and make cocoons, silk, and silk fabric develop in coordination, the key is still to formulate practical policies and truly coordinate the interests of each link and aspect of cocoons, silk, and silk fabric.

    失衡的结构
    本报记者　刘桂莲
    国务院的9个部和24个省市，在去年曾不同程度地被卷入蚕茧大战。记者就此到四川省采访，观察“蚕茧大战”对丝绸生产带来的冲击和困扰。　一
    南充地区是四川省蚕茧主要产地，这里也集中了一些大丝绸厂。被国际同行赞为“世界缫丝业大厂之最”的南充第二丝绸厂，是一个有4000名职工、近80年历史、一流设备的生产出口丝及丝织品的专业厂。厂长梁文炳告诉记者，蚕茧大战后，原料供应失去了保证，该厂一直处于“等米下锅”以至“无米下锅”的状况。1988年全厂缺150多吨干茧，意味着一个半月时间无茧停产。1989年上半年能调进多少茧，心中无底。
    茧缫丝，丝织绸。再说南充织绸厂。这个四川省创汇第一大户，则因丝供应不上，去年在局部停产之后，出现全面停产。厂里天天派车到丝厂“周游”，常常只能得到百十斤的丝，而该厂日耗丝为2.5吨。每停产一天，减少织绸3.5万米，少创汇5万美元。
    在成都，市丝绸公司经理告诉记者，蚕茧大战在四川最大的受害者要算成都。成都丝绸业原料95％靠各地县，“蚕茧大战”的冲击，使这里的原料供应失去了依托。成都蜀锦厂是拥有完备的生产手段和雄厚技术力量的骨干企业，产品畅销西欧、北美、港澳和东南亚。如今，计划下达的原料指标该厂只能购到10％。无奈该厂的名牌产品软缎被面砍了，闪光被面也搁置一旁。列入必保的少数民族用品和传统蜀锦也只能时停时织。
    为保出口创汇大户，一些地区不得不采取行政命令：丝厂要保证供丝计划，否则，将停止供茧，限量供电；对不交茧的市的有关人员，除执行党纪、政纪处分，还将扣减该县吃财政补贴的指标。　二
    据四川省有关同志介绍，四川1988年产丝1万多吨，出口丝3000吨，织绸用丝4000吨。按说这1万多吨丝不但能满足本省需要，还可以销给其它省一部分。为什么丝一下子变得这么紧张呢？
    价格失衡，导致了丝绸业内部结构的严重失衡。
    由茧而丝，由丝而绸，一个比一个价高，才属正常。可是，由于种种原因，茧、丝、绸之间形成价格的扭曲，使丝价不但大大高于茧，也高于绸（坯绸）。出口1吨丝可卖20多万元，而出口用1吨丝织成的坯绸，还卖不到这个价。于是，大家越来越把注意力集中到丝上，丝成了名副其实的“皇后纤维”。
    自己办丝厂缫丝，比卖茧划算得多。谁也不愿肥水流走，各地便纷纷办丝厂。全国年产茧700万担，可现在的缫丝能力已超过1000万担。3年来，四川的蚕茧仅增加10％，加工能力则翻了一番，省里要求关掉27个厂子，可一个也不见关。
    市场价格对商品走向具有一种“魔力”。丝的价格决定了丝的身价。
    丝的第一去处再也不是进入工厂织绸，而是进入流通竞相出口。特区和沿海地区的抢购者，可以出比规定价高出将近1倍的钱买丝出口，这就使四川的丝大批流走。在一段时间里，无论是丝绸行业的还是非丝绸行业的，本地的外地的，有后台的没后台的，明的暗的，生产部门的贸易部门的，都投身到抢丝的旋涡，有的甚至动用了军车、飞机。尽管有国务院的通知，经贸委的规定，物价局、工商局的“指令”，省里的文件，执法部门的检查，也难有效地控制丝的倒卖。
    蚕茧大战，实际是抢丝大战，人们争购又竞销的是丝。
    丝走俏，丝价在竞争中一涨再涨，夺走了织绸业能够消化的合理价格，使绸趋于衰退，需要投入资金、技术才能创造更高附加值的高档绸更趋萎缩。　三
    蚕茧大战给丝绸业带来了困难，也留下了思考。
    茧、丝、绸三者为什么比例失调，丝为什么特别走俏？丝如此走俏正常还是不正常，是喜、是忧，还是喜忧参半？如何调整这三者的关系？
    一方面技术先进、设备优良、管理经验丰富的大厂处于无米下锅或等米下锅的境地，而一批20年代作坊式手摇火烤的土法缫丝厂和设备落后的织绸厂却在兴起，显示方兴未艾架势。一方面生产条件好的工厂为消化不了原料涨价因素而犯愁，一方面生产条件十分差的工厂则有充分的优质低价原料享用。如何纠正这种倒置现象？
    从四川情况看，一方面厂长为原料呼天唤地，叫苦不迭，一方面原料却在流通领域“击鼓传花”，倒来倒去，怎样解决这个问题？茧、丝、绸，是个系统工程。消除蚕茧大战，使茧、丝、绸协调发展，关键还是在于制订切实的政策，把茧丝绸各个环节，各个方面的利益真正协调好。
