A company in Dandong was defrauded of 1.86 million yuan in goods payments. Recently, the Dandong Municipal Party Committee and the Dandong Municipal Government decided to remove all party and administrative positions held by Sun Maoxiang, the general manager of the Dandong Industrial Development Corporation, and to reduce his salary by one grade.

In May 1986, the Dandong Industrial Development Corporation signed a contract with individuals claiming to be from the Dongfang Supply and Marketing Corporation under the Heilongjiang Provincial State Farm Bureau. These individuals were Guan Mingcai (who was actually a farmer from Guangyuan, Sichuan Province, with a history of wandering in Heilongjiang Province) and Zhao Yong (who was actually a released criminal with no occupation). The contract was for the purchase of 10,000 tons of "bean cake fragments" at a total price of 6.1 million yuan. The Dandong Industrial Development Corporation paid 20% of the total price, amounting to 1.2 million yuan, as a down payment. After the payment, there was no sign of the goods being delivered for a long time. However, Sun Maoxiang, the general manager of the purchasing party, remained unaware and signed another contract with the fraudsters for the supply of 1,040 units of "Feicai" brand 46cm color televisions. Although the contract stipulated that the goods would be delivered upon receipt of payment, the Development Corporation sent 480 units of color televisions worth 667,000 yuan to the other party without receiving the payment, resulting in another fraud. The two transactions totaled 1.86 million yuan in losses. Despite prolonged efforts to recover the funds, more than 900,000 yuan remain unrecovered.

　　丹东一公司巨额货款被骗
    总经理受到撤职降薪处分
    新华社沈阳２月２８日电  丹东市实业开发总公司１８６万元货款被骗走。前不久，中共丹东市委、丹东市人民政府决定撤销这家公司总经理孙茂祥党内外一切职务，并降一级工资。
    １９８６年５月间，丹东市实业开发总公司与自称是黑龙江省国营农场总局东方供销公司经理的贯明才（实际上是长期流窜黑龙江省的四川省广元市农民）、业务主任赵勇（实际是刑满释放的无业人员）签订了购买１万吨“豆饼碎”的合同。总价款６１０万元，丹东市实业开发总公司先付给对方２０％，即１２０万元作为定金。付款后，很久没见发货。但作为买方总经理的孙茂祥毫无警觉，竟然又同这伙骗子签订了１０４０台“飞彩”牌４６厘米彩电的供销合同。本来合同规定对方款到才付货，而开发总公司未见货款，就把价值６６．７万元的４８０台彩电发给了对方，致使再次上当受骗。两笔生意总共被骗１８６万元，经长期追索，至今尚有９０余万元尚未追回。
