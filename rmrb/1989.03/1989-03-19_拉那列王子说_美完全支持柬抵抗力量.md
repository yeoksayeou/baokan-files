Prince Ranariddh Says U.S. Fully Supports Cambodian Resistance Forces

	New York, March 17 (Reported by Liu Kai Chen) -- Prince Ranariddh, son of Prince Norodom Sihanouk, chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, announced at a press conference here today that the U.S. government has expressed "full support" for the Cambodian resistance forces.

	Prince Ranariddh is the commander-in-chief of the Sihanoukist National Army and has recently visited the United States as a personal representative of Sihanouk. He emphasized that the visit has achieved positive results.

	Prince Ranariddh said that on March 13, he was received by President Bush in Washington. During the meeting, Bush expressed support for them and said that the U.S. would continue to pressure the Soviet Union to force Vietnamese troops to withdraw from Cambodia, allowing the Cambodian people to exercise self-determination.

	Prince Ranariddh also said that he met with officials from the State Department and the Department of Defense, as well as members of Congress in Washington, all of whom expressed support for the Cambodian resistance forces. The U.S. government has decided to increase the "non-military aid" for the Cambodian resistance forces from $5 million to $7 million for the current fiscal year.

	Prince Ranariddh added that he raised the issue of military aid during the talks, but did not receive a "clear and positive response." He said, "Our troops have not received any weapons aid from the United States."

　　拉那列王子说
    美完全支持柬抵抗力量
    本报联合国３月１７日电  记者刘开宸报道：民柬主席西哈努克亲王之子拉那列王子今天在这里举行的记者招待会上宣布，美国政府对他表示“完全支持”柬埔寨抵抗力量。
    拉那列王子是西哈努克民族主义军总司令，做为西哈努克的私人代表，最近来美国访问。他强调这次访问取得了积极的成果。
    拉那列王子说，他１３日在华盛顿受到总统布什接见。布什在会谈中表示美国支持他们，并将继续对苏联施加压力，迫使越南军队撤出柬埔寨，让柬埔寨人民行使自决权。
    拉那列王子说，他还在华盛顿会见了国务院和国防部官员以及国会议员，他们都表示支持柬埔寨抵抗力量。美国政府决定本财政年度给柬抵抗力量的“非军事援助”从５００万美元增加到７００万美元。
    拉那列王子还说，他在会谈中提出了军援要求，但未得到“明确和积极的响应”，“我们的军队一直没有得到美国的武器援助”。
