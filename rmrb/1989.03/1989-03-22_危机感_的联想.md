Title: Associations with the "Sense of Crisis"

The book "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" by Paul Kennedy, a professor at Yale University in the United States, sparked intense debate upon its publication last year.

Kennedy believes that economic strength is the core factor of a nation's power. He argues that the United States, due to excessive military spending, is economically declining compared to other major Western countries. In response to Kennedy's views, Samuel P. Huntington, director of the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University, published an article in the winter issue of "Foreign Affairs" last year titled "The U.S. — Decline or Renewal?" He contends that the United States' share of the world's gross national product reaching 50% after World War II was a unique situation caused by the international political and economic climate at the time. Now, with the share reduced to around 20%, the situation has returned to normal. Since many aspects of the United States' strength are at the forefront globally, the possibility of the United States declining is less than that of other major powers.

Following this, "The Wall Street Journal" published an article by reporter Carl E. Haus in late January, based on interviews conducted worldwide. The article supports Huntington's views, asserting that the 21st century will still be "the American Century."

The author does not intend to join this American debate but believes that some beneficial insights and lessons can be drawn from the arguments presented by Huntington and Haus.

Huntington believes that the national strength of the United States includes "population size and education, natural resources, economic development, social cohesion, political stability, military strength, ideological appeal, diplomatic alliances, and technological achievements." Haus argues that "strength comes from the combination of military, political, economic, and cultural forces, including the intangible factors that make a nation admired and respected." This can be considered a relatively comprehensive description of a country's overall strength.

Regardless of the perspective, the United States is still one of the leading economic and military powers in the world today. However, the fact that such a country has developed a sense of impending decline, which has garnered nationwide attention and sparked intense debate, is itself worth pondering. Huntington also mentioned a psychological factor among the American public. He said, "As long as the American public periodically believes that it is on the verge of decline, the United States is unlikely to decline." A crisis may not be a good name, but a sense of crisis can be a driving force for people to strive forward, which seems to be a good thing. As the saying goes, "Adversity breeds success, while ease leads to ruin."

The author believes that these points indicate that in today's world, for a country or a nation to revitalize its strength and strive for progress, in addition to possessing power, having a sense of crisis and national will in the national psyche is not a bad thing. This drives people to make balanced and coordinated efforts in all aspects that constitute national strength. The stones from other mountains can be used to sharpen our jade. These are areas we can learn from.

Another point worth noting is that when Huntington discussed challenges to the United States, he mentioned the European Economic Community, Japan, and the Soviet Union. Haus also mentioned China. However, Haus said that from now until about 30 years later, "China will basically remain a backward, overpopulated Third World country." This statement may not be pleasant to hear, but we cannot deny that this assessment seems objective. However, this also leads the author to wonder: since China is in this situation, why do some Westerners keep making a fuss about China's family planning and Tibet issues, constantly criticizing us for this and that, as if they would only be satisfied if China did not implement family planning, allowing the population to continue to grow uncontrollably, or if Tibet returned to its past slave society. Could this be a clever strategic maneuver to hinder China's development? Let's hope this thought is an overreaction.

### “危机感”的联想

　　“危机感”的联想
    塞北
    美国耶鲁大学教授保罗·肯尼迪所著《大国的兴衰》一书在去年出版以后，在美国引起了激烈的争论。
    肯尼迪认为，经济实力是一个国家的实力的中心因素。美国由于为军事目的花钱太多，同其他西方主要国家相比，经济上正在衰落。针对肯尼迪的论点，哈佛大学国际事务研究中心主任塞维尔·亨廷顿在《外交》季刊去年冬季号上发表一篇文章：《美国是衰落还是复兴》，展开辩论。他认为，战后美国在世界国民生产总值中所占份额达到５０％，是当时国际政治经济形势造成的一种特殊状况，目前降到只占２０％左右，则是进入了正常状态。由于美国构成实力的许多方面在世界上都名列前茅，因此美国衰落的可能性小于其他大国。
    接着，《华尔街日报》在１月下旬发表了该报记者卡·埃·豪斯在全世界进行采访以后写的一篇报道，支持亨廷顿的观点，认为２１世纪“仍将是美国的世纪”。
    笔者无意参预美国这一场辩论，但认为从亨廷顿和豪斯提出的论据中可得到一些有益的启示和借鉴。
    亨廷顿认为，美国的国家力量包括“人口规模和教育、自然资源、经济发展、社会凝聚力、政治稳定、军事实力、意识形态的吸引力、外交联盟以及技术上的成就”。豪斯认为，“实力产生于军事、政治、经济和文化力量的结合，其中包括使一个民族受到赞美和尊重的无形的东西。”这大概可说是对于一个国家的综合实力的比较完整的概述。
    不管从哪方面来说，美国在今天的世界上总还算得上数一数二的经济、军事强国。而在这样的国家里，居然产生了衰落与否的忧患意识，并且受到全国范围的关注而能发起一场激烈的争论，这本身就值得我们深思。亨廷顿还提到了美国公众的一种心理因素。他说，“只要美国公众定期地相信快要衰落了，美国就不大可能衰落。”危机似乎不是一种好的名字，但危机感却是激发人们奋勇向前的力量，这又似乎是件好事情。正所谓“生于忧患而死安乐”。
    笔者认为，这些论点表明，在当前世界上，一个国家、一个民族要振兴国力，奋发图强，除了需要具有实力外，在民族心理上有“危机感”、有“民族意志”并不是坏事，从而促使人们从构成国家实力的各个方面作出平衡协调的努力。他山之石，可以攻玉。这些都是我们可以借鉴的地方。
    还值得我们注意的，亨廷顿在谈到对美国的挑战的时候，提到了欧洲经济共同体、日本和苏联。豪斯则还提到了中国。不过豪斯说，从现在起大约３０年内，“中国基本上仍然是一个落后的、人口过多的第三世界国家”。对于我们来说，这句话有点不大中听，但不能否认，这个估计看来是客观的。不过由此笔者也不禁联想到，既然中国是这样一种情况，为什么西方一些人在中国实行计划生育和西藏问题上总是不断大作文章，无端指责我们这也不对，那也不对，似乎中国不搞计划生育，使人口不断膨胀，或者让西藏回到过去的奴隶社会他们才心里舒服。这会不会是给中国的发展拖后腿的一种巧妙的战略迂回行动呢？但愿这个想法是一种过虑。
