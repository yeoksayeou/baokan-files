Ten years ago, when magpies, undeterred by the bustling noise of the city, flew to Nanjing's most bustling area, Xinjiekou, and insisted on building nests and settling on the branches of tall French plane trees, people couldn't help but feel delighted.

As the saying goes, "When magpies chatter, good news is coming." The harbingers of spring suddenly settled in Xinjiekou, which was undoubtedly a good omen for Nanjing's greening efforts. Sure enough, in the ten years since, amidst the chattering of magpies, Nanjing's greening efforts have indeed brought one piece of good news after another:

On March 12, 1979, over 100,000 cadres and masses in Nanjing walked out of their offices, streets, factories, and schools to plant 450,000 trees in one go. Since then, every Arbor Day, tens of thousands of people across the city have taken to the streets, and this has become a tradition.

In May 1984, the Nanjing Municipal Committee of Gulou District reported to the central authorities that over 30,000 young people in the city had established 320 "Youth Green Islands" on 25 kilometers of main roads and 140,000 square meters of safety islands, receiving praise from central leaders.

In April 1986, the city planted over 50,000 trees and flowers, including azaleas, camellias, golden raisins, yellow thorns, flowering pomegranates, and osmanthus, along 13 main streets in one go.

Ten years of planting trees, benefiting future generations. Compared to ten years ago, Nanjing's greening coverage rate has increased from 29.97% to 37.1%; the per capita public green space has also increased from 3.4 to 7.5 square meters. Standing on a high place and looking down at the entire city, it truly is "a thousand acres of green within the city, a thousand colors of mountains outside the city; tall buildings surround green trees, people are in a painting." No wonder outsiders praise Nanjing's streets as "green corridors," and local residents proudly say, "No need for umbrellas in the rain, no need for hats in the sun"!

The director of Nanjing's Municipal Bureau of Parks mysteriously told me that the pair of magpies that chattered on the branches at Xinjiekou have had offspring. Their descendants have long since built new nests on the tall roadside trees near the South Nanjing Military Region General Hospital on Jiefang Road.

　　喜鹊闹枝新街口
    江苏  杨明照
    １０年前，当喜鹊不顾闹市区车水马龙的喧嚣，双双飞到南京最繁华的新街口，执意在街头高大的法国梧桐枝头筑巢定居时，人们无不喜形于色。
    俗话说，喜鹊叫，喜事到。报春的天使突然定居新街口，这对古城南京的绿化工作来说，无疑是个好兆头。果不其然。转眼１０年过去，在喜鹊的喳喳闹声中，南京的绿化工作，真的传出了一个又一个喜讯：
    １９７９年３月１２日，南京１０万多干部群众走出机关、街道、工厂、学校，一次植树４５万株。此后，每到植树节，全市都有数万人走上街头并已形成制度。
    １９８４年５月，南京市鼓楼区委向中央汇报全市３万多青年在城区２５公里长，面积为１４万平方米的干道安全岛上，建立“青年绿岛”３２０多个的情况，受到中央领导同志的赞扬。
    １９８６年４月，全市在１３条主要街道一次就栽种杜鹃、山茶花、金丝桃、黄刺梨、花石榴、广玉兰等花木５万多株。
    十年树木，造福后人。和１０年前相比，如今南京的绿化覆盖率已从２９．９７％，上升为３７．１％；人均公共绿地面积，也从３．４增加到７．５平方米。站在高处鸟瞰全城，真个“城中千顷绿，城外千山色；高楼绕翠树，人在画图中”。难怪外地游人夸赞南京街道是“绿色甬道”，而本地群众以“雨不打洋伞，晴不戴草帽”引以自豪！
    南京市园林局的林局长神秘地告诉我，那对闹枝新街口的喜鹊已有了后代。它们的子孙并早就在解放路南京军区总医院附近的高大行道树上，又垒起了新窝……
