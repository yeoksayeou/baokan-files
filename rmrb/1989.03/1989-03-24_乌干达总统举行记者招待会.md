Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni held a press conference at the Great Hall of the People this afternoon. He said he was very pleased to visit China and that this visit had been very successful.

He said that Uganda and China have great potential for cooperation, especially in the economic and trade sectors. Uganda is rich in natural resources but lacks technology, capital, and management experience. He hopes to receive assistance from China in these areas.

When discussing bilateral cooperation in agriculture, Museveni said that Uganda's climate is very suitable for farming. With irrigation projects, it is possible to plant four crops a year. He expressed his hope that both sides can achieve effective cooperation in this field.

　　乌干达总统举行记者招待会
    新华社北京３月２３日电乌干达总统约韦里·穆塞韦尼今天下午在人民大会堂举行的记者招待会上说，他很高兴到中国访问，这次访问非常成功。
    他说，乌干达同中国的合作有着很大潜力，特别是在经贸方面。乌干达自然资源很丰富，但是缺乏技术、资金和管理经验。他希望在这些方面得到中国的帮助。
    在谈到农业方面双边合作问题时，穆塞韦尼说，乌干达气候条件非常好，如果有水利工程灌溉农田，一年可以种四季农作物。他表示希望双方能在这一领域进行有成效的合作。
