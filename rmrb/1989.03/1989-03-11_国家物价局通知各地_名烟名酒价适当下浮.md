The State Pricing Bureau has recently notified various regions to appropriately reduce the prices of famous brands of cigarettes and liquor.

The notification states that since the prices of 13 brands of famous cigarettes and 13 brands of famous liquor were liberalized in July last year, the market situation has remained good, guiding production, adjusting supply and demand, and cracking down on the black market. Commercial inventories are ample, and market supply is abundant. However, due to the success of the state's control over the group consumption of famous cigarettes and liquor, some varieties have seen a significant increase in inventory recently. Therefore, the State Pricing Bureau has notified various regions to appropriately reduce the prices of famous cigarettes and liquor.

The notification provides guiding opinions on the specific reduction ranges for the prices of 13 brands of famous cigarettes and 13 brands of famous liquor: the wholesale prices of 13 brands of famous cigarettes in their production areas should be reduced by 5% to 10% based on the current prices, and some can be reduced more, while retail prices should be reduced by 10% to 15%; the retail prices of 13 brands of famous liquor should be reduced by 10% to 20% based on the current market retail prices. For regions that have already reduced prices in January this year, the reduction can be less this time; for places where retail prices are relatively high, the reduction can be more.

　　国家物价局通知各地
    名烟名酒价适当下浮
    新华社北京３月１０日电  国家物价局日前通知各地对名烟名酒价格适当向下浮动。
    通知指出，自去年７月放开１３种名烟和１３种名酒价格以来，烟酒市场形势一直是好的，指导了生产，调节了供求，打击了黑市。商业库存充足，市场供应丰富。但是由于国家控制名烟名酒的集团消费取得了成效，近来有些品种库存上升较多。据此，国家物价局通知各地适当下浮名烟名酒价格。
    通知对１３种名烟和１３种名酒价格的具体下浮幅度提出了指导性意见，即：１３种名烟的产地批发价格在现行基础上下浮５％至１０％，有的可多下浮一些，零售价下浮１０％至１５％；１３种名酒的零售价格在现行市场零售价的基础上下浮１０％至２０％。今年１月有的地区已经下浮过的，这次可以少下浮一些；零售价格偏高的地方可以多下浮一些。
