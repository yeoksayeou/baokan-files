Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 30th.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said today that China is deeply concerned about the recent situation in Lebanon.

He said: "The Chinese government and people are deeply concerned about the recent situation in Lebanon. We deeply sympathize with the tragic plight of the Lebanese people. We hope that all parties involved will prioritize the national interests of Lebanon, exercise restraint, cease military actions, cooperate with the mediation efforts of the Arab League, resolve disputes through negotiations, and achieve stability and reconciliation in Lebanon."

The spokesperson also commented today on a report by a foreign magazine regarding a large-scale arms deal between China and Iran, stating: "China has always taken a cautious and responsible attitude towards arms sales. Under the condition that the Iran-Iraq war has not yet ceased, China will not do anything detrimental to the reconciliation of Iran and Iraq. The report about China signing a large-scale arms deal with Iran is groundless."
