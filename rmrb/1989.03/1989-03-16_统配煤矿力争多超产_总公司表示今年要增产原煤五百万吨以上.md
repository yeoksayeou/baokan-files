Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 15th.

Facing the nationwide coal shortage, a responsible official from the China National Coal Industry Corporation today stated that the corporation aims to produce an additional 500 million to 800 million tons of raw coal this year on top of the planned 336.71 million tons, with an additional 200 million tons to be produced in the first quarter.

The China National Coal Industry Corporation oversees all state-run coal mines except those in Northeast China and the eastern part of Inner Mongolia, bearing the responsibility for more than three-quarters of the nation's state-run coal production. It is the primary coal supplier for economically developed regions such as East China and Central China. Currently, the corporation's coal mines are facing numerous challenges, including severe shortages of production and construction funds, electricity, steel, and timber, as well as an unstable workforce. However, the corporation, considering the national need for coal, has urged all its subordinate bureaus and mines to overcome these difficulties, mobilize workers, and resolutely fulfill the national plan, striving for increased production.

To ensure the achievement of the coal production target, 200 coal mine bureau and mining team leaders attending today's coal industry production meeting pledged to do their utmost to produce more coal and share the nation's difficulties.

　　统配煤矿力争多超产
    总公司表示今年要增产原煤五百万吨以上
    本报北京３月１５日讯  本报记者刘燮阳、新华社记者赵明亮报道：面对全国煤炭全面紧张的局面，中国统配煤矿总公司负责人今天表示，总公司今年要在保证完成３３６７１万吨原煤产量计划的基础上，力争再增产５００万吨至８００万吨，其中第一季度增产２００万吨。
    中国统配煤矿总公司管辖着除东北及内蒙古东部地区以外的所有统配煤矿，担负着全国３／４以上的统配煤炭生产任务，是华东、华中等经济发达地区的主要煤炭提供者。目前这个总公司所属煤矿尽管存在着生产建设资金十分紧张，电力、钢材、坑木供应缺口大，劳动力不稳定等许多困难。但是总公司从国家急需煤炭的大局出发要求所属各局矿千方百计克服困难，发动职工，坚决完成国家计划，力争多超产。
    为确保煤炭增产目标的实现，２００名煤矿局矿长及采煤队长在今天召开的煤炭工业生产会议上表示，一定尽全力增产更多的煤炭，分担国家困难。
