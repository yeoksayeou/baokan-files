Today in the afternoon, the tranquil and serene Beijing Guangji Temple was filled with incense smoke. The president of the Chinese Buddhist Association, Zhao Puji, along with hundreds of monks and representatives from the Buddhist Academy, gathered here to welcome the high Buddhist monk from Taiwan, Master Sheng Yun, and his delegation from the International Buddhist Progress Association, who came to propagate the Dharma and visit relatives.

The masters walked through the Hall of Heavenly Kings and arrived at the Great Hero Hall. Inside the hall, bells and drums rang out, and incense burned brightly. Hundreds of monks from both sides of the Taiwan Strait gathered together, chanting scriptures and praying for world peace and the happiness of the people.

Master Zhao Puji expressed his heartfelt respect and warm welcome to the high Buddhist monk from Taiwan, Master Sheng Yun, who is the founder of Foguangshan and the Foguangshan branch temple in the United States, and to the delegation propagating the Dharma and visiting relatives. He also presented Master Sheng Yun with a "Dragon Treasury"—a reprinted edition of the "Tripitaka" commissioned by the Qing Emperor Yongzheng and completed by the Qing Emperor Qianlong.

Master Sheng Yun, who left his hometown forty years ago, although residing in Taiwan and traveling abroad, has never forgotten his love for his homeland. He presented Master Zhao Puji with the "Foguang Tripitaka," the "Foguang Buddhist Dictionary," and the "Foguangshan 20th Anniversary Commemorative Album," and also donated a fund for propagating the Dharma to the Chinese Buddhist Association.

    众位大师走过天王殿，来到大雄宝殿。殿内，钟鼓齐鸣，香火鼎盛，海峡两岸数百僧众聚会一堂，齐诵经文，共同祈祷，愿世界和平，人民安乐。
    赵朴初大师对台湾佛光山开山大师和佛光山别院、美国西来寺创始人星云大师及弘法探亲团一行表示衷心敬意和热烈欢迎，并向星云大师赠送了“龙藏”——重印的清雍正皇帝创刊、乾隆皇帝刊成的《大藏经》。
