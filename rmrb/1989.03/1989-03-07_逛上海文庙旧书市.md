On a Sunday morning, the vibrant hues of the rising sun spread across the sky above the Arcane Star Pavilion in the Wenmiao Temple. This temple, built during the Qing Dynasty's Xianfeng era, had a crowd of eager "used book traders" gathered in front of its ancient gates. Some carried heavy travel bags, others dragged loaded carts, and some held torn cardboard boxes, all waiting for the two antique red doors to open.

The doors finally opened. They rushed in, each securing a favorable spot, unpacking their bags and boxes. After a flurry of activity, they neatly arranged their bundles of old books and magazines on rented small tables, categorizing them by type. Only then did they sit down to catch their breath, waiting for the "book enthusiasts" to arrive.

Soon, the grand Dacheng Hall and the 800-square-meter central plaza in front of it naturally formed six orderly "used book" aisles. The crowd grew denser, and from the high steps at the entrance, one could see the flow of people meandering through the six aisles. Gray hair mixed with black, short hair with long, footsteps swaying with the crowd, eyes scanning the bookstalls one by one. If they found something they liked, they would stop to ask, "How much for this book?" The seller might reply, "Three yuan." The buyer would then ask, "Can you make it two fifty?" The seller would answer, "Take it!" And so, everyone was happy, and the book changed hands.

This is the only used book "flea market" in Shanghai—the Wenmiao Used Book Market, a legal venue for individual used book trading. If you have extra books and magazines, you can pay two jiao for the entrance ticket and four jiao for the stall rental fee to start your "used book business." The variety of books here is vast, prices are negotiable, and you can browse freely, attracting thousands of "book lovers." Since its opening during the Spring Festival of 1986, it has sold 2,000 tickets and rented out over 200 stalls each time, becoming a very active venue for the circulation of used books in Shanghai and gaining a good reputation among Shanghai readers. Many scholars, teachers, editors, writers, and even more college students and young workers come here, despite the distance, becoming regular customers. The morning from 9 AM to 11 AM is the "golden time" for the book market, and the entire market is often packed with people.

　　逛上海文庙旧书市
    周日清晨，翻腾着的斑斓的朝霞在文庙魁星阁上空铺陈开去，这座建于清代咸丰年间的祭孔庙宇门前已簇拥着一群性急的“旧书交易者”。他们有的背着沉重的旅行包，有的拖着满载的小拖车，有的提着裂口的纸箱，等待着两扇古朴的红色大门打开。
    门终于打开了。他们蜂拥而入，各自占据有利地形，拉包开箱，好一阵忙碌，把一捆捆旧书刊分门别类陈列在租来的张张小书桌上，这才坐下身来，缓上口气，静候“淘书迷”的光顾。
    不一会儿，雄伟的大成殿前的走廊两侧和中央８００平方米的广场自然而然形成了六条整齐的“旧书”长廊。人逐渐多起来，从入口处高高的台阶上往前望去，只见人流在六条长廊中迂回运动，白发夹着黑发，短发伴着长发，脚步随着人流在徜徉，目光从书摊前一一扫过，偶有中意的，便驻步询问：“此书怎卖”？答：“三元”。又问“二元五？”答“拿去！”于是皆大欢喜，书归另主。
    这就是上海唯一的旧书“跳蚤市场”——文庙旧书集市，一个合法的个人旧书交易场所。
    如果你有多余的书刊，只要花上二角门票，四角摊位租费，便可以干起“旧书买卖”的营生。这里的书刊品种繁多，价格面议，随意翻阅，吸引了数以千计的“书迷”前往。自１９８６年春节开放以来，每次出售２０００张门票，出租２００多个摊位，为上海的旧书流通开辟了一个极为活跃的场所，在上海读者群中颇有名望。不少学者、教师、编辑、作家以及更多的大中学生和青工不怕路远慕名而来，成为这儿的常客。早晨９点到中午１１点是书市的“黄金时间”，整个书市常常水泄不通。
