Title: How to Treat Intellectuals

The vice president of the Central Party School, Gao Di, recently relayed a conversation from a central leader, stating that science and technology are the primary productive forces, and intellectuals should be elevated from the ninth position to the first (see *Shanghai Science and Technology News*, February 10). This reasoning is logical and without doubt; however, the issue is that in reality, being in the "first" position is not easy. When we discuss the issue of intellectuals, the focus seems to always be on housing, money, and cars, as if solving these problems would establish the "first position" (of course, these problems should be gradually resolved). But there is a significant oversight here: in how we view the issue of intellectuals, there are still many outdated thoughts and ideas causing obstacles, and there are many biases and misunderstandings. This may be the primary reason why many intellectuals are not content.

Honoring scholars is a tradition in China; we do not need to cite stories and sayings from books to illustrate this, as it is undoubtedly vivid and moving. However, it is precisely within this tradition that the great sorrow of intellectuals is concealed. Because throughout history, intellectuals have been consistently viewed as tools. They are intelligent and wise, and no one denies that their knowledge is a great treasure for stabilizing the country and achieving hegemony. Even illiterate brutes would not forget to invite a scholar to help with their strategies. The bias lies here: as Lu Xun said, intellectuals are either "helpers" or "idlers." The former are ready to be consulted on politics, while the latter are merely "entertainers" or jesters. I point out these historical facts to clarify a mistaken understanding: it is not because missiles need to go into space that we realize intellectuals are useful; it is not because we cannot operate computers that we think to invite a scholar to help; it is not because we lack good horses to pull the chariot that we particularly cherish the thousand-mile horse... The modernization we are undertaking and the so-called "achieving hegemony" are fundamentally different. It follows the call of progress and civilization, and thus it should and can integrate this great endeavor with intellectual civilization. In other words, what is perhaps more important than respecting knowledge is that the designers, organizers, and implementers of modernization should all become members of the intellectual community. In our emotions and vocabulary, we should eliminate humiliating thoughts and expressions like "utilizing the skills of intellectuals."

Sociologists unanimously discuss that intellectuals should be such a group: they bear the noble mission of exploration and criticism. Their creativity and constructiveness are precisely expressed through fulfilling this mission. The true value of intellectuals lies here. They may be incompetent as a copying and filing clerk, and they may have many personal flaws, but they cannot lack the spirit of exploration and criticism. In other words, they cannot lack curiosity about unknown realms and the passion to reform society and promote new life. If they lack this curiosity and passion, no matter how high their academic qualifications, the title of intellectual is not deserved. The reason for repeatedly defining intellectuals is simply to explain what intellectuals deserve the most respect for, and that is this. Obviously, at this time of great change in China, the old culture and old order are full of obstacles, while the new culture and new order are still being explored. It is a wise move to protect and even promote these excellent qualities of intellectuals, to elevate their spirit of exploration and courage of criticism.

Our party and government have already done some work to improve the living conditions of intellectuals, and we will do better in the future, but it is not a special welfare. Non-intellectuals also need housing, gas, and adequate water supply, and intellectuals will understand this. Because the sign of development is that more and more people become intellectuals, and there is no need to rank them. The reason we want to improve is that the true deep significance lies in forming such a culture, such a fashion, and such a social norm, where people sincerely respect those intellectuals who contribute their knowledge wealth to social progress. At that time, perhaps we will no longer need to discuss the issue of position.

### 如何对待知识分子

　　如何对待知识分子
    中央党校副校长高狄最近转述一位中央领导同志的谈话，说科学技术是第一生产力，知识分子应该从老九提到第一的位置（见《上海科技报》２月１０日）。这个推理合乎逻辑，没有疑义；可问题是，实际生活中，“第一”仍是不易。我们谈论知识分子问题时，兴奋点似乎总是房子、票子、车子，好像这些问题解决了，“第一位置”也就确立了（当然这些问题应该逐步解决）。但这里面有个很大的疏漏，这就是在怎样看待知识分子问题上，仍有很多陈腐思想和观念作梗，偏见误解在在多有。这也许是不少知识分子心情不舒畅最主要的原因。
    礼贤，在中国是有传统的；我们不必援引哪书本上记载的礼贤故事和格言，它生动和感人是无疑的。但恰在这之中掩盖着知识分子的巨大悲哀。因为在漫长的历史中，知识分子断无例外地被以器具视之，他们聪明、智慧，谁也不否认他们满脑子知识是安邦定国、成就霸业的巨大财富。即使目不识丁的莽汉也不会忘了请一位秀才借箸代谋。偏见正在这里，如鲁迅所说，知识分子要么“帮忙”，要么“帮闲”，前者以备问政垂询之需，后者则不过是“俳优蓄之”的弄臣。我指出这样的史实，意在廓清一种错误的认识：不是因为导弹要上天，才想到知识分子有用处；不是因为操作不了电脑，才想到请个秀才来帮忙；不是为的没有良骥驾辕，才特别厚爱千里马……我们所进行的现代化事业和所谓“成就霸业”有着根本的不同，它遵从进步和文明的召唤，因此完全应该也可以将这伟大的事业和知识文明溶为一体。也就是说，比尊重知识更重要的或许是，现代化建设的设计者、组织者和实施者都应该成为知识者的一员，在我们的情感和语汇中摒弃“利用知识分子一技之长”之类的令人感到屈辱的想法、说法。
    社会学家不约而同地谈到，知识分子应该是这样的群体：他们负有探索和批判等等崇高的使命。他们的创造性和建设性正是通过履行这种使命表现出来。知识分子的真正价值正在这里。他们可能是个不称职的抄抄写写的收发员，甚至可能有很多“做人”的缺点，但他们不能没有探索精神、批判精神。换句话说，他们不能没有对未知领域的好奇心，没有变革社会、催促新生的热情。如果没有这份好奇心和热情，不管他有多高学历，知识分子的称谓都是名不符实的。之所以喋喋不休地界说知识分子，无非是想说明，知识分子最值得尊重的是什么，就是这个。显然，值此中国新旧交替的大变革之际，旧的文化和旧的秩序壁垒重重，而新的文化和新的秩序尚在探索之中，加意保护乃至发扬知识分子这些优秀品质，使他们的探索精神和批判勇气高张大炽，无疑是明智之举。十年改革，如果没有解放思想、锐意开拓，以探索和批判精神贯彻其间，怎么可能使中国发生这样大的变化。
    我们的党和政府已经为改善知识分子生活待遇做了一些工作，今后还要做得更好，但不是一种特殊的福利。非知识分子和知识分子一样需要住房、煤气和充足的供水，这一点知识分子会想得通。因为发达的标志就是越来越多的人成为知识分子，不必排座次。我们之所以要改善，其真正深远的意义在于要形成这样一种文化、一种时尚、一种社会准则，就是人们心悦诚服地尊重那些以知识财富贡献于社会进步的知识分子。到了那时，也许就不必再谈位置问题了。
