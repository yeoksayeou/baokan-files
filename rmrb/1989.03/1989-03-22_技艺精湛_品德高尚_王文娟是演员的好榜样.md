Column: Letters to the Editor

Our town is located on a small island in the Yangtze River. Before the Spring Festival this year, the leaders of the town's theater invited the famous Yue opera actress Wang Wenjuan and others to perform. Wang Wenjuan agreed enthusiastically.

We originally planned to hire a few luxury cars to pick up the actors from Shanghai. However, Wang Wenjuan thought that this would be too expensive and politely declined. On the first day of the New Year, she and the other actors arrived by bus. At noon, she had a sandwich on the bus to satisfy her hunger. As soon as she got off the bus, Wang Wenjuan told the town's receptionists that she was there to perform and did not need any special treatment, and that her meals and accommodation should be simple. We arranged for her to stay in a standard three-person room, and she said it was fine. Due to the poor conditions, we felt embarrassed and prepared to move her to a larger hotel, but she refused no matter how we tried to persuade her.

On the second day of the New Year, the performance officially began. Due to bad weather, it rained continuously, affecting the audience turnout. However, Wang Wenjuan performed meticulously, and the audience frequently erupted in enthusiastic applause. The audience cheered not only for her superb acting skills but also for her noble artistic integrity.

I have received several dozen theater troupes, but actors like Wang Wenjuan are rare. Based on what I have seen and heard, I feel compelled to share my thoughts.

　　技艺精湛　品德高尚        
    王文娟是演员的好榜样
    我镇在扬子江中的一个小岛上。今年春节前夕，镇影剧院领导人怀着试试看的心情，邀请著名越剧演员王文娟等人来镇上演出。王文娟欣然答应了。
    我们原打算雇几辆高级轿车到上海接演员。可是，王文娟认为，这样开支太大，婉言谢绝了。正月初一，她和其他演员坐上一辆大客车来了。中午，在车上她啃了一个面包充饥。一下车，王文娟对我镇接待的同志说，她是来演出的，不需要什么照顾，吃饭，住宿一切从简。我们安排她住３人一间的普通客房，她说蛮好。由于条件太简陋，我们感到难为情，准备让她搬到一家大饭店去，但怎么说，她也不同意。
    正月初二，演出正式开始。由于天不作美，雨下个不停，影响了上座率。但是王文娟演出一丝不苟，台下不时爆发出一阵阵热烈的掌声。观众既为她精湛的表演艺术喝彩，同时也为她高尚的戏德叫好。
    我曾接待过几十个剧团，像王文娟这样的演员实在少见。所见所闻，有感可发，不吐不快。
