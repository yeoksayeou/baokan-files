The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the "Draft Law on Reciprocal Relations with Taiwan" currently under discussion in the Philippine legislature violates the principles established in the Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between China and the Philippines, as well as the 313rd Administrative Order issued by President Corazon Aquino.

At a press conference this afternoon, the spokesperson said, "We have noted that the Philippine government has repeatedly reaffirmed its adherence to the 'One China' policy. The Philippine Foreign Minister, Manglapus, has also made a clear statement on the issue of the 'Draft Law on Reciprocal Relations with Taiwan.' We appreciate this." He pointed out that China opposes any country that has established diplomatic relations with China from engaging in official exchanges with Taiwan. China generally does not object to some countries engaging in civilian trade with Taiwan.

Li Zhaoxing hopes that the few legislators who proposed this draft will consider the broader interests of Sino-Philippine friendship, withdraw the "Draft Law on Reciprocal Relations with Taiwan," and refrain from doing anything that harms the feelings of the Chinese people and impedes the fundamental interests of the Philippine people.

### 外交部发言人说  菲律宾对台关系法草案有违中菲建交公报原则

　　外交部发言人说
    菲律宾对台关系法草案有违中菲建交公报原则
    据新华社北京３月１６日电  外交部发言人李肇星今天在这里说，菲律宾议会正在讨论的“对台互惠关系法”草案违背了中菲建交联合公报所确定的原则，也违反了科·阿基诺总统颁布的３１３号行政命令。
    在今天下午的新闻发布会上回答记者提问时，这位发言人说：“我们注意到菲律宾政府一再重申奉行‘一个中国’的政策，菲外长曼格拉普斯也已对‘对台互惠关系法’问题作了明确表态，我们对此表示赞赏。”他指出，中国反对任何同我国建立外交关系的国家同台湾发生官方往来。对一些国家同台湾发生民间的贸易往来，中国一般不持异议。
    李肇星希望提出这个草案的少数议员以中菲友谊大局为重，撤回“对台互惠关系法”草案，不要做伤害中国人民感情和妨碍菲律宾人民基本利益的事。
