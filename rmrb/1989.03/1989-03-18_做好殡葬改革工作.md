One of my aunts passed away, and according to the funeral reform requirements, she was cremated. However, her relatives reburied her ashes in a coffin and set up a funeral pavilion, with music and rituals, holding a traditional burial ceremony. This "double burial" not only negates the purpose of funeral reform but also wastes more manpower and resources.

Strangely, in some places where funeral reform has been implemented and cremation is promoted, as long as cremation is done first, relatives can proceed with a traditional burial without interference. It is no wonder that funeral reform, which has been carried out for many years, has had little effect. On the contrary, some places have adopted countermeasures to resist cremation. For example, there is "secret burial," where after someone dies, their relatives secretly prepare a coffin, bury the body, and build a tomb, all in secret. There is also "guest burial," where people, before or after death, are quickly sent back to their rural hometowns, pretending to "die loving their homeland" so they can be buried there. Additionally, there are "stealth burials" and "rush burials," where relatives steal the body from a hospital morgue or other places where the deceased is kept, quickly move it, and bury it elsewhere, creating a fait accompli.

It is worth noting that the above behaviors often appear in the guise of "filial piety," using this to gain sympathy from the surrounding community. On the other hand, those who insist on funeral reform and promote cremation often find themselves "unpopular."

Funeral reform is a major task of changing customs and transforming ideas. The key is for cadres at all levels to take the lead and do in-depth and detailed ideological work among the people, explaining the reasons, persuading and mobilizing them, and guiding them appropriately. It would be best to supplement this with transitional measures such as "deep burial" and collecting land occupation fees, gradually turning policies into the people's voluntary actions. It is also important to note that during the funeral reform process, we should not act simply or hastily. Some places forcibly exhume already buried bodies for cremation, which hurts the feelings of the people. I think this is not advisable. Relying solely on administrative orders is not effective, and punishing without educating is even worse. Ignoring the "double burial" practice, which only goes through the formality of cremation, is also not appropriate. Funerals are a major event in life, affecting thousands of households, and the people take them very seriously. How to do this work well deserves our careful consideration.

### 做好殡葬改革工作

　　做好殡葬改革工作
    河南新乡市  钟玉竹
    我的一位堂婶去世后，按照殡葬改革的要求火化了。但是，亲属又将她的骨灰重殓入棺，并搭起灵棚，吹吹打打做道场，举行了土葬仪式。这种“双葬”，不但失去殡葬改革的意义，而且耗费更多的人力物力。
    令人奇怪的是，在一些已经实行殡葬改革，推行火葬制度的地方，只要火化在先，死者的亲属再搞土葬便无人过问了。难怪殡葬改革工作推行多年，收效甚微。相反，一些地方出现了抵制火葬的对策。比如“偷葬”，即人死后，秘而不宣，由其亲属连夜制棺、入殓、挖穴、造墓，一切暗中进行，行若无事。还有所谓“客葬”，即有的人临终前或逝世后，被家属赶紧送回农村原籍，佯作“死恋故土”以便就地土葬。此外，还有“盗葬”、“抢葬”等，即从医院太平间或其它安放死者处所，抢走死者遗体，迅速转移，易地土葬，造成既成事实。
    值得注意的是，以上种种行为，常常是以行“孝道”的姿态出现的，借此赢得周围群众的同情。而坚持殡葬改革，推行火葬的做法，倒常常“不得人心”。
    殡葬改革是一项移风易俗、转变观念的艰巨工作，重要的问题在于各级干部要带头，同时应当给群众做深入细致的思想工作，晓之以理，说服动员，因势利导。最好再辅之以实行“深葬”和征收占地费等过渡办法，逐步把政策变成群众的自觉行动。还应当注意的是，在殡葬改革过程中，不能简单行事或操之过急。有些地方强行把已经土葬的死者挖出，再去火葬，很伤群众感情。我认为这是不可取的。单靠行政命令是不行的，以罚代教或罚而不教更是不对的，而对徒有火化形式的“双葬”法撒手不管也不足取。丧葬是人生的一件大事，事关千家万户，群众极为重视，如何做好此项工作，值得我们好好动动脑筋。
