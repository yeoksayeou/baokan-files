Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 9th.

In Shanghai, some individuals caught up in the "fever" to leave the country have resorted to illegal means to raise the large sums of money needed for emigration, resulting in cases of embezzlement and bribery, and ultimately landing themselves in jail before they even leave the country.

In recent years, the number of people leaving Shanghai privately has surged. Some individuals, in order to raise the enormous funds required for emigration, have engaged in large-scale embezzlement and bribery, embezzling state property. According to the Shanghai Municipal People's Procuratorate and the procuratorates of districts such as Nan Shi and Huang Pu, since the second half of last year, 23 such cases have been uncovered, and 23 criminals have been apprehended.
