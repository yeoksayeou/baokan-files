Today, the Shanghai Liberation Daily published a letter from the public in a prominent position on its first page, as required by the municipal disciplinary commission. The letter exposes that some cadres still use sedans to pick up and drop off their children at school. The letter lists the license plate numbers of some cars parked in front of Shanghai Middle School, totaling 17 vehicles.

The Shanghai Liberation Daily also published an article stating: “Publishing the license plate numbers of public cars used for private matters in the newspaper is a powerful form of public opinion supervision. Every citizen has the right to record the license plate numbers of such cars they personally witness, write to the newspaper, and the newspaper can publish them periodically. If necessary, the names of the units and even the individuals using the cars can be exposed together.”

　　儿孙上学用公车——气派
    车号抄下登报纸——难堪     
    上海市纪委公布群众来信
    本报上海３月６日电  记者章世鸿报道：今天上海解放日报一版以显著地位发表市纪委要求公布的一封群众来信。来信揭露某些干部至今仍用轿车接送自己的孩子上学。此信抄录上海中学门前部分汽车号码，共１７辆之多。
    解放日报同时发表署名文章指出：“把那些用来办私事的公车号码，公之于报端，是一种有力的舆论监督。每个公民，都有权将自己亲眼目睹的这类公车号码，抄录下来，写给报纸，报纸可以定期公布，必要时，还可以连同单位以至用车人的大名一起曝光。”
