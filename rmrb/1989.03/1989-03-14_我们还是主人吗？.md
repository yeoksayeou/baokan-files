The phrase "If you don't mention the master, no one gets excited; if you do mention the master, everyone gets upset" reflects the sentiments of many workers in enterprises. There is a contradiction here: on one hand, workers are dissatisfied with the decline of their master status; on the other hand, when they are reminded that they are the masters of the enterprise, they become unhappy. Where is this "knot" tied? Read on—

Are We Still the Masters?
By People's Daily reporter Pí Shùyì

Workers are the masters of the enterprise. For many years, this concise and powerful slogan has greatly inspired workers' enthusiasm for labor. However, in recent years, it has become somewhat ineffective. You tell them they are the masters, and instead of being happy, they get angry: the more reforms there are, the less I feel like a master! Some workers even say: If you don't mention the master, no one gets excited; if you do mention the master, everyone gets upset.

In 1986, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions conducted a survey of over a million workers, and 56% of them felt that workers' status had not improved but had instead declined after the reforms. Recently, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions surveyed 210,000 workers in 17 cities and found that one factor affecting workers' enthusiasm for labor was their perception of a decline in their status.

On the surface, there seems to be an inexplicable contradiction: on one hand, workers are dissatisfied with the decline of their master status; on the other hand, when they are reminded that they are the "masters of the enterprise," they become unhappy. Where exactly is this "knot" tied?

At a debate in the Dalian Shipyard, a young worker spoke passionately: At home, I am the master, and I have the final say. If you ask me what a master is, it is someone who has the final say.

People often understand the master status of workers as having the final say. Being in charge of the enterprise means having the power to manage the enterprise. In reality, at this stage, workers can only participate in the management of the enterprise or indirectly manage it through their representatives; they cannot completely have the final say, and certainly not every worker can have the final say.

Workers are laborers in a socialized production enterprise, not small-scale producers. Socialized large-scale production is highly specialized and technologically complex, and it cannot do without managers with specialized knowledge. Workers cannot avoid being subject to such management authority. If everyone has the final say, production cannot continue for a single day. As Engels said: "The automatic machinery in large factories is much more despotic than any small capitalist who employs workers, at least in terms of labor time, and one could write on the gates of these factories: 'Those who enter must give up all self-government.'"

People also often use the idea that the people are the masters of the means of production to infer that workers are the masters of the enterprise. In fact, the means of production in state-owned enterprises belong to all the people, and the workers of a particular enterprise do not own the specific ownership rights to that enterprise. The operation and management of the enterprise are entrusted by the state to the factory director or manager. Some reform pilot enterprises can, through the form of workers' shares, enable workers to have a certain degree of specific ownership rights. The trend of "separation of ownership and management" shows: those who have the final say are not necessarily the owners, and the owners do not necessarily have the final say. Management has become a profession for the managerial class, and the many scattered shareholders find it increasingly difficult to directly intervene in the enterprise. They generally no longer use their hands to vote (in shareholders' meetings) but use their feet to vote (by buying and selling shares) to influence the enterprise.

The manager of one factory distributed his earned contract bonus of 2,800 yuan equally among the workers, each receiving 2.6 jiao. The workers were very moved: although the amount was small, it showed that the "servant" was thinking of the "master." In another factory, the manager received a contract bonus of 1,000 yuan, and the workers complained: The "master" works, and the "servant" gets rich. They secretly started to "loaf on the job."

The manager is the "servant," and the workers are the "masters." This is another common saying about the master status of workers.

In fact, in a socialist enterprise, the manager is also part of the working class, equal in status to the workers, and both are masters of the enterprise; but their roles are different. Workers are laborers, and managers are administrators. The relationship between them is that of administrators and the administered, not that of "servants" and "masters." It is precisely that workers should be subject to the manager's management authority, not that the manager should simply obey the workers' orders.

Entrepreneurs are the "driving force" of the commodity economy. China urgently needs to cultivate a large number of socialist entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs bear the risks for the development of the enterprise, invest their energy, and should rightly receive higher remuneration; to efficiently direct production, they must have strict management authority. If they are seen as "servants" hired by the workers, it is natural to ask: How can the "servant" earn more than the "master"? How can the "master" be managed by the "servant"? Now, some managers are precisely troubled by this.

The saying that the manager is a "servant" may come from the term "public servant." The Paris Commune revolutionary government proposed the slogan that the leaders of the commune are "public servants" of society, which indicated the purpose of the commune leaders to serve the people. Today, all our cadres should serve the people, and managers are no exception. However, as entrepreneurs, their identity as "public servants" should not be understood as "servants" who are subject to the orders of the workers of their enterprise. They serve the people not simply by serving the workers of their enterprise. They face the market and are responsible to the owners. Managing the enterprise well is the best way to serve the workers. Of course, the manager's power needs to be constrained, and the manager needs to be supervised by the workers, but this does not mean a "master-servant" relationship. The division of labor between administrators and the administered should not be blurred.

A 22-year-old, gentle and quiet female worker, upon learning that she had been listed as an outsider, went to the burly foreman and slapped him in the face... In the Harbin Carbon Factory, 34 workers who were laid off due to optimization were in pain and resentment. People commented: If this is how it is, what advantage does socialism have!

People have formed the idea that "iron rice bowl" and "big pot of rice" are the advantages of socialism and are the treatment that masters should receive.

Labor is still a means of livelihood. If labor does not receive corresponding remuneration, if it is the same whether one works hard or not, who would want to work hard! Without pressure, without crisis, with the state taking care of everything from birth to death, who would be diligent! The "big pot of rice" and "iron rice bowl" bring about economic inefficiency, low income, and low welfare for workers.

Eating from the "big pot of rice" makes one lazy, and the "iron rice bowl" keeps one from growing. The "iron rice bowl" system has fostered a dependent "infantile" mentality, lacking the spirit of independence and the ability to bear risks. When the tide of the commodity economy comes, one naturally becomes helpless. The "big pot of rice" and "iron rice bowl" treatment has not brought real benefits to workers.

A contractor in Guangxi gave a speech to the workers: Marry a chicken, follow the chicken; marry a dog, follow the dog; follow a monk, carry the bowl and go.

Some enterprise leaders often emphasize the workers' master duties: work hard during normal times, share the burden during difficulties, and do not respect the workers, do not value democratic management. Some even arbitrarily infringe on the workers' legal rights. According to statistics from the trade unions of some industries, districts, counties, and bureaus in Shenyang, in the first three quarters of last year, 79 out of 79 strikes, work stoppages, and collective petitions were mainly caused by cadres infringing on workers' interests.

Whether it is the workers or the leaders, they should have a realistic understanding of what it means for workers to be masters. It is unrealistic to elevate workers to "heaven" and pursue an overly high master status; it is also unacceptable to completely deny the workers' master status and throw them into "hell."

In a socialist state-owned enterprise, workers, as laborers, combine with the means of production owned by all the people to become the main body of production, changing their previous status of being subordinate to capital and being exploited and oppressed. It is in this sense that workers become the masters of the enterprise.

The master status of workers is first reflected in the fact that workers should enjoy rights related to labor, such as the right to choose employment, labor protection, labor remuneration, and labor rest.

The master status of workers is also reflected in the democratic management of the enterprise. Workers, as the main body of production, should enjoy the right to know about the enterprise's affairs, the right to participate in the enterprise's decision-making, and the right to supervise the enterprise's cadres. The system of workers' congresses is the basic form of democratic management. Of course, democratic management is still an indirect and limited form of management.

Some workers evaluate the change in workers' status like this: In the 1950s, they stood up and liberated themselves, feeling proud; in the 1960s, they overcame difficulties together; in the 1970s, they led everything, standing tall; in the 1980s, they implemented reforms, feeling inferior. Is this correct? Is this comprehensive?

From "masters of the enterprise" to "leading everything," the old system elevated workers' status very high, but how much real content was there?

At that time, the enterprise was an appendage of the administrative organs, with the power belonging to the higher authorities. Inside the factory, it was the Party Committee that had unified leadership, and in reality, it was the Party Committee secretary who had the final say. The factory director had little power, let alone the workers having a say. For example, in terms of choosing employment, it was completely up to the state to allocate, and workers were transferred like steel and cement. In terms of labor remuneration, more labor did not mean more pay. If a person cannot become the master of their own fate, how can they become the master of the enterprise or the state!

During the "Cultural Revolution," the idea of workers being masters was pushed to the extreme: the working class leads everything. Workers rushed into society, occupied the superstructure, and transformed intellectuals, resulting in chaos in production and society.

The old system gave workers a false sense of being masters, but workers were so intoxicated by this falsehood that they did not realize the emptiness of their master status. When the reforms shattered this falsehood, it was inevitable that they would experience psychological imbalance. The implementation of leasing and contracting systems, the promotion of the factory director responsibility system, and the strengthening of labor discipline all highlighted the status of the factory director, widening the gap with the workers, making the workers feel that their status had declined. A series of measures to impact the "iron rice bowl" and "big pot of rice," such as optimization of the workforce, internal unemployment, and enterprise bankruptcy, made the workers feel that they had lost the security of being masters.

Throwing away the vague understanding of the master issue and realistically looking at the reforms, one can see that the reforms bring risks to the workers and also bring real benefits. The master status of workers is moving from falsehood to reality. "Two-way selection" makes workers' employment begin to have choices and mobility; contracting, piecework, and other distribution reforms make workers receive more for more work, increasing their income; the expansion of enterprise autonomy increases the opportunities for workers to participate in enterprise management. The reforms make workers and enterprises a community of shared destiny, with workers' interests closely linked to the enterprise's interests. If one suffers, both suffer; if one prospers, both prosper. Workers genuinely care about the enterprise, and the master status of workers tends towards the unity of responsibilities, rights, and interests.

At this point, perhaps we can summarize a few words:

Regarding the saying "workers' master status," it is necessary to clarify those vague and general understandings and not to simply introduce this political concept into economic management. It must be scientifically, concretely, and correctly explained and understood.

Emphasizing "master status" should prevent utilitarianism and using it for one's own purposes. Some workers emphasize being masters, only wanting to enjoy the rights of being a master; some managers loudly proclaim that workers are masters, only wanting to use it to mobilize enthusiasm and fulfill the duties of being a master. The effects will not be good. Only by insisting on reforms can the master status be realized. This requires not only reforming the old system and formulating new measures but also breaking away from old ideas and establishing new viewpoints.

### 我们还是主人吗？

专栏：改革话题

    “不提主人不来气，一提主人一肚子气。”企业中不少职工有这种思想情绪。这里有个矛盾：一方面职工为自己主人翁地位下降而不满，一方面向他强调是企业的主人又不高兴。这个“扣儿”结在哪里？请读——
    我们还是主人吗？
    本报记者　皮树义
    职工是企业的主人。多年来，这一简洁有力的口号曾大大激发了职工的劳动热情，然而，近年来却有些失灵了。你说他是主人，他不但不高兴，反而来了气：越改革我越不像主人了！有的职工甚至说：不提主人不来气，一提主人一肚子气。
    １９８６年，全国总工会在上百万职工中调查，５６％的职工认为，改革后工人的地位没有提高反而下降。不久前，全国总工会对１７个城市２１万职工的调查表明，影响劳动热情的一个因素就是职工认为地位降低。
    表面看来，这里存在着一个难以解释的矛盾：一方面，职工为自己主人翁地位降低而不满；一方面向他强调是“企业的主人”又不高兴。这个“扣儿”究竟结在什么地方了呢？
    在大连船厂的一次辩论会上，一位青年工人侃侃而谈：在家里我是主人，说了算。要我说什么是主人，说了算的就是主人。
    人们常把职工的主人地位理解为自己“说了算”。在企业当家作主就是拥有企业的管理权，而实际上，现阶段职工只能参与企业管理或通过自己的代表来间接管理，不可能完全由职工说了算，更不可每个职工都说了算。
    职工是社会化生产企业中的劳动者，不是一家一户的小生产者。社会化大生产分工细密、技术复杂，不能没有具有专门知识的企业管理者，职工不能不服从这种管理权威，如果人人说了算，生产一天也进行不下去。正如恩格斯所说：“大工厂里的自动机器，比任何雇用工人的小资本家要专制得多，至少就劳动时间而言，可以在这些工厂的大门上写上这样一句话：进门者请放弃一切自治。”
    人们也常用人民是生产资料的主人，来推论职工当家作主的主人地位。其实，全民所有制企业的生产资料是全体人民的财产，本企业职工并不拥有对本企业的具体所有权，企业的经营管理是由国家委托给厂长、经理来进行的。一些改革试点企业可以通过职工入股形式，使职工拥有一定的、具体的所有权，“两权分离”的趋势表明：说了算的不一定是所有者，所有者不一定说了算。管理已成了经理阶层的职业，众多的分散的股东对企业直接干预越来越困难。他们一般不再是用手投票（在股东大会上表决），而是用脚投票（买卖股票）来影响企业。
    一家工厂的厂长，把自己应得的２８００元承包奖平均分给了职工，每人得了２角６分。职工很受感动：钱虽少，却说明“仆人”想着“主人”。另一家工厂的厂长拿了１０００元应得的承包奖，职工抱怨：“主人”干活，“仆人”发家，悄悄“磨”起了“洋工”。
    厂长是“仆人”，职工是“主人”。这是关于职工主人地位的又一个常用说法。
    其实在社会主义企业里，厂长也是工人阶级的一部分，与职工地位平等，同是企业的主人；但分工不同，职工是劳动者，厂长是管理者。二者是管理者与被管理者的关系，而不是“仆人”与“主人”的关系。恰恰是职工要服从厂长的管理权威，而不是要厂长简单地听从职工的支配。
    企业家是商品经济发展的“动力机”。中国急需造就一大批社会主义企业家。企业家为企业的发展承担风险，付出心血，理应得到较高的报酬；为了高效率地指挥生产，他们必须有严格管理的权威。如果把他们看作是工人“雇”的“仆人”，自然就会提出：“仆人”怎么能比“主人”收入高？“主人”怎么能受“仆人”管？现在，一些经营者正是受着这样的困扰。
    说厂长是“仆人”，可能来源于“公仆”这一说法。巴黎公社革命政权提出了公社领导是“社会公仆”的口号，表明了公社领导为人民服务的宗旨。今天，我们的一切干部都应为人民服务，厂长、经理也不例外，但是作为企业家，他们的“社会公仆”身份不能理解成是听从本企业职工支配的“仆人”，他们为人民服务也不是简单地等于为本企业职工服务，他们面向市场，对所有者负责，经营管理好企业就是最好地为职工服务。当然，厂长的权力需要制约，厂长也需要职工监督，但这不等于“主仆”关系。管理者与被管理者的分工不能模糊。
    一位２２岁、文文静静的女工，当听到自己被列入编外后，找到膀大腰圆的组长，挥手就是一记耳光……哈尔滨电碳厂３４位被优化组合下来的职工痛苦、愤懑。人们议论：这么搞，社会主义还有啥优越性！
    人们形成了这样的观念：“大锅饭”、“铁饭碗”等于社会主义的优越性，也是主人应有的待遇。
    劳动现在还是谋生的手段。劳动不能获得相应的报酬，干多干少一个样，谁还愿意多干！没有压力，没有危机，生老病死国家包下来，谁又能勤快得起来！“大锅饭”、“铁饭碗”带来的是经济的低效率，职工的低收入、低福利。
    吃“大锅饭”身子懒，端“铁饭碗”长不大。“铁饭碗”体制养成了依赖国家的“婴儿心理”，缺乏独立自主的意识和承担风险的能力。当商品经济的大潮涌来时，自然是手足无措。“大锅饭、铁饭碗”这种“主人待遇”并没有给职工带来实惠。
    广西一位承包者对职工发表演说：嫁鸡随鸡，嫁狗随狗，跟了和尚，端着瓢走。
    一些企业的领导者往往强调的是职工的主人义务：平时好好干活，困难时为厂分忧，不尊重职工，不重视民主管理，有的甚至任意侵犯职工的合法权益。据沈阳市部分产业、县、区、局工会统计，去年前３个季度发生的７９起罢工、怠工、集体上访事件，大多是因为干部侵犯职工利益引起的。
    无论是职工，还是领导者，对职工究竟是什么意义上的主人都应有实事求是的认识。把工人捧上“天堂”，追求过高的主人地位，是不现实的；把工人打入“地狱”，完全否定职工的主人地位，也是不能允许的。
    在社会主义全民企业里，职工作为劳动者，同全民的生产资料结合在一起，成为生产的主体，改变了过去隶属于资本而受剥削、压迫的地位，在为自己、为社会劳动。正是从这个意义上说，职工成为企业的主人。
    职工的主人地位首先表现在职工应当享有就业选择、劳动保护、劳动报酬、劳动休息等有关劳动方面的权利。
    职工的主人地位也体现在对企业的民主管理上。职工作为生产的主体应当享有对企业事务的知情权、对企业决策的参与权、对企业干部的监督权。职工代表大会制是民主管理的基本形式。当然，民主管理还是一种间接的、有限的管理。
    有的职工这样评价职工地位的变化：５０年代翻身解放，扬眉吐气；６０年代克服困难，齐心协力；７０年代领导一切，顶天立地；８０年代实行改革，低三下四。——对吗？全面吗？
    从“企业主人”到“领导一切”，旧体制下职工地位捧得很高，可是，究竟有多少实际内容呢？
    那时，企业是行政机构的附属物，大权归于上级，厂内是党委一元化领导，实际是党委书记说了算，连厂长都没有多少权力，更何谈职工当家作主，职工甚至做不了自己的主。比如，在就业选择上，完全靠国家分配，职工像钢材、水泥一样被调拨；在劳动报酬上，多劳不能多得。一个人如果不能成为自己命运的主人，又怎么能成为企业的主人、国家的主人！
    到了“文化大革命”，职工当家作主被推到了极端：工人阶级领导一切。职工冲向社会，占领上层建筑，改造知识分子，结果是乱了生产，也乱了社会。
    旧体制带给职工的是虚幻的主人感，然而，职工在这种虚幻中沉醉得太久，并不觉得自己主人地位的空洞，当改革打碎了这种虚幻时，难免心理失衡。租赁、承包制的实行，厂长负责制的推广，劳动纪律的加强，都突出了厂长的地位，拉开了与职工的差距，职工感到地位降低；优化组合、厂内待业、企业破产……一系列冲击“铁饭碗”、“大锅饭”的措施，则使职工感到失掉了主人的安全感。
    抛掉主人问题的模糊认识，实事求是看改革，就会看到改革给职工带来风险，也带来实惠，职工的主人地位正在从虚幻走向现实。“双向选择”使职工就业开始有了选择性、流动性；承包、计件等项分配改革，使职工多劳多得，收入增加；企业自主权的扩大，增加了职工参与企业管理的机会。改革使职工与企业结成命运共同体，职工利益与企业利益紧密相连，一损俱损，一荣俱荣，职工实实在在地关心企业，职工的主人地位趋向责权利统一。
    说到这里，也许我们可以总括地说上几句：
    对于“工人的主人翁地位”这一说法，需要澄清那些模糊的、笼统的认识，也不应把这一政治概念简单地引入经济管理之中。对它必须作科学的、具体的、正确的解释和理解。
    强调“主人翁地位”，要防止实用主义，为我所用。有的职工强调当主人，只愿享受主人的权利；有的管理者大声称职工为主人，只想用它调动积极性，尽主人的义务。其效果都不会好。只有坚持改革，才能使主人翁地位落到实处。这既要改革旧体制，制订新措施，又要破除旧观念，树立新观点。
