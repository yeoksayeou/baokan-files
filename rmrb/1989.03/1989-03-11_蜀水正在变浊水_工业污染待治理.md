	Sichuan's waters are turning murky: industrial pollution awaits remediation
	People's Daily reports: Correspondent Xie Lianhui reports: Recently, a Sichuan provincial government official revealed during a meeting with the State Council's Environmental Protection Committee's inspection team that Sichuan's industrial pollution is severe. In the basin, which accounts for one-third of the province's area, the average pollution load per unit area is more than three times the national average and seven times the global average.

	With a population of over 100 million, 80% of Sichuan's industry and population are concentrated in the basin. Due to the large amount of sulfur dioxide and soot discharged into the atmosphere, since 1981, the concentration of total suspended particulates in the air of the province's cities has shown an increasing trend, and 16 cities have experienced acid rain. Water pollution within the province is prominent, with an annual discharge of 3.3 billion tons of industrial and domestic wastewater containing various harmful substances. More than 90% of this wastewater is discharged directly into rivers without treatment, resulting in 80% of the water bodies being polluted to varying degrees. The province has accumulated over 300 million tons of industrial waste and domestic garbage over the years, occupying more than 2,000 hectares of land. It is understood that this province, which accounts for 1/10 of the national population and 5.3% of the national industrial output value, has a total sulfur dioxide and wastewater discharge that also accounts for 1/10 of the national total. However, the funds allocated for pollution control only account for 0.3% of the national income, which is less than 1/3 of the required amount and 50% lower than the national average.

	This inspection activity was organized by the Environmental Protection Committee after Chen Yun and other central leaders made instructions on the environmental issues in Sichuan and Benxi. The inspection team affirmed Chengdu's experience in reducing paper mill wastewater pollution through concentrated pulp production and Ziyang Sugar Factory's anaerobic fermentation of wastewater. They also learned about the situation of treating the Beixi River in Zigong City and the pollution around the Lingyun Scenic Area in Leshan City. Deputy Governor of Sichuan Province, Ma Lin, stated that awareness needs to be raised and pollution control should be placed on the important agenda.

　　蜀水正在变浊水
    工业污染待治理
    本报讯  记者谢联辉报道：日前，四川省政府负责人在与国务院环境保护委员会赴川考察小组座谈时透露，四川工业污染严重，占全省面积的１／３的盆地内，单位面积平均承受的污染负荷高于全国平均水平的３倍以上，高于全球平均水平的７倍。
    人口逾亿的四川，８０％的工业和人口集中在盆地。由于大量二氧化硫和烟尘排入大气，从１９８１年起，全省城市大气中总悬浮微粒浓度呈增加趋势，１６个城市已经出现酸雨。省内水质污染突出，年排含有各种有害物质的工业废水、生活废水达３３亿吨，其中９０％以上未进行处理直接排入江河，致使８０％的水域受到不同程度的污染。全省历年堆积的工业废渣、生活垃圾已有３亿多吨，占地２０００多公顷。据了解，这个人口占全国１／１０、工业产值占全国５．３％，而二氧化硫与污水排放总量均占全国１／１０的大省，用于污染治理的资金仅占国民收入的０．３％，不足需要数的１／３，比全国平均水平低５０％。
    这一次考察活动，是环委会在陈云和中央其他领导同志就四川和本溪环境问题作了批示后组织的。考察组肯定了成都市为减少造纸废液污染集中制浆、资阳糖厂废液厌氧发酵等经验，了解了自贡市治理釜溪河情况和乐山市凌云风景区周围的污染状况。四川省副省长马麟表示，要提高认识，把治理污染放到重要日程上来。
