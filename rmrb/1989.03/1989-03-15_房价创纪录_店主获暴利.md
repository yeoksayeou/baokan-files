A luxurious hotel with 92 rooms in the United States is up for sale, reportedly for $100 million, with an average price of $1 million per room, setting a world record for hotel room prices.

The hotel, named Bel-Air, is located on Beverly Hills in California, not far from the private residence of former President Reagan. The owner, Ms. Hunt, is the daughter of a Texas oil tycoon. She purchased the hotel in 1982 for $22.1 million and, due to her astute management, the occupancy rate has consistently remained around 95%. It features 33 luxury suites, each with a nightly rental rate of $1,300.

Now, Ms. Hunt has decided to stop managing the hotel and is putting it up for international bidding. News of the sale has already attracted over 100 companies and individuals interested in bidding, with at least two expressing a willingness to offer more than $100 million. The bidding date is set for April 17, and there may be more surprises in store. Thus, Ms. Hunt's investment, made less than seven years ago, could yield a profit of at least $80 million.

Nearby, another large hotel with 260 rooms was acquired two years ago by the world's richest man, the Sultan of Brunei, for $185 million. He bought it from American tycoon Mr. Davis, who had owned the hotel for only nine months and made a profit of $50 million from the sale.

These two examples not only indicate a bright future for the international tourism industry but also show that highly profitable real estate transactions in the United States are increasingly focused on large hotels or large shopping centers.

　　房价创纪录  店主获暴利
    美国一座拥有９２个居室的豪华旅馆正在待价而沽，据说可售１亿美元，平均每个房间售价将高达１００万美元，创下了旅馆房间售价的世界纪录。
    这座名为贝尔埃尔的旅馆位于加利福尼亚州的比弗利山上，距前总统里根的私邸不远。业主亨特女士是得克萨斯州一位石油富商的女儿。她在１９８２年以２２１０万美元买下这座旅馆，因经营有方，住房率经常保持在９５％左右。它有３３个豪华套房，每套一晚租金达１３００美元。
    现在亨特女士无意继续经营，决定在国际上招标出售。消息传出后，立即有１００多家公司和个人准备投标，其中至少有两家表示愿出价１亿美元以上。开标日期已定在４月１７日，届时可能还会爆出高价冷门。这样，亨特女士的一笔投资，仅经过不足７年便至少可获利８０００万美元。
    在贝尔埃尔旅馆附近另有一座拥有２６０个房间的大旅馆，两年前被世界第一号富翁文莱国苏丹以１．８５亿美元收购了。他是从美国富翁戴维斯先生手中盘入的，戴维斯买下那座旅馆不过９个月，一转手便赚了５０００万美元。
    这两个例子一方面说明国际旅游业前景看好，另一方面显示利润丰厚的房地产交易在美国已趋向大旅馆或大商店。
