In the days leading up to the 40th World Table Tennis Championships, the Westfalenhalle in Dortmund, where the event is being held, is bustling with activity. Committee members, who have forfeited their Easter holiday, are busy with final preparations. They are rehearsing the opening ceremony, printing schedules and various forms, setting up the press center, and arranging the table tennis equipment exhibition.

The South Korean team arrived in Dortmund on the 25th. After unloading their luggage, they headed straight to the competition hall. The appearance of Olympic men's singles champion Ryu Seung-min drew a lot of attention. Some reporters approached him with questions, but Ryu shook his head, indicating he couldn't understand. He probably doesn't speak much English. The South Korean team's leader and coach watched the Chinese athletes practicing while exchanging greetings with the Chinese team's coach. When discussing Liang Yuzhi, they mentioned that she wouldn't be participating this time due to health issues and had retired. Additionally, veteran player Kim Wan would not be competing, as he had gone to a club in Sweden to play and coach.

Other national teams have not yet arrived in Dortmund. Some teams are training in nearby cities, while others are participating in smaller international competitions in other European countries to warm up. A large number of participants will start arriving from Monday (27th).

Mr. Geip, who participated in the 25th World Table Tennis Championships here with Chuang Tzu-tung, is now the chairman of the West German Table Tennis Association. He has a deep impression of Chuang and described the scene of the slim Chuang, wearing long sports pants, competing with the stout Hungarian veteran Sidó for the championship. He also expressed regret over Chuang's early passing.

Chinese team coaches Xu Shaofa and Zhang Xiaoqin told reporters in the practice hall that the athletes' condition is good these days. They haven't arranged a large training load to avoid the athletes becoming too excited or fatigued too early. Many West German friends came to watch the Chinese team practice and inquired about which players would participate in the team event. A local fan told the Chinese reporter, "You can win the championship no matter who you put on the field. You don't need to come so early to train." The Chinese team coaches, however, disagreed, saying, "The opponents are getting stronger. If we don't come early to familiarize ourselves with the venue and adapt to the time difference, we may not be able to perform at our best during the competition."

### 多特蒙德世乒赛前夕

　　多特蒙德世乒赛前夕
    这几天，第４０届世乒赛赛场——多特蒙德威斯法伦比赛大厅里，放弃了复活节假期的组委会工作人员正忙着最后的筹备工作；彩排开幕式、印制赛程和各种表格、装备新闻中心和布置乒乓球器材展览台等等。
    南朝鲜队２５日抵达多特蒙德后，卸下行装即来到比赛大厅。奥运会男子单打冠军刘南奎的出现引起不少人的注意。有的记者上去想问几个问题，刘摇摇头表示听不懂，他可能英语不太好。南朝鲜队的领队和教练一边观看着正在练球的中国运动员，一边同中国队教练打招呼。谈到梁英子时，他们说，梁这次不来了，她由于身体不好退役。另外男队老将金浣也不参加比赛，他到瑞典的一个俱乐部打球和当教练去了。
    其它国家的选手目前尚未抵达多特蒙德。有的队在附近城市训练，有的队正在欧洲其它国家参加小型国际比赛热身。大批人马将从星期一（２７日）起陆续到来。
    当年和容国团一起在这里参加过第２５届世乒赛的盖普先生，如今担任着联邦德国乒协主席。他对容国团留有很深的印象，他描述了当年身材瘦瘦的容国团穿着长运动裤与胖胖的匈牙利老将西多争冠的情景，并对容国团的早逝表示惋惜。
    中国队教练许绍发、张燮林在练习厅对记者说，这两天队员们状态不错，训练运动量没有安排很大，怕引起队员们过早兴奋和疲劳。不少联邦德国朋友闻讯赶来看中国队训练，并纷纷打听参加团体赛的是哪几个人。一位当地球迷对中国记者说，你们不管上谁都能拿冠军，你们也用不着这么早来训练。中国队教练则不以为然，他们说，对手越来越强劲，不早些来熟悉场地环境和适应一下时差，比赛时就可能发挥不出应有水平。
