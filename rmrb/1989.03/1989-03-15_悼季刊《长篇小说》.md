Title: In Memoriam: The Quarterly Journal "Long Novels"
Author: Mǔguó Zhèng

Edition: 8

The quarterly journal "Long Novels," published by the Beijing October Literature Press, has finally come to an end.

This outcome was not unexpected. Over the past two years, the market for literary books has rapidly shrunk. The print run of our journal has also been declining. By the time we had to ask authors for help in distributing the last issue, the end was already in sight.

The journal was born in the vibrant literary era of 1983.

In the winter of 1982, while most Chinese writers were focused on short and medium-length novels, the Beijing Publishing House (a branch of the Beijing October Literature Press) convened a symposium on long novels in Beijing to promote the creation of long novels. Many literary luminaries in Beijing attended, and Comrade Zhou Yang also showed his support. The direct result of that meeting was the launch of the "Long Novels" journal the following year. As a regularly published journal dedicated to long novels, it was the first of its kind in the country.

It survived for five years. During these five years, the ups and downs of the literary world naturally affected our editorial department, and various trivial troubles also plagued us during the publishing process.

But despite the frustrations, there was still much to be proud of. Thanks to the generous support and cooperation of writers and translators, during this period, we presented readers with a batch of highly acclaimed works: "Yellow River Flows East" (Li Jun), "Central Plains" (Zhou Yuan), "Youth is Only Once" (Yang Lian), "The Fool's Gate" (Yu Tianbai), "The Young Emperor" (Ling Li), "The Swordsman and the Woman" (Zhao Benfu), "Early Love" (Xiao Fuxing), "Bean Sheds and Melon Trellises in the Rain" (Liu Shaotang), "The Common People" (Hao Ran), "Muslim Funeral" (Huo Da), and foreign classics such as "One Hundred Years of Solitude" (Gabriel García Márquez) and "The Color Purple" (Alice Walker), among others. When our journal was praised by readers and friends in the literary world, we were proud of the writers and translators, and we also secretly shared in their glory—even if others might not have noticed or acknowledged it.

Of course, there were also regrets. Initially, the editorial department assigned me to contact Wang Meng, Wang Zengqi, Lin Jinluan, Deng Youmei, Zhong Jieying, and Su Shuyang. I eagerly accepted the task. Unfortunately, my influence did not compare to that of Mr. Wei Junyi. Wang Meng's "The Living and the Transformed" went to "Contemporary." At the time, he did console me, saying, "Let's wait until later." Later, when he became an official, although his new works kept coming, the possibility of writing a long novel while serving as a minister was slim. Wang Zengqi planned to write about his hometown. He modestly said that it might not be very interesting, but he just wanted everyone to know that there was such a form of long novel. I immediately thought of Xiao Hong's "Hulan River," and urged him to start writing as soon as possible. He needed to return to his hometown to reminisce, but for several years, he was unable to do so. He remained healthy, but he was already close to seventy. Lin Jinluan had a draft, and I only heard him mention a few sentences, but I was already captivated by his novel's innovative form. However, this novelist still needed to refine and revise it, and he has yet to publish it. Deng Youmei wanted to write about the lives of people in the small alleys of Beijing, which was also something I eagerly awaited. In the letter I sent him a few days ago, I mentioned this matter. Now, the hope of using their works to win back readers and enhance the reputation of "Long Novels" has all vanished with the journal's demise.

Our press has never been afraid of publishing money-losing books, but last year, most new books were already at a loss, and the higher-ups had no choice but to make the tough decision. Just as some presses require authors to secure sponsorship before publishing—all out of necessity. I also thought about finding sponsors for our "Long Novels," but Chinese entrepreneurs are not wealthy, and after being torn apart by "sponsorship," they are also unable to care for culture.

Think about it: a district worker's cultural palace was once filled with cigarette cans and dried fruits, used as a venue for a New Year's food order fair; a grand museum is bustling with the sale of new furniture; some primary and secondary school classrooms have been converted into inns, and teachers are busy sweeping, making beds, and cleaning spittoons; you—"Long Novels"—and the countless manuscripts that might not see the light of day due to potential losses—what is there to be ashamed of? What is there to be indignant about?

Life and death are predetermined, and so it is with journals. Some live, some die. Perhaps you should not have any complaints. Moreover, literary journals and those masquerading as literary journals are as numerous as the hairs on a cow, and it is indeed time for a cleanup, to cull a batch. But you are healthy, neither infected with venereal disease nor suffering from homicidal mania, nor are you a carrier of the AIDS virus. You are pure and honest, you died unjustly! Perhaps this is something to take comfort in. Rest in peace, the unfortunate "Long Novels"!

　　悼季刊《长篇小说》
    母国政
    北京十月文艺出版社编辑出版的季刊《长篇小说》，终于寿终正寝了。
    这件事并不突然。近两年文艺图书市场急遽萎缩。它的印数亦每况愈下，到印刷上一期杂志，我们不得不恳请作者协助发行时，结局已经注定了。
    它诞生于新时期文学生机勃勃的１９８３年。
    １９８２年冬，中国大多数作家正埋头于中短篇小说创作时，北京出版社（北京十月文艺出版社为其分社）为推动长篇小说创作，召开了北京长篇小说座谈会。当时在京的部分文坛精英都光临了，周扬同志也到会支持。那次会议的直接成果，便是《长篇小说》杂志于翌年创刊。作为定期出版的、专门登载长篇小说的刊物，在国内，它是第一个。
    它生存了５年。这５年文坛上的风风雨雨，自然也波及到我们编辑部里，出版过程中种种无谓的麻烦也不时骚扰我们。
    但气恼归气恼，欣慰还是主要的。承蒙作家和翻译家们的鼎力支持与合作，这期间，我们向读者奉献了一批获得广泛好评的佳作：《黄河东流去》（李準）、《中原大地》（周原）、《青春只有一次》（杨镰）、《愚人之门》（俞天白）、《少年天子》（凌力）、《刀客和女人》（赵本夫）、《早恋》（肖复兴）、《豆棚瓜架雨如丝》（刘绍棠）、《苍生》（浩然）、《穆斯林葬礼》（霍达），及外国名著《百年孤独》（马尔克斯）、《紫色》（艾丽丝·沃克）等等。当我们的刊物受到读者和文艺界朋友们的称赞时，我们为作家和翻译家骄傲，同时也暗自分享其中的一份荣光——尽管别人未必意识得到或者未必承认。
    当然也有遗憾。当初，编辑部分配我联系王蒙、汪曾祺、林斤澜、邓友梅、中杰英和苏叔阳，我欣然从命。可惜，我的面子不能与韦君宜先生相比，王蒙的《活动变人形》跑到了《当代》。他当时倒是安慰我，“等以后吧。”以后他当了官儿，新作虽然不断，在部长任上写长篇巨制的可能性却不大了。汪曾祺打算写他的家乡旧事。他自谦说，不一定有多大意思，只是想让大家知道，还有这样一种形式的长篇小说。我立时想起萧红的《呼兰河传》，遂敦促他尽快动笔。他需要回一次老家，重温旧梦，然而，几年始终不能成行。他依然清健，但毕竟年近古稀了。林斤澜已有初稿，我只听他讲了几句，便被其新颖的形式所倾倒。但这位小说艺术家却还要琢磨，还要修改，至今不肯出手。邓友梅要写的北京小胡同里的众生相，也是我亟盼拿到的。在我前两天给他的信中，还提到此事。……现在，想用他们的力作挽回读者并为《长篇小说》增辉的一切愿望，都随着刊物的夭折化作泡影了。
    我们出版社一向不怕出赔钱书的，然而去年已经是大部分新书亏本的窘况下，头儿们也只有狠下杀手了。正像有的出版社让作者先拉赞助再发稿一样——都是迫于无奈。我也曾想为我们的《长篇小说》拉些赞助，可是中国的企业家们并不富有，在他们已经被“赞助”撕裂得狼狈不堪时，他们也无力顾及文化了。
    想想吧，某区工人文化宫曾经摆满了香烟罐头、干鲜果品，被用来当做春节副食品订货会的会场；堂堂的博物馆正红红火火地展销新式家具；一些中小学的教室改做旅店，老师们正忙于扫地铺床刷痰桶；你——《长篇小说》以及因可能赔钱不得问世的众多书稿——还有什么可委屈的呢？还愤愤不平吗？
    生死由命，刊物也如此。有生的、有死的，或许你不该有抱怨。更何况文学刊物和打着“文学期刊”的刊物多如牛毛，确实该整顿一番，该砍一批。可是，你是健康的，既没有染上花柳病，也没有患凶杀狂症，更不是艾滋病毒携带者，你清清白白，你老老实实，你是死于非命的呵！——或许，这倒是可以自慰的。安息吧，在劫难逃的《长篇小说》！
