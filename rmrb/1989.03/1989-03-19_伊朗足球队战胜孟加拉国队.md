Iran's football team defeated Bangladesh in a match held today in Tehran for the 1990 World Cup Asian zone qualifying round, Group 5, with a score of 1-0.

The first half of the match saw neither team scoring. In the second half, Iran launched frequent attacks and finally scored a goal.

Despite the victory, the team's coach was not satisfied. He believed that the Iranian team only broke the deadlock in the final six minutes of the game, failing to demonstrate the technical level they should have.

　　伊朗足球队战胜孟加拉国队
    新华社德黑兰三月十七日电  （记者赵毅）伊朗队今天在这里进行的一九九○年世界杯足球赛亚洲区预选赛第五组比赛中，以一比○战胜了孟加拉国队。
    上半时比赛两队均无建树。下半时伊朗队频频发动猛攻，终于踢进一球。
    尽管伊朗队获胜，该队教练对此并不满意。他认为，伊朗队在终场前六分钟才攻破对方球门，没有发挥该队应有的技术水平。
