Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, March 11th

With the gradual rise in temperature and the arrival of fresh vegetables, the ancient city of Lanzhou on the high plateau is facing the risk of spoilage for over three million kilograms of stored cabbage.

Currently, Lanzhou still has more than ten million kilograms of stored cabbage. It is estimated that by the end of March, at most only seven million kilograms can be sold, and the rest may rot in the storage pits. To minimize the loss, the Lanzhou Municipal Vegetable Management Bureau is sending people to other provinces to promote sales and hopes that residents will consume more cabbage.

　　兰州窖藏白菜面临腐烂危险
    据新华社兰州三月十一日电  （记者王云峰）随着气温逐渐升高和鲜菜陆续上市，高原古城兰州将有三百多万公斤大白菜面临腐烂的危险。
    目前，兰州市还有一千多万公斤窖藏大白菜，预计到三月底最多只能销出七百余万公斤，其余可能烂在菜窖。为了把损失减少到最小程度，兰州市蔬菜管理局一方面派人去外省推销，同时希望居民多吃白菜。
