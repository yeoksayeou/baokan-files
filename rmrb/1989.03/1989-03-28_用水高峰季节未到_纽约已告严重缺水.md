Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 27th.

	New York is experiencing an unusually early and severe water shortage, prompting the city to implement emergency water-saving measures. Although it is not yet the peak water usage season, the city's reservoirs are already half empty, presenting the most severe water shortage in the city's history. Experts warn that even with strict water rationing, water supply could decrease by 20% to 25% during the upcoming summer.

	To address the water shortage, New York City has implemented several emergency water-saving measures. These include closing decorative fountains, limiting the use of air conditioning in government buildings and businesses, prohibiting watering of lawns and gardens, banning the filling of swimming pools, and prohibiting car washing. The city government has also called on residents to reduce shower and bath times and to install water-saving devices in bathrooms. These measures are expected to save 20% of water usage and will remain in effect until the end of summer. Additionally, the city plans to use water from the Hudson River to alleviate the immediate crisis.

	To ensure the effectiveness of these water-saving measures, the city will form 250 inspection teams to monitor compliance. Violations of the water-saving measures will result in a $500 fine.

	New York has experienced water shortages in 1961, 1981, and 1985, but the current situation is the most severe. The shortage is due to a lack of rain and snow last winter, particularly the absence of snow in the Catskill Mountains. Typically, 90% of New York City's water supply in the spring comes from melting snow in the mountains, but this year, the mountains have seen little snow. Additionally, increased water usage has exacerbated the supply problem.

	In 1965, New York City residents used 49 billion liters of water per day, but now the daily consumption has risen to 57 billion liters.

	Local water experts point out that the most practical and effective solution to New York City's water shortage, with a population of over 7 million, is to control and conserve water usage.

### 用水高峰季节未到  纽约已告严重缺水

　　用水高峰季节未到        
    纽约已告严重缺水
    新华社北京３月２７日电  （记者秦德岐）纽约的３月乍暖还寒，在这并非用水的高峰季节该市已严重缺水而不得不采取紧急节水措施。
    纽约是美国最大的城市，目前向市区供水的蓄水池的水量已减少了一半，该市面临有史以来最为严峻的缺水局面。专家们指出，在即将来到的夏季，即令在严格控制用水的情况下，供应该市的水量还将减少２０％到２５％。
    面对缺水，纽约市已采取了紧急节约用水措施。这些措施有：关闭观赏用的喷水池、限制机关和企业使用空调的时间、禁止向草坪和花园浇水、不得向游泳池放水、禁止用水洗涤汽车等。纽约市政府还号召居民减少洗澡和淋浴的时间，在盥洗室安装控制水流的节水箱以替代老式的水箱。这些节水措施将持续到今年夏末，估计这些措施可节约２０％的用水。此外，纽约市当局还计划引用赫德森河的河水以解燃眉之急。
    为了使节水措施真正实施，该市即将组建２５０个巡逻队专门检查节水情况。对于违犯节水措施者要处以５００美元的罚款。
    纽约在１９６１、１９８１和１９８５年也曾出现过供水不足，但是像今春这样严重缺水的情况还从未遇到过。这次缺水是由于去年冬天缺少雨雪，特别是卡茨基尔山缺少降雪造成的。在常年的春季，纽约市淡水蓄水池９０％的水源来自山地融化的雪水，而去冬今春以来，卡茨基尔山山坡基本上未盖覆雪。此外，用水量增加也加剧了供水困难。
    在１９６５年，纽约市市民每日的用水量为４９亿升，而现在每天的耗水量则上升到了５７亿升。
    当地的水利专家指出，要解决７００多万人口纽约市的缺水问题，在当前最为现实和有效的措施只能是控制用水，节约用水。
