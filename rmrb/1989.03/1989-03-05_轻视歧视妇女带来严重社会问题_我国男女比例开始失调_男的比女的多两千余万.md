Disregard and Discrimination Against Women Lead to Serious Social Problems
Sex Ratio Imbalance Begins in China
Men Outnumber Women by Over 20 Million

New China News Agency Beijing March 4 — Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the All-China Women's Federation Chen Muxia recently revealed in an interview with the reporter of "Party Building" that due to the discrimination against women, China has begun to show a sex ratio imbalance. Women account for 48.9% of the population, while men account for 51.1%. If this trend continues, it means that in the future, there will be tens of millions of men who will not be able to find wives.

Chen Muxia said that this is a serious social problem, but many people still do not recognize it.

Chen Muxia mentioned this situation while discussing women's participation in politics and decision-making, as well as issues related to employment and education. Chen Muxia said that the phenomenon of disregarding and discriminating against women is also prominent in the issue of education.

Chen Muxia said that women's participation in politics and decision-making is not as good as in the past. Currently, women make up approximately 21% of the National People's Congress representatives, and 9% of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. From the central to local levels, there are very few female cadres in leadership positions in various departments. Women's political status does not match the status they should have in a socialist country with over 10 billion people.

Chen Muxia said that now, with the optimization of the labor force and contract responsibility systems in enterprises, many female workers have been "optimized" off their positions. This has economic reasons, but also ideological reasons. She said that women giving birth to children is not just a personal matter for women, but a social responsibility to reproduce the next generation. Women pay a heavy price in both physiology and psychology for this and should be understood, acknowledged, and supported by society, rather than being seen as a burden, let alone a reason for discriminating against women.

Chen Muxia said that the Women's Federation is a bridge between the Party and the masses and should boldly advocate for women's legal rights. At the same time, it should also do more work that benefits women. She said that to meet the needs of the new historical period, the work of the Women's Federation should also be reformed and the women's liberation movement should be raised to a new level.

　　轻视歧视妇女带来严重社会问题
    我国男女比例开始失调 
    男的比女的多两千余万
    新华社北京３月４日电  全国人大常委会副委员长、全国妇联主席陈慕华日前在接受《党建》记者采访时透露，由于歧视妇女，目前我国已开始出现男女比例失调，女的占人口的４８．９％，男的占５１．１％。这样发展下去，意味着将来会有几千万娶不上妻子的男光棍。
    陈慕华说，这是一个严重的社会问题，可是现在不少人还没有认识到。
    陈慕华是在谈到妇女参政议政以及就业、教育等方面的问题时讲到这一情况的。陈慕华说，在受教育问题上，轻视、歧视妇女的现象也较突出。
    陈慕华说，妇女参政议政的情况不如过去。现在全国人大代表，妇女约占２１％，人大常委，妇女占９％，从中央到地方，各级部门领导岗位上的女干部极少。妇女的政治地位同我们１０多亿人口的社会主义国家中妇女应有的地位不大相称。
    陈慕华说，现在企业实行优化劳动组合，搞承包，不少女工被从岗位上“优化”下来。这有经济上的原因，但也有观念上的原因。她说，妇女生育孩子不是妇女个人的事，而是为繁衍后代尽社会责任。妇女为此在生理上、精神上都要付出重大代价，应该得到社会的理解承认和支持，而不应视为包袱，更不应成为歧视妇女的理由。
    陈慕华说，妇联组织是党联系群众的纽带，要理直气壮地为争取妇女的合法权益大声疾呼，同时，也应多做一些对妇女有益的工作。她说，为了适应新的历史时期的需要，妇联工作也要改革，要把妇女解放运动提高到新水平。
