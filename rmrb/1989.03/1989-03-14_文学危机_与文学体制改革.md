There has been a gradual increase in the number of people who have given a low-key assessment of literature over the past two years. Especially since the second half of last year, those who say that literature is trending towards weakness, a low point, or a crisis have become quite common. Indeed, just as people were enthusiastically promoting the first ten years of literature in the new era and anticipating an even more wonderful second decade, the literary world has already sensed some discomfort. Issues such as the shrinking social influence of literature, the sharp decline in the circulation of literary books, magazines, and newspapers, the financial difficulties and restless hearts of literary organizations, and the sudden lack of concreteness and strength in the promise that literature would no longer serve politics or be arbitrarily interfered with, have even led to a macro-consciousness in the literary world, namely the so-called "impact of the commodity economy on literature."

The Chinese people have a history of being impacted by politics, so it is not difficult to understand the specific psychological emotions contained in the literary world's so-called "impact." Moreover, whether it is resentment or resistance, there is still some logic to it.

One very common and influential complaint is directed at the literary circle itself, at other colleagues. It is said that the current cold treatment of literature, or its "low point," is a retaliation against a part of the writers' works that pursue "no theme, no plot, no characters," and strive for novelty and obscurity. This view, though somewhat biased, does suggest a way to improve the literary situation, that is: adjusting the internal structure of literature, or in other words, the literary world conducting self-regulation.

Now, the literary world no longer views the shrinkage of the literary market as an insignificant issue. Seeing that the general public, due to the expansion of outlets for expression and life content, has correspondingly reduced their emotional connection with literature, and seeing that literary books and magazines, under the pressure of rising costs, have led to a considerable number of readers reluctantly giving up, literature is no longer self-righteous. The literary world's attention to itself has increasingly become a priority.

For a long time, the literary world has regarded the "boom" of the early 1980s as the achievement of literature and the normal state of the literary market. Although the term "boom period" itself acknowledges that literary creation's production capacity will fluctuate, the hundreds of publishing houses, thousands of literary magazines, and tens of thousands of professionals and their various institutions and organizations that emerged at that time have remained and continued to expand. Although the literary situation is not good in recent years, the considerable scale of the "literary world" has not shown any intention of shortening the line, and wise people continue to advocate the logic of "speeding up and expanding." For example, compared to the Soviet Union, we have a larger population but fewer professional writers, and the proportion of the population is even smaller; compared to the West, we publish fewer books, fewer magazines, and fewer newspapers, etc. However, this kind of high talk that replaces reality with possibility and objective analysis with logical reasoning has basically ignored the historical determinants of national strength, per capita consumption level, general cultural literacy, and the society's potential for literary consumption. Thus, we see that the "boom period" has become a thing of the past, but the "stalls" that adapt to it continue to operate with relish. However, now even the "masterpieces" recognized by writers are barely one in ten; even the "key books" recognized by publishers are barely one in ten; even the "lead articles" and "second lead articles" recognized by magazine editors are barely one in ten; the rest are the increasingly rampant "manuscript wars," "writer wars," dual compensation for a single manuscript, multiple names for a single book, and other evils. In this sense, the current state of maintaining "speeding up and expanding" has degenerated into a literary deluge or a malignant expansion of the literary world that emphasizes quantity over quality.

Compared to the normal production capacity and consumption power, the literary world is too large. It can quickly shrink because there is "the state" providing the means to get by, and because the "world" is full of people who eat "imperial rations" as lifelong employees. It is worth noting that even in today's world, even economically developed countries do not include all literary people in the national system, nor do they regard the daily expenses of all literary organizations and institutions and the salaries and benefits of literary professionals as a constant official expenditure. If this can be seen as a historical determinant of the level of contemporary productive forces, national strength, and economic strength, reflecting the normal relationship between economy, politics, and literature; then, our literary world, which has always been included in the national system and can eat imperial rations and receive official salaries, is essentially the relationship between literature and politics, and is a result of the history of literature serving politics and "politics leading everything." Although after the end of the Cultural Revolution, we have basically achieved a transformation from "literature serving politics and being subordinate to politics" to literature serving the people and socialism in the realm of ideological consciousness, literary creation, and theoretical criticism, this rectification of chaos has at least not reached the same level of awareness and depth in reflecting on our current literary system. Therefore, when society begins to transform from a "political-centered structure" to an "economic-political-centered structure" or an "economic-centered structure," the literary world, due to a lack of ideological preparation, feels its foundation is unstable and passively bears the so-called "impact of the commodity economy on literature," passively understanding the real social movement's severe challenge to the original literary mechanism. Thus, a contradictory dynamic appears: on the one hand, the literary world, in its creative thinking activities and their results, all show enthusiasm and awareness for the current reforms; on the other hand, literary institutions, organizations, and full-time workers often reveal their true feelings of hoping to continue to maintain the system of receiving official salaries and enjoying lifelong tenure. Although facing the reality of literature, the literary world has tried some difficult but also ineffective "reforms," these self-adjustments are basically based on the premise and destination of not changing the existing literary system, "not demolishing the temple" and even rarely "reducing the number of monks," and thus have not truly freed the literary world from the passive and "impacted" situation.

Fortunately, the literary world can no longer "meet change with stasis," and even clinging to the remnants is somewhat beyond its strength. Since 1984, most city-level literary magazines have had their official funds revoked and have been transformed into self-sustaining literary production and operating units, thus producing true "literary commodities" and corresponding market economic mechanisms; various literary publishing houses, which have always had an enterprise nature, face competition and increasingly clearly regard "economic benefits" as the basis of "social benefits." Almost all literary institutions, organizations, and literary professionals no longer regard enjoying "official funds" and "imperial rations" as satisfactory, thus there are collective activities such as soliciting sponsorship, selling space, and "literature supporting literature," "commerce supporting literature," and there are individual activities such as "abandoning literature for commerce," "literature and commerce," and various forms of "literary activities" with the goal of making money. From these examples of the state no longer "supporting" and no longer being able to support, the literary world may only be able to provoke resentment such as "forcing good people into prostitution," but objectively, it has at least taken a step towards self-sufficiency and towards the large commodity economy system.

The literary world cannot forever "have one foot in each boat," and in its original intention, it is even more unwilling to leave or be squeezed out of the "official boat." Even if many comrades can acknowledge in theory that the existing literary system does not conform to our national strength, they do not want to "descend" to true freelancers in terms of sentiment and actual gains and losses. Because this would mean that many people would no longer enjoy an "iron rice bowl" and would no longer enjoy real or possible official benefits (including titles and positions, ranks, and public expenses, etc.). In addition, the literary world also sincerely believes that changing the existing literary system is equivalent to fundamentally dismantling or abolishing the literary world, which will inevitably lead to the shrinkage or decline of literature. Therefore, people are eager to criticize "forcing good people into prostitution" and the "flood" of vulgar literature, and to emphasize the importance of "regulating the literary environment." However, the demise of the "official literary world" does not necessarily equal, and even less necessarily lead to, the decline and destruction of literature. Here, positive examples such as Mr. Ba Jin of our country, and foreign masters such as Balzac and Hemingway, do not rely on "imperial rations" for their livelihood; Western writers and literary organizations that do not enjoy official subsidies have not built the "modernist literature" that our literary world highly admires? In recent years, when our relevant departments were rectifying "vulgar literature," were they not using some clauses formulated by the Western legal and literary worlds as part of the reference? Since the founding of the country, some of our old writers have tried to truly and deeply reflect on certain large-scale political movements, and for this, they were not afraid to move their entire families, go deep into the grassroots, and stay rooted for a long time. However, the "awareness" and identity of "cadres" made it impossible for them to truly feel society and life like ordinary workers and peasants, or to be freer and more autonomous to transcend and overlook the social movements of the time, thus leaving obvious shortcomings in their creation. The constant emphasis on "deepening into life" and the frequent inefficiency, is it not related to the fact that many people in our literary world have a special privilege of "not asking about worldly affairs" and find it difficult to get rid of this "identity" limitation?

If, during the "cooperative movement," our writers observed the countryside and peasants with the identity of cadres, it was inevitable that they would "scratch the itch through the shoe"; then, during the Cultural Revolution, our literary world could only experience life with the general public and gave birth to the later "boom" situation. Today, the process of reform has touched the existing literary system; the literary world will gradually lose the "privilege" of standing aloof, watching from the sidelines, or observing from the side, which is not necessarily a bad thing for our literary creation and theoretical criticism. Therefore, we have reason to believe that the literary world, in the face of the gradual shrinkage and collapse of the existing literary system, will inevitably make extremely clear and self-aware choices!

　　“文学危机”与文学体制改革
     绿雪
    对近两年的文学做低调评估的同志渐渐增加。特别是去年下半年以来，说文学趋向疲软、低谷、萧条或是危机的，竟很普遍。的确，还在人们热忱地鼓吹新时期文学的头十年与想必是更美妙的第二个十年之际，文学界已经品出几分不自在。诸如文学的社会影响力萎缩，文学书刊报纸的销量锐减，文学团体入不敷出、人心浮动，对于文学不再为政治服务也不再被横加干涉的允诺突然变得不比感受经济的压力与金钱的魔力那般具体那样强劲等等，甚至促成了文学界的一种宏观意识，即所谓“商品经济对于文学的冲击”。
    国人多有受政治“冲击”的履历，因而不难领悟文学界所谓“冲击”中包含的特定心理情绪。况且，艾怨也罢，抵触也罢，都还未必讲不出道理。
    其中一种很常见也很有影响的抱怨，是冲着文坛内部、冲着另一些同行而来的。据说，目前文学受冷遇也好，“低谷”也好，莫不是对一部分作家作品追逐“无主题、无情节、无人物”，争奇斗谲、晦涩难懂的报复。这种看法，虽不无偏颇，但是它却提出或提示了一种改善文学处境的思路，即：调整文学的内在格局，或者说，文学界进行自我调节。
    如今，文学界不再把文学市场的萎缩视为无关痛痒的问题了。看到社会公众由于宣泄渠道和生活内容得以拓展而相应减损了与文学的感情联系，看到文学书刊迫于成本的涨价而导致相当数量的读者忍痛割爱，文学不再自恃清高，文学界对自身的重视日益提到日程上来。
    长期以来，我们文学界一向把８０年代初期的“繁荣”看作文学的功绩和文学市场的常态。尽管“井喷期”这种提法本身默认了文学创作的生产能力会时高时低地波动，但是，彼时应运而生的百来家出版社、成千个文学报刊、十来万从业人员及其组成的各类机构团体，却留存下来并继续扩大。尽管近年文学处境不妙，规模颇为可观的“文学界”却迄未流露缩短战线的意愿，而且有识之士尚不断地申说“大干快上”的道理。例如，比苏联，我们人口多而专业作家少，所占人口比例更少；比西方，我们出的书少，办的刊物少、印的报纸少等等；但是，这类以可能性代替现实性、以逻辑推理代替客观分析的高论，却基本忽视了国力、人均消费水准、普遍的文化素养和社会的文学消费潜力等历史规定性。于是我们看到，“井喷期”已成明日黄花，与之相适应的“摊点”却继续有滋有味地经营着。然而，如今即使作家自认的“力作”，已什不足一；即使出版社自认的“重点书”，亦什不足一；即使报刊编辑部自认的“头题”、“二题”之作，亦什不足一；此外，便是愈演愈烈的“抢稿战”、“抢人（作家）战”、一稿两酬、一书多名等等弊端。就此而言，勉力维系着的“大干快上”的现状，已蜕变为“重数量轻质量”的文学大泛滥或曰文学界的恶性膨胀。
    与常态的生产能力和消费能量相比未免过于庞大的文学界，可以不因文学“井喷期”结束、文学市场萎缩而迅速缩小，在于有“国家”提供聊以度日的经费，在于此“界”众生多是吃“皇粮”的终生雇员。耐人寻味的是：当今之世，即便是经济发达的国家，也并不把文学界中人统统纳入国家编制，也并不把一切文学团体机构的日常开销、文学从业人员的工资福利等等统统当作一项恒常的官方开支。如果说，这可以看作当代生产力发展水平、国力和经济实力的一种历史规定性，体现了经济、政治、文学之间的正常关系；那么，我们的一向列入国家编制的、可以吃皇粮拿官俸的文学界（包括各类机构团体和专职从业人员）与“国家”的关系，实质上则是文学与政治的关系，则是由文学为政治服务、“政治统帅一切”的历史所造成。尽管“文革”结束后，我们在思想意识的层次、在文学创作和理论批评范围内，基本实现了从“文学服务于政治、从属于政治”到文学为人民服务、为社会主义服务的转变，但是，这种拨乱反正，至少是没有在反省我国现行的文学体制等方面达到同等的自觉与深刻。因此，当社会开始由“政治中心结构”向“经济——政治中心结构”或是“经济中心结构”转型时，文学界由于缺乏思想准备而痛感根基不稳，被动地承受所谓“商品经济对于文学的冲击”，消极地理解现实的社会运动对于原有文学机制的严峻挑战。于是出现了一种自相矛盾的动态：一方面，文学界在自己的创造性思维活动及其成果中，莫不表现了对于当前改革的热忱和自觉；另一方面，文学机构团体和专职工作人员，又时时流露企盼继续地维系拿官俸吃皇粮享有终身制的真情实感。尽管面对文学的现实境遇，文学界先后尝试了某些难能可贵却也成效甚微的“改革”，但是，这类自我调整，基本上是以不改变现存文学体制、“不拆庙”甚至也很少“裁和尚”为前提和归宿的，也因而并未使文学界真正摆脱被动的和受“冲击”的局面。
    幸运的是，文学界已不可能“以不变应万变”了，甚至连抱残守缺也有些力不从心了。１９８４年开始，地市级文学期刊大多被褫夺了官方经费，转化为自负盈亏的文学的生产机构和经营单位，从而产生了真正的“文学商品”和相应的市场经济机制；各类文学出版社，一向兼有企业性质，面对竞争，越发明确地把“经济效益”作为“社会效益”的基础。几乎所有的文学机构团体和文学从业人员，如今都不再以享有“官费”、“皇粮”为满足，于是有了集体的向企业家化募拉赞助卖版面与“以文养文”、“以商养文”之类经济活动，也有了个人的“弃文经商”、“亦文亦商”与各式各样的以赚钱为目标的“文学活动”。从这些国家不再“养”与不再养得住的事例中，文学界或许还只能引发诸如“逼良为娼”之类艾怨，客观上，毕竟朝自食其力、朝商品经济大系统迈出了一条腿。
    文学界不可能永远“脚踩两只船”，就其本意来说，更是不愿离开或被挤出“官船”的。即使许多同志都可以在理论上承认现存的文学体制并不顺乎我们的国力，在感情上也在实际功利得失上，不愿“沦”为真正意义上的自由职业者。因为，这将意味着许多人不再享有“铁饭碗”、不再享有现实的或可能的官方权益（包括职称和职务，级别及其公费待遇等等）。此外，文学界也真诚地认为：改变现存的文学体制，等于从根本上瓦解或是取消了文学界，这必然导致文学的萎缩或沦落。因此，人们热衷于针砭“逼良为娼”和“庸俗文学”的“泛滥”，痛陈“治理文学环境”的重要意义。然而，“官办文学界”的消亡，未必等于更未必导致文学的沦落与毁灭。这里正面的例子，如我国的巴金先生、外国的巴尔扎克、海明威等大师，都并不靠“皇粮”度日；不享有官方津贴的西方作家和文学团体，不是建树了我国文学界颇为推崇的“现代派文学”吗？近年间我国有关部门在整肃“庸俗文学”时，不是把西方司法界和文学界制定的某些条款作为一部分参照吗？建国以来，我们的一些老作家力图真实而深刻地反映某些大规模的政治运动，并且为此不惜举家搬迁，深入基层，长期扎根，然而，“干部”的“觉悟”和身份，使他们无法真正像普通的工人农民那样感受社会人生，或者更自由更自主地超越和俯瞰当时的社会运动，从而给他们的创作留下显而易见的缺憾。“深入生活”的不断强调与每每事倍功半，难道不是与我们的文学界中人多有一种“不问人间烟火”的特殊权益和难以摆脱这种“身份”的局限有关吗？
    如果说：“合作化运动”时，我们的作家以干部的身份从旁观察农村和农民，以致难免“隔靴搔痒”；那么，到了“文革”，我们的文学界则只能与社会公众一道体验人生，并且派生了日后的“井喷”局面。今天，改革的进程，已触动了现存的文学体制；文学界将逐渐丧失置身事外、隔岸观火或从旁观察的“特权”，这对于我们的文学创作和理论批评来说未必是坏事。因此，我们有理由相信：文学界，对于现存文学体制的渐趋萎缩、轰毁，势必有极为清醒极为自觉的抉择的！
