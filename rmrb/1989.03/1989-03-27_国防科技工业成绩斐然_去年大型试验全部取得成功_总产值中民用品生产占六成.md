China's defense science and technology industry made significant progress last year. Vice Chairman of the State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense Shen Rongjun and Deputy Director of the Science and Technology Commission of the State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense Nie Li revealed during the discussions at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress that China's defense science and technology industry completed the progress plans for 29 key research projects last year. More than 1,700 pre-research topics scheduled for the Seventh Five-Year Plan period were completed, with some projects reaching world-class levels.

The two generals in charge of the defense science and technology industry introduced that last year was the year with the most large-scale experiments in the history of China's defense science and technology industry, and all these experiments were successful. These included the launch of two geostationary orbit communication satellites, one sun-synchronous orbit meteorological satellite, and one recoverable satellite; the underwater launch of missiles by nuclear submarines and certain tactical missile launches; as well as more than 100 conventional weapon tests and a large number of wind tunnel tests.

The two generals said that the defense science and technology industry exceeded the state plan last year, with civilian product production accounting for 60% of the total industrial output value.

They emphasized that the development of defense science and technology is closely related to the country's status, and it is necessary to implement protective policies for the defense science and technology industry and explore the operating mechanism for the defense science and technology industry in peacetime. When discussing how to solve the problem of insufficient funds, they expressed that it is necessary to carry forward the spirit of "self-reliance and hard work," shorten the battle lines, focus on key areas, and use the limited funds on critical points.

　　国防科技工业成绩斐然        
    去年大型试验全部取得成功     
    总产值中民用品生产占六成
    据新华社北京３月２６日电  （记者李志勇、羊慧明）中国国防科技工业去年取得长足进展。国防科工委副主任沈荣骏和国防科工委科技委副主任聂力在七届全国人大二次会议讨论时透露，中国国防科技工业去年完成了２９个重点研制项目的进度计划。国家“七五”计划期安排的预研课题完成了１７００多项，有的项目达到世界先进水平。
    这两位主管国防科技工业的将军介绍，去年是中国国防科技工业史上大型试验最多的一年，这些试验全部取得成功。其中包括发射两颗地球同步轨道通信卫星、一颗太阳同步轨道气象卫星、一颗返回式卫星；核潜艇水下发射导弹以及某些战术导弹发射；还有１００多项常规武器试验和大量风洞试验。
    两位将军说，国防科技工业去年超额完成了国家计划，民品生产占国防科技工业生产总值的比重上升到６０％。
    他们强调，国防科技的发展与国家地位紧密相关，有必要对国防科技工业实行保护政策，探索和平时期国防科技工业的运行机制。在谈到如何解决经费短缺问题时，他们表示，要发扬“自力更生、艰苦奋斗”精神，缩短战线，突出重点，把有限的经费用在刀刃上。
