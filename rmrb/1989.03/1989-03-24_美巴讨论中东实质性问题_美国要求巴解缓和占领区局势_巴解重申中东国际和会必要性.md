U.S. and PLO Discuss Substantive Middle East Issues

U.S. Demands PLO Ease Tensions in Occupied Territories

PLO Reiterates Necessity of International Conference on the Middle East

U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau, and PLO representative, Abu al-Abbas, held their first substantive talks in Tunis on March 22. This was the second round of talks between the U.S. and the PLO since December 1988 and the first under President Bush's administration. The talks, which lasted over four hours, were held at a government guesthouse in the suburb of Carthage. No specific agreements were reached. After the talks, Pelletreau stated that the discussions were "in-depth and substantive," while al-Abbas said that "progress has been made."

The main issues discussed were how to reduce tensions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and promote peace negotiations. During the talks, the U.S. ambassador urged the PLO to take practical steps to ease tensions and create a political atmosphere conducive to negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis. The PLO representative pointed out that the root cause of the ongoing tensions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is Israel's occupation. He stressed that the U.S. has a responsibility to do everything possible to stop Israel's terrorism against the Palestinian people. He also demanded that the U.S. take steps to prepare for an international peace conference.

The PLO's chief representative and Executive Committee member, Abu al-Abbas, told the press after the talks that the discussions on the core issues of the Middle East peace process were of "special significance." He reiterated that the PLO believes an international peace conference is the only way to achieve a comprehensive and just resolution to the conflict.

Al-Abbas noted that there is a new situation in the quest for a comprehensive resolution to the Middle East conflict. The PLO has proposed several ideas for preparing for a Middle East conference. The U.S. should do everything in its power to stop the Israeli authorities from committing acts of terrorism against the Palestinian people. The uprising of the Palestinian people in the occupied territories will continue until their national rights are achieved. The PLO rejects holding elections under Israeli occupation.

The U.S. chief representative, U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia, Robert Pelletreau, stated, "Creating a suitable political atmosphere for direct talks between the Palestinians and Israelis and achieving positive results is the top priority." He said the main content of the talks was to ease tensions in the occupied territories, and the U.S. would do its best to promote direct talks between the Palestinians and Israelis based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338.

　　美巴讨论中东实质性问题        
    美国要求巴解缓和占领区局势 
    巴解重申中东国际和会必要性
    综合本报华盛顿、开罗３月２３日电  记者张启昕、林皎明报道：美国驻突尼斯大使罗伯特·佩利特鲁与巴勒斯坦解放组织代表阿布德·拉布３月２２日在突尼斯首都举行首次实质性会谈。这是自１９８８年１２月以来美巴举行的第二轮会谈，也是布什总统执政后的第一次会谈。会谈在郊区迦太基的一座政府宾馆举行，历时四个多小时。会谈未取得具体协议。会谈后，佩利特鲁称，双方进行了“深入的实质性的讨论”，拉布说，会谈“取得了进展”。
    这次会谈涉及的主要问题是如何减少西岸和加沙地带的紧张局势，促进和平谈判。会谈中，美国大使要求巴解组织采取实际步骤减缓紧张局势，以创造巴以谈判的政治气氛。巴解代表指出，西岸和加沙地带持续的紧张局势的根源是以色列的占领，美国有责任尽一切的可能努力制止以色列对巴勒斯坦人民的恐怖主义。同时，他要求美国为国际和平会议着手筹备工作。
    巴方首席代表、巴解执委会委员阿布德·拉布会后对外界宣布，这次会谈涉及中东和平进程的核心内容“具有特别意义”。他说，巴解组织重申中东和平国际会议是全面、公正解决争端的唯一途径。
    阿布德·拉布指出，全面和平解决中东争端已出现新的形势。巴解组织就筹备中东和会提出若干设想。美国应该尽一切努力阻止以色列当局对巴勒斯坦人民采取恐怖行为。被占领土巴勒斯坦人民起义斗争将坚持下去，直至实现民族权利。巴解组织拒绝在以色列占领状况下举行公民选举。
    美方首席代表、美国驻突尼斯大使罗伯特·佩利特鲁表示，“创造适宜的政治气氛进行巴以直接谈判，并取得积极成果，是当前首要的任务”。他说，这次会谈的主要内容有关缓和被占领土紧张局势，美方尽力促使巴以在２４２、３３８号决议基础上举行直接谈判。
