Reform – The Hope Lies Here

Guangxi People's Congress delegates say that rectification must proceed under the premise of adhering to the overall direction of reform

By Reporter Lü Fang

“How difficult it has been to achieve today's reform momentum and for China to have today's vitality! Think back to the three difficult years in the early 1960s. Just take the household contract responsibility system in rural areas, which was achieved at the cost of the lives of so many peasant brothers… How can public servants not continue to hold high the banner of reform during the rectification?”

People's Congress delegate and Secretary of the Guangxi Guilin Administrative Office Jiang Yi spoke these words with a solemn expression and eyes shining with fervor.

In recent days, the reporter visited six delegates in the Guangxi delegation. They all shared Jiang Yi's sentiments, expressing deep satisfaction with Li Peng's reiteration in the government work report that "rectification and deepening reform must be closely combined." They also used their observations and experiences to explain that to do a good job of rectification, one must deepen the reform of the investment system, distribution system, and political system.

Many people in Guangxi know that Guixian has the largest sugar factory in the country. Originally, this large sugar factory was already struggling, but People's Congress delegate and Director of Pingshan County Water Heating Materials Factory Liang Huannin heard that a certain bureau in the locality wanted to build a new sugar factory through some investment channels. Old Liang shook his head and said, "If the investment system is not reformed, how can ineffective investments be controlled? How can we prevent everyone from rushing to start projects?" People's Congress delegate and Deputy Mayor of Liuzhou City Liu Zhibin exclaimed, "Regardless of whether the benefits are good or bad, various units compete to increase their consumption funds. One of the reasons is that the distribution system reform has not been deepened!"

Since last September, the state has tightened monetary policy, and people have paid more attention to the order in the monetary circulation field. To obtain a loan, how many business managers have fought for it. People's Congress delegate and Director of Liuzhou Machinery Factory Huang Renwu said: One way to solve this problem is still to deepen the reform. If, on the one hand, banks can determine the amount of loans based on the effective supply performance of each enterprise, and on the other hand, the government periodically publishes the direction of funds, it would help to ease the current loan tightness and correct the improper practices in fund allocation.

Yulin Region's export earnings account for one-quarter to one-third of the entire Guangxi. Li Sizhao, Secretary of the Yulin Regional Party Committee, is a People's Congress delegate. The reporter asked him, "I heard that now various kinds of 'speculators' are most active in trading permits for products with large domestic and international price differences. How do you think we can stop the trading of permits?" He replied without hesitation: "Reform! Make the method of administrative allocation of permits public! If the method of enterprises bidding for permits is adopted, the procedure will be open, which will help to prevent corruption."

During the interview, the reporter deeply felt the multifaceted nature of things. Deepening reform and rectification both have positive and negative effects. We can only weigh the two benefits and choose the heavier, and weigh the two harms and choose the lighter. In the economic environment where the old and new systems coexist and alternate, it is naive to think that one medicine can cure two diseases.

At the beginning of this year, People's Congress delegate and Mayor of Wuzhou City Huang Han Yun saw from some statistical figures that the city's overly fast economic growth rate had slowed down. This, of course, is the result of curbing overheating and should be affirmed. However, he took a closer look and found that Wuzhou's advantage and major foreign exchange earner—light textiles and daily necessities—had slowed down too much, while those enterprises that do not play a major role in ensuring effective supply and state fiscal revenue were still very hot. Huang Han Yun said: If we continue like this, will the industrial structure not become more and more unreasonable? On March 1st, Wuzhou City held the sixth session of the eighth People's Congress. Old Huang included a special section in his government work report: "Firmly advance enterprise reform." He called out loudly: If we do not resolutely implement mergers and establish enterprise groups, the so-called increase in effective supply of short-line and marketable products will be an empty talk!

### 改革——希望所在  广西人大代表说，整治要在坚持改革总方向前提下进行

　　改革——希望所在        
    广西人大代表说，整治要在坚持改革总方向前提下进行
    本报记者  鹿舫
    “改革能有今天这样的态势，中国能有今天这样的生机，是多么不容易哟！想想六十年代初的三年困难时期吧，单说一个农村家庭联产承包责任制，就是以多少农民兄弟的生命为代价换来的……人民公仆怎能不在治理整顿中继续高举改革大旗？”人大代表、广西桂林行署专员蒋毅在讲这番话时，神情是庄重的，眼里闪着挚热的光。
    近几天，记者在广西代表团访问了六位代表，他们都有蒋毅一样的心情，对李鹏总理在政府工作报告中再次重申“把治理整顿同深化改革密切结合起来”深表欣慰，并且以所见所闻说明搞好治理整顿，离不开深化投资体制、分配体制、政治体制改革。
    广西不少人知道，贵县建有我国最大的糖厂。本来这家大糖厂就吃不饱了，可是人大代表、平南县水暖器材厂厂长梁焕新听说，当地某个局又想通过某种投资渠道新建一座糖厂。老梁不禁连连摇头，说：“如果不进行投资体制改革，怎么能控制住无效投资？怎么能不叫大家争着上项目？”人大代表、柳州市副市长刘知炳击掌兴叹道：不管效益好坏，各单位消费基金比着涨，原因之一就在于分配体制的改革还没有深入！
    自去年九月以来，国家抽紧银根，人们更加关注货币流通领域的秩序。为争取一笔贷款，多少企业经营者挤破了头。人大代表、柳州机械厂厂长黄任武说：解决这个问题的途径之一，仍然是深化改革。假如一方面银行能根据各家企业创造的有效供给实绩确定贷款量，另一方面政府定期公布资金投向，那就能缓解目前的贷款紧张状况和纠正资金投放中的不正之风。
    玉林地区的出口创汇额占整个广西的四分之一到三分之一，中共玉林地委书记李思潮是人大代表。记者向他提了这样一个问题：“听说现在形形色色的‘倒爷’们倒得最厉害的是国内国外差价大的产品的批文。您认为怎样才能制止倒批文呢？”他毫不迟疑地回答：“改革！使行政分配批文的办法公开化！如果采取生产企业投标的办法分配批文，程序公开，将有助于杜绝营私舞弊。”
    记者在采访中深切地感受到事物的多侧面性。深化改革、治理整顿都是正副效应并存的。我们只能是两利相衡取其重，两弊相衡取其轻。在新旧两种体制并存和交替的经济环境中，想用一种药来治两种病，未免天真。
    今年初，人大代表、梧州市市长黄汉云从一些统计数字看出本市过快的经济增长速度有所下降，这当然是压缩过热空气的结果，应该肯定。但是他细一瞧，发现梧州的优势、创汇大项——轻纺、日用品增长速度下降过多，而那些对保证有效供给和国家财政收入不起主要作用的企业仍然很热。黄汉云说：这样下去，工业结构不是越来越不合理吗？今年三月一日梧州市举行八届人大六次会议。老黄在他的政府工作报告中专门写了一段——“坚定不移地推进企业改革”。他大声疾呼：如果我们不下决心实行兼并，组建企业集团，所谓增加短线和适销对路产品的有效供给，就是一句空话！
