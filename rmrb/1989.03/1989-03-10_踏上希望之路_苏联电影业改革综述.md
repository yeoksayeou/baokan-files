The Soviet Union is recognized worldwide as a major film-producing country, with 39 film studios producing approximately 150 feature films, 100 television films, over 1,000 documentary and educational films, and 130 animated films each year. However, behind these impressive figures lies a crisis in the film industry. In 1986 alone, the film industry incurred a loss of 3,900 rubles, and many films had attendance rates of less than 20%. Mediocre films and those that gloss over reality dominate the screen, and the industry is plagued by corruption.

Soviet filmmakers have recognized that the film management system, which relies heavily on administrative commands, is the root of the crisis. After extensive deliberation, a new basic model for film production and distribution was introduced last February. The specific measures are as follows:

1. Clearly define the scope of state guidance. The new model stipulates that the film industry should be jointly managed by the state and society. The official body overseeing film activities, the State Committee for Film Industry, does not interfere with the work of the studios but only performs strategic management functions. The state will support films with high ideological and artistic standards through state orders, but these orders should not exceed 25%.

2. Delegate authority. Studios and creative teams have full creative autonomy and do not need to go through multiple levels of approval.

3. Transition to economic management. Studios will implement economic accounting.

4. Implement a contract system, promoting merit-based employment.

5. Establish a film market. Replace the mandatory distribution of films with free selection. Studios, as sellers, are responsible not only for film production but also for the marketability of the films. Regularly hold various international film festivals to promote products to the global market. In January, a non-fiction film festival was held in Leningrad, where several film sales contracts were signed with foreign film companies, allowing previously overlooked documentaries to be exported and earn foreign exchange.

The film industry reform, which has just begun, faces resistance from two fronts. First, bureaucratic institutions continue to interfere with the activities of the studios, with state orders actually reaching 40%, thereby restricting the autonomy of the studios. Second, a group of film workers within the industry, affected by the reform wave, oppose the changes. According to the *Soviet Culture News*, hundreds of people at the Moscow Film Studio face the prospect of changing careers or unemployment. The biggest challenge for the reform is how to produce films with high ideological and artistic standards under the economic accounting system. Some scholars suggest that the state should establish a fund to support films that have low attendance rates but high artistic value and exploratory potential.

The reform of the Soviet film industry will not be smooth sailing. However, the reform has indeed broken through the closed and rigid management system, injecting new life into the Soviet film industry.

　　踏上希望之路
    ——苏联电影业改革综述
    熊伊瑂
    苏联是世界公认的电影大国，拥有３９家电影制片厂，每年生产约１５０部故事片、１００部电视片、１０００多部纪录片和科普片、１３０部动画片……然而在这令人惊叹的数字背后，隐藏着电影业的种种危机，仅１９８６年电影业就亏损３９００卢布，许多影片的上座率不足２０％。平庸之作和粉饰太平的影片充斥影坛，营私舞弊之风腐蚀着电影工作者。
    苏联电影工作者们认识到，以行政命令为基本特征的电影管理制度是危机的根源。经过反复酝酿，电影生产和发行的新的基本模式于去年２月问世。其具体作法是：
    １，明确国家指导的活动范围。新模式规定由国家和社会共同管理电影业。主管电影活动的官方机构国家电影业委员会不具体干涉制片厂的工作，它只担负战略性管理职能。以国家订货的方式扶植思想艺术水平高的影片，同时规定国家订货不得超过２５％。２，下放权力。制片厂和创作组拥有充分的创作自主权，无须层层审批。３，转向经济管理形式。制片厂实行经济核算。４，实行聘任制，优胜劣汰。５，开办电影市场。变影片硬性分配为自由选购。制片厂作为售片人不仅要对拍片负责，也要对影片是否有销路负责。同时定期开办各类国际电影节，向世界市场推销产品。今年１月在列宁格勒举办了非故事片国际电影节，与外国影视公司签订了一批售片合同，使过去无人问津的纪录片得以出口创汇。
    刚刚起步的电影业改革遇到了来自两方面的阻力。一是官僚主义机构对制片厂的活动依然横加干涉，国家订货实际上达到４０％，使制片厂的自主权受到干扰。二是电影工作者内部一批受到改革浪潮冲击的人反对改革，据《苏维埃文化报》介绍，仅莫斯科电影制片厂就有数百人面临改行和失业的威胁。改革受到的最大困扰是如何在经济核算制下拍出有高度思想艺术水平的影片。一些学者建议由国家设立一笔基金来资助那些上座率不高但具有较高艺术价值和探索性的影片。
    苏联电影业改革不会是一帆风顺的。但改革毕竟打破了封闭僵化的管理制度，为苏联电影业注入了生机。
