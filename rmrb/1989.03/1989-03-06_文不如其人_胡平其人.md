Title: His Writing Does Not Reflect His Person

The saying goes, "The writing reflects the person." However, there are exceptions to this rule. For instance, Hu Ping, who is sitting in front of me, is someone whose writing and personality seem to be at odds.

On the surface, he appears carefree and unkempt, with no regard for proper posture or appearance, and a protruding belly that he carries around as he walks. His writing, however, is quite different: serious, profound, and deep, completely unlike his carefree and indifferent demeanor. There's no need to read extensively; just take a look at his "Historical Reflections: Twenty Years After the Red Guards' Great Link-Up," and you can see that beneath his casual exterior lies a persistent and burdened soul. The absurd history that permeated a generation's dreams and pursuits is depicted in his writing with a heavy, bitter taste. Yet, he insists on revisiting it, thereby emitting a light of historical reflection and observation of reality. Reading his works, you won't find any lightheartedness; you'll only see a person who is extremely serious and earnest, wielding a heavy pen.

I heard that his collaborative work with Zhang Shengyou, "The Great Global Link-Up," had just won the first prize in the "China Wave Reportage Literature Contest." I went to see him at the Yuanwang Building Hotel. Seeing him slouched on the sofa, puffing away at his cigarette, I was even more convinced of my impression—his writing does not reflect his person. At the same time, I felt a sense of disorientation, not knowing what thoughts or actions he might suddenly come up with.

For example, he never writes essays, but one day, on a whim, he wrote his first essay, "Confessions of a Gourmet," which won the first prize in the "Youth" essay contest of the People's Daily. Later, he wrote another essay, "The Tobacco Company Won't Be Unemployed" (he is a heavy smoker himself), published in the Wen Hui Bao, and began to attract attention in the essay world, occasionally being referred to as a "master." For this, he once joked, "Becoming a master might not be difficult; a thousand-word essay is enough." But he doesn't want to join the essay crowd; he says he prefers reportage literature.

When people optimistically discuss the prospects of social problem reportage literature, he has some reservations. He believes that after the initial sensation, a predicament arises. Reportage literature needs to leap to new heights, breaking away from the herd mentality of describing the "Great Difficulties of China" and instead should delve into the historical, cultural, and philosophical aspects, writing about the direction of the times and the soul of the nation.

Seeing his persistent and meticulous attitude, I can't help but recall his catchphrase when he was a student at Fudan University: "Even if the iron gate stands for a thousand years, it will eventually be opened by a mud cake." This line is from "Dream of the Red Chamber," and he often said it when he was frustrated with his writing. However, he never transcended this frustration but instead delved deeper. Since 1985, when he joined the Chinese Writers Association, he has published one poetry collection and seven reportage literature collections (some co-authored with Zhang Shengyou), as well as two novellas and several short stories scattered in various major newspapers and magazines. This contradiction between transcendence and persistence perhaps reflects his dual personality?

From the 10th-floor window of the Yuanwang Building, looking out at the vast expanse, people seem like tiny beans. He gazed into the distance and told me that this year he plans to write a 150,000-word long reportage, using the experiences of two female Red Guards to radiate and observe history, reflecting on reality, and thus evaluating the fate and choices of this generation.

I asked, "Do you want to transcend the predicament of social problem reportage literature by integrating a historical and cultural consciousness?"

He replied, "There is that intention. Su Xiaokang says our nation is a nation that cannot afford to lose; I would add that our nation is a nation that forgets easily."

I had an epiphany. His writing does not reflect his person; his person is Hu Ping, a native of Jiangxi.

### 文不如其人——胡平其人

　　文不如其人
    ——胡平其人
    谭健
    文如其人，这是揆度常理之言。世上偏偏有常理难揆之事，比方坐在我面前的胡平吧，你就很难把他与他的作品统一起来。
    单看表面，一副落拓不羁、不修边幅的神气，坐无坐样，站无站相，腆着个早凸的肚子横着走路。他的作品却是另一副尊容：严肃、凝重、深沉，全然不是那一副玩世不恭和散淡的样子。勿庸多览，只要读一下他的《历史沉思录——红卫兵大串连二十周年祭》，就可以窥见在那副大大咧咧的外表下掩藏着的，是一个多么执著、负重的灵魂。那浸透了一代人的梦想与追求的荒诞历史，在他的笔下是那般沉甸苦涩，而他又偏要反复品嚼，从而放射出一种反思历史、观照现实的思想之光。读他的作品，没有轻松感，你只能看到一个极严肃认真的人在操一支沉重的笔杆。
    听说他与张胜友合作的《世界大串连》刚刚获得“中国潮报告文学征文”一等奖，我便去他下榻的远望楼宾馆看他。只见他松松垮垮瘫坐在沙发上吞云吐雾的情景，我更加坚定了对他的印象——文不如其人。同时袭上心头的是一种对不准焦距的感觉，你不知道他忽然会冒出什么思想，或是做出什么举动。
    比方他从来不写杂文，不知何时心血来潮，忽发奇想，抛出第一篇杂文《美食家自白》，居然一举获得人民日报“风华”杂文征文一等奖；俟后又写了一篇《烟草公司不会失业》（他本人就是大烟鬼），登在《文汇报》上，开始为杂文界瞩目，偶尔还以“家”称之。为此他曾自谑道：“当家也许不难，千字文足矣。”但他又不愿入杂文之伙，他说他更喜欢报告文学创作。
    当人们乐观地为社会问题报告文学展望前景时，他却颇有微词。他认为轰动过后带来的是困境，报告文学要向新的高度跃进，须得从一窝蜂似描写“中国大难产”的现状中脱离出来，而应当从历史、文化和哲学的高度，写出时代的走向，写出民族的灵魂来。
    目睹他这股执著较真的劲儿，不禁使我想到他在复旦园里就读时的一句口头禅：“纵使千年铁门限，终须一个土馒头。”这话引自《红楼梦》，说这话时，多半是为苦心爬格子所烦而生出的一种彻悟的自嘲。但是，他终于没有超脱出来，而陷得更深了。自１９８５年他进中国作协以来，已有一本诗集和７本报告文学集（有的与张胜友合作）问世，还有两个中篇小说和若干短篇散见于各大报刊。这种超脱与执著的矛盾或许就是他难以把握的双重人格？也未可知。
    从远望楼十层的窗口极目远眺，苍生如豆。他凝视着远方告诉我，他今年打算写一部１５万字左右的长篇报告文学，通过两个女红卫兵的遭遇，辐射透视历史，观照现实，从而，对这一代人的命运和选择作出自己的评价。
    我问：“你是否想通过贯串一种历史文化意识，走出社会问题报告文学由轰动带来的困境？”
    他答：“有这个意思。苏晓康说我们这个民族是个输不起的民族；我补充一句：我们这个民族是一个健忘的民族。”
    我若有所悟。文不如其人，其人胡平，一江西老俵也。
