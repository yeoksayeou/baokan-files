Title: Social Phenomena Arising from the Non-Assignment of University Graduates—Parents Increasingly Using Connections for Their Children

Generally speaking, university students have a strong sense of participation in politics and the fate of the country, and should be steadfast supporters and active participants in reform. However, when reforming the university graduate assignment system, which has many flaws, many "elite" students are worried. A statistical survey shows that although most university students support the reform of the assignment system, almost at the same time, they also believe that the timing is not yet ripe and that the reform measures should be implemented gradually.

Their concerns are not without reason. Can the current atmosphere allow the reform of the graduate assignment system to have the effect of promoting benefits and eliminating drawbacks?

Compared to many recruitment and employment processes, university admissions are relatively fair, as there is at least one inflexible but universally applicable cutoff score. Despite this, the phenomenon of "taking the lower score over the higher score" after passing the cutoff is not uncommon. This is difficult to prevent and even harder to investigate. However, when it comes to assignment, even this "cutoff" is gone, so is it reasonable, fair, and equal? Since even admission with a cutoff score cannot ensure equal opportunity, the situation for assignments is even more imaginable. Non-assignment and mutual selection are reasonable in theory. But in the current social climate, without a supervision mechanism, as long as both parties agree, no one can do anything about it, thus legalizing the "backdoor" in assignments. Since the assignment work is solved through backers and connections, the student's true abilities and learning become less important, and what matters is the parents' capabilities. No wonder some people say, "Going to university is testing the child, finding a job is testing the parents."

Even if the social climate improves, the low quality of some current leaders, who cannot use people according to their abilities, also makes it difficult for assignments to be fair and reasonable. Last year, at a university graduate assignment consultation meeting held in Beijing, some "elite" students were marked with an "X" by the employing units because they were "not particular about small matters." I remember an entrepreneur once said, "For female university graduates seeking jobs, I prefer them to wear skirts rather than jeans. A few who wore jeans, we did not accept them." A piece of clothing deciding a person's fate, this is probably something those young women full of hope did not expect.

Reforming the assignment system is originally intended to provide university students with equal opportunities for competition, but if the current situation does not change, it will be difficult to avoid new inequalities. Those with "backdoors" and backers do not need to work hard; those without them will have to use all their efforts to find connections and backers. It seems that this reform, when it is implemented, still needs more detailed supporting regulations to curb those who take advantage of loopholes.

### 大学生毕业不包分配引出的社会现象——父母为子女走后门明显增多

　　大学生毕业不包分配引出的社会现象——        
    父母为子女走后门明显增多
   潘璠
    一般说来，大学生对政治、对祖国的命运前途有比较强烈的参与意识，理应是改革坚定的支持者和积极的参加者。但是，当对带有不少弊端的大学生毕业分配制度进行改革时，不少“骄子”却忧心忡忡。一份统计调查表明，尽管多数大学生赞成改革分配制度，但几乎同时又认为改革的时机尚不成熟，改革措施应该缓行。
    他们的忧虑，不无道理。时下的大气候，能使毕业分配制度的改革起到兴利除弊的作用吗？
    同许多招生招工相比，大学招生算是最公正的了，因为毕竟有一条不一定合理但对任何人都发生作用的死分数线卡着。尽管如此，过线之后舍高取低的现象并不罕见。对此，既难以防范，又不易追究。然而，到了分配的时候，连这样一条“死线”也没了，合理、公正、平等乎？既然入学有死分数线尚且不能机会均等，分配的情况自然可想而知了。不包分配，双向选择，道理上是很好的。但眼下社会风气不好，又没有监督机制，只要两厢情愿，谁也无可奈何，因此使分配“走后门”合法化。既然分配工作是靠后台、关系解决的，学生真才实学也就不那么重要，重要的是看学生父母的本事如何。难怪有人说，上大学是考孩子，找工作是考家长。
    退一步说，即使社会风气好了，目前一些领导者素质不高，不能量才用人，也使分配工作难以公平合理。去年，在北京市召开的一个大学生毕业分配咨询会上，有些“骄子”就是因为“不拘小节”，而使用人单位“感到不快”，并在其名下打了“×”。记得一位企业家曾表示：“对求职的女大学生，我喜欢她们穿裙子，而不是牛仔裤。有几个穿牛仔裤，我们都不要”。一件衣服决定了一个人的命运，这大概是那几位满怀期望的年轻女性始料不及的吧？
    改革分配制度，本来是要给大学生提供平等的竞争机会，但目前的这种情况不改变的话，却很难不导致新的不平等。有“后门”有靠山，更无需努力学习；没有的，则要使出浑身解数去拉关系找靠山了。看来，此项改革要出台，还须作出更周密的配套规定，以遏制那些钻空子的人的“对策”。
