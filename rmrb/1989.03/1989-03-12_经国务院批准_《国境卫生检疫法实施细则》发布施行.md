The implementation rules for the "Frontier Health Quarantine Law of the People's Republic of China" have been approved by the State Council and will be implemented soon.

This set of rules is formulated based on the provisions of the "Frontier Health Quarantine Law of the People's Republic of China," drawing on China's extensive experience in frontier health quarantine work over the years, and referencing the "International Health Regulations." It is an important administrative regulation related to foreign health matters. Frontier health quarantine is a component of preventive medicine and serves as the frontline defense against the spread of infectious diseases from abroad.

Implementing these rules, strengthening the health protection barrier at border ports, and enhancing frontier health quarantine work are crucial measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases across borders, protect public health, and ensure the smooth progress of opening up to the outside world.

　　经国务院批准
   《国境卫生检疫法实施细则》发布施行
    本报北京３月１１日讯  《中华人民共和国国境卫生检疫法实施细则》已经国务院批准，于近日发布施行。
    这个细则是根据《中华人民共和国国境卫生检疫法》的规定，在总结我国多年国境卫生检疫工作经验的基础上，并参照《国际卫生条例》制定出来的。它是一部重要的涉外卫生行政法规。国境卫生检疫是预防医学的一个组成部分，是防止传染病由国外传入的前哨阵地。
    贯彻这个细则，强化国境口岸卫生防护屏障，加强国境卫生检疫工作，已成为防止传染病由国境传入传出，保护人民健康，保障对外开放顺利进行的重要措施。　（徐致光）
