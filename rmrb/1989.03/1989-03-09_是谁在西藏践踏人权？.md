The State Council has ordered martial law in Lhasa. In recent years, separatist elements have repeatedly caused disturbances in Lhasa, making it an unstable city. In recent days, these disturbances have become increasingly rampant, posing a serious threat to the entire population of the city. Under these circumstances, the State Council has every reason to take decisive measures to protect the legitimate rights of the people of Tibet and maintain the unity of the motherland.

Some people abroad have criticized the measures taken by the Tibetan Autonomous Region government in recent years to stop the disturbances as "violations of human rights." These gentlemen have completely turned the facts upside down. No one is more concerned about the human rights issue in Tibet than the Chinese government. Before democratic reforms, Tibet was ruled by the most reactionary, darkest, and most brutal feudal serfdom in the modern world. At that time, the three great lords (nobles, monasteries, and the Tibetan local government) had the power of life and death over the serfs, and the people of Tibet did not even have the most basic personal freedom. It was the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government that led the million serfs to overthrow this evil system. It is laughable that those who now loudly advocate human rights abroad are some who once trampled on the human rights of the Tibetan people with brutal methods and later launched a rebellion to maintain their own privileges. It is unreasonable for some people abroad to stand with those who once brutally trampled on human rights and call on the Chinese government to advocate human rights. To take recent events in Lhasa as an example, groups of masked rioters have been looting and burning shops, smashing and burning vehicles, and brutally assaulting pedestrians and shop employees, turning the sunny Lhasa into a place where thugs can run amok. If such behavior by rioters is called human rights and is to be protected, then what about the law, and what about social stability and order?

It is worth noting that in this incident, some rioters were armed and fired indiscriminately. According to information from relevant departments, separatist groups abroad have recently sent people into the country as tourists to plan disturbances, while others have smuggled weapons across the border. Concrete evidence shows that the disturbances in Lhasa on February 10 and March 5 were planned by separatist groups abroad. The separatist elements abroad, on the one hand, sent people to infiltrate Lhasa to plan and carry out disturbances, looting, burning, and trampling on human rights, and on the other hand, begged foreign countries to intervene in the "human rights issue" in Tibet, which is extremely hypocritical! In fact, the so-called "human rights issue" is just an excuse. Their real purpose is to separate Tibet from China's territory. Over the past few decades, some foreign forces and separatist elements have never given up their attempt to separate Tibet from China, which is no secret in the world. Therefore, today's struggle between the Chinese government and separatist elements is a struggle between maintaining China's unity and splitting China.

The people of all ethnic groups across the country care about their Tibetan brothers, about Tibet, and about Lhasa. We have warm feelings for the Tibetan people and express our sincere condolences to the cadres and masses of all ethnic groups who have suffered in the recent disturbances. We pay high tribute to the public security police, armed police, and the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet who have made contributions to stopping the disturbances. We believe that the disturbances recently caused by a few separatist elements in Lhasa are just a small episode in the progress of the Tibetan people. The Tibetan Autonomous Region will achieve greater success in socialist construction in the family of the motherland, together with the people of all ethnic groups.

　　是谁在西藏践踏人权？
    新华社评论员
    国务院已命令在拉萨市实行戒严。近几年，分裂主义分子多次在拉萨制造骚乱，使拉萨成了一个不安定的城市。最近几天骚乱活动越来越猖狂，对全市人民形成了严重威胁。在这种情况下，国务院完全有必要采取坚决的措施，保护西藏人民的正当权利，维护祖国的统一。
    国外有些人责备西藏自治区人民政府近几年为制止骚乱而采取的一些措施是“侵犯人权”。这些先生们把事情完全弄颠倒了。没有人比中国政府更关心西藏的人权问题了。民主改革以前，在西藏实行的是当代最反动、最黑暗、最残酷的封建农奴制度，那时三大领主（贵族、寺庙、西藏地方政府）对农奴有着生杀予夺之权，西藏人民连最起码的人身自由都没有。是中国共产党和中国政府领导百万农奴推翻了这个罪恶的制度。可笑的是，今天在境外高谈人权的，是一些正是当年以残醋手段践踏西藏人权，后来又为维护自己的特权而发动叛乱的人。国外有些人和当年残酷践踏人权者站在一起来向中国政府呼吁什么人权，这是毫无道理的。即以最近几天在拉萨发生的事件而言，一伙伙蒙着脸的骚乱分子肆意抢劫、烧毁商店，砸、烧车辆，残暴地殴打行人和商店职工，把阳光明媚的拉萨变成了暴徒们可以任意逞凶的地方。如果把骚乱分子的这种行为称作人权，还要加以保护，那还有什么法律，还有什么社会的安定 和秩序？
    值得严重注意的是，在这次事件中，一些骚乱分子持有武器并随意开枪。据有关部门提供的情况，在国外的分裂主义集团近期一面派人以旅游者的身份入境策划骚乱，一面派人携带武器偷越国境。确凿的证据表明，拉萨２月１０日和３月５日开始的骚乱，就是国外的分裂主义集团策划的。国外的分裂主义分子一方面派人潜入拉萨策划并制造骚乱，恣意打砸抢烧，践踏人权，同时又乞求外国人来干预什么西藏的“人权问题”，这是多么虚伪！其实，所谓“人权问题”只是一种借口。这些人的真实目的是把西藏从中国的版图中分裂出去。这几十年里，一些外国势力和分裂主义分子，一直没有放弃把西藏从中国分裂出去的企图，这在全世界都不是什么秘密。因此，今天中国政府同分裂主义分子的斗争，就是维护中国的统一还是分裂中国的斗争。
    全国各族人民关心着兄弟的西藏人民，关心着西藏，关心着拉萨。我们对西藏人民怀着热烈的感情，对在最近几天骚乱中受害的各族干部群众表示亲切的慰问，对为制止骚乱立下功劳的公安干警、武装警察部队和人民解放军驻藏部队表示崇高的敬意。我们相信，少数分裂主义分子近期在拉萨制造的骚乱，只是西藏人民前进道路上发生的一个小小的插曲。西藏自治区将在祖国大家庭中，和各族人民一起在社会主义建设中取得更大的成就。
