	Seizing the Opportunity of Rectification to Adjust Economic Structure
	—An Interview with Sun Weiben, Head of the Heilongjiang Provincial Delegation
	By Wei Yanan, People's Daily Reporter

	“Premier Li Peng mentioned in the _Government Work Report_ that rectification and control must seriously adjust the economic structure. I think this statement hits the nail on the head regarding current work,” said Sun Weiben, head of the Heilongjiang Provincial Delegation, during a group meeting.

	He believes that rectification and control not only propose the task of optimizing the structure but also provide an opportunity for structural adjustment. The key to current rectification and control is to focus on adjusting the economic structure, concentrating efforts on developing agriculture, energy, transportation, and raw materials—these basic industries. Strengthen industries and products that can increase effective supply, while controlling the scale and speed of development of processing industries to ensure they are coordinated with basic industries.

	First, structural adjustment cannot rely solely on administrative measures. Economic, administrative, and legal means must be used in conjunction. Through administrative measures, investment is compressed, consumption is controlled, and credit is tightened, creating a situation where projects have ups and downs, products have surpluses and shortages, and enterprises have successes and failures. Then, through forms such as enterprise contracts, leasing, buying, merging, investing, and joint ventures, the adjustment and optimization of asset stocks are realized, allowing production factors to flow freely to enterprises or projects that need to be preserved.

	Second, the content of the adjustment includes not only industrial, product, and enterprise structures but also investment, credit, and consumption structures. Decisive lever adjustments must be implemented to achieve coordinated adjustments. Investment allocation, financial subsidies, credit direction, material allocation, as well as prices, tax rates, and interest rates—all economic levers must be tilted in a consistent direction and coordinated action according to industrial policies. For “bottleneck” industries, investment must be guaranteed, loans must be prioritized, and the financial sector should provide loan subsidies. Energy and material allocation must be ensured. In addition to provincial measures, it is suggested that the central government implement special policies for concentrated production areas of energy and raw materials. In cases where prices cannot be adjusted temporarily, either share the profits with local governments or appropriately reduce mandatory plans to facilitate the concentration of production factors in these sectors and regions.

	Third, adjustments must be combined with the province's actual situation, taking leading enterprises of famous, high-quality, and specialty products as the core, and focusing on strengthening leading enterprise groups and urban-rural integrated industries. Rearrange the development sequence of industries, products, and enterprises, and establish a structural adjustment responsibility system, implementing it to local governments, departments, and responsible individuals.

	Fourth, economic construction cannot be rushed, and adjustments cannot be rushed either.

　　利用整治机遇　调整经济结构        
    ——访黑龙江省代表团团长孙维本
    本报记者  魏亚南
    “李鹏总理在《政府工作报告》中提到治理整顿要认真调整经济结构，我觉得这句话说到了当前工作的点子上。”黑龙江省代表团团长孙维本在分组会上就此阐述了自己的见解。
    他认为，治理整顿既提出了优化结构的任务，也提供了结构调整的机遇。当前治理整顿的关键，就是要抓好经济结构的调整，集中力量发展农业、能源、交通和原材料等基础产业，加强能够增加有效供给的产业和产品，同时控制加工工业的发展规模和速度，使它们同基础产业相协调。
    第一，不能光靠行政的办法调整，要实行经济、行政、法律手段的并用。通过行政手段压缩投资、控制消费、收紧信贷，造成项目有上有下、产品有压有保、企业有死有活的态势，然后通过企业间的承包、租赁、买卖、联合、投资、参股、兼并等形式，实现资产存量的调整和优化配置，使生产要素有偿地流动到要保的企业或项目中去。
    第二，调整的内容不仅包括产业、产品和企业结构，还要对投资结构、信贷结构和消费结构，坚决实行杠杆倾斜，实现配套调整。投资分配、财政补贴、信贷投向、物资分配以及价格、税率、利率等经济杠杆都要按产业政策实行方向一致、动作协调的倾斜。对于“瓶颈”产业投资要确保，贷款要优先，财政还应为贷款贴息，能源和物资分配要保证。除了省里采取措施外，建议中央对能源、原材料集中产区实行特殊政策，在暂时不能调整价格的情况下，或给地方分点成，或适当调减指令性计划，以利于生产要素向这些部门和地区聚集。
    第三，调整要结合本省实际，以名优特产品、骨干企业为龙头，以壮大优势企业集团和城乡联动产业为中心，重新排列产业、产品和企业的发展顺序，并要建立结构调整责任制，落实到地方、部门和负责人。
    第四，经济建设不能急于求成，调整也不能急于求成。
