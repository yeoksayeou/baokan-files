    Establishing a Market Competition Mechanism
    Guo Shuqing

    The lack of a well-functioning market competition mechanism is a common cause of several major problems in China's current economic life. From the perspective of the economic system, the factors hindering the establishment and improvement of the market competition mechanism are as follows: First, the economic relationship between the central and local governments has not been properly coordinated. Local governments, either actively or passively, have taken on many economic coordination tasks, leading to issues such as regional blockades, barriers, redundant construction, and blind introductions. As long as the responsibilities and financial powers of local governments are not clearly defined and standardized, enterprises will face numerous difficulties in competing equally in the national market. Second, in several key aspects, the relationship between enterprises and employees (including managerial staff) has not yet seen fundamental breakthroughs. It is difficult for enterprises to truly implement a distribution system based on actual labor contributions. It is often hard to penalize employees who shirk work, steal, or disrupt production, and it is even more difficult to lay off redundant workers.

    From the perspective of the economic parameter system that directly regulates the behavior norms of production and operation entities, the traditional mechanisms that hinder and suppress equal competition are still playing a significant role in a considerable range.

    According to price theory, competitive products are best priced by market supply and demand. However, nearly half of the products still retain fixed prices. Some products have abandoned direct control in certain regions, but continue to be controlled in other regions; some products execute state-planned prices for one part and market-free prices for another. Even within the planned products, different enterprises may set various levels of actual prices. For monopolistic operational commodities, prices should not be arbitrarily set by producers, but due to the lack of a government supervision system based on market relations, price "dual-track" or "multi-track" systems have emerged.

    The current tax system also seriously hinders equal competition in the following ways: First, due to unreasonable interference from local governments, the turnover tax for the same product varies in different regions. Second, the income tax rates for state-owned, collective, joint-venture, and private enterprises are different. Third, within the same region and industry, the actual tax burden on enterprises is not equal. Fourth, product taxes and business taxes have various defects. Fifth, the quantity and scope of resource taxes are far from enabling the state to obtain the full rent income, making it difficult for enterprises to operate in the same environment.

    The price of funds or the cost of enterprises using funds still does not meet the requirements of factors such as term and risk to a considerable extent. The reasons are: (1) Rigid interest rates, long-term maintenance of negative interest rates; (2) Different banks pursue significantly different policy and commercial goals; (3) Government departments arbitrarily interfere with bank operations; (4) Enterprises in the same industry have very different external conditions when obtaining funds and foreign exchange.

    These situations indicate that establishing and improving the market competition mechanism is the core issue for the near-term reform strategy.

    The sequence for the formation of China's market competition mechanism should be to first establish the competition mechanism in the commodity market, and then establish the competition mechanism in the factor market. To this end, while implementing reform measures, corresponding policy measures must also be implemented to make them compatible and interconnected as a whole.

    First, with the establishment of a complete commodity market as the center, carry out coordinated reforms in prices, taxes, finance, planning, materials, and foreign trade and foreign exchange, so that enterprises gain complete autonomy in production and circulation.

    Second, with social security reform as the main starting step, gradually expand labor, wage, and welfare system reforms, open a restricted urban labor market, and give enterprises basic autonomy in hiring and internal distribution.

    Third, starting from separating the policy-oriented financial system and the operational financial system, carry out banking financial reforms. Reform the management mechanism of indirect finance and gradually open direct finance in a planned and step-by-step manner.

    Fourth, gradually carry out reforms to clarify enterprise property rights and land use rights, implement shareholding in state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises in stages, and auction or lease state-owned small enterprises. Implement bankruptcy and factor reorganization for enterprises that have been operating at a loss for a long time and are insolvent.

    Rationalizing prices is a difficult point in the reform. The success of price reform depends on whether other aspects of the reform can create mechanisms for structural adjustment and inflation control. However, reform measures alone are not enough to achieve the goal. Transitional policy measures are very important. We believe that in the initial stage of the reform, there should be at least the following aspects: (1) Fiscal and credit policies that meet market price requirements; (2) Investment policies to expand the supply capacity of bottleneck industries and short-supply products; (3) Clean up and rectify investment projects, implement permit management, and for enterprises with particularly severe resource waste, implement structural adjustment policies of shutdown, merger, and transformation; (4) Strict monetary policy to control the total money supply; (5) Use administrative and tax measures to control wage inflation.

### 建立市场竞争机制

　　建立市场竞争机制
    郭树清
    市场竞争机制不健全，是当前我国经济生活中存在的几个主要问题的共同原因。妨碍市场竞争机制建立和完善的因素，从经济体制的角度看，一是中央和地方的经济关系没有理顺，地方政府主动地或被动地承担了许多经济协调任务，由此产生了地区封锁、阻隔、重复建设和盲目引进问题。只要地方政府的事权财权不明确不规范，企业在全国市场上的平等竞争就会遇到重重困难。二是企业与职工（包括经理人员）的关系在几个关键方面至今尚未出现根本的突破。企业内部很难真正实行按实际劳动贡献计付报酬的分配制度。对于怠工偷懒甚至破坏生产秩序的职工常常难以惩处，解聘闲余劳动者更是难上加难。从直接调节生产经营主体行为规范的经济参数体系来看，阻碍和压抑平等竞争的传统机制尚在相当大的范围发挥着作用。
    按照价格理论，竞争性产品最适于由市场供求决定其价格，但是至今还有将近一半的产品仍然保留着固定价格。有些产品价格在一部分地区已放弃直接管制，但在另一些地区则继续保留着管制；有些产品一部分执行国家计划价格，另一部分执行市场自由价格。同样是计划内产品，不同企业却可能制定出各种水平的实际价格。而垄断性经营商品，本来不应由生产者任意定价，但因政府还没有建立起以市场关系为基础的监督体系，也出现了价格“双轨制”或“多轨制”。
    现行税收体制在以下几个方面也严重妨碍平等竞争。第一，由于地方政府的不合理干预，同种产品的流转税在不同地区出现了多种税率。第二，国营、集体、三资企业和私营企业的所得税率各不相同。第三，同一地区同一行业，企业的实际税负不尽相等。第四，产品税、营业税因其自身的缺陷造成种种偏差。第五，资源税的数量和范围远没有达到使国家获得全部地租收益，使企业处于同种经营环境的程度。
    资金价格或企业使用资金的成本，在相当大的程度上仍然不能符合期限、风险等决定因素的要求。原因是：（１）利率僵硬，长期维持负利率；（２）各银行同时追求差异甚大的政策目标和商业目标；（３）政府部门任意干预银行经营；（４）同一产业中的企业在获得资金、外汇时外部条件很不相同。
    这些情况说明：建立和健全市场竞争机制是近中期改革战略目标选择的核心问题。
    我国市场竞争机制形成的顺序应当是，先建立起商品市场的竞争机制，再建立起要素市场的竞争机制。为此，在推行改革措施的同时，还必须实施相应的政策措施，使其在总体上配套和衔接。
    首先，以建立完整的商品市场为中心，进行价格、税收、财政、计划、物资和外贸外汇等方面的配套改革，使企业在生产和流通方面获得完全的自主权。
    第二，以社会保障改革为主要起始步骤，相应逐步扩大劳动、工资和福利制度改革，开放有限制的城市劳动市场，使企业在用工和内部分配方面获得基本的自主权。
    第三，从分离政策性金融体系和经营性金融体系入手，进行银行金融改革。改造间接金融的经营管理机制，同时要有计划有步骤地逐渐开放直接金融。
    第四，逐步进行明确企业产权和土地使用权的改革，在国营大中企业中分步实行股份制，对国营小企业进行拍卖、租赁。长期经营亏损资不抵债的企业实施破产和要素重组。
    理顺价格是改革的一个难点。价格改革的成功取决于其他方面的改革能否创造出结构调整和抑制膨胀的机制。但只有改革措施还不足以达到目的，过渡性的政策措施非常重要，我们认为在改革初期至少有这样几个方面：（１）符合市场价格要求的财政信贷政策；（２）扩大瓶颈行业、短线产品供给能力的投资政策；（３）清理整顿投资项目，实施许可证管理，对资源浪费特别严重的企业采取关停并转的结构调整政策；（４）严格控制货币供应总量的货币政策；（５）用行政手段和税收手段控制工资膨胀的收入政策。
