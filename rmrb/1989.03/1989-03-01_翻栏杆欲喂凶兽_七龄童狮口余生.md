A seven-year-old boy in Shantou City, Guangdong Province, was severely injured by a lion after attempting to feed it. Miraculously, he survived.

The boy, Guan Yihui, was playing in the Shantou City Zhongshan Park Zoo with his grandmother on the afternoon of January 30. He climbed over the zoo's barrier to pull out some grass to feed the lion. The lion inside the enclosure grabbed him with its two powerful paws, pulling him towards the cage and clawing at his face, chest, back, and thighs. In this critical moment, five or six men present managed to pull the boy out from under the lion's paws. Guan Yihui was rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment and received over 400 stitches.
