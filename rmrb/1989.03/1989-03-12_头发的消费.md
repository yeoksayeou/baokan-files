When I was a child, I lived in the countryside of eastern Hubei. There was an elder cousin in the village who was a barber (now they are called hairdressers). He took care of the haircuts for five or six surrounding villages. Most of the customers had shaved heads, while a few young men had parted hair. A shaved head cost one yuan per year, and a parted hair cost one yuan and fifty jiao. The villagers rarely went far, and my cousin was very reliable, cutting hair every eight days and shaving every half month.

This was in the early 1950s, and it was rare for women to get their hair done.

I don't remember exactly when, but people began to realize that getting a haircut could enhance one's appearance. Thus, the hairdressing industry, which had not been very prosperous for decades, suddenly boomed. The prices for women's perms and men's haircuts also rose sharply. A few years ago, a perm cost two yuan and fifty jiao, and a haircut cost three jiao and fifty fen, which are now history. Now, a haircut costs more than one yuan, and a perm costs more than five yuan, which has gradually been accepted by the majority of consumers.

The desire for beauty is universal. It is understandable that people pay attention to their hair and increase their consumption moderately. However, spending tens or even hundreds of yuan on a haircut seems a bit excessive.

Perhaps I am not used to it. The other day, I consulted a hairdresser. She said: Now there are all kinds of styles. I have seen explosive styles, wire styles, and wheat styles in Beijing, each costing eighty or ninety yuan. Besides, perms are not just for women; many men also get them. I asked: Who spends hundreds of yuan on a perm? She smiled and said through her teeth: "Well, people like you who receive a formal state salary definitely can't afford to spend this much money!"

Such high-priced perms, of course, have stimulated some hair salons and hairdressers. Therefore, there are situations where they are extremely enthusiastic, hoping you will follow the latest trends and spend more money. But if you only want a simple haircut, their enthusiasm immediately cools down. I experienced this. The hairdresser said to me, "Why not try a new style?" I said no, just the old style. So, the entire process took only eight minutes. The shaving was truly just a quick job. Therefore, I think that although some people can afford to spend hundreds or even more yuan on a haircut, in today's China, this is still very rare. We should not forget the broad masses of the people. Shouldn't the consumption of haircuts be moderate?

### 头发的消费

　　头发的消费
    小可
    小时候，我在鄂东农村，村里有一个堂兄，是剃头的（现在都称理发）。周围五六个村子的头都由他包剃，多是光头，也有少数小伙子留分头的，剃光头一年交一元钱，理分头的交一点五元。村子里的人不出远门，堂兄也很讲信誉，八天一修（剃发迹、修面），半月一剃。
    那是在五十年代初，女性理发是不多见的。
    也不知是从什么时候起，人们开始意识到：理发，能为人增添风度。于是，几十年并不很兴旺的理发（几年前，城里理发难的呼声很高），一下子兴旺起来，妇女烫发、男性理发的价码也就直线上升。几年前二元五烫个头、三角五理个发，成为历史，一元以上理个发、五元以上烫个发渐渐被广大消费者所接受。
    爱美之心，人皆有之。人们注意头发美，适度增加一些消费，无可非议。然而有的理个发花大几十甚至一二百元，就有点那个了。
    也可能是我少见多怪。日前我请教一位理发师傅。她说：现在样式五花八门，我见到的，北京就有爆炸式、钢丝式、麦穗式，一个活收费得八九十元。再说，烫发也不只女的，男的也不少。我问：花上百元烫个发，多是些什么人？她笑了笑，从牙缝里挤出一句话来：“反正像你这样拿国家正式工资的，是绝对舍不得花这个钱的！”
    这样的高价烫发，当然刺激了一些理发店和理发师，所以不乏这样的情况：极度热情、希望你赶新潮，出高价，而你只要求理个普通的，那热度马上就冷下来。我就经历过，师傅对我说，来个新潮式的吧，我说不用，就老式样子。于是，一个全活仅只花了八分钟。那刮脸，真的就是两面三刀。所以，我想，固然有人出得起上百甚至更多的钱来理发，但在目前中国大地上毕竟是极其少的，不能忘了广大的人民群众，头发的消费难道不应该适度吗！
