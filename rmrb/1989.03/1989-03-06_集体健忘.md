The events of the Cultural Revolution are not things that should be forgotten, nor can they be forgotten. However, there are some things that genuinely cannot be recalled. For example, soon after the Cultural Revolution ended, a couplet circulated among the people. The upper line reads: “The power-holders send power-holders to hold power,” and the lower line reads: “The masses fight the masses to fight the masses.” I cannot remember the horizontal scroll. Only recently did I hear someone say that the horizontal scroll was “Cultural Revolution.” This “not remembering” is probably what is now known as a Western term: “collective unconscious.” According to one scholar's translation, it is called “collective forgetfulness.”

Searching through the “unconscious” consciousness, I recall the time of “criticizing Lin Biao and Confucius and the Duke of Zhou.” The scribes said that if we did not criticize Confucius's “learn and then seek officialdom” to the point of stench, how could the “stinking ninth category” change their worldview? A certain official gave a report and insisted that Confucius that fellow was in office for just a few days and killed a “Shaozheng Mao.” The audience snickered. Someone quietly told him: “It’s not Shaozheng Mao, it’s Shaozheng Mao.” He said: “It’s almost the same.”

“Learn and then seek officialdom” and “seek officialdom and then learn” are just two words swapped in position, right? It’s just that “learn and then seek officialdom” was not said by Confucius, but by Confucius's student Zixia. Moreover, before this sentence, there is an important preceding sentence: “seek officialdom and then learn.” The meaning of the word “excellence” originally is having surplus, meaning when one is in office and has surplus energy, one should read books and learn. Zixia's words are an elaboration on Confucius's thought of “when one has surplus energy, then study literature” (Analects, Learning). “Seek officialdom and then learn, learn and then seek officialdom” (Analects, Zizhang). According to the meaning in the Annotations to the Analects: “In ancient times, when a great official or scholar reached the age of seventy, they retired and taught in their hometown. A great official became a grand teacher, and a scholar became a minor teacher. This is seeking officialdom and then learning. Learning to great perfection and then seeking officialdom. This is learning and then seeking officialdom.” Clearly, what is emphasized here is first “seek officialdom and then learn.” This “learn” is to conduct education. When education is done well and talents are supplied to the state, it is “learn and then seek officialdom.” This is the first layer of meaning. A deeper meaning should be: when you are in office and have surplus energy, you should learn. Learning well can help you govern well. Among Confucius's students, Zixia was the one who strongly advocated that officials must learn. As recorded in the Han Poetry External Transmission: “Zixia said: ‘There has never been someone who could govern the country and protect the people without learning.’” Another student, Zilu, said: “There are common people, there are altars of the soil and grain, why must one read books?” (Analects, First Progress). Zixia's words were a direct response to this idea of seeking officialdom without learning and that one could seek officialdom without learning. In summary, these two sentences are demands placed on “officials,” first and foremost on those in office. I do not know when “seek officialdom and then learn” was quietly omitted, and no one knew about it. “Learn and then seek officialdom” became the crime of intellectuals, known to all. During the Cultural Revolution, all “learning” was simply seen as the “function of a horse’s tail,” a kind of “capitalist tail” that could be cut off without regret. However, now, there is a new saying in society: “It’s not that having ability means you can be an official, but once you are an official, you have ability.”

The decade-long catastrophe, history played a big trick on the Chinese people, tormenting several generations. Now, we can advocate for “seek officialdom and then learn,” because “being rich and white” is not normal. The urgent task is to improve the cultural level of the entire nation. We must learn, think, not only learn and practice it in due time, but also learn and think about it in due time, not forgetting the lessons of the Cultural Revolution, so that the Chinese people will become wiser. The learning of “officials” is now more important than ever. From ancient times, it has been “the superior influences the inferior,” and “transforming the people” can “form customs.” The learning of “scholars” is also more important than ever. For decades, “the Six Classics comment on me” and the need for class struggle, just like Zixia's two sentences being dismembered, Chinese culture is often a distorted and misheard culture, and this habit remains to this day. Saying “dragon” makes the streets full of “dragon and phoenix dancing,” this cannot be overlooked. Without thinking and learning, coupled with collective forgetfulness, it is not impossible to have another few hundred or thousand Wang Qiusui from “Hibiscus Town,” and it is even more frightening to have another few thousand Li Guoxiang.

　　集体健忘
    陈子谦
    “文革”中的事是不应该忘记，也忘不了的，但也有的事确实记不起来了。比如“文革”结束不久民间流行的一幅对联。上联是：“当权派派当权当权派当权”，下联是：“群众斗斗群众群众斗群众”，横联我记不起了。最近才听人说，横批是“文化大革命”。这“记不起”，大概就是时下流行的一西洋名词：“集体无意识”。按一位大学者的译法，则叫“集体健忘”。
    在“无意识”的意识中搜索，我记起“批林批孔批周公”的时候，刀笔吏们说，不把孔子的“学而优则仕”批倒批臭，“臭老九”们怎能改造世界观？某官员作报告，硬说孔老二那家伙当官没几天就杀了一个“少正卯”，听众嗤嗤发笑。有人悄悄告诉他：“不是少正卵，是少正卯。”他说：“差一点不多。”
    “学而优则仕”与“仕而优则学”，也不就是头尾二字换了个位置吗？只是“学而优则仕”并不是孔子说的，而是孔子学生子夏说的，并且这句话前面还有一句重要的话：“仕而优则学”。这“优”字的含义原是有余裕的意思，就是当官有余力则要读书学习。子夏的话是对孔子“行有余力，则以学文”（《论语·学而》）思想的发挥。“仕而优则学，学而优则仕”（《论语·子张》）两句的含义，按照《论语正义》的说法：“古者大夫士，年七十致事，设教於其乡，大夫为大师，士为少师，是仕而优则学也，学至大成乃仕，是学而优则仕也。”很明显，这里首先强调的是“仕而优则学”，这个“学”就是办教育，教育办好了，向国家输送了人才，就是“学而优则仕”，这是第一层意思。更深一层的意思应该是：你当官有余力就应该学，学好了就可以把官当好。在孔子的学生中，子夏是极力主张当官必须学习的人，如《韩诗外传》载：“子夏曰：‘不学而能安国保民者，未之有也。’”同是弟子，子路却说：“有民人焉，有社稷焉，何必读书？”（《论语·先进》）子夏的话正是针对这种仕不由学、仕可不学的主张说的。总之，这两句话都是对“仕”者提出的要求，首先是针对当官的说的。不知什么时候，“仕而优则学”被悄悄隐去，无人知晓。“学而优则仕”便成了知识分子的罪名，妇孺皆知。到了“文化大革命”，干脆将所有的“学”统统视作“马尾巴的功能”，成了知识私有之类的“资本主义尾巴”，割之而无足惜也。然而，现在，民间有一种新鲜说法：“不是有水平就能当官，而是一当官就有水平。”
    十年浩劫，历史对中国人搞了一个大的恶作剧，害苦了几代人。现在，我们可以提倡“仕而优则学”，因为“富而白”不正常。当务之急是提高全民族的文化素养。要学，要思，不仅学而时习之，还要学而时思之，不忘掉文革血的教训，中国人才会聪明起来。而“仕”者之学，现在比什么时候都重要。自古以来，都是“上以风化下”，“化民”可以“成俗”。而“学”者之学，也比任何时候都重要。几十年来的“六经注我”和阶级斗争之需，就像子夏的两句话被肢解一样，中国文化往往是被歪曲了的道听途说的文化，至今余习未除。说“龙”就满眼满街的“龙飞凤舞”，此不可不察也。不思不学，加上集体健忘，再出几百几千《芙蓉镇》里的王秋赦，不是不可能的，再出几千个李国香则尤为可怕。
