Reportage writers and literary critics discuss "problem reportage literature"
Maturity accompanied by crisis

People's Daily News: Reporter Gao Ning reports: In 1986, the problem reportage literature wave, starting with "Tangshan Earthquake," "Yin-Yang Great Rift," and "Chinese Little Emperor," swept across the Chinese literary scene and continues to this day, known as the "third wave" of reportage literature with epoch-making significance. Recently, the *Reportage Literature* magazine held a symposium, where a group of reportage writers and literary critics engaged in dialogue, jointly discussing the current state and development trends of "problem reportage literature."

Compared to similar symposiums held in previous years, critics' focus has shifted from the social utility of this type of reportage literature to its stylistic and aesthetic features.

Critics He Xilai, Miao Junjie, Lei Da, and Zhang Jiong disagreed with the notion that "reportage literature is non-literature." They believed that since the emergence of problem reportage literature, reportage literature has broken away from the novel model and become an independent literary genre. These works generally radiate the "light of reason" advocating anti-feudalism, anti-ignorance, and promoting science, democracy, and freedom. When reason is organically combined with literary images, it produces a sense of beauty, a solemn beauty, with high aesthetic value.

Some people believe that problem reportage literature has an independent character: focusing on the cultural underpinnings behind social issues, from micro to macro, from surface to essence, it relentlessly explores our national character and cultural psychology. This type of work combines historical, philosophical, social, and literary elements, reflecting the cultural whole, and it is not accurate to describe it merely as "literary" plus "journalistic."

In contrast to the critics' passionate speeches, the writers expressed more confusion and unease about reportage literature creation.

Su Xiaokang is still driven by a sense of social responsibility, persistently exploring the path of problem reportage literature. He believes that Chinese society has undergone significant changes. Superficially exposing social problems, playing a bit of humor and wit, and using a bit of subtle implication and historical criticism may not suit today's readers' tastes. The question is whether there is the courage to reflect the deeper things we have seen and recognized. We are facing a challenge to our conscience.

Other writers also expressed a strong desire to break through the existing creation model. Wang Zhaojun advocates writing more "self-talk" works, abandoning overly rational and thematic writing styles. Xiao Fuxing hopes that reportage literature writers will reach a new level, taking Rousseau as a model; do not be satisfied with spreading and interpreting new ideas and concepts. Zhao Yu is troubled by the academic trend of popularization and visualization from the academic community and the reportage literature creation heat from the novel community. He believes that the way out for reportage literature is to return to more authentic and richer life experiences.

These writers, who have been active in the literary scene in recent years, feel more or less a sense of fatigue and stagnation from overloading. Wang Zhaojun said that reportage literature bears too many social responsibilities; it has played a too tragic role; the burdens of theory, news, and literature have been placed on one small brother of reportage literature, which is too unfair. Jia Lusheng declared that he would combine completing his mission with self-entertainment.

The general fatigue of reportage literature writers, critics believe, is a sign of some creative crisis. They said that crises often accompany maturity, and only by overcoming crises can one move towards a freer realm of creation.

Participants noted that at this time, new reportage literature works such as Qian Gang's "Sea Burial," Dai Qing's "Zhou Anping," and Cong Weixi's "Towards Chaos" have once again created a sensation.

New creative practices await further attention from the theoretical community.

Participants also included Liu Mengxi, Chen Juntao, He Xingan, Chen Zufen, Meng Xiaoyun, Zhang Shengyou, and others.

### 报告文学作家评论家研讨“问题报告文学”  成熟伴随着危机

　　报告文学作家评论家研讨“问题报告文学”
    成熟伴随着危机
    本报讯  记者高宁报道：１９８６年，以《唐山大地震》、《阴阳大裂变》、《中国小皇帝》为发端的问题报告文学浪潮席卷中国文坛，并延续至今，被称为报告文学史上具有划时代意义的“第三浪潮”。最近，《报告文学》杂志社召开座谈会，一批报告文学作家和文学评论家进行对话，共同研讨“问题报告文学”的现状和发展趋势。
    同前几年召开的同类座谈会相比，评论家的关注点不再是这类报告文学的社会功利性，而是它们的文体和审美特征了。
    与会的评论家何西来、缪俊杰、雷达、张炯不同意“报告文学是非文学”的提法。他们认为，自问题报告文学始，报告文学已脱出小说模式，成为独立的文学样式。这类作品大都闪烁着反封建、反愚昧，提倡科学、民主、自由的“理性之光”。理性一旦与文学形象有机组合，就会产生美感，而且是庄严的美感，具有很高的审美价值。
    有人认为问题报告文学有着独立品格：把焦点对准社会诸问题背后的文化底蕴，从微观到宏观，从表象到本质，苦苦探索我们的民族性格、民族文化心理。这类作品集结了历史性、哲学性、社会性和文学性，反映的是文化整体，仅仅用“文学性”加“新闻性”来表述是不准确的。
    与评论家慷慨陈词相较，作家们更多地表现出了对报告文学创作的困惑和不安。
    苏晓康仍为社会责任感所驱动，执著地探索问题报告文学的出路。他认为，中国社会情况发生了很大变化，皮相地揭示社会问题，在作品中玩一点幽默、机智，来一点微言大义、春秋笔法，未必适合今天读者的口味了。问题是有没有勇气反映我们已看到、认识到的更深层的东西。我们面临的是对良心的挑战。
    其他几位作家表现出突破现有创作模式的强烈愿望。王兆军主张多写“自言自语”的作品，摒弃过分理性化、主题先行的写法。肖复兴希望报告文学作家再登上一个台阶，以卢梭式的大思想家、大作家为楷模；不要满足于传播和诠释新思想、新观念。赵瑜为创作上受到来自学术界的学术通俗化、形象化趋势以及来自小说界的报告文学创作热的夹击所困扰。他认为，报告文学的出路是回到更真实、更丰厚的生活体验中去。
    这些近年来驰骋文坛的作家，或多或少感到一种超负荷运转的疲惫和困顿。王兆军说，报告文学承担的社会义务太多了，它充当了过于悲壮的角色；理论、新闻、文学三个兄弟的担子担在了报告文学一个小兄弟身上太不公平。贾鲁生声称他要把完成使命和满足自娱结合起来。
    报告文学作家普遍的疲惫心态，评论家认为是某种创作危机的征兆。他们说，危机往往是成熟的伴生物，只有克服危机，才能走向更自由的创作天地。
    与会者注意到，这些时，钱钢的《海葬》，戴晴的《储安平》，从维熙的《走向混沌》等报告文学新作再次产生了轰动效应。
    新的创作实践期待着理论界进一步关注。
    参加座谈的还有刘梦溪、陈骏涛、贺兴安、陈祖芬、孟晓云、张胜友等。
