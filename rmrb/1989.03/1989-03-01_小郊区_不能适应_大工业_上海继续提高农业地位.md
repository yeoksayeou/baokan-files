Title: "Small Suburbs" Cannot Adapt to "Large Industry"

The idea that agriculture accounts for only 9% of Shanghai's total output and that Shanghai is a "large industrial, small suburban" area has now been basically rectified. The number of municipal leaders and heads of various departments, commissions, and offices attending the municipal rural work conference this year is unprecedented.

Shanghai's industry relies heavily on the suburbs. Currently, Shanghai's 4 million farmers are basically self-sufficient in grain, and 700,000 urban residents have 100% of their vegetables supplied by Shanghai, 60% of poultry and eggs, and 40% of pork. Citizens are generally satisfied with the "vegetable basket." After the development of township enterprises, their income supporting agriculture is 10 times higher than the municipal financial input to agriculture. This situation is the result of implementing the municipal party committee's guidance in 1985 that the suburban economy must adhere to the "one, two, three" principle. "One, two, three" means implementing urban-rural integration, standing on two footholds (farmers' grain self-sufficiency and urban subsidiary food self-sufficiency), and adhering to the coordinated development of agriculture, sideline production, and industry. Over the past four years, Shanghai's agriculture, sideline production, and industry have all seen growth, proving that this guidance is completely correct, as a leader from the Ministry of Agriculture said, Shanghai has concretized the idea of agriculture as the foundation.

This year, Shanghai once again emphasizes the importance of agriculture, requiring all sectors to give agriculture the green light. To boost the enthusiasm of suburban officials, Shanghai has implemented financial contracting and decentralization measures, including delegating the approval authority for departmental projects, simplifying approval procedures, and relaxing various policies, giving county magistrates more autonomy. Counties also delegate power to township governments. To motivate farmers, the city emphasizes policy stability, addressing farmers' concerns about changes and reduced income. Previously, there were rumors about restricting township enterprises, causing farmers to worry. Municipal leaders reaffirmed the policy of steady development of township industries after necessary adjustments and announced that various policies would remain basically unchanged, giving farmers a "peace of mind." After the year-end distribution last year, the city encouraged savings and injected a large number of scarce commodities into rural areas, with 60% of the issued currency being recovered within half a month. Farmers are satisfied. Suburban officials say: "As long as the upper and lower levels have unified thinking and urban-rural consensus, then Shanghai's agricultural harvest this year is guaranteed."

### “小郊区”不能适应“大工业”  上海继续提高农业地位

　　“小郊区”不能适应“大工业”
    上海继续提高农业地位
    本报讯  记者章世鸿报道：认为农业在上海总产值中只占９％，上海是“大工业、小郊区”的思想，现在基本得到扭转。出席市农村工作会议的市领导和各部、委、办负责人，从来不像今年这么多。
    上海上工业，郊区出了大力。现在上海４００万农民口粮基本自给，７００万城市居民蔬菜百分之百由上海自给，禽蛋６０％自给，猪肉４０％自给，市民对“菜篮子”比较满意。乡镇工业发展起来后，其收入支援农业的数额比市里财政给农业的投入高１０倍。出现这样的局面，是贯彻市委在１９８５年提出郊区经济必须坚持“一二三”的指导方针的结果。“一二三”即贯彻城乡一体化，站稳两个立足点（农民口粮立足自给，城市副食立足自给），坚持农副工三业协调发展。上海这四年来，农副工三业都上升，说明这个指导方针是完全正确的，正如农业部领导同志说的，上海把农业为基础的思想具体化了。
    今年上海再一次强调重视农业，要求各行各业为农业开绿灯。为了提高郊县干部的积极性，上海实行了财政承包、下放权力等措施，包括下放部门项目的审批权限，简化审批手续，放宽各项政策，使县长有了更多的自主权。各县也向乡政府放权。为了调动农民的积极性，市里强调稳定政策，解决农民怕变、怕减少收入的问题。前段时间，听说乡镇企业要限制，农民很担心。市领导人重申乡镇工业在作必要的调整后仍要稳步发展的方针，并宣布各项政策基本不动，给农民吃了“定心丸”。去年年终分配后，市里鼓励储蓄，同时向农村投放大量紧俏商品，所发货币有６０％在半个月内就回笼了。农民感到满意。郊县的干部说：“只要上下思想统一，城乡认识一致，那末，今年上海农业的丰收是有保证的。”
