On January 25, I visited Kuihou Township and saw that some fertile fields had been dug up by gold panners, leaving them uneven and pockmarked. Many plots had turned into ponds, the green manure had been destroyed, and the irrigation ditches were riddled with large and small holes. I learned that gold panning in this area is unregulated, with hundreds of people coming to pan for gold every day, destroying over 100 mu of farmland.

　　淘金毁良田应由谁管
    １月２５日，我在桂口乡看到，一些良田被淘金者挖得凸凹不平，不少田块变成了水塘，绿肥被毁光，连水渠也被到处挖得大孔小眼。据了解，这里毁田淘金无人管，每天前来淘金的上百人，已毁田１００多亩。
