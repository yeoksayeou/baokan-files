The Ministry of Labor has stipulated that every new worker must undergo vocational training. Our reporter, Li Erliang, learned from the National Vocational Training Conference held in Zhengzhou that the "1989-1995 Vocational Training Work Plan" drafted by the Ministry of Labor stipulates that the starting salary and employment benefits of new workers entering factories will be strictly assessed. Based on their proficiency in skills, they will be issued corresponding technical grade certificates and position qualification certificates before their positions are determined.

To achieve this goal, over the next seven years, the labor departments will focus on expanding the scope of training. By 1995, the number of technical schools will reach 4,600, with an annual enrollment of 800,000 students; the annual training capacity of local employment training centers will reach 12 million people.

This year, according to the demand of the labor market, the scope of targeted and paid training will be expanded. According to the requirements of market competition, technical and business training will be strengthened. The previous apprentice system, except for a few professions, will gradually be replaced by a training student system. During the training period, trainees will not accrue seniority or labor productivity. Upon completion of the training period and passing the assessment, they will be issued a qualification certificate, and enterprises and institutions will handle the recruitment procedures. For in-service workers, training will shift to a focus on position-based training. Workers who have already obtained position qualification certificates will also need to undergo various adaptive training programs according to the actual needs of enterprise economic and technological development.

　　先培训后就业　凭技术定岗位
    劳动部规定每个新工人都须经职业培训
    本报郑州３月８日电  记者李而亮从正在这里召开的全国培训工作会议上获悉：劳动部制定的《１９８９—１９９５年职业培训工作规划》规定，新工人进厂后的起点工资、使用待遇，将经过严格考核，视其技术掌握程度，发给相应的技术等级证书和岗位合格证书后再确定。
    为达到这一目标，在今后的７年时间里，劳动部门将致力扩大受培训面。到１９９５年，技术学校将达到４６００所，年招生数达到８０万人；各地就业训练中心的年自训能力达到１２０万人次。
    今年，将根据劳务市场的需求，扩大定向培训和有偿培训，根据商品市场竞争的要求加强技术业务上的培训。过去的学徒工制，除了少数专业外，逐步变为招培训生制。培训生在学习期间，不计算工龄，不计算劳动生产率。培训期满，考核合格后发给合格证，并由企事业单位办理录用手续。在职工人的在职培训，要转移到以岗位培训为主的轨道上来。已获得岗位合格证书的工人，也要根据企业经济与技术发展的实际需要，不断进行各种适应性培训。
