In a diverse arts landscape, what represents the mainstream of national cultural development? What should the Party and the state's cultural authorities support, allow, and restrict in various cultural endeavors? This was the topic most frequently discussed by the three arts circles of the CPPCC.

During the country's transition from a planned economy to a market economy, there are bound to be growing pains, and culture may decline as a result. However, the state can support cultural and artistic endeavors that represent the nation's cultural level through policy, thereby avoiding a cultural downturn. This is the sentiment of many committee members. New Fung Ying-za (Xin Fengxia) said, "Our country has many excellent traditional plays that need to be preserved and passed down. Currently, young actors earn little, and some do not want to practice or endure hardship. If this continues, some works may be lost. Zhang Ruifang suggested that the state should support works rather than troupes. Whoever has good works should be supported, and large arts troupes with empty frameworks should be eliminated. Those with poor performance and who do not work should be weeded out, and money should be spent where it is needed."

Xie Jin believed that there are many low-quality music and dance performances currently, and they should be allowed to exist. Banning them is not feasible because our country has many illiterates and people with low cultural levels who enjoy these performances. To change this situation, there are two methods: one is to replace low-quality works with high-quality, universally appealing works, and the other is to gradually improve the nation's artistic appreciation level.

The representatives expressed dissatisfaction with the prevalence of vulgar cross-talk and obscene publications, hoping for policy restrictions. Ding Cong said that the state should take real action against these negative social phenomena and not just make empty statements.

Luo Yusheng believed that policy is the key to artistic prosperity, and the arts community should also think more. Xie Jin suggested using foreign exchange earned from some films to subsidize children's films that incur losses. Fang Jufen thought that corporate sponsorship of cultural endeavors is a viable path.

　　在多元格局中把握主流        
    ——政协文艺界代表议文艺政策
    本报记者  袁晞
    在多元的文艺格局中什么是代表民族文化发展的主流，党和国家的文化主管部门在各项文化事业中须扶持什么，应允许什么，要限制什么？
    这大概是政协３个文艺界小组委员们议论最多的话题。
    国家从计划经济到商品经济的大转变中难免有阵痛，文化因之可能滑坡，但国家可以从政策上扶持代表民族文化水平的文化艺术事业，尽可能地避免文化退潮。这是许多委员的心声。新凤霞委员说，我们国家有很多优秀的传统剧目要保存，要继承，现在年轻演员收入少，有些人因此不想练功、不愿吃苦，长此以往，有的作品就要失传了。张瑞芳委员建议国家应养作品，不养团，谁有好作品，国家就扶持谁，不要养空架子的大文艺团体，要淘汰水平差的、不干活儿的人，把钱花在刀刃上。王昆委员认为，要有合理的合同制，既让演员多发挥专长，也要保证团里的演出，否则出不了大作品、好作品。
    谢晋委员认为，现在有不少低层次的音乐舞蹈，应允许存在，禁止是不行的，因为我们国家有那么多文盲，有很多文化水平低的人，他们要看这些。要改变这种状况，只有两个办法，一是用雅俗共赏的好作品取代低层次的，二是逐步提高民族的文艺欣赏水平。
    对庸俗相声、下流书刊的流行，代表们都表示不满，希望有政策限制。丁聪委员说，对社会上的这些不良现象，国家要做几件真事情，不能空喊。
    骆玉笙委员认为，文艺繁荣，政策是主要方面，同时文艺界也要多动脑子。谢晋委员提出可以用一些影片赚回的外汇补贴赔钱的儿童影片；方掬芬委员觉得企业赞助文化事业是一条可行的路子。
