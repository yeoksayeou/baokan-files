In recent years, various regions have focused on adjusting the agricultural industry structure, emphasizing the planting area of small rice and cotton to ensure the stable increase in rice and cotton production. However, they have neglected the production of minor grains, leading to a shortage of minor grain supply and high prices.

For example, in 1988, the planting area of minor grains in my township was only 169 acres. Due to disasters, only 116 acres were harvested, with an average yield of less than 46 kilograms per acre. In fact, the township has many slopes, riverbanks, field edges, and corners that are suitable for growing minor grains. Farmers have also planted various minor grains in the past.

Minor grains are not only supplementary food for farmers but also indispensable raw materials for the food and feed industries. Especially with the development of animal husbandry, the demand for minor grains is even greater. It is suggested that while focusing on the production of rice and cotton, various regions should also seriously address the production of minor grains.

### 不能忽视小杂粮生产

　　不能忽视小杂粮生产
    近年来，各地在调整农业产业结构中，注重抓小稻、棉花的种植面积，以保证大米、棉花产量的稳定增长，但忽视了杂粮生产，造成了杂粮货源紧缺，价格昂贵的状况。
    例如，１９８８年我乡杂粮播种面积只有１６９亩，因遇灾害，只收获１１６亩，平均亩产不足４６公斤。其实，乡里有许多山坡、河滩、田头、地角都适合种杂粮，过去农民也种过各种杂粮。
    杂粮既是农民的辅助粮食，也是食品和饲料工业不可缺少的原料。尤其是大力发展养殖业，对杂粮的需求量更大。建议各地在抓紧水稻、棉花生产的同时，认真抓一抓杂粮生产。
