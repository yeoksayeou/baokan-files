Since 1981, Cheng Fangyuan has been an active figure on the pop music scene, a rare feat of maintaining such a long-term presence in the hearts of listeners. No wonder she confidently entered the ranks of the top ten stars last year.

Cheng Fangyuan was born in Beijing, with both parents working in the film industry. When she was a second violinist in the Central Symphony Orchestra, her favorite activities were learning English and singing. In 1981, she fulfilled her wish to join the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe as a solo singer.

In the early 1980s, the Chinese people, who were accustomed to "revolutionary" songs, were somewhat bewildered and confused by pop music. At that time, Cheng Fangyuan was still a young girl. With her enthusiasm and good artistic sense, she boldly ventured into this unexplored territory. She played the guitar and sang "The Ballad of a Wayfarer," "The Story of Love," and "Childhood," quickly winning the trust of her audience. Cheng Fangyuan's name soon spread throughout the country. In a few years, she performed in major events such as the "Beijing-Bonn Night" arts gala and the opening ceremony of the first China Arts Festival. She also successfully collaborated with the Bavarian Philharmonic Orchestra from the Federal Republic of Germany and the Wam Orchestra from the United Kingdom. She won multiple awards in national competitions such as the National Youth Singers Television Awards.

Cheng Fangyuan understands that "the key to success lies outside the realm of art": an actor's artistic success often depends on their personal qualities, which are the result of long-term accumulation. Therefore, she often reads novels, magazines, and studies psychology and philosophy, absorbing knowledge from various sources. As for languages, whenever she has spare time, she retreats to a corner, using a dictionary to read original works. Now she can vividly perform British and Spanish songs, which is related to this.

Cheng Fangyuan has traveled to more than ten countries with her troupe, and in each place, she tries to learn about the local culture during her performances.

When talking about the future, she says she has no specific plans, only wanting to "follow her feelings." By "feelings," she means understanding and sensing the emotions of the times, social cultural psychology, and the joys and sorrows of the people. Artists should be very sensitive and devout to these. If it's popular, then it should reach the people; if it's singing, then it should be done with all one's heart. For Cheng Fangyuan, is there anything more important than the art of singing?

### 在歌坛的风景线上——记１９８８年歌坛金星成方圆

　　在歌坛的风景线上
    ——记１９８８年歌坛金星成方圆
    林瑞华
    １９８１年以来，成方圆一直活跃在流行歌坛的风景线上，这样长时间地占据听众的心，是罕见的。难怪她去年终于从容地步入了十大金星的行列。
    成方圆生长在北京，父母都是电影圈子里的人。她在中央乐团当二胡演奏员时，最喜欢的事情是学英语和唱歌。１９８１年她如愿以偿进了东方歌舞团当独唱演员。
    ８０年代初期，听惯了“革命”歌曲的中国百姓对流行歌曲颇为惶遽乃至茫茫然。那时成方圆还是一个小姑娘，凭着她的热忱和良好的艺术感觉，毅然闯进这个还没有人涉足的领域。她操着吉它唱起《游子吟》、《爱情的故事》和《童年》，很快赢得听众的信任。成方圆的名字从此传遍大江南北。在几年时间内，她连连在“北京——波恩之夜”文艺晚会、首届中国艺术节开幕式等大型演出活动中亮相，还与来自联邦德国的巴普乐团、英国的瓦姆乐团有过成功的合作，并在全国青年歌手电视大奖赛等全国性的比赛中多次获奖。
    成方圆懂得“功夫在诗外”：一个演员在艺术上能否成功，多半取决于他（她）的个人素质，而这又是长期积累的结果。因此她常看小说、杂志，研读心理学、哲学等等，多方汲取知识。至于外语，一有空隙，她便躲到小旮旯，借助字典读原著。现在她能传神地演唱英国及西班牙歌曲，与此不无关系。
    成方圆曾随团出访过十几个国家，每到一地，她都在演出之余尽量学习当地文化。
    谈起未来，她说没有什么打算，只想“跟着感觉走”。所谓感觉，是指对于时代的情绪、社会文化心理和群众喜怒哀乐的认识和感受。艺术家对此是应该很敏感、很虔诚的。通俗，就通俗到群众那里去；唱，就用整个身心去唱。对于成方圆，难道有比歌唱艺术更重要的事情吗？
