Title: Affection for Crescent Lake

Crescent Lake is shaped like a crescent moon, nestled in the desert, not far from Dunhuang, beneath the Singing Sand Dunes.

Climbing the Singing Sand Dunes is quite an experience. Normally, walking on sand feels unstable. Climbing the dunes is even more challenging. Often, you climb three steps and slide back two. Before long, you're panting. How many times in life can one climb such a sand dune? Even if it's tiring, it's still enjoyable.

When I climbed, the sun was just about to set. The warm sand beneath my bare feet felt comfortable. The dune isn't very high, but because of the three steps forward, two steps back pattern, it feels three times higher. By the time I reached the top, I was quite thirsty. Nature's wonders always heighten one's desires, and then reveal Crescent Lake at your feet, shimmering gently.

The surrounding sand peaks are sharp, sculpted by the desert winds. The sun blazes, and the yellow sand covers the sky, but Crescent Lake, despite the scorching sun and the sand, remains gentle. It's like a young girl's eyes, casting a mesmerizing gaze that makes one's heart flutter.

I immediately rolled down from the top of the Singing Sand Dunes and rushed towards Crescent Lake.

"You're late," a local tourist said to me.

"Why?" I asked, puzzled, brushing off the sand from my clothes, and then feeling somewhat surprised.

"You should have come before the Cultural Revolution," she said. "Crescent Lake was truly beautiful then."

"Look," she said, tracing her hand along the shore, "over there, there used to be deep reeds; on the opposite shore, by the willows, there was a red-walled temple. It was so beautiful."

Yes, the reeds were dense like eyelashes, the willows swayed like eyebrows, and Crescent Lake's gentle gaze could make anyone lose themselves in a trance for three lifetimes.

"Unfortunately, it was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution," she said, sighing deeply. "They wanted to divert the spring water to the sand dunes to create a model farm. The temple was demolished, and the spring was blocked. The water flow was disrupted, and the water gradually dried up." She pointed to the receding waterline. "Now, they're digging for the spring."

Indeed, there was a dredging boat on the water, its arm raised like a scalpel. It was heartbreaking!

"Mom! There are fish in the water!" A joyful shout, splashing water, and an eight or nine-year-old boy rushed to her side. Behind him, a man with a stern face followed, his steps steady.

"This is our whole family," she introduced.

"Do you come here often?" I asked.

"We Dunhuang people often come here. It's rare to find clear water in the desert!" she said.

The sun had already set behind the sand dunes. The lake held onto the last rays of sunlight, giving it a touch of melancholic beauty. I rode away on a camel, leaving Crescent Lake. Even from afar, the boy's joyful voice echoed in my heart. Beauty is eternal. Even if it is destroyed, it will be rebuilt. I firmly believe that. Farewell for now, Crescent Lake!

　　情系月牙泉
    尹安贵
    月牙泉就像月牙，在沙漠中，在离敦煌不远的鸣沙山下。
    爬那鸣沙山，煞是有趣。平时在沙地上走，觉得步子很不得力。爬鸣沙山，就更用不上劲了。常常是爬三步，退两步。一会儿便喘吁吁的了。人生能爬几次这样的沙山呢？再累也高兴。
    我爬的时候，正是夕阳将下未下之际。光脚触着微温的沙子，很舒服。沙山不算高，但因为是爬三退二，就相当于增加了三倍的高度。到了山顶，就累得有些口干了。大自然神功造化，总是把人的欲望提上去，然后才让你一眼望见月牙泉，就在你的脚下，莹莹地闪烁。
    四周沙峰如刀裁，是漠风尖刻所致。太阳如火，黄沙蔽天，月牙泉任火烤沙埋，仍是一轮温柔。犹如少女的明眸，让人心中漫过销魂的眼波。
    我立即从鸣沙山上抱滚而下，扑向月牙泉。
    “你来迟了。”一位当地游客对我说。
    “为什么？”我不解，掸掸身上的沙子，进而有些吃惊。
    “你文革前来就好了。”她说，“那时的月牙泉真美。”
    “你看——”她用手沿着岸边轻轻指划过去，“这边上，从前都是深深的芦苇；对岸泉边的绿柳丛中，是一座红墙庙宇。可好看了。”
    是呵，芦苇萋萋如睫，岸柳摇摇如眉，月牙泉美目一盼，能不让人痴想三生？
    “可惜，文革中毁了。”她说，长长叹了一口气，“要引泉水上沙山，造大寨田。庙宇拆了，泉眼也堵塞了。破坏了水脉，水渐渐涸了。”她指指大步退缩的水位线，“现在正挖泉眼哩！”
    可不是，水面有一只挖泥船，扬起的臂，像手术刀。心痛呵！
    “妈妈！水里有鱼！”一声欢叫，一路水花飞溅，一个大约八九岁的男孩奔扑到她身边。后面跟上一个步伐沉稳的男子，面部线条刚毅。
    “这就是我们全家。”她向我介绍。
    “你们常到这儿来吗？”我问。
    “我们敦煌人都常来这儿。沙漠里有清泉，不容易呵！”
    夕阳已在沙山后。泉水恋恋留住一抹余晖，有几分凄婉的美。我骑着骆驼离开月牙泉。很远了，那孩子的欢声还萦回心头。美是永存的，即使不幸毁掉，定会重建，我坚信。后会有期，月牙泉！
