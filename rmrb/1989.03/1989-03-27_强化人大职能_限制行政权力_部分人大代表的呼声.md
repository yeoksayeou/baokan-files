Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 27th.

	"Government work report mentioned last year's investment and demand inflation, but behind this there is another inflation, that is, administrative power inflation." People's Congress representative from Hunan, China Democratic National Construction Association Central Committee member He Xiang told the reporter: "For example, last year the People's Congress resolution to stabilize prices was not executed, causing mistakes. To strengthen the legislative and supervisory powers granted by the constitution to the People's Congress is essentially to make the decision-making process for major issues democratic, scientific, and standardized."

	To implement the constitutional powers of the People's Congress, what urgent issues need to be addressed? "Clarifying legislative authority is one," He Xiang said: "Take the tax laws that have been promulgated in our country, for example. Currently, there are dozens or even hundreds of them, but only the Individual Income Tax Law and the Income Tax Law for Chinese-Foreign Joint Ventures are formulated and promulgated by the People's Congress. Some laws, due to improper legislative procedures and insufficient scientific verification, have strong ad hoc nature, lack authority, and have serious feasibility issues. I suggest that in the future, all tax laws should be formulated and promulgated by the People's Congress or its Standing Committee. Even partial tax laws should be approved by the People's Congress and its Standing Committee. This will help ensure the authority and scientific nature of the laws."

	In the Hunan delegation, Tan Jingyang and four other representatives proposed to transfer the Supervision Department and the Audit Office from the State Council series to the People's Congress series; He Xiang and 32 other representatives submitted a proposal: to expedite the formulation of the Supervision Law.

	Hunan representatives explained to the reporter that currently, the Supervision Department and the Audit Office, which are subordinate to the government, have many difficulties in supervising and auditing the government. When the problem involves government leaders, it is particularly difficult to handle. If they are included in the People's Congress series, supervision and audit will have a certain degree of independence, and their authority will also be enhanced. Formulating the Supervision Law can make the supervision work itself have laws to follow.

	Accompanying the inflation of administrative power is the inflation of corruption phenomena such as power-for-money exchanges. Many representatives expressed dissatisfaction with the People's Congress's supervision in this area. Shaanxi Provincial representative and Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress Li Xipu said: "Currently, the People's Congress's supervision of the administrative system is still at the stage of listening to reports, organizing inspections, thematic investigations, and accepting complaints, which are soft measures." He suggested that through the Supervision Law, the People's Congress's supervision should be turned into hard measures, and the People's Congress should have the real power to impeach and remove corrupt and disciplinary officials.

	Some representatives proposed that if the People's Congress is to assume its responsibilities, its own status needs to be reformed. "The People's Congress should not become a kind of compensatory institution and should not arrange too many retired comrades from the front line of party and government work to the People's Congress," said Shaanxi representative Xu Yongji: "Just like arranging party and government agencies, some relatively efficient people should be arranged for the standing institutions of the People's Congress, so that they have responsibilities and powers."

### 强化人大职能　限制行政权力——部分人大代表的呼声

　　强化人大职能　限制行政权力        
    ——部分人大代表的呼声
    本报记者  朱维群
    “政府工作报告讲到去年投资、需求双膨胀，其实这背后还有一个膨胀，即行政权力膨胀。”人大湖南代表、民建中央委员何祥对记者说：“比如去年人大决议稳定物价，但后来却未被执行，造成失误。要强化宪法赋予人大的立法、监督等权力，其实质就是使重大问题的决策程序民主化、科学化、规范化。”
    落实人大宪法权力，当务之急要抓哪些问题？“明确立法权限要算一条”，何祥说：“就拿我国已颁布的税法来说，目前已有几十上百种之多，其中只有个人所得税法和中外合资企业所得税法，是人大制定颁布的。有些法由于立法程序不严，科学论证不足，造成权宜性较强、权威性不够，可行性大成问题。我建议今后凡税法，全部由人大或人大常委会制定颁发，即使是局部性税法也应经人大及其常委会核准。这利于确保法律权威性和科学程度。”
    在湖南代表团，谭景阳等４位代表提议将监察部、审计署由国务院系列转入人大系列；何祥等３２位代表提出议案：尽快制定监察法。
    湖南代表对记者解释说，目前，由隶属政府的监察部、审计署来监察、审计政府，困难很多，当问题涉及政府领导干部时尤其难办。如果将其列入人大系列，监察、审计就有了一定独立性，权威性也将提高。制定监察法，可以使监察工作本身有法可依。
    与行政权力膨胀相伴随的是权钱交易等腐败现象的膨胀。不少代表对人大在这个领域内的监督作用不够深表不满。陕西省代表、省人大常委会主任李溪溥说：目前人大对行政系统的廉政监督还停留在听取汇报、组织视察、专题调查和接受举报等软办法。他建议，应通过监察法把人大的监察变成硬措施，人大应享有弹劾、罢免腐败违纪官员的实权。
    有些代表提出，如果人大要承担其应负的责任，其自身状态就需要改革。“人大不应当成为某种照顾性机构，不应过多地把从党政工作一线退下来的老同志安排到人大。”陕西代表徐永基说：“应当像安排党和政府机关一样，为人大常设机构安排一些比较精干的人，使其有责有权。”
