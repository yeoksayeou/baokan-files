Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 28th.

The State Council held its 37th executive meeting today, chaired by Premier Li Peng, which reviewed and approved in principle a decision on strengthening the management of non-ferrous metals.

The production of non-ferrous metals in China has developed rapidly in recent years, but it still cannot meet the growing demand. Currently, there is a significant supply-demand gap, and the market order is chaotic. The meeting believed that to further promote the production of non-ferrous metals, rectify the chaos in circulation, restrict unreasonable consumption, control exports, and ensure the needs of key national production and construction, it is necessary to strengthen the planned and market management of non-ferrous metals, especially copper, aluminum, and nickel.

The main contents discussed in the meeting on strengthening the management of non-ferrous metals include:

	•	Non-ferrous metal production enterprises must accept orders according to the quantity, variety, specifications, and quality stipulated by the state's mandatory plans and deliver goods strictly according to the contract.
	•	Strengthen the guidance and management of the self-sale part of non-ferrous metal products, including non-ferrous metal enterprises allocating a certain quantity of self-sale products to connect with key users, implementing directed and targeted supply.
	•	Continue to implement various effective policies for the development of non-ferrous metal production, such as encouraging social investment and local measures to expand non-ferrous metal production in areas with conditions.
	•	Clean up and rectify non-ferrous metal enterprises, clearly stipulating which units are allowed to operate non-ferrous metals.
	•	Gradually establish a well-organized non-ferrous metal market and strengthen the price management of non-ferrous metals.
	•	Strictly control the export of certain non-ferrous metals and mineral products.
	•	Restrict unreasonable domestic consumption and strengthen the recycling and regeneration of waste non-ferrous metals.

The meeting required all levels of material departments and non-ferrous metal operating enterprises to abide by laws and regulations, and to do a good job in serving production and construction. It also required all relevant departments of the State Council and local governments to strengthen the leadership of non-ferrous metal management work.

The State Council's decision will be published and implemented after revision.

Eleven members of the State Council's executive meeting attended today's meeting, with three absent due to official business.

　　国务院常务会议通过决定
    加强有色金属管理
    新华社北京二月二十八日电  国务院今天由李鹏总理主持举行第三十七次常务会议，审议并原则通过了关于加强有色金属管理的决定。
    我国的有色金属生产近几年虽然发展很快，但仍然满足不了需求的增长，目前供需矛盾突出，市场秩序混乱。会议认为，为了进一步促进有色金属生产，整治流通中的混乱现象，限制不合理的消费，控制出口，保证国家重点生产建设的需要，必须加强对有色金属特别是铜、铝、镍的计划管理和市场管理。
    会议讨论的加强有色金属管理的主要内容包括：
    ——有色金属生产企业必须按国家下达的指令性计划规定的数量、品种、规格、质量接受订货，严格按合同交货。
    ——加强对有色金属产品自销部分的指导和管理，其中包括有色金属企业要把自销产品划出一定数量，同重点用户衔接产需，实行定向定点供应。
    ——继续实行发展有色金属生产的各项行之有效的政策，例如在有条件的地方鼓励社会各方集资和鼓励地方采取措施扩大有色金属生产。
    ——清理整顿有色金属企业，明确规定哪些单位允许经营有色金属。
    ——逐步建立有领导有组织的有色金属市场，并加强对有色金属的价格管理。
    ——严格控制某些有色金属及矿产品的出口。
    ──限制国内不合理的消费，加强废旧有色金属的回收和再生利用工作。
    会议要求各级物资部门和有色金属经营企业遵纪守法，认真做好为生产建设服务的工作，同时要求国务院各主管部门和各地方，都切实加强对有色金属管理工作的领导。
    国务院的这一决定将在修改后公布施行。
    出席今天会议的国务院常务会议成员十一人，因公请假三人。
