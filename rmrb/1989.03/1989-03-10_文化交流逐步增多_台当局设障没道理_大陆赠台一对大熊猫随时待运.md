Cultural exchange between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is gradually increasing. The obstacles set by the Taiwan authorities are unreasonable. A pair of giant pandas from the mainland is ready to be sent to Taiwan at any time.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 9th, Ding Guanggen said today that efforts should be made to strengthen exchanges across the Taiwan Strait and promote cultural, educational, sports, scientific, and academic exchanges.

He said that exchanges in the fields of culture, education, sports, science, and academia between the two sides have already begun. He said that the scope of exchanges between the two sides is very broad. We plan to organize some cultural and sports projects that are popular with the people of Taiwan, such as Peking Opera, acrobatics, traditional music, fine arts, ancient books, cultural relics, traditional Chinese medicine, qigong, martial arts, etc., for exchange.

Ding Guanggen also mentioned the issue of sending giant pandas to Taiwan.

He said that in September last year, the relevant parties in Taiwan formally expressed their hope that we would send a pair of giant pandas to Taiwan for display at the Taipei Zoo. The China Wildlife Conservation Association has already prepared a pair of artificially bred young giant pandas for Taiwan, which are being fostered at the Beijing Zoo and are ready to be sent to Taipei at any time.

Ding Guanggen said that currently, exchanges between the two sides have shown significant development, but they are far from satisfactory. Over the past year, although the Taiwan authorities have relaxed their policies towards the mainland to some extent, many of their regulations are inhumane and unreasonable, and they artificially set up obstacles. We do not restrict Taiwanese compatriots from coming to the mainland, whether they are ordinary people or party, government, and military personnel. However, the Taiwan authorities do not allow Communist Party members to enter Taiwan; they only allow Taiwanese and their relatives to go to Taiwan to visit the sick and attend funerals, but not to visit relatives, and they also stipulate that children cannot be brought along. Communications are not allowed to be sent directly by mail, and sea passenger transport must be transferred through a "third country"; direct trade is not allowed, resulting in increased costs and loss of benefits. These regulations obviously go against public opinion.

　　文化交流逐步增多
    台当局设障没道理
    大陆赠台一对大熊猫随时待运
    据新华社北京３月９日电  丁关根今天说，要加强海峡两岸往来，促进文化教育、体育、科技、学术等领域的交流。
    他说，两岸文化、教育、体育、科技、学术等领域的交流，已初步开展。他说，两岸交流的领域很宽。我们拟组织一些受台湾人民欢迎的文化、体育项目，如京剧、杂技、民乐、美术、古籍、文物、中医、气功、武术等等，进行交流。
    丁关根还谈到向台湾赠送大熊猫的问题。
    他说，去年９月，台湾有关方面正式向我表示，希望我向台湾赠送一对大熊猫，供台北动物园展出。中国野生动物保护协会业已为台湾准备了一对人工繁殖的幼年大熊猫，寄养在北京动物园，随时待运台北。
    丁关根说，当前两岸交往确有明显发展，然而远非尽如人意。一年来，台湾当局在大陆政策上虽有松动，但不少规定不近人情，不合道理，人为设置障碍。我们对台湾同胞来大陆，不管是平民百姓，还是党政军人士，从不加以限制。但台湾当局不准共产党员入台；只准台胞台属去台探病奔丧，不许去台探亲，而且规定不准带子女。通信不让直接通邮，海上客运通航要经“第三地”接驳；通商不准直接贸易，结果费用增加，肥水外流。这些规定，显然有违民意。
