Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita today morning in the House of Councillors Budget Committee responded to opposition party members' questions by admitting that he also believes the previous war was an aggressive war launched by militarism.

Socialist Party member Yada Ribo in the Budget Committee asked, "Former Prime Minister Nakasone had acknowledged that the previous war was an aggressive war, and last year, Foreign Minister Uno clearly stated that (the war against China, etc.) was an aggressive war launched by Japanese militarism. What is Prime Minister Takeshita's opinion?" Takeshita first expressed regret for the recent insufficient explanations regarding the previous war that have drawn criticism from neighboring countries, and stated, "The foreign minister said (the previous war) was an aggressive war launched by militarism, and I also recognize it as such."

Takeshita's public acknowledgment in his response that the past war was an aggressive war is the first time. Local newspapers say that compared to what he said in the Diet debate last month, "It cannot be denied that Japan has had a history of aggression against neighboring countries," this time it is more explicit.

　　竹下在日本国会承认
    上次大战是侵略战争
    本报东京３月６日电  日本首相竹下登今天上午在参院预算委员会回答在野党议员的质询时承认，他也认为上次大战是军国主义发动的侵略战争。
    社会党议员矢田理部在预算委员会提问说，中曾根前首相在任时曾承认过上次大战是侵略战争，去年宇野外相曾明确说过（对华战争等）是日本军国主义发动的侵略战争，问竹下首相有何见解。竹下首先对不久前关于上次战争的说明不充分而招致近邻国家的批判再次表示遗憾，并表示“外相说过（上次大战）是军国主义发动的侵略，我也是那样认识。”
    竹下在答辩中公开承认过去的战争是侵略战争是第一次。此间报纸说，与上月２７日在国会答辩时说过的“不能否认日本过去对近邻国家有过侵略的事实”相比，这次较前明确。
