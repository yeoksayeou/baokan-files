He was 89 years old.

	Comrade Zhu Liangcai was born on September 27, 1900, in Waisha Village, Lushan County, Hunan Province. In 1925, he joined the revolution and actively participated in the Hunan peasant movement led by Comrade Mao Zedong, serving as a committee member of the village peasant association. In October 1927, he joined the Communist Party of China. In January of the following year, he participated in the Xiangnan Uprising led by Comrades Zhu De and Chen Yi, and was tasked with organizing the peasant uprising in Zixing County. He then joined the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army (later renamed the Red Army) and went to Jinggangshan. During the Land Revolution War, he served as the secretary of the Red Fourth Army headquarters, the party representative of a company, the secretary of the Yanheng District Committee in Yongxing County, Jiangxi, the political commissar of the Seventh Brigade of the Third Column, the political commissar of the Ninth Army, the political commissar of the Fifteenth Army, the political commissar of the Bosheng Division (the Fourteenth Division), the director of the Political Department of the Thirty-Fourth Army, the political commissar and director of the Political Department of the Military Commission General Health Department, the director of the Political Department of the Thirty-First Army, the commander and political commissar of the Red Army Training Regiment, the deputy director of the Political Department of the Thirty-First Army, and the director of the Organization Department of the Political Department of the Support Western Army. He participated in the famous Gutian Conference and the Long March of 25,000 Li. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he served as the secretary-general of the Eighth Route Army Office in Lanzhou, the political commissar and director of the Political Department of the Third Division of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, the deputy director and director of the Political Department of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, and concurrently served as the deputy secretary of the North China Bureau of the Communist Party. During the War of Liberation, he served as the deputy principal and deputy political commissar of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military and Political Cadres School, and the deputy political commissar and director of the Political Department of the Huabei Military and Political University. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, he served as the director of the Political Department of the Huabei Military Region and the political commissar of the Huabei Military and Political University, the deputy political commissar and director of the Political Department of the Huabei Military Region, and the political commissar of the Beijing Military Region. In 1955, he was awarded the rank of Senior General and the First Class August First Medal, the First Class Independence and Freedom Medal, and the First Class Liberation Medal. In 1988, he was awarded the First Class Red Star Medal of Honor. He was a member of the Central People's Government Supreme Court, a member of the CPC Huabei Bureau, a member of the Huabei Administrative Committee, a representative of the first National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a representative of the first to fifth National People's Congresses, a member of the Standing Committee of the second to fifth National People's Congresses, and a member of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China.

	Comrade Zhu Liangcai had a lofty communist ideal and a firm revolutionary belief. He was loyal to the cause of the Party, steadfastly implementing the Party's line, principles, and policies. No matter how harsh the conditions or how treacherous the environment, he bravely and tenaciously persisted in the struggle. In 1927, after the failure of the Great Revolution, Comrade Zhu Liangcai was arrested and imprisoned. Facing the vicious enemy, he was unyielding and dignified. After being rescued from prison, he joined the Communist Party of China and continued to organize secret peasant associations, skillfully fighting against the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the Long March, he clearly opposed Zhang Guotao's erroneous line, propagated the Central Committee's line, and advocated revolutionary unity. Although he was subjected to attacks, he endured humiliation and worked diligently for the Party. In 1937, after the failure of the Western Expeditionary Army, he sought the Party organization alone, enduring hardships and overcoming numerous difficulties. After 36 days of begging and disguising himself, he finally returned to the revolutionary ranks. During the ten years of turmoil, he expressed great indignation and firmly opposed the wrongdoings of Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four." After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, although he was old and in poor health, he still paid great attention to the major affairs of the Party and the country, studying diligently. He wholeheartedly supported the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, maintaining high consistency with the Central Committee in thought and politics. He often educated his children and staff to firmly implement the decisions of the Central Committee, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and the overall policy and general direction of reform and opening up. His exemplary actions demonstrated the noble revolutionary qualities of a communist.

	Comrade Zhu Liangcai was a seasoned warrior, brave in battle, decisive in command, and skilled in applying Mao Zedong's military thought to direct combat, completing combat missions excellently. When he served as a grassroots commander, he always led by example, charging into the fray. After becoming a mid-to-high-level cadre, he insisted on personally directing battles on the front lines. In August 1928, during the Huangyangjie Defense Battle on Jinggangshan, he led the First Company of the First Battalion of the Red Thirty-First Regiment in bravely and wisely repelling a mad assault by an enemy regiment, defending the main military base of the Red Fourth Army. He participated in the Central Revolutionary Base's counter-encirclement campaigns, making important contributions to consolidating and developing the revolutionary base. In the first counter-encirclement campaign, he led the Ninth Army to participate in the battle to annihilate the enemy's Zhang Huizhou Regiment, commanding decisively and achieving significant results, seizing over 2,000 guns, an enemy radio station, and a cannon, receiving praise from Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhu De. In the fourth counter-encirclement campaign, he led the Fifteenth Army to tenaciously resist the enemy at the front, creating favorable conditions for the complete annihilation of the enemy's Eleventh Division by the First and Third Army Corps. Due to his excellent command, he achieved numerous victories and was awarded the Second Class Red Star Medal at the Second All-Soviet Congress of the Central Revolutionary Base. At the beginning of the Long March, under extremely difficult conditions, he led the rear guard division to fight against an enemy several times their size, covering the strategic withdrawal of the Central Red Army. Comrade Zhu Liangcai was wounded many times but never left the front lines. Sometimes he directed battles while lying on a stretcher. He often worked tirelessly day and night, falling ill on the job many times, demonstrating the high self-sacrifice of a communist.

	Throughout his decades of revolutionary career, Comrade Zhu Liangcai long engaged in military political work, making significant contributions to the political and ideological construction of the troops. During the Land Revolution War, he resolutely implemented the Party's resolutions and the spirit of the Gutian Conference, focusing on building party branches at the company level, emphasizing the education of the troops with proletarian ideology, and setting an example for others. During the Long March, he organized political education and cultural learning for the troops during battle intervals, propagating the Party's policies and heroic model deeds, playing an important role in consolidating the troops and ensuring victory in combat. During his time at the General Health Department, he personally organized medical rescue work with an extremely responsible attitude, saving the lives of many comrades. During his time at the Eighth Route Army Office in Lanzhou, he conducted in-depth investigations, made extensive contacts, and, following the principles of reason, benefit, and moderation, cleverly and flexibly fought against the Kuomintang reactionaries, rescuing a large number of revolutionary comrades. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he assisted Comrade Nie Rongzhen in leading the political work of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, conducting in-depth political mobilization, and arming the troops and masses with the Party's anti-Japanese line and strategic principles. He actively advocated and organized the model party branch and kill-the-enemy-to-achieve-glory movements, paying attention to the core role of party branches and the vanguard model role of party members, and timely discovering and propagating advanced models such as the "Five Heroes of Langya Mountain," "People's Militia Hero Li Yong," and "Mother of the Troops Rong Guifang." This played an important role in consolidating the grassroots and enhancing the troops' combat effectiveness. He valued propaganda and cultural work, fully utilizing the power of art, organizing the establishment of the "Anti-Japanese Tri-Daily" (later renamed "Children of the Troops"), "Jin-Cha-Ji Illustrated," and the "Anti-Japanese Drama Society," using lively and vivid forms to conduct anti-Japanese propaganda and education, exposing the crimes of the Japanese puppet army, and firmly establishing the troops' and people's belief in the inevitability of victory in the war of resistance. He participated in leading the political work in various anti-sweeping campaigns, summarizing many valuable experiences. He actively carried out "two-faced government," "infiltrating the enemy," and "surrender" work, playing an important role in disintegrating the enemy and strengthening our army. He patiently educated captured personnel, enlightening them with great principles, making many of them turn from darkness to light. He valued improving military-civilian and military-civilian relations, educating the troops to develop production, economize, and strive to reduce the burden on the people of the base area, receiving enthusiastic praise from the broad masses of the people. He made important contributions to consolidating and developing the "model anti-Japanese base area" of Jin-Cha-Ji. During the War of Liberation, he first assisted Comrade Nie Rongzhen in establishing the Jin-Cha-Ji Military and Political Cadres School, and then assisted Comrade Ye Jianying in establishing the Huabei Military and Political University, directly participating in the leadership of the two schools, and cultivating a large number of cadres for the development and growth of the troops. After liberation, during his tenure as the director of the Political Department of the Huabei Military Region, he assisted Comrades Nie Rongzhen and Bo Yibo in leading the political work of the entire region, playing an important role. During his tenure as the director of the political work of the Beijing Military Region, he strove to carry forward the fine traditions of the army's political work, resolutely maintaining the Party's absolute leadership over the army, insisting on the division of responsibilities under the collective leadership of the Party committee, valuing the construction of Marxist basic theory and grassroots party branches and cadre teams, opposing dogmatism, advocating and insisting on learning revolutionary theory in combination with the actual situation of our army, and paying attention to summarizing and promoting new experiences, making outstanding contributions to accelerating the construction of the army's revolutionization, modernization, and regularization. He cared about social education and wrote reminiscence articles such as "Jude's Shoulder Pole" and "This Mountain, It Revolutionizes!" which shine with the revolutionary glory of our army and have become vivid teaching materials for revolutionary tradition education.

	Comrade Zhu Liangcai possessed the noble qualities and revolutionary spirit of a communist. In more than 60 years of revolutionary life, he endured hardships, persevered, and worked tirelessly. He was infinitely loyal to the Party and the people, understood the big picture, had a broad vision, could go up and down, was diligent and hardworking, and never cared about personal gains and losses. In 1958, he voluntarily requested to step down from his leadership position, giving way to younger and more energetic comrades, and was praised by the central and military commission leaders. He studied diligently, was good at thinking, took on heavy responsibilities, was meticulous, and had a strong sense of responsibility and mission for the revolutionary cause. He was upright, insisted on principles, and was good at criticizing and self-criticizing. He connected with the masses, united with comrades, was approachable, and had a democratic style. He cared for and nurtured cadres, knew how to use people, was fair and upright, and insisted on "five lakes and four seas." He was strict with himself, honest and upright, simple and frugal, humble and cautious, and always maintained the character of the working people. He had high standards for his family and children, caring for their political progress, never interfering with or arranging their work, and had a good family tradition.

	Comrade Zhu Liangcai dedicated his life to the liberation of the Chinese people and the construction of the people's army. His life was a revolutionary life, a fighting life, and a life of wholeheartedly serving the people. His passing is a great loss to our Party and our army. His noble qualities and brilliant achievements will forever be remembered by the people.

	Comrade Zhu Liangcai will live forever in our hearts!
