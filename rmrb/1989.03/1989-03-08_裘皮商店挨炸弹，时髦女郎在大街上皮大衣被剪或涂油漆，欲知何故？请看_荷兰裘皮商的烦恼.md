Fur shops have been bombed, and fashionable women have had their fur coats slashed or painted on the streets. To understand why, let's look at the troubles of Dutch furriers.

Fur production is an important source of foreign exchange for the Netherlands. The country produces approximately 1.7 million furs of white sable, blue fox, and other animals annually, with sales reaching 1.1 billion guilders (approximately $520 million). With a promising market outlook, over 300 households in the country have specialized in breeding foxes and sables.

However, in recent months, Dutch fur industry operators have encountered an unexpected crisis. The market situation has not changed, but animal rights activists have intensified their campaigns against women wearing fur coats. In the early 1980s, the animal rights movement's propaganda was limited to persuading women to change their fashion trends and not to satisfy personal desires through the killing of animals. Now, this movement has begun to take intimidation and terrorist actions against fur shops. Some fur coat shop windows have been shattered by stink bombs, and women wearing fur coats on the streets have had their coats slashed or painted. As a result, fashionable women now avoid wearing fur coats in public.

The Dutch government finds this issue difficult to handle. Restricting households from breeding foxes and sables would be equivalent to depriving them of the opportunity to earn higher profits. If the fur industry is forcibly banned, it will not only affect the country's foreign trade income but may also provoke household resistance.

In fact, the Netherlands is not a major fur-producing country. The fur production of Scandinavian countries, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Canada all far exceeds that of the Netherlands. For example, Denmark produces approximately 12.5 million furs annually, about seven times that of the Netherlands.

Now, the movement against using wild animal furs for human clothing has developed into an international one. Before Christmas, London saw four major department stores catch fire in one day, allegedly related to the animal rights movement because the stores had fur coat departments. In this context, some people estimate that the industry of artificially producing animal furs will become increasingly prosperous.

However, fur traders are confident that this traditional international trade will remain viable in the foreseeable future.

### 裘皮商店挨炸弹，时髦女郎在大街上皮大衣被剪或涂油漆，欲知何故？请看——荷兰裘皮商的烦恼

　　裘皮商店挨炸弹，时髦女郎在大街上皮大衣被剪或涂油漆，欲知何故？请看——
    荷兰裘皮商的烦恼
    陈封
    裘皮生产是荷兰赚取外汇的一个重要行业。这个国家每年生产白貂、蓝狐等兽皮约１７０万张，年销售金额曾达到１．１亿盾（相当５２００万美元）。由于市场前景光明，国内相继出现了３００个人工饲养貂和狐的专业农户。
    可是近几个月来，荷兰的裘皮业经营者遇到了未曾预料到的危机。并不是市场形势发生了变化，而是保护动物权利运动人士加强了反对妇女穿皮大衣的活动。８０年代初期，保护动物权利运动的宣传只限于劝告妇女们改变服装的时尚，不要以残杀动物的手段来满足个人的物欲。现在这个运动已开始对裘皮商店采取威吓和恐怖行动，有些皮大衣商店的橱窗已被散发臭气的炸弹击碎，穿皮大衣的妇女走在街上时，大衣竟被人剪破或被涂上油漆。于是爱时髦的妇女已视穿皮大衣出入公共场所为畏途。
    荷兰政府对这个问题感到棘手。因为限制农户进行人工饲养貂和狐，无异于剥夺他们获取较高利润的机会。如果强行禁止裘皮业发展，既影响国家的外贸收入，又可能激发农户的反抗。
    实际上，荷兰并不是裘皮生产大国。斯堪的纳维亚国家、美国、苏联和加拿大的裘皮产量都大大超过荷兰。例如丹麦每年就生产１２５０万张毛皮，约为荷兰的７倍。
    现在，反对以野生动物的毛皮供人类制作服装的运动已发展成为国际性的了。圣诞节前伦敦曾发生一天之内４家大百货商店相继失火的事件，据说也和保护动物权利运动有关，因为商店设有经售皮大衣部门。在这种情况下，有人估计人工制造兽皮的行业将会越来越兴旺。
    但是经营毛皮的商人坚信这个传统的国际贸易项目在可预见的将来仍大有可为。
