	Zhejiang Issues First Batch of Standardized Stocks

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Hangzhou on March 17, the 2 million yuan worth of stocks issued by Zhejiang Phoenix Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., which were publicly offered to individuals by Zhejiang Securities Company, were all snapped up within less than an hour of the market opening.

	According to Zhejiang Securities Company, to date, Zhejiang Province has issued over 40 types of securities, but this is the first time that standardized stocks have been issued. The "Phoenix stocks" differ from general securities in that, apart from being liquidated according to regulations in the event of enterprise bankruptcy, they cannot be redeemed and do not have a fixed dividend rate. The stock value, dividends, and bonuses all fluctuate with the performance of the enterprise, with no upper limit on gains and no guarantee on losses. Once shareholders hold the stocks, it means they have converted their consumption funds into enterprise capital, enjoying the permanent right to dividends and increased value of the stocks. The stocks can be traded and disposed of freely according to the law.

　　浙江发行首期标准化股票
    据新华社杭州３月１７日电  （记者许群）日前，由浙江省证券公司代理公开向个人发行的“浙江凤凰化工股份有限公司”的２００万元股票，在开市不到１小时便被抢购一空。
    据浙江省证券公司称，到目前浙江省共发行了４０多种有价证券，但规范化、标准化的股票还是首次发行。“凤凰股票”与一般的有价证券不同，除了在企业破产时按规定清理外，不得退股，亦不确定红利率，股值、股息和红利均随企业的经营好坏浮动，上不封顶，下不保底。股东一旦持股，就意味着将自己的消费资金变成了企业资本，享有永久性的按股分红、控股增值的权利。股票可以依法交易，自由处置。
