Title: Cherry Blossoms Bloom Before the Tax Season Ends

Every spring, the economic powerhouse of Japan faces a financial conundrum. While the Diet debates the annual budget, the period from February 16 to March 15 is Japan's tax season. The tax authorities urge the public to fulfill their tax obligations promptly, aiming to complete tax payments before the cherry blossoms bloom.

Taxation is crucial for the normal functioning of the national economy, permeating social life and various economic activities, affecting every household. Taxes account for 80% of Japan's fiscal revenue, with only 4% from non-tax sources, and the rest covered by issuing national bonds. Taxes in Japan play a role in adjusting resource allocation, redistributing income, and regulating economic development, maintaining overall social balance. Japan lists the obligation to pay taxes according to the law, the duty to work, and the duty to receive education as the three major obligations of its citizens.

Japan's tax administration is overseen by the Ministry of Finance's National Tax Agency. Nationwide, there are 12 national tax bureaus, over 500 tax offices, and 53,000 tax officials, all operating under a vertical leadership structure. To promote tax knowledge and provide services, the National Tax Agency has set up 150 consultation centers and automated inquiry phones across the country. Each year, it provides tax-related supplementary textbooks to primary and secondary schools and distributes tax information and resident bulletins to every household. Apart from the National Tax Agency, which collects national taxes, each local government (prefecture) has its own independent tax department for collecting local taxes, forming a vast and intricate tax system with a complex set of tax regulations.

To understand Japan's tax system, the reporter interviewed the National Tax Agency and one of its branch offices, a tax bureau. Mr. Shimo-yama, who is in charge of publicity at the National Tax Agency, explained that Japan has over 50 types of taxes, each with clear and specific standards. They are categorized into national and local taxes, general taxes, and special-purpose taxes like those for developing power sources. They are also divided into direct taxes, which are collected directly, and indirect taxes, which are collected indirectly. Direct taxes under national taxes include individual income tax, corporate tax, inheritance tax, and gift tax. Local taxes include prefectural resident tax, municipal resident tax, business tax, fixed asset tax, automobile tax, and urban development tax, among others. Taxes are also classified by payment methods into self-reporting and fixed-rate taxation. In front of this complex tax system, the law stipulates that all business entities must hire qualified tax accountants to handle their tax affairs, and others are not allowed to engage in tax accounting services.

Among national taxes, individual income tax accounts for more than half of the total, directly affecting taxpayers. Since the 1950s, the characteristics of income tax collection methods include: self-reporting system: based on the principle that individuals know themselves best, taxpayers are responsible for submitting their annual income and taxable amount to the tax bureau. Those who report honestly are rewarded with preferential treatment. Source deduction system: employees' monthly salaries, royalties, etc., have the tax portion deducted before receipt and remitted to the national treasury. Except for those with an annual income of 15 million yen or more, general employees do not need to go to the tax bureau for reporting. Progressive tax rate system: based on the principles of fairness and reasonable burden, different tax rates are applied according to different income levels. Originally divided into 12 levels, tax reform simplified it to 6 levels, and starting from the 1989 fiscal year, it was further simplified to 5 levels. Deduction system: when paying income tax, various necessary expenses, basic expenses, and family support expenses are deducted in advance, and the remaining amount is taxed according to the level standards. Special provisions are also made for people over 70 years old, the disabled, and students to increase the deduction amount.

Taking a Japanese worker with an annual income of 4 million yen and a family of four (spouse and two children) as an example, Mr. Shimo-yama explained that if a worker's annual income is 4 million yen, according to last year's standards, first deduct necessary expenses of 1.295 million yen, then deduct family support expenses of 1.82 million yen, leaving a taxable amount of 88.5 million yen. According to the tax rate for an annual income of 4 million yen, 9.2 million yen of income tax needs to be paid. However, if he lives in Tokyo, he must also pay the local tax of Tokyo residents. If he lives in a different prefecture, he must pay the prefectural resident tax and municipal resident tax, the amount of which is roughly the same as the income tax. If he owns a car or real estate, he must also pay car tax and property tax. If someone's income is 10 million yen, then according to the progressive tax rate, the tax payable is not 9.2 million yen but approximately 10 times that amount, over 100 million yen.

It is generally reported that 99% of taxpayers can complete their tax payments on time, with very few cases of late or unpaid taxes. The tax bureau manages the tax records of all taxpayers in the area, using computers for centralized management. For those who pay late or evade taxes, the "additional tax" system in the tax law can be applied, with different penalties for different situations, including late payment tax, interest tax, and a surcharge tax of up to 40%. Tax officials have the right to investigate suspicious individuals, and if necessary, with the approval of the prosecution department, they can conduct compulsory searches or report to the prosecution for prosecution. Once discovered, taxes can be retroactively collected for up to 7 years, leaving no room for escape. The tax bureau encourages reporting, and each year, it publishes a list of high taxpayers to facilitate mutual supervision.

Despite the strict tax system, various forms of tax evasion still emerge. The National Tax Agency has a group of sharp and capable auditors, probably because of this.

　　樱花开放前打上完税“句号”        
    ——日本纳税季节见闻
    本报记者  孙东民
    内容提要：日本有５０多种税收，它把依法纳税列为国民的三大义务之一。从上到下有一个严密的税收体系，９９％的纳税人都能按时完税。对迟缴者和偷税漏税者，要依法处治，罚款额要上追７年。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    每年春季来临，经济大国日本总要为财务问题伤一番脑筋。国会内就年度预算进行的唇枪舌战且不去说，２月１６日至３月１５日是日本的纳税月，税务当局向公众呼吁：尽快履行纳税义务，在如云似霞的樱花开放之前打上完税的“句号”。
    税收问题事关国家经济的正常运转，渗透到社会生活和各种经济活动，涉及千家万户。日本财政的８０％要靠税收，税外收入只占４％，其余靠发行国债维持。税收在日本起着调节资源和所得的再分配以及经济发展速度的作用，维系着社会的总体平衡。日本把依照法律纳税的义务、劳动的义务和受教育的义务并列为国民的三大义务。
    日本的税务行政部门是大藏省国税厅，全国下设１２个国税局（所）、５００多税务署、５．３万税务人员，采取全国垂直领导。为普及税务知识和提供服务，国税厅在全国设有１５０处咨询中心以及自动问询电话，每年都向中小学提供税务知识辅助课本、并向每个家庭提供税收情报和居民传阅单。除征收国税的国税厅外，各地方自治体（都道府县）也有独立的征收地方税的税务部门，构成一个庞大而严密的税收体系，有一套复杂的税收制度。
    为了解日本的税收制度，记者采访了国税厅和其派出机构的一家税务署。国税厅负责宣传工作的霜山先生介绍，日本有５０多种税，各有其明确具体的税收标准，按类别分有国税和地方税，普通税和例如为开发电源等而设的目的税，直接征收的直接税和间接征收的间接税。国税中的直接税包括个人所得税、企业等法人税、财产继承税和捐赠税；地方税包括县民税、村民税、事业税、固定资产税以及汽车税、城乡建设税等。按纳税形态又分为自我申报方式和定额课税方式。复杂的税收体系面前，法律规定各企业团体的税务要雇请有资格的税理士担任，其它人无权搞税理业务。
    国税之中，个人所得税占总额的一半以上，与纳税者直接有关。自５０年代以来，所得税纳税方式的几个特点是：自我申报制：本着自己最了解自己的原则，个人负责将一年的总收入和应交税额向税务署提交申报单，对如实填报者实行奖励，提供优惠。源泉征收制：职工的月工资、稿费等，在领取前已扣除税额部分上交国库，除年收入１５００万日元以上者，一般职工可不必前往税务署申报。累进税率制：本着公平、合理负担的原则，按收入不等分不同的税率等级，收入越多，税率越高，原分１２级，税改后简化到６级，８９年度起又简到５级。扣除制：交纳所得税时，事先扣除各种必要经费、基本经费、家属抚养等费用，所余部分参照等级标准征收，还特别规定对７０岁以上的老人、身残者，就学子女给以照顾，提高扣除部分标准。
    以日本职工年平均收入４００万、配偶加两个子女的４口标准家庭为例，霜山先生介绍说，某职工年收入４００万，按去年标准，先扣除必要经费１２９．５万，再扣除抚养家庭的所得费用１８２万，课税部分就是８８．５万，依照年收４００万一级的税率，须交所得税９．２万。而如果他住在东京，还须另交地方税中的都民税，如住在外县，须另交县民税和村民税，其数额大体与所得税差不多，如果他有汽车、房地产，还需再交汽车税和资产税；如果某人的收入是１０００万，那么他应交的税额依照累进税率，就不是９．２万而是约相当于１０倍的１００万以上。
    据介绍，一般来说，９９％的纳税人都能做到及时完税，迟交或漏交者为数极少。税务署掌管着该地区纳税者的全部税务档案，用计算机进行集中管理。对于迟交或偷漏税者，可依照税法中的“附带税”制度，按情节不同要加交迟交税、利息税以及税率达４０％的加算税，税务人员有权对可疑者进行稽查，必要时经检察部门批准可进行强制搜查或报检察机关起诉。一旦查出，上追７年，鸡飞蛋打，谁都顾忌。税务署鼓励举报，每年定期公布高纳税者名单，以利相互监督。
    尽管税务制度很严，不过“你有政策，我有对策”，各种形式逃税仍层出不穷。国税厅之所以有一批精明强干的稽查专家，其原因大概即在于此。
