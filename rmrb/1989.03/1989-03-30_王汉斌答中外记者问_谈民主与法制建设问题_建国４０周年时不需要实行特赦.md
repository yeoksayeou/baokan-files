Wang Hanbin Answers Questions from Chinese and Foreign Journalists
Discusses Issues of Democracy and Legal System Construction
No Need for Amnesty on the 40th Anniversary of the Founding of the Nation

National People's Congress Standing Committee Vice Chairman and Legal Work Committee Director Wang Hanbin this afternoon in the Great Hall of the People answered questions from Chinese and foreign journalists regarding the draft Administrative Litigation Law, the draft Rules of Procedure for the National People's Congress, and related issues of democracy and legal system construction. This was the fifth press conference held by NPC spokesperson Yao Guang.

When asked whether China would implement amnesty on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, Wang Hanbin said: In the past, we granted amnesty to war criminals who had reformed and turned over a new leaf, which was decided based on the historical situation at that time. Considering the current situation in our country, I believe there is no need for amnesty now, and there will be no need for amnesty on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

The purpose of drafting the Administrative Litigation Law is to safeguard the legal rights of citizens and to maintain and promote the lawful exercise of administrative powers by administrative organs.

In response to questions about the implementation of the Administrative Litigation Law, Wang Hanbin said, in my report on the draft Administrative Litigation Law at this session of the NPC, I mentioned that the purpose of drafting this law is to safeguard the legal rights of citizens and, at the same time, to maintain and promote the lawful exercise of administrative powers by administrative organs. The purpose of implementing this law is not to passively restrain but to actively promote government agencies to act in accordance with the law.

He pointed out that China has long lacked a tradition of democracy and the rule of law, so there is an issue of updating concepts, habits, and bearing capacity regarding "citizens suing officials." This needs to be gradually resolved. Currently, there are over 130 laws and administrative regulations that stipulate administrative cases that can be sued in the people's courts. For example, the Regulations on Public Security Administration Penalties stipulate that if a citizen is dissatisfied with an administrative penalty imposed by a public security organ, they can sue in court. This shows that there are conditions for drafting and implementing the Administrative Litigation Law. Considering that there is still much preparatory work to be done before the implementation of the Administrative Litigation Law, such as drafting supporting laws and regulations and conducting propaganda and education, this law, if passed, will come into effect on April 1, 1990, providing nearly a year of preparation time.

Supervision work needs to be further proceduralized and institutionalized.

In response to a journalist's question about some NPC deputies believing that the NPC and its Standing Committee are insufficient in supervising the government's work, Wang Hanbin said, in recent years, NPC deputies have criticized the NPC and its Standing Committee for insufficient legal and work supervision over the government, and these criticisms are correct. I personally accept this criticism. We are currently studying how to strengthen the NPC and its Standing Committee's supervision over the government. Vice Chairman Peng Chong's report on the work of the NPC Standing Committee also proposed some measures, such as requiring the State Council to report to the NPC Standing Committee on the implementation of plans and budgets every third quarter. This is a measure to strengthen supervision. We are also considering drafting laws in the area of supervision procedures. In short, this issue needs further study and resolution.

The construction of the legal system needs a development process.

When asked about the prominent issue in current legal system construction, which is the phenomenon of having laws but not enforcing them, what are the reasons, to what extent is it due to administrative interference and unhealthy tendencies, and what measures will be taken in the future to ensure that the law is enforced, Wang Hanbin replied, the construction of the legal system in our country needs a gradual development process. The current phenomenon of having laws but not enforcing them has historical reasons. Our country lacks a tradition of democracy and the rule of law, and establishing the concept of acting in accordance with the law requires a process. Some people are not accustomed to or adaptable to acting in accordance with the law. Some citizens also do not yet know how to use legal weapons to protect their legal rights. The NPC, as a power organ, also has areas where it is not doing enough in supervising the implementation of laws. These problems all need to be gradually resolved.

The court independently exercises its judicial power in accordance with the law.

When asked why the draft Administrative Litigation Law does not stipulate that the Communist Party will not interfere with the court's handling of administrative cases and whether the Communist Party will interfere with judicial independence, Wang Hanbin replied, the Constitution of our country clearly stipulates that the people's courts independently exercise their judicial power in accordance with the law and are not subject to interference from administrative organs, social organizations, or individuals. In our country, the Party leads the people in formulating the Constitution and laws, and the Party also leads the people in observing and implementing the Constitution and laws. However, the Party committee does not interfere with the trial of specific cases.

Drafting the Assembly and Parade Law is a need for implementing the Constitution.

When asked whether the NPC Standing Committee is hastening the drafting of the Assembly and Parade Law in response to the student movement and recent efforts by some to sign petitions for the release of Wei Jingsheng, Wang Hanbin replied, the Constitution of our country stipulates that citizens have the freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, parade, and demonstration. These provisions of the Constitution need to be implemented through specific laws. In recent years, we have been researching and drafting laws related to the protection of citizens' rights, such as the Assembly and Parade Law. Therefore, drafting these laws is not considered from a single event but is for the better implementation of the Constitution.

China is drafting the Trade Union Law.

When asked why the NPC did not discuss the Trade Union Law this time, Wang Hanbin replied: Our country is a socialist people's democratic dictatorship based on the alliance of workers and peasants led by the working class. Trade unions hold a very important position in our country. The Trade Union Law is currently being drafted and has not yet been submitted to the NPC for deliberation.

　　王汉斌答中外记者问        
    谈民主与法制建设问题        
    建国４０周年时不需要实行特赦
    新华社北京３月２９日电  （记者孙本尧、何平）全国人大常委会副委员长、法制工作委员会主任王汉斌今天下午在人民大会堂，就行政诉讼法草案、全国人大议事规则草案及有关民主与法制建设等问题，回答了中外记者的提问。
    这是全国人大新闻发言人姚广举行的第五次记者招待会。
    有记者问到中国在建国４０周年时会不会实行特赦时，王汉斌说：过去我们特赦过改恶从善的战争罪犯，那是根据当时的历史情况决定的。根据我国目前的情况，我认为现在不需要实行特赦，建国４０周年时也不需要实行特赦。
    　　　　制定行政诉讼法是为了保障公民的合法权益，维护和促进行政机关依法行使职权
    在回答记者关于行政诉讼法实施的问题时，王汉斌说，我在这次人大会议上作关于行政诉讼法草案说明时说过，制定行政诉讼法是为了保障公民的合法权益，同时也是为了维护和促进行政机关依法行使行政职权。实施这部法律的目的不是消极制约而是积极促进政府机关依法办事。
    他指出，我国长期以来缺乏民主与法制的传统，因此，“民可告官”有个观念更新的问题，有习惯问题，有承受能力的问题，需要逐步加以解决。现在，我们有１３０多个法律和行政法规规定了可以向人民法院起诉的行政案件。其中，治安管理处罚条例就规定，公民对公安机关的行政处罚不服的，可以向法院起诉。这说明，制定和实施行政诉讼法是有条件的。考虑到行政诉讼法实施以前还有许多准备工作要做，如制定配套的法律、法规，进行宣传教育等，所以这部法律如能通过，将自１９９０年４月１日起施行，有近一年的准备时间。
    　　　　监督工作要进一步程序化、制度化
    在回答记者提出的关于有些人大代表认为人大及其常委会在监督政府工作方面存在不足的问题时，王汉斌说，几年来人大代表对人大及其常委会对政府的法律监督和工作监督不够有很多批评意见，这些批评意见是对的，我个人接受这个批评。现在我们正在研究如何加强人大及其常委会对政府实施监督的问题。在彭冲副委员长作的人大常委会工作报告里也提出了一些措施，如每年第三季度，国务院要向人大常委会报告计划、预算的执行情况。这就是加强监督的一项措施。在监督程序方面我们也在考虑制定法律。总之，这个问题需要进一步研究解决。（⑴⑵）
    　　　　法制建设需要有个发展过程
    有记者问，当前法制建设中的一个突出问题是有法不依，原因是什么？多大程度上是由于行政干预和不正之风？今后准备采取什么措施保证有法必依？
    王汉斌回答说，我国的法制建设需要一个逐步发展的过程。现在存在的有法不依的现象，有历史的原因，我国缺乏民主与法制的传统，树立依法办事的观念就要有一个过程。有些人对依法办事不习惯、不适应。有的公民也还不会运用法律武器维护自己的合法权益。人大作为权力机关，在监督法律实施方面也有做得不够的地方。这些问题，都需要逐步解决。
    　　　　法院依法独立行使审判权
    当有记者问到行政诉讼法草案中没有规定共产党不干预法院审理行政案件，共产党会不会干预司法独立时，王汉斌回答说，我国宪法明确规定，人民法院依法独立行使审判权，不受行政机关、社会团体和个人的干涉。在我们的国家，党领导人民制定宪法和法律，党也领导人民遵守、执行宪法和法律。但党委不干预具体案件的审判。
    　　　　制定游行示威法是实施宪法的需要
    有记者问到人大常委会加紧制定游行示威法，是否同学潮和最近有些人为释放魏京生而搞签名等有关时，王汉斌回答说，我国宪法规定，公民有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威的自由。宪法这些规定需要通过具体的法律来实施。近几年，我们一直在研究起草游行示威法等有关保障公民权利的法律。因此，制定这些法律并不是从一时一事考虑，而是为了更好地实施宪法。
    　　　　中国正在起草工会法
    当有记者问到这次人代会为什么没有讨论工会法时，王汉斌回答说：我国是工人阶级领导的工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家。工会在我国具有很重要的地位。工会法正在起草过程中，还没有提到人大审议。
