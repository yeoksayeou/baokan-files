	Women's talents have continuously emerged in the reform era. Currently, there are approximately 8.7 million female cadres in the country, an increase of 94.6% compared to 1978.

	Many outstanding female cadres have taken on important leadership roles. Since 1978, the number of female cadres at the county (department) level and above has nearly tripled, reaching 70,000. Among these female cadres, some have become the principal leaders of central and state ministries and commissions, some have been elected as the principal leaders of provincial, municipal, and county party and government leadership teams, and some have been appointed as managers of various enterprises and companies through competitive bidding.

	The number of female professional and technical backbones has rapidly increased. Currently, there are nearly 7 million women among various professional and technical personnel in the country, accounting for more than one-third of the total number of professional and technical personnel. Among high and middle-level professional and technical personnel, there are 1.28 million women, an increase of 33.7 times compared to 10 years ago. Female professional and technical personnel are playing an increasingly important role in various sectors such as industry, science and technology, education, culture, and health, and have become an indispensable force in China's modernization drive.

	The reform has also brought challenges to women. Some experts believe that due to the influence of old customs that discriminate against women, coupled with the impact of the reform on some protective measures, the situation of women's participation in politics and decision-making is not satisfactory. Female cadres often hold "deputy" positions rather than "principal" ones. The issues of cultivating and promoting female cadres, and acknowledging and compensating women for the costs of childbearing in the optimization of labor combinations, are urgent problems that need to be addressed.

　　妇女人才在改革中脱颖而出
    我国女干部超过８７０万　
    本报讯  改革１０年，我国妇女人才不断脱颖而出。目前，全国女干部约有８７０多万人，比１９７８年增长了９４．６％。
    众多的优秀女干部担任了重要领导工作。１９７８年以来，我国相当县（处）级以上职务的女干部增长了近３倍，现已达７万人。这些女干部中，有的担任了中央、国家机关部、委主要负责人，有的被选为省、地、县党政领导班子的主要负责人，有的在竞争中中标应聘为各类企业、公司的厂长、经理。
    女专业技术骨干迅猛增加，目前，我国各类专业技术人员中，女性有近７００万，约占各类专业技术人员总数的１／３强。高中级专业技术人员中，女同志已达１２８万人，比１０年前增长了３３．７倍。女专业技术人员在工业、科研、文教、卫生等各条战线发挥着日益重要的作用，已成为我国现代化建设不可缺少的重要力量。
    改革也给妇女带来了挑战。有关人士认为，由于歧视妇女的旧习俗的影响，再加上改革对一些保护性措施的冲击，妇女的参政议政情况还不尽如人意，女干部姓“副”的多、姓“正”的少；培养提拔女干部、优化劳动组合中如何承认和补偿妇女为生育所付出的代价，也是一个亟待解决的问题。
