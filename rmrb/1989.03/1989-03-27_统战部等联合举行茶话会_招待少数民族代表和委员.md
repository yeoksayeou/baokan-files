The United Front Work Department, the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Ethnic Affairs Committee jointly held a tea party to receive ethnic minority representatives and members attending the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress and the Second Session of the Seventh Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

Li Peng, Wan Li, Li Xiannian, Qiao Shi, and Tian Jiyun, among other central leaders, gathered with ethnic minority representatives and members at the Great Hall of the People this evening to discuss the great cause of national unity and progress.

The tea party was hosted by the Central United Front Work Department, the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Ethnic Affairs Committee.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, Apu Awangjinmei, spoke at the meeting.

He said, the State Council's order to impose martial law in Lhasa has received the support of the people of all ethnic groups, including the people of Tibet, across the nation. The plot of a few separatist elements to split the motherland is doomed to fail. Any foreign forces, regardless of the pretext, supporting the separatist activities of "Tibet independence" are gross interference in China's internal affairs and are absolutely unacceptable.

Apu Awangjinmei also emphasized in his speech that the current ethnic regions should also resolutely implement the policy of rectification, reform, and deepening reform, but should not adopt a "one-size-fits-all" approach. They should adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, allowing ethnic autonomous regions to adopt special policies and flexible measures based on local conditions. According to the political, economic, and cultural characteristics of local ethnic groups, actively formulate autonomy regulations and separate regulations. Gradually establish and improve a new system that truly promotes the development of productive forces in ethnic minority regions, full of vitality, and ensure that the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy is fully implemented, so that the economic and cultural construction in ethnic regions can develop smoothly.

During the tea party, the Military Band of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Central Institute for Nationalities performed musical and dance performances.

The Director of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, Simayi Aimaiti, presided over the tea party this evening.

　　统战部等联合举行茶话会        
    招待少数民族代表和委员
    本报北京３月２６日讯  记者费伟伟报道：李鹏、万里、李先念、乔石、田纪云等中央领导今晚在人民大会堂与出席七届人大二次会议和政协七届二次会议的少数民族代表、委员欢聚一堂，共话民族团结进步大业。
    今晚的茶话会由中央统战部、全国人大民族委员会、国家民委、全国政协民族委员会联合举办。
    全国人大常委会副委员长、全国人大民族委员会主任委员阿沛·阿旺晋美在会上讲了话。
    他说，国务院关于在拉萨实行戒严的命令，得到了包括西藏人民在内的全国各族人民的拥护，少数分裂主义分子妄图分裂祖国的阴谋是决不能得逞的。任何外国势力不管用什么借口支持“西藏独立”的分裂活动，都是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是绝对不能允许的。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美在发言中还强调，当前民族地区同样应当坚决贯彻执行治理、整顿、深化改革的方针，但也不要“一刀切”，要坚持一切从实际出发的原则，允许民族自治地方根据当地情况采取特殊政策和灵活措施。依照当地民族的政治、经济、文化特点积极制定自治条例和单行条例。逐步建立健全真正能促进少数民族地区生产力发展、充满生机活力的新体制，使民族区域自治法得到全面贯彻实施，保证民族地区的经济文化建设顺利发展。
    茶话会上，中国人民解放军军乐团和中央民族学院等单位表演了音乐、歌舞节目。
    国家民委主任司马义·艾买提主持了今晚的茶话会。
