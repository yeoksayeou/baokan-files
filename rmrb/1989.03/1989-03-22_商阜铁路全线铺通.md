The Shangfu Railway, a key project during the country's Seventh Five-Year Plan, was fully paved on March 19 after more than 4,000 workers from the Third, Fourth, and Fourteenth Engineering Bureaus of the Ministry of Railways worked tirelessly for two years. The Shangfu Railway is the second north-south corridor in East China, starting from Shangqiu City in Henan Province in the north and ending in Fuyang City in Anhui Province in the south, with a total length of 167 kilometers.
