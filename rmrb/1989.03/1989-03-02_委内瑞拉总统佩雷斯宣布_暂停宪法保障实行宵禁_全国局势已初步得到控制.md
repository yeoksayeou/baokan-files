Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, February 28th

Today at around 4 PM, the Venezuelan authorities announced that President Perez had signed an order suspending certain constitutional guarantees for farmers, allowing the armed forces to take necessary actions to stop the further spread of violent incidents and stabilize the situation. The Minister of Defense subsequently announced a curfew for tonight and tomorrow night. The situation has been initially brought under control.

In a televised address to the nation, President Perez stated that the nationwide unrest that began yesterday has resulted in the deaths of dozens of people, hundreds of injuries, and the looting of over 300 shops, causing significant damage to national property. The suspension of constitutional guarantees is aimed at ensuring the safety of the people, maintaining national stability, and protecting national property from further damage, allowing the armed forces to implement the curfew and control the situation.

Perez reiterated the necessity of the economic adjustment measures he announced on February 16th. He said that Venezuela's available international reserves have been depleted, and the country can no longer use large oil revenues to subsidize imports to maintain artificially low prices for food and daily necessities. It can no longer provide gasoline and other petroleum products at prices below cost within the country. Therefore, economic adjustment is inevitable to lay a solid foundation for further economic development. President Perez believes that the government's new economic policies take into account the impact on the lives of the middle and lower classes and include a set of compensatory social policies.

The wave of looting shops and burning public buses is unprecedented in Venezuela's recent history. This incident is sudden and intense, and it erupted almost simultaneously across the country, catching the government off guard.

This morning, Caracas was effectively under martial law, with the military patrolling major streets and military police guarding the entrances of large commercial centers. Commercial activities have ceased, and public transportation is only operational via the metro. Many people are unable to go to work. After President Perez's televised address, a reporter walked around the streets and found that the usually bustling streets were nearly deserted, with very few pedestrians and vehicles, giving a very quiet impression.

    委内瑞拉总统佩雷斯宣布
    暂停宪法保障实行宵禁
    全国局势已初步得到控制
    本报加拉加斯2月28日电　记者朱满庭报道：今天下午四时许，委内瑞拉当局公布了佩雷斯总统签署的暂停宪法对某些农民权利保障的法令，以便武装部队采取必要的行动制止暴力事件的进一步蔓延，稳定局势。国防部长随后宣布今天和明天夜间实行宵禁。局势已初步得到控制。
    佩雷斯总统在向全国发表的电视讲话中说，从昨天开始发生的全国性骚乱，已使数十人丧生，二三百人受伤，300多家商店遭到抢劫，给国家财产造成重大损失、暂停宪法就是为了保障全国人民的生命安全，保持国家的平静和保护国家财产不再遭到损失，使武装部队能按规定实行宵禁，控制和稳定局势。
    佩雷斯在讲话中，重申了他在2月16日宣布的经济调整措施的必要性。他说，现在委内瑞拉可动用的国际储备已经枯竭，国家再也不能像过去那样用大笔石油收入补贴进口，以维持虚假的食品和日用消费品的低价格了，再也不能在国内用低于成本的价格提供汽油和其它石油产品了，因此经济调整势在必行，这样才能为经济的进一步发展打下坚实的基础。佩雷斯总统认为政府的新经济政策考虑到了对中下层群众生活的影响，包括了一套补偿性的社会政策。
    哄抢商店、烧毁公共汽车的风潮在委内瑞拉近些年的历史上还是首次发生。这次事件一是突发性，来势很猛，二是全国各地几乎同时爆发，政府方面似乎对此准备不足。
    今天上午，加拉加斯实际已进入戒严状态，军队在主要街道上巡逻，一些大型商业中心门前已有军警防卫。商业活动全部中止，市内公共交通只有地铁还在运行，许多人无法上班。佩雷斯总统电视讲话后，记者在大街上转了一圈，只见往日车水马龙的街面上行人和车辆寥寥无几，显得十分冷清。
