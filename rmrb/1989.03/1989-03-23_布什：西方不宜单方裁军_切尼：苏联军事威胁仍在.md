	Bush: The West Should Not Unilaterally Disarm
	Cheney: The Soviet Military Threat Persists

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 21st - U.S. President George Bush today, at the swearing-in ceremony for the new U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, said that the United States and its allies should not unilaterally disarm.

	Bush said he holds a positive attitude towards the changes occurring in the Soviet Union, but there are still many questions about the ultimate outcome of these changes. He said that only when these questions are answered can the United States continue to implement its flexible policy that combines strength and resolve.

	Bush emphasized that while the United States seizes the opportunity to improve relations with the Soviet Union, it must remain vigilant in every situation to safeguard the national interests of the United States. He said that it is inappropriate to relax U.S. defense construction and allow the United States and its allies to unilaterally disarm at this time.

	When discussing the future defense plans of the United States, Bush said that both strategic weapons and conventional armaments must be modernized, while also developing the Strategic Defense Initiative and other defense plans. He reiterated the idea of gradually increasing the defense budget year by year.

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 21st - The new U.S. Secretary of Defense, Richard Cheney, today pointed out at his swearing-in ceremony that collective security is the "only strategy" for the West, and Western countries should strengthen defense cooperation.

	He said that due to the more pragmatic leadership of the Soviet Union and the successful strategies of the United States and its allies, the policies of the Soviet Union have changed. However, the danger still exists, and the Soviet Union has not reduced its strategic weapons system targeting the United States.

	He stressed that unless the Soviet Union significantly reduces its military arsenal, the United States has no reason to significantly reduce its own military strength.

	Cheney also called on the U.S. defense industry to improve productivity, reduce costs, develop new technologies, and contribute to national security.

　　布什：西方不宜单方裁军        
    切尼：苏联军事威胁仍在
    新华社华盛顿３月２１日电  美国总统乔治·布什今天在新任美国国防部长切尼的就职仪式上说，美国及其盟国不应该单方面裁军。
    布什说，他对苏联发生的变革持积极态度，但对这种变革的最终结局仍存在很多疑问。他说，只有这些疑问得到解答，美国才能继续执行它的与实力和决心相结合的灵活政策。
    布什强调说，美国在抓住有利时机与苏联改善关系的同时，必须在每一事件中保持戒备，以便保障美国的国家利益。他说，现在放松美国的国防建设，让美国及其盟国单方面裁军是不合时宜的。
    在谈到美国未来的防务计划时，布什说，必须使战略武器和常规军备都实现现代化，同时发展战略防御计划和其它军备计划。他还重申了逐年稳步增加国防预算的构想。
    新华社华盛顿３月２１日电美国新任国防部长理查德·切尼今天在宣誓就职仪式上指出，集体安全是西方的“唯一战略”，西方各国应该加强防务合作。
    他说，由于苏联现领导更讲求实际，同时也由于美国及其盟国的成功战略，苏联的政策发生了变化。但危险仍然存在，苏联并没有削减以美国为目标的战略武器系统。
    他强调说，除非苏联大规模裁减军备，美国没有理由大规模削减自己的军事实力。
    切尼还呼吁美国国防工业部门提高生产力，降低成本，开发新技术，为国家安全作出贡献。
