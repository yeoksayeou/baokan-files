In recent years, some military facilities of the Yunnan border defense troops have been repeatedly damaged, especially communication facilities that are often stolen, causing the state heavy economic losses and seriously affecting the troops' combat readiness training. After learning of this situation, the leading comrades of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government instructed the public security organs to actively investigate and solve the cases, and to severely punish typical cases as soon as possible. Since last November, the Malipo County Public Security Bureau has conducted investigations and gathered evidence in more than 100 villages, solving 20 cases, identifying 18 suspects, arresting 3, and seizing more than 150 stolen military items. This has struck a blow against the criminal activities of damaging military facilities and ensured the safety of military facilities.

　　公安部门执法严明        
    军事设施确保安全
    近年来，云南边防部队一些军事设施屡遭破坏，特别是通讯设施经常被盗，给国家带来重大经济损失，严重影响部队的战备训练。云南省委、省政府领导同志了解到这一情况后，要求公安部门积极侦破，抓住典型案件从速从严从重惩处。麻栗坡县公安局于去年１１月以来，先后深入１００多个村寨调查取证，共破获案件２０起，查出作案人员１８人，已逮捕３人，收缴各种被盗军用物资１５０多件，打击了破坏军事设施的犯罪活动，确保了军事设施的安全。
