A headscarf of purple, blue, and black, a brown shirt with a red sash adorned with silver ornaments. He comes from the Jingpo Mountains.

"I want to talk about ethnic education and ethnic culture," said Yang Qingming, a reporter and director of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Radio Station in Yunnan, and a newly appointed member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He told the reporter that after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, cultural development in the Jingpo region has seen significant progress. The province has a radio station, the prefecture has a radio station, and both have Jingpo language broadcasts. The provincial and prefectural publishing houses also have Jingpo language books and publications. The prefecture has also started publishing the Jingpo language literary magazine "Wenpeng" and the "Unity News."

"But," he frowned, "there are too few people who understand Jingpo script. There is a gap between the old and the young." He used himself as an example: "At the radio station, I have to do editing, translation, and broadcasting. It's hard to find people, there's no other way." He sighed, "Before coming here, in Kunming, I discussed with colleagues who work on Jingpo script. The most urgent demand is the lack of Jingpo language talent. We hope the country will provide more support."

"This issue, I plan to raise it in the group discussion. Because there is only one Jingpo ethnic CPPCC member, me." When he got excited, he gestured with his hands. The tassels on his headscarf swayed, and the silver ornaments on his sash made a pleasant tinkling sound.

　　景颇山来的新委员
    本报记者  张何平
    裹一方紫、蓝、黑色相间的包头，驼色的上衣斜挎缀有银饰品的红色筒帕。他从景颇山来。
    “我想谈一谈民族教育和民族文化。”云南德宏傣族景颇族自治州广播电台主任记者、新增补的政协委员杨清明告诉记者，十一届三中全会后，文化事业在景颇有很大发展。省有电台，州有电台，都有景颇语广播。省、州出版社也都有景颇文书刊。州里还办起景颇文的文学杂志《文崩》和《团结报》。“但是”，他眉头一皱：“懂景颇文的人太少，青黄不接。”他以自己为例说：“我在电台，编辑、翻译、广播都得搞。找人困难，没办法。”他不胜感慨：“来前，在昆明我同搞景颇文的同行交谈，大家呼声最强烈的就是缺少景颇文人才，希望国家多扶持。”
    “这个问题我准备在小组发言。因为景颇族政协委员就我一个。”说到激动处，他打着手势。包头上的小穗穗不停地晃动，筒帕上的银饰品发出阵阵悦耳的打击声。
