The flowering period of arrow bamboo can be predicted, and giant pandas may avoid the "food shortage."

According to Xinhua News Agency in Chengdu on March 6, (reporters Feng Xianshou and intern Yao Zhihao) Assistant Researcher Lan Libo from the Chengdu Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, recently revealed to reporters that the flowering period of the main food source of giant pandas, bamboo, can be predicted. This will alleviate the serious threat to the survival of giant pandas.

According to Lan Libo, he and his two colleagues have just completed a study on the spectral characteristics of the main food source of giant pandas in the western Sichuan region. The results show that the spectrum and reflectance of the main food source bamboo are different during different growth periods, especially when it is about to flower, the spectral changes are significant. The spectral characteristics of the main food source bamboo can be used as a way to predict the flowering period, thereby providing sufficient scientific basis for the active relocation of giant panda habitats and the planned renewal and strengthening of bamboo forests.

It is understood that there are about 20 species of arrow bamboo, which is the main food of giant pandas. However, arrow bamboo blooms once every 50 to 60 years, and the blooming process lasts for two to three years.

　　箭竹开花期可测
    大熊猫有望躲过“粮荒”
    据新华社成都３月６日电  （记者冯先受、实习生姚志浩）中国科学院成都山地灾害与环境研究所助理研究员蓝立波日前向记者透露，大熊猫主食竹的开花期可以预测，这将减轻对大熊猫生存的严重威胁。
    据蓝立波介绍，他和他的两名同事刚完成的川西大熊猫主食竹野外光谱特性研究成果表明：不同生长期的主食竹的光谱和反射率是不同的，尤其是在将要开花时，光谱变化很大。主食竹的这种特性可以作为预测开花期的一条途径，从而为主动迁徙大熊猫生活地点，有计划地更新复壮竹林提供充分的科学依据。
    据了解，作为大熊猫主要食物的箭竹约有２０多种，但是箭竹每隔五六十年要开一次花，开花过程历时二至三年。
