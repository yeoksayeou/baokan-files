Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 8th.

A fresh development has occurred in Yunnan's road passenger transport: long-distance buses now come with beds. This is reportedly a "new innovation in road passenger transport history."

The long-distance bus with beds is a modified version of the Dongfeng-brand large bus produced in Yangzhou. The interior of the bus is divided into 5 sections, each with upper and lower beds, totaling 20 bed spaces. The beds are padded with foam and come with mattresses, blankets, and pillows. Along one side of the aisle, there are also 8 hard seats, and 5 thermos bottles are provided for passengers to drink water. It is reported that each bed bus is staffed with two drivers who take turns driving day and night to ensure safety. During nighttime journeys, passengers are also provided with a free midnight meal.

Currently, the Kunming Automobile Transportation General Station operates 6 bed buses on the route to and from Dali. In the near future, 15 more will be added, operating routes from Kunming to Wenshan, Xishuangbanna, Dehong, and other places.

　　云南客运新鲜事
    长途汽车设卧铺
    据新华社昆明３月８日电  （记者周晓频）云南省公路客运出现了一件新鲜事：长途客运有了卧铺客车。据称，“这是公路客运史上的新创举”。
    长途汽车卧铺客车是由扬州产的东风牌大型客车改装而成的，车厢内分５格，设上、下铺，共２０个铺位。铺位用海绵软垫包装而成，有垫单、被、枕等卧具，车内走道一侧还设有８个硬座席位，并备有５只供旅客饮水用的保温瓶。据介绍，每辆卧铺客车上派两名司机，昼夜兼程，轮流驾驶以确保安全。夜间行车途中还免费为旅客供应一顿夜餐。
    目前，昆明汽车运输总站在往返大理的客运线上经营６辆卧铺客车，将在近期内新增１５辆，投入从昆明往返文山、西双版纳、德宏等地的运营。
