Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, March 15th.

The battle between Afghan Mujahideen and the Kabul government forces on the outskirts of Jalalabad has entered its tenth day.

Jalalabad, located 150 kilometers east of Kabul, is Afghanistan's third-largest city with a population of approximately 350,000.

According to the latest information, the intense bombardment and shelling by the Kabul government forces have prevented about 14,000 Afghan Mujahideen gathered on the outskirts of Jalalabad from advancing.

On March 8th, the Afghan Mujahideen captured the military stronghold of Samahar on the outskirts of Jalalabad. Currently, around 500 Mujahideen are stationed there, using it as a base to attack Jalalabad.

Afghan Mujahideen sources recently claimed that in the past few days, they have killed hundreds of government soldiers, shot down three aircraft, and destroyed several government tanks and armored vehicles.

The Mujahideen sources said that during the battle, approximately 400 Kabul government soldiers surrendered. They have been escorted to Pakistan. Meanwhile, a large number of wounded Afghan Mujahideen have been sent to hospitals in Pakistan.

A spokesperson for the International Red Cross surgical hospital said that the hospital has been receiving an average of 20 Afghan Mujahideen per day recently. To cope with the sudden influx of wounded, the hospital has had to set up tents inside the premises.

　　贾拉拉巴德激战进入第十天
    新华社伊斯兰堡３月１５日电  （记者汤水富）阿富汗游击队和喀布尔政府军在贾拉拉巴德外围的攻防战到今天已进入第１０天。
    贾拉拉巴德市位于喀布尔以东１５０公里处，是阿富汗的第三大城市，人口约３５万。
    据此间最新获悉的消息，喀布尔政府军的猛烈轰炸和炮击，使聚集在贾拉拉巴德市外围的约１４０００名阿富汗游击队员无法靠近。
    本月８日，阿富汗游击队攻陷了贾拉拉巴德郊区的军事要塞——萨马赫尔。目前，大约有５００名游击队员驻守在那里，并以此作为攻打贾拉拉巴德市的基地。
    阿富汗游击队人士最近声称，在过去的几天里，游击队打死几百名政府军官兵，击落３架飞机，摧毁政府军数辆坦克和装甲车。
    游击队人士说，战斗过程中大约有４００名喀布尔政府军投降。他们已被押解到巴基斯坦境内。与此同时，在围攻贾拉拉巴德市受伤的阿富汗游击队员也大批被送往巴基斯坦境内的医院。
    国际红十字会外科医院的人士说，这家医院近来每天平均接收２０名阿富汗游击队员。为应付大量伤员的突然到来，医院不得不在院内搭起帐篷。
