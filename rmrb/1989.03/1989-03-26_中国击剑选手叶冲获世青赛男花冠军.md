Chinese fencer Ye Chong won the men's foil championship at the 40th World Youth Fencing Championships held here tonight. He defeated last year's runner-up, Thomas Endres of the Federal Republic of Germany, with a score of 10-8.

This is the first time a Chinese fencer has stood on the champion's podium at the World Youth Fencing Championships. Previously, in the 1978 World Youth Fencing Championships, Lu Junjie had won the silver medal in the women's foil event.

In tonight's semi-final and final, Ye Chong, despite being behind in the score, remained calm and fought back, turning the tables and securing victory.

The second to fourth place winners in the men's foil event were Thomas Endres of the Federal Republic of Germany, Adi Russo of Italy, and Lemu of the German Democratic Republic.

Today was the second day of the championships. Tomorrow, the women's epee competition will be held. China's Yan Jing and Zhi Hui will participate in this event.
