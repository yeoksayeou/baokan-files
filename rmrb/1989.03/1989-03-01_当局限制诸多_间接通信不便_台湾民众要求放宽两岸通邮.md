	Authorities Impose Numerous Restrictions, Indirect Communication Inconvenient,
	Taiwanese People Demand Easing of Cross-Strait Mail Services

	New China News Agency Hong Kong, February 28th - According to reports from Taiwanese newspapers, Taiwanese people are dissatisfied with the current method of indirect communication with the mainland through the Taiwan Red Cross Society and are demanding further opening of cross-strait mail services.

	Since Taiwan opened indirect communication with the mainland on April 18th of last year, by the end of last December, 1.98 million letters had been sent from Taiwan to the mainland, and 2.03 million letters had been sent from the mainland to Taiwan. As the volume of mail between the two sides increased rapidly, the Taiwan Red Cross Society, which is responsible for forwarding mail for Taiwanese people, has been overwhelmed, and the cumbersome mailing procedures have caused great inconvenience to the public. The "Taiwan Postal Administration" also admits that sending mail to the mainland requires enveloping, and the inner envelope cannot have the address of the Taiwanese sender, causing difficulties in returning undeliverable mail. Additionally, the regulation that each airmail letter cannot exceed 20 grams is far from meeting the public's communication needs, and there are even cases where a long letter has to be divided into two or three parts to be sent, which is unreasonable. The Taiwanese people have repeatedly expressed their grievances about this.

	Mailing parcels between the two sides is an even bigger problem. The "Taiwan Postal Administration" often receives parcels from the mainland via Hong Kong or other regions, but due to "policy," they can only return the parcels unopened. As for Taiwanese people hoping to send parcels or remittances to the mainland, they are uniformly rejected. Due to the obstruction of normal mail routes, Taiwanese people have no choice but to use high-priced private express services to send parcels to the mainland. They are very dissatisfied with this and are calling on the decision-making authorities to further open up.

### 当局限制诸多　间接通信不便  台湾民众要求放宽两岸通邮

　　当局限制诸多　间接通信不便
    台湾民众要求放宽两岸通邮
    新华社香港２月２８日电  据台湾报纸报道，台湾民众不满目前当局所规定的透过台湾红十字会间接与大陆通信方式，要求进一步开放两岸通邮。
    去年４月１８日台湾开放两岸间接通信后，至去年１２月底，台胞寄往大陆的信有１９８万多件，大陆寄到台湾的信有２０３万多件。随着两岸来往信件的迅速增加，使负责为台胞转信的台湾红十字会早感不胜负荷，而繁琐的寄信手续更造成民众的极不方便。台湾“邮政总局”也承认，交寄大陆信以套封交寄，且内装的信封上不得书写台湾寄件人的地址，造成无法退信的困扰，而且规定每封航空平信不得超过２０克，早已不敷民众通信需要，甚至出现一封长信要分成二、三封分寄的不合理现象。台湾民众对此迭生怨言。
    两岸间邮寄包裹更是一大难题。台湾“邮政局”经常收到由香港或其他地区转去的大陆包裹，碍于“政策”只得原包裹退回。至于台湾民众希望邮寄包裹或汇款往大陆，则一概被拒绝受理。由于正常邮路受阻，台湾老百姓不得不以高价通过民间快递服务公司向大陆寄包裹。他们对此极为不满，纷纷要求决策当局进一步开放。
