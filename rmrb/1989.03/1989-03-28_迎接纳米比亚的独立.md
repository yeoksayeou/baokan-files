	As April 1 approaches, the issue of Namibia's independence, the last colony on the African continent, has once again drawn global attention.

	According to the agreement signed on December 22 last year by Angola, Cuba, and South Africa regarding the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola and Namibia's independence, Namibia will begin implementing United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 starting April 1. This resolution stipulates that South African troops should withdraw from Namibia, and all parties involved should cooperate with the UN Secretary-General to ensure free and fair elections in Namibia by November, leading to its independence. All parties should respect Namibia's territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders. The fact that Namibia, which has been illegally occupied by South Africa for 74 years, is on the verge of independence marks the end of the decolonization process on the African continent. This has significant implications for the future political and economic landscape of Southern Africa.

	Namibia was previously a German colony and was later illegally annexed by South Africa. Using Namibia as a springboard, South Africa has repeatedly conducted military incursions into Angola and other neighboring countries, seriously threatening peace and stability in Southern Africa and making the region one of the world's hotspots. The Namibian people have waged a relentless struggle for independence, and the international community has actively provided support and solidarity. The long-cherished wish of the Namibian people for independence will finally be realized as the UN Resolution 435 is gradually implemented. This victory is the fruit of the long struggle of the Namibian people, supported by the African people, especially the people of the frontline states.

	Against the backdrop of a generally easing international situation, the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, have sought to stabilize the situation in Southern Africa by pushing for negotiations and agreements among the relevant parties. South Africa also aims to extricate itself from the increasingly isolated position it has found itself in due to its aggressive expansion. These external factors have undoubtedly accelerated the process of Namibia's independence.

	However, recent actions by the South African authorities have deepened concerns about the situation in Namibia. Even before the implementation of Resolution 435, some Namibian patriots have been killed by white gangs and pro-South African forces. The South African authorities are also employing tactics aimed at undermining free and fair elections in Namibia, attempting to weaken the potential advantage of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in the November elections. Notably, as Resolution 435 is implemented, the status of Walvis Bay may become an obstacle to Namibia's independence process. This deep-water port on Namibia's long coastline has been under South African military control. The South African authorities have so far refused to acknowledge it as part of Namibian territory, which understandably provokes the indignation of the Namibian people.

	Namibia is finally on the brink of independence, which is cause for celebration. However, the path to Namibia's independence will not be smooth, and all parties involved need to make concrete efforts to ensure the implementation of the agreement, so that Namibia can achieve independence as scheduled.

### 迎接纳米比亚的独立

　　迎接纳米比亚的独立
    随着４月１日的临近，非洲大陆上最后一个殖民地纳米比亚的独立问题，再次引起世人的关注。
    根据安哥拉、古巴和南非去年１２月２２日正式签署的关于古巴从安哥拉撤军和纳米比亚独立的协议，纳米比亚将自４月１日起开始实施联合国安理会４３５号决议。该决议规定，南非军队应撤出纳米比亚，有关各方应同联合国秘书长合作，确保今年１１月在纳米比亚通过自由公正的选举宣告独立，各方应尊重纳米比亚的领土完整和边境不受侵犯。被南非非法占领达７４年的纳米比亚独立有期，标志着非洲大陆非殖民化进程结束在望，这对南部非洲今后政治、经济格局的演变具有重大意义。
    纳米比亚过去是德国殖民地，后被南非非法吞并。南非以纳米比亚为跳板，不断对安哥拉和其它邻国进行军事侵扰，严重威胁到南部非洲的和平与稳定，使该地区成为世界热点之一。纳米比亚人民为争取独立展开了艰苦卓绝的斗争，国际社会也积极给予声援和支持。纳米比亚人民梦寐以求的独立愿望，终将在逐步贯彻执行联合国４３５号决议后得以实现。这是纳米比亚人民在非洲人民，特别是前线国家人民支持下进行长期斗争赢得的胜利成果。
    在国际形势日趋缓和的大背景下，美苏两个超级大国为谋求南部非洲局势相对稳定，力促有关各方面通过谈判达成协议。南非也力图摆脱因侵略扩张而日益孤立的处境。这些外部因素，无疑也加速了纳米比亚的独立进程。
    然而，南非当局最近的一些做法加深了人们对纳米比亚局势的疑虑。４３５号决议尚未实施，已有一部分纳米比亚爱国人士遭到白人团伙和亲南非势力的枪杀。南非当局还玩弄旨在破坏纳米比亚自由和公正选举的手法，力图削弱１１月选举时西南非洲人民组织取得可能的优势。尤其值得注意的是，随着４３５号决议的实施，沃尔维斯港的归属问题很可能成为纳米比亚独立进程的障碍。这个纳米比亚千里海岸线上唯一的深水港口，一直在南非的军事控制之下。南非当局迄今拒不承认它是纳米比亚领土的一部分，这不能不激起纳米比亚人民的愤慨。
    纳米比亚终于要独立了，值得庆贺。但纳米比亚独立进程不可能一帆风顺，需要有关各方作出切实的努力，保证协议的实施，使纳米比亚如期实现独立。
