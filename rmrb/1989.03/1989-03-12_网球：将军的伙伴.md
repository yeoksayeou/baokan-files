Tennis: The General's Companion

By Chen Weiwei and Shu Yu, reporters for this newspaper

Yesterday, he was a military leader; today, he has "laid down his arms" and retired. General He Zhengwen, who is over seventy, did not find this sudden.

"When you get old, you have to retire—it's a natural law!" Old General He smiled and said to us, "Even after retirement, one must do things within one's abilities and exercise is not to be taken lightly."

Before his retirement, Old General He was the Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army. A lifetime of military service instilled in him many good habits, which he continues to maintain. He wakes up at 5:30 AM, runs 3,000 meters around the courtyard, and has "corn porridge" for breakfast. In the morning, he usually reads documents and newspapers, handles some affairs, and spends most of the afternoon on the tennis court.

When it comes to tennis, Old General He proudly points to the more than ten trophies displayed in the living room: "Look, these are my trophies!" The reporter walked to the most beautiful trophy to admire it, and it was inscribed: "1987 Beijing City Senior Tennis Championship Runner-up."

Old General He was a "sports enthusiast" even during the war years. In the Red Army era, he played basketball with General Zhu, and during the Anti-Japanese War, he participated in the baseball team. However, for him, the most attractive sport was still tennis. His friendship with this sport has lasted for at least 30 years.

General He's wife, Comrade Wan Ling, is truly a "good wife." Whenever Old General He feels unwell, she steps in to stop any strenuous activities. But once Old General He recovers, he immediately begs his wife to "lift the alert" and then returns to the court with his racket. Old General He said: "Taking it easy has no meaning. Life lies in movement. Playing tennis has benefited me a lot. Old ailments like bronchitis have not bothered me in years."

　　网球：将军的伙伴
    本报记者  陈维伟  舒瑜
    昨日是三军将领，今天已“卸甲”离休。对此，年逾古稀的何正文将军并未感到突然。
    “年老了，就要退——自然规律嘛！”何老笑着对我们说。“离休了，还要干些力所能及的事，锻炼身体也马虎不得。”
    老将军离休前是解放军副总参谋长。戎马一生，养成了很多良好的生活习惯，离休后仍然保持着。他早晨五点半起床，围小院跑步３０００米，早餐必有“棒子糊糊”，上午一般看看文件、报纸，处理一些事情，下午基本上是在网球场度过。
    提起网球，何老自豪地指着客厅里陈设的十多个奖杯：“喏，这都是我的战利品！”记者走到一只最漂亮的奖杯前观赏，上面铭刻着：１９８７年荣获北京市老年网球比赛亚军。
    何老早在战争年代就是个“体育迷”，红军时代曾与朱老总打过篮球，抗日时期参加过棒球队。不过，对他来讲，最有吸引力的还是网球。与这个伙伴结缘，至少也有３０多个年头了。
    将军的夫人万玲同志堪称“贤内助”。何老稍有不适，她便前来挡驾：禁止剧烈活动。但何老身体一旦恢复，马上又央求老伴“解除警报”，然后挥拍重返球场。何老说：“偷闲没啥子意思，生命在于运动。打网球使我受益不少，像老毛病气管炎这些年也不怎么犯了。”
