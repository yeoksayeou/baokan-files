Japan's experience in successfully modernizing lies in its comprehensive and multi-level introduction of Western culture, enriching and complementing its own culture. This integration of "scientific civilization, democracy, and traditional culture" is the key to Japan's modern success.

After the Meiji Restoration, Japan transitioned from a feudal society to a capitalist one, gradually achieving modernization. The key to this success was establishing a modern model that combines "scientific civilization, democracy, and traditional culture." This model uses Western democracy as its foundation, high technology as its means, and Japanese traditional culture as its core. Japanese traditional culture plays a crucial role in modernization.

Japan's absorption of foreign cultures is highly active, yet its cultural self-identity remains unshaken. It adheres to strict self-regulation. Japanese culture maintains a strong sense of traditional continuity and innovation, eliminating feudal dross that does not fit modern societal development and incorporating democratic elements. Japanese culture is infused with national character, including psychological traits, thinking methods, aesthetic tastes, and even customs and habits. Therefore, the fusion of Japanese culture with foreign cultures inherently carries creative significance. The self-identity in Japanese culture is not about cultural self-sameness or exclusivity; it has a strong capacity for acceptance and digestion. With its self-identity as the center, it absorbs as much of the world's cultural essence as possible, creating a multi-faceted Japanese culture. This, in turn, regulates Japan's cultural modernization, ultimately achieving cultural optimization.

In establishing its self-identity and pursuing self-value, modern Japanese culture also has strict self-discipline, maintaining itself within social morality and order. This forms a group consciousness within the culture, which becomes an important basis for self-regulation. The Japanese people's adherence to discipline, hard work, and creative labor in social and cultural life stem from this. In short, only by fully developing the self and individuality within the culture can the group have vitality, and social culture have vibrant energy and strong cohesion. If one were to use a unified ideology and single thinking pattern to regulate self-behavior without achieving cultural diversity based on the establishment of a cultural creative subject, it would be hard to imagine Japan's modernization being successful.

Modern Japanese culture is open. It not only absorbs Western political culture (democratic participation), management, and scientific civilization but also introduces Western culture comprehensively and multi-levelly. However, it avoids "complete Westernization." This is due to the emphasis on national characteristics within Japanese culture, maintaining cultural self-awareness. Upon encountering Japanese culture, one can easily discover that the integrated foreign culture is deeply embedded in the nation's spiritual and material cultural life, harmoniously blending with it.

For example, in literature, art, and sports, Japan has a fusion of Eastern and Western elements, as well as modern and traditional elements. However, the dominant role is played by Japanese traditional elements. For instance, the writers Kawabata Yasunari and the painter Tohoku Kaitai have absorbed more Western techniques than spiritual elements, while inheriting Japanese traditional culture, they emphasize spirit over technique, always using Japanese cultural thought as the foundation. They "jointly consider the position of 'fusion' or 'bridge' between Eastern and Western cultures" (Kawabata Yasunari's words), thus forming new national characteristics. We can also see how Japanese Kabuki, Gagaku, and Noh theater, in their fusion with Western ballet and opera, and Sumo, Judo, and Karate in their exchange with Western boxing and wrestling, actively develop their respective national characteristics.

The same applies to Japan's material culture in clothing, food, and housing. In terms of clothing, there are both formal Western suits and colorful kimonos, complementing each other. In terms of food, the Japanese not only enjoy their own green tea and matcha but also love Western coffee and Chinese tea. Canned drinks have also become daily beverages. A Japanese friend told me that Chinese Oolong tea has entered thousands of Japanese households, even reaching rural homes. Dishes primarily feature Japanese "ryori," but also incorporate various international flavors. Architecture includes both "Wa-style" and Western styles, often combining both. Western-style rooms are furnished with modern furniture, while "Wa-style" rooms are laid with tatami mats, blending naturally.

Japan's cultural experience shows that a country's culture, if it maintains self-confidence and preserves its national and creative subjectivity, will undoubtedly enrich and develop itself through exchanges with other national cultures. It will become the driving force behind the country's modernization efforts.

　　日本文化与现代化
    叶渭渠
    全方位、多层次地引进西方文化，借以充实和丰富自己，融合“科技文明、民主主义和传统文化”，是日本现代化成功的经验。
    明治维新以后，日本从封建社会向资本主义社会过渡，逐步实现了现代化，其成功的经验，就是确立了以“科技文明、民主主义和传统文化结合”的现代化模式，即以西方的民主主义为基础、高度的技术文明为手段，以日本民族的传统文化为根本。日本民族的传统文化发挥着现代化的主体作用。
    日本文化对外来文化的吸收尽管非常活跃，但日本民族文化的自我主体却并未因此动摇，它蕴含着严格的自我规范。日本文化具有民族传统的强烈继承性和延续性，又能不断革新，剔除一些不适应现代社会发展的封建糟粕，增加民主主义的成分。日本文化渗透着民族的性格，其中包括民族的心理素质、思维方法、审美情趣，乃至风俗习惯。因此，日本文化与外来文化融合本身就包含着创造的意义。日本文化中的自我主体不是文化上的自我同一，亦不是封闭和排他，它有相当强的受容力和消化力，以其自我主体为中心，尽可能多地吸收世界文化的精华，造成日本文化的多元性，并以此来规范日本文化的现代化，最终达到文化优选的目的。
    近代日本文化在确立自我主体地位，追求自我价值的基础上，又有严格的自我约束，将自我维系在社会道德和秩序之上，形成文化中的群体意识，这种意识又成为自我规范的重要依据。日本人在社会生活和文化生活中严守纪律、拚命实干以及创造性的劳动，盖源于此。简言之，只有充分发挥文化中的自我和个性，群体才有生气，社会文化才有勃发的活力和坚固的凝聚力。如果只用统一的思想意识、单一的思维模式来规范自我行为，而没有在确立文化的创造主体的基础上实现文化形态的多元性，很难设想，日本的现代化会成功。
    近代日本文化是开放性的，它不仅仅吸收西方的政治文化（民主参与）、经营管理和科技文明，而且全方位多层次地引进西方文化，但没有出现“全盘西化”，这正是由于日本文化中民族性的发扬，日本文化保持了主体意识。只要接触日本文化，就很容易发现，结合在其中的外来文化不仅深深地积淀在这个民族的精神文化生活中，而且和谐地组合在这个民族的物质文化生活里。
    譬如，日本文学、艺术、体育诸方面有东方与西方的结合，也有现代与传统的融合，而起着主体作用的却是日本的、传统的东西。就中国读者熟悉的作家川端康成和画家东山魁夷来说，他们吸收西方文化的技巧多于精神，而继承日本传统的民族文化则精神多于技巧，并始终以日本文化思想作为根基。他们“共同思考东西方文化的‘融合’或‘桥梁’的位置”（川端康成语），从而形成新的民族特质。我们还可以看到日本的歌舞伎、雅乐、能乐在与西方的芭蕾、歌剧的融合中，日本的相扑、柔道、空手道在与西方的拳击、摔跤的交流中积极地发展着各自的民族个性。
    日本的衣、食、住诸方面的物质文化也如此。就衣着来说，有笔挺、庄重的西装，也有五彩缤纷的和服，两者互相点缀。就“食”来说，日本人不仅喜欢饮用自己的粗茶、抹茶，而且也爱喝西方咖啡和中国茶，易拉罐也成了日常饮料。一位日本朋友告诉我，中国乌龙茶已进入日本千家万户，连山村农舍也普及了。菜肴以日本“料理”为主体，又融合了各国风味，建筑有“和式”也有洋式，摆设常常是兼而有之，洋室摆放现代家具，“和室”则铺设“榻榻米”，组合得非常自然。
    日本文化的经验证明，一国的文化，如果不失其自信，保持其民族的、创造的主体，就一定能在与其他民族文化的交流中，不断地丰富和发展自己，进而成为推动本国现代化事业发展的主体力量。
