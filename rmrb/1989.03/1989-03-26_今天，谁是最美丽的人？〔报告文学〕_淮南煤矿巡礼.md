Today, who is the most beautiful person? - A Tour of the Huainan Coal Mines

Currently, the word "beauty" has become a hot topic of discussion among people and almost everyone's pursuit. Despite various fashion shows dazzling the eyes and beauty pageants becoming a trendy temptation, some people who do not want to drift aimlessly with the tide, some people with brains, aspirations, ideals, and ambitions, are increasingly feeling that there is a serious question in our lives that needs to be answered seriously: In this land of ours, to whom should beauty belong? In a time when everyone feels they are beautiful, who is the most beautiful person?

They, they, they...

My home is on the yellow earth hill, the wind blows over the hill...

"I feel that no matter where, no matter when, we should say: Our miners are the most beautiful!" These words were spoken by Yang Zongzhen, the director of the Huainan Mining Bureau.

"Yang Zongzhen is a real man!" Before coming to Huainan, I had heard such comments. After arriving in Huainan, my impression of him deepened. "In the relay race of Huainan Coal Mine, I must run this leg at full speed!" The first time I met Old Yang, I heard him say this. And after visiting six out of the eight coal mines in Huainan, I found that Yang Zongzhen's words were also the voice of the hearts of countless coal miners, including Wu Youzhong, the Party Committee Secretary of the Mining Bureau. No, not just the voice, but also the real, moving deeds and stories of countless coal miners.

"One should say: Our miners are the most beautiful!" I gradually understood that this beauty is completely connected with the relay race and speed. As the cage slowly descends, I was sent to the underground layer 500 meters below. The cage was damp and uncomfortable. The rumbling sound was not particularly pleasant. This is the Kongji Coal Mine with 5,800 people. The tunnel is a muddy river, although the people walking with me kept greeting me, my two feet kept sinking into the black mud.

"From this tunnel to the coal mining site, there are several kilometers. Miners go to work and come back every day by walking," said Deputy Director Wei as we sat in the man-car. "Don't ride the man-car?" "Sometimes you can't get on it."

Although it was just a few pieces of rusty iron, covered in stains and wet everywhere, in the dim light, the man-car seemed as proud as a thousand-mile horse. "Is this the worst car in the world?" Thinking of the Crowns, Bluebirds, Nissans, and Subarus flying everywhere in the sunlight, and the least noticeable Porsche, I hung the iron chain that served as the door and joked, "This must be the worst car in the world." The coal mining team leader immediately corrected me: "You can't say that. For us miners, it is the best car in the world." "Why?" "Because it never takes people to sightsee, never takes people for a ride, to enjoy life. It only goes to and fro for us miners, for us to mine coal." Instantly, countless luxurious hotels, restaurants, amusement parks, dance halls, and nightclubs flashed through my memory. The man-car continued to rumble forward, without a sofa cushion, the seat was just a steel plate splattered with muddy water. It was raining in the tunnel, there were no seasons, no red leaves falling, no dancing snowflakes. There were no fitness pants, and certainly no long, shimmering hair. The man-car bounced badly, my miner's hat hit the steel beam on the top. "Be careful, don't hit it." The coal mining team leader's voice was very gentle. When the light from my miner's lamp shone on his face, for a moment, his close-up appeared before me: lowered eyebrows, broad and simple, beard unshaven for a few days, wrinkles at the corners of his eyes. As if shy, he rarely looked me in the eye when speaking. Despite this, I discovered that his deep, black eyes held a kind of invisible burning, a kind of invisible splendor, a kind of ability, a kind of coal-like demeanor. "Why did you choose the coal mining profession?" He smiled slightly, his eyes still not looking at me, but I was sure his smile was no worse than anyone else's. "I was sent down to the countryside and recruited to work here." "How many years have you been here?" "More than ten years." "Are you married?" "Yes, and I have a child." "Do you like coal mining?" "I can't say I like it, and I can't say I don't like it. The country needs coal, and someone has to mine it."

At the moment the man-car stopped, he stood up from the door. In the dim light, he suddenly turned around, and I discovered that his eyes were filled with a certain charm. It was a kind of black charm, a black allure, like coal, deeply buried, and silently contained.

"One should say: Our miners are the most beautiful!" Yang Zongzhen's words thundered through my chest.

No matter if it's the southeast wind or the northwest wind, they are all my songs, my songs...

The rain was falling, of course, it was a kind of rain in the tunnel, the raindrops falling into the collar made one think of the season when plums are in full bloom. By the Taihu Lake, by the West Lake, in the Mei Garden, in the Dengwei, in the golden and red mist, how many couples are strolling by? But here there are no plums, only the flickering of miner's lamps. On one side of this tunnel, in a patch of black mud, miners were having their meals. Some squatted, some stood, some even sat in the muddy water. Their bodies were dirty, their faces were black. Some had even taken off their jackets, exposing their upper bodies, of course, their bodies were also black. Each person held a lunchbox. They also exchanged a few words from time to time. They were the Paris Commune members who could speak. The Internationale, which had been silent for a long time, suddenly echoed in my chest.

They squatted in the water, sat in the mud, a mouthful of cold rice, a mouthful of cold water, for what? For the more than 100 yuan a month? No, selling chickens, selling fish, selling green vegetables, selling radishes, in this place where miners live together, one can earn at least 10 yuan a day, and in a month, with a little effort, 300 yuan can easily be put into one's pocket. Why do they have to work so hard in this dirty and bitter place? "Why? Isn't it for the coal?" Their answer had no depth, no more logic, no elegant words, almost no heroic speeches. They also have parents, also have wives and children. They know that there is no gold, no silver, no official hats, no honors, no foreign scenery here. What there is, however, is astonishing hardship, the constant possibility of life-threatening danger, and the endless worry of parents and the eternal nightmare of wives that will never wake up. "If you don't do the coal mining work, he doesn't do it, who will mine the coal underground?" The words of the coal miner Yuan Shengli might answer this question.

We had already reached the end of the tunnel, not knowing where to go next, when the coal mining team leader bent down and opened the cover on the side of the tunnel. "We will climb up from here." Deputy Director Wei looked at me with a scholar's gaze, his eyes seemed to say, "Can you do it?"

I followed Deputy Director Wei and crawled into the hole. This hole was a fashionable pair of jeans, not too big, not too small, just tight enough to wrap around your body. In front of me, the coal wall, which was sometimes straight up and down and sometimes tilted inward, was a one-meter-long steel rod ladder. When climbing up, you use both hands to grab the top and both feet to step on the bottom. Because three shifts of workers go up and down here every day, each section of the steel rod is wet and slippery. I stood up straight in the hole and looked up, but I couldn't see where the exit was, only a string of dim lights. The hole was straight up and down. There is only one path up the ancient Huashan Mountain. I followed him up the ladder. At this moment, for some reason, I suddenly thought of the scenes described by Dante in "The Divine Comedy." "Grab tight with both hands!" someone kept shouting from below. The higher I climbed, the more I felt that there was no sky above and no ground below. I gradually felt that my inner clothes were damp, and the cotton vest I changed into when I went down the mine was also damp. Sweat, like raindrops, rolled down my cheeks. "How deep is this hole?" "Forty meters." I calculated in my mind: 40 meters, 120 feet. Almost as high as a 10-story building. "You climb it once, and when you write the article, it will definitely be a masterpiece!" My heart suddenly echoed with Yang Zongzhen's laughter, and I kept climbing up. But this was not climbing Mount Lu, nor was it visiting the Dragon Palace Cave. Although it was also a place of extraordinary scenery, gentlemen would not visit here. This treasure land, this treasure mountain, this treasure cave, is not a tourist attraction. It belongs only to Yang Zongzhen and his miners.

"Damn, the power is out again!" The TV turned off. The stereo stopped. The neon lights went out. But do you know where the electricity comes from? Generating electricity requires coal, and where does the coal come from?

When the sunset...

There is no sunset here. When the miner pulled me out of the hole, for a moment, I felt my body was as heavy as the earth. "Rest a bit, there is another hole to crawl into below." We sat on the deer platform. Not far away, there was a miner. His body was all black. He was almost naked. "Tired?" He looked at me. "Used to it, it's just that." I stared at him for a long time, his gaze was so stern, so pure. This surprised me greatly. For some reason, at that moment, I felt that I had already left the mortal world. The worldly turmoil that I was familiar with in the eyes of others was not here. Only naked hearts, only him wrapped in coal dust, standing there so innocently. No evil thoughts. No greed. No adornment. No makeup. Whether people know his name or not, he didn't care. He didn't care about high and low, didn't care about seating and ranking. But he was doing the greatest work. Sending light and energy, heat and power, to the country, to the people. And he himself was just a piece of coal, an ordinary piece of coal.

They, they, they...

They are in the mine, and they are on the ground.

An old miner who had dug coal all his life and was now retired begged the mine director: "Mine director, give me a room!" My tears immediately welled up. In an instant, I felt dizzy. Countless tunnels. Countless black holes. Countless times of going up and down the mine, countless times of climbing and rolling. Countless times of coal dust in the nose, mouth, face, and body. Countless times of cold meals and cold tea. Countless times of getting up early and going to bed late. Countless times of worrying. Countless times of the alarm clock ringing suddenly. Countless times of the mother's reminders, the wife's expectations. Countless times of coal cars rumbling past, coal rivers rushing. Countless times of flowers blooming and falling. Countless times of spring going and winter coming. Countless times of yesterday's stars. Countless times of tonight's lights, years, life, cage, wind drill. 30 years, everything was in chaos. Only coal wrote two mountain-like big characters for him: miner.

"What is the housing situation here?" The mine director's answer was a bitter smile. "What about other mines?" "About the same." "No, I came to Sheyi Mine a few years ago. There were rows of dormitory buildings, single miners' dormitories were hotel-like. There were also quite beautiful kindergartens..." "What you said is true, but that is the situation outside the painted wall."

"Let's go to Erdaohe and take a look." Deputy Director Wei called the administrative department head. "You ask about Erdaohe? That was the house built by the labor reform team during the construction of the Huai River Dike in 1958, now it is for miners to live in." "What? Labor reform team?" ... All the hosts no longer answered my question, and at this time I noticed that the mine director's eyes were red for the first time.

My home is on the yellow earth hill, the wind blows over the hill...

"Let's talk about the mine director and deputy mine director first." The administrative department head's face had no smile. "Don't talk about us." "How can we not talk about it? The mine director and deputy mine director's office have a small bed, and they hardly go home once a year, even if it is close. Even on New Year's Day, they rarely go home." "Don't talk about that, don't talk about that!" Deputy Director Wei interrupted the administrative department head's words. "Alright, then let's introduce the coal miners: Wang Jiantang, who has been mining coal for 11 years."

We arrived at Erdaohe. We got off the car. Here it was all muddy without a bottom. Now it was winter. One could imagine what it would be like here in the summer. We pushed open a door and walked in. A child was crying on the edge of the bed. The woman of the house had gone to buy vegetables. Bamboo fence walls. No windows. The bed was covered with reed mats. There was a bowl of leftover tofu on the dining table. The man of the house had probably just finished the early shift, with red blood vessels in the corners of his eyes. "What is your name?" The miners I met were all equally honest and simple. Where did all the good people in the world go to mine coal? "Liang Changai." He did not have the gaze of so many people I had seen before. Although he was not doing well, the spring in his heart was clear, not like the muddy road in front of his door. He was over 30 years old. Not talkative. You ask what he answers. "What do you do?" "In the mine, I am a transportation worker." He was originally standing there, but suddenly, as if he had thought of something, he ran to the bed and took out a pack of cigarettes. Here, people call this kind of cigarette "Great Unity." This is the cigarette miners smoke, 52 cents a pack. He took out the cigarettes one by one and handed them to us with both hands. I might have seen him in the mine. But at that time, his face was all covered with coal dust. "How many people are there?" "Four. Two children." "Father?" "He is also a coal miner, he has been mining for 21 years and is now retired." "How many years have you been mining?" "11 years." "Salary?" "150 yuan a month." I saw that his room was leaking in some places. Although it had been repaired and patched, it was still riddled with holes. He saw us, including his mine director and team leader, and had no complaints, no grievances, as if mining coal and living in such a place were his duties.

Across the alley, in the yard, was the home of the underground electrician Zhang Tonghua. He started mining in 1958 and worked in the mine for 20 years, now he is retired, with a monthly salary of 80 yuan, living in two tilted, dilapidated rooms. His eldest son, Zhang Jun, has taken over his job and has been working underground as a tunneling worker for 4 years. He probably just got married recently, and when we entered the door, the young wife was breastfeeding the child in her arms, still dressed like a bride. While Zhang Tonghua, who had been a miner for 20 years, was only wearing a thin, patched cotton jacket, with a piece of broken cloth tied around his waist. "How is life?" "This is it, not working anymore, still getting 80 yuan a month, the country is in trouble, we can't ask for too much." "You have been working underground for 20 years, and your son is following in your footsteps, aren't you afraid of hardship?" "Hardship? I love this job. Look, my younger son wants to do it but can't." The tall Zhang Jun standing next to him sweetly smiled. He felt that being an underground tunneling worker, earning 90 yuan a month, was already something to be proud of compared to his younger brother. While his younger brother was only a temporary worker at the lime kiln. Nothing else, earning 1.25 yuan a day.

"You live where?" "Me? I have a place." He pointed to a small house across the yard, covered with cow hair felt and pressed with broken bricks, about 5 square meters. The door only reached my chest. I pushed the door open. The roof almost hit my head, I couldn't stand up straight. The entire house was occupied by a broken bed. His wife, who had gone through wind and rain with him for half his life, was lying on the bed, sick. Rainwater from the roof was dripping, drop by drop, onto her bed. She covered the quilt with a piece of plastic sheet. The rainwater flowed along the edge of the plastic sheet and onto the floor in front of the bed, forming a small pool of water.

Seeing all this on the surface, and thinking of all that underground, I could only struggle to hold back my tears.

Mountains have big trees, hills have small trees...

On the day we went to Panji Mine, it started to snow. This was the first snow of the year. On December 9, 1987, this mine had experienced a gas explosion accident.

Of course, facing such shocking news, the panic and pain of relatives are imaginable. But what about the miners? Miners are still miners! After the accident, the workers of the Comprehensive Mining Area 1, Yang Jiankuan, were taken home by their relatives, and his wife cried and begged him to do anything else but not mine coal again. He patiently persuaded his wife and returned to the mine. After the accident, the workers of the Tunneling Area 1, Ma Shengli, were taken home by his mother and wife from Sheyi Mine, and they cried and dragged him back home, locking him in the room. But as soon as his mother and wife left, he jumped out of the window and quickly returned to the mine. After the accident, the Communist Party member Huang Bingcheng of the Tunneling Area 3 was injured in the foot by the shock wave of the explosion, although he was saved from the brink of death, but he bravely endured the pain and actively participated in the rescue, without asking for leave or rest. After the accident, the Communist Party member Guo Tianjun of the Comprehensive Mining Area 2 had a fever and took sick leave. When he heard that there was an accident, he insisted on going to work despite his illness. When the leader asked him why he didn't rest at home, he said: "The mine has an accident, there are fewer workers, I am a Communist Party member, at this time I should step forward!"

"One should say: Our miners are the most beautiful!" As I delved deeper into the investigation and interviews, I felt more and more the true weight and profound meaning of Yang Zongzhen's words!

Upon arriving at Panji Mine, the first thing I saw was a noticeably posted telegram from the provincial party secretary Lu Rongzhi on January 4th. Lu Rongzhi came to visit all the workers of the mine after learning that some workers were not very stable in their minds after the gas explosion accident. The warm care of the provincial party secretary greatly encouraged all the workers of the mine. In 1988, the production situation of Panji Mine was better than any other year, and the state-assigned coal production task was overfulfilled. Lu Rongzhi's telegram was sent for this reason.

It is not often seen that a provincial party secretary sends a telegram directly to a coal mine. A leader is not just about issuing orders from above, but also about going down to the grassroots, using one's spiritual power to influence and mobilize a large number of people's enthusiasm. This is undoubtedly a leadership art worth paying attention to in the current situation.

There must be brave generals to have heroic soldiers. The victory of Panji Mine is inseparable from the efforts of Yang Zongzhen and his team. In order to catch up with the time and speed, as the director of the mine, Yang Zongzhen often does not let go of a single second. Because of this, in 1988, he had two car accidents in one year. The first time was on July 26th. He returned from a meeting in Longkou, Shandong, and did not stop to enjoy the charming scenery of the seaside in summer. He insisted on driving back to Huainan that night. Driving at night and at high speed, he fell off the bridge while overtaking. He broke six ribs, had seven fracture points all over his body, and crawled out of the car window, standing straight and walking several miles to the nearest county hospital. Back in Huainan, he was admitted to the hospital, but he did not sleep flat on the bed for a single day. His ward was the conference room, the reception room. Here, he presided over meetings, listened to reports from all sides, and received various visitors. With both hands supporting his head, enduring the intense pain throughout his body. The whole summer, he endured it like this. Unexpectedly, the seven fractures healed by his own life force, he was once again a straight-standing man. On January 27th, in order to rush to Zhenjiang for a meeting, he had his second car accident. His forehead was injured and he was stitched up with six stitches.

Two consecutive car accidents, his driver cried. But he still worked as usual, calmly and tensely.

We, we, we...

The coal city after the snow seemed particularly quiet. However, facing this good night just decorated by the first snow, my mind was always thinking about the nearly ten-story-high miner's passage, thinking about the damp and steep passage, and wondering how many workers had climbed over it. I thought of the man-car, thought of the miners squatting in the muddy pool enjoying their cold and simple working lunch, thought of their sacrifices, their hard work in the wind and snow, thought of their simple and crude housing, thought of their past and present lives. At the same time, I also thought of us, thought of so many of us.

Although it is a coal city, there are still Hong Kong Street and Macao Street here, some unemployed youth go to do individual business, and one day can earn 40 yuan. Some retired workers go to do clothing business, and one day can earn 200 yuan. Some go to open a furniture store, and selling a set of furniture can earn 400 yuan net. They build new houses, marry wives, have meat and wine every meal, and some even rent out the entire restaurant to eat. But the miners who go down the pit to dig coal, with a family of several people, have to use that 150-160 yuan a month, and the prices are getting more and more expensive, eggs are 35 cents each, pork is 4 yuan per pound, fish is 4.5 yuan per pound. In this situation, how difficult it is for miners? How difficult it is for the wives of miners? Yet the coal mine still produces coal, and miners still go down the pit, and no one envies the colorful and dazzling Hong Kong Street and Macao Street for a few dollars, and no one is jealous of those rich merchants' one house after another beautiful new residence. They still live under the bridge, still live in the broken houses where the labor reform team used to live, live in the small shacks they have built year after year with broken bricks like swallows...

What good miners they are! But such hard work, such great contributions, only have such low wages, live in such broken houses, what is going on? The Party Committee Secretary of the Mining Bureau, Wu Youzhong, and other responsible comrades all seriously answered this question. "Why? The key is that the relevant policies have led to two deviations in coal production."

"Two deviations?"

"Yes. First, the deviation between value and price. Second, the deviation between production and life."

"What is the deviation between value and price?"

"We are not economists, so we don't need to list a lot of data, but this problem is easy to explain. For example, we now produce one ton of coal, the cost is 41 yuan, while the state-approved price is 36 yuan. This means that for every ton of coal produced more, the mine will lose 5 yuan. Of course, whether it is 36 yuan or 41 yuan, it is not the true value of one ton of coal in today's society. Its true value is: this one ton of coal, when transported to Hefei, is worth 180 yuan, when transported to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it is worth 210 yuan, when transported to Guangdong, it is worth 280 yuan."

"Why is there such a big difference between the price of one ton of coal when it is mined and its actual social value?"

Because there are eighteen toll stations in between. Those who do not mine coal, those officials and private speculators, all make money by issuing invoices. The coal we mine, the price is fixed, anyone who moves a cent is breaking the law, while those speculators, after one transaction, the price increases by dozens of yuan, but it becomes legal! This is what kind of logic? This is simply the strangulation of the coal industry! If this is the case, who will mine coal in the future? Isn't it better for everyone to speculate on coal?

The state does not allow coal prices to rise, but the various things used for mining coal are constantly rising in price: for example, pit timber used to be 80 yuan per cubic meter, now it is 506 yuan. Steel used to be 100 yuan per ton, now it is 900 yuan. Lime used to be 10 cents per piece, now it is 70 cents. Gasoline used to be 1,000 yuan per ton, now it is 1,800 yuan. There are more similar situations. The current trend is: except for coal, the price of everything else used for mining coal is rising. Therefore, the mine now has a saying: "The miners are suffering, the users are suffering, and the speculators are getting rich."

Sunstone, black gold, Prometheus. Burning themselves, lighting up others. But why can't others also burn a little?

What can we do facing this extremely unbalanced economic lever? Thousands of coal mine workers are looking up to us, and we, those countless of us, what should we do? The wheel of fate is still spinning. But how much more can the beautiful and kind hearts of coal mine workers endure? Remember, 70% of our country's energy comes from coal! And now, how much of the unbearable heavy and light burden from themselves and various aspects of society is piled up around our coal mine workers?

As for the deviation between production and life, it is even easier to explain: One ton of coal is 36 yuan, but one pack of Kent cigarettes is 100 yuan. Even one pack of A-Shima cigarettes is 50 yuan. One bottle of Maotai wine is 40 yuan. One bottle of Gujing wine is 80 yuan. This means that one ton of coal cannot be exchanged for one pound of Maotai wine. Two tons of coal can be exchanged for one bottle of Gujing wine. One ton of coal cannot be exchanged for one pack of A-Shima cigarettes. Three tons of coal can be exchanged for one pack of Kent cigarettes. Even if a miner digs 4 tons of coal a day, he himself can only get 5 yuan. In a month, he can only get 150 yuan. And this 150 yuan, compared to his labor, his contribution to the country, and the market prices, what kind of X can be obtained?

Because of this, the more the country's coal is in short supply, the heavier the tasks assigned to the coal mines, the more the coal mines produce coal, the more the coal mines lose money. The more the coal mines lose money, the worse the situation of miners' wages, bonuses, welfare, medical care, sports, culture, education, including employment, housing, and so on, and the worse the situation of these aspects, the worse the situation of coal production, and it may get worse and worse. Should it be solved? How to solve it? That depends on us who are related.

In spring, in autumn, have you seen the dense rows of miners' graves on the hills? In summer, in winter, have you seen the large patches of shacks pressed with bricks on the roofs, crowded with miners? Do you know what they and their spouses, every night, every night, are dreaming of? Do you hear what those old couples, young couples, and those young men and women who are in love, are whispering to each other in the dead of night?

Although the Mining Bureau, in the face of continuous losses, still self-reliantly built 200,000 square meters of simple workers' houses in 1988, but in the face of 400,000 people in the entire mining area, each person only has more than two square meters of living space, and 40,000 people still have no place to live, these 200,000 square meters of workers' houses, how many problems can be solved?

Nowadays, you can hear the song "There is a sun in the sky, there is a moon in the water" everywhere. Miners have no sun, because the sun belongs to the daytime. They should have the moon. But where is the miners' moon? Without coal, what would the world be like? What would life be like? Everyone can imagine that terrifying scene.

Therefore, I appeal: We, and all of us related to this, can try to pick a bright and beautiful moon from the vast night sky for our miners. Because they are the people with the most beautiful silence, burning, dedication, pioneering, exploration, and creation today!

　　今天，谁是最美丽的人？〔报告文学〕        
    ——淮南煤矿巡礼
    当前，美这个字眼，越来越成为人们议论的话题，也几乎成为所有的人追逐的热点。
    尽管各种各样的服装表演使人眼花缭乱，尽管选美活动已成为一种时髦的诱惑，可是，一些不愿浑浑噩噩随波逐流的人，一些有头脑有志向有理想有抱负的人，也越来越感到我们的生活中有一个严肃的问题要认真回答，这就是：在我们这片国土上，美，究竟应该属于谁？在谁都感觉到自己很美的今天，谁又是最美的人呢？
    　　　　他们，他们，他们……
    我家住在黄土高坡，大风从坡上刮过……
    “我觉得，不管在什么地方，不论在什么时候，都应该说：我们的矿工最美！”这话是淮南矿务局局长杨宗震同志说的。
    “杨宗震是一条汉子！”来淮南之前，我就听到这样的评论。到了淮南，更加深了我这方面的印象。“在淮南煤矿的接力赛中，我这一棒一定要跑出速度！”第一次接触老杨，就听他这么说。而当我走过淮南煤矿八个矿井中间的六个之后，我发现杨宗震的这句话，也是千千万万个煤矿工人、包括矿务局党委书记吴友忠在内的广大干部们的心声。不，不仅是心声，而且是实实在在的真实动人的一连串可歌可泣的业迹和故事。
    “应该说：我们的矿工最美！”我渐渐明白，这美，和接力赛，和速度，是完全联系在一起的。随着罐笼徐徐降落，我被送到５００米以下的地层深处。罐笼里潮湿不堪。那轰轰隆隆的响声并不十分悦耳。这是有５８００人的孔集煤矿。巷道里是条泥河，虽然同行的人不停地向我打着招呼，我的两脚还是不断地陷到黑色的泥沼中去。
    “从这条巷道到采煤现场有好几公里，矿工每天上下班大都是走着来走着去。”当我们坐进乘人车的时候，副矿长老魏对我说。“不坐乘人车？”“有时候乘不上。”
    虽然只是几块钢铁，锈渍斑斑，到处湿漉漉的，模糊的灯光下，乘人车却像千里马那么神气。“这是世界上最糟糕的车吧？”想到在阳光下到处乱飞的皇冠、蓝鸟、尼桑、顺风，和最不起眼的波罗莱斯，我一面把权当车门的铁链挂上，一面随口开了句玩笑。采煤队长立刻纠正道：“不能那么说，对我们矿工来说，它是世界上最好的车。”“为什么呢？”“因为它从来不带人去游山逛水，从来不带人去兜风，去享乐，它开来开去，都是为了我们矿工，为了我们挖煤。”顿时，许许多多豪华的宾馆、饭馆、游乐场、舞厅、夜总会从我记忆里一闪而过。乘人车仍轰隆隆地向前开着，没有沙发垫，坐位就是一块溅满泥水的钢板。巷道里下着雨，这里没有四季，看不到红叶飘落，也看不到飞舞的雪花。这里没有一条健美裤，更没有那充满了风感的闪光的长发。乘人车颠得好厉害，我的矿工帽碰到头顶的钢梁上。“当心点，不要碰着。”采煤队长讲话的声音十分柔和，当我那盏矿灯的光照上他的脸时，刹那之间，我的面前才第一次出现了他的特写镜头：低眉敛目，宽厚朴实，胡须几天没有剃过，眼角布有过早的皱纹。好像怕羞似的，他说话时很少和我对视。尽管这样，我却发现，他黝黑的眼睛深处，蕴藏着一种看不见的燃烧，一种看不见的辉煌，一种能，一种像煤一样的神态。“你怎么选择了采煤这职业？”他笑了笑，眼睛仍旧不望着我，可是我敢肯定，他的笑容不比任何人差。“我是下放农村招工上来的。”“几年了？”“十几年了。”“结婚了吗？”“结婚了。还有一个小孩。”“你喜欢采煤这一行吗？”“不能说喜欢，也不能说不喜欢。国家建设需要煤，煤总是要有人采。”
    在乘人车停下的一刹那间，他从车门口站起来，阑珊的灯火中，蓦然回首，我忽然发现他的眼神里充满了某种魅力。那是一种黑色的魅力。黑色的诱惑，像煤一样，深深地埋藏着，又默默地包蕴着。
    “应该说：我们的矿工最美！”杨宗震同志的话，犹如雷声从我的胸膛上滚过。
    ……不管是东南风还是西北风，都是我的歌，我的歌……
    雨下着，那当然是一种巷道里的雨，雨点落进衣领，使人想起了现在正是梅花盛开的季节。在太湖边上，在西湖边上，在梅园，在邓尉，金黄霓红的粉雾中，正有多少情侣翩翩而过？可这里没有梅花，只有矿灯在闪灼。在这巷道一侧，一片黑色的泥泞中，矿工们正在用餐。他们有的蹲着，有的站着，有的干脆坐在泥水里。他们身上是脏的，脸上是黑的。有的人甚至脱去了褂子，赤裸着上身，当然，他们的身上也是黑的。他们每人都端着一个饭盒。他们也时而交谈几句。他们是会说话的巴黎公社社员墙。沉默了很久很久的国际歌突然从我胸中响起。
    他们蹲在水里，坐在泥里，一口凉饭，一口冷水，为了什么？为了那一个月１００多元钱吗？不，贩鸡，贩鱼，贩青菜，贩萝卜，在这个矿工群居的地方，一天最少也能挣上１０块钱，一个月稍微动动，３００块就能轻轻巧巧装进腰包，他们为什么要在这又脏又苦的地方卖命呢？“为什么？不就是为了煤嘛！”他们的回答一点深度也没有，也没有什么更多的逻辑，措辞也不那么漂亮，几乎没有什么豪言壮语。他们也有父母，也有老婆孩子。他们知道，这里没有黄金，没有白银，没有乌纱帽，没有荣誉，没有异国风情。有的却是惊人的艰苦，随时都有可能发生的生命危险以及永远也不会结束的父母的牵肠挂肚的担心和妻子那永远也不会醒来的恶梦。“采煤工作你不干，他不干，井下的煤谁去采呢？”采煤工袁胜利的话，也许能够回答这个问题。
    ……山下有棵大树，山上有棵小树……
    我们已经来到巷道的尽头，正不知向何处去的时候，采煤队长弯腰打开了巷道一侧的盖子。“我们就从这里往上爬。”魏副矿长用一种书生的目光打量我，那眼神仿佛是说：“能行吗？”
    我跟着魏副矿长从洞口钻了进去。这洞是一条时髦的牛仔裤，不大不小，刚好把你的身子裹紧。面前，时而直上直下时而向内倾斜的煤壁上，是一尺长的钢筋做成的梯子，上的时候，上面用双手抓住，下面用两脚踩住。由于每天有三班工人从这里上下，所以每一截钢筋都是湿漉漉滑溜溜的。我在洞里直起腰向上一看，看不见出口在什么地方，只见一串灰蒙蒙的灯光。洞直上直下。自古华山一条路。我紧跟着他向上爬去。此时此刻，不知为什么，我忽然想起了但丁在《神曲》里描写的某些情景。“两手抓牢啊！”有人不断地在下面呼叫。越往上爬，越感到上不见天，下不着地。我渐渐感到，我的内衣已经潮透了，下井时换上的那件棉背心也潮透了，汗，像雨水一样，顺着我的面颊向下滚流。“这洞有多深啊？”“四十米。”我在心里盘算着：４０米，１２０尺。将近１０层楼那么高。“你去爬一次，写起文章来，肯定会妙笔生花！”我的心际，忽然又响起了杨宗震同志的笑声，我不断地向上攀登着。但这不是在登庐山，也不是在游龙宫洞。这里虽然也风光奇绝，但大人先生们是不会光临的。这块宝地，这座宝山，这个宝洞，不是什么旅游胜地。它只属于杨宗震和他的矿工们。
    “真讨厌，又停电了！”电视机关闭了。收录机不响了。霓虹灯不亮了。可是你知不知道电是从哪里来的？发电要煤，煤又是从哪里来的呢？
    ……当夕阳西下的时候……
    这里没有夕阳。当矿工伸手把我从洞口拉出来的时候，一刹那间，我感到我的身子几乎和地球一样重。“歇一会吧，下面还要钻另一个洞。”我们坐到鹿寨上。不远处有一个矿工。他身上一片漆黑。几乎没穿什么。“辛苦了？”他向我看看。“习惯了，就那么回事。”我久久地注视着他，他的目光是那么严峻，那么单纯。这使我非常吃惊。不知为什么，一时之间，我觉得我已经离开了凡界。那里的目光所透露的世俗的纷扰我是熟悉的。可是这里只有赤裸裸的心，只有被煤灰包裹着的他，那么憨憨地站着。没有邪念。没有贪欲。没有任何的雕饰。没有任何的化妆。人家知道他的名字和不知道他的名字他都无所谓。他不计较高低上下，不讲求座次排位。但他却在做着最伟大的工作。把光和能，热和力，送给祖国，送给人民。而他自己，只是一块煤，一块普普通通的煤。
    　　　　他们，他们，他们……
    矿井里是他们，在地面上还是他们。
    一个挖了一辈子煤现已退休的老矿工在矿长面前祈求着：“矿长，给我一间房子吧！”我的泪立刻奔眶而出。顷刻之间，我感到一阵天旋地转。无数条巷道。无数个黑漆漆的洞口。无数次的上井，下井，无数次的攀登、滚爬。无数次的煤灰煤屑满鼻子、满口、满脸、满身。无数次的凉饭冷茶。无数次的起早摸黑。无数次的牵肠挂肚。无数次闹钟的猛然震响。无数次的老母的叮嘱，妻子的期盼。无数次的煤车隆隆开过，煤河哗哗奔流。无数次的花开花落。无数次的春去冬来。无数次的昨夜星辰。无数次的今宵灯火、岁月、生活、罐笼、风镐。３０年，一切都一片缭乱。只有煤为他书写两个山样的大字：矿工。
    “这里的住房情况怎么样？”矿长的回答是一丝苦笑。“别的矿的情况呢？”“也差不多。”“不对，我前几年到谢一矿来过。那里有一排一排的宿舍楼，单身矿工宿舍旅馆化。还有相当漂亮的幼儿园……”“你说的都是事实，不过那都是花墙外面的情况。”
    “咱们到二道河去看看吧。”魏副矿长把行政科长找来。“你问二道河？那是五八年修淮堤时劳改队住的房子，现在给矿工住着。”“什么？劳改队？”“……”所有的主人都不再回答我的问话，这时我注意到矿长的眼圈第一次红了。
    　　　　我家住在黄土高坡，大风从坡上刮过……
    “先说说矿长副矿长吧。”行政科长的脸上一点笑容也没有。“不要说我们。”“怎么能不说呢？矿长副矿长的办公室都搭一张小床，一年到头，离家再近，他们也难得回去一次。就是过年，也很少回家。”“不谈这些，不谈这些！”魏副矿长打断了行政科长的话。“那好，那就介绍采煤工吧：王建棠，挖了１１年煤。”
    二道河到了。我们下了车。这里全是没脚的泥泞。现在是冬天。可以想像到这里的夏天是个什么样子。我们推开一扇门走了进去。一个小孩正扒在床沿上哭。女主人买菜去了。竹笆隔的墙。没有窗户。床上铺着蒲包。饭桌上放着一碗吃剩的豆腐。男主人大概刚下早班，眼角布满红丝。“你叫什么名字？”我所遇到的矿工都是一样地憨厚老实。天下的好人怎么都跑来挖煤了呢？“梁昌爱。”他没有我平常看到的那许多人的那种眼神。他虽然混的不怎么样，但心里的那泓泉水是清澈的，不像他门前的路那么多泥泞。他３０多岁。不多话。你问到什么他答什么。“做什么活？”“在井下，当运输工人。”他本来是站在那里的，忽然之间，像想起了什么，跑到床边上，摸来一包纸烟，这里的人都把这种烟叫“大团结”，这是矿工抽的烟，五毛二分钱一包。他把烟一支一支拿出来，双手送到我们面前。我在井下也许见到过他。不过他那时候满脸都是煤灰。“几口人？”“四口。两个小孩。”“父亲呢？”“也是挖煤的，干了２１年，现在退休了。”“你干了多少年了？”“１１年了。”“工资？”“每个月１５０元。”我看到，他这间房子有的地方在漏雨。虽然经过修修堵堵，可毕竟是千孔百疮了。他见了我们，包括见了他们的矿长、队长，一句牢骚都没有，一句怨言都没有，好像挖煤和住这样的地方，都是自己的天职。
    斜对面的院子里，是井下电工张同华的家。他五八年下矿，在矿上干了２０年，现在退休了，月工资８０元，住着两间歪歪倒倒的破房子。大儿子张军，已经接了他的班，在井下干开拓工，已经干了４年，大概刚结婚不久，我们进门的时候，年轻的媳妇正在给怀里的孩子喂奶，身上穿的还像一个新娘子。而干了２０年矿工的张同华却只穿着一件薄薄的已经补过的小棉袄，腰里扎着一条破布带子。“日子过得怎么样？”“这不是，不干了，每月还给８０元，国家有困难，我们不能要求过高。”“你在井下干了２０年，你儿子又接着干，不怕苦吗？”“苦？俺这是干一行爱一行。那不，我小儿子想干还干不上呢！”站在旁边的张军，大高个子，这时甜甜地笑了。他觉得自己当一个井下开拓工，每月挣９０块钱，比起弟弟来，已经是够值得骄傲的了。而他弟弟，不过是石灰窑上的临时工。别的什么都没有，干一天得一元二毛五分钱。
    “你住哪？”“我？有地方。”他伸手向院子对面指了指。那是一间用牛毛毡盖顶碎砖压脚的５米见方的小屋。门只到我的胸口。我推门进去。屋顶直碰我的头，我无法直起腰来。整个屋子，全给一张破床占去了。他的老伴，那和他风风雨雨过了大半生的妻子正生病躺在床上。屋顶上的雨水，正滴滴嗒嗒地滴在她床上。她用一块塑料布遮在被子上。雨水，就是这样顺着塑料布的边沿，又流到床前的地上，在那里聚成了一个小小的水潭。
    看到井上这一切，又想到井下那一切，我只能使劲地抑制住我两眼的泪水。
    ……山下有棵大树，山上有棵小树……
    到潘一矿的那天，天上飘起了小雪。这是今年的第一场雪。１９８７年１２月９日，这个矿曾发生过一次瓦斯爆炸事故。
    当然，面对那么惊人的噩耗，亲人的惊慌失措与痛苦万状，是可以想见的。但矿工呢？矿工还是矿工！综采一区工人杨井宽，事故发生后，亲属把他找回家，妻子哭着求他今后不管干什么，也别再干矿工了，他却耐心说服了妻子，重新回到了井下。掘进一区工人马胜利，事故发生后，他母亲和他妻子连夜从谢一矿赶来，硬是哭着把他拖回家，锁到屋子里。可是，母亲和妻子一离身，他就从窗户里跳出来，很快又回到了井下。掘进三区工人共产党员黄炳成，事故发生时，受到爆炸冲击波的冲击，脚被摔伤，虽然在死亡线上幸免于难，但他临危不惧，忍着伤痛，积极参加抢险，没有请假，没有休班。综采二区工人共产党员郭天军，发烧请了病假，一听说出了事故，坚持带病上班，领导问他为何不在家休息？他说：“矿上出了事，生产人手少，我是共产党员，在这个时候应当挺身而出！”
    “应该说：我们的矿工最美！”随着深入的调查访问，我越体会到杨宗震同志的这句话的真实份量和深刻含意！
    到潘集一矿一下车，就看到矿办公室门口醒目地张贴着省委书记卢荣璟元月四日发来的贺电。卢荣璟同志是得知瓦斯爆炸事故后部分职工思想不太稳定的情况下特地赶来看望全矿的职工的。省委书记的亲切关怀，使全矿职工受到了极大鼓舞。１９８８年，潘一矿的生产情况比任何一年都好，超额完成了国家规定的出煤任务。卢荣璟同志的贺电，就是为此而发的。
    一个省委书记给一个煤矿直接发贺电，这还是不多见的。一个领导干部不是单靠在上面发号施令，而是亲自到下面去，运用自己的精神力量，去影响调动一大批人的积极性，在当前，无疑是一项值得重视的领导艺术。
    有勇敢的将军，才会有英雄的士兵。潘一矿的胜利和杨宗震那一班人的努力分不开的。为了赶时间抢进度，作为一矿之长的杨宗震常常分秒不肯放过。就因为如此，他在１９８８年一年里就遇上两次车祸。第一次是７月２６日，他从山东龙口开完会，顾不得欣赏海滨盛夏那迷人的风光，一刻不停，一定要连夜赶回淮南。连夜开车，又是快速度，超车的时候，车子落到了桥下。他摔断了六根肋骨，全身有七个断裂点，从车窗里爬出来，硬是立直身子步行几华里赶到附近的县医院去。回到淮南，住进医院，他也没有一天在床上睡平过。他的病房就是会议室，会客室，在这里主持会议，听取来自各方面的汇报，接待各种各样的来访。双手扶头，忍受着全身那剧烈的疼痛。整个一个夏天，他都是这样撑过来的。想不到七个断裂，靠自身的生命力接合痊愈，他又是一条站得直的汉子时，１月２７日，为了赶到镇江开会，他第二次遇上车祸。额头被撞破了，到医院逢了六针。
    连续两次车祸，他的司机哭了。可他还和平时一样，镇定而紧张地工作着。
    　　　　我们，我们，我们……
    雪后的煤城，显得特别静谧。不过，面对这刚刚经过初雪装点的良宵，我的脑子里却一直想着那将近十层桥高的矿工通道，想到那潮湿的又陡又险的通道，又不知有多少工人从上面攀登过。我想到乘人车，想到矿工们蹲在泥潭里享用又冷又简单的工作午餐，想到他们的牺牲，他们在风雪里的奔波，想到他们那一处一处简陋的住房，想到他们已经走完的一生和正在走着的一生。而同时，我也想到了我们，想到了许许多多的我们。
    ……井下作业如此艰险，是什么力量在支持着我们的采煤工人呢？
    ……虽然是煤城，这里却照样有香港街和澳门街，有的待业青年去干个体户，光彩扩一项一天就赚４０元。有的退休工人去做服装生意，一天就赚２００元。有的去开家具店，卖一套组合家具净赚４００元。他们盖起了新房，娶到了老婆，每餐酒肉不断，有的甚至把整座餐馆包下来吃。可下井挖煤的工人，一家几口，每个月都要在那一百五六十块里派用场，而且物价越来越贵，鸡蛋３角５分一个，猪肉４元１斤，鱼４．５元１斤。在这种情况下，矿工该是多么艰难？矿工的妻子又该是多么艰难？可是煤矿照样出煤，矿工照常下井，并没有人羡慕那香港街澳门街上的花花绿绿，为了几个钱去弃工经商，并没有眼馋那些腰缠万贯的倒爷们的一处又一处漂亮的新居。他们还住在大桥下面，还住在劳改队住过的破工房里，住在自己拾碎砖头像燕子垒窝那样长年累月搭起的小窝棚里……
    多么好的矿工啊！可是那么苦的工作，那么大的贡献，却只有那么少的工资，住那么破的住房，这到底是怎么回事？矿务局的党委书记吴友忠同志和其他负责同志都认真地回答了这个问题。“为什么？关键在于有关的政策导致煤炭生产出现了两个背离”。
    “两个背离？”
    “是的。首先是价值和价格的背离。其次是生产和生活的背离。”
    “什么叫价值和价格的背离？”
    “我们不是经济学家，因而也用不着罗列许多数据，但这个问题很容易说清楚，比方说，我们现在生产１吨煤，成本费要４１元，而国家规定的价格是３６元。这就是说，工人多生产１吨煤，矿上就要多赔５元。当然，不管是３６元或４１元，都不是目前社会上１吨煤真正的价值。它的真正价值是：这同１吨煤，运到合肥就是１８０元，运到江浙就是２１０元，运到广东就要２８０元。”
    “为什么１吨煤的出矿价格与它实际上的社会价值相差这么大呢？”
    因为这中间有十八道关口倒把。那些不挖煤的人，那官倒爷，私倒爷，全靠开票发财致富。我们挖出的煤，价格是铁板钉钉子，谁动一分都犯法，而那些倒爷们，一过手就涨几十块，却成了合法的！这不知是什么逻辑？这简直是对煤炭事业的扼杀！如果这样，将来谁还挖煤？大家都去倒煤不是更好吗？
    国家不准煤涨价，可采煤用的一系列东西，却又在不断地涨价：比方说，坑木过去８０元一方，现在是５０６元。钢材过去１００元一吨，现在９００元。片石原来是１毛一块，现在是７角。汽油过去是１０００元一吨，现在是１８００元。类似的情况，还有更多。目前的趋势是：除了煤不涨价外，挖煤用的其它东西都在涨价。为此，矿上现在流传着这么一句顺口溜：“苦了挖煤的，坑了用煤的，富了倒煤的。”
    太阳石，乌金，普罗米修士。燃烧了自己，照亮了别人。可别人为什么就不能同样地燃烧一下呢？
    我们面对着这极不平衡的经济杠杆能做些什么呢？煤矿成千上万的职工正翘首望着我们，而我们，那些许许多多的我们，又应该怎么办呢？目前那天轮还在旋转着。可是煤矿工人那颗善良美丽的心，究竟还有多大的承受力？要知道，我国的能源７０％是来自煤炭啊！而目前，堆积在我们煤矿工人周围的，来自自身和来自社会各个方面的不能承受之重和不能承受之轻又有多少呢？
    至于生产和生活背离就更容易解释清楚：１吨煤３６元，可是一条键牌香烟却要１００元。就是１条阿诗玛香烟也要５０元。而一瓶口子酒要４０元。１瓶古井酒要８０元。这么说，１吨煤换不到１斤口子酒。两吨煤换一瓶古井酒。１吨煤换不到一条阿诗玛香烟。３吨煤才能换一条键牌香烟。就算矿工每天挖４吨煤，而他自己，却只能拿到５元钱。一个月，也只能拿到１５０元钱。而他这１５０元钱，和他的劳动量相比，和他对国家的贡献相比，和市场的物价相比，又能得出什么样的Ｘ呢？
    就因为如此，国家的煤炭越是告急，下达给煤矿的任务就越重，煤矿出煤越超额，煤矿也就越发亏本。煤矿越亏本，矿工的工资、奖金、福利、医疗、体育、文化、教育，包括就业、住房等等方面的现状，也就不可能改善，而这许许多多方面的情况不能得到改善，煤炭生产的势头也就不会越来越好，而很可能越来越不好，这是一个恶性循环。应不应该解决？如何解决？那就只有看有关的我们了。
    在春天，在秋天，你看到过山坡上那密密麻麻排列着的矿工的坟墓吗？在夏天，在冬天，你看到过矿区里那一大片一大片用砖头压着顶棚的人满为患的矿工住的棚屋吗？你知道他们和她们，每夜每夜在做些什么梦吗？你听到那些老年夫妇，青年夫妇，以及那些正在相爱着的少男少女，更深人静时正在窃窃私语些什么吗？
    虽然矿务局在连年亏损的情况下，１９８８年还自力更生，多方设法为矿工建了２０万平方米简易工房。可是，在全矿区４０万人每人平均只有两平方米多住房，有４万人尚无房可住的情况下，这２０万平方米工房，又能解决多少问题？
    现在到处都可以听到“天上有个太阳，水中有个月亮”的歌曲。矿工是没有太阳的，因为太阳属于白昼。他们理应拥有月亮。可是，矿工的月亮在哪里呢？没有煤，世界会是个什么样子？生活会是个什么样子？谁都能想像出那个可怖的景象来。
    因此，我呼吁：我们，以及与此有关的所有的我们，能够设法从那浩瀚的夜的天幕上，为我们的矿工摘下一轮光辉皎洁的月亮。因为，他们是具有沉默之美、燃烧之美、奉献之美、开拓之美、探索和创造之美的今天最美丽的人！
