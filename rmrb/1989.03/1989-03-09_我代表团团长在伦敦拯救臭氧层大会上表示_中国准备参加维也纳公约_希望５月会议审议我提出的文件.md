Chinese delegation leader Liu Mingpuo stated at the London Ozone Layer Protection Conference discussion meeting today that the Chinese government supports the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and is prepared to join the Vienna Convention. He also expressed the hope that the document submitted by China will be reviewed at the May meeting in Helsinki.

The People's Daily, London, March 6 - Reporter Chen Te'an reports: Chinese delegation leader Liu Mingpuo today, at the London Ozone Layer Protection Conference discussion meeting, stated that the Chinese government supports the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, and is prepared to join the Vienna Convention. He is willing to seek a fair and mutually acceptable way to participate in the Protocol within the framework proposed by the Protocol.

He emphasized China's stance and attitude towards the Montreal Protocol.

He said, "We believe that the Protocol will play a certain role in controlling and reducing substances that deplete the ozone layer. However, the Protocol also contains some unfair elements, mainly that it does not fully reflect the principle of 'polluter pays.' The Protocol's regulations on the control and reduction of baseline chlorofluorocarbons will affect the economic development of developing countries. Therefore, we solemnly suggest that some adjustments or more flexible understandings be made to the Protocol's regulations on control baselines to adapt to the actual situation and special needs of developing countries. This will help to achieve the purposes and principles of the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol."

He said, "Given that the Chinese government supports the purposes and principles of the Vienna Convention and the Montreal Protocol, we are willing to seek a fair and mutually acceptable way to participate in the Protocol within the framework provided by the Protocol. To this end, we have submitted a document and hope that it will be reviewed and agreed upon at the first meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in Helsinki in May."

　　我代表团团长在伦敦拯救臭氧层大会上表示
    中国准备参加维也纳公约
    希望５月会议审议我提出的文件
    本报伦敦３月６日电  记者陈特安报道：中国代表团团长刘明璞今天在伦敦拯救臭氧层大会讨论会上发言表示，中国政府支持保护臭氧层的维也纳公约和关于消耗臭氧层物质的蒙特利尔议定书的宗旨和原则，准备参加维也纳公约，愿意在议定书提出的框架内，寻求以公平的、各方可以接受的方式参加议定书的途径。
    他着重就蒙特利尔议定书阐明了中国政府的立场和态度。
    他说，我们认为它在控制和减少消耗臭氧层的物质方面将起到一定的作用。但是该议定书也存在一些不公平的成分，主要是没有充分体现“多排放、多削减”这一公平原则。议定书关于氯氟烃类物质的控制和削减基准的规定将影响发展中国家的经济发展。所以，我们郑重地建议，对议定书中关于控制基准的规定作一些适应发展中国家现实情况和特别需要的变通安排或作出比较灵活的谅解，这将有助于实现维也纳公约和蒙特利尔议定书的宗旨和原则。
    他说，鉴于中国政府支持维也纳公约和蒙特利尔议定书的宗旨和原则，我们愿意在议定书所提供的框架之内，寻求以公平的、各方可以接受的方式参加议定书的途径。为此，我们提供了一份文件，希望能在５月份赫尔辛基蒙特利尔议定书缔约国第一次会议上审议并达成协议。
