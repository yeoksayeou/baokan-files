Title: A Distinctive Biography of Lu Xun
Author: Ma Ti Ji
Date: 1989-03-22
Edition: 8

Since the early 1980s, numerous biographies of Lu Xun have been published. Within a span of three to four years, at least six to seven biographies of Lu Xun were published domestically alone. Recently, the Liaoning University Press published "Breaking Through and Surpassing – On Lu Xun and His Contemporaries" by Peng Ding'an, which is a unique and insightful biography of Lu Xun.

Marx and Engels stated in "The German Ideology": "The development of an individual depends on the development of all other individuals with whom he is directly or indirectly in contact." Lu Xun's development is a testament to this principle; he grew and developed alongside his contemporaries. "Breaking Through and Surpassing" adheres to this theme, using Lu Xun's personal life and activities as the central axis, and examines him as a product of his time and a pride of the era. The author divides Lu Xun's life into three periods: the Xinhai Revolution, the May Fourth Movement, and the League of Left-Wing Writers. From these periods, the author selects 25 individuals who had a close relationship with Lu Xun's growth and development, conducting comparative studies on their interactions, and presenting the image of Lu Xun, the soul of the nation.

We can observe how Lu Xun absorbed democratic thoughts from revolutionary pioneers like Zhang Taiyan and Sun Yat-sen, and how he was inspired and motivated by the leaders of the New Culture Movement, such as Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu, to break free from the gloomy confines of his study and join the forefront of the New Culture Movement, surpassing the limitations of his predecessors and peers. From Lu Xun's interactions with Roushi and Yin Fu, we can see how he nurtured young literary talents with maternal love, while also absorbing progressive thoughts and revolutionary spirits from his younger comrades, continually renewing his own thoughts and knowledge. From Lu Xun's personal relationships with Zhu An and Xu Guangping, we can see that he was not only a great thinker, revolutionary, and writer but also a man of flesh and blood, with emotions, desires, love, and pain. The author delves seriously into Lu Xun's private life, expressing deep sympathy for Zhu An, a victim of feudal ethics who harbored a hopeless love throughout her life, and offering fervent praise for Xu Guangping, Lu Xun's loyal student, comrade, and companion, who shone like the moon without competing with the sun. This contrasts sharply with many Lu Xun biographies that focus solely on his public life, neglecting or deliberately avoiding his private life.

The 25 contemporaries chosen by the author are broadly representative, encompassing figures from various strata of the political, literary, and cultural spheres. Through Lu Xun's interactions with these individuals, we can glimpse the development trajectory of modern Chinese revolutionary history, cultural history, and literary movements. From Lu Xun's interactions with Chen Duxiu, Qian Xuancong, and Liu Bannong, the author paints a grand and tumultuous picture of the May Fourth New Culture Movement. From the complex relationship between Lu Xun, Hu Shi, and Zhou Zuoren—initially allies, later diverging, and ultimately reconciling—the reader can clearly see the historical phenomenon of modern Chinese culture developing from unity to diversity. From Lu Xun's "shared communist aspirations" with Qu Qiubai and Feng Xuefeng, one can trace the line of communist thought and culture in modern Chinese society and people's revolution, from its germination and struggle to its development, as well as the arduous journey of Lu Xun's thoughts and the left-wing literary movement.

The author of "Breaking Through and Surpassing" corrects certain blind and unhistorical evaluations of Hu Shi and Zhou Zuoren in academia, pointing out: "It is incorrect to deny Hu Shi and Zhou Zuoren's contributions to the May Fourth New Culture Movement, but it is equally incorrect to claim that 'Hu and Zhou are entirely good, and Lu Xun's criticisms and struggles at that time were all wrong, at least unnecessary, excessive, or personal disputes.'" The author metaphorically refers to such unanalyzed revisionist articles as "flipping pancakes." This independent perspective, uninfluenced by popular opinions, is also commendable.

### 颇具风采的鲁迅别传——读《突破与超越》

　　颇具风采的鲁迅别传        
    ——读《突破与超越》
    马蹄疾
    从八十年代初起，鲁迅传记作品竞相问世，在三四年的时间里，仅国内出版的鲁迅传记就有六七部之多。最近由辽宁大学出版社出版的彭定安的《突破与超越——论鲁迅和他的同时代人》，是一部独具匠心的鲁迅别传。
    马克思、恩格斯在《德意志意识形态》中指出：“一个人的发展取决于和他直接或间接进行交往的其他一切人的发展。”鲁迅的发展正是如此，他和他的同时代人一同发展，一起成长。《突破与超越》紧紧围绕这个主旨，以鲁迅个人生平活动为轴心，把鲁迅作为一个历史的产儿，时代的骄子，来进行考察研究，作者把鲁迅按活动时序分成辛亥革命、五四运动、左联三个时期，从这三个时期中筛选与鲁迅生长和发展有着密切关系的２５人，进行相互间的交往研究和比较研究，展现了鲁迅这位民族之魂的形象。我们可能以从鲁迅与章太炎、孙中山的交往关系中，看到他怎样从革命的先行者身上吸取思想营养而受到民主主义思想的启蒙；从鲁迅与李大钊、陈独秀的交往关系中，看到他如何在新文化运动的前驱将领们的催化和鼓舞下，冲出苦闷而阴冷的书屋，奔向新文化运动的前列，突破先辈和平辈们的某些局限而超越他们；我们从鲁迅与柔石、殷夫的交往关系中，可以看到他怎样以慈母般的爱，把自己的乳汗哺育文学新人的成长，同时从后辈战士身上，接受他们进步的思想和革命的精神，使自己的思想和知识不断更新；从鲁迅与朱安、许广平的爱情、婚姻、家庭的“儿女私情”中，可以看到他不仅是一位伟大的思想家、革命家和文学家，也是一位有血、有肉、有情、有欲、有爱、有痛的食人间烟火的活的鲁迅。作者对鲁迅的私生活作了严肃认真的探讨，对封建礼教的牺牲者，终生“怀着无望的爱”的鲁迅前夫人朱安女士给予深沉的同情，对“明月照人而不与太阳争辉”的鲁迅的忠实的学生、战友和伴侣许广平，给予热烈的颂扬，这与许多鲁迅传记，只写鲁迅战斗的一面，忽略或有意回避鲁迅私生活的一面，是一个明显的对比。
    作者所选择的２５位同时代人具有广泛的代表性，这里有政治思想界、文学艺术界、文化艺术界各阶层的代表人物，从鲁迅和这些人物的交往中，可以窥见中国现代革命史、文化史和文学运动史的发展轨迹。从鲁迅与陈独秀、钱玄同、刘半农的交往关系中，作者描绘出一幅波澜壮阔、风起云涌的五四新文化运动的壮丽画卷；从鲁迅与胡适、周作人的始同途，后分道，终殊归的奇妙的关系嬗变中，使读者清楚地看到中国现代文化发展由组合到分化的历史现象；从鲁迅与瞿秋白、冯雪峰的“共产同怀”的关系中，可以看见一条共产主义思想文化在我国现代社会和人民革命的过程中萌芽、奋斗、受挫、挣扎、发展的路线，以及鲁迅思想的轨迹和左翼文艺运动发展的艰难历程……
    《突破与超越》的作者，针对学术界对胡适和周作人的某些盲目的、不加历史分析的评价作了辨正，指出：否定胡适、周作人在五四新文化运动中的功绩当然不对，但倘认为“胡、周一切皆好，而鲁迅当年的批判和斗争，都是错误的，至少是多余的，是过分的或个人意气之争”，同样“也是违背历史真实的”。作者把这种不加分析的翻案文章，形象地比喻作翻“烧饼”。这种不为世见俗说所左右的独立见解，也是值得提倡的。
