There is a saying, “The old hen turns into a duck in the blink of an eye,” which is an exclamation of how quickly things change. In reality, an old hen turning into a duck can probably only be seen in a magic show. However, similar things happen everywhere.

Example one: “B-ultrasound” has become the “fortune-teller” for some pregnant women in rural areas. In some places, people ask doctors to use “B-ultrasound” to determine whether a pregnant woman is carrying a male or female fetus. If it is a female fetus, even if it is eight months along, they will have an abortion.

Example two: Marriage certificates have become “housing certificates” and “passports” for going abroad. Some people rush into marriage to get an extra ten square meters of housing; others hastily register for marriage to obtain the qualification to accompany someone abroad… Once the goal is achieved, they quickly file for divorce.

One thing’s proper function is not utilized, while an improper function is exaggerated, causing the thing to lose its original appearance and purpose, gradually becoming distorted and losing its original meaning. Such things happen all around us: even advanced things like computers are used for fortune-telling; important things like going abroad for a study tour are used to buy a few “big items” for oneself; good methods like optimization and combination are used to find excuses to place friends and relatives. More than 60 years ago, Mr. Lu Xun sighed about the “national character”: “Who says the Chinese people are not good at changing? Every new thing that comes in, although initially resisted, once seen as reliable, will naturally change. However, it is not changing oneself to fit the new thing, but changing the new thing to fit oneself.” This is truly profound!

Implementing reform and opening up is about changing to more advanced aspects and eliminating the backward ones. However, the kind of change where an “old hen turns into a duck” is using the backward to reform the advanced, twisting good things into bad. For this stubborn “national character,” we should also invest a lot of effort to reform it.

### “老母鸡变鸭”

　　“老母鸡变鸭”
     刘绍楹
    有句俗话，“眼睛一眨，老母鸡变鸭”，是对事物变化之快的感叹。真的老母鸡变鸭，大概只能在玩魔术的地方才能看到。可是，与此类似的事，却到处都有。
    例一：“Ｂ超”成了农村一些孕妇的“相命先生”。一些地方，有些人求医生用“Ｂ超”诊断孕妇怀的是男胎还是女胎。如果是女胎，就是已怀了八个月的也要堕掉。
    例二：结婚证成了“要房证”、出国“通行证”。有人为了多分十几平方米房子“突击结婚”；有人为取得出国伴读资格匆忙登记……目的达到后，很快又办离婚手续。
    一事物正当的功能得不到发挥，而不应当具有的功能却又中了邪似地拚命发展，使事物丧失本来面目和作用，逐渐走样、变味儿，这样的事在我们周围还有许多：先进如电子计算机，有人拿它测字算命；重要如出国考察，有人借此为自家买几“大件”；好办法如优化组合，有人又可以找到安插亲朋好友的借口。鲁迅先生６０多年前对“国民性”作过一番感叹：“谁说中国人不善于改变呢？每一新的事物进来，起初虽然排斥，但看到有些可靠，就自然会改变。不过并非将自己变得合于新事物，乃是将新事物变得合于自己而已。”真是入木三分啊！
    实行改革开放，是向先进的方面变化，剔除落后面。那种“老母鸡变鸭”式的变化，却是用落后改造先进，把好经念歪了。对于这种顽固的“国民性”，也该花大气力改造一下了。
