Title: Reflections on Reading "Scattered Poems by Nie Yi Sheng"
Author: Lü Jiàn
Date: 1989-03-28
Edition: 8

This book was a gift from Nie Yi Sheng, and I have read it repeatedly over three days. It is a collection of classical poetry, including "Northern Wasteland Poems," "Poems of Reciprocal Gifts," and "Southern Mountain Poems," collectively known as the "Three Poems," along with a "Fourth Collection." The cover features a title by Jing Wen (Zhong Jingwen). The high artistic achievement of the author's poetry has already been praised by many. I have not deeply studied classical poetry, so I dare not make any judgments. However, the author's preface to this collection, written in the style of an essay, I find to be an excellent article that is worth reading.

When discussing his experience of writing poetry, he says: "Everything in the labor site of the Northern Wasteland was unfamiliar to me, and thus it was all new. Despite my daily exhaustion, sometimes even complaining about the heavens and the earth, these new things were many that I wanted to write or could write." Having life, having genuine feelings about life, wanting to write and being able to write—these words are so sincere. Without this, one cannot write poetry. When talking about classical poetry, he says: "I believe that classical poetry is suitable for expressing certain emotions. Over the past 20 years, I have had these kinds of emotions, so I wrote poetry; sometimes the poetry forms on its own, without me writing it, that's all." This insight truly captures the essence of writing poetry. I recall a writer saying, "Inspiration almost always comes from the heart." Zhao Yuanbei praised Su Dongpo's poetry for its natural flow, and Qing Dynasty poet Jiang Zhuo wrote, "If I seek poetry, I am foolish; if poetry seeks me, I cannot refuse." These all seem to convey the same idea. Poetry comes from being moved by external things and then being compelled to express it from within; it cannot lack the strong interaction between the inner and outer self. When I read Nie Yi Sheng's words, I couldn't help but exclaim, "Marvelous! Marvelous!" In fact, we often have such experiences, but we have not been able to express them in such seemingly ordinary language. Nie Yi Sheng, truly a poet.

We often say "writing poetry" to represent a creative process. In reality, poetry is indeed something that forms on its own. Of course, this does not mean that the poet is merely an objective recorder. No, the phrase "poetry sometimes forms on its own" is precisely the "formation of the poet." When a poet is moved by people, events, or things, a certain emotion (and thus a certain thought or inclination) arises in their heart, and when it reaches a saturation point, the poetic lines naturally gush out, just like how people cry when overwhelmed with emotion, laugh when overly joyful, and tears flow uncontrollably. Sometimes, poets, in their eagerness to write down their lines, even find their hands shaking, their bodies cold. Of course, poets must create conditions in life to promote the brewing of such emotions. This process is very important. If there is no such process, or if it is not frequently created, poetic inspiration may be interrupted or dried up, and even if one tries to write, it would only be forced, and good poetry would not appear. Of course, this is only one aspect; poetry requires many conditions.

Why is it that some commissioned poems, poems of courtesy, or poems for festivals today, rarely produce good poetry? The reason can be inferred. "Poetry on command" means that the poet himself does not have any emotional involvement, especially not genuine excitement, so how can he move or excite his readers?

There is another point he discusses that is quite interesting. He says he does not understand how to write poetry, "Even now, I still do not completely believe that the poetry I write is truly poetry, nor do I understand the good and bad of others' poetry, or to what extent it is good or bad." In Nie Yi Sheng, this is somewhat self-deprecating, but to me, it resonates deeply, as if it were said just for me. To be clear and self-aware, how difficult it is!

### 《散宜生诗》读后

　　《散宜生诗》读后
    此册为聂翁见赠，反复读之，一连三日。
    这是一册旧体诗，包括《北荒草》、《赠答草》、《南山草》即“三草”及《第四草》，共四辑。封面为静闻（钟敬文）题签。作者诗格之高，达到的艺术造诣，诸家均已有所评议。我对旧诗未曾深学，不敢妄加品第。但诗人为他这本集子写的《自序》，以杂文气韵出之，我倒觉得也是一篇不可不读的好文章。
    谈到写诗的体会，他说：北大荒“劳动现场的一切，对我都是陌生的，也就都是新事物。尽管我天天劳累不堪，有时还不免因劳累而怨天尤人，但这新事物又有许多都是我想写或能写的。”有生活，有生活的真实感受，想写而又能写，这话说得何等真切。而写诗缺此一条则不可。谈到旧体诗时，他说：“以为旧诗适合于表达某种感情，２０余年来，我恰有此种感情，故发而为诗；诗有时自己形成，不用我作，如斯而已。”这种体会，可谓一语道破写诗之道。记得哪一位作家说过，“构思差不多永远是从心里流出来的。”赵瓯北评东坡诗的妙处，也说在于“自然流出”，清人江弢叔诗云：“我要寻诗定是痴，诗来寻我却难辞。”似乎均近此旨。诗是有感于外然后内逼而出之，决不能缺乏内外交感强力而为之。当我读到聂翁此语时，不禁直呼“绝！绝！”其实，我们平时也有这种体验，但我们却没有能够用这么一句看似平常的语言道出。聂翁，真诗人也。
    我们平时说“写诗”，只是表示一种创作过程。实际上，诗的确是自己形成的。当然这不能理解为诗人只是一位某种“客观”的记录者。不是的。所谓“诗有时自己形成”，正是“诗人自己的形成”。当诗人有感于人、于事、于物，心中产生了某种感情（也就产生了某种思想、倾向），并且达到了饱和的时候，诗句就自然喷涌而出，这就和人们感极而泣、喜极而笑、眼泪夺眶而出一样。诗人有时为了急切地写下自己的句子，甚至笔不及书，手头发抖，浑身发冷。当然，诗人在生活中要创造条件促进这种感情的酝酿。这个过程很重要。如果没有这个过程，或者不经常创设这个过程，诗思就可能中断、枯竭，就是要写，也只能是勉强为之，那就一定不会出现好诗。当然，这只是就一方面而言，诗需要多方面的条件。
    为什么一些应制诗、应酬诗，或如现在的节日诗，很难出现好诗呢？原因可以推知。“命题赋诗”，诗人自己首先并没有动感情，特别是没有真正有所激动，又怎么能够使他的读者感动、激动呢？
    还有一点，他谈得也很有意思。他说自己不懂做诗，“到现在也仍然不完全相信我做的诗果是诗，不懂别人所做的诗有何好坏，以及好到什么程度，不好又到什么程度。”这在聂翁，不无“自谦”，但在我读来，却深有感触，好像正是为我而道者。做到清醒、自知，多么不容易啊！
