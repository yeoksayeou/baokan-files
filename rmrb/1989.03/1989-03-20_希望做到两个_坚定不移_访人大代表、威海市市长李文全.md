The Seventh National People's Congress (NPC) is about to convene. What is the greatest hope of the people of Weihai? Li Wenquan, a representative of the Seventh NPC and the mayor of Weihai, said, "We hope to achieve two 'unwavering' goals: unyielding economic rectification and unyielding reform and opening up."

Li Wenquan told the reporter that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Weihai has developed rapidly. In June 1987, Weihai was elevated from a county-level city to a prefecture-level city with the approval of the State Council, and subsequently became one of the coastal open cities. This marked a new phase of development. In 1988, compared to 1987, there was an increase in grain, oil, fruit, and fish production. Industrial tax revenue grew by 53.3%, and the value of exported goods increased by 20.7%. Last year, 44 contracts were signed for utilizing foreign capital, totaling $110 million. The city has established 26 key export-oriented industrial towns and more than 140 export-oriented enterprises, and has established economic and trade relations with 24 countries and regions. The living standards of urban and rural residents have also significantly improved. Without the overall policy of reform and opening up, these achievements would not have been possible.

"Should coastal open cities implement economic rectification?" Li Wenquan said, "Although Weihai is a newly established coastal open city, it faces issues such as economic overheating, excessive construction scale, excessive demand, and rapid price increases. Therefore, it is equally necessary to carry out economic rectification resolutely. After half a year of efforts, initial results have been seen. The industrial structure has been initially adjusted, and the growth rate of light textiles and other daily consumer goods has far exceeded the average industrial growth rate. The foundation of agriculture is being strengthened."

　　希望做到两个“坚定不移”
    ——访人大代表、威海市市长李文全
    本报记者  于宁
    七届全国人大二次会议即将开幕，威海人最大期望是什么？七届全国人大代表、威海市长李文全说：“希望做到两个‘坚定不移’：治理整顿坚定不移，改革开放坚定不移。”
    李文全告诉记者，党的十一届三中全会以来，威海市发展很快，自１９８７年６月，威海市经国务院批准由县级市升为地级市，接着又成为沿海开放城市之一后，迈出了新的步伐。１９８８年同１９８７年相比，粮、油、果、鱼增产，工业税利增长５３．３％，外贸出口商品收购额增长２０．７％。去年一年共签署利用外资的合同４４项，成交额达１．１亿美元。全市已建成出口工业重点卫星镇２６个，外向型企业１４０多家，与世界上２４个国家和地区建立了经济贸易关系。城乡人民生活水平也明显改善。没有改革开放的总方针，这些成就是不可能取得的。
    “沿海开放城市要不要实行治理整顿呢？”李文全说，威海市虽然是个新设的沿海开放城市，但是经济过热，基建规模过大，需求过旺，物价上涨过猛等问题同样存在，所以同样必须坚决进行治理整顿。经过半年的努力，已经初见成效，产业结构初步得到调整，轻纺等日用消费品的增长速度已经大大超过工业平均增长速度，农业基础地位正在加强。
