Title: That Five on Screen

I watched the television series "That Five" with great interest and anticipation. Although I read Deng Youmei's novel five or six years ago, the absurd and humorous stories of That Five and his cowardly soul of a fallen aristocrat still vividly remain in my heart. Through a kind of Chinese humor and richly humorous ridicule, Deng Youmei sang a lament for the buried feudal aristocracy. The author, following this useless and pitiful character wandering through Beijing, vividly expressed his deep sighs of human joy and sorrow, clear social consciousness, and profound historical criticism. After reading "That Five," I couldn't help but think of Al Q from Lu Xun's works. In those years, Deng Youmei consecutively wrote five or six very excellent novels set against the backdrop of old Beijing's market life, each with its own unique style and highly praised. However, I believe that the one with the highest literary value, truly creating an artistic archetype, is still "That Five." Because we not only saw the unique personality and psychological world of this descendant of the old aristocracy, but also saw the broad social life and historical changes surrounding his historical fate.

Now That Five has appeared on the television screen, directed by the veteran comedian Xie Tian, I have reason to expect a television drama with both high entertainment value and high cultural value to appear in our country. I hope that the That Five in the television drama will become a true artistic archetype with a Chinese style.

The television drama indeed had a huge appeal to the audience. Especially in the first three episodes, That Five, dreaming of making money, ends up losing everything after selling fake antiques; wanting to taste the flavor of being a "celebrity," he impersonates a novelist and barely escapes a beating; teaming up with Jia Fenglou to cheat money, he ends up stripped naked... These vivid and interesting plots truly depicted That Five's aristocratic mannerisms and sour sense of superiority, as well as his embarrassment and sadness in navigating the old society. No wonder someone praised it as a successful "social drama," probably referring to its true and vivid portrayal of the various characters' expressions and customs, deception and fraud, social indifference, and human warmth in old Beijing. The customs and social atmosphere of old Beijing in this television drama are not merely displayed as an exhibition, but are naturally highlighted as the historical environment and atmosphere for the development of the characters' personalities, thus enriching the social significance and cognitive value of each dramatic scene.

However, in the later episodes, it is not difficult to see that the director encountered an artistic dilemma. The novel's ending, which is open and leaves room for the reader's imagination, requires a complete story structure in a drama, especially since television dramas are a form of popular art enjoyed by both the elite and the masses, lacking lively plots will lose the audience's interest. Accompanying the demand for such a story structure, the true difficulty the director faced in the second creation is the grasp of That Five's personality, how to understand and embody the ideological significance of this archetype. It is precisely on this point that I must honestly say, while I appreciate it, I also feel a great regret.

The director of the television drama, filled with goodwill, poured warm sympathy into That Five, hoping he would become a progressive person, and thus tried to show his awakening in adversity, to explore the goodness and beauty in his soul, so that the audience could feel the oppression of evil forces on a weak person from That Five's story, and deeply feel how difficult it is to be a good person in the old society. Thus, there appeared scenes where That Five resisted the radio station's fake drug advertisements, returned money to the deceived old lady, and lay in prison dreaming of pastoral idylls... These scenes are very inconsistent with That Five's personality. The result of this handling is that although That Five's story has become more popular, the image has become blurred, and the social content and critical power it contains have been weakened and reduced, returning the television drama to a theme we often see in many plays.

One critic believes that the author, through That Five, showed us the appearance of a ridiculous, pitiful, sad, and lamentable Eight Banner descendant, layer by layer stripping off this nobleman's clothes, revealing the weakness, cowardice, sourness, and hypocrisy of this descendant of a declining class. Apart from eating, drinking, and playing, apart from slowly squandering the ancestral heritage like tofu, what else can he do? The author tore apart the worthless things of life to show everyone, using comedy to convey profound thoughts.

This is the essence of That Five's personality. Unfortunately, the director of the television drama, in shaping this character, precisely ignored and abandoned the most important and unique meaning of this image, turning a satirical image with strong contemporary significance and warning value into a general small character full of human warmth who finds no way out in the old society. This is because the director replaced the cold historical scrutiny of That Five with warmth and goodwill, emphasizing the vividness of the tragic and joyful plots while weakening the sharp satirical nature, making this television drama, which should have had a more distinctive era characteristic, lack novelty and the critical edge of thought.

Am I being too harsh on the television drama? Those with the ability to reach a higher level of adaptation and direction will understand, right?

### 那五走上屏幕以后

　　那五走上屏幕以后
    我是抱着很大的兴趣和期望观赏电视连续剧《那五》的。邓友梅的小说读过虽已五、六年了，但那五的那一个个荒唐可笑的故事，和他那颗没落阶级纨袴子弟的卑怯灵魂，却依然活生生地留在我的心里。邓友梅透过那种中国式的幽默、极富情趣的调侃嘲讽，为被埋葬的封建贵族唱了一首无可奈何的挽歌。小说作者随着这个无用的可怜儿在北京城里的飘泊游荡，把他心底里深沉的人世哀乐的感叹，清醒的社会意识和深刻的历史批判，生动地表现了出来，竟使我读完《那五》便不由得想起了鲁迅笔下的阿Ｑ。那几年，邓友梅连续写了五、六篇十分精采的以旧北京市井生活为背景的小说，风格自成，颇得赞赏。但我认为其中文学价值最高，真正称得上创造了一个艺术典型的，还是《那五》这篇。因为我们不仅看到了这个旧式贵族后裔的独特性格和心理世界，同时也看到了围绕着他的历史命运所展现的广阔的社会生活和时代变迁。
    现在那五走上了电视屏幕，由有深厚艺术功力的喜剧家谢添担任总导演，我便有理由期望看到一部既有很高的观赏价值又有很高的文化价值的电视剧在我国出现，我期望电视剧里的那五成为一个真正具有中国风格的艺术典型。
    电视剧果然对观众产生了巨大的吸引力。特别是在前三集中，做着发财梦的那五偷卖古董而落得连本抖光；想尝尝“名人”滋味冒名小说作家险遭一顿饱打；与贾凤楼做连裆捧角儿骗钱最后落得个扒光了衣服，……这些生动有趣的情节，真把那五的一副贵公子做派和酸溜溜的家世优越感，以及他在人欲横流的旧社会混世的窘迫和悲哀，表演得淋漓尽致。难怪有人称赞这是一部成功的“世相剧”，大概也是指它把旧京城里各式人物的神情风貌、哄骗和欺诈、世态炎凉和人情冷暖，表现得真实而又生动。旧京城的风俗世态在这部电视剧里不是表象化的展览，而是作为人物性格发展的历史环境和氛围，真实自然地烘托出来，从而使一个个戏剧场面获得了丰富的社会性和认识价值。
    但是，到了后面几集，就不难看出编导者碰到了一个艺术上的难题。小说中的那种没有结局、平淡的收场，而留给读者回味和想象的描述方式，到了戏剧里就得有一个首尾连贯的故事完整性，何况电视剧是一种雅俗共赏的大众艺术形式，缺乏生动的情节就会失去对观众的吸引。伴随着故事结构的这种要求，编导者在二度创作中遇到的真正难题，还是对那五性格的把握，怎样认识和体现这个典型的思想意义。正是在这一点上，我要坦诚地说，我一面赞赏着它，一面又感到了很大的遗憾。
    电视剧的编导者充满着善良的感情，把热烈的同情倾注到了那五身上，希望他成为一个长进者，因而极力去表现他在困境中的觉醒，发掘他灵魂中的善和美，使观众从那五的故事中感受到恶势力对一个弱小者的欺凌，痛感旧社会做一个好人是多么困难。于是，便出现了那五抵制电台做假药广告、退还受骗老太婆的钱、躺在牢狱里做着田园牧歌式的美梦……这样一些与那五性格很不谐调的情节。这样处理的结果，那五的故事虽然更加通俗化了，但这个形象却变得模糊起来，蕴含的社会内容和批判力量也被淡化和减弱了，电视剧又回到了一个我们在许多戏剧里常见的主题上。
    有位评论家认为，作家通过那五让我们窥见了一个可笑可怜可悲可叹的八旗子弟的尊容，一层层地把这个贵胄子弟的外衣扒光了，从而显出了这个没落阶级子孙的软弱、卑怯、酸腐和虚伪。他除了会吃、会喝、会玩，除了把祖宗的遗产切豆腐似的一点点荡光，还会做什么呢？作者是把人生无价值的东西撕毁了给大家看，用喜剧来寄寓深刻的思想。
    这就是那五性格的本质。可惜电视剧的编导在塑造这个人物时，恰恰忽视了、舍弃了这个形象最重要最独特的含意，把一个具有强烈的现实意义和警世价值的讽喻性形象，处理成了一般的富于人情味的在旧社会找不到出路的小人物。这是因为编导者用温情和善意代替了对那五的冷峻的历史审视，注重了悲喜交融的情节生动性而淡化了深刻的讽刺性，使这部本应具有更鲜明的时代特色的电视剧，反而变得缺乏新意和思想的批判锋芒了。
    我对电视剧是否太苛刻呢？对于有能力达到更高境界的改编和导演们，他们会理解吧？
