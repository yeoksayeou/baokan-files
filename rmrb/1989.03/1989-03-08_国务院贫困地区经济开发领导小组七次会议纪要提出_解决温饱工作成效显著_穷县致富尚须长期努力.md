The State Council's Leading Group on Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas, with the approval of the State Council, recently forwarded the "Minutes of the Seventh Meeting of the State Council's Leading Group on Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas." The main contents are excerpted as follows:

The State Council's Leading Group on Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas held its seventh plenary meeting on February 1, 1989. The meeting analyzed the current situation of economic development in poverty-stricken areas and discussed the main tasks and measures for the latter two years of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan."

1. Current Situation and Main Tasks for the Latter Two Years of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan"

The State Council proposed that during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, the basic subsistence problem of the majority of the people in poverty-stricken areas should be solved. Over the past three years, economic development in poverty-stricken areas has received high attention and broad support from all levels of party committees and governments, as well as from all sectors of society, achieving significant results. By the end of 1988, among the impoverished households supported by various provinces and regions, about 60% had solved the problem of basic subsistence. Among the more than 300 key counties supported by the state, 1/4 had crossed the basic subsistence line.

The current situation is as follows: First, although the total number of impoverished households has decreased, the remaining impoverished population who have not yet solved the problem of basic subsistence is mainly concentrated in areas with harsh natural conditions, low levels of social development, minority areas, reservoir areas, deep mountain areas, disaster-prone areas, and areas with difficulties in water supply for humans and livestock. The difficulty of poverty alleviation has increased, and the work of solving the problem of basic subsistence has entered the stage of tough battles. Second, although some impoverished counties have taken the lead in solving the problem of basic subsistence, the standards are low and not stable. The level of social productive forces has not undergone fundamental changes, and the gap with developed areas is still widening. To stably solve the problem of basic subsistence, truly form self-development capabilities, and get rid of poverty, long-term and arduous efforts are still needed.

Therefore, the main task for economic development in poverty-stricken areas nationwide in the latter two years of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" is: in accordance with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, to deeply implement the relevant documents of the State Council, to further take effective measures, concentrate forces, and fight a tough battle to solve the problem of basic subsistence, and strive to achieve the goal of solving the basic subsistence problem of the majority of the people in poverty-stricken areas during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period. On this basic premise, in accordance with the principle of classified guidance, continue to support impoverished counties that have crossed the basic subsistence line, and on the basis of consolidating achievements, realize the strategic shift from supporting thousands of households to solve the problem of basic subsistence to developing pillar industries in contiguous areas, and strive to make the majority of impoverished households that have already solved the problem of basic subsistence have an annual per capita net income close to or reach the average level of their respective provinces and regions as soon as possible.

2. Take Effective Measures to Achieve the Goal of Solving the Basic Subsistence Problem of the Majority of the People in Poverty-Stricken Areas During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" Period

(1) Various provinces and regions should conduct a comprehensive analysis and classification of the leading cadres of counties, townships, and villages that have not solved the problem of basic subsistence. For those leading cadres who are unable to complete the tough battle tasks, adjustments should be made as soon as possible to avoid missing the opportunity.

(2) To fully play the role of poverty alleviation special interest-bearing loans in solving the basic subsistence problem of impoverished households, accelerate the turnover of funds, and improve efficiency, the poverty alleviation special interest-bearing loans due at the end of the period should be collected by the county and used by the county for turnover, continuing to be used for poverty alleviation and development projects.

(3) Promote the use of plastic film hybrid corn to quickly solve the food problem of impoverished households in high-altitude and arid areas.

(4) Solving the problem of water supply for humans and livestock in poverty-stricken areas and arranging the living conditions of reservoir area immigrants are important components of solving the basic subsistence problem. Relevant departments at all levels should focus on the prevention and treatment of local diseases in poverty-stricken areas.

(5) The State Planning Commission should organize relevant departments to, in accordance with the State Council's decision to use 600 million yuan of medium and low-grade industrial products to replace relief efforts, continue to solve the transportation and water supply problems for humans and livestock in poverty-stricken areas this year, and arrange funds and materials early and specifically deploy the implementation.

(6) Further mobilize national ministries and commissions to establish point-to-point assistance for provinces and regions in the northwest and southwest with large areas of poverty and special circumstances, and give full play to the role of various levels of party and government organs, mass organizations, industrial and commercial enterprises, scientific research institutions, colleges and universities, democratic parties, and the People's Liberation Army in poverty alleviation and disaster relief.

3. Support Impoverished Counties that Have Solved the Basic Subsistence Problem to Enter the New Stage of Economic Development Focused on Regional Economic Development

The meeting believed that economic development in poverty-stricken areas is a long-term historical task, and completing this task requires two steps: the first step is to strive to solve the basic subsistence problem in a relatively short period of time; the second step is to develop the regional economy through long-term efforts and gradually get rid of poverty and become prosperous. Without the development of the regional economy, it is impossible to stably solve the basic subsistence problem and fundamentally change the face of poverty and backwardness. Therefore, after completing the first step of the task, it is necessary to timely enter the second step of economic development work.

4. Concentrate on Using Existing Poverty Alleviation Funds and Materials, and Fully Play the Economic Benefits

(1) The State Council decided that although this year's financial and credit funds are very tight, the funds allocated by the state for poverty alleviation will not be reduced. Local governments at all levels should also adhere to this principle, increasing where conditions allow and not reducing where conditions do not allow.

(2) To manage and use poverty alleviation funds from various channels well and improve economic benefits, it is necessary to seriously implement the State Council's instructions to bundle and concentrate the use of various poverty alleviation funds.

(3) Poverty alleviation and development institutions, fund and material management departments, and audit and supervision agencies at all levels should strengthen the supervision and inspection of the use of poverty alleviation funds and materials, and periodically publish the inspection results to accept social supervision. All acts of embezzlement, misappropriation, private division, and resale, as well as various acts of using power for personal gain, must be investigated and severely punished in a timely manner.

5. Run Poverty Alleviation Economic Entities Well, Develop Horizontal Cooperation, and Establish a High-Efficiency Input-Output Mechanism

Establishing poverty alleviation economic entities and developing horizontal cooperation between developed and poverty-stricken areas are two major reforms proposed by the State Council in poverty alleviation work, aiming to achieve the optimal combination of production factors nationwide, establish a high-efficiency input-output mechanism, and accelerate economic development in poverty-stricken areas. Therefore, these two reforms must be further deepened and improved over the next two years.

6. Strengthen Leadership, Improve Institutional Mechanisms, and Continue to Do a Good Job in Training Cadres

(1) Relevant provincial and regional governments at all levels should continue to regard poverty alleviation as an important economic and political task, with principal responsible comrades taking personal charge, directly overseeing key points, organizing forces, and strengthening leadership. At the same time, it is necessary to improve poverty alleviation and development institutions at all levels, replenish capable cadres, establish a stable and efficient working team with fixed personnel and positions, and provide necessary activity funds and working conditions.

(2) Over the next two years, it is necessary to continue to insist on training cadres from impoverished counties, townships, and villages. Local areas with difficulties in training funds for impoverished townships and villages can solve the problem from the technical training fees matched with the funds for supporting the development of underdeveloped areas and poverty alleviation special interest-bearing loans. At the same time, local areas should combine scientific and technological poverty alleviation, actively develop vocational training and adult education, and impart practical technologies and basic management knowledge to farmers on a large scale, continuously improving the quality of production and management personnel.

　　国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组七次会议纪要提出
    解决温饱工作成效显著
    穷县致富尚须长期努力
    本报讯  经国务院同意，最近国务院办公厅转发了《国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组第七次会议纪要》。主要内容摘录如下：
    国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组于１９８９年２月１日召开了第七次全体会议。会议分析了当前贫困地区经济开发的形势，讨论了“七五”计划后两年的主要任务和措施。
    一、当前形势和“七五”后两年的主要任务
    国务院提出“七五”期间解决大多数贫困地区人民温饱问题已经３年。３年来，贫困地区经济开发得到了各级党委、政府的高度重视和社会各界的广泛支持，成效显著。到１９８８年底，各省、区扶持的贫困户中已有６０％左右解决温饱问题，国家重点扶持的３００多个贫困县中有１／４越过温饱线。
    现在的问题是：第一，虽然贫困户总数减少了，但剩下的尚未解决温饱问题的贫困人口主要集中在自然条件恶劣、社会发育程度较低的少数民族地区、库区、深山区、多灾地区和人畜饮水困难地区，扶贫难度更大了，解决温饱问题的工作进入了攻坚阶段。第二，虽然一部分贫困县已经率先解决了温饱问题，但标准很低，不够稳定，社会生产力水平尚未发生根本性变化，而且与发达地区的差距仍在扩大，要稳定地解决温饱问题，真正形成自我发展能力，摆脱贫困，还要进行极为艰苦的长期努力。
    为此，“七五”后两年全国贫困地区经济开发的主要任务是：根据党的十三届三中全会精神，深入贯彻落实国务院有关文件，进一步采取有力措施，集中力量，打好解决温饱的攻坚战，努力实现“七五”期间解决大多数贫困地区群众温饱的目标。在这一基本前提下，根据分类指导原则，继续扶持越过温饱线的贫困县，在巩固成果的基础上，实现从扶持千家万户解决温饱问题向发展连片支柱产业的战略转折，争取尽快使现在已经解决温饱的大多数贫困户年人均纯收入接近或达到本省、区平均水平。
    二、采取有力措施，实现“七五”期间解决大多数贫困地区群众温饱问题的目标
    （一）各省、区对没有解决温饱的县、乡、村领导班子要进行全面分析，分类排队。对那些没有能力完成攻坚任务的领导班子要尽快进行调整，以免贻误时机。
    （二）为了充分发挥扶贫专项贴息贷款解决贫困户温饱问题的作用，加快资金周转速度，提高效益，到期扶贫专项贴息贷款由县组织回收，回收后由县周转使用，继续用于扶贫开发项目。
    （三）推广地膜杂交玉米，尽快解决高寒山区和干旱地区贫困户吃饭问题。
    （四）解决贫困地区人畜饮水困难，安排好库区移民生活，是解决温饱问题的重要组成部分。各级有关部门要把对贫困地区地方病的防治作为工作的重点。
    （五）由国家计委组织有关部门，按照国务院关于用６亿元中低档工业品以工代赈，继续解决贫困地区交通和人畜饮水问题的决定，今年及早安排资金和物资，具体部署实施。
    （六）进一步动员国家部委，对西北、西南贫困面大、情况特殊的省、区实行定点联系帮助，充分发挥各级党政机关、群众团体、工商企业、科研单位、大专院校、民主党派、人民解放军等社会各界扶贫济困的作用。
    三、扶持解决温饱的贫困县转入以发展区域经济为主的经济开发新阶段
    会议认为，贫困地区经济开发是个长期性的历史任务，完成这一任务要分两步走：第一步，努力争取在比较短的时间内先解决温饱问题；第二步，经过长期努力发展区域经济，逐步脱贫致富。没有区域经济的发展，稳定解决温饱以至根本改变贫穷落后面貌是不可能的。因此，完成第一步任务后，必须适时转入经济开发的第二步工作。
    四、集中用好现有的扶贫资金和物资，充分发挥经济效益
    （一）国务院决定，尽管今年财政、信贷资金非常紧张，但国家用于扶贫的资金不减少。各级地方政府也要坚持这个原则，有条件增加的增加，没有条件增加的也不要减少。
    （二）为了管好、用好来自各个渠道的扶贫资金，提高经济效益，必须认真执行国务院关于将各项扶贫资金捆起来集中使用的指示。
    （三）各级扶贫开发机构，资金、物资管理部门和审计、监察机关要加强对扶贫资金、物资使用的监督和检查，并定期公布检查结果，接受社会监督。对一切贪污、挪用、私分、倒卖以及各种以权谋私的行为，一定要及时查清，从严惩处。
    五、办好扶贫经济实体，发展横向联合，建立高效益的投入产出机制
    兴办扶贫经济实体和发展发达地区与贫困地区的横向联合是国务院提出的扶贫工作的两项重大改革，目的在于实现全国范围内生产要素的优化组合，建立一个高效益的投入产出机制，加快贫困地区经济开发。因此，今明两年一定要进一步深化完善这两项改革。
    六、加强领导、健全办事机构，继续搞好干部培训工作
    （一）有关省、区的各级政府要继续把扶贫作为一项重要的经济和政治任务，主要负责同志亲自过问，直接抓点，组织力量，加强领导。同时，要健全各级扶贫开发机构，充实得力干部，定编定员，建立一个稳定的高效率的工作班子，并提供必要的活动经费和工作条件。
    （二）今明两年要继续坚持对贫困地区县、乡、村干部的培训工作。各地轮训贫困乡、村干部经费有困难的，可从支援不发达地区发展资金与扶贫专项贴息贷款配套的技术培训费中解决。同时，各地要结合科技扶贫，积极发展职业培训和成人教育，对农民大规模传授实用技术和基本的经营管理知识，不断提高生产经营者的素质。
