Chen Mu Hua Reports to the Standing Committee of the NPC
This Year's National Plan and Budget Are Feasible
The Financial and Economic Committee of the NPC Proposes Six Suggestions for Implementing the National Budget

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 30 - Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the NPC, Chen Mu Hua, reported on the examination of the draft of the 1989 national economic and social development plan at the second meeting of the presidium of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress held this afternoon. She said that the State Council has achieved successes in implementing the 1988 plan, with continuous development in social production, further enhancement of national economic strength, continuous expansion of opening up to the outside world and economic exchanges, and further development of various undertakings such as education, science and technology, culture, health, and sports. Economic system reform has also continued to deepen.

She said, however, that due to the State Council not fully executing the requirements and arrangements of the 1988 national economic and social development plan proposed by the State Council, many difficulties and problems have arisen, the most prominent of which is the obvious inflation and excessive price increases.

Chen Mu Hua said that the 1989 national economic and social development plan proposed by the State Council reflects the guiding principles determined by the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party and the deployment to focus on rectifying the economic environment and economic order in the next two years. She believes that, overall, the plan proposed by the State Council is feasible. She suggested that the National People's Congress approve the 1989 national economic and social development plan proposed by the State Council and the report on the 1989 national economic and social development plan draft by Vice Premier and Minister of the State Planning Commission, Yao Yilin.

She pointed out that after the national plan is approved, all levels of government must resolutely execute it. During the execution, periodic inspections and coordination should be conducted to timely solve problems arising from the execution, and periodic reports should be made to the Standing Committee of the People's Congress at the same level on the execution of the plan. If there are major adjustments, they should be reported to the Standing Committee of the People's Congress at the same level for examination and approval.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 30 - Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee of the NPC, Chen Mu Hua, reported on the examination of the execution of the 1988 national budget and the draft of the 1989 national budget today. She said that the national financial revenue and expenditure in 1988 both completed the national budget approved by the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress. The Financial and Economic Committee believes that, overall, the 1989 national budget proposed by the State Council is feasible.

She said that the Financial and Economic Committee believes that completing the 1989 budget will be a challenging task. The Financial and Economic Committee suggests that the National People's Congress approve the report on the execution of the 1988 national budget and the draft of the 1989 national budget by State Councilor and Minister of Finance, Wang Boping, and approve the 1989 national budget proposed by the State Council. It is also suggested that after the 1988 national final accounts are compiled, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress be authorized to approve them. At the same time, the Financial and Economic Committee suggests that, in addition to the 5 billion yuan of educational funds already increased in the 1989 national budget, various levels of government and departments should strive to increase revenue and reduce expenditures, tap potential, and increase educational funds as much as possible during the budget execution.

Chen Mu Hua said that during the execution of the 1989 national budget, various levels of government should conduct periodic inspections and report the execution situation to the People's Congress at the same level. If there are major adjustments, they should be reported to the Standing Committee of the People's Congress at the same level for examination and approval.

She said that the rectification and reorganization of China's national economy are underway, and the tasks ahead are quite arduous. To achieve the 1989 national budget, the Financial and Economic Committee suggests:

First, to seriously implement various measures to increase revenue and strengthen tax collection and management, resolutely prevent the loss of financial revenue. Paying taxes according to law is the duty of all units and citizens. It is necessary to carry out extensive patriotic tax payment propaganda and education to enhance the awareness of paying taxes according to law. Those who evade, underreport, or refuse to pay taxes should be punished according to law.

Second, to seriously strengthen the management of expenditures. All expenditures should be carefully calculated and frugal. Wasteful behaviors that squander national resources should be resolutely investigated and dealt with.

Third, to focus on economic benefits and strive to turn losses into profits.

Fourth, to strictly follow the budget and manage finances according to law. After the budget is approved, from the central to local levels, no additional revenue or expenditure should be allowed. The practice of issuing arbitrary vouchers should be corrected. The use of contingency funds must go through the prescribed approval procedures.

Fifth, to improve financial and economic systems, strictly enforce financial and economic discipline, and resolutely change the current lax discipline. Those who violate financial and economic discipline and those who cause losses and waste due to serious irresponsibility must be seriously investigated, and such behavior must not be tolerated. Financial and tax officials must act according to law and be honest and upright.

Sixth, to carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and frugal construction. All levels of cadres, especially high-level leaders, should be clean and diligent, and oppose all extravagant and wasteful behaviors.

　　陈慕华向人大主席团会议报告        
    今年国家计划和预算是可行的        
    人大财经委为实现国家预算提出六条建议
    据新华社北京３月３０日电  全国人大常委会副委员长、全国人大财经委员会主任委员陈慕华在今天下午举行的七届全国人大二次会议主席团第二次会议上作关于１９８９年国民经济和社会发展计划草案的审查报告时说，国务院在执行１９８８年计划的过程中，取得了成就，社会生产持续发展，国家经济实力进一步增强，对外开放和经济交往不断扩大，教育、科技、文化、卫生、体育等各项事业进一步发展，经济体制改革继续深入。
    她说，但是，由于国务院没有完全按照１９８８年国务院提出的国民经济和社会发展计划的要求和部署执行，也出现了不少困难和问题，最突出的是通货明显膨胀，物价上涨幅度过大。
    陈慕华说，国务院提出的１９８９年国民经济和社会发展计划草案，体现了党的十三届三中全会确定的指导方针以及把今明两年建设和改革工作的重点突出地放到治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序上来的部署。她认为，总的看来，国务院提出的计划是可行的。建议全国人民代表大会批准国务院提出的１９８９年国民经济和社会发展计划，批准国务院副总理兼国家计划委员会主任姚依林所作的《关于１９８９年国民经济和社会发展计划草案的报告》。
    她指出，在国家计划通过以后，各级政府必须坚决执行。在执行中，要定期进行检查，协调，及时解决执行中的问题，并定期向同级人民代表大会常务委员会汇报计划执行情况。如有重大调整，应该报同级人民代表大会常务委员会审查、批准。
    据新华社北京３月３０日电　全国人大常委会副委员长、全国人大财经委员会主任委员陈慕华今天在作财经委员会关于１９８８年国家预算执行情况和１９８９年国家预算草案的审查报告时说，１９８８年国家财政收入和支出都完成了七届全国人大一次会议批准的国家预算；财经委员会认为，总的看来，国务院提出的１９８９年国家预算是可行的。
    她说，财经委员会认为，要完成１９８９年预算，任务是艰巨的。财经委员会建议全国人民代表大会批准国务委员兼财政部部长王丙乾所作的《关于１９８８年国家预算执行情况和１９８９年国家预算草案的报告》，批准国务院提出的１９８９年国家预算，并建议在１９８８年国家决算编成后，授权全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准。同时，财经委员会建议，除了１９８９年国家预算中已增加的教育经费５０亿元外，在预算执行中各级政府和各个部门通过努力增收节支，挖掘潜力，尽可能再增加一些教育经费。
    陈慕华说，在１９８９年国家预算执行过程中，各级政府要定期进行检查，并定期向同级人民代表大会汇报执行情况。如有重大调整，应报同级人民代表大会常务委员会审查、批准。
    她说，我国国民经济的治理、整顿正在进行，今后的任务相当艰巨。为了实现１９８９年国家预算，财经委员会建议：
    第一、要认真落实各项增加收入的措施，并强化税收的征管工作，坚决杜绝财政收入流失。依法纳税是一切单位和公民应尽的义务，要广泛进行爱国纳税的宣传教育，增强依法纳税的自觉性。对偷税、漏税和抗税不交的，要依法惩处。
    第二、要认真加强对支出的管理。各项开支都要精打细算，厉行节约。对一些浪费国家资财的行为要坚决查处。
    第三、狠抓经济效益，努力扭亏增盈。
    第四、严格按预算办事，依法理财。预算批准之后，从中央到地方都不准开减收增支的口子。要纠正任意批条子的做法。预备费的动用必须经过规定的审批程序。
    第五、健全财经制度，严肃财经纪律，坚决改变目前纪律松弛的状况。对于违反财经纪律的，对于严重不负责任造成损失浪费的，一定要严肃查究，决不能姑息纵容。财税干部必须依法办事，廉洁奉公。
    第六、发扬艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国的优良传统。各级干部，特别是高级领导干部，要廉洁从政，克勤克俭，反对一切铺张浪费行为。
