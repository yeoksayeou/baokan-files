The new U.S. Secretary of Defense, Dick Cheney, has taken the oath of office.

Compared to the unfortunate John Tower, Cheney's entry into the Pentagon was remarkably smooth. During the vote, not a single vote of opposition was cast. This was partly due to his personal life being as “clean as a hound's teeth,” but his rich political experience and skill in handling conflicts are also very important factors.

Cheney is 48 years old and has been in politics for 20 years. From 1975 to 1976, Cheney served as the White House Chief of Staff in the Ford administration, where he performed his duties with great success. Starting in 1978, he served five consecutive terms as a member of the House of Representatives and was an important member of the House Intelligence Committee, earning the title of "intelligence affairs expert." In Congress, Cheney has good interpersonal relationships and is skilled at handling internal conflicts within the Republican Party, factional disputes, and disputes between the two parties. He is respected and trusted by people from all walks of life. He also plays a bridging role between young and old Republican representatives. Some Democrats say Cheney is one of the few individuals who "understands both administrative work and legislative work."

During his time in Congress, Cheney liked to wear old-fashioned suits and cowboy boots to work, earning him the nickname "the Congressman who wears cowboy boots." Now, the "Defense Secretary who wears cowboy boots" faces many challenges.

Cheney holds conservative political views and takes a hardline stance on many issues. On U.S.-Soviet relations, he believes that although the Soviet Union's foreign policy has undergone some changes, the confrontation between the East and the West still exists. Therefore, future negotiations on arms reduction with the Soviet Union will not be easy.

On relations with allied countries, Cheney believes that collective security is the "only strategy" for the West, and Western countries should strengthen defense cooperation. However, whether the U.S.'s allies are willing to cooperate and share the defense burden is another thorny issue.

On the issue of reducing military spending and domestic economic and fiscal problems, Cheney has supported Reagan's policy of expanding military and economic policies. Now he still emphasizes that unless the Soviet Union significantly reduces its military, the United States has no reason to significantly reduce its own military strength. Meanwhile, Congress is pressuring the government to reduce the deficit and military spending, and balance the budget. Congress and the White House are mutually constrained, and the Secretary of Defense caught in the middle will not be short of things to do.

　　切尼——“穿牛仔靴”的国防部长
    美国新任国防部长迪克·切尼已经宣誓就职。
    与倒霉的约翰·托尔相比，切尼入主五角大楼显得格外顺利。在投票表决时，一张反对票也没有。这固然由于他的私生活“像猎狗的牙齿一样干净”，但其从政经验丰富，善于处理矛盾也是很重要的因素。
    切尼今年４８岁，步入政坛已２０年。１９７５至１９７６年，切尼曾在福特政府担任过白宫办公厅主任，工作颇有成绩。１９７８年起，他连任五届众议员，是众院情报委员会重要成员，有“情报事务专家”之称。在国会，切尼人际关系好，善于处理共和党的内部矛盾、派别之争和两党之间的纠纷，受到各界人士的尊重与信赖，他在共和党的年轻议员和老议员之间也起着桥梁作用，有的民主党人说切尼是少有的“既了解行政工作又了解立法工作的人材。”
    在国会任职期间，切尼喜欢穿老式西服和牛仔靴上班，人称“穿牛仔靴的国会议员”。现在，“穿牛仔靴”的国防部长面临着许多难题。
    切尼政治态度保守，对许多问题持强硬立场。在对苏关系上，他认为尽管苏联目前的对外政策发生一些变化，但东西方的对峙依然存在，因此今后在裁军问题上与苏打交道时并不轻松。
    在同盟国关系上，切尼认为，集体安全是西方的“唯一战略”，西方各国应该加强防务合作。但美国的盟国是不是愿意合作，共同分担防务费用，这又是一个棘手问题。
    在削减军费和国内经济财政问题上，切尼曾支持里根的扩充军备政策和经济政策，现在他仍强调，除非苏联大规模裁减军备，美国没有理由大规模削减自己的军事实力，而国会又在压政府削减赤字与军费，平衡预算。国会与白宫相互掣肘，相互制约，夹在中间的国防部长将不发愁没事儿做。
