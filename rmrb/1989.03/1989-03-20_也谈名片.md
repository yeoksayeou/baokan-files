Title: Also on Business Cards

The 100 business cards I had printed last year have all been used up. As the new year begins, I feel it necessary to print another 100. When I was negotiating with the printing shop, I hesitated: last year, I had four titles printed on my business cards. How many should I print this year? Comrade Zhao Xiangru, in his article "The Tombstone Without Words and Titles on Business Cards" (published in the December 22, 1988, issue of the People's Daily), said: the titles on business cards are printed in "several rows," "like a bunch of grapes," "swinging like half a bottle of wine," and "smelling very sour"...

I do not intend to deny the praise Comrade Zhao Xiangru gave to the tombstone without words of Empress Wu Zetian. However, Empress Wu Zetian was indeed a very famous female emperor of the Zhou Dynasty. If everyone else also took her as an example and erected a tombstone without words in front of their own graves, then what would be left except stones? Our history books would also not have many elegant epitaphs.

In addition to praising Empress Wu Zetian, Comrade Zhao Xiangru also praised the business cards of Ye Nan, Shao Yanxiang, and Huang Zongjiang in his article. Those business cards are indeed unique, concise, and clear at a glance. Some have only the word "writer" before the name, while others leave a blank space before the name. They are good, but ordinary people probably cannot learn from them, because these three comrades have a relatively high reputation in the literary and artistic circles. If I were Ba Jin, then my business card could just have my name and address. Today, who among the slightly educated does not know Ba Jin? His biography, works, and position in modern literary history have been introduced, analyzed, and evaluated in detail. Taking it a step further, if I were the president or prime minister of a country, then I would not even need to print business cards, because their social interactions are often arranged in advance and accompanied by many government officials.

Let's return to the business cards of Huang Zongjiang mentioned by Comrade Zhao Xiangru. Zhao said that Huang Zongjiang had two types of business cards: "For compatriots, the business card only has the three characters Huang Zongjiang," and "For foreign affairs, there are several impressive titles." Why does he print two types of business cards? Zhao Xiangru's article did not explain this, but I think the reason is simple: compatriots generally understand Huang Zongjiang's situation, so there is no need to introduce it on the business card. However, foreigners may not understand Huang Zongjiang as well as we do, so Huang Zongjiang did not write only his name as Comrade Zhao Xiangru advocated.

The purpose of a business card is to introduce oneself during social interactions and to meet strangers. When both parties exchange business cards, they can immediately know each other's identities and what aspects of expertise each person has. This way, it is also convenient to find topics of interest and understanding for both parties, so as not to discuss calculus with a musician or discuss atomic physics with a production team leader. The more titles listed on a business card, the broader the range of topics that can be chosen.

We are not Empress Wu Zetian, nor are we famous writers, so when printing business cards, it is not a bad idea to list a few more titles, even if they are "like a bunch of grapes." After all, the printing shop does not charge based on the number of characters, so fully utilize the space on the business card to give others more opportunities to learn about you. What is "concise, even blank, leaving room for imagination and thought" can only be the privilege of scholars. For ordinary people like me, the blank space left on the business card gives others nothing but blank space, which will not have any "deep and profound" meaning.

After repeated consideration, I still decided to list four bunches of grapes on my business card.

　　也谈名片
    郭振亚
    去年印的１００张名片已经用完了。新年伊始，感到这劳什子有必要再印１００张。当我和印刷厂交涉时忽又迟疑了：去年，名片上的头衔印了４个，今年印几个呢？赵相如同志在其《无字碑与名片衔》（见１９８８年１２月２２日《人民日报》）中说：名片上的头衔印了“好几行”，“葡萄似的一串串”，“半瓶酒晃荡”，“酸气大发”……我是否需要避避“酸气”，删掉这一串串“葡萄”呢？
    赵相如同志在其大作中，对武则天的无字碑颂扬了一番，笔者对此也不打算否定。但武则天毕竟是知名度非常非常高的武周王朝的女皇帝，倘若别人也都以她为榜样，在自己的坟堆前竖一块无字碑，那么留下的除了石头还是石头，我们的史书上也就不可能有许多文情并茂的碑记了。
    赵相如同志除推崇武则天外，又在其大作中赞扬了叶楠、邵燕祥、黄宗江等人的名片，那些名片的确别具一格，简洁明快，一目了然，或在名字前只写作家，或在名字前留下一片空白，好则好，但一般人恐怕学不了，因为这三个同志在文艺界的知名度也是较高的。倘若我是巴金，那么我的名片上也可以只要名字和住址，在今天，稍有文化的人有谁不知道巴金呢？他的生平、作品、现代文学史上的地位，都有详尽的介绍、分析、评价。再进一步想象，倘若我是一个国家的总统或总理，那么，我连名片都不用印了，因为他们的社交常常都是事先安排好的，并有许多政府要员陪同。
    再回到赵相如同志提到的黄宗江的名片上。赵说黄宗江印有两种名片：“对国人的名片上只有黄宗江三字”，“用于外事的名片上，赫赫头衔好几个”。为什么他印两种名片？赵相如的文章没有解释，我想原因很简单，国人大都了解黄宗江的情况，所以名片上没有必要作介绍。而外国人就不一定像我们这样了解黄宗江了，所以黄宗江也没有像赵相如主张的那样只写上名字。我不知道“赫赫头衔好几个”是不是如同赵相如同志讽刺的“葡萄似的一串串”？
    名片的目的在于社交时自我介绍，与陌生人接触，双方名片一递，立即就可以知道相互身份以及你我各有哪些方面的特长，这样，也就便于找出双方都感兴趣、都能理解的话题，不致见了音乐家谈微积分，见了生产队长而大谈原子物理了。名片上的头衔缀的多，选择话题的范围也就更广泛。
    我们不是武则天，也不是名作家，所以在印制名片时，不妨把你的头衔多挂上几个，哪怕像“葡萄似的一串串”，反正印刷厂也不根据字数多少来收费，充分利用名片的空间，给别人多一点了解自己的机会，何乐而不为！不印头衔的“精练甚至空白，留给人以想象思索”只能是名士的专利。一般人如笔者之流，名片上留下的空白，给别人的除了空白还是空白，哪会有什么“深长和悠远”呢？
    经过反复琢磨，我的名片上还是挂上４串葡萄。
