From a swimming star in the 1970s to an aspiring astronaut in the 1980s, Heike Walpot is a woman of remarkable achievements. At 30 years old, she is currently a medical anesthetist at the University of Aachen Medical School in West Germany. Recently, she has been particularly excited because she has become one of the first batch of reserve astronauts for West Germany's space experiment program. Out of 1,800 applicants, only five were selected, two of whom are women, and she is one of them. This is her second major leap in life, transitioning from a distinguished swimmer to a space explorer.

In the 1970s, Heike was a standout athlete in West Germany. From 1977 to 1980, she broke the West German swimming record 10 times and participated in the Olympic Games. Time flies, and as she aged, she had to leave the sports arena to pursue a career as an anesthetist. In 1984, she married a Belgian radio journalist named Walpot, and they now have a lovely child.

Heike has higher aspirations for her life. One day, while watching television, she saw a report on the space experiment program and decided that this was her goal. With her husband's support, she boldly applied to join the astronaut reserve training program and was successfully selected. This opened up a new chapter in her life.

After being selected as a reserve astronaut, Heike left the medical school to undergo astronaut training. She has completed initial training in weightlessness at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, USA, and conducted weightlessness simulation experiments. She feels confident about her training. When discussing her training experiences, she jokingly said, "Weightlessness is similar to swimming; it's like holding your breath underwater and letting your body float." She believes that the more she learns in the rigorous training, the less psychological burden she will have.

Heike herself realizes that it is still too early to be called an astronaut, as the space program will be implemented in 1991, and only three out of the five reserve astronauts may be allowed to enter the space laboratory. However, she is determined to dedicate herself to the work of the space laboratory. Whether she goes to space or not is important, but more importantly, she wants to contribute to the progress of human science.

　　七十年代名扬泳坛
    八十年代志游太空
    贾光伟
    海克·瓦尔波特今年３０岁了，在联邦德国亚琛大学医学院任麻醉师。近来，她感到特别兴奋，因为她成了参加联邦德国太空实验计划的第一批预备队员。报名申请的有１８００人，而被录取者仅５名，其中两名是女性，她就是其中之一。这是她一生中的第二个飞跃，即从一名成绩卓著的游泳健儿飞跃成为遨游太空的宇航员。
    海克在７０年代是联邦德国体坛的佼佼者，从１９７７年到１９８０年，接连１０次破了联邦德国的游泳纪录，曾参加过奥运会的比赛。时间如流水，随着年龄的增长，她不得不离开体坛从事麻醉师的职业。１９８４年，她与比利时电台记者瓦尔波特结婚，现有了一个可爱的孩子。
    海克对自己的生活有更高的追求。一天，在电视中，她看到有关太空实验计划的报道，认定这就是她追求的目标。在丈夫的支持下，她毅然报名参加招聘宇航员预备队员的考试，结果榜上有名，从此，她的生活又有了新的天地。
    被录取成预备队员后，海克离开了医学院，参加了宇航飞行训练。她在美国休斯敦航天中心已通过了失重状态下的初步训练，并进行了失重模拟试验。她自我感觉良好。谈到训练体会时，她打趣地说，“失重状态与游泳有相似之处，好像在水下屏气让身体漂浮起来一样。”她认为在艰苦的训练中，学习的东西越多，心理负担也会越少。
    海克自己认识到，现在被称作为宇航员还为时过早，因为太空计划要１９９１年付诸实施，在５名预备队员中最多只有３人能获准进入太空实验室。不过，她立志要投身太空实验室的工作。能否上太空固然重要，但更重要的是为人类科学进步作贡献。（附图片）
