According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 22 (Reporters Zhou Aiguo, Zhang Hushen) Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Li Xiannian this afternoon visited the Friendship Hotel to meet with members from the agriculture, forestry, religious, ethnic minorities, news and publishing, Hong Kong and Macao, Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, Taiwan Democratic Alliance, returned overseas Chinese, social welfare, and specially invited groups attending the Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the CPPCC. He hoped that everyone would discuss national affairs well.

In the Science Hall, both Chinese and foreign reporters eagerly interviewed Li Xiannian. A Hong Kong reporter asked Li Xiannian to say a few words to the people of Hong Kong. Li Xiannian spoke into the extended recorder, "I hope Hong Kong will prosper." Another Hong Kong reporter asked, "Do you have confidence in the future of Hong Kong?" Li Xiannian said, "Of course, we have confidence, and the people of Hong Kong should also have confidence." A Taiwan reporter asked Li Xiannian, "If journalists from Taiwan come to the mainland for official reporting, will you welcome them?" Li Xiannian said, "Welcome."

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 22 (Reporters Wu Shishen, Li Zhiyong) Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Qiao Shi today, during the discussion of the government work report by the Shanghai delegation, said that this year is a crucial year for rectification and adjustment. Only by winning this year and continuing to work hard, can the economic situation have a new turnaround.

When discussing how Shanghai can face the challenges of rectification and adjustment, Qiao Shi suggested that Shanghai should firmly implement the policy of opening up to the outside world, fully utilize its technological and port advantages, expand product exports and earn foreign exchange, and forge a new path for economic development. He believed that as long as Shanghai works hard and perseveres for ten or twenty years, its appearance will fundamentally change.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 22 (Reporter Zhou Changxin) State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission Li Tieying today afternoon, during a talk with education sector members attending the Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the CPPCC, said that over the past ten years, China's education cause has developed and progressed year by year, but it has also exposed some sharp problems. The main manifestations are that the system is not smooth, lacks vitality, and cannot adapt to the needs of planned commodity economy development, thus attracting the attention and concern of all sectors of society.

When discussing the improvement of teachers' remuneration and social status, Li Tieying said that a system of teachers' salaries, medical care, housing, retirement, and reward should be established. Li Tieying also exchanged views with the members on the issue of educational system reform.

　　李先念看望各界政协委员        
    乔石李铁映分别同代表委员座谈
    据新华社北京３月２２日电  （记者邹爱国、张虎臣）全国政协主席李先念今天下午到友谊宾馆，看望了出席全国政协七届二次会议的农林、宗教、少数民族、新闻出版、港澳、台联、台盟、归侨、社会福利、政协特邀等方面的委员，希望大家把国家大事议好。
    在科学会堂里，中外记者争相采访李先念。一位香港记者请李先念对香港人民说几句话。李先念对着伸过来的录音机说：“希望香港繁荣昌盛。”另一位香港记者问：“您对香港前景有信心吗？”李先念说，“我们当然有信心，香港人民也应该有信心。”一位台湾记者问李先念：“如果台湾记者正式来大陆采访，你们欢迎吗？”李先念说：“欢迎。”
    据新华社北京３月２２日电　（记者吴士深、李志勇）全国人大代表、中共中央政治局常委乔石今天在上海代表团审议政府工作报告时说，今年是治理整顿的关键年，只有赢得今年，并继续扎扎实实抓下去，经济形势才可能有新的转机。
    当谈到上海如何在治理整顿中接受挑战时，乔石建议说，上海要坚定不移地执行对外开放的政策，充分发挥技术优势、口岸优势，扩大产品出口创汇，闯出一条经济发展的新路子。他认为，只要上海下大功夫，埋头苦干，花十年、二十年时间，面貌会有根本的变化。
    据新华社北京３月２２日电　（记者周长新）国务委员、国家教委主任李铁映今天下午在同出席全国政协七届二次会议的教育界委员座谈时说，近１０年来，我国教育事业逐年有发展和进步，同时也暴露出一些尖锐的问题，主要表现为体制不顺，缺乏活力，不能适应有计划的商品经济发展的需要，因而引起社会各界的关注和忧虑。
    在谈到提高教师待遇和社会地位时，李铁映说，要建立一套教师工资、医疗、住房、退休制度和奖励制度。李铁映还就教育体制改革问题与委员们交换了意见。
