    The Beijing Railway Station, which had just relaxed a bit during the Spring Festival, saw a sharp increase in passenger flow starting from February 21. Now, the daily passenger volume has reached over 230,000. Among the passengers, 70% are migrant workers from Sichuan, Zhejiang, and Henan. Many of them have come to Beijing believing rumors that it is easy to earn money in the capital. The surge in transfer passengers has increased the burden on the Beijing Railway Station, and the influx of a large number of migrant workers has added pressure to Beijing's already tight labor market.

    Relevant departments advise migrant workers from other provinces: Do not believe rumors and blindly go out to work. Finding a job is not easy in Inner Mongolia and the Northeast, and it is not easy in Beijing either.

    The top image shows the 176th extra train from Guangzhou to Beijing, which is overcrowded, with many passengers standing throughout the journey.

    The left image shows migrant workers from other provinces lingering under the overpass at Beijing's Jian Guo Men, carrying their luggage and waiting for job opportunities, but very few have found work.

    北京打工也是不易
    春节期间刚刚轻松几天的北京站，2月21日起客流又猛增，现在每天达23万多人。旅客中70％的人是来自四川、江浙、河南一带的民工。许多人是听信外地好赚钱的传言，出外碰运气。中转量的激增，加重了北京站的负担，而大量民工涌入北京，又增加了本来就不宽松的北京劳务市场的压力。
    有关部门奉劝外地民工：不要听信谣传，盲目出外做工。内蒙古和东三省找工作不易，北京找工作也不易。
