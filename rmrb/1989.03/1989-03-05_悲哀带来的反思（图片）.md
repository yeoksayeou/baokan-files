There is not a hint of a funeral atmosphere here, only cries and sorrow, reflecting on the value of life.

These are farmers from the fifth team of Yu Jia Guan Village, Sanhe Township, Jiangyou City. They have just returned from burying the ashes of their sons.

Originally, on January 17th, as soon as it got dark, the sons of these farmers carried plastic oil barrels to the nearby Chuanxi North Petroleum Mining District to steal oil. They climbed over the walls and crossed the nets into the oil tank area of the mining team, but never returned. Later, their bodies were fished out from the sewage pool in the oil tank area. After several days of investigation by the public security officers and the autopsy by the forensic experts, it was concluded that they died from "oil poisoning." It is truly pitiful for their parents who raised them.

    悲哀带来的反思
    这里没有丁点葬礼的气氛，有的只是哭声和悲哀，反思着人生的价值。
    这几位是江油市三合乡喻家观村五组的农民。他们刚掩埋了各自儿子的骨灰回来。
    原来，1月17日，天刚黑，这几位农民的儿子携带塑料油桶去附近的川西北石油矿区采气队偷原油，翻墙越网进了该队油罐区，却一去不复返，事后在油罐区的排污池内打捞起了他们几人的尸体。经公安干警连日侦破和法医的验尸结果，系“原油中毒致死”。真可怜养育他们的父母们。
