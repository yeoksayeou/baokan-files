Sudan's five-member Supreme Committee continued consultations today with leaders of various parties to resolve the serious political crisis stemming from the standoff between the government and the military.

Yesterday, Nour al-Da'im, the secretary-general of Sudan's largest ruling party, the Umma Party, announced that his party agreed to dissolve the cabinet within 48 hours to form a new, broadly-based government.

He said the Umma Party would nominate a new prime minister to replace Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi.

This announcement came six hours after the Supreme Committee's consultations with leaders of 32 parties to resolve the national political crisis failed.

On February 21, a final ultimatum signed by 300 officers demanded a major government reshuffle and political reforms, putting the military and government at serious odds.

Last night, 38 political parties and trade unions held a lengthy joint meeting, reaffirming their support for the military and calling for the immediate resignation of the current government to form a national salvation government.

　　苏丹同意解散内阁
    军政对立酿成政治危机
    新华社喀土穆３月２日电  苏丹五人组成的最高委员会今天继续同各党派领导人进行磋商，以解决政府同军队对立产生的严重政治危机。
    苏丹最大的执政党乌玛党秘书长努尔·达伊姆昨天宣布，他的党已同意在４８小时内解散内阁，以成立一个基础广泛的新政府。
    他说，乌玛党将提名一位新总理以取代迈赫迪总理。
    这是最高委员会同３２个政党领导人协商解决国家政治危机失败６小时后，乌玛党宣布上述决定的。
    上月２１日，有３００名军官签名的一份最后通牒要求政府进行大改组并进行政治改革，使军队同政府处于严重对立之中。
    ３８个政党和工会组织昨夜举行了长达数小时的联席会议，重申了他们对军队的支持，并呼吁现政府立即辞职，以组成一个民族救国政府。
