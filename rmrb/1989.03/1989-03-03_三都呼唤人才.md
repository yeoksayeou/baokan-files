Three Counties Call for Talent

By Zhū Wéiqún, Reporter of People's Daily

In Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, people refer to Sandu Water Autonomous County as the "only daughter" of the nation because it is the only Water Autonomous region in the country. There are over 140,000 Water people here, accounting for 65% of the total population. However, this "only daughter" is also one of the "national-level" poverty-stricken counties, with more than 100,000 people still facing food shortages and 40,000 people without access to drinking water.

Sandu has fertile land, a mild climate, and can harvest crops twice or even three times a year. Underground, there are abundant copper, iron, antimony, coal, mercury, sulfur, and gold mines. The mountains have 3 million cubic meters of timber reserves, which is 1.1 times the provincial average. Why has this land, which is as beautiful as a phoenix's feather, not yet shaken off poverty? Lu Daobang, the head of the United Front Work Department of the prefecture and a Water cadre who has long served in Sandu, told me: "The remote mountainous geography and the historically formed economic backwardness are indeed the main causes of poverty. However, what currently hinders us from quickly shaking off poverty is the lack of talent."

A sharp contradiction that stands out is that, under the attractive prospects and preferential conditions of rapid development in coastal areas, the trend of "keeping them" among the intellectuals in Sandu is becoming more and more pronounced. Incomplete statistics show that from 1978 to 1987, 173 teachers left the county, including 28 university graduates from the three middle schools in the county, accounting for 40% of the total number of teachers in these three schools; 58 agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy system technical personnel left, accounting for 52% of the total; 95 medical system technical personnel left, accounting for 40% of the total...

Alongside "keeping them" is the issue of "not being able to get in" and "not being able to return." Due to weak foundational education, from 1977 to 1987, only about 400 people from the county were admitted to colleges and universities. During these 10 years, only 119 people graduated from colleges and universities and returned to work in Sandu.

In today's era where various places are competing to attract talent, Sandu is struggling to "recruit" due to the lack of competitive preferential conditions. The county's township enterprises have not yet had a single intermediate-level technical personnel, with the only person holding a junior title being the director of the Township Enterprise Bureau, Old Wei.

Due to the lack of talent, the county's previously established ceramic factory, phosphate fertilizer factory, paper mill, sugar mill, sulfur factory, and brewery have all collapsed. Last year, even 10 million yuan of national poverty alleviation loans could not be used up because there was a lack of people who could propose and verify projects.

Poverty makes it difficult to retain talent, and the lack of talent deepens poverty. How can we break out of this vicious cycle? Some comrades in the county committee believe that first, we must continue to oppose the tendency to belittle knowledge, education, and intellectuals caused by backwardness and ignorance, and truly mobilize the enthusiasm of existing scientific and technological personnel to contribute to the development and progress of minority areas. Some current practices are not appropriate. For example, due to the imbalance in the professional composition of the scientific and technological team in Sandu, they often take from one place to fill another, resulting in many of the few scientific and technological personnel having professions that do not match their expertise. Among the 15 professional and technical personnel in the county's agricultural and pastoral bureau, 6 are not using their expertise. A comrade from the county's organizational department said that practice has proven that solving the problem of talent outflow cannot be achieved solely through "blocking." Blocking can only make those who originally intended to try their hand in backward areas also dare not come. It is better to change the static balance of "permanent roots" to a dynamic balance of "in and out, service period, and reasonable flow," meeting the demand for talent in remote areas through talent flow.

They also hope that the national policy will pay more attention to the issue of talent in minority impoverished areas. For example, in college admissions, they can plan to recruit and train professionals according to the reported needs of these areas and appropriately lower the admission score line. Deputy Governor Mò Shírén said worriedly: "Currently, relevant national departments are considering canceling the unified allocation of college graduates in a few years and implementing paid allocation. If this is done in one stroke, the talent crisis in counties like Sandu will become more and more serious in the future. We suggest that the state also adopt a dual-track system in allocation, continuing to implement partial planned allocation for minority impoverished areas for a transition period. Even if the allocated people work for three or four years and then leave, it would be fine."

"Of course, from a long-term perspective, the fundamental way to save Sandu's talent crisis lies in developing foundational education," said the director of the Sandu County Education Bureau: "However, due to a lack of funds, currently, the county has over 3,000 school-age children but only enough school buildings to accommodate 1,000, and many of them are dilapidated. Every time we receive an emergency call from the countryside, our hearts pound, fearing that it is news of a collapsed building injuring people!"

In summary, Sandu is calling for talent, calling for education!

    三都呼唤人才
    本报记者　朱维群
    在黔南布依族苗族自治州，人们称三都水族自治县是国家的“独养女儿”，因为它是全国唯一的水族自治地方。这里有水族14万余人，占总人口65％。但是这个“独养女儿”又是“国家级”贫困县之一，目前尚有10余万人未解决温饱问题、4万人未解决饮水问题。
    三都土地富饶，气候温和，农作物一年可二、三熟，地下有丰富的铜、铁、锑、煤、汞、硫磺和金矿，山上有300多万立方米木材蓄积，比全省平均水平高1.1倍。为什么这块“像凤凰羽毛一样美”的土地迄今未能摆脱穷困？州委统战部部长、曾长期在三都担任领导职务的水族干部陆道邦对我说：“偏远的山区地理环境、历史形成的经济落后状态，固然是贫穷的主要根源。但是目前阻碍我们迅速摆脱贫穷的，是缺乏人才。”
    一个摆在眼前的尖锐矛盾是，在沿海地区加速发展的诱人前景和优惠条件的引力下，三都知识分子队伍中“留不住”的势头愈趋愈烈。据不完全统计，从1978年到1987年全县教师外流173人，其中县城三所中学的大学本科毕业教师外流28人，占这三所学校教师总数的40％；农林水系统科技人员外流58人，占总数的52％；卫生系统科技人员外流95人，占总数的40％……
    与“留不住”并存的还有“考不上”和“回不来”。由于基础教育薄弱，从1977年到1987年全县考入大专院校的只有400多人。而在此10年间，从大专院校毕业回三都工作的仅119人。
    在各地竞相招揽人才的今天，三都由于拿不出富于竞争力的优惠条件而苦于“招不进”。全县乡镇企业迄今没有一个中级职称的技术人员，唯一有初级职称的是乡镇企业局局长老韦自己。
    由于缺乏人才，这个县曾经利用当地资源办起的陶瓷厂、磷肥厂、纸厂、糖厂、硫磺厂、酒厂等都先后垮掉了。前年甚至连国家的扶贫贷款尚有100万元没能用出去，因为缺少能提出项目、论证项目的人。
    贫困难以留住人才，人才缺乏又加深贫困。怎样从这个恶性循环的圈子里跳出来？县委一些同志认为，首先要继续反对由落后和愚昧造成的轻视知识、轻视教育、轻视知识分子的倾向，真正调动现有科技人员为少数民族地区发展进步做贡献的积极性。现在有些做法很不得当。比如，三都由于科技队伍专业构成的不平衡，往往拆东墙补西墙，以至仅有的科技人员中竟有许多人专业不对口。县农牧局15名专业技术人员竟有6人学非所用。县委组织部的同志说，实践证明解决人才外流问题不能单纯靠“堵”。堵，只能使原来有志到落后地区一试身手的人也不敢来了。不如变“永远扎根”式的静态平衡为“有进有出，服务有期，合理流动”的动态平衡，在人才流动中满足边远地区对人才的需求。
    他们还希望国家政策在人才问题上对少数民族贫困地区予以更多的关照。比如在高校招生中可以根据这些地区上报所需专业人才的情况实行有计划地定向招收培训，适当降低录取分数线。莫时仁副州长忧心忡忡地说：“目前国家有关部门考虑要在几年内取消大学毕业生统一分配，并实行有偿分配。如果这样一刀切下来，三都这样的县今后人才危机将越来越严重。我们建议国家在分配中也采取双轨制，对少数民族贫困地区继续实行部分计划分配，过渡几年。哪怕分来的人干三、四年再走也行。”
    “当然，从长远考虑，根本解救三都人才危机的出路还在于发展基础教育”，三都县教育局长说：“然而，由于经费短缺，目前全县有3000多学龄儿童却只能容纳1000多人的校舍，而且不少是危房，以至我们每当接到乡下来的紧急电话便紧张得心怦怦跳，生怕是塌房伤人的消息！”
    总之，三都在呼唤人才，呼唤教育！
