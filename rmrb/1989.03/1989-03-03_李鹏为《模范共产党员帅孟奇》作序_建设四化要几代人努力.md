Li Peng recently wrote a preface for the book "Model Communist Party Member Shuang Mengqi," which has been published by the Central Literature Press.

In his preface, Li Peng wrote: Shuang Mengqi is one of the most respected revolutionary veterans among women. She is unwaveringly loyal to the revolutionary cause. Whether facing the enemy's torture or enduring unjust accusations within the party, her iron will never wavered. She is upright and unyielding, never swayed by the tide. In matters of right and wrong, she always seeks the truth and stands by her principles. She cares deeply for her comrades and has a heart full of warmth for the people, always listening to the voices of ordinary people and helping them solve their problems. She is very passionate about education and has donated her hard-earned savings to the people's education and social welfare causes.

Li Peng said: We are currently implementing the policy of reform and opening up, building a modernized China, which is a very arduous task. It will take the efforts of several generations to complete. I warmly congratulate the publication of "Model Communist Party Member Shuang Mengqi" and hope that readers, especially young people, can be inspired by it.

    本报北京3月2日讯　李鹏同志前不久为《模范共产党员帅孟奇》一书作序。该书已由中央文献出版社出版。
    李鹏在序言中写道：帅孟奇同志是最受人崇敬的妇女界革命老前辈之一。她对革命事业无限忠贞，无论在敌人的酷刑面前，或是在党内蒙受不白之冤之时，都丝毫动摇不了她那钢铁般的意志。她为人刚正不阿，从不随波逐流。在是非面前，一贯实事求是，坚持原则。她对同志关心备至，对人民满腔热情，时时倾听来自普通群众的呼声，帮助他们排忧解难。她对教育事业十分热心，把自己多年节衣缩食省下来的仅有的一点积蓄捐献给人民的教育事业和社会福利事业。
    李鹏说：我们正在执行改革开放政策，建设四个现代化的中国，任务非常艰巨，要经过几代人的努力才能完成。我热烈祝贺《模范共产党员帅孟奇》出版，希望广大读者，特别是青年同志能从中受到启发。
