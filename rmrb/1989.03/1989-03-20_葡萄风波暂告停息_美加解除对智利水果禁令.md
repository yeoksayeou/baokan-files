Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 17th.

The grape controversy has temporarily subsided as the United States and Chile have reached a preliminary agreement to resolve the issue of Chilean fruit contamination.

According to the agreement, the United States will lift the ban on importing Chilean fruits. All grapes and berries arriving at U.S. ports will be subjected to random sampling and visual inspections by U.S. inspectors, with 5% of the shipments being opened for inspection. If any suspicious fruits are found, they will be immediately sent to the Food and Drug Administration's laboratory for chemical analysis.

According to the U.S. authorities' orders, all Chilean fruits currently in U.S. markets will be destroyed. It is estimated that it will take approximately 5-9 days for Chilean grapes to return to normal market availability.

Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, March 18th.

The Canadian Department of Health announced on March 18th that it would lift the ban on importing Chilean fruits and vegetables, but ordered the destruction of all previously imported Chilean fruits.

Currently, approximately 10 million pounds of Chilean fruits have been removed from Canadian market shelves, with about half of them being grapes.

The Department of Health emphasized that only after all previously imported Chilean fruits have been cleared can Chile resume exporting fruits to Canada.

　　葡萄风波暂告停息
    美加解除对智利水果禁令
    本报华盛顿３月１７日电  记者仓立德报道：美国、智利今天就解决智利水果掺毒事件达成了一项初步协议。
    根据这项协议，美国取消进口智利水果的禁令。所有到达美国港口的葡萄和各种浆果，均由美方检验员实行抽样检验和目力检验，开箱抽查数量为５％。一旦发现有疑点的水果，立即送往食品和药物管理局的实验室进行化学成份分析。
    根据美国当局命令，目前美国市场所有库存智利水果都将遭到销毁。据估计，恢复智利葡萄的正常上市约需５—９天。
    新华社渥太华３月１８日电　加拿大卫生部１８日宣布解除进口智利水果和蔬菜的禁令，但下令将已进口的智利水果全部销毁。
    目前，大约１０００万磅智利水果已从加拿大市场货架上撤下来，其中大约一半是葡萄。
    卫生部强调说，已进口的智利水果全部清理完毕后才能再从智利进口水果。
