The debate on Thor's nomination to be Secretary of Defense enters its second week. A Democratic senator expresses support for Thor.

Our reporter Zhang Qixun reports from Washington, March 6: As the U.S. Senate's debate on Thor's nomination to be Secretary of Defense enters its second week, Democratic Senator Hofflin announced today that he will vote in support of Thor. This is the first Democratic senator to publicly support Thor since the Senate debate began. Republicans hope this will bring a new turn to the Senate debate.

Hofflin, who has served as a judge, believes that Thor's past behavior is not entirely blameless, but this does not make him unqualified.

In the Senate, the Democrats have 55 senators, while the Republicans have 45. Even if the Republicans remain united, Thor will need the support of at least 5 Democratic senators to achieve a 50-50 tie.

President Bush, in a rally today, once again expressed that Thor is the most qualified candidate for Secretary of Defense. He urged senators to set aside partisan views and make a judgment based on Thor's expertise in defense. Local observers believe that the debate surrounding Thor's nomination is the "first political crisis" faced by the Bush administration.

　　托尔问题辩论进入第二周
    一民主党人表示支持托尔
    本报华盛顿３月６日电  记者张启昕报道：在美国参议院对托尔担任国防部长的提名进入第二周辩论时，民主党参议员霍夫林今天宣布他将投票支持托尔。这是自参议院辩论以来，第一位民主党人公开出来支持托尔。共和党人希望这将给参议院辩论带来新转机。
    霍夫林曾经担任过法官，他认为托尔过去的行为并不是无可指责的，但这不能成为他不合格的依据。
    在参议院中，民主党有５５名参议员，而共和党只有４５名。在共和党保持一致的情况下，托尔也至少要得到５名民主党参议员的支持，才能形成５０对５０的平局。
    布什总统今天在一次集会上又一次表示，托尔是最称职的国防部长人选，他呼吁参议员们摒弃党派之见，根据托尔对防务的专长作出判断。此间人士认为，围绕托尔提名的辩论是布什政府面临的“首次政治危机”。
