For many years, a yellow-brown smog has shrouded the world-famous city of Athens, mercilessly eroding its precious cultural relics. Due to the corrosion of sulfuric acid, the marble columns of the Parthenon, dedicated to the goddess Athena, are peeling off. The intricate reliefs and decorative patterns on the upper part of the temple have become unrecognizable. The six female columns standing at the front of the Erechtheion are covered in scars and have had to be replaced with cement replicas; … The blue sky and fresh air seem to have disappeared from the lives of the locals, and a foul odor occasionally wafts through the air. Darkness envelops the entire city, and the scenery often appears hazy. Because this smog is dirty and toxic, headaches, dizziness, and chest tightness have almost become daily companions for the people of Athens.

The OECD pointed out as early as 1980 that the concentration of sulfur oxides in Athens had doubled, leading to a corresponding increase in the number of hospitalizations for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The air in Athens is becoming increasingly acidic. Experts warn: "If we remain indifferent, Athens will have to be closed down in 10 years."

In the past few decades, Athens' urban development has been rapid and unbalanced. On less than 900,000 hectares of land, 40% of Greece's population, 60% of its industrial facilities, 65% of its wholesale trade, and 95% of its foreign trade are concentrated. Unplanned construction has destroyed large areas of greenery. The exhaust fumes, dust, and heat from countless cars and factories accumulate in the air, lingering for a long time. Coupled with Athens' geographical environment of being surrounded by mountains on three sides and water on one side, a unique inverted climate is formed: before dawn, heatwaves sweep in, much like a giant iron pot covering the city, making it stiflingly hot. Locals have a saying: "If the wind doesn't blow for three or four days, headaches will follow." But Athens rarely has wind.

The Greek government has decided to take measures to combat pollution and improve the natural environment of the capital. One of its anti-pollution plans directly affects people's primary mode of transportation—cars. Every day, 800,000 cars drive through the streets of Athens, and 3/4 of the pollutants in the air come from these cars. Since February 1988, vehicle use has been restricted. Cars can only be driven on alternate days based on the odd or even number of their license plates. The government has also regulated fuel, allowing only low-sulfur gasoline. To reduce traffic flow, Athenians have had to reluctantly change their old lunch break habits and adopt a continuous work schedule. Additionally, since last spring, Athens has established a "Tree Planting and Greening Award" to encourage citizens to plant trees and flowers in open spaces. Most government ministries will be relocated to the suburbs, some residents will move out of the capital, and a batch of buildings will be demolished. Athens' greenery will increase from the current 3% to 22% within 10 years. The long-discussed subway project is also expected to start construction in the near future.

The Greek government and people hope that through arduous efforts, they can once again see an ancient yet clean and beautiful Athens.

　　掀掉雅典娜头上的“铁锅”        
    ——希腊首都治理环境污染一瞥
    王芳
    多年来，一种黄褐色烟云笼罩世界名城雅典，无情地啃啮着珍贵的文化遗迹。由于硫酸的腐蚀，供奉雅典娜女神的巴特农神庙的大理石柱表面正在剥落，神庙上端的精美浮雕和花边图案，已经面目全非，立于埃雷赫修庙正面的６根女像柱，疤痕累累，只得用水泥复制品替代；……蓝天和清新的空气，似乎已从当地人的生活中消失，阵阵恶臭不时飘来。灰暗笼罩着整座城市，景物时常模糊不清。因为这种烟云肮脏有毒，长久以来，头疼、头晕、胸闷几乎天天陪伴着雅典人。
    经合组织早在１９８０年就指出，在雅典，氧化硫的成分增加了两倍，因此患呼吸道疾病和心血管病住院的人数在成倍增加。雅典的空气日益酸性化。专家们惊呼：“如再无动于衷，１０年后，雅典就必须关闭。”
    最近二三十年，雅典的城市建设发展迅猛且又不平衡。在不到９０万公顷的土地上，集中了希腊全国４０％的人口、６０％的工业设施、６５％的批发贸易和９５％的外贸。无计划建房破坏了成片绿化带。众多的汽车和工厂排放出的大量废气、烟尘和热量聚积在空中，久久不散，再加上雅典三面环山一面傍水的地理环境，形成一种奇特的颠倒了的气候：天未破晓，热浪就袭来，酷似一口巨大铁锅反罩在城市上空，闷热不堪。当地人有句口头禅：“三四天不刮风，就要闹头痛。”而雅典是很少刮风的。
    希腊政府决心采取措施，治理污染，改善首都的自然环境。它制定的一项反污染计划直接涉及到人们的主要交通工具——汽车。雅典街头，每天有８０万辆汽车行驶，空气中３／４的污染物来自这些汽车。从１９８８年２月起，车辆的使用受到限制。汽车只能根据其牌照号码的单双数隔天开。政府对燃料也做了规定，只允许用含硫低的汽油。为减少汽车流量，雅典人不得不忍痛改变午休旧习，采用了连续作息制。另外，从去年春天开始，雅典设立了“植树绿化奖”，鼓励市民在空地栽种树木花草。政府的大多数部级机关将分散到市郊，部分居民迁离首都，一批房屋建筑拆除，雅典的绿化面积在１０年内将从现有的３％提高到２２％。议论多年的地铁工程也可望在短期内开工。
    希腊政府和人民希望通过艰苦努力，能重新看到一个古老而又整洁秀丽的雅典。
