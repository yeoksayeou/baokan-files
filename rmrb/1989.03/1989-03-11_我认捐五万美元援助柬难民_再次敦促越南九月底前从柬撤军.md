	I pledge $50,000 to aid Cambodian refugees
	Urge Vietnam to withdraw troops by end of September

	The Chinese government today pledged $50,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to aid Cambodian refugees in Thailand.

	This was announced by Yu Meng Jia, China's Deputy Representative to the United Nations, at a donors' conference for Cambodia. The total amount pledged at the conference so far is $11 million.

	Since the Vietnamese army invaded Cambodia in 1978, approximately 300,000 Cambodian refugees have been living in refugee camps along the Thai border.

	Yu Meng Jia emphasized that the United Nations recognizes the Democratic Kampuchea as the legitimate government of Cambodia. Therefore, any interaction between UN agencies and the Phnom Penh regime for the purpose of providing relief must be conducted at the unofficial level.

	Yu Meng Jia pointed out that the Vietnamese authorities' policy of aggression is the root cause of the suffering of the Cambodian people. The key to completely resolving the Cambodian issue, including the refugee problem, is for Vietnam to genuinely withdraw all its troops from Cambodia. Therefore, the international community should exert further pressure on Vietnam to force it to fulfill its commitments and withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of September this year.

	Yu Meng Jia said that in recent times, with the efforts of ASEAN countries and other relevant parties, activities aimed at a political solution to the Cambodian issue have increased significantly. However, the Vietnamese authorities still lack genuine intent to withdraw their troops and have set up various obstacles to a comprehensive political solution for Cambodia, attempting to legalize the facts of their aggression.

### 我认捐五万美元援助柬难民  再次敦促越南九月底前从柬撤军

　　我认捐五万美元援助柬难民
    再次敦促越南九月底前从柬撤军
    本报联合国３月９日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国政府今天向联合国边境救济署认捐５万美元，用于救济泰国境内的柬埔寨难民。
    这是中国常驻联合国副代表俞孟嘉大使在援助柬埔寨捐助国会议上宣布的。会上已认捐的总数为１１００万美元。
    自越南军队在１９７８年侵占柬埔寨以来，约有３０万柬埔寨难民住在泰国边境内的难民营内。
    俞孟嘉强调，联合国承认民主柬埔寨为柬埔寨的合法政府，因此联合国机构为救济目的与金边机构的任何交往，只能在非官方一级进行。
    俞孟嘉指出，越南当局的侵略政策是造成柬埔寨人民苦难的根源。彻底解决柬埔寨问题，包括难民问题的关键是越南真正从柬埔寨全部撤军。因此，国际社会应对越南进一步施加压力，迫使它履行自己的承诺，于今年９月底以前从柬埔寨全部撤军。
    俞孟嘉说，最近一个时期，在东盟国家以及其它有关方面的努力下，政治解决柬埔寨问题的活动有了明显增加，但是，越南当局至今缺乏真正撤军的诚意，并为全面政治解决柬埔寨问题设置种种障碍，妄图使其侵略造成的事实合法化。
