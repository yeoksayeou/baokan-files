Ren Jianxin Discusses Optimizing the Law Enforcement Environment
Judicial Supervision Mechanism Becoming Stronger

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 18 — (Reporter Zhou Changxin) Ren Jianxin, President of the Supreme People's Court, said in an interview with this agency's reporter that China's judicial supervision mechanism is becoming increasingly robust, and a good law enforcement environment is taking shape.

Ren Jianxin, who has been serving as the President of the Supreme People's Court for a year, stated that he has been working in the legal field for over 40 years, but the sense of urgency in his work has never been as strong as it is now. He feels that the responsibility on his shoulders is heavy, and the supervisory and regulatory forces from various quarters have significantly strengthened.

Ren Jianxin said that as the awareness of supervision by people's representatives increases, the legislative supervisory functions of the People's Congress are also becoming stronger. However, various levels of courts still face some factors that hinder judicial work. If the quality of some judicial personnel is not high, it will be difficult to ensure that judgments are absolutely error-free. He believes that the key is to discover and correct errors in a timely manner. This requires supervision. Supervision comes from multiple sources, including higher courts' judicial supervision, the supervisory functions of legislative bodies, and the supervision by the people and public opinion. He said that this supervisory mechanism is becoming increasingly robust, which is exactly what we hope for.

Ren Jianxin said that to supervise, one must be informed. From the perspective of court work, only through open trials can true supervision be achieved. Open trials are an important principle stipulated by the Constitution of our country and are the core of court trials. Last year, the Supreme People's Court focused on the issue of open trials.

Ren Jianxin said that for courts to correctly exercise their judicial powers, in addition to strengthening supervision, it is also necessary to adhere to the constitutional principle of independent trials. However, some courts are sometimes interfered with in their judicial work, which shows that efforts to uphold independent trials in accordance with the law need to be continued.

　　任建新谈优化执法环境
    审判监督机制正趋强化
    据新华社北京３月１８日电  （记者周长新）最高人民法院院长任建新在此间接受本社记者访问时说，我国法院审判的监督机制日趋强化，一个较好的执法环境正在形成。
    就任最高人民法院院长已一年的这位中国首席大法官表示，他从事法律工作已４０多年，但工作紧迫感从来没有像现在这样强烈，因为他深感自己肩上的担子很重，同时来自各方面的对执法的监督制约力量也大大加强了。
    任建新说，随着人民代表监督意识的提高，人大的法律监督职能也日益强化。而由于各级法院还面临一些困扰和影响审判工作的因素，少数审判人员素质不高，就很难做到审判绝对不出一点错。他认为，关键是要及时发现错误，纠正错误。这就需要监督。监督是多方面的，既要有上级法院的审判监督，也要有权力机关的法律监督，还要有人民群众和社会舆论的监督。他说，这种监督机制正在日益强化，这正是我们所希望的。
    任建新说，要监督，就得知情。从法院工作来看，只有公开审判，才能真正接受监督。公开审判是我国宪法规定的一项重要原则，是法院审判活动的重心。去年最高人民法院着力抓了公开审判问题。
    任建新说，法院正确行使审判权，除了加强监督，还必须坚持独立审判的宪法原则。但有的法院在审判工作中，有时还受到干扰，这说明，坚持依法独立审判还需要继续作出努力。
