The 21st century is approaching, and it will be an era of rapid advancement in information technology and high technology. Those who fail to keep up will not only lag behind developing countries but may also struggle to secure a foothold even among developed nations.

Thus, the adage "prepare for the rain before it falls" is apt. Many industrialized countries are taking measures to adapt to educational challenges. In the United States, some advocate starting education from the age of three or four to ensure America maintains its edge on the 21st-century international economic stage. The "Economic Development Committee" of the United States has emphasized that without long-term planning and substantial investment in pre-school education, America will lack qualified workers to compete in the global economy in the coming years. No wonder President Bush declared himself the "Education President," stating, "When I look to the future, I believe that education is the answer."

French President Mitterrand, in his election manifesto "Letter to the French People" last year, also proclaimed that future national strength will depend more on intelligence than on financial resources. Therefore, education must be given the highest priority, with the education budget for 1989 increased by 3% to account for 18% of the government's budget.

Japan, known for its "education-based nation" policy, is currently undertaking its third major education reform since the Meiji Restoration. Prime Minister Takeshita in his policy speech stressed, "Promoting education reform is a national policy that must be pursued with all our might."

Other countries such as the Soviet Union, West Germany, Britain, and Australia are also conducting or preparing for educational reforms.

Clearly, any country aiming to secure a place in the grandeur of the 21st century must first strengthen its educational foundation.

In fact, from the invention of the steam engine by James Watt 200 years ago, which sparked the Industrial Revolution, to the modern era of nuclear and electronic technologies, every leap forward in human society has been closely tied to education. This is particularly evident in the United States and Japan. About a century ago, the British Empire was known as the "Empire on which the sun never sets," dominating the world unchallenged. However, its hegemony was eventually surpassed by its former American colony. The reason lies in America's superior technological and economic strength, both of which are built on education. Japan, since the Meiji Restoration, has transformed from a feudal, agrarian country into a modern industrial powerhouse. After its defeat in World War II, it created an economic miracle in the 20th century, becoming the world's second-largest economy. The reason? Former Japanese Education Minister Araki Manjiro aptly summarized it: "The main reason can be attributed to the widespread and advanced education system."

It is undeniable that all industrialized countries allocate a significant portion of their GDP and government budgets to education, with the United States and Japan being particularly notable.

However, to welcome the 21st century and maintain and enhance their respective advantages, the United States and Japan are not content with their current status. Particularly, the United States, under pressure from Japan's recent aggressive advances in technology and economy, views education reform as an urgent task. Recently, it announced the most ambitious education reform plan since the 1950s, known as the "2061 Education Reform Plan," aiming to completely overhaul the traditional teaching system and methods from kindergarten to high school, and cultivate a new workforce suited to the needs of the new era. Japan, on the other hand, believes that its mission to catch up with Western developed countries is "basically accomplished," and it is now moving towards an era of "innovation and leadership." Therefore, the Japanese government emphasized in its 1988 education white paper: "The basic approach to future education reform is to transition towards a lifelong learning system," to improve the overall quality of the nation and lay the foundation for the 21st century.

It is easy to imagine that with the arrival of the 21st century, human civilization will enter a brand new era.

### 未雨而绸缪

　　未雨而绸缪
    王士芳
    ２１世纪行将来临，这将是一个信息化和高科技突飞猛进的时代。谁跟不上趟，到时候，不仅落后国家，就连发达国家，也难以占有立锥之地。
    于是，“宜未雨而绸缪”，许多工业发达国家围绕教育问题各自采取应变措施。美国有人力主马上“从三四岁的娃娃教育抓起”，以使美国在２１世纪的国际经济舞台上保持优势。美国“经济发展委员会”发表的报告强调：如果不制定长期规划和对学龄前儿童的教育工作进行大量投资，那末在未来岁月中，美国将因缺乏合格工人而无法在世界经济中保持竞争地位。难怪布什总统表示要当“教育总统”。他说：“当我展望未来时，我认为只有教育才是答案”。
    法国密特朗总统在去年竞选总统时发表的《告法国人民书》中也宣称：将来，国力更多地是依靠智力而不是财力，所以，教育必须置于头等领先的地位，１９８９年教育经费仍提高３％，占政府预算的１８％。
    以“教育立国”的日本，现在正深入开展自明治维新以来的第三次教育改革。竹下登首相在施政演说中强调：“推进教育改革是必须全力以赴的国政。”
    其他国家如苏联、西德、英国和澳大利亚等国也都在或即将进行教育改革。
    可见，任何国家要在２１世纪的辉煌殿堂中争得一席之地，都必先固教育之本。
    其实，从２００年前瓦特发明蒸气机引起工业革命到进入现代的核能、电子时代，人类社会的每次跃进，又何尝离得开教育的作用。这一点，反映在美日两国身上最为明显。约一个世纪前，大不列颠帝国号称“日不落国”，称雄世界，不可一世。曾几何时，英帝国的霸主地位最终被其原在美洲的殖民地美国取而代之。究其因，美国在以教育为基础的科技和经济实力方面超过了英国。而日本从明治维新起，历时半个多世纪，从封建落后的农业国进化为现代工业强国；战败后，又从废墟瓦砾上创造出２０世纪的经济奇迹，成为当今世界第二经济大国。原因何在？日本前文部大臣荒木万寿夫答得好：“其主要原因可以归结为教育的普及和发达”。
    毋庸讳言，所有工业发达国家的教育经费在国民生产总值和政府预算中皆居要位，特别是美日两国更为突出。
    然而，为了迎接２１世纪，尽力保住并发扬各自的优势，美日两国不以此为满足，尤其是美国，迫于日本近年来在科技和经济两方面咄咄逼人的攻势，视教育改革为当务之急，于最近宣布一项５０年代以来最宏伟的名为“２０６１教改计划”，以彻底改变从幼儿园到高中的传统的教学体制和方法，培养适应新时代需要的新劳动力。而日本则认为“追赶欧美发达国家的使命已基本结束”，现在要迈向“首创和领先的文明开拓时代”。所以，日本政府在１９８８年的教育白皮书中强调：“今后教改的基本观点是设法向终身学习体制过渡”，以提高全民族的素质，为２１世纪奠定基础。
    不难想象，随着２１世纪的到来，人类文明必将进入一个崭新的时代。
