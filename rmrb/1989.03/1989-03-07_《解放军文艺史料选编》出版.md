The compilation of selected materials on the history of military arts is published. Following the instructions of Premier Zhou Enlai, who emphasized the importance of summarizing the military's arts work before his passing, the People's Liberation Army Academy of Arts has completed the first comprehensive historical work on the military's arts work, "Selected Materials on the History of the People's Liberation Army's Arts." After more than three years of arduous effort, this work has been published by the People's Liberation Army Press.

This compilation is divided into three parts covering the Red Army period, the Anti-Japanese War period, and the Liberation War period, totaling 8 volumes and approximately 300 million characters. The book includes articles and reports by senior revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yi, Deng Xiaoping, and Nie Rongzhen on military arts work during various historical periods, as well as recollections and writings by hundreds of arts figures. Additionally, it includes six plays from the Red Army period and a collection of rare historical photographs.
