The price of raw materials has been rising year after year, but the price of products from the Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory, which accounts for 40% of the domestic total production, has only been "slightly adjusted," yet profits and taxes have continued to increase. What is Lu Guanqiu's secret? Read on—

**Analysis of the "Universal Joint Phenomenon"**

A car has over 8,000 components. Experts estimate that, except for a few simple parts, the price increase of components in recent years has been between 50% and several times the original price. Consequently, car prices have also increased severalfold.

There are exceptions. The universal joints produced by the Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory have seen minimal price increases since 1982. For example, for the most widely used universal joints for the Liberation brand 5-ton truck, in 1980, they opened up the market with a factory price 20% lower than other factories (16 yuan); after 1982, they sold them at a government-set price of 18 yuan, unchanged for 7 years; at the beginning of this year, they only "slightly adjusted" the average price to 19 yuan. Currently, the factory price of various types of universal joints produced by this factory is generally lower than that of domestic counterparts.

During this period, the price of steel used by the factory has increased by 1.3 times; coal prices have increased by 5 times; and the annual salary of workers has increased from 507.50 yuan in 1979 to 3,000 yuan.

Despite this, the economic benefits of the Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory have continued to rise. In 1979, the factory created 200 million yuan in taxes and profits, and last year this increased to 1,045 million yuan.

Production costs have been rising year after year, while product prices have remained in a state of "slight adjustment" for many years—this phenomenon at the Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory can be tentatively called the "Universal Joint Phenomenon."

**The People of the Universal Joint Factory Discuss the "Universal Joint Phenomenon"**

The low-price sales of the Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory have long been the "target" of criticism from domestic counterparts. Last September, counterparts suggested a joint price increase, but Lu Guanqiu politely declined.

In making this decision, Lu Guanqiu had two main considerations: a strong sense of social responsibility. Now, many products are experiencing price increases, putting a lot of pressure on the country and the reforms; as a businessperson participating in fierce market competition, he also believes that raising product prices may reduce the "pressure" on the enterprise itself, but it is also easy to protect backwardness and create competitors.

The facts are indeed like this. The Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory's highest annual production was in 1988, reaching 2.5 million sets, accounting for about 40% of the domestic total production. This share plays a crucial role in the universal joint market. Their products not raising prices actually plays a role in stabilizing universal joint prices, causing many poorly managed universal joint factories to lose their "entry ticket" to the market and be forced to be eliminated. Also, because their universal joints' factory price is only equivalent to the cost of the automobile manufacturing plant, some automobile manufacturing plants have decided to gradually stop producing universal joints themselves and instead use those from the Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory for assembly.

**The Secret of the "Universal Joint Phenomenon"**

Economies of scale—from 70,000 sets to 2.5 million sets. This change in production volume occurred over 10 years, during which the number of workers increased from 400 to 1,151. The ratio of the increase in production volume to the increase in the number of workers is approximately 12:1, meaning that, under other unchanged production conditions, the efficiency of each worker has increased by 12 times.

According to a survey, in 1987, Zhejiang Province had over 600 township and village enterprises producing automobile parts, with an average of 32.6 workers per enterprise. The Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory pursues an appropriate scale of economies, making the best combination of workers and machinery, thereby achieving the goal of reducing the unit production cost of products.

Technological progress—depreciation period shortened from 15 years to 7 years. This move allows the Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory to invest at least 4 million yuan in technological upgrades each year, with the equipment newness index reaching 0.77. For example, they replaced the "M2110" type internal cylindrical grinder with the "MZ208" type, increasing the per-shift output from 300 to 1,000, and reducing the defect rate from 3.5% to 0.3%. The power consumption per 10,000 yuan of output value has decreased from 4,800 degrees in 1980 to 1,700 degrees in 1988.

"The Two Investments"—Lu Guanqiu believes that workers have a dual purpose in working for the enterprise: one is for the country's "four modernizations"; the other is to improve their own lives. Based on this, he proposed the concept of "two investments": one is "brain investment," doing a good job in ideological and political work, making it clear that only when the country is rich and the enterprise has high benefits can individuals gradually become rich, while at the same time improving the cultural knowledge level of workers, making them proficient in mastering advanced production technologies; the other is "pocket investment," when workers actively contribute labor to improve the enterprise's benefits, the enterprise should invest the corresponding remuneration into the workers' "pockets." The more labor contributed, the more should be invested into the "pocket." The "two investments" have mobilized the enthusiasm of workers. In 1988, the labor productivity per person increased from 8,087 yuan in 1979 to 35,627 yuan, and the tax and profit per person increased from 2,850 yuan to 9,215 yuan, ranking at the forefront of the domestic automobile parts industry.

**The "Universal Joint Phenomenon" Provokes Thought**

The "Universal Joint Phenomenon" has aroused great interest among many people in the economic and theoretical circles. They believe that the Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory's prices have been able to remain relatively stable for nearly 10 years, and this economic phenomenon provides a useful reference for the current "rectification and adjustment," price stabilization, and industrial structure adjustment.

There is a general consensus that we can learn from and apply some specific practices of the "Universal Joint Phenomenon" in our economic work. For example, in terms of capital investment, technological transformation, supply of raw materials, and power, we can consciously implement a "tilt policy," focusing on supporting some backbone enterprises to form enterprises with technological leadership, advanced management, a large market share, and obvious price advantages in the industry. The price scale can be set at the advanced level of the leading enterprises, thereby promoting economic structure adjustment and "forcing" enterprises to digest internally.

The Hangzhou Universal Joint Factory's tax rate is the same as that of state-owned enterprises, and it is not ruled out that relevant departments may give some preferential treatment because the factory has good benefits and is "famous." However, these intentional or unintentional preferential treatments have produced such significant economic and social benefits. Some experts propose that giving some preferential treatment to "leading enterprises" by the state will also yield significant social and economic benefits, which is a kind of "less investment, more output," and it is worth a try.

Different people see it differently. The "Universal Joint Phenomenon" provides many insights.

　　原材料价格连年上涨，占国内总产量４０％的杭州万向节厂的产品价格只作“微调”，而利税却照样增长。鲁冠球有何绝招，请读——  
    “万向节现象”剖析
    一辆汽车有８０００多个零部件。专家估计，除几个简单零件外，近几年来，零部件的涨价幅度在５０％到数倍不等，于是汽车价格也成倍上涨。
    也有例外。杭州万向节厂生产的万向节，从１９８２年以来，出厂价所涨幅度甚微。以批量最大的解放牌五吨卡车的万向节为例，１９８０年，他们以低于其他厂２０％的出厂价（１６元）打开销路；１９８２年后按部定价１８元出售，７年不变；今年初，他们仅“微调”到平均价１９元。目前，这个厂生产的各类万向节，其出厂价普遍低于国内同行厂。
    而在此期间，工厂使用的钢材提价１．３倍；煤提价５倍；职工年工资从１９７９年的５０７．５０元增加到３０００元。
    尽管如此，杭州万向节厂的经济效益仍直线上升。１９７９年，全厂创税利２００万元，去年已提高到１０４５万元。
    生产费用连年上涨，而产品价格数年只呈“微调”状态——发生在杭州万向节厂的这一现象，我们姑且称之为“万向节现象”。
    　　　　万向节人谈“万向节现象”
    杭州万向节厂低价销售，多年来成为全国同行厂的“众矢之的”。去年９月，同行厂建议联合提价，鲁冠球婉言谢绝。
    作此决策，鲁冠球的思路有二：出于强烈的社会责任感。现在许多产品轮番涨价，给国家、改革造成很大压力；而作为参与激烈市场竞争的企业家，他又认为，产品提价，企业自身虽然减了“压”，但也容易保护落后，给自己制造竞争对手。
    事实的确如此。杭州万向节厂的年产量最高的１９８８年已达２５０万套，占国内总产量的４０％左右。这一份额在万向节市场起着举足轻重的作用。他们的产品不提价，实际上就起了平抑万向节价格的作用，以致使不少管理不善的万向节厂失去了进入市场的“入场券”，被迫淘汰。也由于他们生产的万向节出厂价只相当于汽车制造厂的成本费用，一些汽车制造厂决定逐步停止自产万向节，改由杭州万向节厂配套。
    　　　　“万向节现象”的奥秘
    规模效益——从７万套到２５０万套。这一产量的变化是１０年间发生的，同期的工人数从４００人增加到１１５１人，产量的增加数与工人的增加数之比约为１２∶１，也就是说，在其他生产条件不计的情况下，每个职工的效益提高了１２倍。
    据调查，１９８７年，浙江省有乡镇企业汽车配件厂６００多家，平均每家工人３２．６人。杭州万向节厂追求适宜的规模效益，使操作工人与机器设备的利用实行了最佳组合，从而达到降低单位产品生产成本的目的。
    技术进步——折旧率从１５年缩短到７年。此举使杭州万向节厂每年至少有４０余万元投入技改，使设备新度系数达到０．７７。例如，他们用“ＭＺ２０８”型内圆磨床代替“Ｍ２１１０”型，使每人班产从３００只上升到１０００只，废品率从３．５％下降到０．３％。万元产值的耗电度已从１９８０年的４８００度下降到１９８８年１７００度。
    “两袋投入”——鲁冠球认为，职工在企业劳动有双重目的：一是为国家“四化”；二是为改善自己的生活。据此，他提出了“两袋投入”的说法：一是“脑袋投入”，做好思想政治工作，使之明确只有国家富，企业效益高，个人才能逐步富起来，与此同时还要提高职工的文化知识水平，使之熟练掌握先进生产技术；二是“口袋投入”，当工人积极为提高企业效益付出了劳动时，企业应向职工“口袋”投入相应的报酬。付出劳动越大，投入“口袋”的应越多。“两袋投入”调动了职工积极性。１９８８年，全员劳动生产率从１９７９年的８０８７元提高到３５６２７元，人均创税利从２８５０元提高到９２１５元，在国内汽车配件行业名列前茅。
    　　　　“万向节现象”发人深思
    “万向节现象”已引起许多经济界、理论界人士的浓厚兴趣。他们认为，杭州万向节厂的价格近１０年来能保持相对稳定，这一经济现象，为当前的“治理、整顿”，稳定物价和调整产业结构提供了有益的参考。
    比较一致的意见是，我们在经济工作中可以借鉴、应用“万向节现象”的一些具体做法。如在资金投向、技术改造、供应原材料、电力能源等方面，有意识地实行“倾斜政策”，着力扶持某些骨干企业，形成技术领先，管理先进，产品占有较大市场份额，价格优势明显的“行业导向厂”，把制定价格的标尺订在导向厂的先进水平上，以此促进经济结构调整，“强制”企业内部消化。
    杭州万向节厂的税收与全民企业同一个比率，当然不排除有关方面因为工厂效益好、“名气大”而给予的某些优惠。而这些有意无意间的优惠，却产生了如此大的经济效益和社会效益，一些专家提出，国家给“导向企业”一些优惠，却会收到很大的社会效益和经济效益，这也是一种“少投入，多产出”，不妨一试。
    仁者见仁，智者见智。“万向节现象”给人的启示是多方面的。
