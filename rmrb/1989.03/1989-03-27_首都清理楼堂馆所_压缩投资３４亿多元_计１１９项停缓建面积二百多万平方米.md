Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 26th. According to data provided by the Beijing Municipal Commission of Urban Planning yesterday, the capital has cleared out 119 mansions and halls, halting or delaying construction on 2,315,000 square meters of space, and reducing construction investment by 3.46 billion yuan. This alone accounts for 25.1% of the fixed asset investment scale in the capital last year.

Among these halted or delayed projects, 20 were voluntarily cleared by central government agencies and local enterprises in the capital, reducing investment by approximately 470 million yuan. In the first quarter of this year, new construction projects in the capital accounted for only about 20% of the same period last year. The approved annual new construction projects total 5,500,000 square meters, a reduction of 38.9% compared to last year.

The responsible official stated that the Beijing Municipal Commission of Urban Planning, from the perspective of overall rectification and order, has properly addressed the issue of some construction units being "underfed"; reallocated construction forces, and ensured the timely, high-quality, and high-standard completion of key projects in the capital. Projects such as the Asian Games, color picture tube, and Tian Tan Hospital, among 23 key projects, will be completed on schedule.

　　首都清理楼堂馆所　压缩投资３４亿多元        
    计１１９项停缓建面积二百多万平方米
    据新华社北京３月２６日电  （实习生杨兴国）北京市建委昨天提供的数据表明，首都已清理楼堂馆所１１９项，停缓建面积达２３１．５万平方米，压缩基建投资３４．６亿元，仅此一项，占去年首都固定资产基建投资规模的２５．１％。
    在这些停缓建项目中，有２０个是首都的一些中央机关和地方企业主动清理的，压缩投资约４．７亿元。今年一季度，首都新开工基建项目仅占去年同期的２０％左右。审批的全年新开工基建项目５５０万平方米，比去年压缩３８．９％。
    这位负责人介绍说，北京市建委从治理整顿的大局出发，妥善解决部分施工单位“吃不饱”的问题；重新调整施工力量，确保首都重点工程。亚运会工程、彩色显像管工程、天坛医院等２３项重点工程，将如期保质保量建成。
