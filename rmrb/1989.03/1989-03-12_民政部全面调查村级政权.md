The Ministry of Civil Affairs has conducted a comprehensive survey of village-level governance. According to reports from Beijing on March 11 by reporters Zheng De Gang and Zhu Si Xiong, out of the more than 840,000 village committees currently in rural areas across the country, a significant number are in a state of disarray, directly affecting the implementation and development of various rural tasks at present.

In response to the issues in rural grassroots governance, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has dispatched 168 officials from its headquarters and the Civil Affairs Management Academy, forming 29 working groups. These groups will depart by March 12 to conduct surveys in 15 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including Tianjin, Jiangsu, Henan, Gansu, and Guizhou, with the aim of proposing improvement measures.
