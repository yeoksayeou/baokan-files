Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 15th - "The current danger in the Cambodian issue is the attempt by the Hun Sen-Heng Samrin regime to seize power alone. We firmly oppose this. To resolve the Cambodian issue, a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk must be established. Otherwise, peace in Cambodia will be difficult to achieve." These remarks were made by State Chairman Yang Shangkun this afternoon when he met with Thai Prime Minister Chatichai in the Great Hall of the People.

Chairman Yang said that the Cambodian issue is currently on the verge of resolution. Chatichai's visit to China at this time to exchange views with Chinese leaders is of great significance in promoting the resolution of the Cambodian issue.

Chatichai said that Thailand regards China as a close ally and is willing to exchange views with China on major issues. When discussing the Cambodian issue, he said, "Thailand wants to turn the battlefield into a market. However, the prerequisite is that Vietnam must withdraw all its troops from Cambodia. Thailand cannot allow armed people to enter the market. The policy of the Thai government is firm: Vietnam must withdraw all its troops from Cambodia, and the future government of Cambodia must be led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk."

Chatichai warmly invited Chairman Yang to visit Thailand. Chairman Yang accepted the invitation with pleasure, and the specific time will be determined later.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 15th - "Every time I come to Beijing, if I haven't seen Elder Sister, I feel incomplete," Thai Prime Minister Chatichai said this afternoon when he met with Deng Yingchao in the West Flower Hall of Zhongnanhai.

"We are old friends," Deng Yingchao said. "This is your first visit to China since becoming Prime Minister. I am very happy to see you and your wife. You have made many contributions to the development of Sino-Thai friendship. I know you are still working hard for this." Chatichai told Deng Yingchao that he was visiting as both Prime Minister and Chairman of the Thai-China Friendship Association. "According to custom, I should resign from the position of Chairman of the Thai-China Friendship Association, but I will not resign." "This is a very friendly gesture," Deng Yingchao said, specially taking out a photograph of her visit to Thailand in 1980 with Chatichai and his wife to show to Chatichai and his wife. Finally, she asked Chatichai to convey her best wishes to the King and Queen of Thailand.

Chatichai's wife and daughter also participated in the meeting.

　　杨尚昆邓颖超分别会见差猜
    本报北京三月十五日讯  记者温宪报道：“当前柬埔寨问题中现实的危险是韩桑林—洪森政权企图单独掌权。对此，我们坚决反对。解决柬埔寨问题，必须成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。否则，柬国内和平就很难实现。”这番话是国家主席杨尚昆今天下午在人民大会堂会见泰国总理差猜时说的。
    杨主席说，当前柬埔寨问题正酝酿着解决。差猜总理在这个时候访华，同中国领导人交换意见，对推动柬问题的解决有重要意义。
    差猜总理说，泰国把中国看成是一个亲密的友邦，愿意就一些重大问题同中国交换意见。在谈到柬埔寨问题时，他说，泰国想把战场变成市场。但先决条件是越南必须从柬全部撤军。泰国不能让背着枪的人进入市场。泰国政府的政策是坚定的：越南必须从柬全部撤军，未来的柬埔寨政府必须以西哈努克亲王为首。
    差猜总理热情邀请杨主席访问泰国。杨主席欣然接受邀请，具体时间以后商定。
    本报北京三月十五日讯　“我每次到北京来，如果没能会见大姐，就感到不圆满。”泰国总理差猜今天下午在中南海西花厅见到邓颖超后这样说。
    “我们是老朋友了，”邓颖超说，“这次是你担任总理以后第一次访华。我对你和你夫人的到来很高兴。你在发展中泰友谊上做出了很多贡献。我知道你还在为此而努力。”差猜告诉邓颖超他这次是以总理和泰中友协主席双重身份来访问的，“按照惯例，我应该辞去泰中友协主席的职务，但是我不辞。”“这是你十分友好的表示”邓颖超说着，特地将一九八○年访泰时与差猜夫妇合影的照片拿给差猜总理和夫人看。最后，她请差猜总理转达对泰国国王和王后的良好祝愿。
    差猜总理的夫人和女儿等参加了会见。
