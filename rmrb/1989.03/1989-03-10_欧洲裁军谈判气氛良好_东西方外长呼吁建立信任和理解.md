Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, March 8th.

The three-day opening ceremony of the European conventional arms negotiations and the talks on building confidence and security measures in Europe concluded successfully today at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. The gathering and speeches by the foreign ministers of the East and West injected strong political momentum into the two upcoming negotiations, marking a good beginning to "overcome European divisions, eliminate the threat of war, and build trust and understanding."

In his closing speech, Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock pointed out that Europe currently concentrates the largest conventional military forces in human history. Therefore, establishing a low-level, stable military balance in this region is crucial. The 35 countries of the CSCE share a common responsibility for Europe's military security, and the convening of the European conventional arms negotiations is of great significance for the new development of East-West relations.

He said that although the conventional arms reduction plans announced by the Warsaw Pact and NATO are not entirely the same, they are consistent in eliminating the existing imbalance in conventional arms, significantly reducing troops and conventional weapons, and transforming the organizational structure of conventional arms into a defensive nature.

Mock also called on the participating countries to further enhance transparency in building confidence and security measures, openly sharing information about their military organizations, forces, deployment locations, and regions. He suggested exchanging basic military strategies to expand mutual trust. He also proposed that Vienna be used as the venue for future monitoring of the implementation of the comprehensive chemical weapons ban treaty.

Mock said that Europe's peace requires the establishment of a security community filled with understanding and the non-use of force to resolve disputes. The greatest task of the two upcoming plans for disarmament and building confidence measures in Vienna is to create a Europe that coexists peacefully without threats and fears. He also hoped that the two major military blocs of the East and West would strengthen communication and consultation with neutral and non-aligned countries during the negotiations. The foreign ministers of Italy, Yugoslavia, Sweden, the Netherlands, San Marino, Liechtenstein, Cyprus, Morocco, and Greece also spoke at the final day's plenary session.

　　欧洲裁军谈判气氛良好
    东西方外长呼吁建立信任和理解
    新华社维也纳３月８日电  历时３天的欧洲常规军备谈判和欧洲建立信任和安全措施谈判开幕式今天在维也纳霍夫堡宫圆满结束。东西方外长的聚会和发言为即将开始的两个谈判注入了强有力的政治动力，成为“克服欧洲分裂，消除战争威胁，建立信任和理解”的良好开端。
    奥地利外长莫克在闭幕会议的发言中指出，欧洲目前集中了人类历史上最庞大的常规军力，因此在此地区建立低水平的稳定的军事均势是至关重要的。欧安会３５国对欧洲的军事安全负有共同的责任，欧洲常规军备谈判的举行对东西方关系的新发展具有重大意义。
    他说，尽管华约和北约各自宣布的常规裁军方案不尽相同，但彼此在消除现有常规军备不平衡状况、大幅度裁减军队及常规武器及将常规军备的组织结构改为防御性质等方面都是一致的。
    莫克还要求与会国在建立信任和安全措施方面进一步加强透明度，公开各自军事组织、兵力、驻扎地点和区域等方面的情况，并应就彼此的基本军事战略进行交流，以扩大信任度。他还提议把维也纳作为今后监督全面禁止化学武器条约执行情况的场所。
    莫克说，欧洲的和平要求人们建立一个充满理解、不使用武力解决争端的安全共同体。即将开始的维也纳裁军和建立信任措施的两个计划的最大任务就是要建立一个没有威胁和恐惧的和平共处的欧洲。他同时还希望东西方两大军事集团在谈判过程中加强同中立及不结盟国家的通报和协商。意大利、南斯拉夫、瑞典、荷兰、圣马力诺、列支敦士登、塞浦路斯、摩洛哥以及希腊等国的外长也先后在最后一天的大会上发了言。
