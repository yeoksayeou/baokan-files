		Commercial Awareness Penetrates into Primary School Students
		Some People Believe This is a Normal Social Phenomenon
		Educators Appeal: Do Not Let Money Corrupt Young Minds

		Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, March 2 (Correspondent Wang Yujuan, Reporter Zheng Zhanguo) The reporter investigated 10 primary schools in Tangshan City and found that 9 of them had students engaging in commercial activities. Some students help their parents run businesses during their spare time, while others sell small items to earn pocket money. Before the Spring Festival, a third-grade student was found hiring classmates to sell New Year's cards, paying a commission of 5 fen per card sold.

		The commercial activities of primary school students are generally sporadic, occurring only when there are opportunities and conditions. Regular activities are less common.

		One primary school assigned students to write an essay titled "My Dream." Nearly a quarter of the students expressed a desire to become individual business owners in the future, stating that they could both make money and serve the public.

		A member of the city's Youth League Committee introduced that some primary school students have already learned to use the "commodity exchange principle" to provide "paid services": copying someone's homework requires a few pieces of chocolate as payment; helping someone write an essay requires a few jiao as a reward. Such phenomena are not uncommon.

		The commercial awareness of primary school students comes from various influences. Some students' parents are individual business owners, and their conversations and actions revolve around making money, naturally influencing their children. Some teachers also sell textbooks, stationery, and food, which affects the students. A 9-year-old student on the south side of Culture North Street in Nanqu District received a spring scale as a birthday gift. His father said, "Your father is incompetent. Others watch color TVs, but we watch black-and-white ones. When you grow up, go into business and make a lot of money!"

		Some people believe that the greatest achievement of China's decade-long reform is transforming a product economy into a planned commodity economy. It is natural for primary school students, who live in society, to have some commercial awareness. As long as they are educated to abide by the law and not harm others for personal gain, it is acceptable.

		However, more educators believe that childhood and adolescence are periods of acquiring knowledge and growing physically. Regardless of the policies implemented in society, they must be educated in communist ideals and the aspiration to become talented individuals. They appeal: Do not let money corrupt the pure and innocent minds of children.

### 商品意识渗入小学生  有些人认为这是正常的社会现象  教育工作者呼吁别让金钱玷污幼小心灵

    商品意识渗入小学生
    有些人认为这是正常的社会现象
    教育工作者呼吁别让金钱玷污幼小心灵
    新华社石家庄3月2日电　（通讯员王玉娟、记者郑战国）记者在唐山市调查了10所小学，发现9所小学学生有经商活动，有的是利用课余时间帮助父母经营，有的是自己卖点小东西挣零用钱。春节前还发现一个三年级小学生雇同学卖贺年片，卖一张给“提成”5分钱。
    小学生的经商活动一般带有偶然性，有机会、有条件时就突然“来”一次，经常性的还不多见。
    一所小学以《我的理想》为题让学生作文，近1／4的学生在作文里表示，愿意将来去当个体户，“既挣了钱，又方便群众”。
    团市委的同志介绍，一些小学生已经懂得利用“商品交换原则”搞“有偿服务”：你抄我的作业，要拿出几块巧克力为代价；我帮你写作文，要给几角钱作报酬。这类现象屡见不鲜。
    小学生的商品意识来自多方面的影响。有的学生家长是个体户，说的、干的都是如何赚钱，孩子自然受到熏陶；一些老师兼卖课本、文具和食品，也影响了学生。路南区文化北后街一个9岁小学生，得到的生日礼物是一根弹簧秤，他父亲说：“你爸爸无能，别人看彩电，咱家看黑白的，等你长大了，去经商吧，可以赚大钱！”
    有人认为，我国十年改革最大的成就是把产品经济变成了有计划的商品经济。小学生生活在社会上，有一些商品意识，是很正常的现象，只要教育他们遵纪守法、别损人利己就行了。
    更多的教育工作者则认为，少年儿童是长知识、长身体的时期，不论社会上实行什么政策，对他们必须进行共产主义思想和立志成才的教育。他们呼吁：千万别让金钱玷污了孩子们幼小、纯洁的心灵。
