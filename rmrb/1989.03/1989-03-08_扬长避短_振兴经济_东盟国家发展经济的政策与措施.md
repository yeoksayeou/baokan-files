In early 1988, economists were optimistic about the economic growth rate of developing countries, estimating it at no more than 3.6%. However, the actual growth rates of ASEAN countries in 1988 far exceeded this figure: Singapore reached 10.9%, the Philippines 7.54%, Thailand around 10%, Malaysia 7.4%, and even the lowest, Indonesia, surpassed 4%. All of these countries achieved their highest growth rates in recent years.

The achievements of ASEAN countries over the past year are closely linked to their policies and measures, which were implemented based on their actual situations, seizing opportunities, leveraging strengths, and avoiding weaknesses. These include:

1. **Accelerating the Introduction of Foreign Capital**: Since 1987, countries and regions such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan have seen a significant increase in their foreign exchange reserves and have been actively investing abroad. ASEAN countries have seized this opportunity to attract these investments. Externally, they have utilized collective dialogues or international conferences to engage with investing countries, while also dispatching government officials to lobby abroad. Internally, they have focused on stabilizing the political situation, creating a favorable investment environment, and offering preferential treatments to foreign investors, such as allowing sole foreign ownership, tax exemptions, and opening domestic markets to foreign enterprises. For instance, Indonesia has simplified investment approval procedures and lifted restrictions on financial services, allowing foreign banks to establish branches outside Jakarta and foreign ships to transport goods between Indonesian islands. These measures have significantly accelerated the inflow of foreign capital into ASEAN countries. In 1988, Indonesia attracted $4.4 billion in foreign investment, more than three times the amount in 1987. Thailand received $6 billion in foreign investment applications in the first ten months alone. Malaysia received $3.3 billion in foreign investment applications in the first half of the year, and the Philippines set a 20-year record for attracting foreign investment. The influx of foreign capital has brought in new technologies, promoted the production of certain original products, solved part of the employment problem, and opened up new production sectors.

2. **Actively Developing Labor-Intensive Industries**: In recent years, Japan has been promoting its technological division of labor in the Asia-Pacific region. As Japanese industries shift towards technology-intensive sectors, some labor-intensive industries have been relocated abroad, primarily to ASEAN countries. This aligns with the advantages of ASEAN countries, which have abundant cheap labor, raw materials, and markets, and also meets the aspirations of ASEAN countries to change their export product structure. Therefore, labor-intensive industries have developed rapidly in these countries. In 1988, the proportion of these products in the total export products increased significantly. Malaysia's electronics exports reached $6.2 billion, becoming the largest foreign exchange earner. Textile exports accounted for a significant portion of Thailand's exports. Indonesia's garment exports alone earned $1.5 billion. In 1988, Indonesia's non-oil product exports for the first time exceeded oil and natural gas exports, which is related to the development of labor-intensive industries. The entry of labor-intensive industries into ASEAN countries is changing their production structure and injecting vitality into their economies.

3. **Driving Economic Development Through Exports**: The currencies of ASEAN countries are either directly or indirectly pegged to the US dollar. In recent years, they have utilized the devaluation of the US dollar to their advantage for exports, as well as the favorable factors of rising prices for certain primary products, to expand exports. In terms of export products, ASEAN countries have ensured the continued export of traditional products while striving to open up new varieties and increase export quantities. Indonesia's exports of fish, shrimp, tea, and other products have all increased by hundreds of millions of dollars. Thailand's integrated circuit products, canned fish, gemstones, and other products have also seen significant growth. In addition to maintaining traditional markets in the US, Japan, and Europe, countries like Indonesia and Malaysia have also tried to expand exports to China and Eastern European countries. Through these efforts, the export volumes of these countries have all seen significant growth. Thailand's exports increased by 35%, Indonesia's foreign exchange earnings increased by over $7 billion, and Malaysia's exports in the first half of the year increased by 25% compared to the same period in 1987.

4. **Emphasizing the Development of Tourism**: Tourism has long been a significant foreign exchange earner for Singapore and Thailand. In recent years, Indonesia and Malaysia have also increasingly focused on developing tourism. In 1988, Singapore received over 4 million tourists, earning over $2 billion in foreign exchange. Thailand's annual tourism revenue reached $2.5 billion, a 20% increase from the previous year. Indonesia also received over 1.3 million tourists, earning over $1 billion in foreign exchange.

Looking at the current situation, the economies of ASEAN countries are expected to maintain stable growth in 1989. However, there are also factors constraining economic development. First, primary products still account for a significant proportion of exports, and fluctuations in their prices are crucial for the economic development of these countries. Second, the burden of external debt is becoming increasingly heavy. In June of last year, the Indonesian government acknowledged owing over $38 billion in external debt, with this year's repayment and interest payments expected to account for over 30% of export earnings. The Philippines also owes over $28 billion in external debt, which is undoubtedly a heavy burden.

### 扬长避短　振兴经济——东盟国家发展经济的政策与措施

　　扬长避短　振兴经济
    ——东盟国家发展经济的政策与措施
    １９８８年初经济学家们对发展中国家经济增长率最乐观的估计也仅３．６％，但东盟各国去年的实际增长率远远超过了这一数字：新加坡达１０．９％，菲律宾为７．５４％，泰国１０％左右，马来西亚７．４％，最低的印尼也超过了４％。都创造了近几年来最高速度。
    一年来，东盟各国取得的上述成就，是与这些国家根据本国实际情况抓住时机，注意扬长避短，发挥自己的优势，采取各种行之有效的政策和措施分不开的。其中包括：
    一、加快外资引进速度。自１９８７年以来，日本、南朝鲜、台湾等国家和地区的外汇储备急剧增加，对外投资活动积极。东盟各国不失时机地千方百计争取这些资本投入各自国家。对外，一方面利用集体对话或国际会议对投资国做工作；另一方面又派政府要员出国游说。对内则致力于稳定政局，创造良好的投资环境，给外资优厚待遇，如准许外资独资经营，减免税收，向外资企业开放国内市场等。其中印尼除简化投资审批手续外，还取消了对金融业务的管制，允许外国银行在雅加达以外地区设立分支机构，外国轮船可在印尼岛间运输等。这些措施大大加快了外资投向东盟各国的步伐。１９８８年印尼吸收外资达４４亿美元，是１９８７年的３倍多；泰国头１０个月就有６０亿美元的外资申请；马来西亚去年上半年也收到３３亿美元外资的申请；而菲律宾也创造了２０年来引进外资的最高纪录。外资大量涌入东盟国家，带来了新技术，促进了某些原产品的生产，解决了部分就业问题，开辟了新的生产领域。
    二、积极发展劳动密集型产业。近几年，日本有意在亚太地区推行其技术分工的设想，因此，随着日本产业向科技密集型转换，一些劳动密集型产业输往国外，主要是东盟各国。这正适应了东盟国家有廉价劳动力、原料和市场的优势，也符合东盟各国改变出口产品结构的愿望。因此，劳动密集型产业在这些国家发展很快。去年这些产品在整个出口产品中所占比例大幅度提高。１９８８年马来西亚电子产品出口已达６２亿美元，成为创汇最多的部门。纺织品的出口在泰出口商品中已成大宗。印尼仅成衣出口就创汇１５亿美元。１９８８年印尼非石油产品出口第一次超过石油、天然气出口，这和劳动密集型产业的发展有关。劳动密集型产业进入东盟各国正改变着它们的生产结构，给这些国家的经济注入了活力。
    三、以出口带动经济发展。东盟国家的货币多直接或间接与美元挂钩，近年来它们利用了美元贬值有利于出口这一时机，以及某些初级产品价格回升的有利因素扩大出口。在出口产品方面，东盟国家除确保传统产品继续出口外，还尽力开辟新的品种、增加出口数量，印尼的鱼、虾、茶等出口值都有上亿美元的增加。泰国的集成电路产品、罐头鱼、宝石等也有大幅度的增长。除保住美、日、欧等传统市场外，印尼、马来西亚等国还力图扩大对中国和东欧国家的出口。经过努力，去年这些国家的出口额都有明显增长。泰国年增３５％，印尼年增外汇７０多亿美元，马来西亚仅上半年就较１９８７年同期增２５％。
    四、重视发展旅游业。旅游早已成为新加坡和泰国的创汇项目。近年来印尼和马来西亚也越来越重视发展旅游业。１９８８年新加坡接待游客４００多万人次，创汇２０多亿美元，泰国全年旅游收入达２５亿美元，较前年增２０％，印尼也已接待游客１３０多万，创汇达１０多亿美元。
    就目前形势看，１９８９年东盟各国的经济仍将继续保持稳定增长的势头，但也有一些制约经济发展的因素。一是由于初级产品在出口产品中仍占较大比重，这些产品的价格波动对上述国家经济发展至关重要。二是外债负担日益沉重。去年６月，印尼官方已承认积欠３８０多亿美元外债，今年还本付息额将占出口额的３０％以上。菲律宾也积欠２８０多亿美元的外债，这无疑是其沉重的包袱。
