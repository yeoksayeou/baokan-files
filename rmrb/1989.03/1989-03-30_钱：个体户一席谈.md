Money: A Conversation with an Individual Entrepreneur

	“Where did the money go?” he retorted, then casually patted his pocket: “It’s right here.”

	“You ask why I don’t deposit it in the bank, but I ask why should I? Depositing money in a bank has to have some benefit. Insurance? Convenience? Interest? Insurance seems fine, but the chances of something happening are slim, why would it happen to me? As for convenience, that’s not the case. In my line of work, if I have a hot item, one telegram or long-distance call, and I have to rush out early in the morning. If you go to the bank to withdraw money, and it’s closed or on break, or they’re having a study session, it’s all wasted time. Even if the bank is open, they often don’t have enough cash on hand. What do you do then? Just worry. Plus, you have to deal with the teller’s attitude, like you’re not withdrawing your own money, but asking the bank for it. As for interest, forget about it. That’s not real money. To be honest, these days, ten thousand or twenty thousand isn’t much. Before, when I first made some money, I thought about depositing it in the bank, and I did deposit some, even some fixed-term deposits. Now I don’t. No, it’s not to expand my business. Making it big isn’t good; it attracts too much attention. Our country doesn’t encourage that. Being able to maintain the status quo is fine. Keeping the money on hand is less trouble and more comfortable.

	Speaking of which, now whether it’s buying or selling, everyone uses cash. No one wants to use checks or transfers, it’s too much trouble. Not just individuals, collective and state-owned enterprises are the same, they all welcome cash payments, and even give you a discount, up to about 10%. Anyway, there are 100-yuan bills now, and three to five thousand yuan is just a bundle, you can take it and go, it’s convenient.

	“I don’t want to expand the business anymore. Eating and drinking a bit, living a decent life is enough. A cup of foreign liquor at the Li Du (hotel) is 200 yuan. Even a cheap dance ticket is 80 to 100 yuan, spending a thousand or eight hundred yuan in one night is nothing. That’s nothing, it’s a small matter. Gambling? I don’t touch that, that’s not a good thing.

	“And... well... how should I say it. As long as you promise not to reveal my name, I trust you. To be honest, being an individual entrepreneur really isn’t for humans. Who said it? I remember it was written in a book; individual entrepreneurs have ‘two grandfathers and eight fathers,’ that’s right. Two grandfathers, one is the Industrial and Commercial Bureau, the other is the Tax Bureau. Eight fathers are the Public Security, Traffic, Price, Measurement, Sanitation, Food Hygiene, Urban Construction, and Street Office. If they say fine you, you have to pay. Not pay? They’ll make sure you can’t even get through the day. Don’t joke around, where would I go to complain? Who would listen? Just let out a bit of steam and it’s over. Otherwise, it’s like fighting against yourself.

	“Look, all of these need cash...””

	(Reporter: This individual entrepreneur and the few other individual entrepreneurs interviewed by the reporter, although their narratives differ and their business scopes are different, their meanings are largely the same; and it seems that they all have a considerable amount of cash on hand. Interestingly: when talking about paying taxes, they either avoid the topic or speak vaguely, which is also largely the same. Relevant data shows: there are many individual entrepreneurs who evade taxes. Not passing money through the bank to a large extent is for this purpose.

	According to relevant sources, by the end of 1988, there were about 14.5 million individual entrepreneurs nationwide. Even if each has an average of a few thousand yuan in cash, it is enough to constitute a considerable figure.)

### 钱：个体户一席谈

　　钱：个体户一席谈
    “钱哪儿去了？”他反问一句，又潇洒地拍拍腰包：“在这儿呢。”
    “您问为什么不存银行，那我要问为什么存银行？存银行总得图点儿什么。保险？方便？利息？保险好象没问题，出意外的可能性还不大，干嘛就偏偏轮到我头上？方便可说不上。干我这行当的，有俏货了，一个电报一个长途（电话），起早贪黑拔腿就得去奔命。你要现去银行取款，碰上下班、休息，还有学习什么的，就全耽误了。就算开门营业，动不动就没那么多现金，你怎么办？干着急。再说还得看营业员的脸子，好象你不是取自己的钱，倒是跟银行要钱似的。要说利息，更别提了，那算不上钱。说实在的，这年头一万两万的都算不上回事儿。以前刚赚了钱，还想存银行，也存了一些，定期的也有。现在不存了。不，不是扩大生意。弄大了没好处，太招人；咱国家也不兴这个。能维持现状就行。钱放在手边，省心省事，心里也舒服。
    话说回来，现在不管进货出货都用现金，谁也不愿用支票转帐，麻烦。不光个体，集体和国营企业也一样，照样欢迎付现金，还给你优惠，高的能优惠到１０％左右。反正有一百块一张的票子了，三五万块也就那么一扎，装上就走，好说。
    “生意是不想再往大弄了。吃点喝点，日子过得像点样儿也就行了。丽都（饭店）一杯洋酒就是二百块。舞会票便宜的也得百八十元，玩一晚上千儿八百块根本打不住。这是小意思，不算啥。赌博？咱不沾，那不是好事儿。
    “还有……嗯……怎么说呢。反正你保证不把我名字说出去，我信得过您。说实在的，这个体户也真不是人干的。那是谁说的？记得是书上写的；个体户有‘两个爷爷八个爹’，这话没错。两个爷爷，一是工商，一是税务。八个爹是公安、交通、物价、计量、环卫、食品卫生、城建、街道办事处。说罚款，谁伸手你都得给。不给？让你连今天都过不去。您别逗了，我上哪告去？谁管呐。捅点儿掖点儿气就顺了。要不那是和自个过不去。
    “您瞧瞧，这不都得要现钱吗？……”
    （记者：这位个体户和记者采访的其他几位个体户虽然叙述方式各异、经营范围不同，但意思大同小异；并且，看来手头现金都颇绰。有趣的是：谈到交税时，他们或避而不谈，或闪烁其辞，也是大同小异。有关资料表明：个体户中逃税漏税者不少。收支不经过银行，在很大程度上是为了这个目的。
    据有关人士介绍，到１９８８年底，全国共有个体经营者１４５０万户左右。他们手中拥有的现金即使平均每户三几千元，也足以构成一个可观的数字了。）
