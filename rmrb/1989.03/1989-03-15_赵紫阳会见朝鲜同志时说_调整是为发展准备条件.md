Zhao Ziyang Meets with North Korean Comrades, Says Adjustment is Preparing Conditions for Development

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 14 - Reporter Wen Xian reports: "We are prepared to spend two years or more, at the cost of slowing down the pace, to solve two problems: first, to further adjust the economic structure, and second, to explore new macro-control methods after the economy is activated through reform, to avoid the situation of chaos when relaxed and stagnation when controlled that has repeatedly occurred in the past." This was said by CCP Central Committee General Secretary Zhao Ziyang this afternoon when he met with Kim Jong-ryeong, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and a secretary of the Party Central Committee, in Zhongnanhai.

	Kim Jong-ryeong introduced the achievements of North Korea's socialist construction and the issue of North-South relations.

	Zhao Ziyang wished North Korea greater achievements in its future socialist construction. He said: "Our party has always supported the struggle of the Korean people for the independent and peaceful reunification of their country, and the various proposals and reasonable suggestions put forward by the Workers' Party of Korea and Chairman Kim Il-sung for reunification."

	In discussing China's reform, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang said, in general, the past ten years can be considered a decade of great development. Various undertakings, including the economy and culture, have indeed made significant progress, and the pace of reform has been substantial. After ten years of rapid development, noticeable inflation emerged last year. Now, we need to ease the situation. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee last year, we have implemented tight monetary and fiscal policies, and the pace of economic development has started to slow down. Prices have also begun to stabilize, and the overall situation is good. It can be said that the decisions of the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee have begun to show results. However, our tasks of economic structural adjustment and macro-control are still very arduous. If we can truly solve the above two problems, then the price paid will be worthwhile. This way, not only will we be able to fully consolidate the achievements of the past ten years of reform, but it will also be a preparation for further reform and development in the future.

	Department Head of the International Liaison Department of the CCP, Zhu Liang, was present at the meeting.

	Comrade Kim Jong-ryeong arrived in Beijing at noon on March 13.

### 赵紫阳会见朝鲜同志时说  调整是为发展准备条件

　　赵紫阳会见朝鲜同志时说
    调整是为发展准备条件
    本报北京３月１４日讯  记者温宪报道：“我们准备花两年或者更多的时间以降低速度为代价来解决两个问题：一是进一步进行经济结构调整，二是探讨改革把经济放活以后，如何采取新的宏观调控办法，避免过去曾反复出现的一放就乱，一管就死的状况”。这是中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天下午在中南海会见朝鲜劳动党中央政治局委员、党中央书记许锬时说的。
    许锬介绍了朝鲜社会主义建设所取得的成就和北南关系问题。
    赵紫阳预祝朝鲜在今后社会主义建设中取得更大成绩。他说：“我们党对朝鲜人民争取祖国自主和平统一的斗争，对朝鲜劳动党和金日成主席为此而提出的各项统一方案和各种合理主张一向给予支持。”
    在谈到中国的改革时，赵紫阳总书记说，总的来讲，过去的十年可以说是一个大发展的十年，经济、文化等各项事业确实有很大发展，改革的步子也迈得很大。在前十年大发展之后，去年以来出现了明显的通货膨胀。现在需要缓冲一下。从去年中共十三届三中全会以来，我们通过实行紧缩金融和财政政策，经济发展速度开始降下来了，物价也趋于稳定，总的情况是好的。可以这样说，十三届三中全会决议贯彻以来，已开始取得成效。但我们经济结构调整和宏观控制的任务还很艰巨。如果我们能真正解决上述两个问题，那么所付出的代价就是值得的。这样就不仅能把十年改革所取得的成绩完全巩固下来，而且也是为了以后进一步的改革和发展做准备。
    中联部部长朱良会见时在座。
    许锬同志是１３日中午到达北京的。
