On January 20th, Washington held a grand parade to celebrate the inauguration of the 41st President of the United States. Among the 211 parade formations, the leading one was composed entirely of teachers. The first activity of Bush's inauguration was to meet with 250 teacher representatives from 50 states. In his first speech to Congress, he also emphasized education, hoping that Congress would become an "education Congress." Bush assured the teachers that he would fulfill his campaign promise to be an "education president" because "education is the key to enhancing our nation's competitiveness and the key to strengthening the spirit of the American people."

Bush's emphasis on education is not accidental. Currently, the rapid development of science and technology poses a serious challenge to American education. In recent years, Japanese products have flooded the American market, and Uncle Sam finds it difficult to cope, exclaiming that this is like the Pearl Harbor incident all over again. However, this time, the Japanese weapon is not airplanes and torpedoes, but intelligence. Japan's success lies in the fact that "its blue-collar workers' ability to analyze advanced mathematics, read complex engineering drawings, and perform complex tasks far surpasses that of American blue-collar workers." In 1988, the proportion of educated workers in Japan exceeded 95%, while in the United States, it dropped to around 80%. On a per capita basis, the number of engineering degrees awarded in the United States is only half that of Japan. Someone joked that while the Japanese are mass-producing scientists and engineers, the United States is cultivating experts in riddles and horror movies.

Intense competition and the rise and fall of national power have made Washington realize that to solve the problem of declining international competitiveness, it is not enough to invest billions of dollars in equipment. The key lies in the quality of human resources. However, teachers, who are responsible for developing human resources, are in poor spirits. They have low pay and lack respect. The United States needs to replace 1 million teachers by the end of the century, which is half of the current number of teachers. However, in 1988, only 8% of the 1.6 million new college students were interested in teaching. Educational funding is insufficient, and the proportion of educational appropriations in the federal budget has almost decreased year by year. Additionally, the curriculum setting in primary and secondary schools is not entirely reasonable, and the quality of teaching is not high. Some schools offer courses such as "beauty and makeup" and "widower's cooking," while many students do not know who Columbus and Washington are. It is no wonder that the "National Commission on Excellence in Education" has long warned that "the educational foundation of American society is being eroded by a new generation of mediocrity. This mediocrity threatens the future of the entire nation and the people."

Dissatisfaction with the current state of education stems from concerns about the future of the country. The United States recently had a heated debate about the rise and fall of great powers. Many people noted that the reason the United States' economic power once surpassed Britain was due to the development of education. Between 1948 and 1982, the average annual growth rate of the United States' gross national product was 3.2%, of which 1/3 was achieved through improving the education level of the labor force, and about 1/2 was achieved through technological innovation and skill improvement.

In the future, the foundation that determines a country's development prospects will still be education. Therefore, during his election campaign, Bush said: "When I look to the future, I think that only education is the answer," "Improving education levels is a wise policy. In the coming years, education may be the most powerful economic plan, the most important foreign trade plan, the most effective urban plan; it may provide the most job opportunities and help people escape poverty. Investing in children is the most worthwhile investment. Providing a good education is an investment in America's future."

President Bush has stated that during his term, he will increase educational funding; he plans to convene a national governors' conference to discuss the urgent problems facing schools, including curriculum setting and achievement levels; he will urge state and local education commissions to focus on science and mathematics education from elementary school to graduate school; he will allocate special funds and establish a "Presidential Special Award" to reward outstanding schools and teachers.

"Respect for education and encouragement of learning are the fundamental principles of nation-building; cultivating talents is the primary task of governance." This principle has more urgent and profound significance in today's world. Bush's determination to be an "education president" is a testament to this.

    “教育总统”与美国教育
    温宪
    1月20日，华盛顿举行庆祝美国第41任总统就职的盛大游行，在211个游行方阵中打头的方阵全由教师组成；布什总统就职活动中的第一项也是会见来自50个州的250名教师代表；他在国会发表的首次演说同样突出了教育，期望国会成为“教育国会”。布什向教师们保证，他要兑现在竞选时所作的许诺：当一名“教育总统”，因为“教育是提高我们民族竞争力的关键，是增强我国人民精神的关键”。
    布什如此强调教育绝非偶然。当前，科技发展日新月异，向美国的教育提出严重挑战。近年来，日本货横扫美国市场，山姆大叔难以招架，惊呼这犹如珍珠港事件重演。不过这次日本人的武器不是飞机和鱼雷，而是智力。日本的成功在于“它的蓝领工人解析高等数学、阅读复杂工程设计图纸和从事复杂工作的能力远比美国蓝领工人强”。1988年，日本受过教育的职工比例超过95％，而美国却下降到80％左右。按人口平均计算，美国授予的工程学位数只及日本的一半。有人揶揄道，正当日本人大量造就科学家、工程师之际，美国却在培养猜谜语和欣赏凶杀打斗片的专家。
    激烈的竞争，国力的消长，使华盛顿意识到：要解决国际竞争力下降的问题，光向设备方面投入亿万美元是不够的，关键是人力资源的优劣。但负有开发人力资源重任的教师们的精神状态却欠佳。他们工资低，又乏尊重。美国到本世纪末需替换100万名教师，占目前教师的一半，但在1988年的160万大学新生中，只有8％的学生对教学工作感兴趣。教育经费不足，教育拨款在联邦预算中的比重几乎逐年下降。此外，中小学课程设置不尽合理，教学质量不高。有的学校开设了诸如“美容化妆课”、“鳏夫生活料理课”等，与此同时，不少学生却不知哥伦布、华盛顿何许人。难怪美国“促进良好教育委员会”早就警告说，美国社会的“教育基础正被一批新生的平庸之辈所腐蚀。这批平庸之辈威胁着整个国家和民族的未来”。
    对教育现状的不满源于对国家前途的忧虑。美国不久前曾热热闹闹地争论过大国兴衰之变。不少人注意到美国经济实力当年之所以能超过英国正是得力于教育的发展。在1948年到1982年这一期间，美国的国民生产总值年均增长率为3.2％，其中1／3是通过提高劳工队伍的教育水平取得的，大约1／2是通过技术革新和提高技能取得的。
    今后，决定一国发展前途的基石仍是教育。因此，布什总统竞选期间曾说：“当我展望未来时，我认为只有教育才是答案”，“提高教育水平是一项英明的政策。在今后若干年里，教育可能是最强大的经济计划，最重要的外贸计划，最有效益的城市计划；最能提供就业机会、使人民摆脱贫困的计划。为儿童投资，是最值得的投资。提供良好的教育就是向美国的未来投资。”
    布什总统表示在任期间将增加教育经费；打算召开一次全国州长会议，专门讨论学校面临的紧迫问题，包括课程设置和成绩水平；将敦促各州和地方教育委员会重视从小学到研究生院科学和数学教育；将拨专款并设立“总统特别奖”，以奖励优秀学校和教师等。
    “敬教劝学，建国之大本；兴贤育才，为政之先务”，这个道理在今日世界有着更为紧迫和深远的意义。布什决心要当一位“教育总统”就是明证。
