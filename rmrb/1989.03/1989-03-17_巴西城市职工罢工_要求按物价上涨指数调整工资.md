Brazilian Urban Workers Strike to Demand Wage Adjustments Based on Inflation Index

Xinhua News Agency, Brasília, March 14th. Reporter Lán Cái Jī reports: Urban workers across Brazil began a 48-hour general strike today to protest the government's economic reform plan (the "Summer Plan") aimed at curbing inflation, which has reduced workers' wages and lowered their living standards.

After the strike began, many factories, enterprises, and public service sectors in various parts of Brazil were paralyzed or semi-paralyzed. Public transportation in cities was disrupted, banks, stores, and supermarkets ceased operations, hospitals closed, and many administrative offices and school teachers also joined the strike. According to the national strike command center, the number of participants in the strike is estimated to be about 70% of the total workforce in the country.

This strike movement was initiated by Brazil's two major labor unions—the Unified Labor Center and the General Labor Center. These labor unions demand that the government adjust workers' wages according to the monthly inflation index in implementing the reform plan. However, the government proposes to use the average annual wage increase for workers last year as the basis for wage adjustments. Due to the differences in opinions, negotiations broke down, leading to this large-scale strike. Nevertheless, the Brazilian government still hopes to determine the new wage policy for the next period through further consultations with the labor, management, and government representatives.

### 巴西城市职工罢工  要求按物价上涨指数调整工资

　　巴西城市职工罢工
    要求按物价上涨指数调整工资
    本报巴西利亚３月１４日电  记者兰才基报道：巴西全国各大、中城市职工从今天开始举行４８小时总罢工，以抗议政府推行抑制通货膨胀的经济改革计划（即“夏令计划”）而使职工工资收入减少，生活水平下降。
    罢工开始以后，巴西各地许多工厂企业和公共服务行业处于瘫痪或半瘫痪状态，市内公共交通中断，银行、商店和超级市场停止营业，医院关门，不少行政机构的工作人员和学校教师也加入了罢工的行列。据全国罢工总指挥部估计，参加罢工的人数约占全国职工总数的７０％。
    这次罢工运动是由巴西两大工会组织——劳工统一中心和劳工总中心发动的。这些工会组织要求政府在执行改革计划中，按照每月的物价上涨指数调整职工的工资，而政府方面则提出以去年全年职工工资增长额的平均值为基准进行工资调整。由于各方意见分歧，谈判破裂，导致这场大规模的罢工运动。虽然如此，巴西政府仍然希望通过与劳、资三方再度举行协商的办法来确定今后一个时期的新的工资政策。
