A former Nazi who had killed countless people was so frightened by a movie that he became restless, hid in various places, and eventually died of a heart attack. This is not a fairy tale. It is a true story.

The French weekly *Position* reported that the publisher Lafon this month translated and published a book: *Justice Is Not Revenge*, written by the Austrian Simon Wiesenthal. The book recounts his 30-year pursuit of the Nazi criminal Eduard Roschmann. During the Nazi reign of terror, Roschmann committed countless crimes and was directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of 35,000 innocent people. It was rumored that he was executed at the end of the war. However, two years later, he reappeared and was arrested. Sensing his fate, he escaped by jumping off the transport vehicle, fled by sea to Argentina, and hid there under an assumed name. In the late 1950s, West Germany issued two arrest warrants for him, but both failed. Soon, Wiesenthal also lost track of him, until the early 1970s.

Starting in 1972, writer Friedrich Torberg collaborated with Wiesenthal, using Roschmann's experiences as the basis for writing the book *The Odessa File*, and also produced a film of the same name. The main character and plot in the film were made as realistic as possible, with only one fictional element: Roschmann was captured and executed, to give the audience a "happy ending."

The book was translated into 17 languages, and the film was shown in various countries around the world, truly achieving the effect the author hoped for: some viewers wrote to Wiesenthal, saying that the Nazi had not died and that they had seen him. An American couple recognized the Nazi in a restaurant in Bolivia. They toasted him with a glass of champagne. Afterwards, they carefully packaged the glass and sent it to Wiesenthal in Austria. After verifying the fingerprints, it was confirmed that he was Roschmann. Additionally, a West German actor, inspired by the film, introduced to Wiesenthal the atmosphere among German immigrants in South America: many people did not believe that a civilized nation could persecute Jews so severely, and some families still hung portraits of Hitler and other war criminals. This was one of the bases for the fugitive Nazis to hide in South America.

The film *The Odessa File* was able to move the audience and prompt them to think more deeply, which shows that it has some universal significance. The war has been over for nearly half a century. Isn't everything clear and settled by now? Yes, this is the logic of history. However, there are still strange theories: the crimes of the defeated are imposed by the victors, and if the war had ended differently, everything would be reversed. The implication is that the only mistake of fascism was not winning the war. Based on this logic, some people openly rehabilitate fascism, while others dodge and stammer about this period of history.

From the situation in Western Europe in recent years, it can be seen that the historical dregs of fascism occasionally resurface. A few years ago, during the trial of the French war criminal Barbie, there was a clamor of defense for fascism; the so-called "revisionist historians" are still "revising" the history of World War II, even finding "precedents" for extermination camps like Auschwitz; in the ongoing "Waldheim affair," similar currents have also emerged; in the past year, the votes for far-right or neo-Nazi forces in some important elections have increased.

Of course, this is a countercurrent, and exaggerating it is not in line with reality. Moreover, people believe that evil cannot overcome justice. The fearful appearance of the Nazi Roschmann seeing the movie posters on the street is a reflection of this countercurrent. However, it cannot be ignored. Forgiving past wrongs is a virtue, but it also depends on whether the other party has the intention to reform. As Wiesenthal's book title says, "Justice Is Not Revenge," and only by correctly dealing with history can we better create the future.

At this point, I recall the words of French President Mitterrand, an anti-fascist veteran, when more than seventy Nobel Prize winners gathered in Paris last year: "This century is a century of scientific and technological leaps, but it is also a century that has seen concentration camps and bestial behavior, a century of Auschwitz and penicillin." To prevent the recurrence of "bestial behavior" in the future, we should be like that American couple, that West German actor, those viewers who wrote to Wiesenthal, and especially like the many people who, like Wiesenthal, have dedicated decades to tracking down fugitive Nazis: although the war tragedy ended many years ago, we still maintain vigilant eyes. Only in this way can we uphold justice, suppress evil, and ensure that humanity has a beautiful future, and also make those who attempt to "revise" history feel a bit of pressure.

### 警惕的眼睛——有感于一部电影的威力

　　警惕的眼睛        
    ——有感于一部电影的威力
    一个当年杀人如麻的纳粹分子，被一部电影吓得心神不安，东躲西藏，最后毙命于心脏病发作。这不是“天方夜谭”。这是一个真实的故事。
    法国《方位》周刊报道，拉丰出版社本月翻译出版一本书：《执法不是复仇》，作者是奥地利人西蒙·维兹特尔。书中记述了他追踪纳粹分子爱德华·罗什曼三十多年的经过。罗什曼在纳粹肆虐的年代，罪行累累，对三万五千人的无辜被害负有直接或间接的责任。战争结束之初，传说他被正法了。可两年后他再次露面，遂被捕。他预感到自己的下场，在被解送途中跳车逃脱，经海路到达阿根廷，从此匿名藏形。五十年代末，西德两次下令拘捕他而未果。不久，维兹特尔也失去了他的踪迹，直至七十年代初。
    一九七二年起，作家福尔希求得维兹特尔的合作，以这个纳粹的经历为内容，撰写《敖德萨》一书，并摄制了同名电影。电影中的主角形象和情节都力求真实，只有一处虚构：罗什曼被捕处决了，为的是给观众留个“愉快的结尾”。
    书被译成十七种文字，电影在世界各国放映，并且真的收到了作者盼望的效果：一些观众写信给维兹特尔，说这个纳粹没有死，他们见过他。一对美国夫妇在玻利维亚一家餐馆中认出了这个纳粹。他们向他敬了一杯香槟。事后，他们把这个酒杯精心包装好，寄给了在奥地利的维兹特尔。经验证指纹确认，他就是罗什曼。另外，一位西德演员受到电影的启发，向维兹特尔介绍了南美德国移民当中的气氛：许多人不相信一个文明民族会那样迫害犹太人，有的家至今还挂着希特勒等战犯的肖像。这正是在逃纳粹得以在南美藏身的基础之一。
    电影《敖德萨》能够打动观众，并促使他们去作更深层次的思考，这说明它具有某种普遍的现实意义。战争结束快半个世纪了，不是一切都清楚、都定案了吗？是的，这是历史的逻辑。不过，也还有奇谈怪论：战败者的罪行是战胜者加给的，如果战争是另一种结局，一切就要翻个儿。引伸之义是，法西斯的唯一过错是没有打赢战争。出于这种逻辑，有的公然为法西斯翻案，有的则对这段历史躲躲闪闪，支支吾吾。
    从西欧近几年的情况看，法西斯主义的历史沉渣时有泛起的迹象。前两年，围绕法国审判战犯巴比，出现过为法西斯辩护的喧闹；所谓的“修正史学派”仍在“修正”二次大战的历史，甚至给奥斯威辛集中营这类没有先例的杀人机器找到了什么“先例”；在至今未了的“瓦尔德海姆事件”中也冒出了类似的思潮；近一年来，极右翼或新纳粹势力在一些重要选举中的得票上升。
    当然，这是逆流，夸大它是不符合实际的。况且人们相信，邪不压正。纳粹分子罗什曼看到街头的那些电影招贴而心惊的怯相，就是这股逆流的写照。但是，又不能无视它。不念旧恶是一种美德，可也要看对方有无改恶从善的意思。正如维兹特尔的书名所说，“执法不是复仇”，而只有正确地对待历史，才能更好地开创未来。
    写到这里，想起了去年七十余名诺贝尔奖金获得者聚会巴黎时，法国总统密特朗这位反法西斯的老兵说的几句话：我们这个世纪是“一个科学和技术跃进的世纪，也是一个出现过集中营和兽性行为的世纪，是奥斯威辛和青霉素的世纪”。为了防范将来再出现“兽性行为”，就应当像那对美国夫妇、那位西德演员、那些写信给维兹特尔的观众、尤其是跟维兹特尔一样致力于追查在逃纳粹几十年的许多人那样：尽管战争悲剧结束已经多年了，依然保持着警惕的眼睛。这样，才能弘扬正义，压迫邪恶，使人类得以有一个美好的未来，也使那些妄图“修正”历史的人时时感受到一点点压抑。
