Today, various newspapers in Yugoslavia published a statement from the Federal Ministry of Interior, which stated that the recent bloody demonstrations and marches by Albanian nationalist and separatist elements in Kosovo have the nature of an armed rebellion. The statement also announced the dispatch of additional police forces to decisively crush the violent actions of Albanian separatists in Kosovo.

The statement believes that these demonstrations and marches are a continuation of the events in Kosovo in November last year and February this year. They are a blatant and frenzied opposition to Yugoslavia's suppression of the counter-revolution in Kosovo, the implementation of the policies of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and the amendment of the Serbian constitution. The aim is to create instability in Yugoslavia, threaten its territorial integrity. The demonstrators destroyed and burned cars and train carriages, smashed shops and other public buildings, damaged public and private property, threatened the safety of residents, and attacked security forces with weapons and other objects, causing casualties. Police were forced to defend themselves according to relevant laws and orders from superiors. In the conflict, 2 police officers were killed and 25 injured, while 19 demonstrators were killed and 49 injured. The Ministry of Interior has arrested 146 of the most violent demonstrators, who will be subject to legal punishment.

Given that the security situation in Kosovo may further deteriorate, Yugoslavia has dispatched additional police forces from Serbia and Vojvodina to the region.

　　南斯拉夫内务部发表公报强调        
    科索沃流血事件属武装叛乱性质        
    宣布增派部队粉碎阿族分裂主义者暴力行为
    本报贝尔格莱德３月２９日电  记者严正报道：今天南斯拉夫各报公布的联邦内务部公报指出，最近几天科索沃阿尔巴尼亚民族主义和分裂主义分子发动的流血示威游行具有武装叛乱的性质，并宣布再次增派警察部队，坚决粉碎科索沃的反革命暴力行为。
    公报认为这次示威游行是去年科索沃１１月事件和今年２月事件的继续，是对南斯拉夫粉碎科索沃的反革命、对执行南共联盟政策以及对塞尔维亚修改宪法进行公开的疯狂的对抗，旨在造成南斯拉夫局势动荡不稳，威胁其领土完整。示威者捣毁和焚烧汽车、火车车厢，砸商店和其它公共建筑，破坏社会财富和私人财产，威胁居民安全，并用武器和其它器物攻击安全部队，造成伤亡，迫使警察根据有关法令和上级命令进行自卫。在冲突中，警察已死亡２名，伤２５名，示威者死１９名，伤４９名。内务部机构已逮捕１４６名最疯狂的示威者，将给予法律制裁。
    鉴于科索沃目前的安全局势还有可能恶化，南又从塞尔维亚和伏伊伏丁那向那里增派了警察部队。
