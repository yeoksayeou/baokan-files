    Theater enthusiasts in Wuhan have been eagerly anticipating the "Elite Peking Opera Exhibition Performance" featuring renowned artists and aficionados from both Beijing and Wuhan. The eight scheduled performances have sold out, with some shows setting a new record for ticket sales at 8 yuan per performance in Wuhan.

    Notably, this highly anticipated performance was not organized by government cultural departments nor sponsored by large enterprises. Instead, it was entirely funded and organized by a group of Peking Opera enthusiasts and amateur performers in Wuhan. They took the opportunity of the establishment of the Wuhan Amateur Peking Opera Research Society to invite famous performers such as Guan Zhengming, Li Weikang, Zhang Xuezin, Geng Qichang, Zhao Baoxiu, Zhu Shuihui, Ye Jin, Deng Min, and Li Chunfang from Beijing and Wuhan. Together with local aficionados, they have added a vibrant dimension to the cultural life of Wuhan's residents.

    Wuhan, known as the "Throat of Nine Provinces," has a long-standing reputation as a hub for Peking Opera. Amateur Peking Opera singing activities have a rich tradition here. Currently, there are over 20 ticket offices scattered throughout Wuhan, acting as a bridge connecting millions of theater enthusiasts with professional troupes. Self-funded performances by enthusiasts, which align supply and demand, offer a viable solution to the current sharp contradiction between theatrical performances and audience needs. Although this path is fraught with challenges, it is filled with hope and potential as long as experiences are continually summarized and support is garnered from various sectors of society.

    The Elite Peking Opera Exhibition Performance began on March 6th and will conclude on March 13th.

　　戏迷自筹资金京剧精英在武汉展演
    本报讯  记者易凯报道：连日来，武汉三镇的京剧戏迷们，以空前喜悦的心情争睹由京、汉两地京剧名家和名票参加的“京剧精英展览演出”，预定八场戏票已全部售空，有的场次创下了武汉市京剧售票８元一场的最高纪录。
    耐人寻味的是这场颇受观众欢迎的演出不是由政府有关文化部门出资组织的，也不是依赖社会大型企事业单位赞助的，而完全是由武汉市一群酷爱京剧艺术的戏迷、票友自筹资金、自主操办的。他们借武汉市业余京剧研究社成立之际，从京汉两地请来关正明、李维康、张学津、耿其昌、赵葆秀、朱世慧、叶金援、邓敏、李春芳等著名演员，联合两地名票，为武汉市群众的文化生活增添了这一项极富色彩的内容。
    武汉号称“九省通衢”，素有京剧大码头之誉，群众性业余京剧演唱活动传统悠久。目前，武汉散落的票房有２０余家。他们像纽带一样，一头连着千千万万的戏迷，一头连着专业剧团。由戏迷自筹资金自办演出，产销对路，供求平衡，不失为解决当前普遍存在的戏剧演出与观众之间尖锐矛盾的好办法之一。有关人士认为，这条路尽管困难重重，只要不断总结经验，取得社会各界的谅解和支持，是充满着光明和希望的。
    京剧精英展演是３月６日拉开帷幕的，３月１３日全部结束。
