Title: Difficulty in Selling Pigs Resurfaces in Fufeng County

Fufeng County, one of the major pig production bases in our province, has recently encountered difficulties in selling pigs again. The county's food company and its 15 affiliated food stations have closed their doors and stopped accepting pigs. Farmers have nearly 10,000 fat pigs that they cannot sell, and pig farmers are extremely anxious! The main reasons are as follows:

First, provincial and municipal departments have restricted or even stopped the upward adjustment of pig quotas. Fufeng County formulated preferential policies last year to encourage farmers to raise pigs. By November 1988, the county's pig inventory increased from 80,000 heads in the first half of the year to 103,000 heads, with 10,000 heads marketed before the Spring Festival. With the recovery of pig production, the problem of poor pig sales has also emerged. This year, the province and Fufeng County signed a contract to market 71,000 heads annually, averaging over 5,900 heads per month. However, in reality, the provincial food company only accepted 1,300 heads in January, and the Baoji City Food Company stopped accepting pigs due to full storage.

Second, the current procurement system hinders the export of pigs. The province stipulates that pigs from pig production base counties are not allowed to be sold out of the province, which forces the county food company to terminate its supply and marketing relationship with external units such as the Wuhan Meat Processing Plant. When the upper-level business departments cannot package all the pigs, the county food department finds it difficult to expand the sales channels in a short time, resulting in pig stagnation.

Third, the profitability of pig farming has decreased, and farmers' sentiments are fluctuating. In recent months, the pig procurement price has fallen repeatedly, from 3.8 yuan per kilogram to 3.08 yuan, while the market price of corn has risen to 0.6 yuan per kilogram. Due to the lack of a government-protected price, farmers are concerned about further price drops and are rushing to sell their pigs, increasing the number of pigs marketed.

Fourth, the issuance of white receipts for the sale of fat pigs has caused farmer dissatisfaction and also affected the enthusiasm of the procurement departments. Since November last year, the provincial food company has accumulated 2.3 million yuan in arrears for pig procurement in Fufeng County, and the municipal food company owes 900,000 yuan, totaling 3.2 million yuan. The Fufeng County Food Company had to borrow money to pay farmers, with monthly interest payments reaching 400,000 yuan. The company, which has an annual profit of only 500,000 yuan, had to issue white receipts to farmers when purchasing pigs, causing strong dissatisfaction among farmers.

Currently, the provincial and municipal pork storage is full, and the restriction on upward adjustment will continue for some time. However, Fufeng County will have 24,000 fat pigs marketed before the summer harvest. If the pig sales channels are not cleared and the procurement prices are not stabilized, the difficulty in selling pigs will worsen month by month, and farmers' enthusiasm for pig farming will be seriously affected. In this case, the phenomenon of a significant decline in pig production may reoccur.

### 扶风县再次出现卖猪难

　　扶风县再次出现卖猪难
    我省生猪生产基地之一扶风县，最近再次出现卖猪难。全县食品公司及所属的１５个食品站关门停收生猪。农民有近万头肥猪卖不出去，养猪户焦急万分！主要原因如下：
    一是省、市有关部门限量甚至停止上调。扶风县去年制定优惠政策，鼓励农民养猪，到１９８８年１１月，扶风县生猪存栏数由上半年的８万头上升到１０．３万头，春节前出栏１万头。随着生猪生产的回升，同时也出现了生猪销路不畅的问题。今年，省里和扶风县签订了全年上调７．１万头的合同，每月平均５９００多头。但实际上今年１月，省食品公司只要１３００头，宝鸡市食品公司因库满停止上调。
    二是现行收购体制阻碍着生猪外销。省里规定，生猪基地县的生猪不准出省，这个规定迫使县食品公司中断了同武汉肉联厂等外省单位的供销关系。而上级业务部门在猪多时包销不了，县食品部门一时又难以扩大销路，就造成了生猪滞销的状况。
    三是养猪效益下降，农民情绪波动。近几月来，生猪收购价格一跌再跌，由每公斤３．８元降到３．０８元，而市场玉米售价已涨至每公斤０．６元，由于政府未制订保护价，农民担心生猪收购价格再跌，纷纷交售，使出栏量增加。
    四是交售肥猪打白条，农民意见大，也影响收购部门的积极性。去年１１月以来，省食品公司累计拖欠扶风县生猪收购款２３０万元，市食品公司欠９０万元，共计３２０万元。扶风县食品公司只好贷款付给农民，月付利息达４万元。这个公司常年盈利只有５万元，只得改为收猪时给农民打白条，引起农民强烈不满。
    目前，省、市猪肉库存已满，限量上调还将持续一段时间，而扶风县在夏收前将有２．４万头肥猪出栏，如不疏通生猪销路，稳定收购价格，卖猪难的矛盾将会逐月加剧，农民养猪的积极性会受到严重挫伤。这样，生猪生产大滑坡的现象将会再度出现。陕西宝鸡市委办公室　张浩印
