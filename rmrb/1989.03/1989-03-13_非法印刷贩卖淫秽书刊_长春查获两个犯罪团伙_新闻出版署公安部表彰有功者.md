Recently, the State Press and Publication Administration and the Ministry of Public Security held a meeting in Changchun, Jilin Province, to commend the units and individuals who participated in the investigation and apprehension of a major case involving the illegal printing and selling of pornographic books last year.

In May 1988, the Changchun City Book and Magazine Market Management Office discovered that some book peddlers were selling two kinds of illegally published pornographic books. In October of the same year, the public security organs of Changchun and Baicheng regions, based on information provided by the public, seized 8 kinds and 173 copies of pornographic books from individual book stalls. Based on this lead, the public security organs of the two regions, in close cooperation with the Jilin Provincial Press and Publication Department and relevant departments, conducted a meticulous investigation over several months. They uncovered two major cases involving the printing and selling of pornographic books in the Changchun region, involving over 100 people. They exposed two major criminal gangs led by Sun Yuqing and Wang Honglin, who were involved in the illegal printing and selling of pornographic books. These criminals, from March to November 1988, printed a total of 9 kinds of pornographic books, amounting to 120,000 copies, which were sold to individual book stalls in 12 cities and counties across three provinces: Jilin, Liaoning, and Heilongjiang.
