	Khomeini's Daughter Speaks About Khomeini
	The daughter of Iran's religious leader Khomeini, Mustafaavi, recently spoke to a reporter from the Washington Post in Tehran about her father.

	Mustafaavi is 48 years old and is Khomeini's youngest daughter. In her eyes, Khomeini is a devout Muslim who strongly believes in the fundamentalism of Islam. Anyone who defames the holy prophets of Islam will make him furious. He once said: "If I lose my reputation or charm, let it be damned. I only care about defending Islam, not myself."

	There is one thing on which she disagrees with her father. Early last month, Tehran Radio broadcasted a statement from an Iranian woman saying that the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad is not a model for today's women. Khomeini considered this an insult and threatened to execute the program host. Mustafaavi investigated and found that the host had no malicious intent, so she told her father the truth. Khomeini admitted that he had not listened to the program and reconsidered the matter. The next day, after being sentenced to four to five years in prison and fifty lashes, all four program hosts were pardoned.

	In her conversation, Mustafaavi refers to her father by his religious title, "Imam." In her mind, her father is a strict, clean, very detail-oriented, and taciturn patriarch who often suppresses his emotions towards his children. She said, "To everyone else, including the gatekeeper and high-ranking government officials, he is very serious."

	Mustafaavi said that Khomeini often listens to news broadcasts for hours at a time. He has a pocket radio and listens to it even while fasting or eating, as he does not want to receive indirect information from others. He listens to foreign news and all important speeches by Iranian government officials.

	Khomeini is very punctual. If he finds that his morning walk ends ten seconds early, he will go back to the courtyard before entering the house. She also said that Khomeini sprays French cologne six or seven times a day, "so his room is so fragrant that I always associate it with heaven in my memory."

	Mustafaavi said, "Many reports in the outside world have distorted and defamed us." She denied Western intelligence reports that 87-year-old Khomeini has cancer. But she admitted that Khomeini has had heart problems for eight or nine years and is currently undergoing medication treatment. To maintain his health, he walks three times a day, each time for half an hour, and does leg lifts and torso exercises in bed at night.

    霍梅尼女儿谈霍梅尼
    伊朗宗教领袖霍梅尼的女儿穆斯塔法维最近在德黑兰接受美国《华盛顿邮报》记者采访时，谈到她父亲的一些情况。
    穆斯塔法维现年四十八岁，是霍梅尼的小女儿。在她眼中，霍梅尼是位强烈信仰穆斯林原教旨主义的虔诚教徒，任何亵渎伊斯兰先圣的人都会使他感到愤慨。他曾说：“如果失去我的名誉或魅力，就让它见鬼去吧。我只为保卫伊斯兰而操心，而不是我自己。”
    有一件事，她与父亲有分歧。上月初，德黑兰电台播出一位伊朗妇女的话，说一先知穆罕默德之女不是当今妇女的楷模。霍梅尼认定这是侮辱，威胁要处死节目主持人。穆斯塔法维调查后认为主持人并无恶意，遂向父亲据实相告。霍梅尼承认自己未收听这个节目，重新考虑此事。其后，在被判入狱四至五年并鞭笞五十下的次日，四位节目主持人全部获得赦免。
    穆斯塔法维在言谈中按宗教头衔称父亲为“伊玛姆”。在她心目中，父亲是一位严厉、清洁、十分注意细节、寡言少欢的家长，常常克制对孩子们的感情。她说，“对所有其他人来说，包括守门人和政府高级官员，他都非常严肃。”
    穆斯塔法维说，霍梅尼常常一连数小时收听新闻广播。他有一架袖珍收音机，守斋甚至用饭时都听，他从不愿从别人那里得到间接消息。他听国外新闻，还收听所有伊朗政府官员的重要讲话。
    霍梅尼非常守时。如果发现早晨散步结束时提前了十秒钟，他会在进屋前重新回到庭院去。她还说，霍梅尼每天要喷撒六七次法国科隆香水，“所以他的房间是那么香，我记忆中总把它与天堂联想在一起。”
    穆斯塔法维说，“外界出现的许多报道都对我们进行了歪曲和抹黑。”她否认西方情报机构关于八十七岁的霍梅尼身染癌症的说法。但她承认，霍梅尼心脏欠佳已有八九年，现接受药物治疗。为保持健康，他每天散步三次，每次半小时，晚间在床上做抬腿和躯干活动。
