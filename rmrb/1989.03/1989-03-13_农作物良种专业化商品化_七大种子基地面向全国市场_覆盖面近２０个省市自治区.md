The specialized and commercialized production of high-quality agricultural seeds in China has developed rapidly. Currently, seven large-scale seed production bases have been established in provinces such as Hebei, Jiangsu, and Anhui, facing the national market. This has improved the backward situation where farmers used to plant whatever seeds they had.

The seven major agricultural seed production bases are: the Chengdu Hybrid Rice Seed Production Base in Sichuan, the Jiangsu Yancity Hybrid Rice Seed Company, the Jiangsu Danyang Yangtze River Cotton Seed Company, the Liaoning Chaoyang Region Hybrid Corn Development Joint Venture, the Hebei Chengde Great Wall Hybrid Corn Company, the Anhui Hefei Watermelon Seed Company, and the Liaoning Benxi Vegetable Seed Company. According to the National Seed Administration of the Ministry of Agriculture, these seven major seed bases have a planting area of over 1.3 million mu (approximately 867,000 acres), all equipped with advanced seed production equipment and technology. The high-quality seeds produced by these bases, in addition to meeting local needs, are mostly sold nationwide, covering nearly 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. The Liaoning Chaoyang Region Hybrid Corn Base has a planting area of 600,000 mu (approximately 399,000 acres) and produces 1.5 billion kilograms of seeds annually.

    这七大农作物种子生产基地是：四川成都杂交稻种生产基地、江苏盐城杂交稻种子公司、江苏丹阳长江棉种公司、辽宁朝阳地区杂交玉米开发联合体、河北承德长城杂交玉米公司、安徽合肥西瓜种子公司、辽宁本溪蔬菜种子公司。据农业部全国种子总站介绍，这七大种子基地植种面积达一百三十多万亩，均拥有先进的制种设备和技术，所产作物良种，除满足自用外，大部分销往全国各地，覆盖面近二十个省、市、自治区。辽宁朝阳地区杂交玉米基地植种面积六十万亩，年产种子一点五亿公斤。
