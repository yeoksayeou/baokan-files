People's Daily, Bonn, March 15th. Reporter Jiang Jian Guo reports: The last empress of the Austro-Hungarian Empire's Habsburg dynasty, Zita von Habsburg, passed away yesterday at the age of 96 in Switzerland without illness.

Zita was the daughter of an Italian noble, the Duke of Parma. In October 1911, she married Archduke Karl, the nephew of Emperor Franz Joseph I of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1916, Archduke Karl ascended the throne as Karl I, and Zita became the Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary. After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in November 1918, Karl I and Zita went into exile. Zita always referred to herself as the Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, which is why the Austrian government long refused to allow her to return to Austria. It was not until 1982, with the intervention of her relative, King Juan Carlos of Spain, that she was able to visit her homeland for the first time.

Austrian Foreign Minister Mock described Zita as a "great figure" in Austrian history. The Austrian government will hold a grand funeral for her on April 1, burying her remains in the Imperial Crypt at the Franciscan Church in Vienna.

Zita's husband, Karl, died earlier in 1922.

　　流亡瑞士七十载　无冠娘娘仍称后
    奥匈帝国末代皇后辞世
    本报波恩３月１５日电  记者江建国报道：原奥匈帝国哈布斯堡王朝的末代皇后齐塔·冯·哈布斯堡，昨天以９６岁高龄在瑞士无疾而终。
    齐塔是意大利贵族波旁—帕尔马公爵之女，１９１１年１０月与奥匈帝国皇帝弗朗茨·约瑟夫一世的侄子卡尔大公结婚。１９１６年卡尔大公继任皇位，称卡尔一世，齐塔同时成为奥地利皇后兼匈牙利王后。１９１８年１１月奥匈帝国崩溃后，卡尔一世和齐塔流亡国外，齐塔始终自称为奥地利皇后兼匈牙利王后，因而奥地利政府曾长期拒绝她重返奥地利。１９８２年，由她的亲戚、西班牙国王胡安·卡洛斯干预，她才首次重返故里访问。
    奥地利外长莫克称齐塔是奥地利历史上的一位“伟大人物”。奥地利政府将在４月１日为她举行隆重葬礼，将她的遗体安葬在维也纳方济各天主教堂的皇帝陵墓。
    齐塔的丈夫卡尔早于１９２２年去世。
