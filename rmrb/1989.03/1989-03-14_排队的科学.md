    The Science of Queuing
    By Cang Lide, People's Daily Reporter

    In daily life, queuing is probably one of the most frustrating and unavoidable things. In the United States, it is estimated that each person spends an average of more than 2,000 hours in their lifetime queuing. Generally, people's attitudes are that when dealing with government offices, no matter how long the queue, one has to endure it, as there is "only one place to go, no alternatives"; when waiting in line at private shops or restaurants, sorry, we won't go to another place?

    Can we keep the customers who come to the store and make the queuing time more bearable?

    Professor Larsen of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a thoughtful person. He often stands by the window for hours, observing and recording the queuing situation, or talks with people in the queue to understand their psychological reactions. Using psychological and mathematical knowledge for analysis, Larsen found that people are not so much bothered by the long queuing time as they are by the "unequal opportunities." For example, in a fast-food restaurant, when there are 6 queues of customers, everyone hopes to be in the shortest, fastest-moving queue, but there is only one chance to choose. As a result, often the latercomers in another queue get served first, which truly makes one feel resentful. Larsen suggests that behavior and psychology are influenced by the environment, and appropriately changing the environment can reduce the discomfort of waiting.

    Based on Larsen's suggestions, many public places have taken corresponding measures. In banks, fast-food restaurants, post offices, and other crowded places, "S"-shaped barriers are installed in the hall, from one end to the other, ensuring that those who arrive first are served first, and avoiding crowding at each service counter.

    As for changing the environment, each place has its own tricks. Some large hotels have installed floor-to-ceiling mirrors in the elevator area. People waiting for the elevator will instinctively check their appearance and clothing, and women will not miss this opportunity. Unknowingly, the elevator door opens to welcome passengers, and a soft, rhythmic background music wafts out. In airport waiting halls, some chairs are equipped with pay-per-view televisions to help passengers pass the time. Some supermarkets have special children's playrooms, so children can avoid the troubles of shopping and paying.

    In a store in Portland, Oregon, the reporter saw a pianist in a tailcoat playing classical music in the hall, apparently to enhance the shopping experience and reduce customers' psychological burden while waiting to pay at the cash register. In the crowded Disney World in Florida, each amusement project entrance has an antique-style sign telling visitors how long they will have to wait, so that people do not become anxious and lose their enthusiasm for the game.

　　排队的科学
    本报记者  仓立德
    日常生活中，排队大概要算一件令人头痛而又无可奈何的事。在美国，据估计，每人一生用于排队的时间平均要２０００多小时。一般人们的态度是，在政府“衙门”办事，队再长也得忍，“只此一家，别无分店”，没办法；在私人商店或饭馆挨人头，对不起，咱不会另找一家？
    能不能把店铺到手的顾客留住，让排队的时间好过点呢？
    麻省理工学院教授拉尔森是个有心人。他常常一连几个钟头站在玻璃窗外，观察、记录排队情形；或者与队里的人交谈，体会他们的心态反应。依靠心理学和数学知识分析，拉尔森发现，与其说人们嫌站队时间长，不如说难以容忍“机会不均等”。譬如在快餐店，当有６队顾客时，每个人都希望自己排在最短、移动最快的队后，但只有一次选择。结果往往是，后来者排在另一队却先得到服务，这真叫人打心眼里窝火。拉尔森建议，行为、心理受环境影响，适当改变环境，会减轻等候的不快感。
    根据拉尔森的建议，许多公共场所都采取了相应措施。在银行、快餐店、邮局等人多的地方，大厅里安上“Ｓ”型栏杆，一头一尾，顾客依次排列，既可保证先到者在前，又可避免各服务台前的拥挤。
    至于改变环境，各处都有高招。一些大饭店的电梯间前装上落地镜，等候电梯的人都会情不自禁看看自己的容貌、衣着，女士们更不愿错过这个机会。不知不觉中，电梯间开门纳客，里面飘来一阵节奏舒缓、似有还无的背景音乐。在机场候机厅里，一些椅子旁安上收费电视机，可以帮候机者挨过令人心焦的时光。一些超级市场专设儿童游乐室，孩子们可以免去购物、交款的烦恼。
    在俄勒冈州波特兰市的一家商店里，记者曾看见一位身着燕尾服的钢琴师在大厅里弹奏古典名曲，看来也是为了提高购物情趣，减轻顾客在收银机前等候交款的心理负担。在游人如织的佛罗里达迪斯尼世界，每个游乐项目入口处都挂着古香古色的牌子，告诉游客等候多长时间，免得人们焦躁不安，游兴大减。
    生活中处处有科学。多一些拉尔森那样的有心人，人们会更爱身边这个世界。
