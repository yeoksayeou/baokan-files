Still, buying is not as good as renting

To make people willing to spend money on buying houses, they must feel, through calculations, that buying is indeed more cost-effective than renting. However, based on the recent prices of commercial housing in Shanghai and Beijing, no matter how you calculate, you won't get the conclusion that renting is not as good as buying.

On February 15, Beijing's first batch of publicly sold commercial housing had prices per square meter ranging from 1,600 to 1,900 yuan. Shanghai's recently announced prices are even more shocking, at 2,300 yuan per square meter! A typical two-bedroom apartment with a living room, with a total area (including balconies, public corridors, etc.) of 50 square meters, would cost 80,000 yuan in Beijing at the lowest price, and 115,000 yuan in Shanghai.

If this money is not used to buy a house but is deposited in a bank, the annual interest rate for a one-year fixed deposit is 11.34%. Therefore, 80,000 yuan can earn 9,072 yuan in interest per year, averaging 756 yuan per month; 115,000 yuan can earn 13,041 yuan in interest per year, averaging 1,086.75 yuan per month. The interest for fixed deposits with a term of more than three years would be even higher.

Currently, in cities that have not yet undergone reforms, the monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment with a living room is generally around 10 yuan, which is only about 1 to 2 jiao per square meter. Even in the reform pilot city of Yantai, where reforms have begun, the monthly rent per square meter has only increased to over 1 yuan, and the state provides substantial subsidies, so the monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment with a living room is at most 70 to 80 yuan. Even if the pace of reform accelerates, the monthly rent for this type of housing is unlikely to rise to 756 yuan, let alone over 1,000 yuan.

Where does the money come from?

For a two-bedroom apartment costing 80,000 yuan, where does the money come from? For ordinary families living on wages, they probably wouldn't even dare to think about it. People naturally think of wealthy individual business owners, but surprisingly, the number of individual business owners registered to buy houses is very small, accounting for only a few percent in Beijing's "first batch." This means that the vast majority of buyers are still wage earners.

Do these people have so much money? Yes, but they must have "outside income." If one insists that all of it comes from wage savings, then let's calculate. Generally, those who are still worried about a two-bedroom apartment before the wage reform would not have been high earners. At that time, having tens of thousands of yuan in savings was extremely rare. This means that the money for buying the house is either entirely or mostly saved in the past four or five years. Even if we calculate it over five years, 80,000 yuan means an average of 16,000 yuan per year, or over 1,300 yuan per month. Which profession's family can have so much "leftover money"? If one insists that there really is, then one might as well ask how much personal income adjustment tax their family has paid? Because, based on the calculation of over 1,300 yuan in leftover money, even if their family has three people earning a lot, the average monthly income would still exceed the taxable threshold (individual monthly income of over 400 yuan).

One million vacant housing units mean...

It is reported that Shanghai's 11,000 housing units, which were priced and put up for sale at the beginning of the year, have less than one-tenth of them sold, leaving tens of thousands of square meters of new buildings idle.

What does this mean? If one family delays moving into a new house by one or two days, it's not a big deal; if 11,000 houses are scattered in various places and idle for one or two days, it won't attract much attention. But if you calculate it differently, it might still be shocking. One million idle houses mean that one house is idle for one million days. One million days is 27 years and four months!

Shanghai's 11,000 houses have been idle for far more than one day; some have been idle for ten days, several tens of days, and some are still idle now. How many newly built houses across the country are idle for a long time due to high prices and cannot be sold?

　　三笔“歪账”
    吴酩
    还是买不如租
    想让人乐意掏钱买房，就得让人通过算账，真正感到确实买比租合算。可就最近上海、北京公布的商品房价，任你怎么算，也得不出租不如买的结论。
    北京二月十五日首批公开出售的商品房，每平方米标价分别为一千六百、一千七百、一千九百元。上海前不久推出的房价更吓人，每平方米二千三百！一套普遍人家居住的两室一厅单元房，建筑面积（包括凉台、公用楼道等），如果以五十平方米算，按北京的低限价格，得八万元，上海则需要十一点五万元。
    如果不用这笔钱买房，而是存入银行生利。按一年定期存款的年利率百分之十一点三四计算，八万元一年可得利息九千零七十二元，平均每月七百五十六元；十一点五万元的年息是一万三千零四十一元，平均每月一千零八十六点七五元。三年以上的定期保值存款，得利息就更多。
    而眼下，还没改革的城市，两室一厅楼房的月租，一般在十元左右，每平方米不过一两角钱。就是在已经开始实转的改革试点城市烟台，每平方米的月租也只提到一元多点，国家还给了相当的补贴，两室一厅的月租顶多七八十元。恐怕改革的步子迈得再大，这类住房的月租也不可能涨到七百五十六元，更甭说上千了。
    　　　　钱从哪儿来？
    两居室，八万元，钱从哪儿来？一般靠工资吃饭的人家，恐怕想都不敢想。人们自然而然地想到腰缠万贯的个体户，可偏偏登记买房的个体户极少，北京的“首批”中只占百分之几。也就是说买房的绝大多数还是吃工资的。
    这些人能有这么多钱吗？能，但必须得有“外财”。如果一口咬定全部是工资积蓄，那就得算算了。一般情况下，至今还为两居室犯愁的人，工资改革以前，决不会是拿高薪的。而那时，社会上存款能上万的实属凤毛麟角。也就是说，这些买房钱全部或绝大部分应是近四五年攒出来的。就以五年算，八万元，每年平均一点六万，每月平均一千三百多元。请问，干哪行的人家，一个月能有如此多的“余钱剩米”？如果还咬定真有，那不妨问问，他家交过个人收入调节税没有？交了多少？因为，照一千三百多元的余钱算，他家就是有三个人挣大钱，平均月收入也超过征税的起征点（个人月收入四百元以上）了。
    　　　　一万套住房空闲意味……
    报载，上海年初标价出售的一万一千套住房，成交不到十分之一，几十万平方米新楼房白白空闲着。
    这意味什么？一套新房，住户晚搬进去一两天，不算什么；一万套住房，分散在各处，空闲一两天，也不会引起人们的特别注意。但换个算法，可能就也要吓人一跳。一万套房子闲一天，可以说相当于一套房子闲了一万天。一万天就是二十七年零四个多月！
    上海的一万套，闲了远不止一天，不少闲了十天、几十天，有的直闲到现在。而全国又有多少盖好的新房，因价格过高卖不出去而长期空闲着呢？
