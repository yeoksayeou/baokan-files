Lu Xun's early self-penned poem for his portrait is familiar to everyone. It is a seven-character quatrain: "灵台无计逃神矢，风雨如磐闇故园，寄意寒星荃不察，我以我血荐轩辕." This was written by Lu Xun when he first went to Japan to study. According to Xu Shouchang, this poem was sent by Lu Xun in 1903, but Lu Xun later recalled writing it at the age of 21, which would be in early 1902. Regarding the interpretation of this poem, there is generally no disagreement. It can be said that this is the earliest patriotic oath of young Lu Xun, which laid the foundation for his later life and political direction. The second line, "风雨如磐," comes from the Book of Songs, and the third line, "寒星" and "荃不察," come from the Chu Ci. "轩辕" refers to the Yellow Emperor, a symbol of China's ancestors. These are all straightforward. "风雨如磐" is not about actual wind and rain, but rather that the country was then under the oppression of foreign imperialist powers, which is easy to understand.

Only the first line of the poem has later caused some unnecessary misunderstandings. Later commentators often thought that "灵台" refers to the heart, and "神矢" is the arrow of the Western god of love. I have always believed this to be completely incorrect. Before the Cultural Revolution, I had discussed my views with some friends who study Lu Xun, but because there was already an authoritative interpretation in China, my explanation did not receive enough attention. I still feel the need to clarify this.

"灵台" as the heart is seen in Zhuangzi's "Gengsang Chu," which states, "不可内于灵台." In fact, this is an extended meaning from the Warring States period. The term "灵台" appears early in the Book of Songs, referring to the observatory built by King Wen of Zhou. Whether this observatory actually existed or is just an ancient legend, this can only be resolved by future archaeologists. In any case, since the unification of China by the Zhou dynasty, it has been said that there was such a place, which was the center of the world. In the Great Odes, "灵台" is the name of a poem praising King Wen. Zheng Xuan's commentary states, "King Wen received the mandate and built a city at Feng, establishing the Lingtai." It is also seen in Mencius, "King Wen used the people's strength to build platforms and ponds, and the people rejoiced, calling his platform the Lingtai." By the Warring States period, the myth of the Yellow Emperor began to spread, and the Yellow Emperor became the ancestor of various Chinese ethnic groups. Lingtai then became the platform of the Yellow Emperor. From the Warring States to the Qin and Han dynasties, in ancient astronomy and medicine, Lingtai was both the central astronomical observatory and was extended to mean a star in the sky and the center of the human body. Therefore, Zhuangzi used Lingtai as a metaphor for the heart. In the Three Duplicates Yellow Map of the Han Dynasty, the central observatory was named Lingtai. The Book of Jin's Treatise on Astronomy also states, "The three stars to the west of the Mingtang are called Lingtai, the observatory, which oversees clouds and things." In any case, after the Warring States period, Lingtai was the platform of the Yellow Emperor. Whether it refers to the heart in the human body or a star in the sky, it is a symbol of the center. The legend of King Wen had been replaced by the Yellow Emperor.

Since "灵台" refers to the platform of the Yellow Emperor, the line "灵台无计逃神矢" is easily resolved. Lu Xun enjoyed reading the Classic of Mountains and Seas in his youth. In the Western Wilderness, it says, "There is the platform of Xuanyuan, and the archer does not dare to shoot westward, fearing the platform of Xuanyuan." The Western Wilderness also says, "The Exhausted Mountain is to its north, and one does not dare to shoot westward, fearing the mound of Xuanyuan." Guo Pu's commentary states, "Respect the spirit of the Yellow Emperor," and He Yi's commentary states, "The platform is also a mound." It seems that ancient people believed that there were many demons in the four directions of China, but they all feared the platform of Xuanyuan and did not dare to shoot arrows at it. The Classic of Mountains and Seas also mentions the platform of Gonggong, saying that various demons in different places did not dare to shoot arrows at the platform. For example, in the Northern Wilderness, it says, "There is the platform of Gonggong, and the archer does not dare to shoot northward." The Northern Wilderness also says, "Xiang Liu has nine heads, a human face, and a snake's body, and is green. He does not dare to shoot northward, fearing the platform of Gonggong," which all mean the same thing. Because Gonggong was also a ruler who contested with the emperor in ancient mythology.

Since the last line of Lu Xun's poem says, "我以我血荐轩辕," the allusion used is naturally from the ancient myth of the platform of Xuanyuan. Therefore, the first line should also use the same allusion, meaning that the country was then in a dark age of storm and stress, and the demons of the four directions, meaning the imperialist powers, no longer feared the might of the Yellow Emperor and dared to attack the platform. Lu Xun wrote this poem at a time when imperialist powers were attacking China one after another.

In the past, many people thought that "神矢" referred to the arrow of the god of love in Western mythology, which is completely illogical. Patriotic sentiment and romantic love are two different things, and in Greek and Roman mythology, the two should not be confused. Lu Xun was not ignorant of Western literature and would not have made such a comparison. In ancient Chinese poetry, there have been instances of comparing a feudal ruler to one's husband and oneself to a concubine, or a neglected concubine. However, "loyalty to the ruler" does not equate to "patriotism." Lu Xun, from his youth, was a rebel against feudalism and would not have used foreign allusions or had such feudal scholar-official sentiments in such a way.

　　鲁迅的自题小像诗
    杨宪益
    鲁迅早期的自题小像诗是大家都熟悉的，诗是一首七言绝句：“灵台无计逃神矢，风雨如磐闇故园，寄意寒星荃不察，我以我血荐轩辕。”这是鲁迅才到日本留学时写的，据许寿裳说，这首诗是鲁迅在１９０３年寄给他的，但鲁迅后来记忆是他２１岁时写的，也就是在１９０２年年初。关于这首诗的内容解释，总的来说，大家都没有什么不同意见，这当然是年轻时的鲁迅最早的爱国誓言，可以说它奠定了他以后一生的道路和政治方向。诗中第二句“风雨如磐”出自诗经，第三句的“寒星”和“荃不察”出自楚辞，“轩辕”即黄帝，是中国祖先的象征。这些都没有什么问题。“风雨如磐”当然不是指真的风雨，而是说祖国当时正处于被外国帝国主义列强压迫之下，这也是很容易理解的。
    只是诗的第一行后来却引起了一些不必要的误解。后来注释家往往认为“灵台”指心，“神矢”是西方爱神的箭，我却一直认为这是完全错误的。文革前我曾对一些研究鲁迅的朋友们说过我的意见，但因国内先有了过去权威说法，我的解释一直未引起足够重视。我还觉得应该申说一下。
    “灵台”指心，说见庄子庚桑楚“不可内于灵台”。实际上这是战国时人引伸的意思。“灵台”一词早见于诗经，是指周文王修建的观象台。这个灵台是实有还是古代传说，这只能有待于将来考古工作者去解决，反正自周朝一统中原以来，相传都说有这么一个地方，是天下的中心。诗大雅里灵台是篇名，是歌颂周文王的诗。郑玄笺谓“文王受命而作邑于丰，立灵台”。又见《孟子·梁惠王上》，“文王以民力为台为沼，而民欢乐之，谓其台为灵台”。到了战国时代，轩辕黄帝的神话开始流行，轩辕黄帝成为中国各民族的祖先，灵台又成为轩辕黄帝之台。从战国到秦汉，在古代天文学和医学里，灵台既是中央的天文观象台，又引伸为天上的星名和人体的中心，所以庄子才以灵台为心的代名词，汉代的三辅黄图里就以中央的观象台名为灵台，晋书天文志也说“明堂西三星曰灵台，观台也，主观云物”。反正到了战国以后，灵台就是轩辕黄帝之台，人体上指心也好，天文上指星也好，都是中央的象征，周文王的传说已经为轩辕黄帝取代了。
    灵台既然指轩辕黄帝之台，“灵台无计逃神矢”这一句就很好解决。鲁迅年幼时是很喜欢读山海经的。大荒西经里说，“有轩辕之台，射者不敢西向，畏轩辕之台”。海外西经也说，“穷山在其北，不敢西射，畏轩辕之丘”，郭璞注曰，“敬难黄帝之神”，郝懿行注曰，“台亦丘也”，看来古代人认为中国四方都有不少妖神，但它们都害怕轩辕黄帝，不敢向轩辕的灵台射箭。山海经里也提到共工之台，也是说各地妖神不敢向灵台射箭，如大荒北经里说，“有共工之台，射者不敢北向”。海外北经也说，“相柳者九首人面蛇身而青，不敢北射，畏共工之台”，都是一个意思，因为共工在古代神话里也是个与帝争霸的君主。
    鲁迅这首诗末句既然说“我以我血荐轩辕”，用的典故当然指的是古代神话里轩辕之台，那样第一句应该用的是同一典故，意思也就是指祖国当时已处于风雨飘摇的黑暗时代，四方妖神也就是说帝国主义列强，已不再害怕黄帝的威灵，都敢向灵台攻击了。鲁迅这首诗写成的时代正是帝国主义列强纷纷向中国进攻的那些年。
    过去不少人认为“神矢”是指西方神话中爱神之箭，这是完全讲不通的。爱国感情同男女之恋完全是两回事，在希腊罗马神话里，两者是不能混淆的。鲁迅对西方文学也不外行，不可能作出这样的比喻。在中国古代诗歌里，倒有过把封建君王比作自己的丈夫，把自己比作臣妾，或者说失宠的小老婆的，但是“忠君”也还并不等于“爱国”，鲁迅从青年时代起就是反封建的闯将，他不会那样乱用外国典故或者有那样的封建士大夫感情的。
