Individual households in education should pay taxes according to law. In our county's Shui Guan District, many individual business households only care about making money and try every means to avoid paying taxes. According to an investigation, from last May to December, among the 721 individual households in this district, more than 60% evaded taxes, and the amount of taxes evaded exceeded the amount that should have been paid by 50%. One individual business household, from 1985 to November 1988, made a pure profit of over 50,000 yuan, but the local tax collection personnel only collected 15 yuan in income tax from him.

The main reasons why individual business households evade national taxes are: some individual business households have a very weak sense of tax payment, believing that the money they earn should belong to themselves. In some places, the tax collection and management forces are weak, and combined with the fact that some individual business households use various methods to evade taxes and the scope of evasion is large, it is difficult for the tax authorities to handle. In some places, the quality of tax personnel is low, and law enforcement is not strict.

It is suggested that relevant departments, in the process of rectifying the economic environment and economic order, should take the issue of investigating and dealing with individual business households evading taxes as an important content. The public security, industry and commerce, and tax departments should work together to bring those who evade taxes seriously to justice, so as to demonstrate the power of tax law. At the same time, propaganda and education work should be done well for the majority of individual business households to improve their awareness of paying taxes according to law.

　　教育个体户依法纳税
    我县水观区不少个体工商户只顾赚钱，千方百计找空子逃避纳税。据调查，去年５月到１２月，仅这个区的７２１家个体户中，偷漏税的达６０％以上，偷漏税额超过应纳税额的５０％。有一个体工商户，从１９８５年到１９８８年１１月，获纯利５万多元，但当地征管人员只收到他１５元所得税。
    个体工商户偷漏国家税款的主要原因是：有的个体工商户纳税观念十分淡薄，认为自己赚的钱应该归自己。有的地方税收部门的征管力量薄弱，加上一些个体工商户偷漏税手段多样，偷漏面又大，税务机关很难查处。有的地方税务人员素质低，执法不严。
    建议有关部门在治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序中，把查处个体工商户偷漏税的问题作为一项重要内容。公安、工商和税务部门要通力合作，对那些偷漏税严重的“钉子户”，必须绳之以法，以体现税法的威力。同时，要对广大个体工商户做好宣传教育工作，提高他们依法纳税的自觉性。
