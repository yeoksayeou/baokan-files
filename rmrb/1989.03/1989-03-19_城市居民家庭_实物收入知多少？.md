Last year, the urban sampling survey team in Dalian conducted a survey on the "third-quarter income in kind" for 300 households. The results showed:

There were 159 households with income in kind, totaling 17,868 yuan in value for the year, averaging 59.56 yuan per household. According to this, the ratio of monetary income to income in kind in the total monthly per capita living expenses for the third quarter was 19.5 to 1. Among the 159 households, 41 had income in kind valued at less than 50 yuan, 73 had income in kind valued between 50 and 100 yuan, and 11 had income in kind valued at more than 200 yuan. The household with the least income in kind had 8 yuan, while the household with the most had 2,000 yuan.

The forms and types of goods that workers receive from their units are diverse, including protective, consolation, commemorative, reward, and gift items; some are distributed at meetings, while others are delivered to homes.

However, if classified by funding sources, they can be mainly divided into two categories: labor protection items and welfare supplementary items, with their value proportions being 21.1% and 78.9%, respectively. Among the labor protection items, workers no longer just receive items like soap, towels, gloves, and various plain cotton or canvas clothing. High-quality items such as wool suits, raincoats, ski jackets, and overcoats are also commonly seen. Among the welfare supplementary items, scarce "hot commodities" and local specialties are prevalent. Among these, the value of food items is the highest, accounting for 45.5% of all items.

　　城市居民家庭
    实物收入知多少？
    去年大连市城市抽样调查队对３００户居民家庭进行了“三季度实物收入”调查，结果表明：
    有实物收入的为１５９户，年获得实物价值为１７８６８元，平均每户为５９．５６元，据此计算，三季度在居民人均月生活费总收入中，货币收入与实物收入之比为１９．５比１。１５９户中，所得实物价值在５０元以下的为４１户，在５０—１００元之间的为７３户，在２００元以上的为１１户，其中最少的一户为８元，最多的一户为２０００元。
    职工从单位分得实物的名义和形式多种多样，有劳动保护性的，也有慰问性的、纪念性的、奖励性的、赠送性的；有会上发的，也有送到家的。
    但若按资金渠道划分，主要可分为劳保用品和福利性补贴物品两大类，二者价值所占的比重分别为２１．１％和７８．９％。在劳保用品中，职工所领取到的已不再仅仅是肥皂、毛巾、手套和不讲究款式的各种棉、帆布服装之类的物品了，做工考究的毛料西装、风雨衣、滑雪衫、呢大衣等高档穿着也屡见不鲜。在福利性补贴实物中，以市场上短缺的“紧俏物资”和“土特产品”居多。其中副食品的价值量居各类商品之首，占４５．５％。
