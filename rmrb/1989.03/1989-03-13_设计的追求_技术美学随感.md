Wangfujing Street can be considered one of the premier commercial streets in our capital. Both domestic and international tourists who visit Beijing usually make a point to stop by. Whether it's the scorching summer or the cold winter, the street is always bustling with people. On sunny days, many tired tourists often sit on the railings of the sidewalks, or even gather in groups to sit on the ground in the corners of buildings, which is rather unsightly. This is understandable, as a long commercial street lacks any benches for people to rest. The railings and boundary markers on the sidewalks are merely used as barriers to prevent people from crossing. Thus, although the street is bustling, it still gives off a cold and indifferent atmosphere. The indifference towards individuals in feudal times is still reflected in today's product design. Due to a lack of consideration for human activities, the environment loses its warm and friendly ambiance. If we just consider a bit more about convenience and add some design, some railings can serve both as boundary markers and as seats. Unfortunately, many products, although designed for people, do not pay attention to more of their needs. I recall in the film "China's Unique," it recorded how some farmers ingeniously used bicycles to carry people and goods, which was truly a unique skill, but also quite dangerous. Since bicycles are such an important means of transportation in our country, why not design various attachments for bicycles that are convenient for carrying children and goods, instead of relying on people to master those difficult and dangerous skills? This precisely reflects the neglect of design concepts in our country. We often follow the complex labor and living methods passed down through generations, and are not good at using product and environmental design to effectively improve the quality of life.

The emphasis on product and environmental design is almost a common characteristic of all industrialized countries, and the focus on people in design is so clearly demonstrated. Product design may not be as dramatic as political events, but in Britain, it has attracted the attention of the Prime Minister. Mrs. Thatcher once held a seminar on "Product Design and Market Success" at 10 Downing Street and pointed out: "Design is the foundation of our industrial future," and "Excellent design is the mark of a successful enterprise." This July, Japan will hold an international design exhibition in Nagoya, and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry aims to make 1989 the Year of Design in Japan. Of course, Japan's emphasis on design is not new. As early as the 1950s, when Japan's economy took off, a businessman who returned from the United States, Matsushita, said at the airport: "The future is the era of design." From imitating American and European products to innovative design, this is a turning point for Japanese products to occupy the international market.

In modern industrial production, design has become the leading link. Design, through the creation of structure and form, integrates the progress of science and technology, society, and culture into the development of product functions. Therefore, it has become the fundamental way to develop material culture. Technical beauty is the direct presentation of the appearance and form of a product to its function, allowing people to perceive themselves through the material world. The beauty of a sofa, for example, is first seen in how comfortable it looks to sit on. Additionally, its texture, color, shape, and style should also be in harmony with the use and environment. If the design does not meet the functional purpose, and it looks inconvenient to use, then no matter how elaborate the decoration and appearance, it still looks ugly. Because people's aesthetic perception of products and practical environments is centered on functionality. Technical beauty embodies the goal pursued by industrial design, and its essence lies in fully satisfying human needs. Only through continuous innovation can products become effective tools for human activities with a human touch. This is the essence of what is known abroad as "human-centered design."

### 设计的追求——技术美学随感

　　设计的追求
    ——技术美学随感
    徐恒醇
    王府井大街可以算是我国首都第一流的商业街了，凡是到过北京的国内外游人，总要去光顾一遭。无论炎热的盛夏，还是寒冷的隆冬，街上的人群始终络绎不绝。风和日暖时，许多走累了的游人往往就跨在便道的护栏上，甚至在建筑物的墙角成群地席地而坐，不免大煞风景。这也难怪，一条长长的商业街，却找不到一个可以歇脚的凳椅，而那些便道的护栏和境界物只是用作防范人们逾越的障碍物。因此，街市虽然繁华，依旧给人一种冷漠的感觉；封建时代对人自身的漠视，依然在当今时代的产品设计中不时反映出来，由于缺乏对人们活动的适应性的关注，从而使环境失去了亲切宜人的氛围。其实只要稍稍考虑一下予人方便，稍加设计，有些护栏就可以发挥既是境界物又是座椅的双重功能。可惜许多产品虽然是为人设计的，却不注意人的更多需要。记得在《中国一绝》的影片中，记录了一些农民是怎样巧妙地运用自行车去携人载物的，真是技绝于世，然而又令人提心吊胆。既然自行车在我国是如此重要的交通工具，为什么不可以设计出各种便于携童载物的自行车附件，而只靠人们去磨练那些艰难而危险的技巧呢？这些恰恰反映出在我们这里设计观念的淡漠。我们往往因袭世代相传的繁复劳动方式和生活方式，而不善于运用产品和环境的设计有效地改善生活的质量。
    对于产品和环境设计的重视几乎是所有工业发达国家的共同特点，对人的重视在设计中是如此明显地呈示出来。产品设计也许不像具有戏剧性的政治事件那样耸人听闻，然而在英国仍然引起了首相的极大关注。撒切尔夫人曾经在唐宁街１０号举办了“产品设计与市场的成功”研究班，并且指出：“设计是我们工业前途的根本”，“优异的设计是成功的企业的标志”。今年７月份，日本将在名古屋举办国际性设计博览会，通产省要使１９８９年成为日本的设计年。当然，在日本对设计的重视非自今日始。早在５０年代日本经济起飞之际，从美国回到日本的一位企业家松下在机场的第一句话就是：今后是设计的时代。从对美欧产品的仿制走向匠心独运的设计，是日本产品占领国际市场的一个转机。
    在现代工业生产中，设计已经成了生产的主导环节。设计是通过结构与形式的创造，把科学技术的、社会和文化的进步融合到产品功能的开拓中，因此，成为发展物质文化的根本途径。技术美是产品的外观和形式对产品功能的直观呈现，使人们通过物质世界去直观自身。一个沙发的美首先是使人看上去感到坐着很舒适，此外它的质地、色彩、造型和风格还要与使用和环境相协调。设计如果不符合功能目的，一看就觉得使用不便，那么不论怎样讲究装饰和外观，看起来也是不美的。因为人对产品和实用环境的审美感受，它的价值取向是以功能为中心的。技术美体现了工业设计所追求的目标，它的实质在于全面地满足人的需要，只有通过不断的创新，才能使产品成为具有人情味的人类活动的有效工具。这就是国外所称道的“人性化的设计”的真谛。
