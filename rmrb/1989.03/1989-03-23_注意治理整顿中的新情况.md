The rectification and rectification have shown initial results, but at the same time, some new situations and new problems have emerged. To achieve the expected results of the rectification and rectification, we not only need to focus on the main tasks of the rectification and rectification and strive to achieve real results, but also need to pay attention to understanding new situations and solving new problems.

To control inflation, it is completely necessary to tighten monetary policy. However, after tightening monetary policy, the situation of a significant decrease in enterprise deposits has emerged. Some enterprises withdraw their deposits to support projects or use funds to bypass banks to avoid being "restricted." Some large and medium-sized enterprises face a serious shortage of working capital, while some small enterprises, individual businesses, and private enterprises use "external circulation" to conduct large-scale cash transactions. Banks cannot timely recover cash, resulting in the situation where white slips have to be issued to farmers when purchasing agricultural and sideline products.

It is completely necessary to curb economic overheating. From recent statistics, the rate of rapid growth has decreased. This should be affirmed. However, it is noteworthy that the irrational industrial structure in some places has even worsened. The growth rate and economic benefits of large and medium-sized enterprises, which play a major role in ensuring effective supply and state fiscal revenue, have decreased significantly, while the development of small enterprises in some places remains quite hot. This continues to tilt the already skewed structure.

It is completely necessary to reduce the scale of construction projects. From the current situation, the expected target has not been reached. However, due to some projects being halted, the problem of how to arrange the surplus labor force has emerged.

And so on, these are all issues that need to be addressed in a timely manner.

The emergence of new problems in the rectification and rectification is inevitable and does not warrant surprise. Measures such as cooling down, compressing, tightening, and adjusting will inevitably change the operation of our economy, and changes mean that new situations and new problems will emerge. Subjectively, our rectification measures have a process of formulation, coordination, implementation, and improvement, and many measures often have both positive and negative effects. Objectively, the current economic environment is one of two systems coexisting and alternating, and economic life has two "operating rules." Rectification measures often face the challenge of treating two diseases with one prescription. For example, when compressing construction projects, planned projects are generally more important but easier to halt; unplanned projects have greater randomness but are difficult to halt outside the plan. Tightening monetary policy also has similar situations. It is easier to tighten the large and medium-sized enterprises that play a key role, but the scattered individual businesses and small enterprises can take advantage of the "tighten here, loosen there" loopholes to gain new opportunities for expansion. Our macro-control measures are temporarily unable to adapt to this situation, and it is difficult to quickly deliver the medicine where the disease is, even leading to the situation where the healthy eat medicine and the sick escape.

We emphasize the need to pay attention to new situations and new problems, not to say that the rectification and rectification policies themselves have any problems, nor to say that the emergence of new problems means that the rectification and rectification should be stopped or slowed down. On the contrary, effectively removing obstacles and taking timely measures is precisely to ensure that the rectification and rectification are carried out firmly and resolutely, and will not stop until the expected goals are achieved.

　　注意治理整顿中的新情况
    本报评论员
    治理整顿已初见成效，同时，也出现了一些新情况、新问题。要想使治理整顿取得预期的效果，我们不仅需要抓住治理整顿的主要任务不放，务求抓出实效，而且还要注意了解新情况，解决新问题。
    为了治理通货膨胀，收紧银根是完全必要的。但收紧银根之后，出现了企业存款大幅度下降的情况，一些企业把存款提出，用于保项目，或者用款绕开银行，以免被“卡”。一些大中型企业出现了流动资金严重不足的情况，而一些小企业、个体户、私人企业，却利用“体外循环”，用大量现钞进行交易。银行不能及时回笼票子，以致出现收购农副产品时不得不给农民打白条。
    压缩经济过热是完全必要的，从最近的统计数字看，过快的增长速度已经有所下降。这是应该肯定的。但是值得注意的是，工业结构不合理的情况在某些地方甚至有所发展。对保障有效供给、对保障国家财政收入起主要作用的大中型企业产值增长速度和经济效益下降较多，而有些地方小企业发展仍然相当热。这就使本来倾斜的结构继续倾斜。
    压缩基建规模是完全必要的，从现在看，还远远没有达到预想的目标。但由于一些项目下马，又出现了剩余劳力如何安排的问题。
    如此等等，都是需要及时加以注意的。
    治理整顿中又出现新问题，带有某种必然性，并不值得大惊小怪。降温、压缩、收紧、调整等等措施，必然使我国的经济运行有所变化，而变化就意味着会有新情况、新问题出现。从主观上看，我们的整治措施，有一个制订、配套、贯彻、完善的过程，而且许多措施又常常是正副作用并存的。从客观上看，现在的经济环境是两种体制并存和交替，经济生活存在着两种“运行规则”，整治措施往往是一付药难治两种病。例如压缩基建，计划内的项目一般比较重要，却容易压下来；计划外项目盲目性较大，但它在计划外却难以压下来。收紧银根也有类似情况，起骨干作用的大中型企业收紧较易，而相当分散的个体户、小企业却可利用“你紧我松”的空子获得新的膨胀的机会。我们的宏观调控手段，又一时难适应这种情况，不能很快做到哪儿有病药就到哪儿去，甚至出现无病者吃药，有病者脱逃的情况。
    我们提出要注意新情况、新问题，决不是说治理、整顿的方针本身出了什么问题，也不是说出现了新问题，治理整顿应该停止或放慢；恰恰相反，有效地扫除障碍，适时地采取措施，正是为了把治理整顿坚定不移地抓下去，不达预期目的，决不罢休。
