The European Free Trade Association (EFTA) summit of six countries concluded this noon in Oslo. The meeting issued a statement emphasizing that EFTA will further strengthen cooperation with the European Community (EC) and make efforts to establish a unified European Economic Area.

The meeting reviewed the progress made since the "Luxembourg Declaration" in 1984, which set the goal of achieving a "unified and dynamic European Economic Area." EFTA and the EC have made strides in the free circulation of industrial goods, the elimination of tariffs and quantitative restrictions, the simplification of regulations and customs procedures, and the formulation of technical standards and safety and health regulations. These achievements have strengthened the trade partnership already established between the two organizations.

The meeting noted that "EFTA and the EC face a common challenge in establishing a European Economic Area." Both sides need to further strengthen the special relationship already established on the basis of equal rights and obligations.

EFTA will respond positively to the EC President Jacques Delors' proposal for establishing a joint cooperation mechanism between the two organizations.

However, from the information provided at the press conference, it appears that EFTA member countries still have differences on issues such as the free circulation of agricultural products and the establishment of a customs union with the EC.

　　欧洲自由贸易联盟首脑会议声明
    与欧共体共建欧洲经济区
    本报奥斯陆３月１５日电  记者顾耀铭报道：欧洲自由贸易联盟（以下简称联盟）６国首脑会议今天中午在这里闭幕。会议发表的声明强调，联盟将与欧共体进一步加强合作，为建立统一的欧洲经济区作出努力。
    会议回顾了自１９８４年“卢森堡宣言”确立的实现“统一的、有活力的欧洲经济区”目标以来，联盟与欧共体在工业品的自由流通、取消关税和数量限制、简化规定和关税程序、制订技术规定及安全健康标准等方面所取得的进展，认为这些进展使两个组织早已建立的贸易伙伴关系得到了加强。
    会议指出，“联盟与欧共体在建立欧洲经济区问题上面临着共同的挑战”。双方需要在权利和义务平等的基础上进一步加强已建立的特殊关系。
    联盟对欧共体主席德洛尔关于两个组织间建立共同合作机构的建议将作出积极反应。
    但从记者招待会上介绍的情况看，联盟成员国在与欧共体的农产品自由流通、建立关税联盟等问题上尚存在分歧。
