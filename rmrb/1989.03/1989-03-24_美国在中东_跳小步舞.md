The United States' policy towards Middle Eastern affairs has been described by the media as a "small step" policy, and it is estimated that this policy will be maintained for quite some time.

The initial outline of this transitional policy was revealed to the public by President Bush after his meeting with the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and Israel in Tokyo. According to Bush, the United States is "not in a hurry" and "will not rush into action." According to information from Washington, Egyptian President Mubarak will meet with President Bush on April 3, Israeli Prime Minister Shamir will visit the White House on April 6, and Jordanian King Hussein will follow on May 2. It seems that President Bush is methodically taking on his role and listening to relevant opinions.

Prior to this, Israeli Foreign Minister Arens took the lead by visiting Washington first. The United States clearly demanded that Israel change its approach and ease the tense standoff in the occupied territories. It is said that the U.S. government has "learned from past lessons," and therefore adopted a low-profile stance, "wanting Israel and the Palestinians to decide on the plans and timing for achieving peace themselves."

What are the past lessons? The White House summarized it as follows: All parties involved in the Middle East conflict have urged the United States to quickly come up with a plan and take action, but whenever the White House makes a move, it is either opposed by the Arab side or rejected by Israel. Now, the White House has decided to do the opposite. "You (referring to Israelis and Palestinians) are the ones who must come up with ideas and take action," which is why the United States is so active in promoting direct dialogue between the two sides.

The Bush administration's decision to dance a "small step" is partly due to the fact that its Middle East policy has not yet been fully formed, but the objective external situation also allows it to adopt a more detached posture. First, U.S.-Soviet relations are easing, and the two countries' competition for diplomatic leadership in the Middle East "will not exceed certain limits." Moreover, it will take time for the Soviet Union to truly achieve a position of equality with the United States. Second, the United States has opened a channel of dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, and as long as the U.S.-PLO dialogue does not break off, it can reap the benefits of "restoring its reputation." Third, both Western Europe and the Soviet Union are actively engaged in the Middle East, and it is better to "observe the situation" and let them come to the United States.

The Middle East problem is complex. According to U.S. publications, the Bush administration is determined to proceed with caution, but it will not let go, especially not to the Soviet Union. The core of the United States' future Middle East policy includes three aspects of "parallel actions": For the Palestinians and the Arab side, encourage their moderate negotiating tendencies, using the continuation of U.S.-PLO dialogue as a lever to pressure the PLO to stop and reduce the scale of the "stone uprising" in the occupied territories; For Israel, "soften" its high-pressure policy towards the Palestinians, and under the condition of not touching Israel's "fundamental interests," promote its acceptance of the "land for peace" strategic choice; For Western Europe and the Soviet Union, adopt a "wait and see" attitude.

Regarding the highly advocated Middle East peace international conference, the White House's attitude appears to be neither cold nor warm, but in essence, it believes that the timing is not yet ripe. The recent meeting between the foreign ministers of the United States and the Soviet Union in Vienna to discuss Middle East issues reportedly reached a consensus on one point: the starting point of the political process to resolve the Middle East problem does not necessarily have to be the immediate convening of the Middle East conference, but can be based on U.S.-PLO dialogue, U.S.-Israel negotiations, and even Soviet-Israeli dialogue, to first achieve direct negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis. This is also the true meaning of Baker's statement, "You take the first step."

The United States has become more cautious on the Middle East political stage, which cannot be said to be entirely passive, especially as it has begun to seriously consider the interests of the Palestinian people. However, if Shamir continues to sing out of tune and emit discordant noises, then the White House should take some measures to keep the slow and steady small step dance going.

### 美国在中东“跳小步舞”

　　美国在中东“跳小步舞”
    本报记者  林皎明
    美国对中东事务的政策，舆论界称之为“跳小步舞”的政策，而且估计会维持相当一段时间。
    这一过渡政策的最初轮廓，是布什总统在东京与埃及、约旦、以色列３国领导人会晤后透露给外界的。照布什的话说，美国在中东“不着急”，“不会仓促上阵”。据来自华盛顿的消息证实，埃及总统穆巴拉克将于４月３日与布什总统会谈，以色列总理沙米尔４月６日拜访白宫，约旦国王侯赛因５月２日接踵访美。看来，布什总统正在有条不紊地进入角色，听取有关意见。
    在此之前，以色列外长阿伦斯先行一步，首访华盛顿。美国明确要求以色列改变作法，缓和一下被占领土的紧张对峙局面，据说，美国政府“接受以往的教训”，因此采取低姿态，“要以色列和巴勒斯坦自己决定实现和平的计划和时机”。
    以往的教训究竟是什么？白宫这样总结：中东争端各方都催促美国尽快拿出方案、采取行动，但每当白宫一有动作，不是遭到阿拉伯一方的异议，就是被以色列拒绝。现在，白宫索性来个反其道而行之。“你们（指以色列人和巴勒斯坦人）才是必须拿出主意、采取行动的人”，这就是为什么美国对促使巴以直接对话表现如此积极。
    布什政府现在要跳小步舞，固然有其中东政策尚未最后形成的原因，而客观外界形势在某种程度上也允许它采取比以往较超脱的态势。其一，美苏两国关系趋于缓和，两家在中东争夺外交主导权“不至于超出一定界限”。而且，苏联真正取得与美国“平起平坐”的地位，也非一朝一夕之功。其二，美国已经打开与巴勒斯坦解放组织对话的渠道，只要美巴对话不中断便可坐收给美国带来“恢复声誉”的好处。其三，西欧和苏联都在中东积极活动，与其站到前台另树旗帜，不如“静观态势，让他们找上门来”。
    中东问题错综复杂，据美国报刊透露，布什政府决心谨慎行事，但是绝不放手，尤其不让苏联“下手”。美国未来中东政策的核心，包括３个方面的“平行行动”：对巴勒斯坦和阿拉伯方面，鼓励其温和和谈倾向，以继续美巴对话为砝码，压巴解停止和减弱被占领土“石头起义”的规模；对以色列，“软化”其对巴勒斯坦的高压政策，在不触及以色列“根本利益”的条件下，促使它接受“以土地换取和平”的战略选择；对西欧和苏联，采取“走着瞧”的态度。
    对于呼声甚高的中东和平国际会议，看起来白宫的态度不冷不热，实际上骨子里认为时机仍不成熟。美苏两国外长最近在维也纳会谈中东问题，据说在一点上有默契，即政治解决中东问题进程的起点，并不一定拘泥于中东和会首先召开，而可以在美巴对话、美以谈判，甚至苏以对话的基础上，首先实现巴以的直接谈判。这也正是贝克宣称“你们先采取行动”的真正所指。
    美国在中东政治舞台上变得谨慎，不能说都是消极的，尤其是开始认真看待巴勒斯坦人民利益。但是，如果沙米尔总是唱反调，总是发出不协调的噪音，那么白宫总该采取点什么办法让不紧不慢的小步舞跳得下去。
