Visiting the tombs of revolutionary martyrs should be done with a reverent and solemn heart. However, nowadays, some people treat these tombs as mere scenic spots, laughing and joking around, showing no respect at all. Have these people ever considered the feelings of the revolutionary martyrs in their graves? Have they ever wondered why the tombs of revolutionary martyrs are not properly managed?

The photograph shows an individual photographer taking pictures for customers.

    如此照相
    瞻仰革命烈士墓本应带着崇敬、严肃的心情，但现在有些人却把烈士墓看作风景，嘻嘻哈哈，大不恭敬。不知这些人玩乐之中可曾想到九泉之下的革命烈士，不知革命烈士墓为何没有人管理？
