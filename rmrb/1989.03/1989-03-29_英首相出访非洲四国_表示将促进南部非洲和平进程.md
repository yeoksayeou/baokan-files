Xinhua News Agency, London, March 27th.

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today departed from London to begin her six-day visit to Africa. She will visit Morocco, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, and Malawi, and will meet with Mozambican President Chissano in Zimbabwe.

During this trip, Thatcher will hold talks with the leaders of the host countries on bilateral relations, the Arab-Israeli conflict, the situation in Southern Africa, and opposition to apartheid.

Prior to her departure, Thatcher expressed her intention to promote the peace process in Southern Africa and to assist in convening a conference for Southern African countries to resolve conflicts between frontline states and South Africa. When discussing South Africa, she stated that she would not visit the country until there are positive changes and Nelson Mandela is released. She reiterated her demand for universal suffrage in South Africa, believing that this would pave the way for peaceful negotiations between the South African government and black leaders within the country.

　　英首相出访非洲四国        
    表示将促进南部非洲和平进程
    新华社伦敦３月２７日电  英国首相撒切尔夫人今天离开伦敦，开始她为期６天的非洲之行。她将先后访问摩洛哥、尼日利亚、津巴布韦和马拉维，并在津巴布韦会见莫桑比克总统希萨诺。
    撒切尔夫人这次访非将分别同东道国的领导人就双边关系、阿以冲突、南部非洲问题及反对种族隔离等问题进行会谈。
    撒切尔夫人在此行前夕曾表示，她将促进南部非洲地区的和平进程，协助召开南部非洲地区大会，以解决前线国家同南非之间的冲突。她在谈到南非问题时还表示，在南非发生积极的变化和曼德拉先生获释之前，她将不去南非访问。她还重申，她要求南非进行全民投票。她认为，这将为南非当局同国内的黑人领袖举行和平谈判铺平道路。
