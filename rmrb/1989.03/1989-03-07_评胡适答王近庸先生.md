Title: Evaluating Hu Shi's Response to Mr. Wang Jinyong
Author: Yǐ Zhúxián

Edition: 8

I read Mr. Wang Jinyong's critique of my article titled "Also Discussing the Last Emperor and Hu Shi" (published in the January 24, 1989, edition of the _Dadi_ supplement) quite late. It was during the Spring Festival that a friend from the medical community, who is concerned about the literary world, mentioned it to me. I then found and read it, skimming through it and finding the article's intent and methods somewhat familiar.

The author's first move was to label the opponent with a so-called "180-degree turnaround." Although it doesn't compare to the earlier movements and the imposition of terrifying charges, it still has a rather aggressive tone. However, today is not the era of "following the line," and people are no longer swayed by such tactics. My article "From the Last Emperor and Hu Shi to..." was written in an environment of reform and opening up, discussing how to evaluate Hu Shi, a cultural figure. Naturally, it would not follow the same tune as the anti-Hu campaign of the 1950s but would instead be based on reality and seek truth from facts. How many degrees of turn should be made, that many degrees of turn should be made. Didn't Wang's article also say that Hu Shi was a "scholar with great contributions"? So, from the "academic fraud" of the 1950s to the "scholar with great contributions" of the 1980s, how many degrees of turn is that? Should it be turned or not? Is it a genuine turn or a fake one?

My short piece clearly states: "Hu Shi also has flaws and mistakes"; and explicitly points out that "Hu Shi's later years of following the Nationalist government and opposing the People's Republic of China are naturally his major mistakes." Yet, Wang's article ignores the facts and insists on labeling it as "leaning to one side," "no flaws or mistakes can be mentioned," "either all good or all bad," as "stale metaphysics," and the hats are about to fly again. This is creating something out of nothing, turning something into nothing, the first trick.

For example, I compared the cultural figures Wang Guowei, Liang Qichao, and Yan Fu with Hu Shi, whether they are worthy of emulation or not, let's not discuss it for now. In it, I mentioned their political attitudes: "Wang was loyal to the deposed 'emperor,' Liang was enthusiastic about preserving the monarchy, and Yan was listed in the 'Anfu Club,' advocating for Yuan Shikai's restoration of the empire." These are historical facts that are not very old. Yet, Wang's article openly deletes the sentence about "Yan," puts the blame on Liang, and criticizes me for "summarizing Liang Qichao's advocacy for Yuan Shikai's restoration of the empire in one sentence, which seems unfair." This is moving flowers and grafting branches, the second trick.

Moreover, quoting the words of leaders, classic writers, or Lu Xun, without considering the context, and then claiming victory. I have always been very disgusted with the trick of using quotations to fight.

As for the issue of evaluating Hu Shi, I only mentioned a few of his pioneering contributions and his biggest mistake, very briefly, just to throw out a brick to attract a jade, hoping for academic discussion and criticism. If Mr. Wang can provide guidance in this area, it would be very welcome. Regarding the television series "The Last Emperor," I had no intention of criticizing it; I just used it as a starting point. The term "mockery" indeed reveals my dissatisfaction with the handling of this scene. A historical drama, in a certain segment of the plot, writes about a certain minor character, naturally cannot be said to be a comprehensive evaluation of that character; writing about a character's mistakes does not necessarily mean that the character's historical achievements must be fully displayed, this is common sense. However, the director's handling of a certain minor character must have a basic evaluation of that character as a premise, in order to depict that character. This is also common sense. In recent years, many dramas (including "The Last Emperor") have shown Chiang Kai-shek, who appears as a minor character, no longer in a caricatured way, which is precisely the result of a change in the basic evaluation of Chiang. As an audience, I feel that the "little emperor" in "The Last Emperor" is portrayed as so elegant and suave, responding appropriately; while the new figure of the time, Hu Shi, appears so dull and helpless, the grasp of the character's identity cannot be said to be very accurate. Whether this feeling is correct or not can be subject to criticism; but how can it be concluded that no flaws or mistakes can be mentioned? The article mentions that the "emperor" summoned Hu Shi "which is historically documented," which is evidence. Incidentally, I used the term "summoned"; "summoned" seems inappropriate, and "Puyi summoned Hu Shi to the Forbidden City" is even more inappropriate.

The publication of critical and counter-critical articles in _Dadi_ proves that the wind of freedom of speech is very good and is of great benefit to the healthy development of reform and opening up and academic discussion.

　　评胡适答王近庸先生
    易竹贤
    我看到王近庸先生批评我的题为《也谈末代皇帝和胡适》（载１９８９年１月２４日《大地》副刊）的文章已经很晚了，是春节期间一位关心文坛的医界朋友来信提起的。于是找来翻阅，浏览一过，觉得文章的命意和手法似曾相识。
    作者劈头第一招，便是加给对手一个所谓“一百八十度大转弯”。虽然比不得早年的什么运动和扣上什么吓人的大罪名，却也颇有咄咄逼人之势。殊不知今日已经不是“为纲”之日，人们不吃那一套。我那篇《从末代皇帝与胡适说开去》，既然是在改革开放的环境下来谈如何评价胡适这位文化名人的问题，自然不会与五十年代批胡运动唱同一个调子，而只能是从实际出发，实事求是。该转多少度的弯，便转多少度的弯。王文不是也说胡适是一位“有很大贡献的学者”吗？试问，从５０年代的“学术骗子”到８０年代“有很大贡献的学者”，算是转多少度的弯呢？该转还是不该转，真转还是假转呢？
    我那小文里明明写着：“胡适也有缺陷，有失误”；并明确指出“胡适晚年追随国民党政权，反对人民中国，自然是他的大错”。而王文竟闭眼不看事实，一口咬定是什么“一边倒”，“任何缺点、失误都不能提”，“要么好到底，要么坏到底”，是“陈腐的形而上学”，帽子又要飞起来了。此乃无中生有，将有化无，第一法也。
    再如，我曾将王国维、梁启超、严复三位文化名人与胡适比较，“足取”与否，见仁见智，姑且勿论。其中说到他们的政治态度：“王氏尽忠于退位了的‘皇上’，梁氏热中于保皇，严氏则列名于‘筹安会’，为袁世凯复辟帝制张目。”这都是年代不很早的历史事实。而王文却公然删断“严氏”一句，严冠梁戴，指责我“以梁启超‘为袁世凯复辟帝制张目’一言以蔽之，似欠公允”，此移花接木，断章取义，第二法也。
    此外，搬引领导人或经典作家或鲁迅的语录，不问情由，便得胜回朝。我一向十分厌恶用语录打仗的玩艺儿。
    至于胡适的评价问题，我只提到了他几个方面的开拓性贡献和最大的错误，非常简略，只是抛砖引玉，期盼学术界批评讨论。王先生如果在这方面赐教，自然十分欢迎。对于电视连续剧《末代皇帝》，我原无意批评，只是由它“说开去”而已。“戏弄”云云，确也流露出对这一情节处理的不满意。一部历史题材的影剧，在某一片断情节里写了某个次要人物，自然不能说是对这个人物的全面评价；写了某个人物的失误，也并非同时要把这个人物的历史功绩摆够，这当然是常识。然而，影剧的编导对某个次要人物的处理，却也必定有对这个人物的基本评价作为前提，借以描写这个人物，这难道不也是常识吗？在近几年的许多影剧（包括《末代皇帝》）里，作为次要人物出现的蒋介石，不再像过去那样漫画化，便正是对蒋氏的基本评价有所变化的结果。作为观众，我觉得《末代皇帝》中的小“皇上”表现得那般风流潇洒，应对自如；而当年的新人物胡适却一副呆头呆脑，无可奈何的怪相，把握人物的身份不能说是很准确的。这感觉对不对，可以反批评；却怎么也不能得出不能提任何缺点失误的结论，文中说到“皇上”约见胡适“于史有证”，便是明证。顺便说明，我使用的是“约见”；“召见”似不甚妥贴，“溥仪召见胡适进紫禁城”，更不成话。
    《大地》发表批评与反批评的争鸣文章证明言论自由之风甚好，于改革开放和学术讨论的健康发展，我想是大有裨益的。
