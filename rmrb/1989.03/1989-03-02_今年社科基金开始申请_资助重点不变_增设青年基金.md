Applications for the National Social Science Fund for this year begin today. The fund will continue to focus on supporting research projects that have significant practical and theoretical implications for China's modernization efforts, as well as those that are crucial for the development of various disciplines. Projects such as the philosophical reflection on socialist state reform practices, the issue of the warning line for imbalances between total demand and total supply, and the theory of state power constraints have been included in the project guidelines.

The 1989 project guidelines, released today, also stipulate the "Provisional Measures for the Youth Social Science Research Fund." Starting this year, 5 million yuan will be allocated annually to support young social science researchers who are not older than 39 years of age. However, this year will not propose specific guiding projects for the youth fund. Instead, it will follow the 1989 project guidelines, allowing for a broader range of project applications without restrictions. Through the efforts of young researchers, it is hoped that the aging trend of research projects can be reversed, and breakthroughs can be made in emerging disciplines.

It is reported that last year, 388 projects were supported with a total funding of over 6.21 million yuan. Additionally, 10 million yuan was specifically allocated for national condition surveys. Including continued projects from previous years and other funded projects, the total funding for 1988 amounted to 124.695 million yuan.

Applications for the fund will close on June 1st. It is noted that Chinese students and scholars studying or working abroad can also apply for this funding.

    今年社科基金开始申请
    资助重点不变　增设青年基金
    本报北京3月1日讯　记者李泓冰报道：本年度国家社会科学基金的申请工作从今天开始。社会主义国家改革实践的哲学反思、总需求与总供给不平衡的警戒线问题、国家权力制约理论等项目被列入课题指南，这表明资助重点仍放在对我国现代化建设具有重大实践意义和理论意义，以及对学科发展具有重要意义的研究课题上。
    今天发布的1989年课题指南，还规定了《青年社会科学研究基金试行办法》。自今年起，每年划出50万元用于资助不超过39岁的青年社会科学研究工作者。但今年不专门为之提出导向性课题，同样从1989年课题指南为依据，可不受其限制，在更广泛的领域提出课题申请。通过青年研究人员的努力，可望扭转课题项目老化的倾向，并对新兴学科的研究有所突破。
    据悉，去年对388个课题的资助金额达621万元以上，并专拨100万元用于国情调查，加上前几年延续课题和其它资助项目，1988年度共拨付资助金额1246.95万元。
    基金申请到6月1日截止。有关人士说，我国在国外学习、工作的留学生和学者亦可以申请此项资金。
