Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, March 5th.

Poor-quality glasses are flooding the market in Wuhan. This has caused serious concern among schools, parents, and society at large. Some parents are calling out: "Don't make things worse for children with poor vision."

According to a report, out of Wuhan's 900,000-plus middle and primary school students, over 400,000 wear glasses due to nearsightedness. During a recent visit to Wuhan, a reporter saw signs for "Eye Exam and Glasses Fitting, Ready in Minutes" everywhere, from main streets to alleys. Mobile glasses vendors are also common. The commerce department revealed that Wuhan currently has only three specialized glasses manufacturing plants. One of these has been closed for a year, another is on the brink of bankruptcy, and the third, due to its small factory and inadequate equipment, cannot meet market demand. Among the glasses currently on the market, those for teenagers are particularly poor in quality. Some lenses are even made of ordinary glass.

　　劣质眼镜充斥武汉
    人们呼吁：别给视力不好的孩子雪上加霜
    据新华社武汉３月５日电  （记者施勇峰、实习生王文）武汉市有２８万多中小学生戴的是劣质眼镜。这个市卫生防疫等部门在经过大量调查后，近日向记者披露了这个数字。
    劣质眼镜在武汉市场上泛滥成灾，引起了学校、学生家长和社会各界的严重不安，一些家长呼吁：再不能给视力不好的孩子雪上加霜了。
    据了解，现在武汉市９０多万中小学生中，有４０多万因眼睛近视戴上了眼镜。记者近来在武汉采访时，只见大街小巷、“验光配镜、立等可取”的招牌林立，游动眼镜摊贩随处可见。据工商部门介绍，现在武汉市仅有三家眼镜专业生产厂，其中一家已停业一年，有一家濒临破产，另一家由于厂房狭窄，设备不够完善，生产量远远不能满足市场需要。在目前市场上销售的眼镜中，青少年所用的眼镜质量尤为低劣，有的镜片材料竟是普通玻璃。
