Your newspaper published a letter from a reader titled "Shouldn't Cars Without Permits Be Checked?" on the fifth page of the November 19, 1988 issue. The higher-level Party Committee, Discipline Inspection Commission, and our division's Party Committee have paid great attention to this issue.

Upon investigation, it was found that in April 1988, a unit of our division stationed in Xian County, Henan Province, violated higher-level regulations and illegally purchased two refurbished cars without permits from Guangdong for 174,000 yuan. Later, the unit sold these two cars for 192,000 yuan, making a profit of 18,000 yuan. We have handled this matter as follows:

We have confiscated all illegal gains from the unit's purchase and sale of the cars. We have required the unit's main leaders and relevant personnel to make a deep self-criticism and apologize to the local industrial and commercial administrative department.

The division's Party Committee and Discipline Inspection Commission have decided to issue a circular criticizing this issue throughout the entire division and to inspect and rectify all production and operation units.

　　我师某部擅自购买轿车被处理
    你报１９８８年１１月１９日第五版刊登了《无准运证的轿车不该查吗？》的读者来信后，上级党委、纪委及我师党委十分重视这一问题。
    经查，１９８８年４月，我师驻河南确山县某部违犯上级规定，擅自用１７．４万元从广东购进两辆无准运证的翻修轿车。后来，这个部队又将这两辆车以１９．２万元的价格出售，获利１．８万元。我们对此作了如下处理：
    没收这个部队在买卖轿车中的一切非法所得。责成部队主要领导人和有关人员作出深刻检查，并向当地工商行政管理部门赔礼道歉。
    师党委、纪委决定将这一问题在全师范围内通报批评，对所有生产经营单位进行检查和整顿。
