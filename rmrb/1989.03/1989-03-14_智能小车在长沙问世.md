Intelligent Car Debuts in Changsha

CHANGSHA, March 13 (Xinhua) — An intelligent car developed by the National University of Defense Technology has recently achieved success. It can navigate automatically and avoid obstacles by changing direction when it detects them in front.

This intelligent car consists of drive, vision, ultrasonic obstacle avoidance, remote control, and communication systems. It is equipped with a camera and six microprocessors. Its main functions include: remote control, where the operator in the control room can control the car based on the television image; autonomous navigation, where the computer processes and extracts roadside information from the camera. Based on this information, the computer plans a path for the car to follow and avoids obstacles as needed.
