On December 18th of last year, I purchased a pair of red Oxford snow boots at the Jīnchéng Store inside the Xiǎndān Quàn Business Center in Beijing. The boots were manufactured by the Xīnhuá Plastique Factory in Shíshì, Fujian, and cost 26.50 yuan. I only wore these boots for a little over a week when the sole of one of them broke into three pieces. On January 15th, I wrote a letter to the factory to report this issue, but I have not received a response to this day.

　　短命的牛津雪地鞋
    去年１２月１８日，我在北京西单劝业场内的金城商店，买了一双福建石狮新华皮塑工艺一厂生产的红色牛津雪地鞋，售价２６．５０元。这双鞋我只穿了一个多星期，一只鞋底就断裂成三截。我于１月１５日给厂家写信反映情况，但迟迟不见回信。
