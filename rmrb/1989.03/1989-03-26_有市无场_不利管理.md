The article "Black-Hearted Scales" published on the third page of this newspaper on March 9th attracted the attention of relevant departments in Beijing. Recently, commercial management personnel from various districts in Beijing have conducted inspections and rectifications of street vendor markets, and the market order has improved to some extent. How can these problems be fundamentally solved? Comrade Ma Qingchun from the Commercial Management Office of the Chaoyang District Shuizhui Market wrote to this newspaper, stating:

A large number of merchants from outside the province have entered the capital, making the already crowded venues even more congested. The lack of market venues has led to many merchants setting up stalls on the streets and engaging in free trade. Due to the difficulty in solving the venue issue, the number of unlicensed vendors continues to increase. Taking the Chaoyang District Shuizhui Market as an example: although it covers an area of 13,000 square meters and has more than a hundred goods sheds, the management is strict, but it still cannot meet the needs of the operators. According to statistics, there are more than 200 to 300 vendors conducting transactions outside the market every day, the vast majority of whom are unlicensed vendors. Among them, shortchanging, price gouging, forced buying and selling, and monopolistic trading are particularly serious. Unlicensed vendors use the tactic of moving from one place to another to engage in guerrilla warfare with commercial management personnel. I believe that while further strengthening the management of street vendor markets in the capital, the venue issue should also be seriously addressed.

Comrade Ma Qingchun's letter reflects the problem of "no market, just trade," which is one of the important reasons affecting market management. Without a fixed stall, even if commercial management personnel exert great effort to conduct temporary rectifications, they can only achieve temporary results but cannot sustain them. Often, after a period of time, everything returns to its original state. Experience has proven that to make market management orderly, it is necessary to improve the basic facilities and ensure that there is both a market and a venue. It is hoped that relevant departments will pay attention to this matter.

　　有市无场        
    不利管理
    本版三月九日刊登的《黑心秤》一文，引起北京市有关部门的重视。最近，北京市各区的工商管理人员对摊商市场进行了检查和整顿，市场秩序有所改善。如何从根本上解决这些问题呢？朝阳区水碓子集贸市场的工商管理所马庆春同志给本报来信，他在来信中说：
    大批外地经商者进入首都，使本来就已经拥挤的场地变得更加拥挤。有市无场，致使众多的经商者走向街头设摊，自由交易。由于场地难以解决，使无照商贩不断增多，仅以朝阳区水碓集贸市场为例：尽管它占地一万三千平方米，拥有上百间货棚，管理是认真的，但仍远远满足不了经营者的需要。据统计每天在市场周围进行场外交易的商贩多达二三百人，绝大部分为无照商贩。他们中间，缺斤少两，哄抬物价，强买强卖，搞霸主交易等违法经营现象尤为严重。无照商贩们采用打一枪换一个地方的游击战术与工商管理人员周旋。我认为首都摊商市场在进一步加强管理的同时，场地也应给予认真解决。
    马庆春同志来信反映“有市无场”的问题，是影响市场管理的重要原因之一。由于没有固定的摊位，即使工商管理人员花大力气突击整顿，可以临时收效，但不能持之以恒。往往隔一段时间后又一切如初。经验证明，要使市场管理有秩，必须健全基础设施，做到有市有场，希望有关部门重视。
