More than half of female children nationwide unenrolled

	People's Representative Huang Qixian calls for attention to women's education

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 26 (Reporters Zhu Shilong, Liu Xiaohang) People's Representative and Vice Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation Huang Qixian called on March 25 for society as a whole to pay attention to the issue of women's education.

	Huang Qixian, speaking in a small group discussion, said that currently, the enrollment rate of women in China is lower than that of men. The enrollment rate of female students in primary schools is only 45.4%. In 1987, there were more than 2.7 million children aged 7 to 11 who were not enrolled in school, of which 83% were girls. Among the more than 200 million illiterate people in the country, 70% are women.

	Huang Qixian pointed out that among dropout students, the proportion of girls is higher than that of boys. According to statistics from relevant departments in Gansu Province, in 1986, 80% of female students could not complete five years of primary school. Especially in rural areas, some parents only allow boys to study while girls drop out of school to engage in labor. The old idea of valuing boys over girls in education is very serious. On the other hand, the employment of female child labor is also very serious in some places. The Guangdong Labor Bureau conducted a survey of 200 factories in five areas including Shenzhen and Luohu, and found that 49 factories employed more than 500 female child workers.

	In response, Huang Qixian suggested strengthening the publicity and education of the Compulsory Education Law to form a strong public opinion, so that the whole society can pay attention to the issue of women's education. It is also necessary to formulate specific implementation rules or regulations based on the Compulsory Education Law to effectively protect women's right to education through legislation.

　　全国半数以上女童未入学        
    人大代表黄启璪呼吁重视女性教育
    新华社北京３月２６日电  （记者朱世龙、刘晓行）全国人大代表、全国妇联副主席黄启璪，２５日呼吁全社会重视女性教育的问题。
    黄启璪代表在小组讨论中说，当前我国女性入学率低于男性，小学女生入学率仅占４５．４％，１９８７年全国有２７０多万７至１１岁的儿童未能入学，其中８３％是女童。全国２亿多文盲人口中，７０％是女性。
    黄启璪代表指出，在辍学儿童中，女童的比例大于男童。据甘肃省有关部门统计，１９８６年，８０％的女生不能读到小学五年级。尤其是农村，一些家长只供男孩读书而让女孩辍学参加劳动。教育上的重男轻女旧观念很严重。另一方面，一些地方雇用女性童工也很严重，广东劳动局曾对深圳、罗湖等五个地区的２００家工厂作调查，发现有４９家工厂雇用的５００多名童工全是女性。
    对此，黄启璪建议，要加强对义务教育法的宣传教育，形成强大的社会舆论，让整个社会来关心女性的教育问题。还应根据义务教育法制定具体的实施细则或条例，切实从立法上保护女性受教育的权利。
