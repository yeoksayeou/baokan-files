Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 13th.

The Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet today released the draft of "General Principles for Reforming the Management of the Economic and Social Sectors of the Union Republics on the Basis of Expanded Autonomy, Self-Governance, and Self-Financing," for public discussion.

The draft notes that autonomy and self-financing should not be limited to the Union Republics but should also include autonomous republics, autonomous regions, and administrative districts. The draft proposes to expand the management authority of the Union Republics and regions, including the production of food and consumer goods, services for residents, regional production infrastructure, construction complexes, environmental protection, and other activities related to the daily lives of residents. However, sectors such as fuel and energy, metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, chemical industry, medicine, microbiology, geological exploration, defense, information technology, and postal services will remain under central management.

Legislation will be formulated based on the results of the public discussion of the draft. All preparatory work related to the transition of the Union Republics to autonomy and self-financing should be completed by 1989-1990.

Expanding the authority of the Union Republics is an important part of the political system reform in the USSR. The release and implementation of this draft will further advance the political system reform in the USSR.

　　苏联最高苏维埃主席团通过新文件草案
    扩大地方经营管理范围
    新华社莫斯科３月１３日电  苏联最高苏维埃主席团今天公布了《在扩大主权、自治和自筹资金的基础上改革加盟共和国经济和社会领域领导的总原则》草案，供全民讨论。
    草案指出，自治和自筹资金不应仅局限于加盟共和国一级，还应包括自治共和国、自治州以及行政地区单位。草案建议扩大加盟共和国及区域的经营管理范围，其中包括食品及消费品生产、居民服务行业、区域的生产基础设施、建筑综合体、自然保护以及其他与居民日常生活有关的活动项目，但燃料动力、冶金、机器制造、化工、医疗、微生物、地质勘探、国防、信息技术以及邮电等部门仍归中央领导。
    将根据全民讨论草案的结果制订相应的法律。所有与加盟共和国转入自治和自筹资金有关的准备工作应在１９８９—１９９０年完成。
    扩大加盟共和国权限是苏联政治体制改革的重要组成部分，该项草案的公布与实施将会使苏联的政治体制改革继续向前推进一步。
