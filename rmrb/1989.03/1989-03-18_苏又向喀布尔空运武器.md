The Soviet Union has recently resumed airlifting weapons to the Kabul regime to help it repel the guerrilla attacks on the eastern city of Jalalabad.

Yuri Vorontsov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, revealed at a press conference on March 15 that the defensive weapons airlifted to the Kabul regime include medium-range Frog missiles.

Vorontsov also repeated the old accusations of the Kabul regime, blaming Pakistan for sending hundreds of soldiers to assist the Afghan guerrillas in attacking Jalalabad. He proposed that the United Nations should host negotiations between Pakistan and the Kabul regime, with the Soviet Union and the United States attending as observers, to ease the current situation.

The spokesperson for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry has repeatedly denied that Pakistan has directly involved its military in armed conflicts within Afghanistan, and has stated that the Soviet accusations are completely fabricated.

　　苏又向喀布尔空运武器
    据新华社北京３月１７日电  苏联最近已恢复向喀布尔政权空运武器，以帮助它在东部城市贾拉拉巴德反击游击队的进攻。
    苏联驻阿富汗大使尤里·沃龙佐夫１５日在记者招待会上透露，苏联空运给喀布尔政权的防卫武器包括中程飞毛腿式导弹。
    沃龙佐夫还重复喀布尔政权的老调，指责巴基斯坦派遣了数百名士兵帮助阿富汗游击队攻打贾拉拉巴德。他提议，由联合国主持巴基斯坦和喀布尔政权举行谈判，苏联和美国作为观察员出席，以缓和目前局势。
    巴基斯坦外交部发言人曾一再否认它有军队直接卷入了阿富汗境内的武装冲突，并称苏联的指责完全是虚构的。
