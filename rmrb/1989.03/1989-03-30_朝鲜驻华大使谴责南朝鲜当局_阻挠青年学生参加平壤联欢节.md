North Korean Ambassador Condemns South Korean Authorities for Hindering Youth Students' Participation in Pyongyang Festival

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 29th (reporter Jiǎn Lǔ Róng): The Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, Chu Changjun, today in Beijing condemned the South Korean authorities for obstructing South Korean youth students from participating in the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students to be held in Pyongyang.

	The ambassador said that the South Korean authorities created artificial obstacles, preventing the scheduled meeting on March 16th at Panmunjom between North and South Korean youth student representatives to discuss participation in the festival from taking place.

	He called on the South Korean authorities to immediately stop their activities that go against the wishes of all the Korean people for autonomy, democracy, and unification, and that aim to permanently split the country. He urged them to open the doors and allow South Korean youth students to participate in the Pyongyang festival.
