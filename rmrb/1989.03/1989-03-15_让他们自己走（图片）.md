At the gates of a primary school in Hangzhou, as soon as the school bell rings, the adults waiting anxiously around the school become alert. Among them are factory workers who have taken the day off, officials who have left work early, and grandparents who have taken on the responsibility of raising their grandchildren...

From carrying them to kindergarten to picking them up from school, when will it end? Let them walk themselves!

    让他们自己走
    在杭州的小学校门口，放学铃响过之后，散在四周早已等得心焦的大人们便顿时瞪直了眼。他们中有正赶上厂休的工人，有提前“跑”出来的机关干部，有肩负养育第三代重任的爷爷奶奶们……
    从抱着上幼儿园到接送读书，何时是头啊！让他们自己走吧！
    图片自左向右：1、再捎一个；2、爷爷推你；3、当心凉着；4、在补课吗？5、饭菜凉了。       叶寒青摄
