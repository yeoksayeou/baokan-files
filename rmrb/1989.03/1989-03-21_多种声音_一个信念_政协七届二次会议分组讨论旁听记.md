Just as we entered the Guoyi Hotel, we heard that last night there was a heated discussion among the members of the China Democratic League. We hurriedly asked what the discussion was about, and a staff member, pointing to the meeting room, smiled and said, “They are about to start again, you can go listen.”

As soon as we entered the meeting room, we heard Zhang Bili, a member, speaking: “Just saying ‘education has made progress in the past 10 years’ is too mild. We must clearly see our achievements.” This was exactly the topic from last night. Some people thought “we should fully elaborate on the achievements”; others said “Chinese education has fallen into a crisis”; some believed “the main reason for insufficient educational funds is the country's financial difficulties”; others thought “the key is to correct the leaders' fundamental understanding”…

It seems that there are indeed many different opinions. The issue is not about who is right or wrong, but that the members' consciousness of expressing their thoughts and raising objections has not weakened.

Shen Yuan, a member, continued to speak. He said, “Although the democratic consultation system is not yet perfect, it has indeed made unprecedented progress over the past year.” Wu Cangping, a member, said, “I feel that past democratic supervision has mostly been ‘after the fact,’ discussing after the documents have been printed, whether you agree or not, they will still implement it. Therefore, what is more important is the consultation system before decision-making.”

The meeting room echoed with various different voices. “Last year was active, and this year continues to be active,” Wu Fuheng, a member, described the atmosphere of the discussion to us.

“What we say is not said in vain, this is the wish of all members,” Kong Lingren, a member, said, “Last year at the CPPCC meeting, I said ‘if you don’t say it, it’s for nothing; if you say it, it’s useless.’ Later, I still said it. Now it seems, it was not completely in vain. Like compressing construction projects and cracking down on unhealthy trends, there have been responses. I summarized it into a three-line poem: ‘If it should be said, it must be said; if not said, it’s for nothing; in the end, say it.’”

　　多种声音　一个信念        
    ——政协七届二次会议分组讨论旁听记
    本报记者  凌志军
    刚走进国谊宾馆，就听说昨天晚上在民盟组委员中发生了一场意见不一的讨论。我们急问讨论了什么，一位工作人员指着会议室笑道：“马上又要说了，你们先去听听吧。”
    我们一到会议室，正碰上张毕来委员在发言：“仅仅说‘１０年来教育虽有进步’太轻描淡写，我们对成绩不能不看清楚”。这正是昨晚的话题。有人认为“应当把成绩讲透”；有人说“中国教育已陷入危机”；有人认为“教育经费不足主要是国家财力困难”；有人说“关键是端正领导者的基本认识”……
    看来，不同的意见确实不少。问题并不在于谁是谁非，而在于委员们表述思想，提出异议的意识并没有减弱。
    沈元委员接着发言。他说：“民主协商制度虽然还不够完善，但这一年来确实有了从未有过的进步。”邬沧萍委员说：“我觉得过去的民主监督大都是‘马后炮’，文件打印好了再来讨论，你同意不同意人家照样执行，所以，更要紧的是决策前的协商制度。”
    会议室里响彻着多种不同的声音。“去年活跃，今年继续活跃。”吴富恒委员对我们这样描述讨论的气氛。
    “说了不白说，是所有委员的心愿”，孔令仁委员说，“去年政协会，我说‘不说白不说，说了也没用。’后来还是说了。现在看来，没有完全白说，像压缩基建，抓不正之风，都有了反应。我总结了一个三句半：‘该说就得说，不说白不说，到底说不说，说。’”
