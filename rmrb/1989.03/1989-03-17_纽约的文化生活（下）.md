The cultural life of New York, apart from theater, is also rich in museums. How many large and small museums are there in New York? The number might astonish you: there are a total of 115. Therefore, if you spend a year in New York, visiting two museums each week, by the end of the year, you still won't have seen all the museums.

Among these museums, the largest and most famous is the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is a comprehensive museum with a wide variety of exhibits. Almost every exhibition hall frequently changes its content, featuring Egyptian temples, British furniture, European paintings, Qing Dynasty Chinese clothing, and more.

Purely artistic museums include the Museum of Modern Art (with an attached art cinema) and the Guggenheim Museum, among others. Historical museums include the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration, the National Museum of the American Indian, and the American Museum of Natural History. The Museum of the City of New York, the New York Public Library, and the Brooklyn Museum are larger comprehensive museums, while smaller specialized museums are countless, such as the Cloisters Museum (a 12th-century building reconstructed from bricks and stones transported from France and Spain), the Money Museum, and the Toy Museum, among others.

As for art galleries, they are innumerable, mainly concentrated around the intersection of Madison Avenue and 57th Street, and near Broadway Street in SoHo. The world-famous auction house Sotheby's is located at the intersection of Madison Avenue and 79th Street, and its attached gallery is also open to the public.

Rich and varied concerts and ballet performances are another vibrant feature of New York's cultural life. Lincoln Center, near Columbus Circle, is a brand-new artistic sanctuary built in the 1960s after the demolition of dilapidated buildings, costing $185 million. Here, the Metropolitan Opera House, which can seat 4,000 people, not only performs operas but also ballet, all by world-renowned troupes. Next to it is the New York State Theater, the base of the famous New York City Ballet, which sometimes also hosts performances by other dance troupes. As for concert halls, they are named Avery Fisher Hall and Alice Tully Hall. The New York Philharmonic often performs here. In 1979, during Lincoln Center's 20th anniversary, 31,000 performances were held, attracting 52 million spectators. Nearby is the Juilliard School, where many outstanding musical talents have been nurtured.

New York's musical life, as described in the lyrics of composer James Blake, "spreads throughout the city." For example, Carnegie Hall at the intersection of 7th Avenue and 57th Street, where performing there has always been the ultimate goal for all musicians. The Brooklyn Academy of Music in the Brooklyn area also has a renowned large concert hall, frequently hosting performances by famous symphony orchestras and opera and ballet troupes from home and abroad. Even many churches often hold high-quality musical concerts, not limited to religious music.

Lastly, there is the Radio City Music Hall near Rockefeller Center that must be mentioned. This is perhaps the largest theater in the world, frequently staging large-scale musicals, and sometimes screening blockbuster films, such as the British film "Gandhi."

Of course, behind this brilliant facade, there is also a dark side. For example, Broadway from Times Square to 42nd Street is an area where various low-class bars and pornographic cinemas are concentrated, and it is also a characteristic of New York's nightlife. If considered as part of New York's cultural life, it is somewhat a blemish.

　　纽约的文化生活（下）

    形形色色的博物馆
    纽约的文化生活除了戏剧，接下来就是博物馆。纽约究竟有多少大大小小的博物馆，说出来也许使人咋舌：一共有１１５个。因此你若上纽约逗留一年，每周参观两个博物馆，一年到头的时候，博物馆还没有参观完。
    这些博物馆中最大和最著名的当然是纽约大都会博物馆，这是个综合性的博物馆，展品种类繁多，几乎每一展厅都经常变换展览内容，有埃及的古庙、英国的家具、欧洲的绘画、中国的清代服装……
    纯粹艺术性的博物馆有现代艺术博物馆（附设艺术电影院）、古根纳姆博物馆等；历史性的博物馆有自由女神像下的美国移民博物馆、美国印第安人博物馆、自然历史博物馆等；纽约市博物馆、纽约公共图书馆博物馆，布鲁克林博物馆是较大的综合性博物馆，而较小的专业性博物馆则数不胜数，有修道院博物馆（一砖一瓦由法国和西班牙运来，然后重建的１２世纪建筑）、钱币博物馆、玩偶玩具博物馆等等。
    至于画廊更是不计其数，主要集中在麦迪逊大道与第５７号街交口处附近和苏荷区的百老汇街附近。世界著名的艺术品拍卖行苏索比开设在麦迪逊大街和第７９号街口，它附设的画廊也对外开放。
    　　　　丰富多彩的音乐会
    丰富多采的音乐会与芭蕾舞演出是纽约文化生活的又一绚烂特点。哥伦布圆场附近的林肯中心是６０年代拆迁破败建筑后兴建的一个崭新艺术圣地，耗资１．８５亿美元。这里有可以容纳４０００观众的大都会歌剧院，除了演出歌剧，也演出芭蕾舞，都是世界著名的剧团；挨着的是纽约州剧院，这里是著名的纽约市芭蕾舞团的基地，有时也有其他舞团演出；至于音乐会的演出厅名叫阿佛里·费希厅和爱丽斯·杜莱厅，纽约爱乐乐团经常在这里演出。１９７９年林肯中心２０周年时，曾举行了各种演出３１０００场，观众达５２００万。中心附近还有一个朱丽亚特音乐学院，许多杰出的音乐天才都是从这里培养出来的。
    纽约的音乐生活如作曲家詹姆斯·布莱克的歌词所说：“遍及全市各地。”比如在第七号大道和第５７号街口上的卡内基大厅，在那里演奏一向就是所有音乐家一心向往的事业成就的最高目标。位于布鲁克林区的布鲁克林音乐学院也有一个声誉昭著的大音乐厅经常有国内外著名交响乐队和歌剧、舞剧团的演出。甚至许多教堂也经常有高质量的音乐演奏会，内容也不仅仅限于宗教音乐。
    最后还有一个座落在洛克菲勒中心附近的无线电音乐厅也必须一提，这恐怕是全世界最大的剧场，经常演出场面浩大的音乐剧，有时也放映特别卖座的电影，如英国片《甘地》。
    当然，在这灿烂一面的背后，也有阴暗的一面。比如百老汇大道从时报广场到第４２号街一带是各种下等酒馆、色情影院集中的地方，也是纽约夜生活的一个特色，如果作为纽约文化生活的一部分未免美中不足。
