Title: What Do We Lack the Most?

What do we lack the most? This was the question posed by Jiangxi delegate Shu Shengyou. Is it money? Is it grain? Or is it coal? All of these are in short supply. But Shu Shengyou believes there is something even more lacking: "what we lack most is people's initiative."

Many delegates share this view. Over the past two days, the reporter listened to discussions in four provincial and municipal delegates' groups. Everyone is pondering how to address China's current situation.

"The way out lies in mobilizing the enthusiasm of hundreds of millions of people," said Jiangsu delegate Wu Rong.

What is the current situation? "Many people are like chess pieces on a board, moved one step at a time, sometimes they can't be moved at all," said Fujian delegate Zhang Mingjun. "Many people are thinking about what benefits them. Everyone fights for what benefits them, and no one cares about what doesn't. Is it any wonder that reform is so difficult?"

It's easy to get by, but hard to achieve something. I met a farmer delegate from Shandong, Sun Libin, who retired from a state-owned factory and returned to his village. In a few years, he transformed the village from begging for a living to becoming the richest in the area, though he himself only gained a head of white hair. He sighed, "It's really hard to do something in China, hard enough to turn my hair white in three years." This made me think, if a cause makes those who contribute to it suffer, while those who exploit and betray it enjoy, how can this cause be successful?

There was a person who once contributed to the country's scientific research and was considered a talent among his peers. However, he is now an agent for a foreign company in China, trying every means to sell outdated foreign goods to China. He has gradually succeeded, while his former Chinese colleagues find it difficult to accomplish anything.

"Our society lacks a mechanism to unite people's hearts," said Fujian delegate Zhang Mingjun. "If you do well, 'fools' and 'lazybones' share the credit, and even 'troublemakers' get a share. If you make a mistake, you get a hundred lashes, not one less. If you are an excellent factory director, you won't get an extra penny. If you are an ordinary factory director, you can still get a state subsidy. Loss-making enterprises still give bonuses. If this situation doesn't change, how can people's hearts be motivated to progress?"

"Difficulties are great, but potential is also great," said Jilin Governor and delegate Wang Zhongyu. Once, savings in Jilin Province dropped sharply, and funds were tight. During the March 8th Women's Day celebration, Wang Zhongyu honestly told the women of the province about the difficulties. These "family financial managers" rushed to deposit money in the bank. Reflecting on this, he said deeply, "The people truly care about our cause. The question is how our cadres can unite everyone's enthusiasm."

Another delegate, Anhui Province Chu County Region Commissioner Zhang Youdao, had a similar experience. Chu County is the birthplace of the "Household Responsibility System." Since then, grain production has increased year by year, with 1988's production being one-third higher than 1984's, bringing hope to the agricultural front, which has not been very prosperous in recent years. Talking about the reasons, Zhang Youdao had a deep understanding: "The key is to mobilize the enthusiasm of the farmers. Without this, agriculture cannot improve."

Jiangxi delegate Shu Shengyou said, "What we need most today is unity, the unity of hundreds of millions of people."

　　我们最缺什么？        
    ——七届人大二次会议分组讨论会侧记
    本报记者  凌志军
    “我们现在最缺什么？”江西代表舒圣佑问道。是钱？是粮？还是煤？都缺。但舒圣佑认为还有更缺的，那就是“缺人的积极性”。
    有这种看法的代表很多。记者近两天旁听四个省市代表团的讨论，大家面对中国当前的局势都在思考着“怎么办”。
    “出路就在于调动起亿万人的积极性”，江苏代表吴熔说。
    现在的状况又怎样呢？“许多人像棋盘上的棋子，拨一下，走一步，有时拨不动。”福建代表张明俊说，“许多人在想怎样对自己有利。有利的事人人争，无利的事无人管，改革还有不难的？”
    混事易，干事难。我遇到一位来自山东的农民代表孙立斌，他从国营厂退职回归乡里，几年奋斗使村庄摆脱了要饭的历史，成为当地首富，而他自己只是多了一头白发。他叹道：“在中国干点事真难呀，难得我三年间就白了头。”这使我想到，假如一个事业要让为它出力，献身的人苦恼，而让吃它、背离它的人快乐，这事业还有不难的吗？
    有一个人曾为国家的科研作过贡献，可算是同龄中的一个人才。可是，他现在成了一家外国公司在中国的代理商，正在千方百计地把外国的过时货推销到中国来。他逐步取得了成功，而他过去的那些中国同事却是想干点事就是干不成。
    “我们的社会还缺少一种凝聚人心的机制。”福建代表张明俊说，“你干好了，‘笨蛋’、‘懒蛋’跟着有份，连‘捣蛋’也有份。你干错了，一百大板全打在你身上，一板也不少。你是一个优秀厂长，不会多给你一份钱。你是一个平庸厂长，还可以吃一份国家补贴。亏损企业还在发奖金，这状况不改变，人心何能思进？”
    “困难很大，潜力也很大。”吉林省长、人大代表王忠禹说。吉林省银行储蓄一度下降得很厉害，资金也紧，今年“三·八”妇女节的庆祝会上，王忠禹把困难老老实实告诉全省的妇女，这些“家庭财政部长”们纷纷把钱存进银行。谈起这事，他深有感触：“人民真正关心着我们的事业，问题是我们干部用什么把大家的积极性凝聚在一起。”
    另一位代表、安徽省滁县地区专员张友道也有同样的感受。滁县是“大包干”的发源地。从那以后，粮食总产年年递增，一九八八年比一九八四年增长三分之一，这给近年不大景气的农业战线带来一种希望。谈到原因，张友道深有体会地说：“关键是调动农民的积极性。离开这个，农业好不了。”
    江西代表舒圣佑说，“我们今天最需要的是人心，是亿万人民的众志成城之心。”
