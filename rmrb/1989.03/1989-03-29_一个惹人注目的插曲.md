A Notable Interlude

The West German Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement on March 25, denying the news from Brussels that NATO had reached a consensus on the modernization of short-range missiles. He pointed out that this news has no basis. This incident reflects that the United States and West Germany not only have differing opinions on the modernization of short-range missiles but also have disagreements on Soviet policy and the assessment of the European situation.

After the United States and the Soviet Union reached an agreement on intermediate-range missiles and implemented it, the United States believes that the threat from the Soviet Union to Western Europe still exists. It advocates the modernization of short-range missiles to maintain nuclear deterrence against the Soviet Union and to strengthen the NATO alliance, preventing Western Europe from showing centrifugal tendencies in the face of the Soviet Union's détente offensive. However, West Germany has raised objections, believing that the modernization of short-range missiles in Western Europe is not necessary before 1992. The disagreement between West Germany and the United States on this issue has persisted for some time. Now, U.S. President Bush is reviewing U.S. foreign policy with his senior security advisors, focusing on U.S.-Soviet relations, arms control negotiations, defense policy, and future requirements for conventional and nuclear forces. West Germany's stance on these issues is significant for the United States in formulating new policies. At this time, the news from Brussels that a consensus has been reached on the modernization of short-range missiles seems not to be coincidental.

Why does West Germany insist on its stance? An article in the Washington Post on March 18 provides some insight. The article states, "While the Bush administration is still arranging its foreign policy agenda, Chancellor Kohl's government is vigorously pursuing an Eastern European strategy." Clearly, West Germany has its own Eastern strategy. In recent months, West Germany has been actively providing loans to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to support their reform processes and strengthen bilateral relations. West Germany has its own intentions for doing so.

However, the West is concerned that even if West Germany's strategy succeeds, it may not be beneficial to the West. They fear that West Germany might "become infatuated with its potential role in Central Europe" and "one day break away from the Western alliance to play a leading role in a neutral Central European bloc." A prominent American figure even suggested that measures must be taken to prevent the re-emergence of a German empire that dominates Central Europe. Obviously, if events develop in this direction, U.S. defense and foreign policies will have to undergo significant changes. The reason for the U.S.'s eagerness to understand West Germany's intentions on the modernization of short-range missiles seems to be here.

The words of the Soviet ambassador to Bonn, Kvyatinsky, quoted in the Washington Post article are worth noting. Kvyatinsky said that the Soviet Union does not want West Germany to withdraw from the NATO alliance, lest it provoke a similar reaction in the Warsaw Pact. The two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, seem to not want Europe to fall into turmoil. In their view, the military confrontation between the NATO and Warsaw Pact alliances has eased, but they are still unwilling to take the step of completely breaking the status quo.

However, with the easing of the international situation, it is impossible for international politics and international relations to stand still. In the coming period, the two major blocs in Europe will have a process of adjustment and coordination in their policies and international relations. In this process, it will be difficult for the United States and its allies to maintain the same level of consensus on all issues as in the past. This undoubtedly adds to the difficulty for the Bush administration in reviewing its foreign policy.

　　一个惹人注目的插曲
    西德外交部发言人３月２５日发表声明，否认布鲁塞尔所传北约已就欧洲短导现代化问题达成一致意见的消息，指出这一消息没有任何根据。这一插曲反映出：美国同西德不仅在短导现代化上仍然意见不一，而且在对苏政策和对欧洲局势的估计上存在分歧。
    美苏在中导问题上达成协议并付诸实施以后，美国认为苏联对西欧的威胁依然存在，主张实现短导的现代化，以保持对苏联的核威慑，并借以巩固北约集团，防止西欧在苏联的缓和攻势面前出现离心倾向。但是西德却对此提出了异议，认为在１９９２年以前西欧的短导现代化不必提上日程。西德与美国在这个问题上顶牛已经持续了相当一段时期。现在美国总统布什正在同他的高级安全顾问们全面审查美国对外政策，其中美苏关系、武器控制谈判、防务政策、未来对常规力量和核力量的要求，是需要研究的重要部分。西德的态度如何，对美国在这些方面制订新的政策意义重大。在这个时候从布鲁塞尔传出短导现代化问题上已达成一致意见的消息，似非偶然。
    西德为什么坚持自己的意见，美国《华盛顿邮报》３月１８日的一篇报道颇能说明问题。这篇报道说，“正当布什政府还在安排它的对外政策的日程之际，科尔总理的政府却在全力推行一项东欧集团战略。”显然，西德有自己的东方战略。为了实施这一战略，近几个月来西德对向苏联东欧提供贷款支持它们的改革进程和密切双方关系方面干得较为起劲。西德这样做有它的意图。
    可是西方担心西德的战略即使取得成功，对西方也未必有利。他们怕西德“迷恋于它今后有可能在中欧发挥作用”，“将来总有一天会脱离西方联盟，在一个中立的中欧集团中扮演先锋角色”。美国一位知名人士甚至提出必须防止叱咤中欧风云的德意志帝国的再现。显然，如果事情向这个方向发展，美国的防务政策和对外政策就要发生很大的转折。美国急于探明西德在短导现代化问题上的意图，原因看来就在这里。
    《华盛顿邮报》的报道所引苏联驻波恩大使克维钦斯的话值得注意。克维钦斯说，苏联不希望西德退出北约集团，以免在华约集团引起同样的反应。美苏两个超级大国现在看来都不希望欧洲出现动乱。在它们看来，北约集团和华约集团的军事对抗气氛缓和了，但是它们都还不愿意走到彻底打破现状的地步。
    不过，随着国际形势的缓和，国际政治和国际关系要站在原地踏步是不可能的。在今后相当一段时间内，欧洲东西两大集团内部在政策和国际关系上将有一个调整、协调的过程。在这一过程中，美国及其盟国要想在一切问题上像过去那样保持一致，看来是不大可能了。它无疑给布什政府审查对外政策增加了难度。
