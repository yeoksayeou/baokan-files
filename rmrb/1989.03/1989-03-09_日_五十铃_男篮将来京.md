The Japanese "Isuzu" men's basketball team, which recently won the Japanese National Basketball League championship, will arrive in Beijing on March 11th. That evening, they will play their first match against the Chinese men's basketball powerhouse, the Beijing Steel and Iron (Capital Iron and Steel) team.

The "Isuzu" team includes several players who have been selected for the Japanese national team, as well as two European-American players standing at 2.05 meters tall. The team's coach has stated that during their previous visits to China, they were defeated by the Beijing team and this time they aim to "redeem themselves."

The Beijing men's and women's basketball teams recently officially changed their affiliation to become the Beijing Steel and Iron (Capital Iron and Steel) team. This match will be their first international appearance since becoming a corporate team.

　　日“五十铃”男篮将来京
    本报讯  刚刚夺得日本全国篮球联赛冠军的“五十铃”男篮，将于三月十一日飞抵北京，当晚与我国男篮劲旅首钢队（北京队）进行首场比赛。
    “五十铃”队中有数人曾入选日本国家队，还拥有两名身高二点零五米的欧美球员。这个队的教练表示，前几年他们访华时曾负于北京队，此行要力争“雪耻”。
    北京男女篮球队前不久正式改换门庭为首钢队，这次比赛将是他们成为企业队后首次在国际赛事中亮相。
