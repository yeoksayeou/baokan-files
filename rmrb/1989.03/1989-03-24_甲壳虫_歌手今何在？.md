	Twenty-five years ago, four British singers in their early twenties flew to New York. The members of the band known as the Beatles were Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr.

	These four young men with bangs and dressed in Edwardian clothing sparked a social trend, changed American popular music, and enriched the American vocabulary. Their hairstyles and clothing changed the appearance of Western youth. Their influence was so widespread that it could even be seen in some Chinese youths.

	The Beatles' music has a strong rhythm, based on black blues rock. The singers infused their melodies with feelings of worry, fear, and excitement, which resonated with the emotions of American youth at the time.

	The band was formed in 1956 and performed for the first time under the name Beatles in a club in Liverpool in 1960. Their hit songs include "Please Love Me" and "Please Give Me Happiness." After 1966, the band stopped performing publicly. The album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," recorded in 1967, sold nearly 3 million copies in the first three months of its release. The film they starred in, "A Hard Day's Night," grossed $1.6 million in its first week. After recording "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," the band's manager, Brian Epstein, passed away, and the band lost its core. By the end of 1970, the band had disbanded. Now, among the four, Lennon has died prematurely. He was shot and killed by a fan outside his New York residence on December 8, 1980.

	Harrison now lives with his second wife, Olivia, and their 9-year-old son, Dhani, in a Gothic-style mansion in a city in western Britain. He has been off the stage for nearly 20 years. In July 1987, he held his first solo concert in 15 years at the Wembley Stadium and recorded "When We Was Fab," which topped the best-selling album list in the United States in 1988. He is now the head of an independent film studio in Britain.

	Starr now lives in a secluded villa in southern Britain. He is the first member of the band to become a grandfather.

	Paul is currently recording an album, which is scheduled to be released this year. His spokesperson said he is considering how to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the band's rise to fame this year.

　　“甲壳虫”歌手今何在？
    曹玉如
    ２５年前，４名２０岁刚出头的英国歌手乘飞机来到纽约。这个名为“甲壳虫”乐队的成员是保罗·麦卡特尼、约翰·列农、乔治·哈里森和里戈·斯塔尔。
    就是这４位刘海盈额、身着爱德华七世的服装的青年，掀起了一股社会风潮，改变了美国的通俗音乐，丰富了美国人的语汇。他们的发式和衣着，改变了西方青年的风貌。其影响之广甚至在一些中国青年的身上也能看到他们的影子。
    甲壳虫音乐节奏感极强，以黑人布鲁斯摇滚乐为基础。歌手们把忧虑、惊恐和兴奋的情绪融入旋律，与当时美国青年的情绪一拍即和。
    这个乐队于１９５６年组成，１９６０年在利物浦俱乐部首次以甲壳虫队为名进行演出，成名作品有《请爱我》、《请给我快乐》等。１９６６年后乐队停止公开演出。１９６７年录制的唱片《胡椒中士》在发行的头３个月里就出售了近３００万张。他们参加摄制的影片《忙乱了一天后的夜晚》第一周就创下１６０万美元票房收入。在录制了《胡椒中士》之后不久，乐队经纪人布赖恩·爱泼斯坦去世，乐队失去核心。１９７０年底乐队瓦解。现在这４个人中，列农已过早夭折，他是１９８０年１２月８日在纽约住所外被一名崇拜者开枪打死的。
    哈里森现同第二个妻子奥立维尔及９岁的儿子达里住在英国西部某市一座哥特式大厦里。他离开舞台近２０年，１９８７年７月在威姆布莱剧场举行了１５年来的首场个人音乐独唱会，并录制了《让你记住我》，该唱片在美国１９８８年畅销唱片名单中居于榜首。他现在担任英国一家独立制片厂的负责人。
    斯塔尔现在住在英国南部某地一座与世隔绝的别墅里。他是该乐队里第一位当上祖父的人。
    保罗正在录制一个唱片集，唱片集将于年内发行。他的发言人说，他正在考虑今年如何纪念乐队成名２５周年。
