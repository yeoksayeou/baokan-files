The affected cotton farmers' lives have been properly arranged. The Jintan fake pesticide incident has been resolved.

Our reporter, Gong Yongquan, reports from Nanjing on March 2: Jiangsu and Hebei provinces have recently reached an agreement to properly handle the Jintan fake pesticide incident.

Both provinces believe that the Jintan fake pesticide incident must be handled according to the law, and the legal and economic responsibilities should be borne by the responsible enterprises and individuals in Jintan County that have legal person status. Considering that economic disputes seeking compensation through legal means cannot solve the actual difficulties faced by the affected cotton farmers, through government-level consultations, based on the principles of "acting according to the law, facing reality, joint consultation, and proper handling," both sides have agreed: the judicial departments of both provinces will cooperate to expedite the case closure. To solve the actual difficulties of the cotton farmers, Jiangsu will raise 2.7 million yuan as a one-time subsidy to help the Hebei provincial government arrange the lives of the affected cotton farmers. Hebei Province also expressed that it will raise a certain amount of funds to arrange the lives of the cotton farmers and will be responsible for doing a good job in the work related to the cotton farmers. Thus, the Jintan fake pesticide incident has been resolved.

    受害棉农生活已妥善安排
    金坛假农药事件了结
    本报南京三月二日电　记者龚永泉报道：江苏、河北两省日前达成协议，妥善处理金坛假农药事件。
  两省认为，金坛假农药事件必须依法处理，法律和经济责任应由该县有法人资格的责任企业和责任人承担。考虑到经济纠纷的赔偿诉诸法律，难以解决受害棉农的实际困难，通过政府间的协商，根据“依法办事、面对现实、共同协商、妥善处理”的原则，双方商谈确定：两省司法部门配合抓紧工作，尽快结案。为解决棉农的实际困难，江苏筹款二百七十万元，作为一次性补助经费，帮助河北省政府安排好困难棉农生活。河北省表示也要筹措一定经费安排棉农生活，并负责做好棉农的工作。至此，金坛假农药事件了结。
