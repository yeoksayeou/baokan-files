Title: A Pity for a Box

A friend came to visit and brought two boxes of pastries for the elderly. The packaging was exquisite and luxurious, with gold lettering on the cover, making it an excellent gift for friends and family. However, upon opening it the next day, I was greatly disappointed: the pastries inside were not as good as those sold loose in the market, and two pieces were even slightly moldy. It is said that just the packaging box alone costs one yuan, what a pity for the box.

It is well known that our country's packaging is backward. Often, a first-class product comes with second or third-class packaging. With the opening up to the outside world and the development of a commodity economy, packaging is increasingly attracting people's attention, which is undoubtedly a good thing. However, in recent years, some manufacturers, in order to expand sales, have not focused on improving product quality but have instead put effort into packaging to raise prices and attract customers. This is putting the cart before the horse. Packaging undoubtedly plays a certain role in the circulation of commodities. But it can only effectively play its role on the premise that the commodity itself is genuine and of good quality. If this point is ignored, it may bring short-term benefits, but ultimately, it will lose customers.

　　可惜了一个盒子
    朱国坤
    有朋友来家中，给老人带了两盒糕点，其包装精美、华丽，金字封面，不失为馈赠亲友的佳品。谁知第二天打开一看，大失所望：里面点心不如市面散卖的，有两块还有点发霉。据说光这个包装盒就要一元钱，真可惜了一个盒子。
    我国的包装落后，是众所周知的。常常是一等产品，二、三等包装。随着对外开放，商品经济的发展，商品包装越来越引起人们的重视，这无疑是件好事。但是，近年来一些生产厂家，为了扩大销售，不在产品质量上下功夫，光在包装上动脑筋，以此提高价格，招揽顾客，这就本末倒置了。商品包装无疑在商品流通中起一定作用。但它只有在商品本身货真价实的前提下，才能更有效地发挥作用。如果忽略这一点，可能一时受益，但最终要失去用户的。
