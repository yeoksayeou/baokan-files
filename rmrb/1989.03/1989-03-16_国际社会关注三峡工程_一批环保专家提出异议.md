The World Wildlife Fund today advised the Chinese government not to proceed with the construction of the Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze River without fully considering the ecological and environmental factors.

A group of experts attending the fund's annual meeting in Beijing today expressed their concerns to the capital's media.

This international organization, which has long cooperated with Chinese government departments and research institutions, has been dedicated to the protection of giant pandas, tropical rainforests, rivers, lakes, marshes, and other biological resources. The organization is deeply concerned about the proposed Three Gorges Project. Dr. Kramer, the director of the environmental protection department of the fund, and other experts such as Mr. Rong Si, the Chinese project consultant, cited numerous foreign examples to illustrate that building large dams on rivers without first adequately addressing ecological and environmental issues can have irreversible and serious consequences. The experts believe that the construction of the Three Gorges Dam will inevitably lead to siltation in the reservoir, significant changes in the riverbed water level, and the extinction of numerous fish and bird species over thousands of kilometers downstream.

The experts analyzed that one of the main objectives of the Three Gorges Project is to prevent floods, but the root cause of floods is the destruction of forest vegetation. Relying on dams to control floods is akin to "Western medicine treating symptoms"; whereas strengthening environmental protection and afforestation in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River is the "Chinese medicine treating the root cause." They suggested that China should adopt the "Chinese medical approach" to manage the Yangtze River.

　　国际社会关注三峡工程  一批环保专家提出异议
    本报北京３月１５日讯  记者杨良化报道：世界野生生物基金会今天奉劝中国政府，不要在没有充分考虑生态环境因素的情况下，贸然动工兴建长江三峡工程。
    正在北京出席该基金会年会的一批专家，今天向首都新闻界表示了他们的关注与担忧。
    这个多年来与中国政府部门及科研机构合作，致力于开展大熊猫、热带雨林、河湖沼泽及其它生物保护的国际组织，对拟议中的三峡工程极表担忧。基金会环保部主任克莱默博士、中国项目顾问容思等专家引述国外许多实例说明，不预先充分考虑解决好生态环境问题，在江河上修建大型水坝将会带来不可挽回的严重影响。专家们认为，三峡大坝一旦兴建，必然造成库区泥沙淤积，河床水位大变，下游几千公里不少鱼类、鸟类灭绝的恶果。
    专家们分析说，三峡工程的主要任务之一是防止水灾，而水灾的根本原因是森林植被的破坏。靠修大坝防洪，好比是“西医治表”；而加强长江上中游环境保护和绿化，才是“中医治本”。他们建议中国治理长江采用“中医疗法”。
