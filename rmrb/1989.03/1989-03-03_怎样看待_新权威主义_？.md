	How to View "New Authoritarianism"

	How to view new authoritarianism has been discussed in some newspapers, with differing opinions. Below are four articles for your reading and reference. — Editor

	Wú Jiāxiáng: A new authority is needed to eliminate the power vacuum caused by the decline of old authority, ensuring social stability for the development of freedom.

	Before democracy and freedom "get married," there is a period of "flirtation" between authoritarianism and freedom. If democracy is the lifelong partner of freedom, then authoritarianism is freedom's "lover" before marriage.

	Can't democracy guarantee individual freedom? This depends on the stage of social development. If the question is asked of a mature modernized society, the answer is yes. But for a transitional society where individual freedom has not yet fully developed, it is not democracy that nurtures freedom, but freedom that bears the fruit of democracy. In my view, social development roughly goes through three stages: the traditional authoritarian stage, the stage of developing individual freedom under new authoritarianism, and the stage of combining freedom with democracy. Why can't we skip from the traditional authoritarian stage directly to the stage of freedom and democracy? This is because the decline of old authority inevitably involves a process of decentralizing highly concentrated power, but this power does not completely fall into the hands of the common people. Instead, it is intercepted by the intermediate social structure created by the old authority. This intermediate retention of power puts the society in a state lacking both authority and freedom, with neither necessary centralization nor necessary democracy, but only dispersion. Dispersionism devours both centralization and democracy. Measures to develop democratic freedom become measures to expand dispersion; measures to strengthen centralization become measures to further reduce individual freedom. A new authority is needed to eliminate the old social structure caused by the old authority, making the intermediate inflated power shift to both ends: on the one hand, developing individual freedom, and on the other hand, using necessary centralization to remove obstacles and maintain social stability in the development of freedom.

	Zhōu Wénzhāng: New authoritarianism is an impractical "panacea."

	New authoritarianism is an impractical "panacea." Its main mistakes are: first, China does not have the problem of losing authority and rebuilding it; the key is how to scientifically use these powers; second, it one-sidedly regards centralization as a panacea, ignoring a crucial core issue, namely: what should the "new authority" of centralized politics rely on to establish itself and how should it be maintained? Vaguely calling for "strongman politics" and "centralized politics" is equivalent to pushing social politics and economy back to the tracks before the reform, causing the reform to retreat comprehensively. Lacking specific analysis and copying the experiences and models of other countries and regions (the four little dragons) is the third mistake of new authoritarianism.

	Yú Hàochéng: The essence of the new authoritarianism theory is still advocating rule by sage kings and wise ministers.

	The "new authoritarianism" trend believes that China's modernization does not need to promote democratization, and what is especially needed now is to establish centralized authority, with a strong-willed and iron-fisted leader to lead us to achieve modernization. They particularly cite the example of the Asian four little dragons, saying that South Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong are basically authoritarian regimes, with no democratization, yet their economies have developed rapidly.

	This reasoning is utterly far-fetched. Because the Asian four little dragons are all free economies, and they are export-oriented economies, strongly constrained by the international market. The role of their national or regional governments in managing the economy is minimal. How can this be compared with a country like China, which is mainly a product economy and where the economy is strictly and strongly controlled by politics?

	Advocates of new authoritarianism say that in modern European history, there was a so-called "honeymoon period of authoritarianism and freedom." However, it should be noted that Europe was a feudal manor system, and since the Middle Ages, Europe had been divided into many small feudal states. At the beginning of the bourgeois democratic revolution in Europe, the rising bourgeoisie had to support the emperor or king to implement national unification, in order to break down the feudal barriers of the small states and create conditions for the development of commodity economy.

	However, the situation in China is quite different. The feudal system in China's history was not of the manor type. Since Qin Shihuang unified the Six States, China has been a centralized feudalist country. From the Empress Dowager Cixi to Yuan Shikai and later, all these rulers were authoritarian monarchs who did not allow any freedom to develop commodity economy, let alone talk about any "honeymoon period of authoritarianism and freedom." To develop commodity economy, a democratic political system must be established. To make the economic system reform successful, political system reform must be carried out in conjunction with or even ahead of it. This has been proven by the historical experience of China and other countries. Although the advocates of new authoritarianism claim that their theory is a new one, in fact, it is still the outdated idea of advocating rule by sage kings and wise ministers, reflecting the thoughts and demands of peasant small producers.

	Xiāo Gōngqín: New authoritarianism has a certain reference and enlightening value for China's choice of modernization model.

	Not all authoritarian politics can be called new authoritarianism. As a political practice, new authoritarianism must meet the following conditions, or characteristics.

	Firstly, the rulers of new authoritarianism must have a certain modernized orientation in economics. The goals they set for governing and developing the country should be consistent with the mainstream of world economic development—marketization. Therefore, new authoritarianism highly emphasizes economic development, popular education, and other goals to gain the support of the vast majority of the people.

	Secondly, new authoritarianism relies on a large and effective bureaucratic system and a strong military force to implement top-down rule. Therefore, new authoritarianism has an iron-fisted political style. Sometimes, military-political strongmen, in order to achieve political stability, even resort to high-pressure methods to suppress political opposition. In terms of ideology, new authoritarianism has more identification with the traditional value system, believing that the traditional value system is the foundation for the cohesion of national spirit.

	Finally, and most importantly, new authoritarianism with a modernized orientation adopts an open policy towards Western capital, advanced technology, and culture, hoping to promote the development of capitalism in their own country through this. The result of this policy is the gradual formation of a middle-class stratum with considerable economic, cultural, and political power within the country.

	New authoritarianism has two sides: it may smoothly transition to a democratic system, or it may regress to a more conservative and backward traditionalism. For third-world countries, new authoritarianism is a disaster, but it is a "necessary disaster" that has to be accepted.

	Whether in theory or in reality, China does not have the background and conditions for implementing the political form of new authoritarianism in third-world countries. However, as a political theory, new authoritarianism undoubtedly has a certain reference and enlightening value for the choice of modernization models for third-world countries, including China. This is the significance of our study and discussion of it today.

### 怎样看待“新权威主义”？

    怎样看待“新权威主义”？
    如何看待新权威主义，一些报刊已经载文讨论，仁者见仁，智者见智，各抒己见。摘登4篇于下，供阅读和参考。　——编者
    吴稼祥：必须有新的权威来消除旧权威衰落造成的权力中间截留，保持自由发展的社会稳定。
    在民主与自由“结婚”之前，有一段专制与自由的“调情”期。如果说民主是自由的终身伴侣，则专制是自由的婚前“情人”。
    难道不能用民主来保障个人自由吗？这要看向什么阶段的社会发问。如果是向一个成熟的现代化社会发问，答案是肯定的。但对于一个个人自由尚未充分发育的转型社会来说，不是民主养育了自由，而是自由之花结出了民主之果。在我的概念中，社会发展大约经历这样三个阶段，即传统的专制权威阶段，新权威主义保护下的个人自由发展阶段以及自由与民主结合的阶段。为什么不能从传统权威阶段一步跨入自由民主阶段？这是因为伴随着旧权威的衰落，必然有一个曾经高度集中的权力的下落过程，但权力没有完全或完全没有落到作为个人的平民手里，而是被旧权威造成的中间社会结构层层截留了。权力的这种中间滞留使社会进入一种既缺乏权威又缺乏自由的状态，既没有必要的集中，也没有必要的民主，有的只是分散。分散主义既吞食集中，也吞食民主。发展民主自由的措施，会变成扩大分散的措施；加强集中的措施，则变成进一步削减个人自由的措施。必须有新的权威来消除旧权威造成的旧社会结构，使中间膨胀的权力向两端变迁：一方面使个人自由得到发展，另一方面利用必要的中央集权排除障碍，保持自由发展中的社会稳定。

    周文彰：新权威主义是一张不切实际的“救世良方”。
    新权威主义是一张不切实际的“救世良方”。其主要失误在于：第一，中国并不存在权威丧失而重建权威的问题，关键倒是怎样科学地使用这些权力；第二，片面地把集权视为法宝，而忽视了一个至关重要的核心问题，即：集权政治的“新权威”应依仗什么树立起来，又凭借什么维持下去？模糊不清地呼唤什么“强人政治”和“集权政治”，等于把社会政治和经济重新推回到改革前的运行轨道，使改革全面退却。缺乏具体分析而照搬别国和地区（四小龙）经验和模式是新权威主义的第三个失误。
              （1988年2月3日《工人日报》）
    于浩成：新权威主义理论的实质仍然是主张由圣君贤相进行统治。
    “新权威主义”思潮认为我国建设现代化用不着推进什么民主化，当前特别需要的是树立集中的权威，要有一个集权的英明的铁腕人物领导我们实现现代化。他们特别举出亚洲四小龙为例，说南朝鲜、新加坡、台湾和香港基本上是专制政体，并没有什么民主化，而它们的经济发展很快。
    这种理由根本是牵强附会的。因为亚洲四小龙都是自由经济，而且是外向型经济，受国际市场的强烈制约，其本国或地区政府对经济的管制作用微乎其微。这同我国这样一个大国主要是产品经济、经济受政治的严密和强烈控制的情况，怎么能够相提并论呢？
    主张新权威主义的论者说，欧洲近代史上曾出现过一个所谓的“专制与自由的蜜月期”，然而，应该看到，欧洲是封建庄园制，中世纪以来，欧洲曾分散成为许多小的诸侯国家。在欧洲的资产阶级民主革命开始之际，新兴资产阶级为了发展商品经济只有拥护皇帝或国王实行民族的统一，借以打破各小国诸侯的封建壁垒，为商品经济的发展创造条件。
    但是中国的情况却有很大的不同，我国历史上的封建制并非庄园式的，从秦始皇统一六国以后，我国就是一个中央集权的封建主义国家。直到慈禧太后以至民国以后的袁世凯等，所有这些统治者都是专制君主，他们不允许有任何发展商品经济的自由，根本谈不上什么“专制与自由的蜜月期”。要发展商品经济，必须建立民主政治。要使经济体制改革取得成功，必须有政治体制改革加以配合甚至先行，这已经为我国以及其他国家的历史经验所证明。新权威主义论者虽然把他们的理论说成是什么新理论，其实仍然是主张由圣君贤相进行统治的陈腐论调，是一种反映农民小生产者的思想和需求的言论。　（《世界经济导报》第429期）
    萧功秦：新权威主义对于中国现代化模式的选择，具有一定的参考和启迪作用。
    并非所有的权威政治均能称为新权威主义。作为一种政治实践的新权威主义，它必须具备以下几个条件，或者是特点。
    首先，新权威主义的治国者在经济上必须具备一定的现代化导向，他所订立的治国、发展目标，应当与世界经济发展的主流——市场化趋同。因此，新权威主义高度强调经济发展、普及教育等目标，以获得最大多数民众的支持。
    其次，新权威主义在政治上凭借庞大及有效的官僚体制及强有力的军事力量，以此来实行自上而下的统治。因此，新权威主义具有政治上的铁腕作风。有时候，军事政治强人为达到政治上的稳定，甚至不惜采用高压手段来镇压政治上的反对派。而在意识形态上，新权威主义对传统的价值体系有更多的认同，认为传统的价值体系是民族精神得以凝聚的基础。
    最后，也就是最为重要的条件是，具备现代化导向的新权威主义，对西方的资本及先进的技术、文化采取开放的政策，希望借此来推动本国资本主义的发展。这一政策的后果，是在国内逐渐形成了一个具有相当经济、文化、政治实力的中产阶级阶层。
    新权威主义具有两重性，它可能向民主政体顺利过渡，也有可能退回到更为保守落后的传统主义。对于第三世界国家来说，新权威主义是一种祸害，然而却是一种不得不接受的“必要的祸害”。
    无论在理论还是现实上，中国均不存在实行上述第三世界国家中的新权威主义政治形态的背景及条件。然而，作为一种政治理论的新权威主义，对于包括中国在内的第三世界国家现代化模式的选择，无疑具有一定的参考及启迪作用。这一点，正是我们今天对其进行研究和讨论的意义所在。　（1989年1月17日《文汇报》）
