The State Council and all levels of local governments must lead by example in implementing clean governance.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 21 — In his government work report, Premier Li Peng said that the State Council and all levels of government must lead by example in implementing the series of clean governance regulations already formulated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.

Li Peng said, "We must severely investigate and punish leaders and directly responsible individuals who violate state regulations by arbitrarily distributing money and goods, using public funds for banquets and gifts, indulging in extravagant feasts, traveling for leisure, and building private homes. We must severely investigate and punish serious instances of bureaucratism and dereliction of duty, especially among state officials and leading cadres. We must uphold the seriousness of state decrees and laws, and resolutely correct the phenomena of disobeying orders and prohibitions, and lack of organization and discipline. For matters that directly affect the interests of the broad masses, we must actively promote the system of open administration and publicize the results of administrative actions. We must increase the transparency of government activities, strengthen the supervisory mechanism, and ensure that all powers are strictly regulated by laws, regulations, and the supervision of the broad masses of cadres and people."

He said, "The departments of industry and commerce, taxation, prices, auditing, customs, and public security, which are responsible for law enforcement and supervision, must strengthen their own construction, improve the political and professional qualities of their personnel, uphold justice, and resolutely and effectively combat illegal and disciplinary violations. The supervisory departments at all levels should focus their work on investigating and punishing corruption, extortion, waste, and various forms of power-seeking behavior, and resolutely curb the trend of corruption. They should concentrate their efforts on promptly investigating and punishing major cases, seize typical cases, handle them publicly, and exert a deterrent effect, so that the work of clean governance can achieve real results."

Li Peng also mentioned that, in order to concentrate efforts on rectification and reform, the planned restructuring of the government organs at the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region levels, which was originally scheduled to begin this year, has been decided to be postponed.

　　国务院和各级地方政府务必带头执行廉政制度
    新华社北京３月２１日电  李鹏总理在政府工作报告中说，对中共中央、国务院已经制定的一系列廉政制度，国务院和各级政府一定要带头执行，做出表率。
    李鹏说，必须严厉查处违反国家规定滥发钱物、用公款请客送礼、大吃大喝、游山玩水、营造私房的有关领导和直接责任者；严厉查处国家工作人员特别是领导干部的严重官僚主义和失职、渎职行为；必须维护政令法令的严肃性，坚决纠正有令不行、有禁不止的无组织无纪律现象。凡处理同广大群众利益直接相关的事情，要积极推行公开办事制度，公开办事结果。要增加政务活动的透明度，强化制约机制，使各种权力的行使都能严格置于法规、制度的规范约束和广大干部、群众的监督之下。他说，工商行政、税务、物价、审计、海关、公安等执法、监督部门必须加强自身建设，提高工作人员的政治和业务素质，秉公执法，坚决有效地同违法违纪现象作斗争。各级监察部门要把工作重点放到查处贪污受贿、敲诈勒索、奢侈浪费和各种以权谋私的行为上来，狠刹腐败风气，集中力量及时查处大案要案，抓住典型事例，公开处理，发挥威慑力量，使廉政工作收到实效。
    李鹏还谈到，为了集中力量搞好治理整顿，原定今年开始的省、直辖市、自治区一级的政府机构改革，决定暂缓进行。
