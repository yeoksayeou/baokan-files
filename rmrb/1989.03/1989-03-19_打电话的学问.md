The Art of Making Phone Calls

    Zhang Qingguang

    The market economy has made people realize the importance of information, and the number of telephones has increased dramatically. Although the telephone bureau is working hard to expand its capacity, it still struggles to meet the demand. The prevalence of telephones can almost be considered a marker of civilization, a "hard" form of civilization that can only develop gradually. Another form of "soft" civilization—the language used on the telephone—seems to have a lot of room for improvement and is worth studying.

    When you dial a number and ask for someone, you often get a response like, "Who is this?" It's polite to the point of being unrefusable. "Who are you to him (her)?" This question sounds a bit off, but it's still tolerable. "What do you want?" The final question is, "He's not here, call back tomorrow!" All that effort and politeness are for nothing! I advise heart patients to use the phone as little as possible. Letters may be slower, but they definitely won't harm your body or mind. There are also people who speak bluntly and efficiently, making it hard for you to react. "Who are you looking for?" "He's not here!" Immediately, you hear a loud "click" as the phone is hung up, which is straightforward and clear. These people are probably very busy with work and value time. Of course, sometimes you might hear a gentle voice: "Hello," "He's not here. If it's urgent, would you like me to relay a message?" This makes you feel grateful and realize that the world is full of love.

    Interestingly, with a bit of attention, you can tell what kind of person someone is just by their phone manner. For example, before you even speak, you hear a long, somewhat off-key sound: "Hello—who is this?" This voice makes you feel that the person has a deep understanding, perhaps they are an important figure? Another type of person changes their tone significantly when answering the phone. Those who seek their help or are of lower status hear a progressively lower and more indifferent tone. Once they realize that the caller is of higher status or that they need something from them, their tone suddenly shifts from low to high, and their voice changes from rough to smooth. You can imagine their body posture changing along with their speech. There is also a type of person who, when answering the phone, doesn't ask who you are looking for but instead asks for your name. If both parties are familiar with each other, it's fine. What's interesting is, if after answering, neither party recognizes the other or if the call was misdialed, you might wonder why the caller asked for your name first?

    The intricacies of telephone etiquette are too deep to be fully explained in a short article. If someone were to write a book titled "The Sociology of Telephones," it would certainly be a great contribution.

    Some people are polite and courteous in front of acquaintances, seemingly like gentlemen. However, their inner flaws are deeply hidden, and they only show their true colors when their personal interests are at stake. In the special context of a telephone conversation, where you only hear the voice and don't see the person, people's psychological defenses relax, revealing their shallowness, darkness, and nosiness. The national psyche has a strong inertia, and overcoming and eradicating it is not a task that can be accomplished in a day. Perhaps, as Marx argued, the ultimate determining force is economic power. Replacing a closed mindset with a broad one, we hope for the high development of modern civilization. But for us living in the "present," we cannot do nothing and just wait for modern civilization to arrive. In fact, only by starting with these small things can we gradually expand the atmosphere of modern civilization, ultimately making our lives more comfortable and pleasant. Just like making a simple phone call, being polite but not verbose, and being concise but not rude, are the basic requirements for telephone language. The "normalization" of telephone communication between people is what telephone users hope for. So, let's start with you and me. This also requires a bit of courage to "set things right."

　　打电话的学问
    张庆广
    商品经济让人们认识信息的重要，电话数量激增，电话局虽拚命引进扩充，怎奈何底气不足，仍难敷需求。电话的普及率庶几可归入文明标志一类，这是“硬性”的文明，只能逐步发展。另一种“软性”文明——电话语言，似乎大有改进的余地，大可研究。
    当您拨通了电话号码，告诉对方要找的人，得到的常常是一声反问：“您是哪位？”客气得使您无法拒绝；“您是他（她）什么人？”一听有些不对味，但尚能忍耐；“找他有什么事？”最后一句“他不在，明天再打！”得，费口舌，赔小心，全没用！奉劝心脏病患者尽量少用电话，写信虽然慢点，但绝无身心损害之虞。还有一种人说话干脆利落，使人反应不过来，“找谁？”“不在！”紧接着“哐”的一声，电话被重重扣在话机上，倒是简单明了。这种人大概工作很忙，事情很多，惜时如金。当然有时也会遇到一声温和的话语：“您好”，“他不在，如果有急事，是否需要转告？”让人感激之情油然升起，顿觉世界充满着爱。
    有意思的是，稍加留心，凭电话便可辨出对方大抵属何种人。比如，你尚未开言，耳机先传出一个很长又有些变调的音符：“喂——哪里？”这声音让您感到他城府很深，或许是一位高不可攀的人物吧？另一种人，接电话时声调变化很大，有求于他的，比他地位低的，他的声调越来越低沉，大有漫不经心的样子。一旦他听出比他地位高或他有求对方时，声调一下由低转向高，音调也随之由粗滑向细，你能想象到他的身体也在随着语言变换着姿势。还有一种人，接电话时，不说找谁，先问对方的姓甚名谁，要是双方都很熟悉也无所谓，有趣的是，若是回答完以后，彼此互不认识或打错了电话，那可就不知道打电话的同志先问对方的姓名是何意了？
    电话里的学问之深，不是一篇小文所能说清的。若有哪位雅士作一部《电话社会学》，肯定是功德之举。
    有些人在熟人面前，客套谦让，彬彬有礼，仿佛是君子。而骨子里那点劣根性则尽量深藏，非到牵涉个人利害时，绝不拉下脸来。而在电话这种只闻其声，不见其人的特殊的对谈方式面前，心理上不免放松下来，那份浅薄，那份阴暗，那份好探人隐私的心态忍不住地时时流露出来。国民的心态具有顽强的惰性，要想克服、根除，远非一日之功。或许仍如马克思所论，最终的决定力量是经济力量。将封闭的心理代之宽广的情怀，我们寄望于现代文明的高度发展。但处于“现在时”的我们，却并非可以什么都不做，袖手等着现代文明的到来。其实，只有越来越多的人从这些小事做起，才能逐渐扩大现代文明的氛围，乃至最终使我们的生活如意起来，舒畅起来。就如这简单的打电话，礼貌而不絮叨，简洁而不粗暴，大致是电话语言的基本要求，人与人之间关系的“电话正常化”是用电话的人所期望的。那么，就从你我开始吧。这也是需要一点“拨乱反正”的勇气的。
