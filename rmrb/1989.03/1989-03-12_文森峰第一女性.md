At the Beijing celebration of International Women's Day, Jin Qingmin, a deputy researcher at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources, moved all listeners with her account of climbing the highest peak in Antarctica.

The highest peak in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, is treacherous and covered in snow year-round, with summer temperatures below -40°C. There is no life here, and it is known as the "death zone." Few have ventured here, but among them is Jin Qingmin—the only woman.

Last November, China and the United States jointly organized a scientific expedition to climb Vinson Massif. The agreement stated that in case of an accident, the body would not be returned to the home country. Jin Qingmin knew this was a test of life and death, but she still went ahead. When she bid farewell to her husband and child, she said, "If something happens to me, don't remember me with tears, but fulfill my wish."

The base camp for the climb was set up at the Patriot Hills. The wind speed here reaches 20 meters per second, making it impossible to hear someone speaking just a few feet away. The weather is extremely cold; when a Chinese team member, Li Zhixin, licked a spoon used to stir coffee, his tongue stuck to it. He tried to pull it off gently but couldn't, and when he pulled harder, a piece of skin came off...

On the third day in Antarctica, while her companions went to climb the main peak of Vinson Massif, Jin Qingmin stayed behind to conduct scientific research.

On the fourth day of her solitary struggle, she set out with ice axes, ice picks, and a hammer for her research. The journey was fraught with blizzards, and she fell countless times. When she reached an altitude of 3,200 meters on Vinson Massif, she discovered red iron sandstones. She struck them with her hammer and immediately identified them as iron ore. She then followed the trail to find the exposed part of the iron ore. Suddenly, one of her feet slipped into a crevice, putting her in great danger. She used her ice pick to grab onto the ice and pulled herself out with great effort. After walking 11 kilometers along the steep mountain, she finally found the exposed part of the iron ore. She excitedly took out the five-star red flag and firmly planted it on the ore body. When she returned to the camp, her comrades had just finished climbing the main peak and returned. The three Chinese embraced and shouted, "Long live!"

It was time to return. Jin Qingmin's luggage was overweight. She did not want to discard a piece of ore sample, so she threw away other items and brought back 40 kilograms of ore, 30 rolls of film, and a notebook. She flew back to her motherland without rest and immediately began her research work.

　　文森峰第一女性
    本报记者  孙健
    北京庆祝三八国际劳动妇女节大会上，南京地质矿产研究所副研究员金庆民介绍的她登南极最高峰的经历，打动了所有听众。
    南极的最高峰——文森峰，山势险峻，终年积雪，夏天气温也低于零下４０℃。这里没有生命，被称为“死亡地带”。到这里来的人屈指可数，可在这可数的人中就有金庆民——唯一的女性。
    去年１１月，中美联合举办攀登南极最高峰——文森峰的科学考察活动，协议上规定：若遇不测，尸体不运回本国。金庆民明知这是场生死的考验，仍毅然前往。她与丈夫、孩子告别时说：“如果我遇到不幸，你们不要用眼泪纪念，要实现我的遗愿。”
    登山大本营设在爱国山基地。这里风速高达２０米／秒，两个人对面说话都听不见。天气特冷，中方队员李致新舔了一下搅咖啡的勺子，舌头就粘在上边，轻拉拉不动，一使劲撕掉一块皮……
    进入南极的第三天，同行的人去登文森峰主峰，金庆民一人留下进行科学考察。
    “孤军奋斗”的第四天，她带着冰杖、冰镐和考察的锤子出发了。一路风雪肆虐，她摔了数不清的跤。当爬到文森峰３２００米高处，发现了红色铁砂岩。她拿起锤子一敲打，立即断定这是铁矿，于是跟踪追迹，寻找铁矿的露天部分。忽然，一只脚掉进冰缝里，十分危险。她用冰镐扒住冰块，拚命往上拔才脱险。沿着陡峭的高山走了１１公里，终于找到了铁矿的露天部分。她激动地取出五星红旗，牢牢地插在那矿体上。回到宿营地，战友正好登完主峰归来，三个中国人抱成一团，高呼“万岁”。
    要返航了，金庆民携物超重。她不愿丢下一块矿石标本，只好扔下其他物品，带着４０公斤重的矿石、３０卷胶片和一个笔记本，飞回了祖国，没有休整就开始了研究工作。
