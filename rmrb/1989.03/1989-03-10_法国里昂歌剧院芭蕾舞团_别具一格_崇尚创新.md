The Lyon Opera Ballet of France has, since its establishment in 1984, performed in numerous countries across Europe, the Americas, and Asia, with over 200 performances to its credit. The troupe has achieved tremendous success and garnered remarkable acclaim, quickly becoming a renowned ballet company in Europe and America.

How has a troupe with only five years of experience managed to achieve such great success? The answer lies in the fact that, from its inception, the troupe has focused on innovation and diversity. It strives to break away from traditional formats and blend classical dance with modern dance. The troupe insists that its choreographers must be innovative. Among the many choreographers in the troupe, there is not a single full-time choreographer. As the director and artistic director, Françoise Adret, puts it, their choreographers are all "temporary choreographers." The troupe uses this approach to ensure that the dance style remains diverse and innovative. The troupe's requirements for dancers are also unique—they do not emphasize having star dancers but rather strive for an overall performance effect. When asked if the ballet troupe has any star dancers, Adret replied, "I don't need stars; the troupe itself is the star." The troupe's dancers come from more than ten countries, including France, the United States, and Algeria.

"Cinderella" is a grand ballet that best showcases the unique characteristics of this ballet troupe. For this classic tale, the choreographers have given it a fresh artistic treatment, imbuing it with a modern consciousness. It blurs the lines between dance and drama, creating a world full of poetry.

Today, the Lyon Opera Ballet has arrived in China, giving Chinese audiences the opportunity to witness its fresh and diverse charm.

　　法国里昂歌剧院芭蕾舞团
    别具一格　崇尚创新
    赵小刚
    法国里昂歌剧院芭蕾舞团自一九八四年建立以来，足迹遍布欧洲、美洲和亚洲的许多国家，演出场次达二百余场，取得了巨大的成功和惊人的演出效果，一跃而成为一个享誉欧美的著名芭蕾舞团。
    一个仅有五年艺龄的剧团何以能取得如此巨大的成功呢？原来，从建团起，剧团就把基点建立在创新和多样化上。力求打破传统的格式，将古典舞与现代舞融为一体。剧团首先要求编导必须具有独创性。在该团众多的编导人员中，竟没有一个是专职的编导。用团长兼艺术指导弗朗索瓦兹·阿德莱的话说，他们的编导都是“临时编导”。剧团以此来使舞蹈风格不断保持多样化和创新性。剧团对舞蹈演员的要求也别具一格——并不强调有尖子演员，而是追求整体演出效果。当有人问及芭蕾舞团是否拥有舞蹈明星时，阿德莱说：“我不需要明星，这个团本身就是明星。”全团演员来自法国、美国、阿尔及利亚等十多个国家。
    《灰姑娘》是一出最能体现这个芭蕾舞团特色的大型舞剧。对这一古老的剧目，编导在艺术上作了崭新的处理，给这部经典童话披上了一层现代意识的色彩。它使舞蹈与戏剧的界线更加模糊和朦胧，创造了一个充满了诗意的世界。
    今天，里昂歌剧院芭蕾舞团来到了中国，使我国观众有幸一睹她那崭新、多姿的风采。（附图片）
