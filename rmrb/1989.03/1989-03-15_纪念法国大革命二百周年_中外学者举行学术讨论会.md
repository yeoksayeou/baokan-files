An academic conference to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution was held today at the academic hall of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. This is one of the activities organized in China to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.

Over a hundred Chinese scholars and a delegation from France, led by Professor Michel Vovelle, Chairman of the Historical Committee of the French National Committee for the Commemoration of the French Revolution, attended the conference. The French Ambassador to China, Marcelle, also attended and spoke at the meeting.

Vice President Zhao Fusan of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences delivered the opening address. He analyzed the influence of the political and philosophical ideas of the French Revolution on modern China during four periods: the revolutionary period of Chinese thought in the early 20th century, the period when Sun Yat-sen led the establishment of the republic, the period when Li Dazhao and Chen Duxiu led the establishment of the Chinese working-class party, and the past ten years. He said that the principles proposed by the French Revolution still have their influence on today's China. Holding this conference in Beijing at this time is not only a review of the past but also a look into the future, especially the development of Sino-French relations in the coming years.

Subsequently, six scholars from both countries gave academic reports. It is understood that the scholars from both countries will also discuss issues such as "The French Revolution and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen" and "The Legacy of the French Revolution."
