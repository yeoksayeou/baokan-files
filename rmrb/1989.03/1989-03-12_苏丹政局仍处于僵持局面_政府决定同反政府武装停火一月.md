People's Daily, Cairo, March 11th.

The political crisis in Sudan remains in a stalemate. Leaders of various political parties and unions held a five-hour meeting yesterday, deciding to suspend any negotiations with the Umma Party regarding the formation of a new government. They also submitted an "urgent memorandum" to the Supreme Committee, unanimously demanding that Prime Minister Mahdi and his cabinet resign within the next 24 hours.

Excluding the Umma Party and the National Islamic Front, representatives of other political parties and unions in Sudan have requested that the Supreme Committee convene a national emergency meeting within the next two days, including military representatives, to reach an agreement on the "National Salvation Government" and the composition of the government.

According to the Middle East News Agency, the Sudanese Unity Democratic Party proposed a cabinet formation plan during this meeting. The Unity Democratic Party and the Umma Party would each hold 9 seats, the unions and southern parties would each hold 4 seats, the military would hold 1 seat, and other parties outside the Constitutional Assembly would hold 3 seats.

The Umma Party and the National Islamic Front have yet to respond to this situation.

The Sudanese military continues to enforce the highest state of alert. The military insists on disarming all militia organizations, making the armed forces the only regular military force in the country.

Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, March 10th.

According to a report by the Sudanese News Agency today, the Sudanese government has decided to accept the United Nations' proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with the rebel forces led by Garang.

The report states that United Nations officials will negotiate the ceasefire date with the rebel forces.

Earlier, United Nations officials had requested a one-month ceasefire in southern Sudan to allow United Nations relief agencies to deliver food and medicine to the region before the rainy season.

According to United Nations statistics, approximately 250,000 people died in southern Sudan in 1988, with the majority starving to death after being stranded in remote areas during the rainy season.

　　苏丹政局仍处于僵持局面
    政府决定同反政府武装停火一月
    本报开罗３月１１日电  记者林皎明报道：苏丹政局危机仍处于僵持局面。各政党和行会头面人物昨天经过５小时磋商，决定中断与乌玛党关于组织新政府的任何协商，并向最高委员会递交“紧急备忘录”，一致要求迈赫迪总理及其内阁在未来２４小时内辞职。
    除乌玛党和全国伊斯兰阵线之外，苏丹其它各政党和行会代表要求最高委员会在未来两天召集包括军方代表参加的全国紧急会议，就“民族救国政府”和政权组成达成协议。
    据埃及中东通讯社披露，苏丹统一民主党在这次磋商中提出新政府的内阁成立分配方案。统一民主党与乌玛党共占９席，行会及南部政党各占４席，军界占１席，宪政大会以外政党占３席。
    乌玛党与全国伊斯兰阵线至今还未就这一形势作出最后反应。
    苏丹军方仍在执行全国最高戒备状态的警戒任务。军方坚持要求解除所有民兵组织的武装，使武装部队成为国家唯一正规军队。
    新华社喀土穆３月１０日电　据苏丹通讯社今天报道，苏丹政府决定接受联合国建议同加朗领导的反政府武装实行为期３０天的停火。
    报道说，联合国官员将同反政府武装商定停火日期。
    联合国官员早些时候要求在苏丹南部停火一个月，以便使联合国救济机构能够把食品和药品在雨季到来之前运到那个地区。
    据联合国统计，１９８８年在苏丹南部大约有２５万人死亡，其中多数人是因雨季被困在偏远地区而饿死的。
