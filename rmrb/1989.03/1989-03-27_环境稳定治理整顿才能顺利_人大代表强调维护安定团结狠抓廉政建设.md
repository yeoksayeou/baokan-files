To complete the arduous and complex task of rectification and readjustment, a good and stable political and social environment is essential; otherwise, nothing can be done well or successfully. This was the consensus among representatives attending the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress as they discussed the government work report in groups over the past few days. They offered many opinions on how to create a good and stable political and social environment to ensure the smooth progress of the rectification and readjustment work.

Many representatives believe that the primary task in creating a good political and social environment is to maintain a stable and united political situation. Jiangsu representative Han Peixin said that at present, it is crucial to improve the ideological and political environment. The unification of ideological understanding should be carried out throughout the entire process of rectification and readjustment, especially by strengthening education on discipline and the overall situation. Various negative trends should be criticized vigorously to guide cadres and the masses to focus on the rectification and readjustment.

Many representatives emphasized the need to crack down on corruption and strengthen the relationship between the party and the people, the government and the people, and the cadres and the people. Shandong representative Jiang Chunyun said that the quality of party discipline directly affects the quality of government discipline and social ethics, and the rise and fall of the party and the state. In recent years, some party members and cadres have failed to withstand the test of material interests, using their power for personal gain, engaging in corruption, and creating unhealthy practices. This is a major issue that has drawn significant public criticism. Therefore, it is crucial to seriously address party and government integrity, strictly govern the party, and strictly manage the government.

Representatives proposed that to create a stable social and political environment, it is necessary to strengthen the authority of the central government. Henan representatives Guo Peiqing, Chang Xiangyu, Ma Xingao, and Gan Yongxiang mentioned that some people use their own methods to counter central policies, distorting them. In the future, those who engage in "having policies at the top and countermeasures at the bottom" and corrupt behavior should be severely punished. Currently, the problem is not that these people are treated too harshly, but rather that they are treated too leniently.

Several representatives pointed out that to create a stable social and political environment, it is necessary to crack down on social order. Guizhou representatives Wen Mingxuan and Zhang Yujuan believe that maintaining social order requires both the masses and specialized agencies. They hope that the State Council and governments at all levels will, like economic construction, invest significant effort into maintaining social order.

Many representatives emphasized that a good and stable political environment depends on further consolidating and developing the great unity among all ethnic groups.

Xinjiang representative Amuduniyazi said that the continuous stable development of various undertakings in Xinjiang is an important reason for the unity and harmony among all ethnic groups. Currently, it is particularly important to enhance the cohesion and centripetal force of all ethnic groups. Any proposal or action that undermines the unity of all ethnic groups and splits the country is absolutely unacceptable.

Some representatives proposed that to maintain a stable political and social environment, it is necessary to maintain the continuity and stability of policies. Some representatives also criticized the lack of specific measures in the government work report regarding the strengthening of anti-corruption efforts and the construction of spiritual civilization.

　　环境稳定治理整顿才能顺利        
    人大代表强调维护安定团结狠抓廉政建设
    新华社北京３月２６日电  “要完成艰巨复杂的治理整顿任务，必须有良好、稳定的政治和社会环境，否则，什么事都干不好，干不成”。出席七届全国人大二次会议的代表这几天分组审议政府工作报告时，就如何创造一个良好、稳定的政治和社会环境以保证治理整顿工作的顺利进行，发表了许多意见。
    许多代表认为，创造良好的政治和社会环境，首要的任务是维护安定团结的政治局面。江苏代表韩培信说，当前要切实搞好思想政治环境，要把统一思想认识贯穿于治理整顿的全过程，特别是要加强纪律和全局观念的教育，对各种不良思潮要展开有力的批评，引导干部群众一心一意搞好治理整顿。
    许多代表强调目前要狠抓廉政建设，密切党群、政群、干群关系。山东代表姜春云说，党风的好坏，直接关系着政风、社会风气的优劣，关系到党和国家的兴衰。近几年少数党员干部经不住物质利益的考验，以权谋私，贪污腐化，搞不正之风，这是群众意见大、反映强烈的一个问题。所以当前要认真抓好党政廉洁，从严治党，从严管政。
    代表们提出，形成稳定的社会政治环境，需要加强中央的权威。河南代表郭培鋆、常香玉、马心高、甘永祥等谈到，现在有些人老用自己的那一套来对付中央，使政策变了形。今后对搞“上有政策，下有对策”和腐败行为的人应该从严查处。现在对这些人并不是失之太严，而是失之太松。
    不少代表指出，形成稳定的社会政治环境，还要狠抓社会治安。贵州代表文明铣、张玉环认为，搞好社会治安，一靠群众，二靠专门机关。希望国务院和各级政府像抓经济建设那样，下大力量抓好社会治安。
    许多代表强调指出，良好、稳定的政治环境有赖于进一步巩固和发展各民族的大团结。
    新疆代表阿木冬·尼牙孜说，新疆各项事业之所以持续稳定发展，一个重要原因是各族人民团结、和谐。当前，特别要增强各族人民的凝聚力和向心力，任何破坏各民族团结、分裂祖国的主张和行动，都是绝对不能允许的。
    一些代表提出，要使政治和社会环境稳定，需要保持政策的连续性和稳定性。一些代表还对政府工作报告中关于加强廉政建设和精神文明建设提出的具体措施不多发表了批评意见。
