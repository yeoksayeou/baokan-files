The challenges we face are not only economic and technological, but also from the dead.

According to relevant departments, last year China had approximately 6.5 million deaths, of which only 1.8 million were cremated. This means that 4.7 million people were buried in the ground. Excluding the western and other remote regions that use barren mountains for burial (approximately one million people), 3.7 million people are buried in the farmland that has been relied on for generations for survival and development. If each grave occupies 0.2 mu (1/15th of an acre), then the country loses 740,000 mu of farmland each year, which is more than the entire area of the Seychelles.

China's population accounts for 23% of the world's total, but the per capita arable land is only 1/3 of the world's average, equivalent to 1/7 of the per capita arable land in the United States. In the past 30 years, China's net loss of land has been 240 million mu, equivalent to the size of France. In recent years, an average of 8 million mu of arable land has been lost each year (equivalent to the arable land of Qinghai Province), resulting in a reduction of 2.5 billion kilograms of grain production per year. Land is being consumed day by day, and the human living space is shrinking, while the trend of disorderly occupation of farmland due to funeral customs is increasing rather than decreasing!

Wenzhou, with a population of less than 7 million, has seven mountains, one water, and two parts farmland. However, 30,000 graves appear here every year, resulting in the loss of 1 million square meters of land annually! In Hongqiao Township, Leqing County, farmer Shang spent more than 5,000 yuan to expand the ancestral grave. The cement courtyard in the cemetery can accommodate more than ten people sitting for a meeting. In Ruian County, a Chen clan's tomb cost more than 20,000 yuan and covered 265 square meters. In some places, graves have become group buildings, and the ancient chair graves are gradually developing into pavilion-style and garden-style tombs. In Zhejiang, the arable land lost each year due to grave construction is equivalent to the total arable land of a medium-sized county; in Henan Province, 15 million old graves not only occupy 300,000 mu of land but also have more than 330,000 new graves appearing in the fields every year. The scattered graves are like numerous scars on the body of Mother Earth, shocking to behold!

Where graves are built, the trees groan! In Wenzhou, it is common to cut down "feng shui trees" during funerals. The trees around the graves are cut down, and the graves are covered with green grass. According to statistics, just for coffin wood, each deceased person uses an average of 0.5 cubic meters of wood, and 2.3 million cubic meters of wood are buried each year nationwide, equivalent to the annual logging volume of one of China's four major forest regions, Fujian Province.

The challenge of the dead to the living is most prominently reflected in the fact that feudal zombies are "reviving" in real life. In recent years, some officials and residents in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, have been fighting over ancestral property and "dragon veins," with frequent disputes and brawls. Since 1987, the county has built more than 5,000 "living graves," of which 35% were built by officials and employees. In some places in Wenzhou, graves are built as soon as a child is born.

Building "living graves" has even become a "benchmark" for filial piety in some places. However, some children are eager to build "living graves" but indifferent to their living parents. According to the investigation by the Office of the Communist Party of China Linxiang County Committee, in half of the households that built "living graves," the elderly have a miserable old age, and some even have to beg for a living. In Dahu Village, Peng built a "living grave" for his living father, with the word "filial son" prominently carved on the tombstone. However, he often beat and scolded his father in daily life. After his father's death, Peng spent more than 3,000 yuan on the funeral and was praised by some villagers as a "filial son."

The prevalence of earth burial has also led to an increase in funeral "consumption." Seeking blessings from gods, burning incense and paper, inviting monks and Taoist priests to chant scriptures, which item does not require money? In Wenzhou, it is said that "the wealth of a family can be seen from its graves," and there is a competition in the scale and style of grave construction. Often, one deceased person can "consume" one or two "millionaires." In 1987, the funeral expenses in Yixing County, Jiangsu Province, amounted to 11.1 million yuan. In Hunan Province, the annual funeral "consumption" reached 700 million yuan. Many of the involved parties have accumulated huge debts due to grand funerals, even leading to bankruptcy!

Funeral customs have become a major social hazard. Unemployed witches and shamans have returned to their old trades, and a group of "superstitious specialists" such as "cutting funeral clothes," "printing funeral money," and "making paper TVs" have emerged. Officials from the Ministry of Civil Affairs believe that it is time to seriously clean up funeral customs. However, administrative orders alone will not be effective; the entire society should pay sufficient attention to this issue.

### 死者对生者的挑战

　　死者对生者的挑战
    本报记者  舒瑜
    我们面临的不仅是经济、科技的挑战，也面临着死者的挑战。
    据有关部门测算，去年我国约有死亡人口６５０万，其中火化者仅１８０万。就是说，全国尚有４７０万人实行土葬。除去西北等边远地区利用荒山土葬外（大约近百万人），有３７０万人土葬占用的是世世代代赖以生存、发展的耕地。若以每座坟头占有０．２亩计算，全国每年丧失耕地７４万亩，比塞舌尔的整个国家面积还要多。
    我国人口占世界的２３％，人均占有耕地仅为世界人均占地的１／３，相当于美国人均耕地的１／７。３０年来，我国土地净减２．４亿亩，等于一个法国。近几年，平均每年约减少８００万亩耕地（相当于一个青海省的耕地），年少产粮食２５亿公斤。土地在一天天被吞噬，人类的生命圈在缩小，而殡葬陋习导致的乱占耕地的势头却有增无减！
    人口不足７００万的温州，七山一水二分田。但在这里，每年却要冒出３万座坟墓，每年约损失１００万平方米的土地！乐清县虹桥乡农民尚某花５０００多元扩建太祖坟，墓区的水泥空地上足可以容纳十几个人坐着开会。瑞安县一个陈氏宗族墓造价２万余元，占地２６５平方米。在一些地方，坟头已成群体建筑，古老的椅子坟逐渐向凉亭式、园林式陵墓发展。浙江每年因修坟损失耕地相当一个中等县的全部耕地；河南省１５００万个旧坟不仅占地３０万亩，而且每年还有３３万多个新坟出现在农田里。星罗棋布的坟墓就像大地母亲身上的累累疤痕，令人触目惊心！
    建坟之处，树木一片呻吟！在温州，办丧事盛行砍“风水树”。墓周树木伐尽，坟头青草萋萋。据统计，仅棺木用材一项，每一死者平均用材０．５立方米，全国每年有２３０万立方米的木材被埋葬掉，相当于我国四大林区之一福建省一年的采伐量。
    死者对生者的挑战，最突出的还表现在封建僵尸仍在现实生活中“还魂”。近年来，湖南临湘县部分干部群众争“祖业”，占“龙脉”，纠纷、械斗时有所闻。１９８７年以来，全县共建“活人墓”５０００多座，其中干部、职工建的达３５％。温州一些地方，小孩刚出生，坟都已经造好了。
    建“活人墓”甚至成为某些地方衡量儿女是否孝顺的“标志”。而一些儿女热衷于建“活人墓”，却对活着的老人漠不关心。据中共湖南省临湘县委办公室调查，建“活人墓”的户中，有一半的老人晚景凄凉，有的老人甚至靠乞讨度生。该县大屋村彭某，给在世的父亲建了“活人墓”，墓碑上赫然刻着“孝子”字样，然而他对父亲平常的侍奉却是又打又骂。其父死后，彭某大办丧事花去３０００多元，倒被村里一些人誉为“孝子”。
    土葬盛行，丧葬“消费”也日渐加码。求神拜佛、烧香烧纸、请和尚道士念经，哪一项少得了钱？温州流传着“富不富看坟墓”，在造墓的规模、式样上竞相攀比，一个死人往往要“吃掉”一两个“万元户”。江苏省宜兴县１９８７年丧葬费是１１１０万元。湖南省一年丧葬“消费”达７亿元人民币。不少当事者因大办丧事而债台高筑，甚至倾家荡产！
    殡葬陋习已成为一大社会公害。早已失业的巫婆神汉又重操旧业，一批“剪冥衣”、“印冥钱”、“扎纸彩电”的“迷信专业户”应运而生。民政部有关人士认为，殡葬陋习是到了认真清扫的时候了。但是，仅靠行政命令是不能奏效的，全社会都应予以足够的重视。
