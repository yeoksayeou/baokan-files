Strengthen Development and Construction to Enhance Development Momentum

Eight New Commercial Grain and Cotton Base Areas Established

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 25th: Approved by the National Land Development and Construction Fund Management Leading Group, eight regions in China have been designated as national commercial grain and cotton production base areas for key development and construction this year.

These regions are: the southern part of Hunan Province, the central part of the Jianghan Plain and the northern hilly areas of Hubei Province, parts of eastern Inner Mongolia, the central part of Sichuan Province, the southwestern part of Jiangxi Province, the irrigated areas south of Yinchuan in Ningxia, the Yellow River Delta in Shandong, and parts of Hainan Province. These are the second batch of projects designated for national key development and construction.

It is understood that the funds allocated by the state for strengthening agricultural key construction include six items such as land use tax. Relevant departments have estimated that tens of billions of yuan will be raised nationwide. Most of this fund will be managed by local governments at various levels. The portion of the fund managed by the state has established the National Land Development and Construction Fund, which is earmarked for special use and directly used for the projects that started last year and the eight new projects added this year. This large investment is, in principle, half provided by the state as a grant and half as a loan with repayment at a later date.

　　加强开发建设　增强发展后劲　
    我新增八个商品粮棉基地
    据新华社北京３月２５日电  经国家土地开发建设基金管理领导小组审定，今年我国又有８个地区列为国家商品粮棉生产基地，进行重点开发建设。
    它们是：湖南省的湘南地区、湖北省的江汉平原腹地和鄂北岗地、内蒙古东部部分地区、四川省的川中地区、江西省的赣西南地区、宁夏银川以南灌溉区、山东的黄河口三角洲以及海南省部分地区。这是列为国家重点开发建设的第二批项目。
    据了解，国家确定用于加强农业重点建设的资金包括耕地占用税等共有６项，有关部门测算，全国将要筹集几十亿元。这笔资金大部分由地方各级政府掌握。国家掌握的这一部分资金，建立了国家土地开发建设基金，专款专用，直接用于去年已开工的项目和今年新增加的８个项目。这笔巨额投资，原则上一半为国家无偿支援；一半为有偿扶持，定期收回。
