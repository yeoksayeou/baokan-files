Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 21st.

A 1907 Itala vintage car that once traveled from Beijing to Paris has recently been taken out of a museum and transported to Beijing. It will participate for the second time in the 1989 Beijing to Paris old car expedition, which is set to begin on the evening of March 25th.

This expedition, jointly organized by the China International Sports Tourism Company and the Italian International Hiking Tourism Company, will depart from Beijing and follow the ancient Silk Road. The route will pass through Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and exit China via Red Its Lapu in Xinjiang. The journey will then continue through Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, the Soviet Union, Poland, the Netherlands, and finally reach Paris before the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.

The organizers hope that through this 110-day, 20,000-kilometer old car expedition, they can enhance friendship and understanding between the peoples of Europe and Asia. This expedition will also commemorate the pioneering feat of three Italians who first drove across the Eurasian continent in 1907. The drivers of this vintage car will be two professional drivers from the Fiat Automobile Company of Italy.

　　远征四万里　横贯十一国        
    北京至巴黎之路老式汽车远征即将开始
    本报北京３月２１日讯  １９０７年曾由北京驶达巴黎的一辆伊塔拉老式汽车，最近被请出博物馆，并运抵北京，它将第二次参加于３月２５日晚开始的横跨欧亚大陆的１９８９年北京巴黎之路老式汽车远征活动。
    此次由中国国际体育旅游公司、意大利国际徒步旅游公司等联合组织的远征活动将从北京出发，沿古老的丝绸之路，经河北、河南、陕西、甘肃、青海，由新疆红其拉甫出境，然后经巴基斯坦、伊朗、土耳其、苏联、波兰、荷兰等１０个国家，最后在法国大革命２００周年纪念日前抵达巴黎。
    组织者希望通过这次历时１１０天、行程２万公里的老式汽车远征，增进欧亚各国人民之间的友谊和了解，纪念三名意大利人１９０７年首次驾车横跨欧亚大陆的创举。驾驶这辆老式汽车的驾驶员将是意大利菲亚特汽车公司的两名专业车手。
