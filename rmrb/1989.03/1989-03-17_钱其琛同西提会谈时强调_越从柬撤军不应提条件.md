Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 16th.

Qian Qichen emphasized today that "Vietnam's complete withdrawal from Cambodia should not be subject to any conditions. It is unreasonable for Vietnam to attempt to use withdrawal as a bargaining chip. As Vietnam withdraws from Cambodia, the international community can gradually reduce and even stop aid to the various factions in Cambodia. However, this can only be the result of Vietnam's withdrawal, not a precondition."

Foreign Minister Qian made these remarks this afternoon during talks with Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. The two foreign ministers exchanged in-depth views on the latest developments in the Cambodian issue.

Foreign Minister Qian also said that on the Cambodian issue, the fundamental goals of China and Thailand are the same. The current overall international situation is very favorable for a political settlement of the Cambodian issue. Vietnam is isolated. Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia should be condemned. Currently, Vietnam still insists that the future Cambodian government should be based on the Hun Sen-Heng Samrin group, which means that Vietnam's attempt to continue controlling Cambodia through the Hun Sen-Heng Samrin regime has not changed. Therefore, the international community should continue to exert pressure on Vietnam and should not legitimize the Hun Sen-Heng Samrin regime or elevate its status. Only in this way can we promote an early political settlement of the Cambodian issue.

Foreign Minister Siddhi said that during Prime Minister Chatchai's visit to China, he exchanged views with Chinese leaders on the Cambodian issue and achieved significant results. Prime Minister Chatchai reiterated Thailand's continued support for the three resistance forces of the Khmer Rouge and the establishment of a four-party interim joint government in Cambodia with Prince Sihanouk as the leader. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the cooperation between China and Thailand on the Cambodian issue.

### 钱其琛同西提会谈时强调  越从柬撤军不应提条件

　　钱其琛同西提会谈时强调
    越从柬撤军不应提条件
    本报北京３月１６日讯  记者温宪报道：中国外长钱其琛今天强调说：“越南自柬埔寨全部撤军不应提什么条件，越南企图把撤军作为交换条件，这是没有道理的。随着越南自柬埔寨撤军，外界可以逐步减少乃至停止对柬各方的援助。但这只能是越南撤军的结果，而不能是先决条件。”
    钱外长是今天下午在钓鱼台国宾馆与泰国外长西提会谈时说这番话的。两国外长主要就柬埔寨问题的最新发展深入地交换了意见。
    钱外长还说，在柬埔寨问题上，中泰两国的根本目标一致。当前总的国际形势对政治解决柬问题很有利，越南处境孤立。越南侵略柬埔寨应该受到谴责。当前，越南仍坚持未来的柬埔寨政府以韩桑林—洪森集团为主体，也就是说，越南企图通过韩桑林—洪森政权来继续控制柬埔寨的打算没有改变。因此，国际社会应继续对越南保持压力，不能使韩—洪政权合法化，也不能提高它的地位。只有这样，才能推动柬埔寨问题早日得到政治解决。
    西提外长说，这次差猜总理访华，同中国领导人就柬埔寨问题交换意见，取得了很大成果。差猜总理重申了泰国继续支持民柬三方抵抗力量和在柬埔寨成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。双方对中泰在柬埔寨问题上的合作表示满意。
