Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 22nd.

The improvement of the multi-party cooperation system will become one of the important tasks of China's political system reform starting this year. This was revealed by Yan Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and head of the United Front Work Department, at a symposium held in Beijing today.

Yan Mingfu also mentioned that selecting personnel from democratic parties and non-partisan individuals to serve in various levels of government is part of the effort to improve the multi-party cooperation system under the leadership of the Communist Party.

Yan Mingfu stated that currently, relevant central departments are consulting with democratic parties and people from various sectors to recommend and select more non-Communist Party members to take on government leadership roles. He predicted that an initial plan for this work could be proposed by June or July this year.

Today's symposium, organized jointly by the United Front Work Department, the Organization Department, and the Personnel Department of the CPC Central Committee, was attended by: Feng Ti Yun, Vice Chairman of the China National Democratic Construction Association and Vice Minister of the Supervision Department; He Lu Li, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and Vice Mayor of Beijing; Zhang Xu Wu, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and Vice Governor of Jiangsu Province; Chen Gui Zun, member of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League and Vice Governor of Jiangxi Province; Li Pei Yao, Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and newly appointed Vice Minister of the Ministry of Labor; and Hong Li Zeng, Vice Chairman of the Jiusan Society in Jilin Province and Vice Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture.

It is reported that non-party personnel participating in government leadership is a tradition of the Communist Party. In the early days of the founding of the nation, democratic party members and non-partisan individuals such as Song Qing Ling, Li Ji Sheng, and Zhang Lan served as Vice Presidents of the state. Huang Yan Pei and Guo Mo Ruo served as Vice Premiers of the State Council. Fifteen individuals, including Fu Zuo Yi, Li De Quan, and Shi Liang, served as ministers in the government.

　　阎明复在一座谈会上透露        
    多选党外人士到政府任职     
    下半年可望提出初步方案
    本报北京３月２２日讯  记者张何平报道：完善多党合作制，从今年起将成为我国政治体制改革的重要课题之一。这是中共中央书记处书记、中央统战部长阎明复今天在此间透露的。
    阎明复还说，选拔民主党派和无党派人士到各级政府任职，是完善共产党领导的多党合作制的内容之一。
    阎明复说，现在，中央有关部门正在同民主党派、各界人士协商，以推荐和选拔更多的非共产党员干部担任政府领导工作。他预计，这项工作可望于今年六七月份提出初步方案。
    今天，出席由中共中央统战部、组织部和人事部联合召集的座谈会的有：民建中央副主席、监察部副部长冯梯云，民革中央副主席、北京市副市长何鲁丽，全国工商联副主席、江苏省副省长张绪武，民盟中央委员、江西省副省长陈癸尊，以及刚刚被任命为劳动部副部长的民革中央副主席李沛瑶，农业部副部长、吉林省九三学社副主委洪绂曾等。
    据介绍，党外人士参加政府领导工作，是共产党的传统。建国初期，民主党派和无党派人士的宋庆龄、李济深、张澜任国家副主席，黄炎培、郭沫若任政务院副总理，傅作义、李德全、史良等１５位人士任政府部长。
