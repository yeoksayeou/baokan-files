In recent years, the United States has experienced a series of serious air disasters. Apart from issues related to the aircraft's structure or quality and the impact of natural weather conditions, these incidents are also linked to pilots' excessive fatigue, which can lead to loss of control of the aircraft. Some scientists involved in aerospace research have revealed that some American pilots have been caught napping during flights. Pilots flying international routes in the U.S. often have to spend about ten days each month away from home, frequently flying for more than 10 hours at a time. Experts believe that there are several reasons why pilots are prone to falling asleep.

Firstly, intense competition among airlines leads companies to cut costs and reduce staff, resulting in extremely tight flight schedules. Secondly, pilots often have to frequently cross international date lines, causing jet lag that disrupts their biological rhythms, making it difficult for them to sleep even after landing. Additionally, while computers and automatic control systems have reduced the workload for pilots, the lack of tasks other than monitoring instruments makes it easy for drowsiness to set in.

Airlines strictly prohibit pilots from sleeping on the job, and any pilot caught doing so will be dismissed. However, a Boeing 747 captain responsible for cargo flights admitted that, to his knowledge, every pilot in his company has fallen asleep on the job. A captain from United Airlines also assured that many pilots flying over the Pacific Ocean also nod off during flights.

　　可怕！飞行员打瞌睡
    近一两年，美国连续发生恶性空难事故。这除了飞机结构或质量本身的原因和自然气候等因素的影响外，还与飞行员的过度疲劳从而导致飞机失控也不无关系。据一些从事航空航天研究的科学家披露，美国有些飞行员居然在飞行途中打瞌睡。美国飞国际航线的飞行员，每月总有十来天无法呆在家里，他们往往一上飞机就得连续飞行１０个小时以上。专家认为，飞行员之所以容易打瞌睡有好几个原因。
    首先是各航空公司竞争激烈，为了节省开支，裁减人员，公司方面不得不排出非常紧凑的飞行日程表。其次是一些飞行员往往要频频飞越国际日期变更线，时差反应打乱了他们的生理节律，以至走下飞机后仍然无法入睡。再次是电脑和自动控制系统确实减轻了飞行员的工作强度，但飞行员除了监视仪表外便无事可干，这样睡意便容易阵阵袭来。
    各航空公司是严禁飞行员在工作中打瞌睡的，如发现则将予以辞退。然而一位承担货运任务的波音７４７机长却说，就他所知该公司的每个飞行员都打瞌睡。联合航空公司的一位机长还打保票，说许多飞越太平洋的飞行员也打瞌睡。
