The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) are collaborating with China to launch the "Development of Primary Maternal and Child Health in China" project. Between 1990 and 1994, these two funds will provide $20 million in aid to 300 counties in China's remote and impoverished regions.

It is understood that since the 1980s, China's infant mortality rate and maternal mortality rate have been 34 per thousand and 0.5 per thousand, respectively, ranking among the 80-plus positions out of over 130 countries. Regions with high infant, child, and maternal mortality rates are mostly concentrated in remote and impoverished areas. The implementation of aid from the two UN funds will not only significantly boost China's maternal and child health work and family planning efforts but also provide valuable experience for other developing countries internationally.

　　联合国无偿提供两千万美元  我贫困地区妇幼保健可改善
    本报北京３月１４日讯  记者艾笑报道：卫生部今天公布，联合国儿童基金会联合国人口基金与我国合作开展《发展中国基层妇幼卫生》项目。这两个基金会在１９９０至１９９４年间，将为我国老少边穷地区的３００个县提供无偿援助２０００万美元。
    据了解，进入８０年代后，我国婴儿死亡率和产妇死亡率，分别是３４‰和０．５％，居世界１３０多个国家中８０多位。婴儿、儿童、孕产妇死亡率较高的地区，大多集中在老少边穷地区。联合国两个基金会无偿援助的实施，不仅对我国妇幼卫生工作、计划生育工作是一个很大的推动，而且在国际上对其它发展中国家也能提供有益的经验。
