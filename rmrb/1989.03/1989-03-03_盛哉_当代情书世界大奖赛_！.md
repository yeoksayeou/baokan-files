Title: Magnificent! The "Contemporary Love Letter World Championship"!

Recently, I read in several newspapers about the "World Love Letter Championship." At first glance, I thought it might be some prank by Western countries on "April Fool's Day," or perhaps a sensational headline from the 1930s in Shanghai. Upon closer reading, it turned out to be a "Contemporary Love Letter World Championship" solemnly launched by a domestic magazine, aimed at "readers around the world"! The announcement stated the purpose of the championship as: "Through the form of love letters, convey contemporary people's thoughts, feelings, and life experiences, reflect the spiritual landscape of human society, praise beautiful love, and exchange the art of love... Build a bridge for people from various countries and regions to make friends and connect emotionally..."

Oh, magnificent! Truly a pioneering achievement of the times, opening a new chapter in the history of love. Observing its purpose, how grand and lofty! Considering its function, how miraculous and wonderful! It makes one involuntarily applaud the aspirations and "beauty" of the magazine's editors!

Who will judge the winners? Naturally, it won't be some prince who falls in love after reading this letter and marries the sender, or some local beauty. It must be judged by a group of "judges" (among whom, of course, there will be some leaders, famous writers, celebrities, contemporary singers, beauty queens, etc.) who will unanimously praise it.

Unfortunately, in this "lofty" purpose, "love" and "friendship" are confused, and the "exclusivity" and "exclusiveness" of love are eliminated. "Building a bridge for people from various countries and regions to make friends and connect emotionally," is there really such a "bridge"? The purpose is high, but it may be too high to inspire any serious writer or serious lover to write such a "love letter."

I believe the editors of that magazine are also very clear about this logic. Since this is the case, why bother with such an "April Fool's Day" gimmick? The answer, I'm afraid, lies in the phrase "aimed at readers around the world." It seems that once this advertisement is released, and the "Contemporary Love Letter World Championship" begins, "readers around the world" will "face" our country's magazine, and this magazine will "step onto the world stage."

Is this an innovative move towards "thought liberation"? Or is it a cultural decline?

To fantasize about "stepping onto the world stage" in this way, is it not sad?

What kind of cultural mentality is this? It makes me suddenly think that the policy of opening up is far-reaching. Even in the historical corner of Lu Xun's "Weizhuang," it has "opened up," and Ah Q is now eager to "step onto the world stage." In matters of love, he is no longer satisfied with just touching the "oily" face of the little nun; he wants to learn from the pseudo-foreign devils, write love letters, and seriously "build" bridges for people from various countries and regions to make friends and connect emotionally, so that the blue-eyed, blonde-haired foreign girls can also get to know Ah Q's handsome and charming bald head...

Oh, magnificent! Oh, strange! Such a "Contemporary Love Letter World Championship"! If there is a domestic newspaper or magazine that launches the "1988 China Literary (or Publishing) Ten Major Strange Events Championship," then the "Contemporary Love Letter World Championship" might well take the top spot, right?

### 盛哉“当代情书世界大奖赛”！

    盛哉“当代情书世界大奖赛”！
    杨群
    前不久，在几家报纸上读到有关“世界情书大奖赛”的消息。乍一看，原以为倘若不是西方国家“愚人节”摆弄的什么玩意儿，就是30年代上海滩头小报哗众取宠的“噱头”。细读之下，竟是国内某杂志隆重推出的“面向全世界读者”的“当代情书世界大奖赛”！消息揭示大奖赛的“宗旨”为：“通过情书的形式，传达当代人的思想感情和生活感受，反映人类社会精神风貌，赞颂美好爱情，交流爱的艺术……为各国各地区人民交友联情架设桥梁……”。
    噫欤盛哉！诚划时代之创举，开恋爱史之先河也。观其“宗旨”，何等“伟大”、“崇高”。考其作用，何等“神奇”、“美妙”！使人不禁为这家杂志编辑的抱负和“美妙”拍手叫绝！
    谁来评奖呢？自然不是哪一位读到这封情书而堕入爱河、委身相与的白马王子或敝国莺莺小姐。少不得由众多的“评委”们（其中自然又少不得有某某领导、著名作家、知名人士、当代歌星、健美小姐……）共同评定，一致叫好。
    可惜，这“崇高”的宗旨中，却把“爱情”和“友情”混同了，把爱情的“专一性”和“排他性”抹杀了。“为各国各地区人民交友联情架设桥梁”，果真有这样的“桥梁”么？这宗旨“高”则高矣，但恐怕再高也激发不起任何一位严肃的作家或严肃的爱的追求者写得出这么一封“情书”来。
    这道理，我相信那家杂志的编辑们也是十分清楚的。既然如此，为什么还要搞这类“愚人节”的玩意儿呢？说穿了，答案恐怕还在“面向全世界读者”这句话。似乎这广告一出，“当代情书世界大奖赛”一开锣，“全世界读者”就“面向”敝国的这家杂志，这家杂志也就“走向世界”了。
    这是“思想解放”的创举？还是文化瘠土的滑坡？
    幻想如此“走向世界”，不亦悲夫！
    这是什么样的一种文化心态呢？它使我忽然想到，开放政策，无远弗届。连远在历史角落里的鲁迅笔下的“未庄”也“开放”了，阿Q正一心想要“走向世界”。在两性问题上，他再也不满足于摸摸小尼姑的“油腻腻的脸旦”，一心想学假洋鬼子，写起情书来，还一本正经的要“架设”各国各地区人民交友联情的“桥梁”，好让蓝眼碧发的洋妞儿们也认识认识咱阿Q的英俊迷人的光头……
    噫欤盛哉！噫欤怪哉！如此“当代情书世界大奖赛”！倘若国内有哪家报刊发起举办“1988年中国文坛（或出版界）十大奇闻奇事大奖赛”，则“当代情书世界大奖赛”可能会荣登榜首的吧？
