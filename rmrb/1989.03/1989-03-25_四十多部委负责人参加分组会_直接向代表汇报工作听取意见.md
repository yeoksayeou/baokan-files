Over 40 department heads from the State Council and its 40-plus ministries, commissions, and directly affiliated bureaus participated in the group meetings of the 32 delegations of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress yesterday and today. They directly reported their work to the representatives and listened to the representatives' opinions on the government's work. The representatives generally believed that this is a good way for the government to accept supervision from the NPC.

	So many government department heads directly reporting to NPC representatives and soliciting opinions is unprecedented in previous NPC sessions.

	Supervising the government's work is a major function of the state's legislative body. In recent years, the NPC and its Standing Committee have made progress in strengthening supervision over the government.

	The representatives believe that strengthening supervision and actively accepting supervision should not be limited to the period when the People's Congress is in session, but should be regularized and institutionalized. During the closed sessions of the People's Congress at all levels, from the State Council to local governments, regular reports should be made to the Standing Committee of the People's Congress, opinions should be solicited, and supervision should be accepted.

　　四十多部委负责人参加分组会        
    直接向代表汇报工作听取意见
    据新华社北京３月２４日电  （记者杨国钧）国务院和国务院４０多个部、委以及直属局的负责人参加了昨天和今天七届全国人大二次会议３２个代表团审议政府工作报告的分组会，直接向代表们汇报政府工作，听取代表们对政府工作的意见。代表们普遍认为，这是政府接受人大监督的好形式。
    这样多的政府部门负责人直接向人大代表报告工作，征求意见，过去历次人代会会议上还没有过。
    对政府工作实施监督是国家权力机关的一项主要职能。近几年，全国人大及其常委会在加强对政府的监督方面取得了进展。
    代表们认为，加强监督和主动接受监督不应局限在人民代表大会开会期间，而应当经常化和制度化。在各级人民代表大会闭会期间，从国务院到地方各级政府都应经常向人大常委会汇报工作，听取意见，接受监督。
