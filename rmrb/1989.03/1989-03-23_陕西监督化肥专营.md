Shaanxi Monitors Specialized Fertilizer Distribution

	Xian, March 22 (Xinhua) -- As the spring planting and fertilizer application season approaches, the Shaanxi Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission and the Provincial Supervision Bureau, in collaboration with relevant departments, have implemented a system of "public allocation, certificate issuance to households, comprehensive supervision, and strict investigation and punishment."

	Last year, approximately 66% of the planned supply of subsidized fertilizer was resold at higher prices, resulting in farmers losing about 200 million yuan to middlemen's price gouging.

	In response, the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission and the Provincial Supervision Bureau have decided to publicly announce the fertilizer quotas allocated by the state to the province, prefectures, counties, and townships, as well as the allocation policies, supply prices, and allocation plans. They will also ensure that the fertilizer allocated to each household is specified and a supply certificate is issued.

　　陕西监督化肥专营
    本报西安３月２２日电  记者孟西安报道：春耕追肥时节，陕西省纪委和省监察厅会同有关部门，实施化肥“分配公开，发证到户，全面监督，严肃查处”的办法。
    去年，全省计划内供应的平价化肥，约有６６％被加价倒卖，农民大约有２亿元资金被中间环节高价盘剥。
    为此，省纪委、省监察厅决定将今年国家分配给省、地、县、乡的化肥指标、分配政策、供应价格和分配方案层层公布于众。将分配给每户农民的化肥落实到户，签发供应证。
