Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 20th. The second session of the Seventh National People's Congress opened this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People in the capital.

Premier Li Peng delivered a government work report titled "Firmly Implementing the Policies of Rectification and Deepening Reform." He pointed out that rectifying the economic environment and economic order is the key focus for China's construction and reform in the next two years, and it is also the key focus of the government's work.

Li Peng emphasized that, overall, the current domestic and international situation is favorable for China's construction and reform. The difficulties we face in domestic economic construction are problems of progress and development. As long as we unite and work together, we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and achieve the expected goals in rectification and deepening reform.

Today, 2,768 representatives, bearing the trust of the people of all ethnic groups nationwide, gathered in the Great Hall to discuss national affairs.

The 18 standing members of the presidium, along with Zhao Ziyang, Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Li Xiannian, Qiao Shi, Hu Qili, Yao Yilin, Wang Zhen, and other members of the presidium, took their seats on the platform to the applause of the audience.

At 3 PM, the presiding chairman and standing member of the presidium, Wan Li, announced the opening of the session. The entire audience stood as the military band played the national anthem.

In the midst of warm applause, Premier Li Peng walked to the podium to deliver the government work report. His report, approximately 25,000 characters long, was divided into eight parts: focusing on rectification and reform; the current focus of rectification is still to reduce social demand; seriously rectifying economic order, especially the circulation order; adjusting the economic structure during rectification; ensuring the development of science and technology and education during rectification; closely combining rectification with deepening reform; actively developing opening up during rectification; and striving to create a stable social and political environment. Li Peng also discussed the issue of national reunification and diplomatic work in his report.

Li Peng said that the year 1988, which has just passed, was a year of continued progress in China's socialist modernization.

He said that while we have achieved results in various areas of work, we also face many problems and difficulties, the most prominent of which is the emergence of obvious inflation, with excessive price increases.

Li Peng pointed out that the above situation is related to the fact that during the transition period from the old to the new system, it is not possible to quickly form a new self-regulating and self-constraining mechanism. However, at the same time, there are also shortcomings and mistakes in our guidance of work. Overall, in economic construction and social development, there is a tendency to seek quick results.

Li Peng then discussed the initial achievements of the half-year rectification in reducing the scale of fixed asset investment, controlling the scale of credit, increasing savings and stabilizing finance, reducing the purchasing power of social groups, conducting nationwide financial, tax, and price inspections, rectifying the order in the circulation sector, and increasing effective supply. He said that after half a year of work, the economic overheating has begun to cool down, the momentum of price increases has weakened, the public's anxiety about prices has eased, and urban and rural markets have basically stabilized.

Li Peng pointed out that for the half-year rectification, two basic assessments should be made: First, the policies and measures for rectification determined by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council are correct. Second, the achievements made so far are only initial ones, and there is still a big gap between them and the goals of rectification. We can only face difficulties head-on and cannot give up halfway.

During Li Peng's report, the audience applauded warmly several times.

The presiding chairmen for today's session were the standing members of the presidium: Hu Zongxun, Peng Chong, Wei Guoqing, Zhu Lekun, Apao Awang Jinmei, Saifuding Aizisi, Zhou Gucheng, Yan Jici, Rong Yiren, Ye Fei, Liao Hansheng, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muxia, Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, Wang Hanbin.

　　两千七百多名代表肩负各族人民嘱托共商国家大计        
    七届人大二次会议在京开幕        
    万里宣布大会开幕　李鹏作政府工作报告
    新华社北京３月２０日电  第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议今天下午在首都人民大会堂开幕。
    国务院总理李鹏在会上作了题为《坚决贯彻治理整顿和深化改革的方针》的政府工作报告。他指出，治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序，是今明两年我国建设和改革的重点，也是政府工作的重点。
    李鹏强调指出，总的来看，当前的国内和国际形势对我国的建设和改革都是有利的。我们在国内经济建设中面临的困难是前进中的问题，发展中的问题，只要我们上下一致，群策群力，就一定能够共渡难关，在治理整顿和深化改革中达到预期的目标。
    今天，２７６８位代表肩负着全国各族人民的嘱托，聚集在万人礼堂，共商国家大计。
    大会主席团的１８位常务主席同赵紫阳、杨尚昆、李鹏、李先念、乔石、胡启立、姚依林、王震及主席团其他成员一起，到主席台就座时，会场响起热烈掌声。
    下午３时，大会执行主席、主席团常务主席万里宣布大会开幕。全场起立，军乐团高奏国歌。
    李鹏总理在热烈的掌声中走到讲台前，向大会作政府工作报告。他的报告约两万五千字，分８个部分：一心一意进行治理整顿；当前治理整顿的重点仍然是压缩社会需求；认真整顿经济秩序特别是流通秩序；在治理整顿中认真调整经济结构；在治理整顿中确保科技教育的发展；把治理整顿同深化改革密切结合起来；在治理整顿中积极发展对外开放；努力创造良好的稳定的社会政治环境。李鹏在报告中还谈了祖国统一问题和外交工作。
    李鹏说，刚刚过去的１９８８年，是我国社会主义现代化事业继续向前发展的一年。
    他说，我们在各项工作取得成绩的同时，面临的问题和困难也不少，最突出的是出现了明显的通货膨胀，物价上涨幅度过大。
    李鹏指出，上述情况的产生，是同新旧体制转换时期还不可能很快形成一套自我调节、自我约束的新机制分不开的。但与此同时，我们在对工作的指导上也有缺点和失误。总的来看，在经济建设和社会发展中，存在着急于求成的倾向。
    李鹏接着谈到半年来的治理整顿在压缩固定资产投资规模、控制信贷规模、增加储蓄和稳定金融、压缩社会集团购买力，开展全国性的财务、税收、物价大检查，整顿流通领域的秩序，增加有效供给等方面取得的初步成效。他说，经过半年来的工作，经济过热开始降温，物价上涨势头有所减弱，群众对物价的紧张心理有所缓和，城乡市场基本稳定。
    李鹏指出，对半年来的治理整顿，应该作两点基本估计：第一，事实证明，中共中央、国务院确定的治理整顿的方针政策和措施是正确的。第二，已经取得的成效仅仅是初步的，同治理整顿所要达到的目标还有很大的差距。我们只能知难而进，决不能半途而废。
    李鹏总理作报告过程中，会场里多次响起热烈掌声。
    今天大会的执行主席由主席团常务主席担任，他们是：习仲勋、彭冲、韦国清、朱学范、阿沛·阿旺晋美、赛福鼎·艾则孜、周谷城、严济慈、荣毅仁、叶飞、廖汉生、倪志福、陈慕华、费孝通、孙起孟、雷洁琼、王汉斌。
    在主席台上就座的还有党和国家其他领导人以及其他方面负责人李铁映、李瑞环、李锡铭、吴学谦、胡耀邦、秦基伟、丁关根、宋任穷、芮杏文、温家宝、王丙乾、宋健、王芳、李贵鲜、陈希同、陈俊生、任建新、刘复之、王任重、方毅、谷牧、杨静仁、康克清、帕巴拉·格列朗杰、王光英、邓兆祥、赵朴初、屈武、马文瑞、刘靖基、王恩茂、钱学森、钱伟长、胡绳、孙晓村、程思远、卢嘉锡、钱正英、苏步青、司马义·艾买提、洪学智、刘华清等。
