The Chair is Not Cast in Steel: Workers Dismiss an Incompetent Manager

    A factory manager in Chengdu was dismissed by workers. The former manager of Chengdu Plastic Factory No. 2, Zhang Daoshu, severely neglected his duties in the introduction of new projects, causing the factory to suffer economic losses of over 600,000 yuan. Recently, the factory's workers' congress discussed and passed a resolution to dismiss Zhang, which was approved by the relevant authorities.

At the age of seven, she stopped eating after her mother's death. Now, she is 1.3 meters tall, weighs 30 kilograms, and runs a fruit stall in the village.
