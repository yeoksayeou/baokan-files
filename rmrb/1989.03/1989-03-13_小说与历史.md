I enjoy reading history books. The ancients said, “Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” This saying is full of wisdom. Because by reading history books, not only can one measure today's situation, but one can also gain new lessons from it, opening up another path of thought for the reader. Official history books are inevitably dry and dull. To write in a vivid and lively manner, bringing the past to life on paper, perhaps only Sima Qian's “Records of the Grand Historian” can achieve this. Some of his biographies and annals can almost be read as exquisite short stories; this is not just my personal feeling, but many who have read the “Records of the Grand Historian” share the same sentiment. Using ancient historical facts to embellish and pass down classical literary works, one can probably say that only “Romance of the Three Kingdoms” exists. The historical facts are based on historical records, but the author's creativity is also fully displayed. This is why the book has lasted for hundreds of years and is still enjoyed by readers today. I believe this is inseparable from the author's rich imagination.

In the 1930s, many predecessors such as Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Zheng Zhenqiao, and Shi Zhiqian wrote some short historical novels, but soon the Anti-Japanese War broke out, and this work was halted. Therefore, when I read the recently published first volume of Zhou Ruofu's “Long River Ten Thousand Miles Map,” titled “The Fall of Nanjing,” I couldn't help but admire the author's boldness in choosing such a grand historical theme for a novel.

In our country's history, it has mostly been struggles between ethnic groups. It was only from the mid-Qing Dynasty that foreign imperialists invaded, and the largest scale of this was the 1938 to 1945 eight-year Sino-Japanese War. “The Fall of Nanjing” is a story from the early days of the war of resistance, depicting the period when the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek was forced to form a second united front with the Communist Party of China to resist the Japanese imperialists, until the fall of Nanjing and the Nanjing Massacre by the Japanese invaders. It depicts both the “Low Tone Club” of Wang Jingwei and others who opposed the war of resistance, and Chiang Kai-shek's half-hearted and stubborn nature, missing the opportunity to annihilate the Japanese imperialists' forces on the Shanghai front. It especially depicts the national unity and the brave fighting of the frontline soldiers. On one hand, there is a desire for peace and survival, and on the other, there is a righteous spirit that touches the heavens and moves the ghosts. The contrast between these two states has a certain educational value for those who experienced it and for later generations in evaluating history and discussing merits and demerits. Of course, the author could not have experienced everything firsthand, but a rich and vivid imagination can make readers read this novel as if it were a true historical account.

I experienced these eight years of war of resistance, and especially the “8·13” Battle of Shanghai, I lived in the foreign concession in Shanghai, right at the doorstep of the battlefield. I still keep a photo of the great fire in Zhabei when our troops retreated from Shanghai, which I took from the roof of a house in the French concession, facing the sky full of smoke. To this day, looking at this photo still reminds me of the mood at that time; a heart full of indignation, but not a hint of despair. This mood was the spiritual power given to people by the Communist Party of China's call for national resistance, which was precisely the crucial moment when China's traditional culture was destroyed and new cultural qualities emerged from the ruins. “The Fall of Nanjing” recorded the Chinese people's will that moved heaven and earth and made ghosts weep.

Revisiting the past half-century of history has an invaluable significance for our present day. Haven't we seen in the news that Japanese right-wing thugs were sentenced for damaging the Sino-Japanese Peace Memorial? These remnants of militarism have not given up yet. However, seeing the emergence of a certain blind “Japan fever” among Chinese youth, one cannot help but feel anxious.

　　小说与历史
    冯亦代
    我喜欢读历史书。古人说“前事不忘，后事之师”，这句话就饱含着哲理。因为读了历史书，不但可以衡量今日的情景，还可以从中得到新的教训，开启读书人的另一种思路。正式的史书不免有枯燥乏味之嫌，要写得生龙活虎在纸上重现当时情景的，恐怕只有一个司马迁写的《史记》。他写的一些本纪与列传，简直可以当精湛的短篇小说读；这不是我个人的体会，读过《史记》而与我有同感的并不乏人。以古史实来加以渲染而至今传下来的古典文学作品，大概可以说只有《三国演义》一部，史实依史书所载，而从中又发挥了作者的创造，这部书所以能历数百年而至今还为读者所乐道，我想这和作者的丰富想象力是分不开的。
    ３０年代中，不少前辈如鲁迅、茅盾、郑振铎、施蛰存等人写了些短篇历史小说，但不久抗战军兴，这工作也就停止了。因此当我读了最近出版周而复的《长江万里图》第一卷《南京的陷落》后，禁不住对作者挑选了这个宏大历史题目写小说的气魄感到佩服。　　
    我国历史上大都是兄弟民族间的斗争，自清代中叶以来才有外来帝国主义者的入侵，其间规模最大的一次，便是１９３８年到１９４５年的８年中日战争。《南京的陷落》是抗战初期的故事，写到了国民党蒋介石被迫与中国共产党结成第二次统一战线，起而对日帝进行抗战，直到南京陷落，日寇在南京的大屠杀为止。这里面既写到了汪精卫等人反对抗战的“低调俱乐部”，也写了蒋介石的半心半意与刚愎自用，坐失在上海前线歼灭日帝有生力量的良机；特别写到了全国人民的同仇敌忾与前线将士的英勇奋战。一面是苟安偷生，一面是义薄云天。两种境界的对比，对身历其境者和后来人评价历史、论述功过，都有一定的教益。当然作者不可能事事亲历其境，但丰富生动的想象力，却可以使读者把这部小说当信史来读。
    我是经历了这８年抗战的，特别“８·１３”上海之战，我就住在战场的大门口上海的外国租界里。我至今还保留着一帧上海我军撤退时闸北大火的照片，这是我从法租界一所房屋的房顶对着弥天的烟云拍摄下来的。至今我看了这帧照片还能记得当时的心情；一腔悲愤，但是没有一点颓唐心态。这种心情就是中国共产党号召全民抗战所给人们的精神力量，这正是中国固有文化遭受破坏，而在废墟上重新涌现新的文化素质的紧要关头。《南京的陷落》就记下了中国人民这种动天地泣鬼神的意志。
    重新回头去温习一下快半个世纪的往事，对我们的今日有珍贵万分的价值。报上不是有日本右翼歹徒因破坏中日和平纪念碑而被判刑的消息吗？这些军国主义的余孽至今还没死心。但是眼看着中国青年中出现某种盲目的“日本热”，又不能不令人心有惶惑。
