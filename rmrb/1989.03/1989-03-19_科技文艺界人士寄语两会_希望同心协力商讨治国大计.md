Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 18th.

Scientists and artists attending the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress and the Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference expressed their hopes today during interviews with reporters. They hope that this year's two sessions will be a conference that boosts morale and builds confidence, a conference that fosters unity and discusses the governance of the country. They hope that representatives and members will work together to make the two sessions a success.

Wu Jiaping, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society and Vice Chairman of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, believes that the most important thing now is for the whole nation to unite and work together to carry out the rectification and deepen the reform, so that our country can move forward more quickly on the road to revitalization.

Wang Ganchang, a nuclear physicist and former Vice Chairman of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, said he hopes the two sessions will yield practical results and that the decisions made will be implemented consistently from top to bottom. He believes that the ten years of reform and construction in our country have generally developed in a positive direction, but there are also some unsatisfactory phenomena. For example, many cars on the streets are foreign-made, and many cigarettes and cosmetics are imported using foreign exchange. The policy of self-reliance and frugal construction has not been well implemented, and so on.

Gu Zhiwei, a researcher at the Institute of Geology and Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that although the country's economy is facing some difficulties, we must continue to adhere to the policy of reform and opening up, especially to respect knowledge and respect talents.

Liu Yuanzhang, Chairman of the Asia-Pacific Quality Management Association, spoke about the upcoming two sessions, saying that he will not only propose suggestions related to product quality management but also propose suggestions on major issues outside his expertise.

Wang Dezhao, Honorary Director of the Institute of Acoustics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is 84 years old, told reporters: "I hope these two conferences will be successful, to inspire scientists and the people of the whole country. Once we have a common understanding, we can overcome difficulties. Although the country is facing difficulties, it is much better than before. The achievements of the ten years of reform are obvious to all."

Lin Lanying, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, hopes that through the two sessions, better supporting measures can be formulated to implement the various policies and guidelines set by the central government.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 18th.

More than ten well-known figures from the literary and artistic circles attending the Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference gathered at the Jingfeng Hotel this afternoon to discuss how to successfully hold this session of the Political Consultative Conference and how to promote the development of literature and art.

Zhou Xiaoyan, Zhang Ruifang, Fang Jufen, and Xin Fengxia, among others, spoke and believed that the central government's opinions on promoting literature and art reflect the central government's concern for the literary and artistic circles. Peking Opera performer Yuan Shihai said that after reading the central government's opinions, he was very inspired and excited. He expressed his willingness to contribute his remaining strength to the development of literature and art without reservation.

Luo Yuzheng, Chairman of the China Quyi Artists Association, commented on some vulgar phenomena that have appeared in the literary and artistic circles. She believed that whether literature and art can be revitalized and further developed depends on whether people in the literary and artistic circles can fully exert their subjective initiative and produce good works.

Playwright Wu Zulu said that the central government's document was carefully drafted, taking into account various opinions. He said that the mistakes made in the past were due to the interference of the ultra-left line. Since the ultra-left line has been criticized, literature and art have flourished.

Zhou Weizhi said that our slogan should be: boost morale and build confidence. Boost that spirit of facing reality and forging ahead; build that confidence of overcoming difficulties and pressing forward.

Huajunwu, Huang Miaozhi, Li Huanzhi, Ye Qianyu, Hu Xiqing, and others also spoke at the meeting.

　　科技文艺界人士寄语两会
    希望同心协力商讨治国大计
    据新华社北京３月１８日电  出席七届全国人大二次会议和全国政协七届二次会议的部分代表、委员今天接受记者采访时，希望今年的两会开成振奋精神、提高信心的大会，开成团结一致，商讨搞好治理整顿和深化改革的大会，希望代表和委员们同心协力把两会开好。
    九三学社中央副主席、中国科协副主席吴阶平代表认为，现在最要紧的是举国上下要团结一致，把治理整顿、深化改革搞好，使我们的国家能更快地在振兴的道路上前进。
    核物理专家、原中国科协副主席王淦昌说，希望两会能有一个实际的结果，会后能够上下一致地贯彻执行两会的决议。他认为，我国十年改革和建设总的来看是朝较好的方向发展，但也有一些现象不太令人满意。如，大街上跑的多是外国的汽车，不少香烟、化妆品都是用外汇从国外进口的，自力更生、勤俭建国的方针没能得到很好的贯彻等等。
    中国科学院地质古生物研究所研究员顾知微委员说，现在国家经济生活中遇到了一些困难，但我们仍要坚持改革、开放的方针，特别要尊重知识、尊重人才。
    亚太地区质量管理协会主席刘源张谈到即将召开的两会说，他既要提出有关产品质量管理方面的建议，也要对专长以外的一些重大问题提出建议。
    ８４岁高龄的中国科学院声学所名誉所长汪德昭委员对记者说：“我希望这两个会议开好，以鼓舞科技界人士和全国人民。大家认识一致了，就能克服困难。现在国家有困难，但比过去好多了。十年改革成就是有目共睹的。”
    中国科协副主席林兰英希望能够通过两会，帮助制定出比较好的配套措施，把中央制定的各项方针政策落到实处。
    据新华社北京３月１８日电　出席全国政协七届二次会议的十多名文艺界知名人士今天下午聚会京丰宾馆，就如何开好这次政协会议和繁荣文艺问题进行了热烈讨论。
    周小燕、张瑞芳、方掬芬、新凤霞等委员在发言中认为，中央关于繁荣文艺的若干意见体现了中央对文艺界的关心。京剧表演艺术家袁世海说，读了中央的意见，很受鼓舞，非常兴奋。他表示要毫无保留地为繁荣文艺贡献余热。
    中国曲艺家协会主席骆玉笙对文艺界出现的一些庸俗化现象提出了看法。她认为，能不能振兴和进一步繁荣文艺，关键在于文艺圈里的人能不能充分发挥自己的主观能动性，拿出好的作品来。
    剧作家吴祖光说，中央的这个文件在起草过程中很认真地听取了各方面的意见。他说，过去发生的失误都是由于极左路线的干扰造成的，极左路线受到了批判，文艺也就繁荣了。
    周巍峙说，我们的口号应该是：振奋精神，增强信心。振奋那种正视现实，开拓前进的精神；增强那种克服困难，一往无前的信心。
    华君武、黄苗子、李焕之、叶浅予、胡絜青等委员，也先后在座谈会上发言。
