The primary function of a pill bottle cap is likely to protect the medicine inside from moisture, dryness, light, dust, and other contaminants, ensuring that the medicine's efficacy remains unchanged over a certain period. Some people have imagined giving it more functions, such as the ancient Greek myths and Indian legends where a small bottle cap seals a powerful sea demon. But that is merely a "thousand and one nights" tale.

With the advancement of science and technology, modern people have developed a type of pill bottle cap that can record medication information and aid in medical treatment.

According to foreign news reports, a company in California, USA, specializing in micro-packaging electronic technology, has recently launched a "medication monitoring device" — a magical pill bottle cap. It can automatically record the time the bottle is opened, the amount of medication taken, the duration the bottle is left open, and the time the bottle is closed. This cap, though remarkable, is not magical. It simply has a "micro information processing machine" installed on the bottle cap. The microcomputer records the medication details on a "medication card." When patients return for follow-up visits, they must hand over this cap to the doctor. Medical professionals connect the cap to the computer terminal, and the screen immediately displays the entire medication process. Doctors use this information for follow-up consultations, significantly improving treatment effectiveness. This is one of its functions.

More importantly, this cap can remind patients to take their medication on time and in the correct dosage. This is particularly beneficial for those who are lazy about taking medication, wasteful, or frequently make mistakes with their medication.

According to an official report from the United States, among long-term medication users, 45% of patients do not follow the doctor's instructions and take medication recklessly, with 5% of these cases endangering their lives. Additionally, 55% of patients' medication details are unknown. To address this, the authorities have repeatedly emphasized the importance of proper medication use and have made significant efforts to improve measures. The "micro medication automatic information processing device" is one of the standout solutions. Upon its release, it immediately garnered high attention from the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Some experts have hailed this magical pill bottle cap as "a revolution in pill bottle caps!"

　　神奇的药瓶盖

    保护瓶中药物不受潮、燥、光、尘等污染，保持瓶中药的药性、功效在一定时间内不减弱，这大概是药瓶盖子诞生以来的“千年一贯制”用途吧？也有人幻想赋于它更多更大的功能，诸如古希腊神话和古印度传说中都曾有过一个小小瓶盖把一个海中魔力无边的恶鬼巨妖盖住的故事，但那终究只是“天方夜谭”罢了。
    随着科学技术的发展，当代人已研制出一种能记录服药信息，帮助医疗的神奇药瓶盖子。
    据外电报道，美国加利福尼亚州有家开发微型包装电子技术的公司，目前推出了一种被称为“服药监视装置”的神奇药瓶子。它能自动记录下人们开瓶时间、取药数量、敞瓶时间、盖瓶时间。此盖虽奇而不神。只是在瓶子盖上安装了一个“超微型信息处理机”。“微机”把服药情况记载在“服药卡”上。病友复诊时，必须将此盖一并交给大夫。医务工作者把这盖子连到电脑的终端上，屏幕上立即会再现出服药全过程。医生据此复诊，极大地提高了疗效。这是它的功劳之一。
    更重要的是，此盖可以提醒病友按时按量及时服药。这对懒于服用者，对浪费者，尤其是对服药常失误者大有教益。
    据美国官方一份调查材料：在长期服药的人中，竟有百分之四十五的患者不能遵医嘱，胡乱服用，危及生命的高达百分之五左右！另外百分之五十五的病友服药详情不得而知。为此，当局不仅一再大声疾呼，还在改进措施上颇动了一番心计，“微型服药自动信息处理装置”就是其中佼佼者。它一问世，立即引起医药界高度重视，一些专家把这种神奇的药瓶盖子誉为“药瓶盖子上的一场革命”！
