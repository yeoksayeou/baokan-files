China Disabled Persons' Federation, Beijing, March 16th.

The China Disabled Persons' Federation today submitted a proposal to the Party Central Committee, the National People's Congress, and the State Council, stating that among the current 51.64 million disabled persons in China, 20% are congenitally disabled.

The federation's proposal expresses concern that China sees 380,000 births with defects each year. In some places, the birth rate of defective children is 3.2% of the newly married population. This not only brings pain to the disabled but also misfortune to families and a burden to the state. The federation urges the government and society to further strengthen the prevention of disabilities and reduce the number of defective births. It suggests the early promulgation of a eugenics law, the prohibition of marriages between close relatives, the prevention and treatment of endemic diseases, environmental protection, control of pollution and public hazards, and the strengthening of scientific research related to eugenics.

Meanwhile, Wang Zhen, Vice Chairman of the State, today accepted the invitation from the China Disabled Persons' Federation to serve as its honorary chairman with a smile.

Wang Zhen said at his inauguration as honorary chairman of the China Disabled Persons' Federation, "The cause of the disabled is a humanitarian, progressive, and noble cause. I am willing to work with everyone to advance this cause."

It is understood that the State Council has clearly designated Vice Premier Chen Junsheng to oversee the work related to the disabled.

　　中国残联建议优生立法
    王震出任残联名誉主席
    陈俊生分管残疾人工作
    本报北京３月１６日讯  记者罗同松报道：中国残疾人联合会今天向党中央、全国人大、国务院提交的建议书中说，在我国目前的５１６４万残疾人中，先天致残者占２０％。
    中国残联的建议书忧虑地说，我国每年出生有缺陷儿３８万。有的地方缺陷儿出生率是新婚人口的３．２％。这不仅给残疾人带来了痛苦，而且给家庭带来了不幸，给国家带来了负担。中国残联吁请政府、社会进一步加强残疾预防，减少缺陷儿出生。建议尽早颁布优生法，禁止近亲结婚，防治地方病，保护环境，控制污染和公害，加强有关优生的科学研究。
    又讯　国家副主席王震今天笑容满面地接受了中国残疾人联合会邀请他出任该会名誉主席的聘请。
    王震就任中国残联名誉主席时说，残疾人事业是人道的事业，进步的事业，高尚的事业。我愿和大家推进这一事业。
    据悉，国务院已明确由国务委员陈俊生分管残疾人工作。
