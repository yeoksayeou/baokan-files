**On China's Foreign Policy and Related International Issues: Qian Qichen Answers Questions from Chinese and Foreign Journalists**

**Reported by Zhu Weiqun and Wang Jin**

On March 27th, the spokesperson for the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, Yao Guang, held a press conference inviting Foreign Minister Qian Qichen to answer questions from Chinese and foreign journalists regarding China's foreign policy and related international issues.

**The Sino-Soviet Summit Will End the Past and Open the Future**

Qian Qichen, in response to questions from Japanese, Soviet, and Hong Kong journalists about the Sino-Soviet summit, said: The Sino-Soviet summit itself is of great significance because it is conducive to maintaining peace in Asia and the world. Its importance does not lie in signing or not signing any documents. The leaders of the two countries will hold talks on the normalization of relations between the two countries, ending the past and opening the future. Regarding the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, we have proposed to remove three obstacles. Although some progress has been made, the obstacles have not yet been completely removed. The Cambodian issue will still be an important issue for both sides to discuss. It remains to be seen how the talks go, what specific actions will be taken, and what the results will be. After the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, to completely remove the obstacles, there is still a long way to go.

He said: Everyone knows that Gorbachev is visiting China at the invitation of Chairman Yang Shangkun. Therefore, this is a talk between China and the Soviet Union. However, since he is visiting, meeting with Chinese leaders, it is logical for him to meet with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. I think the differences will not be immediately resolved, because differences always exist and it is impossible to be completely consistent.

When asked by a reporter from U.S. News & World Report whether Chinese leaders think that in some aspects China should learn from the Soviet Union, Qian Qichen replied: China's situation is different from that of the Soviet Union. One "prescription" may not work. If this "prescription" is good for the Soviet Union, it is still a question whether it will be good for China. Whether it is political system reform or human rights, it is inseparable from the specific situation of each country. For example, regarding human rights, first of all, one must have food, then education, and so on. China still has 200 million illiterates. In some countries, the problem of hunger has not been solved. Is this a violation of human rights? It is a matter of development level. The United States has not joined the International Human Rights Covenant because the U.S. government says that some people believe that some provisions in the covenant conflict with some domestic laws in the United States. It can be seen that each country has its own special circumstances, and things can only be done well according to the actual situation of each country.

**The Soviet Union Should Promote Vietnam's Withdrawal from Cambodia**

When asked by a reporter from the Far Eastern Economic Review what specific efforts the Soviet Union should make regarding the Cambodian issue, Qian Qichen said: I think the Soviet Union can still play a role. Please note that Premier Li Peng mentioned in his government work report on Sino-Soviet relations: "We believe that the Soviet Union can and should continue to make positive efforts to promote Vietnam's genuine withdrawal from Cambodia and to push for a political solution to the Cambodian issue."

He said, we support Prince Norodom Sihanouk's request for aid from the United States and other countries, and we also appreciate the aid provided by the U.S. side to Sihanouk. We believe that the international community should strengthen its support for the Cambodian resistance forces to force Vietnam to withdraw from Cambodia as soon as possible.

In response to an Australian journalist's question about whether China will send peacekeeping troops to Cambodia, Qian Qichen said: China advocates that after Vietnam withdraws, an international peacekeeping force should enter Cambodia to supervise the withdrawal and elections, and to maintain peace in Cambodia. China is not prepared to send troops to participate in this peacekeeping force. It would be most appropriate for other countries to send peacekeeping forces under the United Nations system after reaching an agreement. The current problem is that the Vietnamese authorities are firmly opposed to sending an international peacekeeping force to Cambodia. This is the crux of the matter.

**The Tibet Issue is China's Internal Affair and Not Subject to Interference**

When asked by a Spanish journalist why the European Parliament's involvement in the Tibet issue is considered interference in China's internal affairs, Qian Qichen emphasized: The Tibet issue is not a human rights issue, but an issue of some people trying to split the motherland, cause disturbances, and disrupt public order, resulting in the loss of people's lives and property. The Chinese government's actions within its territory do not require foreign parliaments to discuss. If it is regarded as a human rights issue, we believe this is interference in China's internal affairs, so we have made representations to the European Parliament. The Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress has also lodged a protest.

**“Small Actions” Are Not Conducive to Sino-U.S. Friendship**

When asked by a Voice of America reporter whether all foreign comments on China's Tibet and human rights issues are considered interference in China's internal affairs, Qian Qichen said, everyone knows that human rights are protected by law, but they are also constrained by law. If laws are violated, then legal consequences must be faced. If someone's safety is threatened, it is not allowed. Therefore, human rights are not absolute; they are protected by law but also constrained by law. The French thinker Montesquieu said, what is freedom? Freedom is a right, it is the right to do what the law allows. The incident involving Fang Lizhi is a small episode. This matter has passed, but it reflects that in the United States, there are always some people who want to support those who are dissatisfied with the Chinese government. I think taking such "small actions" is not conducive to Sino-U.S. friendship. We hope that the second decade of Sino-U.S. relations can develop smoothly, because the first decade was not very smooth. We hope that Sino-U.S. relations can develop in the new situation, with increased trust and coordinated development. I think incidents like Fang Lizhi's are also a kind of trouble. Some people in the U.S. Congress know very little about the situation in Tibet, but they have strong prejudices. If they continue to do things this way, they will inevitably interfere in China's internal affairs. For example, the U.S. Congress discussing China's population policy is itself very ridiculous. I believe that the potential for Sino-U.S. relations is great and the prospects are good, but we need to increase trust and reduce troubles.

**There is No Flexibility in the Issue of Safeguarding National Unity**

When asked about the evaluation of the so-called "flexible diplomacy" of the Taiwan authorities, Qian Qichen said: The term "flexible diplomacy" is a new one. My interpretation of this term is: using economic and trade relations to propose political conditions, creating "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan." Such "flexible diplomacy" not only violates the claim of the Kuomintang authorities that there is only one China but also goes against the wishes of all Chinese people to unite the motherland. The Taiwan authorities should recognize the situation and take a very firm and clear attitude on the issue of one China and national reunification. There is no such thing as "flexibility." In response to a question from the Taiwan Independent Evening News, Qian Qichen said: We have no objection to the development of economic and trade relations between the Taiwan region and other countries, but official relations and diplomatic relations cannot be developed, creating "one China, one Taiwan." Because doing so goes against the interests of all Chinese people. As for the economic and trade law with Taiwan that the Philippines wants to pass, it violates the Sino-Philippines Joint Communiqué and President Aquino's Order No. 313.

**Developing Sino-Japanese Relations on the Basis of the Sino-Japanese Joint Communiqué**

When discussing Premier Li Peng's upcoming visit to Japan and Sino-Japanese relations, Qian Qichen said, Premier Li Peng's visit to Japan is a return visit to Prime Minister Takeshita's visit to China last year. The two sides will hold talks on a wide range of international issues and bilateral relations. Premier Li Peng will have extensive contacts with various sectors of Japanese society and exchange views on how to maintain the stable development of Sino-Japanese relations and strengthen Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. I believe this visit will be successful. Overall, Sino-Japanese relations are developing steadily, but there are often some problems. One is the nature of the past war, where some people want to deny or downplay it. The other is that there are often actions that violate the Sino-Japanese Joint Communiqué on the Taiwan issue. These two issues are problems that need to be constantly guarded against and prevented in Sino-Japanese relations.

**China Will Not Change Its Policy Towards African Countries**

When asked by a reporter from Time magazine about the recent disturbances involving African students in some Chinese cities and whether China plans to reconsider its policy towards Africa, Qian Qichen replied: I think the problem that occurred recently is a "campus security incident," and it is also a problem between young people. This problem can be solved through education. We can understand that African students in China feel lonely and are unfamiliar with the place. On the other hand, young people are easily emotional, and it is not objective to say that this incident is racial discrimination. In fact, China does not have racial discrimination. The method to solve this problem is that education should be conducted, and the school authorities should patiently educate both Chinese and African students. Let young people know what is right and what is wrong. China has no need to change its policy towards African countries, whether in promoting cultural exchanges, accepting students, or supporting the African people's struggle to maintain national sovereignty, there has been no change.

**The Security of the Asia-Pacific Region Cannot Be Copied from the European Model**

When asked by a Hungarian journalist whether China considers establishing a similar collective security mechanism in the Asia-Pacific region, Qian Qichen replied, I think the situation in Europe and Asia is very different. Whether it is Eastern Europe or Western Europe, they are relatively developed, with two military blocs facing each other. However, in the Asia-Pacific region, the level of development, political and social systems, and cultural and historical backgrounds are very different. At the same time, there are no two military blocs there, so I think it is not appropriate to establish an Asian military system according to the European model.

**China and Indonesia Are About to Resume Diplomatic Relations**

When asked about the recent meeting in Tokyo between Foreign Minister Qian and the Indonesian President and State Minister, and the decision to take further measures to normalize relations between the two countries, Qian Qichen said, after meeting with the Indonesian President in Tokyo, the political issues regarding the resumption of diplomatic relations with Indonesia have been resolved, and the remaining technical issues need to be discussed.

**It Depends on the British Side Who Among the Hong Kong People Will Obtain British Residency**

When asked by a Hong Kong journalist about the statement by a British Foreign Office official that if Hong Kong-born Chinese obtain British residency, it would violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Qian Qichen said, regarding the issue of Hong Kong people obtaining British nationality, the Joint Declaration states who can and who cannot. This is a matter for the British. The British side does not want many Hong Kong residents to obtain British residency.

### 就我国对外政策和有关国际问题  钱其琛答中外记者问

　　就我国对外政策和有关国际问题        
    钱其琛答中外记者问
    本报北京３月２７日讯  记者朱维群、王谨报道：七届人大二次会议新闻发言人姚广今天下午举行中外记者招待会，邀请外交部长钱其琛就我国的对外政策和有关国际问题，回答中外记者的提问。
    　　　　中苏首脑会晤将结束过去开辟未来
    钱其琛在回答日本、苏联和香港记者有关中苏首脑会晤问题时说：中苏首脑会晤本身就具有重要意义，因为它有利于维护亚洲和世界和平。它的重要性不在于签署不签署什么文件。两国领导人将就两国关系正常化进行会谈，结束过去，开辟未来。关于中苏关系正常化我们提出要消除三个障碍，虽然已做了一些事，取得一定进展，但是还不能说障碍已经消除。柬埔寨问题仍将是双方要讨论的重要问题，还要看谈得怎样，要看有什么具体行动，要看有什么结果。中苏关系正常化以后要完全消除障碍，还有一段路要走。
    他说：大家知道戈尔巴乔夫是应杨尚昆主席的邀请来华访问的。所以这是中苏两国之间的会谈。但是既然来访问，会见中国领导人，那么他同赵紫阳总书记的会见是合乎逻辑的。我想会见后分歧不会马上消除，因为分歧是始终存在的，不可能完全一致的。
    美国新闻周刊记者提问：许多分析家说苏联在政治体制改革方面比中国快，最近还实行了真正的差额选举。中国领导人是否认为在某些方面中国应向苏联学习？
    钱其琛回答：中国的情况和苏联情况不同。用一种“方子”恐怕不行。如果这个“方子”对苏联很好，但用到中国来到底好不好也是个问题。政治体制改革也好，人权也好，都和每个国家的具体情况分不开，比如说人权，首先要吃饭，其次要受教育，等等。中国的文盲还有两亿，在有些国家饥饿问题没有解决，是违犯人权吗？是发展程度不够。美国也没有参加国际人权公约，因为美国政府说有些人认为这些公约里的有些规定和美国有些国内法律相抵触。由此可见，每个国家都有自己的特殊情况，根据每个国家的实际情况事情才能办好。
    　　　　苏联应促使越南从柬埔寨撤军
    当《远东经济评论》记者问苏联在柬埔寨问题上还应做出哪些具体努力时，钱其琛说：我想，苏联还是能够起作用的。请大家注意，李鹏总理在政府工作报告中谈到中苏关系时说：“我们认为，苏联在促使越南从柬埔寨真正撤军、推动政治解决柬埔寨问题上，能够而且有责任继续作出积极努力。”
    他说，我们支持西哈努克亲王要求美国和其他一些国家提供援助，也赞赏美国方面对西哈努克所提供的援助。我们认为国际社会应加强对柬埔寨抵抗力量的援助，以便迫使越南早日从柬埔寨撤军。
    在回答澳大利亚记者关于中国是否将派维持和平部队进驻柬埔寨时，钱其琛说：中国主张在越南撤军之后由国际维持和平部队进入柬埔寨监督撤军和大选、保持柬埔寨的和平。中国不准备派军队参加这个维持和平部队。其他国家派遣维持和平部队当然应在达成协议之后，以联合国系统派遣最为合适。现在的问题是越南当局坚决反对派遣国际维持和平部队到柬埔寨。这是问题的症结。
    　　　　西藏问题是中国内政不容干涉
    西班牙记者提问：为什么说欧洲议会在西藏问题上是干涉中国内政？钱其琛强调指出：西藏问题不是人权问题，而是一些人分裂祖国、制造骚动、破坏公共秩序，造成人民生命财产损失问题。中国政府在领土范围内执行主权行动，不需要外国议会讨论。如果看成是人权问题，我们认为这是对中国内政的干涉，所以向欧洲议会提出交涉。全国人大外事委员会也提出抗议。
    　　　　“小动作”不利于中美友谊
    美国之音记者问：是不是说所有外国对中国西藏和人权问题进行评论，都被认为是对中国内政的干涉？布什总统来中国的时候没有提到人权问题，但是赵紫阳总书记却上了一场很严厉的中国人权的课，尤其是中国警察阻止方励之出席布什总统的宴会，这样对待是否合适？这样是否给中美关系带来紧张？
    钱其琛说，谁都知道人权是受法律保护的，同时也是受法律制约的。如果说违犯了法律，那么就必须受到法律的追究，如果破坏别人的安全，也是不允许的。所以说人权不是绝对的，是受到法律的保护，又要受到法律的制约。法国思想家孟德斯鸠说，什么是自由？自由就是一种权利，就是去做法律所允许的事情。方励之事件是一个小插曲，这件事已经过去了，但反映了在美国总是有一些人想支持对中国政府不满的人。我看采取这样的“小动作”是不利于中美友谊的。我们希望第二个十年的中美关系能够顺利地发展，因为第一个十年发展得不是很顺利。希望中美关系能够在新的格局下向前发展，两国之间应该增加信任，协调发展。我看像方励之这种事也算是一种麻烦吧？！美国国会的某些人对西藏情况知道得很少，但偏见非常强，照这样办法干下去，必然会干涉中国内政。又比如美国国会讨论中国的人口政策，这件事的本身就非常可笑。我认为中美关系潜力是很大的，前景是良好的，但是需要增强信任，减少麻烦。（⑴⑵）
    　　　　在维护祖国统一问题上没有“弹性”可言
    有记者问，对台湾当局的所谓“弹性外交”作何评价？钱其琛说：所谓“弹性外交”是个新名词。我对这个名词的解释是：利用经济贸易关系来提出政治条件，制造“两个中国”或“一中一台”。这样一种“弹性外交”不仅违反了国民党当局宣称的只有一个中国的主张，而且违背所有中国人统一祖国的心愿。台湾当局应当认清形势，在一个中国和祖国统一的问题上，应当采取非常坚定明确的态度，没有什么所谓“弹性”可言。在回答台湾《自立晚报》记者提问时，钱其琛说：我们对台湾地区和其他国家发展经济贸易关系不持异议，但是，不能发展官方关系、外交关系，造成“一中一台”。因为这样做违背了所有中国人的利益。至于菲律宾所要通过的对台经济贸易法，是违背中菲建交公告的、违背阿基诺总统３１３号政令的。
    　　　　在中日建交联合声明基础上发展两国关系
    在谈到李鹏总理即将访问日本和中日关系问题时，钱其琛说，李鹏总理访日是对去年竹下登总理访华的回访。中日双方将就广泛的国际问题和双边关系问题进行会谈。李鹏总理将广泛接触日本各界人士，就如何保持中日关系稳定发展、加强中日经济合作交换意见。我相信这次访问会取得成功。中日关系总的来讲在稳步发展，但是也经常出现一些问题。一个是对过去这场战争的性质，有些人想否定或减轻。另外是在台湾问题上经常出现违背中日声明的作法。这两方面问题是中日关系中时刻需要警惕和加以防止的。
    　　　　中国不改变对非洲国家政策
    美国时代周刊记者问：最近在中国一些城市出现非洲学生骚乱的问题。一些非洲学生声言在中国遭到种族歧视而自愿离开中国。中国毕竟是一个发展中国家，过去不断给非洲一些援助。中国是否打算重新考虑对非洲的政策？
    钱其琛回答：我认为前一段发生的问题是“校园里的治安事件”，也是年青人之间发生的一些问题。对这个问题是可以用教育的方法来解决的。我们对非洲来的留学生在中国感到寂寞、人地生疏可以理解。但是另一方面，年青人容易动感情，把这件事说成种族歧视不是实事求是的。实际上中国是不存在种族歧视的。解决这个问题的方法，就是应该教育，学校当局对中国学生、非洲学生都应该进行耐心教育。让青年人知道怎样做是对的，怎样做是不对的，中国没有必要修改对非洲的国家政策，无论是在促进文化交流方面，接受留学生方面，还是支持非洲人民维护国家主权的斗争方面，都没有改变。
    　　　　亚太的安全不能照搬欧洲模式
    匈牙利记者问，目前在欧洲大陆，无论是东欧还是西欧，都认为集体安全机制是成功的办法，中国是否考虑在亚太地区建立类似的集体安全机制？
    钱其琛回答说，我想欧洲的情况和亚洲的情况差别很大。欧洲无论是东欧、西欧都是比较发达的，有两个军团对峙。但是在亚太地区发达的程度、政治社会制度、文化历史的背景差别非常大。同时没有两个军事集团在那儿，所以按照欧洲的模式建立亚洲的军事体系我认为不合适。
    　　　　中国和印尼恢复外交关系在即
    有记者问，不久前钱外长在日本东京同印度尼西亚总统和国务部长会谈，双方决定进一步采取措施实现两国关系正常化。请问中印尼关系有什么新的进展，前景如何？
    钱其琛说，我在东京会见印尼总统以后，同印尼恢复外交关系的问题政治上的问题已经解决，剩下的是技术上的问题还要商讨。
    　　　　香港哪些人取得英居留权取决于英方
    有香港记者问，据英国外交部官员说，香港出生的中国人如获得英国居留权，是违背中英联合声明的。对此您有什么意见？
    钱其琛说，关于香港人取得英国国籍问题，联合声明中讲到哪些人可以，哪些人不可以。这个问题是英国人的事。英国方面并不愿意很多香港居民得到英国居留权。
