Over the past half month, nearly 10,000 migrant workers from other provinces have been arriving in Haikou New Port daily.

Since the establishment of the province last year, the number of outsiders in Hainan has reached over 400,000. Among them, more than 100,000 have stayed in Haikou City, accounting for 40% of the permanent population. After the Spring Festival this year, another 100,000 floating population have surged into Haikou City.

Haikou City Mayor Li Jinyun appeals: The various constructions in Haikou have just begun, and there is an excess of labor on the island. We hope that all regions will assist in deterring farmers from blindly flooding into the island.

　　十万民工涌入海口希望各地予以劝阻
    本报海口３月３日电  记者罗自苏报道：近半月，每天有近万名外省盲流劳工在海口新港登陆。
    去年建省以来，海南省外来人口已达４０多万。其中，留在海口市的有１０余万，占常住人口的４０％。今年春节后，又有１０万流动人口流泻海口市。
    海口市市长李金云呼吁：海口各项建设刚刚起步，岛内劳力过剩，希望各地协助劝阻农民盲流进岛。
