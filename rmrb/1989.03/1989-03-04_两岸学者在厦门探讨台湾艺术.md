The first Taiwan Art Research Conference was held on March 1 on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen. This conference received more than 10 papers, focusing on the discussion of Taiwanese folk art and performing arts. Over 30 scholars from Beijing, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Taiwan attended the conference, including three Taiwanese musicians. They introduced the status of Taiwanese national music art and music education at the conference, shared the appreciation of Nanyin (Southern Music) with mainland scholars, exchanged materials, and discussed the development of Taiwanese art research and exchange activities between the two sides.

Before arriving in Xiamen, these Taiwanese scholars had visited Fuzhou to appreciate the performance of works by Taiwanese composers, and had also visited Quanzhou and Zhangzhou to investigate folk art.

So far, the mainland has conducted research on various types of Taiwanese art, including literature, fine arts, film and television, performing arts, and folklore. This conference was jointly organized by the Fujian Provincial Art Research Institute and the Xiamen City Taiwan Art Research Office.
