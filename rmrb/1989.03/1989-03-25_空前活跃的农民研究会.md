The Unprecedentedly Active Farmers' Research Societies

	Reported by Wang Yougong, People's Daily

		The Sudden Burst of Activity

	In China's "corn belt" of the Songnen Plain in Heilongjiang, growing corn is a specialty of the local farmers. However, due to traditional planting methods, in Zhaodong City, which has natural advantages and a long history of corn cultivation, the yield per mu of corn remained around 200 kilograms until the 1970s. With the help of county and township science associations and technical personnel, young farmer Qin Yuhai was the first to adopt new technologies and new varieties, achieving a breakthrough yield of 900 kilograms per mu on his 16 mu of contracted land. In 1984, Qin Yuhai, along with a group of large-scale farmers, established the Corn Research Society. Through unremitting efforts, Qin Yuhai's corn achieved three consecutive championships in the provincial high-yield competition, becoming one of the top 100 wealth-creation experts in the country. The members of the society also averaged a yield of 550 kilograms per mu. Following their lead, the city established more than 30 corn research societies. These societies helped more than 70,000 corn farmers in the city increase their income by more than 1,000 yuan per year. The local government also adjusted the planting layout, ensuring the priority development of corn. In 1987, the city delivered more than 400 million kilograms of corn, doubling the amount from 1985.

	According to a survey by the Science Popularization Department of the China Association for Science and Technology, since the first farmers' professional technical research society was established in Sichuan's Wenchuan region in 1980, such societies have rapidly emerged across the country. Currently, except for Tibet and Taiwan, which have not been surveyed, 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have more than 90,000 such societies. These societies cover more than 140 specialties, including planting, breeding, animal husbandry, aquaculture, processing, and local products.

		The Source of Vitality

	The new technical force of farmers that has emerged in China's vast rural areas has many characteristics distinct from ordinary scientific and technological teams.

	In terms of structure, the core members of these research societies are often the founders and initiators. They are often wealth-creation experts, skilled craftsmen, large-scale farmers, or scientific and technological demonstration households.

	These types of research societies do not ask the state for any positions or money, yet they can accomplish things that large research institutions in the city might struggle to achieve even with a lot of money. They are entirely voluntary associations of farmers, with flexible mechanisms and strong vitality. The ability to bring economic benefits to members is the source of their attraction and cohesion.

	These research societies connect thousands of households at the grassroots level and link with colleges, universities, and scientific and technological departments at the higher level, serving as "secondary transmitters" for modern scientific and technological advancements to rural areas. In 1984, when cotton production in China was at a low ebb, farmers in Hejian County, Hebei Province, established the Guohua Cotton Research Society. They established close ties with more than 20 colleges, universities, and research institutions, including Beijing Agricultural University, Hebei Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the Chinese Cotton Research Institute. Experts' new varieties were first tested here, and some universities used this area as a practice base for students. The latest technologies and information brought good economic benefits to the farmers. The society currently has more than 1,300 member households, planting cotton over 10,000 mu, with technology radiating to several surrounding counties.

		Future Directions

	Recently, at a meeting of the China Association for Science and Technology in Beijing, one of the hot topics was the new trends in the service scale and self-development of farmers' research societies across the country.

	Most farmers' research societies have developed from their initial role of disseminating technical information and services to providing comprehensive services from production to supply to sales. This has created the necessary conditions for intensive production and the development of scale economies. For example, the Egg Chicken Research Society in Longzheng Township, Hai'an County, Jiangsu Province, not only provides members with seedlings and preventive services but also handles feed processing and the purchase and sale of eggs and chickens, eliminating farmers' concerns about large-scale chicken farming and creating a good environment. Under their influence, the county's chicken farming industry has rapidly developed, forming the lively scene of "million chickens crossing the river" (to Shanghai). The "chicken economy" is of great significance in this county.

	Farmers' research societies across the country have realized through practice that forming economic entities can better promote the development of intensive production. In the suburbs of Guangzhou, Jianggao Town was the first to advocate for farmers to develop poultry farming, producing and selling on their own. However, due to technological limitations, the "old lady's chicken-raising method" had low returns. Without forming a scale economy, it could not meet market demands. Later, they established a government-run chicken farm, but due to the "iron rice bowl" system, the farm management was chaotic, resulting in severe losses. In 1985, the town science association and veterinary station initiated the establishment of a poultry farming professional technical research society, forming a commercial production union. Now they not only engage in the production and export of poultry and eggs but also operate aquaculture, vegetables, and pig farming, becoming an important "vegetable basket" base for Guangzhou. Many farmers have also become wealthy, with some becoming millionaires.

	There are different views on the future direction of farmers' research societies. Some believe that they are self-organized by farmers in response to the "technological hunger" that emerged in rural areas after the implementation of the household contract responsibility system. With the universal improvement of scientific and technological literacy in rural areas, they will complete their historical mission and "retire" gracefully. More people believe that they are a product of the rural reform process, responding to the needs of commodity production development, and have strong vitality. Some comrades, after more in-depth investigations, believe that most of the existing farmers' research societies should strengthen their ties with professional technical personnel, regard professional technical departments as their backers, and cooperate with relevant material and sales departments to enhance their vitality and momentum. In this way, as the collective economic content increases, it may be possible to develop a new path for commodity economic development based on the voluntary union of farmers.

　　空前活跃的农民研究会
    本报记者  王友恭
    　　　　勃然兴发
    在我国的“玉米带”黑龙江松嫩平原上，种玉米是农家的拿手戏。然而，囿于传统的种植方式，在具有种植玉米的天然优势和悠久历史的肇东市，直到７０年代玉米亩产仍然徘徊在２００公斤左右。青年农民秦玉海在县、乡科协和科技人员的帮助下，率先采用新技术、新品种，在自家承包的１６亩地上破天荒地使玉米亩产达到９００公斤。１９８４年，秦玉海联合一批种植大户成立了玉米研究会。通过不懈的努力，秦玉海的玉米在全省高产竞赛中创造３连冠的好成绩，成了全国百名致富能手之一，会员们的玉米也平均达到亩产５５０公斤。在他们的带动下，该市先后建立起３０多个玉米研究会。这些研究会帮助全市７万多玉米种植户年增收千元以上。当地政府也据此调整了种植布局，保证优先发展玉米。１９８７年全市交售玉米达４亿多公斤，比１９８５年翻了一番。
    据中国科协科学普及部的调查，自从１９８０年我国第一个农民专业技术研究会在四川温江地区诞生以来，迅速在全国各地出现。如今，除西藏和台湾未作统计外，全国２９个省、市、自治区已有９万多个研究会。这些研究会囊括了种植、养殖、畜牧、水产、加工、特产等１４０多个专业。
    　　　　活力所在
    我国广大农村新崛起的这支农民技术新军有许多不同于一般科技队伍的特点。
    从结构上看，研究会的核心成员多是研究会的创立者、发起者。他们多是致富能手、能工巧匠、专业大户或科技示范户。
    这类研究会不向国家要一个编制、一分钱，却能办成城里的大科研机构要花很多钱也不一定能办得好的事情。它是全凭农民自愿组合起来的，具有灵活的机制和很强的活力。能给会员们带来经济上的好处是它的吸引力和凝聚力之所在。
    这些研究所下通千家万户，上联大专院校、科技部门，是现代科学技术输往农村的“二传手”。河北省河间县农民在１９８４年我国棉花生产处于低潮时成立了国欣棉花研究会，与北京农业大学、河北省农科院、中国棉花研究所等２０多个大专院校、科研单位建立了密切的联系。专家们培育出来的新品种首先在这儿试种，一些大学把这儿作为学生的实习基地。最新的技术和信息给农民带来良好的经济效益，这个研究会目前已有会员１３００多户，植棉上万亩，技术辐射到周围好几个县。
    　　　　今后走向
    前不久在北京召开的中国科协委员会会议上，热门话题之一是各地农民研究会服务规模和自身发展呈现的新趋势。
    多数农民研究会都已从最初的技术信息传播服务发展为产、供、销一条龙服务。这就为集约化生产、发展规模经济创造了必要条件。如江苏海安县隆政乡的蛋鸡研究会不但向会员提供种苗、防疫服务，还管饲料加工和蛋、鸡的收购、销售，为农民开展大规模养鸡解除了后顾之忧，创造了良好的环境。在他们的带动下，这个县的养鸡事业迅速发展起来，形成了“百万肉鸡过大江”（运往上海）的生动局面。“鸡经济”在这个县举足轻重。
    各地农民研究会在实践中体会到形成经济实体才能更好地推动集约化生产的发展。广州郊区的江高镇，最早号召农民发展家禽饲养业，自产自销，因技术跟不上，“老太婆养鸡法”效益很低。形不成规模经济，无法适应市场的需要。继而办起官办鸡场，因吃“大锅饭”，鸡场管理混乱，结果严重亏损。１９８５年由镇科协和兽医站牵头办起养鸡专业技术研究会，形成了商品生产联合体。现在他们既开展禽、蛋的生产、出口业务，又经营水产、蔬菜、养猪，成了广州一个很重要的“菜篮子”基地。许多农民也因此致富，有的成为几十万元的富翁。
    对于农民研究会的今后走向，也有不同的看法。有的认为它是农村实行联产承包责任制后，广大农村出现“科技饥渴症”的情况下农民自发组织起来的。随着农村科技文化水平的普遍提高，它将在完成历史使命后欣然“告退”。更多的人认为它是在农村改革过程中，应商品生产发展的需要应运而生的，具有强大的生命力。还有一部分同志经过比较深入的考察之后认为，现有的多数农民研究会要加强与专业技术人员的结合，把专业科技部门作为自己的后盾，与有关物资和销售部门联合起来，以增强其活力和后劲。这样，随着集体经济含量的增加，将有可能在农民志愿联合的基础上，走出一条发展商品经济的新路。
