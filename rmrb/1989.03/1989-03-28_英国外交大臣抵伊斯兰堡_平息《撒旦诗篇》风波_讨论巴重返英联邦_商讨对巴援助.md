British Foreign Secretary Arrives in Islamabad
	Eases "Satanic Verses" Controversy, Discusses Pakistan's Return to the Commonwealth, and Talks About Aid to Pakistan

	People's Daily, Islamabad, March 27 (Reporter Ren Yu Jun) - British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe arrived in Islamabad today for a two-day official visit to Pakistan. Pakistani Foreign Minister Jacob Khan welcomed Howe at the airport.

	It is understood that Howe's visit has three main purposes: first, to discuss with this Muslim-majority country how to ease the protests in the Muslim world caused by the novel "The Satanic Verses" by British author Salman Rushdie; second, to discuss Pakistan's return to the Commonwealth; and third, to talk about Britain's aid to the new Pakistani government.

	According to reports, Howe originally planned to stay in Pakistan for three days, including a visit to the White Shawh refugee camp to deliver a speech. Before his departure, Howe announced the cancellation of this part of the schedule, thus shortening his visit to Pakistan to two days. It is also reported that during his visit, Howe will meet with the acting President of the Afghan Seven Party Alliance, Mujaddidi, in Islamabad to discuss humanitarian aid to Afghan refugees.

	After concluding his visit to Pakistan, Howe will travel to India.

　　英国外交大臣抵伊斯兰堡        
    平息《撒旦诗篇》风波　讨论巴重返英联邦　商讨对巴援助
    本报伊斯兰堡３月２７日电记者任毓骏报道：英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪今天抵伊斯兰堡对巴基斯坦进行为期两天的正式访问，巴基斯坦外交部长雅各布·汗前往机场迎接杰弗里·豪。
    据悉，杰弗里·豪此行的目的有三：其一是和巴基斯坦这个穆斯林大国商讨有关平息英籍作家拉什迪的小说《撒旦诗篇》在穆斯林世界引起的抗议浪潮；其次是讨论巴基斯坦重返英联邦问题；其三是会谈英国对巴基斯坦新政府的援助问题。
    据报道，杰弗里·豪原计划在巴基斯坦停留３天，其中有一天将去白沙瓦难民营访问并发表演讲，行前，杰弗里·豪宣布取消这一日程，因而将其对巴访问缩短为两天。另据报道，杰弗里·豪在访问期间将在伊斯兰堡会见阿富汗七党联盟临时政府总统穆贾迪迪，并讨论关于对阿富汗难民提供人道主义援助事宜。
    结束对巴基斯坦访问后，杰弗里·豪将去印度访问。
