	Petals
	I suddenly thought of the falling petals: petals of roses or lilacs, perhaps signifying the maturity of the flowers, or perhaps signifying that some beautiful thoughts of the flowers are falling into the soil...
	Some petals fall and clearly express a thought, or even a declaration: to bear fruit and within the fruit, to brew juice and produce seeds.
	When I quietly think, I suddenly feel that petals of thoughts are falling into my heart, some light blue, some light red, some pale white; some like rose petals, some like pear blossoms or poppy petals.

	Butterflies
	The beauty of butterflies, is it merely because their wings have colorful patterns? I think it is also because they can flap their wings and fly; it is also because in the flapping of their wings, a sense of life's freedom and natural existence appears, and a kind of beauty of life in nature appears.
	I suddenly thought of the bees, small wasps, and mantises in Qi Baishi's paintings; their wings have no patterns. The bees, wasps, or mantises in the paintings have another kind of beauty. This is the beauty that appears when the painter endows these insects with a certain life and imbues them with the painter's emotions.

	The Call of the Turtle Dove
	Sometimes, I hear the call of the turtle dove, at dawn or dusk. Sometimes, it seems to be two turtle doves? Sometimes, it seems to be just a lonely turtle dove? Their calls sometimes seem to echo the calls I heard in my youth in the wild woods on the outskirts of my hometown (how familiar and yet how distant this sounds today), expressing a kind of yearning, a kind of intimate call that seems to be about love. Sometimes, the calls convey a sense of joy; sometimes, they sound troubled, worried.
	I listen, I listen intently, on the balcony. Sometimes, I even put down the book I am reading. But sometimes, I also feel lonely and melancholic, because hearing the call of the turtle dove makes me think of the magpies I often saw in my youth and the hawks soaring in the sky over my hometown.
	I am grateful to the ancient, tall mango tree in the neighbor's courtyard. The calls of the turtle doves often come from the mango tree, in the morning or at dusk.

    花瓣小集

    花瓣
    我忽地想起纷纷落下的花瓣：玫瑰或是丁香的花瓣，可能意味着花朵的成熟，或且意味着花朵的某些美丽的思想纷纷落入泥土中……
    有的花瓣落下来，明确地表达一种思想、或且一种宣告：要结出果实，并在果实中酿造果汁和生出核来。
    当我安静地思考时，恍忽间，感到有思想的花瓣纷纷落到我的心灵中间，有浅蓝色的，有浅红色的，有淡白色的；有的像玫瑰的花瓣，有的像梨花或罂粟花的花瓣。
    蝴蝶
    蝴蝶的美丽，是否仅仅由于他们的翅上有彩色的图案？我想，还由于他们能够振翅飞行；还由于在振翅飞行中出现一种生命的自由自在感、出现一种自然界存在的生命的美丽。
    我忽然想起齐白石画笔下的蜜蜂、小胡蜂、螳螂；他们的翅上没有图案。画中的蜜蜂、胡蜂或者螳螂，有另外一种美丽。这便是画家给予这些昆虫以某种生命和寄托了画家的情感所出现的一种美丽。
    斑鸠的声音
    有时会闻及斑鸠的啼声，在黎明或是夕暮时分。有时是两只斑鸠？有时似乎只有孤单的一只斑鸠？它们的啼声中，有时似乎能够听到自己年青时期在故乡郊外野林间所听到的那样（这在今日听来，多么熟稔又多么辽远），传出一种渴求似的呼唤，一种好像是有关爱情的亲昵的呼唤。那啼声里，有时传出一种快乐的情绪；有时听来。感到它们心中也会有烦忧，也会有困恼。
    我听着，侧耳而听，在阳台上。这样，有时竟会放下手中所读的书。不过，有时我也会感到寂寞，惆怅。因为闻及斑鸠的啼声，不免要念及幼年时代常常见到的喜鹊和在故乡空中盘旋的苍鹰。
    我感谢邻居院中的一棵古老的、高大的芒果树。斑鸠们的呼唤声时时从芒果树间传来，在早晨或在夕暮时分。
