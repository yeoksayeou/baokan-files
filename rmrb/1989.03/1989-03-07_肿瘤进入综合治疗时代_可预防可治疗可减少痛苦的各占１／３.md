The Era of Comprehensive Cancer Treatment Has Arrived
One-Third Can Be Prevented, One-Third Can Be Treated, and One-Third Can Have Pain Reduced

	Beijing, March 6 (Xinhua) — Reporter Ai Xiao: Experts from the Chinese Cancer Research Foundation revealed today at an academic event introducing new anti-cancer drugs that in the 1980s, the development of anti-cancer drugs has been rapid, bringing cancer treatment into the era of comprehensive treatment. China has made significant achievements in this regard.

	In recent years, approximately 6 million people worldwide are diagnosed with cancer each year, and 5 million die from it. The incidence rate of cancer in China is on the rise, with about 1 million new cases each year, and 800,000 lives are claimed by cancer cells.

	The World Health Organization points out that one-third of cancers can be prevented, one-third can be treated, and one-third can have pain reduced. In this regard, drugs play an increasingly important role. For example, China's domestically produced new anti-tumor drugs VP-16 and epirubicin have made contributions to improving the clinical level of tumor internal medicine.

　　肿瘤进入综合治疗时代
    可预防可治疗可减少痛苦的各占１／３
    本报北京３月６日讯  记者艾笑报道：中国癌症研究基金会专家今天在一个介绍抗癌新药的学术活动中披露：进入８０年代，抗癌药物发展迅速，已使肿瘤的治疗进入综合时代。在这方面，我国有显著成就。
    近来，全世界每年约有６００万人发生癌症，５００万人因此丧命。我国的癌症发病率正呈上升趋势，每年约有１００万新的患者，８０万人的生命被癌细胞吞噬。
    世界卫生组织指出：癌症１／３可以预防，１／３可以治疗，１／３可以减少痛苦。在这方面药物起了越来越重要的作用。如我国推出的国产抗肿瘤新药ＶＰ—１６、表阿霉素等，在提高肿瘤内科临床水平上做出了贡献。
