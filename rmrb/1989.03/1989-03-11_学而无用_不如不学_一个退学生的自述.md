Title: Learning Without Use Is Better Than Not Learning At All – A Dropout's Account

As a dropout, I am also included in the discussion on the education crisis. I really find it strange. Do all dropouts, as people say, lack knowledge and are short-sighted money-makers? I do not deny that there are many students who drop out to make money, leading to the lament of "knowledge depreciation."

I feel that if one thinks that school has not provided much education or help, it is better to leave and make room for others, rather than wasting time doing nothing. After all, one will eventually leave school, so if one does not adapt to school life, it is better to enter society early. Of course, entering society is to better find a suitable place to develop oneself and do what one should do after graduating from school.

In people's minds, dropping out often means not liking to study and being poor in all aspects; or it is due to family pressure. Neither of these situations applies to me. Although I am not an excellent student in school, I can say that my grades are good; my family not only supports me in attending high school but also hopes that I can go to university.

It was I who proposed to drop out. I also yearn for university. But how many people can really win in the "bloodless" competition? I grew up in school and know the "hellish" life there. My father is a teacher. I really cannot imagine how to live such an ascetic life. I am afraid that after three years, it will be like drawing water with a bamboo basket, and I do not want to waste three years in vain. From this point of view, I am indeed stingy, or more precisely, a coward, a weakling in life. However, if you think about it carefully, the only useful time in ten years of hard study is the three days of the college entrance examination. The knowledge in the textbooks is only important at that time. Apart from that, textbooks can only find their value in a scrap collection station. Society will eventually discard textbooks, so I also discarded textbooks. I do not think my knowledge is less than that of a student in school, and I do not admit to being ignorant.

My parents are teachers in a university, and they were really surprised and disappointed by my choice. I once felt proud that only one female classmate from my middle school went to high school, but now I have no capital for pride, yet I do not feel sorry at all. Someone wonders, if you do not want to go to high school, why not go to a vocational school? This is simple: there is no suitable major. In the midst of the serious discussion about the education crisis, I do not feel regretful and hope that I will not regret it in the future.

I am a student who dropped out midway. When I am passionately discussing the fundamental issue of governing the country—education—this social problem, I do not feel regretful or ashamed, but rather a sense of mocking society.

### 学而无用　不如不学——一个退学生的自述

　　学而无用　不如不学——
    一个退学生的自述
    广西桂林  文晓锋
    作为一个退学的学生，我也被列为教育危机的讨论对象。
    我真觉得奇怪，难道退学的都像人们所说的那样无知，都是挣大钱、眼光短浅之辈吗？我不否认的确有很多学生为了赚钱中途退学，从而引起“知识贬值”的感叹。
    我觉得如果认为学校对你并没有太大的教育和帮助，与其在那里天天无所事事，消磨时间，不如让出一张桌子，也好让老师少劳点神。反正早晚也得从学校出来，既然你不适应学校生活，干脆现在就走上社会。当然走上社会是为了更好地在适合你的地方发挥自己，提前去做几年你从学校毕业后应该做的事。
    在人们的头脑里退学往往是不爱学习，各方面都较差的；要不就是迫于家庭压力而不得不这样的。这两种情况对于我都不符合。在学校我虽然算不上优等生，但可以说成绩良好；家里不但支持我读高中，还希望我能上大学。
    是我自己主动提出了退学的。我同样向往大学。但是经过“不流血”的竞争真正获胜者能有多少？我从小就在学校长大，清楚那“地狱”般的生活。我的父亲就是教师。我真不敢想象那种苦行僧生涯该怎么过？只怕三年后竹篮打水一场空，我不愿白白辛苦三年。从这方面来说，我的确很吝啬，更确切地说是一个懦怯者，是生活的弱者，然而仔细一想，十年寒窗真正能用上的只有高考那三天时间，课本上的知识只有那时才显得是如此重要。除此之外，课本只能在废品收购站找到它的价值。社会最终要抛弃课本，于是我也抛弃了课本。我自认为知识不比在校生少，更不承认无知。
    我的家长是大学学府的教师，对我的选择实在是吃惊而失望。我曾为初中只有我一个女同学升高中而自豪，如今我没有自豪资本了，却丝毫不感到可惜。有人奇怪，既然你不愿读高中，为何不上职业中学呢？这很简单：没有合适的专业。在一片教育危机的严重性的议论中我不感到后悔，希望将来也不会后悔。
    我是一个中途退学的学生。我在慷慨激昂地谈论关于治国的根本——教育这一社会问题时，却并没有后悔、羞愧之感，倒有一种戏弄社会之感。
