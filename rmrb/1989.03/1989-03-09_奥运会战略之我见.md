Our athletes secured 5 gold medals at the 24th Olympic Games, the largest-scale global sports event in 12 years, prompting a calm reassessment and analysis of our Olympic strategy.

I believe that the focus of the national games, which are held in conjunction with the Olympic strategy, is not prominent. Instead, the number of events continues to increase, leading to more drawbacks than benefits. China has had an Olympic strategy since 1984, holding two national sports development strategy seminars and publishing the book "China's Sports in the Year 2000," which comprehensively discusses the possibility of becoming a sports powerhouse by the end of the century. Looking at the situation over the past few years, our strategic deployments do not align well with our national conditions. Economically and culturally backward provinces and regions have to spread their limited human, material, and financial resources across numerous projects to increase their overall team score, which is a significant waste. This approach overlooks our fundamental national condition of economic backwardness and underdeveloped science and culture.

Since the competition reform, China's sports competitions have been developing towards large-scale, diverse, and institutionalized formats, severely impacting our competitive strategy that prioritizes the Olympics and deviating from our main direction. Statistics show that in recent years, there have been numerous large-scale national sports events, including the National Games, Youth Games, City Games, Workers' Sports Games, Farmers' Sports Games, University Sports Games, and Ethnic Minority Sports Games. These events are essentially competitions among partially retired and training elite athletes, whom the public refers to as "mercenaries." Relevant departments should further clarify their main tasks and avoid dispersing their forces. In the competition system reform, we should establish a competition system that suits our national conditions and is conducive to implementing the Olympic strategy.

With the acceleration of sports socialization, various sponsored competitions are increasing, and many excellent teams are overwhelmed by invitational tournaments with various names. Attracted by generous treatment and high prizes, they abandon systematic training to participate in competitions. After the competitions, both winning and losing teams find that their systematic training has been disrupted, which is a common lesson.

This year, the National Youth Games will be held in Liaoning. The purpose of holding the Youth Games is to accelerate the growth of reserve forces. However, due to the Youth Games being turned into a large-scale comprehensive sports event and influenced by the practice of counting team scores and the number of gold medals in the National Games, the competition intensity of the Youth Games has been inadvertently intensified. To achieve better results in the Youth Games, various units have formulated generous reward schemes. Consequently, some coaches, disregarding the laws of adolescent physical development, adopt short-sighted and hasty methods, ruining a large number of rising stars. To overcome these drawbacks, it might be beneficial to transform the Youth Games into key project competitions or training camps. During the competition period, the State Sports Commission can organize researchers and technical experts to test and evaluate the participating athletes, selecting outstanding athletes for training. Simultaneously, focusing on Olympic projects, we can fully utilize the geographical, climatic conditions, and talent advantages of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to establish single-sport schools and build Olympic training bases, implementing scientific training and management. I believe that focusing on key projects while nurturing reserve forces should be the fundamental starting point for our Olympic strategy.

### 奥运会战略之我见

　　奥运会战略之我见
    翟立朝
    我国运动员在第２４届奥运会这个１２年来规模最大的世界体育盛会上夺得５枚金牌的事实，使人们冷静地对我国的奥运战略问题重新进行思考和分析。
    我认为，围绕着奥运战略所设立的全运会比赛项目重点不突出，而且越设越多，弊多利少。我国早在１９８４年就确定了奥运会战略，召开了两次全国体育发展战略研讨会，编写出版了《２０００年的中国体育》一书，对在本世纪末实现体育强国的可能性进行了全面论证。从近几年的情况看，我们实施的战略部署，是不大符合我们的国情。一些经济文化落后的省区不得不把有限的人力、物力、财力平摊到众多的项目上去，以期增加团体总分，这实际上是最大浪费。这种做法忽略了我国经济落后、科学文化不够发达这一基本国情。
    竞赛改革以来，我国的运动竞赛正朝着大型化、多样化、制度化发展，严重冲击了以奥运会为最高层次的竞技战略，偏离了我们的主攻方向。据统计，近几年来全国性的大型运动会有全运会、青运会、城运会、职工运动会、农民运动会、大学生运动会、少数民族运动会等，这些运动会其实都是部分退役和在训的优秀运动员进行比赛，广大群众把这批运动员称之为雇佣军。有关部门应进一步明确主要任务，避免分散使用力量。在竞赛体制改革中制定出适合我国国情的、有利于实施奥运会战略的竞赛制度。
    随着体育社会化进程的加快，各种赞助性比赛越来越多，许多优秀运动队对冠以种种名堂的邀请赛应接不暇。由于优厚的待遇和高额的奖金吸引，他们放弃系统训练去参加比赛。比赛之后，获胜的队和失利的队系统训练被破坏则是共同的教训。
    今年在辽宁又将举办全国青运会。举办青运会的目的是为了加速后备力量成长，然而，由于青运会办成了大型综合性运动会，再加上受全运会记团体总分、比金牌总数做法的影响，无形中加剧了青运会竞争的激烈程度。为了在青运会上争取较好成绩，各单位都制订了重奖办法。这样以来，有些教练就违背青少年身体发育规律，采用急功近利，拔苗助长的做法，报废了一大批后起之秀。为了克服弊端，不妨把青运会改为重点项目比赛或集训比赛。在比赛期间，国家体委组织科研人员和技术专家，对参赛运动员进行测试和评定，从中选拔优秀选手进行培养。同时，以奥运会项目为重点，充分利用各省、市、自治区的地理气候条件和人才优势，成立单项体育学校、建立奥运会集训基地，实行科学训练和科学管理。我认为，一手抓重点项，一手抓后备力量，应是我们制定奥运会战略的基本出发点。
