Excerpts from Group Discussions at the Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

China Association for Science and Technology Vice Chairman Zhang Wei said:

Leaders should lead by example in hardship
The government work report mentioned the need to endure hardship, and I fully agree. Currently, the public feels that it's fine to live a bit tough, but the key is for everyone to be united, with leaders setting an example. Why not start from the central leadership and switch from imported cars to domestically produced ones? If leaders can lead by example in enduring hardship, societal ills will quickly be rectified. I also suggest reviewing some past slogans that have had a lasting negative impact, such as "high consumption." These were proposed by leaders and now seem impractical. Additionally, the issue of clean governance has been raised for several years, but the central government has not been strict enough, and the problem is worsening. I hope we can seriously review the lessons learned.

Special Invitee Military Committee Member Li Shuqing said:

Maintaining central authority is crucial
The report's emphasis on resolutely supporting central authority is excellent. Without highly centralized and unified leadership, the tasks of rectification, deepening reform, and governance cannot be accomplished. The authority of the central leadership primarily depends on the central leadership itself. Central leaders must be cautious in their speeches and decisions; their words and decisions must be reliable. On major issues, they must not waver, and once a decision is made, it must be implemented. If something is said but not done, it will lose credibility. For example, a few years ago, central leaders spoke of achieving fundamental improvements in party discipline, social ethics, and fiscal conditions within five years, but this has not been realized yet.

Former Director of the National Tourism Administration Han Kehua said:

Party and government integrity is essential for effective governance
The issue of orders not being followed and prohibitions not being heeded is, in my view, a case of "top-down policies, bottom-up countermeasures." Mistakes are inevitable and relatively easy to resolve, but if corruption is rampant and effective measures are not taken to address it quickly, it will be difficult to manage. The government work report does not sufficiently address how to solve the problem of integrity. A major issue in the circulation sector is "official profiteering." Official profiteering has significant power and influence. How has the rectification of the five major companies gone? What is the situation with official profiteering in some large state-owned companies? It is unclear. Inequality in distribution is inevitable, but some people are not enriching themselves through legitimate means. The Party Central Committee and the State Council should take decisive action, focus on a few major issues, and implement strict measures to resolve them.

Air Force Academy Command System Deputy Director Li Dawei said:

Leaders must have a sense of crisis
I have been in mainland China for six years, and the country has made significant progress in these six years, with people becoming more courageous in speaking out, which is a sign of hope for the nation. However, I believe the biggest problem is people. Nowadays, people greet each other by talking about food and money. Regarding this situation, national leaders must have a sense of crisis and not just criticize themselves for the same problems year after year. Acknowledging problems requires courage, but more importantly, problems must be solved.

Agricultural and Industrial Party Central Vice Chairman Jian Tiancong said:

Population control requires specific measures
Regarding the population issue, the government work report only mentions hopes and targets but lacks specific measures. Currently, the phenomenon of "stealthily giving birth, running away to give birth, buying to give birth, hiding to give birth" persists in rural areas. If this continues, the arduous task of population control cannot be accomplished.

Shenyang City Democratic Progress Committee Deputy Director Gao Shiping said:

Education should implement "three powers separation"
To increase the sources of educational funds and ensure that educational funds are used for education, we can try establishing an educational bank. National allocations, social fundraising, and personal donations should all be deposited into the educational bank, which will manage them centrally. The educational bank can fully play its role in fundraising, regulation, and supervision. To improve educational standards and cultivate talents suitable for modern construction, education should implement "three powers separation," that is, the state's macro-planning authority, local implementation decision-making authority, and schools' autonomous management authority should be separated, with each level having genuine power. This will change the situation where education is uniform and lacks individuality.

### 全国政协七届二次会议小组发言摘编

　　全国政协七届二次会议小组发言摘编
    中国科协副主席张维说：
    领导要带头过苦日子
    政府工作报告提到要过苦日子，我很赞成。现在群众反映，生活苦一点没什么，但关键要上下一致，领导应带头吃苦，不能只要求老百姓过苦日子。举个例子，能否从中央领导开始，不坐进口车，改乘国产车呢？领导若能带头吃苦，社会上的不良风气就会很快扭转。我还建议对一些过去提出的已造成深远的不良影响的口号加以清理。如“高消费”等，这些都是领导提出的，现在看来行不通。另外，为政要清廉的问题已提了好几年，但中央抓得不够狠，愈演愈烈，希望认真总结一下教训。
    　　　　特邀军队委员李水清说：
    　　维护中央权威至关重要
    报告中关于必须坚决拥护中央权威的话讲得很好，没有高度集中统一的领导，治理整顿深化改革的任务是完不成的。中央的领导威信，主要还是要靠中央自己，中央领导同志讲话、作决定一定要慎重；讲的话、作出的决定要算数，在重大问题上不能手软，决定了的事情就要落实，说了的事情办不到就会失掉威信。比如前几年中央领导同志讲要在５年之内实现党风、社会风气、财政状况根本好转，可到现在仍没有实现。
    　　　　原国家旅游局局长韩克华说：
    　　党政廉洁才能令行禁止
    有令不行、有禁不止的问题，我认为是“上有政策、下有对策”。失误难免，较易解决；但如果风气腐败，不采取有效措施尽快解决就难办了。政府工作报告中对如何解决廉洁问题还讲得不够。流通领域中较大的问题是“官倒”。“官倒”权力大，影响大。五大公司整顿得如何？一些较大的国家性质的公司“官倒”情况如何？不清楚。分配不公难免，但有人不是靠正当手段富起来的。党中央、国务院应下狠心，抓住几个大问题，采取严厉措施加以解决。
    　　　　空军学院指挥系副主任李大维说：
    　　领导人要有忧患意识
    我从台湾来大陆６年，这６年国家取得的成就是大的，一天比一天进步，人们说话的勇气也越来越大，这是国家的希望。但是，我认为最大的问题是人，现在的人一见面就谈吃、谈钱。对于这种情况，国家领导人要有忧患意识，不要每年开会都说去年如何不好，第二年还是就这些问题作自我批评。承认问题是种勇气，但更重要的是解决问题。
    　　　　农工党中央副主席翦天聪说：
    　　控制人口要拿出具体措施
    关于人口问题，政府工作报告上只有希望和指标，没有具体措施。目前农村那种“偷着生，跑着生，买着生，躲着生”的现象没有改变，这样下去不能完成人口控制的艰巨任务。
    　　　　辽宁省沈阳市民进副主委高士品说：
    　　教育应实行“三权分立”
    为了增加教育经费来源和确保教育经费用于教育，可试办教育银行。国家的拨款，社会集资和个人赞助的资金全部投入教育银行，由银行统一掌握。教育银行可充分发挥集资、调控、监督等作用。为了提高教育水平，培养各种适应现代化建设的人才，教育应实行“三权分立”，即国家的宏观规划权，地方的实施决策权和学校的办学自主权相互分开，各级都享有真正权力，改变教育千人一面，没有个性的状况。
