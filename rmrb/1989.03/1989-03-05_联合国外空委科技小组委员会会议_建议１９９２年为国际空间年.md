The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space Science and Technology Subcommittee's 26th meeting concluded today at the United Nations headquarters, endorsing the proposal to designate 1992 as the "International Space Year."

The current session of the Science and Technology Subcommittee began on February 21, with representatives from 46 countries, including China, and representatives from 11 international organizations, such as the European Space Agency, in attendance. The representatives unanimously agreed to strengthen international cooperation in space activities and the application of technology. The meeting proposed that a series of strict safety measures be adopted when using nuclear power sources in space, and that safety standards be established.

The meeting emphasized that data obtained from satellite remote sensing of the Earth should be provided at low cost and in a timely manner to meet the needs of developing countries, and that data obtained from meteorological satellites should be provided free of charge to relevant countries.

The meeting also urged all countries to participate as much as possible in the "Earth-Space-Biosphere Program" activities of the 1990s to jointly address issues related to global climate change.
