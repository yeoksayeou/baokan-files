Edition: 4

The fate of essays has been tumultuous, and for the first time, they have become the subject of academic discussion by critics. On March 11, the China Writers Association's Creation Research Department held a discussion meeting on Shao Yanxiang's essay works. More than 30 literary critics, essayists, and theorists attended the meeting.

Shao Yanxiang has just topped the list in the national excellent essay (collection) awards with his "One Hundred Pieces of Joy and Sorrow." In the 1940s, Shao Yanxiang began writing essays. After the founding of the nation, he devoted himself to the creation of lyric poetry. Starting in the mid-1980s, he focused his creative energy primarily on essays. His works that have been compiled include "Honey and Thorns," "Morning and Evening Random Notes," "One Hundred Pieces of Joy and Sorrow," and "Green Light Collection." From Shao Yanxiang's creative experience, the attendees generally agreed that today is still the era of essays, and we still need the pen of Lu Xun. Essays are still the conscience and rationality of our era's literature. At this time, the rise of essays and reportage literature indicates that a period of change needs essays. It is in such an era, where essays are needed and once again flourishing, that Shao Yanxiang has become a true and mature essayist. The appearance of a large number of Shao Yanxiang's excellent works is the choice of the times.

While discussing the ideological achievements and artistic accomplishments of Shao Yanxiang's essays, the attendees reviewed the rise and fall of essays in contemporary Chinese literary history and the changes in essay creation. They reached a consensus on the social function of essays and the social responsibility of essayists. Everyone agreed that essays conquer readers with their critical rationality and wise humor.

Those who spoke at the discussion meeting included Mu Hui, Ge Yang, Yu Guangyuan, Zhang Zhi, He Xilai, Li Honglin, Lan Ling, Shu Zhan, Chen Xiaochuan, Yu Haocheng, Wu Fang, Sheng Zuhong, Liu Meng, Qin Jin, Feng Lisan, and Wang Ruoshui. Gu Xiang presided over this discussion meeting.

　　杂文首次进入学术界视野
    邵燕祥杂文研讨会在京举行
    本报讯  命运多舛的杂文第一次成为评论家学术研讨的对象。３月１１日，在中国作家协会创作研究部为邵燕祥杂文作品召开的讨论会上，３０多位文学评论家、杂文作家和理论界人士参加了会议。
    邵燕祥刚以他的《忧乐百篇》在全国优秀杂文（集）评奖中名列榜首。４０年代，邵燕祥即开始杂文创作。建国后，致力于抒情诗的创作；８０年代中期开始，他把创作的主要精力倾注于杂文。目前已经结集的有《蜜和刺》、《晨昏随笔》、《忧乐百篇》、《绿灯小集》等。从邵燕祥的创作经历，与会者普遍认为，今天仍然是杂文的时代，仍需鲁迅笔法，杂文仍然是我们时代文学的良心和理性。这些时，杂文和纪实文学的勃兴表明，变革时期需要杂文。邵燕祥正是在这样一个需要杂文、杂文又一次勃兴的时代成为一个真正的、成熟的杂文家的。邵燕祥大量佳作的出现是时代的选择。
    研讨邵燕祥杂文的思想成就和艺术建树的同时，与会者回顾了中国当代文学史上杂文的兴衰和杂文创作的嬗变，对杂文的社会功能和杂文作家的社会职责达到了共识。大家认为，杂文征服读者，靠的是批判的理性和智慧的幽默。
    在讨论会上先后发言的有牧惠、戈扬、于光远、张锲、何西来、李洪林、蓝翎、舒展、陈小川、于浩成、吴方、盛祖宏、柳萌、秦晋、冯立三、王若水等人。顾骧主持了这次讨论会。
