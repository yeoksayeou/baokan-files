It has been reported that some businessmen from Western countries have, through various channels and methods, transported large quantities of toxic waste into Africa, where it is stored or destroyed. A magazine published in Paris bluntly referred to 1988 as the "Year of Toxic Waste" for Africa, and this is not an exaggeration. Some people have their sights set on Namibia, which is about to begin its process of independence, as the next target. Perhaps the vast desert sands make it easier to conceal these clandestine, dirty dealings. To date, these transactions have been conducted in secret, and it is unclear just how much toxic waste has been brought into Africa. However, everyone knows that pollution and death follow in the wake of toxic waste. Therefore, in the words of the African people, these are truly "merchants of death."

The "merchants of death" exploit the financial difficulties and weaknesses of some African countries to peddle their wares. But grand agreements and trade terms that comply with legal provisions cannot conceal the barbarism beneath the veneer of civilization, for they infringe upon the African people's fundamental right to life.

Some of these "merchants of death" are Western companies themselves, while others are agents hired by Western companies. In this day and age when people are talking so much about human rights, how will those who claim to be "guardians of human rights" prove their devotion to "human rights" in the face of these "merchants of death" who are even more ruthless than Shakespeare's Shylock?

Fortunately, African countries have already recognized the seriousness of the "toxic waste" issue and have begun to fight to protect their living environment.

　　“死亡商人”的勾当
    据报道，一些西方国家的商人，通过各种渠道和手段，把大量有毒废料运进非洲，在那里贮存或销毁。巴黎出版的一家杂志直截了当地把１９８８年称为非洲“有毒废料年”，这并非耸人听闻。一些人“眼光”宽阔得很，据说即将开始独立进程的纳米比亚是下一个目标。也许漫漫黄沙更易于掩盖这悄悄进行的肮脏勾当。迄今，这种交易都是秘密进行的，人们弄不清运进非洲的有毒废料到底有多么庞大。可谁都知道，随有毒废料而来的是污染，是死亡，所以用非洲人民的话来说，这是一伙名副其实的“死亡商人”。
    “死亡商人”利用一些非洲国家的财政困难和存在的弱点以售其奸。但冠冕堂皇的协议和符合法律条文的贸易条款，却无法掩盖这种文明招牌下的野蛮，因为它侵犯了非洲人民的基本权利——生存权。
    有的“死亡商人”本身就是西方公司，有的则是受西方公司雇佣的掮客。在人们大讲人权的今天，面对这些比莎士比亚笔下的夏洛克还夏洛克的“死亡商人”，那些自诩的“人权卫士”们将如何证实他们对“人权”的虔诚呢？
    值得庆幸的是，非洲国家已经看到“有毒废料”的严重性，并开始为保护自己的生存环境而斗争。
