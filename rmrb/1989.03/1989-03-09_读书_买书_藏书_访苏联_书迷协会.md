People have long known that Soviet citizens love to read; in subway cars and queues for sausages, one can always see someone engrossed in a book. The Soviet Union publishes a lot of books, with 6 million copies printed daily and an average of 8 books per person per year. Book prices in the Soviet Union are low; skipping one kilogram of cucumbers from the free market can buy a set of Pushkin's three-volume collection, bound in leather with gold embossing and totaling 1,800 pages. However, not many people know that Soviet book lovers have a nationwide organization.

In early March, the reporter visited the so-called "Book Lovers' Society," the All-Soviet Voluntary Society of Book Lovers. The deputy chairman of the society's executive committee, Dr. Shvavalov, introduced this mass organization with nearly 20 million members.

Shvavalov said that the Book Lovers' Society was established 15 years ago. Currently, there are nearly 200,000 grassroots organizations spread across various enterprises, institutions, and schools. They engage in various activities: meeting with authors, evaluating books in reader clubs set up in bookstores, and recommending good books to colleagues during breaks. They also frequently purchase best-selling books from bookstores and distribute them to colleagues who do not have time to queue, with these "people's bookstores" numbering 15,000 nationwide.

The Soviet Union has 300,000 public libraries with a total of 5 billion books, but the total number of books in private collections is nine times that amount. Among the more than 40 members of the Book Lovers' Society's central committee, everyone has a collection of more than 1,000 books, and all of them are open to friends. Currently, more than 1,500 members open their personal collections. The society helps these enthusiasts establish book catalogs and lending certificates, and several dozen book repair societies provide free services to them.

Reading interests should be cultivated from a young age. Fifty-six percent of the Book Lovers' Society's members are teenagers and children. There are 56,000 "little book lovers" clubs in Soviet primary and secondary schools, and they are active participants in the spring and summer book festivals held in various places each year.

Shvavalov proudly said that the Book Lovers' Society is a self-sustaining social organization, with funds coming from the 9 kopecks monthly membership fee and income from lectures, exhibitions, etc., totaling 25 million rubles per year. Last year, they donated 4 million rubles worth of books to rural libraries and 1 million rubles to Armenian disaster victims.

After an hour of conversation, Shvavalov bid farewell to the reporter to meet with voters. He had been nominated as a candidate for the People's Representative by the Book Lovers' Society and several electoral districts. As he put on his coat, he said to the reporter, "Opposing book price increases, publishing plans should meet reader demands; for the convenience of the disabled, libraries should remove all steps and convert to barrier-free access—this is one of the points in my election platform."

### 读书·买书·藏书——访苏联“书迷协会”

　　读书·买书·藏书
    ——访苏联“书迷协会”
    新华社记者  盛世良
    人们早就知道，苏联人爱读书，地铁车厢里，买香肠的队伍中，总有人手不释卷；苏联出书多，每天６００万册，每年人均８本；苏联书价低，少吃１公斤自由市场上的黄瓜，就可以买一套漆布烫金精装、洋洋１８００页的普希金３卷集。但是，苏联书迷有一个全国性的组织，知道的人也许不多。
    ３月初，记者走访了俗称“书迷协会”的全苏书籍爱好者志愿协会。该协会理事会第一副主席舒瓦洛夫博士介绍了这个拥有近２０００万会员的群众性组织。
    舒瓦洛夫说，书迷协会是１５年前成立的。目前有近２０万个基层组织，分布在各地企业、机关和学校。他们以多种形式开展活动：同作家会见，在书店附设的读者俱乐部评议某一时期或某一类型的书籍，利用课间或工间休息向同伴推荐好书等。他们还经常到书店购买畅销书籍，发售给无暇排队的伙伴，这种“人民书店”全国共１．５万个。
    苏联拥有３０万个公共图书馆，藏书５０亿册，但私人藏书总量是此数的９倍。在书迷协会中央理事会的４０多名理事中，人人藏书都在千卷以上，而且都对朋友开放。目前有１５００多名会员开放个人藏书。协会帮助这些热心人建立图书编目和借书证，几十个图书修补社免费为他们服务。
    阅读兴趣要从小培养。书迷协会５６％的会员是青少年和儿童。苏联中小学有５．６万个“小书迷”俱乐部，他们是每年春夏各地图书节的积极参加者。
    舒瓦洛夫自豪地说，书迷协会是一个自负盈亏的社会团体，经费来自会员每月９戈比会费和讲座、展览等收入，一年有２５００万卢布。去年还捐赠给乡村图书馆价值４００万卢布的图书，捐给亚美尼亚灾民１００万卢布。
    交谈一小时后，舒瓦洛夫即告别记者去会见选民，他已被书迷协会和好几个选区推选为人民代表候选人。他边穿大衣边对记者说，“反对图书涨价，出版计划应符合读者要求；为方便伤残人，图书馆应一律撤掉阶梯，改成无障碍通行——这是我的竞选纲领中的一条。”
