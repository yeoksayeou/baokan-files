On the afternoon of February 25, U.S. President George H.W. Bush and his wife stepped off the special plane that had just landed at Beijing Airport. Facing the Chinese personnel who came to welcome them, Bush lifted his iron-gray suit jacket and pointed to the label, saying, "Red Capital! Red Capital!"

It turned out that Bush was wearing a suit made by the Beijing Red Capital Clothing Company for his visit to China.

How did the products of "Red Capital" cross the Pacific Ocean and gain the favor of the U.S. President?

On February 26, when some journalists from Beijing's media outlets, with great interest, interviewed the Red Capital Clothing Company about this matter, the managers did not seem surprised.

General Manager Xīn Bǎocái said that Bush wearing a "Red Capital"-made suit to visit China was something he had anticipated. Just two days before Bush's visit, Xīn Bǎocái brought the sample of a suit made for Chairman Yang Shangkun to Yang's residence. He mentioned to Chairman Yang Shangkun, "I heard that Bush is about to visit China. In the past, when he was the head of the U.S. Liaison Office in Beijing, he had many suits made here. Perhaps this time he will wear one of our suits." Chairman Yang nodded with a smile, saying, "That would be great. Your suits are indeed well-made. I see that Comrade Zhao Ziyang's suit fits him very well."

Deputy General Manager Zhāng Yǒngfú, who had once measured Bush's size, said, "During Bush's time in Beijing, he often came here with his wife on bicycles to have suits made. They were very approachable here, and sometimes they even spoke a few words in Chinese. We also treated them without any restraint."

Bush and his wife's suits were mostly made by senior tailor Tián Ālóng. Master Tián said, "Before Bush was stationed in Beijing, the first head of the U.S. Liaison Office in China, David Bruce, also had more than 60 suits made here. Before Bruce left his post, he specially rushed to 'Red Capital' to order an evening suit, which we made and sent to the U.S."

The Red Capital Clothing Company is renowned for its fine craftsmanship. It is an enterprise that developed from six clothing stores—Léimén, Bōwěi, Lántiān, Hóngxiá, Jīntài—that moved from Shanghai to Beijing 30 years ago. The company has a group of highly skilled tailors like Tián Ālóng, Líng Qíshēng, and Dīng Kuíyīng. As early as the 1950s and 1960s, "Red Capital" often made clothes for party and state leaders.

In the reception room of the "Red Capital" company, the reporter noticed a large photo of the new Standing Committee members of the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China—Zhào Zìyáng, Lǐ Péng, Qiáo Shì, Hú Qǐlì, and Yáo Yǐlín—appearing together at a press conference. Deputy General Manager Xú Xiángfú said that the five Central Committee members were wearing suits made by "Red Capital" that day. When Zhao Ziyang, then Premier, visited Japan, the Japanese thought his suit was made in France. Upon seeing the "Red Capital" label, they were surprised.

"Red Capital" is not only famous in Beijing but has also made a leap from domestic to international markets. Because Chinese leaders and people going abroad often wear "Red Capital"-made suits to receive foreign guests and visit other countries, their attire is always noticed and commented on by foreigners. The reputation of "Red Capital" has also grown overseas. Many foreign diplomats stationed in China have become customers of "Red Capital"; many heads of state visiting China have also come to "Red Capital" to order suits. In the 1960s, a foreign president once ordered more than 20 suits from "Red Capital." The company worked overnight to complete the order, making the president's wish come true before he left Beijing. Norodom Sihanouk, who loves French clothing, also praised the suits made by "Red Capital." To express his gratitude to the masters of "Red Capital" for their hard work, he and his wife specially presented "Red Capital" with a silk embroidery featuring Chairman Mao Zedong and himself on Tiananmen Gate, and a badge.

The name "Red Capital" is known to many friends overseas. As more and more foreign friends come here to have suits made, "Red Capital" company, in addition to assigning specific personnel to serve foreign guests, has also established measurement records and various clothing size archives for foreign guests who have had suits made here. In this way, even if foreign friends do not come to Beijing, as long as they send a letter, "Red Capital" can refer to the archives to make a well-fitting suit and send it to the customer's country.

"Red Capital" is no longer just China's "Red Capital" ...

　　“红都”的跨越
     本报记者  王谨
    ２月２５日下午，美国总统布什和夫人走下刚刚降落在北京机场的专机，面对着前来欢迎的中国人员，掀开自己的铁灰色西服上装，用手指着上面的商标说：“红都！红都！”
    原来，布什是穿着由北京红都服装公司制作的西服来华访问的。
    “红都”的产品是怎样跨越太平洋，受到美国总统的青睐呢？
    ２月２６日，当北京一些新闻媒介的记者怀着浓厚的兴趣，就此事采访红都服装公司时，经理们并没有感到意外。
    总经理辛宝才说，布什穿“红都”制作的衣服来华是他预料之中的。就在布什总统来华访问的前两天，辛宝才带着国家主席杨尚昆所定做衣服的衣样来到杨主席住地时，对杨尚昆主席念叨说：“听说布什即将访华，过去他在北京担任美国驻华联络处主任时到‘红都’做过不少衣服，也许这次会穿我们做的衣服来。”杨主席笑着点头说：“那好哇。你们的衣服确实做的不错，我看紫阳同志穿的衣服就很合身。”
    曾经为布什量过体的公司副总经理张永福说：“布什在北京那些年，经常和夫人骑着车子到这里做衣服。他们到这里来很随和，有时还说几句华语。我们接待他们也从不拘束。”
    布什夫妇的衣服大都是高级服装师田阿桐经手制作的。田师傅说：“在布什驻北京之前，美国第一任驻华联络处主任戴维·布鲁斯也先后在这里做了６０多套衣服。布鲁斯离任前，还特地赶到“红都”，定作了一套晚礼服，由我们做好后寄往美国。”
    “红都”服装公司以做工精细而著称。这是一家３０年前由上海迁京的雷蒙、波伟、蓝天、鸿霞、金泰等６家服装店发展起来的企业，拥有一批像田阿桐、凌奚生、丁奎英这样技艺高超的服装制作大师。早在五六十年代，“红都”就经常为党和国家领导人承做衣服。
    在“红都”公司的会客室里，记者注意到墙上挂着中共十二大产生的新常委赵紫阳、李鹏、乔石、胡启立、姚依林在记者招待会上集体亮相的巨幅照片。徐祥福副总经理说，五位中央常委这天身着的衣服都是在“红都”制作的。赵紫阳任总理访问日本时，日本人还以为他的衣服是法国做的，一看竟是“红都”的商标，感到吃惊。
    “红都”不仅声震京都，而且实现了从国内向海外的跨越。由于中国领导人和出国人员大都穿着“红都”制作的衣服接待外宾和出访，因而他们的衣着时时受到国外人士的注目和评论，“红都”的名声在国外也越来越大了。许多国家驻华外交官捷足先登成了“红都”的主顾；来访的许多国家元首也纷纷慕名前来“红都”定作衣服。６０年代，一位外国总统一次就让“红都”制作了二十多套衣服，“红都”公司连夜赶制，终于使这位总统离京前如愿以偿。酷爱法国服装的诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王，也对“红都”为他制作的西服赞声不迭。为感谢“红都”大师们付出的劳动，他和夫人特地赠送给“红都”一幅绣有当年毛泽东主席和他在天安门城楼图案的丝织品和一枚胸章。
    “红都”的名字被海外众多的友人所知晓。随着外国朋友在这儿做衣服越来越多，“红都”公司除指定专人为外宾服务外，还为来此做过衣服的外宾设立了量体及各种衣服尺寸的档案。这样，外国朋友即使不到北京，只要来一封信，“红都”也可以参照档案，为对方作出合身的衣服寄到客户所在国家。
    “红都”已不仅仅是中国的“红都”了……
