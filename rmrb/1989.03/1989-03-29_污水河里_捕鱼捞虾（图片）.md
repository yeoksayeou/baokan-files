The Xiaoqing River in the eastern part of our city is a river severely polluted by industrial waste. In recent years, numerous fishermen have been fishing and catching shrimp in this river day and night. They sell the polluted fish and shrimp they catch at the market, posing a serious threat to people's health. We hope that the relevant departments will address the pollution in the Xiaoqing River and prohibit fishing and shrimp catching in the river.

    污水河里  捕鱼捞虾
    我市东面的小清河，是工业污染较为严重的河流。近几年来，众多的捕捞者在这条河里日夜捕鱼捞虾。他们将捕捞的已被污染的鱼虾，拿到集市上去卖，严重威胁着人们的身体健康。希望有关部门治理小清河污染，并禁止在河里捕捞鱼虾。
