Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, March 10th - Archaeologists in Yunnan have recently discovered a batch of tools dating back approximately one million years from the early Old Stone Age in Jiangchuan County. It is reported that this site is the second early Pleistocene primitive cultural site discovered in Yunnan after the Yunnan Man site.

The archaeological team found these primitive tools on the surface and in the strata of a mountain valley in Longtan Village, Luzhu Township, Jiangchuan County. After research, it was confirmed that there are at least six of these primitive tools, including three stone tools and three bone tools. The stone tools have distinct edges and clear signs of human hammering, while the bone tools have slanted cutting edges and scraping marks, all of which are indicative of primitive collection tools used by early humans.

Archaeologists also discovered a batch of mammal fossils with Pleistocene characteristics, including axis deer, water deer, and fallow deer, at the same location.

　　滇发现百万年前原始工具
    新华社昆明３月１０日电  （记者李承祖）云南考古工作者新近在江川县发现一批距今约１００万年前的旧石器时代早期的工具。据介绍，这里是继元谋猿人遗址后在云南发现的第二个早更新世原始文化地点。
    考古队是在江川县路居乡龙潭村一个山箐的地表和地层中，发现这批原始工具的。经研究确认，这批原始工具至少有６件，其中石器和骨器各３件。石器有明显的棱角和人工砸击痕迹，骨器有倾斜的刃口和刮削痕迹，均属原始人的采集工具。
    考古工作者还在同一地点发现了轴鹿、湖鹿、水鹿等具有更新世特征的一批哺乳类动物化石。
