Title: Reading "Again Seeing 'Li Sao'"

Book reviews are a type of essay (miscellaneous essay). Once, Zhang Di and Yao Jichuan categorized 13 types of literature into 11, with the third being prefaces and postscripts, defined as "describing the intent of others' works," "whether it is called a preface, postscript, introduction, title, reading, biography, annotation, commentary, explanation, interpretation, or analysis, they are all the same," which is today's broad sense of book reviews.

My profession is editing books. Every day, I receive newspapers and magazines, and I have the habit of first looking for book review-type articles. Of course, this is also related to my love for reading essays. Perhaps being overly critical is a common ailment among literati, but my feeling is that it is similar to how Montaigne summarized his kissing experience: "It's not worth it, because you have to kiss 50 ugly women to kiss 3 beautiful ones" (from the Danish Dr. Nyrop's "Kissing and Its History").

I have no experience to share about kissing, but my experience with reading book reviews can be summed up with "Premier's Testament," which has already accumulated "forty years." Today, from the "Wenhui Book Review Weekly," I read Yu Xing's article "Again Seeing 'Li Sao'." Yes, I call it an article, not a book review, because it is indeed a good article, one that I think can win first prize in the essay and miscellaneous essay category. Of course, it is also a good book review and should be among Montaigne's top three out of fifty.

The article is not long, and I will quote it in full:

"Reading 'Literary Appreciation Compendium' at night, I see 'Li Sao' again.

During my student days, I once enjoyed 'Li Sao' with great relish. The personality of Qu Yuan came through the colorful lines of poetry, and a real 'restlessness' disturbed my young and tranquil heart, and from then on it was uncontrollable, until now I see 'Li Sao' again.

'Li Sao' is difficult to digest, but it is fragrant beyond compare. 'Li Sao' is immortal, but its readers will not increase in proportion to the population—seeing 'Li Sao' again, I am both happy and worried.

A third-year liberal arts university student has never 'encountered' classics like 'Li Sao' and 'Shijing,' and when he knows that many of Qiong Yao's poems are translations of classical poetry, he is greatly surprised. According to those familiar with university student life, such students who 'know nothing of the Han, let alone the Wei and Jin' are not few. In the campus, you can easily 'catch a handful.'

I say these things without anger or condemnation. In fact, asking university students to read classics like 'Li Sao' and 'Shijing' is indeed not timely. University students, for their future paths, whether going abroad or finding a job, must read some useful books. 'Li Sao' is too far away, and even in the future journey, one may not encounter a superior or colleague who has read 'Li Sao.' This is one reason.

Secondly, classics like 'Li Sao' and 'Shijing' are currently in a 'frozen' state. The lively discussions on traditional culture and modernization tell us what? Do 'Li Sao' and 'Shijing' contain both essence and dross? It is better not to 'touch' them. After all, university students represent the future, and it is crucial not to absorb dross while absorbing the essence, lest one loses one's unique capital—thought liberation—when entering society.

Seeing 'Li Sao' again, I feel it is not timely. Fortunately, the 'aura' produced by 'Li Sao' still surrounds me, with a refreshing fragrance that makes one intoxicated and also makes one solemn. In this winter night with chilling air."

"Again Seeing 'Li Sao'" is a book review, but it is not just a book review. It reviews 'Li Sao': "It is difficult to digest, but it is fragrant beyond compare." No further analysis is needed; it genuinely expresses one's feelings: "The personality of Qu Yuan came through the colorful lines of poetry, and a real 'restlessness' disturbed my young and tranquil heart, and from then on it was uncontrollable..."

It is precisely because of this "uncontrollable" feeling that he wrote "Again Seeing 'Li Sao'." This is certainly not just to review Qu Yuan's work, nor is it just to review books like 'Literary Appreciation Compendium.' He is like Zhang Hua writing "Ode to the Sea," "speaking of the sea from all directions," with the spirit fully in the word "again." Seeing 'Li Sao' again, he is both happy and worried. University students "know nothing of the Han, let alone the Wei and Jin," is it worth worrying about? Or is it worth being happy about? University students "in the future journey may not encounter a superior or colleague who has read 'Li Sao,'" is it worth being happy about? Or is it worth worrying about? He does not force readers to draw conclusions, and I believe the author himself has not yet drawn a conclusion. He is just thinking, and he hopes that readers will also think.

"Again Seeing 'Li Sao'," is this kind of book review really not timely? I put on my clothes and sit up, facing the lonely lamp, in this winter night with chilling air.

### 读《又见〈离骚〉》

　　读《又见〈离骚〉》
    钟叔河
    书评为散文（杂文）文体之一。曾涤生易姚姬传所分文体１３类为１１类，其三即为序跋，定义是“他人之著作序述其意者”，“曰序，曰跋，曰引，曰题，曰读，曰传，曰注，曰笺，曰疏，曰说，曰解皆是”，也就是今天广义的书评了。
    我的职业是编书，每天收到报刊，习惯总是先看看有没有书评类的文章，当然这和自己爱读散文多少也有关系。也许眼高手低确是文人通病罢，我的感觉，简直跟Ｍｏｎｔａｉｇｎｅ总结他的接吻经验差不多，就是——“并不上算，因为须得亲上５０个丑的才能亲到３个美丽的女子”（见丹麦Ｄｒ·ｎｙｒｏｐ著《接吻与其历史》）。
    接吻的经验我无足称述，看书评的经验则可援“总理遗嘱”，已经“积四十年”，今从《文汇读书周报》上，读到了虞星的《又见〈离骚〉》这篇文章。是的，我把它叫做文章，不叫做书评，因为它的确是一篇好文章，是我认为可以在散文杂文中获一等奖的好文章，当然更是一篇好书评，应该属于Ｍｏｎｔａｉｇｎｅ的五十分之三以内的。
    文章不长，全抄如下：
    “夜读《文艺鉴赏大成》，又见《离骚》。
    学生时代我曾苦滋滋地享受过一阵子《离骚》，屈原的人格力量通过那缤纷的诗行向我袭来，一种真实的‘躁动’骚扰了我那年轻而平静的心湖，从此一发而不可收，直至现在我又见《离骚》。
    《离骚》是难啃的，但嚼起来是芬芳无比的。《离骚》是不朽的，但它的读者却是不会与人口同步增长的——又见《离骚》，我既喜又忧。
    一位三年级的文科大学生从未‘碰’过《离骚》、《诗经》之类的经典，当知琼瑶的许多诗是译自古典诗词时竟大为惊讶。据熟悉大学生生活的人士透露，这类‘不知有汉、无论魏晋’的学生并不在少数，在校园里你随手就可‘抓上一大把’。
    我说这些并无愤怒或谴责之意，说实在的，让大学生去念《离骚》、《诗经》之类的经典毕竟是不合时宜的。大学生为了今后的出路，不论是出国之路，还是就业之路，就得读一些有用的书，《离骚》离得太远，即使在未来的旅途上也未必会见到一位读过《离骚》的上司或同僚。此其一。
    其二，《离骚》、《诗经》之类的经典现正处于‘冻结’阶段，轰轰烈烈的传统文化与现代化讨论告诉我们什么？《离骚》、《诗经》之中是否也包含了精华和糟粕？还是不‘碰’为妙，要知道，大学生代表未来，切不可在吸取精华的同时滚上一层糟粕，以至在跨入社会时丧失自己唯一的资本——思想解放。
    又见《离骚》，我自觉不合时宜，好在《离骚》所产生的‘气’场依旧围绕着我，清新的芬芳令人陶醉，也令人凛然，在这寒气袭人的冬夜。”
    《又见离骚》是书评，但又不仅仅是书评。他评《离骚》：“是难啃的，但嚼起来是芬芳无比的”。再不用多作分析，只真实地诉说自我的感受：“屈原的人格力量通过那缤纷的诗行向我袭来，一种真实的躁动骚扰了我那年轻而平静的心湖，从此一发而不可收……”
    正因为“一发而不可收”，他才写《又见〈离骚〉》。这当然不是为了评屈原的作品，恐怕也不仅仅是为了评《文艺鉴赏大成》这类的书。他像张华作《海赋》，“于海之上下四旁言之”，精气神全在“又见”二字上。又见《离骚》，他既喜又忧。大学生“不知有汉，无论魏晋”，是值得忧？还是值得喜？大学生“在未来的旅途上，也未必会见到一位读过《离骚》的上司或同僚”，是值得喜？还是值得忧？他并没有强迫读者作结论，而且我相信作者自己也还没有结论。他只是在思想，而且希望读者也来思想。
    《又见〈离骚〉》，这样的书评，难道真的不合时宜吗？我披衣起坐，面对孤灯，在这寒气袭人的冬夜。
