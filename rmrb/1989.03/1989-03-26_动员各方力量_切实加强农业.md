The agricultural situation is severe, and the contradiction between the supply and demand of grain will exist for a long time. If we cannot achieve a bumper harvest of grain in the next two years and ensure the long-term stable development of agriculture in the future, the consequences will be unthinkable. Our country's agriculture, from resources to technology utilization, has a lot of potential to be tapped. Agriculture can meet the basic needs of the Chinese people. The pessimistic conclusion that our country's grain can only rely on long-term imports is negative and harmful. Ten years of practice has proven that the success of China's rural reforms is not the result of a single measure going deep alone, but the result of comprehensive and coordinated efforts. In the future, we should not rely on a single measure to achieve victory. For agriculture, policies should be tilted, science and technology should be tilted, and investment should be tilted.

In recent years, especially since 1985, China's agricultural development has lagged behind, showing obvious fluctuations and stagnation, becoming a prominent weak link in the national economy, attracting the attention of all sectors.

First of all, whether from the current situation or from the analysis of future development, the situation facing agriculture is quite severe; agriculture has become a major issue related to the survival and development of the nation.

From a long-term perspective, the severe situation in agriculture is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

China's cultivated land area is decreasing year by year. From 1957 to 1988, over 30 years, China's total cultivated land area has decreased by 2.5 billion mu, almost equivalent to the total cultivated land area of Liaoning, Sichuan, and Hebei provinces combined. On average, 80 million mu of land is lost per year, and the per capita cultivated land area has decreased from 2.59 mu to 1.33 mu, nearly halving.

The population has increased significantly. Since the founding of the People's Republic, China's total population has more than doubled, with an average annual increase of about 14 million people. This directly affects the per capita grain availability. In 1984, China's per capita grain production was 392 kilograms, which decreased to 374 kilograms in 1987 and further decreased to 359 kilograms in 1988. By April 1989, the national population will exceed 1.1 billion. If this trend continues, by the end of the century, the population control target may be exceeded, and even ensuring food security will be difficult.

As people's living standards improve, consumption levels rise, and consumption structures change, the demand for grain continues to grow. In 1988, 11 provinces and municipalities, accounting for 36.2% of the population, had grain consumption exceeding 400 kilograms, with Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai reaching 500 kilograms per capita.

From a short-term perspective, the severe situation in agriculture is mainly due to the following reasons: water conservancy facilities are in disrepair, infrastructure is aging, effective irrigated area is decreasing, soil fertility is declining, and the ecological environment is deteriorating; agricultural production materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films are insufficient in quantity and expensive in price, leading to a sharp increase in agricultural production costs; the comparative benefits of grain are low, and farmers' enthusiasm for growing grain is decreasing. During my investigation in Guangdong, farmers reflected that in agriculture, the highest income comes from citrus, lychee, and banana, followed by aquaculture, sugarcane, and peanuts, with the lowest being grain. Even if a mu of rice produces 600 kilograms per year, the net income is only 165 yuan, which is only a fraction or even a few tenths of other industries. In such regions, growing grain has become an uneconomic choice. Additionally, some farmers have a sense of instability and insecurity, fearing policy changes and unwilling to make long-term investments in land. If farmers are unwilling or insecure about growing grain, the problem will be serious.

Due to these reasons, the contradiction between grain supply and demand is quite sharp. In 1953, 21 provinces and regions had a net surplus of grain, but by 1988, only 5 provinces had a net surplus of grain, with the total net import of grain reaching over 150 billion kilograms. Many provinces and regions face grain supply shortages, and market prices have risen significantly. It seems that the contradiction between grain supply and demand will exist for a long time, and grain shortages will be difficult to avoid. If we cannot achieve a bumper harvest of grain in the next two years, increase the production of major agricultural products such as grain, cotton, and oil, and ensure the long-term stable development of agriculture in the future, it will not only directly affect the overall stability and the effectiveness of rectification and governance, as well as the deepening of reforms and social stability, but it will also hinder the long-term stable development of the national economy and even threaten the survival of the nation. In this sense, agriculture is a matter of life and death for the survival and development of our nation.

Secondly, China's agriculture has great potential for development, and the future is bright. Through long-term, unremitting efforts, we can fully rely on existing resources to meet people's basic needs. Pessimism is unfounded.

China's agricultural resources are relatively insufficient, and the per capita level is very low, but the potential is considerable, and there is a way out:

First of all, China still has a large amount of undeveloped agricultural resources that can be utilized. According to incomplete statistics, China currently has about 2 billion mu of uncultivated arable land that can be developed, with a cultivation rate of 75%, which can increase the cultivated land area by 1.5 billion mu. The tidal flat area is about 200 million mu, with most of it still undeveloped and utilized; the freshwater area is 2.5 billion mu, with 750 million mu available for aquaculture, and nearly 40% of the water area is not used for aquaculture; the seawater area available for aquaculture is 7.38 million mu, with the cultivated area accounting for only 1/3. This is a considerable natural resource.

Secondly, the potential for deep development and utilization of already utilized agricultural resources is very broad.

1. Among the current 14.9 billion mu of cultivated land, medium and low-yield fields account for 2/3. From the best grain production situation in 1984, although China's total grain production ranked first in the world, the yield per unit area ranked only 18th. Among them, the total rice production ranked first in the world, but the yield per unit area ranked only 9th; wheat total production ranked first, but the yield per unit area ranked 17th; corn total production ranked second, but the yield per unit area ranked 14th; soybean total production ranked third, but the yield per unit area ranked 16th. If we can increase the yield per unit area of the current medium and low-yield fields by 100 kilograms, then the total grain production will increase by more than 500 billion kilograms. According to the current level of scientific and technological promotion and application, this is not a fantasy.

2. The country has 4.79 billion mu of grasslands, with 3.37 billion mu available for utilization, but only 1.6 billion mu of artificial and improved grasslands, accounting for 4.7% of the total area. Accelerating the improvement of grasslands and the construction of artificial grasslands can further increase the carrying capacity and increase the supply capacity of livestock products.

3. Currently, the effective utilization rate of fertilizers is only 30%, which is only half the average level of developed countries. If we can reach the average level of developed countries, it is equivalent to doubling China's fertilizer supply. In addition, organic fertilizers have been neglected for many years, and attention should be paid to their full utilization.

4. China is a country with scarce water resources, but the effective utilization rate of water for agriculture is only about 40%. How to scientifically and rationally use water, some provinces have created. Promoting these experiences will significantly change the situation of water resource scarcity.

5. The country has 1.5 million agricultural science and technology personnel, but due to various reasons, a considerable number of science and technology personnel have not been fully utilized. Existing agricultural scientific research achievements have not been fully utilized. According to relevant experts' estimates, the role of scientific and technological achievements in agricultural production is currently at most 30% to 40%. The potential here is the greatest. If we can continuously increase the input of science and technology, create conditions, and more fully utilize existing science and technology personnel and scientific and technological achievements, and with the development of high technology, pay attention to the application and promotion of a series of new scientific and technological achievements in the field of biotechnology, then the existing resources will be fully utilized at a higher level and in a broader field, and the supply capacity of agricultural products will undergo a qualitative change.

6. In recent years, although 6 to 7 million laborers are transferred from agriculture to the secondary and tertiary industries each year, agriculture is still one of the industries with the most severe hidden unemployment. How to improve the utilization rate of rural labor resources is a very worthy topic of study. Of course, a part of the surplus labor force in rural areas should be transferred to non-agricultural industries, but there is also room for improvement in the agricultural sector. For example, developing wasteland, developing tidal flat aquaculture, etc. The development of agriculture is the hope for the development of China's agriculture.

Agriculture can meet the basic needs of the Chinese people. In fact, some countries and regions in the world with per capita resources not much higher than ours have already achieved this. Neighboring Japan, with a per capita cultivated land area of only 0.6 mu, half of ours, has self-sufficiency in rice. In 1984, the cultivated land area was 2.315 million hectares, with a yield of 427 kilograms per mu, ensuring the basic needs of the people. The Netherlands, with a per capita cultivated land area of only 0.86 mu, half a mu less than ours, not only meets the needs of the country but also exports a large amount, with agricultural product export value accounting for 22% of the total, becoming the second-largest agricultural product exporter after the United States and France. South Korea, with a per capita cultivated land area of only 0.73 mu, nearly half of ours, achieved a yield of 372.5 kilograms per mu in 1985, with rice basically self-sufficient.

The same is true domestically. In 1987, Zhejiang Province had a per capita cultivated land area of 0.63 mu, less than half the national average, but the per capita grain availability reached 386 kilograms, higher than the national average by 33%, and the supply and demand within the province were basically balanced.

Of course, potential resources do not equal actual agricultural product supply capacity. Talking about the advantages of potential resources is of no use. Whether new resources can be developed, the utilization level of existing resources can be improved, and agricultural productivity can be significantly developed, the key lies in whether a mechanism can be created to mobilize all forces to promote the vigorous development of agriculture. This requires us to continue to deepen rural reforms. Reform is a long-term historical process that cannot be completed in a day or two and is difficult to divide into the first step, second step, etc. We must have a sense of urgency but not be impatient for success. In the next few years, we should, on the basis of stabilizing the household contract responsibility system, gradually rationalize various economic relationships, including the relationship between the central and local governments, the relationship between departments, the relationship between the government and farmers, and the construction of various laws and regulations. In addition, we must strictly control population growth and implement the family planning policy. There are many big things to do here. If we do this, then China will be able to rely on existing resources to meet the basic needs of the people. The pessimistic conclusion that our country's grain can only rely on long-term imports is negative and harmful.

Thirdly, the experience and lessons of rural reforms and development in the past 10 years prove that reforms must be comprehensive and coordinated. In the future, we should continue to follow this path to promote agricultural development, mobilize all forces, and truly strengthen this basic industry.

To study how to develop agriculture and the entire rural economy in the future, we must seriously summarize the experience and lessons of the past 10 years.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, China's rural areas have implemented the household contract responsibility system, which is a major reform of the rural economic system, bringing great vitality to the rural economy and liberating productivity. This reform is successful. However, if we attribute the successful experience of rural reforms in the past 10 years to the household contract responsibility system alone, it is not comprehensive and does not fully reflect the reality, and it is too simplistic. In fact, the success of China's rural reforms in the past 10 years is not the result of a single measure going deep alone, but the result of comprehensive and coordinated efforts, which can be summarized as the household contract responsibility system plus the industrial policy tilting towards agriculture. This may be the essence of the experience of rural reforms, and therefore it has universal significance. The high-speed and comprehensive development of the rural economy and its fluctuations and stagnation are not caused by a single factor. High-speed and comprehensive development is the result of comprehensive and coordinated efforts, and fluctuations and stagnation also have multiple causes. This can be proven from the development process of the past 10 years.

In the past 10 years, it was the best period for China's agricultural development, but within this historical period, agricultural development showed obvious stages.

From 1979 to 1984, all economic indicators in rural areas experienced high-speed and comprehensive growth. In 1984, the total grain production reached 407.3 billion kilograms, an increase of 97.55 billion kilograms compared to 1979, a growth of 32%. Cotton increased by nearly 200%, oil and meat each increased by about 100%. The reason for this is, first of all, the household contract responsibility system stimulated the enthusiasm of the peasants, but this is not the only reason. There were also a series of measures to coordinate with it, including:

Increasing the procurement prices of agricultural and sideline products. Starting from 1979, the state adjusted the procurement prices of agricultural and sideline products many times. Grain prices were increased by 20%, and the additional procurement part was increased by 50%. The procurement prices of 18 other major agricultural and sideline products were increased by 22.1%, and farmers benefited by 12 billion yuan from this. From 1979 to 1984, 30% of the increase in farmers' net income came from this. It can be said that the increased input by the state also brought great benefits to the farmers. This is the care of the Party and the government for the farmers.

The input of agricultural production materials and other material resources increased year by year. In 6 years, the input of fertilizers increased by an average of 11.8% per year, exceeding the annual growth rate of grain production of 5.6%. The amount of fertilizer applied per mu increased from 29.3 kilograms to 51.05 kilograms, nearly doubling. Other agricultural production materials were also basically able to meet the needs.

The investment in agricultural infrastructure basically maintained the corresponding proportion. In 1979, the investment in agricultural infrastructure accounted for 11.1% of the total national infrastructure investment, and in 1980, it accounted for 9.3%. Although it slightly decreased afterwards, it still exceeded 6% before 1984. In the face of tight national finances, this is not a small amount. The agricultural water conservancy facilities formed over the years also played a great role. This provided the necessary material foundation for agricultural development.

The opening of the agricultural market, the expansion of agricultural product circulation channels, and the import of grain also played a role in revitalizing the rural economy and allowing farmers to rest and recuperate.

In addition, the large-scale promotion of agricultural technology also significantly promoted agricultural development and brought benefits to farmers.

However, reforms and development continue to encounter new problems. From 1985 to 1988, agriculture experienced a stage of fluctuations and stagnation. In 1985, the total grain production decreased by 6.9% compared to 1984. Although there was a slight recovery in 1986 and 1987, it never reached the level of 1984, and in 1988, the total grain production decreased by 2.2% again. How do we view these 4 years? I think it cannot be said that this situation is normal and inevitable, but it also cannot be said that the rural economy has stagnated. In fact, the rural economy as a whole is still developing, and some developments are quite fast, such as township enterprises, fruits, aquatic products, livestock, and other economic crops. The total social product, agricultural product value, and farmers' income in rural areas have all increased, with the main problem being the decrease in grain, cotton, and oil production. The reasons for this situation are multifaceted. For example, in recent years, the growth of industry, especially the processing industry, has been too fast. In 1988, the total industrial output value increased by 17.7%, with the processing industry increasing by 23%, while the total agricultural output value only increased by 3.2%, as Comrade Li Peng pointed out in his report: "The economic structure is out of balance, and agricultural development is lagging behind." For example, in the face of the unbalanced development of various industries in rural areas, although some local measures have been taken to address the problem of low comparative benefits of grain, cotton, and oil, such as using industry to support agriculture and using industry to build agriculture, the overall situation has not been fundamentally changed. In addition, the input into agriculture has also decreased. Of course, there are also other reasons such as natural disasters. These lessons should be seriously summarized.

In light of the experience and lessons of the past 10 years, future rural reforms and development must continue to carry out comprehensive and coordinated reforms and take solid and effective measures. We cannot rely on a single measure to achieve victory, as there is no shortcut or trick. This should be the basic approach for China's future rural reforms and development. Now, it seems that there is not much to say about developing agriculture. The people rely on food for their lives, but once they have enough to eat, they easily overlook agriculture. In fact, agriculture is a basic industry that restricts the development of other industries. We need to eat, and we need to promote the development of this basic industry. To increase effective supply, we cannot just solve agricultural problems within agriculture or rural problems within rural areas. We must, in the overall development of the national economy, according to the decision of the State Council on the key points of industrial policy, appropriately tilt towards agriculture from a macro perspective. Policies should be tilted, science and technology should be tilted, and investment should be tilted. We should mobilize all forces to strongly support the production of agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, oil, meat, poultry, eggs, and vegetables.

Last year, the central and state councils held a national rural work conference, proposing to promote agricultural development, with one relying on policies, two relying on science and technology, and three relying on investment. These three are indispensable, which is the comprehensive and coordinated reform and effective measures, and also a summary of the successful experience of the past 10 years. The so-called one relying on policies is to formulate and implement policies that encourage and protect farmers' production enthusiasm and support agricultural development; two relying on science and technology is to do everything possible to mobilize and encourage various scientific and technological forces, maximize the promotion of agricultural practical technologies, and improve the scientific and technological level of agricultural development. Three relying on investment is to increase investment in agriculture in multiple levels and channels. To eat, we need to invest, without investment, there is no output, and without increasing investment, the agriculture of any country cannot develop. In our country, when talking about investment, we should talk about multi-level and multi-channel investment. First of all, we should increase the state's investment in agriculture, secondly, we should increase the local government's investment in agriculture. Thirdly, we should encourage and guide farmers' investment in agriculture. The government should fully play its guiding role and organize various investments to concentrate on agriculture. Various investments should be reasonably divided and coordinated. The state should mainly be responsible for the treatment of major rivers and large-scale agricultural industrial construction, as well as the construction of important agricultural infrastructure. Local governments should mainly be responsible for the construction of regional agricultural infrastructure and agricultural service systems. Farmers should mainly increase their investment in land, including both current production and operation investment and long-term investment and development in land. Farmers are the main channel for increasing investment. Various investments combined, agricultural development will have a reliable material guarantee.

Recently, the State Council issued a decision on the key points of industrial policy, emphasizing the placement of agriculture at the forefront of basic industries, which is an important strategic decision and a rare historical opportunity to accelerate agricultural development. We should seize this opportunity, continue along the effective path of comprehensive reform and coordinated measures, and truly strengthen the basic position of agriculture in the national economy.

Fourthly, the current agricultural production situation is good, but the task of achieving a bumper harvest this year is still quite arduous, and we must redouble our efforts and grasp the implementation.

Last year's national rural work conference did not issue anything surprising, but its guiding ideology, the "three relies" policy, and the ten decisions on achieving a bumper harvest this year were supported and approved by governments at all levels, cadres, and the broad masses of farmers. The series of measures proposed by the conference have already shown initial results, and the agricultural situation has shown signs of improvement. Since last winter and this spring, agriculture has received high attention from leaders at all levels. Each locality has done a lot of work in combination with its actual situation:

The state's investment in agriculture has increased significantly, for example: 1 billion yuan for the land occupation tax, 1 billion yuan from the extra-budgetary adjustment funds for agriculture, 200 million yuan increase in the planned basic construction investment, and bank loans increased to 17.2 billion yuan, an increase of 6.3 billion yuan compared to last year. The total investment in agriculture by local governments has reached the highest level since the 1980s. Hebei, Liaoning, and 18 other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have invested 2.92 billion yuan in agriculture, an increase of 16.8% compared to last year. Jiangsu and 17 other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions plan to invest 73.12 billion yuan in agriculture this year, an increase of 16.9% compared to last year.

The agricultural water conservancy construction in the winter and spring of last year and this year was the best and most extensive in the past 10 years. According to statistics from 24 provinces and regions, the investment in agricultural water conservancy last winter increased by 26.8% compared to the previous year, reaching 1.8 billion yuan. By the end of last December, the country had completed a total of more than 30 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, increased, restored, and improved the irrigated area by more than 40 million mu, reduced the waterlogged area by more than 13 million mu, and treated the soil erosion area and improved the low-yield field project area by more than 24 million mu. At the same time, the use of organic fertilizers was significantly better than in previous years.

Adjusting the procurement prices of grain, cotton, and oil, canceling the "price conversion to market price" for grain, and increasing the fertilizer quota for contracted grain have, to some extent, encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for growing grain and cotton. According to the National Bureau of Statistics' survey of the planting intentions of more than 40,000 households in 8,344 counties in 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the grain planting area this year is expected to increase by 1.2% compared to last year, and the seedling situation is better than in the previous three years. This means that achieving a bumper harvest of grain this year has had a good start.

However, there are still many difficulties and problems: the demand for agricultural production materials is large, the supply is tight, and the implementation is not good. Currently, the operating rate of small fertilizer plants nationwide is only 77%, and the production shortfall in January and February is 25 million tons. The pesticide problem is more prominent. According to the agricultural department's forecast, due to the warm winter last year, the density of overwintering pests and diseases may exceed previous years, and it is estimated that the number of pests, diseases, and rodents that may occur this year may increase. The supply of pesticides is urgent, and if not handled in time, it may bring devastating damage to grain and cotton production. In addition, the agricultural materials department and agricultural industrial production enterprises are severely short of funds, which directly affects the production and supply of agricultural materials. The urgent task and basic guarantee for achieving a bumper harvest this year is to ensure the supply of agricultural production materials. Efforts should be made to improve specialized operations, stabilize prices, and supply in a timely manner, while resolutely cracking down on illegal activities of producing and selling fake and substandard seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. This is also the most urgent requirement and wish of the farmers.

To ensure the production and supply of agricultural production materials, the State Council has held consecutive meetings for research and deployed specific tasks through a national telephone conference. Now, the most important thing is to grasp the implementation, implement it level by level and item by item, and see it through to the end, without delaying the agricultural season. Whether or not agriculture is valued is not about what you say, but about how many practical things you have done and how many difficulties and problems you have solved. Agriculture has a strong seasonality, and when arranging current work, we should always make way for spring plowing.

If we can truly mobilize all forces, appropriately tilt towards agriculture, and solidly do a good job in the current work, achieving a bumper harvest this year is completely possible, and the long-term stable development of agriculture is full of hope.

　　动员各方力量  切实加强农业
    提要：农业形势严峻，粮食供给与需求的矛盾将长期存在，若不能夺取今明两年粮食丰收，并保证今后农业持续稳定发展，后果不堪设想。我国农业从资源到技术利用，都有很大潜力可挖，农业能够满足我国人民的基本需求，那种认为我国粮食只能长期依靠进口的悲观结论是消极的、有害的。１０年的实践证明，中国农村改革的成功决不是某一项措施孤军深入，而是全面配套，综合起作用的结果，今后不能寄希望于某一措施出奇制胜。对农业，政策要倾斜，科技要倾斜，投入要倾斜。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    近些年，特别是１９８５年以来，我国农业发展滞后，出现了明显的波动和徘徊，成为当前国民经济中突出的薄弱环节，引起了各界的关注。
    　　　　一、无论从目前形势观察，还是从未来发展分析，农业面临的形势都是相当严峻的；农业已经成为关系到民族生存与发展的重大问题。
    从长远看，农业形势严峻，突出表现在这样几个方面：
    我国耕地面积逐年减少。从１９５７年到１９８８年的３０年间，我国耕地总面积累计净减少了２．５亿亩，接近于目前辽宁、四川、河北三省耕地面积之总和，平均每年减少８００万亩，人均耕地从２．５９亩减少到１．３３亩，减了近一半。
    人口大幅度增加。建国以来我国总人口已经增长一倍多，平均每年增加１４００万人左右。这直接影响到人均占有粮食水平。１９８４年，我国人均占有粮食产量３９２公斤，１９８７年下降到３７４公斤，１９８８年又减少到３５９公斤。１９８９年４月全国人口将突破１１亿。按着这个速度发展下去，本世纪末可能突破人口控制指标，那时也许保吃饭都很困难。
    随着人民生活的改善、消费水平的提高以及消费结构的变化，人们对粮食的需求还在增长。１９８８年，全国已有１１个省、市３６．２％的人口粮食消费超过４００公斤，其中京、津、沪３大城市人均消费已经达到５００公斤。
    从近期看，农业形势严峻主要是：水利失修，设施老化，有效灌溉面积减少，土壤肥力下降，生态环境恶化；化肥、农药、农膜等农用生产资料数量不足，价格昂贵，农业生产成本急剧上升；粮食比较效益低，农民种粮积极性下降。我在广东调查时，农民反映：在农业中，收入最高的是柑桔、荔枝、香蕉，第二是养鱼，第三是甘蔗，第四是花生，最低是粮食。即使一亩稻谷年产６００公斤，纯收入也只有１６５元，只相当于其他产业的几分之一甚至十几分之一。在这样的地区种植粮食已经成为不经济的选择。此外，在一部分农民中还存在着不稳定、不安全感，怕政策变，不愿意对土地进行长期投入。如果农民都不愿意或不安心于种粮食，那问题就严重了。
    由于这些原因，粮食供给和需求的矛盾相当尖锐。１９５３年，全国净调出粮食的省、区有２１个，到１９８８年，净调出粮食的省只有５个，净调入省的总调入量达１５０多亿公斤。许多省区粮食供应紧张，市场价格大幅度上升。看来，粮食供给与需求的矛盾将长期存在，粮食短缺将是很难避免的。如果我们不能夺取今明两年的粮食丰收，使粮、棉、油等主要农产品产量有较多增加，并保证今后农业持续稳定发展，那么，就不仅直接影响全局的稳定和整顿、治理的效果，以及改革的深入、社会的安定，而且将阻碍国民经济的长期稳定发展，甚至将威胁民族的生存，后果不堪设想。从这个意义上说，农业是关系到我们民族生存与发展的生死攸关的大问题。
    　　　　二、我国农业发展潜力很大，前途光明，经过长期坚持不懈的努力，我们完全有能力依靠现有资源，满足人们的基本需求，悲观是没有根据的。
    我国农业资源相对不足，人均占有水平很低，但潜力是相当大的，并不是没有出路：
    首先，我国尚有大量尚未开发的农业资源可以利用。据不完全统计，我国目前尚未开垦利用的宜农荒地有２亿亩左右，按７５％的开垦率计算，可增加耕地面积１．５亿亩，滩涂面积约２０００万亩，绝大部分尚未开发利用；淡水水面２．５亿亩，可养水面７５００万亩，还有近４０％的水面没有用于养殖；海水可供养殖的水面７３８万亩，已养殖面积只占１／３。这是极为可观的自然资源。
    其次，已经利用的农业资源深度开发利用的前景非常广阔。
    １，在现有的１４．９亿亩耕地中，中低产田占２／３。从粮食生产情况最好的１９８４年看，虽然我国谷物总产量占世界第一位，但单产只排在第１８位。其中，稻谷总产量占世界第１位，单产只排在第９位；小麦总产第１位，单产第１７位；玉米总产第２位，单产第１４位；大豆总产第３位，单产第１６位。如果我们能将现在的中低产田亩产水平提高１００斤，那么粮食总产量将增加５００多亿公斤。根据目前科学技术推广和应用水平，这绝不是幻想。
    ２，全国现有草原４７．９亿亩，其中可利用的面积有３３．７亿亩，但是人工和改良草场仅有１．６亿亩，占总面积的４．７％。加快草场改良和人工草原建设，可以进一步提高载畜量，增加畜产品的供给能力。
    ３，现在化肥有效利用率只有３０％，仅是发达国家平均水平的一半。如果能够达到发达国家的平均水平，那么，等于我国化肥供给总量增加一倍。此外，有机肥多年受到冷落，应注意充分利用。
    ４，我国是水资源缺乏的国家，但目前农业用水的有效利用率仅有４０％左右。怎样科学、合理用水，一些省颇有创造。推广这些经验，将明显改变水资源缺乏的状况。
    ５，全国现有农业科技人员１５０万人，但由于种种原因，相当多的科技人员未能充分发挥作用。现有农业科研成果也没得到充分利用。据有关专家推算，现在科技成果在农产品增产中的作用最多只占３０％到４０％。这里的潜力最大，如果我们能够不断增加科学技术的投入，创造条件，更充分地利用现有科技人员和科技成果，同时随着高科技的发展，注重应用和推广生物工程领域一系列新的科技成果，那么现有资源将在更高层次上，更广阔的领域里，得到充分的利用，农产品供给能力将发生质的变化。
    ６，近年来，尽管每年从农业转移到二、三产业的劳动力达六七百万人，但农业仍然是隐蔽性失业最严重的产业之一。如何提高农村劳动力资源的利用率，是个很值得研究的问题，当然，农村的剩余劳动力要向非农产业转移一部分，但是在农业领域里也可以有所作为的。比如开发荒山、荒坡，发展滩涂养殖等等。开发农业是我国农业发展的希望所在。
    农业满足我国人民的基本需求，是完全可以做到的。事实上，世界上有些人均资源也并不比我们多的国家和地区，已经做到了。和我们邻近的日本，人均占有耕地只有０．６亩，比我们少一半，但是稻米自给有余。１９８４年，耕地面积２３１．５万公顷，亩产高达４２７公斤，保证了国民的基本需求。荷兰，人均耕地只有０．８６亩，比我国平均水平少半亩地，但农产品不仅满足了本国需要，而且大量出口，农产品出口额占全国总额的２２％，成为仅次于美国、法国的农产品出口国。南朝鲜，人均耕地只有０．７３亩，比我们少近一半，１９８５年亩产达到３７２．５公斤，稻米基本自给。
    国外如此，国内亦然，浙江省１９８７年人均占有耕地０．６３亩，不到全国平均水平的一半，但人均占有粮食却达到３８６公斤，高于全国平均水平的３３％，省内供求基本平衡。
    当然，潜在的资源并不等于现实农产品供给能力。津津乐道于潜在资源的优势无补于事。能否开发新的资源，提高现有资源的利用水平，使农业生产力获得长足发展，关键在于能否创造一种动员各方面力量，促进农业生机勃勃发展的充满活力的经济运行机制。这要求我们不断深化农村改革。改革是一个长期的历史过程，不是一朝一夕所能完成的，也很难分清第一步、第二步，我们既要树立紧迫感，又不能急于求成。今后若干年内，要在稳定家庭联产承包责任制的基础上，逐步理顺各种经济关系，包括中央和地方的关系、部门和部门的关系、政府与农民的关系，以及各种法规、制度的建设。另外要严格控制人口增长，贯彻落实计划生育政策。这里有许多大文章可做。如果我们这样做了，那么，中国完全有能力依靠现有资源满足人民的基本需求。那种认为我国粮食只能长期依靠进口的悲观结论，是消极而有害的。
    　　　　三、农村１０年改革与发展的经验教训证明，改革必须综合配套。今后应该继续沿着这个路子，促进农业发展，动员各方面力量，切实把
    　　农业这个基础产业强化起来。
    研究今后农业以至整个农村经济如何发展，必须认真总结前１０年的经验和教训。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，我国农村实行了家庭联产承包责任制，这是农村经济体制上的一次重大变革，它给农村经济带来了极大的活力，生产力获得了大解放，这一改革是成功的。但如果把农村过去十年改革成功经验仅仅归结为家庭联产承包责任制这一点，是不全面的，也不完全符合实际，未免把问题简单化了。实际上，中国农村前１０年改革的成功，决不是某一单项措施的孤军深入，而是全面配套的，是综合起作用的结果，概括起来就是家庭联产承包责任制加产业政策向农业倾斜。这可能是农村改革经验的真谛，因此它才具有普遍意义。农村经济的高速全面发展与波折徘徊，都不是哪一个单一的因素造成的。高速全面发展是综合配套的结果，徘徊波折同样也有多种原因。这可以从过去１０年发展过程中得到证明。
    过去１０年，是我国农业发展最好的一个历史时期，但在这个历史区间，农业发展表现出了明显的阶段性。
    １９７９年到１９８４年，农村各项经济指标全面高速增长。１９８４年粮食总产量达到４０７３亿公斤，比１９７９年增加９７５．５亿公斤，增长３２％。棉花增长近２倍，油料和肉类各增长１倍左右。之所以如此，首先是由于家庭联产承包责任制激发了农民的劳动热情，但这不是唯一原因，还有一系列措施与之配套，这包括：
    提高农副产品收购价格。从１９７９年开始，国家多次调整了农副产品收购价格。粮食提价２０％，在这个基础上超购部分又加价５０％，其他１８种主要农副产品收购价格提高了２２．１％，农民由此获益１２０亿元。从１９７９年到１９８４年，农民纯收入增长部分的３０％是由此得到的。应该说国家增加的投入也给农民带来了巨大利益。这是党和政府对农民的关怀。
    农用生产资料等物质投入逐年增加。６年中，化肥投入量年均增长１１．８％，大于粮食产量年增长５．６％的幅度；亩施肥量由２９．３公斤增加到５１．０５公斤，增长近１倍。其他农用生产资料也基本能够保证需要。
    农业基本建设投资基本保持了相应份额。１９７９年农业基本建设投资占全国基本建设投资总额的１１．１％，１９８０年为９．３％，其后虽略有下降，但到１９８４年之前，也都超过６％。在国家财力紧张的情况下，这也不算少了。多年形成的农田水利设施也发挥了很大作用。这为农业发展提供了必要的物质基础。
    农贸市场的开放，农产品流通渠道的扩大，以及粮食的进口，也起到了搞活农村经济，使农民得以休养生息的作用。
    此外，农业科技的大面积推广，也明显促进了农业的发展，给农民带来了利益。
    但是，改革与发展不断出现新的问题。１９８５年到１９８８年，农业出现了一个阶段的波折和徘徊。１９８５年，粮食总产量比１９８４年下降了６．９％，１９８６年、１９８７年虽然略有回升，但始终没有达到１９８４年水平，１９８８年粮食总产量又下降了２．２％。对这４年怎么看？我认为，不能说这种情况是正常和必然的，但也不能因此就说农村经济停滞了。事实上，这４年农村经济总体上还是发展的，有些发展的还较快，如乡镇企业、水果、水产、畜牧及其他一些经济作物，农村社会总产值、农业产值、农民收入都是提高的，主要问题是粮、棉、油产量下降。造成这种状况的原因是多方面的。比如说：这些年，工业，特别是加工业增长过快，１９８８年工业总产值增长１７．７％，其中，加工业增长２３％，而农业总产值只增长３．２％，正如李鹏同志在报告中所指出的：“经济结构失调，农业发展滞后。”再比如说：在农村诸产业发展很不均衡的情况下，对粮、棉、油比较利益低的问题，虽然也采取了一些局部措施，像以工补农、以工建农等等，但也未从根本上改变局面。还有，对农业的投入也减少了。当然，也有自然灾害等其它方面的原因。这些教训应该认真总结。
    鉴于过去１０年的经验教训，今后农村改革与发展，必须继续进行综合配套改革，采取扎实有力的措施。不能寄希望于选一个什么单一措施，出奇制胜，既没有窍门，也不能取巧。这应该是我国未来农村改革与发展的基本思路。现在看，发展农业，没有多少大道理可讲。民以食为天，说了多少年，可是一旦吃饱了肚子，就容易忽视农业。实际上，农业是制约其他产业发展的一个基础产业，要吃饭，要促进这个基础产业的发展。要增加有效供给，就不能只就农业问题解决农业问题，就农村问题解决农村问题，而必须在整个国民经济发展中，按着国务院关于产业政策要点的决定，从全局上适度向农业倾斜，政策要倾斜，科技要倾斜，投入要倾斜，动员各方面力量，大力支持粮、棉、油、肉、禽、蛋、蔬菜等农副产品生产。
    去年，中央和国务院召开了全国农村工作会议，提出促进农业发展，一靠政策，二靠科技，三靠投入。这三靠缺一不可，这就是综合配套的改革和扎实有效的措施，也是对过去１０年成功经验的概括。所谓一靠政策，就是要制定和实行鼓励、保护农民生产积极性，扶持农业发展的政策；二靠科技，就是要千方百计调动和鼓励各种科技力量，最大限度地推广农业实用技术，提高农业发展的科技水平。三靠投入，就是要多层次、多渠道地增加对农业的投入。要吃饭就要投入，没有投入就没有产出，不增加投入，任何国家的农业都不能发展。在我国讲投入，应该讲多层次、多渠道的投入。首先，要增加国家对农业的投入，其次，要增加地方对农业的投入。第三，要鼓励和引导农民对农业的投入。政府要充分发挥导向作用，组织各种投入向农业集中。各种投入，要合理分工，综合配套。国家主要负责大江大河的治理和大型农用工业建设，以及重要的农业基础设施建设。地方主要负责区域性的农业基础设施建设和农业服务体系的建设。农民应主要增加对土地的投入，既包括当年生产经营性投入，也包括对土地的长期投入和开发。农民是增加投入的主渠道。各种投入汇聚起来，农业发展就有了可靠的物质保证。
    最近，国务院颁布了关于产业政策要点的决定，强调把农业放在基础产业之首，这是一个重要的战略决策，也是加快农业发展的难得历史机遇。我们应该抓住这个机遇，沿着已经实行的有效的综合改革、措施配套的方向前进，切实加强农业在国民经济中的基础地位。
    　　　　四、当前农业生产形势看好，但夺取今年农业丰收任务还是相当艰
    　　巨的，务必加倍努力，狠抓落实。
    去年全国农村工作会议，没有颁布什么惊人的东西，但它的指导思想、“三靠”方针和关于夺取今年农业丰收的十条决定，却受到各级政府、干部和广大农民的拥护和赞成。会议提出的一系列措施，已经初见成效，农业形势出现转机。去冬今春以来，农业得到各级领导的高度重视。各地都结合本地实际做了大量工作：
    国家对农业投入明显增加，比如：耕地占用税１０亿元、预算外调节资金给农业提供１０亿元、计划内基本建设投资增加２亿元，银行贷款增加到１７２亿元，比去年增加６３％。地方对农业投入的资金总额达到８０年代以来的最高水平。河北、辽宁等１８个省、市、自治区财政用于农业的投资达到２９．２亿元，比去年增长１６．８％。江苏等１７个省、市、自治区今年用于农业的贷款预计可达到７３１．２亿元，比去年增长１６．９％。
    去冬今春农田水利建设是近１０年来搞的最好最多的一年。据对２４个省、区的统计，去年冬天对农田水利的投资比上年增长２６．８％，达到１８亿元。截止去年１２月底，全国累计完成土石方３０多亿立方米，新增、恢复和改善灌溉面积４０００多万亩，除涝面积１３００多万亩，治理水土流失面积和改造低产田工程面积２４００多万亩。同时，有机肥的使用也明显好于往年。
    调整粮食、棉花、油脂收购价格，取消粮食“议转平”，增加合同定购粮的化肥挂钩标准，在一定程度上鼓励了农民种粮种棉的积极性。据国家统计局对全国３０个省、区、市的８３４个县，１６３１５个村，４万多农户种植安排的意向调查，１９８９年粮食种植面积安排将比去年增加１．２％，而且各地苗情也好于前三年。这意味着，夺取今年粮食丰收，已有了一个良好开端。
    但是，现在还有相当多的困难和问题：农用生产资料需求量大，供应偏紧，而且落实情况不好。目前，全国小化肥厂，开工率只有７７％，一、二月份欠产２５０万吨。农药问题更加突出。据农业部门预测，由于去年冬季气候偏暖，越冬病虫害密度将超过往年，估计全年将发生的病虫鼠害可能增多。农药供应迫在眉睫，搞得不及时，可能给粮棉生产带来毁灭性打击。此外，农资部门和农用工业生产企业资金严重短缺，也直接影响着农用资料的生产和供应。夺取今年农业丰收的当务之急和基本保证，是抓好农用生产资料的供应。努力搞好专营，稳定价格，及时供应，同时坚决打击制造、贩卖伪劣种子、化肥、农药的违法行为。这也是农民最迫切的要求和愿望。
    为了搞好农用生产资料的生产和供应，国务院连续召开会议，进行研究，并召开全国电话会议进行了具体部署。现在最要紧的是狠抓落实，逐级落实、逐项落实，一抓到底，决不可贻误农时。重视不重视农业，不是听你说的怎样，而是看你办了多少实事，解决了多少困难和问题。农业季节性很强，在安排当前工作的时候，都应为春耕生产让路。
    如果我们能够真正把各方面的力量动员起来，向农业适当倾斜，并且扎扎实实地做好当前工作，夺取今年农业丰收，是完全可能的，农业的长期稳定发展是大有希望的。
