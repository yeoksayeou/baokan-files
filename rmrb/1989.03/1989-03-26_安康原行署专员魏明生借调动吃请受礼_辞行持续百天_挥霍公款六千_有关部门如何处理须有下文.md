Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 25th. (Reporter Wan Wuyi) Before moving to the provincial capital last December, the former head of the Ankang Regional Government, Wei Mingsheng, accepted banquets and gifts from various places. The reporter's investigation confirmed that Wei Mingsheng, during his nearly 100-day "farewell" and "departure" activities, visited over 50 units, receiving gifts or demanding items of 20 different kinds and over 30 pieces. He squandered various expenses (including gifts) amounting to over 6,000 yuan. Local officials dubbed him the "farewell chief" and the "feasting chief."

Wei Mingsheng is currently the deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Economic Commission. As early as around August last year, he had spread the news of his impending transfer in various settings. The reporter's investigation revealed that during his farewell visits, Wei Mingsheng usually had the regional government office call ahead, then he would arrive with his secretary and driver, or sometimes just with his wife. Departments and units under the provincial and regional governments, all eight counties in the region, and notable enterprises—he visited almost all of them for his "farewells." Not only did he indulge in lavish banquets during these farewells, but he also accepted a large number of gifts. According to investigations, these gifts included tea, wood ear mushrooms, dried mushrooms, and other local specialties, as well as daily necessities like rice, cooking oil, cigarettes, and alcohol. There were also high-end bedding, handicrafts, quartz clocks, furniture, rare health products, and more. Wei Mingsheng also had relevant personnel from the regional Chinese medicine hospital obtain an electric massager for him, which the hospital had to purchase and deliver, with the cost listed as hospital expenses for reimbursement.

After officially receiving his transfer order, Wei Mingsheng obtained a vacation voucher from the provincial geological team, taking his wife on a trip to Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, lasting over 30 days. This geological team provided Wei with 1,000 yuan for vacation expenses and fully reimbursed the amount without any tickets. Meanwhile, Wei Mingsheng and his wife submitted various tickets for transportation fees, part of the accommodation fees, luggage handling fees, transit fees, and travel allowances totaling over 1,000 yuan to the regional finance office for reimbursement. According to multiple verifications, the various expenses for entertaining this chief, including the received gifts and demanded items, were mostly paid with public funds.

　　安康原行署专员魏明生借调动吃请受礼        
    辞行持续百天  挥霍公款六千        
    有关部门如何处理须有下文
    新华社西安３月２５日电  （记者万武义）陕西省安康地区原行署专员魏明生在去年底调进省城之前，四处吃请受礼，伸手索要东西。记者调查证实，魏明生在１００天左右的“告别”、“辞行”活动中，先后光临５０多家单位，共接收礼品或伸手要的东西达２０个品种、３０多件。挥霍各种费用（包括礼品）在６０００元以上。当地干部称他为“告别专员”、“吃喝专员”。
    魏明生现任陕西省经委副主任，早在去年８月份左右，他就在不同场合把自己要调离的消息张扬出去。记者追踪调查了解到，魏明生四处告别时，一般先让行署办公室电话通知，然后带着秘书、司机，有时仅带夫人前往。部、省驻安康单位、地区直属的有关系统或部门、全地区８个市县以及稍有名气的企业，他几乎一一登门“告别”。他不仅在“告别”活动中大肆吃喝，而且接受了大量礼物。据查证，这些礼品有茶叶、木耳、香菇等山货土特产品，有大米、食油、烟酒等日常生活用品，还有高档被面、工艺品、石英钟、家具、稀有保健药品等等。魏明生还通过有关人向地区中医医院索要电动按摩器，这家医院只得派专人购回送他，其款列入住院费报销了。
    魏明生正式接到调令之后，在省地质一队搞到了疗养指标，带着夫人到武汉、广州、深圳兜了一大圈，历时３０多天。这家地质队给魏汇去１０００元疗养费，并在没有任何票证的情况下将此款全部核销。与此同时，魏明生夫妇又把疗养期间的交通费、部分住宿费、行李托运费、过境费，以及差旅补助费等１０００多元的各种票证，统统在行署财务科报销。根据多方查证，各单位招待这位专员的各种费用，包括受礼索要的物品，大都是以公款支付的。
