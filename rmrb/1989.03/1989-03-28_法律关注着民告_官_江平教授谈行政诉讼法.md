The draft of the Administrative Litigation Law was submitted to the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress for review, sparking heated discussions among the deputies. Many deputies believe that this is a brilliant chapter in China's democratic political construction and should be highlighted. Some deputies, however, are not convinced of the need for this law, while others are concerned that the enactment and implementation of the Administrative Litigation Law will bring disaster to government work. Recently, a reporter discussed several issues of concern to everyone with Jiang Ping, a deputy to the National People's Congress, vice chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress, head of the Administrative Legislation Research Group, and president of the China University of Political Science and Law.

Citizens Suing "Officials" Requires Legal Regulation

Professor Jiang Ping took out two letters of complaint from the public: one from Jiangxi, stating that the local public security bureau had detained his father and son without cause; another from the Northeast, complaining that the local government had illegally seized his family's property. Jiang Ping said that he had received many such letters, but he really had no way to handle them. Should he forward them to the letters and visits department? The complainants had already stated that their letters had been ignored; should he forward them to the court? The court would have every reason to turn them away; should he forward them to the supervision department, but the case had not yet reached the level of being handled by the supervision department; if he forwarded them to their superior departments, the complainants had already tried that, and some had been ignored, while others had even handed the letters back to the original handling agency.

When citizens' personal rights and property rights are infringed upon by administrative organs and their staff, there is no avenue for appeal or complaint. Jiang Ping analyzed the reasons, stating that although China already has more than 130 laws and administrative regulations stipulating that one can sue in court, without a unified basic law, many cases are difficult to determine whether they can be sued in court, and some cases, even if accepted by the court, lack procedural laws to follow. He said that to change this situation and truly protect the rights of citizens to petition, accuse, and expose wrongdoings as stipulated in the Constitution, it is necessary to promulgate the Administrative Litigation Law.

For Clean Governance, Legislation Must Be Based on Law

In administrative litigation activities, government agencies will always be in the position of the defendant and bear the burden of proof. In this sense, the promulgation and implementation of the Administrative Litigation Law indeed adds difficulty to government work. However, Professor Jiang Ping believes that legislation based on law and administrative actions based on law should be the basic guarantee for the honesty and integrity of administrative organs and their staff. If various government departments and administrative organs are allowed to make regulations without legal constraints and can arbitrarily infringe upon the rights and interests of citizens and organizations, what rule of law can there be? He said that the court will protect the correct decisions of various levels of government according to law, and for the wrong decisions of various levels of government, after the court's trial, timely corrections will be made, truly maintaining the authority of various levels of government. With the supervision of hundreds of millions of people, various levels of government can greatly reduce corruption.

Jiang Ping introduced that in the administrative litigation laws of various countries, the general public is the plaintiff, and government agencies are the defendant, because government agencies have coercive power, while the general public does not. Compared with the administrative litigation laws of various countries, the scope of cases accepted by China's draft Administrative Litigation Law is relatively narrow, which is considered based on China's current actual situation. He believes that the urgent task for government agencies and their staff is to establish the concept of the rule of law, ensuring that when making normative documents, they first consider whether these regulations and systems are legal; when making administrative decisions, they have legal basis; and when executing administrative affairs, they strictly act according to law.

　　法律关注着民告“官”        
    ——江平教授谈行政诉讼法
    本报记者  潘岗
    行政诉讼法草案提交七届人大二次会议审议，引起了代表们的热烈讨论。许多代表认为，这是我国民主政治建设的光辉一页，应当大书特书，也有些代表对制定此法不以为然，还有些代表担心，行政诉讼法的颁布实施，会给政府工作带来灾难。日前，记者就大家关注的几个问题，访问了人大代表、全国人大法律委员会副主任委员兼行政立法研究小组组长、中国政法大学校长江平教授。
    　　　民告“官”需要法律规范
    江平教授拿出两封群众申诉信：一封来自江西，称当地公安派出所将其父子无故收审；一封来自东北，告当地政府非法没收其家庭财产。江平说，像这样的信件，他收到了不少，可自己实在无法处理。转到信访部门？来信者有言在先：他寄去的信都石沉大海；转到法院？法院完全有理由推出门外；想交监察部门，可案情还未到监察部门处理的程度；如果转给其上级部门，当事人已先有“尝试”，有的推诿不办，有的甚至将信件交到原处理机关手里。
    公民的人身权、财产权受到行政机关及其工作人员侵犯后，上告无门，投诉无路。江平分析其原因是，虽然我国已有１３０多条法律、行政法规规定了可以到法院告，但由于没有一个全国统一的基本法，使许多案件难以确定能否告到法院，有些案件法院受理后，也在程序上无法可循。他说，要改变这种状况，使宪法赋予公民的申诉权、控告权、检举权真正得到保护，就必须颁布行政诉讼法。
    　　　　为政清廉先得“立法有据”
    行政诉讼活动中，政府机关将时刻处于被告地位，履行其举证责任。从这个意义上说，行政诉讼法的颁布实施，确实给政府工作增加了难度。但江平教授认为，立法有据、依法行政应是保证行政机关及其工作人员清正廉洁的基本前提。假如允许各个政府部门、行政机关制定规章不受法律制约，对公民和组织的权益可以任意侵犯，那还有什么法制可言？他说，对各级政府正确的决定，法院会依法保护，对各级政府错误的决定，经法院审理，及时予以纠正，才能真正维护各级政府的权威。有了亿万群众的监督，才可以大大减少各级政府的腐败现象。
    江平介绍说，世界各国的行政诉讼法，都是将老百姓作为原告，政府机关作为被告，原因是政府机关拥有强制权力，而老百姓则没有。与各国行政诉讼法比起来，我国行政诉讼法草案的收案面是比较窄的，这是考虑到我国目前的实际情况。他认为，政府机关及其工作人员的当务之急是，要树立法制观念，做到在作出规范性文件时，首先要考虑这些规章制度是否合法；在作出行政决定时，要做到有法律依据；在执行政务时，要严格依法办事。
