Last year, our region saw 35 incidents of assaults on commercial administrative personnel, with less than one-third of these cases being resolved. In October of last year, four market management officers from the Yucheng County Commercial Bureau—Yin Wenliang, Xiu Weiguo, and two others—were assaulted while maintaining order in the market. An individual vendor not only refused to comply with management but also rallied relatives and friends to attack them.

In February of last year, Ma Yongli, an officer from the Dahu Commercial Bureau in Yucheng County, was seriously injured when a vendor, who was found to be illegally transporting pork without a license, suddenly started his vehicle and hit Ma.

Additionally, incidents of broken windows and damaged market facilities have occurred frequently.

Worth noting is that some leaders of certain units have also instigated trouble. In February of last year, the Commercial Bureau of a certain county seized an illegally purchased old Crown car from the county's Material Bureau. The leaders of the Material Bureau harbored resentment over this. On July 13th of last year, the director and the secretary of the disciplinary committee of the Material Bureau went to the Commercial Bureau headquarters to cause a disturbance, verbally abusing the commercial administrative personnel with unprintable language.

Some places treat serious disruptions of commercial administrative personnel's duties and injuries to them as mere civil disputes. In November of last year, Hu Guojian, a market management officer from the Chengguan Sub-bureau of a certain county's Commercial Bureau, was severely injured while lawfully inspecting the business license of an individual vendor named Liu. Two months later, the assailant had still not been punished. We hope that relevant departments will severely punish lawbreakers by law and protect the legitimate rights of commercial administrative personnel.

　　依法保护工商行政管理人员
    去年，我地区发生３５起侵害工商行政管理人员的案件，已处理的不到１／３。去年１０月，虞城县工商局市管员尹文良、修卫国等４人在维持市场秩序时，一个体摊贩不但不服从管理，而且还纠集亲友，对他们大打出手。去年２月，虞城县大候工商所干部马永利在检查中，发现一个体户无证贩运猪肉，正处理时，这个商贩突然启动车辆将马永利撞成重伤。另外，一些工商所门窗玻璃被砸、市场设施被毁的事件也时有发生。
    值得重视的是，有些单位的领导人竟也带头闹事。去年２月，某县工商局查获本县物资局非法购进一辆旧皇冠牌小轿车，依法予以没收。县物资局领导人对此耿耿于怀。去年７月１３日下午，县物资局局长和局纪委书记到县工商局机关大吵大闹，辱骂工商行政管理人员，语言不堪入耳。
    有些地方把严重妨害工商行政管理人员执行公务、伤害工商行政管理人员的行为，仅仅当做民事纠纷来处理。去年１１月，某县工商局城关一所市管员胡国建依法检查个体户刘某的营业执照时，被打成重伤。两个多月，打人者还得不到处理。希望有关部门依法严惩违法者，保护工商行政管理人员的合法权益。
