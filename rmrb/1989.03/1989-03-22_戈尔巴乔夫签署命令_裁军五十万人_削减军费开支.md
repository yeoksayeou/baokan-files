Gorbachev Issues Order to Reduce Military by 500,000 and Cut Military Spending

New China News Agency, Moscow, March 21: The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev, signed an order today to reduce the Soviet military by 500,000 personnel and to cut military spending for 1989-1990.

The order states that during the period from 1989 to 1990, the Soviet Union will reduce its military personnel by 500,000, simultaneously reduce the number of conventional weapons, and decrease military expenditures according to the state budget.

The order requires local soviets to take necessary measures to settle officers, warrant officers, and soldiers who have served beyond their term and are transferred to the reserve or retired due to this reduction, ensuring they have housing.

In explaining the unilateral reduction of 500,000 Soviet military personnel and the reduction in military spending, Gorbachev's signed order states that this is to align with the Soviet Union's new military theory and to ensure that the Soviet Union's defense capabilities remain at a reasonable and sufficiently reliable level.

    裁军五十万人        
    削减军费开支
    新华社莫斯科３月２１日电  苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席戈尔巴乔夫今天签署了裁军５０万和削减１９８９—１９９０年军费开支的命令。
    命令说，１９８９年至１９９０年期间将削减苏联军队５０万人，同时削减常规武器数量，并根据国家预算减少军事费用开支。
    命令要求地方苏维埃采取必要措施，安置因这次裁军而转入预备役或退役的军官、准尉和超期服役的士兵，保障他们有房可住。
    戈尔巴乔夫签署的命令在解释苏联单方面裁军５０万人和减少军费时说，这是为了同苏联新的军事理论相适应，也是为了使苏联的国防能力保持在合理和足够可靠的水平上。
