There is often a gap between the technological development departments and the technical application departments, which affects the use and promotion of new technologies. How to bridge this gap while developing technology, communicate with users, and accelerate the improvement and optimization of high-tech products is a problem that many technological development departments have not fully addressed.

In recent years, a notable computer data processing and editing typesetting service organization has emerged in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. This is the demonstration service station for computer laser typesetting established by Sichuan Huaxia Information Engineering Company. It stands out among many electronic typesetting systems with its high-quality service. As early as 1987, the company, with the goal of "providing first-class information services to society," developed computer laser typesetting software and promoted it to the printing industry. At that time, the Sichuan region was not familiar with this new technology, so the company first held a series of technical lectures, product exhibitions, operation demonstrations, and training classes, gradually making people understand and accept this new technology. However, they found during promotion that those who work with computers do not understand printing, and those who work in printing are not familiar with computers, causing difficulties and deficiencies in the use and functionality of the typesetting software. Meanwhile, the old printing process and management methods were no longer applicable, and the new technology could not fully play its advantages. To bridge the gap between development and use, they established the Huaxia Computer Laser Typesetting Demonstration Service Station at the end of the previous year.

The station integrates demonstration, training, development, and production, actively doing good after-sales service work. Over the past year, they have trained 56 computer operators for users; provided on-site guidance to users an average of twice a month; held 5 free user training classes; and solved dozens of problems related to Huaxia typesetting software and other typesetting systems for users...

The demonstration station has played a promotional role in the improvement and redevelopment of Huaxia laser typesetting software. On one hand, problems in the software are promptly discovered and reflected to the development experts for resolution; on the other hand, malfunctions caused by users' unfamiliarity with the software can be solved in a short time at the demonstration station, and users' operators can receive supplementary training at any time.

During the use of this software, Sichuan Agricultural University encountered issues with sorting mathematical formula manuscripts and poor printing quality. The operators brought the sorted files to the demonstration station, and the problem was resolved in one day. The Huaxia Company's visiting service team went to the university, found that the printing method was incorrect, and after correction, the printing quality improved immediately.

After using the typesetting software, users in the Chengdu area found that some fine lines broke during printing. The demonstration station analyzed that the original font library of the typesetting system had quality issues. Therefore, the demonstration station arranged for staff to work overtime, investing nearly 300 man-hours to improve the font library, ensuring the normal use of the software system.

During the use of the software, the Sichuan Provincial Forestry Bureau Printing Plant raised many professional technical issues. After repeated experiments, the company's technical personnel finally tapped the potential of the original software, creating a table that can insert any mathematical formula, which was well received by users.

In addition to setting up the demonstration station to serve users at any time, Sichuan Huaxia Information Engineering Company also publishes advertisements in various media, actively contacts users, and continuously conducts training and equipment maintenance and repair visits. These practical after-sales services have further optimized the company's high-tech products. They said: "China does not have too many computers, but the computers are not well utilized. We are here to serve everyone to better use this high-tech product."

　　高技术产品的售后服务
    ——四川一家科技实体的实践与启示
    本报记者  马在新
    科技开发部门与技术使用部门常常存在着行业差距，这一差距影响着新技术的使用及推广普及。如何能在科技开发的同时，沟通与用户的联系，加快高技术产品的完善和优化，这是众多科技开发部门尚未充分注意的问题。
    在四川省成都市，近年来出现了一个颇为引人注目的计算机数据处理和编辑排版服务机构，这就是四川省华夏信息工程公司创立的电脑激光排版示范服务站。它以优质服务使华夏电脑激光照排系统在众多电子排版系统中独树一帜。早在１９８７年，该公司以“为社会提供第一流的信息服务”为宗旨，开发了电脑激光照排软件，向印刷等行业推广。当时四川地区对这一新技术尚不理解，该公司就首先举办了一系列技术讲座、产品展示、操作表演和培训班，使人们逐渐认识并接受了这一新技术。但是，他们在推广中发现，搞计算机的不懂印刷，搞印刷的对计算机外行，造成排版软件使用上的困难和功能上的欠缺。同时，旧的印刷工艺流程及管理办法不适用了，新技术难以发挥全部优势。为了弥合研制与使用间的距离，他们于前年底建立起华夏电脑激光排版示范服务站。
    该站集示范、培训、开发、生产于一身，积极做好售后服务工作。一年来，他们为用户培训电脑操作人员５６名；平均每月两次上门指导用户操作；免费举办用户培训班５次；为用户解决华夏排版软件及其他排版系统的问题数十个……
    示范站对华夏激光照排软件的完善和再开发起到了促进作用。一方面软件中的问题及时发现并反映到开发专家那里加以解决；另一方面，由于用户对软件掌握不熟悉而发生的故障，均可短期内在示范站得到解决，用户的操作人员随时可以受到补充培训。
    四川农业大学在使用该软件过程中，一些数学公式文稿排不出，印刷质量也不高，操作人员将编排的文件带到示范站来，一天就将问题解决。华夏公司的随访服务队又到农大，了解到该校印刷方法不对，经纠正，印刷质量即刻提高。
    成都地区用户在使用照排软件后，发现印刷时有的细线发生断线，经示范站分析，是照排系统原字库存在质量问题。于是，示范站安排人员加班加点，投入近３００个工时，修整了字库，保证软件系统正常使用。
    四川省林业厅印刷厂在使用软件中，提出了许多专业技术问题。公司技术人员经反复试验，终于挖掘出原有软件的潜力，制作出了可以装入任意数学公式的表格，受到用户的欢迎。
    四川省华夏信息工程公司除了设立示范站随时为用户服务外，还在多种媒介上刊登广告，主动与用户联系，长期不间断地开展培训和设备保养维修的随访。这些切实的售后服务使该公司的高技术产品进一步优化。他们说：“中国的计算机不是太多，而是没有很好地把计算机运用起来，我们就是要为大家更好地使用这项高技术产品服务。”
