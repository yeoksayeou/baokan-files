Genoa Port handles over 6,000 ships annually from nearly seventy countries and regions, with a throughput of 460 million tons. However, prior to 1983, this "giant" incurred an annual deficit of 100 billion lire, accumulating a debt of 500 billion lire. Starting in 1984, Genoa Port underwent comprehensive adjustments and reforms, achieving a turnaround from loss to profit in just three years.

First, the port layout was adjusted. Before the adjustment, Genoa Port had docks, equipment, and warehouses from various historical periods coexisting, with city and port facilities and transportation intertwined, resulting in a chaotic port layout that could not adapt to the development of shipbuilding, commodity handling, storage, and port management. The new layout, on the other hand, concentrates operations by type and, based on principles of convenience for sea, land, and air transport and economic efficiency, divides the entire port into several container, bulk cargo, special commodity transport areas, and general bulk cargo transport areas. The new layout has been basically completed and is beginning to show its superiority.

Next, the organization was adjusted, transforming the "iron rice bowl" into a joint-stock company. Before the adjustment, Genoa Port was entirely managed by the "Genoa Port Consortium," with labor organization stuck at the pre-industrialization level, outdated regulations, unclear responsibilities, low professional standards, and no reward system. After the adjustment, the structure is divided into three levels. The first level is the port's administrative leadership, responsible for formulating the entire port's plan and ensuring and supervising its implementation. The second level is the newly established "Genoa Port Joint-Stock Company," the port's operational management body, responsible for coordinating the entire port's operations. The third level consists of subsidiaries of the "Genoa Port Joint-Stock Company," such as the container transport company, general cargo transport company, oil port joint-stock company, and airport joint-stock company. These companies are both administrative departments and operate independently with economic accounting. Thus, the port has transformed from a "public agency" into a new system structured like a private enterprise, composed of relatively independent joint-stock companies. In these companies, the Genoa Port Consortium, as the largest shareholder, holds control, while other individuals and port labor organizations can also invest.

Third, personnel were streamlined, significantly reducing costs. The port mainly encouraged early retirement to reduce personnel significantly. In 1988, the port had 9,000 employees, now reduced to 3,400, with plans to further reduce to 3,000. Labor costs, which originally accounted for 92% of service prices, have now dropped to 57%. The method of encouraging early retirement is as follows: Consortium employees with 20 years of service and port joint-stock company employees with 27 years or more can apply for early retirement, with their retirement benefits calculated by adding eight years of service. Thus, early retirees can receive retirement benefits close to their salaries, in addition to receiving a severance payment of 700 million to 800 million lire. Consequently, those who meet the conditions have applied for early retirement. These individuals, with an average age of less than 50, can mostly find other jobs after retirement.

Due to the adoption of the above measures and the use of modern tools and computers, the port's work efficiency has significantly improved, and economic benefits have been notably enhanced. In 1987, the port achieved a balanced budget with a slight surplus. In 1988, the profit was approximately 8 billion lire, and the profit for 1989 is expected to reach 20 billion lire.

　　热那亚港的翻身仗
    本报记者  罗晋标
    热那亚港每年接纳来自世界近七十个国家和地区的六千多条轮船，吞吐量达四百六十万吨。然而，在一九八三年之前，这个“庞然大物”每年亏空一千亿里拉，累计债务五千亿里拉。自一九八四年起，热那亚港进行了全面的调整改革，三年打了个扭亏为盈的翻身仗。
    首先是调整港口布局。调整前的热那亚港，各个历史时期的码头、设备、仓库并存，城市与港区的设施和交通交错，港区布局混乱，无法适应造船、商品搬运存放和港口经营管理的发展。新的布局则将作业分类集中，并从方便海陆空联运、讲究经济效益等原则出发，把全港重新划分为若干集装箱、散装货特殊商品运输区和普通散装货运输区。新的布局已基本完成并开始显示出优越性。
    其次，调整组织，变“大锅饭”为股份公司。调整前的热那亚港，一切均由“热那亚港康采恩”包办，劳动组织停留在工业化前水平，法规过时，职责不明，职业水平低，没有奖励制度。调整后的机构分三级。第一级是港口的行政领导，负责制定全港计划并保证和监督其实施。第二级是新成立的“热那亚港股份公司”，是港口的经营管理机构，负责协调全港的运转。第三级是“热那亚港股份公司”的子公司，如集装箱运输公司、普通货物运输公司、石油港股份公司、机场股份公司等。它们既是行政部门，又实行独立经济核算。这样，港口就从“公共机关”变成了一种按私营企业结构建立、由相对独立的股份公司组成的新体制。在这些公司中，热那亚港康采恩作为最大股东而拥有控制权，其他私人和港口劳动者团体均可入股。
    第三是精简人员，大幅度降低成本。港口主要通过鼓励提前退休的办法大量精简人员。一九八八年，全港职工九千人，目前仅为三千四百人，计划还要减到三千人，劳动力费用原来占服务价格的百分之九十二，现在已降为百分之五十七。鼓励提前退休的办法是：康采恩职工工龄２０年、港口股份公司职工工龄二十七年以上者，均可申请提前退休，计算其退休金时，加奖八年工龄。这样，提前退休者可获得接近工资的退休金，此外，还可领到七千万至八千万里拉的退职金。于是符合条件者纷纷申请提前退休。这些人平均年龄不到五十岁，退休后大多还能找到别的工作。
    由于采取了上述措施，并且使用了现代化工具和电子计算机，港口的工作效率大大提高，经济效益显著改善，一九八七年收支平衡，略有盈余。一九八八年约有八十亿里拉左右的盈利，一九八九年的盈利预计将达二百亿里拉。
