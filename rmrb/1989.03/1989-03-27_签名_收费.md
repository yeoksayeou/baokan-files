On the morning of the 25th, Premier Li Peng attended a small group discussion with the Liaoning delegation of the National People's Congress. As soon as he sat down, several representatives took out their notebooks and first-day covers, asking Premier Li Peng for his signature. Li Peng happily obliged. Unexpectedly, more and more people began to ask for signatures, surrounding Premier Li Peng. Li Peng jokingly said, "If I sign any more, I'll have to charge a fee." The room erupted in laughter.

　　签名“收费”
    ２５日上午，李鹏总理参加人大辽宁代表团的小组讨论。入座甫定，不少代表拿出笔记本、首日封要求李鹏总理签名，李鹏欣然从命。不料这一来，要求签名的人越来越多，将李鹏总理团团围住。李鹏开玩笑地说：“再签我可要收费了。”举座哈哈大笑。
