Title: Let Youth Shine on the Ice - A Record of Speed Skater Guo Hongru

At the recently concluded Sofia Winter Universiade, Guo Hongru, a rising star in China's speed skating world, won three medals, drawing widespread attention.

When the dream of winning the championship came true after a few years, Guo Hongru felt a sense of unease instead of joy. She did not dare to revel in her victory; at this moment, she thought more about how to reach even greater heights.

She was well aware that China has a wealth of short-track speed skating talents. Last year, it was Li Jinyan who shone, and the year before that, it was Li Yan who dominated in Calgary. Although she made her international debut this year and achieved remarkable success, she wondered if she too might have a day like the others, where she would fade like a shooting star.

The Guo Hongru sitting in front of me has a round face, bright and black eyes, and a straightforward manner of speaking, all of which reveal the charm of a northeastern girl. She said that out of the seven children in her family, three are involved in speed skating, and no one expected that the most successful one would be her.

In 1980, at the age of 10, Guo Hongru was influenced by her sister, who was in the August First Sports Team, and entered the Hunjiang District Amateur Sports School to learn long-track speed skating. She trained for seven years, but her performance was mediocre. She watched as one after another of her peers left her behind, joining elite sports teams, while she, at the age of 17, was overlooked. At this age, she was considered an "old-timer" in the amateur sports school, and Guo Hongru could not help but feel that the twilight of her athletic career was approaching.

She was lucky. Just as she was about to "hang up her skates," Jilin Province was expanding its team for the National Games, and Guo Hongru got a "bargain," finally wearing the uniform of an elite sports team. Before she had a chance to shine, she was noticed by national team coach Xin Qingshan and received meticulous training. Her potential was fully unleashed by Coach Xin, and in less than half a year, her skating skills and physical abilities went from being the last in the team to the first.

Guo Hongru is now 20 years old, in the prime of her youth. But for the sake of short-track speed skating, she spends most of her time in the Beijing Sports Hall, year-round, with the ice rink as her companion. The joy of breaking records is accompanied by the monotony of life. Fortunately, she has been away from home since she was young and has developed a habit of adapting to any situation. More importantly, compared to success in her career, everything else seems insignificant.

On April 2, Guo Hongru will once again travel with her teammates to Britain to participate in the World Championships. She told me that the world's top athletes will all be competing, and if she can win a gold medal in this competition, then she will truly be a world champion.

### 让青春在冰上闪光——记速滑选手郭洪茹

　　让青春在冰上闪光        
    ——记速滑选手郭洪茹
    在刚刚结束的索非亚冬季世界大学生运动会上，郭洪茹，这颗我国速滑界的新星，一举夺得三枚奖牌，令人为之瞩目。
    几年的冠军梦果真成为事实时，郭洪茹心里反倒生出一种不安。她不敢恋恋于她的胜利，此时此刻她想得更多的是如何更上一层楼。
    她很清楚，我国短跑道速滑人才济济，前年是李金艳出风头，去年是李琰扬威卡尔加里，今年虽然她首次出国征战，便一鸣惊人，可自己会不会也有像其他几人似流星陨落的那一天呢？
    坐在我面前的郭洪茹，圆圆的脸蛋，一对又亮又黑的眼珠，还有那率直的语言，都透露出东北姑娘的风韵。她说她们家七个孩子中有３个搞速滑，谁也没想到最有出息的是她。
    １９８０年，１０岁的郭洪茹受在八一队的姐姐影响，进入浑江地区业余体校学习大跑道速滑，一练就是７年。这期间，她表现平平，眼看一个个小伙伴离她远去，升入优秀运动队，而１７岁的她却无人问津。要知道，这个年龄属于业余体校的“大龄青年”，郭洪茹不能不意识到运动生命的黄昏临近。
    她运气好，就在即将“挂鞋”之际，当时吉林省为准备全运会扩充队伍，郭洪茹捡了个“便宜”，终于穿上优秀运动队队服。在她尚未冒尖时又被国家队教练辛庆山看中，并得到精心培养。她的潜在能量被辛教练淋漓尽致地调动出来，不到半年，她的滑冰技术和各项身体素质由队里的老末跃居第一。
    ２０岁的郭洪茹正是如花似玉的年华，可为了这短跑道，她一年四季的大部分时间憋在首都体育馆，大部分时光与冰场为伴，成绩突破的欢乐与生活单调的无聊兼而有之。好在她从小离家在外，养成随遇而安的习惯，更主要的还是比起事业上的成功，其他一切都显得微不足道。
    ４月２日，郭洪茹又将与队友一起赴英国参加世界锦标赛，她对我说，世界优秀选手都将参赛，如能夺取这次比赛的金牌，才算是真正的世界冠军。
