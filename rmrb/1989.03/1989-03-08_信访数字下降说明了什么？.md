In recent years, the number of letters and visits from the public regarding exposing and reporting issues in our province has decreased compared to the past. Some units have even had no letters or visits from the public recently. I believe that the reason for this situation is not entirely due to the fact that all levels of leadership have been able to act impartially, uphold discipline and the law, and serve the public with integrity, so that the public is content and has no complaints to report to the relevant departments.

From the information held by the discipline inspection and supervision departments, it is known that some units still have issues with improper conduct, and in some cases, these issues are quite serious. So, why has the number of letters and visits regarding exposing and reporting issues decreased?

According to what I have learned, there are several reasons for this:

1. Some units do not have a designated person to handle letters and visits, and even those who are responsible on a part-time basis are not clearly defined. Whoever encounters the issue handles it, and they do not take the problems reflected in the letters and visits seriously. Some of those who are exposed and reported even retaliate against those who write letters or visit, causing those who reflect on the problems to lose heart.

2. Some units have improper conduct that is being addressed but continues to occur, and in some cases, it has even gotten out of control. The public's suggestions are not effective.

3. Some members of the public have lost confidence in rectifying improper conduct and no longer want to report the situation to the relevant departments.

Regarding the factors that have led to the decrease in the number of letters and visits regarding exposing and reporting issues, the relevant departments should pay high attention. For the actual existing issues of improper conduct, they should encourage and support the public to actively expose and report. For the letters and visits from the public, they must ensure that each one has a follow-up, each issue is addressed, and each matter is explained. What should be particularly emphasized is that they must not leave any aftereffects for those who truthfully reflect on the situation. Once it is discovered that there are people and incidents of retaliation against those who expose and report, they should be dealt with seriously according to party discipline and state laws.

### 信访数字下降说明了什么？

　　信访数字下降说明了什么？
    浙江省委办公厅  朱发祥
    近年来，我省在揭发检举方面的群众来信来访的数量比过去下降了，有的单位近期甚至没有群众来信来访。我认为，出现这种情况的原因，并不完全是在于各级领导干部都能秉公办事，遵纪守法，廉洁奉公，群众心平气顺，没有什么意见要向有关部门反映了。
    从纪检和监察部门掌握的情况看，一些单位不仅仍然存在不正之风，有的甚至还比较严重。那么，揭发检举方面的信访数字为什么会下降呢？
    据了解，有以下几个原因：一是有些单位的信访工作没有专人管，连兼职的人也不明确，谁碰上谁处理，对来信来访中反映的问题，不认真负责处理。有的被检举揭发者反而对写信、上访者打击报复，使反映问题的人寒了心。二是有的单位的不正之风，边整边犯，甚至已到失控地步，群众提了意见不管用。三是有些群众对纠正不正之风失去信心，不想再向有关部门反映情况了。
    对于导致揭发检举方面的信访数量下降的几种因素，有关部门应该高度重视。对确实存在的不正之风问题，应当鼓励和支持群众积极揭发举报。对群众来信来访，一定要做到件件有着落，条条有处理，事事有交待。特别应该重视的是，千万不要给如实反映情况的人留下后患，一旦发现对揭发检举的群众施行打击报复的人和事，要按照党纪国法严肃处理。
