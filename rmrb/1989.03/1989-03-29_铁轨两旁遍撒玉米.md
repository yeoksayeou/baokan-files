On February 16, I took the 346th train from Jilin Tonghua to Changchun. After the train passed the Siping station, I noticed that both sides of the tracks were covered with a layer of yellowish corn, about one and a half meters wide. This "corn path" continued all the way to the Changchun station without interruption. This is likely due to corn falling from a grain transport car. Passengers on the train were all pained to see this.

　　铁轨两旁遍撒玉米
    ２月１６日，我乘坐吉林通化至长春的３４６次列车去长春。列车过了四平站后，我发现铁轨两旁撒了一层黄橙橙的玉米，约有一米半宽。“玉米路”一直通到长春站，没有间断。这可能是从运粮的车上撒下来的，车上的乘客看了无不痛心。
