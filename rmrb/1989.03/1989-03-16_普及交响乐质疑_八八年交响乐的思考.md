The call to "popularize symphony music" has been a persistent theme for many years. The music community has even used this as a goal to organize various activities. The clamor for popularization has even drowned out the concerns over the lack of symphony music creation and the decline in performance standards. In 1988, this trend of popularization only intensified, with actions expanding continuously. It seems that the struggling state of symphony music can only be revived through popularization.

If the main theme of "popularizing symphony music" were to remain within the confines of concert halls, it might be understandable. However, this push for popularization has led to a series of changes in the form, content, and cultural status of symphony performances. Symphony music has stepped out of elegant concert halls and small theaters and into the vast, noisy sports arenas. Complete and grand symphony works have been broken down into fragments and replaced by shallow, arbitrary interpretations. This peak form of musical culture seems to have been reduced to simple, accessible art for the masses in the midst of all the calls for popularization.

When people shout "popularize symphony music," have they considered that once symphony music is popularized, it will become like popular music? The term "popularization" essentially means widespread dissemination, like the current popular songs "The World Outside," "Stars of Last Night," and "Plum Blossom," which are indeed as popular as they can be. If symphony music reaches this point, it would be quite absurd.

Symphony music has a high level of technical difficulty and profound depth, making it a representative art form in the realm of music culture. This nature determines that the passionate audience for symphony music is only a segment of those with cultural and musical refinement. For the majority, it is likely that they will not be able to understand it. Even if they can comprehend a few famous works, their enthusiasm will not surpass that for popular music. In the West, where the cultural level of the masses is high, symphony music has a long tradition. Most people have received basic music education, yet symphony music has still not been popularized. How much more so in a place like ours!

In cultural matters, one cannot hold an egalitarian view. The number of appreciators for various art forms will inevitably be uneven. This is due to the inherent structure of art and its environment. The key is that we should not judge the value of art by the number of its audience. The cultural value of symphony music is recognized worldwide, and the development of symphony music is related to the future of the nation's and ethnicity's musical culture. It is foolish not to put in dedicated effort. However, development does not lie in external noise and excitement, but in how to improve the quality of works and the level of performance. The literary world's poetry is currently quite weak, with few readers, but no one is advocating for "popularizing poetry." The theater world has not promoted "popularizing Kunqu opera," and the dance world has no talk of "popularizing ballet." Why does the music world have to be so unique?

Of course, symphony music should also strive to attract as many audiences as possible to carve out its own space. Apart from its own development, this also requires improving the cultural environment, including developing national music education and popularizing music knowledge. Not only should symphony music knowledge be popularized, but also knowledge of opera, folk music, popular music, and various music cultures. Only by improving the national music quality can the audience for symphony music be increased. As for the issues of low income for symphony artists and lack of financial support for creation and performance, these cannot be solved, as some people imagine, by increasing the audience and box office revenue through popularization. Instead, they should rely on the economic support of the government and society. This is the case in almost all countries around the world.

　　普及交响乐质疑
    ——八八年交响乐的思考
    顾土
    作为一个严肃的课题，“普及交响乐”的口号已持续多年。音乐界甚至以此为目标兴办过种种活动，这阵阵呼唤声甚至淹没了交响乐创作的匮乏和表演水准的下降。一九八八年，这种普及“情绪”有增无减，行动不断扩大，似乎不景气的交响乐，只有普及才能妙手回春。
    假若“普及交响乐”的主旋律仅在音乐厅里奏响，尚能理解，然而，这种普及却导致了交响乐演出形式、内容以及交响乐的文化地位等一连串的变化。交响乐已走出了优雅的音乐厅和小剧场，来到空旷嘈杂的体育馆；宏大完整的交响乐作品，已被化整为零，被浅薄的任意诠释所取代。这一处于颠峰状态的音乐文化，也似乎在一片“普及”的呼喊声中变为简单明了的大众艺术。
    当人们高喊“普及交响乐”的时候，是否想过，交响乐一旦普及，就会变成流行音乐？所谓普及，无非是流传众口，像如今唱得正欢的《外面的世界》、《昨夜星辰》、《一剪梅》等等，那确是普及得不能再普及了。交响乐真走到这一步，未免滑稽。
    交响乐具有高难的技法和深邃的内涵，在音乐文化中属于代表性艺术。这种性质决定了交响乐的热情听众只是一部分有文化修养和音乐素养的人；对于多数人来说，恐怕不大能够理解，即使能够听懂一二首知名的作品，其兴致也不可能大于流行音乐。在民众的文化素质较高的西方，交响乐有悠久传统，多数人都受过音乐的基础教育，交响乐还是未能普及，更何况我们这样的地方呢！
    文化上不能持一种平均的观念。各类艺术的欣赏人数多寡不均是必然的。这是艺术自身的结构和环境所致，关键在于我们不要以观众的数量论英雄定价值。交响乐的文化价值为世所公认，发展交响乐关系到国家、民族的音乐文化的前途，不精心尽力是愚蠢的。但发展不在于外观的喧腾热闹，而在于如何提高作品的质量和演奏水平。文学界的诗歌目前也很疲惫，读者不多，但并未听见有人呼吁“普及诗歌”，戏剧界也没有倡导“普及昆曲”，舞蹈界更无“普及芭蕾”之说。为什么音乐界非要独标一帜呢？
    当然交响乐也要尽可能多地赢得听众，以营造自己的一方天地。这除了自身的发展外，还需要改善文化环境，包括发展国民音乐教育，普及音乐知识。不仅普及交响乐知识，还有歌剧、民乐、流行音乐和各种音乐文化的知识。只有提高国民的音乐素质才能增加交响乐的听众。至于从事交响乐的艺术家收入微薄、创作表演无财力保障等问题，也不能像一些人想象的那样，靠所谓普及后增加听众、提高票房收入来解决，而应依靠政府和社会的经济支持。世界各国几乎都是如此。
