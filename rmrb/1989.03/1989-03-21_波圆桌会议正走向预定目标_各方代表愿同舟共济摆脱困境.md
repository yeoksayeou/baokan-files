The round table conference involving various social forces in Poland has been underway for exactly six weeks. So far, the progress of the conference indicates that, despite intense debates within the conference and continuous strikes and demonstrations outside, the conference is moving toward its predetermined goals due to the unremitting efforts of the participants.

Over the past six weeks, representatives from all sides have, through dialogue, consultation, and mutual concessions, reached agreements on several major issues, achieving consensus or near-consensus.

In terms of the economy, they all expressed concern about Poland's domestic economic situation and supported the Rakowski government's series of measures to deepen economic reforms and rectify the economy. They also expressed their willingness to work together to help the country overcome its difficulties.

In terms of politics, the representatives endorsed the authorities' package plan to expand parliamentary democracy, which includes absorbing constructive opposition parties into the parliament, drafting new election laws, amending the constitution, establishing a presidential system and a senate, and conducting non-confrontational parliamentary elections.

Additionally, representatives from all sides, especially the authorities and Solidarity, reached an agreement after mutual concessions, stipulating that both sides will jointly trustworthy individuals to oversee certain programs related to Polish trade unions on Polish radio and television.

In terms of union pluralism, after obtaining Solidarity's promise that "in the future, it will act in accordance with the constitution, will not become a political party, will not engage in any activities that disrupt social stability, and will not accept foreign aid that violates Polish laws," the authorities agreed to amend the union law to create conditions for Solidarity to re-register. Under the same premise, the authorities also recognized the legal status of the Solidarity Peasant Union and the Independent Students' Union, which were banned at the end of 1981.

However, representatives of the round table conference still have fundamental disagreements on issues such as prices and wages, and the system of appointing leading cadres.

　　波圆桌会议正走向预定目标  各方代表愿同舟共济摆脱困境
    ●经济：赞成深化改革，整顿经济        
    ●政治：赞成扩大议会民主的一揽子方案        
    ●工会多元化：团结工会作出承诺，政府承认其合法地位
    新华社华沙３月１９日电波兰各社会力量代表参加的“圆桌会议”已开了整整６周。迄今为止的会议进程表明，尽管会内观点交锋激烈，会外罢工示威不断，但由于与会者的不懈努力，会议正走向预定的目标。
    ６周来，各方代表通过对话协商和互相妥协在一些重大问题上达成协议，取得了意见一致或接近。
    在经济方面，他们都对波兰国内经济状况“感到担忧”，支持拉科夫斯基政府为深化经济改革、整顿经济而采取的一系列措施，并表示愿意同舟共济，为国家摆脱困境作出贡献。
    在政治方面，代表们赞同当局提出的关于扩大议会民主的一揽子方案，其中包括吸收建设性反对派参加议会、制订新的选举法、修改宪法、设立总统制和参议院以及进行非对抗性的议会选举等。
    此外，各方代表，特别是当局和团结工会代表经过彼此让步达成了协议，规定由双方共同信赖的人来主持波兰电台和电视台有关波兰工会的某些节目。
    在工会多元化方面，在得到团结工会“今后将按照宪法行事，不成为政党，不从事任何破坏社会安定的活动，不接受违背波兰法律的外国资助”的承诺后，当局同意修改工会法，为团结工会重新登记注册创造条件。在同样的前提下，当局还承认１９８１年底被取缔的团结农会和独立大学生联盟的合法地位。
    然而，“圆桌会议”代表们在物价与工资、领导干部任命制度等方面仍存在原则分歧。
