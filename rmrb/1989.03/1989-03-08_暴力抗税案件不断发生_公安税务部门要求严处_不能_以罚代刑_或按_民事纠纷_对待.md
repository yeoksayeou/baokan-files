	Violent tax resistance incidents have been occurring frequently. Public security and tax authorities demand severe punishment. They cannot handle such cases by "punishing instead of sentencing" or treating them as "civil disputes."

	The People's Daily, Beijing, March 7th: Reporter Wang Jinhui reports that Vice Minister of Public Security Yu Lei today told reporters that storming tax offices, surrounding and assaulting tax officials performing their duties are violent acts of tax resistance that trample on socialist legal systems. Such acts are intolerable under national law and must be severely punished. Public security organs must resolutely support and cooperate with tax authorities to ensure that tax officials can perform their duties normally.

	Director of the State Taxation Administration Jin Xin simultaneously introduced that in recent years, some regions have seen frequent incidents of storming tax offices and assaulting tax officials. According to incomplete statistics from 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, from 1985 to the first half of 1988, there were 7,807 such incidents, with over 6,420 tax officials assaulted. Among them, 13 were killed, 27 were disabled, and 786 were seriously injured.

	Yu Lei said that tax officials collecting taxes according to law is a sacred duty bestowed by the state, and their work should be supported and legally protected by the whole society. He pointed out that in some places, the handling of violent tax resistance incidents has been lax, with some cases being dealt with by "punishing instead of sentencing" or treating them as "civil disputes," allowing some lawbreakers to go unpunished and leading to repeated incidents of violent tax resistance. This situation must be corrected.

	Jin Xin said in his remarks that some taxpayers are blinded by greed, disregard the law, and openly resist taxes with violence. A few bad elements incite some of the masses to cause trouble, and this must be severely cracked down upon.

	He said that it is necessary to strengthen legal education and propaganda of tax laws and regulations to enhance citizens' awareness of voluntarily paying taxes according to law. Tax officials should also strictly act according to law when performing their duties, improve their work style, and collect taxes civilly.

　　暴力抗税案件不断发生
    公安税务部门要求严处
    不能“以罚代刑”或按“民事纠纷”对待
    本报北京３月７日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：公安部副部长俞雷今天向记者发表谈话指出，冲击税务机关，围攻、殴打依法执行公务的税务人员等暴力抗税行为，是对社会主义法制的粗暴践踏，为国法所不容，必须严加惩处。公安机关要坚决支持和配合税务机关的工作，保障税务人员正常履行公务。
    国家税务局局长金鑫同时介绍说，近年来，一些地区不断发生冲击税务机关，围攻、殴打税务人员的暴力抗税案件。据３０个省、市、自治区不完全统计，１９８５年至１９８８年上半年，共发生这类案件７８０７起，６４２０余名税务人员被打，其中死亡１３人，致残２７人，重伤７８６人。
    俞雷说，税务人员依法征税，是国家赋予的神圣职责，他们的工作应得到全社会的支持和法律保护。他指出，在一些地方，对暴力抗税案件处理不严、打击不力，有的“以罚代刑”或按“民事纠纷”处理，致使少数不法分子逍遥法外，暴力抗税案件屡禁不止，这种情况必须纠正。
    金鑫在谈话中指出，某些纳税人利欲熏心，目无国法，公然以暴力抗税，有少数坏人裹胁一部分群众闹事，对此，必须严厉打击。
    他说，必须加强法制教育和税收法规的宣传，提高公民自觉依法纳税的意识；税务人员在履行公务时，亦应严格依法办事，改进作风，文明收税。
