Consumers Cannot Be Bought
Wen Niu

In the market, why do substandard, inferior, and even counterfeit products persist despite repeated bans? One important reason is that corrupt practices act as a protective umbrella.

The manufacturers of substandard and inferior products, do they not understand the importance of product quality? If you ask their factory directors to give a report, they might explain it very well. Do they not know that substandard and inferior products harm consumers? They do, and they even understand it better than consumers who are not familiar with the details. However, for the sake of profit, they throw all this aside and use all kinds of improper means to sell substandard and inferior products. They give gifts at procurement meetings, offer kickbacks to purchasing agents from other units, and bribe officials in supervisory departments to obtain "passes"...

Do the purchasing agents and managers in commercial departments not know how to identify substandard and inferior products? Judging by their product knowledge and business experience, most of them do. But they have accepted gifts, taken bribes, and received favors, so they have to buy the products, after all, the benefits are theirs, and the consumers who suffer are the general public.

Some departments that have the power to inspect and approve also have similar "tricks."

To rectify and regulate, of course, measures must be taken to combat these corrupt practices. But to be honest, general education and administrative measures are not very effective because these activities are often hidden under the guise of normal business operations.

The best way is to mobilize consumers, the "Gods" of the market. Consumers have the final say, no matter how you manipulate, I just won't buy. Consumers also have a great advantage: they can form a network to inspect and supervise product quality, making it difficult for even the most cunning substandard and inferior products to escape.

However, the weakness of the general consumers is their lack of knowledge and limited conditions, making it difficult for them to identify product quality, especially for products with new tricks and high technology. Additionally, consumers' psychological weaknesses (which are more pronounced in times of shortage) often make them easily deceived and cheated.

Helping the general consumers improve their discernment is a very meaningful task. Recently, the State Technical Supervision Bureau published a list of substandard products and their manufacturers for the first time, and the Ministry of Light Industry also exposed a batch of substandard products and their manufacturers that caused harm, which are very popular "wise moves"! It can even be imagined that such lists, in addition to being published in newspapers, can be posted as a "blacklist" in the appropriate places in corresponding stores, giving substandard and inferior products negative publicity.

The reason why commodity economy can have a great promoting effect on social production is that it places the broad masses of consumers, who cannot be bought, in the position of "master" of the market, thus making economic activities have the most just and effective judges. In other words, without this, there would be no true commodity economy. We indeed need to think more about this aspect.

　　消费者是收买不了的
    文牛
    市场上，为什么次品、劣品以至假冒商品屡禁不止？一个重要原因，是不正之风充当了保护伞。
    生产次劣产品的那些厂家，不懂得产品质量的重要性吗？如果请他们的厂长作个报告，可能讲得头头是道。他们不懂得次品、劣品要坑害消费者吗？懂得，甚至比那些不了解底细的消费者更懂。但是，为了赚钱，这些都丢掉了，他们千方百计地以不正当的手段推销次劣品。订货会上大送其礼，给外单位采购员以回扣，给主管部门的人以贿赂来取得“通行证”……办法诸多。
    商业部门的采购员、经营者，不能识别次、劣品吗？论他们的商品知识、经营经验，多数情况并非如此。但他们吃了人家的，拿了人家的，得了人家的好处，就要进人家的货，反正好处是自己得，倒霉的是广大消费者。
    一些掌握鉴定、审批权力的部门，也存在着类似的“猫腻”。
    治理、整顿，当然要采取措施反反这些不正之风。但说实在的，一般的教育，一般的行政措施不易奏效，因为这些勾当往往是在正常经营活动的外衣下隐蔽进行的。
    最好的办法，是搬动消费者这位“上帝”。消费者有最后决定权，不管你怎么捣腾，反正我不买。消费者还有一个巨大优势，那就是他们可以组成一个鉴别、监督产品质量的“天罗地网”，再大本事的次、劣品也难以逃遁。
    但是，广大消费者的弱点是知识不足和条件的限制，对产品质量往往一时难以识别，对那些花样翻新、技术较高的产品更是如此，再加上消费者若干心理上的弱点（在供不应求时表现尤为突出），往往容易受骗上当。
    帮助广大消费者提高识别力就成了一件有重要意义的工作。最近，国家技术监督局首次公布了一批劣质产品及生产厂家名单，轻工部也将一批造成恶果的劣质产品及生产厂家拉出示众，是非常得人心的“英明之举”！甚至可以这样设想：这类名单，除在报上公布外，作为一种“黑榜”，在对口的商店的恰当地方张贴，给次、劣品做反面广告。
    商品经济之所以能够对社会生产发生巨大的推动作用，就是因为它把不能收买的广大消费者推上了市场“主宰”的地位，因而使经济活动有了最公正、最有效的裁判者。换句话说，没有这一点，也就没有真正的商品经济。我们确实需要在这方面动更多的脑筋。
