Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 10th.

U.S. scientists have developed a type of adjustable electronic sunglasses.

Scientists from the U.S. Advanced Research Corporation say that these "electrically controlled variable transmission sunglasses" can filter out 44% to 88% of sunlight. In comparison, ordinary glass windows can filter out 20%, and sunglasses can filter out 85% of sunlight.

According to the New York Times, this technology has a wide range of applications, such as in ski goggles, car sunshades, and the manufacture of office and residential glass windows. Glass made with this technology can block out sunlight entering a room on hot summer afternoons, while in winter, it can allow more sunlight to pass through. If equipped with "electronic eyes," the amount of sunlight passing through these glass windows can be adjusted at will.

These sunglasses are made of two layers of glass or plastic, separated by about 1/100 of an inch, with a liquid-filled gap containing tiny needle-shaped particles suspended in it.

The inner surface of the lens is coated with a conductive material that can conduct electricity from a small battery. When the circuit is open, the particles in the liquid float at random angles, blocking out incoming sunlight. When the current is turned on, the induced magnetic field causes the particles to align in rows, allowing more sunlight to pass through. The amount of light transmitted is related to the current supplied.

The current prototypes of these sunglasses are blue. Researchers are developing tea-colored and gray versions and hope to bring these sunglasses to market within two years.

　　美制成可调节电子太阳镜
    新华社华盛顿３月１０日电  美国科学家研究出一种可调节的电子太阳镜。
    美国研究尖端学科有限公司的科学家说，这种“电控光可变传输太阳镜”可以滤除４４％至８８％的阳光，与之相比，普通玻璃窗可滤除２０％，墨镜可滤除阳光的８５％。
    据《纽约时报》报道，这项技术用途很广，如用于滑雪镜、汽车太阳防护板及办公室和住宅玻璃窗的制作等。用这项技术制作的玻璃在炎热夏天的下午可以挡住射入室内的阳光；但在冬天可使更多的阳光通过。如果装备上“电眼”，这种玻璃窗透过的太阳光就可任意调节。
    这种太阳镜用２块玻璃或塑料制成，彼此间隔约１‰英寸，缝隙中充有一种液体，极小的针形微粒悬浮在液体中。
    透镜的内表面覆有一层导电材料，它能传导来自微小电池的电流。当电路断开时，液体中的粒子以任意的角度悬浮着，挡住射入的阳光，当接通电流后，诱发的磁场使粒子排列成行，允许较多的阳光进入，透入的光量与通入的电流有关。
    目前制成的太阳镜是蓝色的，研究人员正在研制茶色和灰色的，他们希望这种太阳镜在２年内面市。
