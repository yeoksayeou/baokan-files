More and more Qingdao residents are expressing satisfaction with the variety and prices of vegetables at state-run stalls. Since last year, state-run stalls have accounted for 66 percent of the total vegetable supply in Qingdao City. Because the state-run vegetable stores have played a role in stabilizing market prices, the overall vegetable prices in Qingdao have remained relatively stable. Among the 32 major cities in the country, Qingdao ranks 25th in terms of price levels.
