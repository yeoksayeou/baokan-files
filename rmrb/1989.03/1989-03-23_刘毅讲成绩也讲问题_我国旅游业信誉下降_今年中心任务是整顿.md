Liu Yi, the head of the National Tourism Administration, broke away from the traditional "reporting good news but not bad news" model in his speech at the national tourism bureau chiefs' meeting that began today. While acknowledging the achievements of 1988, he also issued a warning about the declining reputation of China's tourism industry.

In 1988, China's tourism industry continued to develop. The number of organized overseas tourists reached 4,349,000, generating $2.22 billion in tourism revenue. The number of domestic tourists exceeded 300 million, with 1.87 billion yuan in currency circulation, representing year-on-year increases of 14.9%, 19.2%, 3.5%, and 33%, respectively. Two points are particularly noteworthy: first, China's early tourism investments have begun to yield significant results, with the number of cities receiving over 100,000 overseas tourists increasing from 13 in 1985 to 18 currently; second, the foreign exchange growth rate once again surpassed the growth rate of tourist numbers, setting a record high for the past decade.

However, problems are also quite prominent, manifesting as follows:

	•	Industry management is lax, service quality is poor, overseas tourists' meal expenses are arbitrarily deducted, and some guides and drivers use unscrupulous methods to demand tips and kickbacks, leading to an increasing number of tourist complaints that are becoming more pointed;
	•	Transportation capacity is insufficient, flights are frequently delayed, train tickets are hard to buy, travel schedules are not guaranteed, and traffic accidents are on the rise;
	•	Marketing in the global tourism market is unfavorable, competitiveness is weak, market share is declining, and the two major traditional tourist markets of Japan and the United States are slipping.

Liu Yi pointed out that China's tourism reputation is continually declining, seriously affecting short-term tourist growth and the long-term development of the entire industry. He hopes that all relevant parties will have a clear understanding of China's tourism service quality and have self-awareness.

In light of this, the central task of China's tourism industry in 1989 is to rectify the tourism economic order, improve service quality and reception standards, and establish a reputation in the international tourism market for quality and value for money in Chinese tourism.

　　刘毅讲成绩也讲问题        
    我国旅游业信誉下降        
    今年中心任务是整顿
    本报北京３月２２日讯  记者刘霄报道：国家旅游局局长刘毅在今天开始的全国旅游局长会议上的讲话突破了“报喜不报忧”的传统模式，在肯定１９８８年成绩的同时，对我国旅游信誉下降的问题提出了警告。
    １９８８年，我国旅游业持续发展。有组织接待的海外旅游者达到４３４．９万人，旅游创汇２２．２亿美元，国内旅游人数超过３亿，回笼货币１８７亿元，分别比上年增长１４．９％、１９．２％、３．５％和３３％。其中，有两点特别值得称道：一是我国旅游前期投入开始产生明显效益，接待１０万以上海外旅游者的城市由１９８５年的１３个增加到目前的１８个；二是外汇增长率再次超过接待人数增长率，创１０年来的最高增长纪录。
    但是，问题也相当突出，表现为：
    行业管理不严，服务质量差，随意克扣国外游客的餐食费用，部分导游、司机不择手段索要小费和回扣，游客投诉越来越多，越来越尖锐；
    交通运力不足，飞机经常晚点，火车票难买，旅行日程没有保证，交通事故上升；
    在世界旅游市场营销不利，竞争力弱，市场份额下降，日本、美国两大传统客源市场滑坡。
    刘毅指出，我国旅游信誉不断下降，已经严重影响近期的客源增长和整个行业的远期发展，他希望各有关方面对我国旅游服务质量要有清醒的认识，要有自知之明。
    鉴于此，１９８９年全国旅游业的中心任务就是整顿旅游经济秩序，提高服务质量和接待水平，在国际旅游市场上树立起质价相符的中国旅游形象。
