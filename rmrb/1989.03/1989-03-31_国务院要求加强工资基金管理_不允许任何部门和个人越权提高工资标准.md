The State Council requires strengthening management of wage funds
	No department or individual may exceed authority to raise wage standards

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 30th - In order to reduce aggregate demand and control the rapid growth of consumption funds, the State Council today issued a notice requiring further strengthening of the management of wage funds.

	The State Council's notice states that the total wage budget allocated by the state must be strictly implemented by all regions and departments, and allocated to grassroots units according to their subordination. Grassroots units should formulate wage fund usage plans based on the annual total wage budget approved by the state, and after being reviewed by the competent department and approved by the labor department at the same level in conjunction with relevant departments, they should be included in the "Wage Fund Management Handbook." The bank where the account is opened will supervise the payment of wages according to this. Any amount exceeding the planned amount will be refused by the bank. Enterprises, institutions, government agencies, and other units can only set up one wage fund special account in the bank where they conduct cash settlement within the unit.

	The State Council's notice emphasizes that wage issues that affect the overall situation should be considered and arranged by the central government and the State Council. No region, department, or individual has the right to independently raise the wage grade or the wage standard for government agencies and institutions, or to increase the basic wage (including allowances and subsidies) included in the enterprise's cost and expenses; no right to independently decide to reduce or exempt wage adjustment tax and bonus tax; no right to use other funds or adopt other methods to increase workers' wages. For violations of relevant state regulations, in addition to ordering immediate correction, economic penalties will also be imposed, and the administrative responsibilities of relevant leaders and direct responsible persons will be investigated. In serious cases, legal action will be taken.

　　国务院要求加强工资基金管理        
    不允许任何部门和个人越权提高工资标准
    新华社北京３月３０日电  为了压缩社会总需求，控制消费基金过快增长，国务院今天发布通知，要求进一步加强工资基金管理。
    国务院通知说，国家下达的工资总额计划，各地区、各部门必须认真执行，并按隶属关系落实到基层单位。各基层单位要根据国家核定的年度工资总额，编制工资基金使用计划，经主管部门审核并经同级劳动部门会同有关部门批准后列入《工资基金管理手册》。开户银行据此监督支付工资。超过计划规定数额的，银行一律拒付。各企业、事业、机关、团体等单位，只能在本单位进行现金结算的开户银行设立一个工资基金专户。
    国务院通知强调，事关全局的工资问题，由中央、国务院通盘考虑，统一部署。任何地区、部门和个人，无权自行提高工资区类别和机关、事业单位工资标准，以及增加在企业成本、费用中列支基本工资（包括津贴、补贴等）；无权自行决定减征或免征工资调节税、奖金税；无权动用其他资金或采取其他办法增加职工工资。对违反国家有关规定的，除应责令其立即纠正外，还要给予经济处罚，并追究有关领导和直接责任者的行政责任，情节严重的，要依法惩处。
