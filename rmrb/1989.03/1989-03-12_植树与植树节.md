Forests are the cradle of life. Our ancestors lived in the forests, using trees to protect against the cold, wearing leaves as clothing, eating wild fruits to fill their stomachs, building nests with wood, creating fire by rubbing sticks, and hunting with wooden clubs. They relied on forests to develop human civilization. People have always held deep affection for trees. The "Mountains and Seas Classic" tells the story of Kuafu chasing the sun, where Kuafu, on the verge of death, throws down his staff, which turns into a forest, benefiting mankind. This reflects our ancestors' beautiful wish to plant trees and create forests. As early as over 3,000 years ago during the Shang Dynasty, oracle bone inscriptions already recorded the scene of planting flowers and trees in front of and behind houses. During the Western Zhou period, China had officials like "Shanyu" and "Linheng" specifically in charge of forestry. Starting from the Qin Dynasty, regulations were made to plant trees along city streets and major roads for greening. "The Qin Dynasty built expressways across the country, with the roads being fifty paces wide and lined with green pines." By the Tang Dynasty, it was ordered that all post stations be planted with roadside trees. During the Yuan Dynasty, the "Agricultural and Sericultural Regulations" were issued, clearly stipulating: "Each adult should plant twenty saplings of mulberry and jujube annually, and if the soil is not suitable, plant willows and elms." In 1915, China designated the Qingming Festival as Arbor Day. In 1929, to commemorate Sun Yat-sen, who consistently advocated for afforestation, Arbor Day was changed to his death anniversary—March 12. In 1979, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decided to continue using March 12 as China's Arbor Day.

　　植树与植树节
    森林，是生命的摇篮，人类的祖先栖居森林之中，以林木抵御风寒，树叶为衣，野果饱腹，积木为巢，钻木取火，木棍猎兽，依靠森林发展了人类文明，人类对树木总是怀着深厚感情。《山海经》里有“夸父逐日”的故事，说夸父临死前扔掉手中柱杖，化为森林，造福于人类。反映了我们的祖先植树造林的美好愿望。早在３０００多年前的殷商时期，甲骨文上就已记载了房前屋后栽种花木的情景。西周时期，我国设有“山虞”和“林衡”等专管林木的官职。秦代开始，规定在城街街巷和大道两旁种树绿化。“秦为驰道于天下，道广五十步，植以青松”。到唐代，明令驿站之间全部种上道树。元代曾颁布《农桑之制》，明文规定：“每丁岁种桑枣二十株，土性不宜者，种榆柳。”到了１９１５年我国规定清明节为植树节。１９２９年，为纪念一贯倡导植树造林的孙中山，将植树节改在他逝世那天——３月１２日。１９７９年全国人大常委会决定，仍以３月１２日为我国植树节。
