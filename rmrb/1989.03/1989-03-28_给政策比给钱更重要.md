Currently, the lagging development of railway construction is directly affecting the overall efficiency of the national economy. We should start from the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, prioritize railway construction as a key industry, and make the entire 1990s a period of railway revitalization. We should not leave the problem of transportation as a "cripple" to be solved in the 21st century.

The urgent task at hand is to solve the problem of railway investment and ensure the benign cycle of railway construction and transportation production. There are multiple ways to increase investment: one is to increase direct investment from the state, and the other is to "provide policies" for self-accumulation. Currently, the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period is a peak time for repaying debts, and the fiscal situation is very difficult. It is necessary to appropriately increase direct investment, but it cannot be too much. A more realistic approach is for the state to provide some "policies" to the railways, increase self-accumulation, increase self-investment, strengthen self-reform, and expand reproduction. Some comrades say that "providing policies" is also giving money, which is true, but the nature and effects are different. One is obtained by asking for it, and the other is achieved through hard work. The impact on society, the department, and the enterprise is vastly different. In recent years, the state has implemented a contract responsibility system for the railways, adopting a policy of self-revenue and self-support, which has played a good role in increasing railway investment and strengthening reform and development. However, the policy scope is still not wide enough and can be further relaxed. For example, can we further increase the depreciation rate, appropriately adjust the tax rate, exempt some fund taxes and fees, allow more price adjustment income to remain with the railways, and allow the railway department to conduct internal financing, etc.

In addition, the raising of railway construction funds should take the route of "multiple channels" and "multiple methods." It should combine central and local efforts, state and enterprise efforts, domestic and foreign capital, and national and overseas Chinese capital. The "raising funds for construction, operating for repayment" method should be implemented.

　　给政策比给钱更重要
    陆百甫（国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心研究员）目前，铁路建设的滞后，直接影响了国民经济整体效益的发挥，我们应当从“八五”时期开始，把铁路建设做为重点发展产业来抓，把整个九十年代列为铁路振兴时期，不要把运输“瘸子”留待二十一世纪去解决。
    当务之急是要努力解决铁路投入的问题，保证铁路建设与运输生产的良性循环。增加投入有多种路子，一是增加国家的直接投资，一是“给政策”自我积累。现在看来，“八五”时期是还债高峰，财政十分困难，适当增加直接投入是必要的，但不可能很多。比较现实的是国家给铁路一些“政策”，增加自我积累、增加自我投入、加强自我改造和扩大再生产。有同志说“给政策”也是给钱，是的，但性质、作用不同。一是伸手要来的，一是努力干出来的，对社会、对部门、对企业作用和影响大不一样。前些年，国家对铁路实行包干，采取自收自支、以收抵支政策，对增加铁路投入，强化改造与发展起了很好作用。但政策宽度还不够，可以再适当放宽。如是否可以进一步提高折旧率、适当调整税率、免征一些基金税费、调价收入更多地留给铁路、允许铁路部门内部进行融资等政策措施。
    此外，铁路建设资金的筹集应当走“多渠道”、“多方式”的路子。要中央与地方结合、国家与企业结合、内资与外资结合、国资与侨资结合。实行“筹资建设，运营还款”办法。
