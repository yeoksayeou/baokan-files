Another heart-stirring nine-episode TV series, *Teacher's Soul*, has begun airing.

Li Baotian, renowned for his portrayal of Ge the Shopkeeper, plays the role of a vocational high school teacher, Fan Shaobo, who is constantly caught in the midst of intense spiritual conflicts: a soul disillusioned and confused by reality, restless and anxious, intertwines and clashes with a soul that loves, strives for, and navigates life with ease. This forms a rich and evolving inner world. The vortex of despair and confusion created by the one-sided pursuit of admission rates threatens schools, families, and society. The tender hearts of children are also branded with indelible scars. Fan Shaobo and the other teachers at the vocational school, with their deep love for the students, strive to "teach students a skill so that they have a path to success in any field." In their selfless dedication, they almost sacrifice their own "self-respect" and "professionalism." The TV series *Teacher's Soul* vividly and dynamically depicts the pain of the birth of new things, and the journey of Fan Shaobo's soul, where the flame of his spirit is extinguished, reignited, extinguished again, and reignited once more.

The entire series is infused with a touch of humor, adding a magical charm to the trembling souls. The humor in Li Baotian's performance is a natural extension of his innate temperament. His quick and witty responses, his circuitous and witty remarks, are full of spontaneity and unpredictability. His genuine emotions well up from the depths of his soul, providing an aesthetic pleasure of witty remarks and a refreshing breeze that dispels worries. However, after the laughter, one suddenly feels that there is something hidden within the smile.

The creators of this drama (Zhū Gě Yí and Yáng Tāng) place the souls they have explored within the great tide of social change, paying particular attention to the immense impact of contemporary environment and consciousness on the souls of the characters. The hearts of vocational high school students like Wang Xiaoyue, Bo Jun, and Tang Jing reflect the complex psychological changes of society.

Of course, the most heart-rending scene is the "Drunken Farewell." It fully utilizes the power of the television camera to create an atmosphere of vastness, mystery, excitement, and yet loss and sadness, making the protagonist's emotional tension always maintained in the rhythm of self-dialogue and self-perception of "I do not want, do not want to be a teacher" while still desperately seeking the "teacher's soul." Joy is tinged with a hint of bitterness, sweetness is mixed with a touch of astringency. This is a truly real, deep, and yet mysterious soul tremor. It is this subtle change in the soul's tremor that makes people's aesthetic emotions break away from the inertia track, gaining fresh and unique feelings. Although the process of the characters' soul transformation in the drama is somewhat shallow and stiff, lacking elasticity and tension, the overall grasp and analysis of the series *Teacher's Soul* is similar to *Green Shade*, and is undoubtedly an excellent work that showcases the turmoil of souls, rich in imagery and profound in meaning, leaving a lasting impression after viewing.

    灵魂在嬗变中颤动
    ——看电视连续剧《师魂》
    徐宏
    又一部动人心魄的九集连续剧《师魂》开播了。
    由扮演葛掌柜而蜚声屏坛的李保田饰演的职业高中老师范少波，始终被置于激烈的灵魂冲突之中：一个对现实厌卷困惑、烦躁不安的灵魂与对生活热爱、奋进、潇洒自如的灵魂，相互交织，相互撞击，构成了一个发展中的丰富的内心世界。那片面追求升学率所形成的失望、迷茫的可怕旋涡，威胁着学校、家庭和社会。孩子稚嫩的心灵也被烙下难以磨灭的伤记。范少波与中学的老师们怀着对孩子深深的爱，为了“要教会学生有一技之长，在任何行业里都有成材之路”。他们在“清汤寡水的无私奉献”中，几乎连自己的“自尊心”和“事业心”都被“奉献”出去了。电视剧《师魂》形象而生动地展现了新生事物诞生的痛苦，范少波灵魂的沉浮中灵魂之火的熄灭、点燃、又熄灭、又点燃的心路历程。
    全剧飘逸着几分幽默，为颤动的灵魂平添了灵妙的魔力。李保田表演艺术中的幽默成分，是由他内在的天赋气质流贯而成的。他那迅捷而机智的反应，迂回而风趣的谈吐，充满了随机性和突发性，至真之情，从灵魂深处溢出，给人以妙语解颐、春风释烦的审美乐趣。然而在笑过之后，又突然感觉这笑中隐含着什么。
    这个剧的编、导者（诸葛怡、杨韬）把自己所开掘的灵魂，都放置社会变革的大潮之中，十分注意当代环境、意识对人物灵魂的巨大作用力。工读生王小月和薄军、汤静等一批职业高中生的心灵，大都呈现出复杂社会心理变革的投影。
    当然，最撼荡心灵的是“醉酒告别”这场戏。它充分调动了电视艺术的镜头力量，造成一种空旷、玄妙、兴奋而又失落、悲凉的氛围，致使主人公情绪的张力，始终保持在“我不愿、不愿当老师”而又在苦苦追寻“老师灵魂”的自我独白、自我感受的韵律里。快慰中透出一丝辛酸，甜美中挟裹一缕苦涩。这是一次最真实、最深层同时又是最玄妙的灵魂颤动。正是这种灵魂颤动中的微妙变化，使人们的审美感情脱离惯性跑道，获得新鲜、独特的感受。虽然，剧中人物的灵魂嬗变过程，有的还显得浅露、呆滞，缺乏弹性与张力。但从全剧总体把握剖析，连续剧《师魂》与《绿荫》具有异曲同工之妙，不失为一部展现灵魂激荡，形象丰富、内涵深邃的优秀之作，看后令人回味不已。
