	Reagan Agrees to Join the Board of Directors of the National Review
	Our reporter Zhang Qixun reports from Washington, February 28: According to the Washington Post, former U.S. President Reagan recently expressed his agreement to join the board of directors of the National Review magazine, becoming one of its new directors.

	Reagan's spokesperson said yesterday that this is the only board of directors Reagan has joined since leaving office.

	The National Review was founded by William F. Buckley Jr. and has a history of 34 years. It currently has a circulation of 115,000 copies and is considered a biweekly publication of the American conservative movement. Buckley and Reagan are longtime friends. Buckley said Reagan will occasionally meet with the magazine's board members and editors and may also write something specifically for the magazine, but Reagan will not receive any payment from the magazine and will not assist with the magazine's financial difficulties.

　　里根同意当《国民评论》董事
    本报华盛顿２月２８日电  记者张启昕报道：据《华盛顿邮报》报道，美国前总统里根最近表示，他同意参加《国民评论》杂志的董事会，成为它的一名新董事。
    里根的发言人昨天说，里根离任后参加的董事会仅此一家。
    《国民评论》是威廉·布克莱创刊的，有３４年历史，目前发行量为１１５０００份，被认为是美国保守主义运动的半月刊。布克莱与里根是多年朋友，他说里根将不时同杂志的董事和编辑见面，可能也为杂志专门写点东西，但里根将不收取杂志的报酬，也不资助杂志的债务困难。
