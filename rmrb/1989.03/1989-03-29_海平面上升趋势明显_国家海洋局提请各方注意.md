	Sea Level Rising Trend is Clear
	State Oceanic Administration Urges Attention

	BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the State Oceanic Administration said today that long-term continuous observations from dozens of marine observation stations and tide gauges have shown that the water temperature and sea level in most of China's coastal waters are rising noticeably. Relevant departments should take timely measures to ensure that coastal agricultural and industrial production and people's lives are not affected by disasters.

	Over the past century, especially since the 1960s, global sea water temperatures have gradually increased due to the impact of "global warming." The global sea level has risen an average of 14.4 centimeters over the past century. The sea level in China's coastal waters has risen an average of 11.5 centimeters, with an annual rate of change of 0.115 centimeters. It is predicted that by the year 2000, the sea level in most of China's coastal waters will continue to rise. The rise will be most significant in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan, exceeding 4.80 centimeters; in the southern part of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, the rise will be slightly smaller, ranging from 2.0 to 4.64 centimeters; in the Bohai Sea, the Shandong Peninsula, and the northern part of Jiangsu, the sea level will remain relatively stable, with slight rises or falls in some areas.

	The spokesman emphasized that China's coastal regions are densely populated, with many large and medium-sized cities and industrial facilities. The potential consequences of sea level rise should be fully understood. He hopes that in the future, the selection of sites and the starting heights for new coastal projects will fully consider this factor. The exploitation of urban groundwater must be strictly controlled to prevent excessive and unregulated extraction, which could cause land subsidence and exacerbate the rise in sea level.

　　海平面上升趋势明显        
    国家海洋局提请各方注意
    本报北京３月２８日讯  记者王溪元报道：国家海洋局新闻发言人今天说，数十个海洋观测站和验潮站长期连续观测获得的资料数据表明，我国大部分沿岸海域的海水温度和海平面呈明显的上升趋势，各有关方面应适时采取对策，以保证沿海的工农业生产和人民生活免受灾害。
    近百年特别是６０年代以来，由于受“地球暖化”的影响，全球海水温度逐渐增高。全球海平面在过去百年中平均上升了１４．４厘米，我国沿岸海域的海平面则平均上升１１．５厘米，其年变速率为０．１１５厘米。预测到２０００年，我国大部分沿岸海域的海平面将继续呈上升趋势，其中广东、广西、海南海平面上升幅度最大，高于４．８０厘米；江苏南部、浙江、福建沿岸海平面上升稍小，约在２．０至４．６４厘米之间；渤海沿岸、山东半岛、江苏北部沿岸的海平面大体平稳，局部岸段略有下降或上升。
    这位发言人强调说，我国沿海地区人口稠密，大中城市和工业设施比较集中，对海平面上升可能引起的后果应有足够的认识。他希望今后沿海的新建工程在选址和设计起始高度时，要充分考虑这一因素。对城市地下水的开采，必须严格控制，切忌因盲目过量开采，造成地面沉降，加剧海平面上升。
