Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 12th.

	Ryzhkov pointed out that the process of Soviet economic reform is complex and contradictory, with progress made every day but also many pressing problems that need to be solved. It is not easy to establish a more progressive organizational management structure in the short term without disrupting important economic processes.

	Ryzhkov met with voters in Kemerovo on the 11th and outlined the situation of Soviet economic reform, policies to strengthen local autonomy, measures to improve the financial situation, and agricultural policies.

	When discussing measures to achieve financial balance, Ryzhkov emphasized the need to reduce capital construction investment, ensuring that the scale of construction is in line with financial and material capabilities. He also mentioned reducing military expenditures, decreasing the number of loss-making enterprises, and lowering management costs to cut down on state budget expenditures. He stated that the output value of consumer goods and services should increase by more than 10% each year in the next two years.

	When discussing agricultural reform, Ryzhkov said that on the basis of various forms of operation such as collective farms, state farms, cooperatives, leased collectives, individual households, and personal sideline production, efforts should be made to rapidly and vigorously develop agricultural-industrial complexes. The basic links of agricultural production should be fully independent, and the management functions of agricultural-industrial complexes should be handed over to the union republics, enhancing their role and responsibility in meeting the food consumption needs of residents.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 11th.

	Zaykov, a member of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Committee and First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee, met with representatives of Moscow's party and social organizations on the 10th. He stressed that what is needed today is not discussion about multi-party systems but to unite society to achieve the primary goal of reform.

	When discussing the multi-party system that is widely debated in the Soviet Union today, he pointed out that a multi-party system does not guarantee social democracy. There are many countries in the world with several parties, but democracy there serves a certain class.

	Regarding the radical slogans put forward by some people in the current election campaign, Zaykov explicitly stated that the so-called "vanguard" is not beneficial to the common cause of the Soviet Union. They play with terms and seek to gain cheap fame by exploiting the situation.

　　雷日科夫指出
    苏联经济改革进程复杂而矛盾
    扎伊科夫说多党制并不能保证社会民主
    新华社莫斯科３月１２日电  苏联部长会议主席雷日科夫指出，苏联经济改革进程复杂而矛盾，每天有进展，也有亟待解决的麻烦问题。要在短期内建立较进步的组织管理结构，同时又不破坏重要经济进程，是不容易的。
    雷日科夫１１日在克麦罗沃会见选民时，概述了苏联经济改革形势、加强地方自主权的政策、改善苏联财政收支状况的措施和农业政策。
    在谈到实现财政收支平衡的措施时，雷日科夫强调要削减基建投资，使基建规模符合财力和物力，要通过削减军费、减少亏损企业和降低管理费用来压缩国家预算开支；今明两年的消费品和服务业产值每年要增长１０％以上。
    雷日科夫在谈到农业领域的改革时说，要在集体农庄、国营农场、合作社、租赁集体、个体农户和个人副业等多种经营方式的基础上，尽快大力发展农工综合体生产，让农业生产的基本环节完全独立自主，把农工综合体生产的管理职能交给加盟共和国，提高其在满足居民食品消费方面的作用和责任。
    新华社莫斯科３月１１日电　苏共中央政治局委员、中央书记兼莫斯科市委第一书记扎伊科夫１０日在会见莫斯科党和社会团体代表时强调，今天需要的不是关于多党制的议论，而是把社会团结起来实现改革的首要目标。
    他在谈到当前苏联广泛议论的多党制时指出，多党制并不能保证社会的民主，世界上有不少国家存在好几个党，但那儿的民主是为某一阶级服务的。
    针对某些人在当前选举运动中提出的激进口号，扎伊科夫明确表示，所谓的“先锋派”无益于苏联的共同事业，他们玩弄术语，力求利用形势获取廉价的声望。
