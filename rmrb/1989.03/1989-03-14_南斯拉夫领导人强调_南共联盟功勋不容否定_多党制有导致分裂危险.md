Yugoslav leaders have emphasized that the merits of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) cannot be denied, and that the multi-party system poses the risk of splitting the country.

	BELGRADE, March 12 (Xinhua) — The chairman of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Jovic, today stressed that the LCY has been and remains the only political force that can unite the peoples of Yugoslavia.

	Jovic made these remarks in an interview with the reporter of the newspaper "Pobjeda." He said: "We can be dissatisfied with certain officials, even leaders, but the basic principles of the Communist League and its historical merits for our country cannot be denied."

	When discussing the recent establishment of some political organizations in the Republic of Slovenia, Jovic said that some newly formed parties have clearly stated their programs, which negate autonomy, socialism, communist ideology, the policy of non-alignment, and the federal system of the state. The main goal of some new parties is to seize power and exclude the League of Communists from political life.

	He said that Yugoslavia has historical experience with the implementation of a multi-party system. He emphasized that Yugoslavia is a multi-ethnic family, and the implementation of a multi-party system poses the danger of splitting this multi-ethnic family. He believes that political pluralism can be realized within the framework of the united front of the Socialist Alliance.

　　南斯拉夫领导人强调
    南共联盟功勋不容否定  多党制有导致分裂危险
    新华社贝尔格莱德３月１２日电  南斯拉夫劳动人民社会主义联盟主席乔拉科维奇今天强调指出，南共联盟过去和现在都是唯一能把南斯拉夫各族人民联合起来的政治力量。
    乔拉科维奇是在接受《胜利报》记者采访时说这番话的。他说：“我们可以对某些负责人、甚至领导人表示不满，但是，共产主义者联盟的基本宗旨及其对我国的历史性功勋是不能否定的。”
    在谈到斯洛文尼亚共和国最近成立的一些政治组织时，乔拉科维奇说，有些新成立的政党明确地宣布了纲领，而这些纲领否定自治、社会主义、共产主义的意识形态、不结盟政策和国家的联邦制度，有些新党的主要目的是夺取政权并把共盟排挤出政治生活。
    他说，南斯拉夫在历史上有过实行多党制的教训。他强调，南斯拉夫是个多民族的大家庭，实行多党制有使这个多民族大家庭分裂的危险。他认为，政治利益多元化可以在社会主义联盟这个统一战线的范围内实现。
