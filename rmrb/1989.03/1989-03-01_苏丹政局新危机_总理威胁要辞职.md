Sudan faces a new political crisis as Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi threatens to resign.

	Newspaper: Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, February 27th

	Sudan's Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi today warned in a speech to the parliament that unless the armed forces allow him to form a new government and work for peace in southern Sudan, he will resign next Sunday.

	He urged the military not to take military action and the unions not to go on strike.

	A week ago, about 300 Sudanese officers signed an ultimatum demanding that the government form a national unity government within a week and quickly end the six-year-long civil war. Al-Mahdi issued the above threat as the week expired. Last Saturday, al-Mahdi's Muslim-led government decided to accept the military's ultimatum and agreed to form a broad-based cabinet. However, the military did not respond. The armed forces headquarters, chaired by General Ahmed Ali, began a meeting from early this morning to discuss the national situation after al-Mahdi's government yielded to the military's demands.

	According to another report, four unidentified gunmen today opened fire on the residence of Sudanese President Mirghani. The guards retaliated. After the incident, the police quickly blocked the roads and conducted a search and arrest operation, detaining three of the gunmen. The case is under investigation.

	Mirghani is the leader of the Sudanese Unionist Democratic Party. The party had formed a coalition government with al-Mahdi's Umma Party. Due to disagreements over the peace agreement in the south, the Unionist Democratic Party withdrew from the coalition government last December.

### 苏丹政局新危机  总理威胁要辞职

　　苏丹政局新危机
    总理威胁要辞职
    新华社喀土穆２月２７日电  苏丹总理萨迪克·迈赫迪今天在议会发表讲话中威胁说，除非武装部队让他放手组织新政府并为苏丹南方的和平而努力，否则他将于下星期日辞职。
    他要求军队不要采取军事行动，工会不要举行罢工。
    一周前，约３００名苏丹军官签名的一份最后通牒要求政府在一周内组成一个民族团结政府和尽快结束长达６年的内战。迈赫迪就是在一周期满时发出上述威胁的。上星期六，迈赫迪领导的穆斯林政府决定接受军方提出的最后通牒，同意组成基础广泛的内阁。但军方对此没有作出反应。武装部队统帅部在总司令艾哈迈德·阿里将军的主持下从今天凌晨起召开会议，讨论迈赫迪总理屈从于军方的要求之后全国的局势。
    另据报道，４名身份不明的枪手今天开枪袭击了苏丹总统米尔加尼的住所，警卫进行了还击。事件发生后，警方迅速进行了封锁道路和搜捕活动，并逮捕了３名枪手。此案正在调查中。
    米尔加尼是苏丹联合民主党领导人。该党曾同迈赫迪为首的乌玛党组成联合政府。因在南方和平协议问题上发生分歧，联合民主党于去年１２月退出了联合政府。
