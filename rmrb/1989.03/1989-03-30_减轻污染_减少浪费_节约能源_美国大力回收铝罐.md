Xinhua News Agency, New York, March 28th.

The U.S. Can Manufacturers Institute estimated on March 28 that last year, the United States recycled a record 42.5 billion aluminum beverage and beer cans, with a recycling rate increasing from 50.5 percent in 1987 to 54.6 percent.

The value of the recycled aluminum cans last year is estimated to be $700 million. Since 1981, aluminum can recyclers have earned nearly $3 billion.

Michael Dunn, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, stated in a written statement that their goal is to achieve a recycling rate of at least 75 percent for aluminum cans by 1995. If this target is met, by the mid-1990s, the United States could recycle approximately 90 billion aluminum cans annually, yielding about 25 billion pounds of aluminum.

Recycling aluminum cans has at least two benefits: first, it reduces environmental pollution; second, it minimizes waste and conserves a significant amount of energy. It is calculated that the energy required to produce a new beverage can from recycled aluminum is only about 5 percent of the energy needed from mining to can production. Dunn said, "The energy saved by recycling aluminum cans in 1988 alone would be enough to meet the annual energy needs of a large city like Boston."

### 减轻污染　减少浪费　节约能源  美国大力回收铝罐

    美国大力回收铝罐
    新华社纽约三月二十八日电  据美国罐头制造商协会二十八日估计，去年美国回收的铝质软饮料和啤酒罐达到创纪录的四百二十五亿只，回收率从一九八七年的百分之五十点五提高到百分之五十四点六。
    去年回收的废铝罐价值估计达到七亿美元。自一九八一年以来，铝罐回收商已获利近三十亿美元。
    罐头制造商协会会长迈克尔·邓恩在一份书面声明中说，他们的目标是，到一九九五年铝罐的回收率至少达到百分之七十五。如果这一目标得以实现，到九十年代中期，美国每年回收的铝罐可能达到九百亿只左右，可以提炼出约二十五亿磅铝。
    回收废铝罐至少有两点好处：第一，减轻环境污染；第二，减少浪费和节约大量的能源。据测算，用回收的铝罐制做一只新的饮料罐所需的能源只相当于从炼铝到制罐所需能源的百分之五。邓恩说，“仅一九八八年回收铝罐所节省的能源就足以供波士顿这样一座大城市全年的能源所需。”
