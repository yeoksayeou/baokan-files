Edition: 6

The Encyclopedia of China: Architecture, Gardens, and Urban Planning has recently been published. According to the order of publication, it is the 32nd volume of the Encyclopedia of China. The volume contains 781 entries and 1,047 illustrations, comprehensively and systematically introducing the basic knowledge and achievements in the fields of architecture, gardens, and urban planning since the dawn of human history. It is the first comprehensive, content-rich, easily searchable, and well-illustrated reference book in the field of architecture in our country.

Architecture, gardens, and urban planning are three closely related disciplines. They share a common object of exploration—the problem of human living environments; they have many similarities in thinking methods, artistic treatment, and technical applications. Traditional architectural studies include the design of buildings, building complexes, and interiors, as well as the planning and design of gardens and urban and rural settlements. In modern times, with the development of human architectural culture, the fields of gardens and urban planning gradually separated from architecture and became relatively independent disciplines. However, the three fields still intersect and penetrate each other in many ways. Many scholars believe that the broad sense of architecture includes these three disciplines, so they adopted a compilation method that integrates the three disciplines into one volume.

The volume is divided into 8 sections. The architecture section includes Chinese architectural history, foreign architectural history, architectural design, architectural construction, architectural physics, and architectural equipment, totaling 6 sections. The garden section and the urban planning section each form one section.

In terms of entry settings, all three disciplines have overview entries, case entries, type entries, and theoretical concept entries. Overview entries are multi-layered, allowing readers to check the book at different levels and obtain information. All three disciplines list a large number of case entries and provide basic introductions and technical and artistic analyses for each case. Theoretical concept entries include "Romantic Architecture," "Broadacre City," "Theory of Organic Dispersion," "Doupou," and "Material Ratio," which have the function of clarifying doubts.

At the beginning of the volume, there are three overview articles: "Architecture" by Dai Nianci and Qi Kang, "Garden Science" by Wang Juyuan, and "Urban Planning" by Wu Liangyong.

　　中国大百科全书《建筑·园林·城市规划》卷
    中国大百科全书《建筑·园林·城市规划》卷最近问世。按照出版先后，它是《中国大百科全书》的第３２卷。全卷共收条目７８１个，插图１０４７幅，全面系统地介绍了建筑、园林、城市规划三个领域的基础知识和人类有史以来在这些领域中取得的成就。它是我国建筑学方面第一部包罗广泛、内容丰盈、检索方便、文图并茂的大型工具书。
    建筑、园林、城市规划是三个密切相关的学科。它们有共同探索的对象——人类居住环境问题；它们在思维方式、艺术处理、技术运用上有许多近似之处。传统建筑学的研究对象既包括建筑、建筑群以及室内的设计，也包括园林和城市村镇的规划设计。到了近代，随着人类建筑文化的发展，园林和城市规划两个领域逐渐从建筑学中分化出来，成为相对独立的学科，不过三者在许多方面仍然相互交叉渗透。不少学者认为，广义的建筑学包括这三个学科，因此采取了融三学科于一卷的编纂方式。
    全卷框架分为８个分支。建筑部分计有中国建筑史、外国建筑史、建筑设计、建筑构造、建筑物理、建筑设备６个分支，园林部分和城市规划部分各为一个分支。
    在条目设置上，三个学科都设有综述条目、实例条目、类型条目和学说概念条目。综述条目是多层次的，这样，读者可从不同层次查检本书，获取信息。三个学科都列有大量实例条目，并对每个实例作出基本情况介绍和技术上、艺术上的剖析。学说概念条目列有《浪漫主义建筑》、《广亩城市》、《“有机疏散”论》、《斗口》、《材份》等，具有释疑解惑的功能。
    本卷卷首刊有三篇概观性文章：戴念慈、齐康的《建筑学》，汪菊渊的《园林学》，吴良镛的《城市规划》。
