Spring breeze urges people to busily accumulate fertilizer
Hunan Province Accumulates a Large Amount of Organic Fertilizer

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, March 18th - Hunan Province has seen a significant accumulation of organic fertilizer in recent years. According to statistics from Changde, Yiyang, and Shaoyang, 283 million dan of organic fertilizer have already been accumulated, averaging approximately 25 dan per mu. Some counties and cities have even reached 50 dan per mu.

Various regions have responded to the general decline in soil fertility and the tight supply of chemical fertilizers this year by mobilizing the masses to accumulate a large amount of soil and miscellaneous fertilizers. This is seen as a crucial measure to increase agricultural investment and ensure a bumper grain harvest.

Firstly, extensive propaganda has been conducted from top to bottom. Shaoyang City issued a notice in January to counties and townships about accumulating soil and miscellaneous fertilizers. Before the Spring Festival, a special telephone conference was held to mobilize and specifically arrange for this effort.

Secondly, specific reward and punishment measures have been implemented to motivate rural grassroots cadres and the masses to actively accumulate organic fertilizers. Various regions have generally included the fertilizer accumulation task indicators in the cadre responsibility system, linking them with bonuses and wages; linking fertilizer accumulation with the chemical fertilizer and loan quotas for households; linking fertilizer accumulation with winter repairs and labor contributions; and at the same time, widely conducting county, township, and village fertilizer accumulation competitions, rewarding the best and punishing the worst.

Thirdly, county and city organs, enterprises, and public institutions have been organized to accumulate soil and miscellaneous fertilizers, sending fertilizers to the countryside to support agricultural production and contribute to achieving a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

　　春风催人　积肥真忙
    湖南大积有机肥
    本报长沙３月１８日电  湖南省大积有机肥，出现了近年少有势头。据常德、益阳、邵阳三个地市统计，已积有机肥２．８３亿担，亩约２５担，部分县市亩均已达５０担。
    各地针对近年地力普遍下降、今年化肥货源供应紧张的情况，把发动群众大积土杂肥作为增加农业投入，确保粮食丰收的重要措施。
    首先，从上至下进行广泛宣传。邵阳市元月就大积土杂肥向县乡各级发出通知，春节前又专门召开电话会议动员和具体布置。
    二是制定具体奖罚措施，调动农村基层干部和群众大搞有机肥的积极性。各地普遍将积肥任务指标列入干部的责任制，与奖金、工资挂钩；将积肥与农户的化肥、贷款指标挂钩；将积肥与冬修的投工挂钩；同时，广泛开展县乡村积肥对手竞赛，奖优罚劣。
    三是组织县市机关、企事业单位大积土杂肥，送肥下乡，支援农业生产，为夺取今年农业丰收做贡献。
