Donike Highly Praises the Preparation of the Asian Games Drug Testing Center

BEIJING, March 30 — Professor Manfred Donike of the Cologne Institute of Sports Science in the Federal Republic of Germany, known as the "King of Drug Testing" in the international sports community, recently concluded his working visit to China. In an interview with a reporter from this newspaper, he highly praised the effective work done by the Institute of Sports Medicine of the State Sports Commission and the Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in preparing the drug testing center for the 11th Asian Games. He also expressed confidence in the center's ability to pass the examination by the Medical Commission and the Biochemistry Commission of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) this autumn.

Professor Donike is an authority and expert on drug testing for the IOC. His visit to China this time was mainly to inspect the preparation of the drug testing center for the 11th Asian Games and to provide specific technical guidance and suggestions for improvement. To understand the actual working ability of the staff and the level of the equipment at the Asian Games drug testing center, Donike handed over urine samples he brought to the center's staff for testing. When the center submitted the test results on time and all of them were correct, Donike was pleasantly surprised and satisfied. He believed that the testing center was fully capable of passing the examination on schedule. It is reported that at present, only fifteen drug testing centers worldwide have passed the examination and been recognized by the IOC.

Donike also revealed that the IOC is working to improve drug testing. It will strengthen supervision of athletes' misuse of drugs through random, targeted testing during training. He also mentioned that the types and quantities of drugs currently banned by the IOC are still limited to five categories and ninety-nine types of drugs.

　　多尼克高度评价我亚运会药检筹建中心
    本报北京三月三十日讯  记者吴骅报道：在国际体育界享有“兴奋剂检查之王”的联邦德国科隆体育学院的多尼克教授，日前结束他在中国的工作访问并接受本报记者采访时，高度评价了国家体委运动医学研究所和中国医科院药物研究所在筹建第十一届亚运会兴奋剂检查中心中卓有成效的工作，并对今年秋天该中心通过国际奥委会医学委员会兴奋剂和生化委员会的考试表现出信心。
    多尼克教授是国际奥委会兴奋剂检查的权威和专家，他此次来中国主要是检查第十一届亚运会兴奋剂检测中心的筹建情况，并提出改进意见和进行具体的技术性指导。为了解亚运会兴奋剂检测中心工作人员的实际工作能力和仪器设备水平，多尼克将带来的尿样交检测中心工作人员检测。当检测中心按规定的时间交出检测结果，并全部正确时，多尼克异常惊讶和满意。他认为，该检测中心完全有可能如期通过考试。据悉，目前通过考试，得到国际奥委会承认的兴奋剂检查中心，全世界仅有十五个。
    多尼克还透露，国际奥委会正着手改进兴奋剂检查工作，它将通过加强训练时不定期的重点检测，监督运动员滥用兴奋剂。他还说，国际奥委会禁用药物的种类和数量目前仍限制在五大类九十九种药物。
