At noon on December 10, 1988, the atmosphere in the auditorium of the University of Oslo was solemn and lively. Here, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time to a military organization—the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces.

Former United Nations Deputy Secretary-General Brian Urquhart, who attended the award ceremony, said, "This is a long-awaited recognition." Urquhart, who had worked at the United Nations for 41 years, had long been in charge of the peacekeeping forces, earning him the nickname "Mr. Peacekeeper."

Urquhart was born in Dorset, England, in February 1919. After retiring from the military in July 1945, he was transferred to the Foreign Office's Research Department. That same year, the Preparatory Commission of the United Nations was established, and Urquhart became the personal secretary to Acting Secretary-General Gladwyn Jebb, becoming the second official to be transferred to the United Nations organization. Over the next 40 years, he served as the Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Deputy Secretary-General in charge of special political affairs, consistently overseeing the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces. In 1984, he received the Roosevelt Freedom Medal. After retiring in 1986, he became a scholar at the Ford Foundation.

The establishment of the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces proves that the world is not at peace. "The international community uses military force as a catalyst for peace rather than a tool for war. This is a very interesting idea," Urquhart said. The peacekeeping forces are somewhat like the civil police of the early 20th century. "Many people do not understand what those blue-helmeted young men are doing. They are not ordinary soldiers. Unless in extreme self-defense situations, they are not allowed to open fire or engage in combat. They must continuously dialogue with both sides of the conflict to eliminate misunderstandings."

Over the past 40 years, this "Mr. Peacekeeper" often appeared with the "blue helmets" in Lebanon, Cyprus, and other hotspots. He assisted the current United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar in tirelessly seeking solutions to issues in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq War, Western Sahara, and others. Therefore, he deservedly went to Oslo with the United Nations Secretary-General to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

When asked about his views on the future of the world, Urquhart said, "I believe that people's interests are diverse, and it is important to wisely consider the interests of others when dealing with problems. Why not do the same in international affairs?" He also said, "Some people think that humans are born to suffer and kill each other. If someone really thinks this way, they might as well dig a deep hole and jump into it."

In the past year, many international hotspots have cooled down. This, of course, includes the efforts of "Mr. Peacekeeper" and his "blue helmets," who are committed to extinguishing the flames of war.

    “维持和平先生”
    ——原联合国副秘书长厄克特
    温宪
    1988年12月10日中午。挪威奥斯陆大学礼堂内气氛庄重而热烈。在这里，诺贝尔和平奖第一次授予了一个军事组织——联合国维持和平部队。
    参加授奖仪式的原联合国副秘书长布赖恩·厄克特说：“这是一个期待已久的承认。”厄克特在联合国供职的41年中，曾长期具体负责这支维持和平部队，因此得了个绰号：“维持和平先生”。
    厄克特1919年2月生于英国多塞特郡。1945年7月从军队退役后，他被调到外交部研究处。同年联合国筹备委员会成立，厄克特给代理秘书长格拉德温·杰布当私人秘书，成为联合国机构成立后正式调任的第二名工作人员。在此后40多年中，他作为联合国秘书长助理和负责特别政治事务的联合国副秘书长，一直分工负责联合国维持和平部队。1984年，他获得罗斯福自由奖章。1986年退休后，他成为福特基金会的学者。
    联合国维持和平部队的创建证明着世界并不太平。“国际社会将军事力量用作和平的催化剂而不是战争工具，这是一个十分有趣的思想”。厄克特说，维持和平部队有点像上个世纪初各国的民事警察，“许多人不懂得那些戴蓝盔的小伙子们在干什么。他们不是普通战士。除非在需要自卫的极端情况下，他们是不得开火，不得介入战斗的。他们必须不断与冲突双方对话，以消除误会”。40多年来，这位“维持和平先生”常常与“蓝盔”们一道出现在黎巴嫩、塞浦路斯和其它热点地区。他协助现任联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔不倦地为阿富汗、两伊、西撒哈拉等问题寻找出路。所以，他随联合国秘书长一起到奥斯陆接受诺贝尔和平奖，是当之无愧的。
    当被问及对世界前景的看法时，厄克特说：“我认为人们的利益是有差异的，重要的是在处理问题时要明智地照顾到他人的利益。在国际事务中为何不如此行事呢？”他还说：“有些人认为人类生来就是遭难、就是互相残杀。如果真有人这样认为，那他干脆挖一个深坑跳下去算了。”
    在刚刚过去的一年中，许多国际热点普遍降温。这当中自然有着以扑灭战火为己任的“维持和平先生”及其“蓝钢盔”们的功劳。（附图片）
