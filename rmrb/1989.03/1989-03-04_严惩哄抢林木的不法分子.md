    Severely Punish Those Who Riotously Plunder Timber
    The state-owned forest in Gulin County of our province covers an area of over 100,000 mu. Since 1980, state-owned timber has been repeatedly plundered by local villagers. Last year alone, over 300 cubic meters of timber, worth 150,000 yuan, were plundered. According to the forestry workers, more than 20 households in Renyi Village, Longmei Township, except for one retired teacher and one five-guarantee household, almost all participated in the plundering and illegal felling of timber. Some timber thieves even assaulted forest protection personnel at will. On one day in July last year, the hand of Yi Siyun, deputy director of the forest farm, was injured by timber thieves; on November 2, all the daily necessities bought by Xu Yunan and other technical personnel from the second district of Caizi Ping were stolen by those who came to steal timber. We appeal to relevant departments to take measures, punish the illegal timber thieves, and protect the country's forest resources.

　　严惩哄抢林木的不法分子
    我省古蔺县国营林场营林面积１０万多亩。自１９８０年以来，国有林木不断遭到当地村民的哄抢，仅去年一年，被哄抢的林木就达３００多立方米，价值１５万元。据林场的同志介绍，附近龙美乡仁义五组的２０多户农民，除了一户退休教师和一户五保户外，几乎全部参与哄抢盗伐林木活动。一些盗木者还任意殴打护林人员。去年７月的一天，林场副场长易思云的手被盗木者打伤；１１月２日，菜子坪２区技术干部许育南等人买回林场的生活日用品全部被前来偷伐林木的人抢光。呼吁有关部门采取措施，惩处盗伐林木的不法分子，保护国家的森林资源。四川环境保护导报　王群
