The Joy and Worry of a Veteran Player
— Li Shaofen, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, Talks About the Domestic Women's Basketball Situation

Li Shaofen, a former national women's basketball player and current Vice Chairman of the Chinese Basketball Association, shared her thoughts after watching the national basketball league matches in Lengshuitan.

She said, "The physical conditions of today's women's basketball players are truly excellent. When we were playing, who had teammates that were 1.8 or 1.9 meters tall? When competing against foreign teams, we were always shorter, having to use our small stature to fight against taller opponents. But now, our girls' average height is on par with the Soviet team, and even many provincial teams have the height to compete with European and American teams. The history of Chinese girls being at a height disadvantage has ended so quickly."

However, during the matches, she spent more time frowning. She said, "Seeing the players' stamina rapidly decline as the game progresses, their movements becoming distorted, and even the loss of basic skills like back-to-the-basket passing, it makes me anxious."

She summarized her concerns into one point: While Chinese women's basketball has turned around its past disadvantages, it has also lost some of its past advantages. She explained, "The seven women's basketball teams participating in Lengshuitan, although they have varying strengths, both strong and weak teams have monotonous playing styles. Most players have rough movements and struggle to maintain stamina throughout the intense competition."

"Clearly, while we have found a large number of tall players, we have not yet found suitable training methods for them. Or, the current training methods are not adapting to the trend of players becoming taller. Currently, domestic women's basketball training lacks innovation, and there is no comprehensive scientific training method."

According to Li Shaofen, the Chinese Basketball Association plans to invest significant effort in changing the knowledge structure of coaches at all levels of women's basketball and promoting new training methods to regain the lost training advantages.

　　老国手的喜与忧        
    ——中国篮协副主席李少芬谈国内女篮状况
    当年女篮国手、现任中国篮协副主席李少芬，在观看了全国篮球联赛冷水滩赛区后，发表了许多感想。
    她说：“现在女篮队员的身材条件真是太好了。我们打球那阵，哪有一米八九十的队友，和外国队比赛，总是低人一头，只能以小打大。可现在我们的女篮姑娘平均身高和苏联队并列第一，就是多数省级队，也取得了在身高上同欧美队平起平坐的资格。中国姑娘在身高上吃亏的历史，这么快就结束了。”
    但在观赛中，更多时间她是紧皱眉头。她说：“看到随着比赛进展，队员体力急剧下降，动作明显变形，甚至连背身策应技术都失传了，心里着急。”
    她把自己的声声叹息归结为一个意思，中国女子篮球运动在扭转过去劣势的同时，却失去了过去的优势。她举例道：在冷水滩参赛的７支女篮，虽实力有强弱之分，但无论是强队还是弱队，都打法单调，绝大部分队员动作粗糙，且体力难以应付全场激烈对抗。
    “很显然，我们在找到大量高大选手的同时，还没有摸索出因材施教的训练方法，或者说，现有的训练方法已不适应队员日益高大化的趋势。目前国内的女篮训练很少有创新之举，更谈不到整套的科学训练法。”
    据李少芬介绍，中国篮协准备花大力气改变各级女篮教练的知识结构，推广新的训练方法，以期把失去的训练优势找回来。
