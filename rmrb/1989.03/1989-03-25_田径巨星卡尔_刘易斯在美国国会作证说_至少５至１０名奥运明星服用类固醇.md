Track and field star Carl Lewis testified in the U.S. Congress today, stating that at least 5 to 10 Olympic medalists used the banned drug steroids during the 1988 Seoul Olympics. He suggested that the United States establish an independent body to monitor athletes' use of banned substances.

The black athlete, who has won 6 Olympic gold medals, told the House Judiciary Committee that the use of steroids is common in international track and field. According to his information, besides Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, there are other athletes involved. However, Lewis did not name any other athletes, only telling the U.S. Congress that "among the athletes using steroids, there are definitely gold medalists."

Lewis told the media that 7 years ago, Johnson's sprint ranking in the world was only around 50th or 60th. Due to long-term use of steroids, he was able to become the world's top seed and break the men's 100-meter world record twice.

Lewis said that using steroids has fatal side effects, often leading to liver cancer or loss of fertility. Therefore, during his testimony, he suggested that the United States establish an independent body to monitor athletes' drug use. However, this body must be independent of any national sports association or international sports organization. He also suggested random drug testing for all athletes, including high school, college, and world-class athletes, to prevent the use of banned substances. He pointed out that in fact, the use of banned substances in the sports world has become widespread, so it is necessary to conduct comprehensive drug testing.

　　田径巨星卡尔·刘易斯在美国国会作证说        
    至少５至１０名奥运明星服用类固醇
    新华社华盛顿３月２３日电  （记者陆文岳）美国田径巨星卡尔·刘易斯今天在国会作证说，在去年汉城奥运会上，至少有５至１０名田径奖牌获得者服用过违禁药品类固醇，为此建议美国成立检查运动员服用违禁药物的独立机构。
    这位曾经获得６枚奥运金牌的黑人运动员在众议院司法委员会听证会上说，服用类固醇在国际田径界已经司空见惯，据他所掌握的名单，除加拿大短跑运动员本·约翰逊外还有其他选手。但是刘易斯没有检举其他运动员，他只是告诉美国议员“在服用类固醇运动员中，肯定有金牌获得者”。
    刘易斯告诉报界，７年前，约翰逊的短跑名次在世界上只居第５０位或６０位，由于长期服用类固醇，所以能够一跃成为世界头号种子，并且两次打破男子１００米赛跑世界纪录。
    刘易斯说，服用类固醇有致命的副作用，往往导致肝癌或失去生育能力。为此，他在作证时建议美国成立一个独立机构来检查运动员的服药情况，但是这个机构必须独立于任何国家体育协会或国际体育组织。他还建议对所有运动员，包括中学、大学和世界级运动员随时进行抽查，以杜绝服用违禁药品的现象。他指出，事实上，服用违禁药品在体育界已经成风，因此有必要进行全面抽查。
