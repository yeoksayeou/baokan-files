Strengthening Institutional and Legal Construction of Work
Draft of the Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress Proposed
Wang Hanbin Explains Major Issues at the People's Congress

The vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and director of the Legislative Affairs Commission, Wang Hanbin, made an explanation regarding the draft of the Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress.

Wang Hanbin said, to strengthen the institutional and legal construction of the work of the National People's Congress, and to facilitate the National People's Congress in exercising its powers according to democratic and legal procedures, the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, at the request of the Presidium, drafted the "Draft Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress."

He then explained some major issues in the draft:

- The Constitution and the Organic Law of the National People's Congress stipulate that the National People's Congress shall hold a session once a year. However, it does not specify the time for holding the session. Based on the opinions of the deputies and the actual situation over the past few years, the draft stipulates that the session of the National People's Congress shall be held in the first quarter of each year.

- In recent years, many deputies and local authorities have repeatedly suggested that to prepare for the session of the National People's Congress, the main documents to be reviewed at the session should be sent to the deputies one month in advance. Considering the feasibility, the draft stipulates: 1. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress shall send the draft laws to be reviewed at the session to the deputies one month before the session. 2. One month before the session of the National People's Congress, the relevant departments of the State Council shall report to the Financial and Economic Committee and the relevant specialized committees on the main contents of the national economic and social development plan and its implementation, the national budget and its implementation, and the Financial and Economic Committee shall conduct a preliminary review. 3. The State Council shall, at the same time as it submits the report on the national economic and social development plan and its implementation and the report on the national budget and its implementation to the session of the National People's Congress, print and distribute the draft of the main indicators of the national economic and social development plan, the draft of the national budget income and expenditure table, and the draft of the national budget implementation table.

- Neither the Constitution nor the Organic Law of the National People's Congress stipulates the issue of resignation of the leaders of state organs, nor does it stipulate how to determine the acting person when the Premier of the State Council, the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, the President of the Supreme People's Court, or the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate is absent due to some reason. To adapt to such personnel changes, the draft stipulates that during the session of the National People's Congress, if the leaders of state organs submit their resignation, the Presidium shall submit their resignation request to the various delegations for deliberation and then submit it to the plenary session of the Congress for decision. If the resignation is submitted during the recess of the Congress, the Presidium shall submit the resignation request to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation and decision, and report it to the next session of the National People's Congress for confirmation. During the recess of the Congress, if the Premier of the State Council, the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, the President of the Supreme People's Court, or the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate resigns or is absent, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress may decide on the acting person.

- Both the Constitution and the Organic Law of the National People's Congress stipulate that the National People's Congress may establish special committees to investigate specific issues. To facilitate the implementation of this provision, the draft stipulates the composition and working procedures of the special committees.

- To increase the openness of the session of the National People's Congress and to reflect the spirit of open government, the draft, in addition to stipulating that the session of the National People's Congress shall generally be "held in public," makes the following provisions: 1. During the session of the National People's Congress, the speeches of the deputies at various meetings shall be compiled and printed for distribution at the session, and, at the request of the deputies, the records or summaries of their speeches shall be printed and distributed at the session. 2. "The plenary session of the Congress shall have seats for spectators," and the specific methods for spectators shall be stipulated separately. 3. The voting results of the election or appointment by the National People's Congress, including the number of votes received by the candidates, shall be announced. 4. In accordance with the current practice, it is stipulated that the session of the National People's Congress shall hold press conferences and press briefings.

　　加强工作制度化法律化建设        
    全国人大议事规则草案拟就 
    王汉斌在人代会上就主要问题作说明
    新华社北京３月２８日电  全国人大常委会副委员长、法制工作委员会主任王汉斌在七届全国人大二次会议上作了关于中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会议事规则草案的说明。
    王汉斌说，为了加强全国人大工作的制度化、法律化建设，便于全国人大依照民主的、法定的程序行使职权，全国人大常委会法制工作委员会受委员长会议委托，草拟了《全国人民代表大会议事规则（草案）》。
    他接着就草案的一些主要问题作了说明：
    ——宪法和全国人大组织法规定全国人大会议每年举行一次。没有规定会议举行的时间。草案根据代表的意见和这几年的实际情况，规定全国人大会议于每年第一季度举行。
    ——近几年来，许多代表和地方一再提出，为了有准备地开好全国人大会议，建议将会议审议的主要文件提前一个月发给代表。草案从实际可行性考虑，规定：１、全国人大常委会应当在全国人大会议举行的一个月前，将准备提请会议审议的法律草案发给代表。２、全国人大会议举行的一个月前，国务院有关主管部门应当就国民经济和社会发展计划及计划执行情况、国家预算及预算执行情况的主要内容，向财政经济委员会和有关的专门委员会汇报，由财政经济委员会进行初步审查。３、国务院在向全国人大会议提出关于国民经济和社会发展计划及计划执行情况的报告、关于国家预算及预算执行情况的报告的同时，应将国民经济和社会发展计划主要指标（草案）、国家预算收支表（草案）和国家预算执行情况表（草案）一并印发会议。
    ——宪法和全国人大组织法都没有规定国家机构领导人员的辞职问题，也没有规定国务院总理、中央军委主席、最高人民法院院长、最高人民检察院检察长因故缺位时如何确定代理人选的问题。为了适应这类人事变动的需要，草案规定，全国人大会议期间，国家机构领导人员提出辞职的，由主席团将其辞职请求交各代表团审议后，提交大会全体会议决定，大会闭会期间提出辞职的，由委员长会议将其辞职请求提交全国人大常委会议审议决定，报请全国人大下次会议确认。大会闭会期间，国务院总理、中央军委主席、最高人民法院院长、最高人民检察院检察长辞职或者缺位的，全国人大常委会可以决定代理人选。
    ——宪法和全国人大组织法都规定，全国人大可以组织关于特定问题的调查委员会。为了便于执行这一规定，草案对调查委员会的组成和工作程序作了规定。
    ——为了增加全国人大会议的开放程度，体现政务公开的精神，草案除规定全国人大会议一般“公开举行”外，作了以下规定：１、全国人大会议期间，代表在各种会议上的发言，整理简报印发会议，并可以根据本人要求，将发言记录或者摘要印发会议。２、“大会全体会议设旁听席”，具体旁听办法另行规定。３、全国人大选举或者决定任命的表决结果，候选人的得票数应当公布。４、根据现行做法，规定全国人大会议举行新闻发布会、记者招待会。
