Yevgeny Yevtushenko (1932-) is a giant of contemporary Soviet poetry, renowned for his political poems that criticize societal ills. He is known as the "international singer." He pioneered the "resounding" style of poetry and is a leading figure of the "loud and clear" school of the 1950s and 1960s in the Soviet Union.

Yevtushenko was born into a family of geologists. His father loved poetry and wrote it himself, while his mother was a singer, both of whom influenced his upbringing. As a child, he worked in a lumberyard on a collective farm and in a geological survey team. He began writing poetry at the age of thirteen, published his first work at seventeen, and released his first poetry collection, *The Explorers of the Future*, at twenty. In 1954, after graduating from the Gorky Literary Institute, he entered society at a time when the Soviet Union was undergoing significant political changes following the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He fearlessly addressed the major and sensitive issues that concerned the people, especially the youth, such as life, the world, morality, thoughts, love, art, and nature. His poems broke away from the conventional realism tradition, drawing on modernist techniques, with a wide range of subjects. He wrote about both domestic realities and international politics, using bold, frank, and sharp language, which often sparked heated debates among critics. Some praised him highly, while others criticized him severely, but all acknowledged his quick thinking and exceptional talent.

Yevtushenko primarily engages in poetry, writing both political and lyrical poems. He is also a novelist and playwright. He advocates for innovation, and his works have unique artistic features, reflecting the times, expressing his thoughts freely, with grand ideas, deep meanings, rich and profound poetry, and novel and concise language. He once said, "I want to combine some characteristics of Mayakovsky, Blok, Yesenin, and Pasternak in my poetry." He has written many notable long poems, such as *Zima Station*, *Bratsk Hydroelectric Station*, and *Kazan University*, as well as the novel *The Berry Country* and the film script *Kindergarten*. His long poem *Mother and the Neutron Bomb* won the 1984 State Prize of the USSR. This poem combines lyricism and narrative, depicting the mother symbolizing life and the neutron bomb symbolizing human destruction, calling on people to prevent war. He has also published poetry collections such as *The Third Snow*, *The Book of Promises*, *The Book of Farewells*, *Inner Lyrics*, and *Welded by Explosion*. Last year, his poems *The Unfinished Monument*, commemorating the millions of innocent victims of the Great Purge, and *The Widow of Bukharin*, advocating for Bukharin's rehabilitation, caused a stir when published in the Soviet Union and the English-speaking world.

    黎华
    叶甫盖尼·叶甫图申科（一九三二—）是苏联当代诗坛巨匠，以写针砭时弊的政论诗闻名，被誉为“国际歌手”。他开创“响”派诗风，是苏联五六十年代“大声疾呼”派的主要代表人物。
    叶甫图申科生于一个地质工作者家庭。他父亲喜爱诗歌，自己也写诗，母亲是位歌手，对儿子的成长都有所熏陶。他小时曾在农庄运木场和地质勘探队工作过。十三岁开始写诗，十七岁发表处女作，二十岁出版第一部诗集《未来的探索者》。一九五四年，他从高尔基文学院毕业跨进社会时，正值苏共二十大后反对个人崇拜，国家政治生活剧烈变动，他以丰富的创作大胆地触及人民大众、特别是青年们所关切的和敏感的重大、尖锐问题，主题多表现社会动荡中同时代人内心对人生、世界、道德、思想、爱情、艺术、自然等的复杂感情和反响。由于他的诗冲破习以为常的现实主义传统，汲取现代派创作方法，题材广泛，既写国内现实生活，也干预国际政治，泼辣、率直、尖刻、雄辩，因而屡屡引起评论界的激烈争议，有的极力赞赏，有的严厉斥责，但都承认他思想敏捷，才华卓越。
    叶甫图申科主要从事诗歌创作，既写政论诗，也写抒情诗，同时，他还是小说家、剧作家。他崇尚创新，作品有自己的艺术特色，反映时代，直抒胸臆，思想恢宏，寓意深刻，诗情浓郁、深沉，用语新奇、精练。他曾说：“我想在自己的诗中把马雅可夫斯基、勃洛克、叶赛宁和帕斯捷尔纳克的某些特点结合在一起。”他写有许多引人注目的长篇作品，如长诗《济马站》、《布拉茨克水电站》和《喀山大学》，小说《浆果之乡》，电影剧本《幼儿园》等。长诗《妈妈和中子弹》曾获一九八四年苏联国家奖金，该诗采取抒情与叙事相结合的手法，写象征着生命的母亲和象征着人类毁灭的中子弹，号召人们起来防止战争。他还著有诗集《第三场雪》、《诺言集》、《挥手集》、《内心抒情诗》、《用爆炸法焊接》等。前年，他发表的诗《还未落成的纪念碑》纪念大清洗中千百万无辜受害者，《布哈林的遗孀》为布哈林恢复名誉呼吁，在苏联和英美发表后引起震动。
