The British government was accused on March 14 of failing to respond actively to terror warnings received before the Lockerbie air disaster last December.

The bomb warning came from a document issued by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to foreign governments, including Britain. The document, revealed today, said that some terrorists would hand a bomb to a Finnish woman in Helsinki to be carried on flight 103.

Transport spokesman for the Labour Party, Prescott, said that Transport Minister Channon told him on January 10 that the warning was then considered to be "not very credible," and therefore the document was not handed over to the officials in charge of security at Heathrow Airport.

Prescott has written to Prime Minister Thatcher, demanding an independent and thorough investigation into the government's response to the document provided by the U.S.

　　空难事件前曾得到警告但无反应
    英国政府受到指控
    据新华社伦敦３月１４日电  英国政府１４日被指控未能对去年１２月洛克比空难事件之前所收到的恐怖警告作出积极的反应。
    这一炸机警告来自美国联邦航空局向包括英国在内的外国政府所发出的文件。今天披露的这份文件说，一些恐怖分子会将一枚炸弹交给赫尔辛基的一位芬兰妇女，由她带上１０３航班。
    工党运输发言人普雷斯科特说，运输大臣钱农１月１０日告诉他说，警告当时被认为“可信性不大”，因此没有将那份文件交给希思罗机场负责安全的官员。
    普雷斯科特已写信给撒切尔夫人，要求独立、全面地调查政府对美国提供文件的反应。
