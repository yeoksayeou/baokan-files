The international situation is undergoing a major shift, and many countries around the world are assessing the situation, observing international trends, and reflecting on and adjusting their foreign policies and international relations. As a superpower, the United States has seen various discussions on this issue from both the government and the public. The March 1 column article "The Tide of Change in World Affairs" in the *Christian Science Monitor* expresses some insightful views.

After analyzing the changes in various factors influencing post-war American foreign policy, the article points out that, given the change in the nature of threats to the United States, "the major challenge facing the United States is not in the area of military security, but in trade and economic policy and our relations with the Third World."

The author, in my opinion, although did not provide answers on how to address this challenge, is worth noting for linking American trade and economic policy as the primary issue and connecting it with policy towards the Third World.

The post-war international situation has evolved to the point where the severe confrontation in military power and ideology between the East and West has gradually given way to a balance and equilibrium based on mutual recognition and respect for each other's interests. The massive expenditure on nuclear weapons and conventional arms has proven unable to replace the comprehensive competition in political, economic, military, technological, and cultural strengths. The fundamental reason for this change is that the foreign policies of the United States and the Soviet Union, based on power politics, have accelerated the process of political and economic imbalance in the world, leading to the gradual decline of superpowers and the rise of new economic groups and powers. The new economic groups are competing in investment, trade, and the acquisition of raw materials in the global market, weakening America's dominant position in the world economy and trade. Therefore, formulating an economic and trade policy that considers the interests of various economic groups and frees everyone from the nightmare of trade protectionism seems to be an urgent task for the United States to get out of its trade and fiscal crises.

However, if the United States does not consider the Third World countries when formulating new economic and trade policies, then such policies will be ineffective. This is because the current structure of world trade is extremely distorted. In 1986, the European Economic Community accounted for 52.3% of the total world trade, the United States for 19.6%, and Japan for 11.3%. This means that a few major developed countries together accounted for 83.2% of the total world trade. The share of more than 100 developing countries in the total world trade is negligible. The United States and some Western countries have mainly provided funds to Third World countries based on their own needs, resulting in these countries incurring huge external debts without establishing a healthy economy. Instead, they have provided funds to developed countries through debt repayment. As a result, the United States and other Western countries are engaged in fierce competition in the narrow global market, while many Third World countries are actually excluded from the reciprocal global market. If this phenomenon is not eliminated, the old international economic order will be difficult to change.

After the easing of East-West relations, South-North relations will become increasingly prominent, requiring people to address them. In this sense, the reflection conducted in the *Christian Science Monitor* article is beneficial.

　　值得重视的观点
    塞北
    国际形势正处于重大转折，世界上许多国家都在估计形势，观察国际潮流趋向，并在对外政策和国际关系方面进行反思和调整。作为超级大国的美国，朝野各方就此已经发表了许多议论。《基督教科学箴言报》３月１日的专栏文章《在世界事务中的变革潮流》就表达了颇有见地的一些观点。
    文章在分析了影响战后美国对外政策的各种因素的变化以后指出，鉴于对美国的威胁的性质已经改变，“美国面临的重要挑战并非在军事安全方面，而是在贸易经济政策和我们同第三世界的关系方面”。
    笔者认为，作者在文中虽然未就如何应付这种挑战提出答案，但是他把美国的贸易经济政策作为首要问题并把它同对第三世界的政策相联系，这个观点是值得重视的。
    战后国际形势发展到今天，东西关系中在军事实力和意识形态方面的严重对抗，已逐步让位于在互相承认和尊重对方利益的基础上的平衡和均势，核武器和常规军备上耗资巨大的较量已经证明取代不了包括政治、经济、军事、科技、文化等广泛内容的综合国力竞赛。发生这种变化的根本原因，是美苏以实力政策为基础的对外政策，加速了世界政治经济发展不平衡的过程，使超级大国渐趋衰落，新的经济集团和强国乘机兴起。新兴经济集团在投资、贸易、获取原料等方面在世界市场上的争夺，削弱了美国在世界经济、贸易中的优势地位。因此，制订一项照顾各个经济集团的利益的经济贸易政策，使大家从贸易保护主义的恶梦中解脱出来，似乎是美国当前摆脱外贸危机和财政危机的一项当务之急。
    但是美国在制订新的经济贸易政策的时候，如果不把第三世界国家考虑在内，那末这种政策将收效甚微。因为当前世界贸易的格局是极端畸形的。１９８６年世界贸易总额中，欧洲经济共同体占５２．３％，美国占１９．６％，日本占１１．３％。这就是说，几个主要发达国家就共占了世界贸易总额的８３．２％。１００多个发展中国家在世界贸易总额中所占的份额微乎其微。美国和一些西方国家过去主要按自己的需要向第三世界国家提供资金，结果使它们欠下了巨额外债而未能建立起健康的经济，反而通过偿还债务本息源源向发达国家提供资金。其结果，美国和其他西方国家在狭隘的世界市场上进行激烈的争夺，而许多第三世界国家实际上被排除在有来有往的世界市场之外。这种现象如果不消除，国际经济旧秩序将很难改变。
    东西关系缓和之后，南北关系将会愈来愈突出，要求人们去解决。从这个意义上来说，《基督教科学箴言报》文章所进行的反思是有益的。
