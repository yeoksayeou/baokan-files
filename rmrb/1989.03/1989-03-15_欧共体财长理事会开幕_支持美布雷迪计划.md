The European Community (EC) Finance Ministers' Council opened in Brussels on March 13th. The ministers discussed the issue of third-world debt and expressed support for the "Brady Plan" proposed by the United States.

The participants emphasized that the key to solving the debt problem lies in the debtor countries implementing economic reforms. At the same time, they acknowledged that voluntary debt reduction by creditor countries could play a significant role. They suggested that if commercial banks were to waive part of the debt, certain measures could be taken in terms of taxation and settlement. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank should provide support in this regard. They also advocated for increasing the financial resources of the IMF to enhance its status, hoping that the United States would adjust its stance.

Currently, the total debt of the third world has reached $1.3 trillion, not only becoming a heavy burden for some developing countries but also posing a significant threat to the global economy, prompting industrialized nations to take the issue seriously. The new U.S. administration has now accepted the idea of partially forgiving some of the debt.

Additionally, the 12 finance ministers issued a written opinion opposing illegal fraudulent activities that harm the EC budget, sending it to the Commission, the European Parliament, and the member states. According to statistics, these illegal activities cause the EC budget to lose approximately $10 billion annually.

　　欧共体财长理事会开幕
    支持美布雷迪计划
    本报布鲁塞尔３月１４日电  记者魏崴报道：１３日在此间举行的欧共体财长理事会，讨论了第三世界债务问题，支持美国就此提出的“布雷迪计划”。
    与会者强调，解决债务问题的关键，在于债务国实行经济改革，同时，债权国自愿减少一些债务也可发挥重大作用。他们认为，如果想从商业银行中免除这部分债务，可在税收和结算上采取若干措施。国际货币基金组织和世界银行对此应予以支持。他们还主张增加国际货币基金组织的财源，以增加该组织的地位，希望美国的态度能作些调整。
    当前，第三世界债务总额已高达１３０００亿美元，不但成了一些发展中国家沉重负担，也对世界经济构成很大威胁，迫使工业发达国家们认真对待。美国新政府现在已接受了酌情减免部分债务的意见。
    此外，１２国财长还就反对损害欧共体预算的违法舞弊行为，通过一书面意见，发送委员会、欧洲议会和各成员国。据统计，这些不法行为，每年约使欧共体预算损失１００亿美元。
