**After Criticism**

Your newspaper published a letter from a reader on December 10th last year, titled "No One Manages Gambling on Trains," in the fifth edition. After reading this, our passenger transport section immediately took measures to promptly rectify the order on trains.

1. We have clearly stipulated that if gambling activities occur on trains and the train staff fail to discover and stop them in time, they will be held accountable for dereliction of duty.
2. We have strengthened train broadcasts to promote programs that prohibit gambling and warn against being deceived, mobilizing passengers to assist train staff in maintaining train security.
3. We have collaborated with relevant departments to form five small teams to inspect and rectify key trains and sections.

Since mid-December last year, our section has intercepted 10 instances of gambling on trains and publicly dealt with some of the gamblers. Currently, the order on all trains in our section has significantly improved.

　　整顿列车秩序　查禁赌博活动
    你报去年１２月１０日第五版刊登题为《列车上赌博无人管》的读者来信后，我客运段立即采取措施，及时整顿了列车秩序。
    一、明确规定，今后列车上发生赌博现象，而列车工作人员未能及时发现和制止，按失职论处。
    二、加强列车广播宣传，制作禁止赌博、谨防受骗等节目，动员旅客协助列车工作人员搞好列车治安工作。
    三、与有关部门配合，组成５个小分队，对重点列车和区段进行检查整顿。
    去年１２月中旬以来，我段在列车上查禁赌博１０起，当众处理了一些赌徒。目前，我段各次列车的乘车秩序有明显好转。
