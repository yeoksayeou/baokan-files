Title: Fishermen of the Sea (and one more)

The days of harvesting the sea
Are the days when fishermen's emotions are most abundant
Wives and children laugh and run
The sea breeze is clear, and the sun is full of poetry
The days of not harvesting the sea
Are the days when fishermen feel most desolate
But the years blend frost and snow, dawn and dusk
In the smoke of the pipe, dancing gracefully,
Is still the eternal fisherman's song
Want to get to know the sea?
Then read the expressions of the fishermen
The sea whispers to them every day, men,
The secrets of being a husband and a father

Night Moon
The waves are not to your liking
The sea wind always covets your tongue
The flickering fishing lights love to chat
But refuse to reveal their thoughts
People are the same
Away from the city, you can't see
Lipstick and rouge advertisements
As well as
Things made of plastic and other materials, pale
And
Ideas that inflate like balloons
Experience the moonlight on the beach
Throw whatever is in your mind into the sea
In loneliness, loneliness
Is surprisingly a delightful enjoyment

　　海上人（外一首）
    马砚田
    收海的日子
    是海上人感情最富足的日子
    妻子和儿女笑着跑着
    海风清朗着太阳极富诗意
    不收海的日子
    是海上人感觉最萧条的日子
    但岁月揉拌霜雪晨昏
    在烟锅里翩翩起舞的
    依旧是永恒的渔歌
    想结识海吗？
    那就读一读海上人的表情吧
    海每天和他们耳语　男子汉
    做丈夫和父亲的秘密
    　　　　夜月
    排浪不对胃口
    海风老觊觎你的舌头
    明灭的渔火爱唠叨
    就是不肯把心思掏出
    人也一样
    离开城市　便
    看不见涂着唇膏粉黛的广告
    　以及
    塑料和别的什么制成的苍白
    　以及
    气球般急剧膨胀的念头
    体味海滩月色
    把脑子里那团什么全扔到海里
    在孤独中孤独
    竟是味道不错的享受
