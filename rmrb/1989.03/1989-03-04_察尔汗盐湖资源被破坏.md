The development of the Qarhan Salt Lake in our province has progressed rapidly in recent years. The first phase of the provincial potash fertilizer plant has achieved an annual production capacity of 40,000 tons of potash fertilizer. The 200,000-ton potassium chloride first-phase project will be completed this year. Various regions and departments within the province are enthusiastic about mining. The development and research of magnesium chloride and other associated minerals have also made new progress, with promising prospects. However, due to the lack of macro-control and overall planning in the development of salt lake resources, and the absence of strict management systems, many issues that cannot be ignored have emerged in the development of the salt lake.

So far, sixteen or seventeen units and 5,400 people have rushed into the salt lake area. They have neither obtained mining rights nor exploration rights, nor have they gone through the approval process. Instead, they arbitrarily set up points and "stake out territory" in the salt lake, competing for resources and recklessly mining. Some units are rushing to mine new brine in the northern shore of the Dabuxun Salt Lake and processing it on-site using crude methods, randomly discharging waste liquid. This not only affects the development of the salt lake but also pollutes the environment.

Currently, the units that have rushed into the salt lake area for reckless mining include the Ge'ermu Salt Chemical General Factory, the Qarhan Salt Chemical Factory of Haixi Prefecture, the Lan Space Potash Fertilizer Factory, the Ge'ermu 141 Magnesium Chloride Factory, the Ge'ermu Magnesium Sand Factory, the 727 Potash Fertilizer Factory, the Qaidam Automobile Repair Factory, the Provincial Salt Lake Research Institute, the Provincial Geological Center Laboratory, the Dulan County Potassium Magnesium Factory, the Changsha Chemical Mine Design Institute of Hunan, and the Lianyungang Chemical Mine Design Institute of Jiangsu. These units mine salt annually, ranging from a few thousand tons to tens of millions of tons, occupying salt fields ranging from 1 square kilometer to six or seven square kilometers.

　　察尔汗盐湖资源被破坏
    近年来，我省察尔汗盐湖开发工作进展很快，省钾肥厂一选厂已形成年产４万吨钾肥的能力，２０万吨氯化钾一期工程今年即将完成，省内各地区、各部门办矿热情高涨。氯化镁及其它伴生矿产的开发、研究工作也有了新的进展，前途可观。但是，由于盐湖资源的开发缺乏宏观控制和统筹规划，没有严格的管理制度，致使盐湖的开发出现了许多不容忽视的问题。
    到目前为止，有十六七个单位、５４００多人涌入盐湖区，他们既没有取得采矿权和勘察权，又没有办理审批手续，便在盐湖内任意布点，“跑马圈界”，争抢资源，乱采滥挖。有的单位在达布逊盐湖北岸争先开采新生光卤石，并就地土法加工，随意排放废液，不但影响盐湖的开发，还污染了环境。
    现在，已涌入盐湖区乱采滥挖的单位有格尔木市盐化总厂、海西州察尔汗盐化厂、兰空钾肥厂、格尔木市１４１氯化镁厂、格尔木市镁砂厂、７２７钾肥厂、柴达木汽车修理厂、省盐湖研究所、省地质中心实验室、都兰县钾镁厂、湖南长沙化学矿山设计院、江苏连云港化学矿山设计院等。这些单位一年采挖矿盐少则数千吨，多则数十万吨，占据盐田少则１平方公里，多则达六七平方公里。
