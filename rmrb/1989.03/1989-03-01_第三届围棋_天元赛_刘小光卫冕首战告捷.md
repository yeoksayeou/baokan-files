The first match of the third "Tianyuan" Go Championship defense was held today in Changshu. The defending champion, Liu Xiaoguang, a 9th dan, playing black, defeated the challenger, Jiang Zhujiu, also a 9th dan, in the middle of the game.

In the early stages of today's match, both Liu and Jiang played steadily, setting the stage for a prolonged battle. However, as the game entered the middle phase, Jiang made a mistake, and the balance of the game began to shift in Liu's favor. During the endgame, Liu also made some errors, resulting in a series of small losses that evened the score. Just as the situation seemed to be stabilizing, Jiang made a critical mistake, misjudging a large endgame sequence and turning it into a single-point endgame, leading to a significant loss and ultimately sealing his defeat. Jiang conceded in the middle of the game.

The second match of the "Tianyuan" Championship defense will be held on March 2nd in Changshu City.

　　第三届围棋“天元赛”
    刘小光卫冕首战告捷
    本报常熟二月二十八日电  第三届围棋“天元赛”挑战赛今天在常熟进行了第一局比赛，结果上届名人称号的获得者刘小光九段执黑中盘战胜挑战者江铸久九段。
    在今天的比赛开始阶段，刘江二人步调都非常稳健。双方拉开一副打持久战的架势，但是进入中盘，江铸久棋错一着，胜负天平顿时向刘小光一方倾斜。进入收官时，刘小光由于也出现失误，官子连连损失，局面又趋平衡。孰料在这关键时刻江铸久又犯了一个决定性的错误，一个大官子看错而走成了个单官，遭致严重损失顿时铸成败局，中盘认负。
    “天元赛”挑战赛的第二局三月二日仍将在常熟市举行。
