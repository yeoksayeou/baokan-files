Education was one of the most hotly debated topics at this year's National People's Congress. On the morning of March 19th, Professor Yuan Weishi quickly turned the conversation to the recent discussions in our newspaper about the new "reading is useless" theory.

Professor Yuan has given this topic a lot of thought. He said that, in his observation, most students still study diligently and we should not exaggerate the severity of the problem. However, he acknowledged that there are indeed more students who do not read as much as before.

Why is this the case? He believes there are two main reasons. First, society has not yet formed a culture that respects knowledge and intellectuals. "As the people of Guangdong say, 'the poorest are professors, the most foolish are doctors,'" Yuan Professor said with a bitter smile. "My family has both. My eldest son is a 'domestic' doctor, and my second son is a 'foreign' doctor. My eldest son now earns 107 yuan a month, and with various subsidies and bonuses, it's still only around 180 yuan. He can't support his own son, and I have to support him."

When the conversation turned to this, he pointed to the "Government Work Report" he was reading and said, "It criticizes some schools for issuing diplomas indiscriminately and charging excessive fees, and the root cause is the lack of educational funds." As he spoke, his tone became more serious: "As the head of a public university, if you do not care about the school's reputation and dignity, you are absolutely unqualified. But now even some prestigious universities have to recruit students outside of the plan. These are all abnormal phenomena. They are all unavoidable!"

Professor Yuan admits that the second reason is that the current educational content is far from meeting the needs of a commodity economy. As the person in charge of Sun Yat-sen University's Xunwu College, he has set up a series of practical majors such as international trade English and applied chemistry according to the needs of the talent market.

He believes that to curb the trend of students losing interest in studying, improving the quality of teaching is key. Professor Yuan suggests that while vigorously developing practical disciplines, we must also maintain basic sciences, especially social sciences.

Professor Yuan expressed deep concern about the need to ensure a real increase in educational funding, rather than just talking about it on paper. He is preparing to submit a proposal to the Congress: hoping to strictly prohibit the import of foreign cigarettes, alcohol, and cosmetics. He said, "There is money to buy these unnecessary things, but there is no money for education?"

　　快人快语谈教育        
    ——访人大代表、中大教授袁伟时
    本报记者  李泓冰
    教育是这次人大会议上议论最多的热点之一。３月１９日上午，袁伟时教授三言两语便转到本报最近有关新的“读书无用论”的讨论上来。
    袁教授对此早已深思熟虑。他说，据他的观察，大部分学生还是用功读书的，不要过份渲染问题的严重性，但不读书的学生的确比过去多了。
    何以如此？他认为原因有二：其一是社会上没有形成尊重知识、尊重知识分子的风气。“广东人说，‘最穷是教授，最傻是博士’，我的家里兼而有之了。”袁教授苦笑着说：“我的两个儿子，老大是‘土’博士，老二是‘洋’博士。老大如今月薪１０７元，加上各种补贴、奖金，总共不过１８０元左右，他养不起自己的儿子，还得我养。”
    一谈及此，他指指正在读的《政府工作报告》说，里面批评了有些学校乱发文凭、乱收费，其根源也是由于教育经费匮乏。说着说着，他口气郑重起来：“作为一个公立大学的校长，如果不关心学校的声誉和尊严，那是绝对不合格的。但现在有些名牌大学也不得不计划外招生了，这都是非正常现象。都是迫不得已啊！”　
    袁教授承认第二个原因是目前的教育内容远不能适应商品经济的需要。作为中山大学分校孙文学院负责人，他按照人才市场的需要设置了像外贸英语、应用化学等一系列实用型专业。
    他认为要刹住厌学风，提高教学质量是关键。袁教授建议在大力发展实用学科的同时，还要保基础科学，尤其不能忽视社会科学。
    对教育经费必须保证切实增长，而不是纸上谈兵，袁教授深表关切。他正准备向大会提交一份议案：希望严禁进口洋烟、洋酒、洋化妆品。他说：“有钱买回这些不必要的东西，却没钱办教育？”
