OPEC countries strictly implement production cuts

According to figures released by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on the 20th, the daily oil supply of OPEC's 12 member countries in February was the same as in January, at 17.4 million barrels.

Another OPEC member, the United Arab Emirates, has not yet released its figures. According to OPEC Secretary-General Subroto, the daily oil supply of these 12 countries is below the quota of 17.51 million barrels set in November last year.

Some oil experts believe this shows that OPEC member countries are adhering to the "production cut to maintain price" agreement, which is beneficial for the stability of the oil market. In November last year, OPEC set the total oil production for the first half of this year at no more than 18.5 million barrels per day.

　　欧佩克国家厉行限产
    新华社维也纳３月２０日电  据石油输出国组织（欧佩克）２０日公布的数字，欧佩克的１２个成员国２月份的石油日供应量与１月份持平，为１７４０万桶。　　
    欧佩克另一个成员国阿拉伯联合酋长国尚未公布其数字。据欧佩克秘书长苏布罗托说，这１２个国家的石油日供应量，低于去年１１月份确定的１７５１万桶的定额。
    一些石油专家认为，这表明欧佩克成员国是恪守“限产保价”协议的，它有利于石油市场的稳定。去年１１月份，欧佩克确定今年上半年其石油总产量每天不超过１８５０万桶。
