As the saying goes, "Without grain, there is no stability."

Leveraging the advantages of grain production and enhancing the momentum of agricultural development is a hot topic among the Jilin Provincial People's Congress delegates as they review Premier Li Peng's government work report.

Located in the Songliao Plain, Jilin Province is one of the key commercial grain production bases in the country. Over the past decade of reform, the province's grain production has been at the forefront in terms of development speed, commercial grain rate, per capita grain availability, and export quantities. According to statistics, over the past 10 years, the total grain production has increased by 6.3% annually. Last year alone, the province's total grain production reached 19.43 billion kilograms, with a per capita grain availability of 718 kilograms, setting a historical high. Over the past 10 years, the province has provided 55.5 billion kilograms of commercial grain, equivalent to the total amount of the previous 30 years. Since 1983, the annual commercial grain rate has exceeded 50%. Over the past 10 years, the province has exported 22.87 billion kilograms of grain for national distribution and export, which is 10 billion kilograms more than the total amount exported in the previous 30 years. Among these, corn exports have accounted for more than 50% of the national total each year.

The Jilin delegates did not become complacent about their significant contributions to the country's grain production. They discussed their views on how to strengthen the foundational role of agriculture in the national economy, particularly in developing grain production, in conjunction with the review of the government work report.

People's Congress delegate and provincial governor Wang Zhongyu said, "Premier Li Peng's government work report specifically emphasized the need to strengthen the foundational role of agriculture in the national economy, which is necessary and correct. In the case of Jilin, as long as we continue to push forward with reforms, rely on science, and increase investment, there is still great potential for grain production in Jilin. However, Jilin's grain production has both optimistic and concerning aspects because agriculture is risky and is constrained by natural conditions, social and economic conditions, and other factors. If policies are not coordinated, it will be difficult to reach a new level, and maintaining the current level will not be easy."

People's Congress delegate and vice governor in charge of agriculture Hui Liangyu said, "Jilin's agricultural situation is a mix of joy and concern. Over the past 10 years, Jilin's grain production has developed rapidly and made significant contributions to the country. However, we must also see that in the process of further developing grain production, we are facing some new problems, such as low grain prices, high production costs, low returns for farmers, heavy losses in grain operations, overly strict border trade regulations, poor production conditions, and insufficient momentum. To solve these problems, prevent a decline in grain production, and maintain a steady development momentum, we need to: first, strengthen the foundational role of agriculture in the national economy and enhance the entire society's awareness of agriculture; second, pay attention to the immediate interests of farmers, solve the problems of low grain prices and heavy farmer burdens, and respect the farmers' right to operate independently; third, increase the momentum for agricultural development, increase investment in agriculture, and adjust the grain-fertilizer linkage policy."

Delegates Zhi Zuowen and Sun Shuchang said: "As a major grain-producing area, we need to make more contributions to the country in the next few years. On one hand, cadres and the masses need to continue to work hard, and on the other hand, the country needs to pay attention to the interests of major grain-producing areas in terms of policy, and narrow the scissors difference between industrial and agricultural products."

Delegates He Zhukang, Wang Daren, and Shang Zhenling believe that the situation where the more grain is produced, the more grain is sold, and the poorer the local finances become should be changed. They suggest that the country continue to adjust relevant grain operation policies, encouraging commercial grain bases to produce and sell more grain.

　　优势与忧虑        
    ——吉林省代表团分组讨论侧记
    本报记者  段存章 王谨
    常言道：无粮不稳。
    发挥粮食生产的优势，增强农业发展后劲，是吉林省人大代表在审议李鹏总理所作的政府工作报告中的一个热门话题。
    地处松辽平原的吉林省，是全国商品粮重要基地之一。十年改革，这个省的粮食生产无论是发展速度、商品粮率、人均占有粮、外调出口量等方面均居于前列。据统计，１０年间，粮食总产量年递增６．３％，仅去年全省粮食总产达１９４．３亿公斤，人均占有粮７１８公斤，创历史最高水平。１０年提供商品粮５５５亿公斤，相当于过去３０年的总和。１９８３年以来，年平均商品率超过５０％。１０年该省用于国家外调、出口粮２２８．７亿公斤，比前３０年调出粮食总量还多１０亿公斤，其中玉米出口每年都占全国出口总量的５０％以上。
    吉林代表并没有因为在粮食生产方面对国家贡献大而沾沾自喜。他们结合审议政府工作报告，就如何加强农业在国民经济中的基础地位，特别是发展粮食生产问题，谈了各自的看法。
    人大代表、省长王忠禹说，李鹏总理的政府工作报告专门强调了加强农业在国民经济中的基础地位，是必要的、正确的。从吉林情况来说，只要继续推进改革，依靠科学，增加投入，吉林粮食生产还是大有潜力的。但是吉林粮食生产既有令人乐观的一面，也有忧虑的一面，因为农业风险大，受自然条件、社会经济条件等诸种因素制约，如果政策不配套，登上新的“台阶”难度大，确保现有水平不容易。
    人大代表、主管农业的副省长回良玉说，吉林的农业形势是喜忧并存。近１０年，吉林的粮食生产发展较快，为国家作出了贡献。但是应该看到目前在进一步发展粮食生产过程中也面临一些新问题，比如粮价过低，生产成本高，农民种粮的效益比较低，粮食经营亏损负担重，边境贸易统得过死，生产条件差、后劲不足等等。要解决这些问题，防止粮食生产“滑坡”，保持稳步发展的势头，一是切实加强农业在国民经济中的基础地位，强化全社会的农业意识；二是重视农民的切身利益，解决粮价过低、农民负担过重问题，尊重农民的经营自主权；三是增加农业发展的后劲，增加对农业资金的投入，调整粮肥挂钩政策。
    智作文、孙述昌代表说：作为粮食主产区今后几年要为国家多做贡献，一方面干部群众要继续艰苦奋斗，另一方面国家要从政策上重视粮食主产区的利益，缩小工农产品剪刀差。
    何竹康、王大任、尚振令等代表认为，产粮越多，卖粮越多，地方财政越穷的局面应该改变。建议国家继续调整好有关粮食经营政策，鼓励商品粮基地多产粮，多交粮。
