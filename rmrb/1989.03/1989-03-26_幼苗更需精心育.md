“Early childhood education cannot be neglected,” “We must not be stingy with the cause of children,” these were the appeals made by several sisters engaged in children's education and health care during several group meetings.

Hu Yamei, a deputy to the National People's Congress and the director of Beijing Children's Hospital, has dedicated over forty years to the cause of children's medical care. She excitedly said, “In 1955, the first comprehensive children's hospital in Beijing was completed and opened on Children's Day, June 1st. At that time, I was very excited and proud. As a young pediatrician and a party member, I am very grateful to the Communist Party and to Comrade Peng Zhen, who approved the establishment of the hospital. I remember in 1956, when Guo Moruo's old friend from Japan, Kawasaki Yuusen, visited China, he toured the children's hospital and exclaimed, ‘Who would have thought that shortly after the founding of New China, an Asian first-class children's hospital would be established? Japan still does not have such a comprehensive children's hospital!’”

Thirty years later, when Hu Yamei visited Japan, she saw that Japan had built several large-scale children's hospitals starting from the 1960s. She admired and respected Japan for being able to allocate so much land to build children's hospitals and for providing the best and most advanced medical equipment for children. Therefore, whenever she saw the tall buildings and luxurious hotels in Beijing, she would feel excited and indignant: “Allocate a little to improve the medical conditions for the children!”

When the children's hospital opened, it had over 30,000 square meters of building space, 600 beds, and 1,000 outpatient quotas. At that time, Beijing had only about 1 million people, with children under 15 years old accounting for 36%. This was quite good at the time. Now, rooms have been made from the original wards to establish an emergency center and equipment funded by the United Nations Children's Fund; beds have been added in the reduced wards, and the number of inpatients often exceeds 700. The situation in the outpatient department is even more unimaginable.

“But we still have great hope,” Hu Yamei said confidently. “Our newly built medical building of 14,000 square meters is said to be completed by the end of this year. Beijing Municipality has given strong support to this project.”

At the Fragrant Hills Hotel, we visited Yao Shuping, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who is engaged in early childhood education. She said frankly, “We often say that the revival of the nation starts with the children, but we often neglect early childhood education.”

Yao Shuping believes that in today's early childhood education, there is not only a lack of funds, buildings, and teachers, but also a lack of a good social environment and exemplary behavior from the elders.

At the CPPCC group discussion meeting, Wu Quanheng, vice chairman of the China Rosongling Foundation, and several other members discussed the protection and education of children. CPPCC member Lin Jiamei said that they planned to design and build an early childhood education center, and when they consulted with relevant departments to allocate a piece of land, the other party said, “We are not selling tofu, how can we cut it piece by piece.” They said that doing something for the children is so difficult. Early childhood education is about laying the foundation. Only when the seedlings are strong can they grow into tall trees. Often, the foundation education is neglected, and when they grow up, it becomes much more difficult to do ideological work.

　　幼苗更需精心育
    本报记者  晓渡
    “儿童的早期教育不能忽视”，“对儿童事业不能吝啬”，在几次小组会上，我们都听到一些从事儿童教育和保健事业的大姐们发出这样的呼吁。
    人大代表、北京儿童医院院长胡亚美，为儿童医疗事业奋斗了四十多年。她兴奋地说：“１９５５年，第一座综合性的儿童医院在北京建成，于‘六一’儿童节开诊，当时我非常激动，非常自豪。作为一名年轻的儿科医生、一名党员，我非常感谢共产党，也感谢当时批准建院的彭真同志。记得１９５６年，郭沫若同志的日本老友川崎佑宣来华访问时，参观了儿童医院，不由啧啧称赞说，‘想不到新中国建立不久，就建立了一座亚洲第一流的儿童医院，日本至今还没有这样一座综合性的儿童医院呢。’”
    ３０年后，胡亚美去日本访问时，看到日本从六十年代开始已建起了好几座规模较大的儿童医院。她对日本国能在面积不大的国土上挤出这么多地盘来建儿童医院，又把最好最先进的医疗设备给了孩子，不由感到羡慕和佩服。所以，每当她看到北京市那一座座矗立起的高楼，那一处处豪华的宾馆，她都会激动和不平：拿出一点为孩子们改善一点医疗条件吧！
    儿童医院开院时，有三万多平方米建筑，有６００个床位、１０００门诊额，当时北京只有１００多万人口，１５岁以下儿童只占３６％，这在当时来说条件就很不错了。现在，从原来的病房挤出房间，建立了急救中心和世界儿童基金会援助的仪器设备；又在减少的病房里增加了床位，经常住院的患者人数超过７００个。门诊的拥挤情况，更是难以想象。
    “不过，我们还是大有希望的。”胡亚美充满信心地说：“我们新建的一座１．４万平方米的医疗大楼，据说今年底可以交付使用了。北京市对这项工程给予了大力支持。”
    在香山饭店，我们拜访了从事幼儿教育的姚淑平委员。她开门见山地说：“我们常说民族振兴要从娃娃抓起，可是我们常常就忽视了幼儿教育。”
    姚淑平认为，在今天的幼儿教育中，不仅是缺经费、缺房子、缺教师，还缺乏良好的社会环境和长辈们的模范行为。
    在政协的小组讨论会上，政协委员、宋庆龄基金会副主席吴全衡和几位同志都谈到了儿童的保护与教育问题。政协委员林佳媚说，他们规划设计建一个儿童早期教育中心，与有关方面协商拨给一块地皮，对方竟说，“我们又不是卖豆腐的，那能一块块切”。她们说，为孩子办一点事，可难了。儿童的早期教育，是打基础。幼苗健壮，才能挺拔成材。现在往往忽视基础教育，等到长大了，再来做思想工作，就艰巨多了。
