Members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) attending the second session of the Seventh CPPCC National Committee today discussed the government work report by Premier Li Peng and the reports by Ma Yifu and Wang Zhen. They believe that the three reports, which both acknowledge achievements and discuss difficulties and mistakes, are realistic and can give people hope in times of difficulty, boosting their confidence in overcoming hardships. At the same time, the members also offered criticisms and suggestions for the government's various work.

Many members expressed their agreement with the government work report's self-criticism. Some members thought that Li Peng's summary of the government's lessons was very sincere. They believe that in such circumstances, the people will understand the country's difficulties and support the government's work. Everyone agreed that solving problems requires patience and confidence, and that constant complaints will not help; problems can only be solved one by one.

Many members believe that the hope of overcoming difficulties lies in carrying forward the fine tradition of self-reliance and thrift, and in the unity and spirit of the entire nation. Some members think that the problems we currently face are not about the number of difficulties, but about the dissatisfaction among the people caused by certain corrupt practices, and about the decline in government authority due to the failure to enforce orders and prohibitions. Overcoming difficulties first requires that all levels of leaders set an example.

　　政协委员讨论人代会三个报告        
    认为实事求是能使人们看到希望
    新华社北京３月２２日电  出席全国政协七届二次会议的委员今天分４０多个小组讨论了李鹏总理的政府工作报告和姚依林、王丙乾的报告。他们认为，这三个报告既讲了成绩，又说了困难和失误，是实事求是的，能够使人们在困难时看到希望，增强共渡难关的信心。同时，委员们对政府的各项工作也提出了批评和建议。
    许多委员在发言中对政府工作报告中的自我批评精神表示赞同。有的委员认为，李鹏总结政府工作的教训，十分诚恳。他们认为，在这种情况下，群众是会理解国家困难、支持政府工作的。大家对问题的解决要有耐心和信心，不能总是抱怨，问题只能一个个地解决。
    许多委员认为，共渡难关的希望在于发扬自力更生、勤俭建国的优良传统，在于举国上下团结一致，振奋精神，增强信心。有的委员认为，我们现在面临的问题不在于困难多少，而是由于某些腐败现象引起的群众不满意，在于有令不行、有禁不止导致的政府威信下降。共渡难关首先是各级领导干部要以身作则。
