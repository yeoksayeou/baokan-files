At the third plenary session of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, Wang Hanbin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission, explained the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law of the People's Republic of China. He said that the formulation of the Administrative Litigation Law is of great importance for implementing the Constitution and the principles proposed in the report of the Thirteenth Party Congress to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, for maintaining and promoting the lawful exercise of administrative powers by administrative organs, and for improving and enhancing administrative work.

Wang Hanbin said that China began to establish the administrative litigation system in 1982. The Civil Procedure Law (Trial) enacted in 1982 stipulates that people's courts shall accept administrative cases that can be sued according to the law. Now, more than 130 laws and administrative regulations stipulate that citizens and organizations can sue administrative cases to people's courts. The Supreme People's Court and local people's courts have successively established more than 1,400 administrative trial courts, tried many administrative cases, created conditions for the formulation of the Administrative Litigation Law, and accumulated experience.

He said that the Legislative Affairs Commission, at the request of the Standing Committee, organized relevant legal experts to research and draft the Administrative Litigation Law in 1986. Based on the Constitution, summarizing the experience of the courts in handling administrative cases over the past few years, and referring to and learning from foreign administrative litigation systems, drafts were successively drafted, including the draft draft and the draft soliciting opinions. Opinions were widely solicited from courts, procuratorates, relevant central departments, local governments, legal experts, legal colleges, and research institutions. After research and revision, the draft was submitted to the Fourth Session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee for deliberation, and it was decided to publish the full text of the draft to solicit opinions from all quarters. Based on the opinions from all sides, the Legislative Affairs Commission made many supplements and revisions to the draft.

Regarding the scope of acceptance, Wang Hanbin said that the scope of cases accepted by the courts is an important issue that the Administrative Litigation Law must first address. The draft is regulated according to the following principles: First, based on the spirit of the Constitution and the Thirteenth Party Congress, starting from safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations, appropriately expanding the scope of administrative cases currently accepted by people's courts; Second, correctly handling the relationship between judicial power and administrative power, people's courts should conduct legal trials of administrative cases, but should not interfere with the administrative acts of administrative organs within the scope of laws and regulations; should not replace administrative organs in exercising administrative power, so as to ensure that administrative organs can carry out administrative management in accordance with the law and effectively; Third, considering the current actual situation in China, administrative law is not yet perfect, the administrative trial courts of people's courts are not yet sound, the Administrative Litigation Law stipulates that "citizens can sue officials," there are issues of updating concepts, and there are also issues of bearing capacity. Therefore, the scope of acceptance should not be too wide at present, but should be gradually expanded to facilitate the implementation of the administrative litigation system.

Wang Hanbin said that the draft stipulates that citizens, legal persons, and other organizations who believe that the specific administrative acts of administrative organs and their staff infringe upon their legitimate rights and interests have the right to file a lawsuit with the people's courts in accordance with the law. The people's courts shall specifically accept the following administrative cases: (1) Those who are dissatisfied with administrative penalties such as detention, fines, revocation of permits, ordering suspension of production and operation, and confiscation of property; (2) Those who are dissatisfied with administrative compulsory measures such as restricting personal freedom or sealing up, detaining, or freezing property; (3) Those who believe that administrative organs infringe upon the legally prescribed business autonomy and lawful contractual management rights; (4) Those who believe that they meet the statutory conditions for applying for administrative organs to issue permits and licenses, but the administrative organs refuse to issue them or do not respond; (5) Those who apply for administrative organs to perform their statutory duties to protect personal and property rights, such as requesting the competent administrative organs to perform the duties of stopping the trafficking of women and stopping the looting of property, but the administrative organs refuse to perform or do not respond; (6) Those who believe that administrative organs have not issued welfare funds in accordance with the law; (7) Those who believe that administrative organs unlawfully require the performance of obligations; (8) Those who believe that administrative organs infringe upon other personal and property rights. In addition, the people's courts shall also accept other administrative cases that laws and regulations stipulate can be sued. These provisions expand the scope of cases currently accepted by the people's courts, which is necessary for further safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations.

At the same time, in order to ensure that administrative organs effectively exercise administrative powers, the draft stipulates that lawsuits filed against the following matters shall not be accepted by the people's courts: (1) National acts such as national defense and diplomacy; (2) Administrative regulations, rules, or decisions, resolutions, and orders issued by administrative organs; (3) Decisions made by administrative organs on the rewards and punishments, appointments, and dismissals of administrative personnel; (4) Specific administrative acts that are ultimately decided by law to be decided by administrative organs.

Regarding the basic principles of administrative litigation, Wang Hanbin said that the draft stipulates the following basic principles for administrative litigation: First, the people's courts shall independently exercise judicial power over administrative cases in accordance with the law, without interference from administrative organs, social organizations, or individuals. Second, the people's courts shall try administrative cases based on facts and in accordance with the law. Third, the people's courts shall review the legality of specific administrative acts when trying administrative cases. As for whether the specific administrative acts made by administrative organs within the scope of laws and regulations are appropriate, they shall generally be handled by administrative reconsideration, and the people's courts shall not make decisions in place of administrative organs. Fourth, the people's courts shall try administrative cases in accordance with the law, implementing the collegial panel system, recusal system, open trial system, and two-instance final trial system. Fifth, the parties in administrative litigation have equal legal status and have the right to debate. Sixth, the people's procuratorates have the right to supervise administrative litigation in accordance with the law.

　　在七届全国人大二次会议第三次大会上        
    王汉斌作行政诉讼法草案说明
    新华社北京３月２８日电  全国人大常委会副委员长、法制工作委员会主任王汉斌在今天上午举行的七届全国人大二次会议第三次大会上作关于中华人民共和国行政诉讼法草案的说明时说，行政诉讼法的制定，对于贯彻执行宪法和党的十三大报告提出的保障公民合法权益的原则，对于维护和促进行政机关依法行使行政职权，改进和提高行政工作，都有重要的积极的意义。
    王汉斌说，我国于１９８２年开始建立行政诉讼制度。１９８２年制定的民事诉讼法（试行）规定，人民法院受理法律规定可以起诉的行政案件。现在，已有１３０多个法律和行政法规规定了公民、组织对行政案件可以向人民法院起诉。最高人民法院和地方各级人民法院陆续建立了１４００多个行政审判庭，审理了不少行政案件，为制定行政诉讼法创造了条件，积累了经验。
    他说，法制工作委员会受委员长会议的委托，于１９８６年组织有关法律专家研究和起草行政诉讼法。根据宪法，总结几年来法院审理行政案件的经验，并参考、借鉴国外行政诉讼制度，先后拟订了草案试拟稿、草案征求意见稿，广泛征求各级人民法院、检察院、中央有关部门、各地方和法律专家、法律院系、研究单位的意见，经过研究修改，将草案提请七届全国人大常委会四次会议审议，决定将草案全文公布，广泛征求意见。根据各方面的意见，法制工作委员会对草案作了较多的补充、修改。
    关于受案范围，王汉斌说，法院受理行政案件的范围，是行政诉讼法首先要解决的重要问题。对于这个问题，草案是根据以下原则规定的：第一，根据宪法和党的十三大的精神，从保障公民、法人和其他组织的合法权益出发，适当扩大人民法院现行受理行政案件的范围；第二，正确处理审判权和行政权的关系，人民法院对行政案件应当依法进行审理，但不要对行政机关在法律、法规规定范围内的行政行为进行干预；不要代替行政机关行使行政权力，以保障行政机关依法有效地进行行政管理；第三，考虑我国目前的实际情况，行政法还不完备，人民法院行政审判庭还不够健全，行政诉讼法规定“民可以告官”，有观念更新问题，也有承受力的问题，因此对受案范围现在还不宜规定太宽，而应逐步扩大，以利于行政诉讼制度的推行。
    王汉斌说，草案规定，公民、法人和其他组织认为行政机关和行政机关工作人员的具体行政行为侵犯其合法权益的，有权依法向人民法院提起诉讼。人民法院具体受理下列行政案件：（一）对拘留、罚款、吊销许可证、责令停产停业、没收财物等行政处罚不服的；（二）对限制人身自由或者对查封、扣押、冻结财产的行政强制措施不服的；（三）认为行政机关侵犯法律规定的经营自主权和合法的承包经营权的；（四）认为符合法定条件申请行政机关颁发许可证和执照，行政机关拒绝颁发或者不予答复的；（五）申请行政机关履行保护人身权、财产权的法定职责，如请求主管行政机关履行制止拐卖妇女、制止哄抢财产等职责，行政机关拒绝履行或者不予答复的；（六）认为行政机关没有依法发给优抚金的；（七）认为行政机关违法要求履行义务的；（八）认为行政机关侵犯其他人身权、财产权的。此外，人民法院还受理法律、法规规定可以提起诉讼的其他行政案件。这些规定比人民法院现行的受案范围有所扩大，对进一步保障公民、法人和其他组织的合法权益是必要的。
    同时，为了保障行政机关有效地行使行政职权，草案规定，对下列事项提起诉讼的，人民法院不予受理：（一）国防、外交等国家行为；（二）行政法规、规章或者行政机关制定、颁布的决定、决议、命令；（三）行政机关对行政机关工作人员的奖惩、任免等决定；（四）法律规定由行政机关最终裁决的具体行政行为。
    关于行政诉讼的基本原则，王汉斌说，草案对行政诉讼的基本原则作了如下规定：第一，人民法院依法对行政案件独立行使审判权，不受行政机关、社会团体和个人的干涉。第二，人民法院审理行政案件，以事实为根据，以法律为准绳。第三，人民法院审理行政案件，是对具体行政行为是否合法进行审查，至于行政机关在法律、法规规定范围内作出的具体行政行为是否适当，原则上应由行政复议处理，人民法院不能代替行政机关作出决定。第四，人民法院审理行政案件，依法实行合议、回避、公开审判和两审终审制度。第五，当事人在行政诉讼中的法律地位平等，有权进行辩论。第六，人民检察院有权对行政诉讼实行法律监督。
