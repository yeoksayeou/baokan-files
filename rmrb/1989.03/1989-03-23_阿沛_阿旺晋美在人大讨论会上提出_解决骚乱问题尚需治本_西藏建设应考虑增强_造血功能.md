	Alphu Angjinmei, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, today at the Tibet group discussion meeting of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, pointed out that a few separatist elements created turmoil in Lhasa, causing great harm to people's lives and property. The imposition of martial law in Lhasa by the State Council is completely correct and has the support and approval of the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country. Now we need to consider addressing the root cause and fundamentally solving the problem of turmoil, so that Tibet can achieve long-term stability, prosperity, and development.

	He said, the Party Central Committee and the State Council care deeply about the Tibetan people. The central government allocates 1 billion yuan annually to Tibet. Tibet should now consider enhancing its "blood-making" function. The Tibet region is relatively special and should better implement the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, genuinely safeguard autonomy rights, respect freedom of religious belief, and protect normal religious activities.

	Alphu Angjinmei said, the Tibetan people cannot do without the support and help of their Han brothers. However, currently, a large number of migrant workers and small traders from outside the region have flooded in, with over 100,000 outsiders in Lhasa alone, causing many problems for social security. He hopes to stop this phenomenon and, at the same time, strengthen economic cooperation between Tibet and the inland regions. The inland regions can invest and also cooperate with Tibetans in joint ventures.

　　阿沛·阿旺晋美在人大讨论会上提出        
    解决骚乱问题尚需治本        
    西藏建设应考虑增强“造血功能”
    本报北京３月２２日讯  中央人民广播电台记者旺堆、本报记者高新庆报道：全国人大常委会副委员长阿沛·阿旺晋美今天在全国人大七届二次会议西藏小组讨论会上指出，少数分裂主义分子在拉萨制造骚乱，给人民的生命、财产带来很大危害，国务院在拉萨实行戒严，是完全正确的，得到藏族同胞在内的全国人民的拥护和支持。现在需考虑治本，从根本上解决骚乱问题，使西藏长治久安，繁荣昌盛。
    他说，党中央、国务院对西藏人民十分关怀，中央每年给西藏拨款１０亿元之巨。西藏现在应该考虑，增强“造血功能”。西藏地区比较特殊，更应该好好贯彻执行民族区域自治法，切实保障自治权利，尊重宗教信仰自由，保护正常的宗教活动。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美说，藏族人民离不开汉族兄弟的支持、帮助，但目前外地不少劳工、小商小贩大量流入，光拉萨外来人口就达１０多万，给社会治安带来不少麻烦。他希望制止这种现象，同时加强西藏与内地经济的合作关系，内地可以投资，也可以与西藏人搞联营。
