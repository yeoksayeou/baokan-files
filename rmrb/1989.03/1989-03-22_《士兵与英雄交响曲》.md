Young poet Wang Jinjun's new poetry collection, "Soldiers and Heroes Symphony," has recently been published by the People's Liberation Army Press. This is his second work following "Pastoral Symphony."

The poet, with his ardent and sincere love for the motherland and the people, portrays the lofty ideals, noble sentiments, and selfless dedication of contemporary Chinese soldiers. He extends the reach of his poetic brush to the iron-clad frontiers, green military camps, the vast expanse of the country, and the long river of history. Reflecting on history and cherishing the mountains and rivers of the motherland, he pours out his heartfelt emotions and the spirit of the times. It is a grand and heroic symphony of soldiers and heroes.
