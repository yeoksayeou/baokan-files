From January 3 to 12, Ma Dongming and Liu Dongxu from the Liaoning Liao Yang City Yilao Industrial Company (hereinafter referred to as Yilao Company) visited our newspaper to report that the Jiangxi Jiujiang City Light Industry Building Materials Company (hereinafter referred to as Building Materials Company) sold inferior BME fluorescent brighteners, causing Yilao Company to suffer significant economic losses.

The visitors said that in July 1987, Li Guangsheng, the sales director of Yilao Company, and others went to the Jiangxi Jiujiang Building Materials Company to purchase 30 tons of chromic anhydride at a price of 17,400 yuan per ton. On July 30, Yilao Company remitted 522,000 yuan to the account of the Building Materials Company. Soon after, the chemical director of the Building Materials Company informed them that the purchase of chromic anhydride required the inclusion of BME fluorescent brighteners, priced at 30,500 yuan per ton, and stated that chromic anhydride was temporarily out of stock. Li Guangsheng promptly sought instructions from Yilao Company on whether to purchase this batch of goods. The company replied that they did not want it and requested the funds to be returned. Upon learning of this, the leaders of the Building Materials Company told the Yilao Company's staff that the funds had already been remitted to the Guangzhou Haizhu Chemical Raw Materials Company (hereinafter referred to as Chemical Raw Materials Company), and it would take two months to refund the money. They also said that the Chemical Raw Materials Company's goods were imported from Japan and had good quality, with all relevant documents available. Under the enthusiastic hospitality of the Building Materials Company, Li Guangsheng and others signed a contract to purchase 20 tons of BME fluorescent brighteners.

In August 1987, the Guangzhou Chemical Raw Materials Company shipped 20 tons of BME fluorescent brighteners without a manufacturer, production date, or batch number to Liao Yang City. Later, Yilao Company repeatedly requested the Building Materials Company for product certificates, quality assurance certificates, customs inspection certificates, and relevant technical documents. The company provided only a usage manual, and the other documents have not been provided to this day. To verify the authenticity, Yilao Company conducted multiple trials at the Liao Yang Printing and Dyeing Factory, Paper Factory, and Knitting Factory. The results of multiple trials proved that the quality of this batch of "BME fluorescent brighteners" was unqualified. Yilao Company also commissioned the Shenyang Chemical Research Institute of the Chemical Industry Department to test the product. The test results showed that the main performance indicator, whitening strength, of this batch of products was only 9.4 points, which did not reach 1/10 of the performance of domestic VBL fluorescent brighteners, while the price per ton was more than 10,000 yuan higher than that of domestic VBL. The test results also proved that this batch of "BME fluorescent brighteners" had uneven particles and contained a large amount of alum (the price of alum at that time was 320 yuan per ton). Afterwards, Yilao Company repeatedly requested the Building Materials Company to return the goods, but there has been no result so far.

The visitors requested that relevant departments pay attention to the issue of pushing and selling inferior and counterfeit brighteners and hoped that the newspaper would expose it to prevent more people from being deceived, thereby safeguarding the interests of the state and the people.

### 经销伪劣萤光增白剂谁来管

专栏：来访纪要

　　经销伪劣萤光增白剂谁来管
    １月３日至１２日，辽宁辽阳市益劳工业实业公司（以下简称益劳公司）马东明、刘东旭先后几次到本报上访，反映江西九江市轻化建材公司（以下简称建材公司）销售劣质ＢＭＥ萤光增白剂，使益劳公司蒙受重大经济损失的问题。
    来访者说，１９８７年７月，益劳公司销售科长李广生等人前往江西九江建材公司购买３０吨铬酸酐，定价每吨１７４００元。当月３０日，益劳公司将５２．２万元汇入建材公司帐号。不久，建材公司化工科长出面说，购铬酸酐需搭ＢＭＥ萤光增白剂，每吨３０５００元，并说铬酸酐暂时无货。李广生及时向益劳公司请示是否要这批货，公司答复不要，将款汇回。建材公司领导得知这个消息后告诉益劳公司的经办人，这笔款已汇到广州海珠化原公司（以下简称化原公司），退款得两个月时间，还说化原公司这批货是从日本进口的，质量不错，各种资料都有。在建材公司的热情招待下，李广生等人和他们签订了一份订购２０吨ＢＭＥ萤光增白剂的协议书。
    １９８７年８月，广州化原公司将２０吨没有生产厂家，没有出厂日期和批号的“ＢＭＥ萤光增白剂”发到辽阳市。后来，益劳公司多次向建材公司催要产品合格证、质量保证书、海关检验证和有关技术资料，这家公司除给了一份使用说明书外，其它资料至今没有提供。为弄清真伪，益劳公司先后到辽阳市印染厂、造纸厂、针织厂进行使用试验，多次试验结果证明，这批“ＢＭＥ萤光增白剂”的质量不合格。益劳公司又委托化工部沈阳化工研究院测试，测试后认定，这批产品的主要效能指标增白强度只有９．４分，达不到国产ＶＢＬ萤光增白剂效能的１／１０，而每吨价格却比国产ＶＢＬ高出１万多元。测试结果还证明，这批“ＢＭＥ萤光增白剂”颗粒不均匀，掺有大量元明粉（当时１吨议价元明粉３２０元）。事后，益劳公司多次向建材公司要求退货，但一直没有结果。
    来访人要求有关部门重视这一推销劣质假冒增白剂的问题，并希望报纸披露，以避免更多的人上当受骗，维护国家和人民的利益。
