	Wan Li hopes the NPC session will be a spirit-boosting, confidence-enhancing conference
	Promote democracy; discuss both problems and progress
	Summarize experiences; offer ideas for rectification and reform

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 19—At the preparatory meeting for the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress held this morning, Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, expressed the hope that this conference would fully promote democracy, speak freely, discuss both the current problems and the progress made in reform and construction, analyze the situation truthfully, summarize experiences, and offer ideas and solutions for the rectification and deepening of reform.

	He said, this conference is convened at a crucial moment when the country is implementing the policy of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening reform comprehensively. All representatives and the broad masses of cadres and people are concerned about the progress of rectification and reform, and they all care about the convening of this conference. It is the common wish and responsibility of all representatives to hold a successful conference.

	Wan Li said, our country's reform has achieved internationally recognized success, but there are also many difficulties and problems in the process of advancement. Since the implementation of the rectification and reform policy, initial results have been achieved. To complete the arduous task of rectification and deepening reform, we must have a stable environment. Without a stable environment, nothing can be accomplished, and the achievements of reform will be lost. As long as the people of the entire country unite as one, with a common mind and common will, we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and continue to push forward the cause of reform and construction.

	Wan Li pointed out that the representatives have close ties with the broad masses of the people, especially the representatives from the front lines of reform and construction, who have a deeper understanding of the people's thoughts on reform and have personal experiences with rectification and reform. He hopes that through the joint efforts of all representatives, this conference will definitely be a spirit-boosting, confidence-enhancing conference, a conference that promotes rectification and deepens reform, and achieves new victories in reform and construction.

　　万里希望人代会开成振奋精神增强信心大会
    发扬民主　问题和进展都要讲
    总结经验　为治理整顿出主意
    新华社北京３月１９日电  全国人大常委会委员长万里在今天上午举行的七届全国人大二次会议预备会议上希望：这次大会要充分发扬民主，畅所欲言，既讲当前存在的问题，又讲改革和建设工作中取得的进展，实事求是地分析形势，总结经验，为搞好治理整顿、深化改革出主意，想办法。
    他说，这次大会是在举国上下贯彻执行治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的关键时刻召开的。各位代表和广大干部群众普遍关心治理整顿的进展情况，对这次大会的召开都很关心。开好这次大会是我们全体代表的共同愿望和责任。
    万里说，我国的改革取得了举世公认的成就，在前进中也存在着不少困难和问题。贯彻治理整顿方针以来，已经取得了初步成效。要完成治理整顿、深化改革的艰巨任务，必须有一个稳定的环境。没有稳定的环境，什么也搞不成，改革已经取得的成果也会丧失。全国人民团结一致，同心同德，就一定能克服困难，把改革和建设事业继续推向前进。
    万里指出，代表们同广大人民群众有着密切的联系，特别是来自改革和建设第一线的代表，更加了解人民群众对改革的想法，对治理整顿有着切身的体会。他希望通过全体代表的共同努力，一定会把会议开成一个振奋精神，增强信心的大会，开成一个推动治理整顿、深化改革的大会，夺取改革和建设的新胜利。
