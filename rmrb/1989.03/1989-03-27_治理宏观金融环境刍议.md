Currently, China's macroeconomic financial environment faces three major issues: insufficient funds coexist with excessive money supply, rapid and irrational credit expansion, and persistent inflation with rising prices and irrational price ratios. The immediate tasks for managing the macroeconomic financial environment are to curb inflation, tighten money supply, adjust credit structure, and accelerate the circulation of money. To achieve this, we must deepen financial system reforms.

Strengthen the centralization of the central bank. The authority to determine money supply and credit quotas should be centralized under the State Council and the central bank. Gradually change the local nature of the central bank's institutions and the decentralized nature of money supply.

Establish sensitive and rapid communication channels.

To manage the macroeconomic financial environment and curb inflation, the authority to determine money supply and credit quotas should be centralized under the State Council and the central bank. Money, due to its liquidity, acts as the "circulation wheel" of commodities. Money circulation is highly centralized with almost no spatial limitations. Therefore, the central bank's system should be highly centralized. The central bank's primary task is to formulate a unified monetary policy. The macroeconomic goals of monetary policy mainly include a sustainable growth rate within the national economy's capacity, reasonable growth of consumption funds, balanced international payments, and stable prices. In serving these economic goals, finance primarily relies on the leverage of money. In times of economic overheating, tighten money supply; in times of economic recession, loosen money supply. During tightening, avoid blanket measures; during loosening, avoid loss of control, fully utilizing money's role as the primary driving force, sustained driving force, and stabilizer.

To implement a unified monetary policy, gradually change the local nature of the central bank's institutions and the decentralized nature of money supply. The central bank's money issuance and credit supply must serve the central government's macroeconomic goals, with no regions having the authority to modify them. Given China's vast territory and uneven economic development, as the commodity economy develops, several economic regions will form. The central bank's branches should gradually be established according to economic regions, with a few border areas still establishing branches based on administrative regions (such as Tibet, Hainan, and special economic zones). Only in this way can we gradually overcome the phenomenon of "mandatory loans" and "project approvals" at the local level. Some provinces and cities have implemented credit fund contracting, which has played a certain role in mobilizing local enthusiasm for finance. However, with the development of the commodity economy and the national financial market, regional credit contracting may bring some negative effects.

Strengthening the centralization of the central bank requires sensitive and rapid communication channels. We should accelerate the construction of financial electronic computer communication networks, enabling banks to timely grasp economic and financial information and speed up fund transfers. The central bank's information and fund settlement network is the backbone network of the financial electronic transmission network, serving as the final and immediate payment network for inter-bank fund settlements. Through the central bank's backbone network, we can accelerate fund turnover and promote the spread of electronic money such as credit cards, automatic settlements, and direct wage deposits into savings accounts.

Gradually transition to indirect regulation as the primary method, while conducting necessary direct regulation, combining necessary state intervention with financial legislation.

In managing the macroeconomic financial environment, we must gradually transition to indirect regulation as the primary method while conducting necessary direct regulation. Indirect regulation primarily involves adjusting interest rates, exchange rates, insurance premiums, bank corporatization, and competition among banks based on improved services. During the phase of management and rectification, various financial price adjustment models mainly allow for a certain range of fluctuations based on state-regulated basic prices. We must adjust prices according to supply and demand while adhering to policies of stability, savings, efficiency, and adjusting the industrial loan structure. Before the central bank has appropriate open market operations, controlling money supply primarily relies on credit quotas and cash management.

During the phase of management and rectification, we must emphasize combining necessary state intervention with financial legislation. This includes:

1. Functional intervention: Different types of financial institutions should adhere to their approved business scopes. Strict control should be exercised over investment institutions, foreign exchange-operating institutions, and newly established institutions.
2. Risk intervention: Regulations should be established for the maximum ratio of bank loans to deposits and the maximum ratio of loans to self-capital. Strict control should be exercised over loans to enterprises with third and fourth-class credit ratings.
3. Credit policy intervention: Emphasize the supervisory role of banks. Speculative activities, hoarding, price gouging, wasteful spending, unapproved construction projects, group purchases, violations of cash management regulations, and all activities exploiting the differences between the two systems for excessive profits, as well as false asset reporting, fictitious profits, tax evasion, and other behaviors, should all be subject to credit sanctions. Credit should be adjusted according to the state's industrial policy to optimize the industrial structure of loans and according to the credit rating of enterprises to optimize the efficiency structure of loans.
4. Credit inspection: The State Council and the central bank should establish regular or irregular credit inspection systems.
5. Enact banking laws and relevant laws or regulations on mergers, shareholding, interest rates, credit contracts, and cash management.

Combine long-term financial goals with effective short-term arrangements, monitoring monthly and quarterly changes in the money situation, and setting near-term, long-term, and seasonal alert lines.

During the phase of management and rectification, we must formulate long-term financial goal plans and effective short-term arrangements. We must prevent short-term behavior and neglect of process management. Money circulation, apart from seasonal fluctuations, is continuous. Moreover, the time lag from the issuance of a monetary policy to its effect is generally more than six months. Therefore, financial institutions should have long-term financial plans, especially the central bank should formulate long-term macro monetary policies based on the national economic plan. The plan should predict long-term money supply (including M, M1, M2, etc., different monetary aggregates) and money circulation speed, as well as credit industrial structure and efficiency structure goals. At the same time, it should set targets for residents' currency income savings rate, direct and indirect financial fund scale, interest rates, exchange rates, insurance premiums, various fund sources, and the proportion of various loans for basic construction, working capital, technological transformation, etc., guiding enterprises to develop internally and the national economy to modernize, intensify, and become highly efficient. Regarding the mid-term plan during the phase of management and rectification, various measures should be formulated to curb inflation and stabilize prices, creating a new financial situation that is stable, orderly, information-sensitive, and effective in leveraging economic policies.

As the commodity economy develops, more people will enter banks, and banks will enter all aspects of life, making the impact of prediction and psychological factors on money more significant. The central bank should monitor the ever-changing money situation monthly and quarterly and take timely measures. The central bank and various specialized banks should closely monitor the development of the money situation, establishing their own money monitoring targets, including wholesale price index, retail price index, bank deposits, urban and rural savings, construction investment, consumption funds, commercial inventories, factory finished products and reserve funds, credit quotas, settlement funds, money issuance, M1, M2, and other broad money changes, foreign trade imports and exports, interest rates, exchange rates, national debt, fiscal revenue and expenditure, and a series of target changes. These changes are money signals, and near-term, long-term, and seasonal alert lines should be set.

Manage and rectify various channels for transmitting monetary policy, manage and rectify the credit network, and rectify and cultivate the financial market.

In managing the macroeconomic financial environment, we must manage and rectify various channels for transmitting monetary policy. In developed capitalist economies, monetary policy transmission occurs through credit effects, securities effects, and wealth effects (changes in financial assets and real assets that bring income to holders). Currently, China's financial markets are mostly in their infancy. The main channel for transmitting monetary policy remains the credit channel. This means that China's finance is still primarily indirect finance mediated by banks, with direct finance in financial market transactions being negligible. Therefore, China's inflation is often caused by credit control failures. Credit is the main channel for cash issuance and broad money issuance. Controlling the total credit amount, adjusting the credit structure, and strengthening cash management are the main valves for curbing inflation. The bank institutions and customer deposit-loan relationships and contracts distributed across the country form a crisscrossing credit network. If money is the lifeline of the commodity economy, the financial and banking system is the heart of the commodity economy, then the credit network is the nervous system of economic transactions.

Through credit inspections, we should manage and rectify China's credit network into an effective, clean, and fully functional credit network. This network should have service functions, accounting functions, policy functions, and supervisory functions. Credit personnel and bank counter staff, especially bank leaders, should implement monetary policy, adhere to credit policy, and practice clean credit, avoiding personal favoritism and accepting any form of kickbacks or bribes. In the primary stage of socialism, insufficient funds are a long-term phenomenon. Banks should strive to attract and stabilize more savings and deposits while ensuring that every yuan of credit (the bank's "product") is used in the most needed industries and enterprises, making every loan comply with credit policy and generate high efficiency.

While managing and rectifying the credit network, we should also rectify and cultivate the already established financial market. We should make the financial market a market with financial instruments, organizational order, rules and regulations, timely information, reasonable prices, and suppression of speculation. The prosperity of the financial market depends on the availability of increasingly rich financial instruments (financial commodities). The development of the financial market should be combined with the securitization (instrumentalization) of credit. The financial market should guide savings and investments to diversify (in addition to savings books, there are also savings certificates, stocks, bonds, and various value-preserving savings and investment financial instruments), guide consumption to diversify (such as housing commodification, scientific and cultural activities, and various labor services), guide personal and property insurance, and guide fund settlement to speed up (such as through commercial bills, electronic transmission, automatic settlement, credit cards, etc.). These are the channels for the diversification of residents' currency income repatriation, not just through commodity consumption.

In the initial stage of building and cultivating the financial market, the focus is not on the quantity of the market but on improving the quality of the market. If each economic region has a high-efficiency, standardized central financial market, it can drive the trading of financial instruments within the economic region. Currently, we should concentrate manpower and material resources to strengthen the construction of central markets and summarize market management experience. To ensure the safety of investors' funds, facilitate management, and stabilize prices, we should fully utilize the role of a few central markets in the country. Because financial transactions tend to concentrate, such as the world's financial transactions mainly concentrated in New York, London, Tokyo, and Hong Kong, we should study the experience of various countries in establishing financial markets.

To leverage the regulatory role of the financial market and move towards "state regulation of the market, market guidance of enterprises," the People's Bank of China should also establish its own "open market operations," directly controlling a financial instrument, and regularly or irregularly buying and selling in the market to adjust bank reserves. Through the use of the policy tool of "open market operations," adjusting money supply and interest rates will help the central bank gradually learn to use economic means to regulate the market, prevent and curb inflation.

Strive for balanced international payments and stable exchange rates, with the most important being the control of import and export rights and foreign borrowing rights.

Balanced international payments are an important issue in the macroeconomic financial environment. In international payments, we face the sharp problem of insufficient foreign exchange. For China, foreign exchange is equivalent to science and technology. To achieve the modernization of the national economy, we must introduce advanced foreign science and technology, which requires sufficient foreign exchange. This is one aspect. On the other hand, our use of foreign exchange to introduce technology is limited. It is first determined by the competitiveness of our exported commodities and services in the international market and the quantity of commodities that can be exported while meeting domestic demand. Of course, when foreign exchange is insufficient, we can introduce foreign capital, but introducing foreign capital requires repayment, and before repayment, interest must be paid annually. This requires considering the country's repayment and interest-paying capacity. Even with repayment and interest-paying capacity, we must also consider the stability of the exchange rate. Foreign exchange is a financial commodity, and the exchange rate is the price of foreign exchange. Prices are determined by the law of supply and demand. In the case of excessive foreign exchange demand and insufficient earning (current account deficit), the renminbi will depreciate, exacerbating inflation. Therefore, striving for balanced international payments and stable exchange rates should be an important part of managing the financial environment.

To strive for balanced international payments and stable exchange rates, a lot of work needs to be done. The most important is to control import and export rights and foreign borrowing rights. Limited raw materials for export commodities should first be used by commodities with international market competitiveness, avoiding mutual price hikes and increased export earning costs. Limited foreign exchange should first be used to introduce domestically applicable advanced equipment and software technology and other necessary commodities. Commodities that can be domestically manufactured with qualified quality and price should not be introduced again or introduced in the name of importing components for assembly. At the same time, strengthen foreign debt management work, and borrowing foreign debt must go through approval procedures. These should have corresponding legislation. Under the unified foreign trade and foreign debt laws and regulations, promote competition in improving the quality of exported commodities, reducing earning costs; promote the development of new earning commodities and services; promote the development of true "three-in-one" businesses; while the foreign trade department is the judge of the quality of exported commodities (through agency business). Of course, the judgment results should have standards, scores, and feedback, changing the past method of "cooking good and bad together" to truly implement the principle of survival of the fittest. From the decentralization of foreign rights to the appropriate concentration of organized, led, and "judged" competition, this is also a deepening of the reform.

　　治理宏观金融环境刍议
    目前，我国宏观金融环境存在三个问题，资金不足和货币供应偏多并存。信贷额度高速增加和结构不合理，通货膨胀和物价螺旋上升比价仍不合理。当前治理宏观金融环境的任务是，抑制通货膨胀，紧缩货币供应量，调整信贷结构，加快货币流通速度。为此，要深化金融体制改革。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    加强中央银行的集中性。把货币供应量和信贷额度决定权集中于国务院和中央银行。逐步改变中央银行机构的地方性和货币供应的分散性。
    　　建立灵敏迅速的通信手段。
    治理宏观金融环境，抑制通货膨胀，应把货币供应量和信贷额度决定权集中于国务院和中央银行。因为货币的特性是流动，是商品的“流通车轮”。货币流通具有高度集中性，几乎没有空间的限制。所以，中央银行的体制应当是高度集中的。中央银行的主要任务是制订统一的货币政策。货币政策的宏观经济目标主要是，国民经济的可承受的以内涵为主的增长速度，消费基金的合理增长，国际收支平衡和物价稳定。金融在为这些经济目标服务中，主要靠货币的杠杆作用。在经济过热时紧缩货币供应，在经济衰退时放松货币供应。紧缩时不一刀切，放松时不失控，充分发挥货币的第一推动力、持续推动力和稳定器的作用。
    为了实行统一的货币政策，应逐步改变中央银行机构的地方性和货币供应的分散性。中央银行的货币投放和信贷供应，只能服从中央政府的宏观经济目标，各地区无权修改。我国地区辽阔、经济发展不平衡，随着商品经济的发展，将形成若干经济区域。中央银行的分支机构应逐步按照经济区域设立，少数边疆地区可以仍然按照行政区域设立分行（如西藏、海南、经济特区等）。只有这样才可以逐步克服地方上的“奉命贷款”、“批条工程”现象。某些省市实行信贷资金承包办法，的确起过一定的作用，调动了地方关心金融的积极性，但是，随着商品经济的发展和全国性金融市场之间的联系，地区性信贷承包可能会带来某些消极现象。
    加强中央银行的集中性，需要有灵敏迅速的通信手段。应加快金融电子计算机通信网络建设的步伐，使银行及时掌握经济和金融信息，加快资金传输。中央银行的信息和资金清算网络，是金融电子传输网络中的主干网络，它是银行之间资金清算的最后的立即的支付网络。通过中央银行的主干网络，可以加快资金周转速度，加快信用卡、自动清算、工资直接存入储蓄户等电子货币的推广。
    　　　　逐步走向以间接调节为主，同时进行必要的直接调节，把必要的国家干预与金融立法结合起来。
    在治理宏观金融环境中，既要逐步走向以间接调节为主，又要进行必要的直接调节。间接调节主要从利率、汇率和保险费率、银行企业化和银行间以改进服务为基础的竞争等方面进行调节。在治理、整顿为主的阶段，各种金融价格的调节模式，主要是在国家规定基本价格的基础上允许一定的上下浮动比例。既要根据供求情况进行价格变动，又要坚持稳定为主、多存为主、效益为主和调整产业贷款结构为主的政策。在中央银行还没有适当的公开市场作业的金融工具前，货币供应量的控制，主要靠信贷额度和现金管理。
    在治理和整顿期间，应更加重视把必要的国家干预和金融立法结合起来。其中包括：一、功能干预。不同类型的金融机构应遵守批准的经营范围。对于投资性机构、经营外汇的机构、新开业的机构，应严格控制。二、风险干预。应规定银行贷款占存款的最高比例，贷款不应超过自有资本的最高比例。对接受贷款的企业应评定信用等级，严格控制三、四类信用等级的贷款额度。三、信贷政策干预。应强调银行的信贷监督作用。对于投机倒把、囤积居奇、抬价抢购、铺张浪费、未经批准的基本建设和集团购买、违犯现金管理条例，以及一切利用两种体制的差别牟取暴利的行为，以及资产不实、虚盈实亏、逃避纳税等行为，都应进行信贷制裁。信贷应按照国家的产业政策，调整信贷的产业结构，按照企业的信用等级，调整信贷的效益结构。四、信贷检查。国务院和中央银行应建立定期或不定期信贷检查制度。五、颁布银行法以及有关兼并、持股、利率、信贷合同、现金管理等专门法令或规章。
    　　　　较长期的金融目标规划与有效的短期安排相结合，按月按季监测货币变化的形势，规定近期、远期和季节的警界线。
    在治理和整顿期间，应制定较长时期的金融目标规划，并进行有效的短期安排。既要防止短期行为，又要防止忽视过程管理的现象。货币流通除了有季节性波动以外，总是川流不息的。加之，一项货币政策从颁发到发生作用的时差，一般在６个月以上。所以，金融机构应有长期的金融规划，特别是中央银行应根据国家的经济规划，制定长期的宏观货币政策。规划应按照经济目标预测长期的货币供应量（包括Ｍ、Ｍ１、Ｍ２……不同货币总量），以及货币流动速度和信贷产业结构与效益结构等目标。同时，还应规定，居民货币收入储蓄率目标，直接金融和间接金融资金规模目标，利率、汇率、保险费率目标，各种资金来源和基本建设、流动资金、技术改造等各种贷款比例的目标，引导企业走内涵发展的道路，引导国民经济走现代化、集约化、高效化的道路。关于治理和整顿期间的中期规划，应制定抑制通货膨胀、稳定物价的各种措施，通过治理整顿创造一个稳定的、有秩序的、信息灵敏、发挥经济杠杆作用的新的金融局面。
    商品经济越发展，越形成“人人进入银行、银行进入事事”的局面，预测和心理因素对货币的影响越显著。中央银行应按月按季地监测货币千变万化的形势，及时采取措施。中央银行和各类专业银行都应密切注视货币形势的发展，建立各自的货币监测目标，包括批发物价指数、零售物价指数、银行存款、城乡储蓄、基建投资、消费基金、商业存货、工厂产成品和储备资金、信贷额度、结算资金、货币发行、Ｍ１Ｍ２等广义货币变化、外贸进出口、利率、汇率、国债、财政收支等一系列目标的变化。这些变化是货币信号，应规定近期、远期和季节的警界线。
    　　　　治理整顿各种货币政策的传递渠道，治理整顿信贷网络，整顿和培育金融市场。
    在治理宏观金融环境中，应治理和整顿各种货币政策的传递渠道。在资本主义经济发达国家，货币政策的传递通过信贷效果、证券效果和财富效果（为持有者带来收入的金融资产和实物资产的变化）。目前我国的金融市场大多还处于原始阶段。货币政策传递的主渠道仍然是信贷渠道。这就是说，我国的金融目前还是以银行为媒介的间接金融，在金融市场交易的直接金融还微不足道。因此，我国的通货膨胀，多是通过信贷失控燃起的。信贷是现金投放和广义货币投放的主渠道。控制信贷总额，调整信贷结构，加强现金管理是抑制通货膨胀的总闸门。分布在全国各地的银行机构和顾客的存贷款关系和契约，构成为纵横交错的信贷网络。如果说货币是商品经济的生命线，金融和银行系统是商品经济的心脏，那末，信贷网络就是经济交易的神经系统。
    通过信贷检查，应把我国的信贷网络治理和整顿成为一个有效的、廉洁的、功能齐全的信贷网络。这个网络应具有服务功能、核算功能、政策功能、监督功能。信贷人员和银行柜台人员，首先是银行领导，应贯彻货币政策，遵守信贷政策，坚持廉洁信贷，不搞人情贷款，不收取任何形式的回扣或贿赂。在社会主义初级阶段，资金不足是长期现象。银行要争取和稳固更多的储蓄和存款，同时要力争把每一元信贷（这是银行的“产品”）都用在最需要的产业和企业，使每笔贷款都符合信贷政策，产生高效益。
    在治理和整顿信贷网络的同时，还应整顿和培育已经建立的金融市场。要使金融市场成为有金融工具，有组织秩序，有规章法律，信息灵通，价格合理，抑制投机的金融市场。金融市场是否繁荣，决定于是否有日益丰富的金融工具（金融商品）。金融市场的发展应和信贷证券化（工具化）相结合。金融市场应引导储蓄和投资多元化（除存折以外，还有存单、股票、债券和各种保值的存款和投资金融工具），引导消费多样化（如住房商品化、科学文化活动和各种劳务服务等），引导人身和财产保险化，并引导资金结算快速化（如通过商业票据、电子传输、自动清算、信用卡等）。这些就是居民货币收入的回笼渠道多元化，而不只是通过商品消费一条渠道。
    在建设和培育金融市场的初期，重点不是市场的数量，而是提高市场的质量。如果每一个经济区有一个高效率的规范化的中心金融市场，就可以把经济区内的金融工具交易带动起来。目前应集中人力、物力加强中心市场建设，借以总结市场管理经验。为了确保投资者的资金安全，易于管理，平抑价格，应充分发挥全国为数不多的若干中心市场的作用。因为金融交易是趋向于集中的，如世界金融交易主要集中于纽约、伦敦、东京、香港等中心市场。我们应研究各国建立金融市场的经验。
    为了发挥金融市场的调节作用，走向“国家调节市场，市场引导企业”的方向，我国中央银行也应建立自己的“公开市场业务”，直接掌握一种金融工具，定期或不定期在市场出售和购买，以调节银行储备量。通过利用“公开市场业务”这种政策工具，调节货币供应和利率，有助于中央银行逐步学会用经济手段调节市场，预防和抑制通货膨胀。
    　　　　力争国际收支平衡和汇率稳定，最重要的是控制进出口权和借外债权。
    国际收支平衡是宏观金融环境的重要问题。在国际收支中，我们面临着外汇不足这个尖锐的问题。对我国来说，外汇就是科学技术。为了实现国民经济现代化，我们必须引进国外先进的科学技术，而引进科学技术需要足够的外汇。这是一方面。另一方面，我们引进技术用汇是有一定限度的。首先决定于我们出口的商品和劳务在国际市场的竞争能力，以及在首先满足国内需求的原则下商品可能出口的数量。当然，外汇不足时，可以引进外资，但是，引进外资是要偿还的，未偿还前每年还要付息。这就要考虑国家偿债和付息能力。即使有偿债付息能力，也要考虑汇率的稳定。外汇是一种金融商品，汇率是外汇的价格。而价格是由供求规律决定的，在外汇需求过大而创汇不足（经常项目赤字）的情况下，人民币就会贬值，并助长通货膨胀。所以，力争国际收支平衡和稳定汇率，应是治理金融环境的重要内容之一。
    为力争国际收支平衡和稳定汇率，需要做的工作很多。其中最重要的是控制进出口权和借外债权。有限的出口商品的原材料，应首先由在国际市场有竞争能力的出口商品使用，不能相互抬价争购，增加商品的出口创汇成本。有限的外汇，应首先用于引进国内适用的先进设备和软件技术和其他必须引进的商品，凡是国内能制造的、质量价格合格的商品，不应再引进或以引进零部件为名，引进散件组装。同时，加强外债管理工作，借用外债必须经过批准手续。这些都应有相应的立法。在统一外贸和外债法令下，提倡在提高出口商品质量，降低创汇成本方面竞争；提倡开辟新的创汇商品和劳务；提倡开展真正“两头在外”的“三来一补”业务；而外贸部门则是出口商品优劣的裁判者（通过代理业务）。当然，裁判结果应该有标准、有评分、有回音，改变过去那种“好坏一锅煮”的办法，真正实行优胜劣汰。从下放对外权以后的盲目竞争，到适当集中下的有组织、有领导、有“裁判结果”的竞争，也是改革的深化。
