Beijing Bai Kongque Garment Factory and the government of Qijiazhuang Township, Mentougou District, today signed a rehabilitation and placement agreement with the kitchen brigade of the Beijing First Prison Sock Factory. The agreement stipulates that prisoners who meet the specified requirements will be placed in jobs upon completion of their sentences.

The agreement specifies that the two rehabilitation units will maintain regular contact with the Beijing First Prison Sock Factory, jointly conduct educational activities for the prisoners, and work with the labor reform unit to provide targeted training for the prisoners during their incarceration. This will enable them to adapt to the work requirements of the rehabilitation and placement units upon completion of their sentences. A relevant official from the Beijing Labor Reform Bureau stated that since 1987, the Beijing Labor Reform Bureau has signed labor reform rehabilitation and placement agreements with 18 districts and counties under the city's jurisdiction.

    新华社北京3月2日电  （记者胡清海、实习生张春）北京白孔雀服装厂和门头沟区齐家庄乡政府今天与北京市第一监狱袜厂伙房中队签订帮教安置协议，决定对达到协议规定要求的服刑人员在刑满时予以安置。
    协议规定，这两个帮教单位将与北京市监狱袜厂保持经常性的联系，协同对服刑人员进行教育活动，并与劳改单位一起对犯人在服刑期间进行定向培养，使他们刑满后适应帮教安置单位工作需要。北京市劳改局有关负责人说，1987年以来，北京市劳改局与市属18个区县签订了劳改帮教安置协议。
