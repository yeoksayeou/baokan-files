The China Diving Open will be held in Guangzhou in April. The China Lenovo Diving Team, consisting of athletes such as Xiong Ni and Chen Xiaodan, and the China Diving Team, consisting of athletes like Xu Yanmei and Gao Min, will both participate in this event. It is reported that top diving athletes from the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada, and other countries will also compete in this high-level event following the Olympics.

The China Diving Open was held in Jinan last April. This competition has become a high-standard traditional international event held in China. Chinese divers won two gold medals at the Olympics, with Xiong Ni and Chen Xiaodan's outstanding performances shocking the world diving community. Foreign media have declared the beginning of the "Xiong Ni era" in men's diving, while Chen Xiaodan is considered the most likely contender to challenge Xu Yanmei.

With the support of the Computer Science Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the China Diving Team is fully utilizing modern scientific technology to study the optimal diving training simulation, aiming to solve the current difficulties in China's diving training.

According to Mei Zhenyao, a member of the International Swimming Federation Executive Committee and a leader of the Chinese Swimming Association, the Computer Science Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences will continue to support the China Diving Team in 1989 and 1990. The team, including Xiong Ni, will participate in competitions under the name of the China Lenovo Diving Team. He described this as a combination of high-tech and top-level sports.
