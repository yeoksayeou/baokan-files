		The Ministry of Justice has recently issued regulations on prisoner performances, restricting the scope and content of such activities. It emphasizes that cultural activities in labor reform units should serve the purpose of reform, aiming to eliminate disorderly practices.

		In recent years, many labor reform units have actively explored new approaches to reform work, organizing prisoners to participate in various artistic performances, which have yielded good social effects. However, some disorderly practices have emerged, such as some units engaging in commercial performances, allowing prisoners to perform in public for extended periods. In selecting performers, some units focus solely on performance skills, neglecting reform performance and potential social reactions. These practices have had negative impacts on society. To rectify these issues, the Ministry of Justice has issued the following regulations:

		Prisoner performances should primarily take place within the labor reform facilities. If the performance level is high, organized report performances can be conducted with specific goals and plans. The primary audience should be relevant departments, units involved in rehabilitation assistance, and the prisoners' families. The purpose is to enhance societal understanding and support for the reform of criminals. Commercial performances are strictly prohibited. The content of the performances should mainly consist of original works, encouraging prisoners to create and perform pieces that propagate the policies and guidelines of labor reform, reflecting reform life and achievements. Prisoners participating in performances must have shown good reform behavior and acknowledged their crimes. During report performances, the performance content and participants must undergo strict examination. Prisoners who may have negative influences or cause controversy in society should generally not participate in public report performances. Prisoners participating in performances should primarily engage in labor and study, and professional performance teams should not be established.

		The Ministry of Justice has also regulated that audio and video recordings of prisoner performances are strictly prohibited from being published or distributed. Violations of these regulations will result in accountability and serious consequences.

		The Ministry of Justice has made specific regulations on various performance situations to strictly manage prisoner performances.

		The Ministry of Justice requires all labor reform units to strictly implement these regulations and hopes that relevant departments will provide close cooperation, ensuring that prisoner performances can promote reform work and achieve social benefits.

　　司法部对犯人演出作规定
    劳改单位的文艺活动应为改造工作服务
    本报讯  司法部新近对犯人进行文艺演出作出规定，限制演出的范围和内容，强调劳改单位的文艺活动应为改造工作服务，以杜绝这类活动中的混乱现象。
    近年来，不少劳改单位积极探索改造工作新路子，组织犯人进行了一些文艺演出，收到了较好的社会效益。但也出现了一些混乱现象，如有的单位搞营业性演出，让犯人长期在社会上进行巡回表演；有的在演员的挑选上只注意表演才能，忽视改造表现和可能引起的社会反响。这些作法在社会上造成了一些不良影响。为了切实纠正上述混乱现象，司法部作出规定：犯人的文艺演出应主要在劳改场所内进行，如演出水平较高，可有目的、有计划地组织汇报演出，其主要对象应是有关部门和参与帮教活动的单位及犯人亲属，目的在于增进社会对改造罪犯工作的理解和支持，绝不允许搞营业性演出；演出内容以创作节目为主，要鼓励犯人创作并演出宣传劳改工作方针政策，反映改造生活和改造成果的节目；参加演出的犯人必须是认罪服法，改造表现好的，在汇报演出时，对演出节目和参演人员要进行严格审查，对社会上有坏的影响或可能引起争议的犯人，一般不参加对社会的汇报演出；参加演出的犯人，平时仍以劳动、学习为主，不能搞脱产的演出队。
    对犯人演出的录音、录相带，司法部规定一律不准出版发行，对违反规定者要追究责任，严肃处理。
    司法部还对一些具体的演出情况作了专门规定，以严格管理犯人演出。
    司法部要求各劳改单位严格执行规定，也希望各有关部门给予密切配合，使犯人的文艺演出能促进改造工作并取得社会效益。
