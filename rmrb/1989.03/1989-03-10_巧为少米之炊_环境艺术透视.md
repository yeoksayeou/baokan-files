When it comes to environmental art, many people often say, “You need money for that!” Indeed, “a skilled cook can’t make a meal without rice.” But I say, even with money, there often isn’t environmental art. In recent times, haven’t the shopping malls, hotels, and amusement parks built or renovated by certain Hong Kong businessmen (including design firms with a strong commercial spirit) been the best examples of this?

In creative practice, I have long forgotten many of the once-popular slogans, but the phrase “spend less, do more, and do it well” always reminds me to think and act this way. A friend of mine, Dr. Xiang Bingren, a Ph.D. in architecture, says: “Compared to the economic strength of developed countries, even by the beginning of the next century, the gap will still be quite significant. It is both difficult and unreasonable to try to match developed countries in a few aspects of overall architectural level with our meager national strength. Therefore, we can only win by optimizing the overall environment.” Here, I need to extend this idea further: concentrating a very limited amount of financial and material resources on updating the appearance of existing key environments is a wise move to quickly and effectively achieve social benefits.

Without exception, every city in the world is constantly being built and aging, which is the metabolism of the city. The creation of urban environmental art must focus on the “new” side, but it must also pay attention to the “old” side—the latter, in a greater quantity and quality, determines people’s fate! Especially in a country like ours that has not yet shaken off poverty, the task of renovating the three major environments of living, transportation, and production in the city is arduous and challenging. However, in difficult times, as long as we have a global perspective and start planning from our own living and working areas, step by step, bit by bit, even if it is the same place and there are still no new buildings or modern facilities, the environment will be infused with cultural and aesthetic information, making people, to some extent, feel comforted, relaxed, and happy. This psychological compensation is very valuable and can be achieved through “environmental facelifts” (environmental renewal design). Now, people with money are willing to buy houses, and I believe that one day, some economically better-off residents will voluntarily pool money to beautify the external environment around their living areas—because the concept of “home” is expanding to courtyards, alleys, and neighborhoods.

Modern cities are organic entities centered around modern people. The renewal and facelift of old environments also mean consciously maintaining the “ecological balance” in urban development. Ignoring the renovation of the existing old environment, which is closely related to the fate of the broad masses of people, and building high-standard buildings and halls everywhere, even considering a few lonely “facade projects” as unparalleled “achievements,” can only lead to the deformed development of the city. Nobel laureate economist Arthur Lewis believes that high investments in urban construction are the fundamental cause of fiscal deficits in third-world countries. Therefore, reasonably controlling the scale of basic construction is not just a temporary expedient. From this perspective, using “limited resources” to update the old appearance of existing environments, such as a residential community, a commercial street, a campus, or a public activity center, becomes more realistic and necessary. Italian urban designer Wolf said it very vividly and appropriately: “Good buildings do not necessarily create good cities, and bad buildings do not necessarily produce bad cities.”

Please, all the “skilled cooks” in various cities, direct your loving gaze more towards the environments that urgently need updating!

　　巧为少米之炊
    ——环境艺术透视
    布正伟
    一提起环境艺术，常有人说“这得有钱！”的确，“巧妇难为无米之炊”。但我说，有钱也往往没有环境艺术。近一个时期来，经某些港商之手（包括商人气十足的设计事务所）改建或新建的商店、旅馆、游乐场等不就是最好的佐证么！？
    在创作实践中，过去许多红极一时的口号我早已淡忘，唯有“少花钱，多办事，办好事”这句话时时提醒我，为创作构思和实施行为中的本能反映。我的一位朋友、建筑学博士项秉仁先生说：“与发达国家的经济实力相比，即使到下一世纪初，差距仍然相当悬殊，想用微薄的国力，在少数整体建筑水平方面与发达国家匹敌，既是勉为其难，也是不合理的。所以，我们只能靠环境的整体优化去取胜。”在此，我有必要再引伸一步：把极有限的一点财力物力集中投入到现有重点环境面貌的更新上，是既快又好地获得社会效益的明智之举。
    毫无例外，世界上任何一个城市每天都在新建，每天也都在老化，这就是城市的新陈代谢。城市环境艺术的创造，既要盯住“新”的一头，更要观照“老”的一面——后者在更大的量上与质上决定着人们的生活命运！特别是我们这样一个还未摆脱贫穷的大国，城市中现有居住、交通与生产三大环境的改造任务甚为繁重与艰难。然而，在困境中，只要胸怀全局，从自己生活、工作的地区开始，一步一步地去筹划，一点一滴地去实现，那么，即使还是那个地方，即使仍没有新的建筑和现代化设施，却会由于环境文化与环境审美信息的不断渗入而使人在某种程度上得到安抚、宽松和愉悦，这种心理补偿是十分宝贵的，也是可以通过“环境整容”（环境更新设计）得以实现的。现在，有钱的人愿意买住房了，我相信，总有一天，一些经济较富裕的居民会自动凑钱来美化他们生活周围的外部环境的——因为“家”的概念正向着院落、胡同、街坊外延。
    现代城市是一个以现代人为核心的有机体，旧环境的更新、整容也意味着自觉地去维护城市发展中的“生态平衡”。忽视与广大人民群众命运息息相关的现有旧环境的改造，到处乱建高标准的楼堂馆所，甚至将几个孤零零的“门面工程”视为不可一世的“政绩”，这只能导致城市的畸形发展。诺贝尔奖获得者经济学家阿瑟·路易斯认为，在城市建设方面的高额投资是第三世界国家出现财政赤字的根本原因。所以，合理压缩（实质是控制）基本建设规模并非只是一时的权宜之计。这样看来，以“少米之炊”更新现有环境的旧面貌，如一个居住小区、一条商业街、一座学府、一处公共活动中心等，就显得更为现实、更为必要了。意大利城市设计师沃尔夫说得十分精彩而中肯：“好的建筑并不带来好的城市，而差的建筑也并不一定产生坏的城市。”
    请各个城市的“巧妇们”，把深情的眼光更多地投向急待更新的环境面貌上去吧！
