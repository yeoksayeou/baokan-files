The People's Bank of China decided today to allocate an additional 500 million yuan in short-term loans to support large and medium-sized key enterprises and to meet the demand for agricultural funds. Of this amount, the Industrial and Commercial Bank will lend 300 million yuan to key enterprises, and the Agricultural Bank will lend 200 million yuan for agricultural purposes.

The use of these funds will follow the principles of "targeted, specific enterprises, specific amounts, specific purposes, and dedicated use." The banking departments, in coordination with relevant departments of the State Council, have identified 180 key state-owned enterprises currently in urgent need of financial support. Among these, 12 key steel enterprises, including Anshan Iron and Steel, will receive 70 million yuan, and 168 basic industrial enterprises, including Shenyang Cable Factory, will receive 230 million yuan. These loans will be directly allocated to each enterprise to address their funding needs for producing state-mandated plans, specifically for purchasing urgently needed raw materials and fuels. The Agricultural Bank's loans will be used exclusively to meet the financial needs for spring plowing, including pesticides, fertilizers, agricultural films, and seeds.

A relevant official from the People's Bank of China pointed out that this additional loan is aimed at increasing effective supply and promoting economic structural adjustment. The central bank's allocation of 500 million yuan does not indicate a loosening of monetary policy. In the future, macro-control will continue to be strengthened to stabilize monetary circulation.

　　支持重点企业　满足春耕急需
    银行新增贷款五十亿
    本报北京３月１４日讯  金融时报记者杨志翔、张继东报道：中国人民银行总行今天决定再安排５０亿元短期贷款，用于支持大中型重点企业和满足支农资金需要，其中由工商银行对重点企业发放贷款３０亿元，由农业银行发放支农贷款２０亿元。
    这笔资金的使用将采取“定向、定企业、定量、定用途、专款专用”的办法。银行部门已会同国务院有关部门列出了目前急需资金扶持的１８０户国家重点企业，其中鞍钢等１２家重点钢铁企业７亿元，沈阳电缆厂等１６８家基础工业企业２３亿元。这笔贷款将直接落实到每个企业，解决这些企业承担国家指令性计划生产所需资金，专款用于购进当前急需的原材料、燃料等。农业银行的这次贷款只用于解决春耕生产的农药、化肥、农膜和种子的资金需要。
    中国人民银行有关负责人指出，这次新增贷款是为了增加有效供给，促进经济结构的调整。这次中央银行拿出５０亿元，并不是表明放松银根，今后还将继续加强宏观控制，稳定货币流通。
