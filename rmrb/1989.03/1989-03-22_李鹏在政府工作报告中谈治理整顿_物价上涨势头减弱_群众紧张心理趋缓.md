Li Peng, in his government work report, said that over the past half year, efforts to rectify the economic environment and restore economic order have achieved initial results.

Li Peng specifically discussed the situation regarding economic rectification and control.

	— Significant reduction in fixed asset investment scale. By the end of February this year, a total of 18,000 fixed asset investment projects have been suspended or delayed nationwide, which can reduce investment in the coming years by 64.7 billion yuan, accounting for 12% of the remaining work of all projects. However, the goal of cleaning up and reducing the scale has not yet been achieved, and the task remains arduous.

	— Credit scale has been controlled. Banks have played their role as economic levers, and savings deposits of urban and rural residents nationwide have gradually increased.

	— Reduction in social purchasing power. Last year's retail sales decreased by 9.1% compared to the previous year. The collective consumption of county-level and above units increased by 1.8% compared to the previous year. The phenomenon of using public funds for banquets, entertaining, gift-giving, and travel has been reduced in party and government agencies.

	— Nationwide financial, tax, and price inspections have been conducted, uncovering 7.41 billion yuan in funds that should have been turned over to the treasury but were not, of which 5.65 billion yuan have already been turned over. Through these inspections, a number of illegal cases have been handled, and tax, financial, and price management have been initially strengthened.

	— Order in the circulation sector has been rectified. By the end of January this year, 17,092 companies that did not meet the conditions or should not have been established have been closed or merged; of the 24,187 companies operated by party and government agencies, nearly 20,000 have been closed or decoupled from the agencies, accounting for about 80%. The phenomenon of party and government agencies engaging in business and running enterprises has been basically stopped. During the cleanup, a number of illegal and disciplinary cases, including some major ones, have been handled. The work of cleaning up and rectifying companies needs to be further deepened. Management of some important and scarce commodities has been strengthened, which has played a positive role in establishing market order and stabilizing prices.

	— Efforts have been made to increase effective supply. While reducing total social demand, the supply of the domestic market and the needs of foreign trade development have been basically guaranteed.

Li Peng said that after half a year of work, the economy has started to cool down, the momentum of price increases has weakened, the public's anxiety about prices has eased, and urban and rural markets have remained stable.

He said that for the past half year of economic rectification and control, two basic assessments should be made: First, the facts have proven that the policies and measures for economic rectification and control determined by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council are correct. Second, the achievements made so far are only initial ones, and there is still a significant gap between them and the goals of economic rectification and control. He pointed out that many comrades still do not fully understand the necessity and arduousness of economic rectification and control. The difficulty of economic rectification and control itself is great, and it will bring some new difficulties in certain aspects, but if economic rectification and control is not persisted, the difficulties on all fronts will be even greater. We can only face the difficulties head-on and cannot give up halfway.

　　李鹏在政府工作报告中谈治理整顿        
    物价上涨势头减弱   
    群众紧张心理趋缓
    新华社北京３月２１日电  李鹏总理在政府工作报告中说，半年来，治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序取得了初步成效。
    李鹏具体谈到了治理整顿的情况。
    ——大力压缩固定资产投资规模。截至今年２月底，全国已经停建缓建固定资产投资项目１８０００个，可压缩今后几年的投资６４７亿元，占全部项目剩余工作量的１２％。但是，清理、压缩的目标尚未达到，任务还十分艰巨。
    ——信贷规模得到控制。银行发挥经济杠杆的作用，全国城乡居民储蓄存款逐步回升。
    ——压缩社会集团购买力。去年的零售额比上年下降９．１％。县以上单位去年的集团消费比上年增长１．８％。利用公款吃喝、请客、送礼、旅游等现象，在党政机关有所减少。
    ——开展了全国性的财务、税收、物价大检查，共查出应上交财政的违纪金额７４．１亿元，已上交５６．５亿元。通过检查，处理了一批违法案件，初步加强了税收、财务和物价管理。
    ——整顿流通领域的秩序。截至今年１月底，已撤并不具备条件和不该办的公司１７０９２个；在党政机关办的２４１８７个公司中，已有近两万个撤并或同机关脱钩，约占８０％。党政机关经商办企业的现象，已基本得到制止。在清理中查处了一批违法违纪案件，其中包括一些大案要案。清理整顿公司的工作，还要继续深入进行下去。对一些重要产品和紧俏商品加强了管理，对建立市场秩序和稳定物价起了积极作用。
    ——努力增加有效供给。在压缩社会总需求的同时，基本上保证了国内市场的供应和发展对外贸易的需要。
    李鹏说，经过半年来的工作，经济过热开始降温，物价上涨势头有所减弱，群众对物价的紧张心理有所缓和，城乡市场基本稳定。
    他说，对半年来的治理整顿，应该作两点基本估计：第一，事实证明，中共中央、国务院确定的治理整顿的方针政策和措施是正确的。第二，已经取得的成效仅仅是初步的，同治理整顿所要达到的目标还有很大的差距。他指出，现在还有不少同志对治理整顿的必要性和艰巨性认识不足。治理整顿本身的难度很大，还会在某些方面带来一些新的困难，但如果不坚持治理整顿，各方面的困难会更大。我们只能知难而进，决不能半途而废。
