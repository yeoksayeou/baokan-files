The epic film "The Founding Ceremony" is in full swing of shooting. It will be released to the audience on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, March 2 (Reporter Chen Meifeng) The red flags are fluttering on Tiananmen Gate Tower, and tens of thousands of Beijing citizens are surging towards the Golden Water Bridge. They are looking at Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and other national leaders, as well as many famous democratic figures and high-ranking generals, appearing on the tower with awe and admiration. Suddenly, Tiananmen Square is filled with cheers.

This is a scene from the epic historical film "The Founding Ceremony" being shot by Changchun Film Studio.

"The Founding Ceremony," directed by Li Qiankuan and Xiao Guiyun, two middle-aged directors from Changchun Film Studio, vividly recreates the earth-shaking changes that took place before the birth of New China. It depicts the historical fact that the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang, led by Chiang Kai-shek, made different choices in history, one leading to victory and the other to failure.

In this film, 138 named historical figures from both the Communist and Kuomintang sides appear, which is a first in Chinese film history. The film focuses on portraying the psychological states of the leaders of both sides during the most turbulent period in Chinese history, expressing their true emotions. To this end, writers Zhang Tianmin, Zhang Xiaotian, Liu Xing, and Guo Chen have studied a large amount of historical materials and interviewed many people who have worked with the leaders.

The film features the best actors in the country who specialize in portraying leaders. Gu Yue plays Mao Zedong, Guo Fazeng plays Liu Shaoqi, Huang Kai plays Zhou Enlai, Lu Qi plays Deng Xiaoping, and Chiang Kai-shek is played by Sun Feihu.

"The Founding Ceremony" is divided into two parts, with a grand scale and a total investment of 6 million yuan. It is the most expensive film ever produced by Changchun Film Studio.

It is reported that the filming crew has completed the outdoor scenes of Tiananmen Gate Tower, Xibeipo, and the Huaihai Campaign, as well as some indoor scenes. In early March, they will go to Fengxia, Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places to shoot outdoor scenes. The plan is to stop filming in June this year and be released to the audience on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

　　历史巨片《开国大典》正加紧拍摄
    建国４０周年之际将与观众见面
    新华社长春３月２日电  （记者陈美凤）天安门城楼上红旗飘扬，成千上万的北京市民涌向金水桥，他们怀着惊奇而敬慕的目光，远望着毛泽东、朱德、刘少奇、周恩来等国家领导人以及众多的著名民主人士和高级将领出现在城楼上。顿时，天安门广场一片欢腾。
    这是长春电影制片厂正在拍摄的历史故事巨片《开国大典》中的一个镜头。
    这部由长影厂中年导演李前宽和肖桂云执导的《开国大典》，以新中国诞生前发生的翻天覆地的变化为背景，形象地再现了中国共产党人和国民党蒋介石，在历史的抉择中，一方走向胜利，一方走向失败的历史事实。
    在这部影片中，出现了１３８位有名有姓的国共双方的真实历史人物，这在中国电影史上还是首次。影片着力刻画中国历史最动荡时期的国共双方领袖人物的心态，表现他们的真情实感。为此，作家张天民、张笑天和刘星、郭晨四位编剧研究了大量史料，访问了许多在领袖身边工作过的当事人。
    影片荟萃了全国塑造领袖形象的特型演员。古月饰演毛泽东，郭法曾饰演刘少奇，黄凯饰演周恩来，卢奇饰演邓小平，蒋介石由孙飞虎扮演。
    《开国大典》分上下集，气魄宏大，总投资６００万元。是长影建厂以来耗资最大的一部影片。
    据透露，目前，摄制组已拍完天安门城楼、西柏坡和淮海战役的外景及部分内景。３月初将赴奉化、南京、上海等地拍外景。计划今年６月份停机，在建国４０周年之际与观众见面。
