The China Film Group (CFG) is taking steps to support and promote artistic exploration films. In 1988, a total of 159 feature films were produced nationwide, with over 80% being entertainment films. Only a few, such as "Late Bell" and "Arc Light," can be considered exploration films. Even these two exploration films had modest sales, reflecting a trend where local film distribution and screening companies are reluctant to order exploration films. This situation, coupled with the fact that some audiences want to watch these films but cannot, has led to a stagnation in the exploration and experimentation of film art forms.

To address this issue, the CFG has decided to use economic measures to support and encourage the production of exploration films starting this year. The specific approach involves the CFG purchasing some exploration films and providing them to cinemas nationwide for free. The screening costs will be covered by the provincial and municipal film companies. The revenue from ticket sales will be shared among the screening venues, local companies, and the CFG. The CFG does not intend to generate income from this initiative.

Currently, it has been preliminarily agreed that exploration films will be screened in ten cinemas across nine cities nationwide.

    中影公司扶持艺术探索片
    本报讯  １９８８年全国生产了１５９部故事片，娱乐片占了８０％多，而可称为探索片的大概只有《晚钟》和《弧光》。就是这两部探索片订数也不甚理想，鉴于这种地方电影发行放映公司不订探索片，部分观众想看又看不到，电影艺术形式的探索和试验趋于停顿的局面，中影公司决定今年起用经济手段扶持和提倡探索片。
    具体做法是由中影公司出钱买下一些探索片，免费供全国各地上映，而各地放映场的费用由省市公司贴。售票所得由放映场、地方公司和中影公司三方分享。中影公司不打算从这方面得到什么收入。目前已初步商定全国９个城市十家影院上映这种探索片。
