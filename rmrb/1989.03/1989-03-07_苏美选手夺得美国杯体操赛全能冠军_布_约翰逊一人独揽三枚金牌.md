According to a foreign wire report, Vitaly Marinich of the Soviet Union and Beth Johnson of the United States each won the all-around titles in the men's and women's divisions, respectively, at the 1989 U.S. Cup International Gymnastics Championships held in Virginia yesterday.

Marinich maintained a lead from start to finish in the men's all-around competition. Americans Lance Linaard and Patrick Korksi took the second and third places, respectively. Fifteen-year-old Beth Johnson won three gold medals in the women's floor exercise, vault, and uneven bars, and also claimed the women's all-around title. She only finished as the runner-up in the balance beam event due to a mistake. The defending champion, American gymnast Millis, won the balance beam title.
