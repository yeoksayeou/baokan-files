A student who recently returned from studying in Japan told me two pieces of news. Although they lack timely news value, they are quite refreshing to hear.

He said, "Pianos in Japanese households have become items to be discarded, at most they are kept as 'property' and 'decorations.'" When I asked why, he laughed and replied, "They are too noisy and are universally recognized as the king of household noise!" At first, this seemed unexpected, but upon closer thought, it made sense.

He also told me, "Similar to the reluctance to welcome pianos, Japan has seen a recent surge in 'silent' home appliances, which have become popular nationwide." When I asked for details, it was quite fascinating.

Last year, Hitachi Electric Company first introduced a fully automatic low-noise washing machine with the label "silent." As soon as it hit the market, it was snatched up, and users praised it endlessly. This washing machine, named "Silent Lady," is extremely quiet from startup to use, draining, kneading, and spinning.

Hitachi's success immediately prompted other electronics companies to follow suit and surpass them, all rushing to introduce various "silent" home appliances. The market suddenly became rich, and competition intensified. Recently, Hitachi Company introduced a new type of washing machine that reduces noise by half and shortens drying time by nearly half, which is highly popular among users. At the beginning of this year, Toshiba Company quickly caught up, becoming the first in Japan to introduce a "silent" washing machine with a coated layer. It added a layer of specially made "synthetic film" inside the metal tub, not only reducing friction between various parts to the lowest possible level but also reducing the friction of hard objects like buttons on clothes with the parts. This achieves the goal of being "silent" and extends the life of both the machine and the clothes.

Major companies have developed and introduced a series of "silent" home appliances, making "silent" improvements to essential home appliances such as refrigerators, fans, and vacuum cleaners. Among these, the "silent" improvement of vacuum cleaners has been the most effective. Recently, a "silent vacuum cleaner" has been popular in Japan. Its micro-motor noise is originally not loud, but it is now tightly wrapped with a high-quality "soundproof film," making it almost inaudible when used. Recently, a "self-adjusting silent vacuum cleaner" has been introduced, which can automatically adjust the suction power according to the different materials of the floor.

### “静音”家电风靡日本

　　“静音”家电风靡日本
    柯宝成
    一位刚从日本留学归来的学生告诉我两则消息，虽无新闻时效，但听来颇感新鲜。
    他说：“钢琴在日本家庭里已成了清除对象，至多是纯作‘家当’和‘摆设’。”惊问其故，笑答：“太吵人了，公认是家庭噪音之魁首！”乍听似在意料之外，粗想却在情理之中。
    他又告诉我：“与不欢迎钢琴出于一辙，日本近年‘静音’家电勃然兴起，风靡全国。”询问其详，令人神往。
    去年，日立电器公司首次推出标有“静音”字样的全自动低噪音洗衣机。它一露头，就被抢购一空，使用者赞不绝口。这种命名“静御前”的洗衣机，从启动到使用，排水、揉洗、甩干，声音极小。
    日立的成功，立即引起各家电公司的效仿和赶超，也纷纷推出各种“静音”家电。市场陡然丰富，竞争日益剧烈。日立公司最近又推出了新型洗衣机，噪音减少一半，烘干时间也缩短近半，大受用户欢迎。今年初，东芝公司急起直追，在日本首先推出一种加膜的“静音型洗衣机”，它比“静御前”更进了一步。设计者在金属内槽里，巧妙地加铺了一层特制的“合成薄膜”，不仅可最低限度地降低各机件间的磨擦，还能减低衣服的纽扣等硬物与机件的磨擦。这既达到了“静音”的目的，又延长了机子和衣物的使用寿命。
    各大公司研制和推出了系列“静音”家电，对冰箱、电扇、吸尘器等必备家电都在作“静音化”改进。其中以吸尘器的“静音化”最有成效。最近，日本畅销一种“静音吸尘器”，其微型马达噪音本来不大，现又在外围用精制的“消音膜”严密包封，使用起来，几乎听不见昔日那令人讨厌的噪音了。日前，又推出了一种可以根据地板不同材质而自动调节吸尘力的“自动静音吸尘器”。
