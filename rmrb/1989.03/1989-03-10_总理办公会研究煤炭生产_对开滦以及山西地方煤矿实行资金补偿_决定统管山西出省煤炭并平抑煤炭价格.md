The State Council pays great attention to the current situation of energy production and development in our country. On March 8, it convened another meeting of the Premier's Office to discuss and resolve issues related to the production, transportation, and relevant policies of local coal mines in Shanxi Province and the Kailuan Coal Mine. Premier Li Peng presided over the meeting. Shanxi Province Governor Wang Shenhao and Minister of Energy Huang Yiqing made separate reports.

The meeting noted that the most prominent issue facing the national economy at present is the shortage of energy, which is reflected in the power supply but essentially indicates problems in coal production and transportation, particularly in coal production, where potential risks need to be addressed seriously.

The meeting acknowledged the outstanding contributions made by local coal mines in Shanxi Province during the reform process. Considering the specific difficulties faced by Shanxi's local coal mines in their current development, the Premier's Office meeting, after deliberation, decided to implement new financial compensation measures for Shanxi's local coal mines, in addition to maintaining existing preferential policies, to promote local coal production. The meeting also decided that the State Planning Commission would take the lead, along with the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Materials, Ministry of Railways, Ministry of Communications, State Price Bureau, and Shanxi Province, to establish a coal transportation leadership group responsible for the overall management and coordination of coal exports from Shanxi Province; and to establish a company to manage coal transportation and related business operations, reducing intermediate links, extracting some funds, and stabilizing coal prices. The Premier's Office meeting also discussed the issues of grain and timber needed by local coal mines in Shanxi Province and proposed solutions.

The Premier's Office meeting also studied the issues of the Kailuan Coal Mine. This mine has made significant contributions to the country in the past. Given the mine's past experiences with earthquakes, floods, and current difficulties, it was decided to allocate a certain amount of funds from the national budget to provide subsidies.

The Premier's Office meeting also discussed and deliberated on economic policy issues related to the entire coal industry.

Yao Yilin and Wang Baoqian attended the meeting. Relevant officials from the State Council's departments participated in the meeting.

　　总理办公会研究煤炭生产
    对开滦以及山西地方煤矿实行资金补偿
    决定统管山西出省煤炭并平抑煤炭价格
    新华社北京３月９日电  国务院对当前我国的能源生产发展情况十分重视，３月８日又一次召开总理办公会议，研究解决山西省地方煤矿和开滦煤矿的生产、调运及有关政策问题。李鹏总理主持了会议。山西省长王森浩和能源部长黄毅诚分别作了汇报。
    会议认为，目前国民经济面临的突出问题是能源紧缺，表现在“电”上，实质上反映的是煤炭生产和运输中存在的问题，尤其在煤炭生产方面潜伏着隐患，需要认真加以解决。
    会议肯定了山西省地方煤矿在改革中做出的突出贡献。鉴于山西省地方煤矿在当前发展中存在的具体困难，总理办公会议经研究议定：对山西省地方煤矿除原有的优惠政策不变外，实行新的资金补偿措施，以促进地方煤炭的生产。会议同时决定，由国家计委牵头，能源部、物资部、铁道部、交通部、国家物价局和山西省参加，成立煤炭调运领导小组，负责山西省出省煤炭的统筹管理和协调；并成立一个公司统一管理煤炭调运及有关业务工作，以减少中间环节，挤出部分资金，平抑煤炭价格。总理办公会议还研究了山西省地方煤矿所需的粮食和坑木问题，并提出了解决办法。
    总理办公会议还研究了开滦煤矿问题。这个矿过去为国家作出过很大贡献，鉴于这个矿曾遭受地震、水灾和当前困难很大的实际情况，决定从国家财政中拿出一定资金给予补贴。
    总理办公会议还研究讨论了整个煤炭行业的经济政策问题。
    姚依林、王丙乾出席了会议。国务院有关部门的负责同志参加了会议。
