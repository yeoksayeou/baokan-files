King Fahd of Saudi Arabia visits Egypt

Two countries to determine Middle East peace talks stance and develop economic and trade cooperation

CAIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Today afternoon, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia led a large high-level government delegation from Iraq to Egypt, beginning a four-day official visit. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak embraced and kissed King Fahd of Saudi Arabia at Cairo Airport. This is the first time King Fahd has visited Egypt since his coronation in 1982, marking a new chapter in the two countries' relations after a well-known period of cooling down.

Today at 4 PM, an unprecedented grand welcoming ceremony was held at Cairo Airport and the Presidential Palace of Qubbah. The two heads of state inspected the three military honor guards. The Egyptian Prime Minister and all cabinet members were present to welcome them. Saudi Arabia's ministers of foreign affairs, petroleum, planning, news, and other cabinet members met with President Mubarak one by one. Tonight, President Mubarak hosted a grand state banquet to welcome the Saudi guests.

According to reports, King Fahd will visit Cairo, Suez, Ismailia, and Alexandria.

Saudi Arabia and Egypt formally resumed diplomatic relations on November 16, 1987. President Mubarak visited Saudi Arabia for the first time in early 1988, and high-level officials from both countries have frequently visited each other.

President Mubarak will hold formal talks with King Fahd. According to reports, the talks will cover Middle East issues, especially the latest developments following the US-Israeli talks and the promotion of the Middle East peace conference, forming a unified Arab stance before President Mubarak's visit to the US. King Fahd will personally mediate the relations between Egypt and Syria, prepare for the next Arab League summit, and formally restore Egypt's membership.

The talks will also focus on further promoting economic cooperation between the two countries, creating favorable conditions for Saudi Arabia's investment and trade with Egypt. King Fahd recently instructed the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency to provide Egypt with a $2 billion loan for food imports.

　　法赫德国王访问埃及        
    两国将确定中东和谈立场　发展经贸合作
    本报开罗３月２７日电  记者林皎明报道：今天下午，沙特阿拉伯国王法赫德率领庞大的高级政府代表团从伊拉克飞抵埃及，开始为期４天的正式访问。埃及总统穆巴拉克在开罗机场与沙特阿拉伯国王法赫德拥抱亲吻。这是法赫德国王自１９８２年加冕以来第１次出访埃及，也是两国关系经历过一段人所共知的冷却时期后重修旧好的新的一页。
    今天下午４时，开罗机场和总统府库巴宫前举行空前盛大的欢迎仪式，两国元首检阅了三军仪仗队。埃及总理率全体阁员在场迎候。陪同国王前来访问的沙特外交、石油、计划、新闻等内阁大臣依次与穆巴拉克总统会见。今天晚间，埃及总统设大型国宴欢迎沙特贵宾。
    据报道，法赫德国王将访问开罗、苏伊士、伊斯梅利亚、亚历山大等城市。
    沙埃两国于１９８７年１１月１６日正式恢复外交关系。穆巴拉克总统１９８８年初首访沙特，两国高级官员频频互访。
    穆巴拉克总统将与法赫德国王举行正式会谈。据报道，会谈将涉及中东问题，特别是有关美巴会谈后的最新事态及推动中东和会等问题，在穆巴拉克总统访美前夕形成阿拉伯一致立场。沙特国王将亲自出面调解埃及和叙利亚两国关系，筹备召开下届阿盟首脑会议，以便正式恢复埃及盟员地位。
    会谈还将着重研究进一步增进两国经济合作，为沙特在埃及投资和贸易往来增设便利条件。法赫德国王最近指示沙特银行向埃及提供２０亿美元食品进口贷款。
