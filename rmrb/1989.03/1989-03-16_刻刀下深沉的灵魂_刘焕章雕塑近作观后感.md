The Soul Beneath the Chisel
—Reflections on Liu Huanzhang's Recent Sculptures
Qian Shaowu

I remember a few years ago, Huanzhang shocked the Chinese art world with his astonishing artistic labor. At that time, he exhibited over 300 pieces. Everyone knows these were all carved out with immense effort! The stubborn old herdsman, the pure-hearted young girl, and various other figures including birds, beasts, insects, and fish, all were created with a pure and natural simplicity that people still remember vividly. At that time, not long after the Gang of Four was overthrown, the art world was still quite stagnant. I described that exhibition as a refreshing breeze. Now, just a few years later, he has new works to present. Here, a few pieces are from 1983 and still show some developmental trajectory, but most of the works reveal a completely new realm. The depth of thought and emotion, the breadth of creative ideas, and the freedom of artistic style are unprecedented and unimaginable from a few years ago.

"Starting Out" (see below) seems to be a general theme—a mother holding a child. But this is not the everyday affection between mother and child; rather, it affirms the solemn and magnificent future of humanity, like the earth itself, watching its child take the first dignified and sacred step. It is this profound understanding that led him to adopt such a solemn form. Here, not a hint of a smile, a bit of relaxation, or a small amusement is allowed. Even more specific details would ruin this comprehensive representation of all humanity. "Reunion" seems to have been prepared by fate with this strange piece of wood. With bold strokes, he carved out two old friends reuniting after a long separation, their deep affection for each other evident. If you have experienced the turmoil of those chaotic years, you will surely resonate with this warm feeling. "Stormy Weather" is another piece of broken wood, seemingly weathered by water and scorched by fire, truly battered and bruised. Through it, Huanzhang expresses the cry of a wounded soul, and we feel her trembling body and bleeding heart. "Heavy Wings" gives me a sense of "resilient yet sorrowful." With just a few strokes, almost imperceptibly, he carved out an indescribable emotion. Perhaps it is a proud eagle. But these heavy wings! He reveals the common sentiment of Chinese intellectuals, truly "there is only one thing to worry about in the world...!" With every step you take, with every action you perform, you deeply feel this pair of "heavy wings." No wonder Huanzhang told me that sometimes when he sculpts, he can't help but want to cry.

Yes, I understand his art more deeply now, and I understand that he is a Chinese intellectual with the tradition of Qu Yuan. He, with the eyes and hands of a true sculptor, embodies the feelings of a true Chinese person. He, like everyone else, has breathed in the wind of openness. He has absorbed the principles of free composition from constructivism and some aspects of abstract art. Brancusi and Henry Moore probably had an influence on him. He also absorbed the bold transformations from the stone carvings of the Mausoleum of Wei Qing, but he organically fused all of these into one, into the heart of a Chinese artist. He has developed the Chinese tradition of "freehand brushwork," achieving a state of "seeming yet not seeming," neither pandering nor deceiving. His technique is free, almost "abstract," but the emotions he expresses are precise and concrete. He has opened up a vast artistic realm for himself, but through all the changes, he remains true to his original purpose—to express emotion, to express the sorrowful joy of a modern Chinese person.

　　刻刀下深沉的灵魂
    ——刘焕章雕塑近作观后感
    钱绍武
    记得前几年焕章以他惊人的艺术劳动震撼了我国艺术界。那次他共展出了三百余件作品。大家知道这都是千锤万凿打出来的呵！那倔强的老牧民，单纯的小姑娘，以及其他各种形象包括鸟、兽、虫、鱼，都做得纯厚质朴，清新自然，直到现在让人们难以忘怀。当时，打倒“四人帮”不久艺术界还比较沉闷。我形容那次展出像扑面而来的一股清风。现在不过几年他却又有了新的奉献。这里除少数几件是八三年的作品，还多少显示着发展的轨迹，但大部分作品却展示了一个崭新的境界。思想感情的深广，创作思路的开阔，艺术风格的自由都是前所未曾有，也是前几年不可想象的。
    《起步》（见下图）似乎是个一般性的题材——母亲抱孩子。但这绝不是生活情趣的母子情，而是肯定着人类庄严伟大的前程，像大地一般的母亲看着自己的孩子迈出这尊严神圣的第一步。正是这种深沉的理解使他采取了如此庄重的形式。在这里，一丝微笑，一点轻松，一个小趣味都不能允许。甚至更具体一点的细节也会破坏这种概括全人类的内涵。《相逢》，不知怎的天地间给他准备了这段奇怪的木头。他大刀阔斧地略加雕凿，两个久别重逢的挚友，把臂相问的深情令人心会。如果你经过那动乱年代的生死考验，那么肯定会引起温煦的共鸣。《风雨飘摇》又是一段破木头，本身像是经过了水的侵蚀和火的燎烤，真是遍体鳞伤。焕章通过它喊出了一个受伤的灵魂的哀号，我们感觉到她的颤抖的身子和流血的心。《沉重的翅膀》这块石头首先给我一种“顽艳”凄厉之感。只用了寥寥几刀几乎不着痕迹地刻画了一种难以形容的心情。大概是一只心高于天的雄鹰吧。但是这沉重的翅膀呵！他披露了中国知识分子的共同心情，真是“天下可忧外一事……！”你每走一步、你每干一事就深深地感受到这副“沉重的翅膀”。难怪焕章告诉我他有时做雕塑几乎止不住地想大哭一场。
    是的，我更理解他的艺术了，更理解他是有着屈子传统的中国知识分子。他是以真正雕刻家的眼睛和手体现了一个真正中国人的心情。他像大家一样呼吸到了开放之风，他吸收了自由组合的构成主义，他吸收了抽象主义的某些原则。布朗左希和亨利摩尔大概都对他起了作用。他又吸收了霍去病墓的随石赋形敢于大胆变形，但他都能有机地把它们熔于一炉，融于一个中国艺术家的心田里，他发挥了中国的“写意”传统，他做到了“似与不似之间”，既不媚俗也不欺世。他的手法是自由的，几乎是“抽象”的，但他所表达的情感是确切的、具体的。他已为自己开辟了一个广阔的艺术天地，但万变不离其宗——为了“抒情”，为了表达一个现代中国人的悲伤的欢乐。
