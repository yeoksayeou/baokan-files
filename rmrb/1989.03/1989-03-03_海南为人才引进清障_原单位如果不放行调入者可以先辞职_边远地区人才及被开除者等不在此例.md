Hainan Clears Obstacles for Talent Attraction
Original Units That Refuse to Release Personnel Can Be Resigned First
Talent from Remote Areas and Those Dismissed Are Not Included

HAIKOU, March 2 (Xinhua) — Hainan Province has recently issued a regulation stating that any technical personnel from outside the province who are urgently needed by Hainan and have a unit willing to accept them can be recruited after resigning from their original positions and passing an examination. Analysts here believe that this reform breaks through the old system of single transfers, overcomes a major obstacle in Hainan's talent attraction work, and ensures that technical talents willing to participate in the construction of the special zone will not be hindered by their original units refusing to release them.

The "Provisional Regulations on the Recruitment of Technical Personnel from Outside the Province Who Have Resigned from Public Positions," jointly issued by the Hainan Provincial Department of Personnel and Labor, Public Security, Finance, and Grain departments, includes the following specific provisions:

Technical personnel with intermediate professional titles and qualifications, whose performance is outstanding, whose major is in short supply in Hainan, and who are urgently needed and accepted by state-owned enterprises and institutions in Hainan, can resign from their original units. As long as they have a certificate of resignation from their unit or local personnel department, and after the Hainan Provincial Talent Exchange Service Center retrieves their files for review, confirms their original state cadre status, and passes a strict political and professional examination, they can be recruited within the limits of the "small government" personnel quota. Their continuous service years, original salary treatment, professional titles, and positions will be recognized, and their household registration and grain oil relationship will be transferred.

Principally, the regulations do not apply to personnel from Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Gansu, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. Personnel from national defense and military industries, as well as those dismissed or expelled by their units, are also not covered by these regulations.

Graduates of colleges and universities who do not obey national assignments and have worked for less than a year without being confirmed in their positions are not within the scope of recruitment.

    海南为人才引进清障
    原单位如果不放行调入者可以先辞职
    边远地区人才及被开除者等不在此例
    本报海口3月2日电　记者罗自苏报道：海南省最近作出一项规定，凡是海南急需、又有单位同意接收的省外科技人员，辞去原职后，经考试合格，就可以吸收录用。此间分析家认为，这项改革突破了单一商调的旧制，克服了海南引进人才工作中的一大障碍，使那些志愿来琼参加特区建设的科技人才不至于因原单位不肯放行而办不成正常调动。
    由海南省人事劳动厅会同公安、财税、粮食部门作出的《关于吸收录用省外辞去公职的科技人员的暂行规定》，具体内容包括：
    取得中级职称和中级职称任职资格、成绩突出的科技人员，所学专业是海南紧缺的，又是海南全民所有制企、事业单位急需而同意接收的，如原所在单位不同意放行，本人辞职后，只要持有所在单位或当地人事部门同意辞职的证明书，经海南省人才交流服务中心索取档案审查，证明其原有国家干部身份，并在政治表现和专业技术水平上经严格考核合格后，在不突破“小政府”编制的前提下，可以吸收录用。承认其连续工龄、原工资待遇、职称、职务，并给予办理户口、粮油关系迁入。
    西藏、新疆、内蒙古、宁夏、青海、甘肃、云南、贵州、广西等省区的，原则上不按以上规定办理；国防军工单位及被单位开除、除名的均不按以上规定办理。
    大中专毕业生不服从国家分配的，工作不满一年未转正的，不属于吸收录用范围。
