Hu Zhan Shan, 49, graduated from Dalian Institute of Technology in 1964. He previously served as the director of Jinxi Chemical Machinery Plant and became the mayor of Jinzhou in 1985. Last year, he was elected as a representative of the 7th National People's Congress.

When I heard that Representative Hu Zhan Shan had shared his views on controlling prices during a group discussion, I took the opportunity to interview him during a break.

Mayor Hu appeared energetic and still excited from the discussion. He said, "After listening to Premier Li Peng's report, I feel very inspired. Premier Li Peng's report not only highlighted achievements but also addressed problems, and more importantly, it provided specific measures for rectification and deepening reforms. As representatives of the National People's Congress, we should offer more suggestions to help the country solve its difficulties. Therefore, I raised five suggestions on controlling prices during the discussion."

First, the state should decide not to introduce any new price adjustment projects by the end of June this year, and make minimal adjustments in the second half of the year if necessary. For the sake of the overall interest, the State Council should require all provinces and cities to do the same.

Second, the state price authorities should strictly control the factory prices of production materials, raw materials, and scarce products. For issues such as rebates, deposits, advance payments, or blatant overpricing, the state should take decisive action to regulate and severely punish violators.

Third, establish a special price adjustment fund for daily necessities and sideline products to support production in this area and to subsidize state-owned commerce in stabilizing prices. The fund can be sourced from 1-2% of the price increase portion of the main products that were raised last year, or 1-2‰ of the product sales revenue.

Fourth, in commercial enterprises and large agricultural markets, promote price reduction and profit-sharing sales. Reduce prices to a reasonable level and reasonable profit margin. Jinzhou City used this method at the end of last year to stabilize prices, and the city's price increase index was the lowest in the province.

Fifth, relevant state departments should conduct thorough research on any price adjustment measures that need to be introduced.

Hu Zhan Shan said, "Only when prices are stable, can the market and financial sectors be stable, and people's minds be stable, and society be stable."

　　胡占山谈控制物价对策        
    各地上半年不搞新的调价项目　严格原材料及紧俏产品出厂价       
    建立日用品专用价格调节基金　市场和商店开展降价让利赛销

    （胡占山，４９岁，１９６４年毕业于大连工学院，曾任锦西化工机械厂厂长，１９８５年出任锦州市市长，去年当选七届全国人大代表。）
    听说胡占山代表在小组讨论会上发表了控制物价的见解，记者利用休息时间采访了他。
    胡市长看上去精力充沛，脸上还带着讨论会上的兴奋。他说：“听了李鹏总理的报告，心情非常振奋，李鹏总理的报告既讲了成绩，也讲了问题，更重要的是有治理整顿、深化改革的具体措施。作为人大代表，我们应该多提些建议，帮助国家解决困难。所以我在讨论会上就控制物价问题提了五点建议。”
    第一，国家要下决心在今年６月底以前不出台新的调价项目，下半年视情况作极少的调整。为了大局利益，国务院应要求各省、市都这样做。
    第二，国家物价部门要严格把住生产资料、原材料和紧俏产品厂家的出厂价格。对于回扣、定金、预交款或明目张胆多加价的问题，国家要下决心管住，严惩违反者。
    第三，建立人民日常生活用品和副食品等专用的价格调节基金，作为扶持这方面的生产和国营商业平抑物价的补贴。调节基金来源可从去年涨价的主要品种涨价部分中收缴１—２％，或产品销售收入的１—２‰。
    第四，在商业企业和大的农贸市场开展降价让利赛销。把价格降到合理部位、合理利润率。锦州市去年底就是用这个办法，稳住了物价，全市物价上涨指数在全省最低。
    第五，国家有关部门，对要出台的调价措施做好调研。
    胡占山说，只有物价稳定，市场和金融界才能稳定，人心才能稳定，社会才能安定。
