March 10th of this year marked the 30th anniversary of the armed rebellion by the reactionary upper class in Tibet. March 20th marked the 30th anniversary of the order by the CCP Tibet Work Committee and the Tibet Military Region to pacify the rebellion in Tibet. These two dates, along with the events of 30 years ago, have left a deep impression on the current Vice Chairman of the Tibet Political Consultative Conference and former Tibetan military commander, La Ru·Qíwàngduōjí. Facing the reporter's interview, he recalled the events leading up to and following the incident.

It was a windy March. La Ru·Qíwàngduōjí, a third-rank official in the Kashag (the original Tibetan local government), had not yet realized that he was at a crossroads in his life. The Kashag government valued him, and the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army also treated him well.

The incident began with the Dalai Lama's intention to watch a performance at the military region. At that time, the Dalai Lama had a good relationship with the military leaders. Hearing that the military region's cultural troupe had introduced new performances from the interior, the Dalai Lama was very interested. The cultural troupe had also performed exclusively for the Dalai Lama at the Potala Palace, but some large-scale performances required complex lighting and stage sets. Therefore, the Dalai Lama proposed to the deputy commander of the military region, Deng Shaodong, and the secretary of the work committee, Guo Xilan, to go to the military region to watch the performance, and chose the auspicious day of the first day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar, March 10th.

La Ru recalled: "I often went to the military region. I remember clearly, the play was called 'Red Dawn.'"

However, that morning, a rumor spread: "The military region plans to kidnap the Dalai Lama under the pretext of watching a performance." The rumor spread like wildfire in Lhasa. Devout Buddhists and admirers of the Dalai Lama, hearing the rumor, swarmed to Norbulingka (the Dalai Lama's summer palace) like bees, hoping to prevent the Dalai Lama from going to the military region to watch the performance.

The rumor was spread by a low-level monk official in Norbulingka named Danma Jia. This is what La Ru heard from his cellmate, Cidan Pingcuo, after being imprisoned for participating in the rebellion. Cidan Pingcuo was a member of the fake People's Congress and knew many secrets, but later died in prison.

La Ru did not believe the rumor. But he also knew that the common people were easily swayed by rumors. "History and reality often have many similarities," he interjected. The recent unrest in Lhasa also had a background of rumors. Rumormongers often exploit the feelings of believers towards the Dalai Lama to stir up trouble, and many people are deceived, rising up in a frenzy and becoming increasingly uncontrollable. On March 10, 1959, it was exactly like this. The angry mob at the gate of Norbulingka beat to death the patriotic monk official Kangjun Sanglang Zangcuo, tied his body to a horse, and paraded it around to show the crowd. Someone shouted: "This is the fate of those who are close to the Communists." This scene escalated the rebellion, and more people were drawn into it. This was exactly what the plotters had hoped for; they were already sharpening their swords.

The 37-year-old third-rank official La Ru did not have time to make a choice in history when history chose him. On March 11th, he received an order to attend an emergency meeting at Norbulingka. At this meeting, the Zimikyinba revealed the "Tibet Independence" banner, with the chief speaker being the acting secretary, Jueding·Dudun Nuosang. In fact, "independence" was not new. The struggle for "independence" and against "independence" in Tibetan history had occurred many times. But this time, the "independence" faction was ready for a fierce battle, and the so-called regular army had already been deployed, and the irregular militia from places like Kham were also ready for battle. La Ru was also eager to try his hand. He used the Tibetan proverb "take the egg without disturbing the chicken" to explain his battle plan, gaining some applause.

On March 12th, he went to the Potala Palace for a meeting on the "snow" ground. It was at this meeting that he was elected as the commander-in-chief of the Tibetan army, and at the same time, two monks and two laymen, four fourth-rank officials, were elected as deputy commanders. This was somewhat unexpected. Perhaps the officials valued his literary and military skills, or perhaps his speech the previous day showed his command abilities. He had no time to think about it.

La Ru said that, in his own opinion, he hoped to ease the situation. The battle of Chamdo had made him deeply aware of the strength of the People's Liberation Army. But since things had come to this, there was no choice but to fight to the end. The first thing he did after taking office was to check the list of participants, and then he went to inspect the battlefield. After that, he also inquired about the military equipment of the temples and the deployment of troops at the back doors of the temples, and the defense of important crossings. He was busy all day, and his work efficiency was not low.

However, La Ru was a short-lived commander. Due to internal strife, someone did not serve him, and his predecessor did not want to give way. In the afternoon of the 13th, at a chaotic meeting, his command was "removed" by someone.

After that, the Dalai Lama was persuaded to flee at midnight on March 17th, and then on March 20th, the People's Liberation Army was ordered to pacify the rebellion. That night, when the first shell exploded on the Tibetan army's position on Yaowang Mountain, La Ru could not sleep. He kept calling the Tibetan Military Region Command, hoping to stand on the right side at the critical moment. But it was too late, the phone could not be connected. At this time, he thought of fleeing. The servant had prepared the horse and packed the luggage. But his wife, who was about to give birth, and his two young children made him hesitate. It was difficult to escape with a family, and leaving them behind was like passing the disaster on to them, and his sins would be deeper. He chose to surrender, while hoping that the People's Liberation Army would treat the prisoners leniently.

After that, he spent 6 years in prison and reform through labor. The People's Liberation Army did not mistreat him. He still remembers when the democratic reform came, he was brought to the historical trial platform. "At that time, seeing the angry crowd surging like a tide, I thought: this is the end. But the People's Liberation Army blocked the crowd's saliva and fists, protecting me."

The life of reform through labor was hard and compulsory. In private, he regretted and was discouraged. If he had fled to a foreign country at that time, with his abilities and wealth, he would have made a name for himself by now. But two things gave him hope. One was the policy of "giving a way out" propagated by the prison guards, and the other was studying Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance. He thought, why can't I change my fate with my own hands?

After that, his fellow prisoners thought he was strange, working hard and singing songs. He said, the policy of the Communist Party had reformed him. He became a model of reform, receiving awards every year. In 1965, he was released and found a job in the suburban countryside. In 1977, he was elected as a member of the Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference and a member of the National Political Consultative Conference. In 1983, he was elected as Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference.

On the 30th anniversary of the pacification of Tibet and democratic reform, La Ru·Qíwàngduōjí told the reporter: History has proven that my later choice was correct. When he heard that many of his former colleagues in the Kashag had become wanderers overseas, longing to return but unable to, he felt even more fortunate that his family could be together in the great family of the motherland.

　　西藏平叛前后        
    ——访前藏军司令拉鲁·次旺多吉
    本报记者  卢小飞
    今年３月１０日，是西藏反动上层分子发动武装叛乱３０周年；而３月２０日，则是中共西藏工委会和西藏军区奉命平息西藏叛乱３０周年。这两个日子，以及３０年前发生的一切，使现西藏政协副主席、前藏军司令拉鲁·次旺多吉感慨万千。面对记者的采访，他回忆了这一非常事件的前前后后。
    那是一个多风的３月，噶厦（原西藏地方政府）三品俗官拉鲁·次旺多吉尚没有意识到自己正处于人生的三岔路口。噶厦政府器重他，共产党、解放军对他也不错。
    事件始于达赖喇嘛要到军区看戏。那时候，达赖喇嘛与军区首长们的关系已经相当不错。听说军区文工团从内地引进新的节目，达赖喇嘛极有兴致，文工团也曾到布达拉宫为达赖喇嘛专场演出，但有些大型的剧目需要复杂的灯光布景，于是达赖喇嘛向军区副司令员邓少东和工委秘书长郭锡兰提出去军区看演出，并择定藏历２月初一，即３月１０日这一吉日。
    拉鲁说：那时我常去军区，我记得很清楚，那出戏叫《红霞》。
    然而，这天早晨，有人放出了谣言：“军区要假借看戏劫持达赖喇嘛。”谣言在拉萨城不胫而走。笃信佛教、崇尚达赖喇嘛的信徒们听此谣言，蜂一般拥向罗布林卡（达赖喇嘛夏宫），希图阻止达赖到军区看戏。
    谣言是罗布林卡的一名下级僧官丹玛觉放出来的。这是拉鲁在参叛入狱后听同室的次丹平措说的。次丹平措是伪人民代表会成员，了解不少内幕，后来死在狱中。
    拉鲁以为这谣言不可信。但他也深知，那些百姓们容易听信谣言。“历史与现实总有许多相似之处。”说到这，他插了一句。拉萨最近发生的几次骚乱也都有谣言的背景，造谣者常常利用信徒对达赖喇嘛的感情，挑拨是非，很多人上当受骗，一哄而起之后就越发不可收拾。１９５９年３月１０日那天正是这样，暴怒的人群在罗布林卡门口打死了爱国僧官堪穷索朗降措，将尸体绑在马后狂奔示众，有人嗷叫：这就是靠近共产党的下场。这场面使暴乱持续升级，更多的人被裹挟进来。这正是预谋者所期待的，他们已经磨刀霍霍了。
    ３７岁的三品官拉鲁还来不及对历史做出选择的时候，历史便先选择了他。３月１１日，他接到赴罗布林卡开紧急会议的命令。这次会上，仲译钦波们亮出了“西藏独立”的招牌，主讲人是正秘书长觉顶·土登诺桑。其实“独立”已不是什么新鲜玩意。西藏历史上“独立”和反“独立”的斗争曾有过多次。但这回，“独立”派摆出了恶战的架式，所谓的正规军都已集结部署，来自康巴等地的杂牌民团也杀气腾腾。拉鲁此时也跃跃欲试，他用西藏谚语“取蛋而鸡不惊”来阐述了自己的作战方案，获得些许叫好声。
    ３月１２日，他去布达拉宫“雪”地开会，就在这次会上，他被选为藏军总司令，同时还有两僧两俗四位四品官被选为副司令。这有些出乎意料，或许众官员看中他能文能武，或许是前一天的演说颇显指挥才能。他来不及想什么了。
    拉鲁说，就其本意来讲，他希望缓和。昌都一役，他已深知解放军的厉害。但事已至此，只有背水一战。走马上任的第一件事是清点参战人员的花名册，继而去视察阵地。而后，他又过问了寺庙的武力装备及寺庙后门的兵力部署，过问了重要渡口的守备。整整忙乎了一天，工作效率不可谓不高。
    然而拉鲁却是个短命司令。因为内讧，有人不服他，他的前任也不愿挪开地方，１３日下午，在一场闹哄哄的会上，他的司令让人“下”了。
    以后的事情，先是达赖受人怂恿于３月１７日深夜出逃，再就是３月２０日解放军奉命平息叛乱。那天夜里，当第一颗炮弹炸响在药王山藏军阵地时，拉鲁再也睡不着了。他不停地往西藏军区司令部摇着电话，希望能在关键时刻站过去。但为时晚矣，电话怎么也打不通。这时，他想到出逃。仆人备好了马，打点了盘缠。可是，眼前就要分娩的妻子和膝下一对小儿女使他迟疑了。拉家带口的难以脱身，而留下他们等于把灾祸转嫁给他们，自己的罪孽将更深。他选择了束手就擒，同时期待解放军能宽待俘虏。
    接着，便是６年的监改生活，解放军果然没有虐待过他。他还记得民主改革到来的时候，他被带到历史的审判台上，“当时，看到愤怒的群众潮水般涌过来，我想：这下完了。可是，解放军挡住了群众的口水和拳头，保护了我。”
    劳改生活是艰苦的，是强制性的。私下里，他后悔过、沮丧过，如果那时候跑到国外，凭自己的本事和财力，早混出个样子了。但有两件事又给他带来希望。一件是管教员宣传“给出路”的政策，一件是学习毛主席关于自力更生的学说。他想，我为什么不能凭双手改变自己的命运？
    这以后，同案人都觉得他有些奇怪，卖劲地干活，还唱着歌。他说，共产党的政策感化了我。他当上了改造模范，年年得奖状。１９６５年他获释了，就业于郊区农村。１９７７年他先后当选为自治区政协常委、全国政协委员。１９８３年又当选为自治区政协副主席。
    时值西藏平叛、民主改革３０周年，拉鲁·次旺多吉对记者说：历史证明我后来的选择是对的。当他听说许多当年在噶厦共事过的老臣飘零海外、欲归而不能时，更感到全家人能够团聚在祖国大家庭里是多么幸福。
