Chen Mingshan, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said this afternoon at the second session of the seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that to carry out rectification and deepen reform, we must cherish, consolidate, and develop a stable, united, democratic, and harmonious political situation.

Chen Mingshan said, a stable, united, democratic, and harmonious political situation is the inevitable result of our ten years of reform and opening up, and it is also an important guarantee for deepening reform and achieving the grand goal of socialist modernization construction. The core of stability, unity, democracy, and harmony is democracy. As socialist democracy continues to improve, stability, unity, and harmony will have a foundation.

He emphasized that it must be clearly pointed out that the democracy we are talking about can only be socialist democracy, not Western-style democracy. Some people insist on complete Westernization and completely copying the Western model. I think this does not suit China's national conditions. Because we are pursuing a planned commodity economy, not a privatized free economy, and politically, we are also adhering to democratic politics under the four cardinal principles, not Western liberalization. Building socialism requires democracy, and only by fully carrying forward socialist democracy can our modernization be possible. However, democratization and liberalization are two different things. I support political democratization but not Western liberalization; I support the multi-party cooperation system led by the Communist Party of China, not the opposition party. This is the conclusion we draw from China's specific reality. If we deviate from China's national conditions and copy Western democracy, it will only create a chaotic situation and make the country unstable.

Chen Mingshan said, after more than a hundred years of relentless struggle, the Chinese people have finally built a powerful new China under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. We must walk our own path. We do not want to experience the chaos and weakness of the past. Therefore, I sincerely hope that our country will have a stable political situation of stability, unity, democracy, and harmony, so that we can manage the economic environment and economic order in a stable social and political environment, and at the same time, deepen the reform of the political system and economic system, laying the foundation for the prosperity, strength, and improvement of people's lives in a country with more than a billion people.

He said, we must also see that there are many problems and difficulties at present. We should face up to the difficulties and problems. It is good to be concerned about the country and the people, and to be a frank friend, but more importantly, we should unite as one and contribute to the country with the attitude of a master of the country, to help the country solve its worries and difficulties. It can be said that the situation is severe, but our confidence is sufficient.

As for some foreign forces that point fingers and create various opinions to interfere in our domestic affairs, disrupt our thoughts, and hope for chaos, this is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people, and I firmly oppose it.

　　陈铭珊委员在政协七届二次会议上发言        
    珍惜安定团结民主和谐政治局面
    新华社北京３月２５日电  全国政协委员、民建中央副主席陈铭珊今天下午在全国政协七届二次会议举行的大会上说，搞好治理整顿和深化改革，必须珍惜、巩固和发展安定团结、民主和谐政治局面。
    陈铭珊说，安定团结、民主和谐的政治局面是我们十年改革、开放的必然结果，也是今后深化改革和实现社会主义现代化建设宏伟目标的重要保证。安定团结、民主和谐，核心是民主。社会主义民主不断完善了，安定、团结、和谐就有了基础。
    他强调说，必须明白地指出，我们所说的民主，只能是社会主义的民主，而不能是西方式的民主。有些人坚持要全盘西化，完全照搬西方模式，我认为这不符合我国国情。因为我们要搞的是有计划的商品经济，不是私有化的自由经济，政治上也是坚持四项基本原则下的民主政治，不是西方的自由化。建设社会主义，民主是不可缺少的，只有充分发扬社会主义民主，我们的现代化才有可能。但是民主化与自由化是两回事。我赞成政治上的民主化，而不赞成西方的自由化；我赞成中国共产党领导的多党合作制，不赞成搞反对党。这是我们从中国的具体实际出发得出的结论，离开了中国国情，照搬西方的民主，只能造成混乱不堪的局面，会使国无宁日的。
    陈铭珊说，我国人民经过百多年的前仆后继的奋斗，总算在中国共产党领导下，建设了一个强大的新中国，我们要走自己的道路，过去混乱、贫弱的种种苦果，我们再也不愿尝它了。所以，我衷心希望我们的国家有安定团结、民主和谐这样一个稳定的局面，让我们能够在一个稳定的社会政治环境中把经济环境治理好，把经济秩序整顿好，同时把政治体制和经济体制的改革推向深入，为我们这样一个十亿多人口的国家的繁荣、富强和人民生活的提高，打下基础。
    他说，我们还应当看到，现在存在的问题和困难很多，我们要正视困难和问题。忧国忧民、敢做诤友是好的，但更重要的是同心同德，以国家主人翁的态度献计出力，为国家排忧解难。应当说，形势是严峻的，但我们的信心是充足的。
    至于有一些外国势力，指手划脚，制造种种舆论干涉我国内政，搞乱我们的思想，唯恐天下不乱，这是我国人民绝对不能容忍的，我坚决表示反对。
