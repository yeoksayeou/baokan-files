The third plenary session of the Seventh National People's Congress was held this morning in the Great Hall of the People, where explanations were given regarding relevant draft laws and proposals, as well as the work report of the Standing Committee.

The session was presided over by the chairman of the presidium, Rè Jiéqióng.

The session heard Wang Hànbīn, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and director of the Legislative Affairs Commission, explain the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law of the People's Republic of China and the draft of the Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress.

Wang Hànbīn said that the formulation of the Administrative Litigation Law is of great significance in implementing the Constitution and the principles proposed by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China to protect citizens' legal rights, in maintaining and promoting the lawful exercise of administrative powers by administrative organs, and in improving and enhancing administrative work.

Regarding the draft of the Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress, Wang Hànbīn said that the formulation of the rules of procedure is aimed at strengthening the institutional and legal construction of the work of the National People's Congress, so as to facilitate the National People's Congress to exercise its powers in accordance with democratic and legal procedures.

Premier Li Peng submitted a proposal to this session of the National People's Congress on behalf of the State Council, requesting authorization for the People's Congress and its Standing Committee of Shenzhen Municipality, as well as the People's Government of Shenzhen Municipality, to formulate separately the laws and regulations of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. At today's session, Luó Gàn, secretary-general of the State Council, made an explanation on this proposal on behalf of the State Council.

The session also heard Peng Chōng, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, deliver the work report of the Standing Committee.

He said that since the First Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the Standing Committee has achieved certain results in its work. However, there is still a gap between the work and the requirements of the Constitution and the expectations of the people. There are still many shortcomings and problems in the work. Legislative work does not meet the requirements of reform and construction, and it is necessary to further accelerate the pace of legislation; how to further proceduralize and institutionalize supervision work still needs to be summarized and improved in practice; the Standing Committee also needs to strengthen its contact with the deputies to the National People's Congress and the Standing Committees of local people's congresses.

The following also served as chairpersons of the session today: Jǔ Xuérán, Róng Yìrén, Yè Fēi, Mǎ Sīzhōng, Bātùbāgēn, Gān Kǔ, Xǔ Qín, Sūn Wéiběn, Lǐ Xīpǔ, Wú Zhèn, Shěn Zǔlún, Zhāng Yùhuán, Hóng Xuézhi.

　　人大会议举行第三次大会        
    听取有关法律草案、议案说明和常委会工作报告
    据新华社北京３月２８日电  （记者何平）七届全国人大二次会议今天上午在人民大会堂举行第三次大会，听取有关法律草案、议案的说明。
    大会执行主席、主席团常务主席雷洁琼主持了会议。
    会议听取了全国人大常委会副委员长、法制工作委员会主任王汉斌作的关于中华人民共和国行政诉讼法草案的说明、关于中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会议事规则草案的说明。
    王汉斌说，行政诉讼法的制定，对于贯彻执行宪法和党的十三大报告提出的保障公民合法权益的原则，对于维护和促进行政机关依法行使行政职权，改进和提高行政工作，都有重要的积极的意义。
    关于全国人大议事规则草案，王汉斌说，制定议事规则是为了加强全国人大工作的制度化、法律化建设，便于全国人大依照民主的、法定的程序行使职权。
    国务院总理李鹏向这次人代会提交了国务院关于提请授权深圳市人民代表大会及其常委会和深圳市人民政府分别制定深圳经济特区法规、规章的议案。在今天的大会上，国务院秘书长罗干受国务院委托，就这个议案作了说明。
    会议还听取了全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲作的全国人大常委会工作报告。
    他说，七届全国人大一次会议以来，常委会的工作取得了一定的成绩。但是，离宪法的要求和人民的期望还有差距，工作中还存在不少缺点和问题。立法工作还不适应改革和建设的要求，需要进一步加快立法步伐；监督工作如何进一步做到程序化、制度化，还需要在实践中继续总结经验，加以改进；常委会在同全国人大代表和地方人大常委会联系方面，也还做得不够，需要进一步加强。
    今天担任大会执行主席的还有：朱学范、荣毅仁、叶飞、马思忠、巴图巴根、甘苦、许勤、孙维本、李溪溥、吴振、沈祖伦、张玉环、洪学智。
