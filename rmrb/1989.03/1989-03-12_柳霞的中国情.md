Her eyes were very blue, with a mix of firmness and a hint of sadness, making her unforgettable.

"You must have been very beautiful when you were young," I said.

She smiled slightly and replied, "Young people are always beautiful."

Her name is Liu Xia, an ordinary Soviet woman.

Last summer, I received a notice that I would be going to Leningrad State University's Department of Oriental Studies to teach. Soon after, I heard that a teacher from the same department was visiting Beijing. She would be my future colleague, so I invited her to my home for dinner. During the meal, I noticed she used chopsticks very well. Upon inquiring, I learned that she had lived in China in the 1950s, married a Chinese man, and had a daughter. Her daughter was just two years old when her husband tragically passed away. In the early 1960s, she had to return to her home country alone with her daughter. She spoke calmly, showing no particular sadness, but when she mentioned passing by her old residence on Guli Street, her eyes showed a sense of desolation.

In mid-September, when I went to the Soviet Union, I coincidentally ended up on the same train as Liu Xia. Naturally, we were very happy. I asked her what she bought in Beijing, and she said she mainly bought clothes for her daughter.

"Why didn't you bring your daughter with you?" I asked.

"She really wanted to come. This time, I mainly came to see my husband's family. They all live in the countryside. More than ten of them came to Beijing to see me. Unfortunately, my in-laws and my husband's generation have all passed away. The ones who came are all younger relatives. Some call me Auntie, and some call me Big Sister. They said, 'Little Nightingale is one of our Northern family. We have always been thinking of her. Life was tough in the past few years, but now it's better. When our lives improve a bit more, we will definitely invite Little Nightingale to come back to her hometown in China to see the mountains and rivers.'" Her eyes sparkled as she spoke.

"Your daughter is named Little Nightingale?"

"Yes, her father named her."

She then pulled out a bag from under her bed and took out a box. Opening layer after layer of paper, a vibrant, juicy-looking stone peach appeared in Liu Xia's hand. She seemed very excited, her face flushed, and said, "This is a gift from my nephews. They said it's for my daughter, their Little Nightingale. They said the village has started a stone factory, and this is something they made with their own hands." After saying this, she carefully wrapped the peach back in paper and put it away.

Soon after arriving in Leningrad, I started teaching. The courses were numerous and quite busy. But whenever there was free time, Liu Xia would always act as a good host, accompanying me on the streets and alleviating my loneliness in a foreign land.

In the second month after my arrival, one day after receiving my salary and returning home, I went to the store to buy something. Suddenly, I realized that my salary and wallet had disappeared. The Soviet colleagues in the research office were very worried, knowing that a guest had just arrived and lost money. Although I felt frustrated, I still comforted them, saying that this kind of thing happens in any country. Soviet experts in China also have things stolen.

A few days later, Liu Xia happily came to my home, saying that the school had supplemented some of my money. She didn't give it to me at school because she was afraid something might happen on the way, so she personally delivered it.

The more I got to know Liu Xia, the more I understood her. After graduating from the Department of Oriental Studies at Leningrad State University in the 1950s, she was sent to work in China, initially as a translator in the Ministry of Railways. Her husband was a student at the Shanghai Institute of Physical Education before liberation, a member of the underground Communist Party. After liberation, he participated in the "Resistance Against America and Aid to Korea" and later became a department head in the Ministry of Railways. They met and got married during their work. Later, due to the construction of a railway to a certain test site in the northwest, her husband led a team to survey the area, got injured on the job, and returned home three months later. He passed away, leaving their daughter, who was only two years old at the time. She said, "He died tragically, and I will never forget it. Before he died, he entrusted me to take good care of the child." As she spoke, a layer of mist covered her deep blue eyes. I quickly changed the subject.

I knew that Liu Xia deeply loved her husband. After being forced to return to the Soviet Union with her daughter in the early 1960s, she never remarried. Now, her daughter has grown up and become an architectural designer. She did not go against her Chinese husband's wishes.

On the first day of the Lunar New Year, I was flipping through a photo album I brought with me, imagining how my family in Beijing was celebrating the New Year, eating dumplings, and setting off firecrackers. Suddenly, the doorbell rang. When I opened the door, it was Liu Xia! Her first words were, "Happy New Year, I'm here to wish you a happy New Year!" Then she tightly hugged me, wishing me all the best.

I made her a cup of tea. Liu Xia sipped the tea and took out a paper bag tied with a red string from her bag, smiling and saying, "This is my New Year's gift to you."

I quickly opened it. Wow! It was a bright red waistband!

As a lone traveler in a foreign land, I only then realized that I was born in the Year of the Snake, and this year was my zodiac year.

I don't remember when I told Liu Xia my age, and it's even stranger that she still remembers this Chinese custom.

Liu Xia left.

I held the waistband in my hands, my thoughts surging. In my life, I have received two red waistbands. One was when I was 12 years old, given to me by my mother. She carefully tied it around my waist, as if pouring all her love into it, blessing me with a year of safety and peace.

The second one is this one. I feel that it embodies Liu Xia's love for China, connecting the hearts of the Chinese and Soviet peoples.

Isn't it true? No matter how many hardships we face, just as the lands of China and the Soviet Union are closely connected, the hearts of the Chinese and Soviet peoples are always in harmony, always connected.

### 柳霞的中国情

　　柳霞的中国情
    刘镰力
    她的眼睛很蓝，刚毅中带点忧郁，让人一见难忘。
    “你年轻时一定很好看。”我说。
    她笑了笑说：“年轻人总是美的。”
    她叫柳霞，一个普通的苏联妇女。
    去年夏天，我得到通知，将赴苏联列宁格勒大学东方系任教。不久，又听说该校一位东方系教师正在京旅游，那是将来的同事，于是我请她来家吃饭。席间，我见她筷子用得极好，一打听，才知她５０年代曾生活在中国，嫁与一中国人，并生一女孩儿，女儿刚刚两岁，丈夫不幸病逝，６０年代初，她只好孤身携女回国。说时淡淡，不见什么特别的悲伤，只是提到她某天曾打礼士路旧居前经过时，眼中透出苍凉。
    ９月中旬我去苏联时，竟又与柳霞同车，大家自是格外高兴。我问她在北京买了点什么，她说主要是给女儿买些衣服。
    “为什么不带女儿一起来？”我问。
    “她很想来。我这次来主要是想看看我丈夫家里的人。他们都住在农村，知道我来了，１０多个人到北京来看我。遗憾的是公婆和我丈夫那一辈的人都去世了，来的都是晚辈，有的叫我婶子，有的叫我大娘。他们说：‘北莺妹妹是我们北家的人，我们一直记挂着她。前些年日子过得苦，没办法，现在好了。等我们日子再好一点，一定邀请莺妹妹回中国老家住些日子，认认家乡的山和水。’”她说时，眼睛很亮。
    “你女儿叫北莺？”
    “是。她爸爸起的。”
    她说着从床位下面拉出一个提包，从里面拿出一个盒子。打开一层层棉纸，一只鲜艳欲滴的大理石水蜜桃展现在柳霞的手掌上。她好象很兴奋，脸都红了，说：“这是侄儿们送的，说是让我带给我的女儿——他们的北莺妹妹。他们说村子里办起了大理石厂，这是他们亲手做的。”说完，她又用棉纸把桃子一层层包好，珍重地收了起来。
    到列宁格勒不久，就开始上课了，课程较多，也比较忙。但只要有空，柳霞必尽地主之谊，陪我上街，解我一人居住异国他乡之孤寂。
    来后第二个月，那天领了工资回家。我顺路去商店买东西，忽然发现工资连同钱包全不翼而飞。教研室的苏联同志知道了都很不安，客人刚来就丢钱。我虽觉懊丧，但还是安慰大家说，这是哪个国家都有的事，苏联专家在中国，也有丢东西的。
    不久后的一天，柳霞高兴地来到我家里，说学校补助我一部分钱，在学校时她没有给我，是怕我在路上再出事，所以亲自送来。
    和柳霞接触多了，对她也更了解了。她５０年代在列宁格勒大学东方系毕业后，被派到中国工作，开始在铁道部当翻译。她丈夫解放前是上海体院的学生，地下党员，解放后曾参加“抗美援朝”，后来在铁道部当局长，工作中他们相识并结了婚。后来因修筑通往西北某试验场地的铁路，她丈夫带人前去勘察，因公负伤，回来后三个月就去世了，当时女儿才两岁。她说：“他死得很惨，我一辈子也忘不了。临终前，他嘱咐我要带好孩子。”说时，深蓝的眼里蒙上了一层迷雾。我连忙用话岔开。
    我知道，柳霞深深地爱着她的丈夫。在她迫不得已于６０年代初携女回苏联定居后，一直没有再婚。现在，她的女儿已经长大，成了一名建筑设计师。她没有违背中国丈夫的嘱托。
    大年初一，我正在翻看带来的相册，想象着北京的家人在怎样过节，吃饺子，放鞭炮。突然门铃响了，开门一看，原来是柳霞！她的第一句话就是：“春节好，给你拜年！”然后紧紧地拥抱了我，祝我万事如意。
    我给她泡了一杯茶。柳霞喝着茶，从包里拿出一个用红丝条系着的纸袋，笑着说：“这是我送给你的春节礼物。”
    我连忙打开，天！原来是一条火红火红的红腰带！
    孤身一人身处异国他乡的我，直到此时才忽然悟到自己原来属蛇，今年是我的本命年。
    我记不清自己在什么时候向柳霞吐露过年龄，更奇怪她怎么到现在还记得中国的这个习俗。
    柳霞走了。
    我手捧腰带，思潮起伏。我生平得过两条红腰带，一条是１２岁那年，母亲给的。她珍重地替我系在腰间，仿佛倾注着全部的母爱，保佑我一年平平安安。
    第二条就是这一条了。我觉得它体现了柳霞的中国情，连着中苏人民的心。
    不是吗？不管经历多少磨难，正像中苏两国的大地紧紧相连一样，中苏两国人民的心，始终是相通的，是连在一起的。
