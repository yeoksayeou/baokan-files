Title: Eliminate Internal Friction and Strengthen Unity – On Harnessing the Collective Advantages of Leadership Teams

Zhao Ziyang, during an inspection tour last year, pointed out: "Engaging in internal friction does not align with the tide of the times or the interests of the people. The more internal friction there is, the more backward one becomes, and no one benefits. He emphasized, "We must create public opinion to strengthen unity and overcome internal friction."

To implement Zhao Ziyang's instructions, we, based on the realities of Jiangxi, have called for the following practices among all levels and departments of leadership teams across the province:

Everyone should think about the overall situation, focus on major issues, and concentrate on work rather than personal fame, position, or power. All leadership members should be dedicated to the cause of the Party and the people. This is the most important ideological foundation for strengthening unity. Currently, in some leadership teams, a few comrades think more about personal gains and losses rather than the overall situation. They do not seek achievements and contributions in their work but rather focus on personal reputation and status. Some even demand positions and power, and if their demands are not met, they complain, talk nonsense, harbor grudges, and even work passively or stir up trouble. To solve this problem, the most fundamental approach is to strengthen party spirit education within the team and strictly require leadership members to be models of serving the people wholeheartedly. At the same time, by implementing goal management and position responsibility systems, we can guide everyone's thoughts and energy towards the Party's cause and the goals of reform and construction in their respective regions and departments.

We should use outstanding performance as the standard for evaluating people, use democratic and open methods for selecting personnel, and be fair and impartial, drawing from a wide pool of talent, and selecting the best. The issue of personnel selection is highly sensitive and complex, and many conflicts within teams arise from disagreements over personnel selection. In the future, when selecting and appointing cadres, we should pay special attention to two principles: one is to adhere to the "four modernizations" policy, evaluating cadres based on their performance and abilities; the other is to adhere to the mass line, using democratic evaluations and open selection methods to increase openness, transparency, and accuracy. With these two principles, we can ensure that those who are truly capable and willing to work hard are recognized, and the most outstanding among them are selected. For those with outstanding performance, we should look at the main aspects and major principles, not demanding perfection. Especially for those who dare to reform but have made some mistakes, we should pay attention to protecting them. This will help create an environment where talents emerge and the capable compete.

Everyone should have a broad mind, think ahead, and look forward, transcending historical personal grievances. Historical issues should be dealt with broadly rather than narrowly. All levels of leadership team members should understand the bigger picture, uphold party spirit, not dwell on old grievances, set aside past differences, and work together for the "four modernizations." As a central leader said during an inspection in Jiangxi: "Throw all those non-principled issues into the Ganjiang and Yangtze Rivers. The Ganjiang and Yangtze Rivers can hold anything."

For major issues, we should dare to uphold principles, while for minor issues and small faults, we should be tolerant and forgiving, "accepting others' shortcomings and taking their strengths." Some teams are not very united, often due to trivial matters that harm harmony, or disagreements on major principles. In my view, for the sake of unity and the cause, leaders must be open-minded, magnanimous, flexible yet firm. For matters that affect the overall situation, we must dare to uphold principles and speak the truth without regard for personal relationships. Because unity without principles is not true unity; at the same time, we should be able to "be clear on major issues and vague on minor ones," "accept others' shortcomings and take their strengths," and be forgiving even when in the right on minor issues. This is very important for overcoming internal friction and strengthening unity.

We should be sincere with each other, speak openly, and "each do more self-criticism." All units that have good unity share a common experience: they emphasize a healthy democratic life within the team and regularly conduct criticism and self-criticism. Leadership members should frequently communicate their thoughts, share their hearts, and keep each other informed. When there are problems, they should address them promptly and openly discuss their views, rather than saying one thing to the face and another behind the back. They should not reveal internal differences to the outside or listen to societal gossip and rumors. During criticism and self-criticism, we should advocate for being strict with oneself and lenient with others, and each do more self-criticism. When problems arise in work, one should take responsibility. We should be good at listening to different opinions, even those that oppose our own.

Currently, our Party is in a new historical period of transformation, with a heavy responsibility and a long way to go. All levels of Party organizations and leaders must adapt to the requirements of the times, prioritize the Party's cause and the people's interests, and cherish and maintain unity within the team.

### 消除内耗　增强合力——谈发挥领导班子的群体优势

　　消除内耗　增强合力
    ——谈发挥领导班子的群体优势
    中共江西省委书记  毛致用
    紫阳同志去年在外地视察时指出：“搞内耗，不符合时代潮流，不符合人民的利益。越搞内耗越落后，谁也占不了便宜。”并强调“要为加强团结，克服内耗造舆论。”
    为了落实紫阳同志的这个意见，我们从江西的实际出发，要求全省各级各部门的领导班子进一步倡导这样几种风气：
    大家都来想全局，抓大事，用心琢磨工作而不琢磨个人名、位、权。所有领导成员专注于党和人民的事业，这是增强团结最重要的思想基础。现在，在各级领导班子中，有极少数同志想全局的大事少，想个人的利益得失多，不在工作上求政绩，争贡献，而喜欢计较和攀比个人的名誉地位，有的甚至伸手要官，伸手要权，达不到要求，满足不了私欲，便发牢骚，讲怪话，埋三怨四，以至消极怠工和拨弄是非。解决这个问题，最根本的还是要抓紧班子内部的党性教育，严格要求领导成员做全心全意为人民服务的模范。同时，要通过落实目标管理和岗位责任制，把大家的心思和精力都引导到党的事业上来，引导到实现本地本部门改革和建设的目标上来。
    用突出政绩的标准看人，用民主公开的方法选人，公道正派，五湖四海，唯贤是举。用人是一个十分敏感、复杂的问题，班子中发生的矛盾有不少是源于用人上的意见分歧。今后我们选拔和使用干部，要特别注意两条：一条是坚持干部“四化”方针，按照统一的标准，“从政绩中看德才，从实践中分优劣”；另一条是坚持群众路线，通过民主考评、公开选拔等办法，增强开放度、透明度、准确度。有了这两条，就可以让那些真正有本事、肯干事的人香起来，把其中干得最出色的人选上来。对政绩突出的人，要看主流，看大节，不求全责备。特别是对其中勇于改革但有某些失误的同志要注意保护。这样有利于形成一个人才群起、贤能竞飞的局面。
    大家都用宽宏博大的胸怀往前想，向前看，从历史上那些个人的恩恩怨怨中超脱出来。历史问题宜粗不宜细。各级领导班子成员都要识大体，讲党性，不纠缠历史旧帐，抛弃前嫌，共图“四化”大业，正像中央一位领导同志来江西视察时说的：“把那些不是原则的问题统统甩到赣江、长江里去。赣江、长江有多少东西都装得下。”
    对大的问题敢于坚持原则、对小是小非小毛病互相谅解，“容人之短，取人之长”。有的班子不那么团结，往往是一些鸡毛蒜皮的小事伤了和气，当然也有的是在大的原则问题上存在意见分歧。我看，对领导干部来说，为了团结，为了事业，一定要虚怀若谷，豁达大度，柔中有刚，刚中有柔。对攸关全局的大事，要敢于坚持原则，讲真理，不讲情面。因为没有原则的团结，不是真正的团结；同时又应该做到“大事清楚，小事糊涂”，“容人之短，取人之长”，在小是小非问题上有理也饶人，这对克服内耗、加强团结是十分重要的。
    以诚相见，有话当面说，“各自多作自我批评”。凡是团结搞得好的单位，有一条共同经验，就是注重健全班子内部的民主生活，经常开展批评和自我批评。领导成员之间应当经常沟通思想，多交心，多通气，有问题及时打招呼，开诚布公地将意见摆到桌面上来，而不要当面不说背后说，不要把班子内部的某些不同看法捅到外面去，更不要听信社会上的闲言碎语，流言蜚语。在开展批评和自我批评时，要提倡严于责己，宽以待人，各自多作自我批评。工作中出了问题，要主动承担责任。要善于听取不同的意见，甚至是反对自己的意见。
    目前我们党正处在历史性转变的新时期，任重而道远。各级党组织和各级各部门的领导同志，一定要适应时代要求，坚持以党的事业为重，以人民的利益为重，珍惜和维护班子内部的团结。
