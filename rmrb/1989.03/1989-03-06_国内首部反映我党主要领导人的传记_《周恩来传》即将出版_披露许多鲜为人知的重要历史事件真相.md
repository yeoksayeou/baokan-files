On the occasion of the 91st anniversary of Zhou Enlai's birth, the People's Publishing House and the Central Documents Publishing House are jointly publishing "Biography of Zhou Enlai (1898-1949)." This is a major political biography of the thoughts and life of a major leader of the Communist Party of China, compiled by the Central Party Literature Research Office after many years of effort. The book is approximately 600,000 words in length.

This biography extensively utilizes a large amount of first-hand materials, including: Zhou Enlai's manuscripts, letters, telegrams, speech outlines, and his diaries and compositions from his youth; records of meetings of the Political Bureau and Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and records of meetings of the Yangtze River Bureau and the South Bureau during the War of Resistance Against Japan; records of the Political Affairs Meeting of the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government, and records of negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party; various periodicals of the time, as well as diaries, memoirs, and interview records of people who had direct contact with Zhou Enlai. Most of these materials have not been published until now. The book also references books and materials published in Taiwan, the Soviet Union, the United States, and other places, and absorbs the latest research results from domestic and foreign theoretical and historical circles. The book includes 33 photographs, 7 maps, and 11 illustrations of Zhou Enlai's handwriting.

This biography truthfully narrates Zhou Enlai's tortuous process of seeking truth and establishing faith during the democratic revolution period, reflects his tenacious exploration and great contributions to the Chinese revolution under extremely difficult conditions at various major historical turning points, and showcases his virtues of considering the overall situation, tolerating for the party, being upright and open, and connecting with the masses, as well as his character and multifaceted talents. At the same time, it objectively and specifically describes and analyzes some of his mistakes in complex historical environments. The book reveals many important historical events that were previously little known, clarifies some misunderstandings that have circulated in society, and vividly depicts important details of many major historical events that Zhou Enlai participated in handling since he became a major leader of the Central Committee of the Communist Party. Reading this book not only helps readers understand Zhou Enlai's life but also provides a glimpse into modern Chinese history and the history of the Communist Party of China from one angle.
