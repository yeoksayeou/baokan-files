The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa recently predicted that Africa's economic situation may ease somewhat in 1989, but the outlook is not optimistic.

According to this United Nations organization's investigation, the average economic growth rate of African countries in 1988 was 2.5%, the same as in 1987. Due to the heavy rains in Africa last year, agricultural production increased by about 3.8%.

The population growth rate in Africa is as high as 3%, with a rapid population explosion, while the African economy is only developing at a low speed, unable to fundamentally change the poverty situation on the African continent.

The increasingly severe debt problem is the main obstacle to Africa's development. The total external debt has reached $230 billion. African countries' annual debt repayment and interest payments account for more than 40% of their total exports. Although Western developed countries have taken measures such as forgiving part of the debt, extending the debt repayment period, and providing new aid, the African debt crisis has not shown any signs of easing.

In 1988, Africa's grain production showed a pleasing improvement, with a growth rate of 7.8% and a total output of 71.8 million tons. Only Sudan, northern Ethiopia, Angola, and Mozambique still face famine, due to either years of civil war, the lingering effects of the 1987 drought, or a combination of natural and man-made disasters.

Meanwhile, Africa's exports of mineral and agricultural products are still affected by the sharp drop in commodity prices in the early 1980s. The export earnings of sub-Saharan African countries decreased by 50% from 1980 to 1987, resulting in a loss of $24 billion.

According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa's forecast, the prices of most mineral and agricultural raw materials in the world will show a downward trend this year. Even if Africa's overall economic difficulties ease slightly, it will not be very optimistic.

People hope that the economic recovery plans implemented by most African countries will play a more positive role.

### 联合国非洲经委会最近预测  今年非洲经济将略有改善

　　联合国非洲经委会最近预测
    今年非洲经济将略有改善
    本报开罗３月７日电  记者林皎明报道：总部设在亚的斯亚贝巴的联合国非洲经济委员会最近预测，１９８９年非洲经济形势的困境可能会有所缓解，但并不乐观。
    据这个联合国组织调查表明，非洲各国１９８８年经济增长率平均在２．５％，与１９８７年持平。由于去年非洲普降雨水，农业生产增长３．８％左右。
    非洲大陆的人口增长率高达３％，人口急剧膨胀，而非洲经济只在低速发展，无法根本改变非洲大陆的贫穷状况。
    日益严重的债务问题是非洲发展的主要障碍，外债总额已达２３００亿美元。非洲国家每年还本付息额高达全部出口额的４０％多。尽管西方先进国家采取勾销部分债款、延长债务偿还期、提供新援助等措施，但非洲债务危机仍没有任何缓解。
    非洲大陆１９８８年粮食生产有可喜改观，增长率达７．８％，总产量为７１８０万吨。只有苏丹、埃塞俄比亚北部地区、安哥拉、莫桑比克仍面临饥荒，其原因或由于连年内战，或由于仍受１９８７年旱灾影响，或由于天灾人祸兼而有之。
    与此同时，非洲矿产和农产品出口至今还在受８０年代初原料价格暴跌的影响。撒哈拉沙漠以南各国的出口额１９８０至１９８７年间下降５０％，损失达２４０亿美元。
    据联合国非洲经济委员会预测，今年世界多数矿产原料和其它农业品原料行情有下降趋势，非洲总的经济困境即使稍有缓解，也不能太乐观。
    人们期望，大多数非洲国家执行的经济复兴计划能进一步发挥积极作用。
