The "Federal Ethics Reform Commission" appointed by President Bush today released its final report, proposing an anti-corruption reform plan. The report puts forward 27 reform suggestions for ethics regulations, including prohibiting civil servants from receiving remuneration, revising administrative regulations on political ethics, and preventing former officials from engaging in lobbying activities or using "non-public information" to seek personal gain within a certain period after leaving office.

The reform commission consists of 8 individuals who have previously held public office and are well-versed in the inner workings and issues of the political arena. The commission chairman, Wilkie, is a former federal judge. At today's press conference, he said he hopes to channel enthusiasm into practical actions. The commission has submitted the report to President Bush, and discussions on the report's suggestions are expected to take place with the president in the coming days.
