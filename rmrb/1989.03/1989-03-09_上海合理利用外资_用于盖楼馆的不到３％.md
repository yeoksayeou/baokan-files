Shanghai rationally utilized foreign capital last year, approving 309 projects involving foreign investment, totaling $545 million. Several notable features emerged in this work: industrial projects saw significant growth, accounting for 90% of the total approved projects, while large buildings and hotels constituted only 2.74%. There was a marked increase in large-scale industrial projects with substantial investments, particularly in the machinery, electronics, instrumentation, and raw materials industries, where 20 large and medium-sized projects each had a total investment exceeding $5 million. After the city delegated approval authority, the enthusiasm of districts and counties was stimulated, leading to a significant increase in small and medium-sized foreign-invested projects, more than doubling compared to the previous year.

　　上海合理利用外资
    用于盖楼馆的不到３％
    本报上海３月８日电  记者吕网大报道：上海市去年批准各类利用外资项目３０９个，吸收外资５．４５亿美元。这项工作有几个明显特点：工业性项目增长较快，占批准总数的９０％，而大楼、宾馆仅为２．７４％；投资额大的工业项目显著增加，总投资在５００万美元以上的机电、仪表、原材料工业的大中型项目就有２０个；市下放审批权后，调动了区、县的积极性，中小型外商投资项目十分活跃，比上年增加２倍多。
