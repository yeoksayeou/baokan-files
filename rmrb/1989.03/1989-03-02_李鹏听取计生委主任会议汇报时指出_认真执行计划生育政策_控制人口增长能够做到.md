Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, emphasized that all levels of leadership and the entire citizenry must enhance their population awareness and per capita consciousness, fully recognizing the importance and urgency of strengthening family planning work, and strictly implementing the current family planning policies. As long as we strengthen leadership and persistently work hard, it is possible to control the rapid population growth.

Li Peng made these remarks while listening to a work report from the National Family Planning Commission Directors' Meeting.

Li Peng said that the family planning work in 1988 achieved significant results. Compared to 1987, the trend of rapid population growth has been somewhat controlled. However, the current population situation remains severe. This year in April, the total population of mainland China will reach 1.1 billion. We are currently in the third phase of a population birth peak. If we cannot effectively control the rapid population growth, it will have serious impacts on the current efforts to rectify the economic environment, as well as on the process of reform, opening up, and the Four Modernizations.

He said, people often say that China is a country with vast territory and abundant resources. In absolute terms, China's resources are rich, but in terms of per capita, resources are relatively scarce. A large population, a weak foundation, and imbalanced economic and cultural development are our fundamental national conditions. Therefore, from the perspective of the survival of the Chinese nation, we must make implementing family planning a fundamental national policy. All levels of leadership and the entire citizenry must have a full understanding of the importance and urgency of family planning work.

Li Peng stressed that the family planning policy must be stable and strictly implemented according to the current family planning policy set by the central government. It is necessary to vigorously promote late marriage and late childbearing, fewer and better births, and advocate for one child per couple. For rural residents who have genuine difficulties, those who are approved to have a second child after a few years of interval should be strictly controlled. Minority nationalities should also promote family planning. This policy has been proven through practice to be in line with China's actual situation and must be adhered to and implemented in the long term, truly implemented at the grassroots level. It is necessary to resolutely stop multiple births and early marriages and childbearing.

Li Peng said that family planning work is a comprehensive task involving many departments such as health, civil affairs, public security, and commerce. All departments must fulfill their responsibilities in implementing this fundamental national policy. Relevant policies must be coordinated and conducive to promoting family planning, rather than stimulating or encouraging multiple births. Poverty alleviation work should be combined with family planning work. Strengthening the management of floating populations is imperative, whether from the perspective of family planning, social development, social life, or social order.

Li Peng pointed out that family planning work is important but also difficult. Therefore, all levels of party committees and governments must strengthen leadership. The main leaders of party committees and governments should personally oversee this work and implement a responsibility system, making the performance of family planning work an important criterion for evaluating officials' performance. In the future, the National Bureau of Statistics will publish the natural population growth rate of each province annually to strengthen supervision over the provinces. He said that it is necessary to actively strengthen the legal system of family planning, which is crucial for stabilizing family planning policies, strengthening family planning management, and improving the legal system. He also said that to do a good job in family planning, the family planning workforce must be consolidated, their quality improved, and their institutions strengthened.

Li Peng finally emphasized that in addition to necessary administrative and economic measures, the main task is to do a good job in mobilizing the masses. We not only need to make the people understand that implementing family planning is a duty stipulated by the Constitution, but also make them understand that family planning is beneficial not only to the country but also to their local area, village, and even their family and individual interests. He said that this work should carry forward the fine traditions of the party's mass work, with everyone participating in the work. It is necessary to mobilize the strength of all sectors of society to do this work.

    李鹏听取计生委主任会议汇报时指出
    认真执行计划生育政策
    控制人口增长能够做到
    据新华社北京3月1日电　国务院总理李鹏指出：必须使各级领导干部和全体公民，增强人口意识和人均观念，充分认识加强计划生育工作的重要性和紧迫性，认真执行现行计划生育政策。只要我们加强领导，坚韧不拔地努力工作，控制人口过快增长是能够做到的。
    李鹏是在日前听取全国计划生育委员会主任会议工作汇报时讲这番话的。
    李鹏说，1988年计划生育工作是有成绩的，与1987年比较，人口迅速增长的势头有所控制。但是，当前的人口形势仍然是严峻的。今年4月，全国大陆总人口数将达到11亿。我们正处在第三次人口出生高峰。如果不能有效地控制人口的过快增长，对当前治理经济环境，对改革开放和四化建设的进程都会产生严重的影响。他说，人们常说我国地大物博。从绝对数来说，我国的资源是丰富的，但是从人均水平看，资源又相对贫乏。人口多、底子薄、经济文化发展不平衡是我们的基本国情。所以，从中华民族的生存大计着想，我们必须把实行计划生育定为基本国策。各级领导干部和全体公民对于计划生育工作的重要性和紧迫性都应有充分的认识。
    李鹏强调，计划生育政策要稳定，要坚定不移地严格执行中央制定的现行计划生育政策，大力提倡晚婚晚育，少生优生，提倡一对夫妇只生育一个孩子。农村某些群众确有实际困难，经过批准间隔几年后生第二胎的也要从严掌握。少数民族也要提倡计划生育。这个政策经过实践证明，是符合我国实际情况的，在今后相当长的时期内必须坚持贯彻执行，把它真正落实到基层。要坚决制止多胎生育和早婚早育。
    李鹏说，计划生育工作是一项综合性的工作，关系到卫生、民政、公安、工商等很多部门。各部门，都要为贯彻落实计划生育这个基本国策竭尽自己的职责。有关的各项政策要协调一致，有利于促进计划生育，而不是刺激或鼓励多生。扶贫工作应该与计划生育工作结合起来。加强对流动人口的管理，无论是从计划生育，还是从社会发展、社会生活、社会治安等方面看，都势在必行。
    李鹏指出，计划生育工作很重要，难度又大，因此各级党委、政府必须切实加强领导，党委、政府的主要领导人应该亲自抓这项工作，并实行责任制，把计划生育工作好坏作为考核干部政绩的重要依据。今后，国家统计局每年要公布各省的人口自然增长率，以加强对各省的监督。他说，要积极加强计划生育法制建设，这对于稳定计划生育政策，加强计划生育管理，健全法制，都是十分必要的。他还说，为了做好计划生育工作，计划生育的工作队伍要巩固，素质要提高，机构要加强。
    李鹏最后强调指出，计划生育除了采取必要的行政手段、经济手段以外，主要是要做好群众工作。我们不仅要使人民懂得实行计划生育是宪法规定的公民应尽的义务，还要使他们懂得计划生育不仅对国家，而且对本地区、本乡、本村，以至家庭、个人都是有利的。他说，这项工作要发扬我们党的群众工作的优良传统，大家的事大家办，要动员社会各方面的力量来做。
