Shanghai Television Station has been broadcasting moving subtitles alongside its television programs, providing timely reminders based on everyday life and considering the needs of viewers. For example, at 7:30 PM: "Have you brought in the clothes hanging outside?" At 8:30 PM: "Students, you should go to bed early. You need to go to school tomorrow." At 11:00 PM: "Before going to bed, please check the safety of your coal and electricity."

The new subtitles began appearing on February 1 and have received a positive response from local residents. Retired teacher Huang Hongming said, "It has instantly shortened the distance between the television station and the viewers. Although it is a small thing, it brings a precious sense of warmth to the viewers."

    沪电视台荧屏新字幕受好评
    上海电视台在播放电视节目的同时，每天都定时打出了一些从生活实际出发，为观众着想的移动字幕。如19点30分：“晾在室外的衣物收回来了吗？”20点30分：“中小学同学们，你应早点睡，明早还要上学校读书。”23点：“睡前请再仔细检查一下煤电安全。”
    电视新字幕是从2月1日起开始出现的，在当地市民中引起普遍好的反应。老教师黄弘明说，它一下子缩短了电视台与观众的距离，事情虽小，却给观众带来一份宝贵的亲情。
