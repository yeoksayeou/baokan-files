Taiwan Faces Strong Inflation, Middle-Income Families Feel the Pressure

Taipei, March 9 (Xinhua) - In February, Taiwan's consumer prices rose by 4.07 percent compared to the same period last year, marking the largest increase since August 1982. Even some middle-income families are feeling the strain.

The Audit Department of Taiwan's Executive Yuan recently reported on price changes, noting that the consumer price index surged in February. This was primarily due to the Lunar New Year, during which demand for vegetables, fruits, and fish and meat increased. Additionally, rice prices were at their seasonal peak, leading to overall price increases. Due to poor harvests in the United States last year, the prices of imported wheat and barley from Taiwan remained high, directly affecting consumers. During this period, prices for cosmetics and taxi fares also increased.

The Price Supervision Committee of the Economic Affairs Department of Taiwan stated that to stabilize the upward trend, in addition to the bank's financial adjustment measures to curb money supply, import tariffs should be significantly reduced as soon as possible.

　　台湾涨价风劲
    中等收入家庭“顿感压力”
    本报香港三月九日电  台北消息：今年二月份，台湾物价比去年同期上涨百分之四点零七，为一九八二年八月以来最大的涨幅，连一些中等收入家庭也“顿感压力不轻”。
    台湾“行政院”审计处日前发表物价变动情况时表示，二月份消费者物价指数大幅上扬，主要因处在农历春节，蔬菜、水果、鱼肉等需求旺盛，而大米正值季节性上涨期，因而价格均告上扬。由于去年美国谷物歉收，台湾进口小麦、大麦等农产品的价位仍居高档，直接影响到消费者。这段时间化妆品及出租车亦加价。
    台“经济部”物价督导会报表示，为稳定涨势，除银行采取金融调节措施，抑制货币供给外，应尽速大幅降低进口关税。
