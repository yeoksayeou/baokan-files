    The head coach of the Cuban women's volleyball team, Jorge Eugenio, said in an interview with a reporter from this agency today that women's volleyball in 1988 reached a new height in all aspects.

    Eugenio pointed out: "Especially in the past four years, the women's volleyball of many countries has risen to a very high level."

    The 55-year-old Eugenio, in his 30-year career, has led the Cuban women's team to victory in many international competitions. When talking about the women's volleyball friendly cup being held in the capital of Cuba, he said that many players from the Soviet Union and Cuba teams were members of the All-Star team that participated in China in 1985, while the technical level of teams from East Germany, Brazil, and others has improved significantly. The women's teams from West Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Greece are catching up, and by the end of the century, they will be prominent on the international volleyball stage.

    When looking ahead to the fifth World Cup women's volleyball tournament to be held in November, Eugenio is optimistic about the Soviet Union team. He said the Soviet Union team is an "experienced team."

    He praised the recent restructuring of the Chinese women's volleyball team. He said that the current restructuring will weaken the Chinese women's volleyball team's offensive power, but "it has important strategic significance for the future."

    Eugenio pointed out: "Undoubtedly, the Chinese women's volleyball team will still be one of the world's top three in the near future."

　　欧亨尼奥简评世界女排形势
    新华社哈瓦那３月１３日电  古巴女排主教练赫奥尔赫·欧亨尼奥今天在这里接受本社记者采访时说，１９８８年的世界女子排球运动在各个方面都达到了一个新的高度。
    欧亨尼奥指出：“特别是近４年来，许多国家的女子排球运动都上升到一个非常高的水平。”
    现年５５岁的欧亨尼奥在他３０年的运动生涯中，曾率领古巴女排多次在国际比赛中获胜。他在谈到正在古巴首都举行的友谊杯女排赛时说，苏联队和古巴队中许多队员曾是１９８５年在中国参加全明星队比赛的成员，而民主德国、巴西等队技术有了较大提高。联邦德国、意大利、匈牙利和希腊等欧洲国家女队正在迎头赶上，到本世纪末将扬威国际排坛。
    在展望今年１１月举行的第五届世界杯女排赛时，欧亨尼奥看好苏联队，他说苏联队是一支“经验丰富的队伍”。
    他赞赏中国女排新近的改组。他说，新近的改组眼下会削弱中国女排的攻击力，但“对将来具有重要的战略意义”。
    欧亨尼奥指出：“无疑，中国女排在不久的将来仍将是世界三强之一。”
