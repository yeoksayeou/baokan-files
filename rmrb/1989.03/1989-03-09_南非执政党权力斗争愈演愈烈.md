The power struggle within South Africa's ruling National Party over whether President Botha should be dismissed has intensified. The new leader of the National Party, De Klerk, is seeking to hold an "emergency meeting" this week with President Botha to decide who will ultimately control the country.

Six weeks ago, the 73-year-old Botha was hospitalized due to a mild stroke and resigned as chairman of the National Party. He was succeeded by the Minister of National Education and leader of the National Party in the Transvaal province, De Klerk. The Minister of Constitutional Development and Planning, Chris Heunis, took over as acting president, breaking the tradition of the party chairman serving as president.

However, De Klerk is extremely dissatisfied with this "position without power" arrangement. Both inside and outside the National Party, many people are calling for Botha to resign immediately. However, in response to the growing calls for his resignation, Botha stated in an interview last weekend that he would continue to serve as president until his term ends in September this year and that it is too early to speculate on whether he will run for another term. The news of Botha's determination to stay in office has sparked a strong reaction within the National Party.

Why is the call for Botha's resignation growing louder within and outside the National Party? For a long time, the South African government led by Botha has implemented apartheid policies domestically and repeatedly engaged in subversive and aggressive actions against neighboring countries, making it the primary source of long-term instability in southern Africa. The international community has responded with a series of sanctions. The anti-apartheid struggle within South Africa is also intensifying. Strike waves among workers in various industries in South Africa are rising. International sanctions and the domestic anti-apartheid struggle have significantly weakened South Africa's economic strength, and the country's economy is on a downward trend. Under this immense pressure, some within the National Party attempt to use a change in leadership to escape international isolation and ease domestic tensions.

As for why Botha is unwilling to resign, a South African weekly magazine suggests that in Botha's view, Heunis is the ideal candidate for the presidency. The longer Botha stays in power, the more favorable it is for cultivating Heunis's influence.

However, De Klerk will not tolerate this. In the past few weeks, he has used his position as the new leader of the National Party to speak at various occasions, expressing his intention to continue the "reform plan" that Botha initiated in the 1970s but halted in recent years, preparing public opinion for his own ascent to the presidency.

However, analysts believe that regardless of whether Botha and De Klerk can hold an "emergency meeting" this week, and regardless of who ultimately controls South Africa, as long as the National Party's apartheid system is not fundamentally changed, the apartheid regime in South Africa will not be able to escape its predicament.

### 南非执政党权力斗争愈演愈烈

　　南非执政党权力斗争愈演愈烈
    陈鹤高
    南非执政党国民党内围绕博塔总统要不要解职的一场权力之争愈演愈烈。国民党新领导人德克勒克正在争取本周内同博塔总统举行一次“紧急会议”，决定他们两人中到底由谁主宰这个国家。
    六个星期以前，７３岁的博塔因轻度中风住院，辞去了国民党主席职务，由国民教育部长、国民党德兰士瓦省领导人德克勒克接任。立宪发展和计划部长克里斯·霍尼斯担任了代总统，从而打破了历来由该党主席担任总统的惯例。
    但是，德克勒克对这种“有职无权”的安排极为不满，国民党内外也有许多人要求博塔尽快辞职。可是，面对国民党内外要求博塔辞职的呼声，博塔总统上周末在接受记者采访时宣称，他将在今年９月任满以前继续担任总统，并认为人们猜测他“是否担任下一届总统还为时过早”。博塔决心留任的消息在国民党内引起了强烈反响。
    为什么要求博塔辞职的呼声在国民党内外越来越高呢？长期以来，以博塔为首的南非政府，对内实行种族主义政策，对外不断对邻国进行颠覆侵略，是南部非洲长期不稳定的主要根源。国际社会对此采取了一系列的制裁行动。南非国内反种族主义的斗争也日益高涨。南非各行各业工人的罢工浪潮一浪高过一浪。国际社会的制裁和国内人民反种族主义的斗争，大大削弱了南非的经济实力，南非经济正在走下坡路。在强大的压力之下，国民党中的一些人企图利用更换总统来摆脱在国际上的孤立局面，缓和国内矛盾。
    至于博塔为什么不愿辞职，南非一家周刊认为，在博塔看来，霍尼斯是最理想的总统接班人。他占据总统宝座的时间越长，对培植霍尼斯的势力越有利。
    不过，德克勒克对此是不会容忍的。在过去几周内，他利用国民党新领导人的身份在许多场合发表讲话，表示要继续在南非实行博塔７０年代开始而在近几年中止的“改革计划”，为自己登上总统宝座作舆论准备。
    但是，分析家们认为，不管博塔和德克勒克在本周内能否举行“紧急会议”，不管南非最后由谁来主宰，只要国民党实施的种族主义制度不彻底改变，南非种族主义政权就不可能摆脱困境。
