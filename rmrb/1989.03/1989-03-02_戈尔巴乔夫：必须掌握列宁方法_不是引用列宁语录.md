	Gorbachev: We Must Master Lenin's Methods, Not Just Quote Lenin's Sayings
	Gorbachev Meets with Italian Communist Party General Secretary

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 28

	Soviet leader Gorbachev said today during a meeting with the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Achille Occhetto, that we must master Lenin's methods, Lenin's dialectics, and his political experience. However, this does not mean copying and returning to past forms, or quoting Lenin's sayings. Instead, it means learning from Lenin's teachings. Lenin said that we must eliminate those concepts that distort and deviate from socialism.

	According to TASS, the two party leaders also exchanged views on a wide range of international issues, including the European workers' movement, the construction of a "European House," and environmental protection. They also discussed the matter of Gorbachev's visit to Italy.

	Occhetto arrived in Moscow on February 27 for a working visit. This is his first visit to the Soviet Union since he became the General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party last year.

	This afternoon, Occhetto held a press conference here, saying that his talks with Gorbachev were "broad in content and particularly frank," and that the two sides "agreed on many issues."

    戈尔巴乔夫：
    必须掌握列宁方法  不是引用列宁语录
    戈氏与意共总书记会谈
    新华社莫斯科2月28日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫今天与意大利共产党总书记阿基莱·奥凯托会谈时说，必须掌握列宁的方法、列宁的辩证法和政治经验，但这不是要照抄和回到过去的形式，不是引用列宁的语录，而是要学习列宁的教导。列宁说，要去掉那些歪曲和背离社会主义的概念。
    据塔斯社报道，两位党的领导人还就欧洲工人运动、建立“欧洲大厦”、生态保护等广泛的国际问题交换了意见。他们还讨论了有关戈尔巴乔夫访问意大利的问题。
    奥凯托是2月27日到达莫斯科进行工作访问的。这是他自去年担任意共总书记后对苏联的首次访问。
    今天下午奥凯托在这里举行记者招待会说，他和戈尔巴乔夫的会谈“内容广泛，气氛特别坦率”，双方“在许多问题上观点一致”。
