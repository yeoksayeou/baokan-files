Yesterday afternoon, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic Revolutionary Party and member of the Political Consultative Conference, Hou Jianru, solemnly expressed on behalf of the China Democratic Revolutionary Party Central Committee a willingness to engage in contact and dialogue with the Central Committee of the Kuomintang in Taiwan.

Hou Jianru made this appeal during the Seventh National People's Congress, Second Session, held at the Great Hall of the People. He expressed a willingness to reach a consensus on the following three points and issue a joint statement: First, there is only one China, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of China; second, oppose Taiwan independence, and those who advocate for Taiwan independence are traitors to the Chinese nation; third, the unification of Taiwan and the mainland is China's internal affair and does not allow foreign interference.

He emphasized that the above three points are what the late Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Mr. Chiang Ching-kuo, and the current ruling Mr. Lee Teng-hui have repeatedly stated. He suggested putting these into written form to prevent opportunists and adventurers from interfering and coveting.

It is reported that in the past year, 450,000 Taiwanese have traveled to the mainland for family visits and tourism, while fewer than 400 mainlanders have been permitted to travel to Taiwan. With the tacit approval of the Taiwanese authorities, pro-independence forces on the island have shifted from underground to overt activities. Hou Jianru said that all these actions, which go against the will of the people and the natural order, cannot help but arouse serious concern among the people of the motherland.

Hou Jianru called for, before the peaceful reunification of the motherland, the implementation of trade, mail, and transportation links. Time waits for no one, and we must seize the opportunity. We must have a sense of urgency and mission regarding the great cause of national reunification and not leave this historical task to future generations.

His speech at the conference was met with enthusiastic applause from the attendees.

　　侯镜如代表民革中央表示        
    愿与台国民党中央对话
    本报北京３月２６日讯  记者何伟、费伟伟报道：昨天下午，民革中央副主席、政协委员侯镜如代表中国国民党革命委员会郑重表示，愿与台湾国民党中央进行接触对话。
    侯镜如是在人民大会堂进行的七届二次会议上发出这一呼吁的。他表示，愿就以下三点达成共识，发表联合声明：一、中国只有一个，台湾是中国不可分割的一部分；二、反对台湾独立，主张台湾独立者即为中华民族之罪人；三、台湾与大陆的统一是中国的内政，不容外国干涉。
    他强调，以上三条，也是已故蒋介石先生、蒋经国先生和现在执政的李登辉先生所一再申明者，用文字形式肯定下来，以杜绝野心家和冒险家的染指和觊觎。
    据介绍，过去一年中，台湾４５万人次的探亲旅游者涌往大陆，而被允许赴台的大陆人员却不到４００人。在台湾当局的默许下，岛内台独势力已由地下转为地上。侯镜如委员说，凡此种种有悖民心天理之举，不能不引起祖国人民的严重关切。
    侯镜如在发言中呼吁，和平统一祖国之前，先实行通商、通邮和通航，时不我待，机不可失，我们对于祖国统一大业，必须有紧迫感、使命感，不要把这一历史任务留给后人。
    他的大会发言赢得了与会委员的热烈掌声。
