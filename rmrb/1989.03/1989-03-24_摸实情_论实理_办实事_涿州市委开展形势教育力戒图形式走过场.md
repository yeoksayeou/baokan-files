From the capital, take a train south for 62 kilometers, and you will arrive at Cangzhou, Hebei Province, once known as "the first prefecture under heaven." In early spring, situation education is being fully implemented across the city.

On March 11, over 300 government officials, under the unified arrangement of the municipal party committee, went to various towns, townships, sub-districts, and municipal enterprises to study documents with the people and engage in dialogue. The municipal party secretary, Fan Wenbin, said that everyone's thoughts must be united on rectification and deepening reforms, and it cannot be just about one person lecturing and others listening. There must be a series of supporting measures. Since October last year, the Cangzhou municipal party committee, in accordance with the arrangements of the Hebei provincial party committee and the Baoding regional party committee, conducted situation education pilot programs in Xianhu Liang, Biangezhuang, Nanma Township, and Songlin Store Township. Through investigations and research in different townships and at different levels, they initially grasped the people's views on the situation and identified the issues that the people were most concerned about and had the strongest reactions to. This citywide situation education is being carried out based on the experience of these pilot programs.

Solving the "Five Grievances" and "Three Fears" of Farmers

At the Jiaxiu Road agricultural market, I met a woman selling mushrooms, about 40 years old. She did not want to reveal her name and address, but she spoke frankly.

"How much per pound?" I saw that there were only one or two pounds of mushrooms left in the basket, so I picked up a handful and asked her.

"Nine jiao." She told me that during the farming off-season from October to early spring, her family set up a plastic greenhouse and planted over 100 square meters of mushrooms, harvesting two large baskets a day, weighing about 60 to 70 pounds.

I wanted to calculate her family's income, but she quickly took over and said, "What's the big deal about earning this little money?" She started complaining about how money was losing its value, speaking non-stop...

The Cangzhou municipal party committee pays attention to the voices and reflections of the people at the grassroots level to understand their views on the situation. After organizing municipal and township officials to conduct investigations and research in rural areas, they learned that farmers' understanding of the current situation was mainly focused on the "five grievances" and "three fears": first, they are upset about the rising prices of production materials and industrial products; second, they are upset about the low purchase prices for grain; third, they are upset about the scarcity of fertilizers, water, oil, and electricity; fourth, they are upset about the numerous fines and levies; fifth, they are upset about the poor work style of grassroots cadres. Regarding the deepening of rural reforms, some people also have doubts: they fear that appropriate scale management will take back the land, fear that a few people will get rich while the majority suffer, and fear that rectification and order will affect the development of township enterprises.

Despite so many "grievances" and "fears," you can hear farmers talking about them everywhere, but once the policies and principles of reform are presented to them in a language and form that they can easily accept, and the difficulties currently encountered are analyzed in the context of the situation, as local cadres put it, farmers will also move you. Biangezhuang Township Party Committee listed eight topics and organized party members and cadres to have heart-to-heart talks with farmers on their kang beds, and finally asked them to answer one by one. Out of 200 questionnaires collected, only one person said that reform or no reform made no difference, while 199 people expressed support for and support of reform. Most people also expressed understanding of difficulties such as price increases. One farmer said, "In the past, human and animal manure and wood ash were all organic fertilizers for farmers, and 10 pounds of chemical fertilizer per mu was enough. Now everyone wants to save labor and buy chemical fertilizer, using over 100 pounds per mu, how can prices not rise?" Some farmers said, "Scarce resources can increase in price, but we hope it won't be too much and too fast."

In Ning Village, Biangezhuang Township, there is a 57-year-old farmer named He Jinhu. He has five sons and one daughter. In the past, he was known in the village as a "squatter" (someone who borrows others' houses to live in), having squatted in 17 different homes. Later, with the help of the village, he built five rooms, but his four sons could only share one quilt. In just a few years, his family, through raising pigs, slaughtering pigs, and responsible fields, built five sets of rooms, and his four sons had all married. Old He talked about the changes brought by ten years of reform, saying, "If it were the poor situation of the past, my sons would all have to be bachelors."

Party Cadres Are the Main Targets of Education

On the surface, organizing cadres to conduct situation education at the grassroots level seems to target the masses. In reality, it is not entirely the case. Cadres going to the grassroots level, using events from the people's lives and their personal experiences, summarizing the achievements of ten years of reform, and discussing and analyzing the difficulties and problems encountered in the reform process with the people on an equal footing, also receive education themselves. The Public Security Bureau, through situation education, improved the public security management of grassroots police stations based on issues that the people strongly reflected, and further implemented strict law enforcement measures from increasing the sense of security of the people and other aspects. The tax bureau director of Nanma Township proposed "buy your own cigarettes and cook your own meals," insisting on clean governance. The director of the municipal tax bureau told me that smoking and eating seem like small matters, but doing them well is not easy. You can go to Nanma now and see that no tax officials smoke the cigarettes of their clients, and no one eats at individual restaurants. In this way, their work also becomes easier.

The attitudes of party cadres towards reform and the difficulties and problems encountered in the reform process have a significant impact on the people. In a public opinion survey at the Jin Silk Carpet Factory, an old worker reflected that not only workers and farmers have opinions about corruption in government departments, but cadres at all levels also have their own dissatisfaction. He believed that what is most lacking now is "starting with myself."

During my visit to Cangzhou, I met with Zhang Yucheng, the party secretary of Songlin Store Township, and Chen Binghui, the party secretary of Biangezhuang Township. They both had a common view on situation education, which is to take various levels of leaders and the majority of party members as the main targets of situation education. Once the thoughts of party cadres are unified, there will be cohesion, and the people's affairs will be easier to handle.

The Cangzhou municipal party committee proposed that situation education should clarify the actual situation, discuss real issues, and do real work, in order to achieve the goals of enlightenment, resolving grievances, and boosting morale. They used municipal and township party schools to conduct training for cadres and all party members in batches, and then launched "democratic evaluation of cadres" and "democratic evaluation of party members" activities across the city. Since the end of last year, the city has dealt with 42 unqualified party members through organizational measures, and implemented one-on-one assistance measures for 156 basically unqualified party members. Based on democratic evaluation and organizational investigation, the city has adjusted the work of 128 cadres, with 7 receiving demotion or dismissal. These measures, combined with situation education, have ignited a sense of responsibility and urgency among party cadres, and some townships and towns have proactively launched discussions on "cadres' image" and "party members' image."

Currently, various departments in Cangzhou are starting from issues that the people have strong opinions about, further improving their work. This year, the city's investment in agriculture will reach 10 million yuan, with the proportion of municipal financial investment increasing by over 50% compared to last year. The expansion project of the municipal fertilizer plant, once completed, will change the current situation of producing only 10,000 tons of ammonium carbonate annually, and will have the capacity to produce 30,000 tons of synthetic ammonium annually. Across the city, 1,365 technical personnel from 55 units have formed an agricultural socialized service system at the municipal, township, and village levels, with 421 people signing various contract agreements with grassroots units and individuals. The difficulties and problems facing agricultural production will be greatly alleviated, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest this year.

　　摸实情　论实理　办实事        
    ——涿州市委开展形势教育力戒图形式走过场
    本报记者  徐如俊
    从京城乘火车出发，南行６２公里，就是曾有“天下第一州”之称的河北省涿州市。初春季节，形势教育在这个市全面铺开。
    ３月１１日，３００余名机关干部，在市委统一安排下，分赴各乡、镇、办事处和市直企业，到那里跟群众一起学习文件，进行对话。市委书记范文斌说，要把大家的思想统一到治理整顿和深化改革上来，不能单纯搞你讲我听，必须有一系列配套措施。从去年１０月开始，涿州市委根据河北省委、保定地委的安排部署，先后在下胡良、边各庄、南马乡和松林店镇进行了形势教育试点，通过不同乡、镇和不同层次的调查研究，初步掌握了群众对形势的看法，掌握了群众意见最大、反映最强烈的问题。这次全市开展形势教育，就是在总结试点经验的基础上进行的。
    　　　　解决农民“五怨”、“三怕”
    在甲秀路农贸市场，我见到一位卖蘑菇的妇女，４０岁左右的年纪，她不愿意透露自己的姓名和地址，但说起话来挺爽快。
    “多少钱１斤？”我见筐里只剩一二斤蘑菇，抓起一把向她提问。
    “九角”。她告诉我，利用１０月至开春３月这段农闲，她家搭了个塑料大棚，栽了１００多平方米的蘑菇，每天能采两大筐，有六七十斤重。
    我想给她家算笔收入账，可她忙接过话头说：“赚这几个钱算啥？”她数落起钱不值钱的事来，滔滔不绝……
    涿州市委注意从最基层群众的呼声和反映中，掌握人们对形势的认识。他们组织市、乡干部深入农村开展调查研究后，了解到农民对目前形势的认识，比较集中的是“五怨”、“三怕”：一怨生产资料、工业产品乱涨价，二怨粮食征购价格低，三怨肥水油电太紧缺，四怨罚款、摊派多，五怨基层干部作风差。对农村深化改革，也有人心存疑虑：怕适度规模经营收回土地，怕少数人乘机发财，多数人吃亏，怕治理整顿影响乡镇企业发展。
    尽管这么多“怨”，那么多“怕”，走到哪里都可以听到农民说几句，但一旦通过群众易于接受的语言和形式，把改革的方针、政策与他们见面，分析一下目前遇到的困难是在什么样的情况下出现的，用当地干部的话说，农民又会使你受到感动。边各庄乡党委列了８个题目，组织党员干部到农民炕头上谈心、聊天，最后请他们逐一回答。２００份答卷收上来，除１人表示改革与不改革无所谓以外，１９９人都表示赞成和拥护改革，对物价上涨等困难，大多数也表示可以理解。有位农民说，过去人粪马粪草木灰，全是农家有机肥，一亩地只用１０来斤化肥就够了。现在都图省工买化肥，一亩地用到１００多斤，怎能不涨价？有的农民说，紧缺物资涨点价也可以，但希望少涨一点，别那么快。
    边各庄乡宁村有个５７岁的农民叫何金虎，家有５个儿子１个闺女，以前他是村里有名的“蹓房檐”（借人家的房子住），先后蹓住过１７家，后来靠村里救济盖起了５间房，但４个儿子只能盖一床被。就这么几年的工夫，他家靠养猪、宰猪再加责任田，先后盖起５套房，大的四个儿子都已娶了媳妇。何老汉谈到十年改革变化时说：“要是以前那副穷样，我那儿子们都得打‘光棍’”。
    　　　　党员干部是主要教育对象
    从表面上看，组织干部到基层开展形势教育，教育对象是群众。其实，不完全是这样。干部到基层去，用群众身边的事、个人经历，总结十年改革的成就，平等地同群众探讨、分析改革过程中遇到的困难和问题，干部本身也受到了教育。市公安局通过形势教育，根据群众反映比较强烈的问题，改进基层派出所治安管理，从增加人民群众安全感等方面，进一步落实了从严治警的措施。南马乡税务所所长提出“抽烟自己买，吃饭自己做”，坚持为政清廉。市税务局局长告诉我，抽烟、吃饭说起来都是小事，但做好了很不容易。你现在可以到南马去看一看，没有一名税务干部抽客户的烟，也没有一个人到个体户饭馆里吃饭。这样，他们的工作也就好做了。
    党员干部对改革的认识，对改革过程中遇到的困难、问题所持的态度，对人民群众的影响很大。金丝挂毯厂在民意测验中有一位老工人反映，对于政府部门中的腐败现象，不光工人、农民有意见，各级干部也有自己的不满情绪。他认为，现在最缺少的就是“从我做起”。
    在涿州采访时，我先后见到了松林店镇党委书记张玉成和边各庄乡党委书记陈炳辉，他们对形势教育有一个共同的看法，就是要把各级领导和广大党员作为形势教育的主要对象。党员干部的思想统一了，就有了凝聚力，群众的事情也就好办了。
    涿州市委提出，形势教育要摸清实际情况，说实实在在道理，办实实在在的事，以达到明理、消怨、鼓劲的目的。他们利用市、乡党校，先后对各级干部和全体党员普遍进行了轮训，紧接着又在全市范围内开展了“民主评议干部”、“民主评议党员”活动。去年底以来，全市对４２名不合格党员进行了组织处理，对１５６名基本不合格党员落实了专人帮教措施。根据民主评议和组织考察，全市对１２８名干部的工作进行了调整，７人受到降职、免职处理。这些措施与形势教育相配套，激发了党员干部的责任感、紧迫感，一些乡、镇还主动开展了“干部形象”、“党员形象”的讨论。
    目前，涿州市各级部门正从群众意见比较集中的问题着手，进一步改进工作。今年，全市用于农业的投资将达到１０００万元，其中市财政投资比重比去年增加５０％以上。市化肥厂扩建工程落实扩建后，将改变目前年产只有１万吨碳铵的状况，具备年产３万吨合成铵的能力。全市５５个单位的１３６５名科技人员，在市、乡、村形成了农业社会化服务体系，有４２１人同基层单位和个人签订了各种承包合同。农业生产面临的困难和问题，将会很大程度地得到解决，为夺取今年农业丰收奠定了基础。
