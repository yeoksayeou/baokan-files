The United States today stated that the Palestine Liberation Organization should participate in negotiations to peacefully resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.

The new U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas Pickering, said at a press conference that the United States does not rule out the possibility that the PLO may need to participate in some capacity in the talks.

In response to the question of whether the United States considers the PLO to be a party to the resolution of the Middle East issue, Pickering said that genuine negotiations among the relevant parties is the way to peacefully resolve the Middle East conflict.

He said that the U.S. government will "try to facilitate negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians." He pointed out that holding an international conference is one way to begin the process of Middle East talks.
