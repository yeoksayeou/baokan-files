The Japanese magazine *Choice* published an article titled *"Can the 'Japanese Century' Arrive?"* in its second issue of 1989. The article provides information from various perspectives. The following is a summary:

Favorable International Situation: Benefiting from its coastal geography, Japan does not need to spend much on defense. Additionally, protected by the Peace Constitution and the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, Japan can continue to maintain national security with minimal defense spending. This means that a large number of valuable human resources can be invested in non-military fields. Today, due to the high level of military technology, it is difficult to convert military technology to civilian use. Most countries have to divide their efforts between civilian and military sectors. Japan's advantage in this regard is unlikely to change in the future. Furthermore, as the two superpowers rebuild their economies, they will both seek Japan's technological and financial cooperation. Clearly, this is an ideal international environment for Japan.

Thriving Manufacturing Industry: Software alone cannot drive the entire economy. If the software industry is the brain, then the manufacturing industry is the spine. Without a healthy spine to support the brain, the brain will become sluggish. In this regard, Japan has not been intoxicated by the trend of softening, but has consistently encouraged the development of the hardware industry and valued manufacturing. The economic trend of the 1990s will shift from emphasizing military industry to emphasizing civilian industry, so people will definitely seek to revitalize the manufacturing industry. Currently, developed countries are paying attention to equipment investment. Among the countries that can meet global demand in terms of both quality and quantity, Japan is unparalleled. Although countries like West Germany can meet global demand to some extent, they cannot compare with Japan.

The New Trend of the Third Industrial Revolution: According to most historians of technology, the third industrial revolution began in the latter half of the 1970s and is currently in the preparatory stage. It will enter the mainstream in the 1990s. One important feature of the third industrial revolution is the increasing development of interface technologies that combine, integrate, and unify various technologies. For example, the combination of mechanics and electronics has produced robots. When seeking not only the development of a single technology but also the combination of several technologies to achieve multi-faceted technological development, the key is to have a diversified spirit of innovation. The business community in Europe and America does not have the tradition of placing excellent technical personnel in production sites, but rather adopts a division of labor system where research institutes are responsible for research and development and technology development, and factories are responsible for production and manufacturing. Under this system, it is difficult to produce technological innovations that qualify to lead the third industrial revolution. In contrast, Japanese enterprises place excellent technical personnel in production sites, and this traditional method of technological development and improvement is well-suited to the current era of technological innovation.

Japan will become a new type of great power—not relying on military strength and territory, but rather on the comprehensive strength of economics, finance, and technology, enabling it to have the power to drive the world economy. Whether this era can be called the "Japanese Century" is another matter, but it is undeniable that Japan's golden age will arrive in the mid-1990s.

专栏：外论摘要

　　机遇与创造共存
    日本《选择》杂志一九八九年第二期刊登了一篇题为《“日本世纪”能否到来？》的文章，提供了多方面的信息，现摘要如下：
    有利的国际形势：受惠于临海这一地理条件，日本不需要太多的防卫费。再加上受和平宪法和日美安全条约的保护，日本今后依然可用最低限的防卫费维持国家安全。这意味着可将大批宝贵的人力资源投入到非军事领域中。今天由于军事技术高度发达，技术已很难实现从军用向民用的转变。大多数国家都不得不在民用和军用两个领域中分散精力。日本的这种优势今后恐怕也不会改变。此外，两个超级大国在重建经济过程中，都将希望得到日本的技术合作、金融合作。显然对日本来说，这是一种最理想的国际环境。
    繁荣的制造业：仅靠软件是无法驱动整个经济发展的。如果说软件产业是头脑，那么制造业便是脊椎。如果没有健全的脊骨支撑头脑，那么头脑就会迟钝。就这一点而言，日本没有被软化的潮流所陶醉，而是一直鼓励硬件产业的发展，重视制造业。九十年代世界经济的潮流将是从重视军工产业转向重视民用产业，因此人们肯定要谋求重新振兴制造业。目前各发达国家都注意设备投资。在能够从质和量两个方面适应世界性需求的国家中，日本是首屈一指的。西德等国虽说也能在某种程度上满足世界性需求，但却无法与日本相比。
    第三次产业革命的新潮流：按照多数技术史家的说法，第三次产业革命已从七十年代后半期开始，目前正处于助跑阶段，九十年代将步入正轨。第三次产业革命的一个重要特征是，以技术与技术间的结合、融合、统一这种方式表现出来的衔接技术越来越发达。比如机械与电子相结合产生了机器人等。在不仅谋求单一技术上发展，而且要把几种技术结合起来，以求实现多方面的技术发展时，关键是要有多样化的创造精神。欧美的企业界并没有把优秀的技术人员安排在生产现场的传统，而是采用研究所负责研究开发和技术开发、工厂负责生产制造这样一种分工体制。在这种体制下很难出现具有领导第三次产业革命资格的技术革新。相反，日本企业把优秀的技术人员安排在生产现场，这种传统的技术开发和技术改良方式，正好适应了如今的技术革新时代的要求。
    日本将成为这样一种新型大国——不是借助军事实力和领土，而是依靠经济、金融和技术的综合力量，使自己具有足以驱动世界经济的实力。这个时代是否可称之为“日本世纪”另当别论，但是日本的黄金时代将在九十年代中期到来，这一点恐怕是毫无疑问的。
