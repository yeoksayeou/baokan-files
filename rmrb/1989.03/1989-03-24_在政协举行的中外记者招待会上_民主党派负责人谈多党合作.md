Despite coinciding with the first session of the Political Consultative Conference, nearly 100 domestic and foreign journalists attended the press conference held this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People, focusing on the issue of multi-party cooperation. Vice Chairman Jia Yibin of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Vice Chairman Wan Guoquan of the China Democratic League, Secretary-General Wu Xiuping of the China Democratic League, and Secretary-General Zhao Wei of the China Zhi Gong Party were present to answer journalists' questions.

	Welcome to Establish Party Connections with Taiwan

A female reporter from Xinhua News Agency asked: Are there any connections between the democratic parties on the mainland and the political parties in Taiwan?

Vice Chairman Jia Yibin of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang said that some parties have established some connections with us, but we will not have contact with organizations and parties that advocate "Taiwan independence."

Wan Guoquan said that the key to this issue lies not with the mainland but with the authorities in Taiwan. This time, it is said that more than ten Taiwanese journalists have come to report, and we welcome them very much. However, it is very difficult for our journalists to go to Taiwan for reporting. I personally would like to go to Taiwan because my father died there. I want to visit his grave, which is a natural human sentiment, but I am restricted.

A Taiwanese journalist asked: If the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan wants to come to the mainland to participate in multi-party cooperation and joint governance, what would the mainland authorities' attitude be?

Wan Guoquan smiled and said: This issue might have to be discussed after unification. It cannot be done before unification.

Wan Guoquan confirmed that Mr. Zhu Gaozheng, a standing committee member of the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan, has had contact with the mainland, but this does not represent the organization; it is an individual action.

	Democratic Parties Have a Voice

A reporter from the Taiwan China Times asked: Multi-party cooperation has existed since the early days of the founding of the nation. Although democratic party members have held the position of minister, in fact, it is the deputy ministers who are Communist Party members that hold the real power. Are the democratic parties satisfied with this?

Jia Yibin replied that the situation where democratic party ministers had no power was not generally true. There were some cases of "leftist" interference in individual places. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, multi-party cooperation has been further improved and developed.

A journalist asked: If the multi-party cooperation system is equal, why emphasize the leadership of the Communist Party of China?

Wan Guoquan answered this question by using an analogy. He said that both the democratic parties and the Communist Party have common goals, but there must be a chief designer, and a large orchestra must have a conductor; otherwise, how can the steps be consistent?

Wu Xiuping emphasized that democratic parties have a voice in major national issues and participate in political life from the beginning of decision-making.

A journalist asked: Will the multi-party cooperation system be explicitly stated in the Constitution?

Wan Guoquan answered this question by saying that the current Constitution already mentions the united front. Currently, the Communist Party and the democratic parties are discussing and improving the plan for multi-party cooperation. If the Constitution needs to be amended, it is a matter for the National People's Congress, not just one party's issue.

	Selection of Democratic Party Members for Government Positions Under Negotiation

A journalist asked Wu Xiuping: Will there be any members of the China Democratic League serving as leaders of the State Council in the near future?

Wu Xiuping replied that this work is currently in progress, with preparations being made for recommendations from the bottom up and democratic selection. The candidates have not yet been determined and are still under negotiation.

A journalist from the Associated Press asked: The eight democratic parties were all established before liberation. Is it possible to establish new democratic parties now?

Zhao Wei replied: In my personal opinion, it is not possible to establish new parties. Because the eight democratic parties have already established very broad connections in national political life.

	China Will Not Practice Rotating Governance

A journalist from the Hungarian News Agency hoped that the leaders of several democratic parties would discuss their views on the political system reforms in Eastern Europe, including Hungary.

Wan Guoquan believed that this is an internal affair of the Eastern European countries, and we are not in a position to comment on this issue here. He emphasized that the national conditions are different, and China cannot practice rotating governance but will continue to improve and develop the multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party.

　　在政协举行的中外记者招待会上        
    民主党派负责人谈多党合作
    本报北京３月２３日讯  记者费伟伟报道：尽管与政协第一次大会发言同时举行，仍有近百名中外记者参加了政协今天下午在人民大会堂举行的关于多党合作问题的记者招待会。民革中央副主席贾亦斌、民建中央副主席万国权、民盟中央秘书长吴修平和九三学社中央秘书长赵伟之到会回答了记者的提问。
    　　　　欢迎与台湾建立党派联系
    中新社一位女记者问：大陆民主党派与台湾政党之间是否有某种联系？
    民革中央副主席贾亦斌说，现在有些党派和我们建立了一些联系，但那些有“台独”主张的组织和政党，我们不会接触。
    万国权说，这个问题的关键不在大陆，在于台湾当局。这次听说有十几位台湾记者来采访，我们非常欢迎，但是我们记者想到台湾去采访就非常困难。我本人就很想去台湾，因为我父亲死在台湾。我想去扫墓，人之常情嘛，但受到限制。
    有台湾记者问，如果台湾的民主进步党要来大陆参加多党合作、联合执政的话，大陆当局态度如何？
    万国权笑着说，这个问题恐怕要到统一后才能谈到。统一前还办不到。
    万国权证实，台湾民进党常委朱高正先生和大陆有接触，但不代表组织，是个人行为。
    　　　　民主党派有发言权
    台湾《中国时报》一位记者提问说：多党派合作在建国初期就有，民主党派人士虽然担任了部长，但事实上是中共党员的副部长掌有实权，民主党派是不是就觉得很满足了？
    贾亦斌回答说，当时民主党派的部长没权的情况总体上不是事实的，个别的地方存在“左”的干扰的情况是有的，十一届三中全会后，多党合作得到了进一步完善和发展。
    有记者问，多党合作制如果是平等的，为何要强调中国共产党领导？
    万国权回答这个问题时打了一个比方。他说，民主党派和共产党都有共同的目标，但总得有个总设计员，一个大乐队总得有个指挥，否则步调怎能一致？
    吴修平强调，民主党派在国家重大问题上是有发言权的，从决策开始就参预到政治生活中。
    有记者问，多党合作制度是否会在宪法中明确化？
    万国权回答这一问题时说，现在宪法中已讲了统一战线，目前中共与民主党派正在研讨充实完善多党合作的方案。如果要修改宪法的话，是人大的事，不是一个党派的问题。
    　　　　民主党派人士到国务院任职人选在协商中
    记者问吴修平，近期内民盟有没有人担任国务院领导职务？
    吴修平回答说，这一工作正在进行中，准备由下而上推荐，民主选拔。目前人选还没确定，正在协商中。
    一位美联社记者问，八个民主党都是解放前建立的，现在是否有可能建新的民主党？
    赵伟之回答说，我个人认为不可能建新的党派。因为八个民主党派在国家政治生活中的联系面已经非常广泛。
    　　　　我国不搞轮流执政
    匈牙利通讯社的一位记者希望几位民主党派领导人谈谈他们对东欧、包括匈牙利进行政治体制改革的看法。
    万国权认为，这是东欧国家的内政，我们在这个场合不便议论。他强调，各国的国情不同，我国不能搞轮流执政，而是将不断完善和发展共产党领导下的多党合作。
