	On the Far Side of the Moon
		Lù Wěirán

	After reading the article "The Far Side of the Moon" published in the February 18 issue of the *Dàdì* supplement, I felt there was more to discuss, or perhaps some overlapping points, which led me to write this article.

	From a scientific perspective, the far side of the moon is not always a dark world. There is darkness and there is light. When we see a thin crescent moon, the far side is actually brightly lit. Many times, when the moon's visible side is dark and facing us, the far side is fully illuminated. This can be understood by observing the moon during a solar eclipse, when it appears black to us.

	The existence of the dark side does not diminish the moon's brightness. The dark side of the moon is not static or immobile. The dark side is constantly moving. Why does the full moon wane? It is because of the existence and movement of the dark side. The dark side's existence does not only diminish the moon's brightness but will eventually consume all of the moon's light. The final disappearance of the waning crescent moon is proof of this.

	Therefore, in dealing with the dark side, first, we must not acknowledge it as a legitimate resident and must create a situation where everyone criticizes it; second, if we ourselves have a dark side, we must learn from Rousseau's introspection, expose it to the sunlight, and thus turn the dark areas into light. Otherwise, how can we expect the moon's brightness to remain undiminished?

	Great people or famous individuals are like the moon, they also have a side we cannot see. Some of these sides are dark, and pointing out their darkness is necessary; otherwise, once a person becomes great, they easily become a god. Some sides are originally bright, just like the far side of the moon during a solar eclipse, so it is not necessary to find darkness in these sides.

	When the moon is in a crescent shape, most of the light is on the far side. But we often forget this. Yes, we have been deceived many times, mistaking foul for fragrant, black for white, and thinking that the moon's visible side, which is mostly dark with only a narrow strip of light, is entirely bright. In this, there are external causes, but also our tendency to face darkness without acknowledging its existence, always assuming that darkness is on the far side of the moon.

	The far side of the moon does have darkness, but this darkness needs to be analyzed. One type is caused by the contrast of sunlight, meaning it is bright when the sun shines and dark when the sun leaves. This darkness is caused by sunlight, not inherent to the moon. Another type is due to the moon's surface structure. The far side of the moon has many craters, jagged rocks, and seas (which are actually plains). Due to the moon's surface structure, some places appear shadowy even when in sunlight.

	If we say that all great people or famous individuals have a far side of the moon, all escaping shadows, then this shadow also needs to be analyzed. Is it inherent or not? Is it a flaw or an error? Is it a matter of thought process or moral character? Is it a general mistake or a kind of sin? If we do not distinguish, label everything as a "dark side," and attack indiscriminately, won't we wrongly accuse the innocent!

	We cannot conclude that the far side of the moon is always a dark world just because it is sometimes dark. Similarly, we cannot conclude that everyone must have a dark side just because some great people or famous individuals have certain dark sides. Especially, we should not conclude from this that without a dark side, the world would not be real, the world would not exist.

	Today, there are already enough dark sides in society. Be careful not to find any justification for their existence from here.

　　也谈月球的背面
    陆伟然
    读了２月１８日《大地》副刊登载的《月球的背面》一文，觉得意犹未尽，或有交叉，因此形成此文。
    从科学的眼光看来，月球的背面并不都是黑暗的世界。那里有黑暗也有光明。当我们看见一弯细细的月牙时，那背面正是大片的光明，许多时候，即月球正面以黑暗对着我们的时候，那背面则是全部的光明；这只要指出日食时我们所见的月球是黑色的便可知晓。
    阴暗面的存在，并非无损明月的清辉。月球背面的阴暗面，并不是静止的，不动的。那阴暗面时时在移动。圆月为什么会缺？就是因为阴暗面的存在并且移动的结果。阴暗面的存在，不仅是有损明月的光辉，而且最后势必将明月的光辉吞噬得一点不剩！下弦娥眉月的最后消失便是证明。
    所以对待阴暗面，第一是不能承认它是合法居民，必须造成人人抨击之势；第二是自己有了阴暗面，确实还得学学卢梭的自省，将其剥开来见见阳光，这样才能使阴暗处变成光明。否则，想让清辉无损，怎么可能呢？
    伟人或名人一如月球，也有我们看不见的背面。有的背面是阴暗的，指出其阴暗实为必要，不然，人物一伟大就容易变成神。有的背面本来就光明，一如日食时的月球背面，所以也不必非从背面找出阴暗不可。
    当月亮呈月牙形时，大部分光明是在月球背面。但我们往往忘记这点。是的，我们曾受过许多愚弄，把臭当成香，把黑当成白，也把本来大半是黑暗只有一窄溜光明的月球正面，当成全部是光明。这当中，自然有外部的原因，但也与我们面对黑暗却无视黑暗的存在、总以为黑暗是在月球背面有关。
    月球的背面确有阴暗，但这种阴暗需要分析。一种是由于阳光产生的反差，即阳光照耀时明亮，阳光离开时阴暗。这种阴暗系阳光所造成，非月球所固有。另一种是因月面构造所致。月球的背面有大量环形山，有嶙峋的岩石，有海（实际是平原）。由于月面构造的关系，有的地方即便在阳光下也呈现出阴影。
    如果说所有的伟人或名人都有月球的背面，都逃不出阴影，那么，这种阴影也需要分析。是固有的，非固有的？是缺点还是错误？是思想方法还是道德品质？是一般过失还是一种罪恶？如果不加区别，一律冠以“阴暗面”的名称，一律打家伙，岂不冤枉了清白无辜！
    我们不能因为月球的背面有时黑暗，就判定那儿永是黑暗世界，同样的，我们不能因为一些伟人或名人有某些阴暗面，就判定所有人必有见不得人的阴暗面。特别是不能因此而得出结论：没有阴暗面，世界便不真实，世界便不存在。
    今天，社会上的阴暗面已经够多了，当心再从这里找到什么合法存在的依据。
