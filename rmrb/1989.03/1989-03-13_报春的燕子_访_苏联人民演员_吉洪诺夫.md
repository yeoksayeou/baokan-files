The Herald of Spring – Interview with "People's Artist of the USSR" Gikhonov
Zhū Hànshēng

Is this Stirlitz from "Seventeen Moments of Spring"? When I went to the airport to greet Gikhonov, what I saw was an elderly man with white temples. Although he was tall, he was gentle and refined. Although he moved gracefully, he looked tired. He took off his hat, and I noticed that his hair was thinning. I couldn't help but sigh: this was far from the Stirlitz in my mind. Later, I learned that he was 61 years old, and "Seventeen Moments of Spring" was filmed in 1973. Time ages people!

After the banquet, Gikhonov rested a bit, combed his hair, and changed his clothes, appearing full of vigor. He spoke the following words in a poetic manner:

"When the first swallow appears, spring is also here. I am the first swallow to fly to the Chinese television industry. Here, I felt the warmth of spring. I never thought of, nor expected to be invited to this great and beautiful country of China. Many Soviet people yearn to know about China, to know about your television, films, and reforms. I am fortunate to be the first to arrive. I believe that after spring, there will surely be a beautiful and hot summer."

Gikhonov is like a flame, yet he is approachable and has none of the airs of a big star. He doesn't like to talk much, always so calm and composed, just like his name (Gikhonov in Russian means quiet). But once he gets interested in a topic, his eyes light up, and he talks endlessly. While accompanying him on a tour of the Great Wall, he talked about his family. He said, his wife teaches French at a college, and his daughter Anna is a fourth-year student at the National Film Academy, "Unfortunately, she has already started filming."

Why "unfortunately," what's the reason?

Gikhonov seemed a bit excited: "Now the competition in the film industry is very fierce. Once a director chooses you, you have to start filming immediately, without any thorough preparation, without time to familiarize yourself with the role, to experience the character's thoughts and feelings..."

"This is the market economy at work, right!" I said.

He refuted: "Then where is the art?"

I asked him how he approaches filming. He replied that playing a new role is always a challenge for him. He hates repetition and always seeks new and unique ways to portray each role. Therefore, he never easily accepts a role and refuses to film several movies at the same time. Only when he truly grasps the inner qualities of the character can he enter the creative process.

"So, are you satisfied with the roles you have created?" He didn't answer directly: "Art has no end."

Looking at this old actor's demeanor, I suddenly realized that his honors, including the title of "People's Artist of the USSR," Lenin Prize, State Prize winner, and "Hero of Socialist Labor," were indeed hard-earned.

I told him that Chinese audiences love "Seventeen Moments of Spring," especially his portrayal of Stirlitz. He pondered for a moment: "This is not a spy film. Because the plot lacks traditional elements such as fighting, murder, car chases, and gunfights. Stirlitz is not a superman; he is just a kind, clever, and brave person. He lives a very difficult life, often missing his family, but for his country and the anti-fascist war, he makes sacrifices, which is why he wins the love of the people. The tension and suspense of the plot come from showing how Stirlitz, in a complex and difficult environment, calmly faces reality and uses his wisdom and strength to attract the audience. Perhaps, this is the key to its success."

　　报春的燕子
    ——访“苏联人民演员”吉洪诺夫
    朱汉生
    难道这是《春天的十七个瞬间》中的施季利斯吗？我在机场出口迎接吉洪诺夫的时候，看到的却是一位两鬓苍白的老人，虽然身躯高大，但文质彬彬，虽然举止潇洒，但神情疲惫。他摘下礼帽，我发现他已经毛发稀疏。我忍不住叹息：这和我心目中的施季利斯相去甚远。后来我知道，他今年６１岁，《春天的十七个瞬间》是１９７３年拍摄的。岁月催人老啊！
    晚宴后，吉洪诺夫稍事休息，梳洗更衣，又显得生气勃勃。他用充满诗意的语言讲了下面一段话：
    “当第一只燕子出现时，春天也就来了。我就是第一只飞到中国电视界的燕子。在这里，我感到了春天般的温暖。我没想过，也没有料到会被邀请来到中国这个伟大而美丽的国家。许多苏联人渴望了解中国，想知道你们的电视、电影、改革怎么样。我幸运能捷足先登。我相信，春天过去之后，必将是一个美好而热烈的夏天。”
    吉洪诺夫像一团火，然而平易近人，丝毫没有大明星的架子。他不大喜欢讲话，总是那么沉稳，平静，就像他的名字（吉洪诺夫俄文是安静的意思）。可他一旦对某个问题发生兴趣，眼睛骤然一亮，便滔滔不绝。在陪他游览长城的途中，他讲起他的家庭。他说，妻子在一所学院教法文，女儿安娜是国立电影学院四年级的学生，“可惜已经开始拍片”。
    怎么“可惜”，什么缘故？
    吉洪诺夫显得有点激动：“现在电影界的竞争十分残酷。导演选中了你，就要你马上拍片，根本不让你做周密的准备工作，不给你时间熟悉角色，体验人物的思想感情……”
    “这是商品经济在起作用吧！”我说。
    他反驳：“那么，艺术在哪儿呢？”
    我问他怎么对待拍片。他回答说，每扮演一个新角色，于他都是难题。他讨厌重复，总是力求在每个角色中找到新的、独特的表现方法。所以他从不轻易接受一个角色，拒绝同时拍几部片子。只有真正把握了人物的内在气质，才可能进入创造过程。
    “那么，您对自己创造的角色满意吗？”他未置可否：“艺无止境”。
    看着这位老演员的神态，我忽然体会到，他连获“苏联人民演员”、列宁奖金和国家奖金获得者、“社会主义劳动英雄”的殊荣，确实来之不易。
    我告诉他，中国观众非常喜欢《春天的十七个瞬间》，尤其是他扮演的施季利斯。他寻思片刻：“这不是一部间谍片。因为剧中没有传统题材的特征，如打斗、谋杀、汽车追逐和枪战。施季利斯也不是超人，他只不过是一个善良、机智而勇敢的人，他生活得十分艰难，常常怀念自己的亲人，但是为了祖国和反法西斯战争，他作出牺牲，才赢得人们的喜爱。情节的紧张和悬念，是靠表现施季利斯如何在复杂困难的环境下，冷静地对待现实，发挥自己的才智和力量去吸引观众的。也许，这就是它的成功之处。”
