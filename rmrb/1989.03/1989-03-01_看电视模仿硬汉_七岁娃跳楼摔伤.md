    A seven-year-old child was critically injured after jumping from a fourth-floor window while imitating a character from a Japanese television show. The incident occurred around 8 AM on February 14 in a residential building on Haichang Road, Haishu Town, Haining City, Zhejiang Province.

    The child, surnamed Luo, lives on the fourth floor. He had been watching the Japanese television series "Koseidon" for several days and became fascinated by it. On the day of the incident, his parents were out, leaving him alone at home. Out of boredom, he decided to mimic the jumping action of the "Koseidon" team members and climbed onto the window sill, jumping out.

    Thanks to the hospital's emergency treatment, the child's life was saved.

　　看电视模仿硬汉　七岁娃跳楼摔伤
    本报讯今年２月１４日上午８时许，浙江省海宁市硖石镇海昌路一幢宿舍楼，出现了一幕险情：一个７岁儿童从４楼窗口跳下，当场摔得不省人事。
    小孩姓罗，家住４楼。他连续几天看了日本电视剧《恐龙特急克塞号》后入了迷。这天他的父母都外出了，只有他一人在家。无聊中，他想起“克塞队员”的跳楼动作，便想模仿，于是爬上窗口跳下。
    经医院全力抢救，这小孩才幸免一死。（章德春）
