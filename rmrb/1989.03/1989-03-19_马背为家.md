Located in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, Easter Island, famous for its giant stone statues, has a current population of about 2,000 people, with fewer than 500 being indigenous. However, the island is home to over 5,000 horses, meaning there are 1.5 horses per person.

Here, fetuses receive "prenatal education" in their mothers' wombs while on horseback, and many infants are born just minutes after being on horseback. As soon as children learn to walk, their parents and siblings help them onto a horse. The horseback becomes the children's "playground," and everywhere you look, there are genuine horseback schools. Courtship and marriage are determined by horsemanship; weddings involve the gift of horses; and funerals use horses as transportation.

　　马背为家
    位于东南太平洋中以巨人石像闻名的智利复活节岛现有居民约为２０００人，其中土著已不足５００人。但岛上各种马儿却多达５０００余匹，人均有马１．５匹。
    这里的胎儿，随母腹在马背上“胎教”，不少婴儿诞生前几十分钟还在马背上“徜徉”，幼儿刚刚学步，父母兄姊就扶他（她）上马，马背成为孩子们的“乐园”，到处是名副其实的马背学校。求偶择婚，以马术定终身；婚嫁迎娶，以马匹为馈赠；出殡送葬，由马匹作运载工具。
