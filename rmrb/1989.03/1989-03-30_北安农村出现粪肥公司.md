A manure fertilizer company has emerged in the rural areas of Beian. The People's Daily, Harbin, March 29th - Before the spring plowing season, the rural areas of Beian City in Heilongjiang Province have universally established manure fertilizer companies and specialized manure accumulation households.

This city had previously formulated a soil improvement fund method, stipulating that each year, 5 yuan per mu (a unit of area) of soil improvement fund should be collected, with each household responsible for accumulating manure on their own. Every two years, 1,500 kilograms of manure per mu should be applied. Those who complete the task will have their soil improvement fund returned; those who do not complete the task will use the fund to purchase manure. They have successively established a number of manure fertilizer companies and specialized households, realizing the commodification of manure, and ensuring the implementation of the soil improvement fund system.

　　北安农村出现粪肥公司
    本报哈尔滨３月２９日电  黑龙江省北安市农村春耕前普遍建立粪肥公司和积肥专业户。
    这个市曾制订养地基金办法，规定每年每亩地收养地基金５元，以农户为单位自行积肥，两年一茬，亩施肥１５００公斤。完成任务的，养地基金退还；完不成任务的，用基金买粪。他们陆续建立起一批粪肥公司和专业户，实现粪肥商品化，保证了养地基金制的落实。
