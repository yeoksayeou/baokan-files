North and South Korean Sports Delegations Hold Talks

NEW DELHI, March 9 (Xinhua) — (Reporter Zhu Kechuan) The North and South Korean sports delegations held talks today in the morning at the "Peace House" on the South side of Panmunjom. They discussed the issue of forming a unified team to participate in the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing and reached partial agreements on some issues.

Today's talks were conducted in a relatively calm atmosphere. The North Korean delegation, led by Vice Chairman Kim Hyong-jin of the Korean Olympic Committee, and the South Korean delegation, represented by Vice Chairman Chang Chung-jik of the South Korean Olympic Committee, each presented their proposals for forming a unified team. Both sides expressed their hope to participate in the 11th Asian Games as a unified Korean team and agreed unanimously to use the traditional Korean folk song "Arirang" as the team's anthem. They also reached partial agreements on the issue of the unified team's flag. However, they did not reach a consensus on the name of the unified team. Regarding the selection of athletes and the formation of the team, due to significant differences between the two sides, these issues were not discussed today.

　　朝鲜北南双方体育代表团举行会谈
    新华社板门店３月９日电  （记者朱克川）朝鲜北方和南方代表今天上午在板门店南方一侧的“和平之家”举行会谈，讨论统一组队参加１９９０年在北京举行的第十一届亚运会问题，并就部分问题达成了协议。
    今天的会谈是在比较平静的气氛中进行的。以朝鲜奥委会副委员长金亨镇为团长的北方代表团和以南朝鲜奥委会副委员长张忠植为代表的南方代表团分别就统一组队的问题提出了各自的方案。双方都表示希望以民族统一队参加第十一届亚运会，一致同意以朝鲜民族的传统民谣《阿里郎》作为统一队的队歌。在统一队的队旗问题上也达成了部分协议。但是，在统一队的名称问题上双方没有取得一致意见，在关于如何选拔参赛运动员和如何组队问题上，由于双方分歧较大，今天没有就此进行讨论。
