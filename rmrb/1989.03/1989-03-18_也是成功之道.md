In the past, Europeans and Americans, who prided themselves on their creativity and boasted numerous Nobel laureates, often looked down on the Japanese businessmen who frequently visited their companies with cameras and notebooks. However, when Japanese products flooded the global market, Europeans and Americans finally realized: these Japanese were indeed reaping the fruits of their intellectual labor.

Japan's basic theoretical research is relatively weak, which naturally hinders the further development of science and technology. However, the Japanese found a shortcut—sending outstanding technical personnel to the production sites and involving them in the direct production process. This not only helps in absorbing and developing new technologies but, more importantly, shortens the cycle from research to production to commercialization. This allows Japan to commercialize new ideas before Europe and America.

Therefore, although the ratio of technical personnel to population in Japan is lower than in European and American countries, due to its more effective utilization of technical personnel, the labor productivity is higher than in European and American countries. This is probably also an important factor in Japan's economic success.

　　也是成功之道
    过去，自诩富有创造力、拥有众多诺贝尔奖得主的欧美人，对那些带着照相机和笔记本频繁出入于欧美大公司的日本商人常常是不屑一顾的；而今天，当日本商品大量涌入世界市场时，欧美人才翻然醒悟：原来这些日本人在收获他们的脑力劳动的成果。
    日本的基础理论研究比较薄弱，这自然会阻碍科学技术的进一步发展。但日本人想出了一条捷径——让优秀的科技人员到生产现场、参与直接的生产过程。这样做不仅有助于吸收、发展新技术，更重要的是缩短了科研—生产—商品的周期。这样日本就能够抢在欧美之前把新的设想商业化。
    因此，尽管日本的科技人员与人口的比例低于欧美国家，但是，由于它能更有效地发挥科技人员的作用，所以，劳动生产率却高于欧美国家，这大概也是日本经济成功的一个重要因素。
