Outstanding artists belong to the era, and to future history, but first and foremost, they belong to the era, shaped by it, and acting in response to it.

Cai Chusheng is undoubtedly such a film artist. This beloved artist of the people came from the early 20th century, when the nation was in decline, and departed sadly in the 1960s during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. One could say his life was filled with hardships, born in turmoil and dying in turmoil. His enduring legacy lies in being a son nurtured by the era, dedicating his entire energy and blood to his mother. Throughout his life, he left us 14 films and scripts rich in the characteristics of the times. Among them, "Morning of a Metropolis," "Fisherman's Song," "New Woman," "Lost Lambs," "The Spring River Flows East," and "Tide of the South China Sea" are his representative masterpieces. These films not only have a strong and moving life force, breaking away from stale conventions artistically, but also, with their fresh themes, solemn social indictments, passionate love and hate, and advocacy for the broad masses of the lower classes, they have won widespread acclaim. Some were shown for dozens of days and months without waning popularity, even Nationalist newspapers described them as "causing a sensation" and "empty streets." "Fisherman's Song" was the first Chinese film to win an award at the Moscow International Film Festival. These are works that have stood the test of history. Along with the artists who formed the first brilliant period of Chinese cinema in the 1930s, Cai Chusheng marked a turning point in film history, opening up a new era of early Chinese realistic cinema and merging into the tide of the times.

Cai Chusheng devoted himself to film art during the stormy and difficult years. Whether to devote himself to art or join the ranks of the national democratic revolution was a question that Cai Chusheng and his contemporaries had to face. Art is originally a way of human existence; it necessarily changes with the change of human existence. Joining the revolution was also an active way of existence adopted out of necessity. Cai Chusheng chose both film art and revolution, consciously serving the era's demands with his film work, walking the common path of Chinese revolutionary cultural workers.

The era of blood and fire is a crucible, a school, and a ladder to progress. The era gave Cai Chusheng not only bitterness and limitations but also gave a great artist ambition, nourishment, and tempering. In 1932, he began independently directing his first film, "Spring in the South," a tragic love story of young men and women with anti-feudal elements. As the author said, the work wanted to "infuse some small-bourgeois aesthetic charm and poetic dreams." Society also had some praise for the author's talent, but ultimately, because it detached itself from the current reality struggle, it was criticized by left-wing public opinion. He then made "Pink Dream," which again constructed a "dream" far removed from reality, and was met with even sharper criticism. The sharpness of the criticism came from the eagerness of the expectations. He placed himself on the scale of the era and felt a sense of loss. In front of his friends, he made a resolute vow: "I am still young. As long as I do not die, I will make greater efforts to repay your expectations!" Indeed, he saw the light and, in an essay titled "Morning Light," expressed his feelings. He called the past an "evil dream" and announced that he would face the morning light and begin a new future. Thus, from 1933 to 1937, he consecutively directed "Morning of a Metropolis," "Fisherman's Song," "New Woman," and "Lost Lambs," participated in the production of "Lianhua Symphony," and wrote short plays "Fighting for Freedom" and "Little Five Heroes." After Shanghai fell, he moved to Hong Kong and continued to direct "Paradise in the Island," "Bright Future," and collaborated on "Blood on the Mountain City" and "March of the Guerrillas." This was his most prolific period. He firmly believed that "losing social value means no art exists." At the same time, he strove to maintain the artist's tenacious pursuit and free spirit. He placed his foundation on creating true art, tenaciously guarding his independent artistic character, not yielding to or succumbing to the pressure of vulgar sociological views. He worked hard to find the intersection of the film's artistic (spectacle) and social (political) aspects, while seeking the sensory form of the work to make it easily accepted by the audience. He said: "I decide that my future works, at the very least, must reflect the suffering of the lower classes and make them (the works) as close as possible to the masses." He insisted that since he had "escaped the ivory tower," he might as well "be a wandering rebel"! These views published in 1936 neither agreed with the commercial film views rampant in the market at the time nor sought agreement with certain dogmatic "social value" theorists and self-righteous art theorists. In fact, it was a popular declaration of early Chinese realistic cinema. It was Cai Chusheng and his contemporaries' experience in unifying revolutionary goals, art, and audience, which had matured. This artistic trend and style continued into the late 1940s. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he wandered between Guilin and Chongqing until the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. After years of inactivity, in 1947, he released the epic "The Spring River Flows East," with its long-accumulated exuberance and mastery of technique, standing as the pinnacle of early Chinese realistic cinema. This grand tragedy of social ethics on the eve of the collapse of the old society, its social content, its emotional power, and its watchability can be said to have reached the pinnacle of Cai Chusheng's artistic advocacy. No wonder a Nationalist official at the time lamented that this film, once released, caused the Nationalists to lose half their territory! It was evident how it shook people's hearts.

In the last 20 years of his life, the only film he shot, "Tide of the South China Sea," took three years to complete the first part, seemingly not very smooth. Someone jokingly called it a "long-blooming flower" among the "hundred flowers." This was because at the time, the clouds of "class struggle" were gathering, and the rain was about to come. His creative thoughts could not help but be affected, causing the artistic achievement of the work to be obviously inferior to the heights he had previously reached.

### 杰出的艺术家属于时代

　　杰出的艺术家属于时代
    杰出的艺术家是属于时代的，也是属于未来历史的，但首先是属于时代的，为时代所造就，应时代而作为的。
    蔡楚生，无疑也是这样的一位电影艺术家。这位为人民所钟爱的艺术家，从本世纪初的国运日蹙中来，而在６０年代的那场浩劫中凄然离去，可以说坎坷一生，生于忧患而复死于忧患了。他的不殁生命，在于他是时代养育的儿子，而把它的全部心力和鲜血献给了母亲。他一生中为我们留下了１４部富有时代特色的电影和剧本。其中《都会的早晨》《渔光曲》《新女性》《迷途的羔羊》《一江春水向东流》《南海潮》均是他的代表性力作。这些影片不仅生活气息浓郁，动人，艺术上力破陈腐，而且以其新鲜的题材，庄严的社会控诉，炽热的爱憎和为广大下层人民代言，博得广泛的欢迎，有的连映数十天数月盛况不衰，连国民党的报纸也以“引起轰动”“万人空巷”来形容。《渔光曲》还破天荒第一次代表中国在莫斯科国际电影节上获奖。它们是经得起历史检验的传世之作。蔡楚生同形成３０年代中国电影第一个灿烂花期的艺术家们一起，给电影史划出一道分水岭，从此开辟了中国早期现实主义电影的一代新风，汇入时代潮流中。
    蔡楚生献身电影艺术，正是风雨如晦、国难深重的年代。是潜心艺术，还是投入到民族民主革命的行列中，是蔡楚生和他的同时代人所必定要面对的问题。艺术原本是人的一种生存方式，它必然依人的生存环境的改变而发生变化，而投身革命，也是被迫采取的一种积极的生存方式。蔡楚生既选择了电影艺术，又选择了革命，他自觉地将电影工作服务于时代的要求，走上中国革命文艺工作者的共同道路。
    血与火的时代是熔炉，是学校，是进步的阶梯。时代给予蔡楚生的不仅仅是苦楚和局限，而且给了一个杰出艺术家以抱负、滋养和锤炼。他１９３２年开始独立拍摄第一部影片《南国之春》，这是青年男女的恋爱悲剧，寓有反封建的成份，按作者的说法，作品要“渗进一些小资产阶级趣味的优美的抒情，诗般的梦幻。”社会上对作者的才能也不无赞赏，但终因其脱离当前的现实斗争而受到左翼舆论的批评。他接着拍了《粉红色的梦》又因其再一次构筑了一个远离现实的“梦幻”，而招致了更为尖锐的批评。批评的尖锐，实出于期望的殷切。他将自己放到时代的戥盘上，内心感到了失重。他在朋友面前投下铿锵的誓言：“我还年轻，只要不死，我会以更大的努力来报答你们的期望的！”果然他豁然开朗，在一篇题名《朝光》的散文中抒发了自己的感情，他把过去称作“恶梦”，宣布将迎着朝光开始一个新的未来。于是自１９３３至１９３７年间，他连续拍摄了《都会的早晨》《渔光曲》《新女性》和《迷途的羔羊》，参加摄制了《联华交响曲》，写作了短剧《为自由而战》《小五义》等。上海沦陷后，他转到香港，继续拍了《孤岛天堂》《前程万里》，合作完成了《血溅宝山城》《游击进行曲》。这是他创作的旺盛期。他坚定地“相信失掉了社会价值，就没有艺术的存在。”与此同时，努力保持艺术家的执著追求和自由心灵。他把基点放到创造真实的艺术品上，顽强地坚守独立的艺术品格，不去迎合或屈服于庸俗社会学的压力。尽力找到电影的艺术性（观赏性）同社会性（政治性）的结合点，同时寻求作品的感性形式，使之易于为观众接受。他说：“我决定我以后的作品，最低限度要做到反映下层社会的痛苦，尽可能地使她（作品）和广大的群众接触。”他坚持说：他既然已经“逃出了象牙塔”，倒不妨就“做一下子流寇”！这些发表在１９３６年的见解既不苟同于当时市场上泛滥的商业片观点，又不求同于某些教条式的“社会价值”论者和自鸣清高的艺术论者，实际上是中国早期现实主义电影的通俗宣言。它是蔡楚生和他的同代艺术家们将革命目标、艺术、观众三者统一的趋于成熟的经验总结。这种艺术倾向和风格，一直延续到４０年代末。太平洋战争爆发后，他流离转徙于桂林、重庆间，直至抗日战争胜利。在息影多年之后的１９４７年推出宏篇巨制《一江春水向东流》，以其蓄之既久的酣畅奋发和技巧风格的谙熟，耸然成为中国早期现实主义电影的峰巅。这个旧社会崩溃前夕的方生与未死之间的社会伦理大悲剧，它的社会内涵，它的动情力，它的可看性，可以说达到了蔡楚生艺术主张的极致。难怪当时的一位国民党人士感叹说，这部片子一上映，国民党便丢去了半壁江山！足见其力撼人心的威力。
    他在生命最后的２０年中拍摄的唯一影片《南海潮》，花了３年才完成上集，似乎并不得心应手，有人戏称是百花齐放的一朵“长花”。乃因其时“阶级斗争”的阴云四合，山雨欲来，他的创作思想不能不受到冲击，以致作品的艺术成就比起以往达到的高度来，显然地逊色了。
