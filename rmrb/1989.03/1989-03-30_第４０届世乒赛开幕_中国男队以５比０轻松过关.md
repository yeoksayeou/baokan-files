The largest-scale table tennis event in history—the 40th World Table Tennis Championships—opened at 23:30 Beijing time today in the Westphalia Hall in Dortmund, West Germany. Nearly 500 athletes from 78 table tennis associations across five continents entered the hall to the enthusiastic applause of nearly 10,000 spectators.

Dortmund Deputy Mayor Radag, West German Table Tennis Federation Chairman Geip, and International Table Tennis Federation Chairman Ogimura Ichiro each spoke at the opening ceremony, extending a warm welcome to the athletes from various countries. Willi Daumer, President of the West German National Olympic Committee, declared: The 40th World Table Tennis Championships are officially open. The opening ceremony featured a rich variety of performances by artists from various parts of West Germany.

The men's and women's team competitions of the 40th World Table Tennis Championships began simultaneously on 32 tables today. The Chinese men's team, in their first match against Madagascar, won 5-0. This match, originally scheduled to start at 9 AM, was delayed by three hours due to the Madagascar team's late arrival last night.

In this match, China fielded Chen Longcan along with two young players, Ma Wenge and Yu Shentong, all of whom won their respective matches 2-0.

The Swedish men's team, runners-up in the previous championships, also easily defeated Barbados 5-0 in their first match this morning. The third-place team from the previous championships, North Korea, the fourth-place team, Yugoslavia, and the Chinese Taipei team, among other seeded teams, also did not encounter much difficulty, each winning 5-0 against their opponents. The Chinese women's team does not have a match today and will face Norway and Macau tomorrow.

The team competitions will last for seven days. The men's team semifinals and the women's team finals will be held on April 3, and the men's team final will be held on April 4. Central Television will broadcast the live recordings of these key matches to the domestic audience.

    上届男团亚军瑞典队今天上午首战巴巴多斯队，也轻松地以５∶０过关，上届第三名朝鲜队、第四名南斯拉夫队以及中国台北队等种子队都没费什么气力，以５∶０战胜对手。中国女队今天没有比赛，明天出战挪威队和澳门队。
