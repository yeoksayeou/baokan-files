Gao Qinghai, a professor at the Philosophy Department of Jilin University, and Meng Xianzong, an associate professor, wrote in the February 4, 1989 issue of *Wen Hui Bao* that China's reform has gone through a decade of trials and tribulations, achieving remarkable results while also encountering numerous problems. The reasons for these problems are multifaceted. Facing this comprehensive and profound social transformation, we lack an overall grasp and have not conducted a comprehensive analysis from the perspective of social development theory. The absence of our own social development theory to guide reform practices is one of the important reasons.

Over the past decade of reform, we have had an economic development strategy but lacked a social development strategy. Most reform ideas have focused on economic system reform. In the course of reform, issues such as environmental damage, reckless investment, collusion between officials and businessmen, postponement of education and culture, neglect of human development, and the pursuit of rapid economic growth at the expense of other factors have emerged. All of this indicates that the guiding principle behind people's actions is a reform approach of "pure economic advancement and economic determinism." Based on the current reform practices and the problems that have arisen, China's reform has reached a point where it needs to break away from this approach. We should transition from pure economic advancement to harmonious social development. This is the new reform approach we should explore. Reform practices have enlightened us: we should base the economic system reform on China's own social development theory, strengthen the awareness of development, and use development to regulate reform. These insights boil down to one point: the construction of China's own social development theory.

　　高清海、孟宪忠提出：
    中国需要自己的社会发展理论
    吉林大学哲学系教授高清海、副教授孟宪忠在一九八九年二月四日《文汇报》撰文认为，中国改革一路风雨走过了十年，成绩举世瞩目，也遇到不少问题。出现问题的原因是多方面的。面对改革这一全面深刻的社会变革，我们缺乏整体把握，没能从社会发展理论角度对其进行全面分析，没有建设我们自己的社会发展理论以指导改革实践，是重要原因之一。
    十年改革，我们只有经济发展战略没有社会发展战略，众多改革思路都是以经济体制改革为内容。改革实践中，损害环境、疯狂投入、官商结合、推迟文教、忽视人的发展、片面追求经济高速增长，这一切说明支配人们行动的是“单纯经济突进、单纯经济决定论”的改革思路。根据我国今天改革实践及暴露出来的问题，中国改革已到了走出这种思路的时候了。从单纯的经济突进走向和谐的社会发展，这是我们应探索的改革新思路。改革实践启迪我们，应该把经济体制改革的思路奠定在中国自己的社会发展理论的基础之上，应该强化发展意识，以发展规范改革。这些认识集中到一点，即建设中国自己的社会发展理论。
