Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th. - In 1988, the total number of hospital beds in the country reached over 2.5 million, an increase of nearly 100,000 beds compared to 1987, marking the second consecutive year of high growth. Health officials from various provinces and municipalities, currently gathered in Beijing, believe that this rapid growth rate is not necessarily a good thing. It has led to overcrowded wards, a shortage of medical staff, and a decline in management and service quality. The officials also pointed out that in the past two years, hospitals have expanded their services by squeezing administrative offices or renting additional space to increase the number of beds. This has resulted in a significant increase in hospital beds outside of new construction and expansion projects. However, other supporting measures have not kept pace, causing many new problems.

　　全国去年添病床十万张
    卫生界为配套措施担忧
    本报北京３月１０日讯  记者艾笑报道：１９８８年，全国医院床位已达２５０万多张，比１９８７年增加近１０万张，成为连续增长的第二个高峰年。正在北京集会的各省市卫生厅局长们认为，这种过快的增长速度，并非好事，造成了病房拥挤、医务人员缺乏和管理质量、服务质量下降。与会厅局长们还指出，近两年由于医院扩大服务，无限地挖潜或挤占行政办公用房，租借房屋增加病床，使新建、扩建以外的医院床位猛增，而其它措施又不能配套跟上，带来许多新的麻烦。
