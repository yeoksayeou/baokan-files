The fourth plenary session of the Seventh National People's Congress was held this morning in the Great Hall of the People, where reports from the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate were heard.

The session was presided over by Alpu Jinmei, a standing member of the Presidium of the Seventh National People's Congress.

In his work report, Zhang Jianxin, President of the Supreme People's Court, briefed the deputies on the work of the people's courts at all levels in handling criminal, civil, economic, maritime, administrative cases, and in dealing with complaints and appeals, as well as on the reform and construction of the courts themselves.

Zhang Jianxin said that over the past year, the courts across the country have achieved certain successes in their adjudication work, and significant progress has been made in the reform and construction of the courts. However, there are also some shortcomings in the work of the Supreme People's Court: First, the investigation and research into the new situations and problems facing the courts nationwide are not deep and systematic enough, and the macro guidance of the court work needs to be further strengthened; second, the supervision and inspection of the adjudication work of the lower courts are not sufficient, and the quality and efficiency of case handling need to be further improved; third, the political and ideological education of the court cadres is not strong enough, and some disciplinary laxness and sluggish work styles among the staff need to be further managed and educated. We will resolutely take effective measures to correct these issues.

Liu Fuzhi, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, reported to the session on the work of combating bribery and embezzlement crimes, criminal offenses, cases infringing upon citizens' democratic rights, and the enforcement situation and team building over the past year.

Liu Fuzhi said that overall, the quality of the procuratorial team is good, the enforcement of laws and the performance of legal supervision duties are serious, and the broad procuratorial personnel work diligently, with improved enforcement levels and case handling quality, contributing to the maintenance of the dignity of national law. However, there are also many issues that cannot be ignored: some cases have inappropriate application of laws and incorrect classification; the situation of exceeding case handling deadlines is prominent; among some procuratorial personnel, there are serious illegal and criminal behaviors such as favoritism, bribery, bullying, and beating the masses; some procuratorial agencies' leaders cannot uphold the principle of equality before the law, and some even abandon the enforcement stance, lacking the courage to independently exercise procuratorial power in accordance with the law.

The session's presiding officers also included Peng Chong, Yan Jizi, Liao Hansheng, Fei Xiaotong, Wang Guangzhong, Wang Guangyu, Ye Gongqi, Liu Fusheng, Xu Shijie, Li Zhen, Li Guiying, Amudun Niya, Jia Zhijie, and Guo Zhi.

　　人大会议举行第四次大会        
    听取最高人民法院、最高人民检察院工作报告
    据新华社北京３月２９日电  （记者何平）七届全国人大二次会议今天上午在人民大会堂举行第四次大会，听取最高人民法院、最高人民检察院的工作报告。
    大会执行主席、主席团常务主席阿沛·阿旺晋美主持会议。
    最高人民法院院长任建新在工作报告中，向代表们汇报了全国各级人民法院开展刑事审判、民事审判、经济审判、海事审判、行政审判和处理告诉、申诉工作及法院自身改革、建设的工作情况。
    任建新说，一年来，全国法院的审判工作取得了一定成绩，法院自身的改革和建设也取得了明显进展。同时，最高人民法院在工作中还存在一些缺点，一是对全国法院工作面临的新情况、新问题调查研究不够深入、系统，对法院工作的宏观指导需要进一步加强；二是对下级法院审判工作的监督、检查不够，办案的质量和效率还要进一步提高；三是对法院干部队伍的政治思想教育抓得不够有力，对一些干警中存在的纪律松弛、作风拖拉的现象，亟需进一步加强管理和教育。我们将坚决采取有效措施，努力改正。
    最高人民检察院检察长刘复之就一年来打击贪污、受贿犯罪，打击刑事犯罪，查处侵犯公民民主权利案件，执法情况与队伍建设的有关情况，向大会作了汇报。
    刘复之说，从总的方面看，检察队伍的素质是好的，执行法律、履行法律监督职责是严肃的，广大检察人员勤奋工作，执法水平和办案质量有所提高，为维护国家法制的尊严作出了贡献。但是，我们的工作也存在不少不容忽视的问题：少数案件适用法律不当，定性不准；超过办案期限情况比较突出；在少数检察人员中发生徇私舞弊、收受贿赂、耍威风、打骂群众等严重违法乱纪和犯罪行为；个别检察院的领导不能坚持公民在法律面前一律平等的原则，有的甚至放弃执法立场，缺乏依法独立行使检察权的勇气。
    今天的大会执行主席还有彭冲、严济慈、廖汉生、费孝通、王光中、王光宇、叶公琦、刘夫生、许士杰、李振、李桂英、阿木冬·尼牙孜、贾志杰、郭志。
