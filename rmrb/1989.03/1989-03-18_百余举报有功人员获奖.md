Over 100 informants who have made significant contributions have received awards. According to a report from our newspaper, since the nationwide people's procuratorates began their informant work, procuratorates in 15 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Sichuan, and Shanxi, have successively awarded 110 informants who have made significant contributions, distributing a total of over 32,000 yuan in prize money.

In the face of severe financial difficulties, procuratorates in various regions have consulted with financial departments to allocate special funds as rewards for informants. To ensure the personal safety of informants and respect their personal wishes, various regions have adopted methods such as small-scale or individual meetings to promptly commend and reward informants who have made significant contributions.

　　百余举报有功人员获奖
    本报讯  全国各级人民检察机关开展举报工作以来，北京、天津、上海、四川、山西等１５个省、市和自治区检察机关先后奖励了１１０名举报有功人员，颁发奖金３．２万余元。
    在国家经费非常困难的情况下，各地检察机关同财政部门商量，拨出专款，作为奖励举报人员的经费。为保障举报人员的人身安全和尊重举报人员的本人意愿，各地均采取小范围或个别见面的方式，及时对举报有功人员进行了表彰和奖励。
