At 2:30 PM on March 20, Representative of the PLA delegation and Deputy Political Commissar of the Jinan Military Region, Major General Cai Hongshan, was resting at a round table in the north hall of the Great Hall of the People. A young man quickly approached and handed Major General Cai a business card, saying, "I am a reporter from the Taiwan 'United Daily News.' Can we have a chat?"

The general stood up and took the card, learning that the young man's name was Wang Zhenbang. He smiled pleasantly and said, "Nice to meet you. We can talk."

The two discussed the issue of national reunification. Wang, the reporter, said, "Personally, I fully agree with the reunification of China, but there is a question of the right time and conditions."

The general took up the topic and said, "I understand. China is a large country, and if it remains divided for a long time, it will be unfavorable internationally and against the wishes of the people of the entire nation."

"Right! Right!" The Taiwanese reporter, shaking the general's hand, repeatedly said, "Thank you! Thank you! Goodbye!"

　　台湾记者访将军
    ３月２０日下午２时３０分，解放军代表团代表、济南军区政治部副主任蔡红山少将在人大会堂大厅北部一张圆桌旁小憩，一位男青年快步走了过来，向蔡红山代表递上一张名片说：“我是台湾《联合报》记者，咱们可以谈谈吗？”
    将军起身接过名片，得知他叫王震邦，愉快地笑道：“认识你很高兴，可以谈谈！”
    俩人谈到祖国统一问题。王记者说：“就我个人来说，完全同意中国实现统一大业，但是，有个适当时机和适当条件的问题。”
    将军接过话茬说：“我很理解。我们中国是个大国，如果长期处于分裂状态在国际上是不利的，也有违全国人民的心愿。”“对！对！”台湾记者握着将军的手，连声说：“谢谢！谢谢！再见！”
