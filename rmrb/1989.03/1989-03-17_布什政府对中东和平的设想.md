During Israeli Foreign Minister Arens' visit to the United States, the U.S. government presented its vision for a Middle East peace plan. American public opinion believes that the Bush administration's first high-level talks with Israel indicate that the U.S. is ready to take new steps on the Middle East issue.

The Bush administration is proposing its Middle East peace vision under new circumstances. Over the past half-year, the situation in the Middle East has undergone significant changes, but the U.S. was in a transitional period between old and new presidents and temporarily could not prioritize the Middle East issue, resulting in delayed actions. Additionally, the Israeli government's refusal to compromise and the continued tension in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for 15 months without relief have caused the peace process to stall. Meanwhile, the Palestine Liberation Organization has adjusted its policies and taken new actions, while the international community and Western European countries are eagerly hoping for a turnaround in Middle East peace. The Soviet Union has also been actively engaged in diplomatic activities in the Middle East. The active international environment has forced the U.S. to consider countermeasures and act quickly to avoid being passive repeatedly.

From the information currently available, the U.S. has a general vision of a "two-stage" peace process, with the following main points: First, Israel and the PLO take separate actions to ease the situation in the Israeli-occupied areas, while beginning discussions on the next step of the "final solution," ensuring Israel's security requirements and fulfilling the Palestinian people's desire for national self-determination. U.S. officials also emphasized that both Israel and the Palestinians must take on some responsibility for the final resolution of the Middle East issue, making Arab countries feel that the U.S.'s actions are not limited to easing tensions and ending the Palestinian resistance but are aimed at improving the local atmosphere through practical steps. From this perspective, the Bush administration seems to want to indicate that its approach is different from that of the previous administration.

However, currently, the focus of the U.S. peace vision is on easing tensions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Recently, the U.S. has drafted some specific steps for both Israel and the Palestinians to implement. It is said that during the talks, the U.S. proposed to Israel the release of some Palestinians arrested during the resistance struggle, the cessation or restriction of administrative detention of Palestinians, and the reopening of schools in the occupied areas, among other measures. Regarding the PLO, the U.S. plans to have Ambassador Pellettreau begin formal talks in Tunis with PLO representatives, requiring the PLO to make concessions to Israel, including stopping violent demonstrations and strikes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, stopping attacks on Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, and stopping the distribution of leaflets. The U.S. believes that only in this way can it promote direct negotiations between Israel and the PLO, and the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Critics of these plans argue that the steps impose more demands on the PLO than on Israel, showing bias; but some U.S. newspapers believe that the U.S. is using its deep relationship with Israel and the favorable conditions of U.S.-Palestinian dialogue to facilitate some form of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which is still a positive move.

However, looking at the long term, the U.S.'s current vision for achieving lasting peace in the Middle East is still more of a conceptual framework. For example, regarding the negotiation methods for the Middle East issue, the U.S.'s current policy is to promote direct negotiations and believes that the conditions for convening a Middle East conference are not yet in place, but it does not rule out the possibility of holding an international conference. The U.S. also believes that perhaps one day, Middle East peace will depend on direct negotiations between Israel and the PLO. It can be seen that the U.S. is taking a step-by-step approach.

The U.S.'s above vision first encountered criticism from Israel. Israeli Foreign Minister Arens, during his visit to Washington, stated that despite changes in the Middle East over the past few months, the Shamir government will not retreat from its original position. It seems that if the U.S. wants to achieve something on the Middle East issue, it still needs to push Israel to change its attitude.

### 布什政府对中东和平的设想

　　布什政府对中东和平的设想
    本报记者  张启昕
    以色列外长阿伦斯访美期间，美国政府提出了对中东和平计划的设想。美国舆论认为，布什政府同以色列举行的第一次高级会谈表明，美国准备在中东问题上迈开新的步伐。
    布什政府是在新的形势下提出自己的中东和平设想的。近半年来，中东局势发生了重大变化，但美国处于新旧总统的过渡时期，一时未能把中东问题摆上日程，行动显得迟缓，加之以色列政府拒绝和解，西岸和加沙地带的紧张局势持续１５个月而未缓解，和平进程停滞不前。与此同时，由于巴勒斯坦解放组织调整政策，采取了新的行动，国际社会以及西欧国家迫切希望中东和平出现转机，苏联也在中东地区积极开展了外交活动。活跃的国际环境迫使美国考虑对策，迅速行动，避免一再被动。
    从目前透露的情况看，美国对中东和平的大体设想是“两阶段”和平进程，其大体内容是：先由以色列和巴解组织分别采取行动，缓和以色列占领区的局势，同时开始讨论下一步“最后解决方案”，既保证以色列的安全要求，又满足巴勒斯坦人实现民族自决的愿望。美国官员还强调，以巴双方必须对中东问题的最后解决承担某种义务，使阿拉伯国家感到美国的做法不仅仅限于缓和紧张局势、结束巴勒斯坦人的反抗斗争，而是要通过采取实际步骤，改善当地的气氛，从这点看，布什政府似乎要表明它的做法与前任政府有所不同。
    然而，在当前，美国和平设想的重点是在缓和西岸和加沙地带的紧张局势上。最近一个时期，美国拟订了一些具体步骤，要求以、巴双方实行。据说，美国在会谈中向以色列提出释放部分在反抗斗争中被逮捕的巴勒斯坦人，停止或限制对巴勒斯坦人实行行政拘留手段，重新开放被占领区的学校，等等。对于巴解组织，美国的打算是由佩莱特鲁大使在突尼斯与巴解代表开始正式会谈，要求巴解对以色列作出让步，包括在西岸和加沙地带停止暴力示威和罢工，停止对黎巴嫩南部以军的袭击，停止散发传单。美国认为，这样才有可能促使以色列与巴解、西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦人进行直接谈判。对于美国的这些打算，批评者认为，这些步骤对巴解的要求多于以色列，偏袒一方；但美国有的报纸认为，美国利用美以深远关系和美巴对话的有利条件，促成某种以巴谈判，还是可取的。
    但从长远看，目前美国对如何实现中东的持久和平，更多的停留在某些原则的设想上。譬如说中东问题的谈判方式，美国目前的政策仍然是促进直接谈判，并认为现在还不具备召开中东和会的条件，但是并不排除召开国际会议的可能性。美国还认为，或许有一天，中东和平有待以色列与巴解的直接谈判。可以看出，美国是采取走一步看一步的态度。
    美国的上述设想首先遇到了来自以色列的责难。以色列外长阿伦斯在访问华盛顿期间声称，尽管几个月来中东地区发生了变化，沙米尔政府不会从原有的立场退让。看来，如果美国想要在中东问题上有所作为，还得促使以色列改变态度。
