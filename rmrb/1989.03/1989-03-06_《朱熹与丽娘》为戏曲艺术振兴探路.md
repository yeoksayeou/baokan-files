The five-episode Huangmei opera musical television series *Juxi and Liniang*, produced by Anhui Television, recently received unanimous praise from experts at a viewing and discussion meeting held in Beijing.

During the period when the Southern Song Dynasty scholar Juxi preached the doctrine of "suppressing human desires and preserving heavenly principles" to his disciples on Mount Wuyi, he became infatuated with Hu Liniang, whom he had held up as a model of "virtuous womanhood" and "chaste and virtuous behavior." Meanwhile, Hu Liniang, who was unwilling to be a sacrifice to feudal ethics, sought an opportunity to avenge herself on Juxi, gradually turning her hatred into love. However, this sincere love was ultimately destroyed by the "heavenly principles" that Juxi advocated and upheld. Through this tragicomedy, the creators criticized the feudal ethics that stifle human nature.

The combination of national characteristics and modern consciousness is a distinctive feature of the drama. The creators skillfully integrated the expressive art of opera with the realistic art of television drama, emphasizing a brisk pace. They used Mandarin dialogue to overcome the limitations of regional dialects and accompanied the Huangmei opera music with modern electronic instruments, enhancing the musical aesthetic. These elements cater to the aesthetic tastes of audiences at different levels, exploring new paths for the revival of opera art, which is currently in a slump.

　　《朱熹与丽娘》为戏曲艺术振兴探路
    安徽电视台拍摄的五集黄梅戏音乐电视连续剧《朱熹与丽娘》，日前在北京举行的观摩座谈会上受到专家一致好评。
    南宋理学家朱熹在武夷山向其弟子宣扬“灭人欲，存天理”之说期间，迷恋起被自己树为“妇德楷模”、“贞烈可风”的节妇胡丽娘来；而不甘当封建礼教殉葬品，寻隙找朱熹复仇的胡丽娘也逐渐将恨化为爱。但这真挚的爱情却被朱熹倡导和维护的天理葬送了。编导通过这一悲喜剧批判了绞杀人性的封建伦理。
    民族特色和现代意识共存是该剧艺术上的特色。编导将写意的戏曲艺术与写实的电视剧艺术较协调地融为一体，强调明快的节奏；用普通话对白，克服方言的局限；以黄梅戏音乐为素材，用现代电声乐器伴奏，增加了音乐的美感。这些都适合不同层次观众的审美情趣，为振兴目前处于低谷的戏曲艺术探索了新路子。（江边）
