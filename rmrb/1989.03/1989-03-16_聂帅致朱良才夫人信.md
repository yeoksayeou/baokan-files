Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 16th.

Dear Comrade Li Kaifen:

On February 22, Comrade Zhu Liangcai bid us farewell forever. This unfortunate news has left me deeply disturbed. When he was critically ill, I had Zhuang Ruihua (my wife) visit him at the hospital. For over a decade, he endured immense suffering from his illness!

Comrade Zhu Liangcai joined the Hunan Uprising as early as 1928 and was enlisted in the Red Army. However, it was not until April 1932, during the battle for Zhangzhou, that we first met. At that time, he was the Political Commissar of the 9th Division of the 3rd Red Army. Later, he participated in all the campaigns against the "encirclement and suppression," fighting bravely and achieving remarkable results. During the War of Resistance against Japan, around 1938, he was transferred to the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, serving as the Political Commissar of the 3rd Military Sub-Region, and later as the Deputy Director and Director of the Political Department of the Military Region. During the War of Liberation, to train a large number of cadres, the Military Region established the Military and Political Cadres School, with Comrade Zhu serving as the Deputy Principal and Deputy Political Commissar. After the founding of the nation, he served as the Director of the Political Department of the North China Military Region and the Political Commissar of the Beijing Military Region. It can be said that from the beginning of the War of Resistance, he fought side by side with me, becoming a good comrade-in-arms and a reliable assistant. Comrade Zhu dedicated his life to political work and was an outstanding political leader. With his thoughts, talents, and exemplary actions, he carried out political work deeply and effectively, reaching the hearts of every soldier. Everyone knows that in times of war, especially in the harsh environment of guerrilla warfare, without the soldiers' high consciousness and indomitable will, it would be impossible to defeat the enemy. Comrade Zhu paid great attention to building the grassroots level of the army and the construction of party branches, which played a significant role in consolidating and enhancing the army's combat effectiveness. Even after the founding of the nation, during the modernization and regularization of our army, Comrade Zhu never forgot to strengthen grassroots political work, contributing to the promotion of our army's political work traditions and the strengthening of political work construction.

Now, Comrade Zhu has left us. The Party has lost a loyal old soldier and old Party member, and we have lost a close old comrade-in-arms. You and your children have lost a beloved and respected family member! We are all very saddened. We can only turn our grief into strength, lift our spirits, and continue to strive for the great cause of revitalizing China. Please take care of yourself and be strong!

Sincerely,

Nie Rongzhen

　　聂帅致朱良才夫人信李开芬同志：
    ２月２２日，良才同志和我们永别了，这不幸的消息使我久久不能平静。他病危时，我让瑞华（张瑞华，聂帅夫人——编者）特去医院看望了他。十几年来，卧居愁房，他受尽了病痛之苦！
    良才同志早在１９２８年参加湘南暴动，编入红军，但到１９３２年４月打漳州时，我们才相识。那时他是红三军九师的政委。以后他参加历次反“围剿”，作战勇敢，战绩显著。抗战时期，大约１９３８年，他调来晋察冀军区，任第三军分区政委，以后又任军区政治部副主任、主任等职。解放战争时期，为大量培养干部，军区组建军政干部学校，良才同志兼任副校长、副政委。建国后，任华北军区政治部主任、北京军区政委。可以说从抗战开始就和我并肩战斗，成为我的一位好战友、好帮手。良才同志毕生从事政治工作，是一位优秀的政治工作领导者。以他的思想、才能和模范行动，把政治工作做深做活，做到每个战士心坎里。大家知道，战争的年代，尤其是在游击战的艰苦环境中，没有战士们的崇高觉悟和坚忍毅力，要想战胜敌人是不可能的。良才同志非常重视抓部队的基层建设，抓党支部的建设，这对巩固和提高部队的战斗力，起着重大的作用。直到建国后，在我军展开现代化、正规化的建设中，良才同志仍念念不忘加强基层政治工作，为发扬我军政治工作优良传统，加强政治工作建设，作出贡献。
    现在，良才同志离开了我们，党失去了一位忠诚的老战士、老党员，我们失去了一位亲密的老战友，而你和孩子们失去了一位可亲可敬的亲人！我们都很难过。我们只有化悲痛为力量，振奋精神，继续为振兴中华的伟大事业努力奋斗。望你节哀，多保重！
