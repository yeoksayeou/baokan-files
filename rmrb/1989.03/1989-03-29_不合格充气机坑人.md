Last December 12, I purchased an automatic bicycle air compressor worth 9,520 yuan from Zhejiang Shaoxing Gas Equipment Machinery Factory. Upon returning to Wuhan, I soon discovered that this air compressor not only lacked a quality inspection certificate but also could not be installed or used. On December 19, I requested the factory to send someone to guide the installation, but no one came. On the 28th of the same month, I went to the factory to request a refund. Faced with the facts, the factory also admitted that this type of air compressor had issues, but they refused to refund, proposing instead to help me sell the product locally. Isn't this still harming consumers?

　　不合格充气机坑人
    去年１２月１２日，我从浙江绍兴气具机械厂购得价值９５２０元的自行车自动充气机，回到武汉后不久，发现这台充气机不但没有质量检验合格证，而且无法安装使用。１２月１９日，我要求厂方派人指导安装，没有人来。当月２８日，我去厂里请求退货。在事实面前，厂方也承认这种充气机有问题，但不同意退货，提出帮我把货就地推销。这不是仍在坑害消费者吗？
