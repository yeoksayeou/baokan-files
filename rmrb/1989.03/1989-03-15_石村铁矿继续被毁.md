The Stone Village Iron Mine Continues to Be Destroyed

Last September 24, the fifth edition of your newspaper published my letter to the editor, "Local Government Measures Are Ineffective, Stone Village Iron Mine Is Severely Damaged," which exposed that the Stone Village Iron Mine of Lin County Steel Plant has been illegally mined by nearby farmers for five years, causing severe damage to the country's mineral resources. However, the Lin County government has not taken active measures to stop the illegal behavior of some farmers, and has even failed to implement the decisions made by the relevant departments of the city. Now, the illegal mining of the Stone Village Iron Mine has further expanded, and there are already eight illegal mining points on the mine.

Since late November last year, some farmers have entered the No. 2 ore body of the iron mine through two illegal mining points, re-mined the safety pillars, and stolen and damaged the mine's equipment. Some farmers have blasted on the ore body above, threatening the safety of more than 200 iron mine workers who were working. The illegal mining point on the No. 5 ore body has connected with the Stone Village Iron Mine tunnel, resulting in the destruction of the No. 5 ore body. On December 1, when the safety inspection team organized by Lin Steel arrived at the scene to stop the illegal miners, some people even pushed the rocks they had previously piled up, injuring two people on the spot.

The Stone Village Iron Mine is the main ore production base of the Lin County Steel Plant, approved by the state. However, due to years of illegal mining, it has been severely damaged, normal production and construction cannot be carried out, and the safety of workers' lives cannot be guaranteed. If this continues, the mine built with the state's investment of several million yuan will be destroyed.

### 石村铁矿继续被毁

　　石村铁矿继续被毁
    去年９月２４日，你报第五版刊登我写的《当地政府措施不力，石村铁矿遍体鳞伤》的读者来信，披露林县钢铁厂石村铁矿遭到附近农民哄采达５年之久，国家矿产资源遭到严重破坏的情况后，林县政府没有采取积极的措施制止一些农民的违法行为，甚至对市有关部门作出的处理决定也不贯彻落实。现在，哄采石村铁矿资源的势态进一步扩大，矿山上的哄采点已达８处。
    去年１１月下旬以来，有的农民顺着铁矿２号矿体上的两处哄采点，直接进入矿体，再次回采安全柱，并大肆偷盗、破坏矿山设备。一些农民在矿体上方放炮采矿，使２００多名正在作业的铁矿职工的生命安全受到威胁。５号矿体上哄采点的巷道已与石村铁矿巷道串通，致使５号矿体被毁。１２月１日，林钢组织的安全检查人员赶到现场制止哄采者的不法行为时，有些人竟把事先堆放的岩石推下来，当场砸伤两人。
    石村铁矿是经国家批准的林县钢铁厂的主要矿石生产基地，但因连年的哄采而遭到极为严重的破坏，正常的生产建设不能进行，职工生命安全无法保障。这样下去，国家投资几千万元建设起来的矿山就要被毁掉了。
