The Afghan seven-party alliance's guerrilla forces, numbering in the thousands, launched an offensive from the south and southeast of Jalalabad on March 6, capturing several positions. The Jalalabad airport was one of the main targets of the attack, and the fighting there was particularly intense. Tass reported this evening that under artillery and aerial bombardment, the Kabul government's forces repelled the guerrilla offensive by the evening of the 7th. Both sides continued to fight fiercely at the airport today. The guerrillas also attacked the Kabul-Jalalabad highway, attempting to cut off the supply lines. However, a large number of weapons, ammunition, and troops were transported from Kabul to Jalalabad.

Since the Afghan guerrillas launched their attack on Jalalabad on March 6, the battlefield situation has been severe and complex. This is the first large-scale confrontation between the Kabul government forces and the guerrillas since the last Soviet soldier withdrew from Afghanistan on February 15, and it is significant for both sides.

Jalalabad is the capital of Nangarhar Province, with a population of 350,000, located 150 kilometers from Kabul and 70 kilometers from the Pakistani border. The Afghan seven-party alliance established a provisional government in Pakistan on February 23 and decided to first capture Jalalabad to make it the provisional government's base.

The Soviet newspaper Izvestia reported this evening that in the suburbs of Jalalabad, both sides are engaged in close combat, but the guerrillas have not been able to break through the city's defensive perimeter.

　　贾拉拉巴德激战
    新华社记者  王宪举
    阿富汗七党联盟游击队集结数千人，于３月６日从贾拉拉巴德以南和东南方向发动攻势，占据了不少阵地。贾拉拉巴德飞机场是主要攻击目标之一，战斗特别激烈。苏联塔斯社今晚报道说，在大炮和飞机轰炸下，喀布尔政府军于７日晚上遏制了游击队的攻势。双方在机场今天继续激战。游击队还向喀布尔—贾拉拉巴德公路进行袭击，企图切断运输线。但是大量武器、弹药和兵力从喀布尔运到了贾拉拉巴德。
    自从３月６日阿富汗游击队向贾拉拉巴德城发动进攻以来，战场形势严峻而复杂。这是２月１５日最后一名苏联士兵撤离阿富汗后，喀布尔政府军和游击队之间第一次大规模的较量，对于双方都具有重要意义。
    贾拉拉巴德是楠格哈尔省省会，人口３５万，距喀布尔１５０公里，离巴基斯坦边境７０公里。阿富汗七党联盟２月２３日在巴基斯坦成立了临时政府，并决定首先攻克贾拉拉巴德，使它成为临时政府所在地。
    苏联《消息报》今晚刊登路透社的报道说，在贾拉拉巴德市郊双方在短兵相接，但是游击队未能突破该城的防御圈。
