Increasing agricultural loans is one of the key measures to boost agricultural investment this year. However, recent information indicates that from January to February, the net loans issued by the Agricultural Bank of China and rural credit cooperatives amounted to 3.3 billion yuan, which is less than half of the net agricultural loans issued in the same period last year.

According to the relevant departments of the Agricultural Bank, several factors contributed to this situation. Apart from normal factors such as adjusting the credit structure, reducing household commercial and consumer loans, using some household production cost deposits, and delayed seasons in some regions, the primary issue is the shortage of credit funds for spring agricultural production in rural financial institutions. In the first two months of this year, the sales progress of grain, cotton, and other agricultural products was slow in some regions, tying up a large amount of funds. The Agricultural Bank recovered 4.2 billion yuan less in agricultural product procurement funds compared to the same period last year. Some agricultural products have been sold, but the funds have not been recovered due to delays by the other party. Additionally, the disbursement of some special agricultural loan funds was delayed. Furthermore, rural credit cooperatives saw a 1.6 billion yuan decrease in savings compared to the same period last year. All these factors directly led to a reduction in the sources of agricultural loan funds.

The relevant departments of the Agricultural Bank predict that after the rural financial institutions organize funds from various channels and the People's Bank of China arranges a temporary loan of 2 billion yuan, agricultural loans in March and April will see a significant increase. However, to reach last year's level, the funding gap remains substantial. Therefore, it is crucial to appeal to all relevant parties to pay high attention to this issue, take a comprehensive approach, and do a good job in the planned sales of grain and cotton. Strengthen the management of fund settlements, and work together to increase the sources of agricultural loan funds. Ensure that spring agricultural production funds are implemented in a timely manner, and do not miss the opportunity to achieve a bumper agricultural harvest.

　　农业信贷缺口大
    头两月净投放额比去年同期减半       
    农行呼吁快筹资快投放莫误农时
    本报北京３月１５日讯  记者江夏报道：增加农业贷款是今年国家增加农业投入的重要措施之一，但记者刚刚了解的情况表明，１月至２月，中国农业银行和信用社农业贷款净投放为３３亿，不足去年同期农贷净投放的半数。
    据农行有关部门分析，这种情况的出现，除调整信贷结构、压缩了农户的工商和消费性贷款、部分地区优先使用了农户生产费用存款，加之一些地区季节推迟等正常因素外，主要是由于农村金融部门春耕生产信贷资金不足。今年前两个月，部分地区粮、棉等农副产品调销进度缓慢，占压了大量资金，农行比去年同期少收回农副产品收购资金４２亿元；有些农副产品货已调出，但款因对方拖欠收不回来；部分专项农业贷款资金下拨较迟。此外，信用社今年前两个月储蓄比去年同期少增加１６亿元，这些都直接造成了农贷资金来源的减少。
    农行有关部门预计，在农村金融部门多方组织资金和近日中央银行安排２０亿元临时贷款以后，３、４月份农贷将有较大增加，但是要达到去年的水平，资金缺口仍然很大，因此，要呼吁各有关方面高度重视这一问题，从全局出发，按国家计划做好粮、棉调销工作，加强资金结算的管理，共同配合，努力增加农业信贷投入的资金来源，不误农时地落实春耕生产资金，万万不可贻误夺取农业丰收的大局。
