Wuxi Bans the Bundling of Obsolete Goods

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanjing on March 14, relevant departments in Wuxi City recently decided that all production, wholesale, and retail enterprises must not bundle or indirectly bundle substandard, obsolete goods. Advertising agencies are strictly prohibited from running advertisements for bundled goods, otherwise, they will be heavily fined.

	Wuxi City's relevant departments remind the general public to strengthen self-protection awareness, resist the bundling of goods, and report immediately upon discovery. For those who blindly accept bundled goods and purchase substandard goods, relevant departments will no longer handle their complaints.
