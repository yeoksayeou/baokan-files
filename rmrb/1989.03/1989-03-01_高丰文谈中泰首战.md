After the match between China and Thailand concluded, China's head coach Gao Fengwen shared his thoughts on the game.

Gao Fengwen expressed satisfaction with the 3-0 result, viewing it as a step forward towards the set goal. However, he felt that the players' performance was not up to par and that they should have played better. For instance, in the first half of the game, the Chinese team had the upper hand for the first 25 minutes, but they couldn't break the deadlock, which was evident to everyone. In the following 20 minutes, Thailand increased their offensive efforts, turning the match into a tug-of-war, but they didn't create many threatening opportunities.

Gao Fengwen also pointed out that the 0-0 score at halftime was not commensurate with the Chinese team's offensive prowess. It was not a normal occurrence that the Chinese team couldn't score.

Gao Fengwen added that in the second half, the Chinese team opened up the game, and timely adjustments to the lineup, bringing in two fresh players, had a significant impact. The Chinese team's offensive in front of Thailand's goal became much more aggressive. However, the coordination among the players was inconsistent. Scoring three goals, regardless of the circumstances, was still satisfying. The players' morale is high, and everything is normal. They will depart from Bangkok for Bangladesh on the evening of March 1 to play an away match, aiming to secure a victory against the Bangladesh team.

　　高丰文谈中泰首战
    中泰之战结束之后，中国队主教练高丰文谈了对这场球的看法。
    高丰文对３∶０的战果尚表满意，认为这是向既定的目标迈进了一步。但队员的表现不能说很好，他们应该发挥得更好一些。比如在上半场的前２５分钟，中国队占尽优势，但就是打不开局面，这是大家都有目共睹的。后２０分钟泰国队加紧了进攻，和中国队打成拉锯战，但他们有威胁的球也不算多。
    高丰文还指出，上半场０∶０的结局与中国队攻势之盛是不相称的，中国队未能破门不是正常的现象。
    高丰文还说，下半场中国队打开了局面，与及时改变阵容，调上两个生力军有一定关系。中国队在泰国队门前的攻势凶猛了很多。但队员之间的配合时好时坏。能进三个球，不管怎么说总是令人满意的。队员们现在情绪很高，一切情况正常，３月１日晚上将离开曼谷飞赴孟加拉国打客场的比赛，争取对孟队的胜利。
