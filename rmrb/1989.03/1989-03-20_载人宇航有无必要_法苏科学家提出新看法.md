Recently, after the completion of manned spaceflight missions by the Soviet Union and the United States, space experts from France and the Soviet Union have offered differing views on the matter.

The director of the Space Research Committee of the French Academy of Sciences, Robert Castan, believes the following:

1. Sending humans into space is a display of wealth and showmanship, rather than a necessity.
2. For most space research experiments and scientific observations, automated satellites and robots are more effective and cost less.
3. Spending a large amount of manpower and resources to send people into space will inevitably affect other research fields, such as robotics.
4. The significance of sending humans into space for biological experiments is like a drop in the ocean, as the time astronauts spend in weightlessness is too short. If this money were spent on Earth, for example, on treating AIDS and cancer, the effects would be much greater.
5. In the long term, for the development of certain special research fields and projects, such as establishing a base on the moon, humans in space will be necessary. However, in the short term, astronauts may become obstacles to scientific research. His conclusion is: "Sending living humans into space is of no use."

According to French newspapers, Gorbachev's advisor, Roald Sagdeyev, also expressed similar views. This academician, who had served as the director of the Soviet Institute of Space Research for fifteen years, said that space shuttles are outstanding technological achievements, but they are of no use. "Flying back and forth has no scientific significance. Sending any payload into orbit with any conventional rocket is simpler and cheaper than with a space shuttle." He also pointed out that the Soviet Union's achievements in spaceflight are "mostly imitations of others' old tricks."

### 载人宇航有无必要  法苏科学家提出新看法

　　载人宇航有无必要
    法苏科学家提出新看法
    苏美两国最近完成载人宇航之后，法国和苏联的太空专家对此提出了一些不同的看法。
    法国科学院太空研究委员会主任罗伯特·卡斯坦认为：一、把人送入宇宙是摆阔和炫耀，而不是必须。二、就大部分太空研究试验和科学观测来说，自动化卫星和机器人更为有效，而且花钱少。三、花费大量人力物力送人上天势必影响其它科研领域，例如机器人领域的工作。四、把人送入宇宙进行生物学试验的意义犹如大海中的一滴水，因为宇航员在失重条件下所度过的时间毕竟太短。如果把这笔钱花在地球上，用于医治艾滋病和癌症，其效果则大得多。五、从长远看，为开拓某些特殊的科研领域和项目，如在月球建立基地，到那时宇宙人是有必要的。但从近期看，宇宙飞人可能成为科研的障碍。他的结论是：“往太空送活人没有任何用处。”
    据法国报纸报道，戈尔巴乔夫的顾问罗阿尔德·萨格杰耶夫也表示了类似的看法。这位曾担任过十五年苏联宇宙考察研究所所长的院士说，宇宙飞船是技术的杰出成就，但没有用处。“飞来飞去没有任何科学意义，用任何一种常规火箭把一个负荷送入轨道都比宇宙飞船简单、省钱”。他还指出，苏联在宇航方面“很多东西不过是模仿别人的老套子”。
