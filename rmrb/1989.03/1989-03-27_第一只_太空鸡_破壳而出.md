The first "space chicken" hatched yesterday evening at the headquarters of the Kentucky Fried Chicken company in Kentucky. The egg, which had traveled in space aboard the U.S. "Discovery" space shuttle for five days, hatched into a 41.8-gram male chick.

At 8:29 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, the first "space chicken" in history emerged from its shell.

This experiment was initiated by the Kentucky Fried Chicken company and designed by Purdue University student John Vellinger. The purpose was to determine the effects of weightlessness on embryonic development.

A spokesperson for the Kentucky Fried Chicken company said that the "space chicken" appears to be normal, but further observations are needed to confirm this.

The "Discovery" space shuttle was launched on March 13, carrying a total of 32 eggs. Scholars from four universities will study the chicks that hatch from these eggs.

　　第一只“太空鸡”破壳而出
    新华社华盛顿３月２５日电  曾经搭乘美国“发现”号航天飞机作５天太空旅行的一枚鸡蛋昨晚在肯塔基家乡鸡公司的总部孵出了一只４１．８克重的雄性鸡雏。
    美国东部时间下午８点２９分，有史以来第一只“太空鸡”破壳而出。
    这是由经营炸鸡的肯塔基家乡鸡公司发起、由珀杜大学学生约翰·维林格设计的一项实验，旨在测定失重状态对胚胎发育的影响。
    家乡鸡公司的发言人说，“太空鸡”看来一切如常，但具体情况还有待今后观察。
    “发现”号航天飞机本月１３日发射升空，共带有３２枚鸡蛋。来自４所大学的学者将对由这些鸡蛋孵出的小鸡进行研究。
