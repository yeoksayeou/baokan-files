To protect the ecological environment and natural scenery

A dam project in Colorado is blocked

People's Daily, Washington, March 24th - Reporter Cang Lide reports: The Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, William Reilly, decided today to block the Colorado State environmental protection officials from approving the construction of a dam in the Colorado Canyon.

The project was proposed by Denver 8 years ago, with a planned investment of $1 billion to build a high dam in the two-forks region upstream of the South Platte River flowing through the city. The aim is to solve the increasing water demand in the suburbs of Denver. This project had the approval of the Reagan administration. According to the usual practice, once approved by local environmental protection officials, construction can begin.

However, the dam project has sparked a heated debate. Some environmental and resource protection advocates who oppose the dam believe that the construction of the Two Forks Dam will submerge the scenic Chasm Canyon area, destroying the living conditions of local wild animals such as salmon and cranes, as well as the natural ecological environment. Reilly stated that the project's reasons for avoiding environmental damage are insufficient; although Denver is short of water, he also needs to respect the interests of other Coloradans and all Americans.

The Colorado environmental protection officials believe that Reilly's action, which breaks with tradition, indicates that the environmental protection policy of the Bush administration has shifted in focus compared to the Reagan era.

    美科州一水坝计划受阻
    本报华盛顿３月２４日电  记者仓立德报道：美国环境保护局局长威廉·雷利今天决定，阻止科罗拉多州环境保护官员批准在科罗拉多峡谷兴建水坝的计划。
    这项计划是丹佛市８年前提出的，准备投资１０亿美元，在流经该市的南普拉特河上游两岔口地区建造一道高坝，以解决丹佛市郊区日益增加的用水需求问题。这项计划曾得到里根政府的赞同，按照惯例，一经当地环保官员批准即可开工。
    但是，建坝计划也引起一场激烈辩论。一些反对建坝的环境、资源保护人士认为，两岔口大坝建成后将淹没风景秀丽的奇斯曼峡谷地区、破坏当地鲑鱼、仙鹤等野生动物的生存条件和自然生态环境。雷利表示，这项工程能够避免环境破坏的理由不充足；尽管丹佛缺水，但他也要尊重其他科罗拉多人及全体美国人的利益。
    科罗拉多环保负责人认为，雷利采取这项打破惯例的行动表明。布什政府的环保政策与里根时代相比在重点上有了转变。
