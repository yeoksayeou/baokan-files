Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 27th. Reporter Lin Jiaoming reports: The first cabinet meeting of the new Sudanese government unanimously accepted the peace agreement reached last November between the Democratic Unionist Party and the "Sudan People's Liberation Army" in the south, marking a breakthrough in resolving the five-year-long civil war.

The Sudanese Minister of Information announced yesterday that the cabinet has established a special committee to liaise with the southern anti-government forces, the "Sudan People's Liberation Army," to discuss the implementation of various clauses in the peace agreement.

The peace agreement signed by the Democratic Unionist Party led by Mirghani and the "Sudan People's Liberation Army" led by Garang was vetoed by the previous parliament, leading to a political crisis in Sudan and a change in government.

The peace agreement stipulates a comprehensive ceasefire in the south, the end of the state of emergency that has been in effect since 1985, the suspension of the implementation of Islamic Sharia law, the replacement of criminal law, and the convening of a constitutional conference, among other provisions.

　　苏丹内阁接受和平协议        
    五年内战出现和解曙光
    本报开罗三月二十七日电  记者林皎明报道：苏丹新政府第一次内阁会议一致接受民主联合党去年十一月与南部“苏丹人民解放军”达成的和平协议，使长达五年的内战局面出现和解的突破。
    苏丹新闻部长昨天宣布，内阁已成立专门委员会，负责与南部反政府力量“苏丹人民解放军”联系，协商执行和平协议的诸项条款。
    以米尔加尼为首的苏丹民主联合党与戈朗为首的“苏丹人民解放军”签署的南部和平协议遭到上届议会否决，导致苏丹政局危机。苏丹政府为此更迭。
    和平协议规定，在南部实行全面停火，结束自一九八五年以来实行的紧急状态，中止实施伊斯兰教规，替代刑法及召开宪政大会等。
