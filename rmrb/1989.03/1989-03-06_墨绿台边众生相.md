The crowd by the green felt table

A woman's tears are not easily shed

Wang Lan Ying, the runner-up in last year's Hai Yan Cup National Women's Billiards Tournament, "fell" in the public billiards tournament, being eliminated in the first round by an unknown young player. She stepped down from the table and couldn't help but burst into tears. "I'm so unlucky," Wang Lan Ying said. "If I had lost to someone stronger than me, I wouldn't have anything to say." Wang Lan Ying has paid a considerable price for this game of billiards. Her home is in Harbin. In her spare time, she became addicted to billiards. Just as she was getting into it, Harbin "closed the tables." She quit her job, left her four-year-old daughter, and went to Beijing to work as a caddy at the Sun City Billiards Room, a job that provided her with unparalleled conditions for practicing. She said, "I lost this time, but I don't want to put down my cue. I have to make something of it."

The "streetwise" player

Sun Junhua stands by the international standard billiards table to compete, but he can't show the same ease as when he plays on the street tables. Facing so many experts, he feels a bit tense and always feels like his hands aren't listening to him. "Competition is different from just playing around," he said. Two years ago, Sun Junhua started playing on the street tables. He is clever and skilled with his hands. When he couldn't find opponents at his doorstep, he went to the billiards room to find high-hand players, playing at least two hours every day. Sun Junhua often plays billiards, naturally inviting criticism from his parents, but he says, "This is my only joy."

They come from the barracks

Among the 11 military personnel participating in this competition, 7 are from the Beijing Logistics Department Independent Motorized Second Battalion, and the battalion's political instructor, dressed in military uniform, stands out. Last year, when they participated in the Beijing Club Cup Billiards Tournament, many people did not take them seriously, thinking they were just joining in the fun and couldn't play well. However, they won two team runner-up titles, surprising everyone. Zhang Qiufeng, who has already entered the top 20 in snooker, told the reporter that their battalion takes the development of billiards as an important part of enriching the troops' cultural life, and often invites Beijing billiards experts to the troops to teach. The soldiers say, billiards can liven up life, exercise the body, and win glory for the troops, why not?

　　墨绿台边众生相
    巾帼有泪不轻弹
    去年海燕杯全国女子台球赛亚军王兰英在台球公开赛中“栽”了，第一轮就被一个名不见经传的小将淘汰。她走下场禁不住泪流满面。“倒霉死了，要是让比我强的人赢了，我没什么说的。”王兰英为这台球，付出了相当大的代价。她家在哈尔滨，业余时间迷上了台球。正打得上瘾时，哈尔滨“封台”了。她辞了工作，丢下刚满４岁的女儿，一人跑到北京在太阳城台球房做陪打员，这个职业给她提供了得天独厚的练球条件。她说：“我这次输了，但并不想放下台球杆，非搞出点名堂不可。”
    “野路子”选手
    孙军华站在国际标准的台球架子边比赛，可拿不出他在马路边上打球时的潇洒劲，面对众多高手，他有些紧张，总觉得手不听使唤。“比赛到底和瞎玩不同”，他说。两年前，孙军华摸杆，开始在野台子上打。他脑子灵手巧，在家门口找不到对手，他就到台球房找高手，每天至少玩两个小时。孙军华经常打台球，自然遭到父母指责，但是他说：“这是我唯一的乐趣。”
    他们来自军营
    参加这次比赛的１１名军人中有７位来自北京后勤部队独立汽车第二营，而且这个营的教导员，穿着军装上阵，引人注目。去年他们参加北京俱乐部杯台球赛时，很多人不以为然，认为是凑热闹，不可能打好。可是他们却取得两项团体亚军，令人刮目相看。已进入司诺克前２０名的张秋丰告诉记者，他们营把开展台球运动作为丰富部队业余文化生活的重要内容，还经常请北京市台球专家来部队传艺。战士们说，台球既能活跃生活，锻炼身体，又能为部队争先，何乐而不为？
