On January 29, 1989, the list of winners for the 46th Golden Globe Awards was announced, and "Rain Man" won the awards for Best Picture and Best Actor.

On February 15, 1989, the nominations for the 61st Academy Awards were announced, and "Rain Man" received 8 nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Cinematography, leading the nominations.

On February 21, 1989, the 39th Berlin International Film Festival closed, and "Rain Man" won the highest honor—the Golden Bear Award.

In less than a month, "Rain Man" consecutively won multiple awards and nominations, attracting global attention and becoming the darling of the film critics.

The plot of "Rain Man" is quite simple. Raymond (played by Dustin Hoffman) is an autistic patient, and "Rain Man" is his nickname from childhood. His father, a millionaire, left his entire $3 million inheritance to the rehabilitation center that had cared for Raymond for 20 years. Raymond's younger brother Charlie (played by Tom Cruise), who is cunning and greedy, is a car salesman in Los Angeles. Upon hearing the news, he decided to kidnap his brother and take him on a tour of the United States. If the rehabilitation center wanted Raymond back, they would have to pay a ransom. During the journey, Charlie, out of brotherly affection, took good care of his brother, but Raymond showed no response. In the end, Charlie had no choice but to send his brother back to the rehabilitation center.

A film with such a simple plot winning such acclaim is not a coincidence. First, the film's subject matter is novel and rare among the countless Hollywood films. "Autism" is a rare condition, affecting about 4-5 people out of every 100,000, with the vast majority being male. Surprisingly, out of every 10 patients, one shows some form of genius. Raymond is an autistic genius; he not only has a photographic memory but also the computational ability of a computer, except in emotional matters, where he cannot communicate with others. The film uses this rare subject to explore the universal concern of disability issues, touching the hearts of millions and sparking strong social reactions. Thomas Nanni, the director of the American Autism Association, said, "People will see a living person in this film, not just an autistic patient. Literary descriptions cannot achieve this."

Second, the film's narrative structure uses the "road movie" format, which is conducive to the interpretation of the theme of brotherly love. During the journey, the utilitarian younger brother and the autistic older brother spend day and night together, and their feelings deepen (although the older brother shows no response). This process is quite moving. For audiences who are used to the overly entertaining and commercially heavy American films, this is quite refreshing, and for the Berlin International Film Festival, which values film artistry, awarding the grand prize to this film is quite natural.

Finally, the film has put a lot of effort into character development, and the actors have a solid foundation and natural performances, adding a lot to the film. Dustin Hoffman, who plays Raymond, is a famous character actor in the United States. From "Kramer vs. Kramer," "The Graduate," "Midnight Cowboy" to "Rain Man," he has played different roles, but they are all small characters. He has been in the industry for 20 years and is known for his ability to portray the inner lives of small characters. Originally, he was supposed to play Charlie, but at his insistence, he changed to play Raymond. To play this role well, Hoffman befriended two brothers in real life—one with autism and the other ordinary. He and Tom Cruise, who plays Charlie, lived with these two brothers, imitating their every move. The brothers' language later entered the script and became part of the film. Hard work pays off. The autistic genius character that Hoffman created on screen is authentic and radiates artistic brilliance.

The director of this film, Barry Levinson, is a famous director in Hollywood and has directed "Good Morning, Vietnam."

"Rain Man," a film that took 4 years and went through many hardships to complete, will it win the Oscar this year? We eagerly await the results.

　　《雨中人》——        影评界的宠儿
    １９８９年１月２９日，第４６届金球奖获奖名单公布，《雨中人》荣获最佳影片和最佳男演员两项大奖。
    １９８９年２月１５日，第６１届奥斯卡奖提名公布，《雨中人》获８项提名，包括最佳影片、最佳导演、最佳原剧本、最佳男演员、最佳摄影等，位居提名之首。
    １９８９年２月２１日，第３９届西柏林国际电影节闭幕，《雨中人》赢得最高荣誉——金熊奖。
    在不到一个月的时间里，《雨中人》连续荣获多项大奖和提名，举世瞩目，成了影评界的宠儿。
    《雨中人》的故事情节很简单。雷蒙德（达斯廷·霍夫曼扮演）是个自闭症患者，“雨中人”是他童年时代的绰号。父亲是百万富翁，死后将３００万美元遗产全部赠给收容雷蒙德达２０年之久的疗养院，雷蒙德弟弟查利（汤姆·克鲁斯扮演）刁滑贪财，是洛杉矶的进口汽车推销员，闻讯后，心有不甘，决心绑架哥哥，带他周游美国，如果疗养院想要雷蒙德回去，就必须付一笔赎金。在旅途中，查利出于手足之情，对哥哥十分关怀，但雷蒙德毫无反应。最后，查利无奈只好把哥哥送回疗养院。
    一部情节简单的影片，却赢得如此声誉，决非偶然。首先，影片题材新颖，在好莱坞数以万计的影片中尚属罕见。“自闭症”是一种少见的病症，每１０万人中约有四五名发病者，绝大多数为男性。令人惊讶的是，每１０名发病者中必有一人显示出某种天才。雷蒙德就是一个自闭症天才，他不仅过目不忘，还有电脑的运算能力，唯独在感情方面，无法与人交流。影片用罕见的题材探讨了人类普遍关心的残疾人问题，拨动了千万人的心弦，引起社会强烈的反响。美国自闭症协会主任托马斯·纳尼说：“人们会从这部影片中看到一个活生生的人，而不仅仅只是一个自闭症患者，文学的描写无法做到这一点。”
    其次，影片叙事采用了“公路片”的结构，有利于手足之情这一主题的阐释。在旅途中，急功近利的弟弟与患自闭症的哥哥朝夕相处，感情日增（尽管哥哥毫无反应），其过程表现得相当动人。这对看惯了过份强调娱乐性、商业气息浓重的美国片的观众来说，大有耳目一新之感，而对一向重视电影艺术性的西柏林国际电影节来说，将大奖授予该片也就理所当然了。
    再次，影片在角色塑造上下了很大功夫，演员功底深厚，表演自然，给影片增色不少。扮演雷蒙德的霍夫曼是美国著名的性格演员。从《克莱默夫妇》、《毕业生》、《午夜牛郎》到《雨中人》，他扮演过不同角色，但都是小人物。他从影２０年，一向以擅长刻画小人物的内心活动而蜚声影坛。原定他扮演查利，但在他本人坚持下改演雷蒙德。为了演好这一角色，霍夫曼结识现实生活中的两兄弟——一为自闭症患者，一为普通人——他与扮演查利的克鲁斯跟这两兄弟生活在一起，模仿他们的一举一动。两兄弟的语言后来也进入剧本，变成影片的一部分。功夫不负有心人。霍夫曼在银幕上塑造的这个自闭症天才的形象真实可信，闪烁着艺术的光辉。
    本片导演巴里·莱文森是好莱坞著名导演，曾执导《早安，越南》一片。
    《雨中人》这部历时４年、几经磨难、终告完成的影片，能否夺得本届奥斯卡金像奖，我们翘首以待。
