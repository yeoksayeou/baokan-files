Electric fishing nets threaten fish populations

Taiyang Lake, Xiabanzhou, and Qianzi Lake in our county are part of the Poyang Lake area. Since last December, many people have been using electric nets to fish in the lake. By January 30th of this year, according to incomplete statistics from our county's lake management bureau, there are over 100 electric net boats entering the lake area daily in our county alone. Adding the electric net boats from counties such as Jinxian, Boyang, Yugan, Yongxiu, and Nanchang, the entire Poyang Lake area has over 2,000 electric net boats fishing in the lake daily. Additionally, there are hundreds of fixed electric nets within Poyang Lake. The aquatic resources in the lake area are facing the danger of being completely depleted. Recently, while patrolling the lake by boat, I saw countless fish fry floating on the water surface, electrocuted to death.

### 电网捕鱼断绝鱼子孙

　　电网捕鱼断绝鱼子孙
    我县太阳湖、下岸洲、千字湖等属鄱阳湖区，去年１２月以来，不少人使用电电网下湖捕鱼。到今年１月３０日，据我县湖管局不完全统计，仅我县每天进入湖区的电网船有１００多艘，加上进贤、波阳、余干、永修、南昌等县的电网船，整个鄱阳湖区日有２０００多艘电网船下湖捕鱼。另外，鄱阳湖内还有成百上千的定置电网，湖区水产资源正同临着“断子绝孙”的危险。最近，我乘船巡湖，见水面上飘浮着无数被电触死的鱼苗。
