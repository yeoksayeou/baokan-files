The workers' and peasants' inspection bodies in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) are an important force in the country's political life. They have 280,000 part-time inspectors distributed throughout the country and various enterprises. Their main responsibility is to exercise effective social supervision over the work of various units, serving as a practical form of socialist democracy. Recently, a reporter interviewed the Public Relations Department Director of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Committee, Comrade Alkewitz.

She explained that the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Committee was established in 1963 and has a history of 26 years. It is a supervisory body of the state and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, operating in parallel with party and state organs. Its main functions include: checking whether the decisions of the Party Central Committee are implemented in earnest; inspecting the consumption of energy, raw materials, and work hours, as well as the application of modern technology; overseeing the production of meat, vegetables, fruits, and other products, and assisting enterprise leaders in completing production plans; it also bears the responsibility of upholding the constitution and requires leaders at all levels to lead by example in observing the law.

Members of the grassroots workers' and peasants' inspection bodies come from various strata of society and parties, and are elected democratically, serving a term of 2 years. The public can report various issues to the workers' and peasants' inspection bodies at any time, which then conduct investigations and make recommendations to leaders at all levels, proposing solutions. For example, residents of Dresden reported that waiting times at hospitals were too long, requiring them to queue early for appointments, and specialist clinics were even more difficult to access. The Workers' and Peasants' Inspection Committee, together with the city's medical department, analyzed the inspection results and formulated four improvement measures: increasing equipment, simplifying procedures, pre-booking appointments, and signing cooperation agreements with medical colleges. The hospital services were significantly improved.

Because the workers' and peasants' inspection bodies can effectively function, the public is willing to report problems to them. The workers' and peasants' inspection bodies have become an indispensable part of the democratic system in the GDR.

　　民德的工农检查机构
    本报记者  许宏治
    民主德国的工农检查机构是国家政治生活中的一支重要力量。它现有２８万不脱产的工农检查员，分布在全国各地及各企业中，主要职责是对各单位的工作实行有力的社会监督，是发扬社会主义民主的一种有效形式。最近，记者采访了工农检查委员会的舆论部主任阿尔克维茨同志。
    她介绍说，工农检查委员会成立于１９６３年，已有２６年历史。它是国家和德国统一社会党的监督机构，与党和国家机关平行地发挥作用。它的主要作用是：检查党中央的决议是否如实得以贯彻；检查能源、原材料和工时的消耗情况以及现代技术的应用情况，检查肉类、蔬菜、水果等产品的生产，并监督、帮助各企业领导完成生产计划；它还负有维护宪法的责任，并要求各级领导带头守法。
    基层工农检查机构的成员来自社会各个阶层和各党派，是经民主选举产生的，每届任期２年。群众可随时向工农检查机构反映各种问题，它则负责调查，并向各级领导提出建议，订出解决措施。例如，德累斯顿市居民反映，去医院看病等候时间太长，很早就得去排队挂号，专科门诊更为困难。工农检查委员会与市医疗部门一同分析了检查结果，订出了增加设备、简化手续、预约挂号、医院与医学院签订合作协议等４条改进措施，医院服务显著改善。
    由于工农检查机构能有效地发挥作用，群众碰到问题都愿意向它反映。工农检查机构已成为民主德国民主制度不可缺少的一部分。
