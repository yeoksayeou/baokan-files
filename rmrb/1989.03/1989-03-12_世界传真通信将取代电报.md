Fax communication is set to replace telegraphs worldwide. In recent years, fax communication equipment has developed rapidly, growing at an average rate of 50-60% per year. To date, over 3.2 million fax machines have been put into use globally. By the early 1990s, the number of fax machines worldwide will surpass the number of telegraph terminals. As an indispensable tool for office automation, modern publishing, and economic activities, fax machines will soon replace telegraphs.

With the widespread use of microprocessors and large-scale integrated circuits, fax communication equipment has become a leading field in information technology due to its cost-effectiveness, ease of operation, fast recording speed, and ability to transmit various types of information. Currently, fax machines are widely used to transmit photographs, weather maps, design blueprints, signed checks and vouchers, meeting records, letters, documents, archives, and newspapers. The countries with the highest usage of fax machines include the United States, Britain, Japan, and Australia.

The United States currently has 800,000 fax machines in use. Among these, office fax machines are available at a ratio of 94 people per machine, document processors at 18 people per machine, and terminal devices at 3 people per machine, making it the country with the highest penetration rate in the world. In Britain, fax machine usage accounts for one-third of Europe's total. By August of the previous year, over 200,000 fax machines had been put into use. In Japan, the number of fax machines in use on the circuit network has exceeded 1.1 million, leading all other countries.

　　世界传真通信将取代电报
    近几年，世界传真通信设备发展迅速，平均每年以５０—６０％速度增长。到目前为止，全世界投入使用的传真机达３２０万台以上。９０年代初，全世界传真机的发展将超过用户电报终端数。作为当今办公室自动化、新闻出版现代化和进行经济活动不可缺少的得力工具，传真设备不久将会取代电报。
    随着微处理机和大规模集成电路的推广应用，传真通信设备以其经济性好、操作方便、记录速度快、能传送各种信息等特点而成为当今发展最快的信息领域。现在，传真机已广泛用来传送相片、气象云图、设计蓝图、支票签字和票据、会议记录、书信文件、资料档案和新闻报刊等各个方面。使用传真机最多的国家有美国、英国、日本和澳大利亚。
    美国目前使用的传真机有８０万台，其中办公用传真机达到９４人１台、文件处理机１８人１台、终端设备３人１台，是世界普及率最高的国家。英国的传真机使用占欧洲的１／３，到去年８月为止，有２０多万台传真机投入使用。日本现在电路网上使用的传真机已突破１１０万台，居各国之首。
