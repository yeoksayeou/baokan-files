A Unique Cultural Phenomenon
– A Casual Discussion on "Prison Songs" Part One
Jin Zhaojin

With the release of cassette tapes such as "Prison Songs," "Embrace Tomorrow," and "Tears of Regret," a considerable number of similar content cassette songs became popular, quickly forming a trend. Now, this wave of enthusiasm has gradually subsided, but this cultural phenomenon is still worth pondering.

For a long time, our country has had a unique musical subculture phenomenon, namely underground song creation. This form of creation constitutes the musical culture of a certain specific subcultural group. In the 1960s, a unique social group emerged in China—the "blind drifters." These people were mostly peasants who migrated from inland areas to the northwestern regions. Their lives were unstable and their composition was complex. Their unique way of life produced a specific cultural form and also a specific musical culture. The song "75 Days," which evolved from "Beautiful Havana," is a famous blind drifter song that has been sung for generations. During the Cultural Revolution, another highly distinctive subcultural group emerged—the "sent-down youth." Their unique non-worker, non-peasant, non-soldier, non-student, and non-merchant social status quickly manifested their unique cultural characteristics. They also had their own unique musical culture—"sent-down youth songs." Apart from some foreign folk songs and timely songs, creations such as "Night on the Yalu River," "Song of Nanjing," "From Beijing to Yan'an," "Song of Chongqing Sent-Down Youth," and "I Am a Capitalist's Daughter" became daily songs unique to the sent-down youth.

Additionally, it is important to note that China has long had a unique subcultural group, namely the re-education through labor and reform through labor personnel. Their living environment is obviously unique, and music is an important part of their lives. Similarly, apart from general songs, they also have their own created and adapted songs.

The main content of the "Prison Songs" cassette tapes is a mix of the aforementioned blind drifter songs, sent-down youth songs, and re-education through labor songs.

From this, it can be seen that although these songs are of different types and have varying interests, they share several common cultural characteristics. First, they have a strong subcultural nature. They generally contrast sharply with the mainstream culture and sometimes even appear in an anti-cultural form. Due to the significant differences in the way of life between the subcultural group and the general social group, their cultural forms often have a strong individuality. Sometimes, this individuality is expressed in an antagonistic manner.

Second, these songs often appear in a form that contrasts with the contemporary musical culture. They often use past musical materials combined with specific performance and singing methods, adopting a new form in the creation process. For example, "sent-down youth songs" often draw a strong lyrical style from pre-Cultural Revolution creations, even directly using a musical phrase as the leading motif.

"The Capitalist's Daughter" is adapted from "Distant Geese," and "From Beijing to Yan'an" is adapted from "Red Flag Canal Water Circles Taihang." These styles contrast with the musical styles of the Cultural Revolution. While the "Prison Songs" cassette songs contrast with the current popular music styles on the music scene. Although they also use the forms of popular music, their cultural consciousness does not show more innovation. Instead, it is a kind of regression.

    一种独特的文化现象
    ——“囚歌”漫议之一
    金兆钧
    随着《囚歌》、《拥抱明天》、《悔恨的泪》等盒式磁带的发行，相当一批类似内容的磁带歌曲风行一时，迅速形成一股浪潮。现在，这股热浪虽已渐渐过去，但这种文化现象却值得深思。
    很久以来，我国就存在一种特殊的音乐亚文化现象，即地下性的歌曲创作。这种创作形成为某一特定亚文化群的音乐文化。六十年代前后，我国产生了一个特殊的社会群体——盲流。这些人多为内地流浪至西北地区的农民，他们生活动荡不定，成分复杂，其特殊的生活产生了特定的文化形态，也产生了特定的音乐文化。《七十五天》这首经《美丽的哈瓦那》变化而成的歌曲即是一首历史悠久传唱至今的著名盲流歌曲。“文革”中，又出现了另一个极富特色的亚文化群——“知青”群体。他们特殊的非工、非农、非军、非学、非商的社会地位迅速呈现出其特殊的文化面貌。他们也具有自己的特殊的音乐文化——“知青歌曲”，除去部分外国民歌和应时歌曲外，《鸭绿江之夜》、《南京之歌》、《从北京到延安》、《重庆知青之歌》、《我是一个资本家的女儿》等创作歌曲成为“知青”独自拥有的日常歌曲。
    此外，必须注意到，中国还长期存在一个特殊的亚文化群体，这就是劳改和劳教人员。他们的生活环境的特殊性显而易见，而音乐生活是他们生活中很重要的一个部分。同样，他们除去一般歌曲外，也有着自己的创作歌曲和改编歌曲。
    《囚歌》等盒带的主体内容，正是上述盲流歌曲、知青歌曲及劳改人员歌曲的混合物。
    由此可见，上述歌曲尽管种类不一，情趣各异，却有几个共同的文化特点。第一，强烈的亚文化性。它一般地总与大文化构成强烈的反差，有时甚至以反文化的面貌出现。由于亚文化群的生活方式与社会一般群体之间的巨大差异，使其文化形态常常带有强烈的个性，有时候，这种个性甚至以敌对的方式表现出来。
    第二，这些歌曲在音乐形态上也往往以反现时音乐文化的特点出现。它往往采用过去的音乐材料与特定的演奏、演唱手段相结合，在创作中采取某种新的形式。如“知青”歌曲多从“文革”前创作中汲取强烈的抒情风格，甚至直接采用某一乐句作为主导动机。
    《我是一个资本家的女儿》取材于《远方的大雁》，《从北京到延安》取材于《红旗渠水绕太行》。这些风格与“文革”中的音乐风格形成反差。而《囚歌》等盒带歌曲则与当前歌坛的流行音乐风格形成对抗。虽然它也运用了流行音乐的形式，但其文化意识却无更多的创新，相反，只是一种倒退。
