Soviet Union Accuses Pakistani Forces of Fighting in Afghanistan
Pakistan Expresses Regret

ISLAMABAD, March 19 (Xinhua) — Pakistan expressed regret on March 18 over the accusations made by the Soviet Union.

Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan, Vorontsov, accused on March 16 in Kabul that Pakistani forces are fighting on Afghan territory and that Pakistani officers are commanding the Afghan Mujahideen in their battles against the Kabul government's forces.

A spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry stated late on March 18 that the Soviet accusations are groundless. He said that the Pakistani government has always adhered to the Geneva Accords on the Afghan issue because it contains a comprehensive solution including the restoration of the Afghan people's right to self-determination.

The spokesman said that Vorontsov's description of the current situation in Afghanistan as the beginning of a Pakistan-Afghanistan war is worrying.

He said that the Soviet Union not only transferred a large amount of weapons to the Kabul government before its withdrawal but also continues to provide military aid, which makes people truly doubt the Soviet envoy's statements about peace.

　　苏联指责巴部队在阿参战
    巴基斯坦表示遗憾
    新华社伊斯兰堡３月１９日电  巴基斯坦１８日对苏联的指责表示遗憾。
    苏联外交部第一副部长兼苏驻阿富汗大使沃龙佐夫３月１６日在阿首都喀布尔指责巴基斯坦部队正在阿富汗领土上打仗，并说巴军官在指挥阿圣战者游击队同喀布尔政权的军队作战。
    巴基斯坦外交部一位发言人１８日晚间在此间发表谈话说，苏联方面的指责毫无根据。他说，巴政府一直信守关于阿富汗问题的日内瓦协议，因为它包含着基于恢复阿富汗人民自决权在内的全面解决办法。
    这位发言人说，沃龙佐夫把阿当前的局势描述为巴基斯坦—阿富汗战争之始，这种说法令人担心。
    他说，苏联不仅在撤军前向喀布尔政权移交了大量军火，而且继续向它提供军事援助，这使人们对苏联这位使节关于和平的表白产生了真正的怀疑。
