    Today, the domestic economic section on the fifth page of this newspaper published an article by the Minister of the Forestry Department, Gao Dezhan, titled "Reflections on the Joys and Sorrows of Forestry." The article argues that China's forestry industry has more sorrows than joys, with a crisis in forest resources and economic difficulties in the forestry sector. It also introduces the Forestry Department's work objectives and four transformations.

    The article points out that China's forestry industry has made significant progress in recent years, but it still faces many challenges. The country's forest resources are in a state of crisis, with deforestation and desertification becoming increasingly severe. The economic situation in the forestry sector is also difficult, with many forestry enterprises facing financial difficulties.

    To address these challenges, the Forestry Department has proposed four transformations:

    1. Transforming the mode of forestry development: From extensive management to intensive management, from relying on natural resources to relying on scientific and technological progress.

    2. Transforming the structure of forestry products: From focusing on timber to diversifying into ecological, economic, and social benefits.

    3. Transforming the management system: From a highly centralized system to a more decentralized and market-oriented system.

    4. Transforming the concept of forestry development: From short-term gains to long-term sustainable development.

    The article emphasizes that these transformations are necessary for the sustainable development of China's forestry industry. It calls on all sectors of society to work together to implement these transformations and to promote the healthy development of China's forestry industry.
