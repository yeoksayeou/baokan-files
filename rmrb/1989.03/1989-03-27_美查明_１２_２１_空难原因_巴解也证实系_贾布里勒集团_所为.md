The Sunday Times, published early in Britain, reported today that U.S. intelligence agencies have identified the individuals responsible for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie on December 21 last year.

The newspaper said the organization behind the bombing is the Abu Nidal-led Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command.

The report stated that senior officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization have confirmed this information. They are convinced that the bomb used in the plane was "manufactured and placed by the Abu Nidal group."

The United States has urged relevant intelligence agencies in Western European countries to arrest the identified individuals and hand them over to the United States for trial.

    该报说，炸机背后的组织是贾布里勒领导的解放巴勒斯坦人民阵线（总指挥部）。
    报道说，巴勒斯坦解放组织的高级官员已证实这一消息。他们确信，炸机的炸弹是“贾布里勒集团制造和安放的”。
    美国已敦促西欧各国的有关情报机构逮捕已验明的炸机人员并送交美国审判。
