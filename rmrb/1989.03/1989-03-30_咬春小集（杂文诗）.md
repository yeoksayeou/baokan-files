The Spring Biting Collection (Miscellaneous Poetry)

    I
    A true gentleman dares to reveal his most hidden and dirty ailments to others;
    A true beauty is ashamed to use makeup to exaggerate her charm;
    A true hero does not hide his momentary fright when suddenly encountering a hungry tiger;
    A true strong person who can rise from defeat is willing to throw himself into the fiery furnace of molten gold and stone. What will rise in the great fire is a phoenix with fiery wings, a phoenix of youth.

    II
    You point out that my shoes are too dirty and need to be wiped clean? Very well, very well. I accept advice readily, which shows my magnanimity.
    And you, who love to meddle in others' shoes, go to the street to polish shoes. Everyone should do what they are good at, which shows my ability to recognize talent and assign tasks.

    III
    The Creator only placed eyes in the front of people's heads, and the cars behind are not visible.
    When you turn around, the back becomes the front, and everything is no longer the same as it was behind you.
    Otherwise, people would see: behind them, others are winking, gnashing their teeth, scraping faces, spitting, smearing mud on their backs, and raising black gun barrels...

    Merciful and benevolent Creator!

    IV
    Ask a certain mountain: Your lofty and rugged peaks can match Mount Tai, and your unique beauty is not inferior to Mount Emei. But on the map, your image is not drawn, and in the list of famous mountains, your name is not written. What do you think, brother?

    The mountain answers: I am still as high as ever, not an inch shorter.

    V
    Not everyone's life is precious.
    If time is compared to fire, some lives are like a piece of paper thrown into it, which, although written with many solemn praises, turns into ashes in an instant.
    Some are even worse, perhaps a piece of ragged cloth, which, when burned, emits a foul smell that makes one cover their nose.

    VI
    Roads are created by people.
    Primitive people walked out of places with no roads, encountering countless thorns, boulders, cliffs, valleys, snakes, wolves...
    Roads must extend to places with no roads.
    The great path is like a dream, and crying over a bleeding foot is cowardice. To keep going, one needs sweat, blood, and the endless song of toil.

    [Postscript] Spring biting is an old custom. It refers to eating radishes on the day of the spring equinox. At this time, fruits are expensive, so one can only settle for radishes, which aligns with the old custom. Although the taste is pungent, it moistens the intestines and clears the fire, which is one effect. While nibbling on the "heart's delight," one can casually write down some words that are neither sweet nor sour nor spicy, rambling and disorderly, and call it the "Spring Biting Collection." As for the spring that is not radish, it is lush and green, permeating the world. Even if one's mouth is as big as a hippopotamus, how can one bite it? I humbly add a few words, so as not to be misleading.

### 咬春小集（杂文诗）

　　咬春小集（杂文诗）
    一
    真的洁士，敢以己身最不洁之隐疾示人；
    真的美人，羞于以脂粉夸饰妖娆；
    真的好汉，不讳言猝遇饿虎时的片时惊悸；
    真正能够从挫败中奋起的强者，乐于投身于流金铄石的烈火。在大火中飞起的将是扇着火色翅膀的、青春的凤凰。
    　　　　二
    你指出我的鞋子太脏，该擦一擦吗？很好很好。从谏如流，足见我宽宏大量。
    而你，爱管别人的鞋子，请到街头去擦皮鞋。人尽其才，足见我知人善任。
    　　　　三
    造物者只在人们头的前部安放眼睛，身子后面的车是看不见的。
    待转过身去，背后又变成面前，一切车都不再是在背后的原样了。
    否则，人们会看到：身背后的人对着自己，怎样挤眉弄眼，怎样咬牙切齿，怎样刮脸皮，怎样吐唾沫，怎样把污泥涂在自己的背上，怎样举起黑洞洞的枪口……
    深仁厚泽的造物者哟！
    　　　　四
    问某山：你的高峻可匹泰山，奇秀不让峨眉，可是地图上不画你的形象，名山谱里不写你的名字，老兄作何感想？
    某山答：我还是那么高，没有矮一分。
    　　　　五
    并非所有人的生命都是可贵的。
    把时间比作火，有的生命如同投入其中的一张纸，那纸上虽然写着许多庄严的颂词，却顷刻化为灰烬。
    有的呀更那个，可能是一团破布，烧起来还发出令人掩鼻的臭味。
    　　　　六
    路是人类走出来的。
    初民从没有路的地方走出路来，曾遇到过多少荆棘，多少顽石，多少断崖，多少深谷，多少蛇蝎，多少虎狼……
    路要向没有路的地方伸展。
    大道直如发是梦幻，抱着扎破了的脚哭泣是怯懦。要走下去，需要的是热汗。是鲜血。是不舍昼夜的杭育杭育的浩歌。
    〔附记〕咬春者，旧俗也。指立春之日吃萝卜。时值初春，水果昂贵，只好退而求其次，以萝卜代之，与旧俗正合。味虽辛辣，而润肠清火，其效一也。一边啃着“心里美”，一边随手写下一些不甜不酸也不怎么辣的话，东拉西扯，全无伦次，命曰“咬春小集”。至于那并非萝卜之春，则郁郁葱葱，弥漫寰宇，小可之口纵大如河马，安可得而咬之哉？谨赘片言，庶不致误。
