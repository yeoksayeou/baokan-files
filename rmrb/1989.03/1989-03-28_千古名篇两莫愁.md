	Mo Qiu is a young woman who has been sung by poets throughout history. The two Mo Qius, one from Luoyang and the other from Han, have distinct personalities and are vividly portrayed.

	The Mo Qiu who lived in Shicheng was a real person. The Song Dynasty scholar Guo Maoqian, in his "Yuefu Shiji," quotes from the "Tangshu Lezhi" (Tang Dynasty Music Records): "In Shicheng, there was a woman named Mo Qiu who was good at singing folk songs." This is sufficient evidence. The location of Shicheng is now in Zhongxiang County, Hubei Province. This place was on the east bank of the Han River, and during the early Western Jin Dynasty, it was a frontier area between the Jin and Wu military forces. The Jin military commander Yang Hu used the mountain as a stronghold and built a city wall, naming it Shicheng. Two poems from the Six Dynasties period, "Mo Qiu Yue," have been passed down: one is "Where is Mo Qiu? Mo Qiu is in the west of Shicheng. The boat paddles two oars, urging Mo Qiu to come"; the other is "Hearing the joy of descending to Yangzhou, bidding farewell at the head of Chu Mountain. Reaching out to embrace the waist and look, the river water will not flow." The first poem depicts a lively and joyful young girl, whose image is vivid; the second poem deeply expresses the girl's tender farewell emotions with her lover, which is touching.

	"The Mo Qiu Yue" describes Mo Qiu's lover traveling by boat down the Han River to Yangzhou (present-day Nanjing), but it does not explain the continuation of the girl's life. The late Tang Dynasty poet Zheng Gu, passing through Shicheng, wrote a poem expressing his feelings: "Shicheng was once the hometown of Mo Qiu, but Mo Qiu's spirit has scattered in the desolate Shicheng." Comparing the subsequent lines of the poem, it seems that Mo Qiu was filled with longing and remained faithful to the end of her life. Another poet, Wei Zhuang, recalled his youthful social life in Chang'an, with the line "The beautiful woman of the south should be Mo Qiu," which was merely a borrowed name for a person, not related to the historical figure.

	Emperor Wu of the Liang Dynasty, Xiao Yan, sang of another Mo Qiu who lived in Luoyang. This Luoyang Mo Qiu loved labor and was skilled in handicrafts. Later, she married early and had children, relying on her husband's family, leading a materially rich but spiritually empty life. By the Tang Dynasty, the poet Shen Quanqi, in his poem "Ancient Feelings," supplemented and developed the image of this Lu family young woman: her husband was stationed far away in Liaoxi, and had not returned for ten years, leaving her alone in the southern part of Chang'an, living a lonely life in an empty bedroom.

	The authors of the folk songs and Xiao Yan each sang of a girl named Mo Qiu, but neither mentioned that the two grew up in Jianye or moved to Jinling after marriage. However, why is Mo Qiu associated with Nanjing, and why is she famous for this place? This is because people confused Shicheng with Shitou City. The Song Dynasty poet Zhou Bangyan, in his "Gold Mountain Remembrance of the Past," traced the ruins of Shitou City behind Qingliang Mountain, imagining: "The cliff trees are still leaning, the Mo Qiu boat was once tied." Through transmission and influence, the association deepened. "Jiangnan is a land of beautiful women, Jinling is the imperial capital," Mo Qiu, a beautiful woman of the past, and the Six Dynasties' golden dust of Nanjing, naturally came together on the basis of a mistaken identity.

### 千古名篇两莫愁

　　千古名篇两莫愁
    莫愁，是历代诗家迭相吟咏的年轻女性。洛、汉异流，风骚各领，形象都十分鲜活。
    家住石城的莫愁，是真实人物。宋人郭茂倩《乐府诗集》引《唐书·乐志》文字：“石城有女子，名莫愁，善歌谣”，由此足证。石城故址，当今湖北省钟祥县城。此处系汉江东岸一片荒坡，西晋初，属晋、吴军事对峙的前哨地带。晋军统帅羊祜，因山为固，筑起城垣，即以石城为名。六朝乐府诗今传《莫愁乐》两首，一为“莫愁在何处？莫愁石城西。艇子打两桨，催送莫愁来”；一为“闻欢下扬州，相送楚山头。探手抱腰看，江水断不流”。前首写少女活泼欢乐，形象栩栩如生；后首则深沉表达少女与少男依依临别情愫，真挚感人。
    《莫愁乐》写出莫愁的恋人旅向，是乘舟由汉下江，远赴扬州（今南京），对女主人公生平续志，没有交代。晚唐诗人郑谷，路过石城，题诗达情：“石城昔为莫愁乡，莫愁魂散石城荒”。参比后面诗句，看来，莫愁是别恨绵绵，守志终生的。另一诗人韦庄，诗忆年轻时在长安的社交生活，有“南国佳人当莫愁”之句，那不过是借名寓人，不涉及历史上的实在人物。
    梁武帝萧衍的《河中之水歌》，咏赞的是家住洛阳的另一个莫愁。这位洛阳莫愁，爱劳动，工手艺。后来，早婚早育，依傍丈夫门户，走上了物质富有却精神空虚的生活道路。到了唐朝，诗人沈佺期在《古意》诗中，对这卢家少妇的形象，做了补充发展：丈夫远戍辽西，十年未归，独居长安城南，过着空闺寂寞的日子。
    乐府诗作者和萧衍，各自咏赞了一个名叫莫愁的少女，也都没有任何内涵涉及到她俩生长在建业或是随嫁到金陵。但何以莫愁挂在了南京，而且盛名为此处所独擅？这是由于人们把石头城混于石城之故。宋朝词人周邦彦的《金陵怀古》一词，追踪到清凉山后的石头城荒址，悬想到：“断崖树，犹倒倚，莫愁艇子曾系”。辗转传被，影响加深。“江南佳丽地，金陵帝王州”，莫愁一代佳人，南京六朝金粉，很自然地在阴差阳错的基础上，联结到了一起。
