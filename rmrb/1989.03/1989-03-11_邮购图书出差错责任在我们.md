Edition: 6

Your newspaper published a letter from a reader on December 7 last year on the fifth page titled “Mail-ordered Books Not Received in Two Years, No Refund Either.” Upon investigation, we found that the situation described in the letter is true, and the responsibility for this problem lies with us.

Our department's leadership has seriously criticized the relevant personnel involved, and compensation has been provided to the reader for their losses. We are determined to continuously improve our work and ensure that books are delivered to readers in a timely manner.

　　邮购图书出差错责任在我们
    你报去年１２月７日第五版刊登了《邮购图书近两年，不见书也未退款》的读者来信。经查，来信反映的情况属实，出现这一问题的责任在我们。
    我部领导人已严肃地批评了有关经办人，对读者的损失给予了赔偿。我们决心不断改进工作，把图书及时送到读者手里。
