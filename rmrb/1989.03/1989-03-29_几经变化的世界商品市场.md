The world commodity market in 1988 was characterized by strong demand and rising prices. This year, the demand for commodities is expected to continue increasing, but due to various reasons, the upward trend in prices will not be as strong as last year. However, prices will remain at a relatively high level. In the second half of the year, prices of primary products may soften, but they will not plummet.

Since the 1980s, the world commodity market has undergone several twists and turns. In 1988, the market was characterized by strong demand and significant price increases following the sharp rise in 1987. The overall upward trend in prices in 1989 will not be as strong as in 1988, but prices will remain at a relatively high level.

According to recent figures from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the volume of world trade in 1988 increased by 8.5% compared to the previous year, more than double the average annual growth rate of the 1980s. Due to price increases, the value of world trade in 1988 increased by 14% compared to the previous year, reaching a record $2.84 trillion. However, the price changes of different types of commodities varied. For example, looking at the two major categories of primary products and industrial manufactured goods in world trade, according to the World Primary Commodity Price Index (excluding oil and coal) published by the International Monetary Fund and calculated in dollars, the average price in 1988 increased by 23.4% compared to the previous year. Among the major primary products, the prices of nickel, zinc, and linseed oil saw the largest increases, followed by corn, wheat, sugar, aluminum, soybeans, and peanuts. In the industrial manufactured goods sector, prices have also risen since 1988, with methanol, toluene, urea, steel bars, and cold-rolled steel plates seeing the most significant increases.

The continued significant price increases in the world commodity market in 1988 were due to multiple factors, but the main reason was the sharp increase in market demand. The supply of many commodities has tightened, and some have even experienced a sustained shortage of spot supplies. Specifically, the following factors contributed to this situation:

First, the economies of the West, particularly the United States and Japan, showed strong growth in 1988. According to reports, the economic growth rate of the 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, including major Western industrial countries, reached 4% in 1988, the fastest pace since 1984, with the U.S. economy growing by 3.9% and Japan by 5.8%. In this context, fixed capital investment and personal consumption expenditures in some major Western countries increased significantly in 1988. This situation led to a sharp increase in demand and consumption in the commodity market, particularly for important raw materials and industrial manufactured goods such as nickel, zinc, aluminum, wool, steel, mechanical and electrical products, and many chemical products.

Second, due to price declines in previous years, some producing countries were forced to reduce production or significantly cut production capacity, making it difficult to quickly restore production.

Third, in the summer of 1988, North America experienced a severe drought not seen in nearly 50 years, leading to a significant reduction in the production of important agricultural products, particularly grains and soybeans.

Additionally, speculative activities in some countries were rampant, which was another important factor contributing to the sharp increase in commodity prices.

Of course, due to increased production or reduced demand, some commodities experienced price declines in 1988, such as oil, cotton, tea, coffee, jute, leather, and cotton fabrics. Despite this, the overall trend in the world commodity market in 1988 was upward.

Currently, it is estimated that the demand for commodities in the world market in 1989, particularly for important industrial raw materials and manufactured goods, will continue to increase. The International Monetary Fund recently predicted that the volume of world trade will grow by 5% to 6% in 1989. At the same time, the production of certain products is constrained by various factors, and Western factories and mines are currently cautious about resuming and expanding production. Therefore, the supply situation is expected to remain tight for some time. Although the economic growth rate of Western industrial countries may slow down again in 1989, and some products may experience price declines due to increased production and supply or deepening of existing supply surpluses, the overall trend in prices will not be as strong as in 1988. However, in 1989, especially in the near term, commodity prices in the world market, including prices of primary products and industrial manufactured goods, are expected to remain and fluctuate at the current high levels. In the second half of the year, prices of primary products may soften, but they will not experience a sharp decline.

　　几经变化的世界商品市场
    内容提要：去年，世界商品市场的一个重要特点是需求旺盛，价格上升。今年对商品的需求将继续增加，由于各种原因，价格上升的趋势将不如去年强劲，但仍将保持在较高水平上。下半年初级产品价格可能见软，但也不至于剧跌。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    ８０年代以来，世界商品市场的变动几经曲折。去年，世界商品市场的一个重要特点是需求旺盛，价格继１９８７年出现激涨后又有大幅度上升。１９８９年内总的价格上升趋势将不如１９８８年强劲，但仍将保持在较高水平上。
    据关税及贸易总协定最近公布的数字，１９８８年世界贸易量较上年增长８．５％，超过了８０年代以来平均年增长率的一倍还多；由于价格上升，１９８８年世界贸易额较上年增长了１４％，达创纪录的２８４００亿美元。但各类商品价格的变化仍有所不同。如以世界贸易中初级产品和工业制成品两大类产品来看，据国际货币基金组织编制发表的、以美元计算的世界初级产品价格指数（不含石油及煤），１９８８年全年平均较上年升２３．４％。在主要初级产品中，尤以镍、锌和亚麻油等价格上涨幅度最大，其次为玉米、小麦、糖、铝、大豆和花生等。在工业制成品方面，１９８８年以来也有所上升，其中尤以甲醇、甲苯、尿素、钢筋和冷轧卷钢板等价格上涨最为突出。
    １９８８年世界商品市场价格继续出现大幅上升，原因是多方面的，但主要是由于市场需求剧增，不少商品的供应趋紧，有的甚至出现现货供应持续紧张。具体说来，则主要是由以下一些因素造成：
    一、西方经济、特别是美国和日本经济１９８８年呈现强劲增长。据报道，１９８８年包括西方各主要工业国家在内的经合组织２４个成员国的经济增长率达４％，增速较１９８４年以来的任何时候都快，其中美国经济增长３．９％，日本５．８％。在此情况下，１９８８年西方一些主要国家的固定资本投资和个人消费开支分别都有明显增长。这种情况引起对商品市场、特别是对一些重要原料和工业制成品如镍、锌、铝、羊毛、钢材、机电产品和许多化工品等消费和需求的急剧增长。
    二、一些商品因前些年价格下跌，一些生产国被迫压缩生产或大量削减生产能力，现在一时很难恢复。
    三、１９８８年夏，北美出现近５０年来未遇的严重干旱，致使一些重要农产品、特别是粮谷和大豆等产量剧减。
    此外，有些国家投机活动十分猖獗，也是加剧商品价格上涨的一个重要原因。
    当然，由于产品的产量增加，或因需求不振，供应有所过剩，１９８８年也有一些商品价格仍有下跌，如石油、棉花、茶叶、咖啡、黄麻、牛皮和棉布等。尽管如此，１９８８年世界商品市场价格变动的总趋势仍是上升的。
    从目前情况来看，１９８９年世界市场对商品的需求，特别是对一些重要工业原料和制成品的需求估计将继续增加。国际货币基金组织最近预计，１９８９年世界贸易量将再增长５％至６％。与此同时，某些产品的生产由于受种种因素制约，特别是西方一些厂矿目前对恢复和扩大生产仍在一定程度上持谨慎态度，其供应紧张的情况估计一时也仍难有很大改观。因此，１９８９年尽管西方工业国家的经济增长速度有可能重新放慢，有些产品由于生产和供应增加或原来就存在的供应过剩的加深，价格有可能出现转跌或续跌，价格总的发展趋势将不如１９８８年那样强劲。但１９８９年，特别是近期内，世界商品市场价格，包括初级产品和工业制成品价格，总的看来，似仍将分别保持并徘徊在当前较高的水平；下半年初级产品价格可能见软，但也不至于急剧下跌。
