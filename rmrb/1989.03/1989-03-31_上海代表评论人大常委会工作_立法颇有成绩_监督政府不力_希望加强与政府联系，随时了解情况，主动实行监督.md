Shanghai delegates have commented on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, praising its legislative achievements while criticizing its lack of supervision over the government. They hope to strengthen the committee's ties with the government to better understand situations and conduct proactive supervision.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 30 (Reporters Li Keyong and Wu Shishen), the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has not effectively supervised the government's work and the implementation of laws over the past year, falling short of expectations and failing to satisfy the public.

This was a sharp criticism raised by some Shanghai delegates during the review of the Standing Committee's work report at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, despite their acknowledgment of the committee's legislative achievements.

Chen Deming, vice-chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said that the national economic plan, which delegates approved by a show of hands last year, has deviated significantly in its actual implementation. Industrial growth exceeded the plan by more than onefold, currency issuance exceeded the plan by over 50%, investment scale exceeded the plan by over 30%, and the price index exceeded the tolerance of all parties. The Standing Committee obviously failed to effectively supervise these issues, falling short of expectations.

Recently, 30 Shanghai delegates submitted a joint letter to the presidium of the session, raising five questions about the deviation in the implementation of the national economic plan, the effectiveness of the State Council's institutional reforms, the implementation of the Enterprise Law and Bankruptcy Law, the rectification and cleaning up of companies, and whether to conduct supervision and evaluation of state leaders elected by the people. They requested explanations.

The delegates pointed out that the Standing Committee currently only listens to reports after the fact, remaining in a passive state. It should actively identify problems, make resolutions, and correct them in a timely manner.

Wu Chenghui, a member of the editorial board of the Wenhui Evening News, said that some delegates proposed setting up new supervisory bodies. In fact, the specialized committees of the Standing Committee should be supervisory bodies. Whether new ones are set up or not, the key is for the Standing Committee to shift from passive supervision to proactive supervision.

How can the Standing Committee increase its vitality and effectively carry out supervision? The delegates had various opinions. Many delegates emphasized that the Standing Committee must gradually abandon the practice of treating it as an honorary body and turn it into a permanent, full-time working body. It should strengthen its ties with the government, stay informed of situations at all times, and conduct supervision.

Some delegates suggested that within the scope of the Constitution, the relationship between the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Democratic Parties, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the National People's Congress should be further adjusted and clarified. Specific supervisory procedures and systems for the Standing Committee should be established, and relevant regulations should be formulated.

Some delegates proposed that the speeches and voting records of each member of the Standing Committee should be recorded and made public or reported to the delegates, so that the people can understand their political views.

　　上海代表评论人大常委会工作        
    立法颇有成绩　监督政府不力        
    希望加强与政府联系，随时了解情况，主动实行监督
    据新华社北京３月３０日电  （记者李克勇、吴士深）全国人大常委会在过去一年里对政府工作和法律实施方面监督不力，有负众望，不能令人满意。
    这是人大七届二次会议部分上海代表在审议人大常委会工作报告时提的尖锐批评，尽管代表们对人大常委会在立法方面做出的成绩加以赞赏。
    上海市侨联副主席陈德明代表说，去年代表们举手通过的国民经济计划在实际执行中出现很大偏差，工业速度超出一倍多，货币发行超计划５０％以上，投资规模超计划３０％以上，物价指数超出各方面承受能力，人大常委会对上述问题显然未能有效监督，有负众望。
    ３０位上海代表日前还就国民经济计划执行偏差、国务院机构改革是否有成效、企业法和破产法执行情况、整顿清理公司情况和对选举产生的国家领导人是否进行监督评议五个问题，向会议主席团递交了联名信，要求作出说明。
    代表们指出，人大常委会目前仅限于事后听取汇报这一种监督形式，处于消极状态；应该积极发现问题，做出决议，及时纠正。
    《新民晚报》编委吴承惠代表说，有的代表提出设立新的监督机构，其实人大常委会的专门委员会就应是监督机构。新设也好，不设也好，关键是人大常委会要变被动监督为主动监督。
    人大常委会怎样才能增加活力，有效地实行监督？代表们对此各抒己见。不少代表强调，必须逐步摆脱把人大常委会当作荣誉性机构的作法，使人大常委会成为常设专职工作机构，加强与政府联系，随时了解情况，进行监督。
    有的代表提出，应该在宪法范围内，进一步调整理顺中共中央、民主党派、政协与人大之间的相互关系，具体确立人大常委会的监督程序和制度，制定有关条例。
    有的代表建议，对每一位人大常委会委员会议发言和表决情况记录在案，公之于众，或通报代表，使人民了解他的政见。
