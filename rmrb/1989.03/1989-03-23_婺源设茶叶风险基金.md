Wuyuan Establishes Tea Leaf Risk Fund

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanchang on March 22, (correspondent Li Qingping, reporter Chen Yao) Jiangxi Province's Wuyuan County will establish a tea leaf risk fund starting this year to subsidize tea farmers in case of tea leaf backlog or when tea prices fall below the current protection price.

Wuyuan County produces 525 million kilograms of green tea annually, with 90% exported overseas. Last year, it earned 11 million US dollars in foreign exchange. However, due to the fluctuating international market, tea farmers' interests are often affected if tea leaves are backlogged. To address this, the county has decided to allocate half of the annual tea leaf export earnings to the tea leaf risk fund.

　　婺源设茶叶风险基金
    据新华社南昌３月２２日电  （通讯员李清萍、记者陈瑶）江西省婺源县从今年起设立茶叶风险基金，以便茶叶滞销或茶价低于现行保护价时补贴茶农。
    婺源县年产绿茶５２５万公斤，９０％销往海外，去年创汇１１００万美元。但是，由于国际市场风云变幻，一旦茶叶滞销，茶农利益往往受损。为此，该县决定，将今后每年茶叶出口创汇分成额的一半列入茶叶风险基金。
