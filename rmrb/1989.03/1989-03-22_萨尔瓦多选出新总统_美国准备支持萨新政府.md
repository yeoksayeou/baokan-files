El Salvador Elects New President
U.S. Ready to Support New Salvadoran Government

Caracas, March 20 (Xinhua) — According to local television reports, the preliminary results of El Salvador's election were announced today. The candidate of the Nationalist Republican Alliance, Cristiani, declared that he had won 54% of the votes. Meanwhile, the candidate of the ruling Christian Democratic Party, Menendez, formally acknowledged his defeat and congratulated Cristiani.

Cristiani stated after his victory that his government would continue to seek negotiations with the guerrilla organization Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front to end the civil war and achieve peace.

The guerrilla forces in El Salvador boycotted the election and engaged in clashes with government troops in over 20 locations across the country on election day. The closest clash to the capital, San Salvador, was just 15 kilometers away. However, the guerrillas announced two days before the election that they would not attack polling stations and would not retaliate against those who participated in the election.

Cristiani is 42 years old. The Nationalist Republican Alliance, to which he belongs, was founded in 1981. This party is closely linked to the "Death Squads" organization, which frequently carries out terrorist assassinations. During his campaign, Cristiani tried to present a moderate image and attempted to change the party's image. Nevertheless, many people still believe that his election will make the situation in El Salvador more complicated.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 20 — U.S. State Department spokesman Redman today stated that the United States is prepared to support the leader of El Salvador "produced by democratic procedures." However, he added that the relationship between the United States and the new Salvadoran government would depend on the government's performance in terms of democracy and human rights.

　　萨尔瓦多选出新总统        
    美国准备支持萨新政府
    本报加拉加斯３月２０日电  记者朱满庭报道：据此间电视台报道，萨尔瓦多大选今天初步揭晓，民族主义共和联盟候选人克里斯蒂亚尼宣布获得选票的５４％，与此同时，执政的基督教民主党候选人梅纳则正式承认竞选失败，并向克里斯蒂亚尼表示祝贺。
    克里斯蒂亚尼在当选后称，他的政府将继续寻求与游击队组织法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线进行谈判，争取结束内战，实现和平。
    萨尔瓦多游击队组织抵制这次选举，并在选举日与政府军在全国２０多处交火，交火地点离首都圣萨尔瓦多最近的只有１５公里，但游击队在选举前两天正式宣布将不袭击投票点，也不会对参加选举的人施行报复。
    克里斯蒂亚尼今年４２岁。他所属的民族主义共和联盟，是１９８１年创建的，这个党与经常进行恐怖暗杀活动的“敢死队”组织联系密切。克里斯蒂亚尼在竞选中竭力表现出温和色彩，力图改变该党的形象。尽管如此，不少人还是认为他的当选将使萨尔瓦多的局面更加复杂化。
    据新华社华盛顿３月２０日电　美国国务院发言人雷德曼今天表示，美国准备支持萨尔瓦多“由民主程序产生的领导人”。但他又说，美国与萨尔瓦多新政府的关系将取决于该政府在民主和人权方面的表现。
