Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 12th. (Reporter Cáo Shàopíng) This year, China's rural economy has shown three new trends: a shift from cold to warm in agricultural development; a sustained high growth rate in township enterprises; and nearly ten million migrant workers facing new employment choices.

	According to various regional reports, the calls to revitalize agriculture in recent years have begun to take concrete actions this year. Measures to increase agricultural investment are being implemented. In addition to increased financial investments from the central and local governments, various regions are actively raising funds and establishing agricultural development funds, with an estimated additional 500 million yuan this year. The agricultural loans from the Agricultural Bank and credit cooperatives are also planned to increase significantly. The rise in market prices for grain and oil, along with the central government's decision to raise the procurement prices for contracted grain and oil, has to some extent stimulated farmers' enthusiasm. Local party and government departments are beginning to refocus their work on agriculture. The scale and effect of agricultural infrastructure construction this winter and spring are among the best in recent years. The summer grain sowing area has increased, and despite shortages in fertilizers, agricultural films, and seeds, the overall situation is better than last year, making a good harvest for summer grain and oil possible.

	According to surveys from various regions, despite severe difficulties in funding, energy, and raw materials, township enterprises, with the full support of local governments, their own efforts, and various forms of fundraising, have significantly eased these difficulties and maintain strong development capabilities. In the first two months of this year, township enterprises nationwide continued to develop at a high rate of over twenty percent. Experts believe that the strong development capability of township enterprises mainly comes from the collective determination of enterprise employees to overcome difficulties together, which is truly admirable. However, there are concerns about whether the fundraising by township enterprises will affect the overall economic rectification of the country.

	Another prominent trend this year is that nearly ten million migrant workers are facing new employment choices, and the transfer of surplus rural labor is encountering new challenges. According to estimates, out of the 90 million farmers who have already transferred from agriculture to the secondary and tertiary industries, nearly 10 million will face new employment choices this year. Especially for those who have gone to cities for work or business, due to the reduction in urban construction scale and the decrease in non-planned employment, several million will return to rural areas. The return of a large number of farmers will not only directly affect their income and living conditions but may also bring about some social problems. How to help these returning farmers choose new employment projects and prevent them from returning to the already crowded farmland is an important issue facing rural economic work at present. According to estimates, the number of migrant workers returning in 1990 will not be less than this year.

　　农村经济出现三个新动向
    为农业加温开始见诸行动     
    乡镇企业一二月速度仍高
    近千万务工经商农民回流
    新华社北京３月１２日电  （记者曹绍平）今年我国农村经济出现三个新动向：办农业由冷变热；乡镇企业保持较高发展速度；近千万务工经商农民面临新的就业选择。
    综合各地动向，近年来为农业加温的呼吁，今年开始见诸行动。增加农业投入的各项措施正在落实，除中央和地方财政投入增加外，各地正抓紧通过各种渠道筹集和建立农业发展基金，预计今年又拿到５０多亿元。农业银行、信用社的农业贷款今年计划也有大幅度增加。粮食、油料市场价格的上涨，以及中央提高合同定购粮食、油料收购价格措施的出台，一定程度上刺激了农民的积极性。各地党政部门开始把工作重点重新转到农业上。去冬今春全国农田基本建设的规模和效果是近年来少有的。今年夏粮播种面积增加，春耕生产尽管化肥、农膜、良种等生产资料仍然不足，但总的形势好于去年，夺取今年夏季粮油丰收有望。
    据各地调查表明，面临资金、能源、原材料等严重困难的乡镇企业，因地方政府的全力支持，企业自身的努力，特别是通过各种形式集资，大大缓解了资金等困难，仍具有较强的发展能力。今年一、二月份全国乡镇企业仍以百分之二十几的较高速度发展。有关人士分析认为，乡镇企业较强的发展能力主要来自企业职工上下一致共渡难关的决心，其精神令人惊叹。但对乡镇企业集资会不会影响国家整个经济治理整顿担忧。
    今年一个突出的动向是，近千万务工经商农民面临新的就业选择，农村剩余劳力转移遇到新难题。据有关人士估计，目前，已从农业转移出来从事二、三产业的９０００万农民，今年将有近１０００万面临新的就业选择。特别是进城务工经商的农民，因城市基建规模的压缩、计划外用工的减少等原因，将有几百万返回农村。大批农民回流，不仅将直接影响这些人的收入和生活，而且还可能带来一些社会问题。如何帮助这批回流农民选择新的就业项目，不使他们重新回到已经十分拥挤的耕地上，是当前农村经济工作面临的一个重要课题。据有关人士预测，１９９０年务工经商的农民回流的人数不会低于今年。
