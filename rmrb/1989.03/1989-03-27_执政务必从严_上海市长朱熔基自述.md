	Governance Must Be Strict
	— Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji's Account
	Xinhua News Agency reporters: Wú Shìshēn  Lǐ Zhìyǒng

	A year ago, at the People's Congress, Zhu Rongji called out "Revitalize Shanghai's Spirit." After taking office as mayor, he experienced both sweetness and bitterness. At the small group meeting of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, he shared his feelings: governance must be strict!

	The reporters recorded Zhu Rongji's "account."

	My biggest realization as mayor is: unify thoughts, govern strictly. If everyone is nice and friendly, eating and drinking together, not offending anyone, then nothing will get done.

	Take the disorderly taxi industry in Shanghai, for example. At the beginning, revoking the licenses of four drivers who overcharged was difficult to implement. How can this be? I asked the heads of the three responsible departments where the problem was. Tomorrow, these four people's licenses must be revoked, and it must be reported in the newspapers. Whoever doesn't understand can come to me to discuss it. Now, over 100 licenses have been revoked, and the situation of excessive charging has improved.

	Last summer, the Shanghai Refrigerator Factory caught fire. I decided to remove the factory director. This caused a lot of talk. Some said this was "too much." The fire exposed the factory's management problems, and millions of state property were burned to ashes. I cannot compromise. Now, the workers in this factory pay more attention to safety. To manage Shanghai well, one must be resolute.

	Also, recently, a bus ticket seller beat up a pregnant woman. I saw the newspaper and wrote "harmful element, dismiss." But the public transportation department submitted a report "explaining," suggesting a "suspension of three months' bonus" punishment, and said "please decide, Mayor Zhu." Now, many things are like this, passing the buck layer by layer, not daring to offend anyone.

	Now we often complain about the "big environment" being bad, but actually, the "big environment" is created by the "small environment." If everyone comes together to strictly manage the "small environment," the "big environment" can change. Currently, rectification and order require us to govern strictly, with orders and laws being followed. We cannot say one thing and do another. We must grasp things solidly. Otherwise, even good policies will be useless.

### 执政务必从严  ——上海市长朱熔基自述

　　执政务必从严        
    ——上海市长朱熔基自述
    新华社记者  吴士深  李志勇
    一年前，在人代会上喊出“重振上海雄风”的朱熔基，上任市长后尝尽甜酸苦辣。在七届全国人大二次会议小组会上，他述说了自己的感受：执政务必从严！
    记者记录了朱熔基的“自述”。
    我当市长最大的体会就是：统一思想，从严执政。如果和和气气，吃吃喝喝，谁也不想得罪，那什么事也办不成。
    拿上海整顿秩序混乱的出租汽车业来说，刚开始时，要吊销四个乱收费司机的执照，就是难落实。这怎么行呢？我问三家主管部门负责人，卡在哪里？明天一定要吊销这四个人的执照，并要见报。谁想不通，到我这里讲道理。现在已吊销１００多个执照，漫天要价的情况有所收敛。
    去年夏天，上海电冰箱厂着火。我决定免除厂长职务。这一下不得了了，议论纷纷。有人说这样做“太过分”了。火灾暴露了工厂管理问题，几百万国家财产烧得精光。我不能让步。现在这个厂的职工很重视安全。要管好上海，不坚决是站不住的。
    还有，最近报载，一公共汽车售票员殴打孕妇。我看了报纸，批了“害群之马，开除”。但公交部门却打报告“解释”，建议作“停发三月奖金”处理，还说“请朱市长决定”。现在很多事就这样，层层开脱，不肯得罪人。
    现在我们常常抱怨“大气候”不好，其实，“大气候”是“小气候”造成的。如果大家都来从严治理“小气候”，“大气候”就能改变。当前治理整顿更需要我们从严执政，令出法随，不能讲一套，做又是另一套，必须扎扎实实抓。不然，有了好政策也没用。
