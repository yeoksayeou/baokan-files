	Movies: Can Make the Earth Smaller
		— An Interview with Wu Ziniu
		Li Tong

	Wu Ziniu, born in the Year of the Snake (36 years old), is from Leshan, Sichuan. After graduating from the Beijing Film Academy in 1982, he has worked as a film director, moving between the Xiangjiang Studio, the August First Studio, and the Fujian Studio. He has directed seven films: "Standby Team Member," "Bloodshed in Black Valley," "Dove Tree," "The Last Winter," "Evening Bell," "Happy Heroes," and "The Yin-Yang World."

	Reporter: Last year, Chen Kaige told me that you have had a lot of difficulties making films, but you still persist in making films according to your own choices. He respects you very much as a classmate. Now that you have won the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, what are your thoughts?

	Wu: I used to think, why do Chinese people need foreigners to affirm themselves? I never expected that it would happen to me. I don't expect the award to bring me anything; I will just continue to make films quietly. Next, I will return to the Xiangjiang Studio to shoot a film based on the novel "God Blows," titled "Five Villages." The male protagonist spans over 70 years, depicting the impact of modern China's numerous disasters and hardships on the lives of five men.

	Reporter: From your films, one can see a continuous focus on war. Why is that?

	Wu: War is a battlefield of life and death, where the sharpest questions of life can be revealed. War is detestable, filled with death and destruction, even the corpses are not spared. But within death, a kind of hope is born, and that is thought. My attitude towards war is this: if there is an invasion by a foreign enemy, I will unhesitatingly join the war of resistance. But if, before I die, I have the chance to express my last wish, I will say: I hate war! The vast cemetery in the Gobi Desert, the scene of Japanese people visiting the desolate graves in Henan, these experiences gave me a strong shock. I want to transcend the standpoint of a nation and look at war from the height of world culture. Why are there no names for any of the characters in "Evening Bell"? Because soldiers from any country in the world can play a role in it. Currently, I feel that making modern films is not as good as going back to find humanistic and historical roots. But if there is no deposit, no pull, it will be buried in history.

	Reporter: Is there a relationship between your experiences and your insistence on portraying war?

	Wu: Although our generation has not experienced real war, we have experienced another kind of war— the Anti-Rightist Movement and the Cultural Revolution, which cast shadows over our young hearts. They are also a destruction and devastation of people and human nature. Talking about experiences, I recall an interesting thing. When I was very young, the first movie that made me cry was "Twenty-Four Eyes" by the Japanese director Yasujirō Ozu. Now Mr. Ozu is over 70 years old. I heard that after he watched "Evening Bell," he stopped working on an anti-war film he was preparing to shoot, "The Oath on the Battlefield," because he thought "Evening Bell" had already expressed what he wanted to say.

	Reporter: It seems like you and Mr. Ozu have some kind of connection. In fact, it is the conscience of artists that can transcend nationality and also transcend the "generation gap." What are your views and pursuits regarding movies as art?

	Wu: If movies are truly art, they can make the earth a little smaller, and they can also make the earth cleaner and more beautiful. When I first went to the Film Academy, one morning I suddenly realized: I was born to make movies. A literary youth finally found his ideal career—movies. Its means are too rich; it can make your thoughts move, and it can express your understanding of life most fully. If my seven films have a common theme, it is: art for life. Movies have only a 100-year history, and in the future, it will be an amazing culture. A foreign reporter asked me which great directors I like? I said: For a period of time, we were influenced by Italian neorealism, but we quickly realized that their 10-year decline was inevitable. Antonioni is a master, he is profound to the extreme, and also simple to the extreme. There is also Bergman from Sweden, and the Soviet director who made "Andrei Rublev," Tarkovsky, who I admire. To be honest, I have liked Godard and Fellini, but I don't know what I like about them, and I'm not sure I can imitate them.

	Reporter: In your series of works, there are both commercially successful narrative films and "exploratory" films that do not focus on commercial benefits. What are your views on the current debate in the film industry about "entertainment films"?

	Wu: I don't want to get involved in theoretical arguments; I'll just cook some good dishes for everyone to taste. The style of a movie is a carrier, and I don't want to style for the sake of styling. For example, "Bloodshed in Black Valley" is a very "mainstream" movie, but it contains my inner monologue, such as the 48 shots of refugees, which contrast with the internal strife of the Chinese people in the film. I believe I can make very high-quality commercial films. But in the film, I must express my ideals to some extent; if not, I won't make it. Last year, someone offered a high fee to ask me to shoot a TV series, but I thought it was meaningless and declined. Doing something must have value. The process of shooting "Evening Bell" was very painful, but it had value. I don't want to make movies in a hurry for quick success. It's meaningless to be too utilitarian. I have no need to participate in the "entertainment film" discussion. I will use my works to prove: "entertainment films" and art films can be combined and coexist.

　　电影：可以使地球更小些
    ——访吴子牛
    李彤
    吴子牛，属蛇（３６岁），四川乐山人。１９８２年北京电影学院毕业后以电影导演为业，辗转于潇湘厂、八一厂和福建厂，拍摄了《候补队员》、《喋血黑谷》、《鸽子树》、《最后一个冬日》、《晚钟》、《欢乐英雄》和《阴阳界》７部影片。
    记者：去年陈凯歌曾对我说，你拍片很不顺利，但你仍然坚持按自己的选择默默地拍片，他很敬重你这个同学。现在你捧回了西柏林电影节的银熊奖，有何感想？
    吴：我原来想，中国人为什么一定要让外国人来肯定自己？没想到今天也落到我身上了。我不指望得奖给我带来什么，还是默默地拍片吧，下一步我将回潇湘厂拍根据小说《神吹》改编的《五合村》，男主人公跨度７０多年，描写多灾多难的近代中国对五条汉子人生的影响。
    记者：从你的影片中能看出一种绵延不断的对战争的关注，这是为什么？
    吴：战争是生死场，人生最尖锐的问题可以在这里得到揭示。战争是可憎的，充满了死亡、毁灭，甚至连尸体还要受到损害。但是在死亡里要诞生一种希望，这就是思想。我对战争的态度是这样的：如果有外敌入侵，我会毫不犹豫地投入卫国战争。但是在我临死前，如果还有机会表达自己的心愿的话，我会说：我憎恨战争！戈壁滩上一片全国最大的坟场，河南某地日本人前来凭吊荒坟的场面，这些见闻给了我强烈的震撼。我想跨越一个民族的立场，从世界文化的高度来看待战争。为什么《晚钟》里中日双方所有人物都没有姓名？因为世界任何一个国家的军人都可以到其中扮演一个角色。目前，我觉得拍现代题材不如回过头去寻找人文的、历史的植根，但如果没有一种寄托、一种牵引，就会埋葬在历史里。
    记者：你的经历与你执意要表现的战争有什么关系吗？
    吴：我们这一代人虽然没有经历过真正的战争，但经历过另一种人的战争——反右、“文革”，给幼小的心灵投下了阴影。它们同样都是对人、对人性的毁灭和摧残。说到经历，我想起一件很有趣的事，很小的时候看过的第一次让我流泪的电影，是日本导演木下惠介的《２４只眼睛》。如今木下先生已经７０多岁，听说他看了《晚钟》，把他正准备拍摄的一部反战影片《战场上的誓约》下马了，认为《晚钟》已经表达了他要说的意思。
    记者：你和木下先生好像有某种缘份，其实是艺术家的良知能够超越民族，也能够超越“代沟”。对于作为艺术的电影，你又有什么见解和追求？
    吴：电影如果真是艺术，它可以使地球变得更小一点，也可以使地球更干净更美丽一点。刚上电影学院的时候一天早上醒来，我突然明白：我这辈子就是该拍电影的。一个文学青年终于找到了理想的事业——电影。它的手段太丰富了，它能让你的思想动起来，把对生活的理解最充分地表现出来。如果说我的７部影片有什么主题贯穿的话，那就是：为人生而艺术。电影才１００年历史，再往下走，它会是了不起的一种文化。有外国记者问我喜欢哪些大导演？我说：我们在一段时间里受到意大利新现实主义电影的影响，但很快认识到他们１０年消亡是必然的。安东尼奥尼则是大师，他深刻到极点，也朴实到极点。还有瑞典的伯格曼、苏联导演过《安德列依·鲁勃廖夫》的塔尔科夫斯基，都让我佩服。实事求是地说，我曾喜欢戈达尔、费里尼，但不知道喜欢他们什么，未必能够效法。
    记者：在你的作品系列中，既有商业上很成功的情节片，也有不注重商业效益的“探索片”。那么你对目前电影界关于“娱乐片”的争论有什么见解？
    吴：我不愿意介入理论的争吵，还是炒些好点的菜让大家尝一尝吧。电影样式是一种载体，我不愿意为样式而样式。例如《喋血黑谷》是很“主流”的一部电影，但其中有我的内心独白，例如难民的４８个镜头，它与影片中中国人的内耗形成对比。我相信我这个人很能拍商业片，而且是高档的。但在片子里一定要或多或少地表达自己的理想，如果没有就不拍。去年曾有人出很高的报酬请我拍电视剧，我以为没有意义便谢绝了。做一件事绝对要有价值，拍《晚钟》的过程尽管很痛苦，但是有价值。我不愿意急功近利地拍电影，太功利了没意思。我没有任何必要去参加“娱乐片”讨论，我将用作品证明：“娱乐片”和艺术片是可以结合，可以兼顾并存的。
