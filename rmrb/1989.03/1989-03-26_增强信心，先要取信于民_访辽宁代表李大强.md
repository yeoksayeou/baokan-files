	Boosting Confidence Requires Gaining the Trust of the People
	—An Interview with Liaoning Representative Li Daqiang

	Reporter: Mo Xinyuan

	“Recently, you are going to Beijing to participate in politics and discussions, so I specially wrote this letter to you.”—Li Daqiang, the director of Shenyang Railway Bureau, who leads 400,000 workers, recently received a letter from a worker named “One Railway Worker.” The beginning of this letter is written like this. Li Daqiang brought this letter to Beijing and showed it to the reporter.

	The letter says that the public has the most complaints about the different levels of corruption among some of the country's management personnel and hopes that decisive measures will be taken to solve this problem. Administrative and economic measures are not effective, so legal measures must be used. If the punishment is too light, the public will be dissatisfied!

	Li Daqiang commented on this letter: “This letter reflects the views of a considerable number of workers. More importantly, the fact that this letter was written shows that the broad masses of workers still have confidence in us. But why is there resentment?

	The main reason is the unfair distribution and corruption, which have caused this. To invigorate the spirit of the people nationwide and boost their confidence, our leaders must first believe in the people. We must confidently talk about achievements, but we must also frankly discuss problems. To boost the people's confidence, we must first gain their trust.”

　　增强信心，先要取信于民        
    ——访辽宁代表李大强
    本报记者  莫新元
    “最近您要进京参政议政了，所以特给您写信。”——领导着４０万职工的沈阳铁路局局长、全国人大代表李大强，不久前收到署名“一铁路职工”的来信。这封信的开头，就是这样写的。李大强把这封信带到了北京，展示在记者面前。
    来信说，群众对国家的一些管理人员中存在的不同程度的腐败现象，意见最大，希望下狠心加以解决。用行政手段和经济手段不行，就要用法律手段。处理轻了老百姓有气！
    李大强这样评价这封信：“这封信反映了相当一部分工人群众的看法。更为重要的是，写这封信本身，说明了广大工人群众对我们还是抱有信心的。但为什么会产生怨气呢？
    主要是分配不公和腐败现象等问题引起的。要使全国人民振奋精神，增强信心，我们的领导人首先要相信群众。既要理直气壮地讲成绩，更要毫不掩饰地讲问题。要增强人民的信心，必须先取信于民。”
