A spokesman for Japan Airlines revealed on March 2 that one of the company's large jetliners, a Boeing 747, was forced to make an emergency landing due to two mice on board.

The crew of the plane, which flies between Tokyo and New York, discovered on the night of March 1 after returning from New York to Tokyo that 25 mice (imported from the United States for experimental purposes) had escaped from their cage. They managed to catch 23 of them. However, the remaining two mice were not found by midday on March 2, and at that time, the Boeing 747 was en route from Tokyo to New York. For safety reasons, Japan Airlines ordered the plane to make an emergency landing and stop flying. The 294 passengers were transferred to another aircraft to continue their journey to their destination. Japan Airlines officials stated that the plane would only resume its flight after the two mice were found. Now, traps have been placed on board the plane.

　　老鼠迫降飞机
    据日本航空公司一位发言人３月２日透露，该公司一架大型喷气式客机——波音７４７因钻进两只老鼠，被迫降落停飞。
    这架往返于东京和纽约之间的客机机组人员于３月１日夜从纽约返回东京后发现，２５只老鼠（从美国进口作试验用）从笼子里跑了出来。他们抓住了２３只。可是另外两只到３月２日中午还未找到，而当时波音７４７客机正从东京飞往纽约。为了安全起见，日航不得不下令该机降落停飞，将２９４名乘客安排到另一架飞机上，飞向目的地。日航当局表示，两只老鼠找到后，这架飞机才继续飞行。现在机上已放置了捕鼠器。　　·元·
