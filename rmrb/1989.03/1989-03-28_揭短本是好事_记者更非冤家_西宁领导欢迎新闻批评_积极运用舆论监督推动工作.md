Xinhua News Agency, Xining, March 27th.

The municipal committee and government of Xining, Qinghai Province, have been continuously enhancing their democratic awareness and learning to use media supervision to drive their work forward.

In the past, after the media exposed many problems in Xining, officials would harbor resentment. However, after the idea that "media criticism exposes wounds and cures diseases, and pressure can be turned into motivation" was established, the city's party and government departments gradually opened their doors, welcoming in what were once seen as adversaries.

Over the past two years, the municipal committee and government have encouraged and supported their affiliated news organizations to publish critical reports. The "Street Corner" special program on Xining Television is watched by leading officials every time it airs, serving as a "link to the masses." The municipal television station alone published 170 critical articles last year, and this year has already published 46. Most of these criticisms have been promptly addressed.

For higher-level news organizations, the Xining municipal committee and government have shifted from previously trying to avoid them to now warmly engaging with them. A few years ago, the city's collective economic policies were not implemented, leading to a continuous decline. *Qinghai Daily* published six articles in a row, which had a significant impact on the municipal government. The mayors sat down to revise the urban collective enterprise policies, proposing the principle of "enterprises run themselves, profits and losses are their own, managers are chosen by themselves, workers are recruited by themselves, and wages are set by themselves."

Last year, this sector of the economy grew by 10.24% compared to 1987. The municipal government leaders have visited *Qinghai Daily* and other news organizations multiple times to express their gratitude for the criticisms raised.

At the beginning of the Year of the Snake, *People's Daily* published three articles criticizing the city's problems. With the support of the provincial party committee and government, the city actively carried out rectification and regulation. After the article "Nearly 10,000 'Birth Control Guerrillas' Enter Xining" was published on February 19, the municipal government and family planning departments worked together to handle the issue, reaffirming the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Floating Population Family Planning in Xining City," establishing contracts at the municipal and district/county levels as a hard indicator for assessment; each district/county cooperates to clean up once every quarter.

　　揭短本是好事　记者更非冤家        
    西宁领导欢迎新闻批评   
    积极运用舆论监督推动工作
    本报西宁３月２７日电  记者郅振璞报道：青海省西宁市委市政府不断增强民主意识，学会运用舆论监督推动工作。
    过去，西宁市不少问题被新闻媒介“曝光”后，干部怨气重重。“新闻批评“揭了疮疤医了病，压力可以变动力”的观念确立后，该市党、政部门逐步开启门庭，把“冤家”迎进来。
    两年来，市委、市政府鼓励、支持所属新闻单位的批评报道。西宁电视台办的《街头巷尾》专题，领导干部每播必看，当作“联系群众的纽带”。仅市电视台去年就发批评稿１７０条，今年已达４６条。这些批评绝大部分都得到及时处理。
    对上级新闻单位，西宁市委、市政府也由昔日尽量回避变为热诚相交。前几年，市里集体经济政策不落实，出现连续滑坡现象。《青海日报》连续载文６篇，对市政府震动很大。市长们坐下来修订城镇集体企业政策，提出“企业自己办、盈亏自己负、厂长自己选、工人自己招、工资自己定”的方针。
    去年此块经济比１９８７年增长１０．２４％。市政府领导成员多次去《青海日报》等新闻单位，感谢他们提出的批评。
    蛇年之初，《人民日报》三次载文批评该市的问题。市里在省委、省政府支持下，积极开展治理、整顿。２月１９日《近万对“超生游击队”流入西宁》见报后，市政府和计划生育等部门协同处理，重申《西宁市流动人口计划生育管理暂行办法》，建立市和区、县两级政府承包合同，作为一项硬性考核标准；各区、县配合，每季清理一次。
