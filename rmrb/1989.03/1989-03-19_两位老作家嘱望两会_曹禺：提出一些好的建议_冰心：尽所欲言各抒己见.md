Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 18th.

Two prominent figures in the literary world, Cao Yu and Bing Xin, expressed their hopes for the upcoming Two Sessions in conversations with reporters from this news agency today. They also expressed their confidence in the prosperity and development of socialist literary and artistic endeavors in China.

Cao Yu, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the chairman of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, has been unwell recently and is currently in Beijing Hospital. However, his thoughts are with the Two Sessions. He said, "Since the reform and opening up, we have achieved significant progress, but there are also many problems. This year's Two Sessions are very important. I hope that the delegates and friends attending the sessions will seriously summarize their experiences and lessons, and put forward some good suggestions. I believe the sessions will be a great success. With everyone working together, we can fulfill the duties and responsibilities entrusted to us by the people, and do a better job of managing the country's affairs, gradually leading the nation towards prosperity and strength."

Bing Xin, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the vice-chairman of the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, received reporters from this news agency at her home. She said, "I have high expectations for the Two Sessions. I hope that the representatives and committee members will speak freely and express their own views."

When discussing the opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on promoting the arts, Bing Xin said, "These opinions have been discussed by people in the literary and artistic circles and are very comprehensive. I am very satisfied and hope that these opinions will be implemented. Bing Xin said, "Now we have creative freedom, and literary and artistic workers should also have a strong sense of social responsibility. Some writers use creative freedom as an excuse to write unhealthy things, and this should also be restricted."

　　两位老作家嘱望两会
    曹禺：提出一些好的建议
    冰心：尽所欲言各抒己见
    据新华社北京３月１８日电  文艺界知名人士曹禺、冰心今天在同本社记者谈话时，对即将召开的两会寄予厚望，并对我国社会主义文艺事业的繁荣发展充满了信心。
    全国政协常委、中国文联主席曹禺近来身体欠佳，身在北京医院，心里却在惦念着两会。他说，改革开放以来，我们已经取得了很大成就，但也存在不少问题。今年的两会非常重要，我希望两会的同志们、朋友们认真总结经验教训，提出一些好的建议。我相信会议会开得很好。众志成城，把劲儿合在一起，就能将人民赋予我们的义务、责任履行得好一些，就能把我国的事情办得好一些，使国家逐步走上繁荣昌盛、民富国强的道路。
    全国政协常委、中国文联副主席冰心在她家里接待了本社记者。她说，我对两会期望很大。她希望两会的代表委员们要尽所欲言，各抒己见。
    在谈到中共中央关于繁荣文艺的若干意见时，冰心说，这个意见是经过文艺界人士讨论的，很完善，我很满意，希望这些意见都能落实。冰心说，现在创作自由已经有了，广大文学艺术家也应该有较强的社会责任感。现在有的作家借口创作自由，写一些不健康的东西，对此也应加以限制。
