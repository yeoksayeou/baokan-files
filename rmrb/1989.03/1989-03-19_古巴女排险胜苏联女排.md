Xinhua News Agency, Havana, March 16th.

The Cuban women's national volleyball team fought hard in a five-set battle on the 15th, defeating the Olympic champion Soviet team 3-2.

The Soviet women's team is very strong. In this match, they won the first two sets 15-11 and 15-5, appearing very confident. On the 13th, in their first match during their visit to Cuba, the Soviet team had defeated the Cuban team 3-1.

At a critical moment in the third set when the score was tied at 7-7, the Soviet team substituted their main attacker, Simirnova. The Cuban team seized the opportunity to launch a counterattack, winning the set 15-9.

The fourth set was even more fiercely contested. The Cuban team's defense improved significantly, and they won the set 15-12.

In the decisive fifth set, the new international volleyball federation rule was applied, where a team does not need to secure the serve to score, and any mistake by the opponent results in a point, thus speeding up the game's pace. In the final moments, Cuban rookie left-handed main attacker Rey Bel scored three consecutive powerful spikes, securing a 15-13 victory in the fifth set.

　　古巴女排险胜苏联女排
    新华社哈瓦那三月十六日电  古巴国家女子排球队十五日晚在这里经过五局苦战，以三比二力克奥运会冠军苏联队。
    苏联女排实力雄厚，在这场比赛中先以十五比十一，十五比五连胜两局，看来信心十足。十三日，在访古首场比赛中苏队曾以三比一战胜古巴队。
    在第三局双方打成七平的关键时刻，苏联队把主攻手西米尔诺娃换下场；古巴队趁机大举反攻，以十五比九拿下这关键的一局。
    第四局两队争夺得更为激烈，古巴队的防守大有改观，结果以十五比十二再下一局。
    决定胜负的第五局采用国际排联的新规则，不需取得发球权，只要使对方失误均可得分，因而加速了比赛的进程。古巴队新秀左手主攻手雷·贝尔在最后时刻以三次凶狠的扣杀得分，从而以十五比十三取得了第五局比赛的胜利。
