When people realize that they have become the most valuable social productive force and make the best choice, their power is amplified by 100 times.—Engels

Prologue

In my childhood, a neighbor had a vacuum tube radio. Whenever it played music, I would imagine that inside it were little people from "Lilliput" singing and dancing joyfully. Once, I couldn't resist the urge to open the wooden box to see the inside world and talk to those wonderful little people. This sudden whim led me to climb onto a table using a stool, and in the process, I accidentally knocked the wooden box to the ground. The consequences were predictable. Many years later, on a deep autumn day in 1988, when I stood on the brown soil of the hometown of the New Fourth Army—Suibei City in Jiangsu—looking at the 11-story yellow building of the Suibei Wireless Factory, I suddenly had a childlike thought: Isn't this the famous "Yanwu" with a high reputation? Inside this large "box" made of steel and concrete, are there countless little people singing and dancing?

I entered the factory at 4:40 PM. I saw the giant hour and minute hands of the electronic clock on the factory tower forming a large "人" character under the gray sky.

The Scholar Leaves Home

In those days, scholars did not go out.

In those days, many scholars were "nested" here. Graduates from "Beida," "Qinghua," "Jiaoda," "Fudan," and the Chengdu Institute of Telecommunications... these elite graduates from prestigious universities were exiled to this "Great Northern Wilderness" of Jiangsu due to "background issues," "historical issues," "political issues," "line issues," and "white expert road issues."

In those days, not only did scholars not go out, but even a respectable wireless factory could not afford a grand gate. Like a makeshift stage for a performance, a small building stood in the reeds, somewhat resembling "Sha Jian Hao." About 100 people were cramped here, eating "imperial rations," and producing 10-watt expansion machines that were once popular. After the Cultural Revolution ended, the expansion machines were no longer in demand, so they started producing "Weixing" brand radios.

On this day, the "Scholar Wu" with high-degree glasses was about to leave home, and his wife was packing his belongings.

"Scholar Wu" was named Wu Zhongshi, a graduate of Nanjing Institute of Technology in 1969. His father was a district magistrate in the liberated area who sacrificed himself while covering the retreat of the New Fourth Army. When his father was alive, he once played chess with his subordinate, Secretary Chen. Just then, Secretary Chen's wife came to the district with their newborn daughter, Lan Ying. Wu, the district magistrate, looked at the baby in the cradle and suddenly had a whim: "When she grows up, let her marry my son, Zhongshi." Unexpectedly, one sentence decided the fate of the two children.

At this moment, Chen Lan Ying was packing her husband's belongings while asking, "Why did the factory send you, a 'scholar,' on this trip?"

It was no wonder the wife asked. Usually, political workers and politically reliable workers with clean backgrounds were sent on trips. The purpose of these trips was mostly "external investigations." The objects of investigation were almost always "stinking ninth category" intellectuals. Those who returned from external investigations always brought back thick materials, bringing mystery and excitement. Wasn't that "South Engineer" classmate defined as a "May 16th" element and locked in a cow shed? He was forced to swallow a large iron nail to sever his connection with this world...

Wu Zhongshi told his wife that he was going to Wuxi with Director Wang (the factory director) for a cassette recorder production meeting. Cassette recorders, do you understand?

The wife understood. Her husband had just taken on a very, very important position—the first deputy leader of the Jiangsu Province Suibei County Wireless Factory Cassette Recorder Trial Production Team. Although she did not understand the principles of cassette recorders, she knew that whether the cassette recorder could be successfully produced was a matter of life and death for the entire factory of over 100 people—state and factory had cut off the "milk supply," and the radios produced by the factory were piling up in the warehouse. People were sent to push them on carts to the market, like selling radishes and green vegetables. Over 100 pairs of eyes were eagerly waiting for the cassette recorder production line! The "stinking ninth category" intellectuals had obtained a sample machine from foreign aid doctors and surprisingly produced it by copying the design. This time, Director Wang took Wu Zhongshi to the meeting to fight for the machine core quota.

Wu Zhongshi was unlucky. After entering the Wuxi Fishery Bureau Guesthouse, the registration desk gave them a room near the toilet. Wu Zhongshi immediately felt a sense of "racial discrimination"—just because their factory was small? Just because their factory was poor?

The conference announced the allocation of machine cores: large factories 1000, small factories 500, but there was no share for "Suibei." Not giving the machine cores was equivalent to not giving "Suibei" the opportunity to revive! It was equivalent to smashing "Suibei's" livelihood! Director Wang was a worker-peasant cadre and was quite authoritative in the factory, but here his words became stammering, pushing Wu Zhongshi forward: "You understand the technology, you go and talk."

Wu Zhongshi, with a stiff upper lip, went to find the conference host, Provincial Industrial Bureau Director Feng: "Why didn't you allocate a quota to us?" Director Feng remained silent but publicly mocked him at the conference: "I went to see your factory, it's not even as good as a commune-run enterprise in southern Jiangsu, you can't produce cassette recorders!"

Wu Zhongshi sat there like a pin cushion, almost wanting to leave in anger like a foreign reporter, but he was held back by a sense of responsibility. He couldn't leave, and neither could "Suibei." The specter of "competition" appearing on Chinese soil had already pushed them to a "do-or-die" situation. After the conference, he blocked Director Feng in the rest room: "You haven't let us try, how do you know we can't do it?" Director Feng's tone softened as he said to him: "There's no need to try, other factories produce cassette recorders, and you produce radios, isn't that fine?"

"Radio markets have shrunk, if we don't change, we have no future. Besides, we have strong technical strength." "Well..."

During mealtime, Wu Zhongshi took his bowl to Director Feng's side, facing his expressionless face, saying: "Give us a way out, even if it's one or two, it's fine!" "Okay, I'll go back to the province and see!"

Wu Zhongshi went back to the room and thought about it, feeling something was wrong. Many officials would say such things—"see," "study," "discuss"—but they didn't do anything practical. Wu Zhongshi suddenly got up from the bed and went to the courtyard to catch up with Director Feng: "Director, the plan quota has been allocated, what can you do back in the province?"

Director Feng turned his face: "You're really persistent!"

Usually shy Wu Zhongshi was forced to the wall: "Director Li said we should produce cassette recorders when he inspected our factory. If you, Director Feng, don't agree, we'll stop. In the future, if we see Director Li at the ministry, we won't mention this matter!"

Director Feng's eyes rolled a few times, saying: "Okay, I'll allocate two from other factories, 60 yuan each, go to Shanghai to pick up the goods."

Wu Zhongshi took Director Feng's note—took an opportunity—and rushed straight to Shanghai. Coincidentally, the person in charge of the plan at the pickup point was his university classmate, Chen Kaiming. The old classmate threw Director Feng's note aside: "I'm in charge here. I'll give you two boxes, 1000 units, is that enough?" Wu Zhongshi opened his wide near-sighted eyes, unable to tell if it was joy or resentment...

The Boy Scouts March North

Today, when you see Sun Jianwei—the deputy manager of the "Yanwu" sales and service department—dressed in a suit and tie, with a refined and courteous demeanor, it's hard to imagine his past appearance of winking and slouching.

Sun Jianwei had served as a medic in the army and wanted to return to his old profession after coming back to the factory. However, the factory was small, and the "medical room" had one factory doctor who could apply iodine and dispense cold medicine, which was enough. He was assigned to the electroplating workshop as a worker. The workshop was full of demobilized soldiers, all around 20 years old and single. The girls didn't want to marry "Suibei" people, so these soldiers in faded military uniforms would sing sadly in the workshop: "No tears, no sorrow..." and changed the solemn "Three Main Rules and Eight Points for Attention" to: "Revolutionary soldiers all need wives, please ask the leadership to give one to each of us..." The workshop director was an old sister, who scolded them for not behaving well. They would then perform the "duet" style they learned in the platoon, waving their arms and stomping their feet, singing to her, making the strong and kind old sister cry: "Why are you all like children who never grow up?"

Therefore, the factory leaders often used such language in meetings: "Sun Jianwei and his ilk," "Wu Chun Guang and his ilk" (now the head of the sales department), "Zhu Bing and his ilk" (now also successful)... as if the factory's problems were all caused by their mischief.

At that time, the factory's products were seriously backlogged, and the leaders had a sudden whim: since these people could shout and sing, let them sell the products, so they wouldn't be a nuisance in the workshop! These young men, who were used to the "military communism" life, didn't know what the market was. They cried and sang their way out of the factory, carrying a belly full of resentment to "peddle" on the streets, unexpectedly becoming the first generation of "Yanwu" salesmen! Later, on the stage of China's audio war, they became a formidable ace team in the industry. However, at that time, they had not yet discovered their own genius.

The factory was small, and the factory director's voice could reach the end. One day, the new factory director, Wang Deshao, called Sun Jianwei and Zhu Bing to his office, took out a "twenty-shot" and gave each of them one: "You two go to Beijing and bring our 'Yanwu' cassette recorder into the capital!"

Going to Beijing was no joke. Recently, they had traveled to the Northwest, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Kunming, opening up sales channels for "Yanwu" cassette recorders. However, it was not easy to conquer the Beijing market. The major cassette recorder manufacturers in the country were competing in the capital market, and there were countless foreign brands. Moreover, the two "boy scouts" had only seen Beijing in movies, with no relatives or friends there, and not even a "back door" to knock on...

Director Wang told the two descendants of the New Fourth Army: "Don't say much. Cross the Yangtze River and march into Beijing. This is of great significance to our factory's 'fixed point,' understand?"

This Wang Deshao was not like the previous leaders who were easy to fool. He was a "ninth category" and was not a party member when he took office. However, he had a lot of knowledge to rely on. After taking office, he made a major decision related to the survival and development of "Suibei" Factory—changing to produce cassette recorders, completely reversing the factory's misfortune, and making the workers who went out to sell dog meat return to the factory. Since he decided to "attack Beijing," this decision must be of great importance!

The two descendants of the New Fourth Army each carried a four-speaker "Yanwu" cassette recorder, with the air of their parents carrying Maxim machine guns or mortars in the Battle of Huangqiao.

From Suibei, they took an eight-hour bus ride, then took a train from Nanjing to Beijing. With no seats, they sat at the door, hugging the cassette recorder and dreaming.

The dream was shattered! They encountered a setback in their first round of negotiations in Beijing. A business clerk from a certain department store, smoking a foreign cigarette, sized them up: "Suibei? Never heard of it, where is it?"

"In Jiangsu."

"I've been to Jiangsu, but I've never heard of it."

Sun Jianwei took out a map and spread it in front of the other person, proudly saying: "In northern Jiangsu. This is an old revolutionary base. Yan'an in northern Shaanxi, Suibei in northern Jiangsu. Our factory is near the New Fourth Army headquarters."

"An old revolutionary base is now so poor, can that place produce cassette recorders?"

"We have many intellectuals in our factory, all from prestigious universities. Look at the product quality."

"You are really in trouble, we will help you sell some, as a support for the old revolutionary base. However, we can't sign a contract."

The two young men from northern Jiangsu felt humiliated for the designers in the design room. They had worked day and night with yellow and thin faces and bloodshot eyes! Liu Hongsheng, Huang Jinxin, Tie Buquan, Chen Xinmin, Tu Wenjun... and the elder sister, Deng Guirong, who was seriously ill but let her husband push her to work on a bicycle! The "Yanwu" cassette recorder was completely assembled with their blood and sweat! Could it be so despised? They carried the cassette recorder and resolutely walked out of the department store.

In the vast sea of people, where to go? They remembered Director Wang's instructions: "Try at Wangfujing." The two people walked and asked their way, finding the place called "Wangfujing," and rushed into a department store.

Who would have thought that the business clerk there was even more arrogant: "We can't even sell foreign brand machines here, you'd better not waste your breath."

Sun Jianwei and Zhu Bing hadn't had breakfast but had been rejected twice. Should they carry the machine back? In a dilemma, Sun Jianwei pointed to an arched door across the street: "There's a store."

"That seems to be a free market." Zhu Bing said.

They walked in, and it was very large inside, with a full range of goods. They found the home appliance counter and went all out: "We'll put the cassette recorder here. If we can sell it within an hour, we'll do business; if not, we'll smash it in public and listen to the sound!"

"We don't know you, you're not a famous brand."

"Famous brands are also made famous in the market. How can you become famous without meeting users?"

At that time, the two young men must have been extraordinary, and the counter manager took the "Yanwu" cassette recorder: "Let's try."

Sun Jianwei and Zhu Bing went to a small store outside to eat a sandwich, then returned to the "home appliance department" with anxious hearts. Their feelings were like those of a condemned man approaching the execution ground: wouldn't they really smash the machine?

Suddenly, they were attracted by a moving piece of foreign music. Zhu Bing, who had been in the propaganda team, knew it was Beethoven's "Eroica Symphony" as soon as he heard it. This music came from the "home appliance department," and many customers gathered around the counter, appreciating this world-famous piece dedicated to Napoleon.

No, it belongs to "Suibei"! The magnificent music was flowing from the black body of the "Yanwu" cassette recorder, freely roaming in this competitive world of goods! This was the "Eroica Symphony" jointly performed by over 200 "Suibei" people with their vigilance, passion, and struggle! Because it was beautiful and inexpensive, several customers competed to buy the machine on the spot.

A new history was approaching the "Suibei" people!

The young business clerk, Zhao Shiming, had keen eyes and immediately signed a contract with them for 300 units.

At that time, they only knew that this large store, which looked like a free market, was actually the famous "Dongfeng Market" known worldwide.

Wang Deshao, who was in charge at home, slammed the table and rushed to Beijing, watching Dongfeng Market sell over 200 units in two days. On the third day, he saw a long queue at the gate of Dongfeng Market and asked: "What are you queuing for?" The people in the queue replied: "Buying 'Yanwu' cassette recorders."

Wang Deshao, with tears in his eyes, made a long-distance call to the "ninth category" designers in the design room: "Beijing has recognized us! Thank you!"

Of course, the two "boy scouts" should also be thanked. He made an exception and allowed them to fly back to the "base."

General Zhu's Appointment

When Wang Deshao first took office, "Suibei" still owed over 100 million yuan in debt. In three years, he took three big steps, and by 1984, the output value rose to 21 million yuan!

With a body full of merits, Wang Deshao went to the city to take office as a deputy mayor. People from top to bottom began to worry: who could take over such a large business? The relevant departments flipped through the files over and over again, and finally picked a "general" from among several deputy factory directors—Zhu Chengxue.

Someone said: "He is stable. He can endure hardship and responsibility." This conclusion contained the meaning that it would be good enough if he could guard the situation.

Zhu Chengxue took office, and his tall figure of over 1.8 meters stood in front of all the factory workers, suddenly throwing out an "atomic bomb": In 1985, achieve an output value of 100 million yuan, and tax revenue exceeding 15 million yuan!

People were shocked, stunned, and dumbfounded. Was he having a sudden whim?

People knew him too well. This graduate from "South Engineering" was nicknamed "Zhu Daiban." Since 1969, when he entered the factory, he had silently guarded his technical post, regardless of wind or rain, always completing his share of work beautifully. In 1978, during the "darkness before dawn" in the factory, Liu Hongsheng led some people to attack the cassette recorder. The factory couldn't open the pot, and it was all thanks to Zhu Chengxue working on the "740" military product, earning some grain to fill their stomachs. He worked 30 night shifts a month but only ate meat three times—a large family, life was tight. Later, he got stomach bleeding and was hospitalized for an IV drip, barely pulling through.

However, the doctor could not treat his heart disease. He was the type who would hold grudges. In those years, he couldn't stand the restrictive system—"unified leadership," outsiders running the factory, saying black was black and white was white, not even being able to tell the difference between the front and back of a blueprint, but having the power to sign and approve. If it was wrong, it was scrapped, and saying "paying tuition" was enough. Whoever objected to a word would be given a cold face: "What is your attitude towards the party?" The factory was in debt every year, but such officials were promoted.

Maybe Zhu Chengxue turned the "gas" he had been holding in for many years into "one billion" and let it out. Once let out, it was like a dragon, and by the end of 1985, the accountant's computer screen showed a long string of numbers: "102070000."

"Suibei" created a miracle! "Zhu Daiban" became "Zhu Daban"! The next year, the national cassette recorder market was sluggish, but "Suibei" still broke through the billion mark. By 1987, with a sprint, it won 2.5 billion yuan! It ranked first in the industry nationwide.

"Suibei" Factory created a new Zhu Chengxue in three years. When people mentioned him, they always said: "I didn't expect it." In the past, Zhu Chengxue would sweat when he spoke, but now, he spoke fluently, strategized, and calculated, like a true "General Zhu."

General Zhu had many tricks, but he benefited the most from using people.

There are three stories that show his general's demeanor:

He promoted the technician, Cui Huilian, from the cassette recorder workshop to the head of the factory quality inspection station, putting the entire factory's quality control in her hands. General Zhu knew that the quality war was the "Third World War" quietly underway. Japan's post-war economy had rushed to the forefront of the world through quality management, and could "Suibei" fly without quality?

However, the first to object to Cui Huilian's appointment was Zhu Chengxue's over 70-year-old father. "You're having a whim. Don't you remember that she got your party membership taken away?" The old father was talking about when Zhu Chengxue was the main person in charge of the "740" project, and once he had an argument with Cui Huilian over technical details, Zhu Chengxue threw a temper tantrum and smashed a ruler. Cui Huilian went to the political work department and shed a few tears, and Zhu Chengxue's party membership, which had just been put on the agenda, was shelved again. When he became a deputy factory director, he was still an "outsider."

Zhu Chengxue wanted to use a sentence from the Western management expert Drucker: "Effective management has never asked if he can get along with me, but asks what he can do?" But his father was from the green curtain, and didn't understand the management of large-scale industry. He only explained to his father: "I joined the party late due to policy reasons."

Cui Huilian's upright and impartial personality was indeed the iron fence of quality management. She guarded the quality post meticulously, not afraid to offend people. She also ran to the Beijing Railway Station counter to count the "opening rate" and solicit user opinions, feeding the problems back to the workshop and workstation in a timely manner. Later, the factory established a comprehensive inspection workshop, and she took over as the workshop director, establishing the PPCA circular system. What was even more valuable was that she was good at doing people's work, improving the workers' sense of responsibility, starting from the "quality of people," and raising the product opening rate by 20% to 30%, winning reputation for the factory.

General Zhu also appointed a general, that is, the current first deputy factory director, Zhang Ruzhong. Zhang Ruzhong was an "outsider," originally the deputy director of the technical department of a certain recording equipment factory in Shanghai. In 1981, Zhu Chengxue attended the cassette recorder production meeting in Wuxi and shared a room with Zhang Ruzhong. During the conversation, Zhu Chengxue learned that this "cassette recorder expert" had many difficulties in his life that he couldn't solve—his wife was farming in the countryside of Nantong, and his household registration couldn't be transferred to Shanghai. The old and young were separated, and the economic burden was heavy, with a deficit every year. In his position, he should take care of his duties. After becoming the factory director, Zhu Chengxue specially went to Shanghai to visit Zhang Ruzhong. The visit was actually a "poaching" trip. He showed Zhang Ruzhong the attractive "Ten Preferential Treatments for Engineering and Technical Personnel": "Go, give you as big a stage as your ability; give you as big a cushion as your somersaults."

"Suibei's" choice of Zhang Ruzhong prompted Zhang Ruzhong's choice of "Suibei." He wrote a transfer request.

After Zhu Chengxue returned to the factory, he sent the deputy factory director, Liu Hongsheng, as a "special envoy" to Shanghai. At that time, the relevant departments of Shanghai City and Suibei City reached an agreement: Suibei would provide Shanghai with a certain amount of agricultural and sideline products, and Shanghai would send a certain number of technical talents to Suibei (a losing business). Liu Hongsheng, with this "script," spent more than a month breaking through layers of obstacles and took away the deputy director of the technical department of the earliest recording equipment factory in Asia.

Zhang Ruzhong entered the factory and was given a floating wage, solving the household registration and work of his family members. With his worries removed, he worked with the designers to develop the 1540 type and 1541 type cassette recorders, winning the second and third prizes nationwide that year. The next year, "Yanwu" was listed on the gold list, winning the first prize nationwide.

Zhang Ruzhong's hometown factory saw the later "Yanwu" becoming their strongest competitor and couldn't help but sigh: a moment's hesitation let General Zhu gain a big advantage!

If you talk about high moral character, it's Liu Hongsheng. He invited Zhang Ruzhong, who later became his "superior," and still worked hard to help him. Someone said: "You lost out." He calmly said: "Who has talent, give them the way. If talent can't go to 'Suibei,' 'Suibei' will lose out."

General Zhu also appointed a Wu Peifu. This person, who shares the same name as a warlord from the early 20th century in China, is a graduate of the Chengdu Institute of Telecommunications in 1969. He was transferred out of the factory just as it was about to show signs of life, going to teach at a textile school in the city. "Suibei" took off, and people from all over society looked at it with admiration. But who had more feelings for it than Wu Peifu? Every time he turned on the TV and saw that advertising star with headphones singing the "Yanwu" song, his heart would be torn and tangled. He intentionally or unintentionally collected all the information about the factory. His old comrades were working hard, and had already developed over 60 new types of cassette recorders. That powerful and strong sales iron army, invincible, pushed the products to all corners of the country. Recently, the factory signed a contract with a Greek tycoon, and 10,000 "Yanwu" cassette recorders would be sent to the hometown of the wise man Aristotle. When he left, the factory didn't even have a bathroom, and workers had to go to the textile factory to bathe, and the gatekeeper would glare at them, making the sweaty workers turn back dejectedly; when he left, the factory didn't have a guesthouse, and guests stayed at the technical school, and sent guests using bicycles to carry luggage, really embarrassing; when he left, the factory didn't have a dining hall, and workers ate their meals on the way... Today, his old comrades all lived in three-bedroom or two-bedroom apartments, wallpapered, carpeted, almost floating a grade every year. That Tie Buquan got a difficult disease, and the factory sent a Toyota to Shanghai for treatment. When did the "ninth category" receive such treatment? Wu Peifu wanted to go back to the factory to see, but he was also afraid to go back to the factory. His wife said: "We left during the difficult times, now going back, how will people look at us!" A tall and open Wu Peifu became sullen and wilted.

One day, the school sent Wu Peifu to find Zhu Chengxue—to ask "Suibei" to support the establishment of a small workshop. What "support"? It was clearly begging for alms! Wu Peifu stiffened his neck and stepped into Zhu Chengxue's home. He sat in front of Zhu Chengxue, hunched over, red-faced, and stammered as he spoke. Zhu Chengxue warmly offered him a cigarette and poured him water, but his heart ached: history had twisted so many people's hearts! He softly called out: "Old Wu, come back. The factory needs you, you can come back anytime. In the past, the factory treated intellectuals as 'insects,' coming and going without much importance. Today, intellectuals are 'dragons.' Last year, our factory's per capita output value was 100,000 yuan, the first in the country, creating so much value with what? With intelligence development, with talent! In the 'Eighth Five-Year Plan,' our annual output value will be 2 billion yuan, can it be done without people?"

Wu Peifu returned to the factory and took over as the director of the third workshop—the original workshop director was a model worker, working diligently, but due to management not keeping up with the factory's development speed, the product qualification rate was low, and the monthly output was less than 70,000 units. Zhu Chengxue let Wu Peifu fight a comeback battle.

Wu Peifu first won a "comeback battle" in living conditions, getting a three-bedroom apartment, and his monthly salary jumped to 450 yuan. Wu Peifu couldn't wait to offer his brain to "Yanwu"!

In fact, General Zhu didn't do business at a loss. He paid Wu Peifu 450 yuan a month, but Wu Peifu created a glorious record of 120,000 units a month for him, which was thousands of times what he paid Wu Peifu!

The Talented Woman Recognizes Talent

She is named Feng Yaping, the youngest female workshop director in the factory, a talented woman. I read a small poem she wrote in the factory newspaper...

When she first took office, the workshop director let her choose three team leaders herself. She thought for a moment and said the first name was "Li Jiangbo."

The workshop director said: "She argued with you before, didn't she?"

The talented woman said: "You asked who can take on the team leader position, not who argued with me."

"You can't handle her, can you?"

"I use her strengths."

"She is a 'always right,' and her mouth is sharp."

"Can a team leader who can't argue with workers work? A circuit board has 70-80 processes, how can you keep the quality with a good person?"

I was moved by this story. She was not the head of the personnel department or the organization department, but she was so good at using people. How did she, at such a young age, understand how to respect and understand people so well?

However, she didn't think much of it, speaking softly to me: "Now, using people still relies on 'Berlese,' and can't use a complete talent system to guarantee that talents can come out. A horse locked in a stable, how do you know if it's a thousand-mile horse? Not all horses have the chance to show their speed..."

From her words, from many stories of "Yanwu," I suddenly thought of the idiom left by our ancestors: picking a general from a group of short people. Perhaps this proverb itself contains a prejudice against talents—seeing the selected person as a "short person."

Marx said: People will revolve around their own sun.

Abandon all distortions, damages, misunderstandings, jealousies, numbness, and indifference towards people, and let people return to their rightful positions. Perhaps every "short person" is a general who has been placed in the wrong position.

I had another sudden whim!

　　忽发奇想〔报告文学〕
    李延国
    当人们意识到自己已成为最宝贵的社会生产力进行最佳选择时，这些人的力量就强加了１００倍。——恩格斯
    引子
    童年，邻居家有一台电子管收音机，每当它播放音乐时，我总幻想那里面关着一些“小人国”里的公民，他（她）们在木壳子里面尽情地唱歌、跳舞，美妙无比。有一次我竟忍不住要扳开木壳子看看里面的世界，与那些奇妙的小人儿进行对话。这忽发的奇想诱使我借板凳爬上桌面，一不小心，将木匣子整个儿翻在了地上，其后果是可想而知的。若干年后，也就是１９８８年深秋的一天，当我站在新四军的故乡——苏北盐城的褐色土地上时，我远远望着盐城无线电总厂那米黄色的１１层大楼，竟然又萌发了童心：这不就是那个“知名度”颇高的“燕舞”吗？在这座钢筋水泥构筑的大“盒子”里，也有无数的“小人儿”在唱歌跳舞吗？
    我进厂的时间是下午４点４０分，我看到工厂钟楼上电子钟那巨大的时针和分针在灰色的天空下搭成了一个大大的“人”字。
    伍秀才出门
    那时节，这里的秀才不出门。
    那时节，这里“窝”着好多秀才。“北大”的、“清华”的、“交大”的、“复旦”的、成都电讯工程学院的……这些名牌学府的高材生都因“出身问题”、“历史问题”、“政治问题”、“路线问题”、“白专道路问题”被流放到这江苏的“北大荒”。
    那时节，莫说秀才不出门，一个堂堂的无线电厂竟穷得撑不起一座大门。就像唱戏搭野台子，一座不起眼的小楼坐落在芦苇荡里，有些像“沙家浜”。１００多人窘在这里，吃着“皇粮”，生产着大喊大叫用的十瓦收扩机。“文革”结束，收扩机不再热门，又生产“卫星”牌收音机。
    这天，戴着高度近视镜的“伍秀才”要出门去了，结发妻为他打点行装。
    “伍秀才”名叫伍忠实，南京工学院６９届毕业生，父亲当年是解放区的一个区长，掩护新四军撤退时牺牲。父亲在世时有一次和手下的陈秘书下棋，适逢陈秘书的妻子抱着出生不久的女儿兰英来区上，伍区长望着襁褓中的女婴忽发奇想：“长大了嫁给我家忠实。”不想一句话竟定了两个孩子的终身。
    此时，陈兰英一边为丈夫打点行装，一边问：“厂里那么多人，怎么派上了你这个‘秀才’呢？”
    难怪妻子发问，往日出差大都派政工干部和出身清白政治上表现好的工人骨干。出差的目的大都是“外调”。审查的对象差不多都是“臭老九”。外调的人回来，总带回厚厚的材料，带回神秘和骚动。那位“南工”的同学不就是这样被定为“５．１６”分子关进牛棚的吗？逼得他生生吞下一只大铁钉子，以便切断同这个世界的联系……
    伍秀才告诉妻子，他是跟王主任（厂长）去无锡开收录机生产会议的，收录机，懂吗？
    妻懂。丈夫刚刚担任了一个非常非常重要的职务——江苏省盐城县无线电厂收录机试制小组第一副组长。她虽然不懂收录机的原理，却知道收录机能否试制成功是关系到全厂百多号人生死存亡的大问题——国家和工厂断了“奶亲”，厂里生产的收音机一批批积压在库里，派人装上板车去赶集，就像卖萝卜青菜。百多双眼睛都在盼望上收录机生产线哪！“臭老九”们从援外医生那里弄来一台样机，竟然照着葫芦画瓢地鼓捣成了。这次王主任带上伍秀才去开会，是去争取机芯指标的。
    伍秀才运气不佳。进了无锡市水产局招待所，会议报到处把靠厕所的房间分给了他和王主任。伍秀才顿时感到一种“种族歧视”，不就看俺厂子小吗？不就看俺厂子穷吗？
    大会宣布分配机芯，大厂１０００，小厂５００，唯独没有“盐无”的份。不给机芯，就等于不给“盐无”振兴的机会！就等于砸“盐无”的饭碗！王主主是工农干部，在厂里还挺威风，在这里说话变得支支吾吾，把伍秀才往前面推：“你懂行，你去说。”
    伍秀才硬着头皮去找主持会的省工业局冯局长：“为什么不分给我们指标？”冯局长不吭声，在大会上却指名道姓挖苦：“我去看了你们厂，连苏南的社办企业都不如，你们是搞不出收录机来的！”
    伍秀才在下面如坐针毡，差一点要像外国记者那样“愤然退席”，可是，他被一种责任定在那里，他退不得，他们“盐无”也退不得，中国大地上出现的“竞争”这个幽灵，已经把他们逼到了“背水一战”的地步。会后他到休息室堵住了冯局长：“还没叫我们干，怎么知道我们不行？”冯局长口气缓和地对他说：“用不着试了，别的厂生产收录机，你们生产收音机，不是正好吗？”“收音机市场已经萎缩了，不改我们就没有出路。何况我们有雄厚的技术力量。”“这个……”
    吃饭时，伍秀才又端了饭碗凑到冯局长身边，对着他那没有表情的面孔说：“给我们一条生路吧，哪怕给一支、两支也行！”“这样吧，我回到省里再看看！”
    伍秀才回屋里一品味，觉得不对头，许多当官的都会这腔调儿——“看看”　、“研究研究”、“再议一议”，其实都不办实事。伍秀才忽地一下儿从床上爬起来，到院子里追上冯局长：“局长，计划指标分配光了，你回省里又有啥法？”
    冯局长侧过脸：“你真能缠！”
    平日说话脸红的伍秀才被逼上梁山：“李部长去我们厂视察时让我们上收录机。你冯局长不同意我们上就作罢，我们日后到部里见到李部长决不提这件事情！”
    冯局长眼睛骨碌了两下，说：“这样吧，我从其它厂匀两个给你们，６０块钱一个，到上海取货。”
    伍秀才揣上冯局长的条子——揣上一个机遇，直奔上海。无巧不成书，在取货点管计划的是他大学的同学陈开明。老同学把冯局长的条子扔到一边：“这里我说了算。给你两箱，１０００支，够了吧？”伍秀才大睁着一对近视眼，说不出是惊喜还是怨恨……
    童子军北上
    你今天看见孙建伟——“燕舞”经营销售服务部副经理西装革履、风度翩翩、彬彬有礼的现代文明人的姿态，很难想象出当年他一副挤眉弄眼吊儿郎当的样子。
    孙建伟在部队干过卫生员，回工厂想干老本行，怎奈厂子小，“卫生室”有一个厂医涂涂紫药水、发发感冒药就足够了，他被分配到电镀车间当工人。车间里一窝子退伍兵，都是２０来岁的小光棍儿，姑娘们不愿嫁给“盐无”人，这些穿着退色军装的光棍们就在班上哭兮兮地唱：“没有眼泪，没有悲伤……”并篡改了庄严的《三大纪律八项注意》——“革命军人个个要老婆，请求领导一人发一个……”车间主任是位老大姐，上前批评他们不学好，他们便拿出在连队演唱：“对口词”的姿式，伸胳膊跺脚，对着干，直气得那位刚强而善良的老大姐抹眼泪：你们怎么都是些长不大的孩子呢？
    因此，厂里领导开大会经常这样措词：“孙建伟之流”，“吴春光之流”（现在是经营部的“一把手”了），“朱兵之流”（现在也出息了）……仿佛工厂搞不好都是由于他们搅和的。
    那阵子厂里产品积压严重，领导忽发奇想：这帮人不是能吵能唱吗？好，让他们推销产品去，免得在车间里碍事！这些过惯了“军事共产主义”生活的小伙子们还不知市场为何物，连哭带唱滚出厂外，揣着一肚子怨气去“沿街叫卖”，不想竟成了“盐无”第一代推销员！后来，在中国音响战争的舞台上，他们又成了同行业中令人望而生畏的一支王牌军。不过，当时他们并没有发现自己所具有的天才。
    厂子小，厂长一嗓子喊到底。那天新任厂长王德超把孙建伟和朱兵叫到办公室，掏出“二十响”，每人丢一支：“你俩到北京走一走，把咱们的‘燕舞’收录机扛进首都！”
    进北京是闹着玩的吗？前阵子走西北，串山东，转浙江，下昆明，给“燕舞”收录机打开了销路，可是要攻占北京市场谈何容易？全国收录机的大厂家竞相在首都市场亮出他们的“王牌”，还有那数不清的洋牌子。何况，两位“童子军”还只是在电影上见过北京城，那里无亲无故，连“后门”都摸不着……
    王厂长对两个新四军的后代说：“不给你们多说。打过长江去，打进北京去，这对我们厂‘定点’有重大意义，懂吗？”
    这个王德超可不像以往那些领导那么好糊弄。他是“老九”，上任时还不是党员。可他有一肚子学问做靠山，上任后作出了关系到“盐无”厂生存发展的一大决策——转产收录机，彻底扭转了厂里的厄运，使那些上街卖狗肉的工人纷纷返回厂里。既然他决定“攻打北京”，那么，这个决策就一定事关重大！
    两个新四军的后代每人扛起一台四喇叭“燕舞”收录机，那架势就像他们的父辈在黄桥决战时扛起马克沁机关枪或迫击炮什么的。
    从盐城坐八个小时公共汽车，然后在南京又搭乘去北京的火车。没有座位，他们就坐在车门口，搂着收录机做美梦。
    美梦破灭了！他们在北京的“第一轮”谈判就碰了钉子。某商场业务科的业务员叼着外烟打量着他们：“盐城？从没听说过，在哪里？”
    “在江苏。”
    “我去过江苏，怎么没听说？”
    孙建伟摸出地图，摊到对方面前自豪地说：“在苏北。这里可是老革命根据地。陕北的延安，苏北的盐城。我们厂就在新四军军部附近。”
    “老革命根据地如今穷得叮当响，那地方能出收录机？”
    “我们厂的知识分子多，都是名牌大学的。不信你看产品质量。”
    “你们实在困难，我们就帮你们代销一部分，算是支援老革命根据地。不过，不能签合同。”
    两个苏北后生为设计所的那些“眼镜”们感到了屈辱。他（她）们是带着黄瘦的面孔、带着眼睛里的血丝俯在设计室里没日没夜地攻关的呵！刘鸿生、黄锦心、帖步宽、陈新民、屠文君……还有那个耿桂英大姐，身患重病，还让丈夫用自行车推着去上班！“燕舞”收录机，完全是用他们的心血和汗水组合起来的！难道就这么不屑一顾？他们扛起收录机，毅然走出这家商场。
    人海茫茫，去哪里呢？他们记起王厂长交待过：“去王府井试试。”两个人边走边打探找到了那个叫“王府井”的地方，闯进了一家百货公司。
    谁想那里的业务员更傲慢：“我们这里连外国的名牌机子都不好销，你们趁早别费口舌。”
    孙建伟和朱兵没吃早餐，却接连吃了闭门羹。难道就这样把机子扛回去？进退维谷之际，孙建伟指着对面一个拱形大门说：“那里有个店。”
    “好像是个自由市场。”朱兵说。
    走进去，里面好大，货品好全。他们找到家电部的柜台，来了个破釜沉舟：“我们把收录机放这里，如一个小时之内能卖掉，就做笔生意；卖不掉，我们当众把机子摔了，一块听个响！”
    “我们对你们不熟悉，你们不是名牌厂家。”
    “名牌厂家也是在市场上较量出来的。不和用户见面，怎么能成了名牌！”
    当时两位年轻人的气度一定不凡，柜台负责人把“燕舞”接过来：“我们试试吧。”
    孙建伟和朱兵到门外的小店吃了一顿面包，然后忐忑不安地返回“家电部”。他们的心情有如走近刑场的死刑犯：该不会真的摔机子吧？！
    猛然，他们被一阵动人的外国音乐吸引住了，干过“宣传队”的朱兵一听就知是贝多芬的《英雄交响曲》。这乐声来自“家电部”，许多顾客围聚在柜台前欣赏着这属于拿破仑的世界名曲。
    不，它属于“盐无”！那酣畅的乐曲正从“燕舞”收录机那黑色的机体中流泻出来，在这个充满了竞争的商品世界自由驰骋！这是２００多“盐无”人用他们的警醒、用他们的激情、用他们的拚搏共同演奏出的“英雄交响曲”！由于它物美价廉，当场有几个顾客争买这台机子。
    新的历史向“盐无”人走来了！
    商场年轻的业务员卓时中独具慧眼，当即和他们签订下３００台的合同。
    这时他们才知道，这个在外观看去像自由市场的大店，原来是闻名中外的“东风市场”。
    在家坐镇的王德超一拍桌子赶往北京，眼瞅着东风市场两天卖出２００多台。第三天一早，他看到东风市场门口排着长长的队，上前询问：“排队买什么？”排队的人回答：“买‘燕舞’牌收录机。”
    王德超眼泪吧嗒地打长途电话给设计所的“老九”们：“北京承认我们了！感谢你们！”
    当然也要感谢两位“童子军”。他破例批准他们乘飞机回“根据地”去。
    朱大帅点将
    王德超刚上任时“盐无”还欠着百多万元的债，他三年迈出三大步，到１９８４年，产值一下升到２１００万！
    带一身汗马功劳，王德超到市里就任副市长去了。上上下下开始忧虑：谁能接下这么大的家业？有关部门把档案翻过来翻过去，最后在几个副厂长里拔了一个“将军”——朱成学。
    有人说：“他稳。能任劳任怨。”这结论中包含着这么一层意思：他把摊子守住就不错了。
    朱成学走马上任，一米八几的大个子往全厂职工面前一站，冷丁甩出了一颗“原子弹”：１９８５年，要实现产值一亿元，利税超过１５００万！
    人们惊了，愣了，傻了，他是忽发奇想吗？
    人们太熟悉他了。这个“南工”的高材生，外号叫“朱大板”，从１９６９年进厂后，就默默守着他的技术岗位，不管风吹雨打，总是把分内那份活儿完成得漂漂亮亮。１９７８年，也就是厂里“黎明前的黑暗”那段岁月，刘鸿生带着一些人去攻收录机，厂里揭不开锅，全靠朱成学在搞着“７４０”军工产品，挣些粮米糊口。他一个月加３０个夜班，却只吃三次肉——家里人口多，生活拮据。后来得了胃出血，住院打吊瓶，好歹挺过来了。
    医生却无法治他的心病。他这种人最会生闷气。那些年他看不惯那种束缚人的体制——“一元化”领导，工厂是外行当家，说是黑就是黑，说是白就是白，连图纸的反正都辨不过来，却有签字批准权。错了废了，说句“缴学费”就算完。谁反驳一句，就板起一副冷面孔：“你对党是什么态度？”工厂年年亏损，这样的干部却往上升。
    也许，朱成学把憋了多年的“气”变成“一个亿”吐出来了。这一吐则气贯长虹，１９８５年底，会计师的计算机屏幕上显出“１０２０７００００”一长串数字。
    “‘盐无’创奇迹了！”“朱大板”变成了“朱大胆”！转年来全国收录机市场萧条，“盐无”仍闯亿元关。到１９８７年一个冲刺，夺得两亿五千万！跃居全国同行业之首。
    “盐无”厂三年塑造了一个崭新的朱成学。人们提起他的时候总说：“没想到。”过去朱成学一讲话头上冒汗，如今，口若悬河，运筹帷幄，神机妙算，俨然一个“朱大帅”。
    朱大帅的绝招很多，但他最得益的还是用人。
    有故事三则，可见其大帅气度：
    他一上任就提拔收录机车间的技术员崔华莲为厂质量监测站站长，把全厂质量关。朱大帅知道质量之战，是正在悄悄进行的“第三次世界大战”。日本战后经济就是借质量管理这条高速公路冲到世界前列的，“盐无”的腾飞不靠质量行吗？
    可是，对崔华莲的任命，首先提出反对的是朱成学的７０多岁的老父亲。“你心血来潮。忘了那年她把你的党员给闹掉了？”老父亲说的是朱成学当“７４０”课题主持人那阵，有一次因技术细节和崔华莲发生争执，朱成学发了倔脾气，摔了板子。崔华莲到政工科去抹了几滴眼泪，刚被提到日程上来的朱成学入党问题又被搁置下了。到他担任副厂长时还是个“党外人士”。　
    朱成学想引用西方管理学家杜拉克的一句话：“有效的管理从来不问他能跟我合得来吗？而问的是他能做些什么？”可父亲是青纱帐里人，不懂得大工业管理的用人之道。他只给父亲解释一句：“我入党晚是政策的原因。”
    崔华莲那刚正无私的个性果然是质量管理的铁栅栏，她一丝不苟地坚守质量岗位，不怕得罪人。她还亲自跑到北京站柜台，统计“开箱率”，征求用户意见，把问题及时反馈回车间、工位。后来厂里成立统检车间，她又担任了车间主任，建立起ＰＰＣＡ循环系统。更为难得的是，她善于做人的工作，提高职工的责任感，从“人的质量”入手，把商品开箱率提高了２０％到３０％，为厂里赢得了信誉。
    朱大帅还点了一员大将，那便是现在的第一副厂长张汝忠。张汝忠是个“外来户”，原来是上海某录音器材厂技术科副科长。１９８１年朱成学在无锡开收录机生产会议，和张汝忠同住一屋。交谈中朱成学得知这位“收录机通”生活上有许多困难无法解决——爱人在南通乡下种田，户口进不了上海，老老少少分隔两地，经济上负担重，年年有“赤字”。在其位，谋其政。朱成学当厂长后，专程去上海看望张汝忠。名为“看望”，实为“挖墙脚”。他向张汝忠亮出了诱人的《工程技术人员十项优厚待遇》：“去吧，你有多大的本事，就给你搭多大的舞台；你能翻多大的跟头，就给你铺多大的垫子。”
    “盐无”对张汝忠的选择，促使了张汝忠对“盐无”的选择。他写了请调报告。
    朱成学回厂后又派副厂长刘鸿生当“特使”前往上海。这时上海市有关部门和盐城地区达成一个协议：盐城给上海提供一定的农副产品，上海向盐城输送一定的技术人才（蚀本生意）。刘鸿生抱着这本“经”蘑菇了一个多月，打通了重重关节，把亚洲最早的一家录音器材厂的技术科副科长挖走了。
    张汝忠进厂后浮动一级工资，解决了家属的户口和工作。解除了后顾之忧，他和设计室的同志们一起奋力攻关，搞出１５４０型和１５４１型收录机，当年夺得全国二等奖和三等奖。转年来，“燕舞”名列金榜之首，夺得全国一等奖的桂冠。
    张汝忠的娘家厂眼见得后来居上的“燕舞”成了他们最强硬的竞争对手，不禁暗叹：一念之差，让朱大帅占了个大便宜！
    要讲高风格还数刘鸿生。他请来的张汝忠后来当了他的“上司”，他还卖命地搭帮手。有人说：“你亏了。”他平静地说：“谁有才能就给谁让路。人才上不去‘盐无’就亏了。”
    朱大帅还点了个吴佩孚。这个与中国本世纪初那个军阀重名的人是成都电讯工程学院的１９６９届毕业生，在工厂即将露出“鱼肚白”的时候调走了，去市纺织学校当教员。“盐无”腾飞了，全社会的人都投来青睐。可是有谁比吴佩孚对它注入更多的情思呢？每当打开电视机看到那个头戴耳机，高唱燕舞之歌的广告明星，心里就扯不断，理还乱。他有意无意地搜集着有关工厂的一切信息。他的老伙伴们发愤图强，已经开发出６０多个收录机新品种。那支庞大而威壮的销售铁军，所向无敌，把产品推向神州的四面八方。前不久，厂里和希腊大亨签订了合同，一万台“燕舞”将运往智者亚里士多德的故乡。他离开的时候厂里还没有浴室，工人洗澡跋涉到纺织厂去，把门的一瞪眼，一身汗迹的职工们便蔫蔫地折回头；他离开的时候厂里没有招待所，来了客人住技校，送客人用自行车推行李，真寒碜死人；他离开的时候厂里没有饭厅，职工打了饭在路上吃……今天呢，他那些老伙伴都住上了三室一厅、两室一厅，贴壁纸，铺地毯，几乎一年浮动一级工资。那个帖步宽得了疑难症，厂里派一辆丰田直送到上海诊治。“老九”们何时受过这种礼遇啊？吴佩孚想回厂看看，却又怕进厂。妻说：“困难时咱走了，这阵回去人家会怎么看呀！”一个魁伟、豪放的吴佩孚，变得闷闷不乐，蔫了。
    那天，学校派吴佩孚去找朱成学——请“盐无”支援办个小作坊。什么“支援”？明明是求施舍呀！吴佩孚硬着头皮跨进朱成学的家。他坐在朱成学面前，弓着背，脸涨红，说话也打起结巴来。朱成学热情地递烟倒水，心里却难受极了：历史扭曲了多少人的心！他轻声呼唤：“老吴，回来吧。厂里需要你，什么时候回来都行。过去厂里把知识分子当‘虫’，来去无足轻重。今天知识分子是‘龙’。去年咱们厂人均产值１０万元，全国第一，创这么大的价值靠什么？靠智力开发，靠人才！到‘八五’咱们年产值是２０个亿，没有人能行吗？”
    吴佩孚回厂担任了三车间主任——原来的车间主任是劳模，工作勤勤恳恳，但由于管理跟不上工厂的发展速度，产品质量合格率低，月产量不到７万台。朱成学让吴佩孚来打翻身仗。
    吴佩孚首先在生活待遇上打了个“翻身仗”，分得三室一厅，月工资一下拿到４５０元。吴佩孚巴不得一下子把脑浆全捧给“燕舞”！
    其实，朱大帅不做赔本生意。他每月付给吴佩孚４５０元，而吴佩孚每月为他创出１２万台的辉煌战绩，是他付给吴佩孚的几千倍！
    女才子识才
    她叫冯亚萍，是全厂最年轻的一个女工段长，一位才女。我在厂刊上读到她写的一首小诗……
    她刚上任时，车间主任让她自己挑三个班长，她稍加思索，第一个就说出“李江波”。
    车间主任说：“她不是和你吵过架吗？”
    女才子说：“你不是问我谁能胜任班长吗？并没有问谁和我吵过架。”
    “你弄得过她吗？”
    “我用她的长处。”
    “她可是个‘常有理’，嘴头子厉害。”
    “当班长的吵不过工人能行吗？一块线路板７０多道工序，要把好质量关用老好人行吗？”
    我被这个故事感动了。她不是人事科长不是组织部长，却这样精于用人之道。她小小的年纪，怎么就那么懂得尊重人、理解人呢？
    可是她并不以为然，慢声细语地对我说：“现在用人还是靠‘伯乐’，不能用完善的人才制度来保障人才出山。一匹马关在厩里，怎么知道是千里马呢？并不是所有的马都有机会显示自己脚力的……”
    我从她的话语里，从“燕舞”的许多故事里，猛然联想到祖先留下来的那句成语：矮子里面拔将军。也许，这句古训本身就包含着一种人才偏见——视被选拔者为“矮子”。
    马克思说：人将围绕自己的太阳旋转。
    摈弃一切对人们的扭曲、损害、误解、妒嫉、麻木和漫不经心吧，让人回到应有的位置上来。也许，每一个“矮子”都是放错了位置的将军。
    我又忽发奇想！
