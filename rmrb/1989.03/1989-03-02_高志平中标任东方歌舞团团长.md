    Gao Zhiping Wins Bid to Become Director of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe
    Our reporter Chen Yuan reports: The highly anticipated selection for the director of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe has been announced, with Gao Zhiping taking the position. This decision was made by 13 committee members after a live defense on February 22.

    Gao Zhiping, 48, previously served as the performance director of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe. He graduated from the Shanghai Conservatory of Music in 1964, has been a solo performer, and has created and directed numerous large-scale concerts. He believes that the current difficulties of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe stem from poor management, and thus has formulated a reform plan for the management system. He does not agree that the artistic future of the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe should be limited to Asian, African, and Latin American dances, proposing to expand the scope as much as possible. Gao Zhiping is the only non-Communist Party member among the six candidates.

    This new director is fortunate, as the troupe he will lead possesses the best training and performance facilities in the country. The Oriental Song and Dance Troupe's location in Dongjiao Bridge, Beijing, is a modern building with dozens of practice rooms and music rooms. However, he also faces many challenges. It is said that the Ministry of Culture will gradually reduce its funding, potentially requiring them to be self-sufficient.

    高志平中标任东方歌舞团团长
    本报讯　记者陈原报道：社会瞩目的东方歌舞团团长招聘日前揭晓，高志平出任团长。这是13位评委经2月22日答辩会的现场考验后投票决定的。
    48岁的高志平曾任东方歌舞团音乐会演出队长。他1964年毕业于上海音乐学院，做过独唱演员，创作、编导过多台大型音乐会。他认为东方歌舞团目前不景气的症结在于管理不善，因而制订了一套管理体制的改革方案。他不赞成东方歌舞团的艺术未来只局限于亚非拉歌舞，提出要尽量扩大领域。高志平是6位投标人中唯一的非共产党员。
    这位新任团长很幸运，他掌管的团体拥有全国最好的训练和演出设施。位于北京东郊亮马桥的东方歌舞团所在地是一座新式建筑物，内有几十间练功房和琴房。他也面临许多困难，据说文化部将逐年减少拨款，有可能让他们自负盈亏。
