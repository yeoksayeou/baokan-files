Li Peng and others participated in the NPC group discussions today. Li Peng: Controlling Prices Requires Efforts from All Sides

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 23rd (reporters Wu Shishen, Li Zhiyong) Frankness, open expression, and mutual exchange characterized the lively atmosphere during the discussion of the government work report between the Shanghai delegation and Premier Li Peng this afternoon.

Shanghai representatives spoke openly in front of the Premier, fully affirming that the government work report was realistic and focused on key issues. At the same time, they frankly raised opinions and suggestions.

In his concluding remarks, Premier Li Peng said that the economic rectification and restructuring over the past half-year had achieved initial results, but these should not be overestimated. Economic rectification and restructuring require sacrifices and are a complex and arduous task that cannot be completed in a short period. Li Peng said that the State Council and governments at all levels must fully implement the relevant policies and measures of the central government, work diligently, consult with the masses on matters, listen to the opinions and voices of the masses, and promptly identify and solve problems.

When discussing the price issue, Li Peng pointed out that ensuring that the price increase this year is significantly lower than last year is an important goal for the government's work. He said that controlling prices is the joint responsibility of the central and local governments, enterprises, and commercial departments, and it requires the joint efforts of all sectors of society, as well as effective public supervision.

When discussing how to alleviate the current financial difficulties, Li Peng said that an important aspect is to promote patriotism and encourage savings, which benefits both the country and the people.

Premier Li Peng emphasized that although some emergency administrative measures have been taken during the economic rectification and restructuring, these are for the healthy development of the economy and will not return to the old path of excessive centralization and over-regulation.

Hu Qili: The Scope of Democratic Decision-Making Should Be Expanded

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 23rd (reporters Ou Yang, Wu Shishen) Hu Qili, who once served as the mayor of Tianjin, today participated in the review of the government work report as a NPC delegate. He said that economic rectification and restructuring, as well as deepening reforms, cannot be done in isolation or by treating symptoms rather than causes. It is necessary to expand the scope of democratic decision-making and widely listen to the opinions of people from all walks of life.

Hu Qili said that reform is the business of the entire nation and must uphold the Party's tradition of seeking truth from facts and learning from the masses. It is necessary to increase the openness of the leadership's activities and strive for scientific and democratic decision-making.

Hu Qili said that there are many and complex contradictions in real life, and it is even more necessary to pool wisdom and utilize collective intelligence. He used an analogy, saying that traditional Chinese medicine emphasizes the balance of qi and blood. Now the economy is somewhat imbalanced, so everyone needs to take the pulse and analyze. Some diagnostic opinions may be hard to hear or sharp, but as long as they are truthful, we should seriously listen to them.

Wang Zhen: National Unity Needs to Be Strengthened

According to our reporter Yuan Jiandá, Beijing, March 23rd: Developing the national economy and maintaining national unity were the main themes of the Xinjiang delegation's review of the government work report today. Vice President Wang Zhen and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Saifuddin Azizi participated in the discussion as NPC delegates.

Wang Zhen said in his speech that through rectification and restructuring, Xinjiang should present a new situation and reach a new level, which requires strengthening national unity and maintaining national unity.

Saifuddin Azizi said in his speech that to maintain Xinjiang's development momentum, it is necessary to seriously implement the Party and state's policies on ethnic minorities and further develop a new type of equal, united, and mutually supportive ethnic relations. Decisive measures must be taken to combat actions and speeches that disrupt ethnic unity and progress.

Tian Jiyun: The Time for Agricultural Transformation Has Come

According to our reporter Mo Xinyuan and Xinhua News Agency reporter Cao Shaoping, Beijing, March 23rd: Vice Premier Tian Jiyun visited the Guizhou delegation yesterday afternoon to listen to their opinions on the discussion of three reports and had an in-depth discussion with the representatives on agricultural issues.

Wang Chaowen, a representative from Guizhou Province, mentioned that the grain situation in Guizhou Province is currently quite severe. Guizhou Province has formulated a five-year plan for grain production, and in addition to increasing investment within the province, it hopes that the State Council will provide support in terms of funds.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun said that the agricultural issue is not only a difficulty in Guizhou's economic work but also a difficulty in the national economic work. Now is the time for agricultural transformation. If we do not make a firm decision to tackle this issue, it will be a missed opportunity.

Tian Jiyun also believes that developing Guizhou's agriculture should focus on improving low- and medium-yield fields and increasing yield per unit area. It is important to protect the ecological environment and avoid deforestation for farming.

　　李鹏等参加人大分组讨论
    李鹏：管好物价需上下努力
    据新华社北京３月２３日电　（记者吴士深、李志勇）坦率、畅所欲言、上下交流，这是今天下午上海代表团和李鹏总理一起讨论政府工作报告时出现的生动气氛。
    上海代表在总理面前畅所欲言，充分肯定了政府工作报告实事求是、重点突出，同时也坦率地提出意见和建议。
    李鹏总理最后发言时说，治理整顿半年来，已取得初步成效，但不能估计过高。治理整顿需要付出代价，是一项非常复杂与艰苦的任务，不是短时间内可以完成的。李鹏说，国务院和各级政府要不折不扣地贯彻落实中央有关政策措施，兢兢业业做好工作，遇事同群众商量，倾听群众意见和呼声，注意及时发现问题，解决问题。
    在谈到物价问题时，李鹏指出，确保今年物价上涨幅度明显低于去年，是今年政府工作重要的奋斗目标。他说，管好物价是中央、地方政府、企业和商业部门的共同责任，要靠社会各方面共同努力，并实行有效的群众监督。
    在谈到如何缓解当前资金困难的状况时，李鹏说，一个重要方面是，要发扬爱国主义精神，提倡储蓄，这样既利国又利民。
    李鹏总理强调，治理整顿中尽管采用了一些应急的行政手段，但这是为了经济健康发展，决不会回到过去过度集中、管得过多过死的老路上去。
    　　　　胡启立：民主决策范围要扩大
    据新华社北京３月２３日电　（记者欧洋、吴士深）曾任天津市市长的胡启立今天作为人大代表来到天津代表团参加对政府工作报告的审议。他说，治理整顿、深化改革，不能孤军深入，也不能头疼医头、脚痛医脚，必须扩大民主决策的范围，广泛听取各阶层人民的意见。
    胡启立说，改革是全国人民的事，必须发扬党的实事求是和从群众中来、到群众中去的优良传统，提高领导机关活动的开放程度，搞科学决策、民主决策。
    胡启立说，现实生活中矛盾很多，也很复杂，更应群策群力，发挥群体智力优势。他打了个比方，中医讲气血平衡，现在经济发展有点失衡，这就需要大家来把脉、分析。也许有些“诊断”意见很难听、很尖刻，但是只要是实事求是的，我们就应该认真听取。
    　　　　王震：民族团结需要加强
    本报北京３月２３日讯　记者袁建达报道：发展民族经济，维护民族团结，这是新疆代表团今天审议政府工作报告的“主旋律”。国家副主席王震、全国人大常委会副委员长赛福鼎·艾则孜以人大代表身份参加了讨论。
    王震在发言中说，通过治理、整顿，新疆要出现一个新气象，登上一个新台阶，这就需要加强民族团结，维护祖国统一。
    赛福鼎·艾则孜在发言中认为，要保持新疆的发展势头，就必须认真贯彻落实党和国家的民族政策，进一步发展平等、团结、互助的新型的民族关系。对破坏民族团结进步的言行要坚决进行斗争。
    　　　　田纪云：农业转折已到时候
    本报北京３月２３日讯　本报记者莫新元、新华社记者曹绍平报道：国务院副总理田纪云昨天下午到出席七届全国人大二次会议的贵州代表团听取讨论三个报告的意见，并同代表们着重座谈了农业问题。
    贵州省王朝文代表谈到，目前贵州省粮食问题比较严峻。贵州省制定了五年发展粮食生产计划，除本省增加投入外，希望国务院在资金上给予支持。
    田纪云副总理说，农业问题，不仅是贵州经济工作的难点，也是全国经济工作的难点，现在到了农业转折的时候了，如果再不下决心狠抓这个问题，将会贻误大事。
    田纪云还认为，发展贵州省农业要围绕改造中低产田，提高单位面积产量做文章。要重视保护生态环境，切不可毁林造田。
