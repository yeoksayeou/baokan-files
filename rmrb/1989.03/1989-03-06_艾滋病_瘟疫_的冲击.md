The Impact of the AIDS "Plague"

By Li Jiade

By the end of last year, the number of AIDS patients worldwide had reached over 130,000. Under the impact of AIDS, people's lifestyles and moral concepts have begun to change.

AIDS, dubbed the "plague of the 20th century," has spread across five continents, with the number of patients increasing rapidly (see table). According to recent statistics from the World Health Organization, by the end of 1988, the cumulative number of AIDS patients worldwide had reached 132,976 (due to various reasons, the actual number of patients far exceeds this official statistic, possibly exceeding 350,000). The number of AIDS virus carriers is estimated to be between 5 million and 10 million. The organization estimates that currently, one person is infected with AIDS every minute. It is predicted that by 1991, there will be one million new AIDS cases, and the number of deaths will exceed half of that number. This is indeed a grim picture.

The United States remains the country with the highest number of AIDS patients. In June 1981, the first AIDS patients were discovered in the United States, with only five cases at the time. Two years later, the number of victims had increased to 1,641, of whom 644 had already died. By April 1985, the number had risen to 9,405 cases, with 4,533 deaths. To date, the number of AIDS patients in the United States has reached over 80,500. According to estimates from the U.S. health department, by 1991, the number of AIDS patients in the United States will reach 270,000. A report published in the Australian newspaper in early March last year stated that scientists predict that by the year 2000, unless a preventive vaccine is developed, the number of AIDS patients in the United States alone could reach 5 million, and the total number of patients worldwide could reach 25 million.

Currently, the medical community generally believes that the main transmission routes of AIDS are through homosexual and heterosexual contact. Professor Frerichs of the University of Munich emphasized that the spread of AIDS in heterosexuals is faster than in homosexuals. Of course, this does not apply to monogamous heterosexuals. He also said that in West Berlin, the infection rate of the AIDS virus among drug users has reached 67.4%.

In mid-June last year, at the Fourth International AIDS Conference held in Stockholm, representatives emphasized that the spread of AIDS is not only a scientific issue but also a social issue. They called on people to have healthy sexual habits and normal sexual behavior.

In the past few years, generally speaking, AIDS patients were limited to some groups that had deviated from normal social life, such as homosexuals and drug addicts who inject drugs. However, in recent years, the occurrence of cases is no longer limited to the above groups and almost involves all strata of society.

AIDS, also known as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, spreads rapidly and has a very high mortality rate. The mortality rate of patients within two to three years of onset is 70%, and the final mortality rate is 100%. This situation has caused great panic among people. For example, in Michigan, USA, an AIDS patient spat at a police officer, and was charged with attempted murder, because saliva also contains the AIDS virus. Although experts are confident that occasional contact will not result in infection, it cannot dispel people's fear. Among healthy people, some are afraid to go to public places, even shaking hands with others makes them nervous and suspicious. Some actors refuse to perform scenes with kissing, and even doctors and nurses are reluctant to treat AIDS patients. Some places even do not allow students with AIDS to attend school, and do not allow people with AIDS antibodies to enter cafes, restrooms, and swimming pools.

Under the impact of this "plague" of AIDS, the lifestyles and moral concepts of some people in the West have begun to change: they openly oppose homosexuality and begin to emphasize family values. Especially in the United States, the phenomenon of people having only one spouse in their lifetime is increasing again. The sex industry is declining. For example, the most famous red-light district in Tokyo, Japan, the Yoshiwara, has seen various brothels becoming "desolate with few visitors," which is a phenomenon that has never been seen before.

Although advocates of "sexual liberation" have not all restrained themselves, some people in the West have indeed begun to feel afraid of indulgence. Because, in people's eyes, getting AIDS is no different from being sentenced to "death row."

### 艾滋病“瘟疫”的冲击

　　艾滋病“瘟疫”的冲击
    李家德
    到去年底，全世界艾滋病患者已达十三万多人。在艾滋病的冲击下，人们的生活方式和道德观念开始发生变化。
    被称为“二十世纪瘟疫”的艾滋病，蔓延世界五大洲，患者人数迅速增加（见图表）。据世界卫生组织最近的统计，截至一九八八年底，全世界艾滋病患者累计已达十三万二千九百七十六人（因各种原因，患者人数远远高出这个正式统计数，可能已超过三十五万人），艾滋病病毒携带者为五百万到一千万。该组织估计，目前每分钟就有一人感染上艾滋病。预计到一九九一年，将会有一百万新艾滋病例，死亡人数会过半数。这实在是一幅严峻的图景。
    美国仍是艾滋病人数最多的国家。一九八一年六月，首次在美国发现艾滋病患者，当时仅五人。两年后，受害者即增至一千六百四十一人，其中六百四十四人已经死亡。到一九八五年四月，已上升到九千四百零五例，死亡人数四千五百三十三人。迄今，美国艾滋病患者已达八万零五百多人。据美国卫生部门估计，到一九九一年，美国艾滋病患者将达二十七万人。去年三月初出版的《澳大利亚人报》报道，科学家们预计，到二○○○年，除非能研制出一种预防疫苗，否则单是美国艾滋病患者的人数即可达五百万人，全世界的患者总数将达二千五百万人。
    目前，医学界一般认为，艾滋病的主要传播途径是男性同性恋者和异性接触。慕尼黑大学细菌学教授弗勒斯纳尔强调指出，艾滋病在异性恋中的传染比同性恋中快。当然，固定异性恋的人不在此例。他还说，在西柏林，吸毒者中受到艾滋病病毒感染的已高达百分之六十七点四。
    去年六月中旬，在斯德哥尔摩召开的第四次国际艾滋病会议上，代表们强调，艾滋病的蔓延不仅是一个科学问题，而且是一个社会问题，呼吁人们要有一个健康的性习惯和正常的性行为。
    在过去几年中，一般地说，艾滋病患者仅限于一些脱离社会正常生活的群体，诸如同性恋者，以注射方式吸毒的瘾君子等。但是，近年来发生的病例已不再限于上述群体，几乎涉及社会各个阶层。
    艾滋病也就是获得性免疫缺陷综合症。它的传播速度快，死亡率极高。患者发病后二至三年的死亡率为百分之七十，最终病死率为百分之一百，这种状况引起了人们的极大恐慌。例如，在美国密执安州一名艾滋病患者向警察啐了几口唾沫，被指控为谋杀罪，由于唾沫内也含有艾滋病毒。尽管，专家们确信，偶尔的接触并不会染上此病，但仍不能消除人们的恐惧心理。在健康人中，有的不敢到公共场所活动，连跟他人握手都提心吊胆，戒心重重。有的演员拒绝演有接吻动作的戏，甚至医生、护士也不愿接待艾滋病患者。有些地方甚至不让有艾滋病的学生上学，不许带有艾滋病抗体的人进入咖啡厅、洗手间和游泳池。
    在艾滋病这股“瘟疫”冲击下，西方一些人的生活方式和道德观念开始发生变化：对同性恋持公开的反对态度，开始注重家庭价值观念等。特别是在美国，目前一人一生只找一个配偶的现象又开始增多。色情行业由盛而衰。如日本东京最负盛名的吉原红灯区，各家妓院开始变得“门前冷落车马稀”，这是前所未有的现象。
    虽然主张“性解放”者并非个个都收敛了，但是西方一些人对于纵欲确实开始感到恐惧。因为，在人们的眼里，得了艾滋病无异于被判了“死缓”。
