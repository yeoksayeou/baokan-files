In Italian government offices, the phenomenon of empty offices is quite common. The phrase "the doctor is not in the office" has become a well-known saying among government employees, implying that they are busy in cafes or at spas. A private investigation agency named "Rights and Responsibilities" conducted a survey in various government departments and concluded that the discipline in these departments is far less strict than commonly imagined. Each department has numerous facilities such as bars, food stores, entertainment venues, and cultural art galleries, totaling around 200. Additionally, many barbers and tailors are employed. These facilities are more than enough to keep employees occupied.

The investigation agency also discovered that in Italy, approximately 4.5 million state employees, in addition to their legal holidays, manage to take an extra 34 days of leave each year. State Secretary Costa stated that this alone results in a yearly loss of about $300 billion for the national treasury.

Employees who frequently skip work are not always just enjoying coffee; many are busy with second jobs. In the capital, Rome, about 70% of mid- and lower-level employees have second jobs. Prison guards also work as street cleaners, postal workers become plumbers after hours, and even the doorman at the Prime Minister's office runs a grocery store in the same district. Two economists recently found that compared to private enterprises, state employees have a labor productivity that is 20% to 40% lower. The reason for this phenomenon is that employees frequently skip work, and those who do come to work often do not put in much effort. State employees dare to disregard the law because they have "iron rice bowls" and enjoy superior social welfare benefits.

To change the phenomenon of frequent absenteeism, the government has tried various methods, such as establishing attendance bonuses, but with little effect. Recently, the parliament proposed a bill stating that long-term unexcused absenteeism should be punished with imprisonment of 1 to 3 years. This legal draft was proposed by the Socialist Party and supported by the Christian Democratic Party. The chairman of the Christian Democratic Party's parliamentary group, Nicotra, explained that the purpose of this law is to punish those who are "negligent in their duties."

This legal draft has caused a stir in society and has drawn significant opposition. It is reported that this proposal will not be easily approved by the parliamentary legal committee and put into effect.

　　用法律来破“空城计”
    在意大利政府机关里，办公室唱“空城计”是常有的事。“博士不在办公室”已成机关里人人皆知的行话，其含意是：他们在咖啡厅或在温泉浴室里“忙着”哩！一家名为“权利与责任”的私人调查机构，深入到政府各部作了一番调查研究，得出的结论是：政府各部的纪律远没有常人想象的那么严格。各部门内设有的酒吧、食品店、娱乐场、文化艺术展厅有２００来个，此外，还聘有许多理发师、裁缝。这么多的设施，足够职工消磨时光的。
    这个调查机构还发现，在意大利，约４５０万国家职工在法定的节假日外平均为自己额外地“弄到”３４天的假期。国务秘书科斯塔说，仅此一项，国库每年就减少约３００亿美元的收入。
    上班经常缺勤的职工，并不是都在喝咖啡消磨时光，许多人忙得不亦乐乎——从事第二职业。在首都罗马，约有７０％的中、下级职工有第二职业。狱吏兼作巡道工，邮局职工下班后当管道工，甚至总理府的门房在总理府所在的区里开爿食品店，都是寻常事。两名经济学家最近的调查表明，和私人企业相比，国家职工的劳动生产率低２０％到４０％。造成这种现象的原因是职工经常缺勤，上了班的，也是出工不出力。国家职工之所以敢于如此无视法律，是因为有“铁饭碗”，又享有优越的社会福利保障。
    为改变上班缺勤现象，政府想过不少办法，如设立“出勤奖”，但成效不大。不久前，议会提出了一项草案，其内容是：长期无故缺勤，应受刑事处分，监禁１至３年。该项法律草案是社会党人提出的，得到了天民党的支持。议会天民党党团主席尼古特拉解释说：制定这项法律，目的在于惩处那些“不尽职”的人。
    此项法律草案已引起了社会的震动，招来了不少反对之声。据料，这项提案要得到议会法律委员会的批准并付诸实施，将不是一帆风顺的。
