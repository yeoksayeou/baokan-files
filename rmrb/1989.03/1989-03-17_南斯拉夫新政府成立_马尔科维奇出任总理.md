The new government of Yugoslavia was established today, with Ante Marković unanimously elected as the Chairman of the Federal Executive Council (Prime Minister) by the Federal Assembly to succeed Mikulić, who resigned on December 30 last year. He is the ninth Prime Minister since Yugoslavia adopted the cabinet system in 1963, with a term of four years.

The Federal Assembly also, based on Marković's nominations, elected eighteen new government members (one position temporarily vacant, to be filled later), including five from the previous government. Their average age is fifty, making this the youngest government to date. A. Mitrović and Ž. Preger were elected as Vice-Chairmen of the Federal Executive Council (Deputy Prime Ministers). The Federal Assembly also appointed twelve federal ministers. The previous government's Minister of Foreign Affairs, B. Lončar, and Minister of Defense, V. Kadijević, retained their positions, while the Minister of the Interior is now P. Gračanin, former Chairman of the Presidency of the Republic of Serbia. Compared to the previous government, this government has reduced ten members, abolished two ministries and six federal committees. In selecting new government members, priority was given to their political qualifications, personal qualities, and professional abilities, effectively abolishing the previous principle of equal representation from each republic and autonomous province. New government members have clear authority and responsibilities, accountable not only to the federal government but also to the Yugoslav Parliament and the entire society. All these are reforms carried out during the government organization process.

After the election, Marković led the new government members to solemnly take the oath of office in the Assembly. Marković delivered a speech on the new government's policy agenda in the Assembly, emphasizing that the new government will make every effort to develop production, increase exports, curb severe inflation, and overcome the current economic crisis. To this end, comprehensive socio-economic reforms are necessary, establishing a unified market, strengthening economic efficiency, and democracy. The establishment and commencement of work of the new Yugoslav government bring hope to the Yugoslav people living in economic crisis and social unrest.

　　南斯拉夫新政府成立  马尔科维奇出任总理
    本报贝尔格莱德三月十六日电  记者严正报道：南斯拉夫联邦议会今天一致选举安特·马尔科维奇为联邦执委会主席（即政府总理），以接替去年十二月三十日辞职的米库利奇的职务。他是南斯拉夫自一九六三年开始实行总理内阁制以来的第九任总理，任期四年。
    联邦议会还根据马尔科维奇的提名，选举了十八名新政府成员（暂空一个名额，以后补选），其中五人是上届政府的成员。他们的平均年龄五十岁，是迄今为止最年轻的一届政府。阿·米特罗维奇和日·普雷格尔当选为联邦执委会副主席（即政府副总理）。联邦议会同时还任命了十二名联邦部长。上届政府的外交部长布·隆查尔、国防部长韦·卡迪耶维奇都留任原职，内务部长则由原塞尔维亚共和国主席团主席佩·格拉查宁担任。与上届政府相比，本届政府成员精减了十名，撤销了两个部和六个联邦委员会。在选举新政府的成员时，首先考虑的是他们的政治素质、人的品质和业务能力，实际上已取消了过去各共和国、自治省均等派代表的原则。新政府成员都有明确的权限和职责，不仅向联邦政府，而且向南斯拉夫议会和整个社会负责。所有这些都是在组织政府过程中进行的改革。
    选举结束后，马尔科维奇带领新政府成员在议会庄重宣誓就职。马尔科维奇在议会上就新政府的施政纲领发表讲话，其要点是新政府将以一切努力发展生产增加出口，制止大幅度的通货膨胀，克服目前的经济危机。为此，要进行全面的社会经济改革，建立统一的市场，加强经济效能和民主等，南斯拉夫新政府的成立并开始工作，给处在经济危机和社会动荡中生活的南斯拉夫人民带来希望。
