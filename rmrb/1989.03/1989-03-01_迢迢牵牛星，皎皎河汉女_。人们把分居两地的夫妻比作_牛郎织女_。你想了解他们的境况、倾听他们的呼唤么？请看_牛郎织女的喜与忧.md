The Ministry of Personnel revealed that currently, there are 360,000 couples among national cadres and workers who are separated and living in different places.

This number first indicates progress. In 1979, there were 1 million cadres and workers in China whose spouses were living in different places. Over the past 9 years, personnel departments at all levels have worked hard to bring together 900,000 "Cowherd and Weaver Girl" couples. The problem of spouses living in different places—a uniquely Chinese social issue—is gradually being alleviated.

The alleviation of the problem of spouses living in different places has eliminated a major concern for many cadres and workers. Without this concern, they can boldly move forward. Zhang Qiran is an example. His wife originally worked as a farmer in the suburbs of Zibo, Shandong, while he worked in another city. In 1982, the Zibo Municipal Personnel Bureau made great efforts to transfer Zhang Qiran to the Zibo City Epidemic Prevention Station and, according to regulations, helped his wife with the "agricultural to non-agricultural" transfer, allowing this couple, who had been separated for over 20 years, to reunite. Zhang Qiran threw himself into his work with great enthusiasm. He wrote several high-value academic papers, developed a new type of immune diagnostic reagent, and passed the provincial-level appraisal. In 1984, he was appointed as the Director of the Zibo City Health Bureau and later became the Secretary of the Zibo City Health Bureau Party Committee.

Zhang Qiran is not the only lucky one. In recent years, the Shandong Provincial Personnel Department has worked hard to provide convenience for solving the problem of cadres' spouses living in different places. Regardless of the length of separation, as long as the individual is willing to work in the spouse's location, the relevant personnel departments will handle the transfer without any additional conditions. Over the past 8 years, 72,000 separated couples of cadres in the province have reunited. In 1987, the proportion of separated cadres in the province dropped from 9.3% at the end of 1979 to 0.8%.

Every year, an average of more than 100,000 couples in China end their "Cowherd and Weaver Girl" life. However, since 1983, nearly 100,000 new "Cowherd and Weaver Girl" couples emerge each year. Among these, many are recent graduates from colleges and universities. Due to poor allocation, these young people start singing "Newlywed Farewell" as soon as they enter the workforce. Some are constrained by the "unit ownership system," unable to move, and their separation issues remain unresolved. Some places also implement "local policies," erecting new barriers to solving separation issues. For example, some cities require 40,000 yuan to add one household registration. For cadres and workers with a monthly income of only a hundred yuan, this means they would have to save for 40 years without eating or drinking to gather this amount of money. Even if the unit pays, it is still a heavy burden! Therefore, spouses living in different places has become a "cutting but not severed, untangling but still chaotic" social problem.

The family is the cell of society, and spouses are the mainstay of the family. When spouses live in different places, they often sleep alone under the cold moon, rarely enjoying the warmth and joy of a happy marriage. This is an abnormal family life that affects the spouses' dependence and emotional attachment, causing instability in work and life. The affected individuals lose the good mechanism of balanced emotions, often leading their marriages down a difficult and stormy path. Marital breakups are not uncommon, and sexual crimes and social instability factors are induced. The natural structure of the family is destroyed, and the family's educational and caregiving functions are greatly weakened. Many children, without proper guidance, go astray, and many elderly people, without care, are filled with worries.

Cadres and workers who live in different places are entitled to a certain amount of time off for family visits each year, and the state pays for their travel expenses and wages during the leave. Based on the current number of separated individuals, the state needs to provide over 10 million workdays each year, equivalent to 30,000 people not working for a year. If each worker creates 70,000 yuan of value per year, plus the travel expenses, the state loses 2.2 billion yuan annually. This not only consumes national funds but also wastes labor time, causing traffic congestion and disorder, which is detrimental to both families and the state.

Look at the train stations and docks before and after holidays. The bustling crowd, sweating and jostling, the crying babies in their mothers' arms, the long queues at the ticket windows, the tearful farewells of loved ones, the arduous journeys... all form a multi-colored picture of life. It sends a call to the whole society: please give the Cowherd and Weaver Girl couples more care!

Of course, everyone knows that solving the problem of spouses living in different places requires a process.

　　“迢迢牵牛星，皎皎河汉女”。人们把分居两地的夫妻比作“牛郎织女”。你想了解他们的境况、倾听他们的呼唤么？请看——
    牛郎织女的喜与忧
    本报记者  舒瑜
    国家人事部有关人士透露：目前全国干部职工两地分居的夫妻有３６万！
　　这个数字首先表示了一种进步。１９７９年，我国夫妻两地分居的干部职工共１００万。９年来，全国各级人事部门广搭鹊桥，使９０万“牛郎织女”喜得团聚。夫妻分居两地——一个独具中国特色的社会问题逐步得到缓解。
    夫妻两地分居问题的缓解，消除了一大批干部职工的后顾之忧。没有后顾之忧，就可以大胆地往前走了。张启然就是一个例子。他的妻子原在山东淄博市郊区当农民，而自己在外市工作。１９８２年，淄博市人事局多方努力，将张启然调到淄博市防疫站，并按规定为他的妻子办理了“农转非”，使这一对两地分居长达２０多年的夫妻阖家团聚。张启然满腔热情投入工作。他撰写出多篇有较高价值的学术论文，研制出一种新型的免疫诊断试剂，并通过了省级鉴定。１９８４年，他被任命为淄博市卫生局局长，不久又被选为市卫生局党委书记。
    张启然并不是唯一的幸运者。近几年来，山东省人事部门为解决干部夫妻两地分居问题努力提供方便，凡是夫妻分居的干部，不论分居时间长短，只要本人愿意到其配偶住地工作的，有关人事部门都不附加任何条件，随时办理调动手续。８年来，全省７．２万分居两地的干部夫妻团聚。１９８７年，全省分居干部所占比例由１９７９年底的９．３％下降到０．８％。
    我国平均每年有１０多万夫妻结束牛郎织女的生活。但是，从１９８３年以来，每年新涌现出的牛郎织女也近１０万。这部分人中，有不少是近年从大、中专院校分配的毕业生。由于分配考虑不周，这些青年人一踏上工作岗位便唱起了“新婚别”。有的受“单位所有制”的束缚，流不出，动不了，其分居问题迟迟得不到解决。还有一些地方制定“土政策”，为解决分居问题竖起新的路障。如有的城市规定，进一个户口收４万元。对于月收入才百多元的干部职工来说，就是不吃不喝，得熬４０年才能凑齐这笔钱。即使单位掏钱，也是一项难以承受的负担啊！因此，夫妻两地分居成为“剪不断、理还乱”的社会难题。
    家庭是社会的细胞，夫妻是家庭的主体。夫妻分居两地，冷月孤灯独眠，很少享受美满婚姻的温馨和欢悦，是家庭生活的一种失常。它影响夫妻的依赖关系和感情寄托，产生工作和生活上的不稳定感。当事者失去平衡感情的良好机制，往往使婚姻走上风雨飘摇的艰难里程，夫妻离异时有所闻，性犯罪和社会不安定因素因此诱发。家庭自然结构遭到破坏，家庭的教育和赡养职能大为削弱；有许多孩子因无人管教而走上歧途，有不少老人因无人照料而愁肠百结。
    两地分居的干部职工，每年要享受一定时间的探亲假，并由国家支付假期工资和往来路费。按现有分居人数估算，每年国家要提供１０００多万个工作日，相当于３万人长年不上班，若以每个职工每年创造７万元的价值来计算，再加上支付的车船费，国家每年要损失２２亿元。这样，既消耗了国家资金，又损失了劳动时间，还带来交通的拥挤和秩序的混乱，对家庭、对国家都是不利的。
    看看节假日前后的车站和码头吧。那散发汗气的熙熙攘攘的人流，折腾在母亲怀里的嗷嗷婴儿，售票窗前通宵不眠的长队，泪雨纷飞的亲人别离，备尝艰辛的长途跋涉……构成一幅幅多色调的生活画面。它，向全社会发出一声声呼唤：请给牛郎织女们更多一些关怀吧！
    当然，谁都知道，要解决夫妻两地分居，需要有个过程。
