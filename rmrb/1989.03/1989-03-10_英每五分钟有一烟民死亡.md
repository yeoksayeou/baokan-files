    Every Five Minutes a Smoker Dies in the UK
    Xinhua News Agency, London, March 8 (Reporter Wang Guorui) Today is the UK's National No-Smoking Day. The British Medical Association states that in the UK, 100,000 people die from smoking each year.

    Over the past 20 years, in other developed countries, the incidence of heart disease in men has decreased by 40%, and in women by 50%. However, in the UK, the incidence of heart disease in men has only decreased by 10%, and in women by 2%.

    Scientists say that passive smoking increases the risk of lung cancer by 30%.

    Health Secretary David Mellor says that smoking is the leading cause of death among middle-aged people in the UK.

    Among British teenagers who smoke, there are more girls than boys. One reason is that they mistakenly believe that smoking will prevent them from gaining weight and help them maintain a slim figure.

    Last month, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced a campaign to curb the increasing number of teenage smokers.

　　英每五分钟有一烟民死亡
    新华社伦敦３月８日电  （记者王国瑞）今天是英国全国禁烟日，英国医学协会说，在英国，每年有１０万人死于吸烟。
    在过去的２０年内，在其他的发达国家，男子心脏病发病率减少４０％，女子心脏病发病率减少５０％；而在英国，男子心脏病发病率只减少１０％，女子心脏病发病率只减少２％。
    科学家说，被动吸烟使得肺癌的危险性增加３０％。
    卫生国务大臣戴维·梅勒说，吸烟是英国中年人死亡的最主要的原因。
    在吸烟的英国少年中，女孩多于男孩，部分的原因是，她们误以为吸烟会使她们不发胖，保持身材苗条。
    上个月，英国首相撒切尔夫人宣布开展一项运动，以制止少年吸烟人数的增长。
