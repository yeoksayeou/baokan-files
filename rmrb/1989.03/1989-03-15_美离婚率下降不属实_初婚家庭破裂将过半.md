Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 13th.

A recent research report from the United States indicates that the government's claim that the U.S. divorce rate has been declining since the early 1980s is unfounded. The report states that currently, two-thirds of first marriages in the United States may end in divorce.

According to the "Current Population Survey" report published by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, the divorce rate in the U.S. was 2.5 per thousand in 1965, rising to 4.8 per thousand by 1975, 5.2 per thousand in 1980, and then declining to 4.8 per thousand by 1988. Some people believe that this decline in numbers indicates a revival of traditional family values.

However, a recent research report by two experts from the University of Wisconsin's Population Center, Larry Bumpass and Teresa Martin, argues that the report from the National Center for Health Statistics overlooks the widespread phenomenon of couples separating due to marital discord.

Bumpass and Martin state that current basic data show that 56% of newly married couples will likely break up within 40 years, and an additional 6% of newlyweds will eventually separate without formal divorce proceedings.

According to Bumpass, one reason for family breakdowns is the increase in cohabitation before marriage; another reason is early marriage. The research report shows that teenage girls who marry before reaching adulthood have a divorce rate twice as high as the general population.

　　美离婚率下降不属实  初婚家庭破裂将过半
    据新华社华盛顿３月１３日电  美国一份最新研究报告表明，政府所公布的从８０年代初开始美国离婚率趋于下降的调查是不属实的。报告说，目前，在第一次结婚的美国家庭中，有２／３的婚姻可能破裂。
    根据美国国家健康统计中心公布的《当前人口调查》报告，１９６５年美国人的离婚率是２．５‰，到１９７５年上升到４．８‰，１９８０年为５．２‰，而到１９８８年则下降到４．８‰。有人认为，这个数字的下降表明了传统的家庭价值的恢复。
    但是由威斯康星大学人口统计学中心的两位专家拉利·本帕斯和特丽萨·马丁所公布的最新研究报告认为，国家健康统计中心的那份报告忽视了夫妻因不和而分居的这种普遍现象。
    本帕斯和马丁说，现有的一些基本数据表明，５６％新近结第一次婚的家庭在４０年内将会破裂，另有６％的新婚夫妇将最终分居，但不办离婚手续。
    据本帕斯说，家庭破裂的原因之一是未婚同居者增多；另一原因是早婚。研究报告显示，十几岁的未成年少女结婚后离婚的可能比一般人要高出一倍。
