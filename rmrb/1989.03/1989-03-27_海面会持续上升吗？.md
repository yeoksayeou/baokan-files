In recent years, many scientists have issued warnings: humanity is facing the danger of continuously rising sea levels. According to the analysis from the Hamburg meeting of meteorologists last November: due to the large-scale burning of coal and oil by humans in recent years, various gases have entered the atmosphere, resulting in the greenhouse effect. By the mid-21st century, the global average temperature will rise by 2 to 4 degrees Celsius, and the rise in temperature will cause the polar ice caps to melt. From the end of this century to 2050, the world's oceans may rise by 40 to 140 centimeters.

This would be a disaster for humanity. It is well known that one-third of the world's population and most major cities are located in coastal areas and river deltas. Among the world's 35 largest cities, 20 are located along the coast. If the world's oceans rise by 40 to 140 centimeters, some coastal cities will be submerged by seawater. This is a major issue that affects the survival of all humanity.

However, some scientists do not agree with this pessimistic prediction. They believe that while the greenhouse effect will cause the atmospheric temperature to rise and the polar ice caps to melt, the process of ice melting will also absorb a large amount of heat, thereby lowering the Earth's temperature and offsetting the warming effect of the greenhouse effect. Additionally, due to the large-scale burning of coal, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases, and at the same time, dust also increases, which can block and reflect sunlight, creating an "umbrella effect." The greenhouse effect, the umbrella effect, and the cooling of the Earth due to ice melting will cause the Earth's atmospheric temperature to be in a state of dynamic equilibrium. Therefore, the world's oceans will not experience a significant rise.

Regardless of theoretical explanations, actual measurements show that the world's sea levels have risen by 10 to 20 centimeters in the past 100 years (from 1880 to 1980), leading to global sand beaches being eroded by seawater. Whether the world's sea levels will continue to rise remains a mystery to this day.

### 海面会持续上升吗？

　　海面会持续上升吗？
    近年来，许多科学家发出警告：人类正面临着海面持续上升的危险。根据去年十一月世界气象学家汉堡会议分析：由于近年来人类大量燃煤、烧油，各种气体逸入大气，从而产生温室效应，到二十一世纪中叶，全球平均气温将升高摄氏二至四度，而气温升高将导致两极冰川融化，从本世纪末到二○五○年，世界洋面可能上升四十至一百四十厘米。
    这对人类来说将是一场灾难。众所周知，世界上三分之一的人口和多数大城市都分布在海岸地带及大河河口地区，世界三十五个最大的城市中有二十个地处沿海。如果世界洋面上升四十至一百四十厘米，那么，一些沿海城市就会被海水淹没。这是关系到全人类生存的重大问题。
    不过，有些科学家并不同意这种悲观的预测。他们认为，温室效应虽会使大气气温升高，两极冰川融化，但在冰川融化的过程中，又会吸收大量热量，这样又会使地球气温降低，抵消温室效应的增温；此外，由于大量燃煤，大气中的二氧化碳增多，同时尘埃亦同步增多，这样就能起到阻挡和反射阳光的“阳伞效应”。温室效应、阳伞效应以及冰川融化导致的地球降温，使得地球大气的温度处于动态平衡状态，所以，世界洋面不会有大幅度的上升。
    不管理论上怎样解释，但据实际测量，世界海面在最近一百年（一八八○年到一九八○年）内，已经上升了十到二十厘米，导致了全球性的沙质海滩被海水吞食。世界海面究竟会不会持续上升，至今仍是个谜。
