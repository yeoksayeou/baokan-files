Title: Sound and Civilization

The annual Spring Festival and Lantern Festival have passed. Festivals often come with fire and explosion accidents caused by firecrackers. Fireworks are for the eyes, providing visual pleasure; firecrackers are for the ears, but they are certainly not pleasant to hear.

Since this thing is called a "firecracker," it must have existed long before the invention of gunpowder. Perhaps ancient people discovered that burning bamboo can produce a loud noise, so they used it to drive away wild beasts and imaginary demons. All animals, including humans, instinctively fear sudden loud noises. Therefore, the original purpose of firecrackers was probably to drive away and intimidate. Another purpose is to use their sound to indicate the presence of the person setting them off. The louder the sound, the higher the status of the person setting them off. If used in some activities or ceremonies, the strength of the sound naturally indicates the level of the activity. If setting off firecrackers is a form of enjoyment, it might be this psychological satisfaction. In a word, it is "suppressing others' morale and boosting one's own."

I have not studied the development and changes of sound in human civilization history. However, one thing is certain: in general, the love for explosive sounds is inversely proportional to one's cultural refinement. Not only are explosive sounds unappealing, but people's conversation volume also seems to be inversely proportional to their level of civilization. Shouting loudly and paying no attention to others is considered rude. The standard of civilization is that the volume of conversation should only be loud enough for the other person to hear. If every day is like a wedding or welcoming a foreign dignitary, it becomes a farce.

However, in China, the love for firecrackers seems to be increasing. The Spring Festival is not worth mentioning. Nowadays, it seems that weddings cannot do without firecrackers. As soon as the bride gets out of the car, firecrackers are immediately set off at her. Is this "driving away evil spirits" or a "warning shot"?

This traditional "firecracker culture" is very inconsistent with modern urban civilization! Dense residential buildings have already made it impossible for anyone to escape the noise interference from all directions. During festivals, the deafening sound of firecrackers and the suffocating smoke inside and outside the buildings make it a disaster. The whole world is trying every means to eliminate noise pollution, but Chinese people are still intoxicated by the sound of firecrackers, enjoying the ancestral pleasure. You might say that China's education budget is small and always ranks at the bottom in the world; but if you compare the consumption of firecrackers, it is definitely the highest in the world.

Every year during the Spring Festival, the public security, traffic, and medical departments have to be very busy. Busy with what? Preventing passengers from bringing firecrackers onto vehicles, extinguishing fires caused by firecrackers, and rescuing people injured by firecrackers. However, while preventing and treating the disasters caused by firecrackers, they are still produced in large quantities.

People always say that the Chinese government controls too much, but it depends on what should be controlled. In the past, many things that should not have been controlled were controlled, and many things that should have been controlled were not. Firecrackers seriously endanger the safety of people's lives and property and have become a major public hazard. They should indeed be strictly controlled. Even if they are 100% safe, they are still a form of noise pollution. Of course, it is a traditional culture. But tradition is not sacred and unchangeable. It can and should be replaced with civilized elements from traditional culture, and the dross should be removed, not indulged.

Human life indeed needs sound, but civilized life needs "music" rather than noise. Of course, international exchanges still use salute cannons, and their sound is even louder. However, salute cannons belong to military etiquette, a remnant of war, and may not be able to be preserved forever. Why should civilian cultural activities be accompanied by explosions? As for creating a lively atmosphere, it is not necessary to use gunpowder. Percussion instruments like drums are also effective.

This year, many places have strengthened the management of fireworks and firecrackers, preventing many accidents. This is a good sign. However, just controlling the surface of the problem may not be enough. We should address the root cause and gradually eliminate this bad habit (of course, there is the issue of properly guiding and placing the workers involved). This is not only a safety issue but also an issue of changing customs. Let us bid farewell to the "firecracker culture"!

    音响与文明
    李洪林
    一年一度的春节、元宵节过去了。年节常常要伴随着烟花爆竹引起的火灾或爆炸事故。烟花是给人看的，还有悦目作用；爆竹是给人听的，但它决不悦耳。
    此物既然叫作“爆竹”，总比火药的发明早得多吧。大概原始人已经发现竹子燃烧时可以爆出巨响，于是就用来驱赶野兽和想象中的魔鬼。因为一切动物，包括人类在内，无不害怕突发的巨响，这是他们的本能。因此爆竹的原始作用大概就是驱赶和恐吓。另一个作用是以它的音响表明燃放者的存在。声音越大，燃放者的身价就越高。如果用于某种活动或仪式，音响的强弱自然表明该项活动的规格之高低。如果说燃放爆竹是一种享受的话，可能就是这种心理上的满足。用一句陈言，就是“灭他人志气，长自己威风”。
    我没有研究过人类文明史上音响的发展变化。不过有一点是可以肯定的：在一般情况下，对爆炸声的爱好，总是和人的文化素养成反比。不光爆炸声不会讨人喜欢，就是人们的谈话声，好像也和文明水平成反比。大喊大叫，旁若无人，被认为是粗野的表现。文明的准则是，谈话的声音，只要能让对方听清就可以了。倘若天天如婚礼，如迎国宾，便成为闹剧了。
    然而在中国，对鞭炮的喜爱却有与日俱增的趋势。春节自不必说。现在结婚好像非有鞭炮不可了。新娘一下车，立刻迎头饷以鞭炮。把新娘震得三魂出窍，是“驱邪”还是“下马威”？
    这种传统的“鞭炮文化”和现代都市文明显得很不协调！稠密的居民楼已经使每个人都逃不脱上下左右的噪音干扰，逢年过节还要加上楼内外震耳欲聋的爆竹声音和令人窒息的烟气。实在是一场灾难。全世界都在千方百计消除噪音污染，中国人却仍陶醉在爆竹声中享受祖传的乐趣。你别看中国的教育经费比重很小，在世界上总是排在后头；如果比爆竹的消费数量，肯定是世界之最。
    每年春节前后，公安、交通和医疗部门都要大忙一阵。忙什么呢？防止旅客把爆竹带上车船，扑灭爆竹引起的火灾，救护被爆竹炸伤的人们。但是，一面在预防和治理爆竹的灾难，一面却大量生产。
    都说中国政府管得太多，这要看该不该管。过去是管了许多不该管的事，有些该管的事却没有管。鞭炮如此严重地危害人民生命财产的安全，已经成为一大公害，实在应该严管。即使百分之百的安全，也是一种噪音污染。当然它是一种传统文化。但传统不是神圣不可改变的，可以而且应当把传统文化中粗野的成分用文明的成分来代替，糟粕应该剔除，而不应该迁就。
    人类生活固然需要音响，不过文明生活需要的是“乐音”而不是噪音。当然国际交往中仍在使用礼炮，那响声更加巨大。不过礼炮属于军礼，是战争的痕迹，也未必能永久保存下去。民间的文化活动何必配以爆炸？至于要造成某种热烈的气氛，也不是非用火药不可，锣鼓等打击乐器不是也可以吗？
    今年许多地方已经对烟花爆竹加强了管理，杜绝了很多事故。这是好的苗头。不过对爆竹光是扬汤止沸恐怕不行，应该釜底抽薪，逐步取消这个陋俗（从业人员当然有个妥善引导和安置的问题）。这不仅是个安全问题，同时也是一个移风易俗的问题。让我们和“爆竹文化”告别吧！
