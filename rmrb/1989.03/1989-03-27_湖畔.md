Title: By the Lake

I hear you stirring in the ancient oar sounds, your withered body shifting. I hear the wind flute gently passing over the pale reeds.

There is rain, falling from the wild, gray sky like a curtain. I silently row my boat in your tranquil heart, your heart that has weathered countless storms.

I strike your rippling waves with my young ankles, I read the stories that flow within you. I see all those waves that rose and then subsided, now forever sunk into the dark depths of your lake bed.

Fish swim through the sturdy nets, living and breeding in your eternal cold.

My restless heart drifts like fire, I sneak into your bright, muddy waves. You endlessly stir your silent body, erasing the slipping dreams time and time again.

Countless noisy days sink down from the swaying little boat, and yet new dawns quickly rise. Your soft tendrils, from the already blurred years, have been grinding away at the embankments that imprison you.

Birdsong echoes, the whistle echoes.

A single oar dips into the water, tracing the sunset, tracing the sunset.

　　湖畔
    肖宁
    我听见你在古老的橹声里翻动衰微的躯体，我听见风箫缓缓浮过初黄的芦苇。
    有雨，自灰帘似的野天飞下，我默默泛舟你宁静的湖心。你的敛息了无数风暴的湖心。
    我用我年轻的脚踝拍击你漾动的波纹，我细读你流溢于中的往事，我看到所有那些卷起又抛下的涛澜，如今都已永远地没入了幽冥的湖底。
    一条条游鱼，穿破结实的鱼网，生生息息在你与生俱有的寂冷之中。
    我躁动的心飘流如火，我潜行你发亮的浊波里。你无休无止翻动你无言的躯体，一次次抹去滑落的幻梦。
    数不清的喧闹的日子，从晃晃荡荡的小船上沉下来、沉下来，又总有新鲜的黎明匆匆浮起，而你柔软的触须，自早已模糊的年月，一直一直磨碾着囚禁你的堤岸。
    鸟鸣悠辽，哨音悠辽。
    点一篙水珠划向晚霞、划向晚霞。
