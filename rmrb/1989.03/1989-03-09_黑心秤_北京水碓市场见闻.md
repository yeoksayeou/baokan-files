Title: The "Black-Hearted Scales" – Observations from Beijing's Shuijiao Market

	“No cheating, no money” is the mindset of many vendors.

	“Bananas are cheap, 8 jiao per pound.” “Pears are on sale, 7 jiao per pound.”

	Recently, Beijing's agricultural markets have seen vendors competing to lower prices. First-time visitors to Beijing might be surprised by how cheap the goods are in the capital's agricultural markets. However, when you actually go to buy something, you might get tricked.

	The other day, management personnel from the Chaoyang District Industrial and Commercial Bureau conducted a surprise inspection of the stalls in Xiaozhuang. They discovered the vendors' secret to lowering prices from the confiscated weights. Some of these weights had holes drilled in them, while others had chunks removed. After this treatment, 1 pound would be short by 3 taels.

	The bureau's officials said that since the call to stop excessive price increases gained momentum, some individual vendors started using "black-hearted scales" to indirectly raise prices. Unlicensed vendors were particularly bad.

	I, the reporter, have also been cheated.

	That time, I bought 5 pounds of bananas from a bearded vendor near the Shuijiao Bus Station. I was shortchanged by 2 pounds. When I confronted him, the vendor arrogantly shouted, “I’m not afraid of the police!”

	Seeing that I wasn't buying his act, the bearded man immediately changed his tune, returning money to my pocket while pitifully saying, “Brother, these days, if you don't cheat, you can't make money!”

	Not cheating means not making money has become the mindset of many vendors.

	I also witnessed the following scene: A customer from Shaanxi noticed that the scales were short on goods and decided not to buy. The vendor, however, grabbed him and wouldn't let him go, even resorting to fists and feet. The old man cried, indignant, saying, “These individual vendors are just too tyrannical!”

	Why are individual businessmen's business practices deteriorating?

	Opinion one: Lack of basic vocational ethics education leads them to do anything for money. In the future, this aspect of work should be strengthened, and some advanced businessmen should be set as models.

	Opinion two: In the current situation, relying mainly on ideological and political education is no longer effective, and it is not realistic to prevent people from chasing money. In recent years, the method of setting up models has not been lacking, but the impact has been minimal. In a competition, just advocating friendship first is not enough. You can advocate for the first place, but it must be done within certain rules, and there must be referees to supervise. In recent years, the tendency of individual vendors to not follow the rules has been serious, mainly because management work has not kept up. The penalties for individual vendors breaking the law are too light, and they are limited to economic penalties, making the gains from breaking the law much greater than the "losses" from being penalized, which also encourages illegal behavior.

	Opinion three: State-owned commerce has not played its role as the main channel. If the goods in state-owned stores are of good quality and low price, it would put pressure on these vendors. However, state-owned stores are often the opposite, with poor quality, high prices, and cold-faced salespeople, naturally giving way to the market for vendors' bad practices.

	Opinion four: There is no real competition among individual vendors, and some feudal guild monopolistic habits are on the rise. For example, in the stall groups, everyone has the same price, rising and falling together. Whoever wants to make a thin profit and sell more, provide better service, and attract customers will be the one to suffer.

	Several farmers said they wanted to directly enter the city market and compete with the second-tier vendors. However, to find a place to stand in the city, they not only have to pay tribute to the management department but also have to hand over part of their earnings to the "landlords."

	Opinion five: Now, only the management department supervises the vendors, but the management department is not supervised. Management personnel deal with individual businessmen every day, and once they are hit by a "sugar bullet," lawless vendors can run wild. The public suggests that the media act as a "third force" to strengthen supervision of the market.

### “黑心秤”——北京水碓市场见闻

　　“黑心秤”
    ——北京水碓市场见闻
    本报记者  张锦力
    △不坑人　赚不了钱△
    “香蕉便宜喽，８毛１斤。”“鸭梨大减价，７毛１斤。”
    最近，北京农贸市场上出现了摊贩竞相压价的现象。初来北京者会十分惊奇首都农贸市场的东西便宜。然而，当你真的去买，就要大上其当了。
    前几天，朝阳区工商局的管理人员对小庄一带的摊群进行了突击检查，从没收的秤砣上发现了摊贩压价的秘密。这些秤砣，有的被钻了眼，有的被挖掉一块，经过这番处理，１斤要少给３两。
    工商局的同志说，自从制止滥涨价呼声高涨后，一些个体摊贩就开始用“黑心秤”变相涨价，无照摊贩尤其严重。
    记者本人就曾遭过坑骗。
    那次，我从水碓汽车站附近一个满嘴大胡子摊贩手中买了５斤香蕉。竟少给２斤。找其论理，摊贩竟蛮横地叫道：“老子公安局都不怕。”
    见我没吃这一套，大胡子马上一反常态，一边往我兜里退钱，一边可怜巴巴地说：“哥们儿，现在做买卖，不坑人赚不了钱呀！”
    不坑人，赚不了钱已成为很多摊贩的心态。
    记者还目睹了这样一个场面：一个陕西老客看出秤上东西份量不足，不想买了。摊贩却拽住他不让走，还拳脚相加。这位老人潸然泪下，愤慨地说：“这些个体摊贩真是太霸道了！”
    △原因复杂　众说纷纭△
    为什么个体商贩经商作风趋于恶劣？
    看法之一：缺乏起码的职业道德教育，致使他们为了赚钱不择手段。今后，这方面工作应加强，树立一些先进经商户以作楷模。
    看法之二：在目前形势下，主要靠思想政治教育已经不行，不让人们向钱看也不现实。这几年树模范的办法也没少搞，但影响甚微。在一场锦标赛中，光搞友谊第一不行了，可以提倡比赛第一，但必须在一定规则下进行，必须有裁判来监督。这几年个体摊贩中不遵守规则的倾向严重，主要是管理工作没跟上。对个体摊贩违法处罚过轻，而且只限于经济处罚，使之违法获利比处罚“损失”大得多，这也纵容了违法行为。
    看法之三：国营商业没有作好主渠道作用。如果国营商店里的东西质好，价低，就会对这些摊贩形成压力，而国营商店往往相反，质次，价不低，还有售货员一副冷冰冰面孔，这自然为摊贩恶劣作风让出市场。
    看法之四：个体摊贩之间没有形成真正竞争，一些封建行帮垄断恶习正在抬头。如摊群里大家一个价，同涨同落。谁想薄利多销、优质服务，招徕顾客，谁就要倒霉。
    几位农民说，他们想直接进入城里市场，和二道贩子们竞争一番。可是要在城里找一块立锥之地，不仅要给管理部门上贡，还要把赚的钱拿出一部分交给“地霸”。
    看法之五：现在只有管理部门监督摊贩，而管理部门却无人监督。管理人员天天和个体商贩打交道，一旦被“糖弹”打中，不法商贩就可以横行霸道。群众提议舆论部门作为“第三种力量”，对市场加强监督。
