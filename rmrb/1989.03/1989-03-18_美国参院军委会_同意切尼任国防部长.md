Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 16th.

The United States Senate Armed Services Committee today unanimously approved Cheney to serve as the Secretary of Defense. It is expected that he will receive final confirmation in the full Senate meeting tomorrow. With this, all cabinet appointments for the Bush administration have been finalized.

President Bush nominated Cheney on March 11th. The Senate Armed Services Committee began hearings on March 14th and concluded that Cheney meets the standards for leading the Pentagon. It is believed that Cheney's swift confirmation is due to his respect from members of both parties in Congress, and it also indicates that after the controversy over the Tower nomination, the Senate, the government, and both parties in the Senate hope to mend the strained relations that had emerged.

    本报华盛顿３月１６日电  记者张启昕报道：美国参议院军事委员会今天一致同意切尼出任国防部长。预计他将在明天举行的参议院全体会议上得到最后确认。至此，布什政府的部长人选都已确定。
    布什总统是３月１１日提名切尼的。参议院军委会从３月１４日开始举行听证会，认为切尼符合入主五角大楼的标准。据认为，切尼迅速得到确认是他深受国会两党议员的尊重，同时也表明，在经历托尔问题的争论后，参议院和政府以及参议院的两党都希望弥合它们之间一度出现的紧张关系。
