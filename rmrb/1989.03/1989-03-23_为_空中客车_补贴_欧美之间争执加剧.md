**Subsidies for Airbus Intensify Euro-American Dispute**

The European Community Commission refuted on March 21st the U.S. accusation that Europe's Airbus has received subsidies, thereby harming U.S. interests. The trade conflict over the global civil aviation market between Europe and America is escalating.

Recently, the West German government proposed providing 4.3 billion West German Marks in subsidies to the companies in that country participating in the Airbus project, mainly the Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm aerospace company, to repay its debts and compensate for losses caused by the fluctuation of the Mark against the U.S. dollar. The European Community agreed to this plan on March 8th. The U.S., however, believes this move will seriously harm U.S. export interests and has written to the European Community, demanding formal consultations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) subsidy regulations. The European Community confirmed on the evening of March 20th that it had received the U.S. demand but the next day stated that the claim that the European Community's subsidies for Airbus violate GATT regulations is unfounded and that the U.S., which controls 75% of the world civil aviation market, would not suffer any harm as a result. Formal consultations on this matter under the GATT subsidy regulations will last for 30 days. If no resolution is reached, the matter will be referred to the GATT expert committee. Last June, a similar dispute occurred between Europe and America, with both sides accusing each other of "illegally" aiding their aircraft industries in the competition.

　　为“空中客车”补贴        
    欧美之间争执加剧
    本报布鲁塞尔３月２２日电  记者魏崴报道：３月２１日，欧洲共同体委员会就美国关于欧洲“空中客车”受到资助从而损害了美国利益的指责进行反驳，欧美争夺世界民航机市场的贸易冲突出现加剧之势。
    最近，西德政府建议，对该国参加“空中客车”制造的企业，主要是梅塞施米特—伯尔科—布洛姆宇航公司给予４３亿西德马克的补贴，以偿还其所欠债务和弥补马克与美元汇率浮动所造成的损失。３月８日，欧共体同意了西德此项计划。而美国认为此举将严重损害美国出口利益，为此致函欧共体，并要求按关贸总协定的补贴法规进行正式磋商。欧共体于３月２０日晚确认收到美的要求，但翌日却表示，欧共体补贴“空中客车”违反关贸总协定有关法规的说法站不住脚，控制世界民航机市场７５％的美国不可能因此遭到什么损害。按照关贸总协定补贴法，为此事举行的正式磋商将持续３０天。如果磋商得不到结果，则由关贸总协定专家委员会出面解决。去年６月间，欧美曾为此发生争吵，双方互相指责对方在竞争中“不合法地”资助自己的飞机制造业。
