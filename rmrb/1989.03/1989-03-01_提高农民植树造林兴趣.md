The annual afforestation campaign is about to begin, but every planting season, farmers complain. Why are farmers reluctant to plant trees?

Propaganda work lags behind. Farmers know that planting fruit trees can bring wealth, but they know little about the importance of afforestation in beautifying the environment, regulating the climate, and maintaining ecological balance. Relevant departments organize afforestation campaigns every year, but once the campaign is over, no one follows up.

Relevant departments only assign afforestation tasks without planning the afforestation layout or ensuring the supply of saplings, causing farmers economic burdens and affecting the quality of afforestation. Last year, our township government bought a truckload of saplings from another place. By the time farmers arrived with their carrying poles and tractors, the saplings had already been distributed by township cadres, leaving the farmers disappointed. Many farmers travel tens of kilometers to buy saplings, but the varieties are limited and have poor economic benefits. Due to the annual shortage of saplings and lack of unified planning, many farmers hastily plant a few trees in front of their houses and call it a day.

Forest management and protection work lag behind, dampening farmers' enthusiasm for planting trees. Due to the lack of supervision and effective measures by relevant departments, the situation of planting trees without seeing forests and greening without seeing greenery persists year after year.

We hope that relevant departments will think more about afforestation and greening, and more about the broad masses of farmers. They should plan ahead, improve the contract responsibility system for forest management and protection, and strive to do a good job in this year's afforestation work.

### 提高农民植树造林兴趣

　　提高农民植树造林兴趣
    一年一度的植树造林工作就要开始了，可每到植树季节，农民就发牢骚。农民们为啥不愿植树造林呢？
    宣传工作跟不上。农民们除了知道种植果树能致富外，对造林绿化能美化环境、调节气候、保护生态平衡等重要意义知道很少。而有关部门年年搞植树造林“一阵风”，风头一过，再也无人过问。
    有关部门只管分派植树造林任务，却不管造林统一规划和树苗来源，给农民造成了不少经济负担，也影响了造林质量。去年我乡政府从外地购进了一车树苗，等农民带着扁担、开着拖拉机赶去时，树苗早已被乡干部分光了，农民们只好扫兴而归。不少农民为寻找树苗跑几十公里路，购回的树苗品种单一，经济效益差。由于年年树苗短缺，缺少统一规划，不少农民草率地在房前屋后种些树就算了事。
    管林、护林工作跟不上，挫伤了农民的种树积极性。由于有关部门监督不严、措施不力，造成了年年造林不见林，年年绿化不见绿的状况。
    希望有关部门多为造林绿化着想，多为广大农民着想，及早规划，完善管林护林工作的承包责任制，力争把今年的造林工作做好。河南泌阳县高店乡文化站　刘家福　程青林
