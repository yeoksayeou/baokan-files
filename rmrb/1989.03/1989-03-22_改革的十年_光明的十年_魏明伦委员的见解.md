His Sichuan opera has a unique style, his essays are distinctive, and his political commentary is insightful.

Listen to his views:

"Currently, there are many problems in society. I believe the main issue is not caused by the reform, nor is it due to the reform itself, but rather that some of the old problems have not been fully addressed. Of course, the manifestations are different. For example, in the past, power dominated everything, and people were harmed by power. Now, money rules everything, and people are corrupted by money. The focus has shifted from power to money. At first glance, it seems like a new problem, but in reality, it is a residual issue and cannot be blamed on the reform. Some people have nostalgia for the past, which is wrong. I believe that the decade of reform has been a decade of brightness, unparalleled in any other era in China. The Third Plenum saved China, and I have always said so."

"Reform should bring benefits to the people on one hand, and on the other hand, it should encourage dedication. Currently, there is a strong trend of seeking personal gain, while dedication is mentioned less. In history, all countries that strive for strength have had periods of tightening their belts. From the ancient story of King Goujian of Yue to Japan's post-war recovery, it has always been the same. Our generation has encountered the era of reform, and encouraging dedication should become a consensus of the entire nation. The People's Political Consultative Conference should promote this idea."

　　改革的十年　光明的十年         
    ——魏明伦委员的见解
    本报记者  袁晞
    他的川剧别有风格，他的杂文自成一体，议政也独具见解。
    看他的议论：
    “现在社会上弊端不少，我认为主要问题不是改革引起的，不是改革本身的原因，而恰恰是对以前的一些弊病没改到、没改彻底。当然，表现形式有不同，比如过去是权侵一切，以权害人，现在是钱统一切，钱腐蚀人，侧重点从权转到钱了。这乍看是新弊端，实际是后遗症，根本不能归罪于改革。现在有人有思旧情绪是不对的，我认为改革的十年是光明的十年，是中国过去任何时代不能比拟的，三中全会救中国，我一直这么说。”
    “改革一方面要给人民带来实惠，一方面也要鼓励奉献，现在捞实惠风盛，奉献却提得少了。历史上所有国家在图强的过程中都有勒紧裤带的时候，从古代越王勾践十年生聚到战后日本恢复时期莫不如此。我们这代人碰上了改革的时代，鼓励奉献应成为全民族的共识，人民政协应促成这种观念。”
