The Jinan Military Region's certain anti-aircraft artillery brigade recently held an awards ceremony to honor soldier Tao Yuan for his honesty in returning lost property. When the brigade leaders pinned a gleaming third-class merit medal on Tao Yuan's chest, this humble young man burst into tears and said, "Thank you, leaders, for clearing my name. Otherwise, how could I face the world?"

Last December 5th, Tao Yuan found a handbag containing a 130,000 yuan cashier's check and 90 yuan in cash while returning to his unit. Based on the work ID left in the handbag by the owner, he walked two kilometers to find the owner—a businessperson from the Shangqiu City Textile Export Company in Henan Province. On January 1st of this year, Tao Yuan took leave and found a large package containing 16 kilograms of rabbit fur on his way back to the unit. He stood in the cold wind for nearly an hour, waiting for the owner to come back.

The two owners expressed their gratitude to the unit, and the leadership learned about Tao Yuan's two instances of honesty. After discussion, they decided to award him a merit. At this time, rumors spread within the camp. Some said these two incidents were staged by Tao Yuan to gain merit, otherwise how could they be so coincidental? Others said his motives were impure, aiming to gain political capital, otherwise why would he push away such a windfall? Some people who did not know the truth looked at Tao Yuan with disdain. The honest Tao Yuan felt wronged and often shed tears in secret.

Facing this situation, the unit sent people to investigate and verify the details of Tao Yuan's two instances of returning lost property, proving that Tao Yuan is a noble soldier who returns lost property honestly. While awarding Tao Yuan a merit, the unit's party committee severely criticized the erroneous behavior of a few people who envied good deeds. This incident caused a strong reaction within the unit.

　　战士陶元拾金不昧反受讥讽  部队领导批评歪风伸张正气
    新华社济南３月９日电  （通讯员逢高、记者蒋永武）济南军区某高炮旅最近召开表彰大会，为拾金不昧的战士陶元记功。当旅领导将一枚金灿灿的三等功勋章挂在陶元胸前时，这位憨厚的小伙子竟当众哭泣说：“多亏领导为我正了名，要不我今后咋做人啊！”
    去年１２月５日上午，陶元在外出归队途中拾到一个内装１３万元现金支票和９０元现款的手提包。他根据失主遗留在手提包里的工作证，徒步两公里找到了失主——河南省商丘市纺织品外贸公司的一位业务员。今年元月１日晚，陶元请假外出，归队路上又捡到一个大包，内装兔毛１６公斤，他立在寒风中等了近一小时，终于等来了失主。
    两位失主先后向部队致谢，领导才知道了陶元两次拾物不昧的情况，经研究准备为他记功。这时，营区里传出许多风言风语。有人说这两件事是陶元为了立功，同失主串通一气干的，要不咋能这么巧？还有人说他“动机不纯”，是为了捞政治资本，不然咋肯把天赐财富往外推？一些不明真相的人向陶元投去鄙视的目光。老实的陶元委屈得时常偷偷掉泪。
    面对这种情况，部队派人对陶元两次拾物的始末进行了详细调查核实，证明陶元是位拾金不昧的高尚战士。部队党委在为陶元记功的同时，严肃批评了少数人妒嫉好人好事的错误行为。此事在部队引起强烈反响。
