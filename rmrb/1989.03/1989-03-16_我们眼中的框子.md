	The Frames in Our Eyes
	By Jia Fuhai

	In recent years, there have been many articles discussing various types of eyes, such as red eyes, opportunistic eyes, and leftist eyes. Here, I will also contribute an article on the subject to join the discussion.

	There is a historical anecdote about two people from the state of Wu evaluating the appearance of the King of Wu. One said he was handsome, the other said he was ugly, and neither could convince the other. The historian commented: "The king has a fixed form, but the two people's observations had their merits and demerits... their eyes were different."

	This "difference" refers to the fact that each person's eyes have their own fixed frames. These frames are obviously not objective standards for evaluating things but are highly subjective judgments. When they use their different frames to observe the same object, their conclusions naturally differ.

	If we think carefully, don't we all have such frames in our eyes? Some leaders have their frames: obedient, gentle, and compliant subordinates who strictly follow their orders are considered good. Some people have their frames: a leader's behavior, speech, even a smile or frown, and their attire and hairstyle must meet certain standards to be considered good. Customers have their frames: a smiling face, smooth-talking, attentive service, and going the extra mile are considered good service. Shopkeepers have their frames: customers who are picky, nitpicking, and calculating are considered good customers. The list goes on. A young manager at a certain company, due to business relations, took a few more taxis, stayed in a few high-end hotels, and paid attention to his attire and hairstyle. As a result, the employees started gossiping: "He has changed, he's not like he used to be!" "So young, and he has already learned that trick!" Under the pressure of public opinion, this manager had to "return to simplicity"...

	It is clear that the rigid frames in our eyes can fix people and things in place, like certain scenes in movies and TV shows that are "frozen" in a single frame. Thus, the rich and diverse people and events in a dynamic society are constrained by these big and small frames. It is this "soft constraint" that makes social reforms difficult and brings endless disputes, friction, contradictions, and even conflicts in social and economic life. People on one hand hope for reformers to emerge, but when reformers slightly transcend themselves and break through the frames in everyone's eyes, more frames immediately come to restrain them and make them conform. Such social phenomena are countless. We often say that we need to create a good social and mental environment for reformers and reform, which requires us to bravely transcend the fixed frames in our own eyes and get closer to objective standards.

	It is said that some professors at certain universities, in their spare time, run technical markets and serve as enterprise consultants. Thus, the "problem" was reported: "Does this still look like a professor?" The supervising leader heard this and laughed heartily, countering: "In your opinion, what should a professor look like?" If everyone had such a frame-less perspective, then many of our problems would be much easier to solve.

### 我们眼中的框子

　　我们眼中的框子
    贾福海
    这几年说眼的文章渐多，如红眼、势利眼、左视眼，多有论及。这里也来一篇眼论凑个热闹。
    有个典故说吴国两个人评论吴王丑美。一人曰美，一人曰丑，各执一端，莫衷一是。史家批曰：“王有定形，二人察之有得失……眼睛异耳。”
    这个“异耳”，是说二人各自眼睛都是一个固有的框子。这个框子显然不是检验事物的客观标准，而是带有极大的主观臆断成份。他们带着各自的不同框子去审视对象，结论当然不一致。
    仔细想想，你、我、他的眼中，又何尝没有这样的框子？某些领导者的眼有框子：老实听话，温良顺从，不折不扣地执行自己的旨意，才是好的属下。某些群众的眼也有框子：举止言行，乃至一笑、一颦，服饰发型，须符合某个标准，才是好的领导者。顾客有顾客的框子：一副笑脸，八面玲珑，对我殷勤备至，服务到家，才是好的店家。店家有店家的框子：不嫌这嫌那，挑三拣四，斤斤计较，才是好的顾客。不一而足。某公司一位年轻经理，因应酬关系，多坐了几回出租汽车，出入了几次高级宾馆，讲究了一下服饰发型，于是职工中议论纷起：“他变了，不像原来那样了！”“年轻轻的，就学会了那一套！”迫于舆论压力，这位经理不得不又“返朴归真”……
    足见，我们眼中刻板的框子，实在可以把人把事看死了，像影视中某些画面那样被一成不变地“定格”了。于是动态社会中丰富多采的人和事，被这些大大小小的框子框死。正是这种“软约束”的作用，使得社会变革步履维艰，并且由此带来社会和经济生活中无穷的扯皮、摩擦、牴牾甚至冲撞。人们一面希冀改革者大批涌现出来，而当改革者稍稍超越自我，突破众人眼中的框子，马上便有更多的框子来束缚他，使其就范。这种社会现象举不胜举。我们常说，要为改革和改革者创造良好的社会环境和协同的心态环境，这就需要我们大家勇敢地超越自己眼中固有的框子，更贴近于客观的标准。
    据说，有些大学的一些教授，业余时间既跑技术市场，又当企业顾问，于是“问题”反映到上面：“这还像教授的样子吗？”主管领导闻之却哈哈大笑，反诘：“依你看教授该是个什么样子？”倘若大家都有这样一种不带框子的眼光，那么我们的许多事情也就好办多了。
