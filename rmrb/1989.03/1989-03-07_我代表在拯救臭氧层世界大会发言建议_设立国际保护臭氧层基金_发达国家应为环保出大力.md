China's representative at the Global Ozone Layer Protection Conference suggests setting up an international fund for ozone layer protection. Developed countries should contribute more to environmental protection.

BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The head of the Chinese delegation, Vice Chairman of the State Council's Environmental Protection Commission Liu Mingpu, proposed at the Global Ozone Layer Protection Conference held here on March 6 that an international fund for ozone layer protection be established. He hoped that developed countries would provide free technology transfers for alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and prioritize support for developing countries.

Liu Mingpu said, "China has already included environmental protection and family planning in its basic national policies. Work in environmental protection and natural resource conservation has been listed as an important agenda item for the country. However, China's environmental pollution and ecological destruction problems are still very serious, and their improvement will be a long-term and arduous task. The Chinese government will make long-term, unremitting efforts in this regard."

Liu Mingpu said, "Over the past century, global industrial production has increased by more than 50 times, with 80% of this growth occurring after 1950. The growth of the world economy relies on the development of productive forces and scientific and technological progress, as well as the support of environmental resources. Developed countries, which account for 1/4 of the world's population, consume 80% of the world's resources, producing some global environmental problems with large impacts and serious harm."

He said, "We believe that environmental issues are borderless. International cooperation in environmental science and technology exchange and assistance is very necessary for solving environmental problems. We also believe that, from a global perspective, developed countries should exert more effort in terms of funds and technology to solve global environmental problems and have the responsibility to assist developing countries in improving their own and the global environment."

　　我代表在拯救臭氧层世界大会发言建议
    设立国际保护臭氧层基金
    发达国家应为环保出大力
    本报伦敦３月６日电  记者陈特安报道：中国代表团团长、国务院环境保护委员会副主任刘明璞６日上午在这里举行的拯救臭氧层世界大会上，建议设立国际保护臭氧层基金，希望无偿转让氯氟烃的替代技术，优先支持发展中国家。
    刘明璞说：“中国已经把保护环境和计划生育列入了本国基本国策。在环境保护和自然资源保护方面的工作，已列入国家的重要议事日程。但是，中国的环境污染和生态破坏问题还很严重，它的改善将是长期和艰巨的任务。中国政府将在这方面作出长期不懈的积极努力。”
    刘明璞说，“近百年来全球工业生产增加了５０倍以上，其中８０％的增长是１９５０年以后发生的，世界经济的增长是依赖于生产力的发展和科学技术的进步，也依赖于环境资源的支撑，占世界人口１／４的发达国家消耗了世界资源的８０％，产生了一些影响范围大和危害严重的全球性的环境问题。
    他说：“我们认为环境问题是没有国界的，国际间环境科学技术交流合作援助对于解决环境问题是非常必要的。我们还认为，站在全球的高度上，发达国家应该为解决全球环境问题在资金、技术方面付出更大的力量，也有责任援助发展中国家，为改善本国和全球的环境作出应有的努力。
