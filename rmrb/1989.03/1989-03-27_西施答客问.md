	Xishi Answers a Reporter's Questions

	Last year, calendars and magazine covers all featured beautiful women as a trend. A reporter went to the ethereal streets of the nonexistent city to chat with the most beautiful woman in the world, Xishi. Unfortunately, Xishi was ill.

	Reporter: May I ask, madam, wasn't the illness of your heart and furrowed brows cured abroad long ago? Why are you holding your heart and frowning today?

	Xishi: They say, "Every festival brings thoughts of home." I, Xishi, am truly pitiful! First, I was offered by the Yue people to King Fuchai of Wu. Later, I followed Fan Li to roam the Five Lakes. Now, I am homeless! For these past few years, two counties have been arguing over who has the right to claim me as their native. They either hold academic discussions, issue news, develop tourism routes, or rebuild temples. Various disputes are in full swing. In these two places, everywhere you look, there are "Xishi Hotels," "Xishi Salons," "Xishi Bathhouses," "Xishi Shopping Malls." Train stations have my statues, and some small stations even want to rename themselves "Xishi Station." Look at me now! Moreover, I hear that there are others like me who have had similar experiences. It is said that the writer of "Water Margin," Mr. Shi,—of course, he is afraid of my forty-something generation grandson—is also being disputed by two places!

	Reporter: You both share the same misfortune.

	Xishi: I don't mind much. It's just that the famous people of my hometown are truly pitiful. In the past, to fill King Fuchai's desires, they sent me, a weak woman, to face danger. Now, to raise the profile of their hometown, they use me as a signboard. Why do these people always focus on us famous women? Even if it is glorious, what does it have to do with the present? Why are they obsessed with ancestor worship and not create new glory for their hometown with their own efforts?

　　西施答客问
    年前的挂历啦、杂志的封面啦，都以大美人儿为时髦，记者便到那虚无市缥缈街找那天下第一美人西施姑娘聊聊。不料西施姑娘病了。
    记者：敢问姑娘病心而颦之疾不是早已出洋治愈，今日何以又捧心皱眉？
    西施：人道是“每逢佳节倍思亲”，我西施想来好可怜见啊！我先被越人进献于吴王夫差，后来又归范蠡从游五湖，如今却是有家难归了！两个县市之间这几年一直在你争我夺，都说是我的故里。他们或则学术讨论，或则发布新闻，或则开辟旅游线路，或则重修殿宇，各种争执活动方兴未艾。在这两地，到处是什么“西施旅社”、“西施发廊”、“西施浴室”、“西施商场”，火车站树了我的塑像，有的小站还要更名为“西施站”。你看我成了什么了？况且像我这种遭遇的听说也远不止我一个。据说那位写水泊梁山的施先生，——当然，他怕的是我的四十几代孙了——也是两个地方争呢！
    记者：你们可是同病相怜啊。
    西施：我倒没什么。只是现在的名流乡亲实在可怜。当年要填吴王的欲壑，他们拿我这个弱不禁风的女子去赴汤蹈火；而今要提高家乡的知名度，又来拿我去做招牌。这些人眼光总是盯着我们这些女名人干什么？就算光荣，又与今人何干？为什么总是迷恋于祖宗崇拜，而不凭自己的创造去给家乡增添新的光彩？
