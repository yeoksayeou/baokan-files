The play "Social Image" tells the story of a rigid, affected old maid and a charming young man who have a brief romantic encounter:

Evelyn is a private tutor who teaches at home. She is concerned with, protects, and takes pride in her "social image." Her life is built on external appearances, but behind her good "social image" lies a lonely, empty, and hungry soul.

Rene is a former fashion model who has fallen from stardom to becoming an employee of an escort service, as he puts it, a "flattened frog." He sees poetry as nothing more than a high-level deception and believes that chaotic, fragmented prose is the true state of human existence. He mocks society, others, and himself, loudly voicing the resentment and hatred hidden in people's hearts.

The play tells the audience that a person's "social image" is a shackle on a fragile life. It conceals a person's true self, suppresses life's desires, and turns people into shallow, conformist products of social customs. The most meaningful work for a person is to create a new life according to their own choices. Whether one successfully removes the mask of "social image" or puts on a new one is irrelevant. What matters is breaking through the rigid shell of the old self and activating the locked-up life force.

This is a story told by the older generation of Mexican playwright Pablo Sabastian Beres in the 1950s. It is simple and straightforward, touching on themes that philosophers and artists have discussed for ages. However, because it speaks of a fate that people find hard to escape and a predicament that everyone must face; and because it is narrated in a suspenseful, delayed, abrupt, and thoroughly dramatic manner, it can hold the audience's attention for nearly two hours, making your heart race... You are finally enveloped by a unique, mysterious theatrical atmosphere. You will feel that what is being performed on stage is actually a drama you have enacted countless times on the public stage and the hidden stage of your heart. People play themselves on two stages, and the actors are merely your stand-ins.

This is the third play performed by the China Youth Art Theatre in a small theater. Director Wang Pei uses delicate and subtle artistic techniques to clearly reveal the inner turmoil and complex emotions that drive the male and female protagonists to react and act. Actions and counteractions, dialogue and subtext, are distinct yet focused, full of life and rhythm, and even in pauses, they are filled with dramatic tension.

　　人在两座舞台上扮演自己
    ——在小剧场看《社会形象》
    牛耕云
    话剧《社会形象》叙述的是一个古板、造作的老姑娘与一个逢场作戏的英俊小伙子一夕风流的故事：
    老姑娘埃维丽亚是个在家授课的私人教师。她所关注的、维护的、自傲的是自己的“社会形象”，生命全靠外在的东西堆砌而成，但在良好的“社会形象”后面却深藏着孤寂、空虚、饥渴的灵魂。
    小伙子雷内是个过气的时装模特，从红极一时的明星跌落到出卖肉体的“伴侣公司”的雇员，用他自己的话说，是只“压扁了的青蛙”。他看穿诗歌只不过是欺诳众生的高级虚伪，紊乱、破碎的散文才是人类生存的真实状况。他嘲弄社会，嘲弄他人，也嘲弄自己，把隐匿在人们心底的愤懑、怨恨大声呼喊出来。
    剧作告诉观众，人的“社会形象”其实是套在脆弱生命上的枷锁，它掩盖人的内在真实，压抑人的生命欲望，使人成为浅薄的社会习俗毫无个性的平庸制品。人最有意义的工作，莫过于按照自己的选择去创建新的生活，至于究竟是成功地卸下“社会形象”的假面，还是换上新的面具，那无关紧要，重要的是突破旧我坚硬的躯壳，使锁闭着的生命力激活起来。
    这是墨西哥老一代剧作家巴勃罗·萨胜那斯·贝雷斯在五十年代所讲述的故事。它平淡浅近，所揭示的也是哲学家们、艺术家们谈老了的话题。但由于它诉说了人所难以摆脱的命运，关涉任何人都必须面对的生存困境；更由于它是以一种充满悬念、延宕、陡转、十足戏剧化的方式叙述的，所以能在近两小时的演出中紧紧抓住观众的注意力，使你怦然心跳……你终于被一种独特的、神秘的戏剧氛围所笼罩，你会感到舞台所表演的，其实是你在公众的舞台与隐秘的内心舞台已扮演过无数次的活剧。人在两座舞台上扮演着自己，演员只不过是你的替身而已。
    这是中国青年艺术剧院在小剧场上演的第三出戏。导演王培以细腻、精微的艺术手法，明晰地揭示了促使男女主人公作出反应、采取行动的内在骚动与复杂情感。动作与反动作、台词与潜台词，层次分明又重点突出，生气流荡又张弛有致，即便在顿歇时也充盈着戏剧的张力。
