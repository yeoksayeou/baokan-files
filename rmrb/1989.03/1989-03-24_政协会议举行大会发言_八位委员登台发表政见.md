Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 23rd.

Eight delegates took the stage at the Great Hall of the People to express their views on national affairs during the plenary speeches at the seventh session of the seventh Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) this afternoon.

Li Xiannian, Chairman of the CPPCC, and other vice-chairpersons and standing committee members attended the meeting and listened attentively to the speeches.

It is reported that the seventh session of the seventh CPPCC will hold four plenary speeches. Each delegate's speech will not exceed 15 minutes to allow more delegates to speak.

Wan Guoquan, Vice-Chairman of the China Democratic League, was the first to speak. He represented the China Democratic League in proposing to adhere to, improve, enrich, and develop the multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party. He emphasized that the premise is adherence. He said that the argument that the leadership of the Communist Party makes multi-party cooperation redundant, and that China should follow capitalist countries in having opposition parties and rotating governments, does not conform to China's national conditions.

"Revitalizing education is urgent," was the appeal made by Vice-Chairman Qian Weichang on behalf of the China Democratic League. He proposed to comprehensively deepen the reform of the educational system, streamline the educational mechanism; and to mobilize social forces to run schools and encourage the whole nation to promote education.

Pabala Gelengdianjie, Vice-Chairman, spoke on the topic "History Cannot Be Reversed, Turmoil Is Unpopular." He said that Tibet will forever be Tibet of the People's Republic of China, and forever be Tibet of the Tibetan people. Any attempt to internationalize the Tibet issue, and any evil act against the historical trend, will inevitably be in vain and will not succeed.

Today, delegates Lu Yuanzhen, Gu Daichun (on behalf of Kang Yonghe and Chen Yu), Bi Kejuan, Wu Fuheng, and Lu Jingyun spoke on issues such as deepening enterprise reforms, boosting morale, combating corruption, and implementing compulsory education.

The presiding chairpersons of today's meeting were: Yan Mingfu, Kang Keqing, Pabala Gelengdianjie, Qu Wu, Sun Xiaocun, and Su Buqing.

　　政协会议举行大会发言          
    八位委员登台发表政见
    据新华社北京３月２３日电  （记者邹爱国、池茂花）全国政协七届二次会议今天下午开始大会发言。在今天的大会上，８位委员先后登上人民大会堂的讲台，就国家大事发表意见。
    李先念主席和各位副主席、常委出席大会，认真听取发言。
    据介绍，全国政协七届二次会议将举行四次大会发言，每个委员的发言不得超过１５分钟，以便有更多的委员能登台发表意见。
    民建中央副主席万国权委员第一个发言。他代表民建中央提出，坚持、完善、丰富、发展共产党领导的多党合作，前提是坚持。他说，那种有共产党的领导，多党合作就是多余的和中国应当像资本主义国家那样搞反对党、搞轮流执政的论调，都不符合中国国情。
    “振兴教育，刻不容缓”，是钱伟长副主席代表民盟中央在发言中发出的呼吁。他提出，要全面深化教育体制改革，理顺教育机制；大力发动社会力量办学，动员全民兴办教育。
    帕巴拉·格列朗杰副主席以《历史不容倒转，骚乱不得人心》为题发言。他说，西藏永远是中华人民共和国的西藏，永远是西藏人民的西藏，任何使西藏问题国际化的企图，任何逆历史潮流而动的罪恶行径，都必然是徒劳的，是决不会得逞的。
    在今天的大会上，罗元铮、顾大椿（代表康永和、陈宇）、毕克官、吴富恒、陆景云委员先后就深化企业改革，振奋精神、整顿腐败现象，实施义务教育等问题，发表了意见。今天大会的执行主席是：阎明复、康克清、帕巴拉·格列朗杰、屈武、孙晓村、苏步青。
