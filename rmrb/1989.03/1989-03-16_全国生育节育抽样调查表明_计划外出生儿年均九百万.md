Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 15th.

A nationwide fertility and contraception sampling survey shows that there are an average of 9 million unplanned births annually.

The results of the survey, which covered 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities (excluding Taiwan), and included 67 items, indicate that while significant progress has been made in family planning since the 1980s, there is still a gap between local efforts and central government requirements. The average total fertility rate from 1980 to 1987 was 2.47. If the current family planning policies set by the central government were fully implemented in rural areas, the total fertility rate should not exceed 2. Since the 1980s, an average of 9 million unplanned births occur annually on the Chinese mainland. Among these, unplanned second and multiple births each account for approximately 2/5, and early births (before age 20) account for about 1/5.

The average age of the surveyed population is 28.6 years, with a median age of 23.5 years, and a dependency ratio of 50.1%. The age structure of China's population is beginning to shift towards a more mature demographic.

In 1987, the birth rate of the surveyed population was 23.29‰, the death rate was 7.23‰, and the natural growth rate was 16.06‰. In the first half of 1988, the average number of births per 1,000 people was 9.03, deaths were 3.52, and the natural growth rate was 5.51. In 1987, the province with the highest birth rate had a rate of 28.06‰, while the lowest was 14.72‰. Among these, the birth rates in Hebei, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Xinjiang were all above 25‰.

The contraceptive rate among married women of childbearing age in the surveyed population was 71.21%. Nationwide, there are 56 million married women of childbearing age who have not taken any contraceptive measures.

　　全国生育节育抽样调查表明
    计划外出生儿年均九百万
    本报北京３月１５日讯  记者艾笑报道：《全国生育节育抽样调查公报》今天在北京公布。
    这次覆盖了全国除台湾省外３０个省区市范围、内容包括６７个项目的调查结果使人们看到，尽管８０年代以来，各地计划生育工作取得了不小成绩，但同中央的要求还有距离。全国１９８０至１９８７年平均总和生育率为２．４７，如果中央制定的计划生育现行政策在广大农村都能真正得到落实，总和生育率不应超过２。８０年代以来，中国大陆上平均每年都有９００万计划外出生的婴儿，其中计划外二孩和多孩各约占２／５，２０岁以前早育的一孩约占１／５。
    调查样本人口平均年龄为２８．６岁，年龄中位数２３．５岁，抚养系数为５０．１％。我国人口年龄构成开始进入成年型。
    １９８７年样本人口出生率为２３．２９‰，死亡率为７．２３‰，自然增长率为１６．０６‰；１９８８年上半年平均每１０００人口中出生９．０３人，死亡３．５２人，自然增长５．５１人。１９８７年出生率最高的省达２８．０６‰，最低的为１４．７２‰。其中，河北、江西、河南、湖北、湖南、广西、贵州、云南、西藏、陕西、宁夏、新疆等地的出生率都在２５‰以上。
    调查样本已婚育龄妇女的节育率为７１．２１％。全国已婚有配偶育龄妇女未采取任何避孕措施的有５６００万。
