Wan Li, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, spoke at the conclusion of the seventh session of the Standing Committee. He hoped that the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress would fully uphold democracy, encourage open discussion, and allow representatives to collectively brainstorm, share ideas, and pool their wisdom. The meeting should be a conference that boosts morale, enhances confidence, and promotes the rectification and deepening of reforms.

Wan Li said that both internationally and domestically, there is significant attention on the convening of the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress. This is because China's rectification and deepening of reforms have reached a critical juncture. China's reforms have achieved globally recognized successes, but they also face some difficulties and problems. Since the implementation of the policies outlined in the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, initial successes have been achieved, but there are also issues that need further study and resolution. Currently, the people are highly concerned about issues such as inflation, price increases, unfair distribution, corruption, as well as problems in agriculture, education, and the treatment of intellectuals. The people's concerns are justified. To address the economic environment and rectify economic order, we must balance stability, reform, and development. Achieving this requires the united efforts of all ethnic groups in China to overcome difficulties and ensure the success of construction and reform.

He said that the nearly 3,000 representatives of the National People's Congress are directly involved in the rectification work in various regions and sectors across the country. They have rich practical experience, maintain close ties with the broad masses of the people, and understand the people's wishes and demands. Therefore, the conference must fully uphold democracy, encourage open discussion, and allow representatives to collectively brainstorm, share ideas, and pool their wisdom. The meeting should be a conference that boosts morale, enhances confidence, and promotes the rectification and deepening of reforms.

Wan Li pointed out that to smoothly carry out the rectification, further improve construction and reform, and open up, a stable environment is needed. Currently, the world is transitioning from confrontation to dialogue, from tension to relaxation, and it is possible to secure a relatively long period of international peace. A stable domestic environment is also crucial. Without stability, nothing can be accomplished; not only will construction and reform be impossible, but even the achievements already made will be lost. The profound lessons of the "Cultural Revolution" and the chaos of a nationwide civil war are still fresh in the minds of the Chinese people, and such chaos must not be allowed to happen again. Recently, a few separatist elements have been causing unrest in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, seriously endangering social stability. The State Council, in accordance with the Constitution, has imposed martial law in Lhasa to maintain social order, ensure the safety of citizens' lives and property, and protect public property from being damaged. This is completely necessary and has the support of all ethnic groups in China, including the Tibetan people. In our country and society, the factors and forces for stability are absolutely dominant. However, destabilizing factors and forces do exist. Therefore, we must adhere to the four cardinal principles, persist in reform and opening up, and maintain a stable, united, democratic, and harmonious political situation. Emphasizing stability does not mean abandoning reform and opening up or not developing democracy. On the contrary, it is precisely to proceed from China's actual situation, carry out democratic political construction, improve the scientific and democratic nature of decision-making, and create favorable conditions for reform and opening up.

He said that an important aspect of maintaining national stability is to strengthen legal construction. This is not only necessary for establishing a new socialist commodity economic order but also a powerful means to ensure social stability. Existing laws must be strictly enforced. Legislative work must be strengthened, and urgent laws must be promptly drafted. Over the past year, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has enacted thirteen laws and legal decisions, and has also formulated a five-year legislative plan and preliminary arrangements for expediting legislation in the next two years. In addition to focusing on drafting laws related to rectification and deepening reforms, laws such as the Press Law, Publication Law, Assembly, Procession, and Demonstration Law, and the Association Law, which safeguard citizens' rights and maintain social public order, must be expedited. This is an important task for the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and it must be earnestly and promptly carried out.

### 万里在全国人大常委会上强调  人大二次会要开成增强信心的会

　　万里在全国人大常委会上强调
    人大二次会要开成增强信心的会
    新华社北京３月１１日电  全国人大常委会委员长万里在今天结束的七届全国人大常委会第七次会议上讲话中希望：七届全国人大二次会议一定要充分发扬民主，畅所欲言，代表们共同出主意，想办法，集思广益，把会议开成一个振奋精神，增强信心的大会，推动治理整顿，深化改革的大会。
    万里说，当前国际国内对七届全国人大二次会议的召开都很关注。这是因为我国的治理整顿、深化改革工作正进入一个关键时刻。我国的改革取得了举世公认的成就，在前进中也面临一些困难和问题。贯彻党的十三届三中全会治理整顿、深化改革的方针以来，已经取得了初步成效，同时也存在着一些问题需要进一步研究解决。当前人民对通货膨胀，物价上涨，分配不公，腐败现象以及农业、教育和知识分子待遇等问题，都十分关心。人民群众的关心是有道理的。解决好治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，必须把稳定、改革和发展统一起来，而做到这一点，只有动员全国各族人民同心同德，群策群力，才能克服困难，使建设和改革取得进一步的成功。
    他说，全国人民代表大会的近３０００名代表，在全国各地区、各条战线直接参加治理整顿工作，了解情况，有丰富的实践经验，他们同广大人民群众有着密切的联系，了解人民群众的愿望和要求。为此，会议一定要充分发扬民主，畅所欲言，代表们共同出主意、想办法，集思广益，把会议开成一个振奋精神，增强信心的大会，推动治理整顿、深化改革的大会。
    万里指出，为了顺利进行治理整顿，进一步搞好建设和改革开放，需要一个稳定的环境。现在全世界由对抗转向对话，由紧张转向缓和，争取一个较长时期的国际和平环境是可能的。国内有一个稳定的环境也是十分重要的，没有稳定的环境什么也搞不成，不仅无法进行建设和改革，就是已经取得的成果也会丧失。“文化大革命”全面内战的深刻教训，全国人民记忆犹新，绝不允许类似的混乱局面重演。最近少数分裂主义分子不断在西藏自治区拉萨市制造骚乱，严重危害社会安定。国务院为了维护社会秩序，保障公民人身、财产的安全，保护公共财产不受侵犯，根据宪法规定，在拉萨市实行戒严，这是完全必要的，得到包括西藏人民在内的全国各族人民的拥护。在我们国家和社会中，稳定的因素，稳定的力量占绝对优势。但是不稳定的因素和力量也是存在的。因此，必须坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，维护安定、团结、民主、和谐的政治局面。强调稳定，绝不是放弃改革开放，不是不发展民主。相反，正是为了从我国实际情况出发，进行民主政治建设，提高决策的科学化、民主化的程度，为改革开放创造有利的条件。
    他说，保持国家稳定的一个很重要的方面，就是要加强法制建设。这不仅是建立社会主义商品经济新秩序的需要，也是保障社会稳定的有力手段。对已经颁布的法律，要认真实施。要进一步加强立法工作，对急需的法律要抓紧制定。一年来，人大常委会制定了十三个法律和法律性决定，同时还制定了５年立法规划和今明两年加快立法的初步安排意见。除了重点抓紧制定与治理整顿、深化改革有关的法律外，还要加快制定新闻法、出版法、集会游行示威法、社团法等保障公民权利和维护社会公共秩序方面的法律。这是人大常委会的重要任务，要认真抓紧进行。
