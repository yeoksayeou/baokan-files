Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 6th. Reporter Pan Gang reports: Vice Minister of the Ministry of Commerce Pan Yao said today that the two-month implementation of the specialized management of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films has shown initial effectiveness. The main indicators are that the chaotic situation of multiple entities interfering with the management of agricultural production materials has been basically reversed, and the situation of fake fertilizers and fake pesticides entering the market has been initially controlled. The market prices of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films are relatively stable compared to last year. The comprehensive price of large-scale fertilizers and the price of small-scale fertilizers have risen, but the increase is lower than last year. In terms of supply, "transparency" has also improved.

Pan Yao said that the specialized management has quickly achieved initial results, but there are still many problems. Our attitude towards these problems is clear: we will investigate and handle each case as it is discovered, and we will not be lenient or indulgent. He welcomed the media's exposure of issues related to the violation of supply policies by agricultural production material management units and stated, "For each issue exposed by the media, the relevant agricultural production material management departments at all levels must investigate and handle it without protecting their own interests. For serious cases that violate the law, they should be handed over to the relevant departments for legal processing."

　　农资专营实行两月
    初见成效问题不少
    商业部表示：支持新闻单位揭短
    本报北京３月６日讯  记者潘岗报道：商业部副部长潘遥今天在此间说，实施两个月的化肥、农药、农膜专营工作初见成效。主要标志是农业生产资料多头插手经营混乱局面基本扭转，假肥、假药流入市场的情况初步得到控制；化肥、农药、农膜的市场价格水平比去年平稳，大化肥综合价和小化肥价格有所上升，但上升幅度低于去年。在供应上，“透明度”也有提高。
    潘遥说，专营较快地取得初步成效，但存在的问题也不少。对这类问题，我们的态度是明确的，发现一件，查处一件，绝不迁就姑息。他对新闻单位揭露农业生产资料经营单位违反供应政策的问题表示欢迎，并称，“对各新闻单位揭露的问题，各级农业生产资料主管部门要发现一件，查处一件，不护短。对情节严重、触犯刑律的，要提请有关部门依法处理。”
