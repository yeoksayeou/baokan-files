During a conversation with Mr. Gao, he mentioned the words "photo album." Mr. Gao's son, Gao Zhiqi, immediately understood and fetched the family photo album for me to browse. Suddenly, we discovered a photograph of him and my father, Fei Qihe, on a ship returning from the United States, taken on the deck. Sixty years had passed, but Mr. Gao still treasured and remembered it. What does this say about a brain severely damaged by a virus?

When I was facing numerous difficulties in my work to rescue delinquent youth, Mr. Gao Siyi, Mr. Sun Jingxiu, and Mr. Wu Yunduo stood up one after another and said to me, "You are doing the right thing, and we support you." They added, "Whichever school (referring to a vocational school) invites you to be the honorary principal, the three of us will serve as external advisors there." Few words, but deep affection...

Mr. Gao had difficulty speaking and articulating words, but when he sang, his enthusiasm was undiminished. I remember one time at a gathering at my home, we were discussing new approaches to the "comprehensive treatment" of delinquent youth. The entertainment that followed was a cultural performance. Mr. Gao and I performed a duet in English, singing one song after another, seemingly unable to stop. Even my Persian cat, who had never seen such a scene, wagged its tail in "welcome."

When Mr. Gao was excited, he had a unique way of expressing himself. He moved with difficulty, but whenever I visited, he would always walk a few steps to show me, and then lean against the wall to do some exercises. Sometimes, he would even play with a balloon with me. The balloon would float around, and Mr. Gao would laugh with delight, laughing like a child, pure and innocent.

Mr. Gao has left us forever, but his words of encouragement will always be unforgettable. In my autograph book, he wrote: "You are a good mother to delinquent youth. This long journey must be continued. I wish you success." I will definitely take Mr. Gao's advice as my motto and do a good job in rescuing delinquent youth, to comfort Mr. Gao's spirit in heaven.

　　瞬间载着隆重        
    ——和高士其接触中的几件小事
    费路路
    一次，同高老的谈话中，他吐出“照片本”三个字，高老的儿子高志奇会意，找出家庭相册和我一起翻阅，忽然发现其中有一张照片，是他同我父亲费起鹤同船从美国回来，在轮船上的合影。６０年过去了，高老还珍存着，记忆着。对于一只被病毒严重摧残过的大脑，这究竟说明了些什么？
    正当我从事挽救失足青少年工作遇到重重困难时，高士其、孙敬修、吴运铎三位老人，相继挺身而出，对我说，你做得对，我们支持你。哪个学校（指工读学校）请你做名誉校长，我们三人就在哪个学校任校外辅导员。话不多，而情义深沉……。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    高老说话吐字都困难，可是唱起歌来兴致不减当年。记得有一次在我家聚会，讨论对失足青少年“综合治理”的新路，余兴是文艺演出。高老和我用英语表演了二重唱，一首之后又接一首，大有欲罢不能之势。我家的波斯猫，也不曾见到过这架势，竟也摇着尾巴表示“欢迎”。
    高老兴奋时，有一套独特的表达方式。他行动艰难，有时我去了，他总要自己走几步路给我看，还要背靠墙做几下健身操。有时，还要和我托几下轻气球。气球飘来飘去，高老会发出得意的笑，笑得像小孩子一样，天真、纯朴。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    高老和我们永别了，但是高老的赠言，使我永怀难忘。他在我的留言簿中写着：“你是失足青少年的好妈妈，这长长的路要走下去，我祝你成功。”我一定把高老的叮嘱作为座右铭，把挽救失足青少年的工作做好，以慰高老在天之灵。
