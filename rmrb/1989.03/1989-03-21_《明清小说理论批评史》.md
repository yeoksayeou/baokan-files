Edition: 6

The novel creation of the Ming and Qing dynasties was a period of development, and the abundance of works nourished the blossoming of novel theory. Although individual essays occasionally appeared in periodicals, they were scattered and disjointed. "A History of Novel Theory and Criticism in the Ming and Qing Dynasties" fills this gap.

This book systematically discusses the historical and cultural backgrounds of novel theory and criticism during the Ming and Qing dynasties, as well as the major theoretical achievements and monographs. It covers novel genres such as chivalric and detective novels, satirical novels, and realistic novels. It also discusses theorists such as Yongquzi, Li Boyuan, Wu Jianren, Liu E, Yan Fu, Xia Zengyou, Liang Qichao, Wang Guowei, and dozens of others.
