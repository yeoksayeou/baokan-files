In the city of Zhangpu County in southern Fujian, there is a prefecture and county office building from the Tang Dynasty, approximately 1,300 years old. It is one of the rare well-preserved ancient government buildings in China today.

In the second year of the Zongzhang era of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty (669 AD), the Left Commander and General of the Returning Virtue, Chen Zheng, received an imperial decree to lead the Southern Expedition General and 3,600 soldiers to the area of Suian County (the predecessor of Zhangpu County), where they surveyed the mountains and rivers, and established settlements and fortresses. In the second year of the Yifeng era (677 AD), after Chen Zheng's death, his son Chen Yuan Guang, as the Left Commander, led the troops to settle north of the Zhang River. In the second year of the Shouzhi era (686 AD), he submitted a memorial (requesting the establishment of a prefecture and county), wishing to establish a prefecture and county in this area. After approval, the southwestern region of Fuzhou was divided to establish Zhangzhou Prefecture and Zhangpu County. At that time, the prefecture and county were both located under the deep mountains (today's border between Zhangpu County and Yunxiao County). In the fourth year of the Kaiyuan era of Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty (716 AD), the prefecture and county were moved to Li'ao River (today's Zhangpu County).

The original office building was a large hall with two side rooms, made of wood and earth, covering an area of more than 270 square meters. Although the building was not intricately carved or painted with colorful beams and pillars, it was simple and elegant, with a traditional national style.

Since the Tang Dynasty established the county, this ancient building—the Zhangzhou Prefecture Office—has undergone several renovations over the generations and has always been the county office until before and after liberation. In 1985, the relevant departments of Fujian Province allocated funds to repair and renovate it. It is now used as the county's historical relics exhibition hall.

　　唐代的漳州府衙
    何荣林
    在闽南的漳浦县城中，保存着一座约一千三百年前唐代建的州县府衙。它是现今我国罕见的保存完好的衙署古建筑之一。
    唐高宗总章二年（六六九年），左郎将归德将军陈政奉诏统领岭南行军总管、率三千六百名将士，到被称为七闽百粤交界的绥安县地（今漳浦县前身），相视山原水川、开屯建堡。仪凤二年（六七七年），陈政死后，其子陈元光为左郎将代父带兵，开屯在漳水之北，并于垂拱二年（六八六年）上疏（请建州县表），欲于此地建置州县。获准后，割福州的西南地区建漳州府和漳浦县。当时的州县址同在深山（今漳浦县与云霄县交界的大山）之下。唐玄宗开元四年（七一六年），州县迁至李澳川（今漳浦县城）。
    原衙署是一大厅两厢房的土木建筑，面积二百七十多平方米，建筑物虽没有精雕细刻、彩绘椽柱，但纯朴大方，古香古色，具有民族传统特色。
    自唐代建县以后，这座古建筑——漳州府衙，历经数代，均有维修，直至解放前后，始终为县衙所在地。一九八五年，福建省等有关部门拨款修葺一新，现已辟为该县历史文物陈列馆。
