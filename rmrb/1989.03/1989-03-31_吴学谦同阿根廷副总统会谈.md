Vice Premier Wu Xueqian held talks with Argentine Vice President and Senate President Victor Martinez this afternoon at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

Wu Xueqian said that China and Argentina have similar or identical stances on many major international issues and have cooperated well in international affairs. Relations between the two countries have developed rapidly in various fields.

Wu Xueqian noted that in recent years, the trade volume between China and Argentina has increased significantly. He expressed the hope that the Argentine government and businesspeople would consider increasing imports from China to ensure more balanced trade development between the two countries.

Martinez said that the Argentine government attaches great importance to developing relations with China. In recent years, many Argentine government officials and members of both houses of Congress, especially President Raul Alfonsin's visit to China last May, have demonstrated this commitment. He said that Argentina adheres to a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, respects the self-determination of peoples, and seeks solutions to some Latin American issues based on these principles.

Before the talks, Wu Xueqian hosted a luncheon for Martinez and his wife. During the conversation, Wu Xueqian explained China's principled stance on the Taiwan issue. Martinez expressed understanding and support for this position.

    据新华社北京３月３０日电  国务院副总理吴学谦今天下午在钓鱼台国宾馆同阿根廷副总统兼参议长维克托·马丁内斯举行了会谈。
    吴学谦说，中阿两国在许多重大国际问题上有着相同或相似的立场，在国际事务中进行了很好的配合和合作，两国关系在各个领域都取得了较快的发展。
    吴学谦说，近几年，中阿两国贸易额增加较快。他表示希望阿根廷政府和企业家能考虑增加从中国的进口，以便使两国的贸易更健康地发展。
    马丁内斯说，阿根廷政府高度重视发展同中国的关系，这些年众多的阿政府官员和参众两院议员，特别是阿方辛总统去年５月的访华，都表明了这一点。他说，阿根廷对外坚持奉行不干涉政策，尊重各国人民的自决权，并且根据这些原则寻求拉美一些问题的解决。
