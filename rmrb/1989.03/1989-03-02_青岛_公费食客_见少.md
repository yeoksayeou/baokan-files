The number of "publicly funded diners" frequenting various restaurants in Qingdao has noticeably decreased this year. According to the Qingdao City Catering Service Company, the number of such diners in the first two months of this year is at least 30% less than the same period last year.

The Huanghai Hotel, which serves as an internal banquet hall for the municipal party committee and government, used to have many visitors paying with checks. People from all over the country know that "the seafood is good in Qingdao," and many units in Qingdao are generous in their hospitality. Now, things have cooled down. According to the hotel's general manager, government departments rarely host banquets now, and leaders basically do not accompany guests for meals. The other day, relevant departments in Qingdao City, in preparation for the opening of the Shandong Province Foreign Trade Fair, arranged a cold buffet reception for over a thousand people, with a planned expenditure of 80,000 yuan. After learning about this, Provincial Committee Secretary Liang Buting and Qingdao City Committee Secretary Liu Peng suggested canceling the reception.

The standards for necessary publicly funded banquets have also been lowered. Manager Dong Zhong of Tianfu Restaurant said that previously, units coming to arrange meals would spend 400 to 500 yuan per table, with some spending over 1,000 yuan. Now, it is generally 200 yuan or less per table. Manager Sun Shide of the Beihai Hotel's catering department said that now, high-end liquors like Maotai, Wuliangye, Jiannanchun, and Quanjude, as well as canned beverages and high-end cigarettes, are really hard to sell.

    青岛“公费食客”见少
    据新华社青岛3月1日电  （记者杨凤山、刘海民）今年光顾青岛各饭店的“公费食客”明显减少了。据青岛市饮食服务公司估计，今年头两个月起码比去年同期少3成。
    黄海饭店是市委、市政府的“内部招待所”，以往拿支票来吃饭者不少。南来北往的客人都知“海鲜好，数青岛”，青岛的许多单位也乐而好施。如今这里冷淡多了。据黄海饭店的总经理讲，政府部门如今很少请客，领导基本上不陪吃。前几天，青岛市有关部门为准备山东省对外贸易洽谈会开幕，安排了一个上千人的冷餐招待会，计划花8万元。省顾委主任梁步庭和青岛市委书记刘鹏知道后建议把招待会取消。
    必要的公费宴请，标准也降低了。天府酒家经理董忠讲，以前来安排饭的单位，大都一桌掏四五百元，高的上千元。现在一般是一桌200元或更低。北海宾馆餐饮部经理孙世德说，现在茅台、五粮液、剑南春、全兴大曲等名酒和易拉罐饮料及高级香烟实在不好卖。
