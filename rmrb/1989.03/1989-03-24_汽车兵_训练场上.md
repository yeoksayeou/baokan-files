	On the training grounds of the Huaihai Motorized Vehicle Driver Training Base in Xuzhou, Major General Di Yuzeng invited me to observe. That day, a batch of trainees were undergoing their graduation assessment. Three red signal flares tore through the sky, and the roar of engines echoed from the parking lot behind the training building. In an instant, the ground was shrouded in dust, blotting out the sky. One hundred large trucks, one after another, set off. The leading truck hadn't gone far before it plunged into a deep pit, leaving only the top of the cab visible.

	As the following vehicles crossed the flooded road, the first truck had already passed over the elevated bridge. The bridge, about two meters high, had two steel rails as its surface. I said to Director Di, "In the 1960s, during the military's large-scale competitions, I saw vehicles driving on steel rails." Di Yuzeng, seemingly holding his breath, merely nodded his bearded chin towards the elevated bridge, indicating that I should pay close attention to the vehicles driving on the rails. This time, there were one hundred vehicles, and not a single one derailed. I couldn't help but admire their skill. The vehicles drove onto the ferry one by one, crossed the river, and then entered the tactical simulation road. The tactical simulation road consisted of various obstacles such as bomb craters, roadblocks, muddy surfaces, and surfaces resembling washboards. After navigating these roads, the convoy entered the mountainous area. The 22-kilometer mountainous road had various slopes, turns, and narrow paths. Along the cliff edges, some sections required the vehicles to reverse to pass through.

	Taking advantage of the convoy's departure into the mountains, I chatted with Di Yuzeng. I said, "You have great ambition. Your army group is willing to invest heavily!" The tall rear services director said, "Nowadays, the military's modernization level is high, and there are many motorized troops. In our army group, on average, one out of every six members is a vehicle driver. If they don't undergo rigorous training, the military will have difficulty moving, and accidents might occur. Therefore, we decided to invest some resources, build a decent training base, improve the skills of vehicle drivers, ensure they can drive in wartime, and reduce accidents in peacetime. This way, we can achieve both combat effectiveness and economic benefits. Why not do it?"

	As we spoke, the vast convoy returned, entering the simulated urban road. The leading vehicle was driving smoothly when suddenly, a child in colorful clothes dashed out from a house by the roadside and ran into the middle of the street. With a sharp screech, the vehicle came to an abrupt halt! At the same time, the child stopped in the middle of the road. As the vehicle prepared to continue, the child hesitated and ran back. "Ah!" I exclaimed in surprise. Di Yuzeng laughed and said, "That's a simulated pedestrian, fully automated, capable of running, walking slowly, falling, and hesitating."

	In the past, comprehensive skill assessments for vehicle drivers involved setting up many poles on the field for drivers to navigate through. This required eleven people to assist for each trainee. Today, at the Huaihai Motorized Vehicle Driver Training Base's comprehensive training field, there were also 32 poles, but the field was empty. A teacher sat in a classroom hundreds of meters away, watching the electronic computer terminal screen. As the trainee drove through the pole area, every movement was displayed on the teacher's screen. This is the only electronic computer in China currently used for comprehensive skill assessments of vehicle drivers. This training base can accommodate 700 trainees per session and can also provide short-term training and assessments for drivers of various vehicles, as well as training for vehicle management personnel, supervisors, and automotive repair technicians. Here, not only are military vehicle drivers trained, but the base has also undertaken the training of vehicle drivers from local units. There is a highly skilled team of instructors here, and drivers of all types of vehicles equipped by China can be trained here.

　　“汽车兵”训练场上
    本报记者  罗同松
    徐州，淮海汽车司机训练基地。
    佩戴陆军大校肩章的狄玉增邀我去参观。这天，正逢一批学员进行毕业考核。３发红色信号弹划破天空，只听马达声从教学大楼后边的停车场呼啸而来。顷刻，大地烟尘滚滚，遮天蔽日，１００台大卡车一辆接着一辆上路。走在最前面的那辆车行驶不远，便钻进了深坑，仅仅露出了车篷顶。
    后边的车辆相继通过涉水路时，第一辆车已从高架桥上通过去了。高架桥看上去有２米高，桥面是两根钢轨。我对狄部长说：“６０年代军队搞大比武我见过汽车走钢轨的场面。”狄玉增此时似在屏声息气，只是用带有胡茬子的下巴朝高架桥方向努了努，示意我认真看汽车走钢轨。这回可是１００辆车啊，一辆也不脱轨，我不禁暗暗叫绝。汽车依次开上渡船，渡过河对岸，便进入战术模拟路行驶。那战术模拟路，无非是弹坑呀，路障呀，泥泞路面呀，以及诸如搓衣板形状的路面等等。车队通过这些道路，便进入山区。２２公里长的山区道路，备有各种坡道、弯道和窄道。悬崖边有的路段，汽车要开倒车才能通过。
    趁汽车队远去山区的时机，我和狄玉增攀谈起来。我说：“有气魄。你们集团军舍得花血本！”高个子后勤部长说：“如今部队现代化程度高了，汽车兵多。我们集团军里，平均６个成员中有１个汽车司机。要是不经过严格训练，部队难以运动，搞不好还翻车撞人。所以我们决定，莫不如投点资，搞个象样的训练基地，提高汽车司机的素质，战时开得动，平时少闯祸，这就叫既出战斗力，又出经济效益，何乐而不为！”
    说话之间，那浩浩荡荡的车队绕回来，进入模拟市区道路行驶。第一辆车驶得正欢，突然，路旁一所房子里，窜出一个穿花衣服的“小孩”，奔跑到了马路当中。只听“嘎”地一声长嘶，汽车猛地刹住了！与此同时，“小孩”停在了马路当间。当汽车启动，准备从“孩子”身后继续前进时，谁知那“孩子”一阵犹豫之后，折转身子往回跑。“啊呀！”我不禁惊叫起来。狄玉增却笑着说：“那是模拟行人，全部电动，可以做出奔跑、慢行、摔倒、犹豫等动作。
    过去对汽车司机进行综合技能考核，场地上插有许多长竿，让司机开车在竿行中穿行。那样，考１个学员，得有１１个人伺候。今天，淮海汽车司机训练基地的综合训练场，也插着３２根长竿，但场地上空无１人。有位教员坐在几百米开外的教室里，看着电子计算机终端器的荧光屏。学员驾车通过插竿区，其一举一动，都在教员眼前的荧光屏上显示出来，这是我国目前唯一的一台用在汽车司机综合技能考核的电子计算机。这个汽车司机训练基地每期可以承训７００名学员，还可以对各种车辆司机进行短训和考核，对车管人员、监理人员以及汽车修理工进行培训；这里不但训练部队汽车兵，还已经承担了地方单位汽车司机培训任务。这里有一支水平很高的教员队伍，凡是我国装备了的汽车，其驾驶员都可以在这里进行训练。
