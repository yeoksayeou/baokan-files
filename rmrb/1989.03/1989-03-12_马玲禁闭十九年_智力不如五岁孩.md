Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, March 10th.

A worker named Ma Chao from the Nanjing Railway Bureau Construction Section, who suffers from typical obsessive-compulsive disorder, locked his daughter in the house for 19 years. Ma Chao married Huang, who had sequelae of meningitis, in his youth. In 1970, their eldest daughter, Ma Ling, was born. Fearing that the child would be bullied outside, Ma Chao locked his daughter in the house all day. Later, Ma Ling had a younger sister and a younger brother, and the three children lived in a damp and dark small room, where they ate, drank, excreted, and slept. On February 15 of this year, Ma Ling was finally released by her father.

According to the psychological education counseling center of Nanjing Normal University, the 19-year-old Ma Ling's intelligence is below that of a five-year-old child; the 15-year-old younger sister's intelligence is below that of a two-year-old child; and the 11-year-old younger brother's intelligence is comparable to that of a one-year-old infant. The judicial authorities believe that Ma Chao has infringed upon the legitimate rights of women and children.

　　马玲禁闭十九年  智力不如五岁孩
    据新华社南京三月十日电  南京铁路分局建筑段患有典型强迫症的工人马超，把女儿锁在家里十九年。他年轻时和患有脑膜炎后遗症的黄某结婚后，一九七○年大女儿马玲出生。他怕孩子在外边受欺，便把女儿整天锁在家里。后来，马玲又有了一个妹妹和一个弟弟，三个孩子同住一间潮湿阴暗的小屋，吃、喝、拉、睡都在里面。今年二月十五日，马玲才被父亲放出。
    据南京师范大学心理教育咨询中心测验，十九岁的马玲的智力不如五岁孩子；十五岁的妹妹智力低于两岁儿童；十一岁的弟弟智力跟一岁的婴儿差不多。司法机关认为马超侵犯了妇女儿童的合法权益。
