Substandard Schools to be Rectified: Nearly 200 Institutions Face Overhaul

	Substandard facilities and unguaranteed education quality have led to the decision to rectify nearly 200 ordinary colleges and universities. Xuzhou Teachers College and Nanjing Energy Engineering Institute have already been merged with other institutions.

	According to a report by Zhou Qing from the People's Daily, Beijing, March 8th, Xuzhou Teachers College has recently been merged with Xuzhou Teachers University, both of which were originally located on the same street in Xuzhou. Previously, Nanjing Energy Engineering Institute was approved by the State Education Commission to merge with Southeast University. The new campus of Southeast University is located in the Nanjing Industrial Science Park.

	This marks the beginning of the state's rectification of certain ordinary higher education institutions.

	The State Education Commission has proposed in a rectification plan that institutions that do not meet the standards set by the State Council's "Temporary Regulations on the Establishment of Ordinary Higher Education Institutions" will be given a three-year period to improve their leadership, faculty, land, buildings, libraries, equipment, and practice facilities. The focus of this rectification will be on the substandard institutions established in recent years. According to estimates from relevant departments, there are approximately 200 such institutions, which represent a small portion of the 1,075 ordinary higher education institutions in the country.

	Over the past decade, the number of ordinary higher education institutions in China has significantly increased. However, some newly established schools were rushed into operation without sufficient deliberation, leading to unreasonable layouts, repeated specializations, and low investment and social returns. Some of these schools have poor facilities and cannot guarantee teaching quality. Additionally, some schools aim too high and their names do not match their actual capabilities, causing a certain degree of chaos. Some older institutions, due to long-term overloading, have deteriorating teaching and living conditions, and their work is plagued by various contradictions arising from expansion, affecting internal management and the improvement of education quality. After rapid development, education needs a period of stability to digest, consolidate, and improve the achievements, otherwise, it will painfully retrace its steps. The decision to rectify a small number of substandard ordinary higher education institutions is made in this context.

	It is reported that after the completion of this rectification and improvement work, the State Education Commission will organize experts to conduct mutual inspections, acceptance, and evaluation. Based on this, the state will officially publish the list of ordinary higher education institutions nationwide according to the levels of the schools.

### 办学条件不合格　教育质量无保证  近二百所普通高校将整顿  徐州师专和南京能源工程学院已并入其他高校

　　办学条件不合格　教育质量无保证
    近二百所普通高校将整顿
    徐州师专和南京能源工程学院已并入其他高校
    本报北京３月８日讯  记者周庆报道：据国家教委有关方面负责人今天透露，徐州师范专科学校近日并入徐州师范学院，两校原本在徐州的同一条街上。此前，南京能源工程学院也已由国家教委批准并入东南大学。新的东南大学校址在南京工业科学园区域内。
    这是国家对部分普通高等院校进行充实整顿的先声。
    国家教委在一项整顿工作的计划中提出，凡办学条件尚未达到国务院发布的《普通高等学校设置暂行条例》的，即学校的领导班子、专任教师、土地校舍、图书设备、实习场地等达不到起码标准的高等院校，限期３年进行充实、加强、提高。整顿的重点是近几年新设置的不合格的那些普通高校。据有关部门估计，这类学校约有近２００所，是全国１０７５所普通高校中的一小部分。
    我国普通高等院校近１０年来在数量上有了长足的发展，但有些新设置的学校未经充分论证就仓促上马，造成布局不够合理、专业设置重复、投资效益和社会效益较低的状况，其中有些学校办学条件差，教学质量难以保证，也有的学校攀高求大，名称与实际不符，存在一定程度的混乱。一些老校又因长期超负荷运转，教学生活条件恶化，各项工作被扩大规模所产生的种种矛盾所困扰，影响内部管理和教育质量的提高。教育在大发展后必须有一个稳定规模的时期，用于消化、巩固、提高取得的成果，否则，就会痛苦地走回头路。对少数不合格普通高校进行整顿的决定，就是在这一背景下作出的。
    据介绍，这次充实、整顿工作结束后，国家教委将组织专家进行互检、验收和评估。在此基础上，国家将依照学校的层次，正式公布全国普通高等学校名单。
