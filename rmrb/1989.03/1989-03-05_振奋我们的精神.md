"Mixed feelings" was the phrase used by many newspapers to headline the 1988 national economic and social development statistical bulletin published a few days ago. These four characters accurately reflect the fact that our country's economic situation has both achieved significant results and faces many difficulties.

For a period of time, newspapers have emphasized the difficulties, which is necessary. If we do not see our difficulties, especially the financial and material difficulties, and rush to start projects and increase speed, this is an old habit of some comrades and a common problem in the process of opening up and reform. Pouring some cold water to make people sober up and see the current severe economic situation is very important. However, this does not mean that the more difficulties we talk about, the better. If we talk too much about difficulties, it seems that there are difficulties everywhere, which can only lead to a loss of confidence and a lack of spirit. Now it is necessary to emphasize that while seeing the difficulties, we should also see that our achievements are still the main aspect, so as to revitalize our spirits, enhance our confidence, and work together to improve the economic environment and economic order according to the spirit of the Thirteenth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

In the ten years of reform, our economic strength has more than doubled, and the living standards of the people have generally improved significantly. This is well-known both domestically and internationally. Although inflation occurred last year, in terms of the overall economy, we still made progress rather than regressed. This is clearly shown by the figures in the 1988 bulletin of the National Bureau of Statistics. A greater progress that the figures cannot fully reflect is that the new system of socialist commodity economy is growing on our vast land, bringing vigorous vitality to this ancient nation. With the continuous development and improvement of the new system, we will surely break away from the stagnant situation that has long plagued our nation and open up a path for our country to achieve long-term stability and prosperity.

Of course, we must also face the difficulties and problems we are facing and not take them lightly. For example, economic overheating, rapid price increases, and obvious inflation, as well as serious corruption within the party and society, all need to be seriously addressed and resolved with practical measures. Since the end of the Thirteenth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee four months ago, the work of rectification and rectification has already shown initial results, and the situation in various aspects is gradually stabilizing. Although there are still many problems, and many tasks are still far from the requirements of the Central Committee and the expectations of the people, we still need to make persistent efforts. However, the achievements of the past few months have shown that our party and government are facing difficulties, and the policies and measures to solve difficulties are appropriate, and the work is efficient. By following this path and pushing forward the work of rectification and rectification in a solid manner, we will surely achieve better results and create good conditions for the comprehensive deepening of reform.

Facing such a situation, what reason do we have not to revitalize our spirits, boost our morale, and do our work better?

In the face of difficulties and problems, people having opinions and complaining a bit is understandable. However, constantly complaining, talking nonsense, blaming others, and spreading negative and pessimistic emotions will not be beneficial to rectification, rectification, and deepening reform. This is not about not letting people speak, but rather hoping that comrades with such emotions will see the mainstream and overcome blind pessimism and despair. It is called blind because these comrades have not seen that the difficulties and problems we are currently facing are fundamentally difficulties and problems of development and progress. For example, the scale and speed of construction are too large, and compared with the "three difficult years," there is a fundamental difference. At that time, productive forces were seriously damaged, while now it is the overheating of productive forces on the basis of great development. After rectification and rectification, difficulties can be overcome, and economic development will still maintain a relatively fast speed. Again, some negative, ugly, and corrupt things are the dregs that have risen in the gap of the new system not yet fully established in the process of great development and change of society, and are not inherent in the new system. These problems will be gradually solved with the establishment and improvement of the new system.

Revitalizing spirits and enhancing confidence, first of all, is for communists, especially party leaders, to revitalize spirits and enhance confidence. In the history of our party, we have encountered difficulties much greater than those we are facing now, but true communists have never been intimidated. As a result, we have overcome one difficulty after another. At present, we especially need to carry forward this good tradition, advocate seeing the light in the face of difficulties, and raise our courage. We should advocate unity in the face of difficulties, come up with ideas, think of solutions, and put forward more constructive opinions. Every communist and every party cadre should set an example in this regard, and with practical actions, adhere to the reform and opening-up policy and strategy that have been proven successful in practice, and through hard work, make China prosperous.

　　振奋我们的精神
    本报评论员
    “喜忧交织”，是前几天公布１９８８年国民经济和社会发展统计公报时，许多报纸的标题用语。这四个字比较准确地反映了我国经济形势既有取得很大成绩的一面，也有存在很多困难的另一面。
    一个时期以来，报纸上对困难说得比较多，这是必要的。看不到我们的困难，特别是财力、物力上的困难，急于上项目、抢速度，是一些同志的老毛病，也是开放改革中的通病。多泼几盆冷水，使头脑清醒清醒，看到当前严峻的经济形势，很重要。但是，这绝不意味着把困难说得越多越好。困难说多了，说过头了，好像到处都是困难，只能造成丧失信心、精神不振的负效应。现在有必要强调在看到困难的同时，也要看到我们取得的成绩还是主要的，从而振奋我们的精神，增强我们的信心，同心同德，按照党的十三届三中全会的精神搞好治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序的工作。
    改革十年，我们的经济实力翻了一番多，人民生活水平也普遍有了较大幅度的提高。这是国内外共知的。去年尽管发生了通货膨胀，但在经济的总体上我们还是前进了，而不是后退了。这是国家统计局１９８８年公报的数字说得很清楚的。而数字未能完全表现出来的一个更大的进步在于，社会主义商品经济的新体制正在我们广袤的国土上成长起来，它给我们这个古老的民族带来了勃勃生机。随着新体制的不断发展和完善，我们必将摆脱历史上曾长期困扰我们这个民族的停滞局面，开辟出使我们国家长治久安、日益繁荣的坦途。
    当然，对我们面临的困难和问题也要正视，不能掉以轻心。比如经济过热，物价上涨过猛，出现了明显的通货膨胀，以及党内和社会上的腐败现象严重等等，都要拿出切实的办法来认真地克服和解决。党的十三届三中全会结束四个月以来，治理、整顿工作已经初见成效，各方面的情况都渐趋于稳定。虽然存在的问题还不少，很多工作离中央的要求、离老百姓的期望还很远，还需要我们作坚持不懈的努力，但是这几个月来的成效，毕竟说明了我们党和政府是正视困难的，解决困难的方针、政策和措施是得当的，工作是有效率的。沿着这个路子，扎扎实实地推进治理、整顿工作，就一定能收到更好的效果，为全面深化改革创造良好的条件。
    面对着这样的形势，我们有什么理由不振奋精神，鼓起干劲，把我们的工作做得更好呢？
    在困难和问题面前，人们有意见，发点牢骚，是可以理解的。但是，老是发牢骚、讲怪话，怨天尤人，互相泄气，散布消极悲观情绪，这对于治理、整顿和深化改革，不会有任何好处。这并不是不让人讲话，而是希望有这种情绪的同志要看到主流，克服盲目的悲观失望情绪。说它盲目，是因为这些同志没有看到我们目前所遇到的困难和问题，从根本上来看，是发展中的困难，是前进中的问题。比如基建规模过大、速度过快等等，和“三年困难时期”相比，有本质的不同。那时生产力遭到了严重的破坏，而现在则是生产力大发展基础上的过热，经过治理、整顿，困难可以克服，经济发展也还会保持较快的速度。又比如有些消极、丑恶、腐败的东西，是在社会大发展大变动中乘着新体制还没有完全确立的空隙而泛起的沉渣，并不是新体制所固有的。这些弊端会随着新体制的建立和完善逐步解决。
    振奋精神、增强信心，首先是共产党人，特别是党的领导干部要振奋精神，增强信心。我们党的历史上，曾遇到过比目前大得多的困难，但真正的共产党人从来没有被吓倒过。结果，困难一个一个地被我们战胜了。当前，我们特别要发扬这个好的传统，提倡在困难的时候要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气，提倡在困难面前团结起来，出主意，想办法，多提建设性的意见。每一个共产党员，每一个党的干部，都要在这方面做出表率，以实际行动坚持已被实践证明是成功的改革开放的方针和战略，通过艰苦的努力，使中国振兴起来。
