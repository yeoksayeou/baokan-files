    Questioning the Grain Foundation Theory
    Liu Zhenbang

    Abstract: Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Is grain the foundation of the foundation? Liu Zhenbang raises doubts about this. He believes that this is not much different from the past emphasis on "grain first." He advocates changing this mindset, learning from the experience of Western Europe, and indirectly promoting grain production and reducing human grain consumption through the development of livestock farming.

    In China, the idea of grain as the foundation of agriculture has a long history. The saying that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation, is a typical summary of this idea.

    Is it possible to say that grain is the foundation?

    Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy because all sectors of the national economy rely on agriculture for resources. Without agriculture, other sectors cannot exist. In 1960, 57% of the raw materials consumed by American industry came from agriculture. The figure is even higher in traditional countries.

    The grain foundation theory borrows the idea that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. In fact, grain and other sectors of agriculture are not in a relationship where one determines the other. We can say that without agriculture, there would be no national economy, but we cannot say that without grain, there would be no agriculture.

    The grain foundation theory is essentially a new term for "grain first" in the new situation. We have suffered a lot from the "grain first" policy. However, now it is said that without grain as the foundation, nothing else can develop, and all land suitable for grain should be used for grain, fruits should go to the mountains, and grain should pass the test, etc. This seems to be no different from the past emphasis on "grain first." The summer oranges in Guangxi's Guilin region are famous. In the past, they were cultivated on the plains, with high water content and quality, and could enter the international market. After moving to the mountains, the water content decreased, making it difficult to export. The question is, is it more cost-effective to grow summer oranges on the plains here, earn foreign exchange on the international market, and buy grain, or to use the valuable plains to grow low-value grain? We have not even calculated this account yet.

    Following the old thinking and policies, we will never pass the "test." The per capita grain production in our country has been around 400 kilograms for decades and is unlikely to increase significantly in the next few decades. While most Western European countries entered the era of livestock farming when their per capita grain consumption was less than 350 kilograms. They replaced low-yield grain with high-yield forage. In 1900, grain accounted for 61% of Western Europe's agricultural output. Now, grain accounts for only 12% of Western Europe's agricultural output. The "grain first" policy and the grain foundation theory have affected this transformation in our country.

    From the perspective of traditional agriculture, food is grain. Because grain was the main food in the traditional agricultural period, people have the illusion that grain equals food. The development of modern commercial agriculture requires people to free themselves from this mindset, broaden their horizons, and comprehensively develop food production.

    Whether from the perspective of agriculture or the entire economy, grain is extremely important. But importance and foundation are two different things.

    Countries like the United States, Canada, and Australia, with fewer people and more land, can develop grain production in a straight line. Our country has a history of less land and more people, and all agricultural products are in short supply. In the transition from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture and from self-sufficient agriculture to commercial agriculture, grain production should take a detour.

    The Western European approach is very enlightening. Their approach is to change the cultivation system, that is, to change from large-scale cultivation to mixed cultivation. Large-scale cultivation is mainly grain-based and belongs to the traditional cultivation system. Mixed cultivation is mainly forage-based, raising dairy cows, and belongs to the modern cultivation system. They use two-thirds of their agricultural land to grow forage and raise dairy cows. Dairy cows are the most efficient grazing livestock, and developed countries are vigorously promoting grass cultivation, seeking milk and meat from grass, and placing dairy farming at the forefront of agriculture to promote grain production. In 1950, France's grain production was only 13.6 million tons, and it had to import 10 million tons from the United States. In 1984, grain production reached 54 million tons, with a net export of nearly 30 million tons per year. It was precisely during the 1950s and 1960s that the detour of promoting livestock farming significantly increased their grain yield per unit area, rapidly reduced per capita grain consumption, eased grain pressure, and solved the grain problem. At that time, some people in Western Europe also advocated straight-line development of grain, but this unprofitable proposal was negated by private farms in practice that pursued profits.

    Why should livestock farming be developed to indirectly promote grain production and reduce human grain consumption? Because modern agriculture and commercial agriculture are for sales and to meet the food structure requirements of rural urbanization. This requires the development of livestock farming and food processing. Western countries provide 70%-80% of agricultural raw materials for industry from livestock farming. It can be said that without livestock farming, there would be no food processing industry, and without the food processing industry, there would be no commercialization and modernization of agriculture. The Western livestock industry, led by dairy farming, is responsible for the biological processing of planting, on-site conversion, and improving agricultural economic benefits and added value. In a sense, livestock farming is the processing industry of planting, and the food industry is the processing industry of livestock farming. Modern livestock farming is based on high-yield forage cultivation. Modern agriculture and processing are based on dairy farming, and milk and beef do not require concentrated feed, and can be obtained by converting forage.

    From the actual situation in the world, especially in developing countries, the potential of land to produce grain is limited, but the potential to produce forage is great. To keep the potential of domestic land to produce grain in balance with the population growth demand for grain, it is necessary to prevent land degradation. Growing forage is a good measure to prevent land degradation with less investment and greater returns. Therefore, for China, the problem to be solved is the food problem, not just viewing food as grain. The idea of grain as the foundation will inevitably lead to the single-minded pursuit of grain, which needs to be reversed.

### 粮食基础说质疑

专栏：怎样突破徘徊？——农业发展问题讨论

　　粮食基础说质疑
    刘振邦
    提要：农业是国民经济的基矗粮食是基础的基础吗？刘振邦对此提出质疑。他认为，这与过去强调“以粮为纲”似乎没有什么区别，主张改变这种思想观念，借鉴西欧的经验，通过发展畜牧业来间接地推动粮食生产和减少人的口粮消费。
    在中国，把粮食作为农业基础的思想由来已久。所谓农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础，就是这一思想的典型概述。
    　　　　能说粮食是基础吗？
    农业是国民经济的基础，是因为国民经济各部门都要依靠农业提供资源，没有农业，其他部门就不能存在。１９６０年，美国工业所消耗的原材料５７％来自农业。传统国家更高。
    粮食基础说套用了农业是国民经济基础的观念。其实，粮食和农业其他部门不是谁决定谁的关系。我们可以说，没有农业便没有国民经济，但不能说，没有粮食便没有农业。
    粮食基础说实际是以粮为纲在新形势下的一种新说法。我们吃过不少以粮为纲的苦头。可是，现在又说什么不以粮食为基础，其他都不能发展，要把一切适合种粮食的土地都种上粮食，水果上山，粮食要过关，等等。这与过去强调以粮为纲似乎没什么区别。广西桂林地区的夏橙很有名，过去在平原经营，水份多，质量高，可以进入国际市场。上山之后，水份下降，很难出口。试问，是在这里的平原种夏橙出口，换取外汇在国际市场上买粮合算，还是用适于夏橙的宝贵平原种价值低的粮食？我们现在都没有算开这笔账。
    按照旧的思路和方针，我们永远也过不了“关”。我国人均谷物一直在４００公斤左右徘徊，几十年之内也很难增加。而大部分西欧国家都是在人均占有粮食不足３５０公斤时进入了以畜牧业为主的时代。他们用高效益的牧草代替了低效益的粮食。１９００年，粮食尚占西欧农业总产值的６１％。现在，粮食只占西欧农业总产值的１２％。以粮为纲和粮食基础说影响了我国的这种转变。
    以传统农业观点看，食物就是粮食。因为粮食是传统农业时期的重要食物，因而人们产生了粮食等于食物的错觉。现代商品农业的发展，要求人们从这种思想中解放出来，放开眼界，全面地发展食物生产。
    　　　　走迂回的道路，发展我国粮食生产
    不论是从农业还是从整个经济考虑，粮食都极为重要。但重要和基础是两回事。
    美国、加拿大、澳大利亚等地多人少的国家，粮食可以直线发展。我们地少人多是历史的产物，一切农产品都紧张，在由传统农业向现代农业，由自给农业向商品农业转变的过程中，发展粮食生产应走迂回道路。
    西欧的道路很有启发。他们的道路是改变耕作制度，即把大田耕作改为混合型耕作。大田耕作以谷物为主，属于传统耕作制度。混合型耕作以牧草为主，种牧草养奶牛，属于现代耕作制度。他们把农用地的２／３用来种牧草养奶牛。奶牛是最有效的放牧牲畜，发达国家都在大力种草，向草要奶要肉，把奶牛业放在农业的首位，用此来推动谷物生产。１９５０年，法国谷物产量仅１３６０万吨，不得不从美国进口１０００万吨。１９８４年，谷物产量高达５４００万吨，年净出口近３０００万吨。恰恰是５０到６０年代，鼓励发展畜牧业的迂回道路，使他们的谷物单产空前提高，人均吃粮迅速减少，缓和了粮食压力，解决了粮食问题。当时西欧也有人主张直线发展粮食，但是这种不讲效益的主张，被追求效益的私人农场在实践中给否定了。
    为什么要通过发展畜牧业来间接地推动粮食生产和减少人的口粮消费呢？因为现代农业和商品农业是为了销售和满足农村城市化对食品结构的要求。这就要发展畜牧业和食品加工业。西方为工业提供农业原料的７０％—８０％来自畜牧业。可以说，没有畜牧业，就没有食品加工业，而没有食品加工业，就没有农业的商品化和现代化。以奶牛饲养业为主的西方畜牧业负责对种植业进行生物加工，就地转化，提高了农业经济效益和追加价值。从某种意义上讲，畜牧业是种植业的加工业，食品工业是畜牧业的加工业。现代牧业是以其高效的牧草种植为基础。现代农业和加工业是以奶牛业为主，奶和牛羊肉不用精饲料，基本上用牧草转化就可得来。
    从世界实际情况看，尤其是发展中国家，土地生产粮食的潜力已经有限，但生产牧草的潜力则很大。但生产牧草的潜力则很大。要想使本国土地生产粮食的潜力和人口增长对粮食增长的需要保持平衡，就必须阻止土地的退化。种牧草就是投资少，收益大，防止土地退化的最好措施。所以，对中国来说，应当解决的是食物问题，不应当把食物仅仅视作粮食。以粮食为基础的思想，必然造成单纯抓粮食的后果，应当扭转。
