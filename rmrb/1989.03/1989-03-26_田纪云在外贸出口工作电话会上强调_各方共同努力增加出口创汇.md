The State Council held a nationwide telephone conference on foreign trade export work this evening, mobilizing all parties to seize the current favorable opportunity, overcome difficulties, and increase export earnings.

White Meiqing, Vice Secretary of the State Council, presided over the meeting. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun delivered an important speech. Tian Jiyun demanded that all levels of government and departments should regard increasing export earnings and ensuring stable growth of the country's foreign exchange income as a major task, supporting and promoting the smooth progress of domestic economic adjustment and reform and opening up. He put forward requirements for ensuring the continued stable growth of exports. He said that the key is to strengthen leadership, unify thinking, take effective measures, mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, and work together to improve foreign trade export work.

He pointed out that the People's Bank of China and the Bank of China, as well as their local branches, should implement the state's industrial policies, take practical measures, and do everything possible to ensure that foreign trade enterprises and export production enterprises have the necessary credit funds. Other specialized banks should also provide support to the best of their abilities.

Tian Jiyun said that at present, spring cocoons, spring tea, and other export products are about to be marketed. To avoid a "battle" similar to last year, relevant provinces and regions should take necessary measures promptly to prevent such incidents from happening again. For those who engage in "battles" and do not rectify their behavior, the responsibility of the leaders and the parties involved should be investigated, and they should be severely punished. The cleanup and rectification of various foreign trade companies should continue to be strictly implemented. All localities and departments should strictly follow the State Council's documents and carry out the cleanup and rectification. Especially for those foreign trade companies at the bureau and department level established by local authorities, they should be strictly reviewed and rectified according to the conditions, without going through the motions or being perfunctory. For units with serious problems but weak rectification, the responsibility of the supervising departments and their leaders should be investigated. The stability of foreign trade export commodities, normal production, and increased effective supply should be ensured.

Tian Jiyun hopes that all departments will provide high-quality services for foreign trade and facilitate imports and exports. Improving foreign trade exports is not just the responsibility of the foreign trade departments; related departments should also make joint efforts. The transportation department should ensure the smooth flow of import and export goods, without congestion, pressure on ships, or ports. The customs and inspection departments should strictly control while simplifying procedures and improving efficiency. All aspects of production, circulation, finance, and other aspects should create good environmental conditions for foreign trade exports. Foreign trade enterprises should further strengthen and improve management during the rectification and improvement, improve enterprise quality, and improve efficiency. All levels of foreign trade departments and enterprises are on the front line of foreign trade work, with heavy responsibilities, arduous and glorious tasks. They must bravely shoulder the burden, work hard, and do everything possible to complete the tasks.

　　田纪云在外贸出口工作电话会上强调        
    各方共同努力增加出口创汇
    本报北京３月２５日讯  新华社记者张毅、本报记者陆振华报道：国务院今晚召开全国外贸出口工作电话会议，动员各方面抓住当前有利时机，克服困难，增加出口创汇。
    国务院副秘书长白美清主持会议，国务院副总理田纪云作了重要讲话。田纪云要求各级政府、各部门应把增加出口收汇、保证国家外汇收入稳定增长当作一件大事来抓，支持和促进国内经济调整和改革、开放的顺利进行。他对保证出口继续稳定增长提出了要求。他说，关键是加强领导、统一思想、采取有力措施，调动各方面的积极性、群策群力，共同把外贸出口工作搞上去。
    他指出，人民银行和中国银行以及各地分行要贯彻国家的产业政策，切实采取措施，千方百计保障外贸企业和出口生产企业必需的信贷资金。其他专业银行也要在力所能及的情况下积极给予支持。
    田纪云说，目前，春茧、春茶等出口产品上市在即，为避免发生“大战”，有关省、区要迅速采取必要的措施，保证不再发生去年的类似事件。对于发生抢购“大战”而又不改的，要追究领导者和当事人的责任，给以严厉的处分。要继续严格清理整顿各类对外经贸公司。各地、各部门要严格按照国务院文件去做，认真进行清理整顿。特别是对于那些由各地方批准成立的一些厅局级外贸公司，要严格按照条件认真清理、整顿，不得走过场，不得敷衍了事。对问题严重而又清理整顿不力的单位，要追究主管部门及其领导者的责任。要确保外贸出口商品的稳定，正常生产，增加有效供给。
    田纪云希望各部门要为外贸提供优质服务，便利进出口。把外贸出口搞上去，不仅仅是外贸部门的事情，有关部门要共同做出努力。交通运输部门，要保证外贸进出口货物畅通无阻，不堵塞，不压船、压港；海关、商检等部门既要严格把关，又要简化手续，提高办事效率；生产、流通、金融等各方面都要为外贸出口创造良好的环境条件。外贸企业要在治理整顿中进一步加强和改善经营管理，提高企业素质，提高效益。各级外贸部门和企业，处在外贸工作的第一线，责任重大，任务光荣而艰巨，一定要勇挑重担，努力工作，千方百计完成任务。
