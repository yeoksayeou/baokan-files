Title: Do Not Do Things Like "First Put Lice on Your Head and Then Scratch"

Except for mental patients, I don't think anyone would catch lice and put them on their own head to scratch, would they? However, in social life, such strange phenomena are often encountered. For example, with the development of the rural commodity economy, some labor force has moved to the city to do business or work, solving their own food problems, while their household registration remains in the countryside. This is originally a good thing, but some places have created so-called "peasant urban household registration." Some enterprises have recruited a large number of peasant workers, and after these peasants move to the city, many of them have built houses and changed their status from "agricultural" to "non-agricultural." As a result, the local government faces great pressure and difficulties in supplying water, electricity, grain, oil, and sideline products, as well as managing the enrollment of primary and secondary schools. The local government feels they are in a difficult situation and very troubled. Again, for example, in some places, the number of cadres is already far beyond the quota, but in order to catch the wave of "recruiting cadres," they have recruited more cadres from society, thinking they can achieve the goal of selecting and appointing the able. The result is that the original cadres cannot be placed, and some of the recruited cadres are not useful, making the organization increasingly bloated, the quota increasingly exceeded, and the urgently needed talents still feel insufficient. Furthermore, at present, some coastal open areas have opened "sauna bathhouses," "massage rooms," and "massage centers," giving rise to a group of "massage girls." If in some high-level hotels that receive foreign guests, opening massage projects (and under the premise of being law-abiding and civilized) is because of the need for opening up to the outside world, then in some places where "massage" is used as a means of internal communication and reception and to attract customers, it not only exists as a problem of overconsumption but also has many that are disguised as places of debauchery, seriously polluting social customs (quoting from the January 18, 1989, *Southern Daily*).

To be fair, some places and some people "catch lice and put them on their heads to scratch" are not what they originally intended. They are mostly due to lack of experience and insufficient comprehensive analysis of the situation, thinking that as long as they dare to "innovate" it is "reform," and daring to imitate the West is "opening up," without knowing that reform and opening up are a systematic and complex social project. Every step taken must be carefully weighed for its pros and cons, considering the comprehensive benefits it produces, including economic benefits and social benefits. Only after putting the "lice" on the head and feeling "itchy" do they realize the mistake of the past, but the loss has already been caused.

　　莫做“先放虱子后挠头”的事
    杜渺
    除非是精神病患者，我想是不会有人捉了虱子放在自家头上挠的吧？但是在社会生活中，这种怪现象却常常遇到。例如，随着农村商品经济的发展，有一部分劳动力进城经商做工，口粮自己解决，户口仍在农村，本来是一件好事，可有些地方却搞了许多所谓“农民进城户口”；有些企业招进了大批农民工，这些农民进城后不少人盖了房子“农转非”，随之给城镇水电、粮油、副食品供应和中小学学籍管理带来了很大的压力和困难。对这批人，当地政府感到骑虎难下，很挠头。又如，有的地方本来干部已经大大超编，却为了赶“招聘干部”的浪头，又从社会上招聘了干部，以为可以达到选贤任能的目的，结果原有的干部无法安置，招聘的干部也有一些人不顶用，弄得机构越来越膨胀，编制越超越多，急需要的人才却又感到不够用；再如，目前沿海一些开放地区开设了“桑拿浴室”、“按摩室”、“按摩中心”，出现了一批“按摩小姐”。如果说在个别接待外商的高级宾馆里开设按摩项目（且在守法和文明的前提下）是因为对外开放需要的话，那么在某些地方出现的将“按摩”作为内部交际接待的方式和招徕顾客的手段，那就“不仅存在着超前消费的问题，而且有不少是变相的色情场所，严重污染了社会风气”（引用１月１８日《南方日报》语）。
    说句公道话，有些地方、有些人“捉了虱子放在头上挠”也并非其本来所愿。他们大都是由于缺乏经验，遇事全面分析不够，以为只要勇于“标新立异”就是“改革”，敢于模仿西方就是“开放”，而不知道改革开放是一项系统的复杂的社会工程，每跨一步都必须认真衡量利弊得失，顾及其所产生的包括经济效益、社会效益等在内的综合效益，把“虱子”放到头上，感到“痒”了，才想到当初的不是，损失则已造成了。
