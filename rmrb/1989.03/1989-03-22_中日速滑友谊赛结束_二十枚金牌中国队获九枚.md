　　中日速滑友谊赛结束        
    二十枚金牌中国队获九枚
    新华社长春３月１９日电  （记者胡浩）第１４届中日速滑友谊赛今晚在长春冰上训练基地鸣金收兵。在４大项共２０枚金牌的争夺中，中国队获９枚，日本获得１１枚。
    在今晚最后两项比赛中，中国队的张青以８分１６秒８３的成绩获得女子全能５０００米的金牌；佟海燕和刘君红分获第二、三名。
    女子全能的金牌被日本队的关奈津江以１８８．８３９分的总成绩夺得。中国队的张青获得了银牌，她的队友佟海燕居第三名。
    纵观整个比赛可以看出，日本队在短距离比赛中的实力明显高于中国队；长距离比赛，中国队稍占优势。中国队员的表现，与前几届比进步不小，个别项目与日本队差距缩小。行家认为，中国队在起跑速度、弯道技术等方面还有待于提高。
