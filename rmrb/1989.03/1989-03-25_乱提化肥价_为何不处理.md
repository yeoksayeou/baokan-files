In the second half of 1987, our province's township and county enterprise bureau obtained a batch of non-planned imported urea, deciding to have each county's township and county enterprise bureau handle the sales directly. Our county's township and county enterprise bureau was allocated 1,000 tons of urea. Because the purchase price of this batch of urea was relatively high, the provincial authorities required that it be sold at a slight profit of 2% over the purchase price plus transportation and miscellaneous fees. Thus, the selling price per ton of urea should have been 915.47 yuan. After learning of this, the county supply and marketing cooperative and its subsidiary, the county agricultural materials company, approached county leaders, requesting to handle the sales of this batch of urea. The county government decided that the county agricultural materials company would pay the county township and county enterprise bureau a "handling fee" of 40,000 yuan, transferring this batch of fertilizer to the county agricultural materials company for sales.

After the county agricultural materials company transported this batch of urea to our county, they collaborated with the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives to calculate the costs, including the 40,000 yuan "handling fee" paid to the county township and county enterprise bureau, and increased the transportation and management fees, setting the price accordingly. This raised the selling price of this batch of urea by 144.53 yuan per ton.

In the first half of 1988, the county price inspection bureau discovered this situation and demanded that it be investigated, but some county leaders disagreed. Recently, the county price inspection team determined that the county township and county enterprise bureau and the county agricultural materials company, along with the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives, had arbitrarily raised the price of urea, illegally gaining a total profit of 134,000 yuan. Of this, the county township and county enterprise bureau gained 40,000 yuan, and the county agricultural materials company and the grassroots cooperatives gained 94,000 yuan. However, some county leaders still disagree with handling the matter.

　　乱提化肥价　为何不处理
    １９８７年下半年，我省乡镇企业局搞到一批计划外的进口尿素，决定由各县乡镇企业局直接经销。我县乡镇企业局分得尿素１０００吨。因为这批尿素进价较高，省里要求各地只能按进价加运杂费和２％的微利销售。这样，每吨尿素的售价应为９１５．４７元。县供销社及其下属单位县农资公司知道后，找县里有关领导同志，要求经销这批尿素。县政府决定，县农资公司付给县乡镇企业局４万元“手续费”，把这批化肥转给县农资公司经销。
    县农资公司将这批尿素运到我县后，便与基层供销社合伙核算，将付给县乡镇企业局的４万元“手续费”纳入进价，还加大运杂费和经营管理费等，依此定价，使得这批尿素的销价每吨提高１４４．５３元。
    １９８８年上半年，我县物价检查所发现这一情况后，要求查处此事，但县里个别负责人不同意。前不久，县物价检查组核定，县乡镇企业局和县农资公司及基层供销社随意提高尿素价格，总共非法获利１３．４万元。其中，县乡镇企业局得４万元，县农资公司和基层社得９．４万多元。可县里个别负责人仍不同意处理。
