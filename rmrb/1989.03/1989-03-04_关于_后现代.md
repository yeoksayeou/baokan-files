	On "Postmodernism"
	Li Zehou

	Xu Shucheng asked me to write a preface for his "New Interpretations of Art Aesthetics." Although I cannot comment on Shucheng's book, because first, I haven't read it; second, some parts I have read, but I have forgotten them, so I can't say anything about them. Therefore, I can only use this opportunity to talk about something else.

	This "something else" is the so-called "postmodern" issue briefly mentioned and not fully developed in my recently submitted "Four Lectures on Aesthetics."

	The so-called "postmodern" in the field of arts seems to have started with architecture, that is, opposing the "functionalism" of modernist architecture that has been popular in this century and has already taken the dominant position, such as those almost identical cuboid skyscrapers, etc. It gradually became a characteristic description of various types of art in the Western world after the Second World War. According to the famous theory of F. Jameson, "postmodernism" is a negation of "modernism," and some of its basic characteristics are: meaningless, thoughtless, shallow, commercialized, popularized, ahistorical, not thinking about the future, only seeking the present moment, etc.

	In "Four Lectures on Aesthetics," I regard these as "extreme modern" (extremely modern) rather than "postmodern" (post-modern). On the surface, the characteristics described by F. Jameson seem to be a deviation and negation of "modern"; but in essence, I believe they are precisely the extreme expansion and direct extension of "modern," and this expansion and extension are manifested as a kind of "popularization." It commercializes, popularizes, stylizes, and decorates the various thoughts and emotions of advanced intellectuals against capitalist society and the bourgeoisie, as expressed in modernist art, such as absurdity, loneliness, alienation, etc. Thus, "absurdity," "loneliness" become common, "alienation" becomes normal, and "meaning" becomes "meaningless" ... The entire rebellious art and art of rebellion can be dissolved in this era of mass high consumption. Not only in the weird and wonderful advertising art, but also in the numerous museums, exhibitions, and galleries.

	This is what I call the "rule" or phenomenon of "from representation to expression, from expression to decoration" ("Four Lectures on Aesthetics"). "Extreme modern" makes many types of art and works into decorations, which is precisely the characteristic of post-imperialist (post-World War II) art. As for the "postmodern" art, I think it should be the art of post-capitalism, and its characteristics seem to be yearning for the Middle Ages and the countryside, pursuing the meaning of emotional essence, the unity of man and nature, etc. These are currently in their infancy, and the time of prosperity is still far away.

	Therefore, I advocate distinguishing "postmodern" from "extreme modern" in theory (and in creative practice). Of course, there is a purely definitional issue here. If the term "postmodern" has already been commonly used to describe the phenomenon I call "extreme modern," then it cannot be changed. Therefore, this issue only has a purely theoretical significance and does not need to pursue "correct naming."

	I advocate seeking "meaning," whether it is life itself, human life, or art. And some "meaninglessness" itself also has or can find meaning. Seeking "meaning" may be laughable. People are originally born in a confused state, live on, and die without any meaning. But in contemporary China, it is not necessarily the case. Death is not mentioned, but being born and living on is not easy. China's life, human life, and art are still far from that "meaningless" "extreme modern." However, it is puzzling that the talents in the country are particularly fond of singing the "most novel" theories of "meaninglessness" and "literature equals the earth," which I find hard to understand.

	Because the title of Shucheng's book contains the word "new," I thought of "meaninglessness" and "meaning." I have already gone off-topic (preface) by a thousand miles, hoping that Shucheng and the readers will understand.

### 关于“后现代”

　　关于“后现代”
    李泽厚
    徐书城要我为他的《艺术美学新义》写序。尽管我对书城的书不能发表什么意见，因为第一、没有读；第二、有些虽读过，但亦已忘怀，无从说起。于是，只好借题说点别的什么了。
    这个“别的什么”，便是最近匆忙交稿的《美学四讲》一书中所简略提到而远欠发挥的所谓“后现代”问题。
    文艺领域的所谓“后现代”，似乎是从建筑艺术开始提出的，即反对流行在这个世纪并早已占据统治地位的“功能主义”的现代派建筑，即那几乎千篇一律的方盒子的摩天大楼，等等。它转而逐渐成为第二次世界大战之后的西方世界各部类艺术的某种特征描述。如按最近Ｆ·Ｊａｍｅｓｏｎ的著名论说，所谓“后现代”是对“现代主义”的否定，它的一些基本特征是：无意义、无思想、无深度、商业化、大众化、非历史、不想未来，只求顷刻的现在，等等。
    我在《美学四讲》里，把这些看作是“极度现代”（ｅｘｔｒｅｍｅｌｙ　ｍｏｄｅｒｎ），而不看作是“后现代”（ｐｏｓｔ—ｍｏｄｅｒｎ）。从表面看来，Ｆ·Ｊａｍｅｓｏｎ所描述的这些特征似乎是对“现代”的背离和否定；但实质上，我认为，它们恰好是“现代”的极度扩展和直接伸延，这种扩展和伸延表现为某种“普及化”。它将现代派艺术所表现的那种种先进知识分子反资本主义社会反资产阶级的思想情绪，如荒诞、孤独、异化感等等加以商业化、大众化、风格化、装饰化，从而，“荒诞”、“孤独”变成平常，“异化”乃正常，“意义”成了“无意义”……整个反抗的艺术和艺术的反抗便可以消融在这个群众高额消费的时代中。不仅在稀奇古怪的广告艺术中，而且也在众多的博物馆、展览会和林立的画廊中。这也就是我所谓的“由再现到表现，由表现到装饰”（《美学四讲》）的“规律”或现象。“极度现代”使许多艺术种类和作品成了装饰，这正是后帝国主义（第二次世界大战后）的艺术特征。至于艺术的“后现代”，我以为该是后资本主义的艺术，它的特征似乎该是向往中古和田园，追求情感本体的意义、天人合一，等等。这些目前只有萌芽，兴盛之时，为期尚远。
    所以我是主张在理论上（以及在创作实践上）区分开“后现代”与“极度现代”的。当然，这里有一个纯粹属于定义的问题。如果“后现代”一词已经约定俗成地用来描述我所谓的“极度现代”的现象，那也就无法改易了。因此这问题只具有纯理论的意味，而不必去追求“正名”了。
    我是主张寻求“意义”的，不管是生活本身也好，人生也好，艺术也好。并且某些“无意义”本身，也仍然具有或可以找到意义。寻找“意义”，也许可笑。人本来就是糊里糊涂地被生出来，活下去，死了更无意义可言。但在此时此地的中国，却又未必尽然。死暂且不说，生出来，活下去，便不容易。中国的生活、人生和艺术离那个“无意义”的“极度现代”还遥远得很。然而，不解的是国中才子们却偏偏热衷于高唱“无意义”、“文学等于地球”之类“最最崭新”的理论，使我难以理解。
    因书城的书名有“新义”二字，由之联想及“无意义”与“意义”。已离题（书序）万里，望书城及读者谅之。
