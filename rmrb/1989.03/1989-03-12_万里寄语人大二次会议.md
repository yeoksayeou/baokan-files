Wan Li, the Chairman, in his speech at the conclusion of the seventh session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress on March 11, expressed the hope that the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress would fully uphold democracy, speak freely, and that the deputies would jointly contribute ideas, think of solutions, and pool their wisdom. He hoped the meeting would be a spirited and confident gathering that would promote the rectification and deepening of reforms.

He emphasized that for the smooth implementation of the rectification and deepening of reforms, it is crucial to have a stable domestic environment. The imposition of martial law in Lhasa by the State Council is entirely necessary. Emphasizing stability is to create favorable conditions for reform and opening up.
