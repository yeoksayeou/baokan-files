Japanese skater Ito Midori won the gold medal in the women's singles event at the 78th World Figure Skating Championships today. This is the first time an Asian skater has won the title since the championship was established in 1906.

The 19-year-old Ito Midori captivated the audience with her triple jump and other difficult moves in the free skating final this afternoon, securing the first place. Five judges gave her a perfect score of 6.0 for technical merit, while the other four judges awarded her 5.9. Ito Midori made her mark at last year's Winter Olympics, finishing fifth, and placed sixth at last year's World Championships.

West German skater Leuschner and American skater Trennary won the silver and bronze medals, respectively.
