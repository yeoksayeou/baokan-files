The works "Living Hell" by Sū Xiǎokāng and Zhāng Mǐn, and recent works by Jiā Lǔshēng, Mài Tiāngōng, and Shā Qīng, indicate that reportage literature is quietly undergoing a transformation: it is shifting away from emphasizing events and instead delving into the spiritual reality of individuals and analyzing cultural psychological structures. The subtitles of "Living Hell" and Shā Qīng's "Dimly Remembered Dàdì Wān" — "A Report on Our Souls" and "My or Our Spiritual Reality" — convey new information about reportage literature.

We have come to realize that as reportage literature presents more and more events to readers in a formulaic way, readers' sensitive minds may become desensitized. The deepening of reportage literature is not just a matter of artistic techniques; it is equally important to reveal the deeper implications of the subjects of reportage. Many reportage writers are easily seduced by the chaotic surface of events, but is there something more intrinsic that reportage writers have overlooked? It seems there is. In this sense, we appreciate reportage writers' new efforts to analyze human spiritual phenomena or cultural psychological structures.

Exploring the diseased world of the soul to reflect on our spiritual phenomena is a meaningful attempt in reportage literature. Sū Xiǎokāng and Zhāng Mǐn ingeniously use a few twisted, struggling, and tormented souls to tell us tragic life stories: political setbacks have twisted the soul of that "associate professor" from the liberated area, making him live in a state of obsessive cleanliness; the self-narratives of two young people in a psychiatric hospital show a person's unwillingness to become a madman and their helplessness; the most thought-provoking is that the "student returning from the Soviet Union" was hospitalized to regain his sanity, but after regaining consciousness, he returns to the pain of reality and goes mad again... Their process of becoming ill seems not to be just a personal experience. In the diseased spiritual world, there is normality, and what we consider normal in some political and secular realities is not without pathology; otherwise, the medical student would not have suffered a mental collapse due to serious work. From this, we can somewhat discover the deformed side of our spiritual world.

"The Report on Our Souls" has a "cruel" impact on people. "Are they really mad, or are the people living in the outside world mad?" This question will always haunt people as long as the social ills are not cured. Thus, the topic turns to national character. This is an era that needs to promote national spirit, but promoting does not mean praise poems. As the reform deepens, the problem of how to eliminate obstacles to national spirit becomes more prominent. Exposing and criticizing the negative traits of our nation should become a theme in reportage literature. Jiā Lǔshēng's "The Factory Director Who Couldn't Leave the 'Mill'" and "Ancient Desolate Tombs" fully pay attention to this point. His call for the modernization of people will gradually become a strong theme in reportage literature. Jiā Lǔshēng's "The Asian Vicious Circle" and Mài Tiāngōng's "The West is Migrating," and Shā Qīng's "Dimly Remembered Dàdì Wān" analyze the "poverty spirit" in national character, which can be said to be in harmony. "The Asian Vicious Circle" uses a rosy background to write about the gray spiritual phenomena in the rise of a fishing company. Poverty makes people unable to save themselves, and they can only wait for the "Dragon King" to bestow upon them a person who knows how to carry out reforms and help them get rid of poverty. This spiritual starting point determines that they will later enter two vicious circles: one with "poverty" and "abstract freedom," and the other with "prosperity" and "concrete dictatorship."

At this level, I feel the connection between reportage writers and Mr. Lu Xun, although they have not yet reached Mr. Lu Xun's level. I believe that the most profound criticism of reportage literature is not in the exposure of certain political or social problems, but in the dissection of the masses' survival mentality.

On the other hand, when exploring spiritual reality, writers naturally have to examine their living space. We cannot say that their dissection has reached the deep layer, but because of the analysis of spiritual phenomena, they undoubtedly approach the deep layer. The living conditions and behaviors of the common people in "The West is Migrating" and "Dimly Remembered Dàdì Wān" naturally have many "inherited genes," but they are constrained by the current social mechanism and its operation links. Mài Tiāngōng's dissection is thought-provoking: "When society fully plays its superiority, it unknowingly fully plays out the corrupt dependency in human nature, making a large number of people materially and spiritually impoverished, making the desert of human nature vast and boundless." In fact, our social mechanism has had both positive and negative effects in the forty-year process. Reform is to eliminate the negative effects that are expanding. When we swallow the bitter pill of poverty, we will also realize that spiritual "poverty alleviation" is equally important and difficult.

We must sing a dirge for negative traits and summon the souls of those with twisted hearts. What makes people go from normal to pathological? It is difficult to find the cause only in the spiritual world. People's spiritual state is usually a colorful projection of social politics, culture, morality, and other factors. Sū Xiǎokāng and Zhāng Mǐn painfully discover that "the external world of the soul is a very cruel arena." Since "our souls have almost all been twisted, and our 'internal strife' is rampant," when we think about "how a person can prevent his soul from becoming his own prison," it seems necessary to consider another question: How can a person prevent himself from becoming someone else's hell?

### 正视我们的心灵——报告文学创作的新转换

　　正视我们的心灵
    ——报告文学创作的新转换
    王尧
    苏晓康、张敏的《活狱》和贾鲁生、麦天枢、沙青的近作预示着报告文学创作正悄悄地发生某种转换：淡化事件而切入人的精神现实并剖析文化心理结构。《活狱》和沙青《依稀大地湾》的副题——“关于我们心灵的报告”，“我或我们的精神现实”传递出报告文学创作的新信息。
    我们已经意识到：当报告文学以一种程式将愈来愈多的事件推到读者面前时，读者敏感的心理不是没有钝化的可能，报告文学的深化不仅是艺术手段问题，如何揭示报告对象的深层内涵在当前显得同样重要。许多报告文学家很容易被杂然纷陈的事件表象所诱惑，是否有更内在的东西为报告文学家所疏忽？看来是有的。正是在这个意义上我们赞赏报告文学家探析人的精神现象或文化心理结构的新努力。
    由心灵的病态世界而反观我们的精神现象，是报告文学创作一次有意义的尝试。苏晓康、张敏独具匠心，以几颗扭曲的苦挣的煎熬的灵魂，向我们诉说悲惨的人生故事：政治上受挫后的精神压力扭曲了那位来自解放区的“副教授”的心灵，肮脏感使他以洁癖方式生存；精神病院两位青年的自述展示了一个人不愿成为疯子而又无可奈何的心态；最耐人寻味的是，“留苏学生”住院是为了恢复正常人的清醒，但清醒后回到现实的痛苦中又重新发疯……他们的病变过程，看来并不是个人的遭遇。病态的精神世界中存在着常态，而我们视为常态的某种现实政治和世俗社会则不无病态，否则，那位医学院研究生就不会由于认真工作而使精神崩溃。由此多少可以发现我们精神世界畸形的一面。
    “关于我们心灵的报告”给人的震慑力是“残酷”的。“究竟他们是疯子，还是活在外面世界里的人是疯子？”这样一个问题将永远缠绕着人们，只要社会的病灶得不到根治。于是，话题就要转到国民性上。这是一个需要弘扬民族精神的时代，但弘扬不等于赞美诗。随着改革的深入，如何清除民族精神障碍的问题也更为突出。揭示并批判我们民族的劣根性应当成为报告文学创作的主题。贾鲁生的《未能走出“磨房”的厂长》、《千古荒坟》充分注意到了这一点，他对人的现代化的呼唤将会逐渐成为报告文学创作的强音。贾鲁生的《亚细亚怪圈》和麦天枢的《西部在移民》、沙青的《依稀大地湾》对国民性中“贫困精神”的剖析可谓异曲同工。《亚细亚怪圈》在一家渔业公司崛起的背景上，用玫瑰色的底调写了灰色的精神现象。贫困使人不能拯救自己，只有等待“龙王爷恩赐给他们一个人，一个有本事、有权威、知道怎么闹改革、能帮助他们摆脱贫困的带头人”，这样一种精神起点，决定了他的日后将进入两个怪圈：一个里面有“贫困”和“抽象的自由”，另一个里面有“富裕”和“具体的独裁”。
    在这个层面上，我感受到报告文学家和鲁迅先生的相通之处，虽然他们尚未达到先生的境界。我认为，报告文学最深刻的批判不在对某个政治或社会问题的揭露，而在解剖民众生存心态。
    另一方面在探析精神现实时，作家们自然要审视其生存空间。我们还不能说他们的解剖已在深层，但因了对精神现象的探析，无疑切近了深层层面。《西部在移民》和《依稀大地湾》中老百姓的生存状态与行为方式，自然有众多“遗传因子”，但它受制于现行的社会机制及其运行环节。麦天枢所作的解剖是令人深思的：“社会在充分发挥它的优越性的时候，不知不觉地把人的品质中腐朽的依赖性充分地发挥出来，使大批土地物质贫困又陪伴着精神的贫困，使人性的沙漠浩瀚无垠。”事实上，我们的社会机制在四十年的历史进程中，有正负双重作用。改革便是要消除正在膨胀的负作用。我们在吞下贫困这杯苦酒时也将醒悟到：精神上的“扶贫”同样重要和艰难。
    我们既要为劣根性唱一首挽歌，又要为心灵扭曲者招魂。究竟是什么使人由常态而病态，只在心灵世界内寻觅原因是困难的，人的精神状态通常是社会政治、文化、道德等色彩斑斓的投影。苏晓康、张敏痛苦地发现“心灵的外部世界是一个很严酷的角斗场”。既然“我们的心灵几乎都被扭曲过，我们的‘窝里斗’十分盛行”，那么当我们在思考“一个人怎样才能不使他的心灵成为他自己的牢狱”时，似乎有必要再考虑另一个问题：一个人怎样才能不使自己成为他人的地狱？
