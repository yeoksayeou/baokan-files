China's annual production of various types of chewing gum and bubble gum has reached nearly 10,000 tons, surpassing the United States, which produces 8,000 tons annually, to become the world's largest producer.

Currently, there are over 100 enterprises in China producing chewing gum, mainly located in Shanghai, Heilongjiang, and other regions. The Shanghai Tianshan Hui Food Factory, which was the first to produce chewing gum in China, produced 2,000 tons of chewing gum last year. One-quarter of this production was exported to the Middle East and Eastern Europe, earning 1.3 million US dollars in foreign exchange.
