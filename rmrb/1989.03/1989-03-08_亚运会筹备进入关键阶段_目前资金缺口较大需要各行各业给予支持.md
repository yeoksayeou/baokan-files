The preparation for the Asian Games has entered a crucial stage. Currently, there is a significant funding gap, and support from all sectors is needed.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 7th. Reporter Huang Zhenzhong reports: Today, Vice Secretary-General Wang Zhiliang of the Asian Games Organizing Committee said in his office at Shishipi Hutong: "The overall construction of the Beijing Asian Games has been completed by 42%, and all work has entered a critical stage. There are still 563 days until the opening ceremony, time is tight, and the tasks are heavy. We hope for concern and support from all levels and sectors."

When discussing the heavy tasks, Wang Zhiliang said: "Some comrades are not very familiar with the overall situation of the Asian Games preparations. They think that building and renovating venues is almost enough, but in fact, this is a massive comprehensive system project. It includes the construction of apartments, municipal engineering, postal and telecommunications, television broadcasting, medical and health services, commercial network services, as well as the preparation of vegetables and food. Taking transportation as an example, there are 5 roads prepared for the Asian Games, namely the Fourth Ring Road, Anli Road, North Central Axis Road, East Central Axis Road, and Chengfu Road. These situations should be made known to everyone so that more people can care about the construction of the Asian Games project. The Asian Games Council will inspect the sports venues and municipal construction work in Beijing this year."

Wang Zhiliang today confirmed the difficulty of a significant funding gap for the Asian Games. He hopes that all sectors will support the Asian Games, contributing money where they can and effort where they can, with everyone working together. He also discussed the issue of fundraising. Fundraising is an international practice and a bridge for expressing people's wishes and strengthening friendly exchanges. Some primary school students donated a few cents, while some large corporations donated millions. All of these are expressions of their support for the Beijing Asian Games. In fact, fundraising for the Asian Games has become a form of rallying patriotic enthusiasm, attracting attention and support from domestic and international communities for the 11th Asian Games in 1990.

　　亚运会筹备进入关键阶段
    目前资金缺口较大需要各行各业给予支持
    本报北京３月７日讯  记者黄振中报道：今天，亚运会组委会副秘书长王志良在石碑胡同大坑前的办公室里接受记者采访时说：北京亚运会整个工程已完成４２％，各项工作进入关键阶段。现在离开幕时间还有５６３天，时间紧迫，任务繁重，希望上下关心，各行各业给予支持。
    在谈到任务繁重时，王志良说：有些同志对亚运会准备工作的概况还不大了解，以为光兴建改建场馆就差不多了，其实这是一个巨大的系统综合工程，它包括公寓建设、市政工程、邮电通讯、电视广播、医疗卫生、商业网点服务以及蔬菜食品等方面的准备。以交通为例，为亚运会准备的道路就有５条，即四环路、安立路、北中轴路、中轴东路和成府路。这些情况应让大家了解，以便使更多的人关心亚运会工程建设。亚奥理事会今年将要在北京验收体育场馆和市政建设工作。
    王志良今天证实了亚运会资金缺口较大的困难，他希望各行各业都来支持亚运会，有钱出钱，有力出力，上下齐心努力。他还谈到集资的问题。集资是国际惯例，是表达人们的意愿，加强友好往来的桥梁。有的小学生送来几角钱，有的大财团捐赠数百万，都是表示他们对北京亚运会的支持。实际上亚运会集资成为凝聚爱国热情的一种形式，吸引国内外各界人士对１９９０年第十一届亚运会的关注和支持。
