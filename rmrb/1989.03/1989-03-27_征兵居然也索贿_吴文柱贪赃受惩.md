Enlistment Surprisingly Involves Extortion
		Wu Wenzhu Punished for Bribery

		HARBIN, March 26 (Xinhua) — The Discipline Inspection Commission of Heilongjiang Province recently announced to the whole province that Wu Wenzhu, the head of the Jiangnan Township Military Affairs Office in Ning'an County, extorted money during the enlistment process and has been punished for violating party discipline and the law.

		Wu Wenzhu extorted money and gifts from over 10 people. Zhaoyaxin, a resident of Ning'an Town, applied to Wu Wenzhu to enlist in the army. Wu immediately agreed, stating that the quota was for rural areas and that there would be no job placement after discharge. After the physical examination, Zhaoyaxin's parents inquired about their son's condition. Wu said, "Your son is fine. This time you need to spend some money. Even going to college costs two or three thousand, so spending a little money for enlistment and job placement is nothing." A few days later, Wu accepted 700 yuan from the Zhao family in two installments. Later, Wu used the excuse that the three town quotas in Jiangnan Township were full and demanded another 500 yuan for a quota. After much negotiation, Wu accepted 200 yuan from the Zhao family. Similarly, Wu extorted 500 yuan from the Xu family under the pretense of helping Xu Mingzhu enlist in the army.

		Based on the facts of Wu Wenzhu's violation of party discipline and the law, the Ning'an County Party Committee decided to expel him from the party and recommended that the administrative department dismiss him from his post. The cash and gifts he extorted were all turned over to the finance department. The county people's court sentenced him to one year in prison with a two-year suspended sentence.

　　征兵居然也索贿        
    吴文柱贪赃受惩
    本报哈尔滨３月２６日电  记者武培真报道：黑龙江省纪委近日通报全省——宁安县江南乡武装部长吴文柱，乘征兵之机索贿受贿，受到党纪和法律制裁。
    吴文柱先后索要了１０多人的现款和礼物。宁安镇居民赵亚新要求当兵，找到吴文柱申请。吴当即答应，声明占农村名额，复员后不能安置。体检后，赵亚新父母向吴询问其子体检情况，吴说：“你孩子没毛病，这回该花点钱了。上大学也得花两三千，当兵回来安排工作花点钱算什么。”数日后，吴两次接受赵家现款７００元。后来，吴又以江南乡三个镇名额已满为借口，让赵家再拿５００元要一个名额。经双方再三讨价还价，吴又接受赵家的２００元钱。与此类似，吴借帮徐明珠当兵，向徐家勒索５００元。
    根据吴文柱违犯党纪国法的事实，宁安县委决定开除其党籍，建议行政部门开除其公职，对索贿受贿的现金和收受礼物的核款全部上交财政。县人民法院已依法将其判处有期徒刑一年、缓刑二年。
