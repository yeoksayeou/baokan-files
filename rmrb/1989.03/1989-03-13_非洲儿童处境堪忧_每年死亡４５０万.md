The United Nations Children's Fund recently released a report stating that 4.5 million children die each year in Africa. The economic decline, debt, natural disasters, environmental degradation, and South Africa's apartheid policy have made the future of African children bleak.

The report indicates that in 1987, one out of every five children died before reaching the age of five. In Angola and Mozambique, 140,000 children died before reaching the age of five. In these two countries, half of the health centers and one-third of the schools have been destroyed or abandoned.

Currently, 15 million children in Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Zambia are suffering from the impact of South Africa's apartheid policy.
