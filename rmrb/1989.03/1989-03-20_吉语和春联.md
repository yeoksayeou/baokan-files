Title: Auspicious Words and Spring Couplets

The Spring Festival has passed, and everyone has been busy for a while, mainly exchanging a few pleasant words and mutual congratulations. The wishes from last year and the year before were mostly "Congratulations on your wealth." This year, however, people seem to have cooled down a bit on the fervor for wealth, and the calls of "Congratulations on your wealth" are not as exciting as before. Is it that after a period of "high temperature," a cooling down is necessary to adjust, before another leap to a more rational peak? Let's not delve into that, but the phenomenon of the "wealth" fervor being lower this spring compared to previous years seems to be a reflection of public sentiment.

I recently read the Ming Dynasty work *Smiling History* by Feng Menglong, which records that during the Tang Dynasty, there was a county magistrate named Xiahou Biao in Xinchang County. As soon as he took office, he did two "big things": The first was to summon a few "li-zheng" (village heads) and ask, "How many eggs can you buy for one coin?" The village heads hurriedly replied, "Three for one coin." The magistrate then took out ten thousand copper coins and instructed the village heads to buy thirty thousand eggs, saying, "Don't rush to get the eggs; let the hens hatch them." A few months later, the thirty thousand eggs became thirty thousand chickens. The magistrate then ordered the chickens to be sold! Thus, the magistrate's pockets were comfortably filled with 300,000 coins. The second thing he did was to again summon the village heads and ask, "How many bamboo shoots can you buy for one coin?" The village heads replied, "Five for one coin." Xiahou Biao then took out ten thousand copper coins and told the village heads to buy fifty thousand bamboo shoots. He instructed them to plant the bamboo shoots in the ground. By autumn, the bamboo forest was dense, and one bamboo stalk sold for ten coins, again filling his pockets with 500,000 coins. Naturally, Magistrate Xiahou indeed had a year of "Congratulations on your wealth."

Ancient "official profiteering," due to the lack of modern measures, had no computers, information, banks, foreign exchange, airplanes, or trains, so they could only make a few hundred thousand coins by flipping chickens and bamboo shoots. Therefore, today, his ruthlessness seems like "child's play." Moreover, first, he still spent capital, and second, it at least benefited production.

However, the common people would never "congratulate" such "wealth." Therefore, how should "wealth" be pursued? Who should be the first to get rich? These questions should be carefully considered to avoid blindly "congratulating." Reflection is needed to calmly examine reality.

In the *Guisin Miscellaneous Records* by Zhou Mi of the early Yuan Dynasty, it is recorded that Huang Qianzhi, the education supervisor of Yanhai County, posted a couplet at his door during the Spring Festival:

	May the new year be auspicious in every way
	May all things be greatly prosperous

The phrases "how it is" and "just like that" were commonly used in the imperial edicts of the Yuan Dynasty. The couplet was originally quite realistic and not as exaggerated as typical couplets, but because this Huang supervisor imitated the "imperial" tone in his couplet, he was reported and dismissed from his post.

　　吉语和春联
    黄苗子
    春节过了，大家忙乱一阵，无非彼此说几句中听的话，互相祝贺。去年、前年的祝语，多是“恭喜发财”；今年，大家似乎对发财的狂热略减，“恭喜发财”的呼声不怎样令人兴奋了。是否在“高温”之后必然经过一次“冷却”来调整，然后才能再跃进到一个较不盲目的高潮？这且不去细说，但今年春节“发财”声浪比过去“降温”，这个现象却似乎是民意的温度表。
    偶读明代冯梦龙《笑府》，记载唐时有个叫夏侯彪之的新昌县令，他“下车伊始”，就干了两件“大事”：第一件是叫几个“里正”（保甲长）来问：“这里的鸡蛋一文钱买几个？”里正忙说：“一钱三个。”县太爷就拿出一万铜钱，叫里正买三万枚鸡蛋，并说：“不忙要蛋，你们都让母鸡孵去吧。”几个月后，三万鸡蛋变三万头鸡，县太爷又下令把鸡全卖掉！于是县太爷的口袋便舒舒服服装进了３０万。第二件又是找里正，问竹笋一文钱买几枚？里正答：“五枚。”夏侯老爷又拿出一万铜钱叫里正买五万枚竹笋。告诉里正，这竹笋他不忙吃，就让种在地中。到秋天竹林成片，一根竹卖价１０文钱，又把５０万钱进了口袋。自然，夏侯大人这一年，的确就“恭喜发财”了。
    古代“官倒”，由于缺乏现代化措施，电脑信息、银行外汇、飞机火车都没有，就只能赚三五十万个铜钱，倒来倒去也只有鸡和竹笋，因此今天看来，他的心狠手辣也只是“小儿科”。何况第一，他还花本钱，第二，总算有利于生产。
    然而，老百姓对于这种“发财”，是绝不“恭喜”的。所以，“发财”该怎样去发？“先富”的应是哪些人？都应当慎重反思，才不致于胡乱“恭喜”。反思，是要冷静地推敲一下现实。
    元初周密《癸辛杂识》续集中，记盐官县学教谕黄谦之，过年时门口贴了一副春联：
    宜入新年怎生呵
    百事大吉那般者原来“怎生呵”、“那般者”都是元代皇帝谕旨中常用的白话字眼，大意是“怎么咧”和“就是了”。这副对联本来还算实事求是，不像一般春联那么刮浮夸风，可是由于这位黄教谕在春联上摹仿“圣上”的口气，被人告了一状，给罢了官。
