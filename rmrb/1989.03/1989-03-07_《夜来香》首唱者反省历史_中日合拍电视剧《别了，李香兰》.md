The singer of "Night Fragrance," the star of film and song during the Japanese puppet regime, Li Xianglan, is now known as Ōtori Yoshiko, a member of the Japanese Diet. She collaborated with Mr. Fujisawa Yomi to write her autobiography, "Li Xianglan: My First Half of Life." In the book, she reflects on her past service to the Japanese military and puppet government during the invasion of China and expresses her hope to educate Japanese youth with her experiences, contributing to Sino-Japanese friendship.

Based on this book, a six-episode TV series titled "Farewell, Li Xianglan" will be co-produced by the China International Television Drama Co. and Japan's Fuji Television. The signing ceremony for the co-production was held recently at the Beijing headquarters of China Central Television.

The series is expected to be completed by September.
