Currently, recognizing Chinese cuisine from the perspective of "culinary culture" has become a shared understanding within China's cultural and scientific communities. Since 1984, this topic has sparked heated discussions and gradually formed the following four viewpoints:

Firstly, there is the culinary culture theory. The core of this viewpoint is that Chinese cuisine not only provides rich nutrition and adheres to scientific principles but also possesses a high degree of artistic value. Since it spans both science and art, it is summarized as culinary culture.

Secondly, there is the culinary art theory. This viewpoint, which has gained traction in recent years, emphasizes that Chinese cuisine is a form of artistic creation. Consequently, many dishes and snacks overly emphasize arrangement and form, falling into the trap of being mere craft artworks.

Thirdly, there is the culinary technology theory, which opposes the second viewpoint (the art theory). This viewpoint argues that "although culinary arts are related to disciplines such as literature, science, and art, they fundamentally belong to the realm of craft technology."

Lastly, there is the culinary science theory. This viewpoint posits that culinary science is a very broad field, encompassing the scientific process of food preparation and manufacturing. It can include all food processing activities, naturally encompassing the food industry, and its artistic value is proposed from an aesthetic perspective.

　　怎样看待烹饪文化
    目前，从“烹饪文化”的高度认识中国烹饪，已是中国文化界和科技界的共同认识，并从１９８４年以来，引起了热烈的讨论，渐渐形成了以下四派意见：
    首先，是烹饪文化论。这种意见的核心是，中国烹饪的菜肴不仅有丰富的营养，符合科学规律，而且有高度的艺术性。因为其横跨科学和艺术两大门类，就以烹饪文化概括之。
    其次，是烹饪艺术论。这种意见是近几年滋长起来的，强调中国烹饪是造形的艺术。于是，很多菜点过于讲究拼摆和造形，流于工艺美术制品的窠臼。
    再次，是对第二种意见（即艺术论）持否定态度的烹调技术论。这种意见认为，“烹饪尽管是与文、理、艺等学科有联系的综合性文化，但本质上仍属于工艺技术”。
    最后，是烹饪科学论。这种观点认为，烹饪学是范围十分广泛的科学，烹饪是食物加工制作过程的科学，几乎可以包括所有的食品加工活动，当然也包括食品工业，而其艺术性也是从美学角度提出的。
