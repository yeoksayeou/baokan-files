**Discussion on Agricultural Development Issues**

Due to the stagnation of grain production over four years, some people have doubts about whether the household contract responsibility system can continue to drive agricultural growth. They consciously or unconsciously propose various measures to withdraw farmers' management autonomy and revert to the old methods of a planned economy. Chen Xiwen believes this is very harmful. In the face of difficulties, we should seek new methods and steadfastly, stabilize, and improve the household contract responsibility system.

**Clarify Several Agricultural Growth Policies as Soon as Possible**

Chen Xiwen

Farmers, in order to compensate for the losses caused by the significant price increases of industrial products, will inevitably choose to expand the production of agricultural products with even higher price increases. In an economically tight and credit-restricted environment, to maintain income growth, farmers often try to invest their funds in industries and products with higher returns. Although this may bring new momentum to the growth of certain economic crops, as well as meat, poultry, eggs, vegetables, fruits, and aquatic products, it will also place grain, cotton, and oil, and other major agricultural products in an even more unfavorable position. However, grain, cotton, and oil, as basic products, play a crucial role in the stability of the entire national economy. If the total production of grain, cotton, and oil cannot be increased in the next two years, the plans to curb inflation and improve the economic environment will be difficult to implement. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify several basic agricultural policies for the next period.

1. **Adhere to the Basic Policy of Stabilizing the Household Contract Responsibility System.** The household contract responsibility system is one of the most fundamental achievements of the past decade of rural reforms and is also one of the most important growth points for the development of the new rural economic system. Therefore, stabilizing the household contract responsibility system should and must be one of China's long-term basic policies. However, in recent times, due to the fluctuation of grain and other production over the years, some comrades have begun to doubt whether the household contract responsibility system can continue to drive agricultural growth. They consciously or unconsciously propose various measures to withdraw farmers' management autonomy and revert to the old methods of a planned economy, preparing to resume the old practice of the government replacing farmers in farming. These proposals are very harmful to both reform and economic development. In the face of difficulties, we should seek new methods and not revert to old methods that have been proven to harm farmers. It is necessary to adhere to, stabilize, and improve the household contract responsibility system, which will be the basis for formulating various rural economic policies for a long period to come.

2. **Adhere to the Policy of Protecting Stable Agricultural Growth.** Due to limited resources and insufficient investment in the previous stage, agricultural growth cannot be very rapid in the next three to five years. For a period, it is necessary to create a stable environment for normal agricultural growth from two aspects. First, create a stable relationship between supply and demand for agricultural products to avoid artificially causing abnormal demand growth that disrupts the stability of agricultural production capacity. Currently, it is particularly important to take strict and effective measures to crack down on behaviors such as using public funds to waste food and monopolizing scarce agricultural industrial raw materials to seek high profits through administrative means, thereby reducing the impact of false market information brought by ineffective demand on farmers as much as possible. Second, starting from now, take reliable measures to ensure that investment in agriculture, including agricultural-related industries, has a certain growth rate. Otherwise, the delayed effect of infrastructure investment will seriously affect the stability of agricultural growth in the 1990s.

3. **Policy to Improve Agricultural Trade Conditions.** To create an environment conducive to stable agricultural growth, it is important to make agricultural operators feel that additional investment in agriculture is profitable. This requires that the relative prices of agricultural products can be gradually increased through various means. On the one hand, this should be achieved by gradually expanding the proportion of agricultural products traded based on market supply and demand; on the other hand, it should be guaranteed by establishing a stable price ratio between agricultural products and agricultural inputs. In the absence of sufficient financial capacity to significantly increase the purchase prices of agricultural products, it is necessary to appropriately expand the barter of agricultural products and agricultural inputs, because this can curb the arbitrary price increases of agricultural inputs, reduce the impact of inflation on the sales of agricultural products, and thus protect the legitimate interests of farmers. Of course, the fundamental solution is to focus on improving the economic benefits of urban industrial and commercial enterprises, enhancing their ability to absorb price increases, avoiding the return to the original price ratio during the price reform process, and thus preventing the further deterioration of agricultural trade conditions.

4. **Implement Clear Fiscal Protection Policies for Agriculture, Especially Planting Industries.** Due to well-known reasons, even after introducing more market regulation mechanisms in agricultural product trade, agriculture is difficult to fundamentally change its disadvantageous position of relatively low comparative benefits. Therefore, the government needs to implement clear fiscal protection policies for agriculture, which mainly should be reflected in: first, having clear institutions to guarantee the supply of fiscal funds for long-term investment in agriculture, and at the same time, using effective income redistribution means to enhance agriculture's ability to attract social funds; second, improving the government's ability to stabilize the supply and demand market fluctuations of agricultural products, and sharing as much as possible the market risks faced by agricultural operators; third, clearly undertaking the responsibility of investing in human capital and technological reserves for agriculture, to ensure the continuous improvement of agricultural productivity and the realization of agricultural modernization goals.

5. **Use Relatively Preferential Economic Policies to Guide the Improvement of the Degree of Organization of Rural Micro-Economy.** On the basis of implementing household operations, the introduction of market mechanisms objectively requires the gradual formation of agricultural infrastructure (including circulation facilities) and investment subjects beyond the household level, so as to improve the ability of agricultural operations to withstand natural and market risks. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate relatively preferential policies on the basis of clarifying property rights, so that rural micro-economic organizations with public assets beyond the household can develop more rapidly. This will have practical significance in increasing agricultural investment, developing the agricultural product market, and ensuring market stability.

　　怎样突破徘徊？
    农业发展问题讨论
    由于粮食四年徘徊，有人怀疑家庭联产承包制继续使农业增长的潜力，自觉不自觉提出种种收回农民经营自主权，回复统制经济老办法的主张。陈锡文认为，这十分有害。在困难面前，应该寻找新办法，坚持、稳定和完善家庭联产承包制。
    尽快明确农业增长的几项政策
　　陈锡文
    农民为了弥补工业品价格大幅度上涨给他们带来的损失，必然要选择价格上涨幅度更大的农产品扩大生产；在经济紧缩、银根收紧的情况下，为了保持收入增长，农民往往会尽可能地将资金用于收益高的产业和产品。这虽然会给某些经济作物，以及肉、禽、蛋、菜、水果、水产等副食品生产的增长带来新动力，但同时也会使粮、棉、油等大宗农产品生产陷于更为不利的地位。而粮、棉、油等作为基础产品，对整个国民经济的稳定具有举足轻重的作用，如不能确保今、明两年粮、棉、油的总产量有所增长，抑制通货膨胀、治理经济环境的设想将很难真正落实。为此，必须尽快明确今后一段时期内的若干农业基本政策。
    一、坚持稳定家庭联产承包责任制的基本政策。家庭联产承包制，是１０年农村改革的最基本成果之一，也是发育农村新经济体制的最重要生长点之一。因此，稳定家庭联产承包制，应当而且必须作为我国农村长期不变的基本政策之一。但是，近一段时期以来，由于粮食等产量连年波动不前，有些同志开始对家庭联产承包制继续使农业增长的潜力产生了怀疑，自觉不自觉地提出了种种收回农民经营自主权，回复统制经济老办法的主张，准备重操改革前政府替代农民种地的旧业。这些主张，无论对改革还是对经济的发展，都是十分有害的。在困难面前，应当寻找新办法，而决不能回过头重拣已被实践证明是伤害农民的老办法。必须坚持、稳定和完善家庭联产承包制，将是今后很长一段时期中，制定各类农村经济政策的基点。
    二、坚持保护农业稳定增长的政策。由于资源有限和前一阶段的投资不足，在今后三五年内，农业的增长不可能有很高的速度。在一段时期内，应当从两方面为农业正常增长创造稳定环境。一是要创造农产品供求之间的稳定关系，避免人为造成的需求不正常增长而破坏农业生产能力的稳定性。在当前，尤其要采取严厉而有效的手段，制裁用公款挥霍、浪费食品、靠行政手段垄断紧缺农产工业原料以牟高利等行为，从而使无效需求带给农民的虚假市场信息的作用，尽量降低。二是从现在开始，采取可靠措施，保证对农业，包括对农用工业的投资有一定幅度的增长。否则就会因基础设施投资效益的滞后性，而严重影响９０年代农业增长的稳定性。
    三、改善农产品贸易条件的政策。创造有利于农业稳定增长的环境，重要的是必须使农业经营者感到对农业追加投入，确实有利可图。这就要求农产品的相对价格，能够通过各种形式在实际上逐步有所提高。这一方面要通过逐步扩大按市场供求调节购销农产品的比重来实现；另一方面要靠建立稳定的农产品和农业投入品之间的比价关系来保障。在国家缺乏大幅度提高农产品购价的财力条件下，适当扩大农产品与农业投入品之间的实物交换是必要的，因为这样可以抑制农业投入品的随意涨价，使农产品的销售少受通货膨胀的影响，从而保护农民应有的利益。当然，最根本的还是要着力于提高城市工商企业的经济效益，使它们增强对物价上涨的消化能力，才能避免价格改革过程中比价复归局面形成，从而防止农产品贸易条件被进一步恶化。
    四、对农业，尤其是种植业，要实行明确的财政保护政策。由于众所周知的特殊性，农业即使在农产品贸易中引入较多的市场调节机制后，也是难以从根本上改变其比较利益较低的不利地位的。这就需要政府对农业实行明确的财政保护政策，其主要应体现在：一、要有明确的制度，以保障对农业长期投资的财政资金的供给，同时要以有效的收入再分配手段，增强农业对社会资金的吸引能力；二、提高政府自身对农产品供求市场波动的平抑能力，尽可能地分担农业经营者面临的市场风险；三、要明确地承担起对农业进行人力资本投资和科技储备投资的责任，以保证农业生产力水平的持续提高和农业现代化目标的实现。
    五、以相对优惠的经济政策，引导农村微观经济组织化程度的提高。在实行家庭经营的基础上引入市场机制，客观上要求农村逐步形成超越家庭层次的农业基础设施（包括流通设施）、投资主体，这样才能提高农业经营等对自然和市场风险的承受能力。因此，必须在明确产权关系的基础上，制定相对优惠的政策，使超越家庭的公共资产的农村微观经济组织能得到更迅速的发展。这将对增加农业投入，对农产品市场的发育和保证市场的稳定具有实际意义的作用。
