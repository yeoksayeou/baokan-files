A young girl with a severe head injury, her eyes crossed and expression vacant, seems to be seeking help. This picture (see illustration) appeared multiple times in France last year on billboards, television screens, and newspapers. The touching image stirred a massive social response, awakening countless French people to the plight of the disabled. It was this picture that prompted the French National Assembly to amend laws related to the disabled in January, thereby bringing hope and confidence to the disabled.

French law stipulates that the government provides special facilities only for disabled minors. Once they reach adulthood, they must return home to be cared for by their parents. However, ordinary families lack the means and basic training to care for the disabled, encountering numerous difficulties and problems. If the parents pass away, the only option for the disabled is to be sent to a mental hospital, where they must live with mentally ill patients under the threat of violence for the rest of their lives. This is tantamount to sentencing them to life imprisonment or even death. The amended law stipulates that the government must take care of adult disabled individuals, and if necessary, without age restrictions, support them until old age.

The advocate for this movement to improve the welfare of disabled people in France is the famous actor Michel Crete. For decades, he has been tirelessly and relentlessly advocating for the cause of the disabled.

Crete had a talent for performing from a young age and was admitted to an acting school during his high school years. One day, he saw a woman crying on the side of the road and went up to ask what had happened. She replied, "Just now, a passerby pointed at my disabled child and said, 'You'd better hide such a child at home and not take him out!'" This young student was deeply moved by her words, and his heart was filled with sympathy. He decided to help this woman and her family. From then on, he maintained close contact with this family and later became the godfather of this disabled child. He gradually realized that the emotional burden borne by the parents of disabled children was extraordinary.

Crete has participated in five marathon races in New York City. Once, he saw a man with paralyzed lower limbs using his arms to vigorously push his wheelchair, competing with strong and healthy athletes. The crowd on both sides of the street cheered and applauded for this disabled person, as did the athletes competing with him. This touching scene left a deep impression on Crete and gave him the strength to fight for the cause of the disabled.

After the publication of the "1975 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons," Crete often read the fourth clause to people he met: "Disabled persons should enjoy the same civil and political rights as other persons." His unremitting efforts yielded gratifying results. Over ten thousand letters poured in like snowflakes, some offering moral support, some providing material assistance, and some generously donating their land and houses. The media provided him with 500 advertising spaces, 35 television advertisements, and 135 pages of newspaper space free of charge. The promotional picture mentioned at the beginning of this article is one of the important activities carried out.

Although the French Parliament has amended the laws related to the disabled, Crete has not stopped his efforts. He continues to strive to ensure that adult disabled individuals can be properly placed as soon as possible.

　　孜孜不倦数十载克里特奔走呼吁：
    多给残疾人以温暖
    一位脑部受过重伤的小姑娘，两眼斜视，表情呆滞，好像在寻求帮助。这幅画（见图）去年多次出现在法国各地的广告栏里、电视屏幕和报纸上。感人的画激起了巨大的社会反响，唤醒了无数法国人对残疾人的怜悯。就是这张画促使法国国民议会于今年一月修改了有关残疾人的法律，从而给残疾人带来了信心和希望。
    法国法律规定，政府只为未成年残疾人提供专门场所。成年后，他们必须回到自己家里，由家长照料。而一般家庭缺乏护理残疾人的手段和基本训练，碰到不少麻烦和问题。如果家长去世，残疾人的唯一去处就是被送进精神病院。与精神病人同处一室，在暴力的威胁中度过一生。这无异于判处他们无期徒刑或死刑。修改后的法律规定，成年残疾人必须得到政府照顾，如有必要不受年龄限制，一直养到老。
    这场为法国残疾人谋幸福的运动倡导者是著名演员米歇尔·克里特。几十年来，他坚韧不拔，竭尽全力地为残疾人事业奔走呼号。
    克里特从小具有表演天赋，中学时就考进了培养演员的学校。一天，他看见一位妇女在路边哭泣，上前问有何不幸。她回答说，刚才一个路人指着她那有残疾的孩子说：“你最好把这样的孩子藏在家里，不要带他出门！”这位年青学生听后心绪难平，同情心油然而生，决心资助这位妇女和她的家庭。自此以后，他同这个家庭保持着密切联系，后来克里特做了这个残疾儿童的教父。他逐渐领悟到，残疾儿童的父母所承受的感情重负竟非同寻常。
    克里特曾到美国纽约市参加过五次马拉松赛跑。有一次，他看见一个下肢瘫痪的男子坐轮椅用胳膊奋力摇着轮子在同身强力壮的运动员角逐着。为这位残疾人加油和喝采的不但有街道两边的热情观众，而且还有同他比赛的运动员。这动人的场面深深印在克里特的脑海里，也给了他为残疾人事业奋斗的力量。
    《一九七五年联合国残疾人权利宣言》发表后，为了唤起人们关心残疾人的权利，克里特经常向遇到的人宣读其中的第四款：“残疾人应享有同其他人一样的公民权利和政治权利。”他不懈的努力获得了可喜的成果。十万多封来信雪片似地向他飞来，有人送来道义支持，有人给予物质援助，有人慷慨解囊，捐出自己的土地和房屋。新闻媒介向他无偿提供了五百个广告栏、三十五次电视广告和一百三十五页报纸版面，本文开头提及的宣传画就是开展的一项重要活动。
    法国议会虽然修改了有关残疾人的法律，但克里特并没有就此止步。他还在继续努力，以便使成年残疾人早日得到真正的妥善安置。
