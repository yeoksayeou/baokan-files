    Yu Kuohua Insists on One-China Stance and Promotes "Taiwan Experience" Against "One Country, Two Systems"

    Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, March 1 - Taipei News: On February 28, Taiwan's "Premier" Yu Kuohua delivered a policy report during the 83rd session of the "Legislative Yuan," stating that the Taiwan authorities will adhere to the "One-China stance" but also claiming to promote the "Taiwan experience" to "achieve the goal of Chinese reunification."

    Yu Kuohua's policy report stated that the Taiwan authorities "defend the One-China stance, the mainland is part of China, and Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu are also part of China. Any proposal to split the territory is against national justice and is an unrealistic fantasy that will be condemned by the entire nation."

    In his report, Yu Kuohua also mentioned that since November of the previous year, the Taiwan authorities have allowed citizens to visit the mainland, followed by permitting mainland compatriots to visit Taiwan for medical reasons and funerals, agreeing to allow Taiwanese civilian organizations to participate in international conferences and cultural and sports activities held by the mainland, accepting mainland students to visit Taiwan, assisting in communication between people on both sides through the Red Cross, and opening up indirect imports of mainland agricultural and industrial raw materials. He also mentioned allowing former Nationalist Party soldiers stranded in the mainland to return to Taiwan to settle. He claimed that these measures are to "further use the Taiwan experience as a blueprint to achieve the goal of Chinese reunification." Yu Kuohua also expressed opposition to the "One Country, Two Systems" policy.

    鼓吹“台湾经验”反对“一国两制”
    新华社香港3月1日电  台北消息：台湾“行政院长”俞国华2月28日在台湾“立法院”第83会期开议时作施政报告，表示台湾当局将坚持“一个中国的立场”，但又声称要以推广“台湾经验”来“实现中国统一的目标”。
    俞国华的施政报告说，台湾当局“坚守一个中国的立场，大陆是中国的一部分，台澎金马也是中国的一部分，任何分裂国土的主张都是违反民族大义和不切实际的幻想，必将受到全民的唾弃”。
    俞国华在报告中还提到台湾当局从前年11月起开放民众赴大陆探亲，接着允许大陆同胞到台湾探病和奔丧，同意台湾民间团体到大陆参加国际组织召开的会议和文化、体育活动，接受大陆留学生到台参观访问，经由红十字会的协助让两岸人民通信，以及开放大陆农工原料间接进口，并将允许滞留大陆的前台籍国民党军人返台定居等。他声称，这些作法是为了“进一步以台湾经验为蓝本，实现中国统一的目标”。俞国华同时表示反对“一国两制”。
