The U.S. today expelled a Soviet diplomat, accusing him of espionage activities. The U.S. State Department announced that Yuri Patusov, a deputy military attaché at the Soviet Embassy in the U.S., was expelled for attempting to obtain information on how the U.S. government protects secrets in computer systems.

An FBI spokesman said Patusov was arrested at 9:25 a.m. on March 8 while receiving classified documents from an employee of a U.S. company that has a secret contract with the U.S. government. Due to his diplomatic immunity, Patusov has returned to the Soviet Embassy.

State Department spokesman Redman said Patusov was ordered to leave the country for "engaging in activities inconsistent with his diplomatic status."

A spokesman for the Soviet Embassy called the expulsion a "deliberate provocation against Soviet diplomats" and protested the U.S. order.

　　美驱逐苏一名外交官
    指控他从事间谍活动
    本报华盛顿３月９日电  记者仓立德报道：美国国务院今天以从事间谍活动为由，宣布驱逐苏联驻美使馆助理武官尤里·帕图索夫中校，罪名是企图获得有关美国政府如何在电脑系统中保护机密的资料。
    美国联邦调查局一位发言人说，帕图索夫是８日上午９时２５分被捕的，当时他从一位美国公司雇员那里接受了机密文件。该公司与美国政府有秘密合同。因具有外交豁免权，帕图索夫已回到苏联使馆。
    国务院发言人雷德曼说，帕图索夫是因“从事与其外交身份不相符的活动”被命令出境的。
    苏联使馆发言人说，这是“对苏联外交官的蓄意挑衅”，并对美国的驱逐令提出抗议。
