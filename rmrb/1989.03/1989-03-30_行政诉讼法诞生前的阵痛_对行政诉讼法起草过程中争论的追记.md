The pains of childbirth before the birth of the Administrative Litigation Law
——A retrospective on the debates during the drafting of the Administrative Litigation Law

By Xiao Du, Reporter of this newspaper

The birth of any new thing requires gestation and the pains of childbirth. How much more so for the Administrative Litigation Law, which is a new chapter in China's legislative process!

When the Administrative Litigation Law was submitted to the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress for deliberation, it attracted keen attention from all quarters within and outside the Congress. In this regard, the reporter interviewed several comrades who had participated in the drafting, discussion, and revision of the Administrative Litigation Law, including Guo Angran, Vice Chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. They told the reporter that when the draft of the Administrative Litigation Law was submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for discussion, there were heated debates on some major issues. These debates were also quite interesting. Through discussions and debates, a consensus was reached, deepening our understanding of legislation and providing valuable experience for future legislative and law enforcement work.

The formulation of the Administrative Litigation Law, like other legislation, requires reference to some foreign materials, but it mainly considers our national conditions. Our legislative purpose is not just to handle a few cases, but to achieve a check on power by power. Regarding the current wording in the text, "guaranteeing and supervising administrative organs in the exercise of administrative power," there were initially some differing opinions. Some people thought that proposing "promoting" would suffice, and that "supervision" might not necessarily be written in this way. After the debate, many comrades felt that since it is allowed for the "people" to sue the "officials," it is allowed for the masses to supervise the government, and it is also allowed to implement judicial supervision over administrative organs. Why not boldly write the word "supervision"? The significance of legislation lies in having both guarantees and supervision, which can help administrative organs perform their management functions.

The scope of acceptance is also a focal point of debate. From the perspective of the "people," the demand is broad: whenever the interests of citizens are harmed, they can go to court to sue. Some even said that in foreign countries, if someone falls off a bicycle, they can sue the government agency for not maintaining the road properly. However, after in-depth research and discussion in connection with China's current national conditions, many comrades realized that a too broad scope of acceptance is not feasible today. This is not just a matter of ideology but also of actual capacity to bear the burden. As a populous country, the scope of acceptance should have clear limitations, which is now stipulated in the draft as eight aspects. In terms of the level of trial, it is uniformly stipulated that basic-level courts shall handle the cases, regardless of the level at which the cases occur.

The terminology for parties to the lawsuit also underwent heated debate. Initially, some comrades in the discussion thought that "plaintiff" and "defendant" were not appropriate. How could the legal representative of a government agency become a "defendant"? Some comrades also said that in foreign countries, the terminology for parties to civil and criminal lawsuits is different. Thus, in last year's draft, the terms "plaintiff" and "defendant" appeared. In the discussion by the Standing Committee and the drafters in January this year, after research and deliberation, it was felt that China's Criminal Law, General Principles of Civil Law, and other texts all use the terms "plaintiff" and "defendant." Everyone also discussed that whether it is a "plaintiff" or a "defendant," it is just a term for parties to the lawsuit. The final judgment will be based on facts and in accordance with the law. The current terminology in the text embodies the principle of equality before the law.

Regarding the use of the power to alter administrative cases, it is to better protect the lawful rights and interests of citizens and fully demonstrate the justice of the law. Its result helps to enhance the prestige of the government. This aspect, not only in the legislative process through discussions to recognize, but also in the past few years of handling administrative cases experience accumulation. For example, last year, more than 8,000 administrative cases were handled nationwide, nearly 2,000 were revoked or partially revoked, and nearly 1,000 were altered.

The birth of the Administrative Litigation Law has prompted government departments to strengthen legislative work and improve the level of administrative management and law enforcement. Starting from 1986, the drafting process went through multiple discussions until the legislative draft was promulgated in November 1988. Many people's legal awareness has been enhanced, and their concepts have been updated, reflecting the progress of China's democratic and legal construction.

　　行政诉讼法诞生前的阵痛        
    ——对行政诉讼法起草过程中争论的追记
    本报记者  晓渡
    任何新事物的诞生，都是要经过孕育，经过临产的阵痛，何况行政诉讼法是我国立法进程中崭新的一页呢！
    当行政诉讼法提交七届全国人民代表大会二次会议审议时，引起了会内外各方面的热切关注。记者为此访问了曾参加行政诉讼法起草、讨论和修改的全国人大常委会法制工作委员会副主任顾昂然等有关同志。他们告诉记者，在行政诉讼法草案提交人大常委会讨论时，在一些主要问题上，争论是很热烈的，也是很有意思的。通过切磋、争论，然后达到统一认识，使我们对立法的认识加深了，也为今后立法和执法工作提供了有益经验。
    制定行政诉讼法，同其他立法一样，要参照国外的一些资料，但主要还要考虑我们的国情。我们立法的目的，不是光从处理几个案件的要求出发，而是权力对权力的制约。对于现在文本中“保障和监督行政机关依法行使行政权力”的提法，开始是有些不同意见的，认为提出“促进”就可以了，“监督”似不一定这么写。经过争论，许多同志认为，既然允许“民”告“官”，就是允许群众监督政府，也是允许对行政机关实行司法监督，那么为什么不大大方方地写上“监督”二字呢？立法的意义就在有保障，也有监督，才能有助于行政机关发挥管理职能。
    受案范围也是个争论的重点，作为“民”的想法，要求宽，凡是公民利益受到损害，都可以到法院去告。有人甚至说，在国外骑自行车摔倒了，也可以去控告政府机关没把路修好。但经过深入地、联系我国今日国情的研究讨论，许多同志认识到，受案范围太宽，今天做不到，这里不仅是个观念问题，还有个实际承受能力问题。作为一个人口众多的大国，受案范围应有明确限制，也就是现在草案中规定的八个方面。受案审级上，也统一由基层法院审理，不论它是发生在哪一级的案件。
    诉讼参加人的提法，也经过热烈的争论。开始一些同志在讨论中认为“原告”和“被告”不好，政府机关的法人代表，怎么成了“被告”？也有的同志说，在国外民事和刑事的诉讼参加人的称谓就不一样。于是，在去年的草稿中，就出现了“起诉人”和“被诉人”的称谓。在今年１月人大常委讨论时，常委们和起草人经过研究和推敲，认为我国的刑法、民法通则等文本，都是用“原告”和“被告”的称谓。大家还谈论说，无论是“原告”或“被告”，只是诉讼参加人的称谓，最后决定判处，都要以事实为根据，以法律为准绳。现在文本中的称谓，正体现了法律面前人人平等。
    对于行政案件使用变更权，也是为了更好地保护公民的合法权利，充分显示法律的公正，它的结果，有助于提高政府的威信。这一方面，不仅是在立法过程中，通过讨论来认识的，也是近几年来处理行政案件经验的积累。如去年全国处理了８０００余件行政案件，撤销和部分撤销的近两千件，其中变更的近千件。
    行政诉讼法的产生，促使政府部门加强立法工作，提高行政管理的执法水平。从１９８６年开始起草，到１９８８年１１月公布立法草案，经过多次讨论，许多人法制意识在增强，观念在更新，体现了我国民主与法制建设在向前推进。
