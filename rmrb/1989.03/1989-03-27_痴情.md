Title: Obsessive Love

We still do not have a single red leaf that is obsessively in love.
Our hearts have withered,
No longer vibrant,
No longer attentive in the rustling autumn breeze,
No longer using warm lips
To shyly reunite after parting.
We still do not have a single mountain path that is obsessively in love,
To take the sun and ignite the midday fire,
To invite orchids to bloom
On the days of waiting.
We have already learned to part,
Casually cutting memories into threads,
Not pasting them on the white paper walls,
Not sewing them into the soles of boots or scarves.
We no longer make vows,
No longer remind each other.
We still do not have a single folk song that is obsessively in love,
Quietly covering the eyes of eighteen-year-olds.
We no longer cover our faces,
No longer steal glances,
No longer search for a patch of blue sky to sing about ourselves.
Dear person, oh person,
Twenty years later on the Double Ninth Festival,
Will we two still
Like a winding path,
Walk emotionally to the mountain top?

　　痴情
    我们还没有一片红叶痴情
    心枯萎了
    就不再鲜艳
    不再在秋风瑟瑟响着的时候凝神
    不再用温暖的唇
    羞涩以后的相聚
    我们还没有一条山路痴情
    取太阳点燃白日炊火
    邀兰花花
    开满守望的日期
    我们已经学会了别离
    随手就把回忆剪成丝缕
    不贴在雪白的纸墙上
    不缝在　套鞋底和围巾里
    我们已不再发誓
    不再叮咛
    我们还没有一首民谣痴情
    悄悄地覆盖十八岁的眼睛
    我们已不再掩面
    不再偷看
    不再寻找一片蔚蓝的天哼唱自己　
    亲爱的人呵　人呵
    二十年后的重阳节
    我俩还会不会
    像弯弯的小路
    一直动情地走到山顶
