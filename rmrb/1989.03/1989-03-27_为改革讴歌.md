	Ode to Reform

	Guizhou worker-writer Lü Maoting published a collection of reportage literature titled "Echoes of Reform" (Guizhou People's Publishing House) and asked me to write a preface. Although my work is busy, I accepted his request.

	Firstly, the publication of this collection fills a gap in our province's literary publications, as there has not yet been a collection of reportage literature published. Secondly, this is a collection of reportage literature by a worker-amateur author. Thirdly, the works selected for this collection mostly reflect the reform and sing the praises of the reformers, serving as both a record of the times and an echo of the times.

	Maoting entered the factory during his youth. He has worked as a worker, a youth league cadre, and a propaganda cadre in a steel plant, never leaving the factory. He has a very close relationship with the worker masses and grassroots cadres and understands them deeply. Most of his works are either about industrial themes or depict the lives of workers. The reform's gradual deepening in the factories has touched the lives of many cadres and workers, indeed a revolution. Witnessing and experiencing it firsthand, Maoting's creative passion burst forth, and he devoted all his spare time to creating reportage literature that reflects the reform era and sings the praises of reformers. He not only writes himself but also, with the support of the Guiyang City Workers' Cultural Palace, the Guiyang City Federation of Trade Unions, and the Guizhou Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, organized dozens of worker-amateur authors to form the Guiyang City Workers' Cultural Palace Workers' Reportage Literature Group. Their sense of political responsibility and creative passion deeply moved me, inspiring me. Sometimes, I also find ways to squeeze out time to go to the factories, sit down with the workers, and listen to the high-level discussions of the reformers.

	This collection, titled "Echoes of Reform," selects a portion of the author's reportage literature created from 1982 to 1988. Even from this small portion of works, one can see that the author's creative pen touches various aspects of the reform period, including reflections on factories, research institutions, and ordinary families. The protagonists in these works include well-known reformers from Guizhou, scholarly intellectuals, men, women, Miao women heroes, and new stars in the literary and artistic circles. These works closely follow the pulse of the times, reflecting the struggles, creations, setbacks, victories, and joys and sorrows of the reformers in the great tide of reform. The author's thoughts and pen move in tandem with the reformers' reforms, lives, and work, sometimes singing passionately, sometimes lashing out in indignation, sometimes narrating emotionally, and sometimes speaking heavily. The entire collection is filled with a vigorous, unyielding forward momentum. Through reflecting the struggles of the reformers during the reform period, the author reflects the immense changes that reform has brought to the entire society, telling us that reform is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, conforms to China's national conditions and the laws of historical development. Reform will ultimately achieve victory.

	This collection can be said to be a small snapshot of Guizhou's 10 years of reform, as well as a small record of the times. In 10 years, 20 years, or 50 years, when people want to recall the life on this piece of Chinese land in the 1980s, they will find some clues in this collection.

### 为改革讴歌

　　为改革讴歌
    贵州工人作家吕茂廷同志出版报告文学集《改革的回声》（贵州人民出版社），要我给他写序言，虽然我的工作较忙，还是接受了他的要求。
    首先，由于这个集子的问世，填补了我省文学出版物中还没有结集出版报告文学的空白；第二，这是一位工人业余作者的报告文学集；第三，选编进这个集子里的作品，大都反映了改革，讴歌了改革者，既是时代的记录，也是时代的回声。
    茂廷青年时期就进了工厂。在钢铁厂当过工人、共青团干部、宣传干部，始终没有离开过工厂。他同工人群众与基层干部的关系十分密切，对他们特别了解。他的作品，绝大多数都是选取工业题材或者写职工群众生活的。改革在工厂的逐步深入，触及到广大干部和工人，确实是一场革命。耳闻目睹，亲身经历，使茂廷的创作热情一下子喷发出来了，他把自己的业余时间全部投入反映改革的时代，讴歌改革者的报告文学的创作中。他不但自己采写，而且在贵阳市工人文化宫、贵阳市总工会、贵州省总工会的支持下，把几十位职工业余作者组织起来，成立了贵阳市工人文化宫职工报告文学组。他们的政治责任感和创作热情深深感动了我，激励着我，有时我也想方设法挤出时间，下到工厂，同职工同志座谈，听取改革家们的高论。
    这本取名为《改革的回声》的报告文学集，选编了作者１９８２年至１９８８年创作的大量报告文学中的一部分。仅从这极少的一部分作品里，也可以看出作者的创作笔触所涉及到改革时期的各方面，既有反映工厂的，也有反映科研单位的，还有反映普通家庭的。这些作品里的主人翁，既有贵州知名的开拓创新的改革家，也有书生气十足的知识分子，既有男性，又有妇女；既有苗家女功臣，又有文学艺术队伍里的新星……这些作品紧扣时代的脉搏，反映改革大潮中的弄潮儿们奋进、创造、失意、胜利以及他们的喜怒哀乐。作者的思潮和笔墨同改革家们改革、生活、工作一道起伏跌宕，时而热情奔放地讴歌，时而愤世嫉俗地鞭挞，时而娓娓动人地抒情，时而心情沉重地诉说……整个集子中的作品都洋溢着一股勃勃向上、奋进不息的前进力量。作者通过反映改革时期中的改革家们的斗争生活，反映改革给全社会带来的巨大变化，告诉我们，改革是深得民心的，是符合中国国情和历史发展规律的。改革最终一定会取得胜利。
    这本集子可以说是贵州１０年改革的一个小小的缩影，也是一本小小的时代记录。再过１０年、２０年、５０年，当人们要回忆８０年代中国这块土地上的那段生活时，他们会从这本集子里找到一些线索。
