	Serious Riots Occur in Lhasa
	Some Separatist Elements Rampantly Smash, Loot, Burn, and Shoot
	Police Officers Forced to Take Decisive Measures to Control the Situation

	Xinhua News Agency, Central People's Broadcasting Station, and People's Daily reporters in Lhasa jointly report: Yesterday, a few separatist elements deliberately created a serious riot in Lhasa. They smashed, looted, burned, and shot at some government agencies and shops, and openly fired at police and armed police.

	Yesterday at noon, 13 monks and nuns, carrying "Tibet Independence" banners, marched along Barkhor Street. By the second lap, the number of marchers and followers had increased to several hundred. They chanted "Tibet Independence" slogans and threw stones at the police officers at the Barkhor Street police station.

	Around 3 PM, the rioters became even more brazen. About 600 people continued to march along Beijing East Road, smashing, looting, burning, and destroying the doors and windows of government agencies and shops along the way. They looted and smashed more than 20 shops, restaurants, and hotels, and set fire to some goods and equipment. More seriously, they gathered several hundred people to attack the Chengguan District Committee and government offices four times, removing and destroying the district government's sign, and smashing traffic police booths and traffic lights. They also destroyed more than 20 vehicles belonging to the police, armed police, and fire department.

	Medical personnel rushed to the scene to rescue the injured, but some rioters smashed the windows of the ambulance and injured the driver. The doors and windows of Jiri Primary School were also damaged.

	Since February 13, separatist elements have staged four marches in Lhasa. Relevant authorities have consistently taken a restrained attitude, attempting to persuade and educate, maintain social order, and avoid direct confrontation. Yesterday, in the face of the rioters' stubborn actions and ineffective persuasion, police officers were forced to open fire and take decisive measures to control the situation.

	During the riot, one armed police officer was killed, and more than 40 police and armed police were injured, with 11 seriously injured and hospitalized. In the chaos, more than 60 rioters and onlookers were injured, and 10 died.

　　拉萨发生严重骚乱事件
    少数分裂主义分子肆意打砸抢烧并开枪
    公安干警被迫采取果断措施以控制事态
    本报拉萨３月６日电  新华社、中央人民广播电台和本报驻拉萨记者联合报道：昨天，少数分裂主义分子在拉萨蓄意制造了一起严重骚乱事件。他们对一些机关单位和商店进行了打、砸、抢、烧，并公然向公安武警开枪射击。
    昨天中午１２时，１３名喇嘛、尼姑打着“西藏独立”的旗帜，沿八廓街游行。行至第二圈时，游行及尾随者增至数百人。他们边走边呼喊“西藏独立”的口号，向八廓街派出所公安人员砸石头。
    下午３时左右，骚乱分子更加猖狂。６００多人在北京东路继续游行，并沿途进行打、砸、抢、烧，打坏了沿街一些机关单位的门窗玻璃，并抢、砸了２０多家商店、饭馆和旅店，放火烧了一些商品和用具。更为严重的是，他们纠集了数百人，４次冲、砸城关区委和区政府机关，摘下了城关区机关的牌子砸毁，并砸毁了交通警岗和指示灯，还砸坏了公安、武警、消防２０多辆车子。
    医务人员赶往现场抢救伤员，一些骚乱分子竟然砸碎救护车的玻璃，打伤了司机。吉日小学的门窗也遭到破坏。
    ２月１３日以来，分裂主义分子曾在拉萨制造了４次游行，有关方面一直采取了克制的态度，进行劝阻和教育，维护了社会治安，避免了正面冲突。昨天，在骚乱分子一意孤行、劝阻无效的情况下，公安干警被迫开枪，并采取果断措施，控制事态发展。
    骚乱中，一名武警战士牺牲，４０多名公安武警受伤，其中，１１名重伤住院。在混乱中，６０多个骚乱分子和围观群众受伤，１０人死亡。
