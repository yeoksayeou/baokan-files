A scholar, due to personal circumstances and poor performance, feels disheartened. Looking around, there are injustices everywhere, leading to resentment, suppression, and psychological imbalance, which in turn causes discomfort. One day, she walked into the "Psychological and Behavioral Health Guidance Center," hoping that the doctor could "restore" her. Upon discussion, she realized that she had no real illness.

That day, the reporter heard Dr. Chu Chengping say that in the past few months, many people who had been "optimized" out of their jobs came to seek help. This consultation center is truly a lifeline for the "modern city."

There was a young man who had just graduated from university and was assigned to teach at a certain academy. After a few days, he was "optimized" out. With nowhere to turn, he thought of the psychologist. Naturally, psychological and behavioral counseling can only alleviate worries, not solve difficulties, but the young man managed to get through it.

At this point, Dr. Chu interjected: Some people's psychological and behavioral issues are largely due to their superiors' inappropriate work methods or their own psychological abnormalities. However, this place treats the condition, not the person, aiming to guide the individual to scientifically understand themselves and their environment. For example, analyzing motivation is a core issue in individual characteristics research. Psychology discusses motivation not in terms of good or bad, but only in terms of strength—reflecting a person's state of being motivated.

Psychological and behavioral health counseling is "old but gold" overseas. The "Center" I interviewed is guided by domestic psychology experts and opened on April 19 last year. It is often bustling with activity. Perhaps because it is located at the Xidan intersection, passersby do not need to make an appointment; they can just walk in, and in about ten minutes, they can complete a psychological status assessment. Waiting for the doctor to see them is also convenient.

In less than a year since its opening, over four to five thousand people have come here for assessments and consultations. According to statistics, one-third are intellectuals and cadres, with the rest being mostly students and workers. In terms of cultural background, those with junior and senior high school education account for 49.5%, and those with college and vocational education account for 44.4%. Perhaps intellectuals are more willing to accept new things, or perhaps intellectuals have more "issues."

Different psychological characteristics have different manifestations. Dr. Chu gave some examples. Many people, especially intellectuals, are sensitive to real-world problems, worry about the country and the people, and often find themselves in conflict between ideals and reality. There are also countless entanglements such as salary adjustments, housing allocation, job titles, and going abroad, which make people tense, suppressed, and fatigued. At best, it affects health and work; at worst, it causes accidents and harms society.

Many people suffer from anxiety disorders. Surprisingly, there are quite a few university students among them. In interpersonal interactions, they find it difficult, becoming anxious when meeting strangers, while society demands that they be good at promoting themselves—navigating the crowd with ease. Many find it hard to adapt, leading to psychological abnormalities.

The situation among adolescents is different. After entering puberty, their bodies and minds undergo significant changes, but their personalities are not yet mature, their emotions are unstable, and their willpower is not strong. They often face conflicts between closure and interaction, dependence and independence, and desires and reality, making them most susceptible to psychological harm—more severe than physical harm.

There are also unexpected situations. The transparency of news is increasing, which is a good thing. However, many people's psychological tolerance is still at the level of the 1950s and 1960s, and they cannot accept the various social scandals being exposed, leading to sudden worries and excessive anxiety. In fact, the past did not have fewer wrongdoings; it's just that they were not transparent and unknown.

They also provided a situation: Experts found that 85% of cardiovascular diseases are related to people's behavior, which psychology calls A-type behavior. This is precisely the result of the tense and noisy urban life. With the progress of urban reform, social life is rapidly changing, old "maladjustments" are overcome, and new "maladjustments" will emerge. Even Dr. Chu and Dr. Zhang feel a sense of urgency. More psychological and behavioral health guidance institutions will emerge in response.

From this, it is worth considering that ideological and political workers might also learn some knowledge in psychology.

### 闹市里的宁静村落——到北京心理行为健康指导中心就诊的“文化人”

　　闹市里的宁静村落
    ——到北京心理行为健康指导中心就诊的“文化人”
    本报记者  卢小飞
    一个知识分子，因为自己的际遇与政绩不佳，有了受挫感。睁眼看周围，处处是不平事，于是愤懑、压抑、心理失重，进而导致不快。一天，她走进了“心理行为健康指导中心”，试图让大夫“复原”自己。一谈方知道，自己并没有什么病。
    那天，记者听储呈平大夫说，这几个月，有不少被“优化”下来的人前来诉述苦衷。这个咨询处对“现代都市”实在是“雪中送炭”。
    有这么个小伙子，大学刚毕业，分到某学院教书。没几天，赶上“优化组合”，给“优化”下来了。走投无路，想起了心理医生。自然，心理行为咨询，只能排忧，不能解难，但小伙子毕竟挺过来了。
    说到这，储大夫特别插了一句：有的人心理行为出了毛病，很大程度是因为他的行政长官工作方法不当或者本身就有心理变态。只是这里看病不看人，意在指导对方科学地认识自己与环境。比如，分析动机是个体特点研究中的核心问题，而心理学谈动机不侧重好坏问题，而只论强与弱——即反映一个人被激励的状态。
    心理行为健康咨询在国外是“老来俏”。我采访的这个“中心”受国内心理学专家指导，去年４月１９日开业，常常门庭若市。也许是位于西单路口，路过此地不用挂号，推门而入，十几分钟可做一份心理状况测查，等医生问诊也不费事。
    开业不到一年，已有四五千人来这里测查、就诊。据统计，有１／３是知识分子和干部，剩下的大都是学生和工人。从文化背景看，具有初、高中文化的占４９．５％，具有大中专文化的占４４．４％。这或许是文化人更易接受新事物，也或许是文化人的“毛病”更多些。
    不同的心理特征有不同的反映。储大夫举了一些例子。很多人，特别是知识分子对现实问题敏感，忧国忧民，而理想与现实又常常发生冲突，还有诸如调工资、分房子、定职称、出国等等数不清的纠葛，使人紧张、压抑、疲劳，轻者影响健康、影响工作，重者造成事故，给社会带来危害。
    很多人患恐惧症。真出乎意料，其中竟有不少大学生。在人际交往方面他们感到吃力，见到生人就紧张，而现实社会又要求他们善于推销自己——在人海中游刃有余，很多人难以适应，由此产生心理变态。
    青少年情况又有不同。进入青春期后，身心发生巨大变化，而个性尚未成熟，情感还不稳定，意志还不坚强，常会有闭锁与交往的冲突、依赖与独立的冲突、愿望与现实的冲突，也最易受到心灵的伤害——比躯体的损害更严重。
    还有想不到的。新闻的透明度越来越高，这本是好事。可很多人因为心理承受能力还是五六十年代的水平，接受不了一桩桩被公之于众的社会丑闻，随之忧患陡生，过度焦虑。其实，并非以往不正之风少，只是过去不“透明”，不知道罢了。
    他们还提供了一个情况：专家们在调查流行病发病规律时，发现８５％的心血管病与人们的行为有关，心理学称之为Ａ型行为，这正是紧张、嘈杂的都市生活造成的。随着城市改革的进程，社会生活迅疾发生变奏，老的“不适症”克服了，新的“不适症”又将产生，连储大夫、张大夫他们也有一种应接不暇的紧迫感。更多的心理行为健康指导机构将会应运而生。
    由此想到，思想政治工作者们不妨也兼学一点心理学方面的知识。
