In recent months, several major cities have experienced the phenomenon of rural migrants being stranded. Suddenly, rural labor has become a "burden" and "blind flow," as if all the problems currently facing cities are caused by rural migrants. Is this conclusion fair?

With the deepening of urban and rural reforms, there is a trend of production factors combining according to the mechanisms of a commodity economy, and regional labor markets are gradually developing. The flow of rural labor not only provides a large amount of labor for urban construction and the development of coastal export-oriented economies but also pioneers the introduction of market competition mechanisms in the reform of China's labor employment system. This is a fact that everyone can see.

A large number of rural laborers moving around inevitably means that some of them will do so blindly. However, from an overall perspective, there is a certain regularity to this, and it is not entirely blind. Therefore, it is not appropriate to label all migrant workers as "blind flow." Currently, the flow of rural labor is different from the chaotic times of war and turmoil, as well as the ten years of turmoil. Their movements are social and economic behaviors induced by the commodity economy mechanism. Just looking at the timing, the migration of Chinese farmers in recent years has a certain regularity: Jiangsu's construction teams move to Northeast and Northwest China in April each year and return to Jiangsu in October; domestic helpers from Anhui, Sichuan, and Hubei return home before the Spring Festival and return to Beijing after the festival... As long as we understand the regularity of these movements, guide them appropriately, and take active measures, there will not be major problems.

The concentrated influx of rural labor into a few major cities and some developed regions indeed puts considerable pressure on local social order and living conditions. It is necessary for various places to take some emergency measures. However, some regions are currently adopting the method of issuing cleanup targets layer by layer, forcing all rural laborers who have found jobs to be cleared out, creating a "cleanup wind," which is not advisable.

It should be said that after thousands of years of living on the land, farmers are gradually leaving their relatively small fields and villages to venture into the rapidly changing outside world. This is a historical progress. Their movements, although they put pressure on transportation, urban infrastructure, and food supply, also promote economic development through their labor, including their hometowns and the places where they seek employment. Therefore, the flow of rural labor and the problems it brings should be evaluated and understood in a realistic and objective manner, and a completely negative attitude should not be taken.

Solving the employment problem of rural labor in China will be a long-term process, but in the short term, it is not as if there is nothing to do. At the very least, the following can be done: first, coordinate arrangements to help farmers find employment opportunities in both urban and rural areas; second, establish a macro-monitoring system for urban and rural labor to provide a basis for scientific decision-making; third, take active measures to create conditions for farmers' mobile employment in urban construction, transportation, etc., and provide necessary consultation services and guidance for mobility; fourth, open up new employment channels, including developing productive activities in rural areas and actively and organizedly exporting a certain amount of labor abroad.

In summary, it is time to use new ideas to understand and new methods to solve the employment problem of surplus rural labor in China.

　　为民工鸣个不平
    郭永利
    近一两个月来，一些大城市相继出现进城农民滞留现象。一时间农村劳动力成了“包袱”、“盲流”，似乎现在城市出现的许多问题都是由农民进城而引起的。这个结论是公正的吗？
    随着城乡改革的深入，出现了生产要素按照商品经济机制组合的趋势，区域性劳务市场逐步发育成长。农村劳动力的流动，不仅为城市建设和沿海外向型经济发展提供了大量劳务，而且在我国劳动用工制度的改革方面率先引入了市场竞争机制。这是有目共睹的事实。
    大量农村劳动力流动，难免有一部分带有一定盲目性。但从总体看是有一定规律性的，并不盲目，因而不能把外出农民笼统地称为“盲流”。现在农村劳动力流动既不同于兵荒马乱年代，也不同于十年动乱时期，他们的流动是在商品经济机制诱导下的社会经济行为。单从时间上看，近几年我国农民的流动就有一定规律可循：江苏的建筑队伍每年４月流往东北、西北，１０月份返回江苏；安徽、四川、湖北等地的保姆，每年春节前回乡，春节后流回北京……只要摸清其中流动规律，因势利导，采取积极措施，就不会出现大的问题。
    农村劳动力较集中地涌入少数大城市和一些发达地区，确实给当地的社会秩序和生活带来了较大的压力。对此，各地采取一些应急措施是必要的。但是，目前有些地区采取层层下达清理指标的办法，将已经找到工作的农村劳动力全数清退，刮起“清理风”，这恐怕就不足取了。
    应该说，几千年栖息于土地的农民，逐渐走出相对狭小的田地，离开村社，奔向瞬息万变的外部世界，这是一种历史性的进步。他们的流动，虽然给交通运输、城市基础设施以及食物供给造成了压力，但也以他们的劳动促进了经济的发展，包括他们本乡和他们谋业的异乡。因此，对农村劳动力的流动及其带来的问题要予以实事求是的评价和理解，不能采取完全否定的态度。
    解决我国农村劳动力就业问题将是一个长期的过程，但近期也并不是就无所作为，起码可以抓紧做这样几件事：一、统筹安排，帮助农民在城乡两个方位寻求就业的机会；二、建立城乡劳动力宏观监测系统，为科学决策提供依据；三、采取积极措施，从城市建设、交通等方面为农民的流动就业创造条件，提供必要的咨询服务和流动指导；四、开辟新的就业门路，包括在农村发展开发性生产，积极地有组织地向国外输出一定量劳务。
    总之，现在是到了用新的观念认识，用新的方法解决我国农村剩余劳动力就业问题的时候了。
