Title: Railway Diversion Cannot Violate Objective Laws

There is a popular saying, "Railways can't handle it, roads aren't full, and waterways can't reach it," which vividly describes the situation in certain regions and at certain times. But can we use the method of equalizing work to "level out" the differences? As a temporary measure, appropriate diversion can alleviate the short-term capacity issues of certain sections or railways, but if we forcibly divert traffic against objective laws without considering economic benefits, it will backfire. In May 1985, railways adjusted prices for freight within 200 kilometers and passenger transport within 160 kilometers. By 1987, the proportion of freight within 200 kilometers had only decreased by 4%, while the proportion of freight between 200 and 300 kilometers had increased by 1%. The proportion of passenger transport within 160 kilometers did not decrease but actually increased by 1%. It can be predicted that even if railway freight rates are adjusted to a reasonable level, the proportion of passenger and freight traffic will not change significantly.

In recent years, there have been many suggestions for diversion, such as building the Biyanguan Port to divert coal from the Shanhaiguan Pass, expanding coastal ports to divert coal from the north to the south, and dredging the southern section of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal to divert traffic from the Xuzhou-Bengbu section of the Beijing-Shanghai line, etc. The investments are enormous, and the effects are well-known. Who will bear the responsibility for the mistakes made? There are countless such examples.

Facts have shown that diversion is either "a drop in the bucket," completely unable to solve the problem, or it backfires. Taking the approach of "treating the head when the foot hurts" is like going south when intending to go north. Tasks that should be handled by railways are forcibly assigned to roads or waterways. Is this feasible? It is worth studying.

Finally, I would like to make a suggestion: I hope the People's Daily can organize people with different viewpoints to discuss in your column the major decision-making issues on how to overcome the difficulties facing the transportation industry. If everyone can adhere to the spirit of seeking truth from facts and act from the perspective of national interests, without any sectarianism, and exchange views in good faith, we will eventually reach a consensus to provide decision-making references. But once a decision is made, it should be firmly implemented. Academic debates can continue to be conducted openly, but if someone individually writes to the top leadership to influence decisions, if there are merits, they should be rewarded; if there are mistakes, it is not just a matter of "taking personal responsibility."

### 对铁路分流不能违反客观规律

专栏：

　　对铁路分流不能违反客观规律
    秦作睿（北方交通大学教授）现在流行着一句顺口溜，“铁路吃不消，公路吃不饱，水运吃不到”，这虽然形象化地描述了某些地区、某些时间内的现象，但可不可以用吃大锅饭的办法来个“填平补齐”呢？适当分流作为权宜之计，解决个别地段、个别铁路能力的不足，或许可解燃眉之急，但如违反客观规律，不问经济效益，人为地强行分流，则适得其反。１９８５年５月铁路对２００公里内的货运和１６０公里以内的客运实行调价。至１９８７年，２００公里以内的货运比重仅下降４％，而２００—３００公里的货运比重却增加了１％。１６０公里以内的客运比重不仅未降下来，反而增加了１％。可以预言，即使把铁路运价能调到应该调到的合理水平，客、货运量的比重也不会有明显的变化。
    最近几年，有关分流的建议很多，如修建鲅鱼圈港分流出关煤炭，扩建沿海港口分流北煤南运，整治京杭运河南段分流京沪线徐州—蚌埠段等等，投资巨大、效果如何，尽人皆知，造成的失误，谁来承担责任？这样的例子不胜枚举。
    事实证明，分流或者是“杯水车薪”，根本不能解决问题，或者是适得其反。采取“头痛医脚”的办法，只能是南辕北辙，应该铁路承担的任务，硬要强加给公路或水运承担，行不行，很值得研究。
    最后，提一点建议，希望人民日报组织有不同观点的人士在贵报专栏上，就如何克服交通运输业所面临的困境的重大决策问题，展开讨论，如果大家都能本着实事求是的精神，从国家利益的角度出发，不抱任何门户之见，善意地交换意见，最后总能得出一致的看法，供领导决策。但一经敲定，就坚决贯彻执行。学术上继续公开争鸣下去是可以的，但如单枪匹马上书最高领导，影响决策，有功应当受奖；有过则不只是“文责自负”的问题了。
