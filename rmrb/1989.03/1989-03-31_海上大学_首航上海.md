The "Sea University" Cosmos ship, founded by the late renowned shipping magnate Mr. Tang Hao Yun, set sail for Shanghai on March 28. Tang Hao Yun's son, the chairman of the board of directors of the Golden Mountain Shipping International Co., Ltd., and the head of the Tang Foundation, Tang Jian Hua, announced at the maiden voyage ceremony that following the participation of six students from Shanghai Jiaotong University in the "Sea University" in 1986, the Tang Foundation will resume the scholarships that were previously canceled this autumn to help Chinese and Asia-Pacific university students participate in sea-based learning.

This non-profit "Sea University," jointly operated with the University of Pittsburgh in the United States, was established by Tang Hao Yun in 1972 with the purchase of a 10,000-ton passenger ship. The university operates in two semesters per year, spring and autumn, each enrolling about 400 college students from various countries to circumnavigate the globe for over 100 days.

　　“海上大学”首航上海
    本报上海３月３０日电  记者萧关根报道：由已故著名航运实业家董浩云先生创办的“海上大学”宇宙号轮，２８日首航上海。董浩云之子、金山轮船国际有限公司董事基金会负责人董建华在首航仪式上宣布，继１９８６年上海交通大学６名学生参加“海上大学”学习后，董氏基金会今年秋季将恢复一度取消的奖学金，以帮助中国及亚太地区大学生参加海上学习。
    这所与美国匹兹堡大学合办的非赢利性的“海上大学”，是董浩云于１９７２年购置的一艘万吨级客轮。一年分春秋两个学期，每期招收４００名左右各国在校大学生，环航世界一周，历时１００多天。
