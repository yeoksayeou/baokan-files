Today marks the tenth anniversary of China's Arbor Day. On this meaningful day, reflecting on the development of forestry and examining the current state of forestry construction, I am filled with both joy and concern.

The achievements of China's forestry industry are indeed commendable. Since the founding of the People's Republic, especially in the past 10 years, significant progress has been made in forestry production and construction. Starting in the 1950s, China began developing and constructing forestry areas in the Northeast, Inner Mongolia, and other regions, establishing 131 forestry bureaus that have provided the country with tens of billions of cubic meters of timber. To protect and cultivate forest resources, over 4,000 state-owned forest farms, more than 170,000 collective forest farms, and over 400 nature reserves have been established nationwide. Particularly noteworthy is the breakthrough progress in afforestation and greening in previously barren plains, with 223 counties meeting the standards for plain greening. The "Great Green Wall" of the "Three-North" Shelterbelt System, the first phase of which has been completed with 100 million mu of afforestation, is currently undergoing the second phase. Building such a massive ecological project under extremely harsh conditions and achieving some success is truly inspiring.

However, amidst the joy, there is also concern, or rather, the concern outweighs the joy. Forestry has accumulated many problems over the years, and there are still many challenges. The current situation facing forestry can be summarized in 12 characters: forest resource crisis, forestry economic distress.

The forest resource crisis is the core of forestry problems, mainly manifested in reduced area, decreased stock, and increased deficit. Compared to advanced forestry countries, China's per capita forest land area and forest coverage rate are significantly lower; even compared to the world average, there is a substantial gap. The social demand for timber has far exceeded the resource's carrying capacity. In the past 10 years, the area of mature forests in 131 forestry bureaus has been halved, with 25 bureaus' exploitable resources nearly depleted. At the current rate of consumption, China's mature forests will be almost exhausted by the end of the century, with extremely serious consequences.

Due to long-term over-exploitation and insufficient investment in afforestation and forest management, forest resources have not received reasonable economic compensation. Coupled with insufficient funding for afforestation, forestry enterprises and collective forest areas face economic distress. Some enterprises can only barely sustain themselves through excessive logging, further exacerbating the forest resource crisis.

Forests are the mainstay of terrestrial ecosystems. They not only provide us with timber and various forest products but also have multiple functions such as water conservation, soil and water conservation, windbreak, sand fixation, soil improvement, climate regulation, and air purification. Forestry is both an industry and a public welfare undertaking. Due to the reduction of forest resources, some places have experienced ecological degradation, increased soil erosion, and frequent water, drought, and sandstorm disasters, already causing significant difficulties for agricultural production, water conservancy projects, and people's lives.

Forestry problems are not limited to forestry itself but are related to the overall development of the national economy and society. Because the prosperity of forestry directly affects national land security, agricultural production, the Four Modernizations, and the long-term interests of future generations, we must recognize the difficulties and strive to overcome them. How to get out of the predicament and gradually revitalize forestry? The fundamental way out is to deepen forestry reform. Through deepening reform, implementing intensive management, developing forestry productivity, increasing forest resources, enhancing forestry vitality, and gradually achieving a virtuous cycle of stable forest resource growth and stable forestry economic development.

To this end, the Ministry of Forestry has proposed four transformations and one overall goal, as well as the construction of five major shelterbelt systems since last year.

The four transformations are: first, from primarily exploiting natural forests to basing on afforestation, emphasizing the construction of artificial timber forest bases and shelterbelt systems; second, from primarily single timber production to diversified operations and comprehensive utilization; third, from primarily extensive management to intensive management and scientific management; fourth, from primarily forestry departments to the whole nation engaging in forestry, including the state, collectives, individuals, and various industries. In other words, from traditional, closed forestry to modern social forestry that emphasizes economic, ecological, and social benefits.

One overall goal is: by the end of this century, under the premise of ensuring timely renewal of logging sites, increase the forest area by 450 million mu and nurture 450 million mu of young and middle-aged forests. We need to accelerate the construction of 100 million mu of fast-growing, high-yield timber forest bases and the construction of five major shelterbelt projects: the "Three-North" Shelterbelt, coastal shelterbelt, upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River shelterbelt, Taihang Mountain greening, and plain farmland shelterbelt system.

Achieving the forestry development plan goals and increasing forest resources is a complex system project. It is not only the task of the forestry department but also a matter for the whole society. Therefore, first, it requires the high attention of leaders at all levels, and second, it requires the joint efforts of all citizens. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of Arbor Day, the Ministry of Forestry and People's Daily jointly hold the "Ten Years of Trees" essay contest, aiming to introduce the advanced individuals and regions that have emerged in greening efforts and mobilize the masses to more consciously participate in the greening cause. It can be believed that through long-term, unremitting, and arduous efforts, we will definitely make our motherland more green and radiant.

### 谈谈林业的喜与忧

　　谈谈林业的喜与忧
    林业部部长  高德占
    今天，是我国植树节十周年。在这个很有意义的日子里，回顾林业发展的历程，看看林业建设的现状，不由喜忧之感同涌心头。
    我国林业取得的成就，确实令人欣喜。建国以来，特别是近１０年来，林业生产建设取得了很大成绩。５０年代开始，我国在东北、内蒙古等林区进行了开发建设，已建成１３１个林业局，为国家提供了几十亿立方米的木材。为保护和培育森林资源，全国建立了４０００多个国营林场、１７万多个集体林场和４００多处自然保护区。特别是，过去无林少林的平原地区，造林绿化有突破性进展，已有２２３个县达到平原绿化标准。被誉为“绿色长城”的“三北”防护林体系建设，第一期工程已经完成，造林达１亿亩，第二期工程正加紧进行。在极其艰苦的条件下，建设浩大的生态工程，并取得一定成效，实在令人振奋。
    然而，喜中有忧，或者说是忧甚于喜。林业多年来积累的问题不少，困难还很多。当前林业面临的形势十分严峻，可以概括为１２个字：森林资源危机，林业经济危困。
    森林资源危机是林业问题的核心，主要表现为面积减少、蓄积下降，赤字增加。与林业先进国家比，我国人均占有林地面积和森林覆盖率，均相差很远；与世界平均水平比，也差一大截。社会木材的需求量已大大超过资源的承受能力。近１０年来，１３１个林业局的成过熟林面积减少了一半，已有２５个局的可采资源基本枯竭。按目前的消耗速度，我国的成过熟林将在本世纪末基本消耗殆尽，后果极为严重。
    由于长期以来取之于林多，用之于林少，森林资源消耗得不到合理的经济补偿，再加上对造林营林的资金投入不足，森工企业和集体林区在经济上面临危困。有的企业只能靠过量采伐勉强维持，这样又加剧了森林资源的危机。
    森林是陆地生态系统的主体，它不仅为我们提供木材和各种林副产品，更具有涵养水源、保持水土、防风固沙、改良土壤、调节气候、净化空气等多种功能。林业既是一项产业，又是一项公益事业。由于森林资源的减少，致使一些地方生态恶化，水土流失加剧，水旱风沙灾害频繁，已经给农牧业生产、水利建设和人民生活造成很大困难。
    林业的问题，不仅局限于林业本身，而且关系国民经济和社会发展的全局。因为林业的兴衰，直接关系国土保安、农业生产、四化大业和子孙后代的长远利益。我们必须认识困难，努力克服困难。如何摆脱困境，使林业逐步走向振兴？根本的出路在于深化林业改革。通过深化改革，实行集约经营，发展林业生产力，增加森林资源，增强林业活力，逐步实现森林资源稳步增长和林业经济稳定发展的良性循环。
    为此，林业部从去年开始，就提出了四个转变、一个总体目标和建设五大防护林体系。
    四个转变是：一、由采伐利用天然林为主转向以营林为基础、重视人工营造用材林基地和建设防护林体系；二、由单一木材生产为主转向多种经营、综合利用；三、由粗放经营为主转向集约经营、科学管理；四、由林业部门为主转向国家、集体、个人、各行各业全民办林业。就是说，由传统的、封闭的林业转向注重经济、生态、社会三个效益的、现代的社会林业。
    一个总体目标是：到本世纪末，在保证采伐迹地及时更新的前提下，增加森林面积４．５亿亩，抚育中幼林４．５亿亩。要抓紧营造１亿亩速生丰产用材林基地，抓紧建设五大防护林工程：“三北”防护林、沿海防护林、长江中上游防护林、太行山绿化和平原农田防护林体系。
    实现林业发展规划目标，增加森林资源，是一个复杂的系统工程，不仅是林业部门的任务，而且是全社会的事业。因此，一是需要各级领导的高度重视，二是需要全体国民的共同努力。在迎接植树节十周年日子里，林业部和人民日报联合举办“十年树木”征文，目的就是通过介绍在绿化中涌现出来的先进人物、先进地区的事迹，动员广大群众更加自觉地投身于绿化事业。可以相信，通过长期不懈的艰苦努力，一定能使哺育我们的神州大地多披绿装、多增光彩。
