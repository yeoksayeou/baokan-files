Zhou Yi invented the "Zhou Yi."

Zhou Yi's mother said, "A girl should have dignified manners and a gentle appearance, so let's name her Zhou Yi." The guide at the 15th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva, however, had a more imaginative interpretation: "Arc, meaning the circumference, and an arc length gauge can also be called Zhou Yi. Zhou Yi invented the 'Zhou Yi.'"

Zhou Yi is an engineer at the South China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research. Her invention, the arc length gauge, resembles a triangle ruler and can immediately read the length of any arc, as well as divide a circumference into any number of parts. It won the silver medal at the 15th International Invention Exhibition in Geneva. A foreign news agency exclaimed, "The descendants of Zu Chongzhi are once again leading in the field of curve measurement!"

Zhou Yi is the same age as New China. After being tempered by labor in the production and construction corps, she entered a synthetic fiber factory in Huaiyin and became the production leader of the factory's testing laboratory. Once, during a quality improvement project, she found that the most fiber breaks occurred between the inverted gourd-shaped drawing rollers. To determine the length of the fiber wrapped around the drawing rollers, complex calculations were required. She couldn't help but think, "If there were a tool like a ruler or protractor to measure arc lengths, that would be great!" From that day on, she became fascinated with arcs.

Outside of her 8-hour workday, Zhou Yi immersed herself in studying arcs of all sizes. The door to the testing laboratory was locked from the inside, but she was completely oblivious. During the Spring Festival, while others went home, the testing laboratory became her domain. Her desk and bedside were filled with papers covered in drawings of various arcs and calculations. She repeatedly arranged arcs of equal length according to various mathematical laws. With her rigorous thinking and rich spatial imagination, she believed she had found the mathematical trajectory to measure the length of any arc. She consulted with a mathematics department at a university in Nanjing, and the evaluation was: "Ingenious design, mathematical derivation is completely valid." Zhou Yi's heart warmed. "But," the professor added, "the mathematical trajectory you found is a curve that humans cannot draw precisely, a transcendental function."

Zhou Yi felt her knowledge was insufficient, so she temporarily set aside her beloved arcs and picked up her high school textbooks. In 1978, she was admitted to Hehai University. In the "sea of knowledge," she eagerly absorbed wisdom, studying not only the required advanced mathematics but also numerical approximation and spline functions. After a few years, Zhou Yi felt she had gained enough confidence to tackle the arc length gauge again. Finally, a new curve that could replace the transcendental function within the allowable precision range was born.

In 1983, Zhou Yi took the stage at the Chinese Society of Engineering and presented her paper, "A Direct Reading Measuring Instrument." Her paper was rated as an excellent paper, and she was admitted as a member of the society. In 1985, the Chinese Patent Office granted her a non-employment invention patent for the arc length gauge. The principle of the arc length gauge was included in the textbooks of several universities. But Zhou Yi's goal was to make the crystal-clear arc length gauge available to everyone as soon as possible. Fortunately, Shanghai Precision Instrument Factory came knocking, and the price of the arc length gauge was set not to exceed the standard for similar cultural products.

The problem of measuring arcs was solved, but more challenges awaited Zhou Yi. A sixth-grader wrote to her, "Auntie Zhou, if the arc length gauge is engraved on a telescope, couldn't we measure the circumference of the moon and the orbit of artificial satellites? If it's engraved on a microscope, couldn't we measure the length of bacteria and cells?"

Currently, Zhou Yi is fascinated with measuring non-circular curves and has applied for a national natural science fund.

　　周仪发明“周仪”
    本报记者  龚永泉
    她妈妈说：“女孩子就该举止端庄，仪表娴静，就叫周仪吧！”而日内瓦第十五届国际发明展览会的解说员小姐则联想丰富：“圆弧，即圆周，弧长仪也可称周仪，周仪发明了‘周仪’”。
    周仪是水电部南京水文水资源研究所工程师。她发明的弧长仪酷似三角板，可以立即读出任意圆弧的长度，也能任意地分割圆周，获日内瓦第十五届国际发明展览会银质奖。一家外国通讯社惊叹：“祖冲之的后代又在曲线度量的领域里领先了一步！”
    周仪与新中国同龄。经过生产建设兵团的劳动锻炼，进入淮阴一家合成纤维厂，当上了工厂试验室的生产班长。一次，进行产品质量攻关，她发现呈倒挂葫芦状的牵伸盘之间的纤维断头最多，而要知道绕在牵伸盘上纤维的长度，却要进行繁杂的运算。她不禁心头一亮：“要是像直尺、量角器那样，有一种度量弧长的玩意儿多好啊！”从这一天起，她就同圆弧结下了不解之缘。
    ８小时之外，周仪忘情地潜心钻研大大小小的圆弧，试验室大门被人反锁上了，她全然不知。春节，别人回家了，试验室就成了她的一统天下，案头、床头放满了画着各种圆弧和计算的图纸。她一次又一次地把长度相等的圆弧按照多种数学规律排列。凭着严密的思维和丰富的空间想象力，她认为找到了能度量任意圆弧长度的数学轨迹。她去南京一所大学数学系请教，评价是：“巧妙的构思，数学推导完全成立”。周仪心头一热。“但是，你找到的数学轨迹是一条人工无法精确绘制的超越函数的曲线。”一个“但是”把周仪从三伏天拉到了三九天。　　
    周仪感到了自己知识的不足，她暂时放下了梦牵魂绕的圆弧，拣起了高中时的课本，１９７８年考入了河海大学。在知识的“河海”里，她如饥似渴地吮吸着智慧的乳汁，除了必修的高等数学，又自修了数值逼近、样条函数。几年下来，周仪感到自己“底气”足了，再一次向弧长仪发起了冲击。终于，一条在精度允许范围内可替代超越函数的新曲线诞生了。
    １９８３年，周仪走上了中国工程学会的讲坛，宣读了《一次读数量数器》的论文。她的文章被评为优秀论文，本人被吸收为学会会员。１９８５年，中国专利局授予了弧长仪的非职务发明专利，弧长仪的原理被编入了几所大学的教材。但周仪想的是，尽快让人们能用上晶莹剔透的弧长仪。正巧，上海精工仪器厂找上门来了，弧长仪的售价被定在不高于同类文化用品的标准。
    度量圆弧的难题攻克了，但更多的难题在向周仪扑来。一个六年级小学生来信：“周阿姨，如果把弧长仪刻在望远镜上，不就可以量出月球的周长、人造卫星的轨道吗？如果刻在显微镜上，不就可以量出细菌、细胞的长度了吗？”
    目前，周仪又迷上了非圆曲线的度量，已申请到国家自然科学基金。
