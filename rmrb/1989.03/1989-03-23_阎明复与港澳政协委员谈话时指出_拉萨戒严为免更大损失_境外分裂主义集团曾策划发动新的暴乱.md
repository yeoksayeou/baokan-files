Yan Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the United Front Work Department, said today that the State Council decided to implement martial law in Lhasa starting March 8 to avoid bloodshed and to prevent greater losses to people's lives and property. This is because there is conclusive evidence that separatist groups abroad planned to launch new violent disturbances on March 10.

Yan Mingfu said that based on the reliable intelligence obtained at that time, the rioters had smuggled some weapons into Tibet from abroad, and some had received terrorist training in foreign countries before infiltrating Tibet. The imposition of martial law disrupted their plans for new disturbances in Lhasa.

Yan Mingfu disclosed these details today during a conversation with NPC members from Hong Kong and Macao.

He said that there are many people abroad who wish to separate Tibet from China, including some old imperialists and new opportunists. He gave an example, saying that a European woman played a disgraceful role in the Lhasa disturbances on December 10 last year. She was sent by the separatist groups abroad and brought instructions to organize the disturbances. She had used different aliases to enter Tibet multiple times. Yan Mingfu said that her disgraceful identity was exposed by patriotic people in Tibet. This shows that the vast majority of monks in Tibet are patriotic.

Yan Mingfu emphasized, "We are determined to defend the territorial integrity of the country. We are determined to work with the people of Tibet to improve Tibet's economy, politics, and people's lives. At the same time, we sincerely hope that the Dalai Lama will abandon his activities to split the motherland and sit down to negotiate with the central government."

Yan Mingfu also revealed that relevant departments of the central government are now maintaining direct contact with the Dalai Lama.

　　阎明复与港澳政协委员谈话时指出        
    拉萨戒严为免更大损失
    境外分裂主义集团曾策划发动新的暴乱
    新华社北京３月２１日电  （记者李海堂）中共中央书记处书记、中央统战部部长阎明复今天说，国务院决定３月８日开始在拉萨实施戒严的目的是为了避免流血和给人民生命财产带来更大损失，因为有关方面已得到确凿证据，境外的分裂主义集团策划在３月１０日发动新的暴力骚乱。
    阎明复说，当时根据得到的确切情报，骚乱分子已经从境外将一些武器运进西藏，并有一些人在外国接受了恐怖训练，然后潜入西藏。实施戒严就打乱了他们在拉萨新的骚乱计划。
    阎明复是今天同港澳地区全国政协委员谈话时披露这些情况的。
    他说，现在国外希望把西藏分裂出去的大有人在，包括一些老牌的帝国主义者和新的野心家。他举例说，有一个欧洲的女士在去年１２月１０日的拉萨骚乱事件中扮演了不光彩的角色，她就是境外分裂主义集团派来的，她带来了组织骚乱的指令。她曾用不同化名多次到西藏来。阎明复说，关于她的不光彩身份，是西藏的爱国人士揭露的。这说明，西藏绝大多数喇嘛还是爱国的。
    阎明复强调，“我们有决心捍卫国家的领土完整，我们有决心和西藏人民一道把西藏的经济、政治和人民的生活搞得越来越好。同时，我们也真诚希望达赖喇嘛放弃分裂祖国的活动，坐下来和中央政府谈判。”
    阎明复还透露说，中央有关部门现在同达赖保持着直接的联系。
