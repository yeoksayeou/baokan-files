Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 6th. (Reporter Guo Diancheng) The head of the PLA's Greenification Committee and Director of the General Logistics Department, Zhao Nanqi, revealed today that the PLA's greenification efforts have yielded significant economic and ecological benefits. Annually, an average of 40,000 to 50,000 cubic meters of mature timber is harvested from the campuses, and nearly 40 million pounds of fruit were harvested last year. Fifty percent of the PLA's campuses have achieved a garden-like status.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 6th. (Reporter Guo Diancheng) The General Staff Department, General Political Department, and General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army recently issued a "Decision on Strengthening Military Greenification Work." The decision calls for all military personnel to actively participate in tree planting, take on the responsibility of greenification, and become pioneers in this effort, working alongside the people of the nation to accelerate the process of national land greenification.

The decision states that the overall goal of the PLA's greenification work is to plant forests on all suitable barren hills and lands around military bases. Campuses should achieve a status of being flower-filled and garden-like. By the year 2000, the PLA aims to produce 150 million kilograms of dried and fresh fruits annually, 100,000 cubic meters of timber, and support local tree planting efforts with more than 10 million saplings each year.

The decision emphasizes the importance of incorporating greenification education into military training. It calls for widespread promotion of the legal, public, and social benefits of voluntary tree planting, ensuring that every soldier, worker, and family member understands their responsibilities and obligations.
