Over the past few months, "computer fortune-telling" has suddenly become prevalent in Hangzhou, appearing in train stations, docks, and busy street corners. It is understood that there are at least a dozen such stalls in the small city of Hangzhou.

Anyone with a basic understanding of computers knows that so-called "computer fortune-telling" involves pre-programmed fortune-telling phrases stored in a computer, much like how medicines are stored in a pharmacy. When someone comes to have their fortune told, the computer mechanically retrieves the corresponding phrases based on the person's birth year, month, day, and gender, and presents them as the person's "destiny." People born on the same year, month, and day, and of the same gender, will have the same "destiny"! Obviously, this is nothing more than a "computer game."

Some hospitals in Hangzhou are also keen on this type of "computer fortune-telling" to make money. A colleague of mine went to a certain hospital for a pre-marital check-up, and one of the items required was to pay 4 yuan to calculate the biological rhythms of both parties; otherwise, the hospital would not stamp the health check-up as qualified. I have conducted research on human biological rhythms and programmed computer software for this purpose (which is now used in our unit). When I examined and verified the biological rhythm table obtained by my colleague for 4 yuan, I found that the rhythm table printed by the hospital was full of errors.

The proliferation of "computer fortune-telling" on the streets of Hangzhou is indeed a tragedy for science. I appeal to the relevant departments: for the sake of the people's physical and mental health, and to prevent modern superstition from spreading, it is time to take action on this matter!

### “电脑算命”误事又骗钱

　　“电脑算命”误事又骗钱
    近几个月来，在杭州的车站、码头、闹市街口，“电脑算命”突然多了起来。据了解，在小小的杭州城区不下十数摊。
    稍懂得电脑知识的人都知道，所谓“电脑算命”就是把人为编好的算命语句像中药柜那样事先分别一一存放在各自的“柜子”里。谁要算命，即根据出生年月日、性别的不同组合按不同的编码机械地到电脑的各个“柜子”里自动取出所谓性格、命运的句子，便成了你的“命”。同年同月同日生、性别又相同的人，“命运”一定相同！显然，这充其量不过是“电脑游戏”而已。
    杭州的某些医院为了赚钱也十分热衷于这类“电脑算命”。笔者有一位同事因结婚去某医院体检，其中有一个项目：必须付４元钱计算双方的生物节律，否则医院不予盖上体检合格章。笔者曾根据有关资料从事过人体生物节律的研究及电脑程序的编制（现已应用于本单位），把同事那张花了４元钱得来的人体生物节律表拿来查看及验算，竟发现该医院打印出的节律表谬误百出。
    杭州街头“电脑算命”泛滥成灾，实在是科学的悲哀。笔者呼吁，为了人民的身心健康，为了不让现代迷信泛滥，有关部门应该管一管这件事了！
