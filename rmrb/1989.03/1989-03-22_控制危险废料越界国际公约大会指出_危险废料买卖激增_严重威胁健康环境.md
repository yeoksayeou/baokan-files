Xinhua News Agency, Basel, March 20th.

Environment ministers, senior government officials, and environmental experts from over 100 countries gathered in Basel, the Swiss chemical industry hub, today to finalize and sign an international convention aimed at controlling the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes.

In his opening remarks, Mustafa Tolba, the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), emphasized that the trade in hazardous waste has become a significant global issue, posing threats to human health and the environment. Official statistics indicate that member countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) produce over 300 million tons of hazardous waste annually. The Greenpeace organization, attending the conference as an observer, reported that between 1986 and 1988, industrialized nations exported 600 million tons of hazardous waste to Eastern European countries and developing nations. Tolba urged the delegates to reach a consensus during the three-day conference and adopt the draft convention on controlling the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes.

The draft convention, prepared under the coordination and guidance of the UNEP, aims to establish a global reporting system. It stipulates that exporting countries must notify importing countries in advance about the quantity and nature of the hazardous waste being exported.

A UNEP official stated that there is a strong likelihood that the convention on controlling the transboundary movement of hazardous wastes will be adopted.

    新华社巴塞尔３月２０日电  来自１００多个国家的环境保护部长、政府高级官员和环保专家今天聚首瑞士化工名城巴塞尔，最后审议和签订控制危险废料越界活动的国际公约。
    联合国环境规划署执行主任莫斯塔法·托尔巴在会议开幕词中指出，危险废料买卖已成为当今世界威胁人们身体健康和生活环境的重要问题。据官方统计，经合组织成员国每年生产危险废料３亿多吨。以观察员身份出席本次会议的绿色和平组织在最近发表的公报说，自１９８６年至１９８８年间，工业化国家向东欧国家和第三世界国家输出了６００万吨危险废料。他呼吁与会代表在为期３天的会议期间，努力取得一致意见，通过关于控制危险废料越界活动的国际公约草案。
    在联合国环境规划署的组织和协调下起草的关于控制危险废料越界活动的国际公约草案旨在在全世界建立一种报告制度，规定危险废料出口国必须事先通报进口国出口废料的数量和性质。
    联合国环境规划署官员说，关于控制危险废料越界活动的国际公约获得通过的希望很大。
