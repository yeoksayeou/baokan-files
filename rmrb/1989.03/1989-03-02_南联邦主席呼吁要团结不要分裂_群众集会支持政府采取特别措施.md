Yugoslav Federal President Dizdarevic on the 28th afternoon, in a rally with nearly a million people in Belgrade, emphasized that "we cannot split, and we do not allow anyone to split us." "Only by uniting together can we survive."

Dizdarevic pointed out, "We cannot take the path of arguing among different nationalities, we must restore unity and friendship."

Dizdarevic said that no one can be allowed to destroy the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He said that the duty of the Federal Presidency is to defend the integrity of Yugoslavia, the constitutional system, and to take all legal measures to maintain public order and the safety of every citizen of the state.

Thousands of students in Belgrade began gathering in front of the Federal Parliament building from 1:00 AM on the 27th. On the 28th morning, workers and citizens from the capital also came to participate in the rally. By noon, the number of participants had reached hundreds of thousands. They expressed support for the Federal Presidency's special measures taken in Kosovo, demanding the prompt completion of the constitutional amendments in the Republic of Serbia, emphasizing that people like Morina should not resign under the pressure of Albanian nationalist forces, and demanding the publication of the names of the organizers of the Albanian demonstrations in November and the February strike, and holding them politically and criminally responsible. They also accused certain leaders in Slovenia and Croatia of supporting Albanian nationalism and separatist forces.

It is reported that similar rallies are being held or will be held today in various places in the Republic of Serbia, Kosovo, and the two autonomous provinces of Vojvodina.
