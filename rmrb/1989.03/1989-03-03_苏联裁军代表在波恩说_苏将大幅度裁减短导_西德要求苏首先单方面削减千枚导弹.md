Soviet Disarmament Representative in Bonn Says the Soviet Union Will Significantly Reduce Short-Range Missiles; West Germany Demands the Soviet Union First Unilaterally Reduce 1,000 Missiles

	People's Daily, Bonn, March 1 — Correspondent Jiang Jian Guo reports: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and disarmament negotiator Karpov said yesterday in Bonn to the press that the Soviet Union is prepared to reduce its 1,600 short-range nuclear missiles to the current Western level of 88, and is also willing to negotiate with NATO to completely eliminate this type of nuclear weapon.

	Karpov said yesterday after meeting with West German Chancellor's foreign affairs advisor Teltschik and others that the Soviet Union advocates immediately negotiating with the United States and NATO European countries on short-range nuclear weapons. The conventional weapons negotiations starting in Vienna on March 6 should be conducted simultaneously with the short-range nuclear weapons negotiations to establish a "strategic balance" in Europe.

	New China News Agency, Bonn, March 1 — West German ruling party coalition parliamentary group chairman Dreger today issued a statement in Bonn, welcoming the Soviet Union's willingness to reduce or even completely eliminate short-range missiles, while demanding that the Soviet Union "first unilaterally reduce 1,000 (short-range) systems."

	Dreger made this statement in response to the disarmament intentions expressed by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and disarmament representative Karpov to the press in Bonn yesterday.

	Dreger said that in the short-range missile field, the Soviet Union has a 15:1 advantage over NATO, "which cannot continue to exist."

	Dreger emphasized that the Soviet Union should "first unilaterally reduce 1,000 short-range missiles." He said, even if this is done, the Soviet Union will still have a 365:88 advantage over NATO.

	According to NATO statistics, the Warsaw Pact possesses 1,365 short-range nuclear missiles.

    苏联裁军代表在波恩说
    苏将大幅度裁减短导
    西德要求苏首先单方面削减千枚导弹
    本报波恩3月1日电　记者江建国报道：苏联副外长、裁军谈判代表卡尔波夫昨天在波恩对新闻界说，苏联准备把它的1600枚短程核导弹裁减到目前西方88枚的水平，也愿意同北约谈判完全消除这类核武器。
    卡尔波夫昨天在同西德总理府外交顾问特尔契克等会谈后说，苏联主张立即同美国和北约的欧洲国家就短程核武器谈判。3月6日在维也纳开始的常规武器谈判应该与短程核武器谈判同时进行，以便在欧洲建立“战略平衡”。
    新华社波恩3月1日电西德主要执政党联盟党议会党团主席德雷格尔今天在波恩发表声明，对苏联准备削减甚至完全消除短程导弹表示欢迎，同时要求苏联“首先单方面削减1000枚（短导）系统。”
    德雷格尔是就苏联外交部副部长、裁军代表卡尔波夫昨天在波恩对新闻界表示的裁军意愿发表这一声明的。
    德雷格尔说，在短导方面，苏联拥有对北约15∶1的优势，“这是不能继续存在的”。
    德雷格尔强调苏联应“首先单方面削减1000枚短导”。他说，即使如此，苏联对北约仍拥有365∶88枚的优势。
    根据北约统计，华约拥有的短程核导弹为1365枚。
