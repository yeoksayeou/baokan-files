Xie Tian Discusses "That Five"

Cundinggu

The television series "That Five," co-produced by the Beijing Film Studio and the Tianjin Television Station, received high praise after its trial screening. The author visited the series' director, Xie Tian, to discuss the creative process and artistic aspirations behind the production.

Xie Tian said, "That Five" portrays the character and fate of a declining Manchu aristocrat, which at first glance seems like an old and somewhat niche topic, unlikely to attract contemporary audiences. However, upon closer examination, the protagonist's character and experiences have a strong sense of reality, and today's audience will not find it unfamiliar. It appears old but is actually new, which provides a basis for this niche topic to communicate with contemporary audiences.

(It seems the audience was indeed attracted. How did you achieve this?)

In simple terms, we approached the production of the television series as if we were making a film. From script revisions to casting, on-location shooting to post-production, we used the working methods and standards of filmmaking, striving for rigor and meticulousness. The results seem to be effective. This is inseparable from the strong support of CCTV and relevant parties, as well as the full trust of the writer Deng Youmei in our production team. Our collaboration was very pleasant.

(The strong cast of this play left a deep impression. This shows the strictness and appropriateness of the casting. Regarding the choice of the protagonist "That Five" being played by the crosstalk performer Feng Gong, what was your initial idea?)

When I first read the script, the character of "That Five" in my mind was very close to Feng Gong. Feng Gong has the conditions in appearance and temperament to play this role, but crosstalk performance and film acting are quite different, to cross over in one go is indeed very difficult. This is also why many people doubted and worried about him taking on the role of "That Five." But he has talent and works very hard, and in the end, he did not disappoint everyone. Even the film actress Ni Ping, who acted opposite him, was surprised.

(The success of the actors also includes the success of the director. This play has a lot of comedic elements, but the entire play is not purely a comedy. How do you view the issue of unifying the style and form of the entire play, and how did you handle it?)

I think we should first look at this issue from the perspective of the characters. "That Five" has a very distinct comedic character, but his fate is full of tragedy. You could say he is a unique tragicomic character. This determines that the plot unfolding around him cannot be purely comedic or purely tragic, but must be a mix of tragedy and comedy, both sad and funny. Therefore, we can only use the character's personality and fate as the thread to truly unify the entire play, and not pursue style for the sake of style, or form for the sake of form. That way, the form might be unified, but the content would be fragmented.

("That Five" also has a lot of new ideas in terms of style and form. The entire play seems lively and engaging, down-to-earth and vivid, yet it also makes one feel that the tone is high, embodying a kind of simple yet serious aesthetic pursuit. I think the audience would definitely like to hear your thoughts.)

Comedy has always been one of my great interests, and making it accessible to both the elite and the masses is a goal I have always pursued. But I believe that comedy should indeed make the audience laugh, but this laughter is only a means and effect of comedy, not the goal. This means should be used naturally, making the audience laugh comfortably and with something to think about. If you rely on vulgar gimmicks or even lowbrow humor to force the audience to laugh for the sake of cheap comedic effects, then it is not only not comedy, but first and foremost, it is not art.

　　谢添谈《那五》
    寸丁谷
    北京电影制片厂和天津电视台联合摄制的电视连续剧《那五》试映后甚获好评，笔者为此走访了该剧总导演谢添，请他谈谈该剧的创作经过和艺术追求。
    谢添说，《那五》表现的虽是一个没落八旗子弟的性格和命运，乍看似乎题材很旧，也很“偏”，不易引起当代观众的兴趣。但细一分析，主人公的性格和经历却有相当强烈的现实感，今天的观众看来并不会觉得陌生。似旧实新，这就使这个“偏题”有了与当代观众沟通的基础。
    （观众确被吸引了。您是怎样拍的呢？）
    简单地说，就是要像拍电影那样来拍电视剧。从剧本修改到选择演员，实地拍摄到后期制作，我们都采用了拍电影时的工作方式和标准，力求严格、细致。看来确有成效。这与中央电视台和有关各方的大力支持，作家邓友梅对我们剧组人员的充分信赖是分不开的。我们这次合作很愉快。
    （这部戏演员阵容的齐整给人印象很深，由此可知演员选择的严格和恰当。关于主人公那五选定相声演员冯巩饰演，您当初的设想如何？）
    我在初读剧本的时候，脑子里的那五就跟冯巩很接近。冯巩在形象、气质上有担任这个角色的条件，只是相声表演与电影表演距离很大，要一次跨过，又的确很难。这也正是不少人对他出任“那五”表示怀疑、担忧的原因。但他有灵气，也很用功，后来果真不负众望，连跟他演对手戏的电影演员倪萍都觉得意外。
    （演员的成功里就包括着导演的成功。这部戏里有大量的喜剧情节，但全剧又不单纯是喜剧。请问你如何看待全剧风格和样式的统一问题，又是怎样处理的？）
    我看首先要从人物出发来看这个问题。那五的性格有很鲜明的喜剧色彩，但他的命运又是充满悲剧性的，可以说这是一个很独特的悲喜剧人物。这就决定了围绕他展开的情节不可能是一喜到底，或者一悲到底，而必定是悲喜交融，亦喜亦悲。所以只能以人物性格和命运为线索才能真正统一全剧，不能为样式而样式，为风格而风格。那样也许形式上统一了，内容却割裂了。
    （《那五》在风格样式上也很有新意。整个戏看来情趣盎然，通俗生动，又使人感到格调很高，体现了一种朴实而严肃的美学追求。我想观众一定愿意听听您的想法。）
    喜剧向来是我的一大爱好，雅俗共赏更是我一直追求的目标。但我认为喜剧固然应该让观众笑，这笑却只是喜剧的手段和效果，而不是目的。这种手段应该用得自然，让观众笑得舒服，并且有所回味。如果为制造廉价的喜剧效果，靠庸俗噱头甚至低级趣味强求观众的笑，那就不光不是喜剧，首先就不是艺术了。
