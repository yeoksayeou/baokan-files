The scene before us is shocking. It is necessary to shout at these sand diggers and path destroyers: "Stop!" We must also ask the local officials, both big and small: "Must we wait until there are overturned vehicles and casualties before taking action to stop this?"

    毁路者，住手！
    眼前景象，令人心惊。有必要向这些掏沙毁路者喝一声：“住手！”还得问问当地大小干部：“难道非要等到车覆人亡之后才去制止不成？”
