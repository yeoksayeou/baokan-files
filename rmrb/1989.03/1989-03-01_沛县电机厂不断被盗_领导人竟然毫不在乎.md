Column: Investigation and Reflection

In the latter half of last year, a theft occurred at the Electric Motor Factory in Peixian County. The public security authorities investigated and apprehended 15 thieves. Notably, 12 of these criminals were employees of the factory. Over a period of more than a year, the factory experienced 38 thefts. Why is the factory plagued by so many thefts? This is directly related to the lax and weak leadership of the factory's management team and the chaotic management.

Although the factory has established various rules and regulations, they have not been implemented effectively. As a result, the employees' morale is low, discipline is lax, and incidents of fighting, brawling, and theft of public property occur frequently. Last year, 27 employees of the factory committed crimes, accounting for 18% of the total workforce.

For many years, the factory has had no dedicated security personnel. The two gatekeepers are a retired employee and an elderly person. Criminals have entered and exited the factory 27 times during the day, and the gatekeepers have never questioned them. In March 1988, thief Chen stole the key to the semi-finished product warehouse and committed 13 thefts over eight months, stealing generator parts worth over 13,000 yuan. The warehouse keeper did not notice until the case was revealed. Even after the public security personnel came to verify the situation, the factory leaders were unaware of the theft. Due to the lack of records for items entering and exiting the warehouse, the factory still cannot determine how many items were stolen.

A newly purchased set of molds worth 2,700 yuan vanished overnight. As a result, the factory stopped production for more than a month, causing indirect economic losses of tens of thousands of yuan. Despite reports to the factory leaders, no action was taken. The theft of spot welding machine parts worth 13,000 yuan rendered the entire machine useless. The factory leaders neither reported the incident nor conducted an investigation.

During our investigation at the factory, the leaders told us, "I think you are looking for trouble. What can the newspaper or radio do to me?" Despite multiple thefts at the factory, he remained indifferent. We believe that necessary economic, administrative, or legal sanctions should be imposed on the dereliction of duty by leaders of enterprises with chaotic management and severe theft problems!

　　沛县电机厂不断被盗  领导人竟然毫不在乎
    去年下半年，我县电机厂发生一起盗窃案。经公安部门侦破，１５名盗窃分子先后落网。值得注意的是，这１５名不法分子中，竟有１２名是这个厂的职工。这个厂在一年多的时间内共发生３８起盗窃案。为什么这个厂盗窃案不断呢？这与厂的领导班子懒散软弱，管理混乱有直接关系。
    这个厂虽然制定了各种规章制度，但是没有落到实处，以致于职工思想涣散，纪律松懈，打架斗殴、盗窃公物的事件屡有发生。去年，这个厂有２７名职工违法犯罪，占全厂职工的１８％。
    多年来，厂里没有专职保卫人员。两个门卫，一个是退休留用人员，一个年老体弱。犯罪分子曾２７次在中午盗窃厂里的物资，大摇大摆地出入厂门，门卫从未盘问过。１９８８年３月，盗窃分子陈某自己配制了半成品仓库的钥匙，在长达８个月的时间内作案１３次，盗窃价值达１．３万多元的发电机配件，而仓库保管员一直没有发觉。直到案发后，公安人员找到厂里核对情况时，厂领导人才知道仓库被盗。由于入库和出库的物品没有登记，至今厂里仍无法确定有多少物品被盗了。
    厂里花２７００元购进的一套新模具，一夜之间不翼而飞。为此，这个厂停产一个多月，间接经济损失数万元。有关人员向厂领导人汇报，但无人管。价值１．３万元的碰焊机零件被盗，致使整台机器报废。厂领导人既不报案，也不追查。
    我们在这个厂调查时，厂领导人对我们说：“我看你们是没事找事，报纸、电台能把我怎样？”厂里发生多起盗窃案，他竟然毫不在乎。我们认为，应对那些管理混乱、失盗严重的企业领导人的渎职行为，给予必要的经济、行政或法律的制裁！江苏沛县　王旭　鲍玉伦
