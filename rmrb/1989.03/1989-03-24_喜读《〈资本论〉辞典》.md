	The new year has begun, and I have received the "Dictionary of Capital" edited by Comrade Song Tao. This is the first dictionary of "Capital" published in our country, and it is worth celebrating for both the economic and publishing communities.

	This dictionary contains 1,632 entries, covering categories, concepts, schools of thought, theories, names, works, and other explanations related to "Capital" and its manuscripts. It also includes a brief introduction to the manuscripts of "Capital," Engels and "Capital," editions of "Capital," and a timeline of "Capital," providing systematic historical documentation.

	The compilation of this dictionary involved 266 scholars with extensive research experience. Many of them are experts who have dedicated their lives to the study of "Capital" and are renowned both domestically and internationally. They have worked tirelessly for six years to produce this significant work, which is no easy task.

	"Capital" is a scientific masterpiece of Marxism that illuminates the world. It is rare to find a work in the social sciences that possesses such vibrant and enduring vitality and exerts such a profound theoretical influence on the course of human history. Shortly after the publication of "Capital," Engels wrote in a review for the "Democratic Weekly": "Since there have been capitalists and workers on this earth, no book has been as important to the workers as the one before us." (Marx and Engels Collected Works, Volume 16, Page 263) Over a hundred years of history have proven that Engels' comments were far-sighted. Soon after "Capital" was published, the bourgeoisie sensed its power and attempted to suppress it with "silence," but they failed. Later, they launched attacks and defamations, with some rulers even banning it, but to no avail. On the contrary, it shone like a flint, the more it was struck, the brighter it gleamed. Today, some bourgeois economists who respect facts have already acknowledged the theoretical value of this scientific work. In the 1960s, the Austrian magazine "Future" wrote: "This work, despite being published a long time ago, has not been forgotten or buried. Instead, it is famous worldwide today and is more vibrant than ever. This is extremely rare for scientific literature." This evaluation is entirely accurate.

	The Chinese people, under the guidance of Marxism, embarked on the path to liberation. After the October Revolution in Russia, Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, was the first to write in our country to promote the basic ideas of "Capital." In the early 1930s, multiple translations of the first volume of "Capital" began to be published. In 1938, the Shanghai Reading Life Publishing House, under extremely adverse political and economic conditions, published the first, second, and third volumes of "Capital" translated by Guo Dalu and Wang Yanan. Guo and Wang prepared for ten years and worked tirelessly for three years to complete this monumental project, their efforts and contributions are truly remarkable. Since then, this masterpiece has been reprinted continuously (some Marxist political economy textbooks are essentially abridged versions of "Capital"), its influence has grown, and it has nurtured generation after generation of Chinese Marxists.

	"Capital" elucidates the laws of motion of the capitalist economy. We are building socialism with Chinese characteristics, so is it still necessary to study it? I believe it is very necessary.

	Building socialism with Chinese characteristics requires a commitment to developing a planned commodity economy, and "Capital" is precisely the most profound and comprehensive scientific work that discusses the laws of motion of the commodity economy.

	Originally, political economy as a science is based on the study of the commodity economy and its development laws. The outstanding representatives of bourgeois classical economics, Adam Smith and David Ricardo, achieved their highest accomplishments by establishing the labor theory of value. However, their arguments for this theory were not thorough. Marx inherited their excellent achievements and critically demonstrated the dual nature of labor contained in commodities; he explored the value form or exchange value, unraveled the mystery of money, and thus placed the labor theory of value on an unshakable foundation. Marx's economic theory system is permeated by the labor theory of value. Without the labor theory of value, it is impossible to discover the law of surplus value.

	"Capital" studies the capitalist commodity economy. Can the economic laws it elucidates be applied to the socialist commodity economy? This requires specific analysis. The commodity economy has common laws, such as the law of value, which applies not only to the capitalist commodity economy but also to the socialist commodity economy. Different types of commodity economies also have their unique laws. For example, the law of surplus value is a law of the capitalist commodity economy and does not apply to the socialist commodity economy. However, if we abstract away the capitalist mode of production, Marx's analysis of surplus value (i.e., surplus product) and its transformation forms such as profit, interest, and rent, can also be applied to the socialist commodity economy. In 1921, Lenin commented on a passage in Bukharin's "The Economy of the Transition Period" as follows: "No success. Profit also satisfies the needs of 'society.' One should say: under these conditions, the surplus product does not go to the private owning class, but to all workers, and only to them." (Lenin: "Comments on Bukharin's 'The Economy of the Transition Period,'" People's Publishing House, Pages 41-42) Here, Lenin tells us that as long as we distinguish the mode of production, some of the categories elucidated in "Capital" can still be used under socialist conditions.

	Yes, Marx clearly stated that under the conditions of socialist public ownership, there will be no commodities and money. However, as a dialectical materialist, he did not absolutize this proposition, and in his works, he left several paths for later generations to explore further. Two years before Marx's death, he wrote an article titled "Critique of A. Wagner's 'Textbook of Political Economy.'" In this article, Marx declared that when he studied value, he was concerned with bourgeois relations and did not touch upon the "social state" (actually referring to the socialist society). He assumed that if due to a poor harvest, the price of grain exceeds its value, then the "social state" would exceed to a lesser extent than the grain hoarders (actually referring to the capitalist society), because the "social state" would organize production in advance so that the annual grain supply is only slightly affected by the good or bad harvest. The production, supply, and demand are reasonably adjusted. ("Marx and Engels Collected Works," Volume 19, Page 403) If my understanding is correct, here Marx did not regard planning and the commodity economy as incompatible.

	Why, when introducing the "Dictionary of Capital," do I say so much that seems unrelated to the dictionary? My intention is to advocate for more people to read "Capital," and to read the original work. "Capital" is a vast theoretical treasure trove, and the development of a planned commodity economy still requires continuous drawing of strength from it. Only then will the dictionary have a place to shine.

	Finally, I admire the spirit of the Shandong People's Publishing House in enthusiastically publishing academic works. Since 1983, they have sought out experts, traveled extensively, organized a large number of experts, and worked tirelessly to publish the "Research Series on Capital." They have finally achieved a series of results. The "Dictionary of Capital" is elegantly bound and beautifully printed, reflecting the serious attitude of the publishing house colleagues.

　　喜读《〈资本论〉辞典》
    苏星
    新春伊始，我收到宋涛同志主编的《〈资本论〉辞典》。这是我国编辑出版的第一部《资本论》辞书，值得经济学界和出版界为之庆贺。
    这部辞典，共收辞条１６３２条，包括《资本论》及其手稿所涉及的范畴、概念，学派、学说、人名、著作和其他方面的释文；并附有《资本论》手稿简介、恩格斯与《资本论》、《资本论》版本、《资本论》年表等系统的历史文献资料。
    编写这部辞典的，有２６６位素有研究的学者，其中有许多人是终身致力于《资本论》研究、蜚声中外的专家。他们辛勤耕耘，六易寒暑，结此硕果，诚非易事。
    《资本论》作为马克思主义的科学巨著，光照环宇。现在还很少找到一本社会科学著作，具有如此旺盛而持久的生命力，在改变人类社会历史进程中发挥出如此震天撼地的理论力量。《资本论》出版后不久，恩格斯就在为《民主周报》所写的书评中说：“自地球上有资本家和工人以来，没有一本书像我们面前这本书那样，对于工人具有如此重要的意义。”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第１６卷，第２６３页）一百多年来的历史证明，恩格斯的评论是有远见的。《资本论》刚问世，资产阶级已预感到它的威力，开始企图用“沉默”把它置于死地，但是，失败了。后来，又对其进行围攻和诋毁，有的统治者甚至把它列为禁书，也无济于事。相反地，它却像燧石一样，越受打击，越光灿夺目。如今，某些尊重事实的资产阶级经济学家也已经承认这部科学著作的理论价值了。６０年代，奥地利的《未来》杂志这样写道：“这部著作尽管发表很久了，它不仅没有被遗忘、没有被埋葬，相反，今天，它闻名于全世界，并比任何时候都有生命力。这对于科学书籍是非常罕见的”。这个评价，完全符合实际。
    中国人民是在马克思主义的指引下，走上解放的道路的。俄国十月革命以后，中国共产党的创始人之一李大钊首次在我国撰文宣传《资本论》的基本思想。３０年代初开始，陆续出版了《资本论》第一卷的多种译本。１９３８年，上海读书生活出版社在政治条件十分恶劣、经济条件十分困难的情况下，出版了郭大力、王亚南翻译的《资本论》第一、二、三卷。郭、王准备十年，伏案三载，完成此宏伟工程，劳苦功高，诚不在禹下。从此，这部巨著不断再版（有些马克思主义的政治经济学教科书，实为《资本论》的缩本），影响日大，哺育了一代又一代中国的马克思主义者。
    《资本论》是阐明资本主义经济运动规律的，我们正在建设有中国特色的社会主义，还有没有必要对它进行钻研呢？我认为，十分必要。
    建设有中国特色的社会主义，必须致力于发展有计划的商品经济，而《资本论》恰恰是最深刻、最全面论述商品经济运动规律的科学著作。
    本来，政治经济学作为一门科学，就是通过研究商品经济及其发展规律奠定自己的基础的。资产阶级古典经济学的杰出代表人物亚当·斯密和大卫·李嘉图的最高成就，是创立了劳动价值论。但是，他们对这一理论的论证是不彻底的。马克思继承了他们的优秀成果，批判地证明了商品中包含的劳动二重性；探讨了价值形式或交换价值，解开了货币之谜，才把劳动价值论置于不可动摇的基础上。马克思的经济理论体系，是以劳动价值论贯彻始终的。离开劳动价值论，也就不可能发现剩余价值规律。
    《资本论》研究的是资本主义商品经济，它所阐明的经济规律，能适用于社会主义商品经济吗？这要具体分析。商品经济有共同规律，比如价值规律，它不仅适用于资本主义商品经济，也适用于社会主义商品经济。不同性质的商品经济又有其特殊规律，比如剩余价值规律，是资本主义商品经济的规律，就不适用于社会主义商品经济。但是，如果抽掉资本主义的生产关系，马克思对剩余价值（即剩余产品）的分析，特别是作为它的转化形式的利润、利息、地租等经济范畴，也可以适用于社会主义商品经济。１９２１年，列宁对布哈林的《过渡时期的经济》一书中所说“在资本实行统治的条件下，生产是剩余价值的生产，是为利润进行的生产。在无产阶级实行统治的条件下，生产是为抵销社会需要进行的生产”一段话，作过如下评论：“没有成功。利润也是满足‘社会’需要的。应该说：在这种条件下，剩余产品不归私有者阶级，而归全体劳动者，而且只归他们”。（列宁：《对布哈林〈过渡时期的经济〉一书的评论》，人民出版社，第４１—４２页）在这里，列宁告诉我们，只要分清生产关系，《资本论》所阐明的一些范畴，在社会主义条件下依然可以使用。
    是的，马克思明确说过，在社会主义公有制条件下，将不存在商品和货币。但是，作为辩证唯物论者，他并没有把这一论断绝对化，在他的著作中还留下了若干供后人进一步探索的思路。在马克思逝世的前两年，他写过一篇题为《评阿·瓦格纳的〈政治经济学教科书〉》的文章。在这篇文章里，马克思声明，他研究价值时，涉及的是资产阶级关系，并没有涉及到“社会国家”（实际是指社会主义社会）。他假定，如果由于歉收，粮食的价格超过价值的话，那么“社会国家”超过的程度肯定会小于粮食囤积商（实际指资本主义社会），因为“‘社会国家’事先就这样来组织生产，使年粮食供应只是在极小的程度上受收成好坏的影响。生产量、供应和需求得到合理的调节。”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第１９卷，第４０３页）如果我的理解不错的话，在这里，马克思并没有把计划和商品经济看作是互不相容的。
    评介《〈资本论〉辞典》，为什么要说这么一大篇似乎与辞典无关的话呢？我的用意是，提倡有更多的人读《资本论》，而且要读原著。《资本论》是一个巨大的理论宝库，发展有计划的商品经济，还需不断从中汲取力量。这样辞典才有用武之地。
    最后，我很钦佩山东人民出版社热心出版学术著作的精神。从１９８３年以来，他们求师访贤，到处奔波，组织大批专家，为出版《〈资本论〉研究丛书》劳心费力，终于取得一批成果。《〈资本论〉辞典》装帧大方，印刷精致，也反映了出版社同志的认真态度。
