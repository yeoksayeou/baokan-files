Before the Curtain Falls
— Observations from the Closing Session of the Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference

The nine-day Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference drew to a close yesterday with a lively atmosphere. At the closing session, following the decision made at the previous day's meeting of the Standing Committee, the conference elected additional vice-chairmen and standing committee members through individual voting.

In order, the vote for Li Kaixin began. The call for "those who abstain, please raise your hands" had barely finished when two arms were raised high in the middle of the back section of the hall. Reporters from both China and abroad rushed over.

The voting results for the two vice-chairman candidates were: Hou Jianru, 1,633 votes in favor, 15 votes against, 39 abstentions; Ding Guangxun, 1,666 votes in favor, 6 votes against, 15 abstentions.

The voting results for the six standing committee members were: Li Kaixin, 1,685 votes in favor, no votes against, 2 abstentions; Li Ganliu, 1,684 votes in favor, 1 vote against, 2 abstentions; He Luli, 1683 votes in favor, 1 vote against, 3 abstentions; Yang Di, 1,677 votes in favor, 4 votes against, 6 abstentions; Qian Zhongshu, 1,681 votes in favor, 1 vote against, 5 abstentions; Jie Feng, 1,660 votes in favor, 10 votes against, 17 abstentions.

Compared to the voting on the political resolution, the climax of the personnel election was just a small interlude. "Comrades, do you have any opinions..." The chairman of the conference had not finished speaking when Guo Luchan, a committee member sitting in the back, stood up. "I have just one suggestion. The fourth line, 'The meeting was filled with a democratic and united atmosphere,' I suggest changing to 'The meeting promoted democracy and had a very united atmosphere.'" Saying this, he handed a revised draft to a staff member: "Please hurry and send this to the presidium!"

"Chairman, I am Hong Kong delegate Liu Naiqiang." This energetic delegate expressed his views on the government work report and the other three documents, suggesting that "agree" be changed to "seriously consider."

After repeatedly seeking opinions, the political resolution of the Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was passed with 1 vote against and 1 abstention. The hall erupted in enthusiastic applause.

The fourth agenda item, the report on the review of proposals, pushed the lively atmosphere of the meeting to a new high.

"I suggest adding two sentences on the fourth page, second line: Strengthen the study of educational science and implement scientific education." A committee member in the back row spoke loudly.

"Suggest adding more fertilizer, artificial fertilizer, and other high-quality fertilizers." Old Red Army veteran Mei Shengwei urged. He added a brief explanation: "Now, whether it's grain or vegetables, they are all very rough. Because there is too much chemical fertilizer in the fields, the soil is hardened. This problem is worth paying attention to!"

"We should strive to create an environment for teaching and educating people, and suggest adding 'internal and external' before 'environment'." Wang Fuzhong, a committee member from the education sector in Tianjin, said from his seat in row 4, seat 32.

"Suggest adding the words 'overseas Chinese affairs'." Another committee member suggested from somewhere.

Before the report was put to a vote, Wang Zhou, a committee member from the education group, rushed to speak: "I saw in the report that it mentions 'encouraging leading cadres to ride domestically produced cars.' I have an opinion. Domestic cars are of poor quality, consume more fuel, and are not economical. Can we change it to 'encourage leading cadres to ride more economical domestically produced cars'?" This sparked laughter throughout the hall. It was clear that not everyone agreed with this view.

Vice Chairman Wang Renzhong explained to everyone: "This is a report on the handling of proposals and it is not possible to include every proposal. If there are no objections, I propose that the proposals committee consider everyone's opinions and make some revisions."

"Chairman, I have a suggestion." Before the report was put to a vote, Ye Wenling, a committee member sitting in the front row, took advantage of her position to make the final speech: "Overall, this report is satisfactory, but I hope that we do not see it only after we enter the conference hall. If possible, next time, distribute it a day earlier so that committee members can more calmly propose revisions." This suggestion earned enthusiastic applause from the entire hall.

The applause expressed everyone's expectations for the work of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and also expressed their hopes for accelerating the democratization process in our country.

　　帷幕落下之前        
    ——全国政协七届二次会议闭幕会见闻
    本报记者  张何平  凌志军  何伟
    为期９天的全国政协七届二次会议降下帷幕之前，气氛颇为热烈。昨天的闭幕会上，根据前天召开的政协常委会议的决定，以逐一表决方式增选副主席和常委。
    按顺序，对李开信委员首先表决。“弃权的请举手”话音刚落，会场中间后区高高举起两只手臂。中外记者呼拉拉围了过去。
    表决结果，两名副主席候选人得票数是：侯镜如，１６３３票赞成，１５票反对，３９票弃权；丁光训，１６６６票赞成，６票反对，１５票弃权。
    ６名常委的表决结果是：李开信，１６８５票赞成，没有反对票，２票弃权；李赣骝，１６８４票赞成，１票反对，２票弃权；何鲁丽，１６８３票赞成，１票反对，３票弃权；杨堤，１６７７票赞成，４票反对，６票弃权；钱钟书，１６８１票赞成，１票反对，５票弃权；解峰，１６６０票赞成，１０票反对，１７票弃权。
    与政治决议表决相比，人事选举的高潮还只是个小插曲。“各位委员，有什么意见……”大会主席还未把话说完，坐在后区的郭履灿委员就站了起来“我只提一句话意见。第４行‘会议充满民主和团结的气氛’，我建议改为‘会议发扬了民主，具有甚为团结的气氛’。”说着，他往工作人员手里一塞：“这是我的修改稿，请赶快送到主席团！”
    “主席，我是香港委员刘乃强。”这位年富力强的委员在发言中陈述对政府工作报告等三个文件的看法，建议把“赞同”改为“认真考虑”。
    在反复询问意见之后，政协七届二次会议的政治决议以１人反对，１人弃权通过。会场响起热烈的掌声。
    第四项议程关于提案审查情况报告的表决，把会场的热烈气氛推向新的高潮。
    “我建议在第４页第２行加上两句话：加强教育科学的研究，实行科学育人。”后排一委员大声发言。
    “建议写上增加农肥、人造肥料和其它更优质的肥料。”老红军梅盛伟疾呼。他略加说明：“现在粮食也好，蔬菜也好，都很粗糙。因为地里化肥太多，土地板结。这个问题值得重视！”
    “要努力造就教书育人的环境，在‘环境’前面建议加上‘内部和外部’。”坐在４排３２号座位上的天津教育界的王福重委员说。
    “建议加上‘侨务’二字”。不知什么地方又有委员提议。
    在报告付诸表决之前，教育组的王洲委员抢着发言：“我看到报告中谈到‘提倡领导干部乘坐国产汽车’。我有意见。国产汽车质量差，用油多，不经济。是否可以改为‘提倡领导干部乘坐较经济的国产汽车’？”引起全场一片笑声。听得出来，并非都同意这个观点。
    王任重副主席向大家解释说：“这是提案处理提告，不可能把每一项提案都写进去。如果没有什么意见，我提议议案委员会考虑大家的意见，作些修改。”
    “主席，我有一个建议”报告表决之前，坐在前排的叶文玲委员凭借地利优势，抢着作了压轴发言：“这个报告总的来说是令人满意的，但我希望，不要在我们走进大会会场以后才看到。如果下一次会议有可能的话，提前一天发，这样委员们提修改意见可以更从容些。”这个建议，博得全场热烈的掌声。
    掌声表达了大家对政协工作的期待，也表达了对加快我国民主化进程的希望。
