The Hongxing Fireworks Factory in Hongxing Village, Qingfeng Township, Jianhu County, Jiangsu Province, has chaotic management, lax labor discipline, and no attendance tracking for workers going to and from work. New employees are not given safety education or technical training upon entering the factory.

Last year on January 24, a worker's violation of operating procedures caused a firecracker to explode, destroying one of the factory's rooms. However, the factory's leadership did not learn from this incident. This year on January 26 in the afternoon, the worker in charge of distributing powder, Lu Ruoyou, arrived late for work and hurriedly began distributing the powder. The worker in charge of receiving the powder was in a fluster, causing 114 kilograms of finished and semi-finished fireworks to explode. The factory was reduced to rubble, resulting in the death of 13 people, 11 seriously injured, and 15 lightly injured. Even houses 500 meters away were shaken down.

　　红星花炮厂管理混乱
    江苏建湖县庆丰乡红星村红星花炮厂管理混乱，劳动纪律松弛，工人上下班无考勤，新工人进厂，也不进行安全教育和技术培训。
    去年１月２４日，一工人因违章操作，引爆鞭炮，炸毁厂房一间。但厂领导人并没有从中吸取教训，今年１月２６日下午，发药工陆如友上班迟到，急急忙忙发药，领药工手忙脚乱，引爆了１１４公斤的花炮成品和半成品，厂房毁为平地，当场死亡１３人，重伤１１人，轻伤１５人，５００米外的民房也被震塌了好几间。
