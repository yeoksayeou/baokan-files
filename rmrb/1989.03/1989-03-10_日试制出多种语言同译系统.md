Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 7th.

Japan's NTT Information and Communication Systems Corporation has successfully developed a translation system capable of simultaneously translating one language into multiple languages.

According to the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun*, this new translation system differs from conventional translation machines as it does not require a translation dictionary between two languages. Instead, it employs an "intermediate language" for translation. Consequently, the number of vocabulary entries in the computer is reduced, making it easier to translate between multiple languages.

The new translation system supports mutual translation among six languages, including English, Japanese, and Chinese. Once this system is put into practical use, it will be effectively applied to the translation of product introductions and commercial documents between different countries.

　　日试制出多种语言同译系统
    新华社东京３月７日电  日本电气情报研究所，试制成可将一种语言同时翻译成多种语言的翻译系统。
    据《日本经济新闻》报道，这种新翻译系统与以往的翻译机不同，不需要编入两种语言之间的翻译辞典，而是采用“中间语言”进行翻译的新方式。因此编入计算机的词汇数量减少，易于进行多种语言之间的翻译。
    新翻译系统可在英文、日文、中文等６种语言之间互译。新翻译系统实际应用后，将有效应用于各国之间产品介绍和商业文件的翻译。
