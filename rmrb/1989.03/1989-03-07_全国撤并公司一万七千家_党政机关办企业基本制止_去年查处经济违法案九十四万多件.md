Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 6th. Reporters Bì Yuèhuá and Pān Gǎng report: Deputy Director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, Liú Mǐnxué, revealed today that after several months of rectification, the issue of party and government agencies engaging in business operations has been basically halted. The problem of party and government cadres and retired cadres holding positions in companies has been resolved according to regulations. However, the progress of rectification work in various places is currently very uneven.

The rapid increase in various types of companies has become a significant issue. By the end of 1988, the total number of companies nationwide reached 477,400, of which 114,900 were newly established since the second half of 1986. Liú Mǐnxué said that after a period of rectification, by the end of January this year, a total of 17,000 companies nationwide had been closed or merged, accounting for 5.8% of the total number of companies. There were 24,187 companies operated by party and government agencies, of which 8,667 had been closed or merged, and 10,632 had been financially decoupled from the agencies, accounting for 80% of the total number of companies operated by party and government agencies. There were 32,798 party and government cadres holding positions in companies, of whom 23,536 had resigned from their company positions or resigned from their government jobs to enter companies, accounting for 72% of the total number of party and government cadres holding positions in companies. There were 11,664 retired party and government cadres holding positions in companies, of whom 8,332 had resigned from their company positions or had completed the necessary procedures according to regulations, accounting for 71.4%.

The rectification of companies with mixed government and enterprise functions has been challenging but has achieved some results. According to statistics from 23 provinces, there are 9,577 companies with mixed government and enterprise functions, of which 537 have been closed or suspended, accounting for 5.6%, and 3,975 have achieved government-enterprise separation, accounting for 41.5%.

Additionally, it was learned from the National Conference of Directors of Industry and Commerce that another important aspect of rectification and regulation—handling economic law violations—has achieved some results. According to statistics, the national industry and commerce administration handled 945,600 cases last year, including over 60,000 major cases, an increase of 40% compared to the previous year. Fines and confiscations amounted to 608 million yuan, an increase of 57.67%. Additionally, 1,314 cases involving 1,415 individuals were transferred to judicial authorities for criminal prosecution.

　　全国撤并公司一万七千家
    党政机关办企业基本制止     
    去年查处经济违法案九十四万多件
    本报北京３月６日讯  记者毕月华、潘岗报道：国家工商局副局长刘敏学今天在此间透露，经过数月的清理整顿，各界关注的党政机关经商办企业现象基本上得到了制止，党政干部和退离休干部在公司兼职、任职的问题已按规定基本得到解决。但目前各地清理整顿工作的进展很不平衡。
    迅速增多的各类公司成为一大公害。１９８８年底，全国公司达４７．７４万家，其中１１．４９万家是１９８６年下半年以来新成立的。刘敏学说，经过前一段的清理整顿，到今年１月底，全国已撤并的公司共有１．７万余户，占公司总数的５．８％；党政机关开办的公司共有２４１８７户，已撤并８６６７户，已与机关财务脱钩１０６３２户，占党政机关开办公司总数的８０％；党政机关在职干部在公司兼职的共有３２７９８人，已辞去公司职务或辞去机关公职转入公司的共有２３５３６人，占党政机关干部在公司兼职总数的７２％；党政机关离退休干部在公司任职的共有１１６６４人，已辞去公司职务或已按规定办理相应手续的共有８３３２人，占７１．４％。
    政企不分公司的清理整顿难度比较大，但也取得了一定效果。据２３个省的统计，政企不分公司共有９５７７户，已撤销或停办的有５３７户，占５．６％，已实行政企分开的３９７５户，占４１．５％。
    又讯　记者从全国工商局长会议上同时获悉：治理、整顿的一项重要内容——查处经济违法案件取得一定成果。据统计，仅全国工商管理机关去年查处的就有９４．５６万件，其中大要案达６万余件，比上年增加４０％；罚没款为６．０８亿元，比上年增加５７．６７％。另外，还有１３１４起案件，１４１５人被移交司法机关追究刑事责任。
