The State Council's Decision on Key Points of Current Industrial Policy
(March 15, 1989)

Formulating a correct industrial policy, clearly defining the focus areas for support and restriction in various sectors of the national economy, is an important basis for adjusting the industrial structure and conducting macroeconomic control. The formulation and implementation of industrial policies help integrate reform and development, planning and market mechanisms, and are crucial for better implementing the overall policy of reform and opening up. They ensure the smooth completion of the current tasks of rectifying the economic environment and economic order, and promote the long-term stable development of China's national economy.

Currently, China's total demand exceeds total supply, and there are serious issues in the industrial structure. Specifically, the processing industry has excessive production capacity, while the basic industries such as agriculture, energy, raw materials, and transportation lack sufficient capacity. There is also an overcapacity in general processing industries, while high-level processing capabilities are insufficient. The regional distribution of industries is not rational, and regional advantages are not fully utilized. Enterprises are fragmented, with low concentration of production, low specialization levels, and poor coordination and collaboration among enterprises. These issues not only hinder the rational use and allocation of resources but also impede economic stability and the improvement of macroeconomic efficiency. It is necessary to start from the current situation, formulate a reasonable industrial policy, and while controlling and reducing total demand, focus on adjusting and transforming the industrial structure. This will prevent economic stagflation, improve the quality and efficiency of the national economy on the basis of optimizing the structure. The basic direction and tasks for formulating industrial policies and adjusting industrial structures in the current and future periods are: to concentrate efforts on developing basic industries such as agriculture, energy, transportation, and raw materials, strengthen industries that can increase effective supply, and enhance the momentum for economic development. At the same time, control the development of general processing industries to ensure their coordination with the development of basic industries.

I. Principles for Formulating Current Industrial Policies

The principles for formulating current industrial policies are as follows:

First, adhere to the policy of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms. Use industrial policies as a guide to strengthen macroeconomic control, guide market development, coordinate various actions, and gradually alleviate the contradictions between total demand and total supply, and between consumption structure and industrial structure.

Second, reduce and control the production and construction of surplus products, and increase and expand the production and construction of short-supply products. Concentrate efforts on first improving the production and construction of grain, cotton, coal, electricity, transportation (especially railway transportation), and market-scarce light textile products.

Third, based on market demand, industrial linkages, technological progress, foreign exchange earnings, and economic benefits, arrange the sequence of industrial development and formulate relevant policies. Clearly define what to support and what to restrict. At the same time, properly handle the relationship between the coordinated development of key industries and general industries, the relationship between the adjustment of existing production factors and the allocation of new factors, and the relationship between the overall industrial layout and the utilization of regional advantages.

Fourth, the key points of the current industrial policy are formulated based on the principle of combining long-term and short-term goals, with a focus on the short term. During the rectification and adjustment process, the industrial policy will be adjusted accordingly based on the economic development situation.

Fifth, the authority to formulate industrial policies lies with the State Council. To ensure the implementation of national industrial policies, various departments and the people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities with separate plans should formulate implementation measures based on national industrial policies and in conjunction with the characteristics of their respective departments and regions. These measures should be reported to the State Council for the record. If any supplementary regulations to the national industrial policy are needed, they must be submitted to the State Council for approval. Governments below the provincial level should not formulate implementation measures in layers. The relationship between implementing the economic responsibility system and implementing industrial policies should be properly handled. The entire country is a unified market, and all regions must implement the national industrial policy. They should not disrupt the overall and long-term interests of the country for the sake of local and short-term interests.

Sixth, the implementation of industrial policies should use economic, administrative, legal, and disciplinary means, and strengthen ideological and political work. The departments of planning, finance, banking, taxation, pricing, foreign trade, and industrial and commercial administration must have a unified goal and coordinated actions. All regulatory measures and policies should be compatible and serve the rectification and adjustment policy and the implementation of industrial policies.

II. Industrial Development Sequence

The current industrial development sequence is the basic basis for various departments and regions to implement industrial policies and is also the guiding target for various economic policies.

Since the same industry may have different situations in various sectors of social reproduction, different policies need to be adopted. Therefore, the industrial development sequence should be listed separately according to different sectors of social reproduction. The current development sequence of major industries is as follows:

Further adjust the export commodity structure, gradually increase the proportion of manufactured goods, especially deep-processed products and electromechanical products, based on international market demand. Strive to improve the quality of export commodities and focus on improving the grade and foreign exchange earnings of export commodities. For domestic and export sales, arrange them comprehensively. For commodities that are resource-rich and not absolutely necessary domestically, export as much as possible; for commodities needed in both domestic and international markets, export a portion; for large-scale resource commodities related to national economy and people's livelihood, export strictly according to the plan; for domestically scarce products, restrict or prohibit exports. At the same time, based on China's resource shortages and abundant labor force, actively develop processing with supplied materials, processing with supplied samples, assembly with supplied parts, offset trade, and other businesses using the international market.

On the import side: Ensure the import of important materials related to national economy and people's livelihood; rationally arrange the introduction of advanced technologies, equipment, key components, and the import of domestically scarce important raw materials and market-scarce materials to support production and improve technological levels. At the same time, based on the domestic industrial structure and consumption policies, appropriately arrange the import of products to adjust the domestic supply and demand structure and promote the development of national industries.

III. Guaranteeing Policies and Organizational Implementation (Summary)

(1) Various departments and regions should, based on the requirements of the industrial development sequence, reduce fixed asset investments, adjust the industrial structure, guide the direction of foreign investment, and, in conjunction with financial and material capabilities, arrange annual plans and the "Eighth Five-Year Plan."

(2) Banks should, based on the requirements of the industrial development sequence, formulate corresponding credit policies and classify and prioritize enterprises. They should withdraw funds from restricted industries and invest them in supported industries to promote the healthy circulation of social funds. The State Planning Commission should, in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance and the banks, formulate the priority sequence for fixed asset investment loans based on the requirements of the industrial development sequence. Gradually propose the proportion of investment loans for key industries and establish a corresponding investment loan subsidy fund. Research the proportion of major industry investments in the total social investment and further improve the relevant regulations on differential interest rates for fixed asset investment loans.

(3) The national tax authorities should, during the process of improving the tax system, adjust the existing tax types and rates based on the industrial development sequence. Continue to levy and appropriately adjust the construction tax; use differential tax rates to guide industrial development. When designing new tax system plans, conduct thorough investigations and consider taxation based on the requirements of the industrial development sequence.

The Ministry of Finance should reform the depreciation system for key industries, appropriately increase the depreciation rate, and shorten the depreciation period to promote the transformation and development of key industries.

(4) The pricing department should, based on the requirements of the industrial development sequence, improve the pricing methods for important commodities.

(5) Based on the requirements of the industrial development sequence, the State Planning Commission and the foreign exchange management department should plan and guide the use of foreign exchange held by local and departmental authorities, and the provincial-level local governments should strengthen the management of their own foreign exchange. All regions and relevant departments should formulate local and departmental foreign exchange import plans, which will be balanced and issued by the State Planning Commission. Domestic financial institutions should strengthen the management of foreign exchange loans. Strengthen the unified management of the use of foreign investment. The State Planning Commission should, based on the requirements of the industrial development sequence, formulate a list of foreign investment priorities according to the source of funds and in conjunction with the characteristics of various industries to guide the direction of foreign investment. Strictly restrict investment in surplus industries and certain non-production sectors. For Sino-foreign joint ventures, cooperative enterprises, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises that have been approved before the issuance of this decision, the original contracts will still be executed.

(6) The departments of railways, transportation, energy, and materials should, based on the requirements of the industrial development sequence, allocate transportation and material resources to key supported industries, and prioritize meeting the needs of key industries. Special attention should be paid to the allocation of transportation and electricity, which are important means of controlling the current implementation of the industrial development sequence.

(7) The State Planning Commission and relevant departments should, based on the technical and economic characteristics, supply and demand patterns, and industrial linkages of various industries, formulate policies on enterprise organizational structures and economic scale standards for key products based on the industrial development sequence. They should also formulate plans and adjustment measures to promote economies of scale. Products that are suitable for mass production and have significant economies of scale should be produced and constructed according to the principles of economies of scale and specialized cooperation, avoiding low-level repetition and regional homogenization tendencies. Based on industrial policies, through enterprise reorganization, mergers, and the development of enterprise groups, promote the transfer of production factors from restricted industries to supported industries, from disadvantaged enterprises to advantageous enterprises, utilize regional advantages, achieve optimal resource allocation, and ensure the smooth adjustment of the industrial structure. Relevant departments should also, based on the main content of this decision, quickly propose a list of obsolete products, formulate major measures for energy saving, material saving, and comprehensive utilization, and implement them after approval through a certain procedure.

(8) Township and village enterprises should implement national industrial policies, actively adjust product structures, and develop in a healthy and stable manner. Support township and village enterprises and small enterprises that process agricultural and sideline products, have external markets at both ends, produce energy and raw materials, and have good economic benefits; promote township and village enterprises that compete with state key enterprises for raw materials, cause serious pollution, and have poor economic benefits to transform or shut down. Guide township and village enterprises to produce supporting products for large enterprises, and under appropriate conditions, promote large enterprises to transfer some products or production processes to small enterprises, strengthen urban-rural specialized cooperation, and avoid duplicate construction.

(9) The people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities with separate plans should earnestly implement industrial policies. The planning departments at all levels are specifically responsible for organizing the implementation of industrial policies. The industrial and commercial administrative departments at all levels should conduct annual inspections and registrations, and through the issuance of business licenses, the determination of business scopes, and the handling of illegal behaviors, ensure the implementation of industrial policies. The statistical, supervisory, and auditing departments at all levels should periodically check and be responsible for feedback on the investment, credit, output value, taxes, market supply and demand, and other situations of various industries. They should communicate information with the planning, banking, and financial departments, strengthen the supervision and inspection of the implementation of industrial policies, and improve the information feedback and market monitoring systems.

(10) Strengthen and improve the legal system to constrain enterprise and market behaviors through laws and regulations, and enable economic supervision departments to exercise their supervisory functions in accordance with the law. Quickly formulate laws and regulations related to industrial policies.

All regions and departments should unify their understanding, cooperate closely, and take joint actions to ensure the implementation of the current industrial policies and macroeconomic control policies. For units and responsible persons who violate this decision, responsibility will be pursued, and economic penalties and administrative sanctions will be imposed according to the severity of the offense.

This decision is mainly formulated for the first and second industries and the production-oriented service sectors such as transportation, communications, and infrastructure. Industrial policies for other sectors of the tertiary industry will be formulated and issued separately.

This decision will be implemented by the State Planning Commission and will be responsible for interpretation.

　　国务院关于当前产业政策要点的决定
   （一九八九年三月十五日）
    制定正确的产业政策，明确国民经济各个领域中支持和限制的重点，是调整产业结构、进行宏观调控的重要依据。产业政策的制定和实施，有利于把改革与发展、计划与市场有机地结合起来，对于更好地贯彻执行改革和开放的总方针，保证当前治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序任务的顺利完成，促进我国国民经济的长期稳定发展，具有重要的意义。
    当前，我国社会的总需求大于社会的总供给，在产业结构上也存在着比较严重的问题。主要是加工产业生产能力过大，农业、能源、原材料和交通运输等基础产业生产能力不足；一般加工产业生产能力过大，高水平的加工能力不足；产业的地区分布不够合理，地区优势未能很好发挥；企业组织结构分散，生产集中度差，专业化水平低，许多企业之间的生产联系和协作配套组织得不好。这些问题，既影响我国资源的合理利用和配置，又妨碍经济的稳定发展和宏观效益的提高。必须从当前的实际情况出发，合理制定产业政策，在压缩和控制社会总需求的同时，下功夫调整和改造产业结构，以防止出现经济滞胀现象，在优化结构的基础上提高国民经济的素质和效益。当前和今后一个时期制定产业政策、调整产业结构的基本方向和任务是：集中力量发展农业、能源、交通和原材料等基础产业，加强能够增加有效供给的产业，增强经济发展的后劲；同时控制一般加工工业的发展，使它们同基础产业的发展相协调。
    　　　　一、制定当前产业政策的原则
    制定当前产业政策的原则是：
    第一，贯彻治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的方针，以产业政策为导向，加强宏观控制，指导市场发育，协调各方面行动，逐步缓解总需求与总供给、消费结构与产业结构的矛盾。
    第二，压缩和控制长线产品的生产和建设，增加和扩大短线产品的生产和建设。集中力量，首先把粮食、棉花、煤炭、电力、交通特别是铁路运输以及市场紧俏的轻纺产品的生产建设搞上去。
    第三，按照市场需求、产业关联、技术进步、创汇作用、经济效益等因素，安排好产业发展序列并制定相关的各项政策，明确支持什么，限制什么。同时，要妥善处理好重点产业与一般产业协调发展的关系，处理好生产要素存量调整与增量配置的关系，处理好产业总体配置与发挥地区优势的关系。
    第四，当前的产业政策要点是根据长远与近期结合、以近期为主的原则制定的。在治理整顿过程中，将视经济发展情况，对产业政策作相应调整。
    第五，产业政策的制定权在国务院。为了保证国家产业政策的实施，各部门和各省、自治区、直辖市及计划单列省辖市人民政府，应根据国家产业政策，结合本部门、本地区的特点，拟定实施办法，并报国务院备案。如果需要对国家产业政策作某些补充规定，须报国务院审批。省以下各级人民政府不再层层拟定实施办法。要处理好实行经济承包责任制和实施产业政策的关系。全国是一个统一的市场，各地必须执行国家的产业政策，不能因局部和短期利益而破坏国家的整体和长期利益。
    第六，产业政策的实施，要运用经济的、行政的、法律的和纪律的手段，同时加强思想政治工作。计划、财政、金融、税务、物价、外贸、工商行政管理等部门必须目标一致，协同动作，各项调节手段和措施要相互配套，服从治理、整顿的方针和实施产业政策的要求。
