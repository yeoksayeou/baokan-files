Tianjin City Conducts a Survey of Dangerous School Buildings in Primary and Secondary Schools

    Tianjin City's vice mayor in charge of education recently emphasized: "As long as there are hidden dangers in school buildings, classes must absolutely not be held inside."

    At a special meeting held to improve the conditions of rural primary and secondary schools, participants noted that two-thirds of the school buildings in the suburbs of Tianjin are newly constructed. They also recalled the tragic collapse of a building in Jixian County last year. The meeting decided to conduct a comprehensive survey of dangerous buildings by the end of this month and to strictly inspect newly constructed buildings.
