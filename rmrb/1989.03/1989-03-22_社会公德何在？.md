    Where is Social Public Morality?
    Some people deliberately throw unextinguished cigarette butts into mailboxes, causing letters to be burned. Similar incidents have occurred multiple times since last year, with nearly 200 letters burned, seriously damaging the normal rights of citizens. Those who do not uphold social public morality should be punished by law once discovered, regardless of whether harm has been caused.

    社会公德何在？
    有人故意将未熄灭的烟头丢入信筒内，致使信件被烧。类似事件从去年至今已发生多起，被烧信件近二百封，严重损坏了公民的正常权益。对这种不讲社会公德的人，一经发现，不论造成危害与否，都应绳之以法。
