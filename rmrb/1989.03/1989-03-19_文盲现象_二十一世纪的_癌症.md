Illiteracy is not a phenomenon unique to third-world countries. In industrialized nations, there are also many who cannot read or write. Some experts in Western Europe believe that in the information age, illiteracy has become "a real social disaster" and will become a "social cancer" by the 21st century.

Reports indicate that the United States has 26 to 70 million illiterates; 13% of British youth, 25% of people in France and Canada have difficulty reading and writing; in the Wallonia and Brussels regions of Belgium, there are 300,000 illiterates, and even in the Belgian military, 3% to 5% are illiterate.

These illiterates can be roughly divided into three categories. The first type is completely illiterate; the second type is semi-illiterate, recognizing some words but not understanding the meaning of sentences, recognizing numbers but unable to calculate; the third type is functional illiterates, who have attended school but have forgotten the reading and writing skills they learned.

Regardless of the type, the vast majority of illiterates are poor, long-term unemployed, or immigrants. The failure of school education is also a significant cause of illiteracy. In 1987, the French Secretary of State for Education revealed that 20% to 25% of sixth-grade primary school students still cannot read or write. This proportion is even higher in Belgium, at 30%. A European Parliament member from Belgium, Paul Maes, disclosed in a report that currently 5% of Europeans are functional illiterates, and by the year 2000, functional illiterates in Europe will account for 20% of the total population.

To address this worrying social phenomenon, the United Nations has decided to designate 1990 as the "International Year of Literacy."

### 文盲现象——二十一世纪的“癌症”

　　文盲现象——二十一世纪的“癌症”
    文盲并不是第三世界国家的特有现象。在工业化国家，目不识丁者也大有人在。西欧一些专家认为，在信息化社会，文盲现象已成为“一个真正的社会灾难”，到２１世纪将成为一个“社会癌症”。
    据报道，美国的文盲大军有２６００万—７０００万之众；英国１３％的青年、法国和加拿大２５％的人读写有困难；比利时瓦隆地区和布鲁塞尔地区的文盲有３０万，甚至在比利时军队中也有３％—５％的文盲。
    这些文盲大致分为３类。一种是全文盲；一种是半文盲，认识一些单词，但不懂句子的意思，认识数字但不会计算；第三种是功能性文盲，这些人进过学校，但后来把所学的读写知识全忘了。
    不管是哪一类文盲，绝大多数都是穷人、长期失业者和移民。学校教育的失效也是产生文盲的重要原因。法国教育国务秘书１９８７年曾透露，２０％—２５％的小学六年级学生还不会读和写。比利时的这一比例更高，为３０％。比利时的欧洲议员保尔·马克曾在一份报告中透露，目前有５％的欧洲人是功能性文盲，到２０００年，欧洲的功能性文盲将占总人口的２０％。
    为对付这一令人忧虑的社会现象，联合国已决定１９９０年为“国际扫盲年”。
