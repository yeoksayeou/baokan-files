**Editor's Note:** In recent times, there have been many people complaining, and fewer people giving encouragement. Some even believe that only complaining is "telling the truth," while encouragement is "talking nonsense." Those with such views might want to read the following conversation with the director of the Anhui Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources.

**Changing Perspectives to Address Issues**

**The Other Side of the Problem**

Let me tell you about the incident at the Anhui Geological Society's annual meeting last year. When analyzing the reasons for the severe shortage of geological exploration funds, someone said: The rate of increase in state funding for geological work is significantly lower than the rate of increase in state fiscal revenue. Someone else said: The prices of raw materials for geological production are rising, fixed costs are swelling rapidly, and wage expenditures are increasing daily... The more they talked, the more disheartened everyone felt. Unexpectedly, Song Weiping from the 332 Geological Team and Zeng Zhaohong from the Anhui Geological Workers' University spoke up against the prevailing opinion. They said:

"Yes, statistics show that for every 1 yuan invested in geological work by the state, 10 times the mineral production value is generated, 80 times the related industrial value, and 200 times the national income. The geological department's contributions are immeasurable. However, statistics also show that the cost of geological exploration is too high, and the exploration cycle is too long. Our exploration fees account for 20% of the mineral costs. The exploration cycle for medium-sized ore deposits generally takes 6 to 8 years, and for large deposits, it can take over 20 years.

"How well are geological exploration units managing scientifically and using funds rationally? Because the input-output ratio of geological work is not fixed, the state allows geological exploration units to use funds without compensation; the main indicators for evaluating the production and operation status of geological exploration units do not include key indicators such as funds and profits. This makes many geological exploration units compete to get investments, equipment, and materials from the state..."

With the change in perspective, those who already advocated for self-reflection became even more focused on tapping into the financial potential within the geological exploration units. Last year, all 167 geological projects in the bureau successfully implemented project management, with 55 projects bid out and 112 projects contracted out. The main physical work volume and technical economic indicators were all completed satisfactorily.

**Think About Our Advantages**

In 1985, when the Minister of the Ministry of Geology, Zhu Xunjian, proposed "opening up the geological market," I thought more about the disadvantages of the geological department, and the more I thought, the more discouraged I felt. Comrades advised me to try looking at it from a different angle and think about our own advantages: abundant labor force, concentrated geological technical personnel, matched construction methods, and a large inventory of equipment... Yes! We also have some conditions to venture into the geological market.

Last year, the bureau earned 22.9 million yuan from the geological market, a 58.7% increase over 1987. Part of this came from our use of small mine technical data and geological specialized equipment to jointly develop mines with local township enterprises.

The 322 Geological Team, located in Ma'anshan, made significant contributions to exploring raw materials for Ma Steel. However, most people in Ma'anshan do not know that there is a 322 Geological Team right next to them. The comrades from the 322 Geological Team are no longer just indignant and aggrieved. They say: This is clearly related to our past life in a closed system, lacking communication with society.

Starting last year, the 322 Geological Team, together with Ma Steel's Nan Shan Mine, Gu Shan Mine, and Ma'anshan Mining Research Institute, established the "Rock Survey Company." This company combines Nan Shan Mine's surveying technology, Gu Shan Mine's tunnel technology, and the mining research institute's design capabilities with the 322 Geological Team's surveying technology and equipment advantages, forming a strong surveying, design, and construction one-stop economic joint venture. It has already shown its strength in fierce competition.

**There Are Always Solutions**

The internal recruitment in the 1970s caused the proportion of surplus personnel in China's geological workforce to swell to 30% of the total workforce. By the 1980s, internal recruitment stopped, and the older children of geological workers were largely unemployed. To solve the problems of "reducing surplus" and employment difficulties, we must engage in diversified operations. Running a business requires people who are good at management, understand business, and are skilled in their field; however, the geological department is precisely lacking such a group of geological entrepreneurs.

"There are always ways to break this 'vicious circle,'" said the comrades from the 321 Geological Team: We should see that even the general labor force in geological exploration units, due to their long-term work in harsh outdoor environments, has cultivated a spirit of hard work and perseverance, and the ability to overcome difficulties.

I have been to the 321 Geological Team, and there is indeed a vibrant atmosphere there. Currently, 450 people in the team are engaged in diversified operations, accounting for 37% of the total workforce. Last year, they achieved a diversified operation value of 28 million yuan and realized a profit and tax of 7 million yuan.

　　改变视角看问题        
    ——安徽省地矿局局长余养力谈话录
    本报记者  鹿舫
    编者按：近一个时期，发牢骚的人多了，讲鼓劲话的人少了。有的人甚至认为，只有发牢骚才是“讲真话”，而鼓劲则是“讲空话”。有这种看法的人，不防读一读这位地矿局局长的谈话。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    　　　　问题的另一面
    我给你说说去年安徽地质学会年会上的事吧！在分析地质勘查资金严重不足的原因时，有人说：国家对地质工作拨款的增长速度明显低于国家财政收入的增长速度。有人说：地质生产的原材料价格不断上涨，固定费用急剧膨胀，工资开支日益增大……越说越叫人心灰意冷。不料３３２地质队宋伟平和省地质职工大学曾照虹等同志力排众议，他们说＿＿
    “是的，有统计资料表明：国家每１元钱的地质工作投资将产生１０倍的矿业产值，８０倍的相关工业值，２００倍的国民收入。地质部门功不可没。可是，同样有统计资料表明：地质勘探成本太高，勘探周期太长。我们的勘探费竟占矿产成本的２０％。中型矿床勘探周期一般都要６至８年，大型矿床有的要２０多年。
    “地勘单位科学管理和合理使用资金做得怎么样呢？由于地质工作的投入产出没有固定的比例，国家允许地勘单位无偿使用资金；考核地勘单位生产经营状况的主要指标中，也没有资金、利润等主要指标，这就使得许多地勘单位争着向国家要投资，要设备，要材料……”
    随着视角的改变，本来就主张反求诸己的同志更加着眼于挖掘地勘单位内部的资金潜力。去年，全局１６７个地质项目全部顺利地实行了项目管理，其中招标承包５５项，委托承包１１２项，主要实物工作量及技术经济指标都完成得较好。
    　　　　想想我们的优势
    １９８５年，地矿部部长朱训刚提出“开辟地质市场”那会儿，我对地质部门的劣势想得多，越想越没劲。同志们劝我不妨换一个侧面，想想自身的优势：劳动力充足，地质技术人员集中，施工手段配套，库存设备较多……对！我们也不是没有一点条件闯地质市场。
    去年全局从地质市场上获得收入２２９０多万元，比１９８７年增长５８．７％。其中有一部分便来源于我们用手中掌握的小矿山技术资料和地质专用设备与地方乡镇企业联合办矿。
    地处马鞍山的３２２地质队，为马钢探明原料做出了重大贡献。但是，大部分马鞍山人并不知道自己身边还有一个３２２地质队。对此，３２２地质队的同志今天不再只是气愤、委屈。他们说：这明显同我们以往生活于一个封闭系统，缺乏与社会交流大有关系。
    从去年起，３２２地质队与马钢南山矿、姑山矿、马鞍山矿山研究院联合成立了“岩石勘察公司”。这家公司把南山矿的测量技术、姑山矿的坑道技术以及矿山研究院的设计能力，与３２２地质队的勘查技术和装备优势结合到一起，形成了一个强有力的勘查、设计、施工一条龙经济联合体，现已在激烈竞争中初显身手。
    　　　　办法总还是有的
    ７０年代的内部招工，使我国地质职工中富余人员的百分比膨胀到占职工总数的３０％。到８０年代，内部招工停止了，地质职工的大儿大女又大量待业。要解决“消肿”、就业难题，就得开展多种经营。而办企业，就得有会经营、善管理、懂业务的人；然而地质部门正是缺乏这样的一批地质企业家。
    “突破这个‘怪圈’的办法总还是有的”，３２１地质队的同志说：我们应看到即便是地勘单位的一般劳动力，由于他们长期工作在野外艰苦环境中，也磨练出了吃苦耐劳的意志和克服困难的气质。
    我去过３２１地质队，那里确有一种奋发向上的氛围。目前全队有４５０人从事多种经营，占职工总数的３７％。去年，他们多种经营产值达２８０多万元，实现利税７０多万元。
