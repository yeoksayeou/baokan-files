Japan, known as a "technological powerhouse," continues to import foreign technology at an unabated pace, reflecting its ongoing reliance on foreign technology.

According to a recent report by the official Science and Technology Policy Research Institute, "1987 Annual Report on Technology Importation," Japan signed 2,709 new technology import contracts in the 1987 fiscal year (April 1987 to March 1988), an increase of 14.7% over the previous year.

By technological field, the most contracts were signed for electrical technology, totaling 1,074, accounting for 47% of the total. Next were mechanical technology with 386 contracts, accounting for 14.2%, and chemical technology with 287 contracts, accounting for 10.6%.

In the high-tech sector, Japan imported the most computer and software technology.

Since the 1980s, the number of import contracts has been increasing each year: 484 in 1983, 613 in 1984, 624 in 1985, 699 in 1986, and 946 in 1987, accounting for 34.9% of all technology import contracts in 1987. In particular, computer software technology increased from 409 contracts in 1983 to 837 contracts in 1987. This indicates that Japan places a high value on the development of computer technology, but in the field of computer software, Japan is still relatively backward and heavily reliant on imports.

The importation of semiconductor device manufacturing technology, which is closely related to computers, has also seen a significant increase in recent years: 61 contracts in 1983, 85 in 1984, 129 in 1985, 171 in 1986, and 260 in 1987.

The report by the Science and Technology Policy Research Institute states that Japan's technology importation has been on an upward trend since the 1950s. In terms of import methods, Japan has primarily used the approach of signing paid transfer contracts, which account for 94.3% of the total.

　　日本引进国外技术势头未减
    以签订有偿转让合同为基本引进方式
    新华社东京３月１６日电  （记者张可喜）日本号称“技术大国”，但引进国外技术势头至今未减，这反映了日本在技术上仍依赖国外的现状。
    据官方的科学技术政策研究所不久前公布的“１９８７年度技术引进概况”说，１９８７年度（１９８７年４月至１９８８年３月）日本引进技术的新合同为２７０９项，比前一年度增加１４．７％。
    按技术领域分类，电气技术引进合同为最多，共１０７４项，占合同总数的４７％；其次为机械技术３８６项，占总数的１４．２％，化工技术２８７项，占总数的１０．６％。
    在高技术领域里，日本引进最多的是电子计算机及软件技术。
    ８０年代以后，引进合同逐年增加，１９８３年度４８４项，１９８４年度６１３项，１９８５年度６２４项，１９８６年度６９９项。１９８７年度９４６项，占１９８７年度全部技术引进合同数的３４．９％。尤其是计算机软件技术，从１９８３年度的４０９项增加到１９８７年度的８３７项。这说明，日本高度重视电子计算机技术的发展，同时，在计算机软件方面，日本还比较落后，不得不在很大程度上依赖进口。
    与电子计算机有密切关系的半导体元器件制造技术的引进近年来也有大幅度增加：１９８３年度６１项，１９８４年度８５项，１９８５年度１２９项，１９８６年度１７１项，１９８７年度２６０项。
    科学技术政策研究所的报告说，日本引进技术从５０年代起一直呈增加趋势。从引进方式来看，基本上采取了签订有偿转让合同的办法，这种合同占总数的９４．３％。
