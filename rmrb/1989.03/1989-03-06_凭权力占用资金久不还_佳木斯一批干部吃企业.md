Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 5th.

Some officials in Jiamusi City have been using their authority to borrow production funds from enterprises for extended periods without repaying them.

According to a market and cash inspection team's investigation of 35 enterprises, it was found that 8 of these enterprises had their funds, totaling over 210,000 yuan, borrowed by 12 officials with real power. These funds were mainly used to purchase and build personal housing and to buy scarce commodities. Some of the funds have already been written off in the enterprises' management fees and entertainment expenses. It is understood that most of these officials who borrowed from enterprises are bureau and section-level leaders who can directly manage enterprises, and some are from law enforcement departments.

This situation has attracted the attention of relevant departments in the city, and investigations and handling are currently underway.

　　凭权力占用资金久不还
    佳木斯一批干部吃企业
    新华社哈尔滨３月５日电  佳木斯市一些党政机关干部利用职权长期借占企业生产资金。
    据市信贷、现金检查组对３５户企业的调查，发现其中有８户企业被１２名握有实权的机关干部借占资金２１万多元。这些款项主要被用于购买和建造个人住房和购买紧俏商品，有的已在企业管理费和招待费中核销。据了解，这些向企业伸手的干部大部分是能直接管企业的局、处级领导，有些还是执法部门的。
    这一情况已引起了市有关部门的重视，目前正在调查处理。
