Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, March 8th. Reporter Liu Kai Chen reports: On the occasion of International Women's Day, UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today issued a statement calling on countries around the world to redouble their efforts to ensure that women, who make up more than half of the world's population, have a more equal status in various social tasks.

De Cuéllar emphasized that only by utilizing the role of women can effective social and economic development be achieved.

After discussing the progress made in the world in the struggle for equal rights for women and in promoting women's participation in development, as well as the important role women play in defending world peace, de Cuéllar pointed out that there are still many women's issues that need to be addressed in the world, such as discrimination against women in society, unequal pay for equal work, women not having equal employment opportunities, and even the abuse of women in many countries.

The Secretary-General said that without financial and technological support for developing countries, without the expansion of trade in developing countries, the efforts of developing countries in the economic field will not be successful.

　　联合国秘书长呼吁
    提高妇女地位　发挥妇女作用
    本报联合国３月８日电  记者刘开宸报道：在国际妇女节之际，联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天发表声明，呼吁世界各国加倍努力，以保证占世界人口一半以上的妇女在社会各种任务中处于更加平等的地位。
    德奎利亚尔强调说，只有发挥妇女作用，才能取得有效的社会和经济发展。
    德奎利亚尔在谈了世界上争取妇女权利平等和促进妇女参加发展方面已经取得的进展以及妇女参与保卫世界和平的重要作用后指出，世界上尚有许多妇女问题需要解决，如社会上歧视女性、男女同工不同酬、妇女不能享受平等就业机会，甚至许多国家里虐待妇女等。
    这位秘书长说，不给发展中国家财政和技术支持，发展中国家的贸易不扩大，发展中国家在经济方面的努力是不会成功的。
