On the eve of the Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), members received a special gift—a compilation of the handling of proposals from the First Session of the Seventh CPPCC.

Since the First Session of the Seventh CPPCC, the Proposal Committee has taken various measures to help members improve the quality of their proposals. Specific actions include:

1. Selecting key proposals and organizing proposal makers to engage in democratic consultations with the units responsible for handling the proposals. Through these consultations, proposals are improved, and joint research is conducted to find solutions to problems. Proposals on the difficulty of publishing scientific and technological books and the disposal of urban garbage in Beijing have been effectively addressed through this method.

2. Timely gathering of members' opinions on the handling of proposals to enrich the content of the proposals. They sent a "Survey Form on Members' Opinions on the Handling of Proposals" to all members, collecting opinions from 178 members on the handling of 306 proposals. For proposals that members were dissatisfied with or had new suggestions and opinions based on the original proposals, they were promptly classified and forwarded to the relevant units for study and handling.

3. Summarizing experiences to improve work and help members better propose proposals.

The efforts of the Proposal Committee to deepen the proposal work have received enthusiastic responses from the members. Since the First Session of the Seventh CPPCC, 77.9% of the members have submitted 2,005 proposals, making it the session with the most proposals in the history of the CPPCC. By March 6 of this year, 99% of these proposals have been replied to.

　　帮助委员提高提案质量  政协提案委员会有措施
    本报北京３月１７日讯  记者费伟伟报道：在全国政协七届二次会议召开前夕，政协委员们收到了一份别致的礼物——七届一次会议《提案办理情况分类选编》。
    政协七届一次会议以来，提案委员会采取多种措施，努力帮助委员们提高提案质量，具体做法是：
    一、有重点地选择一些提案，组织提案人与提案承办单位开展民主协商对话活动，通过对话完善提案，共同研究找出解决问题的办法。委员提出的科技图书出版难、北京城市垃圾处理等提案，都通过这种方式得到较好解决。
    二、及时了解委员对提案办理情况的意见，充实提案内容。他们通过给全体委员寄发“委员提案办理情况意见征询表”的办法，收集到１７８位委员对３０６件提案的办理意见，对委员不满意的答复和在原提案的基础上又有新建议和意见的，及时分类整理，转送有关单位研究办理。
    三、总结经验改进工作，帮助委员更好地提出提案。
    提案委员会深化提案工作的努力，受到委员们的热情回答。七届一次会议以来，有７７．９％的委员提出了２００５件提案，是历届政协会议中提案最多的一年。到今年３月６日，这些提案已有９９％办复。
