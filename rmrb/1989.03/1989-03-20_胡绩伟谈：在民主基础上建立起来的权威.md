Edition: 6

Hu Jiewei, at the Symposium on Chinese Democratic Theory, said that democratic authority, which is authority established on a democratic basis, differs fundamentally from authoritarian power in the following ways:

	1. Decision-making must be democratized and scientified.
	2. Leaders must be produced and replaced strictly according to legal democratic procedures.
	3. The principle of democratic centralism must be upheld, strictly adhering to the principle of minority submission to the majority, while genuinely respecting and protecting the rights of the minority with differing opinions.
	4. Leaders must not only possess extensive knowledge and relatively high leadership skills, but they must also strictly adhere to discipline and integrity, becoming ideal leaders and trustworthy public servants in the eyes of the people.
	5. Decision-makers must set an example in execution to ensure that major decisions can be smoothly implemented.
	6. The democratic system for selecting and appointing officials must be upheld, emphasizing meritocracy and attracting talent.
	7. Decision-making and governance must be transparent, ensuring the people's right to know, right to discuss, and right to participate, placing the work of leadership organs and leaders completely under the supervision of the people.
	8. Legal construction must be strengthened to ensure that the entire country and society are governed by law, upholding the principle of equality before the law.

    胡绩伟谈：
    　　　　在民主基础上建立起来的权威
    胡绩伟在中国民主理论问题座谈会上说，民主的权威，即在民主基础上建立起来的权威与专制权威有根本性的不同：一、在决策上要求民主化和科学化。二、要求严格按照法定的民主程序产生和更换领导人员。三、坚持民主集中制，既严格遵守少数服从多数的原则，又认真尊重和保护持不同意见的少数。四、要求领导人不仅具有渊博的知识和比较高超的领导水平，而且要求他们严格遵纪守法，廉洁奉公，成为人民心目中比较理想的领袖和值得信赖的公仆。五、决策者在执行中发挥模范作用，以保证重大决策能够顺利贯彻执行。六、坚持选拔和使用干部的民主制度，任人唯贤，招贤纳智。七、决策、施政公开化，保证人民的知情权、议政权和参政权，把领导机关和领导人员的工作完全置于人民的监督之下。八、加强法制建设，使整个国家和社会都依法治理，坚持在法律面前人人平等。
