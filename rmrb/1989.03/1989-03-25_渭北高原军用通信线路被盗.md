Our unit is stationed in the Weibei Plateau, with national defense communication lines crisscrossing five nearby counties. In recent years, communication wires have frequently been stolen. According to incomplete statistics, in the past three years, our unit's national defense communication lines have been stolen 59 times, resulting in the loss of 63,000 meters of bare copper wire, 1,540 hours of communication interruption, and a direct economic loss of 82,000 yuan. This has seriously affected the unit's combat readiness and daily work. Our unit has repeatedly reported the incidents to the local public security departments and government, but no action has been taken. Now, the trend of stealing wires is getting worse, becoming a major issue in handling military-civilian relations. We hope that local governments and public security departments will severely crack down on those who damage military communication lines and ensure the smooth operation of national defense communication lines.

　　渭北高原军用通信线路被盗
    我部队驻扎在渭北高原，国防通信线路纵横附近５个县。近几年来，通讯电线经常被盗。据不完全统计，近三年来，我部队国防通信线路被盗５９次，损失铜裸线６．３万多米，通信中断计１５４０小时，直接经济损失８．２万元，严重影响了部队的战备值勤和日常工作。我部队曾多次向驻地公安部门和地方政府报案或反映情况，但都未得到处理。现在，偷盗电线之风愈演愈烈，已成为部队处理军民关系的一大难事。希望地方政府和公安部门严厉打击那些破坏军用通信线路的不法之徒，确保国防通信线路畅通无阻。
