Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 18th.

Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said today that if the problem of commercializing and industrializing scientific and technological achievements is well solved, China's economy will develop more smoothly and the cost will be lower.

Zhao Ziyang met this afternoon in Zhongnanhai with American businesspeople and experts attending the "Sino-American Science and Technology Commercialization, Innovation, and Economic Development Forum." He said that China urgently needs to apply scientific and technological strength to economic development. China has many scientific research achievements, but very few are applied to production. He said, "The Torch Program" is aimed at solving this problem, and the Central Committee supports this program.

The forum, attended by 22 businesspeople, experts, and professors from 11 American companies and their Chinese counterparts, was held in Beijing from March 13 to 17. Zhao Ziyang hopes that the scientific and technological communities and business circles of the two countries will strengthen cooperation in the high-tech field, establishing a mutually complementary and mutually beneficial relationship. He believes that if the advantages of both sides are combined, the results of cooperation will be more competitive.

George Kozmetsky, a professor from the University of Texas at Austin, praised the "Torch Program." He said that American businesspeople and experts are very willing to cooperate with China in the commercialization of scientific and technological achievements, and there are many good cooperation projects between the two countries. Song Jian was present at the meeting.

　　赵紫阳会见美国客人时说
    迫切需要把科技用于经济
    新华社北京３月１８日电  （记者柴世宽）中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天说，科技成果商品化、产业化的问题如果解决得好，中国的经济会发展得更顺利一些，付出的代价会少一些。
    赵紫阳今天下午在中南海会见出席“中美科技商品化、创新与经济发展讨论会”的美国企业家、专家时说，中国迫切需要把科技力量用于经济发展。中国的科研成果不少，而应用到生产方面的却很少。他说，“火炬计划”就是为了解决这个问题，中央对这个计划是支持的。
    来自１１家美国公司的２２位企业家、专家、教授和中国同行参加的这次讨论会于３月１３日至１７日在北京举行。赵紫阳希望两国科技界和企业界加强在高科技领域的合作，建立一种互相补充、取长补短的关系。他表示相信，双方的优势如果加在一起，将会使合作的成果具有更强的竞争力。
    美国得克萨斯州大学奥斯汀总校的乔治·柯兹默茨斯教授对“火炬计划”表示赞赏。他说，美国企业家和专家很愿意同中国开展科技成果商品化方面的合作，两国间有很多好的合作项目。宋健会见时在座。
