The Bank of China will begin issuing 1 billion yuan in financial bonds to urban and rural residents nationwide starting from April.

The bonds have terms of one to three years. For bonds maturing in one and two years, the interest rates are 13.34% and 14.24%, respectively, which are 0.2 percentage points higher than the corresponding savings deposit rates. For bonds maturing in three years, the interest rate is based on the savings deposit rate plus the price adjustment subsidy rate, with an additional 0.1 percentage points. If the savings deposit rates are adjusted upward, the financial bond interest rates will be adjusted accordingly. The bonds can be transferred, and the interest income is exempt from personal income tax.
