Strange Incident: Watching Videos to Enter the Station

This is a strange incident that occurred on February 2 at the Daxian Railway Station in Sichuan.

At 10:40 AM, the train from Zhengzhou to Chongqing, Train No. 283, arrived at Daxian Railway Station. The door to the ticket checking area in the waiting room was locked, and there was no announcement that the train had arrived. The passengers thought the train was delayed and waited anxiously. After waiting for a while, I couldn't hold it in any longer and asked a service staff member:

"When will Train No. 283 arrive?"

"It has already arrived."

"Why aren't we allowed to enter the station?"

"Go in from over there."

The service staff member replied while pointing to the "Travelers' Home" next to the waiting room. When the passengers, feeling indignant, arrived at the "Travelers' Home," another service staff member shouted: "Buy tickets, buy tickets, 3.5 yuan each to watch a video." The passengers discussed among themselves: "Even at the doorstep of 'home,' we still get a knock on the head." To enter the station, people had to pay 0.35 yuan as a "toll" to pass through the "Travelers' Home" and board the train.

The "Travelers' Home" did have two televisions, but there was no sign of any video being played. It is unknown whether this was a one-time event or a new "business venture" added by the Daxian Railway Station.

### 进站要看录像，怪事！

　　进站要看录像，怪事！
    这是２月２日发生在四川达县火车站的一桩怪事。
    上午１０时４０分，从郑州开往重庆的２８３次列车到达达县火车站。候车室检票处的门紧锁着，广播也没通知火车已经进站。旅客们只当是火车晚点了，焦急地在候车室等着。等了一会儿，我实在是憋不住了，去问服务员：
    “２８３次车什么时候到？”
    “已经到了”。
    “为什么不让进站？”
    “从那边进。”
    服务员一边回答着，一边指着候车室旁边的“旅客之家”。当旅客们气冲冲来到“旅客之家”时，一个服务员嚷道：“买票，买票，三毛五一张，看录像。”旅客们议论：“到了‘家’门口还要被敲一记竹杠。”为了进站，人们只好掏０．３５元的“买路钱”，通过旅客之家进站上车。
    “旅客之家”倒有两台电视机，但没见要放录像的样子。不知这是偶然的事件，还是达县火车站新增加的“经营项目”。
