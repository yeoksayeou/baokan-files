Wang Jiaxiang was one of the senior revolutionaries of the proletariat and an outstanding leader of the Chinese Communist Party. He spent his childhood in his hometown of Jing County, Anhui. During his youth, he studied in Nanling County and Wuhu City. Initially, he was a weak scholar who had received feudal and bourgeois education. Just as he entered his youth, he joined the revolutionary movement. Through long and complex struggles, he transformed from an ordinary young student into a loyal and steadfast communist warrior, and then became an important figure on the national and international political stage, adding luster to his country and hometown. As his family member, comrade-in-arms, and student, although I have walked with him through many twists and turns, endured persecution and hardships with him, I have always been proud of him. Even though he has left us, his thoughts and image continue to exist in our work and lives.

Wang Jiaxiang's personal growth is closely tied to the development history of the Chinese Communist Party and its people's army. However, due to various reasons, especially his own consistent humility and caution, his revolutionary deeds and moral character are little known to people, and even more so to the new generation. Now, the Anhui Youth and Children's Publishing House in his hometown plans to publish a book about his life story for young readers. I fully support and endorse this initiative and believe it is very necessary. I immediately recommended Comrade Lu Hong to write this book.

Lu Hong has long been familiar with and studied Wang Jiaxiang's experiences and related party history. He has done a lot of work with me to introduce and promote Wang Jiaxiang's deeds. A few years ago, he helped Wang Jiaxiang's old comrade-in-arms, Comrade Wu Xiuguan, compile a memoir of several hundred thousand words, in which many parts mention Wang Jiaxiang. Later, he helped me revise and polish "Wang Jiaxiang Literary Biography: Dawn and Twilight," and visited Wang Jiaxiang's hometown, alma mater, and some old comrades. I am very familiar with and admire his literary talent, historical knowledge, and serious attitude. His new work does not disappoint, being both vivid and simple, touching and true, and well-documented. To meet the needs of young readers and a wider audience, he has selected and concentrated the originally scattered historical facts and dry historical materials, and added some necessary descriptions of the characters' personalities and the environment of the time. This not only makes Wang Jiaxiang's image more vivid and prominent but also vividly recreates some major historical events and important historical figures. Although I am a witness to many of the old friends and events in the book, I am still attracted and moved by the descriptions, as if I have returned to those unforgettable years.

Because I am the closest and most familiar with Wang Jiaxiang, I know that his personality is relatively introverted and calm. Moreover, he worked in high-level leadership organizations for a long time, and his life was relatively monotonous and stable. He is neither like Marshal Chen Yi, who expresses his joys and sorrows openly, nor like General Peng Dehuai, who is fierce and unyielding with remarkable achievements. It is not easy to write him vividly. Therefore, although some parts of the book are written briefly and some important deeds are not mentioned, the author has indeed worked hard to achieve the current state. Some shortcomings are due to limited materials and space constraints, which seem to be unavoidable. As Wang Jiaxiang's family member, I deeply appreciate the author's hard work and believe that the publication of this book will help young people understand history, learn from predecessors, inherit traditions, and realize the revolutionary ideals that the older generation has fought for all their lives.

　　《王稼祥一生》序
    王稼祥同志是我国的老一辈无产阶级革命家和中国共产党的优秀领导人之一。他在故乡安徽泾县度过了自己的童年时代，青少年时期，曾在南陵县和芜湖市求学，最初只是一个受过封建主义和资产阶级教育的文弱书生。刚进入青年时期，他就投身革命运动，在长期的尖锐复杂的斗争中，他从一个普通的青年学生，锻炼成长为一个忠诚而坚强的共产主义战士，又成为我国以至国际政治舞台上的一个重要活动家，为自己的祖国和家乡增添了光辉。我作为他的亲人、战友和学生，虽然曾陪着他走过不少坎坷曲折的路，并为他受过迫害、吃过苦头，但我一直为他感到自豪，即使他已先我而去，他的思想和形象却一直存在于我们的事业和生活中。
    稼祥的个人成长史与中国共产党及其人民军队的发展史是紧紧地联系在一起的。但是由于种种原因，特别是他本人一贯的谦虚谨慎，他的革命事迹和思想品德，却很少为人了解，新一代人对他则更为陌生了。现在，稼祥故乡安徽少年儿童出版社，要为青少年读者出版一本关于他生平故事的书，我非常赞成和支持，认为这是十分必要的，并且马上推荐卢弘同志来写作这本书。
    卢弘对稼祥的经历以及有关的党史，早就有所了解和研究，曾和我共同为介绍宣传稼祥的事迹做过不少工作。几年前他就为稼祥的老战友伍修权同志整理出了几十万字的回忆录，其中不少地方都写到了稼祥，后来他又帮助我对《王稼祥文学传记·黎明与晚霞》作了修改润色，还访问过稼祥的故乡、母校和一些老同志。对于他的文学才能、党史知识和认真态度，我十分了解和赞赏。他的这本新作，果然不负所望，既写得生动朴实、真切感人，又做到事有所据、人如其貌。他为了能适应青少年和更多的读者的需要，将本来比较平散的史实和枯燥的史料，作了取舍和集中加工，对人物的性格风貌和当时的环境气氛，也作了些必要的渲染描绘。这不仅使稼祥的形象更为鲜明突出，而且也生动地再现了一些重大历史事件和重要历史人物。我虽然是书中出现的许多故人往事的见证人，但看了也不时被其描写所吸引和感动，似乎一下子又回到了那些难忘的年代。
    由于我对稼祥最为亲近和熟悉，深知他的性格比较内向沉静，加之长期在高级领导机关工作，生活相对地较为单调平稳，既不像陈毅元帅那样嬉笑怒骂形之于色，又不似彭德怀老总那样刚烈倔强战功赫赫，要把他写像写活不太容易。所以书中有的地方虽然写得比较简略，有些重要事迹还没有写到，但是作者能够写成现在这个样子，看来已经很费了一番功夫；部分不足之处，由于资料有限和篇幅所限，似乎也只能如此了。我作为稼祥的亲人，对于作者的辛勤劳动，表示深切感谢，并且相信，这本书的出版，将有助于青少年了解历史、学习先辈、继承传统并实现老一辈终生为之奋斗的革命理想。
