    Depicting Social Diversity and Showcasing the Difficulties of Reform: Tianjin Releases the TV Series "Potential"
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 13th.

    Reform is difficult, and artistically portraying reform is even more challenging. The bold and decisive reformer, Jiao Guangpu, once stirred the hearts of many, but the reformers in the TV series "Potential," recently completed by the Tianjin Film Studio, lack some of his sharpness and have a bit more cunning—showing a bit more flexibility. Unlike the reform advocates like Jiao Guangpu, "Potential" tells the story of a state-owned ceramics factory facing the relentless pressure of individual enterprises, and how it struggles to survive and develop. The narrative delves into the challenges of conducting reform in China. Naturally, "Potential" does not provide a magical solution to these problems, but it vividly portrays the diverse social landscape of the commodity economy era. No wonder some film and television critics say that "Potential" is worth watching, both in terms of its thoughtfulness and artistic merit.

　　描绘社会百态展示改革困难
    天津推出电视剧《潮中行》
    本报讯  记者向兵报道：改革难，艺术地表现改革更难。大刀阔斧革除旧弊的乔光朴，曾激动了多少人的心，而天津电影厂刚拍成的电视剧《潮中行》中的改革者与之相比，就少了几分锐气，多了一点狡黠——略显圆滑的灵活性。和呼唤改革的乔光朴们不同，《潮》讲述一个国营陶瓷厂面临潮水般进逼的个体企业的冲击，怎样生存发展的故事。笔触伸向改革本身，展示了在中国进行改革的诸般困难。自然，《潮》不可能对如何解决这些顽症开出灵丹妙药，但它毕竟将商品经济时代纷繁的社会百态作了生动的描绘。难怪一些影视评论家说，无论从思想性、艺术性上，《潮》都值得一看。
