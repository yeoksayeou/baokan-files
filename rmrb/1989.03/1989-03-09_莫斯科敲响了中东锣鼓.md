Moscow Strikes Up the Middle East Drums
Qin Dianjie

Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze traveled to five Middle Eastern countries and returned to Moscow last week. During his 10-day visit, he was extremely busy, even holding talks with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres in Cairo. In his first stop in Damascus, he proposed a new Soviet initiative to convene a Middle East peace conference in three stages. Moscow's diplomatic offensive in the Middle East is indeed intense.

This trip is the first time in 15 years that a Soviet foreign minister has visited the Middle East. Some have called it a "Soviet return to the Middle East," aiming to use "new thinking" to create a new situation in the Middle East. This visit not only improved bilateral relations with countries like Egypt, expanded and strengthened Soviet influence and status, but also, as a "fair mediator," showed that Moscow wants to play a more active role in the Middle East peace process. Since the deterioration of Soviet-Egyptian relations in 1972, the Soviet Union has been in a "low-key" state in the Middle East and has been marginalized by Washington in solving the Middle East problem. Now, Moscow is unwilling to be pushed out of the Middle East and unwilling to play a supporting role; it wants to show its skills and take the lead. Shevardnadze repeatedly stated: "The Soviet Union has indisputable geographical, historical, and political ties with this region"; "The United States has the opportunity to engage in dialogue with both Israel and the Arab countries, and the Soviet Union also has this opportunity"; he emphasized firmly: "Without the Soviet Union, there can be no Middle East peace"; he also called out loudly, "We should stop driving the other side out of the Middle East region." His target is quite clear.

The Soviet foreign minister painted a rather poetic picture of this Middle East trip: "The cold and rainy weather has passed, and the first buds have appeared on the branches." The Soviet Union's self-satisfaction with its return to the center of the Middle East stage is evident. It seems that compared to U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz's four unsuccessful shuttle visits to the Middle East last year, Moscow has gained a few points. The reasons are: first, the Soviet Union withdrew its troops from Afghanistan on schedule, which was widely welcomed internationally, improving its image; second, it chose the right time: President Bush had just taken office, and there were many things to attend to, leaving little time to focus on the Middle East issue. Thus, the Moscow authorities, two days after withdrawing from Afghanistan, arranged this diplomatic battle to compete for Middle East leadership.

Moscow's Middle East drums have shaken Washington. President Bush responded publicly: "We must limit the role the Soviet Union plays, and this is already a competition." Shevardnadze denied that the Soviet Union wants to compete with the United States for influence in the region and accused "such talk of injecting an undesirable hostile element." However, the facts vividly show that this is just a cover-up. Western journalists vividly depicted this struggle as: "While Bush is reviewing and evaluating foreign policy and unable to come up with new proposals, Gorbachev has grabbed the ball and is running with it." "Currently, it seems there is a vacuum in American (Middle East) action, allowing Shevardnadze to step forward."

The easing of tensions does not mean that everything is settled and peaceful; it will still stir up waves of competition. With Moscow striking up the Middle East drums again, the Middle East stage will open the curtain for a contest between the Soviet Union and the United States, and the best is yet to come.

### 莫斯科敲响了中东锣鼓

　　莫斯科敲响了中东锣鼓
    秦殿杰
    苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽仆仆风尘地走访了中东５国，上周回到莫斯科。在１０天访问中，他忙得不亦乐乎，其间在开罗还穿插了同巴解主席阿拉法特、以色列外长阿伦斯的会谈。他在第一站大马士革就提出了苏联分三个步骤召开中东和会的新建议，莫斯科在中东展开的外交攻势真可谓紧锣密鼓。
    谢氏此行是１５年来苏联第一位外长出访中东。有人称它是“苏联重返中东”之举，旨在以“新思维”开创它在中东的新局面。此行不仅改善了同埃及等阿拉伯国家的双边关系，扩大和增强了苏联的影响和地位，而且以“公正调解人”的身份显示出莫斯科要在中东和平进程中发挥更积极的作用。自１９７２年苏联和埃及的关系恶化以来，苏联在中东一直处在一种“低调状态”，在解决中东问题上一直受到华盛顿的排挤。而今，莫斯科不甘心被挤出中东圈外，也不甘心充当配角，它要施展本领争当主角。谢瓦尔德纳泽一再申明：苏联“与该地区有无可争议的地理、历史及政治联系”；“美国是有机会既同以色列、也同阿拉伯国家进行对话的，苏联也同样有这种机会”；他斩钉截铁地强调：“没有苏联就不可能有中东和平”；他还大声疾呼，应当停止“把对方从中东地区撵出去”。其矛头所指十分明显。
    苏联外长对此次中东之行描绘出一幅颇有诗意的图景：“严寒和阴雨连绵的天气已经过去，枝头上已出现了第一批花蕾”。苏联对于重登中东舞台中心的洋洋自得之态，跃然纸上。看来，同美国国务卿舒尔茨去年４次穿梭中东无果而终相比，莫斯科又赢了几分。究其原因，一是苏联如期从阿富汗全部撤军，在国际上受到普遍欢迎，形象有所改善；二是选择了良机：布什总统入主白宫伊始，千头万绪，尚无暇顾及中东问题。于是，莫斯科当局在从阿富汗脱身两天之后，就安排了这场争夺中东主导权的外交战。
    莫斯科敲响的中东锣鼓震动了华盛顿。布什总统作出了公开反应：“必须限制苏联所起的作用，这已经是竞争了。”谢氏则否认苏联要同美国竞相争夺在这一地区的影响，并指责“这种话注入了一种不可取的敌对成分”。然而事实却生动地表明这不过是欲盖弥彰的做法。西方记者形象地描绘这一争斗是：“当布什正在进行回顾与估价对外政策而无法提出新建议时，戈尔巴乔夫已把球抓在手里，并带球奔跑。”“目前，看来有一个美国（在中东的）行动真空，而让谢瓦尔德纳泽站到了前面。”
    缓和潮流并不意味着万事大吉、天下太平，它仍会掀起争夺的波澜。随着莫斯科重新敲响的中东锣鼓，中东舞台将拉开苏、美争夺的帷幕，好戏还在后头哩。
