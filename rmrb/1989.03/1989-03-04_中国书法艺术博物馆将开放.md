The Chinese Calligraphy Art Museum, which can be compared to the Xi'an Stele Forest, will open to the public on May 1st this year.

Xi'an is an ancient capital of China, rich in bronze inscriptions and stone steles. It houses a collection of calligraphic treasures from primitive communal inscriptions and pottery texts, Zhou and Qin dynasty stone drums, to the world-renowned Stele Forest. Since liberation, the municipal cultural relics department has collected and organized thousands of calligraphic rubbings, seals, tiles, bronze mirrors, bells, and tripods from the Neolithic era to the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, as well as nearly a thousand precious calligraphic works and manuscripts by famous calligraphers throughout history. To promote national culture, Xi'an has established the Chinese Calligraphy Art Museum.

　　中国书法艺术博物馆将开放
    可与西安碑林比肩的西安中国书法艺术博物馆，将于今年５月１日对外开放。
    西安是我国历史古都，钟鼎碑碣极为丰富。荟萃了从原始公社的印陶文字、周秦的石鼓到享誉世界的碑林书法精品。解放以来，市文物系统搜集整理了上至半坡时代的陶文拓本，下至唐宋元明清各代的数千件书法拓片、印玺、瓦当、铜镜、钟鼎等珍贵文物、书法资料和历代名家的墨迹珍品近千件。为了弘扬民族文化，西安市成立了中国书法艺术博物馆。　　　　　　　（王石平）
