During the seventh session of the National People's Congress, the reporter wrote a report titled "Jiangxi Acknowledges the 'Crisis,'" which mainly reflected the situation where the "leftist" and "factional" elements hindered Jiangxi's development. This time, the delegates from Jiangxi to the National People's Congress told the reporter that Jiangxi had risen from reflection in the past year and hoped the reporter would write a sequel.

	Where Does Cohesion Come From?

	"Where does cohesion come from? Jiangxi's approach is: first, to carry out a big discussion on the standard of productivity, so that the entire province can set its goals on developing productivity, promoting reform, and revitalizing Jiangxi; second, to eliminate internal friction, strengthen party spirit, and overcome factionalism." This is the consensus of many delegates. It is reported that last year, the provincial party committee invested a lot of effort in the discussion on the standard of productivity and in "strengthening unity and overcoming internal friction."

	Mao Zhiyong, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee, pointed out that personal grievances should all be thrown into Poyang Lake. For members of the leading group, if there are problems or opinions, they should be discussed face-to-face, not whispered behind the scenes or tripped up underfoot. For some leading groups below that have been quarreling over principles for a long time, decisive measures should be taken, removing those who should be removed and transferring those who should be transferred, without any hesitation. Deputy Governor Jiang Zhuping, a delegate to the National People's Congress, said: "Now the people evaluate: the fortress within the battle has begun to become a fortress in the battle."

	Old Songs Sing the "Internationale"

	Facing the powerful impact of economic development along the coast, the people of the Jiangxi Soviet area say that the old songs will still sing the "Internationale," relying not on gods or emperors, but on self-reliance.

	Jiangxi's southern gateway—Gannan—faces Guangdong, Fujian, and other coastal regions. The implementation of the coastal development strategy has caused agricultural by-products, timber, and mineral products here to flow eastward and southward. This impact is difficult for Gannan's economy to bear in the short term. Should the door be closed, or opened? In the face of new impacts, should one blame heaven and others, or face difficulties head-on? The provincial party committee and government promptly decided to "meet release with release, meet activity with activity," adopting a policy of "support, follow-up, and replacement" towards the coastal development of the export-oriented economy, turning new impacts into new opportunities, opening the southern gate, and revitalizing Jiangxi. It was decided that Gannan would be an experimental zone for economic reform, and at the same time, 18 counties bordering Fujian and Guangdong would be pilot areas for expanded powers. This way, the initiative was gained, entering the big market, participating in big competition. On the 400-kilometer border with Fujian and Guangdong, more than 100 markets were opened, 189 checkpoints obstructing circulation were abolished, and 300,000 farmers entered the circulation sector. The results have been remarkable in one year. The gross national product increased by 12.4% over the previous year, fiscal revenue increased by 27%, and farmers' per capita income increased by 73 yuan. Zhang Yunchuan, a delegate to the National People's Congress and the head of the Gannan Administrative Office, said: "This is the first time in Gannan's history, a big change in one year, and the people have tasted the sweetness of reform, opening up, and revitalization."

	Governor Wu Guanzheng emphasized to the reporter that Jiangxi is both the hinterland of the coast and the frontline of the hinterland. While "meeting release with release, meeting activity with activity" in coastal development, Jiangxi strengthens macro-control and management. Jiangxi has always considered the overall situation, using its advantages in agriculture and mineral resources to support coastal development; the coast also uses its advantages in funds and technology to help Jiangxi's economic revitalization. Jiangxi and coastal economies complement each other, benefiting each other. Considering the overall situation and local interests is what is called "Jiangxi-accented Mandarin."

	Walking the Path of Agricultural Industrialization

	Huang Hong, a delegate to the National People's Congress and vice governor, said to the reporter: "I think the biggest change in Jiangxi is that it has analyzed Jiangxi's actual situation and further clarified Jiangxi's development strategy, first developing the central region and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, connecting east and west, and crossing south and north, while opening the southern gate (Gannan) and the northern port (Jiujiang), focusing on the construction of Jiujiang; the entire Jiangxi economic building is established on the foundation of agriculture, taking the path of agricultural industrialization."

	Shu Huiguo, a delegate to the National People's Congress and an agricultural expert, detailed the reasons for Jiangxi to take the path of agricultural industrialization. He said, "Jiangxi's slow development is ultimately a fiscal problem. Therefore, Jiangxi must adjust its economic structure and develop industries that are suitable for Jiangxi's situation, with high tax and profit creation, and industries with high tax and profit are all based on agricultural products as raw materials, so developing agriculture is not only about solving the 'vegetable basket' and 'rice bowl' projects. When agriculture develops, it will drive the entire industry to take off."

	"Breaking Through from the Backward Link"

	Wu Guanzheng believes that talent is the foundation of entrepreneurship. And to attract talent, one must start from the "root"—education.

	Awareness leads to action. The Jiangxi Provincial Government issued a document, stipulating that funds would be raised from 13 channels, emphasizing the prominent position of basic education and technical education; emphasizing the coordination of general education, vocational education, and adult education, implementing the "Liaoyuan Plan" in 23 counties, and quickly converting the scientific research achievements of universities into productivity... A delegate from Jiangxi said well: "Jiangxi breaks through from the backward link and can walk out of the 'crisis' to welcome hope!"

### 江西从“危机”中奋起

　　江西从“危机”中奋起
    本报记者  高新庆
    去年七届人大一次会议期间，记者曾写过一篇通讯《江西意识到“危机”》，着重反映了一“左”二“派”阻碍江西发展的情况。这次会上，江西的全国人大代表告诉记者，去年一年，江西在反思中奋起，希望记者写一个续篇。
    　　　　凝聚力从哪里来？
    “凝聚力从哪里来？江西的做法是：第一，开展生产力标准的大讨论，使全省都把目标定在发展生产力、搞好改革、振兴江西上；第二，消除内耗，增强党性，克服派性。”这是许多代表的共识。据反映，去年省委在生产力标准讨论和“加强团结、克服内耗”上下了很大功夫。
    江西省委书记毛致用指出，要把个人恩恩怨怨，统统丢到鄱阳湖中去。班子成员有问题有意见，当面鼓对面锣，不在背后叽叽喳喳，不在脚下使绊子。对下面某些长期闹无原则纠纷的班子，则采取果断措施，该撤的撤，该调的调，毫不手软。人大代表、常务副省长蒋祝平说：“现在群众评价：堡垒里的战斗，开始变成战斗中的堡垒了。”
    　　　　老俵又唱《国际歌》
    面对沿海经济发展所产生的强大冲击波，江西苏区人民说，老俵仍然要唱《国际歌》，不靠神仙和皇帝，全凭自己救自己。
    江西的南大门——赣南，面对广东、福建等沿海地区。沿海发展战略的展开，使这里的农副产品、木材、矿产品形成东进南下的大流向。这种冲击，赣南经济一时难以承受。门是关，还是开？对新的冲击，是怨天尤人，还是迎难而上？江西省委、省政府及时决定“以放对放，以活对活”，对沿海发展外向型经济采取“支持、跟进、接替”的方针，变新冲击为新机遇，敞开南门，搞活江西。决定赣南作为经济改革的试验区，同时对与闽粤接壤的１８个县搞扩权试点。这样一来，赢得了主动，进入大市场，参与大竞争。在闽粤４００多公里边界上开放上百个集市，撤销了１８９个阻碍流通的关卡，３０万农民进入流通领域，一年来成效显著。去年国民生产总值比上年增长１２．４％，财政收入增长２７％，农民人均一年增收７３元。人大代表、赣南行署专员张云川说：“这在赣南是开天辟地第一回，一年大变，人民尝到了改革、开放、搞活的甜头。”
    省长吴官正对记者强调，江西是沿海腹地，又是腹地前沿。沿海开发，江西在“以放对放，以活对活”的同时，加强宏观调控和管理。江西一贯顾全大局，以农业和矿产等资源优势，支持沿海发展；沿海也以资金和技术优势帮助江西经济振兴，江西和沿海经济互补、互利互惠。顾全大局，兼顾地方利益，这就叫“带江西口音的普通话”。
    　　　　走农业工业化路子
    人大代表、副省长黄璜对记者说：“我以为江西最大的变化是分析了江西的实际，进一步明确江西的发展战略，首先发展中部、浙赣线，贯通东西，横贯南北，同时开放南门（赣南）、北港（九江），重点建设九江；整个江西经济大厦建立在农业基础之上，走农业工业化路子。”
    人大代表、农业专家舒惠国详细阐明江西走农业工业化路子的理由。他说，“江西发展慢，归根到底是个财政问题。所以江西要调整经济结构，发展适合江西情况，创利创税比较大的行业，而税利大的，都是以农产品为原料的行业，所以发展农业不仅是解决‘菜篮子工程’、‘饭碗工程’。农业上去了，会带动整个工业起飞。”
    　　　　“从落后环节突破”
    吴官正认为，人才是创业之本。而抓人才，要从“根”——教育抓起。
    有觉悟才有行动。江西省政府发文，规定从１３个渠道筹措资金，强调把基础教育、技术教育放在突出地位；强调抓好普教、职教、成教“三教统筹”，在２３个县实施“燎原计划”，高校科研成果尽快转化为生产力……江西一位代表说得好：“江西从落后环节突破，就能走出‘危机’迎来希望！”
