Nearly 300 blind, deaf, and physically disabled performers from across the country, representing over a dozen ethnic groups, showcased their talents on the capital's stage. The second National Disabled Persons' Art Festival, known for its unique artistic appeal, opened in Beijing last night.

The festival, jointly organized by the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Ministry of Culture, and the China Disabled Persons' Federation, is competitive in nature. Prior to this, 29 provinces and municipalities held preliminary performances or selections, with outstanding programs gathered in six performance areas. The programs participating in this festival in Beijing are a collection of the best in disabled persons' art. A panel of experts from the capital's arts community will evaluate and award performance prizes, creation prizes, guidance prizes, and team excellence prizes.

In recent years, disabled persons' artistic activities in China have seen significant development. Despite facing immense difficulties in life and work, many disabled individuals remain passionate about art. Facing life's misfortunes, these disabled individuals seek perfection in their imperfections and play strong tunes in their misfortunes. In September 1987, their performances graced the stage of the first National Arts Festival. Disabled artists also visited the United States, Japan, Yugoslavia, Hong Kong, and other countries and regions. The mute performance by deaf-mute actors from Hunan, "Melody and Noise," won the highest award, the International Friendship Gold Medal, at the sixth Brno International Mime Festival in Czechoslovakia.

Most of the participants in the festival, except for a few performers, are making their first trip to Beijing. Two farmers, both of whom lost a leg in an accident, overcame immense challenges to perform a lively "Eagle Disco" using only one leg. A girl afflicted with polio sang passionately about her love for life and her country in "Ode to Light." Some audience members came with sympathy and pity but left inspired and motivated.

　　残缺中寻求完美　厄运中奏响强音
    第二届全国残疾人艺术调演开幕
    本报北京３月８日讯  记者赖仁琼报道：来自全国十几个民族的近３００名盲人、聋人、肢残人演员在首都舞台一展风姿。具有独特艺术感染力的第二届残疾人艺术调演昨晚在京开幕。
    民政部、文化部和中国残联共同举办的艺术调演具有比赛性质。在这之前，全国２９个省市分别进行了调演或选拔，优秀节目汇集到六大演区。此次进京参加调演的节目是残疾人艺术的荟萃，由首都文艺界专家组成的评委会将从中评出表演奖、创作奖、辅导奖和团体优胜奖。
    我国残疾人艺术活动近几年有了较大发展。不少残疾人在生活、工作极为艰难的情况下仍然充满着对艺术的渴望和追求。直面人生不幸的残疾人于残缺中寻求完美，在厄运中奏响强音。１９８７年９月，他们的节目登上了第一届中国艺术节的舞台。残疾人组成的艺术团还出访了美国、日本、南斯拉夫、香港等国家和地区。湖南聋哑人表演的哑剧小品《旋律与噪音》在第六届捷克斯洛伐克布鲁诺国际哑剧节获最高奖——国际友谊金奖。
    参加调演的残疾人除个别演员外，大部分是首次进京。同在事故中受伤而单腿高位截肢的两位农民，克服了常人难以想象的困难，用单腿跳起了节奏轻快的《雄鹰迪斯科》。身患小儿麻痹的姑娘，声情并茂地唱出了热爱生活、歌颂祖国的《光明颂》。有的观众带着同情、怜悯而来，但却受到激励、鼓舞。
