The snake is the totem of the Yellow Emperor's clan, which is the earliest Chinese ethnic group. During the process of ethnic integration and development, it later evolved into the dragon, becoming a symbol of the nation. Its original form is the snake, which can be traced back to the snake swallowing a sacred herb depicted on a colored pottery dish unearthed from the Xia site in Taosi, Shaanxi, dating back over 4,000 years. This can be considered the earliest artistic prototype. It later evolved into the coiled dragon on bronze vessels from the Shang and Zhou dynasties.

The cultural origin of the Yellow Emperor's clan is in the Yellow River Basin of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and northern Gansu. Today, the folk paper-cut art of "Snake Coiling Around" and "Snake Coiling Around the Rabbit" is still widely circulated in this region, representing the cultural heritage of the Yellow Emperor's clan with distinct regional characteristics.

"The snake coiling around the rabbit ensures prosperity" is a well-known auspicious saying in northern Shaanxi. The rabbit symbolizes offspring, and the snake coiling around the rabbit is a auspicious symbol of the ancestral totem snake nurturing its descendants. The ancient folk art of the Gaoshan people in Taiwan, "Snake Eggs Giving Birth to Humans," also symbolizes the totem snake nurturing its descendants, which is similar in meaning to the "Snake Coiling Around the Rabbit" in the Yellow River Basin of Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Gansu. It can be said that these are sister pieces of snake totem worship in the folk art of both sides of the Taiwan Strait.

　　民俗“蛇盘兔”
    蛇是中华始组黄帝氏族的图腾，在民族融合发展中，后来演变为龙，成为民族的象征。它的原型是蛇，最早见于山西襄汾陶寺夏墟遗址出土的距今４０００多年前的口衔仙草的彩陶盘图腾盘蛇，可以说它是最早的艺术原型。后来发展演变为商周青铜器上的盘龙。
    黄帝氏族文化发祥地在秦、晋、陇北部黄土高原。今天仍然在这一带广泛流传的民间剪纸“蛇盘盘”和“蛇盘兔”，就是具有地域性文化特征的黄帝氏族文化遗存。
    “蛇盘兔，必定富”，是陕北民间流传的家喻户晓的吉祥谚语。兔喻子孙，蛇盘兔是祖先图腾蛇对子孙的抚育的吉祥象征。我国台湾省蛇图腾崇拜的高山族古老的民间艺术“蛇卵生人”，也是象征图腾蛇对子孙的抚育，与秦、晋、陇黄土高原的“蛇盘兔”内涵相同，可以说是海峡两岸民间艺术中蛇图腾崇拜的姐妹篇。
