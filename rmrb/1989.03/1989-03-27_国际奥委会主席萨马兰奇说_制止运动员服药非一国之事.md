Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, March 23rd.

IOC President Samaranch said that unless governments, sports leaders, and athletes from all countries take concerted action, the Canadian inquiry into drug use in sports will have no effect on ending the use of performance-enhancing drugs by athletes.

Samaranch made these remarks today in an interview with reporters at the IOC headquarters in Lausanne. He said that the inquiry held in Toronto, Canada, is significant as it has exposed some athletes' misuse of banned substances and has drawn public attention to the issue. However, he believes that while the inquiry can reveal details, it cannot solve the problem of athletes using drugs. To stop athletes from using banned substances, it will take the efforts of governments, sports organizations, and the athletes themselves.

Samaranch said that some witnesses have criticized the IOC for not doing enough to combat the misuse of banned substances, which he believes is unfounded. He said that while many talk about banning drugs, few actually do anything about it. The IOC Executive Board, however, approved a plan for random drug testing last December. He believes the success of this plan will depend on the support and assistance of governments around the world.

### 国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇说  制止运动员服药非一国之事

　　国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇说        
    制止运动员服药非一国之事
    新华社日内瓦３月２３日电  国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇说，除非各国政府、体育界领导人和运动员采取一致行动，否则，加拿大调查体育界使用禁药的听证会将不会对结束运动员服用禁药产生任何效果。
    萨马兰奇今天在国际奥委会总部所在地洛桑接受记者采访时说，在加拿大多伦多举行的调查听证会是重要的，它披露了有些运动员滥用禁药的详情，引起公众对使用禁药问题的关注。但是，他认为调查归调查，并不能解决一些运动员使用药物的问题，要制止运动员服违禁药品，就只能靠政府、靠体育组织和运动员自己来解决。
    萨马兰奇说，有些证人批评国际奥委会对反滥用禁药的措施不力是没有根据的。他说，关于禁止服用禁药的事，无论在哪儿都是说得人多、做得人少，而奥委会执委会却在去年１２月通过了一项巡回检验药物的计划。他认为这项计划的成功与否还要靠各国政府的支持和帮助。
