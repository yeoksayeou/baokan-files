The second round of the second Chinese Weiqi Masters Tournament, which was held ahead of schedule, concluded today in Beijing. Ma Xiaochun, a 9th dan player, and Yu Bin, an 8th dan player, defeated Yang Jinhua, a 6th dan player, and Yang Hui, a 7th dan player, respectively, both winning in the middle game. However, Weiqi Saint Nie Weiping lost to Wang Qun, an 8th dan player, by a margin of 3/4 of a point.

Perhaps due to the anticipation of the two upcoming international professional Weiqi tournaments next month, Nie Weiping started the game carelessly today. He lost his advantage early in the middle game when Wang Qun captured more than ten of his pieces, forcing him into a desperate struggle. Seeing an opportunity, Wang Qun played cautiously, calculating each move meticulously and frequently employing clever strategies. However, this approach caused him to exceed the time limit significantly. When the referee began counting down, Nie Weiping still had an hour and a half left. Nie Weiping acted decisively, using evasive maneuvers to create a complex situation on the board, inducing his opponent to make mistakes in the heat of the moment, hoping to turn the game around. This tactic worked, and the difference in territory between the two players quickly narrowed. After the match, Wang Qun repeatedly said, "I didn't expect that a game I was winning so easily almost ended in a loss."

The round-robin tournament to determine the challenger for the title of the previous year's master was originally scheduled to be held in seven rounds starting in July. Considering that several players would be participating in the Fujitsu Cup World Weiqi Championship at the beginning of next month, the organizers decided to advance two of the rounds to serve as warm-up matches for the departing players. In the first round of the competition held before this, Ma Xiaochun defeated Nie Weiping, Yang Jinhua defeated Yang Hui, and Qian Yuping defeated Wang Qun. Cheng Xiaoliu, a 6th dan player who qualified for the round-robin, withdrew from the first two rounds due to illness.

　　第二届中国围棋名人战循环圈赛罢第二轮
    本报北京３月２５日讯  记者缪鲁报道：提前进行的第二届中国围棋名人战循环圈比赛今天在此间又弈一轮。马晓春九段、俞斌八段分别中盘胜杨晋华六段和杨晖七段，棋圣聂卫平却败走麦城，以３／４子之差负于王群八段。
    大概是兴奋点已提前移至下月两次世界职业围棋大赛的缘故，聂卫平今天一开局便大意失荆州，刚进入中盘就被王群吃去十几枚棋子，陷于背水苦战的境地。王群见有机可趁，更步步慎密计算，频频施展妙手。但这一来，他在用时上远远超过对方。当裁判开始给他读秒时，聂卫平的表上还有一个半小时。聂卫平当机立断，运用腾挪手段使盘面呈现错综复杂的形势，诱使对方忙中出错，以求反败为胜。这一招果然奏效，双方的实地差距急剧缩小了。王群在赛后连连说道，没想到，本来大胜的棋竟差点输掉了。
    争夺向上届名人挑战权的循环圈赛，原订于今年７月间分七轮进行。主办者考虑到棋手中有多人将出征下月初的富士通杯世界围棋赛，特将其中两轮对弈提前进行，供出征棋手热身。在此之前的首轮比赛中，马晓春胜聂卫平、杨晋华胜杨晖、钱宇平胜王群。进入循环圈的程晓流六段因病，在前两轮比赛中弃权。
