In the face of the new situation of reform and revitalization, how are the grassroots party organizations in rural areas faring? Recently, during an investigation in the rural areas of Lindian County, Heilongjiang Province, the author found that many grassroots party organizations are not adapting to the new situation.

The leading cadres are not adapting. The main manifestations are: First, outdated ideas. Some people, once they have a little wealth, are content with the status quo and stick to old ways; they lack understanding and depth in recognizing the development of commodity economy; they look down on and dislike those who are flexible and take the lead in revitalizing the economy. Second, low cultural level. Due to a lack of cultural knowledge, some people not only cannot timely impart scientific and technological knowledge but also often misunderstand and misinterpret the policies, directives, and spirit of documents from higher authorities, failing to effectively guide local work and, even more, to lead the masses to enrich themselves scientifically. Third, simple work methods. Some people, facing the new situation, continue to use traditional methods of leading a product economy and collective economy to guide the commodity economy with the household as the operational unit. They do not patiently and meticulously explain and propagate to the masses the decisions of higher authorities, nor do they patiently and meticulously do ideological work among the masses. Often, it is a one-man show, a one-size-fits-all approach, and a short-lived campaign, causing the masses to distrust and oppose the organization. Fourth, declining work enthusiasm. Some do not think, do not take on responsibilities, and do not work; some only care about immediate gains, fear hardships, and lack long-term planning.

The party member ranks are not adapting. The prominent manifestations are: First, narrow social concepts and the idea of being content with a little wealth, standing at the door and watching over the "responsibility field." Second, level not adapting. In some townships and villages, more than 90% of party members have only junior high school, elementary school, or no education. Most party members lack the scientific and cultural knowledge and management skills necessary for developing commodity production, making it difficult for them to get rich. The masses say they cannot read newspapers, speak incoherently, and lack the drive to develop a commodity economy. Third, age not adapting. The aging problem is becoming increasingly serious.

The organizational setup is not adapting. The setup of party grassroots organizations has not been adjusted in a timely manner according to the changes in economic organizations, still maintaining the old framework of setting party branches in production brigades and party small groups in production teams during the collective era. This does not adapt to the new economic pattern and new operational methods, causing the party's organizational system to be out of sync with the economic organizational system, unable to effectively lead, supervise, and guarantee economic work. Due to the failure to break the old setup, some newly emerged economic cooperatives, individual enterprises, and collective enterprises do not have party organizations.

The mode of activity is not adapting. At present, a considerable number of village party branches still use the old methods and content of activities. Party organizational life is monotonous and rigid, failing to organically combine with the development of productive forces and commodity economy, and also failing to organically combine with ideological construction, organizational construction, and spiritual civilization construction. To varying degrees, there is a phenomenon of party organizational activities being detached from political and economic system reforms.

To solve the problems existing in the construction of rural party grassroots organizations, there are many tasks to be done, but the main focus should be on the following:

First, select talents without being bound by conventional standards. In the selection criteria, the focus should shift from the past emphasis on political standards to combining political standards with productive force standards, without compromising.

Second, adjust the organizational setup according to the new situation brought about by the changes in production and operation methods, and strengthen the management of party members. ① For those villages with a large population, many party members (about 50), and scattered residences, a general branch should be established in the village, and a branch in the hamlet. ② For those villages where the secondary and tertiary industries are relatively developed, party branches should be established according to professional divisions. ③ For economic cooperatives and individual enterprises with more than three party members, separate party branches should be established. ④ For collective party members working and doing business outside, temporary party branches or small groups should be established if possible.

Third, enrich the content of organizational activities according to the new tasks proposed by the deepening of economic and political system reforms. The main focus should be on learning the basic knowledge of the party, increasing the learning of commodity economy knowledge, scientific and technological knowledge, and exchanging experiences of getting rich, so that party members gradually become proficient in management, hardworking, and scientifically enriched.

### 农村基层党组织建设报忧——黑龙江省林甸县调查

　　农村基层党组织建设报忧
    ——黑龙江省林甸县调查
    在改革、搞活的新形势面前，农村党的基层组织建设情况怎样？最近，笔者在黑龙江省林甸县农村调查时发现，相当多的基层党组织存在不适应新形势的情况。
    领导班子不适应。主要表现：一是思想观念陈旧。有些人稍富即安，满足现状，墨守成规；对发展商品经济认识不足，理解不深；对那些头脑灵活、带头搞活经济的人看不上、看不惯。二是文化素质偏低。有些人由于缺少文化知识，有的不但不能及时地传授科学技术，而且往往对上级的方针、政策和文件精神理解偏了，宣传错了，不能很好地指导当地的工作，更谈不上带领群众科学致富。三是工作方法简单。有些人面对新形势，继续沿用领导传统的产品经济、集体经济的工作方法，去指导以家庭为经营单位的商品经济。对上级决定，既不向群众做耐心细致的宣传解释，又不向群众做耐心细致的思想工作，往往是一言堂、一刀切、一阵风，造成群众对组织的不信任和对立情绪。四是工作劲头减退。有的不想事、不摊事、不干事；有的顾眼前，现得利，怕碰硬，缺少长远打算。
    党员队伍不适应。突出的表现是站在屋门前，盯住“责任田”的狭隘社会观念和小富即安观念。二是水平不适应。一些乡村的党员，初中、小学文化程度和文盲的占９０％以上。多数党员缺少发展商品生产所必需的科学文化知识和经营管理知识，致富无门。群众说他们是看报不识字，讲话不成句，发展商品经济没有劲。三是年龄不适应。老化的问题日渐严重。
    组织设置不适应。党的基层组织设置没有根据经济组织的变化及时地进行调整，仍然是大帮哄时以大队设党支部、生产队设党小组的旧框架，不适应新的经济格局和新的经营方式需要，造成党的组织建制与经济组织建制不协调，对经济工作不能有效地起到领导、监督、保证作用。由于旧的设置形式没打破，使一些新出现的经济联合体、个体企业、集体企业没有党的组织。
    活动方式不适应。目前仍有相当一部分村党支部的活动方式、活动内容还是过去的老一套。党的组织生活单调、刻板，没能与发展生产力和商品经济有机结合起来，也没能与思想建设、组织建设以及精神文明建设有机地结合起来，程度不同地存在着党的组织活动与政治、经济体制改革两层皮的现象。
    解决农村党的基层组织建设中存在的问题，有许多工作要做，但主要应抓好如下几项：
    要不拘一格选拔人才。在选人标准上，要从过去那种偏重于政治标准的倾向转变到把政治标准和生产力标准结合起来，不凑合。
    要根据生产经营方式变革带来的新情况，调整组织设置，加强党员管理。①对那些村型大，党员多（５０名左右），居住分散的支部，应在村上建总支，屯里建支部。②对那些二三产业比较发达的村，应按专业分工建立行业党支部。③对有３名以上党员的经济联合体和个体企业，应单独建立党支部。④对集体外出务工经商的党员，能建立临时党支部、党小组的，也应成立临时支部或小组。　
    要根据深化经济、政治体制改革提出的新任务，充实组织活动内容。主要是在学好党的基本知识的基础上，增加学习商品经济知识、科学技术知识和交流发家致富经验等内容，使党员逐步做到懂经营、会管理，勤劳致富，科学致富。
