The 18th Session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference concluded after discussing key political, economic, and cultural issues facing the Islamic world, as well as the Palestinian cause.

In the closing plenary session, the delegates, in accordance with the agenda of this conference, adopted more than 50 resolutions on issues including Palestine, the Middle East peace process, the Iran-Iraq peace, the Lebanese crisis, and the situation in Afghanistan.

In the resolution on the Iran-Iraq peace issue, the conference urged Iran and Iraq to fully implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 598, and to resolve their conflicts through peaceful negotiations in a just, lasting, and comprehensive manner.

The conference's development strategy resolution called on all member states to resume international economic negotiations under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations, and to make greater efforts to strengthen economic cooperation among member states.

The conference hailed the struggle of the Namibian people for independence and hoped they would strengthen their unity with the South West Africa People's Organization. The conference also strongly condemned the South African government's brutal suppression of blacks and its policy of invading neighboring countries.

Beijing, March 17 (Xinhua) — According to local newspapers and foreign news agencies, the 18th Session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, held in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh, adopted a resolution at yesterday's closing ceremony recognizing the legitimate seat of the Afghan seven-party alliance provisional government in the organization.

Since the Soviet armed invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the seat of Afghanistan in the Organization of the Islamic Conference has been vacant. After the formation of the seven-party alliance provisional government, its foreign minister, Gulbuddin, led a delegation to Riyadh to lobby successfully. This is the first international organization to recognize the Afghan seven-party alliance provisional government.

Riyadh, March 16 (Xinhua) — The 18th Session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference today adopted a resolution at its closing session recognizing the State of Palestine and hoping that the United Nations would administer the occupied territories and supervise the final withdrawal of Israel.

	March 16, 1989, the 18th Session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Organization of the Islamic Conference concluded in the Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh. The conference reached resolutions on more than 50 issues, including the Middle East peace process and the Iran-Iraq war.
