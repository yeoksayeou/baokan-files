Strengthening Anti-Corruption Efforts to Curb Corruption
— An Interview with Chen Zuolin, Deputy Secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission

Reporter: During the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, many representatives discussed issues of corruption within the Party and anti-corruption efforts. What are your thoughts on this?

Chen Zuolin: I believe that during this period of great social change in our country, as reforms deepen and the old and new systems transition, there are indeed some Party members and cadres who take advantage of the situation to engage in embezzlement, extortion, and abuse of power. These behaviors have become serious issues hindering reform and modernization. First, we should not be overly alarmed by these phenomena; they are the dross that appears during periods of great social change, not a sign of the decay of our social system. Second, we must not be complacent; we must fully exercise our initiative, strengthen anti-corruption efforts, and seriously address these issues.

The difference between tackling and not tackling corruption is significant.

Reporter: Controlling corruption is easier said than done. What are some effective measures being implemented in various regions?

Chen Zuolin: There is no secret or magic formula. The key is leadership commitment and personal involvement in seriously addressing anti-corruption work, truly placing it on the agenda. Many places, such as Beijing's Dongcheng District, Shanghai's Huangpu District, Yantai in Shandong, and Zhaodong in Heilongjiang, have proven this. The Xingtai region in Hebei has not just talked about anti-corruption; it has started from the leadership and from the top down, addressing the most pressing issues that concern the public. They have achieved results by tackling corruption from the top down and from the bottom up. The problem of corrupt governance is not an incurable disease, but it requires real effort, genuine action, and concrete measures. Similarly, places and units where anti-corruption work is not done well, or where passive corruption is prevalent, often have leaders who are bureaucratic and out of touch with reality, or who are afraid to take action; some leaders, driven by local or small group interests, turn a blind eye to corruption, or even protect and support it; in extreme cases, it is the leaders themselves who are involved, or even collective decisions. Many facts show that tackling corruption or not makes a big difference.

We must rely on the system to ensure results.

Reporter: Some places focus on anti-corruption work but only pay lip service, resulting in mere formalities. How can this problem be solved?

Chen Zuolin: Anti-corruption work must be thorough, and institutional building must keep up, becoming standardized and scientific. For example, many places have implemented the "two publicizations and one supervision" method, making procedures and results public, increasing transparency, and placing Party and government organs, Party and government officials, and law enforcement and public service departments under the supervision of both Party members and the general public. This way, corrupt behavior has no place to hide. No one dares to act recklessly, otherwise they will face deserved punishment. This external supervision is simple and effective, especially suitable for departments that have extensive contact with the public, and is a good remedy for solving problems that directly harm the interests of the people. Recently, during my investigation in Hebei, I learned that Baoding City is summarizing experiences in establishing internal restraint mechanisms and standardizing power behavior. They have improved the management of Party and government organs and some economic function departments, strengthened the "internal restraint mechanism," and placed the exercise of various powers under the regulation and constraint of laws and regulations, effectively curbing the commodification of power. The characteristic of the "internal restraint mechanism" is to focus on internal aspects, power decomposition, management crossover, cadre rotation, and responsibility-based power, solving problems that the public finds difficult to supervise, or where interests are closely related and mutual benefit is strong. For behaviors that harm national and collective interests for personal gain, or harm overall interests for the benefit of units and departments, it is a powerful restraint. Whether it is external supervision or internal restraint, both have their unique effects and can effectively prevent corruption such as using power for personal gain, using public resources for private benefit, and power-money exchanges. They are all institutional guarantees for the clean governance of Party and government officials. However, no matter which measure is taken, it has its advantages and disadvantages. Only by complementing and coordinating them, and comprehensively managing them, can corruption be limited to the smallest range and lowest level.

Efforts must be made to ensure implementation.

Reporter: The public has a saying, "No police under the traffic light," meaning that in some places, anti-corruption efforts, although having institutions, do not function effectively. Institutions are established but no one supervises, and violations are not investigated. What are your thoughts on this?

Chen Zuolin: From the experiences of various places, to ensure that anti-corruption work is effective, a strict anti-corruption responsibility system must be established, with each level responsible to the next, and each level ensuring implementation. It should be considered an important part of evaluating officials' performance. At the same time, designated departments and relevant units should conduct regular inspections and necessary spot checks, promptly addressing any issues found. For those who do not take anti-corruption work seriously or implement it superficially, criticism and education should be conducted; for those who are derelict in their duties, in addition to economic penalties, party and administrative disciplinary actions should be taken. This way, right and wrong are clear, responsibilities are clear, and rewards and punishments are clear, and anti-corruption work will be effectively implemented.

Reporter: How do you assess the current situation of anti-corruption work?

Chen Zuolin: Overall, the situation is good, and there are many favorable conditions for strengthening anti-corruption work: First, the Party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to anti-corruption work, issuing multiple documents and instructions, and various levels of Party committees and discipline inspection commissions are seriously implementing them, achieving initial results; second, the in-depth implementation of rectification and adjustment of reforms has created a good environment and conditions for strengthening anti-corruption work; third, various regions and departments have summarized, accumulated, and created some new experiences, and many places have formed a small anti-corruption atmosphere, which is expanding. Therefore, our Party and government have the ability, relying on their own strength, self-purification function, and the supervision and support of the broad masses, to use healthy forces to suppress and eliminate the unhealthy practices and corruption within the ranks.

　　加强廉政建设　遏制腐败现象        
    ——访中纪委副书记陈作霖
    本报记者  陈维伟
    记者：七届人大二次会议上，许多代表谈到党内腐败现象和廉政建设问题，您对此有何看法？
    陈作霖：我认为，在我国社会大变革时期，随着改革的逐步深入和新旧体制的交替，确有少数党员干部乘隙贪污受贿、弄权勒索、徇私枉法，这些行为已经成为阻碍改革和现代化建设的严重问题。对这些腐败现象，一不能大惊小怪，这是社会大变革过程中出现的渣滓，而不是我们社会制度衰败的表现。二是不能掉以轻心，必须最大限度地发挥主观能动性，加强廉政建设，认真加以解决。
    　　　　抓和不抓大不一样
    记者：遏制腐败现象，说来容易做来难，目前各地有哪些“锦囊妙计”呢？
    陈作霖：其实，这并没有什么奥妙和绝招，关键在于领导重视决心大，亲自动手认真抓，真正把廉政工作摆到议事日程上。北京东城区、上海黄浦区、山东的烟台、黑龙江省的肇东市等许多地方的事实，已经充分说明了这一点。河北邢台地区抓廉政不是停留在口头上，也不满足于一般号召，而是从领导机关、领导干部做起，从自己做起，从群众最关心、意见最大的“热点”和“难点”抓起，从上往下抓，上下一起抓，抓出了成效。可见，为政不廉的问题并不是什么“顽症”，但医治起来，一定要花大力气，动真格的，来实在的。同样，廉政工作抓得不够好，或者消极腐败现象比较严重的地方和单位，有的是领导官僚主义，不了解真实情况，以其昏昏，使人昭昭；有的领导虽然了解情况，但“怕”字当头，睁只眼，闭只眼，不敢抓不敢管；有的领导从局部和小团体利益出发，对腐败现象听之任之，甚至庇护和支持；有的是领导带头干的，极个别的甚至是集体研究决定的。许多事实说明，抓与不抓，效果大不一样。
    　　　　要靠制度做保证
    记者：有些地方抓廉政工作，喜欢摆花架子，流于形式，这个问题应当如何解决？
    陈作霖：廉政工作要深入，制度建设要跟上，并使之规范化、科学化。比如，许多地方先后实行了“两公开一监督”的办法，把办事制度、办事结果公开，加大了透明度，把党政机关、党政干部和执法、公用事业部门置于党内外群众的监督之下，不廉洁的行为就失去了藏身之地。谁也不敢乱来、胡来，否则就难以逃脱应得的惩处。这种外部监督简便易行，事半功倍，特别适合于那些和群众有广泛接触的部门，对解决那些直接侵害群众利益的问题是一剂良药。最近，我在河北调查时了解到，保定市正在总结建立内部制约机制，规范权力行为的经验。他们通过改善党政机关和一些经济职能部门的管理制度，强化“内约机制”，把各种权力的行使都置于法规、制度的规范和约束之下，有效地遏制了权力的商品化。“内约机制”的特点是从内部着眼，进行权力分解、管理交叉、干部换岗和以责制权，解决那些群众不便监督，或利害相关、互惠性很强的问题。对损害国家和集体利益以肥个人、损害全局利益以利单位和部门的行为，是一种强有力的制约。无论是外部监督还是内部制约，都有其独特的功效，都能有效地防止以权谋私、假公济私和权钱交易的腐败现象，都是从制度上保证党政干部的廉洁自律。但不管哪种措施都有其长处和短处，只有相互补充，协调配套，综合治理，才能把腐败现象限制在最小的范围和最低的程度。
    　　　　功夫下在落实上
    记者：群众有句话，叫做“红绿灯下无警察”，是说有的地方搞廉政虽然也有制度，但发挥不了什么效能，定了制度无人监督，违反制度无人查处，您对此有何见解？
    陈作霖：从各地的经验来看，要把廉政工作落到实处，必须建立严格的廉政责任制，一级对一级负责，层层抓落实，并把它作为考核干部政绩的一项重要内容。同时，指定主管部门和有关单位进行定期检查和必要的抽查，发现问题及时进行处理。对抓而不紧，抓而不实的，要进行批评教育；对失职渎职的，除给以经济处罚外，还要给予党纪政纪处分。这样做，是非分明、责任分明、奖惩分明，廉政工作也就落到了实处。
    记者：您对当前廉政工作形势如何估价？
    陈作霖：从总体上讲，形势不错，抓好廉政工作有许多有利条件：一是党中央、国务院对廉政工作十分重视，多次发出文件和指示，各级党委、纪委都在认真贯彻落实，并已取得初步成效；二是治理整顿和调整改革的深入开展，已经为搞好廉政工作创造了良好的环境和条件；三是各地区、各部门总结、积累和创造了一些新鲜经验，许多地方已经形成廉政的“小气候”，并且覆盖面越来越大。所以，我们的党和政府完全有能力依靠自身的力量，依靠自我净化的功能，依靠广大群众的监督和支持，能够用健康的力量来抑制和清除队伍中存在的某些不正之风和腐败现象。
