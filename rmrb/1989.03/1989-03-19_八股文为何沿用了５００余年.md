The Eight-Legged Essay is often met with deep disgust and criticism for hindering the development of Chinese culture and academia. However, what were the initial reasons for establishing the examination system that used the Eight-Legged Essay for selecting officials? How did it manage to persist for over 500 years? The second issue of 1989 of *Wenshi Zhishi* published an article by Liu Haifeng stating that the Eight-Legged Essay had its necessary conditions for emergence and internal reasons for its prolonged use. The specific functions of the Eight-Legged Essay in the imperial examinations during the Ming and Qing dynasties can be analyzed from both content and form.

In terms of content:

First, it controlled people's thoughts, making examinees read only the Confucian classics to strengthen feudal rule. The topics for the Eight-Legged Essay were all taken from the existing phrases in the *Four Books* and *Five Classics*, and the writing had to be in the style of "speaking on behalf of the sages," meaning writing in the voice of the sages.

Second, it defined the scope of preparation. The Eight-Legged Essay stipulated that the interpretation of the content of the *Four Books* and *Five Classics* must follow the commentary of the Cheng-Zhu school.

In terms of form, the Eight-Legged Essay had three functions:

First, it prevented cheating. The structure and format of the Eight-Legged Essay had specific restrictions, consisting of parts such as the introduction, continuation, opening remarks, entry, first section, middle section, last section, and conclusion. It was necessary to write strictly according to the format, making the answers not random and reducing the possibility of cheating, but it also became rigid and stereotyped, leading to a dead end.

Second, it standardized and objectified the evaluation criteria and reduced the workload of evaluating papers. The Ming Dynasty stipulated that for the provincial and metropolitan examinations, one essay on the *Five Classics* was limited to 500 characters, and one essay on the *Four Books* was limited to 300 characters. During the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, 550 characters were required, and after the Qianlong reign, it was uniformly set to 700 characters; otherwise, the paper would be invalid. This standardized essay format made the evaluation objective and reduced the workload of evaluating papers, while also facilitating the calculation of the evaluation workload.

Third, to a certain extent, it could test the examinees' basic writing skills. To write a thematic essay in the format of the Eight-Legged Essay, a basic level of language proficiency was required. The Eight-Legged Essay emphasized style and tone, blending the structure of prose, the parallelism of *pianwen*, and the meter of *jintishi* to form a new literary genre.

### 八股文为何沿用了５００余年

　　八股文为何沿用了５００余年
    一提起“八股文”，许多人便深恶痛绝，指责其阻碍了中国文化学术的发展。但最初人们是根据什么来制定以八股文取士的考试制度的呢？它又怎么能延续了５００多年呢？１９８９年第２期《文史知识》刊登刘海峰的文章说，八股文在当时有其产生的必然性，也有其得以沿用的内在原因。八股文在明清科举考试中的特定功用，可以从内容和形式两方面来分析。
    就内容而言：第一，可以控制人们的思想，使考生只读儒家经典，以强化封建统治。八股文题目一律用《四书》、《五经》中的现成话，写作必须“代圣人立言”，即用圣人口气行文。第二，划定备考范围。八股文规定《四书》、《五经》内容诠释必须以程朱学派的注解为准。
    从形式上看，八股文有３种功能：第一，防止作弊。八股文结构体裁有特定的限制，全文由破题、承题、起讲、入手、起股、中股、后股、束股等部分组成。必须严格按照格式作文，使答题不致漫无程式，减少了作弊的可能，但却变得僵化刻板，走向死胡同。第二，使评卷标准化、客观化，并减省评卷工作量。明代规定，乡试、会试《五经》义一道，限５００字；《四书》义一道，限３００字。清康熙年间要求５５０字，乾隆以后一律以７００字为准，否则试卷作废。这种标准化的作文试卷使评阅客观，也减省评卷工作量，同时也便于计算评卷工作量。第三，在一定程度上，可以测验出考生的文字基本功。要按八股文的格式，作好命题作文，没有起码的语文水平是不行的。八股文注重款式与格调，是糅合了散文的章法、骈文的排偶和近体诗的格律而构成的一种新文体。
