Our country's arable land resources are limited and cannot meet the needs of people's lives and economic construction. What is the way forward for agriculture? Shi Shan proposes:

Breaking out of the cultivated land circle – developing mountainous regions

Potential: Mountainous regions account for 70% of the country's land, with abundant resources. Currently, there are 20 to 30 billion mu of forestry land that have not been well utilized, and there are 10 billion mu of grassy mountains in the south that can be transformed.

Currently, people are thinking, discussing, and exploring the severe situation and the way forward for China's agriculture. I believe that to push China's agriculture to a new stage and achieve sustainable development, we must break out of the small circle of cultivated land, open up new production areas, and especially focus on managing mountainous regions.

Cultivated land is indeed important and still has potential. The clothing and food needs of the Chinese people, as well as most of the raw materials for the light textile and food industries, mainly rely on cultivated land for supply. At any time, this cannot be neglected. However, China's arable land resources are very limited. Relying solely on cultivated land is difficult to meet the needs of people's lives and economic construction, and farmers cannot get rich. What is the way forward? Now it should be clearly pointed out: The potential lies in the mountainous regions, and the hope lies in the mountainous regions. This is because:

First, China is a mountainous country, with mountainous regions (including hilly areas) accounting for 70% of the national territory. There are 1,481 counties with mountains as the main feature, accounting for more than 60% of the total number of counties and cities, and the population accounts for about 40% of the total population.

Second, mountainous regions are strategically important, both as production bases and for the security of the plains. They not only serve as production bases for various products, directly supporting the livelihoods of the mountain people, but also provide water resources, bamboo and wood resources, and other resources for the plains. At the same time, they ensure the safety of the plains. If the mountainous regions continue to be damaged, the plains will face further threats from floods, landslides, river and reservoir siltation, and other disasters.

Third, the economic benefits of managing mountainous regions are excellent. China's mountainous regions are rich in resources, especially the vast southern mountainous regions, known as a treasure trove of the world. They have abundant rainfall, a warm climate, and a coincidence of rain and heat, with a variety of animals and plants. Currently, many bamboo, tea, fruits, dried fruits, medicinal materials, local specialties, and some industrial raw materials are provided by mountainous regions. If managed properly, both the variety and quantity can be significantly increased.

How much potential do mountainous regions have? Look at the following statistics: China's forestry land is 40 billion mu, of which barren land, sparse forest land, shrub land, and unformed afforestation land account for more than 50%. Among the forested land, there are also many gaps. In other words, about 25 to 30 billion mu of forestry land have not been well utilized. These are the barren hills, slopes, and remnants of forests seen everywhere in the mountains, with light and heat resources being wasted. In addition, there are nearly 10 billion mu of grassy mountains in the southern mountainous regions that can be transformed and utilized.

Can we solve the severe problems facing agriculture by staying within the circle of cultivated land? What consequences will ignoring the development and management of mountainous regions bring? Look at the following figures:

The area of soil erosion in the Yangtze River Basin has now increased by about onefold compared to the early days of liberation, from 20% of the total area to about 40%;

The range and degree of harm caused by landslides have also increased by about onefold in the same period, directly threatening 200 county seats, 17 railways, numerous mountainous roads, as well as factories, mines, farmland, and villages;

The number of collective forest areas in the south providing timber has now decreased by 42% compared to the early days of liberation, i.e., 118 counties;

All 18 poverty-stricken regions in the country are in mountainous regions, and most of them are in the southern mountainous regions, with the number of counties accounting for 75% of the poverty-stricken counties.

If the mountainous regions continue to be damaged and the ecological environment further deteriorates, it will not only affect agricultural production but also the entire nation's living and development conditions. In this sense, developing and managing mountainous regions is a fundamental strategy and cannot be delayed.

What are the benefits and prospects of developing and utilizing mountainous land? Since 1985, five mountainous counties in Hangzhou City have taken the development of low hills and gentle slopes as the breakthrough point for agricultural development, concentrating efforts on the large-scale management of economic forests on gentle slopes. Tea, sericulture, edible bamboo shoots, fresh fruits, dried fruits, medicinal materials, and other products have gradually developed. Not only has arable land been freed up for grain production, but a considerable amount of woody grains and oils can also be produced.

In China, there are many mountainous regions similar to the mountainous counties in Hangzhou City. Unfortunately, there are still many people who do not pay attention to mountains and have not broken out of the circle of cultivated land in their thinking.

　　我国耕地资源有限，难以满足人民生活和经济建设的需要。农业的出路何在？石山提出：
    跳出耕地的圈子——开发山区
    潜力：山区占国土百分之七十，资源富饶，目前林业用地有二三十亿未很好利用，南方有十亿亩草山可改造
    目前，人们都在思考、议论、探讨我国农业面临的严峻形势和出路问题。我认为，要把我国农业推进到一个新的阶段和实现持久发展，就要跳出耕地的小圈子，开辟新的生产领域，特别要认真经营山区。
    耕地固然重要，也还有潜力。我国人民的衣食所需，轻纺、食品工业的大部分原料，主要依靠耕地供应，任何时候也不能忽视。但是，我国的耕地资源十分有限，仅仅靠耕地难以满足人民生活和经济建设的需要，农民也富不起来。出路何在？现在应该明确指出：潜力在山区，希望在山区。这是因为：
    第一，我国是个多山的国家，山区（包括丘陵区）占国土的７０％，以山区为主的县１４８１个，超过总县市数的６０％，人口约占总人口数的４０％。
    第二，山区居高临下，既是生产基地，又关系平原安危。它不仅本身就是多种产品的生产基地，直接养育着山区人民，还为平原提供水资源、竹木资源和其他多种资源，同时保障着平原。如果山区继续遭受破坏，平原将进一步受到山洪暴发、泥石流为害、河库淤积等威胁。
    第三，经营山区的经济效益极佳。我国山区的资源是富饶的，特别是广大南方山区被称为全世界的一块宝地，雨量充沛、气候温暖，而且雨热同期，动植物种类繁多，目前许多竹木、茶叶、水果、干果、药材、土特产品以及一些工业原料都是山区提供的。如果认真经营起来，品种和数量都能大幅度地增加。
    山区潜力有多大？且看以下统计数字：我国林业用地４０亿亩，其中无林地、疏林地、灌木林和未成林造林地占５０％以上，有林地中空隙地也很多。也就是说，林业用地中约有２５—３０亿亩没有很好利用起来，这就是在山区到处可见的荒山、荒坡和残林迹地，光热资源长期白白浪费着。此外，南方山区还有近１０亿亩的草山可以改造利用。
    在耕地的圈子里打转转，能否解决农业面临的严峻问题？忽视山区的开发和治理，会带来什么后果？请看下列数字：
    长江流域的水土流失面积，现在比解放初期增加了一倍左右，由占总面积的２０％上升到４０％左右；
    泥石流的活动范围和危害程度，同期内也增加了一倍左右，直接威胁着２００个县城、１７条铁路、山区大量公路以及厂矿、农田和村庄；
    南方集体林区提供木材的县，现在比解放初期减少了４２％，即１１８个县；
    全国１８片贫困地区都在山区，而且大部分在南方山区，所属县数占到贫困县的７５％。
    如果山区继续遭到破坏，生态环境进一步恶化，受影响的不仅是农业生产，而是我们整个民族的生存发展条件。从这个意义上说，开发和治理山区是治本之策，而且刻不容缓。
    开发、利用山地的效益和前景究竟怎样？杭州市５个山区县１９８５年以来，把经营低丘缓坡作为发展农业的突破口，集中力量在缓坡成片经营经济林木，茶叶、蚕桑、食用竹笋、鲜果、干果、药材等已逐步发展起来，不仅腾出耕地搞粮食，还能生产相当数量的木本粮油。
    在我国，有杭州市山区县类似条件的山区，可谓比比皆是。可惜，还有不少人目中无山，思路上没有跳出耕地的圈子。
