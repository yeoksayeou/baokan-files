A patch of blue sky, a rare patch of blue sky. A clean and tidy room, a rare clean and tidy room.

I walked through history, covering 1,700 years in a single day.

In the western district, at the Fengshu Mountain and Panlong Ridge, I saw ancient kilns with porcelain made through "water-powered pounding, wheel-thrown shaping, sun-drying, and pine-fired kilns." Beside the kilns were stacks of pine firewood, each piece about eight inches square. An old craftsman told me: the porcelain blanks need to be fired at 1,300 degrees Celsius to become porcelain, and firing one kiln of porcelain requires several kilns of firewood. At that time, the ancient kilns were densely packed in the Huatian area, where "the north uses Changjiang water, the south uses Nan Mountain pine, and the center uses Yitao clay." Every village had pottery, every place had kilns, and the sound of hammers echoed everywhere, with flames lighting up the sky. When the pine trees on Nan Mountain were depleted, they extended inward, from Fuliang, Fuchun, Gaoshan, to Tunxi and Qimen in Anhui, stretching for hundreds of miles. Along the highways and main roads, stacks of eight-inch square pine firewood were piled up, providing energy for the ancient kiln groups in Jingdezhen. In 1712, a French missionary wrote in a letter to his church: "At night, Jingdezhen seems to be a city surrounded by fireworks, like a large stove with many chimneys." Imagine this city of fire, this large stove, how many trees it burns in a year, how many forests it destroys!

Replacing wood with coal should be a historical progress. I came out of the ancient kilns and arrived at Weimin Porcelain Factory, known as the "mother of Jingdezhen porcelain." This is a factory built in 1958 with state investment after public-private cooperation, producing 30 million pieces of porcelain per day using coal and heavy oil as energy sources. In the 200,000-square-meter factory area, there is not a single piece of pine firewood, only several chimneys towering tens of meters high, pointing towards the sky. The chimneys burning coal emit rolling black smoke, while those burning heavy oil emit a sky full of gray haze. If you stand at a high point and look down, this city of only a few square kilometers is densely covered with 623 chimneys, known as the "600 black dragons in the porcelain capital." These 623 black dragons, day and night, emit how much black smoke and poisonous mist, I do not know. I only know that this city, which is a brilliant gem in the history of Chinese ceramics, can hardly see white clouds or blue sky. The sky is heavy, the earth is dim, and people are suffocating. Walking on the streets, there is sand in the eyes, and people look blurry.

Jingdezhen, along with Anshan, Benxi, and Maanshan, is known as one of the four major air pollution areas in the country. Someone once said that the sparrows in Anshan are all black, and the leaves in Jingdezhen are not green. These might be exaggerations. What I saw with my own eyes is that the French plane trees used for street greening often have a layer of black ash on their leaves, which is true. Just-polished shoes get covered with a layer of dust as soon as they hit the street, which is true. After walking around the city, you can dig out a fingerful of black ash from your nostrils, which is true. Except for a small area of Lianhua Pond, it is not safe to take a deep breath in other places.

Suffocation, unbearable suffocation! When I walked out of the suffocation, I came to Huafeng Porcelain Factory, ten miles away from the city center, and finally felt relieved, taking a deep breath. My eyes cleared, my ears became sharp, the tea table was clean, and the windows let in bright light. I saw the sun, the white clouds, and the blue sky. In this porcelain capital shrouded in gloom, this patch of blue sky is so rare.

Huafeng is in its prime. It specializes in the production of export blue-and-white porcelain. In less than three years of operation, the average age of the workers is only 24. It does not burn wood, coal, or heavy oil, but only coal gas. This factory, which uses coal gas as an energy source (the fourth generation of energy in Jingdezhen), is the first of its kind in China and one of the best in the Far East.

From wood, coal, heavy oil to coal gas, the old man of history has walked 1,700 years with slow and heavy steps. How many miracles were created, and how many sacrifices were made. In the era of using pine wood as an energy source, it was at the cost of destroying hundreds of miles of primitive forests; in the era of using coal and oil as energy sources, it was at the cost of damaging the ecological environment, harming people's health, and shortening people's lives. Only in the Huafeng era of using coal gas as an energy source, people gain both treasures and health through the art of fire. This brilliant gem can wipe off the dust on its body and shine with radiant light.

Currently, Huafeng is the only one of its kind, and the blue sky is only this one patch. The people of the porcelain capital told me that the Jiazhuo Coal Gas Factory, a key provincial project, has been under construction for five years and will soon supply energy coal gas to various porcelain factories in the city. In a few years, the haze will be completely dispersed, and the sky above the porcelain capital of the motherland will surely be vast and boundless blue.

Ah, the blue sky of the porcelain capital, the blue sky that people yearn for!

### 瓷都的蓝天

　　瓷都的蓝天
    程关森
    一片蓝天，难得的一片蓝天。窗明几净，难得的窗明几净。
    我从历史走来，一天走了１７００年。
    在西市区的枫树山盘龙岗，我看到了“水碓粉碎，辘轳成型，太阳晒干，松柴烧窑”的古窑瓷。窑边堆的全是八寸见方的松木劈柴。老艺人告诉我：瓷胚要经过１３００度的高温才能成瓷，烧一窑瓷得要费几窑的柴。那时古窑密集在“北吃昌江水，南吃南山松，中吃宜陶土”的湖田一带，村村陶埏，处处窑火，万杵声响，火光烛天。南山松烧光了，便向里伸延，从浮梁、赋春、高砂，一直到安徽的屯溪、祁门，绵亘数百里，公路上大道旁，堆的都是为景德镇古窑群提供能源的八寸见方的松木劈柴。１７１２年，法国一位传教士在给教会的信上这样写道：“到了夜晚，景德镇好像是被焰火包围的一座火城，又像一座有许多烟囱的大火炉。”试想想，这座火城，这座大火炉，一年要烧多少树，要毁多少林！
    以煤代柴，应该是一个历史性进步。我从古窑出来，到达号称“景瓷之母”的为民瓷厂。这是１９５８年公私合营后国家投资兴建的以煤和重油为能源的日产瓷３０００万件的大厂。在２０万平方米的厂区，见不到一块松柴，只有几根高达数十米的烟囱直指苍天。烧煤的烟囱黑烟滚滚，烧重油的烟囱灰雾漫天。如果站在制高点眺望，这个只有几平方公里的市区竟密布着６２３个烟囱，号称６００条乌龙乱瓷都。这６２３条乌龙，一天到晚要吐出多少黑烟喷出多少毒雾我不知道，我只知道，这个在我国陶瓷史上堪称一颗灿烂明珠的瓷都，成天看不到白云，看不到蓝天。天是沉重的，地是灰黯的，人是窒息的。走在街上眼里有沙，看人也是模模糊糊的呢。
    景德镇和鞍山、本溪、马鞍山被称为全国四大大气污染区。有人说过，鞍山的麻雀全是黑的，景德镇的树叶没有绿的。这都可能有些夸大。我亲眼见到的，作为街道绿化树的法国梧桐叶面上常积一层黑灰是真的，刚擦得锃亮的皮鞋一上街就糊上一层尘土是真的，到市区转过一圈回来鼻孔里能抠出一指头黑灰是真的，除莲花塘一隅净土外，其他地方不敢张开肺叶作深呼吸也是真的。
    窒息，窒息，难忍难堪的窒息！当我从窒息中走出，来到距市区十里的华风瓷厂，我才算得到了解脱，深深舒了一口气。眼明了，耳聪了，茶几是洁净的，窗户里透进了明媚的光。我看到了太阳，看到了白云，看到了蓝天。在阴霾笼罩的瓷都，这是多么难得的一片蓝天呵。
    华风正风华正茂。它专门生产出口青花瓷。投产不到三年，工人平均年龄只有２４岁。它不烧柴，不烧煤，不烧重油，只烧煤气，而以煤气作能源的（这在景德镇是第四代能源）瓷厂，在我国还是第一家，在远东也是第一流的。
    从柴、煤、重油到煤气，历史老人用缓慢而沉重的步履走过了１７００年。其中创造了多少奇迹，又作出了多少牺牲。在用松柴作能源的年代，是以毁灭绵亘数百里的原始森林作代价的；在以煤、油作能源的年代，是以破坏生态环境、损害人的健康、缩短人的寿命为代价的。只有到了以煤气为能源的华风时代，人们通过火的艺术既获得瑰宝又获得健康，这颗璀璨明珠才能拭除身上的灰尘而显出光华四射的光彩。
    目前，华风仅此一家，蓝天仅此一片。瓷都人告诉我，作为省重点工程的焦作煤气厂已兴建了五年，不久就可向全市各家瓷厂输送能源煤气了。要不了几年，阴霾将会全部驱散，祖国瓷都的上空必然会出现一望无际的辽阔无比的蓝天。
    呵，瓷都的蓝天，人们翘首以盼的蓝天！
