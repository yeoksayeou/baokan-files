A working group composed of the Communist Party of China, democratic parties, and other non-Party personnel is currently working diligently to discuss and consult on how to further develop the system of multi-party cooperation. It is expected that by June or July of this year, a plan that is relatively in line with China's actual situation will be presented. This plan may involve amendments to the constitution and the drafting of some special laws. Today, in the afternoon, at a discussion meeting of the CPPCC Hong Kong and Macau Group, which was attended by Hong Kong and Taiwan journalists, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Yan Mingfu revealed this information.

Yan Mingfu said that China is a country with more than a billion people, with a large population pressure; every year, one-fourth of the new value added to the national economy is consumed by the increasing population; there are also 250 million illiterates and about 80 million impoverished people; and some external elements have been continuously disturbing. He emphasized that the promotion of democratic construction cannot be separated from China's actual situation. It is neither possible to mechanically copy Western practices nor to completely follow the practices of Taiwan in recent years. Instead, it must start from the country's national conditions and the problems existing in the political system.

　　阎明复在政协港澳组讨论会上指出        
    民主建设不能脱离国情
    拟年内形成发展多党合作方案
    本报北京３月２１日讯  记者费伟伟报道：一个由中共和民主党派及其他党外人士共同组成的研讨协商怎样进一步发展多党合作制度的工作小组，目前正在紧张工作，可望在今年６、７月份拿出一个比较符合中国实际的方案。这一方案可能会涉及宪法的修改和一些专门法的制订。全国政协副主席阎明复今天下午在有港台记者参加的政协港澳组讨论会上，透露了这一情况。
    阎明复说，中国是一个十多亿人的大国，人口压力很大，每年国民经济新增产值的１／４，都被增加的人口吃掉了；还有２．５亿的文盲、８０００万左右的贫困群众；境外一些活动分子又连续不断地骚扰。他强调，推进民主建设不能脱离中国这个实际，既不能生搬硬套西方的做法，也不能完全套用台湾这几年的做法，只能从国家的国情出发，从政治体制中存在的问题出发。
