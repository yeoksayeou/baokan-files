	Top 100 Electronic Sales Companies Announced
	Television and Radio Manufacturers Dominate

	BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Machinery and Electronics Industry today announced the list of the top 100 electronic companies for 1989. These companies are ranked based on their product sales revenue for the previous year, placing them among the top 100 electronic enterprises in the country.

	China currently has over 3,000 electronic enterprises. The combined output value, sales revenue, and tax contributions of these top 100 companies account for more than half of the national total.

	Since 1986, the electronic industry has ranked companies based solely on their annual product sales revenue, regardless of ownership or affiliation. This year's list includes Shanghai Television Factory No. 1, which achieved sales revenue of 9.2 billion yuan and topped the list for the third time. Shanghai Kaili Wireless Factory is the only township enterprise on the list. There are 10 joint ventures with foreign partners, and 10 new companies have entered the list this year.

	Statistics show that among the top 100 companies, 54 are involved in the production of televisions and radio-cassette players. This reflects an imbalance in the product structure of the electronic industry, with a significant proportion of consumer goods.

    电子销售大户  前一百名排出
    电视机收录机厂家居多
    本报北京3月2日讯　记者皮树义报道：机械电子工业部今天公布1989年电子百家企业名单。按去年实现的产品销售额排列，这些企业居于全国电子企业的前100名。
    我国现有电子企业3000多家，这百家企业的产值、销售收入、利税总额占一半或一半以上。
    从1986年开始，电子工业就不分所有制和隶属关系，只按企业上年实现的产品销售收入，即为社会提供商品量的多少排列百家企业。这次评出的百家企业中，上海电视机一厂实现销售收入9.2亿元，第3次名列榜首；上海凯乐无线电厂是唯一的乡镇企业；有10家中外合资企业入选；当年新入选的企业达10家。
    据统计，百家企业中，生产电视机、收录机的共有54家。这反映电子工业产品结构还不尽合理，消费类产品所占比重较大。
