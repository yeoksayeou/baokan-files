Central People's Broadcasting Station today released a sampling survey report stating that its first and second programs have 630 million listeners, with 330 million being stable listeners who tune in daily or frequently.

This survey was conducted by the Central People's Broadcasting Station's Audience Department, which commissioned the China Social Survey Institute to carry it out before the New Year. The survey strictly followed social survey and statistical methods, selecting 3,000 individuals aged 12 and above from 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government as the sample. After expert verification, the sample size met the requirements for national extrapolation.

According to the survey, the programs with the highest number of listeners are the Central Station's daily morning "News and Newspaper Digest" and the evening "Broadcast Network Program by Local People's Radio Stations," with 585 million and 580 million listeners respectively. The midday comprehensive program "Half Hour at Noon" has 460 million listeners. The comprehensive arts program "Tonight at 8:30" has nearly 490 million listeners.

The data also shows that although the period from 7 PM to 9 PM is when television programs are concentrated, it remains the time when the most people listen to the radio. 69.5% of listeners tune in to the Central Station's programs during this time.
