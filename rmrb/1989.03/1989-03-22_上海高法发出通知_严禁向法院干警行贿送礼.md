Shanghai High Court Issues Notice
Strictly Prohibit Bribery and Gift-Giving to Judicial Officers

Shanghai, March 21 — In the course of handling and enforcing various types of cases, instances of parties or their relatives bribing and giving gifts to judicial officers in Shanghai's courts at various levels have been occurring frequently. The amounts of money and gifts involved are increasing, and the methods are becoming more concealed. Such actions not only corrupt social morals and judicial officers but also seriously disrupt the normal operation of judicial work. In response, the Shanghai High People's Court recently issued a notice to all levels of courts, demanding a firm halt to this improper practice.

The notice states that all levels of courts must strengthen ideological work, consciously refusing to accept bribes or gifts, and declining invitations to dine. If such incidents occur, they must be immediately reported to the organization, and the money and gifts must be handed over. Those who solicit or accept bribes, engage in corruption, abuse their power for personal gain, or pervert the course of justice must be dealt with seriously. For parties who give large amounts of bribes and whose actions are serious, criminal responsibility should be pursued in accordance with the law, and the money and gifts should be confiscated and turned over to the state treasury. For those who give smaller amounts of money and gifts and whose actions are relatively minor, they should be severely criticized. If Communist Party members or state officials bribe judicial officers, their respective party organizations or relevant departments should be promptly notified.

　　上海高法发出通知        
    严禁向法院干警行贿送礼
    本报上海３月２１日电  上海各级人民法院在审理或执行各类案件中，当事人或其亲属向法院干警行贿、送礼行为不断发生，所送钱物数额越来越大，手段越来越隐蔽。这样做不仅败坏社会风气、腐蚀法院干警，而且严重干扰法院审判工作的正常进行。为此，上海市高级人民法院日前向各级人民法院发出通知，要求坚决刹住这股不正之风。
    通知指出，各级法院要加强思想工作，自觉做到行贿不受，送礼不要，请吃不到。遇有这类事，要立即报告组织，将钱物上交。对于索贿受贿、贪赃卖法、以权谋私、徇私枉法的，必须严肃处理。对行贿数额较大、情节严重的当事人，应依法追究其刑事责任，钱物没收上交国库；对所送钱物数额不大、情节较轻的，应给予严肃批评。共产党员、国家干部向人民法院干警行贿的，应及时通知其所在的党组织或有关部门。
