The Luo River is the primary water source for the lives and production of tens of thousands of people in Luoyang City, Henan Province. On January 29th, a dam built by the Wuyang County Paper Mill upstream on the Luo River to hold back polluted water burst, releasing a large amount of polluted water into the river. On the morning of the Lunar New Year's Eve, residents of Luoyang City found that the water from their taps was brownish-black and foamy. Many families had to discard the food they had prepared for the holiday. In this incident, over 60,000 people drank the polluted water from the Luo River, with 80% of them experiencing abnormal reactions. On February 24th, I went to Luoyang City for an interview and unfortunately fell ill, experiencing vomiting and diarrhea. I had to rush to the hospital for treatment.

The polluted water discharged by the Wuyang County Paper Mill contains lignin, free residual alkali, cellulose, and colloidal substances. These substances, when released in large quantities into the Luo River, not only seriously harm the health of the residents but also have a significant impact on the industrial production of Luoyang City. The rate of defective products in the city's cotton textile factory has increased sharply, 3,000 bottles of self-made sodium chloride injection solution in the Second People's Hospital are unusable, and the products of the city's food processing industry cannot be sold, among other issues.

The Wuyang County Paper Mill is the main source of pollution in the Luo River. In 1986, this paper mill discharged 3,000 tons of paper-making wastewater daily, and its production scale is still expanding. In the same year, Chengguan Town, Chengguan Township, and Wucheng Township in Wuyang County illegally built three more paper mills, significantly increasing the amount of wastewater discharged. As a result, the water in the Luo River turned dark green, making it undrinkable for humans and livestock, and causing fish to die. The water used for production was also severely affected.

The Environmental Protection Office of Luoyang City has submitted six emergency reports to the municipal government, and representatives of the municipal People's Congress have also raised questions to the municipal government. The municipal government has issued three documents, ordering the Wuyang County government to take measures to control the pollution sources. In 1987, the Wuyang County Paper Mill took a passive protective measure by building an earth dam on the Tang River upstream of the Luo River to intercept the polluted water. However, this dam frequently burst, allowing the polluted water to flow freely.

After the dam burst on January 29th, the Wuyang Paper Mill built another dam to intercept the polluted water, but it was unable to contain the "black dragon." On February 20th, the Municipal Party Committee, Municipal People's Congress, Municipal Government, and Municipal Political Consultative Conference had to make a decision: to demolish the dam and release the water. The accumulated 550,000 cubic meters of wastewater gushed out, with the peak of the polluted water flowing out of Luoyang City one week later. This polluted water will successively flow through the Luo River, Sha River, Ying River, Huai River, Hongze Lake, and eventually into the Yangtze River.

### 拦蓄污水大坝决口  澧河沿岸群众遭殃

　　拦蓄污水大坝决口        
    澧河沿岸群众遭殃
    澧河是河南漯河市十几万人生活和生产用水水源。１月２９日，地处澧河上游的舞阳县造纸厂拦蓄污水大坝决口，大量污水排入澧河。除夕早上，漯河市民发现自来水管里流出的是冒着泡沫的棕黑色污水，许多家庭不得不倒掉昨夜做的节日食品。在这次事件中，有６万多人饮用了被污染的澧河水，其中８０％的群众有异常反应。２月２４日，我到漯河市采访，也难逃厄运，身体突感不适，上吐下泻，急忙到医院就医。
    舞阳县造纸厂排出的污水中，含有木质素、游离残碱、纤维素、有质胶物质等，这些物质大量注入澧河，不仅严重损害了群众的身体健康，而且对漯河市的工业也带来很大影响。市棉织厂床单次品率直线上升，市第二人民医院３０００瓶自制氯化钠注射液不能使用，市食品加工行业的产品卖不出去，等等。
    舞阳县造纸厂是澧河的主要污染源。１９８６年，这个造纸厂日排放造纸废水３０００吨，而生产规模仍在继续扩大。同年，舞阳县城关镇、城关乡、吴城乡又擅自新建了３个造纸厂，废水排放量大大增加，致使澧河水变成墨绿色，人畜无法饮用，鱼类无法生存，生产用水也受到严重影响。
    漯河市环境保护办公室曾先后６次向市政府写过紧急报告，市人大代表也曾向市政府提出质询，市政府３次下发文件，责成舞阳县政府采取措施，治理污染源。１９８７年，舞阳县造纸厂采取了一个被动的防护措施。在澧河上游的塘河上筑起一条土坝拦截污水。这条土坝筑起后经常决口，污水肆意横流。
    １月２９日大坝开口后，舞阳造纸厂又筑起一道坝拦截污水，但无法锁住这条“黑龙”。２月２０日，市委、市人大、市政府、市政协不得不做出决定：扒坝放水。积蓄了数年之久的５５万立方米废水一泻而下，污水高峰一个星期后流出漯河市区。这些污水将先后流经澧河、沙河、颍河、淮河、洪泽湖，注入长江。
