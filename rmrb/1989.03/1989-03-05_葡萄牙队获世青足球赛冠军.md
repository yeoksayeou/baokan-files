Portugal defeated Nigeria 2-0 tonight to win the fifth World Youth Football Championship.

Portugal's two goals were scored by number 2 Abel in the 44th minute and number 6 Coto in the 77th minute.

In the previous semi-finals, Portugal eliminated the heavily favored Brazil team with a 1-0 victory, while Nigeria defeated the strong Soviet Union team 9-7. Although Nigeria, known as the "African Cheetahs," had lost 0-1 to Portugal in the group stage, their impressive performances in the knockout rounds and semi-finals earned them widespread praise from the media.

　　葡萄牙队获世青足球赛冠军
    新华社利雅得３月３日电  （记者吴毅宏）葡萄牙队今晚以２∶０击败尼日利亚队，夺得第五届世界青年足球锦标赛冠军。
    葡萄牙队的两个球分别是在４４分钟和７７分钟时由２号阿贝尔和６号科托踢进的。
    在此前的半决赛中，葡萄牙队以１∶０淘汰了夺标呼声最高的巴西队，尼日利亚队以９∶７击败了劲旅苏联队。被誉为“非洲之豹”的尼日利亚队虽然在小组赛中曾以０∶１负于葡萄牙队，但由于该队在复赛和半决赛中表现惊人，受到舆论界一致好评。
