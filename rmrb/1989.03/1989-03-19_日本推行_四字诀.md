According to the Japanese Economic News Agency's publication, "The Era of Light, Thin, Short, and Small," Japan has been promoting the "light, thin, short, and small" mantra in recent years to capture the global market for goods.

Light – Products should be designed to be agile and lightweight, appealing to consumers. Japan has recently developed a new type of suit that weighs only 500 grams for the entire set, an astonishing invention. The same principle applies to other daily items like umbrellas, bags, and boxes, which are self-explanatory.

Thin – The production of consumer goods such as televisions and cameras is moving towards "thinness." Kodak has introduced three types of thin cameras, each only 20 millimeters thick.

Short – This does not simply refer to length but has a deeper meaning. For example, telephones and walkie-talkies can shorten the time it takes to find someone; copiers and typewriters can shorten the time it takes to copy; computers can shorten the time it takes to calculate.

Small – Miniaturization is one of the best ways to open up sales channels for various products. Miniaturization is not just for daily items but also includes the miniaturization of factories, workshops, production equipment, and various service facilities.

　　日本推行“四字诀”
    据日本经济新闻社出版的《轻薄短小时代》杂志报道，近年来，日本以推行“轻、薄、短、小”４字诀，占领世界商品大市场。
    轻——产品要讲求灵巧轻便，惹人喜爱。日本新研制出一种西装，全套仅重５００克，可谓惊人的发明。对其它日用品像雨伞、提包、箱子等更是不言而喻。
    薄——电视机、照像机之类的消费品的生产已向“薄”发展。柯达公司推出三种薄型照像机，其厚度仅２０毫米。
    短——不是单纯指长度，而有更深的含义。如电话机、对讲机可缩短找人的时间；复印机、打字机可缩短抄写时间；电子计算机可缩短运算时间。
    小——小型化是打开各种产品销路的最佳途径之一。小型化不仅指日用品，还包括厂房、车间、生产设备和各种服务设施的小型化。
