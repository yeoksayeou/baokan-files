	Editor's Note: As the saying goes, "Good medicine tastes bitter, and honest words are hard to hear." When faced with our work's shortcomings and errors and society's negative phenomena, some comrades, regardless of personal gain or loss, dare to write frankly and boldly criticize. This is a responsible attitude towards the Party and the people's cause. Towards the masses' criticisms, some leaders welcome criticism and strive to improve, while others avoid and resent it, even retaliating against those who raise issues. Comparing the two, it is clear which attitude is enlightened and beneficial to reform and opening up. Even if the masses' criticisms have some inaccuracies, or even if they are wrong, as long as they are not fabricated, leaders should correctly handle them and not resort to suppression or retaliation. Of course, we hope that comrades who write criticism articles will be cautious and strive to ensure the facts are accurate and the criticism is objective and fair.

	Two Attitudes Towards My Criticism Articles

	Last year on March 27th, my article titled "Farmers Should Be Wary, Distinguishing True from False When Buying Seeds" was broadcast on our province's People's Radio Station. On March 31st, it was also published in the Farmers' Friend newspaper. Many farmers in the town praised me for doing the right thing.

	However, I did not expect that on the morning of April 6th, someone called me to the town leader's office. A town official scolded me, saying I only exposed the dark side and that I would be criticized at the city's propaganda work meeting. Another person sitting in the town leader's office said sarcastically, "At your age, if you want to earn some cigarette money, there are plenty of places to get it. Why do you have to do this?" The relevant person in charge at the town's agricultural technology station also got very angry about my writing the criticism article.

	Later, I met with the director of the city's propaganda department's news section. As soon as he saw me, he said, "In news work, don't be afraid to tackle hard issues. In the future, you should write more." My town's party committee secretary also said, "Old Wang, why are you in a bad mood? Be bold and do it! I support you!" The director of the city's propaganda department also praised me at a meeting.

	Before this, I had decided to stop writing. Later, with the concern and support of some leaders, I ignored some people's difficulties and picked up my pen again, criticizing negative social trends and praising the new customs of the times. Last year, 120 of my articles were published.

### 对我写批评稿的两种态度

专栏：心里话

　　编者按：常言道，良药苦口，忠言逆耳。面对我们工作中的缺点错误和社会上的不良现象，一些同志不顾个人得失，敢于秉笔直书，大胆批评，这是一种对党和人民事业负责的态度。对待群众的批评，一些领导人闻过则喜，“有则改之，无则加勉”；而有些领导人却讳疾忌医，甚至对提意见的同志打击报复。两相对照，哪种态度开明，有益于改革开放，是不言自明的。群众的批评即使有些出入，甚至批评错了，只要不是无中生有，领导干部就应正确对待，而不应采取压制、报复的手段。当然，我们希望写批评稿的同志一定要慎重，尽量做到事实准确，客观公正。
    对我写批评稿的两种态度
    去年３月２７日，我采写的题为《农民兄弟要警惕，购买良种辨真伪》的批评稿件在我省人民广播电台播出，３月３１日，农民之友报也予以刊登。镇里不少农民赞扬我做得对。
    但没料到，４月６日一早，有人把我叫到镇长办公室，镇里的一位干部把我训斥一番，说我光暴露阴暗面，要在全市宣传干事会上批评我。坐在镇长办公室的另一个人阴阳怪气地说：“你这么大年纪了，要想弄点烟钱，哪里弄不到，何至于这样。”镇农技站有关负责人也为我写批评稿的事大发脾气。
    后来，我见到了市委宣传部新闻科科长，他一见面就对我说：“搞新闻工作，不要怕碰硬，今后你要多写。”我镇党委书记也说：“老汪，怎么闹情绪了？大胆干，我支持你！”市委宣传部部长还在一次会上表扬了我。
    在这之前，我曾决定搁笔不写了。后来，在一些领导同志的关心和支持下，我不顾有些人的刁难，重新拿起笔，抨击社会不良风气，赞美时代的新风尚。去年１１个月，我写的稿件见报１２０多篇。
