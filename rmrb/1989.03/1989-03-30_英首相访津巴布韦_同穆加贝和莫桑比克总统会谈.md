Xinhua News Agency, Harare, March 28th.

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher arrived in Harare on March 28th to begin a two-day visit to Zimbabwe. This is the first visit by a British Prime Minister since Zimbabwe's independence in 1980.

Thatcher told the press at Harare International Airport that the situation in southern Africa has undergone some changes, and the developments in Namibia have shown that people have come to realize that disputes can be resolved through negotiations.

She added that negotiations require hard preparatory work and patience.

She hopes that efforts to resolve the Namibian issue will be respected by all parties concerned.

Zimbabwean President Mugabe, who welcomed Thatcher at the airport, said that although the two countries have differing views on some issues, their relations remain close.

During her visit, Thatcher will hold talks with President Mugabe and Mozambican President Chissano on issues related to southern Africa.

Prior to this, Thatcher had visited Morocco and Nigeria during her four-nation tour of Africa.
