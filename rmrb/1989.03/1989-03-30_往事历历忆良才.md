	Memories of Comrade Zhu Liangcai
	The proletarian revolutionary, outstanding political work leader, and military commander of our army, Comrade Zhu Liangcai, has passed away. The news of his passing brought immense sorrow. The 50-plus years of our comradeship in arms have left me with countless memories, and the events of the past come flooding back.

	I first met Comrade Liangcai in May 1930. At that time, I was transferred from the Political Department of the Propaganda Section of the Third Column of the Fourth Red Army to the 25th Battalion of the Ninth Column as the Political Commissar. Comrade Liangcai was the Political Commissar of the Ninth Column. From our first meeting, his sincere dedication to the revolution and his warm, open-hearted demeanor left a deep impression on me.

	Since I had just returned to the Red Army in the Soviet area after a long and arduous journey during the Zhejiang-Fujian Campaign, Comrade Liangcai not only provided me with detailed information about the unit but also personally introduced me to the troops, recounting my experiences since joining the revolution in 1926. This allowed me to start my work smoothly in an atmosphere of mutual understanding and unity.

	Comrade Liangcai was approachable and sincere with his comrades. We all enjoyed visiting him. Sometimes we would have heart-to-heart talks, other times we would discuss work over a meal. Comrade Liangcai had been a primary school teacher before participating in the Hunan peasant movement, and he was very good at explaining revolutionary principles. At that time, he often spoke to us about his personal experiences at the Gutian Conference. When he talked about the erroneous tendencies that existed in the Fourth Red Army before the Gutian Conference, his brow would furrow with concern; when he spoke about the great victory achieved at the Gutian Conference, where the Red Army, under the party's banner, achieved unity in thought and politics and embarked on the correct path, his face would light up with excitement. He told us that on the day the Gutian Conference concluded successfully, the delegates were all very happy. As soon as the conference was declared closed, Comrade Mao Zedong stood up, excitedly leading us in shouting slogans! We were greatly inspired and felt immense joy. From Comrade Liangcai, I felt the sincere devotion of a Communist to the party, to Comrade Mao, and to the Red Army, sharing their breath and fate. Later, Comrade Liangcai repeatedly told us that the resolutions of the Gutian Conference regarding the nature, purpose, and tasks of the Red Army were all correct and must be firmly implemented. In his actual work, he consistently and unwaveringly carried out the spirit of the resolutions. He often went deep into the grassroots to inspect the implementation of the resolutions, especially the implementation of the three great democracies in military, political, and economic affairs, the elimination of the remnants of militarism, the practice of equality between officers and soldiers, and the strengthening of party branch construction and political work. Under the guidance of the spirit of the Gutian Conference, the Red Army's morale was greatly improved, and its combat effectiveness was significantly enhanced.

	Comrade Liangcai was very brave in battle. In the frequent battles in the Soviet area, he always demonstrated the revolutionary spirit of a Communist who leads from the front, cares for the soldiers, and is fearless and persevering. He was praised by Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhu De.

	In the Soviet area, after experiencing hardships and returning to the Red Army, I fought alongside Comrade Liangcai. In the later stages of the Long March, he endured extreme hardships and finally found the Western Support Army that was assisting the Western Route Army. In early 1937, we were in the same unit again. At that time, the Red Army's Western Route Army was marching westward, and the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission established the Western Support Army with Liu Bocheng as the commander and Zhang Hao as the political commissar. I was then the head of the Organization Department of the Political Department. After the Political Department Director Liu Xiao left, I successively served as the deputy director and director of the Political Department, also holding the position of head of the Organization Department. To help the scattered soldiers of the Western Route Army quickly find the Red Army, the Western Support Army posted many notices along the road from Lanzhou to Xi'an, indicating the location of the Red Army. In Zhenyuan, Gansu, a unit of the Western Support Army received an old man who was walking with difficulty. His face was black and thin, his beard was long and disheveled, but his eyes were bright and his expression was resolute. It turned out that he was Comrade Zhu Liangcai, the deputy director of the Political Department of the 30th Army of the Western Route Army. Due to excessive fatigue, prolonged tension, and sudden excitement, Comrade Liangcai coughed up blood and could not speak a word...

	Upon hearing this, I immediately went to visit Comrade Liangcai. Old comrades meeting again, we had a lot to say. Comrade Liangcai had endured countless hardships and tribulations to find us. Comrade Liangcai told me that the Western Route Army had fought for a long time, and in Nijiacun, they were surrounded by enemy forces. The Red Army soldiers fought bravely for more than 40 days, but they were outnumbered. Comrade Liangcai and a few surviving comrades from the 30th Army broke through the encirclement in the Qilian Mountains, fighting the enemy. Unfortunately, as soon as it was dawn, they were captured by another enemy force. Taking advantage of the enemy's search for foreign currency, they scattered and escaped under the gunfire. In the end, Comrade Liangcai was left alone. The tragedy of the loss of the unit, the loneliness of being alone, as well as the harsh winter winds and hunger, could not cool Comrade Liangcai's heart. He had only one thought: to march east and find the Red Army, to return to the unit! He found a coal miner and exchanged a worn sheepskin coat, disguising himself and marching east. He hid during the day and traveled at night, looking at the stars, enduring hunger and thirst, and braving the dangers. He walked, walked, for 36 days! With an unshakable belief and indomitable will, he fought with death every day. He had once, when encountering the enemy, turned his sheepskin coat inside out and lay among the sheep to avoid the enemy; he had once, on a bare hill with no cover, jumped into a deep crevice to avoid the enemy's search. The brave and tenacious Comrade Liangcai was not only dragging a body without food and water but also a body with nine battle wounds and a missing arm! Enemies were everywhere, and there were wanted posters everywhere. Comrade Liangcai, who remained steadfast until death, had once walked behind the enemy's ranks past the enemy's sentry post; he had once risked his life to sneak into the ranks of captured Red Army soldiers to inquire about the whereabouts of the Red Army units. He endured hunger and thirst, crossing one danger after another, and finally, with his last bit of strength, found the Red Army! I was proud of Comrade Liangcai, and I was proud of such a true Communist.

	Comrade Liangcai's arrival made me very happy. At my suggestion and with the approval of the Western Support Army Party Committee, Comrade Liangcai was appointed as the head of the Organization Department of the Political Department of the Western Support Army. We once again began our life of fighting side by side. For the returning personnel of the Western Route Army, the Political Department of the Western Support Army, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee, quickly conducted examinations and screenings. Except for a few individuals who had clearly betrayed the cause, all were trusted and their party life was quickly restored, and they were reassigned to new positions. Due to Comrade Liangcai's upright style and his familiarity with various aspects of the Western Route Army, the above work was carried out smoothly, and a large number of returning comrades from the Western Route Army quickly took up new positions.

	Soon, the full-scale War of Resistance against Japan broke out. Comrade Liangcai went to Lanzhou with Comrade Xie Jueying to the Eighth Route Army Office, serving as the secretary-general. There, he worked with Comrade Xie on united front work, continuing to search for and rescue personnel from the Western Route Army.

	After parting ways with Comrade Liangcai, I often missed this old comrade-in-arms who had fought side by side with me through life and death. In the early days of the war of resistance, I suggested to Comrade Liu, the commander, and Comrade Deng, the political commissar, that Comrade Liangcai, who was then serving as the deputy director of the Political Department of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, be transferred to the Political Department of the 129th Division to take charge of the work. Because the work there could not be left, Comrade Liangcai remained in Jin-Cha-Ji. Later, he worked in the North China Military Region and the Beijing Military Region.

	During the ten years of turmoil, Comrade Liangcai deeply hated the counter-revolutionary actions of the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing clique and remained loyal to the party and steadfast in the cause of communism. Comrade Liangcai also stood up and provided truthful testimony regarding the historical issues of myself and other old comrades.

	Reflecting on Comrade Liangcai's life of struggle for the party's cause, his bright and upright, unyielding Communist character is admirable. Liangcai has left us, but his excellent qualities will forever remain in our hearts.

　　往事历历忆良才
    无产阶级革命家、我军优秀的政治工作领导者和军事指挥员朱良才同志与世长辞了。噩耗传来，悲痛万分。５０多年的战斗友情令我追怀不已，历历往事涌上心头。
    我和良才同志相识于１９３０年５月。当时，我由红四军三纵队政治部宣传科调到九支队２５大队任政治委员，良才同志是九支队政治委员。初次见面，他那对革命的赤诚和热情，对同志的坦荡胸怀和和蔼可亲的作风，就给我留下了深刻的印象。
    由于我刚刚经过艰苦辗转在直下战役中重新返回苏区红军工作，良才同志一方面详细地向我介绍部队的情况，一方面亲自向部队介绍我１９２６年参加革命以后的经历，使我一开始就能在相互了解、上下一心的局面下顺利地进行工作。
    良才同志平易近人，对同志热情诚恳，我们都乐意到他那里去坐。有时促膝谈心，有时边吃边研究工作。良才同志参加湖南农民运动前是小学教员，很会讲革命道理。当时给我们讲得最多的，是他亲自参加的古田会议的情形。当他讲到古田会议之前红四军中存在的一些错误倾向时，忧虑之情凝于眉间；当讲到古田会议取得的伟大胜利，红军在党的旗帜下达到了思想和政治的统一，走上了正确的道路时，兴奋激动之情溢于言表。他向我们介绍到：古田会议胜利结束的那一天，代表们都非常高兴。大会一宣布胜利闭幕，毛泽东同志兴奋地站起来，激动地带领我们呼起了口号！我们听了，受到很大鼓舞，感到无比喜悦。从良才同志身上，我感到了一个共产党人同党、同毛委员、同红军部队同呼吸共命运的赤诚之心。此后，良才同志又不止一次地对我们讲，古田会议决议中规定的红军性质、宗旨和任务，都是非常正确的，一定要坚决执行。在实际工作中，他更是坚定不移地贯彻执行决议精神。他经常深入基层，检查“决议”落实的情况，特别是实行军事、政治、经济三大民主，废除军阀主义残余，实行官兵平等和加强党支部建设、加强政治工作的情况。在古田会议精神指导下，红军部队的精神面貌焕然一新，战斗力有了很大的提高。
    良才同志打仗非常勇敢，在苏区的频繁战斗中他处处体现着共产党员身先士卒、爱护士兵和不畏艰险、坚韧不拔的革命精神，曾受到毛泽东、朱德同志的赞扬。
    在苏区，我经历了艰辛辗转重返红军部队，与良才同志战斗在一起。长征后期，他历尽艰苦卓绝的斗争，终于找到接应西路军的援西军，又与我在一个部队共事。那是１９３７年初，红军西路军向西进军中，党中央、中央军委成立了刘伯承任司令员、张浩任政委的援西军，我当时担任政治部组织部长。政治部主任刘晓调离后，我先后任政治部副主任、主任并兼组织部长。为了使失散的西路军将士尽快找到红军，援西军在兰州至西安的路上，张贴了许多指明红军驻地的通知。在甘肃镇原，援西军某团部进来了一个步履艰难的“老头”，黑瘦的面庞，长乱的胡子，但目光炯炯，神情刚毅。原来他就是西路军三十军政治部副主任朱良才同志。由于过度的疲劳、长期的紧张和突然的兴奋，良才口吐鲜血，一句话也讲不出来……
    我得知后，马上赶去看望良才同志。老战友重逢，感慨万千。良才同志是历尽了千辛万险、百般磨难才找到我们的。良才同志告诉我，西路军经过长期血战，在倪家营被敌人重兵包围，红军将士又苦战４０余天，但寡不敌众。良才和三十军的十几名幸存的同志一起，饮恨舍命突围，在祁连山中与敌周旋。不幸，天一亮又被一股敌人抓住。乘敌人搜身找洋钱之机，他们冒着枪弹四散逃脱。最后良才同志剩下了孤影一人。部队损失的悲怆，形只影单的孤独，以及严冬寒风，辘辘饥肠，都没能冷却良才同志的心。他心中只有一个念头：东进找红军，回部队！他找到一名煤矿工人，换了一件旧羊皮袄，化装东进。他昼伏夜行，眼望着星斗，忍着饥渴，冒着四伏的危险，走，走，一直走了３６天！凭着毫不动摇的信念和坚韧的意志，他每天都在与死神搏斗。他曾经在与敌遭遇之时，翻穿皮袄躺在羊群中躲过了敌人；他曾在荒无遮挡的秃岭上，毅然跳进一个深深的裂缝中避开了敌人的搜捕。英勇顽强的良才同志，拖的不仅是无食无水滋养的身体，而且是身负九处战伤和断臂之后的残疾之躯！到处是敌军，到处是杀头悬赏的布告。至死不移的良才同志，曾经排在敌军队伍后面走过敌人桥头的岗哨；曾经冒死钻进被俘红军的队列里打探红军部队的下落。他挨饿忍渴，闯过一道道险关，在耗尽最后的精力之际，终于找到了红军！我为良才战友自豪，我为这样的真正共产党人骄傲。
    良才同志的到来，我非常高兴。由我提议，经援西军党委批准，良才同志被任命为援西军政治部组织部长。我们再次开始了并肩战斗的生活。对于归来的西路军人员，援西军政治部遵照中央指示，迅速进行审查甄别，除了个别确有叛变行为者外，一律予以信任，及时恢复党的生活，重新分配工作。由于良才同志作风正派，又对西路军各方面情况比较了解，使上述工作进行得很顺利，大批西路军归来的同志很快走上新的战斗岗位。
    不久，抗日战争全面爆发。良才同志随谢觉哉同志到了兰州八路军办事处，任秘书长。在那里，他同谢老一起作统战工作，继续寻找和营救西路军干部战士。
    我与良才同志分别之后，心中常常思念这位并肩战斗、生死与共的老战友。抗战初期，我曾向刘司令、邓政委建议调在晋察冀军区任政治部副主任的良才同志到一二九师政治部主持工作。由于那里的工作离不开，良才同志一直留在晋察冀，后在华北军区、北京军区作领导工作。
    十年动乱中，良才同志对林彪、江青反革命集团的倒行逆施深恶痛绝，始终对党忠心耿耿，对共产主义事业坚定不移。良才同志还挺身而出，实事求是地为我和其他一些老同志的历史问题提供证明。
    回想起良才同志为党的事业英勇奋斗的一生，他那光明磊落、刚直不阿的共产党人品格，使人敬佩。良才离开我们了，他的优秀品德永远留在我们的心间。
