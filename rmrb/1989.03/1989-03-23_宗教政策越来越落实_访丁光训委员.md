Ding Guangxun, 73, President of the Chinese Christian Council, a member of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, and a newly appointed member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, was interviewed by our reporter at the Great Hall of the People.

Reporter (hereafter referred to as "Rep"): How do you evaluate the implementation of religious policies in recent years? What areas still need improvement?

Ding Guangxun (hereafter referred to as "Ding"): It's hard to sum up in one sentence. Generally speaking, I feel that religious belief policies are increasingly being implemented and are making progress. Take Christianity, for example. In the past nine years, three new churches have been opened every two days. During the Cultural Revolution, all churches were closed. After rectifying the wrongs, more and more churches have been opened.

Rep: There must be a lot of people attending services, right?

Ding: Yes, there are many. This shows religious freedom. Additionally, we need to cultivate the next generation of patriotic, qualified pastoral workers. Currently, there are 13 theological seminaries in Christianity, with over 700 students. Therefore, I say that religious freedom is increasingly being implemented.

However, China is very large. In some places, some cadres are not enthusiastic about implementing religious policies, and some are not enthusiastic at all. This is, of course, a minority. During the period when extreme leftist thoughts were rampant, newspapers either did not discuss religion, or if they did, they equated religion with opium. Now, such articles are rarely seen. Today, people generally consider religion to be a part of culture.

Rep: Can we say that this understanding has created an increasingly better external environment for the implementation of religious policies and for religious activities?

Ding: Yes. Nine years ago, there were no Christian churches, and now there are over 5,000. There are four to five million believers.

Rep: Has it not been restored to the historical peak?

Ding: No, no, no! Today is the period with the most people in history. At the time of liberation in 1949, there were only 700,000 people.

　　“宗教政策越来越落实”        
    ——访丁光训委员
    本报记者  张何平
    丁光训（图左），73岁，中国基督教协会会长，七届全国人大常委，新增补的全国政协委员。记者在人民大会堂采访了他。
    记者（以下简称“记”）：如何评价近几年宗教政策落实的情况？还有哪些有待改进的地方？
    丁光训（以下简称“丁”）：这很难用一句话来评价。总的来说，我觉得宗教信仰政策越来越落实，是在进步当中。拿基督教来说，９年来，每两天开３个新堂。“文革”中，所有的堂都被关掉了。“拨乱反正”后，堂越来越多。
    记：作礼拜的人很多吧？
    丁：很多。这就是体现了宗教信仰自由。另外，我们还要培养下一代的，爱国的，有水平的教牧人员。现在基督教有１３所神学院校，有７００多个学生。所以，我说宗教信仰自由越来越落实。
    但是，我们中国非常之大。有些地方，有些干部对落实宗教政策不那么起劲，甚至根本不起劲。这当然是少数了。极左思潮泛滥时期，报纸上要么不谈宗教，一谈宗教就是“鸦片”，把宗教同鸦片等同起来。现在，这种文章很少看见。今天，大家认为宗教也是文化的一部分。
    记：是否可以认为，这种认识对落实宗教政策，使宗教界开展活动，创造了越来越好的外部环境？
    丁：是的。９年前，基督教堂一所没有，现在有５０００多所，教徒有四五百万。
    记：没有恢复到历史高峰时期吧？
    丁：不，不，不！今天是历史上人数最多的时期。１９４９年解放时，只有７０万人。
