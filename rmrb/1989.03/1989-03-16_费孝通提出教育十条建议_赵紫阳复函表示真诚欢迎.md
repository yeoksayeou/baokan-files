Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 15th. (Reporter He Ping) Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Fei Xiaotong, recently wrote to the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Ziyang, proposing ten suggestions on China's education issues. In his reply dated March 11, Zhao Ziyang pointed out: "The letter of suggestions put forward many good and important opinions." Zhao Ziyang also expressed that "relevant departments will be instructed to study and absorb these suggestions."

In his reply, Zhao Ziyang said: "Over the past decade, although China's education sector has made annual progress, there are still many important issues that have not been well addressed. We sincerely welcome all democratic parties and those who care about education to work with us to improve education."

The Central Committee of the China Democratic League collected opinions and suggestions on education issues through local branches and members of the league, which were then compiled and discussed. Fei Xiaotong, as the Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, wrote to Zhao Ziyang, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China. The ten suggestions on education issues proposed in the letter are as follows:

1. To conduct a nationwide discussion on the role and function of education in national economic construction and social development, as well as on educational ideology, policies, systems, and measures, and to conduct a realistic summary and review.
2. To quickly establish the educational policy of improving the overall quality of the nation and cultivating qualified citizens for a socialist motherland.
3. To improve the social, political, and economic status of teachers and to quickly stabilize the teaching workforce.
4. To increase educational investment and improve educational conditions.
5. To comprehensively reform the educational system and vigorously promote public education.
6. To quickly take measures to rectify certain mistakes in educational policies.
7. To purify the external environment of education, revitalize education, and turn the vicious cycle into a virtuous cycle.
8. To strengthen moral education and improve students' moral qualities.
9. To rebuild literacy education and stabilize the number of students in school.
10. To accelerate educational legislation and implement the rule of law in education.

Zhao Ziyang said in his reply: "The Central Committee of the Communist Party will soon hold a meeting to discuss education issues. In the draft document, many good suggestions from the China Democratic League have been reflected, some have not been reflected or have not been sufficiently reflected. Relevant departments will be instructed to study and absorb these suggestions. For some issues, the State Education Commission will further discuss and consult with the China Democratic League."

Zhao Ziyang pointed out: "In recent years, the China Democratic League and other democratic parties have actively participated in politics and policy-making, implemented democratic supervision, and proposed important suggestions on many issues in national construction." He expressed: "We will adhere to and improve the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party and the system of political consultation. We hope that all democratic parties will encourage and guide their members and the masses they are connected with to continue to maintain China's stable, united, democratic, and harmonious political situation, to solidly promote the construction of socialist democratic politics, and to work together to advance various tasks of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and comprehensively deepening reforms."
