China's science and technology breakthrough plan will be divided into three levels starting in the Eighth Five-Year Plan, with national, industrial, and regional focuses.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th (reporter Chen Jinwu), the State Planning Commission will change the management of the science and technology breakthrough plan. Starting in the Eighth Five-Year Plan, the national science and technology breakthrough plan will be organized into three parts: national, industrial, and regional, gradually forming a multi-level, three-dimensional planning model of national, departmental, and regional levels.

Deputy Director of the Science and Technology Department of the State Planning Commission, Jiang Junlu, said today at the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" national key science and technology breakthrough work meeting, "The science and technology breakthrough plans for the Sixth and Seventh Five-Year Plans were single-layered, which was not conducive to giving full play to the enthusiasm of all parties. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, the national breakthrough plan will be the focus of the national science and technology breakthrough plan, concentrating efforts to solve major problems that are of a comprehensive nature, crossing regions and industries; industrial breakthrough plans will focus on industrial priorities, selecting key scientific and technological problems that play a crucial role in promoting industrial development for breakthroughs; regions should also plan to gradually establish distinctive breakthrough plans, concentrating efforts to solve important scientific and technological problems according to the actual situation of the region's resources and economic development.

　　我国科技攻关计划“八五”起分三个层次
    国家、行业、地区各有重点
    据新华社北京３月１０日电  （记者陈金武）国家计委将改变科技攻关计划的管理，从“八五”起按国家、行业、地区三个部分组织全国科技攻关计划，逐步形成国家级、部门行业级和区域地方级的多层次立体结构的计划模式。
    国家计委科技司副司长姜均露今天在“七五”国家重点科技攻关工作会议上说，“六五”、“七五”的科技攻关计划是只有国家级的单层次结构，不利于发挥各方面的积极作用。在“八五”期间，国家攻关计划将是全国科技攻关计划的重点，将集中力量解决带有全局性的跨地区、跨行业的重大问题；行业攻关计划将突出行业重点，选择那些对推动行业发展起关键作用的重要科技问题加以突破；地方也要有计划地逐步建立各具特色的攻关计划，根据本地区的资源特点、经济发展状况等实际情况，集中力量解决重要科技问题。
