Spring Tidings from the Loess Plateau
— An Interview with National People's Congress Representative and Governor of Shaanxi Province Hou Zongbin

Reporter: Yuán Jiàndá

National People's Congress Representative and Governor of Shaanxi Province Hou Zongbin took advantage of his lunch break to accept an interview with our reporter.

Hou Zongbin, with a Hebei accent, spoke with confidence and excitement. He said that after half a year of rectification and adjustment, Shaanxi Province has significantly reduced a number of construction projects, clearing and suspending 286 public fixed asset investment projects, and reducing investment by 580 million yuan. Due to a series of effective measures, the tight monetary situation has been eased, and a number of key construction projects have been guaranteed. Hou Zongbin said with deep feeling that Shaanxi Province's proposed measures of compression, tightening, adjustment, and strengthening are in line with the central government's policies, which has produced significant economic and social effects.

Governor Hou Zongbin has conducted in-depth investigations in 70 counties to understand the provincial conditions and local customs. The four decisions he proposed for Shaanxi—strengthening agriculture, science and technology, education, market management, and population control, land management, and environmental protection—were made after careful investigation, detailed research, and serious deliberation.

Rectification and adjustment have brought a good momentum to Shaanxi's economy and have eliminated some of the public's grievances. Since the second half of last year, the province has uncovered more than 2,100 criminal gangs and handled over 900 cases of economic crimes such as smuggling and fraud, recovering more than 20 million yuan in economic losses for the state. Hou Zongbin said that without cracking down on illegal and criminal activities, social stability cannot be achieved, and nothing can be done. The central government hopes for stability, and the people also hope for a stable living environment. This "big direction" is consistent.

Governor Hou is not someone who only talks about achievements and avoids problems. When he talked to the reporter about some political, economic, and social problems in Shaanxi, he showed a deep sense of responsibility. He believes that as a representative of the people and a provincial leader, one cannot use objective reasons to cover up one's own mistakes. Only by working hard and being practical can one overcome difficulties and strive to achieve the set goals.

　　黄土高坡的春讯        
    ——访全国人大代表、陕西省省长侯宗宾
    本报记者  袁建达
    全国人大代表、陕西省省长侯宗宾利用中午休息时间接受了记者的采访。
    侯宗宾河北口音里洋溢着信心和兴奋。他说，经过半年的治理、整顿，陕西省着力压缩了一批基建项目，清理并停缓建全民固定资产投资项目２８６个，压缩投资５．８亿元。由于采取了一系列有效措施，货币回笼紧张状况得到了缓解，一批重点建设项目得到了保证。侯宗宾深有感触地说，陕西省先后提出的一压缩、二收紧、三调整、四加强措施，正好与中央方针吻合，这就产生了很明显的经济和社会效应。
    省长侯宗宾为了了解省情民风，深入调查了７０个县。他提出的陕西今后要加强农业，加强科技和教育，加强市场和管理，加强人口控制、土地管理、环境保护的四项决策，就是通过细致的调查、详细的研究和认真的论证后提出来的。
    治理、整顿使陕西的经济出现了好的势头，也切除了一些群众痛恨的痈疽。去年下半年以来，全省查获犯罪团伙２１００多个，查处走私、诈骗等经济犯罪案件９００多起，为国家挽回经济损失２０００多万元。侯宗宾说，不打击违法犯罪活动，社会不稳定，干什么都无从谈起。中央希望稳定，群众也希望自己生活环境稳定，这个“大方向”是一致的。
    侯省长不是一个光讲成绩不谈问题的人。他向记者谈到陕西存在的某些政治、经济、社会问题时，流露出一种深深的责任感。他认为，作为人民的代表，作为省级领导人，决不能用客观原因来掩盖自己工作上的失误。只有鼓足干劲，脚踏实地去干，才能克服困难，努力实现预定的目标。
