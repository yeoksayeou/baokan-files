The 128 train from Hefei to Beijing has been plagued by a series of strange incidents and dangerous situations. This is what the reporter Shen Xingeng witnessed and experienced on February 25.

The train was severely overcrowded, with people standing on the floor and squatting on small tables. Some people even had others sitting on them. However, a group of vendors selling fruit, ice pops, and soda—at least four or five per car—added to the chaos, moving through the cars and causing passengers to stumble. The vendors' cries, children's screams, and passengers' curses filled the entire car. The filthiness of the car is beyond imagination for those who have not ridden it. Garbage was everywhere, making it difficult to walk; the toilets were overflowing with feces and urine, but the train attendants turned a blind eye. They hid in the "train attendant room," not even announcing the station names, causing several passengers who were supposed to transfer at Tianjin to end up in Beijing.

During the nearly 20-hour journey, not a drop of water was supplied. Due to the overcrowding and the overflowing toilets, using the restroom became a major problem. The reporter saw a passenger, in a moment when the train stopped, open the window and jump onto the tracks to urinate. If it weren't for desperation, who would take such a risk?

When the train reached Cangzhou, a middle-aged passenger tried to enter car 3 but was stopped by the train attendant at the door. An argument ensued, and during the struggle, the passenger was thrown to the ground by the attendant. At this point, a train attendant from car 4 came over and, without asking any questions, kicked the passenger's head while he was on the ground. The passenger immediately lost consciousness. Shortly after, police from the station arrived and detained the two violent train attendants.

　　一二八次列车怪事迭出险象环生：
    厕所间粪便横流　车厢里饮水难得 
    众小贩穿梭叫卖　列车员大打出手
    本报讯  记者沈兴耕报道：合肥至北京的１２８次列车真是怪事迭出，险象环生。这是记者于２月２５日目睹并真切体验到的。
    这车严重超员，地上站着人，小茶桌上蹲着人，有的人身上还坐着人。然而，一群卖水果、卖冰棍、卖汽水的小贩——一节车厢少说也有四五个，还来凑热闹，他们随车行走，来回穿梭，挤得旅客东倒西歪。小贩的叫卖声，小孩的哭喊声，旅客的咒骂声，充斥着整个车厢。车厢的肮脏程度，不乘车的人是很难想象的。车厢里垃圾遍地，堆得使人无法下脚；厕所里屎尿横流，列车员视而不见。他们躲在“列车员室”，连站名也不报，有几个本应在天津转车的旅客误乘到了北京。
    在近２０个小时的旅途中，车上没有供应一滴水。由于拥挤和粪便四溢，上厕所成为一大难题。记者亲眼看见，一位旅客在列车暂停的一刹那，打开车窗跳到铁轨上小便。若不是出于无奈，他何以冒这么大的风险？
    车到沧州，一位中年旅客要上３号车厢，却被看门的列车员拦住，两人争吵起来。在拉扯中，旅客被列车员摔倒在地。这时，４号车厢一位列车员走过来，不分青红皂白，对着躺在地上的旅客的脑袋就是一脚，那人顿时昏了过去。不久，车站派出所的民警赶来，才将两名行凶的列车员扣下。
