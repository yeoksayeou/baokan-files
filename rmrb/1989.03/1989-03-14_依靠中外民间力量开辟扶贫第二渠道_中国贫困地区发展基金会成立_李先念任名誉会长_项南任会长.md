In addition to utilizing government forces for poverty alleviation, China has opened a second channel for poverty alleviation by leveraging domestic and foreign social forces. This organization, known as the "second channel," is the nationwide civil poverty alleviation association—the China Poverty Alleviation Fund, which was established in Beijing today with the approval of the State Council.

Li Xiannian serves as the honorary chairman of the fund, while Xian Nan serves as the chairman. Lin Hujia and Li Renjun serve as advisors.

The China Poverty Alleviation Fund is a non-profit civil organization. Its mission is to widely solicit support from various domestic and foreign forces for the development of China's poverty-stricken areas and to accept various forms of assistance beneficial to China's poverty-stricken areas. The establishment of this fund changes the traditional way of relying solely on government financial allocations and bank loans for poverty alleviation, opening up new channels for funding sources and usage. Chen Junsheng, a State Councilor currently conducting investigations outside the province, wrote in a congratulatory message to the fund that this is "an important reform and development" in China's poverty alleviation work in the context of reform and opening up.

Li Xiannian said at today's inaugural meeting, "Various levels of government should not reduce funding to poverty-stricken areas just because this fund exists. Under fiscal conditions, money should be allocated to poverty-stricken areas, and not a single penny should be deducted; otherwise, it would be a lack of party spirit and a lack of concern for the people." He emphasized that poverty alleviation funds must be used for "production development and absolutely not for other purposes." Chairman Xian Nan summarized the fund's work guidelines as: "Only service, no profit, only assistance, no replacement. More blood transfusion, less blood donation, more development, less relief. To get rid of poverty, rely on self-reliance; to get rich, rely on science and technology."

It is understood that the fund will carry out a series of activities to make domestic and foreign social circles better understand and care about China's poverty-stricken areas, becoming a window for the more than 600 poverty-stricken counties mainly distributed in China's central and western regions to open up to the outside world. Song Renqing, Wang Renzhong, Du Runsheng, Tong Dalin, Qin Chuan, and other figures from various circles attended the meeting.

　　依靠中外民间力量开辟扶贫第二渠道
    中国贫困地区发展基金会成立
    李先念任名誉会长　项南任会长
    本报北京３月１３日讯  记者凌志军报道：我国贫困地区的发展，在动用政府力量扶贫之外，又开辟出一条依靠国内外社会力量扶贫的渠道。这个被称为“第二渠道”的组织，就是经国务院批准于今天在北京成立的全国性民间扶贫社团——中国贫困地区发展基金会。
    李先念出任基金会名誉会长，项南任会长，林乎加、李人俊任顾问。
    中国贫困地区发展基金会是一个非赢利性的民间团体，其宗旨是，广泛争取国内外各方面力量支持中国贫困地区的发展，接受有益于中国贫困地区的各方面的援助。这个基金会的成立，改变了过去单纯依靠国家财政拨款和银行贷款扶贫的传统方式，开辟了资金来源和资金使用的新渠道。正在外地调查的国务委员陈俊生在写给基金会的贺信中认为，这是中国扶贫工作在改革开放大背景下的“一个重要的改革和发展”。
    李先念在今天的成立会上说，“各级政府不能因为有了这个基金会就不再向贫困地区拨款。在财政允许的条件下，应该给贫困地区的钱，一分钱也不能扣，扣了就是没有党性，没有群众观念。”他强调说，扶贫资金要用在“发展生产上，绝对不得挪作他用”。会长项南把基金会的工作方针归纳为：“只服务，不赢利，只帮助，不代替。多造血，少输液，多开发，少救济。要脱贫，靠自立，要致富，靠科技”。
    据了解，基金会将开展一系列活动，使国内外社会各界更了解和关心我国贫困地区，成为主要分布在我国中西部地区６００多个贫困县对外开放的一个窗口。宋任穷、王任重、杜润生、童大林、秦川等各界人士到会。
