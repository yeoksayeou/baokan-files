The villagers of Li Village in the western Henan province of Fubushan face difficulties in obtaining salt, but they have not forgotten to support the troops in training.

On December 13, 1988, the supply and marketing cooperative of Li Village brought back 200 kilograms of salt from the county. The news quickly spread throughout the large and small villages, and the villagers, carrying cloth bags and earthen jars, gathered from all directions at the cooperative.

At the same time, a training unit of nearly a thousand people also arrived in Li Village to set up camp. The quartermaster knocked on the door of the village head, Zhao, and said, "Village Head Zhao, can we buy salt here?" It turned out that after several days of forced marches, the unit's supply of salt had run out. At that moment, the villagers were gathered at the cooperative's door, waiting to buy salt. Village Head Zhao went to the crowd and said, "I know everyone is having a hard time getting salt. However, a unit of the People's Liberation Army has come to our village for training, and they have run out of salt. The children of the soldiers are working very hard in their training, and they can't do without salt. I want to discuss with everyone whether we can share some of our salt with the soldiers."

A middle-aged woman said, "In this cold weather, the soldiers are still out training. Sharing some salt with them is no problem." An old man said, "We also have children serving in the army. If our children don't have salt to eat, how would we feel?" Village Head Zhao, standing by, added, "Our fellow villagers love the soldiers so much. Let's share some of our salt with the soldiers!"

"Good!" The villagers picked up their bags of salt and walked towards the soldiers' camp.

　　李村乡村民吃盐虽困难  未忘支援演习的子弟兵
    １９８８年１２月１３日，豫西伏牛山区李村乡供销社从县里拉回２００公斤盐。消息很快传遍了大小村庄，乡亲们拎着布袋，提着瓦罐，从四面八方向乡供销社聚拢。
    与此同时，一支近千人的演习部队也来到李村乡安营扎寨。司务长敲开赵乡长的门，第一句话就是：“赵乡长，这里能买到盐吗？”原来，这支部队经过几天急行军，自带的盐已经用完了。这时，群众正围在供销社门口等着买盐。赵乡长来到人群前说：“大伙吃盐困难，我知道。但是，一支解放军演习部队驻到了咱们乡，他们也没有盐吃了。子弟兵演习训练，十分辛苦，不吃盐怎么行呢。我来和大家商量一下，把盐分给解放军一部分中不中？”
    一位中年大嫂说：“这么冷的天，解放军还在外面演习，盐分给他们一些，咱们没啥说的。”一位老大爷说：“咱们也有娃子在外头当兵，要是娃子没有盐吃，咱心里啥滋味！”站在一旁的赵乡长接过话茬：“乡亲们这么热爱子弟兵，咱们分出一部分盐一块儿给解放军送去！”
    “好！”乡亲们抬起盐包，向部队驻地走去。河南洛阳驻军　王武琦　卢国超
