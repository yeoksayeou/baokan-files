	Jiangxi Prepares to Arrange Suitable Work

	Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, March 2nd: (Reporters Ni Haixi, Du Ba Yi) Former Governor of Jiangxi Province and Vice Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party, Nixiance, has served his two-year sentence and recently been released from prison. He is currently resting at home and unemployed.

	Nixiance was arrested in January 1987 and was sentenced to two years in prison by the Jiangxi Higher People's Court for the crime of abusing power for personal gain after a public trial in May of the same year. Prior to this, he was dismissed from his position as Vice Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee by the Central Committee of the Communist Party; the Jiangxi People's Congress also removed him from his position as Governor.

	Nixiance is 53 years old this year. He served as Governor of Jiangxi Province from June 1985 to October 1986.

	During the public trials at the Nanchang Intermediate People's Court and the Jiangxi Higher People's Court, Nixiance himself did not accept the verdict. His two defense lawyers have been consistently arguing for his innocence. It is reported that Nixiance continues to appeal for his innocence after his release. Jiangxi Provincial relevant departments are preparing to arrange suitable work for him.
