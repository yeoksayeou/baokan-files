Someone said: “A friend is a road, an enemy is a wall.” Li Sufang does not believe this. She said: “The Party has given me a wide road.”

“Scrimping Secretary”

“Scrimping Secretary” Li Sufang is the director of the Shanxi Province Wenxi County Artisan Factory and the only female secretary in the light industry system.

“Scrimping Secretary” is indeed scrimping to the extreme. One day, her family sat together for dinner. Her husband asked, “I heard that the grain coupons in our ration book have been returned?” “Yes.” “How much was the difference?” “153 yuan.” Her husband asked again, “Where is the money?” Li Sufang said, “The factory urgently needs to go to Xi'an to get dyes, but there is no money, so I covered that too.” Her eldest daughter-in-law pouted, “Mom, weren’t you going to buy cloth for your future daughter-in-law? The price of cloth is getting higher and higher.” Her second son got angry, “Mom, when factory workers go out for training, you cover the money; when someone goes on a business trip, you also cover the money; when buying office supplies, you still cover the money; today, … I heard you borrowed over 400 yuan for the factory! Mom, don’t you see what kind of home you are running? The whole family works, but we can’t afford a color TV!”

That night, Li Sufang couldn’t sleep. Thinking it over carefully, she indeed felt guilty towards her children. Other families are building houses, but her family hasn’t moved a brick. It’s not that she can’t get the money. The factory regulations stipulate that for every ton of raw materials obtained, a reward of 1,200 yuan is given. Counting it up, she had obtained 6.5 tons of raw materials, which should amount to 7,800 yuan. But she didn’t take any of it. This was all for the sake of the entire factory working together to turn things around… Taking today’s matter as an example, it was still for the sake of the factory’s poverty. In the past few years, production has improved, and as soon as money is made, it is quickly used to repay the state’s loans. When encountering difficulties, sometimes thirty or fifty yuan can’t be found, so there’s no choice but to borrow. Who wants to do this?

In the factory, there are also people who curse her as a “scrimping ghost.” Li Sufang is neither deaf nor dumb, of course, she knows. But if she doesn’t scrimp, she can’t live with herself. Seeing someone move a blade of grass or a piece of wood from the factory, she feels more aggrieved than if someone were to bully her child, and she will fight with you without hesitation.

Two years ago, the factory introduced a new product. Due to production needs, the water heating system had to be changed to steam heating. The head of the construction team was an acquaintance. When settling the accounts, that person sat casually in the chair opposite her and took out the settlement sheet. Li Sufang took it and looked: 178 man-days of work, at 5.5 yuan per day, totaling 979 yuan. Li Sufang got angry as soon as she saw it: “There can’t be so much!” The team leader said, “Li Secretary, do me a favor and approve it. It’s not like the factory is shortchanging me personally.” Li Sufang said, “But no one should shortchange the factory.” Seeing that he was still trying to persuade her, she immediately called the office director and the person in charge of the workshop. Li Sufang is a shrewd person. She had already arranged for two people to keep track of the work. The three of them checked day by day, and the result was that the total was 105 man-days. Li Sufang saved the factory 401.5 yuan and also blocked a “wall” for herself.

Li Sufang is not someone who treats people differently. Even with the factory’s cadres, she treats them the same way. Once, the factory sent a cadre to buy asbestos tiles. The receipt brought back showed a unit price of 6 yuan, 45 asbestos tiles totaling 270 yuan. The issuing unit was a retail department. Isn’t it said that they bought it from the materials bureau? As soon as this happened, Li Sufang couldn’t sit still for a moment. She rushed to the materials bureau and asked. The materials bureau said there was such a thing, but the unit price was 5.3 yuan. Obviously, this cadre had changed the receipt and made a profit of 31.5 yuan from it. She went straight to that cadre, exposed the bottom of the matter, and finally said one sentence: “I won’t approve this voucher.”

There are many more such incidents that the workers can recount.

Someone said, “Sufang, by doing this, you are making enemies on all sides, aren’t you leaving a way out for yourself?” Li Sufang said, “The people have given me a wide road, I don’t need any other roads.”

### 有人说：“一个朋友一条路，一个冤家一堵墙。”李素芳不信这个，她说：“党给我的路已经很宽了。”  “抠书记”

　　有人说：“一个朋友一条路，一个冤家一堵墙。”李素芳不信这个，她说：        “党给我的路已经很宽了。”
    “抠书记”
    “抠书记”姓李，名素芳，是山西省闻喜县工艺厂的掌舵人，也是二轻系统唯一的女书记。
    “抠书记”抠到了家。一天，她一家人围坐一桌吃晚饭，丈夫问：“听说，咱粮本上的存粮都退了？”“嗯。”“找了多少差价？”“１５３元。”丈夫又问：“钱呢？”李素芳说：“厂里急着到西安拉染料，没有钱，我把那钱也垫上了。”大儿媳一撇嘴，说：“妈，你不是准备给弟弟的未婚妻扯布吗？布价越来越高了。”二儿子动了火气：“妈，厂里职工外出学习，你把钱垫上；有人出差，你也把钱垫上；买办公用品，你还把钱垫上；今天，……听说你还借了４００多块钱给厂里花呢？妈，你就不看看你当的什么家？全家人工作，买不起一台彩电！”
    夜里，李素芳不能入睡。细细想来，确有些愧对儿女。别人家都盖楼房，自己家一砖没动。也不是弄不来钱，厂里规定每搞到一吨原料奖励１２００元。掐指算来，自己前前后后搞回６吨半原料，能得７８００元。但是，她都没要。为的是全厂能上下齐心打翻身仗……拿今天的事来说，还是为的厂里穷，这几年生产好转，挣钱就赶快还国家贷款。遇到事有时三十五十都拿不出，只好借，不借就无法继续生产。谁愿意这样做？
    在厂里，还有人骂她“抠死鬼”。李素芳不聋不傻，当然都知道。但是，不抠，她心里就过不去。看见谁动了厂里的一草一木，比谁欺负她孩子都劲大，她会不顾一切和你干。
    前年，厂里上新产品。因生产需要，要把水暖改成汽暖。工程队的头儿是个熟人，结算时，那人满不在意地坐到对面椅子上，掏出了结算单。李素芳接过来一看：投工１７８个，按每个工５．５元计，合计９７９元。李素芳一看就冒了火：“没有这么多！”工头说：“李书记，行行好，你批了就算事呐。拿一个厂还亏我私人吗？”李素芳说：“可是谁也别想亏厂里。”李素芳见他还要软磨下去，就马上把办公室主任与车间的负责人都叫了来。李素芳是个精明人，她早安排下两个人记着工呢。三个人锣对锣，鼓对鼓地逐天核对，结果，满打满算１０５个工。李素芳为厂里“抠”得４０１．５元，也为自己堵了一道“墙”。
    李素芳可不是看人下菜的人。就是对厂里干部，她也一样认理不认人。有一次，厂里派一个干部去买石棉瓦，拿回来的发票是单价６元，４５块石棉瓦共计２７０元。开票单位是一个门市部。不是说到物资局买吗？一遇这事，李素芳就一刻也坐不住了，跑到物资局一问，物资局说有这回事，可单价是５．３元。显然，这个干部换了发票，从中取利３１．５元。她径直找到那个干部，揭了事情的底儿，最后说了一句话：“这个条子我不批。”
    这类事情，工人们还会给你举出许许多多。
    有人说：“素芳，你这样四面树敌，就不给自己留条路吗？”李素芳说：“人民给我的路就很宽，我不需要别的路。”
