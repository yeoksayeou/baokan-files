A major sand gold mine has been discovered in the Zaduo County of Qinghai Province's Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. It is reported that this is the largest sand gold mine currently found within Qinghai Province.

The large deposit, named "Zaduo Sand Gold Mine," was discovered by the Fourth Geological Team of the Qinghai Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. After more than three years of surveying, the area and thickness of the mine have been basically determined, with an average grade of 0.466 grams per cubic meter. The exploration results indicate that the mining conditions here are also relatively good.
