China's march towards modernization has encountered numerous challenges. When people find themselves helpless in the face of issues like uncontrolled population growth, environmental pollution, energy waste, traffic chaos, and poor quality products, and when they encounter obstacles in economic reforms and democratic progress, they unanimously realize that one of the root causes is the low quality of our people. To improve the quality of our people, we must rely on education. Education urgently needs reform, and education faces new choices. On February 11th and March 3rd, the Chinese Association for Science and Technology organized two "Science and Culture Forums" to discuss educational issues. Below are some of the views expressed by participants.

Education should fully utilize high-tech means
Qián Xuésēn (President of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology):

We are facing the 21st century, and our educational methods need a major overhaul. We should research and fully utilize high-tech means such as satellite communications, broadcasting, information technology and data processing based on electronic computers, and electronic dictionaries and encyclopedias. We need to break down the barriers between the education sector and other state departments, allowing all knowledgeable and experienced individuals to pass on their knowledge and experience. The State Education Commission should become a genuine authority overseeing the entire country's education, strengthening macro-management and further decentralizing school operations.

Limited funds should be prioritized for education
Qián Sānqiáng (Vice President of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology):

"Everything depends on people." Fundamentally, the development of science and technology, the revitalization of the economy, and the overall progress of society all depend on improving the quality of the workforce and cultivating a large number of qualified talents. Therefore, we must prioritize the development of education, shifting economic construction to rely on technological progress and improving the quality of the workforce. In the current situation, using our limited funds primarily for education may seem to affect the speed of economic construction, but in reality, only by cultivating people can economic construction truly succeed. The development speed will actually be faster, and there is a dialectical relationship of mutual promotion between the two.

The key to getting out of the predicament is solving the teacher problem
Tóng Dàlín (Director of the State Economic System Reform Research Institute):

Some comrades say that our country is facing an "educational crisis." I believe this description is not accurate. A crisis is cyclical, typically involving stages of crisis, recession, recovery, and boom. Currently, China's educational situation does not exhibit these stages but has been in a prolonged predicament. How do we get out of this predicament? I believe the focus is on the teacher problem. Our country has approximately 10 million primary and secondary school teachers who teach over 200 million students and are connected to every household. These 10 million teachers make up about half of the country's intellectuals. If we do not solve their problems, we will not be able to solve the problems of intellectuals.

Correctly assess the educational objects
Wú Míngyù (Deputy Director of the State Council's Economic, Technological, and Social Development Research Center):

The object of education is the students. How we view today's students is crucial to the success of education. A few years ago, some people made erroneous assessments, claiming that only a minority of students adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, while the majority are wavering. This assessment pushed most of our 228 million young people to the other side. Is this assessment not similar to the extreme leftist ideology that pushed the vast majority of intellectuals to the side of the bourgeoisie? Based on this starting point, some places in their ideological and political education of students have more "control, restriction, and pressure" than enlightenment and guidance. Some comrades even fear students. I believe this erroneous view does not reflect the facts. Without a resolve to reform ideological and political education, merely talking about strengthening "moral education" will not yield good results.

Economic, legal, and cultural means
Yú Guāngyuǎn (Member of the Central Advisory Commission):

In carrying out various reforms, in addition to administrative measures, we must also use economic, legal, and cultural means. Increasing educational funds is an economic measure, and now we are pushing for educational legislation, which is the use of legal means. The discussions we are currently having about education are cultural means. However, in relevant documents, I believe the use of cultural means is still insufficient. Now we should vigorously promote the study and discussion of educational guiding ideologies to raise the level of China's educational guiding ideologies.

The function of education is to improve the quality of the entire nation
Dīng Shíshēn (President of Peking University):

What is the function and purpose of education? We have already criticized "education serving class struggle," and now some people simply propose "education serving economic construction." I believe this is also one-sided. This proposition easily leads to short-term behavior and also greatly limits the knowledge structure of the people being cultivated. I believe that the true function of education is to improve the quality of the entire nation. Then, what is the quality of a person? First, they should know how to get along with others; second, they should have common sense; third, they should know how to think, how to ask questions, and how to solve problems.

We need quantity, but more importantly, quality
Xǔ Jiālù (Vice President of Beijing Normal University):

Regarding education, there are currently two views: the crisis theory and the optimistic view. Those who say "the situation is good" base their argument on the fact that before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, we had only over 500 higher education institutions, and now we have increased to 1,075, with the number of students doubling. In fact, from a global perspective, how many of our 1,000-plus higher education institutions are qualified? Especially our primary and secondary school teachers, how many are qualified? The crisis in China's education is not just about students dropping out and teachers leaving, but also about the disinterest in education and the decline in the quality of relevant personnel, including some government officials.

Basic education should be combined with vocational and technical education
Hǎo Kèmíng (Director of the State Education Commission's Development Research Center):

Currently, a prominent issue in China's educational development is that the strategic position of education in economic and social development, as proposed by the 13th Party Congress, has not been well implemented in actual work. Currently, about 6 million primary school graduates cannot advance to junior high school, 6 million junior high school graduates cannot advance to senior high school, and nearly 2 million senior high school graduates cannot advance to university. A significant portion of these people enter society with a sense of failure and without vocational training, which is a big problem. Therefore, I strongly support placing the improvement of the workforce's quality and the cultivation of intermediate-level talents in a prominent position in China's educational development strategy by 2000, combining the development of basic education with vocational and technical education, and meeting the high-quality needs of socialist construction for high-level specialized talents.

Schools should maintain moral and academic purity
Táo Shìlóng (Professor at China University of Geosciences):

In my opinion, the guiding ideology of educational reform currently needs to address the issue of impatience and short-term gains. I hope that during this transition from the old to the new system, schools can still maintain moral and academic purity, becoming a clean land that can cultivate the backbone of China. The strategic goal of educational reform should be to improve the quality of the entire nation. The root cause of the various problems that have emerged lies in this. Those who truly think of future generations and the interests of the nation will be willing to invest in education. The ancient adage "Establishing the country and educating the people, teaching comes first" is a summary of historical experience and should not be forgotten.

Four dangerous signals in the current educational problems
Dèng Shòupéng (Researcher at the State Council's Economic, Technological, and Social Development Research Center):

Currently, the global discussion on the reconstruction of the educational system is particularly challenging for us. China's education currently faces four dangerous signals that must be fully recognized by society. Signal 1: The enrollment rate of adolescents is seriously low, resulting in a generation of adolescents who have received insufficient education. According to age groups suitable for enrollment, China's junior high school enrollment rate is 39%, roughly half that of some developing countries and one-third that of developed countries; China's enrollment rate in higher education is 2%, roughly one-fifth that of some developing countries and one-twentieth that of developed countries. Signal 2: Shortages in educational funds have induced various non-standard commercial behaviors, worsening the external relations of education. Signal 3: Outdated educational concepts, backward management systems, and low teaching quality have led to a decline in overall educational effectiveness. Signal 4: Weak ideological education, with fading awareness of laws, morality, discipline, and civilization, has led to a trend of declining social morals.

The new "uselessness of reading" is an internal injury
Xú Guāngxiān (Professor at Peking University):

Peking University is considered the pinnacle of higher education, but the situation here is also concerning. In terms of educational funds, although operational funds have been increasing year by year, the deficit has also been increasing year by year. Not only are teachers' salaries and benefits low, but housing is also extremely tight. Those who get married at 30 cannot get housing. According to the current housing allocation standards at Peking University, one generally has to wait until they are 36 years old to get a house, so now there are many cases of "cohabiting in the same place but separate households." Some young teachers appeal, "We need living space." The past "uselessness of reading" was an external injury, but the new "uselessness of reading" is an internal injury. Now, many graduate students no longer want to pursue master's or doctoral degrees but are looking for ways to study abroad and make money. I have 9 doctoral students, 3 of whom have dropped out, and another 3 are wavering.

First, education should teach people how to be human
Xià Xuézhī (Principal of Peking University Affiliated Middle School):

Education should first teach people how to be human. Due to the lack of attention to education and mistakes in education, many young people today do not know how to be human. A few years ago, Beijing's streets were filled with so many new phone booths, but now they have been destroyed to the point of almost nonexistence. It is said that Guangzhou is the same. This is a manifestation of low national quality.

　　中国教育面临新的抉择
    ——科技文教界知名人士的议论
    本报记者  王溪元
    中国走向现代化，遇到了种种难题。当人们在人口失控、环境污染、能源浪费、交通混乱、质量低劣等困扰面前束手无策，当人们在经济改革和民主进程中碰到种种障碍之时，不约而同地发现，我们问题的症结之一是人的素质太差，而要提高人的素质，唯有靠教育。教育急需改革，教育面临新的抉择。２月１１日和３月３日，中国科协接连组织“科学与文化论坛”讨论教育问题。这里刊登的是部分与会者的见解。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    　　　　教育要充分运用高技术手段钱学森（中国科协主席）：
    我们面临２１世纪，教育方法要有大的改革，要研究和充分运用高技术手段，如卫星通信广播、以电子计算机为基础的信息技术和数据处理、电子化字典及词书等；我们要打破教育部门与国家其它部门的分割，使所有有知识、有经验的人都能够传授其知识和经验；国家教委要成为真正统管全国教育的机构，加强宏观管理，进一步放活学校。
    　　　　有限的资金应先用来办教育钱三强（中国科协副主席）：
    “事在人为”。从根本上讲，科技的发展，经济的振兴，乃至整个社会的进步，都取决于劳动者素质的提高和大量合格人才的培养。因此，要把发展教育事业放在战略的首要位置，使经济建设转到依靠科技进步和提高劳动者素质的轨道上来。在目前情况下，把我国有限的资金首先用来办教育，表面上看好象会影响经济建设的速度，实际上只有把人培养出来，经济建设才能真正搞好，发展速度反而更快，两者间有一个互相促进的辩证关系。
    　　　　走出困境的关键是解决教师问题童大林（国家体制改革研究会理事长）：
    有的同志说我们国家存在“教育危机”，我认为这样说不够确切。危机是有周期的，通常要经历危机、萧条、复苏、高涨等几个阶段。目前中国教育的情况并没有这些阶段的特征，而是长期陷入困境。如何走出困境？我认为焦点是教师问题。我国大中小学教师约有１０００多万，他们教２亿多学生，联系着家家户户。这１０００多万教师，约占全国知识分子的一半，如果不把他们的问题解决，知识分子问题就解决不了。
    　　　　正确估计教育对象吴明瑜（国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心副总干事长）：
    教育的对象是学生，怎样看待今天的学生，关系教育的成败。几年前就有人作出过这样的错误估计，认为学生中坚持四项基本原则的是少数，大多数是动摇的。这种估计是把我们２．２８亿的子弟的大多数推向另一边去了。这种估计同当年把广大知识分子推到资产阶级一边去的极左思潮是否异曲同工？正是基于这样一个出发点，有些地方在对学生的思想政治教育中，“管、卡、压”多于启发引导，少数同志甚至害怕学生。我认为这种错误的观点不符合事实。不下决心改造思想政治教育，空讲加强“德育”，就不会产生很好的效果。
    　　　　经济手段、法律手段再加文化手段于光远（中央顾问委员会委员）：
    我们搞各项改革，除运用行政手段外，还要用经济手段、法律手段和文化手段。增加教育经费是经济手段，现在要搞教育立法就是运用法律手段。我们现在所进行的关于教育的讨论就是文化手段，不过在有关文件中关于文化手段的运用，我认为讲得还很不够。现在应当大力开展一下教育指导思想的研究和讨论，提高我国教育指导思想的水平。
    　　　　教育的功能是提高全民族素质丁石孙（北京大学校长）：
    教育的功能、目的究竟是什么？我们已经批判了“教育为阶级斗争服务”，现在又有人简单地提“教育为经济建设服务”。我认为这也是片面的。这种提法容易造成短期行为，而且对所培养的人的知识结构也会造成很大的局限。我认为，教育的真正功能是提高全民族的人的素质。那么，什么是人的素质？首先，他应该会与人相处；其次，他们应有生活常识；第三，他们要懂得如何思考问题，如何提出问题、解决问题。
    　　　　要数量，更重要的是质量许嘉璐（北京师范大学副校长）：
    对于教育，现在有两种论调，一个是危机论，一个是形势大好论。说“形势大好”的人的根据之一是：党的十一届三中全会以前，我们只有５００多所高等院校，现在已增至１０７５所，在校生翻了两番。其实，从世界范围来看，我们这１０００多所高等院校，有多少是合格的？特别是我们的中小学教师，有多少是合格的？我国教育形势的危机不仅在于学生辍学、教师流失，更在于一谈教育就厌烦，在于包括一些政府官员在内的有关人员素质的下降。
    　　　　基础教育应与职业技术教育结合郝克明（国家教委发展研究中心主任）：
    目前我国教育发展中一个突出的问题是党的十三大提出的教育在经济和社会发展中的首要战略地位，还没有很好地在实际工作中真正落实。我国现在每年约有６００万小学毕业生不能升入初中，有６００万初中毕业生不能升入高中，有将近２００万高中毕业生不能升入大学。他们中相当多的一部分人是以失败者的精神状态进入社会的，又没有进行事业技能的培训，这是一个很大的问题。因此我很赞成在我国至２０００年的教育发展战略中把提高劳动者的素质和培养初中级人才放在突出位置，并把发展基础教育和发展职业技术教育结合起来，同时高质量地满足社会主义建设对高级专门人才的需要。
    　　　　学校要保持道德和学术的圣洁陶世龙（中国地质大学教授）：
    教育改革的指导思想，照我看，当前最需要解决的，是对待改革急于求成，急功近利的思想问题。希望在这新旧体制转换之际，学校还能保持道德和学术的圣洁，成为一块不被污染的、能培育出中国的脊梁的净土。教育改革的战略目标，应在于提高整个民族的素质，眼下出现的种种问题，从根本上说就在于此。真正能想到子孙后代、想到民族利益，必定舍得在教育上花钱。“建国君民，教学为先”这个古训，是历史经验的概括，不可忘却。
    　　　　教育问题严重的四个危险信号邓寿鹏（国务院经济技术社会发展研究中心研究员）：
    当前全球都在讨论教育体系的重建，这种挑战对我国来说特别严峻。我国教育目前存在４个危险信号，必须引起全社会的充分注意。信号１，在学的青少年入学比例严重偏低，总体上造成了接受教育不足的青少年一代。按适合入学的年龄来分组统计，我国的中学入学人数比例是３９％，大约只有某些发展中国家的１／２，发达国家的１／３；我国的高等学校入学人数比例是２％，大约只有某些发展中国家的１／５，发达国家的１／２０。信号２，教育经费短缺，诱发出若干非规范的商业行为，使教育的外部关系恶化。信号３，教育观念陈旧，管理体制落后，教学质量不高，导致整个教育效益下降。信号４，思想教育薄弱，法制、道德、纪律、文明意识淡化，全社会出现“世风日下”的趋向。
    　　　　新的“读书无用论”是内伤徐光宪（北京大学教授）：
    北京大学堪称高校的重点的重点，但这里的情况也同样令人担心。从教育经费来看，事业费虽然逐年有所增加，但赤字也是逐年增加。不仅老师们的工资待遇不高，住房更是紧张。３０岁结婚分不到住房。按现在北大的分房标准，一般要到３６岁才能分到房子，所以现在又出现了许多“同地分居”的现象。有些青年教师呼吁：“我们需要生存的空间。”过去的“读书无用论”是外伤，现在新的“读书无用论”是内伤。现在许多研究生都不想再争什么硕士、博士了，而是想法留洋、挣钱。我带了９个博士研究生，有３个退学了，还有３个正在动摇。
    　　　　首先要教育人学会做人夏学之（北大附中校长）：
    教育首先要教育人学会做人。由于教育不被重视和教育上的失误，现在有不少青少年不懂得做人。前几年北京街头建起了那么多崭新的电话亭，现在已经被破坏得所剩无几，听说广州也是如此。这是国民素质低下的表现。
