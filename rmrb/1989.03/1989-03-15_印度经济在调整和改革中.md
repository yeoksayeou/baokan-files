Since 1980, India has been implementing economic adjustments and reforms. Over the past nine years, the country's GDP growth rate has averaged 5% annually, significantly surpassing the 3.5% average of the previous 30 years. In 1988, the growth rate reached 8.4%. Apart from favorable weather conditions, this achievement largely reflects the success of India's economic adjustments and reforms.

The main content of India's economic adjustments and reforms includes:

1. **Shift in Economic Development Strategy**: From prioritizing heavy industry to a balanced development of agriculture, light, and heavy industries. The Indian government, recognizing that 75% of the population is engaged in agriculture and that agriculture contributes nearly 40% to the GDP, has prioritized agricultural development and increased investment in this sector. During the fifth, sixth, and seventh five-year plans, agricultural investment accounted for 21.9%, 25%, and 21.8% of the total national investment, respectively. Irrigated land covers 40% of the total cultivated area. The use of fertilizers and agricultural credit has also significantly increased. These measures have enhanced agriculture's resilience to natural disasters. Despite three consecutive years of drought, which led to reduced grain production, the country did not experience a major famine.

The focus of industrial development has shifted from steel and heavy machinery to energy, electronics, textiles, and fertilizers. Energy investment has increased annually. In the 1986-1987 fiscal year, oil production reached 30.48 million tons, coal production was 165.8 million tons, and electricity generation was 18.76 billion kWh. The problem of energy shortages has significantly improved.

Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi emphasized the need to "use new technology to bring India into the 21st century." A "revolutionary" measure is to advance the electronics industry to the level of developed countries. In recent years, India's electronics industry has grown at an average annual rate of 40%, with computers growing by 50%. To promote the export of computer software, the government has issued a series of measures.

2. **Economic System Reforms**: From emphasizing state-owned enterprises to encouraging more private enterprise. The share of private investment in total investment has increased from 45% during the fifth five-year plan to 47% during the sixth five-year plan, and reached 52% during the seventh five-year plan, surpassing the public sector. At the same time, competitive mechanisms are being introduced into state-owned enterprises to improve efficiency. The "Memorandum of Understanding" signed last year between the government and enterprises has given enterprises more autonomy. Some state-owned enterprises are also experimenting with employee ownership and participation in management.

3. **Strengthening Macroeconomic Management**: Implementing a deficit fiscal policy while controlling inflation. Since 1980, due to the expansion of non-development expenditures, increased grants to states, and reduced central tax revenue sharing, India's fiscal deficit has surged. During the seventh five-year plan, the projected fiscal deficit is 140 billion rupees, but in the first four years, the deficit has already reached 314.8 billion rupees. To prevent excessive fiscal deficits from causing inflation, India has taken a series of measures: controlling the money supply, strengthening credit regulation, and ensuring that the growth rate of the money supply does not exceed the growth rate of national income. Second, implementing a supply-oriented price strategy to maintain basic price stability. Dual pricing is applied to essential goods and important industrial raw materials. Third, selectively controlling investment scales, mainly controlling investments that lead to wage increases and commodity supply shortages. From the 1981-1982 fiscal year to the 1985-1986 fiscal year, India's inflation rate averaged 6.8%. In the 1987-1988 fiscal year, despite a severe drought, the inflation rate was only 10.4%.

4. **Accelerating Opening Up**: India has utilized economic aid from various countries and international organizations as the main channel for obtaining foreign funds and technology. In the past four years, the aid provided by the aid consortium to India has totaled $16.2 billion. In 1985, Rajiv Gandhi's visit to the Soviet Union and Gorbachev's visit to India in 1986 resulted in India receiving $3.45 billion in economic aid from the Soviet Union, more than double the total aid received from the Soviet Union in the past 30 years. In terms of foreign trade, India has also made efforts to promote exports to address the severe trade deficit caused by long-term import substitution. However, due to the low efficiency of Indian enterprises, it is currently difficult to adapt to the increasingly fierce international competition, and the export situation is still not ideal.

India's economic adjustments and reforms have been effective, but they also face some challenges, notably the worsening fiscal situation and political opposition from some vested interests. This has affected the speed of India's economic reforms, but the direction of the reforms will not be reversed.

　　印度经济在调整和改革中
    华碧云
    印度自１９８０年实施经济调整、改革以来，９年中国民生产总值增长率年均达５％，大大超过了前３０年平均３．５％的水平，１９８８年高达８．４％。除了风调雨顺的因素，这在很大程度上反映了印度经济调整和改革的成就。
    印度经济调整和改革的主要内容是：
    一、经济发展战略由片面优先发展重工业转向农轻重协调发展。印度政府从农业人口占全国人口７５％、农业产值占国民生产总值近４０％这一基本国情出发，首先确立农业的优先地位，增加农业投资。在第五、六、七三个五年计划期间，农业投资分别占国家投资总额的２１．９％、２５％和２１．８％。灌溉面积占全国耕地面积的４０％。化肥施用量和农业信贷也都大幅度增加。这些措施增强了农业抵御自然灾害的能力。尽管连续３年的干旱使印度的粮食减产，但全国没有发生大的饥荒。
    工业发展重点由钢铁、重型机械转向能源、电子、纺织和化肥等部门。能源投资逐年增加，１９８６—１９８７年度石油产量达３０４８万吨，煤炭产量为１．６５８亿吨，电力达１８７６亿度。能源短缺现象已明显改善。
    拉·甘地总理强调“要用新科技把印度带入２１世纪”。一项“革命性”的措施就是使电子工业赶上先进国家。近几年印度的电子工业年平均增长率为４０％，其中计算机增长达５０％。为促进计算机软件的出口，政府颁布了一系列措施。
    二、在经济体制上从过去强化国营经济转向更多鼓励私营企业。私营投资在全部投资中所占的比重已由“五五”计划期间的４５％上升到“六五”计划期间的４７％，在“七五”计划期间达到５２％，超过了公营部门。同时在国营企业引进竞争机制以提高效益。去年通过的政府与企业《谅解备忘录》给企业以更大的自主权。一些国营企业也正在试行职工入股和参加管理。
    三、加强对经济的宏观管理，在实行赤字财政政策的同时控制通货膨胀。１９８０年以来由于非发展开支扩大、对邦的拨款增加和中央税收分成下降，印度政府的财政赤字激增。“七五”计划期间预计财政赤字总额达１４００亿卢比，而头四年赤字已达３１４８亿卢比。为了避免财政赤字过大引起通货膨胀，印度采取了一系列的措施：一是控制货币投放量，加强信贷调节，注意货币供应量的增长速度不过多地超过国民收入增长率。二是制定面向供应的物价战略以保持物价基本稳定。对生活必需品和重要工业原料实行双重价格。三是有选择地控制投资规模，主要控制会导致工资上升、商品供应紧张的投资。１９８１—１９８２年度至１９８５—１９８６年度，印度的通货膨胀率平均为６．８％，１９８７—１９８８年度发生严重旱灾，通货膨胀率也只有１０．４％。
    四、加速对外开放。印度把利用各国官方和国际机构的经济援助作为利用外国资金和技术的主要渠道。近４年中援印财团对印度的援助共计１６２亿美元。１９８５年拉·甘地访问苏联和１９８６年戈尔巴乔夫访问印度，印度从苏联获得３４．５亿美元的经济援助，超过过去３０年中苏联对印度经援总和一倍。在对外贸易方面，印度还努力促进出口以改变长期实行进口替代所造成的严重逆差状况，但是由于印度企业的效率较低一时还难以适应日趋激烈的国际竞争，目前出口状况还很不理想。
    印度的经济调整改革是有成效的，但也面临一些困难，突出的是财政状况日益恶化，此外政治上也受到部分既得利益者的反对。这使印度经济改革的速度受到影响，但是印度改革的方向是不会逆转的。
