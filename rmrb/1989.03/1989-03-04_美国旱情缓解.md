	The drought in the United States has eased. According to the latest report from U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorological experts, there have been significant climate changes in North America this year. Since the onset of winter, the northern Great Plains, Northwest, and Midwest regions of the United States have received heavy snowfall, improving soil moisture conditions.

	Although the western wheat-producing regions are still experiencing drought, the overall drought situation in the country has improved, and it is unlikely that there will be a severe drought like last year. Agriculture is expected to recover, and agricultural exports are likely to expand. The Department of Agriculture predicts that the export volume for the 1989 fiscal year could reach $36.5 billion, the highest level since 1984.
