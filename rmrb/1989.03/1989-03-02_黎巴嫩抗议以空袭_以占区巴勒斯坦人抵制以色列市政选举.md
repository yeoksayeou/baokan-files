Lebanon Protests Israeli Airstrikes

	The acting Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lebanon, Hus, today strongly protested against Israel's airstrikes on the southern mountainous region of Beirut.

	Hus made this protest in an urgent letter to Lebanon's permanent representative to the United Nations, Rashid Fahouri. He requested Fahouri to appeal to the United Nations Security Council to convene a meeting to discuss the issue of Israel's airstrikes on Lebanon.

	Starting at 11:28 AM on the 28th, Israeli military aircraft conducted three strikes over a 15-minute period on three targets in the southern mountainous region of Beirut, firing three heavy rockets. This attack disrupted air traffic at Beirut Airport.

	This attack is the third time this year that Israel has launched an attack on Lebanese territory. On January 11th and 12th, Israel had previously attacked the "Fatah" Revolutionary Committee camp and the area east of Sidon in southern Lebanon.

Palestinians in Occupied Territories Boycott Israeli Municipal Elections

	Palestinian residents in the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip held a general strike today to boycott municipal elections held in Israel and East Jerusalem.

	According to reports from the occupied territories, out of more than 70,000 Arab voters in East Jerusalem, only 9 people cast their votes.

	In response to the call for a strike issued by the uprising leadership committee on the 27th, shops were closed and transportation was paralyzed in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip today.

	The Israeli army has been blocking roads leading from the occupied territories to Israel since the 27th. The Israeli army clashed with local residents in the West Bank, resulting in the death of one Palestinian youth, at least 15 injuries, and the arrest of hundreds of people.

    以占区巴勒斯坦人抵制以色列市政选举
    新华社贝鲁特2月28日电　黎巴嫩代总理兼外交部长胡斯今天对以色列空袭贝鲁特南部山区提出强烈抗议。
    胡斯是在给黎巴嫩常驻联合国代表拉希德·法胡里的一封紧急信中提出这一抗议的。他要求法胡里呼吁联合国安理会召开会议讨论以色列空袭黎巴嫩问题。
    以色列军用飞机从28日11点28分开始，15分钟内对贝鲁特南部山区进行了3次袭击，向3个目标发射了3枚重型火箭。这次袭击使贝鲁特机场的空中交通受阻。
    这次袭击是今年以来以色列对黎巴嫩领土发动的第三次袭击。今年1月11日和12日，以色列曾分别袭击了“法塔赫”革命委员会营地和南黎巴嫩赛达港以东地区。
    新华社开罗2月28日电　被占领土约旦河西岸和加沙地带的巴勒斯坦居民今天举行总罢工，抵制在以色列和东耶路撒冷进行的市政选举。
    据来自被占领土的报道，东耶路撒冷7万多阿拉伯选民中，只有9人投了票。
    为了响应起义领导委员会27日发出的罢工号召，东耶路撒冷、约旦河西岸和加沙地带今天商店关门，交通运输停顿瘫痪。
    以色列军队从27日起封锁了被占领土通向以色列的道路。以色列军队在西岸同当地居民发生冲突，一名巴勒斯坦青年被打死，至少15人受伤，并有数百人被捕。
