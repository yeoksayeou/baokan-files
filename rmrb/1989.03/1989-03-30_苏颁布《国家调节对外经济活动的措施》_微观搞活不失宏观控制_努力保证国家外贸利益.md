Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 28th.

Starting from April 1st this year, all enterprises and production cooperatives in the Soviet Union will be able to independently engage in import and export activities. While granting more autonomy to local units, the Soviet government is also taking steps to ensure national interests in foreign trade, aiming to activate the micro-level while maintaining macro-control.

The Soviet Council of Ministers recently issued the "Measures for State Regulation of Foreign Economic Activities." The Soviet Union will strengthen macro-control over foreign trade through four aspects: registering foreign trade entities, issuing permits for the import and export of goods, controlling the import and export of key commodities, and regulating import and export activities.

In the course of economic reform, the Soviet Union expanded the foreign trade rights of local units last year. However, this led to various issues such as excessive competition in exports and blind imports. Different regions had significant price differences for the same goods, with some regions exporting certain goods to a country while neighboring regions imported the same goods at higher prices from the same country.

According to the new regulations, all units engaging in foreign economic activities must register with the Soviet Union's Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations for supervision.

Units handling the import and export of goods must submit customs declarations to customs as proof of goods clearance, which will also serve as original data for foreign economic activity statistics and the basis for tax collection.

The foreign trade of 20 key commodities such as fuels, metals, and food, which are crucial to the national economy and people's livelihoods, will be managed by specialized foreign trade organizations. Other units engaging in the import and export of these commodities must obtain approval from the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations or the relevant authorities responsible for balancing supply and demand in the domestic market. Some commodities are authorized to be approved by the Council of Ministers of the Union Republics.

Last year, the Soviet Union's export volume decreased by 1.9%, while the import volume increased by 6.5%. The diversification of import and export channels will make it more difficult to balance foreign trade, so effective means of regulating import and export activities are essential. The Soviet Union will set quotas and issue permits for imports and exports to reasonably allocate the share of a commodity in the domestic market and the foreign trade market. If foreign countries take discriminatory measures, the Soviet Union can also take corresponding actions.

Some cooperatives in the Soviet Union engage in intermediary resale activities, exploiting the price differences between domestic and foreign markets to gain huge profits, causing losses to the state. The new regulations stipulate that production cooperatives and joint ventures can only export their own produced goods or import goods for their own use. Engaging in intermediary resale activities requires approval from the Soviet Union's Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.

### 苏颁布《国家调节对外经济活动的措施》  微观搞活不失宏观控制  努力保证国家外贸利益

　　苏颁布《国家调节对外经济活动的措施》        
    微观搞活不失宏观控制        
    努力保证国家外贸利益
    新华社莫斯科３月２８日电  （记者盛世良）从今年４月１日起，苏联所有企业和生产合作社都可独立从事进出口业务。苏联政府在放权给基层的同时努力保证国家外贸利益，以求在微观搞活的同时又不失宏观控制。
    苏联部长会议最近颁布《国家调节对外经济活动的措施》，苏联将从登记外贸单位、发放货物出入境许可证、控制重要商品进出口、调节进出口业务四个方面入手，加强对外贸的宏观控制。
    苏联在经济改革中于去年扩大了基层单位的外贸权，但随即在不同程度上出现了一拥而上、争相出口和盲目进口的现象。不同地区进出口的同一种商品差价几成到几倍，有的地区向某国出口某种商品，而邻近地区却高价从该国购进同一种商品。
    按照新的规定，今后凡从事对外经贸活动的单位要在苏联对外经济联络部登记注册，以便于国家监督。
    进出口货物的收发单位须向海关呈送报关单，作为货物过关凭据，并作为国家外经活动统计的原始资料和征收关税的依据。
    燃料、金属和食品等２０种关系到国计民生的重要商品的外贸，由专门外贸机构经营，其他单位从事这些商品的进出口，须经外经部或负责该项商品在国内市场供求平衡的机关的批准，其中有几种商品授权加盟共和国部长会议批准。
    去年苏联外贸出口额减少１．９％，进口额增长６．５％。多渠道进出口将使外贸更难平衡，因此行之有效的进出口业务调节手段必不可少。苏联将对进出口规定限额，发放许可证，以合理分配某一商品在国内市场和外贸市场之间的份额，一旦外国采取歧视措施，苏也可采取对应行动。
    苏联有的合作社从事居间转卖活动，利用内外市场的差价获取巨额利润，国家蒙受损失。现在规定生产合作社和合资企业只能出口自己生产的商品或进口自用产品，从事居间转卖活动须经苏联外经部许可。
