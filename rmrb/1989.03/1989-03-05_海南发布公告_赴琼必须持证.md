The Hainan Provincial Government today issued a "Notice on Strengthening the Management of Personnel Entering Hainan Economic Zone." It stipulates that before the issuance of the "Hainan Economic Zone Pass," anyone entering Hainan Province must carry their resident ID card, work certificate, or a valid introduction letter and proof issued and stamped by a county-level or higher unit.

Authorities here stated that this measure aims to control the unregulated influx of people. Those coming to Hainan to invest, start businesses, or sell products are still welcome, and the policy remains unchanged.

Since the Spring Festival, there has been an uncontrolled influx of people from inland areas into Hainan. In just half a month, nearly 200,000 people have entered the island via the new port in Haikou. Starting from March 1, more than 10,000 people have been arriving daily. The current trend shows a continuing increase. The large influx of unregulated migrants has put significant pressure on local social order, traffic management, and supply of goods.

Recently, the Hainan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Government held a joint meeting and decided to issue a notice on strengthening the management of personnel entering the Hainan Economic Zone. For those who have already entered Hainan, they must leave within a specified period. Those who do not leave within the specified period will be taken in and sent back by the civil affairs department.

　　海南发布公告
    赴琼必须持证
    本报海口３月４日电  记者罗自苏报道：海南省政府今天发出《关于加强对进入海南经济特区人员管理的公告》，规定在颁发“海南经济特区通行证”之前，凡进入海南省的人员必须持本人的居民身份证、工作证或县以上单位出具和签章的有效证明和介绍信。
    此间权威人士表示：此举旨在控制人员盲目流入，对来海南投资办企业、经商、推销产品者，仍然欢迎、政策不变。
    今年春节后，内地人员盲目流入海南，短短半月内从海口新港入岛的已近２０万人，３月１日起每天上岸的超过１万。目前尚有持续增加的势头。盲流人员大量涌入给当地社会治安、以及交通管理、物资供应造成很大压力。
    日前，中共海南省委、省府召开联席会议决定：除颁发加强对进入海南经济特区人员管理的公告外，对已进入海南的盲流人员必须限期离开，逾期不离者，由民政部门收容遣送。
