The Ministry of International Trade and Industry of Japan decided on February 15 to implement a product liability system for companies. Under this system, consumers can demand strict compensation from companies if they suffer damages due to product defects.

The product liability system stipulates that if consumers suffer damages due to product defects, companies must compensate them, regardless of whether the defects were due to the company's negligence or not. "Defects not caused by negligence" sometimes occur due to limitations in production technology at the time, which were unforeseen. This is a strict system that holds companies responsible for defects not caused by negligence. In the United States, such a system has been legalized for over 20 years. Within the European Community, which is moving towards a unified market, Britain, Greece, and Italy have already implemented relevant regulations, and the remaining member countries will also implement them in the near future.

In the United States, there was a case where a husband sued a tobacco company, claiming that his wife's death from lung cancer was the company's fault. The husband won the case. In similar lawsuits where consumers suffer damages due to product accidents and demand compensation, there have been numerous instances where consumers have won.

　　产品责任制在日本
    产品质量不好　企业必须赔偿
    日本通产省２月１５日决定对企业实行产品责任制方针。根据这个制度，消费者因产品缺陷受到损害时，可以严厉要求企业方面负责赔偿。
    产品责任制规定，消费者因产品缺陷蒙受损害时，如属企业方面的过失，自不待言，即便不是，企业也必须负责赔偿。“非过失所致缺陷”，有时是因为受当时生产技术的局限，始料未及所造成的。这是一个追究企业非过失责任的严厉的制度，在美国，２０多年前就已经法制化。在将要实现统一市场的欧共体内，英国、希腊和意大利３国也已实施有关法规，其余成员国也将在近期内实施。
    在美国，曾有一位丈夫向法庭上诉说：“妻子患肺癌死去，是香烟厂的责任”。结果他胜诉了。像这类因产品事故蒙受损害而要求赔偿的诉讼中，消费者胜诉的例子不断增多。
