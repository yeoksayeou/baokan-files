	Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow
	——Feng Yuzhong Representative Discusses the Relationship Between Reform and Rectification
	Reporter: Mo Xinyuan
	(National People's Congress Representative, President of Liaoning University, and known as a "practical economist," Feng Yuzhong recently accepted an interview with the reporter.)

	Reporter: The deliberation of the government work report has been going on for a week. What are your thoughts?

	Feng Yuzhong: My overall feeling is that we have analyzed the causes of inflation more superficially rather than delving into the deeper issues. I believe that our current inflation is a systemic inflation. Many of the problems we face today are related to past mistakes, but more importantly, they are due to the systemic flaws of yesterday. If we do not see it this way, rectification will be disconnected from deepening reform, and it will also be difficult to explain why our economic construction has experienced several overheating periods and multiple adjustments.

	Reporter: What do you think are the main drawbacks of the old system?

	Feng Yuzhong: First, there is the "iron rice bowl" and "big pot" system in employment and labor; second, in the property rights system, there is an excessive pursuit of being large, public, and pure, lacking a competitive mechanism, which fosters a lazy mindset of only taking and not giving. Our labor efficiency is extremely low, unparalleled in the world. The lack of property rights constraints makes government behavior short-sighted, focusing only on expanding the scale of construction without considering efficiency and consequences; it makes enterprise behavior short-term, seeking only immediate benefits and showing no interest in asset appreciation; it makes the monetary income of millions of workers flow only into consumption, "not buying land or houses, but buying TVs and refrigerators when they have money." These are the root causes of the vicious cycle of overconsumption, supply-demand imbalance, price increases, and inflation.

	Reporter: Why do the problems of yesterday manifest so prominently today?

	Feng Yuzhong: Inflation existed yesterday as well, but due to the practice of a single product economy and strong control measures at that time, it did not erupt.

	Reform and opening up have brought unprecedented vitality, of course, some negative phenomena have also emerged. I believe that the phenomenon of small vendors making big money and the unethical practices in the circulation sector are not brought about by a commodity economy, but rather by the underdevelopment of the commodity economy, which can only be overcome by further improving the market mechanism. People are dissatisfied with the unfair distribution, but first, we must recognize that egalitarianism is the greatest unfairness. Reform needs to be improved and complemented, but it absolutely cannot reverse course.

	I believe that people's concern for assets is too low, which is both a potential threat to economic stability and the biggest challenge for the next step in deepening reform. The exploration of this issue should be urgent.

	Reporter: The main task for the next two to three years is rectification, does this conflict with the exploration you mentioned?

	Feng Yuzhong: Rectification should not be a short-term behavior. Today's rectification is to create conditions for tomorrow's reform. We may have to take some emergency measures today, but we must explain the reasons and try to avoid setting new obstacles for the next step of reform. The central authorities should set aside some energy to think about tomorrow. Major reform measures (including the reform of the property rights system) can be delayed in implementation, but pilot projects should be allowed; theoretical discussions, public opinion preparation, and the design of operational procedures must be ahead of time.

　　昨天今天和明天        
    ——冯玉忠代表谈改革与治理整顿的关系
    本报记者  莫新元  
    （全国人大代表、辽宁大学校长、素有“实践型经济学家”称号的冯玉忠，日前接受了记者的采访。）
    记者：审议政府工作报告已有一星期，您有什么想法？
    冯玉忠：我总的感觉，我们在分析通货膨胀原因时，谈表层的多，谈深层的少。我认为我们现在的通货膨胀，是体制型的通货膨胀。我们现在遇到的许多问题，与工作失误有关，但更主要的是昨天体制上的弊端造成的。不这样看，治理整顿就会与深化改革脱节，也很难解释为什么我们的经济建设几度过热、几番调整。
    记者：您认为旧体制的主要弊端是什么？
    冯玉忠：一是就业和劳动制度上的“铁饭碗”、“大锅饭”；二是产权制度上片面追求一大、二公、三纯，缺乏竞争机制，助长了只思索取，不求奉献的懒汉思想。我们的工时效率之低，举世罕见。缺乏产权约束力，使政府行为急功近利，一味扩大基建规模，不考虑效益和后果；使企业行为短期化，只图眼前利益，对资产增殖无兴趣；使亿万职工的货币收入只能单向投入消费，“不买田地不买房，有钱就买彩电和冰箱”。这些正是造成超前消费、供求失衡、物价上涨以及通货膨胀等不良循环的病根。
    记者：昨天的病根，为什么会集中到今天来发作呢？
    冯玉忠：通货膨胀昨天也有，不过由于当时实行单一的产品经济、有强控手段而没有爆发出来。
    改革开放带来了前所未有的生机和活力，当然，一些消极现象也伴随而来。我认为，小商小贩发大财、流通领域的不正之风不是商品经济带来的，恰恰是商品经济不发达造成的，只能通过进一步完善市场机制来克服。人们对分配不公平不满，但是，首先要认识清楚，平均主义是最大的不公平。改革需要完善、配套，但绝不能走回头路。
    我认为人们对资产的关切度过低，既是稳定经济的潜在威胁，也是下一步深化改革所面临的最大困难。对这个问题的探索要有紧迫感。
    记者：今后两三年的主要任务是治理整顿，这跟您所说的探索是否有矛盾？
    冯玉忠：治理整顿也不能搞短期行为。今天的治理整顿，是为明天的改革创造条件。我们今天不得已采取一些应急措施，要把道理讲明，要尽可能避免为下一步改革设置新的障碍。中央要抽出一部分精力来为明天着想。重大的改革措施（包括产权制度的改革）可以推迟出台，但应该允许试点；理论探讨、舆论准备及操作程序的设计，则必须超前。
