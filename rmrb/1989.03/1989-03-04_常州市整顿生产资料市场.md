After the People's Daily published the letter to the editor titled "The Prosperity Behind Changzhou's Bo'ai Road" on the fifth page on January 7, the leaders of Changzhou City paid great attention to it. They instructed relevant departments to start by cleaning up the "Electromechanical Street" and strictly rectify and manage the production materials market. Currently, the Changzhou Municipal Bureau of Materials is working with the departments of industry and commerce, prices, taxation, and other relevant departments to conduct a comprehensive review and audit of electromechanical stores and other units engaged in the sale of production materials. Units that meet the operating conditions will be issued an operating permit by the Municipal Bureau of Materials, which will then be exchanged for a business license by the industry and commerce management department. For units that do not meet the operating conditions and engage in serious illegal operations, their business licenses will be revoked. At the same time, relevant departments have formulated the implementation details for the management of the production materials market, clearly stipulating the operating conditions, scope, links, and management methods of production materials operating units. Changzhou City will also establish a leading group for the management of the production materials market, composed of the departments of materials, industry and commerce, taxation, and prices, to be responsible for the inspection, supervision, and management of the production materials market.

To rectify and manage the "Electromechanical Street," the Changzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, together with the Changzhou Low-Voltage Electrical Appliance Factory, inspected 19 stores on this street and heavily fined the units engaged in illegal operations, with a total fine of over 9,000 yuan. The Municipal Electromechanical Equipment Company also adopted measures to directly supply important and scarce commodities to users and to prioritize the supply of general materials to factories. After these measures were implemented, illegal operations on Changzhou's Bo'ai Road have significantly decreased.

Leaders from the central government have also made instructions regarding the issues on Bo'ai Road, requiring the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics and the Ministry of Materials to organize forces to rectify the electromechanical products market. The Ministry of Materials, together with the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Materials, formed an investigation team to conduct a typical dissection on the "Electromechanical Street" of Bo'ai Road in Changzhou. Currently, the Ministry of Materials is drafting the management methods for the electromechanical products market.

### 常州市整顿生产资料市场

　　常州市整顿生产资料市场
    １月７日，你报第五版刊登《常州博爱路空前繁荣的背后》的读者来信后，常州市领导同志十分重视，要求有关部门从清理“机电一条街”入手，从严整顿治理生产资料市场。目前，常州市物资局正会同工商、物价、税收等有关部门，全面清理审查机电商店以及其他经营生产资料的单位，符合经营条件的由市物资局颁发经营许可证，然后由工商管理部门换发营业执照；对不具备经营条件、严重违法经营的单位，吊销营业执照。同时，有关部门还制订了生产资料市场管理实施细则，明确规定了生产资料经营单位的经营条件、经营范围、经营环节和管理方法等。常州市还将由物资、工商、税收、物价等部门联合组建生产资料市场管理领导小组，负责对生产资料市场的检查、监督和管理。
    为了整顿治理“机电一条街”，常州市工商管理局会同常州低压电器厂，抽查了这条街上的１９家商店，重罚了违法经营单位，罚款总额９０００多元。市机电设备公司还采取了重要、紧俏的商品直接向用户供应，一般物资优先供应工厂的办法。这些措施实施以后，常州博爱路上的违法经营活动大有收敛。
    中央有关领导同志对常州博爱路的问题也相继作了批示，要求机电部、物资部组织力量整顿机电产品市场。物资部与江苏省物资局组成调查组到常州博爱路“机电一条街”作了典型解剖。目前，物资部正在拟订机电产品市场管理办法。
