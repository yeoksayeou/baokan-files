Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 23rd.

The Central United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China today invited 26 members from various democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce who participated in the major inspections of taxation, finance, prices, fixed asset investment, and special investigations by the Supervision Department to hold a symposium. The purpose was to review and summarize the experiences of democratic party members in participating in these inspections recently.

During the symposium, many participants believed that participating in these inspections is a good way to promote the democratic parties' involvement and contribution, which is beneficial for democratic party members to participate in social practices and democratic supervision. It allows them to accumulate work experience through practice. Members of the inspection teams from the democratic parties believe that during the rectification and reorganization, it is necessary to strictly enforce the law and seriously handle the problems found during the inspections. They hope that the participation of democratic party members in social supervision should gradually become institutionalized. At the same time, the democratic parties should also make serious preparations in terms of organization and personnel, so that they can participate in various government works at any time.

    新华社北京３月２３日电  中共中央统战部今天邀请２６名参加税收、财务、物价大检查、清理固定资产投资大检查和监察部专项调查的各民主党派、全国工商联的成员举行座谈会，回顾总结民主党派成员近来参加这几项检查的经验。
    在座谈中，许多人认为，参加这些检查，是促进民主党派知情出力的好形式，有利于民主党派成员参加社会实践、民主监督，使他们在实践中积累工作经验。参加检查组的民主党派成员认为，在治理整顿中必须严肃执法，对检查出来的问题必须认真处理。他们希望，民主党派成员参加社会监督应逐步形成制度，同时，民主党派也应在组织上人才上进行认真准备，从而可以随时参加政府的各项工作。
