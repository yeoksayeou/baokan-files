The incoming Prime Minister of the Yugoslav Federal Government, Marković, yesterday presented a specific cabinet plan to the Federal Assembly's Federal Council Committee on Social and Political Relations. He will vigorously streamline the organization and enhance the efficiency and responsibilities of the Federal Government. Local public opinion praises this plan as a significant step in reforming the Federal Government.

Marković proposed that the number of members in the new government will be reduced from the current 29 to 19, abolishing 6 federal committees and 2 ministries, and establishing 12 ministries in total. These 12 ministries will function as independent administrative bodies, with their ministers also serving as members of the Federal Executive Council (the government). They will be truly responsible for their work and their administrative bodies. Additionally, many of the Federal Government's working bodies, especially the committees and coordination committees between republics, will be abolished. These are remnants of the "consultative economy" within the state apparatus, similar to the aforementioned 6 federal committees. Marković also suggested a decision to abolish the principle of unanimous agreement required for the passage of documents in the past. From now on, only laws and other regulations passed by the Federal Assembly can adjust social and material conditions. Marković believes that only in this way can the Federal Government become a rational organizational structure and function effectively.

To ensure the implementation of Marković's cabinet plan, the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia will pass the revised versions of two laws regarding the composition and authority of federal administrative bodies through an "emergency procedure." Then, on March 16, it will elect and form the new government.

　　南总理提出组阁方案
    精简机构加强政府效能和职责     
    舆论赞扬方案是改革巨大步骤
    本报贝尔格莱德３月１４日电  记者严正报道：即将上任的南斯拉夫联邦政府新总理马尔科维奇昨天向联邦议会联邦院社会政治关系委员会提出了具体的组阁方案，他将大力精简机构，加强联邦政府的效能和职责。此间舆论赞扬这个方案是改革联邦政府的一个巨大步骤。
    马尔科维奇提出，未来的新政府成员将从原有的２９人减为１９人，取消６个联邦委员会和２个部，共建立１２个部。这１２个部将作为独立的管理机构行使职权，其部长同时也是联邦执行委员会（即政府）的成员，他们对自己的工作和工作机构要真正地负起责任；同时还将取消联邦政府的许多工作机构，特别是那些共和国之间的委员会和协调委员会，因为它们与上述６个联邦委员会一样，都是所谓“协商经济”在国家机构中的残余。马尔科维奇还建议作出决定，以取消过去通过文件时必须一致同意的原则，今后只能由联邦议会通过的法律和其它规定来调整社会和物质情况。马尔科维奇认为，唯有这样才能使联邦政府成为合理的组织机构，并有效地工作。
    为了确保马尔科维奇的组阁方案得以实现，南联邦议会将以“紧急程序”通过有关联邦行政机构组成及其权限的二个法律的修订案，然后于３月１６日选举并组成新政府。
