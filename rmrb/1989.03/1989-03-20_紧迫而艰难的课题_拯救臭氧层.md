The Earth is our common home. For countless years, it has endured various hardships, but it has never faced a crisis like the ozone hole. Earlier this month, representatives from 123 countries gathered in London, once again calling out to "save the ozone layer."

	The Ozone Layer and Humanity

Between 10 to 50 kilometers above the Earth's surface in the stratosphere lies a layer called the ozone layer. Ozone is a gas composed of three oxygen atoms, denoted as O3. The ozone layer absorbs over 99% of ultraviolet radiation, protecting all living things on Earth. However, this protective umbrella of ours has been severely damaged. In 1984, scientists first discovered an ozone hole over the Antarctic. Later, the American "Nimbus-7" meteorological satellite detected this "hole," which was as large as the United States and as high as Mount Everest. The situation over the Arctic is also worrying. Recently, Dr. Robert Watson, Director of the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, stated that while an ozone hole has not yet appeared over the Arctic, the ozone layer there has been depleted by 19 to 24 kilometers compared to measurements taken in 1970. Some believe that even the global ozone layer has been affected. Data from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration shows that since 1969, the ozone layer over a vast area spanning the United States, Canada, Japan, China, the Soviet Union, and Western Europe has decreased by 3%.

Due to the destruction of the ozone layer, the "invisible killer" ultraviolet radiation can penetrate freely. Scientists have confirmed that for every 1% decrease in atmospheric ozone, the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface increases by 2%, and the incidence of skin cancer increases by about 4%. British scientists believe that due to the reduction in ozone, the number of skin cancer patients in Britain will increase by at least 15%; by 2060, the number of skin cancer patients in the United States will reach 40 million. Therefore, doctors have issued warnings to golf enthusiasts worldwide, and former U.S. President Reagan's golfing activities have reportedly been somewhat restricted.

Changes in the ozone layer can also damage the human immune system, increase the number of people suffering from cataracts and respiratory diseases, harm marine life, inhibit the growth of plant leaves and stems, and may even lead to a rise in global average temperatures, causing the greenhouse effect. Sea levels will also rise, turning coastal cities into vast oceans, fertile lands into deserts, and even causing some countries to disappear.

	The Culprit

Scientists have various theories. Some believe this may be related to the frequent forest fires in the Amazon region; others think that the ozone hole appears at the poles due to the extreme cold. A scientific team from the University of Kentucky in the United States believes that ozone levels may change with the natural cycle of solar activity.

However, most scientists believe that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are a major culprit in the destruction of the ozone layer. Unfortunately, over the past 50 years, humans have failed to recognize its dangers. CFCs were developed by the DuPont Company in the United States in 1930. Today, the global production of CFCs is approximately 100,000 tons, with Western countries producing 75,000 tons and the Soviet Union 6,000 tons. They are mainly used to manufacture refrigerants, foaming agents, cleaning agents, and propellants. Today, they are widely used in both industrial production and household life, releasing large amounts of CFCs. Unlike most industrial chemicals, CFCs do not decompose in the lower atmosphere but float up into the stratosphere, where they react with ultraviolet radiation to produce free chlorine atoms. A single chlorine atom can destroy nearly 100,000 ozone molecules, converting ozone into pure oxygen and losing its ability to absorb ultraviolet radiation. Currently, scientists worldwide are tracking and exploring this issue.

	Strategies and Challenges

Most countries agree that the most convenient and cost-effective way to save the ozone layer is to stop producing and using CFCs as soon as possible. The international community has held multiple meetings to discuss strategies. In March 1985, more than 20 countries, including the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and Canada, signed the "International Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer," calling on signatory countries to take measures to protect the ozone layer and strengthen scientific research cooperation. The "Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer," which has been ratified by 31 countries, came into effect on January 1, 1989. It stipulates that signatory countries must reduce their CFC usage to half of the 1986 levels by the end of the century. The meeting held earlier this month in London pushed human efforts to save the ozone layer to a new stage. The European Community countries have agreed to completely stop using CFCs by the end of the century; the United States banned the use of CFCs as propellants in 1978; Belgium and Portugal have announced a ban on the production of CFCs.

However, in today's world, from refrigerators and cars to hard plastic films and soft furniture; from computer chips to fire extinguishers, everything relies on CFCs. Therefore, it is necessary to research and develop substitute materials and technologies. Currently, the manufacturing methods for substitutes are complex, their performance is poor, and the cost is high. If the world completely stops using CFCs and universally adopts substitutes, at least $10 billion will be needed. Furthermore, industrialized countries have shown a lukewarm attitude towards the third world's proposal for international financial aid. More challenging is that this is not just a financial issue but also involves changes in industrial structure. Obviously, saving the ozone layer is an urgent and difficult task for humanity.

### 紧迫而艰难的课题  拯救臭氧层

　　紧迫而艰难的课题
    拯救臭氧层
    何崇元
    地球是我们人类共同的家。多少年来，它虽然经受着各种磨难，可从未面临臭氧空洞这样的危机。本月初，世界１２３个国家的代表云集伦敦，再一次发出了“拯救臭氧层”的呼喊。
    　　　　臭氧层与人类
    离地球表面１０—５０公里的同温层中有一气层，叫臭氧层。臭氧是一种气体，分子由３个氧原子组成，即Ｏ３。臭氧层能吸收９９％以上的紫外线，以保护地球上的生灵万物。但是，地球的这把“保护伞”已遭到严重破坏。１９８４年，科学家们首次发现南极上空出现了臭氧空洞。后来，美国“雨云—７号”气象卫星测到这个“洞”，大如美国，高似珠峰。北极的情况也令人担忧。美国航空和航天局局长罗伯特·沃森博士新近说，北极还没有出现空洞，但这里的臭氧层与１９７０年测试结果相比，已被吞掉１９—２４公里深。还有人认为，甚至全球臭氧层都受到损害。美国宇航局的资料表明，自１９６９年以来，横跨美国、加拿大、日本、中国、苏联、西欧等国广阔地带的臭氧层已减少了３％。
    由于臭氧层被破坏，“无影杀手”紫外线可长驱直入。科学家们证实，大气中的臭氧每减少１％，照射到地面的紫外线就增加２％，皮肤癌发生率则增加４％左右。英国科学家认为，由于臭氧减少，英国的皮肤癌患者至少会增加１５％；到２０６０年，美国的皮肤癌患者将达到０．４亿人。因此，医生们对全球高尔夫球运动的爱好者提出了警告，前美国总统里根的高尔夫球运动据说也受到一定的限制。 　臭氧层的变化还会损害人的免疫系统；使患白内障和呼吸道疾病的人增多；损害海洋生物；阻止植物的叶茎生长；还可能导致世界平均气温上升，引起温室效应；海平面也将增高，使沿海城市变成滔滔汪洋，肥沃的土地成为沙漠，甚至有的国家也可能由此消失。
    　　　　谁是“元凶”
    科学家对此众说纷纭。有的认为，这可能跟亚马孙地区不断出现森林火灾有关；有的认为，臭氧洞之所以出现在两极，是极地低温造成的；美国肯塔基大学的一个科学小组则认为，臭氧水平可能是随着太阳黑子活动的自然周期而变化的。
    但是，多数科学家认为，氯氟烃是破坏臭氧层的一大元凶。不幸的是，在过去的５０多年里，人类竟然未能发觉它的可怕性。氯氟烃于１９３０年由美国杜邦公司研制问世。现在，全世界氯氟烃的产量大约是１００万吨。其中西方国家占７５万吨，苏联占６万吨。它主要用于制造制冷剂、发泡剂、洗净剂和推进剂。今天，无论在工业生产上还是在家庭生活中，使用都极其广泛，排放出了大量氯氟烃。而它又不像多数工业用化学物质那样能在低空中分解，而是飘浮升入同温层，与紫外线作用产生出游移的氯原子，氯原子夺去臭氧中的一个氧原子（一个氯原子能破坏近１０万个臭氧分子），使臭氧变成纯氧，从而丧失其吸收紫外线的性能。眼下，世界各国科学家们正在对此追踪探索。
    　　　　对策与难题
    多数国家认为，尽快停止生产和使用氯氟烃，是当前挽救臭氧层最方便、最省钱的办法。国际社会已多次为此开会，商讨对策。１９８５年３月，美国、苏联、日本、加拿大等２０多个国家签署了《保护臭氧层国际公约》，要求签字国采取措施，保护臭氧层，并加强科研合作；已有３１个国家批准的《关于消耗臭氧层物质的蒙特利尔议定书》，今年１月１日也已经生效，它规定签字国在本世纪末要把氯氟烃使用量减少到１９８６年的一半；本月初在伦敦召开的会议把人类拯救臭氧层的行动推向了一个新阶段。欧共体国家已同意到本世纪末完全停止使用氯氟烃；美国早在１９７８年就禁止使用氯氟烃作喷雾剂；比利时和葡萄牙则宣布禁止生产氯氟烃。
    然而，在当今世界上，从冷冻机、冰箱、汽车到硬质薄膜、软垫家具；从计算机芯片到灭火器，都离不开氯氟烃。所以，必须研究出它的代用物质及技术。目前，替代品的制造方法复杂，且性能差，成本高。如果全世界完全不使用氯氟烃，普遍采用代用品，至少要投资１００亿美元。另外，工业化国家对第三世界要求提供国际基金援助的建议又持冷淡态度。更为困难的是，这不仅仅是一个资金问题，也涉及到工业结构的改变。显然，拯救臭氧层是人类面临的一个急迫而艰难的课题。
