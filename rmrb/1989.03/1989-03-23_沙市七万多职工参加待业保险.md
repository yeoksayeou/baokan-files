Over 70,000 workers in Shashi participate in unemployment insurance

    According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan on March 22, 130 state-owned enterprises in Shashi, Hubei Province, are no longer worried about the social issues that arise when workers are laid off or voluntarily leave. These enterprises, which have over 70,000 workers, have all joined the unified management of the unemployment insurance fund.

    To match the labor system reform, the Shashi municipal government decided last year to establish a unified management system for the unemployment insurance fund. The system stipulates that each enterprise shall contribute 1% of the total wage bill as a special fund, which will be managed by the municipal labor service company and used for living subsidies for workers during unemployment. According to the regulations, workers who are laid off or voluntarily leave the enterprise can receive 70% of their original wages as living subsidies after registering with the municipal labor service company. However, those who fail to be assigned a job after three arrangements by the labor service company will no longer receive living subsidies.

　　沙市七万多职工参加待业保险
    据新华社武汉３月２２日电  （记者杨正文）湖北省沙市１３０家国营企业不再担心职工被辞退或自动离职后带来的社会问题，共有７万多名职工的这些企业都参加了职工待业保险基金统筹。
    为了与劳动制度改革配套，沙市市政府去年决定建立职工待业保险基金统筹制度。制度规定，各企业按职工工资总额１％的比例提出专款，交市劳动服务公司统一管理，作为职工在失业期间生活救济之用。按规定被企业辞退或自动离职的职工，到市劳动服务公司办理待业登记手续后，可领取本人原工资７０％的生活救济款；但经劳动服务公司三次安排仍不上岗的人，则不再给予生活救济金。
