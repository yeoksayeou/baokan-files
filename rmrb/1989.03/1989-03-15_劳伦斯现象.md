Title: The Lawrence Phenomenon

Like many writers, the British novelist and poet D.H. Lawrence once proudly and bitterly declared: "My works belong to the next century."

Before the mid-20th century, Western critics who advocated "moral criticism" spared no effort to eliminate Lawrence's "harmful influence." However, the situation changed dramatically thereafter. In the 1950s, Lawrence suddenly became "one of the greatest and most creative novelists of our time." This was not merely because the sense of "moral consciousness" had declined in the European and American critical circles over the past few decades, but ultimately due to profound changes within Western society itself.

In Lawrence's era, Britain was largely adhering to traditional values. In their view, there was a certain harmony and balance between humans and their environment. Traditional moral norms, which regulated relationships between people and society, did not possess a nature that opposed human beings. Therefore, Lawrence's advocacy for human natural instincts and his extreme emphasis on the value of human existence were seen as "immoral" behaviors that disrupted the harmony between people and society. However, in the eyes of a new generation of readers who had experienced the horrors of World War II, there was no harmony or balance between people and their environment, but rather a state of separation. War, economic crises, nuclear threats, and alienation phenomena constantly reminded them of this. Human life had lost its richness, and the value of human existence was increasingly threatened. It was precisely because Lawrence's works revealed the tragic conflict between civilization and humans, examined the tragic state of modern human existence, and expressed the human pursuit of an ideal society free from alienation, that they gained undeniable significance. Lawrence's status as a first-rate writer in world literature history can be said to have been established with the abnormal development of Western industrialism.

It is said that Lawrence once expressed his desire to travel to the East, to China. However, this writer, who died at the age of 45, not only failed to fulfill his wish but also saw his name fall into obscurity in China for decades. In fact, Lawrence's works had some influence on modern Chinese literature. Qu Qiubai, Yu Dafu, Rao Shuyi, and others had commented on him. However, due to well-known reasons, Lawrence's name became unfamiliar to Chinese readers over the past few decades, and Chinese scholars of foreign literature also avoided him as if he were a plague.

In recent years, with the profound changes in Chinese society, Lawrence's works have been translated and introduced at an astonishing speed. Those who pay attention to the publishing industry's dynamics would hardly deny that a "Lawrence fever" is spreading across mainland China. At the end of 1987, the author conducted an absolutely incomplete statistics: by the end of 1987, the total print run of various works by this once-neglected writer in mainland China had exceeded 600,000 copies. A year has passed, and this trend shows no signs of abating. So far, Lawrence's major works have been published in more than one version. In today's publishing and distribution of "pure literature," this is undoubtedly a phenomenon worth pondering.

It is gratifying to see that the Chinese foreign literature community has noticed this "Lawrence fever." In late October 1988, the first "Lawrence Symposium" was held in Shanghai, with more than 50 scholars from China and abroad conducting extensive and in-depth discussions on the research and translation of Lawrence's works. Experts from England, America, Canada, Italy, and Japan brought their latest research findings, especially the brilliant speeches by international renowned Lawrence authorities Keith Sagar and James C. Cowan, which allowed us to understand the highest level of current Lawrence research. Chinese scholars' evaluations of Lawrence's creation from the perspective of their own national cultural traditions also aroused great interest and attention from foreign counterparts. The "Chinese Lawrence Research Association" was officially established at this conference. Obviously, this will greatly promote the research on Lawrence by the Chinese foreign literature community, and a true and credible image of Lawrence will appear before the broad readers. In fact, its significance is not limited to this. The correct attitude and in-depth exploration of Lawrence's creation will undoubtedly have a positive impact on China's contemporary literary circles. When "sex" is no longer a taboo for us today, Lawrence's deep concern for human destiny and his serious and dedicated creative attitude may also be enlightening for our writers.

　　“劳伦斯现象”
     王立新
    像许多作家一样，英国小说家、诗人劳伦斯曾狂傲而辛酸地宣称：我的作品是属于下个世纪的。
    ２０世纪中叶以前，崇尚“道德批评”的西方评论家们不遗余力地消除劳伦斯的“不良影响”，但此后的情形却发生了戏剧性的变化。５０年代，劳伦斯一跃成为“我们时代最伟大的、富于创造力的小说家之一”。这并非因为最近几十年间欧美评论界中“道德意识”的衰落，归根到底还是由于西方社会自身的深刻变化。
    劳伦斯时代的英国，人们大都恪守着旧有的价值标准，在他们看来，人与生存环境之间保持着某种和谐、平衡的关系，作为调节人与人、人与社会之间关系的传统道德规范，并不具有与人本身对立的性质，因此，劳伦斯弘扬人的自然本性，极端突出人自身的存在价值，是一种破坏人与人、人与社会之间和谐关系的“非道德”行为。而在沐浴过第二次世界大战腥风血雨的新一代读者看来，人与人，人与生存环境之间并无什么和谐、平衡可言，而是呈现出一种分离状态。战争、经济危机、核恐怖、异化现象都在时刻提醒着这一点。人的生命丧失了存在的丰富性，人自身的价值受到日益严重的威胁。劳伦斯的作品正是由于揭示了文明与人的悲剧性冲突，考察了现代人生存的悲剧性状况，表达了人类对消除异化的理想社会形态的追求，而具有了不容忽视的意义。劳伦斯在世界文学史上一流作家的地位，可以说是随着西方工业主义的畸形发展而被确立的。
    据说劳伦斯曾表示过要到东方的中国旅行，然而这位４５岁就早逝的作家不仅未能一了心愿，连他的姓名也在中国沉寂了几十年。其实，劳伦斯的创作对我国现代文学并非没有影响，瞿秋白、郁达夫、饶述一等人都曾对他做过评述；只是由于众所周知的原因，劳伦斯的名字在近几十年中对我国读者陌生起来，我国研究外国文学的人，对这位早已声震遐迩的大作家也避之唯恐不及。
    近年来随着我国社会生活的深刻变化，劳伦斯的作品以惊人的速度大量译介过来。稍注意一下出版界动态的人恐怕都不会否认，一股“劳伦斯热”正在中国大陆蔓延。１９８７年岁末，笔者曾做过一个绝对不能说是完整的统计：截至１９８７年底，这位一度遭受冷落的作家的各类作品，在中国大陆的总印数已突破６０万册。一年过去了，这种势头有增无减，到目前为止，劳伦斯的重要作品都出了不止一种版本。在“纯文学”的出版和发行步履维艰的今天，这无疑是令人深思的现象。
    令人高兴的是，我国外国文学界已注意到了这种“劳伦斯热”。１９８８年１０月下旬，首届“劳伦斯研讨会”在沪召开，中外学者５０余人就劳伦斯作品的研究和翻译作了广泛而深入的探讨。来自英、美、加、意、日等国的专家带来了自己的最新研究成果，特别是国际著名劳伦斯权威凯斯·萨加、詹姆斯·鲍顿的精彩发言让我们了解了当今劳伦斯研究的最高水平。中国学者从本民族文化传统的角度对劳伦斯创作的评价，也同样引起了外国同行的极大关注和兴趣。“中国劳伦斯研究会”在本次会议上宣告诞生。显然，这将极大地推动我国外国文学界对劳伦斯的研究，一个真实可信的劳伦斯形象将会出现在广大读者面前。事实上，它的意义并不仅限于此。对劳伦斯创作的正确态度和深入探讨，必定也会对我国当代文坛产生积极的影响。当“性”在今天已不再成为我们的禁区时，劳伦斯对人类命运的深切关注和呕心沥血的严肃创作态度，对我们的作家也许亦不无启示吧。
