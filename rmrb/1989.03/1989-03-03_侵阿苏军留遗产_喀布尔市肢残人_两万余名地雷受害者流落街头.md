Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, March 2nd.

Thousands of disabled individuals roam the streets of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, daily. This is the "legacy" left behind by a decade of war in this ancient city.

According to official statistics provided by an official from the International Red Cross in Kabul, there are over 20,000 landmine victims alone in this city, with the number of disabled individuals in other parts of Afghanistan being incalculable. This official stated that the International Red Cross Hospital began treating patients on October 1st of last year, and in the first three days, they performed 1,600 amputations. The waiting list for prosthetic limbs at this hospital is scheduled until 1991. The official added, "When millions of Afghan refugees return from Pakistan and Iran, they will face millions of various types of landmines."

Most of these disabled individuals are teenagers. They skillfully maneuver through crowds using crutches or stand in long lines to buy bread. These individuals often sleep under the eaves of shops or at bus stations. Reports indicate that these individuals are victims of "butterfly mines," which are designed to maim rather than kill. If one steps on an anti-personnel mine or anti-tank mine, they will at least lose both legs.

Reports also indicate that after the withdrawal of Soviet troops, many unexploded bombs, grenades, and landmines were left behind, often played with by unsuspecting children, frequently resulting in injuries or deaths. Near a certain airport, six children were playing with an incendiary bomb, which accidentally caught fire, leaving all of them severely burned.

### 侵阿苏军留遗产　喀布尔市肢残人  两万余名地雷受害者流落街头

    侵阿苏军留遗产　喀布尔市肢残人
    两万余名地雷受害者流落街头
    本报伊斯兰堡3月2日电　记者任毓骏报道：综合此间报纸及外电报道，阿富汗首都喀布尔市每天都有数以万计的伤残人流落街头，这是10年战争留给这座文明古城的“遗产”。
    据国际红十字会驻喀布尔的一位官员提供的“官方统计数字”，这座城市中仅地雷受害者就有2万余人，而阿富汗其他地方的伤残人数无法计算。据这位官员介绍，国际红十字会医院于去年10月1日开始收治伤员，头3天就作了1600例截肢手术。要求在这家医院装假肢的名单已安排到1991年。这位官员还说：“数百万阿富汗难民从巴基斯坦和伊朗回国的时候，等待他们的将是数百万各色各样的地雷。”
    这些伤残人中多数是青少年，他们熟练地拄着双拐在人群中穿行，或夹在街头买面包的长蛇阵中。这些人经常露宿在商店屋檐下或是汽车站。据报道，这些人是专门对付人的“蝴蝶雷”的受害者。这种雷由直升机撒布，目的是致残而非致命。若踩上反工兵雷或反坦克雷，轻者也要失去双腿。
    据报道，苏军撤离后遗弃的许多炸弹、手榴弹和地雷，被不懂事的儿童当作玩具，往往造成伤亡。某机场附近6名儿童玩弄一颗燃烧弹时不慎起火，全被烧成重伤。
