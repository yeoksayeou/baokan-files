World's first female scientist to venture into the depths of Antarctica—Deputy Researcher Jin Qingmin of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Mineral Resources—discovered a large iron ore deposit during her expedition to the summit of Vinson Massif at the end of last year. This is the first mineral deposit discovered by China in Antarctica.

Vinson Massif is one of the world's seven highest peaks. The climate here is extremely cold, the terrain treacherous, and there are no signs of human habitation or life forms within thousands of square kilometers, earning it the nickname "death zone." To this day, it remains an unexplored area in geological research.

On November 25 of last year, Jin Qingmin joined the Sino-American joint mountaineering scientific expedition team for a 10-day scientific investigation of Vinson Massif. To make the most of the limited time for scientific research, she voluntarily gave up the opportunity to climb to the summit and conducted a 4-day geological survey alone in the desolate ice fields. With her rich experience in field investigations and geological knowledge, she drew 5 geological cross-sections on Vinson Massif and collected 40 kilograms of rock and mineral samples. On December 2, she discovered an exposed iron ore deposit at an altitude of 3,000 meters on a ridge. After tracing and surveying, it was found to be an iron ore belt with a controlled length of over 20 kilometers, a width of about 200 meters, and an iron content ranging from 30% to 50%. Overjoyed, Jin Qingmin immediately planted a vibrant five-star red flag on the iron ore rock.

This activity was carried out in accordance with the mountaineering agreement signed in April 1987 between the Chinese Mountaineering Association and the American McDonnell Expedition Network. Before this, the Chinese mountaineering team had never reached the highest peak in Antarctica. Jin Qingmin, who is 50 years old this year, was a member of the Chinese mountaineering team in the 1960s and has been engaged in mountaineering exploration and field geological surveys for many years.

### 我女科学家南极探险  文森峰上发现大铁矿

    我女科学家南极探险  文森峰上发现大铁矿
    据新华社南京3月2日电　（记者徐机玲）世界上第一位深入南极腹地的女科学家——南京地质矿产研究所副研究员金庆民，去年底赴南极之巅文森峰考察时，发现了一个大铁矿。这是我国首次在南极发现的矿藏。
    文森峰是世界七大高峰之一。这里气候极寒，山势险峻，方圆数千平方公里内没有人烟，没有生物，被人们称为“死亡地带”，至今仍是地质学研究的空白区。
    去年11月25日，金庆民随中美联合登山科学考察队赴文森峰作为期10天的科学考察。为抓紧有限时间开展科学考察，她主动放弃向顶峰冲击的机会，只身一人在荒原冰海中进行了4天地质考察。她以丰富的野外考察经验和地学知识，在文森峰绘制了5条地质剖面图，采集了40公斤的岩矿标本。12月2日，她在海拔3000米高度的一处山脊上，发现了铁矿露头，经追索勘查，这是一个控制长度在20公里以上，宽度约200米，铁含量在30％至50％之间的赤铁矿带。激动万分的金庆民当即在铁矿岩上插了一面鲜艳的五星红旗。
    这次活动是根据1987年4月中国登山协会与美国麦克敦探险网签订的登山协议进行的。在此以前，中国登山队还没有到过南极最高峰。今年50岁的金庆民，早在60年代就是中国登山队队员，多年来一直从事登山探险和野外地质考察。
