	Generally speaking, those who do good deeds are called "Living Le Fengs," but this honor seems to be reserved for military personnel.

	On the morning of February 28, in front of the Wangxinglou Hotel in Guangzhou, an elderly man with a head full of silver hair was walking on the street with a cane. There was a septic tank by the roadside, and due to construction, the iron cover had a large hole. The old man had poor vision and unfortunately fell into the septic tank.

	"Save the person! Quick, save the person!" An old woman discovered this and shouted loudly.

	The street was bustling with traffic, and pedestrians hurried past. Soon, the hole above the septic tank was surrounded by people. However, despite the old man struggling in the septic tank, no one came forward to save him. A few fashionable young women even covered their noses with handkerchiefs, saying, "Ugh, it's so smelly! It's so smelly!"

	At this moment, two soldiers drove by and heard that the old man had fallen into the septic tank. They immediately stopped the car to rescue him. They pushed through the crowd, and one soldier jumped into the septic tank first, using his hands to lift the old man. The other soldier stood on the iron cover and hugged the old man around the waist. The old man was rescued and brought out. They then took him home according to the provided address. The soldiers did not say anything, leaving with the cold and stench on their bodies. They left behind a very "fashionable" phrase, "The People's Liberation Army, Living Le Feng!"

	The rescued old man is named Jiang Fahui, 73 years old, and is a retired worker. He lives at 16 Xiajianwu, Shahe. He has one son in Hong Kong and four daughters who are married. When the reporter visited his home for an interview, the old man said gratefully, "Thanks to the two soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. They are Living Le Fengs serving the people. Otherwise, my old life would have been over!" His wife, Bear Yan, is also over 70 years old. She added, "I know that in the past, old people on the street had someone to help, and someone would give up their seat on the bus. Now it's not the case. There are fewer and fewer Le Fengs." "The Living Le Feng saved my husband, and we didn't even have time to say thank you. We are really sorry, please help us find them!"

	After much effort, the reporter found these two "Living Le Fengs" at the First Communication Headquarters of the Guangzhou Military Region. They are Battalion Commander Tang Donglian and Platoon Commander Shi Keren. Interestingly, the "Living Le Fengs" did not talk about the rescue but shared many thought-provoking reflections:

	As a soldier and a citizen, it is our duty to save lives and help those in need. If others did not do what they should have, and we did, it is called "Living Le Feng." What is there to be proud of? If there were no Le Fengs in the world, and if we had not passed by the septic tank, could we really bear to let the old man drown?

	We do not understand why, after learning from Le Feng for more than 20 years, some people's moral standards are still so low. According to reports, in Weifang, a young girl was seriously injured by a truck. Her companions on the road begged passing cars to stop and save her, stopping dozens of cars, but no one was willing to help. Later, a military vehicle passed by and quickly took her to the hospital. In Wuhan, a soldier who had his leg amputated due to injury once took a bus. In a situation where no one on the entire bus gave up their seat for a sick old person, he stood up to offer his seat and was mocked by a few young people as "a one-legged Le Feng has come to the world." For these ugly phenomena, relying on public opinion to condemn is not enough; legislation must be used to punish.

	Seeing righteousness and helping others is a public virtue that every citizen should uphold and should not become the exclusive right of the People's Liberation Army. We hope that everyone has a heart of love. With the development of the commodity economy and the improvement of the public morality of the Chinese people, we hope that "Living Le Feng" will be something everyone strives for.

　　一老翁堕入粪池，上前搭救者只有两位军人，请问：
    救人是军人“专利”吗？
    李石元　方澜高
    大凡做了好事的人，人们都称他为“活雷锋”，然而，这顶“桂冠”似乎都是留给军人们戴的。
    ２月２８日上午，广州市望星楼宾馆前，一位满头银发的老人拄着拐棍在马路上行走。马路边有个化粪池，因为施工，上面的铁板盖被掀了个大窟窿，老人视力极差，一脚不幸，堕入了粪池。
    “救人啦，快救人啦！”一位阿婆发现，大声疾呼。
    马路上车水马龙，行人匆匆，不一会，粪池的洞口围满了人。可是，任凭老人在粪池中挣扎，却没有一个下去救的。几位摩登女郎还用手绢捂着鼻子，“嗯，真臭！真臭！”
    这时，两位军人驱车路过此地，听说老人落入粪池，便立即停车搭救。他们拨开人群，一个军人首先跳入粪池，用手托起老人，另一个军人站在铁板上拦腰抱起老人。老人被救了出来，他们又根据提供的住址，把他送回家去。军人什么都没说，带着满身的寒冷和臭气驱车走了。他们身后自然留下一句最“时髦”的语言，“解放军，活雷锋！”
    被救的老人名叫江发辉，今年７３岁，是位退休的老工人。他家住沙河下江屋１６号，一个儿子在香港，四个姑娘出嫁了。当记者来到他家采访时，老人感激地说，“多亏两位解放军，他们是为人民服务的活雷锋，要不，我的老命完蛋了！”他老伴熊艳也是年逾古稀的人，搭上话说，“我知道，过去老人上街有人扶，坐车有人让，现在不行了，雷锋越来越少了。”“活雷锋救了我老伴，我们连句谢谢的话都来不及说，真对不住，你们一定帮我找着啊！”
    几经周折，记者在广州军区第一通讯总站找到了这两位“活雷锋”，他们是少校教导员唐东联和中尉指导员石克仁。奇怪的是，“活雷锋”都不讲救人的事，却谈了许多发人深思的感想：
    作为一名军人，一个公民，见死相救，见难相帮，是应尽的责任。别人该做的没有做，我们做了就称为“活雷锋”，有什么光荣？假如世上没有雷锋，假如我们不从化粪池路过，难道就忍心让老人活活淹死吗？
    我们不明白，学雷锋２０多年了，为什么有些人的道德水准还是那么低。据报载，在潍坊，一位少女被卡车撞成重伤，同行者在路上招手、作揖，哀求过往车辆停车救人，一连拦了几十辆轿车、面包车，竟无一人肯救，后来是一辆军车路过，才赶紧把她送到医院。在武汉，一位因受伤而被截肢的解放军战士，有次乘公共汽车，在全车无一人给生病老人让座的情况下，自己起来相让，竟被几个青年讥笑为“独脚雷锋降世了”。对这些丑恶现象，光靠舆论指责还不够，必须用立法来制裁。
    见义勇为、助人为乐，是每个公民应尽的公德，不应成为解放军的“专利”。希望人人都有片爱心，随着商品经济的发展，国人公德水平的提高，但愿“活雷锋”人人为之。
