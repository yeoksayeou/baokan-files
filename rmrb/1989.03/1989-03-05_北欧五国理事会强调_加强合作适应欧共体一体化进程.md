The five-day-long 37th annual meeting of the Nordic Council concluded today in Stockholm. The meeting emphasized that the five Nordic countries will further strengthen cooperation and coordinate policies to adapt to the integration process of the European Community.

The Nordic Council is a consultative and advisory body for the parliaments and governments of the five Nordic countries, holding an annual meeting. The main agenda of this meeting was how to strengthen cooperation between the Nordic countries and the European Community. The heads of government from the five countries all stressed in their speeches that, facing the challenges of European Community integration, the five Nordic countries need to strengthen cooperation to enhance the position and influence of the Nordic region in the process of establishing the EC's internal market. The meeting believed that the five Nordic countries need to further expand cooperation in areas such as the labor market, labor environment policies, and consumer protection, remove barriers to the flow of goods, services, capital, and personnel, and through cooperation in research, development, and export promotion, enhance the competitiveness of Nordic industry.

Swedish Prime Minister Carlsson emphasized at the meeting that the five Nordic countries need to develop their internal market first to achieve the "entire European market."

Some parliamentarians and ministers from various countries pointed out in their speeches that Nordic cooperation predates European Community cooperation. For example, the Nordic countries established a common labor market as early as the 1950s and implemented mutual visa exemptions among countries. However, the pace of European Community cooperation has surpassed that of the Nordic countries. Nordic countries should strengthen cooperation in all areas that the EC's internal market will involve, take consistent actions through consultation as much as possible, and enhance the influence of the Nordic region.

The meeting unanimously agreed to strengthen economic and trade sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The meeting rejected the proposal to admit the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic into the Nordic Council.

　　北欧五国理事会强调
    加强合作适应欧共体一体化进程
    本报斯德哥尔摩３月３日电  记者顾耀铭报道：为期５天的北欧理事会第３７届年会今天在这里结束。会议强调北欧５国将进一步加强合作，协调政策，以适应欧洲共同体的一体化进程。
    北欧理事会是北欧５国议会、政府间的协商和咨询机构，每年举行一次例会。这次会议的重要议题是如何加强北欧国家与欧洲共同体的合作。与会的５国政府首脑在发言中都强调，面临来自欧洲共同体一体化的挑战，北欧５国需要加强合作，在欧共体内部大市场建立的过程中增强北欧的地位和影响。会议认为，北欧５国需要进一步扩大在劳务市场、劳动环境政策和消费者利益保护方面的合作，撤除商品、服务、资金和人员流通的障碍，通过在研究、发展和促进出口等方面的合作，增强北欧工业的竞争能力。
    瑞典首相卡尔松在会上强调，北欧５国首先需要发展内部市场，以图实现“整个欧洲的大市场”。
    一些国家的议员、部长在发言中指出，北欧合作早于欧洲共同体合作，如北欧早在５０年代就建立了共同劳务市场，实行各国间互免签证等，但是欧洲共同体的合作步伐已超过了北欧。北欧国家应该在欧洲共同体内部市场将要涉及到的所有领域增强合作，尽可能通过协商采取一致的行动，以增强北欧的影响。
    会议一致赞成加强对南非种族政权的经济贸易制裁。会议否决了吸收苏联爱沙尼亚加盟共和国加入北欧理事会的提案。
