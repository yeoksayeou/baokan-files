A Middle East conference titled "The Path to Peace" was held yesterday at Columbia University in New York. Approximately 400 people, including officials from the Palestine Liberation Organization and opposition party members of the Israeli Knesset, attended the conference. It is reported that the U.S. government plans to propose to Israel and the PLO that both sides take steps to ease tensions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, thereby building mutual trust and laying the foundation for peace talks. The U.S. has proposed to Israel that it release several thousand Palestinians detained by the Israeli military in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, reopen schools, and suspend or limit the use of administrative detention. At the same time, the U.S. has proposed to the PLO that it cease demonstrations and violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, stop attacks on Israeli forces in southern Lebanon, and stop distributing leaflets.
