The people of Shanxi Province have long been known for their skill in accumulating wealth. However, now even some long-time depositors with decades of savings no longer want to put their money in the bank. What is the reason for this?

Reporter: The people of Shanxi Province have long been known for their skill in accumulating wealth. However, now even some long-time depositors with decades of savings no longer want to put their money in the bank. What is the reason for this?

Wang Lianjun (an employee of a trading company in Taiyuan): This is true. Since last August, prices have risen so sharply that it's better to store goods than money. My family had a few thousand yuan. At the beginning of last year, we spent 1,800 yuan to buy a color TV. Now, an 18-inch color TV costs 2,800 to 3,000 yuan. Looking back, it was a good buy.

Reporter: Those who bought color TVs certainly got a good deal. But how many people can buy color TVs at the right price? Some people see goods and buy them, stockpiling items that are neither scarce nor urgently needed, resulting in a "burden." Isn't this also unprofitable?

Zhao Yiming (a resident of Jingsong Road, Taiyuan): During the panic buying last year, my wife withdrew over 3,000 yuan from the bank and bought two wool blankets, three pairs of leather shoes, two mosquito nets, and a single-tub washing machine. Now, the blankets are a bit useful, but the rest are either not needed or of poor quality. It would have been better to keep the money in the bank.

Reporter: Many people with a lot of cash on hand still prefer to keep it in their own pockets rather than deposit it in the bank to earn interest. Why is this?

Shao Fengqi (manager of a plastic leather factory in Taiyuan): To be honest, those with the most money in society are mainly businesspeople and those making "extra income." Their money is too easy to earn. Some individual vendors I know hardly make money without evading taxes or cheating. In the bustling streets of Taiyuan's Liu Xian, a street vendor can make 500 to 600 yuan a day. A peddler making a trip to Chengdu by train to sell cigarettes can make 600 to 700 yuan if not caught. Young "speculators" find money easy to come by and spend it freely, smoking high-end cigarettes, drinking "Wuliangye," eating out, wasting half of what they order, and spending money like water. Do you think such people care about the interest from the bank?

Reporter: Such people are indeed a minority. Most individual business operators are law-abiding. Why don't they want to deposit their money in the bank?

An Shuwen (owner of a halal snack shop in Jiancaoping, Taiyuan): Specialized households, individual business operators... do not want to deposit money in the bank mainly because it is inconvenient to withdraw and deposit. Money in hand can be spent as needed, whenever needed. In January, I bought ten bags of pollock from a state-owned meat distribution center. Our bank account had money, but the distribution center insisted on cash, so we had to spend 60 yuan on a tricycle.

Wang Lianjun: Now, the power of urban and rural individual operators is significant. No matter what business they are in, they have to find their own supply channels and do not rely on state-owned distribution centers. These people often have large amounts of cash on hand, with sums of three, five, ten, or even eighty thousand yuan not being uncommon. Using cash to purchase goods, such as buying oranges and pomelos from the south, is even cheaper than using remittances. Operators fear having their money restricted in the bank, so they prefer to carry suitcases full of cash, running around, rather than using remittances.

Reporter: This leads to what people call "currency circulation outside the system"?

Zhang Shulian (manager of the North City Credit Union in Taiyuan, accountant): Yes. Since last autumn, there has been a decline in savings, and the reasons are multifaceted: too much cash is circulating privately, individual business operators and specialized households conduct large-scale cash transactions, state-owned and collective enterprises with accounts in state banks do not follow national cash management regulations, leading to a large amount of excess cash accumulation and stagnation. For a period, the "San Guan" brand safes produced in Taiyuan became a hot commodity. Tens of thousands of small safes and small "banks" appeared, greatly impacting the state bank's cash recovery. Account-holding units have money in their accounts but cannot withdraw it, so they are even less willing to deposit money in the bank.

Shao Fengqi: Every yuan earned is sought to be increased in value. Bank interest is so low that people turn to investing in stocks for dividends, running small businesses, or even lending at high interest rates. In the past, there was only one channel: depositing money in the bank. Now, with more options, people choose the most profitable path. People's commodity awareness has increased, and for the same amount of investment, they seek the maximum benefit, so a large amount of cash circulates in society.

Reporter: It seems that new strategies need to be studied.

### 有钱为什么不愿存银行？

　　有钱为什么不愿存银行？
    本报记者  王艾生
    记者：山西人历来以善聚财著称，可是，现在有些几十年的老储户，也不再往银行存款了，这是什么原因？
    王澜军（太原某贸易公司职员）：这是实情。去年８月份以来，物价涨得太猛，人们存钱不如存物。我家有几千元，去年初，花１８００元买了一部彩电，１８英寸的彩电已涨到２８００至３０００元。现在看来，买对了。
    记者：买了彩电的，当然合算。可是有多少人能够平价买到彩电？有的人见货就买，抢购了些既不紧俏，也不急用的商品，结果成了“负担”，这不也同样不合算吗？
    赵义明（太原市劲松路居民）：去年刮抢购风时，我爱人从银行取出了存的３０００多元，买了两条毛毯，三双皮鞋，两个蚊帐和一个单桶洗衣机。现在看来，毛毯占了点光，其余几件，有的用不上，有的质量太次，还不如把钱存在银行。
    记者：社会上不少手头现金很多的人仍旧宁愿把钱装在自己腰包，也不愿存到银行得利息，这是为什么？
    邵凤岐（太原柳巷塑料皮件厂经理）：说实在的，现在社会上钱最多的，主要是经商的人，捞“外快”的人，他们的钱赚得太容易。我接触的一些个体商贩，几乎没有一个是不靠偷税漏税、玩假弄鬼来挣大钱的。太原柳巷繁华街道，一个摆地摊的，一天收入五六百元。小贩跑一趟去成都的火车，贩一趟香烟，只要不被抓住，六七百元到手。年轻“倒爷”，钱来得容易，花起来就不在乎，抽箭牌烟，喝“五粮液”。下馆子，吃一半，扔一半，挥金如土，你想这样的人，还看得上银行那点儿利息吗？
    记者：这样的人毕竟是少数，多数的个体经营者还是守法的，他们为什么也不愿意把钱存入银行？
    安书文（太原市尖草坪六合清真小吃部）：专业户、个体工商业者……不愿把钱存入银行主要是存取不便，钱在身边，想怎么花就怎么花，想什么时候花，就什么时候花。１月份，我从国营肉食批发部进了十袋带鱼，我们银行的帐上本来有钱，批发单位硬是信不过，支票要倒送，我们只好白白花掉６０元三轮车费。
    王澜军：现在城乡个体经营者的势力不小，无论经营什么行业，都要靠自己寻找进货渠道，不靠国营批发部门。这些人的手头经常有大量的现款，有三万五万，十万八万不在少数。用现金进货，比如到南方购进桔子、广柑等，还比带信汇便宜。搞经营的，就怕把钱存在银行受限制，他们宁愿背着整提箱的现款东奔西跑，也不愿用信汇。
    记者：这就造成人们说的货币“体外循环”？
    张树联（太原市北城城市信用社经理，会计师）：是的。去年秋季以来，出现储蓄滑坡，原因是多方面的：民间现金沉淀太多，个体工商业者、专业户等进行大量的现金交易，国营企业和集体企业在国家银行开户的单位，也不遵守国家现金管理规定，形成大量超限额现金积存、沉淀，一个时期，太原出产的“三关牌”保险柜成为紧俏商品。成千上万个的小金库，小“银行”出现，大大冲击了国家银行的现金回收。开户单位，户头有钱，取不出，他们就更不愿往银行存款了。
    邵凤岐：人们赚来的每一元钱，都想增值，银行利息又那么低，于是就出现入股分红，做小本生意，甚至放高利贷等。过去只有一个渠道：钱存银行。现在搞活，路子多了，怎么有利，就怎么干，人们商品意识浓了，等量的投入，都要追求最大的效益，大量的现金就流在社会上了。
    记者：看来需要研究新对策。
