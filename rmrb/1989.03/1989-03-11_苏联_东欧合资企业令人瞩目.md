The Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries are actively pushing forward with economic reforms within their own countries while accelerating economic cooperation with Western industrialized nations. In the past year, these countries have made significant progress in establishing joint ventures. Their main approaches are as follows:

First, seize the opportunity and accelerate the pace. In 1988, East-West relations further eased, and while countries actively sought political dialogue, they also strengthened bilateral and multilateral economic exchanges, developing relations between the European Economic Community and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), using economic cooperation to promote further political easing. The Soviet Union and some Eastern European socialist countries took advantage of this favorable opportunity to establish joint ventures through various channels and methods. Currently, over 300 joint ventures have been established.

The speed at which the Soviet Union has established joint ventures is particularly noteworthy. By the end of 1988, the Soviet Union had established 160 joint ventures with 27 countries worldwide, including over 90 with Western countries, compared to just 7 the previous year. Hungary was the first Eastern European socialist country to establish joint ventures with the West. In 1988, Hungary's joint ventures with the West doubled, reaching over 200. Additionally, Bulgaria has approximately 15, Romania 5, Poland 3 to 5, and Czechoslovakia over 10. These joint ventures cover industries such as manufacturing, agriculture, commerce, and tourism.

Second, expedite legislation to enhance the attractiveness to foreign investors. In December 1988, the Soviet Council of Ministers adopted the "Decision on Further Developing the Foreign Economic Activities of State Enterprises, Cooperatives, and Other Public Enterprises, Joint Ventures, and Organizations," simplifying the procedures for establishing joint ventures and improving the investment environment. The Soviet Union requires joint ventures to operate on a fully economic accounting basis, be self-sufficient, and self-financing, allowing the chairman or general manager of joint ventures to be foreign citizens. Joint ventures have broad powers in import-export business, setting product prices, and signing contracts.

The Federal Assembly of Czechoslovakia passed the "Joint Venture Law" in November 1988, removing the restriction that foreign capital in joint ventures could not exceed 49%.

Poland also issued the "Foreign Investment Law" at the end of last year, encouraging foreign companies to establish wholly-owned or joint ventures in Poland, removing the restriction on the proportion of foreign capital in joint ventures, and allowing foreigners to serve as managers of joint ventures. New laws in Hungary allow foreign investors to own 100% of some Hungarian enterprises starting this year, and those holding minority stakes no longer require special government approval. Yugoslavia will also implement a new joint venture law starting this year.

Third, actively prepare for the establishment of free trade zones. The Soviet Union and some Eastern European socialist countries with coastal regions are preparing to utilize their natural geographical advantages to actively establish free trade zones and duty-free zones. It is reported that the Soviet Union plans to establish economic special zones in three regions in the Far East, including Nakhodka, offering preferential policies in tariffs, natural resources, and labor costs. Poland plans to utilize the industrial, commercial, and trade advantages of its coastal cities to establish free trade zones in Szczecin, Gdansk, and Gdynia. Bulgaria also decided to build duty-free free trade zones in the port cities of Vidin and Ruse.

The establishment of joint ventures between the Soviet Union and some Eastern European socialist countries with Western countries helps to address foreign exchange shortages and foreign debt issues, utilize foreign funds to accelerate domestic technological transformation, and absorb advanced Western technology. Of course, there are also some problems in establishing joint ventures, such as Western countries imposing various restrictions on the export of advanced technology, maintaining trade discrimination policies against some countries, and not granting them preferential treatment. Some joint ventures do not show significant economic benefits, and some legal regulations need to be improved. However, due to geographical proximity, Western countries are interested in investing in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. If the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries continue to implement open policies and push forward economic reforms, they will continue to make new progress in establishing joint ventures with the West.

### 苏联  东欧合资企业令人瞩目

    苏联  东欧合资企业令人瞩目
    孙希有
    苏联和东欧社会主义国家在积极推进本国经济改革的同时，加快了同西方工业发达国家经济合作的步伐。在过去的一年里，这些国家在创办合资企业方面的进展尤为明显。它们的主要做法是：
    一、不失时机，加快步伐。１９８８年东西方关系进一步缓和，各国在积极谋求政治对话的同时，注意加强双边和多边经济往来，发展欧洲经济共同体和经互会两大经济组织之间的关系，以经济合作促进政治上的进一步缓和。苏联和一些东欧社会主义国家利用这一有利时机，通过各种途径和方式，加快建立合资企业的步伐。目前，已建立起合资企业３００余家。
    苏联建立合资企业速度之快令人瞩目。到１９８８年底，苏联已同世界上２７个国家建立起１６０家合资企业，其中同西方合资建立的企业有９０多家，而一年前仅有７家。匈牙利是欧洲社会主义国家中同西方建立合资企业最早的国家。在１９８８年，匈牙利同西方建立的合资企业又增加了１倍，目前已逾２００家。此外，保加利亚约有１５家、罗马尼亚５家、波兰３至５家、捷克斯洛伐克１０余家。这些合资企业涉及到工、农、商、旅游业等部门。
    二、加紧立法，增强对外国投资者的吸引力。１９８８年１２月，苏联部长会议通过了“关于进一步发展国营企业、合作社企业和其他公有企业、联合公司和组织的对外经济活动的决定”，简化了建立合资企业的手续，改善了投资环境。苏联要求合资企业实行完全的经济核算、自负盈亏和自筹资金，允许合资企业的董事长或总经理由外国公民担任。合资企业在进出口业务、规定产品价格、签定合同方面具有广泛的权力。
    捷克斯洛伐克联邦议会１９８８年１１月通过的《合资企业法》，取消了合资企业中外国资本不得超过４９％的限制。
    波兰在去年岁尾也颁布了《外资经营活动法》，鼓励外国厂商和公司在波兰建立独资或合资企业，取消合资企业中外国资本所占比重的限制，并允许外国人担任合资企业经理。匈牙利新颁布的法律允许外国投资者从今年起对匈牙利的一些企业拥有全部股权，占少数股权的不再需要政府特别批准。南斯拉夫也将从今年起实施新的合资法。
    三、积极筹建自由贸易区。苏联和一些拥有沿海地带的东欧社会主义国家准备利用自然地理优势，积极筹备建立自由贸易区和无关税区。据报道，苏联准备在远东的纳霍德卡等３个地区建立经济特区，在关税、自然资源和劳动力资源付费方面实行优惠政策。波兰准备利用沿海城市工业、商业、贸易比较发达的优势，在什切青、格但斯克和格丁尼亚筹建免税区。保加利亚也决定在港口城市维丁和鲁塞兴建无关税自由贸易区。
    苏联和一些东欧社会主义国家同西方建立合资企业有利于解决外汇短缺和外债问题，利用外国资金加快本国的技术改造，吸收西方的先进技术。当然，在建立合资企业方面也存在一些问题，如西方国家对出口先进技术实行各种限制，对一些国家仍实行贸易歧视政策，不给优惠国待遇；一些合资企业经济效益不明显，有些法律规定也有待完善。不过，由于地缘关系，西方国家对在苏联、东欧地区投资颇感兴趣，如果苏联、东欧国家继续实行开放政策、推进经济改革，它们在同西方建立合资企业方面将会继续取得新的进展。
