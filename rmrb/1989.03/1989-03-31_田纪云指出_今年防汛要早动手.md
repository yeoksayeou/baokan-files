Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 30th. (Economic Reference News reporter Ye Jianping, Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Peng) Vice Premier and Commander-in-Chief of the State Flood Control Headquarters Tian Jiyun said in the morning of the 28th, after listening to the report of the national urban flood control symposium, that this year's flood control work should start early, be prepared, and ensure that no major problems occur, creating conditions for the rectification and reorganization.

Tian Jiyun pointed out that this year's national flood control focuses on two aspects: first, major rivers and large and medium-sized reservoirs. If major rivers have problems, cities will be the first to be affected, followed by a larger area of rural areas. If large and medium-sized reservoirs have problems, they will also flood cities, with unimaginable consequences. Second, the construction of large and medium-sized cities and urban flood control projects must go hand in hand. If flood control projects are not built, no matter how good the city construction is, it will all be destroyed once the flood comes.

Tian Jiyun pointed out that in the future, urban flood control work must strictly implement the mayor's responsibility system. Each city must have a capable working team to handle daily flood control work. Flood control funds should be managed locally, with some funds coming from local finance and some raised from beneficiary units. For places with particular difficulties in flood control funds, the state can provide appropriate support.

Tian Jiyun pointed out that river dredging and detention areas must be seriously implemented. For those who have built new projects in already cleared rivers, strict measures must be taken. Permanent construction is not allowed in detention areas.

　　田纪云指出        
    今年防汛要早动手
    据新华社北京３月３０日电  （《经济参考》报记者叶建平、新华社记者赵鹏）国务院副总理、国家防汛总指挥部总指挥田纪云２８日上午在听取全国城市防洪座谈会情况汇报时说，今年防汛工作要及早动手，有备无患，务必不出大问题，为搞好治理整顿创造条件。
    田纪云指出，今年全国防汛重点是两个方面：一是大江大河、大中型水库。大江大河如果出问题，首当其冲的是城市，其次是更大面积的农村。大中型水库一旦出问题，要冲毁城市，后果也不堪设想。二是大中型城市的城市建设与城市防洪工程建设必须同步，如果不搞防洪工程建设，城市建设再好，洪水一来，都将毁于一旦。
    田纪云指出，今后在城市防洪工作中要坚决实行市长负责制，各市一定要有个精悍的工作班子，抓日常防汛工作。防汛经费各地自理，可以由地方财政拿一部分，从受益单位筹集一部分。对于防洪经费特别有困难的地方，国家可以重点适当加以扶持。
    田纪云指出，河道清障、滞洪区的工作要认真抓好，凡是在已清好的河道中又重新搞建设的，要采取严厉的措施处理，滞洪区内不能再搞永久性建设。
