Title: Seriously Implementing the "Three Linkages" Policy for Grain

The "three linkages" policy, which ties grain procurement tasks to advance payments, fertilizers, and diesel, is well-known among rural residents. However, this work has some drawbacks. Based on the situation in Xinan Town in our county over the past few years, the main issues are as follows:

Many farmers do not receive their grain advance payments on time and in full. In Xinan Town, 11.1% of villages have not received their grain advance payments, 16.7% have used the payments to purchase state bonds or offset agricultural taxes, and 22.2% have used them to develop village-run enterprises. Only 44.4% of grain farmers have actually received their grain advance payments.

Fertilizers are in short supply, and there is serious layer-by-layer retention. Xinan Town should distribute 393.8 tons of bonus-sale fertilizers annually, but the town government retains 3.8%, the village retains 2.3%, and the production team retains 2%. Coupled with the tight supply of fertilizers and the lack of supply during the fertilizing season, many bonus-sale fertilizer tickets expire and become invalid. Farmers have no choice but to purchase high-priced fertilizers.

Bonus-sale diesel is withheld. Out of the 18 villages in the entire town with grain procurement tasks, only 9 villages have actually distributed the bonus-sale diesel according to the policy, amounting to 5.25 tons.

We hope that leaders at all levels will, while focusing on grain production in rural areas, seriously implement and enforce the "three linkages" policy. They should also investigate and address various improper practices that have emerged in the "three linkages" work.

### 认真落实粮食“三挂钩”政策

　　认真落实粮食“三挂钩”政策
    粮食定购任务与定金、化肥、柴油“三挂钩”，在农村可谓家喻户晓。实际上，这项工作却存在一些弊端，从我县新安镇近几年的情况看，主要有以下几种：
    许多农民不能按时、如数拿到粮食预购定金。新安镇未领取到粮食预购定金的村占１１．１％，用粮食预购定金购买国库券和抵交农业税款的占１６．７％，用粮食预购定金发展村办企业的占２２．２％。真正拿到粮食预购定金的粮农只占４４．４％。
    化肥紧缺，层层截留情况严重。新安镇一年应发放奖售化肥３９３．８吨，但镇政府截留３．８％，村里截留２．３％，组里截留２％。加上化肥货源紧张，用肥时节无货供应，因此过期作废的奖售化肥票不少。农民只好硬着头皮购买高价化肥。
    克扣奖售柴油。全镇１８个村有粮食定购任务，按政策应发放奖售柴油５．２５吨，但真正把奖售柴油发给农民的只有９个村。
    希望各级领导同志在抓好农村粮食生产的同时，切实抓好“三挂钩”政策的贯彻、落实，认真查处“三挂钩”工作中出现的各种不正之风。
