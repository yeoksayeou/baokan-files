	Vying for Spring
		Du Yunxie

	Everyone is in such a hurry
		Eager to drink in as much spring rain and spring breeze as possible
		Calmly exposing their own pursuits
		Pushing and shoving in the green thicket
		Stretching their branches out to the most prominent places
		Using the most vibrant flowers to attract
		The picky passersby who point and comment
		River water is most sensitive to the warming air
		Already thawed and flowing
		Wave after wave
		Endlessly speaking
		The language of spring
		Encountering obstacles like rocks
		Splashes up sparkling droplets of debate
		Pushing and pulling, rushing forward
		The clever young birds
		Have already taken to the skies first
		Each one claiming a piece of cloud, circling around
		Lovers and poets
		With eyes that seem to open for the first time
		Full of inspiration, full of words
		The most aloof, the most timid
		Suddenly all harbor competitive spirits
		Every heart is filled with fluttering hopes
		Leaning by the window, gazing into the distance
		Excitedly discussing new ideas, new breakthroughs
		Wanting to go to the seaside, to witness the vast and wondrous ocean
		Even that dark world is unusually active
		Under the dead leaves, the damp black soil
		Nurtures both lovely new life
		And the evil beaks
		Sucking in the spring breeze and spring rain
		Eagerly planning new epidemics
		But the vitality of spring is focused on competition
		The newly gained abundant energy
		Loves the bustling exhibition-like atmosphere

　　争春
    杜运燮
    谁都那么急急忙忙
    想尽快多喝点春雨春风
    坦然裸露着各自的追求
    挤来挤去，在丛绿中
    争把枝条伸到明显处
    用最水灵的花朵吸引
    指指点点的爱挑剔的行人
    河水对气流转暖最敏感
    早已抢先解冻
    一轮又一轮
    滔滔不绝地畅说
    春天的语言
    遇见挡路的石头
    还飞溅起耀眼的争议水花
    推推拉拉着一个劲儿向前奔
    机灵的年轻鸟群
    也早就争先飞上高空
    各恋上一片云，在转圈
    情侣和诗人们
    睁着像是第一次睁开的眼睛
    灵感最多，话也最多
    最清高的，最胆小的
    也忽然都萌发了竞争心
    一颗颗心都装着扑腾的希望
    倚窗远眺
    激动地谈论新观念，新突破
    想去海边，见识大洋的广阔神奇
    那个阴暗的世界也格外活跃
    枯叶下的黑湿泥土
    孕育可爱的新生命
    也孕育罪恶的尖嘴
    吮吸春风春雨
    争先策划新的流行病
    但春的生命力专注于竞争
    新获得的丰沛活力
    就喜爱展销会般的闹哄哄
    　　　　　一九八九年春
