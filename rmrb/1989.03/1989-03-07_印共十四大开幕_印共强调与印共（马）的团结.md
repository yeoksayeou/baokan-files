	The 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of India (CPI) opened today in Calcutta.

	In his opening speech, CPI General Secretary Rajendra Prasad Rao said that the world situation is shifting from confrontation to dialogue. He pointed out that the recent visit of Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to China and his talks with Chinese leaders have opened up the possibility of resolving issues between these two ancient countries and re-establishing friendly relations.

	Rao believed that the domestic situation in India is "critical."

	It is estimated that the congress will discuss the issue of unity between the CPI and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M). Deputy General Secretary Indrajit Gupta told reporters over the weekend that dialogue between the two organizations is important for clarifying their common points and differences. He emphasized that the changing political situation in India requires a united communist movement.

	About 1,200 representatives from India attended the congress. Representatives from 40 foreign communist parties, including those from China and the Soviet Union, also attended the meeting. The congress is expected to conclude on March 12.

　　印共十四大开幕
    印共强调与印共（马）的团结
    新华社加尔各答３月６日电  印度共产党第１４次全国代表大会今天在这里开幕。
    印度共产党总书记拉·拉奥在开幕式上说，世界形势正在从对抗转变为对话。他指出，印度总理拉·甘地最近访华时和中国领导人进行的会谈为解决亚洲和世界这两个古老国家之间的问题、再次建立友好关系开辟了可能。
    拉奥总书记认为，印度国内的局势是“危急”的。
    人们估计，大会上要涉及印度共产党和印度共产党（马）的团结问题。印共副总书记英·古普塔在上周末对记者说，这两个组织的对话对搞清它们的共同点和分歧是很重要的。他强调，印度政治局势的变化需要一个团结的共产主义运动。
    印度的１２００名代表出席了大会。来自中国和苏联等４０个外国共产党的代表也出席了会议。大会预计在３月１２日结束。
