Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, March 11th — Afforestation experts Wang Xingyan, Wang Youmin, and Professor Xue Dezai from Northwest Forestry University told reporters that to achieve real results in China's afforestation efforts and change the situation of "planting trees but not seeing forests," it is necessary to eradicate the "wind of exaggeration."

The three experts have long been engaged in forestry research and are familiar with the situation of afforestation. They said that the results of afforestation cannot be judged solely by the attitudes of leaders. The more people mobilized and the higher the targets set do not necessarily mean better afforestation results. Only by seeing the actual survival rate the following year can a conclusion be drawn. According to statistics, in the 35 years since the founding of the nation, the reported afforestation area nationwide was 1.37 billion mu, but the actual preserved area is only 4.2 billion mu. Each year, about half of the reported afforestation area nationwide is false, and the survival rate of the other half of the afforestation area is only 40%. Thus, the actual surviving area is about one-fifth of the originally reported number. No wonder the masses say: "Dig a hole, plant a stick, next year it's just a bare patch."

The professors analyzed that leaders' satisfaction with "big mobilizations" is the main cause of this situation. Each year, the higher authorities set overly large tasks, and when these tasks are implemented at the grassroots level, they are further inflated. When local areas cannot complete the tasks, they have no choice but to engage in deception. In a certain forest farm in a county in Shaanxi Province, the actual reported survival rate of afforestation was 60%, but the county leaders found that it did not reach the national standard of 85%, so they found an excuse to have it re-investigated, raising the survival rate to 86%. Additionally, insufficient national investment in afforestation is another cause of the wind of exaggeration. Afforestation subsidies are allocated based on the size of the completed tasks, and reporting more allows for more subsidies. In some counties in the northwest, based on the reported afforestation numbers over the years, they could cover the local barren hills several times, but they are still receiving subsidies, and the barren hills remain unchanged. In northern Shaanxi, a village with over 100 mu of barren hills has been afforesting every year for 12 years, but still, there are no trees.

To quickly stop this harmful wind of exaggeration, the professors suggest that first, leaders should establish a pragmatic style of work, determining afforestation tasks based on actual financial, labor, and technical capabilities. Appropriately increase investment in afforestation construction. Afforestation should be listed as one of the major measures for land rehabilitation, changing the assessment methods, and making the actual afforestation and survival rate the sole indicator for assessment and rewards. Regular inspections of afforestation completion should be conducted, and if there are false reports, they should be seriously dealt with. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the forestry technical team. Afforestation personnel should have a certain level of professionalism, implementing task division and contract responsibility, and establishing reward and punishment standards.

### 层层加任务　基层大呼隆  每年造林成活面积八成虚报  专家呼吁实事求是痛戒浮夸

　　层层加任务　基层大呼隆
    每年造林成活面积八成虚报  专家呼吁实事求是痛戒浮夸
    据新华社西安３月１１日电 （记者景杰敏）西北林业学院造林专家王性炎、王佑民教授和薛德自副教授对记者说，要使我国的植树造林取得实实在在的成绩，改变“造林不见林”的状况，必须痛戒“浮夸风”。
    这三位专家一直从事林学研究，对植树造林的情况比较熟悉。他们说，造林成果不能只看领导的表态，并不是出动的人越多，提出的指标越高造林成果就越大，只有看到来年实际成活率后，才能作出结论。据统计，建国３５年中，全国上报造林面积是１３．７亿亩，经调查，保存面积仅４．２亿亩。每年全国上报造林面积约有一半是虚的，另一半造林面积中成活率也只有４０％，这样，实际成活面积约为原上报数的五分之一。难怪群众说：“挖坑坑，栽杆杆，来年是个光板板”。
    教授分析说，领导满足于“大呼隆”是造成这种状况的主要原因。每年上边要求任务都过大，任务落实到基层，又层层加码，各地完不成，只好弄虚作假。陕西省某县一林场，原如实上报造林的成活率为６０％，县领导发现未达到国家规定８５％的指标，就找借口让其重新调查，将成活率提高到８６％。另外，国家造林投资不足也是造成浮夸风的一个原因。造林拨款是按完成任务大小来定的，多报就能多拿补贴。西北一些县，按历年上报造林数，可以把当地荒山坡覆盖好几遍，但至今仍领补贴，荒山依旧。陕北有个村１００多亩荒坡地上，年年造林，造了１２年，至今仍不见林。
    为了尽快制止这种误国误民的浮夸风，教授们建议，首先领导要树立实事求是的作风，根据实际财力、劳力和技术力量确定造林任务。适当增加造林建设的投资。把造林列为整治国土的重大措施之一，要改变考核办法，把造林、实际成活率作为考核、奖励的唯一指标，要定期核查造林完成的情况，如有不实，应严肃处理。其次，要充实林业技术队伍，造林人员应具有一定专业水平，实行任务分片包干，制定奖罚标准。
