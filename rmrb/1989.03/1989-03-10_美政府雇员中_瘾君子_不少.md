According to a report by the Washington Post today, a random sample survey of over 30,000 government employees in the past two and a half years revealed that 203 of them were drug users. Among them, 60 were air traffic controllers, 42 worked in the security departments for nuclear and chemical weapons, and some were officials responsible for enforcing drug laws.

According to federal government regulations, anyone found to be using drugs can be immediately dismissed. However, relevant departments in the U.S. government actually only adopt a policy of probation, requiring drug users to quit within one year.

　　美政府雇员中“瘾君子”不少
    新华社华盛顿３月８日电  据《华盛顿邮报》今天报道，在过去两年半里对３万多名政府雇员进行随意抽样调查，发现吸毒者竟达２０３人之多，其中６０人是空中控制人员，４２人在核武器和化学武器保安部门服务，还有一些人本身就是执行禁毒法规的官员。
    按照联邦政府规定，凡验明有吸毒行为者，可以立即除名，但美国政府有关部门实际上只采取留用察看办法，要求吸毒者一年内戒除这种恶习。
