Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 4th.

The Central Committee of the China Revolutionary Committee (Minzhugonghehui) held a symposium in Beijing on March 3rd and 4th. The meeting discussed and explored the issue of upholding and improving the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party.

Many committee members believe that the People's Congress system, the political consultation system, and the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party are fundamental institutions in China's political system and are also the basic political landscape of China. They are historically formed and are in line with China's national conditions and must be upheld. They pointed out that with the progress of political system reform, this system will continue to improve and develop.

The committee members believe that the current task is to make more efforts in upholding and improving this system, rather than changing the fundamental political system and basic political landscape. Some committee members pointed out that currently, a small number of people in the country advocate for Western-style "multi-party system," advocating for opposition parties and rotational governance, which is not in line with China's national conditions and is not advisable.

The committee members also discussed how to lead, how to cooperate, how to participate in politics, how to supervise, and how to further leverage the advantages of the China Revolutionary Committee in the process of political participation and consultation to contribute to the promotion of national reunification. They made many suggestions.

Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Revolutionary Committee, Zhu Xuefan, presided over the symposium and gave concluding remarks.

　　民革中央座谈会提出
    坚持共产党领导的多党合作
    新华社北京三月四日电  民革中央在京的常务委员和中央监察委员会常务委员，昨天和今天举行了座谈会，就坚持和完善共产党领导的多党合作制问题，进行了广泛的探讨。
    许多委员认为，人民代表大会制度、政治协商制度和共产党领导的多党合作制度，是我国政治体制中的根本制度，也是我国的基本政治格局。它是历史形成的，也是符合我国国情的，必须坚持。他们指出，随着政治体制改革的进展，这个制度将不断完善、发展。
    委员们认为，目前的任务是要在坚持和完善方面多作努力，而绝不是改变根本政治制度和基本政治格局。有的委员指出，当前，国内有极少数人鼓吹西方所谓“多党制”，搞反对党，搞轮流执政，这是不符合我国国情的，是不可取的。
    委员们还就如何领导、如何合作、如何参政、如何监督，以及民革在参政议政过程中如何进一步发挥自己的优势，为促进祖国统一贡献力量等方面，提出不少建议。
    民革中央主席朱学范主持了座谈会，并在最后讲话。
