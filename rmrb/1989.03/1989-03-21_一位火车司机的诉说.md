A Train Driver's Lament

Shi Fu, a locomotive driver from the Jiamusi Locomotive Depot of the Harbin Railway Bureau, driver of locomotive number 2555, and a delegate to the 7th National People's Congress, has a lot to say in response to the People's Daily's discussion on how to quickly change the lagging situation in transportation. Here it is:

I have been working with locomotives since I was 18, and it has been 31 years now. Back then, driving a locomotive with a big red flower was a matter of pride, and others envied it. Decades have passed, from the Great Leap Forward to the "Great Chaos," and finally to the "Great Order." Especially after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, with the deepening of reforms, the economy has taken off, all industries have flourished, and there is a vibrant atmosphere. However, at this critical moment of modern industrial development, as the "vanguard" of railway transportation, it is relatively backward, accidents occur frequently, and it seriously drags down the development of the national economy. Is it really a vanguard? As a locomotive driver who has been working on the transportation front line for a long time, apart from feeling ashamed, I really have a lot to say...

The locomotives are outdated, and they are overloaded, making the locomotives start to struggle.

Taking the Jiamusi Railway Bureau as an example: within the jurisdiction of the three locomotive depots, there are a total of 173 locomotives, all of which are steam locomotives. Among them, 72 are over 20 years old, accounting for 41%; 79 are over 10 years old, accounting for 45.9%; and 22 are less than 10 years old, accounting for 12.9%. However, the transportation tasks are heavy, with an annual cargo volume of 32.9 million tons and 18.4 million passengers. The transportation volume per locomotive is as high as 27.41 million tons.

To ensure that the trains run on time and do not derail, they have to speed up the turnover, reduce the parking time, and organize the tight schedule on the line. The shortest parking time is only 27 minutes. Where is there any time for maintenance? Even refueling and watering are done on the tight schedule.

Due to the long-term operation of the locomotives in poor condition and overloading, accidents have increased, seriously threatening transportation safety. In 1988, locomotive quality accidents accounted for 35%. No wonder the big cars say that the locomotives from the 1950s are struggling to handle the transportation volume of the 1980s.

As the "two legs" of the railway, the quality of the railway lines has seriously declined, aging is severe, hidden dangers are increasing, and they are constantly threatening the safety of train operation and personal safety, and they can no longer serve us.

Most of the lines and bridges within the jurisdiction of the Jiamusi Railway Bureau are located in mountainous areas, with 90% built during the Japanese puppet regime. The design standards are low, with light, old, and mixed steel rails coexisting with poor-quality roadbeds. Among every five bridges, one is a defective bridge! The proportion of old rails in use on the main lines is large, and they have been in service for a long time, with serious damage. In 1987, 2,878 rails were damaged. In recent years, although a certain number of major repair projects have been arranged each year, due to limited funds, they can only offset the increase in defective equipment each year. Although in 1988, after the safety work meetings at the State Council and the Ministry of Railways, some investments were increased and some equipment was improved, it is far from being able to fundamentally change the current situation of lines and bridges. There are still 252 kilometers of light, old, and mixed rails on the main lines within the jurisdiction, bearing the heavy pressure of the wheels day and night.

Railway workers who are used to living in poverty have a kind of fighting spirit. To ensure the smooth flow of the main arteries, they adopt measures such as extending working hours, increasing workload, increasing patrol shifts, and closely monitoring key sections day and night to fight against various natural and man-made disasters. A bureau with 30,000 employees has participated in 780,000 rescue, disaster relief, flood control, and snow removal activities in the past three years. In 1988, 198 rail fracture accidents were prevented.

Although rail fractures, roadbed collapses, and line slips were prevented from causing major accidents, the risk index is rising, and it is worrying to think that one day the train might derail and people might die.

On the one hand, they are under spiritual and economic pressure, and on the other hand, they are punished by overloading. The train is getting heavier and heavier.

In recent years, in order to expand social benefits, the railway department has focused on internal potential, increasing the traction tonnage from 1,700 tons to 2,300, 2,700, and 3,000 tons. The Jiafu Line and the Suijia Line both pull 3,300 tons. In just 1987 and 1988, the overloading alone increased the transportation of goods by 3.69 million tons.

However, the joy of contribution has not washed away their spiritual dust, nor can it help them get out of their current predicament. The heavier the burden, the more they are punished. The locomotive drivers, who were once proud to be called "big cars," have lost their former glory.

"Working hard for a shift is not as good as selling a pack of cigarettes at home." The earnings of a fireman for one shift, after deducting meals, are equivalent to the earnings from selling a pack of foreign cigarettes.

The contributions of a "big car" go unnoticed, but everyone knows about their personal income. Girls are no longer as enthusiastic about them as before. As soon as they hear that they work on the railway driving trains, they simply don't want to meet them and say "bye-bye."

In the past, people would go all out to work on the railway and drive trains, but now they have to ask others to help them transfer. In a train crew of 210 people, 189 have applied for a transfer, accounting for 90%.

On the one hand, they are under double pressure from the spirit and economy; on the other hand, they are punished by overloading. An old bureau chief who has retired to the second line says vividly that the railway is like an old man carrying a burden and walking, the heavier he walks. Facing the great development of modern industry and the "main artery" that is not in line with it, it is time to make a decision to solve the serious lagging problem of railway transportation!

### 一位火车司机的诉说……

专栏：如何尽快改变滞后局面？——交通运输总是讨论

　　一位火车司机的诉说……
    石富，哈尔滨铁路局佳木斯机务段２５５５号机车司机长，七届全国人大代表，本报开展交通运输问题讨论《如何尽快改变滞后局面》，他有很多话要说，请看——
    一位火车司机的诉说……
    我从１８岁开始与火车头“结伴”，至今已３１个春秋了。那时是带着大红花上的机车，自己高兴，就是别人也羡慕极了。几十年过去了，从大跃进发展到“大乱”，大乱终又得到大治。特别是党的十一届三中全会之后，随着改革的不断深入，经济腾飞、百业俱兴、一派生机。然而，在现代工业大发展的关键时刻，作为“先行官”的铁路运输却相形见绌，事故迭出，严重拖了国民经济发展的后腿，先行不先行！作为一名长期工作在运输一线的火车司机，除了感到脸上无光外，也着实有许多话想说……
    机车陈旧，超负荷运转，火车头开始力不从心了。
    仅以佳木斯分局为例：管内三个机务段，共配属机车１７３台，全部是蒸汽机车。其中服役２０年以上的有７２台，占４１％；１０年以上的７９台，占４５．９％；１０年以下的２２台，占１２．９％。而承担的运输任务很重，年货物发送量为３２９０万吨，旅客发送为１８４０万人。机车台运输量高达２７．４１万吨。
    为了保证列车正点不丢线，他们不得不在加速周转，压缩库停时间，组织紧交路上打主意，最短的库停时间仅２７分钟。哪里谈得上检修，就是上煤满水换乘也是“紧交路”。
    由于机车长期带病出征，超负荷运转，事故增多，严重威胁运输安全。１９８８年，机车质量事故就占３５％，难怪大车们说，这５０年代的火车头，对付８０年代的运量，真有点儿力不从心了。
    作为火车“两条腿”的铁路线，质量严重下降，老化严重，隐患骤增，时时刻刻危及着行车和人身安全，已不再为我们作主了。
    佳分局管内大部分线桥设备地处山区，日伪时期修建的占９０％，设计标准低，轻、老、杂型钢轨与劣质路基并存。在每五座桥梁中就有１座失格桥梁！管内正线再用轨比例大，长期超期服役，伤损情况十分严重。１９８７年伤损钢轨就达２８７８根。几年来，虽然每年都安排一定数量的大修项目，但由于费用有限，仅仅能抵消每年失格设备的增加数。尽管１９８８年国务院和铁道部两级安全工作会议之后，增加了一些投资，改善了一部分设备，但远远不能从根本上改变线桥设备现状，管内正线仍有２５２公里轻、老、杂型轨，日日夜夜承受着车轮的重压。
    过惯了穷日子的铁路工人是有那么一股子拚命精神的。为了保证大动脉的畅通无阻，他们采取延长工作时间，上工作量，增加巡检班次，重点区段人盯人，昼夜死看死守的作法，向来自自然的、人为的种种灾害作斗争。一个拥有３万名员工的分局，近三年参加抢险、救灾、抗洪、除雪等突击活动达７８万人次。１９８８年防止因钢轨折损造成的事故１９８件。
    尽管一次次的钢轨折损、路基冲空、线路滑坡等事故被防止，没有酿成大祸。但险情指数上升，不能不让人感到忧虑，谁知哪天车翻人亡呢？
    一方面承受来自精神和经济的压力，一方面是超负荷运转的惩罚，火车越开越“沉”了。
    近几年，为了扩大社会效益，铁路部门眼睛向内，挖掘自身潜力，牵引定数一增再增，由１７００吨增至２３００、２７００、３０００吨，佳富线、绥佳两线均拉３３００吨。仅１９８７、１９８８两年超轴一项就多运货物３６９万吨。
    然而，贡献后的喜悦并没有洗去他们精神上的征尘，更不能使他们摆脱现实中的困境。包袱越背越沉。被人们尊称为“大车”的火车司机，昔日的自豪不见了。
    “辛辛苦苦跑一班，不如在家卖盒烟。”一个司炉一班所得，去掉吃饭，相当于卖一盒外烟所得。
    一位“大车”的贡献无人问津，可个人收入却无人不晓，姑娘们已不再像过去那样热衷于他们了，一听说是铁路开火车的，干脆连见都不想见上一面就“拜拜”了。
    过去是挖空心思上铁路、开火车，眼下是托人说情办调转。一个包车队２１０人中，就有１８９人申请调转，占９０％。
    一方面承受着来自精神和经济的双重重压；另一方面是超负荷运转的惩罚。一位退居二线的老局长形象地说，铁路好比是一位背着包袱跋涉的老人，越走越沉。面对现代工业的大发展和与之不相称的“大动脉”，是到了下决心解决铁路运输严重滞后问题的时候了！
