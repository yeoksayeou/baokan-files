New Singapore's First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that in view of the steps taken by Indonesia to normalize relations with China, Singapore will reconsider its relations with China.

Goh Chok Tong said that Singapore's policy has always been to establish diplomatic relations with China after Indonesia resumes relations with China. Once Indonesia normalizes its relations with China, Singapore will naturally follow suit.

He expressed that establishing diplomatic relations with China is just a matter of time for Singapore. Singapore does not need to hesitate, especially since Singapore's economic relations with China have always been harmonious.

He said that Indonesia's resumption of diplomatic relations with China is a move to make the region more stable.
