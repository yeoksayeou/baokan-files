The Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued "Opinions on Commemorating the 70th Anniversary of the May Fourth Movement."

The "Opinions" state that the May Fourth Movement was a great anti-imperialist patriotic movement and a great new cultural movement against feudalism. It marked the turning point from the old democratic revolution to the new democratic revolution in China. It promoted the liberation of the Chinese people's minds, the spread of Marxism in China, and the birth of the Communist Party of China. Today, as the Chinese people are striving to push forward reform and socialist modernization, commemorating the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement has important practical significance.

The guiding ideology for the commemorative activities is to carry forward the revolutionary and patriotic traditions of the May Fourth Movement, to promote democratic and scientific spirits, to further inspire and unite the strength of the entire nation, and to advance along the path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics under the guidance of the theory and line of the 13th Party Congress, striving for the "Four Modernizations" and the rejuvenation of China.

The "Opinions" point out that the following points should be emphasized during the commemorative activities:

(1) To propagate the historical changes that have occurred in China since the May Fourth Movement and the new historical mission facing the Chinese people. The Communist Party of China, as the backbone of the Chinese revolution, has united all patriotic and progressive forces to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism through arduous struggles. Subsequently, it led the Chinese people to firmly embark on the socialist path. Through the past ten years of reform and opening up, building socialism with Chinese characteristics has become a great and vivid reality in China. Our current task is to adhere to the four cardinal principles, to persist in the general policy and guidelines of reform and opening up, to mobilize the entire nation to work hard, to concentrate our efforts on developing productive forces, and to work together to build a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized country.

(2) To propagate the patriotic spirit of the May Fourth Movement, to inspire and guide people to take the Four Modernizations and reform as their own mission, and to share the fate of the country's prosperity and decline. Patriotism has great cohesive power. The patriots of the May Fourth era rose up to save China and fought bravely to change the fate of our nation. Today's patriotism is concentrated in the love for the cause of socialist modernization, the support for reform and opening up, and the dedication to the rejuvenation of China. Reform is driving the progress of the country, but it also faces many new problems and difficulties. We must resolutely implement the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee to rectify the economic environment, to rectify the economic order, to deepen the reform comprehensively, to overcome the difficulties in the process, to enhance national self-esteem and confidence, to work hard, and to do a good job at our respective posts.

(3) To explain and inherit the scientific and democratic spirits of the May Fourth Movement in accordance with the requirements of the new era. The greatest achievement of the May Fourth New Culture Movement was that the Chinese people chose Marxism. The spread of Marxism in China and its continuous development in combination with Chinese reality are the mainstream of the scientific and democratic spirits since the May Fourth Movement. We must further implement the thought line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, adhere to and develop Marxism, and use this scientific worldview to observe and solve new problems in reform and construction. We must actively and cautiously promote political system reform, build socialist democratic politics, strive to improve the system of people's congresses, the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, and consolidate and develop a stable, united, democratic, and harmonious political situation. We must earnestly implement the policies of the Party and the government to respect knowledge, respect talents, and develop science and education, and strive to improve the overall quality of the nation.

(4) To explain the basic policy of the Party and the government towards Chinese national culture and foreign cultures. We should inherit and promote excellent national culture and should not adopt a nihilistic attitude. We should absorb and develop beneficial foreign cultures and should not mechanically copy them. We should analyze national and foreign cultures historically and scientifically, and should not say that everything bad is absolutely bad or that everything good is absolutely good. We should absorb the essence and discard the dross, neither be arrogant nor self-abased. We should strongly resist the decadent ideas of capitalism and feudalism. We should stand on Chinese soil, face the world, and build a culture that suits socialist modernization.

The entire commemorative activity should be combined with the ongoing ideological education on the current situation. By reviewing history and focusing on reality, we should enhance people's understanding of the Party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and deepen their understanding of the historical necessity, arduousness, and complexity of the reform, so as to make better ideological and theoretical preparations for the reform and construction.

The notice from the Central Propaganda Department also made arrangements for various commemorative activities. A commemorative meeting for the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement will be held in Beijing on May 4. The Central Party History Research Office, the State Education Commission, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and other departments will hold thematic academic seminars. Local and grassroots youth leagues and university student unions will organize various mass commemorative activities.

　　中宣部提出纪念“五四”七十周年意见
    继承革命与爱国传统　发扬民主和科学精神
    凝聚全民族力量为振兴中华而奋斗
    新华社北京３月１８日电  为纪念五四运动７０周年，中共中央宣传部不久前发出《关于纪念五四运动７０周年的意见》。
    《意见》说，五四运动是伟大的反帝爱国运动和伟大的反封建的新文化运动，是我国旧民主主义革命到新民主主义革命的转折点。它促进了我国人民的思想解放，促进了马克思主义在中国的传播，促进了中国共产党的诞生。在我国人民奋力推进改革和社会主义现代化建设的今天，纪念五四运动７０周年，有着重要的现实意义。
    纪念活动的指导思想是：继承“五四”革命传统和爱国主义传统，发扬民主精神和科学精神，进一步激发、凝聚全民族的力量，在党的十三大的理论和路线指引下，沿着建设有中国特色的社会主义道路前进，为“实现四化，振兴中华”而奋斗。
    《意见》指出，在纪念活动中要着重阐述以下几点：
    （１）宣传“五四”以来我国发生的历史巨变和我国人民面临的新的历史使命。中国共产党作为中国革命的中坚，广泛团结一切爱国、进步力量，经过艰苦卓绝的斗争，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的反动统治，接着又领导全国人民坚定地走上了社会主义道路。通过最近十年的改革开放，建设有中国特色的社会主义已经成为我国伟大、生动的现实。我们现在的任务是，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放的总方针、总政策，全民奋起，艰苦奋斗，集中力量发展社会生产力，同心同德地建设富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家。
    （２）宣传五四运动的爱国主义精神，激励和引导人们以四化、改革为己任，与国家兴衰、荣辱共命运。爱国主义具有伟大的凝聚力。“五四”时代的爱国者为拯救中华而奋起，为改变我们民族的命运进行了前仆后继的英勇斗争。现在的爱国主义，集中表现为热爱社会主义现代化事业，拥护改革、开放，为振兴中华而献身。改革正在推动着国家的进步，同时也面临着许多新的问题和困难。我们要坚决按照党的十三届三中全会的方针治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，全面深化改革，克服前进中的困难。要提高民族自尊心、自信心，艰苦创业，做好各自岗位上的工作。
    （３）结合新时期的要求，阐明和继承“五四”的科学精神、民主精神。“五四”新文化运动的最大成果，是中国人民选择了马克思主义。马克思主义在中国的传播和它在同中国实际结合中的不断发展，是“五四”以来科学、民主精神的主流。我们要进一步贯彻解放思想、实事求是的思想路线，坚持和发展马克思主义，运用这个科学的世界观来观察、解决改革和建设中的新问题。要积极而审慎地推进政治体制改革，建设社会主义民主政治，努力完善人民代表大会制度、共产党领导的多党合作制度和政治协商制度，巩固和发展安定、团结、民主、和谐的政治局面。要认真贯彻党和政府尊重知识、尊重人才和发展科学、振兴文化教育的方针政策，努力提高全民族的素质。
    （４）阐明党和政府对我国民族文化和外来文化的基本方针。对优秀的民族文化，要继承、弘扬，不能采取虚无主义态度。对有益的外来文化，要吸收、发展，不能生吞活剥地照搬照套。对民族文化和外来文化，都要作历史的科学的分析，不能说坏就是绝对的坏、一切皆坏，也不能说好就是绝对的好、一切皆好，而要吸取精华，剔除糟粕，既不妄自尊大，也不妄自菲薄。要有力地抵制资本主义和封建主义的腐朽思想。我们要立足中国，面向世界，建设与社会主义现代化相适应的文化。
    整个纪念活动要注意同当前正在进行的形势教育结合起来。回顾历史，着眼现实，提高人们对十一届三中全会以来党的路线、方针、政策的认识，增进对改革的历史必然性和艰巨性、复杂性的理解，为改革和建设进一步做好思想、理论上的准备。
    中央宣传部的通知还就开展各种纪念活动作了安排。５月４日将在北京召开五四运动７０周年纪念大会。中央党史研究室、国家教委、团中央、社科院等部门将召开专题学术讨论会。地方、基层团委和大专院校学生会将组织多种多样的群众性纪念活动。
