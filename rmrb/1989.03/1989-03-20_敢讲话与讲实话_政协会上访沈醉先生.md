On the morning of the opening ceremony of the Second Session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, we met with Mr. Shen Kui.

He looked very healthy and laughed heartily. He told us that over the past year, he had received more than 80 groups of friends from Taiwan, reminiscing and chatting together very harmoniously. Some of his friends from Taiwan did not understand the political life on the mainland. Once, a friend's first words upon meeting him were: "How do you feel after living under the suppression of the Communist Party for so many years?" He jokingly replied: "Do you see me so healthy and spirited, looking like someone who is suppressed? I don't feel suppressed, and I even dare to give suggestions." He took out a reply from the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and showed it to his friend, saying: "Look, I gave suggestions to the Communist Party, and I immediately got a response. Later, it was also reflected in the documents."

Mr. Shen sincerely told us: "Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the CPC, I have become bolder and dare to speak, which is also out of a sense of responsibility to the country and the people." He wrote an article for the People's Daily last year, titled "Message to the New Leadership Team," proposing that leaders should govern well and rectify the style of work, and should do so by "putting the happiness of the people before their own." He told us: "I will also raise this issue at this meeting." He then talked about how during the three years of natural disasters, the people had no complaints and worked together with the Party to overcome difficulties. But today, why do people complain even though they have color TVs, refrigerators, and an improved standard of living? This is a problem worth pondering. It also shows that although our policies are good, cadres have discounted them in execution, and the style of work is not correct.

Mr. Shen said: "Now the central authorities are advocating clean governance. Some people propose to use money to promote clean governance. I think we cannot completely rely on using money to promote clean governance. We should also advocate the traditional virtues of the Chinese people and promote clean governance through frugality. Our country is large, with a large population and a weak foundation. Our public servants should have the traditional spirit of thrift. From the central to the local levels, leading by example, the people's hearts will be at ease, and there will be fewer complaints. We are all in the same boat, and the leaders should take the lead. If everyone competes in living standards, it will not work for our national conditions today."

Perhaps because we are reporters, Mr. Shen talked about the truth-seeking and propaganda art in his book-writing experience. In his book "Prisoner Reform: Observations" (published and distributed in Hong Kong), he used many true stories from the reform of prisoners in those years, reflecting the policy and real situation of our country's reform of prisoners at that time, which is said to be very popular among readers. For example, there is a small episode in which Mr. Huang Wei once broke a milk bottle. People saw it and realized that the prisoners in the reform camp drank milk at that time. He said, "Propaganda should grasp people's psychology. It is the best strategy to have people help you spread your message; it is a medium strategy to have people read it without commenting; if people don't even want to look at it, that is a low or wrong strategy." This passage is very enlightening to us.

　　敢讲话与讲实话
    ——政协会上访沈醉先生
    本报记者  晓渡
    全国政协七届二次会议举行开幕式的那天上午，我们见到沈醉先生。
    他气色很好，爽朗地笑着。他告诉我们，一年多来，他接待过８０多批台湾朋友，一起叙旧谈心，非常融洽。有的台湾朋友对大陆的政治生活很不理解，有一次，一位朋友见面的第一句话：“你在共产党的压抑下生活了这么多年，感觉如何？”他诙谐地回答说：“你看我这么健康，这么精神，像受压抑的样子吗？”“我没感觉受压抑，而且还敢于提意见呢。”他拿出一件中共中央办公厅给他的回函对他的朋友说：“你看，我给中共提意见，立即得到答复，以后在文件里还反映出来了。”
　　
    沈先生坦诚地对我们说：“中共十一届三中全会以来，我胆子大了，敢讲话了，这也是出于对祖国、对人民的责任感。”他去年曾给《人民日报》写过一篇文章，题目是《寄语新的领导班子》，提出领导要当好政，要正风气，就要做到“后天下之乐而乐”。他告诉我们：“这次会上我还要提这个问题。”他由此谈到，三年自然灾害时，老百姓没有怨言，一心一德与党共渡难关。而今天，为什么有了彩电，有了冰箱，生活提高了，还骂骂咧咧，这个问题是很值得深思的。这也说明我们制定的政策虽好，干部在执行上打了折扣，风气不正。
    沈先生说：“现在中央提倡廉政，有的人提出要以钱养廉。我认为也不能完全讲以钱养廉，还要提倡弘扬中国人的美德，以俭养廉。我们国家大，人口多，底子薄，我们的公务人员应该有传统的勤俭风气，从中央到地方，上行下效，群众心里就会舒坦，怨言也会少。同舟共济，领导要带头。如果都在生活上攀比，对我们今天的国情来说，是不行的。”
    也许因为我们是记者，沈先生以他写书的经历，讲到了宣传上的实事求是和宣传艺术。他在《战犯改造所见闻》（香港出版发行）这本书里，用了许多当年战犯改造的真实故事，反映了当年我们国家改造战犯的政策和真实状况，据说很受读者欢迎。比如其中有一个小情节——黄维先生有一次摔了牛奶瓶子。人家看了，才知道，原来当年的战犯在改造所里还喝牛奶呢。他说，“宣传要掌握人们的心理，你的材料让人帮你去讲是上策；让人看了不作声是中策；如果人家看也不想看，那就是下策或失策了。”这一段话，对我们很有启发。
