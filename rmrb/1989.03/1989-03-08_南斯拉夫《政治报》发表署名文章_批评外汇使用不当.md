	Yugoslav "Politika" today published a signed article stating that the improper use of foreign exchange is one of the reasons for Yugoslavia's current economic difficulties.

	The article points out that since the war, Yugoslavia has obtained over $1,000 billion in foreign exchange, including more than $300 billion in aid from the United States before 1964 and $500 billion earned by Yugoslav workers temporarily employed abroad. However, the aid received before the 1970s has been completely spent, and the money obtained from the United States accounted for 60% of the country's international payments deficit. Since the 1970s, Yugoslavia has had no aid to rely on, resulting in $20 billion in foreign debt.

	The article states that Yugoslavia has used borrowed funds even worse than the aid, with $80 billion wasted on failed investments. Once Yugoslavia could no longer borrow money from abroad, the crisis began to escalate.

	Most Yugoslav economic experts believe that the major errors in the country's development policy are mainly due to political factors controlling the economy. In recent years, politicians have also begun to accept this view.

　　南斯拉夫《政治报》发表署名文章
    批评外汇使用不当
    新华社贝尔格莱德３月６日电  南斯拉夫《政治报》今天发表的一篇署名文章认为，对外汇使用不当是造成南斯拉夫目前经济困难的原因之一。
    文章指出，南斯拉夫战后以来获得的外汇总计１０００多亿美元，其中包括１９６４年以前从美国获得的３００多亿美元的无偿援助和南斯拉夫在国外临时就业的工人挣回的５００亿美元。但是，在７０年代以前得到的无偿援助已全部花光，从美国获得的钱弥补了南国际收支逆差的６０％。从７０年代起南没有无偿援助可依靠了，结果欠下外债２００亿美元。
    文章说，南斯拉夫借的贷款比无偿援助使用得更糟，仅失误的投资就花去８０亿美元。一旦南斯拉夫从国外借不到钱时，危机开始升级。
    南斯拉夫大多数经济专家认为，国家发展政策中所犯的重大错误，主要是因为政治因素控制经济所造成。近几年来，政治家也开始接受这一观点。
