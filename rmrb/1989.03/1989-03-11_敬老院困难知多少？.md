The county's Civil Affairs Bureau recently inspected all 38 township and village-run nursing homes in the county. The overall situation is good, but there are also some problems.

First, the grain rations and living expenses for the elderly in the nursing homes are overdue. For example, the Wangduo Township Nursing Home has 8 elderly residents. Since the home was established in 1983, 6 villages in this township have continuously owed the nursing home grain rations totaling 2,110 kilograms and living expenses amounting to 3,230 yuan. The nursing home has repeatedly reported this to the township government, but the issue remains unresolved.

Second, the living standards of the Five Guarantees elderly have declined. Currently, the annual living allowance for a Five Guarantees elderly person is between 280 and 300 yuan. This standard was set in the second half of last year when the price of rice was 0.8 yuan per kilogram, vegetable oil was 3.2 yuan per kilogram, and priced coal was 80 yuan per ton. Since then, the prices of these items have all increased. Last year, the elderly in the nursing homes could eat pork once every five days, but now they can barely manage once every ten days.

Third, the financial accounts of the nursing homes urgently need to be rectified. Many nursing homes have chaotic financial records, with frequent instances of underreporting, misreporting, and omissions.

To improve the nursing homes, relevant departments need to pay more attention.

### 敬老院困难知多少？

　　敬老院困难知多少？
    我县民政局最近检查了全县３８所乡镇及村办敬老院，总的情况是好的，但也存在一些问题。
    一、拖欠敬老院老人的口粮和生活费。如王垛乡敬老院有８位老人，自１９８３年建院以来，这个乡有６个村连续多年拖欠敬老院老人的口粮２１１０公斤，生活费３２３０元。敬老院多次向乡政府反映，但一直得不到解决。
    二、五保老人的生活水平有所下降。目前，一个五保老人全年生活费是２８０元至３００元。这个标准是去年下半年确定的，当时大米每公斤０．８元，菜油每公斤３．２元，议价煤每吨８０元。后来，这些物品的价格都上涨了。敬老院的老人去年每５天能吃一次猪肉，现在１０天也吃不上一次。
    三、敬老院财务帐目亟待整顿。不少敬老院的财务帐目混乱，少记、错记、漏记的现象屡有发生。
    办好敬老院，还需要有关部门多操点心。
