Recently, in the main bustling areas of our city—such as Nan Station, Beifang Dasha near Zhongjie, the Liaoning Industrial Exhibition Hall, and the Cultural Road Overpass—fortune-tellers have been increasingly appearing. They gather in groups, choosing locations with convenient transportation and heavy foot traffic, offering services like drawing lots, face reading, and palmistry. These individuals are mostly farmers from the suburbs of our city and nearby counties, or unemployed individuals. A few come from other provinces. They include both young people and middle-aged to elderly individuals, with many being illiterate or semi-literate.

From our observations, these fortune-tellers have formed a kind of industry organization. Within the organization, there are typically leaders, employees, and assistants, with clear definitions of each person's rights and responsibilities. They also have clear regulations and divisions for the prices of business locations. Without permission from this industry organization, one cannot arbitrarily set up a stall to do business. We witnessed a fortune-teller from Heilongjiang who had just set up his stall and was immediately stopped by a young man who confiscated his tools. After repeated pleas, he was allowed to continue his work, but he had to pay 10 yuan in rent before nightfall.

We also discovered that the "fortune-telling industry" has a phenomenon of recruiting apprentices and taking on disciples. Some "masters" sell books like "Divination Methods," "Physiognomy," "The Mystery of Palm Lines," "Six Lines and Eight Trigrams Diagram," and "Zhou Gong's Dream Interpretation" while practicing fortune-telling, and these books sell quite well.

During the fortune-telling process, the fortune-tellers always say things that people like to hear, satisfying the customers' spirits and psychology, making them happily pay. We have seen a few blind fortune-tellers, each with about 40 pieces of hard paper with braille inscriptions, each with titles such as "Auspicious Phoenix," "Qilin Brings Children," "Double Happiness Arrives," "Flowers Meet Sweet Dew," "Viewing Gold Across the River," and "Two People Fight for the Bridge." The latter two signs, which are not very auspicious, make up a very small portion, and the probability of drawing them is very low. Moreover, the fortune-tellers can make the drawers accept the signs during the explanation.

We believe that relevant departments should take measures and not allow this "fortune-telling craze" to continue to spread.

### 沈阳出现“算命”行业

　　沈阳出现“算命”行业
    最近，我市的主要繁华地段——南站、中街的北方大厦、辽宁工业展览馆及文化路立交桥附近等，算命先生日渐增多。他们三三两两聚在一起，选择交通便利，人流较多的地方，给人抽签、相面、看手相。这些人多是我市郊区以及邻近各县的农民或无业者，少数来自外省，既有青少年，也有中老年人，文盲、半文盲居多。
    据观察，这些算命先生已形成一种行业组织。组织内一般设有庄主、雇员、帮手，并明确规定了每个人的权利和义务，对营业地段的价格也有明确的规定和划分。未经这个行业组织允许，不能随便设摊营业。我们曾目睹一位来自黑龙江的算命先生刚摆摊，就被一个年轻人没收了他的做“活”工具。后经再三乞求，方允许其继续做“活”，但在天黑前必须交出１０元占地费。
    我们还发现，“算命行业”也出现招徒拜师现象。有的“先生”在算命的同时出售《推算法》、《相理学》、《麻纹相之谜》、《六爻八卦图》、《周公解梦》等书，而且销售量颇为可观。
    在算命的过程中，算命先生总讲一些人们爱听的话，使顾客精神上、心理上得到满足，愉快地掏钱。我们见到过几个盲人算命先生，他们每人备有４０多片刻有盲文的硬纸签，上有文字标题，如“彩凤呈祥”、“麒麟送子”、“双喜临门”、“花遇甘露”、“隔河望金”、“二人争桥”等等。后两种不大吉祥的签只占很少部分，被抽到的概率很小，而且算命先生在解释时也能使抽签者接受。
    我们认为，有关部门应采取措施，不应让这股“算命热”继续蔓延。
