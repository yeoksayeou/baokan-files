Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 9th.

On the afternoon of March 9, Premier Li Peng and Vice Premier Yao Yilin met with representatives attending the National Conference of Directors of Industry and Commerce.

Li Peng pointed out that the industry and commerce administration is an important department of the State Council. As reform and opening up deepen and the old system transitions to the new, the role of this department becomes increasingly important. During the period of rectification and rectification, it is even more necessary to further play the role of industry and commerce administration and achieve greater results.

He emphasized that the rectification and rectification of companies is an important part of rectification and rectification. After several months of rectification and rectification, this work has achieved results and should continue to be carried out vigorously.

Li Peng said that it is very important to strengthen the construction of the industry and commerce administration team. This team will continue to develop in the future, not only in quantity but also in quality. Education must be strengthened and anti-corruption work must be carried out. At the same time, the legitimate rights of industry and commerce administration personnel to enforce the law impartially should be protected, and they should not be subject to retaliation. The industry and commerce administration should receive the cooperation and support of public security and judicial organs.

Vice Premier Yao Yilin also spoke. He said that the annual inspection and enterprise legal person registration in industry and commerce administration work are very important links in the rectification and rectification of companies. Through the annual inspection, companies are actually reviewed once, which is a basic construction. If this year's annual inspection is done well, next year's annual inspection will be easier. Through the annual inspection, some companies can be revoked, some can be warned, and if they violate the law again, they will be revoked in the next year's annual inspection.

　　李鹏等会见各地工商局长时说
    继续抓紧清理整顿公司
    本报讯  ３月９日下午，国务院总理李鹏、副总理姚依林会见参加全国工商行政管理局长会议的代表。
    李鹏指出，工商行政管理机关，是国务院的一个重要部门，随着改革开放的深入，随着旧体制向新体制的过渡，这个部门的作用越来越重要。在治理整顿时期，更要进一步发挥工商行政管理的作用，做出更大的成绩。
    他强调，清理整顿公司是治理整顿的一个重要内容。经过几个月来的清理整顿，这项工作已经取得成效，要继续把清理整顿公司工作抓紧抓好。
    李鹏说，搞好工商行政管理的队伍建设很重要，这支队伍今后还要发展，不仅数量上要发展，更重要的是素质要提高，要加强教育，搞好廉政建设。同时，要保护工商行政管理人员秉公执法，不受打击报复，工商行政管理机关应该得到公安司法机关的配合和支持。
    姚依林同志也讲了话。他说，工商行政管理工作中的年检和企业法人登记，是清理整顿公司非常重要的环节，通过年检实际是把公司审查一遍，是一项基本建设，今年的年检搞好了，以后的年检就好办了。通过年检，有的公司可以撤销，有的可以警告，如果再违法，第二年年检时要撤销。
