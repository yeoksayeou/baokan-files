The good situation has hidden worries

Silk is the only product in which China has a monopoly in the international market. China's raw silk production accounts for 70% of the world's total, and its raw silk export volume accounts for 90% of the world's trade volume. The export volume of silk fabrics accounts for more than 40%, and both production and export rank first in the world.

In recent years, China's silk production has developed steadily. From 1984 to 1987, the annual cocoon production increased by about 5%. The development of cocoon, silk, and silk fabric production has brought about the prosperity of foreign trade. In 1987, exports earned $1.34 billion, an increase of 18.6% over 1986. In 1988, a new export record of $1.65 billion was set, an increase of 23.2% over the previous year. Among these, silk exports amounted to $550 million, an increase of 29%; silk fabric exports amounted to $550 million, an increase of 16%; and clothing and finished products exports amounted to $500 million, an increase of 24% over the previous year. The good situation of silk exports is encouraging.

However, behind the good situation, there are hidden worries. China's traditional cocoon, silk, and silk fabric industry is currently facing new challenges. The challenges come not only from the international market competition but also from the new contradictions that have emerged in the domestic market in the new situation. The "cocoon war" is a concentrated manifestation of this aspect. According to preliminary statistics from the Ministry of Textile Industry, in 1988, the national cocoon production increased by 6% compared to the previous year, but the quality of cocoons significantly declined, with more hairy cocoons and inferior cocoons. Consequently, the raw silk production in the same year decreased by 8%, and the silk fabric production decreased by 25%. This abnormal increase and decrease is one of the consequences of the "cocoon war."

Industry experts point out that we should not be overly optimistic about China's silk export situation in the past two years. In fact, a considerable part of the increase in export earnings in the past two years came from the rise in international market prices and the reduction of inventory and domestic sales. They say, "The cocoon war" is a bad thing, but it exposes many contradictions. As a "textbook" for our development of socialist commodity economy, it is worth studying in depth.

"Press down the gourd, and the bottle floats up"

On September 22, 1988, the State Council issued an emergency notice on the unified operation of cocoons and silk, which has been five months to date. Recently, reporters visited relevant departments and learned that the fires in various places have basically been extinguished, but the fundamental contradictions that triggered the war have not been resolved, and the production, supply, and sales relationships have not been straightened out. In some places, the contradictions are still quite sharp. Shanghai, where silk production and exports play a crucial role, is currently facing significant difficulties. In 1988, the state planned to import 1,000 tons of raw silk from Sichuan Province, but not a single ton has been delivered so far, and 1,000 silk weaving machines are facing the risk of being idle. In some cities in the Suzhou area, similar situations exist.

Why has the state's allocation plan not been realized? Experts say that after 10 years of reform and opening up, our economic work, including people's ideas, has undergone profound changes. In the reform, each region implemented foreign trade layer-by-layer contracting, plus the fiscal "separate stove eating," the profits and losses of cocoons and silk are all in the local area. Some regions and departments, in order to protect their own interests, no longer listen as they did during the "big pot eating" era. Therefore, to achieve a virtuous cycle of cocoon and silk production, we must not allow the farce of the "cocoon war" to be repeated, nor can we continue to use the old methods of blocking, restricting, and pressing, which do not respect economic laws. Otherwise, it will either be too rigid or "press down the gourd, and the bottle floats up."

Adjusting the industrial structure to alleviate supply and demand contradictions

How to solve the fundamental contradictions in cocoon, silk, and silk fabric production? Many experts believe that one of the main causes of the "cocoon war" is the blind development of reeling and weaving capabilities, which far exceed the level of cocoon production. According to investigations, the current national reeling and weaving equipment capacity is approximately one-third higher than the raw material supply capacity. Even if all cocoons are purchased, they cannot meet the needs of the processing industry, thus causing sharp contradictions between supply and demand. The cocoon war is essentially a supply and demand war. Therefore, experts advocate continuing to rectify the existing silk enterprises in various provinces and cities, resolutely shutting down and transforming enterprises with poor quality, high consumption, and low efficiency, and sending enough cocoons and silk to enterprises with high technological levels and strong product development and processing capabilities.

There is a significant gap in technological levels and benefits among silk enterprises in various regions of China. According to statistics from relevant departments, in 1986, the national average export finished products per weaving machine was 2,000 meters, while Shanghai was 10,000 meters; the silk export qualification rate was 88.2% on average, while Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai were 90% to 94%; the average per capita realized profit and tax was 1,700 yuan nationwide, while Jiangsu and Zhejiang were above 1,900 yuan, and Shanghai was as high as 4,772 yuan. At the same time, because Shanghai and some large enterprises in Jiangsu and Zhejiang produce many famous products that enjoy a high reputation in the international market, the export selling price is 10% to 20% higher than that of general products. This means that the same amount of raw materials will create much more wealth in these enterprises. This is a big account.

Another factor that cannot be ignored in causing the "cocoon war" is that some people take advantage of multiple exchange rates and special policies to engage in arbitrage, raising the prices of raw silk and greige fabric. The foreign exchange from exporting raw silk in special economic zones is basically all retained, while in inland areas, only 25% is retained, a difference of four times. This allows some companies to purchase raw silk at prices 50% to 80% higher than the state-regulated prices, while inland enterprises cannot afford it.

The iron law of value is unyielding

"The cocoon war" is related to the price problem in the cocoon, silk, and silk fabric industry. For a long time, the cocoon price has been too low, and the distribution of interests among agriculture, industry, and commerce is disproportionate, which is the biggest obstacle to the smooth relationship between various links in the cocoon, silk, and silk fabric industry. This is the view of many experts. According to a recent investigation and analysis by Shanghai, the export earnings per 100 meters of real silk fabric are twice as high as those in agriculture or industry. The low cocoon price is a long-standing problem. Farmers in Zhejiang have a traditional calculation: "One mu of mulberry field is equivalent to three mu of grain, and one jin of fresh cocoons is equivalent to three jin of meat." Now they say: "A handful of cocoons is not worth a single honey peach." Since 1987, cocoons have been in short supply, and there has been a rush to purchase them, breaking through the historical low price line. However, it has also reached the other extreme, with some places experiencing unreasonably high prices, causing harm to the state and enterprises, and in the long run, it is not beneficial to farmers. Experts believe that these wars have shown the iron law of value, and in the future, we should strive to make prices more accurately reflect value and supply and demand relationships, and consider the interests of the state, enterprises, farmers, and other parties.

In connection with this, people believe that to correctly draw lessons from this "war," in the future, we must not only strengthen planned management but also, in an organized and leadership-driven manner, establish a cocoon and silk fabric market, combining macro-control with market mechanisms, achieving both control and flexibility, control without rigidity, and flexibility without chaos, gradually moving towards a new economic operation mechanism where the state controls the market and the market guides enterprises.

Supporting farmers to develop cocoon production

According to reports from various places, after the "cocoon war," farmers' enthusiasm for silkworm breeding has not been dampened, and some places are actively expanding production. The correct way to prevent the "cocoon war" from recurring is to develop cocoon production.

For a long time, the relevant departments' approach to silkworm farmers has been more about cutting (controlling prices, refusing to purchase) and less about promoting. In the past two years, they were always afraid that farmers would produce too many silkworms, and as late as July 1986, they were still warning that "the situation of national silk production exceeding consumption is further deteriorating," advocating cutting. The facts are the opposite of their estimates. The country quickly entered a tense situation of "reeling silk lacking cocoons and weaving silk lacking silk," and in 1987, the first "war" finally broke out.

To develop sericulture, experts suggest that in the future, we should not only continue to support old sericulture areas but also combine it with poverty alleviation to establish new sericulture bases in the central and western regions of China. In the past two years, Suzhou City, through negotiations with impoverished areas, has reached agreements with Shaanxi, Anhui, Sichuan, and other places to jointly develop sericulture bases for poverty alleviation. This approach not only helps impoverished areas develop their economy but also opens up a source of raw materials for enterprises, which is worth supporting and encouraging.

The various contradictions faced by cocoon, silk, and silk fabric production ultimately reflect China's lack of a set of practical industrial policies in this regard, which is the root cause of the chaos. To revitalize the sericulture and silk industry and consolidate and expand China's strong position in the world economic arena, it is necessary to reform the existing system, formulate a sound sericulture and silk industry policy, straighten out the relationships between various parties, and prevent the "cocoon war" from reigniting.

### 茧丝绸的反思

　　茧丝绸的反思
    本报记者  李茜
    好形势后面有隐忧
    丝绸是我国在国际市场上唯一占垄断地位的商品。我国生丝产量占世界产量的７０％，生丝出口量占世界市场贸易量的９０％，绸缎出口量占４０％以上，生产和出口都居世界首位。
    近几年我国丝绸生产稳步发展，１９８４年至１９８７年，蚕茧产量平均每年增长５％左右。茧、丝、绸生产的发展带来了外贸的日益兴旺，１９８７年出口创汇１３．４亿美元，比１９８６年增长１８．６％，１９８８年创出口１６．５亿美元的新纪录，比上年增长２３．２％。其中丝类出口５．５亿美元，增长２９％；绸缎出口５．５亿美元，增长１６％，服装及制成品出口５亿美元，比上年增长２４％。丝绸出口的好形势令人鼓舞。
    但是，好形势背后也存在着隐忧。我国茧、丝、绸这个传统产业，目前正面临着新的挑战。挑战不仅来自国际市场的角逐，更来自国内市场上新形势下出现的新的矛盾，“蚕茧大战”就是这方面的集中表现。据纺织工业部初步统计，１９８８年全国蚕茧产量比上年增长６％，但蚕茧质量显著下降，毛脚茧和劣质茧增加，因而同年的生丝产量比上年减少８％，绸产量比上年下降２５％。这不正常的一增一减，就是“蚕茧大战”带来的恶果之一。
    纺织界有识之士指出，对我国这两年丝绸出口的好形势不能过分乐观，实际上这两年出口创汇的增长，有相当部分来自国际市场价格的上升，以及压缩库存和内销而取得的。他们说，“蚕茧之战”是坏事，但它暴露了多种矛盾，作为我们发展社会主义商品经济的“教材”，很值得深入地研究一番。
    “按下葫芦浮起瓢”
    去年９月２２日，国务院发出了茧丝实行统一经营的紧急通知，迄今已５个月。最近记者访问了有关部门，得悉各地的战火已经基本熄灭，但引发大战的基本矛盾仍未解决，产供销关系尚未理顺，在有些地方矛盾仍然相当尖锐。丝绸生产和出口在我国占有举足轻重地位的上海，目前就面临着很大困难。１９８８年国家计划由四川省调进生丝１０００吨，迄今一吨未兑现，１０００台织绸机面临缺粮断炊的危险。在苏南一些城市，也存在同样情况。
    为什么国家的调拨计划未能实现？专家们说，１０年改革开放，我们的经济工作，包括人们的观念，已经发生深刻变革，各地在改革中实行了外贸层层包干，加上财政“分灶吃饭”，茧丝盈亏都在地方，一些地区和部门为了维护本身的利益，不再像“吃大锅饭”时那样听话了。因此，要实现蚕茧与丝绸生产的良性循环，既不能允许“蚕茧大战”那样的闹剧重演，也不能再沿用过去那种一味堵、卡、压，不尊重经济规律的老办法行事，不然不是统得过死，就是“按下葫芦浮起瓢”。
    调整产业结构缓解供需矛盾
    如何解决茧、丝、绸生产中的根本矛盾呢？不少专家认为，造成“蚕茧大战”的基本原因之一，是缫丝、织绸能力盲目发展，大大超过了蚕茧生产水平。据调查，现在全国缫丝与织绸设备能力，约高于原料供应能力的１／３，即使把蚕茧全部收购到手，也不能满足加工业的需要，这就造成了供需之间的尖锐矛盾，蚕茧之战，实际上就是供需之战。因此，专家们主张，必须继续对各省市现有丝绸企业进行整顿，坚决将质量差、消耗大、效益低的企业关停并转，把足够数量的茧丝送到技术水平高，产品开发和加工能力强的企业。
    我国各地丝绸企业之间的技术水平和效益差距相当大。据有关部门统计，１９８６年全国平均每台织绸机提供的出口成品为２０００米，上海则为１万米；丝绸出口合格率平均８８．２％，江苏、浙江、上海为９０％至９４％，人均实现利税全国平均１７００元，江、浙两省在１９００元以上，上海则高达４７７２元。同时，由于上海和江浙一些大企业多生产在国际上享有盛誉的名牌产品，出口销价比一般产品高出１０％至２０％。这就是说，同样数量的原料，在这些企业里将创造出多得多的财富。这是一笔大帐。
    导致“蚕茧大战”还有一个不可忽视的因素，就是有人钻多种汇率和特殊政策的空子，从中倒买倒卖，抬高生丝和坯绸的价格。特区出口生丝外汇基本全部留成，内地则只留２５％，相差４倍。这就使有的公司可以用比国家规定的价格高出５０％至８０％的价格收购生丝，而内地企业则难以承受。
    价值规律铁面无私
    “蚕茧大战”与茧丝绸行业存在的价格问题有关。长期以来茧价偏低，农工贸之间利益分配悬殊，是导致茧丝绸行业各个环节关系不能够理顺的最大障碍，这是不少专家的看法。据上海不久前的调查分析，百米真丝绸的出口收益外贸净收入比农业或工业均高２倍。茧价偏低是长期存在的问题，浙江蚕农有个传统算法：“１亩桑田３亩粮，１斤鲜茧３斤肉。”如今他们说：“一把茧还抵不上一只水蜜桃。”１９８７年以来蚕茧短缺，竞相抢购，冲破了历史上的低价线，但又摆到了另一头，一些地方出现了不合理的过高价格，使国家与企业受害，从长远看对农民也不利。专家们认为，这几次大战是价值规律显示了它铁面无私的威力，今后应该力求使价格更能够确切地反映价值和供求关系，兼顾国家、企业、农民等各方面的利益。
    与此相联系，人们认为，要正确吸取这次“大战”的教训，今后既要加强计划管理，还得有组织有领导的建立蚕茧、丝绸市场，把宏观控制与市场机制结合起来，做到该统的统，该活的活，统而不死，活而不乱，逐步走上国家调控市场，市场引导企业新的经济运行机制。
    扶持农民发展蚕茧生产
    据各地反映，“蚕茧大战”之后，农民养蚕的热情并未受挫，有些地方在积极扩大生产。防止“蚕茧大战”再起的正确办法，只能是发展蚕茧生产。
    长期以来，有关部门对蚕农的习惯做法是多了砍（刹价、拒收），少了赶。前两年，他们老是害怕农民养蚕多了，直到１９８６年７月还在惊呼“全国蚕丝产大于销的状况有进一步加剧趋势”，主张砍。事实与他们估计的相反，全国很快出现了“缫丝缺茧，织绸缺丝”的紧张局面，１９８７年终于爆发了第一次“大战”。
    要发展桑蚕生产，有专家建议，今后既要继续扶持老桑蚕产区，还可以同扶贫结合起来，在我国中部和西部贫困地区建立新的蚕桑基地。苏州市前两年经与贫困地区协商，已达成了在陕北、安徽、四川等地联合开发蚕桑基地的扶贫协议，这种做法，既帮助贫困地区发展了经济，也开辟了企业的原料来源，这是应当支持与鼓励的。
    茧、丝、绸生产面临的种种矛盾，归根到底，反映了我国在这方面缺乏一套切合实际的产业政策，这是导致混乱的总根子。为了振兴蚕丝绸行业巩固并扩大中国丝绸在世界经济舞台上的强大地位，必须改革现行体制，制定健全的蚕丝绸产业政策，理顺各方面的关系，防止“蚕茧大战”死灰复燃。
