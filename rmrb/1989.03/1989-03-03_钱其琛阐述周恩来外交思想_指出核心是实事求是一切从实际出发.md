Qian Qichen, the Foreign Minister, at the "Zhou Enlai's Diplomatic Thought and Practice Seminar" held today, expounded on Zhou Enlai's diplomatic thought from eight aspects:

	1. The main task of diplomatic work is to handle relations between countries, with the primary focus being various governments and their leaders;
	2. Extending the fundamental experience of the Chinese revolution to the field of diplomacy, proposing that the independence and autonomy of the Chinese nation is the basic stance of New China's diplomacy;
	3. Proposing that war and peace are the main contradictions of the contemporary world, maintaining world peace is the primary goal of New China's diplomacy, and the policy of peace is the basic policy of our diplomacy;
	4. Creatively proposing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as guidelines for establishing new types of state relations and a new international order;
	5. Proposing the correct combination of internationalism and patriotism as a guiding ideology for handling the interests of one's own country with those of other countries in diplomatic work;
	6. Emphasizing international economic relations, advocating for active and equal mutual benefit international cooperation based on self-reliance, to benefit our country's socialist construction and human economic prosperity;
	7. In international relations, advocating "seeking common ground while reserving differences" as a guiding principle and basic method for handling various contradictions;
	8. Drawing nourishment from traditional philosophy, proposing a set of diplomatic strategies and diplomatic arts with distinctive characteristics of the Chinese nation.

Qian Qichen pointed out that the core running through all aspects of Zhou Enlai's diplomatic thought and practice is seeking truth from facts and starting from reality. This can be said to be a character trait, a style, and ultimately a thought line. It is with this spirit that he both has a far-reaching vision and keeps his feet on the ground, always proposing the goals and tasks of diplomatic work based on the needs and possibilities of the international situation and our country's reality. He both adheres to Marxism and dares to propose new ideas and new concepts according to the changes in the situation.

In the seminar, Qian Qichen also discussed Zhou Enlai's diplomatic style: having a clear stance, persuading with reason; being open and unconstrained, neither humble nor arrogant; seeking truth from facts, keeping one's word; making friends sincerely, with loyalty and trust; being humble and cautious, and open-minded and eager to learn.

    本报北京3月2日讯　记者成元生、温宪报道，钱其琛外长在今天的“周恩来外交思想与实践研讨会”上，从八个方面阐述了周恩来的外交思想：
    一、外交工作的主要任务是处理国家之间的关系，主要对象是各国政府及其当权者；
    二、把中国革命的根本经验引伸到外交领域，提出中华民族的独立自主是新中国外交的基本立场；
    三、提出战争与和平是当今世界的主要矛盾，维护世界和平是新中国外交的首要目标，和平政策是我国外交的基本政策；
    四、创造性地提出了和平共处五项原则，作为建立新型国家关系和国际新秩序的准则；
    五、提出国际主义与爱国主义正确结合的论点，作为外交工作中处理本国利益同其他国家利益的指导思想；
    六、重视国际经济关系，主张在自力更生基础上积极开展平等互利的国际合作，以利我国的社会主义建设和人类经济繁荣；
    七、在国际关系中提倡“求同存异”，作为处理各种矛盾的指导方针和基本方法；
    八、从传统哲学中汲取营养，提出一整套富有中华民族特色的外交策略和外交艺术。
    钱其琛指出，贯穿周恩来外交思想与实践各个方面的核心是实事求是、一切从实际出发。这可以说是一种品格，一种作风，归根到底这是一条思想路线。正是本着这种精神，他既高瞻远瞩，又脚踏实地，总是从国际形势和我国实际的需要和可能提出外交工作的目标和任务。他既坚持马克思主义，又勇于根据形势的变化提出新的思想、新的观念。
    在研讨会中，钱其琛还谈到了周恩来的外交风格：态度鲜明，以理服人；落落大方，不卑不亢；实事求是，说话算数；交友以诚，肝胆相照；谦虚谨慎，虚心好学。
