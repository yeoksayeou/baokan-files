Since the 1980s, alongside global economic structural adjustments, international capital flows have undergone significant changes: the investment positions of major developed countries have shifted relatively; the entities engaging in cross-border investments have become more diversified; international direct investments have shown clear regional biases; and competition in this area among them has intensified.

Since the 1980s, international capital flows have undergone a series of structural changes. These changes have already or are in the process of driving countries around the world to adjust their foreign trade, outward investment, and financing strategies.

Financial capital is increasingly internationalized: the volume of international capital flows has reached $75 trillion, far exceeding the volume of global goods and services trade, with the former being approximately 23 times the latter. The currencies of new economic powers (such as Japan) are moving towards internationalization, new international financial centers (such as Hong Kong) are emerging, and new technologies and methods for international financing are continuously innovating. Transnational banks, alongside transnational corporations, are extending their reach to every corner of the world. Various forms of financial speculation aimed at profit and foreign exchange hedging aimed at preserving value are becoming increasingly prevalent.

The geographical and sectoral distribution of international direct investments has shown clear biases: the two-way flow of capital among developed countries is increasing daily, accounting for approximately 3/4 of international direct investments. Among these, the United States is a particularly hot investment destination. In 1986, the United States attracted $209.3 billion in foreign direct investment, accounting for approximately 39% of international direct investments. Meanwhile, direct investments in developing countries have continued to decline. The inflow of direct investments into developing countries peaked at $15 billion in 1981, but since 1983, it has hovered around $10 billion to $11.5 billion. However, a few newly industrialized countries and resource-rich countries are exceptions. Between 1980 and 1985, 18 countries or regions (such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Egypt, Nigeria, Tunisia, etc.) attracted 86% of the direct investments into all developing countries. Remarkably, under the shadow of the debt crisis, the flow of funds from developing countries to developed countries has turned "net positive," with net transfers of funds reaching $2 billion annually in the mid-1980s. Additionally, the sectoral structure of international capital flows has also shown biases. Under the conditions of the new technological revolution, high-tech industries, finance, banking, insurance, and other intangible industries are favored by international capital, while developing countries' traditional industries, which have advantages in human and natural resources, are relatively "neglected."

The international investment positions of various countries have also undergone relative changes: by the mid-1980s, the United States had become the world's largest debtor nation, while Japan had surged to become the world's largest creditor nation. By the end of September 1987, Japan's total international assets reached $1.4 trillion, international loans reached $509 billion, and net overseas assets were $250 billion. In 1986, Japan's direct investments abroad doubled compared to 1985, with a total of $34.5 billion in investments over these two years, almost equivalent to the total investments from 1951 to 1980 over 30 years.

It is worth noting that contemporary international trade and capital flows are increasingly breaking through the traditional international division of labor based on natural specialization, leading to a higher form of international division of labor characterized by intra-regional, intra-industry, and intra-firm (i.e., within transnational corporations) trade and investment. As the process of regional economic integration accelerates, this intra-industry, intra-firm transnational investment will become a powerful weapon to penetrate and overcome regional collective trade protectionism and will have special strategic significance in international competition.

Transnational corporations are the main carriers of contemporary capital (especially productive capital) in the international arena. According to estimates by the United Nations Transnational Corporations Center, there are approximately 100,000 subsidiaries of transnational corporations from developed countries, with their cumulative direct investments worldwide reaching $713.5 billion by 1985. There are more than 600 giant transnational corporations with sales exceeding $10 billion, known as the "$10 billion club." The global investment and production activities of transnational corporations have made the decisive link in the circulation of capital—the production process—transcend the narrow boundaries of nation-states. This marks a profound shift in the internationalization of capital from primarily exporting commodities and lending capital to primarily exporting productive capital.

In the field of direct investments, international competition is intensifying. Investing in high-tech frontiers for research and development-type direct investments and directly acquiring the latest technologies has become a special competitive means under the conditions of the new technological revolution.

From the perspective of utilizing direct investments, third-world capital-importing countries, taking the opportunity to provide coastal export processing zones, are competing to attract the inflow of international capital, indicating that developing countries are more deeply and broadly involved in the internal division of labor system of transnational corporations than ever before.

Since the latter half of the 1970s, some developing countries and regions have broken away from the traditional vertical and unidirectional flow patterns of international capital, engaging in mutual investments among themselves and even showing "upstream investments" to Northern countries. The emerging transnational corporations from developing countries in the South have different operating mechanisms from traditional transnational corporations. Their rapid rise signifies the diversification of contemporary international investments.

　　当代国际资本流动的新格局
    夏申
    内容提要：
    进入８０年代以来，伴随着全球性经济结构的调整，国际资本流动也出现了格局性变化：世界主要发达国家的投资地位发生了相对变化；国际间对外投资的主体趋于多元化；国际直接投资的区域发生明显的倾斜；与此同时他们之间在这个领域中的竞争也愈演愈烈。
    进入８０年代以来，国际资本流动发生了一系列格局性变化。已经或正在促使世界各国利用外贸、对外投资和融资战略发生新的变化。
    金融资本日趋国际化：国际资本流动额现已高达７５万亿美元，大大超过世界商品和劳务交易额，前者约为后者的２３倍。新的经济大国（如日本）货币走向国际化，新的国际金融中心（如香港）崛起，国际融资的新技术和新手段不断创新，跨国银行伴随跨国公司将触角伸向世界各地，各种以赢利为目的的金融投机行为和以保值为目的的套期外汇业务日益加强。
    国际直接投资的区位和部门分布发生明显的倾斜：发达国家的资本双向对流与日俱增，约占国际直接投资的３／４，其中美国尤为投资热点，１９８６年美国吸收外国直接投资已达２０９３亿美元，约占国际直接投资的３９％。与此同时，对发展中国家的直接投资却一再递减，流入发展中国家的直接投资１９８１年最高曾达到１５０亿美元，１９８３年以后，便一直徘徊在１００亿—１１５亿美元左右。但少数新兴工业化国家和自然资源丰富的国家是个例外，１９８０—１９８５年间１８个国家或地区（如阿根廷、巴西、智利、哥伦比亚、墨西哥、香港、印尼、马来西亚、新加坡、我国的台湾、泰国、埃及、尼日利亚、突尼斯等）吸收直接投资占全体发展中国家的８６％。令人咋舌的是，在债务危机的阴影笼罩下，发展中国家向发达国家的资金流动出现“净转移”，８０年代中期这种净转移资金每年已达２０亿美元。此外，国际资本流动的部门结构也发生了倾斜现象，在新技术革命条件下，高技术产业、金融、银行、保险等无形产业颇受国际资本青睐，而发展中国家拥有人力与自然资源优势的传统产业却相对“失宠”。
    世界各国的对外投资地位也发生了相对变动：８０年代中期美国沦为世界上最大的债务国，而日本却一跃成为世界头号债权国。到１９８７年９月底，日本持有国际资产总额达１．４万亿美元，国际贷款达５０９０亿美元，海外资产净额为２５００亿美元。１９８６年，日本对外直接投资比１９８５年陡增一倍，这两年的对外投资共达３４５亿美元，几乎相当于１９５１—１９８０年３０年的总和。
    值得注意的是，当代国际贸易和资本流动日益突破以自然分工为基础的传统国际分工模式，出现了以区域内、产业内、公司内（即跨国公司内部）相互贸易与投资为特征的更高形态的国际分工格局。由于国际经济区域性一体化进程正在加速，这种产业内、公司内的跨国投资将成为渗透、越过区域性集体贸易保护主义的有力武器，并在国际竞争中具有特殊的战略意义。
    跨国公司是当代资本（尤其是生产资本）在国际范围内运动的主要承担者。据联合国跨国公司中心估计，目前发达国家跨国公司约有１０万家子公司，它们在世界范围内直接投资累计额到１９８５年已达７１３５亿美元。现销售额超过１０亿美元的巨型跨国公司逾６００家，号称“１０亿美元俱乐部”。跨国公司遍及全球的投资与生产活动，使资本循环的决定性环节——生产过程越出了民族国家的狭隘界限，它标志着资本运动的国际化从商品输出、借贷资本输出为主向生产资本输出为主的深刻转变。
    在直接投资领域中，国际竞争愈演愈烈。到高科技前沿地带进行研究开发型直接投资，直接猎取最新技术，已成为新技术革命条件下国际资本角逐的特殊竞争手段。
    从利用直接投资来看，第三世界资本输入国以提供沿海出口加工区为契机，竞相展开吸引国际资本流入的“热战”，这说明发展中国家比以往任何时候更深更广地卷入了跨国公司的内部分工体系之中。
    ７０年代下半期以来，一些发展中国家和地区打破了传统国际资本垂直性、单向性的流动形态，开展了南南之间的相互投资、甚至还出现了向北方国家的“上游投资”现象。南方发展中国家的新兴跨国公司具有不同于传统跨国公司的特殊的运行机制，它的异军突起标志着当代国际投资趋于多元化。
