Title: Prime Minister Abandons Resignation Threat, Accepts Reform Measures

Sudan has temporarily weathered a political crisis.

Sudanese Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi announced on March 5 that he would dissolve the current government and immediately begin organizing a "broad-based government" that includes all political forces and union representatives. A two-week-long political crisis in Sudan appears to be easing.

Mahdi abruptly changed his stance from threatening to resign as prime minister on February 27, expressing his willingness to accept reform measures and work towards resolving the southern conflict. He has gained preliminary understanding from the military and various political parties, thus avoiding further escalation of tensions. Although predictions vary, this compromise has prevented Sudan, which is on the brink of a deep political and economic crisis, from completely losing control.

Sudan's political crisis began on February 21 when 300 officers submitted a memorandum to the government with a deadline. The military demanded political reforms and the establishment of a new "national salvation government." Long-standing conflicts between Mahdi's cabinet and the chairman of the Supreme Council, Mirghani, as well as 38 political parties, came to the surface. For a time, various sectors of society went on strike and closed shops, the military was on high alert, and political and military forces faced off, seemingly ready for a showdown. On the evening of February 26, there was an unexpected incident where Mirghani's residence was attacked. Some domestic opinions speculated that a civil war was imminent.

According to local observers, while power distribution and ideological differences contributed to Sudan's political turmoil, the main issue is the southern conflict. In November of last year, the then-participating Sudanese Democratic Unionist Party (SDUP) and the southern anti-government "Sudan People's Liberation Army" (SPLA) signed a peace agreement. The agreement involved freezing the September 1983 decree, not declaring "Sudan as an Islamic state," and preparing for a national constitutional conference on December 31, 1988, to achieve national reconciliation and end the long-standing southern conflict. However, the ruling Umma Party and the National Islamic Front not only did not recognize the legitimacy of this agreement but also revoked the SDUP's negotiating authority, causing the party to withdraw from the cabinet.

Whether Sudan's south should be at war or at peace has become the focal point of the conflict between the political and military sectors.

The National Islamic Front, due to racial (the south is predominantly black) and religious (the south is a Christian region) reasons, advocates for war; the Umma Party led by Mahdi, the Democratic Unionist Party led by Mirghani, the military, and various sectors of society advocate for peace.

In reality, Sudan can no longer bear the burden of another war. In recent years, Sudan has faced numerous disasters, including floods in the Nile, locust plagues, prolonged droughts, encephalitis, diseases, and cholera outbreaks. In 1988 alone, it is estimated that 260,000 to 500,000 refugees died from natural and man-made disasters. Sudan has become one of the poorest countries in the world, yet its war expenditure is as high as $235 million, or $12 per person. The southern war consumes $1 million per day.

Since the overthrow of former President Nimeiri in 1985, Sudan has had five defense ministers, but none have been able to win the internal war. The southern anti-government forces recently captured five cities and bombarded the capital of Equatoria Province with heavy artillery, showing a trend of advancing.

In addition, neighboring countries also have varying degrees of influence on Sudan's situation.

The memorandum submitted by Sudanese officers to Prime Minister Mahdi, in a sense, is an ultimatum from the military to stop the southern war. Within a week, various political forces in the country engaged in repeated negotiations and finally reached a compromise on March 4. Sixty political and military leaders signed a seven-point agreement to maintain the democratic system in the presidential palace.

Prime Minister Mahdi signed the agreement. Although the National Islamic Front did not sign, it did not close the door to cooperation with the new government. The agreement includes maintaining the democratic system, achieving southern reconciliation, convening a constitutional conference, alleviating the economic crisis, implementing balanced diplomacy, and preparing for national elections. It, along with Prime Minister Mahdi's commitments the next day at a press conference, forms the basis for Sudan to temporarily weather the crisis. Although there are still some unclear internal and external factors in the formation of the new government, people from all walks of life in Sudan are eagerly looking forward to quickly overcoming the current difficulties.

### 总理放弃辞职威胁接受改革措施  苏丹暂时渡过政局危机

　　总理放弃辞职威胁接受改革措施
    苏丹暂时渡过政局危机
    本报记者  林皎明
    苏丹总理迈赫迪３月５日宣布解散现政府，由他立即着手组织“具有广泛基础的、包括所有政治势力和工会代表参加的新政府”。一场持续两周时间的苏丹政局危机初见缓解势头。
    迈赫迪突然改变他２月２７日威胁辞去总理职务的作法，表示愿意接受改革措施、尽力实现南部争端和解，取得军方及各政党团体的初步谅解，避免了矛盾进一步激化。虽然目前各种预测不一，但这一折衷办法使处于深刻政治、经济危机总爆发边缘的苏丹局势不致完全失控。
    苏丹这次政局危机始于２月２１日３００名军官向政府递交的一份限期“备忘录”。军界要求内阁进行政治改革，成立新的“救国政府”。长期潜藏在迈赫迪内阁与最高委员会主席米尔加尼及３８个政党团体之间的矛盾公开化。一时间，社会各界罢工罢市，军队处于最高戒备状态，政军两界力量对峙，煞有摊牌架势。２月２６日晚又发生米尔加尼住宅遭袭击的突发事件。苏丹国内某些舆论估计一场内战在即。
    据此间观察家分析，苏丹政局动荡固然有权力分配、政见分歧等因素，但主要矛盾在于南部争端问题。去年１１月，当时参与内阁的苏丹第二大政党联合民主党与南部反政府的“苏丹人民解放军”签署和平协议，其中涉及到冻结１９８３年９月法令，不再宣布“苏丹是伊斯兰国家”，并筹备在１９８８年１２月３１日召开实现民族和解的全国宪政大会，结束长期以来存在的南部争端。但执政的乌玛党和全国伊斯兰阵线不仅不承认这一协议的合法性，而且撤销统一民主党的谈判委任权，致使该党退出内阁。
    苏丹南部是战还是和，成为政军两界矛盾的焦点。
    全国伊斯兰阵线由于种族（南部主要居住黑人）、宗教（南部为基督教区）等原因，主战；以迈赫迪为首的乌玛党、以米尔加尼为首的联合民主党、军界及社会各界，主和。
    实际情况是，苏丹国情再也承担不起内战的重压。近年来，苏丹国内祸不单行，尼罗河水泛滥，蝗灾袭击，干旱连年，脑炎、疾病、霍乱猖獗。仅１９８８年估算就有２６万至５０万难民死于天灾人祸。苏丹已经沦为世界最贫穷国家之一，但其内战军费却高达２．３５亿美元，人均１２美元。南部战争每天消耗１百万美元。
    从１９８５年推翻尼迈里前总统以来，苏丹已经换了５任国防部长，但谁都无法打赢这场内战。南部反政府军近来１周内攻下５座城市，重炮轰击南部赤道省首府，一派进逼态势。
    除此之外，邻国对苏丹形势也存在不同程度的影响。
    苏丹军官向迈赫迪总理递交的限期“备忘录”，在某种意义上说是军界要求停止南部战争的通牒。一周内，国内各派政治势力反复较量，终于在３月４日达成妥协。６０名政军各界要员在共和国宫签署了维护民主政体的７点协议。
    迈赫迪总理在协议上签了字。全国伊斯兰阵线虽未签字，但也不关死与新政府合作的大门。协议内容包括维护民主政体、实现南部和解、召开宪政大会、缓解经济危机、执行平衡外交、筹备全国大选等内容。它与迈赫迪总理次日在记者招待会上的允诺，构成了苏丹政局暂渡危机的基础。尽管新政府的组建还有一些不十分明朗的内外因素，但苏丹各界人士迫切盼望尽快渡过当前难关。
