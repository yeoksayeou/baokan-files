Inflation fears linger, and there are concerns about an economic slowdown. Liu Guoguang proposes that the key to solving these issues lies in a "two-pronged approach": tightening overall demand and adjusting the economic structure.

	● A seemingly plausible but misleading theory: Addressing the economic environment should focus on increasing total supply rather than reducing total demand.
	● An incorrect mindset: Everyone wants to avoid significant pain, hoping to comfortably navigate the economic downturn amidst a scene of prosperity.

In a series of theoretical discussions and during family gatherings for the Lunar New Year, people gathered to discuss, with the economy being the primary concern. On one hand, the aftereffects of inflation persist; on the other hand, there are fears of an economic slowdown. How can we find a way out of this economic dilemma? With these questions in mind, the reporter interviewed renowned economist Liu Guoguang.

The old expert's desk was piled high with files and books on both sides, obviously the result of much thought. He pointed out, "Currently, in the process of rectifying the economic environment, we indeed face a 'two-pronged dilemma'—persisting with tightening measures will exacerbate the shortage of funds and difficulties in fund turnover; abandoning tightening measures will lead to a new round of inflation, which will be difficult to control. What should we do? It seems we must adopt a 'two-pronged approach,' one hand tightening the overall demand, the other adjusting the economic structure."

At this point, he flipped through a stack of materials and continued, "Today's 'two-pronged dilemma' is not the first time we've encountered it. In 1985, in response to the overheating economy at the time, a policy of tightening overall demand was adopted. However, by early 1986, there were complaints everywhere, and even in academic circles, some people opposed tightening, arguing that it caused 'massive losses in national income.' The result was a complete relaxation of monetary policy, and the overheating economy, which had not yet 'soft-landed,' rose again. The tightening measures in the fourth quarter of 1987 were also not sustained, leading to worsening inflation. Last March, at a meeting, Liu Guoguang solemnly delivered a speech titled 'Facing Up to Inflation.' Now, he believes that the alarm bells need to keep ringing, and the problems need to be faced squarely."

"Why is it that as soon as we tighten, there are complaints, and as soon as there are complaints, we loosen, and as soon as we loosen, inflation surges?"

Liu Guoguang said, "This is related to a seemingly plausible but misleading theory. This theory suggests that addressing the economic environment should focus on increasing total supply rather than reducing total demand. However, analyzing the national economy over the past few years, the main cause of the imbalance in total quantity is excessive total demand, not insufficient total supply. Total supply is reflected in statistical production speeds. From the annual increase of over 10% in industrial output over the past few years, it can be seen that the growth of total supply is not low. The 'bottlenecks' we are currently facing in energy, raw materials, foreign exchange, and funds reflect that, relative to China's current resource capacity, the absolute quantity of industrial production supply is not too little but too much. The problem lies in the irrational supply structure. Therefore, vaguely advocating for increasing total supply is like adding fuel to an already overheated economy, which is obviously an inappropriate 'prescription.' The correct approach should be to control the total demand from the root, while adjusting the supply structure to increase truly effective supply."

When talking about increasing effective supply, Liu Guoguang said that the tightening period should be a great opportunity for structural adjustment. We should fully utilize this opportunity, flexibly allocate funds, and flexibly use credit and fiscal policies to support enterprises that truly provide effective supply to increase production, thereby optimizing the industrial structure, product structure, and enterprise structure. As for those factories with redundant construction, redundant introductions, low efficiency, and resource waste, they should be firmly squeezed out and eliminated like squeezing a pimple. Otherwise, if we do not seize the opportunity to make significant adjustments to the irrational and low-efficiency economic structure, the economic body's deep-seated problems will worsen and intensify in the context of sustained inflation, potentially evolving into long-term stagflation. This is something we must strive to avoid.

Achieving the goal of rectifying the economic environment will require significant sacrifices. Liu Guoguang believes that there is a worrying incorrect mindset at present, which is that everyone wants to avoid significant pain, hoping to comfortably navigate the economic downturn amidst a scene of prosperity. Such a mental state will not be able to withstand the test of tightening. For example, everyone knows that social group consumption needs to be reduced, but no one wants to reduce it for themselves. At the beginning of last year, the plan was to reduce it by 20%, but the actual execution result was an increase of more than 20% compared to the previous year. If all tightening measures are executed in this manner, they will be tight in name but loose in reality, aiming to reduce but actually increasing, with minimal effect. Therefore, from now on, everyone from top to bottom must be prepared to endure temporary pain. Enterprises that cannot operate well must be closed, merged, or transformed; products without competitiveness must be eliminated. The process of tightening will inevitably become one of supporting the strong and limiting the weak, selecting the best and eliminating the worst. Of course, during the tightening period, reforms in the social security system, public welfare system, and fair distribution policies (including tax reform) must be accelerated to establish necessary institutions to mitigate the difficulties brought by closures and unemployment to some people, and to stimulate the enthusiasm of all personnel.

　　通货膨胀余悸未消，又担心出现经济滑坡。刘国光提出，解决问题的关键是“两手抓”：
    紧缩总量　调整结构
    ●一种似是而非的理论：治理经济环境不能着眼于压缩总需求，而应着力于
    增加总供给
    ●一种不正确的心态：都想不伤筋动骨，在歌舞升平的景象中舒舒服服趟过
    经济低谷
    在接二连三的理论讨论会上，在喜迎新春的家家餐桌上，人们聚首议论，最关心的仍然是经济问题。一方面，通货膨胀余悸未消；一方面，又担心着出现经济滑坡。怎样找到国民经济柳暗花明的出路？带着这样的疑问，记者采访了著名经济学家刘国光。
    老专家的书桌两侧齐刷刷的堆放着卷宗和书籍，显然已几经思考。他指出：“目前，在治理经济环境的过程中，我们确实遇到了‘两难’问题——坚持紧缩，会加剧资金的紧缺和资金周转的困难；放弃紧缩，新一轮的通货膨胀就会如脱缰野马，难以收拾。怎么办？看来必须抓‘两手’，一手抓总量的紧缩，一手抓结构的调整。”
    谈到这里，他顺手翻开一摞材料，接着说，今日的“两难”并非头次遇到。１９８５年，针对当时经济过热，曾采取了总量紧缩方针，但到１９８６年初就招来一片抱怨声，甚至理论界也有人以紧缩造成“国民收入巨额损失”为由，反对紧缩。其结果是银根全面放松，过热的经济尚未“软着陆”又重新腾起。１９８７年第４季度再次紧缩也未能坚持下去，致使通货膨胀日益加剧。去年３月，在一次会议上，刘国光郑重地做了“正视通货膨胀”的发言。现在，他认为警钟仍需长鸣，问题仍应正视。
    “为什么会一紧就叫，一叫就松，一松就胀呢？”
    刘国光说：“这与一种似是而非的理论有关。这种理论认为，治理经济环境不能着眼于压缩总需求，而应着力于增加总供给。但是，剖析近几年国民经济，造成总量失衡主要根源是总需求过旺，而不是总供给不足。总供给在统计上表现为产值速度，从这些年每年递增１０％以上的工业速度来看，总供给的增长是不低的。我们现在遇到能源、原材料、外汇、资金的‘瓶颈’，正反映出相对于我国目前资源的承受能力来说，工业生产的总供给绝对量不是过少而是过多，问题在于供给结构不合理。所以，笼统地提增加总供给，就等于在已经过热的经济上加热，这显然是不妥的‘药方’正确的办法应是在控制需求总量上釜底抽薪，同时，调整供给结构，以增加真正的有效供给。”
    说到增加有效供给，刘国光说，紧缩时期应当是进行结构调整的大好时机。我们要充分利用这个时机，灵活调度资金，灵活运用信贷、财政政策，支持那些真正提供有效供给的企业增加生产，进而优化产业结构、产品结构和企业结构。至于那些重复建设、重复引进、效益低下、浪费资源的工厂，则应像挤脓包一样坚决挤掉、淘汰掉。否则，如果不抓紧时机对不合理的、低效的经济结构进行大的调整，经济机体的沉疴必将在持续的通货膨胀中加重加剧，有可能演变为长期滞胀。这是我们应当竭力避免的。
    实现治理经济环境的目标，是需要付出相当代价的。刘国光认为目前有一种不正确的心态令人担忧，那就是大家都想不伤筋动骨，在歌舞升平的景象中舒舒服服地趟过经济的低谷。这样的精神状态，难以承受紧缩的考验。比如社会集团消费，人人皆知需要压缩，但又不愿压缩到自己头上。去年年初计划压缩２０％，实际执行的结果反而比前年增长２０％多。如果各项紧缩措施照此执行，也会名紧实松，欲减实增，收效甚微。因此，从现在起，上上下下都要做好承受局部的暂时的痛苦的思想准备。企业办不好要关停并转；产品没有竞争力要被淘汰。紧缩的过程，势必成为扶优限劣，择优汰劣的过程。当然，紧缩期间，在社会保障制度、公共福利制度和公平分配政策（包括税制改革）等方面必须加快改革步伐，建立必要制度，以期缓解倒闭和失业给部分人员带来的困难，激发全体人员的积极性。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　本报记者　董焕亮
