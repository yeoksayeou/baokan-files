Li Peng, the Premier of the State Council, hosted a banquet tonight at the Great Hall of the People to warmly welcome Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan's official visit to China.

In his speech at the banquet, Li Peng said that the friendly neighborly relations between China and Thailand, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, are increasingly demonstrating their vitality. He noted that in recent years, Thailand has achieved remarkable economic development, with many experiences worth learning from.

He reiterated China's position on the Cambodian issue and highly appreciated the positive role played by Thailand and other ASEAN countries. He said, "The Chinese government will, as always, strengthen cooperation with Thailand and other ASEAN countries and continue to work towards an early resolution of the Cambodian issue."

Li Peng also reiterated China's commitment to the four principles for developing relations with ASEAN countries. He said, "Not long ago, we reached a three-point agreement with Indonesia on the normalization of relations between the two countries. The process of normalizing relations between China and Indonesia has begun. We appreciate President Suharto's decisive decision. We believe that the normalization of relations between China and Indonesia on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference will not only serve the interests of the peoples of China and Indonesia but will also have a positive impact on strengthening friendship between China and ASEAN countries and maintaining peace and stability in the region."

Chatchai, in his speech, said, "The close relationship between Thailand and China is a model for other countries in the world, showing that political ideologies and differences do not constitute any obstacle to the development of friendly and constructive relations between countries."

When discussing the Cambodian issue, Chatchai said, "Vietnam should honor its commitments to the international community and withdraw its troops from Cambodia as soon as possible. At the same time, the four factions in Cambodia should strive to come closer together, and in coordinating the interests of all parties, they should prioritize the overall interests and future of the Cambodian people, adopting the greatest flexibility to achieve a national reconciliation led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk." He reiterated that Thailand will do its utmost to restore peace to Cambodia and the region as soon as possible.

Those who attended the banquet included Li Peng's wife, Zhu Lin, Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Rong Yiren, State Councilor and Minister of National Defense Qinhuai, Secretary-General of the State Council Luogan, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen. Chatchai's wife and Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila also attended the banquet.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 15th.

This morning, Li Peng held a formal meeting with Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan in a friendly and cordial atmosphere. Both sides exchanged views on the Cambodian issue and bilateral relations.

Li Peng said, "China's domestic policy is for construction; its foreign policy is for peace." When discussing the Cambodian issue, he said, "China supports the three resistance forces in Cambodia against Vietnamese aggression. Currently, the easing of the international situation is conducive to the resolution of the Cambodian issue. The key to the Cambodian issue is that Vietnam must truly withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of September this year and establish a four-party interim joint government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk."

Chatchai said that Thailand's greatest goal regarding the Cambodian issue is to bring peace back to Cambodia. This is also the common goal of Thailand and China.

Chatchai expressed that Thailand continues to support Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the three resistance forces in Cambodia, and Thailand has not recognized the Hun Sen-Heng Samrin regime as Vietnam has propagated.

Both sides were satisfied with the good development of Sino-Thai relations. Both sides exchanged in-depth views on how to further develop bilateral relations, including economic and trade relations, especially on the development of Hainan Province. Before the meeting, Li Peng and Chatchai also held a small-scale meeting.

Those who participated in the formal meeting included Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Minister of Health and head of the Chinese delegation Chen Minzhang, and Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila.

Before the meeting, Li Peng held a grand ceremony to welcome Chatchai at the East Gate Plaza of the Great Hall of the People.

　　李鹏欢宴差猜　中泰总理会谈
    双方表示加强合作致力解决柬埔寨问题
    本报北京３月１５日讯  记者温宪报道：国务院总理李鹏今晚在人民大会堂举行宴会，热烈欢迎泰国总理差猜对我国进行正式访问。
    李鹏在宴会讲话中说，建立在和平共处五项原则基础上的中泰睦邻友好关系越来越显示其旺盛的生命力。他说，近年来，泰国经济取得了令人瞩目的发展，有许多经验值得我们借鉴。
    他重申了中国政府在柬埔寨问题上的立场，并高度评价泰国和其它东盟国家在柬埔寨问题上所发挥的积极作用。他说：“中国政府将一如既往，加强同泰国以及其它东盟国家的合作，为早日解决柬埔寨问题而继续努力。”
    李鹏还重申中国将坚定不移地恪守发展同东盟各国关系的四项原则。他说：“不久前，我们同印度尼西亚就实现两国关系正常化问题达成了三点意见。中国、印尼关系正常化的进程已经开始。我们对苏哈托总统阁下的果断决策表示赞赏。我们相信，中国、印尼关系在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议十项原则的基础上实现正常化，不仅符合中国、印尼两国人民的利益，而且对加强中国同东盟国家的友谊，对维护本地区的和平与稳定将产生积极的影响。”
    差猜总理在讲话中说：“泰中间的亲密关系是世界其它国家的楷模，它说明了政治理想和主义的差异，并没有成为国与国之间相互发展友好和建设性关系的任何障碍。”
    在谈到柬埔寨问题时，差猜总理说：“越南应该遵守其向国际社会宣布的诺言，尽早从柬埔寨全部撤军。同时，柬埔寨四方应该努力相互靠拢，在协调各方利益中，应以柬埔寨人民的整体利益和前途为最高目标，从而采取最大的灵活态度，实现以西哈努克亲王为首的民族和谐。”他重申泰国方面将竭尽全力使柬埔寨和本地区早日恢复和平。
    出席宴会作陪的有李鹏总理的夫人朱琳、国务院副总理吴学谦、人大常委会副委员长荣毅仁、国务委员兼国防部长秦基伟、国务院秘书长罗干和外交部长钱其琛等。差猜总理的夫人和泰国外长西提等也出席了宴会。
    本报北京３月１５日讯　记者温宪报道：今天上午，李鹏总理在亲切友好的气氛中同泰国总理差猜·春哈旺举行了正式会谈。双方就柬埔寨等国际问题和双边关系问题交换了意见。
    李鹏说，中国的内政是为建设；外交是为和平。在谈到柬埔寨问题时，他说，中国支持柬埔寨三方抵抗力量反对越南侵略。当前，国际局势的缓和有助于柬埔寨问题的解决。柬埔寨问题的关键仍然是越南必须在今年９月底前真正从柬埔寨撤出全部军队，成立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。
    差猜总理说，在柬埔寨问题上，泰国最大的宗旨是使和平回到柬埔寨。这也是泰中两国的共同宗旨。
    差猜表示，泰国继续支持西哈努克亲王和柬三方抵抗力量的立场没有改变。泰国并没有像越南所宣传的那样承认了韩桑林—洪森政权。
    双方还对中泰关系的良好发展感到满意。双方就如何进一步发展双边关系，包括经贸关系，特别是就开发海南省的问题深入地交换了意见。在会谈前，李鹏和差猜还进行了小范围会谈。
    参加正式会谈的还有中国外长钱其琛，卫生部部长、我国陪同团团长陈敏章和泰国外长西提等。
    会谈开始前，李鹏总理在人民大会堂东门外广场举行了隆重仪式欢迎差猜总理。
