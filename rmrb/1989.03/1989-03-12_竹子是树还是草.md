It is commonly known that grass forms meadows, trees form forests, and bamboo has been called "forest" since ancient times, so it should belong to the tree category. Actually, this is not the case. The key difference between grass and trees lies in whether they have "annual rings." Woody plants add a layer of concentric rings to their cross-sections each year. However, when you cut open a young bamboo, you find it hollow inside. Based on this, it can be determined that bamboo is a "grass" rather than a "tree." Since bamboo is a grass, why does it grow so tall and have such a hard stem?

Bamboo belongs to the Poaceae family of evergreen plants and is related to "rice," "millet," "barnyard grass," and "?"! Generally, plants have only one growth point at the top of their stems, but bamboo has a growth point at the top of each "bamboo node." Therefore, "bamboo shoots after rain" can grow one meter in one night, and in Southeast Asia, they can even grow to over ten meters in a week. Its rapid growth is truly the champion of the plant kingdom.

　　竹子是树还是草
    众所周知，草发成苑，树茂成林，竹子自古称“林”，当然属于树类。其实不然，草木之别，关键是看有无“年轮”。木本植物每过一年，茎干横断面便增添一圈同心轮纹。然而剖开青竹，里面却空空如也，依此可以断定，竹子是“草”而非“树”。竹既是草，为何长得如此高大，茎干又为何如此坚硬呢？
    竹子属禾本科常绿植物，与“稻”、“黍”、“稗”、“?”等还是亲戚呢！一般的植物仅在茎干顶梢有一个生长点，而竹子每个“竹节”的顶梢均有一个生长点，所以“雨后春笋”一夜能长出１米，在东南亚甚至一周能长至十余米，其长势之迅猛，不愧为植物界的冠军。
