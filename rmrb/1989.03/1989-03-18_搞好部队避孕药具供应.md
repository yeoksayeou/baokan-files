In the past, our military's contraceptives were mainly supplied by the local family planning department according to the total number of married couples of childbearing age, free of charge. This year, the local family planning department decided to charge for the distribution of contraceptives. However, the military has not yet clarified the source of funds for this expense, making it difficult to obtain contraceptives. If the issue of contraceptive supply is not resolved, it will inevitably affect the implementation of family planning work in the military. We hope that the relevant departments will quickly come up with a solution.

　　搞好部队避孕药具供应
    过去，我们部队需要的避孕药具，大都由驻地计划生育部门按照已婚育龄夫妇的总数免费供应。今年驻地计划生育部门决定收费发放避孕药具。但是，部队现在尚未明确这笔经费来源，因而难以领到避孕药具。避孕药具供应问题不解决，势必影响部队计划生育工作的开展，希望有关部门赶快拿出办法。
