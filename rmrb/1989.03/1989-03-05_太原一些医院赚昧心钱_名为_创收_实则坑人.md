Some hospitals in Taiyuan have been making immoral profits under the guise of "income generation," actually cheating people. According to Xinhua News Agency in Taiyuan on March 4, selling aluminum pots and milk powder as medicines and arbitrarily charging for medical treatments were once the two main methods used by some hospitals in Taiyuan to generate income. After the government took strict measures to stop these practices and published the various medical treatment fees and drug prices to the public, some hospitals in the area have come up with new tricks.

The Taiyuan Daily recently revealed that one of these tricks is to increase the number of patients seen per unit of time. A farmer from Qingxu County went to a certain hospital to see a doctor. Before he could finish describing his symptoms, the doctor pushed a prescription towards him. It was found that this hospital had implemented a system where doctors' income was linked to the number of patients they saw. For each outpatient ticket a doctor issued, they would earn an additional one jiao.

Another trick is to reduce the number of patients seen during regular working hours. Some doctors push patients who could be treated during regular hours to come in during their off-hours, because during this time, both doctors and nurses can earn extra "bonuses."

A third trick is to increase bed occupancy rates. Some hospitals, whenever there are empty beds in the wards, would have patients who could be treated in the outpatient department admitted for treatment, under the pretext of "further examination."

A fourth trick is to maximize profits. Since the fee standards for each treatment item have been published, they make patients undergo multiple examinations. One patient's test results had as many as 103 sheets.

### 太原一些医院赚昧心钱  名为“创收”实则坑人

　　太原一些医院赚昧心钱
    名为“创收”实则坑人
    据新华社太原３月４日电  把铝锅、麦乳精当药品卖和乱收诊疗费曾是太原一些医院“创收”的两大法宝。在政府对此采取了严厉制止措施，并向群众公布了各种诊疗收费和药品价目后，这里一些医院又“创”出了新招。
    《太原日报》近日披露，这类招术之一是提高单位时间看病率。清徐县一农民去某医院看病，连病情还未讲完，医生便把开好的处方推了过来。经查，原来这家医院实行了医生个人收入多少与看病多少挂钩的办法，医生手里多一张门诊号，就可多拿一毛钱。
    其二是降低正常班时间看病量。一些医生把正常班里就能诊治的病人推到业余时间来看，因为在这时看病人，医生和护士都能拿到“红利”。
    其三是所谓的提高病床使用率。一些医院每当病房有空床时，就让门诊即可治疗的病人入院治疗，名曰“待查”。
    其四是以多取利。既然每个治疗项目的收费标准都公布了，那就让病人多查几次。有一位病人的化验单有１０３张之多。
