Last October, Suzhou City in Anhui Province used legislative means to establish a People's Education Foundation, raising over 300,000 yuan by the end of the year. It is expected that over 1 million yuan will be raised this year.

This education foundation was established according to the "Measures for Raising Education Funds through Multiple Channels" passed by the municipal People's Congress. The "Measures" stipulate: 20% of the annual local fiscal surplus, not less than 50% of the county fiscal surplus, and not less than 10% of the urban construction maintenance tax should be included in the education fund; 10% of the value of state-controlled commodities purchased must be paid as an educational surcharge; each resident and villager under the jurisdiction of the streets must contribute 0.5 yuan per person per month, etc. After the "Measures" were announced, the city's leading cadres took the lead in donating 2,502 yuan, and the residents of the entire city also enthusiastically paid their contributions.

　　宿州市立法兴教
    各行各业都得筹资
    居民村民人人缴款
    新华社合肥３月２日电  （记者沈祖润、通讯员牛正华）去年１０月，安徽省宿州市运用立法手段，成立了人民教育基金会，年底就筹得资金３０多万元，预计今年将筹集资金百万元以上。
    这个教育基金会是根据市人大通过的《多渠道筹措教育基金办法》成立的。这个《办法》规定：市每年地方机动财力的２０％、乡财政提成不低于５０％、城市建设维护税不低于１０％，纳入教育基金；凡购置国家控购商品，均交纳总值的１０％的教育附加费；凡街道辖区的居民、村民，按户口每人每月集资０．５元等。《办法》公布后，市里领导干部带头捐资２５０２元，全市居民也踊跃缴款。
