Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 16th.

The National Bureau of Statistics Rural Survey Team has provided information to this news agency: This year, China's grain sowing area will increase by approximately 20 million mu compared to last year.

Due to the significant rise in grain market prices in the latter half of last year, coupled with the state's further increase in grain procurement prices, increased agricultural investment, and improved agricultural production material supply methods, farmers' enthusiasm for grain production has been somewhat boosted.

　　我国粮食播种面积今年增加二千万亩
    据新华社北京３月１６日电  国家统计局农村调查总队向本社提供信息：今年我国粮食播种面积将比上年增加２０００万亩左右。
    由于去年下半年粮食集市价格有较大幅度上升，加上国家进一步调高粮食收购价格，增加农业投入，改善农业生产资料供应办法，农民种粮的积极性有所提高。
