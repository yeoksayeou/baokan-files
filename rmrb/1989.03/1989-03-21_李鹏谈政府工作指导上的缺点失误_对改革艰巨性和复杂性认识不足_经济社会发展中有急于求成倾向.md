Li Peng said in his government work report that while we have achieved successes in various areas of work, we have also encountered situations such as significant inflation and excessive price increases. These situations are related to the fact that during the transition from the old to the new system, it is not possible to quickly form a new mechanism of self-regulation and self-restraint. However, at the same time, there have been shortcomings and mistakes in our guidance of work. Overall, in economic construction and social development, there is a tendency to seek quick results.

Li Peng said, our country is a developing country and needs a certain economic growth rate, but we often overlook the actual situation of a large population, relatively scarce resources, and significant imbalances in economic development. In our guidance, we have not paid enough attention to preventing and correcting phenomena such as blindly expanding the scale of construction, one-sidedly pursuing output and quantity, and competing for development speed. The direction of reform is correct, and overall it has been successful, but in our guidance, we often have an insufficient understanding of the arduousness and complexity of reform, pay insufficient attention to comprehensive coordination, and in the process of insisting on decentralization and activation, we have not timely strengthened management and supervision or established a macro-control system. We formulated the policy of stabilizing the economy and deepening reform at the beginning of last year, but due to an overly optimistic assessment of the economic situation in 1987, our actions were not resolute and our measures were not effective. We recognize the important position of price reform in the overall economic system reform, but in actual work, we have not sufficiently considered the capacity of the state, enterprises, and the masses to bear the changes, and in the face of already obvious inflation, we have not taken timely and effective measures to stabilize finance and control prices. Instead, we have relaxed and adjusted the prices of some commodities, which has exacerbated the public's panic over price increases and triggered commodity hoarding and a decline in savings in many places.

　　李鹏谈政府工作指导上的缺点失误        
    对改革艰巨性和复杂性认识不足        
    经济社会发展中有急于求成倾向
    新华社北京３月２０日电  李鹏总理在政府工作报告中说，我们在各项工作取得成绩的同时，也出现了通货膨胀明显、物价上涨幅度过大的情况，这些情况的产生，是同新旧体制转换时期还不可能很快形成一套自我调节、自我约束的新机制分不开的。但与此同时，我们在对工作的指导上也有缺点和失误。总的来看，在经济建设和社会发展中，存在着急于求成的倾向。
    李鹏说，我们的国家是发展中国家，需要有一定的经济增长速度，但我们往往忽视国家人口众多、资源相对短缺、经济发展很不平衡的实际情况，在指导上对盲目扩大建设规模、片面追求产值产量、攀比发展速度等现象注意防止和纠正不够。改革的方向是正确的，总体上是成功的，但我们在指导上往往对改革的艰巨性和复杂性认识不足，注意综合配套不够，在坚持放权搞活的过程中，未能及时加强管理监督和抓紧建立宏观调控体系。我们在去年初制定了稳定经济、深化改革的方针，但由于后来对１９８７年经济形势的估价过于乐观，因此在执行中行动不坚决，措施不得力。我们认识到了价格改革在整个经济体制改革中的重要地位，但在实际工作中对国家、企业和群众的承受能力考虑不够，在通货膨胀已经比较明显的情况下没有及时采取稳定金融、控制物价的有力措施，又放开、调整了一些商品价格，以致加剧了群众对物价上涨的恐慌心理，在许多地方诱发了商品抢购和储蓄下降。
