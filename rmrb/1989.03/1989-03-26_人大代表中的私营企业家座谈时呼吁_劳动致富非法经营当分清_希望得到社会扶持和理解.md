	Private entrepreneurs among the deputies to the Seventh National People's Congress (NPC) held a discussion today, calling for a clear distinction between legal labor-driven wealth accumulation and illegal operations, and expressing their hope for societal support and understanding.

	New China News Agency, Beijing, March 25 -- "We need the country's support, we need society's understanding," these words from some private entrepreneurs attending the Second Session of the Seventh NPC may reflect the common aspirations of the more than 20 million individual business owners nationwide.

	This morning, the Economic Bureau of the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China specially invited five private entrepreneurs who are NPC deputies for a discussion to hear their opinions and voices.

	The five representatives are: Hu Dapeng, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Individual Industrial and Commercial Enterprises and head of Beijing Guangwei Electrical Appliances Service Department; Guo Yuanying, Director of Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, Zhongyuan District, Gouzhuang Township Textile Accessories Factory; Zhu Chengyou, Manager of Hefei City, Anhui Province, Bantou Township Chengyou Logistics Company; Zhou Qingjiang, Director of Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province, Ecological Agriculture Experimental Station; and Lai Yongxing, Director of Gutian County, Fujian Province, Yuyi Cement Factory.

	In their speeches, these representatives mentioned that many people see individual business owners as merely making money, but few recognize the contributions they make to society. Hu Dapeng revealed that last year, individual business owners nationwide donated a total of 80 million yuan to society. The other representatives also mentioned that the development of the individual economy not only facilitates people's lives and fills gaps, but also makes significant contributions to public welfare. Examples of building water and electricity facilities, supporting education, constructing roads, and building theaters are countless.

	During the meeting, these representatives complained that people often direct the blame for social inequities towards individual business owners. They believe that there should be a strict distinction between legal labor-driven wealth accumulation and illegal operations for profit. The vast majority of individual business owners are law-abiding, and only a small number engage in illegal operations, tax evasion, speculation, and monopolistic practices. It is unfair to attribute the actions of a few lawbreakers to the broader community of individual laborers. They hope that media outlets will report on them truthfully, helping society to have a correct understanding and recognition of them.

　　人大代表中的私营企业家座谈时呼吁        
    劳动致富非法经营当分清        
    希望得到社会扶持和理解
    新华社北京３月２５日电  （记者何平）“我们需要国家的扶持，我们需要社会的理解”，出席七届全国人大二次会议的一些私营企业家的这番话，也许代表了全国２０００多万个体经营者的共同心声。
    今天上午，中共中央统战部经济局特意邀请了人大代表中五位私营企业家座谈，听取他们的意见和呼声。
    这五位代表是：全国个体劳动者协会副会长、北京光伟电器服务部负责人胡大鹏，河南省郑州市中原区沟赵乡纺织配件厂厂长郭元英，安徽省来安县半塔镇成友联运公司经理朱成友，浙江省平阳县生态农业试验场场长周青疆，福建省上杭县古田友谊水泥厂厂长赖永兴。
    在发言中，这些代表谈到，对于个体户，许多人只看到我们赚钞票，却很少有人想到个体户对社会的贡献。胡大鹏代表披露了这样一个数字：去年全国个体户一共向社会捐款八千万元。其他几位代表也谈到，个体经济的发展，不仅方便了人民生活，起到了拾遗补缺的作用，而且为社会公益事业作出不少贡献。修水电，办教育，筑公路，盖剧院，个人富了不忘国家群众的事例不胜枚举。
    会上，这些代表抱怨：人们往往把社会分配不公的矛头对准个体户。对此，这些代表认为，应该严格区别依法劳动致富和非法经营牟取暴利的界限。绝大多数个体户是遵纪守法的，非法经营、偷税漏税、倒买倒卖、欺行霸市的只是极少数，不应该把少数不法分子的行为加在广大个体劳动者身上。他们希望新闻单位实事求是地对他们进行宣传报道，使社会对他们有个正确的认识和了解。
