The second session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held in Beijing from March 19 to 27, 1989. Delegates from various political parties, people's organizations, and sectors gathered to speak freely, express their views, actively participate in political consultation and deliberation, and discuss national affairs. The conference adhered to seeking truth from facts, promoted democratic practices, and embodied the spirit of unity and struggle.

The conference listened to and endorsed the government work report delivered by Premier Li Peng at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the report on the draft national economic and social development plan for 1989 by Vice Premier and Minister of the State Planning Commission Yao Yilin, and the report on the execution of the 1988 national budget and the draft 1989 national budget by State Councilor and Minister of Finance Wang Bingqian. The conference believed that Premier Li Peng's exposition on the significant historical changes in China over the past decade, the initial achievements of the rectification and adjustment since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the current problems and difficulties, and the mistakes in the work was in line with reality. The conference also believed that the policies and arrangements for rectification and adjustment and deepening reform proposed in the report were feasible. The conference hoped that the State Council would further summarize experiences, formulate more complete and specific measures to solve the existing problems, and ensure the implementation of the policies and arrangements for rectification and adjustment and deepening reform. The conference also hoped that the State Council would pay full attention to the opinions and suggestions raised by the delegates on socialist material civilization, socialist spiritual civilization, socialist democratic legal construction, especially agriculture, prices, education, population, ecological environment, and clean government, and solve them step by step.

The conference firmly supported Premier Li Peng's stance on opposing secession and maintaining national unity and ethnic solidarity in the government work report. The conference strongly condemned the U.S. Senate and the European Parliament's gross interference in China's internal affairs regarding the so-called Tibet issue. The conference solemnly declared that China's affairs can only be managed by the Chinese people themselves, and any foreign forces intervening in China's internal affairs in any form are unacceptable.

The conference believed that since the first session of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has played an active role in rectification and adjustment and deepening reform through performing its functions of political consultation and democratic supervision. The conference required that the people's political consultative conferences at all levels continue to uphold the banner of socialism and patriotism, adhere to the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, widely connect with people from all walks of life, consolidate and develop a stable and united political situation, and strive to create a good social and political environment for rectification and adjustment and deepening reform. The conference also required that the people's political consultative conferences at all levels and delegates actively carry out political consultation and democratic supervision around the central tasks of the state, put forward ideas, think of ways, offer suggestions, make criticisms, and support and assist the government in doing a good job. The conference called on the people's political consultative conferences and delegates at all levels to boost their spirits, enhance their confidence, unite as one, pool their wisdom and strength, work hard, and make new contributions to the cause of socialist modernization and the promotion of national reunification!
