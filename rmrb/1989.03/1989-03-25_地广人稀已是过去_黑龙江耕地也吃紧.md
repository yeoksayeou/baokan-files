Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, March 24th.

Once known nationwide for its vast lands and sparse population, Heilongjiang Province now faces a different reality: the population has grown, and arable land has become scarce.

A set of figures provides evidence: from the early days of liberation to the present, the province's arable land area has only increased by 50%, while the population has grown by 2.4 times, with per capita arable land decreasing from 8.5 mu to 4 mu.

People have not forgotten that, whether before liberation or in the 1950s and 1960s, whenever there was a famine in the interior, many people would "rush to the East." Today, if one were to try to settle in the same way as before, it would not be so easy to find a place to stand.

It is understood that Heilongjiang Province's land management and family planning work are both relatively advanced in the country. Nevertheless, officials from these two departments still lament: the reclamation of arable land is far from keeping up with the rate of population growth. Currently, Heilongjiang Province has 170 million mu of arable land that can be reclaimed, but this is a fixed number, while population growth is a dynamic figure. They calculate that it won't be long before the arable land is fully reclaimed, and at that time, the per capita arable land will decrease even more significantly.

What will happen in the future? Officials from relevant departments told reporters that, on the one hand, efforts must continue to promote family planning, and on the other hand, efforts must be made to deepen and broaden agricultural production. Heilongjiang is a major commercial grain base in the country, and the responsibility is great.

### 地广人稀已是过去  黑龙江耕地也吃紧

　　地广人稀已是过去        
    黑龙江耕地也吃紧
    新华社哈尔滨３月２４日电  （记者张持坚、刘玉勋）曾以地广人稀闻名全国的黑龙江省，如今人不稀、地也不广了。
    一组数字提供了佐证：从解放初到现在，这个省的耕地面积只扩大５０％，而人口却增长了２．４倍，人均占有耕地由８．５亩下降到４亩。
    人们没有忘记，不管是解放前，还是五六十年代，关内一遇灾荒，就会有不少人“闯关东”。今天，若再像当年那样闯来，可就不那么容易找到立足之地了。
    据了解，黑龙江省土地管理和计划生育工作在全国都是比较先进的。尽管如此，这两个主管部门的同志都慨叹：开垦耕地远远赶不上人口增长的速度。目前，黑龙江省可开垦耕地还有１７００万亩，但这是个死数，而人口增长是个活数。他们计算的结果，用不了很长时间，可耕地开垦完了，到那时人均占有耕地下降的幅度将会更大。
    今后怎么办？有关方面负责人告诉记者，一方面要继续搞好计划生育，另一方面要在农业生产的深度和广度上做文章。黑龙江是全国的商品粮基地，责任重大。
