The State Council recently issued a notice requiring all regions and departments to rectify and clean up various types of foreign economic and trade companies.

1. Except for a few foreign trade companies directly authorized by the State Council to undertake certain government administrative management functions, all other foreign trade companies with government administrative management functions shall be abolished.

2. The business scope of various foreign trade companies approved since 1988 shall be re-examined.

3. Foreign trade companies that are operationally chaotic and have very poor economic benefits shall be rectified within a specified period. Depending on the situation, they shall be dissolved, merged, or have their import and export business rights revoked. Foreign trade companies whose import and export business rights have been revoked shall complete the execution of original contracts or entrust agents for import and export, and shall not sign new import and export contracts with external parties.

4. The role of original provincial-level foreign trade companies as the main channel for external operations shall be fully utilized, and the import and export agency system shall be actively promoted.

5. Various international economic and technological cooperation companies engaged in foreign contract engineering, labor cooperation, and production technology cooperation shall be rectified within a specified period if they lack funding, do not meet the conditions for an economic entity, or engage in illegal operations after establishment. Unauthorized companies shall not engage in foreign contract engineering and labor cooperation business. A few companies that need to be retained shall complete the approval procedures.

The State Council requires all regions and departments to take the rectification and cleanup of various foreign trade companies as an important task and to ensure it is carried out effectively.

　　国务院通知清理外贸公司
    主要解决政企不分官商不分违法经营等问题
    新华社北京３月８日电  国务院最近发出通知，要求各地区、各部门对各类对外经济贸易公司进行清理整顿。主要解决政企不分、官商不分、违法经营、业务脱节、经营紊乱等问题。
    主要内容如下：
    一、除国务院直接授权承担某些政府行政管理职能的少数对外经贸公司外，其他各类对外经贸公司凡有政府行政管理职能的，一律予以取消。
    二、重新核定１９８８年以来批准设立的各类外贸公司的业务范围。
    三、凡经营混乱、经济效益很差的各类外贸公司，限期予以整顿，分别情况，予以撤销、合并或取消其进出口经营权。被取消进出口经营权的外贸公司，原签订合同执行完毕或委托代理进出口后，不得对外签订新的进出口合同。
    四、要充分发挥原有省属外贸公司对外经营的主渠道作用，积极推行进出口代理制。
    五、经营对外承包工程、劳务合作、生产技术合作业务的各类国际经济技术合作公司，属于资金不落实、不具备经济实体条件，成立后不能正常开展业务或违法经营的，各地方、各部门应限期整顿，予以撤销或合并。凡未经国务院或经贸部批准的公司，不得经营对外承包工程和劳务合作业务，少数须保留的公司，要补办报批手续。
    国务院要求各地方、各部门，把清理整顿各类对外经贸公司作为清理整顿公司的一项重要任务，切实抓好。
