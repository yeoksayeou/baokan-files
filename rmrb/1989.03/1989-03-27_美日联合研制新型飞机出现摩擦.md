Recent developments have seen friction emerge between the United States and Japan over their joint development of the FSX new-type fighter jet.

The joint development of the new fighter jet was a deal reached between the Reagan administration and Japan in the latter half of last year. The FSX is an improved version of the F-16 fighter jet. According to the memorandum of understanding signed during the last round of negotiations, the United States will provide technical data for the F-16 fighter jet. The General Dynamics Corporation of the United States and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan will undertake the development work. General Dynamics Corporation will receive 40% of the $1.3 billion development fee.

Now, this agreement has met with strong opposition from the U.S. Congress and the Department of Commerce. Bipartisan members of Congress believe that this agreement will allow Japan to acquire advanced U.S. aerospace technology, helping it establish its own aerospace industry and thus directly compete with the United States in a field where the U.S. has long held an absolute advantage. An editorial in The New York Times called for the cancellation of this agreement. Meanwhile, the Department of Defense, which participated in the negotiations for this agreement, believes that given Japan's refusal to purchase the F-16 fighter jet, this is the best possible deal under the circumstances.

President Bush recently stated that he personally advocates for the execution of the agreement but that the memorandum of understanding needs to be clarified and some restrictive clauses added, such as prohibiting Japan from using the technology to manufacture civilian aircraft. Bush stated that he will submit this agreement to Congress.

Japan is very dissatisfied with the U.S.'s change of heart and demands that the U.S. honor the agreement. Japanese defense officials refuse to make any modifications to the agreement.

The United States has long encouraged and demanded that Japan take on more responsibility for defense in the Pacific region. The joint development of the FSX fighter jet is obviously also based on this consideration. It is rather ironic that after two years of negotiations, Japan signed this agreement under U.S. pressure.

The U.S.'s change of heart is obviously due to economic considerations. Japan has long been a major competitor to the U.S. in many technological fields. In aerospace technology, the only other competitor to the U.S. is Europe. If Japan one day competes with the U.S. in this field for market share, it would be unthinkable for the U.S. The debate surrounding the FSX fighter jet reflects these concerns.

### 美日联合研制新型飞机出现摩擦

　　美日联合研制新型飞机出现摩擦
    最近，美国和日本在联合研制ＦＳＸ新型战斗机的问题上出现了摩擦。
    联合研制新型战斗机是里根政府去年下半年同日本谈判达成的一项协议。ＦＳＸ是一种改进型的Ｆ１６型战斗机。按上一次双方签署的谅解备忘录，美国将为研制这种战斗机提供Ｆ１６型战斗机的技术资料。美国通用动力公司和日本的三菱重工业公司承担研制工作。通用动力公司可得１３亿美元研制费中４０％的订货。
    现在，这项协议受到了国会和美国商务部的极力反对。国会中两党议员都认为，这一协议将使日本获得美国的先进航空工业技术，有助其建立自己的航空工业，从而让日本在一个美国迄今一直占有绝对优势的领域里同美国直接抗衡。《纽约时报》的一篇评论要求政府取消这一协议。而参与这项协议谈判的国防部则认为，由于日本拒绝购买Ｆ１６型战斗机，在此情况下，这是一笔可能得到的最好交易。
    布什总统最近表示，他本人主张执行协议，但要对谅解备忘录作出澄清，增加一些限制性的条款，如不许日本把制造战斗机的技术用于制造民用飞机等。布什表示将把这一协议提交国会。
    日本对美国出尔反尔十分不满，要求美国信守协议。日本防务省官员不同意对协议作任何修改。
    美国一贯鼓励、要求日本在太平洋地区的防务中承担更多的责任。联合研制ＦＳＸ战斗机显然也是出于这一考虑。颇有讽刺意味的是，经过历时两年的谈判，日本是在美国的压力下签署这一协议的。
    美国改变初衷，显然是出于经济利益的考虑。日本早已在很多技术领域成为美国的主要竞争对手。在航空技术方面，能同美国竞争的暂时只有欧洲。如果日本有朝一日在这一领域同美国争夺市场，对美国来说将是不堪设想的。美国围绕ＦＳＸ战斗机事件的争论正是反映了上述忧虑。
