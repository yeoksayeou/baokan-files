The feasibility study of the Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze River, which lasted two years and eight months, was completed today amidst sharp disagreements between two opposing viewpoints. The feasibility study leadership group has, in principle, approved a research report that holds a positive view on the project's feasibility. It is reported that this research report will be submitted to the State Council after some technical modifications and supplements.

The 10th expanded meeting of the Three Gorges Project Feasibility Study Leadership Group, which began on February 27, was held after 14 expert groups, comprising over 400 experts, completed their respective thematic studies and submitted a comprehensive report to the "Long Office." This 150,000-character report, titled "Feasibility Study of the Yangtze River Three Gorges Hydropower Project," discusses the necessity, technical feasibility, and economic rationality of constructing the Three Gorges Project from various aspects, including its role in the Yangtze River Basin planning, engineering schemes, technical feasibility, reservoir submergence and resettlement of affected people, environmental impact assessment, investment estimation, and comprehensive economic evaluation. The report suggests that the state should arrange for the construction of the project as soon as economic conditions permit.

During the meeting, 10 members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and some invited consultants expressed different opinions on the report. One viewpoint was fundamentally opposed to the Three Gorges Project, arguing that it should not be built. The majority of the differing opinions suggested that, given the project's enormous scale and concentrated investment, it would not yield benefits within this century and should therefore be postponed. Some members of the National Committee pointed out that, given the current economic rectification situation, if this super-large-scale project were to be forcibly undertaken, it would inevitably have serious adverse effects on the national economy.

The head of the feasibility study leadership group stated that the feasibility study of the Three Gorges Project is merely to provide a scientific basis for national decision-making. Whether to build the Three Gorges Project and when to build it will be decided by the State Council's review committee. According to the predetermined procedure, if this project is to proceed, it will need to be discussed by the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and submitted to the National People's Congress for deliberation.

The chairperson of the feasibility study meeting stated that when submitting the report, all differing opinions will be included.

It is reported that, in addition to the feasibility study conducted by domestic experts, the feasibility study of the Three Gorges Project independently conducted by the Canadian International Consulting Company has also been completed. Their research report also holds a positive attitude.

　　三峡工程论证工作全部完成
    两种不同意见依然尖锐对立 
    工程是否上马有待中央决策
    本报北京３月７日讯  记者杨良化、王彦田报道：历时两年零８个月的长江三峡工程论证工作，今天在两种不同意见的尖锐对立中全部完成。论证领导小组原则通过了对工程可行性持积极肯定态度的研究报告。据透露，这份研究报告将在作某些技术性的修改和补充后，上报国务院。
    从２月２７日开始的三峡工程论证领导小组第十次扩大会议，是在１４个专家组的４００多位专家分别完成各个专题的研究论证后，集中百余专家审议由“长办”提交的综合报告。这份长达１５万字的《长江三峡水利枢纽可行性研究报告》，分别从三峡工程在长江流域规划中的地位与作用、工程方案、技术可行性、水库淹没与移民安置、环境影响评价、投资估算、综合经济评价等方面，论述了兴建三峡工程的必要性、技术可行性、经济合理性。论证报告建议国家在经济条件容许的情况下尽快安排建设。
    会上，１０位全国政协委员及部分特邀顾问对报告提出了不同意见，一种是对三峡工程从根本上表示反对，认为不能修建。多数不同意见则认为，考虑到工程规模巨大、投资集中，本世纪内又不能发挥效益，必须推迟修建。有的政协委员指出，在当前整治经济的形势下，如果硬上这项超大型工程，必然给国民经济带来严重不利影响。
    论证领导小组负责人认为，三峡工程的论证工作，仅仅是为国家决策提供一个科学依据。至于三峡工程究竟建不建，什么时间建，要由国务院审查委员会作出抉择。按照预定程序，这项工程如要上马，还需经党中央政治局讨论，并提交全国人民代表大会审议。
    论证会主持人表示，在向上提交报告时，将把不同意见一并上报。
    据悉，在国内专家可行性论证以外，由加拿大国际咨询公司独立进行的三峡工程可行性研究也已完成。他们提出的研究报告也持肯定态度。
