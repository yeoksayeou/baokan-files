Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 16th.

Students from 38 universities affiliated with the General Student Council of the Seoul region held rallies on March 15th, unanimously demanding the resignation of Roh Tae-woo.

Currently, the struggle of South Korean youth students against Roh Tae-woo may combine with the Democratic Party's "anti-Roh" movement, which will have an impact on the political situation in South Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, March 16th.

The opposition Democratic Party of South Korea passed a resolution at a full meeting of its officials on March 15th, calling for Roh Tae-woo to step down.

The resolution stated that if the Roh Tae-woo regime continues to exist, it will be impossible to investigate the corruption cases during the Chun Doo-hwan administration and to achieve genuine democratization.

The resolution also strongly condemned Roh Tae-woo's upcoming "mid-term evaluation" as a deceptive act against the people. It said that the Democratic Party will unite with the people to launch a campaign of no confidence against Roh Tae-woo.

　　南朝鲜学生集会　民主党通过决议
    要求卢泰愚下台
    新华社平壤３月１６日电  汉城消息：汉城地区总学生联合会所属的３８所大学的学生１５日分别举行誓师大会，一致要求卢泰愚下台。
    目前，南朝鲜青年学生反对卢泰愚的斗争有可能同在野的民主党的“倒卢”运动结合在一起，这将对南朝鲜政局产生影响。
    新华社平壤３月１６日电　汉城消息：南朝鲜在野的民主党１５日在全体干部会上通过了一项旨在要求卢泰愚引退的决议。
    决议指出，如果卢泰愚政权继续存在，就不可能清算全斗焕执政时期的舞弊案，也不可能实现真正的民主化政治。
    这项决议还严厉谴责卢泰愚将要实施的“中间评价”是欺骗国民的行为。它说，民主党将和国民团结一致，开展对卢泰愚的不信任斗争。
