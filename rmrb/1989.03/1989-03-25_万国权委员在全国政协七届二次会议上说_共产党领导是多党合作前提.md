	Wan Guoquan, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, spoke at the second session of the seventh CPPCC National Committee. He emphasized that the Communist Party's leadership is the prerequisite for multi-party cooperation.

	Wan Guoquan's speech was divided into three parts. In the first part, titled "On Upholding the Communist Party's Leadership in Multi-Party Cooperation," he explained why multi-party cooperation still requires the Communist Party's leadership. He pointed out that multi-party cooperation is a form of political cooperation, and the Communist Party's leadership is political leadership. He stated that all political parties, including the Communist Party of China, are equal in status and independent in organization. Therefore, they must have a common political line and policies to guide their cooperation, otherwise, they would lack a common political goal and decision-making process, and political cooperation would lose its content and basis. In other words, without a political core and leadership, multi-party political cooperation in China is not feasible.

	Next, he addressed who should exercise this political leadership and act as the chief architect of the common political line, principles, and policies. He noted that the Chinese people, through long-term political practice, have chosen the Communist Party of China. This leadership is not self-proclaimed by the Communist Party nor imposed on the Chinese people; it is a choice made by the Chinese people through long-term historical practice. The democratic parties in China did not recognize the Communist Party's political leadership from their inception; rather, they made this choice after a long, winding journey and a thorough review of their experiences and lessons. This does not mean that this leadership core is without errors or mistakes. The Communist Party of China, in its struggle to become the leadership core of the Chinese people, has had successes and positive experiences, as well as failures and negative lessons. The key issue before us is how to examine its leadership position and role in such a real situation. We fully agree with Comrade Zhao Ziyang's recent statement that we should view problems dynamically. That is, we should acknowledge both its achievements and mistakes, experiences and lessons, and more importantly, understand whether it can be pragmatic in consolidating achievements, overcoming shortcomings, upholding the truth, correcting errors, and especially whether it can seriously address its own negative aspects and gain new, strong vitality in the struggle to overcome darkness. On this fundamental point, the numerous facts we have witnessed over the past decade have made us firmly believe in the Communist Party's core leadership role in multi-party cooperation.

	In the second part of his speech, Wan Guoquan elaborated on the issue of upholding multi-party cooperation. He said that the reason China has formed and will long adhere to the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party is rooted in historical causes. During the period of the new democratic revolution, the Communist Party began cooperating with democratic parties. From a practical standpoint, in the initial stage of socialism, the material interests structure of Chinese society is characterized by the fundamental unity of the laboring masses' interests and the multiplicity of specific interests of different classes, strata, and social groups. Upholding and further improving the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party is undoubtedly necessary to correctly utilize and coordinate the aforementioned multiplicity, continuously enhance the aforementioned unity, and thereby smoothly advance the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics. In short, China's system of multi-party cooperation is a product of social and historical practice, and its occurrence and development ultimately do not depend on people's subjective will. This is also the fundamental reason why we believe it must be upheld for the long term. He said that over the past 40 years of practice, generally speaking, the system of multi-party cooperation has played an important role in coordinating social contradictions, maintaining stability and unity, strengthening the construction of the state power, expanding socialist democracy, strengthening and improving the leadership of the Communist Party, promoting economic construction, and promoting the implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy, among other areas, and has shown increasingly great superiority.

	In the third part of his speech, titled "On the Relationship Between the Communist Party's Leadership and Multi-Party Cooperation," Wan Guoquan pointed out that a distinctive feature of China's system of multi-party cooperation, compared to other multi-party systems, is that it takes the leadership of the Communist Party as a prerequisite and guarantee. With this prerequisite and guarantee, the system of multi-party cooperation has great cohesion and centripetal force, and can adhere to the socialist direction without going astray. Another distinctive feature of our political system, compared to one-party systems, is that under the leadership of the Communist Party, long-term close cooperation among multiple parties is realized. From this perspective, multi-party cooperation is also an indispensable condition and support for upholding the party's leadership. It is through the form of multi-party cooperation that the Communist Party of China connects with and unites various groups of people, concentrates the wisdom of the people, and correctly guides state affairs.

	Wan Guoquan said that one party's leadership and close multi-party cooperation run through all aspects and the entire process of our system of multi-party cooperation. Considering that there is objectively a problem of ideological preparation and capacity to accept the gradual improvement of the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party, we believe that the gradual improvement, enrichment, and development of the system of multi-party cooperation should adopt an attitude that is both active and cautious in work. Laziness leads to failure, and rushing is also not good.

### 万国权委员在全国政协七届二次会议上说  共产党领导是多党合作前提

　　万国权委员在全国政协七届二次会议上说        
    共产党领导是多党合作前提
    新华社北京３月２３日电  全国政协委员、民建中央副主席万国权今天在全国政协七届二次会议的大会发言中就多党合作制度发言说，民建认为，坚持、完善、丰富、发展共产党领导的多党合作，前提是坚持。这个前提把握好了，各个方面的认识一致了，才能在今后的不断实践中，逐步地完善它、丰富它、发展它。
    万国权的发言分三个部分。他在第一部分“关于坚持共产党对多党合作的领导”中指出，多党合作为什么还要共产党领导？要回答这个问题，首先需要明确多党合作是政治上的合作，共产党的领导是政治领导。他说，包括中国共产党在内的各个政党的地位是平等的，组织上是独立的。正因为如此，它们在政治上实行合作，就不能没有共同的政治路线和方针政策，否则它们就没有共同的政治目标、政治决策，也就失去了政治合作的内容和依据。这就是说，在我国要实行多党派的政治合作，没有政治核心，没有政治领导，是不行的。其次，谁来实行这种政治领导，即谁来充当共同的政治路线、方针、政策的总设计院？中国人民在长期的政治实践中，饱尝胜利的欢乐和失败的痛苦之后，选择了中国共产党。这个领导，不是中国共产党自封的，也不是强加给中国人民的，而是中国人民自己经过长期历史实践作出的抉择。中国民主党派确认中国共产党的政治领导也不是从它们成立开始就这样，而是在走过漫长曲折的道路，认真总结了经验教训才作出如此抉择的。这当然并不意味着这个领导核心没有一点失误或者不会犯错误。中国共产党在形成为中国人民的领导核心的斗争过程中，有过成功和正面经验，也有失败和反面教训。摆在我们面前的问题是在这样的实际情况下怎样考察它的领导地位和作用问题。我们完全赞成赵紫阳同志最近指出的要动态地看问题。即是，既要正视它的成就和失误，经验和教训，更要弄清它能否实事求是地巩固成绩、克服缺点，坚持真理、修正错误，特别是能否认真对待自己身上的消极东西，在战胜阴暗面的斗争中获得新的强大的活力。在这一根本点上，我们亲眼目睹的近十年的大量事实，使我们对于中国共产党在多党合作中的领导核心作用，仍然坚信不疑。
    万国权发言的第二部分就坚持多党合作的问题作了阐述。他说，我国之所以会形成乃至要长期坚持共产党领导的多党合作制度，从历史的原因看，早在新民主主义革命时期，共产党就开始了同民主党派的合作。从现实的根据看，在社会主义初级阶段的经济、社会状况下，我国社会物质利益结构的特点是，劳动群众根本利益的一致性和不同阶级、阶层、社会集团具体利益的多元性。坚持和进一步完善共产党领导的多党合作，无疑是正确运用、协调上述多元性，不断增强上述一致性，借以顺利进行建设有中国特色的社会主义的需要。简言之，我国的多党合作制度是社会历史实践的产物，它的发生和发展，归根到底，不取决于人们的主观意志。这也就是我们认为必须长期坚持它的根本原因。他说，纵观４０年的实践，总的说来，多党合作制在协调社会矛盾，维护安定团结方面；在加强政权建设，扩大社会主义民主方面；在加强和改善共产党的领导方面；在推动经济建设方面；在促进“一国两制”方针的实施等方面都有不容抹煞的重要作用，表现出愈来愈大的优越性。
    万国权在他发言的第三部分“关于共产党的领导同多党合作的关系”中指出，我国多党合作的政治制度不同于其它多党制国家的一个特点，是以共产党的领导为前提和保证。有了这个前提和保证，多党合作制度才有巨大的凝聚力和向心力，才能坚持社会主义方向而不致误入歧途。我们这个政治制度还有一个不同于一党制国家的特点，是在共产党领导的前提下，实行多党的长期密切合作。从这一侧面看，多党合作又是坚持党的领导的不可缺少的条件和支持。中国共产党正是通过多党合作的形式，联系和团结各部分群众，集中人民群众的智慧，正确地指导国家事务的。
    万国权说，一个共产党的领导，一个多党密切合作，贯穿于我们这个多党合作制度的各个方面和全部过程中。考虑到对于逐步完善共产党领导的多党合作制度，客观上有一个思想准备和承受能力的问题，我们认为，多党合作制度逐步完善、丰富和发展，在工作中应当持既积极又慎重的态度，懈怠则误事，过急也不行。
