After listening to the issues raised by Ma Dongming and Liu Dongxu, the reporter visited relevant departments such as the Ministry of Chemical Industry and the Ministry of Commerce. According to the relevant personnel from these departments, none of these units have imported or sold BME fluorescent brighteners.

Below is a transcript of the reporter's conversation with a relevant official from the Chemical Industry Department.

Question: Do you know about the purchase of "BME fluorescent brighteners" by the Yiliang Company in Liaoyang from the Jiangxi Jiujiang Light Industry Building Materials Company?

Answer: We are aware of it, and we have also seen the materials they submitted. This is the fourth unit to report this issue to us. According to our understanding, many units in provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions such as Guizhou, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, and Inner Mongolia have purchased this product. We sympathize with these affected units.

Question: Are the test results from the Shenyang Chemical Research Institute of the Chemical Industry Department reliable?

Answer: The Shenyang Chemical Research Institute is the chemical dye center of the Chemical Industry Department, and their tests are reliable. According to the test results, this batch of "brighteners" contains talcum powder, at least 40% or slightly more. The selling price of 1 ton of talcum powder is only a few hundred yuan, while 1 ton of BME fluorescent brighteners costs tens of thousands of yuan. Obviously, those who manufacture and sell counterfeit BME fluorescent brighteners are making money for themselves and harming users, which is a serious violation of the law. Relevant departments should pursue legal responsibility.

Question: How can users and operating units effectively avoid being deceived?

Answer: Currently, there are many import channels for chemical raw materials in China, and some users do not understand the technology, leading to many cases of deception. The multiple import channels and lack of coordination result in the inability to import necessary materials while allowing unnecessary imports. To reduce the randomness of imports and strengthen planning, the state should appropriately centralize import channels. Departments of the State Council with import rights should strictly review and approve imports, and each department should be accountable to the state. Additionally, units engaged in the operation of chemical raw materials should have personnel with chemical expertise to qualify for operation. According to our understanding, most of the units that have been deceived are non-chemical system units, which are deceived due to their lack of technical knowledge. State departments should issue licenses to qualified units to operate chemical products. Units without licenses should not be allowed to operate.

　　调查附记
    听了马东明、刘东旭反映的问题后，记者到化工部、商业部等有关部门进行了采访。据这几个部门有关负责人介绍，这几家都没有进口或销售过ＢＭＥ萤光增白剂。
    下面是记者同化工部炼化司有关负责人的一段对话。
    问：你们是否知道辽阳市益劳公司从江西九江市轻化建材公司购买“ＢＭＥ萤光增白剂”一事？
    答：知道，他们反映问题的材料也看到过。到我们这里反映这一问题，他们已是第四家了。据我们了解，全国有贵州、天津、山东、河南、内蒙古等省、市、自治区的不少单位买了这种产品，对这些受害单位我们很同情。
    问：化工部沈阳化工研究院测试的结果是否可信呢？
    答：沈阳化工研究院是化工部的化工染料中心，他们的测试是可信的。从测试结果看，这批“增白剂”中掺的是元明粉，至少加进了４０％或者更多一点。１吨元明粉的售价只有几百元，而１吨ＢＭＥ萤光增白剂几万元，显然，制造和销售假冒ＢＭＥ萤光增白剂的人自己捞钱，坑害用户，是严重违法的。有关部门应当依法追究。
    问：用户和经营单位如何才能有效地避免上当受骗呢？
    答：目前，我国化工原料的进口渠道很多，而一些用户又不懂技术，上当受骗的不少。进口渠道多，各自为政，导致该进口的进不来，不该进口的却进来了。为了减少进口的盲目性，加强计划性，今后，国家应当对进口渠道适当地集中，有进口化工原料权的国务院各部要严格审批把关，各部向国家负责。还应规定，凡是经营化工原料的单位，必须配有懂得化工技术的人员才有资格经营。据我们了解，凡上当受骗的单位，大多都是非化工系统的单位，他们因不懂技术而上当受骗。国家有关部门最好对有条件经营化工产品的单位发放许可证。未取得许可证的，一律不准经营。
