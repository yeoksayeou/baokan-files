    Breakthroughs in Neodymium-Iron-Boron Permanent Magnet Materials Research
    Sample Products Lead the World

    Beijing, March 28 (Xinhua) — Reporter Jiang Jianke reports: China's research on neodymium-iron-boron permanent magnet materials has recently made significant breakthroughs. The maximum magnetic energy product of the samples is all above 47.0 MGOe, with the highest reaching 49.0 MGOe, surpassing the levels of European and American countries (45 MGOe) and approaching Japan's world-leading laboratory level of 50.6 MGOe.

    Permanent magnet materials are high-tech functional materials that can generate magnetic energy without external power supply. They are widely used in large rockets, communication satellites, metallurgy, chemical industry, household appliances, medical equipment, and the electronics industry.

    However, the maximum magnetic energy product of both domestic and international products is below 40 MGOe. Under the support of the institute, Li Wei, Li Bo, and Yu Xiaojun, three young scientists from the Metallurgical Ministry's Steel Research Institute, undertook this key project of the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan" scientific and technological breakthrough. On February 1, they broke through the 45.7 MGOe barrier. Subsequently, they worked overtime for another month, achieving significant progress. A testing team composed of experts and professors conducted the final performance joint inspection of the samples, concluding that this batch of samples can be repeatedly produced, providing the possibility for the trial production of high-grade neodymium-iron-boron products.

　　钕铁硼永磁材料攻关见效        
    研制样品居世界领先地位
    本报北京３月２８日讯  记者蒋建科报道：我国钕铁硼永磁材料攻关最近获突破性进展。其样品最大磁能积全部在４７．０兆高奥以上，最高的达４９．０兆高奥，超过欧美各国（４５兆高奥），接近日本５０．６兆高奥的世界最高实验室水平。
    永磁材料是一种不用外部供电就能自己产生磁能的高技术功能材料，广泛用于大型火箭、通信卫星、冶金、化工、家用电器、医疗器械及电子工业等领域。
    然而，国内外生产的产品，最大磁能积均在４０兆高奥以下。冶金部钢铁研究总院的李卫、李波、喻晓军３位青年科技人员在院方支持下，承担了这个国家“七五”科技攻关重点专题。２月１日，突破了４５．７兆高奥大关。接着，他们又加班加点，经过一个月努力，取得重大进展。由专家、教授组成的测试组对样品进行了最后性能联合检定，认为这批样品能重复制作，为批量试制生产高档钕铁硼产品提供了可能。
