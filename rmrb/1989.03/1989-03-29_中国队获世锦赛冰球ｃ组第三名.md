China's ice hockey team today in the afternoon in the ice hockey stadium in the suburbs of Sydney, Australia, defeated the Asian powerhouse, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, with a score of 4:2 in the World Ice Hockey C Group Championship. With a record of 7 matches, 4 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses, the team secured third place in this tournament, maintaining its C Group level.

In today's final match, the Chinese team played intensely against the Korean team. Both teams performed at their best. Overall, the Korean team had a slight advantage in terms of speed and physical fitness, and they had more offensive opportunities than the Chinese team. However, the Chinese team's individual skills were superior, and the players were more active in their forward and midfield movements, controlling the pace of the attack and defense well. They led 2:0 in the first period and 2:1 in the second period. In the third period, both teams increased their offensive and defensive speed. The Korean team aggressively contested in the Chinese team's defensive zone, and the Chinese team's stamina began to decline, allowing the opponents to score one goal.

The final standings of the other 7 teams participating in the World Ice Hockey C Group Championship will be determined after tonight's 3 matches. Currently, both Yugoslavia and the Netherlands have 6 wins in 6 matches. Tonight, these two teams will compete for the championship and runner-up positions in this tournament.

　　中国队获世锦赛冰球Ｃ组第三名
    新华社悉尼３月２７日电  （记者许钺乃）中国冰球队今天下午在澳大利亚悉尼市郊黑城冰球场进行的世界冰球Ｃ组锦标赛中，以４∶２战胜亚洲劲旅朝鲜民主主义人民共和国队，并以７战４胜、１平、２负的成绩获得本届比赛的第三名，保持Ｃ组水平。
    中国队在今天的最后一场比赛中同朝鲜队打得紧张激烈，双方基本都发挥了自己的水平。从整体上看，朝鲜队的攻防速度和队员的身体素质都略胜于中国队，进攻次数也较中国队多。但中国队队员个人技术较好，队员在前场和中场的穿插积极，攻防节奏掌握好，在第一局和第二局比赛中分别以２∶０和２∶１领先。第三局比赛，双方都加快了攻防速度，朝鲜队在中国队的守区积极拚抢，中国队体力有所下降，被对方攻入一球。
    参加世界冰球Ｃ组锦标赛另外７个队的名次还要待今晚的３场比赛结束后才能确定。目前，南斯拉夫队和荷兰队均为６战６胜。今晚，这两个队将决出本次比赛的冠亚军。
