Yugoslav People's Army Leader Emphasizes: No One is Allowed to Toy with the Nation's Fate

	Yugoslav People's Army Troops in Kosovo on High Alert

	Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, March 4 — The commander of the Yugoslav People's Army in Pristina, General Silic, today told Yugoslav news media that the Yugoslav People's Army is resolutely defending Yugoslavia's independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and constitutional system. He stressed that no one is allowed to toy with Yugoslavia's fate.

	In late February, Albanian residents of Kosovo Autonomous Province held a general strike and boycott of classes, paralyzing the province's economic life and causing extreme tension in ethnic relations.

	On February 27, the Yugoslav Federal Presidency decided to take special measures in the province.

	General Silic said that the recent events in Kosovo were instigated by nationalist and separatist forces. The Federal Presidency's decision to take special measures is aimed at stopping hostile activities and reversing the situation. The People's Army troops in Kosovo are on high alert and ready to carry out various tasks assigned by the Federal Presidency.

	Regarding the recent appearance of many tanks in Kosovo, Silic said that the People's Army has no need to hide the state of alert and exercises of its troops. This is an encouragement to the Yugoslav people and a warning to those with ulterior motives.

	Silic emphasized that the current main task is to resolutely implement the special measures of the Federal Presidency and to eliminate all factors threatening the state's constitutional system, the safety of citizens' lives and property. From a long-term perspective, the key to resolving the Kosovo crisis is to strengthen mutual trust and brotherly unity among the peoples of different nationalities.

　　南斯拉夫人民军将领强调指出
    不许任何人拿国家命运当儿戏
    驻科索沃部队正处于高度戒备
    新华社贝尔格莱德３月４日电  南斯拉夫人民军普里什蒂纳驻军司令西利奇少将今天向南新闻媒介发表谈话时强调指出，南斯拉夫人民军坚决保卫南斯拉夫的独立、主权、领土完整和宪法制度，决不允许任何人拿南斯拉夫的命运当儿戏。
    ２月下旬，科索沃自治省阿尔巴尼亚族人举行了总罢工和总罢课，使该省经济生活陷于瘫痪、民族关系极度紧张。
    ２月２７日，南斯拉夫联邦主席团决定对该省采取特别措施。
    西利奇少将说，科索沃最近发生的事件是民族主义和分离主义势力煽动的，联邦主席团决定采取特别措施是为了制止敌对活动和扭转局势。在科索沃的人民军部队正处于高度战备状态，准备执行联邦主席团下达的各种任务。
    在谈到科索沃最近出现许多坦克问题时，西利奇说，南人民军没有必要隐瞒部队的戒备状态和演习，这对南斯拉夫人民是一种鼓舞，对别有用心的人则是一种警告。
    西利奇强调指出，目前的主要任务是坚决贯彻执行联邦主席团的特别措施，全力消除威胁国家宪法制度、公民人身和财产安全的各种危险因素。从长远观点来看，要解决科索沃危机，最重要的是加强各民族人民间的相互信任和兄弟团结。
