The first round of France's six-year municipal elections concluded yesterday. According to figures released by the Ministry of the Interior early this morning, the left-wing parties garnered 42%, the right-wing parties 47.49%, and other parties 7.73%. This distribution is roughly similar to the 1983 municipal elections. However, the abstention rate was nearly 30%, the highest in any post-war municipal election.

Yesterday, the reporter visited a polling station in the 17th arrondissement of Paris. Each voter selects one of five ballots placed on the table. Each ballot lists 39 candidates, nominated by one or more parties. The staff explained that voters are essentially choosing a party.

This election will determine over 36,000 municipal councilors nationwide, who will then elect the mayors. Based on the results from various districts in Paris, Chirac is set to become the mayor of Paris for the third time, following his victories in 1977 and 1983. More than a quarter of the candidates, who did not secure half of the votes, will face off in the second round of voting next week.

　　法国市镇选举第一轮投票结束
    希拉克将蝉联巴黎市长
    本报巴黎３月１３日电  记者张启华报道：法国６年一选的市镇选举昨天进行第一轮投票。据今天凌晨内政部公布的数字，左派占４２％，右派占４７．４９％，其它党派占７．７３％，同１９８３年市镇选举时的各政治力量配置基本相近。但弃权率近３０％，为战后几次市镇选举中最高的一次。
    昨天，记者参观了巴黎市第十七区的一个选举站。每个选民从桌上摆着的５张选票上任选一张。每张选票上的３９名候选人，是由一个或几个党派推选出来的。工作人员说，选民实质上只是选举党派。
    这次选举全国要产生３．６万多个市镇的市政委员，进而推选出市长。从巴黎各区选举结果看，希拉克将继１９７７年、１９８３年之后、第三次出任巴黎市市长。尚有１／４多的候选人因选票不够半数，将在下周举行的第二轮投票时决出。
