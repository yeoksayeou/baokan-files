	Jaruzelski emphasized that in the new situation, we demand that the primary party organizations in factories change their methods and style of work, but "we will not allow them to be driven out of the factories."

	Jaruzelski made these remarks on the 11th during a meeting with the first secretaries of the primary party organizations in Warsaw province and Warsaw city. The Polish News Agency broadcast his speech this evening.

	Jaruzelski said that profound changes are currently taking place in Poland, and some outdated practices must be changed, but the party "will not, and will never change its advanced ideas."

	Regarding the ongoing "Round Table Talks," Jaruzelski pointed out that the "Round Table Talks" present a "good opportunity" for the country. He said that it is neither a gift we are giving to the opposition nor a gift the opposition is giving to us. He urged people not to evaluate the "Round Table Talks" using the "principle of buying and selling" or the "standard of gains and losses."

	On the issue of the authorities' dialogue with the Solidarity Trade Union and other constructive opposition forces, he said that there are "risks" involved in this, but as the proverb goes, "if you are afraid of the wolf, don't go into the forest." He explained that the "high sense of responsibility" for Poland's tomorrow and the day after tomorrow drives the authorities to take this risk.

　　雅鲁泽尔斯基强调
    必须正确评价圆桌会议
    新华社华沙３月１２日电  （记者汤德乔）波兰统一工人党中央第一书记雅鲁泽尔斯基强调说，在新的形势下，我们要求工厂的基层党组织改变工作方法和作风，但“决不允许把它们从工厂中排挤出去”。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基是１１日在与华沙省和华沙市基层党组织第一书记会见时作上述表示的。波通社今晚播发了他的讲话。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基说，目前在波兰正进行着深刻的变革，一些过了时的做法必须加以改变，但是，党“不会，也永远不会改变自己的先进思想”。
    在谈到正在举行的“圆桌会议”时，雅鲁泽尔斯基指出，“圆桌会议”对国家是一次“良好的机会”，它既不是我们给反对派的礼物，也不是反对派给我们的礼物。他要求人们不要用“买卖原则”或“得失标准”来评价“圆桌会议”。
    关于当局同团结工会等建设性反对派的对话问题，他说，在这个问题上是“会有风险的”，但正如谚语所说，“如果害怕狼，就不要进森林”。他解释说，“对波兰国家的明天和后天的高度责任感”驱使当局冒这一风险。
