In recent years, some conscripted soldiers have shown high enthusiasm for learning civilian technologies but are reluctant to learn military technologies. At the beginning of last year, a certain regiment conducted a questionnaire survey of 100 new soldiers. In the "Why enlist?" section, 68 people wrote "to learn a civilian technology," while only 9 answered "to defend the motherland and resist aggression." Many young people, upon arriving at the unit, immediately request to learn vehicle driving, repair, and other technologies. Some, after being assigned as ordinary soldiers, still frequently request to change their roles to learn technologies.

Currently, the difficulty of recruitment has increased. Some local leaders, in order to complete their tasks, often exaggerate the propaganda that serving in the military can provide the opportunity to learn technologies. This has led a portion of young people to enlist with incorrect motives, causing some problems for the unit's work. The number of technical military positions is limited, and the majority of soldiers' wishes to learn civilian technologies cannot be realized. Consequently, some soldiers become disgruntled, some desert and return home, and some lack initiative in their work, merely marking time until they can be discharged, causing difficulties in the unit's construction and management.

It is suggested that relevant local departments conduct national defense education among eligible youth, rectify their motives for enlistment, and improve the quality of recruits.

### 加强征兵教育工作  端正青年入伍动机

　　加强征兵教育工作  端正青年入伍动机
    近几年来，部分服役战士学习民用技术的积极性很高，却不愿学习军事技术。去年初，某团对１００名新战士作问卷调查，在“为什么当兵？”一栏里，有６８人填写的是“为学一门民用技术”，只有９人答的是“为了保卫祖国，抵御侵略”。许多青年一到部队就要求学习车辆驾驶、修理等技术；有的已分配当了普通兵，仍经常要求改行学技术。
    现在，征兵难度相对增大，有的地方领导人为完成任务，往往言过其实地宣传到部队服役可以学到技术，致使一部分青年带着不正确的动机来到部队，这就给部队工作带来一些问题。部队的技术兵种数量少，多数战士要求学民用技术的愿望不可能实现。为此，有的战士闹情绪，有的擅自离队回乡，有的在工作中不求上进，熬年头，混日子，等着退伍，造成了部队建设和管理上的困难。
    建议地方有关部门在适龄青年中进行国防观念教育，端正入伍动机，提高兵员质量。
