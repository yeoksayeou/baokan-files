Over the past year, the factories in our area that produce compound feed for pigs have successively closed down. Pig farmers, unable to purchase compound feed, have been forced to slaughter their sows. Feeding piglets with compound feed allows them to be weaned and sold a month earlier compared to those fed with ordinary feed, and it also saves about twenty-five kilograms of grain per piglet. We hope that the relevant departments will quickly resume the production of compound feed to contribute to the stabilization of pig production.

　　尽快恢复复合饲料生产
    去年以来，我们这里生产供养猪用的复合饲料的厂家相继关闭。养猪户因买不到复合饲料便宰杀母猪。用复合饲料喂养仔猪比一般饲料喂养的仔猪早出圈一个多月，每头仔猪还可节约粮食二十五公斤。希望有关部门尽快恢复复合饲料的生产，为稳定生猪生产作出贡献。
