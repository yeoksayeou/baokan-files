The President of the Afghan Seven-Party Alliance "Provisional Government" Calls for the Dissolution of the Kabul Regime

	New Delhi, March 9 (Xinhua) - Afghan Seven-Party Alliance Provisional Government President Mujaddidi said yesterday that the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan was the result of great sacrifices and arduous struggles by the Afghan people.

	Mujaddidi made his first nationwide address to Afghanistan through the "Voice of Afghanistan" radio station based in Peshawar yesterday.

	The Soviet Union, in accordance with the Geneva Accords brokered by the United Nations, withdrew all its troops from Afghanistan on February 15 this year. The Seven-Party Alliance did not participate in the negotiations on the Geneva Accords and did not sign the agreement.

	Mujaddidi was elected as the President of the Provisional Government last month at the Afghan Consultative Conference held in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The Afghan Eight-Party Alliance based in Iran did not participate in this consultative conference.

	Mujaddidi said that the Provisional Government's primary task is to "completely dissolve the puppet regime in Kabul," restore peace throughout the country, prepare for the safe and dignified return of Afghan refugees, and hold free and fair elections as soon as possible to enable the Afghan people to exercise their right to participate in politics.

	When discussing the diplomatic principles of the Provisional Government, he said that the Provisional Government will deepen friendly relations with Islamic countries such as Pakistan that have previously assisted the Afghan Mujahideen in their struggle, and establish mutual understanding with other countries in the world based on Islamic principles.

　　阿七党联盟“临时政府”总统
    要求解散喀布尔政权
    新华社伊斯兰堡３月９日电  阿富汗７党联盟临时政府总统穆贾迪迪昨天说，苏联从阿富汗撤军是阿富汗人民做出巨大牺牲和艰苦奋斗的结果。
    穆贾迪迪是昨天通过设在白沙瓦的《阿富汗之声》电台向阿富汗全国首次发表讲话的。
    苏联是根据在联合国斡旋下达成的日内瓦协议于今年２月１５日把军队全部撤出阿富汗的。７党联盟没有参加关于日内瓦协议的谈判，也没有在协议上签字。
    穆贾迪迪是上个月在巴基斯坦拉瓦尔品第举行的阿富汗协商会议上当选为临时政府总统的。设在伊朗的阿富汗８党联盟没有参加这次协商会议。
    穆贾迪迪说，临时政府的首要任务是“完全解散喀布尔傀儡政权”，在全国恢复和平，为阿富汗难民安全和体面地返回家园做准备，以及尽快举行自由和公正的选举，以便能使阿富汗人民行使他们的参政权。
    在谈到临时政府的外交政策原则时他说，临时政府将同过去曾经帮助过阿富汗游击队斗争的巴基斯坦等伊斯兰国家加深友好关系，并根据伊斯兰教义同世界上其他国家建立相互谅解的关系。
