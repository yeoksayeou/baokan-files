Walking into the Gold Star Coffee Shop on Lenin Bend, we were immediately struck by the warm ambiance. Soft music played gently, and under the soft lighting, groups of customers sat around small round tables, sipping coffee, enjoying pastries, or tapping their fingers to the music. A young and beautiful waitress moved gracefully among them, attending to everyone's needs.

The Gold Star Coffee Shop was originally a small store run by the Budapest City Hotel and Catering Service Company, staffed by seven people. Sixteen years ago, Ferenczi, who had graduated from a catering school, started working here. However, the shop had been poorly managed for a long time, even incurring losses. In 1982, Hungary held its first public auction for individual leasing. With her husband Sank's encouragement, Ferenczi won the bid with an annual lease payment of 790,000 forints, securing a five-year lease.

After becoming the manager of Hungary's first individually leased store, Ferenczi undertook a comprehensive reform and reorganization of the shop. Using her own savings and a portion of the company's loan, she renovated the shop and added new equipment such as televisions and audio systems.

To attract customers, she focused on improving service quality. She mandated that all staff greet customers with smiles and provide immediate service upon their arrival. She ensured the quality and quantity of food and beverages, and imposed penalties, including wage deductions and dismissal, for any negligence. Over the past few years, 25 employees were dismissed for such reasons. Conversely, better service led to higher wages; employees at the Gold Star Coffee Shop earned 20,000 forints per month, three times the national average. The pleasant environment and enthusiastic service attracted many customers, making the coffee shop increasingly prosperous.

Roughly calculated, the Gold Star Coffee Shop's revenue doubled in the first five years. After paying the lease to the company, its fixed assets increased by 30%, and its working capital expanded by 30% to 40%. Ferenczi also became wealthy. Due to the Gold Star Coffee Shop's strict adherence to price and quality regulations and its civilized management, it passed nearly 100 inspections by district, city, trade unions, and commercial management departments, earning the title of "Excellent Enterprise." Ferenczi was frequently praised as an outstanding female manager. During the second auction when the first lease period ended, she outbid four competitors with an annual lease payment of 2.34 million forints, securing the lease again.

When asked by the reporter about the impact of last year's tax reform and price increases on the coffee shop's operations, Ferenczi said that these changes indeed brought many challenges. However, she did not retreat in the face of difficulties but decided to improve her management methods further, increase revenue, and contribute more to the state.

To overcome the difficulties, she adopted a strategy of low profit and high volume, avoiding passing on the full burden of price increases to customers. Although the authorities allowed a 20% price increase for beverages, she only raised prices by 15%. She also increased the variety of products and services to attract more customers. Additionally, she extended the operating hours from 7 AM to 3 AM, totaling 20 hours a day. She also streamlined staff and reduced expenses, often taking on the role of a waitress herself.

As we concluded our interview and walked out of the shop, we saw the owners of two other leased stores visiting to learn about her new management methods.

    热情服务  薄利多销
　　经营有方的女经理
    本报记者  严正
    跨进位于列宁弯路的金星咖啡馆，我们眼前蓦地一亮，仿佛进入了另一个天地。这里暖流扑面，乐曲轻扬，在柔和的灯光下，三五成群的顾客正围着一张张小圆桌，或喝着咖啡，或品尝糕点，或轻轻地打着节拍欣赏音乐。一位年轻美丽的女招待不停地穿行其间为大家服务。
    金星咖啡馆原是布达佩斯市区旅社及饮食服务公司的七人小店。十六年前从饮食服务专科学校毕业的费伦茨妮来到这个店里当工作人员。后来，商店长期经营不良，甚至出现亏损。一九八二年，匈牙利首次公开招标实行个人租赁。费伦茨妮在丈夫山克的鼓励下，以平均每年上交七十九万福林租赁费的条件中标，租赁的合同期为五年。
    费伦茨妮当上了匈牙利第一家个人租赁商店的经理后，就对商店进行了大刀阔斧的改革和整顿。她以自己积聚的资金和公司的部分贷款，将店面重新装潢一新，添置了彩电、音响等设备。
    要招徕顾客，必须狠抓服务质量。她规定每个店员都要笑脸迎人，只要顾客一入店，服务就送上前，特别要求确保饮料食品的数量和质量。店员如有疏忽，就要受到扣工资直至辞退的处罚。在过去的几年中，被辞退的店员有二十五人。相反，服务越好，则工资越高，金星咖啡馆职工的月工资达到二万福林，是社会上平均工资的三倍。优美的环境、热情周到的服务态度招徕了众多的顾客，咖啡馆的生意越做越兴隆。
    据粗略计算，在头五年内，金星咖啡馆的营业额翻了两番，除了给公司上交租赁费外，它的固定资产增加百分之三十，流动资金扩大百分之三十至四十，而费伦茨妮也富了起来。由于金星咖啡馆严守价格和质量规定，进行文明经营，经区、市、工会和工商管理处近百次的检查确认，获得了“优秀企业”的称号，而费伦茨妮也成为经常受到表扬的优秀女经理。在第一个合同期满商店第二次招标时，她又以每年上交租赁费二百三十四万福林的优势击败四个竞争者，再度中标。
    当记者问到去年税收改革和物价上涨对金星咖啡馆的营业有无影响时，费伦茨妮说，这确实带来了不少问题。但她在困难面前没有退缩，而是决心通过进一步改善经营方式，设法增加营业收入，向国家多交税、多作贡献。
    为了克服困难，她实行薄利多销，尽量不把价格上涨的负担都转嫁到顾客身上。上级允许饮料涨价百分之二十，她只涨百分之十五，她还增加商品品种和服务项目，以此吸引更多顾客。其次是延长营业时间，每天从早晨七点至深夜三点，整整营业二十个小时。另外还精简人员，节省开支，自己亲自顶班做招待工作。
    当我们结束采访走出店堂时，看到另外两个租赁商店的女主人来登门拜访，说是要向她请教最近采用的新的经营方法。
