	National People's Congress Standing Committee member and vice chairman of the Law Committee Gu Ming recently spoke at the Henan delegation meeting. He said that the socialist modernization we are undertaking is an unprecedentedly arduous and complex task. Without long-term exploration and practice, it is difficult to gain a deep understanding, and it is inevitable that there will be shortcomings and mistakes. He said that although today's shortcomings and mistakes have caused many difficulties, they are significantly different from past mistakes.

	He said, first of all, the nature is different. The "Great Leap Forward" committed serious mistakes in major policies. One was the rush for purity, confusing the two different historical stages of socialism and communism, and hastily trying to achieve communism; the other was the rush for results, blindly advancing, causing the country to suffer enormous losses. This time, the adjustment and rectification are based on the significant achievements of 10 years of reform, guided by the correct overall policies and guidelines formulated by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. The adjustment and rectification, deepening of the reform, slowing down the production speed, adjusting the economic structure and industrial policies, and rectifying economic relations aim to promote reform and achieve healthy economic development in a stable manner.

	Secondly, the domestic and international environment and situation are different. He said, during the "Great Leap Forward" and the "Cultural Revolution," China was surrounded and economically blockaded by various hostile forces internationally, facing great difficulties. Now, the international situation has shifted from confrontation to dialogue, and developing the economy, conducting trade and technological cooperation and exchanges have become new historical trends. The international environment is favorable for us to carry out adjustment and rectification and deepen the reform.

	Gu Ming believes that the price and time required for this adjustment are also different from the past. He said, the "Great Leap Forward," especially the "Cultural Revolution," lasted for several years and more than ten years, respectively. Today, after 10 years of reform, the benefits the Chinese people have gained far exceed any other historical period, which is a deep feeling for everyone. Currently, people are worried and dissatisfied with obvious inflation and excessive price increases. But as long as the entire Chinese people unite as one, spare no effort to carry out adjustment and rectification, and are determined to tighten our belts for a few years, the price we pay will not be as high as in the past, and the adjustment time will not be as long.

	Gu Ming, when talking about the difficulties of this adjustment and rectification, believes that first, the central government and local governments have divided powers, and local interests and overall interests cannot be completely consistent; second, various economic components and operating methods with public ownership as the mainstay have emerged, making coordination more difficult; third, the highly centralized economic system has been changed, increasing the difficulty of state regulation. But he believes that these difficulties can be overcome. As long as democracy is fully promoted, democratic decision-making is implemented, legal system construction is strengthened, and the enthusiasm of the people is fully mobilized, the adjustment and rectification will definitely proceed smoothly and achieve results.

　　人大代表顾明在发言中认为        
    改革缺点失误是前进中问题 
    与过去历次失误有很大不同
    新华社北京３月２６日电  全国人大常委会委员、法律委员会副主任委员顾明近日在河南代表团发言时说，我们进行的社会主义现代化建设是一项前所未有的极其艰巨复杂的事业，不经过长期的探索和实践难以有深刻的认识，产生缺点和失误也是难免的。他说，今天的缺点和失误虽然造成了很多困难，但与过去历次失误比有很大不同。
    他说，首先是性质不同。“大跃进”时犯的是重大方针、政策错误。一是急于求纯，混淆了社会主义和共产主义两个不同的历史阶段，急急忙忙想实现共产主义；二是急于求成，盲目冒进，使国家遭受巨大损失。这次治理整顿是在１０年改革取得巨大成就的基础上，贯彻执行党的十三大制定的正确的总方针、总政策指导下进行的。治理整顿，深化改革，放慢生产速度，调整经济结构和产业政策，理顺经济关系，目的是为了在稳定中推进改革和求得经济的健康发展。
    其次是国内外环境和形势不同。他说，“大跃进”和“文化大革命”时，我国正处在国际各种敌对势力的包围和经济封锁之中，处境十分困难。如今，国际形势由对抗转向对话，发展经济，开展贸易和技术合作交流，已成为新的历史潮流。国际环境对我们搞治理整顿深化改革有利。
    顾明认为，这次调整要付出的代价和需要的时间与过去比也不同。他说，“大跃进”，特别是“文化大革命”，分别延续了好几年和十多年。今天，我国人民经历１０年改革，得到的实惠已超过过去任何历史时期，这是每个人都有深刻体会的。当前，人民对明显的通货膨胀和物价上涨幅度过大，是担忧和不满的。但只要全国人民团结一心，全力以赴治理整顿，下决心过几年紧日子，付出的代价绝不会像过去那么大，调整的时间也不会那样长。
    顾明在谈到这次治理整顿的困难条件时认为，一是中央与地方分权，局部利益与全局利益不可能完全一致；二是出现了以公有制为主体的多种经济成份和多种经营方式，协调比较困难；三是改变了高度集中的经济体制，国家调控的难度增加。但他认为，这些困难都是可以克服的。只要充分发扬民主，实行民主决策，加强法制建设，充分调动人民群众的积极性，治理整顿一定能顺利进行并取得成效。
