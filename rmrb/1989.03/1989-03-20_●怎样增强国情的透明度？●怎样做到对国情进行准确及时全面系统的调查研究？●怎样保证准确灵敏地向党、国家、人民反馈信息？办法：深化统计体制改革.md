Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's statistical work has undergone profound changes and has become increasingly important in the construction of socialist modernization. Accordingly, the transparency of national conditions has improved compared to the past. However, there are still many factors constraining and hindering the enhancement of national conditions' transparency. This is mainly due to the existing statistical system having many flaws, such as weak supervision, insufficient coordination power, low overall efficiency, slow system construction, and backward information technology. These situations indicate that accelerating and deepening statistical system reform is urgent.

Statistical system reform is a complex systematic project involving many aspects. The strategic goal of statistical system reform should be: to fundamentally reform the organizational leadership of the national statistical system. Emphasize strengthening the national statistical leadership organization, establish and improve a vertical and independent national statistical system, establish a scientific division of labor between national statistics and departmental statistics, accelerate the modernization and legalization of statistics, make the new statistical system meet the requirements of developing a socialist commodity economy and building socialist democratic politics for statistical information, meet the requirements of independent and objective statistical supervision and statistical consultation for the Party, the state, and the people, and meet the requirements of national modernization and the perfection of socialist legal system. To achieve this strategic goal, the following five aspects need to be studied and resolved in the near term.

(1) Strengthen the national statistical leadership organization. The biggest weakness of the current statistical system is that national statistical work lacks a strong organization, especially the State Statistical Bureau, the "overall leadership" organization, is weak and cannot command national statistical work and national economic accounting work. Given that national statistical activities involve the fields of politics, economy, science and technology, and culture, they need to be carried out under the unified policy, unified plan, and unified scientific methodology guidance of the state; given that the guiding role of statistical information has a wide impact on the activities of all aspects of society, involving the interests of all sectors of society, and its comprehensiveness and impact are strong, it is necessary to establish an authoritative statistical leadership organization that can command the national statistical cause. Based on China's and the world's statistical practice experience, it can be considered to establish a State Statistical Commission, which will unify the leadership, management, coordination, and supervision of national statistical work and national economic accounting work, unify the socialist accounting (including statistical, accounting, and business accounting) and national statistical system, methods, and standards; directly organize and lead major national condition censuses or surveys; concentrate the social, economic, and scientific and technological statistical information of various departments, regions, and units, share information, and implement information sharing; implement open, independent statistical supervision and statistical consultation. The affiliation of the State Statistical Commission can have two models: one is directly affiliated with the State Council as part of the state administrative organization, which is beneficial to state administrative management; the other is directly affiliated with the National People's Congress as a special committee of the state power organization, which is beneficial to the supervision of the state power organization over the state administrative organization.

(2) Establish and improve a vertical and independent national statistical system, and strengthen the construction of urban and rural statistical information networks. In 1962, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council formulated the "Decision on Strengthening Statistical Work," which stipulated: the business work of statistical organs at all levels is subject to the vertical leadership of the State Statistical Bureau, and the party work and administrative work are subject to the leadership of local party and government. The establishment, personnel, and funds of statistical organs at all levels are managed uniformly (referred to as "one vertical and three unifications"). This "Decision" summarizes the experience and lessons of China's statistical work and is made to meet the needs of the Party and the state to achieve "accurate figures and clear situations." The essence of "one vertical and three unifications" is to ensure the accuracy of statistical information and the independence of statistical supervision from the organizational system. This principle should be continued.

Practice has proven that statistical supervision must be independent, which is the soul of statistical supervision. Management science has a basic principle: the supervisory organization should not be a subordinate organization of the supervised organization. Otherwise, supervision will be ineffective. For a long time, the reason why China's statistical supervision has been weak and powerless, and some cadres who insist on seeking truth from facts and insist on statistical supervision have been repeatedly attacked and persecuted, is due to two aspects. One is the institutional cause: the statistical organization is affiliated with the administrative organization at all levels, making it easy to rely on and be controlled by the "official will" of local party and government leaders, and it is difficult to independently exercise statistical powers. The second is the legal cause: the statistical regulations stipulate that statistical organs at all levels are the organs that implement and supervise the implementation of statistical regulations, but they have not clearly stipulated the specific law enforcement powers and penalty powers. Due to the lack of guaranteed work and safety for statistical personnel, it is difficult to carry out statistical supervision, which leads to a large amount of true national conditions and public opinion being difficult to report upwards. When reporting achievements, there is a lot of exaggeration and water, and when reporting shortcomings, there is concealment and cover-up of the truth, or acting according to the leader's eyes, and the figures float with the "wind."

To solve this problem, we should follow the basic direction of "one vertical and three unifications" and further explore the phased and gradual implementation path. At present, we can first consolidate and improve the work of the national statistical leadership organization to unify the management of the establishment and business funds of the national statistical system, and the local government can solve the manpower, financial, and material resources needed for local statistical surveys through multiple channels and levels. On the basis of consolidating the first phase of work, the national statistical system should gradually extend to the township level, explore the path of unified management by the provincial statistical organization of the establishment, personnel, and funds (including business funds, administrative funds, and construction funds) of the municipal statistical organization, by the municipal statistical organization of the county statistical organization, and by the county statistical organization of the township statistical personnel or organization in a tiered and unified manner. The key here is to scientifically solve the problems of national funds and personnel management.

(3) Scientific division of labor and close cooperation between national statistics and departmental statistics. From the overall pattern of the national statistical system, on the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen the national statistical leadership organization and the national statistical system, on the other hand, due to the complexity of national conditions and the diversity of information needs, it is determined that China's statistical work cannot and does not need to be highly concentrated in the national statistical system. The national statistical organ, as the center of national statistics and national economic accounting, has a heavy task. For the professional, technical, and temporary statistical surveys, statistical analysis, statistical forecasting, and statistical supervision tasks required by various management departments, they should be undertaken by the respective competent departments. This approach is more conducive to giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the statistical work of various departments and is more conducive to the development and prosperity of the national statistical cause. China's statistical system implements the "grid" combination, with the "grid" as the mainstay, which meets the needs of the state to gradually transform the management of enterprises to indirect management, develop horizontal economic ties, and implement the new economic operation mechanism of "state regulation of the market, market guidance of enterprises." It can be predicted that the statistical organs at all levels of the national statistical system will develop faster than the departmental statistical organs. In the organizational reform, the basic, public, comprehensive, and regular statistical functions within the scope of national statistics and local statistics should be decomposed and transferred to the national statistical organs to undertake; the professional, special, and temporary statistical functions within the scope of departmental statistics should be undertaken by the respective professional management departments. This approach is conducive to the statistical organs at all levels investigating, providing, analyzing, and forecasting statistical information covering the entire society, including various types and departments, ensuring that the Party, the state, and the people grasp the most basic and regular national condition information, preventing repeated investigations and multiple outputs, and can give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the various competent departments, ensuring the professional management needs of the various management departments. The key here is how to implement the scientific division of labor and mutual connection between national statistics and departmental statistics.

(4) Accelerate the construction of the national statistical information automation system. At present, the demand for statistical information in the whole society is increasing dramatically. To change the backward situation of statistics, it is necessary to invest a certain amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources to prioritize the automation of the national statistical information system. To accomplish this task, first, this system construction task should be formally included in the national long-term plan and annual plan to ensure implementation; second, based on the principles of organizational reform, simplification, unification, and efficiency, from the scientific and overall nature of organizational configuration, the national statistical information automation system and the national economic information system, these two macroeconomic information systems, should be merged and managed uniformly by the national and local statistical commissions at all levels. It is understood that the government information systems of many countries in the world are mostly led and managed by the national statistical organs. This approach is conducive to reflecting the requirements of modern information technology management integration, can save the repeated construction costs of the two macroeconomic information systems, strengthen the development, management, and utilization of social and economic information resources, and make national statistics and national economic accounting faster to the track of using modern information technology.

(5) Improve the construction of statistical legal system. Countries with good statistical work in the world all implement the rule of law, and statistical organs and statistical personnel are only responsible for numbers, facts, and laws. An important malpractice in China's statistical work is personal rule, and the good or bad of statistical construction depends on whether the leader pays attention to it or not. The feedback of statistical information is subject to the "official will." To fundamentally ensure the modernization and legalization of the statistical cause, it is necessary to move from personal rule to the rule of law and implement statistics according to law. We should continuously improve the statistical legal system. At present, it is necessary to strengthen the statistical legislation of local and departmental levels, and it is necessary to grant the national statistical organs the necessary and specific law enforcement powers and penalty powers for statistical violations. It is necessary to set up statistical inspection organs and statistical inspectors, strengthen statistical legal supervision; establish a system of announcements and reports on statistical violations and law enforcement, make the national statistical organs the reporting center for national statistical supervision, and gradually implement the openness of statistical and legal supervision.

    办法：深化统计体制改革
    黄海
    党的十一届三中全会以来，我国统计工作面貌发生了深刻的变化，在社会主义现代化建设中日益显示出重要的作用。与此相适应，国情透明度较以前有了提高。但当前还有许多因素制约和妨碍着国情透明度的增强，这主要是现行统计体制还存在着许多弊端，诸如监督软弱无力，协调权力过弱，整体效益不高，系统建设缓慢，信息技术落后等。这些情况都说明，加快和深化统计体制改革十分迫切。
    统计体制改革是个复杂的系统工程，涉及到许多方面的问题。统计体制改革的战略目标应当是：从根本上改革全国统计系统的组织领导。着重强化国家统计领导机构，建立健全垂直独立的国家统计系统，确立国家统计与部门统计的科学分工，加快统计现代化、法制化建设，使新的统计体制符合发展社会主义商品经济、建设社会主义民主政治对统计信息的要求，符合为党、国家、人民实行独立的、客观的统计监督和统计咨询的要求，符合国家现代化和完善社会主义法制的要求。为了实现这个战略目标，近期要着重研究解决以下五个方面的问题。
    （一）强化国家统计领导机构。现行统计体制最大的薄弱环节，在于全国统计工作没有坚强的组织，特别是国家统计局这个“总的领导”机构软弱无力，难以统帅全国统计工作和国民经济核算工作。鉴于全国统计活动涉及政治、经济、科技、文化各个领域，需要在国家统一政策、统一计划、统一的科学方法论指导下进行；鉴于统计信息的导向作用对社会各个方面的活动有广泛影响，触及社会各界的利益关系，其综合性很强，影响很大，因此，建立一个有权威的、能够统帅全国统计事业的统计领导机构，极为必要。根据我国和世界统计的实践经验，可以考虑设立国家统计委员会，由它统一领导、管理、协调、监督全国统计工作和国民经济核算工作，把社会主义核算（包括统计、会计、业务三种核算）和国家统计制度、方法、标准统一管起来；直接组织领导重大的国情普查或调查；把各部门、地区、单位的社会、经济、科技统计信息集中起来，互通情报，实行信息共享；实行公开性的、独立的统计监督和统计咨询。国家统计委员会的隶属关系，可有两种模式：一是直属国务院，作为国家行政机构的组成部分，这样有利于国家行政管理；二是直属全国人民代表大会，作为国家权力机构的一个专门委员会，这样有利于国家权力机关对国家行政机关的监督。
    （二）建立健全垂直独立的国家统计系统，加强城市和农村统计信息网络建设。１９６２年，党中央和国务院制订的《加强统计工作的决定》规定：各级国家统计机构在业务工作方面受国家统计局垂直领导，在党的工作和行政工作方面受当地党和政府领导。各级国家统计机构的编制、干部、经费实行统一管理（简称“一垂三统”）。这个《决定》总结了我国统计工作的经验与教训，是针对统计工作中存在的主要问题以及党和国家要求做到“数字准、情况明”的需要作出的。“一垂三统”的实质，就是从组织体制上保障统计信息的准确性、统计监督的独立性。这个《决定》的原则精神，我认为有必要继续贯彻。
    实践证明，统计监督必须独立，这是统计监督的灵魂。管理科学有一条基本原理：监督机构不宜作为被监督机构隶属的下级机构。否则，监督就会失灵。长期以来，我国统计监督之所以软弱无力，一些坚持实事求是原则，坚持统计监督的干部屡遭打击迫害，这有两个方面的原因。一是体制上的原因：统计机构隶属于各级行政机构，容易依附和受制于当地党政领导的“长官意志”，难以独立行使统计职权。二是法制上的原因：统计法规规定各级国家统计机关是国家贯彻并监督执行统计法规的机关，但尚未明确规定具体的执法权、制裁权。由于统计人员的工作和安全没有确实保障，实行统计监督难上加难，从而导致大量真实的国情、民意难以上达。讲成绩时虚报、水分不少，讲缺点时瞒报、掩盖真象，或者看领导眼色行事，数字随“风”飘荡。
    解决这个问题，应当按照“一垂三统”的基本方向，进一步探索分阶段逐步实施的途径。眼下，可首先巩固和完善由国家统计领导机关统一管理国家统计系统的编制和事业费的工作，地方政府多渠道、多层次解决地方统计调查所需人力、财力、物力。在巩固第一阶段工作的基础上，国家统计系统应当逐步延伸到乡一级，探索在编制、干部、经费（包括事业费、行政费、基建费）上由省统计机构统一管理地（市）统计机构，由地（市）统计机构统一管理县统计机构，由县统计机构统一管理乡镇专职统计员或机构的分层次统一管理的途径。这里的关键是科学地解决国家经费和干部管理问题。
    （三）国家统计与部门统计科学分工、密切协作。从全国统计体制的总格局来讲，一方面要强化国家统计领导机构和强化国家统计系统，另一方面由于国情的复杂性和信息需求的多样性，决定了我国统计工作不可能也不必要高度集中到国家统计系统来做。国家统计机关作为国家统计和国民经济核算的中心，任务很重。对于为各个管理部门所必需的专业性、技术性、临时性的统计调查、统计分析、统计预测、统计监督任务，则应由各主管部门负责。这样做更有利于发挥各部门统计工作的积极性和创造性，更有利于全国统计事业的发展、繁荣。我国统计体制实行“条块”结合，以“块”为主，符合国家对企业逐步转向以间接管理为主，发展横向经济联系，实行“国家调节市场，市场引导企业”的新经济运行机制的需要。可以预言，国家统计系统的各级统计机构必将比部门统计机构发展更快。在机构改革时，合并裁减的各专业管理部门的统计职能中，属于国家统计和地方统计调查范围内最基本的、公用的、综合性、经常性的统计职能，应当分解、转移到国家统计机关承担；属于部门统计范围内专业性、特殊性、临时性的统计职能，应当由各专业管理部门承担。这样做有利于各级国家统计机构调查、提供、分析、预测全社会范围，包括各种类型、各个部门的统计信息，保证党、国家、人民掌握最基本的、经常性的国情信息的需要，防止重复调查、数出多门，又可发挥各主管部门的积极性、创造性，保证各管理部门专业管理需要。这里的关键，是如何实行国家统计与部门统计科学分工与互相衔接。
    （四）加快国家统计信息自动化系统建设。现在，整个社会对统计信息的需要急剧增加，为了改变统计落后状况，要投入一定的人力、物力、财力，优先解决国家统计信息系统自动化问题。实现这个任务，一要把这个系统建设任务正式纳入国家的长远计划和年度计划，确保实施；二要根据机构改革精简、统一、效能的原则，从机构配置的科学性和整体性出发，将国家统计信息自动化系统和国家经济信息系统这两个宏观经济信息系统予以合并，由国家和地方各级统计委员会统一管理。据了解，世界许多国家的政府信息系统大都由国家统计机关统一领导和管理。这样做有利于体现现代信息技术管用结合的要求，可以节约两个宏观经济信息系统重复建设的花费，加强社会经济信息资源的开发、管理和利用，使国家统计和国民经济核算更快地转变到采用现代信息技术的轨道上来。
    （五）完善统计法制建设。世界上统计工作搞得好的国家都是实行法治，统计机构、统计人员只对数字、事实和法律负责。我国统计工作一个重要积弊是人治，统计建设的好坏以领导人重视与否为转移，统计信息的反馈受“长官意志”左右。为了从根本上确保统计事业的现代化、法制化，必须从人治走上法治，依法办统计。我们要不断使统计法制臻于完善。眼下，应当加强地方和部门的统计立法，应当明确授予国家统计机构对统计违法行为以必要的、具体的执法权、制裁权。应该设置统计检查机构和统计检查员，加强统计法律监督；建立统计违法、护法通告、通报制度，让国家统计机构成为国家统计监督的举报中心，逐步实行统计、法律监督公开化。
