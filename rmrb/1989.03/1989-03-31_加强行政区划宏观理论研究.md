With the deepening of economic and political system reforms and the development of commodity economy, administrative divisions, which are responsible for the comprehensive management of economy, politics, culture, and society, are facing many new situations. To address these issues, we must:

Strengthen Macroscopic Theoretical Research on Administrative Divisions

Administrative divisions are a comprehensive product of economic, political, and social factors. When dividing administrative regions, we must consider various factors, but in modern society, we must emphasize the function of serving the economy.

Administrative divisions refer to the division of administrative regions at various levels of the state. They play a crucial role in the state's political and economic activities and in the lives of the people, having a broad and profound impact on state administration, democratic political construction, national defense consolidation, economic development, and national unity. In the past, we emphasized the political and administrative aspects of administrative divisions, to some extent neglecting the economic factors and the role and influence of administrative divisions on economic development.

It is undeniable that the initial cause of administrative divisions was mainly the need for state rule, considered from a political perspective, with economic factors accounting for a very small proportion. For example, the feudal system of the Zhou Dynasty, the county system of Qin Shi Huang, and the province, prefecture, state, and county systems of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties were all primarily based on the need to consolidate the rule of the feudal emperors. However, with the development of productive forces, the economic factors in administrative divisions have become increasingly prominent. Therefore, the more modern the society, the more administrative region divisions consider the requirements of economic development. The late Qing Dynasty's establishment of provinces such as Taiwan and Xinjiang was both to consolidate border defenses and to develop the economy and culture of these places. The division of the 50 states in the United States largely reflects the economic and cultural characteristics of different regions. Although administrative region divisions are not the same as economic region divisions, after the basic political system is established, the main social functions of state power are to guide economic activities and promote the development of social productive forces. Administrative divisions influence and restrict economic systems and economic activity forms from multiple aspects such as political systems and administrative management systems. Administrative region divisions also affect the formation and development of regional economies, the development and use of resources, the rational layout of industry and cities, and so on. In adjusting economic structures and promoting the development of regional commodity economies, administrative divisions play a very important role.

Of course, at any time, we must clearly recognize that administrative divisions are not determined by a single factor but are a comprehensive product of economics, politics, and society. When dividing administrative regions, we must consider various factors, including politics, economics, culture, border defense, and ethnic relations. However, in modern society, administrative divisions must highlight the function and role of serving the economy, taking whether it is conducive to the development of productive forces and social progress as an important criterion for evaluating the rationality of administrative divisions.

To highlight the principle of administrative divisions serving the commodity economy, we must currently pay attention to handling the relationships between administrative divisions and economic divisions, administrative convenience and economic benefits, and implementing ethnic autonomy and developing ethnic regional economies.

Administrative divisions are state actions with distinct political characteristics, serving state rule and administration, and must reflect the will of the ruling class and embody the requirements of the ruling class's interests. However, administrative divisions are not arbitrary, but are constrained and governed by objective conditions such as natural geography, human geography, and economic structure, and have inherent laws and scientific principles to follow.

The general law of administrative region divisions is to adapt to the needs of economic and social development, taking economic, political, and social conditions as the fundamental basis for administrative region divisions. The basic principles of administrative region divisions are to be conducive to the people's democratic rights to manage state and social affairs, to be conducive to state administration, to be conducive to socialist construction, to be conducive to the unity of all ethnic groups, and to maintain relative stability. In the primary stage of socialism, administrative region divisions must, on the basis of adhering to the above basic principles, focus on the principle of serving the economy. Because the central task of the primary stage of socialism is to develop productive forces and develop the commodity economy. Administrative region divisions highlighting the principle of serving the commodity economy are both a concentrated embodiment of various basic principles of administrative divisions and an objective requirement of social development.

At the current stage, the principle of administrative divisions serving the commodity economy must handle three aspects of the relationship: (1) the relationship between administrative divisions and economic divisions, promoting the development of regional commodity economies; (2) the relationship between administrative convenience and economic benefits, using economic benefits as the fundamental criterion for measuring administrative management benefits; (3) the relationship between implementing ethnic autonomy, promoting ethnic unity, and developing ethnic regional economies, respecting ethnic customs, developing ethnic autonomy, and more importantly, developing the economies of ethnic minority regions and promoting the modernization of ethnic minority regional societies.

The determining factor for changes in administrative divisions is the productive forces. The development of productive forces leads to social changes, and with social changes, administrative divisions are adjusted. Generally, changes in administrative divisions occur during major historical turning points in the state's political and economic development, such as changes in state power, changes in economic systems or economic structures, etc. In China's history of over two thousand years, changes in administrative divisions mainly occurred in the early stages of the establishment of new dynasties and state powers, with strong political colors. However, currently, the fundamental reason and direct manifestation of changes in administrative divisions are the requirements of economic system reforms and the development of the commodity economy, the need to transform from a product economy model to a commodity economy model.

When changing administrative divisions, we must consider both reducing the actual levels of administrative divisions and appropriately adjusting the scope of some administrative divisions.

Levels and scope are two basic forms of administrative region divisions and are also two basic contents for regulating the structure of administrative divisions. According to the Constitution, China's administrative divisions are generally three levels: (1) the country is divided into provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government; (2) provinces and autonomous regions are divided into counties, autonomous counties, and cities; (3) counties are divided into townships, ethnic townships, and towns. In places where autonomous prefectures are established, the administrative divisions are four levels. However, in reality, there are generally regions or prefecture-level cities between provinces and counties, and some places have districts between counties and townships. The regions and districts are dispatch agencies of the provincial and county people's governments, but in reality, they have formed a level of administrative entities. Thus, China's actual administrative division levels are five or six levels.

Too many levels of administrative divisions affect management efficiency. The establishment of regional administrative offices and district offices has played a certain positive role in administrative management and economic construction in provinces (regions) with large populations or vast areas. However, in provinces (regions) with small populations or small areas, the establishment, form, scale, and role of regional administrative offices and district offices are worth studying. To reduce levels and improve efficiency, most provinces (regions) have successively abolished district offices. Liaoning and Jiangsu provinces have merged prefectures into cities, achieving good results. However, whether it is merging prefectures into cities or abolishing districts to establish townships, it has a significant impact, affecting the entire body, and must be thoroughly and fully researched and prepared theoretically, and carried out cautiously in steps.

Reducing the levels of administrative divisions is closely related to adjusting the scope of administrative divisions, and levels and scope are an indivisible whole. Currently, the sizes of administrative divisions at the same level in China are different. Some administrative regions are too large, making management inconvenient, command ineffective, and not conducive to economic development and the social activities of the people, and objectively creating many intermediate links. Therefore, to promote economic development and facilitate state administration, it is necessary to appropriately adjust the scope of some administrative divisions. However, due to historical reasons, how many levels China's administrative divisions should have, what size each level of administrative divisions should be, and what specific criteria there are for dividing levels and determining scope, currently lack scientific theoretical research.

The current "city-building fever" has brought many problems. The development of townships must be carried out actively and steadily. It must promote the development of industrialization while being conducive to agricultural development.

The primary stage of socialism is the stage of transition from an agricultural country to an industrial country. The development of the commodity economy and the realization of industrialization both need a base. The transformation process from an agricultural society to an industrial society is also the process of urbanization of rural society. Therefore, administrative divisions must adapt to and promote the development of the commodity economy and industrialization, actively develop township establishments, promote the coordinated development of urban and rural economies, and achieve common prosperity.

However, currently, there is a lack of macro planning and scientific layout in township establishment work, leading to a "city-building fever," which has, to a certain extent, played a role in pushing the national economy to overheat. The pace of changing counties into cities is too fast, impacting agricultural production, wasting a large amount of arable land, and increasing institutions and positions. The system of cities leading counties has, to a certain extent, promoted the coordinated development of urban and rural economies. However, some cities have weak economic radiation capabilities and lack scientific methods for cities leading counties, forming "city-managed counties," with excessive administrative interference from cities to counties, increasing administrative levels, and having a certain restraining and blocking effect on the economic development and horizontal cooperation of counties. Some county-level cities are trying every means to upgrade to prefecture-level cities and request to lead counties. The upgrading of a county-level city generally requires an investment of 500 million yuan, occupies 5,000 mu of land, and cannot be stable for 5 years, which is not conducive to economic construction in terms of personnel, finance, and materials. Although a planned single-list city is not a first-level administrative division, it involves the relationship between provinces and cities and the relationship between cities and counties, impacting the old provincial-city system. The planned single-list city system has promoted the development of regional economies but has also brought many problems that need to be discussed theoretically.

The fundamental purpose of developing township establishments is to promote the development of industrialization. Therefore, the development of township establishments must be carried out actively and steadily, scientifically handling the relationships between cities and rural areas and between industry and agriculture, promoting the development of industrialization while being conducive to agricultural production. This requires scientific planning, overall layout, and the establishment of a scientific and reasonable county-city-township structure system. In 1980, the State Council proposed the policy of developing cities as "controlling the scale of large cities, reasonably developing medium-sized cities, and actively developing small cities." The practice of the past 8 years has proven that this policy is correct. In the future, the development of township establishments should continue to adhere to this policy, actively and steadily developing medium and small cities.

Changing counties into cities and cities leading counties are two fundamental paths for developing city systems. Changing counties into cities should adhere to the direction of urban-rural integration, abandon the model of block-building cities, and especially pay attention to the coordinated development of industry and agriculture. Merging prefectures into cities and cities leading counties should reform the administrative model of cities managing counties, highlight the function and role of "leading," form a regional economy with the city as the center, and gradually transition to a system where both cities and counties are directly under the leadership of the province in terms of administration, reducing administrative interference from cities to counties.

Implementing township systems and townships leading villages is an inevitable path for rural society to develop towards industrialization and urbanization. Small towns are close to rural areas and have many functions such as adjusting urban-rural relationships and developing urban-rural commodity economies. The development of township systems should focus on serving rural commodity economies, promoting the development of production-type township systems, and reducing consumption-type township systems as much as possible. At the same time, we should actively guide the development of regional economies in small townships and villages, try to establish township management areas, and strengthen township management.

　　加强行政区划宏观理论研究
    随着经济政治体制改革的深化和商品经济的发展，作为经济、政治、文化、社会等多方面综合管理的行政区划面临着许多新的情况，解决这些问题，就要——

    　　虑多方面的因素，但在现代社会，更要突出为经济服务的功能。
    行政区划即国家各级行政区域的划分，它在国家政治经济活动和人民生活中占有十分重要的地位，对国家行政管理、民主政治建设、国防巩固、经济的发展及民族团结，有着广泛而深刻的影响。过去我们对行政区划的政治性和行政性强调得比较多，在一定程度上忽视了行政区划中的经济因素和行政区划对经济发展的作用和影响。
    无可否认，行政区划的最初起因主要是国家统治的需要，是从政治方面考虑的，经济的因素只占极少的份量。如周朝的分封制、秦始皇的郡县制及元、明、清的省、府、州、县制等，都主要是从巩固封建帝王统治的需要出发的。但是，随着生产力的发展，行政区划中经济的因素越来越突出。因此，越到现代社会，行政区域划分就越来越较多地考虑经济发展的要求。清朝后期增设台湾、新疆等省，就既是为巩固边防，也是为了开发这些地方的经济文化。美国５０个州的划分，在很大程度上反映了不同地区的经济文化特色。行政区域划分虽然不等于经济区域划分，但在基本政治制度确立以后，国家政权的主要社会职能是指导经济活动，促进社会生产力的发展，行政区划从政治体制和行政管理体制等多方面影响和制约着经济体制和经济活动形式。行政区域划分还影响着区域经济的形成和发展，影响着资源的开发、国土的管理使用、工业及城市的合理布局。在调整经济结构，促进区域商品经济的发育和发展等方面，行政区划更有着非常重要的意义。
    当然，任何时候我们也都应清楚认识到，行政区划不只是由某种单一因素决定的，而是经济、政治和社会的综合产物。在划分行政区域时，必须考虑多方面的因素，包括政治、经济、文化、边防及民族关系等等。但在现代社会，行政区划必须突出为经济服务的功能和作用，把是否有利于生产力的发展和社会的进步作为检验行政区划是否合理的重要标准。
    　　　　为了突出行政区划为商品经济服务的原则，当前要注意处理好行政区划与经济区划、方便行政管理与提高经济效益、实行民族自治与发展民族区域经济的关系。
    行政区划是国家的行为，带有鲜明的政治色彩，是为国家统治和行政管理服务的，必然要反映统治阶级意志，体现统治阶级利益的要求。但是，行政区划并不是任人涂抹的纸墨，而是受自然地理、人文地理及经济结构等客观条件制约和支配的，有其内在规律和科学原则可循。
    行政区域划分的一般规律是要适应经济和社会发展的需要，以经济、政治、社会等客观条件为行政区域划分的根本依据。行政区域划分的基本原则是要有利于人民群众行使管理国家和社会事务的民主权利，有利于国家行政管理，有利于社会主义建设，有利于各族人民的团结，并保持相对的稳定性。在社会主义初级阶段，行政区域划分在坚持上述基本原则的基础上，必须重点突出为经济服务的原则。因为社会主义初级阶段的中心任务是发展生产力和发展商品经济。行政区域划分突出为商品经济服务的原则，既是行政区划各项基本原则的集中体现，又是社会发展的客观要求。
    现阶段，行政区划突出为商品经济服务的原则要处理好三个方面的关系：（１）行政区划与经济区划的关系，促进区域商品经济的发育和发展；（２）方便行政管理与提高经济效益的关系，用经济效益作为衡量行政管理效益的根本标准；（３）实行民族自治、增进民族团结与发展少数民族区域经济的关系，既要尊重民族习俗，发展民族自治，更要开发少数民族地区经济，促进少数民族区域社会现代化。
    行政区划变更的决定因素是生产力。生产力的发展引起社会的变革，随着社会的变革而变更行政区划。一般情况下，行政区划变更发生在国家政治经济发展的重大历史转折时期，如国家政权的更换，经济制度或经济体制的变革等。在中国过去两千多年的历史上，行政区划的变更主要是在新的王朝和国家政权建立初期，政治的色彩比较浓。而当前，行政区划变更的根本原因和直接表现则是经济体制改革和商品经济发展的要求，是产品经济模式向商品经济模式转化的需要。
    　　　　变更行政区划，既要考虑减少行政区划的实际层次，又要考虑适当调整某些行政区划的幅度。
    层次和幅度是行政区域划分的两种基本形式，也是规范行政区划结构的两项基本内容。依据宪法规定，我国行政区划一般为三级，即（１）全国分为省、自治区、直辖市；（２）省、自治区分为县、自治县、市；（３）县分为乡、民族乡、镇。在设有自治州的地方，行政区划为四级。但实际上，省与县之间普遍设有地区或地级市，在县与乡之间有些地方设有区。地区和区名为省人民政府和县人民政府的派出机构，但实际上已形成一级行政实体。这样，我国行政区划层次实际是五级或六级。
    行政区划实际层次过多，影响管理效率。地区行政公署和区公所的设立，在人口众多或面积广阔的省（区），对区域行政管理和经济建设都起过一定的积极作用。但在人口较少、面积较小的省（区），地区行政公署和区公所的设置、形式、规模及其作用就很值得研究。为减少层次，提高效率，多数省（区）已陆续撤销了区公所。辽宁、江苏两省撤地建市，实行地市合并，收效甚好。但是，无论是撤地建市，还是撤区建乡，都影响重大，牵一发而动全身，必须进行认真充分的理论研究和理论准备，有步骤地慎重进行。
    减少区划层次是与调整区划幅度紧密相连的，层次和幅度是不可分割的统一体。目前我国同级行政区划大小不同，有些行政区域幅度过大，管理不便，指挥不灵，不利于经济的发展和人民群众的社会活动，并且在客观上造成许多中间环节。因此，为促进经济发展和方便国家行政管理，有必要适当调整某些行政区划的幅度。但由于历史的原因，我国行政区划层次究竟应该多少，各级行政区划幅度以多大为宜，以及划分层次和确立幅度的具体标准有哪些，目前还缺乏科学的理论研究。
    　　　　当前出现的“建市热”带来了许多问题，发展市镇制须积极稳步进行。既要促进工业化发展，又要有利于农业发展。
    社会主义初级阶段是由农业国向工业国转化的阶段。商品经济的发展，工业化的实现，都需要依托基地。农业社会向工业社会的转化过程，也是乡村社会都市化的过程。因此，行政区划必须适应并促进商品经济和工业化的发展，积极发展市镇建制，促进城乡经济的协调发展，共同繁荣。
    但目前在市镇建制工作中缺乏宏观规划和科学布局，出现了“建市热”，在一定程度上对国家经济过热产生了推波助澜的作用。改县建市的步子迈得过快，既冲击了农业生产，又浪费了大量耕地，增加了机构和编制。市带县制在一定程度上促进了城乡经济的协调发展。但有些市经济辐射能力较弱，且缺乏市带县的科学方法，形成了“市管县”，市对县的行政干预过多，增加了行政层次，对县的经济发展和横向联合产生了一定的牵制和阻碍效应。有些县级市则千方百计要升为地级市，要求带县。一个县级市的升格，一般需５亿投资，占用５０００亩土地，５年时间不能稳定，在人财物三方面都不利于经济建设。计划单列市虽不是一级行政区划，但它涉及到省、市关系和市、县关系，冲击了旧的省市体制。计划单列市体制，促进了区域经济的发展，但也带来了许多问题，需要在理论上加以探讨。
    发展市镇建制的根本目的是促进工业化的发展，因此发展市镇制必须积极稳步进行，科学处理城乡关系、工农关系，既要促进工业化的发展，又要有利于农业生产。这就要科学规划，统筹布局，建立科学合理的县市、乡镇结构体系。１９８０年国务院提出发展城市的方针是“控制大城市规模，合理发展中等城市，积极发展小城市”。８年来的实践证明这一方针是正确的。今后发展市镇制仍应坚持这一方针，积极而稳步地发展中小城市。
    改县建市和以市带县是发展市制的两条根本途径。改县建市要坚持城乡结合的方向，摒弃切块建市的模式，尤其注意工农业的协调发展。地市合并和以市带县要改革市管县的行政模式，突出“带”的功能和作用，形成以市为中心的区域经济，在行政上逐步过渡到市县都直接受省领导的体制，减少市对县的行政干预。
    推行镇制和以镇带村，是乡村社会向工业化和城市化发展的必由之路。小城镇接近农村，有调整城乡关系，发展城乡商品经济等多方面的功能。发展镇制重在为农村商品经济服务，促进生产型镇制的发展，尽可能地减少消费型镇制。同时，要积极引导乡村小型集镇区域经济发展，试行设立集镇管理区，加强集镇管理。
