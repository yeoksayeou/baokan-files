As the process of Namibian independence is about to begin, the senseless killing of innocent Namibian civilians continues, which is truly shocking.

In recent weeks, some pro-South African white groups have carried out several shooting incidents in Namibia. The most shocking incident occurred on March 4th, when seven students eating breakfast were suddenly gunned down by a white gang.

The white groups have used despicable tactics to disrupt the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435. South African troops have recently allowed non-Namibians to register as voters, attempting to change the possible advantage that the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) might have in the November elections. Behind these activities, one can easily see the shadow of South African apartheid.

Members of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group for Namibia have recently arrived in Namibia and begun their mission to maintain peace and supervise the elections. The tide of Namibian independence is unstoppable. All the out-of-step actions by the South African authorities can only serve as another reminder to the world that the process of Namibian independence will not be smooth sailing.

　　不合时宜
    在纳米比亚独立进程即将开始的时候，无辜的纳米比亚平民仍在遭到屠杀，着实令人震惊。
    最近数周内，一些亲南非的白人团体在纳米比亚接连制造了数起枪杀事件。最令人震惊的是，３月４日，７名正在用早餐的中学生骤然惨死于白人团伙的乱枪之下。
    白人集团用卑鄙手段破坏实施联合国安理会４３５号决议的事件层出不穷。南非部队最近还让非纳米比亚人进行选民登记，企图以此改变在１１月举行选举时西南非洲人民组织可能取得的优势。在这些活动的背后，人们不难窥见南非种族主义的阴影。
    联合国纳米比亚过渡时期援助团近日来已纷纷到达纳米比亚，开始执行维持和平和监督选举的使命。纳米比亚独立的大潮是挡不住的。南非当局一切不合时宜的举动只能再一次提醒世人，纳米比亚独立进程不会是一条坦途。
