Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Poland, which initiated and implemented economic reforms early and boldly, have recently experienced soaring prices during the price reform process, plunging them into increasingly severe inflationary difficulties.

According to reports, the inflation rate, primarily indicated by the retail price increase, was 76% in Yugoslavia in 1985 and reached 250% in 1988. In Hungary, the average annual rate was 6.5% from 1981 to 1986, and it rose to 16% in 1988. In Poland, the rate was 15% in 1985 and surged to around 74% in 1988.

The persistent rise in inflation has affected people's lives, hindered the healthy development of the economy, and impeded the smooth progress of reforms, making it a widely discussed issue.

Like other socialist countries, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Poland had long practiced a highly centralized planned pricing system, using administrative measures to maintain price stability. This played a positive role in a certain historical period but, with the development of the economic situation, led to a separation of prices from values. Prices failed to reflect changes in social labor consumption and supply-demand relationships, losing their role in optimizing resource allocation, stimulating enterprise operations, and activating the economy.

During the process of advancing price reforms and adjusting price structures, the overall price level will inevitably rise. This is because:

1. To rectify price relationships and correctly play the signaling role of prices for producers and consumers, the originally low prices of energy, raw materials, agricultural products, and other basic products need to be significantly increased.
2. Inefficient processing enterprises find it difficult to absorb the increased prices of basic products, inevitably passing on part of the price increase to consumers.
3. Originally, food and certain essential consumer goods had excessive price subsidies. When these subsidies are reduced or eliminated, price increases are unavoidable.
4. With the opening up to the outside world, deepening international division of labor, and linking domestic prices with international prices, the prices of some products will also rise. Therefore, during price reforms, a certain degree of increase in the overall price level is normal. If the timing of price reforms is appropriate and policies are coordinated, this pain will aid in the rationalization of the economic structure and the healthy development of the national economy.

However, the price increases faced by the three countries have shown signs of being out of control, obviously exceeding expectations.

Inflation is a complex economic phenomenon. Although the national conditions and reform practices of Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Poland are not entirely the same, the causes of inflation also differ, but the common point is that excessive consumption has led to macroeconomic imbalances, with social total demand far exceeding social total supply.

Since the 1960s, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Poland have successively prioritized rapidly improving people's living standards as the primary goal of economic development. However, they underestimated the actual level of productive forces, the level of technological progress, and the risks of utilizing foreign capital, overestimating the stimulative effect of consumption on production. They attempted to boost consumption levels through deficit budgets, excessive currency issuance, fiscal and financial policies, and borrowing foreign capital, pursuing a development path of "high investment, high speed, and high consumption." This led to consumption outpacing production, resulting in excessive consumption and uncontrolled growth of consumption funds. Even in recent years, when economic growth has been slow, consumption growth has not diminished. From 1980 to 1985, Yugoslavia's social product value grew by an average of 0.6% per year, while wages increased by an average of 40% per year. In 1986, the product value grew by 3.6%, and wages increased by 108%. In 1987, the product value decreased, but wages still increased by 105%. From 1981 to 1985, Hungary's national income grew by 7%, industrial labor productivity increased by 19%, and wages increased by 46%. However, in 1985 and 1986, production stagnated, but wages continued to rise. A Hungarian scholar said, "The only plan we consistently overfulfill is the growth of the consumption level." As for Poland, according to economist Grapevsky, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, national income decreased by more than 20% over four years, but residents' monetary income still increased by 160-170% under political pressure. In 1988, the gross national product grew by less than 5%, and the average wage of workers increased by 77.5%. The advance distribution of income accumulated a large amount of money in residents' hands, exceeding the normal supply capacity of society, forming a potential factor for pushing up prices.

During the transition from a product economy to a market economy, the three countries' enterprise reforms, although at different paces, have granted enterprises a certain degree of operational autonomy. However, competitive market conditions and self-regulating enterprise mechanisms have not yet fully formed. Therefore, in a situation where producers dominate the market, arbitrary price increases and disguised price hikes become simple means for enterprises to seek high profits. This abnormal income will not become funds for expanding production and increasing supply; instead, it becomes a source for expanding consumption funds. According to reports, some enterprises in Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Poland monopolize the production of certain products. The fact is that the enterprises that first illegally raised prices significantly were almost all in a monopolistic position. In 1986, more than 40% of Yugoslavia's enterprise revenue came from arbitrary price increases. In the first quarter of 1988, Polish state-owned enterprises raised wages by 20-30%, with the costs coming from the over-plan price increases of more than 20,000 products.

Price increases have strengthened social pressure to raise wages and subsidies, leading to a cycle of price and wage increases, driving the development of inflation.

Reforms being too hasty, overly idealizing market mechanisms, overly relying on free price adjustments, and lacking strong control measures are also common reasons why price reforms in the three countries have been ineffective and prices have been out of control.

Out-of-control prices have hindered the economic operations of the three countries, becoming a major obstacle to deepening reforms. Therefore, controlling inflation has become one of the basic economic goals. Their specific measures are roughly as follows: controlling currency issuance at the macro level, encouraging savings, and transferring people's money from durable consumer goods to production investment; controlling the growth of consumption funds, changing the linkage of wages with prices to the linkage of wages with enterprise performance and individual contributions; further adjusting the industrial structure, accelerating intensification and adapting to the development of the world economy, improving enterprise quality and economic benefits; strengthening market regulation.

Of course, the efforts to control inflation overall are inseparable from deepening economic and political reforms.

　　南、匈、波面对的通货膨胀困扰
    丹林
    经济改革起步早、步子大的南斯拉夫、匈牙利和波兰，近年来在价格改革过程中出现了物价飞涨的局势，陷入日趋严重的通货膨胀困扰之中。
    据报道，以零售价格涨幅为主要标志的通货膨胀率，在南斯拉夫１９８５年为７６％，１９８８年达到２５０％；在匈牙利，１９８１—１９８６年年均６．５％，１９８８年为１６％；在波兰，１９８５年为１５％，１９８８年达７４％左右。
    持续上升的通货膨胀影响了人民生活，妨碍了经济的健康发展，影响了改革的顺利进行，因而成为人们普遍关心和议论的问题。
    南匈波３国和其它社会主义国家一样，曾长期实行高度集中的计划价格体制，以行政手段保持物价平稳，这在一定的历史时期起过积极作用，但随着经济形势的发展，就造成价格与价值分离，价格不能反映社会劳动消耗和供需关系变化，失去了优化资源配置、刺激企业经营和活跃经济的作用。
    在推进价格改革、调整价格结构的过程中，价格总水平会有所上升。这是因为：１，要理顺价格关系、正确发挥价格对生产者和消费者的信号作用，原先过低的能源、原材料、农产品等基础产品价格要大幅度提高；２，效益不高的加工企业难以消化基础产品价格的提高，必然会把一部分提价转嫁给消费者；３，原来食品、某些必需消费品的价格补贴过多，当削减或取消补贴时，价格上涨便无法避免的；４，在对外开放、深入国际分工、国内价格与国际价格挂钩时，部分产品价格也会有所上涨。因此，在价格改革中，价格总水平出现一定程度的提高是正常的。若价格改革选择的时机合适，政策配套，这种阵痛会有助于经济结构合理化和国民经济的健康发展。
    然而，３国面临的物价上涨具有失控的特点，显然超出了人们的预料。
    通货膨胀是一种复杂的经济现象。南匈波３国的国情和改革做法虽不尽相同，诱发通货膨胀的原因也有差异，但共同点是消费过度造成宏观经济失调，社会总需求大大超过社会总供给。
    ６０年代以来，南匈波３国相继把迅速提高人民生活水平作为发展经济的首要目标，但对实际生产力发展水平、科技进步程度以及利用外资的风险估计不足，夸大了消费对生产的刺激作用，从而试图通过赤字预算、超常增发货币的财政金融政策和借用外资、推行“高投资、高速度、高消费”的发展道路把消费水平促上去，结果导致消费超前于生产，形成消费过度、消费基金增长失控。近年来经济增长即使缓慢，消费增长仍不衰减。１９８０—１９８５年南斯拉夫社会产值年均增长０．６％，而工资年均增长４０％；１９８６年产值增长３．６％，工资增长１０８％；１９８７年产值下降工资仍增长１０５％。１９８１—１９８５年间的匈牙利国民收入增长７％，工业劳动生产率增长１９％，工资增长４６％，而１９８５、１９８６年其生产停滞，工资仍继续增加。一位匈牙利学者说：“我们唯一经常超额完成计划的是消费水平的增长。”至于波兰，据波经济学家格拉帕夫斯基说，在７０年代末、８０年代初的４年间，国民收入下降２０％以上，而居民货币收入在政治要求压力下仍提高了１６０—１７０％。。１９８８年国民生产总值增长不到５％，职工平均工资增长了７７．５％。超前分配使居民手中积累起大量超过社会正常供货能力的货币，形成了抬高物价的潜在因素。
    在产品经济向市场经济转变过程中，３国的企业改革虽迈出不同步伐，企业取得了一定的经营自主权，但竞争的市场条件和具有自我约束性的企业机制尚未完全形成。因此，在生产者操纵市场的情况下，乱涨价和变相提价就成为企业谋取高额利润的简易手段。这种超常收入不会成为扩大生产、增加供给的资金，相反，却成为扩大消费基金的来源。据报道，南、匈、波有些企业垄断了某些产品的生产。事实是，率先非法大幅度涨价的几乎都是处于垄断地位的企业。１９８６年南斯拉夫企业增收中有４０％以上来自乱涨价。１９８８年首季，波兰国营企业提高工资２０％—３０％，其费用就来自２万余种产品的超计划提价。
    物价上涨强化了社会上要求提高工资和补贴的压力，导致物价和工资轮番上涨，推动着通货膨胀的发展。
    改革操之过急、对市场机制过于理想化、过份依赖价格的自由调节、缺乏强有力的监控手段也是３国价格改革难有成效、物价失控的共同原因之一。
    失控的物价妨碍了３国经济运行，成为深化改革的拦路虎，因此，控制通货膨胀成为基本经济目标之一。它们的具体做法大致是：宏观上控制货币发行，鼓励储蓄，把人民手中的钱从耐用消费品转向生产投资；控制消费基金增长，改工资与物价挂钩为工资与企业效益、个人贡献挂钩；进一步调整产业结构，加速集约化和对世界经济发展的适应能力，提高企业素质和经济效益；加强市场调控。
    当然，在总体上控制通货膨胀的努力与深化经济改革、政治改革是密不可分的。
