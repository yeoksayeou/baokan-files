Last year, the global economy weathered the shock of the October 1987 worldwide stock market crisis. Not only did it avoid the feared economic recession, but it also achieved accelerated growth. According to estimates from the United Nations Economic Department at the end of last year, the global economic growth rate increased from 3.2% in 1987 to 4.3% in 1988. The 1988 growth rate was the highest since 1984, surpassing the average growth rate of 2.9% from 1981 to 1987. Global trade also accelerated, with exports increasing by 7% in 1988 (compared to 5% in 1987), which was double the average growth rate of the 1980s. However, the development of the global economy remains highly uneven, with significant disparities in growth among different types of countries.

Developed countries in the West have experienced six consecutive years of accelerated growth. The average growth rate of the 24 OECD member countries increased from 3.3% in 1987 to 4% in 1988. In the United States, the growth rate increased from 3.4% to 3.9%, while in Japan, it rose from 4.2% to 5.5%, and in Western Europe, it increased from 2.8% to 3.5%. The acceleration of Western economies after the stock market crisis is noteworthy. Generally, the following factors contributed to this:

1. In the previous few years, productive investment in Western countries has been sluggish, with a large amount of excess capital flowing into the stock and securities markets. After the stock market crash, the United States and other developed countries implemented relatively loose monetary policies to avoid a recession, making productive investment more attractive. This provided a significant boost to the economy.

2. Last year, major developed countries strengthened the coordination of their macroeconomic policies to correct trade and external payment imbalances. The U.S. current account deficit decreased from $150 billion in 1987 to $130 billion in 1988, while Japan and West Germany's combined current account surplus decreased from $132 billion in 1987 to $120 billion in 1988.

3. Over the past decade, structural reforms in Western countries have, to some extent, improved corporate efficiency and technological levels, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the economic structure. This has played a positive role in the sustained growth of Western economies.

4. Last year, the price of oil dropped by 20%, which helped Western countries curb inflationary pressures and increase policy flexibility.

Most developing countries see little economic improvement and face numerous challenges. In stark contrast to the growth of developed countries, developing countries as a whole have seen little economic improvement. In 1988, the average growth rate of developing countries (excluding China) was 2.9%, roughly the same as the previous year's 2.7%. Moreover, their development is highly uneven, with East Asia and South Asia growing by 7.4%, the Middle East by 1%, Mediterranean countries by 3%, Africa by 2.4%, and Latin America by only 0.7%. In recent years, developing countries have made numerous efforts to adjust their domestic economies, but they still face an unfavorable international economic environment, primarily characterized by:

Weak primary commodity prices. In the first half of last year, the prices of non-oil primary commodities rose by 20% compared to the same period the previous year. However, after accounting for the increase in manufactured goods prices, the actual increase was only 10%, still 30% lower than the levels of 1979-1980. As for oil-exporting countries, due to the drop in oil prices, their terms of trade have declined by approximately 10%.

Increased trade protectionism. In recent years, developed countries have continually increased restrictions on competitive products from developing countries, making their exports even more difficult.

Heavy debt burdens. By the end of last year, the total external debt of developing countries reached $1.32 trillion, accounting for approximately half of their combined GDP.

The Soviet Union and Eastern European countries have seen increased economic growth but still face obstacles. Last year, the average growth rate of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries increased from 2.6% the previous year to 4.5%. The Soviet Union's economic reforms have transitioned from the conceptual and experimental stages to the implementation phase.

Over the past year, laws and regulations related to state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and individual labor, as well as multiple resolutions on economic reforms, have come into effect, providing a more comprehensive legal foundation for the reforms. Due to significant investment growth, economic activity has greatly accelerated, with an estimated growth rate of 4.7% (compared to 2.3% the previous year). Eastern European countries continued to implement reform and adjustment measures, while significantly increasing investment (ranging from 3% to 10%), leading to accelerated economic growth, reaching 4.4% last year (compared to 3.2% the previous year).

In addition, these countries have made significant progress in expanding exports, reducing international payment deficits, and decreasing external debt.

However, these countries still face numerous challenges. The Soviet Union's reforms have encountered many obstacles and are unlikely to yield short-term results. In 1988, agricultural production was poor, grain output decreased, and long-standing shortages in the consumer goods market have worsened.

Some Eastern European countries faced setbacks in price reforms last year, leading to economic imbalances, exacerbated inflation, and social unrest. All of these factors will have adverse effects on future economic development.

Looking ahead to this year, economic growth may slow, and risks remain. Although the global economic situation was favorable last year, many unstable factors and risks still exist, which will affect this year's economic development and slow down the growth rate. These factors and risks mainly include:

1. The United States still maintains a massive budget deficit and trade deficit, with figures for the 1988 fiscal year at approximately $155 billion and $137.3 billion, respectively. The existence of these two deficits will have adverse effects on the financial markets, investor confidence, and the overall economy of the United States and other Western countries.

2. In the process of addressing the stock market crisis, many Western countries implemented relatively loose monetary policies, leading to economic overheating and rising inflation in some countries. Therefore, since the second half of last year, Western countries have had to gradually raise interest rates and implement tighter monetary policies. This will lead to a decrease in investment this year.

3. Although there has been some easing of the severe imbalances in trade and external payments among major developed countries, the fundamental problems have not been resolved. The facts show that relying solely on exchange rate adjustments is insufficient to reverse the imbalances, and it is practically difficult for the relevant parties to adjust their own economic structures. Currently, the implementation of tighter monetary policies by each side has increased the difficulties in coordination.

　　当前世界经济形势管见
    郭集思
    去年，世界经济经受住了１９８７年１０月全球性股市危机的冲击，不仅没有发生人们担心的经济衰退，而且实现了加速增长。据联合国经济部门去年底估计（下同），世界经济的增长率从１９８７年３．２％升至１９８８年４．３％。１９８８年的增长率为１９８４年以来的最高点，超过了１９８１—１９８７年的平均增长率（２．９％）。世界贸易也加快增长，１９８８年出口量增长７％（１９８７年为５％），是８０年代平均增长率的２倍。但世界经济的发展依然很不平衡，各类国家的增长情况参差不齐。
    西方发达国家连续６年增长　速度加快
    经合组织２４个发达国家的平均增长率从１９８７年３．３％升至１９８８年４％，其中美国从３．４％升至３．９％，日本从４．２％升至５．５％，西欧从２．８％升至３．５％。西方经济去年在股市危机之后出现增长加速，耐人寻味。一般看来，有如下原因：
    １、前几年，西方国家的生产性投资一直不振，大量过剩资本流入股票和证券市场。股市暴跌后，美国和其他发达国家为避免衰退，实行了较为宽松的货币政策，使生产性投资变得更具吸引力，这给经济以很大刺激。
    ２、去年主要发达国家为纠正它们之间的贸易和对外收支不平衡，加强了宏观经济政策的协调。美国经常项目逆差从１９８７年１５００亿美元降至１９８８年１３００亿美元，而日本和西德两国的经常项目盈余从１９８７年合计为１３２０亿美元降至１９８８年１２００亿美元。
    ３、１０年来西方国家进行的结构改革，在一定程度上提高了企业的效率和技术水平，增强了经济结构的灵活性和应变能力。这对西方经济的持续增长发挥了积极作用。
    ４、去年石油价格下跌了２０％，也有利于西方国家抑制通货膨胀压力，增加政策回旋余地。
    大多数发展中国家经济改善不大　困难不少
    同发达国家经济增长形成鲜明对比的是，发展中国家作为一个整体，经济仍无起色，１９８８年发展中国家（不包括中国）平均增长２．９％，与上一年２．７％大致相同。而且它们的发展很不平衡，东亚和南亚增长７．４％，西亚１％，地中海沿岸国家３％，非洲２．４％，拉美仅为０．７％。近年来，发展中国家在调整本国经济方面作出了许多努力，但仍面临不利的国际经济环境，其中主要是：
    初级产品价格疲软。去年上半年，非石油初级产品价格比上一年同期上升２０％，但扣除制成品价格上涨因素，实际上升１０％，仍比１９７９—１９８０年的水平低３０％。至于石油出口国，由于油价下跌，它们的贸易条件下降约１０％。
    贸易保护主义加剧。近年来，发达国家针对发展中国家具有竞争力的产品不断增加限制措施，使它们的出口更加困难。
    外债负担沉重。截至去年年底，发展中国家的外债总额达１．３２万亿美元，约占它们全部国民生产总值的一半。
    苏联东欧国家经济增长上升　仍有阻力
    去年苏联东欧国家的平均增长率从上一年２．６％升至４．５％。苏联的经济改革从构想、试验进入了配套实施阶段。
    一年来，国营企业法、合作社法和个体劳动法以及有关经济改革的多项决议陆续生效，使改革有了较完备的法律基础。由于投资增长较大，经济活动大为加快，估计增长率可达４．７％（上一年为２．３％）。东欧国家继续实行改革调整措施，同时较大幅度地增加投资（从３％到１０％不等），因此经济增长速度加快，去年达４．４％（上一年为３．２％）。
    此外，这些国家在扩大出口、缩小国际收支逆差和减少外债方面也取得了较多进展。
    但是，这些国家仍面临不少困难。苏联的改革遇到许多阻力，难以在短期内收效。１９８８年农业歉收，粮食产量下降，长期存在的消费品市场供应紧张有所加剧。
    东欧一些国家去年价格改革受挫，引起了国民经济比例失调，加剧了通货膨胀和社会动荡。所有这些都将对今后的经济发展产生不利影响。
    展望今年形势增长可能放慢　隐患仍存
    尽管去年世界经济形势良好，但许多不稳定因素和隐患依然存在，必将影响今年的经济发展，使其经济增长速度减慢。这些因素和隐患主要是：
    １、美国仍然保持着巨额预算赤字和外贸赤字，在１９８８年度分别约为１５５０亿美元和１３７３亿美元。这两个赤字的存在将对美国和西方其它国家的金融市场、投资者的信心乃至整个经济产生不良影响。
    ２、在西方国家对付股市危机而执行较为宽松的货币政策过程中，不少国家出现了经济过热、通货膨胀上升的现象。因此，从去年下半年以来，西方国家不得不陆续调高利率，实行较为紧缩的货币政策。这将使它们今年的投资下降。
    ３、主要发达国家之间在贸易和对外收支方面的严重失衡，虽有缓和，但根本问题并没有解决。事实说明单靠调整汇率不足以扭转失衡，而若要有关双方各自调整本身经济结构，实际上很难做到。目前，各自执行较为紧缩的货币政策，又增加了协调的困难。
