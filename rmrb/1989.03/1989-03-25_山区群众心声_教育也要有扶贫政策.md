The current educational situation in some economically backward mountainous areas is extremely poor. Taking Zhaoqing City as an example, out of its twelve counties and districts, nine are mountainous. The educational challenges faced by these mountainous areas are quite prominent. Firstly, educational funding is severely insufficient. In Deqing County and Yunnan County, the salaries of teachers alone account for 89.5% and 91.55% of the budget, respectively, leaving only 10% for actual educational expenses. Secondly, the facilities in mountainous schools are poor and often incomplete. In Yunnan County's Doucheng Town, this autumn, there will be over 700 school-aged children, but due to a lack of classrooms, they face difficulties in enrolling. Thirdly, the teaching staff is unstable. Last year, the entire city had 285 teachers leave the educational sector, and 168 teachers left without notice.

Some backward regions have achieved good results through implementing poverty alleviation policies. To change the backward state of education in mountainous areas, educational poverty alleviation should also be implemented. First, in terms of educational funding, poverty alleviation should be provided, and special funds should be allocated to support work-study programs in mountainous schools to enhance their self-reliance. Second, in the distribution of materials and resources, poverty alleviation should be considered. Third, in the allocation of teachers, poverty alleviation should be prioritized. Every year, the distribution of graduates from normal universities should favor mountainous areas, and these graduates should be given preferential treatment to encourage them to willingly go to and settle in mountainous areas. Fourth, in targeted training, poverty alleviation should be implemented. Targeted training indicators and funds should be directly allocated to mountainous counties for specialized use. Only in this way can the backward state of education in mountainous areas be changed.

　　山区群众心声——
    教育也要有扶贫政策
    目前，一些经济落后山区的教育现状极差，以肇庆市为例，十二个县区有九个山区县，凡是山区的教育面临的困难都很突出，首先是教育经费严重不足，仅是教师们的人头费用，德庆县和郁南县就占去百分之八十九点五和百分之九十一点五五，真正用于办教育的只有百分之十。其次，山区学校设施较差，而且多不配套。郁南县都城镇今年秋季将有七百多适龄儿童，由于缺教室导致入学困难。再次，教师队伍不稳定。全市去年有二百八十五名教师调离教育战线，有一百六十八名教师不辞而别。
    一些落后地区，通过实行扶贫政策后取得较好的效果。为改变山区教育的落后状况，也应该实行教育扶贫。一是在教育经费上扶贫，同时，设专款扶持山区学校的勤工俭学，增强其自救能力。二是在分配物资材料时扶贫。三是在分配教师时扶贫，每年师范院校毕业生的分配，应多分给山区，并给这些毕业生以优惠的待遇，让其乐意去山区、安心在山区。四是在定向培养上扶贫，定向培养指标和经费直接拨给山区县，专款专用，只有这样，才有可能改变山区教育的落后面貌。
