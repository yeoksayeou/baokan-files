The China Democratic League (CDL) has made strides in institutionalizing democratic supervision in recent years. However, due to various reasons, when political consultants go on inspection tours, they often go through the motions and find it difficult to learn the true situation. On this issue, the CDL group at the discussion meeting strongly called for knowing the truth.

	▲ Wú Hànjiā (Vice Chairman of the CDL Sichuan Provincial Committee): To ensure that democratic supervision is effective, the first step is to know the facts. One must know the party and government affairs from above and the people's sentiments and opinions from below. Only by knowing the facts can one discuss politics. Governments at all levels should increase transparency, not only reporting achievements but also reporting problems.

	▲ Luó Hánxiān (Vice Chairman of the CDL Central Committee): Every year, the inspection tours by political consultants are too concentrated and the scale is too large. Last time, a delegation of over 200 people actually became a sightseeing group. I think a delegation of three or four people would be sufficient.

	▲ Hóu Xuéyù (Vice Chairman of the CDL Central Committee Science and Technology Commission, renowned ecologist): Once, we four political consultants went on an inspection tour, and a large group of people accompanied us for meals. I see three major drawbacks to this: it wastes the state's money, it wastes everyone's time, and it puts a noose around our necks because we can't speak up after eating someone's meal. I suggest refusing invitations to meals in the future. Political consultants should become models for changing bad social practices.

	▲ Qián Wěicháng (Vice Chairman of the CDL Central Committee, renowned scientist): We can propose a motion on this issue in the CDL. Currently, there is layer upon layer of accompaniment, from the province, city, county, and district, and there are security personnel as well. It's really something to see a whole convoy following behind. I am most afraid of going to factories. Some of the accompanying personnel would ask the factory for things, and when I turned around, there was an additional car, all filled with things from the factory, and the people would hold us accountable for these expenses. In the future, regulations should be made to limit such large-scale accompaniment.

	▲ Wáng Dānfēng (Member of the CDL Central Committee, film actor from Shanghai Film Studio): Every time we go on an inspection tour, the unit prepares in advance, resulting in problems being covered up and sharp issues being smoothed over. I suggest that in the future, inspection tours should not be arranged in advance, and then a large group of people should rush in.

	▲ Hóu Xuéyù: I also have a worry. Every time we return from an inspection tour, the reports are written by others, and our own reports are ignored.

	▲ Mǎ Dàyuì (Vice Chairman of the CDL Central Committee): Inspection reports should be written by the consultants themselves. If professional staff write them, they often cater to the intentions of their superiors and dare not touch on certain issues.

	▲ Qián Wěicháng: Once, in a province, I asked how they got their figures. They replied that they came from the statistics bureau. I asked where the statistics bureau got their figures, and they said from the townships. I then asked the township officials, and they told me that they would provide whatever the higher-ups wanted. Everyone writes materials in two ways, one good and one bad, and they provide whatever you want. There is a lot of water in these figures.

	Knowing the truth and not falsehoods has become a hot topic at the CDL group discussion meeting.

　　要知真情        
    ——政协民盟小组讨论会旁听录
    本报记者  孟晓云  凌志军
    民盟近年来在民主监督制度化上已迈出一步，但是由于各种原因，政协委员下去视察工作往往走了过场，很难了解真实情况。对此，民盟小组在讨论会上要知真情的呼声强烈。
    ▲吴汉家（民盟四川省副主委）：为了保证民主监督卓有成效，首先要知情，上知党务政务，下知民情民意，知情才能议政。各级政府要增加透明度，不仅通报成绩，还要通报问题。
    ▲罗涵先（民盟中央副主席）：每年政协委员视察太集中，规模也太大，上次有个团２００多人，实际成了参观团。我看一个团三四个人就可以了。
    ▲侯学煜（民盟中央科技委员会副主任、著名生态学家）：有一次，我们四个政协委员下去视察，陪吃的人一大堆。我看这有三大坏处，浪费了国家的钱财，耽误了大家的时间，我们的脖子也被“套”住了，吃了人家的嘴短嘛。我建议今后拒绝吃请，政协委员应该成为改变社会上不良风气的模范。
    ▲钱伟长（民盟中央副主席、著名科学家）：这个问题我们民盟可以搞个提案。现在是层层陪，省、市、县、区，还有保卫人员，真是不得了，回头一看，后面跟着一个车队。我最怕去工厂，一些陪同者向工厂伸手，我再一回头，后面多了一辆车，全是工厂送的东西，而这些账群众要算到我们头上。今后应做出规定，限制这种大批人马的陪同。
    ▲王丹凤（民盟中央常委、上影厂电影演员）：每次去视察，单位都事先有准备，结果，问题被遮掩了，尖锐的东西磨圆了。建议今后视察，不要事先安排，尔后大队人马一拥而去。
    ▲侯学煜：我还有一个苦恼，每次视察回来报告都由笔杆子写，而我们自己写的报告无人理会。
    ▲马大猷（民盟中央副主席）：视察报告应由委员自己写，专职干部去写，往往迎合上级的意图，有些问题他们不敢碰。
    ▲钱伟长：有一次，我在一个省里问，你们的数字怎么来的？他们答，统计局来的。我问统计局数字哪里来，他们说乡里来的；又问乡里，乡里干部告诉我，上面要什么我们给什么。层层写材料都准备两手，一手好材料一手坏材料，你要什么我写什么，水分很多。
    要知真情不要知假情，成为民盟小组讨论会的热门话题之一。
