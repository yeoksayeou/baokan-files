Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, sent a telegram today to the Chairman of the United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid, Galba, expressing appreciation for the committee's unremitting efforts in supporting the South African people in their struggle to completely eradicate racial discrimination and the apartheid system. Premier Li Peng sent this telegram on the occasion of the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. In the telegram, he stated that the Chinese government and people strongly condemn the South African government's racial discrimination and apartheid system, and resolutely support the South African people in their just struggle for racial equality and basic human rights.

Li Peng pointed out that the South African government stubbornly persists in its racial discrimination and apartheid system, wantonly trampling on and depriving the vast majority of black people of their basic rights, refusing to implement relevant United Nations resolutions, and continually strengthening its reactionary policies, which have been strongly condemned and opposed by people around the world.

He said that through the long-term struggle of the people of Southern Africa and the joint efforts of the international community, the situation in Southern Africa is developing in a positive direction. The United Nations Security Council's Resolution 435 on the independence of Namibia will come into effect on April 1 this year, marking the end of South Africa's illegal rule over Namibia.

He said that the South African government should follow the trend of history, abandon its unpopular apartheid and racial discrimination policies.

The United Nations Special Committee Against Apartheid was established in 1962 in accordance with a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly and consists of 18 member states. In 1966, the 21st session of the General Assembly passed a resolution designating March 21 as the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in memory of the Sharpeville massacre on March 21, 1960, when South Africa suppressed black resistance.

　　李鹏致电联合国反对种族隔离特委会        
    支持南非人民正义斗争
    本报北京３月２１日讯  李鹏总理今天打电报给联合国反对种族隔离特委会主席加尔巴，对特委会为支援南非人民彻底根除种族歧视和种族隔离制度而进行的不懈努力表示赞赏。李鹏总理是在纪念联合国“消除种族歧视国际日”之际发出这份电报的。他在电报中说，中国政府和人民强烈谴责南非当局的种族歧视和种族隔离制度，坚决支持南非人民争取种族平等和基本人权的正义斗争。
    李鹏指出，南非当局顽固坚持种族歧视和种族隔离制度，肆意践踏和剥夺广大黑人的基本权利，拒不执行联合国的有关决议，不断强化其反动政策，受到全世界人民的强烈谴责和反对。
    他说，经过南部非洲人民长期的斗争和国际社会的共同努力，南部非洲的局势正在朝着积极的方向发展。联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议将于今年４月１日开始实施，南非对纳米比亚的非法统治就要结束。
    他说，南非当局应该顺应历史潮流，放弃不得人心的种族隔离和种族歧视政策。
    联合国反对种族隔离特委会是根据联合国大会的决议于１９６２年设立的，由１８个会员国组成。１９６６年，第二十一届联大通过决议，决定把每年３月２１日定为“消除种族歧视国际日”，以纪念１９６０年３月２１日南非为镇压黑人反抗而造成的沙佩维尔惨案。
