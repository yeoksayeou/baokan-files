    A Breeding Specialized Village Emerges in Sanya
    Sanya, March 1 (Xinhua) — The commercial economy has shattered the shackles of old production concepts, and farmers in Sanya, who have been engaged in seed production for decades, have suddenly realized that breeding and seed production is also an industry. This spring, three breeding specialized villages and 267 specialized households have emerged in the suburbs of Sanya City. The city's 52,000 mu (3,467 hectares) of seed production base has increased income by 5.2 million yuan.

    Located at the southernmost tip of China, Sanya enjoys abundant sunlight and is a natural greenhouse. China's grain breeding and seed production base has been established in Sanya for 20 years. This spring, 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions are producing seeds in Sanya. There are more than 700 large and small seed research institutions alone.

    三亚出现育种专业村
    本报三亚3月1日电　记者罗自苏报道：商品经济冲破旧生产观念的桎梏，搞了几十年南繁制种的三亚农民豁然悟出育种制种也是一个产业。今年春耕，三亚市郊涌现3个育种专业村，267个专业户。全市5.2万亩制种基地增收520万元。
    我国最南端的三亚地区日照充足，是得天独厚的天然温室。我国粮食育种制种基地已在三亚搞了20年。今年春，有28个省市自治区在三亚制种，单是大大小小的制种科研机构就多达700多个。
