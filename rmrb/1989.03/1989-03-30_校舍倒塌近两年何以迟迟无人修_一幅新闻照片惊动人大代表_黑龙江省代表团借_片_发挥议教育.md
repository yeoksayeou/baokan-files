A news photograph published in a newspaper has sparked a discussion among the delegation from Heilongjiang Province at the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress. The representatives are debating: Who should we appeal to in order to change the backward state of education?

On March 27th, the first page of the People's Daily featured a news photograph titled "Primary School Collapsed Nearly Two Years Ago." The photograph criticized the fact that the school building in Xiaodezi Village, Xubao Township, Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, had collapsed nearly two years ago and had not been repaired, forcing students to study in private homes. Wang Rensheng, the director of the Standing Committee of the Harbin Municipal People's Congress, spoke at the meeting that day, saying, "Hulan County is under the jurisdiction of Harbin City. The media's exposure of this issue is good; it will prompt us to improve our work more quickly." Mayor Gong Benshan of Harbin City told reporters, "Hulan County has suffered three consecutive years of flooding. In February, I and several other city leaders visited 12 schools and found that the county has 27,567 square meters of dilapidated and collapsed buildings. We immediately decided to raise 6.88 million yuan to eliminate all dilapidated and collapsed buildings within a year. Currently, we are implementing this decision." He said that the newspaper's criticism reminded us to handle this matter thoroughly from beginning to end.

The critical report prompted the representatives to reflect: Should we only appeal to the government to change the backward state of education? Gong Benshan said, "Education is a matter for the entire nation, and the whole society should mobilize."

Cong Fuku said, "We cannot just complain to the government; merely complaining will not solve the problem. He believes that responsibilities for education should be clearly defined: first, the responsibilities that the state should bear; second, the responsibilities of various aspects of society; and third, the responsibilities of education itself. Wang Wuru proposed: The education department should also appeal to itself. Currently, the situation is that while we complain about insufficient education funds, the limited funds are all consumed by personnel expenses. The low efficiency of education causes a large amount of resources to be wasted."

Many representatives said that the state should, within its financial capabilities, gradually increase education funds each year. At the same time, every member of society should appeal to themselves: What have you done to revitalize education?

　　校舍倒塌近两年何以迟迟无人修        
    一幅新闻照片惊动人大代表        
    黑龙江省代表团借“片”发挥议教育
    新华社北京３月２９日电  （《黑龙江日报》记者武从端、本社记者徐江善）报纸上刊登的一幅新闻图片，在七届人大二次会议黑龙江省代表团引起反响。代表们议论的主题是：改变教育落后的现状应该“向谁喊”？
    ３月２７日，《人民日报》一版刊登一幅题为《小学倒塌近两年》的新闻图片，批评黑龙江省呼兰县许堡乡小得子村小学校舍倒塌近两年得不到修建，学生在农户家上课。哈尔滨市人大常委会主任王人生代表当日看到报纸后在会上发言说，呼兰县是哈市辖县，新闻单位披露这件事很好，他能促使我们更快改进工作。哈尔滨市市长宫本言代表对记者说：“呼兰县连续三年受涝灾，今年２月，我与其他几位市领导前去看了１２所学校，发现这个县学校有危倒房２７５６７平方米。并当场作出决定：筹款６８８万元，一年内全部‘消灭’危倒房，目前正在落实中。”他说，报纸的批评提醒我们把这件事自始至终抓好。
    批评报道引起代表们的深思：改变教育落后是否只向政府“喊”。宫本言代表说：教育是全民族的事业，全社会都要动员起来。
    丛福奎代表说，我们不能只向政府叫苦，光抱怨也不解决问题，他认为对教育要分清责任，一是国家应负的责任，二是社会各方面的责任，三是教育本身的责任。王吾如代表提出：教育部门应该向自己“喊一喊”。现在的情况是，一边喊教育经费不足，一边有限的经费都被“人头”费吃掉了。教育的高速低效，造成大量资金浪费。
    许多代表说，国家应该在财力允许情况下，逐年增加教育经费。同时，社会的每一个成员都应该向自己“喊一喊”：你为振兴教育做了什么。
