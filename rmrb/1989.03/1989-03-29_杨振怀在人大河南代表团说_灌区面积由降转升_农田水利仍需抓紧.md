    Yang Zhenhuai said at the People's Congress Henan Delegation that the trend of decreasing irrigated area in China has been reversed. He hopes that all localities will continue to focus on agricultural water conservancy construction and strengthen the protection of existing facilities.

    Yang Zhenhuai said that in the past two years, various places have focused on water conservancy construction, increasing the irrigated area by 10 million mu and restoring and improving the irrigated area by 40 million mu.

    He said that every year, China suffers from drought and flood disasters affecting about 400 million mu of land, reducing grain production by 100 to 200 billion kilograms. If water conservancy facilities are well constructed, not only can we prevent and mitigate disasters and minimize grain losses, but we can also provide a guarantee for increased production.

　　杨振怀在人大河南代表团说  
    灌区面积由降转升  农田水利仍需抓紧
    新华社北京３月２８日电  （记者周晓农）水利部部长杨振怀２７日下午在河南省代表团参加讨论时谈到，我国灌区面积逐年下降的局面已得到扭转，希望各地继续抓好农田水利建设，加强现有设施保护。
    杨振怀说，近两年，各地大抓水利建设，已增加灌溉面积１０００万亩，恢复和改善灌溉面积４０００万亩。
    他说，我国每年受到旱灾洪涝面积约达４亿亩，减少粮食产量一二百亿公斤。如果水利设施搞得好，我们不仅能防灾抗灾，尽量减少粮食的损失，而且还能为增产提供保障。
