Title: The Heat of Fundraising Needs to Cool Down

The heat of fundraising, in some places, has become excessive and it is time to cool it down.

Recently, the National Bureau of Statistics released the 1988 annual report, which is quite thought-provoking. Fixed asset investment, despite repeated efforts to control it, continues to expand, mainly due to the inability to manage extra-budgetary investments. Approximately 60% of the total investment, which comes from local governments, departments, and enterprises themselves, does not shrink even under pressure and continues to inflate.

Diversifying funding sources is indeed necessary for the development of a socialist commodity economy. Self-raised investments play a significant role in mobilizing enthusiasm and solving funding difficulties. However, everything has its limits. Truth can become falsehood if taken to extremes. Currently, fundraising seems to have become a fashionable trend, with a wide scope and rapid pace. In some places, almost every sector, including industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and even hospitals, is engaged in fundraising, justifying it as "building your own stage and performing your own show" and "blazing new trails and exploring multiple avenues."

Excessive fundraising will inevitably lead to disasters. Consider the following:

It undermines macroeconomic control. When you tighten the monetary policy and reduce the scale of construction projects and fixed asset investments, others find a way around it. In some places, the funds raised are used to expand fixed asset investments by as much as 70%. If this continues, controlling economic overheating may become impossible!

It hinders the rational adjustment of the economic structure. Some low-quality products, products, and industries that need to be phased out continue to exist in the market because they have received "blood transfusions" and "heart stimulants."

Blind fundraising saves what should not be saved and squeezes out what should be promoted. Some places, in order to raise funds, offer interest rates that are one to several times higher than bank rates, causing a massive transfer of savings deposits. Some turn internal enterprise fundraising into a mandatory levy, even linking it to wages, promotions, and housing allocations.

In the process of rectifying economic order and improving the economic environment, such fundraising practices should undoubtedly be rectified.

Is "building your own stage and performing your own show" correct? It depends on whether the stage should be built and the show should be performed. In the next two years, we need to focus on rectification and regulation. If everyone arbitrarily raises funds to build stages and perform shows, the number of stages will keep increasing, and the shows will become more and more chaotic. Total demand will continue to exceed total supply, and inflation and price increases will not be effectively controlled. How can this be tolerated!

Ignoring the overall situation and "blazing new trails and exploring multiple avenues" is absolutely unacceptable.

Fundraising is not something that should not be done, but it should not be done recklessly. Fundraising should follow certain rules and have the correct guidance. Recently, relevant departments have issued several regulations on enterprise fundraising. It is hoped that this trend can cool down and be brought back to a regular track.

### 集资热要降温

　　集资热要降温
    集资热，有的地方热得过分，该是降温的时候了。
    最近国家统计局发布的１９８８年年度公报耐人寻味，固定资产投资屡压屡胀，主要是管不住预算外投资。约占总额６０％的地方、部门及企业的自筹投资，压而不缩，甚至继续膨胀。
    多渠道地筹集资金，本是发展社会主义商品经济的需要。自筹投资在调动各方积极性、解决资金困难等方面的作用是明显的。但凡事总得适度，真理过了一分也会成谬误。眼下，集资似乎成了“时髦”之举，范围大，上得猛，有的地方几乎工、农、商、学以至医院，都搞集资，还美其名曰：这是“自己搭台自己唱戏”，“独辟蹊径，多方开拓”。
    泛滥，必然成灾。请看：
    它冲击了宏观调控。你来抽紧银根，压缩基建规模和固定资产投资；他则来个“网开一面”。有的地方集资所得，用于扩大固定资产投资的竟达７０％。这样下去，抑制经济过热，岂非有落空的危险！
    它使经济结构难以合理调整。某些劣质产品，需要淘汰的产品和行业，由于“输了血”，打了“强心针”，得以继续混迹于市场。
    盲目集资，救了不该救的，挤掉了应该上的。有些地方为搞到资金，不惜以高出银行１倍甚至更多的利率来吸引资金，造成储蓄存款大搬家；有的把企业内部集资搞成摊派，甚至与工资、升级、分房等挂起钩来。
    在整顿经济秩序、治理经济环境中，如此这般的集资，无疑应属整治之列。
    “自己搭台自己唱戏”对不对呢？这要看你这个台是否该搭，戏是否该唱。今明两年，我们要下大力气于整顿治理，如果大家都随意集资搭台，随意唱戏，台越搭越多，戏越唱越邪，总需求继续超过总供给，通货膨胀和物价得不到有效控制，这将怎么得了！
    置全局于不顾的“独辟蹊径，多方开拓”，是万万要不得的。
    集资，非不可为，而是不能乱来。集资，要有个章法，要有正确的导向。最近，有关部门对企业集资已作出若干规定，但愿这股热潮能降温，能纳入正规的轨道。
