The China International Rehabilitation Association was established in Hangzhou today. This marks the transition of China's rehabilitation medical field from a traditional, closed, and dispersed model to one of cooperation and collaboration, and towards an outward-looking development.

China is one of the earliest countries in the world to use traditional Chinese medicine, qigong, tuina, acupuncture, and other methods for rehabilitation treatment. The scope of rehabilitation has expanded to include medical rehabilitation, educational rehabilitation, vocational rehabilitation, and social rehabilitation. Medical rehabilitation has far exceeded the scope of health care. However, in the past, the hundreds of sanatoriums with advanced technology and facilities and pleasant environments had little contact with each other, and their resources and technological advantages could not be fully utilized and developed. With the development of the industry, it has become a necessity to carry out domestic and international exchanges and cooperation.

Gu Yīng Qí, Vice Minister of Health and an expert in rehabilitation medicine, serves as the honorary president of the association. It is reported that the association will accept a large number of overseas rehabilitation patients and promote the development of China's rehabilitation industry towards internationalization and modernization.

　　中国国际康复协会在杭州成立
    新华社杭州３月１１日电  （通讯员钱晓鸣、记者许群）由全国数百家疗养院组成的“中国国际康复协会”今天在杭州成立，标志我国康复医疗事业由传统的封闭分散的模式走向联合与协作，并向外向型发展。
    我国是世界上最早运用传统的中医中药、气功、推拿、针灸等手段进行康复医疗的国家，康复范围已扩大到医疗康复、教育康复、职业康复和社会康复四大领域。医疗康复也远远超出了保健医疗的范畴。但是，过去技术设施先进、环境优雅的数百家疗养院之间联系较少，资源和技术优势不能充分利用和发挥。随着事业的发展，开展国内外交流与协作，已成为必然趋势。
    卫生部副部长、康复医学专家顾英奇担任这个协会的名誉会长。据悉，协会将成批接纳海外康复者，并推动中国康复事业向国际化、现代化方向发展。
