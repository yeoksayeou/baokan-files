A multi-functional mobile rice hulling machine that can vary its speed, move forward and backward, and turn with differential speed, capable of performing multiple tasks such as rice hulling, crushing, and water pumping, has recently been successfully developed in Wanning County, Hainan Province.

Previously, separate machines were needed for rice hulling, crushing, and water pumping, and these activities are essential in rural areas, so each machine had to be purchased. These machines need to be stably installed for use, and moving them to a new location can be quite troublesome. Now, with this "multi-functional" and "easily movable" agricultural machine, costs can be further reduced, and agricultural production efficiency can be improved.

　　海南制成会“走”的碾米机
    本报讯  一种可变速行走、能进能退、差速转弯，可同时进行碾米、粉碎、抽水等多种作业的多功能走动式碾米机，最近在海南省万宁县研制成功。
    以往碾米、粉碎、抽水各有各的机种，而这几种农活儿一般农村必不可少，所以样样都得买。这些机器都需平稳地安装起来才好使用，若想挪个地方，颇为费事。现在有了这种“多功能”、“随便移动”的农机，可进一步降低成本，提高农业生产的效率。（王玄）
