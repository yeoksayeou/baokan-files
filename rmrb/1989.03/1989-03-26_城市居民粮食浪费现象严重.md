Recently, the urban survey team of Jinzhou City in Liaoning Province conducted a survey of 100 households in the city. The results show that many residents have a weakened sense of frugality with grain, leading to significant waste.

Among the 100 surveyed households, 20% had 240 kilograms of grain spoiled due to improper storage in 1988, with one household alone wasting 25 kilograms. 51% of the households frequently discarded leftover rice. According to the respondents, these households discarded at least 350 kilograms of grain in 1988. Calculating based on the 100 surveyed households, each household discarded an average of 5.9 kilograms of grain into the trash in 1988. Among the 100 surveyed households, 54 used grain coupons to exchange for eggs in 1988. The grain coupons used by residents to exchange for eggs ultimately ended up in the hands of "grain speculators" who then resold the state-subsidized grain at a profit. Based on this, it is estimated that in 1988, Jinzhou City alone lost over 2 million yuan in grain subsidies due to residents exchanging grain coupons for eggs.

The survey analysis indicates that the main reasons for the severe grain waste are:

	1. Households have excessive grain reserves
	This survey of 100 households found that by the end of 1988, each household had an average of 79.1 kilograms of grain, 112.2 kilograms of grain coupons, and 161.6 kilograms of remaining rations on their supply cards, totaling 352.9 kilograms. This amount is equivalent to more than half a year's ration for each household. Among these, 12 households had grain reserves exceeding their annual ration.

	2. Grain prices do not reflect their value
	Under the support of substantial state financial subsidies, the price of grain supplied to urban residents has not changed since 1967. The grain price is clearly detached from its actual value, leading some people to believe that "grain is not valuable" and thus not paying attention to saving grain.

	3. Insufficient propaganda and education on saving grain
	Among the 100 surveyed households, 92% did not know how much state financial subsidy is provided for each kilogram of supplied grain, and 86% believed that in recent years, relevant departments have conducted very little propaganda and education on cherishing and saving grain.

### 城市居民粮食浪费现象严重

　　城市居民粮食浪费现象严重
    最近，辽宁省锦州市城市调查队对本市百户居民家庭进行的调查结果表明，现今许多居民节约用粮观念淡化，粮食浪费惊人。
    在调查的百户居民中，１９８８年有２０％的家庭因保管不善造成变质而倒掉的粮食达２４０公斤，其中有１户多达２５公斤。有５１％的家庭经常倒掉剩饭。据被调查者估计，１９８８年这些家庭至少有３５０公斤粮食被倒掉。按调查的百户居民家庭计算，去年户均倒进垃圾箱的粮食就有５．９公斤。调查的百户居民家庭，去年用粮票换鸡蛋的有５４户。居民换鸡蛋的粮票，最终将流进“粮倒”手中而套购国家的平价粮。以此推算，１９８８年因居民用粮票换鸡蛋，锦州市区就有２００多万元的粮食财政补贴被悄悄地“换”掉。
    据调查分析，浪费粮食现象惊人的主要原因是：
    　　　　一、居民家庭口粮积存较多
    这次调查的百户居民家庭，１９８８年末户均拥有粮食７９．１公斤、粮票１１２．２公斤、供应口粮本上的定量积余１６１．６公斤，共为３５２．９公斤，这相当于户均半年多的口粮定量。其中有１２户积存的口粮数量比其全家一年的定量还多。
    　　　　二、粮价背离价值
    在国家巨额财政补贴支撑下，供应城镇居民定量口粮的价格自１９６７年以来从未变动，粮食价格明显背离价值，使一部分人产生了“粮食不值钱”的错觉，不注意节约用粮。
    　　　　三、对节约用粮的宣传教育不够
    在调查的百户居民中，有９２％的人不知道供应的口粮每公斤国家财政补贴多少钱，有８６％的人认为，近几年有关部门对珍惜粮食、节约用粮宣传教育很少。
