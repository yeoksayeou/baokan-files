A certain township enterprise was recruiting an accountant. A worker came to apply. During the interview, one candidate was sharp and articulate, answering questions fluently; the other was confused and incoherent. The difference in their performance was clear. However, the outcome was surprising: the confused candidate was hired, while the sharp candidate was not. A friend asked the reason, and the factory director said: "All the accounts are in my head. The accountant is just there to deal with the higher-ups. Have you heard of the saying 'It's rare to be foolish'? A foolish person keeps foolish accounts, and when the tax authorities come, they can't figure it out. It's not their fault, and we can handle things more conveniently with money."

　　难得糊涂
    某乡镇企业招聘一名会计。有工人前来应聘。厂长面试时，一位精明干练，对答如流；另一位糊里糊涂，语无伦次。相比优劣明显。然而结局却出人意料，糊涂者被录用，精明者落聘。有朋友问其故，厂长说：那点帐都在我肚里装着，会计不过是用来应付上边的。你们听人讲过难得糊涂吗？糊涂人记糊涂帐，税务局来了都查不清，不能者不怪，我们用钱办事可就方便多了。
