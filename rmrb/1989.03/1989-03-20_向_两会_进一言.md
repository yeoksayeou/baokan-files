Title: A Word to the "Two Sessions"

The annual "Two Sessions" have once again begun.

As a citizen, my attention to the "Two Sessions" has increased along with the reform and opening up, especially with the increasing transparency of the meetings. This reflects, to some extent, the development of socialist democracy in our country; for the individual, perhaps we can use a new term and call it "awakening of subject consciousness"!

Once the subject consciousness is awakened, it becomes hard to restrain oneself, always wanting to say something, even if one's words carry little weight, it is still a hope for the "Two Sessions."

Currently, the common people have many concerns: they worry about whether prices can stabilize, whether inflation can be curbed, whether the scale of construction projects can be reduced, whether social customs can improve, whether corruption can be eradicated, and whether a stable and united situation can be maintained. Above all, they are concerned about whether the central government truly understands the sentiments and hearts of the people. Some might say, "Why worry about this? The central government knows everything." If that is the case, then it is indeed a great fortune for the country. However, the concerns of the common people are not without reason. Their concerns reflect their hopes—that the central government will make decisions based on the sentiments and hearts of the people that are more in line with reality.

People's representatives and members of the Political Consultative Conference have conducted inspections and visited many places, gaining a fairly genuine understanding of the sentiments and hearts of the people. Attending this grand meeting, they should speak freely with the spirit of speaking without reservation and expressing without restraint, bringing the voices of the common people to the meeting. This is one of the hopes.

The People's Congress, as the highest organ of state power, is a meeting for deliberating on state affairs. The Political Consultative Conference, as a united front organization led by the Party, is a meeting for consultation. The People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference are not about setting up a "dragon gate array" or "chatting," where everyone expresses their grievances, feels satisfied, and then considers democracy to have been practiced and the meeting to have been successfully concluded. Deliberation must be conducted, and consultation must be carried out. Whether deliberating or consulting, the focus should be on several key topics and delve deeply into them. You talk about one thing, and I talk about another, although everyone expresses their own views, it may seem lively, but at most it can only be called "casual talk," and it is difficult to say it is high-level deliberation or consultation. Today, how to rectify and reform is a major issue that concerns the hearts of hundreds of millions of people. I hope the "Two Sessions" will delve deeply into and thoroughly discuss this topic. This is the second hope.

The third hope is to deliberate and decide, to consult and determine. This is also difficult. Nowadays, many issues are complex and interrelated, making it hard to "cut off and untangle." It is not easy to make decisions on many major issues within the short meeting period. But since the meeting is being held, some problems must be solved. This requires coming up with ideas, finding ways, pooling wisdom, and jointly seeking good strategies.

### 向“两会”进一言

　　向“两会”进一言
    于今健
    一年一度的“两会”又拉开了帷幕。
    作为一个公民，我对“两会”的关注，是随着改革、开放，特别是随着会议透明度的增加，而逐渐增多的。这从一个侧面说明了我国的社会主义民主建设有所发展；对个人来说，套用一句新词，或许就叫做“主体意识觉醒”吧！
    主体意识一觉醒，就有点按捺不住，总想说点什么，尽管人微言轻，也算是对“两会”的希望。
    现在老百姓关心的事情很多：关心物价能不能稳定，关心通货膨胀能不能遏制，关心基建规模能不能压下来，关心社会风气能不能好转，关心腐败现象能不能肃清，关心安定团结的局面能不能保持；而关心之最，莫过于中央是不是真正了解民情、民心。或许有人会说：“这还用你操心，中央什么不知道？”果如此，当然是国之大幸。不过，老百姓的关心也绝不是多余的。他们的关心表明他们的希望——希望中央根据民情、民心作出更切合实际的决策。
    人民代表和政协委员会前视察，都跑了不少地方，对民情、民心有相当真切的了解，躬逢盛会，本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神畅所欲言，把老百姓的呼声带到会上去，这是希望之一。
    人代会作为国家最高权力机关，是议政的会。政协会作为党所领导的统一战线组织，是协商的会。议政会、政协会，不是摆“龙门阵”、“侃大山”，不是各人发一通牢骚，痛快痛快，就算发扬了民主，就能胜利闭幕的。议政要议，协商要商。议也罢，商也罢，都要围绕着若干个议题深入展开。你说东，他说西，虽然也各抒己见，看起来热闹，最多只能算“漫谈”，很难说是高水平的议政、协商。当今，如何治理整顿，深化改革，是牵动亿万人心的大事，愿“两会”在这个议题上议深商透，这是希望之二。
    第三点希望是议而有决，商而有定。这也难。现在的事情大都头绪繁多，互相牵制，“剪不断，理还乱”，要在短短的会期间，就许多重大问题作出决定，不那么容易。但既然开会，总要解决一点问题，这就需要出主意，想办法，集思广益，共谋良策。
