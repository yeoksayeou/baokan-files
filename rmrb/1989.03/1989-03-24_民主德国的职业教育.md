The vocational education system in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) is built upon a 10-year compulsory education system. All young people have the right and obligation to attend 10-year comprehensive technical schools. Students begin learning basic skills and undergo internships in enterprises, laying a foundation for future vocational training.

Upon graduating from the 10-year schools, some students proceed to advanced high schools for two years of study, followed by a year of practical training, which qualifies them for university admission. Others enter specialized schools for three years of study, after which they can either start working or pursue higher education. The majority of 10-year school graduates enter various vocational schools. These vocational schools are of two types: a minority are three-year programs, after which graduates receive certificates and are qualified for university admission or can become skilled workers. The majority are two-year programs, after which graduates enter the workforce or can proceed to specialized schools.

Currently, the GDR has 955 vocational schools with a total of 392,000 students this academic year, including 175,000 new students enrolled in 1988. The state provides students with a small monthly stipend. Most vocational schools are run by enterprises, and students sign contracts with these enterprises before graduation, ensuring employment upon completion. A small number are public vocational schools run by local governments, specifically for small enterprises that cannot afford to run their own training programs.

The content of vocational education includes both theoretical and practical components. Theoretical courses cover various professional knowledge areas such as production economics and automation basics. Practical courses are divided into basic and specialized training. Basic practical courses cover essential skills required for the chosen profession, with dedicated classrooms, workshops, laboratories, and various training equipment. Specialized practical courses focus on the specific knowledge and skills needed for actual production processes, including training for future job roles under complete production conditions. In terms of time allocation, the ratio of theoretical to practical training is approximately 3:7, and the ratio of basic to specialized practical training is 1:1.

To adapt to the transition of the national economy towards comprehensive intensification, the GDR has formulated a new vocational education curriculum, which is to be implemented between 1986 and 1990.

Currently, there are 300 different professions available in various vocational schools across the GDR, and students choose their profession before graduation. Vocational counseling centers have been established nationwide, both in urban and rural areas, ensuring that 85% of young people's first career choices are met.

The high vocational skills of the workforce, universally trained through good vocational education, have become a favorable condition for the development of GDR society and the national economy.

　　民主德国的职业教育
    本报记者  许宏治
    民德的职业教育建立在１０年制义务教育基础之上。所有青少年都有权利和义务上１０年制综合技术学校。学生开始学习基础技能，并到企业实习，为将来进职业学校打下一定基础。
    １０年制学校的毕业生一部分进高级中学学习两年，毕业后经一年实践锻炼，即取得上大学的资格，另一部分进专科学校学习三年，毕业后即可参加工作，也有机会上大学。绝大部分１０年制学校毕业生进各种职业学校学习。职业学校分为两种，少数是三年制，毕业后取得证书，也就取得了上大学的资格，不上大学者便成为技术工人。大部分职业学校是两年制，学生毕业后即参加工作，也可进专科学校。
    目前，民德全国共有９５５所职业学校，本学年在校学生共３９．２万人，其中１９８８年入学新生为１７．５万。国家每月发给学生少量津贴。职业学校大部分由企业主办，学生毕业前与企业签订合同，毕业后即可在本企业就业。小部分是地方政府主办的公共职业学校，专为无力办学的小企业培养职工。
    职业教育内容包括理论和实践两大部分。理论课讲授各种职业需要的理论知识，如生产经济学、自动化基础等。实践课又分为基础实践和专业实践。
    基础实践课包括所选职业必需的基础技能，有专门的课室、实习工场、实验室和各种操作练习设备供学生使用。专业实践课学习实际生产过程中所需的专门知识和技能，包括有目的地培养在成套生产条件下及未来具体工作岗位上所需的专门技能。在时间分配上，理论与实践之比约为３∶７，基础实践与专业实践之比为１∶１。
    为了适应国民经济向全面集约化过渡的新形势，民主德国制定了新的职业教育纲领，要求在１９８６—１９９０年期间得到贯彻。
    目前，民德各类职业学校共有３００种职业可供选择，学生在毕业前即已选定职业。全国城乡成立了职业咨询中心，通过咨询中心的工作，８５％年青人的第一志愿可得到满足。
    劳动者职业素质好，普遍受过良好的职业教育，已成为民主德国社会和国民经济发展的有利条件之一。
