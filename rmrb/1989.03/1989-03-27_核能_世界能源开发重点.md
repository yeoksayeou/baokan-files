Nuclear Power - A Key Focus in Global Energy Development

Three years ago, a serious accident occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in the Soviet Union, which shocked the world and left a lasting shadow on people's minds. However, the global utilization of nuclear energy has not stagnated as a result; instead, it continues to develop and has the potential to become the primary energy source of the next century.

Nuclear Power Generation is Thriving

Since the world's first nuclear power plant began operation in the Soviet Union in 1954, nuclear power plant technology has become increasingly mature, safe to operate, and economically viable. Therefore, countries around the world are competing to develop nuclear power industries. After 1966, the installed capacity of nuclear power plants worldwide increased at an average annual rate of 25.5%. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, in 1987, 21 new nuclear power reactors were put into operation, and construction began on 9 reactors in Bulgaria, Japan, China, and India. In 1988, another 12 nuclear power plants were put into use, bringing the total number of nuclear reactors used for power generation worldwide to 428, with a total generating capacity of 309,383 megawatts, accounting for more than 16% of the world's total electricity generation. Currently, the United States has the most nuclear power plants, with 110 in operation. France's nuclear power generation accounts for 70% of its total electricity generation, the highest in the world. The global nuclear power industry is maintaining a sustained development momentum.

The Appeal of Nuclear Power Plants

The Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident was caused by multiple factors, and strict safety measures in management and technology could have prevented the accident. Recently, Chernobyl's plant director, Umanets, said that current technology can prevent a recurrence of the accident.

Nuclear power generation has high energy output, high utilization efficiency, and good economic benefits. Although the construction investment for nuclear power plants is relatively high compared to thermal power plants, the fuel costs are low, making the operating costs of the two comparable. If the cost per kilowatt-hour is calculated, the cost of nuclear power generation is 20% to 50% lower than that of thermal power plants. The transportation of nuclear fuel is much more convenient than that of coal, which can significantly reduce the pressure on transportation. Nuclear power plants can also produce radioactive isotopes for use in industrial and agricultural production and scientific research. Moreover, the development of nuclear energy can reduce environmental pollution. Recent calculations by meteorologists indicate that if coal were to remain the primary energy source, the increase in carbon dioxide would lead to a rise in average temperatures, resulting in a series of disastrous consequences. If the world transitions to nuclear energy as the primary energy source by 2040, global temperatures will gradually decrease, improving the human living environment. Therefore, many countries, with a strategic perspective, attach great importance to the development of the nuclear power industry.

The Primary Energy Source of the Next Century

The nuclear power plants currently in operation worldwide use uranium-235 or plutonium-239, isotopes that are easily fissionable, to release enormous energy through nuclear fission reactions. Developed countries are currently developing new generations of light water reactors, fast breeder reactors, and other types of nuclear reactors. Scientists predict that the nuclear power industry will enter a new phase of development.

It is predicted that by the year 2000, the installed capacity of nuclear power plants worldwide will increase by approximately one-third compared to 1988, and the proportion of nuclear power in total electricity generation will rise to 20-30%. During this period, the world's energy structure will change. For example, by the end of this century, Japan's demand for oil will significantly decrease, while the demand for nuclear energy will increase, and the installed capacity of nuclear power plants will be more than double that of 1986. The nuclear power generation capacity of OECD countries and Asia will at least double.

Furthermore, by 2050, the world's population may reach 10 billion, leading to a significant increase in energy demand. However, the reserves of oil and natural gas will be depleted, and coal supply will decrease, with greater calls for environmental improvement. In this context, people will inevitably pay more attention to the development and utilization of nuclear energy, which has minimal pollution and enormous potential. Hans Blix, the Director-General of the United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency, believes that the prospects for nuclear energy development are very promising. "Nuclear energy serves today and will also be deeply integrated into future life."

Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research Becomes a Hot Spot

Currently, developed countries are researching controlled nuclear fusion technology. The vast ocean is a treasure trove of nuclear fusion energy. If all the deuterium in seawater is used for nuclear fusion, the energy produced would be sufficient for human use for hundreds of billions of years. Therefore, nuclear fusion energy is hailed as the "sun" on Earth. For this reason, developed countries are competing to research nuclear fusion at great expense, as whoever succeeds first will occupy the "high ground" in nuclear energy utilization.

Significant progress has been made in nuclear fusion research, but it requires enormous research funds and international cooperation to overcome challenges. The United States, the Soviet Union, the European Community, and Japan have begun collaborating on controlled nuclear fusion research, designing the "International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor." Some experts estimate that this reactor could be operational by the early 21st century. Once the nuclear fusion reactor research is successful and put into normal operation, it means that humans have created a "sun" on Earth—a source of energy that is inexhaustible and limitless, thus opening up a fundamental solution to the energy problem.

　　核能——世界能源开发重点
    ３年前，苏联切尔诺贝利核电站发生严重事故，震动了世界，在人们的心头留下了阴影。但是，世界核能利用并没有因此而停滞不前，它继续发展，有可能成为下个世纪的主要能源。
    　　　　核能发电方兴未艾
    自１９５４年世界第一座核电站在苏联运行以来，核电站技术日趋成熟、运行安全、经济实用，所以各国竞相发展核电工业。１９６６年后世界核电站装机容量以年平均２５．５％的速度递增。据国际原子能机构统计，１９８７年，有２１座新的发电核反应堆投入运转，保加利亚、日本、中国和印度的９座反应堆开始动工建设；１９８８年又有１２座核电站投入使用，从而使世界用于发电的核反应堆总数增加到４２８座，总发电能力达到３０９３８３兆瓦，核发电量占世界总发电量的１６％以上。目前，世界上核电站最多的国家是美国，有１１０座核电站在运转；法国核电站发电量在其总发电量中的比例高达７０％，为世界之首。世界核电工业保持着持续发展的势头。
    　　　　核电站的魅力
    切尔诺贝利核电站事故是多方面的原因造成的，如果从管理和技术上采取严格的安全措施，事故是可以避免的。切尔诺贝利核电站站长乌马涅茨不久前说，现在的技术能够防止事故重演。
    核能发电能量大，利用率高，经济效益好。与火电站相比，核电站虽然建设投资较大，但燃料费用低，两者的运行费用不相上下。如果折算每度电的成本，核能发电成本低于火电厂２０％至５０％。核电燃料的运输远比运输煤炭方便，这能大大减轻对交通运输的压力。核电站还可以生产放射性同位素，供工农业生产和科研使用。特别是，核能发展可以减轻环境污染。气象学家最近的计算表明，如果世界上以煤为主要能源，则会因二氧化碳的增加引起平均气温升高，带来一系列灾难性后果；如果２０４０年后世界能源过渡到以核能为主，世界气温将逐渐回复下降，改善人类的生存环境。所以，许多国家从战略上着眼，重视发展核电工业。
    　　　　下世纪的主要能源
    今天世界上正在运转的核电站都是利用铀２３５或钚２３９等容易裂变的同位素，通过核裂变反应释放出巨大能量。发达国家目前正在进行新一代轻水堆、快中子增殖堆等不同型核堆的开发。科学家预计，核能工业将进入一个新的发展时期。
    据预测，到２０００年，世界核电站的装机容量将比１９８８年增加约１／３；核电占总发电量的比重将上升到２０—３０％。这期间，世界能源结构将发生变化。例如，到本世纪末，日本石油需求将大幅下降，而核能需求上升，核电站的装机容量相当于１９８６年的两倍多；经合组织国家和亚洲的核发电能力至少翻一番。
    另外，到２０５０年，世界人口可能达到１００亿，对能源的需求将大幅度增加，而石油、天然气的储量枯竭，煤炭供应减少，改善环境呼声更高，在这种情况下，人们势必更加重视开发和利用这个污染少又有巨大潜力的核能。联合国国际原子能机构总干事汉斯·布利克斯认为，核能的发展前景是非常令人乐观的，“核能服务于今天，也将深入到未来的生活中去”。
    　　　　核聚变研究正成为热点
    眼下，发达国家正在研究受控核聚变技术。浩瀚的海洋是核聚变反应的能源宝库，如果把海水中的全部氘用来进行核聚变，产生的能源足够供人类使用几百亿年。所以，核聚变能被誉为地球上的“太阳”。为此，发达国家不惜代价竞相研究核聚变，因为，谁能率先取得成功，谁就将占领核能利用的“制高点”。
    核聚变研究已取得重要进展，但它需要巨额的研究资金，需要各国联合攻坚。美国、苏联、欧共体和日本已开始合作从事受控核聚变的研究，设计“国际热核试验反应堆”。有的专家估计，这种反应堆可望下世纪初投入运转。一旦核聚变反应堆研究成功并转入正常运行，这意味着人类在地球上创造了一个“太阳”——取之不尽、用之不竭的能源，从而开辟了解决能源问题的根本途径。
