Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 8th.

The reorganization of the CPSU apparatus has been completed. The number of staff in the central apparatus has been reduced by 40%.

The chairman of the CPSU Central Committee's Commission on Party Building and Personnel Policy, Razumovsky, said in the 4th issue of the bi-weekly "Communist" that the work of reorganizing the party apparatus at all levels in the Soviet Union has basically been completed. From the center to the localities, the party apparatus has been greatly simplified, and the number of staff has been reduced.

This candidate member of the CPSU Central Committee Political Bureau and Central Committee Secretary pointed out that the reorganization of the party apparatus is the beginning of political reform in the Soviet Union. From the central committees of the union republics to the district party committees, the so-called "departmental departments" responsible for specific economic and social work have been abolished. The number of departments in party committees at all levels has been reduced by 1,064, or 44%, and the number of bureaus has been reduced by 465, nearly 1/4. The apparatus of city and district party committees generally only retains the organizational department and the ideological department.

Razumovsky said that the number of staff in the CPSU Central Committee apparatus has been reduced by 40%, the number of staff in the central committees of the union republics and the provincial committees has been reduced by 30%, and the number of staff in the city committees has been reduced by 10% to 20%. The number of secretaries in party committees at all levels has also been reduced. The staff who have been laid off are sent to grassroots party organizations, soviets, or economic departments, and some are retired.

He also revealed that the CPSU Central Committee's Commission on Party Building and Personnel Policy is preparing for the 28th CPSU Congress, putting forward suggestions on the issues of party building that the congress will discuss, and giving concluding opinions on the party documents that will be submitted to the entire party or the entire people for discussion.

　　苏共机关改组工作结束
    中央机关干部削减４０％
    新华社莫斯科３月８日电  苏共中央党的建设和干部政策委员会主席拉祖莫夫斯基在《共产党人》双旬刊第４期发表谈话说，苏联改组党的各级机关的工作已基本结束，从中央到地方，党的机关大大简化，机关干部人数减少。
    这位苏共中央政治局候补委员、中央书记指出，改组党的机关是苏联政治改革的开始。从加盟共和国党中央到区党委，负责具体经济和社会工作的所谓“部门部”都已撤销，各级党委的部共减少１０６４个，即４４％，局减少４６５个，近１／４。市和区的党委机关一般只剩下组织部和意识形态部。
    拉祖莫夫斯基说，苏共中央机关干部削减４０％，加盟共和国中央和州委机关干部减少３０％，市委机关干部减少１０％至２０％。各级党委书记人数也减少。裁减下来的机关干部分别到基层党组织、苏维埃或经济部门工作，有的则退休。
    他还透露，苏共中央党的建设和干部政策委员会正为苏共２８大作准备，就大会将讨论的党的建设问题提出建议，对即将提交全党或全民讨论的党的文件提出结论性意见。
