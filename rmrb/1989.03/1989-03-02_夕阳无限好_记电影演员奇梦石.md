When television series like "Family Education" and "Mr. Shen" appeared on screen, the name Qi Mengshi immediately entered every household.

Old Qi is 65 years old this year. He is tall and thin, speaks slowly, and has the demeanor of a scholar. He is currently filming the television series "Shanghai Morning" at Shanghai Television Station, playing the role of the capitalist Mei Zuoxian, dressed in a long robe, leisurely pacing in a French-style garden villa.

At the age of sixty, Qi Mengshi has entered his golden age of film and television performances. He has starred in more than ten films and television series, including "A Journey Through the Dust," "Under the Bridge," "The Shanghai Kidnapping Case," "Deep Emotions in the Small Tower," and "Legendary Lady," becoming a "late bloomer" star. In recent years, he has been constantly on the move, always busy. He will soon play the role of Marshal Bi Gan in the television series "Investiture of the Gods."

Calculating carefully, Qi Mengshi can be considered a veteran of China's film industry. He was active in the Shanghai film scene in the 1940s with Zhao Dan, Huang Zongying, Zhong Shuang, Gao Zheng, and others. In 1956, after filming Xie Jin's "Spring in the Water Town," he disappeared from the screen. When he resumed filming in the 1980s, his head was already covered with snow. Therefore, he felt deeply moved, as if he had experienced a dream.

While filming "Family Education," it was the height of summer, and the temperature in the studio reached over 40 degrees Celsius. But as the male lead, he couldn't leave the set for a moment and had to wear thick sweaters all day. Due to overwork, Qi Mengshi suffered from multiple gastric spasms, rolling in pain on the bed. The doctor advised him to be hospitalized, otherwise, his life might be in danger. Qi Mengshi asked, "Can I die within 4 months?" The doctor laughed and said, "Of course not." "Good, after 4 months, I will finish filming 'Family Education' and then come to treat the disease." After saying this, he returned to the set without hesitation...

Yes, in the past, he was helpless and wasted 25 precious years in vain. Perhaps because he had experienced many hardships, he had an exceptionally true and deep understanding and experience of society and life. Once his artistic life was restored, he would cherish it all the more.

    夕阳无限好
    ——记电影演员奇梦石
    俞亮鑫
    当电视连续剧《家教》、《密司脱沈》等相继在荧屏上出现时，奇梦石的名字随即走进千家万户。
    老奇今年65岁。瘦高个儿，说话慢条斯理，颇有学者风度。他正在上海电视台拍摄的电视连续剧《上海的早晨》中扮演资本家梅佐贤，着一袭长衫，在法国式的花园别墅中悠闲地踱着方步。
    年届花甲，奇梦石才进入了他影视表演的黄金时期，先后在《一路风尘》、《大桥下面》、《上海滩绑票奇案》、《小楼情深》、《传奇夫人》等十多部影视片中担任主角，成了一位“老来红”影星。这几年，他一直东奔西走，忙个不停。最近将在电视连续剧《封神演义》中扮演丞相比干。
    细细算来，奇梦石够得上我国电影界的一位老前辈了。他与赵丹、黄宗英、中叔皇、高正等同辈，四十年代就活跃在上海影坛。1956年，当他拍完谢晋执导的《水乡的春天》后，就一下子从银幕上消失了。八十年代重新拍片时，头顶已堆满积雪。所以他感慨万千，好像做了一场梦。
    在拍《家教》时，正值盛夏，摄影棚内气温高达40多度。但他是男主角，一刻也不能离开现场，还得整日穿着厚厚的毛衣外套。由于过度劳累，奇梦石的多发性胃痉挛发作了，痛得在床上直打滚。医生劝他住院，否则可能危及生命。奇梦石问道：“4个月内死得了吗？”医生笑着说：“当然不会。”“那好，4个月后，我拍完《家教》再来治病。”说完便毫不犹豫地回到了剧组……
    是的，过去他身不由己，徒然浪费了25年宝贵的光阴。也许由于历遭劫难，对社会、人生有着异常真切的体验和感受，一旦恢复了艺术生命，便会格外珍惜。
