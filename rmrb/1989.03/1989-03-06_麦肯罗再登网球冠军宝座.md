	McEnroe Regains the World Tennis Championship
	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 4

	The arrogant McEnroe, after three and a half years of hard work, finally returned to the world tennis championship throne he had long been away from. He also set a record of being the first person to win the world tennis championship five times.

	Today, the American tennis star McEnroe defeated the world's 16th ranked player, American Gilbert, in Dallas. The scores for the three sets were 6-3, 6-3, and 7-6.

	McEnroe had been away from this championship for nine long years. Today's victory is also his first world championship title in three and a half years.

	On March 3, McEnroe defeated the world's top-ranked player, Czechoslovakia's Ivan Lendl, with a score of 3-1, paving the way to victory.

	Since Lendl defeated McEnroe in the 1985 U.S. Open, pushing him off the world championship throne, McEnroe, who had previously relied on his talent to play, had been on a downward spiral and had not won any world championships since then. Now, he is ranked sixth in the world.

　　麦肯罗再登网球冠军宝座
    新华社华盛顿３月４日电  恃才自傲的麦肯罗卧薪尝胆３年多，终于重返无缘已久的世界网球冠军宝座。并创下一人五次获得世界网球锦标赛冠军的纪录。
    美国网球明星麦肯罗今天在道拉斯战胜世界１６号选手、美国的吉尔伯特。３局的比分是６∶３，６∶３和７∶６。
    麦肯罗阔别这项比赛冠军已长达９年之久。今天的胜利，也是麦肯罗３年多来第一次获得世界冠军。
    ３日，麦肯罗以３∶１击败世界头号选手、捷克斯洛伐克的伊凡·伦德尔，打开了通向胜利的道路。
    自从１９８５年美国网球公开赛上，伦德尔把麦肯罗赶下世界冠军宝座后，过去一直凭才华打球的麦肯罗就每况愈下，再未问津过世界冠军。现在，他排名世界第六。
