Rural Teachers Face Heavy Burdens and Worrying Health Conditions

Recently, we conducted a survey of 1,619 teachers from 10 rural primary and secondary schools in Nan County, Hunan Province. The average age of these teachers is 38 years, and 474 of them suffer from various chronic diseases, accounting for 29.3%. These individuals, though not old, have nearly one-third suffering from chronic diseases. What is the reason behind this?

According to the survey, the heavy teaching workload and mental stress are significant factors. Rural schools have tight course schedules, with each teacher typically teaching 20-25 classes per week. In addition to regular teaching tasks, they also need to handle the ideological work of underperforming students, resolve conflicts among students, and provide remedial classes for students with poor grades. On average, they work 11 hours a day, especially class teachers who have an even heavier workload. This overloaded operation keeps them in a state of continuous mental tension, leading to a decline in physical fitness and the onset or worsening of some chronic diseases.

Secondly, living conditions and environmental hygiene have long been neglected. Teachers in these schools generally live in soundproof rooms between classrooms, which are old, damp, and cramped. One teacher's family of four lives in a soundproof room of about 16 square meters, with only enough space for two beds and cooking utensils. Some houses are so dilapidated that they are uninhabitable.

Thirdly, economic conditions are poor, and household chores are heavy. Currently, rural teachers' actual income is lower than that of other professions, especially those with family members consuming rural grain, known as "half-households." Their monthly salary can barely meet basic needs, and if they have children studying elsewhere, the situation becomes even more difficult. These half-household teachers usually also participate in various self-study exams organized by higher education institutions. Upon returning home, they are the primary labor force, and both paddy fields and dry land require their attention, further deteriorating their health.

Fourthly, medical conditions are poor, and funds are limited, making it difficult for teachers to receive timely diagnosis and treatment. Some rural primary schools are located in remote areas, far from township health centers. These teachers often endure minor illnesses and continue teaching. Even if they visit the township health center, the poor medical conditions and lack of experienced medical personnel make it difficult for rural teachers to receive early and accurate diagnoses and active treatment.

Fifthly, the scope of activities is narrow, and cultural facilities are poor. Rural teachers lead monotonous lives, with few cultural activities throughout the year. In the evenings, most of the time there is no electricity, and even if there is a black-and-white television, it remains unused in the dark. This isolated and lonely environment often makes rural teachers feel melancholic and develop a desire to leave.

The health condition of rural teachers should be highly valued by the whole society. We suggest:

1. Reform teaching methods and establish a system where college graduates first work in rural areas to reduce the teaching workload and mental stress of rural teachers.
2. The county education and health departments should lead an annual comprehensive health check-up for rural teachers at county-level hospitals. The education department should establish a special health management file, keeping track of each rural teacher's health status. Implement preferential policies for rural teachers' medical and medication expenses.
3. Strive to solve the practical difficulties faced by rural teachers, such as water, accommodation, and children's employment.
4. Strengthen the construction of cultural facilities in rural schools.

### 农村教师负担过重  健康状况令人担忧

　　农村教师负担过重  健康状况令人担忧
    最近，我们调查了湖南省南县１０所农村中小学校的１６１９名教师，他们平均年龄３８岁，患各种慢性疾病者４７４人，占２９.３％。这些人年龄不大，患慢性疾病的却近１／３，是什么原因呢？
    据调查，教学任务大，精神负担重是一个原因。农村学校课程安排紧，一名教师一般每周２０—２５节课，每天除了正常的教学任务外，还要做后进学生的思想工作，解决学生之间的矛盾，给成绩差的学生补课，平均每天要工作１１个小时，尤其是班主任老师，工作量更大。这种超负荷的运转，使他们思想上处于持续紧张状态，造成身体素质下降，引起一些慢性疾病的发生或加重。
    二是住房条件、环境卫生长期得不到改善。这部分学校的教师一般都是住在教室与教室之间的隔音室里，房屋破旧，地面潮湿，面积狭小。有位教师全家４口人，拥挤在一间约１６平方米的隔音室里，除了放两张床外，剩余面积就只能放炊具了。有些房子破烂漏雨无法居住。
    三是经济条件差，家务负担重。目前农村教师的实际收入比其他行业的要少，尤其是那些家属吃农村粮的“半家户”，一月的工资只能勉强维持温饱，一旦有孩子在外地读书，就更困难了。这些半家户教师一般还要参加高等院校举办的各种自学考试，回家后又是主要劳动力，水田、旱土都离不开他们，使他们的健康水平日趋下降。
    四是医疗条件差、经费少，患病难以及时诊断治疗。部分农村小学处在偏僻地区，离乡卫生院较远。这些教师患点小病就硬撑着坚持上课。即使到了乡卫生院就诊，由于目前乡卫生院的医疗条件差，经验丰富的医疗技术人员少，又使得农村教师患病难以早期准确的诊断和积极的治疗。
    五是活动范围狭窄，文化设施差。农村教师生活单调，一年难得有几次文化活动，晚上大部时间没有电，就是有部黑白电视机也只能让它在黑暗中睡觉。这种冷落、孤僻的环境常使农村教师心情忧郁，产生思迁情绪。
    农村教师的健康状况应得到全社会的高度重视。我们建议：
    １、改革教学方法，建立大中专学生首先到基层工作的制度，减轻农村教师的教学任务和精神负担。２、应由县教育、卫生主管部门牵头，每年组织农村教师到县级医院进行一次全面的健康检查。教育主管部门应建立专门的健康管理档案，对每个农村教师的健康状况做到心中有数。对农村教师医疗、药费实行优惠政策。３、尽力解决农村教师的实际困难，如饮水、住宿、子女就业等等。４、加强农村学校文化设施建设。湖南　段工
