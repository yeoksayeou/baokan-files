If one knows why the mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang was buried with the world-famous terracotta warriors, a visit to the rarely seen horse sacrifice pits of the ruins of the capital of Qi might provide some insight.

The ruins of the capital of Qi are located within the jurisdiction of Linzi District, Zibo City, Shandong Province. The most fascinating part of the ruins is the horse sacrifice pits next to the tomb of the 25th king of Qi, Duke Jing of Qi. This pit surrounds the tomb from the east, west, and north, with a total length of 215 meters, a width of 5 meters, and a depth of over two meters below the surface. A total of 228 horse skeletons have been excavated, and it is estimated that there were over 600 horses in total. The excavated horse skeletons are arranged in two rows in the pit, with the five horses at the front having copper bells around their necks, displaying a majestic and ready-for-battle posture.

Experts have verified that during Duke Jing of Qi's reign, he had a great love for warhorses and often displayed his country's strength through the number of warhorses he possessed. According to the identification of the horse skeletons, these horses were all castrated warhorses and were intoxicated with wine before being sacrificed.

Some experts believe that the terracotta warriors buried in the mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang in Lintong, Shaanxi Province, may have been influenced by the noble customs of Qi, evolving from the use of real horses to the use of terracotta warriors as sacrificial artifacts.

　　秦始皇陵为何随葬兵马俑
    齐国故城殉马坑给人启示
    新华社济南电  （记者路云）若知秦始皇陵墓为何随葬举世闻名的兵马俑？参观过我国历史上罕见的齐国故城遗址大型殉马坑后，或许能得到启示。
    齐国故城遗址，位于山东省淄博市临淄区境内。遗址最使人们感兴趣的是，齐国第２５代国君齐景公坟墓旁边的殉马坑。这个殉马坑从东西北三面围绕齐景公的墓穴，探明总长２１５米，宽５米，离地面两米多深。已挖掘出殉马遗骨２２８匹。据推算，全部殉马有６００多匹。被挖掘出来的殉马遗骨，在坑内排列两行，最前面的５匹，颈系铜铃，呈临战前的待命威武姿态。
    经专家论证，齐景公在位期间，颇喜爱战马，并以战马数量之多显示国力。据对殉马遗骨鉴定，这批殉马都是被骟的战马，是在殉葬前用药酒灌醉的。
    有的专家认为，在陕西省临潼秦始皇陵墓随葬兵马俑，很可能是秦王朝受齐国贵族习俗的影响，而演变成以艺术品的兵马俑代替真马来殉葬。
