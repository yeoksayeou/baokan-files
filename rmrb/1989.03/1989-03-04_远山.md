		Distant Mountains
		Xuě Yíng

		Ten years like a dream
		You have become a landscape
			so deep and so distant
		Since my little heart became
			a wanderer's slave
		I have given my fate to the
			uncertain winds
		I dared not hope to see you again
		I never imagined that our reunion would be
			in the distant borderlands
		It was such a casual glance
		But you, in the setting sun's dreamlike figure
		In an instant, bloomed countless flowers of memory
		A seed called homesickness
		Bursts forth painfully in the frozen soil
		I wish I could go back
		To be once again the girl with the bamboo basket
		But the river has long since dried up
		The crisscrossing roads block my path
		For many years
		Who will pick the mushrooms that bloom like stars and umbrellas
			after the rain?

专栏：

　　远山
    雪莹
    十年一梦
    你已成为很深很远
    　的风景
    自从小小的心儿做
    　了浪人的奴隶
    便把命运交给了无
    　定的风云
    不敢奢望能再相见
    不曾想到重逢是在迢遥的塞外
    那是怎样不经意的一瞥呵
    你却以斜阳下梦幻般的身影
    瞬息间催开了无数记忆的花朵
    有颗名叫乡思的种子
    在冻土下痛楚地爆芽
    多想走回去
    重做一次挎竹筐的女孩
    可那河流早已干涸
    网状的道路阻挡着我的脚步
    许多年了
    那些雨后如星如伞的蘑菇
    谁去采摘呢？
