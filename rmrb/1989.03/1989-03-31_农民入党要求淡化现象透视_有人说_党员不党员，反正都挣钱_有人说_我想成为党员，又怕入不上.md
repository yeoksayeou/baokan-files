A recent survey conducted by relevant departments in Fangzhou Administrative Village, Huan County, Anhui Province, revealed the following about the state of party members in the village's party branch. The branch has 4 party cells and 24 party members, accounting for 1.72% of the total village population. Among the party members, 54.2% are illiterate, and the majority joined the party in the 1960s, with 58.3% being over 50 years old. Given this situation, cultivating and recruiting young farmers with education to join the party is an urgent task for strengthening the branch. However, there are few people with the desire to join the party, making it difficult to recruit new members. Why has the enthusiasm for joining the party among farmers diminished? The survey in the village shows:

The standards for evaluating people have changed. Many villagers believe that "whether you are a party member or not, you still make money," and becoming a party member means you have to lead in everything! Village cadres say: In the past, people looked up to party members, but now they only look up to those who are wealthy; in the past, farmers evaluated people mainly based on politics, but now they focus more on economics and practical benefits.

The purpose of joining the party is misunderstood. Most of the surveyed villagers do not clearly understand the purpose of joining the party. Many villagers say: Without education, what use is joining the party? You can't even become a cadre. This reflects that many people mistakenly believe that the purpose of joining the party is to become a cadre and have personal prospects. Most educated villagers understand the concept of a party member but do not apply for membership due to other reasons.

Fear of losing face. Many villagers say: I admire the party and want to become a party member, but I am afraid of not being accepted and being laughed at. Among the 5 people who have applied to join the party, almost all of them delayed submitting their applications for this reason. At the same time, these party applicants are mostly grassroots cadres who only gradually overcame their hesitations due to work needs.

The authority of party members among the masses has declined. The main focus of the village party branch is on various administrative tasks. Due to tasks such as grain collection, fee collection, and family planning, which sometimes hurt the feelings of the villagers, the relationship between cadres and the masses is tense. Additionally, party organization activities are not normal, and the quality of party members is poor. Some party members engage in gambling and violate family planning regulations; some party members do not set an example by paying agricultural taxes and public grain; among party members, there is a significant problem with favoritism and extravagant banquets. All these phenomena are seen by the villagers, damaging the party's authority to varying degrees.

　　农民入党要求淡化现象透视        
    有人说“党员不党员，反正都挣钱”        
    有人说“我想成为党员，又怕入不上”
    前一段时间，有关部门在安徽省含山县房圩行政村党支部对党员的状况作过一次调查。这个支部有４个党小组、２４名党员，占该村全村人口总数的１．７２％；党员中文盲占党员数的５４．２％；党员中绝大多数是６０年代入党，５０岁以上的占５８．３％。鉴于这种状况，培养吸收有文化的农村青年入党，是加强支部建设的当务之急。但是，有入党要求的人太少，发展党员工作困难。为什么会出现农民入党要求淡化现象呢？该村的调查情况表明：
    衡量人的标准发生变化。不少群众认为“党员不党员，反正都挣钱”，争个党员还要事事带头呢！村干部说：过去群众对党员高看一眼，现在群众只对致富的人高看一眼；过去农民群众衡量人的标准多从政治着眼，而现在更多的转向了经济，图实惠。
    对入党目的理解模糊。被调查的大部分群众，对入党究竟是为了干什么并不清楚。不少群众说：没有文化入党有什么用，又没有能力当干部。这反映不少人把入党的目的错误地认为是当干部，有个人前途。有文化的群众多数理解党员的概念，只是出于其它原因而不提出申请。
    怕面子上不好看。许多群众说：我也敬仰党，想成为一名党员，但又怕申请入不上，让人笑话。在已经申请入党的５人中，几乎都是出于这个原因而推迟递交入党申请。同时，这几个要求入党的同志多数是基层干部，只是考虑到工作需要，才逐渐打消了顾虑。
    党员在群众中威信下降。该村党支部的主要精力用到各种事务性工作上，由于催粮、收钱和搞计划生育有时伤害了群众感情，干群关系紧张。同时，党组织活动不正常，党员素质差。有少数党员参与赌博，违反计划生育规定；少数党员不起先锋模范作用，不带头交公粮、交农业税；党员中少数人的人情风、吃喝风比较严重。所有这些现象群众看在眼里，对党的威信有不同程度的损害。
