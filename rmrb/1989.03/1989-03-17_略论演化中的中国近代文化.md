The West refers to Chinese culture as Sinology, Sinica, or Han studies, and sometimes as Oriental studies. Oriental studies primarily focus on China, including India and Japan, and have a broader scope than Sinology. The Western concept of Sinology generally refers to ancient Chinese culture. They view China through three lenses: vast territory, large population, and a long cultural history. A long cultural history refers to the splendid ancient Chinese culture. In their eyes, China has no modern culture. Until 1979, when Comrade Deng Xiaoping visited the United States, President Carter still said in his welcome speech: "China is one of the countries with the oldest culture of over five thousand years, but as a modern nation, China is still very young." Indeed, ancient Chinese culture is rich and colorful, with countless unearthed artifacts; modern culture, however, has lagged behind, always in a state of evolution, pursuit, and hesitation.

Modern Chinese culture is a continuation and development of ancient Chinese culture, but it is not a direct continuation and development. Instead, it entered the realm of modern culture under the impact of the West, borrowing from Western culture, and transforming external influences into internal elements.

Culture is inseparable from social production, social structure, and social life; it is the manifestation and cohesive force of society. The type of society produces the type of culture. Ancient Chinese culture was formed from highly developed agricultural production. By the 17th century, during the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were signs of new culture emerging from ancient culture, but it was suppressed by the stubborn feudal production and political systems. While Western capitalism developed rapidly, they came to the East en masse. By the mid-19th century, they used force to bring China into the world capitalist system, marking the beginning of modern China. Therefore, modern China is not the same as the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, nor is it the same as the modern West; it is a transitional and unique social form. Hence, modern Chinese culture also has a strong transitional nature, always intertwined with the old and new, manifesting as complex and diverse.

This transitional social form began with the Opium War in 1840 and ended with the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, known as the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. In recent years, the academic community has had differing opinions on the term "semi-colonial and semi-feudal," as it indicates the decline of modern Chinese society and does not reflect the progressive steps of modern Chinese people. In fact, accompanying the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society is capitalist production, the growth of new class forces—the working class and the bourgeoisie, and the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution. Its connotations and extensions are multi-dimensional. Any social concept aims to indicate its nature and cannot encompass all its connotations and extensions in a single term. I believe that if a more accurate name cannot be found, "semi-colonial and semi-feudal society" is still relatively indicative of the social nature of modern China over 110 years (I have explained my views on this issue in more detail in the article "Reflections on the Historical Threads of Modern History"). It is from this unique social form that modern Chinese culture displays its unique characteristics and functions.

Modern Chinese culture is inseparable from ancient Chinese culture; it is a continuation and development of ancient culture, but not a linear continuation and development. Instead, it took a detour. Because the cultural and intellectual peaks of the Ming and Qing dynasties did not enter the realm of modern culture and did not advance into modernity, China's transition from ancient to modern times was under the impact of the West, borrowing from Western culture, leveraging its inherent assimilative power, and transforming external influences into internal elements, thus entering the realm of modern culture. In the modern torrent, unchanged traditional culture is rare; they only exist as ancient culture.

Things brought in from the West, the use of foreign concepts and methods to study and transform traditional elements, and our own innovations and inventions constitute the content of modern Chinese culture.

After beginning to scientifically understand the world, what type of culture does semi-colonial and semi-feudal China have, and what does it include? People have had various discussions, but Mao Zedong's summary in "On New Democracy" was once the most authoritative.

"On New Democracy" discusses modern Chinese society's culture from both vertical and horizontal perspectives: horizontally, it states, "In China, there is imperialist culture, which reflects the political and economic domination or semi-domination of imperialism in China. This part of the culture, in addition to the cultural institutions directly run by imperialism in China, also includes some shameless Chinese people who promote it. All cultures containing thoughts of subjugation belong to this category. In China, there is also semi-feudal culture, which reflects semi-feudal politics and semi-feudal economics. Those who advocate Confucianism, classical education, old ethics, and old thoughts, and oppose new culture and new thoughts, are all representatives of this type of culture." Vertically, it states, "Before the May Fourth Movement, the struggle on China's cultural front was between the bourgeoisie's new culture and the feudal class's old culture. At that time, what was called schools, new learning, and Western learning was basically the natural sciences and bourgeois social and political theories that the bourgeoisie representatives needed; after the May Fourth Movement, China produced a completely new cultural vanguard, which is the communist cultural thought led by the Chinese Communists, i.e., the communist worldview and theory of social revolution." His two sets of arguments, one from the perspective of semi-colonial and semi-feudal, and the other from the perspective of old democracy and new democracy, include both positive and negative aspects, with a strict political stance as the basis.

However, the semi-colonial and semi-feudal modern China, in addition to indicating the progress of the times, has another important significance: what are the contents of its modernization? Here, we are referring to modern culture. The modern Chinese culture can be summarized as follows:

First, things brought in from abroad, with the most being scientific and technological advancements. For a long time, Chinese people believed that Western science and technology were advanced, so there was less resistance in this area. They were used by China and thus became part of modern Chinese culture. In the words of Confucians: "When barbarians enter China, they become Chinese."

Second, using foreign concepts and methods to transform and study traditional elements, making them adapt to modern life and promoting social change in China. This is more prevalent in the realm of ideas, and a series of works advocating social change in China have been produced.

Third, in the process of absorption and transformation (critical inheritance), there are gradually some innovations and inventions, which have made some progress in science and technology and social politics, but the pace is slow.

The above three aspects are the necessary paths to establishing modern Chinese culture. Sun Yat-sen once summarized his own experience with "inheritance," "adaptation," and "innovation," which should reflect the historical truth.

Due to the special status of modern China, in addition to the culture that has entered the modern realm, there are also many ancient cultures that exist in modern China. Here, we are not referring to ancient artifacts preserved in museums and libraries, nor to ancient cultures that should be inherited and promoted, but to ancient cultures that manifest as national inertia and conservatism, those that should be eliminated but have not been. Mao Zedong's semi-feudal culture, more precisely, is the feudal culture within the semi-feudal society. There are two situations here: one is still completely feudal, and the other is mixed with transformed or newly emerging elements (some are even attached to certain banners), including people's thoughts and lives. The former situation becomes less common over time, while the latter is widespread.

Bringing in and breaking out are the main paths to forming modern Chinese culture, but it is a rugged and arduous road. The diversity and complexity of modern Chinese culture are inevitable phenomena of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. It is the convergence point of ancient and modern, Eastern and Western, and new and old cultures, with a hundred rivers flowing together. Among them, the conflict and fusion of Chinese and Western cultures have become the continuous waves of a hundred years.

At a conference in Changsha in December 1987 discussing modern Chinese culture, Comrade Li Kan mentioned the issue of many talents emerging from Guangdong and Hunan. I said that Hunan and Guangdong are not the same. Guangdong brings things in, while Hunan breaks out. Look at Hong Xiuquan, Hong Ren'gan, Kang Youwei (brought from Japan), and Sun Yat-sen; they all brought in some things from the West. Guo Songtao, Tan Sitong, and Chen Tianhua all broke out from traditional culture. This is a historical phenomenon related to geography. Because Guangdong is near the sea and has early connections with overseas; Hunan is inland, and one must break out. Of course, this is not absolute, and the two are interdependent. Without bringing in, one cannot break out; without breaking out, one cannot bring in.

This historical phenomenon is only more typically presented through Guangdong and Hunan. In fact, in the entire modern relationship between Chinese and Western cultures, each province and region has, to varying degrees, shown the characteristics of bringing in and breaking out. Jiangsu and Zhejiang, especially Shanghai, located by the East China Sea, can be said to be the convergence point of bringing in and breaking out. This is not only a geographical and economic trade connection point but also a convergence point of Chinese and Western cultures. Whether bringing in or breaking out, people must come to Shanghai to perform. Those who are at the forefront of modern China's history have all left their footprints in Shanghai. Although "Hai Pai" has become a derogatory term, the innovation of Hai Pai culture is a byproduct of bringing in and breaking out.

The combination of Chinese and Western cultures is the main form of modern Chinese culture. Bringing in and breaking out are the main paths to forming modern Chinese culture, but it is a rugged and arduous road, with a heavy burden and a long way to go. The reason for this is that the long-standing Chinese national culture has great cohesion and exclusivity, is very sensitive to heterodoxy, and without the resolve to "laugh at heaven with a horizontal sword" and the tenacity to persevere despite a hundred hardships, it is very difficult to break out. Chinese national culture is profound and has great capacity. The development of Confucian thought has accommodated various schools of thought and foreign cultures, mostly in a piecemeal manner. In modern times, Western culture and traditional culture are two types of cultural conflicts, not just a piecemeal issue. In modern terms, it is a comprehensive issue. To carry out comprehensive changes, there are obstacles everywhere, and comprehensive changes can only be made in pieces. Therefore, bringing in is not easy, and breaking out is also difficult, often facing a dilemma, and enduring many years.

In the pursuit of modern culture, China has long lacked a general principle until the May Fourth Movement proposed the general principle of science and democracy, concluding that modern Chinese culture should adhere to science and democracy.

The modern Chinese culture pursued is vast and complex, with new and old elements intertwined. If each item and event is stated, it has both the influx of Western scenery and the fertile soil of national culture, each with its own form and nature. What is the overall concept of modern Chinese culture? Although China is pursuing and building modern culture, it has long been entangled in the conflicts of ancient and modern, new and old, Chinese and Western, and piecemeal issues, without finding a common standard to measure modern culture. After eighty years of exploration and debate, it was not until the May Fourth Movement that the general principle of science and democracy was established, which means that modern culture should adhere to science and democracy.

Democracy and science, after people have some democratic and scientific concepts, still encounter many ignorant and authoritarian things in real life, which are anti-scientific. Therefore, democracy and science are set as the goals pursued by the whole society, and all undemocratic and unscientific things are excluded, becoming the pivot of modern Chinese culture.

Democracy and science are indeed the demands of the bourgeoisie, mainly reflecting the modern aspects of ancient and modern, Western aspects of Chinese and Western, and new aspects of new and old. But it has broken out of the frameworks of ancient and modern, Chinese and Western, and new and old, and has also surpassed the debates of essence and function, main and auxiliary. Democracy and science are both inclusive of essence and function, and also contain the useful contents of ancient, Chinese, and old, critically inheriting them.

In the history of human cultural development, democracy and science are complementary. Science is the foundation of democracy, and democracy is the conductor of science. In the pursuit of democracy and science, modern China is roughly synchronous, but it operates in two wings. They both face the stubborn resistance of feudalism, but democracy has suffered more blows. In modern China, no one was beheaded for advocating science, but many were beheaded for calling for democracy. Six were beheaded during the Hundred Days' Reform, many were beheaded during the Xinhai Revolution, and even more were beheaded during the rule of the Beiyang warlords and Chiang Kai-shek. It can be said that democracy is always unacceptable to authoritarian and dictatorial rulers, while science is often obstructed by the ignorant inertia of the masses. And these two forces in China are very stubborn, so the cultural progress of democracy and science is arduous.

Democracy and science in the West grew up by exposing the dark rule of religion with reason; in China, to expose the extreme imperial power of the Ming Dynasty, it once flourished, but it did not develop like the West from the Renaissance and Enlightenment, but stagnated under the strong rule of a minority ethnic group in the Qing Dynasty. It was not until after the Opium War, under the stimulation of capitalism in the face of a strong enemy, that it began to develop.

　　略论演化中的中国近代文化
    陈旭麓遗作
    西方把中国文化概称为中国学、支那学、汉学，也有称东方学的。东方学以中国为主，包括印度、日本，范围比中国学广。西方人讲的中国学一般是指中国的古代文化。他们对中国的概念是三条：一、疆域辽阔，二、人口众多，三、文化悠久。文化悠久就是指灿烂的中国古代文化。在他们的眼中，中国是没有什么近代文化的。直至１９７９年邓小平同志访问美国，美国总统卡特在致欢迎词时还说：中国是世界上拥有五千多年最古老文化的国家之一，但是，作为一个现代国家，中国还是很年轻的。确实，中国的古代文化丰富多彩，出土文物层出不穷；近代文化却落后了，始终处于演化、追逐、徘徊的状态。
　　中国近代文化是中国古代文化的延续和发展，但不是直接的延续和
　　发展，而是在西方的冲击下，借鉴西方文化，变外来为内在，才进入近
　　代文化领域的。
    文化与社会生产、社会构造、社会生活而俱来，它是社会的表象和凝聚力，怎样的社会产生怎样的文化体。中国古代文化是从高度发展的农业生产凝聚起来的。到了十七世纪的明清之际，中国有从古代文化孕育出新文化的迹象，但没有破土就被顽梗的封建生产方式和封建政治窒息了。而西方的资本主义迅猛发展，他们相率东来，到了十九世纪中期，施加暴力，把中国纳入世界资本主义体系，开始了中国的近代。所以近代的中国已不是唐宋元明清那时的中国，又不同于西方资本主义世界的近代，而成为一种过渡的特殊形态社会。因此，中国的近代文化也有很大的过渡性，始终处于新旧交织之中，表现为复杂和多样。
    这个过渡形态社会起于１８４０年的鸦片战争，迄于１９４９年中华人民共和国诞生，即久已熟称的半殖民地半封建社会。近年来学术界对半殖民地半封建的连称颇有异议，以其标示了中国近代社会的沉落，而看不出近代中国人前进的步伐。其实，伴随半殖民地半封建而来的就有资本主义生产，就有新的阶级力量——工人阶级和资产阶级的成长，就有反帝反封建的民主革命，它的内涵和外延是多维的。任何一个社会概念，在于表明它的性态，不可能把它的内涵和外延都堆积到字面上来。我以为，如果找不到更确切的名称，半殖民地半封建社会还是比较能够表明近代中国１１０年的社会性态的（我在《关于近代史线索的思考》一文中较详细地说明了对这个问题的意见）。中国的近代文化正是从这样一个特殊社会形态展示其特殊风貌和职能的。
    中国的近代文化与中国的古代文化是不可分割的，它是古代文化的延续和发展，但不是直线的延续和发展，而是绕着弯子走的。因为明清之际中国的思想文化出现过的高峰，并没有进入近代文化的领域，也没有推向近代。中国由古代到近代的转折，是在西方的冲击下，借鉴西方文化，发挥其固有的融合力，变外来为内在，才进入近代文化领域的。在近代的急流中，原封不动的固有文化也是罕见的，它们只是作为古代文化而存在。
　从西方搬来的东西，借用外国的观念和方法对传统的东西研究改造 　　，以及自己的创获和发明，构成了中国近代文化的内容。
    从对世界开始科学的认识之后，半殖民地半封建中国的文化类型怎样，它包括了哪些内容？人们有过各种各样的论述，而毛泽东在《新民主主义论》中所作的概括，曾经是最富权威性的。
    《新民主主义论》对近代中国社会的文化，作了纵向和横向两个方面的论证：横的方面说，“在中国，有帝国主义文化，这是反映帝国主义在政治上经济上统治或半统治中国的东西。这一部分文化，除了帝国主义在中国直接办理的文化机关之外，还有一些无耻的中国人也在提倡。一切包含奴化思想的文化，都属于这一类。在中国又有半封建文化，这是反映半封建政治和半封建经济的东西，凡属主张尊孔读经、提倡旧礼教旧思想、反对新文化新思想的人们，都是这类文化的代表。”纵的方面说，“在‘五四’以前，中国文化战线上的斗争，是资产阶级的新文化和封建阶级的旧文化的斗争。”“那时的所谓学校、新学、西学，基本上都是资产阶级代表们所需要的自然科学和资产阶级的社会政治学说”；“在‘五四’以后，中国产生了完全崭新的文化生力军，这就是中国共产党人所领导的共产主义的文化思想，即共产主义的宇宙观和社会革命论。”他的两对论证，一对是从半殖民地与半封建着眼的，一对是从旧民主与新民主立论的，包括正反两个方面，以严格的政治立场为归依。
    但半殖民地半封建中国的近代，除了标示时代的进程外，还有一个重要意义，它有哪些近代化的内容，这里是指近代文化而言。数得上中国的近代文化有这样几个方面：
    一、从外国搬过来的东西，科学技术搬来的最多，很长时期中国人认为西方的科学技术先进，所以在这方面的阻力比较小，既为中国所用也就成为中国近代文化的组成部分，拿儒家的话来说：“夷狄进于中国则中国之。”
    二、借用外国的观念和方法，对中国固有的东西进行改造和研究，使其与近代生活相适应，以促进中国社会的变革。这在观念形态方面的东西居多，已经产生了一系列变革中国社会的论著。
    三、在吸收和改造（批判继承）的过程中，渐有自己的创获和发明，这在科学技术上、社会政治上都有一些，但进展的步子很小、很慢。
    以上三者是建立近代中国文化的必由之路，孙中山曾经以“因袭”、“规抚”、“创获”三者总结了他自己的经历，应该说是反映了历史的真实。
    由于近代中国的特殊地位，除了进入近代文化领域的文化外，还有存在于近代中国的许多古代文化。这里说的不是保存于博物馆图书馆的古代文物，也不是指该继承发扬的古代文化，而是表现为民族惰性、保守性的古代文化，那些该淘汰而未被淘汰的东西。毛泽东说的半封建文化，确切地说是半封建社会中的封建文化。这里有两种情况，一种仍全然是封建的，另一种夹杂在经过改造或新生的事物中（有的更是依附于某些大旗下），包括人们的思想和生活，前一种情况愈到后来愈少，后一种情况则大量存在。
　拿进来和冲出去是造成近代中国文化的主要途径，然而是一条崎岖
　艰辛的路。近代中国文化的多样、复杂，是半殖民地半封建社会的
     必然现象，它是古今、中西、新旧文化的汇合点，百川竞流，其中又以中西文化的冲突和交融成为百年相继的层见叠出的浪潮。
    １９８７年１２月在长沙讨论中国近代文化的会上，李侃同志说到近代广东和湖南出了那么多人才的问题。我说湖南和广东不太一样，广东是拿进来，湖南是冲出去。你看洪秀全、洪仁玕、康有为（从日本拿）、孙中山都从西方拿进来一些东西；郭嵩焘、谭嗣同、陈天华都是从传统文化中冲出去，这是地缘关系里的历史现象。因为广东近海，与海外联系早；湖南地处内陆，不冲出去不行。当然这不是绝对的，二者是互相依托的。不拿进来就冲不出去，不冲出去就拿不进来。
    这一历史现象只是通过广东与湖南较典型地呈现出来。其实在整个近代的中西文化关系上，各个省区都不同程度表现为拿进来和冲出去，而地处东海之滨的江苏、浙江特别是上海，可以说是拿进来和冲出去的汇合地。这不只是地理交通和经济贸易上的联结点，更是中西文化汇合的联结点，无论拿进来或冲出去的人们，都要到上海来演奏，走在历史前列的近代中国人谁不在上海留下了他们的雪泥鸿爪？“海派”尽管流为嘲弄之词，而海派文化的开新正是拿进来和冲出去的副产品。
    中西文化结合是近代中国文化的主要形式，拿进来和冲出去则是造成近代中国文化的主要途径，然而是一条崎岖的艰辛的路，任重而道远。其所以如此，是因为悠久的中国民族文化有很大的凝固性和排他性，对异端很敏感，没有“我自横刀向天笑”的毅力，没有百折不挠的韧劲是很难冲出去的。中国民族文化源远流长，也有很大的容量，儒家思想的发展就容纳了各种思想学派及域外文化，大都是一端一节的。到了近代，西方文化与传统文化是两种文化类型的冲突，就不是一端一节的问题，拿现在的新词来说是一个全方位的问题。要进行全方位的变革，到处都是阻力，全方位只能割碎来拿。所以拿进来不易，冲出去也很难，常常处于两难之中，挨过了许多岁月。
　中国在追求近代文化的过程中，长期没有找到一个总准则，直到“
　五四”时提出了科学和民主的总准则，才得出了中国近代文化
     要以科学和民主为归依的结论。
    中国追求的近代文化经纬万端，新旧交叉错综，如果一件件、一桩桩陈述，它既有纷至沓来的西方景物，又有民族文化的沃壤，各有自己的形态和性态。作为近代中国文化的总概念是什么？中国虽然在追求和建设近代文化，但是长期搅扰于古今、新旧、中西和一端一节的纷争中，没有找到一个衡鉴近代文化的共同准则。经过八十年的摸索和论争，直到“五四”时才得出了科学和民主总准则，那是说近代文化要以科学和民主为归依。
    民主与科学是在人们有了若干民主和科学的观念以后，在现实生活中碰到的许多事，仍是愚昧的专制主义的，是反科学的，所以才把民主与科学悬为全社会追求的目标，凡不民主不科学的东西均在排斥之列，为近代中国文化的枢纽。
    民主与科学诚然仍是资产阶级要求，主要体现了古今的今、中西的西、新旧的新，但它已冲出了古今、中西、新旧的框架，也越过了体用，本末、主辅之争，民主与科学就是体用并包的，同时也内涵古、中、旧的有用的内容，批判继承。
    在人类文化的发展史上，民主和科学是相辅而行的，科学是民主的基石，民主是科学的导体。近代中国在追求民主和科学的道路上大体是同步的，又分为两翼运行，它们都遭到封建主义的顽抗，但民主比科学受到的打击更大。近代中国没有因倡导科学而杀头的，为呼唤民主而被杀头的就多了。戊戌政变中杀了６个，辛亥革命时杀了许多，北洋军阀和蒋介石统治时杀得更多。可以这样说：民主总为专制、独裁的统治者所不容，科学则常被愚昧的民间惯性所阻塞。而这两股势力在中国都很顽梗，所以民主和科学的文化举步艰难。
    民主与科学在西方是以理性揭露宗教的黑暗统治而成长起来的；在中国为揭露明朝的极端皇权政治曾经活跃起来，但不像西方由文艺复兴、启蒙思想一直发展下来，而在清朝以强悍的少数民族统治而停滞了。直到鸦片战争后，在强敌压境的资本主义刺激下才开展起来。
