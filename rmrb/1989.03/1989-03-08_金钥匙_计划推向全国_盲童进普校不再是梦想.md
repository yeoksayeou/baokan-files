The "Golden Key" blind children's education plan, which is currently being promoted nationwide, aims to bring tens of thousands of blind children, who have been kept out of schools, into the classroom. Comrade Kang Keqing recently wrote an inscription for this initiative: "Serving blind children is like sending charcoal in snow."

The core of this plan is to mobilize various sectors of society to make special arrangements, allowing blind children to attend nearby regular schools and study in regular classes. Reports indicate that the enrollment rate for the more than ten million blind school-age children in China has never exceeded 3%. Currently, there are only 64 schools nationwide that can take on the responsibility of educating blind children.

The founder and promoter of the "Golden Key" blind children's education plan is Xu Bailun, a nearly 60-year-old blind person. He understands the plight of blind children and, after years of tireless efforts, collaborated with Hu Jianzhong, the secretary-general of the Chinese Children's Reading Material Research Association, to compile "A Golden Key for You." With this set of teaching materials, blind children can learn Braille on their own with minimal guidance from sighted individuals. After half a year, they can transfer to regular schools and study in regular classes. The pilot program in 16 counties and cities in Jiangsu, Shanxi, Hebei, and Beijing has been successful.

### “金钥匙”计划推向全国  盲童进普校不再是梦想

　　“金钥匙”计划推向全国
    盲童进普校不再是梦想
    据新华社北京３月７日电  （记者李忠诚）正在全国推广的“金钥匙盲童教育计划”可把关在学校门外的十多万学龄盲童带进学堂。康克清同志新近为此举题词：“为盲童服务是雪中送炭”。
    这个计划的核心是：广泛动员社会各界力量，通过一些特殊的安排，使盲童能够就近进入普通学校，随班就读。有材料介绍说，我国十多万学龄盲童的入学率始终未超过３％。目前能承担教育盲童的学校全国仅有６４所。
    “金钥匙盲童教育计划”的创办者和推广人是年近花甲的盲人徐白仑。他深知盲童的苦衷，经多年四处奔波，与中国幼儿读物研究会秘书长胡建中合编了《送你一把金钥匙》。用这套教材，只要在明眼人的稍许辅导下，盲童就可以自学盲文，半年以后，就可转入普通学校随班就读。经在江苏、山西、河北、北京等地１６县市的试点，均获得成功。
