Confusion, Impulsiveness, Hope
— A Discussion on the "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" in a University Dormitory

By Zhou Qing, Reporter of People's Daily

How do graduate students and undergraduates view the "new theory of the uselessness of reading"? At the beginning of the new semester, with the help of two graduate student cadres from Renmin University of China, the reporter participated in a dormitory discussion held on the 8th floor of the school, hearing their confusion and understanding their views.

Reading more seems to lead to more disadvantages, not reading seems to be a waste, and it's hard to back down once you start.

Shao Guohuan (Graduate student, Agricultural Economics Department): During the winter vacation, I met a graduate student who had dropped out and returned to his hometown. He was temporarily working in a township enterprise, and his situation was not good. He missed his major but did not regret dropping out: the scholarship during his studies could only cover food, not clothing, and he still had to ask his family for money. After graduation, the salary could barely maintain daily life, but when it came to starting a family, it was "miserable." Seeing the situation of past graduates made one's mood unsettled. It was better to go out and try than to sit and wait for poverty. The words of this dropout were not false. During the winter vacation, many graduate students had to borrow money to buy train tickets. It's tough now, but after graduation, without the support of the family, it will be even tougher. The treatment of young intellectuals is low, and they have nowhere to rely on, making it difficult for them to study in peace. Especially for the new generation of intellectuals, their value concepts are significantly different from the older generation. They hope that their labor and contributions to society can be rewarded accordingly. Otherwise, they will seek other paths. Society should pay full attention to this. Of course, we should improve the treatment of those truly outstanding and contributing intellectuals, not high prices to support those who just eat.

Shao Jianjun (Graduate student, History Department): My hometown is Shaoxing. My peers there are all richer than me. A young girl who left home to work could save enough money to start a family in three to five years. How many years after graduation could I save enough to start a family? I really don't dare to say. The time and effort we spend on reading and the subsequent treatment are not equivalent, and it is psychologically unbalanced. In this situation, it is not worth continuing to read, but not reading is also a waste. Graduate students are right in the middle of choosing, and it's hard to back down.

Feng Wencheng (Graduate student, Chinese Literature Department): I have been studying for 17 years, crossing one threshold after another, sweating and suffering a lot, and I know it best. Now books are expensive, paper is expensive, vegetables are expensive... where doesn't need money? Now they all blame college students for not studying well, doing business, and working part-time. This phenomenon is not strange. I know why they do this, and I sympathize with them. Intellectuals also need to eat, drink, live, and dress before they can consider engaging in scientific and cultural work. If they spend most of their time solving the necessities of life, how can they concentrate on scientific and cultural work?

Jiang Li (Female, Graduate student, Russian Language Department, Northeast Normal University, she came to visit a classmate and happened to encounter the discussion): I will graduate in July, and I have been looking for a job in Beijing for two months. I first stayed in a hotel, then at a classmate's home. During this period, I visited nearly a hundred units and even sneaked into a "supply and demand meeting" where students were not allowed to enter. I also participated in 3 interviews, but the results are still unknown. During this period, my mind was filled with too many things, and I encountered many other graduate students looking for jobs from other schools, which made me have many thoughts and complaints. Many units explicitly stated "no graduate students," which was unexpected. My major is Russian and Soviet literature, and it is extremely difficult to find a relevant unit. Changing careers and starting over is also an option. But now, graduate students and college students are not in short supply, and the employing units have a lot of choices, and they do not consider those who change careers. It is difficult to leave this "home." Originally, I thought that after graduating from graduate school, I would have a major and be able to find a satisfactory job. I did not expect it to be worse than graduating from college and starting work immediately. At that time, I could go to schools, research institutes, foreign trade departments, publishing houses, and government agencies, with a wide range of choices. If I had worked until now, the "seniority" in the unit would also be several years, which is more effective in promotions and housing allocation than learning new knowledge. The more you read, the more you lose.

Books that are useless, when will we be able to read less?

Cheng Dai (Female, Undergraduate, Party History Department): Whether reading is useful or not depends on what you read. For example, in our Party History Department, and in the National Politics Department and Philosophy Department, some of the courses and textbooks are really outdated. Some old topics like the background of the Opium War and the significance of the October Revolution have been taught from elementary school to university, making some students want to skip class and do part-time jobs. There are also many so-called theories that are boring to listen to and useless to learn, who wouldn't be bored?

In fact, which college student doesn't want to learn some real skills? As long as they can learn knowledge, who wouldn't want to attend classes? In our department, Professor Xiao Yanzhong's elective course "Research on Mao Zedong's Late Thoughts" and another professor's course "Ten Years of the Cultural Revolution" are so popular that you have to go to the classroom early to secure a seat. Also, after the new semester starts, the reading room is full, and the vast majority are learning foreign languages. Everyone can see that learning foreign languages is useful.

I think the main problem now is that students don't know what to learn and what is useful. This is especially true in liberal arts departments, especially in some theoretical majors. Although there are few students who waste time in college, there are many students who are in a state of confusion, and this is the biggest pain point for college students.

Fan Jiajin (Graduate student, Chinese Literature Department): I worked for 4 years after graduating from college and then returned to graduate school. The more years I spend in school, the heavier my sense of disappointment. Pure-hearted youth spend their best years studying hard, but the social science theories they learn are often illusory and even contrary to reality. This is an important reason for the spread of the anti-study trend. Therefore, I think the main problem in education now is not "reading is useless," but that there are too many useless things in the books students read.

Often feeling the impulse to throw away books, but after thinking, it's still better to read.

Liu Nan (Female, Undergraduate, International Finance Department): A classmate of mine from high school was admitted to a key university, studied for a year and a half, and insisted on dropping out. The school did not agree, so he failed 4 courses and did not pass the make-up exams. He said, "I've figured it out, in this world, money talks." He is a typical "reading is useless" advocate. I also know a girl who worked at the Shangri-La Hotel for a few years and suddenly quit her job, using her savings to study at a university. I asked some classmates who made a lot of money, what is the one thing you want to do most now, and they all said "read books."

The situations of my former classmates have influenced me. Seeing those with pockets full of money, I secretly feel a bit inferior and often have the impulse to throw away my books and go out into society. I believe I can do no worse than others. But more often, I still believe that our hard work will be rewarded. In this world, the more skills you have, the more paths you have, and the more knowledge you have, the more hope you have for success. As long as you study well, the money, experience, and opportunities lost in these 4 years will all be made up for.

Cheng Dai: Young people today should have a broader vision. Not reading and wasting time will only harm yourself in the end. In the past, when educated youth went to the countryside, those who did not throw away their books later had the opportunity to study again.

Zhao Binglin (Undergraduate, Planning Department): I will graduate this summer. In the past 4 years, I have learned gymnastics in the school gymnastics team, played the flute in the school art troupe, served as a class monitor and student union cadre, set up a wireless radio service department, and started a "Qifeng" business center with a few classmates, causing quite a stir. Now, looking back at my experiences, my conclusion is: it's still better to read more.

In these 4 years, I have met too many people. Those who are ignorant and unlearned may also be able to cause a stir, but they always give people a shallow feeling, lacking inner strength and development potential, and are often despised by the majority. When I was the busiest, my reading time was relatively reduced, and I always felt like I had lost something precious, a sense of emptiness. This feeling is more painful than physical fatigue. After entering the fourth year, I stopped all activities and began to concentrate on reading, and applied for graduate school. Many people do not understand my actions and advise me to go out and do something, make money. To be honest, seeing some abnormal phenomena in society, the devaluation of knowledge, I have also wavered. But after thinking it over, money can make people noble, but it can also make people degenerate. After thinking it over, I still decided to apply for graduate school. Now I have finished the exam, and there are still a few months until graduation. I do not plan to rest and will read more. I hope to maintain this "momentum."

### 迷惘·冲动·希望——大学宿舍里关于“读书无用论”的一次恳谈会

专栏：我看“新的读书无用论”

　　迷惘·冲动·希望
    ——大学宿舍里关于“读书无用论”的一次恳谈会
    本报记者  周庆
    研究生、大学生如何看待“新的读书无用论”？新学期之始，承蒙中国人民大学两位研究生干部的帮助，记者参加了该校学８楼一次宿舍恳谈会，听出了他们的迷惘，了解了他们的看法。
    读书越多越吃亏，不读又觉得可惜，骑虎难下
    邵国焕（农经系研究生）：寒假我碰到一位退学回乡的研究生，暂时在一家乡镇企业供职，处境并不佳。他很留恋自己的专业，但对退学并不后悔：上学期间那点助学金管吃管不了穿，还要向家里伸手。毕业后的工资勉强维持日常生活，可一谈到成家立业就“惨不可言”了。看看以往毕业生的景况，让人心境难平，与其坐以守穷，不如出去闯闯。
    这位退学者的话不假。寒假探家，不少研究生靠借钱买车票。现在苦点可以，可是毕业后失去家庭的资助，比这还苦。青年知识分子待遇低，学无所用，学无所靠，难以让人安心读书。特别是新一代知识分子在价值观念上同老一代有显著不同，他们希望自己对社会付出的劳动和贡献能得到相应的报酬。否则，就要另寻出路。对这一点，社会应有充分的注意。当然，要注意提高那些真正出众的、有贡献的知识分子的待遇，而不是高价去养活那些混饭吃的人。
    邵建军（历史系研究生）：我的家乡是绍兴，家乡的同龄人都比我富。一个小姑娘离家打工，三五年攒够成家的钱没有问题。我毕业后工作多少年能攒够成家的钱？真不敢说。我们读书所花费的时间、付出的代价与以后的待遇不等价，心理上不平衡。在此情况下，这书读下去不值得，不读了又可惜，研究生正好处于选择的当中，骑虎难下。
    冯文成（中文系研究生）：我读书已经１７年了，跨过一个又一个台阶，流了多少汗，吃了多少苦，自己最清楚。如今书涨价，纸涨价，菜涨价……哪里不用钱呢？现在都怨大学生不好好读书，经商，打工。这种现象没什么奇怪的。我知道他们为什么这样做，我同情他们。知识分子也必须吃、喝、住、穿，然后才能考虑从事科学文化事业。如果他们把大部分时间都花在解决生活必需品上，怎能安心于科学文化事业呢？
    蒋莉（女，东北师大俄语系研究生，她来看同学，恰好碰上恳谈会）：我今年７月份毕业，来京求职两个月了，先住招待所，住不起了，又住同学家。这期间跑了近百个单位，也曾混入不让学生进去的“供需见面会”，还参加了３次面试，结果怎样，尚不得而知。这一段脑子里装的事太多了，碰到的其他学校求职的研究生也不少，使我产生很多感想和牢骚。不少单位明确表示“不要研究生”，太出人意料了。我的专业是俄苏文学，找对口单位异常困难，改行“半路出家”干别的也行。可现在研究生、大学生不紧缺，用人单位大有选择的余地，对改行者根本不考虑，出这个“家”又谈何容易？原来我想，读了研究生有专业，能找一个称心如意的工作，没想到还不如大学一毕业就工作呢。那时我可以到学校，到研究所，到外贸部门，到出版社，到机关，选择面很宽。如果工作到现在，“单位工龄”也好几年了，这在提职、分房中作用比学习新知识大多了。这书是越读越吃亏。
    无用的书，何日才能让我们少读点
    程岱（女，党史系本科生）：读书到底是有用还是无用，那得看读什么书了。像我们党史系，还有国政系、哲学系，开的某些课，教材实在太陈旧了。一些老话题如鸦片战争的背景、十月革命的意义等，从小学讲到大学，讲得不少学生不由得想逃课，搞副业。还有不少所谓理论，听了没趣，学了没用，谁能不厌烦呢？
    其实，上大学的青年哪个不想学点真本事呢？只要能学到知识，又哪里会不想听课呢？我们系萧延中老师开的选修课《毛泽东晚年思想研究》，另一位老师讲的《“文革”十年史》，不提前去教室占座，根本就没有你听课的地方。还有，新学期开学后，阅览室满满的，绝大多数是学外语的，大家看得清楚，外语学了有用。
    我觉得，现在的主要问题，是学生不知道该学什么，不知道学什么有用。这在文科系、特别是一些理论专业，尤其突出。大学里混日子的毕竟是少数，但处于这种迷惘状态的同学却不少，这就是大学生最大的苦闷。
    范家进（中文系研究生）：我是大学毕业后工作了４年又读研究生的。可上学的年头越多，失望情绪越重。纯真的青年把大好时光用来苦读，学到的社会科学理论不少都是一些虚幻的、甚至和实际南辕北辙的东西，这是助长厌学风的一个重要原因。所以我认为目前教育上的主要问题不是“读书无用”，而是让学生读的书中无用的东西太多。
    常常产生想扔掉书本的冲动，但思考的结果还是要读书
    刘楠（女，国际金融系本科生）：我高中时的一个同学考入重点大学，读了一年半，非要退学，学校不同意，他就来个４门不及格，补考不及格。他说：“我算明白了，这世道谁有钱谁是大爷。”他是典型的“读书无用论”者。我还认识一个女孩，在香格里拉饭店干了几年，有一天突然辞掉了工作，用自己的积蓄自费上了大学。我问一些赚了大钱的中学同学，你们现在最想做的一件事是什么，他们都回答说是“读书”。
    往日同窗们的这些情况，对我都有影响。看到那些人口袋里装满人民币，不知为什么自己心里隐隐地感到有些自卑，常常产生一种冲动，想扔开书本，早点去闯社会。我相信自己干得不会比别人差。但更多的时候，我还是相信，我们的苦读总会得到报偿的。在这个世界上，还是本事越大路越多，知识越多越有成功的希望。只要学好了，这４年失去的金钱、经验与机遇，都会找回来。
    程岱：现在的年轻人目光应该放远点，不读书，混日子，到头来受坑的还是自己。当年知识青年下乡，那些没有扔掉书本的，后来都遇到了重新学习的机会。
    赵冰林（计划系本科生）：今年暑假我就要毕业了。大学４年，我在校体操队学过体操，在校艺术团吹过长笛，当过班长和学生会干部，办过无线电服务部，还和几个同学搞过“劲风”实业中心，大大“折腾”了一阵。如今回过头来谈感受，我的结论是：还是要多读书。
    这４年，我接触的人太多了。那些不学无术的人，尽管也能瞎折腾，但总给人一种肤浅的感觉，缺乏内在的力量和发展后劲，往往为大多数人所不屑。我自己在最忙乎的时候，读书时间相对减少，总觉得丢掉了什么宝贵的东西，有一种空虚感。这种感觉比肉体上的劳累更令人难受。进入四年级后，我停止了一切活动，开始安心读书，并报考了研究生。不少人对我的做法不理解，劝我出去干点实事，赚钱去。说实话，看到社会上一些不正常的现象，知识贬值，我也真动摇过。但仔细想想，钱这东西可以使人变得高尚，也可以使人堕落。想来想去，还是决心考研究生。现在已经考完了，离毕业还有几个月时间，我不打算休息，还要多读点书，我希望自己能保持这种“惯性”。
