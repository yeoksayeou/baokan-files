	Zheng Tuobin Says Twenty Types of Goods Will Be Strictly Managed
	Economic and Administrative Measures Will Be Taken to Prevent "Wars" Over Agricultural Products

	New China News Agency, Beijing, March 28 (Reporters Wu Shishen, Li Zhiyong) — Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin said on the 27th that the state will adopt strict economic and administrative measures to prevent and stop "wars" over agricultural products. The foreign trade sector has already listed twenty major commodities under strict management this year to prevent problems before they arise.

	Zheng Tuobin analyzed the causes of the "rabbit fur war" and the "ramie war" at the meeting of the Shanghai delegation to the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress. He said that in the past, foreign trade was monopolized by a single entity, but now it is operated by multiple entities, with diversified interests. Some regions and departments, following international market trends, rush in to make money, leading to a rush of similar activities. At the same time, differences in exchange rate costs and foreign exchange retention conditions between regions and departments also lead to abnormal commodity flows. The frequent occurrence of "wars" is mainly due to the lack of coordination in policies and measures during the reform, especially the lack of a rational domestic price system. Zheng Tuobin admitted that the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade bears some responsibility for some of these "wars."

	Zheng Tuobin revealed that the State Council will directly intervene with administrative and economic measures to stop new product "wars."

　　郑拓彬说对二十种商品将严格管理        
    采取经济行政严厉手段
    防止农产品“大战”再起
    新华社北京三月二十八日电  （记者吴士深、李志勇）经贸部部长郑拓彬二十七日说，国家将采取严厉的经济手段、行政手段防止和制止农产品“大战”。外贸部门今年已将二十种主要商品列入严格管理范围，防患于未然。
    郑拓彬在七届全国人大二次会议上海代表团会议上具体分析“兔毛大战”、“苎麻大战”等产生的原因。他说，过去外贸独家经营，现在多家经营，利益多元化。一些地区、部门随国际市场行情，见赚钱的就抢，一哄而起。同时，地区、部门之间换汇成本、外汇留成条件不同，也导致商品流向畸变。“大战”的频繁发生，主要是改革中政策、措施配套不够，特别是国内价格体系未理顺。郑拓彬承认，经贸部对一些“大战”负有责任。
    郑拓彬透露，国务院将以行政、经济手段直接加以干预，制止新的产品“大战”。
