Zhao Ziyang Discusses Establishing a New System for Ideological and Political Work in Enterprises
Factory Director's Comprehensive Responsibility System is Completely Feasible
Ideological and Economic Work Should Not Be Separated

    Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, held a discussion this morning in the Hall of Remembrance with 46 directors and managers of large and medium-sized enterprises on strengthening ideological and political work in enterprises and discussed the establishment of a new system for ideological and political work.

    Zhao Ziyang pointed out that establishing a new system where factory directors are fully responsible for both material and spiritual civilization in enterprises is in line with the needs of modern scientific management of enterprises. It is a manifestation of China's economic system reform and political system reform in enterprises and an important part of the economic system reform and political system reform. There should be no hesitation or vacillation. The transition period from the old system to the new system should be shortened as much as possible. The longer the transition period, the greater the loss.

    Zhao Ziyang and other leaders, including Hu Qili, Rui Xiongwen, and Wen Jiabao, listened to reports from Bo Haolin, director of Shanghai Cigarette Factory, and Wang Rulin, director of Huabei Pharmaceutical Factory, about the ideological and political work in their enterprises. Zhao Ziyang said that in the scientific management methods created and implemented by some enterprises, there are always contents related to ideological and political work. Ideological and political work is about mobilizing people's enthusiasm. People are the most important and active productive force. If an enterprise only manages production without doing people's work, it will definitely not be successful.

    Zhao Ziyang said that establishing a new system, there are not many successful examples at the beginning, which is not something to be afraid of. Currently, it seems that implementing the factory director's comprehensive responsibility system has many difficulties, but we should see that a batch of enterprises have done well, and their results are successful. This shows that this path is feasible. We should seriously summarize and promote these successful experiences. From the current problems, the main issue is that some responsible comrades in enterprises do not understand, adapt, or are familiar with the new system, which is not surprising. Implementing a new system will inevitably have problems of not understanding, adapting, or being familiar with it at the beginning. We should do solid work to make enterprise comrades quickly understand, adapt, and be familiar with the new system and new working methods. We should firmly implement the "Enterprise Law" and relevant notices from the Central Committee. As long as we firmly do it, there will be experience and methods.

    When discussing the new system of factory director's comprehensive responsibility, Zhao Ziyang said that ideological work and economic work must be integrated, and we should not have "two separate systems." The new system is beneficial for making ideological and political work an important part of modern enterprise management, mobilizing the strength of all aspects of the enterprise, expanding the coverage of ideological and political work, and integrating material incentives with ideological work, factory director's responsibility with democratic management, making ideological and political work penetrate into production, management, distribution, and other aspects. Implementing the new system can better implement ideological and political work, promote economic work, and ensure economic work. Otherwise, like in the past, the factory director manages production, and the secretary manages ideological and political work. In today's enterprises that operate independently and are responsible for their own profits and losses, there will be a problem: who is responsible for the success or failure of the enterprise?

    Zhao Ziyang said that after implementing the new system, the secretary of the enterprise party committee should concentrate their energy on the party's work and party building, playing the role of the party organization as a fortress and the party members as vanguards and models. Truly doing these works well will be an important guarantee for running the enterprise well. The secretary of the party committee should also assist the factory director in doing a good job in ideological and political work. Zhao Ziyang hoped that the factory directors, managers, and secretaries could quickly take up their positions. The current key is to help the factory director take up his position because he bears the overall responsibility. Currently, some factory directors are still far from this requirement, but Zhao Ziyang believed that most of the current factory directors and managers would become comprehensive talents in both material and spiritual civilization after taking up their positions.

    Zhao Ziyang finally said that to smoothly carry out rectification and reorganization and quickly get out of difficulties, we must improve the efficiency of enterprises. According to the "Enterprise Law," the rights that should be given to enterprises must be given, so that enterprises can strengthen management, tap internal potential, and improve economic efficiency. At the same time, enterprises should make more contributions to the state.

    Hu Qili and Rui Xiongwen also spoke at the discussion.

    It is understood that the 46 enterprise leaders participating in the discussion were specially invited to Beijing to attend the ideological and political work training class organized by the Propaganda Department. The training class began on March 12th and will end on March 25th.

　　赵紫阳谈建立企业思想政治工作新体制        
    厂长全面负责制完全行得通        
    思想与经济工作不搞两张皮
    新华社北京３月２２日电  （记者徐克洪）中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天上午在怀仁堂同４６位大中型企业厂长、经理一起座谈加强企业思想政治工作，就建立思想政治工作新体制问题作了重要的谈话。
    赵紫阳指出，建立厂长对企业中两个文明建设全面负责的新体制，是符合企业现代化科学管理需要的，是我国经济体制改革和政治体制改革在企业中的体现，也是经济体制改革和政治体制改革的重要组成部分。对此，不应犹豫、徘徊。应尽量缩短从旧体制向新体制转换的过渡时间，过渡时间拖得越长，损失越大。
    赵紫阳与胡启立、芮杏文、温家宝等领导同志听取了上海卷烟厂厂长董浩林、华北制药厂厂长王汝霖等关于企业思想政治工作情况的汇报。赵紫阳说，一些企业创造和实行的科学管理工作法中，都有做思想政治工作的内容。思想政治工作，就是调动人的积极性。人是最重要、最活跃的生产力。一个企业如果只管生产不做人的工作，那肯定是搞不好的。
    赵紫阳说，建立一个新体制，在开始时成功的范例还不多，这不要怕。现在听起来似乎实行厂长全面负责制困难不少，但要看到，目前已有一批企业搞得好，他们实行的结果是成功的。这就说明这个路是走得通的。要认真总结、推广这些成功的经验。从当前存在的问题看，主要是企业一些负责同志对新体制不理解、不适应、不熟悉，这没有什么可奇怪的。实行一个新的制度，开始总会有不理解、不适应、不熟悉的问题。我们要扎扎实实地做工作，使企业的同志尽快地理解、适应、熟悉新的体制，新的工作方法。要坚定不移地贯彻《企业法》和中央的有关通知。只要坚定地去做，就会有经验、有办法。
    在论及厂长全面负责制新体制时，赵紫阳说，思想工作同经济工作必须融为一体，不能搞“两张皮”。新体制有利于使思想政治工作成为现代化企业管理的重要组成部分，有利于调动企业各方面的力量，扩大思想政治工作的覆盖面；有利于物质鼓励与思想工作相结合，厂长负责与民主管理相结合，使思想政治工作渗透到生产、管理、分配等各个方面。实行新体制，可以更好地把思想政治工作落到实处，促进经济工作，保证经济工作。否则，像以前那样，厂长管生产，书记管思想政治工作，在企业已成为独立经营、自负盈亏的法人的今天，就会产生一个问题：企业的兴衰成败由谁来负责？
    赵紫阳说，实行新体制后，企业的党委书记应当把精力集中用到党的工作和党的建设上，发挥党组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用。真正把这些工作做好了，办好企业也就有了重要的保证。党委书记还要协助厂长抓好思想政治工作。赵紫阳希望企业厂长、经理、书记们都能够尽快到位。当前的关键是帮助厂长到位，因为他负有全面责任。目前有些厂长离这个要求还有距离，赵紫阳表示相信，现有企业的绝大多数厂长、经理在就位后能够成为统一抓好物质文明和精神文明的全面人才。
    赵紫阳最后说，要顺利进行治理、整顿，尽快从困难中走出去，必须提高企业的效益。按照《企业法》，该给企业的权一定要给，以使企业加强经营管理，挖掘内部潜力，提高经济效益。同时，企业要对国家多做贡献。
    胡启立、芮杏文也在座谈中讲了话。
    据了解，参加座谈的４６位全国大中型企业负责人是专程来京参加中宣部思想政治工作研修班的，研修班于１２日开始，将于２５日结束。
