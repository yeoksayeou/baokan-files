Title: The Difficulties of Driving and Riding

Recently, the road transport sector has been reporting "difficulties in driving," while passengers are complaining about "difficulties in riding." What are the reasons behind these issues? Based on the situation at my company, I believe there are three main difficulties:

First, there is a severe shortage of gasoline. In just the past four months, over 1,000 of our company's vehicles (trips) were forced to stop due to lack of fuel. This not only affects the economic performance of the transportation enterprises but also causes inconvenience for passengers.

Second, the problem of excessive checkpoints and fines is becoming increasingly severe. In the past, drivers only needed to carry their driver's license, vehicle registration certificate, and travel permit. Now, drivers need to carry nearly 20 different certificates, including operating licenses, safety fee certificates, business permits, route approval certificates, and permits to enter other regions. Even with all these documents, inspectors sometimes still claim they are incomplete and fine the drivers tens or even hundreds of yuan without issuing a receipt. In mid-November last year, two of our company's buses from Baoji to Xi'an were fined 70 yuan and 40 yuan respectively by the Xi'an Industrial and Commercial Bureau for not having a business license. Our company only has one enterprise business license, and it is not practical for each driver to carry it. Drivers dare not speak out against such fines. On November 13 last year, one of our company's buses from Xi'an to Baoji was stopped in Xianyang City for a traffic inspection. The bus had 50 seats, all of which were occupied. The traffic police, however, insisted that three seats with the number "0" could not be used, and fined the driver 300 yuan for overloading. The driver did not have the money, so the police confiscated his vehicle registration certificate. Now, our company pays over 3,000 yuan in various fines every month.

Third, some lawless elements are acting recklessly, threatening the safety of drivers and passengers. On October 15 last year, one of our company's drivers, Chen Fenbao, was driving a large bus from Xi'an to Baoji. When he reached Jinjiazhuang Village in Meixian County, eight young men blocked the road and forced their way onto the bus. One of them even placed a dagger on the driver's neck as a threat. On January 4 this year, one of our company's buses was attacked by five or six young men near Sizhu in Zhouzhi County. They smashed the car windows with bricks and bottles, injuring two passengers. The driver had to spend 18 yuan on treating the passengers and paid 70 yuan and 50 yuan respectively for their medical expenses. Since last year, six of our company's vehicles have had their windows smashed, one vehicle's body was stabbed with a dagger, and there have been 11 incidents of drivers being beaten.

### 行车难，乘车难，难在何处？

　　行车难，乘车难，难在何处？
    最近一个时期，公路运输部门反映“行车难”，旅客又叫“乘车难”。原因何在？就我公司情况而言，我认为有３个难点：
    一是汽油紧缺。仅去年后４个月，我公司就有１０００多辆（次）客货车因无油而被迫停驶，不仅影响了运输企业的经济效益，也给旅客乘车带来困难。
    二是滥设卡、滥罚款现象愈演愈烈。过去司机出车只要带上驾驶证、车辆行驶证和行车路单就可以了。现在司机出门却要带营运证、安全费证、经营许可证、线路审批证、进入其它地区的通行证等近２０个证件。就这样，有时检查人员还说证件不全，张口罚款十几元，几十元，有的甚至罚了款连票据也不开。去年１１月中旬，我公司宝鸡至甘肃西峰的两趟班车，被西峰工商所以无营业执照为由分别罚款７０元和４０元。我公司只有一个企业营业执照，不可能每个司机出车都带，可司机对这种罚款敢怒而不敢言。去年１１月１３日，我公司一辆从西安回宝鸡的班车在咸阳市防洪渠接受交通民警检查，这辆车共有５０个座位，刚好满员，交通民警却说，三个○号座位不能坐人，坐了就算超员，硬要罚司机３００元。司机没带钱，民警就将司机的行驶证扣了。现在，我公司每月支付各种罚款达３０００多元。
    三是一些不法分子胡作非为，威胁司乘人员安全。去年１０月１５日，我公司驾驶员陈奋宝驾驶大轿车从西安回宝鸡，行至眉县横渠金家庄村时，有８个青年站在路上拦挡，硬要上车。一个青年还拿出一把刺刀搁在驾驶员的脖子上进行威胁。今年１月４日，我公司一辆班车行至周至县司竹时，五六个青年用砖头、酒瓶砸碎了车窗玻璃，两位旅客受伤。司机除给旅客治伤花去１８元，又各付７０元和５０元医疗费。去年下半年以来，我公司有６辆车的玻璃被砸坏，１辆车的车壳被匕首扎破，司机被打事件就发生１１起。
