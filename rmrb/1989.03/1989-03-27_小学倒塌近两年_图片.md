An elementary school in Xiaodezi Village, Xubao Township, Hulan County, Heilongjiang Province, collapsed due to internal flooding on June 24, 1987. The school has not been rebuilt due to lack of funds, and students have been attending classes in the cramped, dilapidated homes and storage rooms of six local farmers for three consecutive semesters. The village originally had 200 students, but now only about 60 remain.

    黑龙江省呼兰县许堡乡小得子村小学校，自1987年6月24日校舍因内涝全部倒塌，一直无经费修建，学生连续三个学期分散在6户农民家窄小破旧的住房和仓库里上课。全村原有学生200名，目前只剩下60余名。王新林摄
