Xinhua News Agency, Washington, March 28th.

President Bush today dispatched the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Commander of the Coast Guard to Valdez, Alaska, to investigate the oil spill caused by a tanker running aground.

The amount of crude oil leaking from the Exxon Shipping Company's "Valdez" tanker has reached 10 million gallons, making it the largest oil spill in U.S. history.

Prior to this, safety investigators from the Department of Transportation had already begun investigating the cause of the accident.

According to reports, the ship's captain was not in the bridge at the time of the accident on the afternoon of the 24th, and the third mate, who was not certified by the Coast Guard, was at the helm. Both the harbor pilot and the Coast Guard officials detected the smell of alcohol on the captain's breath before and after the accident.
