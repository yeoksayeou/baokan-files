Edition: 4

A scholarly monthly magazine aimed at bridging the gap between architects and urban planners in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and overseas Chinese communities—“Architecture and Urban Planning”—has recently been published.

This magazine is sponsored by the Hong Kong Architecture and Urban Planning Publishing Company and co-sponsored by the Modern Chinese Architectural Design Research Group from the mainland, the “Housing Market” magazine from Taiwan, and the Macau Architects Association. It is reported that this is the first time that a professional magazine has been jointly established by Chinese from both sides of the Taiwan Strait and overseas.

The magazine aims to foster a platform for exchange and collaboration among architects and urban planners from different regions, promoting the development of architecture and urban planning in the Chinese-speaking world.
