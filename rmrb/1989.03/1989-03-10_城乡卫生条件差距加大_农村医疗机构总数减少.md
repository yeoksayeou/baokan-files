The gap in urban-rural health conditions widens
The number of rural medical institutions decreases

The national conference of health bureau directors, which opened today, revealed that in 1988, the number of hospitals in cities increased compared to 1987, while in rural areas, the number decreased relatively. There are as many as 93,000 villages without any medical facilities.

The reasons for this change are threefold: first, more hospitals are being built in cities than in rural areas; second, the faster economic development in cities has led to the construction of hospitals in cities ahead of and faster than in rural areas; third, adjustments in administrative divisions have resulted in an increase in the number of hospitals in cities.

　　城乡卫生条件差距加大
    农村医疗机构总数减少
    本报北京３月９日讯  记者艾笑报道：今天开幕的全国卫生厅局长会议披露，１９８８年我国医院数在城市比１９８７年增加，在农村则相对地减少了。无医疗点的村子高达９．３万个。
    这种变化原因有三：其一，在城市建设的医院多于农村；其二，城市经济发展较快，促使城市医院建设先于和快于农村；其三，行政区划的调整造成城市医院数的增加。
