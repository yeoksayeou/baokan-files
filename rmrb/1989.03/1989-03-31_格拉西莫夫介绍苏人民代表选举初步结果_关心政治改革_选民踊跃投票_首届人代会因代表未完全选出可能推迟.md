Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th.

The three-month-long election campaign for Soviet People's Representatives concluded on March 26 with nationwide voting. Although the official results will not be announced until April 5, preliminary data released over the past three days indicate that the election was largely successful.

Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Grishin announced at a press briefing on March 28 that approximately 80% of the party officials who ran in the election were successful, with only 20% failing to secure a seat. So far, it is known that the first secretaries of the party central committees of all the union republics have been elected as people's representatives, with only a few leaders failing to get elected. While many first secretaries of regional committees have been elected, several have not, notably the candidate member of the Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee and the first secretary of the Leningrad Regional Committee, Solovyov. This breaks the previous practice where mid-to-high-level officials were almost automatically elected as representatives.

Another notable feature of this election is the high voter turnout, with the majority of voters enthusiastically participating in the voting process, viewing it as an exercise of their right to participate in political reform. In many regions, the voter turnout was quite high, with most regions seeing turnout rates between 80% and 85%, and some regions reaching over 97%.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 29th.

The Central Election Commission of the Soviet People's Representatives announced today that re-elections will be held in 199 constituencies on May 14, and re-voting will take place in 76 constituencies before April 9. As a result, the first session of the Soviet People's Congress, originally scheduled for April 15, may be postponed.

According to a report by Soviet Central Television tonight, on March 26, elections were held in 1,497 out of 1,500 constituencies across the Soviet Union, resulting in the election of 1,225 people's representatives. In the earthquake-stricken areas of Armenia, three constituencies had less than half of the registered voters participating, necessitating re-elections. In 196 constituencies with only one or two candidates, none received more than half of the votes, requiring re-elections. Additionally, in 76 constituencies with three or more candidates, no one received more than half of the votes, necessitating re-voting between the top two candidates before April 9. Furthermore, the Soviet Academy of Sciences and other social organizations will elect an additional 18 representatives. This means that out of the 2,250 representatives that should have been elected so far, 293 are still yet to be elected.

　　格拉西莫夫介绍苏人民代表选举初步结果        
    关心政治改革　选民踊跃投票        
    首届人代会因代表未完全选出可能推迟
    新华社莫斯科３月２９日电  （记者沈法良）历时３月的苏联人民代表竞选活动，到３月２６日全国选民正式投票已告一段落。虽然全国选举的正式结果要到４月５日才公布，但从３天来已披露的初步材料看，这次选举基本上是成功的。
    苏联外交部发言人格拉西莫夫２８日在吹风会上宣布，这次选举中约有８０％参加竞选的党的工作人员当选，落选者仅占２０％。至今已知的各加盟共和国党中央的第一书记均当选为人民代表，只有少数领导人没有选上。在许多州委第一书记榜上有名的同时，也有不少人名落孙山，其中最引人注目的是苏共中央政治局候补委员、列宁格勒州委第一书记索洛维约夫。这就打破了过去中高级官员几乎全是当然代表的做法。
    此次选举的另一个特点是，大多数选民均踊跃参加投票，把它看作是行使自己参与政治改革的权利。不少地区投票率相当高，全国大多数地区都在８０％至８５％之间，有的地区达９７％以上。
    新华社莫斯科３月２９日电　苏联人民代表中央选举委员会今天宣布，今年５月１４日将在１９９个选区举行重新选举，４月９日以前在７６个选区进行重新投票。这样一来，原定于４月１５日召开的第一届苏联人民代表大会可能推迟在以后举行。
    据苏联中央电视台今晚报道，３月２６日，在全苏１５００个选区中，１４９７个选区举行了选举，共选出１２２５名人民代表。亚美尼亚地震灾区有３个选区投票的选民不到登记人数的一半，因而需要重选。１９６个选区虽只有１名或２名候选人，但均未获得超过半数的选票，也要进行重新选举。还有７６个选区有３个以上候选人，却无一人得到半数以上的选票，须在
  4月9日前对得票最多的前两名候选人进行重新投票。此外，苏联科学院和其他社会团体将补选出１８名代表。也就是说，迄今应选出的２２５０名代表中还有２９３名代表尚未选出。
