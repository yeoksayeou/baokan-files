Famous Mount Huangshan will greet the upcoming tourist season with a new look this year.

Currently, the tourist facilities at Huangshan have seen significant improvements. The Yupinglou Reservoir and the Xihai Reservoir, both with a total storage capacity of 80,000 cubic meters, are nearing completion. The sewage treatment plant in the Wenguan Scenic Area, capable of processing 3,000 tons of water daily, is ready to release water at any time. This means that the previously concerning issue of "Huangshan without water" will no longer be a problem. The opening of the Xihai Hotel, a joint venture between China and foreign partners, and the renovation of the Beihai Hotel will greatly alleviate the accommodation pressure in the Beihai area. Additionally, the Ciguangge Museum is actively preparing for its opening. This year, the mysterious scenic area from Diaoliao'an to Xihai, known as the "Devil's World," will also be open to tourists.

　　黄山新姿迎游客
    据新华社黄山３月２９日电  （记者朱云凤、纪成助）著名的黄山将以新的姿态迎接今年旅游旺季的到来。
    目前，黄山的旅游设施有了较大改善。总蓄水量达８万立方米的玉屏楼水库和西海水库即将竣工；日处理３０００吨水的温泉景区净水厂可随时开闸放水，这意味着曾使游客担忧的“黄山无水”状况将不再出现。中外合作兴建的西海饭店正式开业和北海宾馆的改造，可使北海住宿紧张的局面大大改观。此外，慈光阁博物馆正在积极筹备开放。从吊桥庵到西海这个被称之为“魔鬼世界”的神秘景区，今年也将向游客开放。
