In the mountains of the northern foothills of Shennongjia, there is a small town that is not particularly prominent—Fang County, Hubei Province, Qiaoshang Township. After a heavy snow in January 1989, we followed the county's living inspection team to this town and heard of an unusual event: this year's Spring Festival, every household in Dongcao Ping Village chose the same couplet. What was the reason behind this?

It turns out that Dongcao Ping Village is located at an altitude of 1,360 meters, with a frost-free period of only 150 days. Consequently, corn planted in the spring often does not mature before the early frost, forcing farmers to eat sour corn gruel all year round. The locals have a saying: “South Mountain Bridge Township, every household makes wooden barrels, not to hold rice or flour, but only to hold corn gruel.” In 1984, the county agricultural bureau implemented a science and technology poverty alleviation program, introducing the technology of covering the ground with plastic film. Initially, people were skeptical about the high yield of corn using this method. After one year, the trial-planted dozens of acres of corn not only matured but also had a high yield per acre. Seeing is believing, and in 1985, the villagers all followed suit. That year, they shed the 30-year-old burden of relying on rationed grain. Over the years, production has continued to develop. By 1988, the village's per capita grain production reached 503.5 kilograms, and diversified operations also began to develop. For this reason, this Spring Festival, all the villagers chose the same couplet: “Covering the ground with plastic film and selecting good seeds to achieve a per capita grain production of 1,000 kilograms, raising livestock and planting mushrooms to increase household income by 1,000 yuan,” with the horizontal scroll reading “Scientific Wealth.”

The promotion of corn ground covering technology ended the history of Bridge Township farmers eating sour corn gruel. Last year, despite a severe drought, the total grain production still increased by 16.7% compared to the previous year. Through practice, they realized: stubbornness makes it hard to get rich; to get rich, learn science. Last year, after hearing the news that the township was planning to build an adult cultural and technical school, the farmers managed to raise 73,000 yuan and handed it over to the township government. In the past few months, this school has held nine training classes, with 350 farmers learning practical technologies in agriculture, forestry, special crops, animal husbandry, and hydroelectric power.

### 为啥全村选中一副春联

　　为啥全村选中一副春联
    叶章胜　杜勇
    在神农架北麓峰峦叠嶂的群山中，有一个不太起眼的小乡——湖北省房县桥上乡。１９８９年元月一场大雪过后，我们随县生活检查组来到这个乡，听到了一桩奇事：今年春节，这个乡的东蒿坪村家家户户都选中了同一副春联。这是怎么回事呢？
    原来东蒿坪村海拔１３６０米，无霜期仅１５０天，因而春天播下的包谷往往到下早霜了也长不成熟，农民只好一年到头吃酸包谷浆。群众中流传着这样的顺口溜：“南山桥上乡，家家做木缸，不装米和面，只装包谷浆”。１９８４年，县农业局搞科技扶贫，来这里推广地膜覆盖技术。开头，人们对地膜覆盖玉米高产怎么也不相信。一年下来，试种的几十亩包谷不仅成熟了，而且单产相当高。庄稼人眼见为实，１９８５年群众都跟着学，当年就甩掉了３０多年吃供应粮的帽子。几年来，生产不断发展，到１９８８年，全村人均产粮５０３．５公斤，多种经营也跟着发展起来。为此，今年春节，全体村民都选中了同一幅春联：“盖地膜抓良种人均实现千斤粮，养家畜种香菌户平增收千元钱”，横额是“科学致富”。
    包谷地膜覆盖技术的推广，结束了桥上乡农民吃酸苞谷浆的历史。去年全乡虽遇大旱，粮食总产仍比上年增长１６．７％。实践中他们体会到：死脑筋，难得富；要得活，学科学。去年，农民得到乡里要筹建成人文化技术学校的消息后，硬是凑出了７．３万元，交给乡政府。几个月来，这所学校已举办各类培训班９期，有３５０名农民在这里学习了农业、林、特、畜牧、水电等实用技术。
