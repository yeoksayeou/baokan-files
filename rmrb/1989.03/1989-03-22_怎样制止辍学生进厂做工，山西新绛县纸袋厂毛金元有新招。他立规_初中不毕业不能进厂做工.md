How to prevent dropouts from working in factories, the Xingyang County Paper Bag Factory's Mao Jinyuan has a new strategy. He has established a rule—those who have not graduated from junior high school cannot work in the factory.

The causes of the "new theory of reading being useless" are multifaceted. Some students and parents' impatience for quick gains and focus on immediate money are major reasons for students dropping out. Students have multiple avenues to earn money. In cities, they can set up small stalls or run businesses, while in rural areas, some work the land, some run businesses, and many more seek jobs in township and private enterprises through connections. This requires the whole society to work together, do a good job of educating parents and students, and plug some loopholes. The manager of the Beixiangma Paper Bag Factory in Xingyang County, Mao Jinyuan, to cut off the channels for students dropping out of school, established a factory rule: those who have not graduated from junior high school or are under 16 years old cannot work in the factory, causing more than 20 school-age youths to return to school.

The Beixiangma Paper Bag Factory is a private enterprise. Under Mao Jinyuan's management, the factory's annual output value reaches over 2 million yuan. Nearly 200 people work in this factory, with an average monthly salary of 100 yuan, and some earning over 200 yuan. The students' parents in this village saw this and wanted their children to drop out of school and work in the factory to earn money early. Some students, burdened by their studies, also had the idea of leaving school to work. Last autumn, more than 10 students in this village dropped out of school, and some parents came to Mao Jinyuan's door, requesting to work in the factory.

Mao Jinyuan is a young man who has worked as a private school teacher for 7 years. From his experience in running the factory, he drew an important conclusion: whether in management or work, knowledge is needed. With knowledge, one can be perceptive and efficient. Therefore, he thought about cultivating and educating the next generation, rejecting the requests from parents seeking jobs for their students, and advised them not to be influenced by the idea that "reading is not as good as earning money." This year, as soon as spring arrived, Mao Jinyuan established a new rule. He said: "One should not ruin a child's future for a few yuan. Without education, no matter what one does in the future, one will suffer."

　　怎样制止辍学生进厂做工，山西新绛县纸袋厂毛金元有新招。他立规——        
    初中不毕业不能进厂做工
    山西新绛县  梁冬
    造成“新的读书无用论”的原因是多方面的，一些学生和家长的急功近利、抓现钱的思想是学生辍学的一条主要原因。学生抓现钱的门路是多渠道的，在城市可以摆小摊，跑买卖，在农村有的种地，有的跑买卖，而更多的则是想通过关系在乡镇企业和个体企业做工。这就要求全社会齐抓共管，做好家长和学生的思想工作，堵塞一些漏洞。山西新绛县北王马纸袋厂厂长毛金元为切断在校学生流失的渠道，立下一道厂规：初中不毕业、不满１６岁的少年不能进厂做工，使２０多名学龄少年重返学校。
    北王马纸袋厂是一家私营企业。这个厂在毛金元的经营下，年产值达２００多万元。在这个厂从业的近２００人，月工资平均１００元，有的高达２００多元。这个村的学生家长看了眼红，想让孩子辍学进厂早挣钱，有的学生因学业负担过重，也产生了离校做工的念头。去年秋季，这个村就有１０余名学生辍学，有的家长登门找毛金元，要求进厂做工。
    毛金元是个干过７年民办教师的年轻人。他从办厂实践中得出一条很重要的结论：无论经营和做工都需要知识，有知识就能耳聪目明，事半功倍。因此，他从培养教育下一代着想，对来给学生找工作的家长，一一拒绝，并劝他们不要受“读书不如挣现钱”的思想影响。今年一开春，毛金元就立下了新规矩。他说：“不能为几个钱毁了孩子一辈子，没有文化，以后不管干啥都要吃苦头。”
