	The reporter Zhang Zhen Guo recently heard and saw in various parts of Anhui Province that the printing and distribution of textbooks for primary and secondary schools in the province have three major problems: poor printing quality, late delivery, and excessive quantities.

	These textbooks not only use poor-quality paper but also have many pages missing, misplaced, blank, or with typographical errors. In some schools in Qianshan County, the rate of defective textbooks is as high as 8%, and they are not allowed to be returned or exchanged.

	Many days after the start of the new semester, primary and secondary schools in Wangjiang and Huaining counties still have not received textbooks for several core subjects. Many teachers fear that the phenomenon of "the semester is almost over, but the books have not arrived" will happen again this year.

	Bookstores in Susong, Zongyang, and Taihu counties only care about making money. They force students to buy practice books that students do not want, otherwise, they will not provide the textbooks. In Zongyang County, the textbook fee for senior high school liberal arts students at Baiyun Middle School was 28 yuan in the previous autumn, but it increased to 70 yuan this year. The total textbook fee for the entire school in Tongling Middle School in Susong County last year was double that of the previous year. Out of the 30 books each student bought, half were forced upon them.

	The excessive number of books has become a problem. Teachers say it is difficult to teach, and students say their book bags are too heavy. In these counties, which are mostly poor, many students have already dropped out of school because they cannot afford to buy books.

    纸差书残  谬误百出
    开学多日　课本未到
    硬性搭配　书多成灾
    安徽中小学教材
    差迟滥
    本报合肥３月１０日电　记者张振国日前在安徽各地耳闻目睹：该省中小学课本印刷发行存在三大问题——印刷差，到校迟，数量滥。
    这些课本不仅纸张差，缺页、倒装、白页、错字、漏字也很多。潜山县一些学校课本的残书率高达８％左右，而且不准退，也无书换。
    新学期开学多日，望江、怀宁等县中小学仍有多门主课课本未到。很多老师生怕再次出现去年“学期已快完，书还未到齐”的怪现象。
    宿松、枞阳、太湖等县的书店只顾赚钱，学生不愿买的练习册，也硬性搭配。否则，就不供课本。枞阳县白云中学前年秋季高中文科生书费为２８元，去年涨到７０元。宿松县铜铃中学去年全校书费比前年涨了两倍。每个学生所买３０种书，有一半是搭配的。
    书多成灾。老师说不好教，学生说书包重。因这些县大都很穷，为买不起书离校者已有多人。
