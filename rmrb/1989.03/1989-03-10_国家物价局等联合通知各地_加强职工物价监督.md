Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 9th.

The State Price Bureau, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the Ministry of Finance recently issued a joint notice, urging local authorities to strengthen the supervision and inspection of workers' prices.

The _notice_ points out that the workers' price supervision stations in various cities, especially large and medium-sized cities, should organize forces to strengthen regular patrols and inspections of market prices. The focus of these inspections should be on the prices of daily industrial consumer goods and sideline food products that are closely related to the lives of urban residents, as well as the charging standards for catering, services, and repair industries. Additionally, the prices and charging standards of commodities in collective markets should be monitored. For clues related to the illegal resale and price gouging of important production materials and scarce consumer goods, workers' price supervision organizations should actively report to the price inspection departments and assist professional inspection departments in handling such cases.

According to statistics from relevant departments, 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have already carried out workers' price supervision activities. Currently, there are more than 11,000 workers' price supervision stations nationwide.
