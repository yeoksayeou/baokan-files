Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. This old problem still requires deepened understanding today.

Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. Although this is an old problem, it is still very necessary to deepen the understanding of it under new historical conditions. It cannot be assumed that since China's industry has developed significantly, people's lives have improved markedly, and farmers' incomes have improved significantly, the grain problem is no longer important. On the contrary, with the development of the economy, the increase in population, and the gradual improvement of people's living standards, the demand for grain will only increase. If the grain problem cannot be solved well, then all other problems will be difficult to address.

Since the rural reforms, China's grain production has increased significantly, but the supply-demand contradiction has intensified, and the momentum for production has weakened. A per capita grain possession of 400 kilograms is an objective basis that cannot be ignored in formulating economic and social development strategies.

The first severe situation facing grain production is the intensifying supply-demand contradiction. This is manifested in the slow increase in grain production and supply, while grain consumption and demand are growing too fast.

China's grain production reached a new level in 1984 but then showed signs of stagnation. The reasons are multifaceted, but one important factor is the lack of clear recognition of the foundational role of grain production, leading to some policy mistakes. Faced with China's continuous six-year grain surplus after 1978, there was a tendency to be overly optimistic about the grain production situation. In 1984, when there was a temporary difficulty in selling grain, no measures were taken to stabilize the market, and instead, hundreds of billions of kilograms of stored grain were sold at low prices, subsidies were canceled, investment and the supply of agricultural production materials were reduced, seriously dampening farmers' enthusiasm for grain production. In recent years, the prices of agricultural production materials have risen, the internal comparative benefits of agriculture have changed, and coupled with the impact of natural disasters, farmers' enthusiasm for grain production has further declined, affecting the normal development of grain production.

At the same time, the total grain consumption in society has shown abnormal growth in recent years. Based on the high base in 1984, the consumption volume has exceeded the total production volume for several consecutive years. Among these, the growth in urban and rural residents' staple food consumption has been rapid, with an increase of over 100 billion kilograms in 1987 compared to 1984; the growth in meat, poultry, and egg consumption has also significantly increased the amount of grain consumed, with per capita consumption of pork increasing by 11.7%, poultry by 26.7%, and fresh eggs by 42.2% in 1987 compared to 1984, requiring an additional several tens of billions of kilograms of grain; especially the consumption of alcoholic beverages has grown remarkably, with a 59.3% increase in 1987 compared to 1984. Calculating based on China's production of 431 million tons of white liquor and 540 million tons of beer in 1987, it is estimated that about 200 billion kilograms of grain were consumed, far exceeding the annual grain increase.

The rapid growth in grain consumption and demand is related to the significant increase in residents' monetary income levels, changes in dietary structure, and natural population growth in recent years. It is also related to the lack of policy guidance on grain consumption. Currently, China implements a low-price unified distribution policy for grain, which not only widens the gap between purchase and sale prices, further increasing the financial burden on the state, but also, to some extent, encourages grain consumption, especially the overgrowth of grain-based processing industries.

The second severe situation facing grain production is the lack of momentum for development. This is mainly reflected in the strengthening of factors constraining grain production development. First, the area of arable land is continuously decreasing, and there is little room to expand the area of grain cultivation. In 1987, the area of arable land decreased by 51.25 million mu compared to 1980, with per capita arable land decreasing from 1.5 mu in 1980 to 1.33 mu in 1987, and the trend of continuous decrease in arable land is difficult to reverse. Second, agricultural infrastructure is aging, and the ability to resist natural disasters is weakening. Third, agricultural investment is decreasing, with agricultural construction investment in the Sixth Five-Year Plan period decreasing by 29.8% compared to the Fifth Five-Year Plan period, and still relatively low in the past two to three years. Fourth, the development of agricultural-related industries is slow, and the supply of agricultural production materials is becoming tight. Fifth, agricultural science and technology are weak and cannot meet the needs of development.

Additionally, the decline in the comparative benefits of grain production and the difficulty in mobilizing farmers' enthusiasm for grain production will also affect the momentum for grain increase. In recent years, the internal price ratio of agricultural products has changed significantly, with the returns from grain production being significantly lower than from other crops; the price increases of agricultural production materials are too large, and coupled with the decreasing returns on investment, the marginal benefits of grain production have significantly decreased; with the adjustment and changes in the rural industrial structure, grain production is less profitable than non-agricultural industries such as wage labor, commerce, and transportation. If this situation is not changed soon, it will seriously affect the long-term development of grain production.

Ensuring grain increase and bumper harvests in the next few years to increase supply; formulating correct consumption policies to guide consumption and suppress demand, is the urgent task to solve the grain problem.

Reversing the trend of intensifying grain supply-demand contradictions is the urgent task to solve the grain problem. Due to the long-term and arduous nature of the grain problem, solving the grain contradiction should be approached from a long-term perspective and implemented immediately, and the continuous expansion of the current grain supply-demand contradiction cannot be allowed. Only by relieving the grain tension in the near term can we stabilize public sentiment, smoothly implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, curb overheating of the economy, suppress demand, and create conditions for the further development of grain production.

To solve the grain problem in the near term, measures should be taken from both the supply and demand sides. Not only should the bumper harvests of grain in the next two years be ensured to increase the supply of grain, but correct consumption policies should also be formulated to guide grain consumption and suppress grain demand.

In terms of increasing grain supply, the following policy measures should be taken: First, appropriately raise the contract purchase price of grain, but considering the need to control the significant increase in prices, the price increase should not be too large; second, strengthen the management of agricultural production materials, reduce the exploitation of farmers by intermediaries, and appropriately strengthen the agricultural production materials supply department to ensure the smooth supply of agricultural production materials; third, increase the amount of fertilizer linked to grain contract purchases, change the shortcomings of seasonal and scattered supply in the "three-linkages," and issue tickets to farmers in proportion to the amount of grain purchased at the time of signing the contract, ensuring timely supply; fourth, cancel the "discussion and transfer to planned" grain purchase task for farmers, and liberalize the prices of grain outside the contract purchase, allowing farmers to operate independently and encouraging farmers to produce more; fifth, improve the method of agricultural tax collection, reduce the tax burden on grain fields, and reduce taxation as the amount of contracted grain delivered increases, while increasing agricultural tax collection on economic crop fields to stabilize the area of grain cultivation; sixth, each region should adopt the form of "industry supporting agriculture" according to its own situation, narrow the horizontal interest gap in grain production, and provide more subsidies to grain farmers. In summary, in the near term, every effort should be made to protect the interests of grain farmers, mobilize the production enthusiasm of grain farmers, and strive for stable grain production.

Additionally, to make up for the current grain supply-demand gap, it is also necessary to appropriately import more grain, but the import of grain should be timely and in appropriate quantities, mainly used to supplement buffer stocks and adjust varieties. From a cost-benefit perspective, importing grain is not as cost-effective as importing more fertilizer. At the same time, measures should be taken to eliminate the regional divisions between surplus grain areas and grain-deficient areas, strengthen grain circulation and adjustment, which will also have a certain effect in relieving grain supply tension.

In terms of suppressing grain demand, correct consumption policies should be formulated to ensure that the growth of grain demand is in line with the growth of grain supply. Specific measures should be taken to adjust the consumption of food grain, industrial grain, and especially grain used in production according to specific situations.

The way to enhance the momentum of grain production lies in reform. The fundamental issue is to protect and stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for grain production, for which a series of coordinated policy measures should be taken.

Maintaining the long-term stable development of grain production is an important strategic decision for China, for which a series of corresponding coordinated policy measures should be taken to enhance the momentum of grain production.

First, a large amount of investment in agriculture is needed. Agricultural investment should not be mainly reliant on state and collective investment as before, nor should it be mainly reliant on farmers' own accumulation as in recent years. Agricultural investment should be divided into three parts: First, state investment, mainly used for large-scale water conservancy projects, large-scale commercial grain bases, and large-scale agricultural land development projects with strategic significance; second, local and rural collective investment, mainly used for agricultural infrastructure construction, including agricultural land, water conservancy, plant protection, and science and technology projects; third, farmers' investment, mainly used for agricultural production materials, soil improvement, and increased production and income.

The sources of funds for agricultural investment should be diversified, and corresponding policies should be adopted to attract and encourage collective and farmers to increase investment, and local governments should also explore ways to raise funds to increase investment in agriculture. In the future, the proportion of agricultural investment in the state financial budget should be appropriately increased, and a certain proportion of extra-budgetary funds at all levels should be allocated to agriculture. Banks should appropriately increase loans to agriculture and include them in the credit plan, ensuring their implementation. Agricultural construction should also focus on attracting foreign investment, and a portion of the World Bank's concessional loans should be allocated to agricultural projects. Additionally, the method of horizontal cooperation can be adopted to encourage grain-deficient areas to invest in grain-producing areas to establish bases, exchanging grain. At the same time, the development of fertilizer, agricultural film, pesticide, and agricultural machinery industries should be accelerated to increase the supply of agricultural production materials and material input.

Second, the role of agricultural science and technology should be fully utilized. Agricultural science and technology should be strengthened, and scientific farming should be actively promoted, adopting new varieties and technologies to promote the development of grain production.

Third, while protecting existing arable land, agricultural development should be actively promoted. Legal, economic, and administrative measures should be adopted to stop the illegal occupation of arable land, further improve the arable land occupation tax system, and impose heavy taxes on the occupation of arable land, implementing this policy as a major strategy. At the same time, wasteland, barren mountains, barren waters, barren beaches, and tidal flats should be actively developed and utilized, developing vertical agriculture, reducing the competition for land between grain and economic crops, and making limited arable land more effectively used for grain production.

Fourth, the rural economic system reform should be further deepened. First, the rural operation should be continued and improved, the household contract responsibility system should be improved, socialized services should be strengthened, and the development of various types and forms of rural economic organizations should be encouraged. Second, in regions with conditions, appropriate scale management can be implemented, gradually transferring rural surplus labor through the development of township enterprises and other economic organizations, concentrating land in the hands of skilled farmers, and considering the adoption of leasing methods to encourage the transfer of land. Third, in the long term, the system of land transfer should be explored, and through the paid transfer of land management rights under the state's macro-control, the scale management of grain production should be achieved, and the commercial rate of grain should be improved.

Fifth, in macro-management, the long-term development of grain production should be emphasized. First, the grain management system should be continuously improved, and the production, processing, and sales should be unified and operated in an integrated manner, changing the system where grain production is managed by the agricultural department, and procurement, processing, and circulation are managed by the financial and commercial departments, so that the production, processing, and sales of grain are unified and managed by one department, strengthening the guiding role of the state plan. Second, a grain reserve adjustment system should be established, a grain price stabilization fund should be set up, and the storage and transportation infrastructure should be strengthened. When the market price of grain is too low, the state should "buy in" at a reasonable protection price, and when the market price is too high, the state should "sell out" at a reasonable price, balancing the market price, and protecting the interests of producers and consumers. The state should set up a regulatory department above enterprises to undertake this task. At the same time, the grain crop insurance system should be improved to truly eliminate the worries of grain farmers. Third, the redistribution of national income should be reasonably adjusted through accumulation, consumption, taxation, price, interest, subsidies, and other means to protect the interests of grain production and operation. In rural areas, the policy of "industry supporting agriculture" and "special supporting grain" should be implemented to narrow the interest gap between grain production and other crop production and non-agricultural industries; in the whole society, the gap between urban and rural areas should be gradually narrowed, changing the practice of "rural areas supporting cities," so that the interests of agriculture and industry, urban and rural areas are mutually beneficial and promote each other, maintaining the long-term stable development of grain production, and serving the modernization of China's socialist construction.

　　谈谈我国的粮食问题
    ●粮食的地位还重要吗？●怎样看待当前面临的粮食局势？
    ●解决粮食问题的近期措施是什么？●怎样谋求粮食生产的长期稳定发展？
             孙国华
    农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础，这个老问题今天仍有深化认识之必要。
    农业是国民经济的基础，粮食是基础的基础，这虽然是个老问题，但在新的历史条件下，进一步深化认识仍十分必要。不能认为，我国工业有了很大发展，人民生活有了显著提高，农民收入明显改善，粮食问题就不重要了。相反，随着经济的发展、人口的增加和人民生活水平的逐步提高，对粮食的需求将会越来越多，如果不能较好地解决粮食问题，其它一切问题将都无从谈起。
    农村改革以来，我国粮食产量有很大增加，但供需矛盾加剧，生产后劲不足。人均四百公斤粮食占有量，是制定经济社会发展战略不可忽视的客观依据。
    粮食生产面临的第一个严峻局势是，粮食供需矛盾不断加剧。表现为粮食的生产和粮食的供给增加缓慢，而粮食的消费和粮食的需求增长过快。
    我国的粮食生产在１９８４年登上新台阶后出现了新的徘徊。其原因是多方面的，其中很重要的一条是由于对粮食生产的基础地位认识不清，政策上出现了某些失误。面对我国自１９７８年以后的连续６年粮食超常增长，某种程度上产生了对粮食生产形势估计过于乐观。１９８４年一时出现卖粮难，在政策上没有采取措施平抑市场波动，反而低价抛售了几百亿斤存粮，取消补贴，减少资金投入和农业生产资料供应，严重挫伤了农民的种粮积极性。近几年农业生产资料涨价，农业内部比较利益发生变化，加上自然灾害的影响，农民种粮积极性进一步下降，影响了粮食生产的正常发展。
    与此同时，近几年社会粮食消费总量却出现超常增长。在１９８４年的高基数上，社会消费量连续几年超过生产总量，其中城乡居民口粮的增长很快，１９８７年比１９８４年增加了１００多亿公斤；肉禽蛋消费的增长增加消费粮食的数量也很大，１９８７年与１９８４年相比，人均消费猪肉增加１１．７％，家禽增加２６．７％，鲜蛋增加４２．２％，为此要多消费粮食几十亿公斤；特别是酒类的消费增长十分惊人，１９８７年比１９８４年增长５９．３％，按１９８７年我国生产白酒４３１万吨、啤酒５４０万吨计算，需要消耗粮食２００亿公斤左右，大大超过当年粮食的增产数量。
    粮食消费和需求的增长如此之快，与近几年居民货币收入水平的大幅度提高、膳食结构发生变化以及人口的自然增长等方面有关，同时也有政策上对粮食消费引导不够的原因。目前我国对粮食实行低价统销政策，不仅购销倒挂的进一步扩大，不断加重国家财政负担，而且在某种意义上鼓励了粮食消费，特别是以粮食为原料的加工业的过快增长。
    粮食生产面临的第二个严峻局势是，粮食生产发展后劲不足。这突出表现在制约粮食生产发展的因素在强化。一是耕地面积不断减少，扩大粮食种植面积的余地很小。１９８７年耕地面积比１９８０年减少５１２５万亩，人均耕地由１９８０年的１．５亩减少到１９８７年的１．３３亩，而且耕地面积继续减少的趋势难以扭转。二是农业基础设施老化，抗御自然灾害能力减弱。三是农业资金投入减少，农业基建投资“六五”时期比“五五”时期减少２９．８％，近两三年仍然较少。四是农用工业发展缓慢，农业生产资料供应趋于紧张。五是农业科技力量薄弱，不能适应发展的需要。
    此外，粮食生产的比较利益下降，农民种粮积极性难以调动起来，也将影响粮食的增产后劲。近几年农产品内部比价发生了较大变化，种粮的收益明显低于种其它作物；农业生产资料涨价幅度过大，加上投资收益趋于递减，使种粮的边际效益明显下降；随着农村产业结构的调整变化，种粮不如务工、经商、运输等非农产业收入高。这种状况如不尽快改变，必将严重影响粮食生产的长期发展。
    确保近几年粮食增产丰收，增加供给；制定正确的消费政策，引导消费，抑制需求，是解决粮食问题的当务之急。
    扭转当前粮食供需矛盾不断剧化的趋势，是解决粮食问题的当务之急。由于粮食问题的长期性和艰巨性，解决粮食矛盾应从长远着眼、近处着手，决不能听任当前粮食供需矛盾的继续扩大。只有在近期内缓解粮食的紧张状况，才能安定民心，顺利执行党的十三届三中全会精神，克服过热的经济，抑制需求，为粮食生产的进一步发展创造条件。
    解决近期内的粮食问题，应从供、需两个方面同时采取措施，不仅要确保今明两年的粮食增产丰收，努力增加粮食的供给，而且要制定正确的消费政策，引导粮食消费，抑制粮食需求。
    在增加粮食供给方面需要采取的政策措施，一是适当提高粮食合同订购价格，但考虑到控制物价大幅度上涨的需要，提价幅度不能太大；二是加强对农业生产资料的管理，减少中间环节对农民的盘剥，同时适当加强农资供应部门的力量，确保农资供应渠道的畅通；三是增加化肥同粮食合同订购的挂钩数量，改变“三挂钩”中分季供应、零星分散的弊端，应在签订合同时按收购粮食数量按比例发给农民票证，并保证及时供应；四是取消对农民的“议转平”粮食收购任务，合同订购以外的粮食价格放开，由农民自主经营，鼓励农民超产多收；五是改进农业税计征办法，减轻粮田的税负，并随交售定购粮食的增加而减少征税，同时要增加对种植经济作物田的农业税收，以稳定粮食种植面积；六是各地要根据自身的情况，采取以工补农的形式，缩小种粮的横向利益差距，多给粮农补贴。总之，近期内应千方百计保护粮农利益，调动粮农的生产积极性，争取粮食生产的稳定增产。
    此外，为弥补当前粮食的供需缺口，适当多进口一点粮食也是必要的，但进口粮食应适时适量，主要用于增补缓冲库存和品种调剂，从效益比较看，进口粮食不如多进口化肥合算。同时要采取措施消除余粮区和缺粮区之间的地区分割，加强粮食流通和调剂，这对缓解粮食供应紧张也有一定作用。
    在抑制粮食需求方面，需要制定正确的消费政策，在保证吃饱的前提下，使粮食需求的增长与粮食供给的增长相适应。对生活用粮、生产用粮，特别是工业用粮，要根据具体情况采取具体措施加以调节。
    增强粮食生产后劲出路在于改革。根本问题是保护和激发农民的种粮积极性，为此要采取一系列配套的政策措施。
    保持粮食生产的长期稳定发展，是我国重要的战略决策，为此需要采取一系列相应配套的政策措施，增强粮食生产后劲。
    首先，需要大量增加对农业的投入。农业投入既不能像以前那样，主要靠国家和集体投资，也不能像近几年这样，主要靠农民自身的积累。农业投入应分为三部分：一是国家投入，主要用于大江大河治理、大型商品粮基地建设和大面积的农田基本建设等具有战略意义的开发建设项目；二是地方和农村集体投入，主要用于农业基础设施建设，包括农田、水利、植保、科技等方面的项目；三是农民投入，主要用于农业生产资料、改良土壤地力、增产增收等方面的经营性项目。
    农业投入的资金来源应当是多渠道的，要采取相应的政策吸引、鼓励集体和农民多增加投入，地方也要多想办法筹集资金增加对农业的投入。以后国家财政预算中要相应提高农业投资的比重，各级预算外资金也要提取一定比例用于农业，银行对农业的贷款要适当增加，并列入信贷计划，切实予以保证。农业建设还需重视吸引外资，世界银行的优惠贷款要安排一部分农业项目。此外，还可实行横向联合的办法，鼓励缺粮地区到产粮区投资办基地，用以调换粮食。同时，要加快化肥、农膜、农药、农机工业的发展，增加农业生产资料的供应和物质投入。
    其次，发挥农业科技的作用。要加强农业科技力量，积极推广科学种田，采用新品种、新技术，促进粮食生产发展。
    第三，在保护现有耕地的同时，积极推进农业开发。要采取法律、经济、行政手段，制止滥占耕地，进一步完善耕地占用税制度，对占用耕地要课以重税并把此项政策作为重大战略加以实施。在此同时，积极开发利用荒地、荒山、荒水、荒滩、海涂等资源，发展立体农业，减少粮经争地，使有限的耕地更多、更好地用于粮食生产。
    第四，进一步深化农村经济体制改革。一是继续推行和完善农村的经营，完善家庭联产承包责任制，搞好社会化服务，鼓励发展多种成分、多种形式的农村经济组织。二是有条件的地区，可以实行适度的规模经营，通过发展乡镇企业和其它经济组织逐步转移农村剩余劳力，把土地集中到种田能手手里，退出的土地也可考虑采取租借办法鼓励出让。三是从远期看要探索农村土地转让制度，在国家的宏观控制下，有组织、有计划地通过土地经营权的有偿流动，达到粮食生产的规模经营，提高粮食的商品率。
    第五，在宏观管理上要重视粮食生产的长期发展。一是不断完善粮食管理体制，实行生产、加工、销售的统一管理和一体化经营，改变粮食生产由农业部门管理，收购、加工、流通由财贸部门统管的相互制约体制，使粮食的生产、加工、销售统一由一个部门管理，强化国家计划的指导作用。二是建立粮食储备调节体系，设立粮食平准基金，加强储运基础设施，当粮食市场价格过低时，国家按合理的保护价“吞进”，当市场价格过高时，国家按合理价格“吐出”，以丰补歉，平抑市场价格，保护生产者和消费者的利益。国家要设立高于企业的调节部门来承担这一任务。同时要完善粮食作物的保险制度，确实消除粮农的后顾之忧。三是合理调整国民收入的再分配，通过积累、消费、税收、价格、利息、补贴等方式，保护粮食生产和经营者的利益。在农村，要坚持实行以工补农、以特补粮措施，缩小粮食生产与其它作物生产及非农产业部门的利益差距；在全社会，逐步缩小城乡差别，改变“农村支援城市”的做法，使工农之间、城乡之间互利互惠，互相促进，保持粮食生产的长期稳定发展，为我国的社会主义现代化建设服务。
