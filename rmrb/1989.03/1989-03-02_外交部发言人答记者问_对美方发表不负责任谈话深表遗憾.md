Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Responds to Questions from Reporters: Deeply Regrets Irresponsible Remarks by the U.S.

New China News Agency, Beijing, March 1st - The spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry today responded to a reporter's question regarding the U.S. government's remarks on February 28th about Fang Lizhi not attending President Bush's dinner. The spokesperson expressed surprise and deep regret over the "irresponsible remarks" made by the U.S.

The spokesperson stated, "On February 26th, President Bush held a dinner for the Chinese leadership. Prior to this, the U.S. side did not consult with the Chinese side, bypassed normal channels, and issued invitations to individuals that the Chinese side could not accept. This unilateral action can only be seen as support for those individuals and disrespect for the host country. From the beginning, the Chinese side has made multiple serious representations to the U.S. side, and the U.S. side expressed a willingness to seek a solution. Now, however, the U.S. side has made irresponsible remarks again. We are surprised and deeply regret this."

    外交部发言人答记者问
    对美方发表不负责任谈话深表遗憾
    新华社北京三月一日电　中国外交部发言人今天在回答记者提问时就美国官方二月二十八日再次就方励之未出席布什总统的晚宴事发表的谈话作出评论，对美方“不负责任的谈话”“感到惊讶并深表遗憾”。
    发言人说，“二月二十六日布什总统为中国领导人举行宴会。美方在此之前不同中方商量，绕开正常渠道，向个别中方不能接受的人发出邀请，这种强加于人的做法只能被理解为是对这种人的支持和对东道国的不尊重。中方从一开始就向美方进行了多次严正交涉，美方作了愿意寻求解决办法的表示，现在却又发表不负责任的谈话，我们感到惊讶并深表遗憾。”
