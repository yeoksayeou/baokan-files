A financial enterprise dedicated to serving the development of higher education and science and technology has garnered significant attention in the financial sector of Hunan Province. This credit cooperative, established by six universities including Hunan University of Finance and Economics, National University of Defense Technology, and Hunan University, has been hailed by experts as the embryonic form of an "education bank."

The Longsha High Education Credit Cooperative, approved for establishment, primarily aims to leverage universities and related enterprises, using capital as a medium, to promote the integration of science and technology with production. This will enhance the self-development capabilities of universities, accelerate technological development, and revitalize university-run enterprises within the system. This financial institution will also establish a student award fund and a mid-career and young faculty research award fund, gradually forming the unique characteristics of an "education bank."

It is reported that this is the first instance of multiple universities jointly establishing a credit cooperative.
