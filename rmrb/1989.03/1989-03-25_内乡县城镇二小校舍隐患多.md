The school buildings of Nixiang County Town Second Primary School have numerous hazards. The school has 20 classes, 1,431 students, and 71 teachers, with a total of 78 classrooms. Among these, 12 classrooms leak during rain, 24 classrooms have walls that are collapsing at the base, and 4 classrooms have walls with visible cracks. Through the cracks in the wall of the third-grade classroom, one can see the activities of students outside. Additionally, 10 rooms used as both teacher offices and dormitories, as well as the back walls of 4 student restrooms throughout the school, also have cracks. These hazards pose a serious psychological burden on both teachers and students.

On August 18th of last year, the school principal wrote a report to the county committee and the county government, detailing this situation. However, there has been no response to date.

　　内乡县城镇二小校舍隐患多
    内乡县城镇第二小学有２０个班级，１４３１名学生，７１名教师，校舍７８间。其中有１２间校舍漏雨，有２４间校舍墙脚塌陷，有４个教室的墙壁出现裂缝，通过二年级三班教室的墙壁裂缝，能看到室外学生的活动情况。作为教师办公室兼宿舍的１０间屋子的墙壁和全校４个学生厕所的后墙也都出现了裂缝。危房隐患给师生带来严重的思想负担。
    去年８月１８日，这所学校的校长向县委、县政府写了报告，反映了这一情况，可是迟迟没有回音。
