	The "Button Effect" Explained
	Yu Qing

	What happens if you button your shirt wrong? You end up with a mismatched length, and the only way to fix it is to unbutton all the buttons that are in the wrong holes and rebutton them in the correct order. Otherwise, no matter how nicely you button the rest, it still looks awkward.

	This is a simple piece of everyday knowledge that doesn't need commenting on. However, if in the process of economic development and reform, a "wrong button" appears, the consequences can be very serious. Especially when correcting a single mistake requires a lot of rework, it can lead to enormous losses.

	Over the past decade of reform and opening up, economists have conducted thorough analyses of the flaws in China's economic system. In summary, issues like the "iron rice bowl," "big pot of rice," and "denying the law of value" are all "wrong buttons" in economic life. If these problems are not addressed, any patchwork solutions will be futile efforts after the first button is misaligned. Such radical reform rhetoric, though it may seem extreme, hits the nail on the head.

	Since the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee proposed the rectification policy, people have noticed that controlling the scale of construction and curbing economic overheating have become the focus of work for party committees and governments at all levels. However, some comrades have raised the point: "In the past few years, we have been working to control the scale of fixed asset investment, but due to the flaws of the old system where investment is like a big pot of rice, the scale just can't be controlled." This touches on the relationship between rectification and reform. Metaphorically speaking, without unbuttoning the "wrong buttons" of the old system, rectification and management will find it hard to go deep.

	For instance, China's agriculture has been stagnant for four consecutive years. How to break through this stagnation? People from all walks of life are thinking about it. The most concentrated view is that for a long time, grain prices have been too low, and the comparative benefits of growing grain are very poor. If growing grain doesn't yield good profits, how can farmers' enthusiasm be stimulated? Only by following the law of value and reforming the unreasonable price system can agriculture possibly reach a new level. Relying on administrative mobilization and persuading farmers to invest more in agriculture will not fundamentally work. This actually reflects the "button effect" of the old system.

	The "button effect" has caused us too much pain. The longer we delay in fundamentally correcting the "wrong buttons," the more we will encounter a series of "negative effects," and the greater the losses will be when we have to rework later. This perhaps explains from the opposite side why reform in China can obtain the support of the vast majority of people, and why so many people are eager for reform.

	However, identifying the problem is only the beginning of solving it. The real issue is how to correct the mistakes.

	If we want a quick fix, we can boldly address the root cause. For example, since we need to follow the law of value, why not release all prices at once, whether it's firewood, rice, oil, salt, or steel, coal, and crude oil, let the market determine the prices. But can the people, who need to eat and wear clothes, bear it? Can the factories that consume raw materials bear it? We can't just ignore this. If we insist on "correcting the buttons" all at once, it might be quick, but it could cause big problems for the national economy and social stability.

	It's like a weak patient whose shirt is buttoned wrong. To fix the shirt, if we suddenly unbutton all the buttons, exposing the chest to the cold wind, it could lead to two outcomes: either the clothes are instantly in order, or the patient collapses and can't get up again.

	Any analogy is flawed. Here, I just want to illustrate that in a developing country like China, where there are many deep-seated problems, implementing reform requires not only courage but also prudence. In other words, we need to correct all the wrongly buttoned buttons, but we also need to avoid the consequences of catching a cold. This is truly something that can't be rushed or done in a fit of anger.

    “纽扣效应”评说
    雨晴
    系错了纽扣，那会引起什么效应呢？
    毫无办法，要校正长短襟的窘状。只有把上下错位的扣子从扣眼中旋将出来，然后再一一顺位。不然，将错就错，无论下面的纽扣系得如何漂亮，还是刹风景。
    这是生活小常识，无须评论。可是，如果在经济发展和改革中出现了“错扣子”，后果会很严重。特别是为校正一扣之差所需要的大返工，有可能引起巨大的损失。
    改革开放10年来，经济学家们对于我国经济体制的弊端作了透彻的分析。概言之，“大锅饭”、“铁饭碗”、“否定价值规律”等等正是经济生活中的“错扣子”。这些弊端不除，任何修修补补都将是在第一粒错扣子以后的瞎忙乎。这种猛切的革新言辞，即便有些激烈，却是点到了实质。
    党的十三届三中全会提出整治方针以来，人们注意到压缩基建规模，遏制经济过热成为各级党委和人民政府的工作重点。可是，也有些同志提出看法：“过去几年我们也一直着手控制固定资产投资规模，但由于旧体制投资吃大锅饭的弊端未革，规模总也压不下来。”这就涉及到整治和改革的关系。形象地说，不解开旧体制的“错扣子”，整顿治理也很难深入下去。
    再如，我国农业已连续四年徘徊不前。如何突破徘徊？各界人士都在思考。比较集中的观点是，长期以来粮价太低，种粮的比较效益甚差。既然种粮没有厚利，何以刺激农民的积极性？只有按照价值规律办事，改革不合理的价格体系，才可能使农业再上新台阶。靠行政动员，靠说服农民向农业多投入，都不可能根本奏效。这实际上反映的也是旧体制的“纽扣效应”。
    “纽扣效应”给我们造成的创痛太大了。而且，越是迟迟不从根本上把“错扣子”校正过来，越会遇到一系列“负效应”，并且以后再返工时的损失越大。这也许从反面说明了，为什么在中国推行改革能够得到绝大多数人的支持，以及为什么许多人对于改革抱有急切的心情。
    可是，发现症结只是解决问题的开始，现实的问题是，怎样校正错处。
    如果图痛快，尽可以放开手脚治本。譬如，既然是要遵从价值规律，何不一步放开物价，无论是柴米油盐，还是钢材、煤炭、原油，全由市场定价。可是，要吃要穿的群众承受得了否，吞吃原材料的厂家承受得了否，又怎能全然不顾。硬要“一次性”校正纽扣，痛快则痛快，怕是国民经济乃至社会安定都要出大问题。
    好比一个体弱的病人，身上的那件小褂系得上下不整，为正衣襟，猛然间把全部纽扣解开，袒怀于寒风之下，可能导致两种前途：一是顿时衣冠皆正，一是瘁然扑地，再也难起。
    任何比喻都是蹩脚的。这里只想说明，在中国这样一个积弊甚久的发展中国家实施改革，除了需要勇气，还需要稳妥。换句话说，我们既要把业已系错的纽扣如数理顺，又需要避免风寒侵袭的后果。这真是急不得、恼不得的事情。
