Before the Spring Festival, the *Beijing Daily* published a letter from a returned educated youth. This youth, who had worked in the countryside in Shanxi for many years, wrote with tears about how Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau official Li Guangchen repeatedly refused gifts. The most moving part was Li Guangchen's letter to this youth, in which he sincerely said, "I understand your family's feelings, and I also hope you understand me. There are already too many ugly phenomena in society, and we should not add to them."

Li Guangchen's rejection of gifts touched this youth, who then formed a belief: the vast majority of Party members and cadres are honest and upright, and the campaign for clean government will definitely succeed. After the news of Li Guangchen's rejection of gifts was published, it shocked various sectors of society, and some people proposed that Li Guangchen be listed as one of the top ten news figures of 1988 in the capital.

What kind of person is Li Guangchen? The reporter found him and his colleagues, intending to write about this ordinary cadre, but this sparked a "discussion on clean government."

Yan Zhijing (Party Committee cadre of the Municipal Labor Bureau): What Li Guangchen did is actually quite ordinary. Most of our cadres are clean and honest, and only a very few are lawless and disorderly. Nowadays, the media reports more on the dark side, and some people have developed misconceptions. It seems that corruption within the Party is so severe that it is difficult to control.

Reporter: Mr. Li Guangchen, how much is your income? Why did you reject the gifts? Is it because you don't care about that little bit of money, or is it for some other reason?

Li Guangchen: I have elderly parents and young children, and I earn only a hundred or so yuan a month, but I am not content. However, I am a state cadre, working for the government, and my actions reflect the government's image. Everyone understands the big principles, and the Party Constitution states them clearly. Moreover, we should have a conscience. A person should have the most basic thing—a conscience, a sense of responsibility, and professional ethics. Also, controlling one's desires is a way. Of course, if one is really poor, one can find a place where one can earn more money honestly. In short, we don't engage in crooked ways.

Reporter: This means that in dealing with the conflict between morality and desire, you rely on: one, moral conscience; two, suppressing desire; three, choosing the environment. For people like you, morality has a self-disciplining effect, but some people think that "moral education" is ineffective. What do you think about this issue?

Li Guangchen: Relying solely on moral education is certainly not enough. Some people can rely on consciousness, some need material incentives, and for some, the law is needed. We should use all these methods.

Wang Chengjing (Party Committee cadre of the Municipal Labor Bureau): We should also strongly advocate the revolutionary tradition of hard work and self-reliance. We need a spiritual pillar. Party members and cadres should have a sense of mission, responsibility, and goals.

Some comrades propose "high salaries to maintain integrity," but those who seek personal gain often are not the most impoverished. Moreover, the country cannot and the national conditions do not allow for immediately providing large sums of money to improve the living conditions of government employees. We are a party established under the principle of serving the people, advocating the spirit of dedication. I do not want my living standards to be higher than those of the masses.

Li Guangchen: I often think that now desires have been stimulated. Those with money can satisfy them, and those with power can too; but what about those without money or power?

Yan Zhijing: Older people often reminisce about the 1950s and the first half of the 1960s. Although life was hard then, people had ideals and big goals, spirits were high, and there was a sense of direction. During the Great Leap Forward, everyone smashed pots to smelt iron, worked hard, and the social atmosphere was healthy and upward.

Yan Zhijing: Now it seems that there is a lack of a strong authoritative center. In the era of Mao Zedong, whether what he said was right or wrong, people did not think but executed. Now it's different; people do as they please, and everyone can make a grab.

Reporter: Do you advocate rebuilding an authoritative center?

Yan Zhijing: Yes. Without the cohesive power of authority, the masses become a loose sand, and everyone does what they want.

Wang Chengjing: We should talk about personal responsibility, and everyone should "start with me," not adding to the ugly phenomena; every unit should grasp its own clean government construction, and then it is possible to form some good small atmospheres. If there are many small atmospheres, it will influence and even improve the big atmosphere.

Li Guangchen: Now we are using all the methods we can think of. The disease is still worsening.

Reporter: Will there be another remedy?

Li Guangchen: That is something for the decision-makers to consider. But as a Party member and cadre, I will definitely not add to the ugly phenomena.

　　李广臣拒礼引起的议论
    本报记者  王标
    春节前，《北京日报》刊登了一位回京知青的信。这个在山西插队多年的知青，饱蘸热泪叙述了北京市劳动局干部李广臣多次拒礼的事，最感人的是李广臣在给这位知青的一封信中恳切地说：“我理解你们全家的心情，也请你们理解我。现在社会上丑恶的现象已经不少了，我们不该再添上一笔。”
    李广臣拒礼，感动了这位知青，使他产生了一个信念：党员和干部绝大多数是廉洁奉公的，廉政建设一定会成功。李广臣拒礼的事见报之后，震动了社会各界，有人提出将李广臣列为１９８８年首都十大新闻人物。
    李广臣是个什么样的人呢？记者找到了他和他的同事们，想写一写这个普通干部，却引起了一场“议廉政”。
    阎志境（市劳动局机关党委干部）：李广臣所做的事其实十分平常。我们的干部绝大多数是清廉的，违法乱纪的只是极少数。如今报上对阴暗面的报道多了，有些人便产生了错觉。似乎党内的腐败现象已严重得难以收拾。
    记者：请问李广臣同志，你收入多少，拒礼，是因为不在乎那点礼，还是因为别的什么？
    李广臣：我上有老下有小，每月百十块钱，并不知足。但我是国家干部，为政府做事，我的言行关系到政府的形象。大道理谁都懂，党章上写得明明白白。另外，咱还要讲个良心。人，要有最起码的东西——良心，要有责任感和职业道德。再有，自个儿压住欲望也是个办法。当然，实在穷得不行了，换个挣钱多的地方，正正当当地去挣。总之，歪门邪道咱不搞。
    记者：这就是说，对付道德和欲望冲突，您靠的是：一、道德良心；二、抑制欲望；三、选择环境。对您这类人来说，道德是有律己效果的，但有些人却认为“道德说教”失灵了。您对这个问题怎么看？
    李广臣：光靠道德教育当然是不行的。有的人可靠觉悟，有的人需要物质刺激，对有的人要靠法，得把这几招都用上。
    王成景（劳动局机关党委干部）：还要大力提倡艰苦奋斗的革命传统。我们得靠精神支柱。党员和干部要有使命感、责任感和目标感。
    有些同志提出“厚俸养廉”，然而，以权谋私的人，往往并不是生活最窘困的人。再说，国家也不可能、国情也不允许马上拿出大钱改善机关工作人员的生活。我们是在为人民服务宗旨下建立起来的党，是提倡献身精神的。我就不想让自己的生活水平高于群众。
    李广臣：我常想，现在欲望是刺激起来了。有钱的当然可以满足，有权的也行；那没钱没权的怎么办？
    阎志境：上点年纪的人常怀念５０年代和６０年代前半期。那时，生活尽管艰苦，人们都有理想，有大目标，精神振奋，感到有奔头。大跃进时，大家砸锅炼铁，大干苦干，社会风气也是健康向上的。
    阎志境：现在好象缺少一个强有力的权威中心。毛泽东时代，他说的不管对不对，人们不思考就执行。现在不行了，人们各行其是，谁都可以捞。
    记者：您主张重建权威中心吗？
    阎志境：是的。没有权威的凝聚作用，群众就成了一盘散沙，干什么的都有。
    王成景：要讲个人的责任感，每个人都“从我做起”，不为丑恶现象再添上丑恶的一笔；每个单位都抓好自己的廉政建设，那么，就有可能形成一些良好的小气候。小气候多了，就会影响甚至改良大气候。
    李广臣：现在是想使的招儿都使出来了。病，还在加重。
    记者：还会不会另有方剂呢？
    李广臣：那就是决策人考虑的事情罗。但作为一个党员干部，我决不为丑恶现象添一笔。
