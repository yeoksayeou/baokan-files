The Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Xing Chongzhi, recently emphasized the need to overcome five mental obstacles in order to build a clean government while deploying anti-corruption work in the provincial government offices.

First, he said, we must overcome the mentality of difficulty and maintain confidence. We should not exaggerate the corruption within the party and government organs.

Second, we must overcome the idea that "if the big environment is not good, the small environment cannot be improved." He stressed that we must resolutely create a clean atmosphere. The notion that "anti-corruption work must first improve the 'big environment' before it can manage the 'small environment'" is an excuse to shirk responsibility.

Third, we must overcome the fear that anti-corruption efforts will hinder economic development. He emphasized that if everyone is afraid of acting early for fear of losing out and watches each other, anti-corruption work cannot proceed. For the overall interest, even if there are some temporary losses or sacrifices in certain aspects due to anti-corruption efforts, we must not waver in our resolve.

Fourth, we must overcome the idea of "self-interest has its reasons." He criticized those who think that their problems are minor compared to other places, claiming that "social distribution is unfair, and officials' salaries are low, making it difficult to maintain integrity," and using this as a theoretical basis to seek personal gain, forgetting to hold themselves to the standards of a Communist Party member and a state official.

Fifth, we must overcome the mentality of doing things in spurts. He believes that the most important thing at present is for the entire Party to work together to genuinely and effectively tackle anti-corruption. We must persist in this effort and not tighten up for a while and then relax, or only emphasize it when higher authorities do, and then let it go. We must avoid the phenomenon of much talk but little action, or starting strongly but ending weakly.

　　河北省委书记邢崇智提出
    克服五种思想障碍建设廉政
    本报石家庄三月十七日电  记者杨振武、陈国琦报道：中共河北省委书记邢崇智日前在省直机关部署廉政工作时指出，搞好廉政建设，必须克服五种思想障碍：
    一，要克服畏难思想，坚定信心，不能过分夸大党政机关的腐败现象。
    二，克服“大环境治不好，小环境治不了”的思想，下决心形成廉洁的小气候。他指出，那种认为“搞廉政建设，必须首先抓好‘大环境’才可能治理‘小环境’”的看法，是一种推卸责任的观点。
    三，要克服抓廉政怕影响经济发展的思想。他强调，如果都怕行动早会吃亏而互相观望，廉政建设就无法进行下去。为了全局利益，即使由于抓廉政在某些方面暂时吃一点亏，作出一些牺牲，也不能动摇决心。
    四，克服“谋私有理”的思想。他批评有的人认为自己那里的问题同其它地方比是“小巫见大巫”，认为“社会分配不公，干部工资低，难以养廉”等等，为谋私寻找理论依据，忘记了用共产党员和国家工作人员的标准要求自己。
    五，克服抓一阵子的思想。他认为，搞好廉政建设，目前最重要的是要全党动手一齐抓，动真的，抓实的。要坚持不懈地抓，不能紧一阵子，松一阵子，不能上面强调时就抓，过后就放，切实避免那种雷声大雨点小、虎头蛇尾的现象。
