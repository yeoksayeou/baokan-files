Over ten million migrant workers flock to Urumqi

		Our reporter Zeng Kun reports from Urumqi: When inland train stations are congested with migrant workers and frequently in crisis, the Urumqi Railway Station in the northwestern corner of the country is facing the same predicament. Since February 15, over ten thousand migrant workers have arrived at this railway station.

		Recently, the Autonomous Region People's Government has made a decision to strictly control the entry of construction teams from other provinces and regions into Xinjiang, allowing only the 12,000 construction workers from Jiangsu Province, as planned, to enter Xinjiang for construction work.
