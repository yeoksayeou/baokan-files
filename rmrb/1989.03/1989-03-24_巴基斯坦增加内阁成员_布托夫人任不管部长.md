Pakistan Adds Cabinet Members
Benazir Bhutto Appointed as Minister Without Portfolio

Istanbul, March 23 (Reported by Ren Yujun) – On the eve of Pakistan's national day, the Pakistani government announced the addition of 23 new cabinet members, including 6 federal ministers and 17 state ministers. Four women have been appointed to the cabinet, with Benazir Bhutto serving as a minister without portfolio.

This news was announced last night through the Urdu-language television news program to the nation. The purpose is to strengthen the federal cabinet. Having a woman serve as the prime minister and four women in the cabinet is unprecedented in Pakistan and in the history of Muslim countries. Analysts believe that Benazir Bhutto, who serves as the chairperson of the People's Party, joining the cabinet and serving as a minister without portfolio is understandable. If Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is unable to govern due to travel or other reasons, Benazir Bhutto can act as the head of the cabinet.

Today, President Ishaq Khan presided over the swearing-in ceremony of the new cabinet members at the new presidential palace in Islamabad.

This morning, President Ishaq Khan and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto attended the 42nd anniversary celebration of Pakistan's national day and the military parade at the Rawalpindi Racecourse.

In the evening, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto delivered a national day speech and explained the expansion of the cabinet.

　　巴基斯坦增加内阁成员        
    布托夫人任不管部长
    本报伊斯兰堡３月２３日电  记者任毓骏报道：巴基斯坦政府在其国庆前夕宣布，新增加２３名内阁成员，其中６名联邦部长、１７名国务部长，有４名女性入阁，布托夫人担任高资不管部长。
    这一消息是昨日晚间通过乌尔都语电视新闻节目向全国宣布的。目的是为了加强联邦内阁的力量。由妇女担任内阁总理同时又有４名妇女入阁这在巴基斯坦乃至穆斯林国家历史上都是绝无仅有的。分析家认为，担任人民党主席的布托夫人参加内阁并担任高资部长是可以理解的，如贝·布托总理出访或因其他原因不能主政，布托夫人可代理主持内阁事务。
    巴基斯坦总统伊沙克·汗今天在伊斯兰堡新总统府主持了新内阁成员的宣誓就职仪式。
    今天上午，伊沙克·汗总统和贝·布托总理在拉瓦尔品第赛马场出席了巴基斯坦国庆４２周年庆祝仪式和陆海空三军阅兵式。
    晚间，贝·布托总理发表了国庆讲话并就扩大内阁作了说明。
