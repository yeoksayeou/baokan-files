A reporter learned from the first meeting of the organizing committee that this championship will be funded and organized by the Beijing Xicheng District Sports Bureau, marking the first time China has organized an Asian championship in this manner.

The Yuetan Sports Stadium is one of the venues for the 1990 Asian Games. The August Asian Handball Championship will serve as a test for the Asian Games venue.
