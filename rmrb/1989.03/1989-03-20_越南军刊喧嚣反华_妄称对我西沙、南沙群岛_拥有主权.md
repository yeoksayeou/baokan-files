Vietnamese Military Journal Clamors Against China
Arrogantly Claims Sovereignty Over China's Xisha and Nansha Islands

New China News Agency, Hanoi, March 17 - The military journal of the Central Military Commission and the Ministry of Defense of the Vietnamese Communist Party, "People's National Defense" magazine, recently published an article by Navy Commander Vo Van Kiet and two other articles, stirring up anti-China sentiments regarding the Nansha Islands, the land border between China and Vietnam, and the Cambodian issue.

In this issue of "People's National Defense," Vietnamese Navy Commander Vo Van Kiet claims that Vietnam's maritime territory is "three times larger" than its land area and that Vietnam "has sovereignty" over China's Xisha and Nansha Islands.

Vo Van Kiet's article attacks China's recovery of the Xisha Islands in January 1974 and its self-defense counterattack against Vietnam's military provocations in the Nansha Islands in March 1983, labeling them as "aggressive and expansionist actions."

This high-ranking Vietnamese military officer boasts about expanding Vietnam's naval forces, gradually establishing a "basic combat component" that includes surface vessels, submarines, air forces, marine corps, and island defense units.

Another article in "People's National Defense" uses the tenth anniversary of the armed conflict on the China-Vietnam border to attack China's legitimate self-defense counterattacks, labeling them as an "aggression against Vietnam" and maliciously slandering China as "southern expansionist." The article repeatedly attacks China for its alleged "expansionism" and "hegemony."

This military publication also features a lengthy article "studying" the "theory" of the invasion of Cambodia, defending the decision made by the Le Duan group ten years ago to invade Cambodia, claiming that this decision was "necessary and completely correct," supposedly to "support the Cambodian revolution." The article openly declares that the so-called "Cambodian revolution" is aimed at "Chinese expansionism" and shouts, "Regardless of whether a political solution to the Cambodian issue can be reached, the achievements of the Cambodian revolution must be defended."

Diplomatic observers here have noted that the Vietnamese National Assembly amended the preamble of the constitution at the end of last year, removing the phrases that falsely accuse China of "expansionism" and "hegemony." Some Vietnamese leaders have repeatedly expressed their desire to improve relations with China and normalize bilateral relations. However, the anti-China propaganda in Vietnamese military publications indicates that the Vietnamese authorities still insist on their stubborn stance of invading Cambodia and opposing China. Their actions go against the fundamental interests of the Vietnamese people and are contrary to the current trend of international détente and dialogue.

### 越南军刊喧嚣反华  妄称对我西沙、南沙群岛“拥有主权”

　　越南军刊喧嚣反华
    妄称对我西沙、南沙群岛“拥有主权”
    新华社河内３月１７日电  越共中央军委和国防部机关刊物《全民国防》杂志最近一期发表海军司令甲文纲的文章以及其它两篇文章，就中国领土南沙群岛、中越陆地边界和柬埔寨问题掀起一股反华喧嚣。
    越南海军司令甲文纲在这期《全民国防》上发表文章声称，越南的海上领土比陆地面积“大３倍”，越南对中国的西沙、南沙群岛“拥有主权”。
    甲文纲在文章中攻击中国１９７４年１月收复西沙群岛、１９８３年３月在南沙群岛海域对越南的军事挑衅进行自卫还击是所谓“侵略、扩张行动”。
    越南这名高级将领叫嚣要扩大其海军力量，逐步建立包括水面舰只、潜艇、空军、海军陆战队、守岛部队的“基本战斗成份”。
    《全民国防》发表的另一篇文章借中越边境武装冲突十周年之机，攻击中国进行正当的自卫还击是“对越南的侵略战争”，恣意诬蔑中国“南下扩张”。文章一再攻击中国推行所谓“扩张主义”和“霸权主义”。
    这家军方刊物还发表一篇“研究”侵柬战争“理论”的长文，为黎笋集团十年前出兵侵略柬埔寨的决定辩解，说什么这个决定“是十分必要和完全正确的”，是所谓“支援柬埔寨革命”云云，并公然宣称所谓“柬埔寨革命”的对象是“中国扩张主义”等等。文章还叫嚷：“不管柬埔寨问题能否达成政治解决办法，柬埔寨革命成果一定要保卫”。
    此间外交观察家们注意到，越南国会去年年底修改了宪法序言，删除了诬指中国为“扩张主义、霸权主义”的词句。越南一些领导人一再表示希望改善同中国的关系，实现两国关系正常化。但是，越南军方刊物的反华宣传表明，越南当局迄今仍然坚持侵柬反华的顽固立场。他们的所作所为，违背了越南人民的根本利益，也同当前国际缓和与对话的发展趋势背道而驰。
