Investigators from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, who are probing the February 24 incident in which a United Airlines Boeing 747's fuselage ruptured, are preparing to transport a component of the cargo door latch back to Washington to determine the cause of the accident.

The investigation into this accident, which occurred over the Pacific near Hawaii and resulted in the disappearance of nine people and injuries to many others, has now focused on the cargo door area.

The 3-meter square cargo door of the Boeing 747 is secured by two hooks on the left and right sides and eight latches at the bottom. The door-closing process is controlled by an electronic device. However, the cargo door, which contains all the moving parts of the door latch mechanism, has not yet been found.

Officials from the Transportation Safety Board said that the eight latch holes on the fuselage of the accident aircraft showed only scratches and no other damage or abnormalities. Investigators removed a support component of one of the latches and are preparing to transport it back to Washington for metal analysis. The analysis results will determine whether these latches broke or failed to engage.

　　客机缘何身撕裂  调查集中到舱门
    新华社华盛顿２月２７日电  调查２４日联合航空公司波音７４７客机机身爆裂事件的美国国家交通安全委员会的工作人员，准备把该机货舱门锁的一个部件运回华盛顿，以确定事故原因。
    围绕这起发生在夏威夷附近的太平洋上空、造成９人失踪和多人受伤的事故进行的调查，目前已经集中到货舱舱门区域。
    波音７４７飞机３米见方的货舱门是由左右两个钩子和底部８个插销固定的，舱门关闭过程由电子装置控制。但装有门锁机构所有移动部件的舱门至今还没有找到。
    交通安全委员会的官员说，事故飞机机身上的８个插销孔除了留有刻痕之外没有其他任何破损和异常。调查人员拆除了一个插销的支撑部件，准备运回华盛顿作金属分析。分析结果将确定，这些插销是否断裂或者未能插上。
