After Chun Doo-hwan's Resignation

Early last year, Chun Doo-hwan, who had ruled South Korea for over seven years, left the "Presidential Palace" and returned to his private residence in Yeongdeungpo. At that time, his state of mind, as he later described, was one of relief, pride, and joy for not repeating the fate of his predecessor, who fled overseas and was killed by his subordinates.

He had planned to live an "ordinary citizen's life," traveling around the country, visiting relatives and friends; reading books, writing memoirs; and taking care of his children's education with his wife. However, within less than a year, he had to read an apology to the people and was expelled, exiled to Baekdam Temple to become a "monk." He said that this situation was "more difficult to endure than prison life."

"Self-inflicted" Chun Doo-hwan himself admitted: "The president who voluntarily stepped down at the end of his term immediately became the target of national criticism as the main culprit of illegal activities, which can be said to be self-inflicted."

The "National Assembly" through activities such as "National Administration Inspection" exposed Chun Doo-hwan's misdeeds of abusing power, suppressing democracy, stifling public opinion, and harming the innocent. For example:

He mobilized the military to suppress the democratic demands of the citizens and students of Gwangju, resulting in the massacre of countless people; under the pretext of "purifying society," he sent nearly 40,000 people to military camps, subjecting a large number of innocent people to severe torture, forced labor, and even death; under the pretext of "purifying civil servants," he dismissed 5,699 public officials, and to this day, 29% of them have not been reinstated; he suppressed the media, shutting down more than 2/3 of newspapers, radio stations, and news agencies, arresting more than 20 people, and dismissing more than 700 people; under his protection, many of his relatives either rose to high positions or became wealthy. Last year, his elder brother Chun Ki-hwan, younger brother Chun Kyung-hwan, and father-in-law Lee Gwi-dong, among nearly 10 people, were successively imprisoned for various illegal activities.

Official Struggle The South Korean magazine "New East Asia" said that another reason for Chun Doo-hwan's resignation was his failure in the official struggle. For example, although he and Roh Tae-woo were close friends for many years, there were times when they bit each other's tongues. After Roh Tae-woo took office as "President," facing the severe situation of "small ruling party and large opposition party" in the "National Assembly" elections and the strong pressure from the opposition parties to settle accounts with the Chun Doo-hwan regime, he had to make Chun Doo-hwan gradually withdraw from the political stage.

Within half a month of Roh Tae-woo taking office, he ordered the reduction of the "National Elders Consultative Council" expanded by Chun Doo-hwan, making Chun Doo-hwan's dream of "reigning behind the scenes" bubble. He also had to resign from the positions of "Speaker" and honorary chairman of the Minjung Party. Subsequently, Roh Tae-woo also reorganized the military, replacing the positions of more than 80 high-ranking generals, including the Chief of the Army General Staff, allowing many generals of his own faction to be promoted.

As the "National Assembly" hearings deepened and more of Chun Doo-hwan's family members were arrested, Chun Doo-hwan prepared to make a "separate explanation" on the so-called "political funds issue." According to the disclosure, once the truth is revealed, it will be disastrous for both the top and the bottom, and it was also called the "bomb declaration." At this time, Roh Tae-woo had a half-hour phone conversation with Chun Doo-hwan in mid-November last year. Chun Doo-hwan finally agreed to read an apology, hand over his property, and go to the countryside to live in seclusion.

Future Whereabouts In Baekdam Temple, Chun Doo-hwan and his wife have been living in a small room of about 7 square meters, eating simple vegetarian meals, chanting sutras, and praying to the Buddha, guarded by security personnel, and rarely interacting with the outside world. Will Chun Doo-hwan stay like this?

Roh Tae-woo had asked people to forgive Chun Doo-hwan. However, a recent public opinion poll showed that 49.4% of people advocated dealing with the matter after the truth is revealed. The opposition parties are also relentlessly pursuing Chun Doo-hwan's issue. As for whether Chun Doo-hwan will flee overseas, he himself said in his "confession": "As long as it is not leaving the country, wherever everyone asks me to go, I will go there with a repentant heart."

### 全斗焕下台以后

　　全斗焕下台以后
    去年初，统治南朝鲜７年多的全斗焕，离开“总统府”，回到了私邸延禧洞。当时他的心态，正如他后来描述的那样，为“没有重蹈前任总统流亡海外和被部下杀害的覆辙而感到放心、自豪和喜悦”。
    他本来打算过“普通的市民生活”，到各地旅行，访亲问友；看看书，撰写回忆录；同妻子一起抓抓儿童教育。谁知不到一年时间，他就不得不向人民宣读谢罪书，并被扫地出门，放逐到百潭寺当了“苦行僧”。他说，这种处境“比监狱生活还难熬”。
    “自作自受”　全斗焕自己承认：“任期届满自动离位的总统刚去职，就作为不法的主人公变成国民批判的靶子，可说是我自作自受。”
    “国会”通过“国政监察”等活动揭露了全斗焕滥用权力、镇压民主、扼杀舆论、枉害无辜等劣迹。如：
    调动军队镇压要求民主的光州市民和学生，使无数百姓惨遭杀害；以“净化社会”为名，把近４万人押送军营，让大批无辜者遭受严刑拷打，参加苦役劳动，甚至被迫害致死；以“净化公务员”为名，开除了５６９９名公职人员，迄今尚有２９％的人没有复职；扼杀舆论力量，关闭了２／３以上的报社、电台和通讯社等新闻机构，逮捕２０余人，开除７００多人；在他庇护下，他的不少亲戚或平步青云，或腰缠万贯。去年，他的胞兄全基焕、胞弟全敬焕、岳丈李圭东等近１０人先后因各种不法行为而锒铛入狱。
    官场较量　南朝鲜《新东亚》杂志称，全斗焕下台的另一原因是他在官场争斗中失败。比如，他和卢泰愚虽系多年至交，可牙齿也有咬着舌头的时候。卢泰愚出任“总统”后，面对“国会议员”选举中出现“朝小野大”的严峻形势和在野党要求清算全斗焕政权的强大压力，不得不让全斗焕一步步退出政治舞台。
    卢泰愚上台不出半个月，就下令压缩经全斗焕扩充过的“国家元老咨询会议”的机构，使全斗焕“垂帘听政”的美梦化为泡影，并不得不辞去“议长”和民正党名誉总裁等职。随后，卢泰愚又对军队进行了改组，调换包括陆军总参谋长在内的８０多名高级将领的职务，使自己派系的许多将领得到升迁。
    随着“国会”听证会的深入揭发和全斗焕家族成员的相继落网，全斗焕准备对所谓“政治资金问题”作“单独说明”。据披露，一旦公开内幕，将是台上台下谁也没有好结果，因而又被称作“炸弹宣言”。这时，卢泰愚在去年１１月中旬同全斗焕电话交谈了半小时，全斗焕最后同意宣读谢罪书，交出产财，下乡隐居。
    今后去向　在百潭寺，全斗焕夫妇至今深居在一间约７平方米的僧房里，每日简装素餐，诵经拜佛，由警卫人员警戒守护，几乎不与外界接触。全斗焕会这样呆下去吗？
    卢泰愚曾要求人们赦免全斗焕。但是，最近的一项舆论调查表明，４９．４％的人主张在查清问题后再行处理。在野党也对全斗焕的问题紧追不舍。至于全斗焕会不会流亡海外，他自己在“罪己诏”中说：“只要不是离开祖国，大家叫我到哪里去，我将怀着赎罪的心情到那里去。”
