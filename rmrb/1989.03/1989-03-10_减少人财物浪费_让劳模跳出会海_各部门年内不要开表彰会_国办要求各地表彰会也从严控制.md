The State Council Office yesterday issued a notice requiring various ministries and directly affiliated institutions to strictly control the convening of various commendation meetings.

The notice states that this year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have decided to hold a national commendation meeting before National Day to commend labor models and advanced workers who have made outstanding contributions in various fields and sectors in reform and construction. It is understood that some departments are also preparing to hold commendation meetings for their respective systems. If each system holds commendation meetings layer by layer, it will not only exacerbate the tension in transportation, urban supply, and accommodation, causing a great waste of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, but also the frequent evaluation work will increase the burden on the grassroots level, causing labor models to be trapped in numerous meetings, interfering with their normal work.

The State Council Office, in accordance with the instructions of the State Council leaders, requires that from now on, various departments should not hold various commendation meetings this year. For those few departments that must hold meetings, they should report to the State Council for approval in accordance with relevant regulations. Departments should commend advanced individuals as much as possible by utilizing modern propaganda means such as telephone, television, radio, and newspapers. The postal, radio, film and television, and other propaganda departments should actively support and provide convenience.

The notice also requires that the people's governments of various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should also strictly control the convening of labor model commendation meetings in accordance with the above spirit.

　　减少人财物浪费　让劳模跳出会海
    各部门年内不要开表彰会
    国办要求各地表彰会也从严控制
    新华社北京３月９日电  国务院办公厅昨天发出通知，要求各部委、各直属机构严格控制召开各类表彰大会。
    通知说，今年是中华人民共和国建国四十周年。中共中央、国务院已经决定，在国庆节前夕召开全国表彰大会，表彰各行各业、各条战线在改革和建设中作出突出贡献的劳动模范和先进工作者。据了解，有些部门也正在筹备本系统的表彰大会。各系统层层开表彰会，不仅会加剧交通运输、城市供应和住宿的紧张状况，造成人力、物力、财力的很大浪费，而且频繁的评比工作，也会加重基层的负担，使劳动模范本人陷入众多的会议之中，干扰他们的正常工作。
    国务院办公厅遵照国务院领导同志指示，要求各部门从现在起，今年内不要召开各种表彰大会。个别部门确需召开的，应按有关规定，报国务院批准。各部门表彰先进人物，应尽可能利用电话、电视、广播、报纸等现代化宣传手段。邮电、广播影视和其他宣传部门要积极予以支持，提供方便。
    通知还要求各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府也按照上述精神，从严控制召开劳模表彰大会。
