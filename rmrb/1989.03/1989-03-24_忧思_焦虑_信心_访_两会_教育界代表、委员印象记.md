During the visits and listening sessions, the reporter had a strong feeling that the representatives and committee members from the education sector were deeply worried about the current backward state of education. Their speeches, petitions, and appeals to the media all revolved around four major issues: school funding, teacher compensation, teacher status, and teacher resources.

The temporary chaos and disorder brought by the impact of a commodity economy, the spread of the new "uselessness of studying" theory, teachers' disillusionment with teaching, students' dropping out of school, the increase in illiteracy, the weakening of moral education, and the decline in the cultural and educational level of the entire nation have made them feel uneasy and confused.

More than 100 members of the CPPCC Education Group had a dialogue with Li Tieming, the Minister of the State Education Commission. Several dozen committee members eagerly took the floor, even to the point of "grabbing the microphone." They were excited, anxious, and worried, all out of the same concern—to help education escape from its dire straits. This anxiety revealed a heart that cares deeply for the nation and its people.

On the opening night of the CPPCC, I went to the Guoyi Hotel for an interview. The corridors were quiet, as everyone had gone to watch a movie, except for the brightly lit conference room on the third floor. More than 60 members of the China Democratic League group were sitting there, working late into the night to revise their speech for the plenary session, titled "Revitalizing Education Cannot Be Delayed." It was said that they had already revised the draft ten times. The serious, focused, and solemn expressions of the elderly members were touching. The discussion continued until late at night, 11 o'clock.

Revitalizing education cannot be delayed. CPPCC member and professor from Shandong University, Wu Fuheng, loudly called out: "Currently, various levels of leadership generally pay more attention to economic development, following the old model of prioritizing economics over education. They focus on short-term material production that can be realized quickly, while neglecting the investment in education that takes ten years or even longer to see results. This is a short-sighted tendency that is far from the strategic position of education proposed by the central government. However, without education, science, and culture as a foundation, economic development will inevitably become a river without a source. The decline of education will inevitably lead to the shrinkage of the economy and a national crisis."

A representative from Henan, the president of Zhengzhou Institute of Technology, Li Liangfu, told the reporter that currently, universities are facing three challenges: the impact of rising prices, the impact of a commodity economy, and the impact of ideological and theoretical confusion. As a university president, the pressure is immense. He hopes that the state will provide protective policies for education during the transitional period between the old and new systems.

The new "uselessness of studying" theory is a hot topic of discussion. Beijing University professor Xu Guangxian has 9 doctoral students, 3 of whom have dropped out, and 3 are wavering. The old "uselessness of studying" theory was an external injury, while the new one is an internal injury. Xu Guangxian is seeking a cure for this internal injury. He said, "I suggest launching a nationwide discussion to reflect on and summarize the past 40 years of education; seriously implement the Compulsory Education Law, and those who violate the law should be subject to legal sanctions; individual business operators should have a junior high school education to obtain a business license; demobilized soldiers should receive training before employment, and they can be given priority to transfer schools; deepen the reform of the personnel system to form a mechanism of equal competition, etc."

Amidst worries and anxieties, there is hope and confidence.

During the discussion between Li Tieming, the Minister of the State Education Commission, and the education committee members, he explained the severe situation facing education on one hand, and on the other hand, he proposed ideas for the future development and reform of education. He said that currently, it is necessary to increase investment, both by increasing state financial allocations and by guiding social forces to participate in education. He also proposed to establish a system of teacher salaries, medical care, housing, retirement, and rewards, to strengthen education legislation, gradually establish an education legal system that adapts to the needs of commodity economy development, and implement a national education supervision system. He also proposed to strengthen the local government's overall planning and decision-making power over education, expand the autonomy of schools, and change the structure of education administrative departments as subordinate units.

People saw confidence in the sincere belief of education professionals in their common cause; they saw confidence in the national leaders' recognition of the severe situation and their active efforts to address and solve the problems.

### 忧思·焦虑·信心——访“两会”教育界代表、委员印象记

　　忧思·焦虑·信心        
    ——访“两会”教育界代表、委员印象记
    本报记者  孟晓云
    在访问和旁听中，记者有一种强烈的感受，教育界的代表和委员对目前教育落后的现状充满了深深的忧虑。他们陈词、上书、向舆论界呼吁，都离不开四大问题：办学经费、教师待遇、教师地位、师资问题。
    商品经济冲击带来的暂时的混乱无序状态，新的“读书无用论”的蔓延，教师厌教、学生弃学、文盲增加、德育弱化、全民族的文化教育素质的下降使他们深感不安和困惑。
    政协教育组百余人与国家教委主任李铁映对话，几十个委员争先恐后地发言，甚至到了“抢话筒”的地步。他们激动、焦急、忧虑，都是出于一种心情——为了使教育从窘迫的困境中解脱。从这种焦虑的情绪中让人感受到了忧国忧民之心的跃动。
    政协开幕那天晚上，我到国谊宾馆采访，楼道内静悄悄的，人们都去看电影了，唯有三楼会议室灯光通明，６０多位民盟小组的委员端坐在那里“加班加点”，逐字逐句地修改着他们的以《振兴教育刻不容缓》为题的大会发言，据说已十易其稿。老人们的神情那么认真、专注、严肃，让人感动。讨论进行到深夜１１时。
    振兴教育刻不容缓。政协委员、山东大学教授吴富恒大声疾呼：“当前各级领导比较起来普遍注重抓经济，习惯于按旧的模式先经济、后教育，只注重短期内实现的物质生产，而忽略需十年乃至更长时间才能见到效益的教育事业投资，这是一种急功近利倾向，与中央提出的教育的战略地位相距甚远。殊不知，没有教育、科技和文化为后盾，经济发展必然成为无源之水，教育的衰落必然会导致经济的萎缩、民族的危机。”
    来自河南的人大代表、郑州工学院院长厉良辅告诉记者，目前高校面临着三个冲击：物价上涨的冲击；商品经济的冲击；思想和理论混乱的冲击。作为校长，压力很大。他希望国家在新旧体制交替的过渡时期给教育以保护政策。
    新的“读书无用论”是大家议论的热点。北京大学教授徐光宪带的９个博士研究生，有３个退学了，３个正在动摇。过去的“读书无用论”是外伤，现在新的“读书无用论”是内伤。徐光宪寻求着医治内伤的药方，他说，我建议开展全民讨论，对４０年的教育进行反思和总结；认真贯彻九年义务教育法，违法者应受法律制裁；个体商贩领取营业执照时须有初中毕业文化水平；复员军人先培训后就业，他们可以优先转学；深化改革人事制度，要形成平等竞争的机制等等。
    忧思和焦虑中孕育着希望和信心。
    国家教委主任李铁映与教育界委员座谈时，一方面说明了教育面临的严峻形势，一方面提出了今后教育的发展和改革的设想。他说，当前要增加投入，既要增加国家的财政拨款，又要引导社会力量参与办教育。他还提出要建立一套教师工资、医疗、住房、退休制度和奖励制度，加强教育立法，逐步建立适应商品经济发展需要的教育法规体系，并在全国实行教育督导员制度，加强地方对教育的统筹权和决策权，扩大学校自主权，改变教育行政部门附属单位的格局。
    人们从教育界人士对共同事业的虔诚信念中看到了信心；从国家领导人认识到形势的严峻并积极给以关注和尽力解决的努力中看到了信心。
