Zhao Ziyang Says Hong Kong's Future Looks Bright

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 18 (Reporter Chai Shikuang): General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Zhao Ziyang said today that he believes the situation in Hong Kong will definitely be good after the Chinese government resumes sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.

	Zhao Ziyang said that this can be seen from the successful resolution of several major events related to Hong Kong in the 1980s: the governments of China and Britain signed the Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue, the two sides have effectively cooperated in the Joint Liaison Group and the Land Commission, and the drafting of the Basic Law has progressed smoothly. Over the past few years, Hong Kong's political situation has been stable, and the economy has developed, with the situation being better than expected.

	Zhao Ziyang pointed out that the political situation in mainland China is stable, the economy is developing, and the current policies will not be reversed. All of these should give Hong Kong compatriots more confidence in the future.

	Regarding the Taiwan issue, Zhao Ziyang said: "We propose to use the concept of 'one country, two systems' to solve the unification problem between the mainland and Taiwan, which is better than federalism, so Taiwan can enjoy greater autonomy."

	Zhao Ziyang made these remarks this afternoon when he met with a delegation from the Hong Kong Future Studies Association led by Professor Zhuo Zhizhuang from Princeton University in the United States in Zhongnanhai.

	The Hong Kong Future Studies Association, initiated by Zhuo Zhizhuang, was established on January 24 this year and consists of more than 10 well-known figures in society. According to Zhuo Zhizhuang, the main focus of this association is to pay attention to whether the future political system and development trends of Hong Kong are in the interests of the people of Hong Kong, so as to reflect on the Hong Kong government and the Chinese government.

	Zhao Ziyang told the guests that he welcomes the establishment of the association and has high hopes for it. Zhao Ziyang said: "We welcome your suggestions, which can be used as a reference and inspiration for us when formulating policies for Hong Kong."

　　赵紫阳会见海外客人时说
    香港前途看好
    据新华社北京３月１８日电  （记者柴世宽）中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天在此间表示相信，１９９７年中国政府收回香港的主权后，香港的情况肯定看好。
    赵紫阳说，这从８０年代有关香港的几件大事的顺利解决可以看得明白：中英两国政府签署了关于香港问题的联合声明，中英双方在联合联络小组及土地委员会进行了有效合作，香港基本法起草工作进展顺利。几年来香港政局稳定，经济发展，情况比预料的要好。
    赵紫阳指出，中国内地的政治局势是稳定的，经济在发展，现行的政策不会逆转。所有这些应该使香港同胞对前途增强信心。
    关于台湾问题，赵紫阳说：“我们提出用‘一国两制’的构想来解决大陆同台湾的统一问题比联邦制更好，这样台湾可以享有更大的自治权。”
    赵紫阳是今天下午在中南海会见由美国普林斯顿大学教授邹至庄率领的香港前途研究会赴京团时说这些话的。
    由１０多位社会知名人士组成的香港前途研究会由邹至庄发起，于今年１月２４日成立。据邹至庄介绍，这个研究会主要是关注香港未来的政治制度及发展趋势是否符合香港人的利益，以便向港英当局和中国政府反映。
    赵紫阳对客人说，他对研究会的成立表示欢迎，并寄予希望。赵紫阳说：“欢迎你们多提建议，这可以供我们在制定对香港的政策时参考、借鉴。”
