The liquor industry must focus on saving grain.

In 1988, China's annual production of yellow rice wine was 910,000 tons, requiring 400,000 tons of rice, but there was a shortage of 288,000 tons, causing some liquor factories to halt or reduce production. Zhejiang Province is a major producer of yellow rice wine in China, with an annual production of 610,000 tons, but in 1988, there was a shortage of 250,000 tons of grain. In addition, the production of beer and white liquor consumes even more grain. I believe that in addition to rectifying the production of alcoholic beverages, we should also pay special attention to the issue of saving grain in the liquor industry.

Regarding the issue of saving grain in the liquor industry, as early as in China's first Five-Year Plan, it was stipulated: "Gradually use potatoes, fruits, and other substitutes instead of rice, wheat, and coarse grains for brewing, to save grain." Due to various reasons, this policy has not been well implemented. I suggest that relevant departments, based on China's national conditions, strengthen the promotion of saving grain in the liquor industry, and formulate plans and measures for saving grain.

Firstly, we should tap into the production potential within enterprises and strive to reduce the grain consumption per ton of liquor. Currently, the grain consumption per ton of liquor varies greatly among different manufacturers. For example, the grain consumption for producing 1 ton of beer ranges from 254 kg to 165 kg. This requires the use of new technologies and processes to minimize the grain consumption per ton of liquor.

Secondly, we should strengthen the research and development of substitutes for liquor raw materials. According to 1972 data, the country produced 360,000 tons of substitute white liquor, accounting for 37.5% of the total white liquor production, saving 650 million kg of grain, which is worth learning from. Wild plant starch, sugar, and agricultural processing waste can all be used in liquor production. Thirdly, we should limit the use of grain to produce ordinary white liquor and develop low-degree white liquor. White liquor consumes the most grain, and there is the greatest potential for saving grain.

　　酿酒工业必须重视节约粮食
    １９８８年我国黄酒年产量９１万吨，所需大米４０万吨，因短缺２８．８万吨，造成一些酒厂停工或半停工。浙江省是我国黄酒的主要产地，年产黄酒６１万吨，１９８８年缺粮２５万吨。此外，啤酒和白酒生产粮食耗用量更大。我认为除了整顿酒类生产外，还应特别重视酿酒工业中的节粮问题。
    关于酿酒节粮问题，早在我国第一个五年计划中就规定：“逐步利用薯类、果品代替稻、麦、杂粮等酿酒，以节约粮食”。由于种种原因，这个方针没有很好地坚持下来。建议有关部门根据我国的国情，加强对酿酒节粮的宣传，并制订节粮规划和措施。
    首先应挖掘企业内部生产潜力，努力降低吨酒耗粮率。目前一些厂家生产酒消耗粮食的差距甚大。例如，生产１吨啤酒，耗粮最多的厂家为２５４公斤，最少的为１６５公斤。这就需要采用新技术、新工艺，把吨酒耗粮率降到最低限度。
    其次应加强酿酒原料代用品的研究和开发。据１９７２年的资料，全国共生产代用品白酒３６万吨，占白酒总产量的３７．５％，节粮６．５亿公斤，这是值得借鉴的。野生植物淀粉、糖类和农产品加工渣料等，都可用于酒类生产。三是要限制用粮食生产普通白酒，发展低度白酒。白酒耗粮最多，节粮的潜力也最大。
