A few years ago, Drew Barrymore, then just 7 years old, became famous overnight for her role as the little girl Katie in the film "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," causing a sensation in the United States. Subsequently, she acted in four more films. The path to the artistic hall of fame seemed bright and colorful for this new star from a family of filmmakers. But she started using drugs. She is currently undergoing treatment in a detoxification center. Before last Christmas, she recounted to journalists the process of her straying from the right path. The French magazine "Paris Match" reported her story, which is excerpted below:

Ever since I acted in "E.T.," my life changed completely. I was often surrounded by movie audiences who asked for my autograph, posed for pictures, and many people just wanted to touch me, as if I had become a sacred object. At that time, I was only 7 years old, but I had to act like a 30-year-old woman. After a year, I was exhausted, feeling like I was going crazy. I started skipping school, wandering the streets, or hanging out in movie theaters and nightclubs. The gap between me and my peers grew wider.

I often felt bored and lonely. Staying at home was boring. My dad had separated from my mom. I was raised by my mom alone. To earn more money to support me, she worked as a waitress every night. I envied others who had fathers. I thought, my dad must be special; otherwise, why wouldn't he come home? One night, he suddenly returned, and I shouted "Dad!" excitedly, thinking he would come back to my life. But he left again and never came back. Once, I mustered the courage to call him and shouted, "Dad, I love you!" But I never received his love. I didn't have a complete family and often cried and screamed in pain. After I became famous, my mom quit her job to take care of me, but I didn't understand that she did this out of love. Instead, I resented her, often arguing with her. I even doubted whether she was my mom or my agent.

At 9, I became more reckless and started drinking. Then I thought, why not try marijuana? Someone tried to stop me: "Little girls who do drugs are disgusting." I thought, as long as I feel good, who cares if others dislike me! Soon, I started using cocaine.

On a night in June 1987, after a drinking contest with others, I returned home drunk and threw myself into my mom's arms, screaming and shouting. Mom couldn't let me behave like this, so she put me in the car and sent me to a detoxification center.

After entering the detoxification center, I was really depressed, crying all day, and it took more than 10 days to calm down. But at that time, a director asked me to go to Nevada to shoot a film, and I was free again. I dressed up like a sexy woman, charming and alluring. I went to the entertainment venue to gamble, and when people asked my age, I said, "I'm 22!" After finishing the film, I was no longer willing to receive detoxification treatment, although I felt something bad might happen.

Soon, I went to New York for an audition. One day, in the restroom of a nightclub, I met a girl who asked me, "Do you want to have some fun?" I was a bit nervous and said, "No!" The girl stared at me and asked, "Are you sure you don't want to try it?" Suddenly, my mind collapsed, and I burst into tears. Looking at my watch, it was exactly 12:37. I smashed the watch and told myself, "Just do it, it will make you sober." After taking a bit of cocaine, my whole body trembled. In a daze, I remembered that I hadn't used drugs for 88 days. Was all this effort going to be in vain?... Walking out of the restroom, a peddler asked me if I wanted cocaine. I gritted my teeth and thought, "In for a penny, in for a pound," and bought several packs.

A few days later, I stole my mom's credit card, took the drugs, and went to Hollywood with a friend. I bought several hundred dollars' worth of clothes and got more than a dozen "happy pills" (drugs). Back in New York, as soon as I entered the door, my mom's private investigator tied me up and took me back to the detoxification center...

I have been in the detoxification center for 3 months. In these 3 months, I haven't drunk alcohol or used drugs. I know this is a matter of my future, and I am quitting my bad habits, which makes me happy. I share my experience, hoping to help those who face the same difficulties as me.

　　天真女娃演“外星人”红极了　吸毒成瘾灰透了       
    好莱坞童星的自述
    几年前，年方７岁的德鲁·巴里莫尔因在影片《外星人》中扮演小女孩凯蒂而一举成名，轰动美国。随后，她又演了４部片子。展现在这位电影世家出身的新影星眼前的，是一条通往艺术殿堂的五彩之路。可是，她吸毒了。目前正在一家戒毒所接受治疗。去年圣诞节前夕，她向新闻记者讲述了自己误入歧途的经过。法国《巴黎竞赛画报》报道了她的谈话，现摘编如下：
    自从拍了《外星人》，我的生活完全变样了。我常常被电影观众包围，他们要我签名、摆姿势照像，许多人挨近我，仅仅是想接触我一下，好像我成了圣物。当时我才７岁，举止却得像个３０岁的女性。１年下来，我被折腾得精疲力尽，觉得快要疯了。我开始旷课，到街上闲逛，或泡泡电影院、夜总会。我和同龄小朋友之间的隔阂变得越来越大。
    我常常感到无聊、孤独。在家里呆着怪没意思的。我爸爸早和妈妈分居了。我是妈妈一手带大的，为了多挣钱抚养我，她每天晚上要去饭馆当服务员。我羡慕别人有爸爸。我想，我的爸爸一定很特别，要不他怎么老不回家呢？一天晚上，他突然回来，我盯着他大叫一声“爸爸！”想到他将回到我的生活中来，我感到幸福极了。可是，他走了，再也没有回来。有一次，我鼓足勇气给他打电话，大声说：“爸爸，我爱你！”可我始终没有得到过他的爱。我没有一个完整的家，常常难过得又哭又叫。我出名后，妈妈辞了工作，一心照顾我，但我不理解她这样做是爱我，反而对她有怨气，常常顶撞她。我甚至怀疑，她究竟是我妈妈还是我的经纪人。
    ９岁，我更加放纵自己，开始喝酒。后又想，为什么不试试大麻呢？有人劝阻我：“小姑娘吸毒惹人讨厌。”我想，只要自己觉得好，管别人讨厌不讨厌！不久，我又吸上了可卡因。
    １９８７年６月的一个夜晚，我跟别人比赛完喝啤酒，醉醺醺地回到家，一头扑到妈妈怀里，对她大叫大闹。妈妈不能听任我这么胡闹，把我抱上汽车，送进了戒毒所。
    进了戒毒所，我真是灰透了，整天地哭，１０多天才平静下来。可这时，导演让我去内华达拍片，我又自由了。我打扮成性感女郎，妖冶迷人。我到娱乐场去赌博，人们问我的年龄，我说：“２２了！”拍完片子，我就不大愿意接受戒毒治疗了，虽然我感到还会出事。
    不久，我又去纽约试镜头。一天，我在夜总会的洗手间遇到一位姑娘，她问我：“想不想过过瘾？”我有点紧张，说：“不！”那姑娘盯着我问：“你真的不想吸？”霎时间，我的精神崩溃了，嚎啕大哭起来。看了看表，正是零点３７分，我把手表砸了，对自己说：“吸吧，吸点会清醒的。”吸了一点可卡因，我的全身战栗起来。恍惚中，我记起已８８天没吸毒了，难道这些天的努力要前功尽弃了？……走出洗手间，一个小贩问我要不要可卡因，我咬咬牙，一不做，二不休，吸！一下就买了几包。
    几天以后，我偷了妈妈的信用卡，带上毒品，和女友一起到了好莱坞。我买了好几百块钱的衣服，搞了十几支“快乐客”（毒品名）。回到纽约，一进家门，妈妈雇的私人侦探就把我绑起来，押回了戒毒所……
    我在戒毒所已经住了３个月了。这３个月，我没酗酒，没有吸毒。我知道，这是事关前途的大事，我正在戒掉恶习，真高兴。我把自己的经历讲出来，希望能帮助和我面临同样困难的人。
