	China's economy in 1988 was a year of mixed fortunes, marked by both significant achievements and notable challenges. The national economy was exceptionally active but unstable, reflecting a year of both joy and concern.

	According to the statistical bulletin released by the National Bureau of Statistics today, the past year saw China's national economy develop amidst deepening reforms and accelerated opening up, with economic strength further enhanced. Preliminary calculations indicate that the gross national product for the year was 1385.3 billion yuan, an 11.2% increase over the previous year. National income stood at 1153.3 billion yuan, up 11.4% from the previous year. The rural economy continued to grow, with the total social product of rural areas increasing by 12.9% compared to the previous year. The total industrial output value nationwide rose by 20.7%, excluding township and village enterprises, the growth was 17.7%. Several key power stations, coal mines, railways, and ports were completed and put into operation, adding to the economy's sustained development capabilities. The total value of imports and exports through customs exceeded $100 billion for the first time, a 24.4% increase from the previous year. Foreign trade methods became more diversified, and trade partners more varied. Urban and rural residents saw an increase in income, with the average disposable income of urban residents per capita being 1119 yuan, which, after adjusting for price increases, saw a real growth of 1.2%. The average net income of farmers per capita was 545 yuan, which, after adjusting for the price increases of commodity consumption, saw a real growth of 6.3%.

	The nearly 10,000-word statistical bulletin also revealed the other side of the story. The past year presented us with numerous difficulties, with the most prominent issue being economic overheating, exacerbated by supply-demand imbalances and structural contradictions. The rapid growth of industry was not in sync with the slower development of agriculture, with the growth rate ratio of industry to agriculture being 6.7:1, far exceeding the normal ratio of 3:1. Within the industrial sector, there were irrational imbalances, with township enterprises and processing industries growing too rapidly, outpacing the development of raw materials, energy, and transportation. Railways have long been operating at full capacity.

	Due to excessive social demand, an excessive amount of currency was issued, leading to a sharp rise in prices and evident inflation. In 1988, the overall price level of social commodity retail prices rose by 18.5% compared to the previous year (December saw a 26.7% increase compared to the same month the previous year). Prices of vegetables, meat, poultry, eggs, and aquatic products rose by 31-37% compared to the previous year. Nationwide, residents spent an additional 125 billion yuan due to price increases, with approximately 34.9% of households experiencing a real income decrease solely due to price hikes.

　　我国经济去年喜忧交织
    经济实力进一步增强人民生活有提高
    经济过热产业结构失调通货膨胀明显
    本报北京２月２８日讯记者张国荣报道：国家统计局今天公布的统计公报表明：过去的一年，是我国国民经济异常活跃而不稳定的一年，也是喜忧交织的一年。
    透过“公报”人们可以看到，１９８８年我国国民经济在深化改革、加快对外开放中发展，经济实力进一步增强。据初步计算，全年国民生产总值１３８５３亿元，比上年增长１１．２％；国民收入１１５３３亿元，比上年增长１１．４％。农村经济持续发展，农村社会总产值比上年增长１２．９％；全国工业总产值比上年增长２０．７％，不包括村及村以下工业则增长１７．７％。一些重点电站、煤矿、铁路、港口建成投产，为发展经济增添后续能力。海关进出口货物总额首次突破１０００亿美元，比上年增长２４．４％。对外贸易方式趋向多样化，“贸易伙伴”趋向多元化。城乡居民收入有所增加，城镇居民平均每人可用于生活费收入为１１１９元，扣除生活费用价格上涨因素，实际增长１．２％。农民平均每人纯收入为５４５元，扣除商品性消费价格上涨因素，实际增长６．３％。
    近万言的统计“公报”也揭示了问题的另一面。过去的一年，我们遇到的困难比较多，突出的问题是经济过热，供求总量矛盾和结构性矛盾加剧。工业过快增长同农业低速发展不相适应，工业与农业的增长速度之比为６．７∶１，大大超过３∶１的正常比例。工业内部结构出现不合理倾斜，乡村工业、加工工业过快增长同原材料、能源、交通发展不相适应，铁路运输长期以来处于超负荷运转。
    由于社会需求过旺，去年货币超量发行，物价上涨过猛，出现了明显的通货膨胀。１９８８年社会商品零售价格总水平比上年上升１８．５％（１２月份比上年同月上升２６．７％），其中蔬菜、肉禽蛋、水产品价格比上年分别上升３１—３７％。全国居民因物价上涨多支出１２５０多亿元，约有３４．９％的居民家庭纯因物价上涨造成实际收入下降。
