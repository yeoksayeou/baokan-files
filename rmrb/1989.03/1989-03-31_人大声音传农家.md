The voice of the Seventh National People's Congress Second Session reached Pingluo County's Xinfeng Village in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. The farmers here are both relieved and worried, happy yet doubtful.

On the evening of March 20, County Party Secretary Li Guilin and County Agriculture and Forestry Bureau Director Wang Jigang visited the home of Xinfeng Village Party Branch Secretary Wu Wanren (Hui ethnicity). They found seven or eight village cadres and farmers watching the television news of the National People's Congress. The conversation naturally turned to agricultural issues.

Wu Wanren, who has been a village cadre for over 20 years, said, "In recent years, agricultural production in Xinfeng Village has been continuously developing. In 1988, the total grain output increased by 65% compared to 1987. Almost all households, except for a few with lower intelligence, have shaken off poverty. My experience is that rural prosperity depends on good Party policies, increased agricultural investment, and scientific and technological progress."

Li Guilin said, "Premier Li Peng mentioned at the National People's Congress that starting from April 1 this year, the contract purchase price for grain will be increased by 18%, and grain outside the contract purchase will be traded in the market with prices fluctuating according to supply and demand. I roughly calculated that just from the 'price adjustment,' farmers in all of Ningxia can earn an additional 46 million yuan."

Sitting nearby, Hui farmer Ma Wentai said, "My family of nine has six laborers. In 1988, we planted 30 mu of rice, 7 mu of wheat, 3 mu of sugar beets, and reclaimed 10 mu of wasteland. Last year, our gross income reached over 8,000 yuan, with a net income of over 4,000 yuan. This is something I never dared to imagine before. I originally planned to build a few new rooms this year, and the bricks and timber are all prepared, but to become a household with an income of 10,000 yuan, I will not build the new rooms for now and will reclaim tens of mu of wasteland to plant more grain."

Li Guilin said, "This year, the county has allocated 1 million yuan for agricultural production, but developing agriculture cannot rely solely on the state. If each of our 200,000 agricultural population in the county invests an additional 10 yuan, that would be 2 million yuan."

The atmosphere became more lively, and everyone chimed in, saying, "After hearing Premier Li Peng's report, we are confident in the higher authorities but worried about the middle level. We hope that the central spirit will be fully implemented here without any discount. The higher authorities have long advocated for the liberalization of grain procurement and market-oriented pricing. However, in Ningxia, it is still assigned to households as a task and purchased at a price slightly lower than the market price. This time, the central spirit must not be discounted again."

Nowadays, farmers think more deeply and broadly about national affairs.

　　人大声音传农家
    本报记者  黄翊明
    七届全国人大二次会议的声音传到宁夏回族自治区平罗县新丰村，这里的农民，放心中有担心，高兴中伴有疑虑。
    ３月２０日晚，县委书记李桂林和县农工部长王继恭来到新丰村党支部书记吴万仁（回族）家里，只见七八个村干部和农民正在收看全国人大会议的电视新闻。话题自然落到农业问题上来了。
    当了２０多年村干部的支部书记吴万仁说，这几年新丰村的农业生产不断发展。１９８８年粮食总产量比１９８７年提高６５％，全村除几户智力较差的外，都已经脱了贫。我的体会是，农村致富一要靠党的政策好，二要靠向农业投入多，三要靠科学技术。
    李桂林说，李鹏总理在全国人代会上说了，从今年４月１日起，提高合同订购粮价１８％，合同定购以外的粮食实行市场交易，价格随行就市。我粗略算了一下账，仅“议转平”这一部分，全宁夏农民就可以多收入４６００多万元。
    坐在一旁的回族农民马文才说，我一家九口人，六个劳动力，１９８８年种水稻３０亩，小麦７亩，甜菜３亩，还开了１０亩荒地。去年一年，毛收入就达８０００多元，纯收入４０００多元，这是我过去想都不敢想的。我原想今年盖几间新房，砖、木料都准备了，为了当个万元户，新房先不盖了，还要开几十亩荒地，多种点粮食。
    李桂林说，今年全县筹措了１００万元用于农业生产，但发展农业光靠国家也不行，如果我们县２０万农业人口，一人多投入１０元，就是２００万元。
    气氛越来越热烈，大伙儿七嘴八舌地说，听了李鹏总理的报告，我们是对上面放心，对中间“担心”，希望我们这里贯彻中央精神不打折扣。上面早就讲过，议购粮食要放开收购，价格随行就市。可我们宁夏还是作为任务下到农户，还要略低于市价收购。这一次贯彻中央精神千万不要再打折扣啦。
    现在的农民对国家大事想得更深更远了。
