Two sugar factories in Ningxia fined for underpriced purchase of sugar beets

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Yinchuan on March 8 (reporter Wu Guoqing), the Pingluo Sugar Factory and the Yinchuan Sugar Factory in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region were recently penalized by the autonomous region's price inspection bureau for underpriced purchase of sugar beets and deducting farmers' earnings. The two factories were ordered to return the 230,000-plus yuan of illegal earnings to the farmers and were fined 100,000 yuan and 20,000 yuan respectively.

	During the sugar beet purchasing period from October to December last year, the two factories violated the autonomous region's price bureau's regulations on sugar beet purchasing prices. They arbitrarily reduced prices at some purchasing stations, seriously harming the farmers' interests. The investigation found that the Pingluo Sugar Factory deducted 150,000-plus yuan from the farmers, and the Yinchuan Sugar Factory deducted 80,000-plus yuan.

　　压价收购甜菜
    宁夏两糖厂受罚
    据新华社银川３月８日电  （记者吴国清）宁夏回族自治区平罗糖厂和银川糖厂压价收购甜菜，克扣农民，最近被自治区物价检查所查处。两厂被责令将克扣农民的２３万多元非法所得如数归还农民，并被分别处以１０万和２万元罚款。
    这两家糖厂在去年１０月至１２月收购甜菜过程中，违犯自治区物价局关于甜菜收购价格的规定，在一些收购站擅自压价收购，严重损害了农民利益。经查，仅压价一项，平罗糖厂克扣农民金额达１５万余元，银川糖厂克扣农民８万多元。
