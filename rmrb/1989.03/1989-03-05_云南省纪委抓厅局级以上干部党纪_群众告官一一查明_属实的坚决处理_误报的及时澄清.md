The Communist Party of China Yunnan Provincial Committee Discipline Inspection Commission has thoroughly investigated all reports from the public regarding more than 60 department-level and above leaders in the province. They have clarified false reports and have taken decisive action against those found to have violated party discipline. So far, five individuals have received party disciplinary actions, and investigations into several others are ongoing.

In one case, a factory in Kunming, during its trial production phase, generated some income. A few leaders in the factory violated state regulations by taking out 150,000 yuan as a "reward" for the construction management department. Out of this amount, 50,000 yuan was given as a "reward" to the engineering command department and its leadership group members. More than ten department and section-level leaders each received extra income ranging from a few thousand to over ten thousand yuan. After the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission verified the facts, they ordered the full return of the "reward" money and disciplined the decision-makers. The whistleblower was commended.

Investigating leaders is often challenging, and the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission has faced numerous obstacles. However, they have adhered to the principle of dealing with issues based on facts and party discipline. In one instance, a bank manager collected vouchers and falsely claimed travel expenses, embezzling over 700 yuan. When the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission investigated, the bank manager created various obstacles. The commission persisted in its principles, working from multiple angles, and ultimately gave the bank manager a probationary party membership.

Recently, the Yunnan Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission has received multiple anonymous calls alleging that three leaders from the Provincial Committee, Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference, and Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee had used their positions to send their three sons and one son-in-law abroad at public expense. Upon investigation, it was found that out of the four individuals mentioned, only one was recommended by a scientific and technological department and passed a rigorous examination to go abroad. The other three were still working domestically, and their parents had not exerted any influence on their overseas trips. After clarifying the facts, and given the anonymity of the whistleblowers, the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission informed the relevant units about the actual situation, which may have misreported the incident.

　　云南省纪委抓厅局级以上干部党纪
    群众告官一一查明   
    属实的坚决处理　误报的及时澄清
    本报昆明３月４日电  新华社记者罗苹报道：中共云南省委纪律检查委员会，一一查实群众对全省厅局级以上６０余名领导干部的种种反映，对误传予以澄清，对违犯党纪的严肃处理，目前已给５人党纪处分，还在继续审理另几个人的问题。
    昆明一家工厂试生产期间有些收入，厂里少数领导人违反国家规定，擅自拿出１５万元“酬劳”基建主管部门，其中５万元“酬谢”工程指挥部及领导小组成员，１０多名局、处级以上领导干部每人收到上千元或数千元额外收入。省纪委查证核实后，责令如数收回“酬金”，并处分了决策者，表扬了举报人。
    查处领导干部难度较多，面对种种障碍，省纪委坚持依据事实论理、论纪。有个银行行长，搜罗单据，到本单位冒领出差旅费，贪污７００多元。省纪委查处时，他多方设置障碍。省纪委坚持原则，多方面做工作，最后给予这个行长留党察看处分。
    一段时间以来，云南省纪委连连接到匿名电话，反映省委、省顾委、人大常委会里的３名领导干部“利用职权”，已把３个儿子及一个女婿公费送出国。经查实，这４人中，只有１人由科技部门推荐经严格考试合格后出国，其余３人都还在国内工作，他们的父母都未为其出国施加任何影响。事实查清后，在举报人不明的情况下，省纪委将实情通报了可能误传此事的一些单位。
