Title: On "Notes"

In Kaifeng, where the first clean official in history, Judge Bao, once served as mayor, the Kaifeng Municipal Agricultural Materials Company, which specializes in fertilizers, received over 650 notes during the optimal period for applying fertilizer to wheat. Consequently, 40% of the total imported fertilizer was sold to speculators who did not need it, who then sold it to farmers at nearly double the price.

This is indeed news. Last year, due to natural disasters and the chaotic supply of fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films, as well as unreasonable prices, farmers' enthusiasm was affected. As leaders of a company supplying agricultural materials, they naturally would not know less than ordinary citizens, yet they did such a "self-destructive" thing. "Ignorance" or "bureaucratism" seems insufficient to describe this.

However, it is also not entirely news. As is well known, in addition to red-headed documents, black-headed documents, etc., there is another special type of document called "notes." The power of notes is immense! A large-scale construction project, despite not being beneficial to economic construction and not conforming to regulations, can be green-lighted with a single note. Thousands of televisions, refrigerators, school admissions, employment, promotions—all can be obtained with notes. Mountains crumble, rivers part. As for a few bags of fertilizer, it's a small matter. This time, the Kaifeng Municipal Agricultural Materials Company made the news on television and in newspapers, which is unfortunate. Even if Judge Bao were to return, I would be at a loss as to how he should use his axe.

The speculators' notes are not reports from people unknown to the company manager but are best from the manager's supervisor or influential figures. During the Tang Dynasty, the prime minister Yuan Zai had an uneducated relative who came to him seeking an official position. Reluctantly, Yuan Zai gave him a blank letter signed with "Yuan Zai" to take to the military governor of Youzhou. With this note, the relative not only enjoyed free meals but also received 1,000 bolts of silk.

Thus, notes are an ancient tradition. At least since the Tang Dynasty, we have had the term "guan jie," which means pulling strings or walking through the back door. "Constructing requests to influential figures is called guan jie" (Li Zhao, "Tang Dynasty Supplementary History"). The reason it is called guan jie is that it requires obtaining a note or introduction from an influential figure, just like passing through a checkpoint requires a pass. Notes are like passes. With the changes in the times, the names and uses of notes will also change. However, the essence remains the same: it is a symbol of power and money. Therefore, although the government repeatedly orders that fertilizers must not be resold, the manager, upon seeing a note, must comply.

Notes are tangible, which often leads to their drawbacks: once investigated, the notes are clear and visible. Who took how many notes from Secretary Zhang, who took how many notes from Director Li—all are clear. When the television broadcast, a stack of notes flashed on the screen, which is indeed a taboo for those who issue notes. "Once a word enters the official gate, nine oxen cannot pull it out." The infamous official Yuan Daicheng of the Ming Dynasty had foresight in this regard. Every time he went to pay respects to Wei Zhongxian, he bought back the name cards (also a kind of note) he gave from Wei's family members with money. Although Yuan Daicheng ultimately did not escape his infamous reputation, this trick was quite useful for him to avoid the purge of the Wei faction. Nowadays, with the advancement of science, there are intangible notes: telephone calls. Telephone calls are also notes.

When will we no longer have such tangible or intangible notes? From the Kaifeng fertilizer incident, if the names and identities of the 650-plus note issuers and the quantity are not publicly disclosed, if the speculators who made a fortune with notes are not severely punished, and if evil is still concealed and goodness is still praised, it can be imagined that those who seek notes and those who issue notes will be in harmony, continuing to seek and issue notes. If this cannot be suppressed, notes will only increase, and will they eventually become the rope that ties up reform? This concern is hopefully unnecessary.

　　说“条子”
    牧惠
    在天下第一清官包公当过市长的开封，专营化肥的开封市农业生产资料公司，在小麦追肥的佳期，收到批来的条子６５０余张，于是把总购进量４０％的化肥送到用不着化肥的倒爷手里，让他们以将近一倍的价钱出售给等着化肥用的农民。
    这确实是新闻。去年由于天灾也由于化肥、农药、薄膜的供应紊乱，加上价格的不合理，影响了农民的积极性。这种情况，身为供应农业生产资料的公司领导，自然不会比一般老百姓知道得少，却干出了这种“自焚长城”的事，“愚昧无知”或“官僚主义”这类帽子，显然不够用了。
    但是，它确实也未尽是新闻。众所周知，咱们这里，除了红头文件、黑头文件等等之外，还有一种特别的文件叫条子。条子的作用大矣哉！一项耗资巨大的建设工程，尽管对经济建设未必有好处，也不符合文件的规定，一张“条子”就可以绿灯盛开。上千台电视机、电冰箱，入学、就业、升官，同样条到擒来。逢山山倒，遇水成桥。至于三五袋化肥，更是小菜一碟。开封市农业生产资料公司这一回上了电视，上了报纸，算是倒霉。包大人再生，该如何使用铡刀，我也替他犯难。
    倒爷们奔的条子当然不是同公司经理素昧生平的人打的报告，而必须最好是经理的顶头上司或权要开的批条。唐朝宰相元载有位不学无术的亲戚来找他要官做。碍于情面，元载只好给他一封签有“元载”二字的空白信，让他持信去找幽州节度使。凭这张“条子”，这位亲戚足吃足喝外，还白拿了１０００匹绢。
    可见，条子也是古已有之的一种国粹。至少从唐开始，咱们就有了“关节”即走后门这个词。“造请权要，谓之关节”（李肇《唐国史补》）。之所以叫关节，就是它得取得权要的批条或介绍信也即是时下所谓条子，就像过关隘得有符节一样，条子即符节。随着时代的变化，条子的称呼形式及使用范围也会有变化。但是，万变不离宗：这是一种权力和金钱的象征。因此，虽然政府再三地下令不准倒卖化肥，经理见到条子，非得供应不行。
    条子是有形的，这就往往有它的弊端：一旦追查起来，条子历历在目，张书记批条子取走多少，李主任批条子取走多少，一清二楚。电视台播出时，一叠条子还在屏幕上晃了晃，这诚然是批条子者的大忌。“一字入公门，九牛拔不出”。明朝那位无耻透顶的阮大铖对此很有远见。他每次去拜谒魏忠贤时送去的名片（也是一种条子），都用钱从魏家家人那里买回。虽然，阮大铖最终脱不了臭名，但这一手对他逃避清洗魏党时很有点好处。如今科学发达，出现了无形的条子：电话，电话也是条子。
    什么时候我们才不会再有这种有形的或无形的条子呢？从开封的化肥事件看，如果不把这６５０余张条子的署名者和身份、数量一一公布，如果不把凭条子大赚其钱的倒爷狠加惩处，依旧隐恶扬善、宽大无边，可以想见，奔条子的和批条子的就会其乐也融融，照奔照批。抑制不住，条子越来越多，会不会终于变成把改革捆住的绳子？这一担心，但愿是多余的。
