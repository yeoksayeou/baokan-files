Those who have read the Greek "Homer's Epic" will have a deep impression of a folk healer named Asclepius praised in the poem. The healer holds a staff with a coiled serpent, travels around, and cures diseases, which is quite effective. Later generations, out of respect for the healer and the serpent, used the "serpent-wrapped staff" as a medical symbol, known as the "serpent emblem." Greece is the birthplace of the serpent emblem. From ancient times to the present, serpent emblems are found all over Greece. In modern times, even in scientifically advanced countries like Britain, France, Canada, as well as the United States, the Soviet Union, and the World Health Organization of the United Nations, all use the serpent emblem as the symbol for medical and pharmaceutical units. The cover of the "Chinese Medical Journal" published in April 1948 in China also prominently features a serpent emblem.

In ancient times, many regions used the serpent emblem as a symbol for medical and pharmaceutical units, which also reflects the ancient people's "totem worship" of snakes. According to the American anthropologist Morgan, among the Native American tribes in America, nine tribes use the snake as their national totem. Some ancient records in Australia show that ancient Australians held grand snake-worshipping ceremonies every year, with the Warlpiri people being the most prominent. During these ceremonies, men, women, and children would dress themselves in various colors to resemble snakes, sing songs praising snakes, and dance imitating snakes. As early as 600 years ago, Indians built a 10-foot-high statue in Mahabalipuram with seven large cobras on its back, which people worshipped as the supreme deity. The African people's worship of snakes is even more intense. The Sakalava people in the western part of Cameroon perform the "snake ring ceremony" for guests, placing a ring made of live snakes around the guest's neck as a blessing. The customs of snake worship among various ethnic groups around the world generally have beautiful legends, with the central idea being that snakes can bring good fortune and ward off disasters. Since medical and pharmaceutical units take it upon themselves to treat and save people, using the snake as a symbol is not surprising.

The medicinal value of snakes is extremely high. Snakes being used as symbols for medical and pharmaceutical units is indeed fitting.

### 蛇年谈蛇徽

　　蛇年谈蛇徽
    凡读过希腊“荷马史诗”的人，对诗文中赞颂的一个民间神医阿斯扣雷会留下深刻的印象。神医手持一根盘绕灵蛇的拐杖，云游四方，治病救人，十分灵验。后世出于神医和灵蛇的崇敬，就把“蛇绕拐杖”作为医学标志，称之为“蛇徽”。希腊是“蛇徽”的发源地。从古到今，蛇徽遍布希腊各地。到了近代，即使科学发达的英国、法国、加拿大，乃至美国、苏联和联合国世界卫生组织，也都以蛇徽作为医药单位标志。我国１９４８年４月出版的《中华医学杂志》，封面也是一个赫然醒目的蛇徽。
    古代众多地区以蛇徽作医药单位标志，也是古人对蛇的“图腾崇拜”的反映。据美国人类学家摩尔根考察，在美洲印地安人中，有９个部落以蛇作本民族的“图腾”。澳洲一些古籍记载，古澳洲人每年都举办盛大的拜蛇仪式，尤以华伦姆格人为最，届时男女老少都用五颜六色把自己装扮成蛇的模样，唱颂蛇之歌，跳仿蛇之舞。早在６００多年前，印度人就在马哈巴利普兰建造了一座高１０英尺、背上有７条巨大眼镜蛇的神像，人们把它奉为至高无上的神灵。非洲人对蛇的崇拜程度更甚。喀麦隆西部的撒可民拉人，待客要施“蛇环礼”，把一个用活蛇做的环套在客人脖子上，以示对客人的祝福。世界各地民族崇拜蛇的习俗，大都有美好的传说，其中心意思是说蛇能使人消灾纳福。医药单位以治病救人为己任，因而以蛇为标志就不奇怪了。
    蛇的药用价值极高。蛇被用来做医药单位的标志，确也当之无愧。
