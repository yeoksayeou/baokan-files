Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 19th.

The spokesperson for the National People's Congress meeting, Deputy Secretary-General Yao Guang, introduced the main agenda of the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress and answered questions from reporters at a press conference held today for both Chinese and foreign journalists.

When discussing the drafts of the Administrative Litigation Law and the Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress submitted to the meeting for deliberation, Yao Guang said that the Administrative Litigation Law will further protect the legal rights of citizens, maintain and supervise the lawful exercise of administrative power, and improve the efficiency of administrative work. The Rules of Procedure of the National People's Congress is a procedural law for the highest organ of state power to exercise its functions and powers, which is conducive to further promoting democracy and improving the efficiency of deliberations.

Yao Guang said that the press center of the meeting will do its best to provide convenience for the more than 640 Chinese and foreign journalists covering the meeting and will arrange for multiple press conferences, inviting leaders of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, and relevant departments to meet with the journalists. He especially welcomed the 18 Taiwanese journalists who came to Beijing specifically to cover the meeting.

In response to a reporter's question about the democratic process, Yao Guang said that in recent years, people's congresses at all levels have done a lot of work for the construction of democracy and the rule of law. China needs a peaceful international environment and a stable and united political situation at home; otherwise, it will not be able to carry out construction and reform, and the achievements already made will be lost.

In response to a question from a reporter of the United Press International about whether the meeting will discuss the proposal to implement a general amnesty on the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, Yao Guang said that according to the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has the power to decide on amnesty. At present, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has not considered this issue. In my personal opinion, given the current situation in China, there is no need to consider amnesty. As for Chinese citizens writing to the National People's Congress and giving suggestions to the government, this is legal, but we do not approve of attempts to use foreign forces to exert pressure on the government of one's own country.

A reporter asked whether two vice chairpersons will be elected to fill the vacancies left by the deaths of Ulanfu and Panchen. Yao Guang said that at the first session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the chairperson and vice chairpersons of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress were nominated by the Communist Party of China after full consultation with various democratic parties and social organizations and then recommended to the presidium of the meeting. So far, I have not heard of any consultations on the nomination of vice chairpersons, so it seems that there will be no election of vice chairpersons at this meeting.

　　人大会议新闻发言人向记者说
    中国需要安定团结局面   
    就是否特赦及补选副委员长问题作了回答
    本报北京３月１９日讯  记者王谨、莫新元报道：七届人大二次会议新闻发言人、大会副秘书长姚广在今天召开的中外记者招待会上，介绍了七届人大二次会议的主要议程，回答了记者的提问。
    在谈到提交大会审议的行政诉讼法和全国人大议事规则草案时，姚广说，行政诉讼法将进一步保障公民的合法权益，维护和监督依法行使行政权，提高行政工作的效率；人大议事规则是一部国家最高权力机关行使职权的程序法，有利于进一步发扬民主，提高议事效率。
    姚广说，大会新闻中心将尽可能多地为采访大会的６４０多名中外记者提供方便，并将安排多次记者招待会，请全国人大常委会、国务院领导和有关部委负责人分别会见记者。他特别对１８名专程来北京采访大会的台湾记者表示欢迎。
    在回答记者关于民主进程的提问时，姚广说，近几年来各级人民代表大会，为民主法制建设做了大量工作。中国在国际上需要一个和平的国际环境，在国内需要一个安定团结的政治局面，否则就无法进行建设和改革，已取得的成绩也会丧失。　　在回答美国合众国际社记者关于大会是否讨论有人提出在国庆４０周年实行大赦的问题时，姚广说，根据我国宪法，全国人大常委会有权决定特赦。现在全国人大常委会没有考虑这个问题。我个人认为，根据我国目前情况，不需要考虑特赦。至于中国公民给全国人大写信，向政府提出意见，是合法的，但是对企图借外国势力对本国政府施加压力，这是我们不赞成的。
    有记者问，乌兰夫、班禅副委员长逝世后，是否会补选两位副委员长？姚广说，在七届全国人大一次会议上，全国人大常委会委员长、副委员长人选，是中共中央经过同各民主党派、各社会团体充分协商后向大会主席团推荐的。至今，我没有听说就副委员长的提名进行过协商，看来本次会议上不会补选副委员长。
