	Researchers from West Germany's "Lufthansa" airline used computers to analyze and find that human error accounted for 76% of the causes of airplane accidents over the past 30 years.

	From 1959 to the present, there have been 496 air disasters, resulting in 15,198 deaths. The majority of these disasters occurred during takeoff and landing, with the quality of the pilots being the main issue.

	The research report indicates that the best year was 1984, with only 3 planes crashing, while the worst year was 1983, with 23 planes crashing. Over 30 years, 23.7% of the crashes occurred during takeoff, 32.1% occurred just before reaching the destination, and 24.7% occurred during landing. Only 11% of the crashes were due to mechanical failures.

	In cases of human error, 25% were due to pilots lacking discipline; 20% were due to pilots being inattentive or fatigued; and 50% were due to pilots making operational errors, misjudgments, or lacking experience and training.

	The research report emphasizes that improving the quality of pilots to reduce airplane accidents is an urgent task for all airlines.

　　３０年数百飞机缘何坠毁
    本报讯  西德“汉莎”航空公司研究人员通过电脑统计和分析，了解到人为错误占３０年来飞机失事原因的７６％。
    自１９５９年迄今，共有４９６次空难事件，死亡人数共计１５１９８人。绝大部分灾难发生在飞机升空和降落之际，驾驶员的素质问题是主要原因。
    研究报告表明最好的年份是１９８４年，只有３架飞机坠毁，１９８３年最糟，失事飞机达２３架。３０年中，飞机在起飞时失事的占２３．７％，在即将到达目的地时坠毁的占３２．１％，在降落时失事的占２４．７％。因机械原因失事的只占１１％。
    在人为的错误中，２５％是由于驾驶员纪律性差；２０％由于驾驶员注意力不集中或疲劳；５０％由于驾驶员操纵技术错误，判断错误或缺乏经验与训练。
    研究报告指出大力提高驾驶员素质以减少飞机失事是各民航公司的迫切任务。
