Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 10th.

The Central Military Commission has recently formally replied to the Navy's report, determining April 23, 1949, as the Navy's establishment day.

On April 23, 1949, the People's Liberation Army occupied the Nationalist Party's presidential palace in Nanjing. Following orders from the Central Military Commission, the East China Military Region's Navy was established in Baima Temple, Taizhou, Jiangsu Province. Comrade Zhang Aiping was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief and Political Commissar, marking the addition of a new military branch to our army. On April 14, 1950, according to the orders from the Central Military Commission, the Navy's leadership headquarters was established in Beijing, "to unify the management and command of the people's navy and existing vessels in various places." Currently, our Navy has become a military branch composed of submarine forces, surface fleet forces, air forces, coastal defense forces, and marine corps forces.

　　中央军委批准确定
    海军成立日“四·二三”
    本报北京三月十日讯  中国人民解放军海军成立于何时？最近，中央军委已正式批复海军的报告，确定一九四九年四月二十三日为海军成立日。
    一九四九年四月二十三日，恰值人民解放军占领南京国民党总统府。奉中央军委电令，我华东军区海军在江苏泰州白马庙成立，张爱萍同志任司令员兼政治委员，这标志着我军又增加了一个新的军种。一九五零年四月十四日，根据中央军委电令，海军领导机关在京成立，“统一管理指挥各地人民海军及现有舰艇”。目前，我海军已成为拥有潜艇部队、水面舰艇部队、航空兵部队、岸防部队、陆战部队等兵种组成的军种。
