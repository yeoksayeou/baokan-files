The speed of socialist construction is rapid. The task of constructing 10,000 kilometers of highways, as stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan, was completed ahead of schedule by the end of 1955. Now, due to the rapid development of agricultural cooperation and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce throughout the country, China will build more than 100,000 kilometers of roads in the next two years and basically complete the local transportation network within seven years. For us highway workers, this is truly the most glorious and great task in history!

This task is arduous, but we highway workers have full confidence in completing it. Because our conditions are so good.

Under the care of the Party and Chairman Mao, our technical personnel are constantly growing in practice. In the early days of liberation, highway engineers considered it a difficult task to erect a steel bridge with a span of more than 10 meters or to survey a mountain 300 or 400 meters high. Now, even erecting all kinds of large bridges and surveying mountains more than 1,000 meters high are considered nothing major. In the past, it took several months to blast open a rocky mountain pass; now, with just over ten days of effort and a few explosions, it can be leveled. The technical level of our highway workers has improved. At the same time, through various movements and political studies, our political awareness has also improved. In this way, a group of backbone forces has emerged in the field of highways.

We have the assistance and support of the people of the whole country and the People's Liberation Army. No matter how remote the area, they guide us and open the way for us.

We have the help of Soviet experts and can use Soviet advanced technical data and standard drawings, which have improved our technical level, reduced our surveying and design time, and freed up manpower for us to complete more tasks.

This is our guarantee for completing the new task. However, in order to complete the new task, these conditions alone are not enough. Here, the highway department is also required to do several things. Since I have worked on the Kangzang Highway for a long time and have some understanding of the work and life of field workers, I would also like to offer some suggestions in this regard.

First, we must strive to adjust the distribution of technical forces in national highway institutions. In old China, the development of highways was initially concentrated in the provinces south of the Yangtze River. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, a part of the technical personnel went to the southwest. In the years after liberation, there were slight adjustments. But in terms of the engineering bureaus and design sub-bureaus directly under the Highway General Bureau, there is still a large number of people who are good at surveying and designing in the engineering bureaus. These surveying and design talents should be concentrated in one place, otherwise, they will not be able to meet the requirements of the work. This requires a good adjustment of the technical personnel of the engineering bureau and the transportation departments of various provinces. Otherwise, technical personnel will be scattered everywhere, standard drawings will not be formulated, and surveying and design will lag behind the requirements of construction for a long time, which will increase the difficulties for the new task of building highways in the future.

Second, the use of university students and junior training class students needs to be reconsidered, properly arranged, and boldly promoted. Up to now, in our surveying teams, there are still many university students engaged in the surveying and mapping of centerlines, levels, and topography; and many students from junior training classes have already learned surveying and mapping work, but they are still working as surveyors, doing the work of staking and targeting, which can be done by temporarily trained workers. In addition, the route selection and investigation work of many surveying teams is still undertaken by some senior engineers. If this continues, the senior engineers will gradually weaken and become unsupported, and the surveying and design team will be weakened, making it difficult to adapt to the massive road construction tasks under the new situation.

Third, insufficient training of technical personnel is a major shortcoming. In particular, highway engineering personnel engaged in surveying, design, and construction are in the deep mountains and wilderness for a long time, leaving early and returning late. Bending curves, drawing straight lines, calculating and drawing always race against time day and night. Life is hard, and political study and technical research are very occasional. In this way, it is very difficult to improve political and technical levels. As for the technical personnel in the organs, they are often too busy due to frequent changes in plans, unclear division of labor, and numerous meetings, large and small, and cannot sit down and think about some more important technical measures. These are all areas that should be improved.

Fourth, highway construction is a complex and extremely decentralized task, especially the places where the surveying team personnel go are mostly remote frontiers. Therefore, political instructors are set up in each surveying team to grasp the political education of all team members and promote labor competitions. However, the political instructors of some surveying teams are not of high level and do not do their work well, so that the political atmosphere in the surveying team is very thin. Some people strongly request to join the Party organization, but they do not get timely help and cultivation.

Fifth, highway workers are often separated from their families, sometimes for several years without returning home. Some family members, therefore, have misunderstandings and cause family disputes. In order to stabilize the work mood of the staff who are far away from home, I think that organizing family members to study, strengthening the management of these family members, and timely solving their living difficulties are things that the administration and trade unions should do.

I hope that the above-mentioned problems can be solved as soon as possible, and I believe that they will be gradually solved in the near future.

    公路方面的技术人员有些什么要求
    交通部公路总局设计局代理总工程师　李昌源
    社会主义建设的速度是飞快的。第一个五年计划给我们规定的建设1万公里公路的任务，已经在1955年年底提前完成了。现在，由于全国农业合作化和资本主义工商业改造的迅速发展，我国在最近两年间还要建筑10多万公里道路，7年内基本上完成地方交通网。对于我们公路工作者来说，这真是有史以来最光荣而伟大的任务！
    这个任务是艰巨的，但我们公路工作者完全有信心完成它。因为我们的条件是太好了。
    在党和毛主席的关怀之下，我们技术人员都在实践中不断地成长着。解放初期，架设10多公尺一孔的钢架桥，测量一座三、四百公尺高的山，公路工程师就觉得是一件难事。现在，就是架设各种大桥，测量1，000多公尺高的大山，也都觉得算不得大事了。以前，一个石山嘴要几个月才炸得开；现在只要有10多天的功夫，放几个炮，就削平了。我们公路工作者的技术水平是提高了。同时，通过各种运动和政治学习，我们的政治觉悟也提高了。这样在公路方面就涌现出了一批骨干力量。
    我们有全国人民和人民解放军的协助和支援。不论在任何边远的地区，他们都给我们引路开路。
    我们有苏联专家的帮助，有苏联的先进技术资料和标准图纸，可供利用，这就提高了我们的技术水平，减少了我们的测量设计时间，使我们腾出人力来完成更多的任务。
    这就是我们完成新的任务的保证。但是，为了完成新的任务，单单这些条件还是不够的。这里，还要求公路部门作几件事情。由于我长期在康藏公路工作，对野外工作人员的工作和生活情形有些了解，所以也想在这方面提些意见。
    第一，要努力调整全国公路机构中技术力量的分配。在旧中国，公路的发展，初期集中在长江以南各省。抗日战争中间，才有一部分技术人员到了西南。解放以后的几年间，稍有调动。但以公路总局直属的工程局和设计分局来讲，长于测量设计的人材就还有很大的数目保存在工程局。而这些测量设计人材是应当集中一处工作的，否则就不能适应工作的要求。这就须要把工程局、各省交通厅的技术人员好好加以调整。否则，技术人员分散各地，而标准图纸制定不起来，测量设计就会长期地赶不上施工的要求，这就会给今后建设公路的新任务增加困难。
    第二，对于大学生和初级训练班学生的使用，须要重新考虑，妥善安排，放手提拔。到现在为止，在我们的测量队里，还有很多大学生担任着中线水平和地形等等的测绘工作；而初级训练班的学生，很多人已经学会了测绘工作，却仍然在当测工，作那种可由临时训练的工人所能担任的打桩对点工作。另外，很多测量队的选线调查工作，仍然由一些老工程师担任着，长此下去，老工程师日渐衰弱不支了，测量设计队伍就日益削弱，很难适应新形势下的大量筑路任务。
    第三，对技术人员培养不够，是很大的缺点。尤其是担任测量设计和施工的公路工程人员，长期在深山旷野，早出晚归。弯道直线，计算绘图，总是夜以继日地在赶任务，生活艰苦，政治学习和技术研究，是很偶然的事。这样，政治和技术水平的提高就是很困难的了。至于机关里的技术人员，往往因为计划多变，分工不明，加上大会小会，也很忙乱，不能静坐下来，思考一些比较重要的技术措施。这都是应该改进的地方。
    第四，公路建设是复杂而又极端分散的工作，尤其是测量队的人员所到的地方，大都是荒野边疆。因此，在每一个测量队里面，都设置了政治指导员以掌握全队人员的政治教育，并且推动劳动竞赛。但是有些测量队的政治指导员，水平不高，工作作得不好，以致测量队里的政治空气非常稀薄，有些人强烈地要求参加党的组织，也得不到及时的帮助和培养。
    第五，公路工作人员经常同他们的家属分开，有时数年不能回家。有些家属就因此发生误会，引起家庭纠纷。为了安定离家远走的工作人员的工作情绪，我认为组织家属学习，加强对这些家属的管理，并且及时解决她们的生活困难，是行政和工会方面所应举办的事。
    以上说的这些问题，我希望能够早些解决，而且相信在不久的将来就会逐步得到解决。
