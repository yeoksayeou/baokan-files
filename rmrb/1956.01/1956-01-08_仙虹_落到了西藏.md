　　“Immortal Rainbow” Lands in Tibet
    Xiao Jun
    There is a village called Wusijiang in the Gongbu area of Tibet. It is nestled in the embrace of mountains, and in the past, the villagers used leaves as tea. Since the opening of the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways, merchants have frequented this village, bringing the villagers various daily necessities and inexpensive tea produced in the interior of the motherland. The villagers are also able to sell their own local products. When the villagers recall this change in their lives, they say: Since the opening of the highway, the "immortal rainbow" has fallen from the sky to the earth, and life has become much better!
    The words of the villagers of Wusijiang accurately express the feelings of the Tibetan people. When the Kang-Tibet and Qing-Tibet highways were about to open, they called the highways "golden bridges" and "belts of happiness," wishing that they would bring happiness to the Tibetan people. The facts of the past year show that the wishes of the Tibetan people are being realized.
    From the day the two highways opened, hundreds of vehicles began to run on the highway lines all year round. In the past, every spring and winter, when heavy snow blocked the mountains, the exchange of goods in the Tibetan area came to a standstill. However, in the spring and winter of 1955, cars loaded with various materials broke through the ice peaks and snow ridges and came to Tibet from the distant interior. Before the opening of the highway, merchants in the Tibetan area could only import goods from the interior once or twice a year. Now, with the use of cars to transport goods, they can import goods three to four times a year. In 1955, the Tibet Trade Corporation transported more than three times as many goods of various kinds from the interior to Lhasa as in 1954. Among them, tea alone amounted to more than 7.5 million catties, which is much more than the 4.5 million catties of tea imported in the year with the largest amount of tea imported in Tibetan history. The variety of goods has also increased from dozens to about one thousand since the opening of the highway.
    With the increase in materials transported to Tibet through the highway, the ancient commercial centers of Lhasa, Xigaze, Qamdo, and Gyantse have become more prosperous, and new commercial centers, such as Zhamu in the Bomi area, are gradually forming.
    Heihe, which has prospered along with the Qing-Tibet Highway, has become the center of material exchange in northern Tibet. Herdsmen living on the source of the Yellow River in Amdo, who buy horses and those in the Tongtian River area, used to live solely on wild livestock, but now they can buy rice and tea transported from the interior. In the high mountains of Tibet, there are various precious medicinal materials, such as anemarrhena, fritillaria, musk, deer antler, caterpillar fungus, and lynx skin. On the vast grasslands, there are millions of cattle and sheep, producing millions of catties of wool annually, as well as cowhide, cow tails, and so on. In the past, due to inconvenient transportation, these precious local products could not be sold outside. Since the opening of the highway, state-owned trading organizations in various places have vigorously carried out material exchange and procurement through merchants, and have begun to change the past habit of commodity exchange once a year in many places, enabling farmers and herdsmen to exchange various local products for grain, tea, and other necessities in a timely manner. In 1955, the value of local products purchased by the state reached several million yuan, which not only supported the country's socialist construction but also improved the living standards of the Tibetan people. For example, Losang Dunzhu, a herdsman in the northern Tibetan pastoral area, can shear more than 870 catties of wool every year. Before liberation, this wool often could not be exchanged for anything; after liberation, it could at most be exchanged for 48 bricks of tea. In 1955, after the opening of the highway, he exchanged the same amount of wool for 150 bricks of tea.
    In the past year, prices in the Tibetan region have also stabilized and are gradually decreasing. The Tibet Trade Corporation has reduced prices three times in the past year. Taking Lhasa as an example, in the first quarter of 1955, the prices of 462 commodities decreased by an average of more than 10%, and in the second quarter, the prices of 38 commodities decreased by an average of more than 13%. In December, tea prices were reduced across the board in various parts of Tibet. Tuo tea, which is loved by the majority of the people, has been reduced in price by more than 26%.
    The happiness brought to the Tibetan people by the opening of the Qing-Tibet and Kang-Tibet highways in the past year is endless. As the Tibetan people sing: "Chairman Mao's cars have come, people are very happy; Cattle and sheep are raised in flocks, and wool turns into gold. Animal skins are as precious as brocade, and a happy life takes root forever!"

### “仙虹”落到了西藏

　　“仙虹”落到了西藏
    肖俊
    西藏工布地区有一个叫乌斯江的村子。它在大山的群抱之中，过去村民们都用树叶来当茶叶吃。自从康藏、青藏公路通车以后，这个村子里常有商贩来往，他们给村民们带来了祖国内地生产的各种生活必需品和廉价的茶叶，村民们也能够把自己手中的土特产品卖出。村民们回忆起生活中这种变化的时候说：公路通车以后，“仙虹”从天上落到地上，日子好过得多了！
    乌斯江村村民的话，确切地表达了西藏人民的心情。当康藏、青藏公路快要通车的时候，他们就把公路称为“金桥”和“幸福的带子”，预祝它能够给藏族人民带来幸福。一年来的事实说明，藏族人民的愿望正在实现。
    从两条公路通车的那一天起，几百辆汽车便开始终年奔驰在公路线上。过去，每年春、冬大雪封山的时候，西藏地区的物资交流便陷于停滞状态。可是在1955年的春天和冬季，满载各种物资的汽车却冲过了冰峰雪岭，从遥远的内地来到了西藏。公路通车前，西藏地区的商人一年只能从内地进货一次到两次。现在，用汽车运货，一年可以进货三次到四次。西藏贸易总公司1955年从内地运到拉萨的各种货物，比1954年增加了三倍多。其中仅茶叶一项就有750多万斤，比西藏历史上运进茶叶最多的一年——450万斤，还多好多。货物的品种也由通车前的几十种增加到一千种左右。
    通过公路运到西藏的物资增加了，古老的商业中心——拉萨、日喀则、昌都、江孜等更加繁荣了，新的商业中心，如波密地区的扎木等，正在逐渐形成。
    跟青藏公路一同繁荣起来的黑河，已经成为藏北物资交流的中心。住在黄河源上安多买马、通天河地方的牧民，过去专靠吃野牲畜过日子，现在可以从这里买到内地运来的大米和茶叶。在西藏的崇山峻岭中，盛产各种珍贵的药材，如知母、贝母、麝香、鹿茸、虫草、猞猁皮等。在广阔的草原上，有几百万头牛羊，年产几百万斤羊毛，还有牛皮、牛尾等等。过去，因为交通不便，这些珍贵的土特产品都没法外销。公路通车以后，各地国营贸易机构都通过商人大力开展了物资的交换和收购工作，开始改变了过去许多地方一年一次的商品交换习惯，使农、牧民们及时地用各种土特产品来换粮食、茶叶等生活必需品。1955年，国家收购的土特产品价值达几百万元，不仅支援了国家的社会主义建设，也提高了藏族人民的生活水平。例如，藏北牧区牧民洛桑顿珠，每年可剪羊毛870多斤。解放前，这些羊毛常常是换不到东西的；解放后最多也不过换砖茶48块。1955年，公路通车以后，他用同样多的羊毛却换到了砖茶150块。
    一年来，西藏地区的物价也稳定了，并且在逐步下降。西藏贸易总公司在最近一年中曾经三次降低了物价。以拉萨为例，1955年第一季度有462种商品的价格平均降低了10％多，第二季度有38种商品平均降低了13％还多。12月份，在西藏各地，又全面地降低了茶叶价格。为大多数人民所喜爱的沱茶，价格降低了26％多。
    青藏，康藏两条公路通车一年中，给西藏人民带来的幸福是说不完的。正如西藏人民所歌唱的：“毛主席的汽车来了，人们多欢心；牛羊养成群，羊毛变成金。兽皮贵如锦，幸福生活永生根！”
