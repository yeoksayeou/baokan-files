Finding Ways to Increase Production Depends on People
Liu Xi

The Leitun Township Xiaoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anshun County, Guizhou Province, has been operating for more than two years. The attendance rate of its members has been increasing, and production has increased in both years. However, the development of production has also brought new problems. Because intensive cultivation is insufficient and the cultivated area has not been expanded, the increase in production cannot meet the requirements of the members for more work and more income. As a result, some members have the illusion that "the potential has been fully tapped, there is no way to increase production, and there is no hope of increasing production by relying on cooperatives." Some old cooperatives in other parts of the township also have this situation.

In order to solve this problem, the Leitun Township Branch of the Chinese Communist Party, in its production plan, organized more than 20 Party members, League members, and proactive farmers, divided them into two survey groups to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the land's production potential in the fields, and to look for resources in the mountains. After five days of surveying, they found 18 plots of wasteland totaling more than 1,200 mu that could be used to grow 11 kinds of crops, as well as more than 8,000 mu of wasteland that could be used for afforestation, and seven water sources that could irrigate more than 1,000 mu of farmland. Some people believe that trees cannot be planted on rocky mountains, and that seeds sown on barren slopes will not yield grain. After on-the-spot investigations, they discovered that there was a peach tree more than one person tall on a rocky mountain four miles away from Leitun Township, which had already produced peaches in the summer of 1955. Xiong Maoqing, the production committee member of the Leitun Second Agricultural Production Cooperative, had also tried to open up a piece of wasteland on the edge of the mountain, and harvested seven dou of corn and a lot of indigo, the yield of which was not much lower than that of cultivated land. These facts prove that wasteland can grow grain, rocky mountains can also be planted with trees, and the production potential of mountainous areas is great. By carefully calculating accounts and finding production loopholes, they found that the production potential of the existing land was also great. For example, some of the first-class fields of the Xiaoshan Agricultural Production Cooperative yielded 961 jin per dan, while others yielded only 723 jin; if the shortcomings in cultivation could be overcome and the yield could reach the level of 961 jin, the increase in production for the entire township would be astonishing. The township branch also educated the members with practical examples of increasing production by applying more fertilizer, improving the soil, preventing pests, promoting new farm tools, and expanding the area of early spring crops, and helped the cooperative to make a production plan, thereby breaking the members' conservative thinking of "reaching the peak of production."

From the above facts, it seems that the production potential of rural areas is great, and the conservative thinking of "reaching the peak of production" is unfounded. The method of the Leitun Township Party Branch of Anshun County, Guizhou Province, to educate the members of agricultural cooperatives to break conservative thinking and make good production plans is a method worth promoting. At present, agricultural cooperatives in various places are carrying out production planning. The staff of rural grassroots organizations in various places should adopt the method of Leitun Township, actively lead the members of agricultural cooperatives to tap production potential, break conservative thinking, and make good production plans.

    增产门路靠人找
    刘希
    贵州省安顺县雷屯乡小山农业生产合作社办了两年多，社员出勤率不断增加，两年都增加了生产。但是，生产的发展也带来了新的问题。因为精耕细作不够和耕地面积没有扩大，增产的数量满足不了社员的多出工、多增加收入的要求。这样，有些社员就产生了错觉，以为“潜力挖光增产无门，再靠合作社增加生产是没有指望的了”。这个乡别的一些老社也都有这种情况。
    为了解决这个问题，中共雷屯乡支部在生产规划中，组织20多个党员、团员和农民积极分子，分成两个勘察组到田间实地调查土地的增产潜力，到山上寻找资源。经过五天的勘察，他们找到了18处约1，200多亩可种11种农作物的荒地，还有八千多亩可供造林的荒地，有可灌溉田一千多亩的七处水源。有的人认为岩石山不能栽树，荒坡土瘦撒了种子不长粮。经过实地勘察，他们发现在离雷屯乡四里的岩石山上有一棵一人多高的桃树，1955年夏天已经结了桃子。雷屯第二农业生产合作社生产委员熊茂清也曾在山边试开了一块荒地，收了七斗玉米，还有很多土靛，产量比熟地低不了好多。这些事实证明，荒地可以长粮，岩山也可以栽树，山区的生产潜力是很大的。通过算细账，找生产漏洞，他们发现原有土地的增产潜力也很大。例如小山农业生产合作社的一等田，有的每石产量达961斤，有的只收723斤；如果能克服耕作中的缺点，使产量都达到961斤的水平，全乡增产的数字就很惊人。乡支部还用增施肥料、改良土壤、防止虫害、推广新式农具、扩大早春作物面积等增产的实际事例教育社员，帮助合作社作出了生产规划，从而打破了社员“增产到顶”的保守思想。
    从上述事实看来，农村生产潜力是很大的，“增产到顶”的保守思想是没有根据的。贵州省安顺县雷屯乡的党支部教育农业合作社的社员打破保守思想，搞好生产规划的办法，是一种值得提倡的办法。目前各地农业合作社都在进行生产规划，各地农村基层组织的工作人员，应该采用雷屯乡的办法，积极地领导农业合作社的社员挖掘生产潜力，打破保守思想，搞好生产规划。
