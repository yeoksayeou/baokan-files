Strengthen the Prediction and Forecasting of Crop Diseases and Pests
    Shu Yannan
    Eliminating pests and diseases is like fighting a battle; we must organize campaigns. Prediction and forecasting are like gathering intelligence for organizing campaigns, predetermining the areas where pests and diseases will occur, the time of their occurrence, and their development trends. This work is an important basis for formulating prevention and control plans, and it is a crucial link in correctly organizing campaigns and effectively eliminating pests and diseases.
    Our country's prediction and forecasting of crop diseases and pests began after liberation. In terms of locust control, provinces in locust areas have successively carried out this work, with an annual survey area of about 10 million mu. Some areas have done a good job in locust detection, such as the Xinhailian City and Yuntai District of Guanyun County in Jiangsu Province, which can achieve basic accuracy in prediction.
    In the prevention and control of wheat gall midge, Henan, Shaanxi and other provinces have been able to predict the emergence period and degree of damage of wheat gall midge, and determine the scope and appropriate time for prevention and control. In 1955, Shaanxi Province established a prediction and forecasting system from top to bottom, and based on the observation of 399 information points, predicted the area of occurrence and the possible degree of damage of gall midge, which played a certain role in correctly guiding prevention and control work.
    In the prevention and control of armyworms, since the establishment of the armyworm forecasting system in many areas of Northeast China in 1953, the time for preventing and controlling armyworms has been advanced by ten days to half a month each year. Due to the early prevention and control time, it is possible to change from catching and killing larvae to catching moths and collecting eggs, which greatly reduces the damage of armyworms.
    The prediction of rice stem borers has also begun in the Jiangnan rice area. Zhejiang Province has full-time cadres responsible for the work of the prediction station. These stations have had six years of systematic observation and can partially grasp the occurrence and development of rice stem borers.
    Regarding the prediction and forecasting of cotton aphids and potato late blight, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and other provinces have also achieved certain results and experience.
    Generally speaking, prediction and forecasting is still a new work in most areas. Based on the experience of some areas in recent years, to carry out this work, first of all, it is necessary to organize a mass-based disease and pest information network. Pests and diseases are widely distributed and there are many types. Due to differences in climate, soil, cultivation system, and prevention and control foundation, the distribution and occurrence of pests and diseases are also different in different regions; even in the same region, due to changes in climate, natural enemies and other aspects, the occurrence and development of pests and diseases are different every year. If we do not actively rely on the masses, it is impossible to grasp the overall situation by relying solely on a few people in the prediction and forecasting stations. The peasant masses directly participate in agricultural production, and they can often observe the activities of pests and diseases when they are engaged in field operations. Therefore, only by relying on them can we widely obtain the most practical information on pests and diseases. In the process of prediction and forecasting, all localities should attach importance to this force and rely on them to form a disease and pest information network. The broad masses of peasants have rich experience in fighting against pests and diseases. They are familiar with the local situation, and can often make accurate judgments on the occurrence and development of major pests and diseases in the local area. This is their valuable experience accumulated through many years of practical testing. We should summarize and improve these experiences as a reference for carrying out our pest prediction and forecasting work.
    Secondly, there must be close cooperation between scientific research departments and meteorological departments. Prediction and forecasting work is based on a scientific basis. Correct prediction and forecasting should master sufficient data and understand the characteristics and occurrence patterns of pests and diseases. The acquisition of these materials mainly depends on scientific research departments. Meteorological changes are one of the most important reasons affecting the occurrence and development of pests and diseases. Without meteorological forecasts, accurate pest forecasts cannot be made; long-term forecasts of pest occurrence must also be reliable with long-term meteorological forecasts.
    Thirdly, we must strengthen the leadership of prediction and forecasting work. In addition to setting up long-term prediction and forecasting stations in areas with representative pest and disease occurrence and cultivation systems, specifically implementing observation and recording methods for prediction and forecasting, conducting systematic investigation and observation and making forecasts, agricultural departments should also lead agricultural technology extension stations, state-owned farms and other production units to do a good job in pest and disease information work.
    Fourth, we must pay attention to the work of accumulating data. Prediction and forecasting is a long-term task, and it requires the accumulation of data for many years. Correct forecasts require not only the current year's observation records in various regions, but also the comparison of past data. The longer this work is carried out, the more data is accumulated, and the more confident the prediction will be. The achievements of the Soviet Union's pest prediction and forecasting work today are inseparable from their long-term adherence to the prediction and forecasting system. We should establish the work of accumulating data in the early stage of widely carrying out prediction and forecasting work.
    The Soviet Union widely carried out prediction and forecasting work in 1930. Over the past twenty-five years, this work has played a significant role in formulating prevention and control plans and guiding prevention and control work. We must earnestly learn from the Soviet Union's advanced experience and do this work well.
    Basically eliminating the ten major diseases and pests of crops within seven years is a glorious task entrusted to us by the Party and the government, and it is also an urgent demand of the broad masses of peasants. We should do a good job in the prediction and forecasting of crop diseases and pests, and provide a strong guarantee for completing this task.

    加强农作物病虫害预测预报工作

    消灭病虫害同作战一样，必须组织战役。预测预报就是为组织战役搜集情报，预先测定病虫害的发生地区、发生时期和发展的趋势。这个工作是制定防治计划的重要依据，是正确地组织战役和有效地消灭病虫害的一个重要环节。
    我国农作物病虫害预测预报工作是解放以后才开始的。在治蝗方面，蝗区各省都相继开展了这个工作，每年侦查蝗情的面积约有1，000万亩。有些地区侦察蝗情做得较好，如江苏省的新海连市、灌云县云台区等地，能做到预测的基本精确。
    在防治小麦吸浆虫方面，河南、陕西等省已能预测小麦吸浆虫的羽化时期和为害程度，确定防治的范围和适当时期。1955年陕西省自上而下建立了预测预报制度，根据399个情报点的观察，预测吸浆虫的发生的面积和可能为害的程度，对正确地指导防治工作起了一定的作用。
    在防治黏虫方面，东北不少地区自1953年建立黏虫预报制度以来，每年防治黏虫的时期，提早了十天到半个月。由于防治时间的提早，可以改捕打幼虫为捕蛾、采卵，大大减轻了黏虫的为害。
    水稻螟虫的预测，江南稻区也已先后开始。浙江省已设有专职干部负责预测站的工作。这些站已有六年的系统观察，能部分地掌握稻螟的发生和发展情况。
    关于棉蚜、马铃薯晚疫病的预测预报工作，河北、山东、河南、内蒙古、山西等省也都取得了一定的成绩和经验。
    就大部地区说，预测预报工作还是一项新的工作。根据近几年部分地区的经验，进行这个工作，首先要组织群众性的病虫情报网。病虫害分布很广，种类很多，各地由于气候、土壤、栽培制度、防治基础等都不相同，病虫害的分布和发生消长情况也不相同；即使是同一地区，由于气候、天敌等各方面的变化，每年病虫发生消长的情况也不一样。如果不积极依靠群众，单凭几个预测预报站的少数人员，是不可能掌握全面情况的。农民群众直接参加农业生产，在他们从事田间操作的时候，可以经常观察到病虫害的活动，因此，只有依靠他们，才可以广泛地得到最切实的病虫情报。各地在进行预测预报工作当中，应该重视这支力量，依靠他们组成病虫情报网。广大的农民都有丰富的同病虫害作斗争的经验，他们熟悉当地的情况，对当地主要病虫害的发生发展情况常常能作准确的推断。这是他们经过多年实际考验而积累下来的宝贵经验。我们应该总结和提高这些经验，做为我们开展病虫预测预报工作的参考。
    其次，要有科学研究部门和气象部门的密切配合。预测预报工作是建立在科学基础上的，正确的预测预报应当掌握足够的资料，要了解病虫害的特征和发生规律。这些材料的取得主要是靠科学研究部门。气象变化是影响病虫发生消长的最主要原因之一，没有气象预报是作不出准确的病虫预报的；病虫发生的长期预报，也必须有气象上的长期预报才会可靠。
    第三，要加强对预测预报工作的领导。农业部门除了要在病虫害发生情况和栽培制度有代表性的地区设置长期的预测预报站，具体执行预测预报的观察记载办法，进行系统调查观察和作出预报外；还应该领导农业技术推广站、国营农场等生产单位做好病虫情报工作。
    第四，要注意积累资料的工作。预测预报是一项长期工作，要有多年资料的积累才行。正确的预报除了当年各个地区的观察记载外，还要有以往的资料对照。这个工作进行的时间越长，积累的资料越多，预测也就越有把握。苏联的病虫预测预报工作能有今天的成就，是同他们长期坚持预测预报制度分不开的。我们应该在广泛开展预测预报工作的初期，就建立起积累资料的工作。
    苏联在1930年就广泛开展了预测预报工作，二十五年来，这项工作在制定防治计划和指导防治工作上起了显著的作用。我们要认真学习苏联的先进经验，做好这个工作。
    七年内基本上消灭农作物十大病虫害，是党和政府交给我们的光荣任务，也是广大农民的迫切要求。我们应该做好农作物病虫害预测预报工作，为完成这个任务提供有力的保证。
