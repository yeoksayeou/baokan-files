Currently, judging from the situation in the Jinan Special District of Shanxi Province, the Party's propaganda work in rural areas still lags behind the needs of the cooperative transformation upsurge. This is mainly manifested in the following three aspects.

First, in terms of propaganda content, there has not been a systematic promotion of socialism, especially the socialist transformation of agriculture. In some places, Party propagandists in the propaganda of agricultural cooperation do not educate farmers according to some fundamental principles of socialism, but simply pander to the backward ideas of farmers on a case-by-case basis. For example, the propagandist in Aodi Village, Wenxi County, in order to mobilize farmers with more land and less labor to join the cooperative, mistakenly emphasized that more dividends could be distributed after joining the cooperative. When Feng Fuyun, the secretary of the Liancun Township branch in Daning County, mobilized farmers to join the cooperative, some farmers said, "I am afraid of losing freedom after joining the cooperative." He simply replied, "You can ask for leave." Some Party propagandists also dare not promote the issue of full socialist cooperation. For example, in the Quanlin, Yangxing, and Bailidian cooperatives in Linyi County, which are about to be transformed from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, members are clamoring to abolish land dividends, and they are voluntarily digging up boundary stones and breaking up land boundaries to welcome the arrival of tractors. However, our Party's propagandists and cadres still dare not openly promote the necessity of abolishing land remuneration and abolishing private ownership of major means of production, nor dare they openly promote the great superiority of the socialist distribution principle of distribution according to work. They are afraid that after publicizing it, "farmers in the cooperative will withdraw" and "farmers outside the cooperative will not join." This greatly hinders the improvement of the socialist consciousness of the peasant masses and the exertion of socialist enthusiasm.

Second, the organizational form and activity methods of the propaganda network also fail to keep up with the needs of the cooperative movement. In the past, most rural propaganda networks were based on villages, based on individual labor. Due to the development of the cooperative movement, this organizational form and activity method can no longer meet the needs of the new situation. For example, Qizhuang Village in Wanrong County has established three agricultural cooperatives, and most of the masses have joined the cooperatives. However, the Party's propaganda network has not changed its organizational form and adjusted its propaganda force in a timely manner based on the cooperative or the cooperative's production team, but still divides work and contracts according to lanes and areas, which is actually "contracting without doing," making the Party's propaganda work laissez-faire and scattered. Another example is the kuaiban [clapper talk] team in Taufan Village, Linyi County, which used to be one of the earliest and most active model kuaiban teams in the county, but now it is not active. This is because, after the great development of cooperation, some members of the kuaiban team have joined the cooperative, and some are still in the mutual aid team. In the evening, either the agricultural cooperative holds a meeting or the mutual aid team records work points. They often cannot get together. As a result, as the members said, "It is like an ox walking but a donkey not pulling, and the energy cannot be exerted together." The propaganda activities of the kuaiban team have also become scattered. This inability to adapt its organizational form and activity methods to the new situation is undoubtedly greatly damaging the role and effect of the propaganda network.

Finally, the development and growth of the propaganda team also lags behind the upsurge of cooperation. In the past year or so, the number of Party propagandists in rural areas has generally developed very slowly. The number of propagandists in a small number of townships and villages has even decreased. Some counties still have blank villages with no Party propagandists at all. There are more than 40 such blank villages in Xiangning County. As for the number of cooperatives, production teams, and production groups without propagandists, there are even more. However, the actual situation is that not only is there a need for development, but there is also a possibility for development, but due to the mischief of conservative thinking, there has been no development. For example, in Xi'an Township, Hongzhao County, 90% of farmers have joined the cooperative, but some production teams and production groups do not even have a propagandist. Is there no one who can be a propagandist? Of course not. There are 34 junior high school and senior elementary school graduates in this township, and most of them are willing to do propaganda work. Some have subscribed to the "Propagandist Handbook" and are preparing to carry out propaganda work among the masses, and some have taken the initiative to write blackboard newspapers. However, the branch has never developed them into Party propagandists, which has affected their enthusiasm. In Qizhuang Village, Wanrong County, there were originally 16 propagandists. Due to poor education and low awareness, 11 of them have not done propaganda work for a long time. However, the branch of this village neither educates and improves the existing propagandists nor develops new propagandists. It ignores the 14 activists who are qualified as propagandists, so that these activists are dissatisfied and say, "Propagandists do not do propaganda work, but those who do propaganda work cannot become propagandists."

In order to change the situation that the Party's rural propaganda work lags behind the needs of the situation, the Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China held a representative meeting of activists in rural propaganda work from December 16 to 21, 1955. The meeting focused on examining and criticizing the right-leaning conservative thinking existing in rural propaganda work. It was determined that the organizational form and activity methods of the Party's propaganda network and mass cultural propaganda organizations must be changed immediately, and their activities must be quickly transferred to agricultural cooperatives, and be reasonably distributed to the most basic units such as production teams and production groups. Secondly, it is necessary to quickly rectify, develop and expand the Party's propaganda team, improve the professional level of existing propagandists, and develop new propagandists. Propaganda groups should be established in agricultural cooperatives, and propagandists should be developed in production teams and production groups. Furthermore, each township branch should be equipped with a branch instructor who is semi-detached from production and each branch should be equipped with a Party class instructor as soon as possible. In agricultural cooperatives where branch offices have not been established, a Party member should be assigned as a deputy director specifically for political and ideological work. Finally, party organizations at all levels, especially county party committees, must strengthen specific leadership and overall planning for the Party's propaganda work in rural areas. It is necessary to make the Party's propaganda work in rural areas truly become a powerful assistant to the Party in carrying out a thorough socialist transformation of agriculture.

### 党在农村的宣传工作要赶上形势的需要

    党在农村的宣传工作要赶上形势的需要
    李兴华　景文灿　赵大勇
    目前，从山西晋南专区的情况来看，党在农村的宣传工作，仍然落后于合作化高潮的需要，这主要表现在以下三个方面。
    首先，在宣传内容上，还没有系统地宣传社会主义，特别是农业的社会主义改造问题。有些地方党的宣传员在农业合作化的宣传中，不是按照社会主义的一些根本原则去教育农民，而是就事论事地迁就农民的落后思想。例如闻喜县凹底村的宣传员，为了动员土地多劳力少的农户入社，竟错误地强调，入社后土地可以多分红。大宁县连村乡支部书记冯福云动员农民入社的时候，有的农民说：“入了社怕不自由”，他只简单的回答说：“可以请假”。也有些党的宣传员不敢宣传全社会主义合作化的问题。如临猗县的泉林、杨杏、百里店等合作社，即将由初级社转为高级社，社员们纷纷要求取消土地分红，并且自动挖掉界石，打破地界，迎接拖拉机的到来。可是，我们党的宣传员和干部还不敢公开宣传取消土地报酬和取消主要生产资料的私人所有制的必要性，也不敢公开宣传按劳取酬的社会主义分配原则的巨大优越性。他们害怕公开宣传以后，“社内农民要退社”“社外农民不入社”。这就大大妨碍着农民群众社会主义觉悟的提高和社会主义积极性的发挥。
    其次，宣传网的组织形式和活动方式，同样赶不上合作化运动的需要。过去多数乡村的宣传网都是以村为单位，以个体劳动为基础。由于合作化运动的发展，这种组织形式和活动方式已经远远不能适应新的形势的需要了。比如万荣县的七庄村，已经建立了三个农业合作社，大部分群众已经入社了。但是，党的宣传网并没有以合作社或者合作社的生产组为单位，及时地改变组织形式，调整宣传力量，还是照样按巷按片分工包干，实际上却是“包而不干”，使党的宣传工作自流涣散起来。再如临猗县太范村的快板队，过去是全县最早最活跃的模范快板队之一，现在却反而不活跃了。这就是因为，合作化大发展以后，快板队的队员有的入了合作社，有的还在互助组，晚间不是农业社开会，就是互助组记工，常常凑不到一块，结果，像队员们所说：“真是牛走驴不拉，劲儿使不到一疙瘩”。快板队的宣传活动也就涣散起来了。这种不善于使自己的组织形式和活动方式适应新的形势的情况，毫无疑问是在大大损害着宣传网的作用和效果的。
    最后，宣传队伍的发展和壮大，同样落在合作化的高潮后面。一年多以来，农村党的宣传员的数量普遍发展得非常缓慢，少数乡、村的宣传员还在减少，有些县还有根本没有党的宣传员的空白村，乡宁县这种空白村多到40多个。至于没有宣传员的合作社、生产队、生产组就更多了。而实际情况却是，不但有发展的需要，也有发展的可能，但由于保守思想的作怪，一直没有发展。例如洪赵县的西安乡已有90％的农户入社，可是有的生产队和生产组连一个宣传员也没有。是没有人能够作宣传员吗？当然不是。这个乡有初中和高小毕业生34人，他们大部分都愿意作宣传工作。有的订了“宣传员手册”，准备向群众进行宣传工作，有的主动去写黑板报。但支部却一直不发展他们为党的宣传员，以致影响了他们的积极性。万荣县的七庄村，原有16个宣传员，由于教育差，觉悟低，长期不作宣传工作的就有11个，而这个村的支部既不去教育和提高已有的宣传员，又不去发展新的宣传员。对具备了宣传员条件的14个宣传工作的积极分子却置之不理，使得这些积极分子不满地说：“宣传员不作宣传工作，作宣传工作的却当不上宣传员。”
    为了改变党的农村宣传工作落后于形势需要的状况，中共晋南地委曾于1955年12月16日至21日，召开了农村宣传工作积极分子代表大会，会上着重检查和批判了农村宣传工作中存在的右倾保守思想。确定，首先要立即改变党的宣传网组织和群众文艺宣传组织的组织形式和活动方式，把它们的活动迅速转到农业合作社里来，并且合理地分布到各个生产队和生产组等最基层的单位中去。其次，要迅速整顿、发展和壮大党的宣传队伍，提高已有的宣传员的业务水平，发展新的宣传员，要在农业合作社建立宣传组，在生产队和生产组发展宣传员。再其次，要尽快给每个乡支部配备一个半脱离生产的支部教员和给每个分支部配备党课辅导员。在没有建立分支部的农业合作社，要配备一个党员专作政治思想工作的副社长。最后，各级党组织，特别是县委必须加强对党在农村的宣传工作的具体领导和全面规划。要使党在农村的宣传工作确实成为党对农业实行彻底的社会主义改造的有力助手。
