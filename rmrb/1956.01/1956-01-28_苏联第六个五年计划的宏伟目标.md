    Agricultural Production
    The draft directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulate that by 1960, the annual grain output of the Soviet Union will increase to 11 billion poods (approximately 360.36 billion jin); the main agricultural products such as flax fiber, cotton, sugar beet, potatoes, and vegetables will increase by 35% to more than 100%. After the task of greatly increasing agricultural production in the Sixth Five-Year Plan is achieved, if averaged over a population of 200 million, each Soviet person will be able to receive 1,800 jin of grain per year by 1960.
    Reclaiming wasteland and expanding the sown area of crops are important measures to rapidly increase the production of agricultural products during the new Five-Year Plan period. This spring, the Soviet Union will sow grain and other crops on at least 30 million hectares of wasteland that has already been reclaimed in the past two years. This area is almost equal to the total sown area of wheat, barley, cotton, sugar beet, and potatoes in the United States in 1955.
    During the new Five-Year Plan period, heavy industry will supply agriculture with 1.6 million tractors, 560,000 grain harvesting combines, and many other agricultural machines.
    Petroleum Industry
    Orudzhev, Deputy Minister of the Soviet Petroleum Industry, told a TASS reporter that, according to the Soviet Union's already determined petroleum reserves, the Soviet petroleum industry can fully guarantee the task stipulated in the draft directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the Sixth Five-Year Plan, which is to produce 135 million tons of petroleum in 1960.
    The petroleum output in the Ural-Volga region and Central Asia is increasing the fastest. In the extraction of petroleum, the most effective working methods will be widely used. Four-fifths of the petroleum in the entire Soviet Union will be extracted using edge water flooding and edge gas flooding methods.
    Another important technical measure is to promote the method of hydraulic fracturing of petroleum layers, which can create artificially formed fractures in the oil layer to facilitate the flow of petroleum to the bottom of the well. Radiometric exploration methods will also be widely used. In addition, it is also necessary to promote the working method of remotely controlling the work of oil wells from the central control platform.
    Coal Mining Industry
    A spokesperson for the Soviet Coal Mining Industry Department told a TASS reporter that the task stipulated in the draft directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the Sixth Five-Year Plan, which is to reach a coal mining volume of 593 million tons by 1960, is entirely achievable.
    In 1956 alone, the Soviet Union will have 66 new mines and open-pit mines start coal mining, with a total annual output of 26,885,000 tons. The annual output of coal mining enterprises that will be put into production in five years will reach 240 million tons.
    He continued, that by 1960, it will also be possible to increase the coal mining volume of highly productive open-pit mines to 122 million tons. In Kuzbass, Central Asia, and the Moscow coal region, the amount of coal mined using hydraulic mining will be greatly increased.
    Medicine
    During the new Five-Year Plan period, Soviet medicine will continue to strive to solve three basic tasks: to extend the average lifespan of the people, to further reduce general mortality and infant mortality, and to continuously improve the health of the people. This was said by Professor Gerasimkov, Chairman of the Scientific Committee of the Soviet Ministry of Health, in a recent article.
    Gerasimkov said that Soviet scientists will first concentrate their efforts on overcoming tumors and various cardiovascular diseases, such as rheumatism, tonsillitis, and hypertension. Special attention will be paid to poliomyelitis, nervous infectious diseases, and childhood diseases such as measles and whooping cough.
    Great attention will be given to the further development of surgery, especially chest surgery, to the problems of hematology and blood transfusion, as well as to the adoption of new drugs and the research of new methods to resist lung diseases and other diseases.
    Much work will be done in applying radioactive materials to diagnose and treat various diseases.
    Gerasimkov concluded by writing: When planning our work during the new Five-Year Plan period, we should take into account the achievements of foreign countries.

    苏联第六个五年计划的宏伟目标
    农业生产
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案规定，到1960年，苏联谷物的年产量将要增加到110亿普特（约合3，603.6亿市斤）；亚麻纤维、棉花、甜菜、马铃薯和蔬菜等主要农产品将增加35％到1倍以上。第六个五年计划关于农业大增产的任务实现以后，如果按2亿人口平均，到1960年，每一个苏联人1年可以分到1，800市斤粮食。
    开垦荒地、扩大农作物播种面积，是新五年计划期间迅速增加农产品生产的重要措施之一。今年春季，苏联将要在过去两年已经开垦好的荒地上至少播种3，000万公顷谷物和其他农作物。这个面积几乎等于1955年美国的小麦、大麦、棉花、甜菜和马铃薯的播种面积的总和。
    在新的五年计划期间，重工业将供给农业160万台拖拉机、56万台谷物收获联合机和许多其他农业机器。石油工业
    苏联石油工业部副部长奥鲁杰夫向塔斯社记者说，根据苏联已经确定的石油储藏量，苏联石油工业完全可以保证达到苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划指示草案中规定的任务，在1960年生产13，500万吨石油。
    乌拉尔—伏尔加河地区和中亚细亚地区的石油产量增加得最快。在开采石油时，将广泛地使用最有效的工作方法。全苏联将有五分之四的石油用边水排油和边气排油法开采。
    另一项重要的技术措施就是推广水力破裂石油层的方法，用这种方法就可以在油层中造成人工形成的裂缝，便于石油流向油井井底。放射探矿的方法也将大量采用。此外，还要推广由中央操纵台对油井工作实行远距离操纵的工作方法。
    采煤工业
    苏联采煤工业部的发言人对塔斯社记者发表谈话说，苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案规定，到1960年，采煤量达到59，300万吨的任务，是完全可以达到的。
    仅在1956年一年中，苏联就将有66个新的矿井和露天矿场开始采煤，它们的年产量总计为26，885，000吨。在五年中将要投入生产的采煤企业的年产量将达到24，000万吨。
    他接着说，到1960年，还有可能把生产率很高的露天矿场的采煤量提高到12，200万吨。在库兹巴斯、中亚细亚、莫斯科煤区，用水力开采的煤的数量要大大增加。
    医学
    在新的五年计划期间，苏联的医学将继续努力解决3个基本任务：延长人民的平均寿命，进一步降低一般的死亡率和婴儿死亡率，不断改善人民的健康。这是苏联卫生部科学委员会主席革拉辛科夫教授最近在一篇文章中说的。
    革拉辛科夫说，苏联的科学家们首先将集中力量战胜肿瘤病和各种心脏血管疾病，例如风湿病、扁桃腺炎、高血压病等。对于脊髓灰白质炎、神经性感染病以及儿童的疾病，如麻疹、百日咳等将予以特别注意。
    对于外科、特别是胸部外科的进一步发展，对于血液学、输血法的问题，以及新药剂的采用和抵抗肺病和其他疾病的新方法的研究工作，将给予很大的注意。
    在应用放射性物质来诊断和治疗各种疾病方面将进行许多工作。
    革拉辛科夫最后写道：在计划我们在新五年计划期间的工作的时候，应该考虑到国外的成就。
