Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China convened the Supreme State Conference on the afternoon of the 25th to discuss the Draft National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967) proposed by the CPC Central Committee.

Chairman Mao Zedong spoke at the meeting. He said that our country is currently in the upsurge of the great socialist revolution. The founding of the People's Republic of China marks the transition of the Chinese revolution from the stage of bourgeois democratic revolution to the stage of socialist revolution, that is, entering the transitional period from capitalism to socialism. In the past six years, the main tasks of the first three years were to restore the national economy and carry out various social reforms that were not completed in the previous stage of the revolution, mainly land reform. Since last summer, socialist transformation, that is, the socialist revolution, has unfolded on an extremely broad scale and to an extremely profound degree. In about three more years, the socialist revolution can be basically completed nationwide.

Chairman Mao Zedong said that the purpose of the socialist revolution is to liberate the productive forces. The change of agriculture and handicrafts from individual ownership to socialist collective ownership, and the change of private industry and commerce from capitalist ownership to socialist ownership, will inevitably greatly liberate the productive forces. This creates the social conditions for greatly developing industrial and agricultural production.

Chairman Mao Zedong continued, "The method we use to carry out the socialist revolution is a peaceful one. In the past, many people, both inside and outside the Communist Party, expressed doubts about this method. However, since last summer, due to the upsurge of the cooperative movement in the countryside and the upsurge of socialist transformation in the cities in recent months, their doubts have been largely resolved. Under the conditions in our country, peaceful methods, that is, the method of persuasion and education, can not only change individual ownership into socialist collective ownership, but also change capitalist ownership into socialist ownership. The speed of socialist transformation in the past few months has greatly exceeded people's expectations. Some people used to worry that the socialist hurdle would be difficult to overcome, but now it seems that this hurdle is still easy to overcome."

Chairman Mao Zedong said that the current political situation in our country has undergone fundamental changes. Many difficult situations that existed in agriculture before last summer have now been basically changed, and many things that were once considered impossible can now be done. Our country's first five-year plan is likely to be completed ahead of schedule or overfulfilled. The task of the National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967) is to point out a prospect for the development of agricultural production and rural work on the basis of this upsurge of socialist transformation and socialist construction, as a goal for the struggle of farmers and agricultural workers across the country. All work outside of agriculture must also catch up quickly to adapt to the new situation of the socialist revolution upsurge.

Chairman Mao Zedong finally said: Our people should have a grand plan to strive to change our country's backwardness in economy, science, and culture within a few decades and quickly reach the advanced level in the world. In order to achieve this great goal, the decisive factor is to have cadres, to have a sufficient number of outstanding scientific and technological experts; at the same time, to continue to consolidate and expand the people's democratic united front, and unite all forces that can be united. Our people must also unite with the people of all countries in the world to strive to maintain world peace.

Those attending the meeting included Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council; Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, Li Weihan, and Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Chen Yun, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yi, Ulanhu, Li Fuchun, and Li Xiannian, Vice-Premiers of the State Council; Dong Biwu, President of the Supreme People's Court; Cheng Qian, Fu Zuoyi, and Long Yun, Vice-Chairmen of the National Defense Council; He Xiangning, Li Siguang, Zhang Bojun, Chen Jiageng, and Bao Erhan, Vice-Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Directors of the State Council's offices; Ministers of various ministries and relevant vice-ministers; Directors of various committees, relevant vice-directors, and heads of directly affiliated units; Vice-Presidents of the Supreme People's Court; Deputy Procurators-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate; Standing Committee members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Vice-Presidents of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, directors of departments, directors of research institutes, and directors of research offices; heads of universities and colleges in Beijing and from various regions, representatives of primary and secondary schools, famous scientists, professors, experts, and people from all walks of life in industry and commerce, literature and art, journalism, and religion, totaling more than 300 people.

After Chairman Mao Zedong's speech, Liao Luyan, Deputy Director of the Rural Work Department of the CPC Central Committee, explained the Draft National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967).

At the meeting, Premier Zhou Enlai made an important speech on issues such as the plan for cultivating senior intellectuals, Vice-Premier Chen Yun made an important speech on the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and agricultural production, and Vice-Premier Li Fuchun made an important speech on the completion of the first five-year plan and the prospect of future plans.

Subsequently, representatives from the scientific, educational, industrial, and commercial sectors, and various democratic parties spoke one after another, unanimously and warmly supporting the Draft National Agricultural Development Program. Everyone pointed out in their speeches that the proposal of this program is very necessary and timely, and the various tasks stipulated in it are completely in line with reality and can be completed. Experts related to the various work tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program also put forward many specific suggestions in their speeches. Everyone pointed out in their speeches that the realization of this program will make our country's agriculture an advanced agriculture, will fundamentally change the face of our vast rural areas, will greatly improve the material and cultural lives of 500 million farmers, and will provide sufficient food and raw materials and a broad domestic market for the development of our country's industry. Everyone also believes that the promulgation of this program will undoubtedly greatly encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of farmers across the country, further promote the upsurge of agricultural production and rural construction, and greatly encourage the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life in socialist construction and socialist transformation. Everyone also expressed that they must contribute their strength to the realization of this great agricultural development program.

Today's Supreme State Conference was held from 3:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Before today's meeting, the CPC Central Committee had convened the heads of the CPC's provincial committees, municipal committees, autonomous region committees, and relevant departments to discuss the Draft National Agricultural Development Program (1956-1967). In the past few days, the CPC Central Committee invited 1,375 scientists, leaders of democratic parties, leaders of people's organizations, and people from the cultural and educational circles in Beijing in the fields of industry, agriculture, medicine and health, and social sciences to conduct discussions in groups. The Draft National Agricultural Development Program submitted to today's Supreme State Conference for discussion has been revised based on the opinions put forward in the previous discussions.

    毛泽东主席召集最高国务会议
    讨论中共中央提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案
    新华社25日讯　中华人民共和国毛泽东主席于25日下午召集了最高国务会议，讨论中共中央提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案。
    毛泽东主席在会上讲话。他说，目前我国正处在伟大的社会主义革命的高潮中。中华人民共和国的成立标志着中国革命由资产阶级民主革命阶段转变到社会主义革命阶段，即进入由资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期。在过去的六年中，前三年的工作主要是恢复国民经济和进行前一革命阶段中没有完成的各项社会改革，主要是土地改革。从去年夏季以来，社会主义改造，也就是社会主义革命就以极广阔的规模和极深刻的程度展开起来。大约再有三年的时间，社会主义革命就可以在全国范围内基本上完成。
    毛泽东主席说，社会主义革命的目的是为了解放生产力。农业和手工业由个体所有制变为社会主义的集体所有制，私营工商业由资本主义所有制变为社会主义所有制，必然使生产力大大地获得解放。这样就为大大地发展工业和农业的生产创造了社会条件。
    毛泽东主席接着说，我们进行社会主义革命所用的方法是和平的方法。对于这种方法，过去在共产党内和共产党外，都有许多人表示怀疑。但是从去年夏季以来，由于农村中合作化运动的高潮和最近几个月以来城市中社会主义改造的高潮，他们的疑问已经大体解决了。在我国的条件下，用和平的方法，即用说服教育的方法，不但可以改变个体的所有制为社会主义的集体所有制，而且可以改变资本主义所有制为社会主义所有制。过去几个月来社会主义改造的速度大大超过了人们的意料。过去有些人怕社会主义这一关难过，现在看来，这一关也还是容易过的。
    毛泽东主席说，目前我们国家的政治形势已经起了根本的变化。去年夏季以前在农业方面存在的许多困难情况现在已经基本上改变了，许多曾经被认为办不到的事情现在也可以办了。我国的第一个五年计划有可能提前完成或者超额完成。1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要的任务，就是在这个社会主义改造和社会主义建设的高潮的基础上，给农业生产和农村工作的发展指出一个远景，作为全国农民和农业工作者的奋斗目标。农业以外的各项工作，也都必须迅速赶上，以适应社会主义革命高潮的新形势。
    毛泽东主席最后说：我国人民应该有一个远大的规划，要在几十年内，努力改变我国在经济上和科学文化上的落后状况，迅速达到世界上的先进水平。为了实现这个伟大的目标，决定一切的是要有干部，要有数量足够的、优秀的科学技术专家；同时，要继续巩固和扩大人民民主统一战线，团结一切可能团结的力量。我国人民还要同世界各国人民团结一起，为维护世界的和平而奋斗。
    出席会议的有全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长刘少奇，国务院总理周恩来，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、沈钧儒、郭沫若、黄炎培、彭真、李维汉、陈叔通，国务院副总理陈云、邓小平、陈毅、乌兰夫、李富春、李先念，最高人民法院院长董必武，国防委员会副主席程潜、傅作义、龙云，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席何香凝、李四光、章伯钧、陈嘉庚、鲍尔汉，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员，国务院各办公室主任，各部部长和有关各部副部长，各委员会主任、有关的副主任和直属单位的负责人，最高人民法院副院长，最高人民检察院副检察长，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员，中国科学院副院长、学部主任、研究所所长和研究室主任，北京的和来自各地的各高等院校的负责人、中小学校的代表、著名的科学家、教授、专家和工商界、文艺界、新闻界、宗教界等各界人士共三百多人。
    在毛泽东主席讲话以后中共中央农村工作部副部长廖鲁言就1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案作了说明。
    会上，周恩来总理就培养高级知识分子的规划等问题，陈云副总理就私营工商业的社会主义改造和农业生产的问题，李富春副总理就第一个五年计划的完成情况和今后的规划远景的问题，作了重要发言。
    接着，科学界、教育界、工商界和各民主党派的代表人物先后发言，一致热烈拥护这个全国农业发展纲要草案。大家在发言中指出：这个纲要的提出是十分必要和适时的，其中所规定的各项任务是完全切合实际的，是可以完成的。和全国农业发展纲要中所规定的各项工作任务有关的专家们在发言中还提出了许多具体的建议。大家在发言中指出：这个纲要的实现，将使我国的农业成为先进的农业，将使我国广大的农村根本改变面貌，将使五亿农民的物质生活和文化生活大大提高，将为我国工业的发展提供充分的粮食和原料以及广阔的国内市场。大家还认为这个纲要的公布无疑将大大鼓舞全国农民的积极性和创造性，进一步推动农业生产和农村建设的高潮，并且大大鼓舞其他各界人民的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的积极性。大家并且表示一定要为这个伟大的农业发展纲要的实现而贡献出自己的力量。
    今天的最高国务会议在下午3时到9时举行。在今天的会议之前，中共中央曾召集中国共产党的各省委、市委、自治区党委和有关部门的负责人，就1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案进行了讨论。在最近几天，中共中央邀请了在北京的工业、农业、医药卫生、社会科学等各方面的科学家、各民主党派、各人民团体的负责人和文化界、教育界的人士，共1，375人，分组进行了讨论。提交今天的最高国务会议讨论的全国农业发展纲要草案是根据在这以前的多次讨论中所提出的意见作了修正的。（附图片）
