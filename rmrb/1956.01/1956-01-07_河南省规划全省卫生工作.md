Henan Province Plans Province-Wide Health Work
    The Henan Provincial Health Department recently made preliminary plans for the province's health work.

    The plan specifies that before 1958, all county health centers in the province will be converted to people's hospitals in batches, and a health and epidemic prevention station and a maternal and child health center will be established in each county. In addition, a large number of joint clinics will be organized. Before 1957, an average of two to three joint clinics are required in each central township, and more than half of the Chinese and Western medical personnel in the province will be organized to work in joint clinics. At the same time, it is planned to establish health rooms in some agricultural production cooperatives.

    The plan also calls for attention to the prevention and elimination of several major diseases that seriously endanger production and people's health. It is required to eliminate smallpox before 1957; to basically eliminate venereal diseases and goiter in young adults and children by 1959; to basically eliminate kala-azar by 1962, and at the same time vigorously control epidemic encephalitis B, influenza, measles, diphtheria and other diseases.

    The plan also stipulates that a patriotic health campaign should be launched to eliminate the "four pests." It is required that rats be basically eliminated in cities by 1958; house rats be basically eliminated in rural areas by 1959, and field rats be eliminated by 1961. Flies should be basically eliminated in cities by 1959 and in rural areas by 1960. Mosquitoes should be eliminated in cities by 1960 and in rural areas by 1962, and efforts should be made to eliminate sparrows as soon as possible in cooperation with relevant departments.

    The plan also requires the province to train more than 200,000 health workers who do not leave production, more than 50,000 nursery workers who do not leave production, and more than 22,000 midwives for agricultural production cooperatives before 1957.
