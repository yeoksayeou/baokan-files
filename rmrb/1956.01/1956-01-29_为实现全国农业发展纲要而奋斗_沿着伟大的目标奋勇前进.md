To the Editors:

    The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft), proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, allows us to see a concrete vision of a happy and beautiful countryside. We deeply thank the Party and Chairman Mao for their thorough consideration for us farmers: not only have they pointed out specific goals for collectivization and increased production, but they have also proposed measures to eliminate illiteracy, popularize rural broadcasting networks, and install telephones, among other things, to change the backward conditions in the countryside. We resolutely support this program, and we will strive to realize it with practical actions.

    Since our cooperative was established in February 1953, production has increased year by year, and the lives of our members have continuously improved. This has attracted many individual farmers to actively apply for membership. Especially after the publication of Chairman Mao's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperation, our cooperative not only absorbed many individual farmers from the surrounding areas, but also accepted the merger of 13 primary cooperatives such as Xinzhuang, Dahuichang, and Taiziyu. Now, our cooperative has become a large cooperative encompassing over 2,000 households in 4 townships and 4 natural villages.

    We know that we are a completely socialist cooperative and should play a leading and exemplary role in realizing the National Agricultural Development Program. We are accelerating the formulation of a comprehensive seven-year plan. At present, the members are actively participating in water conservancy construction, manure accumulation, and sideline production. Two main canals, each approximately 18 li long, have already been dug. After this water conservancy project is completed in April of this year, it can turn more than 7,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields; and the large-scale accumulation of fertilizer also ensures the realization of this year's "thousand jin per mu" plan. We must continue to work hard and advance courageously towards the great goals pointed out to us by the National Agricultural Development Program.

    为实现全国农业发展纲要而奋斗
    沿着伟大的目标奋勇前进编辑同志：
    中共中央政治局提出的全国农业发展纲要（草案），使我们具体地看到了农村幸福、美丽的远景。我们深深地感谢党和毛主席，他们给我们农民想得真周到：不仅给我们指出了合作化和增产的具体目标，而且还提出了扫除文盲、普及农村广播网、设置电话等各种改变农村落后状况的措施。我们坚决拥护这个纲要，我们要以实际行动来努力实现它。
    我们合作社从1953年2月建立以来，生产年年提高，社员生活也不断改善。这就吸引了很多个体农民积极申请入社。特别是毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的指示公布后，我们社不光吸收了周围的许多个体农民入社，还接受了辛庄、大灰厂、太子峪等13个初级社并入到我们社里来。现在，我们社已经成为一个包括4个乡、4个自然村的2，000户以上的大社了。
    我们知道，我们是完全社会主义的合作社，应该在实现全国农业发展纲要中起带头作用和示范作用。我们正在加速制定7年的全面规划。在目前，社员们都积极参加兴修水利、积肥和进行副业生产。现在已挖好两条约18华里长的干渠，这个水利工程在今年4月完成以后，可使7，000多亩旱田变成水田；而大量增积肥料，也使得今年“千亩千斤”的计划的实现有了保证。我们还要继续努力，根据全国农业发展纲要给我们指出的远大目标奋勇前进。		北京市张郭庄农业生产合作社主任　郭荣				        副主任　韩文玉
