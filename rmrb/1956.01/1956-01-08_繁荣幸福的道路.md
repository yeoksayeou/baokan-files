　　“The Road to Prosperity and Happiness”
　　To the Editor:
　　The Jining-Ulaanbaatar railway has been completed. This is another great achievement in the construction of our motherland, and it is also a great joyous event for the people of Inner Mongolia. Our Mongolian people excitedly call this railway "Khukhe Gilii Zamaa" – meaning: "The Road to Prosperity and Happiness."
　　Since the construction of the railway from Jining to Erenhot, it has brought great benefits to the people of Inner Mongolia. Take the situation in our Right Wing Rear Banner of Chahar as an example: In the past, transportation in our area was very inconvenient. It took ten days to travel back and forth from Tumertai to Jining by ox cart. Now, it only takes seven hours to get to Jining from Tumertai by train. The means of production and daily necessities needed by farmers and herdsmen, such as saddles, agricultural tools, printed cloth, brick tea, rice, and liquor, can be transported in a timely manner, and the prices are also greatly reduced compared to the past. For example, the price of a pack of matches has dropped from 1 jiao 5 fen to 1 jiao 3 fen. From matches alone, the entire banner received a profit of 2,744 yuan in 1954 alone. Grains, oils, medicinal materials, furs, and other local products in our area can also be transported out in large quantities. Even sheep manure bricks, which no one wanted in the past, can be transported to various places to support agricultural production. In 1955, our banner sold 20.2 million catties of sheep manure bricks to Shandong, Shanxi, and other places, worth 20,200 yuan. With the development of transportation and the improvement of agricultural and animal husbandry production, the purchasing power of the people in our banner is now twice as high as before the construction of this railway.
　　The benefits that the Jining-Ulaanbaatar railway brings to the people of Inner Mongolia are endless. We must, together with the people of all fraternal nationalities, follow Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation, vigorously develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement in agriculture and animal husbandry, and support national industrial construction.

　　“繁荣幸福的道路”
　　编辑同志：
    集宁—乌兰巴托铁路已经建成了，这是祖国建设中的又一个巨大的成就，也是我们内蒙古人民的一件大喜事。我们蒙古族人民都兴奋地把这条铁路叫做“呼克吉利札玛”——意思就是：“繁荣幸福的道路”。
    自从集宁到二连的铁路修建以来，已经给内蒙古人民带来了很大的好处。拿我们察哈尔右翼后旗的情况来说吧：过去我们这个地区的交通很不方便，从土牧尔台到集宁用牛车往返一次需要十天的时间。现在，从土牧尔台坐上火车只要七个小时就可以到集宁。农民、牧民所需要的生产资料和生活资料，如马鞍、农具、花布、砖茶、大米、酒类等，都能及时地运来，而且价格也比过去大大降低了。例如，一包火柴的售价就从1角5分降低到1角3分，光火柴一项，全旗1954年一年就得到了2，744元的利益。我们这个地区的粮食、油料、药材、皮毛和其他土产也能够大量外运，甚至连过去没有人要的羊粪砖也能够运往各地支援农业生产。1955年我旗出卖给山东、山西等地的羊粪砖就有2，020万斤，价值人民币20，200元。随着交通的发展和农牧业生产的提高，现在我旗人民的购买力比修建这条铁路以前提高了一倍。
    集宁—乌兰巴托铁路带给内蒙古人民的好处是说不完的。我们一定要和各兄弟民族的人民一道，遵照毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示，大力发展农牧业互助合作运动，支援国家工业建设。
