　　Preliminary Experience in Trial-Running Advanced Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
　　中共黑龙江省委员会
　　Heilongjiang Province saw the emergence of its first fully socialist agricultural producers' cooperative (i.e., the Spark Collective Farm) in 1951. By 1955, the number had grown to 29, encompassing a total of 3,474 farming households. Among these, the five advanced cooperatives established before 1953 were formed under special circumstances. The 24 advanced cooperatives established after 1954 transitioned gradually from semi-socialist agricultural producers' cooperatives. They generally experienced a history of two years as elementary cooperatives before transitioning to advanced ones.

　　In the process of focusing on the trial operation of these advanced cooperatives, the preliminary experience gained is:

　　I. Transitioning to advanced cooperatives is an inevitable trend in the development of elementary cooperatives. Once elementary cooperatives develop to a certain extent, they must be transformed into advanced cooperatives in a timely manner; otherwise, production stagnation and organizational disarray will occur. At the same time, certain conditions must be met to transition to advanced cooperatives. The "New Life" and "Peace" advanced cooperatives, established in 1952 on the basis of mutual aid teams, had weak economic foundations and low member awareness. Relying on state loans and dispatched cadres, their production was poor for two consecutive years until it finally improved thoroughly in 1955. The 24 advanced cooperatives built on the basis of elementary cooperatives not only avoided the potential losses that could arise during the establishment of advanced cooperatives but also maintained rising production after becoming advanced cooperatives. The conditions that need to be met for transitioning from elementary to advanced cooperatives are: (1) Production has developed considerably, and further development requires changing the private ownership of major means of production such as land and draft animals; (2) Members' awareness has been significantly raised, and the transition to advanced cooperatives has become an urgent demand of the members; (3) There is a certain amount of public accumulation; (4) There are a certain number of leading cadres and initial experience in managing the collective economy.

　　According to the pattern of these 24 elementary cooperatives transitioning to advanced cooperatives, in general, as long as leadership is strengthened, elementary cooperatives can meet the conditions for transitioning to advanced cooperatives after two or three years. The reasons are: (1) After transitioning from individual economy to elementary cooperatives, the rate of productivity improvement greatly exceeds that of the small-scale peasant economy. Therefore, the private ownership of major means of production such as land and draft animals quickly becomes incompatible with the rapidly developing productivity. (2) In the cooperative movement, not only have the socialist consciousness of poor and lower-middle peasants been rapidly raised, but also the relatively well-off middle peasants have gained a certain understanding of cooperatives and their consciousness has also been raised. (3) Within a village or hamlet, not all cooperatives must fully meet the above conditions to transition to advanced cooperatives. As long as one or two central cooperatives have matured conditions, other cooperatives with slightly less favorable conditions can also be driven forward.

　　II. Correctly stipulating the method for changing members' privately owned major means of production into collective ownership and earnestly implementing the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit are the central links in ensuring the smooth transition of elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives.

　　The first is the issue of land disposal. Advanced cooperatives transitioning on the basis of elementary cooperatives generally go through a process of relatively reducing land rent to finally eliminating land remuneration. When production has significantly developed and members' income has significantly increased, it is not only reasonable to adopt the method of transferring land to the collective use of the entire cooperative without compensation, but also it is the demand of the peasants. Facts have proven that eliminating land remuneration can better improve production, which is not only beneficial to poor and lower-middle peasants with less land but also beneficial to relatively well-off middle peasants with more land. Therefore, poor and lower-middle peasants actively support this method of handling, and upper-middle peasants are also willing to accept it. Members say: The land rent for one hectare of land is not worth a few labor days' worth of money, and it is much better to distribute a little more per labor day than to receive land rent.

　　The second is the issue of handling draft animals and farm implements. It is not appropriate to use the method of purchasing everything with public accumulation funds. Some cooperatives initially tried this method, but the result was that the cooperative was in debt every year and could not expand production. On the other hand, large amounts of funds flowed into the hands of members, causing accumulation, waste, and even lending. According to existing experience, a relatively appropriate method is: assess the price for purchase, take into account the affordability of most members based on the amount of the price, and have most or part of it be equally shared by the members as public ownership share funds, with the insufficient part gradually paid off from the public accumulation funds. The advantage of this method is that not only are the middle peasants satisfied, but the poor peasants are also justified, which is conducive to consolidating the unity of the poor and middle peasants and conducive to the development of production. The prices of draft animals and farm implements are generally assessed according to the local perennial market prices, and a repayment period of three years is generally better. If the period is too long, the middle peasants will be dissatisfied; if the period is too short, it will affect the cooperative's expansion of production. It is appropriate to apportion public ownership share funds based on labor power and unreasonable to apportion them based on land. The amount of public ownership share funds should not only meet the needs of public ownership of the means of production as much as possible but also take into account that most members can afford to pay. It has proven to be feasible to reduce or exempt individual elderly, weak, disabled farmers from paying public ownership share funds.

　　The third is the issue of handling the original public property and share funds of each cooperative when elementary cooperatives merge and transition to advanced cooperatives. In Heilongjiang Province, the transition from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives is generally not a single cooperative, but several cooperatives merging and transitioning at the same time, and sometimes also absorbing some mutual aid teams or individual households. This creates the problem of unequal amounts of original public property and share funds between cooperatives. If handled improperly, it will cause disunity among the members. Public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, state rewards, and property increased by members' collective labor accumulated by each original cooperative should all be transferred to the public ownership of the advanced cooperative, regardless of the amount. Do not divide up the larger amounts, and do not require the smaller amounts to be made up. The production fee share funds originally apportioned by the members should all be transferred to the production fee share funds of the advanced cooperative. Overpayments should not be refunded, and underpayments should not be made up. If the means of production originally purchased by members with pooled funds are handled in the same way as public accumulation funds, members who originally apportioned more will not easily accept it. The standard should be based on those who apportioned more, and those who paid less should make up the difference to the cooperative. The investments that members originally made in the elementary cooperative should not be excluded when transitioning to the advanced cooperative. They can be transferred to investments in the advanced cooperative according to the members' wishes and repaid by the advanced cooperative. Members' investments should be a supplementary source of funds for the advanced cooperative.

　　III. Continuously improving agricultural technology and increasing new production content are the determining factors for the consolidation and continuous development of advanced cooperatives. The advanced cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province have all formulated long-term production and construction plans for three to five years, tapped production potential, enriched the content of production and construction, and powerfully promoted the development of production.

　　In order to ensure the development of advanced cooperative production, the management level of the cooperative must be correspondingly improved. Based on the characteristics of advanced cooperatives with large operating scopes, diverse production content, and strong technicality, management work should emphasize doing the following well: (1) Planned management. As one cooperative director said, "An advanced cooperative with one or two hundred households is catching up with a small farm, and it is impossible to move an inch without a plan." Not only should there be a plan for the entire cooperative, but each production team should also have a corresponding plan. (2) Establishing a rational labor organization and responsibility system. The production team must become the basic form for organizing production in advanced cooperatives. The production team should have fixed members, use certain draft animals and farm implements, and be responsible for a certain cultivated area. Various productions within the cooperative, such as animal husbandry, aquaculture, and horticulture, should be the long-term responsibility of specialized production groups, production teams, or individuals, according to the development situation, in order to accumulate experience and continuously improve technology. (3) Advanced cooperatives implement a distribution system that is completely based on labor, requiring more scientific and rational calculation of labor. To meet this requirement, work quotas must be formulated, a piece-rate system must be implemented, and permanent contracting for work and output must be gradually implemented to overcome egalitarianism in calculating labor. Experience has proven that formulating production quotas is the central link in planned production and rational organization of labor, calculation of labor, and implementation of the responsibility system. (4) Strengthening technical management. Lack of technical knowledge and technical personnel is a common difficulty encountered by advanced cooperatives. Phenomena such as production reduction or death of draft animals due to lack of technical knowledge have occurred in various cooperatives. Agricultural machinery stations and agricultural technology extension stations in various localities have played a decisive role in helping advanced cooperatives overcome these difficulties and promote production development. However, this aspect still cannot meet the needs of cooperative production development. Strengthening the production links between advanced cooperatives and agricultural machinery stations and technology extension stations, and cultivating technical personnel in a planned manner, is an important task to ensure the continuous development of advanced cooperative production.

　　IV. Correctly distributing income. The income distribution of advanced cooperatives is different from that of elementary cooperatives. It does not have a production means distribution portion and must be distributed entirely according to the socialist distribution principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." At the same time, it should first fulfill the obligations that should be paid to the state (including agricultural tax, mechanical cultivation fees, repayment of maturing loans, etc.); then reserve all the funds within the advanced cooperative (including public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, next year's production costs, etc.); and distribute the remaining physical and cash income according to labor days. This will closely combine the interests of the state, the interests of the cooperative, and the interests of the members. In the early period, some cooperatives, due to an unclear understanding of this socialist distribution principle, emphasized that members should receive more dividends, leading to a distribution method of "members first, cooperative second, and state last." Some cooperatives, in order to show "superiority," were unwilling to repay state loans, did not reserve public accumulation funds, and did not leave next year's production costs. Later, this erroneous practice was reversed, and the socialist distribution principle was implemented. In 1955, the income distribution work of various advanced cooperatives universally reflected "satisfaction on all three sides." Expanding production in advanced cooperatives mainly relies on internal accumulation of the cooperative, and developing the public economy of the cooperative is the main source of increasing the welfare of the members. Therefore, sufficient production costs for the next year and a certain amount of public accumulation funds and public welfare funds must be reserved during income distribution. In the early stage of transitioning to advanced cooperatives, it is generally appropriate to reserve about 10% of the net income for public accumulation funds and about 2% of the net income for public welfare funds, and then increase them appropriately with the development of production.

　　V. The process of establishing and developing advanced cooperatives is a process of struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. In the process of transitioning from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries have engaged in sabotage activities such as spreading rumors, sowing discord, and poisoning livestock. In order to guarantee the victory of socialism, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party and the political and ideological education work of the members. The first is to implement the Party's class line in the countryside. Due to the different circumstances of occupying the means of production, the economic conditions of the members of the elementary cooperative are still unbalanced, so their attitudes towards transitioning to advanced cooperatives are also different. In the transition from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, in addition to embodying the class policy in the handling of the means of production, it is also necessary to guarantee the superiority of the poor peasants in the organization of members and leading members.

　　Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education work of the Party for the members. Advanced cooperatives are more qualified to establish a regular political and ideological work system, and the content of education is also richer. The advantages of the cooperative should be combined to carry out patriotic and collectivist ideological education for the members, constantly eliminate the influence of capitalist ideology and overcome the backward and conservative habits of small producers; it should also regularly educate members to prevent and overcome the arrogant and complacent mood of thinking that advanced cooperatives are "one head taller" than others, educate members to unite and help elementary cooperatives and farmers outside the cooperatives to progress, and mobilize members to launch socialist labor competitions to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of production plans.

　　Finally, in running advanced cooperatives, it is necessary to rely on the Party branch and strengthen the combat fortress role of the branch in the advanced cooperative. Because advanced cooperatives are relatively large in scale and have more Party members and League members, Party and League branches should be established on a cooperative basis, and Party and League groups should be established on a production team basis, so that Party and League organizations are close to all production activities of the cooperative, closely linked with the masses, and ensure the implementation of the Party's policies and resolutions.

　　试办高级农业生产合作社的初步经验
    中共黑龙江省委员会
    黑龙江省在1951年开始出现了第一个完全社会主义的农业生产合作社（即星火集体农庄），1955年发展到29个，入社农户共3，474户。其中1953年以前建立起来的五个高级社都是在特殊条件下建立的。1954年以后建立的24个高级社，都是在半社会主义农业生产合作社基础上逐步过渡的。他们在转为高级社以前一般都经过了二年初级社的历史。
    在重点试办这些高级社的过程中，初步取得的经验是：
    一、向高级社过渡是初级社发展的必然趋势，初级社发展到一定程度，必须及时转变为高级社，否则就会发生生产停滞，组织涣散的现象。同时转变为高级社，也必须具备一定的条件。1952年在互助组基础上建立起来的“新生”和“和平”两个高级社，由于经济基础薄弱，社员觉悟不高，依靠国家贷款、派干部，头二年连年生产搞得不好，直到1955年生产才彻底好转。而在初级社基础上建成的24个高级社，不但避免了在成立高级社的时候可能引起的种种损失，而且在建成高级社以后，生产一直是上升的。由初级社过渡到高级社，需要具备的条件是：（1）生产有了相当发展，要进一步发展生产，就需要改变土地、耕畜等主要生产资料的私有制；（2）社员觉悟有了相当的提高，过渡到高级社已经成为社员的迫切要求；（3）有一定数量的公共积累；（4）有一定数量的领导骨干和初步积累了管理集体经济的经验。
    根据这24个初级社过渡到高级社的规律看来，一般初级社只要加强领导，经过两三年的时间就可以具备向高级社过渡的条件，原因是：（1）由个体经济转到初级社后，生产力提高的速度大大超过小农经济，因此，很快就暴露出土地、耕畜等主要生产资料的私有制和迅速发展起来的生产力不相适应。（2）在合作化运动中，不但贫农和下中农社会主义觉悟提高得很快，就是富裕中农因为对合作社有了一定的认识，觉悟也提高了。（3）一村、一屯之内，向高级社过渡并不是所有合作社都必须完全具备上述条件，只要有一两个中心社条件成熟，其他社条件稍差一些，也可以带动起来。
    二、正确地规定社员私有主要生产资料改变为集体所有制的办法，切实执行自愿互利的原则，是保证初级社顺利过渡到高级社的中心环节。
    首先是土地处理问题。在初级社基础上过渡的高级社一般是经过相对地降低地租到最后取消土地报酬。在生产有了显著发展，社员收入有了显著增加的情况下，土地采取无代价地归全社集体使用不仅是合理的，也是农民的要求。事实证明取消土地报酬以后，更能提高生产，不但对土地较少的贫农和下中农有利，对土地较多的富裕中农也有利。因此，贫农和下中农积极拥护这种处理办法，上中农也愿意接受。社员们说：一垧地的地租不值几个劳动日的钱，每个劳动日多分点比土地吃租强得多。
    其次是耕畜、农具处理问题。全部用公积金收买的方法是不够妥当的，有的合作社开始曾经试用过这种方法，结果一方面使合作社年年背债，不能扩大生产；另一方面大批资金流入社员手中，造成积压、浪费，甚至放债。根据已有经验，比较妥善的办法是：作价收买，根据价款数目，照顾大多数社员的负担能力，大部分或者一部分由社员平摊公有化股份基金，不足部分用公积金逐步偿付。这种办法的好处是不但中农满意，贫农也理直气壮，有利于巩固贫农和中农的团结，有利于发展生产。耕畜、农具的价格一般照当地常年市价评定，偿还期限一般以三年比较好，期限过长中农不满，期限太短会影响合作社扩大生产。公有化股份基金按劳动力摊纳是合适的，按土地摊纳是不合理的。公有化股份基金的数量，既要尽量满足生产资料公有化的需要，又要照顾多数社员能纳得起。对个别老弱残疾农民，少纳或免纳公有化股份基金，事实证明是可以行得通的。
    再次是关于初级社合并转向高级社的时候，各社中原有公共财产和股份基金的处理问题。在黑龙江省初级社向高级社过渡一般不是一个社，而是几个社同时合并，同时过渡，有时还吸收一部分互助组或单干户。这就产生了各社之间原有公共财产和股份基金数量不等的问题，如处理不当，就会造成社员之间的不团结。原有各社积累的公积金、公益金、国家奖励和社员集体劳动增加的财产，应当不论多少一律转归高级社公有，多的不要分掉，少的不必补纳。社员原来摊纳的生产费股份基金，应当一律转为高级社的生产费股份基金。多纳的不应当退还，少纳的也不必补交。社员原来集资购买的生产资料，如果和公积金一样处理，原来多摊的社员不容易接受，应当以多摊的为标准，少纳的向社内补齐。社员原来向初级社的投资，转为高级社的时候也不应当排除，可以根据社员的自愿转为向高级社的投资，由高级社偿还。社员投资应是高级社资金的一项补助来源。
    三、不断提高农业技术，增加新的生产内容，是高级社巩固和不断发展的决定因素。黑龙江省各高级社都制定了三、五年的长远生产建设规划，挖掘了生产潜力，充实了生产建设内容，有力地推动了生产的发展。
    为了保证高级社生产的发展，必须相应地提高社的管理水平。根据高级社经营范围大，生产内容多，技术性较强的特点，管理工作应当强调做好：（1）计划管理。像有的社主任说：“一个高级社一二百户赶上个小农场了，没有计划寸步难行。”不但要有全社计划，而且各个生产队也要有相应的计划。（2）建立合理的劳动组织和责任制。生产队必须成为高级社组织生产的基本形式。生产队应当有固定的成员，使用一定的耕畜和农具，负责一定的耕作区。社内各种生产如牧畜、水产、园艺等，应当根据发展情况，由专门生产组、生产队或专人长期负责，以便积累经验，不断提高技术。（3）高级社实行完全按劳取酬的分配制度，要求计算劳动更加科学更加合理。为适应这个要求，必须制定工作定额，推行按件计酬制，并且逐步实行常年包工包产，克服计算劳动上的平均主义。经验证明，制定生产定额是有计划生产和合理组织劳动、计算劳动、贯彻执行责任制的中心环节。（4）加强技术管理。不懂技术、缺乏技术人材是各高级社普遍碰到的困难，由于不懂技术而造成减产或耕畜死亡等现象各社都发生过。各地的农业机器站和农业技术推广站在帮助高级社克服这些困难，推动生产发展上，起了决定性的作用。但是目前这方面仍然满足不了合作社生产发展的需要，加强高级社同农业机器站、技术推广站的生产联系，有计划地培养技术人材，是保证高级社生产不断向前发展的重要工作。
    四、正确分配收益。高级社的收益分配和初级社不同，它没有生产资料分配部分，必须完全按照“各尽所能，按劳取酬”的社会主义分配原则进行分配。同时应当首先履行对国家应当缴纳的义务（包括农业税、机械代耕费、归还到期的贷款等）；然后再留出高级社内的一切基金（包括公积金、公益金、下年的生产费等）；其余的实物和现金收入按劳动日进行分配。这样就可使国家利益、合作社利益、社员利益三者密切结合起来。开始时期，有些社由于对这一社会主义分配原则认识不明确，强调社员多分红，以至发生“先社员，再合作社，后国家”的分配方法，有的社为了显示“优越性”，不愿还国家贷款，不留公积金，不留下年生产费。后来扭转了这种错误做法，贯彻执行了社会主义的分配原则，1955年各高级社的收益分配工作，普遍反映“三头满意”。高级社扩大生产主要靠合作社内部积累，而发展社的公共经济又是增进社员的福利的主要源泉。因此进行收益分配时必须留够下一年的生产费用和一定数量的公积金、公益金。在过渡到高级社的初期，一般公积金留纯收入的10％左右，公益金留纯收入的2％左右为宜，以后随着生产的发展，再酌情提高。
    五、高级社建立和发展的过程，是社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争的过程。在初级社过渡到高级社过程中，曾经发生过地主、富农和反革命分子进行造谣、挑拨、毒害牲畜等破坏活动。为了保证社会主义的胜利，必须加强党的领导和对社员的政治思想教育工作。首先是贯彻执行党在农村的阶级路线。初级社的社员由于占有生产资料的情况不同，经济状况仍然是不平衡的，因此他们对向高级社过渡的态度也不一样。初级社向高级社过渡中，除了在生产资料的处理上应体现阶级政策外，在组织成员和领导成员上，也必须保证贫农的优势。
    其次要加强党对社员的思想教育工作。高级社更具备建立经常的政治思想工作制度的条件，教育内容也更丰富。应当联系合作社的优越性，向社员进行爱国主义和集体主义思想教育，不断清除资本主义思想影响和克服小生产者的落后保守习惯；还应当经常教育社员防止和克服认为高级社比别人“高一头”的骄傲自满情绪，教育社员团结和帮助初级社和社外农民进步，发动社员开展社会主义劳动竞赛，保证完成和超额完成生产计划。
    最后，在办高级社中，必须依靠党支部，加强支部在高级社中的战斗堡垒作用。由于高级社规模比较大，党员和团员比较多，应当以社为单位建立党、团支部，以生产队为单位建立党、团小组，使党、团组织接近社的一切生产活动，密切和群众的联系，保证党的政策和决议的贯彻执行。
