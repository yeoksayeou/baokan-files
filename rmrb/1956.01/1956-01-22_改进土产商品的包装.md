To the Editor:

    I am a staff member of the Fourth Wholesale Store of the Shanghai Municipal Company of the China National Native Produce Corporation. We receive goods shipped from other locations, and many of them are scattered all over the stations or docks because the packaging is not secure.

    From November 26 to December 7, 1955, three batches of peach kernels were shipped from the Guizhou Provincial Trading Company, totaling 77 pieces. The boxes containing these peach kernels were all broken, so much so that some were only half full. Recently, I picked up 6,340 packages of walnuts shipped from Tianjin on the Peace No. 9 steamer. The packaging of these walnuts was also almost entirely broken. The leftover walnuts picked up on the dock and in the ship's hold alone filled 45 sacks; the walnuts that rolled into the Huangpu River from the dock and were crushed by people were impossible to count. I negotiated with the Port Authority and received a "Business Record" stating: "The packaging of the goods is not secure, and the weight is short, which shall be handled by the owner of the goods."

    The main reasons for the dilapidated packaging of native products are that the wooden boxes are missing nails, the sacks are unsewn, broken bags are not repaired, or thin-board boxes are not protected by bundling ropes. These situations can be avoided as long as the personnel of the shipping department are practically responsible in their work. Therefore, the commercial departments should take effective measures to improve the packaging of native products. In addition, the transportation departments should also be responsible in this regard. At present, when they accept consignment, they do not care about the packaging as long as someone notes "losses shall be borne by the owner of the goods" in the business record. This practice of disregarding the loss of state property should be changed.

    改进土产商品的包装编辑同志：
    我是中国土产公司上海市公司第四批发商店的工作人员。我们商店收到从外埠运来的商品，有很多都因为包装不牢，在车站上或码头上撒得遍地皆是。
    1955年11月26日到12月7日，从贵州省贸易公司运来了三批桃仁，共77件。这些桃仁的装箱全部是破的，以致有的漏得只剩了半箱。最近，我在和平九号轮船里提取从天津运来的核桃6，340包。这些核桃的包装也几乎全部都是破的。光是在码头上和船舱里检起来的地脚核桃，就装了45麻袋；从码头上滚入黄浦江的核桃和被人踏碎压碎的核桃，更无法计数。我向港务局交涉，得到的是一张“商务记录”，上面注明：“该货包装不固，斤量短少，由货主自理”。
    土产商品包装破烂的主要原因是木箱脱钉，麻袋脱口，破包没有修补或者薄板箱外面没有加捆绳保护。这些情况，只要发货部门的经办人员工作切实负责，就可以避免的。因此，商业部门应该采取有效措施，改进土产商品的包装工作。此外交通运输部门在这方面也应该负责任。目前他们在接受托运的时候，只要有人在商务记录里注明“损失由货主自理”的字样，就不管包装情况了。这种置国家财产损失于不顾的做法，是应该改变的。
