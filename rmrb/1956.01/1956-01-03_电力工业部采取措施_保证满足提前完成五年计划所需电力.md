Xinhua News Agency report: The Ministry of Electric Power is taking measures to ensure that the electricity needs of all sectors of the national economy are met to facilitate the early completion of the Five-Year Plan. The planned electricity generation for 1956 will be greatly increased compared to 1955.

The Ministry of Electric Power is formulating specific measures to achieve early power generation for capital construction projects in the electric power industry. In 1956, all electric power station capital construction sites will carry out cross-parallel operations of civil engineering construction and machinery installation, further promote advanced experience, and improve the degree of mechanized construction. This will enable 23 power generation and transmission projects to be put into production before the date stipulated in the Five-Year Plan, to supply more electricity to various industrial construction departments.

In view of the current situation that the production of some power generation systems is not safe enough, the Ministry of Electric Power requires all power generation systems to vigorously eliminate accidents and ensure safe power generation and transmission in 1956. At present, the Ministry of Electric Power is formulating specific "safety measures" and "maintenance measures" based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, and is preparing to hold a national electric power maintenance conference in the first quarter of 1956 to exchange advanced experience in maintenance from various regions.

The Ministry of Electric Power also plans to transfer some small-scale power generation equipment in 1956 to build some supplementary lines to connect and regulate power sources within the power system, in order to meet the electricity needed by various industrial enterprises after increased production. At the same time, all electric power bureaus are required to continue to promote the experience of Shanghai and other places in saving electricity in 1956.

    电力工业部采取措施
　　保证满足提前完成五年计划所需电力
    据新华社讯　电力工业部采取措施，保证满足国民经济各部门提前完成五年计划所需要的电力。1956年计划的发电量比1955年将有极大增长。
    电力工业部正在拟订实现电业基本建设工程提前发电的具体措施。1956年，各个电站基本建设工地都将进行土木建筑和机器安装的交叉平行作业，进一步推广先进经验和提高机械化施工程度。这样，就可以使23个发电、送电工程在五年计划规定的日期前投入生产，以供应各个工业建设部门更多的电力。
    根据当前有些发电系统生产还不够安全的情况，电力工业部要求各个发电系统1956年必须做到大力消灭事故，保证安全发电送电。目前，电力工业部正在根据苏联专家建议，制定具体的“安全措施”和“检修措施”，并且准备在1956年第一季度召开全国电业检修会议，交流各地检修方面的先进经验。
    电力工业部1956年还准备调动一部分小型发电设备，修建一些沟通和调剂电力系统内电源的补充线路，来满足各工业企业增产后所需要的电力。同时，要求各个电业局1956年继续推广上海等地节约用电的经验。
