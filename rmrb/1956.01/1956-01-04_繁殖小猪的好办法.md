Recently, many rural areas have adopted the Soviet advanced experience of "double mating" to increase the number of piglets. This method involves using two boars of different breeds to mate with the same sow, one after the other, within a time interval of five to ten minutes.

The continuous experiments conducted by the Haining County Breeding Station in Zhejiang Province showed that four sows gave birth to a total of 56 piglets in half a year, an increase of 40% compared to the previous single mating method. In the past, the Huaiguang Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Anhui Province bred 36 litters of piglets, averaging only seven piglets per litter. After adopting the "double mating" method, 21 litters produced 223 piglets, averaging more than ten and a half piglets per litter.

There are many benefits to implementing the "double mating" method. Piglets bred using this method have good physique and grow fast. They can grow to 160 jin in six months, while ordinary piglets can only grow to about 120 jin. Breeding using this method is generally accurate, making it easier to grasp the sow's gestation period, increase fine feed for the sow, and pay attention to grazing, which makes feeding management work much easier.

    繁殖小猪的好办法
    最近不少农村采用了苏联先进经验“双重交配”法增殖小猪。这个办法就是用两只不同品种的公猪，在相隔五分钟到十分钟的时间内，先后和同一只母猪交配。
    浙江省海宁县配种站连续进行试验的结果，有四只母猪在半年中共生了56只小猪，比过去单次交配增殖小猪40％。安徽省淮光高级农业合作社过去繁殖36窝小猪，平均每窝只有七头；采用“双重交配”法以后，21窝就生了223头，平均每窝达到十头半以上。
    实行“双重交配”法的好处很多。用这个办法繁殖的小猪体质好，长得快，六个月就能长160斤，一般的小猪只能长120斤左右。用这个办法配种一般都能配准，这样就容易掌握母猪产期，给母猪增加细料和注意牧放，使饲养管理工作方便不少。
