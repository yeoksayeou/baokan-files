Wei Dawei, Liang Feng, and Zhai Xiaowu, who defected from Taiwan by piloting an airplane, accused the American military personnel of their crimes in Taiwan to the Xinhua News Agency reporter.

Wei Dawei worked as an administrator at the headquarters of the US Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan from May to September 1955. He said that in every institution and unit of the Chiang bandit army, there were American military advisors who controlled the Chiang bandit army like masters controlling slaves. Even for minor matters, the units of the Chiang bandit army had to ask for instructions and report to the American military advisors; they dared not do anything without approval. Even Chiang bandit officers had to salute American soldiers.

Wei Dawei and others said that American soldiers in Taiwan behaved like overlords, running rampant and committing all kinds of outrages. They often saw American soldiers drinking, gambling, extorting, and blackmailing. American soldiers often barged into taverns and restaurants, ate and drank their fill, and did not pay a cent. Last summer, four American sailors in the Green Leaf Bar in Kaohsiung City were drinking and molesting women, and they beat the bar owner. In early November last year, two American soldiers secretly used cigarette lighters to set off firecrackers in a small shop on Zhonghua Road in Taipei City, causing a fire that completely burned down the shop, and the shop owner was burned. On the same day, the Chiang bandit’s "Minzu Evening News" even said that this was "an American friend playing a joke."

Wei Dawei and others had witnessed American soldiers brutally beating Taiwanese residents on many occasions. At the port of Kaohsiung, American sailors often beat rickshaw pullers who asked them for fares. Last autumn, on Zhongshan North Road in Taipei City, an American soldier not only refused to pay the fare for a ride but also beat the rickshaw puller. When other rickshaw pullers angrily stepped forward to rescue the man and surrounded the American soldier, the Chiang bandit military police even used violence to intervene, saying, "Don't cause international disputes." At the entrance of the International Theater on Chengdu Road in Taipei City, an American soldier brutally kicked down a businessman riding a bicycle, causing the businessman to be injured.

Zhai Xiaowu said that in the spring of last year, he saw an American sailor throw a raped woman out of a moving car on a highway near Kaohsiung City. The insulted woman broke her head, and blood flowed freely. These kinds of atrocities by the US military, in which they insulted Taiwanese women, occurred endlessly.

Wei Dawei and others said that the various atrocities of the US military in Taiwan had aroused great hatred among the Taiwanese people. Although the Chiang bandits were carrying out a reign of terror with secret agents in Taiwan, slogans such as "Americans Get Out of Taiwan" still often appeared on the walls of many cities.

    韦大卫等三人控诉美军在台湾的罪行
    从台湾驾驶飞机起义归来的韦大卫、梁枫和翟笑梧，向新华社记者控诉美国军事人员在台湾的罪行。
    韦大卫曾在1955年5月到9月在美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团总部做过管理员。他说，在蒋贼军的每一个机关、部队里，都有美国军事顾问，他们像主子对奴才一样地控制着蒋贼军。蒋贼军各单位那怕要做一点小事情，也要向美国军事顾问请示报告，不经批准就不敢去做。甚至蒋贼军官见了美国士兵都要敬礼。
    韦大卫等说，美国军人在台湾各地横行霸道，胡作非为。他们经常看到美国军人酗酒赌博和敲诈勒索。美国兵常常闯进酒馆、饭店，大吃一顿，不付分文。去年夏天，四个美国水兵在高雄市绿叶酒吧一面酗酒，一面调戏妇女，并且把这个酒吧的老板打伤。去年11月初，两个美国兵偷偷地用香烟火点燃了台北市中华路一家小商店的爆竹，引起火灾，把这座小商店全部烧光，店主烧伤。当日蒋贼的“民族晚报”还说，这是“美国友人开玩笑”。
    韦大卫等曾多次目睹美国军人横蛮地殴打台湾居民。在高雄港口，美国水兵常常殴打向他们索取车费的三轮车工人。去年秋天，在台北市中山北路，一个美国兵坐了车不但不给车费，反而殴打三轮车工人。当其他三轮车工人愤怒地上前救护，包围这个美国兵的时候，蒋贼军警竟用暴力干涉，说是“不要引起国际纠纷”。在台北市成都路国际戏院门口，一个美国兵曾经横暴地把一个骑自行车的商人踢倒，以致商人受伤。
    翟笑梧说，在去年春天，他曾在高雄市附近的公路上，看见一个美国水兵从开着的汽车里把一个奸污后的妇女扔出来。那个被侮辱了的妇女跌破了头，鲜血直流。美军这类污辱台湾妇女的暴行，层出不穷。
    韦大卫等说，美军在台湾的种种暴行，已激起台湾人民的极大仇恨。尽管蒋贼在台湾施行特务恐怖统治，但许多城市的墙壁上，依然常常出现“美国人滚出台湾”的标语。（新华社）
