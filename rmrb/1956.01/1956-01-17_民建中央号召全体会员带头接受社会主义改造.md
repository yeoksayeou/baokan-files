Following Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Xi'an, Shenyang and many other cities have already or are about to enter the high tide of overall joint state-private ownership. The active performance of our business community in this new stage has been praised by the people of the whole country. The Standing Committee of the Central Committee expresses warm congratulations to the business community for this socialist enthusiasm! And calls on local organizations and all members to further mobilize, under the leadership of the local Party and government, to fully invest in this great movement, to stand at the forefront of accepting socialist transformation in the work of overall joint state-private ownership of private industrial and commercial enterprises in various places, to make achievements, set an example, fully exert the leading role of the backbone, and resolutely struggle to assist the country in further realizing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

    私营工商业社会主义改造的高潮已经到来。在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，北京全市的资本主义工商业已经领先实行了全部公私合营。继北京之后，上海、天津、西安、沈阳和其他许多城市也已经或者就要进入全部公私合营的高潮。我们工商界在这个新阶段中的积极表现，得到全国人民的赞扬，中央常务委员会对于工商界这种社会主义积极性表示热烈祝贺！并号召各地组织和全体会员，进一步动员起来，在当地党政领导下，全力投入这一伟大运动，在各地私营工商业全部公私合营工作中，站在接受社会主义改造的最前列，作出成绩，树立榜样，充分发挥骨干带头作用，为协助国家进一步实现对于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造而坚决奋斗。
