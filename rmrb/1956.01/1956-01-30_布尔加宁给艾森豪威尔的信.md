Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 29th (TASS): The following is the letter from N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, to U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

    On January 25, Soviet Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the United States, Zarubin, met with U.S. President Eisenhower and handed him a letter written by N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

    The following is the full text of the letter:
    To His Excellency Dwight D. Eisenhower, President of the United States of America, Washington:

    Mr. President,

    I am deeply convinced that you share my concern about the current state of relations between our two countries, and I would like to share with you my views on possible ways to improve these relations.

    You will certainly agree that the current international situation requires all countries, and especially the major powers that bear special responsibility for ensuring universal peace and the security of all peoples, to take measures that will help to further ease international tensions, strengthen international trust and cooperation. This is in line with the ardent desire of all peoples, who wish to live peaceful and tranquil lives, and to contribute their material resources and energy to creative and constructive labor, as well as to the rise and prosperity of culture.

    We stated at the Geneva Four-Power Summit that we are willing to strive for the easing of international tensions and the improvement of international relations based on the principles of peaceful coexistence and practical cooperation.

    There is no doubt that the issue of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States has great significance for the further easing of international tensions.

    Therefore, the question arises: Measures must be taken to greatly improve relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America. Such an improvement in Soviet-American relations would be a major contribution to improving the overall international atmosphere and to the cause of maintaining and strengthening universal peace.

    The history of relations between our two countries convincingly proves that their friendly cooperation is in line with the highest interests of the two peoples, and that this cooperation was initially based on a desire for mutual understanding and mutual respect for sovereignty, and later on the common struggle against aggressive forces. The following situation cannot be said to be accidental: except for the period of foreign intervention against the young Soviet Republic, the people of our two countries have never fought each other, and there are no irreconcilable differences between them, either in the past or in the present, and there are no border or territorial issues that could be the object of dispute or conflict.

    Therefore, the Soviet people welcome with full understanding the words you spoke at the Geneva Four-Power Summit: "The American people want to be friends with the Soviet people. There are no natural divisions between our peoples or countries. There are no territorial conflicts or commercial rivalries. Historically, our two countries have been at peace with each other."

    Life itself proves that the basis for cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States is not accidental and temporary motives, but fundamental and lasting interests. This is especially evident in the fact that our two countries were allies during the two world wars.

    As a prominent military leader in the anti-Hitler alliance, you are particularly aware of the extremely important role that the combat cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States played in defeating the common enemy – fascist aggressors – during the years of World War II.

    Their combat alliance, cemented by the blood of the best sons of both peoples, gloriously withstood all the tests of the war imposed on our peoples by the aggressive forces of the West and the East. This alliance also included Great Britain, France, China, Poland, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Greece, and other countries in the alliance of freedom-loving peoples.

    It is regrettable that the friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States was undermined in the post-war period. The deterioration of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States, regardless of its causes, is contrary to the interests of the Soviet and American peoples and has a negative impact on the entire international situation.

    I believe you will agree with me that the different social systems of the United States and the Soviet Union should not prevent our two countries from maintaining political, economic and cultural relations that are beneficial to both our peoples. Before the Second World War, Soviet-American relations developed greatly, especially in the economic field. During the war, our two countries' relations underwent new development, which was widely supported by the people of our two countries, and at the same time strengthened their mutual sympathy. This once helped to speed up the end of the war and reduce the sacrifices of the people.

    Of course, it cannot be ignored that in the years associated with the "Cold War," serious differences arose between the Soviet Union and the United States on various international issues related to disarmament, ensuring European security, the German question, and certain issues related to the Far East, and the importance of the above-mentioned issues is understandable. As the recent Geneva Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference showed, although the positions of all parties on some of the issues discussed have become somewhat closer, the differences are still significant, and further efforts and time are needed to reach the necessary agreements on resolving the above-mentioned issues.

    However, maintaining the current state of Soviet-American relations will not help to resolve outstanding international issues. And the improvement of Soviet-American relations will be in line with the desire to develop friendly relations between our two countries, which can create a new international atmosphere that will help to resolve disputed issues through negotiations on a mutually acceptable basis.

    It cannot be ignored that the practical solution of the task of further easing international tensions and strengthening international trust, including improving relations between the United States and the Soviet Union, is in line with the interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as the interests of all other countries.

    I think you, Mr. President, will agree with the view that in the current conditions, international tensions contain the possibility of disrupting peace, thus bringing dangerous consequences to the people of all countries.

    In this regard, everyone knows that due to the existence of the latest means of warfare such as atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, various modern jet weapons and rocket weapons, as well as other weapons of mass destruction, if international peace is disrupted, the people of all countries will be in the same dangerous situation, and their territories, especially densely populated areas in highly developed countries, will be at risk of being devastated by atomic warfare.

    Now the most prominent responsibility of all countries than ever before is to care for the maintenance and strengthening of peace, and to care for how to resolve international disputes only by peaceful means in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations.

    There is no doubt that the Soviet and American peoples are equally concerned about stopping the arms race that forces them to spend their strength and funds on non-productive purposes. The current arms race not only puts a heavy military burden on the people of all countries, hindering the improvement of their material welfare, but also greatly increases the risk of new wars.

    The improvement of Soviet-American relations will help to stop the arms race and will promote a fuller use of the economic resources of all countries for peaceful benefits. In this case, the funds currently used for non-productive military spending can be used to improve the material welfare of the people – reduce taxes, increase real wages, and be used for housing and public construction, and to help backward countries in a way that benefits peace and consolidates international cooperation.

    All of this will help to greatly expand the capacity of the domestic market and develop international trade, while also ensuring a corresponding expansion of production and employment based on a high tide of peaceful economy.

    It should be admitted that some things have happened recently, and the positive role of these things cannot but affect the entire international situation. Last year was a year in which there was no war in any region of the world. In the most recent period, some complicated international issues left over from the end of the Second World War have been resolved. The Four-Power Summit was held in Geneva, which was the first since the end of the last war. The achievements we have made at this conference have been sincerely and warmly welcomed by the people of the world, who believe that these achievements are in line with their desires and expectations.

    In recent times, contacts between Eastern and Western countries, including the Soviet Union and the United States, have improved significantly, although these contacts are far from being extensive and sufficient. As far as the Soviet Union and the United States are concerned, the increased contacts show how willing the people of our two countries are to develop these contacts and friendly cooperation.

    In all these major international events, the Soviet Union has defended the interests of strengthening peace and friendship among all peoples. The achievements of these events are largely due to the cooperation between our two countries.

    I sincerely believe that the improvement of Soviet-American relations is an urgent necessity.

    In my opinion, the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and cooperation between our two countries can help to achieve this goal.

    This treaty can stipulate that both parties will develop and strengthen friendly relations between the Soviet and American peoples in the spirit of sincere cooperation and mutual understanding, on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual respect for national sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, and will only resolve all their international disputes by peaceful means in accordance with the provisions of the United Nations Charter.

    The treaty can also stipulate that both parties agree to promote the development and strengthening of economic, cultural and scientific cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States on the basis of mutually beneficial and equal principles.

    My colleagues and I believe that the signing of this treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States will make a significant contribution to the development of Soviet-American relations, and will be an action of great international significance.

    I am convinced that the proposal on the signing of a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States with the aim of improving Soviet-American relations and further easing international tensions in the interests of strengthening peace will be welcomed by you and will be well received by the peoples of the Soviet Union and the United States, as well as the peoples of other countries.

    I think that the treaty I have proposed can follow the principles of the draft attached to this letter.

    I hope to hear from you soon about your views on the issues I have discussed.

    With heartfelt respect,

        N. Bulganin

            January 23, 1956.

    布尔加宁给艾森豪威尔的信
    新华社讯　塔斯社莫斯科29日电：苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁给美国总统德·德·艾森豪威尔的信。
    苏联驻美国特命全权大使查鲁宾1月25日拜会了美国总统艾森豪威尔，把苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写的一封信交给他。
    下面是这封信的全文：华盛顿美利坚合众国总统德·德·艾森豪威尔阁下：
    尊敬的总统先生，
    我深深相信你同我一样对目前我们两国关系的状况感到关怀，我想同你谈谈我对于改善这种关系的可能途径的看法。
    你当然会同意，目前的国际局势要求所有的国家，首先是要求对保障普遍和平和各国人民的安全负有特别责任的大国，采取会有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势、加强国际信任和合作的措施。这是符合各国人民的热切愿望的，他们希望过和平和安宁的生活，把自己的物质资源和精力贡献给创造性和建设性的劳动，以及文化的高涨和繁荣。
    我们曾经在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上表示，我们愿意根据和平共处和实行事务性合作的原则争取缓和国际紧张局势和改善国际关系。
    毫无疑问，苏联和美国之间的关系问题，对进一步缓和国际紧张局势具有重大的意义。
    因此就产生了这样一个问题：必须采取措施来大大改善苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和美利坚合众国之间的关系。苏美关系的这种改善，将会是对健全整个国际气氛以及维护和加强普遍和平的事业的一个重大的贡献。
    我们两国之间的关系史令人信服地证明，它们的友好合作是符合两国人民的最高利益的，这种合作的基础起初是相互谅解的愿望和互相尊重主权，后来又是反对侵略势力的共同斗争。下面这种情况不能说是偶然的：除了对年轻的苏维埃共和国的外国干涉时期以外，我们两国人民从来没有互相作过战，他们之间过去和现在都没有任何不可调和的分歧，没有足以成为争执或者冲突对象的边境或者领土。
    因此苏联人民以充分谅解的心情欢迎了你在日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上说过的这样的话：“美国人民希望同苏联人民成为朋友。我们的人民或国家之间并没有什么天生的分歧。也没有领土上的冲突或商业上的竞争。在历史上说来，我们两国一直是和平相处的。”
    生活本身证明，苏联和美国合作的基础不是偶然的和暂时的动机，而是根本的和持久的利益。这首先特别明显地表现为，我们两国在两次世界大战期间都是同盟国。
    身为反对希特勒同盟中的一个卓越的军事领导者，你特别清楚苏联和美国在第二次世界大战的年代中的战斗合作在击败共同敌人——法西斯侵略者的事业中起了极其重大的作用。
    以两国人民优秀的儿子的鲜血所凝结成的他们的战斗同盟，光荣地经受了西方和东方侵略势力强加给我们人民的战争的一切考验。当时参加这一同盟的还有英国、法国、中国、波兰、南斯拉夫、捷克斯洛伐克、挪威、希腊和爱好自由的人民联盟的其他国家。
    真可惜，苏联和美国之间的友好合作关系在战后时期遭到了破坏。苏联和美国的关系的恶化，不管其原因如何，是和苏联和美国人民的利益相违背的，并且对整个国际局势发生坏影响。
    我认为你也会和我一样相信，美国和苏联社会制度的不同不应该妨碍我们两国保持有利于我们两国人民的政治、经济和文化关系。在第二次世界大战之前，苏美关系获得了很大发展，特别是在经济方面。在战争期间，我们两国间的关系有新发展，这种发展得到我们两国人民的广泛支持，同时又加强了他们之间的互相同情。这曾经促使战争加快结束，使人民的牺牲得以减少。
    当然，不能不考虑到，在和“冷战”时期相关联的年代里，苏联和美国之间在有关裁军、保障欧洲安全、德国问题以及有关远东某些问题的各种国际问题上发生了严重分歧，而上述问题的重要性是可以理解的。如最近的日内瓦四国外交部长会议所表明的，尽管各方在所讨论的某些问题上的立场已经有所接近，分歧仍然是重大的，必须有进一步的努力和时间来就解决上述问题达成必要的协议。
    但是，把苏美关系目前的情况保持下去是不会有助于解决悬而未决的国际问题的。而苏美关系的改进会符合发展我们两国友好关系的愿望，它可以创造一种新的国际气氛，而有助于通过谈判的办法在大家可以接受的基础上解决争执问题。
    不能不看到，在实际上解决进一步缓和国际紧张局势和加强国际信任的任务，其中包括改进美苏两国的关系，既符合苏联和美国人民的利益，也符合所有其他各国人民的利益。
    我想您，总统先生，会同意这样的看法：在目前的条件下，国际紧张局势蕴藏着使和平遭到破坏、从而为各国人民带来危险的后果的可能。
    在这方面，大家都知道，由于原子武器、氢武器、各种现代化喷气式武器和火箭武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器等最新式的战争手段的存在，国际和平如果一旦遭到破坏，各国人民就会处于同样危险的境地，他们的领土，首先是高度发达的那些国家中的人烟稠密的区域，就会有受到原子战争的浩劫的危险。
    现在各国比任何时候都要突出的责任是：关心维护和加强和平，关心如何只用和平手段根据联合国的宗旨和原则解决国际争端。
    毫无疑问，苏联和美国人民都同样关心停止那种迫使他们把力量和资金花费在非生产目的上的军备竞赛。目前的军备竞赛不仅使各国人民承担沉重的军费负担，妨碍了他们物质福利的提高，而且还大大地增加了新战争的危险。
    苏美关系的改善会有助于停止军备竞赛，会促进更充分地把各国的经济资源用于和平利益。在这种情况下，目前用于非生产的军事开支的资金就可以用来提高人民的物质福利——减少税收，增加实际工资，用来进行住房和公共建设、用来帮助落后国家以有利于和平和巩固国际合作。
    所有这一切会有助于大大扩大国内市场的容量以及发展国际贸易，同时也可以保证在和平经济高涨的基础上相应地扩大生产和就业人数。
    应当承认：最近发生了一些事情，这些事情的积极作用不能不影响整个国际局势。去年是世界任何一个地区都没有战争的一年。在最近一个期间，解决了第二次世界大战结束后所留下来的悬而未决的某些复杂的国际问题。在日内瓦举行了四国政府首脑会议，这是上次战争结束后的第一次。我们在这次会议中所取得的成果受到全世界人民真诚和热烈的欢迎，全世界人民认为这些成果是符合他们的愿望和期待的。
    最近时期，东西方国家、包括苏联和美国之间的接触有显著改进，虽然这种接触还远不能说是广泛的和足够的。至于说到苏联和美国，那末这种已有增加的接触表明，我们两国人民是多么愿意发展这些接触和友好合作。
    在这一切重大的国际事件上，苏联捍卫了加强和平和各国人民友好的利益这些事情之所以能取得成就，在很大的程度上是由于我们两国进行了合作。
    我真诚地相信，苏美关系的改善是迫切必要的事情。
    依我看来，我们两国之间缔结一项友好合作条约能够有助于达到这一目的。
    这项条约可以规定，双方将本着真诚合作和相互谅解的精神，在平等、互相尊重国家主权和不干涉内政各项原则的基础上发展以及加强苏联和美国两国人民之间的友好关系，并且根据联合国宪章的规定，只是通过和平的办法来解决自己的一切国际争端。
    条约也可以规定，双方同意促进苏联和美国之间以互利和平等的原则为基础的经济、文化和科学合作的发展和加强。
    我和我的同事认为，苏联和美国之间签订这一条约将对苏美关系的发展作出重大的贡献，同时将是一个具有重大国际意义的行动。
    我深信，关于苏联和美国签订一项目的在于按照加强和平的利益改善苏美关系以及进一步缓和国际紧张局势的友好合作条约的建议，将得到你这方面的欢迎，并且将得到苏美两国人民以及其他国家的人民的良好反应。
    我认为我所建议的条约可以遵循随信附上的草案的原则。
    我希望很快得知你对我所谈到的问题的看法。
    致以衷心的敬意
        尼·布尔加宁
          莫斯科克里姆林宫
            1956年1月23日。
