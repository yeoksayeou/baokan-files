    US-British Rivalry in the Middle East
    Cui Qi
    British Prime Minister Eden traveled to Washington on January 24 to hold talks with the heads of the US government. According to Western news agencies, due to serious differences between the US and Britain over Middle East policy, they may "prioritize" the discussion of the Middle East issue in order to formulate a so-called common policy. This shows that the contradictions between the US and Britain in the Middle East have developed to the point where they cannot be concealed, and the heads of the two governments have to bring these issues to the table.
    In recent years, under the impact of the national independence movements of the Middle Eastern countries, Western colonialists have felt that their footing is becoming increasingly unstable. They exclaimed that a "crisis" had occurred in the Middle East, and attempted to block the historical trend by any means necessary. However, they are all struggling desperately for their respective colonial interests, and the United States is taking advantage of Britain's difficulties to profit from them. This has made the contradictions between Western colonial countries, mainly the US and Britain, in the Middle East more acute. Now, Eden is visiting Washington amid the increasingly fierce open and secret struggles between the US and Britain. Although they say verbally that this meeting will enable both sides to reach a "understanding," the actual contradictions between the US and Britain in the Middle East cannot be reconciled. Eden himself revealed a pessimistic tone on the eve of his trip to the United States: "Of course, we will not agree on everything - free countries never agree on everything."
    The contradictions and competition between the US and Britain in the Middle East have deep roots. For a long time, the Middle East has been a place of contention for imperialist countries. At the end of World War I, due to the defeat of Germany and the disintegration of the Turkish Empire, Britain established its hegemony here, regarding the Middle East as the scope of the "British Monroe Doctrine." However, since World War II, American forces have expanded into the Middle East on a large scale, thus beginning a situation of US-British contention. As is well known, the United States used the "Truman Doctrine" and the "Fourth Point Plan" to interfere in issues such as the Suez Canal and Iranian oil, and relied on its strong economic strength to seize British positions in the Middle East step by step, expanding American power. The British Labour Party's "New Statesman" wrote when talking about the Middle East situation: "In 1945, Britain pushed France into the back seat, and now the United States has firmly grasped the steering wheel."
    As in other regions, an important means for the United States to expand in the Middle East is to establish military aggressive blocs. This policy was also requested by Britain and therefore received British support. However, the starting points of US and British policies are different. Britain wants to use the Middle East military bloc to consolidate its colonial power, while the United States wants to use this tool to establish its own colonial rule and drive away British forces. The entire process of the US and Britain establishing military blocs in the Middle East has demonstrated this contradiction. For example, after US Secretary of State Dulles visited the Middle East in 1953, he decided that Turkey, controlled by the United States, should come forward to organize the Middle East military bloc, and Western countries should not participate for the time being, wanting to use this to exclude Britain. However, Britain did not abide by Dulles's precepts at all. Immediately after the conclusion of the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, it squeezed into this group, and signed a new unequal treaty with Iraq, consolidating British power in Iraq. Recently, Britain has been particularly anxious to drag Jordan into the Baghdad Pact, one of the purposes of which is to strengthen British control over this country and expand British influence within the Baghdad Pact. Under these circumstances, the struggle between the US and Britain for leadership of the Baghdad Pact has become increasingly apparent.
    Another acute issue on which the US and Britain have serious differences in the Middle East is the Palestine issue. Originally, this problem was a product of US-British contradictions. After World War II, the United States used Zionist elements to seize control of Palestine from Britain, using it as a springboard for American expansion into the Middle East. The fierce struggle between the US and Britain once led to the 1948 Palestinian War. But since then, the contradictions between the US and Britain in this region have continued to develop, thus making the Palestinian dispute unresolved to this day. Both the US and Britain often declare that they hope the Palestinian issue can be "reconciled" as soon as possible, but in reality, neither of them has ever considered the interests of the Palestinian people, but rather competed to interfere in the Palestinian situation in order to strengthen their own position in this region. Recently, according to Israeli newspapers, Britain has expressed its unwillingness to accept the US monopoly position in Israel, and demanded the establishment of a British military base in southern Israel. These situations will only intensify the US-British contention in Palestine.
    Facts have proved that the contradictions between the US and Britain in the Middle East cannot be reconciled. The British "Daily Mail" wrote when talking about this situation: "The alliance of free countries is always faced with the danger of disintegration. There is a force that often separates them, this is a magnetic repulsion!" But what exactly is this "magnetic repulsion"? This is the conflict of interests between the monopoly capitalist groups of the US and Britain.
    The main object of the US and British contention in the Middle East is oil. The oil reserves in the Middle East account for about 60% of the capitalist world, and its oil layers are very close to the ground, with very low costs. Therefore, the huge profits have driven the Western oil monopoly groups crazy, and they have rushed to this place to compete for oil fields. In 1955, oil production in the Middle East region reached 160 million tons, most of which was plundered by US and British oil companies. In this regard, the influence of the United States is constantly increasing. In 1938, Britain once controlled 80% of the Middle East's oil production, but now the United States has replaced Britain's position.
    In recent years, the discovery of new oil fields in the Persian Gulf region has triggered new competition between the US and Britain. They completely ignore the sovereignty and interests of the Middle Eastern countries, and quarrel fiercely on other people's land. According to UPI, the Middle East oil issue was even touched upon in the preparatory talks for this US-British meeting. Britain threatened the United States that if the United States was unwilling to make concessions in the Persian Gulf region, Britain would "resist" the sales of oil extracted by the United States in Saudi Arabia. In addition to threats, there are also pleas. The "British Observer" reminded the US government: "Although Middle East oil is a useful supplement for the United States to obtain supplies from other sources, it is actually the only source for Britain to obtain supplies." However, will the United States really agree to Britain's demands? The American "Newsweek" once answered this question, saying that Britain's dispute over oil in the Persian Gulf region will only make the United States feel "painful"!
    Britain's competition with the United States also reflects the deep contradictions contained in British policy. On the one hand, it opposes the United States' expansion towards Britain, and on the other hand, it wants to use the United States to suppress the national independence movement in order to maintain its colonial positions. Because of this, recently, when the Baghdad Pact was strongly resisted by the people of the Middle East, Britain hurriedly sought assistance from the United States, asking the United States to join the treaty as soon as possible in order to share the risks; at the same time, it also asked the United States to take out more dollars to strengthen "aid" to the Middle East, attempting to paralyze the people's struggle. However, even in this situation, the differences between the US and Britain cannot be eliminated. Western news agencies revealed that the United States, out of its own considerations, is unwilling to formally join the Baghdad Pact at the present time, and prefers to continue to operate behind the scenes.
    As for asking the United States to spend money to help Britain maintain its colonial power, that is even more unimaginable. The situation is exactly the opposite. The United States is taking the opportunity to force Britain to retreat from the Middle East so that the United States can replace it. Recently, especially on the eve of Eden's visit to the United States, a series of voices that made Britain feel harsh have been constantly transmitted from across the Atlantic, which is by no means accidental. The American propaganda machine openly stated that Britain's policy in the Middle East is "no longer in line with the trend of the times." The United States should "try to get the British to withdraw from their still dominant, but untenable, position in the Middle East." "Britain's previous imperialism can and must be replaced by America's economic development plan." The "New York Times" even arrogantly stated that Britain once dominated the Middle East in the 19th century, and now it should be the United States' turn.
    The US and British aggressive activities in the Middle East and the fierce struggle between them are the fundamental cause of the tense situation in the Middle East. The people of the Middle East understand who is threatening their peace and independence. They oppose British colonialism and also oppose American colonialism. Whether it is British aggressive forces or American aggressive forces, they will be driven out by the people of the Middle East. Only the people of the Middle Eastern countries are the true masters of the Middle East. Only the people of the Middle Eastern countries can decide the future of the Middle East. They are advancing victoriously on the road to national independence and freedom.

    美英在中近东的角逐
    崔奇
    英国首相艾登已于1月24日前往华盛顿，同美国政府首脑举行会谈。据西方通讯社透露，由于美英对中东的政策发生严重分歧，他们可能“优先”讨论中东问题，以便制定所谓共同的政策。这表明美英在中东的矛盾已经发展到无法掩饰的地步，两国政府首脑不得不把这些问题拿到桌面上来了。
    近年来，在中近东各国人民的民族独立运动的冲击下，西方殖民者已经感到他们的脚跟越来越不稳了。他们惊呼中东发生了“危机”，企图不择手段地来阻挡历史的潮流。但是，他们都是为了各自的殖民利益而拚命挣扎，美国则更利用英国遇到困难的机会从中渔利。这就使西方殖民国家之间，主要是美英之间在中近东的矛盾更加尖锐化。现在，艾登就是在美英明争暗斗日益剧烈的情况下去访问华盛顿的。虽然他们在口头上说这次会谈将使双方获得“谅解”，但是美英在中近东的实际矛盾是不可能调和的。艾登本人在赴美前夕也流露了悲观论调：“自然罗，我们将不会在每一件事情上取得一致意见——自由国家从来不是都取得一致的。”
    美英在中近东的矛盾和竞争是有着深远的根源的。很久以来，中近东就是帝国主义国家互相争夺的场所。第一次世界大战末，由于德国的失败和土耳其帝国的瓦解，英国曾在这里建立了自己的霸权，把中近东看作是“英国门罗主义”的范围。但是，第二次世界大战以来，美国势力大规模伸入中近东，从而开始了美英争夺的局面。如所周知，美国利用“杜鲁门主义”和“第四点计划”，通过对苏彝士运河和伊朗石油等等问题的干涉，并依靠它的雄厚的经济力量，一步一步地夺取英国在中近东的阵地，扩张了美国的势力。英国工党的“新政治家杂志”在谈到中东局势时就曾写道：“在1945年，英国把法国推到汽车后座去，而现在美国已经牢牢地掌住了驾驶盘。”
    和在其他地区一样，美国在中近东进行扩张的重要手段是建立军事侵略集团。这种政策也是英国所要求的，因此得到英国的支持。但是，美英政策的出发点是不同的。英国想利用中东军事集团来巩固它的殖民势力，美国则想利用这个工具来建立自己的殖民统治，并把英国势力赶走。美英在中近东建立军事集团的整个过程都表现了这种矛盾。例如，美国国务卿杜勒斯在1953年到中近东进行活动后，决定由美国所控制的土耳其出面组织中东军事集团，西方国家都暂时不参加，想借此排斥英国。但是，英国根本没有遵守杜勒斯的戒律，而是紧跟着土耳其—伊拉克条约成立后，它就挤进了这个集团，并和伊拉克签订了新的不平等条约，巩固了英国在伊拉克的势力。最近，英国特别焦急地想把约旦拖入巴格达条约，其目的之一也就是想加强英国对这个国家的控制，并扩大英国在巴格达条约内部的影响。在这些情况下，美英争夺巴格达条约的领导权的斗争已日益表面化了。
    美英在中近东发生严重分歧的另一个尖锐问题是巴勒斯坦问题。本来，这个问题就是美英矛盾的产物。第二次世界大战以后，美国利用犹太复国主义分子，从英国手中夺取了对巴勒斯坦的控制权，把它作为美国伸入中近东的一个跳板。美英之间的剧烈斗争曾经酿成了1948年的巴勒斯坦战争。但是从那以后，英美在这个地区的矛盾仍然在继续发展，因此使得巴勒斯坦争端迄今未获解决。英美双方都经常宣称他们希望巴勒斯坦问题能够早日“和解”，可是实际上他们谁也不曾为巴勒斯坦人民的利益着想，而是竞相干涉巴勒斯坦的局势，来加强自己在这个地区的地位。最近，据以色列报纸报道，英国对美国在以色列的独占地位表示不甘心，而要求在以色列南部建立英国的军事基地。这些情况只会使美英在巴勒斯坦的争夺更加剧烈起来。
    事实证明，美英在中近东的矛盾是不可能调和的。英国“每日邮报”在谈到这种情况时写道：“自由国家的联盟老是面临着瓦解的危险。有一种力量经常把它们分开，这是一种磁斥力！”可是，这种“磁斥力”究竟是什么呢？这就是美英两国的垄断资本集团之间的利益冲突。
    美英两国在中近东争夺的主要对象是石油。中近东的石油蕴藏量占资本主义世界的60％左右，它的油层离地面很近，成本非常便宜。因此，巨大的利润使西方石油垄断集团发疯了，他们争先恐后地到这里来争夺油田。1955年，中近东地区石油产量已达16，000万吨，其中大部分都被美英石油公司掠走了。在这方面，美国的势力正在不断增大。1938年，英国曾经控制中近东石油产量的80％，但是现在美国已经代替了英国的地位。
    近年来，由于在波斯湾地区发现新的油矿，引起了美英之间新的竞争。他们根本不管中近东国家的主权和利益，而站在别人的土地上大肆争吵。据合众社说，甚至在这次美英会谈的预备会谈中就触到了中近东的石油问题。英国曾向美国威胁说，如果美国不肯在波斯湾地区让步，英国就要“抵制”美国在沙特阿拉伯所开采的石油的销路。除了威胁，还有哀求。“英国观察家报”提醒美国政府说：“虽然中东的石油是美国从其他来源取得供应的一个有用的补助，但是它实际上是英国取得供应的唯一来源。”然而，美国真的会同意英国的要求吗？美国“新闻周刊”曾经回答过这个问题，它说英国对波斯湾地区石油的争执，只会使美国感到“痛苦”！
    英国在同美国的竞争中，也反映了英国政策中所包含的深刻矛盾。它一方面反对美国向英国进行扩张，一方面又想利用美国来镇压民族独立运动，以维持自己的殖民阵地。就是因为这样，近来，在巴格达条约遭到中近东人民强烈反抗的时候，英国急急忙忙向美国求援，要求美国早日加入这个条约，以便共同担当风险；同时它还要求美国拿出更多的美元，加强对中近东的“援助”，企图麻痹人民的斗争。但是，即使在这种情况下，美英之间的分歧还是不能消除的。西方通讯社透露，美国出于它自己的考虑，不愿意在目前这样时候正式加入巴格达条约，而宁愿继续在幕后活动。
    至于要求美国出钱来帮助英国保持它的殖民势力，那就更不可想像了。情况恰恰相反，美国正在乘机压迫英国从中近东退却，以便由美国取而代之。最近期间，特别是在艾登访美的前夕，从大西洋彼岸不断传来一片使英国感到刺耳的声音，这绝不是偶然的。美国的宣传机关公开说，英国在中近东的政策已经“不再符合时代潮流”。美国应该“设法使英国人退出他们在中东的仍占优势的、然而是站不住脚的地位”。“英国以前的帝国主义可以而且必须由美国的经济发展计划取而代之”。“纽约时报”更狂妄地说，19世纪英国曾经称霸中近东，而现在应该轮到美国了。
    美英在中近东的侵略活动和它们之间的剧烈斗争，是中近东紧张局势的根本原因。中近东人民懂得是谁在威胁他们的和平和独立。他们反对英国的殖民主义，也同样反对美国的殖民主义。不论英国侵略势力，还是美国侵略势力，都将被中近东人民赶出去。只有中近东各国人民才是中近东的真正主人。只有中近东各国人民才能决定中近东的前途。他们正在争取民族独立和自由的道路上胜利前进。
