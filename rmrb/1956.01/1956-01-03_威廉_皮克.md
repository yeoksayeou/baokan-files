Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, is a renowned activist in the German and international workers' movement, and one of the founders and leaders of the Communist Party of Germany and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

Pieck was born on January 3, 1876, into a worker's family in Guben. In his youth, he was an accomplished carpenter. In 1894, Pieck began participating in the revolutionary German workers' movement, joining the German Social Democratic Party the following year. From 1896, Pieck served as a staff member of the Social Democratic Party and trade union organizations in Bremen, where he led workers' strikes. In 1906, Pieck was elected secretary of the Bremen local party organization.

Pieck stood alongside left-wing Social Democratic leaders and outstanding fighters of the German proletariat such as Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, and Clara Zetkin, resolutely opposing the opportunist policies of the Social Democratic Party's leadership at various party congresses. In 1910, Pieck became the second secretary of the Party Central Education Committee, specifically responsible for the work of the party school.

During the First World War, Pieck waged a tenacious struggle against the German imperialist war policy and the treacherous actions of right-wing Social Democratic leaders who supported the imperialist war. In 1914, Pieck realized Liebknecht and Luxemburg's plan to publish the "International" magazine, which promoted the position of revolutionary socialists to the masses, calling for opposition to the domestic militarist rulers and striving to end the imperialist war.

On May 28, 1915, Pieck, entrusted by the left-wing of the Social Democratic Party, organized the first peace demonstration by the German people. Pieck was arrested in the demonstration and, after five months of imprisonment, was sent to the front. In the army, Pieck continued to conduct anti-war propaganda. In January 1918, Pieck resided in the Netherlands, where he participated in the work of the "Struggle" (Kampf) magazine, an organ of German political exiles.

Pieck actively participated in the 1918 struggle to overthrow the government of Kaiser Wilhelm, working alongside Liebknecht to carry out revolutionary agitation among German workers and soldiers. At the end of 1918, the left-wing of the Social Democratic Party formed the Communist Party of Germany. Pieck was elected as a member of the Central Committee. In the years before Hitler came to power, Pieck, as a member of parliament, used the platform of the German parliament to promote the Communist Party's policies, goals, and current tasks, and to advocate friendship with the Soviet Union. Pieck was also an active figure in the Comintern, serving as a member of the Presidium and Secretary of the Executive Committee of the Comintern from 1931 onwards.

During the dark days of Hitler's rule, Pieck, together with the leadership of the German Communist Party and international comrades, examined the struggle of anti-fascist forces against Hitler and planned new paths of struggle. At the Brussels Conference of the German Communist Party in 1935, Pieck was elected Chairman of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, succeeding Ernst Thälmann, who had been arrested by Hitler.

From 1941 to 1945, Pieck supported the Soviet Union's just war against fascist Germany. After Hitler's Germany was crushed by the Soviet army, Pieck gathered the members of the German Communist Party to carry out arduous post-war reconstruction work on the ruins of the war. In 1946, the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party in eastern Germany carried out a historically significant merger, forming the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. Pieck made great efforts to unify the two parties. After the formation of the Socialist Unity Party, Pieck and Walter Ulbricht jointly served as the chairmen of the party.

After the founding of the German Democratic Republic in October 1949, Pieck was elected as President. He led the people of the Republic in selfless struggle to defend peace, strive for the restoration of German unity, and consolidate and develop the first worker-peasant state in German history. Due to his great contributions to the Republic, Pieck was awarded the title of "Hero of Labor" and the first-class "Order of Merit for the Fatherland." (Xinhua News Agency)
