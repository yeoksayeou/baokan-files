Explanation of "Provisional Regulations on Rewarding Model Agricultural Production Increases"

    Carrying out patriotic production increase competitions and rewarding model workers are important policies of our country and also effective political work. In 1951, during our country's recovery period, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government formulated the "Trial Measures for Rewarding Agricultural Bumper Harvests," which was approved and issued by the former Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council. This greatly encouraged farmers' patriotic enthusiasm for increasing production, and many bumper harvest units and individuals emerged. However, because this method prematurely adopted a unified national high-yield standard system, and the rewards focused too much on small-area bumper harvests, biases such as falsely reporting yields occurred in some areas during implementation. In 1953, this situation was inspected, and with the approval of the former Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council, the "Instructions on Carrying Out Patriotic Production Increase Competitions and Rewarding Production Increase Models" was issued in April 1954, changing the unified high-yield standard system to a local quota selection system based on yield, and implementing central, provincial, and county-level rewards. These instructions took into account regional differences, so that farmers in areas with poor production conditions who were actively involved in production could also be rewarded. Now, based on the spirit of these instructions and combined with the new situation of the growth of socialist agricultural enterprises and the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives in our country, these regulations have been re-formulated, reported to the State Council for approval, and issued by the Ministry of Agriculture for implementation, to further promote agricultural collectivization and the patriotic production increase movement.
    This regulation adopts a local quota selection system based on yield. This method can not only establish high-yield banners, but also take into account the complex conditions such as the differences in natural conditions and the different production bases in various regions, and can encourage the production enthusiasm of a greater number of farmers.
    This regulation embodies the spirit of mainly rewarding semi-socialist and socialist economic components in agriculture. Rewarding these units will drive the majority of farmers to further embark on the road of collectivization. At the same time, appropriate consideration has also been given to individual farmers, herdsmen, fishermen, etc.
    This regulation also embodies the principle of rewarding large-area production increases. Article 3 regarding the calculation standards for award-winning achievements fully illustrates this point. This can effectively promote large-area production increases. At the same time, this regulation also embodies the principle of rewarding multi-faceted production increases, not only rewarding the increase in crop production, but also rewarding the increase in animal husbandry, aquatic products, special products, etc. This is in line with the current diversified operations of agricultural production cooperatives and the national goal of comprehensively increasing agricultural production.
    This regulation also pays attention to improving the importance of agricultural science and technology. In order to develop our country's agricultural science and technology, scientific and technical personnel, employees of state-owned agricultural enterprises, and working farmers, herdsmen, and fishermen who have improvements and innovations in agricultural production increase technology, and who have significant results in popularizing advanced production increase technology, will also be rewarded to encourage them to study and create, work hard to popularize science and technology, further improve agricultural technology, and increase production.
    This regulation also raises the conditions for award-winning units and individuals to apply for awards again in order to encourage them to continuously increase yields and strive for greater production increase achievements.
    Regarding the awarding of prizes, these regulations adopt a method that combines rewarding collectives and individuals to enhance the unity within the rewarded units and prevent the growth of individual heroism.
    Rewarding model production increases must be combined with carrying out mass patriotic production increase movements centered on developing agricultural cooperation in order to truly play a positive role in promoting production. It is necessary to prevent the bias of separating from the agricultural cooperation movement, separating from the agricultural production increase movement, and carrying out rewards in isolation. In order to carry out rewards effectively, in actual implementation, the province should focus on grasping the work of socialist agricultural enterprises such as state-owned farms and the work of various special districts and counties, and the county should focus on grasping the situation of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups, and regularly give guidance and assistance, and carefully conduct evaluation and review.
    Holding agricultural labor model conferences to award prizes is the most appropriate method. In the future, provinces and counties should hold such conferences in a planned and prepared manner, and make full use of this conference format to give play to the role of labor models in mutual evaluation and competition. With the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives and the continuous increase in farmers' enthusiasm for production, it is even more urgent to deepen the competition and reward work. After the promulgation of these regulations, all provinces should widely publicize them, closely combine the work of rewarding model agricultural production increases with the patriotic enthusiasm of the masses for increasing production, promote the agricultural production increase movement to a new climax, and strive to victoriously achieve the agricultural production increase tasks in our country's first five-year plan.

    “关于奖励农业增产模范暂行规定”的说明
    开展爱国增产竞赛，奖励劳动模范，是我们国家的重要政策，也是一项有效的政治工作。1951年我国生产恢复时期，中央人民政府农业部曾经制定农业丰产奖励试行办法，由前政务院财政经济委员会批准发布，这曾经大大鼓舞了农民的爱国增产积极性，出现了很多丰产单位和个人。但是，由于这一办法过早地采用了全国统一的高产标准制，奖励偏重于小面积的丰产，因而在执行中曾在一些地方产生虚报产量等偏向。1953年检查了这种情况，经过前政务院财政经济委员会批准，在1954年4月发布了“关于开展爱国增产竞赛和奖励增产模范的指示”，改统一的高产标准制为以产量为基础的地方名额选送制，并实行中央、省、县三级奖励。这个指示照顾了地区差异，使生产条件差的地区，生产积极的农民也能受到奖励。现在根据这个指示精神，结合我国社会主义农业企业的增长和农业生产合作社大量发展的新情况，重新制定本规定，报经国务院批准，由农业部发布施行，进一步地推动农业合作化和爱国增产运动。
    这个规定，采取了以产量为基础的地方名额选送制，这个办法既能树立高产旗帜，又可以照顾各地区自然条件的差异和生产基础的不同等复杂情况，可以鼓舞更大多数农民的生产积极性。
    这个规定，体现了以奖励农业中半社会主义经济和社会主义经济成分为主的精神，通过对这些单位的奖励，将会带动广大农民进一步走上合作化的道路。同时，对于个体农民、牧民、渔民等也作了适当的照顾。
    这个规定，也体现了奖励大面积增产的原则，第三条关于获奖成绩计算标准的规定，完全说明了这一点。这样就能有效地推动大面积增产。同时，这个规定还体现了奖励多方面增产的原则，不仅奖励农作物的增产，而且也奖励畜牧、水产、特产等的增产，这是适应当前农业生产合作社多种经营和国家要求农业全面高涨的目标的。
    这个规定，也注意了提高农业科学技术的重要性。为了发展我国的农业科学技术，对于科学技术工作人员、国营农业企业的职工和劳动农民、牧民、渔民在农业增产技术上有改进和创造发明的，在推广先进增产技术上有显著成效的，也都给以奖励，鼓励他们去钻研创造，努力进行科学技术的普及工作，进一步改进农业技术，提高生产。
    这个规定，又提高了获奖单位和个人再次报奖的条件，这是为了鼓励他们不断地提高产量，争取更大的增产成绩。
    关于给奖方面，本规定采取了奖励集体和个人相结合的办法，以增进受奖单位内部的团结，并且防止个人英雄主义的滋长。
    奖励增产模范，必须同开展群众性的以发展农业合作化为中心的爱国增产运动相结合，才能真正起到推动生产的积极作用，必须防止脱离农业合作化运动，脱离农业增产运动，孤立地进行奖励的偏向。为了切实有效地进行奖励，在实际执行中，省应该着重掌握国营农场等社会主义农业企业和各专区、县的工作情况，县应着重掌握农业生产合作社和互助组的情况，经常给以指导和帮助，并认真进行评选审查。
    召开农业劳动模范会议进行奖励，是最适当的方法，今后省、县应该有计划有准备地召开，充分利用这种会议的形式，来发挥劳动模范相互评比竞赛的作用。随着农业生产合作社的大量发展，农民生产积极性的不断高涨，深入开展竞赛奖励工作，更具有迫切的意义。在本规定发布后，各省应该广泛地进行宣传，把奖励农业增产模范的工作和群众的爱国增产热情密切结合起来，推动农业增产运动走上新的高潮，为胜利实现我国第一个五年计划中的农业增产任务而努力。
