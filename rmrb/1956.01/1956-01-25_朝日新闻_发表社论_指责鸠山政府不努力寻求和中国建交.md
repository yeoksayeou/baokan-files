Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 23rd: The "Asahi Shimbun" published an editorial on January 23rd, criticizing the Hatoyama government for violating its previous promises and failing to strive for the establishment of normal diplomatic relations with China.

The editorial, titled "Japan's Policy Direction Towards Asian Diplomacy," pointed out that the recent conference of Japanese diplomatic envoys to Asia and the Pacific region held in Tokyo has shown that the government is adopting a passive and ambiguous attitude towards China and neutral countries like India. The government convened this meeting ostensibly to strengthen Japan's relations with Asian countries; the Hatoyama Prime Minister's personal envoy, Takeo Miki, who is currently traveling in Southeast Asian countries, has also explicitly stated that he wants to promote Japan's reconciliation with its Asian neighbors. However, so far, these steps, which may actually be used to strengthen Japan's so-called "Asian diplomacy," have not produced any results.

The "Asahi Shimbun" said that Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu's speech at the recent diplomatic envoys conference reflected the government's inconsistent Asian foreign policy. At that time, he only emphasized the importance of "economic diplomacy" to Japan and deliberately ignored the most important but unresolved issue of establishing normal relations with China, and glossed over all issues full of political significance, which should actually be the focus of discussion. The "Asahi Shimbun" questioned: "Does the government really want to give up efforts to improve the unnatural relationship with the CCP?" The "Asahi Shimbun" emphasized that now is the time for Japan to seek reconciliation with "Communist countries" and neutral countries in Asia.

    “朝日新闻”发表社论
    指责鸠山政府不努力寻求和中国建交
    新华社23日讯　东京消息：“朝日新闻”1月23日发表社论，指责鸠山政府违反它以前的诺言，没有努力寻求和中国建立正常的外交关系。
    这篇题为“日本对亚洲外交政策的方针”的社论指出，最近在东京举行的日本驻亚洲和太平洋地区外交使节会议已经表明，政府对于中国和像印度这样的中立国家采取消极和含糊的态度。政府召开这次会议表面上是要加强日本对亚洲各国的关系；目前正在东南亚各国旅行的鸠山首相的私人特使三木武夫也明言要促进日本对亚洲各邻国的和解。但是到目前为止，这些实际上可能是用来加强日本的所谓“亚洲外交”的步骤并没有产生任何结果。
    “朝日新闻”说，外务相重光葵在最近举行的外交使节会议上的发言反映了政府前后不一致的对亚洲的外交政策，当时他只强调“经济外交”对日本的重要性，而有意地忽视了最重要但是还没有解决的对中国建立正常关系的问题，并且略而不提充满政治意义的一切问题，而这些问题其实是应该作为讨论中心的。“朝日新闻”质问道：“政府究竟是否想要放弃改善同中共之间的不自然的关系的努力呢？”“朝日新闻”强调说，现在正是日本寻求同“共产党国家”和亚洲的中立国家和解的时候了。
