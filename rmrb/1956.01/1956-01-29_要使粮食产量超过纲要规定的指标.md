To Exceed the Grain Production Targets Set by the Outline

To the Editor:

We have read with extreme excitement the National Agricultural Development Outline (Draft) for 1956 to 1967 proposed by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. This outline paints a beautiful picture of the countryside's future for us and points out the specific methods to achieve this future. This outline is our goal for the next 12 years of struggle. We must achieve it.

Article 6 of the outline stipulates that in the next 12 years, the average annual grain yield per mu in our area should increase from over 150 jin in 1955 to 400 jin. In 1955, the average annual grain yield per mu of our agricultural production cooperative was already 250 jin, and this year 98.7% of the farmers in the township have joined advanced agricultural cooperatives, resulting in more advantages in production. Therefore, we must greatly exceed the grain production targets set by the outline, and the average annual grain yield per mu in 1956 must reach 550 jin. This is guaranteed. Because the cooperative members have fully collected pig manure, road-rolling manure, kang soil manure, garbage manure, and other fertilizers, it is estimated that the entire cooperative can accumulate 473,000 dan of fertilizer before spring plowing, and each mu of land can be fertilized with 4,800 jin to 6,400 jin (last year, each mu of land was only fertilized with 2,400 jin); all the seeds this year have been carefully selected, and the yield will increase by about 25% as a result; large-scale water conservancy projects, staged topdressing, rational close planting, and full use of tractors for farming are all conditions that guarantee increased production.

On the basis of production development, the countryside will become a civilized and advanced countryside. The outline has made good arrangements for this aspect as well. Articles 30 and 31 stipulate that wired broadcasting and telephones should be installed in each agricultural cooperative. On the same day we saw the outline, telephone lines had already been erected in our township. The outline proposes to eliminate the "four pests"; a few days ago, our entire village basically eliminated sparrows and blocked all rat holes in a few days. The outline stipulates that illiteracy should be eliminated; this winter, the number of people in the township participating in literacy learning reached 100%.

On the road to building a socialist society, the outline has given us confidence, so everything is easy to handle. We thank the Party, thank Chairman Mao!

    要使粮食产量超过纲要规定的指标编辑同志：
    我们以极其兴奋的心情读完了中共中央政治局提出的1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）。这个纲要向我们描画出了农村的美好远景，并且指出了实现这个远景的具体办法。这个纲要，是我们12年中的奋斗目标。我们一定要实现它。
    纲要第六条规定：在今后12年内，我们这个地区粮食每亩平均年产量要由1955年的150多斤增加到400斤。我们农业生产合作社1955年粮食每亩平均年产量已经有250斤，而今年全乡98.7％的农户参加了高级农业社，生产中有了更多的优越性，因此，我们一定要使粮食产量大大超过纲要规定的指标，1956年粮食每亩平均年产量就要达到550斤。这是有保证的。由于社员们充分收集了猪圈肥、压路肥、炕土肥、垃圾肥等肥料，预计全社在春耕前可以积肥473，000担，每亩地可以施肥4，800斤到6，400斤（去年每亩地只施肥2，400斤）；今年的全部种籽都是经过精选的，产量将因此增加25％左右；大规模地兴修水利，分期追肥、合理密植以及充分利用拖拉机耕种，也都是保证增产的条件。
    在生产发展的基础上，农村将成为一个文明、先进的农村。这个纲要对这个方面也都安排得很好。第三十条、第三十一条规定要在各农业社里安装有线广播、电话。就在我们看到纲要的同一天，电话线路已经架到我们乡里来了。纲要里提出要消灭“四害”；前些日子，我们全村在几天时间里就基本上消灭了麻雀，堵塞了一切鼠洞。纲要里规定要扫除文盲；今年冬天全乡参加识字学习的人数达到了100％。
    在建设社会主义社会的道路上，纲要使我们心里有了底，因此一切事情都好办了。我们感谢党、感谢毛主席！
