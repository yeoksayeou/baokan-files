Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 8th: The German News Agency published on January 7th a report by the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, given on January 2nd at a cabinet meeting regarding the visit of the GDR government delegation to the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Mongolian People's Republic.

In his report, Grotewohl spoke of the great political importance of the delegation's visit and the warm welcome it received.

Grotewohl said: Our delegation's visit was a return visit to Premier Zhou Enlai's visit in 1954. This visit further strengthened the friendly relations between our republic and the People's Republic of China.

Grotewohl said that during the extensive negotiations with the leaders of the People's Republic of China, issues concerning relations between the two countries and other important political issues were discussed, such as the situation in the Far East, issues arising after the Bandung Conference, and other matters.

Both sides expressed consistent common views during the negotiations.

Grotewohl then emphasized the extremely important significance of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and the Joint Statement concluded between the two countries. Our views on the German question were endorsed in the Joint Statement, which stated that we can obtain the full support of our Chinese friends on this issue.

Grotewohl continued by saying that the delegation raised the issue of Germany's connection with China as a general national issue and acted accordingly.

When discussing the normalization of relations between China and the Federal Republic of Germany, Grotewohl said that he believed that there are broad sections of people in West Germany who recognize the need to establish cooperation between the whole of Germany and China. These people can see that the possibility of such cooperation now exists, and all representatives of German economic interests can find a wide range of activities in China. Therefore, West Germany should seriously consider all issues of cooperation with China.

Grotewohl continued by saying that the positions of the two governments, as clarified in the treaty and in the Joint Statement, are very clear: peace in Asia and peace in Europe are closely linked. Therefore, we affirm with certainty that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe, or the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact in the Far East and Near East, these military blocs are threats to peace; to ensure peace, they must be eliminated. We support the Five Principles announced by China and India, and we declare that we support all national aspirations of all countries to develop on this basis. Grotewohl pointed out that the enthusiasm of the Chinese people in building socialism deeply impressed the delegation. He said that the Chinese people are determined to defend their achievements, and no aggressor can ever gain a foothold in China again. Grotewohl then spoke about the delegation's visits to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Mongolian People's Republic, pointing out that the two sides held completely identical views during the talks. Grotewohl concluded by saying: On its way back home, the delegation exchanged detailed views with the Soviet government leaders on the issues of ensuring collective security in Europe and reunifying Germany into a peaceful and democratic country.

    在德意志民主共和国内阁会议上
　　格罗提渥作访问中朝蒙的报告
    据新华社柏林8日电　德意志通讯社在1月7日发表了德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥1月2日在内阁会议上所作的关于德意志民主共和国政府代表团访问中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国的报告。
    格罗提渥在报告里谈到了代表团这次访问的巨大的政治上的重要性，以及代表团在访问中受到热烈欢迎的情况。
    格罗提渥说：我们代表团的访问是对周恩来总理1954年的访问的回拜，这次访问使我们共和国同中华人民共和国的友好关系进一步加强了。
    格罗提渥说，在同中华人民共和国的领导人进行的广泛的谈判过程中，讨论了两国之间的关系问题和其他重要的政治问题，例如，远东的局势、万隆会议以后产生的问题和其他问题。
    双方在谈判过程中表现了一致的共同的观点。
    格罗提渥接着着重指出了两国间所缔结的友好合作条约和联合声明的非常重要的意义。我们在德国问题上的观点在联合声明中得到了赞同，声明中指出，我们在这个问题上可以得到中国朋友的全力支持。
    格罗提渥接着说，代表团把德国同中国的联系问题作为一个总的全国性问题提了出来，并且根据这一点进行了活动。
    在谈到中国同德意志联邦共和国关系正常化问题的时候，格罗提渥说，他相信西德有广泛人士承认有必要建立整个德国同中国的合作，这些人可以看到，这种合作的可能性现在已经有了，所有的德国的经济利益的代表人都可以在中国找到广阔的活动范围。因此西德应当认真地考虑同中国合作的一切问题。
    格罗提渥接着说，无论是从条约中或是从联合声明中阐明的两国政府的立场都很明显：亚洲的和平和欧洲的和平是密切联系着的。因此我们十分肯定地指出，无论是欧洲的北大西洋公约组织或是远东、近东的东南亚条约组织和巴格达条约，这些军事集团都是对和平的威胁；要保障和平，必须消灭它们。我们支持中国和印度所宣布的五项原则，并且声明，我们支持各国人民在这个基础上发展的一切民族愿望。格罗提渥指出，中国人民建设社会主义的热情给代表团很深印象，他说，中国人民决心保卫他们的成就，没有一个侵略者再能在中国立足。格罗提渥接着谈到代表团访问朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国的情况，他指出，在会谈中间，双方观点完全一致。格罗提渥最后说：代表团在回国途中，同苏联政府领导人就保障欧洲集体安全和重新统一德国为一个和平民主的国家的问题详细地交换了意见。
