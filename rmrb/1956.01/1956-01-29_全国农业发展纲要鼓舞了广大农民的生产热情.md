The publication of the National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956-1967 has inspired the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants. Farmers in Shanxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Sichuan provinces, as well as in the suburbs of Shenyang and Harbin, have unanimously expressed their determination to contribute their strength to the realization of this great program.

Agricultural labor models Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, Shen Jilan, and Wu Houli are holding discussions with peasants in Taiyuan and the suburbs of Taiyuan to share production experiences. Upon hearing the news of the publication of the draft National Agricultural Development Program, they were all very excited. They unanimously expressed their determination to complete and overfulfill the agricultural production increase targets they recently proposed to the nation's peasants in their initiative, aiming to achieve an average grain yield of 480 to 490 jin per mu this year.

Inspired by the draft National Agricultural Development Program, members of 156 advanced vegetable gardening agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Lanzhou, Gansu Province, have formulated preliminary plans for increasing vegetable and fruit production. They aim to increase melon production tenfold and fruit production eightfold within seven years compared to 1955. Vegetable production is to be increased from the current 140 million jin to 260 million jin.

The news of the publication of the draft National Agricultural Development Program greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of people of all ethnic groups in Hohhot to build socialism. More than 130 leading cadres from agricultural and pastoral departments of various leagues, administrative regions, banners, and counties who were attending the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Agricultural, Pastoral, and Forestry Production Conference in Hohhot studied and discussed the draft National Agricultural Development Program in groups. They unanimously agreed that this program points out a vision for the development of agricultural production and rural work and also points out the goals for agricultural workers to strive for. They unanimously expressed their determination to guarantee the completion of the production tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program and strive to overfulfill them.

People from all walks of life in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City are all rejoicing at the beautiful vision outlined in the draft National Agricultural Development Program. The directors of various agricultural cooperatives in the Second Township of Yanta District, one of Xi'an's "Thousand Jin Townships," have, based on the spirit of the draft program, raised this year's planned grain yield per mu from 1,000 jin to 1,500 jin, and aim to reach 1,600 jin next year. Zheng Guoxiang, director of the Yangjialing Agricultural Cooperative, the former residence of Chairman Mao in Yan'an, immediately consulted with the directors of agricultural cooperatives such as Wangjiaping to study the issue of merging and transforming into advanced cooperatives after hearing about the various contents of the draft National Agricultural Development Program, and discussed how to ensure the realization of the various tasks stipulated in the draft program.

The broad masses of peasants in Sichuan Province warmly welcome the draft National Agricultural Development Program. On the 26th, when the news reached the venue of the joint founding meeting of the Xiguang and Youyi two large advanced agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs of Chengdu, Luo Youxian, deputy director of the Xiguang Agricultural Production Cooperative, said: "Our entire cooperative, with 1,348 member households, is determined to increase the yield of rice per mu to 1,000 jin this year and to 2,050 jin in 1962, ensuring the early and overfulfillment of the production increase targets proposed in the program." More than 260 heads of agricultural cooperatives who were participating in the "Thousand Jin Competition" evaluation meeting in Yibin City held discussions, and many cooperatives are revising their production increase plans. The Shiping Cooperative will increase this year's yield of 1,160 jin of grain per mu to 1,300 jin.

Farmers in the suburbs of Shenyang City unanimously support the draft National Agricultural Development Program. Yang Xiangwu, an old poor peasant from the Bajiazi Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in the western suburbs, said excitedly that Chairman Mao is guiding us forward, and we must work hard to increase cotton production. In order to realize this draft program, the members of the Wuwu Agricultural Production Cooperative in the northern suburbs also proposed to produce 620 jin of grain per mu this year, which is 186 jin more than last year. By the autumn of this year, they will basically eliminate all sparrows in the village, and there will be no mice in the warehouses. The Gangtie and Zhaoming agricultural production cooperatives have also decided to open up more paddy fields to ensure the early realization of production increase targets.

Harbin City had just passed the city's carnival celebration of entering socialism, and on the 27th, the entire city was boiling again for the promulgation of the draft National Agricultural Development Program. The county party secretaries attending the rural work conference of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China felt confident that they would achieve a yield of 400 jin per mu by 1967. They also felt completely confident that they could complete the task of grain reserves ahead of schedule.
