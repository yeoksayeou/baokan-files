    Wuhan People Cheer the Victory of Socialist Transformation
    Yuan Jun
    On the morning of January 22nd, over 150,000 people in Wuhan held grand joint celebration parades in Hankou and Wuchang simultaneously amidst heavy snowfall, celebrating the great victory of socialist transformation throughout the city.
    In just two or three days, over 10,000 private industrial and commercial enterprises in Wuhan completed the task of transformation into joint state-private ownership. To celebrate this victory, many capitalists worked through the night with their employees to clear assets and actively increase investment. The extra-book assets provided by just 23 capitalists in the Yingwuzhou tobacco and alcohol industry doubled the industry's capital. On this day, when the capitalists' celebration teams appeared on the rostrum of the square, enthusiastic applause rang out from the crowd.
    For the first time, farmers from the suburbs of Wuhan participated in the city parade as socialist collective farmers, holding up huge charts. The charts read: all of the more than 1,200 agricultural production cooperatives in the suburbs, in their initial forms, have been completely transformed into advanced cooperatives, and the number of farmers joining the cooperatives has reached 98.8% of the total number of farmers in the suburbs. Now, they have also put forward a guarantee of increased production: this year, they will produce twice as much grain and vegetables as last year to meet the needs of the urban people.
    Handicraft laborers from more than 200 natural trades marched in the parade. The surging cooperative movement has drawn 95% of them into a happy collective life. They carried good news, beat gongs and drums, and marched in groups from streets to alleys. Due to the expansion of production organizations, many handicraft production cooperatives are already formulating plans for semi-mechanized production. The First Knitting Production Cooperative will increase its electric equipment by 150% this year, and its production plan is to increase by 250% compared to last year.
    The victory of socialist transformation has greatly inspired the working class of Wuhan, who are working hard to realize the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. They sent representatives to participate in the parade. When the parade passed in front of factories and construction sites, many employees applauded at the gates, cheering in unison with the parading crowd: Long live socialism! (Attached photo)

    武汉人民欢呼社会主义改造的胜利
    袁军
    1月22日上午，武汉市15万多人在漫天大雪中，在汉口、武昌两地同时举行了盛大的联欢游行大会，庆祝全市社会主义改造的伟大胜利。
    武汉市仅仅在两三天内，1万多户私营工商业就全部完成了公私合营的改造任务。为了欢庆这个胜利，许多资本家连夜和职工们一起清产核资，并且积极增加投资。仅是鹦鹉洲烟酒业的23个资本家拿出的账外资产，就使全业的资金增加了一倍。这天，当资本家们的报喜队出现在广场主席台上的时候，人群里响起了热烈的掌声。
    武汉市郊区农民，第一次以社会主义的集体农民的身份，高举着巨大的图表参加市内游行。图表上写着：全郊区1，200多个初级形式的农业生产合作社，已经全部转为高级社了，入社农户已经达到郊区农户总数的98·8％。现在，他们又提出了增产的保证：今年要比去年生产多一倍的粮食和蔬菜，供应城市人民的需要。
    来自200多个自然行业的手工业劳动者行进在游行的队伍里。汹涌澎湃的合作化运动，把他们当中95％的人卷进了幸福的集体生活里。他们拿着喜报，打着锣鼓，成群结队地从大街走到小巷。由于扩大了生产组织，许多手工业生产合作社已经在制定半机械化生产的规划。第一针织生产合作社今年就要增加电动设备一倍半，生产量计划比去年提高二倍半。
    社会主义改造的胜利，大大鼓舞了正在为提前实现第一个五年计划而紧张劳动的武汉工人阶级，他们派代表参加了游行，当游行队伍从工厂、从建筑工地前面走过的时候，许多职工到门口拍手欢迎，同游行的人群齐声欢呼：社会主义万岁！（附图片）
