    Winter Sports in Moscow

    The Moscow River has already frozen over, covered with a thick blanket of snow. The port that can navigate five seas has now become a quiet, white avenue. The suburbs of Moscow are covered in snow. The endless fir and birch forests are all dressed in white snow. The good days for winter sports for Muscovites have arrived.

    In various parks and sports fields, and in the grounds of many schools and cultural institutions, ice rinks of all sizes have appeared. On the ice rinks, people are not skating one after another, but group after group, skating non-stop like a revolving lantern. Some experts weave through the crowds, speeding past. Others are hand in hand in twos and threes. Some who are just learning fall and get up to skate again. In some places, beginners are practicing their footwork, pushing sled chairs.

    The figure skating performances held in the Central Culture and Rest Park are often packed. Young people excel in figure skating. Last year's All-Union champion, Tatyana Likhoreva, is a 15-year-old ninth-grade student. When six-year-old boys and girls nimbly dance lively Russian folk dances on the mirror-like ice rink, and when equally young boys and girls, dressed in national costumes, whirl around in a Czech dance, people can't help but cheer.

    If you ask a Muscovite what sports competition they like to watch most in winter, they will answer: "Ice hockey." This sport of ice hockey has only been popular in the Soviet Union for nine years, but the Soviet ice hockey team already enjoys a high reputation in the world. A few nights ago, an ice hockey match was held at the "Dynamo" stadium. Judging from the tens of thousands of sparks reflected in the dim light of the cigarettes people were smoking, it could be vaguely discerned that there were about twenty or thirty thousand spectators here. The light from dozens of searchlights was focused on the ice rink. The ice rink was surrounded by a waist-high wooden fence. Each team of six people, wearing ice skates, wearing tanker-style leather hats, and holding hockey sticks, ran wildly on the ice rink, chasing the rubber ball.

    People's interest in skiing is no less than that in skating. In the forests of East Izmailovo Park in the city, winter is no less lively than summer. Sleds have created many paths in the forest. Sokolniki Park and Lenin Hills are both good places for skiing. On Lenin Hills, opposite Moscow University, there is a steel-framed ski jump platform. Athletes from various sports groups practice ski jumping on the snow-covered slopes here every day. Recently, Boris Shenayev, a fitter at the Moscow Ball Bearing Factory, also jumped 60 meters here.

    On Sundays, when some people are still fast asleep, ski enthusiasts, old and young, men and women, have already braved the morning cold and set off to the ski resorts in the suburban forests. They push their poles, stride forward, glide across the open fields, delve deep into the forests, cross a slope, and then side-ski up another. They feast their eyes on the snow scenery and deeply breathe the fresh air of the winter snowfield.

    Shortly after the start of winter, nine workers from the Moscow "Three Mountains Textile Factory," in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the first Russian revolution, held a long-distance ski trip from Moscow to Leningrad. The youngest participant was 18 years old, and the oldest was 64 years old. The journey was pleasant and arduous. They all successfully reached their destination.

    Skating and skiing are truly mass sports in the Soviet Union.

### 莫斯科的冬季运动

    莫斯科的冬季运动
    莫斯科河已经冰封了，上面盖着一层厚厚的雪被。可以通航五海的港口现在变成了一条安静的洁白的大道。莫斯科郊外积雪遍野。连绵不绝的枞松林和白桦林都披上白绒的雪装。莫斯科人冬季运动的好日子来到了。
    在各个公园和运动场里，在许多学校和文化机关的场子里，出现了大大小小的冰场。在冰场上，滑冰的人们不是一个跟一个，而是一群接一群，像走马灯一般不停息地滑着。有些能手在人群之间左穿右绕，风驰而过。也有三三两两携手并进的。有些才学会的人，摔了跤爬起来再滑。有的地方，初学的人推着橇椅练习脚步。
    在中央文化休息公园举行的滑冰花样表演，往往座无虚席。少年在花样滑冰中最出色。去年全苏冠军塔捷扬娄·李霍列娃是15岁的九年级学生。当六岁的男孩和女孩们在镜面般的冰场上矫捷地跳着活泼的俄罗斯民间舞蹈的时候，当同样幼小的、穿着民族服装的一个男孩两个女孩打着捷克舞的旋风围的时候，人们都情不自禁地喝起采来。
    如果你问莫斯科人在冬天最喜欢看的运动比赛是什么？他会回答你：“冰球赛。”打冰球这个运动在苏联时兴还不过九年，但苏联冰球队在世界上已经享有盛誉了。前几天一个晚上，在“狄纳摩”运动场上举行了一场冰球赛。凭人们吸着的香烟在昏暗中映出的万点星火，依稀可以辨认出这里约有两三万观众。几十盏探照灯的光芒集中在冰场上。冰场围着半人高的木篱。两队各六个人，穿着跑冰鞋，戴着坦克手式皮帽，握着曲棍，在冰场上飞奔地追逐着橡皮球。
    人们滑雪的兴趣不下于溜冰。在市内东伊兹迈尔公园的树林里，冬天不比夏天寂寞。雪橇在林间开辟了许多路径。在索科尼奇公园和列宁山上都是滑雪的好地方。在列宁山上莫斯科大学对面筑有铁骨的跳雪板台。各个体育团体的运动员每天在这里向积雪的山坡练习跳雪板。最近，莫斯科滚球制造厂钳工波里斯·舍纳也夫在这里跳了60公尺远。
    星期天，当有些人们还在甜睡的时刻，滑雪爱好者，老的少的，男的女的，已经冒着早晨的寒风出发到郊外树林的滑雪胜地去了。他们撑动杆子，迈开大步，滑过旷野，深入树林，过了一坡，又侧着雪橇上了一坡。他们饱览雪景，深深地呼吸着冬日雪野上的清鲜的空气。
    在冬季开始后不久，莫斯科“三山纺织厂”的九个工人，为了纪念俄国第一次革命50周年，举行了从莫斯科到列宁格勒的长途滑雪旅行。最年轻的参加者18岁，最年长的参加者64岁。旅途愉快而辛劳。他们胜利地都到达了目的地。
    滑冰滑雪在苏联是真正群众性的运动。
