Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 2nd: The Indonesian "People's Daily" published the New Year's message issued by the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party on December 30th, on December 31st, 1955.

　　The message first reviewed the Indonesian people's struggle in 1955 to defend national independence and strive for democracy and world peace. The message cited several important events, including the Ali-Arifin cabinet's conclusion of the protocol to abolish the Dutch-Indonesian Federation and the Asian-African Conference held in Bandung.

　　After criticizing the current cabinet's policies, the message stated that the Indonesian Communist Party, based on the experience of all past cabinets and genuinely recognizing that the people had expressed their desire for changes in politics and life in this parliamentary election, had, while hailing the results of the parliamentary election, called for the organization of a national unity or national peace cabinet including the four major parties—the Indonesian Nationalist Party, the Indonesian Islamic Scholars Association, the Indonesian Communist Party, and the Masyumi Party—as well as other parties. This cabinet would be responsible for implementing a program like that of the Ali-Arifin cabinet, opposing colonialism, guaranteeing democracy, and supporting world peace. The Indonesian Communist Party had clearly pointed out that it was impossible to form a truly resolute anti-colonial national unity cabinet without the participation of the Indonesian Communist Party, which represents 20% of the Indonesian people.

　　The message continued that, however, the Masyumi Party leaders, fearing democracy, anti-colonialism, and a political program that supports world peace, and fearing the growth of the people's movement, unreasonably refused to organize a cabinet including the Indonesian Communist Party, that is, a national unity cabinet. Due to the refusal adopted by the Masyumi Party leaders, the Indonesian Communist Party no longer continues its efforts to organize a cabinet with the Masyumi Party, and calls on the people to organize a cabinet that does not include the Masyumi Party. This is the only correct response to the Masyumi Party's disregard for national unity and its hostile attitude towards the 20% of Indonesian people who support the Indonesian Communist Party.

　　The message said that as it enters 1956, the Indonesian Communist Party demands that, as a result of the parliamentary election, a progressive cabinet should be organized to realize national independence, guarantee domestic democracy, and support world peace, or, simply put, to form a cabinet that, like the mandate of the majority of people who voted in this parliamentary election, can change politics and the lives of the people.

　　When mentioning whether the Indonesian Communist Party must participate in the progressive cabinet it has proposed, the message said that participating in the government is the responsibility of the Indonesian Communist Party. However, in the current situation, participating in the government is not purely a matter for the Indonesian Communist Party. The attitude of the Indonesian Communist Party does not depend on whether the Indonesian Communist Party participates in the government. It depends first and foremost on what policies the government will adopt. As long as the government adopts progressive policies, the Communist Party will support it, even if the Communist Party does not participate in the government. This attitude does not in any way diminish the Communist Party's right to criticize the government it supports when necessary, as it did during the Wilopo cabinet and the Ali-Arifin cabinet.

　　The message said that all the Indonesian people—regardless of differences in religion, ethnicity, and social status—hope for a better Indonesia, a more united people, and better guarantees of various rights. The Indonesian Communist Party's message finally calls on all the Indonesian people to unite all forces to express their opinions, emotions, and aspirations.

### 印度尼西亚共产党发表新年文告

　　印度尼西亚共产党发表新年文告
    新华社雅加达2日电　印度尼西亚“人民日报”在1955年12月31日刊载了印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会政治局在12月30日发表的新年文告。
    文告首先回顾了印度尼西亚人民1955年保卫民族独立、争取民主和世界和平的斗争。文告举出了一些重要事件，包括阿里—阿里芬内阁缔结废除荷兰—印度尼西亚联邦的议定书以及在万隆举行的亚非会议。
    文告在批评了目前的内阁的政策以后说，印度尼西亚共产党根据过去所有内阁的经验，并且真正认识到人民在这一次国会选举中已经表示了他们希望政治和生活都有所改变的愿望，因此在欢呼国会选举的结果时曾经呼吁组织包括四大政党——印度尼西亚国民党，印度尼西亚回教师联合会，印度尼西亚共产党和马斯友美党——以及其他政党的民族团结或全国和平内阁。这个内阁将有责任执行像阿里—阿里芬内阁的纲领那样的反对殖民主义，保证民主和支持世界和平的纲领。印度尼西亚共产党已经清楚地指出，没有代表着20％的印度尼西亚人民的印度尼西亚共产党参加，是不可能组成真正坚决反对殖民主义的民族团结内阁的。
    文告接着说，但是，马斯友美党领导人物由于害怕民主、反殖民主义和支持世界和平的政治纲领和害怕人民运动的成长，毫无理由地拒绝组织包括印度尼西亚共产党在内的内阁，也就是民族团结内阁。由于马斯友美党领导人物所采取的拒绝态度，印度尼西亚共产党不再继续进行同马斯友美党一起组织内阁的努力，而号召人民组织不包括马斯友美党的内阁。这是对于马斯友美党不顾民族团结和对支持印度尼西亚共产党的20％的印度尼西亚人民采取敌视态度的唯一正确的答复。
    文告说，在进入1956年的时候，印度尼西亚共产党要求，由于国会选举的结果，应当组织一个进步内阁以实现民族独立、保证国内民主、并且支持世界和平，或者，简单说，组成一个像在这次国会选举中投票的大多数人民的委托那样能够改变政治和人民生活的内阁。
    文告在提到印度尼西亚共产党是否一定要参加它所建议的进步内阁的问题时说，参加政府是印度尼西亚共产党的责任。但是，在目前情况下，参加政府并不纯粹是印度尼西亚共产党的问题。印度尼西亚共产党方面的态度并不取决于印度尼西亚共产党方面是否参加政府。它首先取决于政府将采取什么政策。只要政府采取进步政策，共产党就支持它，即使共产党并不参加政府。这种态度丝毫不减弱共产党有权利在必要时对它所支持的政府进行批评，就像在韦洛坡内阁和阿里—阿里芬内阁时期那样。
    文告说，印度尼西亚全体人民——不管宗教、民族和社会地位的不同——都希望有更加美好的印度尼西亚，人民更加团结，各种权利有更好的保障。印度尼西亚共产党的文告最后召号印度尼西亚全体人民团结一切力量来表达他们的意见、情绪和愿望。
