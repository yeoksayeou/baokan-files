Xinhua News Agency Report:

More than 100,000 primary school teachers and some middle school teachers in Hunan Province are participating in rural literacy work. Many primary school teachers have drawn up plans to assist in eliminating illiteracy. In addition to helping nearby farmers learn to read in their spare time, they also help local areas compile literacy textbooks for farmers and train local peasant spare-time school teachers. Teachers at Jinpen Mountain Complete Primary School in Liling County opened a training class for teachers of people-run schools, training more than 50 teachers of people-run schools in five nearby townships. Seven language teachers at the No. 2 Junior Middle School in Yuanling County helped the No. 2 Agricultural Production Cooperative of Baiping Township, four li away from the school, to open a people-run school, taking turns to help the co-op members study culture for four evenings a week.

    湖南大批教师参加农村扫盲工作
    湖南省有10万多名小学教师和部分中学教师参加农村扫除文盲工作。许多小学教师订出了协助扫除文盲的计划。他们除了利用业余时间帮助附近农民识字外，还帮助当地编写农民识字课本，培养当地农民业余学校教师。醴陵县金盆山完全小学教师开办了一所民校教师进修班，培养了附近五个乡的民校教师50多人。沅陵县第二初级中学七个语文教员，帮助离校四里远的白坪乡第二农业生产合作社开办了一所民校，每周用四个晚上的时间，轮流帮助社员学习文化。
