Xinhua News Agency, 19th: Chinese steelworkers have set 15 new production records in the first 10 days of the new year. From January 1st to 10th, steelmaking workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's iron smelting plant set a record for the plant's highest daily output six times in a row. The daily output record set on the 9th was more than 300 tons of pig iron higher than the previous highest daily output record set in December 1955. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant set three new steelmaking records consecutively from January 1st to 10th. In one instance, Open Hearth Furnace No. 1 produced a furnace of steel in only 3 hours and 54 minutes, shortening the plant's previous record by 10 minutes. In addition, steelmaking workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's steelmaking plant, Daye Steel Plant, Tianjin Steel Plant, and other plants have all set one or more new steelmaking records in the first 10 days of this year.

Due to the continuous emergence of new production records, the production level of these factories has increased significantly. The average daily output of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's iron smelting plant from January 1st to 10th was more than 500 tons of pig iron higher than the average daily output in December of last year. In the first ten days of January this year, the Tianjin Steel Plant completed or exceeded its daily output plan every day.

The emergence of so many new records in the first ten days of January is unprecedented in previous years. This is a vivid demonstration of the broad masses of workers using practical actions to strive for the early completion of the Five-Year Plan.

    钢铁工人连续创造生产新纪录
    据新华社19日讯　中国钢铁工人在新年的头10天内创造了15次生产新纪录。鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂炼铁工人从1日到10日，连续创造了6次全厂日产量最高纪录。其中9日创造的日产量纪录，比1955年12月创造的日产量最高纪录还多300多吨生铁。太原钢铁厂1日到10日连续出现了3次炼钢新纪录，其中一号平炉有一炉钢只炼了3小时54分钟，比这个厂开厂以来的最高纪录缩短了10分钟。此外，鞍钢炼钢厂、大冶钢厂、天津钢厂等厂的炼钢工人，今年前10天里都创造了一次或多次炼钢新纪录。
    由于连续出现新的生产纪录，这些工厂的生产水平显著地提高了。鞍钢炼铁厂1日到10日的平均日产量比去年12月份的平均日产量多了500多吨生铁。天津钢厂在今年1月上旬，每天都完成或超额完成了日产量计划。
    这些工厂1月上旬出现这样多的新纪录，是历年来所没有的。这是广大职工用实际行动争取提前完成五年计划的一种生动的表现。
