The Chaoyang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xin Hailian City, Jiangsu Province, with over 500 households, previously only earned enough from its fields to sustain three months of grain consumption. After the cooperative developed multiple economies such as horticulture, flowers and fruits, pig raising, and iron, wood, and stone work, its income gradually increased. In 1953, sideline income, in addition to agricultural income, was more than 26,000 yuan, and in 1955 it increased to more than 77,000 yuan. On average, each household could receive 140 yuan from sideline occupations, which is equivalent to an increase in income from five or six mu of land per household. Due to the increase in labor income, the interest of cooperative members in land dividends has diminished. After the autumn of 1955, the cooperative members voluntarily leveled more than 500 field ridges and requested to establish an advanced cooperative. The Xiji Agricultural Cooperative in Yancheng County has little land and abundant labor. Before the development of multiple economies, there were more than 100 surplus laborers who could not be employed. In the past two years, the cooperative has dispatched 77 laborers to engage in sheep raising, duck raising, fish farming, pig feeding, iron and woodworking, melon and vegetable cultivation, flour milling, etc., increasing the number of workdays for each laborer in the cooperative from an average of 60 workdays per person per year before joining the cooperative to more than 120 workdays. All 18 widowed, orphaned, and impoverished households in the cooperative have found suitable work in sideline occupations.
    These two examples illustrate that the development of multiple economies plays a very important role in increasing the production of cooperatives and increasing the income of various members within the cooperative. Moreover, by developing multiple economies as early as possible based on feasibility, agricultural cooperatives can increase production and transition to advanced cooperatives more quickly. Not long ago, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party inspected the multiple operations of some older cooperatives and requested that older cooperatives in various regions actively learn from the experiences of cooperatives such as Chaoyang and Xiji, and more broadly develop multiple economies, striving to develop production in multiples and leaps and bounds, laying the foundation for piloting advanced cooperatives.

    应该发展多种经济
    江苏省新海连市有一个五百多户的朝阳农业生产合作社，过去田里的收入只够维持三个月的吃粮。社内发展了园艺、花果、养猪、铁木石工多种经济后，收入逐步增加。1953年除农业收入外，副业收入26，000多元，1955年更增加到77，000多元。平均每户从副业中可以分到140元，等于每户增加了五、六亩田的收入。由于劳动收益的增加，社员对于土地分红的兴趣已经不大。1955年秋后，社员们已自动平毁了五百多条田埂，要求办高级社。盐城县西季农业合作社土地少、劳力多，在没有发展多种经济以前，有一百多个剩余劳力无法使用。最近两年这个社派了77个劳力去经营养羊、养鸭、养鱼、喂猪、铁木工、种瓜菜、磨粉等，使全社每个劳力的工作日，由入社前每人每年平均做60个工，增加到120个工以上。社内18个孤寡困难户都在副业中找到了适当的工作。
    这两个例子说明，发展多种经济，对增加合作社的生产，增加社内各种成员的收入有很重要的作用。而且按照可能及早地发展多种经济，农业合作社还可以更快地提高生产和过渡到高级社。不久以前，中共江苏省委检查了一些老社多种经营的情况，要求各地老社，要积极学习朝阳、西季等社的经验，更广泛地发展多种经济，争取成倍地、跃进式地发展生产，为试办高级社打下基础。
