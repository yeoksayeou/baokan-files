    Research and Promote Good Farming Practices Among the Masses
    Shang Kai
    In the northwest corner of Xizhang Village in Jieyu County, Shanxi, there used to be a thousand mu of low-lying alkaline land. Before the spring of 1955, the masses there believed: "Farming alkaline land is not worthwhile. It takes a lot of work, and it's hard to get seedlings to grow." As a result, this land was left barren for many years. However, in 1955, 305 mu of this low-lying alkaline land yielded 51 jin of ginned cotton per mu. How did this happen?
    In the spring of 1955, Xizhang Village had already been collectivized. The Party branch, in accordance with the county party committee's call to "tap production potential," proposed improving the alkaline land when formulating the cooperative's production increase plan. Although this proposal was supported by the majority, it was also resisted by the conservative thinking of some people. They lacked confidence in "improving alkaline land," and some even thought it might be a "waste of seeds and labor." After studying the ideological situation of the cooperative members, the branch believed that the key to breaking the cooperative members' conservative thinking was to propose concrete methods for improving the alkaline land. The branch, in conjunction with the cooperative's management committee, carefully studied and surveyed the alkaline land and interviewed cooperative members with experience in improving alkaline land. Then, they held a forum on improving alkaline land, and a solution was quickly found. First, cooperative member Yan Yinhu introduced his experience in improving alkaline land by spreading sand. His four and a half mu of land, after being covered with sand, produced 45 jin of ginned cotton per mu. Then, cooperative member Wei Jicheng introduced his experience of both spreading sand and digging ditches for drainage, because if only sand is spread, the alkaline water will still rise over time. Later, some people proposed using more organic fertilizer to increase soil temperature to ensure better cotton growth. After discussion at the forum, three specific methods for improving alkaline land were finally determined: covering alkali with sand, digging ditches for drainage, and applying more organic fertilizer.
    Then, a general meeting of cooperative members was convened. Using the vivid facts of Yan Yinhu, Wei Jicheng, and others who had successfully improved alkaline land, the conservative thinking of some cooperative members was criticized, and everyone's confidence in improving alkaline land was increased. The next day, male and female cooperative members went out together, some digging ditches, some hauling sand, and a heated labor competition was launched. The original time allotted for digging ditches was 10 days, but it was completed in 7 days. The original time allotted for hauling sand was 15 days, but it was completed in 10 days, and 350,000 jin of composted corn stalks were delivered to the 305 mu of land, ensuring the timely sowing of cotton. Later, the branch also led the cooperative to strengthen field management of the cotton fields. After the autumn harvest, these 305 mu of cotton fields averaged 51 jin of ginned cotton per mu.
    This fact illustrates that in carrying out agricultural technological reform, the role of the rural Party branch is very important. As long as the rural Party branch actively leads and consults with the masses, the masses will come up with many good farming experiences, and these farming experiences will be easily accepted and adopted by the broad masses.

    研究和推广群众中的优良耕作经验
    商恺
    在山西解虞县席张村的西北头，曾经有一片千亩大的低洼碱地，1955年春天以前，那里的群众还认为：“种碱地，不合算，费工多，捉苗难”，因而这块土地就被长年荒废着。可是，1955年在这块低洼碱地上却有305亩地每亩收了皮棉51斤。这是怎么回事呢？
    1955年春天，席张村已经合作化了，党支部根据县委提出的“挖掘生产潜力”的号召，在制定合作社的增产计划的时候，提出了改良碱地的意见。这个意见虽然得到多数人的拥护，可是也受到部分人保守思想的抵抗，他们对“改良碱地”缺乏信心，有人甚至认为可能是“白搭籽，白费工”。支部在研究了社员们的思想情况之后，认为要打破社员的保守思想，关键在于提出改良碱地的具体办法。支部就协同社务委员会对碱地作了仔细的研究勘察，又对改良碱地有经验的社员作了访问，然后召开了改良碱地的座谈会，办法立刻找出来了。首先，由社员阎寅虎介绍了用铺沙办法改良碱地的经验，他的四亩半土地铺沙以后种的棉花每亩能产45斤皮棉。接着由社员卫计成介绍了自己既铺沙子，又挖壕排水的经验，因为光铺沙子，日子一长，碱水仍会上升。以后，还有人提出采用多施有机质肥料增加地温的办法保证棉花更好地生长。经过座谈会的讨论，最后确定了改良碱地的三条具体办法，即铺沙盖碱，挖壕排水和多施有机质肥料。
    接着就召开了社员大会，用阎寅虎、卫计成等改良碱地得到成功的活生生的事实，批判了部分社员的保守思想，提高了大家改良碱地的信心。第二天，男女社员就一齐出动，挖壕的挖壕，拉沙的拉沙，展开了热烈的劳动竞赛。挖壕的时间原定10天，结果7天就完成了；拉沙的时间原定15天，结果10天就完成了，并且把沤成肥料的35万斤玉茭秆送到305亩地里，保证了棉花的及时下种。以后，支部又领导合作社加强了棉田的田间管理。秋收以后，这305亩棉田平均每亩摘皮棉51斤。
    这个事实说明了，在进行农业技术改革中，乡村党支部的作用是很大的。只要乡村党支部积极领导，同群众商量，群众是会提出不少好的耕作经验的，而且这些耕作经验又容易被广大群众接受和采用。
