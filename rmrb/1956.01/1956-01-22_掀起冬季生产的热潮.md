To the Editor:

Our Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Penglai Township, Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, was established in the spring of 1953. In the autumn of 1955, it was expanded into a large cooperative of 170 households and decided to transform into an advanced cooperative. The production enthusiasm of the members is unprecedentedly high. With the help of the county party committee and the township party branch, the cooperative's management committee revised the production plan: the yield of broad beans in the off-season should increase by 15% compared to the usual yield; wheat should increase by 13% compared to last year; the yield of rice in the main season is required to reach 906 jin per mu; the planting area of flue-cured tobacco should be expanded from 25 mu to 50 mu, the yield per unit area should be increased by 80%, and the quality should be improved by one grade; reduce the area of dryland low-yield crops by half and plant high-yield crops such as potatoes. Undertake sideline occupations such as brick and tile burning, oil extraction, flour milling, pig raising, fish farming, silkworm raising, straw mat making, and horse-drawn carriage transportation. In addition, it is also planned to build four pig sties, two cattle sheds, and five drying rooms, purchase five horse-drawn carriages, and expand two horse-drawn carriage roads.

After this production plan was approved, the cooperative immediately launched a winter production upsurge. An average of 95% of the labor force participates in production every day. By the end of the year, wheat had been hoed for the first time and began to be hoed for the second time; in order to eliminate rice borers, 5,810 jin of rice stubble have been pulled out; in terms of manure accumulation, 18,481 loads of sod and ditch mud have been shoveled and carried, 3,772 loads of stable manure have been accumulated, and 6 new large manure ponds have been dug. Sideline production such as kiln burning, oil production, and vermicelli making has also been started. In addition, 3 pig sties have been built, and 3 horses and 71 pigs have been purchased.

    掀起冬季生产的热潮编辑同志：
    我们云南省宜良县蓬莱乡前进农业生产合作社，是1953年春天建立的，1955年秋天已经扩建为170户的大社，并且决定转成高级社。社员们生产情绪空前高涨。社务委员会在县委和乡党支部的帮助下，修订了生产计划：小春蚕豆要比常年产量增产15％；小麦要比去年增产13％；大春稻谷要求每亩产量达到906斤；烤烟的种植面积要从25亩扩大为50亩，单位面积产量要提高80％，质量要提高一级；缩小旱地低产作物面积一半，种植薯类等高产作物。要开展烧砖瓦、榨油、磨粉、养猪、养鱼、养蚕、打草席、马车运输等副业。另外还准备修建猪厩四间、牛厩二间、烤房五间，购置马车五辆，扩修两条马车路。
    这个生产计划通过以后，社里马上掀起了冬季生产的热潮，平均每天有95％的劳动力参加生产。到年底小麦已锄完头道，开始锄第二道；为了消灭螟虫，已经拔了稻桩5，810斤；在积肥方面，已经铲草皮、抬沟泥18，481挑，积厩肥3，772挑，新挖大粪塘6个。烧窑、打油、制粉丝等副业生产也已经搞起来。另外还建成了猪厩3间，买了马3匹、猪71头。
