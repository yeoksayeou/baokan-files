　　Overcoming Conservative Thinking and Increasing This Year's Production Targets
　　Wu Jin, Head of the Huqiao First Agricultural Production Cooperative, Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province
　　Currently, farmers across the country are jubilantly celebrating the New Year in the boiling new high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement. I am Wu Jin, the head of the Huqiao First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province. Like other farmers, our cooperative members are very happy in the New Year. I will not talk about anything else, but only about how our cooperative is overcoming conservative thinking and raising production targets to welcome the New Year—1956.
　　Our cooperative is a new cooperative established on September 1, 1955. Not long after its organization, it made considerable achievements in production. During the autumn sowing, it did not rain for more than 30 days. We watered the fields to plant wheat, and the autumn sowing was completed ten days earlier than in previous years. In the past, most fields were only plowed once before planting wheat, and the furrows were not maintained. This time, the fields in the cooperative were generally plowed three times before planting wheat, and the furrows were dug deeply. The entire cooperative has completed its plan to collect river mud and replace wall soil, and the members have also raised 17 pigs to accumulate fertilizer. Seeing these things, I was secretly pleased, thinking that with good cultivation and no problem with fertilizer, as long as the electric irrigation project is successfully constructed (we are currently building an electric irrigation project here), increased production would be guaranteed. My blind optimism had a great influence on the members, and everyone wanted to rest for a couple of days. In order to prepare for the 1956 production, the Party branch promptly pointed out our complacency and conservative thinking, helped us convene the cooperative management committee, summarized the achievements since the establishment of the cooperative, studied Chairman Mao's instructions, and criticized blind complacency and the idea of taking a break.
　　As everyone's thinking improved, their eyes brightened, and they saw many problems in the cooperative. The original production plan also seemed somewhat conservative. For example, after specific calculations, it was found that the plan to apply fertilizer twice to 40% of the fields had failed, and even applying fertilizer once was still short by 20 mu. Everyone was shocked and realized that if they did not study and examine, even the conservative plan could not be achieved. Therefore, they practically revised the original production plan. The unit area yield of wheat in 1956 was increased from the original plan of 180 jin to 200 jin, barley from 200 jin to 250 jin, Yuan wheat from 160 jin to 180 jin, and rice from 472 jin to 600 jin. In this way, the total output of rice and wheat in the whole year can reach 800 jin. Then, everyone discussed specific measures to increase production around this goal, especially the winter production content: First, vigorously accumulate fertilizer. The number of ponds from which pond mud is collected has increased from two to six; replace two more walls of soil; mobilize semi-able-bodied laborers to pick up dog manure. In this way, plus human and pig manure, all wheat can be fertilized twice. Second, mobilize cooperative members to build electric irrigation waterways to ensure that 60 mu of dry land will be converted into paddy fields in 1956. Third, strengthen field management of summer crops, dig furrows and manage ditches in winter to ensure that the fields are dry after rain; universally weed wheat fields in spring; and quickly eliminate pests when they are found. Fourth, all autumn rice crops should use improved varieties such as Zhongnong No. 4 and Shengli Xian, cultivate strong seedlings, appropriately thin the planting, change the past rough cultivation methods, and universally harrow once. In order to ensure that rice receives sufficient fertilizer, in addition to accumulating more pig and human manure and planting more green manure Astragalus sinicus, it is also necessary to mobilize cooperative members to chop 30,000 jin of green grass and carry 240 dan of gutter water from Yangzhou city. Mobilize cooperative members to vigorously raise pigs, reaching two pigs per household by autumn; and ensure that cow dung is not burned for cooking, but is used entirely as fertilizer. The entire cooperative will cultivate ten mu of high-yield fields with a yield of 1,000 jin in 1956, striving to reach a yield of 1,100 jin per mu. After this production target is reached, the total output in 1956 can reach 118,320 jin. After deducting public grain, retaining seeds, and selling surplus grain, each person can obtain an average of 800 jin of grain.
　　After the cooperative's production plan was approved at the members' meeting, every member was all smiles. At this time, the management committee also seized the opportunity to handle specific issues related to production, such as waterwheels, plows, and fertilizer, and everyone was highly motivated to produce. In order to ensure increased production in 1956, the entire cooperative is currently intensively carrying out a winter fertilizer accumulation campaign in the New Year.

　　克服保守思想，提高今年增产指标
    江苏省江都县胡桥第一农业生产合作社社长　吴金
　　现在，全国农民都在沸腾一样的农业合作化运动的新高潮里欢欣鼓舞过新年。我是江苏省江都县胡桥第一农业生产合作社的社长，在新年里我们社的社员和别的农民一样非常高兴，我现在别的不说，单说我们社怎样克服保守思想，提高增产指标来迎接新的一年——1956年。　　我们社是1955年9月1日成立的新社。组织起来不久，生产上就做出了不少成绩。秋种的时候，有30多天没有下雨，我们浇水种麦，秋种比往年提早十天就完成了。过去大部分田只耕一遍就种麦，墒沟也不理，这回社里的田普遍耕了三遍才种麦，条条墒沟挖得深深的。全社挑河泥，换墙土已经完成计划，社员们又养了17条猪来积肥。我看到这些，心里暗暗高兴，认为耕作得好，肥料又不成问题，只要等电力灌溉工程建设成功（我们这里正在修电力灌溉工程），增产就保险了。我的这种盲目乐观情绪，对社员们影响很大，大家都想休息两天。为了作好1956年的生产准备工作，这时，党支部及时指出我们的自满保守思想，帮助我们召开社管理委员会，总结建社以来的成绩，学习了毛主席的指示，批判了盲目自满和歇劲思想。
    大家思想一提高，眼睛就亮了，看到社里有很多问题，原订增产计划也有些保守。比如，经过具体计算，发现40％的田施二遍肥的计划落空了，连施一遍都还缺20亩肥。大家都大吃一惊，认识到如果不学习不检查，就是保守的计划也不能达到，因此，切实修订了原来的生产计划。1956年小麦单位面积产量由原计划180斤增订为二百斤，大麦由二百斤增为250斤，元麦由160斤增为180斤，稻子由472斤增为六百斤。这样，全年稻麦两季产量可达到八百斤，接着，大家又围绕这个目标，讨论了具体增产措施，特别是冬季生产内容：一、大力积肥。挑塘泥从两个塘增加到六个；再换二爿墙土；发动半劳力拾狗粪。这样，加上人粪、猪粪，麦子全部可施到二遍肥料。二、发动社员做电力灌溉水路，保证1956年60亩旱田改为水稻田。三、加强夏熟作物田间管理，冬季挖墒理沟，做到雨过田干；春天麦田普遍锄草；发现虫害就迅速扑灭。四、秋熟作物稻子全部选用中农四号、胜利籼等良种，培育壮秧，适当匀植，改变过去粗糙耕作方法，并且普遍推耙一次。为了保证稻子施足够的肥料，除多积猪粪、人粪和多种绿肥黄花草外，还要发动社员铲青草三万斤，到扬州城里挑阴沟水240担。发动社员大力养猪，到秋天达到每家养两只；并做到牛粪不烧锅，全部用作肥料。全社在1956年培养十亩千斤高产田，争取每亩产量达到1，100斤。这个生产指标达到后，1956年总产量可达到118，320斤。除去公粮、留种子、卖余粮，每人平均可得八百斤粮食。
    社里的这个增产方案在社员大会上通过后，个个社员喜笑颜开。这时，管委会又抓紧处理了和生产有关的水车、耕牛、肥料等具体问题，大家生产劲头很高。为了保证1956年增产，全社在新年里正紧张地开展冬季积肥运动。
