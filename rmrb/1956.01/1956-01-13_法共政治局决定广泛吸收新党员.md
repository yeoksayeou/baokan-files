Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch. TASS, Paris, 11th dispatch: The Politburo of the French Communist Party has passed a resolution deciding to implement several measures for the broad absorption of new party members. The resolution emphasizes that the January 2nd National Assembly elections demonstrate the significant role the Communist Party and its organizations play in the struggle to implement policies that conform to the national interests of the French people. The resolution states that the activities of the French Communists have received a profound response among the working masses, as evidenced by the fact that 5,000 new party members joined the party in December 1955 alone.

The Politburo calls on all Communist Party members and party organizations to exert all their efforts to consolidate the glorious victory the party achieved in the January 2nd elections and to assist the party in absorbing into its ranks all men and women workers and working youth who agree with the proposals of the Communists and desire to change French policy.

    新华社12日讯  塔斯社巴黎11日讯：法国共产党政治局通过了决议，决定实行广泛吸收新党员的若干措施。决议着重指出，1月2日国民议会的选举说明，共产党和它的组织在争取实行符合法国人民民族利益的政策的斗争中，起着重大的作用。决议说，法国共产党人的活动在劳动人民群众中得到深刻的反应，仅在1955年12月就有五千名新党员入党这个事实就是证明。
    政治局号召全体共产党员和党的组织竭尽全力巩固党在1月2日选举中取得的光辉的胜利，并且协助党把同意共产党人的主张和渴望改变法国政策的所有男女劳动人民和劳动青年吸收到党的队伍里来。
