　　Guo Shuangbao Feeds Livestock Fat and Strong
　　Li Guangping

　　In the tenth month of the lunar calendar in the summer of 1954, the ground was covered with a thick layer of snow. In the Guo Erfu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Huanghua Township, Lin County, Henan Province, most of the land had not yet been plowed. The ten or so livestock tied in the stable were all skin and bones. Everyone was very anxious: how could they carry out winter plowing with such weak livestock? However, the then-caretakers Guo Yijin and Sang Shuangzi spent their days in the stable playing the huqin and chess, not taking the feeding of livestock seriously. The original owners of the livestock were very sad to see them so thin and even proposed withdrawing from the cooperative. Seeing the situation was not good, the two caretakers quit their jobs at the year-end settlement.

　　With the caretakers gone, those members who had some feeding skills were afraid to take on this mess. Just at this time, Guo Shuangbao returned from the army. Some members then had the idea of asking him. But some were afraid that Shuangbao couldn't handle it; besides, the Spring Festival was approaching, and Shuangbao hadn't been home for seven years, so he should have a good time celebrating the festival, and shouldn't be busy as soon as he came back; but the livestock were waiting to be fed, so the Party branch committee members and cooperative cadres tried to discuss it with Shuangbao. To everyone's surprise, Shuangbao agreed immediately. He said, "I am a Communist Party member, and I will participate in the agricultural production cooperative after demobilization, and I must listen to the Party and the cooperative's assignments."

　　Difficulties were presented to him one by one. The former caretakers did not sleep in the stable, the house was a mess, the walls were full of cobwebs, and the kang [brick bed] had collapsed. It took him a lot of effort to clean it up before he settled down. At night, three particularly weak donkeys just wanted to lie down, and once they lay down, they couldn't stand up, risking being trampled to death by other livestock. So, Shuangbao fed the livestock in the first half of the night and pulled up the thin donkeys in the second half of the night, three or four times a night. On New Year's Eve, while others were eating dumplings, he was still dealing with a circle of thin livestock.

　　Time passed day by day, but the livestock didn't seem to improve much. One day, Shuangbao went to consult someone experienced in raising livestock. From the conversation, he learned that when the livestock were raised separately in each household, they had to drink some leftover rice water every day, which both fattened them and saved feed. The next day, he carried two buckets and went to collect leftover rice water from each household. But after going to all the houses, he collected very little rice water. Because some households wanted to use the rice water to feed chickens or compost fertilizer. Shuangbao patiently carried out propaganda and mobilization, explaining that if the livestock were fattened, they could do more work, which would benefit everyone. After that, the members automatically brought out the rice water.

　　With leftover rice water to drink, and proper feeding of grass and fodder, the thin livestock gradually became fat.

　　Summer came, and the livestock had no grass to eat. It was also difficult to buy grass. Shuangbao then went up the mountain to graze the livestock. During the grazing period, the cooperative's method of using livestock was to leave those that were used in the morning, and then send them up the mountain at noon to drive back the livestock that would be used in the afternoon. In this way, both grass and fodder were saved, and the livestock were fed very well.

　　Once the busy farming season arrived, the livestock had more work to do, and Shuangbao took more care in feeding them.

　　Shuangbao often said: "Livestock are the public property of the cooperative, and are currently the main driving force in production. Whether the livestock are fed well or badly is related to the production and life of the entire cooperative." Therefore, he was very particular about feeding techniques. In the spring, he saw that some livestock were thin and some were fat, so he implemented a classified feeding method, separating the large livestock, small livestock, fast eaters, and slow eaters into different troughs to feed. In this way, the livestock did not suffer from eating grass and fodder. Before chopping grass each time, he had to dry the grass in the sun, first to make it easier to chop, and second to chop it shorter. Every time he added grass, he added very little, and added more after the livestock finished eating. In order to make the livestock eat more grass, he added grain grass once and then green grass or sweet potato seedlings, so that the livestock wanted to eat more and more. Because he did a good job in feeding, each livestock only consumed half a jin of fodder per day, but the livestock were fat, smooth-haired, and energetic.

　　Shuangbao also paid attention to the use of livestock. Once, he saw a small gray mule pulling a large millstone, sweating all over. Later, when someone came to lead the livestock for use, he first asked whether it was pulling a large millstone or a small millstone. If it was a large millstone, he would let them lead away the large livestock; if it was a small millstone, he would lead away the small livestock.

　　The cooperative stipulates that in addition to feeding the livestock well, the caretakers are also responsible for the work of bedding the pens, watering the pens, and emptying the pens, and must accumulate 120 cartloads of fertilizer per month. Even so, the entire cooperative still lacked two hundred cartloads of fertilizer throughout the year. In the spring of last year, Shuangbao formulated a plan to make up for the annual shortage of fertilizer by frequently emptying the pens, frequently bedding the pens, and frequently taking out the manure. In less than a year, the fertilizer he accumulated had exceeded the quota by more than three hundred cartloads, ensuring the needs of the agricultural production cooperative. At the autumn summary meeting, Shuangbao was selected as the caretaker to attend the county-wide model meeting; the cooperative also awarded him 45 workdays.

　　Now, Shuangbao recalls the guarantee he made to his superiors and comrades when he left the army and says, "I have already begun to realize my promise." But he is not satisfied with this, and he will work harder to make more contributions in the agricultural cooperativization movement.

　　郭双保把牲口喂得又肥又壮
    李广平
    1954年夏历10月间，满地已经盖上了厚厚的一层雪。河南省林县黄华乡郭二付农业生产合作社里，绝大部分土地还没有耕过。拴在马棚里的大小十头牲口，一个个都瘦得皮包骨头。大家非常着急：牲口这样瘦弱，怎么进行冬耕呢？可是当时的饲养员郭易金和桑双仔却整天在马棚里拉胡琴，走象棋，把喂养牲口不当回事。牲口的原来的主人看见牲口瘦成这样，心里很难过，甚至提出退社的要求。两个饲养员看形势不好，趁年终结算的时候，便辞职不干了。
    饲养员不干了，社员中间有点饲养技术的人，又都怕接这个烂摊子。正在这个时候，郭双保从部队复员回来了。当时有些社员就把主意打在他的身上。但是也有人怕双保吃不消；再说，春节快到了，双保七年没在家，应该痛痛快快过个节，不能让他一回来就忙起来；可是牲口要等着人去喂，党支部委员和社干部便试着去和双保商量。事情出乎人们的预料，双保一口就答应了。他说：“我是共产党员，复员回来参加农业生产合作社，一定听从党和社的分配。”
    困难一个个摆在他的面前。前任饲养员不在马棚睡觉，房子里不像样子，墙上满是蜘蛛网，炕也倒塌了。他用了很大的力气收拾了一番，才安顿下来。一到晚上，三头特别瘦弱的驴光想卧倒，一卧倒就站不起来，有被别的牲口踩死的危险。于是，双保前半夜喂牲口，后半夜揪瘦驴，一夜要揪三四次。大年夜，别人正在吃饺子的时候，他仍然和一圈瘦牲口打交道。
    时间一天天地过去了，可是牲口还不见有多大起色。一天，双保去请教养牲口有经验的人。从交谈中他了解到，牲口原先在各户分养的时候，每天都要喝些剩饭水，既上膘，又省料。第二天他就担起两只桶，到各户去收罗剩饭水。可是走遍了各家，收来的饭水很少。因为有些户要把饭水喂鸡、沤粪。双保就耐心地进行宣传动员，说明牲口养肥了能多做活，对大家都有利。这以后，社员们都自动把饭水拿了出来。
    牲口有了剩饭水喝，加上草料喂得合适，瘦牲口渐渐都胖起来了。
    夏天来了，牲口没有草吃。买草又有困难。双保便上山放牧牲口。在放牧期间，社里用牲口的办法是，上午使那个就把那个留下，到了晌午再送上山把下午要使的牲口赶回来。这样，既省了草料，又把牲口喂得很肥。
    一到农忙，牲口的活多了，双保喂牲口也就更用心了。
    双保常说：“牲口是合作社的公共财产，目前在生产上又是主要动力。牲口喂好喂坏，关系全社的生产和生活。”因此他在喂养技术上很讲究。春天他看到牲口有瘦有肥，就实行了分类喂养办法，把大牲口、小牲口、吃得快的、吃得慢的分开槽来喂。这样牲口吃草吃料就都不吃亏了。每次铡草以前，他都要把草晒干，一来好铡，二来铡得短。每次添草都添得很少，等牲口吃完了再添。为了使牲口多吃草，喂的时候，添一次谷草再添一次青草或者甘薯秧，使牲口越吃越想吃。由于他饲养工作做得好，每天每头牲口只合半斤料，牲口却喂得膘肥、毛顺、精神好。
    双保也很注意对牲口的使用。有一次，他看到小灰骡拉大碾，累得浑身是汗。以后有人来牵牲口去用，他就先问拉的是大碾还是小碾。如果是大碾，就让牵走大牲口；是小碾，就牵走小牲口。
    社内规定：饲养员除要喂好牲口以外，还兼管垫圈、泼圈和倒圈的工作，每月得积肥120车。就这样，全社全年还缺二百车粪肥。在去年春天，双保就订出了计划，决定用勤倒圈、勤垫圈、勤出圈的办法，来补足全年缺的肥料。不到一年时间，他积的肥料就已经超额三百多车，保证了农业生产合作社的需要。在秋季总结大会上，双保被选为出席全县模范大会的饲养员；社内并且奖给他45个劳动日。
    现在，双保回忆起他离开部队向首长和同志们所作的保证的时候说：“我已经开始实现了我的诺言。”但是他并没有因此满足，他将更加努力，在农业合作化运动中作出更多的贡献。
