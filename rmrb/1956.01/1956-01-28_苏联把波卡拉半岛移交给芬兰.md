Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 26th (TASS dispatch): On January 26th, the signing ceremony of the final protocol on the Soviet Union's transfer of the Porkkala Peninsula area and the properties in this area to Finland was held at the Soviet Embassy in Finland in Helsinki.

At the same time, a joint Soviet-Finnish communiqué was adopted.

The communiqué stated that, according to the final protocol, the Soviet Union returned the Porkkala Peninsula area it had leased to Finland and transferred its properties in this area to the Finnish government free of charge. The properties transferred by the Soviet Union included 675 residential, industrial, and other buildings, a railway branch line, 41 kilometers of main and branch roads, nine wharves, wharf equipment, a power station building, an oil depot with a capacity of 1,700 tons, and 145.7 kilometers of high-voltage power lines.

Representing the Soviet Union in signing the final protocol were First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Pervukhin, and Soviet Ambassador to Finland, Lebedev.

Representing Finland were Finnish Prime Minister Kekkonen and Foreign Minister Virolainen.

President Paasikivi of the Republic of Finland attended the signing ceremony.

After the signing of the protocol, Pervukhin and Kekkonen delivered speeches.

Pervukhin pointed out that the Soviet Union's decision to return the Porkkala Peninsula area was a major measure aimed at further easing international tensions. This decision vividly confirms that the Soviet Union consistently pursues a peaceful foreign policy. The Soviet Union now has no military bases on the territory of other countries. The Soviet government believes that the maintenance of military bases by some countries on the territory of other countries cannot but hinder the establishment of truly solid peaceful cooperation among the peoples of all countries based on mutual trust. Pervukhin also said that the friendly relations established between the Soviet Union and Finland not only conform to the national interests of our two peoples but also make a significant contribution to safeguarding the cause of peace in Europe.

Kekkonen said in his speech that the state document signed today signifies a particularly important achievement in the friendly policy between Finland and the Soviet Union. He expressed that the Finnish government will sincerely continue to consistently adhere to its pursued policy.

    苏联把波卡拉半岛移交给芬兰
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社赫尔辛基26日讯：1月26日在赫尔辛基的苏联驻芬兰大使馆举行了关于苏联将波卡拉半岛地区和这一地区上的财产移交给芬兰的最后议定书的签字仪式。
    同时还通过了苏联—芬兰联合公报。
    公报说，根据最后议定书，苏联把它所租借的波卡拉半岛地区交还芬兰并且把它在这一地区上的财产无偿地交给芬兰政府。苏联移交的财产中包括675所住宅、工业房屋和其他房屋、一条铁路支线、41公里长的公路干线和支线、九个码头、码头设备、一个发电站的大厦、容量1，700吨的油库和145.7公里的高压电线。
    代表苏联在最后议定书上签字的是苏联部长会议第一副主席别尔乌辛和苏联驻芬兰大使列别杰夫。
    代表芬兰签字的是芬兰总理吉科宁和外交部长维洛莱宁。
    芬兰共和国总统巴锡基维出席了签字仪式。
    议定书签字完毕后，别尔乌辛和吉科宁先后致词。
    别尔乌辛指出，苏联关于交还波卡拉半岛地区的决定是旨在进一步缓和国际紧张局势的重大措施。这个决定鲜明地证实苏联一贯执行着和平外交政策。苏联现在在其他国家领土上已经没有军事基地。苏联政府认为，一些国家在另一些国家领土上保有军事基地不能不阻碍各国人民之间建立起以互相信任为基础的真正巩固的和平合作。别尔乌辛还说，苏联和芬兰之间所建立的友好关系不仅符合我们两国人民的民族利益，而且是对维护欧洲和平事业的一个重大贡献。
    吉科宁在致词时说，目前签订的这个国家文件，意味着芬苏两国友好的政策获得了特别重要的成就。他表示，芬兰政府将真诚地继续一贯遵守它所奉行的政策。
