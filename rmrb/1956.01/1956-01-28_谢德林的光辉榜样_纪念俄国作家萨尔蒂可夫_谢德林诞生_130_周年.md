    Shedrin's Shining Example
    ——Commemorating the 130th Anniversary of the Birth of Russian Writer Saltykov-Shchedrin——
    Jiang Tianzuo
    The great Russian writer Saltykov-Shchedrin (1826-1889) inherited and developed Gogol's tradition, making a huge contribution to the Russian people's revolutionary struggle with his uniquely styled satirical literature, and leaving an immortal and precious legacy to the spiritual treasure house of all the world's people.

    The era in which Shedrin lived was precisely the era when the rule of the nobles and landlords of Tsarist Russia was collapsing, and capitalism was developing rapidly, revealing its ugly features more and more clearly. This era was also the eve of the Russian proletariat's formation, growth, and awakening, before stepping onto the political stage under the leadership of its Marxist party. Shedrin, like the great revolutionary democratic writers such as Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, and Dobrolyubov, who had a profound influence on him, stood at the forefront of the struggle of this era and became one of the pioneers of the proletarian revolution.

    In his youth, Shedrin established utopian socialist ideas, which were expressed in his early works ("Contradictions" in 1847 and "A Complicated Affair" in 1848) and ran through all his works. These initial works brought him the persecution of the Tsarist government, leading to his arrest in 1848 and exile for seven years. However, persecution only strengthened his will and sharpened his satirical weapons. In order to fight, he wrote many works throughout his life, including novels, essays, sketches, fables, dramas, and other forms. His last posthumous work was "The Old Days in Poshekhonye" (1887-1889), in which he continued to expose and satirize the ugliness of the landlord class with great artistic expression, appealing for the suffering peasants.

    Shedrin's realism broadly reflected the social life of the old Russian era, penetrating the core of reality and grasping the most fundamental contradictions. With satirical and pungent strokes, he vividly portrayed the ugly souls, ignorance, and animalistic mentality of nobles, landlords, generals, bureaucrats, and bourgeois figures. He bitterly criticized and ridiculed the reactionary forces, arousing the broad masses' hatred, contempt, and resistance towards them. He was filled with sympathy and warmth for the deceived and enslaved people, and full of confidence in the victory of their resistance. Because of this, Shedrin's works possessed great combat effectiveness and profound educational significance. Therefore, true great satirical literature cannot be confused with shallow and vulgar jokes, nor does it have anything in common with nihilistic and world-weary thoughts.

    Shedrin's great strength lies first and foremost in the fact that he started from lofty ideals. He not only deeply believed that the society of Tsarist Russia, full of sin and stupidity, was bound to perish, but also deeply believed that an ideal society, free from the oppression of the serf system and the exploitation of the bourgeoisie, eliminating poverty and ignorance, and characterized by equality and freedom, was bound to be realized. Although, due to the limitations of historical conditions, he could not see the specific path to realizing such an ideal society. To satirize ugliness venomously in order to defend the beautiful, Shedrin and Gogol were consistent on this point. Gogol portrayed the souls of vile and shameless people in order to express the image of honest people. Shedrin believed that in order for satire to become true satire and achieve its purpose, first, the reader must appreciate the ideal from which the creator of the satire departs; second, one must clearly recognize the target of one's satire. He believed that one should place beautiful ideals in the primary and important position on the basis of realism, and use this ideal to guide the in-depth understanding of the satirical object, thereby creating types that are more complete and representative than the popular ones. This creative method of his, as many Soviet critics have correctly pointed out, is a characteristic shared by the great revolutionary democratic writers of 19th-century Russia, and is also one of the historical sources of the method of socialist realism.

    Shedrin, standing at the forefront of the most advanced thought of his time, not only attacked and ridiculed the incompetence and shamelessness of those reactionary forces, but also exposed the hypocrisy and incompetence of those reformist demagogues. His many famous fables, such as "The Idealistic Carp," "The Eagle, Patron of Literature," and "The Rabbit Who Rejoices in Reasoning," vividly, appropriately, and forcefully exposed the incompetence of that hypocritical, empty philosophy in the face of the reactionary rulers, and its poisoning of the kind people. In "Life's Trifles," Shedrin's sharp point forcefully targeted the bourgeois's vulgar, boring, and extremely lifestyle, which completely lost the ideals and ambitions of life, and this lifestyle is precisely the soul of the "American way of life" that the ruling class of today's capitalist world spares no effort to encourage and promote in order to enslave people spiritually and to bind their minds. Shedrin held a firm and enthusiastic belief in the bright future of the Russian people. For example, in the short fable "Conscience Lost," he firmly placed his hope on the "child," and was convinced that after the child grew up, "conscience" would grow stronger and destroy and eliminate all the evils of the old world. But Shedrin not only placed his hopes on the future, he already saw positive factors in reality. This strengthened the power of his satire. This is why his works never produce any sense of emptiness and despair, but only increase confidence in the power of the people. He had a deep feeling for the heroic images of the positive characters of his time, for example, in "The Gentlemen of Tashkent," the story "They Are the Ones" features a brilliant image of a young revolutionary.

    Many of Shedrin's works not only had a great impact on the intellectual circles of the time, but also widely circulated among the people, making him one of the most widely read writers of his time and after his death, thus gradually combining with the struggle of the masses. The typical figures he exposed, the negative characters, gave people an unforgettable and profound impression, becoming lessons that have been passed down forever. For example, Yudushka in "The Golovlyov Family," Glupov in "The History of a Town," the Pompadours in "Pompadours," as well as "The Extremely Intelligent Roach" and "The Idealistic Carp," have gradually become like common nouns in the Russian language. Lenin, Stalin, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union gave high praise to Shedrin's contribution. Lenin and Stalin often cited Shedrin's literary images to educate everyone; the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union put forward the call to Soviet writers to learn from Gogol and Shedrin and to cultivate "Soviet Gogols and Shedrins."

    In the great cause of building socialism, our need for satirical literature will not be less than that of the Soviet Union. But we do not want just any kind of satire. Comrade Mao Zedong said long ago in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art:

    "Are we to abolish satire? No, satire is always necessary. But there are several kinds of satire: there is satire against the enemy, there is satire against allies, and there is satire against one's own ranks, and the attitudes are different in each case. We do not generally oppose satire, but the misuse of satire must be abolished."

    This principle is precisely the only correct principle that we should follow today in developing satirical literature. And learning from Shedrin's shining example is of great significance for us to implement this principle to strive to develop satirical literature and to fight to strike at the enemy and eliminate obstacles in the path of building socialism.

    谢德林的光辉榜样
    ——纪念俄国作家萨尔蒂可夫—谢德林诞生130周年——
    蒋天佐
    俄国伟大作家萨尔蒂可夫—谢德林（1826—1889）继承和发展了果戈理的传统，用他的具有独特风格的讽刺文学对俄国人民的革命斗争作出了巨大的贡献，并且给全世界人民的精神宝库留下了不朽的珍贵财产。
    谢德林所处的时代正是沙皇俄国的贵族、地主的统治日趋崩溃，资本主义日益发展而资本主义的丑恶面目也日益暴露的时代。这个时代也就是俄国无产阶级形成、壮大和觉醒起来之后在自己的马克思主义的政党领导之下走上政治舞台的前夕。谢德林正如对他有深刻影响的别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基和杜勃罗留波夫等伟大的革命民主主义作家一样，走在这个时代的斗争的最前列，并且成为无产阶级革命时代的先驱者之一。
    谢德林在青年时代就确立了空想的社会主义的思想，这种思想在他的初期的作品（1847年的“矛盾”和1848年的“一件错综复杂的事”）里面就有了表现，而且贯彻在他所有的作品中间。他这些最初的作品就给他带来了沙皇政府的迫害，使他在1848年被捕并且被流放了七年。但是迫害只是更加坚定了他的意志，并且使他的讽刺的武器更加锐利。他为了战斗，一生写了许多作品，包括小说、散文、速写、寓言故事、戏剧等多种形式。他的最后的遗著是“波舍洪旧话”（1887—1889），他在这里面继续用极大的艺术表现力暴露和讽刺地主阶级的丑恶，为苦难中的农民呼吁。
    谢德林的现实主义极其广阔地反映了旧俄时代社会生活的面貌，而且突进了现实的核心，抓住了最根本的矛盾。他用讽刺的、辛辣的笔法生动地刻画了贵族、地主、将军、官僚、资产阶级人物的丑恶的灵魂和他们的愚笨无知和动物般的精神状态。他痛切地抨击和嘲笑了反动势力，激起广大人民对他们的仇恨、鄙视和反抗。对于被欺骗和奴役的人民充满了同情和温暖，而且对于他们的反抗的胜利充满了信心。正因为如此，谢德林的作品才具有了巨大的战斗力和深刻的教育作用。所以，真正的伟大的讽刺文学不仅不能和那种浅薄的、庸俗的笑料混为一谈，而且也和那种虚无主义的厌世思想毫无共同之点。
    谢德林的伟大的力量首先在于他是从崇高的理想出发。他不仅深信沙皇俄国那个充满了罪恶和愚笨的社会必然灭亡，而且深信一个理想的、既没有农奴制度的压迫也没有资产阶级的剥削的、消灭了贫穷和愚昧的、平等自由的社会必然要实现。虽然他由于历史条件的限制，还不能够看到实现这样的理想社会的具体的道路。为了维护美好的东西而毒辣地嘲讽丑恶的东西，在这一点上谢德林和果戈理是一致的。果戈理刻画卑鄙无耻的人的灵魂是为了表现正直的人的形象。谢德林认为：要使讽刺成为真正的讽刺，并且达到自己的目的，第一，必须使读者体会到讽刺的创造者所从而出发的理想；第二，必须十分明确地认清自己的讽刺锋芒所指的对象。他认为应该在现实主义的基础上面把美好的理想放在第一义的重要地位，并且根据这个理想来指导对于讽刺对象的深入的认识，从而创造出比流行的东西更完全、更有代表性的典型来。他这种创作方法，正如许多苏联的批评家所正确地指出，正是俄国19世纪的革命民主主义伟大作家们所共有的特点，也正是社会主义现实主义创作方法的历史渊源之一。
    谢德林站在他的时代的最先进的思想的水平上，不仅抨击和嘲笑了那些反动势力的昏庸无耻，并且揭发了那些改良主义的空谈家的伪善和无能。他的许多著名的寓言故事，例如“理想主义者的鲫鱼”、“文艺保护者的老鹰”、“欢喜推理的野兔”等等，都极其鲜明地、恰当地和有力地揭露了那种伪善的空谈的哲学在反动统治者面前的无能和对于善良的人民的毒害。在“人生琐事”这部作品里，谢德林的锋芒有力地指向了资产阶级的庸俗无聊到了极点的、完全失去了人生的理想和志气的生活方式，而这种生活方式，正是今天资本主义世界的统治阶级为了从精神上奴役人民、为了束缚人民的心灵活动而不遗余力地加以鼓励和宣扬的“美国生活方式”的灵魂。谢德林对于俄国人民的美好的未来抱着坚定的热烈的信心。例如在“良心丢了”这篇小小的寓言故事中间，他把希望坚定地寄托在“孩子”身上，并且确信在孩子长大之后，“良心”随着强大起来，就要摧毁和消灭旧世界的一切罪恶。但是谢德林还不仅把希望寄托于未来，他已经在现实里面看到了积极的因素。这就加强了他的讽刺的力量。这也就是他的作品决不会产生任何空虚绝望的感觉而只会增加对于人民的力量的信心的缘故。他对于他的时代的正面人物的英雄形象是具有深刻的感受的，例如“塔什干的先生们”这个集子里的“就是他们”这篇里面就出现了一个青年的革命者的光辉的形象。
    谢德林的许多作品不仅对于当时的知识界产生了极大的影响，而且广泛地流传民间，使他成为当时和身后拥有读者最多的作家之一，因而和群众的斗争逐步结合了起来。他所揭发的许多否定人物的典型，给人以难忘的深刻的印象，成了永久流传的教训。例如“戈罗维略夫老爷们”里的犹杜式卡，“某城历史”里的格鲁波夫，“庞巴杜尔”里的庞巴杜尔，还有“非常聪明的绦鱼”，“理想主义者的鲫鱼”等等，都已经逐渐变成俄罗斯语言中的普通名词一样了。列宁、斯大林和苏联共产党对于谢德林的贡献给予了高度的评价。列宁、斯大林常常引用谢德林的文学形象来教育大家；苏联共产党中央向苏联作家提出了学习果戈理和谢德林并且培养“苏维埃的果戈理和谢德林”的号召。
    在建设社会主义的伟大事业中间，我们对讽刺文学的需要是不会少于苏联的。但我们并不是随便什么样的讽刺都要。毛泽东同志在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中早就说过：
    “我们是否废除讽刺？不是的，讽刺是永远需要的。但是有几种讽刺：有对付敌人的，有对付同盟者的，有对付自己队伍的，态度各有不同。我们并不一般地反对讽刺，但是必须废除讽刺的乱用。”
    这个原则正是我们今天发展讽刺文学所应该遵循的唯一正确的原则。而学习谢德林的光辉的榜样，对于我们贯彻这个原则来努力发展讽刺文学，为打击敌人、扫除建设社会主义道路中的障碍而斗争，是具有极大的意义的。
