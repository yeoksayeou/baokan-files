    Unforgettable Songs and Dances of Yugoslav Friends
    Zhao Feng, Deputy Head of the Chinese Art Troupe
    During the Chinese Art Troupe's visit to the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, we had the opportunity to appreciate the rich and diverse traditional arts and contemporary creations of Yugoslavia, and to make friendly contact with outstanding representatives of Yugoslav artists. For us, this not only further promoted the friendly relations between Chinese and Yugoslav artists, and further helped us to understand the life and struggles of the Yugoslav people, but also these unforgettable experiences of artistic life will surely contribute to our future artistic creation life.
    The Yugoslav people have a long artistic tradition. The Roman amphitheater in Pula, which can accommodate 25,000 spectators, is a magnificent and beautiful building from the first century AD. It remains one of the best examples of Roman amphitheater architecture, with a distinctive oriental national character and realistic style.
    Folk music and dance have even stronger national characteristics and a tradition of realism. Thousands of folk tunes are still passed down from generation to generation by the people, telling of beautiful love and noble fantasies. Heroic folk dances express the indomitable character and fighting spirit of the Yugoslav people. We will never forget our journey in the snowy Bosnian mountains, where our Yugoslav friends accompanied us in our car, singing continuously for several hours. Whether from the rich and varied modes, or the national characteristics of the melody to the simple and moving harmonic effects, all had moving emotions and unparalleled beauty.
    We also cannot forget the folk dances of the Yugoslav people. There is a dance called "Tesketu," which means hardship. It depicts the hard labor of the people under foreign oppression. The basic movement of this dance evolved from the difficult movement of peasants stepping on waterwheels with their feet, so this dance has an unusually strong atmosphere of life and a spirit of tenacious labor. Even more moving is a dance called "War Kolo," in which the dancers perform the heroic and unyielding struggle of the Yugoslav people against the Turkish invaders. A group of soldiers is resting, a sentry discovers the enemy, and everyone engages in an ambush, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. But there are more and more enemies, and the soldiers are outnumbered, so they have to fight hand-to-hand until all are killed in battle. This dance movingly expresses the brave character of the Yugoslav people.
    Wherever the Chinese Art Troupe went, we could hear the Yugoslav people singing partisan songs, and everywhere they affectionately and respectfully named their beloved things "Partisan." The soldiers' best football team is called "Partisan," many commodities are called "Partisan brand," many city cinemas and clubs are named after the glorious partisans, and at the end of every happy evening, people never forget to dance a collective dance called "Partisan Kolo."
    During the tour, the Chinese Art Troupe had only a few opportunities to appreciate the creations of Yugoslav artists, but it was enough to see the high artistic level and rich creativity of Yugoslav artists. At the Belgrade Theatre, we saw the national ballet "Legend of Ohrid," which movingly praised pure love and the spirit of fighting against foreign oppression. The composer, Slaven Hristić, cleverly used the characteristics of folk tunes and dance rhythms to compile symphonic-style musical passages, and the "Kolo" dance music in the last scene, whether in terms of its content of praising freedom or its strong and moving effect in form, can be cited as one of the best contemporary symphonic works. The ballet dancers of the Belgrade Theatre also showed their high artistic level, especially in the creation of folk dances, showing a high degree of fidelity to the folk style and skillful technique.
    What moved us even more was the strong interest in China shown by Yugoslav artists. We cannot forget the emotion we felt when we saw the ballet "Chinese Story" in Belgrade. This is a ballet adapted from the two stories "Yu Tang Chun" and "The Chalk Circle." This story aroused great interest among the Yugoslav people. We can imagine the difficulties that Yugoslav artists encountered in carrying out this creation with insufficient documents and lack of materials, but based on a strong desire to express the life of the Chinese people, they still excellently completed this creation, depicting the character of Yu Tang Chun, a gentle but strong ancient Chinese woman who was faithful to love.
    We cannot list all the Yugoslav artistic experiences we have experienced, such as the tempting fragments of the opera "Kostana" performed especially for us by the Sarajevo Opera House, or the comical comic opera "Mara Flajšman" by the Rijeka Opera House, or the Czechoslovak classical opera "The Bartered Bride" performed by the Ljubljana Opera House, ... all gave us deep and unforgettable impressions, and concretely demonstrated the talent and efforts shown by Yugoslav artists in various aspects. As we leave this beautiful country, we cannot but thank the Yugoslav artists for all the help they gave us during our tour, and we cannot but be moved by the unforgettable enthusiasm they showed us. We congratulate this friendship on its increasing consolidation and development, and sincerely congratulate our Yugoslav friends on achieving greater success in their artistic creation endeavors.

### 难忘的南斯拉夫朋友们的歌舞

    难忘的南斯拉夫朋友们的歌舞
    中国艺术团副团长　赵沨
    中国艺术团访问南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国期间，有机会欣赏到丰富多采的南斯拉夫的传统艺术和当代创作，并且同南斯拉夫的杰出的艺术家代表们作了友好的接触。这对我们说，不仅更进一步促进了中、南艺术家们之间的友好关系，和更进一步帮助我们了解了南斯拉夫人民的生活和斗争，而且这些令人难忘的艺术生活的经历，也必将有助于我们今后的艺术创造生活。
    南斯拉夫人民有着久远的艺术传统。普拉地方的罗马式圆形剧场，可以容纳25，000观众，这个公元第一世纪的宏伟美丽的建筑物，至今仍是罗马圆形剧场建筑的最好的典范之一，有着显著的东方式的民族色彩和写实主义的作风。
    民间音乐和舞蹈更有着强烈的民族特点和现实主义传统。数以千计的民间曲调至今仍被人民家传户诵，诉说着美丽的爱情和崇高的幻想。英武的民间舞蹈表现着南斯拉夫人民那种不屈的性格和斗争精神。我们忘记不了在大雪的波斯内丛山中的旅行，在我们的汽车中，陪伴我们的南斯拉夫的朋友们一连地歌唱了几个小时。无论从调式的丰富多采，或者是曲调进行的民族特点以至简洁动人的和声效果，都是有着令人感动的情绪和无与伦比的美丽。
    我们也忘记不了南斯拉夫人民的民间舞蹈。有一种舞蹈的名字叫做“特赛柯图”，意思就是艰苦。是描写人民在异族压迫下的艰苦劳动的。这种舞蹈的基本动作是从农民用脚艰难地踏水车的动作演化出来的，因而这种舞蹈便具有异常浓厚的生活气息和顽强劳动的精神。更为动人的是一种叫做“战争科罗”的舞蹈，舞者表演了南斯拉夫人民为反对土耳其人侵略所作的英勇不屈的斗争。一群战士在休息，哨兵发现了敌人，大家投入了伏击的战斗，使敌人受到严重的损失。但敌人愈来愈多，寡不敌众，战士们只好用力来肉搏，直到全体战死。这个舞蹈动人地表现了南斯拉夫人民勇敢的性格特点。
    中国艺术团不论走到哪里，都能听到南斯拉夫人民歌唱着游击队的歌曲，并且到处用尊敬和亲切的感情把心爱的事物命名为“游击队”。士兵们最好的足球队的名字叫做“游击队”，许多商品叫“游击队员牌”，许多城市的电影院、俱乐部都以光荣的游击队命名，而每一个愉快的晚会的最后，人们也总不忘记跳一个名叫“游击队科罗”的集体舞。
    中国艺术团在旅行演出期间，只有很少的机会欣赏南斯拉夫艺术家们的创作，但也足以看出南斯拉夫的艺术家们的高度艺术水平和丰富的创造力。我们在贝尔格莱德剧院看到了民族舞剧“奥赫列斯卡传奇”，这个舞剧动人地歌颂了纯洁的爱情和反异族压迫的斗争精神。作曲家斯拉芬·赫列斯提奇巧妙地利用了民间的曲调和舞蹈的节奏特点，编成了交响乐式的乐篇，而最后一个场面的“科罗”舞曲，无论就内容上对自由的歌颂或者是形式上的强烈感人的效果来说，都可以举为当代最好的交响乐著作之一。贝尔格莱德剧院的舞剧演员们也表现了自己的高度艺术水平，特别在民间舞的创作中显示了高度的对民间风格的忠实和纯熟的技巧。
    更使我们感动的是南斯拉夫艺术家所表现的那种对中国的浓厚的兴趣。我们不能忘记我们在贝尔格莱德看到舞剧“中国故事”时所受到的感动。这是根据“玉堂春”和“灰阑记”两个故事合并改编的一出舞剧。这个故事引起南斯拉夫人民的巨大的兴趣，我们可以想像南斯拉夫艺术家们在文献不足、材料缺乏的条件下进行这个创作所遇到的困难，但他们基于一种表现中国人民生活的强烈愿望，仍然出色地完成了这个创作，描写了玉堂春这样一个温柔而又刚强的忠实于爱情的中国古代女性的性格。
    我们不能一一列举我们所经历的南斯拉夫艺术生活的一切，比如萨拉那窝歌剧院专为我们表演的歌剧“卡斯坦娜”的诱人的片断，或者是里卡歌剧院的滑稽的喜歌剧“马拉弗罗拉禾”，或者是留布里安那歌剧院演出的捷克斯洛伐克古典歌剧“被出卖的新嫁娘”，……都给予我们深刻难忘的印象，也具体地表现了南斯拉夫艺术家在各方面表现出来的才能和努力。在我们离开这个美丽的国家的时候，我们不能不感谢南斯拉夫艺术家们在我们旅行演出中所给予我们的各种帮助，更不能不为他们对我们所表现的那种令人难忘的热情所感动，我们祝贺这种友谊能日益巩固和发展，更衷心地祝贺南斯拉夫朋友们在自己的艺术创造事业中获得更大的成就。
