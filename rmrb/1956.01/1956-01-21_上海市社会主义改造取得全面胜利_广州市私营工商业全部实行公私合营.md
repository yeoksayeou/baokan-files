    (Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 20th) Guangzhou, the largest industrial and commercial city in southern China, today victoriously completed the historic task of carrying out industry-wide joint public-private ownership of all private industry and commerce in the city. Liang Xiang, Deputy Mayor of Guangzhou, announced at a meeting convened today by the Municipal People's Committee to the more than 60,000 employees and industrialists and businessmen present: The Guangzhou Municipal People's Committee has decided to accept the application of private industrialists and businessmen in the city, and approved more than 4,000 factories in 138 industrial sectors, and more than 16,000 enterprises in 132 sectors of commerce, service industry, catering industry, and transportation industry, to implement industry-wide joint public-private ownership. At this time, the entire Yuexiu Mountain Square was filled with cheers, gongs, drums, and firecrackers. Countless workers, shop assistants, private industrialists and businessmen, and citizens standing in the streets and alleys of the city, waiting for the good news, also cheered with the good news broadcast on the radio.
    Liang Xiang then called on the employees of private enterprises in the city to quickly assist in doing a good job in asset verification and economic restructuring. He also praised the business community for their active actions in welcoming socialist transformation, such as applying for joint public-private ownership in its entirety within three days and investing more than 800,000 yuan of off-book funds, as well as gold, silver, and real estate, into the enterprise. At the same time, he hoped that the industrialists and businessmen would further contribute to socialism.
    Huang Changshui, Chairman of the Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce, said at the meeting: "We industrialists and businessmen have made very little contribution to the people in the past. We must quickly do a good job in asset verification, happily accept personnel arrangements, and assist the government in doing a good job in economic restructuring and enterprise reform in the process of joint public-private ownership. Strive to make contributions! Make more contributions!" Huang Changshui's expression of this determination on behalf of the city's industrialists and businessmen was repeatedly welcomed with applause from the audience.
