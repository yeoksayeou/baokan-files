Congratulations on the China-Mongolia-Soviet Union Railway Joint Transport
Premier Zhou's Telegram to Chairman Bulganin

To Comrade N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Socialist Republics:

	On the eve of the completion of the railway from Jining to Ulaanbaatar and the start of joint transport between China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union, I, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, extend warm congratulations to you, and through you to the government and people of the Soviet Union, and express heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and people for their selfless assistance in the construction of this railway.

	The construction of this railway connecting the three countries of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China, and the railway joint transport between our three countries will certainly strengthen the economic and cultural ties between our three countries, and will greatly promote the political, economic, and cultural development of our border regions. Therefore, it has special significance for the Chinese people who are engaged in socialist construction.

	I wish the great Soviet people even greater achievements in the cause of building a prosperous and happy communist society.

	Long live the fraternal and eternal friendship and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and China!
		
		Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai
