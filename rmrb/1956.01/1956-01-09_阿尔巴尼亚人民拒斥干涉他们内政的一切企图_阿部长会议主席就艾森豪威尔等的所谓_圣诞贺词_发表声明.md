Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 8th: According to the Albanian Telegraph Agency, the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published on the 7th a statement by the Chairman of the Albanian Council of Ministers, Shehu, regarding the so-called "Christmas Greetings" from Eisenhower and other American leaders.

The statement said: A few days ago, during Christmas, U.S. President Eisenhower, Secretary of State Dulles, and other American officials issued so-called "Christmas Greetings" to the people of people's democratic countries, including the Albanian people. In these "greetings," they "expressed sympathy" for the people of these countries and "prayed to God" to change the existing social order in these countries and restore the old system of capitalists and landlords. At the same time, they openly promised that the United States would help to realize this delusion. There is no doubt that such remarks can only be regarded as a crude interference in the internal affairs of independent and sovereign countries.

The statement then pointed out that this interference in Albania's internal affairs by the U.S. government is nothing new to the Albanian people. The history of the past 11 years is full of facts proving the United States' hostility towards the People's Republic of Albania. This behavior proves that the U.S. government continues to implement the bankrupt "position of strength" policy, clearly violating the "Geneva spirit" and the efforts of peace-loving countries to ease international tensions. There is no doubt that this policy is doomed to failure.

The statement emphasized that the Albanian people despise and reject all attempts to interfere in their internal affairs. They firmly protest against these so-called "greetings." They are confidently advancing along the path they have chosen – the path of socialism. No force can make them leave this path.

　　阿尔巴尼亚人民拒斥干涉他们内政的一切企图
　　阿部长会议主席就艾森豪威尔等的所谓“圣诞贺词”发表声明
    新华社布拉格8日电　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”在7日发表了阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡就艾森豪威尔和美国其他领导人的所谓“圣诞贺词”所发表的声明。
    声明说：几天以前，在圣诞节的时候，美国总统艾森豪威尔、国务卿杜勒斯和美国其他官方人士向人民民主国家人民，其中包括阿尔巴尼亚人民，发表了所谓“圣诞贺词”，他们在这些“贺词”中“表示同情”这些国家的人民，并且“祈祷上帝”改变这些国家现有的社会秩序和恢复资本家和地主的旧制度。同时他们还公开答应美国要帮助实现这种妄想。毫无疑问，这种言论只能够认为是对独立自主国家的内政的粗暴干涉。
    声明接着指出，美国政府对阿尔巴尼亚内政的这种干涉，对阿尔巴尼亚人民来说并不是什么新的事情。近11年来的历史充满了证明美国敌视阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的事实。这种行为证明美国政府继续在实行已经破了产的“实力地位”政策，明显地违背“日内瓦精神”和爱好和平的各国人民为缓和国际紧张局势而作的努力。毫无疑问，这种政策注定是要失败的。
    声明强调说，阿尔巴尼亚人民鄙视地拒斥干涉他们内政的一切企图。他们坚决抗议这种所谓“贺词”。他们正满怀信心地沿着他们所选择的道路——社会主义的道路前进。没有任何力量可以使他们离开这条道路。
