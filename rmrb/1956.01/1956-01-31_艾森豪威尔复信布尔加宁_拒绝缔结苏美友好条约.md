Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 30th: U.S. President Eisenhower wrote a reply on the 28th to Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin.

Eisenhower acknowledged that "the current international situation requires all countries, especially major powers, to find ways to ease international tensions and strengthen international trust and cooperation." The letter then stated that "those entrusted with political power have a lofty responsibility to satisfy the universal desire of all peoples for peace," and that "better political relations can be established on the basis of the historical friendship between the people of the United States and the Soviet Union..."

However, Eisenhower refused the suggestion in the letter to conclude a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. He argued that the United Nations Charter already contains the content of this treaty. He insisted that concluding this treaty would "create a delusion" and would "actually be detrimental to the cause of peace."

Eisenhower also attempted to shift the responsibility for the failure of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to reach an agreement, and the unwillingness of American ruling figures to see an easing of international tensions, onto the Soviet Union. He also repeated the U.S. government's old claims regarding German reunification and aerial inspection.

Eisenhower concluded by expressing his hope to receive "further expressions of opinion" from Bulganin.

    艾森豪威尔复信布尔加宁
    拒绝缔结苏美友好条约
    据新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔在28日写回信给苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁。
    艾森豪威尔承认，“目前的国际局势需要各国、特别是大国来设法缓和国际紧张局势和加强国际信任和合作”。信中接着谈到，“被委以政治权力的人们负有崇高的责任来满足各国人民对和平的普遍渴望”，在美国和苏联“两国人民的历史性友谊……的基础上，可以建立起更好的政治关系”。
    但是，艾森豪威尔在信里拒绝了缔结苏联和美国友好合作条约的建议。他辩护说，联合国宪章已经包含这个条约的内容。他硬说，缔结这个条约会“造成一种错觉”，会“实际上不利于和平事业”。
    艾森豪威尔还企图把四国外交部长会议没有达成协议的责任和美国统治人物不愿见到国际紧张局势缓和的责任推到苏联身上。他还重复提出了美国政府关于德国统一、空中视察等问题的陈旧主张。
    艾森豪威尔最后表示，他希望获得布尔加宁“进一步表示的意见”。
