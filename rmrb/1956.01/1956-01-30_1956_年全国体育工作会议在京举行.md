In 1955, in addition to the original China Locomotive Sports Association, 11 industrial systems established national sports associations or their preparatory committees; according to statistics from 27 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, 4,098 schools implemented Level 1 or preparatory level of the "Labor and Defense System," with more than 2.33 million students participating in the exercise; 17 national competitions and sports meets were held; and the number of international sports activities also increased significantly compared to 1954.
    The conference also criticized the right-leaning conservative ideology in sports work, and determined the policy of accelerating the development of mass sports activities, striving to improve the level of sports on the basis of widespread mass movements, and striving to approach or catch up with international levels in several events within two or three years. The conference also exchanged views on the formulation of a 12-year sports work plan.
    Representatives from the sports commissions of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, as well as representatives from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and sports associations of various industrial systems, attended the conference.
