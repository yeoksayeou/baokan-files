After a fortunate and pleasant visit to your country, please allow me, personally and on behalf of my colleagues, to bid farewell to you; to express once again the sincere respect and best wishes of the Chinese people to the fraternal Hungarian people.

During our stay in the Hungarian People's Republic, we personally witnessed the brilliant achievements of the Hungarian working class and intellectuals in developing socialist industry, especially heavy industry, and saw the remarkable progress of Hungarian working peasants in developing agricultural cooperation and increasing agricultural production. This not only greatly encouraged us, but also gave us the opportunity to learn more directly from your experiences in construction.

The extremely cordial and thoughtful reception given to me and my colleagues by the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party, the Government of the Hungarian People's Republic, and the Hungarian people is a manifestation of the Hungarian people's profound fraternal friendship with the Chinese people. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude here.

Now the Chinese and Hungarian people are both advancing with full confidence towards the great victory of building socialism and defending peace. The ever-strengthening and comprehensive development of the fraternal friendship and cooperation between our two peoples, united in the big family of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, will greatly strengthen the strength of our two peoples and the entire peace, democracy, and socialist camp. The great unity and friendship between our peoples will guarantee the realization of our common ideals and the victory of our common cause.

Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people!

Long live the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!
