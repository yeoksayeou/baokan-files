Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 23rd: The Egyptian Journalists Delegation, before leaving Guangzhou to return to their country, published a farewell letter signed by all members of the delegation, saying, "We will return to our country with the friendship of 600 million Chinese people, and bring this friendship to the Egyptian people."

The farewell letter said: "In fact, the friendship between the Chinese and Egyptian people was not established today, but has a long history. For thousands of years, China and Egypt have been spreading civilization to each other, and the relationship has always been good. If the relationship between the two countries was ever interrupted, it was the fault of imperialism. Imperialists and reactionaries previously carried out heinous rule over these two countries. Now that these two countries have been freed from the rule of imperialists and reactionaries, the two countries are beginning to restore their old relationship. For the sake of world peace and the interests of the people of both countries, the two countries should help each other."

The farewell letter said: "We have all started this work. We will continue to move forward on the road of mutual assistance until we achieve our great goal - world peace."

The farewell letter also said: "Our greatest hope is to be able to welcome our Chinese brothers in Egypt, and let us help them understand the situation of Egypt's rejuvenation, as well as the efforts made by the Egyptian people for construction."

    埃及新闻工作者代表团的告别书
    据新华社广州23日电　埃及新闻工作者代表团在离开广州回国以前发表的一封由全体团员签名的告别书说：“我们将带着6亿中国人民的友谊回到祖国，把这种友谊带给埃及人民。”
    告别书说：“事实上，中埃两国人民之间的友谊不是今天才建立的，而是有着悠久的历史的。几千年以来，中埃两国一直互相传播着文明，关系一直是很好的。假若说两国的关系曾有过中断，那是帝国主义的罪过，帝国主义者和反动派在以前对这两个国家进行了罪恶的统治。现在这两个国家从帝国主义者和反动派的统治中解脱出来了，两国开始恢复旧有的关系，为了世界的和平与两国人民的利益，两国之间应互相帮助。”
    告别书说：“我们大家已经开始了这项工作。我们将继续在互助的道路上前进，直到实现我们伟大的目标——全世界和平。”
    告别书并且说：“我们最大的希望就是能够在埃及迎接中国的兄弟们，让我们帮助他们来了解埃及复兴的状况，以及埃及人民为了建设所作的努力。”
