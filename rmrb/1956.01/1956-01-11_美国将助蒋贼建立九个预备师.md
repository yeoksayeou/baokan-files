Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek’s "Ministry of National Defense" and the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group issued a joint communique on January 9th, stating that they had formally signed a "Reserve and Replenishment System Plan" for the Chiang Kai-shek army on December 29th of last year. According to this plan, the Chiang Kai-shek army will establish nine reserve divisions.

This plan is part of a scheme by the U.S. and Chiang to forcibly conscript Taiwanese young men to replenish Chiang Kai-shek's mercenary troops. The plan stipulates that each forcibly conscripted young man, after serving two years in the regular army, must also serve five years in the reserve division. The equipment for the reserve division will be provided by the United States.

    美国将助蒋贼建立九个预备师
    新华社10日讯　蒋贼“国防部”和美国军事援助顾问团在1月9日发表联合公报说，它们已经在去年12月29日正式签订一项蒋贼军“后备及补充制度的方案”。根据这个方案，蒋贼军将建立九个预备师。
    这个方案是美蒋为了强征台湾壮丁来替补蒋贼胡子兵的计划的一部分。方案规定，每个被强征的壮丁在常备部队中服役两年后，还要在预备师中服役五年。预备师的装备由美国提供。
