    "Unfortunate Thing"
    Believe it or not. It is said that the fact that the United States occupies Taiwan is "non-existent."
    This discovery was made by Moussa, an Associated Press reporter in Taiwan, after being "enlightened" by the U.S. State Department. In a statement on January 21, the U.S. State Department shamelessly stated, "The United States does not occupy Taiwan."
    According to Moussa, the fact that the United States occupies Taiwan is "non-existent." What exists is only the "U.S. Taiwan Defense Command" and the "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group," guarded by Chiang Kai-shek bandit military police, and its "naval and air force departments."
    According to Moussa, the U.S. air and naval bases in Taiwan are also "non-existent." What exists is only that U.S. warships are "using" Taiwan's "ports"; "a squadron of U.S. Sabre jet fighters is stationed in Taiwan on a rotating basis"; and the total number of Americans in Taiwan "does not exceed seven thousand."
    Anyone with a little common sense can see that Moussa is just playing games with his own words: everything he says "doesn't exist" obviously does exist.
    On the other hand, many facts that everyone knows to exist are "non-existent" in Moussa's article reporting on "facts."
    For example, everyone knows that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army is nothing more than a U.S. mercenary army. The "U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group" completely controls this army, from its decision-making command organs all the way down to the companies, and from its planes and artillery all the way down to the soldiers' food and pocket money.
    For another example, everyone knows that the United States has openly stated that China's Taiwan is a link in the U.S. island base chain in the Western Pacific, and therefore it must use war to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. In order to realize turning Taiwan into a U.S. base, the United States interferes in China's internal affairs, acts as the protector of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit clique, and has obtained the "right" to station U.S. army, navy, and air forces in Taiwan through the U.S.-Chiang treaty. The United States even used this illegal treaty as a basis to demand that China recognize the so-called "self-defense" rights of the United States in Taiwan during the Sino-U.S. talks, as if it regarded China's territory as the U.S.'s own.
    Moussa concealed all these facts and concluded without difficulty that the fact that the United States occupies Taiwan is "non-existent." Unfortunately, peace-loving people all over the world will not forget these facts. The whole world knows that the United States has occupied China's territory of Taiwan. No matter how the U.S. State Department and Moussa deny it, the facts cannot be erased. According to Moussa, a "foreigner" in Taiwan called this an "unfortunate thing." But when has there ever been a "fortunate thing" that could make people believe that occupying another country's territory thousands of kilometers away is not aggression but the exercise of the so-called "inherent right of self-defense"?

### “不幸的事”

    “不幸的事”
    信不信由你。据说，美国侵占台湾的事实是“不存在”的。
    这个发现是美联社在台湾的记者穆萨受到美国国务院的“启示”以后作出的。美国国务院在1月21日的声明中脸也不红地说过，“美国不是霸占台湾。”
    据穆萨说，美国侵占台湾的事实是“不存在”的，存在的只不过是由蒋贼宪兵“守卫”的“美军协防台湾司令部”、“美国军事援助顾问团”和它的“海军和空军部门”。
    据穆萨说，美国在台湾的空军和海军基地也是“不存在”的，存在的只不过是美国军舰“使用着”台湾的“口岸”；“有一支美国佩刀式喷气机中队在轮流的基础上驻在台湾”；在台湾的美国人“总共不会超过七千人”。
    稍有常识的人都可以看出，穆萨不过是在拿自己的嘴巴打着玩：凡是他说“不存在”的东西明摆着都是存在的。
    倒是有许多人人都知道存在的事实，在穆萨这篇报道“事实”的文章中却都“不存在”了。
    比如说，人人都知道的事实是：蒋贼军不过是美国的雇佣军队。“美国军事援助顾问团”全部控制了这支军队，从它的决策指挥机关一直到连队，从它的飞机大炮一直到士兵的伙食和零用钱。
    再比如说，人人都知道的事实是：美国公开说过中国的台湾是美国在西太平洋的岛屿基地锁炼中的一环，因此必须用战争来阻挠中国人民解放台湾。为了实现把台湾变成美国的基地，美国干涉中国内政，充当蒋贼集团的保护人，通过美蒋条约取得了在台湾驻扎美国陆海空军的“权利”。美国甚至以这个非法条约为根据，在中美会谈中要求中国承认美国在台湾有所谓“自卫”权利，俨然把中国的领土当作是美国的地方。
    穆萨把这些事实都隐瞒了起来，并且毫不困难地得出结论说，美国侵占台湾的事实是“不存在”的。可惜，全世界爱好和平的人民是不会忘记这些事实的。全世界都知道，美国侵占了中国的领土台湾。任凭美国国务院和穆萨怎样抵赖，事实总归是抹煞不了的。据穆萨说，在台湾的一名“外国人”把这说成是“不幸的事”。但是什么时候又有过能够使人相信占领几千公里以外的别国领土不是侵略而是行使所谓“自卫的固有权利”这种“有幸的事”呢？（江）
