To the Editor:

    In our minority areas of Bijie, Guizhou, especially in the Miao and Yi areas, there has always been a custom called "Da Ga." Every year after the autumn harvest, families invite relatives and friends to a large banquet, slaughtering the best bull in the house, or even the only ox, to sacrifice to ancestors and "fulfill vows." After liberation, many farmers who couldn't afford cattle in the past now have them, and they believe that they should "slaughter cattle to fulfill vows" after becoming masters, resulting in a large number of cattle being slaughtered. According to a survey by the Qianxi Ethnic Affairs Committee, in 1953 alone, 347 cattle were killed in the county due to "Da Ga," along with 748 pigs, 112 sheep, and over 9,000 chickens as "sacrificial offerings," consuming over 337,000 jin of corn. This number is astonishing!

    In October 1955, the ethnic affairs committees of Qianxi, Dading, and other counties, following the instructions of the higher-level Party committees and people's governments, successively convened ethnic symposiums at the county and district levels. At the meetings, in accordance with the spirit of the Party's ethnic policy during the transition period, they enlightened the fraternal ethnic groups to raise their socialist consciousness and, on the principle of voluntariness, appropriately reform ethnic customs to achieve the goals of protecting cattle and developing production. After heated discussions, the representatives realized that "Da Ga" was detrimental to both developing production and improving livelihoods. Miao representatives Yang Shaocheng, Yang Shunqing, and others painfully called "Da Ga" the "root of poverty for the Miao people," pointing out that if it continued, they would never have a good life! Luo Kaizhou, a poor Miao peasant from Shiban Township in Qianxi, talked about the consequences of his family's "Da Ga" in the winter of 1953: that time, his family slaughtered three cattle, with seven pigs and 95 chickens as sacrificial offerings, consuming over 2,100 jin of corn for food and brewing wine; when the spring plowing season came in 1954, the family had no food to eat and lacked seeds for planting, and it was only thanks to the relief from the people's government that they survived the crisis.

    After returning, the representatives actively carried out propaganda and education among the masses to reform the "Da Ga" custom, which achieved great results. In Shiban Township, Qianxi Tenth District, eight households originally planned to "Da Ga" in 1955, but after persuasion by Miao women's committee member Wang Yongzhen and others, six households voluntarily gave up the idea; mutual aid team leader Yang Ruwen (Miao) originally planned to slaughter three cattle, but after hearing the propaganda, he decided not to slaughter any. Tao Jianting, a Miao farmer from Haima Township in Dading Second District, originally planned to slaughter his only ox for "Da Ga," but after persuasion and education, he bought two roosters instead and kept the ox. It is understood that in 1955, farmers of all ethnic groups in Qianxi and Dading counties originally planned to use more than 400 cattle for "Da Ga," but after persuasion and mobilization, they were able to slaughter about 250 fewer. This will bring great benefits to the spring plowing production in 1956.

### 可不能再“打戛”了

　　可不能再“打戛”了
　　编辑同志：
    在我们贵州毕节少数民族地区，特别是苗族和彝族地区，历来就流传着一种风习——“打戛”。每当秋收之后，各家就邀请亲友，大排酒宴，把家里最好的公牛，甚至是唯一的耕牛，杀了祭祖“还愿”。解放以后，过去很多养不起牛的农民也有了牛，认为翻身以后应该“杀牛还愿”了，因而出现了大量宰杀耕牛的现象。据黔西民族事务委员会的调查，1953年全县因为“打戛”而被杀的耕牛就有347条，还“陪祭”了猪748只，羊112只，鸡9，000多只，吃喝掉包谷337，000多斤。这个数字是多么惊人呀！
    1955年10月，黔西、大定等县的民族事务委员会根据上级党委和人民政府的指示，先后召开了县、区两级民族座谈会。会上，根据党在过渡时期的民族政策的精神，启发兄弟民族提高社会主义觉悟，在自觉自愿的原则下，适当改革民族风习，达到保护耕牛、发展生产的目的。代表们经过热烈的讨论，认识到“打戛”对发展生产和改善生活都是不利的。苗族代表杨少成、杨顺清等沉痛地把“打戛”叫做“苗家的穷根子”，指出再打下去永远也没得好日子过！黔西石板乡苗族贫农罗开舟谈到了他家1953年冬季“打戛”造成的后果：那次他家杀了牛三条，陪祭的猪七只，鸡95只，吃饭和煮酒用去包谷2，100多斤；到1954年春耕生产的时候，家里没饭吃，地里缺种粮，亏得人民政府救济，才渡过了难关。
    代表们回去以后，积极向群众进行改革“打戛”习惯的宣传教育，收到了很大的效果。黔西十区石板乡1955年原有八户要“打戛”，经过苗族妇女委员王永珍等的说服，有六户自愿不打了；互助组长杨如文（苗族）原来准备要杀三条牛，听了宣传以后决定一条牛也不杀了。大定二区海马乡苗族农民陶建廷本来准备把自己的一条牛杀掉“打戛”，经过说服教育以后买了两只公鸡来带替，把牛保留下来了。据了解，1955年黔西、大定两县各族农民本来计划用于“打戛”的牛共四百多条，经过说服动员以后，大约可以少杀250条左右。这将给1956年的春耕生产带来很大好处。
