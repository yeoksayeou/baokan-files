Strive to Meet the Peasants' Requirements for Popular Reading Materials

The peasants urgently need popular reading materials. There are currently about 45 million people in rural areas with a considerable level of education, and they need to read popular reading materials to consolidate the knowledge they have acquired and continue to improve their cultural level. Illiterate people also need to look at pictures and listen to others read and tell stories. With the development of the movement to eliminate illiteracy, the current 180 million young and middle-aged illiterate people in rural areas will gradually become literate in the next seven years; and the number of rural cadres and rural intellectuals will also increase significantly in the next few years. The demand of peasants and rural cadres for popular reading materials is becoming more and more urgent.

The reason why peasants have an increasingly urgent demand for popular reading materials is that the development of the agricultural cooperation movement requires a corresponding development of cultural undertakings. From the point of view of business management alone, cooperative societies engaged in collective production, regardless of their size or the number of households, are much more complex than individual production. Culture is an important condition. Moreover, with the development of the cooperative movement, agriculture will gradually become mechanized and electrified, which will require even more culture. Socialist and communist education can only be carried out more effectively with the help of the popularization and improvement of culture among the broad masses of peasants.

However, the current publication and distribution of books and newspapers lags far behind the reality of the socialist transformation of agriculture, and is far from meeting the needs of the broad masses of peasants. In 1954, 950 million copies of books were distributed nationwide. In 1955, it is estimated that a total of 23,000 kinds of books were published nationwide, about 1 billion copies, of which about one-third were popular reading materials. However, of these one-third of popular reading materials, apart from those distributed to cities and industrial and mining areas, the number sent to rural areas is not many, and the number that can be directly delivered to the hands of peasants and that peasants can read and listen to is even less. Such reading materials are generally limited to textbooks, calendars, New Year pictures, and a few other types for people's schools; other types are simply pitifully few. Why is this so? One of the reasons is that the editorial departments of many publishing houses look down on popularization work, and many editors, authors, and painters do not pay attention to, or are unwilling to write and edit popular books and pictures, especially not paying attention to, or are unwilling to write reading materials for peasants. They mistakenly believe that this kind of work will lower their status and level. Some people also think that peasants are illiterate and cannot read any reading materials, underestimating the reading ability of peasants, and not seeing that the number of literate people and people with reading ability in rural areas is increasing day by day. On the other hand, a considerable part of the existing popular reading materials are not popular, and peasants cannot understand them. The number of popular reading materials that peasants can understand is already small, and because some distribution departments simply use the completion of financial plans and the amount of money earned to measure the performance of their work, they like to sell large books with high prices, and do not like small pamphlets with low prices, ignoring the urgent needs of the broad masses; in addition, the grassroots distribution units have few staff, and have not effectively used social forces (such as supply and marketing cooperatives, production cooperatives, and voluntary postal stations organized by the Communist Youth League), so that they cannot widely distribute these reading materials to readers. This has created the phenomenon that peasants want to read books and look at pictures, but there are no books and pictures to read and look at. Chairman Mao told us that the serious problem is to educate the peasants. Although some publishing houses have published a certain number of popular reading materials, generally speaking, the publishing and distribution work has not fulfilled the responsibility of educating the peasants. This situation should no longer continue, and must be changed immediately.

The reading materials that peasants urgently need include one type of literacy textbooks. These textbooks are either compiled by the township or cooperative, by the county, or by the province; whichever type should be compiled as quickly as possible to meet the needs of the literacy campaign. Another type is needed by peasants who have a basic understanding of writing (for example, knowing 500 to 1,500 characters). This generally includes materials related to explaining the various policies of the Party and the government, related to political and current affairs knowledge, related to general knowledge of natural science and agricultural science and technology, related to business knowledge of running agricultural cooperatives, and related to literature and art. As for rural work cadres below the county level, they also have needs in many aspects, especially books explaining policies and guiding work. Popular reading materials should meet the various needs of various types of readers in rural areas.

Meeting the peasants' needs for popular reading materials is a current political task. It is hoped that writers, scientists, editors, journalists, cultural workers, and amateur writers in various work posts will take action and write more and better popular reading materials that peasants and rural cadres can understand. It is hoped that all relevant publishing houses, especially publishing houses that are responsible for publishing popular reading materials, such as the Popular Reading Materials Publishing House in Beijing, the China Youth Publishing House, the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, and the People's Publishing Houses in various provinces, will expand their topic selection plans in this area, vigorously organize manuscripts, and publish more popular reading materials. It is hoped that bookstores, supply and marketing cooperatives, post offices and other relevant distribution departments and distribution workers will come up with ways to effectively deliver popular reading materials to rural areas and to the hands of peasants. It is hoped that relevant departments of the central government and party and government leading organs at all levels will list the popularization of culture to rural areas and peasants and the solution of the problem of reading materials supply in rural areas as one of the important tasks in the socialist transformation of agriculture, comprehensively plan it, strengthen specific guidance, and help and urge all parties to strive to meet the cultural requirements of the broad masses of peasants and rural cadres.

### 努力满足农民对通俗读物的要求

　　努力满足农民对通俗读物的要求
    农民迫切需要通俗读物。现在农村中大约有4，500万人是有相当文化程度的，他们需要阅读通俗读物，以巩固已经取得的知识，并且继续提高文化水平。不识字的人也需要看图看画，听别人念书讲书。随着扫除文盲运动的发展，目前农村中的1.8亿青壮年文盲，将在今后七年内逐步成为读书识字的人；而农村干部和农村知识分子也将在今后几年内大量增加。农民和农村干部对通俗读物的要求一天比一天迫切。
    农民对于通俗读物所以有日益迫切的要求，是因为农业合作化运动的发展，要求文化事业有相应的发展。单就经营管理这一点来说，进行集体生产的合作社，不论规模大小，户数多少，都要比个体生产复杂得多。文化是一个重要条件。而且，随着合作化运动的发展，农业将要逐步机械化、电气化，那就更加需要文化。社会主义和共产主义的教育，只有借助于广大农民文化的普及和提高，才能更加有效地进行。
    但是，目前书籍报刊的出版和发行工作远远落后于农业社会主义改造的实际，远远不能满足广大农民的要求。1954年全国发行的书籍有95，000万册，1955年全国图书出版估计共有23，000种，约10亿册，其中大约三分之一是通俗读物。但这三分之一的通俗读物，除掉发行到城市、工矿区的以外，发到农村去的为数就不多了，能够直接送到农民手里的、农民能够看、能够听的那就更少了。这种读物大体还只能限于民校的课本、日历、年画等少数几种，其他简直少得可怜。为什么会这样呢？原因之一是不少出版社的编辑部轻视普及工作，许多编辑、作者、画家不注意、不愿意写作和编辑通俗书籍和图画，尤其不注意、不愿意写作农民的读物。他们错误地认为这种工作会降低自己的身份和水平。有的人还以为农民不识字、不能阅读什么读物，过低估计了农民的阅读能力，没有看到农村识字的人和有阅读能力的人日益增加。另一方面，已有的通俗读物有相当一部分并不通俗，农民看不懂，也听不懂。农民能够看懂、听懂的通俗读物数量本来就少，又由于某些发行部门单纯以完成财务计划、卖钱多少来衡量工作的成绩，喜欢卖大本头、定价高的书籍，不喜欢本子薄、定价低的小册子，忽视广大群众的迫切需要；加上基层发行单位人手较少，而又没有有效地运用社会力量（例如供销合作社、生产合作社、青年团所组织的义务邮电站等），以致无法广泛地把这些读物发到读者手里。这就形成农民要求看书、看画，而无书、无画可看的现象。毛主席告诉我们，严重的问题在于教育农民。目前虽然有些出版社出了一定数量的通俗读物，但一般说来，出版、发行工作方面是没有尽到教育农民的责任的。这种状况再也不应该继续下去，必须立即加以改变。
    农民迫切需要的读物，一类是扫盲课本。这种课本，有的是由乡或合作社编的，有的是由县里编的，有的是由省里编的；不论那一种都应该用最快的速度把它编出来，以适应扫除文盲工作的需要。另一类是粗通文字（例如认识500到1，500字）的农民所需要的。这大体包括有关解释党和政府的各种政策的，有关政治和时事知识的，有关自然科学和农业科学技术常识的，有关农业合作社办社的业务知识的，有关文学艺术的。至于县以下的农村工作干部，还有着多方面的需要，特别需要讲解政策和指导工作的书籍。通俗读物应该适应农村各类读者的各方面的需要。
    满足农民对通俗读物的需要，是当前的一项政治任务。希望作家、科学家、编辑、记者、文化工作者和各种工作岗位上的业余写作者，大家动手，编写更多、更好的为农民和农村干部能够看得懂、听得懂的通俗读物。希望一切有关出版社，特别是担负出版通俗读物的任务的出版社，例如北京的通俗读物出版社、中国青年出版社、人民美术出版社，各省的人民出版社，扩大这方面的选题计划，大力组织稿件，出版更多的通俗读物。希望书店、供销合作社、邮政局等有关发行部门、发行工作者想出办法，把通俗读物有效地送到农村，送到农民手里去。希望中央有关部门和各地党政领导机关把向农村、农民普及文化、解决农村读物供应问题，列为农业社会主义改造工作中的重要的任务之一，全面地加以规划，加强具体指导，帮助和督促各方面努力满足广大农民和农村干部的文化要求。
