    Construction Begins on High-Voltage Transmission Line from the Foziling Hydropower Station to Hefei City

    Construction has begun on a high-voltage transmission line from the Foziling Reservoir to Hefei City. Once completed, the electricity generated by the Foziling Hydropower Station can be directly transmitted to Hefei City to meet the needs of industrial construction.

    The line is 134 kilometers long. Currently, workers are braving the severe cold to carry out the foundation work for the iron towers and cement poles.

    The line was originally scheduled to be completed in June of this year, but the workers have proposed to strive for completion in April of this year.

    从佛子岭水库到合肥市的高压送电线路已经动工建设。它建成以后，佛子岭水电站所发的电力就可以直接送到合肥市，供应工业建设的需要。
    这条线路全长134公里。目前，职工们正冒着严寒进行铁塔和水泥杆的基础工程的施工。
    这条线路原计划今年6月完工，现在职工们提出争取在今年4月建成。
