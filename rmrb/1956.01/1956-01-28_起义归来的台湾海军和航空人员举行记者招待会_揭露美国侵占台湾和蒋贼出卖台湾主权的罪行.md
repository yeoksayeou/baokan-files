Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: Chiang gang naval and aviation personnel Wei Dawei, Liang Feng, Zhai Xiaowu, Li Wei, Yang Jiying, and others who recently revolted and returned to the mainland of the motherland, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists in Beijing on the 27th. More than 30 Chinese and foreign journalists attended the press conference.

Wei Dawei, Li Wei, and others recounted in detail their revolt and return, and exposed the crimes of U.S. imperialism seizing Taiwan and the Chiang Kai-shek clique selling out Taiwan's sovereignty and oppressing the Taiwanese people. They said that the U.S. military has designated many "restricted areas" in Taiwan, forbidding Chinese people from entering; many U.S. warships are docked in ports such as Keelung and Kaohsiung, and U.S. military aircraft fly rampant in the skies over Taiwan. Atrocities such as U.S. military personnel beating residents, molesting women, and engaging in drunken brawls in Taiwanese cities and villages occur frequently. Li Wei said that the piratical acts committed by Chiang's navy in the Taiwan Strait were also carried out under the direct instigation and assistance of the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy not only provided Chiang's army with destroyers, landing craft, and other weapons, but also provided Chiang's army with intelligence on foreign merchant ships passing through the Taiwan Strait. Yang Jiying, a former lower士官 of the Chiang gang warship "Yongding," recounted the crimes of the "Yongding" firing on fishing boats off the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian and forcibly arresting fishermen to take them to Taiwan. Yang Jiying said that this kind of piracy made me feel ashamed and made me determined to no longer be a tool of the Chiang gang to harm the people, and to return to the mainland of the motherland.

Wei Dawei, Li Wei, and others answered questions raised by the reporters.

They talked about the low morale of the Chiang gang army at present. Zhai Xiaowu said that he worked as a clerk in the Chiang gang Taipei City Police Department last summer, and every day he saw a "notification table." From this table, he could see that every day one or two hundred Chiang gang officers and soldiers were wanted for desertion. The number of Chiang gang officers and soldiers who committed suicide was also not small. Li Wei described the terror of large-scale searches and arrests in the Chiang gang Naval Academy in Taiwan.

They also said that the Taiwanese people's lives are very hard. Many people rely on sweet potatoes for food year-round, and tens of thousands of people have no housing and are displaced. Wei Dawei, Li Wei, and others all said that while in Taiwan, they did not know the situation at home because the Chiang gang forbade them from communicating with their families. After returning, they received letters from home, and everyone's family was living a happier life than before liberation. They plan to go home soon to reunite with relatives they have been separated from for many years.

Xinhua News Agency, January 26th: Li Ping, Deputy Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, met on the 26th with Wei Dawei, a pilot of the Chiang gang Taiwan Civil Aviation Administration's Taipei Flight Club, and employees Liang Feng and Zhai Xiaowu, who revolted and returned by flying an airplane from Taiwan.

Li Ping expressed a warm welcome to Wei Dawei and others for their patriotic act of flying back to the mainland of the motherland. At the same time, he introduced to Wei Dawei and others the vigorous development of China's civil aviation industry in recent years. Li Ping said that after a large number of employees of the former China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation revolted and returned in 1949 and 1950, they have made many contributions to the development of China's civil aviation industry in recent years. Li Ping said that the staff of the Civil Aviation Administration of China express deep concern for the aviation personnel in Taiwan who are under the dark rule of the Chiang gang, and hope that they will follow the example of Wei Dawei and others, return to the mainland of the motherland, and participate in the construction of the great motherland.

Wei Dawei and others said that after our return, we have been warmly received everywhere, and we have also seen with our own eyes the happy lives of the people in the new China. We will definitely study and work hard in the future and dedicate ourselves to the cause of national construction. Wei Dawei said: "Three feet off the ground, there is freedom. I hope that friends in the aviation industry in Taiwan can also get out of the sea of misery as soon as possible."

    起义归来的台湾海军和航空人员举行记者招待会
    揭露美国侵占台湾和蒋贼出卖台湾主权的罪行
    据新华社27日讯  最近起义回到祖国大陆的蒋贼海军人员和航空人员韦大卫、梁枫、翟笑梧、李韦、杨继英等，27日在北京举行中外记者招待会。出席招待会的有中外记者30多人。
    韦大卫、李韦等在会上详细叙述了他们起义归来的经过，并且揭露了美帝国主义侵占台湾和蒋介石卖国集团出卖台湾主权和压榨台湾人民的罪行。他们说，美军在台湾划了许多“禁区”，不准中国人进去；基隆、高雄等港口停泊着许多美国军舰，台湾的天空由美国军用飞机横行。美国军事人员在台湾城乡殴打居民、调戏妇女和酗酒闹事等暴行，更是经常发生。李韦说，蒋贼海军在台湾海峡干出的海盗行为，也是在美国海军直接纵使和帮助下进行的。美国海军不但把驱逐舰、登陆艇和其他武器交给蒋贼军，而且为蒋贼军提供外国商船通过台湾海峡的情报。原蒋贼“永定号”军舰下士杨继英讲述了“永定号”在浙江、福建沿海射击渔船、强抓渔民押往台湾的罪行。杨继英说，这种海盗行为使我感到羞辱，使我决心不再做蒋贼的害民工具而返回祖国大陆。
    韦大卫、李韦等回答了记者们提出的问题。
    他们谈到蒋贼军目前士气低落的情况。翟笑梧说，他去年夏天在蒋贼台北市警察局做办事员，每天看到一份“通报表”，从这表上，可以看到每天都有一二百名蒋贼军官兵因逃亡而受到通缉。蒋贼军官兵自杀的人数也不少。李韦叙述了台湾蒋贼海军军官学校中大搜查、大逮捕的恐怖情形。
    他们还说到，台湾人民生活很苦。许多人长年依靠番薯充饥，成千上万的人没有房屋住，流离失所。韦大卫、李韦等都说，在台湾时由于蒋贼禁止他们和家庭通信，因此不知道家里的情形。回来以后接到了家信，每个人的家庭都过着比解放前幸福的生活，他们准备最近回家去和分别多年的亲人团聚。
    据新华社26日讯　中国民用航空局副局长李平在26日接见了从台湾驾飞机起义归来的蒋贼台湾民用航空局台北飞行社飞行员韦大卫和职员梁枫、翟笑梧三人。
    李平对韦大卫等飞回祖国大陆的爱国行为，表示热烈欢迎。同时向韦大卫等介绍了几年来我国民航事业蓬勃发展的情况。李平说，前中国航空公司和中央航空公司的员工，在1949年和1950年大批起义归来后，这几年来对我国民航事业的发展作了许多贡献。李平说，中国民用航空局的工作人员都对处在蒋贼黑暗统治下的在台湾的航空人员，表示深切的关怀，希望他们以韦大卫等做榜样，回到祖国大陆，参加伟大祖国的建设。
    韦大卫等说，我们归来以后到处受到热情的接待，也亲眼看到新中国人民欢乐、幸福的生活。我们今后一定好好地学习和工作，献身于祖国建设事业。韦大卫说：“离地三尺，便有自由，希望在台湾的航空界朋友，也能早日脱离苦海。”
