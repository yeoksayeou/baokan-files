　　Resolutely Struggle Against the Phenomenon of Excluding Poor Peasant Cooperative Members
　　Qu Anmin

　　Although the agricultural production cooperatives in Wuli Township, Yexian County, Shandong Province, have absorbed many poor peasants into the cooperatives, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has reached 85% in the whole township, because many Communist Party members have not set an example in implementing the Party's class line, and even individual Party members discriminate against poor peasant cooperative members, a relatively serious phenomenon of discrimination and exclusion of poor peasant cooperative members has occurred in several cooperatives. For example, Ju Chunnuan, the former director of the Fifth Cooperative (former member of the township party general branch), divided the labor organization into two production teams, one for middle peasant cooperative members and one for poor peasant cooperative members. The middle peasant cooperative member team he led specialized in light work, but their work points were assessed high; the poor peasant cooperative member team did all the heavy work, but their work points were assessed low. Even the scale used by the cooperative "cheated the poor and loved the rich," weighing five jin less for things under a hundred jin and five jin more for things over a hundred jin. Many poor peasant cooperative members' income was often less than a hundred jin, so they always got a few jin less. Gao Hongyao (a Party member), the director of the Seventh Cooperative, hired three upper-middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas as "advisors," and many things were discussed with these people. Gao Hongyao and others also arbitrarily scolded poor peasant cooperative members, and threatened them with expulsion from the cooperative at every turn. Under these circumstances, more than 20 poor peasant cooperative member households in this cooperative had to request withdrawal from the cooperative. They said painfully: "The cooperative is good, but we can't stand the bullying!" This cooperative also concealed output and refused to implement the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain.

　　The reason why these Party members did not adhere to the Party's class line is that their economic status had changed, and capitalist ideas were growing. These people were unwilling to embark on the road to happiness and prosperity together, but attempted to get rich individually. These people often spread some remarks that discriminated against poor peasants. Party members like Ju Chunnuan not only excluded poor peasants, but also took the lead in undermining the state's policy of unified purchase and sale of grain.

　　To solve the serious situation of excluding poor peasant cooperative members in the cooperative, the first thing to do is to rectify the Party ranks; only after the capitalist ideas that have invaded the Party organization are eliminated can a strong leadership core be established. The Wuli Township Party General Branch started in this way to correct the phenomenon of excluding poor peasant cooperative members in the cooperative and establish the dominant position of the poor peasants.

　　The Party General Branch first conducted education on the two roads within the Party organization, so that everyone could recognize whether they should take the capitalist road or the socialist road. Everyone recalled that in the past revolutionary struggles, poor peasants always stood at the forefront of the struggle. In the land reform, the poor peasants had a firm stand and resolutely struggled. Many Party members had fought alongside these poor peasants in the past to overthrow the landlords and distribute the land, but now they had forgotten these poor peasant brothers. Thinking like this, many Party members' class consciousness was raised, and they knew that they should firmly rely on the poor peasants in the past and now. The secretary of the Nanwulizhuang Village Branch said in his self-criticism: "When our wings hardened, we forgot the revolution and forgot the poor brothers in the past. This is a serious mistake." All Party members launched a serious ideological criticism of Party member Ju Chunnuan, who had serious capitalist ideas and repeatedly refused to mend his ways, and finally expelled this person who insisted on his mistakes from the Party. The cooperative members also removed him from his position as director of the cooperative. This ideological criticism raised everyone's awareness, and Party member Liu Hongen said: "Ju Chunnuan wanted to lead everyone onto the capitalist road, and we must never take his dead end."

　　After the Party ranks were rectified, the Party General Branch began to educate the poor peasant cooperative members in the cooperative. On the one hand, the Party General Branch used methods such as holding meetings of poor peasant cooperative members and organizing Party members to conduct individual education to publicize the Party's class line to the poor peasant cooperative members, and expressed the Party organization's trust and support for the poor peasant cooperative members; on the other hand, it provided various specific assistance to the poor peasant cooperative members. For example, if some poor peasant cooperative members could not afford to pay the share capital, the Party General Branch actively helped them obtain state loans from the poor peasant cooperative fund; if two poor peasant cooperative member households in the Fourth Cooperative did not have agricultural implements, the branch secretary temporarily lent them his own agricultural implements. Zhang Zhongkun, the deputy secretary of the branch, visited poor peasant cooperative members' homes one by one to help them come up with ways to overcome difficulties. For example, two poor peasant households had to rely on making tofu to maintain their lives and could not often participate in agricultural production, so their lives were difficult every year. Zhang Zhongkun came up with an idea for them that, in addition to making tofu during festivals, they should participate in agricultural production at ordinary times; as for the current difficulties in life, the cooperative could solve them. In this way, their income would increase, and they could fundamentally change their past poor living conditions. These two poor peasant households happily accepted this idea. In addition, the Party supported the poor peasant cooperative members everywhere. In the past, the cooperative did not use the weak livestock of the poor peasant cooperative members. Now, Party members and the masses together studied ways to give play to the role of livestock in the cooperative, so that both strong and weak livestock could share the farm work. If a few middle peasant cooperative members bullied poor peasant cooperative members, the Party organization would stop them. Wang Jinming, an upper-middle peasant cooperative member of the Seventh Cooperative, specialized in light work. Once, when the poor peasant Sun Zhilong did his light work, he scolded him severely. At this time, the director of the cooperative, Gao Hongyao, criticized Wang Jinming's bad attitude. In this way, a few upper-middle peasant cooperative members dared not bully poor peasant cooperative members anymore.

　　The Party organization's assistance to the poor peasant cooperative members in all aspects deeply moved the poor peasant cooperative members. They said: "The Party and Chairman Mao have not forgotten us. Now we want to stand up straight and be masters of our own house." They showed a spirit of selflessness and hard work in production. When raising share capital, they tried every means to raise and pay it. In the "three fixings" work, they took the lead in reporting real output.

　　The advanced role of the poor peasant cooperative members drove the middle peasant cooperative members forward. For example, when the "three fixings" work began in the Sixth Cooperative, there was a phenomenon of upper-middle peasant cooperative members concealing output. Because the poor peasant cooperative members took the lead in examining their past mistakes of concealing output, the middle peasant cooperative members also admitted their mistakes and reported the real output. When the Fourth Cooperative was drawing up a production plan, the poor peasant cooperative members actively looked for the key to increasing production, while the middle peasant cooperative members had conservative ideas and were unwilling to set the production plan very high. Later, the poor peasant cooperative members set an example, and the middle peasant cooperative members gained confidence and also actively acted.

　　The phenomenon of excluding poor peasants in the whole township was reversed, and the poor peasants established a dominant position in the cooperative, and the cooperative was further consolidated. This gave all Party members and cadres a profound education, making them realize that the class line stipulated by the Party is completely correct.

　　坚决同排斥贫农社员的现象作斗争
    曲安民
    山东省掖县五里乡各个农业生产合作社，虽然吸收了许多贫农入社，全乡入社农户也已达到85％，但因为不少的共产党员没有以身作则地执行党的阶级路线，甚至个别党员还歧视贫农社员，所以在好几个合作社内发生了比较严重的歧视和排斥贫农社员的现象。例如，原第五社社长鞠春暖（原乡党总支委员）在划分劳动组织的时候，把中农社员和贫农社员组成两个生产队，他自己领导的中农社员队，专干轻活，但是工分评得高；贫农社员的队全干重活，可是工分评得低。连这个社用的秤也“欺贫爱富”，称百斤以内的东西小五斤，称百斤以上的东西大五斤，许多贫农社员的收入常在百斤以内，总是少得几斤。第七社社长高洪尧（党员）请了三个资本主义思想严重的上中农当“参谋”，许多事都和这几个人商量。高洪尧等还任意谩骂贫农社员，动不动用开除出社来威胁贫农社员。在这种情况下，这个社的20多户贫农社员不得不提出退社的要求。他们痛苦地说：“合作社好是好，就是气受不了！”这个合作社还隐瞒产量，拒不执行国家的粮食统购统销政策。
    这些党员所以没有坚持党的阶级路线，是因为他们的经济地位已经有了变化，滋长着资本主义思想。这些人不愿大家一起走上幸福富裕的道路，而企图个人发家致富。这些人经常散布一些歧视贫农的论调。像鞠春暖这类党员不仅排斥贫农，而且还带头破坏国家的粮食统购统销政策。
    要解决合作社内排斥贫农社员的严重情况，首先就要整顿党的队伍；只有把侵入党组织内的资本主义思想肃清以后，才能建立起一个强有力的领导核心。五里乡党总支就是这样着手来纠正社内排斥贫农社员的现象，确立贫农的优势地位的。
    党总支先在党组织内进行了两条道路的教育，使大家认识应该走资本主义道路还是走社会主义道路。大家回忆在过去革命斗争中，贫农总是站在斗争的最前哨的。在土地改革中，贫农立场坚定，斗争坚决。许多党员过去就同这些贫农一起斗倒了地主，分配了土地，而现在却忘记了这些贫农兄弟。这样一想，许多党员的阶级觉悟提高了，他们知道过去和现在都应该牢牢地依靠贫农。南五里庄村分支部书记在检讨中说：“硬了翅膀就忘了革命，忘了过去穷兄弟，这是严重的错误。”全体党员对资本主义思想严重并且屡教不改的党员鞠春暖展开了严肃的思想批判，最后把这个坚持错误的人开除出党。合作社社员也撤掉了他社长的职务。这次思想批判提高了大家的觉悟，党员刘洪恩说：“鞠春暖是想把大家领到资本主义道路上去，我们决不要走他这条死路。”
    党的队伍经过整顿后，党总支就着手来教育社内的贫农社员。党总支一方面用召开贫农社员会议和组织党员进行个别教育的办法，向贫农社员宣传党的阶级路线，表明党组织对贫农社员的信任和支持；另一方面给予贫农社员各种具体的帮助。如有些贫农社员交不起股金，党总支就积极帮助他们得到国家的贫农合作基金贷款；第四社两户贫农社员没有农具，分支部书记就把自己的农具暂时借给他们用。分支部副书记张仲坤挨家逐户到贫农社员家去访问，帮助他们想出克服困难的办法。例如有两户贫农要靠做豆腐来维持生活，不能经常参加农业生产，因此，他们生活年年困难。张仲坤就给他们出了个主意，除逢节日做豆腐外，他们平时要参加农业生产；至于目前生活上的困难，可由社里解决。这样，他们的收入就会多起来，就能从根本上改变过去的贫苦生活状况。这两户贫农愉快地接受了这个主意。此外，党处处给贫农社员撑腰，过去贫农社员的弱牲口，社里没有人使用，现在党员和群众一起研究出发挥社内牲口作用的办法，使强和弱的牲口都能分担到农活。少数中农社员欺侮贫农社员，党组织就加以阻止。第七社上中农社员王金明专干轻活，有一次贫农孙治龙干了他的轻活，他就大骂起来。这时社长高洪尧就批评了王金明的恶劣态度。这样一来，少数上中农社员再也不敢欺侮贫农社员了。
    党组织给予贫农社员各方面的帮助，深深地感动了贫农社员，他们说：“党和毛主席没有忘记我们，现在我们要挺起腰，当起家来。”他们在生产中表示出大公无私、任劳任怨的精神。他们在筹集股金的时候，多方设法筹集缴纳，在“三定”工作中带头报实产量。
    贫农社员的这种先进作用带动了中农社员前进。如第六社“三定”工作开始的时候，上中农社员有隐瞒产量的现象，由于贫农社员带头检查自己过去隐瞒产量的错误，中农社员也承认了错误，报实了产量。第四社订生产计划的时候，贫农社员积极找增产的关键，而中农社员有保守思想，不愿把生产计划订得很高。后来贫农社员做出了样子，中农社员才树立了信心，也积极行动起来了。
    全乡排斥贫农的现象扭转了，贫农在合作社内确立了优势地位，社就进一步巩固了。这给全体党员、干部一次深刻的教育，使他们认识到党所规定的阶级路线是完全正确的。
