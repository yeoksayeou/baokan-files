	The Soviet People Endorse the Draft of the Sixth Five-Year Plan
	The Soviet people warmly support the draft directives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's 20th Congress on the Sixth Five-Year Plan.
	Ryabov, a steelworker at the "Hammer and Sickle" steel factory in Moscow, said: The figures in the draft directives excite every Soviet person and inspire them to selfless labor.
	Academician Zhukov wrote in "Pravda" that his heart was filled with pride at the great figure: the construction of nuclear power stations with a total power generation capacity of 2 million to 2.5 million kilowatts in 1956-1960. This is evidence of the remarkable achievements of Soviet science and technology and the firm policy of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes in the broadest sense.
	Miners in the Karaganda coal region read the draft directives with great interest. A section leader at mine No. 37 said: One of our primary tasks is to ensure the further development of the coal industry. In order to mine 593 million tons of coal in 1960, we must tap all potentials. On the day the draft directives were published, the miners overfulfilled their production quota by about two hundred tons of coal.
	In the most remote parts of Altai, collective farm members, machinery operators, and agricultural experts listened attentively to the radio broadcast of the full text of the draft directives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's 20th Congress on the Sixth Five-Year Plan.

	"Pravda" Editorial Abstract
	"Pravda" published an editorial on the 16th, commenting on the draft directives of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Sixth Five-Year Plan issued by the Central Committee of the CPSU.
	The editorial wrote that the people of the Soviet Union welcomed this document of great political significance with great patriotic enthusiasm and joy. This draft is a well-founded program for the entire economic and cultural construction of our country in the coming period. It reflects the most vital interests of our people and the thoughts and aspirations of millions of Soviet people.
	The draft directives clearly reflect the Party's Leninist general line of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. The realization of the Sixth Five-Year Plan will mean the further strengthening of the Soviet Union's economic power and its unbreakable national defense forces, the significant improvement of the people's material welfare, and the upsurge of Soviet culture.
	The editorial said that the realization of the tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan is of great international significance. The great plan for Soviet economic and cultural construction expounded in the draft directives once again powerfully reveals the Soviet state's consistent policy of peace to the world. The implementation of the new Five-Year Plan will be a great contribution to further strengthening the entire socialist camp.
	The editorial said that the draft directives point out that the Soviet Union now has all the necessary conditions to solve the fundamental economic task of the Soviet Union on the road of peaceful economic competition in the shortest historical period – to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product production.
	The editorial said that this draft directive, which opens up the grand prospect of our country's communist construction, will arouse a new upsurge in the creative initiative of millions upon millions of Soviet people.

	Reflections of Public Opinion in Capitalist Countries
	Democratic newspapers in France and Italy and other countries warmly hail the new Soviet Five-Year Plan. The French "Humanité Dimanche" published an article by its Moscow correspondent saying: This document "is a new stage in the peaceful development of socialist countries, reflecting a better improvement in the material welfare of the Soviet people and rapid progress on the road of communist construction."
	Some newspapers in Britain, in their comments, regarded the vigorous development of the Soviet economy as a "challenge" to the West in the peaceful economic competition. The "Daily Express" believes that "the new Five-Year Plan marks the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution - a massive offensive aimed at surpassing the West in industry, the development of atomic energy, and agriculture..." The "Daily Mail" pointed out that the number of engineers and technicians trained in the Soviet Union "will double by the end of the new Five-Year Plan." The newspaper wrote: "Neither Britain nor the United States has been able to do this to this day."
	When commenting on this draft directive, American newspapers, in addition to trying to carry out malicious distortions, also showed obvious unease about the vigorous development of the Soviet national economy. An editorial in the "New York Times" said: "The purpose of the new plan shows that, by means of peaceful economic competition, the Soviet Union can catch up with and surpass - including the United States - the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product production in a short period." The newspaper worried that the prosperity of the Soviet economy would "show the people living in backward countries around the world that the Soviet economic system can guarantee an infinitely prosperous future in the shortest possible time."

    共产主义建设的宏伟纲领
    苏联人民拥护第六个五年计划草案
    苏联人民热烈拥护苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案。
    莫斯科“镰刀与锤子”钢铁工厂炼钢工人里亚鲍夫说：指示草案中所举的数字使每一个苏联人感到兴奋，鼓舞他们进行忘我的劳动。
    茹科夫院士在“真理报”上写道，他内心由于下面这个伟大的数字而充满自豪感：在1956—1960年将建设发电总能力为200万—250万瓩的原子能发电站。这就是苏联科学技术的卓越成就和最广泛地和平利用原子能的坚定方针的证据。
    卡拉干达煤区的矿工带着极大的兴趣阅读了指示草案。37号矿井的工段领导人说：我们的首要任务之一是保证进一步发展煤业。为了在1960年开采59，300万吨煤，必须发挥一切潜力。在公布指示草案的那一天，矿工们超任务开采了约两百吨煤。
    在阿尔泰的最遥远的地方，集体农庄庄员、机械操纵者、农业专家十分注意地倾听电台广播苏联共产党第二十次代表大会第六个五年计划的指示草案的全文。
    “真理报”社论摘要
    “真理报”在16日发表社论，评论苏共中央发表的苏联共产党关于第六个五年计划的指示草案。
    社论写道，苏联全国人民以巨大的爱国热情、欢欣鼓舞地欢迎这一具有巨大政治意义的文件。这个草案是我国今后一个时期整个经济和文化建设的确有根据的纲领。它反映了我国人民最切身的利益、千百万苏联人的思想和愿望。
    指示草案鲜明地反映出优先发展重工业这一我党的列宁主义总路线。第六个五年计划的实现将意味着苏联经济力量和它的牢不可破的国防力量的进一步加强、人民物质福利的大大提高和苏维埃文化的高涨。
    社论说，第六个五年计划任务的实现具有重大的国际意义。在指示草案中阐明的苏联经济和文化建设的伟大计划，又一次有力地向全世界揭示出苏维埃国家一贯的和平政策。新的五年计划的执行将是对进一步加强整个社会主义阵营的伟大贡献。
    社论说，指示草案指出，苏联现在具有一切的必要条件，以便在历史上最短的期间内解决苏联在和平经济竞赛道路上的根本的经济任务——在按照人口计算的产品生产量方面，赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    社论说，打开了我国共产主义建设的宏伟前景的这个指示草案，将引起千千万万苏联人的创造积极性的新的高涨。
    资本主义国家舆论的反映
    法国和意大利等国的民主报纸热烈欢呼苏联新五年计划。法国“人道报星期日刊”发表它的驻莫斯科记者的文章说：这个文件“是社会主义国家和平发展的新阶段，反映出苏联人民物质福利的更好的改善和在共产主义建设道路上的迅速进展。”
    英国的一部分报纸在评论中把苏联经济的蓬勃发展看成是在和平经济竞赛中对西方的“挑战”。“每日快报”认为，“新五年计划标志着第二次工业革命开始了——一种大规模的进攻，目的是在工业、发展原子能和农业……方面超过西方。”“每日邮报”指出，苏联培养出来的工程师和技师，“到新五年计划结束时将增加到两倍”这家报纸写道：“直到今天无论英国或美国都还无力作到这一点。”
    美国的报纸在评论这个指示草案的时候，除了力图进行恶意的歪曲以外，对苏联国民经济的蓬勃发展也表现出明显的不安。“纽约时报”的社论说：“新计划的目的表明，按照和平经济竞赛的办法，苏联在短短的时期内在按照人口计算的产品生产量方面就能赶上和超过——包括美国在内的、最发达的资本主义国家。”这家报纸担心，苏联经济的繁荣会“向居住在全世界落后国家的人民表明苏联的经济制度能够保障在最短的期限内有一个无限繁荣的前途。”
