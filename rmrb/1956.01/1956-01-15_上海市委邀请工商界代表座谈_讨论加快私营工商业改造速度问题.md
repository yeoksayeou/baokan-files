Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, January 14th: The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party today invited more than 300 representatives of industry and commerce, including Sheng Pi Hua, Rong Yi Ren, and Hu Zi Ying, to a forum to discuss learning from Beijing's advanced experience of implementing full public-private partnership for all capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises and accelerating the pace of the transformation of private industry and commerce in Shanghai.

	At the meeting, more than 30 representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors spoke, unanimously supporting the adoption of Beijing's approach to complete the public-private partnership of all private industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai in the shortest possible time. They said that accelerating the pace of transformation is precisely the urgent demand of the industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai. Some industrial and commercial figures even went to the homes of the chairmen of their respective trade associations late at night to apply for public-private partnership. Representatives from the Federation of Industry and Commerce and trade associations stated at the meeting that they would use all their strength to organize and mobilize private industrial and commercial households throughout the city to apply for public-private partnership, ensuring that the work of public-private partnership is done both quickly and well, so that partnership and production are not hindered.
	Chen Pi Xian, Second Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gave great encouragement to the enthusiasm of the industrial and commercial sectors in demanding transformation, hoping that everyone would learn well from Beijing's example based on Shanghai's specific conditions, successfully complete the public-private partnership of all private industrial and commercial enterprises in the city, and push this movement to its highest point.

    上海市委邀请工商界代表座谈
    讨论加快私营工商业改造速度问题
    据新华社上海14日电  中共上海市委会今天邀请盛丕华、荣毅仁、胡子婴等300多位工商界代表举行座谈会，讨论学习北京市资本主义工商业全部实行公私合营的先进经验和加快上海市私营工商业改造的速度问题。
    会上，有30多位工商界代表发言，他们一致拥护采取北京的办法，在最短期间全部完成上海市私营工商业的公私合营工作。他们说，加快改造的速度正是上海市工商界的迫切要求。有些工商界人士深夜还到同业公会主任委员家中申请公私合营。工商业联合会和同业公会的代表在会上表示，将以全部力量组织和动员全市私营工商业户申请公私合营，保证把公私合营工作做得又快又好，使得合营、生产两不误。
    中共上海市委第二书记陈丕显对工商界要求改造的积极性给予极大的鼓励，希望大家根据上海市的具体情况，很好地学习北京的榜样，胜利完成全市私营工商业的公私合营，把这一运动推向最高潮。
