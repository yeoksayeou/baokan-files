    Economic Contracts Must Be Strictly Fulfilled
    Zhang Pinxi
    Economic contracts, based on the state's material distribution plan and the mutual obligations undertaken by the supply and demand sides, bind suppliers and orderers together. They ensure the smooth implementation of product sales plans and material and technical supply plans, and guarantee the consolidation of economic accounting systems and the completion of production plans. Therefore, the correct execution of economic contracts is of great significance for the development and completion of the national economic Five-Year Plan.
    However, there are many problems in the execution of economic contracts by various production enterprises and basic construction units. The main problems are: failure to deliver goods within the time limit stipulated in the contract; product quality not meeting standards; requests for returns midway, and unreasonable contract terms.
    Failure to comply with contract discipline and delaying delivery times are the most common shortcomings. For example, last year, the Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory manufactured 27 items for the Dalian Shipyard, most of which were delayed by more than 130 days, forcing the Dalian Shipyard to temporarily purchase at high prices on the market to meet urgent needs. Various production enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building in the Northeast region ordered a lot of steel from the Ministry of Heavy Industry. However, some iron and steel enterprises neither delivered on time nor allowed returns, causing the various machinery factories to have an inventory of more than 12,000 tons of steel. Because failure to fulfill the responsibilities stipulated in the contract and arbitrarily delaying delivery times has become a common phenomenon, many orderers, in order to ensure production needs, clearly only need one ton of steel, but order two tons; clearly need it in August, but falsely claim they need it in April. This has resulted in unnecessary large reserves, preventing huge amounts of capital from circulating for a long time. More seriously, the failure of one enterprise to comply with the delivery deadline inevitably affects the production plan of another enterprise, or directly delays basic construction.
    Product quality not meeting standards is also a shortcoming that urgently needs to be overcome. For example, last year, the Tangshan Steel Plant supplied more than 1,300 tons of steel ingots to the Tianjin Vehicle Spring Factory, 8% of which had excessive sulfur and phosphorus content and could not be cold-drawn or forged. The 厶18 high-speed tool steel supplied by the Fushun Iron and Steel Company to the Harbin Tool Factory had severe center perforation and could not be used. One factory under the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry supplied 9,000 kilograms of copper rods to various enterprises in Shanghai under the First Ministry of Machine Building in 1954, most of which had defects such as scratches, hard injuries, scale, and bending. The 1,000 kilograms of copper pipes supplied had uneven wall thickness, with some tolerances exceeding the standards stipulated by the Ministry of Heavy Industry by more than four times. Various ordering units requested returns, but after repeated negotiations, the problem was not resolved, and the factory always refused to return the goods on the grounds of poor equipment conditions. By August last year, they even came up with the bizarre reason that "it has crossed the year, and it cannot be processed financially." These 10,000 kilograms of copper materials are still in inventory today.
    The ordering unit's lack of thorough planning and easy returns midway are major reasons for disrupting the production order of the supplying enterprises and making it difficult to complete the state plan. After revising its 1955 supply plan, the Dalian Crane Factory found that it had ordered too much high-quality carbon steel and immediately requested the Dalian Steel Plant to return 22 tons and the Benxi Iron and Steel Company to return 28 tons. Factory 438 under the First Ministry of Machine Building issued an official letter to 9 supplying units at the same time, requesting returns, stating that "due to changes in production tasks, the original ordered materials are no longer applicable." It should be pointed out that this attitude is incorrect. When production tasks change and some materials are surplus, the ordering unit should first study how to utilize these materials or make adjustments nearby. If it really cannot be resolved, it must also negotiate with the supplying enterprise, considering the various difficulties caused to the other party by the return. As for some units whose work is negligent and plans are wrong, they often use "changes in production plans" as a pretext to dishonestly fulfill the contract, which is of course even more unacceptable.
    The failure of balanced and adjusted materials is even more common. The planned adjustment of surplus materials exceeding the reserve amount in enterprises by the leading organs is a good way to handle backlog materials and explore potential resources. However, many units are very unserious about this work, the reported inventory figures are incorrect, the specifications and quality are unclear, and the adjustment contracts are not executed. For example, the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory originally decided to adjust 1,500 kilograms of high-quality carbon steel to the Jinan First Machine Tool Factory, but when it came time to deliver the goods, it suddenly stated that "due to changes in production tasks, this steel has been completely used up." The Tianjin Supply Office decided to adjust 10 tons of high-quality carbon steel to the Dalian General Machinery Factory, but there was no such material in the warehouse at all. The Shanghai Supply Office transferred a batch of high-quality carbon steel to the Wuhan Automobile Parts Factory, but after testing in the factory, it did not meet the standards and was shipped back to Shanghai, wasting freight. Because the adjustment contracts cannot be well implemented, the requesting units are not interested in stagnant materials. They would rather order from afar than accept nearby backlog materials. At present, our planning level is not high, our construction experience is insufficient, and there are many variable factors in the material demand plan, so backlog phenomena cannot be completely avoided. Therefore, it is necessary to organize exchanges and adjustments well to eliminate material stagnation. The prerequisite for doing a good job in balanced adjustment is to accurately grasp the quantity and quality of backlog materials.
    The terms of economic contracts should be based on the mutual obligations and jointly enjoyed rights of both parties. However, most enterprises' contracts are unreasonable. For example, the spot supply agreement of the Dalian Steel Plant stipulates that "if the supplier's warehouse has no goods, the demander shall be notified to cancel the contract within 15 days before delivery." Many units raised objections at the ordering meeting and were unwilling to accept this condition. Since the supplier is afraid that the warehouse has no goods, why insist on signing a spot agreement? Obviously, they don't know the inventory figures and are leaving a convenient way out for themselves. The supply contract of Anshan Iron and Steel also stipulates for itself that "the supplier will no longer be penalized after 30 days for failure to deliver on time." The Chongqing Iron and Steel Company stated in the contract that defective products can also not be delivered. These incomplete contract terms should be corrected immediately. In the Soviet Union, the signing of economic contracts is carried out according to the "basic supply conditions." The "basic supply conditions" for important products are approved by the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and other products are formulated by the various departments of the supplier after consultation with the orderer. The "basic supply conditions" point out the procedures for signing the contract, supply conditions and dates, product quality standards and acceptance methods, settlement of payment, and economic responsibilities to be borne for violating the contract. However, most of my country's economic contracts are drafted by the sales department itself, and there are many unreasonable aspects, which have lost the seriousness of the contract. In order to establish correct economic contract relations, it is necessary for the state material distribution organs and various sales departments to quickly formulate "basic supply conditions."
    Failure to act in accordance with the contract will inevitably lead to the disconnection of supply, production and sales. Therefore, the Soviet Union regards economic contracts as state laws. In order to improve the planning of supply, it is necessary to first change the blind practice of contracting orders. Before signing the contract, the supplying enterprise must carefully calculate its production capacity; after signing the contract, it must ensure timely supply. The ordering unit's ordering plan should also strive to be practical and reliable, and returns midway should be subject to economic penalties. Only in this way can we ensure the smooth realization of the plans of the various economic departments.

    必须严格履行经济合同
    张品西
    经济合同根据国家的物资分配计划，以供需双方互相承担的义务，把供货者同订货者结合在一起。它使产品销售计划和物资技术供应计划得以顺利实现，保证经济核算制的巩固和生产计划的完成。因而，正确地执行经济合同，对发展国民经济五年计划的完成，具有重要意义。
    但是，现在各个生产企业和基本建设单位在执行经济合同当中，有很多毛病。主要是：不按合同规定的期限交货；产品质量不合乎标准；中途要求退货和合同条款不合理。
    不遵守合同纪律，拖延交货时间，是最常见的缺点。如去年沈阳低压开关厂为大连造船公司制造的27项产品，大部分脱期130天以上，使得大连造船公司不得不临时到市场上出高价购买，以应急需。第一机械工业部在东北地区的各个生产企业，向重工业部订购了很多钢材。但是，有一些钢铁企业既不按期交货，又不允许退货，使得各个机械工厂积压了钢材12，000多吨。由于不履行合同中所规定的责任、随便拖延交货时间已经成为一种普遍现象，所以很多订货者为了保证生产需要，明明只用一吨钢材，却提出订两吨；明明是8月份用，却假说是4月份要用。这样就造成了不必要的大量储备，使巨额的资金长期不能周转。而更严重的是：一个企业不遵守交货期限，必然影响另一个企业的生产计划，或者直接耽误了基本建设。
    产品不合标准也是急待克服的缺点。例如去年唐山钢厂供应天津车辆弹簧厂的1，300多吨钢锭，有8％含硫磷过高，不能进行冷拔和锻造。抚顺钢铁公司供给哈尔滨工具厂的厶18高速工具钢，中心穿孔严重，不能使用。重工业部有色金属工业管理局所属的一个工厂在1954年给第一机械工业部上海各企业供应的9，000公斤铜棒，大部分有拉痕、硬伤、翘皮、弯曲等缺陷。供应的1，000公斤铜管，管壁厚度不匀，有的公差超过重工业部规定的标准四倍多。各个订货单位纷纷提出退货，但是经过多次交涉，问题也没有解决，这个工厂总是以设备条件不好等理由拒绝退货。到去年8月，又提出“已经跨年度，在财务上无法处理”的离奇原因。这1万公斤铜材，直到今天还在积压。
    订货单位的需要计划不周到，中途轻易退货，是打乱供货企业的生产秩序，使完成国家计划遭到困难的主要原因之一。大连起重机器厂修订了1955年供应计划以后，发现优质炭素钢订得过多，马上就向大连钢厂提出退货22吨，向本溪钢铁公司退订28吨。第一机械工业部所属的四三八厂以“因生产任务变更，原订物资已经不适用”的公函，同时向9个供货单位提出退货。应当指出，这种态度是不对的。当生产任务变更，某些材料有多余的时候，订货单位应该首先研究如何利用这些材料或就近调剂，真正不能解决，也须同供货企业协商，考虑对方因退货而引起的多种困难。至于有些单位因工作疏忽，计划错误，也常以“生产计划变更”为措词，不忠实地履行合同，当然是更加不能容许了。
    平衡调剂的材料落空更是普遍现象。企业中超过储备量的多余材料，由领导机关有计划地调剂，是处理积压物资、发掘潜在资源的良好办法。但是，许多单位对这项工作很不认真，所报的库存数字不正确，规格品质不清楚，签订了调剂合同不执行。例如南京机床厂原决定调剂给济南第一机床厂优质炭素钢1，500公斤，但是，到交货的时候突然提出“因生产任务变更，此项钢材已经全部用完”。天津供应办事处决定调剂给大连通用机器厂优质炭素钢10吨，可是仓库中根本没有这项材料。上海供应办事处调给武汉汽车配件厂一批优质炭素钢，运到厂内经化验不合标准，又运回上海，浪费了运费。由于调剂合同不能很好地实现，需要单位对呆滞材料不感兴趣。宁可到远地去订货，而不愿接受就近的积压材料。目前我们的计划水平不高，建设经验不足，物资的需要计划可变因素很多，积压现象不可能完全避免。因此必须很好地组织交流调剂，以消除材料的呆滞。而作好平衡调剂的先决条件，是正确掌握积压材料的数量和品质。
    经济合同的条款，应该以甲乙双方互相履行的义务和共同享有的权利为基础。但是大部分企业的合同不合理。如大连钢厂的现货供应协议书中规定：“如供方仓库无货的时候，于交货前15日内通知需方注销合同”。订货会议上很多单位提出异议，不愿接受这种条件。既然供方怕仓库无货，为什么硬要签订现货协议？显然对库存数字不摸底，为自己留一条方便之路。鞍钢的供货合同也给自己规定：“供方未按期交货，30天以后不再受罚款”。重庆钢铁公司在合同中说明，产生了废品也可以不交货。这种不照顾全面的合同条款应该立即纠正。在苏联，经济合同的签订，是按“基本供货条件”进行的。重要产品的“基本供货条件”由苏联部长会议批准，其他产品由供货者各部商得订货者同意后订定。“基本供货条件”指出签订合同的程序、供货条件和日期、产品质量标准和验收方法、货款的结算以及违反合同应负担的经济责任。而我国的经济合同多半是由销售部门自己拟定的，不合理的地方很多，失去了合同的严肃性。为了建立正确的经济合同关系，国家物资分配机关和各销售部门迅速制定“基本供货条件”实有必要。
    不按合同办事，必然会造成供产销的脱节。所以苏联把经济合同视同国家法律。为了提高供货的计划性，首先要改变盲目包揽订货的作风，供货企业在合同签订前要细致地核算自己的生产能力；合同签订以后，必须保证按时供应。订货单位的订货计划也应力求切实可靠，中途退货，应该受到经济上的处罚。只有这样，才能保证各个经济部门的计划得以顺利实现。
