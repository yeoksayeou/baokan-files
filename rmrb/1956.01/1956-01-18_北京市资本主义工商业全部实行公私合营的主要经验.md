The main experiences in implementing complete public-private partnership in Beijing's capitalist industry and commerce
    He Zuo

    Since the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee convened a meeting of party member cadres in mid-December of last year to discuss the work of further implementing the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, in less than a month, all capitalist industry and commerce in the city have implemented public-private partnerships and rapidly and smoothly completed the most complex work of asset inventory and verification within three to five days. Currently, they are undertaking economic restructuring and adjusting the commercial network.
    The reason why Beijing's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has progressed so rapidly is mainly due to the brilliance and correctness of the Party Central Committee's policies and guidelines, which have had a profound impact on the masses over the years. The superiority of our national system has provided a deep political foundation for further socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. In addition, since the second half of 1955, the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has entered a new stage of implementing public-private partnerships by industry.
    Through the public-private partnerships of nine industries in Beijing, some capitalists have further realized that only by combining their future with the future of the country can they have a bright future. In the work of the past few years, a group of core members who accept socialist transformation has grown up among some capitalists. At the same time, more and more activists have emerged in the industrial and commercial circles.
    In addition, the vast majority of capitalist industrial and commercial businesses in Beijing are small and medium-sized. The average net worth of each capitalist is only over 3,000 yuan, and their dividends and interest income are limited. Most people mainly rely on salary income for their livelihoods. They hope to have suitable work to do and are willing to accept transformation.
    The rapid progress of Beijing's capitalist transformation work is also inseparable from the following conditions. That is, the vast number of employees and shop assistants of private enterprises have formed a conscious, strong, united force that is a huge driving force for educating capitalists to accept socialist transformation. They have long yearned for the realization of public-private partnerships in enterprises. Great changes have also taken place within the families of capitalists. According to a typical survey conducted by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League in two neighborhoods, Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and Young Pioneers accounted for 27.6% of the members of these families. They often educate and encourage their families to actively take the socialist road. At the same time, in the work of the past few years, Beijing has accumulated experience in carrying out socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and has cultivated a group of cadres for the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. In addition, the arrival of the socialist upsurge of rapid development of agricultural cooperation in the suburbs of Beijing and the whole country has also had a great impetus and influence on capitalist industrialists and businessmen to accept socialist transformation. In this way, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in Beijing has truly formed a new situation of ripeness and natural success.
    After Chairman Mao's speech to the industrial and commercial circles in October of last year and the spirit of the Second Session of the First Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held in November were conveyed, the enthusiasm of private industrialists and businessmen in Beijing to accept socialist transformation was unprecedentedly high. Many capitalists worked day and night to prepare for the public-private partnership of the entire industry and could not wait to implement public-private partnerships quickly. Some elderly capitalists who had not participated in social activities for one or two years due to illness also participated in the Ninth Enlarged Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce. Many people who usually did not pay much attention to the business of their own factories and shops also took the initiative to brew private mergers of factories and shops and collectively applied for public-private partnerships. Many capitalists rushed to the trade association several times, eager to implement public-private partnerships as soon as possible. Many capitalists were urged by their wives, children, and relatives at home because they were not approved for partnership first. Some felt very dishonorable and even cried. Some capitalists also actively created conditions for public-private partnerships by taking out their own houses and assets outside the enterprise, funds that had been withdrawn in the past, off-the-books funds, valuable inventories, and gold and silver treasures buried underground for many years as new investments in the enterprise. According to incomplete statistics from the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, as of January 16, industrialists and businessmen in Beijing had requested a total of more than 4,100 rooms, more than 132,000 yuan in cash, and more than 1,000 catties of valuable medicinal materials to be invested in enterprises during the movement; the value of gold, silver dollars, and other properties has not yet been calculated. It is understood that the actual figures are much higher than this material. It has become a characteristic of this movement that industrialists and businessmen in Beijing use such unprecedentedly active practical actions to strive for partnership and strive for meritorious service. The socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of employees and shop assistants of private enterprises for the public-private partnership of the entire industry is even higher.
    In this case, a clear concept must be established in leadership thinking. That is, we must try our best to support and satisfy the enthusiasm and urgent demands of the masses to take the socialist road, thoroughly overcome the conservative thinking of cadres, break the rigid working methods, and make the organizational work in all aspects quickly catch up with the needs of the development of the objective situation. In order to fully support and satisfy the urgent desire of the masses to universally take the socialist road, the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee timely revised the original plan to basically complete the implementation of public-private partnerships in capitalist industry and commerce in 1956. And it mobilized and trained a large number of cadres. At the same time, the previous working methods were also changed. The previous practice of sending working groups, one industry at a time, and implementing public-private partnerships in batches and phases could no longer meet the current desire of the masses to quickly implement public-private partnerships. Therefore, the method of organizing capitalists, workers, and shop assistants to carry out the mass movement of public-private partnerships under the leadership of the Party and the government was adopted. That is, the establishment of public-private partnership working committees in various industries composed of professional companies, trade associations, and employee representatives to universally organize and promote the work of implementing public-private partnerships in various industries. At the same time, it was determined that under the unified leadership of the city, the city and districts should have a clear division of labor and be closely combined, and the districts also established public-private partnership working committees by industry to promote the rapid development of work by industry.
    In terms of work steps, in the past, the work of asset inventory and verification was generally carried out first, and then the partnership was approved. Now, public-private partnership is approved first, production and operation remain the same, and all employees remain unchanged; then, relying on workers, shop assistants, and capitalists, everyone brainstorms to carry out asset inventory and verification; the third step is to carry out economic restructuring and adjust the commercial network. The advantage of taking this approach is that it can guide the mass movement to a new climax, and the work progresses quickly, quickly and not chaotically. In just three days, January 8, 9, and 10, the implementation of public-private partnerships for all capitalist industrial and commercial households was approved continuously. Industrial and commercial capitalists expressed great satisfaction with the adoption of such a method. They said excitedly: "Every household hangs red to celebrate the partnership, gongs and drums are noisy, firecrackers are ringing, parades and flag dedications are grateful for the grace, and the Tiananmen Square is ecstatic all night."
    Approving the implementation of public-private partnerships in all industries is only the first step in the work of implementing public-private partnerships. It is necessary to immediately solve the key issue in the work of public-private partnerships, which is the issue of asset inventory and verification. In the past, the asset inventory and verification was to send working groups to each household and have the capitalists count and evaluate each item one by one. Doing so would take one or two months to complete even for general factories and shops. Now, thousands of private factories and shops are implementing public-private partnerships together. If the previous approach is used again, not only will there be insufficient manpower, but the time will be prolonged, which will inevitably affect production and operation. On the other hand, capitalists are also eager to quickly complete the work of public-private partnerships. Therefore, Beijing adopted the method of relying on employees and fully utilizing the enthusiasm of capitalists to take the socialist road. That is, the capitalists of each factory and shop themselves count, evaluate, and fill in the forms; the capitalists of the industry form an evaluation team to review each other, and finally the public-private partnership working committee of each industry verifies it. As a result of doing so, the counting and valuation work of various industries was basically completed in three to five days. Moreover, the funds reported by the vast majority of capitalists basically conform to the actual situation and meet the requirements of "fair, reasonable, and realistic." Even if the valuation of individual industrial and commercial households is too high or too low, appropriate adjustments have been made after the public-private partnership working committee of each industry has reviewed it.
    In the process of asset inventory and verification, the leading comrades of Beijing repeatedly explained the policies to employees and capitalists, requiring that the counting and valuation work must be done without duplication or omission, be realistic, and be fair and reasonable. They repeatedly called on employees to assist and supervise capitalists in doing this work; capitalists should actively strive to make contributions to socialism. And it was emphasized that the government entrusted the capitalists with the main responsibility for the work of asset inventory and verification. On the one hand, this is the government's trust in them, and on the other hand, it is a test of them. Many capitalists realized that they have a bright future after socialist transformation. The more good deeds they do for the people, the greater the rewards the people will give. At the same time, their main hope is that they can get appropriate work arrangements after the implementation of public-private partnerships. Therefore, they showed great enthusiasm in the counting and valuation work, competing to make contributions. In order to quickly complete this work, most capitalists worked night shifts, some even sleepless all night, moving things and raw materials together with the workers, and their emotions were very high. In particular, the heads of the Federation of Industry and Commerce and various trade associations, after finishing their work during the day, rushed to count and evaluate together with the workers at night. Young capitalists in Dongsi, Xidan, Xisi, Xuanwu and other districts successively organized "Youth Service Teams" to help public-private partnership households lacking manpower to count assets and fill in "Property Registration Forms". Capitalists and workers in many enterprises also came up with some good and fast methods. For example, in some commercial industries, some commodities are large in quantity and not expensive, and weighing is very troublesome. The capitalists and experienced workers jointly estimated the quantity based on the quantity of the year-end inventory and the sales situation after the inventory, which greatly improved the working speed. Capitalists in the three iron, binding and other industries in Qianmen District were divided into three groups: machinery, furniture, tools, and raw materials. They first carried out typical evaluation, and everyone had standards in their minds, and then they carried out evaluation separately. Many factories and shops in Xidan District adopted the method of counting and valuing at the same time, which not only saved time, but also made it easier to fit the actual situation to value facing the physical objects than to value facing the register. Rubber and other trade associations grouped by product type, and the capitalists of each household reported and evaluated each other; one or two households were first concentratedly evaluated as the standard, and the households with too high or too low were allowed to listen, and then they were re-evaluated, effectively correcting the phenomenon of being too high or too low.
    In the process of asset inventory and verification, the role of progressive core members was fully utilized. The counting and valuation work of each industry was first carried out by progressive core members who actively accepted socialist transformation, and they made an example of self-evaluation and self-reporting of the property of their enterprises based on the spirit of being realistic and fair and reasonable, so as to influence and drive others. This is an important guarantee for the smooth progress of the counting and valuation work.
    The rapid progress of Beijing's work on the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce fully proves that the Party Central Committee's policies and guidelines are brilliant, the Party's line is completely correct, and the backward and conservative thinking of some comrades who doubted the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen to accept socialist transformation has been completely overthrown.

    北京市资本主义工商业全部实行公私合营的主要经验
    何佐
    从去年12月中旬中共北京市委召开党员干部会议，讨论进一步对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的工作问题以后，不到1个月的时间，全市资本主义工商业就全部实行了公私合营，并在三、五天内迅速地、顺利地完成了合营工作中最复杂的清产核资工作。现在，正在着手进行经济改组和调整商业网的工作。
    北京市资本主义工商业社会主义改造工作所以能够这样快速地进展，主要是由于党中央的政策、方针的英明和正确，几年来在群众中已有很深的影响。我们国家制度的优越性，对资本主义工商业进一步进行社会主义改造，已有了深厚的政治基础。加之1955年下半年以来，国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造工作，已进入按行业实行公私合营的新阶段。
    北京市通过九个行业的公私合营，已使一部分资本家进一步认识到只有把自己的前途和国家的前途结合起来，才有光明的前途。在几年来的工作中，在一些资本家中已成长了一批接受社会主义改造的核心分子，同时，工商界中也出现了越来越多的积极分子。
    此外，北京市的资本主义工商业绝大多数是中小户，每个资本家的资产净值平均不过3，000多元，红利、股息收入有限，大多数人的生活主要是靠薪金收入。他们希望有合适的工作可做，愿意接受改造。
    北京市资本主义改造工作进展很快，也和以下的条件分不开。这就是广大私营企业的职工、店员，已组成了一支自觉的、坚强的、团结的、教育资本家接受社会主义改造的巨大动力，他们早已渴望着企业实现公私合营。在资本家的家庭内部，也起了巨大变化，据青年团北京市委员会在两个街道的典型调查，在29个资本家的家庭中，共产党员、青年团员和少年先锋队员就占这些家庭成员的27.6％，他们都经常教育、鼓励自己的家人积极走社会主义的道路。同时，在几年来的工作中，北京市已经积累了对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的经验，并培养了一批对资本主义工商业改造的干部。加上北京郊区和全国农业合作化迅速发展的社会主义高潮的到来，对资本主义工商业者接受社会主义改造也有巨大的推动和影响。这样，北京市对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造，就真正形成了瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成的新形势。
    去年10月毛主席对工商界的讲话和11月召开的中华全国工商业联合会第一届执行委员会第二次会议的精神传达以后，北京市私营工商业者接受社会主义改造的积极性更空前高涨。许多资本家连日连夜进行全行业公私合营的准备工作，迫不及待地要求迅速实行公私合营。有的年老带病一两年未参加社会活动的资本家，也参加了北京市工商业联合会执行委员会第九次扩大会议。许多平常不大关心本厂本店业务的人，也主动酝酿私私并厂、并店，集体申请公私合营。许多资本家争先恐后三番五次地到同业公会要求，急于早日实行公私合营。许多资本家因为没有首先被批准合营，回家后受到妻子儿女和亲友的督催，有的感到很不光彩，甚至哭闹一场。有些资本家还主动地把企业外的自有房屋、资产，过去抽逃的资金，帐外资金，贵重的存货，以及地下埋藏多年的金银财宝，拿来作为企业新的投资，积极为公私合营创造条件。根据北京市工商业联合会不完全的统计，到1月16日止，北京市工商业者在运动中，共计要求投入企业的资金有房屋4，100多间，现金132，000多元，贵重药材1，000多斤；黄金、银元和其它财物所值还未计算出来。据了解，实际数字比这个材料还要多得多。北京市工商业者用这种空前积极的实际行动来争取合营、争取立功，已经成为这次运动中的一个特点。广大私营企业的职工、店员要求全行业公私合营的社会主义积极性更为高涨。
    在这种情况下，领导思想上必须树立一种明确的观念。这就是必须尽量支持和满足群众走社会主义道路的积极性和迫切要求，彻底克服干部中间的保守思想，打破墨守成规的工作方法，使各方面的组织工作迅速地赶上客观形势发展的需要。中共北京市委员会为了充分支持和满足群众普遍要求走社会主义道路的迫切愿望，及时地修订了原订在1956年内基本上完成资本主义工商业实行公私合营的规划。并调集训练了大批干部。同时也改变了过去的工作方法。过去采取的那种派下工作组，一行一业，分批分期实行公私合营的作法，已经不能适应目前群众普遍要求迅速实行公私合营的愿望了，因此，采取了在党和政府的领导下，把资本家和工人、店员组织起来，进行公私合营的群众运动的办法。这就是，成立由专业公司、同业公会和职工代表组成的各行业公私合营工作委员会，普遍组织和推动各行各业按行业实行公私合营的工作。同时，确定了在市的统一领导下，市、区要有明确分工并密切结合，区也按行业成立了公私合营工作委员会，以推动工作按行业迅速开展起来。
    在工作步骤上，过去一般是首先进行清产核资工作，然后再批准合营，现在是首先批准公私合营，生产经营照旧，从业人员一律不动；然后再依靠工人、店员和资本家群策群力进行清产核资；第3步是进行经济改组和调整商业网的工作。采取这样做法的好处是可以把群众运动导向新的高潮，工作进展得快，快而不乱。仅仅在1月8、9、10日3天内，就连续批准了全部资本主义工商业户实行公私合营。工商业资本家对采取这样的办法表示十分满意，他们兴奋地说：“家家挂红庆合营，锣鼓喧天鞭炮鸣，游行献旗感恩惠，彻夜狂欢天安门。”
    批准各行各业全部实行公私合营，仅仅是实行公私合营工作的第一步，必须立即解决公私合营工作中的关键问题，就是清产核资问题。过去进行清产核资是一家一户地派工作组和资本家一件一件、一项一项地清点估价。这样做，一般的厂店也需要一两个月的时间才能做完。现在是成千上万的私营工厂、商店一起实行公私合营，如果再照过去的做法，不仅人力不足、而且时间拖长，势必影响生产和经营。另一方面，资本家也迫切要求迅速完成公私合营工作。因此，北京市采用了依靠职工、充分利用资本家要求走社会主义道路的积极性的办法。这就是由各厂各店资本家自己清点、自己估价、自己填报；由本行业资本家组成评议小组、互相审查，最后由各行业公私合营工作委员会核定的办法。这样做的结果，各行各业的清点估价工作在三、五天内就基本上全部完成了。而且，绝大多数资本家所报的资金基本上是符合实际情况的，达到了“公平合理、实事求是”的要求。即使个别工商户的估价有偏高偏低的现象，经过各行业公私合营工作委员会审查以后，也作了适当的调整。
    在清产核资过程中，北京市的领导同志曾向职工和资本家反复交待政策，要求清点估价工作一定要作到不重复不遗漏，实事求是，公平合理。一再号召职工要协助和监督资本家做好这项工作；资本家应积极争取为社会主义立功。并且强调说明政府把清产核资工作主要交给资本家负责，这一方面是政府对他们的信任，另一方面又是对他们的考验。很多资本家认识到社会主义改造以后他们有光明的前途，对人民做的好事越多，人民给的报酬也就越大。同时，他们的主要希望是实行公私合营以后能够得到适当的工作安排。因此，他们在清点估价工作中表现十分积极，竞相立功。大多数资本家为了迅速地完成这一工作，都打了夜班，有的甚至彻夜不眠，同工人一道，搬东西，搬原料，情绪非常高涨。特别是工商联和各同业公会的负责人，白天忙完了工作，晚上又同工人一道突击清点估价。东四、西单、西四、宣武等区的青年资本家，相继组织了“青年服务队”，帮助缺少人手的公私合营户清点资产和填写“财产登记表”。不少企业的资本家和工人还想出了一些又好又快的办法。比如在有些商业行业中，有的商品数量多，价格不贵，过秤很费事，就根据年终盘点数量和盘点后的销售情况，由资本家和有经验的工人共同估算，因此大大提高了工作速度。前门区三铁、装订等行业的资本家，分成机器、家具、工具、原材料等3组，先进行典型评议，大家心里有了标准，然后分头进行评议。西单区许多厂、店采用边清点、边估价的办法，不仅节省了时间，而且面对着实物估价比面对着清册估价更容易切合实际。橡胶等同业公会按产品类型分组，由各户资方自报互评；先集中评出一两户作标准，让过高过低的户旁听，然后使其重估，有效地纠正了偏高偏低现象。
    在清产核资过程中，充分发挥了进步核心分子的作用。每个行业的清点估价工作，都是首先由积极接受社会主义改造的进步核心分子，对自己企业的财产，根据实事求是公平合理的精神作出自估自报的榜样，以影响带动其他。这是顺利进行清点估价工作的重要保证。
    北京市对资本主义工商业改造工作的飞速进展的事实，充分地证明了党中央的方针、政策是英明的，党的路线是完全正确的，某些同志怀疑工商业资本家没有接受社会主义改造的积极性的落后保守思想，完全被打倒了。
