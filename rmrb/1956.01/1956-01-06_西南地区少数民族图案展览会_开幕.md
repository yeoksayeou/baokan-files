    "Southwest China National Minorities Pattern Exhibition" Opens
    The "Southwest China National Minorities Pattern Exhibition," sponsored by the Chinese Artists Association and the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, opened at the Capital Art Exhibition Hall on New Year's Day. The exhibits include embroidery, drawnwork, batik, and weaving patterns, as well as some clothing, from the Miao, Buyi, Yi, Tibetan, Dong, Dai, Nong, Jingpo, Yao, Kawa, Lisu, Shui, Minjia, Qiang, and Lahu nationalities, and the ?? people of Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces. The vast majority of the patterns on display were collected and copied by art workers in the southwestern region.
    The southwestern provinces of China are regions where various ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities. Although the exhibits displayed here are not yet comprehensive, one can already see the creative wisdom and art of the various ethnic groups.
    The exhibition is scheduled to close on January 22.
