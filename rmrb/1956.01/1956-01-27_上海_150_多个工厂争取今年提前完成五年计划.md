    Over 150 Factories in Shanghai Strive to Complete the Five-Year Plan Ahead of Schedule This Year

    157 state-owned and central joint state-private factories in Shanghai are all striving to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule this year. These factories are major factories in Shanghai's iron and steel, chemical, machinery, electrical appliances, textile, printing and dyeing, cigarette, food, pharmaceutical, and paper-making industries.

    This year, the speed of construction is accelerating throughout the country, and the high tide of agricultural cooperation has arrived, greatly increasing Shanghai's industrial production tasks. After repeated accounting and discussions, these hundred-plus factories have repeatedly discussed this year's production plan. The revised total output value plan for this year of more than 20 machinery and electrical appliance factories has increased by more than 38% compared to the original state plan. The output of some factories this year will increase by two or three times compared to last year. The production levels of more than 90 textile and printing and dyeing factories will all reach next year's targets this year. It is expected that a batch of factories in Shanghai will be able to complete the Five-Year Plan in the second quarter of this year. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    上海150多个工厂争取今年提前完成五年计划
    上海市有157个国营和中央公私合营工厂都争取在今年提前完成五年计划。这些工厂是上海钢铁、化工、机械、电器、纺织、印染、卷烟、食品、医药、造纸等行业中的主要工厂。
    今年全国各地加快建设速度，农业合作化高潮到来，大大加重了上海工业的生产任务。这一百多个工厂经过反复地核算和讨论，一再讨论了今年的生产计划。20几个机械、电器工厂屡次修改后的今年生产总值计划，比原来的国家计划增长38％以上。有些工厂今年的产量将比去年增长一倍或三倍以上。90多个纺织、印染工厂，今年的生产水平都能达到明年的指标。预计在今年第二季度，上海就有一批工厂可以完成五年计划。　（据新华社讯）
