　　Good Ways to Promote the Downward Flow of Industrial Products to the Countryside
　　Li Jixiang
　　With the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, how to supply industrial products to the countryside in a timely manner to support the cooperativization of agriculture and strengthen the links between industry and agriculture, and between cities and villages, has become a major issue that commercial departments at all levels must resolve. In 1955, state-owned commercial enterprises in Anhui Province set up wholesale organizations in the main market towns below the county seat, providing a solution to this problem.
　　More than 87% of the total population of Anhui Province are farmers. Therefore, the main task of state-owned commercial departments is to serve the countryside. Anhui Province has a large number of grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives and 160,000 private retailers. Most of them are scattered in market towns and rural areas below the county level. As long as they are well organized and utilized, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas will be greatly invigorated. However, more than a year ago, most of the wholesale organizations of state-owned commercial enterprises were located in cities far from the countryside. The rural supply and marketing cooperatives could not get timely supplies and did not have the strength to store large quantities of goods. Private merchants and peddlers in rural areas had little capital and operated alone, so they were even less able to transport industrial products from distant cities. Under these circumstances, there was a phenomenon that industrial products could not be sent to the countryside, agricultural products could not be purchased, farmers could not buy what they needed, private merchants and peddlers in rural areas had no place to purchase goods, their livelihoods were difficult to maintain, and the market could not be properly arranged.
　　In order to change this situation, in 1954, the party and government leading organs of Anhui Province required the supply and marketing cooperatives to quickly set up wholesale organizations in rural markets throughout the province. However, after efforts, only 50 wholesale points were set up by the end of the year, which could not meet the needs. In the spring of 1955, the leading organs of Anhui Province believed that if this situation was not quickly changed, it would seriously affect spring plowing and production. Therefore, during the Spring Festival, an emergency instruction was issued, requiring state-owned commercial departments to set up additional wholesale organizations in important rural market towns throughout the province and to start business in the shortest possible time. Because the party and government leading organs at all levels regarded this work as an important political task to be completed at that time, as well as the efforts of commercial workers and the cooperation of cooperatives, these wholesale organizations were quickly established. Experience over the past year has proved that this measure is completely correct, and it has the following benefits:
　　First, a strong commercial network centered on state-owned commercial wholesale organizations has been formed in the vast rural areas, transporting a large number of industrial products to the countryside and meeting the needs of farmers in terms of living and production after the bumper harvest in 1955. According to the estimates of 10 companies in the commercial system, the pre-ordered sales plan can be overfulfilled by 16% in 1955; it is estimated that the sales volume of industrial products in the fourth quarter of 1955 will increase by 83% compared with the same period in 1954. After the early rice harvest in southern Anhui, purchasing power increased greatly. The Huangmu distribution station in Nanling County had the highest sales volume, reaching more than 20,000 yuan per day. Because the inventory of the Huangmu wholesale organization was sufficient, it still guaranteed the market supply. In many places in northern Anhui, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives sold out their goods during the day, and went to nearby wholesale organizations to purchase goods overnight to ensure sufficient supply the next day.
　　Second, it is convenient for supply and marketing cooperatives and private merchants to purchase goods. Supply and marketing cooperatives and private merchants in Feidong County used to have to go to Hefei City to purchase goods, the quantity of goods purchased was small, the cost was high, and the time was long. Especially small merchants and peddlers, some only have a dozen yuan of capital, so they have to re-wholesale from small wholesalers on the spot, and their business is very difficult. After the establishment of wholesale organizations by state-owned commercial enterprises in important market towns, the farthest place to purchase goods is only 30 miles away. Small merchants and peddlers get up at five o'clock in the morning and can carry the goods back to sell at noon. In this way, the cost is smaller, the variety of goods is increased, the turnover is faster, and the profit is relatively increased. Because a large number of private merchants and peddlers share the task of promoting the sales of goods, the phenomenon of excessive crowding in cooperatives has also been eliminated.
　　Third, in the past, state-owned commercial enterprises did not directly connect with the rural market, did not fully understand the needs of farmers, and were very blind in compiling plans, and many unsalable goods were also transferred to the countryside. After the wholesale organizations extended to important market towns, they directly understood the needs of the countryside, thus gradually overcoming blindness. The variety of goods has also increased. In the past, grassroots cooperatives in rural areas generally only operated 200 to 300 kinds of industrial products, but now they generally have 500 to 600 kinds, and some reach 1,000 kinds.
　　Fourth, because state-owned commercial enterprises have established rural wholesale organizations, and there is a clear division of labor with supply and marketing cooperatives in business, the phenomenon of duplication, backlog or out-of-stock of goods caused by the purchase of goods by both state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives in the past has been avoided, and they can also supervise each other and do a good job in supplying the market. For example, some cooperatives are unwilling to operate some new commodities, and the wholesale organizations take the new commodities to the cooperatives for display. As a result, many people buy them, and the cooperatives purchase them in large quantities. Some commodities that are popular with the masses are not available in the wholesale organizations, and the cooperatives urge the wholesale organizations to organize the supply.
　　Fifth, the cost is reduced from the continuous expansion of commodity circulation, and the accumulation for the country is increased. After the establishment of wholesale organizations in rural market towns, the Anhui Province Department Store system paid more than four times more profits than in 1953 due to the expansion of commodity turnover and the reduction of costs. In addition, because wholesale organizations comprehensively operate kerosene, department stores, cotton cloth, prepared medicines, cultural goods, cigarettes, wine and other commodities, they can transport goods in whole trucks and whole ships, reducing transportation costs and reducing costs. Cooperatives and private merchants also greatly save transportation costs by purchasing goods near the commodity circulation route.
　　According to the experience of Anhui Province, the following points should be paid attention to when establishing state-owned commercial wholesale organizations in important market towns below the county level: 1. They should be established according to economic zoning and with appropriate consideration of administrative zoning and transportation conditions to facilitate leadership and commodity allocation. 2. The location should be arranged according to the commodity circulation route to facilitate the purchase of goods by small merchants and peddlers. The supply range of the wholesale station should not be too large or too small. Generally, it is better for a wholesale organization to supply one or two districts, and the supply mileage is more suitable at 30 miles. 3. Wholesale organizations should be comprehensive wholesale organizations for industrial products, which is convenient for private merchants and peddlers to purchase goods, and also convenient for transforming private merchants and peddlers. 4. The establishment of wholesale organizations should conform to the principle of economic accounting, and is generally more reasonable with four to six people.
　　Some people say that the extension of state-owned wholesale organizations to rural market towns has two shortcomings: one is that it is easy to disrupt the rural market and the transformation of private merchants; the other is that state-owned commercial enterprises have set up more wholesale organizations, the materials are scattered, and it is not easy to arrange, increasing backlogs and increasing bank interest. The experience of Anhui Province shows that the first concern is superfluous. Because private merchants and peddlers are arranged according to the direction of commodity circulation, their purchase locations are fixed, and their turnover is jointly reviewed by cooperatives and relevant departments (including state-owned commercial enterprises), and the cooperatives are responsible for controlling them. Therefore, the responsibilities and division of labor for the transformation of private merchants are very clear. The cooperatives are responsible for the transformation, and the state-owned wholesale organizations only help the cooperatives to carry out the work.
　　As for the second point, since the production of light industrial products is still concentrated in coastal areas, it takes a certain amount of time to allocate and distribute them. The extension of state-owned wholesale organizations to important market towns below the county level can allow them to plan the purchase, storage and transportation. In addition, industrial production is balanced throughout the year, while rural sales have peak and off seasons. The purchase of industrial products by state-owned commercial enterprises must be balanced throughout the year. Therefore, the nature of storing goods in a decentralized manner below and storing them in a centralized manner above is the same. Moreover, planned decentralized storage below can also avoid the situation of goods being out of stock during peak seasons.

　　推动工业品下乡的好办法
    李继祥
    在农业合作化高潮到来以后，如何把工业品及时供应到农村中去，以支援农业的合作化，加强工业同农业，城市同乡村的联系，便成为各级商业部门必须解决的一个重大问题。1955年，安徽省国营商业在县城以下的主要集镇设置批发机构，给解决这个问题提供了一个办法。
    安徽省的全部人口中，有87％以上是农民，所以，国营商业部门的主要任务，就是为农村服务。安徽省有大量的基层供销合作社和16万个私营零售商。它们绝大部分都分散在县以下的集镇和农村里。只要很好地组织和利用它们，就会使城乡的物资交流大大活跃起来。但是，一年多以前，国营商业的批发机构大半都设在离农村较远的城市里，而农村的供销合作社既得不到及时的供应，又没有力量储存大批物资；农村私商小贩资金少，单人匹马，更没有力量到很远的城市贩运工业品。在这种情况下，便产生了工业品下不了乡，农产品收不上来，农民需要的东西买不到，农村私商小贩无处进货，生活难以维持，市场不好安排的现象。
    为了改变这种情况，1954年，安徽省的党、政领导机关曾经要求供销合作社迅速在全省各地农村市场设置批发机构。但是，经过努力，到年底才设置了50个批发点，不能满足需要。1955年春天，安徽省的领导机关认为，如不迅速改变这种情况，就会严重影响春耕生产。于是，就在春节的时候发出了紧急指示，要求国营商业部门在全省重要农村集镇增设批发机构，并且在最短时间内开始营业。由于当时各级党、政领导机关都把这项工作当作一件重要的政治任务来完成，以及商业工作人员的努力和合作社的配合，这些批发机构很快就建立了起来。一年来的经验证明，这项措施是完全正确的，它有以下好处：
    第一、在广大的农村里组成了一个以国营商业批发机构为中心的强大商业网，运送了大批工业品下乡，满足了1955年大丰收后农民在生活上和生产上的需要。根据商业系统10个公司的预计，1955年可超额16％完成预订的销售计划；预计1955年第四季度的工业品销售数量比1954年同期增加83％。皖南地区早稻丰收后，购买力增加很大。南陵县的黄墓分销处销售额最高竟日销两万多元。因为黄墓批发机构的库存充足，仍然保证了市场的供应。淮北地区不少地方的基层供销合作社在白天把货卖光了，就连夜到附近批发机构去进货，保证了第二天充分供应。
    第二、便利了供销合作社和私商进货。肥东县的供销合作社和私商，过去都要到合肥市去进货，进货的数量小，费用大，时间长。特别是小商小贩，有的只有十几元本钱，只好就地向小批发商转批，经营很困难。国营商业在重要集镇建立批发机构以后，进货最远的也只有30里。小商贩五更起来，中午就可把货挑回来卖，这样，费用小了，商品花色增加了，周转快了，利润也相对增加了。因为有广大私商小贩分担了推销商品的任务，合作社过分拥挤的现象也消除了。
    第三、过去国营商业不直接连系农村市场，不完全了解农民需要，在编造计划时盲目性很大，把很多不适销的商品也调到了农村。批发机构下伸到重要集镇以后，直接了解了农村的需要，从而逐渐克服了盲目性。商品品种也增加了。过去农村基层合作社一般只经营二、三百种工业品，现在一般都有五、六百种，有的达到一千种。
    第四、由于国营商业建立了农村批发机构，并且和供销合作社在业务上有了明确的分工，避免了过去国营商业和合作社双方各自进货所造成的商品重复、积压或脱销现象，而且还可以相互督促，作好对市场的供应工作。如有的合作社不愿经营一些新商品，批发机构就把新商品拿到合作社去陈列，结果群众买的很多，合作社就大量进货了。有些为群众所欢迎的商品，批发机构没有，合作社就督促批发机构组织供应。
    第五、从不断扩大商品流通中降低了费用，为国家增加了积累。建立了农村集镇的批发机构以后，安徽省百货系统因为商品流转额的扩大和费用的降低，上缴利润比1953年增加四倍多。此外，因为批发机构综合经营煤油、百货、棉布、成药、文化用品、烟、酒等多种商品，就可以整车整船运输，减少了运费，降低了成本。合作社、私商由于按照商品流转路线就近进货，也大大节省了运费。
    根据安徽省的经验，要在县以下重要集镇建立国营商业批发机构，应该注意以下各点：一、应该根据经济区划，并且适当照顾行政区划、交通条件来建立，以便于领导和调运商品。二、设立地点应该按照商品流转路线，便于小商贩进货。批发站的供应范围，不宜过大，也不宜过小。一般情况下，一个批发机构供应一个到两个区为好，供应里程以30多里比较合适。三、批发机构应当是工业品综合性经营的批发组织，便于私商小贩进货，也便于改造私商小贩。四、批发机构的建立要符合经济核算的原则，一般以四人到六人比较合理。
    有人说，国营批发机构下伸到农村集镇，有两个缺点：一是容易搅乱农村市场，和对私商的改造工作；二是国营商业多设了批发机构，物资分散，不容易摆布，增加积压，多背银行利息。安徽省的经验证明，第一点顾虑是多余的。因为按照商品流转方向安排私商小贩，固定了他们的进货地点，而且，他们的营业额，都经过合作社及有关部门（包括国营商业）共同审核，由合作社负责掌握。所以，对私商改造的责任和分工十分明确，改造归合作社负责，国营批发机构只是帮助合作社进行工作。
    就第二点来说，由于目前轻工业品的生产还是集中在沿海地区，调运分配需要一定时间，国营批发机构下伸到县以下重要集镇，就可以有计划地采购储运，加上工业生产是全年均衡的，而农村销售则有淡旺季，国营商业对工业品的收购必须是全年均衡地收进才好。因此，商品分散到下面存储和集中在上面存储，其性质是一样的。而且，有计划地分散在下面存储，还可以避免旺季发生商品脱销的情况。
