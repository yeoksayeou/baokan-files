    Strange "Innovation"
    The leading personnel of the Party, Administration, Trade Union, and Communist Youth League organizations of the Tianjin Jinan Tannery held a meeting on New Year's Eve last year and decided to increase the production of balls in 1956 by 150% compared to the original plan, and the production of leather shoes by nearly 100% compared to the original plan... In this way, the output value in 1956 can be increased by 2.81 million yuan, and the tasks stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan can be completed ahead of schedule this year.
    This plan seems very advanced. However, the measures they proposed to guarantee the completion of this plan are not good. They have two methods: 1. Add machines; 2. Add people. Increase the number of workers in proportion to the increase in output. It is calculated that a total of 508 people need to be added.
    According to this measure, the labor productivity is calculated to be only more than 5,500 yuan per person per year, which is 3,200 yuan less than last year. That is to say, the national plan can be completed one year ahead of schedule, but the individual's production efficiency is reduced instead.
    This is truly a strange "innovation" of "completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule." We don't need such "innovations."
    What we require are advanced plans, and also advanced measures; we require "more and faster," and at the same time, we must also have "better and more economical"!

    奇怪的“创举”
    天津津南制革厂的党、行政、工会、青年团组织的领导人员，在去年除夕召开了一个会，决定1956年球类的产量要比原订计划提高一倍半；皮鞋的产量比原订计划提高近一倍……。这样，1956年的产值就可以增加281万元，第一个五年计划所规定的任务就可以提前在今年完成。
    这个计划看来是很先进的。但是，他们提出的保证完成这个计划的措施不妙。他们的办法有两条：一、添机器；二、添人。产量增加多少，就按比例增加多少工人。算下来，一共要增加508个人。
    按照这个措施来计算一下劳动生产率，每个人每年生产的价值只有5，500多元，比去年反而减少了3，200元。也就是说，国家计划可以提前一年完成，个人的生产效率反而降低了。
    这真是一个奇怪的“提前完成五年计划”的“创举”。我们不需要这样的“创举”。
    我们要求的是先进的计划，也要求先进的措施；要求“又多、又快”，同时也必须“又好、又省”！
