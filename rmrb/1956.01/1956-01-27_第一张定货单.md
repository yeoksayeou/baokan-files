    The First Order Form
    By Our Correspondent Ji Yin
    On the bank of the Huangpu River in Shanghai, there is a place called "Garbage Beach." It is a desolate wasteland, filled with a yellowish, moldy mixture of garbage and mud, overgrown with weeds and some crops. Only on the higher ground of the wasteland is there a row of houses, belonging to a shipbreaking company that has been idle for two years – the privately-owned Hongchang Shipping & Steel Company. Recently, this desolate "Garbage Beach" has suddenly become noisy. Rows of factory buildings have been built on the wasteland, and the sounds of various types of steelworking machinery roar day and night. Ship after ship sails from the beach into the Huangpu River. It turns out that a new shipyard has emerged here.
    This new factory is called the Joint State-Private New Shipbuilding and Repair Factory. It is a product of Shanghai's private industrial socialist transformation entering a new stage. The predecessor of this new shipyard was more than 20 small shipyards and other machine factories along the Huangpu River. In the past, some of these small factories specialized in repairing ships, some in dismantling them, and some, although capable of building small boats, faced extremely difficult production conditions. Some were supporting factories for shipbuilding, some had factory buildings but no workers, and some had capital but no factory buildings. For example, the Xinfa Electric Welding Factory, which participated in the joint venture, had only a small wooden boat as its entire asset. In the past, they would row this wooden boat along the Huangpu River looking for business, doing electric welding and repairs for others every day. In short, each factory was crippled, and none could independently manufacture new ships. In the second half of last year, Shanghai's private industrial socialist transformation entered a new stage of industry-wide joint ventures, and these small factories were also merged and transformed into joint state-private enterprises. To develop production, they concentrated the factories on this wasteland. The desolate "Garbage Beach" suddenly became the site of a sizable shipbuilding and repair factory. On the beach filled with garbage and mud, shipyard docks were built, and tall ship sheds were erected. A vibrant construction scene replaced the desolation of the past.
    The Joint State-Private New Shipbuilding and Repair Factory announced its establishment and immediately received its first order from the state: to build 10 iron barges with a cargo capacity of 550 tons each in three and a half months and deliver them to the Yangtze River shipping authorities. This order greatly encouraged all the workers and private representatives in the factory, because it showed the state's high trust and support for joint state-private enterprises. Such a large production task was unimaginable for those small private shipyards in the past. This first order was also a serious test for the enterprise. They had never made, or even seen, such new ships before, and now the time required was so tight that they had to build almost one ship every 11 days on average. What made it even more difficult was that the enterprise had only recently been merged and transformed, and normal order had not yet been established, and the workforce had not yet been well organized. But in order to meet the state's requirements, the state-appointed director of the New Shipbuilding and Repair Factory resolutely accepted the state's first order.
    This new factory launched its first enthusiastic labor competition, and workers in their workshops excitedly hung up the inspiring slogan: "We must run ahead of the plan!"
    This slogan first appeared in the factory's first process – the layout department. The workers, unfamiliar with the technology, delayed the layout task by five days, threatening the factory's entire production schedule. At this time, the 12 Youth League members in the layout department announced the formation of a shock brigade, and the workers in the layout workshop also joined in, voluntarily extending their working hours by two hours each day to accelerate progress. The five days of work were quickly made up, and they even ran ahead. After the layout department's work accelerated, the work of other workshops, such as copying, flame cutting, riveting, and hoisting, had to catch up, so workers in other workshops also formed shock brigades one after another. The labor competition unfolded throughout the factory, and the inspiring slogan "We must run ahead of the plan!" was hung in every corner of the factory. The Huangpu River bank was already dark, but it was still brightly lit here; the Huangpu River bank had not yet turned white, but the lights were already on here. The workers in the factory worked hard day and night like this, and many people became almost unrecognizable. Wang Songlin, a worker in the hoisting workshop, was a well-known troublemaker in the private factory, but now he has become a most active worker. He worked almost madly, working all day long, and when it came to the night shift, people found him again. When others got off work, he didn't leave, but wandered around the construction site, picking up discarded rivets from the ground, and salvaging floating pieces of wood from the river. In the hardest and dirtiest places, in the coldest night shifts, he could always be found. In the past, he would sleep during meetings, but now he couldn't stop talking during meetings, so much so that others had to interrupt him.
    People's thinking habits have changed, and the relationships between people have changed. In the past, master craftsmen in those private shipyards, in order to protect their livelihoods, would never openly teach their skills to young workers. Anyone who tried to steal a glance would be driven away. But now, the master craftsmen have fully shared their expertise. They taught classes in technical training sessions and provided concrete guidance in daily production. In a few dozen days, young workers learned shipbuilding techniques that used to take several years to learn. The ranks of young technicians grew rapidly. Young layout workers Ren Zhigang, Chen Haiquan, Zhu Defu, and others were still elementary students who didn't know how to do layout when they built the first ship, but by the time they produced the second and third ships, they had become small masters who could independently lead others in their work.
    The factory's technical equipment and labor protection conditions have also changed rapidly. In the past, the docks of these small shipyards had no work canopies. Whether it was raining or snowing, or in the sweltering heat, workers worked outdoors. Now, tall work canopies have been built over the docks of the new shipyard. Many heavy and unsafe manual labor tasks have begun to be replaced by machines. In the past, steel plates for shipbuilding in private shipyards were punched with holes manually, but now pneumatic drills are used. In the past, the furnaces in the flame cutting workshop for forging steel plates were ventilated by people pulling bellows, but now electric blowers have been installed. In the past, these small private shipyards used hand riveting. When the joint state-private enterprise was established, there were only six dilapidated riveting guns in total. Now there are dozens of new riveting guns, and the "da-da" sound of the riveting guns vibrates the entire dock day and night.
    Among the people working hard to complete the first state order are also the capitalists from the various private shipbuilding and repair factories. These capitalists have all been given suitable positions in the Joint State-Private New Shipbuilding and Repair Factory. Two have been appointed as deputy directors, others are responsible for departmental work, and some are directly involved in labor in the workshops. They are gradually transforming themselves through labor. When the layout workshop organized a shock brigade, they also participated. Zhuang Guoxiang, the person in charge of the production planning section, drew the hull curves and deck parts of the ship for the layout workshop. They often solve technical difficulties for various workshops. Most of these capitalists were originally contractors in the shipbuilding industry, but most of them understand shipbuilding technology. Now, their willingness to gradually abandon exploitation and actively transform themselves has been understood and welcomed by the workers. Their relationship with the workers has improved. The capitalists Zhou Weian and Zhou Wenzhong, who have been appointed as deputy directors, said that they laughed in their sleep when they thought of today's pleasant working life and the factory's rapid development.
    On the blackboard bulletin board at the entrance of the director's office, and in the broadcast from the factory's wired radio loudspeakers, all the changes in this new factory are expressed in numbers: the number of rivets hammered by one person per day has increased from an average of 300 in the past to 800, and some have reached 1,200; the number of flanges machined by a worker per day has increased from 800 in the past to 2,100; the number of holes punched by a copying worker per day has increased from 1,200 in the past to 1,900; the number of side plates laid out by layout workers has increased from two by three people in the past to five by one person per day; the number of longitudinal frames installed on the new ship's dock by hoisting workers has decreased from six people per team in the past to only three people now... In short, production records are not gradually increasing, but leaping forward.
    Since December 3rd of last year, five ships have been launched successively from the newly built dock at "Garbage Beach." The completion date of each ship is getting shorter and shorter, the quality is getting better and better, and the cost is getting lower and lower. The early completion of the first state order is in sight. The workers from the private factories in the new shipyard have thus used their liberated hands and their astonishing achievements in successfully completing the first order to once again prove to the people the truth that socialism is superior to capitalism.

    第一张定货单
    本报记者　季音
    在上海黄浦江边，有一块叫做“垃圾滩”的地方。这是一块荒芜的荒滩，堆满滩上的是一片暗黄色的发霉的垃圾和泥土，上面长满着茂密的野草，也种着一些庄稼。只有在荒滩的高处有一排房屋，这是一家已经有两年没有干活的拆船公司——私营鸿昌船务钢铁公司。最近以来，这座荒凉的“垃圾滩”突然变得喧闹起来，荒地上建起了一排排的厂房，日夜沸腾着各种钢铁的轰鸣，一艘又一艘的新船从滩边驶进了黄浦江。原来这里出现了一座新的造船厂。
    这座新工厂叫做公私合营新建船舶修造厂，它是上海私营工业社会主义改造进入了新阶段以后的一个产物。这座新造船厂的前身，是黄浦江边20多家小型船厂和其他机器厂。这些小型厂过去有的是专门修船的，有的是专门拆船的，有的虽能造些小船，但是生产条件极度困难，有的是配合造船的一些协作工厂，有的是有厂房没有工人，有的是有资金没有厂房。例如参加合营的新发电焊厂，全部家当就是一条小木船。过去他们驾着一只木船沿着黄浦江兜生意，每天给人家烧烧电焊，修修补补。总之，个个厂都是断腿缺胳膊，谁也不能单独制造出新船来。去年下半年，上海私营工业的社会主义改造进入了全行业合营的新阶段，这些小厂也实行了合并和公私合营。为了发展生产，他们把工厂集中到这片荒滩上。荒凉的“垃圾滩”，顿时成了一座规模不小的船舶修造工厂的所在地。堆满了垃圾和泥泞的滩头上，修起了造船厂的船坞，盖起了高高的船棚，生气勃勃的建设图景代替了往日的荒芜。
    公私合营新建船舶修造厂宣布成立，就接到了国家的第一张定货单：要他们在三个半月中造出10艘载货量550吨的铁驳船，送给长江航运部门。这张定货单使全厂职工和私方代表们感到极大的振奋，因为它表明国家对公私合营企业的高度信任和支持。像这样庞大的生产任务，过去在那些小私营船厂是无法想像的。这第一张定货单也是国家对企业的一个严重考验。这种新船他们过去从来没有做过，甚至看也没有看到过，而现在要求的时间又是这样急，几乎平均11天就要造出一条船来。更困难的是：企业才合并合营不久，正常秩序还没有建立，职工队伍还没有很好组织起来。但是为了满足国家的要求，新建船舶修造厂公股厂长终于坚决地接受了国家的第一张定货单。
    这个新工厂第一次展开了热烈的劳动竞赛，工人们在自己的车间里第一次兴奋地挂起了那激动人心的标语：“我们要跑在计划的前面！”
    这块标语牌，最先是在工厂的第一道工序——出样部门里出现的，工人们因为不熟悉技术，使出样任务推迟了五天，全厂的生产任务受到了威胁。这时候，出样部门的12个青年团员宣布成立突击队，出样车间的工人接着也全部参加，每天自动延长工作两小时来加速工作进度，五天的工作量很快补上了，且跑到前面去了。出样部门的工作加速以后，其他拷冲、火工、铆钉、起重等一系列车间的工作都得赶上去，于是其他车间的工人也纷纷组成了突击队，劳动竞赛在全厂展开了，“我们要跑在计划的前面”这句激动人心的标语，挂遍了全厂各个角落。黄浦江边早就天黑了，而这里还是一片通明；黄浦江边天还没有发白，这里灯光早就亮了，全厂工人们就这样不分日夜地猛干，多少人变得简直叫人不能认识了。起重车间工人王松林，在私营工厂里是有名的调皮鬼，现在成了一个最积极的工人，他简直像发狂似地工作着，白天干了一天，做夜班的时候，人们又发现了他，别人下班了，他不走，在工地上转来转去，从地上拾起丢下的铆钉，从江边捞起漂着的木片，在工作最苦最脏的地方，在天气最冷的夜班里，一定能够找到他；过去开会他睡觉，现在开会他的话说不完，以致别人不得不打断他的话。
    人们的思想习惯变化了，人和人的关系变化了。过去，那些私营造船厂的老师傅们为了维护自己的生活，决不肯把自己的技术公开地传授给青年工人，谁就是跑拢去偷看两眼也要被赶走。但是现在老师傅们把自己的拿手技术全盘托出来了，他们在技术学习班上教课，在日常生产中具体指导，青年工人在几十天时间中就学会了过去要几年才能学到的造船技术。青年技术队伍迅速成长了起来，青年出样工人任志刚、陈海泉、朱德福等人，在造第一条船的时候还是不会出样的小学生，到生产第二、第三条船的时候，他们已经变成能够单独带了别人做活的小师傅了。
    工厂的技术设备、劳动保护的状况也迅速改变了。过去这些小船厂的船坞里是没有工作篷的，无论是下雨落雪，或者是盛暑，工人们都在露天工作。现在新建船厂的船坞上盖起了高大的工作篷。许多繁重的、不安全的体力劳动，开始用机器来代替。过去私营船厂造船用的钢板是用人工来扳眼子的，现在已经改用风钻。过去火工车间锻冶钢板用的火炉是用人拉风箱送风的，现在装上了电动送风机。过去，这些私营小船厂都是用手铆铆钉的，公私合营的时候，一共只有六根破旧不堪的铆钉枪，现在已经有了数十根新铆钉枪，“哒哒”的铆钉枪声，日夜震动整个船坞。
    为完成第一张国家定货单而紧张工作着的人群中，也有各私营船舶修造厂的资本家。这些资本家们在公私合营新建船舶修造厂里都得到了合适的岗位，两个担任了副厂长，其余负责科室工作，有的则直接在车间里参加劳动。他们在劳动中逐步改造自己。当出样车间组织了突击队以后，他们也都参加了突击队。担任生产计划科负责人的庄国祥为出样车间画了船体曲线和船的甲板部分。他们经常为各车间解决技术上的困难。这些资本家过去大都是造船行业的包工头出身，但是大部分人都懂得造船技术。现在他们这种愿意逐步放弃剥削、积极改造自己的表现，得到了工人的谅解和欢迎，他们和工人的关系改善了，担任了副厂长的资本家周维安、周文忠说，想到今天这种愉快的劳动生活，工厂这种一日千里的发展，在睡梦里都笑出声来了。
    在厂长室门口的黑板报上，在工厂的有线广播喇叭的广播声中，这个新工厂的一切变化都用数目字表现了出来：铆钉由过去一个人一天平均打300只提高到800只，有的达到1，200只，法眼工由过去一天法800只提高到法2，100只；拷冲工人由过去一天打眼1，200只提高到1，900只；出样工人由过去三个人抹两张傍板，提高到一天抹五张；起重工过去在新船船坞上排楞头要六个人一挡，现在只要三个人……总之，生产记录不是在逐步提高，而是在飞跃地提高。
    从去年12月3日开始，“垃圾滩”边新修的船坞里，已经先后有五艘船下水了。每艘船的完成日期愈缩愈短，质量越来越好，成本愈降愈低，第一张国家定货单的提前完成已经在望了。新建船厂里这些来自私营工厂的全体工人们，就是这样地用他们解放了的双手，用他们顺利完成第一张定货单的惊人成就，再一次向人们证明了社会主义优于资本主义的真理。
