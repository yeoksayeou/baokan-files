Respected Comrade Chairman of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany:
Respected Comrades and Friends:

All members of our delegation of the People's Republic of China are honored to have participated in the celebration of the 80th birthday of Comrade Wilhelm Pieck, the leader beloved by the German people and an outstanding fighter of the international workers' movement, and are pleased to have had the opportunity to visit some famous factories, agricultural production cooperatives, machine tractor stations, cultural institutions, and cities in the German Democratic Republic that have achieved great success in socialist construction. The warm and thoughtful reception we received during our stay in the German Democratic Republic fully demonstrated the deep brotherly friendship of the German people towards the Chinese people.

Respected Comrades and Friends, we believe that the unbreakable brotherly friendship between our two peoples in the great family of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will continue to consolidate and develop. The close cooperation between our two fraternal countries will expand and fully develop on the basis of the recently signed historic Sino-German Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, thereby making even greater contributions to the cause of international peace and human progress.

We have personally seen the Germany of Marx and Engels, Luxemburg and Liebknecht, Thälmann and Pieck, the Germany with a long revolutionary tradition and whose working people have made outstanding contributions to all mankind in industrial production, science and technology, and culture and art, and the first worker-peasant state in German history that has completely eradicated militarism, and we are extremely excited and admire the great achievements it has made in socialist construction.

Respected Comrades and Friends, we have every reason to believe that the people of the German Democratic Republic, under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and President Wilhelm Pieck, will achieve even greater success in the cause of socialist construction in the future. The future belongs to the working people. The historical task of the entire German people to strive for the unification of their country on the basis of peace and democracy will surely be accomplished victoriously.

Now, as we bid farewell to you, please allow me to once again extend to you, and through you to the German people and the aged President Wilhelm Pieck, brotherly and warm respects and greetings.

Long live the German Democratic Republic!
Long live the brother friendship between the Chinese and German peoples!
Long live the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Kollens then delivered a farewell speech, saying: Marshal Zhu De came to the German Democratic Republic to convey the congratulations of the 600 million Chinese people to our beloved President Pieck on his 80th birthday. This visit is a great honor for our German Democratic Republic and for the entire German people.

Kollens expressed heartfelt thanks to Vice Chairman Zhu De and all members of the delegation.

Kollens said that the German people recognize that the Chinese people are their strong and faithful friends, and this recognition has become deeper and more solid after Marshal Zhu De's visit.

Kollens asked the delegation to convey the sincere respect of the German people to the Chinese people and government.

Zhu De walked onto the platform amidst the applause of the farewell crowd. He cordially shook hands with Prime Minister Grotewohl repeatedly to say goodbye and said "Goodbye" in German to all those seeing him off.

At exactly 1:00 PM, the special train slowly pulled out of Berlin station.
