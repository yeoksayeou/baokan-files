Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 7th: The workers constructing the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant plan to complete this modern factory one and a half years ahead of schedule. Considering the current development and needs of national construction, they have revised the overall progress of the plant construction project, changing the original plan of two phases into one. They will adopt highly mechanized construction methods to advance and shorten the construction period of many projects.

　　The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant is one of the key construction projects of the Five-Year Plan. Its early completion will not only improve the manufacturing level of the machinery industry, but the heavy machine tools it produces can also equip many domestic machine manufacturing plants ahead of schedule.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, January 8th: The Wuhan Thermal Power Plant, which is currently under construction, has decided to strive for early completion. According to the new plan, the construction time of this large-scale and technologically complex thermal power plant will be shortened significantly compared to the original plan. All 23 major projects of this plant will be under full-scale construction starting from the first quarter of this year. The Wuhan Thermal Power Plant and the construction units have mutually proposed guarantee conditions.

　　武汉重型工具机厂将提前建成
    武汉热电站争取提前完工
    据新华社武汉7日电　建设武汉重型工具机厂的职工，计划提前一年半把这座现代化的工厂建成。考虑到目前国家建设的发展和需要，他们已经修订了建厂工程的总进度，把原来分为两期建设的计划改为一期进行，他们将采用高度机械化的施工方法，使许多工程的工期都提前和缩短。
    武汉重型工具机厂是五年计划重点建设工程之一。它的提前建成，不但可以提高机械工业的制造水平，而且它生产出来的重型工具机还能把国内许多机器制造厂提前装备起来。
    据新华社武汉8日电　正在兴建的武汉热电站决定争取提前完工。根据新的计划，这座规模巨大、技术复杂的火力发电站的建设时间比原计划缩短许多。这个厂的23项主要工程，从今年第一季度起都要全面施工。武汉热电站和施工单位互相提出了保证条件。
