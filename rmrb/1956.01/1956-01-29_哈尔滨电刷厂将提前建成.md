Harbin Electric Brush Factory to be Completed Ahead of Schedule

The entire staff of the Harbin Electric Brush Factory, which is currently under construction, is actively engaged in a labor emulation campaign to strive to complete the factory construction task one year and three months ahead of schedule.

In order to guarantee the early completion of the factory construction task, the Party organization and administrative leadership of the electric brush factory have successively organized all employees to examine and criticize right-leaning conservative thinking and have compiled detailed construction projects for this year. According to the factory's third compiled 1956 capital construction project, there are more than 40 additional projects compared to the first compiled plan, and most of these projects are cross-year projects for 1957. In order to complete the task ahead of schedule, these projects must all be completed in the third and fourth quarters of this year and immediately installed.

    哈尔滨电刷厂将提前建成
    正在建设中的哈尔滨电刷厂的全体职工，正积极开展劳动竞赛，争取提前一年零三个月完成建厂任务。
    电刷厂的党组织和行政领导，为了保证提前完成建厂任务，先后组织了全体职工检查和批判了右倾保守思想，并详细地编制了今年的建设项目。按照这个厂第三次编制的1956年基本建设项目，比第一次编制的计划增多40多项，这些项目大部是1957年跨年度的工程。为了提前完成任务，这些项目要在今年第三季度和第四季度全部建设完毕，并立即进行安装。
