Currently, officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army are enthusiastically donating money to establish "Volunteer Army Tractor Stations" to support the motherland's agricultural cooperativization. Many units have received large donations from officers and soldiers within a few days.

Volunteer Army troops stationed in a certain area donated more than 22,240 yuan; engineering units donated more than 5,300 yuan in five days; and officers and soldiers of a certain artillery unit donated more than 300 yuan in half an hour. Ji Hongmin, a cook in a certain unit, donated 20 yuan of his savings, saying, "Everyone is responsible for loving the country. It is good for me to save a little and add a brick to the construction of the motherland." Officers and soldiers recuperating in various unit hospitals also actively donated money. Many officers and soldiers said: We are far away from the motherland and cannot personally participate in the socialist construction of the motherland. Donating some pocket money to support the motherland is our way of expressing our feelings.
    In addition, the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army also use other methods to support the socialist construction of the motherland, such as purchasing new agricultural tools to give to agricultural production cooperatives, and giving books and recreational supplies to agricultural production cooperatives. Many troops have also launched a thrift campaign to support the socialist construction of the motherland.

    支援祖国农业合作化事业
    志愿军捐款建拖拉机站
    据新华社平壤27日电　目前，中国人民志愿军官兵正热烈捐款建立“志愿军拖拉机站”，以支援祖国农业合作化事业。许多单位在几天内，就收到了官兵们的大批捐款。据统计，到24日止，志愿军领导机关的官兵已经捐款8，678.5元。驻某地区的志愿军部队，捐款达22，240多元；工程兵各部队在五天内就捐了5，300多元；炮兵部队某部的官兵在半小时内就捐了300多元。某部炊事兵纪红民捐出了自己积存的20元，他说：“爱国人人有责，我节省点给祖国建设增加一块砖也是好的。”正在各部队医院内休养的军官和士兵们，也踊跃地捐了款。许多军官和士兵都说：我们远离祖国，不能亲自参加祖国的社会主义建设，捐点零用钱支援祖国，也算尽我们的心意。
    此外，中国人民志愿军广大官兵还用其他方法支援祖国社会主义建设。如购置新式农具赠给家乡的农业生产合作社，赠给农业生产合作社图书和文娱用品等。许多部队还掀起节约运动，支援祖国的社会主义建设。
