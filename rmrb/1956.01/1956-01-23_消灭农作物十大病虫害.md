Eliminate the Ten Major Pests and Diseases of Crops

Completely eliminating crop pests and diseases is an important measure to ensure increased agricultural production. According to rough estimates, throughout the country, pests and diseases cause an annual reduction of approximately 10% in grain production, over 20% in cotton production, and approximately 40% in fruit production. From this, one can see how urgent and important it is to completely eliminate pests and diseases!

Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the vast number of farmers in our country have waged a resolute struggle against pests and diseases in recent years and have achieved great success. In areas where serious pests and diseases occurred, during certain periods, in order to "seize grain from the mouths of insects," a true "nationwide mobilization" was achieved. The locust plague, which has plagued the country for over two thousand years according to historical records, has been brought under control by the people; the damage from rice stem borers has been reduced year by year; the scope of cotton aphid damage is getting smaller and smaller; and the spread of other pests and diseases has also been suppressed. However, all pests and diseases remain fierce enemies of crops. To ensure bumper harvests every year, it is necessary to take urgent measures to completely eliminate the ten major pests and diseases of crops that cause serious damage nationwide within the next seven years, including rice stem borers, flying locusts, cotton bollworms, cotton aphids, cotton red spiders, armyworms, corn borers, sweet potato black rot, wheat smut, and wheat nematode disease, as well as various regional serious pests and diseases.

Eliminating the ten major pests and diseases in seven years is something our ancestors dared not imagine. We must rely on the strength of agricultural collectivization and national industrialization to strive to complete this task in the shortest possible time.

To completely eliminate pests and diseases, it is necessary to carry out the work simultaneously and collectively under a unified command. This was not easy to do in the era of small-scale farming. Now, most areas of the country have realized semi-socialist agricultural collectivization, and perhaps it will not be long before the transition to complete socialist collectivization can be achieved. Farmers are universally organized, and fighting pests and diseases in a planned way within a county, a province, or even the whole country, no matter how "stubborn" the enemy is, we will completely eliminate them. To eliminate crop pests and diseases, it is also necessary to have sufficient manpower and funds. Individual farmers cannot concentrate such sufficient manpower and funds. After the realization of agricultural collectivization, this problem will be completely solved. Last year, more than 1.5 million mu of farmland in the Yuebei area of Guangdong Province suffered from insect pests, and the situation was very serious. The Yuebei District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party mobilized more than 1 million people in a few days to completely eliminate the insect pests. This was before the complete realization of agricultural collectivization, and things will be much easier after the complete realization of agricultural collectivization.

Completely eliminating crop pests and diseases also requires a large amount of pesticides and machinery. Numerous experiences have proven that using pesticides and machinery to kill pests is the most effective method. With the development of national industrial construction, the supply of pesticides and machinery is increasing year by year. From 1950 to 1955, the state supplied 167,000 tons of finished pesticides and 1.22 million sprayers and dusters; and in 1956 alone, it will supply about 500,000 tons of finished pesticides and 3.5 million sprayers and dusters. Of course, the current national supply of pesticides and machinery still cannot keep up with the actual needs, so we should give full play to the effectiveness of existing pesticides and machinery and try our best to avoid any waste; at the same time, we should make full use of locally produced native medicines and pest control equipment created by the masses.

In the long-term struggle against crop pests and diseases, farmers in our country have accumulated extremely rich experience. They not only know how to use various medicines and machinery to prevent and eliminate pests and diseases, but also are good at using various artificial and other methods to eradicate pests and diseases. Numerous serious locust plagues in Chinese history were eradicated by artificial methods, demonstrating the high wisdom of the vast number of farmers. We must help farmers summarize these experiences, adapt them to local conditions, and widely promote them to supplement the shortcomings of modern pesticides and machinery.

For several years, the work of preventing and controlling pests and diseases has been carried out under the slogan of "early treatment, comprehensive treatment, and thorough treatment." To eliminate the ten major pests and diseases within seven years, we must turn this slogan into a reality throughout the country. If an overwintering stem borer is not eliminated, it may reproduce tens of thousands to millions in four or five months. Doesn't this most powerfully illustrate the necessity of early prevention and control? In many rice-producing areas in the south, the practice of universally and thoroughly digging up rice roots and clearing weeds before spring plowing for three consecutive years to eliminate overwintering stem borers has reduced the rate of stem borer damage from more than 10% to 1 or 2 per thousand. Doesn't this best illustrate the effect of early, comprehensive, and thorough pest control? Some people still have a侥幸 psychological (feeling of侥幸 luck and avoiding problems) in the matter of preventing and controlling pests and diseases, and always wait until the pests and diseases are serious before taking action, which often leads to being passive, wasting effort and time, and causing major disasters. This practice must be resolutely changed.

To eradicate pests and diseases as soon as possible, it is also necessary to further develop the forecasting and reporting of crop pests and diseases and plant quarantine work. Implementing crop pest and disease forecasting and reporting can predetermine the areas, times, and development trends of pest and disease outbreaks, so as to formulate prevention and control plans in a timely manner and organize the masses to eradicate them. Implementing plant quarantine can seal off epidemic areas, eliminate pests and diseases occurring in local areas, protect areas where pests and diseases have not yet occurred, and prevent dangerous pests, diseases, and weeds from spreading outward with plants and their products. This year, 118 forecasting and reporting stations, 4,000 to 5,000 pest and disease information points, and 120 quarantine grassroots stations will be established throughout the country, and they must be completely built well.

Currently, all regions are carrying out the work of formulating production plans, and the work of periodically eliminating the ten major crop pests and diseases should be listed as an important part of the production plan. Many regions attach great importance to measures such as building farmland water conservancy, accumulating fertilizer, and changing farming systems in production plans to tap the potential for increasing production, which is very correct. However, individual regions have neglected or relaxed measures to prevent and control crop pests and diseases, which is not correct. Last year, in some rice-producing areas in the south, in order to increase grain production, single-season rice was changed to double-season rice; however, due to the serious damage caused by the rice stem borer, the late rice of double-season rice in some fields was greatly reduced, and the total income was not as much as single-season rice. This fact fully illustrates that if the work of preventing and controlling crop pests and diseases is ignored, it is impossible to complete the task of increasing agricultural production ahead of schedule and beyond the target. All regions should formulate plans to eliminate pests and diseases more actively and progressively according to specific conditions. Some regions have already proposed to complete the plan to eliminate local major crop pests in four years, three years earlier. This working spirit and practice of fully utilizing favorable factors, bravely overcoming difficulties, and advancing by leaps and bounds is worthy of learning and promotion.

For most parts of the country, there are still three or four months before spring plowing. All regions should make good use of this period to establish and improve plant protection institutions, formulate specific plans for preventing and controlling pests and diseases, eliminate overwintering pests, prepare for the disinfection of spring sowing seeds, organize sources of pesticides, repair pest control equipment, summarize the experience of the masses in pest control, and impart prevention and control techniques. We must do these tasks well to ensure that we are prepared to fight the first battle in the major offensive against the ten major crop pests and diseases.

### 消灭农作物十大病虫害

    消灭农作物十大病虫害
    彻底消灭农作物的病虫害，是保证农业增产的一项重要措施。根据粗略的估计，在全国范围内，由于病虫害，每年粮食大约减产10％，棉花大约减产20％以上，果品大约减产40％。从这里，人们可以看到彻底消灭病虫害是多么迫切、多么重要的事情！
    我国广大农民，在党和政府领导下，几年来同病虫害进行坚决的斗争，取得很大的成绩。在发生严重病虫害的地区，在一定时期以内，为了“从虫子嘴里夺回粮食”，真正作到了“全民动员”的地步。自有历史记载以来为害两千多年的蝗灾已被人民控制住了；稻螟虫的灾害逐年减轻；棉蚜为害的范围越来越小；别的病虫害的蔓延也受到抑制。但是，一切病虫害仍然是农作物的凶恶敌人。为了保证农业每年丰产，必须采取紧要的措施，在今后七年以内，把全国范围内为害严重的水稻螟虫、飞蝗、棉花红铃虫、棉蚜、棉红蜘蛛、粘虫、玉米螟、甘薯黑斑病、麦类黑穗病、小麦线虫病等农作物的十大病虫害，和各种地区性的严重病虫害，彻底加以消灭。
    七年消灭十大病虫害，这是我们的先人所不敢想像的事情。我们要依靠农业合作化和国家工业化的力量，争取用最短的时间完成这个任务。
    为了彻底消灭病虫害，必须在统一的号令之下，同时进行，一齐动手。这是在小农经济时代所不容易办到的。现在，全国大部地区实现了半社会主义的农业合作化，也许不要很长的时间，就可以过渡到完全社会主义合作化。农民普遍地组织起来，在一县、一省以至全国范围内，有计划地同病虫害作斗争，不管多么“顽强”的敌人，也会被我们完全消灭。要想消灭农作物的病虫害，还必须有相当充裕的人力和资金。个体农民不可能集中起这样充裕的人力和资金。实现农业合作化以后，这个问题就完全解决了。去年广东粤北地区有150多万亩农田发生虫害，情况非常严重。中共粤北区党委在几天的时间内，动员了100多万人，彻底消灭了虫害。这还是没有完全实现农业合作化以前的情况，完全实现农业合作化以后，事情就更要好办得多了。
    彻底消灭农作物病虫害，还需要大量的农药、药械。无数经验证明，用农药、药械杀灭害虫是最有效的办法。随着国家工业建设的发展，农药、药械的供应逐年增加。从1950年到1955年，国家供应的农药成品有167，000吨，喷雾器和喷粉器122万架；而在1956年一年，就将供应农药成品50万吨左右，喷雾器和喷粉器350万架。当然，目前国家对农药、药械的供应还赶不上实际的需要，这就应该充分发挥现有农药、药械的效能，极力避免任何浪费；同时应该尽量利用当地生产的土药和群众创造的治虫器械。
    我国农民在同农作物病虫害进行长期斗争中，积累了极为丰富的经验，不仅会用各种药械防治和消灭病虫害，而且善于运用各种人工的和其他方法扑灭病虫害。我国历史上无数次严重的蝗灾，就是用人工方法扑灭的，表现了广大农民的高度智慧。我们要帮助农民把这些经验总结起来，因地制宜，广泛地加以提倡，以补助现代农药、药械的不足。
    几年以来，防治病虫害的工作是在“及早治、全面治、彻底治”的口号下进行的。为了在七年以内，消灭十大病虫害，必须在全国范围内使这个口号变成事实。一个越冬螟虫如果不被消灭，经过四、五个月，就可能繁殖几万个到几百万个，这难道不是最有力地说明了及早防治的必要吗？南方有不少稻产区，连续三年在春耕以前普遍地、彻底地掘毁稻根，清除杂草，消灭越冬螟虫，已经把螟害率从百分之十几减少到千分之一、二，这难道不是最好地说明了及早、全面、彻底除治害虫的效果吗？有些人在防治病虫害的问题上还有一种侥幸心理，总是等到病虫害严重了才去除治，以致经常陷于被动，费力费时，造成重大祸害。这种作法必须坚决加以改变。
    为了早日扑灭病虫害，还必须进一步开展农作物病虫害预测预报工作和植物检疫工作。实行农作物病虫害预测预报，可以预先测定病虫害发生的地区、时期和发展趋势，以便根据这种情况，及时制定防治计划，组织群众加以扑灭。实行植物检疫，可以封锁疫区，肃清局部地区发生的病虫害，保护尚未发生病虫的地区，并且阻止危险病虫杂草随着植物及其产品向外传播。今年全国将建立118个预测预报站，四、五千个病虫情报点和120个检疫基层站，必须把它们完全搞好。
    目前各地都在进行制定生产规划的工作，应该把定期消灭农作物十大病虫害的工作，列为生产规划的一个重要内容。许多地区在生产规划中，很重视从兴修农田水利、积肥、改变耕作制等挖掘增产潜力的措施，这是很对的。但是，个别地区忽略了或者放松了防治农作物病虫害的措施，这就不对了。去年南方有些稻产区，为了增产粮食，改单季稻为双季稻；但是由于三化螟严重为害，有些田里双季稻的晚稻大大减产，总收入还不如单季稻多。这个事实充分说明，如果忽视防治农作物病虫害的工作，要想提前超额完成农业增产任务是不可能的。各地应该根据具体条件，把消灭病虫害的计划定得更积极、更先进些。有的地区已经提出了提早三年的时间，即在四年以内完成消灭当地主要农作物害虫的计划。这种充分利用有利因素，勇敢克服困难，大步前进的工作精神和作法，值得学习和推广。
    就全国大部地区来说，目前距春耕还有三、四个月。各地应该很好地利用这一段时间，建立和健全植物保护机构，制定防治病虫害的具体计划，除治越冬害虫，为春播种子消毒工作作好准备，组织农药货源，修理治虫器械，总结群众治虫经验，传授防治技术。一定要做好这些工作，保证在向农作物十大病虫害大举进攻中，有准备地打好第一仗。
