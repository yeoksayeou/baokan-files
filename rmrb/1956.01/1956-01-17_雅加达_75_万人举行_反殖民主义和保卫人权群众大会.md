Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 16th: On the morning of January 15th, a "Mass Rally Against Colonialism and Defending Human Rights" was held at Independence Square in Jakarta, with 750,000 people participating.

From early morning, crowds poured into the square from all corners of the city. People came to the rally carrying countless red and white flags (the Indonesian national flag) and banners with slogans. These slogans were: "Immediately Stop Negotiations with the Netherlands," "Recover West Irian According to the Resolutions of the All-Indonesia People's Congress," "Immediately Dissolve the Burhanuddin Harahap Cabinet," "Form a Progressive National United Cabinet," "Immediately Establish a New Parliament," "Crush the Islamic State Movement and the Indonesian Islamic Army."

Aruji Kartawinata, Chairman of the All-Indonesia People's Congress and Chairman of the Indonesian Islamic Union Party, spoke first at the meeting, saying that the Republic of Indonesia belongs to all the Indonesian people and not to any one group. Any group that does not want unity is selfish. He also said: "Only when people from all walks of life, including Marxists, nationalists, and Muslims, unite can we eliminate the remaining forces of the Netherlands and crush colonial rule."

Kartawinata said that the current government's certain actions on the issue of fighting against colonialism and recovering West Irian are inconsistent with the spirit of Indonesian national independence.

D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, said in his speech that some people say that cooperation between religious parties, nationalists, and communists is just a myth, and the holding of this conference refutes the views of these people. He said that the holding of the conference struck a blow to those who split and obstruct national unity, especially a heavy blow to those colonialists who still do not want to leave Indonesian territory.

Aidit elaborated in detail in his speech on the colonialists' economic dominance in this country. He said that the current foreign capital in Indonesia is at least 63 billion rupiah, including 40 billion rupiah of Dutch capital. According to rough estimates, the annual interest on foreign capital in Indonesia is equal to a quarter of its total value, or 15 billion rupiah. The government's statement on foreign investment on December 8 last year shows that the current government's policy is to expand the influence of foreign monopoly capital in this country, which means facilitating foreign monopoly capital to interfere in our political and defense affairs.

Aidit said that the need for capital must first be resolved with Indonesia's own strength. Loans and aid should be drawn from all aspects, without any discrimination and without any conditions that are detrimental to the interests of the nation and the people.

Former Prime Minister and one of the leaders of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, Ali Sastroamidjojo, spoke last. He said that the current government has adopted policies that violate the people's wishes, so it should resign, or at least not take any actions with far-reaching consequences. He demanded that a new parliament be organized as soon as possible.

Sastroamidjojo said that the program of the future cabinet should include the following points: national peace at home, an economic plan to improve the people's living conditions, construction, public safety, and an active and independent foreign policy based on the interests of the people and the maintenance of world peace. The former prime minister advocated adhering to the ten principles adopted by the Bandung Conference.

The conference finally passed three resolutions. The first resolution demanded that the Harahap government stop negotiations with the Netherlands and immediately recall the Indonesian delegation; and demanded to recover West Irian by relying on the strength of people's unity and with the help of friendly Asian and African countries. The resolution also called for the implementation of the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference.

The second resolution demanded that the government change its economic and financial policies, lower the prices of daily necessities and improve people's lives, help national enterprises, and limit the influence of foreign capital.

The third resolution demanded the establishment of a new cabinet based on the election results. It demanded that the current cabinet declare itself dissolvable and establish a caretaker cabinet whose sole task is to convene a new parliament.

After the mass rally, a delegation composed of Sastroamidjojo, Kartawinata, and Aidit presented the resolutions of the mass rally to President Sukarno.

The President delivered a brief speech to the crowd in front of the Independence Palace. He said that he was very happy to receive the delegation, because the three political leaders symbolized the cooperation between the three major political groups, namely Marxists, nationalists, and Muslims, and symbolized the principles of anti-colonialism and safeguarding democracy. He said that the mass rally proved that cooperation between different political groups is possible.

The President once again emphasized that the 20% of the Indonesian people who support the Communist Party cannot be excluded from the big family of national unity.

He called for the realization of revolutionary national unity to recover West Irian. He called on the people to emulate the example of the people of the People's Republic of China, Vietnam, Algeria, and other parts of the world who have organized the power of the people to fight for their independence.

### 雅加达75万人举行  “反殖民主义和保卫人权群众大会”

    雅加达75万人举行
    “反殖民主义和保卫人权群众大会”
    据新华社雅加达16日电　1月15日上午，雅加达独立广场举行了有75万人参加的“反殖民主义和保卫人权群众大会”。
    从清晨起，人群就从这个城市的各个角落源源不断地进入广场。人们拿着无数的红白旗（印度尼西亚国旗）和写着口号的旗帜来参加大会。这些口号是：“立即停止同荷兰的谈判”，“按照全印度尼西亚人民代表大会的决议收复西伊里安”，“立即解散伯汉努丁·哈拉哈普内阁”，“成立进步的民族联合内阁”，“立即成立新国会”，“粉碎回教国运动和印度尼西亚回教军”。
    全印度尼西亚人民代表大会主席、印度尼西亚回教联盟党主席阿鲁齐·卡塔韦纳塔在会上首先发言说：印度尼西亚共和国属于印度尼西亚全体人民而不属于任何一个集团。凡是不希望团结的任何集团都是自私的。他又说：“只有各阶层的人民，包括马克思主义者、民族主义者和回教徒团结起来，我们才能消除荷兰的残余势力和粉碎殖民统治。”
    卡塔韦纳塔说，现政府在反对殖民主义的斗争和收回西伊里安的斗争的问题上的某些行动是和印度尼西亚民族独立的精神不相一致的。
    印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地在发言时说，有些人说宗教党派，民族主义者和共产主义者合作只是神话，这次大会的召开驳倒了这些人的看法。他说，大会的召开打击了分裂和阻挠全国团结的人们，特别是沉重地打击了那些仍然不想离开印度尼西亚国土的殖民主义者。
    艾地在他的讲话中详细论述了殖民主义者在这个国家经济方面的统治。他说，目前印度尼西亚的外国资本至少等于630亿盾，包括400亿盾荷兰资本。据粗略的估计，在印度尼西亚外国资本的每年利息等于它的总价值的四分之一，即150亿盾。去年12月8日政府关于外国投资的声明说明现政府的政策是扩大外国垄断资本在这个国家的影响，这就是说便利外国垄断资本干涉我们的政治和国防事务。
    艾地说，首先必须用印度尼西亚自己的力量来解决资本需要问题。应当从一切方面吸取借款和援助，不能有任何歧视，不能附带任何有损于民族和人民利益的条件。
    前总理和印度尼西亚国民党领袖之一阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约最后发言。他说，目前的政府采取了违反人民愿望的政策，所以它应当辞职，或者至少不应当采取任何发生深远后果的行动。他要求尽快组织新国会。
    沙斯特罗阿米佐约说，未来内阁的纲领应该包括下面几点：国内的全国和平，改善人民生活条件的经济计划，建设，公共安全，建立在人民的利益和维护世界和平的基础上的积极的、独立的外交政策。这位前任总理主张坚持奉行万隆会议所通过的十项原则。
    大会最后通过了3项决议。第一项决议要求哈拉哈普政府停止同荷兰谈判，立即召回印度尼西亚代表团；并且要求依靠人民团结的力量和在友好的亚非国家的帮助下收复西伊里安。决议还要求实行亚非会议的各项决议。
    第二项决议要求政府改变它的经济财政政策，降低日用必需品的价格和改善人民生活，帮助民族企业和限制外国资本的影响。
    第三项决议要求根据选举结果成立新的内阁。它要求目前的内阁宣布自己可以解散，并且成立仅以召集新国会为唯一任务的看守内阁。
    在群众大会结束以后，由沙斯特罗阿米佐约、卡塔韦纳塔和艾地组成的代表团把群众大会的决议交给苏加诺总统。
    总统在独立宫前面向群众发表简短的讲话。他说，他很高兴接见代表团，因为三位政治领袖象征着三个主要的政治集团、即马克思主义者、民族主义者和回教徒之间的合作，象征着反殖民主义和维护民主的原则。他说，群众大会证明，不同的政治集团之间的合作是可能的。
    总统再一次强调说，不能把支持共产党的20％的印度尼西亚人民排斥在民族团结的大家庭之外。
    他要求实现革命的民族团结以收复西伊里安。他号召人民效法把人民的力量组织起来为自己的独立而斗争的中华人民共和国、越南、阿尔及利亚和世界其他地方的人民的榜样。
