    Jiaotong University Professor Zhou Ming
    Successfully Develops a Most Accurate Horse Racing Timer
    Xinhua News Agency: Zhou Ming, a 68-year-old professor at Jiaotong University, has recently successfully developed an electric horse racing timer with an accuracy of 1/100th of a second. Ordinary horse racing timers have a maximum accuracy of only one-tenth of a second. The electric horse racing timer can not only measure very short periods of time, but also measure speed, acceleration, period, etc., which will be of great help to physics experiments and other teaching experiments.

    研究一种最准确的跑马表成功
    68岁的交通大学教授周铭，最近研究成功一种准确到1％秒的电动跑马表。普通用的跑马表，最高准确度只有十分之一秒。电动跑马表不但可以测量很短的时间，还可以测量速度、加速度、周期等，对物理实验和其他教学实验将有较大的帮助。
