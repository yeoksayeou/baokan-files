    Adapt to the New Situation and Improve Leadership Work
    Chen Jun Gao Changren
    In the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the CPC Xiangtan Prefectural Committee of Hunan Province improved its leadership methods, strengthened the inspection and research of work, and specifically helped various counties implement the party's policies and the instructions of the higher party committees.
    After the provincial district committee secretary meeting in November 1955, the prefectural committee specifically guided the counties to hold good three-level cadre meetings, combined with party rectification, to conduct overall planning and strengthen party leadership. At the beginning of the three-level cadre meetings in various counties, many district and township cadres believed that the slow development of the cooperativization movement in the past was the responsibility of the provincial and county committees, and they had nothing to examine. After discovering this situation, the prefectural committee promptly requested the county and district committees to take the lead in conducting self-criticism, deeply study Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" and the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, combined with the analysis of the class dynamics and class differentiation in various townships, criticize capitalist ideas and behaviors within the party, examine the implementation of class policies and the attitude of county and district committee comrades in the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. After in-depth self-criticism, summing up experiences and lessons, the party's ideology was unified, and the party's leadership over the cooperativization movement was greatly strengthened.
    The first and deputy secretaries of the prefectural committee and most of the members of the prefectural committee directly participated in the leadership of the agricultural cooperativization movement, and determined that Yintian District of Xiangtan County and Qingquan and Qimei Townships should be the key points for the prefectural committee to grasp. In addition to grasping overall leadership, the secretary of the prefectural committee and the secretary-general of the prefectural committee also focused on inspecting work in the townships. Other members of the prefectural committee were each responsible for leading the work of two key counties. While fully leading the cooperativization movement, the prefectural committee also took into account the leadership of other work. One method was to designate a few members of the prefectural committee to lead financial and economic work, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, etc.; another method was to establish special groups, such as the work of trial-running advanced cooperatives and the research and collection of the 1955 production increase experience, which were all the responsibility of groups of three to five people. This is how the Party Committee's comprehensive and specific leadership is realized.
    In order to ensure the smooth development of the cooperativization movement, the prefectural committee also drew 3,000 cadres from the prefectural and county-level organs to form a cooperativization work team, plus the cadres from the county districts participating in cooperativization work, a total of more than 8,600 people. According to the average calculation of 3,000 townships in the entire region, each township can have two cadres sent by the higher authorities to guide and assist the township branches in their work. The prefectural committee also transferred 51 leading cadres at the prefectural level from various organs, such as the director of the Grain Bureau, the manager of the Food Company, and the president of the Bank, to participate in the cooperativization movement in the countryside. On the one hand, send truly capable cadres down to effectively strengthen the leadership of the cooperativization movement; on the other hand, allow the responsible comrades of various organs to personally participate in the movement, understand the new changes after rural cooperativization, and facilitate the improvement of work.
    In order to grasp the situation in a timely manner, the prefectural committee also established a telephone conference and telephone reporting system, and organized three inspection groups that were dispatched to various counties for inspection work as needed.
    The prefectural committee used such multifaceted organizational work to understand the situation and grasp the movement. After the cooperativization movement unfolded in the countryside, the responsible comrades of the prefectural committee constantly discovered new problems from the key districts and key townships. For example, after the movement fully unfolded, in the upsurge of the masses actively signing up to join the cooperatives, cadres were easily hot-headed, thinking that the poor peasants had already become active and there was no need to do any more in-depth ideological work, and there was a phenomenon of rushing into action and crude and simple work. In handling specific issues related to policies, many cadres believed that with the demonstration regulations and the appearance of old cooperatives, "if the aunt doesn't know how to make shoes, the sister-in-law has a model," they regarded the handling of specific issues as simple; but problems arose as soon as they went into actual work. In land appraisal, poor peasants advocated using the output determined by field investigation as the basis, while middle peasants mostly advocated using the actual output of the three fixed households as the basis; on the issue of land and labor remuneration, poor peasants supported fixed remuneration, while middle peasants advocated rising tides and rising boats, and the method of remuneration by share. As for the township cadres? Many people, when considering that they often lost working time, also tended to adopt the method of remuneration by share.
    The timely understanding and grasping of these situations guaranteed the timely and correct guidance of the prefectural committee to the cooperativization movement in the entire region.
    The Xiangtan Prefectural Committee emphasized the combination of production in the work of building cooperatives. As soon as a cooperative is established, it is necessary to arrange production and formulate a production plan for 1956. By around December 20, 1955, more than 10,000 new and old agricultural production cooperatives in the region had generally formulated plans to expand production in 1956. According to the statistics of 2,110 cooperatives in 7 counties including Pingjiang, Chaling, and Xiangtan, it is planned to expand the area of double-cropping rice to 220,000 mu in 1956. And actively carry out winter farmland water conservancy construction, do a good job in winter ploughing, pest control, and manure accumulation. More than 1,600 townships sent out 328,000 workers every day to rush to repair ponds and dams. 1,295 cooperatives have accumulated 2.72 million dan of various fertilizers and ploughed more than 20,000 mu of fields. After the prefectural committee organized special personnel to study the experience of agricultural cooperatives in increasing production, diversified management, and business management in the past year of 1955, it held a meeting of model cooperative directors to exchange experience in increasing production and promote it. At the end of December 1955, the prefectural committee also held a meeting of county party committee secretaries to examine and study the work of carrying out the large-scale production movement. The meeting criticized the backward ideas of many comrades who used the viewpoint of treating the small peasant economy to lead the production movement after the cooperativization upsurge. In order to reverse the situation that ideological progress lags behind the development of the situation, after research, the meeting proposed that the prefectural and county committees should establish special committees or special groups, divide the work for research, conduct overall planning, formulate more detailed production increase plans for 1956 and 1957, and formulate a long-term plan for 7 to 12 years; it is necessary to quickly mobilize the masses to make overall production plans for each township; all new and old cooperatives must fully turn to production, repair water conservancy, accumulate fertilizer, and prepare for spring ploughing and expansion of double-cropping rice planting.
    In order to welcome the production upsurge in 1956, the prefectural committee also inspected the work in various aspects. Taking water conservancy work as an example, the water conservancy bureau of the prefecture ordered a plan to increase water conservancy construction, which was to increase by 10% to 20% according to the average workload from 1951 to 1955. Obviously, this plan is a conservative plan; according to this plan, it will be far from meeting the requirements of farmers to expand the area of double-cropping rice after cooperativization. Xiangtan Prefecture originally planned to expand double-cropping rice by 1 million mu in 1956. Now, according to the development of cooperativization, it has been increased to 1.9 million mu. This requires solving the problem of water conservancy. If the water conservancy bureau increases the workload by 10% to 20%, if the dozens of days before spring ploughing when water conservancy can still be built are missed, it will be difficult to expand the area of double-cropping rice. The secretary of the prefectural committee participated in the prefectural water conservancy work conference, pointed out the new situation at the meeting, criticized conservative ideas, and guided the planning of water conservancy. In order to solve the new problems that have emerged in various aspects of work after cooperativization, the prefectural committee is preparing to convene various meetings to discuss specialized issues.
    In the cooperativization movement, the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee is adapting to the development of the situation and is working hard to improve leadership work.

    适应新形势，改进领导工作
    陈浚　高长任
    中共湖南省湘潭地委，在农业合作化运动的高潮中改进了领导方法，加强了对工作的检查和研究，具体帮助各县贯彻执行党的政策和上级党委的指示。
    在1955年11月全省区委书记会议之后，地委具体指导了各县开好三级干部会议，结合整党，进行全面规划，加强党的领导。各县的三级干部会议刚开始的时候，许多区乡干部认为过去合作化运动发展慢了，都是省委县委的责任，自己没有什么可以检查的。地委发现了这个情况，就及时要求县委区委带头检查，深入学习毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会（扩大）“关于农业合作化问题”的决议，结合分析各乡的阶级动态、阶级分化的情况，批判党内的资本主义思想和行为，检查了执行阶级政策的情况以及在社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争中县委和区委同志们的态度。经过深入检查，总结经验教训，统一了党内思想，大大加强了党对合作化运动的领导。
    地委正副书记以及大部分地委委员都直接参加了农业合作化运动的领导工作，并确定把湘潭县银田区和清泉、棋梅两个乡作为地委掌握的重点。地委书记和地委秘书长除掌握全面领导外，并有重点地到乡检查工作。其他地委委员每人负责重点领导两个县的工作。在全力领导合作化运动的同时，地委还照顾到对其他工作的领导。一种办法是指定少数几个地委委员，分别领导财经工作、肃反运动等；另一种办法是成立专门小组，比如关于试办高级社的工作，关于研究和搜集1955年的增产经验，都由三人到五人的小组负责。这样来实现党委全面而又具体的领导。
    为了保证合作化运动的顺利展开，地委还从专区和县两级机关中抽出3，000名干部，组成合作化工作队，加上县区参加合作化工作的干部，一共有8，600多人。按照全区3，000个乡平均计算的话，每个乡可以有两个上级派去的干部指导和帮助乡支部进行工作。地委还抽调了专区一级各机关的负责人，粮食局长、食品公司经理、银行行长等一级干部51人，到农村参加合作化运动。一方面把真正有能力的干部派下去，切实加强对合作化运动的领导；另一方面可以让各机关负责同志亲自参加运动，了解农村合作化以后的新变化，便于改进工作。
    为了及时掌握情况，地委还建立了电话会议、电话汇报的制度，组织了根据需要派到各县检查工作的3个检查组。
    地委通过这样多方面的组织工作，来了解情况，掌握运动。合作化运动在农村中展开以后，地委负责同志从重点区和重点乡中，不断地发现新的问题。比如运动全面展开起来，在群众积极报名入社的热潮里，干部很容易头脑发热，认为贫农已经积极起来，不需要再做什么深入的思想工作了，就出现了一轰而起、工作简单粗糙的现象。在处理有关政策的具体问题上，不少干部认为有了示范章程，又有了老社的样子，“姑姑不会做鞋，嫂嫂有样子”，就把处理具体问题看得简单了；可是一到实际工作中，就发生了问题。土地评产，贫农主张按照以查田定产的产量为基础，中农多主张以三定到户的实产量为基础；在土地和劳动报酬问题上，贫农拥护固定报酬，中农却主张水涨船高，按分成报酬的方法。至于乡干部呢？有不少的人，当考虑到自己经常误工的时候，也就偏向于采取分成报酬的办法。
    对这些情况的及时了解和掌握，就保证了地委对全专区合作化运动的及时而正确的指导。
    湘潭地委在建社工作中强调了结合生产，一建成社，就要安排好生产，制定1956年的生产计划。到1955年12月20日前后，全区已有1万多个新的和老的农业生产合作社，普遍制定了1956年扩大生产的计划。据平江、茶陵、湘潭7个县2，110个社的统计，1956年计划扩大双季稻的面积到22万亩。并且积极进行冬季兴修农田水利、搞好冬耕、治虫、积肥等工作。有1，600多个乡，每日出工328，000多人，赶修塘坝。1，295个社，已积各种肥料272万担，翻田2万多亩。地委在组织专人研究了1955年一年来农业社增产、多种经营和经营管理的经验以后，召开了一次模范社长会议，交流增产的经验，加以推广。在1955年12月底，地委又召开了县委书记会议，检查和研究了开展大生产运动的工作。会上批判了许多同志用对待小农经济的观点，领导合作化高潮以后的生产运动的落后思想。为了扭转思想落后于形势发展的情况，经过研究，会议提出地委和县委都要成立专门委员会或者专门小组，分工研究，进行全面规划，制定比较详细的1956年和1957年的增产计划，制定7年到12年的远景规划；要迅速发动群众，作出各乡的全面的生产规划；所有的新社和老社，都要全力转入生产，修水利，积肥料，作好春耕和扩大种植双季稻的准备工作。
    地委为了迎接1956年的生产高潮，又检查了各方面的工作。就举水利工作来说，专区水利局订的增修水利的计划，是照1951年到1955年的平均工作量，增加10％到20％。 显然，这个计划是个保守的计划；按照这个计划，就远远不能满足合作化以后农民扩大双季稻面积的要求。湘潭专区原来计划在1956年扩大双季稻100万亩。现在，根据合作化的发展已经提高到190万亩。这就需要解决水利问题。如果按照水利局增加10％到20％的工作量，如果错过了春耕前还可以兴修水利的几十天时间，就很难扩大双季稻的面积。地委书记参加了专区的水利工作会议，在会上指出了新的形势，批判了保守思想，指导了水利的规划工作。为了解决合作化以后在各方面工作中出现的新问题，地委正在筹备召开各种讨论专门问题的会议。
    湘潭地委在合作化运动中，适应着形势的发展，正在努力改进领导工作。
