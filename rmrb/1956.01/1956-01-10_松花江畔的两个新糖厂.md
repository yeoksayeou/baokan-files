Two New Sugar Refineries on the Banks of the Songhua River
Xi Cheng

On the banks of the beautiful Songhua River, two modern, locally state-owned sugar refineries have recently been built. One is the Jiamusi Friendship Sugar Refinery, located in the western suburbs of Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province, and the other is the New China Sugar Refinery, located in the suburbs of Jilin City, Jilin Province. Both factories were built with the help of the People's Republic of Poland, and each has an annual output of 24,000 tons.

Both factories are highly mechanized and automated. After the sugar beets are unloaded from the train to the flume yard, water carries them from the flume ditches into the factory building. Here, machines automatically remove the grass, sand, and stones from the sugar beets, washing them until they are white and clean. Then, machines cut them into shreds and send them to diffusion tanks to extract the sugar juice. The sugar juice is sent to evaporation tanks after being cleaned. In the evaporation tanks, the water is evaporated; the syrup is then sent to crystallization tanks to form small sugar crystals. After the centrifugal separator separates the sugar crystals from the molasses, pure white sugar is obtained. The sugar flows from the dryer onto a long belt, which continuously transports it to the packaging room.

All the machinery and equipment in these two factories are state-of-the-art. Take the beet slicer as an example. In the old slicers, when changing the blades, the belt had to be moved to another electric roller, requiring several people to push the machine to remove the blades. In these two factories, when changing the blades, the workers only need to press a button, and the machine stops automatically. Pressing another button slowly rotates the machine. Another example is the crystallizer, one of the main pieces of equipment for sugar production. It contains a spiral steel plate heater, which has a large heating area and high efficiency, shortening the sugar boiling time. It takes only four to six hours to boil first-grade sugar, and one tank can boil 40 tons of sugar paste, producing 35 tons of sugar. Because the production equipment is advanced, the workers also save a lot of effort in operation. For example, in the sugar juice filtration process, the old machinery and equipment required manual labor to tighten the filter plates and frames before filtration. This was the most tiring work in the sugar refinery. With the adoption of plate and frame filter presses, manual operation is no longer required here. Workers only need to control the machine to work.

The entire production process in these two factories is automated. The central instrument control panel controls every production link in the factory—processing volume, temperature, flow rate, steam, water temperature, sugar content, and losses in each part. The central instrument control panel uses different signal lights, such as white, red, and green, to indicate the production status of each production link. A white signal on the instrument control panel indicates normal production; a red signal indicates that the temperature has exceeded the standard; a green signal indicates that the temperature is not high enough, and workers can start heating. Slicing workers can know the slicing quantity at a glance by looking at the instrument. If workers in the cleaning group want to know if the sugar juice is clean, the instrument can also tell them in time. Even the content of carbon dioxide in the lime kiln, which produces lime raw materials for sugar production, can be displayed by the instrument. This is more convenient, timely, and accurate than using laboratory tests to control production in old-style sugar refineries.

The power system equipment of the entire factory is even better, which can save a lot of fuel. The high-pressure boiler is equipped with advanced equipment such as water-cooled walls, water softening, deoxygenation, soot blowing economizers, which greatly improves the heat utilization rate. It only takes ten tons of coal steam to process one hundred tons of sugar beets, which is 5% to 10% less coal than the average sugar refinery, saving more than 1,500 tons of coal per month. Steam is also used very rationally. The steam generated by the boiler is first used to generate electricity, and then the waste steam from the turbine generator is supplied to the sugar production workshop.

The design and machinery of these two sugar refineries were supplied by Poland; they also received assistance from Polish experts during the construction process. Whether in the harsh winter with snow and ice or in the continuous rainy summer; whether on scaffolding dozens of meters high or in underground pipelines several meters deep, Polish experts worked hard with Chinese workers and engineering technicians. In the Jiamusi Friendship Sugar Refinery, when the construction of the factory's pipeline engineering was at its most intense, Polish mechanical expert Grawaski, who was over 60 years old, fell ill due to overwork. The doctor told him to rest for a few days, but he only rested for one day. To help us reinforce the foundation, the famous Polish professor Dr. Czeboterowicz carried out soil inspections and drew drawings while ill, and personally guided the workers in using his created advanced soil reinforcement method—soil electro-siliconization method, which made the loose soil under the factory foundation hard and ensured the quality of the project. To solve the "short circuit" accident of the coiling machine current in the lime kiln, electrical expert Wilner spent more than ten consecutive days inspecting every cable head in the pipeline. In the New China Sugar Refinery, Horoginski guided the workers in digging wells in the pouring rain. On the day of the turbine generator test run, Tomczynski did not leave the workshop for a day and a night.

The workers and engineering technicians who built the factories overcame various difficulties in order to produce sugar as soon as possible. In March 1955, the Jiamusi Friendship Sugar Refinery began installing high-pressure boilers. The expansion and contraction of this high-pressure boiler are very large, and welding it too thick or too thin can cause an explosion. The installation time was also very tight, and the three boilers had to be welded within three months, otherwise the entire project would be delayed. Electric welder Qu Changfa bravely accepted this task. In the summer, it was very hot inside the boiler, and it was also high-altitude work. Welding a joint required lying down and getting up several times, and the face was very close to the weldment. If you were not careful, the sparks would burn your skin. Once, Qu Changfa fainted because he insisted on working for too long. After the apprentice woke him up, he insisted on continuing to work. Under his selfless labor, the first boiler was welded in only 15 days. Then, the second and third units were quickly welded. The workers who built the New China Sugar Refinery carefully implemented the suggestions of the Polish experts, allowing the factory to be completed more than a month ahead of schedule.

In addition to producing large quantities of sugar to meet the needs of the people's lives, these two modern sugar refineries also use waste molasses to produce 96-degree alcohol every day. To support agricultural production, the New China Sugar Refinery also plans to build a waste pulp drying workshop next year to turn the waste pulp into feed. It is expected to produce 11,700 tons per year at a particularly low price, and nearby farmers can buy it at any time.

　　松花江畔的两个新糖厂
    习成
    在美丽的松花江畔，最近新建成了两个现代化的地方国营制糖厂。一座是位于黑龙江省佳木斯市西郊的佳木斯友谊糖厂，另一座是位于吉林省吉林市郊的新中国制糖厂。这两座工厂都是在波兰人民共和国的帮助下建设起来的，年产量都是两万四千吨。
    这两个工厂都是高度机械化和自动化的。甜菜由火车上卸到流送场后，水就把它们从流送沟里流送进厂房。在这里，机器自动地把甜菜里的草和沙石清除出来，把它们洗的又白又干净。然后，机器又把它们切成丝，送到渗出罐渗出糖水来。糖水经过清净设备再送到蒸发罐里去。在蒸发罐里，水份被蒸发了；糖浆又被送到结晶罐结成小小的砂糖粒。分蜜机把砂糖粒和糖蜜分开后，就得到洁白的砂糖。砂糖从干燥机里流到一条长长的皮带上，不断地被运送到包装室里去。
    这两个厂的全部机器设备都是最先进的。就拿切甜菜丝的切丝机来说吧，旧的切丝机在换刀的时候，先得把轮带搬到另一个电滚上去，要用好几个人推动机器，才能把刀换下来。这两座工厂的切丝机在换刀的时候，只要工人一按电钮，机器就自动停下来，再按另一个电钮，机器就慢慢地转动起来。又以制糖的主要机器设备之一——结晶罐为例，它里边有涡旋钢板加热器，加热面积大、效率高，煮糖的时间很短。煮一号砂糖的时间只需要四小时到六小时，而且一罐能煮40吨糖膏，出35吨糖。由于生产设备先进，工人操作时也非常省力。如糖水过滤的这个工艺过程，过去旧的机器设备安装上滤板、滤框，要用人力把机器挤紧后才能过滤。它是糖厂最累的工作。由于采用了板框式压滤机，在这里已经不再用人力操作了，工人们只要指挥着机器工作就行了。
    这两座工厂的全部生产程序是自动化的。全厂每个生产环节——加工量，各部分的温度、流量、蒸汽、水温、含糖量和各部分损失量，都由中央仪表控制台来控制。中央仪表控制台用白、红、绿等不同的信号灯来表示每一个生产环节的生产情况。仪表控制台闪着白色信号，就表示生产正常；仪表控制台闪出红色信号，就表示温度已经超过了标准；仪表控制台闪出绿色信号，就表示温度不够，工人可以开始加温。切丝工人想知道切丝数量，一看仪表就知道。清净组的工人如果要知道糖水是否干净，仪表也能及时地告诉他。就连为制糖而生产石灰原料的石灰窑内二氧化炭的含量，仪表都能表示出来。这比旧式糖厂利用化验来控制生产要方便、及时、准确得多。
    全厂动力系统的设备更好，能节省很多燃料。高压锅炉附有水冷壁和软化水、除氧、吹灰省煤器等先进设备，使热量利用率大为提高。处理一百吨甜菜只用十吨煤的蒸汽，比一般制糖厂用煤量少5％到10％，一个月就能节省1，500多吨煤。蒸汽利用得也非常合理，锅炉蒸出来的汽，最先利用来发电，然后再用从透平发电机出来的废蒸汽供给制糖车间使用。
    这两个糖厂的设计和机器都是由波兰供给的；在建厂过程中也得到了波兰专家的帮助。无论是风雪交加的严冬，还是阴雨连绵的夏天；无论在几十公尺高的脚手架上，还是在几公尺深的地下管道里，波兰专家都同中国工人和工程技术人员在一起紧张地工作着。在佳木斯友谊糖厂，当工厂管路工程建设最紧张的时候，60多岁的波兰机械专家格拉瓦斯基曾因过度疲劳而病倒了，医生让他休息几天，但是他只休息一天。波兰著名老教授柴别尔多维迟博士为了帮助我们加固地基，曾带病进行土壤检查和绘制图纸，并亲自指导工人们运用他所创造的先进土壤加固方法——土壤电动矽化法，使原来在厂房基础下松软的土壤变得坚硬，保证了工程质量。电气专家维尔尼尔为了解决石灰窑卷线机电流“短路”事故，曾一连十多天在管道里检查每一个电缆头。在新中国制糖厂，贺洛金斯基冒着倾盆大雨指导工人们打井。在透平发电机试车的那一天，托木琴斯基一天一夜没离开过车间。
    建厂的工人和工程技术人员们，为了早一天出糖，曾战胜了各种困难。1955年3月佳木斯友谊糖厂开始安装高压锅炉。这座高压锅炉的伸缩性很大，焊接过厚或过薄都会引起爆炸。安装的时间也特别紧迫，三个月必须把三台锅炉焊成，否则整个工程都得拖期。电焊工曲长发勇敢地接受了这项任务。夏天，锅炉里热得很，又是高空作业，焊一个口需要躺下、起来好几次，脸离焊件很近，一不小心，火花就烧破脸皮。有一次，曲长发因为坚持焊的时间过长，昏过去了，徒工把他唤醒过来以后，他仍坚持继续工作。在他忘我的劳动下，第一台锅炉仅仅用了15天就焊接完了。接着，第二台第三台也很快焊接完了。建设新中国制糖厂的工人们，认真地执行波兰专家的建议，使工厂得以提前一个多月建成。
    这两座近代化的糖厂，每天除了生产大量的砂糖来满足人民生活需要以外，还利用废蜜制成96度的酒精。为了支援农业生产，新中国制糖厂还计划在明年修建一个废粕干燥车间，把废粕制成饲料。预计每年可以生产11，700吨，价格特别便宜，附近的农民随时可以买到。
