　　Japanese Hosei University President Expresses Hope for Peaceful Coexistence Between China and Japan
    Kyodo News Comments on Recent International Situation and Japan-U.S. Relations

    (Reported by this newspaper) According to a Japanese radio broadcast on the 3rd, the president of Hosei University in Japan, Hyoe Ouchi, delivered a radio speech on the peaceful coexistence of China and Japan.

    Ouchi said, "In the past, Japan launched a reckless war and invaded China for nearly 20 years. The result was a complete defeat and unconditional surrender. Ten years have passed since then. However, normal diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not yet been restored, and economic exchanges and cultural communication cannot develop freely. Scholars from both countries cannot freely travel for investigation. It is also hindered if Chinese people want to smoke a pack of Japanese cigarettes or Japanese people want to drink a glass of Chinese rice wine. It is really unreasonable and cannot help but make us feel regretful."

    Ouchi said, "In the last Sino-Japanese War, Japan was the provocateur, Japan invaded China, and Japan was the one who was defeated in the end. Therefore, Japan should bear the responsibility, humbly ask for forgiveness, and restore the old friendship. Of course, it is Japan, not China, who should do this. I believe this is a common principle throughout ancient and modern times, both East and West. However, Japan has not yet paid these respects to China. For example, Japan has expressed its apologies in various ways to the Philippines and Burma for the damage they suffered during the war, but it has not said a single word of apology to China. As Japanese citizens, we feel this is very wrong. On the contrary, the Chinese side has made great efforts to show that it has completely forgotten the previous grievances and will cooperate with each other again and renew friendship, and has demonstrated these good intentions with actions."

    Then, Ouchi pointed out that the Asian-African Conference established the principle of peaceful coexistence and established "a great and sacred achievement" for world peace. He said: "Japan absolutely agrees with and supports this great mission. Also, at the end of last year, Soviet Premier Bulganin and others visited India and other Southeast Asian leaders and agreed to respect the peace principles set forth by the Asian-African Conference. I believe that if all countries can truly abide by these principles, then the new era of world history will be able to move forward one step further."

    Ouchi finally said that what hinders the implementation of this principle between China and Japan is that Japan's hands cannot move freely as if they were sick. We must find a way to cure this disease, restore our freedom of action, and then use our free hands to cooperate with China. We respect each other, exchange with each other, so that these two major countries in Asia can jointly shoulder the task of the pillar of peace in the world as soon as possible."

    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 5th: The Japanese "Kyodo News" published a commentary on January 5th entitled "Japan-U.S. Relations" on the recent international situation and the relationship between Japan and the United States.

    The commentary said, "Due to the major changes in the recent international situation, Japan will face a turning point in its relations with the United States in 1956." The commentary pointed out: "Japan has actually been a 'dependent state' of the United States," and "the policy of 'completely relying on the United States' adopted in the past will no longer guarantee Japan's stability and prosperity in the future."

    The commentary went on to say that Japan will take all possible measures to improve its international status, and "the successful conclusion of the Japan-Soviet peace negotiations will be one of these methods, and another method is to clearly indicate that Japan is going to take the road of independent diplomacy."

    The commentary said, "Until now, Japan has had no fixed policy towards Asia," but the Asian situation has undergone drastic changes, "Communist China has made great progress, and the influence of the so-called Bandung Group - including India, Burma, Indonesia and Egypt - is increasing. On the contrary, the influence of Southeast Asian Treaty Organization countries, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan, which clearly belong to the West, has been declining."

    The commentary said that if Japan does not get the support of the Asian and African countries participating in the Bandung Conference, "Japan's economic ties with Southeast Asia will not be successful, and Japan's economic ties with Southeast Asia are considered essential for Japan to achieve economic independence."

    The commentary concluded that this year, Japan will have to seriously consider the issue of its relationship with Beijing.

### 日本法政大学校长表示希望中日两国和平共处  共同社评论最近的国际形势和日美关系

　　日本法政大学校长表示希望中日两国和平共处
    共同社评论最近的国际形势和日美关系
    本报讯　据日本电台三日广播，日本法政大学校长大内兵卫发表了关于中日两国和平共处的广播演说。
    大内兵卫说：“在以前日本曾经发动了一次鲁莽的战争，向中国侵略，一共闹了差不多20年，但结果却一败涂地，宣告无条件降服，到现在已经又过了十年了。可是中日两国的正常国交还没有恢复，经济的交流、文化的沟通也不能自由发展，两国的学者也不能任意来往考察，或者中国人想吸一包日本的香烟或者日本人想喝一杯中国的老酒，这也有种种的阻碍，讲起来真是一件很不合理的事，不能不使我们觉得遗憾。”
    大内兵卫说，“上一次的中日之战，挑衅的是日本，打进中国的是日本，而最后吃了败仗的也是日本，所以应该负荆请罪，低首下心请求对方原谅，重修旧好的当然是日本而不是中国。我相信这是一项古今中西的共同道理，但是日本到了今天还没有对于中国稍尽这些礼仪。例如日本对于菲律宾、缅甸两国在战时所遭受的损害曾经以各种方式表示歉意，而对于中国却没有同样的一言半语来表示一下，以我们日本国民来讲，觉得这太不应该了。相反的，中国方面却极力表明把以前的怨恨都完全忘掉，再行互相合作，重新亲善友好，而且用行动表现了这些好意。”
    接着，大内兵卫指出，亚非会议确立了和平共处原则，为世界和平树立了“一项伟大而神圣的功业”。他说：“日本对于这项伟大的使命是绝对赞成拥护的。还有去年年底苏联的布尔加宁总理等人往访印度各地和东南亚各国的首脑相约尊重亚非会议所订的和平原则。我相信，如果各国都能真正地遵守这些原则，那么世界历史的新时代将能更加向前接近一步。”
    大内兵卫最后说，妨碍中日之间实行这种原则的是，日本的手像患着疾病一样地不能自由活动。我们对于这种疾病一定要设法治好，恢复我们的行动自由，然后用我们的自由双手和中国合作。我们互相尊重、互相交流，使亚洲的这两大国家早日能够共同在世界上担负起和平支柱的任务”。
    新华社5日讯　东京消息：日本“共同通讯社”在5日以“日美关系”为题，就最近的国际形势和日本和美国的关系发表了评论。
    评论说，“由于国际形势最近有了重大的改变，日本在其同美国的关系上将在1956年面临一个转折点”。评论指出：“日本实际上一直是美国的‘附属国’”，“以前所采取的‘完全依靠美国’的政策，以后再不会保证日本的稳定和繁荣了。”
    评论接着说，日本将采取一切可能的办法来提高它的国际地位，而“日（本）苏（联）和平谈判的顺利结束将是这种办法之一，另一种办法就是明显地表示日本要走上独立外交的道路。”
    评论说，“到现在为止，日本对亚洲没有固定的政策”，但是，亚洲形势已发生了剧烈的改变，“共产党中国有了巨大进步，所谓万隆集团—包括印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚和埃及一的影响正在增加。相反，显然属于西方的东南亚条约组织国家及韩国、台湾和日本的影响一直在减退。”
    评论说，日本如果得不到参加万隆会议的亚非国家的支持，“日本要同东南亚发生经济联系是不会成功的，而日本同东南亚的经济联系被认为是日本获得经济独立所必不可少的。”
    评论最后说，今年，日本将不得不认真考虑同北京的关系问题。
