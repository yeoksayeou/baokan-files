Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, January 4th: News from Laos: The Lao Fighting Forces General Headquarters recently responded to the International Commission for Laos, expressing its welcome to the resolution proposed by the International Commission for Laos to the General Headquarters of the Royal Lao Army and the General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces regarding the cessation of hostilities between the two sides in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly. This resolution was made at the meeting of the International Commission for Laos on December 9, 1955.

In this resolution, the International Commission suggested to both sides that, except for clear reasons of self-defense, firstly, all hostile actions against each other must cease; secondly, there must be no actions that would undermine the ceasefire in the two provinces, and any violation of this point must be regarded as a serious violation of the Geneva Accords.

In its reply, the General Headquarters of the Lao Fighting Forces also emphasized that the Lao side will cooperate closely with the International Commission for Laos and hopes that the International Commission will resolutely use all its authority in implementing this resolution to stop the hostilities in the two provinces.

    寮方欢迎老挝国际委员会关于停火的决议
    新华社河内4日电　老挝消息：寮国战斗部队总司令部最近答复老挝国际委员会，表示欢迎老挝国际委员会向老挝王国军队总司令部和寮国战斗部队总司令部提出的关于双方在桑怒、丰沙里两省停止敌对行动的决议。这一决议是老挝国际委员会在1955年12月9日的会议上作出的。
    老挝国际委员会在这一决议中向双方建议，除了有自卫的明确理由外，第一，必须停止相互之间的一切敌对行动；第二，不能有破坏两省停火的行动，违犯这一点就必须被视为严重违反日内瓦协定。
    寮国战斗部队总司令部在答复中还强调说，寮国方面将同老挝国际委员会密切合作，并且希望国际委员会在执行这个决议时，坚决使用自己的一切权限，以停止在两省的敌对行动。
