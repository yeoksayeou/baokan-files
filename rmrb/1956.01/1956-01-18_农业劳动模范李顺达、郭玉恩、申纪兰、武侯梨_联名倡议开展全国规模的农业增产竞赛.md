Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, January 17th: National renowned agricultural labor models Li Shunda, Guo Yu'en, Shen Jilan, and Wu Houli from Shanxi Province, jointly proposed to agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers nationwide, to launch an agricultural production increase competition to complete and exceed the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. The proposal they issued is as follows:

    We have studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the People's Daily New Year's Day editorial, which greatly encouraged us. Our "Golden Star," "May First," and "Red Star" three advanced agricultural production cooperatives, recently formulated targets for continued over-production in 1956 after achieving the first Five-Year Plan targets ahead of schedule. We also jointly propose to launch a national-scale production increase competition.

    Our conditions are:

    1.  Total output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations: the "Golden Star" Cooperative will increase by 70% compared to last year, completing 156.9% of the first Five-Year Plan target; the "May First" Cooperative will increase by 80% compared to last year, completing 162% of the first Five-Year Plan target; the "Red Star" Cooperative will increase by 59% compared to last year, completing 154% of the first Five-Year Plan target.

    2.  Grain yield per mu of cultivated land should increase by 100 to 126 jin compared to last year, exceeding the Five-Year Plan target by 11% to 23%. Among them, the "Golden Star" Cooperative will achieve an average of 480 jin per mu, the "May First" Cooperative will reach 480 jin, and the "Red Star" Cooperative will reach 490 jin.

    3.  Each cooperative should have more than 100 mu of high-yield demonstration fields with a yield of 1,000 jin of corn per mu.

    4.  Ensure the completion of the state's procurement plan for agricultural products.

    Our three cooperatives are located in areas with more mountains and less land, and the soil quality is very poor; there is a lack of water sources, and there are frequent threats of drought, wind, and insect disasters. However, after we switched to advanced cooperatives, we also had many favorable conditions. We plan to fully exploit the superior conditions of the advanced cooperatives and take the following basic measures:

    1.  The labor utilization rate of the members of the three cooperatives will increase by 40% to 50% compared to last year. Use these labor potential to carry out large-scale farmland capital construction, repair river beaches, terrace the fields by adding embankments, lining and backfilling to increase the cultivated area by 400 mu.

    2.  Apply 100 to 115 dan of fertilizer per mu of all grain crops, an increase of 30% to 50% compared to last year.

    3.  Break with convention, implement low-yield transformation to high-yield, single-cropping to intercropping, and expand multiple cropping. The planting area of high-yield crops such as corn and potatoes in the three cooperatives accounts for 56% of the total autumn field planting area, an increase of 1,295 mu compared to last year; all 3,770 mu of cultivated land that can be intercropped will be intercropped; and multiple cropping will be expanded by 255 mu.

    4.  According to the lack of water sources in mountainous areas, the three cooperatives will build 495 dry canals, dig 130 dry wells, and build 25 reservoirs this year, so that the area irrigated by mountain floods reaches 55% of the autumn fields.

    5.  Popularize improved varieties. This year, the three cooperatives will sow "Golden Queen" corn and "Hen's Beak" millet to reach 90% of the grain crops; and continue to promote effective measures such as rational close planting, artificial pollination of corn, chemical irrigation of corn hearts, and poison bait to kill insects. Eliminate crop pests and rodents.

    6.  All cultivated land that can be deep ploughed with double-furrow plows and mountain plows will be deep ploughed.

    Finally, we are willing to work with farmers across the country, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the higher-level Party committees, to continue to run the cooperatives diligently and thriftily, in accordance with the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical, work hard, and continue to strive for greater over-production achievements.

    农业劳动模范李顺达、郭玉恩、申纪兰、武侯梨
    联名倡议开展全国规模的农业增产竞赛
    新华社太原17日电　全国著名的农业劳动模范山西省李顺达、郭玉恩、申纪兰和武侯梨，联名向全国的农业生产合作社、互助组和农民，提出了为提早和超额完成五年计划开展农业增产竞赛的倡议。他们发出的倡议书如下：
    我们学习了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和人民日报元旦社论，这对我们鼓舞很大。我们“金星”、“五一”、“红星”3个高级农业生产合作社，最近在提前达到第一个五年计划指标后制定了1956年继续超额增产的指标。我们并联名倡议，开展一个全国规模的增产竞赛。
    我们的条件是：
    一、农业、林业、畜牧业和副业的生产总值：“金星”社比去年增加70％，完成第一个五年计划指标的156.9％；“五一”社比去年增加80％，完成第一个五年计划指标的162％；“红星”社比去年增加59％，完成第一个五年计划指标的154％。
    二、每亩耕地的粮食产量要比去年增加100到126斤，超过五年计划指标的11％到23％。其中“金星”社每亩平均达到480斤，“五一”社达到480斤，“红星”社达到490斤。
    三、每个社要有100亩以上的每亩产千斤玉米的高额丰产田。
    四、保证完成国家农产品的采购计划。
    我们3个社所在的地方都是山多地少，土地质量很薄；缺乏水源，并且常有旱、风、虫灾威胁。但是我们转建高级社后也具备了许多有利条件。我们计划充分发挥高级社的优越条件，采取以下基本措施：
    一、3个社社员劳动利用率将比去年提高40％到50％。利用这些劳动潜在力进行大规模的农田基本建设，修河滩，梯田加边垒岸，里切外垫，作到共增加耕地面积400亩。
    二、全部粮食作物地每亩施肥100到115担，比去年增加30％到50％。
    三、打破常规，实行低产变高产、单作变间作和扩大复种。3个社玉米、山药蛋等高产作物播种面积占秋田总播种面积的56％，比去年增加1，295亩；可以实行间作的3，770亩耕地全部间作；扩大复种255亩。
    四、根据山区水源缺乏的情况，3个社今年要开旱渠495条，打旱井130眼，修蓄水池25个，作到山洪浇地面积达到秋田的55％。
    五、普及优良品种。3个社今年播种“金皇后”玉米和“母鸡嘴”谷等要达到粮食作物的90％；并继续推广行之有效的合理密植、玉米人工授粉、玉米药剂灌心、毒饵杀虫等。消灭作物害虫和鼠雀。
    六、能用双铧犁和山地犁进行深耕的耕地全部深耕。
    最后，我们愿意和全国农民一道，在毛主席和上级党委领导下，继续勤俭办社，按照又多、又快、又好、又省的精神，艰苦奋斗，继续争取更大的超额增产成绩。
