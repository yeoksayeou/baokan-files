Xinhua News Agency, January 9th—Beijing Deputy Mayor Jia Tingsan, at a meeting today attended by over 2,600 workers and capitalists, called on everyone to display even greater enthusiasm and successfully complete the task of socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

Today, another 1,276 private factories in Beijing's machinery manufacturing, chemical, dyeing, and printing industries were approved to implement public-private joint ownership by industry.

Jia Tingsan said: The work of public-private joint ownership in Beijing's private industry and commerce has reached a climax, and the socialist enthusiasm of the vast number of workers and capitalists is very high. Some workers' productivity has increased by dozens of percentage points, and some have increased by six or seven times; capitalists have been actively expanding investment. As of yesterday, another two thousand households have applied for public-private joint ownership.

Xinhua News Agency, January 9th—Today, on many bustling streets in Beijing, from noon to night, parades of people celebrating good news were endless, with over 10,000 workers participating. More than 3,000 capitalists also formed nine teams to hold parades. In the past week, more than 3,000 private factories and stores in Beijing have implemented public-private joint ownership.

The parade teams of employees from private enterprises in the four districts of Dongdan, Xidan, Dongsi, and Chongwen all went to the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to report the good news. When the workers' parade team arrived in front of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the leaders of the Municipal Committee and all the staff of the organs came out to welcome them. Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, accepted the good news letter from the workers' representatives and extended cordial congratulations to everyone. The reporting team composed of more than 1,000 capitalists in Dongdan District went to the Dongdan District Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Dongdan District People's Committee to report the good news. Businessmen and industrialists from Xuanwu, Dongsi, Xidan and other districts participated in the parade, holding high banners with slogans such as "Actively Accept Socialist Transformation." Stallholders in Xidan District who are organizing joint operations also formed a parade team of more than 500 people to congratulate the shops and factories that have already implemented public-private joint ownership.

The whole city was filled with joy, and almost every household hung red celebratory banners on bustling streets such as Wangfujing Street and Qianmen Street. Today, all 160 shops in Xidan Fifth Department Store hung red celebratory banners to celebrate public-private joint ownership. Tonight, employees, industrialists and business people, and their families in the Xidan District held grand celebration gatherings at four different locations.

Xinhua News Agency, January 9th—This afternoon and evening, the parade teams of employees from private enterprises in the Xidan, Dongdan, and Dongsi districts of Beijing, celebrating public-private joint ownership, beat gongs and drums and set off firecrackers to report the good news to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

The workers' representatives from Xidan District handed over the good news letter to Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, thanking the Party, the government, and the trade union for leading them to realize their long-awaited desire for public-private joint ownership.

Lai Ruoyu warmly shook hands with the workers and congratulated them. He said: In the past few days, many capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises in Beijing have implemented public-private joint ownership by industry. This is not only a great happy event for you, but also a great happy event for the country. This is beneficial to the country's industrialization and agricultural collectivization. I hope that employees will do a good job in production and operation, assist the public shareholders' representatives, unite and transform the capitalists, and prepare to further transform public-private joint ventures into enterprises owned by the whole people.
