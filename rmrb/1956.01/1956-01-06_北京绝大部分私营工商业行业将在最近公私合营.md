The socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in Beijing will be accelerated, with most sectors implementing joint state-private operation in the near future. This was determined at a meeting convened on January 5th by the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, which invited the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce, trade associations from private commercial and service industries city-wide, and responsible individuals from relevant business departments.

At the meeting, Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, stated: The enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen across all sectors in the city for accepting socialist transformation is growing daily, and the vast majority have submitted applications to implement joint state-private operation. Employees of private enterprises are welcoming joint state-private operation with new work achievements. Each sector should swiftly establish joint state-private operation working committees composed of representatives from state-owned specialized companies, industry trade associations, and employees, to uniformly lead the implementation of joint state-private operation across all industries. The chairmen and vice-chairmen of the various trade associations unanimously endorsed the government's measure in their speeches.

Currently, the work of implementing joint state-private operation in Beijing's capitalist industry is also actively underway. In recent days, various local industry bureaus have dispatched many work teams to factories. A large number of cadres have already arrived at over a thousand private factories. Employees have hung up long-prepared red banners with the words "Welcoming Joint State-Private Operation" and large "Happiness" characters. Capitalists are also elated and actively introducing the situation of their factories to the work teams.

The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions has already determined a plan for the work of trade unions in private enterprises. Trade unions in various districts are training over 13,000 trade union cadres and activists from private factories, who will cooperate with the trade unions to mobilize all employees of private enterprises to assist the work teams in doing a good job of inventorying assets and verifying capital, while also improving production and business operations.

　　北京绝大部分私营工商业行业将在最近公私合营
    北京市对私营工商业的社会主义改造工作将加速进行，绝大部分行业将在最近时期内实行公私合营。这是1月5日北京市人民委员会邀集北京市工商业联合会和全市私营商业和服务性行业的同业公会以及各有关业务主管部门负责人举行的会议上确定的。
    在这个会议上，北京市副市长程宏毅说：全市各行业的工商业者接受社会主义改造的热情日益高涨，绝大部分提出了实行公私合营的申请。私营企业的职工们正以新的工作成就迎接公私合营。各个行业应迅速成立由国营专业公司、行业同业公会和职工三方面的代表组成的公私合营工作委员会，统一领导全行业实行公私合营。各个同业公会的主任委员和副主任委员在发言中，一致拥护政府这一措施。
    目前，北京市对资本主义工业的公私合营工作也正在积极进行。连日来，各地方工业局已经派出很多工作组下厂。大批干部已经到了一千多户私营工厂。职工们挂出了准备已久的标着迎接公私合营字样的横幅红布和大“喜”字。资本家也兴高采烈，积极向工作组介绍工厂的情况。
    北京市工会联合会已经确定了私营企业工会工作的计划。各区工会正在训练13，000多个私营工厂的工会干部和积极分子，他们将配合工会发动私营企业全体职工协助工作组做好清产核资工作，同时改进生产和营业。
