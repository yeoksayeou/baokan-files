　　It's Not Winter, It's Spring
    Tao Dun
    Looking out from the car window, the leaves of the poplar trees on both sides of the road have withered. In previous years, this season was the time when the crops were cleared from the fields, and the farmers were squatting on warm brick beds, looking after their wives and children, drinking hot porridge, waiting for the Spring Festival to pass and the fields to thaw before going to the fields for spring plowing. But now the situation is different. Everywhere in the fields on both sides of the road, people are working: ten-inch walking plows and double-wheeled double-furrow plows are busy with winter plowing; "鸳鸯礶" (Yuanyang Guan - a type of waterwheel), large paddle waterwheels, and Liberation-style waterwheels are busy watering the wheat; sun-dried adobe bricks, stacked like a city wall, are drying in the sun, which agricultural cooperatives are preparing to build houses; men and women are all laboring in the fields. This scene makes travelers feel that it is not winter, but spring.
    This is the new atmosphere that has emerged on both sides of the Tai'an-Laiwu Highway in Shandong Province after Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the Seventh Central Committee's Sixth Plenary Session's "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" were issued. In order to respond to the call of the Shandong Provincial People's Congress to increase the yield per mu of sweet potatoes by ten thousand catties, grain by one thousand catties, peanuts by one thousand catties, and cotton by one hundred catties, the cooperative members are actively taking action to turn winter idleness into winter busyness.
    As soon as I got off the bus, I went to Wangjia Fangxia Village. This village is located on the north side of the highway, fifteen miles away from Laiwu City, on the north bank of the Dawen River.
    It really has changed so much that I can hardly recognize it. Before liberation, this was a poor village. In the words of Wang Dengfu, the director of the village's agricultural cooperative, there were seven "many" things in the village: many beggars, many people fleeing famine, many debtors, many hired laborers, many wheelbarrow pushers, many food sellers, and many bachelors. In 1952, this village established a cooperative. After more than three years, seven new "many" things have emerged: more income, more livestock, more tiled houses being built, more new clothes being worn, more children going to school, more flashlights, more sneakers, and more people getting married. When the cooperative was established in 1952, this was still a grain-deficient village, and seven households still relied on government relief. In 1953, all the villagers joined the cooperative, except for one household of a controlled element. In that year, the cooperative achieved increased production, and their cooperative became the banner of Laiwu County. Their high-yielding wheat field attracted people from all districts of the county, who came to visit. In 1955, in addition to selling 12,500 catties of grain to the state, each person averaged 450 catties of grain (not including sweet potatoes), and they could also get five hundred catties of vegetables, 30 catties of flax, and 11 catties of seed cotton. A grain-deficient village has become a surplus grain village. Wang Yigong's mother's single jacket weighing three catties (patched and re-patched) has become a historical memory. Three years ago, only one church in the village was a tile-roofed house, and many dilapidated thatched houses were tilted and crooked. Now five or six tile-roofed houses have been built, and the thatched houses have been renovated. Branch committee member Pan Demei's family never had a wall, but now they have not only built a wall but also built a large gatehouse. When I saw another row of tile-roofed houses outside the village and asked whose house it was, branch committee member Wang Dedi playfully said, "That's the old Zhu family." Immediately, a cooperative member explained that it was a row of pigsties, raising fat pigs, sows, and also Soviet-bred white pigs.
    The second day I arrived in this village was the 70th birthday of Wang Dedi's father. Five sons and one daughter were all busy celebrating his birthday. Men and women were divided into two tables, each table set with six bowls of dishes, with chicken, meat, fine vermicelli, and two bottles of wine. The old man raised his wine glass, looked at his children and grandchildren, and was so happy that he couldn't stop talking. He said, "Ten years ago, when I was 60 years old, I only had this row of houses, and I still couldn't live in peace. I was forced to hide here and there by the Japanese devils and traitors. If it weren't for the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, where would we be today! This glass of wine should be offered to Chairman Mao." He looked at the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in front of him, nodded, and drank the wine. After three glasses of wine were in his belly, the old man was even more talkative: "The year before last, when we established the cooperative, Dedi did a high-yield experiment on my land, wanting to harvest four hundred catties of wheat. I have been planting that piece of land for 30 years, and I know its bottom. All the soil below one foot is white sand, how can it yield four hundred catties! Who knew that after watering it a few times and hoeing it a few times, it yielded 415 catties. It's really amazing! The cooperative has a way." During the meal, several daughters-in-law were holding steamed buns and asking the old man to eat one, making the old man so happy that he couldn't close his mouth.
    However, people are not satisfied. In the spring of 1955, the cooperative members were already brewing the idea of ​​transitioning to an advanced cooperative. They discussed it for three nights, and everyone unanimously requested to transition to an advanced cooperative. They reported this request to the township government, which forwarded it to the district, which forwarded it to the county, which forwarded it to the special commissioner's office, but received no response. After Chairman Mao reported "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," Secretary Liu of the prefectural committee and Secretary Yang of the county committee personally came to Wangjia Fangxia Village to understand the situation. Except for three households with weak labor power who had difficulties in canceling land shares, the remaining 48 households had no problems. If attention was paid to adjusting light work for those with weak labor power, the problem could be solved. The higher authorities approved the transition of the Wangjia Fangxia Agricultural Cooperative to an advanced cooperative. After this news spread to the village, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members was very high. In the words of Comrade Gao of the technical guidance station, "It almost broke the house."
    When discussing the establishment of an advanced cooperative, some cooperative members said: "Don't just talk about the conservative thinking of our superiors, let's also examine our own conservative thinking!" They examined the cooperative's water conservancy work: "Last year, we decided to eliminate dry land. Have we eliminated it? There are still eight mu of land on the southwest slope that cannot be irrigated. Is this not conservative thinking?" Some cooperative members examined the cooperative's pig raising and fertilizer accumulation: "We only have more than 70 pigs now. The plan for 1956 is to raise 102 pigs. I understand, this is calculated by household. There are 51 households in our village, which is equivalent to two pigs per household. Didn't the director convey the achievements of Song Changsheng Cooperative in Yanggu in raising pigs? They have one pig per person, not two pigs per household." There is also conservative thinking in wheat production. The cooperative members talked about the high yield of 415 catties in 1952 and the failure of creating a thousand-catties record in 1953 due to black rust disease, which still yielded 550 catties per mu, proving that the land still has great potential that has not been fully exploited, which aroused everyone's research on soil fertility. Some cooperative members cited examples: "In 1953, we deep-plowed six to eight inches, and this year we are still planting wheat at six to eight inches, without deep-plowing at all. Some people have deep-plowed to one foot."
    Before transitioning to an advanced cooperative, the cooperative members made a comprehensive plan for production. There is a sandy beach outside the dike of the Dawen River south of the village. Three years ago, a row of trees was planted along the water to protect the sandy beach, which is now covered with weeds. They plan to build another dike outside the big dike to block the water and reclaim the sandy beach to plant fruit trees. Before the trees grow up, they will plant peanuts and sweet potatoes first, so that this village will increase by nearly one hundred mu of land. Their ancestral graves, which are just small mounds covered with weeds, have also been cleared of weeds and planted with apple trees. The cooperative members said: "Let our ancestors see flowers in spring and fruits in autumn, and also live a socialist life!"
    All the land in the village has been connected into one piece, and the land of other villages interspersed in it is being adjusted. In the vast fields, high land has been leveled and low land has been filled in. The small roads in the fields that are not needed are planted with crops, and the roads to be walked on are widened so that rubber-wheeled carts and cars can pass. The bends in the roads have been straightened, saving time and distance in transporting crops. Now the cooperative members are transporting soil, preparing to pad the pens for raising livestock, and also transporting adobe bricks. In the spring, the cooperative will build offices and livestock pens. Carts are running one after another, and people are working like happy tigers. They are doing all the preparatory work in winter to welcome the great increase in production in 1956.

　　不是冬天是春天
    陶钝
    从汽车窗里往外看，公路两边的杨树叶都凋零了。在往年，这季节正是禾净场光，农民们蹲在热炕头上，守着老婆孩子，喝着热糊糊，他们正等待过了春节，田里解冻后才下地春耕。可是现在情况不同了，公路两边的田野里到处都有人在干活：十吋步犁、双轮双铧犁在忙着冬耕；鸳鸯礶、大拨齿水车、解放式水车在忙着浇麦子；打好的土坯像一列城墙似地垒起来晒着，这是农业合作社为了盖房屋准备的；男男女女都在田野里劳动。这景象，使旅客们觉得这不是冬天，倒像是春天。
    这是毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党中央七届六中全会“关于农业合作化问题的决议”下达以后，在山东泰莱公路两边出现的新气象。合作社的社员们为了响应山东省人民代表大会发出的每亩地增产万斤地瓜、千斤粮食、千斤花生、百斤棉花的号召，积极地行动起来，把冬闲变为冬忙。
    我一下车就到王家方下村。这个村就在公路的北边，离莱芜城十五里，在大汶河的北岸。
    这里的确变得使我不认识了。解放以前，这是个穷村子。用这村的农业社社长王登福的话说，村子里有七多：讨饭的多，逃荒的多，欠债的多，当雇工的多，推脚的多，卖饭的多，光棍汉多。1952年这村办了社，经过三年多，出现了新七多：收入多，牲畜多，盖瓦屋的多，穿新衣的多，上学的多，手电筒多，球鞋多，娶媳妇的多。1952年办社的时候，这里还是一个缺粮村，有七户人家还靠政府救济。1953年，全村除一户管制分子没有入社以外，都入社了。这一年，社里得到了增产，他们的社成为莱芜县的旗帜。他们的小麦丰产地，吸引了全县各区的人们，都来参观。1955年，除了卖给国家12，500斤粮食外，每人平均分粮450斤（地瓜还不算在内），还可以分到五百斤菜、30斤线麻、11斤籽棉，一个缺粮村变成余粮村了。王义功的娘一件三斤重（补了又补）的单褂子，已经成为历史性的记忆了；三年前村子里只有一座教堂是瓦房，许多破旧的草屋东倒西歪，现在五、六处瓦房盖起来了，草屋翻新了。支部委员潘德美家从来没有垣墙，现在不但修起了垣墙，还盖了一座大门楼。当我看到村外另一列瓦房问是谁家的时候，支部委员王德弟调皮地说：“那是老朱家。”马上就有一位社员解释说那是一列猪栏，养着肥猪，母猪，还有苏联种的白猪。
    我到这个村子的第二天，是王德弟的父亲70寿辰，五个儿子，一个闺女都忙着给他做寿。男女分成两桌，每桌摆上六碗菜，有鸡，有肉，有细粉条，还有两瓶酒。老人家端起酒杯来，看了看满堂儿女，喜欢得话说不完了。他说：“十年前我60岁，那时只有这一排屋，还住不安稳。被鬼子汉奸逼得东躲西藏。要不是共产党和毛主席领导，那里会有今天！这杯酒应当敬毛主席。”他望着正面挂的毛主席像点了点头，把酒喝下去。老人家三杯酒落到肚里，谈兴更高了：“前年办社，德弟在我那块地里搞丰产试验，要打四百斤小麦。那块地我种了30年，我摸底。下去一尺土全是白沙，那里能打四百斤！谁知浇了几水，锄了几遍，打了415斤。真是奇！合作社是有办法。”在吃饭的时候，几个儿媳妇都端着馍馍让老人吃一个，把老人喜欢得合不拢嘴。
    但是，人们并不满足。1955年春天，社员们就酝酿着转高级社，他们讨论了三晚上，全体一致要求转高级社。他们把这要求报到乡政府，乡转到区，区转到县，县转到专署，没有得到回答。当毛主席报告了“关于农业合作化问题”以后，地委刘书记、县委杨书记亲自到王家方下村来了解情况。这个社除了三户劳动力弱的，取消了地股有困难以外，其余的48户都没有问题，如果注意把轻活调整给劳力弱的来干，问题就能解决。上级批准了王家方下农业合作社转入高级社。这消息传到村里以后，社员们的情绪高涨得很，用技术指导站高同志的话来说：“差点把房子冲破。”
    在讨论办高级社的时候，有的社员说：“不要光讲我们上级的保守思想了，也检查检查我们自己的保守思想吧！”他们检查了社里的水利工作：“去年我们就决定消灭旱田，消灭了没有？西南坡还有八亩地不能浇水，这是不是保守思想？”有的社员检查了社里的养猪、积肥的情况：“我们现在只有70多口猪，1956年计划上订的是养102口；我明白，这是按户算的，咱村51户，每户合两口。社长不是传达了阳谷宋长生合作社养猪的成绩吗？人家是每人一口猪，不是每户两口。”在小麦产量上也存在着保守思想。社员们把1952年高产415斤，1953年创造千斤纪录遭了黑疸病没有成功、每亩还收550斤的数字讲出来，证明土地潜力还很大，还没有全挖掘出来，引起了大家对地力的研究。有的社员举出了实例：“1953年咱深耕六至八寸，今年种麦还是六至八寸，一点也没有深耕下去，人家有的深耕到一尺了。”
    社员们在转为高级社以前，对生产作了全面规划。村子南边大汶河的堰外有一片沙滩，三年前靠水沿栽过一列树，护住了沙滩，长满了杂草。他们计划着在大堰以外再筑一道堰挡住水，把沙滩的荒开出来栽上果子树。树没长起来以前，先种花生和地瓜，使这村子增加将近一百亩地。他们的祖坟，只是一些小土堆堆，长满了乱草，他们也铲了乱草栽上了苹果树。社员们说：“让我们的祖先春天看花，秋天看果，也过一过社会主义生活吧！”
    全村的土地已经连成一片了，夹杂着的外村的土地正在进行调整。广阔的田野里，高地铲平了，低地填起了。田间的小道，不需要的就耕种上庄稼，要走的路加宽了，可以走胶皮轮大车和汽车了。道路的弯伸直了，节省了搬运庄稼的时间和路程。现在社员们正在运土，预备养牲畜垫栏，同时也在运坯，开春，社要建造办公室和牲畜栏。小车子一辆接一辆，人像欢虎似地干着活。他们冬天把一切准备工作做好，迎接1956年的大增产。
