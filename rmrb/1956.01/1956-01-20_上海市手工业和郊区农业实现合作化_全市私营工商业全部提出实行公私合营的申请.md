    (Our newspaper, Shanghai, 19th dispatch) By today, all of Shanghai's more than 90,000 handicraftsmen have embarked on the road of cooperation. On the 19th, more than 10,000 members of new and old handicraft production cooperatives held a grand rally at the Cultural Square to celebrate the victory of Shanghai's handicraft industry's cooperation. Ma Tianshui, Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Song Richang, Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and others spoke at the meeting, congratulating the city's handicraftsmen.
    Shanghai's handicraft industry achieved cooperation in just four days, shortening the original plan of the responsible department by nearly two years. In the process of applying to organize cooperatives, handicraftsmen expressed their urgent desire to take the road of cooperation. Starting from the 16th, handicraftsmen from various districts lined up, beat gongs and drums, and submitted applications and letters of determination to the responsible departments. Forty-four woodcarving handicraftsmen in Hongkou District also took out savings of 885 yuan and invested them in production as a gift to cooperation.
    (Our newspaper, Shanghai, 18th dispatch) The task of socialist transformation of agriculture in the suburbs of Shanghai has been successfully completed.
    More than 2,800 peasant representatives, representing 380,000 farmers in the suburbs of Shanghai, held a representative meeting of suburban agricultural production cooperatives today at the Shanghai Sino-Soviet Friendship Building. Zhang Yaoxiang, Director of the Shanghai Suburban Farmers Association, and representatives from various suburbs spoke at the meeting, unanimously requesting the establishment of advanced agricultural production cooperatives. The peasant representatives also submitted many applications to the podium. Before the meeting today, more than 1,100 elementary cooperatives that had not yet established advanced cooperatives, except for a few individual cooperatives that did not apply, all submitted applications. Dong Quan, a representative of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, approved all the applications on the spot, and there was a burst of cheers, and the whole audience shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!"
    The meeting finally adopted a letter of guarantee to the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, and a congratulatory letter to the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions. After the meeting, there was a parade and good news was reported to the leading organs of Shanghai.
    (Our newspaper, Shanghai, 19th dispatch) As of the 18th, all 242 private industrial and commercial sectors in Shanghai had submitted applications for joint public-private ownership of the entire industry. In this way, the resolution of the Shanghai Municipal Industrial and Commercial Circles Temporary Representative Meeting to strive to complete the application for joint public-private ownership of private industrial and commercial enterprises in the city on the 20th was achieved two days ahead of schedule.
    (Our newspaper, Shanghai, 17th dispatch) Shanghai's literary and art workers have actively taken action to participate in the upsurge of socialist transformation and launch creative activities. On the evening of the 16th, the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles convened a mobilization meeting, and the 140 literary and art workers who attended the meeting all expressed their willingness to actively participate in the upsurge of socialist transformation. The Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles and other literary and art groups have established a joint office to organize and assist literary and art workers to participate in the work of socialist transformation in factories, shops, and suburban rural areas, experience life, and carry out creation. Some musicians, poets, and painters have recently created many songs and sketches, and have been successively published in Shanghai newspapers.
