The handicraftsmen of Shanghai have realized socialist cooperation. In the upsurge of Shanghai's handicraft cooperation, many vivid stories are being spread.

The "?"-Character Carpet

In the handicraftsmen's contingent participating in the Shanghai Municipal Celebration of the Victory of Socialist Transformation, a sea of red "?" characters surged. The Xuhui District Handicraft Production Cooperative had a unique sign: it was woven from wool. This was a gift rushed out overnight by the carpet workers for the conference.

Yue Chongming, a carpet weaver, followed behind the "?"-character carpet, looking very happy. More than twenty years ago, when he was an apprentice, he saw that the lives of carpet weavers were unstable, and the master craftsmen had to move two or three times a year with their bedding on their backs. He thought: If the state opened a carpet factory, the lives of the carpet weavers wouldn't be so miserable. However, in the old society, this was a dream. After he finished his apprenticeship, for decades, like all carpet weavers, he changed professions every few years, working as a road repairer, pulling a dung cart, and selling vegetables. For decades, his life had no security at all.

Now, the carpet weavers have organized a cooperative, and Yue Chongming is overjoyed. The day before attending the conference, the worker representatives discussed what gift to present to the conference. He said: "We carpet workers only know how to weave carpets. We used to weave for others, but today we will weave one for ourselves to celebrate." So, the carpet workers brought a brightly colored "?"-character carpet to participate in the conference.

Wan Zhichu's Happy Event

Near the City God Temple in Nanshi, Shanghai, there is an old worker named Wan Zhichu who makes the pipa. He learned a good set of skills for making pipas from his father when he was young. The pipas he made were beautiful and had accurate tones, and were well-known domestically. Music groups and theater troupes from all over the country liked to buy the pipas he made, and letters ordering pipas flew in like snowflakes. However, it took Wan Zhichu ten or so days to make a pipa. Even if he worked day and night, he couldn't finish them all. What to do? He discussed it with several colleagues time and time again, wanting to join forces to produce together, but it never succeeded.

Now, Wan Zhichu's long-awaited ideal has been realized. On the evening of the 16th of this month, he heard that Shanghai's handicrafts were also going to achieve cooperation like Beijing, so he wrote an application for membership overnight and sent it to the Handicraft Cooperative Office.

Nuns Join the Cooperative

In the ranks of handicraftsmen, a small team of Catholic nuns dressed in black appeared. Why did the nuns come to the meeting? Everyone couldn't help but ask curiously. "They also joined the cooperative," the representatives from Xuhui District replied.

The situation is this: After the Shanghai public security organs cleared out the Gong Pinmei counter-revolutionary clique hidden in the Catholic Church, the nuns in Xuhui District actively requested to participate in labor. Some time ago, the city's labor embroidery production cooperative often gave them some embroidery work to do. These days, the upsurge of handicraft cooperation has arrived, and gongs and drums are sounding loudly in the streets and alleys. Sister Li Xiuqing discussed with everyone and said: "The upsurge of socialist construction has arrived, and we must also contribute a share!" As a result of the discussion, everyone decided to join the cooperative. Many elderly nuns also have a high enthusiasm for joining the cooperative. They said: "Our ears are not sensitive, but our eyesight is still very good, and we are good at embroidery work." On the afternoon of the 19th, they wrote guarantee letters and red "?" characters, and participated in the Labor Embroidery Cooperative members' meeting. They were welcomed by all the old members, and 15 people were admitted as members on the spot.

    手工业者的愿望实现了
    薛镍
    上海市手工业劳动者已经实现了社会主义合作化。上海手工业合作化的高潮中，传播着许多生动的故事。
    “?”字地毯
    在参加上海市庆祝社会主义改造胜利大会的手工业者队伍里，大红的?字像潮水一样涌来。徐汇区手工业品生产合作社有块牌子，与众不同：它是用羊毛织成的。这是地毯工人连夜赶出来给大会的礼物。
    织地毯的工人岳崇明跟在“?”字地毯的后面，显得兴高采烈。他在二十多年前学生意的时候，看到织地毯的工人生活不安定，老师傅们背着铺盖一年要搬两三次家。他想：要是国家开个地毯工厂，织地毯的工人生活就不会这样受苦了。可是，在旧社会，这是一个梦想。他满师之后，几十年来，也和所有织地毯的工人一样，三年两头改行，当过修马路的小工，拉过粪车，卖过小菜，几十年来，生活没有一点保障。
    现在，织地毯的工人组织了合作社，岳崇明高兴得心里开了花。出席大会的前一天，工人代表讨论用什么礼物向大会献礼。他说：“我们地毯工人就会织地毯。过去给人家织，今天也给自己织一块庆祝庆祝。”于是，地毯工人就带了色彩鲜艳的“?”字地毯来参加大会了。
    万之初的喜事
    在上海南市城隍庙附近，有一个做琵琶的老工人万之初，他从小在父亲手里学会一套做琵琶的好手艺。做的琵琶又漂亮，音又准，在国内很有名。各地的音乐团、剧团都喜欢买他做的琵琶，订制琵琶的信像雪片一样飞来。可是，万之初做一把琵琶要花十来天，就是日夜不休息，也做不完。怎么办呢？他一次又一次地和几个同业商量，想和大家合伙一起生产，但是始终没有成功。
    现在，万之初盼望了多年的理想实现了。本月16日晚上，他听说上海手工业也要像北京一样实现合作化了，就连夜写了入社申请书，送到手工业合作社办事处去。
     修女入社
    在手工业劳动者的队伍里，出现了一小队穿戴黑色衣服的天主教修女。修女怎么来开会呢？大家不禁好奇地问。“她们也参加合作社了。”徐汇区的代表们这样回答。
    事情是这样的：上海市公安机关清除了暗藏在天主教内的龚品梅反革命集团以后，徐汇区修女都积极要求参加劳动。前些日子，市里的劳动刺绣生产合作社经常拿些刺绣活给她们做。这些天来，手工业的合作化高潮到了，大街小巷锣鼓敲得震天响，修女李秀清和大家商量着说：“社会主义建设高潮到了，我们也要尽一分力量才好啊！”商量的结果，大家决心参加合作社。许多年老的修女要求入社的情绪也很高。她们说：“我们耳朵不灵，眼光还很好，绣花的生活是做得好的。”19日下午，她们写了保证书、红?字，参加劳动刺绣社社员大会，受到全体老社员的欢迎，当场有15个人被吸收入了社。
