Xinhua News Agency, January 6th, London, January 6th (TASS): The British weekly "Tribune" published an article by Labour MP Brockway, discussing the recent negotiations for the cessation of military operations in Malaya. The author wrote that these negotiations "are not negotiations between free men. The Chief Ministers of Malaya and Singapore are not yet masters in their own houses. Supreme command is in the hands of the British."

The author also pointed out: "When the Chief Ministers took the initiative in expressing their willingness to meet with the Communist leaders, the British exerted pressure to turn these negotiations into a pretext for surrender. The British army and generals play a leading role in the war. The defense and security of Malaya are under British control. Under these circumstances, how can Rahman and Marshall negotiate like free and autonomous people? However, things will not always be like this."

Brockway warned against attempts to ban the Malayan Communist Party.

　　英国一工党议员评马来亚停止军事行动的谈判
    新华社6日讯　塔斯社伦敦6日讯：英国“论坛”周报刊载了工党议员布罗克威的一篇文章，谈到最近举行的关于马来亚停止军事行动的谈判。作者写道，这些谈判“不是自由人之间的谈判。马来亚和新加坡的首席部长们还不是自己家里的主人。最高指挥权是在英国人手里”。
    作者还指出：“当首席部长们对同共产党领袖会晤这件事表示主动的时候，英国人施加压力以便把这些谈判变成一种投降的托辞。英国军队和将领在战争中起主导作用。马来亚的防御和安全是在英国人的控制下的。在这种情况下，拉赫曼和马歇尔如何能像自由和自主的人那样进行谈判呢？但是，事情不会始终是这样的。”
    布罗克威警告说，有人企图禁止马来亚共产党。
