Everyone Get Involved and Eliminate Rats

Shou Zhenhuang, Researcher, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences

There are many types of rodent pests. In addition to the three types of house rats, there are over a hundred types of wild rats. In our country, rodents, excluding larger species like marmots and porcupines, can be called wild rats. They steal seeds, bite off seedlings, gnaw at tree bark, and destroy pasture, causing enormous damage to agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production. Some human infectious diseases are caused by wild rat infections, so wild rats also seriously endanger people's health. Since there are many kinds of wild rats, and their living habits are very different; although the methods of eliminating them are similar in principle; the specific measures are different. This is not something that can be explained clearly in one article. This article focuses on house rats and methods for eliminating them.

There are three types of house rats: one is the brown rat, also called the Norway rat, which is a common rat. It is widely distributed and good at burrowing holes and digging ditches. Its body length (including tail length) is over a foot, and its weight is about half a kilogram or more. The largest female rat weighs one kilogram, and the male rat even exceeds one kilogram. The body is stout, the nose is blunt and round, the tail is thick, and the tail length is less than the total length of the head and body. The second type is the black rat, also called the roof rat or ship rat. It is mostly found in coastal docks and South China, and likes to climb roofs or other high places. The body length is over a foot, and the weight is about half a kilogram. The body is relatively slender, the nose is sharp, the tail is thin and long, and the tail length is greater than the total length of the head and body. The third type is the house mouse, also known as the shrew mouse. It is very small, with a body length of about four inches and a weight of half to one and a half taels. It has large ears and a thin, long tail.

House rats are mostly active at night. About half an hour after dark, young rats come out to forage first. An hour later, larger rats also begin to forage. Rats have very sensitive hearing and are exceptionally alert. They run away immediately upon hearing a very slight sound. They eat twice every night, once after dark and once before dawn.

Rats have a strong reproductive capacity. If their living conditions are good, they can mate all year round. Young rats mature and reproduce after three months. The reproductive function of rats can be maintained until one and a half or two years old, and senescence appears in the third year. Rats give birth to as few as three or four young per litter, and as many as ten or more, with a maximum of 22, and an average of about eight or nine per litter. The gestation period is 21 to 25 days, and the female rat can mate immediately after giving birth. Under normal circumstances, female rats produce an average of five or six litters per year.

The number of house rats fluctuates, sometimes increasing and sometimes decreasing, showing a cyclical phenomenon, depending on the amount of food available or other environmental influences.

The situation of house rats stealing food is very serious. House mice eat an average of more than ten centimeters of food per day, and the consumption of two house mice is approximately equal to the consumption of one large rat. However, the number of house mice is not large, and the proportion is small. Large rats (brown rats) eat an average of 25 centimeters per day, totaling 750 centimeters (equivalent to 1.5 jin) per month, calculated at 30 days per month, and a total of 18 jin per year.

In addition to eating large amounts of grain, rats also waste a lot of grain. Although most of the grain they waste can be eaten after conditioning and cleaning, the amount of loss is still considerable.

The range of house rat activity is very wide. From sewers to kitchens, from toilets to warehouses, from garbage dumps to food stores. Their feet and fur are covered with bacteria, and their intestines harbor worms. They not only transmit diseases to humans and animals, but sometimes also transmit human and animal diseases to them.

Of the diseases transmitted by house rats, plague is the most dangerous, with a very high mortality rate. During the plague epidemic in Europe in the 14th century, there were 25 million deaths, equivalent to a quarter of the European population. In our country, since liberation, due to the development of the patriotic health movement and vigorous prevention and control work, human plague no longer spreads; however, rat plague still occurs every year. Therefore, the danger of plague has not been fundamentally eliminated.

Diseases transmitted by house rats also include endemic typhus, trichinosis, leptospirosis, rat-bite fever, trench fever, food poisoning (Salmonella), tularemia, rabies, etc. At the same time, they are also transmission vectors for certain pathogenic protozoa, flukes, and tapeworms.

House rats sometimes damage electrical wires and sometimes gnaw on matches, causing huge fires. House rats like to drill holes and make nests, destroying the foundations of houses, and gnawing on clothes, leather goods, doors, windows, furniture, books, soap, etc. Sometimes they bite chickens to death, as many as 188 in one night. There are also records of grown chickens, ducks, or small pigs and lambs being bitten to death by rats. In addition, they often steal feed for livestock and poultry, steal bird eggs, chicken eggs, vegetables, and fruits, and sometimes even bite the noses or ears of infants.

From this point of view, house rats are truly the great enemies of mankind, and everyone should organize to resolutely eliminate them.

There are four methods of rat extermination: mechanical, chemical, bacterial, and biological.

1.  Mechanical Rat Extermination Method: The tools commonly used for catching rats are rat cages and rat traps. These two types of equipment should not be used for too long and should not have any odors, otherwise, the rats will avoid them. Therefore, it is necessary to change the method of rat extermination frequently, and the equipment must be washed with hot water or alkaline water to remove the odor. The bait used to lure the rats must be economical and tasty in order to lure them to eat. The following four types of bait can be tried: Grains - corn, soybeans, and pancakes, preferably with oil; Fish and meat - fresh fish, fatty meat, and meat skin, preferably roasted to increase the aroma; Fruits - apples and bananas, cut into small pieces; Game - animal meat, sparrow heads, etc.

Our working people have accumulated rich experience in the struggle against rodents for a long time and have created many rat-catching methods that are economical and practical. In places where there are no rat-catching tools, the rat-killing methods that the masses are accustomed to should be adopted more.

2.  Chemical Rat Extermination Method: The chemical drugs commonly used are divided into two categories: poisons and repellents. The former is a combination of poison and bait, referred to as poisoned bait; the latter is placed in places where there are rats to make them escape. There are many types of chemical drugs, totaling thousands. Our requirement is that they are harmless or have low toxicity to humans and animals, are effective against house rats; are not expensive, and can be manufactured domestically.

3.  Bacterial Rat Extermination Method: This method is more complicated and should not be widely promoted.

4.  Biological Rat Extermination Method: It is well known that cats can kill rats. In the movement to eliminate rodent pests, the masses should be persuaded to keep cats in every household. Dogs can also catch rats and are natural enemies of rats. Weasels (commonly known as yellow weasels) and other carnivores also prey on rodents. Diurnal eagles and nocturnal owls feed partly on rodents. From the perspective of their diet, they and weasels are beneficial and should be protected.

When starting to catch rats in various places, the masses should be mobilized to do it together; otherwise, if area A starts a large-scale rat-catching campaign and area B does not act, the house rats in area A will migrate to area B. When area B catches rats, area A relaxes again, and the house rats in area B will escape back to area A. In order to prevent house rats from invading from one household to another, every household needs to repair its doors and windows, install iron screens on windows, and block cracks and holes in walls and floors.

In the movement to eliminate rodent pests, scientific workers should strengthen the investigation and research of rodents, study the laws of rodent reproduction and activity, improve the methods of killing and preventing rats, create effective medicines and rat-catching tools, and provide the masses with specific guidance on rat extermination methods, in order to more quickly and thoroughly eliminate rodent pests nationwide.

　　大家一齐动手、消灭鼠害
    中国科学院动物研究室研究员　寿振黄
    害鼠种类很多，除了三种家鼠以外，还有一百几十种野鼠。我国的啮齿动物，除去旱獭、豪猪等形体较大的种类外，其他小形的啮齿动物，都可以叫做野鼠。它们窃食种子，咬断幼苗，啃去树皮，破坏牧草，给农林生产和畜牧事业，带来巨大的损害。人类的某些传染病，是由野鼠感染而来的，所以野鼠又严重地危害着人民的健康。野鼠的种类既多，生活习性也很不相同；消灭它们的方法，原则上虽然相似；但具体措施，便有差别。这不是一篇文章能够说清楚的。这篇文章专谈一谈家鼠和消灭家鼠的方法。
    家鼠有三种：一种是褐鼠，也叫沟鼠，是大家常见的一种老鼠。它分布很广，善于钻洞挖沟。体长（连尾长）在一尺以上，体重约在半斤以上，最大的母鼠有一斤重，公鼠甚至超过一斤。躯体粗大、鼻端圆钝，尾粗大，尾长不及头和躯体的总长。第二种是黑鼠，又叫屋顶鼠或者叫船鼠。多半在沿海码头和华南地区，好攀登屋顶或者其他的高地方。体长在一尺以上，体重约半斤。躯体较细，鼻端尖锐，尾细长，尾长大于头和躯体的总长。第三种是小家鼠，别名鼷鼠。形体很小，体长约四寸，体重半两到一两半，耳大，尾细长。
    家鼠多半在夜间活动，天黑后约半小时，幼鼠先出来活动。一小时后，大鼠也开始活动。老鼠听觉很灵，机警异常。听到很轻的声音，马上逃走。每夜吃食两次，一次在天黑后，一次在黎明前。
    老鼠繁殖力很强。假使它的生活条件好，一年四季都可以交配。幼鼠三个月就能成熟，交配生殖。老鼠的生殖机能可以维持到一岁半或两岁，第三年即呈衰老现象。老鼠每胎生幼鼠少则三、四只，多则十多只，最多达22只，每胎平均数约为八、九只。怀孕期21天到25天，母鼠生产后，马上可以交配。在普通情况下，母鼠每年平均生产五、六次。
    家鼠的数目，由于食物的多少或其他环境的影响，时多时少，呈现一种周期现象。
    家鼠盗食粮食的情形很严重。小家鼠每日平均吃十多公分食物，两只小家鼠的消耗量大约等于一只大家鼠的消耗量。但小家鼠的数目不多，比例较小。大家鼠（褐鼠）每日平均吃25公分，每月以30日计，共吃750公分（合1.5斤），全年共吃18斤。
    老鼠除了吃掉大宗粮食之外，还糟蹋很多粮食。它糟蹋了的粮食虽然大部分经过调理清洁后，可以食用，但损失数目也是相当大的。
    家鼠活动的范围很广。从阴沟到厨房，从厕所到仓库，从垃圾堆到食品商店。它们的脚上和毛上附带着病菌，它们的肠胃寄生着蠕虫。它们不仅把疾病传染给人畜，有时候也把人畜的疾病传染给它们。
    家鼠传染的疾病以鼠疫为最危险，死亡率很高。在14世纪的时候欧洲鼠疫流行，死亡达2，500万人，等于欧洲人口的四分之一。在我国，解放以来，由于爱国卫生运动的开展，以及大力进行防治工作，人间鼠疫，不再蔓延；但鼠间鼠疫，则年年发生。因此，鼠疫的危险性，还没有根本消除。
    家鼠传染的疾病，还有地方性斑疹伤寒、旋毛虫病、螺旋体性黄疸病、鼠咬热、战壕热、食物中毒（沙门氏菌）、士拉伦斯病、狂犬病等，同时它又是某些病源原虫、吸虫和绦虫的传染媒介。
    家鼠有时咬坏电线，有时啃啮火柴，因而引起巨大的火灾。家鼠爱好钻孔做洞，破坏房屋的基础，咬啮衣服、皮件、门窗、家具、书籍、肥皂等等。有时咬死雏鸡，一晚之内，多至188只。成长的鸡鸭，或小猪小羊，也有被鼠咬死的记录。此外，它还经常盗吃家畜和家禽的饲料，窃食鸟卵、鸡卵、蔬菜、水果，有时甚至咬伤婴孩的鼻子或耳朵。
    从这里看，家鼠真是人类的大敌，大家应该组织起来，坚决消灭它。
    灭鼠的方法有器械、化学、细菌、生物等四种。
    一、器械灭鼠法：通常捕鼠的器具，有鼠笼和鼠夹两类。使用这两类器械不能太久，并且不能沾有气味，不然，老鼠就会躲避。因此，必须经常更换灭鼠的方法，器械一定要用热水或碱水冲洗，除掉臭味。引诱的饵料，要经济，并且有滋味，才能诱鼠来吃。以下四种诱饵都可以试用：粮食——玉米、黄豆、面饼，最好加油；鱼肉——鲜鱼、肥肉、肉皮，最好烤熟，增加香味；水果——苹果、香蕉，切成小块；野味——兽肉、麻雀头等。
    我国劳动人民，长期以来在同鼠类作斗争中，积累了丰富的经验，创造出很多捕鼠方法，既经济，又实用。在没有捕鼠器具的地方，应当多采用群众惯于使用的灭鼠方法。
    二、化学灭鼠法：通常所用的化学药品，有毒药和避忌剂二类。前者把毒药和饵料配合，简称毒饵；后者放在有鼠的地方，使鼠逃避。化学药品种类很多，共计有数千种。我们的要求是对人畜无害或毒力小，对家鼠有效；价钱不大，国内可以制造的。
    三、细菌灭鼠法：这种方法比较复杂，不宜广泛推广。
    四、生物灭鼠法：猫能灭鼠，人所共知。在消灭鼠害的运动中，要劝导群众，家家养猫。狗也能捕鼠，是鼠类的天然敌人。黄鼬（俗称黄鼠狼）和其他食肉兽也捕食鼠类。白天活动的鹰类和黑夜活动的枭类（猫头鹰），它们的食物一部分是鼠类。从食性来看，它们和黄鼬等都是有益的，应该受到保护。
    各地在开始捕捉老鼠的时候，应当发动群众一齐动手，不然，如果甲地开始大规模捕捉老鼠，乙地不动的话，甲地的家鼠，就会向乙地迁徙。待乙地捕鼠的时候，甲地又松懈下来，乙地的家鼠，又会逃回甲地。为了避免家鼠从这一家侵入那一家，家家需要修好门户，窗上加装铁纱，堵住墙壁和地板上的裂缝和窟窿。
    在消灭鼠害的运动中，科学工作者应该加强鼠类的调查研究工作，研究鼠类繁殖和活动的规律性，改进杀鼠和防鼠的方法，创造出有效的药剂和捕鼠工具，并且在灭鼠的方法上给群众以具体的指导，以期更迅速地在全国范围内彻底消灭鼠害。
