Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 24th: Kiichiro Yamaguchi, a member of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party Diet who once visited China, delivered a speech on Radio Japan on January 19 entitled "The Hopes of Conservative Politicians for China."

	Kiichiro Yamaguchi said: "Speaking frankly from the standpoint of a Conservative Party Diet member, China recently is not the China of the past in many respects. China's leaders are wholeheartedly striving to move forward for the revitalization of China. We, as Japanese politicians, cannot help but have respect and admiration for this. What impressed me most was the enthusiasm and effort of China's politicians and people to build together through thick and thin, which moved us very much."

	In his speech, Kiichiro Yamaguchi talked about the issue of normalizing relations between Japan and China. He said: "Regarding trade and diplomatic issues between Japan and China, at the time of the end of the war, China was in the position of a victorious nation, and it was natural for China to hope to reopen trade with Japan as soon as possible and restore normal diplomatic relations at an early date. Japan has suffered various restrictions in trade, and Japan has its own difficulties here." "When Japan was negotiating with China and the Soviet Union to restore normal diplomatic relations, Japan was subject to various restrictions from the United States and Britain because Japan was a defeated nation. In this lies Japan's distress, which is my thought."

	Kiichiro Yamaguchi mentioned that there are still various issues to be resolved between Japan and China. He said that from the perspective of the past history of Japan and China, or from the perspective of distance, we should try to restore direct trade between Japan and China in any case. Now there are no barriers between the people of Japan and China, therefore, Japan and China should restore normal transportation, diplomatic, and trade relations as soon as possible on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

	In his speech, Kiichiro Yamaguchi talked about his views and beliefs on peaceful coexistence between China and Japan. He said: "After I visited China and returned to Japan, I gained a new understanding, that is, China will never use force to invade Japan, so there should never be war between Japan and China in the future, and I believe that there will never be war again. I feel that the people of Japan and China should join hands, cherish the awareness of being of the same script and race, and strive for peace in Asia." "When I met with Premier Zhou Enlai, I also keenly felt that, as I said earlier, China has China's ideals, and Japan has Japan's ideals. We should not invade each other and should not interfere in each other's internal affairs. Only on the basis of this principle can international peace be established, and this principle will have no need to be changed in the future."

	In his speech, Kiichiro Yamaguchi talked about Japan and China should increase mutual understanding and knowledge. He said: "The people of Japan and China should stand on an objective standpoint and clearly recognize themselves. For the sake of the future of the two countries, where does Japan have shortcomings, and where does China have areas that should be improved." He advocated that Japan and China should solve the problem of "how to exchange knowledge with each other, and how to enhance understanding between the people of the two countries."

	Kiichiro Yamaguchi finally said: "In the future, Japan and China hope to eliminate the various misunderstandings of the past and should maintain a friendly relationship of sincere cooperation. If this idea can be instilled into the minds of politicians and conscious people in Japan and China, Asian peace and prosperity can certainly be achieved due to the strong connection and cooperation between Japan and China."

    日本自由民主党议员山口喜久一郎发表演说
    谈日本保守派政治家对中国的希望
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：曾经访问过中国的日本自由民主党的国会议员山口喜久一郎1月19日在日本电台发表了一篇题为“保守派政治家对中国的希望”的演说。
    山口喜久一郎说：“本人站在保守党国会议员的立场开诚布公的说，中国最近在各方面已经不是过去的中国了。中国各位指导者一心一意的正为了复兴中国努力前进着，作为日本政治家的我们对于这一点不能不起尊敬和佩服的念头。给本人留下印象最深的就是中国的政治家与人民同甘共苦来建设的热诚和努力，这使我们很受感动。”
    山口喜久一郎在演说中谈到了日本和中国两国关系正常化的问题。他说：“日中两国之间的贸易以及外交问题，在战争终结的当时，中国处在战胜国的地位，中国希望和日本从速重开贸易，早日恢复正常的国交，这是理所当然的。日本在贸易上受了种种限制，在这里日本也有日本的苦衷。”“日本和中国、苏联进行恢复正常邦交的交涉的时候，因为日本曾经是战败国的关系，所以受到英美的种种限制，在这里潜伏着日本的苦恼，这是本人的想法。”
    山口喜久一郎谈到日本和中国两国之间还有种种问题尚待解决。他说，从日中两国过去的历史来看，或者是从距离上来看，无论如何也应该设法恢复日中两国之间的直接贸易。现在日中两国国民之间已经没有任何隔阂了，因此，日中两国应当站在平等互惠的基础上，从速恢复正常的交通、外交和贸易关系。
    山口喜久一郎在演说中谈到他对中日两国和平共处的看法和信念。他说：“本人视察中国回到日本以后得到一种新的认识，就是中国绝对不会用武力来侵略日本，所以日中两国之间今后绝对不应该再起战争，并且本人相信，以后也再不会有战争。本人感觉到日中两国国民应当携起手来，抱有同文同种民族的自觉，为了亚洲的和平而奋斗。”“当本人和周恩来总理会见的时候，也痛感到像刚才所说过的，中国抱有中国的理想，日本具有日本的理想，彼此之间互不侵犯，互相不干涉对方国的内政，只有以这原则为基础，才能确立国际之间的和平，就是将来这原则也毫无改变的必要。”
    山口喜久一郎在演说中谈到日中两国应该增进相互间的了解和认识。他说：“日中两国国民应当站在客观的立场上清醒地认识自己，为了两国的将来，日本在那一方面有缺点，中国在那一方面有应该改善的地方。”他主张日本和中国之间应当解决“怎样来互相交换知识，怎样来增进两国国民之间的理解”的问题。
    山口喜久一郎最后说：“今后日中两国之间希望能消除过去的种种误解，应该保持着诚心合作的友好关系。这种想法如果能灌输到日中两国的政治家和有觉悟的人们的头脑里，亚洲的和平、繁荣由于日中强有力的联系和合作，是一定可以达成的。”
