    Unattended Angle Iron
    In 1953, the Kunming Geological Exploration Company transported 43,000 kilograms of angle iron from other places and piled it in the Kunming Drilling Machine Factory. Over the years, after being exposed to wind and rain, this batch of angle iron, except for a portion that the Drilling Machine Factory applied to use, has rusted, deteriorated, and is covered with "spots."
    Recently, the youth supervision post of the Drilling Machine Factory exposed this problem and demanded that the Geological Exploration Company handle it quickly. At first, they did not admit that this batch of angle iron was theirs. Later, after careful inspection and verification by the youth supervision post of the Drilling Machine Factory, they admitted that there was such a thing. However, they used the excuse that the warehouse was not properly built and could not be handled. Afterwards, under the repeated urging of the youth supervision post, they promised to send someone "tomorrow" to study the handling, but the next day, no one paid any attention to it.
    This attitude of indifference to state property is intolerable.

    无人过问的三角铁
    昆明地质勘探公司在1953年从外地运来43，000公斤的三角铁，堆放在昆明钻机厂里。几年来，经过风吹雨打，这批三角铁，除了钻机厂申请动用的一部分以外，都已经生锈变质，长满了“麻点”。
    最近，钻机厂的青年监督岗揭发了这个问题，要求地质勘探公司迅速处理。起初，他们不承认这批三角铁是他们的。后来，经过钻机厂青年监督岗的认真检查对证，他们才承认了有这么一回事情。但是，他们借口仓库没有盖好，不能处理。此后，在青年监督岗的再三督促下，他们答应“明天”派人去研究处理，可是到了第二天，依然无人过问。
    这种对国家资财漠不关心的态度，是令人不能容忍的。
