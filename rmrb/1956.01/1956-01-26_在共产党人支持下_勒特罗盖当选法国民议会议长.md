Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 25th -- According to TASS: The French National Assembly held a meeting on January 24, presided over by the oldest member, Jacques Duclos (Communist), to elect the President of the National Assembly. As a result of the election, the Socialist Party's Le Troquer was elected President with the support of the Communists.

The candidates nominated for President were Communist Jacques Duclos, Socialist Party's Le Troquer, Popular Republican Party's Schneiter, and Radical politician Rives-Henrys. In the first and second rounds of voting, no one obtained an absolute majority. By the second round, the Communist parliamentary group, considering that Duclos had received more votes than Le Troquer in the first round, suggested that the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party support Duclos in the second round. However, these two parties refused. The Communist Party then issued a statement, pointing out that in order to defeat the reactionary candidates, to thwart any attempts by the parties of the "Republican Front" to compromise with right-wing parties, and to promote the unity of democratic forces at home, the Communist parliamentary group decided to withdraw Duclos's nomination and instead vote for the Socialist candidate Le Troquer in the third round. Therefore, Le Troquer was elected with 280 votes.

    在共产党人支持下
    勒特罗盖当选法国民议会议长
    新华社25日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国国民议会1月24日在最年长的议员加香（共产党）主持下举行会议，选举国民议会议长。选举结果，社会党的勒特罗盖在共产党支持下当选议长。
    被提名为议长候选人的有共产党人加香、社会党人勒特罗盖、人民共和党人施奈特和布热德分子吕夫。在第一、二两次投票中，谁都没有获得绝对多数票，到第二次投票时，共产党议会党团考虑到加香在第一次投票中得票比勒特罗盖多，就建议社会党人和激进社会党人在第二次投票中支持加香。但是这两个党拒绝了。共产党于是发表声明，指出共产党议会党团为了击败反动派的候选人，为了击破“共和阵线”各党派同右翼党派妥协的任何企图以促进国内民主力量的团结，决定取消加香的提名，而在第三次投社会党候选人勒特罗盖的票。因此，勒特罗盖得以280票当选。
