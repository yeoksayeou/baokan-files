    First Tractor Manufacturing Plant
    Exceeds Last Year's Construction Plan
    (Our newspaper's report) The First Tractor Manufacturing Plant's factory building project, which commenced in 1955, comprehensively fulfilled the annual basic construction plan on December 31st, exceeding it by 35.04%. On the vast factory base, magnificent factory buildings for auxiliary workshops and repair and casting workshops have already been erected; the huge concrete foundations of the forging workshop have also all emerged above ground.
    In order to complete the tractor factory ahead of schedule, the construction workers launched a labor emulation drive and promoted advanced work methods. For example, the Shi Xuecheng group learned from the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's experience in pouring concrete column foundations and created the "center-convex layered segmented pouring method," which increased work efficiency from 17% above quota to 40% above quota.

    第一拖拉机制造厂
    超额完成去年建设计划
    本报讯　第一拖拉机制造厂1955年开工的厂房工程，在12月31日超额35.04％全面完成了年度基本建设计划。在广大的厂区基地上，已经耸立起辅助工场、修铸工场的宏伟壮丽的厂房；锻工场的巨大的混凝土基础，也已经全部露出地面。
    建厂的职工们为了提前建好拖拉机厂，开展了劳动竞赛，推广了先进工作法。如施学成小组学习了第一汽车制造厂浇注混凝土柱基的经验，创造了“中凸分层分段浇灌法”，使工效由超额17％提高到超额40％。
