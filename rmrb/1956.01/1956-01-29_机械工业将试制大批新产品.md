Xinhua News Agency, January 27th: China's mechanical industry plans to trial-produce significantly more new product varieties in 1956 than last year.

    This year, state-owned mechanical industry departments plan to trial-produce more than a dozen new products for the transportation industry, including new types of locomotives, freight cars, passenger cars, 4-ton trucks, new passenger and cargo ships, and fishing boats.

    The mechanical industry departments will trial-produce a complete set of 12,000-kilowatt thermal power equipment for the power industry this year. This set of thermal power equipment, composed of a steam turbine, a generator, and a boiler with a steam evaporation capacity of 75 tons per hour, has twice the capacity of the largest thermal power equipment successfully trial-produced last year. This year will also see the trial production of complete sets of 15,000-kilowatt and 12,000-kilowatt hydroelectric power equipment, and so on.

    Among the new products that the mechanical industry departments plan to trial-produce for other industries this year are complete sets of control equipment for automated blast furnaces, sintering machines with greater capacity than last year for sintering iron-rich ore powder, pig iron casting machines, pumping units capable of extracting oil from wells more than 1,000 meters deep, oil drilling rigs with drilling depths of 1,200 meters and 3,200 meters, excavators with a bucket capacity of 3 cubic meters for coal mining or ore excavation, complete sets of sugar-making equipment capable of processing 2,000 tons of sugarcane per day, and various cranes needed for mechanized construction. This year will also see the trial production of dozens of automatic and semi-automatic large machine tools and precision machine tools.

    The mechanical industry departments will also trial-produce tractors, thirty-two-row combined seeders, etc. for agriculture this year.

    机械工业将试制大批新产品
    据新华社27日讯　中国机械工业1956年初步计划试制的各种新产品品种将比去年增加很多。
    今年，国营机械工业部门计划为交通运输业试制的新产品共有十几种，包括新型的机车、货车、客车、载重4吨的载重汽车、新型的客货轮和渔船等。
    机械工业部门今年要为电力工业试制12，000瓩的全套火力发电设备。这套由汽轮机、发电机和每小时蒸汽蒸发量达75吨的锅炉组成的火力发电设备，它的容量比去年试制成功的最大的火力发电设备大一倍。今年还要试制15，000瓩和12，000瓩的全套水力发电设备等。
    机械工业部门今年计划为其他工业试制的新产品中，有自动化高炉的全套控制设备，能力比去年更大的烧结富铁矿粉用的烧结机，铸铁用的铸铁机，能从1，000多公尺深的油井里抽油的抽油机，钻探深度为1，200公尺和3，200公尺的石油钻机，采煤或采掘矿石用的掘斗容量达3立方公尺的挖掘机，每天能处理2，000吨甘蔗的全套制糖设备，机械化施工需要的各种起重机等。今年还要试制几十种自动的、半自动的大型机床和精密机床。
    机械工业部门今年还将为农业试制拖拉机、三十二行联合播种机等。
