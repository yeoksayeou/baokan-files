    "Build the Great Motherland's Dachen Island"
    Wenzhou Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team to Go to the Island to Reclaim Land
    (Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that a youth volunteer reclamation team composed of 200 young people from Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, will depart for Dachen Island on January 29th to reclaim land. Their heroic patriotic act has received strong support from the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League. On the 21st, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League dispatched a special person to Wenzhou, carrying a congratulatory letter from the Central Committee and a large red brocade banner inscribed with "Build the Great Motherland's Dachen Island," ready to be presented to the Wenzhou Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team.
    Dachen Island was liberated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army from the rule of the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on February 13th of last year. The island has fertile land and a mild climate, with two harvests of grain and sweet potatoes per year. Various trees can be planted, and the island is rich in fish products. The surrounding sea is one of the best natural fishing grounds along the Zhejiang coast. In the past, due to the long-term rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the people lived in dire poverty. When the American-Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang retreated, they carried out extensive destruction and abducted all the residents of the island. In the year since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government and with the strong assistance of the People's Liberation Army, agricultural and fishery production and basic construction on the island have been rapidly restored and developed.

    “建设伟大祖国的大陈岛”
    温州青年志愿垦荒队将去岛上开荒
    本报讯　浙江省温州青年200人组成的一支青年志愿垦荒队，将在1月29日出发去大陈岛开荒。他们的这种英勇的爱国行为，得到了青年团中央的大力支持。21日，青年团中央已派专人动身去温州，携带了团中央的祝贺信和题有“建设伟大祖国的大陈岛”一面大红锦旗，准备赠送给温州青年志愿垦荒队。
    大陈岛是中国人民解放军在去年2月13日从美蒋匪帮的统治下解放的。岛上土地肥沃，气候温和，粮食、薯类一年可收两季，可以植造各种林木，并且鱼产丰富，周围海面是浙江沿海最好的天然渔场之一。过去，由于受蒋贼的长期统治，弄得民不聊生，美蒋匪帮溃退时，又大加破坏，并劫走岛上的全部居民。解放后近一年来，在党和人民政府的领导和人民解放军的大力协助下，岛上农、渔业生产及基本建设等各方面，已有了迅速的恢复和发展。
