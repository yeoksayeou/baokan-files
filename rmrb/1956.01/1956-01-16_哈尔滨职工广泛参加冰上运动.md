A total of 104 ice rinks have been prepared by various units in Harbin for their workers, with a total area of 199,497 square meters. Basic-level units in Harbin have organized a total of 43 worker speed skating teams, with 972 workers participating, and 28 figure skating teams, with 424 people participating.

This year, new ice sports have been added for workers. The ice yachting organized by the Municipal Workers' Club has attracted over 140 workers from 8 factories, including Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory, Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and Harbin Tool Factory, to actively participate. The development of ice hockey has also been particularly rapid, with 30 worker ice hockey teams throughout the city.
