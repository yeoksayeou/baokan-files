    Shanghai Suburbs to Implement
    Mechanization and Electrification Plan
    After basically achieving semi-socialist agricultural collectivization, Shanghai's suburbs have begun to implement a plan for agricultural mechanization and electrification. The first batch of ten Czech medium-sized tractors has been shipped to the Shanghai suburbs. Eighty-three young people selected from agricultural production cooperatives have learned to drive tractors and are practicing in the fields. Preparations for the construction of various tractor stations are actively underway. Construction of the city's first "electric irrigation network" has also begun and is expected to be put into production in early June.
    Within three years, all cultivated land in Shanghai's suburbs will be mechanically cultivated and irrigated entirely by electricity and machine pumping. This was planned at the recent rural work conference of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China. According to the plan formulated at this meeting, Shanghai's suburbs will build six electromechanical irrigation networks and three tractor stations within three years. The six electromechanical irrigation networks will be equipped with 266 electric water pumps, 67 diesel water pumps, and 22 artificial rainfall devices. The three tractor stations will be equipped with 216 tractors and many agricultural machines. After this plan is gradually implemented, the suburbs of Shanghai will produce more vegetables, grain, cotton, and non-staple foods for the city.
    Shanghai is the largest industrial city in China, and its suburbs can easily receive assistance from the working class. In particular, Shanghai's existing electricity is entirely capable of supporting suburban agriculture. According to calculations, the electricity required for the entire suburbs to achieve electrical irrigation is less than one-thousandth of the power generation of Shanghai's power industry.

    上海市郊区开始实施
    机械化电气化的规划
    上海市郊区在基本上实现半社会主义的农业合作化以后，开始实施农业机械化、电气化的规划。第一批十台捷克中型拖拉机已经运到上海市郊。从农业生产合作社选拔出来的83名青年已经学会驾驶拖拉机，正在田野上实习。各个拖拉机站的建站筹备工作正在积极进行。市郊第一个“电力灌溉网”的建设工作也开始了，预定在6月初可以投入生产。
    上海郊区的耕地将在三年内全部用机械耕作，并且全部用电气和机器抽水灌溉。这是最近召开的中共上海市委员会农村工作会议上规划的。根据这次会议制定的规划，上海市郊区在三年内将要兴建六个机电灌溉网和三个拖拉机站。六个机电灌溉网将配备266台电力抽水机、67部柴油抽水机和22座人工降雨设备。三个拖拉机站将配备216台拖拉机和许多农业机器。这一规划逐步实行以后，上海市郊就将为城市生产出更多的蔬菜、粮食、棉花和副食品。
    上海是我国最大的工业城市，郊区可以很方便地得到工人阶级的援助。特别是上海市现有的电力完全有可能支援郊区农业。据计算，整个郊区实现电气灌溉所需要的电力还不及上海电力工业发电量的千分之一。
