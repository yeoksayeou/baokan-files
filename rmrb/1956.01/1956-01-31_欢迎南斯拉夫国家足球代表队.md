    Welcome the Yugoslav National Football Team
    Huang Zhong, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sports Commission
    The Yugoslav National Football Team, invited to visit our country, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing today after concluding its visit and matches in Shanghai. We warmly welcome the sports workers and athletes from Yugoslavia who have come from afar.
    Yugoslav sports have greatly developed in the 10 years since the Yugoslav people were liberated. Approximately 800,000 people across the country participate in various sports organizations, and hundreds of thousands of young men and women participate in various sports activities in schools, factories, and the military.
    Yugoslav athletes have achieved brilliant results in various international competitions. Every Yugoslav sports association has received gold and silver Olympic medals, world and European championship titles, and trophies from the largest international competitions.
    Football is the most popular sport in Yugoslavia. Whether in the countryside, schools, factories, or cities, there are tens of thousands of football enthusiasts. There are 1,600 football clubs nationwide, with 70,000 football players. The Yugoslav National Football Team did not lose a single one of the 8 international matches it participated in during 1954 and 1955, with a record of 6 wins and 2 draws. In the past two Olympic Games, the Yugoslav football team won the silver medal twice.
    The Yugoslav National Football Team visiting our country this time is a very strong team with a high level of skill. The athletes of the delegation are all players from famous Yugoslav sports association football teams. Goalkeeper Vladimir Beara and center back Vojadin Boškov are two of the top 10 football players in the country.
    This visit by the Yugoslav National Football Team is a valuable learning opportunity for our sports workers and football players.
    The visit of the Yugoslav National Football Team also brings the friendship of the Yugoslav people and athletes. Through the Yugoslav football players' visit to our country and their matches with our various football teams, the fraternal friendship already established between the Chinese and Yugoslav people will be further developed.

    欢迎南斯拉夫国家足球代表队
    体育运动委员会副秘书长　黄中
    应邀前来我国访问的南斯拉夫国家足球代表队，结束了在上海的访问和比赛以后，定在今天到达北京。我们热烈欢迎远道而来的南斯拉夫的体育工作者和运动员们。
    南斯拉夫的体育运动，在南斯拉夫人民获得解放的10年以来，已经有了很大的发展。全国约有80万人参加了各种体育组织，还有几十万男女青年在学校、工厂和军队里面参加各种各样的体育活动。
    南斯拉夫运动员在参加各种国际性的比赛中，获得了辉煌的成绩。南斯拉夫每个体育协会都得到过金质和银质的奥林匹克奖章、全世界的和欧洲的优胜锦标以及最大的国际比赛的奖杯。
    足球运动是南斯拉夫最普及的一项运动。不论乡村、学校、工厂和城市里，都有成千成万的足球运动爱好者。全国共有1，600个足球俱乐部，拥有7万名足球运动员。南斯拉夫国家足球队在1954和1955两年内参加的8次国际比赛中没有败过一次，成绩是6胜2平。在上两届世界奥林匹克运动会中，南斯拉夫足球队两次获得亚军。
    这次来我国访问的南斯拉夫国家足球代表队是一支实力很强、技术水平很高的球队。代表队的运动员们都是南斯拉夫著名的体育协会足球队的选手。守门员佛拉迪米尔·倍阿拉，中坚伏亚定·鲍什科夫是全国最优秀的10名足球运动员中的两个。
    这次南斯拉夫国家足球代表队的来访，是我国体育工作者和足球运动员们一次珍贵的学习机会。
    南斯拉夫国家足球代表队的来访，同时也带来了南斯拉夫人民和运动员的友谊。通过南斯拉夫足球运动员在我国的访问以及和我国各足球队的比赛，将使中国人民和南斯拉夫人民之间已经建立起来的兄弟般的友谊得到进一步的发展。
