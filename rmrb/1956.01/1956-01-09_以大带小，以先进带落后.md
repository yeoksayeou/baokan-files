Large Leading Small, Advanced Leading Backward
    Cao Baoming, Jin Banghe

    At the end of 1952, there were 19 private shipping companies in Wuhan. In 1953, 12 of them merged into two, bringing the total number of companies in the industry to nine. Among these nine companies, except for Hou Ji, the debts of all the others exceeded their capital. All 114 ships in the industry were old and in disrepair. In 1954, more than 60% of the ships needed immediate repairs; however, the capitalists were unable to afford them. Hou Ji, the company with the best conditions, had two tugboats and one iron barge, all of which needed major repairs in 1954. The repair cost for just one of the ships was more than 60,000 yuan, while the company's total assets were only more than 80,000 yuan. In order to make more money, each company competed to run the more profitable routes. As a result, there were eight ships operating on the Hankou-Jiujiang route, running in shifts, with one ship departing every day, and each ship having to rest for three days after sailing for five days, while many places had goods but no ships to transport them. Moreover, many capitalists adopted the attitude of speculating and profiting during the peak season and waiting for government assistance during the off-season.

    In order to quickly change the chaotic situation of the Wuhan shipping industry and maintain the existing transportation capacity, with the consent of the capitalists, the government decided to implement joint state-private operation of the entire industry in January 1954, and established the preparatory committee for the joint state-private Jingjiang Shipping Company.

    This preparatory committee, on the one hand, carried out the work of asset inventory and valuation, and on the other hand, uniformly allocated and managed the ships of each company, unified the source of goods and freight rates, and initially implemented the planned allocation of "full load and smooth sailing," eliminating the phenomenon of blind operation in the past. The preparatory committee also organized forces to rush to repair ships, successively repairing 252 times, and also built a passenger-cargo ship and a tugboat, maintaining the transportation capacity. The preparatory committee also launched a conservation movement among the workers and promoted advanced Soviet experience. The Jingbo tugboat could only tow more than 400 tons originally. After implementing the one-line towing method, it could tow 800 tons. The Hankou-Yichang liner service was shortened from once every nine days in the past to six to seven days. They reduced freight rates in accordance with state regulations, and the average monthly income still exceeded the highest record during the private operation period. Not only was there no debt, but there was also a slight surplus. This encouraged the morale of the workers and also educated the capitalists. The capitalists, who originally believed that joint state-private operation of the entire Wuhan shipping industry would inevitably lose money, also said at this time: "This broken stall did not lose money but had a surplus, it is really unexpected, it is still the Communist Party's leadership that is effective."

    After the asset inventory and personnel arrangements were completed, the government decided to merge the Jingjiang Shipping Company into the joint state-private Minsheng Shipping Company, implementing the method of large leading small, advanced leading backward. At that time, the capitalists of the Jingjiang Shipping Company were not too worried, while the capitalists of the Minsheng Shipping Company felt that it was "too disadvantageous" and were afraid of being implicated. At this time, the public representative of the Minsheng Shipping Company conducted persuasion and education again, so that the capitalists realized that it was the responsibility of large enterprises to lead small enterprises, and this task was very glorious; at the same time, they saw the transformation of the Minsheng Shipping Company before and after the joint state-private operation, and believed that the Jingjiang Shipping Company would also transform after merging into the Minsheng Shipping Company; and they calculated that the total assets of the Jingjiang Shipping Company were only equivalent to 1% of the existing assets of the Minsheng Shipping Company, and there was no problem for the Minsheng Shipping Company to lead the Jingjiang Shipping Company. Therefore, the capitalists of the Minsheng Shipping Company agreed to the merger. The facts after the merger also proved that the Jingjiang Shipping Company not only did not implicate the Minsheng Shipping Company, but also had a surplus.

    The merger began in September 1954. The Minsheng Shipping Company transferred the three large ships of the original Jingjiang Shipping Company to participate in long-distance transportation, and the rest were handed over to the Hankou Branch of the Minsheng Shipping Company to operate short-distance inland river transportation in Hubei. The Political Department of the Minsheng Shipping Company also sent a group of resident port assistants and representatives to various ports and ships to strengthen political work. Originally, the Wuhan private shipping industry had no welfare facilities at all. After the merger, the Minsheng Shipping Company had a workers' hospital, bathhouse, barbershop, nursery, and other complete welfare facilities, and the workers were very satisfied. After labor insurance registration, the workers enjoyed labor insurance benefits, and their work enthusiasm was even higher. Peng Decheng and other capitalist representatives of the original Jingjiang Shipping Company also served as deputy managers of the Hankou Branch of the Minsheng Shipping Company.

    Over the past year, with the reform of the production system and the exertion of workers' enthusiasm, the business of the Wuhan short-distance shipping industry has undergone significant changes. They opened new routes from Hankou to Maiwangzui to Xiantao to Tianmen, and from Hankou to Changjiangbu to Yingcheng, and reduced freight rates to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. In the past, gypsum produced in Yingcheng County was difficult to transport because the river channel was shallow. Now the Minsheng Shipping Branch uses shallow-water tugboats to transport it, and more than 10,000 tons of gypsum can be transported out every month. The agricultural products of these places can also be transported out in a continuous stream. In the fourth quarter of 1955, they also transported more than 60,000 tons of building materials from Hankou to support the Han River flood diversion project at a low freight rate of 4.2 yuan per ton. They also reduced the freight rate on the Hankou-Jiujiang line by 17%.

    In the past, it took four days for a round trip on the Hankou-Huangshi line, but now it has been shortened to three days. In the past, it took five days for a round trip on the Hankou-Jiujiang line, but now it has also been shortened to three days. In the past, it took six days for a round trip on the Hankou-Yichang line, but now it has been shortened to five days. The workers also actively studied advanced Soviet experience. Shenghua and Shenghan and other ships implemented pushing six barges upstream on the Han River. Shengguang and other ships implemented night航行 on the Han River, increasing transportation efficiency by 40%. Hongshan wheel promoted the advanced Soviet experience of correcting the steam valve, increasing the vehicle speed by five revolutions per minute, shortening the round trip from Hankou to Yichang by five hours. Comparing January to August 1955 with the same period in 1954, the cargo volume of these ships increased by 20%, and the passenger volume increased by 66%.

    Originally, only 45 ships could be used for more than one year after appraisal, and the rest were difficult to use. After more than a year of repair and reconstruction, 66 ships can safely navigate. In 1955, the restored, rebuilt and newly built ships included four tugboats, one passenger-cargo ship and four barges. They also plan to build four new tugboats and rebuild three tugboats in 1956.

    Comparing the situation after the merger with the situation before the merger, the company's total revenue increased by 15.96%, and the cost decreased by 10.52%. In the four months of the merger in 1954, there was a surplus of more than 276,000 yuan.

    Peng Decheng, a capitalist who originally did not want joint state-private operation of the entire industry, originally had more than 80,000 yuan of capital, and received more than 9,000 yuan in dividends in 1954. One of his original ships was also overhauled by the company at a cost of more than 60,000 yuan in 1955. He said with emotion: "If we hadn't merged, I wouldn't have been able to get through the repair of the ship." He took out 70% of the dividends to buy construction bonds, and said that he would work hard to study and transform his thinking in the future.

　　以大带小，以先进带落后
    曹葆铭　金邦和
    1952年年底，武汉市共有19个私营轮船公司。1953年有12家分别联合为两家，全行业总共有九家，在这九家公司中，除厚记一家外，负债都比资本还要多。全行业的114只船舶，都是年久失修的，在1954年有60％以上的船舶必须立即抢修；但是，资本家都无力修理。条件最好的厚记共有两只拖轮一只铁驳，到1954年都得大修，仅其中一只船的修理费就需六万多元，而这家总共才有资产八万多元。为了多赚钱，各家都争着跑赢利较大的航线。结果汉浔线有八只船轮班，一天开一班，每只船航行五天就得休息三天，而许多地方有货却没有船装运。而且，许多资本家都采取了旺季投机谋利，淡季坐等政府帮助的态度。
    为了迅速改变武汉轮船业的紊乱局面，并且维护现有运输能力，在资本家的同意下，政府决定在1954年1月实行全行业公私合营，成立了公私合营荆江轮船公司筹备会。
    这个筹备会一方面进行清产估价工作，另一方面统一调配和管理各家船只，统一货源和运价，初步实行了
  “满载顺开”的有计划调配工作，消除了过去盲目经营的现象。筹备会又组织力量抢修船只，先后修理252次，同时还新建了客货轮和拖轮各一艘，维护了运力。筹备会还发动职工展开节约运动，推行苏联先进经验。静波拖轮原来只能拖四百多吨，实行一列式拖带法以后，能拖运八百吨。汉宜线班轮由过去九天往返一次缩短为六天至七天。他们遵照国家规定降低了运价，每月平均收入仍超过私营时期的最高纪录，不仅没有欠债，还稍有盈余。这就鼓舞了职工情绪，也教育了资本家。原来认为武汉轮船业全行业公私合营必然赔钱的资本家，这时也说：“这个破烂摊子没有赔钱还有盈余，真出意外，还是共产党领导有方。”
    清理资产和人事安排完毕，政府决定把荆江轮船公司并入公私合营民生轮船公司，实行以大带小，以先进带落后的办法。当时，荆江轮船公司的资方顾虑倒不大，而民生轮船公司的资方则认为“太吃亏”，怕受牵累。这时，民生轮船公司公方代表又进行说服教育，使资方认识到带小企业是大企业的责任，这个任务很光荣；同时看到民生轮船公司公私合营前后的转变，相信荆江轮船公司合并到民生轮船公司后也会转变；又计算了荆江轮船公司的全部资产只相当于民生轮船公司现有资产的1％，民生轮船公司带荆江轮船公司毫无问题。于是，民生轮船公司的资本家便同意了合并合营。合并合营后的事实也证明：荆江轮船公司不仅没有牵累民生轮船公司，而且有了盈余。
    合并合营从1954年9月开始。民生轮船公司把原荆江轮船公司的三只大船调去参加长途运输，其余都交民生轮船公司汉口分公司经营湖北内河短途运输。民生轮船公司政治处又派了一批驻港协理员和代表到各港、各船加强政治工作。原来，武汉私营轮船业根本没有什么福利设施，合并合营后，民生轮船公司有职工医院、澡堂、理发室、托儿所等，福利设施齐全，职工们都非常满意。经过劳动保险登记，职工们享受了劳动保险福利，工作热情更加高涨。原荆江轮船公司的资方代表彭得诚等也担任了民生轮船公司汉口分公司的副经理。
    一年多来，经过生产制度的改革，职工工作积极性的发挥，武汉短途航运业的业务有了显著变化。他们开辟了汉口—脉旺嘴—仙桃—天门，汉口—长江埠—应城的新航线，并且降低了运价，促进了城乡物资交流。过去，应城县出产的石膏因为河道浅很难外运。现在民生轮船分公司用浅水拖轮来运输，每月可运出石膏一万多吨。这些地方的农产品也得以源源运出。1955年第四季度，他们又以每吨货4.2元的低运价，从汉口运了六万多吨建筑器材支援汉江分洪工程。他们还把汉浔线的运价降低了17％。
    过去，汉口—黄石线的轮船往返一次需要四天，现在缩短为三天。过去汉口—九江线往返一次需要五天，现在也缩短为三天。过去汉口—宜昌线往返一次需要六天，现在缩短为五天。职工们还积极学习苏联先进经验。生华、生汉等轮在汉水实行顶推六个驳船上驶。生光等轮在汉水实行夜航，提高运输效率40％。洪山轮推行了苏联校正汽门的先进经验，车速每分钟增加五转，往返汉口—宜昌一次缩短五小时。以1955年1至8月同1954年同期比较，这些船只的货运量提高了20％，客运量提高了66％。
    原来，经过鉴定能使用一年以上的船只只有45只，其余都很难使用。经过一年多来的修理改建，有66只能安全航行。1955年恢复、改建和新建的船只有拖轮四只、客货轮一只和驳船四只。他们还计划在1956年新建四只拖轮和改建三只拖轮。
    以合并合营后的情况和合并合营前比较，全公司的收入增加15.96％，成本降低10.52％。1954年合并合营的四个月中，就盈余276，000多元。
    原来不愿全行业公私合营的资本家彭得诚，原有资金八万多元，1954年就分了股息九千多元，他原来的一只轮船在1955年也由公司花了六万多元大修好了。他感动地说：“如果不合营，我大修轮船这关就过不了。”他拿出了70％的股息来买建设公债，并且表示今后要努力学习，改造自己的思想。
