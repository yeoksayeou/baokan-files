Prior to the banquet, he also met with the leaders of the three visiting delegations.

Bao Yindalai, deputy head of the Inner Mongolia Song and Dance Troupe, and Chagangegen, honorary president of the Buddhist Association of China, were invited to attend the banquet.

Also present at the banquet were Vice Premier of the State Council Ulanhu, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Bojun, Secretary-General of the State Council Xi Zhongxun, Director of the Chairman's Office Zhang Jingwu, Deputy Director of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee Xie Fumin and committee members, Deputy Directors of the Ethnic Affairs Commission Wang Feng, Liu Chun, and Sa Kongliao, as well as deputy ministers from various ministries, heads of various religious organizations, and heads of colleges such as the Central Institute for Nationalities, the Huimin College, and the Islamic Classics College.

At the banquet, Chen Yi first, on behalf of the State Council, welcomed the visiting delegations of various ethnic groups from the Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai border regions, the Qinghai pastoral areas, and the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He said: "Your arrival in the capital and various parts of the country coincides with the high tide of our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation. Currently, in the rural areas of our motherland, 500 million farmers warmly welcome and demand agricultural cooperation, and are joyfully taking the socialist road; in major cities across the country, all sectors of capitalist industry and commerce are joining together to implement joint state-private ownership; and various construction projects of socialist industrialization, with the development of heavy industry as the center, are also developing rapidly. It can now be definitely said that our country's first Five-Year Plan will be completed and overfulfilled ahead of schedule, and our country will be built into a socialist society sooner than we originally anticipated. Under this situation, the politics, economy, and culture of the various ethnic minorities in our country will have the possibility of developing faster. Our goal is to enable the various ethnic minorities in our country to transition to socialist society together with the Han people within the next 12 years."

Chen Yi said: "The close unity and brotherly friendship of all ethnic groups is an important guarantee for building a socialist society in our country. In the future, we should continue to implement the Chinese Communist Party's ethnic policies, earnestly respect the freedom of religious belief and customs of minority ethnic groups, strengthen and consolidate the unity between ethnic groups, and mobilize the people of all ethnic groups to strive for our common prosperous and happy socialist future."

Qing Rao, deputy head of the visiting delegation of various ethnic groups from the Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai border regions, Guo Qingzhige, deputy head of the visiting delegation of various ethnic groups from the Qinghai pastoral areas, and Chen Beichen, head of the visiting delegation of various ethnic groups from the northeastern provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, also spoke at the banquet.
