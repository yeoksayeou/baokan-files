Xinhua News Agency, January 12th, Washington dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles held a press conference on January 11th.

　　When talking about the Sino-American talks, Dulles did not indicate in the slightest that the U.S. government was prepared to change its delaying tactics in the talks.

　　Dulles also groundlessly slandered China for "not doing anything that would make the talks beneficial, especially granting Americans in China the right to return home quickly"; however, the fact is that it is the U.S. side that has unreasonably detained Chinese nationals in violation of the Sino-American agreement on the repatriation of civilians.

　　In answering questions from reporters, Dulles stated that the U.S. government was not prepared to stop hydrogen bomb tests.

　　Dulles also mentioned that the Baghdad Pact was "brought about by proposals put forward" by the United States, and that the United States would consider joining the pact.

　　Dulles also mentioned that he hoped to "have the opportunity to visit India" during his trip to Karachi in March to attend the council meeting of the Manila Pact group.

　　At the press conference, Dulles read a statement from the U.S. delegation to the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly to the Secretary of State, which stated that the current historical stage is "an important turning point" in the struggle against "communism." In this "shift in the Cold War," "economic and social issues have come to the forefront." The statement acknowledged that the Soviet Union's measures of economic and social cooperation with Asian countries are producing results, that the "military and political barriers" established by the United States are being "overcome," and that the United States "must fight back" against this. The statement specifically mentioned using "economic and educational activities" to conduct a "counterattack." The statement said, "We are engaged in a competition in the field of economic development in backward countries," and expressed concern that the United States "may be defeated in this economic competition."

    杜勒斯在记者招待会上发表谈话
    新华社12日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯1月11日举行了记者招待会。
    杜勒斯在谈到中美会谈的时候，丝毫没有表示美国政府准备改变它在会谈中采取的拖延态度。
    杜勒斯还毫无根据地诬蔑中国“没有做出会使会谈有益的一些事情，特别是给予在中国的美国人迅速返国的权利”；然而事实是，违反中美关于平民回国问题的协议，无理扣留中国侨民的却正是美方。
    杜勒斯在回答记者问题的时候，表示美国政府不准备停止氢弹试验。
    杜勒斯还谈到，巴格达条约是由于美国“提出的主张而产生的”，美国将会考虑参加这个条约的问题。
    杜勒斯还谈到，他希望在3月间赴喀喇蚩参加马尼拉条约集团理事会会议的旅程中“有机会访问印度”。
    杜勒斯在记者招待会上宣读了出席联合国大会第十届会议的美国代表团给国务卿的一篇声明，声明中认为，目前的历史阶段是同“共产主义”斗争的“一个重要转折点”，在这个“冷战中的一个转变”中，“经济和社会问题已经走到最前列来了”。声明承认，苏联同亚洲国家经济和社会合作的措施正在产生效果，美国建立的“军事和政治的壁垒”在“被越过”，美国对此“必须反击”。声明特别提到要用“经济和教育的活动”来进行“反击”。声明说，“我们正在落后国家的经济发展的领域内进行一种竞争”，声明表示担心，美国“可能在这种经济竞争中败北”。
