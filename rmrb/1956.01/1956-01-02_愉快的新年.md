　　Happy New Year
    Albanian writer Aleksi Çaçi
    Another year has passed. The arrival of each new year always brings outstanding changes to our country. On our path forward, we now measure time not only in "years" but also in "hours," even in "minutes" and "seconds." Like all people who have become masters of their own destiny, the path our country has taken since liberation is glorious. In recent days, each of us has been comparing our present with our past. Along with the emergence of huge construction projects, integrated factories, factories, railways, higher education institutions, and agricultural production cooperatives, there have also emerged new types of people with a high degree of awareness, willing to contribute everything, even their lives, for the happiness and prosperity of the motherland.
    In our country, every New Year always brings new things, and the achievements themselves speak volumes.
    First of all, in the 11 years since liberation, we have built a new industry. Now the land has returned to the tillers. Culture and education have become treasures accessible to everyone. Just a glance at our country and we can see that its face has changed. What used to be where the Stalin Textile Factory stands today? Nothing, just wasteland. The site of the Malik Sugar Refinery in Korçë Prefecture used to be just a stinking pond spreading tropical diseases. Look further afield, in Vlorë, several factories have been built: a cement factory, a rice mill; in a place called Logoshin there is also a cotton ginning factory. In Shkodër, a tobacco factory has been built. Now people are working hard to build the large-scale Hoxha Hydropower Station... All of these are things that our country has never built before. The reason we can now build a new life is precisely because we are no longer who we used to be. We have a saying in our country: "Unity is strength." We are working and creating in this way precisely because we have friends like the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democracies who love us and help us selflessly.
    Last year, I participated in our country's cultural delegation's visit to China. We stayed in that beautiful country for more than a month. We will never forget the days we spent there. We saw with our own eyes how the Chinese people love the Albanian people. Wherever we went, Chinese comrades always spoke enthusiastically about our country and our people. Wherever we went, we could see that China was undergoing tremendous changes. A people who work selflessly and steadfastly like the Chinese people, with strong discipline, a high degree of awareness, and filled with a lofty spirit of internationalism, are bound to make rapid progress. We Albanian people are extremely excited about this, because the stronger our friends are, the faster they build a new life, the stronger we also become, and the more quickly we can make progress on our glorious path forward.
    The old year has passed, and the new year is coming. Let our hands be clasped even tighter. May this year be a better year, may this year bring us more and greater achievements, may this year be a year with hands full of abundance.
    Dear Chinese friends, Chinese comrades, at this New Year's time, from the distant Adriatic coast, I congratulate your country on its increasing prosperity and development, I wish you all good health, and I congratulate the great China on achieving its rightful place in the world.

### 愉快的新年

　　愉快的新年
    阿尔巴尼亚作家　阿列克斯·恰奇
    一年又过去了。每一个新的年份的来临，总给我国带来出色的变化。在我们前进的道路上，我们已不仅以“年”来计算时间，而且以“小时”甚至以“分”、“秒”来计算时间了。如同所有已经当家作主的人民一样，我国自解放以来所走过的道路是光荣的，在最近这些日子里，我们每个人都在把我们的今天和昨天对比一下。同巨大的建设、综合工厂、工厂、铁路、高等学院、农业生产合作社出现的同时，也出现了具有高度的觉悟、为了祖国的幸福和繁荣而愿意贡献出一切，甚至自己的生命的新型的人。
    在我国，每个新年总带来新的事物，事业本身就可以说明一切。
    首先，在解放以后的11个年份中，我们建设了一个新工业。现在土地已回到耕种者手中。文化和教育已是人人都可享受的宝库。只要对我国投射一眼，我们就可以发现，我国的面貌是改变了。今天矗立着斯大林纺织厂的地方，过去有些什么呢？什么也没有，只是一块荒地。科尔察州马立克炼糖厂的所在地，过去只是一个传播湿热病的臭池塘。走远一些看看罢，在发罗拉，已经建立起几座工厂：水泥厂、碾米厂；地名叫做洛果辛的地方也有了一座清棉工厂。在斯库台里，建设了一个烟草工厂。现在人们正在努力建设规模巨大的霍查水力发电站……。所有这些都是我国从未建设过的东西。我们现在所以能够建设新生活，正因为我们已经不是过去的我们了。我国有句俗话：“团结就是力量。”我们正是如此在劳动着、创造着，因为我们有着像苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家那样的爱护我们、无私地帮助我们的朋友。
    去年，我曾参加我国文化代表团访问了中国。我们在那个美丽的国家里逗留了一个多月。我们永远忘不了我们在那里所过的日子。我们亲眼看见中国人民如何热爱阿尔巴尼亚人民。我们不论到什么地方，中国同志们总是热情洋溢地谈到我国和我国人民。我们不论到什么地方，总可以看到中国在起着巨大的变化。像中国人民那样忘我坚定地劳动着，具有坚强纪律和高度觉悟并充满着崇高国际主义精神的人民，是一定会向前突飞猛进的。我们阿尔巴尼亚人民对此感到万分兴奋，因为我们的朋友愈是强大，建设新生活愈快，我们也愈强大，愈能在我们并肩前进的光荣道路上迅速地取得进展。
    旧的一年过去了，新的一年来临了。让我们的手彼此握得更紧一些吧。祝望这一年成为更加美好的一年，祝望这一年给我们带来更多更大的成就，祝望这一年是个双手满盈的一年。
    亲爱的中国朋友们，中国同志们，在这新年的时候，从遥远的亚得里亚海滨，我祝贺你们的国家日益繁荣和发展，祝贺你们大家身体健康，祝贺伟大的中国取得应有的世界地位。
