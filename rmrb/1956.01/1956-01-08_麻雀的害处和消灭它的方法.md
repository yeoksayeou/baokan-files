The sparrow is a common type of bird. It is widely distributed, from central Siberia and the Mongolian People's Republic in the north, to the Malay Peninsula and Java in the south, from Japan in the east to Europe and even the British Isles in the west. Within this range, it can be found almost everywhere there is human activity.

The sparrow belongs to the order Passeriformes. It was originally classified in the family Fringillidae, but recent research by the Soviet ornithologist Sushkin has revealed that it should belong to the family Ploceidae, the same family as the fortune-telling birds used for divination in the past.

Due to the different distribution areas, sparrows have different local subspecies. As far as is known, there are at least six subspecies of sparrows in the world. The sparrows seen in coastal areas and islands of China, as well as in Japan, belong to the same subspecies, which we scientifically call the Russet Sparrow.

The sparrow has short wings and cannot fly long distances, only darting up and down in short bursts. Its feet are nimble, and it is not good at walking on the ground but good at jumping, hence the metaphor of "sparrow leap". It usually lives near people, hiding in the eaves of houses or temples, so some people call it roof sparrow or house sparrow. When grains ripen in the autumn, they fly in flocks to farmland, granaries, and other places, pecking at the grains and causing great losses. According to our feeding experiments, a sparrow weighing about six mace (approximately 22.5 grams) eats about two mace (approximately 7.5 grams) of grain per day, which is more than a quarter of its body weight. Based on this figure, each sparrow consumes about four jin (approximately two kilograms) of grain per year. Sparrows active in the wild fly and jump all day long, so their appetite must be even greater, and the amount of grain they eat and spoil must be even more. Chen Changming of Hunan Agricultural College wrote that in 1954, double-cropping rice was planted in the farmland near Changsha. Because the early rice matured earlier, sparrows concentrated in the rice fields to peck at the grains. According to his investigation and statistics, as much as 35% of the rice ears were damaged. In other words, assuming that one mu (approximately 0.067 hectares) of land can yield 400 jin (approximately 200 kilograms), the sparrows damage 140 jin (approximately 70 kilograms) of grain. During the brooding period, sparrows also eat insects. When we analyzed the food of sparrow chicks in the fruit-producing area of Changli County, Hebei Province, we found wireworms, weevils, and larvae of Lepidoptera in their stomachs. However, considering the situation throughout the year, the harm caused by sparrows far outweighs their benefits to agriculture and forestry.

Sparrows have a strong reproductive capacity. They begin laying eggs between April and May and continue until July and August. A pair of sparrows breeds at least two to three broods a year. In the warmer south, the egg-laying period is even longer, and they may breed five or six broods a year. Each brood lays four to five or even seven to eight eggs. According to this calculation, each pair of sparrows can produce eight, or as many as thirty or forty, little sparrows a year. If a sparrow eats and spoils only three sheng (approximately 3 liters) of grain in a year, then a family of "sparrows" consumes at least two dou (approximately 20 liters) of grain a year, and in many cases, more than one dan (approximately 100 liters). Therefore, everyone must not think that sparrows are small and insignificant; in fact, the harm they cause is quite serious.

There are many ways to eliminate sparrows. Common methods include using wire traps, wire cages, nets, sieves, bamboo mats, or wooden boards to trap them, using slingshots or shotguns to shoot them, using glue to stick them, or using poisoned bait to lure and kill them. Now, let me introduce a few simple and easy-to-implement methods.

Hand-catching method. In warehouses or other grain storage houses, sparrows usually roost on beams or under eaves. At night, we use flashlights to shine on these places. The sparrows are blinded by the light in the dark and cannot see clearly, making them easy to catch. When using this method, it is best to work in pairs, with one person holding the flashlight and the other catching them by hand. If the sparrows live in high places, you can tie a gauze bag-shaped net to a bamboo pole, with the bag opening made of a wire frame with a diameter of about 12 centimeters and a bag depth of about 24 centimeters. As long as you cover the sparrow with the gauze net, it will fall into the net. This method is mostly used in winter because when the weather is cold, sparrows will roost in large numbers on beams or under eaves indoors at night.

Nest destruction method. From a biological point of view, the most basic method to prevent and control sparrows is to destroy their nests during the breeding season between spring and summer, and to take their eggs or chicks, so as to prevent sparrows from breeding, which can greatly reduce the number of sparrows.

Nest box trapping method. Artificial nest boxes are made of old wooden boards about 1.5 centimeters thick (see attached drawing). The inner circumference of the nest box should be 20 to 25 centimeters high, and 10 centimeters deep and wide. The box cover should be tilted forward to prevent rain and snow from leaking in, and the box cover should be attached to the back wall of the box with hinges to prevent it from being blown away by the wind. An opening with a diameter of 3 centimeters should be made at the top of the front wall of the box. A small cover plate that can move up and down should be nailed above the box opening, and a long rope should be tied to the plate. After the nest box is made, use a water glue solution and pigment to paint the nest box to resemble the color of bark, and hang it on the trunk of a tree near a house or chicken farm, 3 to 5 meters above the ground. The box opening is best facing south and should not face the direction of the wind.

Artificial nest boxes are made by taking advantage of the sparrow's habit of building nests. When sparrows breed in the spring, they can use almost any hole to build a nest, so it is easy for them to crawl into the nest box to lay eggs and raise their young. The mother sparrow also lives in the nest box at night. Therefore, at night, as long as you pull the rope of the box opening cover plate, the cover plate closes the box opening, and the mother sparrow, along with the eggs or chicks, will be captured together. If you do not use a cover plate, you can also make a small bag-shaped gauze net and tie it to a long pole. When using it, cover the box opening with the gauze net. When the sparrows in the box are startled and fly out, they will fall into the net, and then take the sparrow eggs or chicks in the nest box for use in trapping other sparrows.

While setting up artificial nest boxes, you can also use mud to block all the natural caves that sparrows may use to build nests, forcing them to concentrate on breeding in the nest boxes.

This method is more troublesome at first, but after the nest box is made, it can be used year after year. The Soviet Union has used this method in its work to eliminate harmful birds. In the spring of 1954, we hung more than 100 nest boxes in the fruit-producing area of Changli County, Hebei Province. As a result, one-third of the nest boxes were entered by sparrows. In 1955, 60% of the nest boxes were occupied by sparrows, and after more than a dozen nest boxes were destroyed, sparrows crawled back into the boxes to build nests again. In the spring of 1955, we also tried this method in orchards and farms near Beijing. As a result, the nest boxes entered by sparrows accounted for more than half of the nest boxes that were hung.

Based on our experience, it is best to start hanging nest boxes in winter, and at the latest before March, so that sparrows can start roosting in the nest boxes during the winter, and it will be easier to attract them to the nest boxes to build nests when the sparrows breed in the spring of the following year.

Eliminating sparrows is a mass work, and it is necessary to mobilize and organize the masses to do it, and to persevere, in order to eliminate sparrows in large numbers and achieve the purpose of eliminating sparrow damage.

　　麻雀的害处和消灭它的方法
    中国科学院动物研究室研究员　郑作新
    麻雀是常见的一种鸟。它分布得很广，北自西伯利亚中部和蒙古人民共和国，南至马来半岛和爪哇，东自日本，西抵欧洲以至英伦三岛。在这个范围以内，凡是有人类活动的地方，几乎每处都可以见到它。
    麻雀属于雀形目。当初把它归于雀科，近来经苏联鸟类学家苏什金的研究，才知道它应隶属于文鸟科，就是和从前卜卦所用的算命鸟同属于一科。
    麻雀因为分布区域的不同，所以有不同的地方性亚种的分化。据现在所知，全世界麻雀至少可分为六个亚种。在我国沿海地带和沿海岛屿以及日本等处所见的麻雀，都属于同一亚种，我们根据科学上的定名，把它叫做琉麻雀。
    麻雀两翅短小，不能远飞，只能在短距离间上下乱窜。它的脚轻捷，在地面上不善于步行，而善于跳跃，所以有“雀跃”的借喻。它平时住的地方靠近人家，匿藏在屋舍或庙宇的瓦檐中间，因此也有人叫它瓦雀、宾雀等。秋季谷物成熟的时候，它们成群结队地飞到农田、粮仓等地方，啄食谷粒，造成很大的损失。据我们饲养试验，一只体重约六钱多的麻雀，每天所吃的谷子约二钱，为它体重的四分之一强。根据这个数字推算，每只麻雀一年中消耗谷物约四斤。在野外活动的麻雀，因为终日飞翔跳跃，食量当更大，被它们吃掉和糟蹋掉的粮食一定更多。湖南农学院陈常铭来信说：1954年，长沙近郊农田改种双季稻，因为早稻成熟较早，麻雀集中稻田啄食，经他调查统计，受害的稻穗竟达35％。也就是说，假设一亩田可收四百斤，麻雀损害的粮食就有140斤。麻雀在育雏期中，也兼吃虫类。我们在河北省昌黎县产果地区做麻雀雏鸟食物分析的时候，在它们的胃中曾经发现金针虫、象鼻虫、鳞翅目幼虫等。但是，从全年的情况来看，麻雀的为害远远超过它对农林的一些益处。
    麻雀的繁殖力强。每年四、五月间开始产卵，到七、八月为止。一对麻雀每年至少繁殖两窝到三窝，在南方温暖的地方产卵期更长，一年可能繁殖五、六窝。每窝产卵四、五个以至七、八个不等。按照这个数字计算，每一对麻雀一年可以产生八个，多至三、四十个小麻雀。一只麻雀在一年内连吃加糟蹋掉的粮食，若仅以三升计算，那么一家“雀口”一年消耗的粮食至少二斗多，多的要达到一担以上。因此，大家决不要以为麻雀形小，无足轻重，其实它的为害是相当严重的。
    消灭麻雀的方法很多。常见的有用铁丝夹、铁丝笼捉，用张网或拉网捕，用筛子、竹篦或木板扣，用弹弓或鸟枪打，用胶粘或用毒饵诱杀等等的方法。现在把简单易行的几种方法介绍一下。
    手捕法。在仓库或其它储粮的屋子里，麻雀一般都在梁间或瓦檐下过夜。晚间我们用手电筒向这些地方照射，麻雀在黑暗中被光闪照，眼睛就看不清，很容易捕捉。用这个方法的时候，最好两个人配合进行，一个人拿手电筒照，另外的人就用手去捉。麻雀若是住在高处，可以在竹竿上拴一个纱布做的袋状网，袋口用铁丝作一圆框，口径约12公分，袋深约24公分，只要把纱布网盖在麻雀身上，麻雀就会落网。这个方法多在冬天使用，因为天气一冷，麻雀晚上更会大量地匿居在屋内梁间或檐下。
    毁巢法。从生物学观点看来，防除麻雀的最基本的方法是要在春夏之间麻雀繁殖的时候，毁掉它们的巢窝，并且掏取它们所产的卵或雏鸟等，不使麻雀繁殖，这样就可以大大减少麻雀的数量。
    巢箱诱歼法。人工巢箱以厚约1.5公分的旧木板制成（见附图）。巢箱内围的大小为高20至25公分，深、宽各10公分。箱盖向前倾斜，以免雨雪漏入，并且用铰链把箱盖装在箱的后壁上，免得被风吹掉。箱的前壁的上方开一个直径为3公分的缺口，箱口上面钉一个能向上下方移动的小盖板，板上系一条长绳。巢箱造好以后，用水胶溶液加上颜料，把巢箱涂染成好像树皮的颜色，挂在房屋或养鸡场附近的树干上，距离地面三到五公尺。箱口最好向南，不宜朝有风的方向。
    人工巢箱是利用麻雀筑窝的习性而制造的。麻雀在春天繁殖的时候，几乎任何窟窿都可以利用来筑窝，因此，它很容易钻到巢箱里产卵育雏。母雀夜晚也住在巢箱里。所以，在夜间只要把箱口盖板的绳子一拉，盖板把箱口关住，母雀连卵或雏鸟就一齐被捕了。如果不用盖板，还可制一个小形的袋状纱布网，绑在长杆子上。用的时候把纱布网盖在箱口，稍动一下，箱子里的麻雀受惊外飞，就会落在网里，而后再掏取巢箱中的雀卵或雀雏，以备再诱歼其它麻雀。
    在设置人工巢箱的同时，还可以用泥堵塞麻雀可能利用筑窝的一切天然洞窟，逼使它们集中到巢箱里繁殖。
    这个方法当初比较费事，但是，巢箱制成以后，年年可以使用。苏联在消灭害鸟的工作中采用过这种办法。1954年春季，我们在河北省昌黎县产果区曾悬挂了一百多个巢箱，结果有三分之一的巢箱被麻雀钻入。1955年有60％的巢箱为麻雀所占，而且有十多个巢箱的雀窝经过破坏以后，麻雀再度钻到箱内筑窝。1955年春天，我们又在北京附近的果园和农场试用过这种方法，结果麻雀迁入的巢箱，占所挂巢箱的半数以上。
    根据我们的经验，悬挂巢箱最好在冬天就开始进行，最迟应在三月前挂上，使得麻雀在越冬的时候就开始在巢箱内宿夜，待来年春天麻雀繁殖的时候，更容易招引它们到巢箱内筑窝。
    消灭麻雀是一个群众性的工作，必须发动和组织群众去做，并且要坚持下去，才能大量地歼灭麻雀，达到消除雀害的目的。
