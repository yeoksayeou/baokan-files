    Editorial:
    To ensure the timely and over-fulfillment of the task of producing 2.36 million double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows to support the flourishing agricultural cooperation movement, 42 agricultural machinery factories across the country launched a factory-wide labor competition in mid-December last year. This year, to accelerate the pace of socialist industrialization and strive to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, 79 factories and mines in the Ministry of Heavy Industry system have decided to launch factory-wide trade competitions for 14 trades and products, based on the competition contracts signed at the end of last year. These include 7 industries such as open-hearth steelmaking, special steel, iron smelting, coking, steel rolling, cement, and glass, and 7 products such as six-six-six, synthetic ammonia, paint, and dyes. Recently, the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant and the Chongqing Machine Tool Plant proposed to launch a factory-wide competition with machine tool plants across the country. The Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Mill and the No. 2 Cotton Textile Mill proposed to launch a competition with textile mills across the country. The Beijing Paper Mill, the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant, and the Beijing Municipal Post Office have also separately proposed to enterprises in their respective industrial systems to launch factory-wide competitions. Some regions have also organized regional trade competitions, such as casting, boiler making, and forging. This form of competition between enterprises in the same industry and between the same trades is a new development in China's labor competition, which will greatly promote production development and accelerate the pace of construction.
    In China's industrial sector, the production levels of various enterprises are uneven, and development is extremely unbalanced. For example, in iron smelting, the iron smelting plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company uses 0.769 cubic meters of blast furnace effective volume to produce one ton of iron, while the Longyan Iron Plant uses 1.178 cubic meters. In open-hearth steelmaking, the No. 1 Plant of Shanghai Iron and Steel Company produces 7.62 tons of steel per square meter of furnace bottom, while Daye Steel Plant produces only 4.8 tons. The scrap rate of castings at the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant is 4% to 5%, while the Dalian Mining Vehicle Plant, not far away, is as high as about 30%. For the same combed yarn, general textile mills use 194-195 kilograms of cotton per piece of yarn, while Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill uses 220 kilograms. This phenomenon is very common. Whether it is output, quality, cost, labor productivity, equipment utilization rate, or other indicators, the levels reached by various similar enterprises vary greatly. Even within an enterprise, the levels reached by classes, groups, and individuals using the same equipment and doing the same work often differ. This difference is where the potential lies in industrial production and construction! If we work hard to raise the backward parts to the advanced level, we can greatly accelerate the pace of socialist industrialization. Therefore, helping the backward parts to reach the advanced level is a regular and serious task of party organizations at all levels, various industrial departments, and various enterprises.
    Organizing factory-wide competitions in the same industry and competitions between the same trades is one of the most effective ways to achieve this task. Organizing enterprises with the same production nature, similar products, similar equipment, and similar technological processes to compete together can quickly find various advanced experiences through mutual comparison; and these advanced experiences can be commonly learned and universally promoted. In the factory-wide competition among the three bicycle factories in Shenyang, Tianjin, and Shanghai, the bicycles produced by each factory were exhibited, and technical appraisals were conducted jointly. On-site visits were organized, and special experience exchange meetings were held. The Shanghai factory found that the Tianjin and Shenyang factories had more than 60 experiences to learn from, and the Tianjin factory also found that the Shenyang factory had 34 experiences to learn from. In the factory-wide competition, the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Plant also found that the general assembly team of the Hunan Agricultural Machinery Plant was more efficient than its own and decided to learn from their experience. In this way, constantly discovering and exchanging advanced experiences among various enterprises in the same industry can continuously enrich advanced experiences and gradually summarize systematic advanced experiences from management to technology, including various departments and trades, in the entire industry. As everyone knows, systematically and comprehensively promoting advanced experiences is the most effective way to complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule and accelerate the pace of industrialization. Organizing factory-wide competitions in the same industry and competitions between the same trades can closely combine the promotion of advanced experiences with labor competitions, making the promotion of advanced experiences an extremely broad mass movement.
    Launching factory-wide competitions in the same industry and competitions between the same trades, and exchanging experiences with each other, can effectively organize the advanced to lead the backward, and urge and help the backward to catch up with the advanced. Advanced enterprises often have backward links, and so-called backward enterprises often have good experiences in some aspects. Organizing competitions facilitates enterprises to learn from each other's strengths and make up for their weaknesses. Advanced enterprises can also learn a lot from other enterprises to make themselves more progressive. The result of such competitions will inevitably lead to a comprehensive improvement in the production of the entire industry. As everyone knows, backward enterprises learn from advanced enterprises, catch up with advanced enterprises, and advanced enterprises help backward enterprises catch up with themselves, while striving to make themselves more progressive. This is the basic principle of our labor competition. And organizing factory-wide competitions in the same industry and competitions between the same trades is the most effective way to implement this principle.
    Factory-wide competitions in the same industry and competitions between the same trades also help to carry out competitions within factories and maintain the widespread mass character and sustainability of competitions. In the past, the factory-wide competitions we organized were mostly regional, organizing factories and mines in various different industries in the same region to compete together. This form played a certain role in mobilizing the masses to ensure the completion of the national plan. However, due to the different production natures of various enterprises, it is often difficult to formulate competition conditions and evaluate competition results; especially, the summary and exchange of advanced experiences are greatly restricted, so that sometimes the competition becomes a formality. Organizing factory-wide competitions and trade competitions by industry system makes it easier to formulate common and clear goals and specific competition conditions. When evaluating competition results, it is easier to evaluate them more reasonably and accurately, and to find advanced experiences from them, truly reflecting the principle of advanced leading backward competition. Organizing such competitions can widely adopt various methods such as professional conferences, advanced producer tour performances, on-site observations, product evaluations, and advanced technology training courses to summarize and disseminate advanced experiences, making the content of labor competitions richer. Adopting this form can also mobilize all personnel in the enterprise to participate in the competition. Leaders of various enterprises can learn from each other's experience in organizing production, staff in various departments can learn from each other's experience in departmental work, and workers in various trades can learn from each other's various technical operation experiences. Everyone can get help, supervision, and improvement in the competition, and therefore will be very interested in the competition. This is the basis for the widespread mass character and sustained development of labor competition.
    The national committees of various industrial trade unions are organizing or preparing to organize industry-wide factory-wide competitions and trade competitions. In order to accelerate the pace of socialist industrialization, the grassroots organizations of trade unions in factories and mines in various regions should go all out to mobilize all employees and make this competition develop rapidly and fully. Party organizations at all levels should attach great importance to this new development of labor competition, support this competition, strengthen the leadership of the competition, and mobilize all party members, Communist Youth League members, and trade union members in the enterprise to actively participate in the competition activities. Administrative leaders of various industrial ministries, bureaus, and enterprises should also actively participate in the leadership of this competition and promptly solve all problems that require administrative solutions in the competition. All management personnel, technical personnel, and workers should be actively mobilized to enthusiastically participate in the ranks of this competition, and gather everyone's enthusiasm for building socialism into a huge force to strive for the comprehensive early completion and over-fulfillment of the Five-Year Plan!

    开展同产业的厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛
    去年12月中旬，全国42个农具厂，为了保证如期完成和超额完成236万部双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁的任务，支援蓬勃发展的农业合作化运动，展开了厂际劳动竞赛。今年，为了加快社会主义工业化的速度，争取提早完成第一个五年计划，重工业部系统79个厂矿根据去年年底签订的竞赛合同，决定开展14个工种和产品的厂际同工种竞赛，其中包括平炉炼钢、特殊钢、炼铁、炼焦、轧钢、水泥、玻璃等7个产业，和六六六、合成氨、油漆、染料等7种产品。最近，北京第一机床厂和重庆机床厂又提出创议，同全国的机床厂展开厂际竞赛。北京第一棉纺织厂和第二棉纺织厂提出同全国的纺织厂展开竞赛。北京造纸厂、北京石景山发电厂、北京市邮局也都分别向本产业系统的各企业提出了开展厂际竞赛的建议。有些地区还组织了地区性的同工种竞赛，如翻砂、锅炉、锻压等等。这种同产业的企业间和同工种间的竞赛形式，是我国劳动竞赛的一个新发展，这对于发展生产、加快建设速度将发生巨大的推动作用。
    在我国的工业部门中，各个企业的生产水平参差不齐，发展极不平衡。例如炼铁，本溪钢铁公司炼铁厂每出一吨铁要占高炉有效容积0.769立方公尺，而龙烟铁厂却要1.178立方公尺。平炉炼钢，上海钢铁公司第一厂每1平方公尺炉底出钢7.62吨，而大冶钢厂只出4.8吨。大连机车车辆制造厂铸件的报废率是4％到5％，而相隔不远的大连工矿车辆厂却高达30％左右。同样的精梳纱，一般纺织厂每件纱用194—195公斤棉花，而上海国棉二厂却要用220公斤。这种现象是很普遍的。无论是产量、质量、成本、劳动生产率、设备利用率等各种指标，各个同样的企业所达到的水平，都有很大的差别。即使在企业内部，利用同样设备、做同样工作的班、组、个人，他们所达到的水平也往往不一样。这种差别，就是工业生产和建设中的潜力所在！如果我们努力把落后的部分提高到先进的水平，就可以大大加快社会主义工业化的速度。因此，帮助落后的部分提高到先进的水平，是各级党组织、各个工业部门和各个企业经常的严重的任务。
    组织同产业的厂际竞赛和同工种间的竞赛，是实现这一任务的最有效的方法之一。把生产性质相同、产品相近、设备相仿、工艺过程相似的企业组织在一起竞赛，就可以从相互比较中，迅速找到各种各样的先进经验；而这些先进经验都是可以共同学习、普遍推广的。沈阳、天津、上海3个自行车厂在厂际竞赛中，把各个厂生产的自行车都展览出来，共同做技术鉴定，又组织现场参观，召开专门的经验交流会。上海厂就发现天津厂和沈阳厂有60多项经验可以学习，天津厂也发现沈阳厂有34项经验可以学习。北京农业机械厂在厂际竞赛当中，也发现湖南农业机械厂的总装配小组效率比自己高，决定学习他们的经验。这样，在同一行业的各个企业中间，不断地发现和交流先进经验，就可以使先进经验不断丰富，日趋完整，在整个行业中逐渐总结出从管理到技术、包括各部门、各工种的系统的先进经验来。大家知道，系统地、全面地推广先进经验，是提早完成第一个五年计划、加快工业化速度的最有效的方法。组织同产业的厂际竞赛和同工种的竞赛，就可以把推广先进经验和劳动竞赛紧密地结合起来，使推广先进经验成为一个极其广泛的群众运动。
    展开同产业的厂际竞赛和同工种的竞赛，互相交流经验，就可以有效地组织先进的带动落后的，督促和帮助落后的赶上先进的。而先进的企业常常也有落后的环节，所谓落后的企业也常常在某些方面有好的经验。组织竞赛，就便于各个企业取长补短，先进的企业也可以从别的企业学到很多东西，使自己更加进步。这样竞赛的结果，就必将使全行业的生产得到全面的提高。大家知道，落后企业向先进企业学习，赶上先进企业，先进企业帮助落后企业赶上自己，同时力求自己更加进步，这是我们劳动竞赛的基本原则。而组织同产业的厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛，正是贯彻这一原则的最有效的方法。
    同产业的厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛，还有助于厂内竞赛的开展，保持竞赛的广泛的群众性和持久性。过去我们组织的厂际竞赛，多半是地区性的，把同一地区的各种不同产业的厂矿组织在一起竞赛。这种形式对发动群众保证完成国家计划，曾起了一定的作用。但是，由于各个企业的生产性质不同，制定竞赛条件和评比竞赛结果往往遇到困难；特别是总结和交流先进经验，更受到很大的限制，以致有些时候使竞赛流于形式。而按产业系统组织厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛，就容易制定共同的明确的奋斗目标和具体的竞赛条件。在评比竞赛结果的时候，就容易评得比较合理、准确，并从中发现先进的经验，真正体现先进带动落后的竞赛原则。组织这样的竞赛，可以广泛地采用专业会议、先进生产者巡回表演、现场观摩、产品评比、先进技术训练班等多种多样的方法，来总结和传播先进经验，使劳动竞赛的内容更加丰富。采用这种形式，还可以动员企业中的全体人员参加竞赛。各个企业的领导人员可以相互学习组织生产的经验，各个科室的工作人员可以相互学习科室工作的经验，各个工种的工人可以相互学习各种技术操作经验，大家都可以在竞赛中得到帮助、督促和提高，因而都会对竞赛发生浓厚的兴趣，这就是劳动竞赛的广泛的群众性和持久开展的基础。
    现在各个产业工会的全国委员会正在组织或准备组织全产业的厂际竞赛和同工种竞赛。为了加速社会主义工业化的速度，各个地区厂矿企业工会的基层组织，应该全力以赴，发动全体职工，使这个竞赛迅速地饱满地开展起来。各级党组织应该十分重视劳动竞赛的这个新发展，支持这个竞赛，加强对竞赛的领导，发动企业中的全体党员和青年团员、工会会员积极参加竞赛的活动。各个工业部、管理局和各个企业的行政领导人员，也要积极参加对这个竞赛的领导，及时解决竞赛中要求行政方面解决的一切问题。全体管理人员、技术人员和工人，要积极动员起来，热情地参加到这个竞赛的行列中来，把每个人建设社会主义的热情，汇集成一支巨大的力量，为全面地提早和超额完成五年计划而奋斗！
