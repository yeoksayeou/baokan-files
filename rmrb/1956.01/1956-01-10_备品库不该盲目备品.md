Title: The Spare Parts Depot Should Not Blindly Stock Up

The phenomenon of blindly stocking up spare parts at the Taiyuan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory's spare parts depot is very serious. For example, since 1956, the overhaul task for the Л51-type locomotives has been very small, but the depot is storing a large number of spare parts. Take the return lead screw, for instance; only two have been used in the past three years. In August 1955, the depot still had one in stock, but they ordered ten more from an outside factory. It is estimated that these ten return lead screws will be enough to last until the end of the Third Five-Year Plan. As for the first and third connecting rods of the Л51-type locomotive, only two were replaced from January to September 1955, but disregarding the fact that there were still 19 in stock, they ordered 36 more from an outside factory. Based on the current actual replacement rate, these 55 connecting rods would be sufficient for more than 20 years of use.

In order to stock up more spare parts, this factory also commissioned outside factories to process parts at high prices, resulting in large cost overruns. The price of the rocker arm commissioned to an outside factory in April was four times higher than the self-made one.

As a result of blindly processing parts just to complete the storage figures, this spare parts depot, which was originally intended to supply production in a timely manner and meet the needs of the workshops, has long become a concentration camp for stagnant spare parts.

    备品库不该盲目备品
    太原机车车辆修理工厂备品库盲目备品的现象很严重。例如自1956年以后，攵ㄌ51型机车检修任务是很小的，可是库内却储藏着大量的配件。就像回动丝杆，近三年来只用过两根，1955年8月份库里还存有一根，可是又向外厂订制了十根。据估计，这十根回动丝杆，足足可以用到第三个五年计划终了。ㄥㄌ51型机车第一、三位连杆，1955年1月至9月份，只更换过两根，他们也不顾库存还有19根的情况，又向外厂订制了36根。按照目前实际修换率，这55根连杆，就足够20多年使用。
    这个工厂为了多备些备品，还高价委托外厂加工配件，造成大量超支。4月份委托外厂加工的摇连杆，价格就超过自制的四倍。
    只顾完成储备数字，盲目加工配件的结果，这个原为及时供应生产，满足车间需要的备品库，长期以来却成为呆滞配件的集中地了。
