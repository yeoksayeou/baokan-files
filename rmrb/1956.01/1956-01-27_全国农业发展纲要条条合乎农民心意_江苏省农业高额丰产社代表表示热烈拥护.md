The more than 2,400 representatives attending the Jiangsu Province High-Yield Agricultural Cooperative Representatives Conference discussed the National Agricultural Development Program in groups on the 26th. Every representative was greatly encouraged.

	Chen Yongkang, a national model of high rice yield and director of the Lianmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Songjiang County, said: "Chairman Mao has thought of everything for us. The National Agricultural Development Program meets our wishes in every respect." He said that in order to increase grain production, their cooperative plans to plant more than 5,000 mu of double-cropping rice this year, striving for an average yield of 1,100 jin per mu. Last year, the Xinghong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Qidong County produced an average of 106 jin of ginned cotton per mu, with the highest yield being 156 jin. Chen Weiyuan, the director of this cooperative, said: "The National Agricultural Development Program has further broadened our horizons. Our 1956 cotton production target was originally set at an average of 113 jin of ginned cotton per mu, but by further utilizing the superiority of being organized, it can be increased to 130 jin." Xu Fangbao, a female cooperative member with 15 years of silkworm rearing experience, said: This year, we must strive for an average cocoon yield of 100 jin per silkworm egg sheet.

	More than 50 agricultural experts, including Jin Shanbao, the president of Nanjing Agricultural College, and researchers from the East China Agricultural Science Institute, who attended the conference, also enthusiastically helped the high-yield experts summarize their high-yield experience in order to carry out the "1,000 jin of grain" and "100 jin of cotton" high-yield campaign.

    全国农业发展纲要条条合乎农民心意
    江苏省农业高额丰产社代表表示热烈拥护
    正在参加江苏省高额丰产社代表会议的2，400多个代表，26日分组讨论了全国农业发展纲要，每一个代表都受到很大鼓舞。
    全国水稻丰产模范、松江县联民农业生产合作社主任陈永康说：“毛主席什么都为我们想到了。全国农业发展纲要条条合乎我们的心意。”他说，他们社里为了增产粮食，今年计划种5，000多亩双季稻，争取每亩平均产量达到1，100斤。启东县星宏农业生产合作社去年平均每亩棉田产皮棉106斤，最高产156斤。这个社的社长陈维元说：“全国农业发展纲要又扩大了我们的眼界。我们1956年棉花产量指标原定为平均每亩产皮棉113斤，进一步发挥组织起来的优越性，可以提高到130斤。”有15年养蚕经验的养蚕能手女社员许芳宝表示：今年要争取每张蚕种平均产茧100斤。
    参加大会的南京农学院院长金善宝、华东农业科学研究所的研究员等50多位农业专家，也热情地帮助丰产能手们总结高额丰产经验，以开展“千斤粮”“百斤棉”的高额丰产运动。    （据新华社讯）
