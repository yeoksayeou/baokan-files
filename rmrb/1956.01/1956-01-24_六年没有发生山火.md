No Forest Fires for Six Years

Forest fires are a dangerous enemy of forests. In mountainous areas, a fire often destroys millions of mu of forests and the property of the masses in an instant. However, as long as we strengthen the organization and leadership of forest fire prevention and frequently educate the masses about forest fire prevention, forest fires can be completely prevented.

This is what Gaozhuang Township in Xinhua County, Hunan Province, has done. Under the leadership of the Party branch, this township established a forest fire prevention committee very early on, headed by the township head and including militia captains and security committee members. Under the committee, forest fire prevention groups were also established. Each group has a fire-fighting team organized by young and middle-aged people, responsible for different villages to ensure the prevention of forest fires. The township also stipulated a forest fire prevention agreement: cattle and sheep are not allowed on mountains where trees have been planted; firebreaks must be made when burning ash; each family must educate their children not to play with fire in the mountains and forests, and if children cause a fire, the parents should be responsible. In order to prevent wildfires from other places from spreading, Gaozhuang Township also signed a joint prevention agreement with the neighboring Xiawen Township. Every season when forest fires are likely to occur, the township's forest fire prevention committee conducts publicity and education on forest fire prevention to the masses.

As a result, this township has not had a forest fire for six years.

    六年没有发生山火
    山火是森林的危险的敌人，在山林地区，一场火灾往往会一下子把千百万亩的山林和群众的房屋财产毁灭掉。但是，只要加强护林防火的组织领导，经常教育群众护林防火，山火是完全可以防止的。
    湖南省新化县高庄乡就是这样做的。这个乡在党支部的领导下很早就成立了以乡长为主任、吸收民兵队长和治安委员等参加的护林防火委员会，在委员会的下面，还成立了护林防火小组，每组都有青壮年组织的打火队，分村包干负责，保证防止山林火灾。这个乡还规定了护林防火公约：栽了树的山不准放牛羊；烧灰一定要断火路；各家都要教育自己的孩子不在山林里玩火，如果孩子失火烧山，家长应当负责。为了预防外地的野火延烧过来，高庄乡还同毗邻的下温乡订立了联防公约。每到容易发生山火的季节，乡护林防火委员会就向群众进行护林防火的宣传教育。
    这样做的结果：这个乡已经六年没有发生山火。
