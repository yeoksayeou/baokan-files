"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
Introduction to the Contents of the 1955 Chinese Edition, Issue 51

The organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1955, Issue 51, has been published.

To celebrate the 76th birthday of Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's cause, this issue published an editorial entitled "The Invincible Doctrine of Marx-Engels-Lenin and Stalin." The editorial stated that the doctrine of Marx-Engels-Lenin and Stalin is great and full of vitality, pointing out the path for the working people to carry out the revolutionary transformation of society and establish communism. The entire course of history has vividly proven the correctness of Marxism-Leninism. The great vitality of the Marxist-Leninist doctrine and its victory have not only been fully proven by the experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism, but also by many epoch-making major events. These events are: the formation and consolidation of the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the growing combat strength of the working class in capitalist countries, and the gradual collapse of the imperialist colonial system under the powerful blows of the national liberation movement. The editorial emphasized that the growth of democratic and socialist forces is the hallmark of our era. The great ideas of Marxism-Leninism illuminate the path of peace, freedom, and progress for all mankind; they are achieving victory and will continue to achieve victory.

This issue contains Pospelov's report at the meeting commemorating the 50th anniversary of the First Russian Revolution held in Moscow on December 20, 1955: "The Armed Uprising of December 1905—the Climax of the First Russian Revolution."

Important articles in this issue include: "The Japanese Communist Party Struggles for the Interests of the Japanese People" by Shiga Yoshio, member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, and "The German Democratic Republic Struggles to Increase Labor Productivity" by Professor Behrens, Director of the Central Bureau of Statistics of the State Planning Commission of the German Democratic Republic, and others.

Shiga Yoshio's article briefly describes the Japanese Communist Party's struggle for the interests of the Japanese people since its establishment, and analyzes the current situation of the Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, and democracy. The article points out that the Japanese Communist Party has been using the theory of Marxism-Leninism as a guide since its establishment 33 years ago, and it is now able to grasp the correct political line, the correct organizational line, and the correct daily work line. As long as the entire party unites closely and strives to work together in a truly concerted effort, the party will surely win the trust of the people, unite them in the national liberation democratic united front, and transform Japan into an independent, peace-loving, and democratic country.

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
　　1955年中文版第51期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”1955年第51期中文版已经出版。
    为庆祝列宁事业的伟大继承者斯大林诞生76周年，这一期发表了题为“战无不胜的马克思—恩格斯—列宁和斯大林的学说”的社论。社论说，马克思—恩格斯—列宁和斯大林的学说是伟大而生气勃勃的，它为劳动人民指出了进行社会的革命改造和建立共产主义的道路。历史的全部进程已经生动地证明了马克思列宁主义的正确性。马克思列宁主义学说的伟大的生命力和这个学说的胜利不仅已经被苏联建成社会主义的经验所充分证明，而且也被许多划时代的重大事件所充分证明。这些事件就是：以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的强大的社会主义阵营的形成和巩固，资本主义各国工人阶级的战斗力量的日益发展，在民族解放运动有力的打击之下帝国主义殖民制度的日趋崩溃。社论强调说，民主和社会主义力量的增长是我们这一时代的标志。马克思列宁主义的伟大思想为全人类照亮了和平、自由和进步的道路，它们正在取得胜利，而且要继续取得胜利。
    这一期刊载了波斯伯洛夫1955年12月20日在莫斯科举行的第一次俄国革命50周年纪念大会上的报告：“1905年12月武装起义——第一次俄国革命的高峰”。
    这一期刊载的重要文章有：日本共产党中央委员会常任干部会委员志贺义雄的“日本共产党为日本人民的利益而奋斗”和德意志民主共和国国家计划委员会中央统计局局长贝伦斯教授的“德意志民主共和国为提高劳动生产率而斗争”等。
    志贺义雄的文章简述了日本共产党自从成立以来为日本人民的利益而奋斗的经过，并且分析了当前日本人民争取和平、独立和民主的斗争情况。文章指出，日本共产党建党33年以来一直以马克思列宁主义的理论作为指针，它现在已经能够掌握正确的政治方针、正确的组织方针和正确的日常工作的方针。只要全党紧密团结，真正协同一致地努力奋斗，党就一定会赢得人民的信任，把他们团结在民族解放民主统一战线中，把日本变成独立的、爱好和平的民主国家。
