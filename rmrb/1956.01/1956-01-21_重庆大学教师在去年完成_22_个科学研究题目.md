    Chongqing University Teachers Completed 22 Scientific Research Projects Last Year
    Last year, teachers at Chongqing University completed 22 scientific research projects.
    The research topic "Stratigraphic Division, Zonation and Correlation of Devonian Strata (approximately 300 million years ago) in the Longmen Mountains of Sichuan" completed by Le Senxun, an old professor in the Department of Geology, is of great value for determining the horizon of certain important mineral occurrences in this region. The design of the "Small Current Grounding Indicator" completed by Wu Jianguo, a lecturer in the Department of Electrical Engineering, has been installed in the Chongqing Daxi Gou Power Plant, and the test results are good. This indicator can quickly and accurately indicate the location of the fault when a certain line in the power grid is grounded, so as to facilitate repairs. The "Metal Heat Exchanger" researched and designed by Lin Yanxian, an associate professor in the Department of Metallurgy, can reduce fuel consumption in metallurgy, improve heating quality, and increase furnace production efficiency. Lin Yanxian gave a detailed description of the structure, installation, operation, and equipment maintenance of the "Metal Heat Exchanger."

    重庆大学教师在去年完成22个科学研究题目
    重庆大学教师去年完成了22个科学研究题目。
    地质系老教授乐森璕研究完成的“四川龙门山区泥盆纪（大约在三万万年以前）地层分层分带及其对比”题目，对确定这个地区的某些重要矿产发生的层位等方面很有价值。电机系讲师吴健国完成的“小电流接地指示器”的设计，已经在重庆大溪沟发电厂安装，试验效果良好。这个指示器可以把电力网中某一线接地时发生的故障地点迅速、准确地指示出来，以便进行修理。冶金系副教授林衍先研究设计的“金属热交换器”，可以减少在冶金方面的燃料消耗、提高加热质量和炉子的生产效率。林衍先对“金属热交换器”的构造、安装、操作、设备维护都作了详细的叙述。
