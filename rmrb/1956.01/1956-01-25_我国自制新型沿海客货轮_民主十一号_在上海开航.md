    China's Self-Made New Type of Coastal Passenger and Cargo Ship
    "Democracy No. 11" Opens in Shanghai
    China's second new type of coastal passenger and cargo ship designed and manufactured by China itself, "Democracy No. 11," set sail in Shanghai on the 22nd.
    When designing and manufacturing this ship, the state-owned Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet shipbuilding industry. The bottom of the ship has a double-layer structure, which is strong and durable, and can sail as usual even in areas where the ocean freezes with thin ice in winter. This ship also adopts a compartment design method, so that even if one compartment takes on water due to an accident, the other compartments will not follow suit. The cabins of all classes on this ship have heating and ventilation equipment. Each passenger has a fixed berth. Mothers with infants can also live in specially designated mother-infant rooms. The ship also has many books, entertainment supplies, and sufficient life-saving and fire-fighting equipment. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    我国自制新型沿海客货轮
    “民主十一号”在上海开航
    中国自己设计和制造的第二艘新型沿海客货轮“民主十一号”，22日在上海开航。
    国营上海江南造船厂在设计和制造这艘轮船的时候，学习了苏联造船工业的先进经验。轮船的舱底是双层的，结实牢固，在冬季海洋结上薄冰的地区，也能照常航行。这艘轮船并且采用了分舱设计的方法，即使某一舱因故进水，其他各舱也不会跟着进水。这艘轮船的各级客舱都有暖气、通风设备。每个旅客都有一个固定的床位。带着婴孩的母亲，还可以住在特辟的母子室里。船上还备有很多图书、娱乐用品以及足够的救生和消防器具。    （据新华社讯）
