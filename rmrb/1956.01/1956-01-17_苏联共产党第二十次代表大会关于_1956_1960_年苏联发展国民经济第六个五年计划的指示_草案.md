Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: Draft "Directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union, 1956-1960"
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union today published the draft "Directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union, 1956-1960."
    The draft directives state that the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union points out that the tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union, as stipulated by the 19th Party Congress, have been victoriously completed.
    In the past 5 years, Soviet industrial output has increased by 85%, of which the production of means of production has increased by 91%, and the total output of the machinery manufacturing and metal processing industries in 1955 has increased to 2.2 times that of 1950. The industrial output in 1955 was 3.2 times that of 1940. The five-year plan tasks for the production of the most important products of heavy industry have been overfulfilled. These products are: steel, steel products, coal, oil, electricity, cement, aluminum, automobiles, tractors, and many other products.
    The Party and the government, through the adoption of major measures to increase grain and livestock products, have created conditions for the rapid upsurge of socialist agriculture. Due to the reclamation of wasteland, the sown area of ​​grain in 1955 increased by nearly 24 million hectares compared with 1950. The total harvest of major crops and the production of livestock products have increased.
    Due to the victorious development of heavy industry and the growth of agricultural output, the production of consumer goods has increased by 76% in 5 years, that is, more than doubled the pre-war level.
    The five-year plan tasks in transportation have been overfulfilled. On the basis of continuous improvement of technology, improvement of production organization, and development of socialist competition, labor productivity in industry, agriculture, and transportation has been improved.
    In the years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the national income of the Soviet Union increased by 68%, the actual wages of workers and staff increased by 39%, and the actual income of collective farm members increased by 50%. The five-year plan tasks in retail trade have been overfulfilled. Soviet science and culture have been victoriously developed.
    At the same time, there are also serious shortcomings in individual sectors of economic life.
    Due to the completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the country's economic strength has grown, the socialist economic system has been further consolidated, the material and cultural level of the Soviet people has been improved, the economic ties between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries have been expanded, and the international position of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp has been strengthened.
    The Soviet Union now has a powerful and comprehensively developed socialist production, and has far more material resources and skilled cadres than ever before.
    The level reached by the development of social production makes it possible for the Soviet state not only to rapidly develop the production of means of production, which has been and is still the unshakable foundation of the entire national economy, but also to rapidly develop the production of consumer goods and greatly increase social wealth, thereby taking a step further on the road of building a communist society in our country.
    The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union believes that the Soviet Union now has all the necessary conditions to solve the fundamental economic task of the Soviet Union on the road of peaceful economic competition in the shortest historical period, that is, to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of product production per capita.

    The draft directives believe that the most important task in the machine manufacturing industry is to further master and widely develop the production of new production equipment and machines with high production efficiency.
    The draft directives then put forward tasks in the machine manufacturing industry, the machine tool manufacturing industry, in the production of agricultural machinery, construction machinery and road construction machinery, in the shipbuilding industry, and in the building materials, timber, paper, and wood processing industries.
    In terms of light industry, it is stipulated to further increase the production of consumer industrial products, and greatly improve the quality, variety, and external appearance of industrial products.
    According to the increasing source of agricultural raw materials, it is stipulated to further increase the production of food.
    The second part of the draft directives talks about the mechanization and automation of production processes in various industrial sectors.
    In order to ensure the further development of technology, improve labor productivity, and improve labor conditions, it is stipulated to vigorously increase the speed of work mechanization and promote the automation of production processes on a large scale in industry.

    Transition from the automation of individual linkages and processes to the automation of entire workshops and complete sets of technological procedures, and establish fully automated factories.
    The third part of the draft directives talks about the tasks of specialization and collaboration in industry.
    In order to accelerate the improvement of social labor productivity, reduce production costs, and improve product quality, the draft stipulates that the expansion of specialization and collaboration in industry should be ensured in the Sixth Five-Year Plan, and large-scale continuous production should be organized in specialized enterprises. Ensure that specialized enterprises produce standard, compliant, and standardized parts, components, and products in accordance with the latest technological procedures. Rationally allocate the production of industrial sectors, factories, as well as parts, components, and products to various departments and individual enterprises. Establish specialized enterprises in various economic regions of the country, and pay attention to realizing the collaboration of enterprises within the economic regions and large industrial centers.
    The fourth part of the draft is about agricultural issues. The directives stipulate that agriculture and animal husbandry will have a rapid increase. According to the plan, the total output of grain in 1960 will reach 180 million tons (11 billion poods), and the output of industrial raw material crops, potatoes, vegetables, and livestock products will increase in the following scale in 5 years (percentage of 1960 output to 1955 output): cotton—156, flax—135, beet—154, potatoes—185, vegetables—218, meat—200, milk—195, eggs—254, wool—182.
    In order to further improve grain production, sowing will be carried out on at least 30 million hectares of already reclaimed virgin and fallow land in 1956, and the reclamation of virgin and fallow land will continue. The yield per unit area of ​​grain will be greatly improved, and in recent years, high-yielding and high-quality superior varieties of grain suitable for sowing in various regions will be sown throughout the country.
    The cultivation of corn with the highest yield per unit area will be developed, and the sown area of ​​corn in collective farms and state farms will increase to at least 28 million hectares by 1960. The production of hybrid corn seeds will be organized on a wide scale, first in state farms and also in selection stations and collective farms.
    The draft directives put forward the task of improving the yield per unit area of ​​cotton, flax, hemp, and vegetables, put forward the task of establishing new dairy farms and vegetable planting bases around large cities, and expanding sericulture.
    The draft directives require collective farms and state farms to develop animal husbandry as much as possible. The plan stipulates that the output of meat should be increased, and the way to increase output is primarily to develop the department of animal husbandry that can ensure the fastest increase in meat production—pig raising; the proportion of pork in the total meat output should be increased to 50%. For this purpose, the superiority of using indoor pig raising to produce pork and bacon will be utilized.
    The production of feed will be drastically increased in collective farms and state farms.
    The irrigated area will be expanded by approximately 2.1 million hectares in 5 years, and 3.1 million hectares of drained land will be utilized.
    In water-scarce areas, water supply work will be carried out for approximately 80 million hectares of pastures.
    The level of mechanization in agriculture will be greatly improved. From 1956 to 1960, agriculture will receive approximately 1.65 million tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), including 680,000 cultivating tractors (actual number); 560,000 grain combine harvesters, 180,000 simple harvesters for sectional harvesting of grain, 400,000 light trucks for combine harvesters, and 250,000 combine harvesters for harvesting corn and silage corn.
    Electricity will be widely used in agricultural production. For this purpose, while connecting collective farms and state farms to the national power grid, the construction of district-to-district and regional thermal and hydro power stations will also be organized, and collective farms and state farms will participate in this work.
    The Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates greatly expanding agricultural production in state farms, and stipulates that state farms and sideline enterprises must pay 915 million poods of grain, 1.5 million tons of meat, 6.8 million tons of milk, 79,200 tons of wool, and 2 billion eggs to the state in 1960.
    The fifth part of the draft puts forward the task of further improving the technical level of railway, waterway and highway transportation, widely implementing railway electrification, and supplying all transportation departments with modern and most advanced locomotives and other vehicles. During the period from 1956 to 1960, the railway must increase the volume of freight transport to approximately 1,374 billion ton-kilometers, which is an increase of 42% compared to 1955.
    Approximately 65,000 kilometers of new railway tracks will be laid in the existing railway network, including 58,000 kilometers of heavy-duty tracks. In 5 years, the railway will receive no less than two thousand electric locomotives—including 400 8-axle electric locomotives each with 5,700 horsepower, 2,250 two-section diesel mainline locomotives, no less than 255,000 freight cars, and 18,600 passenger cars.
    Approximately 6,500 kilometers of new railway lines will be laid, which is double the railways built during the Fifth Five-Year Plan. A railway line from Almaty to the border will be built to connect the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in a new direction. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan, 8,100 kilometers of electrified railway lines will be opened to traffic, which is three and a half times that of the previous five-year plan.
    The volume of inland river freight transport will increase by approximately 80%, the volume of sea freight transport will increase by 2.1 times, and the volume of road freight transport will increase by two times. The volume of air freight transport will increase by two times, while the volume of air passenger transport will increase by approximately 3.8 times. The sixth and seventh parts of the draft directives talk about the tasks of basic investment and improving labor productivity. In order to carry out the tasks in developing industry, transportation, agriculture, building houses, schools, hospitals, kindergartens, nurseries, and other cultural and welfare buildings, the total amount of state basic investment in the Soviet national economy from 1956 to 1960 is set at 990 billion rubles (calculated at the prices of July 1, 1955), which is an increase of 67% compared to the Fifth Five-Year Plan.
    From 1956 to 1960, labor productivity in industry will increase by at least 50%. The main ways to achieve this goal will be to increase the technical equipment of labor, adopt new equipment and technological procedures, maximize the full mechanization and automation of production processes, modernize equipment, widely develop the specialization of enterprises and adopt continuous production methods on this basis, fundamentally improve labor organization, eliminate the loss of working time, and reduce labor costs used in auxiliary work, etc.
    The eighth part of the draft, on improving the material and cultural living standards of the people, points out that, according to the tasks of developing socialist production and improving social labor productivity, it is stipulated that the national income will increase by approximately 60% (calculated at comparable prices) during the five-year period. On this basis, the further improvement of the income of workers and staff and the income of farmers will be guaranteed, and the consumption of food and industrial products per capita will also be greatly increased.
    The directives stipulate that the number of industrial workers and other staff working in the Soviet national economy sectors in 1960 will be approximately 55 million.
    The actual wages of workers and staff will increase by an average of approximately 30%.
    Efforts should be made to improve the working and living conditions of female workers, and more benefits should be given to mothers, especially the extension of maternity leave.
    On the basis of greatly increasing the output of agriculture and animal husbandry and increasing the labor productivity of collective farmers, the cash and in-kind income of collective farmers will increase. This income will increase by at least 40% on average, mainly through the increase in public economic income; and the collective farm's public accumulation fund will also increase greatly.
    The directives stipulate increasing the following state expenditures: subsidies and remuneration issued in accordance with the social insurance regulations for workers and staff, pensions under social support, subsidies for mothers with multiple children and single mothers, scholarships for students, free medical care, free or reduced-price admission to sanatoriums and rest homes, free education and training to improve professional skills, paid holidays, and other funds and benefits given to the working people. In 1960, these expenses will increase from 154 billion rubles in 1955 to nearly 210 billion rubles.
    In 5 years, the retail trade volume of state-owned stores and cooperatives will increase by about 50%, and it will be guaranteed that the retail trade in rural areas will increase greatly.
    In 5 years, housing with a living area of ​​approximately 205 million square meters, or a living area nearly doubled compared to the Fifth Five-Year Plan, will be built by the state in various cities, industrial areas, and agricultural areas.
    In urban and agricultural areas, the popularization of secondary education will be basically realized by educating children and young people through regular secondary schools (ten-year system) and secondary specialized schools.
    Tuition fees will be waived for senior classes of secondary schools, secondary specialized schools, and higher education institutions. Compared with the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the total number of specialized talents graduating from higher or secondary schools in 5 years will increase by approximately 50%, and the total number of specialized talents graduating from higher or secondary schools trained for heavy industry, construction, transportation, and agriculture will increase by approximately two times. Make every effort to develop science.
    The draft directives stipulate further developing the film industry, radio broadcasting industry, television broadcasting industry, book publishing industry, public health undertakings, and sports.
    The last part of the draft elaborates in detail the tasks of developing the national economy of each union republic and the tasks of allocating productive forces.
    The draft concludes by saying that the Sixth Five-Year Plan stipulates the further upsurge of the Soviet national economy, primarily the development of heavy industry as the foundation of the socialist economy. The implementation of this plan will mean the further strengthening of the Soviet Union's economic strength and its indestructible national defense forces, the great improvement of the people's living standards, and the upsurge of Soviet culture.
    The completion of the tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan will be a great contribution to the further consolidation of the entire socialist camp.
    The Soviet Union will do everything possible to expand cooperation with people's democratic countries in order to make the most rational use of economic resources and production capacity for common interests by adjusting the development of various sectors of the national economy, by specializing and cooperating in production, and by exchanging scientific and technological achievements and advanced experience in production.
    The Soviet Union has always firmly advocated the possibility and necessity of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and political systems, and will also strive to expand trade with other countries on the basis of mutual benefit.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, when drafting the draft directives of the 20th Party Congress on the Sixth Five-Year Plan, took into account the suggestions put forward by the staff of thousands of industrial enterprises and collective farms. A vast number of workers, collective farm members, industrial and agricultural experts, and scientists participated in preparing and discussing these suggestions. Their patriotic enthusiasm and multifaceted production experience helped the Central Committee to more comprehensively stipulate the tasks of developing various sectors of the national economy during the Sixth Five-Year Plan and to discover the great potential in socialist industry, agriculture, and transportation.

    为了加速提高社会劳动生产率，降低生产成本和提高产品质量，草案规定在第六个五年计划中保证扩大工业中的专业化和协作，在专业化的企业中，组织大规模连续生产。保证各专业化企业按照最新的工艺规程生产标准的、合乎规定的、规格划一的零件、部件和制件。把工业部门、工厂，以及零件、部件和制件的生产合理地分配给各部和个别的企业。在国内各经济区建立专业化企业，并注意到在经济区和大工业中心地域内实现企业的协作。
    草案的第四部分是关于农业问题的。指示规定农业和畜牧业将有急剧的提高。根据计划，1960年谷物的总产量将达到1.8亿吨（110亿普特），在5年内工业原料作物、马铃薯、蔬菜和畜产品的产量增加的规模如下（1960年对1955年产量的百分比）：棉花—156，亚麻—135，甜菜—154，马铃薯—185，蔬菜—218，肉类—200，牛奶—195，鸡蛋—254，羊毛—182。
    为了进一步提高谷物生产，1956年至少将在3，000万公顷已经开垦好的生荒地和熟荒地上进行播种，并且继续开垦生荒地和熟荒地。将大大提高谷物的单位面积产量，并且在最近几年内在全国各地都播种产量高和质量好的、适合在各个地区播种的优良品种的谷物。
    将发展单位面积产量最高的玉蜀黍种植业，到1960年集体农庄和国营农场的玉蜀黍的播种面积至少将增加到2，800万公顷。将在广泛的规模上组织杂交玉蜀黍种子的生产工作，首先将在国营农场，同时也将在选种站和集体农庄进行这项工作。
    指示草案提出了提高棉花、亚麻、大麻、蔬菜的单位面积产量的任务，提出了在大城市周围建立新的奶牛饲养场和蔬菜种植基地以及扩大养蚕业的任务。
    指示草案要求集体农庄和国营农场尽量发展畜牧业。计划规定要增加肉类的产量，增产的途径首先是发展畜牧业中能够保证最快地增加肉产量的部门——养猪业；把猪肉在肉类总产量中所占的比例提高到50％，为了这个目的，将利用舍饲养猪来生产猪肉和腌肉的优越性。
    在集体农庄和国营农场中急剧地增加饲料的生产。
    5年内大约要扩大灌溉面积210万公顷，利用310万公顷排干了积水的土地。
    在缺水地区要为约8，000万公顷的牧场进行供水工作。
    农业的机械化水平将大大地提高。1956年到1960年农业将大约得到165万台拖拉机（每台以15匹马力计算），其中包括68万台中耕拖拉机（实际数目）；56万台谷物联合收获机，18万台用来分段收获谷物的简易收割机，40万辆供联合收获机用的轻运货汽车和25万台收获玉蜀黍和青储玉蜀黍的联合收获机。
    在农业生产中广泛地利用电力，为了这个目的，在把集体农庄和国营农场同国家电力网联接起来的同时，还将组织区与区之间的和地区性的火力和水力发电站的建设，集体农庄和国营农场将参加这项工作。
    第六个五年计划规定大大地扩大国营农场的农业生产，并且规定国营农场和副业企业在1960年必须向国家缴纳91，500万普特粮食、150万吨肉类、680万吨牛奶、79，200吨羊毛和20亿个蛋。
    草案的第五部分提出了进一步提高铁路、水路和公路运输的技术水平、广泛实行铁路电气化和把现代的、最先进的机车和其他车辆供应一切运输部门的任务。在1956年到1960年期间，铁路必须把货运量增加到大约13，740亿吨公里，即比1955年增加42％。
    在现有的铁路网中将铺设约65，000公里的新铁轨，其中包括58，000公里的重轨。在5年中，铁路将得到不少于两千辆的电气机车——其中包括400辆每辆有5，700匹马力的
  8轴电气机车，2，250辆两节柴油干线机车，不少于255，000辆的货车和18，600辆客车。
    将要铺设大约6，500公里的新铁路线，即比第五个五年计划期间建设的铁路增加一倍。将要建筑一条从阿拉木图到国境的铁路线，以便把苏联和中华人民共和国在一个新的方向上连接起来。在第六个五年计划中将有8，100公里的电气铁路线通车，即增为前一个五年计划的三倍半。
    内河货运量将增加大约80％，航海货运量将增加为二点一倍，汽车货运量将增加为两倍。航空货运量将增加为两倍，而航空客运量将增加为约三点八倍。指示草案的第六部分和第七部分谈到基本投资和提高劳动生产率的任务。为了执行在发展工业、运输业、农业，修建住宅、学校、医院、幼儿园、托儿所和其他文化福利建筑物方面的任务，在1956年到1960年期间，苏联国民经济中的国家基本投资总额定为9，900亿卢布（按1955年7月1日价格计算），即比第五个五年计划增加67％。
    在1956年到1960年期间，工业的劳动生产率将至少提高50％，达到这一目的的办法主要将是增加劳动的技术设备，采用新式设备和工艺规程，最大限度地扩大生产过程的全盘机械化和自动化，使设备现代化，广泛发展企业的专业化并且在这个基础上采用连续生产方法，根本改进劳动组织，消灭工作时间的损失和减少用在辅助工作上的劳动耗费等。
    草案关于提高人民的物质和文化生活水平的第八部分指出，根据发展社会主义生产和提高社会劳动生产率的任务，规定五年期间国民收入大约增加60％ （按比较价格计算）。在这个基础上，职工的收入以及农民的收入的进一步提高将得到保证，而且按人口计算的粮食和工业品的消费量也将大大地增加。
    指示规定1960年在苏联国民经济部门工作的产业工人和其他职员约为5，500万人。
    工人和职员的实际工资平均大约增加30％。
    要尽力改善女工的工作和生活条件，并且要给予母亲以更多的优待，特别是产假要予以延长。
    在农业和畜牧业产量大大增加以及集体农民劳动生产率增加的基础上，集体农民的现金和实物收入将要增加，这种收入平均将至少增加40％，主要是通过公有经济收入的增加；而集体农庄的公积金也将大大增加。
    指示规定增加下列各项的国家开支：按照工人和职员的社会保险条例颁发的补助费和酬劳费、社会赡养项下的养老金、多子女母亲和单身母亲的补助金、学生的奖学金、免费医疗、免费或减费进疗养院和休养所，免费教育和提高业务水平的训练、工资照付的假期和给予劳动人民的其他款项和优待。1960年这些经费将由1955年的1，540亿卢布增加到将近2，100亿卢布。
    在5年内，国营商店和合作社零售贸易额将增加50％左右，并且保证使乡村中的零售贸易大大增加。
    在5年内，将由国家出资在各城镇、工业区和农业区建造居住面积约达20，500万平方公尺、或者居住面积比第五个五年计划增加将近一倍的房屋。
    在城市和农业地区将通过正规的中等学校（十年制）和中等专门学校教育儿童和青年的方法来基本上实现普及中等教育制。
    中等学校的高级班、中等专门学校和高等学校将免收学费。和第五个五年计划比较，在5年中高等或中等学校毕业的专门人才总人数将增加大约50％，为重工业、建筑业、运输业和农业培养的从高等或中等学校毕业的专门人才总人数约将增加为两倍。尽一切可能发展科学。
    指示草案规定进一步发展电影业、无线电广播业、电视广播业、图书出版事业、公共卫生事业和体育运动。
    草案最后一部分详细阐明了各加盟共和国发展国民经济的任务和分配生产力的任务。
    草案最后说，第六个五年计划规定苏联国民经济的进一步高涨，首先是作为社会主义经济基础的重工业的发展。这个计划的实现将意味着苏联经济力量和它的牢不可破的国防力量的进一步加强，人民生活水平的大大提高和苏维埃文化的高涨。
    第六个五年计划各项任务的完成对整个社会主义阵营的进一步巩固将是一个巨大的贡献。
    苏联将尽一切可能扩大同人民民主国家的合作，以便为了共同的利益通过调整国民经济的各个部门的发展、通过生产的专门化和合作，并且通过交换科学技术成就和生产上的先进经验，来最合理地利用经济资源和生产能力。
    苏联一贯坚决主张不同社会制度和政治制度的国家有和平共处的可能性和必要性，并且还将努力在遵循互利的基础上扩大同其他国家的贸易。
    苏联共产党中央委员会在起草第二十次党代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案的时候，考虑到了成千上万的工业企业和集体农庄的工作人员所提出的建议。广大的工人、集体农庄庄员、工业和农业专家和科学家们曾参加准备和讨论这些建议。他们的爱国积极性和多方面的生产经验，帮助了中央委员会更全面地规定在第六个五年计划期间发展国民经济的各个部门的任务，发掘出社会主义工业、农业和运输业中的巨大的潜力。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科十五日电）
