    Support Farmers with More Two-Wheel Double-Share Plows
    To the Editor:
    The National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) for 1956-1967 points out an inspiring vision for the development of agricultural production and rural work in our country. This not only gives our 500 million peasant brothers a clearer goal to strive for, but is also closely linked to our current work. Article 11 of the draft program clearly stipulates that 6 million two-wheel double-share plows should be promoted within 3 to 5 years. This arduous and glorious task will be undertaken by us agricultural machinery workers.
    Last year, although our workshop successfully completed the task of producing 40,000 two-wheel double-share plows, this number is far from meeting the actual needs in the face of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization. This year, the task assigned to us by our superiors greatly exceeds that of last year, requiring us to produce 30,000 two-wheel double-share plows in the first quarter alone. With very limited increases in machinery and personnel, the main reliance for completing the task is on everyone发挥 (fā huī - bring into play) their creativity and initiative, promoting advanced experiences, improving technical levels, and constantly breaking old quotas and creating new records.
    Under the leadership of the Party, we are moving in this direction. For example, Liu Shilin, our workshop's model worker at the factory level, has relatively high plowshare grinding skills. Ordinary workers can grind at most 120 pieces a day, while he can grind 180 pieces. Recently, Zhang Kai, an advanced producer in the workshop, proposed a guarantee to break Liu Shilin's quota and strive to reach 280 pieces. Due to this friendly competition and mutual learning, Liu Shilin's quota has now reached 260 pieces. Xu Shihua, a worker in the small assembly team, originally had an assembly welding quota of 280 pieces. On the very day the good news of the Agricultural Development Program arrived, he created a new record of 370 pieces. Although most of the workers in the plowshare assembly team are new, their quota has also increased from 60 pieces per person per day to 90 pieces. This month, the weak link in our workshop's production is the grinding wheel process, and fitter Dong Yucheng and others have volunteered to go to support it.
    Currently, there are difficulties in our path forward, the most prominent of which is uneven production, as well as the phenomenon of work stoppage at the beginning of the month due to waiting for materials, and rushing to work day and night at the end of the month. We are working hard to urge the factory to strengthen leadership in this regard, so that we can better complete our tasks and support our peasant brothers.

### 用更多的双轮双铧犁来支援农民

    用更多的双轮双铧犁来支援农民编辑同志：
    1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要（草案）给我国的农业生产和农村工作的发展指出了一幅振奋人心的远景。这不仅使5万万农民兄弟们有了更明确的奔头了，而且同我们眼前的工作是这样紧密地联系着。纲要草案的第十一条明确规定要在3年至5年内推广双轮双铧犁600万部，这个艰巨而光荣的任务要由我们农业机械工人担当起来。
    去年，我们这个车间虽然胜利地完成了生产4万部双轮双铧犁的任务，但是在农业合作化高潮的面前，这个数字是远远满足不了实际需要的。今年上级给我们的任务大大地超过了去年，光是第一季度就要我们生产双轮双铧犁3万部。机器和人员增加很有限，要完成任务主要依靠大家发挥创造性和积极性，推广先进经验，提高技术水平，不断地突破旧的定额和创造新的纪录。
    在党的领导下，我们正在朝着这个方向前进。例如，我们车间的厂级劳动模范刘世林，磨犁头的技术较高，一般工人每天顶多磨120个，他可以磨180个。最近车间的先进生产者张凯就提出保证，要突破刘世林的定额，争取达到280个。由于这种友谊竞赛和互相学习，现在刘世林的定额已经达到260个了。小装配组工人许世华原来的搬焊组合定额是280个，就在农业发展纲要喜讯传来的当天，他创造了370个的新纪录。装犁头组的工人虽然大多数是新手，但是他们的定额也从每天每人60个提高到90个。这个月，我们车间的生产薄弱环节是磨沙轮这道工序，钳工董羽臣等就自告奋勇地前往支援。
    目前，在我们前进的道路上困难是有的，其中最突出的是生产不均衡，还有月初停工待料、月末日夜赶活的现象。我们正在努力争取厂部加强这方面的领导，以便我们更好地完成任务，支援农民兄弟。
