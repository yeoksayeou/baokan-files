Jiangsu Will Have Telephones in Every Township Next Year

Jiangsu Province's telephone network has gradually expanded from cities to rural areas. Currently, 521 out of the province's 732 districts have telephone service. In the southern Jiangsu region, 701 townships already have telephone service.

The Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Telecommunications has formulated a plan for developing the rural telephone network, requiring that telephone lines be installed in all 211 districts that do not yet have telephone service by 1956. Among them, seven water island areas in Baoshan, Chuansha, and Zhenze counties will use small radio telegraph and telephone stations for communication due to the inability to erect lines. In 1957, efforts will be concentrated on completing the task of installing lines in townships that do not yet have telephone service, so that every township will be equipped with telephones.

　　江苏明年乡乡可通电话
　　江苏省的电话网已经从城市逐步普及到农村。目前，全省732个区中已经有521个区通电话。苏南地区已经有701个乡通电话。　　江苏省电业局已经制定了发展农村电话网的规划，要求在1956年内，将还没有通电话的211个区全部架上电话；其中宝山、川沙、震泽三县有七个水岛地区因不能架线，将改用装设小型无线电报话台通话。1957年，将集中力量解决没有通电话的乡的设线任务，使乡乡都装上电话。
