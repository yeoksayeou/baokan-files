Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    On March 20, 1955, the "Reader's Letters" page published reader's criticisms regarding the lack of seriousness with which the CCP Pingjiang County Committee handled the illegal activities of the former Propaganda Minister of the County Committee, Jia Buyun. On April 4th, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CCP expelled Jia Buyun from the Party, and the Hunan Provincial Higher People's Court arrested Jia Buyun according to the law and handed him over to the Pingjiang County People's Court for trial. On December 8th, the court had already sentenced Jia Buyun to death and carried out the execution after a public trial. The CCP Pingjiang County Committee also sent a letter to examine its own bureaucratic work style and errors in lacking political principles.
