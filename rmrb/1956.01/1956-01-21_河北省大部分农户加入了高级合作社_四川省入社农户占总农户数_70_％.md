Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 20th. By January 19th, the number of farmers in Hebei Province who had joined advanced agricultural production cooperatives had reached more than 70% of the total number of farmers in the province. The province has basically achieved complete socialist agricultural collectivization.

    The person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out that the advanced cooperatives that have now been established all meet the three principles of "voluntary participation by members, strong leadership cadres, and guaranteed income increases for more than 90% of members." In the future, Hebei Province will strive to improve the quality of advanced cooperatives and carry out a production increase campaign. The key to improving quality lies in making good production and labor plans, and clearly explaining the "production increase accounts, labor force accounts, and income accounts" to farmers, guiding the high tide of cooperativization into a high tide of production.

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 20th. Sichuan Province, which ranks first in the country in terms of grain output, has basically achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperation. From the 1st to the 19th, more than 2.4 million farm households in Sichuan Province joined agricultural production cooperatives. To date, the number of farm households joining cooperatives has accounted for 70% of the total number of farm households. Now, more than 201,000 agricultural cooperatives are distributed like stars throughout the province's countryside.

    Sichuan Province has achieved basic cooperativization after a continuous agricultural cooperation upsurge that lasted for more than four months. During these months, a production upsurge that had never occurred in the past emerged throughout the province. The number of small-scale water conservancy projects such as mountain bends, ponds, and canals that have been completed or are under construction is greater than the number in any year in history. More than 32,000 agricultural cooperatives' youth shock brigades have driven millions of rural youth to launch a fertilizer accumulation upsurge.

    河北省大部分农户加入了高级合作社
    四川省入社农户占总农户数70％
    据新华社保定20日电　河北省加入高级农业生产合作社的农户，到1月19日已经达到全省农户总数的70％以上，全省基本上实现了全社会主义的农业合作化。
    中共河北省委员会负责人指出：现在已经成立的高级社，都是符合于“社员自愿、有较强的领导干部、能保证90％以上社员增加收入”三个原则的。今后河北省将努力提高高级社的质量，开展增产运动。提高质量的关键在于作好生产规划和劳动规划，向农民算好“增产账、劳力账、收入账”，把合作化高潮引导到生产高潮中去。
    据新华社成都20日电　粮食产量占全国首位的四川省已经基本上实现了半社会主义的农业合作化。四川省在1日到19日，又有240多万户农民加入了农业生产合作社。至此，入社农户已占农户总数的70％。现在，201，000多个农业社，已经像繁星似地分布在全省的乡村中。
    四川省是经过一个持续四个多月的农业合作化高潮而实现基本合作化的。在这几个月中，全省出现了过去所没有的生产热潮。已经完工和正在施工的山弯塘、渠堰等小型水利工程的数目，比历史上任何一年的数目都大。全省32，000多个农业社的青年突击队，带动几百万农村青年掀起了积肥热潮。
