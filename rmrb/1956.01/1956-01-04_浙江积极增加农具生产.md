    Zhejiang Actively Increases Production of Agricultural Tools
    This year, mechanical manufacturing factories and agricultural tool manufacturing factories in Zhejiang Province plan to produce more than 120,000 units of new-style agricultural tools, such as rice threshers, corn threshers, six-row grain seeders, paddy field plows, and sweet potato shredders, an increase of 11 times compared to last year. In addition, they also plan to produce water pumps, double-wheeled double-furrow plows, and chaff cutters.
    This year, the cost of the five types of agricultural tools, such as rice threshers, produced by factories in Zhejiang Province will be reduced by about 18% to 35% compared to last year. (Huang Cishun)
