International Public Opinion Continues to Condemn Dulles for Advocating "Policy of Strength"

    Soviet Union
    The "Pravda" published an article on the 17th, signed "Observer," commenting on Dulles' recent interview with "Life" magazine and the strong reaction it caused in various countries.
    The article pointed out at the beginning that Dulles' remarks had aroused sharp condemnation around the world, which is completely understandable: because the head of the US foreign policy executive agency stubbornly clung to the "position of strength" policy that has long been untenable, he openly claimed that constantly maintaining international tension at the "edge of war" is the main goal of this policy.
    Why did Dulles publish a talk that caused such a strong reaction? The article replied: One cannot but link Dulles' current remarks on Korea, Indochina, and Taiwan to the efforts of the US aggressive bloc to implement a policy of maintaining tension in these regions. The article used abundant factual material to demonstrate that the people of all countries fiercely oppose the US policy of threats and military provocations against Korea, Indochina, and China, and even within the United States, severe criticisms and protests have been made against this policy. The article said: It is conceivable that Mr. Dulles, anticipating the growth of this sentiment, hoped to re-intensify the international situation in order to quell this voice in the United States and try to achieve a certain degree of unity within the American ruling group on the basis of the policies pursued by the State Department.
    The article said: But Dulles miscalculated. The world's reaction to yet another promotion of the "position of strength" policy proves that it is no longer possible to ignore the changes taking place in the international situation. The people of all countries resolutely despise this bankrupt policy. Implementing such a policy will obviously leave the United States isolated.
    United States
    Important figures in the US Democratic Party continue to attack Dulles for advocating the "edge of war" policy.
    Stevenson, who announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, again accused Dulles' remarks of being "shocking" at a press conference on the 17th, accusing him of "bringing the American people to the brink of war three times" and "bragging that this dangerous adventure is the 'art' of diplomacy that he claims to be proficient in."
    Stevenson said: "Brandishing force, threatening atomic war, and disregarding our allies will not ease tensions, make friends, or make others trust the United States." He said that these practices are likely to confirm that the United States is a threat to peace.
    Stevenson demanded that Eisenhower refute Dulles' remarks or dismiss him.
    Another Democratic presidential candidate, Kefauver, said on the 15th: "We don't want a policy that keeps us on the brink of war all the time. One day, they may not be able to bring us back."
    Britain
    London newspapers continue to comment on Dulles' interview with "Life" magazine.
    The influential "News Chronicle" sharply criticized Dulles, saying that Dulles' remarks were "a terrifying description of American diplomacy." The newspaper said: "The absurdity of this conversation is that it gives the world the impression that the policy of unilateral intimidation is a normal American policy, as if the best way to maintain peace is to carry out terrible atomic intimidation."
    The "News Chronicle" specifically emphasized that the reactions of Asian and Middle Eastern countries, "which are currently the areas of greatest interest to Western diplomacy," to Dulles' remarks were unfavorable to him. The newspaper finally pointed out that "the reckless use of atomic intimidation in the current tense political atmosphere is not in the best interests of the United States."
    Canada
    Canadian newspapers criticized Dulles for his remarks about the "edge of war" policy.
    "The Globe and Mail" said in an editorial that Dulles' words "are his own new version of modern history, and as most observers believe, it is a distorted version."
    The newspaper said: According to Dulles' new theory, "the way to avoid war is to go to the 'edge' of war. As Secretary of State, this is indeed a strange view."
    The "Star" said: The US Secretary of State's remarks that the US government has been very close to using atomic weapons three times can only strengthen a widespread belief in Asia: the West still believes that the large populations of the East are inferior races that can be massacred with nuclear weapons with impunity.

### 各国舆论继续谴责杜勒斯鼓吹“实力政策”

    各国舆论继续谴责杜勒斯鼓吹“实力政策”
    苏联
    “真理报”17日发表了署名“观察家”的一篇文章，评论杜勒斯最近对“生活”杂志的谈话和它在各国引起的强烈反应。
    文章在一开头就指出，杜勒斯的谈话在全世界引起了尖锐的谴责，这是完全可以理解的：因为负责执行美国外交政策的主管机关领导人顽固地抱定早已站不住脚的“实力地位”政策，他公开声称，经常保持国际紧张局势在“战争的边缘”，是这种方针的主要目标。
    为什么杜勒斯要发表一篇引起这样强烈反应的谈话呢？文章回答说：不能不把杜勒斯目前对朝鲜、印度支那和台湾的言论同美国侵略集团力求执行在这些地区保持紧张局势的政策联系起来。文章用丰富的事实材料论证了各国人民激烈反对美国对朝鲜、印度支那和中国所执行的威胁和军事挑衅政策，甚至在美国国内，也对这个政策发出过严厉的批评和抗议。文章说：可以设想得到，杜勒斯先生估计到这种情绪的增长，指望使国际局势重新紧张起来，以使美国的这种呼声消沉下去，设法使美国统治集团在国务院奉行的政策的基础上取得一定程度的团结。
    文章说：但是，杜勒斯失算了。全世界对又一次宣传“实力地位”政策的反应证明，现在已不能再忽略国际局势中发生的变化了。各国人民坚决鄙弃这一已经破产的政策。实行这种政策，显然会使美国处于孤立的地位。
    美国
    美国民主党的重要人物继续抨击杜勒斯鼓吹“战争边缘”政策的谈话。
    宣布要参加民主党总统候选人提名竞选的史蒂文森，17日在记者招待会上再次指责杜勒斯的谈话是“令人震惊的”，指责他说“他曾三次把美国人民带到战争的边缘”，“并且吹嘘这种危险的冒险是他自称精通的外交‘艺术’”。
    史蒂文森说：“炫耀武力、以进行原子战争相威胁以及不理会我们的盟国的做法，不会缓和紧张局势、交上朋友或者使别人信任美国。”他说，这些做法很可能会证实美国是对和平的威胁。
    史蒂文森要求艾森豪威尔驳斥杜勒斯的谈话，或者把他免职。
    另一个民主党总统候选人竞争者克弗维尔15日说：“我们不要一种一直使我们处在战争边缘的政策，有朝一日，他们可能无法把我们带回来。”
    英国
    伦敦各报继续评论杜勒斯对“生活”杂志的谈话。
    有影响的“新闻纪事报”尖锐地抨击杜勒斯，它说杜勒斯的谈话是“美国外交手腕的令人恐怖的描述”。报纸说：“这次谈话的荒唐之处是，使全世界都有了这样一个印象，即认为片面虚声恫吓的政策是美国正常的政策，似乎维护和平最好的方法就是进行可怕的原子恫吓。”
    “新闻纪事报”特别强调说，亚洲国家和中东国家，“也就是西方外交目前最感兴趣的地区”对杜勒斯的谈话的反应是不利于他的。报纸最后指出，“在目前世界紧张的政治气氛中轻率地使用原子恫吓对美国最没有好处。”
    加拿大
    加拿大报纸抨击杜勒斯关于“战争边缘”政策的谈话。
    “环球邮报”在社论里说，杜勒斯的话“是他自己对现代史的新说法，正如极大多数的观察家所认为的，这是一种歪曲的说法”。
    这家报纸说：根据杜勒斯的新理论，“避免战争的方法是走到战争的‘边缘’，作为外交部长，这确实是一种奇怪的看法。”
    “明星报”说：美国国务卿发表的美国政府曾经三次非常接近使用原子武器的谈话，只能增强亚洲广泛具有的一种信念：西方仍然认为东方众多的人民是可以用核子武器来加以残害而不受惩罚的低等种族。
