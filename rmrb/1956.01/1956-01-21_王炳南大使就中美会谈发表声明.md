Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, January 20th: Ambassador Wang Bingnan, the representative of the People's Republic of China to the Sino-US Ambassadorial talks, issued the following statement to the press here on January 20th:

    Due to delays by the US side, the Sino-US Ambassadorial talks have not yet been able to reach an agreement on the second item on the agenda. People all over the world, including the people of China and the United States, do not understand the truth about the talks, and American news agencies and even official American agencies are arbitrarily distorting the content of the talks. This situation is not permissible. In view of this, the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on January 18, announcing the course of the Sino-US talks and explaining China's position. This is precisely an attitude of responsibility to the people. Therefore, we cannot agree with the contrary view expressed by Ambassador Johnson in his statement on January 18.

    Ambassador Johnson mentioned the agreement between the two sides on the release of news. According to this agreement reached on August 2, 1955, if one party believes it is necessary to publish news about the talks, it should notify the other party in advance. Regarding the Chinese side's intention to issue a statement, I had already notified the US side at the meeting on January 12; this is something Ambassador Johnson is clearly aware of. Therefore, the actions taken by the Chinese side are fully in accordance with the agreement, and the implication made by Ambassador Johnson in the opposite direction is unfounded.

    The Chinese statement clarifies China's position and states the true situation of the talks. It not only does not distort or misrepresent any facts, but on the contrary, it is a comprehensive correction and clarification of all distortions and misrepresentations about the Sino-US talks up to now.

    We hope that the talks will no longer be delayed and that an agreement will be reached quickly. Otherwise, we will continue to publish the course of the talks.

    王炳南大使就中美会谈发表声明
    新华社日内瓦20日电　中华人民共和国出席中美两国大使级会谈的代表王炳南大使1月20日在此间向报界发表声明如下：
    由于美方的拖延，中美大使级会谈至今没有能够对第二项议程达成协议。全世界人民包括中美两国人民在内都不明了会谈的真相，而美国通讯社甚至美国官方机关却任意对会谈内容进行歪曲，这种情况是不能容许的。有鉴于此，中国外交部发言人在1月18日发表声明，公布中美会谈的经过，说明中国方面的立场，这正是对人民负责的态度。因此，我们不能同意约翰逊大使在他1月18日的声明里所表示的相反的看法。
    约翰逊大使提到了双方关于发布新闻的协议。根据这个在1955年8月2日达成的协议，如果一方认为有必要发表有关会谈的消息，应该事先通知对方。关于中国方面将发表声明一事，我在1月12日会上就已经通知了美方；这是约翰逊大使清楚知道的。因此，中国方面所采取的行动是完全符合协议的，约翰逊大使所作的朝着相反方向的暗示是没有根据的。
    中国的声明阐明了中国方面的立场，陈述了会谈的真实情况。它不仅没有对任何事实进行歪曲和曲解，相反，它正是对于一直到现在的关于中美会谈的各种歪曲和曲解的一个全面的纠正和澄清。
    我们希望会谈不再拖延，迅速达成协议。否则，我方将继续公布会谈的经过。
