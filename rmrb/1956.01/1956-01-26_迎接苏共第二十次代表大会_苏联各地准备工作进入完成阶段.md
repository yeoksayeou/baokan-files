    To Welcome the 20th Congress of the CPSU
    Preparations in Various Parts of the Soviet Union Enter Completion Phase
    (Dispatch from our Moscow correspondent) Preparations to welcome the 20th Congress of the CPSU have entered the completion phase. In order to mobilize all forces to realize the great tasks of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, and to summarize the experience of the Party's work, local Party representative conferences have been held in various districts and cities in the Soviet Union, and Party representative conferences in many states and border regions, as well as the Communist Party congresses of various Union Republics, are successively completing their work.
    The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine, held in Kiev, closed on the 22nd. Like the Party congresses of other Soviet Union Republics, it reflected the prosperity of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union and their firm will to unite closely around the Central Committee of the CPSU and work together to build a communist society.
    During the five-day session, the Communist Party Congress of Ukraine discussed and unanimously supported the draft directives of the 20th Congress of the CPSU on the Sixth Five-Year Plan; listened to the work report of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Party and unanimously recognized the correctness of the political line of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Party; pointed out in the adopted resolution the ways to improve the work of the Ukrainian Party organizations and enhance their level of leadership in economic and cultural construction; and elected the Central Committee.
    In his report to the Congress, Kirichenko, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, said: The total industrial output of Ukraine, calculated in value, was 93 billion rubles in 1950 and 177 billion rubles in 1955. In five years, 80 billion rubles were invested in industry, and 142 coal mines, 11 blast furnaces and 26 open-hearth furnaces, 18 steel rolling and tube rolling mills, 7 machine-building factories and many other enterprises were built. Coal mining has increased by 25.5% in the last two years. Ukraine completed the state grain procurement plan ahead of schedule last year, delivering 159 million poods of grain over the plan. Last year, 919,000 tons more milk were produced than the previous year. Collective farms and state farms in Ukraine plan to produce 2.122 billion poods of grain in 1960 and livestock products that are one to two times higher than in 1954. In the last two years, Ukraine has built more than 6 million square meters of housing in cities and 170,000 houses in the countryside. Ukraine currently has more than 30,000 schools and 134 universities, where 5.5 million students and more than 212,000 university students are studying, respectively.
    The reporter said: The organizational work experience of the Republic's Party organizations has become richer, and the connection with the masses has been strengthened. However, formalism and routine exist in the work of some Party organizations. Individual Party organizations have neglected to solve the pressing and specific tasks of factories, farms and institutions. The Republic's Party organizations have improved propaganda and agitation work and strengthened propaganda cadres. However, the situation of ideological work still does not meet the requirements of the Party, the government and the people. The main shortcomings of the Party's propaganda and political agitation lie in being divorced from the practice of communist construction and from the current practical tasks.
    The reporter concluded by saying: The Ukrainian Communists will unite more closely around the Central Committee of the CPSU and will continue to advance in the vanguard in the struggle for the victory of the great cause of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.

### 迎接苏共第二十次代表大会  苏联各地准备工作进入完成阶段

    迎接苏共第二十次代表大会
    苏联各地准备工作进入完成阶段
    本报莫斯科专电　迎接苏共第二十次代表大会的准备工作已经进入完成阶段。为了动员一切力量实现第六个五年计划的巨大任务，为了总结党的工作经验，苏联各地已经开过区、市的党代表会议和许多州、边疆的党代表会议，各加盟共和国共产党的代表大会也相继完成着自己的工作。
    基辅举行的乌克兰共产党第十九次代表大会在22日闭幕。它和苏联其他加盟共和国的党代表大会，反映了苏联各民族的繁荣和它们紧密地团结在苏共中央周围共同努力建设共产主义社会的意志。
    乌克兰共产党代表大会在5天的会议中讨论了并一致拥护苏共第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示草案；听取了乌克兰党中央的工作报告和一致承认乌克兰党中央政治路线的正确；在通过的决议中指出改进乌克兰党组织的工作和提高它们领导经济和文化建设的水平的办法；选举了中央委员会。
    乌克兰共产党中央委员会第一书记基里钦科向代表大会所作的报告中说：乌克兰的工业总产量以价值计算，在1950年为930亿卢布，在1955年为1，770亿卢布。5年中向工业投资了800亿卢布，建成了142座煤矿，11座高炉和26座平炉，18座轧钢轧管机，7座机器制造厂和许多其他企业。最近两年采煤量增加了25.5％。乌克兰去年提前完成了国家采购粮食计划，超计划多交了15，900万普特谷物。去年比前年多产了919，000吨牛奶。乌克兰集体农庄和国营农场规划了在1960年将产212，200万普特谷物和比1954年高一两倍的畜产品。乌克兰最近两年在城市建筑了600多万平方公尺住宅，在乡村建筑了17万栋房子。乌克兰现有3万多所学校和134所高等学校，550万学生和212，000多大学生在那里分别学习着。
    报告人说：共和国党组织的组织工作经验更丰富了，同群众的联系更加强了。但在某些党组织的工作中存在形式主义和陈规老套。个别党的组织忽视了解决工厂、农庄和机关的迫切的具体的任务。共和国党的组织改进了宣传和鼓动工作，增强了宣传干部。但是思想工作情况还不符合党、政府和人民的要求。党的宣传和政治鼓动的主要缺点在于脱离共产主义建设的实际，脱离当前的实际任务。
    报告人最后说：乌克兰共产党人将更加紧密地团结在苏共中央周围，还将在为马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林伟大事业胜利而斗争的先锋队伍中前进。
