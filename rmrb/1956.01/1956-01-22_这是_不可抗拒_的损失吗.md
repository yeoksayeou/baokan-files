Is This an "Irresistible" Loss?

To the Editor:

From July to December 1955, the joint inspection team of the Harbin Municipal Bureau of Supervision inspected the work of the Xinyang and Guxiang business departments of the Municipal Timber Company. According to preliminary statistics, these two business departments lost and wasted more than 100,000 yuan of state wealth.

　　In the lumberyard of the Xinyang business department, everywhere was filled with sewage, and piles of timber were soaked in water year after year. Some had grown thick moss, large mushrooms, or lush green grass. Large quantities of finished timber thus became rotten wood. From July 1954 to May 1955, 87,395 kilograms of finished timber that had been crushed, broken, and rotted were cleared out of the yard and had to be sold at reduced prices. This item alone caused a loss of nearly 30,000 yuan. Due to the scattered and disorganized placement of timber and the lack of management, more than 2,000 cubic meters of timber went missing at the end of 1954.

　　The Xinyang business department also often allowed private merchants to load timber onto their vehicles in the lumberyard themselves. No one cared about how much they loaded or what they loaded. As a result, some unscrupulous merchants stole timber by the truckload, while others engaged in speculative trading on the spot. One unscrupulous merchant even infiltrated the workforce as a worker and colluded with other unscrupulous merchants to systematically stack good timber among inferior timber, buying it at low prices and selling it at high prices.

　　The situation in the Guxiang business department was not much better. In one lumberyard, there were three to four thousand cubic meters of timber, but there were neither inventory records nor custodians. When we went to this lumberyard in August and September 1955, the weeds around the timber had grown taller than our knees, and we were stepping on a mixture of rotten wood and soil. We only walked through the timber stacks a few times, and our bodies were covered in spiderwebs. In the heart of a large log that had already rotted, tender green grass had grown…

　　Faced with such serious phenomena, the relevant leading personnel, who were entrusted with important responsibilities by the state, did not feel any remorse. Vice Manager Wang of the Municipal Timber Company and Director Shi of the Xinyang business department, among others, said: The timber company has been established for a short time, there are many objective difficulties, little work experience, and chaotic management is inevitable. A little waste is irresistible… People who are so negligent and indifferent to state property should be punished as they deserve.

### 这是“不可抗拒”的损失吗

    这是“不可抗拒”的损失吗编辑同志：
    1955年7月到12月，哈尔滨市监察局联合检查组检查了市木材公司新阳、顾乡两个营业部的工作。据初步统计，这两个营业部共损失和浪费国家财富10万多元。
    在新阳营业部的贮木场里，到处都积满着污水，成堆木材长年累月泡在水里，有的已经长上了厚厚的藓苔、肥大的蘑菇或者茂盛的青草。大批成材就这样成了朽木。从1954年7月到1955年5月，在场里清理出来87，395公斤被踩碎、轧断和已经腐朽的成材，只得减价出卖。这一项所造成的损失近3万元。由于木材散置乱放，无人经管，1954年末有二千多立方公尺木材没有下落了。
    新阳营业部还常常让私商到贮木场里自行装车拉木材。究竟拉了多少？拉了些什么？谁也不管。因此，有的奸商就成车往外偷，有的就在现场内买空卖空，有一个奸商干脆混进来当工人，同其他奸商合谋，有计划地把好材垛到次材中，用低价买去、高价出卖。
    顾乡营业部的情况也好不了多少。在一个贮木场里放着三、四千立方公尺的木材，可是既没有保管账，也没有保管员。1955年8、9月份我们到这个贮木场去，木材周围的野草都长得有过膝高，我们脚下踩踏的都是朽木和泥土的混合物。我们仅仅在木材垛中走了几趟，身上就黏了很多蜘蛛网。有一棵已经朽烂的粗大的元木的木心里，已长出了嫩绿的青草……。
    对于这样严重的现象，身负国家重托的有关领导人员们竟然丝毫不觉得痛心。市木材公司的王副经理、新阳营业部的史主任等都说：木材公司建立的时间短，客观困难多，工作经验少，经营管理混乱是必然的，浪费一点是人力不可抗拒的……。这样玩忽职守、对国家财产漠不关心的人，应该受到应得的处分。
