　　Actively Strive to Complete the First Five-Year Production Plan Ahead of Schedule
    (Our Newspaper News) The Ministry of Petroleum Industry is actively taking measures to strive to complete the first five-year production plan ahead of schedule. According to the 1956 production plan draft recently formulated by the Ministry and currently being submitted to the State Council for review, by the end of 1956, the total output value of the national petroleum industry can reach the level of 1957.
    The Ministry of Petroleum Industry recently held a factory and mine directors meeting to study ways to complete the first five-year production plan ahead of schedule. The meeting required all units to conduct comprehensive planning, determine basic measures, promote advanced experience, and strengthen leadership. The meeting also determined that this year, in addition to expanding the scale of natural petroleum exploration and accelerating the discovery of new oilfield reserves, the Yumen Oil Mine will continue to strengthen oilfield water and gas injection and hydraulic fracturing methods to increase oil well production. This year, the petroleum industry sector plans to develop some small oilfields and oil layers in Yumen and Xinjiang to increase the production of natural crude oil. The petroleum industry sector also plans to take light oil recovery measures in terms of synthetic petroleum. Petroleum Factory No. 5 and Petroleum Factory No. 6 are also preparing for expansion to expand the production capacity of synthetic petroleum.
    (Xinhua News Agency News) The Ministry of Textile Industry is taking active measures to require its subordinate production enterprises to complete the first five-year plan ahead of schedule.
    At the recent National Textile Factory Directors Conference held by the Ministry of Textile Industry, measures to ensure the completion of the 1956 production plan were specifically discussed and formulated. The person in charge of the Ministry of Textile Industry said at the meeting that there are many favorable conditions for the early completion of the first five-year plan by the production enterprises under the Ministry of Textile Industry. He pointed out that this year, the main raw materials of the textile industry in various parts of the country have achieved unprecedented harvests, and many raw materials needed by the cotton textile industry can be supplied relatively adequately. Therefore, in 1956, cotton textile mills, worsted wool mills, and flax textile mills can carry out three-shift production. The four new cotton textile mills originally planned to start production in 1957 can also be completed ahead of schedule and put into production in 1956. The private textile industry, which accounts for a large proportion of the national textile industry, will basically be able to complete the socialist transformation in 1955, creating important conditions for improving and improving the production level of these enterprises. In the future, with the great development of the agricultural cooperative movement, the supply of raw materials for the cotton textile industry will improve day by day; the demand for cotton textiles by the broad masses of the people will also increase day by day. Therefore, the textile industry sector must take various effective measures to produce more high-quality and inexpensive textiles.
    (Xinhua News Agency, 4th) Production enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry are taking measures to strive to complete the five-year production plan ahead of schedule. The 1956 production plan draft recently compiled by the Ministry of Light Industry stipulates that the output value and output of industries such as papermaking, rubber, salt making, medicine, cigarettes, sugar, wine, and oils can approach or exceed the 1957 targets. This draft plan is being submitted to the State Council for review.
    Currently, the production enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry are preparing to vigorously mobilize the masses of employees to discuss methods for improving production technology and management, and will take various measures to tap the potential of existing enterprises and improve product quality. It is estimated that if each production enterprise can actively tap potential, it can increase the country's wealth by more than 250 million yuan in 1956. The production enterprises under the Ministry of Light Industry are also preparing to strengthen experimental research in 1956, produce 43 new products, and begin trial production of more than 200 new products.
    The Ministry of Light Industry recently held a capital construction work conference, deciding to complete the 25 key projects originally planned to be completed in the next two years ahead of schedule, and to start construction on the 18 key projects originally planned to be constructed after 1957 ahead of schedule. In addition, six new construction projects will be added in the next two years. This new plan was formulated by the Ministry of Light Industry after conducting investigations and research on light industry resources and social needs; it is now being submitted to the State Council for review.
    Among the projects that the Ministry of Light Industry has decided to start construction and complete ahead of schedule are paper mills, pharmaceutical factories, rubber factories, sugar factories, salt fields, canneries, glass factories, and aromatic refining factories. After these factories are completed ahead of schedule, they will increase the country's production of paper, sugar, and canned fruits by tens of thousands of tons, and will also be able to increase the production of medicines, rubber, and the like.

　　积极争取提前完成第一个五年生产计划
    本报讯　石油工业部积极采取措施，争取提前完成第一个五年生产计划。根据这个部最近制定的、正在提交国务院审查的1956年生产计划草案计算，到1956年年底，全国石油工业的生产总值可以达到1957年的水平。
    石油工业部最近召开的厂矿长会议，研究了提前完成第一个五年生产计划的办法。会议要求各单位都进行全面规划，确定基本措施，推广先进经验和加强领导。会议并确定在今年除扩大天然石油的勘探规模，加速探明新油田的储油量以外，还将在玉门油矿继续加强油田注水注气和水力压裂的采油方法，以提高油井的产量。今年，石油工业部门准备在玉门和新疆两地开发一些小油田和油层，增加天然原油的产量。石油工业部门还计划在人造石油方面采取轻质油回收的措施。石油五厂和石油六厂，也正在准备扩建，以扩大人造石油的生产能力。
    据新华社讯　纺织工业部采取积极措施，要求所属生产企业提前完成第一个五年计划。
    纺织工业部最近举行的全国纺织厂厂长会议上，具体讨论并制定了保证完成1956年生产计划的措施。纺织工业部的负责人在会上说，纺织工业部所属各生产企业提早完成第一个五年计划，是有很多有利条件的。他指出，今年全国各地纺织工业的主要原料获得空前丰收，棉纺织工业需要的许多原料，可以得到比较充足的供应。因此，在1956年内，棉纺织厂、精纺毛织品厂、麻纺织厂都可以进行三班生产，原计划1957年开工生产的四个新棉纺织厂，也能提前建成，并且可以在1956年投入生产。全国纺织业中占很大比重的私营纺织业，1955年基本上能够完成社会主义改造，为改进和提高这些企业的生产水平创造了重要条件。今后，随着农业合作化运动的大发展，棉纺织工业原料的供应情况，将一天比一天好转；广大人民群众对棉纺织品的需要量也会一天天地增多。因此，纺织工业部门必须采取各种有效措施，生产出更多物美价廉的纺织品。
    据新华社4日讯　轻工业部所属的生产企业正在采取措施，争取提前完成五年生产计划。轻工业部最近编制的1956年生产计划草案规定：造纸、橡胶、制盐、医药、卷烟、糖、酒、油脂等工业的产值和产量，都可以接近或超过1957年的指标。这个计划草案正在报请国务院审查中。
    目前，轻工业部所属的生产企业，正准备大力发动职工群众讨论改进生产技术和管理工作的办法，并且将采取各种措施发掘现有企业的潜在能力和提高产品质量。预计，各个生产企业如果都能积极挖掘潜在能力，1956年就能为国家增产2·5亿多元的财富。轻工业部所属的生产企业还准备在1956年加强试验研究工作，生产43种新产品，并且开始试制二百多种新产品。
    轻工业部最近召开基本建设工作会议，决定把原计划在今明两年建成的25个重点工程提前建成，把原计划在1957年以后施工的18个重点工程提前施工。另外，今明两年还要增加六个新的工程项目。这个新的计划，是轻工业部经过对轻工业资源和社会需要进行了调查研究以后制定的；现在正在报请国务院审查中。
    轻工业部决定提前施工和建成的工程中，有造纸厂、制药厂、橡胶厂、糖厂、盐场、罐头厂、玻璃厂、芳香精炼厂等。这些工厂提前建成以后，将为国家增产纸、糖、水果罐头各几万吨，并且能够增产药品、橡胶等。
