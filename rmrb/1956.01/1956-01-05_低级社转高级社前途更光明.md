　　The Future is Brighter for Lower-Level Cooperatives Transitioning to Higher-Level Cooperatives
　　By our reporter Shang Kai
　　After the autumn harvest, the members of the Liaoyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wang Village, Xieyu County, Shanxi Province, were busy discussing and preparing for the transition to a higher-level cooperative. The Wang Village Party Branch and cooperative committee members were even busier. They needed to deeply understand the thoughts of the cooperative members and study and resolve new problems arising during the transition. The lights in the cooperative office sometimes burned all night.

　　Advancing by Constantly Resolving Contradictions

　　The Liaoyuan Cooperative was established in the spring of 1953. It currently has 381 households with 1,702 male and female members. The cooperative has 8,505 mu of land. The terrain is flat and seemingly boundless. Since the establishment of the cooperative three years ago, production has seen leaping development. Seed cotton, with a yield of 176 jin per mu in 1952, reached 319 jin per mu in 1955, an increase of 81.2% compared to before the establishment of the cooperative. Wheat, with a yield of 78 jin per mu in 1952, reached 145 jin and 13 liang per mu in 1955, an increase of 85.9% compared to before the establishment of the cooperative. Autumn grain, with a yield of 134 jin per mu in 1952, reached 243 jin per mu in 1955, an increase of 81.3% compared to before the establishment of the cooperative. The average total output value per mu (of the main crops cotton, wheat, and autumn grain) was 25.44 yuan in 1952 and 47.43 yuan in 1955, an increase of 86.4% compared to before the establishment of the cooperative.

　　The Liaoyuan Cooperative is a semi-socialist cooperative, maintaining a profit distribution system based on the proportion of land and labor. With the rapid development of productive forces, the contradiction between the labor remuneration portion and the land remuneration portion has become increasingly significant. The Liaoyuan Cooperative began to actively address this contradiction in the second year of its establishment. In 1953, the distribution ratio for land was 40%. By 1954, it was reduced to 38%. In 1955, land remuneration was changed to fixed quantitative distribution, accounting for 29.7% of the cooperative's total net income that year. Although the land distribution ratio decreased year by year, the speed of the decrease lagged far behind the development of production, and those with more land still benefited more. In 1953, each land share received 9.34 yuan. In 1954, each land share received 11.20 yuan. In 1955, after changing to fixed quantitative distribution, each land share was fixed at 7 yuan. Although this was actually lower than the previous two years, land distribution still accounted for 29.7% of the cooperative's net income, totaling 70,014 yuan. It is clear that this portion of wealth created by labor was being taken by land. Therefore, it aroused dissatisfaction among the majority of cooperative members with little land and more labor. What about cooperative members with more land? They relied on land distribution and did not actively participate in the cooperative's labor.

　　The cooperative committee made two statistics on the labor situation of cooperative members in 1955: (1) The cooperative had 827 male and female laborers. If their labor potential was fully utilized, they could complete 120,000 labor days throughout the year. However, in 1955, they actually only completed 105,000 labor days, with an average of only 126.9 labor days per laborer throughout the year. (2) Of the 827 male and female laborers in the cooperative, only 677 were regularly present in 1955, with an attendance rate of only 82%. From this, it can be seen that the private ownership system of land in the Liaoyuan Cooperative severely restricted the full play of cooperative members' enthusiasm for labor. Changing the private ownership of the means of production to public ownership, and changing the semi-socialist agricultural cooperative into a completely socialist agricultural cooperative, has become the common demand of the majority of cooperative members.

　　When it is Time for the "Fruit to Ripen"

　　The Wang Village Party Branch conducted a detailed investigation and repeated study of the political, economic, and other aspects of the Liaoyuan Cooperative, and believed that it had the conditions to transition to a higher-level cooperative.

　　First, with the rapid development of production, the income of cooperative members has generally increased compared to before joining the cooperative. In 1955, the average income per person increased to 170.5 yuan, an increase of 74.7% compared to the year before joining the cooperative. The lives of the vast majority of cooperative members have exceeded the level of ordinary middle peasants in the local area. According to the average living expenses of ordinary middle peasants of 127.27 yuan per person per year, 233 households out of the 353 households in the cooperative (excluding the 28 households that joined in the winter of 1955) exceeded this level, accounting for 66%. 108 households reached this level, accounting for 30.6%. Only 12 households fell below this level, accounting for 3.4%.

　　If land dividends are abolished, will it reduce the income of cooperative members and affect their lives? The cooperative committee conducted trial calculations and pre-distribution based on the production plan target of increasing production by 54.6% in 1956 compared to 1955, and on the basis of further tapping labor potential and increasing labor attendance rates. They compared this household by household with the income of 1955. The result was: 346 households out of the 353 households would exceed their 1955 income, accounting for 98.02%. Only four households were completely old, weak, sick, and disabled with no labor force, and could be subsidized by the cooperative's public welfare fund.

　　Second, the cooperative has accumulated 90,250 yuan in public property over the past three years. Most of this has been used to purchase means of production, mainly including: one truck, 38 large carts, 50 new-style waterwheels, three diesel water pumps, 18 double-wheeled double-furrow plows, eight new-style walking plows, three seeders, and 11 sprayers and dusters, and 308 head of livestock. The socialist economic strength has grown significantly.

　　Third, with the growth of the socialist economy in the cooperative and the annual decrease in land remuneration, the cooperative members' private ownership concept of means of production such as land, livestock, and farm tools has gradually faded, and the concept of labor has been further strengthened. Most poor and lower-middle peasants actively demanded the abolition of land dividends. Many people who used to think that "land and cattle are mountains to rely on" now say that "the cooperative is our lifeline." Loving labor, loving the collective, and cherishing public property have become the atmosphere of the entire cooperative.

　　Fourth, the production and life of the 17 households of orphans, widows, and the elderly in the cooperative can all be properly arranged. Thirteen of them can be assigned to raise pigs, chickens, and ducks, pick cotton, accumulate fertilizer, or do some minor agricultural labor. The four households that have completely lost their labor force can be maintained with an annual subsidy of 1,500 jin of grain from the cooperative. The cooperative members said well: "If we carefully harvest and thresh the more than 8,000 mu of land in the entire cooperative, we can solve their livelihood problems." In fact, the Liaoyuan Cooperative has been doing this for a long time.

　　Fifth, over the years, the cooperative has cultivated a group of production leaders: 15 cooperative committee members, 36 production team leaders and deputy team leaders, and 35 various technical and management personnel. They have accumulated a relatively complete set of experiences in production management, labor management, financial management, and agricultural technology. The cooperative has 21 Communist Party members, 29 Communist Youth League members, and more than 40 mass activists. This is the core force leading all cooperative members in socialist construction.

　　Still a Sharp Ideological Struggle

　　Although the Liaoyuan Cooperative has the conditions to transform into a higher-level cooperative, some cooperative members still experienced intense ideological fluctuations during the transition. According to investigations by the Wang Village Party Branch and the Liaoyuan Cooperative Committee, out of 381 households, 240 households actively supported the transition to a higher-level cooperative, accounting for 62.8% of all cooperative members. Most of these were poor and lower-middle peasants. They generally reflected that "listening to the Communist Party and running a higher-level cooperative is correct." Li Yingjie, a cooperative member in his 60s, said: "I never thought I would see socialism in my lifetime." He was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth all day long. Of course, there were also individual poor peasants who were still reluctant to part with their small piece of land that they had earned with their hard work. For example, cooperative member Li Zhenggao originally had no land. After years of hard work, he finally bought one mu of land. After joining the cooperative, he once said: "Without this one mu of land, I couldn't join the cooperative and couldn't turn over. This one mu of land is my lifeline." Now that he heard that land dividends were to be abolished, he felt so heartbroken that he couldn't sleep for several nights. However, when he thought that the labor dividend in 1955 was 800 yuan, a hundred times more than his land dividend, he finally overcame his private mentality and raised his hands in support.

　　There were 93 households who neither opposed nor actively supported the transition to a higher-level cooperative, expressing that they would follow along. These people were mainly middle peasants with equal land and labor, and their political awareness was not very high. However, they proved from their own experience that following the Communist Party on the road of collectivization over the years had resulted in increased income every year. They were not alarmed when they heard that land dividends were to be abolished, and they held a "however it changes, however it is arranged" attitude.

　　More than 40 households were greatly shaken by the transition to a higher-level cooperative, mainly orphans, widows, the elderly, and wealthier middle peasant households with more land. Among them, orphans, widows, and the elderly actively supported the socialist road, but when they first heard that land dividends were to be abolished, they once felt fear. For example, Yan Zizhong's mother had always lived on the land her son left for her retirement. As soon as she heard the slightest rumor about the abolition of land dividends, she immediately went to the cooperative director, fearing that her son would not support her. As long as the cooperative clearly explained the policies and methods for taking care of orphans, widows, and the elderly, they would quickly settle down. The situation was not the same for wealthy middle peasants with more land. They had some resistance to the abolition of land dividends. For example, the wealthy middle peasant Du Fengshou was very dissatisfied when he heard that land dividends were to be abolished. The cooperative notified him to attend a meeting, but he did not attend three times, sitting at home and sulking.

　　Based on these situations among the cooperative members, the Wang Village Branch and the Liaoyuan Cooperative Committee, in addition to repeatedly conducting collectivist ideological education and education on labor creating the world, also actively led the cooperative members to study and discuss the national Five-Year Plan and the production plans of the entire province, county, and cooperative, so that the cooperative members could see the beautiful prospects of socialist construction from far to near. According to the Liaoyuan Cooperative's production plan, in 1956, machine耕作 will be implemented on 95% of the land, all dry land will be transformed into paddy fields, and the cotton field area will be expanded to 4,300 mu. The replanting area of wheat fields will reach 90%. This will lay a solid foundation for large-scale high yields. On this basis, by 1962, the total agricultural output value of the entire cooperative will reach 1,390,350 yuan. On the basis of continuous growth in production, by 1962, the average income per cooperative member will increase to 880 yuan. This picture of a happy life, in the eyes of the cooperative members, is no longer a distant prospect, but something that has come before their eyes. This is not only a great encouragement to cooperative members with less land, but also a reassurance for wealthy middle peasant cooperative members with more land. For example, Zhai Xiaowu, who had greater ideological resistance in the past, said: "Like this, the future is brighter after transitioning to a higher-level cooperative." Cui Junchang, who had more land and less labor, also said: "As long as the cooperative's piles of grain are piled high, we won't lose much money by receiving less from this little bit of land." After this period of ideological education, the vast majority of cooperative members actively supported the transition to a higher-level cooperative, and the cooperative members' enthusiasm for labor was unprecedentedly high. Now, every household in the cooperative is calculating labor power and making plans to strive for more labor days in 1956. Zhai Ledao, a cooperative member in his 60s, was very moved when studying and discussing the production plan. He composed a clapper talk and sang it happily in the crowd. The lyrics are: "Cooperative members, cheer up and work hard, our cooperative has a boundless future. Next year, iron oxen will run all over the land, and two canals will be built. Water will be drawn from the south of the village and irrigated to the north of the village. Machine耕作 is deep and good. Don't be afraid of not distributing land dividends. If the crops don't grow, it's up to it! As long as we harvest a lot of grain, we don't have to worry about lacking food or drink!"

　　低级社转高级社前途更光明
    本报记者　商恺
    山西省解虞县王村燎原农业生产合作社的社员们，秋收以后就忙着讨论和酝酿转高级社的问题。王村党支部和社务委员们，更加忙碌。他们要深入了解社员们的思想情况，要研究和解决过渡阶段发生的新问题。合作社办公室里的灯光，有时候彻夜长明。
    在不断地解决矛盾中前进
    燎原社是在1953年春天建立的。现有农户381户，男女社员1，702人。入社土地共有8，505亩。地势平坦，一望无边。建社三年以来，生产有飞跃的发展。籽棉，1952年亩产176斤，1955年亩产319斤，比建社前提高81.2％。小麦，1952年亩产78斤，1955年亩产145斤13两，比建社前提高85.9％。秋粮，1952年亩产134斤，1955年亩产243斤，比建社前提高81.3％。每亩平均总产值（棉、麦、秋主要作物），1952年是25.44元，1955年则为47.43元，比建社前提高86.4％。
    燎原社是半社会主义性质的合作社，一直保持着土地和劳力的比例分益制度。随着生产力的迅速发展，劳力报酬部分和土地报酬部分的矛盾日益显著。燎原社从建社的第二年，便开始主动地去解决这个矛盾。1953年——建社的第一年，土地的分益比例是40％，到1954年，便降到38％，1955年土地报酬又改为定量分益，占这年全社纯收入的29.7％。土地分益比例虽然逐年下降，但是下降的速度还远远落在生产发展的后边，仍然是土地越多的得利越多。1953年每一个土地股便分到9.34元，1954年每一个土地股便分到11.20元。1955年改为定量分益后，每个土地股固定为7元，虽然实际上比前二年有所降低，但是土地分益仍占全社纯收益的29.7％，合人民币70，014元。这一部分由劳动创造的财富，很明显地被土地占取了去。因此，引起了广大地少劳力多的社员的不满。土地多的社员们呢？则依仗着土地分益，不积极参加社里的劳动。
    社务委员会对1955年社员劳动情况作了两项统计：（一）全社男女劳动力827个，如果充分发挥劳动潜力，全年可作到12万个劳动日。但是实际上1955年才作了10.5万个劳动日，全年平均每个劳力只作126.9个劳动日。（二）全社男女劳力827个，1955年经常出勤的只有677人，出勤率仅占82％。由此看来，燎原社的土地私人占有制度，严重地限制了社员劳动积极性的发挥。变生产资料私有制为公有制，变半社会主义的农业合作社为完全社会主义的农业合作社，已经成了广大社员的普遍要求。
    到了“瓜熟蒂落”的时候
    王村党支部具体地调查和反复地研究了燎原社政治、经济等各方面的情况，认为已经具备了转高级社的条件。
    第一，随着生产的迅速发展，社员的收入已比入社前普遍提高。1955年，每人平均收入增加到170.5元，比入社前一年增长了74.7％。绝大多数社员的生活已超过了当地一般中农生活的水平。据一般中农每人每年平均需要生活费127.27元。如果以此为标准，那末，全社353户社员（1955年冬入社的28户不计），超过这个水平的有233户，占66％。达到这个水平的有108户，占30.6％。不及这个水平的仅有12户，占3.4％。
    如果取消土地分红，会不会降低社员的收入，影响社员的生活呢？社务委员会曾根据1956年比1955年再增产54.6％的生产计划指标，并且在进一步发挥劳动潜力，提高劳动出勤率的基础上，进行了试算预分，挨家挨户和1955年的收入作了比较，结果是：353户社员中，超过1955年收入的达346户，占98.02％。只有四户完全是老弱病残无劳力户，可以用社的公益金救济。
    第二，三年来社内共积累了公共财产90，250元。其中大部分已用来购买了生产资料，主要的有：载重汽车一辆，大车38辆，新式水车50部，柴油抽水机三部，双轮双铧犁18部，新式步犁八部，播种机三部，喷雾器喷粉器11台，牲畜308头。社会主义经济力量有了显著增长。
    第三，随着社内社会主义经济的增长和土地报酬的逐年降低，社员对土地、牲畜、农具等生产资料的私有观念，已逐渐淡薄，劳动观念进一步加强。大部分贫农和下中农积极要求取消土地分红，许多人过去认为“土地、大牛是靠山”，现在都说“合作社是命根子”。爱劳动、爱集体、爱护公共财产，已经成了全社的风气。
    第四，社内17户孤寡老弱户的生产和生活，都可以得到适当的安排。其中有13户可以分配去养猪、养鸡、养鸭、摘棉、积肥、或是作些农业上的轻微劳动。完全失去劳力的四户，社里每年救济上1，500斤粮食就可以维持生活。社员们说的好：“全社八千多亩土地，细收细打一下，就把他们的生活问题解决了。”事实上，燎原社早就这样作了。
    第五，几年以来，社内已经培养了一批生产领导干部：社务委员15人，正副生产队长36人，各种技术人员和管理人员35人。他们在生产管理、劳动管理、财务管理以及农业技术等方面，已经积累了一套比较完整的经验。全社有共产党员21名、青年团员29名、群众积极分子40多名。这是领导全体社员进行社会主义建设的核心力量。
    仍然是一场尖锐的思想斗争
    燎原社虽然具备了转变为高级社的条件，但是在过渡当中，一些社员思想上仍然发生了激烈的动荡。据王村党支部和燎原社社务委员会调查，381户社员中，对于转高级社这件事积极拥护的有240户，占全体社员的62.8％。其中大部分是贫农和下中农。他们普遍反映“听共产党的话，办高级社没错”。60多岁的社员李应杰说：“我没想到这一辈子还能看上社会主义。”他喜的整天闭不上嘴。当然，也有个别的贫农，对自己用血汗换来的那一小块土地，仍然恋恋不舍。如社员李正高，原来垅地无有，经过多年辛苦劳动，好容易买了一亩地。入社以后，他曾说过：“我没这一亩地，入不了社，翻不了身，这一亩地就是我的命根子。”现在听说要取消土地分红了，他心疼的几夜睡不着觉。但是，当他想到1955年劳动分红八百元，超过他的土地分红一百倍的时候，终于战胜了自己这一点私有心理，举起了拥护的双手。
    对于转高级社既不反对也不积极，表示跟着走的有93户。这一部分人主要是一些土地和劳力相等的中农，政治觉悟不怎么高。不过，他们从自己的体验中证明，几年来跟着共产党走合作化道路的结果，年年增加收入。他们听说要取消土地分红，并没有感到惊慌，他们抱着“怎变怎安排”的态度。
    对于转高级社震动较大的有40多户，主要是一些孤寡老弱和占有土地较多的富裕中农户。其中孤寡老弱户，对走社会主义道路是积极拥护的，但是当他们初次听到要取消土地分红的时候，曾一度产生了恐惧心理。如阎子仲的母亲，一向是靠儿子给留下的养老地过活，她刚刚听到取消土地分红的一点风声，便立刻去找社长，害怕儿子不养活他了。对这些人，只要讲清楚合作社照顾孤寡老弱的政策和办法，他们很快地就会安下心来。占有土地较多的富裕中农，就不是这样了。他们对取消土地分红，有某些抵触情绪。如富裕中农杜凤寿听说要取消土地分红，很不满意，社里通知他去开会，三次都不到，坐在家里闹情绪。
    王村支部和燎原社社务委员会根据社员中的这些情况，除了反复地进行集体主义思想教育和劳动创造世界的教育以外，并积极领导社员对全国五年计划，对全省、全县、全社的生产规划进行了学习和讨论，使社员们从远到近地看到了社会主义建设的美好远景。依照燎原社的生产规划，1956年将在95％的土地上实行机器耕作，要把全部旱田变为水田，棉田要扩大到4，300亩，麦田复播面积将达到90％。这就为大面积丰产打下坚实的基础。在这个基础上，到1962年，全社农业总产值将达到1，390，350元。在生产不断增长的基础上，到1962年，社员每人的平均收入将增加到880元。这一幅幸福生活的图画，在社员们看来，已经不再是什么远景，而是来到眼前的事情了。这不仅对占有土地少的社员是很大的鼓舞，就是对占有土地较多的富裕中农社员，也是一付定心剂。如过去思想抵触较大的翟小五说：“像这样吗，转高级社以后，前途更光明了。”地多劳力少的崔俊常也说：“只要社里的大堆冒起尖来，咱这点土地少收不了几个钱。”经过这段思想教育，绝大部分社员都积极拥护转高级社，社员们的劳动积极性空前提高。现在全社家家户户都在算劳力，订计划，争取在1956年多作劳动日。60多岁的社员翟乐道，在学习和讨论生产规划的时候，很受感动，他编了一个快板，在人群里高兴地唱起来。歌词是：“社员们，鼓劲干，咱社前途大无边。明年铁牛满地跑，两条水渠修成了。村南引水村北浇，机器耕地深又好。地不分红莫要怕，庄稼不长不由它！只要粮食打的多，不愁缺吃不缺喝！”
