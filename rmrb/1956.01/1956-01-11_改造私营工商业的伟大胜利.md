The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in Beijing has reached its climax. In recent days, gongs and drums have been resounding day and night in all districts of the capital, and firecrackers have been set off continuously. Almost every private factory and store on the city's main streets has hung red banners and decorated with lanterns and colorful streamers. Employees and capitalists of private enterprises are jubilant. In recent days, teams of workers and shop assistants celebrating joint state-private ownership, teams of capitalists celebrating joint state-private ownership, and teams of family members of capitalists from various districts celebrating joint state-private ownership have paraded on the streets one after another. At the same time, hundreds and thousands of private industrial and commercial establishments have been approved to implement joint state-private ownership of the entire trade every day. Yesterday alone, another 17,963 private industrial and commercial establishments embarked on the road of joint state-private ownership of the entire trade. So far, the capitalist industry and commerce in Beijing has completely transitioned to the advanced form of state capitalism. This is the first city in the country to implement joint state-private ownership of all capitalist industry and commerce. This is a great victory with national significance for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. This will further promote the movement of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce throughout the country. The proactive action of the capitalists in the capital's industry and commerce is due to their recognition of the trend of our social development and their own future. At the same time, it is also because they recognize that doing so is indeed beneficial to both public and private interests, and is of great benefit to themselves and their future generations. Therefore, they have become active and enthusiastically accepted socialist transformation. The people of the capital and the people of the whole country express warm congratulations to the private industrialists and businessmen in Beijing for accepting socialist transformation and taking the lead in this practical action.

Many private industrialists and businessmen not only enthusiastically celebrate the rebirth of their enterprises with employees and shop assistants, but also contribute off-the-books property to factories and shops. They use such practical actions to express their heartfelt support for socialist transformation. Yang Yanwen, the manager of Yong'an Tang Chinese Pharmacy, voluntarily invested a large number of precious medicinal materials, such as musk, bezoar, and rhinoceros horn, into the joint state-private enterprise. Ma Rongwu, the manager of the First Hotel in Qianmen District, after consulting with his shareholders, voluntarily invested off-the-books property of 159 and a half rooms of buildings, six tile houses, and various fabrics into the enterprise. This spirit and practical action of actively accepting socialist transformation is of great significance in promoting the implementation of joint state-private ownership of private enterprises throughout the city. This kind of action continues to appear in other private industries. We welcome this expression of private industrialists and businessmen, and hope that they will further transform this enthusiasm and initiative into the power to transform enterprises and their own ideology in the future.

The capitalists and the broad masses of employees of private enterprises in Beijing have already demonstrated the necessary socialist enthusiasm through practical actions. In order to consolidate the gains, we should more actively improve production and management. This requires doing a good job in asset verification and equity determination, economic reorganization, and personnel arrangements. In order to accelerate the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee has proposed that capitalists should be primarily responsible for the asset verification of various enterprises, and that capitalists should fill out and report themselves. This method is very good. It has been found that some capitalists, due to their considerable political awareness, are reporting their assets accurately. Now we want to do it quickly and well. On the one hand, this shows the government's trust in the capitalists; on the other hand, it is also a test for the capitalists. This is a good opportunity for capitalists to strive for meritorious service, and they should do this work well in the spirit of seeking truth from facts. While striving for meritorious service, capitalists should also strive to learn politics, business, and technology, transform themselves, and actively assist the government in doing a good job in economic reorganization and enterprise reform, developing production, and reducing costs. In this way, the government will not fail to take care of them in personnel arrangements. In the process of mergers and reorganizations, full attention must be paid to the production and management characteristics of each enterprise. Under no circumstances should the variety of production and management be reduced, or the quality of production and management be reduced, due to the merger of factories and stores. In particular, some more sporadic products that people are accustomed to using should not be neglected in production or management just because they are not the main products. In short, economic reorganization should be carried out comprehensively, realistically, and in a planned manner to meet the needs of developing production and commodity circulation.

Under the new situation of rapid development of socialist construction and socialist transformation, the capital's capitalist industry and commerce has taken the lead in the country's capitalist industry and commerce. We believe that in the future work of transforming capitalist industry and commerce and transforming the bourgeoisie, private industrialists and businessmen throughout the country will continue to make progress and, together with the masses of employees, continue to achieve greater results.

    改造私营工商业的伟大胜利
    北京市对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造已经达到了最高潮。最近几天以来，首都各个区日夜锣鼓喧天，爆竹声连连不断；全市各大街上的私营厂、店，几乎家家都挂上了红幛，到处张灯结彩；私营企业的职工和工商业资本家欢欣鼓舞，连日来，工人店员庆祝公私合营的队伍，资本家庆祝公私合营的队伍，还有各区资本家家属庆祝公私合营的队伍，一队接一队地在街上游行。同时每天都有成百成千的私营工商业户，被批准实行全行业的公私合营。昨天一天又有17，963户私营工商业走上了全行业公私合营的道路。至此，北京市的资本主义工商业已经全部过渡到国家资本主义的高级形式，这是全国第一个全市资本主义工商业实行公私合营的城市。这是对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造的工作带有全国意义的伟大胜利。这将进一步推动全国资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的运动。首都工商业资本家这种积极行动，一方面是由于他们认清了我们的社会发展的趋势，认清了自己的前途，同时，也是由于认清了这样做确实是公私两利，对自己和自己的后代都有极大的好处，因而就积极起来，踊跃地接受社会主义改造。首都人民和全国人民，对于北京市的私营工商业者接受社会主义改造并且走在最前列的这一实际行动，表示热烈的祝贺。
    许多私营工商业者不但和职工、店员们在一起热烈地庆贺企业的新生，并且纷纷拿出帐外的财产投入工厂、商店，他们用这样的实际行动来表示对社会主义改造的衷心拥护。永安堂国药店的经理杨彦文，自动地把大批珍贵的药材，如麝香、牛黄、犀角等投入公私合营企业。前门区第一宾馆经理马荣武同他的股东协商以后，自动把帐外财产159间半楼房和六间瓦房、各种布匹等投入企业。这种积极接受社会主义改造的精神和实际行动，在推动全市私营企业实行公私合营的工作中有很大的意义。这种行动在其他私营行业中也不断地出现。我们欢迎私营工商业者的这种表现，并且希望他们把这种热情和积极性，更进一步变成今后改造企业和改造自己思想意识的力量。
    北京市的私营企业的资本家和广大职工，已经用实际行动表现了应有的社会主义积极性。为了巩固已得的成果，应该更加积极地搞好生产和改善经营。这就要做好清产定股、经济改组以及人事安排等工作。为了加快改造资本主义工商业的速度，北京市人民委员会已经提出由资本家对各企业的清产核资工作负主要责任，由资本家自填、自报的办法。这个办法很好，已经发现有些资本家，由于有了相当的政治觉悟，对于自己的资产，是填报得确实的。现在就要求做到又快又好。这样做，一方面说明政府对资本家的信任；另一方面也是对资本家的一次考验。这正是资本家争取立功的好机会，应该本着实事求是的精神把这项工作做好。资本家在争取立功当中，还应该努力学习政治、业务和技术，把自己改造好，并积极协助政府搞好经济改组和企业改革、发展生产、降低成本，这样，在人事安排中政府是不会不予照顾的。在合并改组过程中，必须充分注意到各企业生产和经营的特点，决不应该因并厂并店而减少生产和经营的品种，或者降低了生产和经营的质量，特别是一些比较零星的为人民所习惯乐用的产品，不能因为它们不是主要产品就不注意生产或经营。总之，经济改组应该全面地实事求是地有计划地进行，以适应发展生产和商品流转的需要。
    在社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业迅速发展的新形势下，首都的资本主义工商业已经走在全国资本主义工商业的前面。我们相信，在今后进行对资本主义工商业的改造和资产阶级分子的改造工作中，全国的私营工商业者一定还会继续进步，和职工群众在一起，继续取得更大的成绩。
