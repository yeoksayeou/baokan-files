Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 1st: The people of the German Democratic Republic are warmly celebrating the 80th birthday of Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, on January 3rd.

Many factories have launched production competitions and completed their 1955 production plans ahead of schedule in order to celebrate Wilhelm Pieck's birthday. Members of the Free German Youth League at the Monsenberg Machine and Tractor Station Training School in Frankfurt worked 1,200 hours of voluntary labor as a gift for President Pieck's birthday, with their voluntary labor valued at 25,000 marks.

Hundreds of congratulatory letters are sent to President Pieck every day, including letters from factory workers reporting the completion of production plans, as well as letters from farmers, Young Pioneers, and housewives.

Workers from Bremerhaven, where Pieck worked for a long time 50 years ago, have sent telegrams of congratulations. Some veteran workers fondly recalled Pieck's time as chairman of the Bremen Carpenters' Union.

More than 60 well-known writers, playwrights, and artists across the country have jointly published a book entitled "Wilhelm Pieck" as a birthday gift. This book contains nearly 70 articles, poems, memoirs, etc. about Pieck.
