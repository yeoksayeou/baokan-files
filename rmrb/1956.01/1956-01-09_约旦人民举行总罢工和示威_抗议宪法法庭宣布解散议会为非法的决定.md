Xinhua News Agency, 8th - According to foreign news agencies: On January 7th, a general strike and demonstrations took place throughout Jordan to protest the Constitutional Court's decision declaring the dissolution of parliament an illegal act. The Jordanian parliament was dissolved after the people opposed the conspiracy to drag Jordan into the Baghdad Pact.
    The Syrian newspaper "Flag" believes that some British figures are worried about holding new parliamentary elections in Jordan, because this election may once again be a blow to the Baghdad Pact and British colonial policy in the Arab East. The newspaper pointed out that some people in Jordan intend to restore the dissolved parliament.
    According to foreign news agency reports, in Amman, the capital of Jordan, demonstrators entered the building of the agency responsible for American "technical assistance". They chanted slogans against the Baghdad Pact. A mass meeting was held next to the government building. On the same day, thousands of people in the Jordanian section of Jerusalem held a demonstration against the Baghdad Pact in front of the American consulate.
    According to a broadcast by Cairo Radio, Jordanian authorities have declared a state of emergency throughout the country after the demonstrations.
    The report said that a committee representing political, agricultural, commercial, student, and labor figures held a meeting in Amman on January 6. After the meeting, a statement was issued demanding rejection of participation in the Baghdad Pact and calling for cooperation with Arab countries.

　　约旦人民举行总罢工和示威
    抗议宪法法庭宣布解散议会为非法的决定
    新华社8日讯　据外国通讯社报道：1月7日，约旦各地举行总罢工和示威游行，抗议宪法法庭作出的关于宣布解散议会是非法行为的决定。约旦议会是在人民反对企图把约旦拖进巴格达条约的阴谋以后解散的。
    叙利亚“旗帜报”认为，一些英国人士担心在约旦举行新的议会选举，因为这次选举可能又是对巴格达条约和英国在阿拉伯东方的殖民政策的一个打击。这家报纸指出，因此在约旦的一些人打算恢复已经解散的议会。
    据外国通讯社的消息说，在约旦首都安曼，示威群众进入了负责美国“技术援助”的机构的大厦。他们高呼反对巴格达条约的口号。在政府大厦旁边举行了群众大会。同一天，耶路撒冷的约旦区有成千的人在美国领事馆前举行了反对巴格达条约的示威。
    据开罗电台广播，在示威发生以后，约旦当局已经宣布全国处于紧急状态。
    消息说，代表政界、农业界、商业界、学生界和劳工界人士的一个委员会1月6日在安曼举行了会议。会后发表声明，要求拒绝参加巴格达条约，并且要求同阿拉伯国家进行合作。
