Xinhua News Agency, January 25th dispatch from Bangkok: Bangkok newspapers report that former Thai parliamentarian Nai Thongyu recently told the press that there are currently too many foreign delegations stationed in Thailand. These delegations, including military advisory groups and economic aid groups, hold considerable real power in Thailand. They often go beyond the role of "friends" and become "guides" for Thailand.

	Nai Thongyu said he will request the Thai Prime Minister not to over-trust the words of these "guides," otherwise the future independence and sovereignty of Thailand will be difficult to imagine.

	On January 7, Thai Liberal Democratic Party member of parliament Nai Ari Tan's Yuchakun, in a campaign speech at a mass rally in Chiang Mai, accused the United States of exerting political pressure on Thailand, causing Thailand's foreign policy to lean unilaterally toward the United States. Nai Ari said that Thailand's policy of leaning solely towards the United States has made it impossible for it to establish genuine friendship with Southeast Asian countries.

	Nai Ari also said that the Thai authorities' recognition of the Taiwan "government" while ignoring the People's Republic of China, which possesses all the people and all the territorial property of the country, is a big mistake.

    “在泰国的外国代表团太多了”
    新华社25日讯　曼谷报纸消息：泰国前议员乃通裕最近向报界发表谈话说，目前驻在泰国的外国代表团实在太多了。这些代表团，包括军事顾问代表团、经济援助代表团等，都在泰国握有一定的实权，他们往往超出“朋友”的身份，而变成泰国的“指导者”。
    乃通裕说，他将请求泰国总理不要过分信任这些“指导者”的言论，否则泰国未来的独立主权将是难于设想的。
    泰国自由民主党议员乃阿里·丹的域差军1月7日在清迈一个群众集会上发表竞选演讲时，指责美国对泰国施加政治压力，使泰国对外政策一面倒向美国。乃阿里说，泰国单独向美国一边倒的政策，已使得它不能同东南亚各国建立真正的友谊。
    乃阿里还说，泰国当局承认台湾“政府”而抹煞拥有全国人民和全部领土财产的中华人民共和国，实在是一个大错误。
