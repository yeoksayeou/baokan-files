    Beijing (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The Beijing Municipal People's Committee convened a meeting on the 19th with responsible persons from various commercial bureaus, specialized companies, and industry trade associations. At the meeting, Beijing Deputy Mayor Cheng Hongyi said that thanks to the efforts of the vast number of employees and the active role played by capitalists, the inventory and asset verification of joint state-private enterprises was carried out well and quickly. The central task at present is to do a good job in business operations.
    He said that in order to further improve business operations, it is necessary to adjust the irrational distribution of the commercial network to meet the needs of urban construction development and consumers. He requested that a comprehensive plan be made step by step by region and industry, and that publicity and mobilization work be carried out well. Industries that are ready and have made preparations should be adjusted immediately, while those that are not yet ready should step up preparations to prevent blind and hasty adjustments. During the adjustment, relevant competent departments should help those industries and stores with difficulties to ensure that the supply work is not affected. He proposed that when adjusting the commercial network, priority should be given to the convenience of consumers, and oppose those hasty adjustments that are made only for the convenience of management. Commercial and service industries suitable for decentralized operation should not be forced to concentrate, and even those that have been organized should operate in multiple locations.
    When talking about business management issues, Cheng Hongyi said that when newly established joint state-private small and medium-sized stores establish business management systems, they must be established gradually according to the specific situation and conditions of the store. If they are not prepared, they can maintain the status quo to avoid affecting business. Special caution should be exercised when dealing with joint state-private "Lianjiapu" (husband-and-wife shops), and generally, migration and merging should not be carried out. The original purchasing, sales, and expenditure systems should not be changed for the time being. Various specialized companies should provide assistance and convenience to them in terms of sources of goods, funds, and allocation procedures. Then study ways to improve.

    北京市布置调整商业网的工作
    北京市人民委员会在19日召集各商业局、专业公司和行业同业公会等系统的负责人举行会议。会上，北京市副市长程宏毅说，由于广大职工的努力和资本家发挥了积极性，公私合营商店清产核资工作作的又好又快。目前的中心任务是做好业务经营工作。
    他说，为了进一步做好业务经营工作，必须把商业网分布不合理的情况加以调整，以适应城市建设发展和消费者的需要。他要求有步骤地按地区和行业进行通盘规划，做好宣传动员工作；已具备条件和作好了准备的行业立即调整，条件不成熟的要加紧准备，防止发生盲目草率调整的现象。在调整中，各有关主管部门要帮助那些有困难的行业和商店，保证做到不影响供应工作。他提出在调整商业网时，要首先考虑对消费者的便利，反对那些只为管理方便轻率调整的现象。适于分散经营的商业和服务性行业，不能勉强集中，即使组织起来的也要分点经营。
    程宏毅在谈到经营管理问题时说，刚公私合营的中、小商店建立经营管理制度时，一定要根据商店的具体情况和条件逐步建立，没有准备好的，可以仍维持原状，以免影响营业。对待实行公私合营的连家铺（夫妻店）要特别慎重，一般的不要进行迁移归并。原有的进货销货和开支制度目前暂时不要改变。各专业公司要在货源资金和调拨手续等各方面对它们给予帮助和方便。然后再研究改进的办法。（据新华社讯）
