Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 19th: According to TASS, the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic unanimously passed the "Law on the Establishment of the National People's Army and the Ministry of National Defense" at its January 18th session. The law stipulates that the National People's Army shall consist of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and that the National People's Army shall be organized and led by the Ministry of National Defense. Prior to this, Deputy Prime Minister Stoph of the German Democratic Republic made a speech on this law at the meeting.

	Stoph said that the People's Chamber and the government have consistently pursued a policy of guaranteeing peace that is entirely in line with the vital interests of the German people. The German Democratic Republic is a bulwark of peace, democracy, and progress in Germany. Therefore, every effort must be made to ensure the maintenance of our worker-peasant state, the achievements of the working people, and the defense capabilities of our republic. Stoph said that faced with the facts of West Germany establishing a mercenary army and West Germany's participation in the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, it is not enough to merely declare the maintenance of peace; it is necessary to strengthen the German Democratic Republic and take measures to ensure the defense capabilities of the republic.

	Stoph then pointed out that the establishment of the National People's Army of the German Democratic Republic is entirely in line with the principles of European collective security and fully complies with the obligations undertaken by the German Democratic Republic under its treaty with the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Treaty.

	Stoph said: The German Democratic Republic will establish a limited army, and the number of personnel in the National People's Army will be limited to the needs of defending the territory of the Republic and protecting the borders of the Republic. The passage of the law on the establishment of the National People's Army and the Ministry of National Defense does not mean the implementation of universal compulsory military service. This is not yet necessary at present.

    德意志民主共和国人民议院通过一项法律
    建立国家人民军和国防部
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社柏林19日讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院在18日会议上一致通过“关于建立国家人民军和国防部的法律”，法律规定国家人民军由陆、海、空三军组成，国家人民军由国防部组织和领导。在这以前，德意志民主共和国副总理斯多夫在会上就这项法律作了发言。
    斯多夫说，人民议院和政府一贯执行着完全符合德国人民切身利益的保证和平的政策。德意志民主共和国是德国和平、民主和进步的堡垒。因此必须尽一切力量保证维护我们工农国家、劳动人民的成果和我们共和国的国防力量。斯多夫说，面临着西德建立雇佣军和西德参加侵略性的北大西洋公约这样的事实，仅仅声明维护和平是不够的，必须加强德意志民主共和国和采取保证共和国国防力量的措施。
    斯多夫接着指出，建立德意志民主共和国国家人民军是完全符合欧洲集体安全的原则的，是完全符合德意志民主共和国根据它同苏联的条约和华沙条约所承担的义务的。
    斯多夫说：德意志民主共和国将建立一支有限的军队，国家人民军的人数将限于保卫共和国领土、保卫共和国边界的任务的需要。通过关于建立国家人民军和国防部的法律并不意味着实行普遍义务兵役制。这在目前还没有必要。
