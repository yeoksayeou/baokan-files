    Dulles Again Advocates "Policy of Strength"
    Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: TASS, New York, January 12th: "Life" magazine published a record of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's conversation with the magazine's reporter, Shepley. From this conversation, it can be seen that Dulles used this opportunity to promote the notorious "position of strength" policy, and to flaunt the policy of atomic weapons, calling it a "deterrent." People here note the fact that just as the demand for further easing of tensions in the world becomes more widespread, and confidence in the success of negotiations to resolve outstanding international issues grows, Dulles is obsessed with permanently maintaining international tensions "on the brink of war." He believes that "being able to go to the edge of war without falling into it" is a "necessary art." Dulles said, "If you cannot master this art, you will inevitably be drawn into war. If you try to avoid doing so, if you are afraid of approaching the edge of the abyss, you will perish... We went to the edge of the abyss and peered into it. We took resolute action."
    In order to defend the "deterrence" policy, Dulles distorted well-known facts.
    Dulles said that the United States has recently been on the "brink of war" three times, namely in Korea, Indochina, and the Taiwan area. According to him, all three times, war was avoided due to "deterrent" actions.
    In this way, Dulles described the achievement of the Korean armistice as the result of the United States taking a "firm stance," when in fact, the United States only agreed to do so after its intervention in the Korean people's affairs had completely failed.
    In the second case, Dulles, disregarding the well-known facts, tried to attribute the agreement reached at the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina to the merits of the United States' firm "united action." He insisted that "the United States' decision to take joint action to save Southeast Asia, and at the same time dispatching the aircraft carriers "Boxer" and "Philippine Sea" with aircraft equipped with atomic weapons to the South China Sea, strengthened France's bargaining position at the first Geneva Conference." In fact, simply recalling that the United States refused to sign the agreement on the Indochina issue in Geneva, and is now obstructing the implementation of the Geneva resolutions, is enough to show that Dulles's statement is completely untenable.
    The third "avoided war" example mentioned by Dulles is the United States' obstruction of "Chinese attack" on Taiwan (should be liberation of Taiwan) by threatening to use American armed forces.
    The facts show that if the United States has been on the "brink of war" in all these three cases, as Dulles said, then this is only the result of the United States implementing a "position of strength" policy, and is only the result of crudely interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. And what stopped the expansion of military conflicts in the Far East was the efforts made by the other side to ease international tensions, and certainly not Dulles's intimidation with atomic bombings. Local political figures also reminded that the three examples cited by Dulles involve Korea, Indochina, and Taiwan, which are issues that need to be resolved without delay. But from Dulles's conversation, it can be seen that he would rather maintain the current tense situation in these areas, and would rather teeter on the "edge of the cliff."
    Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: Washington news: U.S. Secretary of Defense Wilson, when testifying before the Senate Military Committee on January 12, presented the U.S. government's military plan for the 1957 fiscal year, requesting continued intensification of large-scale arms expansion and war preparation.
    Wilson said that the U.S. government's military policy will "basically remain unchanged" in the next fiscal year. "At present, we do not see any major changes in the overall level of our military forces in the coming years."
    Wilson said that in the fiscal year from July 1, this year to June 30, next year, the number of personnel in the U.S. regular army will increase from 2,814,000 to about 2.84 million, and can be further increased to 2,906,000 if necessary. Wilson admitted that the United States is currently severely lacking in personnel. Therefore, the U.S. government will also recruit about 100,000 young people under the plan to establish reserve forces, "80,000 young people will actually participate in six months of active duty training this year."
    In the military plan he proposed, Wilson particularly emphasized strengthening the so-called "retaliatory force," which is to greatly increase the air force and navy forces, as well as atomic weapons. He said that the "main part" of the U.S. Department of Defense's procurement plan for the next fiscal year is to purchase new weapons, including "spending a lot of money to buy missiles." The U.S. Air Force will increase ten more groups, especially long-range bombers. The army units "equipped with new weapons" will also be increased.
    In order to promote this military plan, Wilson requested that the military expenditure for the next fiscal year be increased from about $34.5 billion in the current fiscal year to about $35.5 billion.
    U.S. Government Announces Series of Nuclear Weapon Explosion Tests in Pacific This Spring
    Xinhua News Agency, January 13th: Washington news: The U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Defense issued a joint statement on January 12, saying that the United States will conduct a series of nuclear weapon explosion tests in the Pacific this spring.
    The United States Helps Thailand Expand its Military
    Xinhua News Agency, January 10th: According to United Press International, Bangkok, January 9th:
    Thai Deputy Chief of Staff, Jia Jun Chong, said that the military authorities of the United States and Thailand have reached a consensus to expand the strength of the Thai army to 80,000 fully armed people. This strengthening will increase Thailand's existing seven combat regiments to ten regiments.
    Jia Jun Chong said that because Thailand has added the responsibilities it bears in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, "the United States believes that we are still weak militarily, so they are doing their best to help us."

    美国统治集团抱住“实力政策”不放
    杜勒斯又鼓吹“实力政策”
    新华社13日讯  据塔斯社纽约12日讯：“生活”杂志发表了美国国务卿杜勒斯对这家杂志的记者谢普利的谈话记录。从这篇谈话记录中可以看出，杜勒斯利用这个谈话来宣扬声名狼籍的“实力地位”政策、炫耀原子武器的政策，把这种政策说成是“威慑力量”。这里的人士注意到这个事实：正当世界上对进一步缓和紧张局势的要求日益普遍，对解决悬而未决的国际问题的谈判会取得成效的信心日益增长的时候，杜勒斯却醉心于把国际紧张局势永久保持“在战争的边缘上”。他认为，“能够走到战争的边缘，而又不进入战争”，是一种“必要的艺术”，杜勒斯说，“如果不能掌握这种艺术，你就不可避免地被卷入战争。如果你企图避开这样做，如果你害怕走近深渊的边缘，你就要灭亡……我们走到深渊的边缘，并向之探望。我们采取了坚决的行动”。
    为了替“威慑”政策辩护，杜勒斯歪曲了众所周知的事实。
    杜勒斯说，最近以来美国曾经三度濒于“战争的边缘”，即在朝鲜、在印度支那和在台湾地区。照他说，所有这三次都由于“威慑”的行动而避免了战争。
    这样，杜勒斯就把朝鲜停战的达成说成是美国采取“坚定立场”的结果，而其实，美国是在它对朝鲜人民的干涉彻底破产以后才同意这样做的。
    在第二个事例中，杜勒斯也不顾大家都很清楚的事实，想把1954年日内瓦会议上达成关于印度支那的协定一事，说成是美国坚决采取“联合行动”的功绩。他硬说，“美国决定采取联合行动来拯救东南亚，并且同时派遣带着装备有原子武器的飞机的航空母舰“拳师号”和“菲律宾海号”到中国南海去，这才加强了法国在第一次日内瓦会议上讨价还价的地位。”其实，只要回忆一下，美国在日内瓦拒绝了在关于印度支那问题的协定上签字，而现在又阻挠日内瓦决议的执行，就足以说明杜勒斯的说法是根本站不住脚的。
    杜勒斯提到的第三次“避免了的战争”事例，就是美国以使用美国武装部队为威胁，阻挠“中国人攻击”台湾（应该是解放台湾）。
    事实说明，如果美国在所有这三次都像杜勒斯所说那样濒于“战争的边缘”，那末这只是美国执行“实力地位”政策的结果，只是粗暴地干涉别国内政的结果。而制止了远东军事冲突扩大的，是另一方为缓和国际紧张局势所作的努力，而决不是杜勒斯用原子轰炸来进行的恫吓。当地政界人士还提醒注意到这一点：杜勒斯所引用的三个例子牵涉到朝鲜、印度支那、台湾这几个问题，这些都是需要毫不拖延地加以解决的问题。但是从杜勒斯的谈话中可以看出，他宁愿保持这些地区目前的紧张局势，宁愿摇摇摆摆地站在“悬崖的边缘上”。据新华社13日讯  华盛顿消息：美国国防部长威尔逊1月12日在参议院军事委员会作证的时候，提出了美国政府在1957财政年度的军事计划，要求继续加紧大规模扩军备战。
    威尔逊说，美国政府的军事方针在下一个财政年度“基本上仍然保持不变”。“在目前，我们看不到我们的军事力量的总水平在今后几年里会有任何重大的变化。”
    威尔逊说，从今年7月1日到明年6月30日为止的财政年度内，美国常规军队的兵员数目将从2，814，000人增加到约284万人，必要时再增加到2，906，000人。威尔逊承认，美国目前的兵源十分缺乏，因此，美国政府还将在建立后备军的计划下征募约十万青年，“八万青年在这一年将实际参加为期六个月的现役训练”。
    威尔逊在他提出的军事计划中特别强调要加强所谓“报复性的力量”，也就是要大大增加空军和海军力量以及原子武器。他说，美国国防部在下一个财政年度的采购计划的“主要部分”是购买新式武器，包括“用大笔钱来买飞弹”。美国空军将要增加十个大队，特别是增加长距离轰炸机。陆军“配备新武器”的部队也要增加。
    为了推行这个军事计划，威尔逊要求把下一个财政年度的军费开支从本财政年度的345亿美元左右增加到约355亿美元。
    美国政府宣布今年春季在太平洋进行一系列核子武器爆炸试验
    新华社13日讯  华盛顿消息：美国政府原子能委员会和国防部在1月12日发表一项联合声明说，美国今年春季将在太平洋进行一系列的核子武器爆炸试验。
    美国帮泰国扩军
    据新华社10日讯据合众社曼谷9日消息：
    泰国副参谋总长甲军冲说，美国和泰国的军事当局已取得一致意见，要把泰国军队的实力扩充到具有八万充分武装的人，这种加强将使泰国现有的七团战斗部队增加为十团。
    甲军冲说，由于泰国又加上了在东南亚条约组织中所负的责任，所以“美国认为我们在军事上仍旧是弱的，因此他们正在尽力帮助我们”。
