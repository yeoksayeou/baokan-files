Jingxiang Township in Jiaxing County, Zhejiang, is a water network area with crisscrossing ditches and rivers. Of the township's 5,800+ people, nearly half suffer from schistosomiasis, with young people aged 17 to 21 accounting for over 70% of the total number of cases. Many young people, due to schistosomiasis, are sallow and emaciated, unable to carry even a 50-jin load. Jin A'san, a farmer from Changzibin Village, whose entire family of five, including his wife and children, suffers from schistosomiasis, lacks sufficient labor, resulting in a yield of only 200 jin of rice per mu. Schistosomiasis also seriously affects the completion of agricultural production cooperatives' production increase plans. The Qianliu Agricultural Production Cooperative, composed of 19 farming households, has two-thirds of its 30 laborers suffering from schistosomiasis, making it difficult for the cooperative to achieve its production increase plan.

Thus, relying on the masses and mutual aid and cooperative organizations to carry out schistosomiasis prevention and control work has become a major task for Jingxiang Township. Their methods are: in terms of excrement management, all pigsties along the river or those that do not meet schistosomiasis prevention requirements are consolidated into centralized sheds by natural village or agricultural production cooperative. The manure tanks concentrated in each shed are numbered, stored in rotation, sealed, and used alternately. In terms of water source management, the entire township, by cooperative or natural village, has dug over 90 "sanitary ponds" (for washing chamber pots and manure handling tools), changing the past bad habits of washing chamber pots and manure handling tools in the river. In terms of eliminating snails, the effort is mainly combined with the local farmers' habit of ditching and draining water during winter planting, using soil to bury the snails. Taking the four villages of Zhangjiabin, Yejiaqiao, Dujiatou, and Changzibin in this township as examples, a survey in the autumn of 1954 of 260 ditches found snails in 151 of them. The highest snail density in the ditches was 418 snails per square chi. After the soil burial was carried out in 1954, a comprehensive review was conducted in September 1955, and the number of ditches with snails had been reduced to 60. The average highest density of snails in these 60 ditches was 30 snails per square chi. This gave the masses a very real education. Therefore, in the autumn of 1955, combined with winter planting, ditching, and drainage, more than 880 men, women, and children were organized to carry out a comprehensive snail elimination work on 735 ditches with snails in the entire township within half a month. In terms of patient treatment, among the 84 patients who began treatment in August 1954, no one has been found to have been reinfected after examination to date.

In December 1955, the Jingxiang Township Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Working Group formulated a township-wide plan to eliminate schistosomiasis. More than 5,800 people in the township signed the "Resolution to Resolutely Eliminate Schistosomiasis." The local Party organization has now approved the work plan formulated by the Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Working Group. According to this plan, in addition to the work that has already been carried out, it is also necessary to carry out excrement management of livestock, prohibit water buffalo from entering the river, and dig "cattle bathing ponds" by agricultural production cooperative. For riverbanks with snails, in addition to combining water conservancy construction with soil burial of snails, it is also necessary to carry out drug-based snail elimination. In terms of patient treatment, it is planned to treat over 2,600 schistosomiasis patients in the township in batches using traditional Chinese medicine, Western medicine, or a combination of both, so that schistosomiasis will be basically eliminated in the entire township in 1956.

    浙江净湘乡的血吸虫病防治工作
    本报记者  刘凡  正峰
    浙江嘉兴县的净湘乡，是一个沟河交错的水网地区。全乡5，800多人，近半数患血吸虫病，其中17岁到21岁的青年占发病总人数的70％以上。许多青年因为患血吸虫病，面黄饥瘦，连五十斤重的担子都挑不起来。长子滨村农民金阿三，妻子儿女一家五口都害了血吸虫病，以致劳力不足，每亩地只能收二百斤稻子。血吸虫病也严重地影响了农业生产合作社增产计划的完成。由19户农民组成的茜柳农业生产合作社，30个劳动力中却有三分之二是患血吸虫病的，以致社里增产计划很难实现。
    这样，依靠群众和互助合作组织，进行防治血吸虫病的工作，就成了净湘乡的重大任务。他们的办法是：在粪便管理方面，凡是在河边或不合乎预防血吸虫病要求的粪缸，都以自然村或农业生产合作社为单位分棚集中，并且把各个粪棚内集中的粪缸都编了号，轮流贮粪封缸、交替使用。在水源管理方面，全乡以合作社或自然村为单位共掘了90多个“卫生潭”（供洗马桶及洗粪具用），改变了过去下河洗马桶、洗粪具的坏习惯。在消灭钉螺方面，主要是和当地农民冬种的时候开沟排水的习惯相结合，用土埋钉螺。拿这个乡的张家滨、叶家桥、杜家头、长子滨四个村为例，1954年秋天调查了260条水沟，有钉螺生长的151条，钉螺分布密度最高的水沟每平方市尺是418只。在1954年进行土埋后，1955年9月进行全面复查，有钉螺生长的水沟已减少到60条。这60条水沟的钉螺的分布，平均密度最高的水沟每平方市尺是30只。这件事情给了群众一个非常现实的教育。因此，1955年秋季结合冬种开沟排水，组织了男女老幼880多人，在半个月内就对全乡有钉螺生长的735条水沟进行了一次全面的灭螺工作。在病人的治疗方面，在1954年8月开始治疗的84个病人中，经过检查，到目前还没有发现重复感染得病的人。
    1955年12月，净湘乡的防治血吸虫病工作组制定了消灭血吸虫病的全乡规划。全乡5，800多人都在“为坚决消灭血吸虫病的决心书”上签了名。现在当地党组织已经批准了防治血吸虫病工作组所制定的工作规划。按照这个规划，除了已经进行的工作之外，还要进行对家畜的粪便管理，禁止水牛下河，以农业生产合作社为单位开掘“牛浴池”等工作。有钉螺生长的河滨，除了结合兴修水利土埋钉螺以外，并且要进行药物灭螺。在病人的治疗方面，准备对全乡2，600多个血吸虫病人分批运用中药、西药或中西药结合治疗，使全乡在1956年内基本上消灭血吸虫病。
