Conditions for agricultural machinery tractor stations to receive awards: They have ensured the quality of operations, reduced production costs, completed the state-stipulated annual tasks, and ensured that all land cultivated for agricultural production cooperatives or mutual aid teams has achieved significant production increases, and are supported by the masses.

    III. Standards for Calculating Award-Winning Achievements:
    1. In agriculture, the calculation standard is the average yield per unit area of all crops or certain major crops planted by the awarded production unit (individual farmers, herdsmen, and fishermen are based on households, same below).

    IV. Units or individuals who have already received awards may apply for awards again if the production increase achievement in the following year exceeds the original award-winning record by 10%, or if the average yield per unit area exceeds the original record by less than 10%, but the area of production increase has significantly expanded and exceeds the original record by 10%. If they only maintain the original award-winning record or exceed it by a small amount, they cannot apply for awards again.
    Units or individuals who maintain the original award-winning yield record for three consecutive years from the year of the award can also apply for awards again.
