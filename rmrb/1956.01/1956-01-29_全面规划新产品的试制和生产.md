    Overall Planning for the Trial Manufacture and Production of New Products
    One of the most prominent achievements of China's industrial production in recent years has been the trial manufacture and production of thousands of new products that China could not manufacture in the past. The trial manufacture and production of new products is an extremely important technical policy for China's socialist industrialization and a sign of industrial development. To realize China's socialist industrialization, we must establish an industrial system centered on heavy industry that can independently design and manufacture various means of production. This is the only way to technically guarantee the continuous technical transformation of industry, agriculture, and transportation and the continuous improvement of labor productivity. To accomplish this task, we must establish a large number of large industrial enterprises, learn, master, and implement modern production technology. The trial manufacture and production of new products is one of the important measures to achieve this task, because the process of trial manufacture and production of new products is actually a process of learning and mastering new technologies, improving the technical level of enterprises, and cultivating independent design and manufacturing capabilities. The results of new product production in the past few years have played a huge role in this regard.
    Now, the pace of socialist construction and socialist transformation in our country is accelerating. We not only have the possibility of completing the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, but also the possibility of completing the general task of the transition period ahead of schedule. Faced with this situation, the development of new products must advance at a faster speed, providing more and better technical conditions for the development of industry and agriculture more fully than in the past. This is an urgent and glorious task placed before the industrial sector.
    Experience in recent years has proved that in order to rapidly develop new products, all industrial sectors must immediately strengthen their leadership and overall planning for this work, thoroughly solve long-term development issues, and comprehensively organize this work. We must approach or reach the world's advanced level in the main aspects of science and technology in a not very long period of time, and we must learn to design and manufacture all the new product technologies we need in the world in a not very long period of time. For this purpose, we must truly understand the needs of all aspects of the national economy, comprehensively consider the development of industrial production and capital construction, the development of this sector and the development of other sectors, economic construction and people's lives, main products and secondary products, urgent and slow-moving, current and future needs, and so on. Based on China's industrial production capacity and technical level, we must formulate plans for the development of new products for each enterprise for a considerable period of time, determine the variety, specifications, quantity, and steps of trial manufacture and production. On this basis, we can determine the direction of technological development of enterprises, divide the scope of trial manufacture of new products, and stipulate the steps for technological transformation of enterprises; we can also determine whether it is necessary to build or expand workshops, whether it is necessary to add equipment or change production methods and labor organization, in order to learn and master new technologies and enable enterprises to have independent manufacturing capabilities. The planning should have a socialist revolutionary spirit, and all departments should strive to approach and catch up with the world's most advanced technical level in a not very long period of time.
    In order to ensure the smooth trial manufacture and production of new products, it is necessary to further strengthen the scientific research and testing work and product design work of industrial departments, and make technical preparations for the trial manufacture and production of new varieties. All departments must allocate capable technical personnel to enrich the scientific research institutions of industrial departments as soon as possible, improve product design institutions, vigorously carry out research and design of new products, formulate and strictly implement formal technical regulations and operating procedures, and systematically promote advanced experiences that are decisive for new products in a planned manner. In the trial manufacture process, it is necessary to strengthen the inspection and technical summary work of the intermediate process, and solve technical difficulties in a timely manner. After the trial manufacture is successful, the products should be inspected according to technical standards, technical summaries should be carried out, and the original technical conditions and regulations should be revised and supplemented, and then formally put into production.
    All industrial departments should also strengthen specific leadership over the development of new products in various enterprises. Each industrial ministry, especially each specialized bureau, should designate a main leading staff member to personally lead and plan this work, and should set up specialized personnel in relevant functional institutions to strengthen management, establish necessary inspection and summary systems, specifically grasp the progress, and solve problems in a timely manner. It is necessary to make every factory director and chief engineer of every enterprise seriously manage this work. Here, it should be particularly pointed out that all ministries should quickly establish a reward system for the development of new products. Mastering new technologies and producing new products is a new task in our country, and there are many difficulties. Industrial leaders should cherish every achievement made by their subordinate enterprises in this regard and give them encouragement frequently. Specifically, the trial manufacture costs of new products can generally not be included in the cost; when the new product is successfully trial-manufactured but has not yet been finalized and is in small-batch trial production, there should be new quotas, that is to say, preferential treatment should be given in terms of quotas and costs; not only should enterprises and individuals who complete the task of trial manufacture and production of new products be greatly rewarded, but also enterprises and individuals who have worked hard but have basically completed the task due to some difficulties should be rewarded. For those who have a poor completion rate of the task, for example, only 20% of the task is completed, or the task is not completed at all (although this situation does not actually exist), if its technicians, workers, and managers are indeed active and hardworking, but the new product has not been successfully trial-manufactured due to certain technical conditions and other difficulties that cannot be overcome for a while, they should also be encouraged. If the first attempt fails, they should continue to work hard for the second and third trial manufacture until it succeeds, and should not simply be blamed.
    Strengthening cooperation between various industrial departments and creating conditions for each other is an indispensable and important condition for ensuring the completion of the development of new products. No enterprise in our country is isolated, and must rely on other enterprises to supply materials, equipment or components and parts for production under the guidance of the entire national plan, and at the same time supply other enterprises with materials, equipment or components and parts. With the development of industry, the professional division of labor between enterprises will become more and more detailed, and the work of trial manufacture and production of new products requires this kind of collaboration even more. In cooperation, the departments that need new products should not only put forward ordering plans and varieties and specifications as early and completely as possible, but also provide necessary technical data, submit re-examination results on time, and quickly submit the required quantities. In the past, some ordering units completely did not understand the difficulties of the contracting enterprises, and did not prepare when submitting ordering plans, and did not give the contracting units preparation time; or only emphasized the need, neither providing technical data, nor submitting specifications, nor submitting the results of re-examination in a timely manner, so that the trial-manufactured new products could not be put into production for a long time. These practices should be corrected immediately.
    Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "We are now not only carrying out a revolution in the social system from private ownership to public ownership, but also carrying out a revolution in technology from handicraft production to large-scale modern machine production, and these two revolutions are combined together." Our country is undergoing these two revolutions. In the process of industrial technology revolution, the work of increasing new products will play an important role. The earlier this work starts and the faster it develops, the greater the benefits to the development of the national economy. Of course, we still have many technical difficulties at present, but as long as the industrial departments strengthen leadership and comprehensively plan, we will be able to overcome difficulties and make further achievements in the work of trial manufacture and production of new products.

    全面规划新产品的试制和生产
    我国工业生产几年来的突出成就之一，是各个工业部门，试制和生产了数千种过去我国不能制造的新产品。试制和生产新产品，是我国社会主义工业化的一项极为重要的技术政策，也是工业发展的标志。实现我国的社会主义工业化，必须建立以重工业为中心的、能够独立设计和制造各种生产资料的工业体系，这才能在技术上保证工业、农业和运输业不断地进行技术改造和不断地提高劳动生产率。想完成这个任务，就要建立为数很多的大工业企业，就要学习掌握和贯彻实现近代的生产技术。试制和生产新产品，正是实现这一任务的重要措施之一，因为试制和生产新产品的过程，实际上是学习和掌握新技术、提高企业技术水平、培养独立设计和制造能力的过程。过去几年生产新产品的结果，在这方面已发挥了巨大的作用。
    现在，我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造的步伐加快了，我们不但有可能提前完成第一个五年计划，而且有可能提前完成过渡时期的总任务。在这一形势面前，发展新产品的工作，就要以更快的速度前进，要比过去更多地、更快地、更好地给工业、农业的发展提供更充分的技术条件。这是摆在工业部门面前紧迫的、光荣的任务。
    几年来的经验证明，要迅速发展新产品，各工业部门必须立即加强对这一工作的领导和全面规划，彻底解决长远的发展问题，把这一工作全面地组织起来。我们必须在不很长的时期内在科学技术的主要方面接近或者赶上世界的先进水平，必须在不很长的时间内，学会设计和制造世界上所有的我们需要的一切新产品的技术。为了这个目的，就要切实了解国民经济各个方面发展的需要，全面考虑到工业生产和基本建设、本部门的发展和其他部门的发展、经济建设和人民生活、主要产品和次要产品、急需的和缓用的、目前的和将来的需要等等。根据我国工业生产能力和技术水平，必须订出各企业相当长时间内的发展新产品的计划，确定品种、规格、数量、试制和生产的步骤。在这个基础上，才能确定企业的技术发展方向，划分试制新产品的范围，规定企业技术改造的步骤；也才能确定是否需要新建或扩建车间，是否需要增添设备或改变生产方法和劳动组织，以便于学习和掌握新的技术，使企业具有独立制造的能力。在规划中要有社会主义的革命精神，所有的部门都要争取在一个不很长的时间内，接近和赶上世界上最先进的技术水平。
    为了保证顺利地进行新产品的试制和生产，要进一步加强工业部门的科学研究和试验工作以及产品的设计工作，作好试制和生产新品种的技术准备。各部门必须尽快地抽调得力的技术人员充实工业部门的科学研究机构，健全产品设计机构，大力开展新产品的研究和设计工作，制定和严格执行正规的技术规程和操作规程，并且有计划地、系统地推广对新产品有决定意义的先进经验。在试制过程中，要加强中间过程的检验和技术总结工作，及时解决技术上的困难。试制成功以后，要按照技术标准对产品进行检查，进行技术总结，修改和充实原订的技术条件和规程，然后再正式投入生产。
    各工业部门还应当加强对各企业发展新产品工作的具体领导。各工业部，特别是各专业局，应该指定一个主要领导工作人员亲自领导和规划这一工作，并且要在有关职能机构中设立专门人员，加强管理，建立必要的检查和总结制度，具体掌握进度，及时解决问题。要使每一个企业的厂长和总工程师都认真管理这一工作。在这里要特别指出，各部要迅速建立发展新产品的奖励制度。掌握新技术和生产新产品，在我国是一件新的工作，困难是很多的。工业领导部门要爱护所属企业在这方面获得的每一个成就，经常给他们以鼓励。具体说来，新产品试制费一般的可以不摊入成本；新产品试制成功但尚未定型而在小批试验生产时要有新的定额，就是说要在定额和成本方面给予优待；不但要大大奖励那些完成试制和生产新产品任务的企业和个人，而且要奖励那些经过努力但因某种困难而基本上完成任务的企业和个人。对于完成任务差的，比如说只完成任务20％，或者根本没有完成任务（虽然这种情况实际上不存在）的企业，如果它的技术人员、工人、管理人员确实是积极的、努力的，只是因为某些技术条件和其它一时无法克服的困难，使得新产品未能试制成功，也应该鼓励他们，第一次失败了，再继续努力进行第二次、第三次的试制，直到成功为止，而不要单纯加以责备。
    加强各工业部门之间的协作，相互创造条件，是保证完成发展新产品工作的不可缺少的重要条件。我国的任何一个企业，都不是孤立的，都要在整个国家计划指导下，依靠别的企业供给材料、设备或者部件和零件来进行生产，同时供应别的企业以材料、设备或者部件和零件。随着工业的发展，企业间的专业分工会愈来愈细，试制和生产新产品的工作更需要这种协作。在协作中，需用新产品的部门不仅要尽早地、完整地提出订货计划和品种规格，而且要供应必要的技术资料，按时提出复验结果，迅速提出需要的数量。过去，有些订货单位完全不体谅承制企业的困难，提订货计划时无准备，不给承制单位以准备时间；或者只强调需要，既不提出技术资料，也不提出规格，又不及时提出复验的结果，以致试制的新产品迟迟不能投入生产。这些做法应该马上纠正。
    毛泽东同志指示我们说：“我们现在不但正在进行关于社会制度方面的由私有制到公有制的革命，而且正在进行技术方面的由手工业生产到大规模现代化机器生产的革命，而这两种革命是结合在一起的。”我国正在进行这两种革命。在工业技术革命过程中，增加新产品的工作将发挥重要的作用。这个工作开始得愈早，发展得愈快，对国民经济发展的好处就愈大。当然，目前我们在技术上还有不少困难，但是，只要各工业部门加强领导，全面规划，我们就能够克服困难，使试制和生产新产品的工作获得进一步的成就。
