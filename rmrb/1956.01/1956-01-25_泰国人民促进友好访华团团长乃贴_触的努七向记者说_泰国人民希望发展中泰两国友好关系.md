Xinhua News Agency, January 24th: Nai Tepi Touch's Nuqi, the leader of the Thai People's Promotion of Friendship to China Delegation, told Chinese and foreign reporters in Beijing today that the Thai people hope to develop friendly relations between China and Thailand and promote the normalization of relations between the two countries. He pointed out that the delegation's visit to China has received the support of the Thai people and Thai public opinion.

Nai Tepi Touch's Nuqi is the leader of the Thai Economic Party and a member of the Thai National Assembly. In answering questions from reporters, he said, "As the leader of the Thai People's Promotion of Friendship to China Delegation, I believe that Sino-Thai relations should be improved. The visit of the delegation to China is a bridge for developing friendly relations between China and Thailand. The friendly relations between China and Thailand have a long history. Not only do the people of the two countries have close racial ties, but the two countries are also close neighbors." He believes that friendly relations between the two countries should be promoted in all aspects. Mutual visits between people's organizations of the two countries are conducive to the development of friendly relations between the two countries. He hopes that more Thai women, youth, and religious groups will visit China in the future.

Speaking of trade relations between China and Thailand, Mr. Touch pointed out that if Thai goods can be exported to China, "Thailand's foreign trade will have great development." Mr. Touch said that China and Thailand have not yet established normal trade relations, but a considerable amount of Chinese goods has been imported into Thailand, which shows that China already has the possibility of exporting to Thailand. Thailand also has goods such as rice and rubber that can be exported to China. Mr. Touch also said that since Thailand currently only trades with countries that have normal diplomatic relations, Thai goods are looking for markets, and the market for Thai goods has also been subjected to difficulties and even plundering. He hopes that with the normalization of relations between China and Thailand, trade relations between the two countries will also develop.

Mr. Touch advocated peaceful coexistence between countries. He said: "What we need is mutual understanding and friendship, not hostility. Different social systems should not become barriers between countries."

The leader of the Economic Party said when talking about the Economic Party's foreign policy that "The Economic Party's foreign policy is to support the United Nations organization and is willing to cooperate with countries around the world." Mr. Touch pointed out that some countries are currently unable to enter the United Nations, so the resolutions made by the United Nations are not comprehensive and are not conducive to world peace. He also pointed out that for the sake of world peace, the current phenomena of mutual suspicion and fear in the world should be eliminated and the Cold War must be stopped.

Speaking of his impressions of New China, Mr. Touch said that although he has only been to China for a few days, he has already seen that New China is committed to economic construction and improving people's lives. New China has only been established for six years, but its achievements have exceeded the time. He said: "If I come to visit China again in five years, I will be even more surprised than I am now."

At a press conference lasting two hours, Mr. Touch also introduced the domestic situation in Thailand. More than 30 Chinese and foreign reporters in Beijing attended the press conference.

    泰国人民促进友好访华团团长乃贴·触的努七向记者说
    泰国人民希望发展中泰两国友好关系
    新华社24日讯　泰国人民促进友好访华团团长乃贴·触的努七今天向在北京的中外记者说，泰国人民希望发展中泰两国的友好关系和促进两国关系的正常化。他指出，代表团来中国访问受到了泰国人民和泰国舆论的支持。
    乃贴·触的努七是泰国经济人党的领袖、泰国国会议员，他在答复记者们的问题时说，“作为泰国人民促进友好访华团的团长，我认为中泰关系应该得到改善。访华团来中国访问就是发展中泰友好关系的一个桥梁。中泰两国间的友好关系由来已久，不但两国人民在种族上有着密切的关系，而且两国又是近邻。”他认为应该从各方面来促进两国的友好关系，两国人民团体的互相访问，是有利于两国友好关系的发展的，他希望以后继续有泰国的妇女、青年和宗教团体来中国访问。
    贴先生在谈到中泰两国的贸易关系时指出，如果泰国的货物能向中国输出，“泰国的对外贸易将会有很大的发展”。贴先生说，中泰两国现在还没有建立正常的贸易关系，但中国已有相当多的货物输入到泰国，这说明中国已经有向泰国输出的可能性。泰国也有大米和橡胶等货物是可以向中国输出的。贴先生又说，由于泰国目前仅仅同那些有正常外交关系的国家进行贸易，因此泰国的货物正在寻找市场，而且泰国货物的市场还受到了其他方面的刁难甚至抢夺。他希望随着中泰两国关系的正常化，两国间的贸易关系也随着发展起来。
    贴先生主张各国之间的和平共处。他说：“我们需要的是互相了解和友谊，不是敌视。不同的社会制度不应该成为阻碍各国之间的堤坝。”
    这位经济人党的领袖在谈到经济人党的对外政策时说，“经济人党的对外政策是支持联合国机构，愿意与世界各国进行合作。”贴先生指出目前某些国家不能进入联合国，因此联合国作出的决议是不全面的，对世界和平是不利的。他又指出为了世界和平，目前世界上存在的互相猜疑、恐惧的现象应该消除，冷战必须停止。
    在谈到对新中国的观感时，贴先生说虽然他来到中国只有短短几天，但是已经看到新中国在致力于经济建设和提高人民生活。新中国建立才六年，但它的成就是超过了时间的。他说：“假如五年以后我再来访问中国的话，我将会比现在更为惊讶。”
    贴先生在历时两小时的记者招待会上，还介绍了泰国的国内情况。参加这次招待会的有北京的中外记者30多人。
