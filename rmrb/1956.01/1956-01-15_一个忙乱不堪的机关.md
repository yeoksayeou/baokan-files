    We demand the establishment of normal work and life order
    Editor's Note: The appeal from a female youth league member of a certain organization published on the "Reader's Letters Page" on January 8, requesting a guarantee of leisure time, has aroused concern and resonance among readers. The following three letters continue to present opinions on this matter.

    To reasonably resolve the issue of leisure time for staff in organizations, the key lies in the reasonable work arrangement by the organization's leadership. The reason why many staff members in organizations do not get the rest they deserve is, just like the situation in various organizations in the Datai Residential Area of Beijing and the Xuanwu District Committee of the Communist Youth League, either due to dragging work or excessive meetings. In order to enable the staff members of organizations to maintain a normal work and life order, and to have the necessary time for rest, recreation, and taking care of family life, all organizations with chaotic work situations need to examine and analyze their work situation and improve it.
    A Chaotic Organization
    Editor:

    The situation reflected in the letter from a female youth league member of a certain organization also exists in many organizations. The staff of the Xuanwu District Committee of the Communist Youth League in Beijing are often busy from morning till night, and cannot even rest on Sundays.

    This organization is nominally on an eight-hour work system, but in reality, staff members' leisure time is often occupied by work and meetings. Many people have to work until 11 pm or even later every night, cannot rest at noon, and cannot rest on Sundays. This situation of being busy and chaotic all day long increases everyone's fatigue.

    The busiest is Yang Ruoxian, the secretary of the District Committee of the Youth League. She has two children, the older one in a nursery and the younger one cared for by a nanny at home. Due to the heavy workload and many meetings, she rarely has time to care about the children on weekdays, and sometimes she cannot even pick up the child from the nursery for weeks. Yang Ruoxian is studying at the Marxist-Leninist Night University affiliated to the Renmin University of China. Because she is busy, she often asks for leave and has no time to review her lessons. Just how busy is Yang Ruoxian? Let's look at her situation from December 18 to 24, 1955: In six days, she spent four mornings, two afternoons, and four evenings in nine meetings convened by the Xuanwu District Committee of the CCP, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, and her own organization. She spent four afternoons and one evening listening to five reports, one morning giving a report to all district league cadres, and one morning talking to comrades from the Cadre Section of the Municipal Committee of the Youth League. In this way, except for one evening when she attended night university (originally night university was to be attended twice a week, but she had to ask for leave once because she had to attend a meeting), she was busy with meetings and reports day and night. It is worth noting that this is not a temporary phenomenon, her work situation has always been like this.

    The situation of other staff members of the Xuanwu District Committee of the Communist Youth League is not much better than that of Yang Ruoxian. For example, Song Yunru of the School Work Department has three children, the oldest is five years old and the youngest is just over two months old. Since she started working after her maternity leave expired on December 2, 1955, she has had work and meetings every Sunday, sometimes taking up the whole day, in addition to often having things to do in the evenings.

    It is understood that this situation exists in the youth league organizations of other districts in Beijing, and even in the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League. I think the relevant leaders of these organizations should reasonably arrange work and meeting times, study and improve work methods, and ensure that everyone has the necessary rest time.

### 一个忙乱不堪的机关

    我们要求建立正常的工作和生活秩序
    编者按：1月8日“读者来信专页”发表的某机关一个女青年团员要求保证业余时间的呼吁，引起了读者的关怀和共鸣。下面发表的三封来信，继续提出了这方面的意见。
    要合理解决机关工作人员的业余时间问题，关键在于机关领导方面合理安排工作。不少机关的工作人员所以得不到应有的休息，原因正像北京市大台小区各机关和青年团宣武区委员会的情况一样，或者是由于工作拖拉，或者是由于会议过多。为了使机关的工作人员保持正常的工作和生活的秩序，能够得到应有的休息、娱乐和照料家庭生活的时间，一切工作忙乱的机关，有必要检查和分析一下工作情况，加以改进。
    一个忙乱不堪的机关编辑同志：
    某机关一个女青年团员的来信中所反映的情况，在不少机关中也是存在的。青年团北京市宣武区委员会的工作人员们，就经常每天从早忙到晚，星期天也得不到休息。
    这个机关名义上是八小时工作制，但是实际上工作人员的业余时间常常被工作和会议所占据。很多人每天晚上要忙到11点甚至更晚，中午得不到休息，星期天也不能休息。这种整天忙乱不堪的情况增加了大家的疲劳。
    最忙的是团区委书记杨若先。她有两个孩子，大的在托儿所，小的在家里请保姆看管。由于工作忙、会议多，她平日很少有时间去过问孩子们的事情，有时一连几个星期顾不上接托儿所的孩子回家。杨若先在中国人民大学附设马克思列宁主义夜大学学习，因为忙，常常请假，更没有时间温习功课。杨若先究竟忙到什么程度呢？拿她在1955年12月18日到24日六天的情况看吧：六天中，她有四个上午、两个下午和四个晚上的时间是在中共宣武区委会、青年团北京市委会和本机关召开的九个会议中度过的，有四个下午和一个晚上听了五个报告，有一个上午用来向全区团的干部作报告，有一个上午同团市委干部科的同志谈话。就这样，她除了有一个晚上上夜大学学习（本来夜大学每星期要上两次课，有一次课她因为要参加会议而只得请假了）以外，其余的白天黑夜，一直是为会议和报告忙碌着。值得注意的是，这并不是一时的现象，她的工作情况一直是这样的。
    青年团宣武区委会的其他工作人员忙乱的情况比杨若先也好不了多少。像学校工作部的宋云茹有三个孩子，大的已经五岁，小的才两个多月。她从1955年12月2日产假期满开始上班以后到现在，除了晚上常常有事情以外，每个星期天也都有工作和会议，有的时候要占一整天。
    据了解，这种情况在北京市其他区的青年团机关里，甚至在青年团北京市委会里都是有的。我觉得这些机关的有关领导方面应该合理安排工作和会议时间，研究改进工作方法，保证大家都有必要的休息时间。
