Xinhua News Agency, Paris, January 4th: According to TASS, the French Communist Party issued a statement on the results of the French National Assembly elections on the evening of January 3rd. The statement said that the number of votes obtained by Communist candidates was more than 400,000 higher than in the June 1951 parliamentary elections, and the number of seats it obtained increased by 54. The Communist Party warmly thanks the 5.5 million men and women voters who voted in favor of its candidates and its program, and who support the unity of the working people and a new people's front. The establishment of such a people's front is a necessary condition for changing French policy, and the results of the January 2nd election make the establishment of this front possible.

The statement said: The election results show that the people want to end the government's reactionary, poverty-stricken and war-mongering policies, and to end the policies that favor fascism and pose a serious threat to democratic freedoms. Voters condemned this policy and ousted many of its representatives. The large number of votes cast by voters not only for the Communist Party but also for the Socialist Party and other left-wing parties that declared opposition to the government demonstrates the French people's desire to implement policies of social progress, democracy and peace.

If the proposals we made to the Socialist Party regarding the formation of an electoral alliance could be accepted, then this trend to the left would be even more pronounced.

The statement pointed out that Communists, Socialists and other Republicans who advocate changing policies can only have a majority in the new National Assembly if they reach an agreement among themselves. Therefore, it is now possible to give the people the government they desire and to break the reactionaries' conspiracy to unite with the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party to continue their harmful cause.

The statement said that today, without the Communists, without the assistance of their 150 members of parliament, no left-wing majority, no left-wing policy is possible. The French Communist Party reiterates its willingness to reach an agreement with the Socialist Party to implement new policies that are in the interests of the people and the country, and the Communist Party is also willing to form an alliance with other left-wing parties with the same goals.

　　法共就国民议会选举结果发表声明
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：法国共产党3日晚就法国国民议会选举结果发表声明。声明说，共产党候选人所获得的票数比1951年6月的议会选举多了四十多万票，它所获得的席位多了54席。共产党热烈地感谢550万投票拥护它的候选人和它的纲领、赞成劳动人民的团结和新的人民阵线的男女选民。建立这种人民阵线是改变法国政策所必需的条件，而1月2日的选举结果使得这一阵线的建立成为可能。
    声明说：选举结果表明，人民希望终止政府的反动、贫穷和战争政策，终止那种有利于法西斯主义，对民主自由造成严重威胁的政策。选民谴责这种政策，驱逐了这种政策的许多代表人物。选民不仅对共产党而且对社会党和其他声明反对政府的左翼党派投了大量的选票，这就表示了法国人民对执行社会进步、民主和和平政策的愿望。
    如果我们向社会党提出的关于结成选举联盟的建议能被接受的话，那么这种向左转的趋势还要更加显著。
    声明指出，主张改变政策的共产党人、社会党人和其他共和人士，只有在他们之间达成协议，才能在新的国民议会中拥有多数。因此，现在有可能给予人民一个他们所理想的政府，有可能打破反动派想同社会党和激进社会党联合以继续它有害的事业的阴谋。
    声明说，今天没有共产党人，没有他们的150个议员的协助，任何左翼的多数，任何左翼的政策都是不可能的。法国共产党重申它愿意同社会党取得协议，以执行符合人民和国家的利益的新政策，共产党也愿意同具有同样目标的其他左翼党派结成联盟。
