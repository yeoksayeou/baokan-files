　　Hainan Island Sounds the Bugle Call for a Great Leap in Production

　　While most parts of the country are entering the depths of winter, the spring plowing season has already arrived in the southern frontier of the motherland – Hainan Island.
　　In the southeastern coastal counties of the island, where the season starts earliest, Wanning, Lehui, Qiongdong, and the southern part of Wenchang, new seedlings have been planted since the late part of December 1955, and now it is a lush green. In the fields of the agricultural production cooperatives, here, a dozen people are busy transplanting seedlings, there, three or four water buffaloes are plowing and harrowing the land. Particularly attractive is the fact that the seedlings in many fields are planted very neatly. Comrade Fu Yuying, a cadre who is helping the Houling Agricultural Cooperative in Qiongdong County with production, pointed out to the reporter with satisfaction: "In the cooperative's fields, no matter which direction you look from, straight, horizontal, or diagonal, the seedlings are all in a straight line." How can a dozen people plant so neatly? This puzzling question can be answered if you walk to the edge of a field where seedlings are being transplanted: after the cooperative members finish planting a section in front of them, they pick up a wooden-framed grid from the mud. They plant the seedlings according to the grid. It turns out that the method of close planting of small seedlings is now beginning to be widely promoted here. In order to ensure compliance with the standards, when their skills are not yet proficient, the cooperative members use this wooden frame as a tool.
　　In 1955, the farmers of Hainan Island overcame a major drought that lasted seven or eight months, a force twelve typhoon, as well as floods and insect pests. The struggle against natural disasters educated the peasants, and the vast number of peasants more urgently demanded to take the socialist road. After two batches of cooperative establishment before and after the autumn harvest, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives on the island has increased from 9.4% to 42% of the total number of peasant households, and more than 9,790 cooperatives have been built, forming the main force on the production front. In order to prevent drought, 86 large and medium-sized water conservancy projects will be built throughout the island this winter and spring. The key projects of blocking rivers for irrigation in the Nandu River and Panshui River have already started one after another; all large and small water conservancy projects will expand the irrigated area by more than 837,000 mu. A manure accumulation campaign is also underway, with toilets being built everywhere, and cattle pens and pigsties being constructed. The goal for this year is to apply 1,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. Technological reforms centered on the method of close planting of small seedlings have begun to be widely promoted on the basis of key experiments, and this year it will reach 45% of the rice planting area. All these tasks are even more guaranteed with the existence of more agricultural production cooperatives. On the eve of the spring plowing, the Qiongshan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered that there was insufficient preparation of base fertilizer. Around December 10, 1955, it launched agricultural cooperatives to take the lead in launching a manure accumulation campaign, accumulating more than 40 million jin of manure in ten days, satisfying the need for base fertilizer for the early rice fields. On December 21, the County Party Committee convened a meeting of agricultural production cooperative technicians from all over the county. This meeting focused on discussing the issue of improving transplanting techniques. Agricultural cooperatives that had achieved significant results in adopting “seedling fertilizer” (seedling fertilizer is a method of fertilization that applies fertilizer to the roots of seedlings, which are then transplanted into the field, which can not only promote strong and cold-resistant seedlings and rapid regrowth, but also save fertilizer and labor), insect control in seedling fields, and close planting of small seedlings reported on their experiences at the meeting. After discussions, demonstrations, and visits, this meeting achieved good results. Various cooperatives have put forward challenges and launched a competition to promote technological reforms during spring plowing.
　　The call to march towards a great leap in production has sounded from a corner of Hainan Island. The Hainan District Party Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided that from the end of December 1955, all meetings in rural areas of the district that can be postponed or suspended should be postponed or suspended. The Party rectification work in rural areas of the whole district, which was originally planned to begin in late December, has also been postponed to February and March 1956. Party organizations at all levels in Hainan Island are fully leading spring plowing and production, to ensure that peasants can plant more than two million mu of early rice fields well and celebrate the Spring Festival happily.

　　海南岛响起了向生产大进军的号角
    陈浚
    当全国大部分地区正进入隆冬的时候，春耕季节已经来到了祖国的南部边疆——海南岛。
    岛上季节最早的东南沿海各县，万宁、乐会、琼东和文昌的南部，从1955年12月下旬开始插上新秧，现在已是一片青葱。农业生产合作社的田畦里，这边，十来个人在紧张地插秧，那边，三、四头水牛在犁地、耙地。特别吸引人的，是许多田里秧苗插得十分整齐。帮助琼东县后岭农业社生产的干部符玉英同志，满意地指点给记者：“社的田里，不管你从那个方向望去，直的、横的、对角的，秧苗都是一条线。”十来个人怎么能插得这般齐呢？这个叫人纳闷的问题，只要你走到正在插秧的田边，就能找到你所想像不到的答案：社员们插完面前的一段，就从泥水里起出一个木条钉的格子框，他们是按着格子插秧的。原来这里正在开始普遍推广小棵密植法。社员们为了保证合乎规格，在技术还不熟练的时候，利用了这种木框做工具。
    1955年，海南岛的农民是在同延续七、八个月的大旱、十二级的台风以及水灾、虫害的斗争里过来的。同自然灾害的斗争教育了农民，广大农民更加迫切地要求走社会主义的道路。经过秋前和秋后两批建社，全岛入社的农户已经从占农户总数的9.4％发展到42％，共建成了9，790多个社，组成了生产战线上的主力军。为了防止旱灾，这一个冬春，全岛要修筑86项大型和中型的水利工程。南渡江和泮水河两处堵流灌溉的重点工程已经先后开工；全部大小水利工程，将扩大灌溉面积837，000多亩。积肥运动也在开展起来，到处在修厕所，建筑牛栏、猪圈。今年的目标是每亩地要上底肥一千斤。以小棵密植法为中心的技术改革，在重点试验的基础上，开始普遍推广，今年要达到水稻播种面积的45％。所有这许多工作，在有了更多的农业生产合作社以后，就有了更大的保证。春耕前夕，中共琼山县委发现底肥准备不足，在1955年12月10日前后，发动农业社带头掀起积肥运动，十天积肥四千多万斤，满足了早造田需要的底肥。县委又在12月21日召开了全县农业生产合作社技术员会议。这次会议集中讨论了改进插秧技术的问题。采用“秧头肥”（秧头肥是一种施肥的方法，把肥料带在秧根上，插到田里，既能促使秧苗健壮、耐寒、回青快，又能省肥料和人工）、秧田除虫和小棵密植有显著成绩的农业社，在会上报告了他们的经验。经过讨论，表演和参观，这次会议收到了良好的效果。各个合作社纷纷提出挑战，开展春耕中推行技术改革的竞赛。
    向生产大进军的号声，从海南岛一角响起来了。中共海南区党委已经决定从1955年12月下旬起，全区的农村里一切可以缓开和停开的会议，都要缓开和停开。原来计划从12月下旬开始的全区农村整党工作，也延迟到1956年2、3月间进行。海南岛的各级党组织正在全力领导春耕生产，要保证农民种好二百多万亩的早造田，欢欢喜喜地过春节。
